[Music]

37.789 --> 46.949
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.76 --> 52.218999999999994
early-bird number 148 I'm your host

46.949 --> 57.299
Arwen today is Wow it's amazing it's hot

52.219 --> 62.78
it's sunny and wind still so it's really

57.299 --> 62.78
freaking warm and just look at it

62.869 --> 75.119
everybody's outside doing stuff kids all

70.409 --> 82.64
over the place fooling around parents

75.119 --> 83.88
going um walk about with their kids yeah

82.64 --> 87.78
great

83.88 --> 90.95899999999999
really nice and warm yeah I actually

87.78 --> 93.03
went over to the coffee chef with what

90.959 --> 95.159
with my sweater and my jacket on because

93.03 --> 98.16
I thought that's not it's not gonna be

95.159 --> 103.77000000000001
that for but was big mistake so yeah it

98.16 --> 107.399
is that warm so much warmer than recent

103.77 --> 119.06
days so how is everybody doing let's use

107.399 --> 119.06
in chat Juan Carlos glacier Steve ajm

119.69 --> 124.64
Obama cool good to see you all

125.92 --> 129.029
[Music]

129.83 --> 138.01000000000002
Oh hm maybe you should cut down on the

136.28 --> 150.98
caps a bit there

138.01 --> 158.08999999999997
we're yeah though ace MacLeod so yeah

150.98 --> 163.13
yesterday was a blast super long hangout

158.09 --> 172.49
not record long but second longest early

163.13 --> 176.78
bird show I've done so far and was very

172.49 --> 178.46
interesting yeah I haven't watched all

176.78 --> 180.47
of it back though I'll have to do that

178.46 --> 183.05
another time

180.47 --> 186.23
was also I also appeared again on ball

183.05 --> 188.54000000000002
busters at least the first part because

186.23 --> 193.39999999999998
after a while I kind of drifted off

188.54 --> 197.32999999999998
watching Owen Benjamin and yeah that was

193.4 --> 201.08
before the panel came open but still

197.33 --> 203.15
yeah it was very interesting a good

201.08 --> 208.13000000000002
presentation and I was in a bit of a

203.15 --> 213.14000000000001
silly mood had some wine and yeah there

208.13 --> 216.53
were issues and that is that I think

213.14 --> 221.95
that the scientific presumption that

216.53 --> 226.81
light is particles units of light is a

221.95 --> 230.39
deductive based misunderstanding and

226.81 --> 233.57
yeah they all argued against me now now

230.39 --> 237.89
has been established by photonic quantum

233.57 --> 243.44
all that and I got a video and it was

237.89 --> 247.1
pretty decent explanation video but it

243.44 --> 248.989
didn't really address the core question

247.1 --> 254.29999999999998
that I presented even during the ball

248.989 --> 258.109
busters hangout and that is this quanta

254.3 --> 263.06
is Kenya

258.109 --> 264.94899999999996
is it like a unit system because from

263.06 --> 269.03000000000003
what I've seen it's like every time

264.949 --> 270.91900000000004
light registers that it registers with a

269.03 --> 274.48999999999995
minimum amount of energy and that is how

270.919 --> 278.04999999999995
they set like a measurement the units

274.49 --> 282.5
for light on - minimum register ability

278.05 --> 285.889
but I asked yeah what if there's two

282.5 --> 288.129
light particles or just a little bit

285.889 --> 293.71000000000004
more than that minimum register oh man

288.129 --> 298.43
can you have anything in between for

293.71 --> 302.56899999999996
Janna Camille an accumulation of four

298.43 --> 304.909
quantity light amounts or is it like a

302.569 --> 307.009
spectrum and there's just a minimum and

304.909 --> 311.69
you can have technically for example

307.009 --> 316.12
one-and-a-half photon energy because

311.69 --> 320.06
then then you don't have particle units

316.12 --> 322.37
then every energy amount is not a single

320.06 --> 326.569
unit it's just the minimum registerable

322.37 --> 332.99
amount so that is my point here is that

326.569 --> 337.389
light is cannot be devised in units not

332.99 --> 340.49
really not like molecules and atoms and

337.389 --> 343.61
I even have yeah some doubts with that

340.49 --> 346.40000000000003
but not gonna go there just yet I think

343.61 --> 348.289
that with light it's much more direct

346.4 --> 352.54999999999995
also because light really doesn't have

348.289 --> 354.919
any mass they know they assume it does a

352.55 --> 357.5
miniscule amount and such just with

354.919 --> 361.06899999999996
electrons through man-made devices

357.5 --> 363.68
basically so I can use that argument in

361.069 --> 365.47900000000004
this case even though I usually don't

363.68 --> 367.94
agree with it but I think it is just

365.479 --> 370.58
deduced especially with light that it is

367.94 --> 373.159
supposed to be quantified in units based

370.58 --> 380.25
on the minimum registerable amount of

373.159 --> 383.17
photonic energy so good morning to that

380.25 --> 385.15
yeah I got all that through despite

383.17 --> 391.45
being pretty damn well

385.15 --> 393.13
drunk almost I could say I should really

391.45 --> 397.53999999999996
be careful with the wine I finished the

393.13 --> 400.42
whole bottle eventually but yeah I have

397.54 --> 404.35
weighed the eveness halfway my dinner I

400.42 --> 407.47
passed out and then I ate the other half

404.35 --> 411.58000000000004
another time when I woke up it was

407.47 --> 415.78000000000003
ridiculous but still yeah this there's

411.58 --> 419.02
new concept is crystallizing and I

415.78 --> 420.90999999999997
usually do it like this I do it just

419.02 --> 422.91999999999996
like the flat earthers not have done

420.91 --> 425.74
against the ballers I just say look I

422.92 --> 430.86
have doubts about this concept can

425.74 --> 434.17
anyone definitively prove this or that

430.86 --> 436.81
when I bring up certain things nobody's

434.17 --> 440.2
thought of before like one and a half

436.81 --> 443.1
photon unit energy amounts is that

440.2 --> 445.9
possible and I'm yeah I'm just a guy

443.1 --> 449.29
sitting in this room talking on YouTube

445.9 --> 452.02
every day about sciency technical things

449.29 --> 456.34000000000003
and conceptual things and cosmology and

452.02 --> 459.64
psychology and culture social media but

456.34 --> 463.5
I hope that there are people out there

459.64 --> 469.33
that are like taking note of this and

463.5 --> 471.49
and are willing to put in their

469.33 --> 473.8
resources that they may have available

471.49 --> 478.27
to actually test it out and then get

473.8 --> 481.12
back to me with this and you know hey if

478.27 --> 484.24
you wanna say yeah of course it's it's a

481.12 --> 486.34000000000003
unit I have sources then sent me the

484.24 --> 488.73
sources and I will look through it just

486.34 --> 492.78999999999996
like wow I've looked through the video

488.73 --> 495.01
but I got a feeling about this one

492.79 --> 501.91
I think that I'm really on to something

495.01 --> 506.56
here and yeah I'm willing to delve into

501.91 --> 510.73
it deeply and basically keep stay very

506.56 --> 512.52
stubborn but yeah I just need a lot of

510.73 --> 515.49
data for that

512.52 --> 518.7289999999999
yeah I hope that other people will be

515.49 --> 525.12
honest enough with themselves to maybe

518.729 --> 527.899
question the same thing for themselves

525.12 --> 530.49
so yeah that's what I'm hoping for

527.899 --> 533.16
because yeah what I've conceptually

530.49 --> 536.73
think light is is beams it's an

533.16 --> 544.74
instantaneous connection of energy and

536.73 --> 548.7
it is it it's not quantifiable the

544.74 --> 552.089
energy that that comes from it is

548.7 --> 554.88
quantifiable but it's not matte matter

552.089 --> 558.48
wise quantifiable it's just an instant

554.88 --> 561.45
connection of energy and it just has a

558.48 --> 565.41
spectrum it has a spectrum in how it can

561.45 --> 568.8000000000001
divide even these elements like how how

565.41 --> 572.279
does light split up and then helps to

568.8 --> 576.12
have separate energy type-c all of that

572.279 --> 580.17
just leads me to believe it's not it's

576.12 --> 582.75
not solids it's not a it's not a you

580.17 --> 584.64
it's not consisting of units it's just

582.75 --> 589.079
an instantaneous connection of energy

584.64 --> 592.02
and it will press my thigh split up yeah

589.079 --> 595.38
however with what because of whatever it

592.02 --> 603.3
is confronted with it's just a

595.38 --> 608.24
mysterious force of light can wheeler

603.3 --> 608.24
yeah yeah that name keeps on popping up

609.23 --> 619.25
I think others probably have thought

614.99 --> 621.04
about it as well right Clary a visible

619.25 --> 623.779
light is a manifestation of

621.04 --> 631.99
electromagnetic radiation well maybe

623.779 --> 634.579
maybe good yeah there it does sound like

631.99 --> 636.3100000000001
familiar in a correct way I can't

634.579 --> 641.3199999999999
describe it any other way

636.31 --> 645.5
but for now I'm fascinated with yet the

641.32 --> 648.2600000000001
house the scientific community tries to

645.5 --> 653.05
resolve everything by quantifying it in

648.26 --> 657.1899999999999
units and I don't even know how

653.05 --> 663.019
electromagnetic radiation is quantified

657.19 --> 665.5600000000001
if it is I do they say it is particles

663.019 --> 669.68
in some way or is it just also an

665.56 --> 671.4499999999999
accumulation of energy because that

669.68 --> 674.18
would make sense if they at least admit

671.45 --> 676.519
that about magnetics then hey maybe

674.18 --> 683.199
light is of the same nature it does seem

676.519 --> 683.199
to not be particles similar in effect

687.45 --> 693.9200000000001
just I have a lab coat a GM as a

691.59 --> 698.07
goldsmith you do get a lab coat actually

693.92 --> 701.55
it's it's kind of dirty though and ya

698.07 --> 704.5100000000001
should get a new one but I have a lab

701.55 --> 707.51
coat I'm qualified to speak

704.51 --> 707.51
scientifically

720.16 --> 729.68
yeah I'm not gonna wear glasses no I'm

725.72 --> 734.9
very proud of my eye quality I can see

729.68 --> 735.62
very like the best eyes for anyone I've

734.9 --> 738.8199999999999
ever seen

735.62 --> 741.2
yeah I've seen now but anyone I've ever

738.82 --> 745.6400000000001
compared or tested we just have very

741.2 --> 750.5
good eyes always scored very high on the

745.64 --> 752.72
eye tests although yeah it depends on my

750.5 --> 754.37
overall condition it's just general like

752.72 --> 757.0400000000001
sometimes when I feel kind of shitty

754.37 --> 759.44
then I have trouble focusing but it

757.04 --> 762.14
seems more like that is the brain part

759.44 --> 765.4100000000001
then the actual eyes themselves my eyes

762.14 --> 770.63
are just very good very color rich very

765.41 --> 774.92
sharp and I never have any trouble

770.63 --> 780.59
focusing like complete zoom control

774.92 --> 783.92
perfectly always had it and I've trained

780.59 --> 788.96
it even to become better at it yeah

783.92 --> 794.51
to make it really good so I will not

788.96 --> 798.19
wear glasses I protest that would

794.51 --> 798.1899999999999
absolutely make me a poser

801.89 --> 806.54
yeah no glasses for me

814.31 --> 821.8499999999999
yeah yeah I was one of the lucky ones

818.54 --> 826.949
that's absolutely not colorblind in any

821.85 --> 831.4490000000001
way I think that my color side spectrum

826.949 --> 838.649
is probably way above average compared

831.449 --> 842.55
to the average male and it is told to me

838.649 --> 843.589
that it has to do with having like dark

842.55 --> 846.93
brown eyes

843.589 --> 852.47
so let me blind myself for a moment so

846.93 --> 852.4699999999999
you can see just

855.85 --> 859.2900000000001
all right can you see that

860.92 --> 867.9989999999999
yeah the yellow light sucks but yeah I

865.119 --> 871.48
very dark brown eyes and that apparently

867.999 --> 877.4390000000001
correlates with very good quality color

871.48 --> 877.439
rich eyes for some reason in general

877.859 --> 891.879
that stops caring your viewers lolz

882.129 --> 896.399
sorry about that okay boom McLouth Gator

891.879 --> 896.399
fish not mutated I certainly hope so

907.95 --> 917.76
yeah thanks for reminding me Daniel that

913.29 --> 917.76
that's still just a story

924.06 --> 939.1999999999999
how is an amount of energy directly

928.86 --> 939.2
proportional to the frequency that

943.27 --> 951.27
that sounds like another formula concept

947.97 --> 951.27
right now

954.94 --> 963.7
I think it's still a presupposition that

958.92 --> 971.7299999999999
light is consistent of photon units

963.7 --> 971.73
really little can be

983.37 --> 987.839
all right

985.71 --> 990.44
let's find hm as long as you enjoy

987.839 --> 990.44
yourself

1003.389 --> 1013.119
right so Daniel if you're gonna persist

1009.459 --> 1021.3389999999999
in that line of reasoning then explain

1013.119 --> 1023.859
to me how or rather can you as light as

1021.339 --> 1027.189
white light like a full spectrum white

1023.859 --> 1031.8990000000001
light is shown on something can you

1027.189 --> 1034.8990000000001
isolate the photonic particles of the

1031.899 --> 1041.529
different colors that the wave length

1034.899 --> 1044.4089999999999
consists of Kenya are they all separated

1041.529 --> 1048.779
micro light particles with their own

1044.409 --> 1051.94
strengths that are all conjunctive

1048.779 --> 1056.529
joined together and they're all

1051.94 --> 1063.909
separately registered because I'm gonna

1056.529 --> 1066.49
presume they're not until I see like

1063.909 --> 1068.6390000000001
pretty convincing evidence to the

1066.49 --> 1068.639
contrary

1076.47 --> 1082.15
well alright Daniel that's that's really

1079.24 --> 1084.01
nice yeah see but there you go you're

1082.15 --> 1086.14
splitting it up again and then you

1084.01 --> 1088.09
measure this with split up result that's

1086.14 --> 1092.71
very nice but I'm asking specifically

1088.09 --> 1098.1399999999999
for a nun split up registry of separate

1092.71 --> 1101.41
photon types from a single light source

1098.14 --> 1104.38
without refracting it without breaking

1101.41 --> 1108.3700000000001
it up that's what I'm asking for because

1104.38 --> 1111.3700000000001
you're presuming singular units somehow

1108.37 --> 1114.1
so if light can split up in these

1111.37 --> 1116.4699999999998
different types of units then they must

1114.1 --> 1118.3
be conjunct together with all the

1116.47 --> 1121.51
different units and there should be some

1118.3 --> 1123.99
way to register this without splitting

1121.51 --> 1123.99
it up

1135.37 --> 1142.82
all right well sounds like measuring

1139.64 --> 1146.89
photons through frequency is a deduction

1142.82 --> 1146.8899999999999
it's not really a measurement

1154.77 --> 1163.59
hello far show love right well to say

1160.92 --> 1165.27
that photons is completely [ __ ] I

1163.59 --> 1170.52
wouldn't say that although I think it

1165.27 --> 1172.74
has there has been a myth created about

1170.52 --> 1178.8
it that they are single singular

1172.74 --> 1182.58
particle units like atoms and what I

1178.8 --> 1186.6299999999999
think they are really in reality is a

1182.58 --> 1192.53
minimal registerable unit of photonic

1186.63 --> 1196.65
energy that's what I think they are not

1192.53 --> 1198.69
singular units that can be counted like

1196.65 --> 1201.75
stones like you have one stone you have

1198.69 --> 1205.14
two stone you're not gonna have in

1201.75 --> 1209.28
between amount of stone if you're just

1205.14 --> 1211.8000000000002
gonna add up these stones so if light is

1209.28 --> 1215.8799999999999
particles then you should never be able

1211.8 --> 1219.09
to register one and a half Quenton

1215.88 --> 1223.65
quantities of photonic energy in a

1219.09 --> 1226.22
single blip in a single register for

1223.65 --> 1226.22
example

1237.82 --> 1240.479
who

1244.02 --> 1254.58
I don't know I thought of it you think

1250.02 --> 1260.91
about it if you know how to dig for this

1254.58 --> 1263.85
kind of data then yeah please help me

1260.91 --> 1269.67
find out if I'm onto something here

1263.85 --> 1271.83
ha ha she'll love yeah I agree I I agree

1269.67 --> 1274.8500000000001
to that light has no speed I think it's

1271.83 --> 1278.3
an instantaneous connection

1274.85 --> 1278.3
it's a beam

1290.12 --> 1296.3799999999999
a little hello Hagrid wells good morning

1301.04 --> 1305.8899999999999
what do I need a big shovel for

1322.78 --> 1331.12
who really have you investigated the

1328.48 --> 1332.8600000000001
physics concepts for hundreds of years

1331.12 --> 1336.61
that's interesting

1332.86 --> 1340.36
I'd say you've probably investigated it

1336.61 --> 1342.1899999999998
for 20 years something more maybe I

1340.36 --> 1347.1599999999999
don't know how old you are I think

1342.19 --> 1348.94
you're very young I'd be wrong but no I

1347.16 --> 1351.22
don't think so

1348.94 --> 1354.25
I think that much of the fundamentals of

1351.22 --> 1357.16
the deeper physics particles and all

1354.25 --> 1361.02
that pretty much it really came from the

1357.16 --> 1361.02
ground in the 20th century

1369.55 --> 1372.76
[Music]

1381.22 --> 1388.94
hmm yeah yeah photo electrics are really

1386.36 --> 1397.4799999999998
cool I agree

1388.94 --> 1402.5900000000001
Oh nope no links today

1397.48 --> 1406.43
AGM I might throw in a link out there

1402.59 --> 1408.74
yeah by the way as today's I think most

1406.43 --> 1416.8400000000001
of you have registered now wait probably

1408.74 --> 1421.21
not what today I would have had a JT

1416.84 --> 1423.62
truth TV on but yeah there was a

1421.21 --> 1425.54
accidental miscommunication about the

1423.62 --> 1428.9899999999998
time and he thought it was in the

1425.54 --> 1432.08
evening like glow Buster's time and yeah

1428.99 --> 1434.86
it wasn't so he said he's gonna be on

1432.08 --> 1434.86
tomorrow instead

1438.67 --> 1445.49
hmm okay well you know what maybe I'll

1442.82 --> 1449.29
just throw out the link in public anyway

1445.49 --> 1449.29
I thought yesterday was pretty good

1451.51 --> 1456.79
so all right there we gooo

1470.44 --> 1475.5
what we'll see when somebody drops in

1487.6 --> 1490.6
right

1496.169 --> 1498.739
okay

1502.97 --> 1507.729
I think I was subscribed to him right

1509.74 --> 1512.92
[Music]

1513.02 --> 1516.18
[Applause]

1518.559 --> 1526.4189999999999
okay oh wait it's not J TJM truth TV

1524.059 --> 1526.4189999999999
sorry

1533.14 --> 1539.23
yeah I am subscribed ah man the list of

1536.83 --> 1542.59
everyone I've been subscribed to is so

1539.23 --> 1545.3700000000001
fast now it just can't even find anyone

1542.59 --> 1545.37
in there anymore

1555.59 --> 1560.82
anyway I'll put out a link for his

1558.81 --> 1563.1
channel in chat so you can take a look

1560.82 --> 1564.81
and I should be watching some of his

1563.1 --> 1567.6899999999998
videos as well he's been added for a

1564.81 --> 1572.75
very very long time I'm surprised he

1567.69 --> 1572.75
only has 520 27 subscribers really

1580.28 --> 1585.77
or maybe this is not his primary YouTube

1585.049 --> 1590.09
channel

1585.77 --> 1593.24
I thought it was very long it says this

1590.09 --> 1600.6789999999999
account of his been added in October

1593.24 --> 1602.51
18th 2016 I thought there was I thought

1600.679 --> 1604.1000000000001
it was added for a very long time I

1602.51 --> 1606.4089999999999
don't know I'll ask him tomorrow maybe

1604.1 --> 1609.1399999999999
this is just weird

1606.409 --> 1620.75
dark world confusion because I do

1609.14 --> 1622.3090000000002
remember him come on a GM can you please

1620.75 --> 1628.61
stop the Cape's it's really annoying

1622.309 --> 1634.1499999999999
just just press the caps lock again one

1628.61 --> 1634.1499999999999
time and everything will be all right

1637.159 --> 1645.7600000000002
no AGM I'm not gonna try to find a

1639.289 --> 1645.76
Christchurch hoax video thanks

1648.98 --> 1658.08
no it's not broken it's censored very

1652.35 --> 1660.99
blatantly censored anyway I have two

1658.08 --> 1664.62
original video on my computer

1660.99 --> 1667.97
I haven't even watched it yet but yeah

1664.62 --> 1667.9699999999998
from what I've heard about it

1668.42 --> 1676.89
yeah there is a lot of doubting about it

1672.15 --> 1680.18
and still have to get back with with

1676.89 --> 1682.98
Rhys about this only people can see

1680.18 --> 1686.0700000000002
basically the afterthought think what he

1682.98 --> 1689.93
has to say about it you see if he has

1686.07 --> 1689.9299999999998
any opinion about it at all

1694.04 --> 1697.6
All Right see you later Daniel

1711.82 --> 1714.4189999999999
Hey

1720.8 --> 1723.73
mmm

1732.22 --> 1739.6290000000001
that's funny Farah Shah oh four shots

1736.059 --> 1742.72
love saying the earth is a container

1739.629 --> 1747.4599999999998
it's a petri dish well who knows maybe

1742.72 --> 1753.1290000000001
the like petri dishes usually have a

1747.46 --> 1762.309
flat top they art they do tend to be

1753.129 --> 1765.82
round so who knows like I I just

1762.309 --> 1770.11
absolutely do not believe in some kind

1765.82 --> 1772.4189999999999
of literal round dome surrounding the

1770.11 --> 1775.4799999999998
physical space that would have to be a

1772.419 --> 1779.47
disk because then there would be

1775.48 --> 1783.909
different heights to reach the top to

1779.47 --> 1786.07
reach the edge the firmaments yeah if

1783.909 --> 1788.7990000000002
you go south you would bump into it a

1786.07 --> 1790.84
lot quicker than if you would try it at

1788.799 --> 1792.58
the North Pole you know that kind of

1790.84 --> 1794.74
thing and there's no indication to that

1792.58 --> 1797.289
at all it just seems to be a cap of

1794.74 --> 1804.48
height that can be reached and there's

1797.289 --> 1807.779
no no dome suggesting height

1804.48 --> 1810.779
differentials in this cap over the earth

1807.779 --> 1810.779
so

1857.41 --> 1867.3000000000002
all right okay so I have opened up the

1863.83 --> 1871.1399999999999
panel we hit the link

1867.3 --> 1871.1399999999999
nobody's joined yet

1875.72 --> 1884.71
I did write right now if I happen there

1882.44 --> 1884.71
you go

1905.91 --> 1911.8300000000002
it is kind of weird though from a lot of

1909.4 --> 1913.93
psychological perspective I am noticing

1911.83 --> 1919.3
a certain pattern about myself and that

1913.93 --> 1924.48
is that if I don't have anything in the

1919.3 --> 1931.3899999999999
system to test to doubt about then I

1924.48 --> 1934.51
don't really have a lot of angle to

1931.39 --> 1937.15
actually learn about these things and I

1934.51 --> 1939.79
really like doing it keeps me occupied

1937.15 --> 1946.96
in a way that it feels useful to me it's

1939.79 --> 1949.03
weird so it is really because of how I

1946.96 --> 1953.2
function that I keep on doing this kind

1949.03 --> 1955.69
of that [ __ ] just looking at everything

1953.2 --> 1960.97
that is said and just trying to like

1955.69 --> 1964.68
build a very quickly a vast holographic

1960.97 --> 1967.06
overview of what is discussed keeping up

1964.68 --> 1969.91
open the possibilities of what I don't

1967.06 --> 1971.9199999999998
yet understand like in a holographic

1969.91 --> 1974.38
oversight that's what I do and then I

1971.92 --> 1979.48
just find angles that nobody thinks of

1974.38 --> 1982.8100000000002
and I love to do that [ __ ] it kind of

1979.48 --> 1986.14
makes me proud that I can do that and I

1982.81 --> 1989.98
think it will be useful to to weed out

1986.14 --> 1992.6200000000001
all the all the nonsense all the all

1989.98 --> 1997.71
these stories that were all designed to

1992.62 --> 2000.51
keep people's minds on a certain real

1997.71 --> 2003.27
certain pattern predictable pattern that

2000.51 --> 2006.99
can be steered very easily because it's

2003.27 --> 2010.3799999999999
easy to oversee I think that I'm mostly

2006.99 --> 2018.77
trying to yeah unravel that and just

2010.38 --> 2018.7700000000002
make everything real again haha Mira

2026.26 --> 2042.72
[Music]

2028.86 --> 2044.28
make everything real again oh [ __ ] yeah

2042.72 --> 2047.28
you can interpret that as make earth

2044.28 --> 2057.09
around again so probably not the best

2047.28 --> 2060.66
choice of words or shorts it's like a

2057.09 --> 2066.1400000000003
nostalgic hashtag make earth round again

2060.66 --> 2066.14
come on guys what did I do

2080.41 --> 2094.5699999999997
no no I can't fix this on oh well

2091.68 --> 2101.1099999999997
there was bound to come some kind of

2094.57 --> 2104.56
glow Pro globe memes from me anyway by

2101.11 --> 2112.77
accident so I guess ashtec Mira is one

2104.56 --> 2112.77
of them let's just stick

2123.97 --> 2128.6189999999997
yeah good point guys yeah of course

2128.89 --> 2134.93
technically that is correct but maybe

2132.17 --> 2140.4500000000003
that's maybe that could be it's like a

2134.93 --> 2145.4199999999996
false hope hashtag that's funny maybe

2140.45 --> 2149.66
I'll keep it it anyway hashtag Mira make

2145.42 --> 2154.569
everything real again or make earth

2149.66 --> 2154.569
round again for the desperate lovers

2162.98 --> 2173.0
right hello whiz los weird things a

2167.3 --> 2176.7400000000002
weird a destiny patterns detected where

2173.0 --> 2179.119
seemingly one was not in other words

2176.74 --> 2181.1299999999997
there's a pattern to everything and if

2179.119 --> 2184.339
something seems like chaos to you it's

2181.13 --> 2189.67
because you're not overseeing it it's a

2184.339 --> 2189.67
lack of oversight yeah I agree

2195.55 --> 2202.2000000000003
ah that's a nice one make Earthlings

2199.78 --> 2206.86
respectful again that's cool

2202.2 --> 2209.0499999999997
see isn't it lovely what just a couple

2206.86 --> 2214.3900000000003
of letters in a certain arrangement can

2209.05 --> 2219.19
do but there is a certain element to it

2214.39 --> 2221.2799999999997
it has to somehow be a word you have to

2219.19 --> 2224.35
be able to pronounce it literally

2221.28 --> 2228.4900000000002
otherwise I was thinking like make

2224.35 --> 2231.22
science real gun but MSR eh that sounds

2228.49 --> 2234.1
more like a government agency or you

2231.22 --> 2238.83
know or a news agency you can pronounce

2234.1 --> 2238.83
it so it doesn't work then

2250.82 --> 2259.56
well I GM some of them are yeah

2255.15 --> 2263.9300000000003
etymology language is very popular in

2259.56 --> 2269.2799999999997
many circles of the Freemasonry in

2263.93 --> 2272.6099999999997
certain families like mine and yet they

2269.28 --> 2274.5
will be able to figure out memes or if

2272.61 --> 2280.23
they're into that if they even care you

2274.5 --> 2283.59
know so yeah

2280.23 --> 2286.47
some of them may work for advertising

2283.59 --> 2290.42
agencies or news agencies even in at

2286.47 --> 2290.4199999999996
that who knows

2295.67 --> 2298.67
anyway

2299.51 --> 2314.3390000000004
now not entomology etymology at least I

2311.07 --> 2323.48
think it spells that way let me double

2314.339 --> 2323.48
check it yeah

2326.02 --> 2338.25
you guys are always trying to prank me

2335.66 --> 2342.06
[Music]

2338.25 --> 2342.06
all right it's funny

2346.36 --> 2354.55
it's weird because yeah it did come up

2350.83 --> 2357.06
like with my ex - she while she is a

2354.55 --> 2362.92
dentist but she actually considered

2357.06 --> 2371.35
becoming an entomologist indeed because

2362.92 --> 2373.96
she likes bugs a lot it's really cute so

2371.35 --> 2375.52
yeah and I was into etymology and then

2373.96 --> 2379.09
the mistake comes like oh you mean

2375.52 --> 2381.4
entomology it's like a typical typical

2379.09 --> 2387.96
mistake for people to make if they know

2381.4 --> 2387.96
about entomology anyway

2391.15 --> 2397.2290000000003
I thought you had to go Daniel you're

2394.66 --> 2397.229
still here

2400.03 --> 2405.809
can't just get yourself away from me can

2403.089 --> 2405.8089999999997
you Daniel

2418.44 --> 2424.5
I don't know Daniel epistemology seems

2422.039 --> 2429.1800000000003
kind of meta to me that it's really in

2424.5 --> 2434.45
the philosophical circles and that

2429.18 --> 2438.1499999999996
requires a specific type of taste okay

2434.45 --> 2440.75
I've had a relationship before before my

2438.15 --> 2443.9100000000003
acts with somebody who is a philosopher

2440.75 --> 2444.78
officially studied that and that was

2443.91 --> 2448.14
tough [ __ ]

2444.78 --> 2451.619
okay and she said as well like yeah

2448.14 --> 2456.0
that's not philosophy what'd you do that

2451.619 --> 2458.7000000000003
is the colloquial philosophy just yeah

2456.0 --> 2461.67
thinking about figuring things out it's

2458.7 --> 2464.1299999999997
just as much philosophy as science

2461.67 --> 2466.71
generally talking about science is

2464.13 --> 2469.6800000000003
science and you have to have a specific

2466.71 --> 2472.53
taste if you want to be a real get real

2469.68 --> 2477.39
about philosophy it's not my personal

2472.53 --> 2479.6400000000003
thing really I'm I can kind of get along

2477.39 --> 2481.8289999999997
with it but it's so technical it's to me

2479.64 --> 2486.0789999999997
it's almost like judicial type of

2481.829 --> 2489.51
language it's just so specific and

2486.079 --> 2495.21
little flexibilities and so many

2489.51 --> 2498.329
registered references it's just I find

2495.21 --> 2500.4900000000002
it tedious to be fair so I'm not

2498.329 --> 2502.77
surprised that it's not a more general

2500.49 --> 2506.64
world word because there's not a lot of

2502.77 --> 2509.27
people that really like to talk in that

2506.64 --> 2509.27
type of way

2509.79 --> 2512.909
[Music]

2517.48 --> 2525.04
and I wouldn't know that if it wasn't

2521.609 --> 2529.42
epistemological claim I just know that

2525.04 --> 2535.66
that is the scientific method so I rest

2529.42 --> 2542.619
my case with that not gonna ponder upon

2535.66 --> 2545.5499999999997
the nature of why just gonna say it is

2542.619 --> 2545.55
the scientific method

2549.29 --> 2553.15
[Music]

2560.9 --> 2565.069
so guys nobody everybody is gonna hang

2564.2 --> 2569.68
out in chat

2565.069 --> 2569.68
nobody's gonna join no no panels today

2573.59 --> 2583.9900000000002
Hey Anamika in the house damn is him

2577.88 --> 2583.9900000000002
Hey hello Adam good to see you again

2607.68 --> 2616.3999999999996
All Right see you later Daniel thanks

2612.51 --> 2619.2000000000003
for bringing your questions just like

2616.4 --> 2621.48
can get a bit tedious sometimes but at

2619.2 --> 2625.2
least you are always asking questions

2621.48 --> 2628.08
and actually responding to it a response

2625.2 --> 2629.85
in some way you're not just repeating

2628.08 --> 2632.5499999999997
the same [ __ ] over and over again like

2629.85 --> 2639.12
some ballers do so I really appreciate

2632.55 --> 2640.86
you for that in my chat just as long as

2639.12 --> 2643.88
you don't spam my comment section

2640.86 --> 2647.01
because that I don't do not like so much

2643.88 --> 2648.42
but yeah a couple of comments here and

2647.01 --> 2657.3300000000004
there is not spamming so don't worry

2648.42 --> 2660.9
about it yeah

2657.33 --> 2661.8199999999997
alright well appreciate it I will I will

2660.9 --> 2665.06
keep that in mind

2661.82 --> 2665.06
see you later

2684.78 --> 2695.46
right yeah bill G yeah you're correct

2690.14 --> 2698.97
it's it's very tough to say something

2695.46 --> 2702.03
correctly if you're gonna do it within

2698.97 --> 2706.62
philosophy so it's always pointing at

2702.03 --> 2708.57
them that yeah it's very tedious you you

2706.62 --> 2710.7
have to be extremely rigid with the

2708.57 --> 2719.3700000000003
building blocks you're using in your

2710.7 --> 2721.98
language it's like another language and

2719.37 --> 2725.7599999999998
it's not my thing really although I do

2721.98 --> 2729.5
understand that the use for it but to me

2725.76 --> 2734.6600000000003
it's almost like a priesthood of words

2729.5 --> 2734.66
just too specific

2745.51 --> 2753.0400000000004
all right

2747.4 --> 2754.0
that's funny for sure love ya a a guy

2753.04 --> 2757.57
right now

2754.0 --> 2759.45
one of my neighbors he's like I think in

2757.57 --> 2767.19
his 20 somewhere and he is studying

2759.45 --> 2773.71
geography and geology right now and even

2767.19 --> 2778.2400000000002
understand like seismic data references

2773.71 --> 2781.81
and how to map out with data modeling

2778.24 --> 2784.4199999999996
with with geographical data resources

2781.81 --> 2786.52
all that stuff so yeah I I talk to him

2784.42 --> 2789.04
whenever I can because yeah he has

2786.52 --> 2790.78
really interesting information and I

2789.04 --> 2792.52
then convey some of the weirder

2790.78 --> 2797.3500000000004
conspiracy things that I talked about I

2792.52 --> 2799.75
already mentioned Flat Earth and I also

2797.35 --> 2803.71
talked about an alternative past and and

2799.75 --> 2809.35
take what tech all that and yeah he's a

2803.71 --> 2813.45
really cool open-minded guy so yeah I

2809.35 --> 2817.42
did ask him some questions also about

2813.45 --> 2821.5299999999997
yeah how do you know certainty I gave

2817.42 --> 2824.53
him the molten iron core question and he

2821.53 --> 2827.4100000000003
really by himself figured out after just

2824.53 --> 2830.82
me continuing on the question that the

2827.41 --> 2835.7799999999997
only sources he really had to go on are

2830.82 --> 2838.15
paintings and yeah deduction based

2835.78 --> 2841.8300000000004
reasoning based on presupposition that

2838.15 --> 2845.56
it must be a molten iron core somehow

2841.83 --> 2847.69
it's yeah that was really interesting

2845.56 --> 2849.7599999999998
that he would be honest about that

2847.69 --> 2856.78
eventually like uh-hmm

2849.76 --> 2860.5
right so it's good to see that some yet

2856.78 --> 2863.3700000000003
that not everybody is all neurotic about

2860.5 --> 2863.37
what they're being taught

2872.28 --> 2874.94
yeah

2884.859 --> 2895.109
yeah or glad to see that you know that

2889.63 --> 2895.109
Varsha is love indeed

2901.02 --> 2911.22
I think that geography and geology does

2906.75 --> 2915.51
have like very legitimate study

2911.22 --> 2917.6099999999997
potential for practical uses just for

2915.51 --> 2920.76
figuring out what is in the ground the

2917.61 --> 2928.19
hardness for potential construction work

2920.76 --> 2929.82
or mining you know or uncovering

2928.19 --> 2934.41
archeological things

2929.82 --> 2936.9900000000002
oh we had many functions but yeah when

2934.41 --> 2939.6
it comes to determining things about the

2936.99 --> 2943.7999999999997
earth that's when it goes into

2939.6 --> 2945.7799999999997
pseudoscience [ __ ] usually although

2943.8 --> 2949.77
yeah just a more practical down-to-earth

2945.78 --> 2951.51
things yeah they can figure out to a

2949.77 --> 2954.68
certain degree and maybe even magnetics

2951.51 --> 2958.7900000000004
I don't know but it's still a useful

2954.68 --> 2958.79
trade to study for

2967.67 --> 2977.84
dr. Jones upcoming experiments oh [ __ ] I

2975.8 --> 2980.44
think I didn't pay too much attention I

2977.84 --> 2983.48
heard it fakely but I think I just

2980.44 --> 2986.84
forgot about it was too preoccupied with

2983.48 --> 2994.58
my light not being singular units

2986.84 --> 2997.7000000000003
concept so yeah we'll see it's in a week

2994.58 --> 2999.74
right so probably be hearing hearing a

2997.7 --> 3002.2799999999997
lot about it again right before it's

2999.74 --> 3002.2799999999997
gonna happen

3034.25 --> 3040.26
all right

3036.96 --> 3045.089
cool so Roger em see if Earth's core is

3040.26 --> 3048.48
solid but there is still a molten layer

3045.089 --> 3050.19
in between the surface and the core does

3048.48 --> 3057.17
that mean that the earth is like a

3050.19 --> 3063.27
gyroscope lolz if it's gonna be free

3057.17 --> 3065.579
technically free floating in there Wow

3063.27 --> 3068.099
my god just think about it if the

3065.579 --> 3074.73
Earth's core would be solid core would

3068.099 --> 3076.8900000000003
be spinning inside of the earth like it

3074.73 --> 3081.2
would keep it rigid right like a

3076.89 --> 3084.7799999999997
gyroscope but yeah to what scale in

3081.2 --> 3090.48
comparison to the entire outer space

3084.78 --> 3093.4500000000003
universe and the galaxies like if yeah

3090.48 --> 3096.54
I'm just being really silly here with

3093.45 --> 3100.8289999999997
science fiction space [ __ ] [ __ ]

3096.54 --> 3103.38
but just think about it like planets

3100.829 --> 3107.069
supposedly spinning around Suns and Suns

3103.38 --> 3112.849
in galaxies and that's all moving right

3107.069 --> 3116.13
so what if suddenly one of these objects

3112.849 --> 3118.53
suddenly starts to form like a gyroscope

3116.13 --> 3121.8900000000003
naturally like the earth presumably and

3118.53 --> 3125.4300000000003
it starts to rotate the inside like a

3121.89 --> 3128.49
gyroscope compared to the outside would

3125.43 --> 3131.8799999999997
that suddenly cause a rigidity and it

3128.49 --> 3135.24
would fall out of its orbit maybe even

3131.88 --> 3139.099
out of its galactic orbit just think

3135.24 --> 3139.0989999999997
about it science

3153.41 --> 3157.42
man wouldn't that be hilarious

3170.23 --> 3176.77
yeah we heard the story about the

3172.69 --> 3179.89
suppose that free earth and then this

3176.77 --> 3184.69
other microbes solid planet rammed into

3179.89 --> 3187.5699999999997
earth and then the earth yeah covered it

3184.69 --> 3190.9900000000002
up and then it had earth had a solid

3187.57 --> 3195.599
core apparently is the most absurd story

3190.99 --> 3195.5989999999997
I've ever heard so

3199.53 --> 3205.3500000000004
although at least they're trying

3201.33 --> 3208.5499999999997
something to make it a little bit more

3205.35 --> 3213.93
sensible but they're using very weird

3208.55 --> 3215.9100000000003
science-fiction ancient concepts to to

3213.93 --> 3222.45
establish that then that's kinda silly

3215.91 --> 3224.8199999999997
oh you're getting timed out for that

3222.45 --> 3227.54
you're getting timed out for that that

3224.82 --> 3227.54
goes too far

3233.7 --> 3236.79
[Music]

3242.859 --> 3248.66
dammit I have no cos aw and it's the

3246.95 --> 3255.2
perfect weather for it why didn't I just

3248.66 --> 3257.21
get that huh song I'll just have to do

3255.2 --> 3260.6389999999997
with tea

3257.21 --> 3260.639
[Music]

3271.37 --> 3281.48
creators creators so yes they're

3278.69 --> 3285.02
actually Benny Ben any historical proof

3281.48 --> 3290.08
of any type of real crater forming due

3285.02 --> 3297.08
to a meteor impact that's like serious

3290.08 --> 3299.33
serious sighs yeah because I have seen

3297.08 --> 3302.48
like a lot of videos especially in

3299.33 --> 3307.58
Russia for some reason where these big

3302.48 --> 3310.4
chunks of lit up metal come apparently

3307.58 --> 3313.8199999999997
crashing down somehow and then they

3310.4 --> 3322.7200000000003
break up in an explosion but there's

3313.82 --> 3322.7200000000003
never really any meteor impact so

3325.4 --> 3332.98
you know could they just instead have

3328.4 --> 3332.98
been just giant freaking explosions

3348.77 --> 3353.78
cool overlook will you make a video

3351.21 --> 3353.78
about that

3370.98 --> 3380.37
hmm really far shoal of X how is it a

3378.49 --> 3384.8199999999997
natural phenomena

3380.37 --> 3387.67
besides that yeah it's there we see it

3384.82 --> 3390.1600000000003
it is in nature for some reason besides

3387.67 --> 3392.44
the headliner reasoning how is it

3390.16 --> 3395.23
literally a natural phenomena how did

3392.44 --> 3401.02
that come to being naturally from within

3395.23 --> 3402.97
this world that that's interesting every

3401.02 --> 3405.31
that's an interesting thought never even

3402.97 --> 3409.2
thought of that before could creators

3405.31 --> 3412.27
have come into being naturally some way

3409.2 --> 3416.1699999999996
through Earth activity without the

3412.27 --> 3422.07
impact of a giant rock come falling down

3416.17 --> 3422.07
or a giant man-made explosion somehow

3426.42 --> 3436.799
really yeah but okay that's a

3433.289 --> 3439.789
presupposition but do you really know

3436.799 --> 3446.0099999999998
how hills and mountains were made

3439.789 --> 3448.71
you know I discussed this with the with

3446.01 --> 3453.2400000000002
my neighbor too and he says like yeah

3448.71 --> 3457.14
there's like solidified magnetics that

3453.24 --> 3460.0789999999997
show like it has been compacted because

3457.14 --> 3462.93
yeah these magnetic layers have been set

3460.079 --> 3466.26
in a certain time when they were pretty

3462.93 --> 3469.049
supposedly flat originally there was a

3466.26 --> 3472.8900000000003
very interesting concept but that

3469.049 --> 3476.4
doesn't technically prove that they are

3472.89 --> 3478.92
formed by tectonic activity in actuality

3476.4 --> 3485.2200000000003
it just appears that way and there's

3478.92 --> 3489.75
data in my opinion so are you saying

3485.22 --> 3491.759
look this out yeah if you assume that it

3489.75 --> 3494.4
is tectonic activity ours tectonic

3491.759 --> 3496.38
actively gonna create circle shaped

3494.4 --> 3498.4100000000003
craters that doesn't make any sense to

3496.38 --> 3498.4100000000003
me

3502.48 --> 3511.06
oh right whis loss no sorry you can't

3507.67 --> 3513.7200000000003
put out links in chat because you're not

3511.06 --> 3517.619
wrenched I can't rent you for the moment

3513.72 --> 3517.6189999999997
if you want to put out something

3526.08 --> 3532.23
hmm right over MOOC oh but sinkholes

3529.35 --> 3536.7599999999998
have very specific different

3532.23 --> 3542.4
characteristics and meteor craters are

3536.76 --> 3545.1000000000004
not like sinkholes or I'm not at least

3542.4 --> 3555.9
some of them don't seem to be they have

3545.1 --> 3558.24
like an yet it is suggested that the

3555.9 --> 3563.01
edge of the crater would have been

3558.24 --> 3567.0899999999997
pushed into the side just as if you

3563.01 --> 3570.1800000000003
would put your foot into mud not too not

3567.09 --> 3576.1200000000003
too liquid liquefied mud it would push

3570.18 --> 3578.5499999999997
aside so that never happens with the

3576.12 --> 3580.7999999999997
sinkhole a sinkhole is always just the

3578.55 --> 3584.0600000000004
ground falling away and then eventually

3580.8 --> 3587.67
it may crumble into a more a

3584.06 --> 3591.57
trumpet-like shape but it's never gonna

3587.67 --> 3596.34
be like a crater ever doesn't have any

3591.57 --> 3598.67
up put pushed up edges right you're

3596.34 --> 3598.67
welcome

3611.41 --> 3615.42
hmm interesting

3617.07 --> 3620.9
I'll check that out for a moment

3631.68 --> 3639.5099999999998
all right that's interesting yeah I

3636.0 --> 3645.66
forgot about that the concept of Alliant

3639.51 --> 3650.3100000000004
electrical storms yeah some areas do

3645.66 --> 3652.95
definitely seem like that but are you

3650.31 --> 3658.19
saying that every single crater ever

3652.95 --> 3661.8799999999997
made is because of the electrical

3658.19 --> 3661.88
impacts all of it

3672.16 --> 3680.92
yeah I know Major Tom I just explained

3675.78 --> 3681.63
weight yeah that's what you mean sorry

3680.92 --> 3684.94
never mind

3681.63 --> 3692.07
yeah exactly craters and sinkholes are

3684.94 --> 3692.07
two different things and that's right oh

3693.9 --> 3702.63
and by the way thank you a GM for no

3697.78 --> 3702.63
longer doing caps much appreciated

3713.64 --> 3718.69
hmm-hm yeah

3715.569 --> 3719.859
those in theories are very very

3718.69 --> 3723.309
fascinating to me

3719.859 --> 3727.42
the theory that some or maybe all the

3723.309 --> 3731.8190000000004
mountains are actually petrified titans

3727.42 --> 3734.589
that just lay down or fell and then they

3731.819 --> 3737.849
became part of the landscape it's very

3734.589 --> 3740.38
fascinating and there are some serious

3737.849 --> 3743.17
suggestive formations out there that do

3740.38 --> 3750.579
give a heavy suggestion that that may be

3743.17 --> 3753.19
the case but I can say for absolutely

3750.579 --> 3760.48
100% certainty that that is the case

3753.19 --> 3765.4900000000002
though you know but certainly a

3760.48 --> 3769.92
fascinating concept and in a way I did

3765.49 --> 3772.99
even put that concept into my original

3769.92 --> 3775.1800000000003
yeah history of the world concept what

3772.99 --> 3777.3689999999997
happened like before the Classical era

3775.18 --> 3779.22
in the Atlantean age and before that the

3777.369 --> 3784.21
age of Wonders and all that and yeah

3779.22 --> 3786.6699999999996
giants I didn't mention it even

3784.21 --> 3788.98
literally like they would become part of

3786.67 --> 3794.88
the landscape but that definitely fits

3788.98 --> 3799.45
in there but yeah who knows you know

3794.88 --> 3803.319
it's so weird about concept of of the

3799.45 --> 3806.41
presumed organic being or somehow a

3803.319 --> 3808.18
being of some type yeah we presume flesh

3806.41 --> 3812.14
but maybe they were literally like

3808.18 --> 3814.6299999999997
animated stones somehow it's so

3812.14 --> 3817.089
difficult to figure out but if they have

3814.63 --> 3826.2400000000002
become mountains then there should be

3817.089 --> 3829.089
direct evidence of like giant organs in

3826.24 --> 3830.47
the way of yet the crystal formations

3829.089 --> 3832.359
that's going to be found all of that

3830.47 --> 3838.1699999999996
there should be direct signs of a

3832.359 --> 3842.14
petrified living thing see is it there

3838.17 --> 3844.69
fully is that proof absolutely there or

3842.14 --> 3846.0699999999997
is it still that all the crystals and

3844.69 --> 3849.4
all the elements

3846.07 --> 3853.29
spread out seemingly random or in a

3849.4 --> 3857.79
specific random type of pattern and not

3853.29 --> 3864.79
signs of a original petrified or critic

3857.79 --> 3868.6
a petrified type of living creature so

3864.79 --> 3870.52
yeah there is some things you have to

3868.6 --> 3874.42
really figure out before you can

3870.52 --> 3877.5099999999998
definitively make such a claim for real

3874.42 --> 3878.55
beyond just imagination but yeah

3877.51 --> 3881.55
interesting

3878.55 --> 3881.55
absolutely

3886.07 --> 3888.07
ah

3892.67 --> 3900.529
okay the land that's quite a stretch of

3897.65 --> 3903.349
a claim to claim that pebbles are organs

3900.529 --> 3906.5
because these giant Giants would have

3903.349 --> 3910.4300000000003
been gigantic so that those would have

3906.5 --> 3913.339
been pretty damn large boulders at that

3910.43 --> 3916.819
I don't think that's the case and

3913.339 --> 3919.339
besides there are even there's like

3916.819 --> 3923.5099999999998
living rock out there rock that

3919.339 --> 3926.42
naturally grows crystal has certain

3923.51 --> 3929.9300000000003
rocks and and the crystalline formations

3926.42 --> 3932.299
they yeah of minerals have lifelike

3929.93 --> 3934.91
properties they grow when they for

3932.299 --> 3937.7599999999998
example are exposed to minerals combined

3934.91 --> 3940.3999999999996
by water like from rainwater or really

3937.76 --> 3944.4100000000003
from seeping in water that's how crystal

3940.4 --> 3947.6600000000003
formations usually happen supposedly

3944.41 --> 3950.48
that's what they find in caves crystal

3947.66 --> 3955.49
case it's been leaked in and then came

3950.48 --> 3958.569
to Chris crystallize got a heat heated

3955.49 --> 3958.569
state presumably

3965.6 --> 3975.62
so now I don't think the giant pebbles

3967.85 --> 3977.8399999999997
are organs really no no of what I more

3975.62 --> 3981.65
meant was not like we will find the

3977.84 --> 3983.96
right shapes but rather find some kind

3981.65 --> 3988.31
of correlation between the type of rock

3983.96 --> 3990.95
that is found with the supposed giant

3988.31 --> 3994.25
shape so you can see like hey this is

3990.95 --> 3997.0699999999997
like this is probably has been a bone in

3994.25 --> 4001.09
a lag at some point because of the

3997.07 --> 4003.52
divisions within the specific part of

4001.09 --> 4007.2400000000002
the rock formation and then see if there

4003.52 --> 4009.97
is a different type of rock there then

4007.24 --> 4012.64
surrounding it so you can make out some

4009.97 --> 4014.7999999999997
kind of physiology a petrified

4012.64 --> 4017.7999999999997
physiology and then you get a real

4014.8 --> 4027.1600000000003
indication that it may have been a real

4017.8 --> 4029.07
living creature at some point see oh yes

4027.16 --> 4032.0699999999997
for sure

4029.07 --> 4032.07
artists

4041.48 --> 4047.38
all right and by the way for this

4043.28 --> 4054.6090000000004
concept that I'm now presenting yeah

4047.38 --> 4059.27
geology it would be extremely useful so

4054.609 --> 4062.42
yeah with scanning and everything you

4059.27 --> 4065.089
can it is possible to basically deduce

4062.42 --> 4069.2000000000003
types of material and their borders

4065.089 --> 4072.65
within the scan area so yeah that can

4069.2 --> 4076.39
actually kind of work it could be found

4072.65 --> 4076.39
in this sense

4084.299 --> 4090.449
wouldn't that be fascinating like you

4088.499 --> 4093.0789999999997
could scan a person and then see its

4090.449 --> 4096.809
skeleton and everything in there and

4093.079 --> 4098.519
that maybe at some point geologists

4096.809 --> 4100.529
could have such refined scanning

4098.519 --> 4103.2300000000005
techniques that they could literally

4100.529 --> 4107.069
just scan and mount information and just

4103.23 --> 4109.409
see the skeleton of the giant that it

4107.069 --> 4112.829000000001
was originally within there something

4109.409 --> 4126.348999999999
like that that just my fantasy is going

4112.829 --> 4126.349
well I really need some lunch

4147.75 --> 4155.19
yes Amen dad come to bring more

4150.46 --> 4155.19
subscribers thanks about for that again

4198.329 --> 4201.349
oh dear

4208.519 --> 4212.469
go ahead Simon Dan

4245.39 --> 4251.08
right is that supposed to be trick

4248.51 --> 4251.08
question

4257.7 --> 4263.71
well okay it may be a trick question but

4261.19 --> 4265.36
I presume that sea water is going to be

4263.71 --> 4268.81
denser because there's more material

4265.36 --> 4271.389999999999
dissolved in there and that typically

4268.81 --> 4273.67
may yeah salt added to water makes it

4271.39 --> 4279.88
denser that's proven on the other hand

4273.67 --> 4284.11
fresh water probably has more trouble

4279.88 --> 4288.16
being able to compress it so whatever

4284.11 --> 4290.799999999999
you're trying to suggest here I'm pretty

4288.16 --> 4293.22
sure that sea water is going to be

4290.8 --> 4293.22
denser

4302.11 --> 4308.349999999999
and you know what I think that's

4304.9 --> 4313.8099999999995
supposedly even proven when you go very

4308.35 --> 4317.89
cold regions where there are separated

4313.81 --> 4322.75
salt water layers underneath less salt

4317.89 --> 4323.410000000001
water layers like they're separated very

4322.75 --> 4326.95
weirdly

4323.41 --> 4329.0199999999995
so yeah talk about relative density at

4326.95 --> 4331.929999999999
work there but it is still a mystery to

4329.02 --> 4336.240000000001
me why doesn't interact in dilute for

4331.93 --> 4336.240000000001
some reason but yeah I've seen that

4346.13 --> 4355.07
well okay that's really fascinating

4351.53 --> 4360.11
righteous force I'll I will check it out

4355.07 --> 4364.5199999999995
is that his channel name that is really

4360.11 --> 4367.12
interesting I hope it is as good as you

4364.52 --> 4367.120000000001
make it sound

4378.78 --> 4384.429999999999
whoa 50 answers hello again my friends

4382.42 --> 4391.75
its Roger from what fossil university

4384.43 --> 4395.610000000001
with some outstanding news right thanks

4391.75 --> 4395.61
for the tip looks very interesting

4396.12 --> 4402.9
you see I said I see I recognized that

4399.46 --> 4405.64
he's also has videos about growing rocks

4402.9 --> 4408.94
so yeah I like it thanks for the tip I

4405.64 --> 4412.030000000001
will definitely check it out you know

4408.94 --> 4415.179999999999
what I'll just put it the link out here

4412.03 --> 4420.3
so everyone else can directly go to the

4415.18 --> 4420.3
channel as well cool

4435.61 --> 4442.119
so was that it Simon then is that your

4439.909 --> 4442.119
question

4452.02 --> 4455.2390000000005
[Music]

4457.729 --> 4467.030000000001
really really Simon dan are you saying

4463.88 --> 4473.4400000000005
that relative density negates the

4467.03 --> 4477.949
ability for things to dissolve in water

4473.44 --> 4480.428999999999
that is one of the dumbest things I've

4477.949 --> 4480.428999999999
ever heard

4492.679 --> 4496.54
I can't believe you actually said that

4510.31 --> 4519.67
ooh right now I think that your claim is

4516.04 --> 4522.46
really dumb and a giant hidden in plain

4519.67 --> 4531.15
sight straw man that is completely

4522.46 --> 4534.07
nonsensical I think Nathan would say it

4531.15 --> 4537.48
the most correctly and that is it is

4534.07 --> 4537.48
quite [ __ ]

4554.71 --> 4566.21
yeah that's my thought exactly Adam yeah

4560.2 --> 4568.13
that's just I don't know do you have

4566.21 --> 4572.62
that much trouble dealing with the

4568.13 --> 4572.62
concept really is it that hard

4580.06 --> 4587.240000000001
full now it's not because of the medium

4585.02 --> 4590.6900000000005
they are in necessarily although the

4587.24 --> 4596.389999999999
medium requires to be flexible in order

4590.69 --> 4599.15
for the material to find its relative

4596.39 --> 4607.46
density equilibrium point within the

4599.15 --> 4614.03
spectrum of all things so yeah it

4607.46 --> 4618.32
doesn't really matter but if the medium

4614.03 --> 4622.7
it is in is actually denser and still

4618.32 --> 4625.009999999999
leaves flexibility for motion then the

4622.7 --> 4628.0
object whatever that is with a lesser

4625.01 --> 4632.51
density in relation to the medium will

4628.0 --> 4634.46
actually move well to its relative

4632.51 --> 4637.7300000000005
density point compared to its medium

4634.46 --> 4644.06
which would in that case be let's earth

4637.73 --> 4647.9
it down upwards so yeah it's not that

4644.06 --> 4651.92
hard now it's not moving the goalposts

4647.9 --> 4659.12
this is literally what it is this is how

4651.92 --> 4662.41
it is explained every time there's no

4659.12 --> 4662.41
moving of goal posts

4664.89 --> 4672.97
and unless you were referring to

4666.9 --> 4676.079
yourself there but yeah

4672.97 --> 4676.079000000001
[Music]

4681.13 --> 4686.1990000000005
[Music]

4702.739 --> 4704.768999999999
Oh

4721.199 --> 4728.79
all right glacier well Glover's do

4724.26 --> 4733.77
actually also pick on one another so

4728.79 --> 4736.14
it's not entirely true they just all

4733.77 --> 4739.080000000001
like to collectively supposedly pick on

4736.14 --> 4744.320000000001
or they tolerate at least picking on

4739.08 --> 4744.32
flat earthers that is more a thing

4749.76 --> 4752.599
mm-hmm

4753.01 --> 4758.429
I hope you learned something today Simon

4755.979 --> 4758.429
Dan

4785.83 --> 4792.16
right she'll say you know what maybe I

4789.71 --> 4792.16
would

4795.79 --> 4804.88
but I'd be quite yeah I would make sure

4800.5 --> 4808.12
there were there were insurances like

4804.88 --> 4809.79
I'm not gonna go up there alone or yeah

4808.12 --> 4812.41
I would have to have some serious

4809.79 --> 4814.36
insurances that is not some kind of

4812.41 --> 4818.5599999999995
setup or that's not gonna freakin crash

4814.36 --> 4821.339999999999
or burn that kind of [ __ ] because

4818.56 --> 4821.34
they do that

4840.599 --> 4844.4890000000005
my GM is back on the caps

4846.59 --> 4849.76
[Music]

4855.89 --> 4859.039000000001
[Music]

4897.09 --> 4906.05
ooh toady lately all right well as I

4903.36 --> 4911.63
explained before about relative density

4906.05 --> 4915.05
it doesn't move towards the biggest mass

4911.63 --> 4917.61
it moves to its relative density

4915.05 --> 4920.58
equilibrium point in relation to all

4917.61 --> 4922.98
things not just a singular thing it's

4920.58 --> 4925.47
not like Newtonian gravity supposedly

4922.98 --> 4929.94
that it's being attracted by something

4925.47 --> 4933.77
that is denser no but it will order

4929.94 --> 4938.37
itself in the density layers and

4933.77 --> 4940.320000000001
maneuver until it can no more and ya

4938.37 --> 4942.12
find an equilibrium point within the

4940.32 --> 4946.29
spectrum of all things that's what it

4942.12 --> 4951.09
does so if you're gonna suspend any

4946.29 --> 4952.62
tower somewhere and then drop something

4951.09 --> 4956.43
underneath it it's still gonna fall

4952.62 --> 4958.83
towards the earth towards ya more mass

4956.43 --> 4962.6
because I presume in between there is

4958.83 --> 4967.67
going to be air which will be less dense

4962.6 --> 4967.67
than the thing you're dropping in there

4968.9 --> 4974.58
hey and if the tower got the chance and

4971.61 --> 4977.2699999999995
was Unleashed it would also go down and

4974.58 --> 4980.76
find its equilibrium point down there so

4977.27 --> 4982.88
anyway it's just it's not that hard come

4980.76 --> 4982.88
on

4988.429 --> 4995.2390000000005
hey yellow dust studio 68 thanks for

4992.15 --> 4997.5199999999995
popping by yesterday I had a bit of mic

4995.239 --> 4999.739
issues here and there but it's good to

4997.52 --> 5002.909000000001
see you with as part of the panel hope

4999.739 --> 5002.909
you enjoyed it

5010.9 --> 5017.75
are you literally asking the same kind

5014.72 --> 5020.860000000001
of question as the other guy did Simon

5017.75 --> 5020.86
Dan really

5046.37 --> 5052.22
I think you're a problem seems to be

5049.64 --> 5055.58
that you're too dense to get the

5052.22 --> 5059.18
concepts I'm and then sorry to tell you

5055.58 --> 5062.93
it's really basic equilibrium point is

5059.18 --> 5065.990000000001
still gonna be down there unless the

5062.93 --> 5074.51
thing you are dropping is lighter than

5065.99 --> 5085.49
the air that surrounds it and good to

5074.51 --> 5087.83
hear that Studio 68 you didn't ask a

5085.49 --> 5091.7
question Brenda I don't see any question

5087.83 --> 5093.7699999999995
mark or a phrase that could be

5091.7 --> 5095.42
interpreted as a question so I'm not

5093.77 --> 5098.05
going to answer the question because you

5095.42 --> 5098.05
didn't ask one

5105.7 --> 5112.8
okay she'll say we'll see what happens I

5109.8 --> 5112.8
dunno

5113.72 --> 5116.919
[Music]

5131.7 --> 5137.67
Brenda

5134.039 --> 5141.179
I just explained almost an exactly

5137.67 --> 5143.639
similar question right before Simon then

5141.179 --> 5145.409
did that and then I told him that it's

5143.639 --> 5149.369
stupid because it's almost exactly the

5145.409 --> 5152.308999999999
same question you can't tell me what I

5149.369 --> 5155.239
should be doing or not especially if you

5152.309 --> 5155.2390000000005
don't know what's going on

5172.35 --> 5180.1900000000005
right Simon and that is because a plane

5176.35 --> 5183.610000000001
I presume is gonna be in motion and then

5180.19 --> 5189.549999999999
aerodynamic sets in as forces because of

5183.61 --> 5192.429999999999
motion that's why it doesn't fall out of

5189.55 --> 5198.55
the sky despite its density being much

5192.43 --> 5201.39
higher than the air surrounding it it's

5198.55 --> 5201.39
not that difficult

5206.1 --> 5209.209000000001
[Music]

5219.38 --> 5223.42
and

5221.32 --> 5226.179999999999
all right mastermind I kinda have to

5223.42 --> 5228.28
agree and don't even mean this is like

5226.18 --> 5231.52
some kind of at home but it really does

5228.28 --> 5235.57
sound like a ten-year-old question it's

5231.52 --> 5244.870000000001
just can't you come up with something

5235.57 --> 5253.42
better than that really what are you

5244.87 --> 5256.98
serious my god ah you did it again your

5253.42 --> 5256.9800000000005
stupidity is giving me a headache

5271.15 --> 5275.49
I can't believe you guys are that stupid

5281.4 --> 5287.73
you're both of you are Brenda and Simon

5285.93 --> 5289.9800000000005
then you're straw Manning me with the

5287.73 --> 5292.65
most ridiculous assumption about how

5289.98 --> 5296.15
relative density is supposedly working

5292.65 --> 5300.0
because you obviously don't get it

5296.15 --> 5301.589999999999
despite the hundreds of explanations

5300.0 --> 5303.81
you've gotten from several different

5301.59 --> 5306.900000000001
people that are pretty damn consistent

5303.81 --> 5309.240000000001
or at least consistent enough and you

5306.9 --> 5310.98
still don't get it and just because you

5309.24 --> 5312.929999999999
don't get it doesn't mean that you can

5310.98 --> 5315.33
make up this ridiculous straw man

5312.93 --> 5318.240000000001
assumption about it and then claim that

5315.33 --> 5321.0599999999995
that disproves it that's just [ __ ]

5318.24 --> 5323.45
that it's really freaking dumb and

5321.06 --> 5323.450000000001
annoying

5343.34 --> 5354.81
no I'm not getting mad I am getting

5347.46 --> 5358.71
annoyed just you know it's just true

5354.81 --> 5360.900000000001
stupidity is really annoying to me when

5358.71 --> 5365.27
I see that it's not because they're just

5360.9 --> 5371.7
being maybe they are

5365.27 --> 5376.2300000000005
it seems genuine stupidity or a [ __ ]

5371.7 --> 5378.21
fit that they're having then Brenda

5376.23 --> 5380.49
seems especially vulnerable to that

5378.21 --> 5382.44
state of mind and I think Simon then

5380.49 --> 5384.84
also has the capacity for it as

5382.44 --> 5388.889999999999
irregularly asks really freaking dumb

5384.84 --> 5393.860000000001
questions and makes outrageous

5388.89 --> 5393.860000000001
outrageous straw man arguments

5404.82 --> 5409.469999999999
[Music]

5413.659 --> 5421.58
all right you need my answer doesn't

5417.409 --> 5427.009999999999
fall off cause the air that surrounds it

5421.58 --> 5429.32
is lower in density than the plane and

5427.01 --> 5432.56
when it stops moving there is no more

5429.32 --> 5434.389
force that thanks to the aerodynamics of

5432.56 --> 5437.21
the plane's design we'll keep it up

5434.389 --> 5439.909000000001
there despite its higher density than

5437.21 --> 5440.4800000000005
the air surrounding it so will it fall

5439.909 --> 5442.989
down

5440.48 --> 5446.209999999999
to find an equilibrium point and

5442.989 --> 5449.36
basically fall down until it yeah can no

5446.21 --> 5451.94
longer move that downward because

5449.36 --> 5454.04
downward is gonna be definitely it's

5451.94 --> 5459.98
equilibrium point because that is where

5454.04 --> 5464.57
the solids are which are denser than the

5459.98 --> 5470.48
air just like the airplane it's not that

5464.57 --> 5476.03
hard because that is where it is that's

5470.48 --> 5483.61
why down knowing since yours don't it's

5476.03 --> 5483.61
time for you to go idiots sick of you

5485.8 --> 5490.27
and YouTube

5495.38 --> 5504.21
I'm done just I don't want to explain

5500.76 --> 5508.79
this super easy [ __ ] over again I'm

5504.21 --> 5511.11
not a freaking kindergarten teacher okay

5508.79 --> 5513.81
if you can't get it through your head

5511.11 --> 5515.969
then just piss off I'm not gonna keep on

5513.81 --> 5518.27
explaining the same [ __ ] over and

5515.969 --> 5521.58
over again just because you don't get it

5518.27 --> 5523.77
it's how it works it's very easily

5521.58 --> 5528.23
explained if you don't get it it's

5523.77 --> 5528.2300000000005
because you're a [ __ ] now piss off

5537.01 --> 5547.68
Oh God uh yeah Nathan you can do that

5543.81 --> 5547.68
you just scare him away

5547.92 --> 5553.66
gets very scared when people start to

5551.62 --> 5555.46
ask him questions I don't even want to

5553.66 --> 5561.4
because I know he'll never answer them

5555.46 --> 5566.44
and I'm just sick off the red herrings I

5561.4 --> 5572.259999999999
don't like fish okay don't like the

5566.44 --> 5574.719999999999
smell of it and I don't like to be like

5572.26 --> 5585.67
to have fish shoved in my face every

5574.72 --> 5588.1
time I ask a damn question yeah well

5585.67 --> 5602.25
this Welsh fish slapping is just not my

5588.1 --> 5602.25
thing nice Nathan Oakley

5614.519 --> 5617.519
right

5634.37 --> 5638.84
so I hope they piss off

5650.34 --> 5658.33
right for show us love nothing subs

5653.95 --> 5663.04
prove that there is a lot of attention

5658.33 --> 5664.9
um a person either because they have a

5663.04 --> 5668.98
lot of followers or because there is

5664.9 --> 5673.54
corporate interest one way or the other

5668.98 --> 5683.23
so that's what it proves that there is

5673.54 --> 5685.57
interest of some kind and I thank

5683.23 --> 5689.259999999999
everyone that has subscribed to my

5685.57 --> 5693.509999999999
channel for subscribing and I hope you

5689.26 --> 5693.51
find my daily show interesting enough

5693.6 --> 5701.68
what link now I'm not gonna open the

5698.59 --> 5703.6
panel anymore at this time sorry I think

5701.68 --> 5708.79
I'm gonna run out the show and not too

5703.6 --> 5713.280000000001
long so I'm certainly not in the mood to

5708.79 --> 5716.47
entertain Brenda and Simon Dan you know

5713.28 --> 5718.78
if that was the case yeah if I'd ever

5716.47 --> 5722.47
consider that they pretty much had to

5718.78 --> 5724.87
arrive at the start of the show and then

5722.47 --> 5729.030000000001
maybe I'll get them in but yeah not

5724.87 --> 5732.34
afterwards when I've already yeah

5729.03 --> 5734.82
talked about a lot of stuff and kind of

5732.34 --> 5734.82
need lunch

5735.73 --> 5744.78
I don't want to be in a weakened state

5739.3 --> 5744.78
when I'm confronted with these deviance

5750.12 --> 5756.39
so sorry to disappoint you maybe

5752.44 --> 5767.11
tomorrow oh wait now tomorrow's gonna be

5756.39 --> 5771.22
JT truth TV hmm but yeah we'll see maybe

5767.11 --> 5774.42
Tuesday or yeah we'll see you'll get

5771.22 --> 5774.42
your chance to get on here

5776.65 --> 5785.2
and yeah hey Nathan if Simon if I ever

5781.03 --> 5787.66
let Simon Dan and Brendan I I will

5785.2 --> 5793.53
probably at at some point pop you

5787.66 --> 5797.2
willing as well basically finish him off

5793.53 --> 5799.15
I personally don't really like doing

5797.2 --> 5801.54
that but I do really appreciate you

5799.15 --> 5801.54
doing that

5805.36 --> 5818.329
hmm so thanks everyone for coming and if

5814.19 --> 5822.228999999999
you like the video then please upload it

5818.329 --> 5825.228999999999
and if you're a troll downloaded or yeah

5822.229 --> 5829.610000000001
seems to have a lot of downloads these

5825.229 --> 5832.55
days very persistently so it's like a

5829.61 --> 5835.848999999999
consensus that Arwen is bad apparently

5832.55 --> 5838.099
according to a lot of people they need

5835.849 --> 5841.610000000001
to remind me every day that I have

5838.099 --> 5844.55
trolls so thanks but anyway yeah I vote

5841.61 --> 5848.989
is still a vote so I don't really mind

5844.55 --> 5853.400000000001
any vote will register as yeah as

5848.989 --> 5854.928999999999
attention so that's good and yeah if you

5853.4 --> 5857.21
haven't subscribed to my channel already

5854.929 --> 5858.71
then please do so and hit the bell

5857.21 --> 5862.01
notification so you know when I'm going

5858.71 --> 5863.719
live which is usually 2 p.m. Amsterdam

5862.01 --> 5866.119000000001
time but sometimes I start a little bit

5863.719 --> 5869.539
early and sometimes a little bit late

5866.119 --> 5871.848999999999
and yeah if if I'm early then having the

5869.539 --> 5877.009999999999
bell hit it's the only way to know or

5871.849 --> 5881.09
you're gonna be late so yeah I will be

5877.01 --> 5883.280000000001
back tomorrow early 1 o'clock p.m.

5881.09 --> 5884.929
Amsterdam time I'm gonna try maybe I'll

5883.28 --> 5888.978999999999
be a little bit late and it'll turn out

5884.929 --> 5892.76
to be half past 1 we'll see and

5888.979 --> 5895.4890000000005
hopefully I will be getting a j JT TV

5892.76 --> 5897.9490000000005
truth TV on as well as a special guest

5895.489 --> 5901.4
will be cool

5897.949 --> 5903.799999999999
yeah it also should ask this

5901.4 --> 5905.268999999999
I should probably even do this thing in

5903.8 --> 5907.4890000000005
front of the show but I don't know I

5905.269 --> 5908.900000000001
don't really feel like it I just want to

5907.489 --> 5910.218999999999
get into the material as much as

5908.9 --> 5913.699
possible and the weather report of

5910.219 --> 5918.229
course but yeah please do financially

5913.699 --> 5921.678999999999
support me in my efforts I really need

5918.229 --> 5924.1990000000005
it I kind of have to get some level of

5921.679 --> 5926.36
support otherwise it just it's not gonna

5924.199 --> 5929.178999999999
nothing's gonna happen them I will have

5926.36 --> 5932.598999999999
this mic at least but yeah it's not

5929.179 --> 5935.49
gonna move beyond that really by itself

5932.599 --> 5939.42
without financial support from

5935.49 --> 5941.82
from my loyal viewers so please at some

5939.42 --> 5944.22
time help me out there and donate some

5941.82 --> 5946.88
superjet I got a big super chat donation

5944.22 --> 5950.97
yesterday is a very very happy with that

5946.88 --> 5954.71
I haven't had any PayPal activity for a

5950.97 --> 5957.2
while but yeah we'll see where it goes

5954.71 --> 5964.62
of course I have to present something

5957.2 --> 5967.67
for it so I hope that my yeah my lights

5964.62 --> 5971.63
not being a particle concept is

5967.67 --> 5974.79
interesting enough to spare something I

5971.63 --> 5977.82
will be working on that and digging

5974.79 --> 5984.48
through new material to confirm or

5977.82 --> 5988.98
disconfirm the concept and oh thanks

5984.48 --> 5993.03
Nathan for the 79 pence super chat

5988.98 --> 5993.709999999999
donation much appreciated every little
