[Music]

62.539 --> 67.76
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

83.52 --> 87.42

the support so please keep it coming

98.22 --> 102.53999999999999
right

100.14 --> 106.46000000000001
so yeah the weather today is

102.54 --> 106.46000000000001
pretty much identical to yesterday

106.86 --> 114.06
perhaps a bit more windy

109.56 --> 117.119
but it's just been clouded all the time

114.06 --> 120.60000000000001
and raining sometimes

117.119 --> 123.32
to reinstall my plants

120.6 --> 123.32
between

124.079 --> 128.34
the gate

126.69 --> 131.119
[Music]

128.34 --> 131.119
barrier

132.84 --> 135.78
because otherwise they blow all over the

134.64 --> 137.02999999999997
place

135.78 --> 140.069
right

137.03 --> 140.069
[Music]

142.739 --> 145.58
so

150.84 --> 153.31900000000002
so yeah

153.42 --> 155.48
yeah

157.319 --> 163.33999999999997
not riveting weather

160.44 --> 163.34
but I will

163.879 --> 170.48
fluffy snow first in chat Richard G

167.58 --> 170.48000000000002
good to see you

171.0 --> 176.76
it is Sunday the 23rd of July 2023

177.42 --> 180.98
let's check the temperature

186.0 --> 189.8
90 degrees Celsius right

190.68 --> 195.31900000000002
still not super cold or anything but

198.18 --> 204.36
it's not really comfortable like in

201.9 --> 207.3
shorts it's like this

204.36 --> 210.31900000000002
I really do miss the sunny summer part I

207.3 --> 210.31900000000002
really hope it comes back

210.84 --> 214.379
but from the forecast it seems like it's

213.0 --> 217.34
going to be kind of like this weather

214.379 --> 217.34
for a week or so

217.56 --> 221.12
let's hope that changes

221.459 --> 227.53900000000002
right

222.03 --> 227.539
[Music]

230.879 --> 233.959
how are you guys doing

237.36 --> 245.64000000000001
yesterday was a busy day

241.22 --> 249.379
ball busters like lasted forever

245.64 --> 249.379
was very long show

251.04 --> 257.699
and on top of that yeah I kind of dueled

254.76 --> 260.699
a bit because oh Benjamin Had An

257.699 --> 262.5
Unexpected Saturday live stream with

260.699 --> 264.479
Vivian Kubrick

262.5 --> 266.04
I didn't realize it was going to be on a

264.479 --> 269.4
Saturday

266.04 --> 273.97900000000004
but yeah that also lasted unbelievably

269.4 --> 273.979
long like three and a half hours

274.919 --> 279.71999999999997
but it was required though because I

277.38 --> 282.36
mean Vivian really did have require a

279.72 --> 285.3
lot of time to get into it

282.36 --> 289.44
it's a little bit Skitty

285.3 --> 289.44
bit nervous recognizable

291.66 --> 297.90000000000003
but yeah very esoteric talker

295.259 --> 300.90000000000003
bit hippie dippy like it is

297.9 --> 302.88
that's like where it's coming from a bit

300.9 --> 305.28
like she had her own mechanical language

302.88 --> 307.32
and had more hippier Roots within it

305.28 --> 310.38
it's funny but still effective enough

307.32 --> 313.02
but yeah

310.38 --> 315.65999999999997
made a pretty good case about why her

313.02 --> 317.52
father what didn't fake the moon landing

315.66 --> 318.47900000000004
because if he had it would have been

317.52 --> 321.74
better

318.479 --> 321.74
and that made sense

322.02 --> 326.15999999999997
because it was like a neurotic

323.88 --> 328.919
perfectionist

326.16 --> 330.78000000000003
with his art and all that and he would

328.919 --> 334.02
have never agreed to it it's probably

330.78 --> 335.58
even what I personally think

334.02 --> 338.58
about it is that it would have been

335.58 --> 339.84
logical that they basically tried to get

338.58 --> 342.479
him in

339.84 --> 345.59999999999997
but they eventually only used him for an

342.479 --> 347.82
advisory role because he wasn't regarded

345.6 --> 350.639
as trusted

347.82 --> 352.5
in on the full project like that even

350.639 --> 354.66
though he probably already figured out

352.5 --> 357.86
that that is what they were doing

354.66 --> 357.86
because he's that smart

358.02 --> 362.15999999999997
so that's probably what happened they

360.0 --> 365.46
kind of like oh hey if you wanted to

362.16 --> 367.91900000000004
film it what would you do

365.46 --> 370.75899999999996
right but they didn't actually say that

367.919 --> 370.75899999999996
they were doing it

371.4 --> 377.15999999999997
like was Kept Secret so

374.18 --> 379.259
right it was an interesting video it

377.16 --> 382.88000000000005
lasted very long

379.259 --> 382.88
so it was a bit of a late night

388.319 --> 392.819
and yeah this morning I was watching

390.78 --> 395.15999999999997
Paul Cook had all kinds of videos and

392.819 --> 397.68
mine onville had a video

395.16 --> 399.96000000000004
another freaky video but this one was

397.68 --> 402.06
really [ __ ] up

399.96 --> 404.4
but how there was originally in the

402.06 --> 406.74
medieval times there was apparently like

404.4 --> 410.09999999999997
a habit of

406.74 --> 412.44
like taking lost children and freaking

410.1 --> 413.639
mutating them deforming them really

412.44 --> 416.46
[ __ ] up

413.639 --> 420.72
was made illegal by King Richard upon

416.46 --> 420.71999999999997
penalty of death though but

421.979 --> 428.479
yeah mine and Phil they always get the

425.46 --> 428.479
freakiest stuff

429.36 --> 433.38
and Paul Cook

430.979 --> 437.28
did a piece like unexpected on

433.38 --> 438.36
antiquotec electrical antiquotec and he

437.28 --> 441.71999999999997
made a

438.36 --> 444.0
pretty interesting video about that so

441.72 --> 446.52000000000004
if you're interested in antiquotec

444.0 --> 447.419
should check that video out from Paul

446.52 --> 450.18
Cook

447.419 --> 452.21999999999997
I literally just watched it before I

450.18 --> 454.139
started my show

452.22 --> 459.41900000000004
actually didn't get to finish the last

454.139 --> 459.419
few minutes but it was very concentrated

460.44 --> 463.94
and very fascinating

465.3 --> 470.84000000000003
his ideas about it

467.4 --> 470.84
then you link it yeah sure

478.919 --> 481.639
there it is

486.78 --> 491.78
it's a 25 26 minute video

499.02 --> 504.0
oh wait this is the link to the Paul

501.12 --> 505.319
Cook video yeah that might unveiled you

504.0 --> 507.419
just got to be subscribed to mine

505.319 --> 511.16
unveiled and then to go to mine unveiled

507.419 --> 511.15999999999997
Channel and just watch the latest video

516.0 --> 521.52
right it didn't go in yeah it just I

519.719 --> 523.62
mean mine on Phil didn't like there's no

521.52 --> 525.06
instruction videos on how to [ __ ] them

523.62 --> 527.76
up or anything

525.06 --> 531.4799999999999
like what they exactly did

527.76 --> 533.58
it's just folklore

531.48 --> 535.5
now in different places this sort of

533.58 --> 537.12
thing what like that it was considered

535.5 --> 540.48
like a dark art

537.12 --> 543.92
by certain people to be able to do that

540.48 --> 543.9200000000001
it's pretty freaky

545.82 --> 551.9590000000001
and like I believe it

548.76 --> 551.959
like yeah

566.88 --> 573.019
a lost art of bonsai children oh my

570.36 --> 573.019
cover name

573.959 --> 579.4799999999999
did you want that one Richard G

576.72 --> 581.399
or Paul Cook one

579.48 --> 584.94
because that's the one I posted Paul

581.399 --> 587.24
books video that I just watched hey LSG

584.94 --> 587.24
anyway

588.72 --> 595.26
what all right you already got that one

593.16 --> 597.019
right okay yeah that's the one I posted

595.26 --> 600.74
okay

597.019 --> 600.74
306 could see you

600.82 --> 604.0390000000001
[Music]

607.17 --> 610.309
[Music]

623.16 --> 627.4399999999999
all right anybody watch ball buses

625.2 --> 627.44
yesterday

628.019 --> 632.4590000000001
it was kind of funny because what Brian

630.36 --> 635.4590000000001
basically did I talked to him afterward

632.459 --> 638.04
afterward everybody was gone

635.459 --> 639.92
over uh

638.04 --> 643.0799999999999
Discord

639.92 --> 646.86
but it's like

643.08 --> 650.339
the very first presentation he Brian

646.86 --> 653.64
ever did Ryan's logic ever did on

650.339 --> 656.22
fed when he came on as like an

653.64 --> 657.899
introduction to everybody was literally

656.22 --> 659.4590000000001
about what he was talking about

657.899 --> 662.339
yesterday

659.459 --> 666.3599999999999
it's so funny like he mentioned about

662.339 --> 670.98
that in that presentation about how

666.36 --> 676.22
GPS uses a Cartesian coordination system

670.98 --> 676.22
which literally means it is a flat plane

676.88 --> 683.3389999999999
that they use flat plane based data

680.279 --> 685.92
it's so funny because I remember that

683.339 --> 688.86
I'm actually kind of proud of even

685.92 --> 691.019
though I don't feel like I have like

688.86 --> 694.26
Choice based control of it I do feel

691.019 --> 696.9590000000001
proud that I actually remember that

694.26 --> 699.06
it's like hey Ryan didn't you

696.959 --> 700.3199999999999
didn't you do that

699.06 --> 702.54
like

700.32 --> 704.339
weren't you talking about that like when

702.54 --> 707.12
I just first got to know it's like one

704.339 --> 709.5600000000001
of the first memories I have of you

707.12 --> 711.12
is saying that

709.56 --> 713.06
so funny

711.12 --> 715.26
and back then everybody just kind of

713.06 --> 716.8199999999999
slipped by it

715.26 --> 718.74
when he was saying that because it was

716.82 --> 720.24
like in the middle of the Black Swan and

718.74 --> 723.12
all that and there were so many

720.24 --> 726.0600000000001
developments that it was like

723.12 --> 727.86
too out of the way to get to that with

726.06 --> 730.4399999999999
everybody's attention but now

727.86 --> 732.36
everybody's all steamed ready it's like

730.44 --> 734.82
yeah everything has been digested

732.36 --> 738.98
properly there's room for something dig

734.82 --> 738.98
well this is something big so here we go

741.36 --> 743.36
um

749.1 --> 753.6800000000001
man

750.24 --> 753.6800000000001
let me hit the Fleming today

759.18 --> 763.579
I feel pretty good though

761.04 --> 763.579
it's all that

766.44 --> 771.6600000000001
but also I feel the calling like I

769.019 --> 774.44
really need me to like just make a big

771.66 --> 774.4399999999999
dinner thing

774.6 --> 777.2
because

778.079 --> 784.079
I've like not done that for so long now

781.98 --> 786.8000000000001
it's been like two months it's not good

784.079 --> 790.2199999999999
I mean I do still like eat chicken

786.8 --> 790.2199999999999
broccoli and

792.779 --> 798.3
actually ate steak one time at least

796.2 --> 801.38
but it's just like that's still a pretty

798.3 --> 801.38
small meals

801.54 --> 806.459
I really need to make something bigger

803.519 --> 808.8
because like my body is just saying like

806.459 --> 809.76
yeah I mean we've been barely holding

808.8 --> 812.579
out

809.76 --> 814.5
but well enough but I mean you need to

812.579 --> 817.7399999999999
restock like those

814.5 --> 820.7
Trace substances we really only get from

817.74 --> 820.7
like the fresh food

820.86 --> 824.5790000000001
besides lettuce because I have been

822.899 --> 827.3
eating lots of lettuce and it has been

824.579 --> 827.3
doing a lot of good

828.42 --> 833.279
right that includes rukula although not

831.06 --> 837.0
rokule recently

833.279 --> 839.76
did I miss something yesterday well

837.0 --> 842.54
ball busters did you miss bobas just

839.76 --> 842.54
yesterday Terry

843.12 --> 849.12
I mean during the day there was not

846.54 --> 852.26
a whole lot

849.12 --> 852.26
after my show

852.54 --> 857.88
but yeah then there was ball busters and

855.0 --> 860.279
and on top of that is a bonus live

857.88 --> 862.32
stream from Owen Benjamin that I watched

860.279 --> 864.54
on D live these days because I can't

862.32 --> 868.139
seem to like

864.54 --> 870.8389999999999
the credit card from my bank is blocked

868.139 --> 873.9590000000001
is blocking it or something

870.839 --> 875.639
subscribing to unauthorized.tv so it

873.959 --> 878.16
literally can't so unless somebody's

875.639 --> 882.24
willing to

878.16 --> 884.16
basically lend me their credit card data

882.24 --> 887.399
or something

884.16 --> 889.86
like I I can't seem to get in it which

887.399 --> 892.76
is kind of a shame because this is the

889.86 --> 892.76
unleash of niggle

893.82 --> 896.9590000000001
oh well

898.26 --> 902.04
you're interested in seeing Owen's

900.06 --> 904.56
stream okay well watch it on bit shoot

902.04 --> 906.68
then I guess I'll be the link up guy

904.56 --> 909.66
today

906.68 --> 912.3199999999999
[Music]

909.66 --> 912.3199999999999
why not

921.56 --> 926.16
right so here's that stream from own

924.839 --> 929.5400000000001
Benjamin

926.16 --> 929.54
it's a very long stream

940.51 --> 945.06
[Music]

942.959 --> 947.4799999999999
just some Ryan's presentation ah right

945.06 --> 947.4799999999999
cool

952.56 --> 960.6199999999999
yes there it

955.44 --> 960.62
I mean it's like on the front picture

961.13 --> 966.289
[Music]

993.36 --> 998.4590000000001
yeah and by the way Owen did like an

995.579 --> 1001.519
amazing job basically guiding her

998.459 --> 1005.06
because she did seem a little fragile

1001.519 --> 1006.98
especially at the start

1005.06 --> 1008.5999999999999
and like

1006.98 --> 1010.339
he did great

1008.6 --> 1012.259
like I don't think I would have been

1010.339 --> 1015.0790000000001
that good like I would have probably

1012.259 --> 1016.6990000000001
like hit a nerve at some point if I

1015.079 --> 1020.8
would be talking to her

1016.699 --> 1020.8
because I guess I do that sort of thing

1021.23 --> 1027.02
[Music]

1024.319 --> 1030.26
get very to the point

1027.02 --> 1033.86
like too much to the point and like

1030.26 --> 1035.24
get involved in people's personality

1033.86 --> 1037.819
like

1035.24 --> 1039.439
which some people really don't like that

1037.819 --> 1041.36
when you do that

1039.439 --> 1044.38
but for me it's like

1041.36 --> 1044.3799999999999
it's kind of a habit

1046.52 --> 1050.78
yeah

1048.86 --> 1053.5
but she still had a lot of interesting

1050.78 --> 1053.5
things to say

1053.9 --> 1059.179
and she was like very well aware of like

1056.66 --> 1060.8600000000001
the alternative yeah of Germany medicine

1059.179 --> 1062.72
and

1060.86 --> 1065.24
and all that sort of thing so that's

1062.72 --> 1067.16
like great

1065.24 --> 1070.64
very well aware

1067.16 --> 1073.039
so yeah in that sense like feels like oh

1070.64 --> 1077.0200000000002
another one we got another one

1073.039 --> 1077.02
I can really see very wide

um

1085.78 --> 1089.01
[Music]

1106.88 --> 1109.48
what

1110.62 --> 1118.039
up it says

1113.679 --> 1121.1000000000001
oh yeah yeah his Wiki is all [ __ ]

1118.039 --> 1124.7
except happy I mean

1121.1 --> 1127.4599999999998
it was basically ejected by by Hollywood

1124.7 --> 1129.98
and the Machine like that so yeah they

1127.46 --> 1132.02
got a pretty they [ __ ] him over I mean

1129.98 --> 1134.419
it's the same thing with a lot of those

1132.02 --> 1137.36
types of people that

1134.419 --> 1139.0
like Alex Jones in his own way has that

1137.36 --> 1140.84
has had that done

1139.0 --> 1145.039
to him

1140.84 --> 1147.98
and but yeah Owens really got it like I

1145.039 --> 1151.52
mean they do it to the flat earthers

1147.98 --> 1155.02
that are prominent as well and like yeah

1151.52 --> 1155.02
doesn't really mean anything

1156.14 --> 1164.26
I just like to listen to them

1159.74 --> 1164.26
and not read about them

1164.36 --> 1170.86
you know what's up baby

1166.88 --> 1170.8600000000001
anyway hello Mark Collard by the way

1185.539 --> 1190.64
I'll Google and Wiki change over yeah

1188.72 --> 1193.34
you mean how they were brutally

1190.64 --> 1197.3600000000001
politicized

1193.34 --> 1198.98
and vulcified yeah accept happy

1197.36 --> 1201.4399999999998
I mean

1198.98 --> 1203.419
it's not a new thing I mean it's just

1201.44 --> 1207.039
everything open machine is just getting

1203.419 --> 1207.039
poisoned right it's just

1207.5 --> 1212.6
putting out its poisoned skin basically

1209.96 --> 1216.32
it was always there being built and now

1212.6 --> 1219.02
it's just unleashed the [ __ ] up

1216.32 --> 1223.3999999999999
woke [ __ ]

1219.02 --> 1225.2
and politicizing power game

1223.4 --> 1227.66
playing favorites

1225.2 --> 1231.28
right that sort of yeah that's that's

1227.66 --> 1231.28
what they Unleashed on all of it

1231.44 --> 1235.24
I mean there's nothing you can do about

1232.94 --> 1235.24
it

1239.84 --> 1244.6599999999999
I just not give it too much attention

1245.96 --> 1251.3600000000001
like they're do just realize that

1248.72 --> 1254.24
they're doing it to try to influence you

1251.36 --> 1257.24
yeah like a peon or an animal

1254.24 --> 1259.76
so don't let it influence you like in

1257.24 --> 1263.1200000000001
any way don't let it

1259.76 --> 1266.6
change your mind don't let it opinionate

1263.12 --> 1268.1599999999999
you and definitely don't let it distract

1266.6 --> 1271.28
you or

1268.16 --> 1273.98
pull you away from a good thing that you

1271.28 --> 1276.5
were doing or a flow that you were in

1273.98 --> 1278.78
right so just don't let it disturb you

1276.5 --> 1283.72
and you win

1278.78 --> 1283.72
yeah that's how most of this woke works

1286.82 --> 1292.9399999999998
like keep it away from your children

1290.24 --> 1295.76
and don't let it disturb you just

1292.94 --> 1296.52
let them do their stupid [ __ ] on their

1318.919 --> 1322.8400000000001

1323.24 --> 1326.559
what did he think about it

1329.12 --> 1335.1399999999999
you your friend who you invited to

1332.059 --> 1335.1399999999999
listen to ball busters

1342.28 --> 1348.32
by the way

1345.38 --> 1351.7600000000002
holding that off for too much

1348.32 --> 1351.76

1407.24 --> 1411.98
that's that's been a long time since

1410.12 --> 1415.58
that happened

1411.98 --> 1415.58
freaking tea

1416.179 --> 1422.0800000000002
glass falling over damn it I hate it

1419.6 --> 1425.6789999999999
when it happens

1422.08 --> 1425.6789999999999
so messy

1428.32 --> 1445.319
[Music]

1463.58 --> 1465.75

all right

1465.75 --> 1471.869
[Music]

1483.159 --> 1486.7
that'll have to do

1489.08 --> 1494.02
a little slow mo buggy

1491.24 --> 1494.02
see you

1499.34 --> 1503.62
he was overwhelmed right

1504.62 --> 1508.6999999999998
overwhelmed but he did realize that it's

1506.96 --> 1510.74
real

1508.7 --> 1512.419
that we're not fooling around

1510.74 --> 1514.7
yeah that's correct that's great that's

1512.419 --> 1518.729
the best response you can get

1514.7 --> 1518.729

1524.179 --> 1529.5800000000002
for an hour or two after wow awesome

1526.84 --> 1532.9599999999998
sounds like somebody just kind of woke

1529.58 --> 1532.96
up to Flat Earth for real

1533.779 --> 1538.4
but just as a distant curiosity

1537.02 --> 1539.87
cool man

1538.4 --> 1544.0300000000002
well done

1539.87 --> 1544.03
[Music]

1551.919 --> 1557.1200000000001
ah yeah the Dave Murphy interview yeah

1555.14 --> 1560.3600000000001
but that thing was so impressive though

1557.12 --> 1564.08
David I mean I wasn't like convinced but

1560.36 --> 1567.9189999999999
it definitely like pulled me over a bit

1564.08 --> 1570.26
because he was just so freaking calm and

1567.919 --> 1573.3200000000002
reserved and

1570.26 --> 1575.5
Pleasant about it and it was on TV it's

1573.32 --> 1580.059
like what

1575.5 --> 1580.059
yeah that interview was very special

1580.4 --> 1587.8600000000001
it certainly set the bar very high

1583.76 --> 1587.86
in a way and that was very cool

1588.26 --> 1591.64
yeah allegedly Dave

1595.19 --> 1598.339
[Music]

1608.779 --> 1614.6
but the things that for me like

1611.5 --> 1617.059
overwhelmingly convinced me

1614.6 --> 1621.2199999999998
not just preliminary

1617.059 --> 1621.22
was more like detail work

1623.24 --> 1627.6200000000001
like some of these people that would

1626.12 --> 1629.7199999999998
call into Mark Sergeant or his

1627.62 --> 1634.1
interviews

1629.72 --> 1636.32
like military people testifying about

1634.1 --> 1640.3999999999999
how

1636.32 --> 1642.32
they literally aim at stuff

1640.4 --> 1644.0
that's like a hundred miles away and

1642.32 --> 1645.559
they don't take into account any

1644.0 --> 1647.299
curvature

1645.559 --> 1649.46
like at all

1647.299 --> 1651.98
like that sort of thing

1649.46 --> 1655.46
and like with radar like

1651.98 --> 1657.98
because that's just a machine doing it

1655.46 --> 1660.74
right that's not somebody trying to

1657.98 --> 1662.179
describe how they think of it right and

1660.74 --> 1664.22
that's

1662.179 --> 1666.799
yeah that's just really hardcore

1664.22 --> 1670.0
approved to me

1666.799 --> 1670.0
it's still the physical

1670.34 --> 1673.34
beta

1678.4 --> 1684.44
and that revealed to me also that

1681.86 --> 1686.4399999999998
that how the ball Earth is really just

1684.44 --> 1690.0800000000002
like a set of

1686.44 --> 1693.4
myths that are just like told like fairy

1690.08 --> 1693.3999999999999
tales about the globe Earth

1694.1 --> 1698.1789999999999
and that if you leave them out it's just

1695.779 --> 1700.82
like no everything's just used flat

1698.179 --> 1703.64
but there's fairy tales how you can

1700.82 --> 1706.039
think of it as a globe like oh yeah we

1703.64 --> 1708.98
need to account for Korea's deviation

1706.039 --> 1712.34
but they don't actually do it

1708.98 --> 1714.559
right or oh we have to account for the

1712.34 --> 1717.1399999999999
curve of the Earth and

1714.559 --> 1719.48
aim the radar right so it bounces off

1717.14 --> 1722.179
the ionosphere when in actuality they

1719.48 --> 1726.039
don't do that at all

1722.179 --> 1728.779
right so it's just a set of little

1726.039 --> 1732.559
excuses and tricks

1728.779 --> 1736.22
that you just say alongside of using all

1732.559 --> 1738.74
that equipment flat

1736.22 --> 1742.179
and that's what I really figured out

1738.74 --> 1742.179
like more vividly

1742.94 --> 1747.76
so basically to connect the two up

1745.64 --> 1752.0800000000002
instead of having them very much

1747.76 --> 1752.08
compartmentalized like it being flat

1752.299 --> 1758.059
and the world being a globe I had it

1754.52 --> 1760.94
very much compartmentalized most most uh

1758.059 --> 1764.72
most of my life

1760.94 --> 1767.419
but when that kind of testifying

1764.72 --> 1769.52
came around on Flat Earth Clues and Mark

1767.419 --> 1771.14
Sergeant interviews that's when I really

1769.52 --> 1774.44
started to like

1771.14 --> 1776.6000000000001
understand what both were and how they

1774.44 --> 1778.76
were connected like I just explained

1776.6 --> 1781.2199999999998
it's just I have a couple of myths on

1778.76 --> 1783.44
how you can think of it as a globe they

1781.22 --> 1785.8990000000001
don't actually apply it

1783.44 --> 1788.779
so it's like a set of fairy tales that

1785.899 --> 1790.9399999999998
just go about

1788.779 --> 1792.799
people making excuses on how the Earth

1790.94 --> 1794.48
is a globe

1792.799 --> 1797.179
and yet you have to do certain things

1794.48 --> 1799.46
even though they literally don't do them

1797.179 --> 1801.2
this is a trick every time it's like you

1799.46 --> 1802.94
want to be part of the trick of trying

1801.2 --> 1804.679
to convince everybody the Earth is a

1802.94 --> 1806.8400000000001
globe

1804.679 --> 1809.0590000000002
well you have to understand how to

1806.84 --> 1811.1
reason that out

1809.059 --> 1812.72
and you have to know how it actually

1811.1 --> 1814.399
works

1812.72 --> 1815.96
flat

1814.399 --> 1820.1
otherwise

1815.96 --> 1822.679
you won't be able to Bluff correctly

1820.1 --> 1826.039
that is a globe so it's like you need to

1822.679 --> 1828.38
know it's flat in order to Bluff

1826.039 --> 1830.419
that the Earth is a globe

1828.38 --> 1832.8200000000002
otherwise you don't literally understand

1830.419 --> 1834.0200000000002
what's going on how it works and you'll

1832.82 --> 1837.98
just be

1834.02 --> 1840.279
parroting tricks from people that do

1837.98 --> 1840.279
understand

1850.22 --> 1852.7
yeah

1853.039 --> 1857.6589999999999
yes peace and wealth Seeker I I

1855.74 --> 1859.039
literally posted the link earlier in

1857.659 --> 1862.0
chat

1859.039 --> 1862.0
to that stream

1891.46 --> 1896.26
following star is not propagating upward

1896.779 --> 1899.779
right

1901.24 --> 1908.02
that's weird slow man buggy because I

1904.82 --> 1908.02
have actually seen that

1911.72 --> 1917.14
sometimes Stars kind of shoot upward as

1914.899 --> 1917.1399999999999
well

1917.24 --> 1921.58
I think there's even video outfit out

1919.399 --> 1921.58
there

1932.179 --> 1938.24
shoot upward even more so this like yeah

1935.6 --> 1939.4399999999998
falling stars are just freaking weird I

1938.24 --> 1941.659
mean I'm not even

1939.44 --> 1943.3400000000001
I think they're holographic and when

1941.659 --> 1945.679
they're holographic there should be no

1943.34 --> 1947.6589999999999
objections because there's no physical

1945.679 --> 1949.76
implications to them

1947.659 --> 1951.8600000000001
so there's no reason why they shouldn't

1949.76 --> 1954.559
be shooting Upward at all

1951.86 --> 1956.1789999999999
because they're not physical

1954.559 --> 1959.74
I'm just angular

1956.179 --> 1959.74
from the celestial sphere

1970.7 --> 1975.38
but I mean there might literally be two

1973.58 --> 1977.779
different types of falling stars right

1975.38 --> 1980.5390000000002
there might be sort of what we think as

1977.779 --> 1982.039
of as meteors things that actually leave

1980.539 --> 1985.46
smoke

1982.039 --> 1988.52
sound and even potentially as explode

1985.46 --> 1990.74
right like those big meteor things or

1988.52 --> 1992.84
whatever that was in in Russia

1990.74 --> 1995.539
on camera

1992.84 --> 1998.26
apparently they seem to have those

1995.539 --> 1998.26
sometimes

2000.46 --> 2005.32
and then there's the light blips that

2003.519 --> 2007.179
you get to see sometimes up there

2005.32 --> 2009.48
especially when it's a clear sky in

2007.179 --> 2009.48
August

2010.659 --> 2015.8200000000002
I think that those types of blips that

2013.72 --> 2018.279
that's actually not physical I think

2015.82 --> 2021.6
that's part of the celestial sphere the

2018.279 --> 2021.6
Hologram of it all

2021.94 --> 2026.7
you don't have you have nothing but the

2024.1 --> 2026.6999999999998
sight of it

2028.24 --> 2033.059
and often so quick it almost looks

2030.399 --> 2033.059
electrical

2049.899 --> 2053.7999999999997
shooting stars appear to go up yeah

2051.82 --> 2057.06
sometimes they do

2053.8 --> 2057.0600000000004
like I've seen that

2072.82 --> 2077.5
going over your head well no falling

2075.339 --> 2080.399
stars usually don't have that long a

2077.5 --> 2080.399
trajectory anyway

2084.639 --> 2091.02
the falling stars don't go no they go

2091.3 --> 2096.2200000000003
that's most of them

2093.52 --> 2098.74
it's very quick like within half a

2096.22 --> 2100.8999999999996
second or so like half a second or four

2098.74 --> 2103.72
half second is a pretty damn long

2100.9 --> 2109.96
appearance for a falling star

2103.72 --> 2113.3999999999996
right but they also do go oh

2109.96 --> 2113.4
they do that just as well

2129.22 --> 2137.4399999999996
how does a falling star go up

2132.28 --> 2140.2000000000003
well it it's not falling falling star is

2137.44 --> 2142.859
a physicality assumption bias based name

2140.2 --> 2142.859
for it

2143.14 --> 2147.06
and it's part of the celestials

2147.28 --> 2150.599
so it's holographic

2151.359 --> 2157.5989999999997
there's nothing in euclidean space

2154.02 --> 2160.859
changing actual position

2157.599 --> 2160.8590000000004
that's what I'm saying

2177.94 --> 2182.669
foreign

2179.63 --> 2182.6690000000003
[Music]

2199.26 --> 2207.78
no turret I just said there's two

2202.78 --> 2211.38
different things two two completely

2207.78 --> 2211.38
different things

2212.22 --> 2218.2599999999998
part of the celestial holographic

2215.079 --> 2220.3
shooting stars so

2218.26 --> 2223.3
and then there is a

2220.3 --> 2227.26
meteor thing where something actually

2223.3 --> 2229.78
comes close to us a physical thing that

2227.26 --> 2232.0
burns and leaves smoke and makes noise

2229.78 --> 2233.26
it creates sound waves might even

2232.0 --> 2236.76
explode

2233.26 --> 2236.76
with a big flash of light

2238.72 --> 2243.0989999999997
yeah

2240.46 --> 2245.7400000000002
that would I would say meteor not

2243.099 --> 2248.02
falling star meteor and that's a

2245.74 --> 2249.0989999999997
physical thing and I don't know how that

2248.02 --> 2251.2
happens

2249.099 --> 2254.2000000000003
or why where it's actually coming from

2251.2 --> 2258.64
it's a big mystery but I do know it's

2254.2 --> 2261.8199999999997
not absolutely not the same thing as a

2258.64 --> 2264.7599999999998
shooting falling star

2261.82 --> 2267.88
because that's a purely holographic

2264.76 --> 2269.32
thing that happens

2267.88 --> 2272.44
there's no proof there's anything

2269.32 --> 2275.2200000000003
physical involved

2272.44 --> 2277.2400000000002
only a light effect that you get to see

2275.22 --> 2279.22
no sound

2277.24 --> 2282.64
no material

2279.22 --> 2284.859
no smoke nothing

2282.64 --> 2287.52
it's just a little blip and that's all

2284.859 --> 2287.52
you get to see

2290.19 --> 2293.34
[Music]

2305.74 --> 2313.839
[Music]

2311.44 --> 2315.7000000000003
so it's very simple

2313.839 --> 2317.859
you see something

2315.7 --> 2321.04
it's making a sound

2317.859 --> 2324.5789999999997
it's leaving smoke

2321.04 --> 2326.079
that's the physical thing

2324.579 --> 2328.92
all right

2326.079 --> 2328.92
that's physical

2329.02 --> 2332.8
now if you just see something you happen

2331.54 --> 2334.06
to look right in the right direction

2332.8 --> 2335.8
it's like

2334.06 --> 2337.24
that's all you see you don't hear

2335.8 --> 2339.4
anything

2337.24 --> 2341.9799999999996
you don't smell anything

2339.4 --> 2344.5
there's no smoke that's suddenly

2341.98 --> 2347.5
getting in front of other stars or the

2344.5 --> 2350.2
moon or whatever nothing it's just a

2347.5 --> 2353.28
holographic thing

2350.2 --> 2353.2799999999997
a light effect

2361.8 --> 2366.3
it should be too far there no

2366.46 --> 2370.2400000000002
if you're too far to hear you're too far

2368.859 --> 2373.14
to see

2370.24 --> 2373.14
more colored

2395.7 --> 2398.8999999999996
[Music]

2400.56 --> 2405.67
my point is you have no evidence

2403.839 --> 2410.86
that you're seeing anything physical

2405.67 --> 2410.86
[Music]

2413.39 --> 2420.1589999999997
[Music]

2434.859 --> 2438.22
but no evidence is not evidence of

2437.14 --> 2441.2799999999997
nothing

2438.22 --> 2443.0789999999997
why I didn't say anything in evidence of

2441.28 --> 2445.38
nothing I'm just saying like it's not

2443.079 --> 2445.38
physical

2447.94 --> 2451.96
I'm not saying like you're imagining it

2450.099 --> 2452.98
or anything I'm just saying it's not

2451.96 --> 2456.42
physical

2452.98 --> 2456.42
can you handle that

2465.52 --> 2472.14
I mean neither is the Sun or the Moon

2469.119 --> 2472.1400000000003
can you handle that

2479.98 --> 2484.66
I mean if you want to

2482.26 --> 2487.3590000000004
really believe

2484.66 --> 2490.42
or claim that it is physical then you

2487.359 --> 2492.16
you're gonna have to chase the Dragon

2490.42 --> 2493.1800000000003
you're gonna have to prove it's physical

2492.16 --> 2495.7
then

2493.18 --> 2498.1189999999997
yeah let's see some angular size

2495.7 --> 2498.1189999999997
increase

2498.94 --> 2504.0
for starters right

2501.82 --> 2509.2200000000003
let's establish a

2504.0 --> 2509.22
euclidean position in Space over Earth

2513.64 --> 2517.0789999999997
no evidence of any of it

2527.74 --> 2530.22
oh

2535.96 --> 2539.11
[Music]

2556.78 --> 2559.78
sorry

2559.96 --> 2561.96
um

2563.28 --> 2567.96
that certainly did hit the spot by the

2565.9 --> 2567.96
way

2577.06 --> 2582.099
so does anybody in here still have

2580.0 --> 2584.579
troubles with physicality assumption

2582.099 --> 2584.579
bias

2596.92 --> 2603.64
refuse to go all the way it went all way

2601.78 --> 2606.119
what you're describing is exactly what

2603.64 --> 2606.1189999999997
I'm doing

2607.26 --> 2612.48
what

2609.04 --> 2612.48
no I did not tear it

2617.68 --> 2620.3999999999996
huh

2622.48 --> 2627.119
if the firmament is actually a physical

2624.94 --> 2630.28
barrier is RV

2627.119 --> 2633.579
and some Fe claim

2630.28 --> 2634.8390000000004
what answer do they have for meteor

2633.579 --> 2637.42
showers

2634.839 --> 2639.4
they don't

2637.42 --> 2641.92
or they'll say it's like an electrical

2639.4 --> 2643.599
phenomenon or whatever

2641.92 --> 2646.359
I don't know

2643.599 --> 2651.0
but maybe I'm just not gonna hand them

2646.359 --> 2651.0
their dwelling based conclusions

2651.88 --> 2657.54
maybe they just have to follow my

2654.7 --> 2660.5989999999997
conclusions and stop their stupidity

2657.54 --> 2660.599
this is

2660.76 --> 2663.3590000000004
cat

2663.94 --> 2667.599
first off it's not a barrier if there's

2666.04 --> 2669.16
going to be affirmament it's not a

2667.599 --> 2671.44
barrier

2669.16 --> 2674.56
that would immediately infer that

2671.44 --> 2675.819
there's more space out there beyond the

2674.56 --> 2679.56
barrier

2675.819 --> 2679.56
I'm not buying that at all

2692.14 --> 2696.52
and I don't think it's dome-shaped

2694.0 --> 2699.599
either I think it's a flat top

2696.52 --> 2699.599
it's much more logical

2699.88 --> 2704.26
and I don't think it's necessarily even

2702.46 --> 2706.839
physical I just think it's the end of

2704.26 --> 2710.5
space it's non-space

2706.839 --> 2715.359
so it's just the end of that

2710.5 --> 2719.16
no more space for material to move into

2715.359 --> 2719.16
the end of the road upward

2734.92 --> 2737.92
appease

2739.18 --> 2742.3799999999997
yeah yeah whatever

2757.119 --> 2764.619
it seems to me extremely illogical that

2761.2 --> 2767.2
God the designer of this place

2764.619 --> 2769.56
would design it in a way that it was

2767.2 --> 2769.56
like

2769.839 --> 2776.2
fragile based on the very substance

2773.619 --> 2779.079
that he was literally creating out of

2776.2 --> 2784.839
nothing that he would make the very

2779.079 --> 2789.04
creation itself flawed to entropy

2784.839 --> 2790.9
that only exists within it

2789.04 --> 2794.2
that would be like just creating

2790.9 --> 2799.14
something just to self-destruct

2794.2 --> 2799.14
it it seems very pointless to do that

2804.46 --> 2808.96
so I think that it's just a Continuum

2807.16 --> 2811.42
it's just

2808.96 --> 2814.38
just an available space that allows

2811.42 --> 2814.38
matter to exist

2814.839 --> 2819.359
that's being kept in place as it is

2822.099 --> 2826.38
and potentially altered and managed

2826.54 --> 2833.2599999999998
from the outside in in outside it means

2830.98 --> 2835.72
literally nothing

2833.26 --> 2838.44
like outside as in outside of physical

2835.72 --> 2838.4399999999996
reality

2844.78 --> 2847.78
foreign

2856.839 --> 2862.24
yes of course this be super super strong

2860.14 --> 2864.52
and then and then they'll figure out an

2862.24 --> 2866.859
even stronger

2864.52 --> 2868.359
substance they can make to it and then

2866.859 --> 2870.88
they'll say oh of course it's made out

2868.359 --> 2873.04
of that right because it's always made

2870.88 --> 2875.92
out of the strongest conceivable

2873.04 --> 2877.359
material a person can think of in that

2875.92 --> 2879.46
time span

2877.359 --> 2881.64
it's always going to be made of that

2879.46 --> 2884.68
yeah

2881.64 --> 2887.74
or it's not a substance and it's

2884.68 --> 2890.56
literally the end of space it it cannot

2887.74 --> 2892.7799999999997
under any circumstances except for the

2890.56 --> 2897.22
the resolution of physical reality

2892.78 --> 2899.5600000000004
itself be dented or altered yeah I think

2897.22 --> 2902.0789999999997
that's pretty damn strong

2899.56 --> 2906.2799999999997
I mean there is literally nothing more

2902.079 --> 2909.1600000000003
strong than non-space than literal

2906.28 --> 2910.3590000000004
inability of physical matter to move

2909.16 --> 2913.66
within it

2910.359 --> 2916.0
nothing can be stronger

2913.66 --> 2919.06
because every other definition of

2916.0 --> 2922.78
strength is all based on

2919.06 --> 2924.94
abilities within physical existence in

2922.78 --> 2927.2200000000003
in which they can be broken You could

2924.94 --> 2930.099
argue because of entropy well non-space

2927.22 --> 2931.7799999999997
is not subjected to entropy because it's

2930.099 --> 2934.78
not physical

2995.56 --> 3002.18
wow that's why Europe so you guys just

2998.74 --> 3002.18
fantasize about it do you

3003.24 --> 3007.7999999999997
so it is physicality assumption-wise you

3005.64 --> 3011.819
want it to be physical because then you

3007.8 --> 3014.3
can think of it and how strong it is

3011.819 --> 3016.92
I just explained to you that

3014.3 --> 3018.599
architecturally strongest possible

3016.92 --> 3022.56
option

3018.599 --> 3025.2000000000003
like the strongest conceivable option is

3022.56 --> 3028.92
non-space nothing

3025.2 --> 3032.46
that is physical is strong enough

3028.92 --> 3034.5
to alter to even alter or scratch

3032.46 --> 3036.859
non-space because it is literally

3034.5 --> 3036.859
nothing

3037.5 --> 3042.839
it is the inability

3039.839 --> 3047.2999999999997
of material it's like literally the

3042.839 --> 3052.0299999999997
inability of material to move there

3047.3 --> 3057.07
there is nothing more strong than that

3070.2 --> 3075.72

3073.8 --> 3078.9
get it it's all speculation it's nice

3078.9 --> 3084.3
like a couple of light years ahead

3082.559 --> 3088.099
okay

3084.3 --> 3088.099
and I just presented the

3088.559 --> 3094.6800000000003
the most strong thing that is even

3092.46 --> 3098.16
theoretically possible

3094.68 --> 3102.74
and I mean there is nothing that anybody

3098.16 --> 3102.74
could think of that could be stronger

3103.74 --> 3107.819
yes

3105.0 --> 3109.92
that's what I'm saying

3107.819 --> 3112.579

3109.92 --> 3112.579

3121.0 --> 3125.04

3123.059 --> 3127.02

3128.16 --> 3132.359
no matter what happens to the material

3132.359 --> 3135.859
immovable than non-space

3139.619 --> 3144.48
it doesn't it need to be physical to

3142.14 --> 3145.92
keep all the air in

3144.48 --> 3147.839
uh

3145.92 --> 3151.88
well

3147.839 --> 3151.88
if the air can move in it

3152.28 --> 3158.4
right what it needs to be physical to

3155.819 --> 3161.16
prevent air from moving past it yeah but

3158.4 --> 3164.28
what if it's simply the inability of

3161.16 --> 3166.319
material to move there I mean that's

3164.28 --> 3168.7200000000003
gonna prevent material from moving there

3166.319 --> 3172.44
if you know what I mean

3168.72 --> 3174.54
like end of volume no more space to move

3172.44 --> 3176.76
into

3174.54 --> 3180.48
doesn't need to be strong for that it

3176.76 --> 3183.8
just needs to have lack of ability for

3180.48 --> 3183.8
material to exist in

3185.52 --> 3191.46
yeah no more volume you can't go there

3188.72 --> 3192.98
non-space there's literally no more

3191.46 --> 3197.059

there is no outside of physicality while

there's no physical outside of

3227.819 --> 3231.68
physicality that's right

3232.74 --> 3239.16
in order to be physical you need a

3236.76 --> 3243.119
volume

in which physical can do what it does

3243.119 --> 3249.1800000000003
yeah there needs to be a volume for all

3246.059 --> 3251.2200000000003
those things to work and interact and

3249.18 --> 3253.319
undergo entropy

3251.22 --> 3255.24
there's no volume for them to do

3253.319 --> 3257.099
anything and then there's literally

3255.24 --> 3259.7
nothing there and there will forever be

3257.099 --> 3259.7000000000003
nothing there

3261.72 --> 3264.68
nothing physical

3286.14 --> 3292.0789999999997
right I mean I've got my episodes about

3289.02 --> 3294.54
non-space several

3292.079 --> 3298.28
I I remember if I remember correctly you

3294.54 --> 3298.2799999999997
guys were there when I talked about that

3301.14 --> 3305.97
[Music]

3306.42 --> 3311.16
yeah LSG is one of the guys that

3309.059 --> 3313.7000000000003
actually gets non-space I talked to him

3311.16 --> 3313.7
about it

3314.04 --> 3317.48
outside of the show too

3339.72 --> 3344.16
the edge of the universe

3342.42 --> 3345.96
right

3344.16 --> 3349.5589999999997
well that's the funny thing where they

3345.96 --> 3352.02
go with their astrophysical nonsense

3349.559 --> 3353.46
into these types of conceptions like oh

3352.02 --> 3355.74
the edge of the universe yeah that's

3353.46 --> 3358.2
where the volume ends yeah well then

3355.74 --> 3361.5589999999997
that would mean non-space then behind it

3358.2 --> 3363.18
oh you think it's growing New Year

3361.559 --> 3366.48
so it's just volume it's just

3363.18 --> 3369.18
manifesting then

3366.48 --> 3373.38
like what they are suggesting is that

3369.18 --> 3377.64
the volume of the container is growing

3373.38 --> 3379.859
like the realm itself is growing bigger

3377.64 --> 3383.64
and that is an interesting idea though

3379.859 --> 3387.0589999999997
because I can't exclude it right

3383.64 --> 3389.64
I can't exclude that the the absolute

3387.059 --> 3391.8590000000004
must be limited volume because there

3389.64 --> 3395.64
cannot be an endless volume that's a

3391.859 --> 3398.16
fact that's a logical fact

3395.64 --> 3402.42
it doesn't mean that it can't be growing

3398.16 --> 3403.7999999999997
like non-space could recede

3402.42 --> 3407.099
as in

3403.8 --> 3410.7000000000003
sadly volume becomes available

3407.099 --> 3413.099
and who knows with it maybe it wouldn't

3410.7 --> 3416.0989999999997
even be empty space that's manifesting

3413.099 --> 3419.88
but with it maybe God would literally

3416.099 --> 3423.119
just manifest more matter to fill in

3419.88 --> 3425.7000000000003
that manifesting space so literally the

3423.119 --> 3428.819
realm could be growing

3425.7 --> 3430.98
and material that technically did not

3428.819 --> 3433.859
exist before that moment couldn't be

3430.98 --> 3436.02
made into existence as if it were always

3433.859 --> 3439.92
existed from the start

3436.02 --> 3442.14
like the formation process the actual

3439.92 --> 3445.26
manifestation of the matter when that

3442.14 --> 3446.7599999999998
originally proceeded it manifested and

3445.26 --> 3448.5
then you could argue it stopped

3446.76 --> 3450.599
manifesting because that's the volume

3448.5 --> 3454.14
set for the realm but then later the

3450.599 --> 3456.9
realm could be expanded and suddenly

3454.14 --> 3459.5
the same matter is there like it was

3456.9 --> 3459.5
always there

3459.54 --> 3465.24
it simply didn't exist yet but it was

3462.24 --> 3467.64
manifested just like the rest

3465.24 --> 3469.2
yeah this gets a little complicated but

3467.64 --> 3471.54
that's how I imagined it could happen

3469.2 --> 3475.3799999999997
the realm itself the available volume

3471.54 --> 3476.819
could somehow be growing

3475.38 --> 3479.579
or

3476.819 --> 3481.38
or there could be many compartments and

3479.579 --> 3484.079
that could certainly open up to one

3481.38 --> 3484.859
another like the gates of Avalon to the

3484.079 --> 3488.7000000000003
north

3484.859 --> 3491.16
which I did an episode about recently

3488.7 --> 3494.46
right there could be more volume out

3491.16 --> 3498.48
there that's just not connected to us

3494.46 --> 3501.9
that could be made to be connected to us

3498.48 --> 3504.96
or there is a giant volume

3501.9 --> 3508.859
that's kind of hard to reach

3504.96 --> 3511.14
more adjacent to the Palm Theory

3508.859 --> 3514.319
it's a lot of ice everywhere and that it

3511.14 --> 3516.48
could also be growing that basically the

3514.319 --> 3518.819
ice cape and the amount of puns is

3516.48 --> 3520.5
growing that could be it but it's not

3518.819 --> 3523.98
going to be endless though

3520.5 --> 3526.02
like even the Palm theory has to be at

3523.98 --> 3527.7
an end you're going to have pawns like

3526.02 --> 3529.799
oh this is our little realm or little

3527.7 --> 3531.48
pod with a little Sun there's a lot of

3529.799 --> 3533.099
ice there oh there's another part and

3531.48 --> 3533.819
here's another phone there's not that's

3533.099 --> 3537.98
cool

3533.819 --> 3541.2
but at some point it has to be no more

3537.98 --> 3544.68
like there is no more space available

3541.2 --> 3548.3999999999996
for that even for the eyes

3544.68 --> 3550.44
there has to be a finite volume

3548.4 --> 3554.94
one way or the other but who knows maybe

3550.44 --> 3557.52
that entire volume is still growing

3554.94 --> 3560.579
that Newman matter is manifesting with

3557.52 --> 3562.799
the new added volume who knows I don't

3560.579 --> 3564.7200000000003
know if that's the case

3562.799 --> 3567.48
funnily enough what I'm now describing

3564.72 --> 3569.9399999999996
is actually exactly how it is described

3567.48 --> 3571.859
in Dungeons and Dragons how a pocket

3569.94 --> 3574.2000000000003
Universe Works

3571.859 --> 3576.72
which is a

3574.2 --> 3578.8799999999997
like a very heavy type of magic which

3576.72 --> 3580.68
you create your own little dimension

3578.88 --> 3582.48
what it literally say is just like yeah

3580.68 --> 3585.68
the volume grows and the matter just

3582.48 --> 3585.68
manifests in there

3585.72 --> 3590.64
but it literally grows it grows over

3588.18 --> 3592.3799999999997
time a pocket Dimension grows bigger

3590.64 --> 3594.299
over time and if you have one that's

3592.38 --> 3597.96
like thousands of years old it could be

3594.299 --> 3600.359
like an entire Realm by itself

3597.96 --> 3603.359
it's a fascinating concept

3600.359 --> 3606.42
and it could be

3603.359 --> 3609.42
how the actual physical reality works

3606.42 --> 3613.02
and by that saying that you could say

3609.42 --> 3614.52
this entire thing is like God's Pocket

3613.02 --> 3617.579
dimension

3614.52 --> 3620.7
the first material Realm

3617.579 --> 3621.96
like manifested as a pocket dimension

3620.7 --> 3625.2
just

3621.96 --> 3627.299
small like Garden of Eden small still

3625.2 --> 3629.8799999999997
very big and just growing and growing

3627.299 --> 3632.24
more and more and more things happening

3629.88 --> 3632.2400000000002
to it

3633.359 --> 3637.2799999999997
that could be this realm

3646.02 --> 3649.859
and someone needs to find the edge yeah

3648.119 --> 3653.46
but if it's looping then there is no

3649.859 --> 3655.74
Edge it's just hey it loops and then hey

3653.46 --> 3658.799
the loop just got wider

3655.74 --> 3661.3799999999997
now in that same Loop there's more space

3658.799 --> 3666.059
there it's like oh sudden new land

3661.38 --> 3667.1400000000003
appeared in the loop now it's longer

3666.059 --> 3672.559
yeah

3667.14 --> 3672.5589999999997
no Edge required dude no Edge required

3676.14 --> 3682.319
I mean it could be there could be a

3679.619 --> 3686.359
non-space barrier or whatever

3682.319 --> 3686.359
but it can also just be looping

3686.52 --> 3694.14
loops and non-space do they are

3689.88 --> 3696.96
compatible right if you have a realm

3694.14 --> 3700.74
that is some then something is happening

3696.96 --> 3703.2
to the realm like moving up upwards well

3700.74 --> 3706.74
guess what now non-space

3703.2 --> 3709.14
and looping is mechanically out of the

3706.74 --> 3712.799
picture that can't happen together if

3709.14 --> 3714.839
if it's like a physical object that's

3712.799 --> 3717.72
doing something in another medium the

3714.839 --> 3720.24
realm right that the realm is the object

3717.72 --> 3722.04
that's moving in another medium then you

3720.24 --> 3724.9199999999996
can't have non-space and you can't have

3722.04 --> 3727.799
a looping continuum

3724.92 --> 3729.299
because it is like an object in a bigger

3727.799 --> 3733.64
space

3729.299 --> 3733.64
so then that you just can't do that

3734.28 --> 3740.9
but if if that's not the case and it is

3736.799 --> 3743.94
a Continuum well then

3740.9 --> 3746.88
existence itself only exit physical

3743.94 --> 3748.5
existence itself is bound to that volume

3746.88 --> 3749.819
that is there and then how it

3748.5 --> 3752.04
interconnects

3749.819 --> 3754.319
can be in any sort of form because

3752.04 --> 3757.5589999999997
there's literally nothing else that

3754.319 --> 3758.7
exists and then a Continuum a looping

3757.559 --> 3762.5400000000004
system

3758.7 --> 3764.04
and a death pen barrier which would be

3762.54 --> 3766.14
non-space because there's literally

3764.04 --> 3770.22
nothing Beyond it

3766.14 --> 3773.18
they can very well fit there

3770.22 --> 3773.18
in that design

3774.24 --> 3780.1189999999997
both could be looping in certain

3777.66 --> 3782.2799999999997
directions maybe north and south to East

3780.119 --> 3784.7400000000002
and West for sure

3782.28 --> 3788.7000000000003
and then a barrier on top and maybe even

3784.74 --> 3790.9799999999996
at the bottom right maybe one day it

3788.7 --> 3793.22
will actually dig and it will be like oh

3790.98 --> 3793.22
another

3794.54 --> 3799.619
right not like that the Deep color

3796.68 --> 3801.8999999999996
borehole but like it like actor they're

3799.619 --> 3805.02
actually going to the end this time not

3801.9 --> 3807.599
a stupid little drill bit but just like

3805.02 --> 3809.64
like a gigantic tunnel and they just

3807.599 --> 3812.1800000000003
keep going down and down and down

3809.64 --> 3815.2799999999997
Forever Until It's like

3812.18 --> 3818.04
it's like yeah we're not we're just

3815.28 --> 3821.1600000000003
grinding the drill bit now it's just the

3818.04 --> 3823.38
drill bit is just grinding itself like

3821.16 --> 3825.359
there's nothing there

3823.38 --> 3829.02
did they receive the thing and it's like

3825.359 --> 3832.92
yeah there's just this black thing

3829.02 --> 3834.96
and it's literally unscratchable

3832.92 --> 3837.359
and there's nothing you can see it's

3834.96 --> 3841.079
just a black thing well that would be

3837.359 --> 3844.02
the non-space bottom

3841.079 --> 3847.1400000000003
right alternative is that like they dig

3844.02 --> 3848.7599999999998
through and it's like ah and then they

3847.14 --> 3850.68
crash down on the surface of Earth and

3848.76 --> 3852.2990000000004
it turned out to be looping opposite

3850.68 --> 3854.46
down as well

3852.299 --> 3856.619
but yeah

3854.46 --> 3858.78
who knows

3856.619 --> 3862.26
I mean let's dig to that bottom first

3858.78 --> 3864.3590000000004
actually do it like that's ever gonna

3862.26 --> 3867.2000000000003
happen

3864.359 --> 3867.2
thank you

3898.799 --> 3902.24
so comment what

3903.74 --> 3909.5
Longs done late what the [ __ ] does that

3907.26 --> 3909.5
mean

3932.22 --> 3937.02
if I think operation Fishbowl or Dominic

3935.099 --> 3939.559
are there to sigh of conspiracy

3937.02 --> 3939.559
theorists

3941.46 --> 3944.0
probably

3944.28 --> 3949.5
but if you consider that literally

3946.859 --> 3953.18
nuclear bombs don't exist then neither

3949.5 --> 3953.18
of those operations are real

3953.88 --> 3958.44
like they just didn't do anything it's

3956.28 --> 3961.52
just they're made up to make people

3958.44 --> 3961.52
think in a certain way

3969.26 --> 3975.0200000000004
[Music]

3971.819 --> 3975.02
of course they do

3983.42 --> 3987.96
thank you

3985.1 --> 3989.94
[Music]

3987.96 --> 3992.46
right well who knows maybe they just

3989.94 --> 3993.7200000000003
re-found the Gate of Avalon because I

3992.46 --> 3995.28
just talked about it and then they

3993.72 --> 3997.02
realized oh [ __ ] that's what we're

3995.28 --> 3999.2400000000002
supposed to do

3997.02 --> 4001.4
I highly doubt it

3999.24 --> 4004.339
but I mean yeah if they're gonna find

4001.4 --> 4007.52
some Realm to the North or South like

4004.339 --> 4009.5
through a gate they're definitely gonna

4007.52 --> 4011.24
call those planets

4009.5 --> 4013.819
it's like yeah we found another planet

4011.24 --> 4016.22
now get in this spaceship and then they

4013.819 --> 4019.64
basically haul the space the spaceship

4016.22 --> 4021.6189999999997
over a train through the loop gate

4019.64 --> 4024.7599999999998
and it's like oh we're on the other

4021.619 --> 4024.76
planet oh yes

4032.599 --> 4039.079
but I mean I dude I predicted that they

4035.599 --> 4042.619
would act like that like even in 2016

4039.079 --> 4045.44
already argued that it's like yeah of

4042.619 --> 4048.619
course they're gonna find other planets

4045.44 --> 4050.66
right it's just gonna be other realms

4048.619 --> 4052.94
and they'll even try to keep up the

4050.66 --> 4055.819
appearance that it's another planet and

4052.94 --> 4058.4
it would be in a similar way

4055.819 --> 4063.5589999999997
like that uh

4058.4 --> 4068.0
like the spacing Guild does in Dune

4063.559 --> 4071.1800000000003
if you saw the original old 60s or 70s

4068.0 --> 4073.28
Doom movie it's yeah I thought it's

4071.18 --> 4074.0
still very fascinating what they did in

4073.28 --> 4076.28
that

4074.0 --> 4078.579
style wise and all that but they

4076.28 --> 4078.579
literally

4079.88 --> 4084.6800000000003
the spacing Guild could literally be

4082.52 --> 4086.78
here in this Flat Earth realm and they

4084.68 --> 4090.44
could be fooling everybody right because

4086.78 --> 4093.5
space and guilt like teleports

4090.44 --> 4096.4400000000005
to another Realm like to another planet

4093.5 --> 4099.739
so they could just literally fool

4096.44 --> 4102.8589999999995
everybody that it's all planets like in

4099.739 --> 4105.259
Dune itself everybody could be fooled

4102.859 --> 4107.839
that it's planets

4105.259 --> 4111.38
and the spacing Guild would be the guilt

4107.839 --> 4114.199
that is fooling everybody in the Dune

4111.38 --> 4116.779
universe that it's planets

4114.199 --> 4119.66
yeah

4116.779 --> 4123.1
where they basically go from one realm

4119.66 --> 4125.9
to another and keeping its secret

4123.1 --> 4128.0
under cover of planets and you're stuck

4125.9 --> 4129.62
to your planet you can't get off your

4128.0 --> 4131.12
planet without us

4129.62 --> 4136.88
huh

4131.12 --> 4139.96
yeah that's what I came up with in 2016.

4136.88 --> 4139.96
ever thought of that

4154.64 --> 4158.799
what the [ __ ] are you bickering about

4175.299 --> 4182.0
the late I what the [ __ ] is that

4179.719 --> 4184.4800000000005
Derek could you please say what the hell

4182.0 --> 4184.48
that is

4187.219 --> 4193.9
forcing me to Google in

4189.739 --> 4193.9
like being forced to Google something

4194.9 --> 4200.139999999999
oh it's that diamond thing

4197.48 --> 4200.139999999999
okay

4211.42 --> 4217.78
immediary oh it's a meteorite based

4215.54 --> 4220.9
diamond

4217.78 --> 4220.9
alrighty then

4229.28 --> 4231.88
hmm

4243.86 --> 4249.139999999999
right so yeah tarot I hope I made it

4246.5 --> 4252.38
plenty clear still going back to that

4249.14 --> 4255.92
conversation and I think there's two

4252.38 --> 4258.14
things not one two things that are

4255.92 --> 4260.659
completely different

4258.14 --> 4262.46
one is a holographic phenomenon a

4260.659 --> 4264.379999999999
shooting star blip

4262.46 --> 4266.84
there's nothing there's nothing proving

4264.38 --> 4268.58
there it also does go up which comparts

4266.84 --> 4270.14
with holographics of the celestial

4268.58 --> 4272.12
sphere because the celestial sphere

4270.14 --> 4273.4400000000005
doesn't give a [ __ ] what your direction

4272.12 --> 4275.599999999999
is

4273.44 --> 4279.08
it moves over the sphere and it doesn't

4275.6 --> 4281.3
know up or down or any

4279.08 --> 4283.88
yeah

4281.3 --> 4286.400000000001
it's holographic and the other one is

4283.88 --> 4290.3
yeah there are physical things that come

4286.4 --> 4292.159
down I literally heard and saw one and

4290.3 --> 4295.1
saw the smoke that was left and I don't

4292.159 --> 4299.0199999999995
mean on a video I mean in physical world

4295.1 --> 4299.02
right here in this city

4300.62 --> 4303.28
I did

4305.48 --> 4312.139999999999
so meteors are physical

4308.719 --> 4314.54
I don't know where they're coming from

4312.14 --> 4316.219
there's all kinds of options for how

4314.54 --> 4318.44
that could be and I've done a hangout

4316.219 --> 4321.86
about that even in my flatter talks days

4318.44 --> 4324.98
and it remains a mystery let me be clear

4321.86 --> 4328.5199999999995
that remains a mystery

4324.98 --> 4330.08
of many conceptual roads as to how how

4328.52 --> 4332.540000000001
it could be

4330.08 --> 4335.6
but I don't know

4332.54 --> 4338.0
but what I do know is that meteors

4335.6 --> 4340.219
falling star blips

4338.0 --> 4343.04
little light blips that they're not the

4340.219 --> 4346.04
same thing they are two different

4343.04 --> 4346.04
phenomena

4348.82 --> 4351.38
[Music]

4349.76 --> 4353.860000000001
okay

4351.38 --> 4353.86
but

4362.179 --> 4366.62
talking about the yeah well meteor yeah

4365.06 --> 4369.4400000000005
when they come down dude there's Meet

4366.62 --> 4374.08
Your meteoric Glass

4369.44 --> 4374.08
there's gems cut out of meteor glass

4379.82 --> 4382.719
what's it called again

4383.52 --> 4387.099
[Music]

4405.52 --> 4412.219
impact tight what the [ __ ]

4408.679 --> 4414.7390000000005
no G what no way that's not what it's

4412.219 --> 4418.96
called what the hell is that

4414.739 --> 4418.959999999999
that's the dumbest name I've ever heard

4429.26 --> 4434.5
what the [ __ ] is it cool

4431.54 --> 4434.5
the one that

4439.06 --> 4444.6990000000005
right it doesn't seem to find the right

4441.92 --> 4444.6990000000005
name for it

4447.32 --> 4450.4
wait this is it

4456.679 --> 4460.3
is it multivite no

4473.62 --> 4477.04
maybe it was

4480.5 --> 4486.199
yeah it was modified yeah

4483.679 --> 4488.2390000000005
modified is meteoric glass it's green

4486.199 --> 4490.219
it's really awesome

4488.239 --> 4492.379999999999
there's gems

4490.219 --> 4494.36
like cut gems you can make with that

4492.38 --> 4497.38
stuff

4494.36 --> 4497.38
I have one

4500.179 --> 4503.7390000000005
so there is that

4601.58 --> 4606.699
talking about horror channels in my chat

4604.159 --> 4606.699
yeah

4609.32 --> 4614.84
why don't you go off with your deviant

4612.679 --> 4617.54
[ __ ] somewhere else and discuss that go

4614.84 --> 4621.28
and Discord or something

4617.54 --> 4621.28

Shut the [ __ ] up have a normal

4662.48 --> 4666.139999999999
conversation

4664.34 --> 4668.2390000000005
if this happens again I'm kicking you

4666.14 --> 4670.76
out

4668.239 --> 4673.879999999999
yeah no more lip

4670.76 --> 4676.84
no more whining

4673.88 --> 4676.84
I'm done with it

4685.96 --> 4688.96
all right

4689.62 --> 4694.64
I have to figure out a title for this

4692.659 --> 4698.98
thing

4694.64 --> 4698.9800000000005
it's not as cohesive as yesterday

4707.239 --> 4712.0599999999995
it's been a kind of a plethora of effect

4709.46 --> 4712.06
sir

4716.91 --> 4722.199
[Music]

4725.42 --> 4728.529
[Music]

4734.44 --> 4737.57
[Music]

4740.84 --> 4743.02
foreign

4764.14 --> 4767.320000000001
come on

4771.17 --> 4774.27
[Music]

4775.34 --> 4780.1990000000005
yeah this is what I'm doing looping

4777.98 --> 4783.44
realm non-space physical media and

4780.199 --> 4785.48
holographic falling star

4783.44 --> 4788.7
there you go

4785.48 --> 4788.7
[Music]

4790.91 --> 4794.12
[Music]

4807.14 --> 4811.52
hey turret

4809.36 --> 4814.46
that means you too I don't want to talk

4811.52 --> 4818.080000000001
I don't want your freaking fan [ __ ] of

4814.46 --> 4818.08
horror movies here okay

4826.88 --> 4831.88
just go discuss that somewhere else

4829.58 --> 4831.88
please

4844.1 --> 4848.4400000000005
you are not allowed into not space so

4846.92 --> 4851.8
stay out

4848.44 --> 4851.799999999999
that's funny

4854.48 --> 4859.4
but I mean it's

4857.179 --> 4861.9800000000005
yeah

4859.4 --> 4863.719
it's pointless to say to stay out like

4861.98 --> 4865.879999999999
you would need to say anything because

4863.719 --> 4868.58
it's literally impossible like nothing

4865.88 --> 4872.06
in the world could so it's kind of

4868.58 --> 4875.14
Superfluous to say stay out

4872.06 --> 4875.14
it's funny though

4875.199 --> 4880.36
but this something not quite right

4881.06 --> 4885.26
I'm just sticking to this summary since

4883.64 --> 4887.900000000001
I'm talking about so many different

4885.26 --> 4889.6990000000005
mechanical things I just like summarize

4887.9 --> 4891.5599999999995
them

4889.699 --> 4894.5199999999995
so you know that this show I'm talking

4891.56 --> 4894.52
about all these things

4910.58 --> 4916.48
what not horrible okay fine fine then

4929.84 --> 4932.26
what

4933.5 --> 4937.48
why would you bring that up

4941.6 --> 4945.88
how about I don't want to talk about

4943.52 --> 4945.88
that

4958.1 --> 4961.42
A5 roads

4965.06 --> 4970.659000000001
what the [ __ ] are you guys talking about

4967.159 --> 4970.659
now what are these numbers

4982.76 --> 4987.76
hey woodworking gummy bear I heard from

4985.219 --> 4987.76
you in a while

4991.699 --> 4996.5599999999995
my garden weeds exist in the open

4994.1 --> 5000.42
Universe Universe Loop well that's

4996.56 --> 5000.42
another loop that's the loop of life

5001.06 --> 5005.9400000000005
but I appreciate the creative

5005.98 --> 5010.239
connection there

5007.67 --> 5012.219
[Music]

5010.239 --> 5014.86
but yeah you could argue that life

5012.219 --> 5017.38
itself is also a looping throughout time

5014.86 --> 5018.58
if you think as time has a spatial

5017.38 --> 5022.92
dimension

5018.58 --> 5022.92
then yeah life might be looping

5027.4 --> 5032.86
but let's not think of time as a special

5030.04 --> 5035.86
attention because then we we do the same

5032.86 --> 5038.86
[ __ ] as Einstein created

5035.86 --> 5038.86
foreign

5047.88 --> 5051.14
[Music]

5052.32 --> 5055.86
technically it can

5059.5 --> 5064.239
you were hacked

5061.42 --> 5067.26
okay

5064.239 --> 5067.259999999999
how do you know

5073.54 --> 5079.38
what is the solution uh change your

5077.02 --> 5079.38
password

5081.159 --> 5088.36
do I make another profile no you just

5084.42 --> 5090.6
secure it again if you still can

5088.36 --> 5093.4
I mean if you no longer have control

5090.6 --> 5095.8
because the email or something changed

5093.4 --> 5097.719
and it's not your email yeah then you

5095.8 --> 5099.34
better make a new account but if you can

5097.719 --> 5101.5
still change the password just change

5099.34 --> 5105.04
the password and

5101.5 --> 5108.96
make it yeah make sure

5105.04 --> 5108.96
it's actually a secure password

5111.46 --> 5115.8
got Buddhist for joking too much all

5113.62 --> 5115.8
right

5117.46 --> 5122.7390000000005
okay fair enough yeah

5120.52 --> 5124.719
yeah being in a jokey mood that can't

5122.739 --> 5127.379999999999
get really on my nerves

5124.719 --> 5127.38
sometimes

5130.06 --> 5134.38
I mean I get in a jokey mood too

5132.159 --> 5136.96
sometimes but

5134.38 --> 5139.12
like when I'm not it's really annoying

5136.96 --> 5141.159
because when somebody's in jokey mood

5139.12 --> 5143.38
that's just a sign like yeah I'm not

5141.159 --> 5144.5199999999995
actually willing to focus and pay

5143.38 --> 5146.86
attention

5144.52 --> 5149.64
that's what that signals to me and it

5146.86 --> 5149.639999999999
pisses me off

5149.86 --> 5154.48
on my show that is I mean in general I

5153.1 --> 5156.400000000001
don't really care if you'd like that

5154.48 --> 5158.94
it'll just move my attention to somebody

5156.4 --> 5161.5599999999995
else but if you're on my show in my chat

5158.94 --> 5164.759999999999
then it's distracting it's like

5161.56 --> 5164.76
distraction in class

5169.48 --> 5173.28
unless it's like a jokey subject or

5172.9 --> 5174.699
whatever

5173.28 --> 5176.98
[Music]

5174.699 --> 5180.28
I mean when I talked about

5176.98 --> 5183.5199999999995
like dwarves in Panda suits I'm not

5180.28 --> 5185.5
gonna blame you for making jokes after

5183.52 --> 5187.120000000001
that point because that's just a really

5185.5 --> 5190.6
funny idea

5187.12 --> 5193.36
right so I'm not gonna like

5190.6 --> 5196.659000000001
create a a jokey

5193.36 --> 5198.94
bottom for you to feed on and then get

5196.659 --> 5200.259999999999
angry if you if you're getting a jokey

5198.94 --> 5201.699
mood because of that okay that's

5200.26 --> 5204.1
different

5201.699 --> 5205.839999999999
but I don't want just general joking

5204.1 --> 5208.120000000001
around when I'm actually trying to focus

5205.84 --> 5210.159000000001
and explain complicated things then it's

5208.12 --> 5212.76
really disruptive

5210.159 --> 5212.759999999999
right

5218.86 --> 5225.03
so I don't yeah well oh yeah you don't

5222.639 --> 5228.229
take it well that's your [ __ ] problem

5225.03 --> 5228.228999999999
[Music]

5229.3 --> 5232.719
evil nightmare if you don't take

5230.86 --> 5236.339999999999
anything serious on the internet well

5232.719 --> 5236.34
then that's your problem

5238.179 --> 5242.219
yeah then you don't learn anything

5239.86 --> 5242.219
either

5244.84 --> 5251.02
because it's all the same to you then

5248.44 --> 5252.44
it's not a problem at all yeah I'm sure

5251.02 --> 5254.1990000000005
it isn't

5252.44 --> 5256.419999999999
[Music]

5254.199 --> 5259.5
all right anyway

5256.42 --> 5259.5
let me take this

5262.48 --> 5264.48
um

5264.6 --> 5267.779
[Music]

5270.3 --> 5275.4400000000005
yeah but taking everything with a grain

5272.679 --> 5279.06
of salt is something different as not

5275.44 --> 5279.0599999999995
taking anything seriously

5281.199 --> 5284.58
that's not the same thing

5298.719 --> 5303.76
it's about the same for you oh so you're

5301.0 --> 5306.4
just terrible at expressing yourself in

5303.76 --> 5309.06
language then okay

5306.4 --> 5309.0599999999995
fair enough

5315.34 --> 5317.76
what

5322.12 --> 5326.5199999999995
are you talking about George Sanford

5335.08 --> 5339.78
welcome to have that opinion yeah

5341.38 --> 5344.219
I know

5344.56 --> 5347.46
the cars

5349.48 --> 5353.919999999999
oh you were talking about a [ __ ] car

5351.699 --> 5356.759999999999
no wonder I didn't know what the hell

5353.92 --> 5356.76
you were talking about

5356.8 --> 5361.360000000001
someone starting to think it was some

5359.08 --> 5363.46
secret military code or something I've

5361.36 --> 5368.04
actually been infiltrated for a while

5363.46 --> 5368.04
like what the [ __ ] are you talking about

5370.18 --> 5373.409000000001
[Music]

5375.88 --> 5380.400000000001
you got in trouble in class A lot yeah I

5378.04 --> 5383.56
bet you did

5380.4 --> 5385.659
well to be fair so did I but it's

5383.56 --> 5387.88
because I would have restless mood and

5385.659 --> 5389.739
then basically get into sort of anxiety

5387.88 --> 5392.400000000001
because of that and that would be super

5389.739 --> 5392.4
distracting

5394.54 --> 5398.62
just sometimes I just couldn't for

5396.4 --> 5401.739
because I always wanted to be a good boy

5398.62 --> 5404.62
like really like a good boy that's what

5401.739 --> 5406.32
I wanted that's what my mind wants what

5404.62 --> 5409.3
that my body goes like

5406.32 --> 5410.739
just go [ __ ] insane and then it's

5409.3 --> 5413.7390000000005
like

5410.739 --> 5416.259999999999
yeah I feel anguish

5413.739 --> 5421.36
and I'm distracted

5416.26 --> 5423.6990000000005
because of something weird feeling based

5421.36 --> 5425.5599999999995
and I can't make it stop that sort of

5423.699 --> 5428.159
thing and that would be seen as

5425.56 --> 5428.159000000001
disruptive

5429.219 --> 5432.94
and it would actually be kind of nice to

5431.08 --> 5434.139
be sent out of the class when I had that

5432.94 --> 5436.0599999999995
because

5434.139 --> 5438.46
it's not exactly Pleasant to be

5436.06 --> 5440.4400000000005
surrounded by a bunch of kids when you

5438.46 --> 5441.88
feel like that

5440.44 --> 5446.219
because all those kids are all looking

5441.88 --> 5446.219
at you like oh I could I could like

5447.34 --> 5451.96
like stamp that a little further into

5449.679 --> 5453.9400000000005
the ground if I was had one-on-one time

5451.96 --> 5457.0
with that like because that's how well

5453.94 --> 5459.879999999999
they were a lot of them are terrible

5457.0 --> 5462.0
kids were terrible on me and I mean

5459.88 --> 5464.92
terrible

5462.0 --> 5467.5
Relentless peer pressure Relentless

5464.92 --> 5470.32
never stopping that [ __ ]

5467.5 --> 5472.06
so it was kind of nice then we if I had

5470.32 --> 5474.219
a weird mood that they would just send

5472.06 --> 5477.04
me out of the class

5474.219 --> 5479.92
because then I had some like

5477.04 --> 5482.219
some breathing time away from [ __ ] up

5479.92 --> 5482.219
people

5513.1 --> 5515.820000000001
huh

5516.179 --> 5519.9
oh that's interesting

5522.34 --> 5527.139
so you kind of turn a little bit into a

5524.56 --> 5529.06
leprechaun do you to like cheer people

5527.139 --> 5531.9400000000005
up that are in a dark mood

5529.06 --> 5534.400000000001
okay fair enough woodworking gummy bear

5531.94 --> 5536.379999999999
that's technically a good quality to

5534.4 --> 5539.44
have especially if you're like in

5536.38 --> 5542.32
face-to-face situations

5539.44 --> 5545.44
however over the internet

5542.32 --> 5548.0199999999995
and with me I'm very serious I'm kind of

5545.44 --> 5549.5199999999995
strict really yeah that can be very

5548.02 --> 5552.159000000001
disruptive

5549.52 --> 5554.080000000001
but I bet you're an awesome guy to like

5552.159 --> 5558.839999999999
have around

5554.08 --> 5558.84
face to face would work and go anywhere

5565.54 --> 5570.719
the best medicine yeah it's also a

5567.82 --> 5570.719
distraction though

5581.08 --> 5586.44
not non-stops yes correct Richard G well

5584.26 --> 5586.4400000000005
said

5604.84 --> 5611.639
hmm

5607.239 --> 5611.638999999999
yeah fair enough would work gunny bear

5614.32 --> 5619.139
are you a veteran like where did you get

5616.6 --> 5619.139
shot at

5628.48 --> 5630.959999999999
yeah

5631.42 --> 5637.139
foreign

5633.06 --> 5637.139
the rough neighborhood or something

5689.32 --> 5695.04
all right whoa okay yeah you're full-on

5691.9 --> 5695.04
fat okay

5697.32 --> 5703.0
yeah I I I know about that I've heard of

5701.5 --> 5705.6
it before

5703.0 --> 5705.6
huh

5714.52 --> 5719.92
generally started right

5717.219 --> 5722.34
okay cool no now I know with certainly

5719.92 --> 5722.34
all right

5725.86 --> 5731.5
just know that like

5728.44 --> 5734.32
if I get pissed off usually and this is

5731.5 --> 5736.659
Universe if I get pissed off

5734.32 --> 5738.699
there's only one way to solve the

5736.659 --> 5740.44
situation that's to stop doing what

5738.699 --> 5743.86
pisses me off

5740.44 --> 5745.719
and then everything will be all right

5743.86 --> 5748.12
if you're in a giddy mood and you think

5745.719 --> 5749.92
like oh no I want to do it something

5748.12 --> 5752.04
else yeah then you're gonna just get my

5749.92 --> 5755.08
wrath and really no matter what

5752.04 --> 5759.42
that's just

5755.08 --> 5759.42
it doesn't matter to me how cool you are

5769.9 --> 5776.28
it's like just

5772.06 --> 5776.280000000001
don't push me that that's just it

5776.639 --> 5781.900000000001
because yeah I mean I can potentially

5779.98 --> 5784.239
get really vicious

5781.9 --> 5785.739
I don't like to it's really bad for me

5784.239 --> 5787.9
when that happens

5785.739 --> 5790.659
but I've just been the thing is I've

5787.9 --> 5792.58
been pushed around by people especially

5790.659 --> 5795.219
my youth like too much it's it's

5792.58 --> 5800.0199999999995
happened too much I've got a little

5795.219 --> 5803.62
allergy that's wroted directly in my ego

5800.02 --> 5804.88
and it's like it's not tannable like you

5803.62 --> 5807.82
got a choice

5804.88 --> 5810.46
you give in or you kill me

5807.82 --> 5812.58
because there's not gonna be anything in

5810.46 --> 5812.58
between

5816.659 --> 5821.799999999999
once that starts happening

5819.52 --> 5824.580000000001
I think you guys know that by now on

5821.8 --> 5824.58
intuitive level

5826.9 --> 5832.839999999999
when I give kiwi and Nathan the same

5829.12 --> 5835.3
route yeah and I [ __ ] have

5832.84 --> 5836.76
on their show

5835.3 --> 5841.0
yeah

5836.76 --> 5843.6
yes I have and people have heard that

5841.0 --> 5843.6
happening

5845.8 --> 5850.56
I don't [ __ ] [ __ ] to anybody

5848.86 --> 5853.8099999999995
anybody

5850.56 --> 5853.81
[Music]

5854.8 --> 5857.4400000000005
even if that means

5856.32 --> 5861.78
[Music]

5857.44 --> 5861.78
[ __ ] dead or poor as [ __ ]

5862.38 --> 5868.900000000001
it's no reason for me to start now

5866.98 --> 5870.94
I've already given up every [ __ ]

5868.9 --> 5873.82
thing in my life for that

5870.94 --> 5876.36
so it I wouldn't do that

5873.82 --> 5876.36
yeah

5877.6 --> 5881.620000000001
because that was the great struggle are

5880.0 --> 5884.679
you going to [ __ ] [ __ ] through this

5881.62 --> 5887.26
insane [ __ ] world or are you not

5884.679 --> 5889.4800000000005
and actually tried it for a while and

5887.26 --> 5892.02
then realized I'd end up killing myself

5889.48 --> 5895.36
really quickly because it's literally

5892.02 --> 5898.120000000001
incompatible with my soul and so then I

5895.36 --> 5900.5199999999995
rejected it all

5898.12 --> 5903.78
and basically said I'm not gonna be part

5900.52 --> 5903.780000000001
of the society anymore

5906.58 --> 5911.32
because it's so [ __ ] up it's

5908.92 --> 5913.3
unrepairable anything

5911.32 --> 5917.82
that would lure you in is always going

5913.3 --> 5917.820000000001
to end up dark and evil and twisted

5918.639 --> 5921.12
yeah

5921.28 --> 5925.0
and that's why I started doing this

5923.02 --> 5928.179
basically I'm literally trying to create

5925.0 --> 5929.32
basically like a society grassroot from

5928.179 --> 5931.36
scratch

5929.32 --> 5933.219
I know it sounds crazy

5931.36 --> 5935.86
but it is what I'm

5933.219 --> 5937.78
secretly or underneath it or actually

5935.86 --> 5942.28
wanting to do because

5937.78 --> 5945.159
I reject all this [ __ ] [ __ ] that's

5942.28 --> 5949.0199999999995
been happening throughout my entire life

5945.159 --> 5949.0199999999995
I reject all of it

5949.06 --> 5952.4400000000005
it's all [ __ ]

5953.02 --> 5958.179
the only good things that we even

5955.719 --> 5960.659
[ __ ] know are all over a hundred

5958.179 --> 5960.659
years old

5960.76 --> 5965.56
yeah

5962.679 --> 5967.9
medical wise Spirit knowledge wise it's

5965.56 --> 5972.159000000001
all over a hundred years old all this

5967.9 --> 5977.159
[ __ ] that I grew up in it's all garbage

5972.159 --> 5977.159
it's almost all garbage okay

5979.36 --> 5983.759999999999
it could argue that maybe the internet

5981.219 --> 5986.8
itself

5983.76 --> 5989.8
is not just garbage

5986.8 --> 5991.179
but everything that's that we get to see

5989.8 --> 5993.46
through the internet well that's

5991.179 --> 5995.62
certainly [ __ ] garbage

5993.46 --> 5999.0
it is social engineering that's coming

5995.62 --> 5999.0
through it is [ __ ] garbage

5999.82 --> 6003.96
people become more malleable more

6002.159 --> 6007.62
manipulable

6003.96 --> 6010.5
as long as it's their narrative and not

6007.62 --> 6012.139
the opposing narrative and people are so

6010.5 --> 6015.3
[ __ ] easily polarized it's

6012.139 --> 6017.34
unbelievable surreal

6015.3 --> 6019.139
and don't even realize that that's what

6017.34 --> 6022.08
it is

6019.139 --> 6024.0
so automatic and just like yeah oh this

6022.08 --> 6026.88
is the side I'm on in that conflict oh

6024.0 --> 6028.26
that's they don't even [ __ ] see it

6026.88 --> 6031.679
anymore people don't see it anymore

6028.26 --> 6035.76
because we were all raised in this [ __ ]

6031.679 --> 6038.58
from youth I was raised in that [ __ ]

6035.76 --> 6041.9400000000005
from youth everybody thought like that

6038.58 --> 6045.0199999999995
in the school everybody acted like that

6041.94 --> 6049.82
so which side of some stupid little

6045.02 --> 6049.820000000001
created nonsense thing are you on

6051.84 --> 6056.9400000000005
and I'm done with it I'm like I'm

6054.36 --> 6058.92
creating into entire new Society from

6056.94 --> 6063.48
scratch

6058.92 --> 6067.02
just like [ __ ] all of the manipulation

6063.48 --> 6070.0199999999995
like be aware of everything with the

6067.02 --> 6072.659000000001
brutal consequences that are real that

6070.02 --> 6074.06
all people do carry they're just too

6072.659 --> 6078.42
cowardly

6074.06 --> 6080.52
to face that that's real yeah and I'm

6078.42 --> 6083.52
here to put an end to that

6080.52 --> 6083.52
foreign

6090.69 --> 6094.599999999999
[Music]

6100.06 --> 6106.21
[Music]

6113.719 --> 6119.34
less we use our range yes

6117.239 --> 6122.28
did you know also that

6119.34 --> 6127.32
arguably I'm actually I've built myself

6122.28 --> 6128.88
off up I've built myself up from scratch

6127.32 --> 6132.179
mentally

6128.88 --> 6135.4400000000005
like an artificial intelligence

6132.179 --> 6135.4400000000005
have ever told you that

6136.32 --> 6141.98
and that process probably started like

6138.719 --> 6141.9800000000005
around when I was five

6142.32 --> 6148.139
where I really started to learn the

6145.44 --> 6152.219
value of making errors

6148.139 --> 6155.04
like on a fundamental level like higher

6152.219 --> 6157.619
intellect level I realized that

6155.04 --> 6160.619
and have been building it like that my

6157.619 --> 6163.679
life ever seen those videos of like a

6160.619 --> 6166.199
digitally visual represented world of an

6163.679 --> 6168.54
AI little robot that learns how to walk

6166.199 --> 6171.239
right probably seen that video it's

6168.54 --> 6173.34
enormously popular as millions of views

6171.239 --> 6175.739
right

6173.34 --> 6178.92
and you might even have like oh oh

6175.739 --> 6181.5599999999995
well guess what that's [ __ ] me that's

6178.92 --> 6183.7390000000005
like what it was like for me in this

6181.56 --> 6183.7390000000005
world

6185.04 --> 6190.82
like that's how my thinking work I was

6187.5 --> 6193.38
so stumbly so stupid so

6190.82 --> 6195.299999999999
incapable in ways it's like you see

6193.38 --> 6197.58
everything but you're utterly incapable

6195.3 --> 6199.26
right you got all the senses but no

6197.58 --> 6201.48
capability and just [ __ ] around

6199.26 --> 6203.46
stumbling around even though you already

6201.48 --> 6205.919999999999
have the higher Consciousness enormously

6203.46 --> 6208.32
frustrating hellish at times but

6205.92 --> 6210.06
eventually you [ __ ] catch a pattern

6208.32 --> 6211.619
and then you just know this is what you

6210.06 --> 6213.719
do that's what you do and you just know

6211.619 --> 6216.42
it and now it's fluid and now it's

6213.719 --> 6218.34
perfect and now all that data you

6216.42 --> 6220.56
collected throughout all that torture

6218.34 --> 6224.1
and all that failure it's suddenly all

6220.56 --> 6227.159000000001
fits like it it wasn't all for nothing

6224.1 --> 6228.06
all the failure wasn't for nothing at

6227.159 --> 6232.219
all

6228.06 --> 6235.5
and despite it looking clunky and clumsy

6232.219 --> 6240.42
what's behind it is actually an

6235.5 --> 6244.1
enormously powerful machine

6240.42 --> 6244.1
that is all about perfection

6244.679 --> 6249.54
and the real Perfection only comes

6247.38 --> 6252.900000000001
through like the worst and worst of

6249.54 --> 6258.199
Errors the most clunky shameful idiotic

6252.9 --> 6258.199
errors can yield the greatest perfection

6258.3 --> 6267.119000000001
if you accept facing the torture of it

6262.739 --> 6271.739
if you let the pain force your inner

6267.119 --> 6274.92
workings to grow to negate that pain

6271.739 --> 6278.339999999999
that's what the pain of it is

6274.92 --> 6282.54
that's why torture yield it forces you

6278.34 --> 6285.42
to grow it forces you yeah

6282.54 --> 6288.06
because it's not comfortable enough to

6285.42 --> 6293.84
just go around the Way You Are

6288.06 --> 6293.84
no torture forces you to adapt

6296.219 --> 6302.159
and I've went through a lot of it

6299.159 --> 6302.159
yeah

6304.84 --> 6309.96
[Music]

6306.48 --> 6313.379999999999
and I feel like I'm a freaking AI like

6309.96 --> 6316.44
I'm my spirit has converted to an AI

6313.38 --> 6318.84
system and I abandoned a lot of like the

6316.44 --> 6322.138999999999
more natural

6318.84 --> 6324.2390000000005
things it's like I I converted to

6322.139 --> 6327.4800000000005
roboticism

6324.239 --> 6330.718999999999
but not slave wise but slave to logic

6327.48 --> 6333.419999999999
like a Vulcan you could say in a way I

6330.719 --> 6335.639
had a great respect for Volk for like

6333.42 --> 6339.42
Spock and the Vulcan idea when I was a

6335.639 --> 6342.4800000000005
kid a lot like really a lot you could

6339.42 --> 6344.9400000000005
say hyper nerd lot

6342.48 --> 6346.259999999999
but I took it really serious is like no

6344.94 --> 6348.9
this is

6346.26 --> 6351.360000000001
that is the way if you're if you're

6348.9 --> 6354.679
literally cursed by Brilliance that is

6351.36 --> 6354.679
the only [ __ ] way

6354.9 --> 6358.32
because you have that torture side but

6357.0 --> 6360.9
you also have the brilliant side you

6358.32 --> 6362.88
have to compartmentalize them and still

6360.9 --> 6364.92
face the torture of the dark side

6362.88 --> 6367.1990000000005
because that is what eventually

6364.92 --> 6369.3
energizes

6367.199 --> 6373.04
the good side

6369.3 --> 6375.54
that's why you get the [ __ ] Dark Side

6373.04 --> 6377.1
alongside the good side when you're

6375.54 --> 6379.619
really [ __ ] smart

6377.1 --> 6382.38
because you need it it's not just oh

6379.619 --> 6384.42
you're just [ __ ] you're just [ __ ] if

6382.38 --> 6386.76
you're smart no it's there for a reason

6384.42 --> 6389.4
it has a function

6386.76 --> 6393.4400000000005
you have to undergo [ __ ] torture to

6389.4 --> 6393.44
make your intellect actually work

6393.659 --> 6401.719
cause the Flames of Consciousness are

6397.26 --> 6401.719
the same as the Flames of hell

6403.13 --> 6412.9400000000005
[Music]

6410.34 --> 6412.9400000000005
right

6419.76 --> 6421.76
um

6442.26 --> 6447.719
so don't go about life

6445.04 --> 6450.679
avoiding humiliation

6447.719 --> 6450.679
or pain

6458.96 --> 6463.619
don't go avoiding all that [ __ ]

6462.179 --> 6465.78
I have to just

6463.619 --> 6469.46
go out and do it and be [ __ ]

6465.78 --> 6473.699
humiliate and be hurt yeah

6469.46 --> 6478.159
Embrace that weakness that thing you

6473.699 --> 6478.159
love embrace it embrace it

6478.28 --> 6486.239
long for it long for the humiliation and

6483.48 --> 6489.299999999999
the weakness that is in you that will be

6486.239 --> 6492.659
there upon facing those things you're

6489.3 --> 6495.78
not familiar with long for it yeah when

6492.659 --> 6498.0199999999995
you're old you're gonna be nostalgic for

6495.78 --> 6498.0199999999995
it

6498.96 --> 6503.76
you're gonna look at a young person

6501.0 --> 6505.8
being all uncertain and clunky and

6503.76 --> 6507.54
you're gonna be like oh

6505.8 --> 6509.159000000001
so cute

6507.54 --> 6512.639
yeah

6509.159 --> 6517.44
long for it embrace it don't run away

6512.639 --> 6517.4400000000005
like a piece of [ __ ] sniveling coward

6517.619 --> 6524.759999999999
face it face that it makes you feel weak

6521.34 --> 6529.02
and incompetent face it shove it in your

6524.76 --> 6532.1990000000005
face like bury yourself in it

6529.02 --> 6535.34
until you start longing for it so that

6532.199 --> 6535.339999999999
you'll just do it

6536.04 --> 6542.659
and you'll do it because you long for

6539.159 --> 6542.659
the pain and the humiliation

6543.48 --> 6549.36
because then only then you'll just do it

6546.9 --> 6552.0599999999995
it'll just happen and guess what it'll

6549.36 --> 6554.159
completely nullify itself

6552.06 --> 6556.619000000001
because now you've you're just doing

6554.159 --> 6559.5599999999995
these things

6556.619 --> 6562.799999999999
and all those dreaded sensation and fear

6559.56 --> 6565.4400000000005
of humiliation and all that it literally

6562.8 --> 6568.320000000001
completely nullifies

6565.44 --> 6571.32
it's not resolve it nullifies like it

6568.32 --> 6574.799999999999
was never there because it was never

6571.32 --> 6578.4
really there it was only there

6574.8 --> 6583.639
the pain and the the humiliation to open

6578.4 --> 6587.638999999999
you up to that moment and make you

6583.639 --> 6589.679
integrate it assimilate the entire thing

6587.639 --> 6592.38
directly into your subconscious so that

6589.679 --> 6594.659
it's instantaneously normal to you like

6592.38 --> 6597.119
it always was and there is no more

6594.659 --> 6602.54
humiliation but the only way to actually

6597.119 --> 6602.54
get there you have to open yourself up

6602.82 --> 6609.179
to the thing you don't like about it

6606.719 --> 6611.04
you have to force yourself to do that

6609.179 --> 6613.38
thing you don't like and then when I

6611.04 --> 6616.56
mean you don't like like

6613.38 --> 6620.159000000001
the thing that really gets to you that

6616.56 --> 6622.26
really like automatically like a robot

6620.159 --> 6625.259999999999
makes you push away

6622.26 --> 6628.04
because Underneath It All you really

6625.26 --> 6628.04
don't like it

6630.3 --> 6634.860000000001
yeah now there's the weird thing I tried

6633.06 --> 6636.96
to do this effect what I'm now

6634.86 --> 6639.719
describing like facing the hell I try to

6636.96 --> 6642.3
do that with gay

6639.719 --> 6643.08
because otherwise it was going to rule

6642.3 --> 6644.6990000000005
me

6643.08 --> 6649.619
completely

6644.699 --> 6652.619
so I literally did just hang around that

6649.619 --> 6653.94
like in between that I tried to fight my

6652.619 --> 6656.759999999999
homophobia

6653.94 --> 6660.5599999999995
that by the way I didn't even [ __ ]

6656.76 --> 6660.56
admit to anybody yeah

6662.34 --> 6669.0
I always kept it to myself I always like

6665.3 --> 6671.42
just like yeah it's [ __ ] like

6669.0 --> 6671.42
laugh

6671.76 --> 6678.84
I tried to face it I I went among them

6675.36 --> 6681.719
I even [ __ ] ended up kissing a guy

6678.84 --> 6682.8
just to be certain and then I really

6681.719 --> 6684.84
knew

6682.8 --> 6688.219
it's like okay this is as far as I'm

6684.84 --> 6688.219
gonna take this test

6688.5 --> 6696.179
for myself and now I know

6693.0 --> 6699.6
like there's nothing I can do it wasn't

6696.179 --> 6702.78
a barrier that I needed to go through to

6699.6 --> 6704.820000000001
the other side it is just what it is

6702.78 --> 6709.759999999999
and I faced it

6704.82 --> 6709.759999999999
and now I really know what I am

6710.4 --> 6716.42
and it wasn't just like some

6713.159 --> 6716.42
thing in between

6717.6 --> 6723.54
like a test to go through no it's just

6719.94 --> 6724.98
like I am this way I really can't handle

6723.54 --> 6728.5199999999995
gay

6724.98 --> 6731.159
actual homosexuals I I really don't

6728.52 --> 6733.92
I was like I cannot even in my mind be

6731.159 --> 6737.58
made to accept it in any corner

6733.92 --> 6739.32
it's like I cannot be sympathetic to it

6737.58 --> 6741.84
ever

6739.32 --> 6745.219
ever

6741.84 --> 6745.219
like not once

6750.179 --> 6753.06
it's gross yeah I know it's [ __ ]

6752.159 --> 6756.119
gross

6753.06 --> 6758.280000000001
and I'm ashamed as [ __ ] and that's why I

6756.119 --> 6761.04
just said it that's why I [ __ ] say it

6758.28 --> 6763.5
on the internet yeah

6761.04 --> 6765.48
don't you get it don't you see with what

6763.5 --> 6767.28
I just described this is exactly what

6765.48 --> 6770.339999999999
I'm doing this is still the continuation

6767.28 --> 6772.0199999999995
of that test the pure humiliation of it

6770.34 --> 6776.4800000000005
all

6772.02 --> 6776.4800000000005
I'm open about that I did that

6779.34 --> 6783.900000000001
and I [ __ ] hate that it all happened

6781.38 --> 6785.58
but I do understand why it did all

6783.9 --> 6790.08
happen because

6785.58 --> 6793.86
I just was in on the other side

6790.08 --> 6797.88
in which gay was a good thing according

6793.86 --> 6800.339999999999
to [ __ ] everybody almost everybody

6797.88 --> 6802.92
like in the open like every it was all

6800.34 --> 6805.32
so the thing and like I didn't even

6802.92 --> 6807.5
realize really what it was most of the

6805.32 --> 6807.5
time

6815.88 --> 6822.6
like I'm more angry that I was basically

6819.3 --> 6824.9400000000005
on that other side living

6822.6 --> 6827.9400000000005
on that other side in which that is

6824.94 --> 6830.638999999999
normal in which gay is normalized I

6827.94 --> 6833.5199999999995
hated that more than I than me actually

6830.639 --> 6836.219
kissing a guy to find out that is really

6833.52 --> 6839.1
not homosexual I mean I hated more that

6836.219 --> 6841.7390000000005
I was on that side

6839.1 --> 6844.1990000000005
and that the [ __ ] country here is

6841.739 --> 6847.5
drenched in that [ __ ]

6844.199 --> 6850.86
like since I was born

6847.5 --> 6852.6
my parents actually tried to like give a

6850.86 --> 6855.38
little protected place where it wouldn't

6852.6 --> 6855.38
be like that

6856.98 --> 6860.659
but it didn't really work

6862.56 --> 6868.04
because

6864.3 --> 6868.04
yeah I was too isolated

6868.739 --> 6872.82
I eventually still like got out there I

6871.08 --> 6874.32
wanted to be popular I wanted to have

6872.82 --> 6877.699
friends I wanted

6874.32 --> 6877.699
girls to like me

6877.86 --> 6882.0
or want them to have wanted to hang

6880.02 --> 6884.820000000001
around with me and so I just literally

6882.0 --> 6887.58
did whatever the [ __ ] was necessary to

6884.82 --> 6890.34
become popular in that sense as far as I

6887.58 --> 6893.699
could take it without turning into like

6890.34 --> 6896.52
a disgusting manipulative

6893.699 --> 6900.719
weirdo that's completely not me but I

6896.52 --> 6903.42
did like really I was so desperate to

6900.719 --> 6906.02
just like how can I [ __ ] make people

6903.42 --> 6906.02
like me

6915.08 --> 6921.199
that's not [ __ ] funny fluffy snow

6917.76 --> 6921.1990000000005
shut the [ __ ] up

6921.6 --> 6927.659000000001
they are afforded

6924.6 --> 6931.76
[ __ ] is that about like everybody's

6927.659 --> 6931.759999999999
[ __ ] gay out there okay

6932.699 --> 6937.199
forcing me to it's a room what the [ __ ]

6935.76 --> 6940.02
are you whining about

6937.199 --> 6943.638999999999
forcing me to live with it like I'm not

6940.02 --> 6943.639
he's not here right now

6945.78 --> 6951.32
like

6947.42 --> 6951.32
why would you say that

6954.78 --> 6958.86
I mean the only place where you can

6956.58 --> 6961.8
really expect not to be forced to live

6958.86 --> 6963.599999999999
with a gay is in freaking Arabia

6961.8 --> 6966.3
okay

6963.6 --> 6969.6
the turkey or

6966.3 --> 6973.1990000000005
or Saudi Arabia or Iran or something

6969.6 --> 6976.139
I mean this is the Netherlands

6973.199 --> 6979.82
you're gonna face [ __ ] gays

6976.139 --> 6979.82
and even pre-teen

6991.98 --> 6996.0
made me believe that everyone around him

6994.5 --> 6998.4
was gay

6996.0 --> 7002.08
okay

6998.4 --> 7002.08
well maybe he was [ __ ] right

7002.6 --> 7006.6990000000005
and he just got a little obsessed over

7004.46 --> 7006.699
it

7023.6 --> 7030.02
a lot probably yes they are

7027.38 --> 7032.96
and I got to see how many [ __ ] people

7030.02 --> 7034.76
were gay when I was younger

7032.96 --> 7039.219
a lot

7034.76 --> 7039.219
it was like half of everybody

7041.54 --> 7045.58
and it really scared me

7049.94 --> 7055.879999999999
like how did we get to this point where

7053.119 --> 7058.699
literally half of every [ __ ] person

7055.88 --> 7060.8
out there is gay like how the hell did

7058.699 --> 7064.098999999999
we get to that point

7060.8 --> 7067.659000000001
how could this have happened

7064.099 --> 7067.659000000001
are they openly gay no

7069.199 --> 7073.638999999999
but that does mean that they aren't that

7071.719 --> 7075.5
they are not really gay

7073.639 --> 7078.619
how the hell did we get to that point

7075.5 --> 7079.699
where like half people are just gay this

7078.619 --> 7083.5
[ __ ]

7079.699 --> 7083.5
just really scary

7093.98 --> 7098.959999999999
you're trying to be funny what you see

7096.98 --> 7102.259999999999
yeah but it's not my own home I'm living

7098.96 --> 7105.08
in a house it's not my home nobody's

7102.26 --> 7106.639
like if I'm having my own house I'm not

7105.08 --> 7110.599
going to be forced to live with a gay

7106.639 --> 7113.2390000000005
okay fluffy snow don't worry about it

7110.599 --> 7117.159000000001
chemicals

7113.239 --> 7117.159
maybe more colored but it's

7120.56 --> 7125.320000000001
it's just [ __ ] freaky and

7129.8 --> 7137.54
it's just so [ __ ] scary that

7133.04 --> 7139.46
I like figured it out so young

7137.54 --> 7142.219
that I noticed

7139.46 --> 7145.52
so many people were like that so young

7142.219 --> 7148.34
and that's that that really

7145.52 --> 7149.780000000001
that really [ __ ] me up in ways you

7148.34 --> 7152.96
could you could argue that that

7149.78 --> 7155.5
partially helped me send me to hell in

7152.96 --> 7155.5
the Dark World

7155.599 --> 7159.88
because I found that out pre-teen

7169.099 --> 7171.88
dude I

7175.82 --> 7179.599
I could tell you something I feel very

7177.8 --> 7181.76
uncomfortable talking about I never did

7179.599 --> 7185.38
anything myself but I mean

7181.76 --> 7187.9400000000005
when I was very young there were like

7185.38 --> 7190.639
hordes of kids

7187.94 --> 7193.78
that would literally sell themselves for

7190.639 --> 7193.78
sex to other guys

7199.34 --> 7202.76
and sometimes their parents even knew

7201.5 --> 7205.3
about it and just didn't do anything

7202.76 --> 7205.3
about it

7206.119 --> 7212.5599999999995
I mean I as a kid I like

7209.239 --> 7212.5599999999995
seen it

7215.36 --> 7223.339999999999
and I'm talking about like

7218.719 --> 7226.88
dozens and dozens of of kids

7223.34 --> 7229.159000000001
and they and they wanted it yeah you

7226.88 --> 7231.9800000000005
know how much that [ __ ] you up to see

7229.159 --> 7234.98
that as a kid

7231.98 --> 7236.239
you have no idea it's like everybody's

7234.98 --> 7238.459999999999
demonic

7236.239 --> 7240.619
it's like oh we're all good guys but

7238.46 --> 7243.56
they're secretly [ __ ] demonic

7240.619 --> 7246.98
children that engage in like pure horror

7243.56 --> 7249.1990000000005
and they like it and like

7246.98 --> 7251.678999999999
I'm starting to sweat just thinking

7249.199 --> 7251.678999999999
about it

7283.4 --> 7287.719
I've seen that with kids drug yeah drugs

7285.92 --> 7291.08
too

7287.719 --> 7295.099
all those kids all got on drugs a lot of

7291.08 --> 7297.139
them actually died from overdose I think

7295.099 --> 7299.119000000001
I didn't really keep track of a lot of

7297.139 --> 7302.7390000000005
them I didn't know who they are I just

7299.119 --> 7302.739
noticed that it was so many

7305.0 --> 7312.199
and they all thought like they were

7306.92 --> 7314.17
winning too like they beat the system

7312.199 --> 7317.369
it oh

7314.17 --> 7317.369
[Music]

7321.139 --> 7325.28
I think I even told my parents about it

7323.78 --> 7326.54
and it [ __ ] them up too and they

7325.28 --> 7328.34
didn't know what to do with it and they

7326.54 --> 7330.5
just told me like just stay the hell

7328.34 --> 7333.92
away from that place

7330.5 --> 7336.44
stay away from those kids

7333.92 --> 7338.4800000000005
and I did after that point I really did

7336.44 --> 7340.219
that's also when I lost track of the one

7338.48 --> 7343.159
guy that was sort of my friend that was

7340.219 --> 7345.26
in the middle of that I I expect I'm not

7343.159 --> 7347.179
I'm not sure I think he actually did it

7345.26 --> 7350.780000000001
himself as well

7347.179 --> 7352.46
it's just unbelievably [ __ ] up

7350.78 --> 7355.159
but that later

7352.46 --> 7357.08
as a teenager

7355.159 --> 7359.96
like

7357.08 --> 7362.0
I got to know him again a bit and it

7359.96 --> 7364.46
turned out that he had like a really he

7362.0 --> 7367.52
became like a crack addict and [ __ ]

7364.46 --> 7370.34
after that almost got him killed but

7367.52 --> 7371.659000000001
then he actually turned to Scientology

7370.34 --> 7375.139
hahaha

7371.659 --> 7377.839999999999
and got out of it got all healthy

7375.139 --> 7380.3
and he did really so bad when I last saw

7377.84 --> 7381.679
him he well he had grown a lot kind of a

7380.3 --> 7385.219
big guy

7381.679 --> 7387.86
like a muscly type guy

7385.219 --> 7391.099
naturally not because of injected

7387.86 --> 7394.28
hormones but just naturally like that

7391.099 --> 7397.099
but he hadn't really changed his mind a

7394.28 --> 7400.28
lot he seemed like a lot more adult

7397.099 --> 7403.58
and responsible

7400.28 --> 7405.199
so that's but yeah I didn't gang with

7403.58 --> 7408.04
him because there was all this [ __ ] up

7405.199 --> 7408.04
[ __ ] going on

7410.36 --> 7414.259999999999
with him too

7412.159 --> 7416.719
I still remember like he even like

7414.26 --> 7419.42
threatened me and [ __ ] one time like

7416.719 --> 7422.2390000000005
actually threatened like with a knife on

7419.42 --> 7424.58
me but [ __ ] [ __ ] because I was gonna

7422.239 --> 7428.98
tell

7424.58 --> 7428.98
like his parents about what he was doing

7430.76 --> 7435.5
it's crazy man

7433.159 --> 7438.08
like I've seen some crazy [ __ ] it's

7435.5 --> 7440.659
really a miracle that I didn't like get

7438.08 --> 7443.239
really hurt or something

7440.659 --> 7445.699
but it was also because I just had this

7443.239 --> 7448.04
technique of just shut the [ __ ] up Arwin

7445.699 --> 7450.919999999999
just you just don't talk just don't talk

7448.04 --> 7454.159
about it until you forget about it

7450.92 --> 7456.92
and that did actually work it did

7454.159 --> 7458.839999999999
actually work I did blissfully forget

7456.92 --> 7461.9
about it

7458.84 --> 7465.08
and then just like oh yeah

7461.9 --> 7468.5599999999995
so what I just said for example is like

7465.08 --> 7473.0
a a little hole in between there

7468.56 --> 7475.52
that that I rarely look down into

7473.0 --> 7477.5
but it is there it's just that when I

7475.52 --> 7479.900000000001
think back to my life it's like that

7477.5 --> 7482.179
part is like it's kind of like not

7479.9 --> 7486.98
really been a part of it I locked it off

7482.179 --> 7489.86
because I just this stopped engaging and

7486.98 --> 7491.959999999999
yeah got a new life went to school in a

7489.86 --> 7494.179
different region

7491.96 --> 7497.38
because I went to school in that region

7494.179 --> 7497.38
where that [ __ ] would happen

7498.08 --> 7503.659
then we went to another school like

7501.199 --> 7506.119
which is way out of its way it's like it

7503.659 --> 7509.299999999999
it was like

7506.119 --> 7512.799999999999
uh what is it 15 kilometers away instead

7509.3 --> 7512.8
of like three four

7513.619 --> 7518.839999999999
quite out of the way and that was like

7516.08 --> 7521.179
getting to know all kinds of new people

7518.84 --> 7522.02
different people it was more challenging

7521.179 --> 7523.9400000000005
even

7522.02 --> 7526.400000000001
because it was like the Waldorf School

7523.94 --> 7528.138999999999
where now God and those kids were

7526.4 --> 7530.619
relentless

7528.139 --> 7533.4800000000005
but they were not like

7530.619 --> 7535.639
demonic they were not like secretly

7533.48 --> 7538.879999999999
really [ __ ] criminal and they were

7535.639 --> 7540.08
just mean they were just mean mean ass

7538.88 --> 7543.38
kids

7540.08 --> 7545.84
but they were yeah they were not

7543.38 --> 7551.1990000000005
criminal they were very not Criminal

7545.84 --> 7551.1990000000005
and very tidy in ways but just so mean

7551.239 --> 7555.0199999999995
so that was the challenge that I got

7553.04 --> 7557.06
into then and I kind of forgot about all

7555.02 --> 7559.780000000001
that other garbage

7557.06 --> 7559.780000000001
that happened

7562.099 --> 7566.719
it's a new challenge to face

7564.92 --> 7568.58
it was much more challenging much more

7566.719 --> 7571.4
upfront I mean it was like a military

7568.58 --> 7573.8
school to me sometimes like the

7571.4 --> 7575.36
experience of it to me was like I'm

7573.8 --> 7578.0
going through military school where like

7575.36 --> 7580.159
everybody's continually like

7578.0 --> 7584.719
trying to catch you off guard trying to

7580.159 --> 7587.119
[ __ ] with you like continually it was

7584.719 --> 7589.639
maddening and they did it with other

7587.119 --> 7592.639
kits too brutally

7589.639 --> 7594.679
brutally like some with some like even

7592.639 --> 7597.32
worse than with myself because they

7594.679 --> 7599.4800000000005
weren't defensive

7597.32 --> 7601.759999999999
they were just like kind of weaken and

7599.48 --> 7604.759999999999
didn't know what to do really sad

7601.76 --> 7607.219
they would bully them even worse because

7604.76 --> 7609.5
with me I got just really emotional

7607.219 --> 7611.78
really hurt but I would also get vicious

7609.5 --> 7614.599
if they try anything more

7611.78 --> 7615.86
they knew that like I would punch you in

7614.599 --> 7617.54
the [ __ ] face

7615.86 --> 7622.179
those other kids wouldn't even punch

7617.54 --> 7622.179
back at all really sad to behold

7626.599 --> 7629.0
um

7627.679 --> 7632.2390000000005
so yeah

7629.0 --> 7635.9
it was still I learned enormous amounts

7632.239 --> 7638.239
from it and even in that in that school

7635.9 --> 7640.58
and with fellow students I also got

7638.239 --> 7643.4
confronted with like Flat Earth

7640.58 --> 7645.0199999999995
and stuff and it was really weird like I

7643.4 --> 7647.48
got a confronted with flat Earth and

7645.02 --> 7649.820000000001
then in years later

7647.48 --> 7651.98
it's really crazy years later it's like

7649.82 --> 7656.78
they all forgot and suddenly it was all

7651.98 --> 7660.138999999999
a globe the same [ __ ] kids

7656.78 --> 7661.699
first they bullied me with how it was in

7660.139 --> 7663.92
the globe

7661.699 --> 7666.86
and then it was flat and then years

7663.92 --> 7669.679
later now they suddenly were like super

7666.86 --> 7671.179
all about the globe and how I how dare I

7669.679 --> 7673.6990000000005
say that it isn't

7671.179 --> 7675.86
like what the [ __ ] man what the [ __ ]

7673.699 --> 7677.719
it's like no matter what I say they just

7675.86 --> 7680.32
say the opposite that's what that felt

7677.719 --> 7680.32
like back then

7693.92 --> 7697.28
anyway

7695.12 --> 7700.88
[Music]

7697.28 --> 7704.86
ah we're past two hour mark

7700.88 --> 7704.86
let's see how far I can take this thing

7707.239 --> 7711.799999999999
please support my show through PayPal by

7709.76 --> 7715.3
the way that would be great

7711.8 --> 7715.3
hope it's been interesting

7747.26 --> 7751.46
okay uh seems like you guys have been

7750.02 --> 7752.530000000001
talking about something completely

7751.46 --> 7759.049
different

7752.53 --> 7759.049
[Music]

7762.56 --> 7769.09
[Music]

7771.58 --> 7776.9
populations forever

7774.619 --> 7779.78
I miss that

7776.9 --> 7781.699
could what be because the population is

7779.78 --> 7783.88
so dense and it isn't really dense at

7781.699 --> 7783.879999999999
all

7790.88 --> 7797.36
tired of the Geisha I wasn't even

7793.099 --> 7799.82
talking about the gay subject anymore

7797.36 --> 7803.139
the [ __ ] I was just talking about

7799.82 --> 7803.139
bullying in school

7814.94 --> 7819.98
what

7816.98 --> 7819.98
what

7820.88 --> 7826.78
okay Bluetooth yeah but what is that

7823.639 --> 7826.78
supposed to prove though

7829.82 --> 7834.32
it just proves the sun is an optical

7831.92 --> 7837.76
effect

7834.32 --> 7837.759999999999
that's what it proves

7838.04 --> 7840.94
and the horizon

7841.56 --> 7845.77
[Music]

7847.28 --> 7851.32
being told yeah being tall helps

7859.699 --> 7865.239
yeah I was

7861.44 --> 7865.239
never the shortest but

7868.639 --> 7873.56
like people didn't bully me for people

7871.28 --> 7875.719
bullied me because I was so freaking

7873.56 --> 7878.780000000001
sensitive and I would always respond

7875.719 --> 7883.719
with feelings to everything

7878.78 --> 7883.719
and they thought that was gay about me

7884.239 --> 7889.4
they literally like

7886.52 --> 7892.040000000001
they even told me like they didn't want

7889.4 --> 7894.619
me to have those feelings they literally

7892.04 --> 7896.42
it's I felt threatened at times that

7894.619 --> 7897.92
they actually were trying to get me

7896.42 --> 7899.96
lobotomized

7897.92 --> 7902.4800000000005
because they didn't want me to have

7899.96 --> 7904.159
feelings literally they told me that

7902.48 --> 7906.0199999999995
sometimes

7904.159 --> 7909.5199999999995
because they just thought I was in the

7906.02 --> 7909.52
way with that all the time

7920.3 --> 7924.820000000001
yeah honestly an openness from here but

7922.159 --> 7924.82
yeah thank you

7931.52 --> 7937.34
this also for me functional to like

7934.099 --> 7940.04
reconstruct it all

7937.34 --> 7942.92
because it's been a long time like in my

7940.04 --> 7945.5
20s I hate it

7942.92 --> 7947.719
my early teens and pre-teens like I

7945.5 --> 7949.58
hated it so much I had nothing but like

7947.719 --> 7951.38
hatred

7949.58 --> 7953.78
that I felt I wouldn't even remember

7951.38 --> 7956.900000000001
anything I would just remember hatred

7953.78 --> 7959.0
it's like I hated it and I didn't know

7956.9 --> 7960.98
anything about it I even like avoided

7959.0 --> 7964.639
thinking about it because all I ever

7960.98 --> 7967.94
felt was just humiliation and pain

7964.639 --> 7971.06
all the time when I thought back to that

7967.94 --> 7974.659
so going through it now and actually

7971.06 --> 7978.820000000001
trying to reconstruct it is being very

7974.659 --> 7978.82
helpful to basically restore

7979.34 --> 7985.159000000001
the overall picture

7982.28 --> 7988.78
and thus also understanding better how

7985.159 --> 7988.78
how I got to this point

7992.65 --> 7995.728999999999
[Music]

8012.46 --> 8015.88
Did You Know by the way that I've

8014.26 --> 8018.76
actually watched

8015.88 --> 8021.04
like a in the Dark World a whole video

8018.76 --> 8023.7390000000005
recording of me explaining everything

8021.04 --> 8027.219
about my past

8023.739 --> 8029.919999999999
that lasted like hours

8027.219 --> 8031.9
it was like a summary of like even the

8029.92 --> 8034.119
things that I'm saying now like I

8031.9 --> 8036.339999999999
remember having seen that from a first

8034.119 --> 8038.38
person perspective

8036.34 --> 8041.6990000000005
basically listening to myself and

8038.38 --> 8041.6990000000005
describe things about my past

8041.86 --> 8046.839999999999
from the future

8044.139 --> 8051.36
isn't that just interesting apparently

8046.84 --> 8051.360000000001
that stuff is really easy to do

8051.46 --> 8057.82
it's incredibly hard to look through the

8054.76 --> 8059.4400000000005
future in your visions and then learn

8057.82 --> 8062.0199999999995
actually about something that's

8059.44 --> 8064.719
happening then in the future

8062.02 --> 8067.780000000001
but in the if you in the future talk

8064.719 --> 8071.92
about the past then that is something

8067.78 --> 8075.159
that apparently is very attainable

8071.92 --> 8076.599
in like without triggering the Cassandra

8075.159 --> 8078.82
effect

8076.599 --> 8082.3
isn't that interesting yeah you're

8078.82 --> 8085.239
literally getting like time travel based

8082.3 --> 8087.219
mechanical lore here from practical

8085.239 --> 8088.9
experience okay

8087.219 --> 8091.679
it's not a lot of places on the internet

8088.9 --> 8091.679
you get that

8098.38 --> 8103.1990000000005
PayPal now

8100.01 --> 8103.1990000000005
[Music]

8111.699 --> 8114.699
foreign

8127.8 --> 8131.52
silence why not

8131.8 --> 8137.4400000000005
oh there's a [ __ ]

8135.28 --> 8139.239
maybe in a couple of years you'll figure

8137.44 --> 8142.44
it out

8139.239 --> 8142.44
what this all meant

8144.9 --> 8152.739
and hey if if anything it'll probably be

8148.48 --> 8154.9
very useful lore after you're dead

8152.739 --> 8158.0199999999995
because you're probably gonna be dealing

8154.9 --> 8162.0
with like trying travel based situations

8158.02 --> 8162.0
there in spirit form

8164.079 --> 8169.42
so I'm I'm potentially giving you heads

8167.32 --> 8173.04
up skills for the afterlife here

8169.42 --> 8173.04
whatever it may be

8178.48 --> 8184.239
do you guys think about such things

8181.179 --> 8187.679
probably not

8184.239 --> 8187.678999999999
maybe LSG does

8201.099 --> 8204.78
man this green is really

8205.059 --> 8207.84
heavy

8218.439 --> 8220.979000000001
right

8262.559 --> 8271.74
yep I am broke right now

8266.8 --> 8271.74
I could certainly use PayPal support

8278.92 --> 8284.399
award for most unique logical audience

8281.26 --> 8284.399
on the internet goes to

8284.92 --> 8292.32
me snap

8288.099 --> 8292.32
well I'd like to be included I mean

8303.219 --> 8309.039999999999
at least I know I'm one of the people

8306.399 --> 8310.479
online that is probably the most

8309.04 --> 8313.679
explicable

8310.479 --> 8316.199999999999
the the best at explaining

8313.679 --> 8319.24
really complex

8316.2 --> 8321.76
surreal and even drug related

8319.24 --> 8324.46
experiences

8321.76 --> 8326.979
I know I'm the best at that I can go

8324.46 --> 8329.38
into like really fine detail that would

8326.979 --> 8331.779999999999
match Rudolph Steiner

8329.38 --> 8334.66
in how detailed he can get

8331.78 --> 8336.939
and be explicable that's always been my

8334.66 --> 8338.5
mission because there's endless amounts

8336.939 --> 8340.24
of information

8338.5 --> 8342.219
yeah endless

8340.24 --> 8344.26
that's a thing that literally never

8342.219 --> 8346.419999999998
ending yeah there's maybe a limited

8344.26 --> 8348.519
amount of volume available for matter to

8346.42 --> 8351.639
exist in but the amount of information

8348.519 --> 8352.84
is literally endless here's the problem

8351.639 --> 8356.559
though

8352.84 --> 8358.12
can you made it to be understood

8356.559 --> 8360.82
yeah

8358.12 --> 8362.679
that's the problem and it's always the

8360.82 --> 8365.92
problem because you can have whatever

8362.679 --> 8368.08
magnificent idea but if like

8365.92 --> 8370.719000000001
three quarters of all the subtle

8368.08 --> 8374.08
intricacies are completely lost because

8370.719 --> 8376.839999999998
nobody even has any reflection to that

8374.08 --> 8378.58
level so they don't even see it then

8376.84 --> 8379.78
what's the point in trying to explain it

8378.58 --> 8382.0
to them

8379.78 --> 8385.179
you see

8382.0 --> 8387.76
so for me it's like a live mission

8385.179 --> 8389.8
to make things

8387.76 --> 8392.5
explicable

8389.8 --> 8395.08
to make sure that I can communicate

8392.5 --> 8397.6
things that are really complicated in a

8395.08 --> 8400.12
way that no matter where you are with

8397.6 --> 8402.58
your Consciousness in your life

8400.12 --> 8405.640000000001
however far you've gotten that you will

8402.58 --> 8408.039999999999
be able to have a grasp on it and grow

8405.64 --> 8410.199999999999
it subtly from that

8408.04 --> 8412.78
vantage point

8410.2 --> 8414.460000000001
and later more you'll get back to

8412.78 --> 8416.02
watching it and you'll see like whoa I

8414.46 --> 8418.0
thought of it like this but now I see

8416.02 --> 8420.28
all this and this and this on top

8418.0 --> 8422.8
and then years later you might even take

8420.28 --> 8425.140000000001
a look back and see again like whoa we

8422.8 --> 8427.72
even saw that part

8425.14 --> 8430.56
that I now also got and that's kind of

8427.72 --> 8430.56
what I'm hoping for

8431.8 --> 8438.599999999999
because I want my insights to land the

8435.1 --> 8438.6
test the time the

8443.5 --> 8447.399
to survive

8445.6 --> 8450.16
the test of time

8447.399 --> 8451.599999999999
kind of like Rudolph Steiner's inside

8450.16 --> 8453.76
has

8451.6 --> 8455.56
mean it's over 100 years old and it's

8453.76 --> 8457.54
still freaking brilliant

8455.56 --> 8460.6
it's just so much of it

8457.54 --> 8463.18
and it is like it is like a soup

8460.6 --> 8466.0
but man once you start to realize how

8463.18 --> 8470.28
that soup Works it's incredible it's

8466.0 --> 8470.28
like this pool of fluid inside

8470.7 --> 8477.52
and I I try to do it like that

8474.399 --> 8479.74
in a way right I'm weaving a pattern and

8477.52 --> 8482.1
it's about you being able to follow the

8479.74 --> 8482.1
pattern

8486.399 --> 8489.72
that's my focus

8498.58 --> 8505.42
all the flaps trying to catch up yeah

8502.359 --> 8508.18
but you're doing fine though

8505.42 --> 8510.16
and hey if if you feel like you're not

8508.18 --> 8512.62
doing too great catching up well then

8510.16 --> 8515.039999999999
you can compensate by donating to my

8512.62 --> 8515.04
PayPal

8519.88 --> 8525.64
and it has a practical mechanism in how

8523.0 --> 8528.16
that actually works though because it's

8525.64 --> 8531.039999999999
not just a joke to make you throw money

8528.16 --> 8533.02
at me even though I really need it but

8531.04 --> 8535.84
it also does work because if you support

8533.02 --> 8538.720000000001
me I will keep you closer

8535.84 --> 8543.6
in my attention I do that actual

8538.72 --> 8543.599999999999
supporters get my long-term attention

8544.12 --> 8549.76
and then includes extra effort to make

8547.12 --> 8554.1
anything explicable

8549.76 --> 8554.1
if there's any obstacles left

8554.14 --> 8556.92
you see

8557.02 --> 8562.359
so yeah donating to my PayPal is

8559.72 --> 8565.42
actually worth it and it also in general

8562.359 --> 8569.52
makes me more forgiving to any goofiness

8565.42 --> 8569.52
that you might display typically

8569.74 --> 8573.899
it is true that is what it is

8579.359 --> 8585.1
right now of course

8582.16 --> 8586.78
you can definitely without

8585.1 --> 8592.26
supporting me

8586.78 --> 8592.26
still grow and be very much appreciated

8594.28 --> 8599.5
as well most of you have not everybody

8596.74 --> 8601.479
here supports me that's in my chat but I

8599.5 --> 8603.58
still very much appreciate your presence

8601.479 --> 8606.039999999999
here

8603.58 --> 8609.76
and everywhere else too

8606.04 --> 8612.7
you because you are also well my eyes

8609.76 --> 8615.16
and ears anyways you keep a look out of

8612.7 --> 8616.720000000001
what's going on in other chats

8615.16 --> 8619.14
because I'm not always hanging around

8616.72 --> 8619.14
those

8619.42 --> 8625.06
so I get to hear if somebody said

8622.06 --> 8628.24
something shitty about me or whatever

8625.06 --> 8630.699999999999
or if the place is all talking [ __ ]

8628.24 --> 8632.56
about me and and everybody's okay with

8630.7 --> 8635.439
that that I get to hear about that

8632.56 --> 8638.92
thanks to your

8635.439 --> 8640.899
yours yeah your social support your your

8638.92 --> 8644.14
action support

8640.899 --> 8646.479
your loyalty you can say

8644.14 --> 8648.66
right so that's also valuable to me of

8646.479 --> 8648.66
course

8649.96 --> 8654.58
and I it helps a lot

8652.24 --> 8655.78
and on top of that it's also very

8654.58 --> 8658.18
comforting

8655.78 --> 8660.04
because I do at times just feel real

8658.18 --> 8662.14
alone when there's like a whole group of

8660.04 --> 8664.12
people talking [ __ ] about me again right

8662.14 --> 8667.24
because it's not the first time that

8664.12 --> 8671.399000000001
literally used to happen in me in school

8667.24 --> 8673.84
I like a whole like 20 people

8671.399 --> 8677.08
simultaneously would start singing a

8673.84 --> 8678.399
song that's humiliating to me about me

8677.08 --> 8681.76
yeah

8678.399 --> 8683.08
that happened all the time

8681.76 --> 8685.359
so

8683.08 --> 8687.16
if there's somebody that actually is

8685.359 --> 8689.439
willing to say like hey

8687.16 --> 8691.6
you shouldn't talk like that that's like

8689.439 --> 8696.28
really mean right

8691.6 --> 8699.1
like bet never happened

8696.28 --> 8701.68
when I was young yeah nobody would do

8699.1 --> 8705.04
that nobody would be like hey stop this

8701.68 --> 8707.68
yeah so we have no idea how fulfilling

8705.04 --> 8709.300000000001
it is when I see shitty things like that

8707.68 --> 8712.960000000001
happen and people suddenly in a chat

8709.3 --> 8714.88
like hey this is really nasty like you

8712.96 --> 8718.599999999999
should like he doesn't deserve that that

8714.88 --> 8721.599999999999
is incredibly heartwarming to me because

8718.6 --> 8724.12
I never got that nobody ever did that

8721.6 --> 8725.979000000001
when I was young nobody ever stuck up

8724.12 --> 8727.300000000001
for me when everybody was [ __ ] on me

8725.979 --> 8732.699999999999
as a group

8727.3 --> 8735.34
so it's really very fulfilling

8732.7 --> 8737.819000000001
that that you guys also do that that you

8735.34 --> 8742.5
actually stick up for me publicly

8737.819 --> 8742.5
outspokenly that means a lot to me

8749.92 --> 8752.460000000001
what

8752.74 --> 8759.58
yeah kids can be very easily influenced

8756.939 --> 8760.960000000001
just in general by good or evil they

8759.58 --> 8763.24
don't really know the difference too

8760.96 --> 8764.979
much they get a feel for it but they

8763.24 --> 8767.26
don't really know the long-term

8764.979 --> 8771.88
implications they don't know

8767.26 --> 8773.380000000001
how it sets your direction

8771.88 --> 8775.839999999998
when you're really young you don't

8773.38 --> 8778.119999999999
really know that evil is really has

8775.84 --> 8781.06
long-term consequences

8778.12 --> 8783.399000000001
you don't really understand that

8781.06 --> 8785.08
you just get the short-term feel of it

8783.399 --> 8787.899
and then you don't like it or something

8785.08 --> 8789.939
right or you think it's ugly but you

8787.899 --> 8791.319
don't really understand the long-term

8789.939 --> 8793.42
consequences

8791.319 --> 8796.119999999999
and so you're more easily seduced

8793.42 --> 8797.92
because of your lack of wisdom

8796.12 --> 8801.58
so yeah

8797.92 --> 8803.8
targeted constantly as a kid right

8801.58 --> 8806.14
all through school damn yeah so you got

8803.8 --> 8809.819
you probably got very similar

8806.14 --> 8809.819
experiences I did in my color

8810.52 --> 8814.62
maybe in this in a different style

8815.74 --> 8819.28
but yeah

8817.66 --> 8821.619999999999
it's brutal

8819.28 --> 8823.54
when it happens and you're gonna have to

8821.62 --> 8825.880000000001
work through it through the rest of your

8823.54 --> 8826.720000000001
life but you can get a lot of good out

8825.88 --> 8829.0
of it

8826.72 --> 8830.438999999998
because it was also just a big challenge

8829.0 --> 8833.5
that you had to work through and

8830.439 --> 8836.439
anything that challenges you also

8833.5 --> 8839.26
forces you to grow right remember

8836.439 --> 8840.34
how I started about talking about that

8839.26 --> 8843.399
thank you

8840.34 --> 8845.439
is it an hour ago

8843.399 --> 8849.06
it's all good everything has a purpose

8845.439 --> 8849.06
including the bad things

8849.1 --> 8856.42
just don't make the bad things worse

8851.74 --> 8858.699999999999
right realize that bad things happen

8856.42 --> 8861.939
with a good outcome

8858.7 --> 8865.319000000001
just don't add to the bad

8861.939 --> 8865.319
and things will be all right

8866.72 --> 8869.75
[Music]

8873.28 --> 8881.979000000001
you've been ugly all your life

8876.7 --> 8883.54
okay really is it that bad Godzilla

8881.979 --> 8885.88
Well you certainly have seemed to

8883.54 --> 8888.28
compensate it with like a playful

8885.88 --> 8890.56
character for that which is really

8888.28 --> 8892.479000000001
effective by the way I mean a lot of

8890.56 --> 8893.979
really ugly people also can become

8892.479 --> 8896.74
really funny

8893.979 --> 8898.24
and then they're very much appreciated

8896.74 --> 8900.699999999999
even though they're very ugly because

8898.24 --> 8902.5
they're so funny so yeah there's all

8900.7 --> 8904.54
kinds of ways of dealing with actually

8902.5 --> 8908.22
being really ugly

8904.54 --> 8908.220000000001
it was a blessing what

8909.58 --> 8915.3
oh okay

8911.859 --> 8915.300000000001
well there you go

8919.3 --> 8924.519999999999
yeah pecking order freaking pecking

8922.0 --> 8928.54
order and I was I was

8924.52 --> 8930.359
I grew pretty quickly it's like I got to

8928.54 --> 8933.660000000002
my teen size

8930.359 --> 8933.66
relatively Young

8934.479 --> 8939.519999999999
but then as I actually like it was

8937.42 --> 8941.38
around 12 then everybody else kept

8939.52 --> 8943.54
growing and growing and I didn't and it

8941.38 --> 8945.819
was really like

8943.54 --> 8947.380000000001
I really wish I'd become like two meters

8945.819 --> 8949.479
tall or something that would have been

8947.38 --> 8951.479
awesome but it wasn't meant to be it's

8949.479 --> 8955.619999999999
just

8951.479 --> 8955.619999999999
174 and that's it

8957.939 --> 8963.58
but I'm still

8959.58 --> 8966.479
decently brought showing at least

8963.58 --> 8966.479
that's something

8974.52 --> 8980.399000000001
and secure but oh that's awesome

8976.78 --> 8980.399000000001
Godzilla well that's great

8994.84 --> 8999.18
wow nice Godzilla good and you man

9000.359 --> 9002.899000000001
foreign

9022.5 --> 9028.859
yes yes Marco yeah I know what you mean

9025.38 --> 9031.819
I mean beautiful people I mean I'd hire

9028.859 --> 9031.819
beautiful people

9032.28 --> 9037.04
right

9033.899 --> 9037.039999999999
if they were like

9039.66 --> 9044.039999999999
yeah that they would suppress their

9042.12 --> 9046.2
ugliness it's like yeah beautiful people

9044.04 --> 9049.140000000001
are great but they have to be in their

9046.2 --> 9050.640000000001
role they have to actually like want to

9049.14 --> 9052.08
be

9050.64 --> 9054.72
beautiful

9052.08 --> 9057.42
like that because a lot of them are kind

9054.72 --> 9059.179999999998
of like have just demonic Tendencies and

9057.42 --> 9061.319
[ __ ] and hey

9059.18 --> 9064.319
to be fair

9061.319 --> 9065.519999999999
I know what that's like

9064.319 --> 9067.08
because

9065.52 --> 9070.26
so do I

9067.08 --> 9074.539999999999
as you know is like I've got that thing

9070.26 --> 9074.54
in there I've got the rage and

9077.22 --> 9082.679999999998
and a lot of beautiful people do

9080.76 --> 9084.42
and it would be great if they just

9082.68 --> 9087.42
learned to deal with it more

9084.42 --> 9089.34
constructively I actually tried to do

9087.42 --> 9091.979
that like go through a bit of a learning

9089.34 --> 9095.939
period with my ex like that on my ex is

9091.979 --> 9097.019999999999
freaking gorgeous but she also had that

9095.939 --> 9102.06
that

9097.02 --> 9105.0
monster inside and hers was like really

9102.06 --> 9106.979
Savage like not in like she would never

9105.0 --> 9110.16
make it do anything but it was like

9106.979 --> 9114.38
really dark about her

9110.16 --> 9114.38
and that was very saddening

9115.979 --> 9121.019999999999
because she would she basically refused

9118.14 --> 9122.939
to tame her demon as I have

9121.02 --> 9125.28
she just wouldn't do it

9122.939 --> 9126.78
she couldn't do it and also she had

9125.28 --> 9128.819000000001
things in her past and [ __ ] I'm not

9126.78 --> 9132.0
gonna talk about it so that probably

9128.819 --> 9134.18
just prevented her from going along with

9132.0 --> 9134.18
me

9134.46 --> 9137.3
with that

9152.04 --> 9156.960000000001
but yeah beautiful people can be amazing

9154.56 --> 9162.26
but not if they're like really vapid

9156.96 --> 9162.259999999998
that's [ __ ] aggravating when they are

9178.88 --> 9183.979
all right LSG that's hilarious

9218.28 --> 9221.28
foreign

9221.899 --> 9226.039999999999
towards rounding out the show though

9232.38 --> 9236.119999999999
for two and a half hours

9238.46 --> 9242.839999999998
do you do better by the way it's

9243.12 --> 9250.34
in the last few days it's been really

9245.78 --> 9250.34
nagging but it's getting a bit better

9250.399 --> 9256.34
yes

9252.18 --> 9256.34
yes watch it live

9256.5 --> 9260.12
it was a very long one

9282.24 --> 9285.02
hmm

9286.56 --> 9291.96
yeah that's cool that's a that's a good

9289.14 --> 9294.439
place to be at Godzilla glad it worked

9291.96 --> 9294.438999999998
out for you

9302.819 --> 9308.3
seems nice for the bit kooky yeah well

9305.58 --> 9308.3
she is a bit

9309.02 --> 9313.319000000001
flustered you could say an insecure

9311.76 --> 9314.34
especially in the beginning gets better

9313.319 --> 9316.5
though

9314.34 --> 9318.359
so it's like it feels to me like oh

9316.5 --> 9320.819
she's kind of trying to do what I do

9318.359 --> 9324.26
except not being that good at it but

9320.819 --> 9324.26
that's still pretty good at it

9329.28 --> 9333.960000000001
and she is a I don't know she's like a

9331.92 --> 9338.84
bit of a witchy

9333.96 --> 9338.839999999998
hippie style person like that

9339.42 --> 9342.68
the way how she does it

9346.319 --> 9352.979
right was the hair was so light

9349.28 --> 9356.04
yeah well when I was a little kid I had

9352.979 --> 9358.38
like very light blonde hair too when I

9356.04 --> 9363.060000000001
was like when I was like

9358.38 --> 9366.06
between three and six

9363.06 --> 9369.199999999999
then around six it it started to turn

9366.06 --> 9369.199999999999
more darker around

9370.38 --> 9376.5
and my brother's hair was like white

9373.92 --> 9378.24
I was like he was but he is like he is

9376.5 --> 9381.2
more natural blonde

9378.24 --> 9381.199999999999
compared to me

9381.68 --> 9389.1
it was always like this

9385.74 --> 9391.14
this darker brown type color it's never

9389.1 --> 9392.880000000001
changed by the way it's it's this ever

9391.14 --> 9394.68
since I was six I got this color hair

9392.88 --> 9398.119999999999
it's never changed

9394.68 --> 9398.12
it hasn't grayed up either

9425.42 --> 9430.74
I think a lot of kids have it when

9428.7 --> 9432.0
they're really young they get like a

9430.74 --> 9434.939
blonde

9432.0 --> 9438.06
they have like the Proto blondishness to

9434.939 --> 9442.02
them and then when they get older it

9438.06 --> 9444.979
it settles more in the real color

9442.02 --> 9444.979000000001
it's kind of weird

9457.92 --> 9460.460000000001
right

9479.28 --> 9484.74
