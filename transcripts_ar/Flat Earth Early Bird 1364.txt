98.88 --> 106.32
like this gray haze everywhere

no clear sky anywhere even some really

106.32 --> 111.439
big clouds but they've been at a

distance so far

111.92 --> 115.60000000000001

211.12 --> 214.56
but it would have been like been it

212.879 --> 217.67999999999998
would have been just very nitpicky

214.56 --> 219.28
anyway it wasn't worth breaking into it

217.68 --> 224.20000000000002
but

219.28 --> 224.2

yeah

382.08 --> 387.75899999999996
like almost like gi joe but not

387.759 --> 391.84000000000003
dramatics

389.28 --> 391.84
what did

392.639 --> 396.56
it's weird it's just a movie from a very

394.8 --> 398.479
different time i mean you would never

396.56 --> 400.88
see anything like that roll out of

398.479 --> 403.36
hollywood right now

400.88 --> 405.68
not like that

403.36 --> 407.84000000000003
but it was interesting

405.68 --> 411.68
i've never seen that before not that i

407.84 --> 411.67999999999995
could remember anyway huh

419.03 --> 423.75
[Music]

425.199 --> 429.28000000000003
i mean the characters were very

426.88 --> 431.44
interesting

429.28 --> 434.0
and you did

431.44 --> 435.28
mostly like believe that was actually

434.0 --> 438.96
sort of real

435.28 --> 438.96
they did get really in character

439.52 --> 442.08
so yeah

442.88 --> 448.639
yeah donald sutherland was

446.56 --> 452.24
waist was like very

448.639 --> 452.24
trippy suave in it

454.479 --> 462.52
it's almost like wow he's like a hippie

456.88 --> 462.52

462.68 --> 468.96
[Music]

[Music]

481.28 --> 485.35999999999996
right i think that pretty much sums it

483.199 --> 485.36
up

486.72 --> 490.639
that's pretty much everything i did

488.16 --> 490.639
yesterday

491.28 --> 494.79999999999995
flatters debate

492.72 --> 498.639
after show lasted long conversation

494.8 --> 498.639
after the after show lasted long

499.36 --> 501.68
uh

504.08 --> 508.87899999999996
went to catch up on a few videos and

506.319 --> 512.16
then jim bob

508.879 --> 512.16
and then i watched that movie

514.88 --> 521.479
so yeah that that's it

517.039 --> 521.479
that was my day yesterday and

523.919 --> 528.959
i need to kind of like get myself to eat

526.56 --> 528.959
again

530.48 --> 536.24
i keep skipping dinner i shouldn't do

532.72 --> 538.88
that like at the actual dinner because

536.24 --> 541.279
just eating french fries is not

538.88 --> 541.279
dinner

546.08 --> 550.08
but yeah it's it's also like the time of

548.24 --> 552.32
the year i didn't typically get that

550.08 --> 554.64
issue then i'm like

552.32 --> 556.32
and then i just don't want to eat

554.64 --> 558.399
it's weird

556.32 --> 560.08
but i should

558.399 --> 563.839
anyway

560.08 --> 563.839
how are you guys doing

565.519 --> 569.839
by the way i checked my comment section

567.6 --> 571.839
again this morning from yesterday's show

569.839 --> 574.8000000000001
and

571.839 --> 579.2
the trolls were not amused

574.8 --> 581.3599999999999
they were like seething angry

579.2 --> 583.279
and like spamming even i had to delete a

581.36 --> 585.519
whole bunch of it

583.279 --> 588.16
because it was just like cluttering

585.519 --> 590.8
negativity unbelievable

588.16 --> 594.399
this

590.8 --> 598.0799999999999
for some reason i just really

594.399 --> 598.08
get the worst out of these people

598.32 --> 603.279
i mean out there like even with brian

600.88 --> 606.08
all that he gets a lot of like

603.279 --> 609.36
nerd trolls which is expected that just

606.08 --> 611.279
give out these stupid puzzles to confuse

609.36 --> 612.24
the [ __ ] out of you

611.279 --> 614.24
and

612.24 --> 616.9590000000001
they don't really do that in my chat too

614.24 --> 618.72
much i mean there's a couple and there i

616.959 --> 620.2399999999999
find it actually kind of entertaining

618.72 --> 622.0
they'll at least

620.24 --> 623.92
give some proof that they actually

622.0 --> 625.68
watched what i was talking about and

623.92 --> 627.279
listen

625.68 --> 629.76
and then they might challenge me on

627.279 --> 631.519
something like stone monkey

629.76 --> 633.68
but there's a lot of them out there that

631.519 --> 637.04
are just nasty

633.68 --> 637.04
nasty people

637.6 --> 642.32
and they always keep coming back

640.8 --> 644.8389999999999
like

642.32 --> 648.5600000000001
since i started this channel it's

644.839 --> 648.5600000000001
yeah anyway

656.079 --> 659.079

674.16 --> 677.8389999999999
stuff

675.6 --> 677.839
huh

682.32 --> 685.519
adamant

683.92 --> 686.88
so was it like a test flight or

685.519 --> 690.48
something

686.88 --> 690.48
or was it an actual launch

691.6 --> 695.5600000000001

equipment it was

777.92 --> 780.92
uh

807.76 --> 810.76

851.76 --> 854.8389999999999

854.839 --> 860.5600000000001

catastrophic engine failure

895.279 --> 898.279
okay

904.32 --> 906.88
what the

909.199 --> 912.8
that

910.0 --> 913.76
looked really weird

912.8 --> 916.4799999999999
i mean

913.76 --> 921.24
fire came out of the top directly under

916.48 --> 921.24
the capsule like what the hell

926.24 --> 930.32
and then they just switch to the one

927.92 --> 932.24
with the parachutes

930.32 --> 935.519
was that a live recording probably not

932.24 --> 935.519
right was edited down

935.92 --> 938.92
hmm

946.0 --> 948.72
right okay so

947.68 --> 950.959
cool

948.72 --> 950.9590000000001
but

953.279 --> 957.8389999999999
do you know anything about more details

955.519 --> 962.079
about what it was supposed to be doing

957.839 --> 962.0790000000001
with the scientific equipment

964.72 --> 967.72

[Music]

1012.0 --> 1017.97
yeah yeah i guess so terminoid

1015.279 --> 1020.16

1017.97 --> 1023.32
[Music]

1020.16 --> 1023.3199999999999
or something

1026.72 --> 1032.1200000000001
time to disappoint a whole bunch of

1028.319 --> 1032.12
dreamers out there

1058.88 --> 1063.3600000000001
right i'll show you

1060.799 --> 1067.039
just a short

1063.36 --> 1070.7199999999998
few seconds of it

1067.039 --> 1070.72
so you can at least have a picture

1072.4 --> 1075.4
right

1082.64 --> 1086.4
see

1084.08 --> 1088.799
that's like against the capsule i mean

1086.4 --> 1090.88
that bottom of that capsule should be

1088.799 --> 1095.6399999999999
like toasty

1090.88 --> 1095.64
and blackened and all that at least

1113.2 --> 1119.0800000000002
space junk crash in your head up here

1116.08 --> 1119.08
what

1123.99 --> 1131.92
[Music]

1142.59 --> 1148.6399999999999
[Music]

1145.12 --> 1148.6399999999999

1149.2 --> 1155.6000000000001
what something crashed

1151.44 --> 1155.6000000000001
on your place or something like what

1163.36 --> 1166.8799999999999
but lucky it wasn't shattered

1167.84 --> 1173.039
yeah but obviously as

1170.48 --> 1176.48
pjc net at least hinted at it was

1173.039 --> 1179.039
supposedly some kind of technical

1176.48 --> 1180.64
thingy flight although he hasn't really

1179.039 --> 1183.96
elaborated

1180.64 --> 1183.96
about it

1194.24 --> 1197.24

1246.48 --> 1251.28
say about it i mean

1249.28 --> 1253.6789999999999
like obviously all this

1251.28 --> 1255.12
space launch stuff is completely

1253.679 --> 1257.2800000000002
pointless

1255.12 --> 1260.7199999999998
when it comes to actual space travel

1257.28 --> 1264.32
because that place doesn't exist

1260.72 --> 1266.32
although yeah it is fascinating and

1264.32 --> 1269.6789999999999
just

1266.32 --> 1269.6789999999999
it is entertaining

1269.919 --> 1273.679
to some degree although it's also

1271.679 --> 1275.8400000000001
incredibly boring

1273.679 --> 1277.8400000000001
yeah

1275.84 --> 1280.9599999999998
still it's like the technological side

1277.84 --> 1280.9599999999998
of it it's like yeah

1281.47 --> 1286.08
[Music]

1283.84 --> 1288.1589999999999
it's the one plus of the giant waste of

1286.08 --> 1291.12
money

1288.159 --> 1294.0800000000002
and all the propaganda delusion

1291.12 --> 1296.559
is yeah you get to see some

1294.08 --> 1296.559
rockets

1302.08 --> 1305.6399999999999
hey tony whitcomb

1325.44 --> 1330.799
okay what

1327.84 --> 1333.039
it was coming down the parachutes were

1330.799 --> 1335.76
at severe angles what

1333.039 --> 1335.76
what does that mean

1343.2 --> 1347.76
you mean they almost like got

1345.52 --> 1349.679
caught or something

1347.76 --> 1352.84
that it crashed almost is that what

1349.679 --> 1352.8400000000001
you're saying

1363.28 --> 1367.44
right i'm thinking about it it's highly

1365.679 --> 1371.2
speculative but

1367.44 --> 1373.8400000000001
maybe it's like a stunt to

1371.2 --> 1376.64
kind of demonstrate the safety of the

1373.84 --> 1378.8799999999999
ride weird right

1376.64 --> 1380.4
to show up like what would happen if it

1378.88 --> 1382.64
would go wrong then at least the

1380.4 --> 1384.159
participant in the capsule are very safe

1382.64 --> 1386.5590000000002
so they don't

1384.159 --> 1389.3600000000001
the people that might

1386.559 --> 1390.559
want to be part of this and pay big

1389.36 --> 1393.76
to do that

1390.559 --> 1398.1589999999999
that they don't get any challenger fares

1393.76 --> 1398.1589999999999
right maybe that's why this happened

1398.64 --> 1402.159
that they just want to show like oh when

1400.64 --> 1403.8400000000001
something goes wrong yeah the rocket

1402.159 --> 1406.3200000000002
will blow up but the those in the

1403.84 --> 1410.08
capsule are safe we design it the way

1406.32 --> 1412.08
that they can't get hurt right maybe

1410.08 --> 1414.559
it's supposed to be secretly

1412.08 --> 1417.6789999999999
demonstrating that

1414.559 --> 1420.3999999999999
i mean who knows

1417.679 --> 1420.4
uh yeah

1423.84 --> 1430.6399999999999
i mean the capsule got out safely

1428.08 --> 1432.0
allegedly that's all any any of that is

1430.64 --> 1435.1200000000001
real

1432.0 --> 1436.88
so yeah that is like oh yeah look you're

1435.12 --> 1440.08
safe in our capsule even if something

1436.88 --> 1443.1200000000001
goes wrong sounds like a

1440.08 --> 1444.72
a sort of advertisement really

1443.12 --> 1446.9599999999998
i don't know maybe i'm taking this too

1444.72 --> 1446.96
far

1451.36 --> 1456.559
but i mean

1452.96 --> 1456.559
i wouldn't put it past him

1456.96 --> 1460.5
bezos

1458.559 --> 1467.4189999999999
to set it up like that

1460.5 --> 1467.419
[Music]

1473.279 --> 1478.09
or it's making it more exciting for

1475.6 --> 1480.9599999999998
people to watch loss of internet what

1478.09 --> 1483.12
[Music]

1480.96 --> 1486.14
are they gonna watch it with the loss of

1483.12 --> 1489.2489999999998
internet i don't get it

1486.14 --> 1489.249
[Music]

1496.48 --> 1501.04
oh interest

1499.12 --> 1504.079
yeah sorry i misread that

1501.04 --> 1504.079
[Music]

1504.24 --> 1510.32
making it more exciting well yeah it's

1506.4 --> 1510.3200000000002
gonna draw a bit of attention right

1510.4 --> 1515.44
but also like yeah capsule got out safe

1513.6 --> 1517.84
even though the rocket blew up

1515.44 --> 1517.8400000000001
i mean

1518.0 --> 1522.799
when you look at like the

1520.48 --> 1525.039
rocket tests and all that

1522.799 --> 1528.1589999999999
from the 20th century

1525.039 --> 1532.4
usually when like yeah a rocket like

1528.159 --> 1534.0
crashed or then everybody just blew up

1532.4 --> 1535.919
right

1534.0 --> 1538.159
allegedly if they were even in that

1535.919 --> 1540.4
which is doubtful

1538.159 --> 1542.5590000000002
right but

1540.4 --> 1544.96
this is kind of a contrast to that

1542.559 --> 1547.36
because yeah the thing blew up quite

1544.96 --> 1550.799
literally big fireball

1547.36 --> 1555.7199999999998
capsule got out perfectly safe so

1550.799 --> 1555.72
that just looks like advertisement to me

1556.11 --> 1561.6399999999999
[Music]

1557.6 --> 1561.6399999999999
apollo 13 what

1561.7 --> 1570.6190000000001
[Music]

1580.48 --> 1585.84
oh

1581.52 --> 1585.84
right the movie okay dominoid

1588.799 --> 1594.6
would the g-force from a rocket launch

1591.2 --> 1594.6000000000001
kill a person

1598.24 --> 1601.1200000000001
no

1599.679 --> 1603.3600000000001
cinch man

1601.12 --> 1606.08
but

1603.36 --> 1609.4399999999998
the sheer loudness

1606.08 --> 1611.4399999999998
the explosion explosion like loudness of

1609.44 --> 1613.52
the apollo rockets

1611.44 --> 1614.559
would literally just

1613.52 --> 1618.72
kill you

1614.559 --> 1618.72
it would shatter you from the loudness

1619.919 --> 1624.48
there's a video about that

1622.32 --> 1627.76
like not made by some conspiracy

1624.48 --> 1629.1200000000001
theorists but it was like on tv

1627.76 --> 1630.72
where they even show

1629.12 --> 1632.7199999999998
explained that and then showed how

1630.72 --> 1634.64
there's an escape capsule

1632.72 --> 1637.1200000000001
an escape

1634.64 --> 1639.44
slide basically into a

1637.12 --> 1641.76
like a a bunker where you're actually

1639.44 --> 1644.4
protected from that sound

1641.76 --> 1646.559
it's like what

1644.4 --> 1649.44
but yeah it had a good point like yeah

1646.559 --> 1651.84
the sound is like the one of the loudest

1649.44 --> 1653.52
sounds in the world so explosive you can

1651.84 --> 1655.52
hear it super far away well that means

1653.52 --> 1657.52
if you're right next to it you're

1655.52 --> 1659.84
basically just

1657.52 --> 1662.799
yeah if you would get like really close

1659.84 --> 1665.9189999999999
you would just be liquefied

1662.799 --> 1669.279
from the sheer loudness of the vibration

1665.919 --> 1671.919
but even on top you would just like

1669.279 --> 1674.159
yeah something would burst inside of you

1671.919 --> 1676.48
eventually

1674.159 --> 1676.48
so

1677.52 --> 1681.44
that's what i saw

1679.76 --> 1685.279
there's this video about it it was

1681.44 --> 1685.279
reposted not too long ago

1685.36 --> 1690.4799999999998
i wanna i think i shared it even back

1687.44 --> 1692.3990000000001
then on my show i linked you up

1690.48 --> 1694.08
it might yeah it's like a month ago or

1692.399 --> 1697.32
maybe two even i don't know somewhere

1694.08 --> 1697.32
this summer

1705.44 --> 1709.279
right yeah now the g forces are not

1707.76 --> 1712.32
problematic

1709.279 --> 1715.2
you know why they do even the g-force

1712.32 --> 1718.1589999999999
gravitron thing

1715.2 --> 1720.88
it's not necessarily for the supposed

1718.159 --> 1722.96
g-force of the acceleration which really

1720.88 --> 1724.88
isn't all that big

1722.96 --> 1729.3600000000001
i mean it keeps going faster but the

1724.88 --> 1729.3600000000001
overall it doesn't like launch like a

1730.08 --> 1734.0
like a ballistic missile or something

1732.159 --> 1736.72
which you know have seen that they're

1734.0 --> 1739.039
just like boom they shoot off super yeah

1736.72 --> 1741.1200000000001
that would just that g forces on that is

1739.039 --> 1742.559
incredible you would cr absolutely be

1741.12 --> 1744.4799999999998
crushed but that doesn't happen with

1742.559 --> 1747.76
rocket launchers they

1744.48 --> 1750.08
lift off relatively slowly

1747.76 --> 1751.12
so the g-forces on the gravitron aren't

1750.08 --> 1753.52
even meant for that you know what

1751.12 --> 1756.399
they're meant for that training

1753.52 --> 1758.0
it's for deep space

1756.399 --> 1760.9599999999998
like if you would

1758.0 --> 1762.799
for example get caught up with this ship

1760.96 --> 1767.2
in a spin right

1762.799 --> 1769.2
like in gravity the movie or like in

1767.2 --> 1770.3990000000001
interstellar it happened to

1769.2 --> 1773.279
right

1770.399 --> 1776.08
that's the g-force that that thing is

1773.279 --> 1779.08
training you for really it's not for the

1776.08 --> 1779.08
launch

1780.399 --> 1785.36
it's for hazardous g-forces of getting

1784.08 --> 1788.6
in a spin

1785.36 --> 1788.6
in mid-space

1795.11 --> 1798.06
[Music]

1796.24 --> 1799.6
i mean

1798.06 --> 1801.76
[Music]

1799.6 --> 1802.559
like for example fighter jet pilots

1801.76 --> 1804.8799999999999
right

1802.559 --> 1806.8799999999999
now those people get subjected to

1804.88 --> 1808.96
g-force

1806.88 --> 1811.6000000000001
like especially if they

1808.96 --> 1813.919
if they take a corner a quick corner now

1811.6 --> 1813.9189999999999
that's

1814.0 --> 1820.72
like splat

1816.48 --> 1820.72
you'll get a lot of g-force on you

1820.84 --> 1826.6399999999999
right i think they might even get tested

1823.84 --> 1828.8799999999999
in gravitrons specifically just to see

1826.64 --> 1830.3200000000002
how much their body can take but for

1828.88 --> 1831.7600000000002
astronauts

1830.32 --> 1834.32
like

1831.76 --> 1837.12
it's purely for the hazards of deep

1834.32 --> 1839.6
space and getting stuck in a spin which

1837.12 --> 1841.36
is something that could happen

1839.6 --> 1844.1589999999999
theoretically a lot and that's why they

1841.36 --> 1845.84
love to show that [ __ ] off in sci-fi

1844.159 --> 1848.0800000000002
deep space movies

1845.84 --> 1849.9189999999999
like oh no we've gone in the spin oh we

1848.08 --> 1851.52
have to stabilize

1849.919 --> 1854.3200000000002
spin or

1851.52 --> 1855.9189999999999
equip and we'll start buckling right

1854.32 --> 1857.4399999999998
sci-fi

1855.919 --> 1861.0800000000002
that's what that thing is training

1857.44 --> 1861.0800000000002
astronauts for

1864.64 --> 1869.679
oh the planet made of diamonds yes yes

1867.679 --> 1872.88
tony whitcomb i've heard of that and

1869.679 --> 1875.3600000000001
it's actually um saturn's ring

1872.88 --> 1879.7600000000002
or no wait it was like the r

1875.36 --> 1881.52
it rains diamonds in jupiter storm

1879.76 --> 1883.84
so jupiter is like

1881.52 --> 1885.039
filled with just these flying diamonds

1883.84 --> 1887.52
everywhere

1885.039 --> 1891.08
supposedly that's the story that i heard

1887.52 --> 1891.08
decades ago

1895.84 --> 1902.08
this is

1897.6 --> 1902.08
nebula made of beer okay

1902.799 --> 1907.16
uh

1904.04 --> 1907.1599999999999
[Music]

1925.679 --> 1930.3990000000001
right but yeah my point was with the

1927.919 --> 1933.3600000000001
gravitron that the astronauts have to go

1930.399 --> 1935.039
through is not meant

1933.36 --> 1939.039
to take

1935.039 --> 1939.039
rocket launch g-force

1940.64 --> 1945.64
it's there to train for deep space

1949.2 --> 1953.72
right that's why it's a spin thing

1957.3 --> 1961.05
[Music]

1964.25 --> 1967.44
[Music]

1978.64 --> 1983.679
so where did they make diamonds valuable

1982.559 --> 1985.519
well they're

1983.679 --> 1987.519
shiny yeah but they're more than just

1985.519 --> 1990.24
shiny baubles they're a very unique

1987.519 --> 1991.279
material

1990.24 --> 1994.559
it has

1991.279 --> 1999.12
interesting properties so diamond is

1994.559 --> 2000.6399999999999
naturally valuable it's just not as rare

1999.12 --> 2001.9189999999999
right

2000.64 --> 2005.72
as

2001.919 --> 2005.72
commerce would suggest

2006.96 --> 2010.48
but it is a

2008.64 --> 2014.159
an interesting material

2010.48 --> 2016.08
i mean it's also industrially used

2014.159 --> 2017.1200000000001
like for example with lasers and all

2016.08 --> 2019.84
that

2017.12 --> 2019.84
like big ones

2023.76 --> 2028.48
right but in the mean like technically

2025.84 --> 2030.399
you you don't need natural diamonds to

2028.48 --> 2032.24
do that it's even better to just make

2030.399 --> 2034.0
them artificial

2032.24 --> 2036.32
because then you can absolutely perfect

2034.0 --> 2037.36
it and have it perfectly breakless and

2036.32 --> 2039.76
all that

2037.36 --> 2042.6399999999999
which is much more useful for things

2039.76 --> 2042.64
like lasers so

2044.559 --> 2049.2
because industry has

2046.799 --> 2049.2
allowed

2049.52 --> 2052.8
allowed for the artificial making of

2051.599 --> 2054.3990000000003
diamonds

2052.8 --> 2056.3990000000003
to perfection

2054.399 --> 2058.3199999999997
for industrial purposes

2056.399 --> 2061.839
technically they're not industrially

2058.32 --> 2061.839
valuable as much

2062.72 --> 2068.6789999999996
so i guess that shiny bubbles is

2065.2 --> 2068.6789999999996
technically correct

2068.75 --> 2077.569
[Music]

2082.24 --> 2087.72
wow okay tony whitcomb

2084.72 --> 2087.72
dramatic

2106.96 --> 2112.68
now pjc net now that has not changed

2109.359 --> 2112.68
it's the same

2113.63 --> 2116.9390000000003
[Music]

2119.119 --> 2123.04
like even with the artificial ones

2124.0 --> 2127.92
although i think that by now there is

2126.0 --> 2130.88
like a possibility to just have like a

2127.92 --> 2134.32
molecular printer like that

2130.88 --> 2136.96
so you could almost just make a diamond

2134.32 --> 2139.119
already in a perfect type shape cut and

2136.96 --> 2139.119
all

2139.68 --> 2142.0
not sure though

2141.119 --> 2145.04
but

2142.0 --> 2147.359
i see that as a likely possibility that

2145.04 --> 2150.359
it's come to that point

2147.359 --> 2150.359
already

2158.16 --> 2162.0789999999997
but as far as i know what they how they

2160.24 --> 2164.9599999999996
do it is just like with extreme

2162.079 --> 2164.96
pressurized

2166.4 --> 2171.52
systems that that's how they make

2168.56 --> 2175.2799999999997
diamonds and then like basically let

2171.52 --> 2177.2
the diamond just condense

2175.28 --> 2180.1600000000003
like or

2177.2 --> 2182.16
solidify it's like they introduce it

2180.16 --> 2185.1189999999997
like a liquid or a gas or something and

2182.16 --> 2187.44
then it just like crystallizes they

2185.119 --> 2190.0
might even be like able to use electric

2187.44 --> 2191.599
just something that probably industrial

2190.0 --> 2194.56
secret

2191.599 --> 2197.839
and how to just make it

2194.56 --> 2200.0
solidify exactly in the places they want

2197.839 --> 2202.96
i don't know maybe i'm thinking science

2200.0 --> 2202.96
fiction at this point

2203.28 --> 2207.28
but i heard about the ability to

2205.44 --> 2208.64
artificially make gems and how that

2207.28 --> 2211.119
roughly worked and that is how i

2208.64 --> 2213.1189999999997
described without the precise shape you

2211.119 --> 2214.7200000000003
basically just have a mold and then you

2213.119 --> 2218.079
just put the

2214.72 --> 2220.7999999999997
molecules under high pressure

2218.079 --> 2222.7200000000003
until it literally starts to crystallize

2220.8 --> 2223.599
it but instead of taking a very long

2222.72 --> 2225.4399999999996
time

2223.599 --> 2227.839
because it's hot

2225.44 --> 2230.56
and it's highly pressurized it goes very

2227.839 --> 2232.88
quickly and like they have systems for

2230.56 --> 2234.96
that that can be so insanely pressured

2232.88 --> 2237.6800000000003
that

2234.96 --> 2239.839
yeah it doesn't take forever

2237.68 --> 2244.3199999999997
also i heard there was actually already

2239.839 --> 2245.44
like a nano attack using bacteria

2244.32 --> 2247.6800000000003
to make

2245.44 --> 2250.88
diamonds but that was a very weird story

2247.68 --> 2250.8799999999997
i don't know if that's true

2255.52 --> 2260.079
anyway

2257.2 --> 2260.8799999999997
i mean i've done goldsmithing and we did

2260.079 --> 2263.76
get

2260.88 --> 2266.56
to know about gems as well

2263.76 --> 2268.57
so i got a couple of rumors from that

2266.56 --> 2271.619
department

2268.57 --> 2271.619
[Music]

2278.51 --> 2281.619
[Music]

2282.72 --> 2285.72
right

2297.2 --> 2305.1189999999997
well pgc net look

2300.0 --> 2305.119
it's still kind of expensive to make it

2305.599 --> 2310.96
i mean they're not just it's not like oh

2308.64 --> 2314.48
diamonds are as easy to make as glass

2310.96 --> 2317.2
now it's that cheap no no it's still

2314.48 --> 2319.68
kind of expensive

2317.2 --> 2321.7599999999998
the process itself

2319.68 --> 2324.839
so they're not just gonna mass produce

2321.76 --> 2329.119
it for ornaments or

2324.839 --> 2329.119
something except for well

2330.64 --> 2333.64
yeah just like the

2332.4 --> 2336.56
second

2333.64 --> 2338.4
non-natural gems right and even when i

2336.56 --> 2342.88
was a goldsmith there were like these

2338.4 --> 2342.88
specific gem stores meant for us

2343.2 --> 2347.839
and they had range of options like

2346.0 --> 2350.48
natural gems

2347.839 --> 2352.88
which had like uniqueness to them

2350.48 --> 2354.48
like little imperfections but it would

2352.88 --> 2356.96
yeah it was still

2354.48 --> 2359.76
the high grade

2356.96 --> 2362.48
real gems and and artificial batches

2359.76 --> 2364.96
where it was just artificially made

2362.48 --> 2367.599
through that pressure system so

2364.96 --> 2368.56
because they're cheaper to make it's

2367.599 --> 2370.2400000000002
still

2368.56 --> 2372.72
not

2370.24 --> 2375.04
it's not like a hundred times cheaper or

2372.72 --> 2377.68
anything i think it's more like three

2375.04 --> 2379.7599999999998
times as cheap

2377.68 --> 2381.7599999999998
but it's not like all practically free

2379.76 --> 2384.4
it's not like oh we could just pump this

2381.76 --> 2386.5600000000004
stuff out like sand or something no no

2384.4 --> 2386.56
no

2386.71 --> 2389.909
[Music]

2392.64 --> 2395.64
ah

2397.92 --> 2401.52
water is valuable and common

2411.28 --> 2415.28
or at least clean water is valuable

2416.079 --> 2420.079
i mean polluted water is not really

2418.4 --> 2423.88
valuable at all

2420.079 --> 2423.88
it's just in the way

2457.839 --> 2461.52
right anyway i hope you're enjoying the

2459.52 --> 2463.68
show

2461.52 --> 2466.0
talking about gems if you want to see a

2463.68 --> 2468.16
movie about this that's super exciting

2466.0 --> 2468.16
and

2468.24 --> 2474.0
uh which uncut gems i thought

2471.52 --> 2474.0
like that

2474.079 --> 2480.1600000000003
that was uh yeah it was

2477.119 --> 2483.04
pretty extreme and very grabbly but in a

2480.16 --> 2484.96
in a in a real way

2483.04 --> 2488.48
it was interesting

2484.96 --> 2491.76
and a lot about well uncut gems and cut

2488.48 --> 2491.76
gems and jewelry and

2492.4 --> 2496.1600000000003
how that goes in some circles

2503.599 --> 2509.4
not any circles that i've been like

2505.44 --> 2509.4
super close to but

2510.079 --> 2512.48
right

2513.119 --> 2518.0
so we got another hour to go

2515.97 --> 2520.3999999999996
[Music]

2518.0 --> 2523.04
talked about

2520.4 --> 2525.44
more failed launches

2523.04 --> 2527.92
talking about gems

2525.44 --> 2530.319
how did that come up oh yeah

2527.92 --> 2530.319
because of

2531.119 --> 2536.44
the diamond rain on distant planets

2542.079 --> 2546.1600000000003
i wonder if at some point they're going

2543.76 --> 2548.4
to like joke like oh look we found a

2546.16 --> 2551.04
planet of gold

2548.4 --> 2553.839
it's completely gold and here's the

2551.04 --> 2555.119
weird thing it's flat

2553.839 --> 2557.119
it's like this

2555.119 --> 2561.4
big disc

2557.119 --> 2561.4
it's completely made of gold

2582.16 --> 2588.72
i might have just started a uh

2585.839 --> 2590.4
a small hat fantastical revolution of

2588.72 --> 2592.56
space

2590.4 --> 2594.4
no just kidding

2592.56 --> 2597.92
they probably already thought off at it

2594.4 --> 2597.92
already just didn't do it

2598.14 --> 2604.24
[Music]

2600.4 --> 2606.48
right a giant golden coin in space

2604.24 --> 2609.04
i mean come on what's not appealing

2606.48 --> 2609.04
about that

2617.599 --> 2624.839
anybody see that thing about scepter no

2621.119 --> 2624.839
what are you talking about

2634.64 --> 2638.44
can you be more specific

2652.0 --> 2654.88
oh goody

2659.68 --> 2663.359
that's not very specific it's like oh

2662.0 --> 2665.599
something's happening it's so

2663.359 --> 2668.4
spectacular you're gonna remember it

2665.599 --> 2668.4
like what

2668.56 --> 2673.92
no no i'm not gonna do that you have to

2672.0 --> 2676.64
actually be able

2673.92 --> 2680.8
to tell me what it is

2676.64 --> 2683.92
i'm not gonna go on wild goose chases

2680.8 --> 2685.92
if you can't tell me exactly what it is

2683.92 --> 2689.64
that's supposedly happening then that

2685.92 --> 2689.64
means you don't know

2701.52 --> 2706.88
you just have

2703.28 --> 2709.0400000000004
no saying life-changing event

2706.88 --> 2712.88
you will remember when this happens you

2709.04 --> 2715.44
cannot get more non-specific

2712.88 --> 2718.44
i mean that's literally zero percent

2715.44 --> 2718.44
content

2721.44 --> 2728.079
yes everything will change okay

2723.68 --> 2728.0789999999997
everything will change yes okay

2728.4 --> 2733.839
brilliant everything will change i'd

2730.72 --> 2733.839
never heard that one before

2735.599 --> 2742.52
i mean i've had guys on this channel

2738.0 --> 2743.839
that would come on my show tell me oh

[Music]

2743.839 --> 2751.04

2748.64 --> 2752.0789999999997

2751.04 --> 2754.24
like

2752.079 --> 2755.8390000000004
be something big is gonna happen or the

2754.24 --> 2757.68
end of the world or something or

2755.839 --> 2760.48
everybody's just gonna certainly starve

2757.68 --> 2762.16
to death or go mad like dude i hear

2760.48 --> 2764.319
freaking

2762.16 --> 2766.0789999999997
weirdos saying that sort of [ __ ] all the

2764.319 --> 2768.48
time

2766.079 --> 2771.52
i've heard weirdos say that kind of [ __ ]

2768.48 --> 2771.52
20 years ago

2771.76 --> 2777.5200000000004
and to be fair

2773.44 --> 2777.52
i had such predictions

2778.0 --> 2782.319
don't really put them on the forefront

2779.92 --> 2782.319
anymore

2786.88 --> 2790.119
and weirdly enough

2788.56 --> 2792.48
there's already like a lot of

2790.119 --> 2795.61
synchronization with it anyway out there

2792.48 --> 2798.319
so it's just happening

2795.61 --> 2799.599
[Music]

2798.319 --> 2801.52
now whether there is going to be a

2799.599 --> 2803.92
really big bag that's going to blow up

2801.52 --> 2806.95
half the world

3477.599 --> 3482.5
hey ralph rodriguez good to see you

3480.64 --> 3489.959
how are you doing

3482.5 --> 3489.959
[Music]

3496.559 --> 3502.2400000000002
all right and also look

3499.2 --> 3506.3999999999996
there's a lot unrolling it's just that

3502.24 --> 3506.3999999999996
i'm currently going through sort of a

3507.28 --> 3512.88
seasonal transition

3510.48 --> 3514.72
so i'm just not super eager to start

3512.88 --> 3517.04
diving on i mean a whole bunch of people

3514.72 --> 3518.8799999999997
are just like oh the new

3517.04 --> 3520.72
infighting things happen and they go

3518.88 --> 3524.4
full on in it and just

3520.72 --> 3524.3999999999996
unleash i don't do that

3524.72 --> 3529.359
but i am definitely taking note of

3526.88 --> 3529.359
everything

3529.44 --> 3537.359
and eventually i will just have

3533.04 --> 3539.04
more pronounced opinions and attitudes

3537.359 --> 3542.0
right it's just

3539.04 --> 3544.24
this is all kind of fresh and i'm not

3542.0 --> 3546.48
kind of ready to deal with it just head

3544.24 --> 3546.4799999999996
on

3547.2 --> 3551.9199999999996
it's all just kind of painful to behold

3550.48 --> 3553.52
look like

3551.92 --> 3558.0
yeah

3553.52 --> 3560.559
jaren has been doing and with it

3558.0 --> 3562.24
what is happening and i mean the guys at

3560.559 --> 3563.599
flat earth debate are already right on

3562.24 --> 3566.18
top of it

3563.599 --> 3567.28
they they have no issues it seems so

3566.18 --> 3570.9199999999996
[Music]

3567.28 --> 3570.92
hey steamy traveler

3586.96 --> 3592.52

[Music]

3620.65 --> 3624.88
[Music]

3622.4 --> 3627.92
right but look if

3624.88 --> 3630.2400000000002
if it's kind of gonna stay like this

3627.92 --> 3631.359
everybody's just for some reason really

3630.24 --> 3633.2799999999997
tired

3631.359 --> 3635.2799999999997
including myself

3633.28 --> 3636.6400000000003
during when i normally do the early bird

3635.28 --> 3638.799
show

3636.64 --> 3641.04
and like if it's really gonna stay like

3638.799 --> 3641.04
this

3641.2 --> 3645.2799999999997
and

3643.119 --> 3648.0
not regular be

3645.28 --> 3649.76
regularly be like yesterday when i was

3648.0 --> 3651.76
very energized also because of the

3649.76 --> 3653.28
financial influx

3651.76 --> 3656.0
then

3653.28 --> 3658.1600000000003
i'm going to eventually discontinue the

3656.0 --> 3659.359
flat earth early bird show

3658.16 --> 3662.3999999999996
and

3659.359 --> 3663.92
oh at first attempt to maybe move the

3662.4 --> 3666.64
time zone

3663.92 --> 3668.559
move to the evening

3666.64 --> 3670.64
maybe that's just

3668.559 --> 3674.1600000000003
then people will be more active or

3670.64 --> 3676.24
something i don't know i will try that

3674.16 --> 3678.0789999999997
look i've been holding on to this very

3676.24 --> 3681.5989999999997
specific time slot with the flat earth

3678.079 --> 3682.96
early bird show to be consistent

3681.599 --> 3685.92
to be

3682.96 --> 3688.4
in lockstep oh camera freeze

3685.92 --> 3690.4
with nathan's shows

3688.4 --> 3692.88
and that's just

3690.4 --> 3694.4
part of the reason why i've done that

3692.88 --> 3698.33
to kind of

3694.4 --> 3705.559
make a more daily program

3698.33 --> 3705.5589999999997
[Music]

3707.78 --> 3711.1200000000003
[Music]

3709.76 --> 3714.28
right

3711.12 --> 3714.2799999999997
[Music]

3718.24 --> 3720.9599999999996
4am

3722.0 --> 3725.2
right

3723.2 --> 3726.96
well look i just thought that

3725.2 --> 3728.72
it would be pretty cool to a whole bunch

3726.96 --> 3731.119
of people that actually get up really

3728.72 --> 3731.1189999999997
early

3731.28 --> 3735.8390000000004
because that they use because people

3733.44 --> 3738.48
that i know that have that usually have

3735.839 --> 3740.72
like an abundance of energy

3738.48 --> 3742.88
sometimes even a bit wild

3740.72 --> 3744.799
in the morning

3742.88 --> 3747.839
and that's what i was

3744.799 --> 3749.68
well hoping to kind of connect up with

3747.839 --> 3752.64
a bit

3749.68 --> 3755.64
but then again maybe i'm just too

3752.64 --> 3755.64
aggressive

3755.92 --> 3759.599
i'm not sure

3757.359 --> 3762.4
but it's it's worked out for you

3759.599 --> 3766.079
literally years you literally now done

3762.4 --> 3768.64
this for years and it's worked out

3766.079 --> 3770.88
people come and go and some people

3768.64 --> 3773.1189999999997
really appreciate me

3770.88 --> 3773.119
so

3773.76 --> 3779.5200000000004
right but if the finances are just gonna

3776.559 --> 3781.599
keep running to a halt

3779.52 --> 3784.48
for whatever reason then i might just

3781.599 --> 3784.48
have to move

3787.52 --> 3790.72
or

3788.799 --> 3793.359
what i'm also hoping for is that just

3790.72 --> 3796.48
people that watch my shows at a distance

3793.359 --> 3798.72
that don't really want to get in chat

3796.48 --> 3800.559
that they'd get more forward and maybe

3798.72 --> 3802.8799999999997
support me too and it has happened

3800.559 --> 3804.3190000000004
people that never came on the show would

3802.88 --> 3807.28
support me

3804.319 --> 3807.2799999999997
because they did watch

3807.839 --> 3811.799
i mean that would be great

3815.119 --> 3817.599
huh

3815.93 --> 3821.0389999999998
[Music]

3817.599 --> 3821.039
right flatter sage yeah

3821.2 --> 3827.2799999999997
right but yeah you're in europe so it's

3824.319 --> 3827.2799999999997
another time zone

3834.88 --> 3838.559
right but yeah the people in the us

3836.88 --> 3842.2400000000002
don't have that

3838.559 --> 3842.2400000000002
for them it's like really early

3843.92 --> 3846.48
almost like

3846.72 --> 3850.359
farmer early

3856.96 --> 3861.28
right but i'm glad that that it helps

3859.2 --> 3863.0389999999998
you

3861.28 --> 3866.559
that's what i want i want everybody to

3863.039 --> 3869.2000000000003
just be able to

3866.559 --> 3871.76
be stimulated to be able to optimize

3869.2 --> 3875.64
whatever they're doing

3871.76 --> 3875.6400000000003
so they don't get stuck

3880.88 --> 3884.48
yeah pgc net yeah i know it wasn't

3882.799 --> 3887.52
called flat earth night oh it was just

3884.48 --> 3887.52
the night owl show

3889.039 --> 3892.96
right but

3890.16 --> 3894.48
look the thing is if this is just not

3892.96 --> 3897.119
really working out

3894.48 --> 3899.68
because of financial situation

3897.119 --> 3900.6400000000003
then i will give it a try with the night

3899.68 --> 3901.9199999999996
owl

3900.64 --> 3904.0
but i don't know it's going to be

3901.92 --> 3908.039
extremely different because it's another

3904.0 --> 3908.039
time in a day for me

3913.52 --> 3919.44
i'm not a hundred percent sure if i'm

3915.839 --> 3919.44
going to be even all that sharp

3919.92 --> 3924.48
if i would like do a daily night owl

3922.24 --> 3924.4799999999996

like going out on the streets

4106.319 --> 4112.64
and playing music for money

4109.04 --> 4114.35
so it's basically a street musician

4112.64 --> 4118.259

4165.759 --> 4169.679
i went on gym mobs yesterday that was

4168.08 --> 4172.0
fun

4169.679 --> 4172.839
flyers debate it's probably

4172.0 --> 4177.44
i think

4172.839 --> 4182.239
it's like very likely that kiwi's gonna

4177.44 --> 4182.239
unveil his numpty clip on the show today

4183.359 --> 4188.799
and

4185.12 --> 4191.599999999999
i don't know what else is gonna happen

4188.799 --> 4194.32
maybe even like the blue origin

4191.6 --> 4196.8
situation might also come up

4194.32 --> 4196.799999999999
i don't know

4200.88 --> 4204.88
and probably more talk about ether

4207.92 --> 4211.6
hopefully most of the technical

4209.52 --> 4214.320000000001
difficulties with

4211.6 --> 4218.76
gilded and all that

4214.32 --> 4218.759999999999
has also been neutralized

4251.91 --> 4256.5599999999995
[Music]

4254.8 --> 4258.88
all right

4256.56 --> 4261.360000000001
anyway yeah come on guys let's keep the

4258.88 --> 4264.88
conversation rolling

4261.36 --> 4267.929999999999
still got half an hour to go

4264.88 --> 4267.93
[Music]

4277.28 --> 4282.239
wait i completely forgot to check whom

4279.679 --> 4282.2390000000005
benjamin

4282.96 --> 4287.32
was this show gonna be about

4287.84 --> 4291.679
i was doing instagram streams

4294.88 --> 4298.719
some left interesting

4299.04 --> 4303.04
oh wait there's a whole bunch of streams

4300.8 --> 4303.04
oh

4306.48 --> 4310.239
right but yeah owen is definitely going

4308.56 --> 4312.4800000000005
now with like the

4310.239 --> 4316.959999999999
the right being

4312.48 --> 4316.959999999999
well i think he's calling it sub left

4317.28 --> 4324.199
just uh

4319.04 --> 4324.199
i mean he is on to it with all that

4344.32 --> 4347.679
i think

4345.28 --> 4349.5199999999995
people are stressed don't want to talk

4347.679 --> 4351.4400000000005
about anything scary or hurting

4349.52 --> 4353.84
financially

4351.44 --> 4355.839999999999
right well i don't necessarily want to

4353.84 --> 4358.400000000001
talk about that either right i don't

4355.84 --> 4362.52
want to like oh the doom is coming

4358.4 --> 4362.5199999999995
right i'm not doing that right

4371.44 --> 4375.0
it's just practical

4385.92 --> 4390.8
all right and yeah also it is bumming me

4388.4 --> 4392.799999999999
out so that is maybe kind of the thing

4390.8 --> 4395.360000000001
that you're just feeling

4392.8 --> 4397.360000000001
that i'm not really happy about how

4395.36 --> 4399.36
things have developed not with the show

4397.36 --> 4400.96
because that's just fine

4399.36 --> 4403.36
i love you guys

4400.96 --> 4405.679
i love being online

4403.36 --> 4408.08
with you guys and like going over gym

4405.679 --> 4409.36
bobs and going over at nathan's i love

4408.08 --> 4410.719
that

4409.36 --> 4415.04
that's great

4410.719 --> 4415.04
it's just that my living situation is

4415.92 --> 4420.32
getting

4417.52 --> 4420.320000000001
more difficult

4421.12 --> 4425.84
and i've heard of others too like

4423.84 --> 4427.76
over skype conversations too like i'm

4425.84 --> 4428.88
not the only one

4427.76 --> 4430.159000000001
but

4428.88 --> 4431.36
i'm having

4430.159 --> 4434.46
like

4431.36 --> 4436.719
stability issues because of that

4434.46 --> 4439.04
[Music]

4436.719 --> 4442.08
and i've always had that i'm not great

4439.04 --> 4445.44
with finances finances like really tend

4442.08 --> 4447.76
to stress me out when things go wrong

4445.44 --> 4450.0
and then ruin everything like my entire

4447.76 --> 4450.0
day

4450.48 --> 4454.5599999999995
so that's why i just try to stay away

4452.48 --> 4459.32
from it as much as possible so that it

4454.56 --> 4459.320000000001
has the least amount of space in my head

4462.38 --> 4465.579
[Music]

4485.199 --> 4489.28
right but look up

4487.6 --> 4491.280000000001
if i can just

4489.28 --> 4493.44
manage to get by

4491.28 --> 4496.5599999999995
then i'll just try to do this for as

4493.44 --> 4499.44
long as i can

4496.56 --> 4499.4400000000005
i mean i mean it

4503.52 --> 4508.400000000001
and i'm very eager to dig into well

4506.239 --> 4510.639999999999
non-depressing subjects interesting

4508.4 --> 4512.639999999999
subjects right i don't just because i

4510.64 --> 4514.4800000000005
feel like down because of my situation

4512.64 --> 4516.64
doesn't mean that you have to do that

4514.48 --> 4516.639999999999
too

4517.36 --> 4520.92
absolutely not

4540.719 --> 4544.159
right

4541.52 --> 4546.159000000001
and because yeah my response eventually

4544.159 --> 4548.48
will just is that yeah it will be that i

4546.159 --> 4550.839999999999
will get pissed because we're under

4548.48 --> 4552.799999999999
siege and it's getting

4550.84 --> 4555.4400000000005
really

4552.8 --> 4557.360000000001
really agitating to me it has been for

4555.44 --> 4559.919999999999
us i've mostly just tried to suppress it

4557.36 --> 4561.839999999999
otherwise i i start rage winning too

4559.92 --> 4565.32
much and it's not productive it's not

4561.84 --> 4565.32
helpful anymore

4567.28 --> 4572.48
i mean

4568.239 --> 4572.48
doing that is not going to make it stop

4575.36 --> 4581.839999999999
right but i am

4577.04 --> 4581.84
fed with great interest following

4582.64 --> 4587.4400000000005
well some people in politics here

4585.679 --> 4589.6
for democracy

4587.44 --> 4591.44
i'm following with like

4589.6 --> 4593.280000000001
i'm not the only i mean they got some

4591.44 --> 4595.759999999999
eyes on them because there's a whole

4593.28 --> 4599.12
bunch of people that probably feel very

4595.76 --> 4601.6
close to what i feel about it

4599.12 --> 4603.599999999999
and these guys seem to be the only one

4601.6 --> 4606.96
that are actually addressing like the

4603.6 --> 4608.719
deep rooted corruption that is present

4606.96 --> 4611.44
in the government and it's like even

4608.719 --> 4612.8
open now they they call it the cartel

4611.44 --> 4614.96
parties

4612.8 --> 4617.1990000000005
and that's exactly what it is

4614.96 --> 4618.4800000000005
and they can't even say that when they

4617.199 --> 4621.44
call that

4618.48 --> 4623.839999999999
they immediately get shut down on the

4621.44 --> 4626.08
on the yeah on the floor

4623.84 --> 4629.1990000000005
as soon as they say cartel parties

4626.08 --> 4633.239
immediately just might cut off

4629.199 --> 4633.239
so they're just being censored

4638.159 --> 4644.5599999999995
all right yeah i sometimes forward some

4640.88 --> 4647.12
repost forward some messages

4644.56 --> 4650.0
over at twitter

4647.12 --> 4651.92
so you might see some it's dutch spoken

4650.0 --> 4654.08
so you might not get it

4651.92 --> 4655.76
if you're outside of the netherlands

4654.08 --> 4659.88
but you'll probably be able to guess

4655.76 --> 4659.88
roughly what it's going to be about

4672.719 --> 4677.52
right so

4674.159 --> 4681.12
i still feel that potentially it might

4677.52 --> 4681.120000000001
there might be a way to

4681.84 --> 4684.719
to make it stop

4685.28 --> 4689.0
at least over here

4693.6 --> 4696.56
it's just that me personally i don't

4695.6 --> 4699.4400000000005
know

4696.56 --> 4702.96
i don't know what i can do about it

4699.44 --> 4703.919999999999
except for just try to keep going

4702.96 --> 4706.2390000000005
doing

4703.92 --> 4709.04
what i do and just not corrupt not

4706.239 --> 4711.44
change not falter

4709.04 --> 4714.159
spiritually and then

4711.44 --> 4718.599999999999
everything should be all right

4714.159 --> 4718.599999999999
good enough whatever is left

4726.159 --> 4729.12
come on guys

4731.12 --> 4736.679
does that all really deserve a minutes

4733.52 --> 4736.679
of silence

4763.36 --> 4768.4
look scott

4765.44 --> 4770.719
last commenting in my chat

4768.4 --> 4772.96
yeah those are all problems

4770.719 --> 4772.96
but

4773.6 --> 4777.360000000001
there's literally nothing you can

4775.36 --> 4781.599999999999
directly do about it

4777.36 --> 4784.799999999999
we've been tricked we've been besieged

4781.6 --> 4784.8
and it's just like the

4786.32 --> 4789.639999999999
what is it

4790.159 --> 4796.96
like it was a the big crisis it was also

4793.28 --> 4799.04
in the netherlands in was it the 20s

4796.96 --> 4800.4
when there was like a severe food

4799.04 --> 4802.32
shortage

4800.4 --> 4804.96
for a while

4802.32 --> 4807.679
and like people even ate bark from trees

4804.96 --> 4807.679
like people

4807.84 --> 4811.12
uh

4808.8 --> 4811.12
well

4812.32 --> 4816.799999999999
it is doable

4814.159 --> 4820.5599999999995
it's not reasonable it's demoralizing

4816.8 --> 4820.56
but it is doable i mean

4821.36 --> 4825.599999999999
the best thing is to just not panic

4823.28 --> 4827.44
because panicking just costs you more

4825.6 --> 4830.0
energy

4827.44 --> 4830.839999999999
creates more stress more stress creates

4830.0 --> 4833.36
more

4830.84 --> 4835.52
strain and then you will need more

4833.36 --> 4837.679
resources to accommodate for that which

4835.52 --> 4840.0
you don't have

4837.679 --> 4841.679
so yeah that's how you go through a

4840.0 --> 4843.52
drought

4841.679 --> 4845.679
goody

4843.52 --> 4846.56
aren't we all just looking forward to

4845.679 --> 4849.52
that

4846.56 --> 4849.52
no no we're not

4858.84 --> 4862.88
uh okay already

4861.92 --> 4864.719
you don't

4862.88 --> 4866.64
piss me off it's just

4864.719 --> 4868.719
when you start to really

4866.64 --> 4870.8
roll into the baller tactics that's when

4868.719 --> 4872.719
you start to piss me off but

4870.8 --> 4875.12
that's not personal it's just the

4872.719 --> 4876.88
behavior that i get pissed off with

4875.12 --> 4878.64
that's all

4876.88 --> 4880.88
i know you're

4878.64 --> 4884.719
yeah it's just being possessed by the

4880.88 --> 4884.719
globe spirit you can't help it

4886.0 --> 4891.92
well you can't help it but it's yeah

4901.199 --> 4903.839999999999
yeah

4914.84 --> 4922.56
what the laser used to convert plastic

4919.28 --> 4924.239
bottles into diamonds what the

4922.56 --> 4926.88
no i've never heard of that that sounds

4924.239 --> 4930.28
really weird

4926.88 --> 4930.28
like why

4932.96 --> 4937.04
i guess

4934.159 --> 4939.199
it's better than plastic waste

4937.04 --> 4939.199
but

4940.719 --> 4947.42
i mean you could just recycle it

4944.2 --> 4947.42
[Music]

4960.159 --> 4964.239
it means they're inside uranus inside

4963.04 --> 4967.28
neptune

4964.239 --> 4970.5199999999995
inside some moons such as titan

4967.28 --> 4970.5199999999995
the diamonds

4976.239 --> 4981.839999999999
oh right it wasn't jupiter it was

4978.08 --> 4985.88
neptune wasn't it yeah yeah

4981.84 --> 4985.88
that's where the diamonds were

4986.12 --> 4991.199
supposedly this is thanks for the

4988.719 --> 4991.199
article

4991.92 --> 4996.32
i just immediately skipped to that part

4996.4 --> 5000.5199999999995
because that's in there too

5012.32 --> 5017.5199999999995
equal to one-fifth the pressure in

5015.52 --> 5020.639
earth's core

5017.52 --> 5022.88
oh my god i mean seriously when you're

5020.639 --> 5024.719
i'm reading it i mean this could be

5022.88 --> 5026.8
total horseshit

5024.719 --> 5029.679
this could literally be science fiction

5026.8 --> 5031.360000000001
because there's so much baller nonsense

5029.679 --> 5033.4400000000005
woven through this

5031.36 --> 5036.639
and it's not necessary this was purely

5033.44 --> 5036.638999999999
technological then

5037.199 --> 5042.199
then why even need to tackle the

[ __ ]

5047.92 --> 5051.52
i mean there's a chance that that's just

5049.6 --> 5054.0
completely fake

5051.52 --> 5054.0
just saying

5054.159 --> 5058.799999999999
not a guarantee it might be real but it

5056.159 --> 5061.839999999999
just reads in a way i'm like getting

5058.8 --> 5061.84
highly suspicious

what phone is hacked what the [ __ ]

5075.76 --> 5080.88
oh wait forbidden link

5078.56 --> 5080.88
what

5082.96 --> 5086.88
oh well maybe the link yeah

5090.719 --> 5096.719
well it's because it's https

5094.56 --> 5098.96
maybe if the s is taken out that

5096.719 --> 5100.08
wouldn't happen i don't know why it's

5098.96 --> 5103.08
abs

5100.08 --> 5103.08
anyway

5115.199 --> 5118.799999999999
yeah it seems to work just fine

5120.48 --> 5123.48
weird

5151.76 --> 5155.92
wow yeah you're no kidding there is huge

5154.719 --> 5158.4
amounts of

5155.92 --> 5158.4
the same

5161.36 --> 5166.0

5190.639 --> 5193.639
interesting

5198.88 --> 5203.08
from sn explorers.org

5204.56 --> 5206.88
all right

5207.199 --> 5211.28
talking about how they might even use

5209.12 --> 5213.12
those micro diamonds in

5211.28 --> 5216.12
well computers

5213.12 --> 5216.12

5257.28 --> 5262.32
for being there and the interesting

5260.32 --> 5264.48
article

5262.32 --> 5267.12
that's pretty funny

5264.48 --> 5269.199
especially if one day

5267.12 --> 5270.8
we could have

5269.199 --> 5272.638999999999
like

5270.8 --> 5275.679
sub light

5272.639 --> 5277.76
computing and then micro diamonds being

5275.679 --> 5280.4800000000005
very easily made

5277.76 --> 5282.8
could be extremely useful for that if

5280.48 --> 5285.36
you want to make computers

5282.8 --> 5287.6
that chips that aren't based on

5285.36 --> 5290.08
electricity but on light

5287.6 --> 5292.639
on sub

5290.08 --> 5295.639
yeah sub quanta light

5292.639 --> 5295.639
huh

5295.84 --> 5302.28
so that certainly hooked into my sci-fi

5298.639 --> 5302.28

separately on a computer or something

5355.44 --> 5361.5199999999995
and then just have the entire thing

5357.76 --> 5361.52
it reinstalled and then you just

5361.6 --> 5365.120000000001
move the stuff back

5363.44 --> 5367.36
onto it

5365.12 --> 5369.76
