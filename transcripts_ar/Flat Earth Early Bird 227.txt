7.05 --> 42.25
[Music]

38.37 --> 46.089999999999996
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.25 --> 47.74
early-bird number 227 I'm your host

46.09 --> 49.540000000000006
Arwen and before we start the show

47.74 --> 51.97
please don't forget to share it on any

49.54 --> 53.41
platform you deem fit and also if you

51.97 --> 55.24
haven't already subscribed to my channel

53.41 --> 56.709999999999994
and hit the bell notification so you

55.24 --> 59.230000000000004
know when I'm going live which is

56.71 --> 65.89
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

59.23 --> 72.89999999999999
day so also please support the show the

65.89 --> 75.94
weather today is just magnificent it's

72.9 --> 79.17
yeah I was out and it was just such a

75.94 --> 82.75
glorious day there's not yeah there's

79.17 --> 85.9
barely any chemtrails or well none I

82.75 --> 87.85
haven't actually seen any there's a

85.9 --> 91.86
plane over there it's not leaving a chem

87.85 --> 91.86
trail I don't know if you can see it

94.72 --> 99.66
wait think how the lens is dirty

109.77 --> 119.22
weird zoom issues hmm anywhere there's a

114.21 --> 123.96
plane over there but the camera doesn't

119.22 --> 127.17
like this for some reason weird anyway

123.96 --> 131.43
it's beautiful it's really sunny but

127.17 --> 134.1
it's also breezing and it's a fresh

131.43 --> 141.29000000000002
breeze so it's just a gorgeous gorgeous

134.1 --> 148.53
day and I've enjoyed it a lot so far I

141.29 --> 152.25
got to Mara coffee with me and tea

148.53 --> 155.88
that's it I could have gotten some

152.25 --> 158.67
berries or something but didn't can't

155.88 --> 167.32999999999998
spoiling myself boom spoil myself all

158.67 --> 167.32999999999998
the time so let's see who is in chat

168.53 --> 176.13
okay a gem

170.69 --> 180.54
Steve ace MacLeod was not really first

176.13 --> 184.47
but yeah righteous force Geoffrey bill

180.54 --> 194.57899999999998
James Mason IVA Kilda hope good morning

184.47 --> 198.66
there good afternoon so yeah if you look

194.579 --> 206.31
in the description box my youtube I now

198.66 --> 208.32
have live chat rules it might be a

206.31 --> 210.299
little superfluous it's basically the

208.32 --> 212.25
rules that I have been speaking about

210.299 --> 217.17000000000002
during the Hangout but I thought maybe

212.25 --> 218.94
if I just put them in there yeah I don't

217.17 --> 228.06
need to warn people about it all the

218.94 --> 232.37
time they can just read it so there's

228.06 --> 232.37
any comments on that I'd love to hear it

243.79 --> 251.739
you yeah you might have taken notice

246.069 --> 254.29
that I've put in a certain a a Catholic

251.739 --> 258.25
type bribe system in the sense that if

254.29 --> 260.59
you miss behavior and you get banned for

258.25 --> 263.08
it you can actually bribe your way back

260.59 --> 268.479
to the front she can't control yourself

263.08 --> 271.71999999999997
but you really want to not forcing you

268.479 --> 273.76
to do that and it's not like okay now if

271.72 --> 275.05
you get banned you will always have to

273.76 --> 278.979
know I'm not gonna be like that I'm not

275.05 --> 279.61
gonna extort my audience but look with

278.979 --> 281.40999999999997
some people

279.61 --> 284.07
I'll just ban them and then just

281.41 --> 287.889
unbanned them when I feel like it

284.07 --> 292.36
but if there's some real troll ya

287.889 --> 295.09000000000003
bastards out there if they really want

292.36 --> 298.5
to be able to chat here then they'll

295.09 --> 301.17999999999995
have to ya earn their way back in

298.5 --> 304.99
because otherwise I'm just not gonna do

301.18 --> 305.61
it and yeah even Lottie is welcome to do

304.99 --> 309.31
that

305.61 --> 313.12
look if yeah that's pretty much it you

309.31 --> 315.28000000000003
know if people support me then that

313.12 --> 321.639
gives them some credit even to goof

315.28 --> 323.48999999999995
around that's just that's logical I feel

321.639 --> 326.86
that's just normal

323.49 --> 329.349
hey and if you support me just through

326.86 --> 331.45
word of mouth and through verbal

329.349 --> 333.789
emotional support or through great

331.45 --> 337.33
questions then that is also that also

333.789 --> 343.81
gives you some credit so I'm basically

337.33 --> 347.08
working with a social my personal social

343.81 --> 351.45
credit exchange just with behave based

347.08 --> 351.45
on behaviors and information exchange

353.439 --> 358.779
I don't know sounds really wrong when I

355.749 --> 361.959
say credit score yeah

358.779 --> 364.389
so be warned if you troll me too much

361.959 --> 367.659
suddenly you'll get a travel ban and

364.389 --> 369.819
that it's nothing nothing like that

367.659 --> 373.839
don't worry about it unless I become

369.819 --> 377.369
emperor of the world no just kidding who

373.839 --> 377.36899999999997
wants to be Emperor of the world anyway

384.15 --> 387.17999999999995
[Music]

388.499 --> 395.22900000000004
yeah yeah I did put a little thought in

391.209 --> 398.619
it thanks James Mason a wrench

395.229 --> 400.539
it's the the tool the spanner the thing

398.619 --> 403.02900000000005
that Jeffrey bill and righteous forth

400.539 --> 408.089
force and Steve have that's a wrench

403.029 --> 408.089
right didn't spell it wrong right

413.199 --> 416.249
maybe it did

455.4 --> 457.46
you

463.46 --> 468.96999999999997
[Â __Â ] how did that happen

470.509 --> 479.259
was i unmute all the time are you

476.749 --> 479.259
serious

480.639 --> 486.249
when when did I go on mute I didn't

483.559 --> 486.249
press the button

495.0 --> 502.66
weird it just muted that freaking button

499.36 --> 506.01
that it blinks when it's muted I didn't

502.66 --> 512.4
touch it and it just muted what the hell

506.01 --> 512.4
somebody hacked remote hack through D

512.55 --> 519.79
what is it again for the pretty internet

515.89 --> 525.6
of things my mic somebody some troll is

519.79 --> 528.9399999999999
hacking my mic and muting me right

525.6 --> 531.22
anyway a wrench is also known as a

528.94 --> 534.99
spanner to just repeat that little Pete

531.22 --> 540.9300000000001
bit and what it's for it's basically to

534.99 --> 549.28
screw loose or tighten screws and bolts

540.93 --> 553.5699999999999
mostly bolts yeah screws if they have a

549.28 --> 555.6999999999999
bolt function as well but that's what a

553.57 --> 563.4300000000001
spanner is so it's literally to screw

555.7 --> 563.4300000000001
around in chat kind of ironic isn't it

574.07 --> 582.96
hmm oh look I've got a globe or in the

577.68 --> 587.31
house Oh mind warped you devious bastard

582.96 --> 590.64
hacking my things are you sure you have

587.31 --> 596.8499999999999
to write clearance for that just kidding

590.64 --> 599.64
Oh a flat side Fe right so the global

596.85 --> 602.22
question explain to me why we live on a

599.64 --> 607.86
flatter why you think we live on a flat

602.22 --> 611.58
earth well from everything I've seen so

607.86 --> 614.4
far except pictures from unreliable

611.58 --> 619.5600000000001
people whose specialization has been for

614.4 --> 622.5889999999999
over a century animatronics now it yeah

619.56 --> 624.779
also maybe I guess not as cinematics

622.589 --> 629.61
what is the thing cinematography that's

624.779 --> 632.64
the one so the only supposed suggestive

629.61 --> 641.3100000000001
evidence that we live on a globe is from

632.64 --> 645.29
the world's first most I don't know

641.31 --> 645.29
what's wrong with my vocabulary today

645.32 --> 651.2700000000001
with the X the leading in cinematography

648.54 --> 653.52
Nathan can say it a lot a lot better

651.27 --> 655.26
than me but the leading edge of

653.52 --> 657.3299999999999
cinematography that's what NASA is

655.26 --> 660.63
they're the only ones that give any kind

657.33 --> 663.87
of direct int that it's a globe the

660.63 --> 665.82
other the only other real suggestion is

663.87 --> 667.44
a presupposition that the global of the

665.82 --> 669.1500000000001
heavens is actually wrapped around the

667.44 --> 671.6400000000001
ball which is a very obvious

669.15 --> 674.0699999999999
presupposition and those are really the

671.64 --> 677.58
only intuitive elements that do this

674.07 --> 679.98
because the supposed care feature which

677.58 --> 683.4000000000001
is basically optics based the horizon

679.98 --> 688.47
mistaking the horizon optical phenomena

683.4 --> 692.61
for a physical edge of a curve that is

688.47 --> 694.08
very easy to dispel very easy basically

692.61 --> 696.39
by showing that yeah you have this

694.08 --> 698.279
apparent suppose it's curved and then if

696.39 --> 700.709
there's enough clarity in the distance

698.279 --> 702.54
there will be something higher giving

700.709 --> 705.329
another supposed curve so it doesn't

702.54 --> 706.529
really make any sense that part it's

705.329 --> 710.689
very easy to dispel

706.529 --> 714.629
for me so yeah combining all of that

710.689 --> 718.2199999999999
very very very little even intuitive

714.629 --> 724.1700000000001
indications are left that the earth is

718.22 --> 727.23
ball shaped in the yeah in this setting

724.17 --> 731.2199999999999
that is presupposed by the but by the

727.23 --> 733.139
authorities at nasa that just doesn't

731.22 --> 735.899
seem to be the case i'm not excluding

733.139 --> 738.779
that it might not be perfectly flat or

735.899 --> 741.17
some huge Jupiter sized earth basically

738.779 --> 744.87
in which on which we are just a little

741.17 --> 750.3499999999999
circle that could be it if it is this

744.87 --> 754.589
ship or it may simply be flat or just

750.35 --> 756.9590000000001
almost flat and this realm itself is

754.589 --> 759.839
just really weird in its entirety and

756.959 --> 763.8599999999999
there may be a looping factor you know

759.839 --> 765.6
I've even considered an especially

763.86 --> 768.089
limited looping realm there could be

765.6 --> 771.629
some really serious confusing things

768.089 --> 775.379
going on for example just imagine the

771.629 --> 779.4200000000001
rectangular looping earth right let's

775.379 --> 779.4200000000001
just take a sheet of paper for my

783.879 --> 790.54
so what if on this were the typical

787.85 --> 793.6990000000001
continents that we know it have like

790.54 --> 795.529
America over here and you have Europe

793.699 --> 798.439
and Asia over there Africa here

795.529 --> 801.829
Australia here South America there like

798.439 --> 804.709
that okay so in the looping realm these

801.829 --> 811.939
this side and this side are directly

804.709 --> 813.649
connected as if they were a two but

811.939 --> 816.4989999999999
they're not physically literal two

813.649 --> 819.649
because the essential curvature for that

816.499 --> 822.8190000000001
geometrical literalness is not present

819.649 --> 824.029
if there would then we could also

822.819 --> 826.009
mistake

824.029 --> 828.679
yeah mistakenly take it for a globe much

826.009 --> 832.22
easier there's not there's no indication

828.679 --> 834.889
that it is a geometrical circle of that

832.22 --> 838.249
size the curvature does not accommodate

834.889 --> 840.47
for that but there may be some really

838.249 --> 844.16
freaky issues going on that are even

840.47 --> 846.129
very tough to figure out so what if the

844.16 --> 848.66
rectangular looping Flat Earth is

846.129 --> 855.1
geometrically not perfectly flat like

848.66 --> 858.8
this what if it is looping but very

855.1 --> 862.429
slightly curved now there you got

858.8 --> 866.7199999999999
something really freaky because how do

862.429 --> 872.5889999999999
you explain that it loops in on itself

866.72 --> 875.779
but it's only a micro curve now

872.589 --> 879.0790000000001
that'll confuse the hell out a lot of

875.779 --> 881.24
people could be that's the weird thing

879.079 --> 884.42
about special non-linearity you don't

881.24 --> 886.549
really know how the realm connects you

884.42 --> 890.6289999999999
have to Tinker Tailor measure everything

886.549 --> 893.12
won't vast scales and not just a trust

890.629 --> 895.309
on optics because optics have all this

893.12 --> 897.29
yeah these limitations limited viewing

895.309 --> 900.949
angle that the rise in the fact that

897.29 --> 905.86
basically just compacts view so there's

900.949 --> 908.329
no reliable way to really measure the

905.86 --> 912.529
surface of the earth using optics

908.329 --> 916.43
although there are basic deductions you

912.529 --> 919.34
can perform like sizing up the

916.43 --> 921.8599999999999
concealment rate over distance in which

919.34 --> 925.82
I proposed there is very likely to be an

921.86 --> 929.09
average linearity to it with of course

925.82 --> 930.9200000000001
atmospheric effects yeah fooling around

929.09 --> 934.4
maybe making it a little bit more wobbly

930.92 --> 937.88
but the rate will be average for

934.4 --> 943.36
distance / height of the concealment of

937.88 --> 946.9
the things concealed and yeah from that

943.36 --> 949.85
presupposed graph that I expect there to

946.9 --> 953.36
manifest at some point very distinctly

949.85 --> 954.9200000000001
and well I could technically do it

953.36 --> 957.17
myself but yeah I'm gonna need some

954.92 --> 960.16
investment and a freaking boat like Ron

957.17 --> 963.68
T is kind of trying that kind of thing

960.16 --> 965.99
but I don't have yeah things available

963.68 --> 968.06
to me in order to do anything like that

965.99 --> 968.92
maybe he'll try it at some point who

968.06 --> 973.279
knows

968.92 --> 976.0999999999999
obstruction rates if you take into

973.279 --> 981.01
account its linear then geometrical

976.1 --> 984.2900000000001
ferocity becomes excluded by default

981.01 --> 990.3389999999999
geometrical logic and a flat surface of

984.29 --> 996.79
any nature is left or as good as flat

990.339 --> 1001.1800000000001
not curved enough to to accommodate any

996.79 --> 1007.4499999999999
kind of small size shape as it were or

1001.18 --> 1011.7399999999999
small shape with a radius or a a width

1007.45 --> 1014.8900000000001
of our known confined realm or the realm

1011.74 --> 1019.36
we know our yeah the earth realm which

1014.89 --> 1022.48
might be bigger so whatever the shape

1019.36 --> 1026.41
may be it's not curved enough to make it

1022.48 --> 1027.67
into a shape that only confines and

1026.41 --> 1030.7900000000002
seals our realm

1027.67 --> 1034.3500000000001
that's just technically not there so

1030.79 --> 1034.35
there you go that's my proof

1036.1 --> 1047.539
it's not scientific proof but it's

1039.23 --> 1050.33
pretty much everything else just take as

1047.539 --> 1053.48
much data as you can and just put it all

1050.33 --> 1056.059
together and then draw a logical

1053.48 --> 1058.94
conclusions and even you can even use

1056.059 --> 1063.289
math and geometry as an assistance to

1058.94 --> 1068.1200000000001
basically include exclude options with

1063.289 --> 1070.58
that based on just firm logic logical

1068.12 --> 1072.9799999999998
deduction but yeah there's not it's not

1070.58 --> 1076.4189999999999
scientific proof of course but that's

1072.98 --> 1076.419
just physically impossible

1078.07 --> 1084.23
there could be elements that could be

1080.659 --> 1086.8990000000001
scientifically proven potentially but

1084.23 --> 1091.279
just the concept of shape of Earth

1086.899 --> 1097.6589999999999
that's not a shape is basically not

1091.279 --> 1097.659
scientifically provable geometry is is

1101.32 --> 1110.87
spatial mathematics in the conceptual

1106.19 --> 1114.159
realm it's very useful extremely useful

1110.87 --> 1119.09
assistant in in grasping things and and

1114.159 --> 1121.49
building but it's conceptual it Deacon's

1119.09 --> 1125.1999999999998
it remains conceptual so you can't

1121.49 --> 1125.2
really scientifically prove sheep

1130.66 --> 1134.0500000000002
[Music]

1131.95 --> 1136.3300000000002
but you don't always need science to

1134.05 --> 1138.1599999999999
prove everything although yeah it would

1136.33 --> 1141.6999999999998
have been very handy in case of the

1138.16 --> 1147.0
shape of the earth but it wasn't meant

1141.7 --> 1150.82
to be hey good morning chocolate saying

1147.0 --> 1154.68
to see you again see you got a lot of

1150.82 --> 1154.6799999999998
other people in chat as well

1166.98 --> 1176.65
Dave Johnson flattered warrior Karen be

1171.9 --> 1182.14
million Dexter has misty peanuts Clark

1176.65 --> 1184.8000000000002
tried to hand the youth to build G

1182.14 --> 1184.8000000000002
earlier I think

1195.73 --> 1200.6200000000001
all right so one of them in up to

1198.26 --> 1200.62
yesterday

1208.93 --> 1217.65
all right yeah lift of hill again I for

1213.04 --> 1217.6499999999999
some reason I'm just hooked on that guy

1219.51 --> 1225.91
apparently yeah project Veritas I don't

1224.08 --> 1228.04
know if you've heard about this but it

1225.91 --> 1232.2
almost seems like Project Veritas is

1228.04 --> 1236.23
like it it is taken as a huge deal

1232.2 --> 1240.07
because it was basically a leak from

1236.23 --> 1245.8600000000001
inside Google to project Veritas it was

1240.07 --> 1249.75
an anonymous about yeah I think you'd

1245.86 --> 1255.25
call it criminal conduct political

1249.75 --> 1257.02
meddling very obviously so and yeah they

1255.25 --> 1259.93
were of course taken down from YouTube

1257.02 --> 1262.81
that's not unexpected but now apparently

1259.93 --> 1264.8200000000002
also from other video platforms so it

1262.81 --> 1266.98
was kind of backed up on Vimeo and

1264.82 --> 1270.97
apparently and that is now deleted as

1266.98 --> 1272.74
well so that's unusual because Google

1270.97 --> 1274.6000000000001
usually just censors on their own

1272.74 --> 1276.99
platform but now apparently they are

1274.6 --> 1283.6
really putting effort to make everything

1276.99 --> 1286.42
hide that particular video and I've seen

1283.6 --> 1288.49
it and even though I didn't like absorb

1286.42 --> 1291.0700000000002
every single detail of it so that I can

1288.49 --> 1294.18
give it all back I did get the overall

1291.07 --> 1300.73
gist of it and it was pretty tough for

1294.18 --> 1303.55
Google and I think it's not gonna last

1300.73 --> 1305.08
long and I'm actually starting I've even

1303.55 --> 1310.93
starting to think from other angles

1305.08 --> 1312.1
again and for example a political angle

1310.93 --> 1314.5600000000002
let's just say Trump

1312.1 --> 1317.56
okay now Trump there's all this issue

1314.56 --> 1321.1599999999999
concerning Trump that it's always going

1317.56 --> 1323.02
back and forth and the guy does

1321.16 --> 1326.26
something's good and then he does some

1323.02 --> 1329.26
obvious things bad and then he's kind of

1326.26 --> 1334.21
a nice guy but he's also big

1329.26 --> 1336.61
disappointment inside it's such a it's

1334.21 --> 1338.26
not getting to an equilibrium any point

1336.61 --> 1340.24
soon that's just says like that it's

1338.26 --> 1341.85
just turbulence and it just keeps on

1340.24 --> 1343.77
going and

1341.85 --> 1345.299
I don't know maybe Trump likes it that

1343.77 --> 1348.929
way maybe he's doing that on purpose

1345.299 --> 1354.179
maybe that is part of what he does it's

1348.929 --> 1356.929
weird but I've just been thinking well

1354.179 --> 1361.919
now this is coming out right these leaks

1356.929 --> 1364.3200000000002
the Machine the the D Pro Trump machine

1361.919 --> 1366.929
with which I'm not really totally

1364.32 --> 1371.1299999999999
opposed or anything you know I still

1366.929 --> 1374.94
kind of have Pro Trump it's just nothing

1371.13 --> 1378.2890000000002
is really of course what it was

1374.94 --> 1381.0
pretending to be at first but still yeah

1378.289 --> 1383.46
from all the options you gotta go

1381.0 --> 1385.86
somewhere like that and you shouldn't

1383.46 --> 1387.27
tolerate anything I'm not gonna go for

1385.86 --> 1389.6299999999999
'anarchist on this so I'm just gonna

1387.27 --> 1393.45
look at it from Trump's side and I think

1389.63 --> 1395.94
there is some hassle and so he's gonna

1393.45 --> 1399.299
have to do some kind of action to make

1395.94 --> 1403.38
up for it and I think this is what he's

1399.299 --> 1407.25
gonna do I think that pretty much a

1403.38 --> 1410.13
short period before the elections he's

1407.25 --> 1412.59
gonna take down Google hard hard style

1410.13 --> 1414.45
and that's gonna impress everybody so

1412.59 --> 1416.49
much and that it's gonna probably

1414.45 --> 1419.82
already has a plan in the working still

1416.49 --> 1423.059
literally yeah replace all these people

1419.82 --> 1425.9399999999998
and really put free speech back kind of

1423.059 --> 1428.73
as it was and that's gonna make people

1425.94 --> 1431.01
so ecstatic to finally have their

1428.73 --> 1435.8700000000001
freedom of speech back at least on the

1431.01 --> 1438.24
internet that if he does that his yeah

1435.87 --> 1440.76
his reelection who absolutely be

1438.24 --> 1443.88
guaranteed there's no chance that if he

1440.76 --> 1447.99
does that at the right time and now we

1443.88 --> 1452.22
know that the leak is there it's being

1447.99 --> 1454.89
hidden but yeah they got it it's it's

1452.22 --> 1455.669
just a set I'm pretty damn sure this is

1454.89 --> 1458.4
gonna happen

1455.669 --> 1461.63
can they say exactly when maybe a month

1458.4 --> 1465.8400000000001
before the election maybe a week maybe

1461.63 --> 1467.49
it's gonna happen somewhere within a

1465.84 --> 1470.01
half year before it I don't know exactly

1467.49 --> 1472.73
but it is gonna happen before the

1470.01 --> 1472.73
election all

1474.03 --> 1478.3899999999999
if I'd have sufficient money to bet on

1478.21 --> 1484.39
it

1478.39 --> 1488.5
I'd do it at this point yeah Google has

1484.39 --> 1492.2800000000002
some explaining to do indeed and besides

1488.5 --> 1495.13
the YouTube and Google's policies have

1492.28 --> 1498.69
become quite insane they've put some

1495.13 --> 1501.7600000000002
really naughty people in control of

1498.69 --> 1503.5900000000001
social management some really nutty

1501.76 --> 1513.18
people I don't know if you've seen them

1503.59 --> 1516.73
but it's freaky it's like social justice

1513.18 --> 1519.22
warrior graduates that are like really

1516.73 --> 1523.0
fanatical and that have just taken on

1519.22 --> 1524.53
these huge responsibility roles but the

1523.0 --> 1527.32
only thing they really care about is

1524.53 --> 1532.84
just being social justice warrior ish

1527.32 --> 1535.96
and don't really care about they're not

1532.84 --> 1538.12
really managing things on the long run

1535.96 --> 1540.88
they're not really being responsible and

1538.12 --> 1543.6399999999999
that's the idiotic part about it's only

1540.88 --> 1545.92
because of that social justice consensus

1543.64 --> 1548.47
feeling that they're really trying to

1545.92 --> 1551.5900000000001
that they apparently let in Google let

1548.47 --> 1554.8500000000001
in YouTube that is allowing all that to

1551.59 --> 1559.51
keep on going so it's like an infection

1554.85 --> 1561.1899999999998
with a bunch of nutty people and I'm

1559.51 --> 1563.02
probably gonna get flagged for this or

1561.19 --> 1569.65
something I wouldn't be surprised

1563.02 --> 1572.47
sorry you know look I I'm not even

1569.65 --> 1576.48
against 90 people I'm just against 90

1572.47 --> 1580.98
people that are given significant power

1576.48 --> 1584.77
without obvious proof that they can be

1580.98 --> 1587.8
responsible to the wider public and not

1584.77 --> 1589.54
just to their political group and by the

1587.8 --> 1594.51
way they're not responsible to their

1589.54 --> 1599.23
political group they're like overly like

1594.51 --> 1601.87
just maniacally tolerant to what they

1599.23 --> 1604.5
perceive as their group so it's totally

1601.87 --> 1604.5
out of balance

1604.89 --> 1611.64
and yeah it needs to be replaced these

1608.28 --> 1613.98
these types of people just need to go

1611.64 --> 1616.5590000000002
get another type of job where they where

1613.98 --> 1619.2
they don't have social control because

1616.559 --> 1622.77
they're just gonna ruin everything just

1619.2 --> 1625.049
get a real job look who's talking

1622.77 --> 1629.49
well I'm talking talking in this case is

1625.049 --> 1631.32
my job see if I get them monetize for

1629.49 --> 1633.24
that well if that happens look if

1631.32 --> 1635.76
they're really gonna get on my ass for

1633.24 --> 1638.04
this then I will just wrench out to the

1635.76 --> 1643.5
other things you know at this point it's

1638.04 --> 1646.8899999999999
not even that tough to do but yeah this

1643.5 --> 1649.11
is gonna happen so if I were these

1646.89 --> 1651.419
people especially the social justice

1649.11 --> 1654.0
fanatics that have made let their

1651.419 --> 1654.929
political views make a lot of radical

1654.0 --> 1659.1
decisions

1654.929 --> 1661.919
I think they better start figuring out a

1659.1 --> 1664.11
new type of career not another job

1661.919 --> 1665.94
because I'm pretty sure that after this

1664.11 --> 1669.09
ends they're not gonna get another job

1665.94 --> 1672.5700000000002
in this type of field ever again cuz

1669.09 --> 1674.4599999999998
they're gonna be just severely shamed my

1672.57 --> 1675.8999999999999
they might if they go to another country

1674.46 --> 1678.21
or something who knows

1675.9 --> 1684.51
I give them little chance I'd I try to

1678.21 --> 1686.19
find a new type of career and I'd

1684.51 --> 1688.32
already started thinking about it

1686.19 --> 1695.3700000000001
seriously it's it's for the best for

1688.32 --> 1697.98
yourself you know I'm not gonna leave

1695.37 --> 1700.799
you to peanuts Clark I'm just saying if

1697.98 --> 1706.2
they're gonna get hard on me and make it

1700.799 --> 1712.11
impossible for me to basically yeah get

1706.2 --> 1715.02
around and grow and they have I can't

1712.11 --> 1719.87
say they've totally suppressed me but

1715.02 --> 1722.76
there's there's they have certainly

1719.87 --> 1726.1689999999999
narrowed down the amount of public that

1722.76 --> 1729.69
that gets to see me and they liked

1726.169 --> 1732.0900000000001
instead funnel a lot of trolls to my

1729.69 --> 1734.309
channel at times especially whenever

1732.09 --> 1735.54
they really have like almost the

1734.309 --> 1738.73
algorithm seems to have like a

1735.54 --> 1742.96
punishment policy where if I bring up so

1738.73 --> 1745.54
subjects at sensitive times then they

1742.96 --> 1749.83
will literally start forwarding trolls

1745.54 --> 1752.29
to me I'm pretty sure that happens for

1749.83 --> 1760.51
real it's not a joke it's not paranoia

1752.29 --> 1763.809
it's just a sign it happens so and I do

1760.51 --> 1765.22
wonder at times look I I have now it

1763.809 --> 1767.3799999999999
might immediately go down but I

1765.22 --> 1769.51
currently have a thousand three hundred

1767.38 --> 1776.5200000000002
and fifty two subscribers you can see it

1769.51 --> 1776.52
in the corner of the video screen and

1778.29 --> 1789.07
that's like three hundred in a season

1784.71 --> 1791.25
for a Daily Show with all the exposure

1789.07 --> 1793.51
from all the other channels that have

1791.25 --> 1799.15
potentially tens of thousand hundreds of

1793.51 --> 1801.46
thousands does that seem logical I don't

1799.15 --> 1803.98
care it's like I don't mind I got

1801.46 --> 1806.41
monetization now it's all fine I don't

1803.98 --> 1808.24
necessarily need the next level or

1806.41 --> 1810.8200000000002
anything I'm just fine with this for now

1808.24 --> 1814.0
but I'm just saying it does seem like

1810.82 --> 1816.57
you to kind of narrows it down and maybe

1814.0 --> 1819.79
that'd be for the best

1816.57 --> 1821.59
that is the safer approach because if

1819.79 --> 1826.21
they would literally strangle me I'd

1821.59 --> 1828.9399999999998
probably get like really really

1826.21 --> 1831.25
aggressive back in some way not

1828.94 --> 1835.3300000000002
physically but just like more tenacious

1831.25 --> 1837.78
I would probably say like oh really well

1835.33 --> 1840.1599999999999
if I'm gonna get censored like that that

1837.78 --> 1843.84
technically means that I can now brag

1840.16 --> 1846.91
about being censored by this hostile

1843.84 --> 1848.77
group and they'll only give me more

1846.91 --> 1850.5400000000002
credit if I when I'm gonna start up

1848.77 --> 1852.19
another platform so maybe that's the

1850.54 --> 1855.1
reason by it why'd it just let me do

1852.19 --> 1858.3400000000001
what I do I don't go out of control

1855.1 --> 1860.11
overblown crazy with [Â __Â ] anyway

1858.34 --> 1862.72
maybe a little emotional every now and

1860.11 --> 1864.28
then but I still compare to a lot of

1862.72 --> 1869.46
youtubers out there have a lot of

1864.28 --> 1873.03
discipline over what I let out so

1869.46 --> 1876.66
I don't know but yeah I definitely

1873.03 --> 1882.18
willing to branch out in some way the

1876.66 --> 1883.92
twitch and 2d life and I read it OBS is

1882.18 --> 1886.98
suitable for that the only problem so

1883.92 --> 1890.16
far is that you can't basically branch

1886.98 --> 1891.51
the stream to all three platforms and

1890.16 --> 1893.6100000000001
they're more out there that I could

1891.51 --> 1896.55
probably add on to that but I can branch

1893.61 --> 1897.8999999999999
it out the OBS doesn't allow that and if

1896.55 --> 1902.4199999999998
somebody out there that's really

1897.9 --> 1907.6200000000001
familiar with this kind of social media

1902.42 --> 1910.5
software please contact me or tell me

1907.62 --> 1912.8999999999999
right out but preferably contact me on

1910.5 --> 1915.69
skype and tell me if you know any kind

1912.9 --> 1917.88
of add-on software that hopefully could

1915.69 --> 1923.64
be free or a one-time payment not too

1917.88 --> 1928.74
insanely high that could allow a a multi

1923.64 --> 1931.0800000000002
branch output like add-on added on to

1928.74 --> 1933.78
OBS please let me know I would very much

1931.08 --> 1936.12
appreciate it because if I got it then I

1933.78 --> 1937.56
will definitely just start streaming on

1936.12 --> 1939.6299999999999
the other platform see what happens

1937.56 --> 1943.26
there see how many people will get onto

1939.63 --> 1947.88
there like D life and twitch are known

1943.26 --> 1951.09
to not what to have absolute free speech

1947.88 --> 1956.5800000000002
pretty much except for serious violence

1951.09 --> 1959.6699999999998
and they don't have so yeah such a

1956.58 --> 1963.09
manipulative suggested suggestion based

1959.67 --> 1965.4
algorithm so I'm just wondering will it

1963.09 --> 1967.26
be the same rate is it really the only

1965.4 --> 1971.64
that amount of people that can basically

1967.26 --> 1973.62
stand me and and like me or is it really

1971.64 --> 1977.96
Google that has been slowing me down so

1973.62 --> 1977.9599999999998
far so I'm very curious to find out

1980.68 --> 1983.68
mmm

2000.48 --> 2012.4
yeah I agree Karen beat it was say you

2010.27 --> 2014.47
do have like this talent always to

2012.4 --> 2016.6000000000001
attract these types of behavior from

2014.47 --> 2020.05
trolls for some reason I don't know what

2016.6 --> 2024.48
it is but every time you get in chat

2020.05 --> 2024.48
they get like this it's weird

2033.799 --> 2041.879
look flatout warrior stop pestering

2037.82 --> 2046.95
karin be please all of you just stop

2041.879 --> 2049.44
doing that it's really annoying and what

2046.95 --> 2051.69
what is this about oooh supporting

2049.44 --> 2054.389
people talking about an ice wall and a

2051.69 --> 2057.21
dome what's the problem if people want

2054.389 --> 2059.9700000000003
to speculate about that Orie look even

2057.21 --> 2061.919
if they want to accept that that must be

2059.97 --> 2064.859
the truth which would be a pseudo

2061.919 --> 2066.3289999999997
science-based assumption right because

2064.859 --> 2069.21
they don't have the data they're just

2066.329 --> 2074.159
assuming it but what is even wrong with

2069.21 --> 2077.19
that if they want to do that I don't see

2074.159 --> 2079.679
the issue as long as when they're

2077.19 --> 2082.039
confronted with well somebody like me

2079.679 --> 2084.9900000000002
they'll actually tell them look it's

2082.039 --> 2088.079
it's technically pseudoscience the you

2084.99 --> 2090.299
are presupposing certain elements and if

2088.079 --> 2091.679
they can't get honest at such point and

2090.299 --> 2092.909
they're going to be like oh you don't

2091.679 --> 2094.46
know what you're talking about and

2092.909 --> 2097.17
they're going to be all baller

2094.46 --> 2104.279
deflective like yeah then it will be

2097.17 --> 2105.779
like okay these people are yeah they're

2104.279 --> 2108.24
get it yeah

2105.779 --> 2113.15
not ballers but discourse then they

2108.24 --> 2113.1499999999996
become yeah pseudoscience discourse

2120.68 --> 2132.0299999999997
yeah what Karen be look you know that

2126.32 --> 2135.42
what they say about us includes things

2132.03 --> 2139.5800000000004
that are far worse than that okay

2135.42 --> 2144.48
they'll be writing just this insane

2139.58 --> 2146.46
demonic otherworldly beast fantasies

2144.48 --> 2148.02
about us if they could if they allow

2146.46 --> 2148.89
themselves to go there they'll go

2148.02 --> 2152.07
anywhere

2148.89 --> 2156.2999999999997
it's basically fanfare troll fanfiction

2152.07 --> 2160.05
at this point in any aspect any aspects

2156.3 --> 2163.17
can be you take of that and you're gonna

2160.05 --> 2166.4700000000003
fight that the only thing that's that

2163.17 --> 2170.88
that that's effectively gonna do is give

2166.47 --> 2173.1899999999996
them a weapon to battle you with because

2170.88 --> 2178.1600000000003
apparently if they keep on saying that

2173.19 --> 2179.31
you will keep on trying to stop that and

2178.16 --> 2184.5899999999997
yeah

2179.31 --> 2185.07
engage I never respond to that kind of

2184.59 --> 2187.5
[Â __Â ]

2185.07 --> 2189.96
I may just outright delete it and ignore

2187.5 --> 2193.68
it but I never address it even and

2189.96 --> 2197.75
because I do that they stop doing it

2193.68 --> 2202.47
because these trolls that say that don't

2197.75 --> 2205.02
care whether it be true or not whether

2202.47 --> 2207.2999999999997
we really are a cult or not they don't

2205.02 --> 2210.84
care the only thing they really care

2207.3 --> 2214.26
about is if you're gonna respond to the

2210.84 --> 2219.9
content that they present so you gotta

2214.26 --> 2224.07
stop stop the troll bait reflex there

2219.9 --> 2225.4700000000003
you gotta take away the power of their

2224.07 --> 2228.48
words

2225.47 --> 2234.45
Karen be please take my advice on this

2228.48 --> 2237.53
please and please respond to me I'm

2234.45 --> 2237.5299999999997
addressing you directly

2241.77 --> 2245.85

2288.83 --> 2291.949
[Music]

2305.31 --> 2316.11
Yeah right the hand you're starting to

2308.82 --> 2318.9
become a serious pain in the ass you've

2316.11 --> 2326.34
been acting like this for days why don't

2318.9 --> 2328.38
you drop it like is this guy even like a

2326.34 --> 2331.02
flat earther I thought he kind of was

2328.38 --> 2335.48
but maybe he is just a freaking ball or

2331.02 --> 2335.48
troll I don't know what it is with him

2344.48 --> 2348.289
[Music]

2350.8 --> 2360.23
[Music]

2365.559 --> 2374.4500000000003
not cool nice to hear that one guy Wow

2369.619 --> 2378.17
5:00 a.m. so you're like a series early

2374.45 --> 2381.6499999999996
are you like in California because you'd

2378.17 --> 2388.96
have to be or maybe Alaska for it to be

2381.65 --> 2394.2490000000003
that early man are you like in some

2388.96 --> 2398.589
certain industry or like mining or

2394.249 --> 2398.589
something to get up that freaking early

2399.13 --> 2412.2490000000003
in the oil business a fishery I don't

2406.099 --> 2416.98
know Washington State yeah yeah well

2412.249 --> 2416.98
that's that's also extremely West

2427.299 --> 2440.469
Oh mind-warped oh that's very sneaky of

2438.489 --> 2443.709
you you basically asked for a wrench

2440.469 --> 2445.959
without asking for a wrench I have to

2443.709 --> 2450.399
respect that because technically you did

2445.959 --> 2460.479
abide by the rules and I do appreciate

2450.399 --> 2462.249
you so I might give you one whoa okay

2460.479 --> 2470.8799999999997
yeah you are in construction that one

2462.249 --> 2470.8799999999997
guy build dams dam it's impressive

2476.99 --> 2486.91
yeah you know what James Mason you're an

2480.2 --> 2486.91
awesome guy I think you super chatted me

2487.45 --> 2491.83
some time ago so you get one

2501.52 --> 2504.739
[Music]

2511.31 --> 2520.4
yeah okay against better judgment I

2516.82 --> 2523.96
shouldn't I kind of wanted to give you a

2520.4 --> 2523.96
wrench anyway mind-warped so

2532.32 --> 2539.8500000000004
yeah peanuts Clark I am in a very good

2534.69 --> 2545.04
mood reflected in several ways and not

2539.85 --> 2548.0099999999998
trying to brag but I just when I feel

2545.04 --> 2550.95
really good I kind of also do like feel

2548.01 --> 2555.09
compelled to do just small good things

2550.95 --> 2557.04
and it's just very rewarding so I kind

2555.09 --> 2560.52
of felt good in retrospect in how I

2557.04 --> 2562.44
handled that situation yesterday where

2560.52 --> 2566.4
that girl came sitting right next to me

2562.44 --> 2568.86
it was basically sort of like got the

2566.4 --> 2571.65
feeling trying to indecently seduced me

2568.86 --> 2575.1600000000003
passively it was weird I don't know but

2571.65 --> 2578.13
I thought that I just did really well

2575.16 --> 2581.58
and that I did feel like this is a

2578.13 --> 2584.88
tricky setup she might be trying to

2581.58 --> 2587.64
trick me into doing something stupid and

2584.88 --> 2590.85
then make me into some kind of full guy

2587.64 --> 2594.14
for something and I talked about it with

2590.85 --> 2601.56
good friends and they agreed with me and

2594.14 --> 2603.33
I I have no idea why bear but I don't

2601.56 --> 2605.94
think it's gonna turn out into something

2603.33 --> 2608.31
but I felt good about it that I

2605.94 --> 2610.86
basically turned away and just didn't

2608.31 --> 2612.96
engage because she said that she had a

2610.86 --> 2616.9500000000003
boyfriend but still was gonna sit next

2612.96 --> 2619.08
to me and I just did the right thing

2616.95 --> 2621.33
felt good for it maybe like the logos

2619.08 --> 2623.25
God or whatever rewarded me for doing

2621.33 --> 2628.17
the right thing felt really good this

2623.25 --> 2632.28
morning and yeah I was sitting in a park

2628.17 --> 2634.59
and a yeah a certain homeless guy and

2632.28 --> 2636.09
now there's homeless people and there's

2634.59 --> 2639.09
homeless people there are some in

2636.09 --> 2642.0
Utrecht but very little really it's

2639.09 --> 2643.4100000000003
nothing like 20 years ago for example so

2642.0 --> 2646.17
there are a couple that hang around in

2643.41 --> 2650.0099999999998
typical locations and there's this one

2646.17 --> 2654.12
guy that's like really cute he's very

2650.01 --> 2656.82
quiet he's kind of old very quiet and

2654.12 --> 2659.7
like he does back but he's like very

2656.82 --> 2662.5800000000004
modest and if you just say no he doesn't

2659.7 --> 2665.779
get pushy at all he's just so cute in a

2662.58 --> 2668.94
way like I don't know it's we

2665.779 --> 2670.319
but yeah that makes me want to give him

2668.94 --> 2673.289
more if I got anything and he was

2670.319 --> 2675.42
sitting there in heat like I was like

2673.289 --> 2679.2000000000003
okay I'm gonna get him a bottle of water

2675.42 --> 2683.01
and I did that like fresh from the

2679.2 --> 2685.5
cooler and he was like oh my god so that

2683.01 --> 2687.8390000000004
was just made me feel good just so small

2685.5 --> 2692.579
little thing but yeah water in this heat

2687.839 --> 2698.5789999999997
you know people forget about it and

2692.579 --> 2699.779
really need it ah dude I don't know what

2698.579 --> 2702.42
else to describe it

2699.779 --> 2706.769
maybe adorable I don't know it's just

2702.42 --> 2707.369
like a cute old man like a really nice

2706.769 --> 2711.8999999999996
one

2707.369 --> 2716.359
you know what else do I know God

2711.9 --> 2716.359
CGI ranty you had to bring in

2724.89 --> 2730.859
okay I think maybe the right way to

2727.89 --> 2740.5789999999997
phrase it is a sweet old man right a

2730.859 --> 2743.489
sweet old man sorry okay guys so let it

2740.579 --> 2745.8590000000004
be understood that that was definitely a

2743.489 --> 2754.559
language barrier misunderstanding thing

2745.859 --> 2756.779
okay right but I'm kind of glad that I'm

2754.559 --> 2759.059
being pointed at it because sometimes I

2756.779 --> 2761.039
do use words in a way that are

2759.059 --> 2763.65
technically correct but are kind of off

2761.039 --> 2765.5690000000004
and it's good to be pointed at that to

2763.65 --> 2769.6800000000003
get some criticism because I do want to

2765.569 --> 2773.66
say things exactly right whenever I can

2769.68 --> 2782.39
I want to keep on growing in my

2773.66 --> 2786.14
english-speaking wielding skills so dude

2782.39 --> 2786.14
that's just disgusting

2795.4 --> 2800.0190000000002
Thank You white bear I do my best

2802.13 --> 2812.4790000000003
one thing that has started to kind of

2806.539 --> 2816.0490000000004
stand out with me is the more I try to

2812.479 --> 2817.6699999999996
refine actually finding the right words

2816.049 --> 2822.049
with everything I say

2817.67 --> 2827.4500000000003
does take away a little bit of my focus

2822.049 --> 2830.869
on my pronunciation pronunciation and

2827.45 --> 2835.43
that's I am kind of disappointed at that

2830.869 --> 2838.039
sometimes but it is just as tempting I

2835.43 --> 2840.3999999999996
guess spend more attention on the actual

2838.039 --> 2843.4700000000003
English language than even on my

2840.4 --> 2848.4790000000003
pronunciation but I should do that a

2843.47 --> 2853.45
little bit more just to get that refined

2848.479 --> 2853.45
as well it's it's really difficult

2857.22 --> 2863.819
right thanks maybe it's not the

2861.39 --> 2865.94
pronunciation I think my pronunciation

2863.819 --> 2869.22
is probably good enough

2865.94 --> 2872.4900000000002
probably even by English standards it's

2869.22 --> 2876.66
more the articulation because sometimes

2872.49 --> 2878.64
we get some booth it's like piece of my

2876.66 --> 2880.41
jaw slips mid-sentence that kind of

2878.64 --> 2893.73
thing that's really annoying I don't

2880.41 --> 2896.81
like it when I do that but they could

2893.73 --> 2901.65
like do a speech warm-up training

2896.81 --> 2903.72
ohohoho that weird thing let's not give

2901.65 --> 2907.609
the weirdoes out there more video

2903.72 --> 2907.609
material for troll videos

2919.42 --> 2929.609
okay right bilji well basically the

2924.099 --> 2932.4100000000003
YouTube communication goes through my

2929.609 --> 2937.029
the same addresses is my paypal email

2932.41 --> 2941.3689999999997
and that's yeah Arwen 33 at gmail.com

2937.029 --> 2941.369
you can see send emails there

2947.19 --> 2953.3
Wow okay now you're starting to make me

2950.01 --> 2953.3
blush they're calling Turner

2969.48 --> 2978.85
hmm.well Mindwarp i don't know about

2972.7 --> 2982.81
that i think that for the short run

2978.85 --> 2985.48
bitcoin is absolutely stunningly well or

2982.81 --> 2988.12
not as much even bitcoin as just all the

2985.48 --> 2990.97
coins i think bitcoin is already

2988.12 --> 2993.16
compromised it's already being dumped

2990.97 --> 2997.12
and dumped and all that stuff by the

2993.16 --> 3001.23
mighty one so it's not it's no longer

2997.12 --> 3005.31
really viable as an as a safe investment

3001.23 --> 3009.57
strategy but cryptocurrency definitely

3005.31 --> 3015.18
is it's in the boom but there isn't long

3009.57 --> 3018.8700000000003
term issue though I don't know exactly

3015.18 --> 3022.02
if I get look I am NOT like a Max Keiser

3018.87 --> 3026.4
that really gets into the statistics of

3022.02 --> 3028.35
financial research I do like look into

3026.4 --> 3031.17
these guys and just hear what they say

3028.35 --> 3034.86
get a feel for it that's how I approach

3031.17 --> 3038.4
it mostly so don't take me as a direct

3034.86 --> 3041.51
financial advice in this case what I

3038.4 --> 3047.73
think that because of the cryptocurrency

3041.51 --> 3050.4900000000002
explosion there is a risk that kind of

3047.73 --> 3053.79
could be similar to what happens when

3050.49 --> 3056.5499999999997
money is over printed and then spread

3053.79 --> 3059.67
out I think that because of the massive

3056.55 --> 3061.32
amounts of the quantity of the

3059.67 --> 3064.8
cryptocurrencies that are certainly

3061.32 --> 3069.3900000000003
gonna be out there that well of course

3064.8 --> 3074.4900000000002
it is gonna probably eventually like

3069.39 --> 3079.14
fizzle out the a lot of the the printed

3074.49 --> 3081.3599999999997
the printed money but it will keep on

3079.14 --> 3083.8799999999997
growing and more will pop up and more

3081.36 --> 3086.28
and that's gonna probably cause some

3083.88 --> 3088.82
kind of inflation in the entirety and

3086.28 --> 3092.1600000000003
the problem is where is it gonna stop

3088.82 --> 3095.55
the growth might go so quick that the

3092.16 --> 3099.0299999999997
inflation can't catch up yeah that's a

3095.55 --> 3100.539
weird idea and what if that happens well

3099.03 --> 3104.799
what will happen prac

3100.539 --> 3107.0190000000002
Klee it is kind of like a sad after note

3104.799 --> 3110.709
after it all because there's really no

3107.019 --> 3114.209
way to bypass it or you have like really

3110.709 --> 3119.2889999999998
do radical changes and like default

3114.209 --> 3120.759
depth forgetting is all that but if it's

3119.289 --> 3123.8190000000004
just gonna jump to the cryptocurrency

3120.759 --> 3131.89
it's probably gonna get even more more

3123.819 --> 3135.4
feeble more liable then printed money

3131.89 --> 3137.2889999999998
then fiat currency be even though it's

3135.4 --> 3141.369
not at least going to be in the hands of

3137.289 --> 3144.309
a singular power group but the sheer

3141.369 --> 3146.079
amounts that are gonna potentially come

3144.309 --> 3148.4100000000003
out in cryptocurrency

3146.079 --> 3152.199
is probably just gonna flood everything

3148.41 --> 3154.8999999999996
causing massive devaluations in the

3152.199 --> 3156.279
cryptocurrencies and that's you don't I

3154.9 --> 3158.849
don't really know what the hell's gonna

3156.279 --> 3158.849
happen with that

3167.46 --> 3174.63
but yeah to be fair I definitely at

3172.29 --> 3177.0589999999997
least on the short run and gonna go on

3174.63 --> 3179.9100000000003
the on the cryptocurrency I basically

3177.059 --> 3184.92
forced it I have to do that it's the

3179.91 --> 3190.17
only way I can kind of expand my

3184.92 --> 3193.67
financial situation and try to get some

3190.17 --> 3196.5
kind of financial basis even with that

3193.67 --> 3200.16
get some businesses going or whatever

3196.5 --> 3204.65
trades or more get more serious so

3200.16 --> 3204.6499999999996
looking forward to trying all that out

3204.71 --> 3215.099
getting involved with markets and yeah

3212.43 --> 3221.1299999999997
Whitebear cryptocurrency is it is

3215.099 --> 3223.26
difficult it's not impossible to get but

3221.13 --> 3228.1800000000003
it is among the little bit more

3223.26 --> 3232.92
complicated things of this let's call it

3228.18 --> 3244.64
postmodern age oh yeah of the of this

3232.92 --> 3248.069
this new century it's I let me try to

3244.64 --> 3252.0
very clumsily colloquially try to

3248.069 --> 3253.109
explain it to a layman and there's going

3252.0 --> 3255.059
to be people out there that can

3253.109 --> 3257.52
definitely explain this a lot better but

3255.059 --> 3260.73
how I kind of see it is that

3257.52 --> 3263.49
cryptocurrency is like a banker's right

3260.73 --> 3266.88
to print your own fiat currency under

3263.49 --> 3271.589
specific conditions where the history

3266.88 --> 3279.42
and the origin is incorporated digitally

3271.589 --> 3285.5589999999997
within the code of it and that works for

3279.42 --> 3289.2200000000003
some reason so it is a banker's yeah a

3285.559 --> 3291.63
banker's privilege decentralized

3289.22 --> 3295.9199999999996
basically giving into the hands of

3291.63 --> 3298.5
anyone that'll try it and because there

3295.92 --> 3300.4500000000003
is a registry system within it that kind

3298.5 --> 3303.329
of makes it reliable on a collective

3300.45 --> 3307.25
level it's really fascinating it's a

3303.329 --> 3312.9900000000002
very new decentralized concept that is

3307.25 --> 3316.92
probably in a way so surreal that real

3312.99 --> 3320.4599999999996
old Olli harks and and the people that

3316.92 --> 3322.5
are just insanely rich are probably kind

3320.46 --> 3328.16
of nervous about it because they

3322.5 --> 3328.16
probably never expected this to come I

3328.609 --> 3334.89
don't think yeah they never expected to

3332.07 --> 3337.38
lose that control that money itself

3334.89 --> 3339.81
would migrate on out of their

3337.38 --> 3341.75
centralized hands naturally I don't

3339.81 --> 3345.81
think they ever saw that coming

3341.75 --> 3348.41
maybe some weird AI or visionary or

3345.81 --> 3351.7799999999997
shaman in the ancient times however that

3348.41 --> 3353.609
started did kind of tell them yeah it's

3351.78 --> 3356.6090000000004
gonna happen and they were just like I

3353.609 --> 3361.41
don't understand this I've gotta ignore

3356.609 --> 3364.29
it who knows but because of the nature

3361.41 --> 3367.98
and because of the long-term reliance of

3364.29 --> 3371.49
mega bankers and the ultra-rich relying

3367.98 --> 3377.73
on centralized control of money having

3371.49 --> 3380.64
that as a manipulation factor this puts

3377.73 --> 3383.369
that away while they have relied in

3380.64 --> 3386.46
their growth and in their control in

3383.369 --> 3390.119
their control system on that's for so

3386.46 --> 3394.109
long so it is to them a very big

3390.119 --> 3396.38
transition that this is happening do not

3394.109 --> 3396.38
underestimate

3408.29 --> 3413.75
right one thing that can also by the way

3412.1 --> 3416.42
come out of this all of this with a

3413.75 --> 3419.81
cryptocurrency and that is a risk is

3416.42 --> 3422.09
that mega-corporations that are left to

3419.81 --> 3426.14
run as they are and left to a call

3422.09 --> 3428.75
become really big and fast like a store

3426.14 --> 3431.0899999999997
that sells anything they could

3428.75 --> 3434.06
definitely and will at some point

3431.09 --> 3437.42
probably make their own store

3434.06 --> 3439.34
cryptocurrency that can then be

3437.42 --> 3441.77
basically like ooh you can save the

3439.34 --> 3443.3900000000003
cryptocurrency as points as bonus points

3441.77 --> 3446.06
and then eventually you could buy some

3443.39 --> 3450.2599999999998
and you can invest in it and buy stuff

3446.06 --> 3452.39
with it and then eventually you can even

3450.26 --> 3454.3100000000004
completely do everything with that

3452.39 --> 3457.22
specific cryptocurrency within that

3454.31 --> 3458.69
specific store chain and that is

3457.22 --> 3461.3599999999997
probably something that mega

3458.69 --> 3463.52
corporations are like water tea thing

3461.36 --> 3466.9700000000003
over like oh that the opportunity of

3463.52 --> 3469.88
getting a company's store once again

3466.97 --> 3475.0099999999998
through cryptocurrency you bet you they

3469.88 --> 3479.5
can do that and will I guarantee it it's

3475.01 --> 3479.5
gonna be a crypto company store

3485.26 --> 3493.09
and who knows maybe in the future it

3488.53 --> 3497.4100000000003
will be so systematic that it might even

3493.09 --> 3499.21
as let's let's look at business models I

3497.41 --> 3501.67
know it a little bit I haven't done a

3499.21 --> 3503.44
lot but I know a little about it so if

3501.67 --> 3507.1
you start a business I know this from my

3503.44 --> 3511.6
goldsmithing you have to tie in a bank

3507.1 --> 3513.1
account right it's mandated you can't

3511.6 --> 3514.06
start a business without registering

3513.1 --> 3516.52
your bank account

3514.06 --> 3521.08
and you have to have it in certain

3516.52 --> 3523.9
system Bob right so maybe that is going

3521.08 --> 3526.56
to change in the future it may be you

3523.9 --> 3533.14
have to have your own company

3526.56 --> 3535.63
cryptocurrency as part of business it

3533.14 --> 3542.83
might actually become a mandated

3535.63 --> 3545.77
standard at some point and it's

3542.83 --> 3548.14
interesting because that company

3545.77 --> 3551.65
cryptocurrency could become a direct

3548.14 --> 3554.83
indicator into the economy if it expands

3551.65 --> 3558.07
if that means more people are interested

3554.83 --> 3563.0499999999997
in that company so it could even be a

3558.07 --> 3568.7200000000003
very tangible economic indicator when

3563.05 --> 3572.23
that type of system is applied I'm kind

3568.72 --> 3576.8199999999997
of staggered that I'm literally now this

3572.23 --> 3579.97
is literally on the spot figuring this

3576.82 --> 3584.25
out seeing this looking at the options

3579.97 --> 3586.5099999999998
adds but yeah that could work

3584.25 --> 3588.84
cryptocurrencies for every company and

3586.51 --> 3592.5400000000004
then the cryptocurrency would basically

3588.84 --> 3598.03
reflect how much business the company is

3592.54 --> 3599.92
doing because of the natural amount of

3598.03 --> 3603.2200000000003
cryptocurrency that is going to be

3599.92 --> 3607.2400000000002
created in the process as the means of

3603.22 --> 3613.23
interaction so the more there is the

3607.24 --> 3613.2299999999996
better the company is doing fascinating

3619.17 --> 3628.26
hmm well Karen be a trust attacking tax

3624.27 --> 3632.549
exemption from a trust that that's not

3628.26 --> 3635.0690000000004
always just straight out like that it

3632.549 --> 3637.109
depends also per country I know it's

3635.069 --> 3638.73
kind of tough to get that kind of thing

3637.109 --> 3641.16
going in the Netherlands you even have

3638.73 --> 3644.79
to like pay outright for that kind of

3641.16 --> 3647.7599999999998
stuff so maybe it's a lot easier in

3644.79 --> 3651.9
America I don't know I'm not a tax

3647.76 --> 3654.4500000000003
expert I you have to ask the that girl

3651.9 --> 3656.19
that came walking to me yesterday she

3654.45 --> 3660.14
probably knows everything about that

3656.19 --> 3664.369
stuff if I ever speak to her again

3660.14 --> 3667.339
no flat-side Fe I never studied business

3664.369 --> 3670.109
weird isn't it I should have in

3667.339 --> 3673.77
retrospect oh my god I should have I

3670.109 --> 3676.799
feel so stupid that I didn't want to but

3673.77 --> 3681.809
I should have but I did talk to people I

3676.799 --> 3684.96
do hear out people I do listen to for

3681.809 --> 3689.9100000000003
example economic experts I have listened

3684.96 --> 3693.18
to Max Keiser since 2006 and I've even

3689.91 --> 3695.94
been subscribed to gerald Celente his

3693.18 --> 3700.5
private video streams that I quit

3695.94 --> 3705.27
eventually because it was too much but

3700.5 --> 3708.54
the also financial and markets news Thai

3705.27 --> 3711.15
people that are really smart and that

3708.54 --> 3714.75
really provably know what they're doing

3711.15 --> 3717.9300000000003
so I was always interested in the feel

3714.75 --> 3721.349
for business and market it's just that

3717.93 --> 3723.93
I'm not a type of guy or I think I have

3721.349 --> 3726.569
imposed on myself that I am NOT the kind

3723.93 --> 3728.2799999999997
of guy that actually will do the

3726.569 --> 3731.67
business himself

3728.28 --> 3734.28
I've been neurotically reluctant to

3731.67 --> 3737.46
really engage in that and instead focus

3734.28 --> 3739.3190000000004
on craft like goldsmithing always like

3737.46 --> 3740.9700000000003
just doing the craft I want to do the

3739.319 --> 3743.18
craft I want to think only about the

3740.97 --> 3750.27
vision and the craft and the energies

3743.18 --> 3752.74
that's that's what happened every time

3750.27 --> 3754.15
what I should really get more into

3752.74 --> 3756.5499999999997
business and I think that as soon

3754.15 --> 3761.35
especially with the cryptocurrency thing

3756.55 --> 3763.6000000000004
now about a pop for me it's just gonna

3761.35 --> 3766.87
happen I'm just gonna get involved in

3763.6 --> 3769.6
this stuff may actually buy things like

3766.87 --> 3774.85
bombs and companies and try to get some

3769.6 --> 3777.3399999999997
input and really get going and actually

3774.85 --> 3779.3199999999997
actualize all this learning that I've

3777.34 --> 3781.81
been doing and all this feel that I've

3779.32 --> 3790.4500000000003
been getting for how things work and

3781.81 --> 3792.36
test it test the knowledge so I hope I

3790.45 --> 3796.6499999999996
haven't all bored you to death with this

3792.36 --> 3796.65
but I am I think it's interesting

3797.46 --> 3805.57
so yeah I'm gonna round out the show
