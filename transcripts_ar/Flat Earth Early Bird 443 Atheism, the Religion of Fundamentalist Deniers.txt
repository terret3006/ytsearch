the weather today is quite the switch

82.43 --> 92.41000000000001
around from yesterday it's rainy and

87.47 --> 92.41
it's cloudy oh well

98.92 --> 112.33
ya can't always be nice weather ah so

107.76 --> 114.75
yeah today I got for a change tumeric

112.33 --> 118.75
coffee with me I thought I probably

114.75 --> 120.479
wanted the second one and green tea I

118.75 --> 126.49
haven't poured anything yet though

120.479 --> 129.91
because yeah what's up pretty late like

126.49 --> 130.32999999999998
this oh got up in the afternoon it was

129.91 --> 133.54
weird

130.33 --> 140.14000000000001
I didn't even go back go to bed that

133.54 --> 142.42
late yesterday it's just it's weird like

140.14 --> 144.51899999999998
yesterday evening at some point I

142.42 --> 148.6
thought like yeah I want a freaking

144.519 --> 153.07
chocolate milk like I felt like it so I

148.6 --> 157.0
got an organic chocolate milk over out

153.07 --> 159.67
there at the culture boat where I also

157.0 --> 162.31
get cannabis sometimes not that office

159.67 --> 165.85
of my favorite job but it's so good but

162.31 --> 168.37
man I just yeah it was great it tasted

165.85 --> 171.73
great it was great with the cold because

168.37 --> 174.01
it is very cold like in the in the

171.73 --> 176.91
evening when it's dark and it's that

174.01 --> 182.53
clear as it was still yesterday evening

176.91 --> 185.079
but man it afterwards I kind of realized

182.53 --> 186.76
like deeper in the night that it is

185.079 --> 190.48000000000002
probably the first time I've been

186.76 --> 193.989
drinking any kind of milk related

190.48 --> 198.01
product in any way and I didn't handle

193.989 --> 199.93
it that well like I almost at some point

198.01 --> 201.82
where it was way later but I almost

199.93 --> 204.64000000000001
threw up even it was we had a bad

201.82 --> 207.489
response to that because I don't eat I

204.64 --> 211.23899999999998
didn't even really notice that much but

207.489 --> 214.75
I I don't eat any kind of cheese anymore

211.239 --> 218.56
ever I did stop doing that tire lead

214.75 --> 221.53
since I went back to eating me I've just

218.56 --> 223.239
been avoiding any kind of milk in any

221.53 --> 225.26
form I don't take it in my coffee

223.239 --> 229.459
anymore I haven't done that long

225.26 --> 231.379
time no more cheese no more chocolate

229.459 --> 236.599
because I don't really like pure

231.379 --> 239.39
chocolate that much and well I have been

236.599 --> 243.82899999999998
I don't know I feel tired even though I

239.39 --> 247.76
actually slept pretty long I feel tired

243.829 --> 251.84
and I think it is because of that so

247.76 --> 254.17
yeah I guess it was good to try it out

251.84 --> 256.1
even without any having any

254.17 --> 258.199
psychosomatic obstacles like bad

256.1 --> 260.66
expectations I just thought no I want

258.199 --> 262.539
this I'll do it and then I got a bad

260.66 --> 267.77000000000004
response so this is just telling I

262.539 --> 270.52
wasn't psychosomatic I just don't

267.77 --> 274.09999999999997
respond to it anymore

270.52 --> 282.19899999999996
well so I'm just gonna completely scrap

274.1 --> 283.72900000000004
it out oh geez bad soft cheese good I

282.199 --> 286.34000000000003
don't know I don't know about that

283.729 --> 287.63
jilted flame I'm not even gonna try it

286.34 --> 292.54999999999995
out anymore you know there's gonna be

287.63 --> 296.81
some cheese taste here and there on

292.55 --> 301.58
certain types of foods but it is the

296.81 --> 304.93
actual I guess the the real milk based

301.58 --> 309.37
substance that I don't respond to well

304.93 --> 309.37
not so much the cheese taste

316.06 --> 324.79
bad Fran I disagree I disagree yell

319.42 --> 327.03000000000003
decline it it all depends on the nature

324.79 --> 331.12
of the cheese and if your body can

327.03 --> 334.23999999999995
digest it properly you know you if that

331.12 --> 340.53000000000003
is the case then know if it's all good

334.24 --> 343.69
organic if the if there's no no junk

340.53 --> 346.23999999999995
remnants left over in the milk in the

343.69 --> 350.14
cheese from everything that the animal

346.24 --> 355.33
has eaten it all know then it won't be

350.14 --> 360.96999999999997
bad the fat that is parsley so bad in

355.33 --> 364.39
hard cheese right it may actually be yea

360.97 --> 367.48
good fat if it's just really well made

364.39 --> 369.59999999999997
organic cheese with no added on junk in

367.48 --> 369.6
it

373.41 --> 381.40000000000003
right

375.7 --> 383.76
yeah that's right flatter spaceman but I

381.4 --> 386.5
don't drink too much alcohol you know

383.76 --> 391.18
but I don't have that kind of response

386.5 --> 395.56
to it and smoking weed is the same you

391.18 --> 398.23
know can smoke too much but it's not

395.56 --> 401.75
gonna have such a impact on my

398.23 --> 404.81
metabolism so yeah it's just different

401.75 --> 404.81
[Music]

407.39 --> 410.76
[Music]

429.01 --> 435.61
all right well the other client look

432.49 --> 439.42
there's all these ideas of whether

435.61 --> 442.69
certain foods are bad or good from

439.42 --> 445.09000000000003
different angles I just go with okay if

442.69 --> 448.66
you don't have any physiological bad

445.09 --> 452.46999999999997
responses to milk products then cheese

448.66 --> 457.59000000000003
is just fine as long as you don't overdo

452.47 --> 460.54
it in your diet that's it

457.59 --> 463.17999999999995
don't do too much then eat it too much

460.54 --> 466.57
in your meals don't let it be a majority

463.18 --> 469.36
percentage as it were but you can add on

466.57 --> 472.09
stuff and it's pretty yeah it's fine and

469.36 --> 477.09000000000003
the same kind of goes for meats if you

472.09 --> 481.06
eat meat then don't just eat meat and

477.09 --> 483.21999999999997
some other stuff on the side don't make

481.06 --> 487.21
it the majority percentage you like

483.22 --> 493.59000000000003
always try to make vegetables some kind

487.21 --> 493.59
the majority because that's just better

498.8 --> 503.699
breathes in camembert well that's the

501.75 --> 507.86
really young young cheese

503.699 --> 512.339
yeah and that's I even learned this

507.86 --> 514.32
before I learned about organic food as

512.339 --> 517.08
it were because my mother kind of was

514.32 --> 520.529
into the really young type of almost

517.08 --> 524.029
yogurty Jesus because that was

520.529 --> 524.029
supposedly healthier

529.79 --> 535.5999999999999
so there's something to it there's

531.68 --> 539.9
something to eating like

535.6 --> 543.2
non-salary yogurt that's like almost

539.9 --> 545.24
natural yeah that's almost quark but

543.2 --> 548.33
it's not the fatty parts it's just the

545.24 --> 550.49
yogurt that's supposedly also like one

548.33 --> 554.3000000000001
of the more healthy type of milk

550.49 --> 557.0600000000001
products it can contain yeah certain

554.3 --> 561.17
bacterial flora that is good for your

557.06 --> 563.8399999999999
intestines and all but it's just a minor

561.17 --> 565.88
add on pretty much on in the big scale

563.84 --> 572.6
of what what else could be done to

565.88 --> 577.64
support your gut right

572.6 --> 591.22
anyway yeah it's all not really for me

577.64 --> 594.17
anymore anyway hey Adam akin right I

591.22 --> 595.69
should go for jet I almost forgot about

594.17 --> 598.81
that

595.69 --> 604.97
unbelievable productions was first

598.81 --> 610.4799999999999
letter space man Laurel jl Jewess stone

604.97 --> 620.6600000000001
monkey 3d Anthony Dickinson had a maken

610.48 --> 623.2
NCD 20 I point oh oh by 60 our MC and

620.66 --> 623.1999999999999
the Kline

624.51 --> 634.92
right Gideon sick say Jesus is yeah

632.17 --> 634.92
whatever

637.71 --> 643.63
now I disagree yogurt line you down need

640.81 --> 648.3399999999999
meat for your gut bacteria that's

643.63 --> 654.79
nonsense now what is claimed is that

648.34 --> 657.07
meat contains b12 vitamin right and that

654.79 --> 660.5799999999999
that is good but that's just it's a

657.07 --> 664.6500000000001
misinterpretation b12 can mostly be

660.58 --> 664.6500000000001
found really in Dart

670.22 --> 676.73
and you can find some of it in meat but

673.1 --> 679.22
that's yeah - Claire then claim that

676.73 --> 681.97
that is what you need meat for that's

679.22 --> 681.97
just not true

686.86 --> 697.48
if you're another way to get some b12 is

690.79 --> 700.8399999999999
not over wash your vegetables and for

697.48 --> 704.89
example don't peel your potatoes I don't

700.84 --> 706.21
peel my potatoes anymore that kind of

704.89 --> 711.8199999999999
thing

706.21 --> 711.82
[Music]

713.36 --> 717.279
it's flex pay Smith

723.43 --> 728.38
well I've stopped eating meat for two

725.44 --> 732.97
and a half years I think it's incredible

728.38 --> 737.62
long time really overall but I don't

732.97 --> 742.1800000000001
know I didn't really turn into it a dig

737.62 --> 744.43
I got pretty agitated at times but -

742.18 --> 746.4399999999999
then ascribe that purely to stop eating

744.43 --> 749.16
meat I don't know it was partially also

746.44 --> 751.5100000000001
because of just starting a Daily Show

749.16 --> 762.1
having to take on that new level of

751.51 --> 766.4399999999999
pressure so skin potatoes what no skin

762.1 --> 771.029
don't skin your potatoes and skinned

766.44 --> 774.58
leave the skin on when you cook it just

771.029 --> 779.13
eat it it's better it's a lot of good

774.58 --> 779.13
stuff in there and right beneath it

781.0 --> 784.159
[Music]

795.83 --> 798.7900000000001
oh right

811.75 --> 819.58
the really Thor logicoma gods human

815.84 --> 823.22
spent two million years evolving

819.58 --> 830.48
fascinating where are you getting that

823.22 --> 836.35
number from any proof of two million

830.48 --> 836.35
years of gut bacteria evolution

854.1 --> 857.149
[Music]

862.64 --> 865.75
[Music]

869.17 --> 875.4599999999999
all right

871.05 --> 879.38
oh really so humans spent two million

875.46 --> 883.7
years developing their gut flora right

879.38 --> 886.74
well in those 2 million years how many

883.7 --> 892.0400000000001
what's the percentage in all that time

886.74 --> 895.5600000000001
that humans had actual access to fire

892.04 --> 899.9599999999999
that they could make it because I'm

895.56 --> 905.13
pretty sure humans can't eat raw meat

899.96 --> 908.9000000000001
okay so they took two million years to

905.13 --> 914.82
evolve in order to be able to process

908.9 --> 918.99
meat then why can't we still just eat

914.82 --> 921.6
meat raw that makes a little very very

918.99 --> 924.87
little sense to me throw our logic of

921.6 --> 927.83
the gods I think your logic seems to be

924.87 --> 927.83
failing here

956.6 --> 965.85
now that's not raw that's rare

963.42 --> 969.3299999999999
that's not the same Thor logic of the

965.85 --> 973.41
gods that's not raw and besides its

969.33 --> 975.57
well-known they're more raw the meat is

973.41 --> 978.2099999999999
that you eat the more trouble your gut

975.57 --> 979.95
is gonna get processing it and it's even

978.21 --> 982.14
well known that people that liked raw

979.95 --> 986.25
meat yeah because not saying that humans

982.14 --> 989.43
can learn to like that some do well they

986.25 --> 992.58
get gut problems because it just it

989.43 --> 996.78
heaps up it doesn't digest and can cause

992.58 --> 1002.14
big problems can start rotting if these

996.78 --> 1002.14
metabolism is slow of the individual so

1009.709 --> 1018.319
but I'm sure that humans have definitely

1013.56 --> 1023.25
learned to adapt under not to long run

1018.319 --> 1029.1599999999999
to eating well processed meat as in heat

1023.25 --> 1032.16
processed meat where the that the the

1029.16 --> 1035.25
proteins have been transformed through

1032.16 --> 1039.15
the heat and by that process it turns

1035.25 --> 1041.4
into something that we can halfway

1039.15 --> 1044.25
decently digest although the actual

1041.4 --> 1049.679
digestion process is very complicated

1044.25 --> 1052.11
off of heated meat because we require a

1049.679 --> 1055.5590000000002
lot of base resources that we normally

1052.11 --> 1058.4699999999998
derive from vegetables in order to

1055.559 --> 1062.34
properly process it it's a lot of extra

1058.47 --> 1064.32
work for a metabolism to do it so yes it

1062.34 --> 1067.53
is an adaptation question

1064.32 --> 1070.1399999999999
I don't think humans are fundamentally

1067.53 --> 1075.1499999999999
meant to eat meat like the original

1070.14 --> 1078.21
blueprint but we have adapted to be able

1075.15 --> 1080.789
to do that if necessary and I pretty

1078.21 --> 1083.909
sure that adaptation is purely based on

1080.789 --> 1092.539
the necessity of periods of starvation

1083.909 --> 1095.64
we're big droughts or yeah when suddenly

1092.539 --> 1097.47
yeah giant volcano eruptions has been

1095.64 --> 1101.8400000000001
dark for a while a lot of plants die

1097.47 --> 1107.19
crops fail and suddenly only animals are

1101.84 --> 1111.75
left so we are either you die or you

1107.19 --> 1113.73
start digging for ya for roots or

1111.75 --> 1116.789
whatever you eat what's whatever's left

1113.73 --> 1120.63
or you're gonna try to eat meat to

1116.789 --> 1123.99
survive because it can work on the short

1120.63 --> 1126.3500000000001
run at least so that's what I think why

1123.99 --> 1129.299
we can eat meat it is pure an adaptation

1126.35 --> 1133.559
question you could say it's being

1129.299 --> 1138.6299999999999
allowed by creation but it's we're not

1133.559 --> 1141.48
that's not our primary function it's not

1138.63 --> 1144.38
the origin well that's how I see it so

1141.48 --> 1144.38
yeah

1153.9 --> 1159.7900000000002
this yeah Yoder Klein I've heard of that

1157.36 --> 1163.51
yeah that's that's been true Kellogg's

1159.79 --> 1166.12
did that it's pretty weird you could

1163.51 --> 1172.24
like get that [ __ ] out with magnet I've

1166.12 --> 1176.7099999999998
seen the videos it's been a wild out no

1172.24 --> 1181.74
we have not evolved as omnivores Paul we

1176.71 --> 1181.74
have not we've not evolved we adapted

1185.34 --> 1193.59
adaptation is a survival system to be

1189.61 --> 1196.09
able to maneuver in unexpected

1193.59 --> 1199.059
environmental changes and to survive

1196.09 --> 1201.04
through those periods of extreme change

1199.059 --> 1203.16
that's adaptation it's not evolution

1201.04 --> 1207.4289999999999
because we definitely do change back

1203.16 --> 1211.5900000000001
when we are allowed go back to the

1207.429 --> 1211.5900000000001
original print yes Paul

1218.24 --> 1225.82
yeah we have the possibility did you

1222.26 --> 1229.28
know that there are animals out there

1225.82 --> 1232.1
this is kind of weird I can't name

1229.28 --> 1234.62
examples off the top of my tongue at the

1232.1 --> 1239.1499999999999
top of my head but there are animals out

1234.62 --> 1243.56
there that are absolute vegetarians is

1239.15 --> 1247.72
were they they only eat vegetables but

1243.56 --> 1252.11
sometimes they do eat freaking meat so

1247.72 --> 1255.89
you don't really understand what that is

1252.11 --> 1259.6699999999998
I think that in a way almost all

1255.89 --> 1261.41
creatures or well not every creature but

1259.67 --> 1264.3500000000001
a lot of creatures even the ones that

1261.41 --> 1267.68
are not never eat meat that they are

1264.35 --> 1270.98
still able to at some times because it

1267.68 --> 1275.0
just has there's another deeper design

1270.98 --> 1278.0
function there but it's just not

1275.0 --> 1283.4
something that most creatures do on a

1278.0 --> 1289.19
regular basis right and so the teeth the

1283.4 --> 1291.8300000000002
teeth are there and they help but yeah

1289.19 --> 1294.94
there's been look there's quite a few

1291.83 --> 1298.34
sets of teeth out there that are very

1294.94 --> 1303.29
just differently at half that you could

1298.34 --> 1307.85
say so to attribute these teeth to this

1303.29 --> 1310.7
is how it's always meant to be I don't

1307.85 --> 1313.01
know I guess you could say in the blue a

1310.7 --> 1316.3400000000001
Bob that's what I say in the blueprint

1313.01 --> 1320.0
of our original design it's always it

1316.34 --> 1324.74
was always designated as an option it's

1320.0 --> 1326.69
just giving us flexibility and by that

1324.74 --> 1329.84
standard I can conclude that it was

1326.69 --> 1332.21
never really forbidden but it's not a

1329.84 --> 1335.99
primary thing or our instincts would be

1332.21 --> 1340.43
much better adapt to do it to that

1335.99 --> 1344.71
specifically and we would be able to eat

1340.43 --> 1344.71
raw meat and we can't

1345.92 --> 1354.45
so yeah if you come to three keep on

1350.58 --> 1356.52
angling the situation through evolution

1354.45 --> 1365.15
you're just gonna make it very hard on

1356.52 --> 1368.69
yourself that's nonsense

1365.15 --> 1371.1000000000001
nobody is gonna die from nutrition

1368.69 --> 1372.78
malnutrition when they stop eating meat

1371.1 --> 1375.7099999999998
the Thoreau logic of the gods that's

1372.78 --> 1375.71
absolutely [ __ ]

1376.49 --> 1384.23
there's many vegetarians out there some

1380.22 --> 1390.23
that have been vegetarians for decades

1384.23 --> 1393.69
it's ridiculous you must can definitely

1390.23 --> 1395.8700000000001
survive without eating meat absolutely

1393.69 --> 1395.8700000000001
they can

1401.49 --> 1404.609
[Music]

1421.96 --> 1434.44
so if you only eat meat well only yeah I

1430.6 --> 1437.35
don't know it also depends on the only

1434.44 --> 1443.1390000000001
individual though yes sir I did kind of

1437.35 --> 1447.869
miss misread it but there are people out

1443.139 --> 1447.869
there that do thrive on me

1451.48 --> 1459.179
it because it has to do also with the

1454.09 --> 1464.62
blood type so there are just individuals

1459.179 --> 1467.3200000000002
from certain the original stems from

1464.62 --> 1470.83
original races you could say and it's

1467.32 --> 1473.11
not Universal but that can just they get

1470.83 --> 1476.4399999999998
a crush on me their metabolism is just

1473.11 --> 1478.12
great for it they rarely they rarely

1476.44 --> 1482.3200000000002
have problems with me

1478.12 --> 1485.3799999999999
they can even almost digest rare meat

1482.32 --> 1488.559
and all that and others can't others

1485.38 --> 1491.529
really need it very well-done like I'm

1488.559 --> 1493.389
one of those people then when I eat meat

1491.529 --> 1497.679
it has to be well done and it's

1493.389 --> 1500.32
instinctual like I I always like even my

1497.679 --> 1503.3200000000002
dad my dad was the cook mostly in the

1500.32 --> 1506.529
kitchen in the family and back in the

1503.32 --> 1509.62
day always like no I wanted well done I

1506.529 --> 1514.899
don't want to see any red spots left or

1509.62 --> 1518.0189999999998
anything because I know that if it's me

1514.899 --> 1520.0
just if I bite on meat and I feel it's

1518.019 --> 1521.919
not perfectly right I don't feel the

1520.0 --> 1524.83
fibers being in the structure that I

1521.919 --> 1526.72
need it to be then I'll just get in my

1524.83 --> 1530.889
instinct to tell me like no it's not

1526.72 --> 1533.2
good but there's other people out there

1530.889 --> 1534.85
that that don't have that kind of

1533.2 --> 1539.98
response and that thrive on it

1534.85 --> 1542.3799999999999
that can digest it a lot better so it's

1539.98 --> 1545.46
different the metabolism is different

1542.38 --> 1545.46
for each individual

1549.25 --> 1566.15
that's ridiculous Paul it's absolutely

1556.04 --> 1571.21
ridiculous evolved as animals foraging

1566.15 --> 1571.21
for nuts and berries it's just

1574.55 --> 1581.23
I can believe it that you would stick to

1577.82 --> 1581.23
that so dumb

1598.28 --> 1605.54
like animals it's just not true like

1603.2 --> 1608.3300000000002
even if you would imagine that one

1605.54 --> 1610.7
species could mutate into another right

1608.33 --> 1615.5
which is the ridiculous base Framus for

1610.7 --> 1619.81
evolution hello humans can't eat raw

1615.5 --> 1622.22
meat how is an animal right still

1619.81 --> 1626.06
considerable an animal that's what you

1622.22 --> 1629.03
said how is it going to end guard on

1626.06 --> 1632.84
meat without mastering fire and cooking

1629.03 --> 1637.97
and super complicated tasks that humans

1632.84 --> 1650.06
naturally do in order to evolve using

1637.97 --> 1652.76
them it makes no sense you seem to be

1650.06 --> 1655.3899999999999
overlooking the baseline fact that we

1652.76 --> 1655.39
all know

1663.59 --> 1671.509
how can how can humans supposedly evolve

1667.399 --> 1674.629
from an animal state to the human the

1671.509 --> 1678.2
modernized humans that we are based on

1674.629 --> 1682.629
eating raw meats when we cannot eat raw

1678.2 --> 1682.6290000000001
meat makes no sense

1689.78 --> 1698.84
how can we evolve from a substance that

1693.83 --> 1701.48
we cannot digest it makes no sense yeah

1698.84 --> 1703.9399999999998
Cleary well he says we were animals so

1701.48 --> 1706.6100000000001
if we were foraging for nuts and berries

1703.94 --> 1709.8400000000001
and sometimes Gorge ourselves of meat

1706.61 --> 1713.83
what gorge ourselves on raw meat really

1709.84 --> 1716.84
like raw fish okay I could go with that

1713.83 --> 1720.23
that probably had a big part in the

1716.84 --> 1724.1899999999998
thriving of of certain tribes that were

1720.23 --> 1728.81
close by rivers and all that but raw

1724.19 --> 1731.1200000000001
meat humans can't digest that so unless

1728.81 --> 1733.85
they already mastered fire which would

1731.12 --> 1739.28
make them well beyond what is considered

1733.85 --> 1742.6999999999998
the animal state of being then how could

1739.28 --> 1745.31
how could humans in the animal state of

1742.7 --> 1747.95
being have evolved themselves from

1745.31 --> 1749.72
eating raw meat when they can't eat raw

1747.95 --> 1753.6100000000001
meat when they can't digest it it makes

1749.72 --> 1753.6100000000001
no damn sense so ludicrous

1766.92 --> 1770.49
right the other Mikan yet the champion

1769.38 --> 1773.22
see that's a good one

1770.49 --> 1775.41
yeah chimpanzees can actually eat raw

1773.22 --> 1779.81
meat it that it was one of the examples

1775.41 --> 1784.17
I wanted to give earlier but I couldn't

1779.81 --> 1787.53
point at the exact animal but yeah they

1784.17 --> 1789.27
do I guess what we're not chimpanzees

1787.53 --> 1793.29
hey you can think of yourself as a

1789.27 --> 1795.93
chimpanzee if you want to Paul it's one

1793.29 --> 1798.8999999999999
of the advantages of being a believer in

1795.93 --> 1802.43
evolution you can think of yourself as a

1798.9 --> 1802.43
chimp okay

1811.69 --> 1819.89
[Music]

1828.419 --> 1834.46
right well hey Paul you're not that

1832.029 --> 1837.7
genetically far removed from an

1834.46 --> 1840.789
earthworm either you know think about

1837.7 --> 1843.94
that one no now your baseline

1840.789 --> 1848.32
understandings of genetics is highly in

1843.94 --> 1850.72
fear it is very 90s because since the

1848.32 --> 1852.9399999999998
90s the genome project has happened

1850.72 --> 1854.919
pretty much pretty elaborately and then

1852.94 --> 1857.47
they concluded that their original

1854.919 --> 1860.23
assertions about genetics were wrong

1857.47 --> 1862.99
that in fact there's an old other factor

1860.23 --> 1865.8700000000001
at play that completely resets the

1862.99 --> 1870.309
entire premise called epigenetics

1865.87 --> 1875.2299999999998
it's switches on top of the protein

1870.309 --> 1877.299
genetic structure that can actually be

1875.23 --> 1879.49
considered the foundation of adaptation

1877.299 --> 1882.789
because it responds very quickly over

1879.49 --> 1887.14
generations and often due to electric

1882.789 --> 1889.179
magnetic and chemical especially

1887.14 --> 1892.929
poisonous influences from the outside

1889.179 --> 1898.029
and causes pretty abrupt change in the

1892.929 --> 1903.49
way genetics will rearrange the the

1898.029 --> 1907.45
basic print for the next generation and

1903.49 --> 1909.789
it's called adaptation yeah that came

1907.45 --> 1911.95
out of the genome project the genome

1909.789 --> 1916.96
project that desperate desperate attempt

1911.95 --> 1919.419
to try and prove evolution with building

1916.96 --> 1920.77
blocks with trying to find the building

1919.419 --> 1923.0200000000002
blocks well guess what those building

1920.77 --> 1925.48
blocks were not what everybody thought

1923.02 --> 1929.26
they were turned out to be much more

1925.48 --> 1931.24
complex and the extrapolated results

1929.26 --> 1937.36
from that based on epigenetics revealed

1931.24 --> 1941.74
a whole new development in how it really

1937.36 --> 1945.1299999999999
works and that's called epigenetics and

1941.74 --> 1949.169
it it kinda really does disprove

1945.13 --> 1949.169
evolution so

1953.62 --> 1960.76
yeah yeah the whole Human Genome Project

1957.7 --> 1963.5900000000001
right shows that there are incredible

1960.76 --> 1966.679
genetic correlations but guess what

1963.59 --> 1968.59
genetic percentage correlation it

1966.679 --> 1973.19
doesn't really matter

1968.59 --> 1975.559
anything anything because what I just

1973.19 --> 1979.159
told you and you keep on ignoring it

1975.559 --> 1981.6789999999999
okay good good little baller ignoring

1979.159 --> 1984.1100000000001
the the contradicting data the data that

1981.679 --> 1987.25
contradicts your beliefs cuz you're

1984.11 --> 1989.27
religious fanatic obviously both right

1987.25 --> 1994.22
so yeah

1989.27 --> 1997.97
the genome project revealed that genetic

1994.22 --> 2004.21
correlation is completely negligible it

1997.97 --> 2006.6100000000001
is not significant for anything it

2004.21 --> 2010.0
doesn't matter how much genetics

2006.61 --> 2014.1999999999998
correlate just tells you like what is

2010.0 --> 2017.74
the the protein yeah base building

2014.2 --> 2019.45
blocks of which is it is comprised like

2017.74 --> 2022.33
which Lego blocks are going to be used

2019.45 --> 2026.0800000000002
to build this but it doesn't actually

2022.33 --> 2030.87
reveal anything as to the origin

2026.08 --> 2033.8799999999999
evolution wise it just revealed that

2030.87 --> 2040.6
epigenetics exists and that the these

2033.88 --> 2043.5100000000002
epigenetic effects show that there can

2040.6 --> 2045.6399999999999
be quick evolution which cannot be

2043.51 --> 2048.429
considered the original concept of

2045.64 --> 2051.659
evolution its adaptation evolution is

2048.429 --> 2053.919
not a quick generational change no or

2051.659 --> 2055.7200000000003
adaptation is a quick generational

2053.919 --> 2060.339
change and evolution originally was

2055.72 --> 2062.6789999999996
conceptualized as a very slow trial and

2060.339 --> 2066.429
error based system where basically

2062.679 --> 2071.2000000000003
certain types of mutation features would

2066.429 --> 2074.02
survive and then start forming new

2071.2 --> 2077.3689999999997
that's just not what the genome project

2074.02 --> 2077.369
reveals buddy

2095.82 --> 2100.4700000000003
no no you don't and get the hell out of

2098.37 --> 2104.7
here because you are a spamming

2100.47 --> 2109.91
religious fanatic liar and you can take

2104.7 --> 2109.91
your lies and gush it out somewhere else

2115.52 --> 2122.64
everything I said is all based on recent

2120.24 --> 2127.7999999999997
history the actual developments I kept

2122.64 --> 2130.35
track I was open to it as in sure

2127.8 --> 2133.4700000000003
evolution I kind of liked the idea I'd

2130.35 --> 2135.48
never really made it creation to be

2133.47 --> 2137.37
there in the first place I just noticed

2135.48 --> 2140.64
that there seems to be a lot of viable

2137.37 --> 2142.41
proof for it when it was still kind of

2140.64 --> 2144.9
neutral about it and then I learned

2142.41 --> 2146.04
about the genome project and epigenetics

2144.9 --> 2149.7000000000003
that came out of it

2146.04 --> 2153.21
yeah you like to ignore it ignore it

2149.7 --> 2156.99
Apple ignore it and keep on washing your

2153.21 --> 2160.08
same [ __ ] freakin genetic correlations

2156.99 --> 2163.41
like that proves anything even though I

2160.08 --> 2165.06
just told you why it didn't and yeah if

2163.41 --> 2166.89
you then proceeded to just keep on

2165.06 --> 2169.59
ignoring it and spamming your [ __ ]

2166.89 --> 2174.2999999999997
getting gradually more disgusting as you

2169.59 --> 2176.58
do that's when you get banned so yeah

2174.3 --> 2179.34
you try again with another sock account

2176.58 --> 2182.1
and this time learn from your mistakes

2179.34 --> 2184.92
adapt not expecting you to evolve

2182.1 --> 2188.6
because evolution is [ __ ] but I know

2184.92 --> 2188.6
humans can definitely adapt

2196.94 --> 2200.68
[Music]

2198.13 --> 2202.239
okay you want my explanation for that

2200.68 --> 2205.8089999999997
it's very simple

2202.239 --> 2208.089
the original markers your primate oh

2205.809 --> 2208.8390000000004
it's the same Margaret is yeah well

2208.089 --> 2213.759
guess what

2208.839 --> 2217.15
it's all based on the designs that were

2213.759 --> 2219.729
originally devised within creation for

2217.15 --> 2223.089
life by the creators the Creator the

2219.729 --> 2225.6699999999996
creators the designer the design right

2223.089 --> 2229.66
yeah I guess what that design was kind

2225.67 --> 2234.2490000000003
of based on the same system because it

2229.66 --> 2236.44
was designed to be an ecosystem where

2234.249 --> 2238.93
everything could in some way be

2236.44 --> 2243.19
compatible with other things be able to

2238.93 --> 2247.989
process it be able to take those types

2243.19 --> 2250.539
of building blocks and then thrive that

2247.989 --> 2252.91
is what life in this realm has been

2250.539 --> 2255.3390000000004
designed for so yeah who's gonna be

2252.91 --> 2259.0589999999997
surprised that the designer for it all

2255.339 --> 2261.009
used the same base building blocks for

2259.059 --> 2267.239
the design because the more the same it

2261.009 --> 2272.319
is yeah the less problems you have the

2267.239 --> 2274.69
less toxic one species becomes in front

2272.319 --> 2278.65
in the face of another directly or

2274.69 --> 2282.64
indirectly that is what the design was

2278.65 --> 2286.2690000000002
oriented around about metabolics that is

2282.64 --> 2288.94
all basically all can be part of one

2286.269 --> 2291.5789999999997
another because it's all built with the

2288.94 --> 2293.71
same original building blocks so yeah oh

2291.579 --> 2296.079
you can find markers can you oh it's

2293.71 --> 2299.079
just the same well guess what it was

2296.079 --> 2301.739
made by the same designer use the same

2299.079 --> 2301.739
building blocks

2309.86 --> 2312.9790000000003
[Music]

2317.3 --> 2326.84
yeah no that's fine Thor you just go and

2320.45 --> 2328.73
hand wave dismiss but yeah your gods are

2326.84 --> 2332.6600000000003
not very freakin logical they're

2328.73 --> 2335.21
actually kind of [ __ ] now I don't

2332.66 --> 2339.17
know you're actually an embarrassment to

2335.21 --> 2343.91
your pantheon Thor like even the

2339.17 --> 2347.59
Pantheon knows better than all this

2343.91 --> 2347.5899999999997
atheist nonsense

2347.8 --> 2350.9990000000003
[Music]

2363.88 --> 2368.76
yeah that's right Adam ikan Adam gets it

2369.15 --> 2373.89
no I'm not gonna freakin debate Baldy

2372.85 --> 2379.62
GATS

2373.89 --> 2382.66
especially on evolution I everything I

2379.62 --> 2387.16
want to say about it I'll say it here on

2382.66 --> 2390.2799999999997
my show I have that's it there is no

2387.16 --> 2393.1499999999996
debate I don't want to freakin debate

2390.28 --> 2396.4500000000003
I'm not a biologist I just happen to be

2393.15 --> 2399.4900000000002
interested in this because I got into

2396.45 --> 2402.0299999999997
creation versus evolution way before I

2399.49 --> 2404.9399999999996
did flatter it like more into it

2402.03 --> 2408.67
then I could with Flat Earth earlier on

2404.94 --> 2412.18
and I've seen a lot it's very very

2408.67 --> 2414.4
interested but there is no debate there

2412.18 --> 2417.3399999999997
are the arguments and then there is be

2414.4 --> 2420.48
[ __ ] atheists that refuse to listen

2417.34 --> 2423.04
and straw man just like with the ball

2420.48 --> 2428.23
because they're religious fanatics and

2423.04 --> 2431.56
they are [ __ ] and I'm not gonna

2428.23 --> 2434.89
debate that I've got better ways to

2431.56 --> 2437.04
waste my time give you the arguments

2434.89 --> 2437.04
though

2452.05 --> 2460.6600000000003
what scientific evidence that ballers

2456.34 --> 2466.3900000000003
and atheists are [ __ ] well just look

2460.66 --> 2470.35
in the chat just look at the sheer

2466.39 --> 2472.6
amount of default straw men and red

2470.35 --> 2474.93
herrings that ballers and atheists

2472.6 --> 2477.85
forward whenever an argument is made

2474.93 --> 2480.0099999999998
they don't counter the argument no they

2477.85 --> 2483.13
straumann it they red-herring it to

2480.01 --> 2487.1200000000003
another subject they avoid it because

2483.13 --> 2491.5
you're wrong and you're too proud and

2487.12 --> 2496.06
dumb and scared and lame to admit it to

2491.5 --> 2500.14
yourself so you let the devil take over

2496.06 --> 2504.2799999999997
you let the devil blind you inside so

2500.14 --> 2508.87
you use devious tactics the swirl around

2504.28 --> 2511.3300000000004
the hot iron with truth and you prevent

2508.87 --> 2514.8599999999997
it from seething your consciousness you

2511.33 --> 2514.86
let that devil do it for you

2523.37 --> 2527.29
yeah the Meakin I know I know

2549.97 --> 2556.089
no no not straw Manning anyone just

2552.369 --> 2558.06
pointing at the facts and ready to get

2556.089 --> 2562.42
banned because there's gonna be a few

2558.06 --> 2565.3289999999997
triggered idiots in there and they are

2562.42 --> 2569.26
just gonna spiral but I don't mind

2565.329 --> 2572.5
because I don't really like idiots in my

2569.26 --> 2574.75
chat whether they are dormant or whether

2572.5 --> 2576.55
they are gushing and trolling I don't

2574.75 --> 2578.74
really want them in here not even

2576.55 --> 2582.9100000000003
dormant so I this is how I weed them out

2578.74 --> 2586.2099999999996
I trigger them I shove the the truth

2582.91 --> 2590.47
right in their faces very up close very

2586.21 --> 2593.8
unobstructed very directly so they must

2590.47 --> 2599.14
be triggered they cannot step away now

2593.8 --> 2602.53
without revealing the seed the seed of

2599.14 --> 2605.95
evil within them the little devil they

2602.53 --> 2609.19
slit they they went with they became

2605.95 --> 2611.47
buddies with that with that system that

2609.19 --> 2616.77
lies for them in order for them to keep

2611.47 --> 2616.77
believing the dream that they believe in

2617.01 --> 2626.4700000000003
so yeah I make it bloom for everybody to

2621.88 --> 2631.4500000000003
see and then when I think enough of it

2626.47 --> 2633.79
has been seen then I banned them because

2631.45 --> 2637.5
you have no control over your faculties

2633.79 --> 2640.27
you have no conceived that control up

2637.5 --> 2645.839
when you went with the lie you gave it

2640.27 --> 2649.63
up to the devil and you can rationalize

2645.839 --> 2652.29
evade whatever you like still what it is

2649.63 --> 2655.78
in the essence of it in your spirit

2652.29 --> 2658.63
nobody can maybe tell you that and

2655.78 --> 2660.13
you're giving a good response to it it

2658.63 --> 2665.609
doesn't mean that it's not blatantly

2660.13 --> 2665.609
obvious to everyone but you

2672.55 --> 2677.23
adèle voice a spirit John our Tao you

2675.559 --> 2684.1400000000003
could also call him Irie man

2677.23 --> 2688.25
Ironman the spirit of death the end so

2684.14 --> 2691.97
yeah you could say esoteric but you know

2688.25 --> 2696.95
I kind of wanted to to just say the word

2691.97 --> 2701.569
devil because they hate it so much they

2696.95 --> 2708.04
hate the exoteric side of Christianity

2701.569 --> 2710.99
so bad so bad it brings out the

2708.04 --> 2714.2599999999998
Antichrist within them every time you do

2710.99 --> 2716.93
that because then they'll think you're

2714.26 --> 2719.2400000000002
the religion person you're talking about

2716.93 --> 2721.73
the devil you're the religious person

2719.24 --> 2724.79
even though they overlook that when I

2721.73 --> 2728.809
use that word it has an esoteric meaning

2724.79 --> 2731.329
I'm actually pointing at a psychological

2728.809 --> 2734.1800000000003
structure framework that is transpiring

2731.329 --> 2736.7000000000003
within them in this very moment as they

2734.18 --> 2739.22
watch as they type their comments and

2736.7 --> 2745.069
listen to what I say it's happening

2739.22 --> 2748.609
right now but they can't see it because

2745.069 --> 2753.29
i used the word devil and that's an

2748.609 --> 2757.0099999999998
exoteric word and they hate it so bad it

2753.29 --> 2759.68
is one of the first things the exoteric

2757.01 --> 2765.44
side of christianity is has what has

2759.68 --> 2768.5589999999997
been utilized to get a lot of people to

2765.44 --> 2772.609
become atheists including myself when I

2768.559 --> 2776.03
was young so I know I know what I'm

2772.609 --> 2777.8289999999997
talking about because I was there got

2776.03 --> 2781.7200000000003
over it though but I know there's still

2777.829 --> 2784.1600000000003
a lot of people out there in heaven and

2781.72 --> 2787.3289999999997
they're spamming their nonsense in my

2784.16 --> 2787.3289999999997
chat right now

2792.34 --> 2804.19
until they get banned so every time I

2801.58 --> 2808.23
talk about the devil well that they

2804.19 --> 2811.6
don't get it they can't even think

2808.23 --> 2816.22
esoterically they don't even know what

2811.6 --> 2820.0899999999997
esoteric means to them esoteric is like

2816.22 --> 2822.8799999999997
a defiance of the physical baseline that

2820.09 --> 2825.34
is the foundation of all logic and

2822.88 --> 2828.6400000000003
reality from the Atheist perspective so

2825.34 --> 2831.88
they can't even look they can't even see

2828.64 --> 2836.5899999999997
esoterics every time I describe anything

2831.88 --> 2840.34
esoteric they cannot even see what I'm

2836.59 --> 2842.86
trying to say they cannot they stare on

2840.34 --> 2845.02
it maybe if they record it write it down

2842.86 --> 2846.73
and then cross-reference it and then

2845.02 --> 2848.44
they might halfway get what I'm actually

2846.73 --> 2850.39
talking about they're never going to do

2848.44 --> 2854.55
that they're just gonna fixate on that

2850.39 --> 2857.97
exoteric meaning that they hate so much

2854.55 --> 2857.9700000000003
what I say

2861.75 --> 2870.22
no need

2863.049 --> 2873.0
SOT exoteric and esoteric with an e both

2870.22 --> 2873.0
with ease

2873.26 --> 2879.0200000000004
[Music]

2887.72 --> 2892.9089999999997
[Music]

2899.589 --> 2906.249
now I get it it's a really dumb joke

2902.559 --> 2908.559
Chris Barker you know when when people

2906.249 --> 2913.7189999999996
say things that are just really dumb and

2908.559 --> 2916.7690000000002
bass basic my first response is that I

2913.719 --> 2919.18
literally rub it out of my memory

2916.769 --> 2924.749
because I actually find really dumb

2919.18 --> 2924.749
jokes just insulting it's just insulting

2937.95 --> 2943.54
why would I answer your question about

2940.48 --> 2945.93
ring species why don't you address my

2943.54 --> 2948.34
arguments that have been talking about

2945.93 --> 2950.83
concerning adaptation and against

2948.34 --> 2953.53
evolution in the last half-hour why

2950.83 --> 2956.23
don't you talk about that I'd like to

2953.53 --> 2960.3700000000003
hear some feedback from evolution

2956.23 --> 2962.8
believers that they actually even have

2960.37 --> 2965.7999999999997
heard my arguments that they can

2962.8 --> 2967.3300000000004
feedback what my arguments technically

2965.8 --> 2970.96
are because I never actually hear that

2967.33 --> 2972.19
from people I just the same evasive [ __ ]

2970.96 --> 2975.04
all over and that is what I've been

2972.19 --> 2980.23
rambling on about but it just it's

2975.04 --> 2982.69
proven because I never get feedback from

2980.23 --> 2984.79
the other side that wants to debate me

2982.69 --> 2986.61
that they even understand what the hell

2984.79 --> 2989.68
I'm talking about

2986.61 --> 2994.1200000000003
because they don't they believe in

2989.68 --> 2996.5499999999997
evolution and they've looked at data

2994.12 --> 2999.79
that they didn't understand and heard

2996.55 --> 3001.65
stories from people that claims to know

2999.79 --> 3003.93
what they were talking about telling

3001.65 --> 3006.36
them that it is true for evolution but

3003.93 --> 3012.5299999999997
they're all too freakin dumb to get any

3006.36 --> 3015.21
of it because they're gullible

3012.53 --> 3017.73
they don't actually look into the

3015.21 --> 3020.46
technical backdrop structures of the

3017.73 --> 3023.91
entire reasoning behind it just makes no

3020.46 --> 3028.61
sense with evolution an adaptation it

3023.91 --> 3035.22
came out of an actual empirical research

3028.61 --> 3038.46
hello adaptation right that's not like a

3035.22 --> 3044.1
hundred year old theory no it came out

3038.46 --> 3048.65
of epigenetics which came out of the

3044.1 --> 3051.33
genome project hello it's your

3048.65 --> 3052.89
scientific research project right that

3051.33 --> 3056.34
was supposed to be there to prove

3052.89 --> 3058.02
evolution what proved adaptation no

3056.34 --> 3060.3
you're gonna have to get over it just

3058.02 --> 3062.7
like you're gonna have to get over the

3060.3 --> 3065.52
geometrical curve not being a thing

3062.7 --> 3066.8199999999997
anymore right it's not the horizon

3065.52 --> 3070.39
you're gonna get out

3066.82 --> 3074.7400000000002
get over that - I know it's very tough

3070.39 --> 3078.39
very tough when your nonsense is getting

3074.74 --> 3078.39
revealed to the world to be lies

3088.75 --> 3097.99
Wow well I don't need science to tell me

3095.42 --> 3102.8
how to think thank you very much

3097.99 --> 3104.33
everything that I've been taught through

3102.8 --> 3107.3900000000003
science in schools

3104.33 --> 3109.24
yeah I'd literally just narrow down the

3107.39 --> 3112.49
mind even further it just turned

3109.24 --> 3114.1699999999996
intellectualism into a new religion okay

3112.49 --> 3118.58
I don't need freakin scientists that

3114.17 --> 3123.5
tell me how to think I'll use my own

3118.58 --> 3127.58
damn faculties nobody needs to tell me

3123.5 --> 3130.82
how to think and nobody tells me what to

3127.58 --> 3134.65
think either they can tell me what they

3130.82 --> 3134.65
think and then I'll make up my own mind

3144.03 --> 3150.76
[Music]

3161.56 --> 3166.7799999999997
very real result the real result of what

3164.38 --> 3170.62
an experiment that actually proves a

3166.78 --> 3171.7200000000003
viable hypothesis so can you show it to

3170.62 --> 3175.48
me

3171.72 --> 3178.7099999999996
can you show the viable hypothesis based

3175.48 --> 3181.39
science that prove your assertions

3178.71 --> 3183.82
because I know you love to brag about

3181.39 --> 3185.7999999999997
this general [ __ ] that you read

3183.82 --> 3188.65
somewhere in some random news article

3185.8 --> 3191.29
that you didn't even source I'll bet

3188.65 --> 3193.84
money on that that you didn't even

3191.29 --> 3197.37
source that because people that talk

3193.84 --> 3197.3700000000003
like you don't they never do

3236.21 --> 3241.7
just don't do that again please yell

3239.25 --> 3241.7
airplane

3253.67 --> 3259.609
yeah expert science expert it's lovely

3257.569 --> 3261.829
when somebody calls themselves an expert

3259.609 --> 3265.279
because the general public then

3261.829 --> 3268.01
immediately lost trusts on them it's a

3265.279 --> 3270.079
sad state of affairs that is

3268.01 --> 3271.8190000000004
unfortunately tied in with the general

3270.079 --> 3276.619
state of mind of human beings in this

3271.819 --> 3281.779
age just like the lab code effect yeah

3276.619 --> 3284.2690000000002
oh wow well Chris Parker well if the

3281.779 --> 3288.079
Vatican has accepted evolution you know

3284.269 --> 3290.1499999999996
the devil himself the church as what

3288.079 --> 3293.96
Christ kind of like opposed and all that

3290.15 --> 3296.44
well if they say it's true and a they

3293.96 --> 3298.819
invented the Big Bang as well you know

3296.44 --> 3300.98
well if they say it's true then it's

3298.819 --> 3304.279
okay because they are the Christian and

3300.98 --> 3307.01
I'm the Christian according to you yet

3304.279 --> 3309.019
yeah you're all going with exoteric sand

3307.01 --> 3312.559
you have no idea what the hell you're

3309.019 --> 3314.2099999999996
talking about literally you don't even

3312.559 --> 3317.5690000000004
know what that means if the Catholic

3314.21 --> 3320.599
Church is for something you just don't

3317.569 --> 3323.349
know what the hell is going on because

3320.599 --> 3323.349
you haven't paid attention

3353.24 --> 3356.08
hmm

3358.44 --> 3364.89
I wouldn't go as far as that good

3360.599 --> 3370.67
servant but he is certainly defying the

3364.89 --> 3370.67
will of Christ you could say you know

3377.85 --> 3383.0099999999998
so yeah again the devil you know are you

3381.09 --> 3386.1200000000003
saying that in an exoteric or an

3383.01 --> 3389.34
esoteric way in an esoteric way oh yeah

3386.12 --> 3393.75
that's kind of the whole point the

3389.34 --> 3395.15
Catholic Church and the Vatican it's

3393.75 --> 3398.79
what they do

3395.15 --> 3402.0
exoteric Lina you know a devil character

3398.79 --> 3404.7799999999997
a separate conscious or like a separate

3402.0 --> 3404.78
entity in there

3418.2 --> 3423.1499999999996
this is getting really tiresome Chris

3420.27 --> 3424.55
Parker I basically did the entire hang

3423.15 --> 3428.82
out about it gave several examples

3424.55 --> 3432.0
several times why would do we need to

3428.82 --> 3437.88
look at these damn ring species what is

3432.0 --> 3440.85
some microorganism in why does that mean

3437.88 --> 3446.09
anything to the grand scale of supposed

3440.85 --> 3449.4
creation it doesn't mean anything okay

3446.09 --> 3453.4500000000003
there's even conflicts as to for example

3449.4 --> 3456.4500000000003
what bacteria fundamentally even are so

3453.45 --> 3459.48
kind of weird wild allopathic theories

3456.45 --> 3463.08
that basically resulted into the medical

3459.48 --> 3465.05
industrial complex we know but even

3463.08 --> 3467.97
bacteria themselves are misunderstood

3465.05 --> 3470.4
and they're assumed to be like a

3467.97 --> 3475.43
separate organism entirely I don't even

3470.4 --> 3475.4300000000003
think they are that really so

3486.65 --> 3492.92
oh really Thor let you give two goats oh

3490.21 --> 3496.569
what he exists that cried outside of the

3492.92 --> 3499.64
Bible well why don't you look into the

3496.569 --> 3503.769
into some of the ancient works from the

3499.64 --> 3507.95
Hindus you know did you know that Christ

3503.769 --> 3511.749
actually went to India there's a temple

3507.95 --> 3511.749
there mm-hmm

3512.92 --> 3519.2200000000003
didn't look very why did you it's so

3517.279 --> 3524.93
dumb

3519.22 --> 3526.66
atheists are so dumb and they think

3524.93 --> 3529.819
they're the smartest people in the world

3526.66 --> 3532.39
because they've been told that if you

3529.819 --> 3535.7889999999998
believe that [ __ ] that you're smaller

3532.39 --> 3537.769
that you're smart they start doing it

3535.789 --> 3541.1800000000003
throughout the 70s through media by

3537.769 --> 3545.029
putting out all these snobs glass

3541.18 --> 3546.9199999999996
well-spoken people they'll be like of

3545.029 --> 3550.819
course people that believe in religion

3546.92 --> 3552.98
or really dumb and you know science has

3550.819 --> 3554.72
evolved so much before that and we have

3552.98 --> 3556.7
these alternative theories now that

3554.72 --> 3559.43
sound very nice and we can see it very

3556.7 --> 3562.249
eloquently and if we just keep on saying

3559.43 --> 3564.859
this for several decades on the TV then

3562.249 --> 3566.4199999999996
new young people will be inspired by

3564.859 --> 3569.3289999999997
your performances they'll want to be

3566.42 --> 3571.7000000000003
like us and they'll try to be come like

3569.329 --> 3573.4990000000003
us now eventually when the internet

3571.7 --> 3576.049
arrives they'll start to do that [ __ ] on

3573.499 --> 3578.5989999999997
their own YouTube channels and feel like

3576.049 --> 3580.4
they were the same smart people that

3578.599 --> 3584.079
fooled them into believing all this

3580.4 --> 3586.339
nonsense and that's how the belief

3584.079 --> 3591.289
evolution and atheism is gonna

3586.339 --> 3594.3089999999997
perpetuate but yeah it kind of that

3591.289 --> 3597.98
effect that mechanism the little mini

3594.309 --> 3600.65
subculture created it prevents the

3597.98 --> 3602.989
people that deal with in from actually

3600.65 --> 3606.65
thinking critically no it's a

3602.989 --> 3608.39
storytelling tradition that's really

3606.65 --> 3611.9
that's really what that is that's what

3608.39 --> 3613.8689999999997
it is culturally functionally and that's

3611.9 --> 3616.19
how they did it

3613.869 --> 3618.4100000000003
snobs are the intellects on television

3616.19 --> 3618.789
of the devices the supposed intellect

3618.41 --> 3624.759
the

3618.789 --> 3627.309
experts in a way they convinced a lot of

3624.759 --> 3629.319
people that they would be smart if they

3627.309 --> 3631.3900000000003
believe the nonsense that they would be

3629.319 --> 3634.329
spouting and hey at the time there were

3631.39 --> 3636.64
still a lot of religious people still

3634.329 --> 3638.529
Christians still kind of based original

3636.64 --> 3643.6299999999997
Christians it would be like these people

3638.529 --> 3645.249
are all arrogant idiots and people were

3643.63 --> 3646.779
like what why are you being so mean you

3645.249 --> 3649.9889999999996
know that's just an interesting story

3646.779 --> 3653.169
that's how I responded originally but

3649.989 --> 3656.589
guess what these religious people were

3653.169 --> 3660.189
right about them they just could have

3656.589 --> 3663.549
said it in a more effective way that

3660.189 --> 3665.319
Outsiders that are not really in full

3663.549 --> 3666.759
understanding of Christ and creation and

3665.319 --> 3670.209
all that that really ties in to the

3666.759 --> 3674.049
original religion into the concept of

3670.209 --> 3680.069
Christianity as a folk thing not as the

3674.049 --> 3683.2889999999998
monumental annona monumental monumental

3680.069 --> 3688.119
monumental religious Institute not that

3683.289 --> 3691.5690000000004
but just the folk religion to be a

3688.119 --> 3693.579
Christian as it were it's kind of hard

3691.569 --> 3696.759
for a lot of it has been hard for a lot

3693.579 --> 3698.9790000000003
of people to properly translate complex

3696.759 --> 3702.219
intricate issues about their religion

3698.979 --> 3703.979
for most people to understand so

3702.219 --> 3708.849
therefore a lot of Christians became

3703.979 --> 3712.8089999999997
misunderstood as as this media attempt

3708.849 --> 3714.6400000000003
from atheists to rub off atheist culture

3712.809 --> 3716.1690000000003
in the world when that was engaged all

3714.64 --> 3717.429
these Christians that responded and

3716.169 --> 3720.519
started warning everyone they were

3717.429 --> 3723.64
misunderstood but he said secular

3720.519 --> 3726.5789999999997
populist population and that's how it

3723.64 --> 3728.65
kind of sneaked in there and and

3726.579 --> 3730.9
religion was then just like oh these are

3728.65 --> 3734.109
just all meanies and they just don't

3730.9 --> 3736.9
like listening to a good story that's

3734.109 --> 3739.959
how it sneaked in there and it is been

3736.9 --> 3743.429
in has been in there in the media now

3739.959 --> 3746.169
for for half a century

3743.429 --> 3749.57
so anyway I'm gonna round out the show I

3746.169 --> 3753.8599999999997
think oh wait not Saturday

3749.57 --> 3753.86
let me hang around a little longer

3762.63 --> 3765.23
ha

3765.79 --> 3775.57
Wow a buddy

3770.83 --> 3778.36
Thor before I ban you okay you do

3775.57 --> 3783.79
realize that your name is derived from a

3778.36 --> 3788.25
religion right so you're basically

3783.79 --> 3792.37
marking yourself with a primitive people

3788.25 --> 3796.24
thought pattern as your as your identity

3792.37 --> 3800.38
and then telling me and religion is for

3796.24 --> 3803.31
primitive people your dumb ass and I'm

3800.38 --> 3803.31
done with you

3824.48 --> 3827.539
[Music]

3830.22 --> 3833.6499999999996
[Music]

3847.82 --> 3854.84
oh really reptilian Freemason is that

3852.2 --> 3857.4199999999996
his plan well there he goes

3854.84 --> 3862.09
nice start out with a giant straw man

3857.42 --> 3866.08
towards the designer that's really great

3862.09 --> 3866.08
ready so

3872.48 --> 3884.31
creation is not all about good it's just

3879.09 --> 3886.92
a the most optimal design path the best

3884.31 --> 3891.63
frequency an individual where the

3886.92 --> 3895.28
consciousness can follow is good is the

3891.63 --> 3898.86
path of Christ that doesn't mean that a

3895.28 --> 3901.8300000000004
presumed plan the design the grand

3898.86 --> 3905.81
design of the creator that that was

3901.83 --> 3910.77
specifically personified with a

3905.81 --> 3915.39
motivation to create heaven no I'm

3910.77 --> 3917.9
pretty sure the earth is a test it

3915.39 --> 3917.9
always was

3924.49 --> 3927.5699999999997
[Music]

3936.49 --> 3943.1499999999996
why would I concern myself with all

3939.64 --> 3949.99
these exit Erica's things reptilian

3943.15 --> 3952.83
Freemason do you even understand what

3949.99 --> 3952.83
that's really about

3975.7 --> 3986.6699999999996
oh really so you're gonna divine now

3978.52 --> 3993.64
what everybody here believes what was

3986.67 --> 3996.4
well you got it wrong your straw Manning

3993.64 --> 3998.89
it because again I knew you were gonna

3996.4 --> 4000.869
do that because that's what all the

3998.89 --> 4004.5299999999997
people out there that don't like it do

4000.869 --> 4008.04
they all go for the exoteric they all

4004.53 --> 4010.349
say oh this happened that happened so

4008.04 --> 4013.44
it's all physically literal that is a

4010.349 --> 4017.2200000000003
literal historical thing that happens in

4013.44 --> 4020.069
a literal sense right other side that is

4017.22 --> 4022.68
what you believe right now that's called

4020.069 --> 4026.21
a straw man you do it with Flat Earth

4022.68 --> 4026.21
models too all the time

4037.95 --> 4043.41
I think that the supposed falling of

4041.46 --> 4048.39
Lucifer into the material realm is a

4043.41 --> 4051.3289999999997
very complex esoteric thing it's

4048.39 --> 4053.339
probably not there's probably better

4051.329 --> 4055.5
ways to actually describe all that

4053.339 --> 4059.0099999999998
although there might be more elaborate

4055.5 --> 4060.869
parts that I've never heard of from like

4059.01 --> 4062.369
outside of the Bible or that were

4060.869 --> 4064.02
slightly excluded I don't know you know

4062.369 --> 4069.9
the Bible was a huge work I haven't

4064.02 --> 4072.0
actually read it but I don't know if

4069.9 --> 4076.4700000000003
there was a literal being going down

4072.0 --> 4079.109
like that there might have been or it is

4076.47 --> 4082.2
a purely a satirical description that

4079.109 --> 4085.5589999999997
just reveals the challenge of the

4082.2 --> 4089.1899999999996
earthly realm the ego that is just there

4085.559 --> 4093.9
it will always be there it is yeah it is

4089.19 --> 4096.6900000000005
the realm of the six of the beasts that

4093.9 --> 4098.31
is part of all things it becomes part of

4096.69 --> 4099.54
all things as a side effect of

4098.31 --> 4101.88
consciousness itself

4099.54 --> 4103.98
I have presumed personally it's my

4101.88 --> 4109.259
personal research my personal insights

4103.98 --> 4111.0599999999995
philosophy so is that what the fall of

4109.259 --> 4116.069
Lucifer into the material realm

4111.06 --> 4118.17
describes that yeah God or the original

4116.069 --> 4122.1
designer designed it all in a specific

4118.17 --> 4126.4800000000005
way to be perfect but the material realm

4122.1 --> 4130.259
just would not allow it and even in the

4126.48 --> 4136.139999999999
heavens the the angels were divided and

4130.259 --> 4140.94
then proceeded to alter it to fill up

4136.14 --> 4142.5
what was inevitable as it were see it's

4140.94 --> 4144.87
it all depends on how you're gonna look

4142.5 --> 4151.199
at it I very much prefer to look at

4144.87 --> 4153.239
these things esoterically but who knows

4151.199 --> 4155.94
there may have been some kind of bizarre

4153.239 --> 4158.129999999999
exoteric event you know the the myth of

4155.94 --> 4160.249
a giant black dragon falling down to

4158.13 --> 4172.329
earth

4160.249 --> 4172.329
I don't know hmm

4173.529 --> 4177.429
anyway I'll be right back

4270.96 --> 4273.96
EAL

4303.98 --> 4309.379999999999
okay Chris Parker suit yourself if you

4307.31 --> 4313.0
don't like what the way I talk here then

4309.38 --> 4313.0
yeah by all means piss off

4319.67 --> 4326.22
you really think it matters to me if you

4323.58 --> 4331.2
don't like what I have to say think that

4326.22 --> 4332.97
can undermine my security about the

4331.2 --> 4333.8
things that I'm talking about I don't

4332.97 --> 4336.84
think so

4333.8 --> 4341.570000000001
you can try to troll me all day long but

4336.84 --> 4341.57
hey how successful is that going so far

4343.46 --> 4348.12
none of you got anything you have no

4346.29 --> 4349.26
case you have a bunch of red herrings

4348.12 --> 4351.39
you have straw man

4349.26 --> 4354.66
you have your slippery nature you have

4351.39 --> 4357.030000000001
your little devil body that tell you

4354.66 --> 4360.72
exactly how to lie to get through this

4357.03 --> 4363.929999999999
nonsense for this religious nonsense

4360.72 --> 4370.490000000001
train of yours this religion of

4363.93 --> 4374.400000000001
hollowness and lies it's not working

4370.49 --> 4377.599999999999
so just squirm and do whatever you need

4374.4 --> 4377.599999999999
to do it's not gonna work

4382.789 --> 4385.42
yeah

4386.83 --> 4394.5
yeah it is oh yeah

4390.13 --> 4401.53
atheists are religious yes they are

4394.5 --> 4405.18
Jorah dokdo atheism is a religion yeah

4401.53 --> 4405.179999999999
why don't you look it up

4410.9 --> 4413.95
[Music]

4428.719 --> 4432.52
yeah the enemy can I know

4439.959 --> 4452.289
oh I completely forgotten yeah I could

4444.429 --> 4456.07
have gotten Anthony on sleeping warrior

4452.289 --> 4458.228999999999
but I kind of forgot although this type

4456.07 --> 4461.978999999999
of discussion is not too much for him

4458.229 --> 4465.150000000001
anyway so maybe I'll have them on

4461.979 --> 4465.150000000001
tomorrow or something

4480.34 --> 4491.7390000000005
so what jazz with actor really what's

4486.679 --> 4491.7390000000005
your proof eel decline it's ridiculous

4498.619 --> 4508.199
do you even know what basically the

4504.3 --> 4512.039
narrative of Jesuits are do you even

4508.199 --> 4517.11
know real decline such a bizarre thing

4512.039 --> 4520.44
to say I can't just call anyone a Jesuit

4517.11 --> 4528.659
that's just totally dumb think that

4520.44 --> 4530.759999999999
anybody can be a J's oh sorry okay if

4528.659 --> 4534.388999999999
you got some actual arguments to back

4530.76 --> 4536.219
that that claim on or that rumor I'm

4534.389 --> 4537.63
even gonna call it a claim at this point

4536.219 --> 4540.92
and I'd like to hear about it you know

4537.63 --> 4544.769
but just go people

4540.92 --> 4547.499
chazzy wits without any actual in

4544.769 --> 4555.17
content backup for for that statement

4547.499 --> 4555.17
it's just it's just so tiresome

4571.37 --> 4576.8
yeah yeah yeah the kind I know I know

4574.76 --> 4580.6
could it be because he just really

4576.8 --> 4580.6
freaking believes in the spinning ball

4584.77 --> 4590.92
you know there's there's more people out

4587.42 --> 4594.88
there that that'll go with everything

4590.92 --> 4597.08
everything that is well basically

4594.88 --> 4602.12
creationist all that will bla bla

4597.08 --> 4604.76
creationist religious spiritual all

4602.12 --> 4607.099999999999
kinds of things but they'll still hold

4604.76 --> 4610.01
on to a ball they don't even care what

4607.1 --> 4612.29
that ball is in it will stop caring

4610.01 --> 4615.860000000001
about outer space potentially but they

4612.29 --> 4619.73
just can't get rid of that freakin ball

4615.86 --> 4622.67
image especially the older generations

4619.73 --> 4626.33
gonna have even more trouble with that

4622.67 --> 4628.85
if they are a typical speaker so can

4626.33 --> 4629.87
joven you know he's not a really young

4628.85 --> 4634.610000000001
guy anymore

4629.87 --> 4636.89
so I'm over the whole thing I'm not

4634.61 --> 4642.5
really that surprised that he's holding

4636.89 --> 4644.72
on to the ball it may simply be kind of

4642.5 --> 4648.41
like a political tactical decision the

4644.72 --> 4652.13
guys already been to jail over all the

4648.41 --> 4654.43
friction that's just come out of the the

4652.13 --> 4657.43
whole creation versus evolution debate

4654.43 --> 4657.43
so

4661.26 --> 4668.1900000000005
ten as long as his actual in-content

4665.22 --> 4669.87
arguments are good he can argue for the

4668.19 --> 4672.389999999999
ball all he wants it'll just make him

4669.87 --> 4675.05
look like a dumbass or somebody that

4672.39 --> 4676.17
can't let go but as long as his

4675.05 --> 4680.1
in-content

4676.17 --> 4685.11
arguments for creationism which he has a

4680.1 --> 4686.9400000000005
lot of as long as they are good and I

4685.11 --> 4691.32
don't care if he believes in the ball or

4686.94 --> 4692.129999999999
not I really don't let him do what he's

4691.32 --> 4705.389999999999
good at

4692.13 --> 4707.75
I care about his ball beliefs yes sure

4705.39 --> 4707.75
he did

4743.23 --> 4750.98
yeah I don't know

4746.3 --> 4753.2300000000005
atheism even acknowledged ISM it's

4750.98 --> 4757.37
basically a straw man of the entire

4753.23 --> 4761.24
premise in my personal opinion like all

4757.37 --> 4763.5199999999995
these things are so-so personified

4761.24 --> 4766.61
there's such a personified angle to

4763.52 --> 4770.63
things it's just I don't even know why

4766.61 --> 4775.19
people get stuck on that angle of

4770.63 --> 4778.96
approach why did why they don't just

4775.19 --> 4778.96
ascend it

4809.11 --> 4814.659
well whatever you want Jordan

4867.699 --> 4875.139999999999
that's weird yep I've in several such

4872.26 --> 4877.360000000001
yeah yeah whatever you do is you do join

4875.14 --> 4879.25
up now but I've been in situations where

4877.36 --> 4881.71
I thought death that's what death was

4879.25 --> 4885.989
imminent and two things could happen

4881.71 --> 4889.36
either I be come afraid and I'd let my

4885.989 --> 4891.79
survival instincts basically take a lot

4889.36 --> 4894.339999999999
of control over my energies in order to

4891.79 --> 4896.8
find a way out and practically start

4894.34 --> 4901.2390000000005
ignoring things as I go just to survive

4896.8 --> 4902.9800000000005
just to be able to have a certainty that

4901.239 --> 4906.089999999999
I would be able to find a way out and

4902.98 --> 4909.28
not get distracted get caught out or I

4906.09 --> 4911.17
would literally have a lot of grip over

4909.28 --> 4914.17
everything and realize more and more

4911.17 --> 4918.13
that yeah it's just whatever's gonna

4914.17 --> 4922.2390000000005
happen is gonna happen and creation

4918.13 --> 4925.4800000000005
accounts for that as it were that if you

4922.239 --> 4928.419999999999
are walking the right path then how

4925.48 --> 4933.19
things will come on your path from that

4928.42 --> 4937.33
point will be proper it will be there is

4933.19 --> 4938.949
like a unique thing where if you do the

4937.33 --> 4940.12
right thing in life then right things

4938.949 --> 4942.82
will come to you

4940.12 --> 4945.34
it's very missed mysterious in a way but

4942.82 --> 4947.86
it does actually happen and there's so

4945.34 --> 4951.400000000001
much to do with what you're carrying

4947.86 --> 4953.799999999999
inside what your spirit is like in the

4951.4 --> 4955.75
spiritual scene and the new agey scene

4953.8 --> 4957.34
they call it resonances like wherever

4955.75 --> 4958.9
your frequency is that that's what

4957.34 --> 4959.9800000000005
you're going to touch upon that's what

4958.9 --> 4961.239
you're going to find that's what you're

4959.98 --> 4963.37
going to recognize that's what you're

4961.239 --> 4965.62
going to see and if something is not of

4963.37 --> 4971.08
your frequency you just won't even pick

4965.62 --> 4972.79
it up and that is a real practical way

4971.08 --> 4976.09
to go but you don't even need to be

4972.79 --> 4980.53
religious or believer in anything for

4976.09 --> 4985.29
that to work you just need to have some

4980.53 --> 4985.29
sensibility and some feel that's all

5002.94 --> 5011.29
why would a theist have a

5005.199 --> 5021.969
self-preservation instinct yeah it seems

5011.29 --> 5024.9
like a strawman question but everybody

5021.969 --> 5029.65
has a psychological self-preservation

5024.9 --> 5031.179
instinct and as an atheist what's gonna

5029.65 --> 5033.82
happen is because you can't really

5031.179 --> 5035.11
overlook what what our religion is

5033.82 --> 5036.549999999999
really about or why people behave

5035.11 --> 5039.759999999999
exactly the way they do you just

5036.55 --> 5042.37
identify it as a certain religion you

5039.76 --> 5044.2300000000005
don't really look into why why they act

5042.37 --> 5047.679
the way they do in the bigger meaning of

5044.23 --> 5051.82
it so then the default personal response

5047.679 --> 5054.46
will be like I don't want to be the real

5051.82 --> 5057.12
in my current state of mind in which I

5054.46 --> 5060.7300000000005
have some oversight or so I think I

5057.12 --> 5063.3099999999995
don't want that religion that is outside

5060.73 --> 5067.089999999999
of my frame of mind I don't want that to

5063.31 --> 5069.25
rub off so I'm going to have a defensive

5067.09 --> 5075.01
attitude not assimilate the information

5069.25 --> 5077.35
but see it as hostile but then yeah you

5075.01 --> 5079.27
don't you you won't progress your

5077.35 --> 5082.2300000000005
understanding and inside of what they're

5079.27 --> 5082.2300000000005
saying when you do that

5087.01 --> 5091.09
I used that that's what it's kind of a

5089.95 --> 5093.489
similar cycle

5091.09 --> 5097.03
yeah social psychological mechanism is

5093.489 --> 5098.65
what feeds the whole baller situation

5097.03 --> 5102.75
but they've just weaponized the whole

5098.65 --> 5105.489
thing it's become so insanely extreme

5102.75 --> 5108.87
beyond all reason ability I don't

5105.489 --> 5111.639999999999
understand why people would let them

5108.87 --> 5116.89
fall into such level of rudimentary

5111.64 --> 5118.6900000000005
behavior it's bizarre to me that their

5116.89 --> 5126.4890000000005
instincts would not prevent them from

5118.69 --> 5130.839999999999
going that far anyway I think I'm gonna

5126.489 --> 5135.61
round out the show before more people

5130.84 --> 5137.59
mence to get themselves banned anyway

5135.61 --> 5138.2699999999995
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

5137.59 --> 5140.56
