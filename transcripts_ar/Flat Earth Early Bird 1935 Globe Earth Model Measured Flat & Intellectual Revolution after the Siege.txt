today it's pretty

106.56 --> 114.92
hot feels like a real summer day

111.2 --> 114.92
actually it's been really

115.039 --> 121.2
sunny a bit of wind but the wind's not

118.439 --> 125.119
hard and

121.2 --> 128.96
and warm so it's like really warm

125.119 --> 128.96
outside got cooked

129.319 --> 136.72
here but yeah I did get out pretty

132.76 --> 140.48
early cuz the

136.72 --> 143.84
mechanic is repairing the internet

140.48 --> 146.67999999999998
cable and that worked out pretty

143.84 --> 151.56
much until right before the show so I

146.68 --> 151.56
got stable landline internet again

152.239 --> 158.28
which is

153.68 --> 158.28
great finally don't have to worry about

158.519 --> 166.76
that wireless crap right next to

163.239 --> 169.76
me I am quite

166.76 --> 169.76
relieved

175.519 --> 181.84
right oh it was very

178.28 --> 181.84
early Moxy

187.48 --> 194.84
right anyway it

189.92 --> 194.83999999999997
is Wednesday the 1st of May

198.88 --> 202.009
[Applause]

203.48 --> 211.72
2024 temperature is

206.44 --> 215.159
24° C wow still 59% humidity yeah I can

211.72 --> 215.159
feel that it is still very

215.599 --> 222.04
moist o so it's a really warm day today

219.2 --> 225.319
and so will tomorrow be and then it will

222.04 --> 228.04
cool down again oh

225.319 --> 230.2
okay right

228.04 --> 235.56
anyhow

230.2 --> 235.56
today is a nice day

236.28 --> 242.72
H and everything worked out quickly

240.159 --> 246.67999999999998
turns out

242.72 --> 248.68
that the guy downstairs who's like who

246.68 --> 252.48000000000002
just moved in there apparently a month

248.68 --> 255.28
ago had his internet uh installed and

252.48 --> 259.759
that's when it happened like apparently

255.28 --> 261.12
they damaged the cable in the process

259.759 --> 266.199
and so that's

261.12 --> 266.199
fixed and everything's back to normal

290.24 --> 295.96000000000004
right so let's see who rolls in here

306.96 --> 310.96
ah yeah hello Moxy good to see you

309.32 --> 313.84
looking good in white today yeah yeah

310.96 --> 317.23999999999995
yeah my new white

313.84 --> 320.15999999999997
shirt and I saved it I bought that like

317.24 --> 323.08
a week ago but it's yeah specifically

320.16 --> 325.28000000000003
for a situation like this so I'm like

323.08 --> 328.639
nice and light colored and everything

325.28 --> 328.63899999999995
hello Frank

340.759 --> 346.16
right so yeah a good night

343.24 --> 350.12
rest although there was like this huge

346.16 --> 353.36
lightning storm yesterday night like all

350.12 --> 356.039
night all night up

353.36 --> 359.639
until like

356.039 --> 362.52
3:00 but man was it like lightning all

359.639 --> 362.52
all over the place

363.16 --> 368.40000000000003
continuous but uh yeah that's a good

366.639 --> 369.88
thing I mean that sort of thing clears

368.4 --> 372.479
the air a

369.88 --> 375.88
lot but like it just wouldn't stop

372.479 --> 375.88
flashing and flashing and

379.639 --> 384.039
thundering not too much rain though but

382.24 --> 386.44
enough for there to be a lot of moist in

384.039 --> 386.44
the air

388.44 --> 393.4
currently right right so yesterday was

391.0 --> 395.68
another ball busters the continuation I

393.4 --> 398.039
didn't know there was going to

395.68 --> 401.28000000000003
be but yeah I was part of that but my

398.039 --> 404.4
sound really sucked for some reason it's

401.28 --> 406.23999999999995
just like absurdly low volume and I

404.4 --> 409.79999999999995
didn't know

406.24 --> 411.44
why like I kept logging out and back in

409.8 --> 415.56
again in

411.44 --> 418.08
Discord but it just wouldn't wouldn't be

415.56 --> 421.08
audible so I kind of mostly said in the

418.08 --> 421.08
background

425.479 --> 431.639
right but yeah that was the uh the

428.52 --> 433.19899999999996
continuation of the uh Wit It

431.639 --> 436.08
performance on

433.199 --> 441.24
Infowars and my God like that second

436.08 --> 441.24
part was just a mess it was a terrible

444.52 --> 450.35999999999996
mess right the first part was

447.84 --> 453.44
like like yeah it's just trying to stay

450.36 --> 455.319
amicable and but I mean eventually like

453.44 --> 457.599
it it came to the point where he did

455.319 --> 459.599
kind of probably accidentally did

457.599 --> 463.4
confessional debating from a flatter

459.599 --> 463.4
side which is like completely

464.96 --> 474.75899999999996
unnecessary so yeah kwi and the rest of

468.28 --> 474.75899999999996
the gang went loose on that a lot

499.199 --> 505.12
man things are working faster with this

501.759 --> 505.12
landline internet I'm really

506.24 --> 511.44
noticing the video quality is

508.68 --> 511.44
automatically

515.76 --> 521.8389999999999
oped cuz I had it set to kind of minimum

518.839 --> 525.599
to save data

521.839 --> 525.599
transfer Q's new

526.04 --> 534.1999999999999
song oh well yeah too bad for you Moxy I

530.24 --> 534.2
thought this song was hilarious

548.04 --> 553.279
I

549.24 --> 558.16
mean just be honest like that song was

553.279 --> 558.16
way better than the glow buster song way

563.959 --> 570.56
better so yeah Adam mein made that and

567.64 --> 573.64
yeah I mean he he

570.56 --> 577.4399999999999
probably use some kind of AI to arrange

573.64 --> 577.4399999999999
it but uh not bad at

585.6 --> 592.8000000000001
all uh yeah Moxy don't talk to trolls

589.079 --> 592.8
don't do that don't

600.04 --> 603.64
that that's the condition if you want to

601.64 --> 605.8
hang around this chat you don't talk to

603.64 --> 605.8
the

606.079 --> 614.1999999999999
trolls yeah don't play their

610.279 --> 617.4399999999999
games if if you can't do that then I

614.2 --> 619.8000000000001
will have to remove you yeah that's the

617.44 --> 622.8800000000001
condition and yes the trolls are out

619.8 --> 626.04
again they were yesterday also like nuts

622.88 --> 628.0
all over the place I have no idea why

626.04 --> 631.3199999999999
like they just crawled under from

628.0 --> 631.32
underneath a rock or something

643.8 --> 648.3599999999999
right but no I thought that kiwi song

646.839 --> 651.8800000000001
was pretty

648.36 --> 651.88
cool I mean it's

653.8 --> 658.399
a it was a bit Overkill

661.56 --> 664.3599999999999
but also

667.16 --> 673.6
hilarious like there were some funny

669.839 --> 675.8800000000001
jokes in there and that really balanced

673.6 --> 679.639
out the

675.88 --> 683.2
overkill praising basically of it I

679.639 --> 683.2
thought it was great

709.92 --> 714.68
if you want to listen to that song and

712.32 --> 714.6800000000001
here it

716.32 --> 724.9200000000001
is made by Adam pretty pretty

720.36 --> 724.92
epic I mean it is a pretty epic made

744.0 --> 749.519
song Hey Kevlar good to see you

752.519 --> 758.399
did you say Q didn't no

758.56 --> 765.4799999999999
did there was a Adam made a song about

762.24 --> 768.92
him I I suspect that he used some AI

765.48 --> 772.36
tool to do it I don't think that was a

768.92 --> 775.4399999999999
real singer but I mean it's pretty

772.36 --> 780.6
impressive and the text

775.44 --> 780.6
was very quey and hilarious

788.8 --> 792.04
familiar I don't know what you're

790.519 --> 796.92
talking about

792.04 --> 796.92
Moxy just don't talk to trolls

811.44 --> 814.7600000000001
Lo is them by their

824.639 --> 828.88
yes right so yeah that was

837.32 --> 841.639
yesterday I thought the show pretty

852.0 --> 856.72
good although it was already kind of

854.72 --> 861.0400000000001
like riddled with trolls so yesterday

856.72 --> 861.0400000000001
was just a very trollish day

897.079 --> 900.079
uh

900.24 --> 906.399
right so yeah of course yesterday

902.959 --> 908.6389999999999
all me criticizing neonian mechanics

906.399 --> 911.36
being debunked and oh nobody could have

908.639 --> 914.44
it so it's it's the usual same people

911.36 --> 917.92
that have been blabbering the same

914.44 --> 920.6800000000001
garbage for the last six years they did

917.92 --> 923.24
their same [ __ ] over and over again of

920.68 --> 926.199
course yesterday I was kind of tired of

923.24 --> 927.9590000000001
it so I mean I did respond to some and

926.199 --> 931.959
just I'm just not going to do it anymore

927.959 --> 934.279
I mean there's already like six shows in

931.959 --> 937.8
which exactly that happens and it keeps

934.279 --> 940.279
telling him like I'm

937.8 --> 942.3599999999999
done I'm done with it I'm just going to

940.279 --> 946.0
tell you how it is and then

942.36 --> 948.88

946.0 --> 951.36

951.36 --> 954.9590000000001

953.319 --> 957.519
going to complain and going to project

954.959 --> 959.8389999999999
unto me like Oh no you're the one that's

957.519 --> 962.72

it I mean last time he a while ago he

2069.28 --> 2074.2000000000003
to whine about what I should and

2072.24 --> 2077.2
shouldn't talk about and it's none of

2074.2 --> 2080.0
his [ __ ] business what I talk about

2077.2 --> 2082.1589999999997
yeah nobody tells me what I talk about

2080.0 --> 2083.839
and what I don't talk about I will

2082.159 --> 2087.2000000000003
decide what I talk

2083.839 --> 2089.24
about I will decide what you are allowed

2087.2 --> 2092.359
to talk about in my

2089.24 --> 2095.9599999999996
chat and that's the way it is it's not

2092.359 --> 2095.96
going to change

2122.72 --> 2128.0
[Music]

2124.48 --> 2130.44
been H Loop too long yeah I mean these

2128.0 --> 2133.64
people are [ __ ] mental basket cases I

2130.44 --> 2133.64
don't know what the hell is going

2143.16 --> 2146.16
on

2146.64 --> 2150.5989999999997
yeah you might not really see all that

2149.28 --> 2153.0400000000004
much if you're watching the show

2150.599 --> 2154.56
afterward because I am deleting a whole

2153.04 --> 2159.52
bunch of

2154.56 --> 2159.52
people but if you want to know

2160.44 --> 2166.119
who they are then just go and watch

2162.72 --> 2170.839
Quantum eraser Channel cuz yesterday

2166.119 --> 2173.6400000000003
they were like 34 to four fifths of

2170.839 --> 2176.7999999999997
every conversation that was happening in

2173.64 --> 2178.359
there and diversion Droid was just weigh

2176.8 --> 2181.079
in over his

2178.359 --> 2183.359
head even Neil started to complain about

2181.079 --> 2185.1600000000003
it eventually like there's nothing I can

2183.359 --> 2188.359
do about it I

2185.16 --> 2190.56
mean you could just kick him out

2188.359 --> 2190.56
you

2191.96 --> 2198.64
know like I do but they refused to do

2196.04 --> 2201.48
all of that

2198.64 --> 2203.7999999999997
so has there been more trolls since I

2201.48 --> 2210.0
stopped going to

2203.8 --> 2210.0
Fed it happened before I before I left

2225.96 --> 2230.0
all right but it's just mostly

2237.8 --> 2243.76
today yeah I know Moxy I don't know what

2241.8 --> 2245.6800000000003
the [ __ ] happened with that guy like I

2243.76 --> 2247.599
don't even understand like why he

2245.68 --> 2252.52
suddenly flipped around the way he did

2247.599 --> 2252.52
it made no damn sense to me I didn't do

2256.04 --> 2261.56
anything

2257.64 --> 2264.1189999999997
but he somehow feels hurt and nothing I

2261.56 --> 2267.92
say or do changes that and

2264.119 --> 2270.52
he just needs all day long therapy

2267.92 --> 2273.6800000000003
therapy following me around everywhere I

2270.52 --> 2276.16
go and just like spamming his nonsense

2273.68 --> 2277.96
and sock accounts in the chats

2276.16 --> 2280.7599999999998
everywhere I mean

2277.96 --> 2282.56
that guy's [ __ ] deranged should be

2280.76 --> 2285.3190000000004
committed to an asylum and have a

2282.56 --> 2290.16
complete internet

2285.319 --> 2290.16
ban like work through it

2290.52 --> 2293.75
[Music]

2310.16 --> 2317.7599999999998
wow this [ __ ] sock account is

2314.599 --> 2320.44
literally making new accounts and then

2317.76 --> 2326.28
as soon as I ban them deleting them and

2320.44 --> 2329.16
making a new one wow you're [ __ ]

2326.28 --> 2333.8390000000004
insane can't believe that YouTube isn't

2329.16 --> 2333.839
just like blocking your IP address

2341.76 --> 2348.88
look for new recruits

2345.88 --> 2348.88
what

2350.599 --> 2355.079
uh I don't know who you heard that

2359.86 --> 2363.96
[Music]

2361.079 --> 2366.5600000000004
from but hey you want to be part of the

2363.96 --> 2369.359
show you want to have a conversation you

2366.56 --> 2369.359
want to

2369.52 --> 2372.44
be here that's

2385.56 --> 2390.48
cool lot of time on their hands

2398.68 --> 2405.2799999999997
yeah and very little good priority I

2401.52 --> 2405.28
mean it makes no damn

2409.8 --> 2415.96
sense all right anyhow kind of looking

2412.92 --> 2420.2400000000002
forward to Friday

2415.96 --> 2420.2400000000002
show that I'm going to do with David

2421.28 --> 2426.52
Weiss I'm yeah not having super high

2424.359 --> 2428.04
expectations of it's just going to be an

2426.52 --> 2430.2
interesting conversation ation and

2428.04 --> 2433.119
hopefully like even like connect a bit

2430.2 --> 2436.04
back to the old days cuz I do want to

2433.119 --> 2440.56
compare the old days to the new days

2436.04 --> 2440.56
like the scene has just changed

2445.88 --> 2452.92
enormously like and the feel that the

2448.64 --> 2452.92
spirit that's going around has also

2454.2 --> 2460.3999999999996
changed and the world itself are ARA

2457.72 --> 2463.68
Chang all these crazy

2460.4 --> 2467.28
things especially in 2020 I mean that

2463.68 --> 2470.68
just seemed to change everything and

2467.28 --> 2472.44
made everything people

2470.68 --> 2475.52
reprioritize and

2472.44 --> 2478.76
there's a

2475.52 --> 2481.56
grimness it's like a a level of grimness

2478.76 --> 2483.44
that has settled in with a lot of people

2481.56 --> 2486.7999999999997
like including like

2483.44 --> 2489.359
conspiracy article commenters like I Pi

2486.8 --> 2492.2400000000002
I keep track of that kind of thing I

2489.359 --> 2494.88
when there's some news article or

2492.24 --> 2497.839
whatever I look at the comments I've

2494.88 --> 2497.839
been doing that

2498.24 --> 2502.8799999999997
for 20

2501.0 --> 2505.92
years to

2502.88 --> 2507.76
see how people change their mind and

2505.92 --> 2511.56
like how much of it is just like an

2507.76 --> 2513.96
automated post and or somebody actually

2511.56 --> 2515.68
logically you can just deduce that

2513.96 --> 2517.76
whether they're just writing something

2515.68 --> 2519.839
in the moment

2517.76 --> 2523.5200000000004
and there's a lot more automated

2519.839 --> 2527.44
messages now all over the

2523.52 --> 2530.44
place I think that people are using AI

2527.44 --> 2532.599
systems to do like artificial commenters

2530.44 --> 2535.599
in a certain

2532.599 --> 2535.599
direction

2535.68 --> 2541.52
influencers and there is just a lot of

2538.359 --> 2541.52
people that are like

2542.839 --> 2547.96
professional social media yeah opinion

2546.44 --> 2550.48
givers and

2547.96 --> 2552.0
and all that and researchers and

2550.48 --> 2556.119
conspiracy

2552.0 --> 2556.119
theorists there's a lot more of

2556.24 --> 2561.8799999999997
that but they all share similar traits

2559.76 --> 2564.3590000000004
and that is that they're all against

2561.88 --> 2567.359
Flat Earth

2564.359 --> 2570.68
though oh so many

2567.359 --> 2573.92
people have started to fill up social

2570.68 --> 2576.359
media that'll entertain

2573.92 --> 2577.6800000000003
absolutely everything you could ever

2576.359 --> 2580.359
think of

2577.68 --> 2584.68
they will talk about anything anything

2580.359 --> 2586.2
at all but Flat Earth no no no that's

2584.68 --> 2589.16
just

2586.2 --> 2591.4399999999996
[ __ ] that's where we would just be

2589.16 --> 2591.44
like

2591.839 --> 2598.0789999999997
Harrison with the

2594.16 --> 2600.5989999999997
interview with the debate with wit it

2598.079 --> 2603.48
and just assert a bunch of things and

2600.599 --> 2605.88
and then don't bring any proof just made

2603.48 --> 2607.64
weird claims not not even elaborate on

2605.88 --> 2610.28
the technicalities of like how those

2607.64 --> 2613.16
claims work or anything like no

2610.28 --> 2615.6800000000003
knowledge just blank assertion and Flat

2613.16 --> 2618.1189999999997
Earth is stupid because the globe Earth

2615.68 --> 2622.3999999999996
model works better oh

2618.119 --> 2622.4
really not without a flat Earth it

2624.359 --> 2628.0
doesn't right so that's something that

2627.16 --> 2631.7599999999998
I've

2628.0 --> 2632.839
noticed and I think that that overall

2631.76 --> 2636.0400000000004
Change

2632.839 --> 2638.5589999999997
of Atmosphere the feeling wise

2636.04 --> 2642.0
atmosphere on the Internet is just

2638.559 --> 2642.0
caused a lot of people to

2644.16 --> 2649.1189999999997
basically lose their natural

2649.319 --> 2654.04
Goodwill and turn into

2652.119 --> 2656.76
these time

2654.04 --> 2661.119
wasting hating

2656.76 --> 2661.119
people which is like a giant

2661.44 --> 2667.2400000000002
shame and I wonder if they're just all

2664.319 --> 2670.319
really really disappointed with life so

2667.24 --> 2674.64
something yeah and I face similar

2670.319 --> 2676.64
issues I face some issues with

2674.64 --> 2680.7599999999998
that

2676.64 --> 2682.7999999999997
but yeah you just because you might be

2680.76 --> 2684.8390000000004
disappointed in certain things doesn't

2682.8 --> 2687.92
mean that you can then just give up and

2684.839 --> 2690.92
become a complete [ __ ]

2687.92 --> 2693.6800000000003
scumbag just like Let Yourself Go and

2690.92 --> 2696.2000000000003
just make other people miserable just so

2693.68 --> 2698.24
you don't have to feel your own

2696.2 --> 2702.52
disappointment with yourself and your

2698.24 --> 2705.2799999999997
life and how the world's gone

2702.52 --> 2707.04
it's I mean if you're going to be like

2705.28 --> 2709.599
that then

2707.04 --> 2712.04
just maybe you should remove yourself

2709.599 --> 2715.4
from the world you know if it's that bad

2712.04 --> 2715.4
just get out of

2715.599 --> 2719.6800000000003
it get out of your life

2721.24 --> 2726.1189999999997
setup figure out something more durable

2724.119 --> 2728.6400000000003
a more durable direction do something

2726.119 --> 2731.04
better with your life but I mean if you

2728.64 --> 2735.5589999999997
can't handle the way everything is to

2731.04 --> 2739.24
the point where you just have to nag and

2735.559 --> 2741.3590000000004
whine to other people and like spend all

2739.24 --> 2743.64
that time to just like get underneath

2741.359 --> 2746.319
their skin and try to make them

2743.64 --> 2746.319
miserable

2746.88 --> 2752.88
then you're wasting your time a lot more

2750.04 --> 2755.24
than I am cuz at least I'm trying to do

2752.88 --> 2757.88
my best

2755.24 --> 2761.4799999999996
here I'm trying to stay stay positive I

2757.88 --> 2764.119
am working on my attitude all the time

2761.48 --> 2766.76
self-reflection Improvement interactive

2764.119 --> 2768.88
social interaction

2766.76 --> 2770.8
Improvement right because I think about

2768.88 --> 2776.28
a lot of things Ponder upon a lot of

2770.8 --> 2778.96
things but doing social interactions

2776.28 --> 2781.0400000000004
interactively that's always been kind of

2778.96 --> 2784.079
like difficult for

2781.04 --> 2787.4
me have to like really make effort to

2784.079 --> 2790.2000000000003
adjust that and especially actually 10

2787.4 --> 2793.359
years ago it just was a lot tougher

2790.2 --> 2795.359
because it's like too much energy in a

2793.359 --> 2799.119
way I like over

2795.359 --> 2801.96
respond and well 10 years older

2799.119 --> 2804.2000000000003
now I feel I have a lot more control

2801.96 --> 2804.2
over

2805.72 --> 2811.3999999999996
it right anyway I'm going to get my

2808.76 --> 2811.4
Illuminati

2811.96 --> 2817.4
croissant and my coffee I'll be right

2814.4 --> 2817.4
back

2846.88 --> 2849.88
e

2885.22 --> 2890.7599999999998
[Music]

2886.48 --> 2890.76
hey fibs good to see you

2909.92 --> 2914.48
they're attacking they're attacking yeah

2912.559 --> 2916.1600000000003
fibr outs I mean we could talk about

2914.48 --> 2919.64
that what they're killing

2916.16 --> 2919.64
you that's not

2925.48 --> 2932.04
good but yeah FIB they're going

2929.079 --> 2935.599
around they're going around they're

2932.04 --> 2939.96
hungry and it's and it's logical though

2935.599 --> 2939.96
I mean just look at the what's happening

2940.44 --> 2947.76
like there's a giant monolithic

2944.72 --> 2950.2799999999997
government and corporate conspiracy a

2947.76 --> 2954.7200000000003
fascist conspiracy

2950.28 --> 2956.6400000000003
against a large part of the world like

2954.72 --> 2958.9599999999996
and they're out in the open and they're

2956.64 --> 2961.2799999999997
like being very egregious about what

2958.96 --> 2964.44
they do and how they do it and they're

2961.28 --> 2967.6800000000003
flaunting it when that sort of stuff

2964.44 --> 2970.559
happens then demons go around and like

2967.68 --> 2972.2
they try to collect

2970.559 --> 2977.6800000000003
Souls

2972.2 --> 2979.68
right they try to make us us people that

2977.68 --> 2982.7599999999998
aren't part of the

2979.68 --> 2984.0789999999997
fascists they try to make us their

2982.76 --> 2988.079
victims

2984.079 --> 2991.44
their their sacrifices for their demons

2988.079 --> 2994.599
so they go around and try to burden and

2991.44 --> 2998.28
snatch the sensitive and get them killed

2994.599 --> 2998.28
even if they can

2999.64 --> 3004.68
right so yeah sensitive people are going

3002.599 --> 3007.88
to be the target of

3004.68 --> 3011.359
that like

3007.88 --> 3015.2400000000002
even if they're not like directly

3011.359 --> 3017.68
targeting you consciously then it comes

3015.24 --> 3021.5989999999997
through other people if you're

3017.68 --> 3025.5989999999997
sensitive like these Spirits these

3021.599 --> 3027.52
demons they roam around in the vacated

3025.599 --> 3029.4
and they they might vacated might not

3027.52 --> 3033.16
even have attention for

3029.4 --> 3036.52
you consciously but then still by

3033.16 --> 3040.72
bumping into them bumping into that

3036.52 --> 3043.359
Essence the demons rub off on

3040.72 --> 3045.52
you and then that will haunt you and

3043.359 --> 3048.5589999999997
that that is where really the technique

3045.52 --> 3048.559
is so incredibly

3048.92 --> 3054.7200000000003
useful because it's

3051.4 --> 3059.04
specifically stops

3054.72 --> 3062.319
that it can remove move that specific

3059.04 --> 3065.4
influence on you and that's very helpful

3062.319 --> 3068.68
if you're very sensitive and you are

3065.4 --> 3071.04
fibroid you are a very sensitive person

3068.68 --> 3073.9199999999996
don't want it to

3071.04 --> 3077.2
be so

3073.92 --> 3079.64
what I mean you're suffering under it I

3077.2 --> 3082.799
was suffering under it

3079.64 --> 3085.839
greatly in the last few months so we all

3082.799 --> 3088.559
got a a giant slap in the face

3085.839 --> 3088.5589999999997
spiritually

3091.16 --> 3097.7599999999998
right I mean the the

3094.24 --> 3101.64
whole Eclipse event really was turns out

3097.76 --> 3103.92
to be a big slap in the in the face in

3101.64 --> 3103.92
many

3104.24 --> 3108.24
ways that

3130.2 --> 3134.96
Say the Name of Jesus and they will yeah

3132.4 --> 3137.079
it's not that simple borders boy but I

3134.96 --> 3139.599
mean that is definitely a part it is

3137.079 --> 3139.599
part of the

3140.4 --> 3147.4
technique just don't be sorry

3144.319 --> 3150.04
fots consider you my friend

3147.4 --> 3151.0
a loyal supporter I know you're not a

3150.04 --> 3154.4
bad

3151.0 --> 3158.96
person don't worry about

3154.4 --> 3161.6800000000003
it here to help yeah despite oh it's so

3158.96 --> 3166.079
delusional I'm so

3161.68 --> 3166.0789999999997
delusional yeah no I can't actually

3167.72 --> 3171.04
help and I

3173.599 --> 3181.04
will yeah you're you're just having a

3177.2 --> 3181.04
tough time we're here to

3183.96 --> 3186.96
help

3194.76 --> 3200.2400000000002
right I will apply the technique to you

3197.359 --> 3202.52
right now if if you're okay with that if

3200.24 --> 3204.3999999999996
you're open for that and that should

3202.52 --> 3208.44
stabilize you somewhat I mean it's not

3204.4 --> 3208.44
going to be a permanent

3208.799 --> 3214.52
fix because I know how this

3211.76 --> 3217.2000000000003
works it's like a temporary fix you have

3214.52 --> 3220.4
to keep doing it

3217.2 --> 3222.2
until the phase is over because these

3220.4 --> 3225.52
kind of things what you're experiencing

3222.2 --> 3228.799
what I was experienced come in phases in

3225.52 --> 3231.24
a period of time sometimes unfortunately

3228.799 --> 3233.839
that period of time can be kind of long

3231.24 --> 3236.52
and then you have to like you will feel

3233.839 --> 3238.72
in that time like oh I've become insane

3236.52 --> 3242.119
and I've become mentally

3238.72 --> 3246.4399999999996
ill but that's

3242.119 --> 3249.44
temporary yeah I'm pretty much at the

3246.44 --> 3253.4
end of of such a phase I've been having

3249.44 --> 3256.119
a very tough time for months months this

3253.4 --> 3260.28
time in different forms and expressions

3256.119 --> 3263.76
it wasn't just One Singular way that was

3260.28 --> 3267.3190000000004
happening started out with like extreme

3263.76 --> 3270.2400000000002
over tension that's flopped to paranoia

3267.319 --> 3273.599
and heavy

3270.24 --> 3275.9599999999996
anxiety and then eventually like turn

3273.599 --> 3277.28
into like depression and just like low

3275.96 --> 3282.079
energy

3277.28 --> 3285.559
stuff and feeling like

3282.079 --> 3287.559
weak and i' I'm pretty much done with

3285.559 --> 3291.2400000000002
the cycle I

3287.559 --> 3292.96
feel it it's been a very miserable April

3291.24 --> 3295.1189999999997
really I mean i' I've tried to make

3292.96 --> 3298.04
something of it but it was low

3295.119 --> 3300.0
inspiration overall

3298.04 --> 3302.799
and I mean before that you were all

3300.0 --> 3306.2
there I mean I was like making titles

3302.799 --> 3307.7599999999998
for the The Tomorrow Show every time and

3306.2 --> 3311.359
had lots of

3307.76 --> 3314.599
inspiration right that's when it just

3311.359 --> 3317.319
finished that anxiety

3314.599 --> 3319.799
cycle when that part was done I had like

3317.319 --> 3322.079
lots of inspiration and then like it

3319.799 --> 3326.839
just yeah my internet got caught off and

3322.079 --> 3326.8390000000004
it was just completely [ __ ] me up

3328.48 --> 3333.64
right and I'm back to normal as is my

3331.0 --> 3336.28
internet I have

3333.64 --> 3339.0
internet I mean I did have internet but

3336.28 --> 3340.76
now it's actually fast internet and

3339.0 --> 3343.839
stable

3340.76 --> 3346.559
internet and now I could just like do

3343.839 --> 3348.839
five things at the same time again like

3346.559 --> 3352.6400000000003
oh I'll just open three

3348.839 --> 3356.0
videos watch Netflix watch Infowars

3352.64 --> 3359.4
watch Quantum of conscious video uh and

3356.0 --> 3361.2
have video game open and like that use

3359.4 --> 3362.52
the internet and everything like without

3361.2 --> 3367.2799999999997
any problem

3362.52 --> 3371.799
whatsoever so my setting is back to

3367.28 --> 3375.599
normal my situation tends to have a lot

3371.799 --> 3378.52
of impact on my

3375.599 --> 3381.079
mood so that that restored has certainly

3378.52 --> 3385.079
helped restore

3381.079 --> 3385.079
me yeah

3397.0 --> 3400.839
and

3398.599 --> 3403.92
trolls you

3400.839 --> 3407.88
really you hope the best for the

3403.92 --> 3411.28
trolls well technically yeah I mean they

3407.88 --> 3415.52
should just move on just move

3411.28 --> 3418.28
on yeah if I'm so delusional so terrible

3415.52 --> 3421.079
then why why are you

3418.28 --> 3424.6400000000003
here you you think that you're less

3421.079 --> 3424.6400000000003
delusional with what you

3425.96 --> 3434.039
do like to see a

3430.0 --> 3435.839
professional assessment of that like

3434.039 --> 3438.96
from a

3435.839 --> 3441.44
professional mental health specialist

3438.96 --> 3444.16
I'd like to hear their assessment about

3441.44 --> 3444.16
who's more

3444.28 --> 3450.88
delusional yeah

3447.359 --> 3454.5989999999997
maybe one day I'll even just do

3450.88 --> 3454.599
that that would be kind of

3454.76 --> 3460.96
funny right anyway yeah you're fine

3458.4 --> 3463.4
fiber outs don't worry about it you're

3460.96 --> 3466.48
just having a bit of a rough time I will

3463.4 --> 3468.079
apply the technique to you if if you're

3466.48 --> 3473.359
okay with

3468.079 --> 3473.3590000000004
that just tell me

3536.079 --> 3539.079
for

3577.359 --> 3579.64
my

3583.359 --> 3589.0789999999997
BRS can you give me some feedback please

3594.73 --> 3597.969
[Music]

3604.0 --> 3607.0
for

3616.54 --> 3619.69
[Applause]

3640.799 --> 3643.28
I'm really

3645.16 --> 3649.96
hungry yeah I'm actually going to take a

3647.319 --> 3653.44
bite out of this

3649.96 --> 3653.44
first so

3654.92 --> 3658.96
cheers for

3692.559 --> 3695.559
what

3737.64 --> 3740.64
okay

3774.839 --> 3778.799
spe for

3831.079 --> 3834.079
y

3840.48 --> 3843.599
right so sorry for

3845.359 --> 3848.92
that don't know if any of you could even

3847.72 --> 3852.799
hear

3848.92 --> 3857.44
that I didn't intend to I'd like to keep

3852.799 --> 3857.44
that stuff uh out of the stream

3859.68 --> 3864.96
really I know it in Dutch anyway so

3862.64 --> 3868.68
wouldn't be able to make out what I'm

3864.96 --> 3868.68
saying for

3874.95 --> 3879.35
[Applause]

3886.5 --> 3889.639
[Applause]

3903.52 --> 3908.799
right so

3905.079 --> 3908.799
yeah fire Roos

3910.559 --> 3915.96
apparently I yeah

3913.44 --> 3918.279
he's not in the chat anymore because he

3915.96 --> 3920.2400000000002
had some meeting so I think he was also

3918.279 --> 3922.599
just really nervous because of

3920.24 --> 3924.5589999999997
that right but I did apply the technique

3922.599 --> 3927.6400000000003
to him just now so he should feel a

3924.559 --> 3927.6400000000003
little better

3930.559 --> 3933.559
figure out how things

3933.68 --> 3938.3999999999996
went right

3936.119 --> 3943.279
anyway everybody please don't forget to

3938.4 --> 3943.279
rogans up the show and share it

3963.68 --> 3966.68
y

3998.319 --> 4005.599
oh looks like over

4001.079 --> 4007.48
at Nathan Oakley there that's fing weird

4005.599 --> 4010.799
what's going on

4007.48 --> 4010.799
here what

4012.52 --> 4020.319
the some weird inter face stuff

4017.839 --> 4023.44
happening they're

4020.319 --> 4028.359
uh they're reviewing a professor Dave

4023.44 --> 4034.76
video where he is addressing Eric

4028.359 --> 4034.7599999999998
D's 200 proofs so that should be very

4035.599 --> 4039.039
convoluted oh

4043.319 --> 4047.52
God this is a whole lot of nothing

4048.039 --> 4053.92
uh [ __ ] off then

4051.44 --> 4057.96
[ __ ] yeah you got a

4053.92 --> 4057.96
question you want to talk about

4059.2 --> 4069.799
something then bring it up H maybe ask a

4063.599 --> 4069.799
question or maybe not maybe whatever

4094.559 --> 4097.559
h

4111.12 --> 4114.12
a

4151.52 --> 4159.2390000000005
all right so yeah Earth is

4155.719 --> 4159.2390000000005
flat there's no

4160.159 --> 4165.92
curvature Globe Earth model like the

4163.799 --> 4169.2789999999995
actual model of Earth and

4165.92 --> 4172.92
coordinate system and latitudes it's all

4169.279 --> 4176.2390000000005
based of taking an angle off a flat

4172.92 --> 4178.2390000000005
plane to a

4176.239 --> 4181.0
star

4178.239 --> 4183.4
H yeah that's right the globe Earth

4181.0 --> 4185.48
model whatever that's supposed to be

4183.4 --> 4186.4
right it's not really a model it's just

4185.48 --> 4190.199
an

4186.4 --> 4193.239
idea an idea based on fraud and

4190.199 --> 4195.4
presuppositions that are

4193.239 --> 4199.199
disproven yeah it's all based off of

4195.4 --> 4202.599999999999
flat plane cuz the Earth is

4199.199 --> 4205.799999999999
flat and uh you wouldn't be able to do

4202.6 --> 4208.719
Celestial navigation on the oceans

4205.8 --> 4210.12
without it because you can't use a theot

4208.719 --> 4212.92
light on the

4210.12 --> 4214.92
ocean yeah cuz your ship's going to be

4212.92 --> 4217.4400000000005
moving around because the ocean will

4214.92 --> 4218.92
rock the boat you won't be able to

4217.44 --> 4221.96
establish

4218.92 --> 4225.36
Plum that only works on

4221.96 --> 4226.159
land yet Celestial navigation has been

4225.36 --> 4229.32
been

4226.159 --> 4232.04
used even in the Renaissance on the

4229.32 --> 4235.199
ocean yeah

4232.04 --> 4238.4
why because the Earth is flat and that

4235.199 --> 4241.28
made it possible to do

4238.4 --> 4243.08
that yeah if the Earth was a globe we

4241.28 --> 4245.88
wouldn't be able to do Celestial

4243.08 --> 4249.32
navigation on the ocean at

4245.88 --> 4249.32
all it wouldn't

4250.12 --> 4254.12
work yeah

4257.04 --> 4262.239
bees more bees there's a lot of bees

4259.8 --> 4262.2390000000005
coming in

4267.4 --> 4270.719
here dumb

4280.84 --> 4285.1990000000005
ass [ __ ] sake

4305.6 --> 4309.6
yeah so Earth is

4309.76 --> 4315.84
flat angles to Polaris over a flat

4314.04 --> 4319.96
plane yeah

4315.84 --> 4321.4400000000005
and the entire cosmology of outer space

4319.96 --> 4325.8
is based

4321.44 --> 4327.879999999999
on hens hugin as they say in England

4325.8 --> 4330.400000000001
because they can't pronounce Dutch names

4327.88 --> 4332.639
ever not even to save their own

4330.4 --> 4335.679
lives so

4332.639 --> 4338.639
eugen's assumption that Venus is the

4335.679 --> 4342.719
same size a planet as the presupposed

4338.639 --> 4342.719
sphere Earth planet

4349.28 --> 4355.239
yeah and based on that assumption uh the

4352.239 --> 4357.44
scales are set in of all the plan the

4355.239 --> 4358.638999999999
assumed to be planetary bodies and even

4357.44 --> 4361.48
the moon and

4358.639 --> 4364.32
everything and the distance to the

4361.48 --> 4366.599999999999
Sun based on the assumption that Venus

4364.32 --> 4369.759999999999
is the same size as presupposed

4366.6 --> 4372.08
spherical Earth and thereby setting the

4369.76 --> 4375.08
standard for angular size versus

4372.08 --> 4375.08
distance

4377.96 --> 4383.719
and thereby creating a depth to the

4381.639 --> 4387.04
celestial

4383.719 --> 4390.36
mappings instead of well the reality of

4387.04 --> 4391.92
it which is there's a bunch of lights in

4390.36 --> 4394.679
the

4391.92 --> 4397.88
sky they are

4394.679 --> 4401.76
manifested in at an

4397.88 --> 4401.76
angle that's angles are

4401.88 --> 4407.159000000001
consistent and there is no actual

4404.52 --> 4409.4800000000005
distance that can be proven there's no

4407.159 --> 4413.159
actual distance to any of the celestial

4409.48 --> 4415.199
bodies that anybody can prove can prove

4413.159 --> 4418.599999999999
an exact location of any of the

4415.199 --> 4422.44
celestial bodies including the

4418.6 --> 4427.88
Moon Yeah cuz they don't appear to

4422.44 --> 4430.5199999999995
behave like objects would CU an

4427.88 --> 4432.84
object you know that's provably an

4430.52 --> 4435.52
object in the world well perspective

4432.84 --> 4438.12
applies to that and so if if you

4435.52 --> 4441.4800000000005
approach an object then to you as an

4438.12 --> 4443.96
observer of that object the angular size

4441.48 --> 4447.32
of the object will

4443.96 --> 4452.0
increase it will start to look bigger

4447.32 --> 4455.44
it'll take up more angle space in your

4452.0 --> 4458.32
view yet none of that ever happens with

4455.44 --> 4462.44
any of the celestial bodies under any

4458.32 --> 4467.5199999999995
condition so there's only angular data

4462.44 --> 4467.5199999999995
about any of them leading me to

4469.719 --> 4474.199
basically

4471.48 --> 4476.839999999999
conclude that the celestial lights are

4474.199 --> 4479.4
non-local holographic angular

4476.84 --> 4481.92
manifestations and not objects at any

4479.4 --> 4481.92
position

4485.92 --> 4493.56
anywhere does Polaris work for people in

4489.159 --> 4493.5599999999995
the South uh

4495.159 --> 4502.4
well Polaris is not the only star you

4497.84 --> 4505.88
can do it with it's just the base star

4502.4 --> 4508.799999999999
it's the one that doesn't

4505.88 --> 4511.88
shift yeah or shifts the least in the

4508.8 --> 4513.84
sky that rotates all celestial bodies do

4511.88 --> 4516.1990000000005
like rotate around the apparent axis of

4513.84 --> 4518.52
it and Polaris is at the center of that

4516.199 --> 4519.759999999999
and so it's the most reliable point in

4518.52 --> 4522.52
the

4519.76 --> 4524.2390000000005
sky north of the equator and slightly

4522.52 --> 4525.679
south of the Equator as well I mean you

4524.239 --> 4527.599999999999
could still see it's slightly south of

4525.679 --> 4529.04
the Equator don't know how that's

4527.6 --> 4531.719
supposed to work on a presupposed

4529.04 --> 4535.04
spherical Earth but you

4531.719 --> 4536.96
can and then everything

4535.04 --> 4541.12
else

4536.96 --> 4543.76
basically is adapted to that so even the

4541.12 --> 4544.639
southern hemisphere supposedly south of

4543.76 --> 4547.6
the

4544.639 --> 4550.52
Equator you still have all the angular

4547.6 --> 4551.8
data of all the other stars and how they

4550.52 --> 4555.159000000001
relate to

4551.8 --> 4558.320000000001
Polaris and so the rest is mapped around

4555.159 --> 4561.12
that even though you don't literally see

4558.32 --> 4563.84
Polaris you will still be able to map it

4561.12 --> 4563.84
out

4564.199 --> 4569.159
consistently based on originally the

4567.159 --> 4571.199
angular position of Polaris in relation

4569.159 --> 4578.92
to the position of the Earth on the

4571.199 --> 4581.96
earth and so yeah you don't directly use

4578.92 --> 4585.92
Polaris south of the

4581.96 --> 4589.04
Equator but the way that the celestial

4585.92 --> 4592.88
map and Celestial navigation systems

4589.04 --> 4598.6
have the maps how they have been created

4592.88 --> 4601.8
is anchored resting upon the angular

4598.6 --> 4605.1990000000005
consistency of Polaris over the Earth

4601.8 --> 4605.1990000000005
that's how the map has been

4606.639 --> 4610.639
made right

4642.84 --> 4645.84
m

4646.639 --> 4652.88
I can't believe I'm still doing this oh

4649.4 --> 4655.679
telling you how the Earth is

4652.88 --> 4658.28
measured and navigated flat and how you

4655.679 --> 4661.719
don't have a globe

4658.28 --> 4664.5199999999995
model without using the Flat

4661.719 --> 4667.719
Earth as a foundation for the creation

4664.52 --> 4673.4400000000005
of your Globe Model

4667.719 --> 4675.8
A yeah yeah I'm still sharing this very

4673.44 --> 4678.199
Inconvenient Truth with you you

4675.8 --> 4682.2390000000005
balard that's right I'm

4678.199 --> 4686.4
still telling you the

4682.239 --> 4686.4
truth about how your belief

4702.719 --> 4709.159
works yeah that's right yeah yeah I'm

4705.52 --> 4712.639
that's right I'm eating I'm eating cuz

4709.159 --> 4716.638999999999
it's my [ __ ] show and if I want to

4712.639 --> 4718.400000000001
eat on camera on my show I will [ __ ]

4716.639 --> 4720.76
do so and there's not a [ __ ] thing

4718.4 --> 4723.44
you can do about hereby

4720.76 --> 4726.12
scumbags yeah I will keep doing it I've

4723.44 --> 4729.239
been doing it for a [ __ ] decade and I

4726.12 --> 4732.239
will do it for another [ __ ]

4729.239 --> 4732.239
decade

4733.32 --> 4736.719
yeah get over

4745.4 --> 4751.12
it where did you do I don't leave any

4748.12 --> 4753.12
life suggestion from a bunch of [ __ ]

4751.12 --> 4756.0
trolls who have no [ __ ]

4753.12 --> 4759.12
life

4756.0 --> 4761.04
H all your fake

4759.12 --> 4765.04
identities

4761.04 --> 4769.4
caricatures I mean you're literally

4765.04 --> 4770.92
like a looney bin of characters at this

4769.4 --> 4775.599999999999
point

4770.92 --> 4778.639
no like severe multiple personality

4775.6 --> 4783.84
syndrome how many people did you have to

4778.639 --> 4788.08
make up just to accommodate for your

4783.84 --> 4792.6
horrendous social trolling habits

4788.08 --> 4792.6
huh sick [ __ ]

4817.0 --> 4820.32
yeah for those wondering like what the

4818.52 --> 4824.679
hell is Arwin talking about I don't know

4820.32 --> 4824.679
what he's talking about yeah that's like

4825.04 --> 4829.8
I had to ban like

4827.04 --> 4832.239
another five trolls in the last 10

4829.8 --> 4832.2390000000005
minutes

4833.76 --> 4839.0
so it's kind of hard to keep track who's

4836.48 --> 4841.44
actually just not a

4839.0 --> 4843.84
troll because they keep getting snowed

4841.44 --> 4846.239
under troll comments that I have to

4843.84 --> 4849.4400000000005
remove so yeah afterward you won't

4846.239 --> 4852.599999999999
really see it you might only notice that

4849.44 --> 4856.5599999999995
there's stuff going on by the the

4852.6 --> 4860.88
chat on camera right there like bumping

4856.56 --> 4860.88
up and then getting clunked

4864.76 --> 4869.159000000001
down cuz afterwards there will be no

4867.239 --> 4871.879999999999
trace of the trolls except for me

4869.159 --> 4871.879999999999
bringing it up

4875.36 --> 4882.199
unfortunately but

4877.44 --> 4882.199
yeah I have to deal with it

4888.719 --> 4895.44
Earth is

4890.639 --> 4898.32
navigated measured and calculated flat

4895.44 --> 4903.5199999999995
Globe model is designed

4898.32 --> 4906.759999999999
based angles to Polaris of a flat

4903.52 --> 4908.96
plane that is then presupposed

4906.76 --> 4912.1990000000005
mathematically

4908.96 --> 4915.44
bent that's how it works hey G good to

4912.199 --> 4915.44
see you

4942.3 --> 4947.4800000000005
[Applause]

4943.52 --> 4947.4800000000005
yeah for

4982.239 --> 4987.12
so let's just put that in the title why

4989.4 --> 4992.4
not

4995.04 --> 4999.639
a [ __ ] you then

5014.56 --> 5017.56
TR

5015.52 --> 5020.159000000001
rt57 I don't know what the hell you're

5017.56 --> 5020.159000000001
talking about

5031.4 --> 5035.759999999999
Moxy they still think they're using

5033.8 --> 5040.1990000000005
spherical math yeah they're using

5035.76 --> 5042.679
spherical math from within hell I mean

5040.199 --> 5044.879999999999
it's the angle from

5042.679 --> 5050.52
hell right I

5044.88 --> 5053.32
mean you got to be a a like a willing

5050.52 --> 5055.2390000000005
[ __ ] to actually believe that you're

5053.32 --> 5058.0
doing Celestial navigation on the globe

5055.239 --> 5061.48
when even like the diagrams that are

5058.0 --> 5065.6
used show you an angle from

5061.48 --> 5070.0
hell like from inside of the globe Earth

5065.6 --> 5070.0
supposedly it's absolutely

5076.36 --> 5082.759999999999
Preposterous the little I who the [ __ ]

5079.679 --> 5082.76
are you talking about

5089.239 --> 5096.239
Moxy

5091.639 --> 5096.2390000000005
oh that uh

5099.04 --> 5104.84
right whatever you keep your eye on him

5102.52 --> 5109.1990000000005
like I don't I just I just kick him out

5104.84 --> 5112.96
everywhere but I mean it's not just him

5109.199 --> 5114.96
though it's him and like at least one

5112.96 --> 5117.28
other two other

5114.96 --> 5120.56
guys that are doing all this it's not

5117.28 --> 5120.5599999999995
just him

5134.119 --> 5139.599999999999
everyone who does

5136.4 --> 5141.759999999999
cesan it's not just some of them all of

5139.6 --> 5146.320000000001
them think

5141.76 --> 5146.320000000001
that well in the current times

5150.48 --> 5156.04
perhaps but it's only because of the new

5153.679 --> 5159.119
manual of celestial navigation that

5156.04 --> 5161.679
basically make you do angles from hell I

5159.119 --> 5163.28
mean it's right there in plain sight

5161.679 --> 5166.56
they show you

5163.28 --> 5169.5199999999995
globe and then show you taking an angle

5166.56 --> 5169.52
from inside the

5170.96 --> 5176.84
globe and hey if you're just not picking

5174.48 --> 5178.919999999999
up on that then that's your fault then

5176.84 --> 5180.400000000001
you are reinforced that you're actually

5178.92 --> 5182.4
doing it on the globe even though you

5180.4 --> 5185.04
should realize that's not on the globe

5182.4 --> 5187.32
that's inside of the globe and if you're

5185.04 --> 5189.04
not smart enough to pick up on that then

5187.32 --> 5193.36
yeah I

5189.04 --> 5193.36
mean they weren't dishonest with

5209.8 --> 5216.2390000000005
you some kind of that Moxy that's been

5212.84 --> 5216.2390000000005
playing for months

5227.92 --> 5234.4
and yes it is pathetic it's very

5230.719 --> 5234.4
seriously pathetic

5255.239 --> 5261.839999999999
how do we get them to see that they're

5257.48 --> 5261.839999999999
measuring the Flat Earth though

5263.159 --> 5268.96
well by just telling them how they are

5265.92 --> 5271.56
measuring the flat earth like what I've

5268.96 --> 5275.44
described and then it's up to them to

5271.56 --> 5278.6
actually be open-minded enough to

5275.44 --> 5280.48
listen right problem is not that people

5278.6 --> 5283.8
don't get the right information the

5280.48 --> 5283.799999999999
problem is is that they don't

5287.199 --> 5291.5599999999995
listen problem is that people are

5290.28 --> 5295.639
conditioned

5291.56 --> 5299.0
about accepting certain things as is as

5295.639 --> 5302.88
is told to them before they understand

5299.0 --> 5305.32
it you get told how things are

5302.88 --> 5308.28
before before before you actually manage

5305.32 --> 5308.28
to understand

5309.92 --> 5315.28
how and when you live like that you're

5313.119 --> 5318.5599999999995
going to have a lot of

5315.28 --> 5321.119
trouble when you realize that the

5318.56 --> 5324.4400000000005
preconceived notion that you were given

5321.119 --> 5327.48
about something was

5324.44 --> 5330.638999999999
wrong because you've been taught to just

5327.48 --> 5335.28
blindly trust that that

5330.639 --> 5336.28
notion and disregard inconsistencies

5335.28 --> 5338.639
of the

5336.28 --> 5341.639
information or the data that you

5338.639 --> 5344.2390000000005
attained in regards to those assumptions

5341.639 --> 5348.0
that were given to you people have a lot

5344.239 --> 5348.0
of trouble with that

5352.81 --> 5355.929
[Music]

5368.4 --> 5373.96
right and I mean getting people on board

5370.88 --> 5376.32
with Fe Frank I mean I don't know I

5373.96 --> 5379.56
don't understand what you think that is

5376.32 --> 5379.5599999999995
going to be achieved by

5385.4 --> 5390.92
that I mean I like the idea like from 10

5389.44 --> 5392.759999999999
years ago like oh we're going to just

5390.92 --> 5394.719
spread the information everybody figures

5392.76 --> 5397.400000000001
out the Earth is flat

5394.719 --> 5397.4
yeah well what

5397.88 --> 5402.92
about if people figure out it's flat but

5400.84 --> 5405.6
then realize that they're never going to

5402.92 --> 5409.0
win that fight and it's always going to

5405.6 --> 5410.280000000001
be claimed to be a ball by government

5409.0 --> 5414.76
and

5410.28 --> 5417.199
mainstream and media

5414.76 --> 5419.679
organizations and schools and

5417.199 --> 5421.799999999999
universities boards and all that and

5419.679 --> 5424.8
they're just going to keep it a ball

5421.8 --> 5427.0
even if like it's completely thoroughly

5424.8 --> 5429.320000000001
proven that the Earth is flat and that

5427.0 --> 5430.88
the entire Globe model is based off a

5429.32 --> 5434.759999999999
flat plane

5430.88 --> 5437.28
measurement yeah and all of that like

5434.76 --> 5440.4800000000005
people figure out that it doesn't

5437.28 --> 5443.679
matter like and they get frustrate it's

5440.48 --> 5446.119
like yeah but if we figure out the truth

5443.679 --> 5450.08
then it must all change

5446.119 --> 5453.679
around no no it

5450.08 --> 5456.88
doesn't yeah how many things out there

5453.679 --> 5460.28
are completely wrong and everybody knows

5456.88 --> 5462.32
it wrong how many times does that public

5460.28 --> 5465.5199999999995
knowledge of something being completely

5462.32 --> 5470.4
wrong at at this point in time actually

5465.52 --> 5473.92
change it yeah yeah it

5470.4 --> 5476.239
doesn't just knowing something is wrong

5473.92 --> 5480.4400000000005
doesn't change

5476.239 --> 5484.48
it it just gives you a

5480.44 --> 5488.638999999999
choice are you going to be a sheep de

5484.48 --> 5490.959999999999
and delusional and just Echo the lie and

5488.639 --> 5492.719
forget about the truth or are you going

5490.96 --> 5496.52
to brace

5492.719 --> 5501.52
yourself against a satanic system that

5496.52 --> 5505.080000000001
like perpetually lies and

5501.52 --> 5510.080000000001
calculates on people believing lies and

5505.08 --> 5510.08
it has done that like for centuries

5510.96 --> 5518.639
forever right you have to deal with it

5514.44 --> 5521.32
and that's the entire issue with all

5518.639 --> 5527.08
conspiracy theories all of

5521.32 --> 5529.44
it not just flat earth right all of it

5527.08 --> 5531.6
it's like yeah you can figure out all

5529.44 --> 5533.599999999999
these things you can see all these

5531.6 --> 5537.52
malevolent

5533.6 --> 5542.119000000001
actors and how they lie and deceive and

5537.52 --> 5544.4400000000005
steal and get people killed yeah is it

5542.119 --> 5546.32
changing anything oh you spread it

5544.44 --> 5550.5599999999995
around did you oh did that change

5546.32 --> 5551.92
anything did it no cuz it's not about

5550.56 --> 5556.159000000001
changing it

5551.92 --> 5558.1990000000005
anymore it's about knowing what is true

5556.159 --> 5560.5199999999995
not falling for

5558.199 --> 5563.28
it what

5560.52 --> 5567.1990000000005
the like not participating because a lot

5563.28 --> 5569.759999999999
of these scams these days are

5567.199 --> 5573.879999999999
partition participation

5569.76 --> 5576.4400000000005
based like they require you to buy in

5573.88 --> 5578.6
into it yeah like the medical

5576.44 --> 5583.28
experimentation you have to be the one

5578.6 --> 5587.4400000000005
that says I want to take it for whatever

5583.28 --> 5591.119
reason like to get a job or to go to a

5587.44 --> 5593.08
party whatever be part of something well

5591.119 --> 5596.5199999999995
it's your choice we're not being forced

5593.08 --> 5597.88
not really you might lose stuff even

5596.52 --> 5600.84
your job if you

5597.88 --> 5605.0
didn't but nobody could actually be made

5600.84 --> 5605.0
to do it for real

5606.04 --> 5612.719
so it's all voluntary participation

5610.0 --> 5615.84
based that's how this world now

5612.719 --> 5617.2390000000005
works that's the new balance between the

5615.84 --> 5619.8
light and the

5617.239 --> 5624.04
Darkness and people need to become aware

5619.8 --> 5626.96
of that is that you can't change this

5624.04 --> 5629.76
devil that basically just threw off

5626.96 --> 5632.199
their clothes and is completely exposed

5629.76 --> 5635.1990000000005
to those who have the mind and the eyes

5632.199 --> 5639.879999999999
to see that it is the

5635.199 --> 5642.599999999999
devil you can't get rid of it yeah I

5639.88 --> 5645.119
want to I want to I'm kind of desperate

5642.6 --> 5648.2390000000005
too but I mean you just can't it's not

5645.119 --> 5649.759999999999
going to go away but it can't do

5648.239 --> 5652.638999999999
anything to you

5649.76 --> 5655.84
either if you don't let it and if you

5652.639 --> 5657.76
just know what is real take that burden

5655.84 --> 5660.119000000001
and don't fall for the

5657.76 --> 5663.04
scams and then you're okay then you can

5660.119 --> 5665.96
survive this period I mean that devil

5663.04 --> 5669.639
there that is now out of out in the open

5665.96 --> 5672.04
out of the closet and in control is not

5669.639 --> 5673.719
going to last forever there's no way I

5672.04 --> 5676.76
mean they might last a while but they

5673.719 --> 5679.52
cannot last forever so all you basically

5676.76 --> 5684.400000000001
have to do is survive this

5679.52 --> 5688.52
time by knowing what is what what is

5684.4 --> 5689.879999999999
real and not get caught up in any scams

5688.52 --> 5693.360000000001
of the devil

5689.88 --> 5697.8
basically right and that's that's really

5693.36 --> 5697.799999999999
the thing that's important right now for

5701.96 --> 5708.0
everybody right and the same goes with

5706.04 --> 5710.84
flat Earth I mean there's a lot of

5708.0 --> 5712.88
people that have become aware that

5710.84 --> 5714.2390000000005
there's a lot of scam surrounding like

5712.88 --> 5716.52
the

5714.239 --> 5719.799999999999
globe at

5716.52 --> 5723.76
Nasa and it's all shady

5719.8 --> 5725.28
like moon landing skepticism is at a

5723.76 --> 5729.6
record

5725.28 --> 5731.719
high records giant records and the

5729.6 --> 5734.2390000000005
people make up their own alternative

5731.719 --> 5737.84
theories like oh they they did it in

5734.239 --> 5740.04
secret or they couldn't do it or they

5737.84 --> 5742.159000000001
couldn't film it and they just had to

5740.04 --> 5745.04
put down this act and then they just

5742.159 --> 5747.159
went with the act because all kinds of

5745.04 --> 5749.6
reasons all kinds of excuses or like oh

5747.159 --> 5752.36
they bumped into aliens so they couldn't

5749.6 --> 5753.96
they couldn't show anything whatever

5752.36 --> 5756.599999999999
they're going to make excuses they have

5753.96 --> 5757.719
been making excuses ever since they made

5756.6 --> 5760.4400000000005
the supposed

5757.719 --> 5763.44
moonlanding

5760.44 --> 5763.44
trickery

5764.199 --> 5769.48
right

5766.04 --> 5772.08
and just knowing that the Earth is flat

5769.48 --> 5774.119
it won't

5772.08 --> 5778.32
change that

5774.119 --> 5781.839999999999
media and movies and schools are still

5778.32 --> 5783.119
going to teach that the Earth is a globe

5781.84 --> 5785.04
it's not going to change that and that's

5783.119 --> 5788.04
very frustrating for a lot of people

5785.04 --> 5790.84
because a lot of people naturally when

5788.04 --> 5793.679
you figure out wait this is fake then

5790.84 --> 5796.159000000001
you're going to naturally demand that

5793.679 --> 5797.28
the entire world adapts to your new

5796.159 --> 5801.199
found

5797.28 --> 5804.04
knowledge guess what it

5801.199 --> 5806.839999999999
doesn't

5804.04 --> 5809.84
yeah and now you're in a conflict with

5806.84 --> 5811.76
the world with the spirit of the world

5809.84 --> 5814.28
that's when you become marked as a

5811.76 --> 5816.2390000000005
conspiracy theorist

5814.28 --> 5818.239
the thing you didn't want to be because

5816.239 --> 5822.959999999999
it isolates

5818.239 --> 5825.599999999999
you yeah well you don't have a

5822.96 --> 5828.84
choice or you can choose to lose your

5825.6 --> 5834.159000000001
mind and risk

5828.84 --> 5837.96
death and severe health detriments and

5834.159 --> 5840.32
humiliation that can never be rectified

5837.96 --> 5841.119
ever things that you will end up doing

5840.32 --> 5843.96
to

5841.119 --> 5846.799999999999
yourself that you can never ever ever

5843.96 --> 5849.4800000000005
fix and justify afterward and that

5846.8 --> 5851.6
nobody will have sympathy for you

5849.48 --> 5854.759999999999
because you were willingly

5851.6 --> 5856.76
ignorant go along to get along at any

5854.76 --> 5859.88
price and that price was very is going

5856.76 --> 5863.360000000001
to be very heavy and the further we go

5859.88 --> 5864.4800000000005
down the line the heavier that price is

5863.36 --> 5867.48
going to

5864.48 --> 5871.08
be if you refuse to wake up and put

5867.48 --> 5874.36
yourself in that opposition to the

5871.08 --> 5878.48
devil then you're going to have a real

5874.36 --> 5881.92
serious problem and that problem will

5878.48 --> 5884.799999999999
accumulate to fatal

5881.92 --> 5887.4
proportions it's not a like oh it's a

5884.8 --> 5888.92
it's a chance no that's like guaranteed

5887.4 --> 5891.5599999999995
fatal proportions that's where it's

5888.92 --> 5893.4
going to go yeah this is the sleepers

5891.56 --> 5895.2390000000005
and the awaken this is the time of that

5893.4 --> 5897.638999999999
polarization between the sleepers and

5895.239 --> 5900.718999999999
the awaken I talked about this 7even

5897.639 --> 5903.56
years ago on my channel and it's really

5900.719 --> 5907.76
now at a latter stage it's really in

5903.56 --> 5909.92
tense now and there are tons of people

5907.76 --> 5912.8
that know a lot about how things are

5909.92 --> 5915.28
fake including like the globe Earth they

5912.8 --> 5918.119000000001
know it's fake it's just

5915.28 --> 5920.96
that they they can't deal with it it's

5918.119 --> 5923.48
like they don't want to bicker they

5920.96 --> 5926.119
don't want to bump into people's Globe

5923.48 --> 5929.4
conditioning and then have them get

5926.119 --> 5932.28
triggered because you you said what you

5929.4 --> 5934.879999999999
know they don't want to deal with

5932.28 --> 5937.48
it yeah sometimes I don't want to deal

5934.88 --> 5940.08
with it but I have a show this is one of

5937.48 --> 5942.5599999999995
the things that I do I have to deal with

5940.08 --> 5944.719
it I'm a flat earther I'm an open flat

5942.56 --> 5948.96
earther on YouTube and I have to deal

5944.719 --> 5952.639
with it despite like

5948.96 --> 5956.44
deranged maniacs and cyber

5952.639 --> 5959.1990000000005
stalkers continually trying to roll out

5956.44 --> 5961.159
every damn thing they could think of

5959.199 --> 5963.0
that involves my life or things that

5961.159 --> 5967.32
I've talked about that try to shame me

5963.0 --> 5969.119
or burden others intimidate others

5967.32 --> 5972.32
wherever I go so that it's just

5969.119 --> 5974.28
Associated that if I if I appear

5972.32 --> 5977.44
somewhere then they're going to have

5974.28 --> 5980.119
those trolls and then maybe if they just

5977.44 --> 5982.0
get rid of me then they don't have to

5980.119 --> 5984.28
deal with those trolls yeah that's their

5982.0 --> 5986.0
tactic that's how they're literally

5984.28 --> 5989.36
trying to ruin my

5986.0 --> 5992.679
life and only people that realize how

5989.36 --> 5994.719
[ __ ] up that is of these trolls will

5992.679 --> 5997.679
sympathize with me and actually side

5994.719 --> 6000.88
with me and just help me get rid of

5997.679 --> 6003.92
them and people that are

6000.88 --> 6006.4800000000005
weak and they won't and they'll say like

6003.92 --> 6009.719
I'm sorry we we don't want you here

6006.48 --> 6011.718999999999
because yeah these trolls are just we

6009.719 --> 6013.4800000000005
don't want to deal with it yeah and

6011.719 --> 6016.36
that's a lot of people a lot of people

6013.48 --> 6016.36
do want to deal with

6020.719 --> 6027.679
it that's why we need more no

6024.36 --> 6030.719
Frank it's not going to do

6027.679 --> 6033.32
anything we could have every single

6030.719 --> 6038.159
[ __ ] teacher and

6033.32 --> 6041.36
academic like sign contracts with

6038.159 --> 6042.96
vows and everything like the Earth is

6041.36 --> 6046.839999999999
flat we're going to teach it we are

6042.96 --> 6050.84
going to oppose the Glo it won't matter

6046.84 --> 6054.32
Frank don't you get it it won't matter

6050.84 --> 6057.84
the media is still going to roll out

6054.32 --> 6061.32
Globe yeah movies are still going to

6057.84 --> 6064.56
roll out Globe the news is still going

6061.32 --> 6067.599
to roll out Globe it doesn't matter if

6064.56 --> 6071.8
all the teachers are suddenly flat

6067.599 --> 6074.599
earthers officially it it won't matter

6071.8 --> 6074.599
don't you

6077.4 --> 6084.0
understand it's like already accepted no

6080.119 --> 6087.239
I know how this works it this stuff dude

6084.0 --> 6090.8
I've been part of this scene for eight

6087.239 --> 6094.32
years Frank eight years okay how long

6090.8 --> 6098.599
have you I've been doing this for eight

6094.32 --> 6100.92
years I know how this works yeah it's

6098.599 --> 6105.2390000000005
not going to

6100.92 --> 6108.1990000000005
happen yeah there is way more acute

6105.239 --> 6111.28
situations happening people are not

6108.199 --> 6114.5599999999995
going to get on board with this they're

6111.28 --> 6117.08
happy that they can be barely survive in

6114.56 --> 6120.400000000001
this world especially teachers you know

6117.08 --> 6123.28
how tough they have it now the teachers

6120.4 --> 6125.44
teaching is always been a tough job now

6123.28 --> 6128.08
it's out of

6125.44 --> 6131.678999999999
control it's so

6128.08 --> 6135.4
heavy they're not going to like Rebel

6131.679 --> 6135.4
like that

6138.08 --> 6145.159
yeah doesn't work like

6142.0 --> 6145.159
that yeah

6147.4 --> 6152.199
like we're in the middle of like a

6149.28 --> 6152.199
replacement

6152.44 --> 6158.5599999999995
migration preamble to Civil War in the

6155.639 --> 6162.159000000001
west like it's not going to happen

6158.56 --> 6162.159000000001
mate deal with

6164.639 --> 6167.639
it

6168.36 --> 6174.199
yeah like take down the trotskyite

6171.4 --> 6178.759999999999
bankers and conspirators for politicians

6174.199 --> 6183.04
corporate people that are creating this

6178.76 --> 6185.52
policy and then maybe at some point then

6183.04 --> 6189.28
when things kind of restore again power

6185.52 --> 6192.360000000001
becomes affordable again crazy Overkill

6189.28 --> 6195.5199999999995
environmental policies get negated

6192.36 --> 6197.759999999999
business gets back to normal well then

6195.52 --> 6202.84
and only

6197.76 --> 6204.84
then might we perhaps like hey maybe we

6202.84 --> 6207.76
could like

6204.84 --> 6210.679
like reinvigorate the Flat Earth debate

6207.76 --> 6212.639
now that people have some breathing room

6210.679 --> 6216.36
again

6212.639 --> 6220.08
yeah only then it's not going to happen

6216.36 --> 6220.08
right now don't you

6222.28 --> 6226.84
understand yeah we're in the middle of a

6227.0 --> 6233.28
Siege you don't

6230.199 --> 6235.32
initiate intellectual

6233.28 --> 6240.32
information

6235.32 --> 6240.32
revolutions in the middle of a

6243.199 --> 6246.638999999999
Siege it's

6256.84 --> 6261.400000000001
insane fight them on the beaches fight

6259.52 --> 6263.360000000001
yeah but that was not in the middle of a

6261.4 --> 6266.598999999999
Siege Moxy

6263.36 --> 6271.159
that's a a relatively free

6266.599 --> 6276.4800000000005
nation that has the ability to do those

6271.159 --> 6279.36
things yeah people need the room they

6276.48 --> 6281.879999999999
need breathing room for an intellectual

6279.36 --> 6285.239
Revolution yeah they

6281.88 --> 6288.36
need they want a revolution to get some

6285.239 --> 6290.759999999999
breath back to get some finances back to

6288.36 --> 6292.5199999999995
be able to just afford food again yeah

6290.76 --> 6294.8
that's the revolution that people are

6292.52 --> 6298.84
waiting for for now because we're in a

6294.8 --> 6300.4800000000005
Siege yeah they don't give a [ __ ] about

6298.84 --> 6303.04
whether the Earth is flat or a globe

6300.48 --> 6308.718999999999
it's completely irrelevant to their

6303.04 --> 6308.719
acute needs in this period of

6309.52 --> 6312.52
Siege

6316.0 --> 6320.04
yeah and there's been so much

6318.599 --> 6323.52
information

6320.04 --> 6326.199
spread during this period of siege that

6323.52 --> 6329.719
who knows like once The Siege

6326.199 --> 6332.239
ends in the west then who knows where

6329.719 --> 6334.96
things will go there's been so much

6332.239 --> 6339.919999999999
information spread out like beside Flat

6334.96 --> 6343.719
Earth even so much like unbelievable

6339.92 --> 6347.4400000000005
amounts okay the medical knowledge

6343.719 --> 6350.4800000000005
Revolution that has happened is

6347.44 --> 6352.719
staggering and I'm a part of it in in an

6350.48 --> 6358.04
indirect sense because I talk about it

6352.719 --> 6361.119
too it's like yeah it really was I I I

6358.04 --> 6362.88
was kind of modest at the start but it

6361.119 --> 6367.0
really does turn out that like the

6362.88 --> 6368.76
entire medical system the entirety of it

6367.0 --> 6371.679
that kind of booted up in the 20 early

6368.76 --> 6376.76
20th century it's

6371.679 --> 6380.76
all it's all a Eugenics based

6376.76 --> 6386.4800000000005
scam all of it like the allopathic

6380.76 --> 6389.360000000001
medical system and all these supposed

6386.48 --> 6391.839999999999
Services it's mostly a scam and it's

6389.36 --> 6394.92
really just the acute surgery and all

6391.84 --> 6398.84
that that still has an important

6394.92 --> 6401.56
function right there are operations

6398.84 --> 6405.2390000000005
that are very

6401.56 --> 6405.2390000000005
effective restoring

6405.88 --> 6411.639
damage right there's good procedures but

6408.679 --> 6414.8
I mean the overall health

6411.639 --> 6418.159000000001
care that is not the same thing right as

6414.8 --> 6421.8
acute surgery like accidents or whatever

6418.159 --> 6425.32
mishaps repairing people but the rest of

6421.8 --> 6426.719
it the Health Care System that's also

6425.32 --> 6429.96
part of it

6426.719 --> 6433.599
is totally destructive it was never

6429.96 --> 6437.639
super good it's horrendous now it is

6433.599 --> 6439.639
like a death system now very bad for

6437.639 --> 6443.2390000000005
everybody like they're not helping

6439.639 --> 6445.679
anybody and the whole Universal policy

6443.239 --> 6449.119
is to not really help

6445.679 --> 6453.119
people help them stop complaining and

6449.119 --> 6455.5199999999995
not don't really care for the long-term

6453.119 --> 6457.32
consequences yeah and when things get so

6455.52 --> 6459.96
bad that they're they can't figure out

6457.32 --> 6461.88
what to do anymore then just let them

6459.96 --> 6465.36
die

6461.88 --> 6470.76
yeah and none of it is necessary CU

6465.36 --> 6474.96
there are a lot and I mean a huge amount

6470.76 --> 6477.719
of holistic medical

6474.96 --> 6481.04
developments and insights on how to deal

6477.719 --> 6484.96
with the body physically and even

6481.04 --> 6488.84
spiritually it's very Advanced very very

6484.96 --> 6491.639
Advanced it was Advanced 20 years ago

6488.84 --> 6493.84
it's even more advanced now it is it's

6491.639 --> 6497.56
becoming Star Trek

6493.84 --> 6499.04
level like that's not off and and it is

6497.56 --> 6502.4800000000005
Star Trek

6499.04 --> 6504.76
level the actual medical alternative

6502.48 --> 6504.759999999999
knowledge

6505.84 --> 6509.679
you can't have at this point just have

6508.04 --> 6514.4
devices where you

6509.679 --> 6517.32
do without the sound and it will just

6514.4 --> 6520.638999999999
heal there's incredible devices like

6517.32 --> 6523.239
resonance sound based devices electrical

6520.639 --> 6526.08
incredible things and they have been

6523.239 --> 6528.759999999999
developed for for almost a century and

6526.08 --> 6530.88
they're just really refined now there

6528.76 --> 6533.599
has been development it's just not

6530.88 --> 6535.36
mainstreamed it's not mainlined

6533.599 --> 6537.4800000000005
because the main line is still a

6535.36 --> 6542.598999999999
Eugenics based system

6537.48 --> 6545.32
that's been prioritized to get rid of

6542.599 --> 6548.360000000001
people not heal

6545.32 --> 6550.639
them and the doctors that are part of

6548.36 --> 6554.28
that they don't necessarily even know

6550.639 --> 6558.8
that it's just the procedures that they

6554.28 --> 6562.719
get told to do just amount to that they

6558.8 --> 6564.96
lead to that end and not to people get

6562.719 --> 6567.08
getting

6564.96 --> 6568.56
healthier and the doctors don't have to

6567.08 --> 6570.5599999999995
be in on it it's just the procedures

6568.56 --> 6576.159000000001
they get to

6570.56 --> 6578.8
do right so there's so much information

6576.159 --> 6581.48
that has come out in just the last few

6578.8 --> 6585.0
years alone but it's been going for a

6581.48 --> 6589.239
while that once The Siege is

6585.0 --> 6592.119
lifted like there is going to be a

6589.239 --> 6594.799999999999
massive intellectual Awakening and

6592.119 --> 6596.799999999999
revolution that that is completely

6594.8 --> 6599.56
without violence it's

6596.8 --> 6601.92
just people will literally just

6599.56 --> 6605.599
rearrange how how they do things and it

6601.92 --> 6605.599
will vastly

6605.84 --> 6613.159000000001
improve compared to how it has been in

6608.28 --> 6613.159
the last 10 years fast fast

6613.48 --> 6618.159
Improvement right all they need is a

6615.84 --> 6621.159000000001
little breathing

6618.159 --> 6624.719
room

6621.159 --> 6627.44
and by the time time that

6624.719 --> 6631.4
those yeah the intellectual revolutions

6627.44 --> 6633.799999999999
have integrated and become more

6631.4 --> 6636.04
public I'm sure there's going to be a

6633.8 --> 6638.400000000001
lot of debate again about Flat Earth

6636.04 --> 6640.56
like there was in 2015 and 16 and it

6638.4 --> 6643.839999999999
will like re flare

6640.56 --> 6647.280000000001
up right it's been another 10

6643.84 --> 6649.28
years it's going to just come back again

6647.28 --> 6652.48
the in the interest because there's

6649.28 --> 6656.32
breathing room right people that don't

6652.48 --> 6659.0
have have time because they're too busy

6656.32 --> 6662.639
stressing out on how to make meat ends

6659.0 --> 6664.48
meat and keep everything together like

6662.639 --> 6667.1990000000005
they don't have

6664.48 --> 6670.28
time to deal with flat Earth versus

6667.199 --> 6674.079
glove they don't have the time for that

6670.28 --> 6676.4
it's when they get the time for it that

6674.079 --> 6680.96
they will engage with it again that's

6676.4 --> 6683.079
how it works yeah so while we're in this

6680.96 --> 6683.92
Western Siege

6683.079 --> 6686.199
by

6683.92 --> 6688.32
trotskyites that are trying to

6686.199 --> 6691.28
annihilate

6688.32 --> 6696.48
us there will be no flat Earth

6691.28 --> 6699.5599999999995
Revolution but once we get rid of them

6696.48 --> 6701.678999999999
somehow then the interest in Flat Earth

6699.56 --> 6703.2390000000005
will return because people will get more

6701.679 --> 6705.719
time on their hands because they're not

6703.239 --> 6708.199
so troubled anymore by the

6705.719 --> 6710.32
financial economic siege that they've

6708.199 --> 6712.0
been suppressed by they will have a

6710.32 --> 6713.32
little bit more time on their hands and

6712.0 --> 6715.4
then

6713.32 --> 6717.199
the debate can start back up and people

6715.4 --> 6720.759999999999
will go around again and just look like

6717.199 --> 6722.638999999999
hey what's this oh interesting that's an

6720.76 --> 6724.52
interesting story I have time to listen

6722.639 --> 6726.92
to that I have room in my soul to listen

6724.52 --> 6730.400000000001
to that because I'm not terribly worried

6726.92 --> 6730.4
about losing everything all the

6730.599 --> 6736.52
time

6732.599 --> 6738.599
yeah so that's how it

6736.52 --> 6743.639
is

6738.599 --> 6743.639
Frank just spent like

6743.8 --> 6749.360000000001
20 minutes explaining this very specific

6746.48 --> 6749.36
point to you

6749.679 --> 6753.8
right so you're just saying like oh we

6752.159 --> 6755.598999999999
need more this we need more that yeah no

6753.8 --> 6759.079000000001
it's not about

6755.599 --> 6763.32
that yeah it's not about we need this

6759.079 --> 6767.759999999999
now we need to get out of this

6763.32 --> 6767.759999999999
Siege before anything can be

6768.92 --> 6773.4400000000005
achieved because people if people don't

6771.4 --> 6777.079
have the room in their hearts and in

6773.44 --> 6780.678999999999
their minds they're not going to change

6777.079 --> 6783.4
their minds they're just going to try to

6780.679 --> 6785.84
work things out so that they can make

6783.4 --> 6785.839999999999
ends

6786.239 --> 6792.678999999999
meet yeah they're too

6789.4 --> 6796.839999999999
preoccupied to be able to deal with it

6792.679 --> 6798.2390000000005
and so they won't care they just like oh

6796.84 --> 6799.679
you have to work you have to do this you

6798.239 --> 6800.638999999999
have to do that you have to like balance

6799.679 --> 6803.079
it out

6800.639 --> 6804.639
and make sure that nobody your family

6803.079 --> 6805.84
goes insane so that everything is

6804.639 --> 6808.119
wrecked or

6805.84 --> 6810.0
something and then it's like yeah I

6808.119 --> 6811.839999999999
don't give a [ __ ] about Flat Earth or

6810.0 --> 6815.36
globe or anything they say on the news

6811.84 --> 6817.159000000001
about it like they won't care about oh

6815.36 --> 6819.199
climate change this climate change they

6817.159 --> 6821.159
will like they will it will all be the

6819.199 --> 6823.04
same to them it'll be like yeah I we

6821.159 --> 6826.199
don't have time for this

6823.04 --> 6827.88
garbage just make sure things don't get

6826.199 --> 6830.36
worse like that's the only thing they

6827.88 --> 6833.719
care about like just don't make things

6830.36 --> 6835.799999999999
get worse that's all

6833.719 --> 6838.4
they don't care about what is right or

6835.8 --> 6839.96
what is wrong they just care about don't

6838.4 --> 6843.28
make things

6839.96 --> 6843.28
worse that's

6847.84 --> 6853.88
all right we don't need more debates on

6851.719 --> 6856.4
the

6853.88 --> 6858.96
internet well that's there is places for

6856.4 --> 6861.92
debates and there will be interest for

6858.96 --> 6863.84
debates yeah people do find it

6861.92 --> 6866.36
interesting

6863.84 --> 6870.04
they do need to work through this

6866.36 --> 6873.799999999999
intellectually so there is Need for

6870.04 --> 6876.96
debates it's just that

6873.8 --> 6880.159000000001
priorities again Frank are are you

6876.96 --> 6883.52
actually listening to what I'm

6880.159 --> 6885.879999999999
saying yeah it's about priorities and

6883.52 --> 6888.84
right now is not a time for that people

6885.88 --> 6890.159000000001
are too preoccupied with trying to make

6888.84 --> 6893.159000000001
ends

6890.159 --> 6898.48
meet they don't have room in their

6893.159 --> 6898.48
head to ponder about

6900.8 --> 6906.400000000001
debates they just want this overall

6904.8 --> 6908.8
financial

6906.4 --> 6911.799999999999
situation to change for the better they

6908.8 --> 6915.0
want the siege to end and after that

6911.8 --> 6917.360000000001
point they'll start to have some

6915.0 --> 6920.8
room it's getting

6917.36 --> 6924.04
repetitive okay well do you understand

6920.8 --> 6924.04
my point

6936.119 --> 6941.679
you have a different opinion okay well

6938.079 --> 6941.679
then you're not rational I

6944.199 --> 6948.5599999999995
guess fine whatever

6954.28 --> 6958.159
it's not about opinions this is about

6956.119 --> 6961.159
how things

6958.159 --> 6961.159
work

6977.719 --> 6987.0
yeah yeah truth is a luxury

6983.079 --> 6990.079
compared to survival

6987.0 --> 6992.96
needs it

6990.079 --> 6994.92
is you just like to see some change

6992.96 --> 6999.2390000000005
that's all well yeah why don't you start

6994.92 --> 7000.92
with changing this the end of The Siege

6999.239 --> 7002.638999999999
how about that that's the change that I

7000.92 --> 7003.639
want to see I want to see things get

7002.639 --> 7006.56
back to

7003.639 --> 7008.84
normal and then I'll deal with

7006.56 --> 7011.04
intellectual

7008.84 --> 7015.2390000000005
revolutions I mean I'm still dealing

7011.04 --> 7019.599
with it but but I mean like nobody cares

7015.239 --> 7023.839999999999
at this point like I get less attention

7019.599 --> 7027.76
here on YouTube because of the siege

7023.84 --> 7030.0
it's happening it's all dying down since

7027.76 --> 7032.119000000001
the

7030.0 --> 7037.84
siege

7032.119 --> 7037.839999999999
palpably very noticeably to me

7039.199 --> 7045.638999999999
yeah The Siege ends then my channel can

7042.84 --> 7049.76
potentially grow I can get more support

7045.639 --> 7052.96
and I could potentially improve my show

7049.76 --> 7055.84
and my overall situation and all

7052.96 --> 7059.2390000000005
that and and maybe even go to

7055.84 --> 7061.719
universities and like talk to people

7059.239 --> 7063.759999999999
there maybe even get little bit of

7061.719 --> 7066.2390000000005
lectures about Flat Earth or whatever if

7063.76 --> 7070.2390000000005
I'm invited all that could potentially

7066.239 --> 7075.638999999999
be possible but in order to get there

7070.239 --> 7075.638999999999
the financial Siege needs to end

7121.199 --> 7124.719
that would be amazing

7125.0 --> 7132.599
yeah right so anybody still here I got

7128.96 --> 7135.44
27 watching but two people in the chat

7132.599 --> 7139.639
I guess that that's enough nobody's

7135.44 --> 7139.638999999999
really like talking

7154.84 --> 7159.639
here you don't think YouTube is the

7157.239 --> 7163.759999999999
future F Well Frank it's not just

7159.639 --> 7163.76
YouTube it's everything

7165.639 --> 7170.679
everything yeah it's not YouTube if I go

7168.36 --> 7174.0
to Tik Tok the same damn thing will

7170.679 --> 7176.1990000000005
happen immediately go to rumble the same

7174.0 --> 7179.119
damn thing

7176.199 --> 7180.598999999999
happens same Wherever I Go the same damn

7179.119 --> 7183.159
thing is going to

7180.599 --> 7185.639
happen there is no place where you're

7183.159 --> 7188.44
not going to get clamped down on why

7185.639 --> 7188.4400000000005
because it's

7188.639 --> 7193.639
media all these media groups all have

7191.88 --> 7197.04
the the same

7193.639 --> 7200.079
conspiracy they all need to be available

7197.04 --> 7202.719
they all need the channel the the cables

7200.079 --> 7206.0
to be able to go through them if they

7202.719 --> 7209.119
don't adapt to the universal policy in

7206.0 --> 7213.32
which Flat Earth is is cut down

7209.119 --> 7216.639
dramatically then they don't get to

7213.32 --> 7218.44
function then their system won't be

7216.639 --> 7222.4400000000005
working

7218.44 --> 7222.44
properly yeah

7225.199 --> 7231.0
if they want to be a successful Network

7227.44 --> 7235.759999999999
at anything a social media Network then

7231.0 --> 7238.96
they have to adapt to the suppression

7235.76 --> 7240.719
policies that's just how it is they

7238.96 --> 7243.56
don't get the choice well they do get a

7240.719 --> 7246.88
choice but then they will always be

7243.56 --> 7251.400000000001
small the more freedom they want the

7246.88 --> 7251.400000000001
smaller they will stay

7261.719 --> 7266.44
you really think that's going to happen

7264.0 --> 7269.88
with all the censorship it's all a

7266.44 --> 7269.879999999999
matter of just finding

7271.159 --> 7277.119
people and putting myself out there I

7274.239 --> 7281.44
mean I'm going to have a little show

7277.119 --> 7283.36
with David Weiss and he's going to also

7281.44 --> 7285.119
post that on on his channel so it's just

7283.36 --> 7289.119
all about connecting

7285.119 --> 7289.119
up getting other people's

7289.719 --> 7296.679
attention and showing them the new Arwin

7293.96 --> 7299.52
right I mean the Arwin from four or five

7296.679 --> 7301.76
years ago well I don't think a lot of

7299.52 --> 7303.76
people were particularly interested in

7301.76 --> 7307.2390000000005
that I mean I still already had some

7303.76 --> 7309.4400000000005
interesting ideas and some bright

7307.239 --> 7313.36
insights

7309.44 --> 7315.719
but not so refined

7313.36 --> 7319.0
I'm a lot more refined right

7315.719 --> 7322.199
now have more

7319.0 --> 7324.8
Dynamic I'm more amicable and I strive

7322.199 --> 7328.0
to become even more amicable doesn't

7324.8 --> 7329.8
mean that I can't be biting off being

7328.0 --> 7333.199
self-defensive

7329.8 --> 7336.400000000001
right but it means that I just won't be

7333.199 --> 7339.079
so burdened by overreactions

7336.4 --> 7341.96
emotionally and so people need to see

7339.079 --> 7344.079
that they just need to see

7341.96 --> 7347.76
what I'm like right

7344.079 --> 7349.92
now and then that will draw in more

7347.76 --> 7352.88
people and it's really the only thing

7349.92 --> 7352.88
that I can do

7353.719 --> 7359.079
right and I I have confidence I have

7356.8 --> 7362.28
confidence in myself I've come a long

7359.079 --> 7362.28
way I'm I'm doing

7362.92 --> 7368.56
great just because my channel is not

7366.56 --> 7373.84
exploding doesn't mean that I'm not

7368.56 --> 7373.84
doing good I am provably doing good

7374.0 --> 7376.639
doing just

7379.44 --> 7383.799999999999
fine right and it's not even it's not

7381.719 --> 7385.88
about growing the subscriber numbers

7383.8 --> 7388.76
either

7385.88 --> 7390.76
Frank it's about

7388.76 --> 7394.2390000000005
growing

7390.76 --> 7398.119000000001
following and people that know about

7394.239 --> 7401.119
me second hand word of mouth it's like

7398.119 --> 7404.28
oh yeah our win Channel like they don't

7401.119 --> 7407.5199999999995
need to come here every day and watch it

7404.28 --> 7410.28
a lot of them probably won't but they'll

7407.52 --> 7412.76
know that I'm here and available is like

7410.28 --> 7414.8
oh maybe they have a day off and they're

7412.76 --> 7417.280000000001
like really like bored or whatever and

7414.8 --> 7418.96
they just like well let's let's just

7417.28 --> 7421.8
hang around to flatter Earth early we

7418.96 --> 7423.84
show today and then they know like yeah

7421.8 --> 7426.360000000001
you can do that I'm here and they could

7423.84 --> 7429.159000000001
talk and then have an interaction and be

7426.36 --> 7431.48
surprised that can be really interesting

7429.159 --> 7433.719
and stimulating right and that's what I

7431.48 --> 7433.718999999999
need

7434.36 --> 7439.92
that people know I'm

7436.48 --> 7443.879999999999
here and that they can deal with me that

7439.92 --> 7446.52
I am much better than I used to be and

7443.88 --> 7449.76
that I strive to be even better and that

7446.52 --> 7449.76
it will keep

7453.199 --> 7457.799999999999
developing right and censorship it's

7456.239 --> 7461.199
it's not really

7457.8 --> 7463.96
relevant like the censorship is not

7461.199 --> 7466.36
stopping me at this

7463.96 --> 7467.92
point and neither is it with other

7466.36 --> 7469.759999999999
people I mean just look at Matt from

7467.92 --> 7472.719
Quantum of conscious he pretty much

7469.76 --> 7476.1990000000005
addresses everything but he just uses

7472.719 --> 7479.119
his special hobo code and like everybody

7476.199 --> 7480.879999999999
even expects that from him like how he

7479.119 --> 7485.079
calls

7480.88 --> 7487.96
things is like that's comedy almost like

7485.079 --> 7490.32
his very specific hobo codes are like

7487.96 --> 7492.159
everybody expects that from him and that

7490.32 --> 7494.159
still enables him to

7492.159 --> 7497.759999999999
talk about those

7494.159 --> 7500.48
subjects without getting in

7497.76 --> 7505.079000000001
trouble and the same goes for me like I

7500.48 --> 7507.4
can just say now like yeah medical

7505.079 --> 7510.239
experimentation don't do

7507.4 --> 7512.638999999999
it you're technically not forced to do

7510.239 --> 7516.48
it and you'll be sorry if you do it yeah

7512.639 --> 7520.52
and it won't get into trouble for it

7516.48 --> 7523.638999999999
yet vast majority of people will know

7520.52 --> 7523.639
what I'm talking about

7523.96 --> 7532.36
yeah and I I had didn't have that in

7528.36 --> 7532.36
2020 and to

7532.92 --> 7540.36
2022 I was more direct about naming the

7537.199 --> 7543.36
procedures and that got those shows into

7540.36 --> 7547.44
trouble it was helpful at the

7543.36 --> 7547.44
time I did warn a lot of

7548.28 --> 7554.599
people right but

7552.32 --> 7557.32
yeah a lot of videos get taken down from

7554.599 --> 7559.159000000001
that and it's not really important

7557.32 --> 7561.88
anyway because it's like yeah it's just

7559.159 --> 7563.799999999999
a casual show not really that special

7561.88 --> 7566.76
the subject came up and I just said it

7563.8 --> 7570.0
and now they're they're gone but I mean

7566.76 --> 7571.8
they were just important to be out then

7570.0 --> 7575.599
it's not really relevant afterward I

7571.8 --> 7575.599
mean nobody cares about those shows

7576.52 --> 7582.84
now yeah so I can just talk about that

7580.88 --> 7585.84
kind of subject

7582.84 --> 7588.559
and bypass any

7585.84 --> 7591.92
hazards great self-improvement so far

7588.559 --> 7595.079000000001
thank you I know probably trying to be

7591.92 --> 7597.4800000000005
in in sarcastic or whatever I don't care

7595.079 --> 7599.36
I know it is a good self-improvement I

7597.48 --> 7603.36
am

7599.36 --> 7603.36
improved yeah

7620.32 --> 7625.96
so it's all

7622.32 --> 7625.96
right it will be

7626.48 --> 7630.718999999999
okay and we are going to get

7631.679 --> 7637.599
somewhere and maybe at some point in the

7634.96 --> 7641.8
future even my more Niche

7637.599 --> 7644.8
ideas and the experiments the tests that

7641.8 --> 7647.360000000001
might become actual

7644.8 --> 7649.079000000001
experiments they might even be performed

7647.36 --> 7652.079
at some point I mean that would be

7649.079 --> 7654.199
pretty epic but there needs to be an end

7652.079 --> 7657.239
to the siege and some

7654.199 --> 7659.919999999999
room some room for people to be able to

7657.239 --> 7662.4
consider to do that without just fearing

7659.92 --> 7664.4800000000005
giant losses like oh we can't do that

7662.4 --> 7666.28
because we can't make a a direct profit

7664.48 --> 7668.558999999999
from it and we need a profit to do

7666.28 --> 7671.239
anything or we'll all lose everything

7668.559 --> 7674.559
like yeah that's not when it's like that

7671.239 --> 7678.32
you can't accomplish

7674.559 --> 7681.599
anything you can't figure out new things

7678.32 --> 7685.119
it just it's because it's all too

7681.599 --> 7689.360000000001
risky yeah so The Siege needs to end

7685.119 --> 7695.28
first and then intellectual revolutions

7689.36 --> 7695.28
and Progressive developments can

7697.92 --> 7701.32
happen right so anyway I'm going to take

7700.04 --> 7702.119
a two-minute break and I'll be right

7701.32 --> 7704.799999999999
back

7702.119 --> 7704.799999999999

flat and intellectual Revolution after

7987.36 --> 7989.558999999999
the

7992.199 --> 7996.04
siege that fits pretty

7996.719 --> 8002.2390000000005
concisely what your dad passed away damn

8011.0 --> 8018.76

he hang in

8059.4 --> 8066.04
there all right

8062.28 --> 8066.04
so people are having a tough time I

8067.559 --> 8072.52
guess fi also is having a tough

8072.8 --> 8076.76
time right but I'm

8080.48 --> 8084.48
here7 right

8113.04 --> 8118.92
all right anyway everybody here don't

8114.84 --> 8118.92
forget the Rogan it up

8122.96 --> 8127.88
2 hours 15 minutes in uh

8131.079 --> 8135.88
yeah can still go for a bit I mean the

8133.639 --> 8139.0
temperature is a lot better now

8135.88 --> 8141.599
here and I I do feel like I've properly

8139.0 --> 8146.119
warmed upan it's been a pretty good show

8141.599 --> 8146.119000000001
overall despite troll

8149.92 --> 8153.96
activity for

8209.439 --> 8214.559000000001
yeah how's your mother holding option

8211.559 --> 8214.559
clear

8246.319 --> 8249.279999999999
oh you watching

8269.84 --> 8273.8
down for

8298.25 --> 8301.28
[Music]

8304.599 --> 8309.16
the Consciousness is fascinating how

8306.84 --> 8313.639000000001
yeah of course it is

8309.16 --> 8313.639
but in what sense

8338.35 --> 8341.52
[Music]

8359.12 --> 8362.719000000001
slip in out of consciousness

8362.84 --> 8366.319
what okay that's

8389.64 --> 8393.68
weird for

8448.68 --> 8456.08
we are the light not the bulb yeah

8452.16 --> 8456.08
now Consciousness is separate from the

8458.84 --> 8464.8
body and when the

8460.92 --> 8468.72
body makes it unable for you to

8464.8 --> 8471.358999999999
connect that Consciousness to

8468.72 --> 8474.119999999999
communicate with the outside world yeah

8471.359 --> 8477.960000000001
it's still it's still there it's just

8474.12 --> 8477.960000000001
not connecting anymore

8482.56 --> 8486.359
it might connect you through the

8484.399 --> 8489.76
collective

8486.359 --> 8492.76
Spirit through the spirit ether if you

8489.76 --> 8494.880000000001
will talking about anybody seen seeking

8492.76 --> 8499.92
starwater

8494.88 --> 8499.92
around maybe should email her

8539.52 --> 8543.479000000001
e e

8553.58 --> 8556.69
[Applause]

8586.479 --> 8589.479
is

8590.43 --> 8593.53
[Applause]

8619.16 --> 8623.64
all right so let's see why that happens

8689.319 --> 8693.359
what for

8763.9 --> 8767.359
[Music]

8765.479 --> 8771.92
right so

8767.359 --> 8774.52
yeah again sorry about your father

welcome here to just hang and

8784.24 --> 8789.76

8786.65 --> 8789.76
[Music]

8789.92 --> 8794.960000000001
things right and you can also like

8792.84 --> 8798.960000000001
contact me oneon-one on Skype if you

8794.96 --> 8798.96
want to talk privately that's also

8803.64 --> 8813.199999999999
cool but yeah hope you'll uh be all

8809.24 --> 8813.199999999999
right for

8843.52 --> 8846.24
okay and I guess I'm going to round out

8845.08 --> 8849.16
the

8846.24 --> 8851.76
show unless anybody else had still had

8849.16 --> 8851.76
anything to

8853.68 --> 8856.68
say

8857.96 --> 8863.16
okay been going for two hours almost and

8861.68 --> 8865.6
30 minutes

8863.16 --> 8868.2
and I mean it could go on for a little

8865.6 --> 8872.12
bit longer but yeah I mean not if it's

8868.2 --> 8872.12
going to be just dead silence in

8884.439 --> 8887.439
chat

8890.76 --> 8896.399
right so anything else out

8899.12 --> 8903.08
there for

8948.56 --> 8953.479
this interesting there's an article here

8950.76 --> 8955.960000000001
Dutch article

8953.479 --> 8958.88
about what they now call climate

8955.96 --> 8962.039999999999
communism which is a pretty good word

8958.88 --> 8962.039999999999
for it

8962.88 --> 8965.438999999998
and they're going

8968.64 --> 8973.88
to they're going to try it and it's not

8971.24 --> 8976.199999999999
going to work and it should be cancelled

8973.88 --> 8976.199999999999
and they

8976.92 --> 8983.279
are you woke up late today on my way to

8980.0 --> 8984.439
coffee now okay don't worries at I mean

8983.279 --> 8988.76
you're like in

8984.439 --> 8991.76
a vacation period right now we did talk

8988.76 --> 8991.76
yesterday

9013.8 --> 9018.64
all

9015.72 --> 9021.679999999998
right but I am

9018.64 --> 9024.199999999999
certainly for for a movement against

9021.68 --> 9028.279
this climate communism because it is

9024.2 --> 9028.279
it's a Siege that's why I call it

9028.319 --> 9034.119999999999
Siege it's not to make things

9031.279 --> 9038.319000000001
environmentally better it doesn't do

9034.12 --> 9041.399000000001
that at all it just cuts everything

9038.319 --> 9043.399
off effectively functioning like a Siege

9041.399 --> 9046.519999999999
a climate

9043.399 --> 9048.358999999999
Siege makes everything more expensive

9046.52 --> 9052.359
more hard to

9048.359 --> 9054.479000000001
get more Pro to accidents effectively

9052.359 --> 9057.960000000001
things don't work

9054.479 --> 9061.278999999999
smoothly economy get

9057.96 --> 9064.119999999999
stagnates and then transport slows down

9061.279 --> 9065.720000000001
and then things go wrong and it actually

9064.12 --> 9068.240000000002
causes

9065.72 --> 9070.199999999999
more climate

9068.24 --> 9073.24
damage

9070.2 --> 9076.12
yeah very few things are worse for the

9073.24 --> 9078.6
climate than when the economy

9076.12 --> 9081.92
crumbles because then people will be

9078.6 --> 9081.92
inclined to

9082.359 --> 9087.2
skip as many steps as they can to still

9085.2 --> 9089.240000000002
make it financially

9087.2 --> 9092.240000000002
viable yeah and guess what they're going

9089.24 --> 9094.08
to choose if they even have the option

9092.24 --> 9096.439
in order to to achieve that they're

9094.08 --> 9099.24
going to not give a [ __ ] about

9096.439 --> 9101.960000000001
environment they're going to care about

9099.24 --> 9104.8
it being survivable and

9101.96 --> 9107.16
doable yeah

9104.8 --> 9110.759999999998
environmentalism works best when

9107.16 --> 9110.76
everybody's wealthy

9111.24 --> 9119.52
because you have the

9114.2 --> 9123.0
room to do it to take care of

9119.52 --> 9125.16
nature or to prevent damage to Nature

9123.0 --> 9127.12
because you have Financial room you you

9125.16 --> 9131.16
have some

9127.12 --> 9132.720000000001
flexibility yeah if you're financially

9131.16 --> 9135.56
besieged

9132.72 --> 9136.84
then people are going to choose not to

9135.56 --> 9138.439
give a [ __ ] about

9136.84 --> 9142.52
nature

9138.439 --> 9147.12
because they can't afford

9142.52 --> 9147.12
to because it is technically like a

9147.479 --> 9155.64
luxury yeah like a a third world country

9153.0 --> 9159.12
corporation that doesn't have outside

9155.64 --> 9160.479
financing is not really going to care at

9159.12 --> 9165.359
all about the

9160.479 --> 9168.039999999999
environment cuz it doesn't have that

9165.359 --> 9171.04
option it's like oh no we just have to

9168.04 --> 9174.319000000001
make men's meat as as easily as possible

9171.04 --> 9177.92
and like they're not going to be able

9174.319 --> 9180.72
to really take care of nature or prevent

9177.92 --> 9182.64
damage as much because they don't have

9180.72 --> 9184.278999999999
the luxury to do

9182.64 --> 9187.358999999999
that

9184.279 --> 9192.08
yeah that's practical

9187.359 --> 9192.08
reality real environmentalism

9192.92 --> 9200.279
requires some luxury some

9196.279 --> 9202.640000000001
Financial stability

9200.279 --> 9205.439
it's a luxury it's a a luxury that's

9202.64 --> 9208.24
much needed like I like environmentalism

9205.439 --> 9211.279
I like healthy nature it's better for

9208.24 --> 9211.279
food it's better for

9212.56 --> 9218.72
everything but you can't overstimulate

9215.359 --> 9221.2
it to the point where people don't have

9218.72 --> 9224.599999999999
Financial wealth

9221.2 --> 9226.92
anymore because then nature is going to

9224.6 --> 9226.92
be

9227.96 --> 9231.72
sacrificed it's what people

9241.08 --> 9244.68
too I don't know

9246.6 --> 9250.84
diet could be

9264.53 --> 9267.739000000001
[Music]

9282.359 --> 9291.279
welcome please don't forget to rogin it

9285.84 --> 9291.279
up this show guys come on

9312.88 --> 9316.72
right but yeah di then if that I don't

9314.84 --> 9319.880000000001
know exactly how it works it could be

9316.72 --> 9322.0
that it has the lowest rate because if

9319.88 --> 9324.64
you don't

9322.0 --> 9326.84
report officially that you're looking

9324.64 --> 9329.399
for work and that you're un unemployed

9326.84 --> 9332.16
then they don't register

9329.399 --> 9336.0
it like people that stopped looking for

9332.16 --> 9339.16
work they don't get registered as

9336.0 --> 9342.359
unemployed in those numbers that's what

9339.16 --> 9344.359
I heard last time my uh my attention

9342.359 --> 9347.359
fell onto

9344.359 --> 9347.359
that

9347.72 --> 9351.64
so I don't know

9360.54 --> 9363.649000000001
[Music]

9378.56 --> 9382.56
that's for

9417.56 --> 9420.56

know what what it is with you guys do I

9631.76 --> 9636.319
just need to let the trolls talk their

9633.96 --> 9639.438999999998
[ __ ] is that the only thing that's going

9636.319 --> 9641.64
to stimulate you from actually saying

9639.439 --> 9644.76
anything is that why nobody says

9641.64 --> 9649.399
anything because I kick the trolls out

9644.76 --> 9652.72
do I just need to let them talk [ __ ]

9649.399 --> 9656.08
because otherwise you don't say

9652.72 --> 9659.039999999999
anything CU I'm not entirely sure

9656.08 --> 9659.039999999999
anymore at this

9663.92 --> 9669.8
point I'm doing anything that I can

9666.84 --> 9671.72
think of trying to keep the conversation

9669.8 --> 9675.8
going trying to bring out subjects and

9671.72 --> 9678.92
roll them out and argue them and then

9675.8 --> 9681.72
yeah apparently it doesn't do anything

9678.92 --> 9684.52
for you guys or maybe it does but you

9681.72 --> 9687.679999999998
don't know how to respond I don't know I

9684.52 --> 9690.560000000001
don't know because nobody says

9687.68 --> 9692.76
anything nobody seems to respond to what

9690.56 --> 9692.76
I

9697.8 --> 9704.599999999999
say and if you don't find the subjects I

9700.88 --> 9706.759999999998
talk about stimulating in any sense well

9704.6 --> 9710.16
maybe you could bring up a subject that

9706.76 --> 9713.12
you find stimulating to talk about

9710.16 --> 9713.119999999999
that's not a

9713.92 --> 9718.92
troll yeah that's why I'm open to

9720.2 --> 9726.240000000002

but you can have a

9773.92 --> 9779.08
conversation you can even disagree with

9776.52 --> 9783.52
what I talk about would be great though

9779.08 --> 9788.84
if you actually then argued what about I

9783.52 --> 9790.2

9788.84 --> 9793.84
