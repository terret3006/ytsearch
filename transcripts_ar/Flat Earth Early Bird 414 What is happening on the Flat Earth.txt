40.52 --> 48.18000000000001
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

44.49 --> 50.22
early-bird number 414 I'm your host

48.18 --> 52.23
Arwen and before start the show please

50.22 --> 54.0

65.94 --> 72.14999999999999
chat that will be much appreciated so

68.99 --> 76.5
yeah and thank you for a couple of

72.15 --> 77.72
donations recently to PayPal they wanted

76.5 --> 80.88
to stay anonymous

77.72 --> 84.33
and that's fine here's the weather looks

80.88 --> 88.44
quite beautiful but it's a bit rainy

84.33 --> 90.96
sometimes I haven't seen the Sun for a

88.44 --> 92.7
while although that does seem to be a

90.96 --> 96.0
couple of blue spots here and there so

92.7 --> 100.77000000000001
maybe you'll get to see it before it the

96.0 --> 104.1
evening starts again but yeah lots of

100.77 --> 108.38
birds around I still haven't seen George

104.1 --> 113.00999999999999
I keep on seeing the other two crows I

108.38 --> 115.92
don't see George weirdly enough the

113.01 --> 120.09
other twos crows seem to be somewhat

115.92 --> 124.56
slightly less take keeping their

120.09 --> 128.51
distance I get the feeling something

124.56 --> 128.51
happened to George but yeah

128.94 --> 139.71
probably never find out anyway yeah I

133.65 --> 142.41
got green tea with me today let's see

139.71 --> 147.06
who is in jet see if I can get all the

142.41 --> 150.57
way to the beginning right yeah all

147.06 --> 157.8
right so mark marshall was first a GM

150.57 --> 159.95999999999998
Tom Parker New Zealand 20 $20 I guess

157.8 --> 168.42000000000002
that's basically what that name says

159.96 --> 172.8
ends at D 20 point Oh Oh Martin Ellen

10th January 2020 see what are you

197.01 --> 199.28
saying

199.55 --> 206.62900000000002
Robin Stanley I don't know did something

202.739 --> 210.12
happen to her I I don't know she comes

206.629 --> 213.17999999999998
she comes on in my chat every now and

210.12 --> 218.459
then I don't know she's just probably

213.18 --> 222.06
working or something not everybody

218.459 --> 224.22
always has time for all of this a secret

222.06 --> 225.62
Asian man long time no see here on

224.22 --> 228.35999999999999
YouTube

225.62 --> 231.53
you're always streaming on D life you're

228.36 --> 231.53
always streaming something

244.69 --> 249.02
hey if you want to stream something

247.07 --> 254.51
restream something interesting maybe you

249.02 --> 258.38
should try streaming what is it yeah

254.51 --> 260.40999999999997
what ranty did aunty show yesterday did

258.38 --> 266.45
did everybody see that

260.41 --> 268.16
man oh and by the way I'm trying to hold

266.45 --> 272.51
back a little because yesterday was just

268.16 --> 276.20000000000005
crazy I've literally been been like

272.51 --> 280.94
active just like this first hour early

276.2 --> 284.71
bird show second our Flat Earth debates

280.94 --> 290.15
third our aftershow Flat Earth debates

284.71 --> 293.93
fourth and now wait yeah fourth our be

290.15 --> 297.83
happy ever after show fifth hour the

293.93 --> 301.61
second hour of Jose's show okay so I've

297.83 --> 305.24
been freaking five hours almost non-stop

301.61 --> 307.88
and I was pretty good at it

305.24 --> 310.97
even though latter part I did have a bit

307.88 --> 312.08
of alcohol I tried to contain the

310.97 --> 318.17
floppiness

312.08 --> 322.49
my speech as much as possible but I

318.17 --> 326.89000000000004
still crushed it still nailed it so did

322.49 --> 326.89
anybody else that take notice of that

332.889 --> 344.71000000000004
all right secret a Sherman it was kind

340.24 --> 347.229
of freaky because the way I handled

344.71 --> 350.10999999999996
myself in the happy-ever-after show is

347.229 --> 353.05
like I am normally a.m. it's like I take

350.11 --> 354.909
off all the restrictions and I'm

353.05 --> 356.949
basically just goofing around being very

354.909 --> 358.629
forward getting in people's face even

356.949 --> 361.93
was even getting a little annoying it's

358.629 --> 363.819
just just an arwing unrestrained it's

361.93 --> 368.05
kind of like how I used to be in my

363.819 --> 369.879
teens but I try not to get to it yeah I

368.05 --> 372.90000000000003
try to avoid negativity as much as

369.879 --> 376.029
possible but I get much more direct and

372.9 --> 380.69899999999996
yet John was just getting on my nerves

376.029 --> 383.62
and I just totally blasted off at him

380.699 --> 388.689
like really trying to get him in line

383.62 --> 392.139
because he was just you know doing what

388.689 --> 394.509
he did he always does that but you know

392.139 --> 397.06
sometimes I just really wish he just

394.509 --> 399.58000000000004
keep hold it back like just don't get

397.06 --> 401.68
involved because you're just getting in

399.58 --> 403.599
the way in the way you do it and I

401.68 --> 405.37
blasted off against him but I did that

403.599 --> 407.05
because I didn't think it was being

405.37 --> 410.409
recorded but apparently you rent you

407.05 --> 413.169
recorded at all this and afterward I

410.409 --> 418.96
realized that it was like oh damn okay

413.169 --> 421.29999999999995
well I guess I guess it's okay but yeah

418.96 --> 425.349
a retrospect holy [ __ ] we really went

421.3 --> 429.43
off against Bob but deservedly so really

425.349 --> 434.289
it's just something we haven't really we

429.43 --> 436.419
have chosen not to go there before but

434.289 --> 439.56899999999996
with what Bob recently did with his

436.419 --> 442.27
ridiculous new claims and admin

439.569 --> 444.58000000000004
statements about fantasies without

442.27 --> 447.06899999999996
actual empirical backed evidence yeah

444.58 --> 449.05
that just that was the the drop that

447.069 --> 451.33000000000004
made the bucket spill even back then in

449.05 --> 454.389
Friday I took note of it I said it and

451.33 --> 458.62
people were like oh my god this is just

454.389 --> 460.629
so annoying like why Bob why and then

458.62 --> 464.56
Sunday happened and it just doubled down

460.629 --> 466.71000000000004
and yeah and everybody got really sick

464.56 --> 481.51
of it so this just happened

466.71 --> 487.92999999999995
it's been coming for a while right

481.51 --> 492.09999999999997
yeah well pumpkin yes but well dick is

487.93 --> 494.29
not always look at ease his hit is being

492.1 --> 497.07000000000005
annoying is in a very structural

494.29 --> 499.26000000000005
persistent way he's not unpredictable

497.07 --> 502.84
maybe he's a little bit too predictable

499.26 --> 505.96
that's the problem but it's not the same

502.84 --> 509.28999999999996
certain other individuals he doesn't try

505.96 --> 513.91
to really trick you it's more defensive

509.29 --> 516.1
mechanisms that get in the way and I

513.91 --> 518.86
don't know I can generally deal with it

516.1 --> 521.41
but he does just get in the way a lot

518.86 --> 523.48
even on the debates just gets Moody and

521.41 --> 524.68
starts just yelling over everybody and

523.48 --> 528.46
then complaining that they're

524.68 --> 530.8299999999999
interrupting him even though people who

528.46 --> 534.0400000000001
are doing other stuff now I do it

530.83 --> 536.26
sometimes too but then afterward soon as

534.04 --> 539.8299999999999
that's out pretty much realized like oh

536.26 --> 541.84
[ __ ] that wasn't really correct the way

539.83 --> 546.5500000000001
I did that and then kind of like try to

541.84 --> 549.37
restore it at least it John takes a lot

546.55 --> 552.0699999999999
longer in order to basically correct

549.37 --> 554.17
himself but he does do it because times

552.07 --> 556.72
that he really went off and like

554.17 --> 559.5999999999999
especially on me or Nathan then in the

556.72 --> 562.69
after show like after the recording

559.6 --> 567.1
stopped he would like like yeah sorry

562.69 --> 575.8800000000001
about that then so you know he's not a

567.1 --> 575.88
shameless individual he's just John

577.04 --> 584.37
and he knows it you know it must be

581.55 --> 587.28
pretty tough being him in a certain way

584.37 --> 597.24
and maybe really easy in others because

587.28 --> 600.5699999999999
yeah anyway so much but still you know

597.24 --> 602.94
you can't underestimate the value off of

600.57 --> 605.46
his the oversight of his knowledge

602.94 --> 607.5
because it doesn't know a lot the

605.46 --> 610.76
problem is that he seems to be anchored

607.5 --> 617.07
in some of that knowledge and mainly the

610.76 --> 618.63
the the the particle concept and I've

617.07 --> 620.85
personally be stepping away from that

618.63 --> 623.1899999999999
and then I immediately gets defensive as

620.85 --> 627.84
soon as I bring that up like even when

623.19 --> 630.21
he doesn't engage with this agitation

627.84 --> 631.4100000000001
you can still hear and how he talks that

630.21 --> 634.6500000000001
he's annoyed by it

631.41 --> 637.68
you always hear that so it's his

634.65 --> 640.26
personal thing and I don't yeah he may

637.68 --> 642.51
be but yeah he may be gatekeeping

640.26 --> 645.27
effectively but i don't think he's been

642.51 --> 647.13
tasked to do that I think he's just

645.27 --> 653.52
doing that by accident by his own

647.13 --> 656.64
personal convictions and that's why I'm

653.52 --> 659.46
not declaring enemies that's why I don't

656.64 --> 661.14
distrust him and get Savannah on him

659.46 --> 665.34
some like like some other individuals

661.14 --> 670.99
because John's just a complicated guy

665.34 --> 675.0600000000001
[Music]

670.99 --> 679.66
well Tom Parker in certain ways yes I

675.06 --> 683.92
think John has a very good memory maybe

679.66 --> 687.3399999999999
too good for his own comfort and it's

683.92 --> 689.56
kind of interesting because I know other

687.34 --> 693.25
individuals that have the same problem

689.56 --> 695.8599999999999
say what my brother for example claimed

693.25 --> 700.0
like yeah I remember things too much

695.86 --> 701.98
again and remember and without going

700.0 --> 707.44
into much detail he just explained to me

701.98 --> 709.57
like yeah that's I he perceived that as

707.44 --> 713.1
a problem and I think that that is a

709.57 --> 713.1
little bit the case with quantum eraser

716.16 --> 722.14
because he is great at memorizing all

719.47 --> 726.1
his stuff all the structures for every

722.14 --> 728.8
detail like very he has just this

726.1 --> 734.1700000000001
capability to memorize very compact

728.8 --> 736.78
information but at the same time he has

734.17 --> 739.36
pretty good over sighted but he still

736.78 --> 741.55
anchored there's still like a cap to it

739.36 --> 744.8100000000001
as certain assumptions that he can't

741.55 --> 748.87
step away from that's just how he's

744.81 --> 750.76
programmed himself and he's dealing with

748.87 --> 753.3
way much more information than most

750.76 --> 759.13
people so that is just probably

753.3 --> 763.14
satisfactory to him then I get it I get

759.13 --> 767.4399999999999
it I think I just get John but anyway I

763.14 --> 772.3199999999999
personally am not satisfied and I have

767.44 --> 776.35
been delving into yeah figuring out what

772.32 --> 779.95
things could be alternatively like

776.35 --> 783.19
lights how it's probably not a invisible

779.95 --> 788.25
nature particle can be split up

783.19 --> 788.25
indefinitely there's there's no minimum

788.31 --> 793.65
and potentially the same for electricity

793.92 --> 800.62
but yeah it's just this this duality

796.99 --> 805.269
that I've pretty that for me has arrived

800.62 --> 809.14
between the material limitation versus

805.269 --> 812.47
the energies the more energy nated

809.14 --> 816.97
natured non material in the same way

812.47 --> 819.279
things and how that duality brings out

816.97 --> 823.0600000000001
problems for observation because if you

819.279 --> 825.04
want to measure anything you know when

823.06 --> 828.31
you measure things it's always comes

825.04 --> 830.86
down to a material device to matter so

828.31 --> 833.7689999999999
any kind of energy interaction is always

830.86 --> 839.13
going to be measured through material

833.769 --> 842.769
and therefore limited by the div yeah

839.13 --> 847.12
the indivisible nature of it of the

842.769 --> 849.55
particle well with light it is yeah it

847.12 --> 852.279
is infinitely divisible sorry if I mixed

849.55 --> 858.9399999999999
up the indivisible and infinitely

852.279 --> 861.43
divisible before anyway so that's just

858.94 --> 864.1
it piques my interest and somebody else

861.43 --> 866.26
an individual that most of us can't

864.1 --> 869.5600000000001
stand pretty much to be honest but yeah

866.26 --> 873.04
right the hand he's on that same track

869.56 --> 876.6999999999999
he's dipping into that same concept

873.04 --> 880.27
because he's pretty bright but the

876.7 --> 882.85
problem is that his character is just he

880.27 --> 888.63
can't handle himself and he's turned

882.85 --> 893.13
total so Vanya in any way the that yeah

888.63 --> 896.77
but that doesn't mean that I should just

893.13 --> 900.37
die I'm not willing to declare him even

896.77 --> 904.779
an enemy I just want him to stop with

900.37 --> 908.8
the attitude that's all I want him to be

904.779 --> 911.74
able to accomplish that because to be

908.8 --> 914.079
fair I need more people that are just

911.74 --> 919.99
smart enough to really figure this out

914.079 --> 921.4899999999999
what's going on and yeah for that they

919.99 --> 923.6800000000001
need to drop the attitude

921.49 --> 925.41
everyone does really but especially

923.68 --> 928.2589999999999
these people because

925.41 --> 932.2199999999999
I kind of need their input without

928.259 --> 936.269
constantly getting into bickering so

932.22 --> 942.48
yeah maybe it's too hopeful but I think

936.269 --> 944.73
that right to hand kind of felt it like

942.48 --> 950.279
I addressed him over at Jose's when was

944.73 --> 953.129
it two days ago and yeah he responded

950.279 --> 955.62
good to that and after like he doesn't

953.129 --> 958.86
attack me and anymore in chat so it

955.62 --> 961.379
really was heartfelt he he could feel

958.86 --> 964.769
that I was sincere when I try to address

961.379 --> 967.529
him about this and it's good it's a very

964.769 --> 971.25
good sign it's actually a better result

967.529 --> 973.379
than I had expected because before you

971.25 --> 976.74
would just stop listening and just

973.379 --> 979.259
always start reattaching again and again

976.74 --> 981.449
and this time like no he heard it and he

979.259 --> 983.129
was actually considering it I kind of

981.449 --> 987.87
was surprised they're happily surprised

983.129 --> 991.86
so who knows where this is gonna go do

987.87 --> 993.9590000000001
not underestimate people because you

991.86 --> 996.029
think something about them is screwed up

993.959 --> 999.779
and you think that can be never restored

996.029 --> 1003.439
because you don't understand it but yeah

999.779 --> 1007.759
people can develop can actually given

1003.439 --> 1009.61
enough time fix their issues or learn

1007.759 --> 1013.16
how to deal with it

1009.61 --> 1015.8290000000001
problem is it takes a lot more time

1013.16 --> 1019.939
usually to deal with especially

1015.829 --> 1023.329
emotional psychological problems then it

1019.939 --> 1025.6689999999999
does for them to to get worse visibly

1023.329 --> 1030.02
noticeably this is that's the problem

1025.669 --> 1035.409
and that's universal anyway enough about

1030.02 --> 1035.4089999999999
all that hey hello Nathan Oakley see you

1036.349 --> 1039.479
[Music]

1042.71 --> 1055.25
it's yeah logos it's just hope I just

1046.32 --> 1055.25
have hope I see something it is yeah

1056.48 --> 1063.0
maybe it is kind of like o to me in a

1060.48 --> 1067.2
way you could compare it metaphorically

1063.0 --> 1069.57
to old old Star Wars movie situations

1067.2 --> 1072.63
where just like no yeah he's on the dark

1069.57 --> 1075.72
sighs doing that but I feel there's

1072.63 --> 1079.3500000000001
something there that's the only way I

1075.72 --> 1084.1200000000001
can describe like when I see something

1079.35 --> 1089.6999999999998
in people like for example right and and

1084.12 --> 1093.12
others its ethereal it it's a sense how

1089.7 --> 1096.1200000000001
do you describe a sense you know that

1093.12 --> 1099.06
not everybody probably has or has turned

1096.12 --> 1102.2099999999998
on it's it's difficult to explain so you

1099.06 --> 1104.79
can only grab metaphors and feeling

1102.21 --> 1108.42
based sensation based descriptions or

1104.79 --> 1121.32
depictions so that is kind of what it

1108.42 --> 1123.6000000000001
feels like what Tom Parker yeah well the

1121.32 --> 1125.97
debate him about what you know and what

1123.6 --> 1130.1699999999998
arguments are you gonna bring Nathan is

1125.97 --> 1133.38
just a is a pretty hardcore bottom line

1130.17 --> 1136.8000000000002
guy and he's just you know if he if he

1133.38 --> 1139.3200000000002
has a good argument then he really even

1136.8 --> 1141.18
is willing to discard all the extra

1139.32 --> 1144.1799999999998
information all the little trinkets we

1141.18 --> 1147.54
can look at during the process just to

1144.18 --> 1149.67
get that immediate win so he sometimes

1147.54 --> 1153.99
he's liking and willing wound and to let

1149.67 --> 1156.93
people run their [ __ ] just to get

1153.99 --> 1160.5
that on a record and to later pick it

1156.93 --> 1162.78
apart but yeah he's a pretty ruthless

1160.5 --> 1164.7
guy that's just the way he is he's

1162.78 --> 1166.92
pretty direct and open about it he's

1164.7 --> 1169.75
honest he's not trying to hide that he's

1166.92 --> 1172.48
not secretly doing that you know

1169.75 --> 1177.19
and people do still come on the panel to

1172.48 --> 1181.39
challenge him so it is what it is it's

1177.19 --> 1184.39
hey if you go there are you challenging

1181.39 --> 1185.2900000000002
yeah you know what to expect so what are

1184.39 --> 1187.18
you gonna do about it

1185.29 --> 1189.73
are you just then gonna do what

1187.18 --> 1193.45
everybody does and have the same result

1189.73 --> 1196.3
or are you gonna actually try to to

1193.45 --> 1201.43
truly figure a way out of it in your

1196.3 --> 1204.3999999999999
approach without basically yeah trying

1201.43 --> 1206.3500000000001
to trick the audience or doublethink

1204.4 --> 1207.76
your way through in some spots because

1206.35 --> 1212.08
that doesn't work we can see it

1207.76 --> 1214.6299999999999
everybody can see that [ __ ] just because

1212.08 --> 1216.25
you can more easily trick yourself

1214.63 --> 1220.3300000000002
doesn't mean that everybody will go

1216.25 --> 1223.42
along with that some people may but most

1220.33 --> 1226.9299999999998
people want so it doesn't work you got

1223.42 --> 1229.78
to actually address the questions and

1226.93 --> 1232.27
actually answer them quickly you know

1229.78 --> 1234.7
let the explanations come afterward just

1232.27 --> 1237.55
just first say yes or no whatever

1234.7 --> 1242.47
depending on the address the question

1237.55 --> 1244.6599999999999
get over the constant tendency to the

1242.47 --> 1247.09
straw man and red herring it's just

1244.66 --> 1252.49
unnecessary in there all the ballers all

1247.09 --> 1255.1899999999998
do it every time it's just wasting

1252.49 --> 1261.01
everybody's time just get over it and

1255.19 --> 1265.75
address the issues you know I can even

1261.01 --> 1267.73
do I can be a baller I can enact from

1265.75 --> 1270.82
that perspective and I've done that even

1267.73 --> 1274.06
for the fun of it for it and get my way

1270.82 --> 1280.33
through and even get a proper

1274.06 --> 1284.05
conversation with Nathan because I just

1280.33 --> 1287.47
know how to not accidentally claim

1284.05 --> 1289.84
things that I don't have proof of and I

1287.47 --> 1292.33
will be very exact as to the mechanisms

1289.84 --> 1294.78
and all of their uncertainties that are

1292.33 --> 1297.55
involved in what I'm talking about

1294.78 --> 1301.54
very carefully I'm very careful when I

1297.55 --> 1303.3999999999999
presuppose things just that is technical

1301.54 --> 1303.61
correctness that is the real thing that

1303.4 --> 1305.89
is

1303.61 --> 1308.86
what it really is if you just be honest

1305.89 --> 1313.8400000000001
about it then Nathan is will be inclined

1308.86 --> 1316.299
to go along much more and be much

1313.84 --> 1320.08
friendlier than well all the ballers

1316.299 --> 1322.87
have been seeing so far so that's just a

1320.08 --> 1325.57
little tip but yeah it's difficult it's

1322.87 --> 1328.54
difficult to really get over what you're

1325.57 --> 1330.85
used to doing and fooling yourself that

1328.54 --> 1333.01
part especially so I don't expect that

1330.85 --> 1336.2199999999998
ballers are actually gonna be able to

1333.01 --> 1339.669
adapt to this it's just just a piece of

1336.22 --> 1341.76
advice for 2020 we'll see what comes of

1339.669 --> 1341.76
it

1344.61 --> 1354.04
Nathan afraid of Jose no not really no

1348.85 --> 1359.29
and Jose has faced Nathan yes come on

1354.04 --> 1361.33
Nathan but I don't know Jose look Jose

1359.29 --> 1363.76
is a lot more sensitive guide and he's

1361.33 --> 1366.61
probably willing to admit as a public

1363.76 --> 1368.4
representation of himself and that just

1366.61 --> 1372.1599999999999
doesn't really work too well because

1368.4 --> 1376.0590000000002
Nathan does literally on purpose get on

1372.16 --> 1379.8600000000001
people's North he he attacks them very

1376.059 --> 1382.51
harshly for their tiny mistakes and yeah

1379.86 --> 1384.9099999999999
what Jose then did and he's done that

1382.51 --> 1388.0
multiple times is then start kind of

1384.91 --> 1389.14
like advertisement ROM passing in a very

1388.0 --> 1391.66
entertaining

1389.14 --> 1393.6100000000001
Jose like way I do find it kind of music

1391.66 --> 1395.95
but it is rum passing doesn't address

1393.61 --> 1399.0
what's being talked about and that's not

1395.95 --> 1403.8400000000001
really debating that's again it's

1399.0 --> 1406.99
diverting the the energies and putting

1403.84 --> 1408.73
it out in in some kind of output but it

1406.99 --> 1410.59
is effectively around passing so it's

1408.73 --> 1412.27
not yeah

1410.59 --> 1415.6299999999999
Nathan is not afraid of you he's just

1412.27 --> 1418.6
merciless and hey nobody should blame

1415.63 --> 1420.7800000000002
Jose for not being able to handle Nathan

1418.6 --> 1420.78
okay

1425.909 --> 1433.21
and those days already admitted that

1429.629 --> 1436.059
he's just doing it for the fun of it and

1433.21 --> 1438.6390000000001
he once he likes the social side a lot

1436.059 --> 1440.44
of the whole debate platform it's part

1438.639 --> 1442.6899999999998
of the reason why he's done it he said

1440.44 --> 1445.299
that and he's never been really a

1442.69 --> 1447.19
champion at the real technical details

1445.299 --> 1449.08
yeah he's admitted he has difficulties

1447.19 --> 1457.69
with it and can't really hold that

1449.08 --> 1459.82
against him no so but yeah that makes it

1457.69 --> 1462.73
very difficult to then get into a

1459.82 --> 1465.149
hardcore technical detail debates if

1462.73 --> 1467.6490000000001
it's not your best talent because yet

1465.149 --> 1470.7099999999998
referring to just talking about social

1467.649 --> 1472.36
things are just gonna be shoved off the

1470.71 --> 1474.659
table because that's what the Flat Earth

1472.36 --> 1489.389
debates not are really about concerning

1474.659 --> 1489.3890000000001
Glover's so I'll shut up right now

1493.11 --> 1496.11
god

1497.87 --> 1504.4599999999998
[Music]

1499.78 --> 1504.46
now Karen Cox now it's not a record

1504.64 --> 1513.1000000000001
now I've had like - 90 most of that

1510.35 --> 1513.1
would go away again

1528.73 --> 1532.38
are you talking about

1546.72 --> 1551.91
[Music]

1549.32 --> 1559.11
yeah well I'm not up for Brenda because

1551.91 --> 1563.1000000000001
friend has at Roane and just the way she

1559.11 --> 1565.85
entered chat as usual is just yeah she's

1563.1 --> 1568.32
in her own little triggered world and

1565.85 --> 1570.2099999999998
she's not willing to listen any to

1568.32 --> 1572.28
anyone she just wants to shove her

1570.21 --> 1575.309
little believe whirl out there to kind

1572.28 --> 1578.1299999999999
of get reading room for herself because

1575.309 --> 1580.35
she's stuck and I'm not willing to

1578.13 --> 1583.98
entertain that nonsense on the show not

1580.35 --> 1586.74
while I'm in the zone getting good

1583.98 --> 1589.17
points out don't want to get all basic

1586.74 --> 1592.829
it's just a waste of my time

1589.17 --> 1592.8290000000002
[Music]

1594.89 --> 1600.69
well why didn't you stop complaining

1597.87 --> 1604.6699999999998
about that nonsense you know I don't

1600.69 --> 1608.97
really care concerning Brenda about her

1604.67 --> 1613.14
[ __ ] sexual nature whatever whatever

1608.97 --> 1615.9
that is or a gender thing you know if

1613.14 --> 1620.19
she wants to be called a she that's fine

1615.9 --> 1622.3500000000001
I don't care I don't care what how she

1620.19 --> 1624.6000000000001
he whatever it was born I don't care it

1622.35 --> 1626.76
doesn't matter it's not relevant to the

1624.6 --> 1630.2099999999998
situation concerning what she actually

1626.76 --> 1633.77
does how she trolls people how dumb she

1630.21 --> 1638.25
freakin is how riddled with just

1633.77 --> 1640.8
corruption and double think she is you

1638.25 --> 1644.34
know I find that much more worthy of

1640.8 --> 1647.48
emphasis than wool she's yeah she was

1644.34 --> 1647.48
tricked by the system

1665.91 --> 1673.74
ya know Brenda typically does refuse to

1669.0 --> 1676.53
listen Wow

1673.74 --> 1679.83
Oh Karen Cox that's gonna be very

1676.53 --> 1686.04
difficult because I have to transsexual

1679.83 --> 1690.6599999999999
friends here in the Netherlands so yeah

1686.04 --> 1693.27
I do talk about them sometimes not about

1690.66 --> 1695.8500000000001
their transsexuality although I might

1693.27 --> 1698.16
relate like how they feel about it or

1695.85 --> 1702.12
what it's been like to them or whatever

1698.16 --> 1705.66
if it becomes relevant but you know the

1702.12 --> 1707.61
thing is I'm not a person that typically

1705.66 --> 1711.5400000000002
wants to always attack these people

1707.61 --> 1713.8799999999999
absolutely not now I'm actually I've

1711.54 --> 1717.27
dealt with him before in the gothic

1713.88 --> 1721.23
scene met some like yeah a long time ago

1717.27 --> 1724.65
so I kind of like figured it out what

1721.23 --> 1730.6100000000001
that is from a feeling I kind of got

1724.65 --> 1730.6100000000001
used to that I guess you know

1730.75 --> 1736.09
I just don't have a direct problem with

1733.179 --> 1739.39
it but I do regard it as I reflected

1736.09 --> 1744.28
upon myself like yeah doing that is a

1739.39 --> 1747.51
mistake that's how that's my opinion but

1744.28 --> 1750.58
I'm not gonna be like oh you need to

1747.51 --> 1753.28
accept maybe with children but yeah then

1750.58 --> 1757.12
again it's up to the parents and yeah

1753.28 --> 1760.86
what are you doing you know but you yeah

1757.12 --> 1764.25
I can just share my opinions about it I

1760.86 --> 1768.01
it's no use just getting out there with

1764.25 --> 1771.24
with billboards like oh we have to stop

1768.01 --> 1775.74
it because these people that do that

1771.24 --> 1775.74
they're just gonna get more pushy I

1777.0 --> 1782.34
think it just it's no use

1785.37 --> 1792.3999999999999
the best way to approach all of it is to

1789.15 --> 1795.49
give all of the people some way an

1792.4 --> 1798.909
alternative something to escape this

1795.49 --> 1802.21
pressure that may may make them go over

1798.909 --> 1807.19
the edge and like do one of these crazy

1802.21 --> 1810.669
things to their kids or whatever allow

1807.19 --> 1811.23
things to happen in order to go along to

1810.669 --> 1815.47
get along

1811.23 --> 1819.3700000000001
just give them some other way so they

1815.47 --> 1821.409
can sidestep that and prevent inflicting

1819.37 --> 1827.53
damage upon themselves and their

1821.409 --> 1829.2700000000002
families but that yeah they have to find

1827.53 --> 1831.01
it and then they have to decide that

1829.27 --> 1834.07
they have to learn about it's the only

1831.01 --> 1840.61
way you can't make these people stop

1834.07 --> 1843.58
doing that they have to figure it out

1840.61 --> 1846.25
they have to have an alternative

1843.58 --> 1848.289
that's why free speech also is so

1846.25 --> 1850.809
important because people have to make up

1848.289 --> 1853.559
their own minds they have to really hear

1850.809 --> 1853.559
all the angles

1856.77 --> 1859.8899999999999
[Music]

1872.94 --> 1880.979
all right well Martin Ellen transgender

1877.44 --> 1884.159
Goths now I'm afraid well the concept

1880.979 --> 1888.299
was out there it's like people just

1884.159 --> 1892.3790000000001
saying no I am a woman in spirit for

1888.299 --> 1894.629
example when they were guys and then it

1892.379 --> 1898.4399999999998
would be more like they would have had

1894.629 --> 1904.889
any surgery or anything it's just like

1898.44 --> 1915.6490000000001
that that's existed for some time it was

1904.889 --> 1915.649
very confusing at times hey razzy

1925.88 --> 1944.009
[Music]

1927.799 --> 1947.009
so yeah I do have yeah liberal sides to

1944.009 --> 1949.6490000000001
me I'm just used to some of it doesn't

1947.009 --> 1954.21
mean that I am like oh yeah let's

1949.649 --> 1959.4889999999998
support no it's just like I kind of get

1954.21 --> 1961.409
it I don't have a big personal problem

1959.489 --> 1963.059
with it what I do have a big personal

1961.409 --> 1967.5590000000002
problem that's well known right now is

1963.059 --> 1970.46
yeah people that like to fool around

1967.559 --> 1973.379
with little kids that's something I

1970.46 --> 1976.769
never been it there's always instinctive

1973.379 --> 1978.9289999999999
just takes over and it's just like no

1976.769 --> 1983.729
way that's gonna happen while I'm

1978.929 --> 1985.679
conscious of it like that but yeah that

1983.729 --> 1988.919
haven't been confronted with that thank

1985.679 --> 1991.429
God in the car scene who would have been

1988.919 --> 1991.429
terrible

1993.169 --> 2005.1390000000001
nothing that would directly indicate

1995.399 --> 2009.9499999999998
such things but I have met a lot of like

2005.139 --> 2012.2589999999998
like goth people or didn't really get to

2009.95 --> 2016.3690000000001
know them but just good by hearing them

2012.259 --> 2018.679
talking like some people out there are

2016.369 --> 2020.779
just really creepy inside and they are

2018.679 --> 2023.69
like they like to fantasize about

2020.779 --> 2026.269
torturing kids and [ __ ] and I'm pretty

2023.69 --> 2029.989
certain those people never really do

2026.269 --> 2033.679
that but still they just fantasize about

2029.989 --> 2035.239
that pretty roughly and then other

2033.679 --> 2037.97
people are just listening in like oh

2035.239 --> 2041.3890000000001
yeah yeah and I'm like what the [ __ ]

2037.97 --> 2043.82
that that's something that shocked me

2041.389 --> 2046.82
plenty of times or not too many times

2043.82 --> 2051.369
thank God but still happen every now and

2046.82 --> 2053.659
then in like gothic parties or something

2051.369 --> 2056.179
but yeah

2053.659 --> 2058.759
it all depends also on the location I

2056.179 --> 2061.2200000000003
guess and yeah it is disgusting but it's

2058.759 --> 2063.319
even outside of the goth scene I've been

2061.22 --> 2066.859
yeah confronted with those types of

2063.319 --> 2069.44
situation like for example in the D&D

2066.859 --> 2071.899
circle that I kind of helped built here

2069.44 --> 2074.259
I'm now left with the one D&D group

2071.899 --> 2077.179
pretty much that I stuck to because I

2074.259 --> 2079.099
kind of monotone I just like to stick to

2077.179 --> 2081.5
one group but there's other people and

2079.099 --> 2084.679
we had this kind of gathering habit

2081.5 --> 2086.45
through Meetup and then yeah

2084.679 --> 2088.46
it's like oh you want to learn about D&D

2086.45 --> 2091.819
maybe join a group maybe form a group

2088.46 --> 2097.43
well let's meet up and talk one time I

2091.819 --> 2099.109
did that this guy that I never met and

2097.43 --> 2101.39
was like um there were a lot of people

2099.109 --> 2104.99
and just started talking away I hate you

2101.39 --> 2106.549
know so the kill them all then I was

2104.99 --> 2109.97
like what the [ __ ]

2106.549 --> 2112.21
so I literally stepped up like stood up

2109.97 --> 2115.6699999999996
like what did you say

2112.21 --> 2118.609
you're not gonna say that [ __ ] in front

2115.67 --> 2121.25
of me I like it really live it no no

2118.609 --> 2123.89
physical violence but I was like you

2121.25 --> 2125.839
will not do that and anybody that will

2123.89 --> 2130.3689999999997
oppose it is gonna have a problem with

2125.839 --> 2133.3089999999997
me and I'm not gonna drop it and yet so

2130.369 --> 2140.029
it's not big all seen specific no it's

2133.309 --> 2143.96
just people especially like late teens

2140.029 --> 2151.009
or early 20s type that never really hurt

2143.96 --> 2153.17
people like over 30 do that but it

2151.009 --> 2155.63
creeps me out every time and just my

2153.17 --> 2159.289
instinct I just have to do that pissed

2155.63 --> 2165.799
off and in weird other things like one

2159.289 --> 2169.039
time I was yeah there was a D&D meeting

2165.799 --> 2170.66
in a cafe that was still there and it's

2169.039 --> 2175.7000000000003
gone now it's too bad it was a really

2170.66 --> 2179.0589999999997
nice place but yeah on the way I was on

2175.7 --> 2181.64
a bike and I was just looking at a park

2179.059 --> 2183.65
and there was there were like kids

2181.64 --> 2186.2
playing and somebody's dog kind of got

2183.65 --> 2186.6600000000003
loose it was a pretty big damn dog and

2186.2 --> 2188.819
it

2186.66 --> 2192.569
then proceeded to attack these kids and

2188.819 --> 2193.71
we're like eight-year-olds and I was

2192.569 --> 2196.44
like what the [ __ ]

2193.71 --> 2199.98
so I immediately just stepped like

2196.44 --> 2202.14
jumped off my bike ran towards it and

2199.98 --> 2204.2690000000002
got in front of it like and distracted

2202.14 --> 2205.17
the dog like I have boots you know I got

2204.269 --> 2207.5089999999996
freakin booth

2205.17 --> 2211.009
those are good defensive tools against

2207.509 --> 2213.93
dog teeth and it wasn't like really

2211.009 --> 2216.48
rapidly like killer mode but he was

2213.93 --> 2219.299
getting rough so I just distracted the

2216.48 --> 2221.069
creature in order for the yeah for kids

2219.299 --> 2224.25
getting away and then I talked about

2221.069 --> 2227.97
that [ __ ] when I got to the to the group

2224.25 --> 2230.46
and they actually responded to me like

2227.97 --> 2235.68
huh you should have just let let the dog

2230.46 --> 2239.549
kill the kid like dude you did not just

2235.68 --> 2242.549
say that to my face buddy they're like

2239.549 --> 2245.5389999999998
what the [ __ ] is wrong with you why

2242.549 --> 2252.96
would you say something but what are you

2245.539 --> 2257.279
that do you think that's a game that's I

2252.96 --> 2260.15
just don't get some people and it's out

2257.279 --> 2260.15
there that [ __ ]

2264.31 --> 2267.42
[Music]

2269.67 --> 2272.88
[Music]

2277.229 --> 2283.299
so yeah that those are some things

2280.14 --> 2285.67
happens sometimes but the culture that I

2283.299 --> 2290.619
get confronted with and just creeps me

2285.67 --> 2293.319
up that that I seem to be the only one

2290.619 --> 2295.1800000000003
just stepping up and saying stop that

2293.319 --> 2297.569
that's insane

2295.18 --> 2303.91
[Music]

2297.569 --> 2307.449
now don't don't let somebody do man yeah

2303.91 --> 2310.269
get maniacal inside it just stop them

2307.449 --> 2312.989
help them stop to it it's not something

2310.269 --> 2315.9889999999996
that is normal it should never be normal

2312.989 --> 2315.989
anyway

2324.299 --> 2334.449
right so yeah but yeah most of the yeah

2331.929 --> 2338.4990000000003
it's not the Gaussian specifically it's

2334.449 --> 2341.439
just I guess it's the combination of

2338.499 --> 2344.229
that indigo see there is kind of among

2341.439 --> 2346.239
some circles at least there was I don't

2344.229 --> 2348.3689999999997
know I don't know the golf scene anymore

2346.239 --> 2352.2690000000002
you know I haven't done anything in

2348.369 --> 2355.059
every years at least five years fountain

2352.269 --> 2357.0989999999997
I don't know and even in the last few

2355.059 --> 2361.299
years it was already kind of different

2357.099 --> 2363.489
it's like ten years before that so but

2361.299 --> 2366.869
at the time especially when I got into

2363.489 --> 2370.389
it there was just this thing about

2366.869 --> 2375.429
bragging about being evil like kind of a

2370.389 --> 2378.489
LARP II thing and yet that got freaky

2375.429 --> 2380.9790000000003
because I said before sometimes it could

2378.489 --> 2383.859
turn out that potentially somebody

2380.979 --> 2386.709
actually meant it even though I thought

2383.859 --> 2390.159
it was just being like LARP like being

2386.709 --> 2392.379
evil signaling who is cool goth or we're

2390.159 --> 2397.329
so we're so dark it's it's really

2392.379 --> 2400.659
childish yeah it's just I I was a bit of

2397.329 --> 2403.539
a fantasy stand I kind of liked the idea

2400.659 --> 2407.319
I thought the brooding darkness was kind

2403.539 --> 2409.2690000000002
of fascinating I don't anymore I've seen

2407.319 --> 2413.049
achieving enough of it you know I know

2409.269 --> 2417.4889999999996
what it is now I just there's no more

2413.049 --> 2420.009
purpose for it for me really although

2417.489 --> 2423.069
yeah in between all of that there has

2420.009 --> 2428.399
been some very interesting music not all

2423.069 --> 2428.399
of it dark necessarily so anyway

2431.22 --> 2435.9399999999996
so I'm gonna address chat for a moment

2433.99 --> 2445.7799999999997

2751.95 --> 2755.16
[Music]

2756.53 --> 2764.8100000000004
yeah oh by the way yeah I've run out of

2760.85 --> 2769.13
Star Trek next generation yes I did like

2764.81 --> 2772.7599999999998
I ran out like two days ago already and

2769.13 --> 2774.9500000000003
like I'm missing it but maybe I've had

2772.76 --> 2777.5
enough Star Trek for a while I've been

2774.95 --> 2782.5699999999997
just digging through some other just

2777.5 --> 2796.97
movies and I found this fascinating

2782.57 --> 2799.4900000000002
little movie called yes-men from I don't

2796.97 --> 2804.7599999999998
know why I'm forgetting his name what

2799.49 --> 2804.7599999999998
the same guy from the Truman Show hey

2813.66 --> 2820.45
Wow it just

2816.77 --> 2822.92
Jim Carrey that's right right right

2820.45 --> 2824.93
don't know why I forgot that name it's

2822.92 --> 2827.869
that definitely an easy to remember name

2824.93 --> 2831.56
that just couldn't get it weird but

2827.869 --> 2835.4900000000002
anyway Jim Carrey starred in that and it

2831.56 --> 2839.2999999999997
was a like a psychological concept movie

2835.49 --> 2844.4799999999996
and it was very fascinating I thought it

2839.3 --> 2847.13
was just fascinating and pretty

2844.48 --> 2849.38
compelling like the characters were very

2847.13 --> 2852.8
compelling in the whole thing I thought

2849.38 --> 2854.839
it was hilarious in any way a movie I

2852.8 --> 2856.79
definitely recommend for everyone seeing

2854.839 --> 2861.41
I think somebody recommended this to me

2856.79 --> 2865.22
a long time ago is it's not it's not

2861.41 --> 2869.5299999999997
super old but yeah it was a Netflix I

2865.22 --> 2869.5299999999997
watch it it was just awesome I loved it

2873.46 --> 2879.369
and it was a bit over the top in ways

2876.89 --> 2888.23
but that was interesting it was just a

2879.369 --> 2890.089
fascinating concept and it I did find it

2888.23 --> 2892.43
compelling because it addressed issues

2890.089 --> 2895.82
the entire movie was just addressing

2892.43 --> 2899.4199999999996
issues about kind of pacified passivity

2895.82 --> 2904.369
and that is a problem that I have so it

2899.42 --> 2906.29
was like oh wow yeah I am almost

2904.369 --> 2908.96
inclined to start doing that but I'm not

2906.29 --> 2911.48
gonna do that because not literally I

2908.96 --> 2913.369
already in a way try to do that but

2911.48 --> 2914.869
that's the interesting part there like

2913.369 --> 2917.9300000000003
in the last part of the movie

2914.869 --> 2922.25
I'll not literally spoil it they they do

2917.93 --> 2925.609
kind of say like there's some more fight

2922.25 --> 2929.089
- an approach to the concept what is

2925.609 --> 2931.04
being done and I agree today I thought

2929.089 --> 2932.869
it was just a very interesting movie I'm

2931.04 --> 2936.08
probably gonna watch it again not too

2932.869 --> 2939.4700000000003
long with a while but anyway I saw that

2936.08 --> 2941.27
on Netflix and I got another Adam

2939.47 --> 2945.98
Sandler movie that I'm kind of gonna

2941.27 --> 2947.869
watch just it looks pretty goofy with a

2945.98 --> 2950.2
lot of CGI I don't know what's gonna be

2947.869 --> 2953.88
but yeah

2950.2 --> 2953.8799999999997
that happened also

2982.45 --> 2986.0989999999997
what are you talking about

3005.32 --> 3011.73
yeah yeah he had your chance fir'd yeah

3008.11 --> 3014.53
I do appreciate you Meharry has had some

3011.73 --> 3019.9900000000002
controversial things some psychological

3014.53 --> 3026.2200000000003
issues in a way but I think he's a

3019.99 --> 3029.8599999999997
fascinating person and he has so much

3026.22 --> 3032.62
facial control it's just it's inspiring

3029.86 --> 3037.02
to me because I try to have a bit of

3032.62 --> 3037.02
facial control but he is a master

3053.6 --> 3058.39
yeah and he does say profound things

3055.91 --> 3058.39
indeed

3084.51 --> 3090.5600000000004
Wow Gideon's sick really doesn't like

3086.94 --> 3090.56
Jim Carrey apparently

3102.89 --> 3111.95
now Truman show was awesome but to be

3106.61 --> 3114.56
fair I I think every movie to be honest

3111.95 --> 3118.6699999999996
I think every movies ever been in is

3114.56 --> 3121.16
just interesting that isn't always great

3118.67 --> 3122.51
but it's at least interesting it's just

3121.16 --> 3124.8999999999996
when he's there it's always interesting

3122.51 --> 3129.8300000000004
like even the movie like Dumb and Dumber

3124.9 --> 3135.38
was like really lame in a way like on

3129.83 --> 3137.21
purpose but still he did yeah maybe

3135.38 --> 3141.32
that's like one of the least movies but

3137.21 --> 3143.7200000000003
he's always putting so much character in

3141.32 --> 3146.69
there he's always becoming whatever he's

3143.72 --> 3149.1499999999996
acting for real with like a lot of manic

3146.69 --> 3153.5
energy and all that and just always

3149.15 --> 3155.84
interesting to me you know and other

3153.5 --> 3159.44
people just made simply not be able to

3155.84 --> 3162.05
stand people that act like that

3159.44 --> 3164.33
literally whether it's an act or they're

3162.05 --> 3166.1000000000004
actually like that they don't like that

3164.33 --> 3169.5099999999998
intense energy maybe and then they think

3166.1 --> 3173.47
he's just annoying and distracting and

3169.51 --> 3178.09
but no I like him I think he's very

3173.47 --> 3183.41
interesting very talented and he's just

3178.09 --> 3185.81
so great at acting itself well it will

3183.41 --> 3188.2999999999997
always typically seek out certain type

3185.81 --> 3192.2
of characteristics it's gonna tune it to

3188.3 --> 3196.5800000000004
his own carry his own ability range its

3192.2 --> 3200.41
own personal person so it's always going

3196.58 --> 3200.41
to be like Jim Carrey of course in a way

3213.82 --> 3229.2400000000002
what Kevin Cox really are you serious he

3220.96 --> 3231.25
paints pictures of Jesus now what does

3229.24 --> 3234.1299999999997
that a joke is that for you I don't know

3231.25 --> 3236.47
say I have no it look I am NOT a fanboy

3234.13 --> 3239.02
in sense that I don't keep track what

3236.47 --> 3243.1899999999996
Jim Carrey is doing it's just that time

3239.02 --> 3246.7
I see him I do look into it do tend to

3243.19 --> 3249.79
click on if I can movies that I haven't

3246.7 --> 3251.4399999999996
seen where he appears to be in it I'm

3249.79 --> 3262.71
not gonna keep track of what he's doing

3251.44 --> 3265.71
with this personal life too much ok atm

3262.71 --> 3265.71
yeah

3272.95 --> 3285.22
well she shouldn't he should he not

3277.39 --> 3287.77
point out what that is the difference

3285.22 --> 3291.0099999999998
between being awoken and being asleep

3287.77 --> 3293.53
sheep he does that pretty well now

3291.01 --> 3297.6000000000004
doesn't he does that make him a satanic

3293.53 --> 3297.6000000000004
wizard really a gem

3307.75 --> 3310.47
what

3315.609 --> 3325.869
oh yeah what now gideon sacred you

3322.69 --> 3329.589
started - why would you say Jim DMT

3325.869 --> 3331.719
Carrie that seemed like an attack okay

3329.589 --> 3343.9
but apparently you do love him weird

3331.719 --> 3351.609
why'd you would you call anyone that an

3343.9 --> 3355.529
occultist well probably if he would be

3351.609 --> 3355.529
he'd probably be that out of boredom

3365.76 --> 3376.01
well getting sick DMT being great no

3372.59 --> 3379.56
it's it's not as simple as that

3376.01 --> 3382.32
DMT is has a lot of effects a lot of

3379.56 --> 3384.77
influences and you gotta be careful with

3382.32 --> 3384.77
that [ __ ]

3396.08 --> 3402.52
I know nothing okay okay getting sick

3406.89 --> 3410.4
[Music]

3414.94 --> 3421.93
yeah I've had experiences too with that

3418.2 --> 3424.75
on the not identified EMT it was

3421.93 --> 3426.43
ayahuasca though in retrospect even you

3424.75 --> 3431.74
know what was happening to me at the

3426.43 --> 3436.569
time but yeah it's pretty rough left a

3431.74 --> 3438.609
lot of scars in a way that I didn't on

3436.569 --> 3441.7599999999998
my mind basically that I have managed to

3438.609 --> 3442.69
restore but totally different it's

3441.76 --> 3454.2400000000002
totally different

3442.69 --> 3456.64
okay it's totally different sure so if

3454.24 --> 3458.6189999999997
it's so totally different you tell me

3456.64 --> 3462.3089999999997
what is it what does it do that it's so

3458.619 --> 3464.109
totally different doesn't it's all good

3462.309 --> 3472.8900000000003
apparently according to getting sick

3464.109 --> 3472.89
here free base dnt what

3475.24 --> 3480.1499999999996
I don't even know what that means

3504.869 --> 3508.13
to westernize

3512.12 --> 3517.77
okay sure are getting sick I don't know

3515.97 --> 3521.7599999999998
I've never heard about that I don't even

3517.77 --> 3523.74
know if that's legal in here in

3521.76 --> 3533.34
Netherlands I don't know maybe it is

3523.74 --> 3536.6299999999997
it's just before I even be inclined to

3533.34 --> 3539.4300000000003
try that I need to hear a lot more about

3536.63 --> 3543.03
it and I don't want to talk about that

3539.43 --> 3545.79
on my show because I generally just

3543.03 --> 3548.0400000000004
don't want to encourage people to take

3545.79 --> 3549.63
psychotropics you know if they're gonna

3548.04 --> 3553.7
do it they're gonna do it anyway but I

3549.63 --> 3556.26
just don't want to say yeah so good

3553.7 --> 3560.75
every time somebody does it does that in

3556.26 --> 3564.21
public I I just get immediate doubts

3560.75 --> 3568.82
about those individuals but they're more

3564.21 --> 3568.82
roll awareness

3582.27 --> 3595.08
okay okay kid you didn't see you mean

3589.8 --> 3606.9300000000003
ceremony I don't think that cero

3595.08 --> 3608.73
mommy is a word please yeah no it's all

3606.93 --> 3610.7999999999997
very nice it's well this guy's

3608.73 --> 3611.34
apparently completely loose in all that

3610.8 --> 3616.5800000000004
[ __ ]

3611.34 --> 3622.44
yeah I've my experience have not been

3616.58 --> 3626.04
great I had some extreme stream

3622.44 --> 3629.3
experiences and seen just things that I

3626.04 --> 3629.3
wish I'd never seen

3643.84 --> 3646.4700000000003
what

3647.52 --> 3650.71
[Music]

3668.14 --> 3677.69
right Jennison well that is a conclusion

3674.39 --> 3679.759
that I've also drawn it's even they I've

3677.69 --> 3682.699
talked about all that's all this stuff

3679.759 --> 3685.4
sparingly before on shows and everything

3682.699 --> 3689.059
and that's exactly what I said

3685.4 --> 3691.67
like be very careful who you pick to do

3689.059 --> 3698.3590000000004
this stuff with because I made some poor

3691.67 --> 3703.789
choices with some pretty brutal

3698.359 --> 3706.969
consequence of psychologically and I'm

3703.789 --> 3710.8900000000003
just not really eager to engage in

3706.969 --> 3710.89
anything like that ever again unless

3712.329 --> 3720.619
yeah I get a calling from the inside and

3715.88 --> 3723.049
it's just too too compelling just to

3720.619 --> 3726.849
ignore I don't know but it's nothing

3723.049 --> 3726.849
like that in me right now

3734.64 --> 3741.859
would be good if we could reboot our

3737.609 --> 3745.89
brains well there are some I think that

3741.859 --> 3747.839
it can be therapeutically adapted even

3745.89 --> 3751.19
with ayahuasca I've read articles about

3747.839 --> 3754.529
this and I do find them kind of sensible

3751.19 --> 3758.16
that ayahuasca could be used like even

3754.529 --> 3762.9
new earth talks about this at times that

3758.16 --> 3767.18
can be used to kind of get bad habits

3762.9 --> 3771.779
out of your system very quickly like to

3767.18 --> 3776.1189999999997
re recrystallize the energy structures

3771.779 --> 3779.279
that that the Spirit is very easily and

3776.119 --> 3786.7490000000003
therefore change yourself in ways like

3779.279 --> 3791.18
that yeah but that's to me sounds very

3786.749 --> 3795.2389999999996
easy idealistic because I've experienced

3791.18 --> 3797.549
things among what I've experienced that

3795.239 --> 3800.339
part as well as very fascinating to me

3797.549 --> 3804.66
and interesting and I made weird choices

3800.339 --> 3808.17
at it but hey I am the way I am right

3804.66 --> 3812.0589999999997
now and but yeah on top of that there

3808.17 --> 3817.079
were just a lot more time also spent

3812.059 --> 3818.67
just with with really tough and painful

3817.079 --> 3827.549
things that didn't even literally

3818.67 --> 3830.279
concern me personally and I got things

3827.549 --> 3834.769
shoved in my face other people's

3830.279 --> 3837.869
experiences as well it's just crazy and

3834.769 --> 3839.7
scarring mentally scarring is just still

3837.869 --> 3843.089
a lot of things that I've seen that I

3839.7 --> 3844.68
literally actively try to avoid thinking

3843.089 --> 3847.17
about because every time I do I get

3844.68 --> 3851.3289999999997
pulled back into the darkness it's kind

3847.17 --> 3851.329
of what what the entities did to me

3856.09 --> 3861.71
but yeah I'm doing pretty good now I'm

3860.0 --> 3864.89
so much stronger than five years ago

3861.71 --> 3868.69
when really when that that door opened

3864.89 --> 3871.2799999999997
up back into remembering all the vision

3868.69 --> 3873.92
because when I first came out of it I

3871.28 --> 3876.71
just I I don't know how it worked but

3873.92 --> 3879.7400000000002
right before I step back into normal

3876.71 --> 3882.23
linear conscious I talked with some

3879.74 --> 3883.3999999999996
other people or beings or anything I

3882.23 --> 3886.64
didn't know I think there were people

3883.4 --> 3889.07
and a stunt like this I'm going to like

3886.64 --> 3892.04
my head's gonna explode as soon as I

3889.07 --> 3892.9100000000003
wake up from the stress so some I just

3892.04 --> 3900.35
can't handle this

3892.91 --> 3902.72
I gotta forget most of it because I

3900.35 --> 3906.68
experienced like what seemed like 80

3902.72 --> 3909.77
years of crazy [ __ ] things that it that

3906.68 --> 3913.8399999999997
wouldn't kind of ruin having knowledge

3909.77 --> 3917.72
of that would ruin my life experience

3913.84 --> 3922.4300000000003
and that may also be tied in as I

3917.72 --> 3925.0099999999998
described the amnesia but yeah and then

3922.43 --> 3930.3799999999997
roughly five years ago suddenly the door

3925.01 --> 3932.3
got opened and this memories start to

3930.38 --> 3934.28
come back and then was very puzzled like

3932.3 --> 3937.13
what is this is this even real as this

3934.28 --> 3938.9
physically realized is not and yeah that

3937.13 --> 3941.75
was a big mystery to me back then and

3938.9 --> 3942.53
the visions but I'd know a lot more

3941.75 --> 3945.109
about it right now

3942.53 --> 3946.88
I've gotten used to it figure it out

3945.109 --> 3949.6
even what the purpose of some of these

3946.88 --> 3949.6
visions were

3952.95 --> 3956.5789999999997
overthinking oh really

3970.88 --> 3973.57
juice

3975.25 --> 3978.4
[Music]

3984.14 --> 3990.3089999999997
might want to tone down that a little

3986.719 --> 3990.309
bit please

3999.08 --> 4008.169
[Music]

4012.32 --> 4016.699
[Music]

4035.31 --> 4040.15
and now Ian Adams it's a complicated

4038.74 --> 4043.87
question I don't think that anxiety

4040.15 --> 4047.02
always leads to dementia no I think it

4043.87 --> 4049.81
is if people kind of like make conscious

4047.02 --> 4053.23
decisions to just not care about

4049.81 --> 4057.7599999999998
something anymore or drop entire

4053.23 --> 4061.08
scenarios from their memory just like

4057.76 --> 4064.09
actively ignore all of that that that

4061.08 --> 4067.42
may water down the actual energy

4064.09 --> 4070.21
connections with the world and that that

4067.42 --> 4076.21
may kind of lead to this if you don't

4070.21 --> 4079.7200000000003
use it it's gonna just wither so I think

4076.21 --> 4082.06
that active ignorance causes dementia on

4079.72 --> 4085.3599999999997
the long run not so much anxiety but

4082.06 --> 4089.67
anxiety can lead to more easily deciding

4085.36 --> 4089.67
to just avoid things so

4096.88 --> 4103.27
all right I'm gonna round out the show

4098.67 --> 4105.1
so if you like this one please don't

4103.27 --> 4106.780000000001
