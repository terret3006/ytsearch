301.52 --> 307.19899999999996
lot i think

uh because i did my groceries then

307.199 --> 310.88
because i didn't do it in the morning

308.479 --> 312.71999999999997
this time i did it in the morning

310.88 --> 315.039
and after that yeah i kind of started

312.72 --> 316.40000000000003
watching alex jones to see what he was

315.039 --> 318.32
up to

316.4 --> 320.08

we've been

348.479 --> 355.59999999999997

359.199 --> 363.52000000000004

that

364.72 --> 368.47900000000004
and but because of that i completely

499.599 --> 504.71999999999997
new york right right yeah welcome to the

504.84 --> 507.84
stream

515.68 --> 521.8389999999999
lilies what what does that mean

530.24 --> 536.16
hey zeptappy mark sargent is a sell-out

536.32 --> 541.44
oh right yeah a nice guy's lighting

540.48 --> 544.24
attempt there that's

541.44 --> 544.24
really pathetic

546.16 --> 552.56
no he didn't i saw it it's just fooling

548.72 --> 552.5600000000001
around it's it's advertisement

552.959 --> 558.399
sheesh this is ridic how are you gonna

557.2 --> 560.839
call that a sellout

558.399 --> 563.44
how did it break what he's doing it

560.839 --> 566.5600000000001
didn't he's always been like that

563.44 --> 567.839
he he is screwing around like that on

566.56 --> 572.2399999999999
his own shows he's

567.839 --> 574.1600000000001
that's just his this is humor

572.24 --> 577.839
that's really sad dude that's not

574.16 --> 577.8389999999999
selling out

580.399 --> 584.64
and besides he's right you know a lot of

582.88 --> 587.4399999999999
flat earthers are kind of crazy

584.64 --> 591.76
i'm kind of crazy but yeah compared to

587.44 --> 593.36
some ballers out there we're like

591.76 --> 595.76
i don't know the pinnacle of

593.36 --> 599.2
civilization

595.76 --> 602.24
you know so a lot of people

599.2 --> 605.279
especially in this age it's really

602.24 --> 607.519
difficult not to become crazy somehow

605.279 --> 608.48
so it's all a matter of perspective at

607.519 --> 610.8
it

608.48 --> 610.8000000000001
you know

616.72 --> 622.9590000000001
commercials smears oh i'm so

620.16 --> 625.76
i'm so horrified seft happy i'm sure

622.959 --> 628.2399999999999
that the commercial

625.76 --> 629.68
hasn't brought attention to flat earth

628.24 --> 633.04
at all

629.68 --> 636.16
right not at all it

633.04 --> 640.3199999999999
it it only makes

636.16 --> 642.079
people hate flat earthers more right

640.32 --> 643.6800000000001
or think they're more stupid because

642.079 --> 646.0
you're gonna take that literal

643.68 --> 647.92
since he's presenting himself as the

646.0 --> 650.079
flat earth guy and yeah he calls flat

647.92 --> 654.64
earthers crazy oh

650.079 --> 654.64
that's yeah

658.839 --> 663.6800000000001
no

661.36 --> 664.399
and besides one of his main strategies

663.68 --> 667.4399999999999
he almost

664.399 --> 670.88
invented it publicly well not in he

667.44 --> 672.8800000000001
invented it for himself and shared that

670.88 --> 675.4399999999999
and that is that any attention is good

672.88 --> 678.079
attention when it comes to flat earth

675.44 --> 679.6800000000001
because it is so triggering so it

678.079 --> 681.519
doesn't really matter how it is

679.68 --> 683.279
presented it is going to trigger some

681.519 --> 685.519
people to

683.279 --> 686.8
get entangled with it in some way

685.519 --> 690.399
whether they

686.8 --> 692.7199999999999
double down against it that still means

690.399 --> 695.12
that they kind of reach towards it

692.72 --> 698.48
or if they're just like hey what is this

695.12 --> 698.48
why is this being brought up

699.44 --> 704.1600000000001
maybe should take a peek at what's going

702.0 --> 704.16
on

713.279 --> 719.92
yeah that's [ __ ]

717.76 --> 723.36
kind of man if he said that he said that

719.92 --> 725.519
in in like one of his sarcastic roles

723.36 --> 727.6800000000001
because as i said he has pretty nutty

725.519 --> 728.8
humor and sometimes i think it goes too

727.68 --> 730.88
far

728.8 --> 732.8
but it has more to do with i don't know

730.88 --> 735.519
some kind of

732.8 --> 736.0
remnant of bipolar or something but it's

735.519 --> 740.0
just

736.0 --> 743.2
that's he does that

740.0 --> 745.6
it's that's all it's yeah he goes some

743.2 --> 746.48
too far some he doesn't literally mean

745.6 --> 748.24
that you're

746.48 --> 750.9590000000001
you're sharing it like it's some

748.24 --> 754.16
political statement that he did that

750.959 --> 755.4399999999999
low the guy jokes around a lot do you

754.16 --> 760.56
really think he's gonna like

755.44 --> 760.5600000000001
officially declare that you're nuts

764.079 --> 773.8389999999999
hey flat soy yeah welcome back

787.6 --> 790.48
yeah that's right

791.2 --> 794.48
i don't know what mike was

794.88 --> 800.079
but there were all kinds of issues with

796.88 --> 804.32
the guy a lot

800.079 --> 806.2399999999999
yeah he was as an attention grabby stunt

804.32 --> 809.279
guy

806.24 --> 811.839
and yeah it happened

809.279 --> 812.399
whatever mark sergeant has said he said

811.839 --> 815.2790000000001
it to

812.399 --> 815.839
trigger joke the [ __ ] out of the place

815.279 --> 818.16
if he

815.839 --> 820.0790000000001
actually did say that and i'm pretty

818.16 --> 822.24
sure that in retrospect

820.079 --> 823.92
he would then apologize and probably

822.24 --> 825.44
make the same joke again because

823.92 --> 827.04
that's the sort of thing that he does

825.44 --> 829.6
when he certain types of mood

827.04 --> 830.88
that's just mark sergeant if you can't

829.6 --> 834.1800000000001
handle that then

830.88 --> 837.23
yeah find somebody else

834.18 --> 837.2299999999999
[Music]

837.92 --> 841.279
oh you don't think he is even a flat

840.079 --> 843.519
earther

841.279 --> 845.279
he was ever a flat earth and that's

843.519 --> 848.32
ridiculous flat side that's

845.279 --> 848.32
that is ridiculous

848.639 --> 855.199
you can't get so deep into it

851.76 --> 858.399
and and act

855.199 --> 859.279
like truly believe the ball and then act

858.399 --> 863.04
like that

859.279 --> 864.72
it's impossible unless you literally do

863.04 --> 867.4399999999999
it to yourself

864.72 --> 868.9590000000001
like for example jose who did actually

867.44 --> 872.48
get the arguments and then

868.959 --> 874.4799999999999
after he rejected it then suddenly he

872.48 --> 877.6800000000001
didn't get it anymore when he did

874.48 --> 879.36
provably on camera he did get it and now

877.68 --> 880.6389999999999
suddenly he doesn't get it anymore so

879.36 --> 883.44
yeah

880.639 --> 885.12
he is get mark sergeant gets what he

883.44 --> 887.7600000000001
says

885.12 --> 888.16
he doesn't have a script writer he does

887.76 --> 890.88
it

888.16 --> 892.079
he thinks of it he plans it out

890.88 --> 895.8389999999999
sometimes

892.079 --> 896.6389999999999
you know because he is a flat earther

895.839 --> 898.9590000000001
you can't

896.639 --> 900.9590000000001
be a baller and then fake that [ __ ] it's

898.959 --> 905.92
absolutely preposterous

900.959 --> 905.92
please look at what you're saying

909.199 --> 913.8389999999999
yeah hey stallion 8012 yeah i'm doing

924.839 --> 927.839
good

929.839 --> 934.32
yeah can a man well i don't know how

932.32 --> 935.839
long you've been following mark sardin

934.32 --> 937.759
you know if you're just going by

935.839 --> 938.9590000000001
rumors of what ballers say about him

937.759 --> 941.519
yeah

938.959 --> 942.3199999999999
yeah over the years he's done a lot so

941.519 --> 945.04
they he's

942.32 --> 946.5600000000001
he said a lot of bad jokes like a lot

945.04 --> 947.92
because he's very active and he just

946.56 --> 949.5189999999999
does that

947.92 --> 952.16
so they're gonna collect all kinds of

949.519 --> 955.04
weird nutty rumors

952.16 --> 957.199
but that are just based on on purpose

955.04 --> 960.399
misunderstanding his jokes which are

957.199 --> 964.0
very obviously jokes

960.399 --> 965.839
obvious enough but you can only really

964.0 --> 967.44
learn to see it for yourself if you've

965.839 --> 969.0400000000001
been following him for some time well

967.44 --> 970.639
i've been following him pretty much from

969.04 --> 972.8
the start he's kind of the guy that

970.639 --> 978.32
pulled me

972.8 --> 978.3199999999999
in to do youtube activities myself

980.24 --> 997.839
so i've been keeping track track of him

982.32 --> 997.839
for a long time

1000.72 --> 1005.6800000000001
yeah tiny bumble mark sergeant is a very

1003.199 --> 1009.12
nice person

1005.68 --> 1011.8389999999999
he's a very uh

1009.12 --> 1013.6
well just it has a noble attitude kind

1011.839 --> 1016.0
of like what i try

1013.6 --> 1017.6
except with me i still have yeah i have

1016.0 --> 1020.16
strong ego

1017.6 --> 1021.6
so i have like dominance sometimes that

1020.16 --> 1023.4399999999999
gets in the way or

1021.6 --> 1024.959
whatever you know it's a matter of

1023.44 --> 1028.0
perspective on that

1024.959 --> 1030.799
mark not so much but he does have like

1028.0 --> 1030.799
this weird

1031.36 --> 1034.8799999999999
you call that low-key side to him as

1034.079 --> 1036.959
well

1034.88 --> 1040.5590000000002
and that expresses itself in like kind

1036.959 --> 1044.72
of like bit dark humor sometimes

1040.559 --> 1044.72
and that's really his only downside

1045.039 --> 1049.44
because he in impractic impracticality

1047.52 --> 1051.2
when you're serious he's a super great

1049.44 --> 1054.48
guy

1051.2 --> 1054.48
he's very helpful

1061.84 --> 1068.3999999999999
hey karen b hello

1065.2 --> 1071.28
things are jumping off in the hague i i

1068.4 --> 1071.2800000000002
jumping off what

1072.32 --> 1075.6789999999999
i know there's all kinds of hassle going

1074.48 --> 1078.16
on in the netherlands

1075.679 --> 1080.64
that they they're now suggesting about

1078.16 --> 1083.52
freaking quarantine [ __ ] as well

1080.64 --> 1085.3600000000001
they're suggesting all batteries of

1083.52 --> 1087.679
terrible things but

1085.36 --> 1088.6399999999999
yeah the people are really not in for

1087.679 --> 1090.64
this

1088.64 --> 1092.24
so if they're gonna do it they're

1090.64 --> 1095.2
they're gonna

1092.24 --> 1096.24
yeah it's going to break the government

1095.2 --> 1099.3600000000001
if they push this

1096.24 --> 1102.4
and even in government it's very divided

1099.36 --> 1106.32
so this is like an attempt corporate

1102.4 --> 1109.919
takeover from the yeah the high

1106.32 --> 1112.1599999999999
peons in the government

1109.919 --> 1112.96
and the prime minister is very much into

1112.16 --> 1117.28
that

1112.96 --> 1123.8400000000001
into that group and yeah so

1117.28 --> 1123.84
i don't know what's going to happen

1128.799 --> 1132.16
stallion 80 12 he does contradict

1130.96 --> 1137.8400000000001
himself sometimes

1132.16 --> 1137.8400000000001
well do you have an example of this

1145.76 --> 1152.0
you know i've had i've heard him

1149.28 --> 1152.6399999999999
backtracking on something sometimes

1152.0 --> 1155.84
usually

1152.64 --> 1158.24
just more little details

1155.84 --> 1159.9189999999999
and then he would be like uh and then

1158.24 --> 1163.28
realized oh wait

1159.919 --> 1167.2
i i said it wrong and then kind of like

1163.28 --> 1170.3999999999999
waiting and then he corrects himself

1167.2 --> 1172.24
or he yeah but never really

1170.4 --> 1174.799
contradicting like

1172.24 --> 1179.84
blatant contradictions do you have any

1174.799 --> 1179.84
examples of that stalin

1199.039 --> 1205.76
uh can a man no no flat earth

1202.24 --> 1208.24
has never been dependent on meetups

1205.76 --> 1209.84
flat earth is dependent on internet

1208.24 --> 1213.679
groups

1209.84 --> 1216.72
social media so yeah

1213.679 --> 1220.5590000000002
at best the whole car the coroner

1216.72 --> 1224.4
coronu situation is only going to

1220.559 --> 1226.6399999999999
amplify the flat earth situation

1224.4 --> 1227.52
and probably the ballers too some of

1226.64 --> 1229.919
them

1227.52 --> 1231.2
they will have new people as well but a

1229.919 --> 1232.7990000000002
lot of them a lot of the

1231.2 --> 1234.64
people that have kind of been sitting

1232.799 --> 1236.08
sort of in the shadows too busy with

1234.64 --> 1238.0
their work or something

1236.08 --> 1240.0
yeah a lot of them have been cut off

1238.0 --> 1241.679
from their jobs

1240.0 --> 1244.24
and so what are they gonna do well

1241.679 --> 1248.3200000000002
they're then gonna take that extra foot

1244.24 --> 1250.559
that extra step and go maybe fall in

1248.32 --> 1252.32
you know and i bet there's plenty of

1250.559 --> 1254.24
flat earthers that

1252.32 --> 1256.08
have been in that position that are

1254.24 --> 1259.28
stepping forward there's been a lot of

1256.08 --> 1259.28
new people on the scene

1260.84 --> 1263.84
so

1269.84 --> 1274.0
he says there is a dome yeah mark

1272.48 --> 1277.44
sergeant says there is a dome

1274.0 --> 1280.48
it's right he does reify that

1277.44 --> 1281.76
because and he's even if he's admitted

1280.48 --> 1284.4
to that that he is

1281.76 --> 1285.28
basically choosing it for political

1284.4 --> 1288.5590000000002
purposes

1285.28 --> 1292.24
in not literally any politics but

1288.559 --> 1297.2
because and i've supported this is that

1292.24 --> 1299.6
the snow globe model is something

1297.2 --> 1300.799
you can solidify in your mind it's

1299.6 --> 1303.4399999999998
something that gives you

1300.799 --> 1304.4
an easy quick oversight alternative to

1303.44 --> 1307.1200000000001
the globe

1304.4 --> 1307.76
and he's aiming for the wider public so

1307.12 --> 1310.6399999999999
that

1307.76 --> 1311.919
is why he said that he reifies the snow

1310.64 --> 1314.48
globe

1311.919 --> 1316.24
that he says it's real basically to

1314.48 --> 1318.48
assist in that process even though he's

1316.24 --> 1320.32
also admitted that the true nature of

1318.48 --> 1322.48
the realm is quite mysterious

1320.32 --> 1323.4399999999998
and might be even above his

1322.48 --> 1327.28
understanding

1323.44 --> 1331.52
okay so

1327.28 --> 1333.36
yeah mark's been around for a while

1331.52 --> 1335.9189999999999
you know and flat earth is really his

1333.36 --> 1338.559
passion but he also sees it as a

1335.919 --> 1341.1200000000001
as a literal awakening project how do we

1338.559 --> 1345.039
reach the maximum amount of people

1341.12 --> 1345.039
and how does that work

1345.36 --> 1351.4399999999998
so right indeed dank

1349.44 --> 1353.6000000000001
mark and his rants are top notch they

1351.44 --> 1353.6000000000001
are

1355.36 --> 1361.84
midgets living under the ground that

1357.28 --> 1361.84
work with artificial gravity machines

1362.72 --> 1368.48
oh god that's hilarious

1366.159 --> 1370.72
i think that's probably a joke but who

1368.48 --> 1372.96
knows maybe it is a rumor he got through

1370.72 --> 1374.96
some of his buddies or something from

1372.96 --> 1376.88
the military i don't know

1374.96 --> 1379.3600000000001
you know there's a lot of weird stories

1376.88 --> 1383.6000000000001
out there and some of them may

1379.36 --> 1383.6
be crazy enough to be real so

1384.0 --> 1403.84
hey ordinary bear it's a long time since

1387.36 --> 1403.84
i've seen a bear in here

1416.64 --> 1421.679
selected what what

1426.32 --> 1431.9189999999999
what are you kidding me mother

1429.919 --> 1434.24
because of all the media attention he

1431.919 --> 1435.8400000000001
gets why do you think he gets all that

1434.24 --> 1438.4
media attention

1435.84 --> 1440.9599999999998
it's because he reaches out to

1438.4 --> 1444.72
everything

1440.96 --> 1449.8400000000001
he is literally has open door

1444.72 --> 1453.3600000000001
ready yeah ready for contact policy

1449.84 --> 1454.1589999999999
so yeah and he's been very upfront very

1453.36 --> 1456.7199999999998
early

1454.159 --> 1459.0390000000002
unashamed to basically put himself out

1456.72 --> 1461.1200000000001
there so yeah of course

1459.039 --> 1463.44
if you're gonna just forward yourself as

1461.12 --> 1467.279
a pretty

1463.44 --> 1469.919
yeah generally reliable representative

1467.279 --> 1472.559
that might touch upon the wider public

1469.919 --> 1475.5200000000002
and like the goofy kids or whatever

1472.559 --> 1476.72
people associate it with right then it's

1475.52 --> 1478.48
going to be like oh yeah

1476.72 --> 1481.919
the flat earth guy because you don't

1478.48 --> 1483.279
want the potential extreme intellectuals

1481.919 --> 1485.279
that have really weird

1483.279 --> 1486.96
like really weird [ __ ] on top of that

1485.279 --> 1490.0
that look really weird yeah

1486.96 --> 1491.279
sorry it's just how that works and mark

1490.0 --> 1494.32
has none of that

1491.279 --> 1496.72
he's he's just really averaging it out

1494.32 --> 1499.279
still keeping it kind of smart and but

1496.72 --> 1502.48
keeping the smarts a lot in the comedy

1499.279 --> 1505.12
and he's just very nice doesn't

1502.48 --> 1506.08
do too creepy a thing and so yeah he's

1505.12 --> 1508.0
just seen as a

1506.08 --> 1510.72
representatives here how he represents

1508.0 --> 1511.039
himself and he's reached out very early

1510.72 --> 1514.4
on

1511.039 --> 1517.44
very wide and took everything like

1514.4 --> 1521.44
that means something you know that

1517.44 --> 1525.52
that's like that goes on the record

1521.44 --> 1527.279
for the research that media people do

1525.52 --> 1528.559
so they find him and see like wow this

1527.279 --> 1531.44
guy does everything

1528.559 --> 1532.08
so yeah he's like on the top of the list

1531.44 --> 1535.279
basically

1532.08 --> 1543.52
every time see it's not strange that

1535.279 --> 1546.0
he's contacted by media a lot

1543.52 --> 1547.679
entitled to my opinion i'm just trying

1546.0 --> 1551.039
to explain it

1547.679 --> 1551.039
to how that really works

1552.24 --> 1557.84
he's done a lot of work to get to that

1555.039 --> 1557.84
position

1561.679 --> 1565.1200000000001
and that doesn't mean he paid money no

1564.32 --> 1568.08
or he got

1565.12 --> 1569.36
paid no he done he's done a lot of work

1568.08 --> 1572.3999999999999
a lot of time

1569.36 --> 1575.1999999999998
and energy and effort and

1572.4 --> 1576.88
probably self-training also like really

1575.2 --> 1578.88
to

1576.88 --> 1580.72
to even out his own because he has a

1578.88 --> 1581.3600000000001
personal life he must have emotions and

1580.72 --> 1582.96
all that

1581.36 --> 1584.8799999999999
to keep it all straight and all that

1582.96 --> 1587.039
yeah he's done a lot of work i know he

1584.88 --> 1590.96
has

1587.039 --> 1594.32
seen it because he was even kind of

1590.96 --> 1596.8400000000001
wilder at the start than he is now

1594.32 --> 1598.799
he's very controlled compared to in the

1596.84 --> 1602.559
beginning it's

1598.799 --> 1602.559
going really nutty sometimes

1607.6 --> 1612.32
anyway yeah yet he does not have the

1611.36 --> 1615.52
biggest channel

1612.32 --> 1615.52
in flat earth that's right

1616.24 --> 1622.64
but he's done all the socializing he's

1619.919 --> 1624.96
built connections he's built media

1622.64 --> 1626.159
awareness this is one of his things he's

1624.96 --> 1630.24
done that from the beginning

1626.159 --> 1630.24
keep the keep track of everything

1630.799 --> 1641.84
you know

1648.0 --> 1656.799
okay good servant

1654.96 --> 1659.039
i get it you know sometimes there are

1656.799 --> 1662.72
things that i've seen from eric debate

1659.039 --> 1662.72
that i liked very much as well

1663.12 --> 1669.279
you know it's just that

1666.72 --> 1670.72
in certain traits that i kind of don't

1669.279 --> 1673.679
like so much

1670.72 --> 1675.3600000000001
and i yeah basically explain about i

1673.679 --> 1676.3990000000001
don't want to get into that too much but

1675.36 --> 1681.279
i get it

1676.399 --> 1684.0
no and he's very proud of his

1681.279 --> 1685.919
videos the videos where he's reading out

1684.0 --> 1687.039
like something that he wrote in in great

1685.919 --> 1690.0
detail

1687.039 --> 1690.799
like he's very proud of doing that as as

1690.0 --> 1692.88
well as he can

1690.799 --> 1694.6399999999999
and improving it and so yeah he does

1692.88 --> 1696.3200000000002
provide quality

1694.64 --> 1699.279
reading material that he reads out and

1696.32 --> 1703.2
all that his audio books are great

1699.279 --> 1706.559
but overall you know i

1703.2 --> 1708.64
wouldn't personally

1706.559 --> 1710.0
choose him as a representative because

1708.64 --> 1713.1200000000001
socially is it had a lot

1710.0 --> 1716.799
of issues and

1713.12 --> 1719.76
attitude issues

1716.799 --> 1721.6
and he's seeded a lot of like infighting

1719.76 --> 1723.76
and conspiracy thinking

1721.6 --> 1727.76
towards other flat earthers too though

1723.76 --> 1729.6
he practically invented that

1727.76 --> 1731.2
this yeah the infighting you know

1729.6 --> 1732.9599999999998
ballers were already doing that [ __ ] but

1731.2 --> 1734.72
he started doing that against flat

1732.96 --> 1735.279
earthers it's like the first person i

1734.72 --> 1739.84
remember

1735.279 --> 1739.84
that started doing that so

1741.76 --> 1745.2
no he called mark sargent and patricia

1744.72 --> 1748.0
stare

1745.2 --> 1749.919
a shill he started that and that was

1748.0 --> 1753.84
like in 2015

1749.919 --> 1753.8400000000001
okay right

1754.24 --> 1766.48
but i get it if you still like him

1757.6 --> 1769.1999999999998
if you still like his work

1766.48 --> 1769.2
it's a bow

1778.84 --> 1783.84
anymore

1781.36 --> 1784.9599999999998
yeah that's right karen we yeah that is

1783.84 --> 1786.72
right

1784.96 --> 1788.96
mark sarkin has never made a hit piece

1786.72 --> 1790.159
against anyone and neither have i by the

1788.96 --> 1793.279
way

1790.159 --> 1796.0
like this you know i do

1793.279 --> 1797.12
sometimes give my analysis of people or

1796.0 --> 1799.76
vent my anger

1797.12 --> 1799.76
over people

1800.32 --> 1805.2
but yeah when it comes to other flat

1803.12 --> 1807.6
earthers i take that very serious

1805.2 --> 1809.039
see it almost like a social court

1807.6 --> 1810.8799999999999
situation

1809.039 --> 1812.32
that's how it feels to me i take it very

1810.88 --> 1814.0
seriously i'm not going to slander

1812.32 --> 1817.52
anyone but i will point out what they're

1814.0 --> 1817.52
doing wrong or whatever

1818.48 --> 1821.679
but i don't mix hit pieces like that's

1820.96 --> 1823.279
yeah

1821.679 --> 1825.52
and mark sergeant never has done that

1823.279 --> 1829.6
either and hey with logan paul

1825.52 --> 1829.6
well the guy literally betrayed

1829.919 --> 1834.0
people like from top down and it was

1833.279 --> 1837.36
like a

1834.0 --> 1839.279
yeah it was a mole situation yeah so it

1837.36 --> 1840.24
makes total sense that he did do it for

1839.279 --> 1842.08
him

1840.24 --> 1844.32
you know i could have for example done

1842.08 --> 1848.1589999999999
the same thing with

1844.32 --> 1851.9189999999999
uh with jose jg you know

1848.159 --> 1853.7600000000002
i kind of did dedicate an episode to it

1851.919 --> 1855.2
but if that's like a separate hit piece

1853.76 --> 1858.399
i don't know

1855.2 --> 1861.279
so yeah i don't really tend to do that

1858.399 --> 1863.279
unless it's like yeah flat earther or

1861.279 --> 1864.0
presumed to be flat earther that's like

1863.279 --> 1867.519
really

1864.0 --> 1869.919
bit showing treachery you know

1867.519 --> 1870.559
thank god that that doesn't happen too

1869.919 --> 1873.039
often

1870.559 --> 1874.1589999999999
with like long-term colleagues you know

1873.039 --> 1875.76
some people may

1874.159 --> 1877.7600000000002
pretend to be a flat earther and then

1875.76 --> 1879.2
suddenly after a while reveal themselves

1877.76 --> 1882.559
to be a baller or

1879.2 --> 1885.8400000000001
somebody that tricked you in some way

1882.559 --> 1888.08
but they don't hold that back for like

1885.84 --> 1890.6399999999999
years or something or half a years

1888.08 --> 1892.72
most ballers can't do that they can't

1890.64 --> 1895.039
hold out that long pretending to be a

1892.72 --> 1898.0
flat earther they just can't handle it

1895.039 --> 1898.0
it's too strenuous

1899.44 --> 1907.8400000000001
hey amanda you

1910.559 --> 1917.12
oh i didn't even know that kind of man

1914.24 --> 1918.84
that mad mike had an issue i didn't know

1917.12 --> 1921.84
that

1918.84 --> 1921.84
hmm

1924.799 --> 1927.9189999999999
yeah i was number two you know i was

1927.279 --> 1930.32
never too

1927.919 --> 1931.6000000000001
interested in that sort of thing like

1930.32 --> 1933.36
hypey people

1931.6 --> 1936.08
that's really what it is it's high hypey

1933.36 --> 1940.32
people logan paul

1936.08 --> 1943.6
and yet mad mike it's just hype

1940.32 --> 1946.6399999999999
it's all people that purely

1943.6 --> 1949.76
propel themselves through hype

1946.64 --> 1955.039
and i don't like it at all

1949.76 --> 1955.039
it feels so dumb

1955.6 --> 1963.84
i just don't like it

1974.84 --> 1980.399
okay

1976.799 --> 1980.399
all right that's

1982.399 --> 1991.84
done caps here

2003.6 --> 2007.9189999999999
okay are you having a discussion among

2006.0 --> 2011.12
one another now

2007.919 --> 2014.0800000000002
dude stop it getting a time out

2011.12 --> 2014.08
the next time you're banned

2016.32 --> 2019.84
okay amanda young

2020.0 --> 2024.48
or immediately banned

2024.559 --> 2033.84
fine i don't really care uh

2058.839 --> 2065.119
okay i get that

2061.76 --> 2068.32
karen b but yeah he could

2065.119 --> 2071.44
just share that without caps

2068.32 --> 2073.2000000000003
and then just honestly ask if he can

2071.44 --> 2077.599
share the link or something

2073.2 --> 2081.2
you know don't spam your website link

2077.599 --> 2084.7200000000003
in caps in my chat please that's

2081.2 --> 2084.72
yeah spamming is not allowed

2085.359 --> 2089.839
and i no caps

2092.32 --> 2095.599
uh monster slim

2097.599 --> 2102.48
yeah maybe he is more genuine in some

2101.04 --> 2104.4
way you know

2102.48 --> 2107.04
because that was himself does that make

2104.4 --> 2107.04
him better

2107.599 --> 2117.2000000000003
doesn't really make a good

2108.8 --> 2119.52
representative you know

2117.2 --> 2121.9199999999996
now i'm not scared of it i just don't

2119.52 --> 2121.92
like it

2122.48 --> 2128.96
you know i use capital letters at the

2126.24 --> 2130.4799999999996
start of a word or a sentence you know i

2128.96 --> 2131.92
at the start of a word if i want to

2130.48 --> 2135.599
amplify that word

2131.92 --> 2137.839
i don't caps it unless it like

2135.599 --> 2139.76
very specifically the word needs to be

2137.839 --> 2142.7999999999997
extremely overemphasized

2139.76 --> 2144.079
needs to pop in your eye immediately and

2142.8 --> 2146.0
then still i prevent

2144.079 --> 2148.6400000000003
doing that as much as possible because

2146.0 --> 2152.32
it just turns into yelling

2148.64 --> 2155.04
and it's really annoying so unless

2152.32 --> 2159.04
it has to be caps because it's basically

2155.04 --> 2161.92
short like logos

2159.04 --> 2161.92
that's all caps

2167.599 --> 2173.839
but that's one of the few exceptions

2189.68 --> 2192.3999999999996
that what

2193.119 --> 2201.839
is it dread i don't think so

2212.839 --> 2215.839
what

2226.839 --> 2233.119
hmm

2229.52 --> 2234.72
right well george sanford yeah there may

2233.119 --> 2238.0
not be science

2234.72 --> 2240.72
scientific method in order to establish

2238.0 --> 2243.839
the orientation of the realm but there's

2240.72 --> 2243.839
definitely geometry

2247.599 --> 2251.599
and that there's what we've learned of

2249.599 --> 2254.0
optics

2251.599 --> 2256.48
so we can physically measure from one

2254.0 --> 2258.64
point to the other and

2256.48 --> 2260.88
we can see from one point to the other

2258.64 --> 2264.56
and with these two tools

2260.88 --> 2267.6800000000003
you can derive geometrical aspects

2264.56 --> 2271.04
and affect optical effects and there's

2267.68 --> 2273.7599999999998
this has all been worked out the optics

2271.04 --> 2275.599
are worked out it exists the knowledge

2273.76 --> 2277.5200000000004
of how it all works

2275.599 --> 2279.119
it's just very difficult to get an

2277.52 --> 2280.72
understanding of it all because it's

2279.119 --> 2282.4
quite a lot of different types of

2280.72 --> 2283.4399999999996
elements and lenses and all that it's

2282.4 --> 2287.2000000000003
really complicated

2283.44 --> 2288.96
in reality but if you put your mind to

2287.2 --> 2291.2799999999997
it and you have enough room

2288.96 --> 2293.2
in your head then you can get it

2291.28 --> 2295.44
straight over sometimes it took me

2293.2 --> 2296.3199999999997
quite a long time and hey i'm not a dumb

2295.44 --> 2299.52
person you know

2296.32 --> 2301.3590000000004
especially when it comes to visuals so

2299.52 --> 2303.7599999999998
but it was still very tough to figure it

2301.359 --> 2303.7599999999998
all out

2305.52 --> 2310.96
and yeah with those tools that with that

2308.8 --> 2314.4
understanding you can derive

2310.96 --> 2317.599
a geometry so

2314.4 --> 2319.119
there's basically two types of geometry

2317.599 --> 2321.839
that we can

2319.119 --> 2323.2000000000003
be confronted with that is a flat

2321.839 --> 2328.16
geometry

2323.2 --> 2332.0789999999997
and it is a not flat geometry

2328.16 --> 2334.0
because yeah everything that's not flat

2332.079 --> 2335.44
doesn't really matter what it is it's

2334.0 --> 2337.839
not flat because

2335.44 --> 2339.44
then there's going to be a shape or demi

2337.839 --> 2342.56
shape or anything

2339.44 --> 2347.04
you know from concave to spherical to

2342.56 --> 2350.16
convex or whatever wobbly wobbly earth

2347.04 --> 2354.079
spatially irregular loop

2350.16 --> 2359.2
looping earth doesn't really matter

2354.079 --> 2363.28
but yeah so is it

2359.2 --> 2364.24
is it geometrically flat or is there any

2363.28 --> 2366.7200000000003
sign that there

2364.24 --> 2369.1189999999997
is a non-flatness happening well what is

2366.72 --> 2372.0789999999997
the natural consequence of non-flatness

2369.119 --> 2373.28
well that means in every case every

2372.079 --> 2377.76
single case

2373.28 --> 2381.28
geometrically with non-flatness it means

2377.76 --> 2385.76
that if you translate that to visuals

2381.28 --> 2385.76
there's going to be uh yeah

2388.68 --> 2396.0789999999997
cumulativeness i don't know if that even

2391.76 --> 2399.2000000000003
is a word

2396.079 --> 2401.2000000000003
going to be non-linear stacking

2399.2 --> 2403.52
of visuals over distance in one way or

2401.2 --> 2403.52
the other

2408.839 --> 2411.839
trolls

2414.079 --> 2421.599
so yeah is that there is or

2417.68 --> 2425.52
do all optics measuring

2421.599 --> 2428.4
or calculation results result in

2425.52 --> 2429.44
linearity like for example the

2428.4 --> 2432.64
concealment

2429.44 --> 2435.839
rate after the apparent horizon

2432.64 --> 2439.04
right does the amount

2435.839 --> 2441.44
increase cumulatively over distance

2439.04 --> 2443.359
or does it decrease and inverse right

2441.44 --> 2447.119
which would happen on a concave

2443.359 --> 2450.4
situation right no does not blatantly

2447.119 --> 2450.96
obviously not concave gotta be a

2450.4 --> 2454.0
complete

2450.96 --> 2458.16
[ __ ] to think that

2454.0 --> 2458.16
right so well

2458.48 --> 2462.16
i have not seen any kind of cumulative

2460.64 --> 2465.839
drop or

2462.16 --> 2467.5989999999997
decrease at all of concealment rates

2465.839 --> 2469.44
over distance

2467.599 --> 2471.52
there's no indication i've set the

2469.44 --> 2474.2400000000002
challenge out there for ballers

2471.52 --> 2475.2
like can you find this can you find

2474.24 --> 2477.2799999999997
proof

2475.2 --> 2480.64
can you calculate it has it ever even

2477.28 --> 2482.48
been mapped out

2480.64 --> 2485.1189999999997
concealment rate over distance after

2482.48 --> 2489.119
apparent horizon

2485.119 --> 2492.1600000000003
do things drop off with increasing

2489.119 --> 2494.88
depth over distance yeah

2492.16 --> 2496.8799999999997
cumulative drop remember which would be

2494.88 --> 2500.1600000000003
a necessity

2496.88 --> 2501.599
for a spherical geometry of what we're

2500.16 --> 2505.04
standing on

2501.599 --> 2505.76
no there isn't at all but yeah the

2505.04 --> 2507.599
ballers

2505.76 --> 2510.0
and their machinations have used their

2507.599 --> 2512.6400000000003
mechanism to try to trick us

2510.0 --> 2514.24
to make us believe like it did by

2512.64 --> 2517.52
basically

2514.24 --> 2519.1189999999997
taking perspective size change out of

2517.52 --> 2522.079
the calculation

2519.119 --> 2523.2000000000003
without telling you so that you all

2522.079 --> 2526.48
imagine

2523.2 --> 2528.72
in a yeah non-perspective way like it's

2526.48 --> 2532.079
all parallel autographic view

2528.72 --> 2534.72
and then saying yes see it's gone down

2532.079 --> 2536.7200000000003
because of the drop no it's not it's

2534.72 --> 2537.4399999999996
gone down because of the angular size

2536.72 --> 2540.72
reduction

2537.44 --> 2540.7200000000003
in the actual picture

2540.8 --> 2543.8390000000004
see so they try to use the machination

2542.72 --> 2545.9199999999996
to trick you

2543.839 --> 2548.56
into thinking that there is a cumulative

2545.92 --> 2551.2000000000003
drop and there's not

2548.56 --> 2552.16
there's only the increasing consummate

2551.2 --> 2555.1189999999997
rate after the

2552.16 --> 2556.72
apparent horizon point over distant and

2555.119 --> 2558.4
it's linear

2556.72 --> 2560.0789999999997
that's complete it's just what is going

2558.4 --> 2563.28
to be bottom ups concealed

2560.079 --> 2566.7200000000003
that thing that's a separate effect from

2563.28 --> 2571.599
objects simply getting smaller

2566.72 --> 2573.52
over distance because of perspective

2571.599 --> 2576.48
two different elements that happen

2573.52 --> 2578.4
simultaneously so while over distance

2576.48 --> 2580.079
the side the apparent size for the

2578.4 --> 2585.2000000000003
observer decreases

2580.079 --> 2588.1600000000003
also does the concealment rate

2585.2 --> 2590.24
increase over distance at a linear rate

2588.16 --> 2593.44
but

2590.24 --> 2595.52
it is also at the same time smaller

2593.44 --> 2596.8
because it's farther away and thus

2595.52 --> 2601.119
perspective also

2596.8 --> 2604.2400000000002
is makes it angular-wise smaller

2601.119 --> 2606.96
and this kind of yeah

2604.24 --> 2608.0789999999997
goes hand in hand together and causes

2606.96 --> 2610.319
this

2608.079 --> 2612.319
linear obstruction rate and that's how i

2610.319 --> 2613.92
resulted in the optical slant it's

2612.319 --> 2616.56
because of the combination

2613.92 --> 2618.7200000000003
the combination of angular size decrease

2616.56 --> 2622.0789999999997
due to perspective over distance

2618.72 --> 2623.5989999999997
and the consumant rate beyond the

2622.079 --> 2625.28
apparent horizon point due to

2623.599 --> 2628.88
diffraction

2625.28 --> 2629.28
both apply on objects because it's

2628.88 --> 2631.839
always

2629.28 --> 2632.7200000000003
objects you know the the horizon is an

2631.839 --> 2636.7999999999997
apparent effect

2632.72 --> 2639.359
it cannot be concealed it conceals

2636.8 --> 2641.44
it's in effect and anything that is

2639.359 --> 2642.24
concealed in the concealment rate after

2641.44 --> 2646.04
the horizon

2642.24 --> 2649.2799999999997
is concealed by the horizon it's

2646.04 --> 2652.72
apparently below it because there's a

2649.28 --> 2657.3590000000004
consummate rate that happens and

2652.72 --> 2660.64
yeah so though that's what happens

2657.359 --> 2663.52
in my explanation and i made a graph for

2660.64 --> 2668.24
it the eyeball with a stick

2663.52 --> 2668.24
shared it many many many times by now

2668.64 --> 2672.7999999999997
let me do it again just to back it up

2671.52 --> 2677.839
with some visuals

2672.8 --> 2677.8390000000004
let me see where is it

2685.839 --> 2691.839
oh all right

2695.52 --> 2700.72
there you go eyeball on a stick

2703.04 --> 2708.319
concealment rate first

2706.319 --> 2709.839
yeah you get the the biggest chunk of

2708.319 --> 2712.88
the perspective

2709.839 --> 2715.44
size decrease and after some point

2712.88 --> 2717.52
the yeah the amount of angular size

2715.44 --> 2719.2000000000003
decrease becomes so small

2717.52 --> 2721.2
because yeah the distance keeps

2719.2 --> 2723.52
increasing but the size is already small

2721.2 --> 2726.56
so there is like

2723.52 --> 2729.7599999999998
but yeah eventually

2726.56 --> 2732.7999999999997
it it decreases less

2729.76 --> 2734.0
in size over distance angular size due

2732.8 --> 2736.6400000000003
to perspective

2734.0 --> 2737.28
the amount it shrinks angular wise

2736.64 --> 2739.839
becomes

2737.28 --> 2741.76
less when the distance is basically

2739.839 --> 2744.839
doubled every time it's very weird

2741.76 --> 2746.0
but at the beginning yeah it decreases

2744.839 --> 2749.2
significantly

2746.0 --> 2752.48
so it's like a half-life over distance

2749.2 --> 2755.2
size-wise roughly

2752.48 --> 2757.44
right and that results that after some

2755.2 --> 2760.7999999999997
point yeah the horizon appears

2757.44 --> 2764.4
after that things don't decrease in size

2760.8 --> 2765.28
as much but they will start concealing

2764.4 --> 2769.76
bottom up

2765.28 --> 2769.76
a lot until eventually it all blurs up

2769.92 --> 2775.6800000000003
because of the yeah refraction that

2774.16 --> 2778.48
eventually just blurs up

2775.68 --> 2780.319
everything and causes like this color

2778.48 --> 2782.079
background color soup

2780.319 --> 2783.359
after which you just can't see objects

2782.079 --> 2786.2400000000002
anymore they will

2783.359 --> 2788.0
first mirage distort out of whack like

2786.24 --> 2789.68
the extreme miraging and all that

2788.0 --> 2791.44
and then eventually it'll just blur up

2789.68 --> 2794.16
so badly and then

2791.44 --> 2795.599
at some this after some more distant you

2794.16 --> 2798.72
don't see anything

2795.599 --> 2800.319
it's just it's not visible anymore

2798.72 --> 2803.04
and that's because of refraction and

2800.319 --> 2806.319
that happens far beyond

2803.04 --> 2810.4
any optical slant due to yeah

2806.319 --> 2810.4
the diffraction so

2814.839 --> 2821.2
anyway

2816.079 --> 2821.2000000000003
right hope that's

2828.839 --> 2831.839
informative

2834.83 --> 2837.9
[Music]

2841.25 --> 2846.96
[Music]

2842.839 --> 2851.2799999999997
karen nah

2846.96 --> 2854.8
now karen b is just a baller but he's a

2851.28 --> 2858.079
relatively well-behaved baller so don't

2854.8 --> 2861.2000000000003
don't start talking poking my ballers

2858.079 --> 2864.8
too much unless they just start straight

2861.2 --> 2864.7999999999997
out insulting you of course but

2865.76 --> 2873.8390000000004
but what did you think about it karen b

2868.0 --> 2873.839
are you listening

2879.119 --> 2882.6400000000003
i didn't look at what he said

2884.48 --> 2890.0
what did he say

2887.52 --> 2890.88
observable that doesn't mean it's flat

2890.0 --> 2892.64
well that's just

2890.88 --> 2893.92
that's not a direct insult it's just

2892.64 --> 2896.0
really silly

2893.92 --> 2897.04
okay that's just his religious his

2896.0 --> 2899.599
religion it's

2897.04 --> 2900.64
he didn't even get all mean or foul or

2899.599 --> 2903.76
anything

2900.64 --> 2907.1189999999997
you know that's yeah it's a bit weird

2903.76 --> 2910.3190000000004
but this is a mixed panel

2907.119 --> 2912.559
or well a mixed chat and hey if they go

2910.319 --> 2914.48
over the over the edge you know

2912.559 --> 2916.8
behavioral wise then eventually i will

2914.48 --> 2920.8
kick them out and they know this

2916.8 --> 2922.2400000000002
and yeah there's still plenty of ballers

2920.8 --> 2924.7200000000003
out there that can behave pretty

2922.24 --> 2928.5589999999997
decently and give some good input

2924.72 --> 2931.68
i've discovered

2928.559 --> 2933.52
we you can see the curve from

2931.68 --> 2936.0789999999997
climbing a tree okay that is freaking

2933.52 --> 2936.079
hilarious

2937.46 --> 2944.2400000000002
[Music]

2940.319 --> 2944.24
but that's just funny come on

2952.319 --> 2958.64
yeah tiny wumboldon you know what i

2955.52 --> 2962.16
meant i said behavioral wise

2958.64 --> 2963.7599999999998
no yeah you might imagine going over the

2962.16 --> 2965.92
curve but that would only be

2963.76 --> 2966.8
if you misunderstand how optics work

2965.92 --> 2969.04
after yeah

2966.8 --> 2971.8390000000004
the presentation i i just gave you you

2969.04 --> 2971.839
should know that

2976.079 --> 2980.96
we have to be a damn tall tree yeah

2983.119 --> 2987.92
it wouldn't work though you know

2988.319 --> 2994.96
it's well well first off

2992.559 --> 2995.8390000000004
there is the geometry of course of earth

2994.96 --> 2998.0
and it's just

2995.839 --> 2999.119
really look if you think the earth is

2998.0 --> 3001.92
literally

2999.119 --> 3004.0
literally a ball then there is these

3001.92 --> 3005.04
geometrical consequences you cannot

3004.0 --> 3008.48
bypass

3005.04 --> 3012.16
and so yeah you would see the curve

3008.48 --> 3014.48
you would very quickly

3012.16 --> 3015.68
and there's even yeah pretty rough

3014.48 --> 3019.04
animations that

3015.68 --> 3019.68
show this that yes if you raise an

3019.04 --> 3022.0
altitude

3019.68 --> 3023.04
it should drop away you should

3022.0 --> 3026.079
absolutely

3023.04 --> 3030.24
feel yourself getting distant

3026.079 --> 3032.8
from a ball it would happen absolutely

3030.24 --> 3034.0
okay and it doesn't happen what instead

3032.8 --> 3037.3590000000004
happens is

3034.0 --> 3039.76
you see it like a flat disc below you

3037.359 --> 3040.64
which with uplifting edges fit is a

3039.76 --> 3042.96
visual effect

3040.64 --> 3044.4
it's at the edges only and after that

3042.96 --> 3047.2
you don't see anything

3044.4 --> 3047.92
you know why refraction not terrestrial

3047.2 --> 3050.96
refraction

3047.92 --> 3054.7200000000003
regular refraction the line

3050.96 --> 3058.0
of sight soup it's like a

3054.72 --> 3059.839
it's not word soup it's light soup it's

3058.0 --> 3062.64
like everything

3059.839 --> 3065.599
the light that came from over there is

3062.64 --> 3065.839
so distorted by the compacted refraction

3065.599 --> 3067.76
of

3065.839 --> 3070.88
everything it had to go through from

3067.76 --> 3074.0
origin point to arrival in your eyes

3070.88 --> 3076.1600000000003
that it simply mashes everything up it

3074.0 --> 3077.359
it blurs together everything blurs

3076.16 --> 3080.16
together like a

3077.359 --> 3082.4
color soup an average color soup and

3080.16 --> 3084.3999999999996
that is the end of sight

3082.4 --> 3086.7200000000003
and it always happens after a certain

3084.4 --> 3089.04
distance in the atmosphere of the earth

3086.72 --> 3090.3999999999996
in the air of the earth basically

3089.04 --> 3094.16
because it's roughly

3090.4 --> 3097.2000000000003
in the same refraction

3094.16 --> 3097.839
of yeah refraction range so it's never

3097.2 --> 3101.2799999999997
going to be

3097.839 --> 3103.2799999999997
no refraction no limit aside at all ever

3101.28 --> 3105.599
because there's no vacuum ever on the

3103.28 --> 3108.7200000000003
earth and it's not going to be

3105.599 --> 3110.6400000000003
super compact because yeah like the

3108.72 --> 3113.839
atmosphere of the pressure went up like

3110.64 --> 3116.48
two times that's insane since totally

3113.839 --> 3117.2799999999997
it couldn't happen anyway just like that

3116.48 --> 3118.64
not

3117.28 --> 3120.7200000000003
yeah not without some divine

3118.64 --> 3124.0
intervention or something anyway

3120.72 --> 3126.8799999999997
uh so it's always going to be roughly

3124.0 --> 3128.64
within the same refraction spectrum on

3126.88 --> 3132.1600000000003
the spectrum of refraction

3128.64 --> 3134.5589999999997
causing this blurred up disc

3132.16 --> 3136.72
so it's almost gonna yeah it's flat the

3134.559 --> 3138.0
geometry is flat and so there's a flat

3136.72 --> 3141.2
disc below you this is what

3138.0 --> 3142.319
picard saw when he looked through the

3141.2 --> 3145.4399999999996
lens

3142.319 --> 3147.599
in his balloon when he went up like a

3145.44 --> 3150.96
pancake with upturned edges

3147.599 --> 3154.319
and after that nothing he didn't see

3150.96 --> 3157.839
the dome you didn't no it's

3154.319 --> 3161.2799999999997
like a wall of color

3157.839 --> 3163.92
you just don't see anything specific

3161.28 --> 3166.48
anymore you don't you just see

3163.92 --> 3168.96
wall of color that's the end after that

3166.48 --> 3172.0
you can't distinguish anything more

3168.96 --> 3175.359
see so that's side

3172.0 --> 3181.839
but the geometry of what can be seen

3175.359 --> 3181.839
is flat every single time

3185.119 --> 3190.079
gravitational lensing that's science

3188.24 --> 3193.2799999999997
fiction

3190.079 --> 3197.52
gravitational lensing is the idea

3193.28 --> 3201.2000000000003
that gravity could be like

3197.52 --> 3204.4
i don't know like magnets compacted

3201.2 --> 3207.359
or something it's pure science fiction

3204.4 --> 3212.1600000000003
einsteinian based concept fiction

3207.359 --> 3214.96
it's it's nonsense gravitational lensing

3212.16 --> 3214.96
it's ridiculous

3215.44 --> 3219.839
i think it has to do with the reason why

3220.72 --> 3226.3999999999996
light would go around the black hole or

3223.599 --> 3229.92
something it's

3226.4 --> 3230.8
i don't know i'm i'm damn well sure it's

3229.92 --> 3232.48
science fiction

3230.8 --> 3235.119
and when you see some a word with

3232.48 --> 3237.44
gravitational in front of it you know

3235.119 --> 3239.04
it can only be science fiction because

3237.44 --> 3241.28
there is no scientific evidence for

3239.04 --> 3244.5589999999997
gravity at all it's an effect

3241.28 --> 3245.8390000000004
it doesn't cause anything and everything

3244.559 --> 3248.1600000000003
that's been tied in with it

3245.839 --> 3249.2799999999997
what it's supposed to be is has become

3248.16 --> 3252.48
pseudoscience

3249.28 --> 3254.559
and provable nonsense because newton

3252.48 --> 3257.52
never claimed the hypothesis

3254.559 --> 3259.44
for the theory yeah for the the theory

3257.52 --> 3264.16
of gravitation

3259.44 --> 3266.4
and einsteinian concepts are unprovable

3264.16 --> 3268.48
because they're conceptual people don't

3266.4 --> 3271.2000000000003
even literally they don't they can't

3268.48 --> 3272.079
even properly reify it into reality they

3271.2 --> 3275.68
can only just

3272.079 --> 3278.0
repeat the stories that try to describe

3275.68 --> 3280.319
the einsteinian thing

3278.0 --> 3282.0
because there is no physical evidence

3280.319 --> 3284.16
you can only describe it

3282.0 --> 3286.48
there is no tie and it doesn't exist

3284.16 --> 3288.64
even einstein didn't make it

3286.48 --> 3290.72
he just made weird descriptions and then

3288.64 --> 3293.2
people was like what

3290.72 --> 3294.9599999999996
okay i don't understand i feel kind of

3293.2 --> 3296.0
stupid because einstein's so good at

3294.96 --> 3299.44
math

3296.0 --> 3300.799
i'm just gonna say okay this is the

3299.44 --> 3304.16
reason

3300.799 --> 3307.839
because this bending of space-time

3304.16 --> 3309.92
they didn't get it now of course hey

3307.839 --> 3312.24
scientists and people in the field would

3309.92 --> 3314.88
ask like okay so what is this thing

3312.24 --> 3315.5989999999997
and then einstein would bring out the

3314.88 --> 3317.28
math

3315.599 --> 3319.6800000000003
basically like ballers do bring out a

3317.28 --> 3321.44
model this pseudo-romanian four space

3319.68 --> 3322.96
and show it in the model

3321.44 --> 3325.359
how it worked and then it's like yeah

3322.96 --> 3326.7200000000003
okay that seems mathematically sensible

3325.359 --> 3328.799
enough and blah blah blah

3326.72 --> 3330.319
but what is the physical proofread oh

3328.799 --> 3331.52
wait it doesn't exist because it's

3330.319 --> 3336.0
conceptual

3331.52 --> 3337.44
okay that's just freaking great

3336.0 --> 3339.359
yeah that's where you are now that's

3337.44 --> 3342.4
gravity

3339.359 --> 3346.0
get it doesn't exist

3342.4 --> 3348.0
it's a concept the gravitation

3346.0 --> 3349.44
is a concept it doesn't exist mass is

3348.0 --> 3351.28
not attracted by mass

3349.44 --> 3353.359
you can't even define mass what it

3351.28 --> 3354.7200000000003
really is in in physics

3353.359 --> 3357.5989999999997
you know in math you could probably

3354.72 --> 3363.04
define your own physics

3357.599 --> 3364.96
no you got a problem all right

3363.04 --> 3366.96
and yeah the whole einsteinian

3364.96 --> 3369.92
pseudo-romanian four space that's

3366.96 --> 3371.92
yeah that there is not even an

3369.92 --> 3377.839
experiment to re yeah to

3371.92 --> 3377.839
falsify because it's purely conceptual

3378.799 --> 3391.839
so yeah good luck

3382.16 --> 3391.839
good luck with the gravity

3396.799 --> 3402.559
i see i'm already triggered plenty of

3399.76 --> 3402.559
ballers in there

3403.04 --> 3407.04
ah they gotta quickly quickly pump out

3405.76 --> 3410.2400000000002
more science fiction

3407.04 --> 3412.96
garbage to soothe the

3410.24 --> 3415.5989999999997
blatant exposure of the open wound that

3412.96 --> 3417.76
is heliocentrism

3415.599 --> 3419.6800000000003
so you can't forget don't let it heal

3417.76 --> 3422.4
don't fix it now just

3419.68 --> 3424.16
distract yourself with more science

3422.4 --> 3426.4
fiction doubling down nonsense

3424.16 --> 3428.3999999999996
quickly put it out so others are

3426.4 --> 3429.599
distracted as well so they will all be

3428.4 --> 3432.2400000000002
convinced

3429.599 --> 3432.88
to go on the fantasy ride once again

3432.24 --> 3434.5589999999997
because

3432.88 --> 3436.6400000000003
yeah when you're stuck in that fantasy

3434.559 --> 3440.3190000000004
right you don't like to be reminded

3436.64 --> 3442.2
that it is a lie you know i don't mind

3440.319 --> 3443.359
i don't mind thinking about

3442.2 --> 3445.359
heliocentrism

3443.359 --> 3447.04
i don't even mind looking into science

3445.359 --> 3449.839
fiction series and even get

3447.04 --> 3451.839
concern over oh my god i don't want that

3449.839 --> 3453.68
planet to be blown up by this freaking

3451.839 --> 3455.52
death star or whatever i don't like the

3453.68 --> 3458.319
idea of that

3455.52 --> 3458.96
if it was actually heliocentrist

3458.319 --> 3461.839
universe

3458.96 --> 3464.4
i don't like the idea but i'm not going

3461.839 --> 3467.359
to fool myself in thinking like

3464.4 --> 3468.079
there is ever a point in time ever or

3467.359 --> 3471.52
was

3468.079 --> 3472.559
or could ever be that in physical

3471.52 --> 3475.599
reality

3472.559 --> 3478.96
that's the difference to me now it's

3475.599 --> 3482.1600000000003
more about people it's more about

3478.96 --> 3486.4
the human condition society

3482.16 --> 3488.96
and then grantly scale out technology

3486.4 --> 3490.799
it's just a medium it's just a medium

3488.96 --> 3491.359
for storytelling and it's really cool

3490.799 --> 3494.799
and you can

3491.359 --> 3498.0
easily make up all kinds of things and

3494.799 --> 3499.52
get really weird and creepy or whatever

3498.0 --> 3502.16
you like with it you know that's the

3499.52 --> 3504.88
great thing about the heliocentric

3502.16 --> 3505.359
science fiction storytelling medium but

3504.88 --> 3509.119
i will

3505.359 --> 3510.319
never reify in my mind like that could

3509.119 --> 3512.96
physically happen

3510.319 --> 3515.359
ever that's the difference and i am

3512.96 --> 3516.0
enjoying that i'm enjoying that i'm no

3515.359 --> 3519.5989999999997
longer

3516.0 --> 3523.44
tricked by my own glorious fantasy

3519.599 --> 3526.2400000000002
