113.6 --> 117.6
pretty

114.56 --> 117.60000000000001
dire at the moment

right anyway

121.68 --> 124.64
weather today is

125.6 --> 131.28
giant gray soup and there's this

128.399 --> 132.8
constant wind

131.28 --> 136.319
it's cold

132.8 --> 136.31900000000002
i noticed yesterday night

136.48 --> 143.84
like there was ice on cars everywhere

140.0 --> 143.84
also so it is called

145.68 --> 151.08
like this it's really starting to feel

147.44 --> 151.07999999999998
like winter now

156.08 --> 158.4
all right

158.8 --> 162.959
also

160.48 --> 162.959
hold on

166.72 --> 170.8
yeah

168.72 --> 173.84
i couldn't get my monitor started this

170.8 --> 177.519
morning so i actually

173.84 --> 177.519
used service days monitor

177.84 --> 181.84
and that worked just great it's a bit of

180.0 --> 185.64
a lower resolution but it doesn't matter

181.84 --> 185.64000000000001
because it just works

188.239 --> 194.31900000000002
hello jeff gas head

190.159 --> 197.959
first in chat bill nye designs denier

194.319 --> 197.95899999999997
good to see you both

202.959 --> 210.239
i am not feeling too great

206.64 --> 213.83999999999997
i'm very stressed out

210.239 --> 213.84
i've been since yesterday

214.48 --> 220.64
uh yeah my overall performance like

217.2 --> 223.92
during the night i'll show was

220.64 --> 223.92
i was very flustered

225.2 --> 227.83999999999997
oh man

232.879 --> 238.0
and yeah i've been like very kind of

235.519 --> 240.799
anxious this is not nervous anyways

238.0 --> 242.159
anxious

240.799 --> 244.56
and like

242.159 --> 246.0
when i went to bed as well and waking up

244.56 --> 248.159
and

246.0 --> 250.48
so i'm just really stressed out at the

248.159 --> 250.48
moment

250.879 --> 256.88
even though i did get

254.159 --> 259.68
great support

256.88 --> 261.6
at least big chunk of the way

259.68 --> 265.12
mostly from the guys

261.6 --> 266.24
even like most of them donated

265.12 --> 267.199
and

266.24 --> 270.72
i

267.199 --> 270.72
i'm really moved by that

272.88 --> 277.68
but i'm still so stressed out i can't

275.12 --> 279.52
get my bearings

277.68 --> 282.32
like i'm just

279.52 --> 284.79999999999995
i really like

282.32 --> 287.59999999999997
fell for the through the roof

284.8 --> 291.6
kind of thing yesterday when i found out

287.6 --> 294.16
that basically i hadn't paid my rent

291.6 --> 295.6
and that's never happened before in all

294.16 --> 298.16
the time i've lived here has never

295.6 --> 300.40000000000003
happened once and i'm just

298.16 --> 302.56
i couldn't handle it i still can't

300.4 --> 305.75899999999996
really handle it

302.56 --> 306.96
but yeah with the support i'm getting

305.759 --> 309.52000000000004
just

306.96 --> 310.71999999999997
a couple of more donations and i will be

309.52 --> 313.28
able to

310.72 --> 313.28000000000003
get through

316.88 --> 322.24
i'm basically almost there already

319.52 --> 325.56
thanks to the help of the guys

322.24 --> 325.56
right anyway

329.759 --> 333.44
i'm gonna just try to do the show

335.36 --> 344.40000000000003
and yeah i'm gonna not drink this today

340.639 --> 347.68
and i'm not like gonna smoke even

344.4 --> 347.67999999999995
because i'm just so stressed

350.72 --> 353.68
hey mike sudenich

354.4 --> 358.15999999999997
i mean i'd probably be a ride like

356.08 --> 361.15999999999997
tomorrow or something

358.16 --> 361.16
hopefully

366.639 --> 370.96000000000004
yeah i got an appointment with my social

368.56 --> 374.319
worker on monday

370.96 --> 374.31899999999996
kind of talk the situation

378.84 --> 384.479
through hello gadget inspector

382.24 --> 384.479
right

384.639 --> 388.319
but yeah it

386.0 --> 390.4
it might actually mean that

388.319 --> 393.199
i have to kind of discontinue the early

390.4 --> 396.23999999999995
bird show and i really

393.199 --> 396.24
really don't want to

396.96 --> 400.79999999999995
but like if my financial situation is

399.199 --> 403.44
gonna stay like this it's gonna be

400.8 --> 403.44
untenable

403.52 --> 409.28
i kind of tried to warn everybody about

406.08 --> 410.96
it for a while but

409.28 --> 412.63899999999995
i don't know i don't know what's going

410.96 --> 415.12
on i don't know

412.639 --> 418.56
if i've lost grace or something it feels

415.12 --> 420.56
almost like i've lost grace

418.56 --> 424.639
and i'm not worth it anymore or

420.56 --> 424.639
something but that might be just my

424.88 --> 427.759
panic talking

429.199 --> 434.639
right anyway

431.28 --> 434.63899999999995
yeah rob durham

435.599 --> 440.71999999999997
i was actually subscribed to him but i

438.08 --> 441.599
yeah it doesn't make a lot of videos

440.72 --> 444.24
so

441.599 --> 446.479
but yeah the video showing yesterday it

444.24 --> 450.08
was really interesting

446.479 --> 452.71999999999997
and i i took a look again this morning

450.08 --> 454.71999999999997
because like during that show i was so

452.72 --> 456.08000000000004
stressed out

454.72 --> 458.8
and like

456.08 --> 461.19899999999996
because it was all really rushed

458.8 --> 462.88
right doing that it was like in a panic

461.199 --> 464.639
moment like i have to do it now or i'm

462.88 --> 467.68
gonna like have a serious nervous

464.639 --> 467.68
breakdown basically

469.28 --> 474.15999999999997
and i kind of still did but at least i

472.16 --> 477.56
know i'm gonna get out of it you see

474.16 --> 477.56
that's the difference

488.639 --> 493.52
i didn't even get it coffee

492.08 --> 496.24
but yeah i don't think that would be

493.52 --> 496.24
wise right now

499.919 --> 504.4
might be going to the toilet quite a few

502.08 --> 504.4
times

505.44 --> 510.24
oh yeah also noticed that

507.919 --> 513.199
yeah the show yesterday did yield some

510.24 --> 513.199
new subscribers

515.44 --> 521.0390000000001
so like yeah i got the

517.76 --> 522.959
2100 mark

521.039 --> 524.48
i think for the first time so that

522.959 --> 528.399
that's nice

524.48 --> 528.399
thank you all new new subscribers

530.16 --> 533.7199999999999
hey ralph rodriguez

535.12 --> 538.16
hold on

536.24 --> 541.16
okay you guys feel better be back two

538.16 --> 541.16
minutes

666.8 --> 669.8
yo

692.72 --> 695.0400000000001
huh

696.64 --> 701.12
right i really appreciate the sentiment

698.56 --> 703.8389999999999
guys in chat

701.12 --> 703.839
i know

719.12 --> 722.0
right yeah

723.2 --> 726.2
anyway

732.32 --> 739.279
times are hard yeah i guess so

735.76 --> 741.4399999999999
well i'm gonna be eating less i

739.279 --> 743.12
i ate half a pizza yesterday and that

741.44 --> 744.72
was it

743.12 --> 747.2
and i'm probably gonna eat the other

744.72 --> 748.639
half today

747.2 --> 750.399
hey

748.639 --> 753.6800000000001
thank you bill the science denier for

750.399 --> 753.68
the five dollar super chat

756.959 --> 762.4799999999999
i appreciate it

758.72 --> 764.72
though if you really want to help

762.48 --> 768.48
please send it through paypal that

764.72 --> 768.48
that's like a world of difference

768.959 --> 772.279
if you can

775.12 --> 777.36
man

780.56 --> 784.7199999999999
i mean the way it looks now

783.44 --> 787.0400000000001
like

784.72 --> 789.36
i will probably be able to pay the rent

787.04 --> 792.399
but that also means that i'm going to be

789.36 --> 792.399
immediately broke

794.8 --> 799.519
right it might actually like the

797.519 --> 800.72
automated payment

799.519 --> 802.8
order

800.72 --> 804.48
is still on hold because it didn't go

802.8 --> 805.279
through right away so it might just do

804.48 --> 807.9200000000001
it

805.279 --> 807.92
any moment

808.0 --> 812.32
but yeah that would still mean that i

809.92 --> 814.56
have absolutely no money left for the

812.32 --> 816.72
rest of the month

814.56 --> 819.279
did this early and yeah it's not a good

816.72 --> 822.24
situation

819.279 --> 825.12
and i'm gonna have to figure out how to

822.24 --> 825.12
work through this

825.519 --> 828.399
right because

826.88 --> 829.279
literally i have

828.399 --> 831.36
yeah

829.279 --> 835.12
i used to have like

831.36 --> 835.12
some maneuvering room out there

835.519 --> 840.48
and yeah

837.92 --> 843.68
none of them have the maneuvering room

840.48 --> 846.16
left now which overall

843.68 --> 848.4799999999999
also kind of shows bit of a grim picture

846.16 --> 848.48
to me

850.959 --> 855.8
eat pasta and potatoes don't go hungry

859.68 --> 864.56
technically i can't get around on scraps

866.56 --> 873.199
it's but also like yeah

870.639 --> 874.32
all that luxury

873.199 --> 877.76
which yeah

874.32 --> 879.1990000000001
is it that much of a luxury but like

877.76 --> 881.12
drinking

879.199 --> 885.3599999999999
beers

881.12 --> 888.399
and the smoking like um

885.36 --> 891.519
yeah i don't have the room anymore now

888.399 --> 891.519
right now at least so

892.0 --> 897.6
it's gonna be like a

894.639 --> 898.9590000000001
bit of a hungry winter situation

897.6 --> 902.44
least for now

898.959 --> 902.4399999999999
the way it looks

912.8 --> 918.959
are you studying 80 12. am i doing could

915.279 --> 918.959
be better could be better man

923.199 --> 927.8
i didn't sleep very well last night

937.36 --> 944.48
and it's it's kind of weird too you know

940.079 --> 944.4799999999999
because at the same time like i did get

946.639 --> 951.279
support yes like it did work

951.36 --> 958.24
my my night owl emergency fund

956.16 --> 960.8
show and it was a pretty good show

958.24 --> 962.0790000000001
despite my

960.8 --> 963.8389999999999
kind of like

962.079 --> 966.16
yeah i wasn't

963.839 --> 968.32
top fit at the time

966.16 --> 969.92
and it's kind of embarrassing but yeah i

968.32 --> 972.48
hadn't

969.92 --> 974.7199999999999
like i basically was already drinking

972.48 --> 976.88
beer

974.72 --> 980.48
like what is it a couple of hours before

976.88 --> 983.759
that when i found out like oh [ __ ]

980.48 --> 986.72
like if i had found out before that

983.759 --> 988.5600000000001
then i wouldn't have bought the bears

986.72 --> 990.24
to stay sober

988.56 --> 993.56
so it's cut yeah

990.24 --> 993.5600000000001
it's just

997.6 --> 1003.1990000000001
gave up smokes when they were yeah it's

999.759 --> 1003.1990000000001
very expensive here too

1006.48 --> 1012.24
but i've not like really guided

1008.399 --> 1012.24
constantly smokes so

1012.959 --> 1018.8389999999999
that's not really the yeah

1015.44 --> 1018.839
i'll be alright

1024.72 --> 1028.64
huh

1025.919 --> 1031.5200000000002
okay ralph rodriguez

1028.64 --> 1031.5200000000002
that's interesting

1032.319 --> 1035.319
really

1041.919 --> 1044.16
huh

1050.72 --> 1056.0
yeah that is a that is interesting

1054.4 --> 1058.799
yeah if that works

1056.0 --> 1058.799
that will be great

1064.4 --> 1070.48
right but anyhow like

1068.48 --> 1073.039
the signs are kind of clear to me out

1070.48 --> 1073.039
there like

1075.6 --> 1079.039
the financial pressure it has been

1077.52 --> 1081.2
pushing

1079.039 --> 1085.6
because of obvious situations out there

1081.2 --> 1089.679
and now it's basically just reached here

1085.6 --> 1089.6789999999999
so i have to now adapt

1090.0 --> 1094.559
or i will blatantly perish

1092.88 --> 1096.24
and that's all and that's kind of the

1094.559 --> 1098.96
thing that i'm

1096.24 --> 1101.2
so stressed out about

1098.96 --> 1103.039
because i had been

1101.2 --> 1104.72
going

1103.039 --> 1107.12
in a very

1104.72 --> 1112.32
kind of stable setting now for a long

1107.12 --> 1112.32
time is probably my longest stable run

1114.559 --> 1119.799
and so it's like

1116.08 --> 1119.799
yeah now i have to

1123.84 --> 1128.0
get my bearings again and because it it

1126.4 --> 1130.799
can't work anymore

1128.0 --> 1133.28
like the way i've been running things so

1130.799 --> 1136.6399999999999
i'm gonna figure it out

1133.28 --> 1138.32
first off i just need to

1136.64 --> 1141.039
get this

1138.32 --> 1142.72
like this hyper nervous tension out of

1141.039 --> 1145.52
me it's like the shock

1142.72 --> 1150.08
it is a shock i guess

1145.52 --> 1153.2
because it's making me physically ill

1150.08 --> 1153.1999999999998
in like i feel like

1154.96 --> 1157.76
but yeah

1162.559 --> 1165.52
also

1163.76 --> 1166.559
now that i'm kind of

1165.52 --> 1168.72
bumped

1166.559 --> 1171.44
out of it out of that frequency i've

1168.72 --> 1173.679
been in right

1171.44 --> 1175.919
because i feel different now i don't

1173.679 --> 1179.039
know if you guys feel that from me that

1175.919 --> 1181.76
i feel different but i feel different

1179.039 --> 1185.12
and now i realize that

1181.76 --> 1185.12
i've been kind of arrogant

1185.52 --> 1190.329
[Music]

1191.6 --> 1195.12
i like had to do that

1195.42 --> 1199.28
[Music]

1196.88 --> 1202.8400000000001
because i was like i was just trying to

1199.28 --> 1202.84
maintain cohesion

1206.799 --> 1211.12
but now i feel terrible over all that

1218.0 --> 1222.88
the show is still running well i wasn't

1228.96 --> 1232.8400000000001
i wasn't gonna like quit right away this

1231.28 --> 1236.32
is not like an

1232.84 --> 1237.6
angry rage quit situation the devil's

1236.32 --> 1241.76
pulpit

1237.6 --> 1244.24
it's just that i really needed the funds

1241.76 --> 1245.36
to get my rent

1244.24 --> 1247.28
paid

1245.36 --> 1249.6789999999999
because otherwise i'll be in so much

1247.28 --> 1250.96
trouble

1249.679 --> 1253.52
and

1250.96 --> 1256.4
it also kind of made me face just my

1253.52 --> 1260.24
situation so i don't know if the early

1256.4 --> 1260.24
bird can continue the way it does

1260.96 --> 1263.8400000000001
i'll try

1265.76 --> 1271.52
i don't know man maybe this is a good

1267.6 --> 1271.52
thing you know the most punishing things

1271.679 --> 1276.96
i know from practical advice even though

1274.159 --> 1279.2800000000002
i don't feel like it now i know i can

1276.96 --> 1281.039
turn this somehow

1279.28 --> 1282.96
to my advantage

1281.039 --> 1284.64
like maybe i've just had some things

1282.96 --> 1286.559
inside of me that i

1284.64 --> 1290.72
that needed to break and i needed to

1286.559 --> 1293.44
break in order to break that

1290.72 --> 1297.76
it's kind of esoteric

1293.44 --> 1297.76
and i think maybe the arrogance is just

1299.2 --> 1302.52
i know

1304.799 --> 1312.08
isn't the dutch welfare yeah it is

1308.72 --> 1312.08
it is the devil's pulpit

1314.32 --> 1320.1589999999999
the but it's not a lot

1317.039 --> 1322.24
the rent is quite high

1320.159 --> 1324.159
and

1322.24 --> 1328.2
yeah

1324.159 --> 1328.2
it's not the only expenditure

1334.32 --> 1339.9189999999999
yeah i am considering that

1337.76 --> 1342.4
but here's the problem and it was always

1339.919 --> 1344.7990000000002
the problem

1342.4 --> 1348.4
it's not gonna guarantee me to get

1344.799 --> 1348.4
really more income

1351.679 --> 1354.88
right

1352.48 --> 1357.919
you would have to have like a pretty

1354.88 --> 1362.4
full-time job

1357.919 --> 1362.4
to basically be able to surpass

1362.96 --> 1367.28
the standard income of welfare that i

1365.919 --> 1368.24
get

1367.28 --> 1372.3999999999999
so

1368.24 --> 1372.4
because otherwise it's just taken off it

1372.84 --> 1377.36
right

1374.559 --> 1379.52
and yeah a full-time job means well a

1377.36 --> 1382.08
full-time job and that means no more

1379.52 --> 1384.32
time left and probably no more energy

1382.08 --> 1386.799
left depending on the job though

1384.32 --> 1388.48
at least at first

1386.799 --> 1390.6399999999999
so

1388.48 --> 1393.44
and i don't even know if there is

1390.64 --> 1395.44
anything out there for me that that i

1393.44 --> 1397.919
would even fit into

1395.44 --> 1400.48
because i'm a weirdo okay

1397.919 --> 1401.679
compared to most people

1400.48 --> 1404.64
like

1401.679 --> 1407.2800000000002
i don't fit in the boxes like i don't

1404.64 --> 1410.3200000000002
even fit in the boxes of normal welfare

1407.28 --> 1413.32
recipients at all

1410.32 --> 1413.32
so

1417.12 --> 1422.7199999999998
right and also when i still feel like

1420.0 --> 1425.2
this stressed out it doesn't make me a

1422.72 --> 1427.2
very good worker

1425.2 --> 1430.4
i'm gonna yeah i'm gonna probably

1427.2 --> 1434.0
irritate some people

1430.4 --> 1434.0
because i kind of feel weakish

1434.4 --> 1438.4
i don't know i'm overthinking it already

1436.64 --> 1442.0
i'm just gonna have to get through this

1438.4 --> 1442.0
situation on the short run

1442.24 --> 1447.76
and see

1443.279 --> 1451.039
like if i might be able to somehow

1447.76 --> 1452.72
work my way out of it financially

1451.039 --> 1456.64
i had originally hoped it would be

1452.72 --> 1456.64
possible purely through the support

1457.279 --> 1463.84
of well everybody out there

1460.48 --> 1465.039
and i've come quite a far away like i've

1463.84 --> 1468.559
already

1465.039 --> 1472.24
like it it seemed to work it's just

1468.559 --> 1475.6789999999999
now i have to figure out

1472.24 --> 1475.679
what can i do on my side

1483.52 --> 1486.52
anyway

1505.76 --> 1512.24
right but yeah

1507.919 --> 1514.48
if you care you can definitely help out

1512.24 --> 1517.1200000000001
by sending like even small paypal

1514.48 --> 1517.1200000000001
donations

1520.96 --> 1524.0
hey

1521.76 --> 1526.1589999999999
ralph rodriguez oh

1524.0 --> 1529.84
thank you

1526.159 --> 1529.8400000000001
thank you so much

1535.279 --> 1540.4
that's 20 euros thank you man that's

1538.799 --> 1541.679
like yeah

1540.4 --> 1544.0800000000002
when you got

1541.679 --> 1547.1200000000001
nothing numerically that matters a lot i

1544.08 --> 1547.12
thank you so much

1551.919 --> 1556.1200000000001
i really appreciate that

1559.279 --> 1562.96
right

1560.4 --> 1566.24
so yeah i don't want like this entire

1562.96 --> 1568.8400000000001
show just being about me and how

1566.24 --> 1571.2
unstable i am

1568.84 --> 1572.6399999999999
let's try to

1571.2 --> 1574.48
figure out

1572.64 --> 1576.64
something else we could talk about or

1574.48 --> 1579.1200000000001
maybe you guys just want to hear me out

1576.64 --> 1582.0800000000002
on this i mean i do need to kind of get

1579.12 --> 1582.08
it off my chest but

1582.32 --> 1588.4399999999998
like it doesn't really make a good show

1584.4 --> 1588.44
i think for others

1605.76 --> 1611.08
delivering mail for the post office hmm

1613.76 --> 1618.4
no that's funny david yeah i've done

1615.679 --> 1620.88
that before

1618.4 --> 1624.52
it it's not real it's not really that

1620.88 --> 1624.5200000000002
well paying though

1629.52 --> 1633.52
but i don't know

1632.32 --> 1635.52
maybe

1633.52 --> 1638.4
maybe yeah

1635.52 --> 1638.4
i might do that

1639.2 --> 1641.8400000000001
who knows

1643.76 --> 1649.039
yeah about rodriguez i really appreciate

1646.159 --> 1649.0390000000002
that thank you

1652.96 --> 1656.96
all right guys i've also been thinking

1654.96 --> 1659.8400000000001
like

1656.96 --> 1662.0
should i just do a

1659.84 --> 1664.559
a massive unban

1662.0 --> 1664.559
in chat

1665.279 --> 1671.039
i mean there there's many people out

1667.76 --> 1671.039
there that i've banned and

1676.32 --> 1680.0
maybe you guys

1677.76 --> 1682.64
like it the way it is right now

1680.0 --> 1684.64
but i feel sometimes like it's it's kind

1682.64 --> 1687.1200000000001
of like too vacant

1684.64 --> 1689.6000000000001
like that situation now the show ended

1687.12 --> 1691.52
yesterday

1689.6 --> 1694.48
with just

1691.52 --> 1696.6399999999999
like trolls kind of took it over

1694.48 --> 1699.919
and it got really annoying then i banned

1696.64 --> 1703.039
them and then everybody just

1699.919 --> 1703.039
almost like they left

1704.0 --> 1707.52
and i

1705.36 --> 1710.9599999999998
yeah that was even before i knew about

1707.52 --> 1712.72
my situation by the way

1710.96 --> 1715.72
but the tension was i guess already

1712.72 --> 1715.72
there

1737.52 --> 1743.08
i think i'm gonna round out the show

1739.2 --> 1743.0800000000002
early i don't feel well

1776.48 --> 1781.72
i think i might be jumping on the shower

1778.559 --> 1781.72
or something

1782.32 --> 1785.72
sorry guys

1819.52 --> 1823.399
no i don't have a hangover

1824.799 --> 1830.559
i'm just i feel really anxious

1827.919 --> 1830.5590000000002
and nervous

1831.2 --> 1835.0
i'm sorry guys

1852.0 --> 1855.0
uh

1877.76 --> 1880.76

1915.039 --> 1919.44
i will be all right eventually guys

1917.12 --> 1921.84
don't worry too much it's just the

1919.44 --> 1921.8400000000001
