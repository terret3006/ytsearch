229.12 --> 232.879
i'm feeling pretty decent

237.92 --> 241.599
right so yeah i feel like i am basically

240.799 --> 244.0
in a

241.599 --> 245.67999999999998
much in a recovery i had a

244.0 --> 247.76
chicken broccoli

245.68 --> 251.12
yesterday evening and

247.76 --> 251.12
that really hit the spot

251.92 --> 256.479
didn't go to bed too late and yes

254.08 --> 259.35900000000004
getting up kind of early again

256.479 --> 259.359
so i don't know

263.12 --> 267.92900000000003
huh

264.72 --> 267.92900000000003
[Music]

272.8 --> 276.40000000000003

276.479 --> 280.479
that's really early jess palmer

281.28 --> 284.15999999999997
tj jones

282.96 --> 286.56
yeah

284.16 --> 288.88000000000005
well tj jones has been

286.56 --> 292.4
like an anti-flat earther

288.88 --> 295.68
slash baller troll for a long time

292.4 --> 300.67999999999995
he thinks google earth is a ball

295.68 --> 300.68
he says all kinds of really stupid [ __ ]

310.0 --> 312.96
some mint here

313.52 --> 319.59999999999997
still not drinking coffee and i'm really

315.52 --> 319.59999999999997
gonna like not do that for a while

321.84 --> 325.52
also i've been noticing that it might

323.52 --> 327.039
have been

325.52 --> 330.24
accidentally

327.039 --> 330.24
overdosing a bit

330.32 --> 336.08
i don't know how severe that would be

332.639 --> 336.96000000000004
with like the vitamin d3

336.08 --> 339.68
because

336.96 --> 342.23999999999995
i got these supplements

339.68 --> 345.12
bone food complex

342.24 --> 346.16
from my stepmother during christmas

345.12 --> 348.16
and

346.16 --> 349.91900000000004
like mostly

348.16 --> 351.6
with

349.919 --> 354.0
calcium in there

351.6 --> 357.199
but it also just has a full dose of

354.0 --> 359.6
vitamin d3 and k2 in there

357.199 --> 362.16
so i've been kind of taking that double

359.6 --> 364.24
for a while i wonder if that had

362.16 --> 367.03900000000004
any kind of negative impact i don't even

364.24 --> 369.44
know

367.039 --> 371.59999999999997
i really just noticed that

369.44 --> 373.44
anyway

371.6 --> 375.68
i'm uh yeah preventing that from

373.44 --> 377.199
happening again so i basically the

375.68 --> 379.199
normal

377.199 --> 383.12
supplements i take

379.199 --> 385.12
separate k2 and d3 i'm

383.12 --> 388.639
yeah holding off on that

385.12 --> 391.199
and and just going at the

388.639 --> 392.639
singular formula

391.199 --> 395.639
in the morning

392.639 --> 395.639
right

396.479 --> 402.8
a tweaker with a million dollars for a

399.68 --> 402.8
flat earth map what

405.28 --> 409.039
okay wrath i don't know what you're

406.639 --> 410.319
talking about exactly but

409.039 --> 412.71999999999997
sure

410.319 --> 412.72
anyway

418.08 --> 423.599
i had a really

420.56 --> 426.4
great chat over skype with rasta hat

423.599 --> 426.4
again yesterday

427.28 --> 430.23999999999995
it was interesting

431.199 --> 436.72
and

433.039 --> 441.199
oh yes i did actually

436.72 --> 441.199
download and watch the matrix 4

441.759 --> 447.599
and it was not exactly

444.8 --> 450.24
what i expected it was going to be

447.599 --> 452.71999999999997
but it definitely had traits that i

450.24 --> 455.44
thought it was gonna have

452.72 --> 455.44000000000005
so it is

456.8 --> 460.319
it's not as bad as i thought it was

459.039 --> 462.4
gonna be

460.319 --> 464.879
and really the most surprising part is

462.4 --> 467.52
that i thought that

464.879 --> 468.56
keanu reeves actually did a really great

467.52 --> 470.96
job

468.56 --> 473.68
he was convincingly

470.96 --> 474.71999999999997
an older neo that's has gone through

473.68 --> 477.36
like

474.72 --> 480.08000000000004
the burden of escapism

477.36 --> 483.28000000000003
so there was like neo the old neo but

480.08 --> 486.24
with psychology on top of it

483.28 --> 488.0
so yeah yesterday i was all ranting

486.24 --> 490.0
against

488.0 --> 492.879
against keanu reeves

490.0 --> 496.16
like just stay wooden and all that i

492.879 --> 498.72
thought he did that actually quite well

496.16 --> 500.96000000000004
so yeah i felt a bit weird

498.72 --> 503.44000000000005
noticing that his acting wasn't actually

500.96 --> 505.19899999999996
that bad in the matrix four

503.44 --> 507.599
after i'd done all of that rant

505.199 --> 509.44
yesterday so maybe there's some hope for

507.599 --> 513.12
him after all

509.44 --> 513.12
but it really stood out to me that

514.159 --> 519.519
if he somehow

516.959 --> 521.76
acts like that and kind of

519.519 --> 525.04
is emotionally more suppressive but

521.76 --> 527.76
still expressive and a bit little

525.04 --> 530.64
that that just really works well for him

527.76 --> 530.64
and his appearance

531.44 --> 534.6
all right

537.68 --> 540.64
hey pg crew shank i thought you'd like

539.92 --> 541.8389999999999
it

540.64 --> 544.3199999999999
like

541.839 --> 544.32
yeah yeah

546.0 --> 550.8
no he was it was fine like

548.72 --> 553.279
pretty much the entire movie it wasn't

550.8 --> 556.4799999999999
great but it was fine

553.279 --> 559.519
and it was also interesting because

556.48 --> 561.6800000000001
like the script writers had obviously

559.519 --> 564.48
really thought about like

561.68 --> 566.399
the evolution of what was

564.48 --> 568.64
or what had happened

566.399 --> 571.12
in the previous matrix films

568.64 --> 572.8
like technological evolution very

571.12 --> 576.32
blatantly

572.8 --> 577.3599999999999
and a new setting

576.32 --> 581.12
and

577.36 --> 583.36
i thought that was like yeah

581.12 --> 585.12
that was pretty interesting

583.36 --> 587.6
in a way like they really kind of

585.12 --> 589.839
expanded on the universe

587.6 --> 592.08
of it

589.839 --> 594.1600000000001
on the other hand

592.08 --> 595.6800000000001
like especially the first half of the

594.16 --> 598.7199999999999
movie it was just

595.68 --> 601.68
so many weird things in there

598.72 --> 605.279
like they constantly showed

601.68 --> 607.68
flashbacks from the trilogy

605.279 --> 610.32
and that felt like

607.68 --> 612.88
totally out of place

610.32 --> 616.0790000000001
because it was happening too much

612.88 --> 618.64
like in some spots if they did like a

616.079 --> 621.04
short flashback like a literal flashback

618.64 --> 622.88
of like one or two seconds and then left

621.04 --> 625.12
it to that that would have been pretty

622.88 --> 626.079
cool but at some point they just almost

625.12 --> 629.36
like

626.079 --> 629.3599999999999
they just kept on

629.44 --> 633.839
like an art

630.839 --> 636.8000000000001
expose keep on referencing like oh look

633.839 --> 641.2
this is just like in the under movie oh

636.8 --> 643.92
look this is and that like got annoying

641.2 --> 646.0790000000001
so it wasn't perfect but yeah

643.92 --> 649.12
they did that they went a bit overboard

646.079 --> 651.68
with that it gave off this like rococo

649.12 --> 653.12
type feel it's kind of to be expected

651.68 --> 655.12
from

653.12 --> 656.8
wachowski sisters

655.12 --> 660.32
or it's it's one it's only one of them

656.8 --> 663.1999999999999
that's made this one so i've heard

660.32 --> 664.88
so that was a bit annoying

663.2 --> 667.6800000000001
but

664.88 --> 667.68
yeah also

667.92 --> 673.04
the psychiatrist guy

671.04 --> 674.88
like i didn't even recognize who the

673.04 --> 677.12
actor was at first which is a good thing

674.88 --> 680.32
that means that he's actually

677.12 --> 682.72
redeemable but as soon as he they they

680.32 --> 685.6
basically poured him in a situation

682.72 --> 689.12
where he good gamma spazz out again

685.6 --> 690.0790000000001
because that character that actor always

689.12 --> 691.12
plays

690.079 --> 694.64
mega

691.12 --> 697.2
mega games every single time i see him

694.64 --> 699.1999999999999
very annoying it's like oh no not him

697.2 --> 701.279
again that means it's going to be a game

699.2 --> 704.5600000000001
it's going to be a game off and it

701.279 --> 707.279
always is always i've never seen him in

704.56 --> 710.88
any kind of movie where he doesn't play

707.279 --> 710.88
some kind of raging gamma

711.04 --> 716.959
the analyst right

713.44 --> 720.5600000000001
god is the annoying and for some reason

716.959 --> 723.4399999999999
they put him into like this

720.56 --> 724.4799999999999
they gave him a special power of super

723.44 --> 725.2790000000001
speed

724.48 --> 728.5600000000001
like

725.279 --> 731.6
the flash in marvel movies and that was

728.56 --> 734.959
like completely unnecessary like because

731.6 --> 736.0
all that he filled that that special

734.959 --> 738.7199999999999
time

736.0 --> 741.76
special effect with was

738.72 --> 744.88
bragging like a gamma and that was just

741.76 --> 745.76
really annoying like dude shut the [ __ ]

744.88 --> 747.92
up

745.76 --> 750.0
you whining

747.92 --> 752.16
whining gamma

750.0 --> 753.839
and that really annoyed me

752.16 --> 756.079
but

753.839 --> 757.6
on the other hand there were some really

756.079 --> 760.88
brilliant scenes

757.6 --> 763.6800000000001
with him including like the time where

760.88 --> 766.48
neil was standing in front of the mirror

763.68 --> 767.76
like as he was as he just received the

766.48 --> 770.0790000000001
red pill

767.76 --> 770.959
and then he sees through the mirror the

770.079 --> 772.399
room

770.959 --> 773.8389999999999
a room with

772.399 --> 776.959
the analyst

773.839 --> 778.9590000000001
who then tries to gaslight him this is

776.959 --> 780.399
an hallucination

778.959 --> 783.279
and that

780.399 --> 786.079
was freaking brilliant

783.279 --> 786.88
that was really really awesome i was

786.079 --> 788.0
like

786.88 --> 792.079
dude

788.0 --> 794.0
that's so psycho because

792.079 --> 796.7199999999999
like what the [ __ ] do you do when

794.0 --> 798.72
literally a hallucination is trying to

796.72 --> 801.36
pull you through a mirror saying this

798.72 --> 803.9200000000001
isn't real this isn't real wow it is

801.36 --> 805.92
freaking surreal that was just genius

803.92 --> 806.88
that was like one of those little bits

805.92 --> 809.4399999999999
again

806.88 --> 810.48
that really offset the other annoying

809.44 --> 813.2790000000001
moments

810.48 --> 815.839
and so the entire movie was kind of that

813.279 --> 815.8389999999999
it was like

816.079 --> 821.8389999999999
lots of stuff like scatter gunning you

818.959 --> 823.4399999999999
with all these things everywhere and oh

821.839 --> 825.7600000000001
look at the new technology oh look at

823.44 --> 829.6
this oh we're gonna do that oh

825.76 --> 831.68
and still stylish it was a bit like

829.6 --> 833.12
felt a bit rushed in a way but now not

831.68 --> 836.16
rushed

833.12 --> 838.639
it's just a bit cluster [ __ ]

836.16 --> 840.56
filled up with a lot of stuff

838.639 --> 843.199
and it didn't necessarily all connect

840.56 --> 844.8
together perfectly it wasn't like a

843.199 --> 848.079
uniform

844.8 --> 850.959
story as much as the original matrix

848.079 --> 854.16
movies were which were really

850.959 --> 856.8
like about the mission in the moment and

854.16 --> 857.92
what's the next step here it was all

856.8 --> 858.8
more like

857.92 --> 861.199
stuff

858.8 --> 862.7199999999999
technically now i don't even fully

861.199 --> 865.199
remember

862.72 --> 867.76
half the movie because of that while

865.199 --> 870.56
with the matrixes

867.76 --> 873.4399999999999
like every every time i watched it the

870.56 --> 875.5189999999999
first every movie i've watched back then

873.44 --> 876.72
i just completely remembered everything

875.519 --> 878.8
that happened

876.72 --> 882.0790000000001
and even the order that it happened in

878.8 --> 884.959
with this one it's like really weird and

882.079 --> 886.6389999999999
mixed up and [ __ ]

884.959 --> 889.199
spoiler alert

886.639 --> 891.519
well i'm trying not to spoil it i'm just

889.199 --> 895.199
trying to give you an analysis of my

891.519 --> 895.199
experience here sorry about that

896.24 --> 899.839
you haven't seen it yet sorry about that

900.24 --> 904.88
i'm not gonna spoil everything i'm not

901.839 --> 904.8800000000001
gonna spoil like

904.959 --> 908.7199999999999
the the details but

909.199 --> 914.0
i thought that keanu reeves was pretty

911.279 --> 916.32
interesting and it

914.0 --> 918.24
and like yeah there was like

916.32 --> 919.7600000000001
some elements of tragedy but it's to be

918.24 --> 920.79
expected

919.76 --> 923.97
and

920.79 --> 923.9699999999999
[Music]

925.279 --> 930.0
yeah it was confusing in ways also i

928.48 --> 932.32
thought that like

930.0 --> 934.48
some of the early scenes where they

932.32 --> 934.48
like

934.88 --> 939.36
yeah

936.48 --> 941.36
it's a complicated movie

939.36 --> 943.6
like i'd have to watch it again very

941.36 --> 946.0
carefully

943.6 --> 946.0
because

946.32 --> 951.759
at the first part you don't really know

948.399 --> 952.88
what it's gonna turn into

951.759 --> 956.8000000000001
right you

952.88 --> 959.68
and it seems like they're they're just

956.8 --> 962.959
like trying to deconstruct the entire

959.68 --> 965.04
memory of the earlier movies which are

962.959 --> 966.959
in the memory

965.04 --> 969.92
of

966.959 --> 972.0
of keanu reeves character

969.92 --> 974.4799999999999
and they kind of like it's all about his

972.0 --> 977.839
psychology even through the trailers

974.48 --> 977.839
that becomes kind of obvious

978.24 --> 984.5600000000001
but it was like yeah

981.12 --> 987.839
a bit annoying but then afterward

984.56 --> 989.8389999999999
it seems almost logical

987.839 --> 992.399
that it was like that they even kind of

989.839 --> 994.9590000000001
explain

992.399 --> 997.519
basically what had been going on

994.959 --> 1000.399
but i'd have to watch the movie again

997.519 --> 1002.8
carefully to real because it was it's

1000.399 --> 1005.279
been left in my memory just a bit blurry

1002.8 --> 1005.279
it's weird

1005.6 --> 1008.839
it's weird

1013.279 --> 1018.72
right but yeah it was not as bad as i

1016.56 --> 1021.4399999999999
expected

1018.72 --> 1023.6
and i i really anticipated that keanu

1021.44 --> 1027.439
reeves was gonna screw it up because

1023.6 --> 1030.079
he's like been on a real bad roll

1027.439 --> 1031.6000000000001
with this with this acting career in my

1030.079 --> 1034.079
opinion

1031.6 --> 1037.12
you might have a very different opinion

1034.079 --> 1040.319
just anybody watching this out there

1037.12 --> 1044.0
but this was actually like yeah wow you

1040.319 --> 1045.52
he actually still got

1044.0 --> 1047.199
the matrix

1045.52 --> 1048.799
and that that was

1047.199 --> 1050.559
that was relieving

1048.799 --> 1052.32
it was a relief

1050.559 --> 1054.16
means there's still some hope for the

1052.32 --> 1055.28
guy

1054.16 --> 1057.52
anyway

1055.28 --> 1057.52
uh

1058.32 --> 1063.6789999999999
right one scene and it's not going to be

1060.559 --> 1063.6789999999999
too much of a spoiler

1064.16 --> 1067.2
was

1065.76 --> 1069.919
there's like a cameo with the

1067.2 --> 1072.32
merovingian and i freaking thought that

1069.919 --> 1073.2800000000002
scene was amazing

1072.32 --> 1075.52
and

1073.28 --> 1078.799
that yeah they should have and i've

1075.52 --> 1080.72
heard other reviewers about this movie

1078.799 --> 1083.679
say the same thing they should have

1080.72 --> 1084.48
filled the movie more with that sort of

1083.679 --> 1086.16
thing

1084.48 --> 1088.799
where old characters

1086.16 --> 1091.52
would come back with their evolved

1088.799 --> 1094.24
reaction to everything that's happened

1091.52 --> 1095.679
they did do some of that and it was

1094.24 --> 1097.84
pretty good

1095.679 --> 1101.2
but yeah they didn't

1097.84 --> 1104.3999999999999
do it in full and so it's kind of

1101.2 --> 1106.72
stands out that not all of the

1104.4 --> 1109.52
characters basically returned i'm not

1106.72 --> 1111.84
gonna spoil it

1109.52 --> 1111.84
right

1115.6 --> 1119.52
but yeah it was still

1118.16 --> 1121.3600000000001
interesting

1119.52 --> 1123.6
it

1121.36 --> 1126.799
it's not like

1123.6 --> 1128.8799999999999
a literal the matrix four it was more

1126.799 --> 1133.039
like a

1128.88 --> 1134.7990000000002
a reboot slash continuation that was

1133.039 --> 1136.799
actually

1134.799 --> 1137.6
not bad

1136.799 --> 1139.52
right

1137.6 --> 1141.6789999999999
it's very hard for me to pinpoint

1139.52 --> 1142.559
exactly what my opinion about this movie

1141.679 --> 1145.1200000000001
is

1142.559 --> 1148.0
but i was happily surprised in in

1145.12 --> 1151.6
multiple ways and like even the annoying

1148.0 --> 1154.64
parts were very well offset

1151.6 --> 1154.6399999999999
with good parts

1154.799 --> 1157.76
so yeah definitely a movie worth

1156.72 --> 1159.28
watching

1157.76 --> 1162.72
especially if you're a fan of the

1159.28 --> 1162.72
original matrix movies

1163.84 --> 1170.3999999999999
it's also i've noticed that the trailer

1167.84 --> 1173.1999999999998
that i've the trailers i've seen

1170.4 --> 1175.6000000000001
didn't really do it justice

1173.2 --> 1175.6000000000001
they did

1176.24 --> 1181.039
like i thought the movies were better

1178.24 --> 1181.039
than trailers

1181.28 --> 1186.6399999999999
the movie was better than trailers were

1184.08 --> 1188.08
right anyway

1186.64 --> 1190.8400000000001
they should have called it matrix

1188.08 --> 1192.799
rebooted i agree

1190.84 --> 1194.48
absolutely

1192.799 --> 1196.6399999999999
absolutely they should have called it

1194.48 --> 1198.32
that but who knows maybe there will be a

1196.64 --> 1200.88
follow-up movie and they'll call that

1198.32 --> 1204.48
matrix rebooted

1200.88 --> 1208.4
because they yeah they left it

1204.48 --> 1212.159
very open like it it's not

1208.4 --> 1216.72
it does seem like yeah a new startup

1212.159 --> 1216.72
like it could be another trilogy again

1216.96 --> 1220.559
all right hello that flat fellow thanks

1218.559 --> 1222.08
for the 99 cent super chat donation slow

1220.559 --> 1223.9189999999999
mo moon buggy

1222.08 --> 1225.9189999999999
good to see you

1223.919 --> 1228.64
stop the traffic in my rasta hat

1225.919 --> 1228.64
lumberjack

1231.2 --> 1235.919
sorry again about the spoilers steamy

1233.6 --> 1237.6789999999999
traveler i

1235.919 --> 1240.72
i think i didn't

1237.679 --> 1240.72
didn't ruin it

1240.799 --> 1245.9189999999999
maybe a couple of scenes that i

1242.4 --> 1245.919
described but it's not gonna be

1246.72 --> 1252.24
it's yeah i i didn't like

1249.679 --> 1254.88
reveal any direct story

1252.24 --> 1256.96
things it's more like certain scenarios

1254.88 --> 1259.1200000000001
that were just like whoa this is awesome

1256.96 --> 1262.64
and other scenarios were like oh my god

1259.12 --> 1264.799
they should have just not done that

1262.64 --> 1267.2800000000002
right that's pretty much all that i've

1264.799 --> 1268.24
talked about more style issues and all

1267.28 --> 1270.72
that

1268.24 --> 1271.84
so don't worry

1270.72 --> 1274.08
dude

1271.84 --> 1276.9599999999998
i wouldn't even know fully how to spoil

1274.08 --> 1278.96
it because i don't even remember half

1276.96 --> 1282.72
the movie

1278.96 --> 1282.72
like what was actually happening

1284.799 --> 1289.32
bob saget died what

1294.159 --> 1298.7990000000002
right so all that i need to know now is

1296.64 --> 1302.5200000000002
what was his last

1298.799 --> 1302.52
not funny joke

1310.96 --> 1318.3600000000001
dies at 65 really 65

1315.039 --> 1318.36
are you sure

1328.96 --> 1332.559
all right you have to come watch it a

1330.559 --> 1335.2
couple times yeah i'm gonna watch it

1332.559 --> 1336.96
again somewhere probably not really

1335.2 --> 1341.2
quickly

1336.96 --> 1343.28
somewhere in the next week or something

1341.2 --> 1344.8400000000001
or maybe i'll just watch it again if i

1343.28 --> 1348.799
really feel like

1344.84 --> 1351.039
it he had a show earlier last night he

1348.799 --> 1351.039
did

1351.2 --> 1355.44
did he i didn't know he was still on

1352.88 --> 1355.44
television

1355.919 --> 1359.0
all right

1386.32 --> 1391.0
that's unusually young

1408.799 --> 1413.559
hmm

1410.559 --> 1413.559
weird

1424.08 --> 1428.3999999999999
he oh but

1426.159 --> 1430.88
are you alleging that slow mo moon buggy

1428.4 --> 1433.039
or is the half there been because i was

1430.88 --> 1435.2
gonna ask like did he get

1433.039 --> 1437.44
any kind of booster or something you

1435.2 --> 1437.44
know

1439.6 --> 1445.48
so why would he do that

1441.6 --> 1445.48
yeah by the way there's still

1446.47 --> 1452.48
[Music]

1449.679 --> 1452.48
unfortunately

1454.24 --> 1459.6
although they are kind of almost done so

1456.799 --> 1462.1589999999999
i think that probably

1459.6 --> 1464.08
after this next weekend

1462.159 --> 1466.72
or hopefully in the next few days

1464.08 --> 1466.72
they'll be done

1467.279 --> 1470.36
yesterday

1468.48 --> 1471.679
saturday there was almost no

1470.36 --> 1474.3999999999999
[Music]

1471.679 --> 1474.4
no noises

1477.039 --> 1481.12
he alleged it

1478.88 --> 1481.1200000000001
what

1481.36 --> 1485.52
okay so he he even hinted at it himself

1484.32 --> 1488.1589999999999
right

1485.52 --> 1488.1589999999999
what a fool

1493.84 --> 1496.8799999999999
haven't said why

1495.44 --> 1499.52
good riddance

1496.88 --> 1502.7990000000002
why was he so bad i'd have no idea i

1499.52 --> 1505.12
haven't seen bob saget

1502.799 --> 1505.12
since

1505.84 --> 1510.08
what is his funniest home video so i

1508.0 --> 1513.559
have no idea what he's been up to or

1510.08 --> 1513.559
what he's like

1514.32 --> 1518.9189999999999
oh bex good to see you

1531.52 --> 1537.039
all right

1532.96 --> 1537.039
oh but yeah by the way hello jess palmer

1538.48 --> 1545.2
what do i think about the terminator is

1541.36 --> 1545.1999999999998
the sequel i don't know what that means

1546.72 --> 1552.32
is there a new terminator movie again i

1549.44 --> 1552.3200000000002
haven't seen it yet

1553.2 --> 1557.799
you made jokes about the ending boosted

1560.48 --> 1564.96
it was a super creep for real yeah he

1562.559 --> 1567.2
had weird [ __ ] going on

1564.96 --> 1570.32
inside of his head man

1567.2 --> 1574.24
like the way his eyes were yeah he was

1570.32 --> 1574.24
he had very creepy traits

1575.84 --> 1581.84
a weirdo but yeah

1578.799 --> 1584.72
i don't know too much about him but

1581.84 --> 1587.279
anyway apparently he died so

1584.72 --> 1587.279
that's that

1589.8 --> 1592.99
[Music]

1595.44 --> 1600.48
maybe he thought that entire

1597.6 --> 1602.559
v situation and the boosters and all

1600.48 --> 1604.32
that maybe he just thought it was all

1602.559 --> 1605.84
nonsense and he just thought like nah

1604.32 --> 1609.12
that's all fine

1605.84 --> 1609.12
and then he actually got a

1609.52 --> 1615.039
real bad one

1611.2 --> 1617.44
oh talking about which there is a

1615.039 --> 1619.919
interview that's very interesting that i

1617.44 --> 1621.6000000000001
bumped into on dutch side but it is in

1619.919 --> 1624.159
english

1621.6 --> 1624.1589999999999
the video

1625.039 --> 1629.76
probably it's interesting worth watching

1626.88 --> 1631.679
this because it also is more detailed

1629.76 --> 1633.279
background information on how on the

1631.679 --> 1635.919
distribution

1633.279 --> 1636.72
of the batches of these

1635.919 --> 1638.72
so

1636.72 --> 1641.52
that this is a really interesting

1638.72 --> 1643.3600000000001
detailed video

1641.52 --> 1645.36
interview it's a interview not a

1643.36 --> 1646.399
presentation but

1645.36 --> 1648.7199999999998
yeah

1646.399 --> 1651.52
if you want to know more detail

1648.72 --> 1653.6000000000001
he said a lot of good things in there

1651.52 --> 1655.52
and yeah

1653.6 --> 1657.6
i haven't finished watching the whole

1655.52 --> 1660.399
thing when half of it it was really good

1657.6 --> 1660.399
worth watching

1661.6 --> 1668.8799999999999
right also yeah basically there is there

1665.039 --> 1670.32
are processes being started up

1668.88 --> 1671.1200000000001
against the

1670.32 --> 1674.48
c

1671.12 --> 1674.4799999999998
and v situation

1674.96 --> 1682.2
right

1676.72 --> 1682.2
is terminator the sequel to the matrix

1688.24 --> 1692.24
no

1689.84 --> 1694.1589999999999
no that makes no sense no it would be a

1692.24 --> 1698.08
prequel

1694.159 --> 1698.88
would be the prequel to the matrix

1698.08 --> 1700.48
right

1698.88 --> 1703.3600000000001
you have the terminators

1700.48 --> 1705.2
set up machine taking over

1703.36 --> 1706.799
then pretty much

1705.2 --> 1708.88
when you could say like oh the

1706.799 --> 1711.36
terminator

1708.88 --> 1714.64
humanities failing after all

1711.36 --> 1717.12
even with john connor and then he

1714.64 --> 1718.3990000000001
in a desperate bid darkens the sky or

1717.12 --> 1719.7199999999998
something to

1718.399 --> 1723.12
to stop the

1719.72 --> 1724.96
metastasizing machine

1723.12 --> 1727.4399999999998
world that's grown like it's really

1724.96 --> 1730.3990000000001
growing almost as big as you see in the

1727.44 --> 1731.44
matrix in the out in the real world

1730.399 --> 1733.4399999999998
right

1731.44 --> 1735.679
and then he does that

1733.44 --> 1737.52
and then they like get all captured and

1735.679 --> 1739.52
like the machines start capturing them

1737.52 --> 1743.52
and putting them in pots right

1739.52 --> 1745.279
so the terminator like the future

1743.52 --> 1747.9189999999999
of the where the machines break out in

1745.279 --> 1752.24
the terminator could be the prequel to

1747.919 --> 1753.76
the matrix not the other way around

1752.24 --> 1756.88
like they could

1753.76 --> 1760.32
decide to do that you know if the

1756.88 --> 1760.3200000000002
what is it the cameron

1760.64 --> 1764.64
what does it know his name again the the

1762.559 --> 1767.12
guy who made the terminator

1764.64 --> 1768.24
freaking out so bad with names sarah

1767.12 --> 1770.399
sorry

1768.24 --> 1771.36
but the movie director if he would be

1770.399 --> 1773.6789999999999
willing

1771.36 --> 1776.32
to basically like oh

1773.679 --> 1778.3200000000002
combine franchises

1776.32 --> 1780.96
or attempt like a connection from

1778.32 --> 1784.799
franchise connection with the wachowski

1780.96 --> 1787.6000000000001
sisters he they might be able to do that

1784.799 --> 1787.6
i think yeah

1788.24 --> 1794.679
would it really be worth it though

1791.279 --> 1794.679
i don't know

1835.039 --> 1837.84
all right

1851.279 --> 1854.559
yeah the way to terminate the movies

1852.88 --> 1856.3200000000002
yeah but peter khrushcheck you got to

1854.559 --> 1859.6789999999999
realize also that the terminator

1856.32 --> 1860.48
franchise has become highly fragmented

1859.679 --> 1862.24
right

1860.48 --> 1864.3990000000001
it's a big difference

1862.24 --> 1865.919
big difference with the matrix the

1864.399 --> 1867.1999999999998
matrix is

1865.919 --> 1869.44
so far

1867.2 --> 1872.559
everything that's been made has been

1869.44 --> 1875.3600000000001
like part of the entire thing the entire

1872.559 --> 1878.24
story even like the animatrix it's all

1875.36 --> 1880.24
been made very seriously

1878.24 --> 1881.919
like it's a puzzle it's supposed to be

1880.24 --> 1883.36
fitting with the terminator after

1881.919 --> 1886.159
terminator 2

1883.36 --> 1888.32
they tried some other pro they tried

1886.159 --> 1890.8400000000001
some things and then like the movies

1888.32 --> 1892.399
after that ignored that

1890.84 --> 1893.6
all

1892.399 --> 1895.84
and then

1893.6 --> 1898.399
another movie maker did another

1895.84 --> 1901.12
terminator movie that ignored a lot

1898.399 --> 1904.399
again so they the terminator just

1901.12 --> 1906.399
constantly like they

1904.399 --> 1909.4399999999998
like start a new reality

1906.399 --> 1912.799
out of nowhere constantly with roughly

1909.44 --> 1915.3600000000001
the same setup so it's very different

1912.799 --> 1918.1589999999999
than the than the matrix

1915.36 --> 1920.6399999999999
universe which is much more

1918.159 --> 1922.48
concise and lockstep and and truly made

1920.64 --> 1923.919
to be one story

1922.48 --> 1927.2
right

1923.919 --> 1928.24
so yeah is that worth it

1927.2 --> 1931.1200000000001
maybe

1928.24 --> 1932.3990000000001
i think that it probably at this point

1931.12 --> 1935.279
in time it

1932.399 --> 1940.2399999999998
somebody might make like a

1935.279 --> 1940.24
sort of more like a fan movie about it

1941.12 --> 1946.9599999999998
they could maybe

1943.919 --> 1948.7990000000002
it's like more like a fanfic type movie

1946.96 --> 1950.799
where it is

1948.799 --> 1953.279
like a yeah

1950.799 --> 1953.279
shown

1953.44 --> 1957.8400000000001
how the terminator universe when it goes

1955.84 --> 1960.1589999999999
wrong turns into

1957.84 --> 1963.84
a matrix and that yeah

1960.159 --> 1963.8400000000001
somebody could make that

1973.279 --> 1975.679
all right

1975.76 --> 1980.96
like there is certainly basically the

1978.159 --> 1983.1200000000001
the connections are there it could

1980.96 --> 1984.32
it could be clicked together

1983.12 --> 1986.559
right

1984.32 --> 1989.6
it wouldn't make it one franchise

1986.559 --> 1993.279
because still like terminator is just

1989.6 --> 1996.0
the pre-session it is the transition

1993.279 --> 1998.08
from still normal human society to when

1996.0 --> 2001.76
the machine's taken over

1998.08 --> 2003.4399999999998
the matrix is always about the machines

2001.76 --> 2006.559
have taken over

2003.44 --> 2010.0
and encapsulated humanity and then they

2006.559 --> 2013.039
wake up from that and return it's like

2010.0 --> 2016.799
the matrix franchise is about the return

2013.039 --> 2020.32
of humanity in a machine-dominated world

2016.799 --> 2020.32
and it's always going to stay like that

2020.799 --> 2024.559
they need to stop using arnold

2022.24 --> 2026.799
schwarzenegger

2024.559 --> 2026.799
well

2028.0 --> 2031.039
i don't think so

2031.279 --> 2036.0
not necessary i think arnold

2032.72 --> 2036.0
schwarzenegger is like

2036.72 --> 2041.1200000000001
it is part of

2038.559 --> 2041.12
what it is

2041.519 --> 2046.3990000000001
i mean they could potentially separate

2044.24 --> 2051.119
it from him and started new

2046.399 --> 2054.0
but then i don't know it would just be

2051.119 --> 2055.76
another sci-fi movie almost like how

2054.0 --> 2057.28
yeah it's difficult

2055.76 --> 2060.5600000000004
right

2057.28 --> 2063.119
because arnold schwarzenegger is tied in

2060.56 --> 2066.24
to the terminator franchise it's it's

2063.119 --> 2067.359
difficult to actually now separate it

2066.24 --> 2070.0
again

2067.359 --> 2072.159
with neo that yeah with keanu reeves

2070.0 --> 2075.839
that's the same issue but

2072.159 --> 2075.839
it's working out they're just making a

2076.159 --> 2080.48
an evolved world

2078.399 --> 2082.3199999999997
of the matrix and and running with that

2080.48 --> 2083.119
and they can make another trilogy out of

2082.32 --> 2085.839
this

2083.119 --> 2089.679
if they wanted to

2085.839 --> 2092.0
right piano is not that old

2089.679 --> 2094.639
gotta realize that the terminator the

2092.0 --> 2096.72
first movie where arnold

2094.639 --> 2097.599
debuted

2096.72 --> 2100.48
it

2097.599 --> 2103.8
that was in the 80s it's much longer ago

2100.48 --> 2103.8
than the matrix

2105.76 --> 2110.88
oh talking about movies

2108.24 --> 2110.8799999999997
i also

2111.04 --> 2117.92
when my computer was broken

2114.0 --> 2120.8
i have actually continued watching the

2117.92 --> 2121.6800000000003
picard series

2120.8 --> 2124.48
which

2121.68 --> 2127.1189999999997
i had watched like one or two episodes

2124.48 --> 2130.2400000000002
of a long time ago and then it really

2127.119 --> 2131.76
hit a bad spot and i was like repulsed

2130.24 --> 2133.7599999999998
for some reason

2131.76 --> 2136.5600000000004
discontinued watching it well i

2133.76 --> 2139.76
continued watching it now

2136.56 --> 2141.839
or re-watched it pretty much

2139.76 --> 2142.8390000000004
and actually it was

2141.839 --> 2145.2
pretty

2142.839 --> 2149.04
cool and very

2145.2 --> 2152.3999999999996
nostalgic in it in a durable way

2149.04 --> 2154.88
so i was actually kind of surprised that

2152.4 --> 2157.76
i was so pissed off

2154.88 --> 2159.76
first time i tried to watch that

2157.76 --> 2162.5600000000004
when i watch the whole thing it was

2159.76 --> 2163.5200000000004
actually just really pleasant

2162.56 --> 2164.96
with

2163.52 --> 2167.359
like

2164.96 --> 2169.76
yeah it was good it was

2167.359 --> 2172.0
it was really still

2169.76 --> 2174.88
the star trek universe with that sorry

2172.0 --> 2177.28
for switching movies so quickly

2174.88 --> 2179.599
but yeah i did appreciate it it's just

2177.28 --> 2182.2400000000002
that in the last episode it was kind of

2179.599 --> 2185.839
annoying they did it but that's typical

2182.24 --> 2187.4399999999996
star trek next generation by the

2185.839 --> 2189.44
right is

2187.44 --> 2192.16
did they like to do that in star trek

2189.44 --> 2194.56
sometimes like make a drama like oh he's

2192.16 --> 2198.96
dying oh

2194.56 --> 2201.359
and then like out of nowhere oh we just

2198.96 --> 2202.64
cloned him

2201.359 --> 2205.44
afresh

2202.64 --> 2206.72
totally out of nowhere and that's re i

2205.44 --> 2209.28
hate it

2206.72 --> 2211.04
i hate it when hollywood does that i

2209.28 --> 2213.0400000000004
always hated it

2211.04 --> 2214.88
it was annoying it was completely

2213.04 --> 2216.96
unnecessary

2214.88 --> 2219.2000000000003
they should have just

2216.96 --> 2219.2
not

2219.28 --> 2223.119
gone there not like that

2223.52 --> 2228.64
but the rest of the series i thought

2225.44 --> 2231.76
actually was really good i was very

2228.64 --> 2231.7599999999998
pleasantly surprised

2233.04 --> 2238.32
so yeah star trek picard

2236.0 --> 2240.32
that first season

2238.32 --> 2242.32
i don't know why the first two episodes

2240.32 --> 2244.8
just really robbed me the wrong way

2242.32 --> 2247.119
somehow

2244.8 --> 2249.52
but then as the rest of the series

2247.119 --> 2252.2400000000002
continued there were a lot of like

2249.52 --> 2254.24
old characters from the next generation

2252.24 --> 2257.1189999999997
and others

2254.24 --> 2258.8799999999997
other star trek series

2257.119 --> 2260.4
that were drawn in

2258.88 --> 2263.119
and

2260.4 --> 2266.2400000000002
they were all excellent

2263.119 --> 2267.76
they were great i really liked them back

2266.24 --> 2269.04
in it

2267.76 --> 2271.3590000000004
and

2269.04 --> 2273.2
i also thought that like even the main

2271.359 --> 2275.7599999999998
characters were i first thought like oh

2273.2 --> 2278.3999999999996
my god what are you gonna do now

2275.76 --> 2280.6400000000003
it's not gonna be some sjw [ __ ] or

2278.4 --> 2284.1600000000003
anything right but no it wasn't it

2280.64 --> 2287.52
totally wasn't like that

2284.16 --> 2288.64
i even got a bit of a feel about it that

2287.52 --> 2290.079
they

2288.64 --> 2294.0789999999997
attempted to

2290.079 --> 2297.2000000000003
to graft in a bit of the feel

2294.079 --> 2298.96
of firefly the firefly series and

2297.2 --> 2300.64
actually

2298.96 --> 2302.32
successfully

2300.64 --> 2304.0789999999997
at first i thought like oh god really

2302.32 --> 2307.6800000000003
you're gonna try that

2304.079 --> 2308.88
but then actually it kind of worked

2307.68 --> 2309.9199999999996
and

2308.88 --> 2312.48
yeah

2309.92 --> 2314.64
i thought that the series was overall

2312.48 --> 2315.92
better than discovery

2314.64 --> 2318.16
entirely

2315.92 --> 2320.56
like a lot better

2318.16 --> 2324.0789999999997
and i wonder is there gonna be another

2320.56 --> 2324.0789999999997
season coming after this

2324.56 --> 2329.92
because they did leave room for that

2326.4 --> 2329.92
like it could continue

2332.72 --> 2339.359
but yeah in a way the picard season one

2336.56 --> 2342.7999999999997
was almost like a very prolonged movie

2339.359 --> 2345.52
because it it felt like a movie that was

2342.8 --> 2348.96
just a little longer

2345.52 --> 2349.839
quite long actually anyway

2348.96 --> 2354.68
uh

2349.839 --> 2354.68
yeah lots of movie reviews today

2359.92 --> 2365.359
it's a prequel for ratatouille what the

2363.04 --> 2365.359
[ __ ]

2365.52 --> 2369.839
that flat fella what are you talking

2367.2 --> 2369.839
about

2371.599 --> 2375.119
hello jedo good to see you

2375.76 --> 2379.2000000000003
ellis g good to see you

2381.359 --> 2387.359
you enjoy the ratatouille so i can

2384.72 --> 2392.2
sure you can dream it just doesn't make

2387.359 --> 2392.2
a hell of a lot of sense but that's fine

2392.54 --> 2395.59
[Music]

2397.92 --> 2400.16
ah

2408.96 --> 2414.319
let me see in the first it stopped

2410.72 --> 2414.319
because of the c oh really

2416.64 --> 2418.8799999999997
hmm

2421.44 --> 2426.16
i didn't know that pj crochet

2423.76 --> 2428.3190000000004
we're talking about picard right

2426.16 --> 2431.1189999999997
so they stopped

2428.319 --> 2433.2799999999997
filming it because of the

2431.119 --> 2436.28
the covet lockdowns and all that that

2433.28 --> 2436.28
sucks

2456.48 --> 2459.48
so

2466.8 --> 2473.119
nathan swears too much can't watch

2469.839 --> 2473.119
no jado

2474.0 --> 2479.68
come on it's not that bad i mean it is

2477.119 --> 2482.56
pretty harsh right but we're dealing

2479.68 --> 2484.96
with lunatics literal lunatics right

2482.56 --> 2487.119
nathan doesn't go off

2484.96 --> 2491.44
on just normies or

2487.119 --> 2491.44
regular ballers like that never

2491.599 --> 2496.96
it's when the anti-flat earthers show

2495.2 --> 2499.2
that they're lunatics and that they're

2496.96 --> 2502.16
trying to

2499.2 --> 2504.72
make their broken mind rub off

2502.16 --> 2506.8799999999997
knowingly on an intuitive level on

2504.72 --> 2508.64
everybody else when they're literally

2506.88 --> 2513.8
trying to indoctrinate others with their

2508.64 --> 2513.7999999999997
insanity that's when nathan goes off

2527.76 --> 2531.0
thank you

2532.56 --> 2535.65

2548.0 --> 2553.04
flat fellow that is just really weird

2553.94 --> 2558.319
[Music]

2555.92 --> 2560.96
your wife made you say that

2558.319 --> 2560.96
it's okay

2561.04 --> 2564.2799999999997
all right

2577.2 --> 2579.839
hmm

2594.07 --> 2597.119
[Applause]

2603.119 --> 2606.7200000000003
right

2604.96 --> 2608.16
so

2606.72 --> 2611.56
what else has been

2608.16 --> 2611.56
going down

2627.76 --> 2631.0400000000004
oh by the way did anybody see their

2629.52 --> 2634.56
really weird move

2631.04 --> 2638.4
video from mr chess week

2634.56 --> 2638.4
i think it was for yesterday morning

2638.8 --> 2644.48
i i think i might have seen this

2641.119 --> 2647.359
somewhere before i really wonder

2644.48 --> 2650.319
like if that is actually a blue beam

2647.359 --> 2650.319
test or if it's

2650.4 --> 2654.96
literally cgi

2652.4 --> 2657.96
i mean the video quality is not that

2654.96 --> 2657.96
great

2664.48 --> 2671.4
i got this feeling it's it's somebody

2667.68 --> 2671.3999999999996
cgi'd it

2682.24 --> 2686.64
and the flat earthers are lying to the

2684.0 --> 2688.96
unsuspecting public

2686.64 --> 2691.839
yeah

2688.96 --> 2691.839
they're trying to

2692.48 --> 2698.56
but unsuspecting public you know

2695.839 --> 2701.44
they're not just gonna take some guy or

2698.56 --> 2702.839
a couple of guys that are we are science

2701.44 --> 2706.4
online they're

2702.839 --> 2708.48
not usually if they're unsuspecting pub

2706.4 --> 2711.28
they're not usually just gonna take what

2708.48 --> 2713.2
they say for some guy randomly on the

2711.28 --> 2714.079
internet for granted

2713.2 --> 2716.56
right

2714.079 --> 2719.119
that's only people that are already kind

2716.56 --> 2722.64
of numpty in nature

2719.119 --> 2724.8
that would that might do that

2722.64 --> 2728.56
but

2724.8 --> 2730.319
i think it that's not the crowd

2728.56 --> 2732.72
for the anti-flutter i think that the

2730.319 --> 2736.24
crowd for the anti-flat earthers is the

2732.72 --> 2738.48
other anti-flat earthers

2736.24 --> 2741.839
to kind of like keep encouraging each

2738.48 --> 2744.2400000000002
other like yeah yeah we're right right

2741.839 --> 2744.24
because

2744.64 --> 2748.72
they're breaking with so many

2749.76 --> 2754.079
yeah with the globe lore they're

2751.119 --> 2756.48
breaking with that so many times that

2754.079 --> 2758.7200000000003
even normies will just pick up on that

2756.48 --> 2762.079
like these guys these guys

2758.72 --> 2763.04
are not sticking to the official story

2762.079 --> 2765.28
so

2763.04 --> 2767.52
are they really reliable are they really

2765.28 --> 2769.2000000000003
crazies

2767.52 --> 2770.64
right

2769.2 --> 2773.2799999999997
i think that

2770.64 --> 2775.2
anti-flat earther popularity is being

2773.28 --> 2777.92
highly overblown

2775.2 --> 2782.0789999999997
like highly overblown

2777.92 --> 2783.52
by them also by the way but also because

2782.079 --> 2786.079
i don't know

2783.52 --> 2787.599
the subscribers they buy or however that

2786.079 --> 2790.5600000000004
works

2787.599 --> 2793.119
or maybe by now there are just kind of a

2790.56 --> 2794.96
lot of anti-flat earthers i don't know i

2793.119 --> 2795.76
don't know how many there really are you

2794.96 --> 2798.4
know

2795.76 --> 2801.44
only the ones that

2798.4 --> 2803.28
do videos and show up in chats and have

2801.44 --> 2805.28
and build their own persistent

2803.28 --> 2807.6800000000003
structural narrative

2805.28 --> 2809.119
i really consider as anti-flat earthers

2807.68 --> 2812.0
right

2809.119 --> 2813.599
because if they're just somebody in chat

2812.0 --> 2815.68
you don't know

2813.599 --> 2817.44
you don't know that you don't know what

2815.68 --> 2819.839
they really are they're barely

2817.44 --> 2822.16
representing

2819.839 --> 2824.56
they might just be in transit they might

2822.16 --> 2826.72
be on the move and just happen to hang

2824.56 --> 2828.64
around there for a while

2826.72 --> 2831.52
to get the bearing as to what's going on

2828.64 --> 2834.319
you don't know right it's only

2831.52 --> 2835.599
anti-flat earthers that actually

2834.319 --> 2838.24
get

2835.599 --> 2840.7200000000003
on discord at flat earth debate and that

2838.24 --> 2843.359
have their own channels and make videos

2840.72 --> 2844.3999999999996
and video responses and all that those

2843.359 --> 2847.2
are

2844.4 --> 2849.119
the real anti-flat earthers

2847.2 --> 2852.9199999999996
that are unmistakable

2849.119 --> 2852.92
because of their actions

2864.72 --> 2870.9199999999996
yeah the truth defends itself the lies

2866.72 --> 2870.9199999999996
need a whole team that's right

2873.599 --> 2876.8
hey aries 106.

2876.96 --> 2881.52
i think most people don't care about

2878.8 --> 2883.3590000000004
flat earth one way or another yeah

2881.52 --> 2885.2
that's right

2883.359 --> 2888.4
well

2885.2 --> 2890.5589999999997
care they'll pick up on it they'll hear

2888.4 --> 2893.44
some things they might even like make a

2890.559 --> 2896.48
decision about it but they won't care to

2893.44 --> 2898.559
like delve too deeply into it

2896.48 --> 2902.0
so they'd be like okay

2898.559 --> 2903.3590000000004
right so it's not a ball apparently

2902.0 --> 2905.28
and then they'll be like yeah i don't

2903.359 --> 2907.52
really want to know more like okay i

2905.28 --> 2910.4
just know that what we're seeing is

2907.52 --> 2913.599
incorrect but yeah the flutters don't

2910.4 --> 2915.839
really when you put push comes to shove

2913.599 --> 2918.1600000000003
they don't really know what it is either

2915.839 --> 2919.68
except flat

2918.16 --> 2922.5589999999997
right

2919.68 --> 2924.319
and yeah not everybody is all like oh i

2922.559 --> 2926.48
want to figure it out i want to know

2924.319 --> 2929.8
what this reality is not everybody has

2926.48 --> 2929.8
those impulses

2933.359 --> 2938.72
right but a lot more people do kind of

2936.319 --> 2941.599
accept that flat earth is out there and

2938.72 --> 2944.5589999999997
that it is an option like that it isn't

2941.599 --> 2948.1600000000003
just like oh the crazy old flat earth no

2944.559 --> 2950.1600000000003
no that spell oh the crazy flat earth is

2948.16 --> 2952.8799999999997
still living in the middle ages that's

2950.16 --> 2955.04
completely worn out

2952.88 --> 2957.28
that spell is

2955.04 --> 2958.5589999999997
running out of juice it's not gonna come

2957.28 --> 2960.48
back

2958.559 --> 2962.3190000000004
that worked really well in the 20th

2960.48 --> 2964.8
century by the way

2962.319 --> 2965.7599999999998
doesn't work anymore

2964.8 --> 2968.2400000000002
right

2965.76 --> 2971.2000000000003
it really doesn't every time now

2968.24 --> 2972.9599999999996
some somebody somewhere in the news or

2971.2 --> 2974.5589999999997
some television program or something

2972.96 --> 2977.04
says that

2974.559 --> 2978.6400000000003
it's just everybody's like

2977.04 --> 2980.96
yeah

2978.64 --> 2980.96
sure

2981.119 --> 2984.119
no

2988.559 --> 2992.2400000000002
fe needs more proof

2993.04 --> 2996.5589999999997
okay then

2996.64 --> 2999.839
i was seeking star wars

3000.559 --> 3003.119
by the way

3008.96 --> 3014.559
the anti-flat earthers are the people in

3011.2 --> 3014.5589999999997
congress setting policy

3016.559 --> 3021.3190000000004
i

3018.079 --> 3021.319
you think

3039.599 --> 3044.1600000000003
globe needs some science

3042.559 --> 3046.8
no

3044.16 --> 3048.96
no it doesn't

3046.8 --> 3051.599
the whole thing about globe is they need

3048.96 --> 3054.88
to let go of science

3051.599 --> 3056.96
because they got it wrong like they got

3054.88 --> 3058.0
what science is wrong and then the

3056.96 --> 3059.04
endless

3058.0 --> 3062.16
no

3059.04 --> 3065.04
but in school and our teachers and

3062.16 --> 3068.7999999999997
everybody we learned all this [ __ ] with

3065.04 --> 3071.7599999999998
says science is more than just a method

3068.8 --> 3075.04
yeah i know you've all been initiated in

3071.76 --> 3075.0400000000004
that ridiculous

3075.44 --> 3079.359
delusional process of thinking that

3077.599 --> 3080.7200000000003
science can be whatever the [ __ ] you

3079.359 --> 3083.5989999999997
want it to be

3080.72 --> 3085.5989999999997
yeah that was always wrong and yeah you

3083.599 --> 3088.1600000000003
might have spent like 20 years of your

3085.599 --> 3091.2000000000003
life dealing with people that were all

3088.16 --> 3094.8799999999997
reinforcing the idea that it's okay

3091.2 --> 3097.2799999999997
to do that they were all wrong all of

3094.88 --> 3100.319
them yeah and that means potentially

3097.28 --> 3104.7200000000003
millions and millions of people in the

3100.319 --> 3105.7599999999998
world teachers and all got it wrong all

3104.72 --> 3108.24
of them

3105.76 --> 3111.599
all of them got it wrong that's right

3108.24 --> 3115.5989999999997
yeah deal with it yeah people can be

3111.599 --> 3118.6400000000003
wrong a lot of them for a very long time

3115.599 --> 3121.839
right because if you just keep repeating

3118.64 --> 3124.24
a lie enough then eventually people will

3121.839 --> 3126.16
start to think it's true because why

3124.24 --> 3129.2
would it be repeated all the time

3126.16 --> 3131.7599999999998
otherwise right why would they repeat a

3129.2 --> 3134.0
lie so many times unless it actually was

3131.76 --> 3136.3190000000004
the truth that's the tendency that's the

3134.0 --> 3136.319
trick

3136.48 --> 3139.839
that's where you're at

3148.319 --> 3152.48
globe theory was a bad guess

3150.64 --> 3156.7999999999997
no it wasn't

3152.48 --> 3156.8
no it wasn't it was always on purpose

3158.72 --> 3162.0789999999997
the people

3159.92 --> 3164.88
who introduced the idea that the earth

3162.079 --> 3166.7200000000003
might be a globe were always in the know

3164.88 --> 3168.96
it wasn't

3166.72 --> 3172.7999999999997
the globe

3168.96 --> 3172.8
is an anti-flatter theory

3175.44 --> 3178.16
it always was

3177.04 --> 3181.7599999999998
always

3178.16 --> 3184.48
they always knew it was a lie

3181.76 --> 3188.1600000000003
that's why literally these people in the

3184.48 --> 3191.599
early times were were declared wizards

3188.16 --> 3192.7999999999997
and sorcerers trickers because everybody

3191.599 --> 3195.599
knew

3192.8 --> 3197.28
that they knew they were lying and

3195.599 --> 3198.559
trying to fool everybody into believing

3197.28 --> 3200.7200000000003
it was a globe

3198.559 --> 3203.3590000000004
back then it was very much clear in

3200.72 --> 3206.24
everybody's mind that these people are

3203.359 --> 3208.64
trying to bend reality

3206.24 --> 3211.2799999999997
they knew instinctively everybody would

3208.64 --> 3214.48
know like these guys are creeps and

3211.28 --> 3216.48
wizards and they're trying to trick us

3214.48 --> 3219.44
everybody knew

3216.48 --> 3222.72
nobody was falling for it they were not

3219.44 --> 3225.599
universally respected

3222.72 --> 3226.7999999999997
by the common folk they were not

3225.599 --> 3229.2000000000003
they were

3226.8 --> 3232.0
loathed a lot of the time

3229.2 --> 3233.359
and then protected by courts and [ __ ]

3232.0 --> 3235.68
rich people

3233.359 --> 3238.5589999999997
nobody wanted them though everybody

3235.68 --> 3241.2799999999997
hated them because everybody knew

3238.559 --> 3242.7200000000003
they were liars by the very words that

3241.28 --> 3246.2000000000003
came out in their mouth when they would

3242.72 --> 3246.2
speak in public

3253.44 --> 3257.2000000000003
globe theory was a hijacking of the

3255.28 --> 3259.3590000000004
eyeball

3257.2 --> 3262.72
globe theory was a hijacking of a whole

3259.359 --> 3265.5989999999997
lot of things eyeball is one of them but

3262.72 --> 3267.5989999999997
also the apparent globe of the heavens

3265.599 --> 3270.1600000000003
the celestial sphere

3267.599 --> 3272.4
which was it's always been an apparent

3270.16 --> 3273.2
celestial sphere there's been maps of

3272.4 --> 3276.079
that

3273.2 --> 3280.5589999999997
literal maps like in a sphere it's a

3276.079 --> 3282.2400000000002
sphere they show the map of the stars

3280.559 --> 3284.88
and that's what they used i think that

3282.24 --> 3286.0
that is the primary foundation

3284.88 --> 3288.0
earth

3286.0 --> 3289.839
it's basically a

3288.0 --> 3293.04
formal logical fallacy

3289.839 --> 3294.319
earth has to be a sphere because we are

3293.04 --> 3297.68
surrounded

3294.319 --> 3300.5589999999997
by a sphere of stars

3297.68 --> 3302.5989999999997
right and that would even work that that

3300.559 --> 3304.1600000000003
angle of approach even works in

3302.599 --> 3306.799
geocentrism

3304.16 --> 3308.8799999999997
because geocentrism can

3306.799 --> 3311.92
also have ball

3308.88 --> 3314.559
in it the earth being a ball but that is

3311.92 --> 3317.2000000000003
what it was that's how they did it

3314.559 --> 3318.96
earth has to be a ball because it is

3317.2 --> 3321.68
surrounded

3318.96 --> 3324.0
by a celestial sphere

3321.68 --> 3326.24
that's the train of thinking

3324.0 --> 3328.72
it isn't though right the the celestial

3326.24 --> 3331.04
sphere is not actually literal lights in

3328.72 --> 3331.9199999999996
literal positions literally surrounding

3331.04 --> 3333.839
us

3331.92 --> 3335.28
it's only apparent it's a holographic

3333.839 --> 3337.119
effect

3335.28 --> 3340.3190000000004
none of those lights are in literal

3337.119 --> 3342.48
positions including the sun

3340.319 --> 3345.92
the light manifests

3342.48 --> 3349.599
from an apparent angular position

3345.92 --> 3351.44
but not coming from any literal location

3349.599 --> 3352.7200000000003
in euclidean space

3351.44 --> 3354.2400000000002
but yeah that's

3352.72 --> 3356.0789999999997
kind of a big

3354.24 --> 3357.839
complication

3356.079 --> 3360.079
that back then

3357.839 --> 3361.68
i don't even know if if people that

3360.079 --> 3362.799
thought about those types of things and

3361.68 --> 3364.799
issues

3362.799 --> 3367.28
they'd come up with it in the first

3364.799 --> 3370.88
place and then if they would be able to

3367.28 --> 3374.0
explain it to anybody right i'm having

3370.88 --> 3374.96
trouble explaining it to people

3374.0 --> 3377.839
and i'm

3374.96 --> 3379.359
21st century pretty much

3377.839 --> 3382.4
right

3379.359 --> 3384.72
and specializing in explaining it's very

3382.4 --> 3386.4
complicated even now

3384.72 --> 3387.839
with my

3386.4 --> 3391.52
dynamic

3387.839 --> 3394.96
range of language and my lifetime

3391.52 --> 3399.359
dedication to comprehension in itself

3394.96 --> 3399.359
to explain it to the majority of people

3400.4 --> 3404.319
that the celestials are holographic

3402.48 --> 3406.72
that's just really complicated to

3404.319 --> 3407.839
explain every single time

3406.72 --> 3410.24
it

3407.839 --> 3413.839
might stay like that for a while i'm not

3410.24 --> 3415.7599999999998
expecting that in 20 years everybody

3413.839 --> 3418.16
will understand it no

3415.76 --> 3420.4
no i'm not expecting that at all i hope

3418.16 --> 3424.0
some will i really hope i'm not going to

3420.4 --> 3426.1600000000003
be like the only guy ever

3424.0 --> 3428.16
although yeah probably not like that but

3426.16 --> 3431.52
you know what i mean

3428.16 --> 3434.24
right but say 500 years ago or

3431.52 --> 3435.92
for whatever it was

3434.24 --> 3438.16
even if they realized that the

3435.92 --> 3440.319
celestials were holographic

3438.16 --> 3441.839
they wouldn't even know how to explain

3440.319 --> 3444.5589999999997
that to people

3441.839 --> 3447.2
it would probably drift off in like oh

3444.559 --> 3450.0
they're angels they're not they're in

3447.2 --> 3451.9199999999996
heaven they're not really here

3450.0 --> 3453.28
you know it would probably go in that

3451.92 --> 3454.4
direction

3453.28 --> 3457.119
just to

3454.4 --> 3458.88
still be able to attain the attention of

3457.119 --> 3459.6800000000003
the public they're talking to

3458.88 --> 3462.559
right

3459.68 --> 3465.04
but it's much easier to just say

3462.559 --> 3467.44
we're surrounded by a sphere here's the

3465.04 --> 3469.2
map of the celestial sphere

3467.44 --> 3471.2000000000003
we're surrounded by a sphere right it's

3469.2 --> 3475.1189999999997
around you you see it at night it's

3471.2 --> 3476.96
right there so if it surrounds us then

3475.119 --> 3479.6800000000003
well

3476.96 --> 3482.0
how could you think the earth wasn't a

3479.68 --> 3484.48
sphere underneath that all and that's

3482.0 --> 3486.88
then how that started that's much easier

3484.48 --> 3489.92
to click in people's minds because it's

3486.88 --> 3492.799
all about shapes and right you expect

3489.92 --> 3495.04
shapes to be as they are

3492.799 --> 3498.0
and if you say look the celestial lights

3495.04 --> 3501.44
are a sphere see here's the map it turns

3498.0 --> 3503.92
around us you can witness this yourself

3501.44 --> 3505.04
then yeah physicality assumption bias

3503.92 --> 3506.7200000000003
sets in

3505.04 --> 3507.92
and people will think well if it's a

3506.72 --> 3510.0789999999997
sphere

3507.92 --> 3512.0
then yeah then it makes no sense if it

3510.079 --> 3514.0
was flat underneath it would have to be

3512.0 --> 3516.079
a sphere underneath

3514.0 --> 3518.72
so the earth must be a sphere somehow

3516.079 --> 3520.7200000000003
otherwise i don't understand how

3518.72 --> 3523.4399999999996
it could be in

3520.72 --> 3525.52
that celestial sphere right physicality

3523.44 --> 3528.16
assumption bias because

3525.52 --> 3529.68
they wouldn't realize it's holographic

3528.16 --> 3532.0
they'd think no they're still like

3529.68 --> 3535.5989999999997
little candle lights

3532.0 --> 3535.599
somewhere at a set distance

3541.28 --> 3544.28
anyway

3545.52 --> 3549.92
you will never see the southern cross

3547.76 --> 3552.48
from europe yeah

3549.92 --> 3552.48
so what

3553.04 --> 3558.079
you know you will never see

3555.119 --> 3560.559
an angular size increase

3558.079 --> 3563.2000000000003
of any of the celestial lights including

3560.559 --> 3566.079
the moon which in heliocentrism is

3563.2 --> 3566.96
supposed to be very close by yeah you'll

3566.079 --> 3568.559
never

3566.96 --> 3571.2
see

3568.559 --> 3575.119
somebody or something approaching the

3571.2 --> 3577.04
moon and having the angular size

3575.119 --> 3580.319
growing oh look we're getting closer to

3577.04 --> 3583.119
the moon we're getting close no

3580.319 --> 3584.64
you're not going to see that

3583.119 --> 3588.48
because it's

3584.64 --> 3588.48
celestial lights they're holographic

3588.64 --> 3596.5989999999997
they don't reveal angular size increase

3592.72 --> 3596.5989999999997
or change at all

3610.16 --> 3615.5989999999997
because of distance no not distance

3613.68 --> 3618.48
no

3615.599 --> 3620.88
has [ __ ] all to do with distance

3618.48 --> 3623.04
it's just not there

3620.88 --> 3625.44
it's not manifesting because you are in

3623.04 --> 3627.52
the wrong place

3625.44 --> 3630.559
there's a very persistent

3627.52 --> 3633.119
angular manifestation of the celestial

3630.559 --> 3636.0
sphere in relation to the observer and

3633.119 --> 3637.6800000000003
their position on the earth

3636.0 --> 3640.24
it just tilts

3637.68 --> 3643.7599999999998
virtually because the entire celestial

3640.24 --> 3646.24
light landscape is all virtual

3643.76 --> 3648.7200000000003
none of it is in literal positions none

3646.24 --> 3651.2
of it it's only angular in relation to

3648.72 --> 3653.2799999999997
the observer based on their position on

3651.2 --> 3657.0789999999997
the earth

3653.28 --> 3657.079
oh [ __ ] off

3669.839 --> 3674.799
there's a planet blocking the view what

3672.24 --> 3674.799
the [ __ ]

3683.68 --> 3687.68
that doesn't make any sense with what i

3685.839 --> 3691.48
was talking about so

3687.68 --> 3691.48
hello service day

3707.839 --> 3712.88
i can't no it has nothing to do with

3710.88 --> 3714.88
distance backs

3712.88 --> 3717.2000000000003
nothing

3714.88 --> 3719.44
it's not you can't see it

3717.2 --> 3721.4399999999996
because of distance it's because it's

3719.44 --> 3724.48
not manifesting

3721.44 --> 3725.52
to you as an observer because of your

3724.48 --> 3727.359
position

3725.52 --> 3729.52
has nothing to do with distance because

3727.359 --> 3732.72
there is no distance

3729.52 --> 3735.52
to you and the southern cross

3732.72 --> 3738.0789999999997
there is no distance right there is no

3735.52 --> 3740.64
distance to the sun there is no distance

3738.079 --> 3742.7200000000003
to the planets there's no distance to

3740.64 --> 3747.0389999999998
the stars there's no distance to the

3742.72 --> 3749.839
moon there is no distance to say

3747.039 --> 3752.1600000000003
i'm too far away is wrong because there

3749.839 --> 3754.799
is no distance do you understand there

3752.16 --> 3757.68
is no distance to any of it it's not out

3754.799 --> 3759.599
of sight because of a distance it's out

3757.68 --> 3762.96
of sight because you're not in the

3759.599 --> 3765.92
correct position for it to angularly

3762.96 --> 3769.839
manifest to you as an observer

3765.92 --> 3769.839
has nothing to do with distance

3776.72 --> 3780.16
yeah well the big m there's a lot of

3778.4 --> 3782.48
retards out there that say a lot of

3780.16 --> 3784.48
stupid things what the [ __ ] would i even

3782.48 --> 3786.559
be doing in england i've never been

3784.48 --> 3789.839
there i don't want to go there why the

3786.559 --> 3789.8390000000004
how would i get there

3790.64 --> 3793.68
it makes no sense

3795.44 --> 3799.76
right that that's just like oh

3797.52 --> 3802.4
buckingham yeah oh well that's just like

3799.76 --> 3805.2000000000003
saying oh orwen went to

3802.4 --> 3807.6800000000003
antarctica and then he got trapped in a

3805.2 --> 3809.359
snow pit and now he's frozen or

3807.68 --> 3811.839
something stupid like that would you

3809.359 --> 3815.88
believe that the big m

3811.839 --> 3815.88
that's just about as [ __ ]

3829.52 --> 3832.4
take the tunnel no

3831.44 --> 3836.599
no

3832.4 --> 3836.599
why the hell would i go there

3840.559 --> 3842.88
right

3846.0 --> 3849.28
so backs yeah i think you got the

3848.24 --> 3851.68
message

3849.28 --> 3853.44
it is comple it's a complication right

3851.68 --> 3856.0
every time you say

3853.44 --> 3858.799
i can't see it because of distance you

3856.0 --> 3862.72
immediately imply

3858.799 --> 3864.559
that it has a distance to you

3862.72 --> 3867.0389999999998
it doesn't

3864.559 --> 3870.48
there is no distance to you and the

3867.039 --> 3872.079
celestial lights there's only

3870.48 --> 3875.839
grid

3872.079 --> 3878.96
after which if you go outside of that

3875.839 --> 3880.64
then it will not manifest to you angular

3878.96 --> 3883.599
wise because

3880.64 --> 3886.4
the angle of the celestial sphere may

3883.599 --> 3890.1600000000003
change as you change the position

3886.4 --> 3893.28
but that's not because of a literal

3890.16 --> 3895.2799999999997
distance between you and the celestial

3893.28 --> 3897.76
light

3895.28 --> 3900.559
it's only because there is a direct

3897.76 --> 3903.6800000000003
angular relation between how the

3900.559 --> 3907.2000000000003
celestial demisphere manifests to you as

3903.68 --> 3910.0
an observer and where you are on earth

3907.2 --> 3912.0789999999997
not because of actual distances between

3910.0 --> 3914.96
you and the lights

3912.079 --> 3916.1600000000003
the only actual distances are on the

3914.96 --> 3918.16
earth

3916.16 --> 3920.48
your position

3918.16 --> 3923.52
may have a distance to in relation to

3920.48 --> 3926.72
another position none of those positions

3923.52 --> 3928.88
have any distance relationship towards a

3926.72 --> 3931.0389999999998
celestial light though

3928.88 --> 3932.7200000000003
that's really important

3931.039 --> 3934.7200000000003
to keep that apart

3932.72 --> 3937.2799999999997
in your mind

3934.72 --> 3940.16
because physicality assumption bias will

3937.28 --> 3942.4
pull you back into assuming again it has

3940.16 --> 3944.5589999999997
a literal distance it doesn't there is

3942.4 --> 3947.359
no distance to the sun there is no

3944.559 --> 3949.039
evidence for this

3947.359 --> 3951.2799999999997
there's no distance to the moon there's

3949.039 --> 3954.6400000000003
no evidence for this either and these

3951.28 --> 3956.48
are supposedly be in heliocentrism

3954.64 --> 3960.48
closer by lights

3956.48 --> 3961.52
there's no evidence for any distance

3960.48 --> 3962.319
so

3961.52 --> 3966.079
and

3962.319 --> 3967.92
disconnect it in your mind no distance

3966.079 --> 3970.48
there is no distance it's only an

3967.92 --> 3972.64
angular relation between you as an

3970.48 --> 3976.599
observer

3972.64 --> 3976.5989999999997
and the celestial light

3989.039 --> 3994.7990000000004
did you get dad's skype

3992.48 --> 3994.799
what

3995.119 --> 3999.039
uh

3996.079 --> 4000.799
i have no idea

3999.039 --> 4003.119
ed smack

4000.799 --> 4006.119
i've had some people contacting me on

4003.119 --> 4006.119
skype

4006.559 --> 4011.119
i don't know if your dad did or anything

4014.64 --> 4019.5989999999997
does a distance exist between me and the

4016.96 --> 4021.68
closest edge of the dome

4019.599 --> 4026.319
i don't know if there is any

4021.68 --> 4026.319
barrier touching down ares 106.

4029.119 --> 4033.839
there is

4030.4 --> 4037.119
at minimum has to be it absolutely must

4033.839 --> 4040.5589999999997
be under every conceivable circumstances

4037.119 --> 4041.52
there must be a flat top

4040.559 --> 4044.4
that's

4041.52 --> 4046.079
absolutely certain but

4044.4 --> 4048.96
there could be touchdown points there

4046.079 --> 4051.76
could be a dome there could be a

4048.96 --> 4055.28
demi tube covering for example in a

4051.76 --> 4058.6400000000003
looping setup it could be

4055.28 --> 4061.3590000000004
but what absolutely at minimum must be

4058.64 --> 4063.2799999999997
is a flat covering

4061.359 --> 4067.44
top

4063.28 --> 4069.28
a cutoff a limiter to the volume of the

4067.44 --> 4071.039
containment of our system

4069.28 --> 4073.52
that must be

4071.039 --> 4076.48
now whether it is purely flat

4073.52 --> 4079.599
the top that covers us or whether it is

4076.48 --> 4083.039
some kind of a dome-like structure

4079.599 --> 4083.039
we don't know i don't know

4083.2 --> 4089.4399999999996
but there must be a covering at minimum

4087.039 --> 4091.599
there is no guarantee of any touchdown

4089.44 --> 4094.7200000000003
point any

4091.599 --> 4098.56
there might be pillars

4094.72 --> 4101.04
like weird pillars that upholds like un

4098.56 --> 4102.4800000000005
indestructible pillars

4101.04 --> 4105.12
that uphold

4102.48 --> 4108.159
this flat top for example

4105.12 --> 4110.3189999999995
at some point way outside of our

4108.159 --> 4112.0
realm knowledge might be that it's like

4110.319 --> 4114.159000000001
a pillar that's

4112.0 --> 4116.239
just completely off the map

4114.159 --> 4117.44
you could never get close enough to even

4116.239 --> 4119.199
see it

4117.44 --> 4123.5199999999995
because the way the maps are designed

4119.199 --> 4125.839
could be potential option i don't know

4123.52 --> 4127.839000000001
that could be literally a dome

4125.839 --> 4128.88
at some point like in the antarctic and

4127.839 --> 4130.96
you just

4128.88 --> 4132.56
boom boom boom

4130.96 --> 4134.56
who knows

4132.56 --> 4136.4800000000005
who knows

4134.56 --> 4138.96
i don't know

4136.48 --> 4143.5599999999995
i don't know what the shape is of the

4138.96 --> 4143.56
containment that we are in

4147.12 --> 4150.12
hmm

4174.56 --> 4176.88
all right

4180.4 --> 4188.3589999999995
don't presuppose gas pressure based on

4183.679 --> 4188.359
the weight no yeah but that's ridiculous

4189.12 --> 4192.159
gas

4190.48 --> 4193.04
does not have

4192.159 --> 4194.96
weight

4193.04 --> 4197.6
in that sense

4194.96 --> 4199.44
right you can compress the gas

4197.6 --> 4201.4400000000005
and then you can weigh it because it's

4199.44 --> 4205.04
no longer a gas

4201.44 --> 4207.36
and it no longer has a zero offset

4205.04 --> 4210.64
with the relative density of

4207.36 --> 4213.28
the atmosphere or gas

4210.64 --> 4216.64
pressure that surrounds us which is what

4213.28 --> 4219.679
weight as a convention is based on

4216.64 --> 4222.719
so relative density this equilibrium

4219.679 --> 4226.4800000000005
offset translated into pressure based on

4222.719 --> 4228.88
a medium of air at ground level

4226.48 --> 4231.28
so you can't weigh gas because it's

4228.88 --> 4232.8
still relative density based and there's

4231.28 --> 4235.5199999999995
no offset

4232.8 --> 4237.679
because gases go in all directions they

4235.52 --> 4240.400000000001
they don't exert

4237.679 --> 4242.88
a consistent pressure

4240.4 --> 4245.04
when surrounded by a medium of gas

4242.88 --> 4246.88
that's the whole point

4245.04 --> 4250.159
you can't weigh a gas

4246.88 --> 4251.6
you can only condense it force it into

4250.159 --> 4253.199
another state

4251.6 --> 4254.719
so that it will

4253.199 --> 4255.44
have an offset

4254.719 --> 4258.56
with

4255.44 --> 4260.879999999999
the medium of gas in order for it to

4258.56 --> 4262.080000000001
exert a consistent

4260.88 --> 4264.56
downward

4262.08 --> 4267.36
pressure because of the relative density

4264.56 --> 4269.77
this equilibrium

4267.36 --> 4272.808999999999
if you heard of gravity

4269.77 --> 4272.809
[Music]

4273.36 --> 4278.32
have you heard of yeah i've heard of

4275.36 --> 4282.239
gravity it's [ __ ] there's no

4278.32 --> 4282.239
gravity doesn't exist it's a concept

4282.56 --> 4287.360000000001
and

4283.28 --> 4290.159
i am not here for you to just spam that

4287.36 --> 4292.96
[ __ ] over and over and over again for

4290.159 --> 4295.5199999999995
[ __ ] six years

4292.96 --> 4298.32
when i've like already went through that

4295.52 --> 4300.96
so many times i no

4298.32 --> 4302.799999999999
gravity doesn't exist there's only

4300.96 --> 4305.04
relative density

4302.8 --> 4307.360000000001
relative density is

4305.04 --> 4311.28
scientific fact

4307.36 --> 4315.679
repeatable easy easily repeatable

4311.28 --> 4316.96
scientific fact that's absolute app so

4315.679 --> 4320.8
loot

4316.96 --> 4323.6
no exception no exception zero exception

4320.8 --> 4326.2390000000005
every scenario including movement

4323.6 --> 4328.56
everything everything that happens is

4326.239 --> 4331.04
compatible with relative density because

4328.56 --> 4333.280000000001
it is scientific fact

4331.04 --> 4337.199
always works like that always no

4333.28 --> 4340.08
exception no exemption free fall no

4337.199 --> 4342.4
exemption it's all explainable through

4340.08 --> 4343.44
relative density every part of it is

4342.4 --> 4347.44
every

4343.44 --> 4349.44
single conceivable setup is explainable

4347.44 --> 4352.32
through a relative density

4349.44 --> 4354.239
gravity however is a is a disclaimed

4352.32 --> 4355.679
hypothesis

4354.239 --> 4358.799999999999
from newton he never claimed the

4355.679 --> 4361.52
hypothesis for it even being a thing he

4358.8 --> 4362.2390000000005
was outraged at the notion

4361.52 --> 4365.120000000001
that

4362.239 --> 4368.639999999999
he would be pinned down on the theory of

4365.12 --> 4371.04
gravitation he claimed no such theory

4368.64 --> 4373.52
no theory it's not a theory gravity is

4371.04 --> 4376.159
not a theory

4373.52 --> 4379.040000000001
because there is no claim

4376.159 --> 4381.199
that is scientific about it there is no

4379.04 --> 4384.08
scientific claim

4381.199 --> 4386.4
for gravity it's not a theory it's just

4384.08 --> 4389.36
a concept a concept that's been

4386.4 --> 4390.5599999999995
disproven not a theory a theory is

4389.36 --> 4392.48
proven

4390.56 --> 4394.4800000000005
it's a theory

4392.48 --> 4398.879999999999
when it actually works

4394.48 --> 4400.718999999999
if it doesn't work it's just a concept

4398.88 --> 4403.28
it's just a concept gravity is just a

4400.719 --> 4405.92
concept it it's not even newtonian

4403.28 --> 4408.96
gravity anymore it's einsteining gravity

4405.92 --> 4411.1990000000005
which doesn't even take place

4408.96 --> 4414.08
in physical reality

4411.199 --> 4417.678999999999
by admission

4414.08 --> 4420.0
it's ridiculous gravity is not a thing

4417.679 --> 4422.2390000000005
it's a concept it doesn't exist it

4420.0 --> 4424.159
doesn't apply to anything

4422.239 --> 4427.678999999999
anything everything

4424.159 --> 4428.639999999999
however can be explained

4427.679 --> 4430.2390000000005
that's

4428.64 --> 4432.719
before

4430.239 --> 4434.879999999999
attributed to gravity everything

4432.719 --> 4438.08
that's been attributed to gravity in

4434.88 --> 4441.04
practical reality is very easily and

4438.08 --> 4444.4
perfectly explainable through relative

4441.04 --> 4446.96
density every conceivable setup doesn't

4444.4 --> 4449.599999999999
matter how complicated you make it does

4446.96 --> 4451.92
not matter what is happening

4449.6 --> 4456.2390000000005
everything is explainable through

4451.92 --> 4458.4800000000005
relative density every conceivable setup

4456.239 --> 4460.5599999999995
every conceivable setup doesn't matter

4458.48 --> 4463.5199999999995
how challenging you make it

4460.56 --> 4466.2390000000005
everything can be perfectly explained

4463.52 --> 4469.52
through relative density

4466.239 --> 4472.0
gravity is a concept nobody even claimed

4469.52 --> 4474.88
the hypothesis for it and einsteinian

4472.0 --> 4478.84
gravity isn't even claimed to take place

4474.88 --> 4478.84
in physical reality

4487.52 --> 4492.159000000001
that's absolutely [ __ ] noah fiddler

4490.96 --> 4493.92
that's

4492.159 --> 4497.5199999999995
really stupid

4493.92 --> 4498.719
is not verified anything about gravity

4497.52 --> 4501.040000000001
anything

4498.719 --> 4503.44
it's pseudo-ammonia enforcement there

4501.04 --> 4506.239
isn't even a clue

4503.44 --> 4510.48
as to how it ties in with physical

4506.239 --> 4512.959999999999
reality how can you vary and manipulate

4510.48 --> 4516.0
a conceptual medium

4512.96 --> 4517.56
in order to prove a physical real thing

4516.0 --> 4520.96
that's not even

4517.56 --> 4523.6
conceptually possible you freak

4520.96 --> 4526.8
it's not even conceptually possible to

4523.6 --> 4529.120000000001
do that it makes no [ __ ] sense to say

4526.8 --> 4529.12
that

4530.64 --> 4534.64
experience yeah experiments it's not an

4533.28 --> 4537.5199999999995
experiment

4534.64 --> 4540.08
just [ __ ] around and saying this is

4537.52 --> 4542.8
proving something doesn't actually

4540.08 --> 4545.36
scientifically prove anything it's just

4542.8 --> 4548.64
called [ __ ] around

4545.36 --> 4550.4
it's not an experiment

4548.64 --> 4552.4800000000005
it's not even a test

4550.4 --> 4554.48
what's being tested how is it actually

4552.48 --> 4555.919999999999
proving anything using the scientific

4554.48 --> 4559.599999999999
method

4555.92 --> 4561.679
it isn't i know it isn't because if

4559.6 --> 4565.4400000000005
that would have existed i would have

4561.679 --> 4567.52
bumped into that very very much so

4565.44 --> 4569.599999999999
and i haven't because it doesn't exist

4567.52 --> 4571.679
you probably literally made that up you

4569.6 --> 4573.1990000000005
just pulled it out of your ass said oh

4571.679 --> 4576.0
but he did all these

4573.199 --> 4579.759999999999
experiments to prove feinstein in

4576.0 --> 4581.36
pseudo-ammonia force-based gravity yeah

4579.76 --> 4583.52
it's not hypothesis-based

4581.36 --> 4586.719
experimentation though because you can't

4583.52 --> 4590.320000000001
very manipulate things that don't take

4586.719 --> 4594.04
place in physical reality

4590.32 --> 4594.04
it's all math

4603.12 --> 4606.12
okay

4616.0 --> 4620.64
laws of motion yeah newton's laws are

4618.32 --> 4623.12
crap they don't work they've been

4620.64 --> 4626.1990000000005
officially been disproven

4623.12 --> 4627.84
yeah newton's laws of motion have been

4626.199 --> 4631.28
officially

4627.84 --> 4634.08
through university papers

4631.28 --> 4636.4
officially been registered as disproven

4634.08 --> 4638.96
and debunked yes that's correct

4636.4 --> 4640.639999999999
they are officially debunked don't know

4638.96 --> 4642.64
if you know about that

4640.64 --> 4644.2390000000005
maybe you're still holding on to your

4642.64 --> 4646.56
60s

4644.239 --> 4649.28
physics book or something

4646.56 --> 4653.360000000001
from school something dumb like that but

4649.28 --> 4656.0
yeah it's absolutely wrong

4653.36 --> 4657.92
newton's laws of motion are not

4656.0 --> 4659.44
scientifically proven they have been

4657.92 --> 4662.4
disproven

4659.44 --> 4666.96
all of newton's mechanics

4662.4 --> 4668.96
they don't even include gas behavior

4666.96 --> 4672.719
do you even realize that

4668.96 --> 4674.2390000000005
gas behavior is not included in newton's

4672.719 --> 4677.36
physical model

4674.239 --> 4679.5199999999995
of motion it's not included gas is not

4677.36 --> 4682.4
included do you hear me it's not

4679.52 --> 4684.159000000001
included how can you say something is

4682.4 --> 4687.599999999999
proven incorrect

4684.159 --> 4690.159
when it completely excludes an entire

4687.6 --> 4690.84
state of matter

4690.159 --> 4692.719
it's

4690.84 --> 4695.04
ridiculous

4692.719 --> 4697.52
it doesn't include gas behavior how can

4695.04 --> 4700.32
you say it's a proven model when it

4697.52 --> 4701.1990000000005
completely excludes an entire state of

4700.32 --> 4703.04
matter

4701.199 --> 4705.199
it's ridiculous

4703.04 --> 4707.5199999999995
are you even listening to what is

4705.199 --> 4709.5199999999995
rolling out in your

4707.52 --> 4711.120000000001
in the text are you even seeing what

4709.52 --> 4714.719
you're reading it what you're writing

4711.12 --> 4714.719
here this is ridiculous

4719.679 --> 4725.28
citation required for oh well hey hey

4722.239 --> 4726.08
noah fiddling no no no no no no

4725.28 --> 4727.759999999999
yeah

4726.08 --> 4728.64
they didn't say that

4727.76 --> 4730.96
yeah

4728.64 --> 4732.56
oh oh they excluded something and they

4730.96 --> 4735.6
didn't say

4732.56 --> 4738.159000000001
we excluded this oh surprise surprise

4735.6 --> 4739.679
well why don't you

4738.159 --> 4741.679
go

4739.679 --> 4744.08
bring some references

4741.679 --> 4747.1990000000005
as to how it did

4744.08 --> 4748.64
include gas behavior huh

4747.199 --> 4751.839999999999
why didn't you

4748.64 --> 4753.360000000001
show me gas go down go boom boom

4751.84 --> 4754.56
why don't you show me

4753.36 --> 4756.48
gravity

4754.56 --> 4758.400000000001
applying to gas

4756.48 --> 4760.718999999999
falling down go boom boom like

4758.4 --> 4762.96
everything should in that model because

4760.719 --> 4765.28
it excludes gas behavior

4762.96 --> 4765.28
yeah

4765.36 --> 4770.239
why don't you show me that

4767.679 --> 4771.679
you're the one saying that it works

4770.239 --> 4774.799999999999
well show me

4771.679 --> 4777.28
newton's model for gas behavior then

4774.8 --> 4779.1990000000005
right other than basic friction because

4777.28 --> 4781.44
that's the only thing that he actually

4779.199 --> 4783.759999999999
included

4781.44 --> 4786.08
right that he recognized there is

4783.76 --> 4788.96
friction when you drop things because of

4786.08 --> 4792.5599999999995
the air friction that's it that's like

4788.96 --> 4795.199
the only reference he gave to anything

4792.56 --> 4796.400000000001
gas or air related in his entire

4795.199 --> 4799.36
modeling

4796.4 --> 4801.5199999999995
yeah it's the only part he gave

4799.36 --> 4803.12
recognition yeah there's friction

4801.52 --> 4805.76
from air

4803.12 --> 4809.12
that's it that's the only recognition in

4805.76 --> 4812.320000000001
his entire model setup that he gave that

4809.12 --> 4816.08
gas even exists

4812.32 --> 4819.36
so why don't you go find me

4816.08 --> 4821.28
newton's model for gas behavior huh

4819.36 --> 4823.5199999999995
in his model why don't you go and

4821.28 --> 4825.679
present that since you claim

4823.52 --> 4828.719
that it is all scientifically proven and

4825.679 --> 4832.0
that it is all-inclusive yeah

4828.719 --> 4834.719
don't tell me oh show me the citation

4832.0 --> 4838.08
where the ones that made it say they

4834.719 --> 4839.84
exclude gas behavior oh really

4838.08 --> 4841.92
you think that they would say that

4839.84 --> 4844.08
they're excluding that

4841.92 --> 4846.4800000000005
maybe he did at some point it could be i

4844.08 --> 4849.6
don't know i'm not gonna dig through his

4846.48 --> 4851.839999999999
entire work to see if he sat somewhere

4849.6 --> 4854.56
if he gave some recognition to that he

4851.84 --> 4856.159000000001
was excluding gas behavior all i know is

4854.56 --> 4858.639
i looked through it

4856.159 --> 4861.759999999999
the actual newtonian model it excludes

4858.639 --> 4863.04
gas behavior except for friction

4861.76 --> 4866.0
that's it

4863.04 --> 4867.92
it doesn't it's not in there

4866.0 --> 4870.32
so hey you think

4867.92 --> 4871.1990000000005
you think newtonian model is complete

4870.32 --> 4873.759999999999
yeah

4871.199 --> 4877.919999999999
it does include gas paper well why don't

4873.76 --> 4879.92
you prove that positive assertion then

4877.92 --> 4882.4
right why don't you

4879.92 --> 4885.28
bring a quote

4882.4 --> 4889.28
why don't you write out the formula

4885.28 --> 4891.679
that specifically addresses gas behavior

4889.28 --> 4893.36
with movement with movement mechanics

4891.679 --> 4895.84
from newton yeah

4893.36 --> 4899.839999999999
you bring it up come on

4895.84 --> 4902.400000000001
show me anything other than friction

4899.84 --> 4904.8
where gas is always secondary right

4902.4 --> 4908.48
because in everything newton does

4904.8 --> 4909.76
it's always liquid solid is primary

4908.48 --> 4911.839999999999
friction

4909.76 --> 4914.159000000001
is not even

4911.84 --> 4917.28
a gas behavior

4914.159 --> 4919.679
it's what happens to an object when it

4917.28 --> 4922.32
passes through gas so it's not even

4919.679 --> 4924.639
primary it's a second there it's a side

4922.32 --> 4927.36
effect it's secondary

4924.639 --> 4931.12
it's not even like oh this is gas this

4927.36 --> 4934.0
is how it acts no it's how something

4931.12 --> 4936.8
passing through gas is influenced by gas

4934.0 --> 4940.0
that's the only notification of gas

4936.8 --> 4943.679
behavior an entire newtonian model

4940.0 --> 4945.84
so yeah so you go and show me

4943.679 --> 4947.92
the freaking evidence

4945.84 --> 4949.76
that everything i've been saying here is

4947.92 --> 4952.719
not true

4949.76 --> 4955.76
that it does include gas behavior so you

4952.719 --> 4960.4
show me the exact model for gas behavior

4955.76 --> 4960.400000000001
from newton yeah don't show me that

4960.56 --> 4965.84
einstein's oh

4962.32 --> 4970.08
oh wow noah fiddling so he made a math

4965.84 --> 4974.96
formula and that proves it's all right

4970.08 --> 4978.08
sure yes because a math equation

4974.96 --> 4980.08
absolutely is proof that something that

4978.08 --> 4981.92
doesn't even take place in physical

4980.08 --> 4985.12
reality

4981.92 --> 4987.04
that that proves that right hey it's not

4985.12 --> 4989.92
in our physical medium but if you just

4987.04 --> 4993.28
write down some stupid formula that

4989.92 --> 4995.76
proves empirically that it's physically

4993.28 --> 4995.759999999999
real

4998.48 --> 5002.799999999999
[ __ ] [ __ ]

5001.12 --> 5006.599999999999
you're a [ __ ]

5002.8 --> 5006.6
i'm gonna ban you

5015.44 --> 5021.919999999999
now don't draw that into there so you

5017.28 --> 5021.92
can start water don't scatter gun away

5024.719 --> 5029.4
dude get the [ __ ] out of here [ __ ]

5030.48 --> 5034.32
science doesn't prove it

5032.32 --> 5036.5599999999995
[ __ ] [ __ ]

5034.32 --> 5038.4
anybody who says something as [ __ ]

5036.56 --> 5040.080000000001
as science doesn't prove anything is

5038.4 --> 5042.719
instantly banned

5040.08 --> 5047.6
you are not even worthy

5042.719 --> 5047.6
to be blurting out anything in a chat

5048.719 --> 5053.04
where such conversation is taking place

5050.88 --> 5055.12
that is the dumbest thing i've ever seen

5053.04 --> 5058.239
anybody actually attempting to

5055.12 --> 5059.5199999999995
participate in a conversation about this

5058.239 --> 5062.4
it's the dumbest thing i've ever seen

5059.52 --> 5064.719
anybody like that say

5062.4 --> 5064.719
god

5065.92 --> 5071.84
yeah get the [ __ ] out of here you

5067.92 --> 5073.36
[ __ ] baltard scumbag

5071.84 --> 5075.1990000000005

scum bag

5075.199 --> 5080.4
liar

liar noah fiddling

5080.4 --> 5083.4
scumbag

5089.199 --> 5094.719
we're not your teachers well we are

5092.08 --> 5097.12
yeah but as as being a teacher i reserve

5094.719 --> 5098.8
the right to kick you the [ __ ] out of

5097.12 --> 5100.639
the room

5098.8 --> 5102.96
because you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] you

delusional [ __ ]

5105.199 --> 5108.96
who the [ __ ] do you think you are

5107.199 --> 5110.719
science doesn't prove anything you

5108.96 --> 5112.639
absolute idiot

5110.719 --> 5113.92
you indoctrinated

5112.639 --> 5117.6
[ __ ] up

5113.92 --> 5119.6
you're an indoctrinated [ __ ] up pretend

5117.6 --> 5122.159000000001
intellect okay you think that's

5122.159 --> 5128.4
[ __ ] [ __ ] it's a dumbest [ __ ]

5125.12 --> 5131.44
thing you baltards have ever come up

5128.4 --> 5134.759999999999
with science doesn't prove anything

5131.44 --> 5134.759999999999
[ __ ] [ __ ]

5141.12 --> 5145.639
yeah

sorry about the swearing but it just

5168.639 --> 5172.96
i really tried you know i really tried

5170.96 --> 5177.199
to actually try to get through them and

5172.96 --> 5178.32
then they throw that [ __ ] at me

5177.199 --> 5179.759999999999
so

5178.32 --> 5182.96
newtons

5179.76 --> 5186.2390000000005
mechanics does include guest behavior

5182.96 --> 5188.639
except no reference whatsoever

5186.239 --> 5190.799999999999
and then signs doesn't prove any are you

5188.639 --> 5192.88
[ __ ] [ __ ] me dude if you were in

5190.8 --> 5194.0
if you were in a physical class with me

5192.88 --> 5196.2390000000005
saying that

5194.0 --> 5197.28
i would literally have you kicked out of

5196.239 --> 5198.799999999999
the class

5197.28 --> 5201.04
i would tell you

5198.8 --> 5203.1990000000005
pack up your things and get the [ __ ] out

5201.04 --> 5206.159
of my classroom

5203.199 --> 5209.28
literally if you'd if you had the goal

5206.159 --> 5211.92
to say something as [ __ ] as science

5209.28 --> 5216.0
doesn't prove anything it's immediately

5211.92 --> 5216.0
kicked out of the class right

5216.48 --> 5221.199
and it lets you back in the next class

5219.28 --> 5223.84
and if you did it again

5221.199 --> 5226.239
i sent you to the principal's office and

5223.84 --> 5229.6
then with a note like this guy is a

5226.239 --> 5232.879999999999
disrupter if he does this one more time

5229.6 --> 5235.6
i'm literally going to default fail you

5232.88 --> 5239.6
on the class and you will not be allowed

5235.6 --> 5241.6
in the rest of the year yeah it's that

5239.6 --> 5244.88
[ __ ] [ __ ]

5241.6 --> 5244.88
to say something like that

5250.719 --> 5256.32
hear me

god

5326.32 --> 5332.0
yeah that's right f minus

5329.44 --> 5336.4
if you have the [ __ ] goal

5332.0 --> 5339.76
to spout out that [ __ ] nihilistic

5336.4 --> 5341.759999999999
solopsistic piece of [ __ ] remark

5339.76 --> 5345.04
science doesn't prove anything that's

5341.76 --> 5348.280000000001
immediately fail f minus

5345.04 --> 5348.28
f minus

5350.88 --> 5355.12
getting triggered when he can't engage

5352.88 --> 5357.76
in conversation

5355.12 --> 5357.76
what do you mean

5358.4 --> 5362.5599999999995
the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

5360.639 --> 5364.4800000000005
what what hey hey

5362.56 --> 5366.56
maintain the equity why don't you just

5364.48 --> 5368.08
say science doesn't prove anything you

5366.56 --> 5370.4800000000005
[ __ ] muppet

5368.08 --> 5372.8
why don't you just say that

5370.48 --> 5375.36
kick you out too

5372.8 --> 5379.6
absolutely it's just a bunch of cultist

5375.36 --> 5382.08
pieces of [ __ ] you're a literal cultist

5379.6 --> 5384.8
cultist like a cultist

5382.08 --> 5386.8
would say science doesn't prove anything

5384.8 --> 5390.320000000001
that's a cult

5386.8 --> 5393.6
like a really creepy ass

5390.32 --> 5396.48
religious cult that thinks they are

5393.6 --> 5399.280000000001
scientific right you think you're on the

5396.48 --> 5401.599999999999
side of science yet science doesn't

5399.28 --> 5403.92
prove anything you're a religious

5401.6 --> 5407.04
fanatic freak

5403.92 --> 5409.76
you're not a scientist

5407.04 --> 5411.44
you're not even with your [ __ ] mind

5409.76 --> 5412.719
in the right place you're not even in

5411.44 --> 5416.32
the world

5412.719 --> 5418.0
you're insane you're an insane cultist

5416.32 --> 5420.5599999999995
if you say science doesn't prove

5418.0 --> 5422.719
anything you are insane

5420.56 --> 5426.080000000001
if you do that

5422.719 --> 5426.08
and i will kick you out

5427.04 --> 5432.56
oh i can google it can i

5429.6 --> 5433.679
well you can also google what a unicorn

5432.56 --> 5434.56
looks like

5433.679 --> 5437.52
yeah

5434.56 --> 5438.4800000000005
doesn't make them real either

5437.52 --> 5440.56
yeah

5438.48 --> 5443.799999999999
[ __ ] [ __ ] now get the [ __ ] out of

5440.56 --> 5443.8
my room

5451.12 --> 5455.88
get out get the [ __ ] out

5474.639 --> 5479.84
professor cool yeah it's it's just

5478.0 --> 5482.159
dude i can literally

5479.84 --> 5482.159000000001
dude

5483.199 --> 5489.28
you can google

5485.52 --> 5493.6
what a unicorn looks like yeah

5489.28 --> 5493.599999999999
does that make a unicorn real

5494.0 --> 5497.28
it's so dumb

5497.6 --> 5500.88
right you can actually

5499.84 --> 5503.52
google

5500.88 --> 5506.159000000001
the coriolis effect what do you get you

5503.52 --> 5507.52
get the globio this effect

5506.159 --> 5510.5599999999995
that says

5507.52 --> 5511.2390000000005
how the earth deviation blah blah blah

5510.56 --> 5514.719
has

5511.239 --> 5516.32
absolutely nothing to do with actual

5514.719 --> 5517.76
coriolis effect which is a

5516.32 --> 5519.599999999999
scientifically

5517.76 --> 5521.52
proven effect

5519.6 --> 5522.639
way back

5521.52 --> 5525.92
it's

5522.639 --> 5528.32
apparent deviation not actual

5525.92 --> 5532.4800000000005
because of differing reference frames

5528.32 --> 5535.44
right has nothing to do with globiolus

5532.48 --> 5537.44
yeah but you can still google it though

5535.44 --> 5540.5599999999995
you can google it

5537.44 --> 5544.239
doesn't make it real it's ridiculous

5540.56 --> 5546.88
it's pseudo-scientific bullcrap

5544.239 --> 5549.599999999999
right coming from the same people that

5546.88 --> 5552.0
when actually push comes to shove say

5549.6 --> 5555.280000000001
science doesn't prove anything

5552.0 --> 5557.52
you're all a bunch of cultist freaks

5555.28 --> 5560.8
you should be wearing

5557.52 --> 5562.320000000001
hooded robes

5560.8 --> 5563.76
and walk around

5562.32 --> 5564.799999999999
smacking

5563.76 --> 5567.360000000001
your

5564.8 --> 5569.12
science book philosophy [ __ ] or

5567.36 --> 5571.199
whatever against your head like a bunch

5569.12 --> 5572.719
of cultist freaks

5571.199 --> 5576.4
your cultist

5572.719 --> 5582.28
freaks you're not scientific you're not

5576.4 --> 5582.28
even smart you're indoctrinated freak

5591.76 --> 5597.679
you're an indoctrinated freak

5594.88 --> 5599.92
you're not scientific you're not smart

5597.679 --> 5602.4800000000005
you're a delusional

5599.92 --> 5604.32
parroting freak you literally don't

5602.48 --> 5605.599999999999
understand the words coming out of your

5604.32 --> 5607.679
own mouth

5605.6 --> 5610.8
you don't know what science is you don't

5607.679 --> 5613.04
even know the history of any of it

5610.8 --> 5616.8
you don't understand the concepts you

5613.04 --> 5619.12
believe in you think that newtonian

5616.8 --> 5621.6
mechanics includes gas behavior it

5619.12 --> 5624.159
doesn't you can't prove it but you can

5621.6 --> 5626.719
scatter gun away saying that science

5624.159 --> 5629.199
doesn't prove anything as soon as you

5626.719 --> 5631.84
[ __ ] crumble in your argument and are

5629.199 --> 5633.599999999999
proven to be an absolute idiot

5631.84 --> 5635.76
then you can say science doesn't prove

5633.6 --> 5639.120000000001
anything yeah we know yeah because

5635.76 --> 5641.4400000000005
you're a [ __ ] cultist freak

5639.12 --> 5643.679
you're a cultist freak and you don't

5641.44 --> 5645.599999999999
know the [ __ ] words coming out of

5643.679 --> 5648.159
your own mouth

5645.6 --> 5650.639
should shut the [ __ ] up and sit in the

5648.159 --> 5652.32
back of the line and keep your [ __ ]

5650.639 --> 5655.12
mouth shut

5652.32 --> 5657.5199999999995
try to absorb some real knowledge

5655.12 --> 5661.28
of how things actually work

5657.52 --> 5664.96
based on history and empiricism instead

5661.28 --> 5666.4
of a bunch of blabbering philosophical

5664.96 --> 5669.679
nihilists

5666.4 --> 5673.32
that tell you [ __ ] and you gobble it

5669.679 --> 5673.32
up like a freak

5682.639 --> 5687.1990000000005
it is like the movie hot fuss indeed it

5684.96 --> 5689.92
is service day that movie is

5687.199 --> 5692.159
aging like a fine wine in its entirety

5689.92 --> 5695.6
by the way i really love that movie

5692.159 --> 5695.599999999999
i really freaking love it

5696.56 --> 5702.719
like officer angel is a personal

5699.92 --> 5706.719
inspiration to me

5702.719 --> 5706.719
this is a guy that takes no [ __ ]

5706.88 --> 5714.28
yeah although i do swear and [ __ ] he

5709.36 --> 5714.28
doesn't even swear it's like epic

5726.56 --> 5729.56
ah

5737.04 --> 5742.56
oh look at the triggered fundies

5739.36 --> 5744.48
triggered fundy cultist freaks

5742.56 --> 5746.719
they don't even know the [ __ ] words

5744.48 --> 5749.28
coming out of their own mouth

5746.719 --> 5750.639
they don't even understand what they

5749.28 --> 5753.759999999999
believe in

5750.639 --> 5756.56
because you're indoctrinated [ __ ]

5753.76 --> 5759.119000000001
you're [ __ ] you don't know what the

5756.56 --> 5760.320000000001
[ __ ] you're doing you're a delusional

5759.119 --> 5762.88
animal

5760.32 --> 5766.0
you're an animal and you don't even

5762.88 --> 5769.119
understand what's passing through you

5766.0 --> 5771.92
you have no grasp over information at

5769.119 --> 5776.5199999999995
all you're a delusional freak you're

5771.92 --> 5776.52
very triggered little funny also

5810.0 --> 5813.0
what

5818.719 --> 5822.56
right and i'm getting hungry here

5822.639 --> 5827.76
probably gonna round out the show

5826.32 --> 5831.119
a little early

5827.76 --> 5834.56
so i can have some lunch before i

5831.119 --> 5834.5599999999995
get on the flat earth debate

5834.639 --> 5838.159000000001
also i want to stop addressing this [ __ ]

5836.719 --> 5839.44
because they're now just making sock

5838.159 --> 5842.159
accounts

5839.44 --> 5844.4
because it's a scummy

5842.159 --> 5846.879999999999
cultist

5844.4 --> 5849.04
called the scumbag

5846.88 --> 5851.28
can't let it go can't let it go that

5849.04 --> 5852.88
he's a [ __ ] that he doesn't know [ __ ]

5851.28 --> 5855.44
he doesn't understand the words coming

5852.88 --> 5857.6
out of his own mouth

5855.44 --> 5859.678999999999
can't handle that when he's reminded

5857.6 --> 5861.76
about them right your parents should

5859.679 --> 5863.52
have reminded you about that maybe they

5861.76 --> 5866.0
did maybe you just walked away like a

5863.52 --> 5869.280000000001
little [ __ ] from home soon

5866.0 --> 5871.76
was too much for your ego to handle that

5869.28 --> 5873.04
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] who doesn't know

5871.76 --> 5874.639
[ __ ]

5873.04 --> 5876.719
doesn't even understand the words coming

5874.639 --> 5879.1990000000005
out of their own mouth who actually

5876.719 --> 5881.52
hangs on to science doesn't prove

5879.199 --> 5884.0
anything as an argument

5881.52 --> 5886.320000000001
[ __ ] [ __ ]

5884.0 --> 5886.32
huh

5894.08 --> 5899.199
ah carrot cake

5896.48 --> 5899.199
carrot cake

5901.28 --> 5903.599999999999
right

5902.239 --> 5907.199
i'm gonna take

5903.6 --> 5911.2390000000005
two minute break i'll be right back

5907.199 --> 5911.239
take care of the chat for me

5990.96 --> 5993.96
hmm

5999.679 --> 6005.04
yep earth is flat

6001.6 --> 6007.4400000000005
that's right it's so flat

6005.04 --> 6009.6
it's not even a hint

6007.44 --> 6012.159
any kind of geometry other than a

6009.6 --> 6014.08
perfect flat surface

6012.159 --> 6016.239
not a hint

6014.08 --> 6019.44
i mean you could think of the horizon as

6016.239 --> 6020.718999999999
it as if it were earth curve

6019.44 --> 6022.719
but it isn't

6020.719 --> 6024.32
because the black swan observations

6022.719 --> 6028.4800000000005
completely

6024.32 --> 6028.48
put that option off the table

6029.28 --> 6032.32
it's off the table

6033.92 --> 6037.4400000000005
right

6035.04 --> 6039.6
can't be that ball

6037.44 --> 6041.678999999999
it's flat

6039.6 --> 6044.0
it's not that ball

6041.679 --> 6045.84
right and then you got the section that

6044.0 --> 6049.44
tool that was used during the

6045.84 --> 6052.400000000001
exploration age to actually get around

6049.44 --> 6054.32
to navigate the oceans based on the

6052.4 --> 6057.5199999999995
celestial angles

6054.32 --> 6059.28
yeah yeah it requires

6057.52 --> 6061.4400000000005
flat lines

6059.28 --> 6064.719
for your angle

6061.44 --> 6065.5199999999995
you know that requires a flat surface

6064.719 --> 6067.36
right

6065.52 --> 6069.280000000001
so the black swan proves it's not a

6067.36 --> 6072.08
globe

6069.28 --> 6074.0
sexton proves it is

6072.08 --> 6075.6
flat

6074.0 --> 6077.52
because you require

6075.6 --> 6079.4400000000005
a straight line

6077.52 --> 6082.400000000001
to make an angle

6079.44 --> 6084.48
yeah otherwise the tool doesn't function

6082.4 --> 6086.0
so the earth is

6084.48 --> 6088.638999999999
flat

6086.0 --> 6092.8
has to be otherwise you couldn't use

6088.639 --> 6096.2390000000005
that instrument that was widely used

6092.8 --> 6099.92
not by a singular party no by com

6096.239 --> 6101.599999999999
competing parties around the world

6099.92 --> 6103.92
on the world

6101.6 --> 6106.8
it's used by competing parties to

6103.92 --> 6110.0
navigate oceans very hazardous process

6106.8 --> 6112.320000000001
very dangerous yeah it requires

6110.0 --> 6115.199
flat baseline

6112.32 --> 6118.32
for an angle otherwise it doesn't work

6115.199 --> 6121.119
you can't use a sextant

6118.32 --> 6124.239
on anything other than a flat earth

6121.119 --> 6126.48
so it is flat provably flat

6124.239 --> 6128.879999999999
yeah black swan

6126.48 --> 6131.599999999999
completely does away with the notion

6128.88 --> 6134.92
that there's any form of curvature

6131.6 --> 6134.92
it's flat

6135.119 --> 6140.799999999999
horizon is not essential for the success

6137.679 --> 6141.6
except you always use it though don't

6140.8 --> 6145.04
you

6141.6 --> 6147.1990000000005
yeah how do you operate the sextant

6145.04 --> 6150.08
take the mirror

6147.199 --> 6153.04
then you take the reflection of the sun

6150.08 --> 6155.44
and then you equalize it with

6153.04 --> 6158.08
the horizon

6155.44 --> 6161.599999999999
the horizon you put the sun on the

6158.08 --> 6162.5599999999995
horizon and now you got a precise angle

6161.6 --> 6164.56
yeah

6162.56 --> 6167.280000000001
so

6164.56 --> 6170.8
the horizon is essential it's literally

6167.28 --> 6174.239
in the middle of the standard process

6170.8 --> 6178.719
like the most basic process of what you

6174.239 --> 6180.4
do with a sextant operates directly with

6178.719 --> 6182.4800000000005
the horizon

6180.4 --> 6184.4
so you're either wrong and you don't

6182.48 --> 6186.159
know what the [ __ ] you're talking about

6184.4 --> 6188.32
because you're a cultist

6186.159 --> 6189.199
nora the nutter

6188.32 --> 6191.04
or

6189.199 --> 6193.759999999999
you're a liar

6191.04 --> 6196.56
i think you're probably a liar

6193.76 --> 6198.719
since you got this freaked up malformed

6196.56 --> 6200.4800000000005
face troll shitty thing

6198.719 --> 6202.8
i'm just gonna ban you because you're

6200.48 --> 6205.799999999999
not even a real person you're just a

6202.8 --> 6205.8
scumbag

6206.239 --> 6210.159
you can get the [ __ ] out of here too

6208.4 --> 6213.44
liar

6210.159 --> 6215.92
yeah don't tolerate lies here you don't

6213.44 --> 6219.28
tolerate lies

6215.92 --> 6222.159
get the [ __ ] out cultist caught this

6219.28 --> 6224.96
little scumbag

6222.159 --> 6229.28
you don't lie here

6224.96 --> 6229.28
i'm gonna kick you out immediately

6230.159 --> 6236.08
can anybody think of any way

6233.84 --> 6237.4400000000005
to form a horizon in a room with no

6236.08 --> 6240.48
windows

6237.44 --> 6244.839999999999
well we're not in a room with no windows

6240.48 --> 6248.08
the oceans are not in a room with no

6244.84 --> 6249.679
windows you're not supposed to use

6248.08 --> 6251.44
a sextant

6249.679 --> 6253.92
in a cave

6251.44 --> 6256.32
you're supposed to use it in the outside

6253.92 --> 6256.32
world

6257.679 --> 6264.159
am i able yo i'm able to kick you out

6260.239 --> 6267.44
you [ __ ] little cultist scumbag

6264.159 --> 6267.44
with your scatter gunning

6267.679 --> 6273.1990000000005
distraction away

6269.76 --> 6275.280000000001
from the fact that you require

6273.199 --> 6278.0
a flat baseline

6275.28 --> 6280.48
for a sextant to work and that in the

6278.0 --> 6282.96
classical operation of it right and

6280.48 --> 6284.32
we're talking about several centuries of

6282.96 --> 6285.76
use

6284.32 --> 6287.28
what you did

6285.76 --> 6289.360000000001
is match

6287.28 --> 6292.88
the horizon

6289.36 --> 6294.0
with the exact position of the sun that

6292.88 --> 6297.4400000000005
was

6294.0 --> 6300.88
the main operation of using a sextant so

6297.44 --> 6303.839999999999
anybody saying you don't need all right

6300.88 --> 6306.88
you don't need it oh that's very cute

6303.84 --> 6309.679
that you don't need it but it was always

6306.88 --> 6311.119
used though always

6309.679 --> 6313.84
always

6311.119 --> 6317.839999999999
hundreds of years they always use the

6313.84 --> 6321.679
horizon in a sextant every single time

6317.84 --> 6324.4800000000005
yeah that's why they had the eye patch

6321.679 --> 6326.719
you don't even [ __ ] know that do you

6324.48 --> 6328.718999999999
yeah why did they have the eye patch not

6326.719 --> 6331.04
because every freaking

6328.719 --> 6332.159
sailor had his eye jabbed out no they

6331.04 --> 6334.56
did that

6332.159 --> 6336.879999999999
because they needed an extra piece of

6334.56 --> 6338.2390000000005
cloth so they wouldn't go completely

6336.88 --> 6340.96
blind

6338.239 --> 6344.32
from using the sextant

6340.96 --> 6346.4800000000005
where they match the sun which you then

6344.32 --> 6348.96
literally look at

6346.48 --> 6350.638999999999
with the horizon and they put the eye

6348.96 --> 6353.76
patch on so they wouldn't blind

6350.639 --> 6356.32
themselves they had to look through that

6353.76 --> 6359.679
and see where the sun was it's basically

6356.32 --> 6363.36
like a filter an eyepatch for pirate of

6359.679 --> 6366.56
a sailor is a filter so they can use a

6363.36 --> 6369.04
sextant without getting completely blind

6366.56 --> 6371.76
yeah that's what it's for because they

6369.04 --> 6375.44
had to as an operation every single time

6371.76 --> 6377.76
you use it for hundreds of years match

6375.44 --> 6378.5599999999995
the sun position

6377.76 --> 6383.679
with

6378.56 --> 6387.119000000001
the horizon i don't care if you can

6383.679 --> 6388.4800000000005
use a section without horizon they've

6387.119 --> 6393.199
always

6388.48 --> 6394.48
used the horizon they've always used the

6393.199 --> 6396.638999999999
horizon

6394.48 --> 6400.239
when operating a sextant

6396.639 --> 6402.96
they've always used the horizon and

6400.239 --> 6406.48
that's historical fact and there's

6402.96 --> 6409.119
nothing you can do the scatter gun away

6406.48 --> 6411.28
with your shitty little side track

6409.119 --> 6412.88
arguments that have no relevance

6411.28 --> 6415.199
whatsoever

6412.88 --> 6416.2390000000005
okay there's nothing you can do to stop

6415.199 --> 6418.638999999999
it

6416.239 --> 6421.759999999999
the sextant proves the earth is flat and

6418.639 --> 6425.679
there's nothing you can do to scurry

6421.76 --> 6427.76
away from that fact historically

6425.679 --> 6431.36
provable fact

6427.76 --> 6434.8
that they've always used the horizon

6431.36 --> 6437.36
when operating a sextant for hundreds of

6434.8 --> 6441.96
years and there's nothing you can do

6437.36 --> 6441.96
about it you little [ __ ]

6444.48 --> 6451.599999999999
now get the [ __ ] out

6447.84 --> 6454.400000000001
you filthy [ __ ] scumbag spamming

6451.6 --> 6459.4400000000005
pieces of [ __ ] anti-flat earthers suck

6454.4 --> 6459.44
[ __ ] [ __ ] trolls get the [ __ ] out

6462.56 --> 6465.92
these [ __ ]

6464.08 --> 6468.5599999999995
[ __ ] off

6465.92 --> 6470.4800000000005
get the [ __ ] out of here all of you get

6468.56 --> 6472.8
the [ __ ] out of here

6470.48 --> 6474.879999999999
you unbelievable [ __ ] i'm not even

6472.8 --> 6476.8
gonna attempt

6474.88 --> 6479.28
to answer any more of your questions i

6476.8 --> 6480.56
know what i'm talking about i am not

6479.28 --> 6484.159
here

6480.56 --> 6485.6
to answer your stupid little scattergun

6484.159 --> 6489.36
questions

6485.6 --> 6489.360000000001
that avoid the fact

6490.719 --> 6495.92
yeah avoid the fact

6493.6 --> 6497.360000000001
that the earth is flat there's nothing

6495.92 --> 6499.679
you can do

6497.36 --> 6502.4
nothing you can do you cannot scatter

6499.679 --> 6504.2390000000005
gun away i'm not allowing it

6502.4 --> 6507.679
not allowing that you're all getting

6504.239 --> 6509.599999999999
banned all of you every single one

6507.679 --> 6514.8
because i don't give a [ __ ] i'm gonna

6509.6 --> 6516.08
give it to you how it is the reality

6514.8 --> 6518.320000000001
yeah

6516.08 --> 6520.96
there's nothing you can do about it

6518.32 --> 6524.719
you cultist [ __ ]

6520.96 --> 6527.119
cultists pieces of [ __ ] [ __ ]

6524.719 --> 6529.44
lying to yourself

6527.119 --> 6531.44
lying to everybody

6529.44 --> 6532.96
and being okay with that that you're a

6531.44 --> 6537.919999999999
liar

6532.96 --> 6537.92
disgusting little troll maggots

6544.08 --> 6548.08
everything i've said is historical fact

6546.4 --> 6549.44
and there's not a [ __ ] thing you can

6548.08 --> 6553.679
do about it

6549.44 --> 6555.839999999999
not a thing it's all fact

6553.679 --> 6559.84
sextants have always

6555.84 --> 6563.04
been operated using the horizon every

6559.84 --> 6566.08
single [ __ ] time in history always

6563.04 --> 6569.119
that i don't care what they've made

6566.08 --> 6571.119
since then yeah all those extra thingies

6569.119 --> 6574.08
they were never there because they

6571.119 --> 6576.4
always used the horizon that's why

6574.08 --> 6578.96
sailors had eye patches not because they

6576.4 --> 6582.638999999999
were all jab their eyes out

6578.96 --> 6585.36
but because they needed the cloth to

6582.639 --> 6590.0
prevent themselves from going blind as

6585.36 --> 6595.44
they were using the sextant to match the

6590.0 --> 6597.36
position of the sun with the horizon

6595.44 --> 6600.159
and to prevent themselves from going

6597.36 --> 6602.799999999999
blind they had an eye patch

6600.159 --> 6605.36
so they could still look at the sun

6602.8 --> 6607.599
without completely blinding themselves

6605.36 --> 6611.44
that's why they had it that's why all

6607.599 --> 6613.04
the captains had it because

6611.44 --> 6616.48
yeah

6613.04 --> 6618.4
if you could operate a sexton

6616.48 --> 6620.239
it's very likely you had an eye patch or

6618.4 --> 6622.48
you at least had it on you right they

6620.239 --> 6624.959999999999
might have just had the eye patch like

6622.48 --> 6626.718999999999
in on their hat

6624.96 --> 6630.719
they wouldn't even be wearing it all the

6626.719 --> 6633.28
time right maybe they really liked it

6630.719 --> 6635.599
to just be able to see in 3d

6633.28 --> 6636.639
but then yeah oh we're going to use the

6635.599 --> 6640.56
sexton

6636.639 --> 6643.1990000000005
put it on use the sexton not get blinded

6640.56 --> 6644.56
from looking directly into the sun

6643.199 --> 6648.36
right

6644.56 --> 6648.360000000001
that's why they had it

6660.32 --> 6663.28
no i

6661.76 --> 6664.88
that's interesting

6663.28 --> 6666.8
george sanford that might have been a

6664.88 --> 6668.719
double function

6666.8 --> 6670.719
that's very interesting actually that

6668.719 --> 6672.5
you say that

6670.719 --> 6673.599
that they might have also used it to

6672.5 --> 6675.52
[Music]

6673.599 --> 6676.96
keep one eye

6675.52 --> 6680.320000000001
in the dark

6676.96 --> 6682.719
so if they go inside they wouldn't first

6680.32 --> 6684.5599999999995
have to like uh

6682.719 --> 6687.28
still blind it from the sun so they

6684.56 --> 6688.88
could just quickly use that and see well

6687.28 --> 6690.239
in the dark that's actually really

6688.88 --> 6693.119
interesting here at sanford they might

6690.239 --> 6695.199
have had a double function for that

6693.119 --> 6697.92
that's that's fascinating i never i've

6695.199 --> 6700.239
never thought about that

6697.92 --> 6700.2390000000005
huh

6703.04 --> 6706.96
but it it would not have been

6704.719 --> 6708.56
exclusively for that that's that would

6706.96 --> 6710.2390000000005
have been ridiculous why would you have

6708.56 --> 6712.56
your one eye

6710.239 --> 6714.718999999999
darkened all day just so you have the

6712.56 --> 6716.8
temporary advantage of going into a dark

6714.719 --> 6721.0
boat and quickly seeing things

6716.8 --> 6721.0
that would be kind of crazy

6722.639 --> 6726.159000000001
but it could have been like a

6724.4 --> 6728.638999999999
a handy double

6726.159 --> 6729.759999999999
functional trick that's interesting

6728.639 --> 6733.679
right

6729.76 --> 6735.679
anyway i'm rounding out the show

6733.679 --> 6739.119
