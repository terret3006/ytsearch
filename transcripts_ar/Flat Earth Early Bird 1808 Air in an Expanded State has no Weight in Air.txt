go

321.52 --> 328.039
okay right so yeah

325.199 --> 331.319
yesterday it got a bit

328.039 --> 334.199
late again

331.319 --> 334.199
watch a couple of

335.96 --> 344.28
movies like historic War related

339.88 --> 344.28
movies they happen to be kind of

352.4 --> 358.56
good H what's it called

356.039 --> 360.4
again the first movie that I watched was

358.56 --> 363.319
actually really good but I knew it was

360.4 --> 365.44
going to be really good because I heard

363.319 --> 368.88
a lot of compliments in associated with

365.44 --> 370.84
that name in association with that

368.88 --> 373.24
name I

370.84 --> 375.67999999999995
think oh yeah trying to find something

373.24 --> 379.319
back on net like that's a good one just

375.68 --> 379.319
go to IMDb and guess

382.35 --> 385.47900000000004
[Music]

388.4 --> 391.4
it

395.039 --> 401.599
yeah I knew it yeah it's a pretty recent

397.639 --> 405.24
one all is quiet at the Western All

401.599 --> 409.56
Quiet on the Western Front very long two

405.24 --> 412.8
and half our movie of World War I pretty

409.56 --> 414.96
much from a German solders perspective

412.8 --> 420.319
and it is

414.96 --> 421.35999999999996
gruesome I mean this movie is like

420.319 --> 425.8
very

421.36 --> 430.8
harsh it is like and but like I

425.8 --> 430.8
like how it was just kind of just

431.0 --> 437.08
German it was a very interesting movie

434.0 --> 439.68
really it was really very

437.08 --> 443.19899999999996
interesting like from a historical

439.68 --> 443.199
perspective was very

446.639 --> 451.36
serious and it did definitely like

449.44 --> 453.8
portray the

451.36 --> 456.40000000000003
horrors what was that other movie that I

453.8 --> 458.479
watched that had that like singular shot

456.4 --> 463.71999999999997
that would last like 20 minutes and kind

458.479 --> 466.36
of thing that was really like the

463.72 --> 470.0
atmosphere

466.36 --> 471.96000000000004
like the visuals of that was very

470.0 --> 474.24
emphasized in that movie in this one

471.96 --> 477.79999999999995
it's really like kind of like what it

474.24 --> 477.8
was like for the

478.319 --> 481.91900000000004
soldiers

480.319 --> 483.68
and in that sense this movie was

481.919 --> 486.479
actually better even though the other

483.68 --> 490.08
one had really interesting video work

486.479 --> 492.71999999999997
very interesting and this one was just

490.08 --> 492.71999999999997
really well

493.44 --> 498.08
done but I mean it is a messed up movie

496.44 --> 499.919
I mean at the end of it you do feel

498.08 --> 502.71999999999997
right kind of

499.919 --> 508.24
sick because of everything that's

502.72 --> 511.24
happened and you're supposed to I mean

508.24 --> 511.24
yeah

521.919 --> 527.8
right so that was movie number one that

523.959 --> 531.56
I watched and the other one damn

527.8 --> 531.56
it was it count

531.92 --> 535.959
again this one's harder to

537.079 --> 542.12
guess let's see how how did you doing

539.88 --> 542.12
that

544.48 --> 550.9590000000001
again it's in the account you could see

548.519 --> 550.9590000000001
it

552.44 --> 556.2790000000001
right the hell was

568.12 --> 571.12
that

584.48 --> 587.48
how did that work

593.04 --> 599.3199999999999
again what there way to to figure out

597.16 --> 601.76
like what you've been watching I don't

599.32 --> 607.279
remember how that

601.76 --> 607.279
worked anyway right so I don't

607.56 --> 614.399
know no it's not a a crossbow on the

611.12 --> 618.0
wall God damn

614.399 --> 621.56
you not a crossbow it is never a

618.0 --> 624.88
crossbow have you ever seen a

621.56 --> 628.04
crossbow have you ever seen a crossbow

624.88 --> 631.04
that's hung on the wall looking like

628.04 --> 631.04
that

633.0 --> 635.64
it's a

640.959 --> 644.56
bow not a

658.04 --> 661.04
crossbow

697.76 --> 706.59

1100.28 --> 1105.0
that I'm good for in life is being

1102.2 --> 1108.0
[ __ ] angry so everybody can be amused

1105.0 --> 1109.84
enough to throw me some trinket so I can

1108.0 --> 1114.159

1148.559 --> 1156.0
30 people that generally support on a

1152.48 --> 1159.48
regular basis that continually drop

1156.0 --> 1162.039
by like what you do nobody seems to give

1159.48 --> 1163.76
a [ __ ] about what I do except for a

1162.039 --> 1166.72
couple of

1163.76 --> 1169.24
people and every time I get angry I feel

1166.72 --> 1172.44

all nice and encouraging and I guess I'm

1189.32 --> 1195.28
just not popular and I'm never going to

1193.12 --> 1197.84
[ __ ] be popular no matter what the

1272.4 --> 1279.5590000000002
thing I can get out of that why the [ __ ]

1276.44 --> 1282.0
does my YouTube have a 10 minute delay

1279.559 --> 1282.0
this

1283.44 --> 1291.919
[ __ ] so I accept American doll I

1287.039 --> 1295.52

1295.52 --> 1300.08
matter you can throw anything you could

1298.559 --> 1303.9189999999999
you could

1300.08 --> 1305.9189999999999
throw whatever the [ __ ] thing from a

1303.919 --> 1309.0
foreign country that nobody's ever heard

right do your work outside of YouTube

1346.96 --> 1349.96

1370.76 --> 1375.76
everything that I

1372.44 --> 1378.1200000000001
work is literally like I literally make

1375.76 --> 1379.679
nothing out of it because of how things

1378.12 --> 1384.08
are set

1379.679 --> 1387.44
up that's why unless I exceed in the

1384.08 --> 1387.4399999999998
amount that I

1387.48 --> 1393.72
make then I actually get to keep some of

1390.279 --> 1398.159
it isn't that amazing works really great

1393.72 --> 1398.159
when you have just like absolutely

1398.559 --> 1403.9189999999999

is it like like that

1745.279 --> 1748.519
there yeah

1749.44 --> 1753.559
no they're all provided

1753.679 --> 1758.72
for and there's like professionals that

1756.399 --> 1761.399
get the job that have been working at

1758.72 --> 1765.08
that for like 20 years

1761.399 --> 1768.4399999999998
straight yeah you're not going to get a

1765.08 --> 1770.799
job as a newbie with that at all all the

1768.44 --> 1773.48
only thing that you can do with such

1770.799 --> 1776.96
professions is just do it for

1773.48 --> 1778.799
yourself and try to save some cost doing

1776.96 --> 1781.48
those things for yourself like that's

1778.799 --> 1784.24
all you can get out of that at this

1781.48 --> 1787.44
point AJ T because if you're going to go

1784.24 --> 1791.1200000000001
professional route like you're only

1787.44 --> 1791.1200000000001
going to be tinkering to the rich

1791.559 --> 1796.9189999999999
anyway because it's all super expensive

1795.24 --> 1801.36
if you if it's all legal with all the

1796.919 --> 1805.64
tax nonsense super expensive any hiring

1801.36 --> 1807.8799999999999
anybody to do anything here is insanely

1805.64 --> 1811.279
expensive

1807.88 --> 1814.0800000000002
really at this point and it's all

1811.279 --> 1816.12
logical

1814.08 --> 1819.24
but

1816.12 --> 1823.4399999999998
yeah if you're a newcomer you're just

1819.24 --> 1825.519
[ __ ] with it like unless you have like

1823.44 --> 1828.24
part of a family or a

1825.519 --> 1832.08
company you have connection with and you

1828.24 --> 1832.08
do that and then you might get

1833.279 --> 1838.44
lucky right because I mean all these

1836.08 --> 1841.0
guys out there they're all like hiring

1838.44 --> 1843.96
people they know and all that and like

1841.0 --> 1847.12
yeah that's what I would do too you

1843.96 --> 1850.519
don't want to get get a bunch of new

1847.12 --> 1852.36
weirdos especially in these crazy times

1850.519 --> 1854.64
you only want the people that you know

1852.36 --> 1854.6399999999999
are

1855.88 --> 1860.8400000000001
reliable right in tough times that's

1859.159 --> 1862.96
just how it works because more people

1860.84 --> 1866.4399999999998
will be

1862.96 --> 1868.919
flipping and newcomers will be failing

1866.44 --> 1868.919
it just

1871.36 --> 1876.0
happens yeah very easy to become an

1873.48 --> 1878.88
apprentice yeah especially at 43 years

1876.0 --> 1881.84
old that's just so easy man anybody take

1878.88 --> 1881.8400000000001
you

1885.48 --> 1890.3990000000001
sure especially if you're really well

1888.12 --> 1892.12
spoken and probably going to be more

1890.399 --> 1894.8799999999999
well spoken than the person you're going

1892.12 --> 1897.399
to be working for I mean I'm sure

1894.88 --> 1899.6390000000001
they'll just be perfectly comfortable

1897.399 --> 1899.639

people would be able to support me for

2235.96 --> 2240.4
doing should be a meteorologist they get

2238.72 --> 2242.7599999999998
it wrong all yeah but the whole point

2240.4 --> 2245.1600000000003
about meteorologist is that you are a

2242.76 --> 2245.1600000000003
social

2245.599 --> 2251.2000000000003
engineer meteorologist is just like

you are specifically there having that

2253.96 --> 2261.079
job to be indoctrinated by ball nonsense

2258.359 --> 2262.44
and the latest oh the terrible thing

2261.079 --> 2264.48
that could happen that everybody needs

2262.44 --> 2266.2000000000003
to pay taxes for

2264.48 --> 2269.0
specifically that's what you're then

2266.2 --> 2271.2
going to be doing right that's why they

get to keep their job even though they

2271.2 --> 2274.56
are always

2272.599 --> 2278.599
wrong because they're part of a

that's

2331.44 --> 2337.839
awesome I wish that I had become an

2334.52 --> 2340.119
electrician when I was younger but I was

2337.839 --> 2342.24
afraid of electricity I was afraid of

2340.119 --> 2343.6400000000003
getting shocked seriously that was the

2342.24 --> 2347.72
reason I didn't do

2343.64 --> 2351.0
it cuz I was I've been genuinely phobic

2347.72 --> 2355.0
for electricity for a big part of my

2351.0 --> 2357.96
life cuz I got shocked one

2355.0 --> 2362.079
time and that was just the the pain of

it like kept following me in my

2362.079 --> 2367.8390000000004
dreams

2364.52 --> 2370.64
so I really really wish I didn't have

2367.839 --> 2372.88
that cuz then I probably just become an

2370.64 --> 2376.1189999999997
electrician and become really [ __ ]

2372.88 --> 2379.119
good at it but I didn't cuz I'm a

2464.319 --> 2468.839
try it oh you want to try that a

2465.96 --> 2473.4
profession oh yeah that seems to [ __ ]

2468.839 --> 2473.4
happen with me every goddamn time I try

2473.76 --> 2480.4
anything you want to be a taxi driver oh

2476.319 --> 2485.4
oh oh yeah oh yeah now it's done now

2480.4 --> 2488.2400000000002
it's over as a profession just done now

2485.4 --> 2488.2400000000002
not any longer

2490.359 --> 2494.92
maybe I should just seek out some more

2492.72 --> 2498.5989999999997
professions that are about to become

2494.92 --> 2501.079
outdated and then naturally become super

2498.599 --> 2504.52
enthusiastic about it so that I could

2501.079 --> 2505.5600000000004
just die with it once I realize how

2504.52 --> 2510.8
[ __ ]

2505.56 --> 2510.7999999999997
outdated my career choices were once

2512.96 --> 2518.079
again couldn't imagine me as a taxi

2515.44 --> 2520.76
driver that's it's very easy to imagine

2518.079 --> 2524.119
imagine me you're going to see much more

2520.76 --> 2525.96
of the back of my head and then either

2524.119 --> 2528.4
I'll be completely

2525.96 --> 2532.4
silent just absolutely

2528.4 --> 2535.88
nothing or I'll literally never stop

2532.4 --> 2537.44
talking if you allow me I'll just do

2535.88 --> 2540.839
kind of the blabbering that I do on the

2537.44 --> 2543.44
early bir show I would do that that's

2540.839 --> 2543.44
how it would

2545.16 --> 2548.16
work

2552.079 --> 2556.559
I did Sil in school what does that

2556.8 --> 2560.96
mean mystical Rock AR I don't even

2559.92 --> 2564.44
understand what that

2560.96 --> 2567.28
means what do you mean did silver in

2564.44 --> 2567.28
school what does that

2570.48 --> 2574.88
mean didn't go well for Robert

2575.16 --> 2578.16
toiro

2580.18 --> 2586.52
[Music]

2583.52 --> 2586.52
gross

2589.4 --> 2594.28
anyway Go's

2591.8 --> 2596.119
missing you don't get that in school you

2594.28 --> 2598.079
have to like study for

2596.119 --> 2600.4
it and

2598.079 --> 2602.599
yes I

2600.4 --> 2606.7200000000003
did that's

2602.599 --> 2609.6400000000003
why all the jewelry I wear I made it's

2606.72 --> 2611.8799999999997
like one of my personal rules it's

2609.64 --> 2615.44
actually the reason why I became a

2611.88 --> 2615.44
Goldsmith if I really had to be

2616.559 --> 2622.92
honest I already knew like you're never

2620.24 --> 2625.7999999999997
going to be able to actually financially

2622.92 --> 2628.839
survive off that like absolutely I knew

2625.8 --> 2631.04
that before I even

2628.839 --> 2633.44
started I wanted to do it because I

2631.04 --> 2637.16
wanted to learn how to do it and I

2633.44 --> 2641.119
wanted to have my own jewelry

2637.16 --> 2644.64
yeah that's how dumb and

2641.119 --> 2649.44
selfish my decision was that I I went on

2644.64 --> 2649.44
study just because I wanted it for

2650.96 --> 2659.2
myself and yeah in a way I am glad of

2656.24 --> 2663.4799999999996
it but my god when you look at it

2659.2 --> 2663.48
financially that is so unbelievably

2665.0 --> 2668.0
irresponsible

2672.52 --> 2681.319
really but I mean nobody in my family at

2676.48 --> 2681.319
that point even cared about what I was

2681.48 --> 2686.44
doing they didn't

2683.52 --> 2687.559
care it was already like everybody's giv

2686.44 --> 2689.76
up on

2687.559 --> 2692.599
me in that

2689.76 --> 2694.96
sense they were just happy that I would

2692.599 --> 2696.8
not be depressed anymore and get kind of

2694.96 --> 2698.319
activated

2696.8 --> 2701.7200000000003
like that's the only thing they cared

2698.319 --> 2704.359
about they my my family when I was a

2701.72 --> 2705.64
teenager did not think I was going to

2704.359 --> 2708.48
accomplish

2705.64 --> 2709.72
anything and I really wanted them to see

2708.48 --> 2712.64
me like

2709.72 --> 2714.9199999999996
that cuz I wanted to accomplish they

2712.64 --> 2717.72
didn't they didn't think I could do it

2714.92 --> 2720.599
because I just had too many quirks and

2717.72 --> 2724.2799999999997
issues and doubts

2720.599 --> 2726.96
and getting in my own way and then they

2724.28 --> 2731.8
just gave up that's a

2726.96 --> 2731.8
great it's a great place to be

2732.68 --> 2738.359
at right when you know people are giving

2735.68 --> 2740.64
up on you not because they are just

2738.359 --> 2745.119
[ __ ] and jealous or something but

2740.64 --> 2749.319
because they genuinely size you up as

2745.119 --> 2751.319
incapable so yeah like literally

2749.319 --> 2754.319
[ __ ] that's what it feels like it's

2751.319 --> 2757.88
like oh I got this brain but despite the

2754.319 --> 2757.88
brain I'm still

2758.64 --> 2764.8799999999997
[ __ ] so I have more intelligence to

2761.839 --> 2769.24
be aware of my horrendous

2764.88 --> 2772.88
flaw isn't that just great isn't that

2769.24 --> 2776.68
just [ __ ] great makes life really

2772.88 --> 2779.52
enjoyable once you realize that about

2776.68 --> 2781.5989999999997
yourself and I'm yes being sarcastic if

2779.52 --> 2784.8
you don't realize that then you are even

2781.599 --> 2787.76
more [ __ ] than I

2784.8 --> 2789.599
am

2787.76 --> 2792.3590000000004
which is definitely something that

2789.599 --> 2795.48
exists out there people that are more

2792.359 --> 2795.48
[ __ ] than me

2796.8 --> 2802.52
yeah I'm just saying just because you're

2800.0 --> 2805.359
smart doesn't mean you you're not

2802.52 --> 2807.8
[ __ ] absolutely not I'm the living

2805.359 --> 2807.7999999999997
proof of

2808.599 --> 2813.8
it silver artist yeah that's super cute

2812.079 --> 2816.2400000000002
yeah what

2813.8 --> 2817.4
artist yeah they don't give a [ __ ] [ __ ]

2816.24 --> 2823.5589999999997
because I'm

2817.4 --> 2826.839
not a clou swap dick sucking Eugenics

2823.559 --> 2828.92
freak yeah don't you understand that

2826.839 --> 2833.119
that's how that

2828.92 --> 2835.04
works in art if you don't suck the dick

2833.119 --> 2840.28
of the latest

2835.04 --> 2842.7599999999998
thing suck up to the evil of the day

2840.28 --> 2844.7200000000003
then you don't get

2842.76 --> 2846.559
anything

2844.72 --> 2849.7599999999998
yeah

2846.559 --> 2853.8390000000004
then you're just ignored like the rest

2849.76 --> 2856.2000000000003
of it you don't get the big sales and

2853.839 --> 2859.359
the big popularities if you don't play

2856.2 --> 2864.3999999999996
their sick psychotic demon

2859.359 --> 2866.96
game yeah like even when Owen was going

2864.4 --> 2870.599
after jimbob for like sort of making

2866.96 --> 2872.96
pizza gate themed jewelry he's like oh

2870.599 --> 2877.48
my God that's so disgusting oh look at

2872.96 --> 2880.68
I'm like yeah yeah yeah that it is but

2877.48 --> 2883.96
then the other like but he's a Goldsmith

2880.68 --> 2887.319
though you have no idea what that's like

2883.96 --> 2889.88
to be a freaking Goldsmith out there if

2887.319 --> 2894.2
you even attempt to try to be successful

2889.88 --> 2896.52
you have to Pander to Demons like

2894.2 --> 2898.5589999999997
absolutely no other way around it so

2896.52 --> 2901.2
like I didn't even think it was that

2898.559 --> 2903.88
egregious it's like yeah yeah well

2901.2 --> 2906.24
you're a Goldsmith so that's what you

2903.88 --> 2908.76
got to do because otherwise you just

2906.24 --> 2912.2
don't get

2908.76 --> 2915.5200000000004
anything yeah I mean unless you got a

2912.2 --> 2918.9199999999996
better idea for jewelry ah Big

2915.52 --> 2921.0
Bear got a better idea bear T jewelry

2918.92 --> 2924.44
yeah oh wait oh yeah yeah you don't like

2921.0 --> 2929.119
jewelry yeah yeah that's

2924.44 --> 2930.7200000000003
why it's not cool isn't it right well if

2929.119 --> 2932.079
you're a jewel or you want to send Jewel

2930.72 --> 2934.4399999999996
you're going to have to sell it to

2932.079 --> 2936.44
people that do think it's cool and guess

2934.44 --> 2940.92
what they're into

2936.44 --> 2940.92
demonic eugenic [ __ ]

2945.359 --> 2950.04
so

2947.04 --> 2952.5589999999997
yeah well I mean you can be a very

2950.04 --> 2956.04
proficient very good Advanced Goldsmith

2952.559 --> 2959.799
and not be evil you're just going to be

2956.04 --> 2962.0
kind of poor and working never non-stop

2959.799 --> 2964.52
just you just never stop working because

2962.0 --> 2966.88
people will want your your work and all

2964.52 --> 2970.359
that you just don't really get too much

2966.88 --> 2973.4
out of it and the tax system is going to

2970.359 --> 2975.2
like Rob everything you got every time

2973.4 --> 2978.4
that that's how you live

2975.2 --> 2983.319
then yeah I didn't want to do

2978.4 --> 2987.96
that but I wasn't really capable of like

2983.319 --> 2992.2
making evil [ __ ] either my tactic was a

2987.96 --> 2996.319
fail tactic but it was basically how

2992.2 --> 2997.839
about if I just find a way through like

2996.319 --> 3000.68
through the

2997.839 --> 3004.68
reality like what if I just figure out

3000.68 --> 3004.68
something that's

3005.04 --> 3012.319
new and like has the appealing things of

3009.0 --> 3015.359
evil without having the bad sides of

3012.319 --> 3017.839
evil so that I could

3015.359 --> 3020.24
deflect that impulse that is in the

3017.839 --> 3022.44
youth that I had too that made the

3020.24 --> 3024.799
darkness and control and might so

3022.44 --> 3028.319
appealing and they deflect it to

3024.799 --> 3031.24
something more more durable and less

3028.319 --> 3033.44
evil conjure something new like a

3031.24 --> 3036.359
completely new

3033.44 --> 3039.44
reality and that's what I did try to do

3036.359 --> 3040.64
and it's like how I I got into being and

3039.44 --> 3043.44
everything that I

3040.64 --> 3045.359
made and even my spiritual research in

3043.44 --> 3047.28
spirit mechanics eventually is what it

3045.359 --> 3050.839
turned

3047.28 --> 3054.44
into it was my attempt like if I can't

3050.839 --> 3056.04
make it out there I just don't want to

3054.44 --> 3057.92
suffer

3056.04 --> 3059.5589999999997
it's like oh oh you're with the you're

3057.92 --> 3062.319
not with the Devils okay then you're

3059.559 --> 3063.76
poor and then just live like that or you

3062.319 --> 3066.04
have to be with the devils and be

3063.76 --> 3067.8390000000004
successful whatever and be absolutely

3066.04 --> 3069.72
miserable and probably commit suicide

3067.839 --> 3071.5589999999997
very quickly because it just can't

3069.72 --> 3076.24
handle that

3071.559 --> 3079.559
[ __ ] so a way through an in between an

3076.24 --> 3082.839
experiment a spiritual

3079.559 --> 3086.119
experiment because I can because I have

3082.839 --> 3089.599
those Dynamics available internally

3086.119 --> 3092.2000000000003
to actually do that and and

3089.599 --> 3096.44
attempt a very

3092.2 --> 3099.52
unexpected path through the presented

3096.44 --> 3099.52
chaos of the

3100.44 --> 3105.16
time that's what I tried to do it's

3102.96 --> 3110.839
magical thinking in a

3105.16 --> 3113.839
way it didn't really work but it

3110.839 --> 3113.839
has

3114.359 --> 3118.64
reinforced

3116.28 --> 3122.119
the the opposition against the evil

3118.64 --> 3125.24
though in a spiritual way like it has

3122.119 --> 3128.559
has made me more certain more stable

3125.24 --> 3133.319
also doing that

3128.559 --> 3136.48
really it it disconnected my soul my

3133.319 --> 3138.96
spirit from any kind of real road that

3136.48 --> 3140.799
anybody was on like completely isolated

3138.96 --> 3143.119
myself and when you do that when you

3140.799 --> 3146.359
completely isolate yourself as an

3143.119 --> 3148.799
individual from society just completely

3146.359 --> 3151.839
well then you start to see the things

3148.799 --> 3154.44
that you can't see when you're tapped

3151.839 --> 3156.64
into it when you're in there there are

3154.44 --> 3159.119
certain things you can't see because you

3156.64 --> 3162.04
are it you're you're in it you don't see

3159.119 --> 3165.079
it you just do it when you're out of it

3162.04 --> 3167.7599999999998
when you're completely isolated you can

3165.079 --> 3170.6400000000003
suddenly see those things that you can't

3167.76 --> 3170.6400000000003
see when you're in

3170.799 --> 3174.24
it and that's something that I did get

3173.24 --> 3177.24
out of

3174.24 --> 3177.24
it

3191.119 --> 3196.76
yeah Thomas you could get the [ __ ] out

3195.16 --> 3199.24
of

3196.76 --> 3201.7200000000003
here hey roof of St hubbins I didn't

3199.24 --> 3201.72
know you were

3204.16 --> 3207.16
listening

3217.079 --> 3220.7200000000003
teacher and children [ __ ]

3225.2 --> 3231.7999999999997
you what happened to all of my mods I

3228.24 --> 3234.16
drenched them

3231.8 --> 3237.1600000000003
[Music]

3234.16 --> 3237.16
C

3253.57 --> 3256.789
[Music]

3257.76 --> 3262.7990000000004
because

3260.04 --> 3264.079
yeah the wrenches were originally just

3262.799 --> 3268.28
so that

3264.079 --> 3270.4
people could post links and all that but

3268.28 --> 3272.88
I had infiltrants that had managed to

3270.4 --> 3274.76
get a wrench that were literally like

3272.88 --> 3277.76
unbanning

3274.76 --> 3280.76
trolls and other annoying things in my

3277.76 --> 3282.48
channel so I took all the wrenches away

3280.76 --> 3283.92
except for just a couple of people that

3282.48 --> 3287.2
I was absolutely

3283.92 --> 3289.16
certain would not be the

3287.2 --> 3293.2799999999997
infiltrants and they're the ones that

3289.16 --> 3293.2799999999997
get to keep the wrenches and the rest

3294.079 --> 3297.079
don't

3300.799 --> 3306.64
what kind of a question is that W boy

3303.119 --> 3306.6400000000003
why the [ __ ] are you bringing that

3312.4 --> 3318.319
up somebody must have unbanned you then

3315.28 --> 3318.3190000000004
no I unbanned

3322.4 --> 3327.28
you banned you four years ago yeah I

3324.799 --> 3327.28
know I

3331.599 --> 3337.599
remember you got carried away by some

3334.319 --> 3340.16
hor [ __ ] back then that happens to

3337.599 --> 3344.0
people and then I ban them until that

3340.16 --> 3347.799
horse [ __ ] is over and then like the the

3344.0 --> 3349.48
delusion starts to waver the spell ends

3347.799 --> 3350.52
and then you get back to normal and then

3349.48 --> 3353.48
it's like

3350.52 --> 3355.46
yeah welcome back glad that you are

3353.48 --> 3358.559
yourself again

3355.46 --> 3358.559
[Music]

3360.8 --> 3364.0890000000004
[Music]

3364.24 --> 3369.7599999999998
try making my brother does that flat

3366.96 --> 3375.16
land hey how

3369.76 --> 3375.1600000000003
about stop giving me [ __ ] tips for

3376.0 --> 3379.48
jobs how about

3383.92 --> 3388.4
that

3385.559 --> 3391.92
yeah you want to get me tips for for

3388.4 --> 3395.799
work for income get me tips

3391.92 --> 3398.64
on on how I can improve my

3395.799 --> 3402.16
show so that I'd actually get more

3398.64 --> 3402.16
support how about

3409.119 --> 3413.1600000000003
that do you got any good

3413.88 --> 3416.88
suggestions

3423.119 --> 3429.2000000000003
content yeah I mean I don't have content

3425.52 --> 3433.119
right I only have like 10,000

3429.2 --> 3437.359
hours or something of content I don't

3433.119 --> 3437.359
have enough content truth matters

3443.799 --> 3446.799
sure

3446.96 --> 3451.68
what I think each of the four cardinal

3449.24 --> 3455.64
dire what are what the hell does that

3451.68 --> 3455.64
mean tiger bear

3458.24 --> 3462.9199999999996
what talk more about science and

3465.599 --> 3469.799
physics well then bring up science and

3468.28 --> 3473.2000000000003
physics

3469.799 --> 3476.839
[ __ ] nobody's brought it

3473.2 --> 3479.839
up if you bring it up I'll talk about it

3476.839 --> 3482.92
huh put something down I'll immediately

3479.839 --> 3484.88
identify what it is whether it's wrong

3482.92 --> 3488.2400000000002
whether it's right how it was

3484.88 --> 3491.7200000000003
constructed in your mind and why yeah I

3488.24 --> 3495.4799999999996
can do all of that I just don't talk

3491.72 --> 3498.9599999999996
about it per default because I've

3495.48 --> 3502.88
mastered it to a degree that is like

3498.96 --> 3505.64
Beyond worthwhile to normal people that

3502.88 --> 3507.599
have their sanity about them

3505.64 --> 3511.5989999999997
and when you have mastered something to

3507.599 --> 3516.079
that degree you tend to not continually

3511.599 --> 3518.96
want to do it because it bores

3516.079 --> 3521.799
you that's the price of

3518.96 --> 3524.92
Mastery you become too good at something

3521.799 --> 3527.0
it becomes boring to you right but it

3524.92 --> 3529.76
doesn't mean that I can't use it you

3527.0 --> 3531.68
just got to bring it up you bring it up

3529.76 --> 3535.44
you bring up a Ballard claim you bring

3531.68 --> 3538.2799999999997
up a flat Earth question whatever

3535.44 --> 3539.88
and you know I can deal with that you

3538.28 --> 3543.119
know

3539.88 --> 3546.76
it and I'm not just going to per default

3543.119 --> 3548.6800000000003
like just oh let's talk about science oh

3546.76 --> 3551.7990000000004
just let's talk about the scientific

3548.68 --> 3554.839
method I'm sure you guys want to hear

3551.799 --> 3557.0
more explanation about the scientific

3554.839 --> 3559.319
method it's it's not

3557.0 --> 3561.48
like you're all going to throw up

3559.319 --> 3563.24
immediately if I even say that word at

3561.48 --> 3565.839
this

3563.24 --> 3568.24
point right is that what you

3565.839 --> 3570.599
want I mean there's plenty of that at

3568.24 --> 3572.4799999999996
the Flat Earth debates right and that's

3570.599 --> 3574.92
why it's the Flat Earth

3572.48 --> 3578.4
debates that's what you do there that's

3574.92 --> 3582.44
what I do there and I abide to that

3578.4 --> 3583.96
there over here I'd like to have a

3582.44 --> 3587.7200000000003
little bit more

3583.96 --> 3587.7200000000003
room if you know what I

3590.63 --> 3597.2000000000003
[Music]

3593.64 --> 3600.0389999999998
mean can you ask a question about air

3597.2 --> 3602.2799999999997
pressure yeah sure why not why wouldn't

3600.039 --> 3606.44
you be able to ask a question about air

3602.28 --> 3608.76
pressure gas pressure to be specific air

3606.44 --> 3612.119
pressure it's not really the right

3608.76 --> 3612.119
description if we're talking

3614.079 --> 3619.48
physics no borders boy no

3620.039 --> 3626.559
opinion my opinion is you have a problem

3622.68 --> 3626.5589999999997
with it you deal with it

3626.98 --> 3638.289
[Music]

3642.559 --> 3648.4
yeah can I explain why the air pressure

3645.68 --> 3652.2
at the top of M A is less than at the

3648.4 --> 3655.1600000000003
base and it's not equal yes absolutely I

3652.2 --> 3656.799
can yeah it's because of of the

3655.16 --> 3659.799
temperature

3656.799 --> 3664.64
differential the amount of temperature

3659.799 --> 3667.2
heat that is at the ground level is much

3664.64 --> 3670.48
higher now you can argue that's because

3667.2 --> 3672.3999999999996
of the sun because the temperature like

3670.48 --> 3673.88
can't escape there as easily because

3672.4 --> 3676.4
it's more

3673.88 --> 3678.88
compressed it's a bit complicated but

3676.4 --> 3681.2000000000003
whatever it is it it must be because

3678.88 --> 3683.319
it's the only thing that we have tested

3681.2 --> 3686.16
to do something like that it must be a

3683.319 --> 3689.0389999999998
temperature differential that's causing

3686.16 --> 3692.799
it cuz at the ground level is where all

3689.039 --> 3696.039
the heat is at in the dynamic system of

3692.799 --> 3698.2
our realm well at the top we don't even

3696.039 --> 3700.039
know where the top really is but we know

3698.2 --> 3703.4399999999996
that there's very little surface there

3700.039 --> 3705.88
that has heat and so there would have to

3703.44 --> 3705.88
be

3706.48 --> 3711.039
a don't know you are but go [ __ ]

3711.599 --> 3718.92
yourself that would have to be a cold

3715.039 --> 3723.2000000000003
influx up there it's cold it's provably

3718.92 --> 3724.96
cold down here provably warmer warmer

3723.2 --> 3727.96
than it is up there and

3724.96 --> 3731.4
thus it's proven that in any closed

3727.96 --> 3733.68
system if you have gas and you allow on

3731.4 --> 3736.7200000000003
one side to have heat influx and on the

3733.68 --> 3740.48
other side cold influx that the gas

3736.72 --> 3743.5989999999997
within that closed system will form a

3740.48 --> 3746.2
gradient where at the cold side the

3743.599 --> 3750.92
pressure will be lower than at the hot

3746.2 --> 3753.359
side exactly as we experience it here on

3750.92 --> 3755.88
Earth and so that's

3753.359 --> 3758.88
why does that answer your

3755.88 --> 3758.88
question

3759.55 --> 3766.079
[Music]

3763.76 --> 3767.96
should I thought high pressure canot

3766.079 --> 3770.88
exist next to low pressure yeah it's not

3767.96 --> 3774.96
that much of a difference and it can

3770.88 --> 3777.079
exist it just can't exist at a certain

3774.96 --> 3780.0
scale

3777.079 --> 3781.8390000000004
yeah you can have slightly lower

3780.0 --> 3783.64
pressure next to slightly higher

3781.839 --> 3785.319
pressure that's that's definitely

3783.64 --> 3786.44
possible I just explain how that works

3785.319 --> 3790.88
through

3786.44 --> 3794.039
temperature insert influx that does

3790.88 --> 3797.599
that right what it doesn't do however is

3794.039 --> 3800.079
extr extrem FY the contrast between the

3797.599 --> 3803.48
low pressure and higher pressure to a

3800.079 --> 3806.319
degree where it's like complete nothing

3803.48 --> 3809.2
right next to complete everything that's

3806.319 --> 3809.2
something that doesn't

3816.4 --> 3822.839
happen doesn't hair rot hair hot air

3819.68 --> 3828.1189999999997
rise yeah so it's a dynamic system it's

3822.839 --> 3831.0
all moving yeah the the gradient of gas

3828.119 --> 3835.039
pressure does not mean that it's just

3831.0 --> 3838.039
sitting still there at that density no

3835.039 --> 3840.76
no it's like that because the whole

3838.039 --> 3845.279
thing is moving

3840.76 --> 3848.88
continually the gradiation is a result

3845.279 --> 3852.16
of how it's moving you

3848.88 --> 3854.76
see it's not sitting still nothing about

3852.16 --> 3856.5589999999997
this air is sitting still ever it's

3854.76 --> 3859.3590000000004
always

3856.559 --> 3862.8390000000004
moving it's just that the

3859.359 --> 3865.44
way the temperature influences

3862.839 --> 3869.0389999999998
are inser in

3865.44 --> 3871.76
themselves it causes that movement

3869.039 --> 3874.079
Dynamic that results in the gas pressure

3871.76 --> 3876.7990000000004
gradient in a pressure differential

3874.079 --> 3876.799
within the same

3879.0 --> 3884.359
system then why can space exist because

3881.799 --> 3887.96
it's too big a volume with too low a

3884.359 --> 3890.24
pressure and that could never gradiate a

3887.96 --> 3893.16
volume like that can never gradiate out

3890.24 --> 3896.799
to what we got here that's

3893.16 --> 3896.799
why it's very

3897.559 --> 3904.6800000000003
simple T do you get that gas pressure

3902.599 --> 3909.52
can't gradiate like

3904.68 --> 3912.359
that can't have a super thick layer of

3909.52 --> 3913.88
gas and then like oh gradients out it

3912.359 --> 3917.319
gets thinner and thinner and thinner and

3913.88 --> 3920.76
then we have a 100 billion times more

3917.319 --> 3924.24
volume with absolutely nothing yeah yeah

3920.76 --> 3927.3190000000004
that is absolutely impossible there is

3924.24 --> 3929.16
is no simulation that can even be

3927.319 --> 3933.279
conceived of

3929.16 --> 3935.72
digitally that would yield such a result

3933.279 --> 3938.92
ever it's absolutely impossible

3935.72 --> 3940.9199999999996
gradiation does not work out like that

3938.92 --> 3944.079
gradiation is always with in a closed

3940.92 --> 3946.88
system and is a slight differential it's

3944.079 --> 3950.279
never that extreme that's impossible

3946.88 --> 3955.1600000000003
cannot even be simulated to do

3950.279 --> 3960.16
that ingredients cannot

3955.16 --> 3963.48
so is that what is the altitude I don't

3960.16 --> 3965.5989999999997
know it's not

3963.48 --> 3968.799
relevant the point

3965.599 --> 3972.1600000000003
is only the entire containment can

3968.799 --> 3972.16
gradiate as a

3975.359 --> 3980.7599999999998
hole and because of the way that it's

3977.839 --> 3986.0
grating well it's not going to be a 100

3980.76 --> 3986.0
billion miles high it's very

3991.839 --> 3999.319
simple just look at how the pressure

3994.64 --> 4001.2
gradient is and then you could infer

3999.319 --> 4004.44
derive

4001.2 --> 4008.24
logically uh an average point where the

4004.44 --> 4010.88
container wall should be on on top of it

4008.24 --> 4013.72
based on how the gas is

4010.88 --> 4016.44
gradiated you wouldn't even need to know

4013.72 --> 4018.0789999999997
the temperature differentials you didn't

4016.44 --> 4020.96
even need to know how that works you

4018.079 --> 4024.1600000000003
could just measure the pressure gradient

4020.96 --> 4027.359
and thereby follow the pattern

4024.16 --> 4029.68
logically and then through inference

4027.359 --> 4032.839
figure out where roughly the barrier

4029.68 --> 4037.0789999999997
should be and it's not going to be 100

4032.839 --> 4037.0789999999997
billion miles away I could tell you that

4039.96 --> 4045.92
[Music]

4042.92 --> 4045.92
yeah

4045.95 --> 4050.3999999999996
[Music]

4048.16 --> 4052.7599999999998
so why do you keep asking me this hor

4050.4 --> 4052.76
[ __ ]

4052.92 --> 4058.6800000000003
questions I'm telling you I'm not

4056.44 --> 4061.4
calculating it for you yeah I don't

4058.68 --> 4065.0789999999997
calculate things I'm telling you how it

4061.4 --> 4067.64
works how you could calculate it I don't

4065.079 --> 4067.6400000000003
calculate

4067.68 --> 4071.319
it I'm not even

4072.559 --> 4078.2400000000002
interested just trying to point at you

4075.96 --> 4081.92
that the gradient is going to be divided

4078.24 --> 4086.279
in a certain way a certain

4081.92 --> 4090.4
ratio and it's not going to be a 100

4086.279 --> 4093.599
billion miles of empty volume next to

4090.4 --> 4095.839
this kind of gas pressure gradient it's

4093.599 --> 4095.839
very

4095.96 --> 4101.359
simple that's all that I need to know

4099.159 --> 4106.12
you need to know more well you go do the

4101.359 --> 4106.120000000001
test then you go figure it

4109.859 --> 4117.88
[Music]

4113.12 --> 4121.759
out do bumblebees change their density

4117.88 --> 4126.88
no no duper bumblebees I think they use

4121.759 --> 4126.88
a very Advanced specific type of

4126.92 --> 4132.52
turbulence they's sort of like I think

4130.48 --> 4134.639999999999
they're like creating like a

4132.52 --> 4136.6
vacuum bubble

4134.64 --> 4139.4800000000005
it's very unique what they do

4136.6 --> 4142.319
Toons it doesn't have anything directly

4139.48 --> 4142.3189999999995
to do with the

4150.44 --> 4154.919999999999
density yeah well AJ Tre there's

4152.799 --> 4157.6
probably people that are doing it out

4154.92 --> 4161.2390000000005
there and hey you want to do it go and

4157.6 --> 4163.839
do it I told you you could probably

4161.239 --> 4166.599999999999
infer it if you're like really a master

4163.839 --> 4169.679
of like knowing how gas pressure

4166.6 --> 4172.759
gradients manifest exactly and how that

4169.679 --> 4175.0
works in scale if you can figure out at

4172.759 --> 4176.56
a very small scale how gas gradates and

4175.0 --> 4178.52
then you take it larger scale then you

4176.56 --> 4180.2390000000005
see how it gradates and even larger

4178.52 --> 4183.359
scale how it gradiate and you keep

4180.239 --> 4186.0
scaling it up then eventually you'll

4183.359 --> 4189.4400000000005
start to see a very distinct pattern in

4186.0 --> 4192.0
how the gas gradates and then eventually

4189.44 --> 4194.32
you could be like yeah I think I've I've

4192.0 --> 4197.0
gone to the big enough skill

4194.32 --> 4201.28
to now draw this final conclusion about

4197.0 --> 4204.48
how gas gradi yet the higher the scale

4201.28 --> 4207.719
is and that will get you stuck at a

4204.48 --> 4210.12
certain height that's what I can predict

4207.719 --> 4211.6
yeah without actually doing it that's

4210.12 --> 4214.08
what I can predict that's what would

4211.6 --> 4216.4400000000005
happen if you even give a [ __ ] or if

4214.08 --> 4219.5199999999995
you're just here to just break down

4216.44 --> 4222.48
whatever Arwin is saying yeah because

4219.52 --> 4226.400000000001
I'm not going to do it I don't need to

4222.48 --> 4226.4
do it to make my argument as a flat

4226.52 --> 4235.4400000000005
earther I'm just giving you extra

4231.92 --> 4237.88
data that I don't need to give you to

4235.44 --> 4240.719
make my argument as a flat earther but

4237.88 --> 4243.2390000000005
I'm still doing it anyway so that

4240.719 --> 4246.159
hopefully in your mind it can make a

4243.239 --> 4246.159
little bit more

4247.88 --> 4251.92
sense okay bord boy see you

4252.64 --> 4255.64
later

4257.64 --> 4265.08
no gradiation never goes on forever AJ

4262.44 --> 4268.4
track that's literally

4265.08 --> 4270.88
impossible that's then you don't

4268.4 --> 4273.0
understand what gradiation is if you

4270.88 --> 4274.92
claim that gradiation can go on forever

4273.0 --> 4278.44
then you literally do not understand

4274.92 --> 4282.56
what gradiation is cu it can't go on

4278.44 --> 4285.5599999999995
forever that's the whole [ __ ]

4282.56 --> 4285.56
point

4292.52 --> 4298.0
hello Tommy it's not that confusing at

4295.56 --> 4300.88
all Tommy don't worry about it and it's

4298.0 --> 4300.88
not funny

4302.4 --> 4307.599999999999
stuff I think you were wrong on this oh

4305.4 --> 4312.28
based on what HH

4307.6 --> 4314.400000000001
tag what we disagree [ __ ] you [ __ ] you

4312.28 --> 4316.4
with your agreed to disagree ree people

4314.4 --> 4319.879999999999
that tell me agree to disagree that's

4316.4 --> 4321.44
usually people I kick the [ __ ] out I

4319.88 --> 4325.76
hate I

4321.44 --> 4329.839999999999
despise people that say that yeah I

4325.76 --> 4329.84
never agree to disagree

4331.36 --> 4337.32
ever you hear

4334.0 --> 4342.48
me you tell me I'm wrong you [ __ ]

4337.32 --> 4345.48
back that you back that hor

4342.48 --> 4345.48
[ __ ]

4347.44 --> 4352.5599999999995
you gave me a donation oh you did I

4350.0 --> 4352.56
didn't know

4352.719 --> 4356.92
that doesn't matter though it doesn't

4355.12 --> 4359.4
matter for the actual argumentation what

4356.92 --> 4363.159
you think you can get some lean

4359.4 --> 4364.638999999999
way in your argument you didn't give me

4363.159 --> 4367.199
anything by the way what the [ __ ] are

4364.639 --> 4367.1990000000005
you talking

4369.8 --> 4374.76
about talking to me like

4372.44 --> 4376.36
that

4374.76 --> 4378.52
what the [ __ ] are you talking about you

4376.36 --> 4382.4
didn't give me

4378.52 --> 4382.400000000001
anything there's nothing

4385.92 --> 4391.36
there oh a

4387.8 --> 4393.8
membership oh great yeah that's not

4391.36 --> 4399.599999999999
really cool

4393.8 --> 4402.4800000000005
yeah that's cool that's I turn it

4399.6 --> 4404.04
off because I don't get anything out of

4402.48 --> 4407.799999999999
that

4404.04 --> 4407.8
tried to explain that

4408.08 --> 4413.159
before I mean it's cool and all that

4410.6 --> 4415.360000000001
it's like cute I don't actually get

4413.159 --> 4417.12
anything out of it I only get anything

4415.36 --> 4419.639
out of a PayPal

4417.12 --> 4422.8
donation like that's the only thing I

4419.639 --> 4422.8
actually get anything out

4422.92 --> 4427.4800000000005
of so but that's

4428.679 --> 4433.719
cool right but I mean you don't have an

4431.6 --> 4436.4800000000005
explanation though an alternative

4433.719 --> 4439.04
explanation for the gradient as it is

4436.48 --> 4442.839999999999
manifested you haven't backed up

4439.04 --> 4445.08
anything that you said in a supposed

4442.84 --> 4447.92
reot to everything that I've explained

4445.08 --> 4449.92
about it so you want to actually make an

4447.92 --> 4452.88
attempt to make some sense now within

4449.92 --> 4457.6
this argument AJ

4452.88 --> 4457.6
Tre certainly curious to see if you

4457.78 --> 4465.28
[Music]

4462.28 --> 4465.28
can

4466.4 --> 4470.4
you want to make attempt oh go ahead

4471.159 --> 4475.4
then no Air does not have

4476.04 --> 4481.6
weight air moves in all directions it's

4479.159 --> 4484.239
continually moving it does not go down

4481.6 --> 4486.4800000000005
go boom boom there's no Vector involved

4484.239 --> 4486.48
with

4491.8 --> 4498.360000000001
air that's right Air does not have

4494.4 --> 4501.239
weight because weight is a

4498.36 --> 4506.159
convention that is based

4501.239 --> 4508.638999999999
of the dis equilibrium pressure in of an

4506.159 --> 4513.239
object in relation to the medium it is

4508.639 --> 4516.96
in of air in its expanded state so guess

4513.239 --> 4520.759999999999
what air in its expanded State offset

4516.96 --> 4523.8
with air in its expanded state is zero

4520.76 --> 4527.2390000000005
result there is literally no weight

4523.8 --> 4530.6
possible because the weight is measured

4527.239 --> 4533.799999999999
through an offset of air in its expanded

4530.6 --> 4537.2390000000005
state so there's literally no possible

4533.8 --> 4539.52
way to measure the weight of air in its

4537.239 --> 4542.959999999999
expanded State it's literally impossible

4539.52 --> 4542.96
the result will always be

4543.199 --> 4551.159
zero because the convention of weight is

4546.36 --> 4551.159
set in air in its expanded

4551.96 --> 4556.92
state so so yes air doesn't weigh

4554.679 --> 4559.36
anything you can compress it and then

4556.92 --> 4560.96
suddenly it starts to weigh something

4559.36 --> 4561.839999999999
because you put it and compressed it in

4560.96 --> 4565.4
a

4561.84 --> 4567.719
container sure but in its expanded state

4565.4 --> 4571.0
it doesn't weigh anything because it's

4567.719 --> 4573.76
literally a zero differential rate with

4571.0 --> 4573.76
the medium it is

4577.09 --> 4582.0

4585.32 --> 4591.599999999999
does that have to do with anything it's

4587.12 --> 4591.599999999999
not funny scuba tank fallacy

4592.32 --> 4596.44
[ __ ] you don't have to compress it

4594.8 --> 4598.56
yeah well if you don't compress it it's

4596.44 --> 4601.48
not going to create a differential now

4598.56 --> 4601.4800000000005
is it Kumo

virus

4614.27 --> 4617.419000000001
[Music]

4620.28 --> 4627.88
so that confinement prevacuum

4623.44 --> 4631.44
weight same as post vacuum

4627.88 --> 4635.52
no weight is a

4631.44 --> 4637.159
convention weight is not a physics

4635.52 --> 4640.040000000001
inherent

4637.159 --> 4644.759999999999
trait you

4640.04 --> 4646.6
understand not physics in parent trait

4644.76 --> 4648.280000000001
is a

4646.6 --> 4650.159000000001
convention

4648.28 --> 4654.12
derived

4650.159 --> 4657.239
concept it's a convention

4654.12 --> 4659.96
created by taking the

4657.239 --> 4662.799999999999
ratio this equilibrium

4659.96 --> 4666.36
ratio right density is equilibrium ratio

4662.8 --> 4669.6
between the object and the medium if the

4666.36 --> 4672.5599999999995
object density ratio is exactly

4669.6 --> 4674.679
identical to that of the medium then

4672.56 --> 4677.88
there is no differential and then there

4674.679 --> 4681.28
is and cannot ever be

4677.88 --> 4684.32
weight gas in its expanded State cannot

4681.28 --> 4687.12
have weight because you would have to

4684.32 --> 4689.44
weigh it in itself which would always

4687.12 --> 4692.44
yield a zero

4689.44 --> 4692.44
differential

4693.94 --> 4697.79
[Music]

4701.92 --> 4704.92
result

4706.28 --> 4709.84
box what box this

4710.159 --> 4717.96
box a pure oxygen uh I think pure oxygen

4714.4 --> 4719.92
is a little bit more dense than the

4717.96 --> 4722.32
average

4719.92 --> 4724.12
air so yeah then there will be a slight

4722.32 --> 4726.12
differential but only as long as it is

4724.12 --> 4730.28
retained in that box because of course

4726.12 --> 4730.28
it will spread out and mix it with

4730.36 --> 4734.36
everything right as soon as you're

4732.52 --> 4737.0
talking about air which is the

4734.36 --> 4739.5199999999995
inhomogeneous mesh of all the

4737.0 --> 4741.44
gases then there will be zero

4739.52 --> 4744.92
differential

4741.44 --> 4747.199
result zero when you try to weigh it

4744.92 --> 4749.6
because you're literally trying to weigh

4747.199 --> 4751.96
the differential with itself but if you

4749.6 --> 4755.6
take an isolated type of gas that's

4751.96 --> 4758.88
refined yeah there might be a little bit

4755.6 --> 4761.2390000000005
weight differential it's not going to be

4758.88 --> 4763.32
in comption to like the atomic weight

4761.239 --> 4765.638999999999
though but yeah there will be some dise

4763.32 --> 4768.599999999999
equilibrium because I mean the density

4765.639 --> 4771.8
average will be slightly bigger or lower

4768.6 --> 4774.400000000001
than that of air even in its expanded

4771.8 --> 4776.0
state but you'd have to isolate it

4774.4 --> 4777.599999999999
though you have to completely contain it

4776.0 --> 4779.639
or it's not going to persist it's going

4777.6 --> 4781.280000000001
to just mix in with everything

4779.639 --> 4785.92
else

4781.28 --> 4785.92
so TR a is more dense okay

4787.92 --> 4794.4

though it's never been proven it's never

4858.28 --> 4865.84
even been claimed to be a real

4860.6 --> 4865.84
thing yeah Air does not have

4866.04 --> 4873.76
weight weight is a convention

4869.6 --> 4877.76
mass is a concept based on the

weight

4943.99 --> 4947.1089999999995
[Music]

4947.76 --> 4950.92
mass and weight are

4951.84 --> 4956.0
conventions relative density dis

4954.32 --> 4960.84
equilibrium

4956.0 --> 4962.48
pressure within a medium of air in its

4960.84 --> 4966.0
expanded

4962.48 --> 4970.159
State that's what weight is as a real

4966.0 --> 4970.159
thing and that's what mass is derived

4971.56 --> 4978.2390000000005
from

4973.44 --> 4978.239
not a physics inherent

4982.44 --> 4987.919999999999
ability because any of these influences

4985.52 --> 4990.040000000001
purely dependent on

4987.92 --> 4993.04
what it is

4990.04 --> 4993.04
in

4993.36 --> 4999.5199999999995
yeah that's the

4995.52 --> 5002.92
thing weight is simply air weight but

4999.52 --> 5005.320000000001
what do you if you weigh that same stuff

5002.92 --> 5007.159
in water yeah it's called water weight

5005.32 --> 5011.639
yeah oh oh wait it's completely

5007.159 --> 5015.638999999999
different now yeah try to weigh that air

5011.639 --> 5018.76
in water oh oh you get anti- weight that

5015.639 --> 5022.0
makes sense that sounds like physics

5018.76 --> 5024.76
right anti- weight that's so physics I

5022.0 --> 5027.28
mean it's not like oh maybe it's not

5024.76 --> 5029.280000000001
Material inherent because there is

5027.28 --> 5032.199
nothing that's actually

5029.28 --> 5034.4
negative physically physics doesn't have

5032.199 --> 5036.719
Act ual negative things you see that's

5034.4 --> 5040.08
not how physics works at all that only

5036.719 --> 5044.8
happens in math in math you can have

5040.08 --> 5047.159
negative things yeah like math subjected

5044.8 --> 5051.0
to

5047.159 --> 5053.92
conventions not physics inherent

5051.0 --> 5057.639
abilities yeah because weight isn't

5053.92 --> 5060.76
physics inherent it's a convention based

5057.639 --> 5063.56
measuring tool and the normal weight

5060.76 --> 5065.4800000000005
that we know is air weight but if you

5063.56 --> 5068.88
take the same object and then you weigh

5065.48 --> 5072.799999999999
it in water called water weight oh guess

5068.88 --> 5074.52
what oh yeah now the density

5072.8 --> 5078.159000000001
differential is much

5074.52 --> 5081.400000000001
bigger so if it's very low density it's

5078.159 --> 5083.48
going to want to go up very hard instead

5081.4 --> 5086.5599999999995
of just floating around like when you

5083.48 --> 5088.799999999999
try to weigh it in air

5086.56 --> 5090.8
right and now you can turn it around now

5088.8 --> 5093.360000000001
you can do a vacuum weigh yeah you can

5090.8 --> 5096.28
weigh that air in a vacuum oh wow it

5093.36 --> 5099.119
goes down all of a sudden why well

5096.28 --> 5100.5599999999995
because you have to put it in a balloon

5099.119 --> 5101.96
or something that's hard enough to

5100.56 --> 5106.2390000000005
withstand the

5101.96 --> 5110.119
vacuum but yeah a vacuum is a lower

5106.239 --> 5112.959999999999
density than gas even in its expanded

5110.119 --> 5115.04
state so yeah now the differential is

5112.96 --> 5118.0
there now it's actually going to go down

5115.04 --> 5120.239
why because a vacuum is a lower density

5118.0 --> 5122.88
but hey if you take that same balloon in

5120.239 --> 5125.48
water it's going to go up

5122.88 --> 5129.679
CU it's higher it's lower density than

5125.48 --> 5134.48
the water see so that's what weight is

5129.679 --> 5134.4800000000005
it's just relative density dis

5134.56 --> 5141.280000000001
equilibrium that happens in a

5138.56 --> 5143.92
state in a medium of

5141.28 --> 5146.36
air that's what that is it's not

5143.92 --> 5149.2390000000005
Material inherit you surround the same

5146.36 --> 5151.599999999999
material by another material and it

5149.239 --> 5155.759999999999
doesn't go the same direction and it

5151.6 --> 5159.280000000001
doesn't press as much in that same

5155.76 --> 5163.360000000001
direction so whatever it's going to be

5159.28 --> 5166.08
doing moving up moving down it all

5163.36 --> 5167.639
depends on the medium so it's

5166.08 --> 5171.199
not

5167.639 --> 5175.4400000000005
Material inherent it doesn't always do

5171.199 --> 5178.799999999999
the same thing at all times it's

5175.44 --> 5181.04
conditional dependent on the medium it

5178.8 --> 5181.04
is

5181.199 --> 5184.199
in

5189.239 --> 5193.44
yeah Mass doesn't even exist without

5194.81 --> 5200.679
[Music]

5197.56 --> 5203.400000000001
weight somebody get qwi in here this is

5200.679 --> 5203.4
getting really

5211.199 --> 5214.199
annoying

5215.199 --> 5219.5599999999995
is the density of matter inherent

5222.56 --> 5228.679
yes all matter has a density at all

5238.04 --> 5245.36
times now you can't always measure the

5241.48 --> 5248.119
density properly or easily but it is

5245.36 --> 5251.0
absolutely certain that all matter has a

5248.119 --> 5251.0
density at all

5251.639 --> 5256.6
time that's right mass is not inherent

5254.44 --> 5258.199
and density is that's correct because

5256.6 --> 5263.08
mass is

5258.199 --> 5266.5199999999995
merely a convention derived

5263.08 --> 5270.48
concept yeah derived from weight

5266.52 --> 5272.8
mathematically well density is material

5270.48 --> 5275.4
inherent that means the material

5272.8 --> 5277.719
always has it at all times no matter

5275.4 --> 5281.28
what happens to it or the surrounding it

5277.719 --> 5283.6
is in it always has the density and that

5281.28 --> 5283.599999999999
never

5283.639 --> 5289.08
changes yeah well weight is merely a

5287.04 --> 5292.56
derived little

5289.08 --> 5296.08
trick a a a reading derived from a

5292.56 --> 5299.159000000001
specific action that is very conditional

5296.08 --> 5302.28
it's not absolute it's dependent on the

5299.159 --> 5305.759999999999
conditions of what you need to to

5302.28 --> 5305.759999999999
establish weight in

5308.239 --> 5312.5599999999995
air are you getting wisdom good to see

5316.17 --> 5319.34
[Music]

5330.44 --> 5336.759999999999
you yeah you guys know the

5334.44 --> 5339.0
drill what you think this is the first

5336.76 --> 5341.56
time I'm like explaining this kind of

5339.0 --> 5343.639
thing I had entire shows dedicated to

5341.56 --> 5347.56
this

5343.639 --> 5350.119
[ __ ] I've had like 10 shows that have

5347.56 --> 5353.96
like gas doesn't have mass in the title

5350.119 --> 5353.96
in the last four or five

5355.199 --> 5359.159
years it's just people don't want to get

5357.56 --> 5360.1990000000005
it they just don't want to get it they

5359.159 --> 5364.199
just keep

5360.199 --> 5367.36
on mess but it has mass and mass is like

5364.199 --> 5371.16
eal mc² and that means

5367.36 --> 5371.16
[Music]

5374.76 --> 5380.96
gravity or one of the other freaking

5377.119 --> 5385.44
formulas I don't care it's just uh

5380.96 --> 5385.44
gravity Mass yeah no

5386.119 --> 5392.119
no mass is merely a derived concept from

5389.56 --> 5395.92
a Convention of weight it doesn't

5392.119 --> 5398.679
actually exist and it's definitely not

5395.92 --> 5398.679
Material

5405.28 --> 5411.599999999999
inherent yeah yeah I can AJ trick yeah

5408.4 --> 5414.799999999999
you see because the density is always

5411.6 --> 5419.88
there but the

5414.8 --> 5423.96
mass it's merely an extraction an

5419.88 --> 5426.8
idea that is derived from

5423.96 --> 5429.679
theity you can think of it as being

5426.8 --> 5433.0
there but it's not Material inherent

5429.679 --> 5435.8
because you'd have to isolate it and

5433.0 --> 5438.52
ignore the other

5435.8 --> 5441.119000000001
Factor do a little mathematical juggle

5438.52 --> 5443.719
with it and then come to that result but

5441.119 --> 5446.28
density is always there everything has a

5443.719 --> 5449.08
density at all

5446.28 --> 5452.0
time and there's a direct way to figure

5449.08 --> 5455.679
out the density you compare it with with

5452.0 --> 5455.679
another density and you will see

5456.44 --> 5462.799999999999
immediately yeah weight

5460.199 --> 5466.759999999999
nope because weight is directly

5462.8 --> 5470.119000000001
dependent on the medium it is in to be

5466.76 --> 5472.360000000001
able to establish it density you don't

5470.119 --> 5475.48
need to know the freaking medium you

5472.36 --> 5478.119
don't need to know anything you just

5475.48 --> 5480.879999999999
compare it with something else and then

5478.119 --> 5482.679
you know what what is more dense you

5480.88 --> 5484.28
don't have a reading a weight yeah when

5482.679 --> 5487.119
you compare two

5484.28 --> 5490.96
rocks you think you're comparing

5487.119 --> 5493.599999999999
weight you're comparing the

5490.96 --> 5495.639
density

5493.6 --> 5498.6
yeah or or

5495.639 --> 5500.32
you well you might think oh this is the

5498.6 --> 5501.76
weight well yeah you're doing it in air

5500.32 --> 5505.04
right well how about you do it in the

5501.76 --> 5508.1990000000005
water Now is it going to feel the same

5505.04 --> 5509.5199999999995
same weight no no because you're just

5508.199 --> 5513.36
comparing the

5509.52 --> 5516.1990000000005
density within the medium of water

5513.36 --> 5518.04
its effective weight the pressure of the

5516.199 --> 5519.5599999999995
dise equilibrium with the medium is

5518.04 --> 5523.88
going to be

5519.56 --> 5527.0
different so the weight has changed yeah

5523.88 --> 5529.84
because weight is merely a convention

5527.0 --> 5529.84
derived

5534.04 --> 5540.679
concept it's not Material

5538.16 --> 5542.68
[Music]

5540.679 --> 5544.92
inherent

5542.68 --> 5546.92
[Music]

5544.92 --> 5548.84
yeah maybe if you just put your own name

5546.92 --> 5550.719
in your own comments maybe you could

5548.84 --> 5555.76
address yourself with your own

5550.719 --> 5555.76
repetitive hor [ __ ] sometime more AJ

5559.0 --> 5563.06
[Music]

5565.36 --> 5573.639
[Music]

5570.639 --> 5573.639
tag

5583.76 --> 5589.1990000000005
so it's just yeah you're probably the

5586.52 --> 5592.0
same [ __ ] guy as last time it's just

5589.199 --> 5594.159
you again it's [ __ ] [ __ ] obsessed

5592.0 --> 5598.159
with [ __ ] Mass

5594.159 --> 5600.5599999999995
again just can't let it go it's just a

5598.159 --> 5602.28
stupid little

5600.56 --> 5605.96
concept

5602.28 --> 5608.679
yeah your mass is a stupid little

5605.96 --> 5612.28
concept it's

5608.679 --> 5612.28
insignificant it is

5612.84 --> 5620.76
Superfluous there is no function for

5616.88 --> 5624.96
freaking Mass the only function it ever

5620.76 --> 5628.679
was thought to have was in Newtonian

5624.96 --> 5633.4
physics which Newton himself officially

5628.679 --> 5636.96
disclaimed to be true to be real

5633.4 --> 5637.96
yeah he did not claim a hypothesis for

5636.96 --> 5641.0
his

5637.96 --> 5643.04
gravitation officially on paper yeah

5641.0 --> 5648.8
that was the only thing that you could

5643.04 --> 5648.8
think mass of being really relevant in

5649.52 --> 5657.4400000000005
that so shut the [ __ ] up just shut the

5655.719 --> 5663.4800000000005
[ __ ] up

5657.44 --> 5663.48
man just shut the [ __ ] up

5665.61 --> 5670.44
[Music]

5667.48 --> 5670.44
and let

5686.92 --> 5690.039
[Music]

5690.48 --> 5693.48
yammering

5720.4 --> 5723.4
oh

5738.52 --> 5745.040000000001
yeah could you just stop bickering

5742.48 --> 5747.32
please yeah this is not a green light

5745.04 --> 5750.56
that bicker this is the [ __ ] reason I

5747.32 --> 5753.44
avoid Flat Earth crap cuz people just

5750.56 --> 5756.159000000001
end up endlessly bickering and the only

5753.44 --> 5760.919999999999
thing I want to do is get a stick and

5756.159 --> 5760.92
start beating you all with it

5762.44 --> 5770.08
yeah that's my new favorite thing to say

5766.32 --> 5770.08
just makes me want to beat you with a

5771.28 --> 5778.599999999999
stick I want to order one of those

5774.36 --> 5781.88
Indian Riot cop sticks just for

5778.6 --> 5785.56
that so I can show you the stick when I

5781.88 --> 5785.56
tell you that I want to beat you with

5799.159 --> 5805.239
it this is endless bickering it just

5802.6 --> 5805.2390000000005
drives me

5805.48 --> 5812.4
nuts I made my case very

5809.08 --> 5814.48
clearly I don't want to just endlessly

5812.4 --> 5818.119
bicker on with somebody that just

5814.48 --> 5820.44
refuses to listen to the points that I'm

5818.119 --> 5824.5199999999995
making just goes butt butd butd butd

5820.44 --> 5824.5199999999995
butt yeah yeah keep your butt out of my

5825.44 --> 5831.638999999999
face there is no

5827.8 --> 5834.92
butt it is what it is it's not real it's

5831.639 --> 5836.92
not Material inherent it's not

5834.92 --> 5839.32
physics yeah

5836.92 --> 5842.1990000000005
Mass it's not

5839.32 --> 5846.5199999999995
physics you could think of atomic mass

5842.199 --> 5852.759999999999
is being chem chemical chemistry

5846.52 --> 5852.76
right but mass is not physics is

5868.32 --> 5873.599
it yeah it's neonian mechanics that's

5870.84 --> 5876.679
where you get get Mass that's right

5873.599 --> 5879.1990000000005
that's [ __ ] right AJ track you

5876.679 --> 5882.36
screenshot that print that out and have

5879.199 --> 5886.159
that tattooed on your [ __ ] forehead

5882.36 --> 5889.839999999999
yeah CU it isn't Mass isn't

5886.159 --> 5893.759999999999
physics mass at best is Newtonian

5889.84 --> 5896.639
mechanics which is officially disclaimed

5893.76 --> 5901.280000000001
as being physics or scientific which is

5896.639 --> 5904.400000000001
arguably the same thing yeah so mass is

5901.28 --> 5906.8
indeed not

5904.4 --> 5908.28
physics what you're going to ask another

5906.8 --> 5910.96
question you think that's going to fix

5908.28 --> 5913.28
it you just want to get kicked out do

5910.96 --> 5918.159
you gonna you're going to start the

5913.28 --> 5918.159
stupid little Dosey Do roundabout

5919.08 --> 5927.4
again you cannot answer y oh I can

5922.639 --> 5930.119
answer oh it's called get the [ __ ] out

5927.4 --> 5932.5199999999995
you [ __ ]

5930.119 --> 5937.199

5932.52 --> 5940.599
called get the [ __ ] out you're gone you

5960.76 --> 5964.639
do that one more time I'm kicking you

5979.96 --> 5986.84
out is that clear tiger

5983.119 --> 5989.839999999999
bear retract your message one more time

5986.84 --> 5989.84
and I'm kicking you

5990.04 --> 5993.04
out

6014.82 --> 6018.24
[Music]

6019.96 --> 6022.96
good

6023.48 --> 6027.839999999999
waight is always around just waiting

6025.639 --> 6027.84
that's

6049.679 --> 6054.08
hilarious you if you compress the air

6052.199 --> 6057.36
where does the weight come

6054.08 --> 6060.84
from it literally manifests out of

6057.36 --> 6062.5199999999995
nothing flat land that's what happens

6060.84 --> 6065.92
yeah you compress

6062.52 --> 6068.8
air it gains weight yeah that's right

6065.92 --> 6071.4800000000005
out of absolutely nothing that weight

6068.8 --> 6075.719
wasn't there before at

6071.48 --> 6079.32
all yeah if you decompress it you

6075.719 --> 6082.84
actually create negative weight isn't

6079.32 --> 6082.84
that just amazing

6083.719 --> 6090.4800000000005
yeah because weight isn't an material

6087.119 --> 6096.88
inherent ability it's not a thing of

6090.48 --> 6096.879999999999
matter it's a convention based derived

6096.92 --> 6102.639
concept yeah

6098.92 --> 6104.04
mass is a derived concept from weight

6102.639 --> 6106.4400000000005
which is a

6104.04 --> 6109.0
Convention of relative density this

6106.44 --> 6111.719
equilibrium of an object with the medium

6109.0 --> 6117.08
it is in which is air

6111.719 --> 6117.08
that's weight air weight it's a derived

6117.8 --> 6124.639
concept and it literally can manifest

6120.639 --> 6126.56
out of nothing you compress air oh it

6124.639 --> 6128.52
suddenly gains weight yeah suddenly out

6126.56 --> 6132.080000000001
of nowhere it starts to weigh things

6128.52 --> 6132.080000000001
right because weight isn't the

6132.119 --> 6138.4
thing it's just the equilibrium between

6136.36 --> 6139.759999999999
the object and the medium changing that

6138.4 --> 6142.759999999999

PayPal I'm talking about Flat Earth or

6238.88 --> 6245.0
am I not I'm doing that again any

6243.0 --> 6248.76
support would be

6245.0 --> 6251.199
great huh I mean I had to kick the dip

6248.76 --> 6254.360000000001
[ __ ] out that was like oh if only you

6251.199 --> 6256.44
talk more about that and then so he then

6254.36 --> 6259.44
had he just wanted to squirt and

6256.44 --> 6261.598999999999
endlessly whine he didn't want to

6259.44 --> 6263.638999999999
support me

6261.599 --> 6266.599
he just wanted to

6263.639 --> 6269.96
bicker that's what he wanted to

6266.599 --> 6272.56
do yeah these wankers they don't want to

6269.96 --> 6275.159
support me because I talk about things

6272.56 --> 6278.0
they just want to

6275.159 --> 6282.119
bicker get you

6496.0 --> 6501.92
yeah yeah it's good isn't it flat land

6499.44 --> 6504.719
that's why it's so amazing that it's

6501.92 --> 6506.2390000000005
specifically a in an expanded state that

6504.719 --> 6509.84
has no weight that's why that's

6506.239 --> 6509.839999999999
literally in the title a flat

6510.08 --> 6517.159
land yeah that's that's very specific

6513.119 --> 6521.4
about the expanded State part

6517.159 --> 6523.839999999999
yeah it's all about the ratio of the

6521.4 --> 6526.32
density of the object which could be

6523.84 --> 6529.159000000001
gases right if it's contained

6526.32 --> 6531.759999999999
properly versus the density average of

6529.159 --> 6534.239
the medium it is in

6531.76 --> 6537.2390000000005
which is going to be gas in its expanded

6534.239 --> 6537.239
State

6541.52 --> 6547.2390000000005
typically right but I mean a

6545.159 --> 6551.119
tank you're going to

6547.239 --> 6554.36
weigh doesn't have a vacuum in it though

6551.119 --> 6558.759999999999
it just has some regular air in its

6554.36 --> 6562.48
expanded state within it that's what's

6558.76 --> 6566.599
unless nobody like vacuum pumps a gas

6562.48 --> 6570.239
tank you see it's always going to end up

6566.599 --> 6573.360000000001
being filled with gas that's going to

6570.239 --> 6576.87
have an average density equal to the

6573.36 --> 6579.639
thing the air that's outside

6576.87 --> 6582.5199999999995
[Music]

6579.639 --> 6584.6900000000005
it because then the pressure equalizes

6582.52 --> 6587.780000000001
you

6584.69 --> 6587.78

6621.28 --> 6624.719
the [ __ ] are you talking about

6649.04 --> 6652.04
kevler

6667.44 --> 6671.96
right but I mean adamin said earli you

6669.48 --> 6675.678999999999
can't weigh

6671.96 --> 6678.8
air you can weigh it if it's in a

6675.679 --> 6680.679
container but if it's just in a

6678.8 --> 6684.079000000001
container and it's expand State there's

6680.679 --> 6685.719
going to be a zero differential result

6684.079 --> 6688.239
so it's going to register is not

6685.719 --> 6691.199
weighing anything then what is in

6688.239 --> 6693.199
there you can technically weigh it

6691.199 --> 6696.0
because weighing is just a derived

6693.199 --> 6699.638999999999
concept you sure you can

6696.0 --> 6702.159
weigh gas doesn't mean it actually has

6699.639 --> 6704.88
weight in its expanded state if it's in

6702.159 --> 6708.239
its expanded State the result of the

6704.88 --> 6712.84
weighing process is going to be

6708.239 --> 6716.5599999999995
zero cuz gas doesn't inherently have

6712.84 --> 6719.84
weight because weight is a convention

6716.56 --> 6723.52
something we do with

6719.84 --> 6727.400000000001
material to then derive the weight from

6723.52 --> 6730.280000000001
that process it's not Material in

6727.4 --> 6732.839999999999
eron even in a container you cannot

6730.28 --> 6736.5599999999995
weigh it well Tech that's not true Adam

6732.84 --> 6738.88
you can weigh it if it's completely

6736.56 --> 6741.4800000000005
closed there will be weight

6738.88 --> 6744.28
differentials if you like really fill it

6741.48 --> 6748.919999999999
up it's going to weigh

6744.28 --> 6752.88
more than if it's open and equal

6748.92 --> 6755.04
pressure as the outside yes it will have

6752.88 --> 6757.96
more weight the weight will not compart

6755.04 --> 6761.92
to like atomic weight or

6757.96 --> 6764.84
anything but if it's

6761.92 --> 6768.32
compressed it will weigh

6764.84 --> 6768.32
more that's just

6768.84 --> 6773.92
true

6770.76 --> 6775.079000000001
like the result of the weighing process

6773.92 --> 6777.599
will

6775.079 --> 6780.04
yield

6777.599 --> 6782.719
weight I'm not understand what the [ __ ]

6780.04 --> 6785.119
are you talking

6782.719 --> 6788.4
about I

6785.119 --> 6790.598999999999
am this is my freaking Niche subject

6788.4 --> 6793.96
this is the [ __ ] little subject that

6790.599 --> 6796.4400000000005
I talk about on my Channel all the time

6793.96 --> 6798.36
half for years I freaking understand

6796.44 --> 6800.28
this I was the one that brought it to

6798.36 --> 6802.598999999999
the freaking table at

6800.28 --> 6802.599
what the

6805.84 --> 6809.88
hell yes I understand

6816.32 --> 6822.5599999999995
this that I missed the point I brought

6819.599 --> 6824.8
the freaking subject to the table what

6822.56 --> 6827.719
are you talking about miss the

6824.8 --> 6830.28
point I did not miss the point at all

6827.719 --> 6833.079
Adam what the [ __ ]

6830.28 --> 6837.199
I've heard this conversation like 200

6833.079 --> 6840.32
times I did not miss the point I did not

6837.199 --> 6842.96
forget the point I know every freaking

6840.32 --> 6845.84
Point yeah no need to be rude well then

6842.96 --> 6847.76
don't say something as stupid as that

6845.84 --> 6851.32
you missed the point I did not miss the

6847.76 --> 6854.04
point I get weight I get Mass I get the

6851.32 --> 6856.599
weighing process I get gas I get what it

6854.04 --> 6859.28
is I get its abilities I mean I freaking

6856.599 --> 6862.52
Master this [ __ ] like I'm about to do an

6859.28 --> 6865.96

6862.52 --> 6867.88
master this [ __ ] yes I damn well get it

6865.96 --> 6869.719
it's the only damn thing I get like

6867.88 --> 6872.639
nothing

6869.719 --> 6875.4
else you disagree with my incorrect

6872.639 --> 6877.719
assertion what about it do you

6875.4 --> 6879.879999999999
disagree why didn't you feed back to me

6877.719 --> 6883.0
that you even understood what I said

6879.88 --> 6883.0
maybe you just misheard

6885.96 --> 6891.679
me the [ __ ] are you talking about klar

6888.8 --> 6891.679
you missed r

6894.92 --> 6897.52
think this is

6904.43 --> 6907.6

yeah you get the [ __ ] off Aries

6948.599 --> 6951.599
wanker

6961.679 --> 6965.119
no I don't know what the hell is going

6963.04 --> 6967.079
on with Adam he's just [ __ ] wrong

6965.119 --> 6969.079
yeah and just because it's you Adam that

6967.079 --> 6971.84
doesn't mean that you're always right

6969.079 --> 6973.679
yeah you're wrong you didn't hear what

6971.84 --> 6976.28
the hell I was talking

6973.679 --> 6978.2390000000005
about I'm not inconsistent in what I've

6976.28 --> 6982.32
been saying I've been consistent with

6978.239 --> 6982.32
how I've explained this for

6982.48 --> 6988.159
years I've done this conversation like

6985.0 --> 6991.32
10 times now on my show dedicated like

6988.159 --> 6994.5599999999995
an hour to this freaking bickering this

6991.32 --> 7000.199
specific type of bickering specifically

6994.56 --> 7002.76
this subject yeah like 10 hours nonstop

7000.199 --> 7005.759999999999
this specific

7002.76 --> 7007.92
subject I know what how this works I

7005.76 --> 7010.639
can't even accidentally get it wrong

7007.92 --> 7014.0
anymore that's how much how this works

7010.639 --> 7016.88
is ingrained in my system I don't get it

7014.0 --> 7016.88
wrong I get it

7022.35 --> 7029.76
[Music]

7025.0 --> 7031.28
right yeah gas air in an expanded State

7029.76 --> 7033.88
doesn't have weight because the

7031.28 --> 7038.44
equilibrium with the surrounding is

7033.88 --> 7040.36
exactly zero it's exactly the same

7038.44 --> 7042.28
that's why there is no weight because

7040.36 --> 7046.32
there's no

7042.28 --> 7050.4
differential because weight is a derived

7046.32 --> 7051.639
concept yeah if you compress air in a

7050.4 --> 7055.48
closed

7051.639 --> 7057.599
tank it's going to register weight

7055.48 --> 7060.839999999999
because the air isn't in an expanded

7057.599 --> 7062.88
State anymore it's not able to equalize

7060.84 --> 7066.599
with the

7062.88 --> 7068.96
surrounding and then yeah there is a

7066.599 --> 7070.159000000001
disequilibrium the amount of density in

7068.96 --> 7072.96
that same

7070.159 --> 7075.92
volume becomes

7072.96 --> 7078.079
bigger than the average density of the

7075.92 --> 7081.119
medium it is in which is still air it's

7078.079 --> 7081.119
just not compressed

7094.679 --> 7100.4
air I'm trolling no I don't know what

7096.96 --> 7103.04
the hell is going on with him but yeah I

7100.4 --> 7104.719
will gladly discard your input Adam I

7103.04 --> 7107.4
mean if you want to have a fight over

7104.719 --> 7109.36
this in the next month fine have a fight

7107.4 --> 7110.96
with me over this the next month I know

7109.36 --> 7113.598999999999
what the hell I'm talking about I got

7110.96 --> 7115.92
this right the previous

7113.599 --> 7118.2390000000005
times every

7115.92 --> 7120.28
time I know what I'm talking I don't

7118.239 --> 7123.0
need input from anybody else I don't

7120.28 --> 7126.36
even need criticism from QE I know what

7123.0 --> 7128.76
I'm talking about is exactly right and I

7126.36 --> 7130.48
don't give a [ __ ] who if even if Nathan

7128.76 --> 7132.76
comes in here tells me I'm wrong I'm

7130.48 --> 7136.959999999999
going to say [ __ ] you Nathan you're

7132.76 --> 7139.400000000001
wrong I know what this is this is my

7136.96 --> 7142.44
specialty I've had this discussion so

7139.4 --> 7144.48
many times I don't even consciously

7142.44 --> 7147.799999999999
think in the process anymore that's how

7144.48 --> 7149.799999999999
automated this whole thing is in my mind

7147.8 --> 7152.88
I know what I'm talking about I got it

7149.8 --> 7155.360000000001
right I don't care what you think about

7152.88 --> 7158.719
it you go make a presentation that

7155.36 --> 7163.119
contradicts mine and I'll look at it but

7158.719 --> 7165.44
you just saying uhuh yeah no Adam no I

7163.119 --> 7168.0
got it right I got it right

7165.44 --> 7170.159
exactly if you want to demonstrate me

7168.0 --> 7174.04
wrong then go and demonstrate me wrong

7170.159 --> 7177.48
but just you saying nuh-uh no I got this

7174.04 --> 7181.96
right I know I did nobody's has to tell

7177.48 --> 7181.959999999999
me differently because I know I got this

7185.719 --> 7191.119
right yes Adam I will keep reaffirming

7188.719 --> 7193.84
it because I did have it right and you

7191.119 --> 7196.598999999999
have not delivered any argumentation

7193.84 --> 7196.599
that proves the

7218.159 --> 7221.159
contrary

7234.52 --> 7237.320000000001
yeah go and do that then you bringing up

7236.48 --> 7239.28
on

7237.32 --> 7242.4
Monday I've already brought this

7239.28 --> 7245.48
conversation up many times yeah Adam

7242.4 --> 7248.679
maybe you forgot I didn't forget the

7245.48 --> 7250.879999999999
previous 10 times that I had an hourong

7248.679 --> 7254.4400000000005
conversation about this very specific

7250.88 --> 7257.28
subject on my show in the last decade I

7254.44 --> 7260.638999999999
forgot I did not forget a single

7257.28 --> 7262.88
time I know how these arguments went I

7260.639 --> 7265.679
know how you were involved in the

7262.88 --> 7269.28
arguments the previous times and how you

7265.679 --> 7272.4
definitely agreed to the final result of

7269.28 --> 7274.719
my explanation every single time because

7272.4 --> 7277.92
I am right and I don't know why you're

7274.719 --> 7280.84
even having this attitude right now Adam

7277.92 --> 7282.159
I don't really care cuz I know I'm right

7280.84 --> 7285.1990000000005
and you're

7282.159 --> 7289.0
wrong and you haven't actually delivered

7285.199 --> 7292.0
any argumentation that proves the

7289.0 --> 7294.48
contrary so I don't really care what you

7292.0 --> 7298.8
say at this

7294.48 --> 7302.28
point yeah bring cowbell or whatever man

7298.8 --> 7304.76
you just bring it up another day

7302.28 --> 7306.88
then do

7304.76 --> 7309.280000000001
that or you could just bring the

7306.88 --> 7310.4400000000005
argumentation you know you could just

7309.28 --> 7313.599
type

7310.44 --> 7317.079
it get it over with not

7313.599 --> 7317.079
wait 20

7319.199 --> 7323.44
hours if you're so certain that I'm

7321.48 --> 7326.04
wrong you should be able to literally

7323.44 --> 7329.44
write it down exactly how I'm wrong

7326.04 --> 7331.88
right now since you're so certain of it

7329.44 --> 7334.079
already don't have to wait 20 hours to

7331.88 --> 7334.079
do

7335.76 --> 7340.96
that oh it

7337.96 --> 7340.96
cannot

7341.719 --> 7347.96
okay sure so so what's adding the

7345.199 --> 7349.96
disequilibrium pressure then when you

7347.96 --> 7352.76
compress gas in a

7349.96 --> 7354.199
tank what's C what's where's that weight

7352.76 --> 7358.04
coming

7354.199 --> 7361.28
from before you compressed all that gas

7358.04 --> 7363.119
in the tank and you waited and after you

7361.28 --> 7365.079
compressed all that gas in the tank and

7363.119 --> 7368.48
then waited where did it come from then

7365.079 --> 7369.5199999999995
Adam just manifested out of nothing or

7368.48 --> 7373.36
what is wa

7369.52 --> 7377.52
oh so you're going to ask me a question

7373.36 --> 7382.96
in reut to my question are

7377.52 --> 7385.92
you oh yes yes so what is waight what is

7382.96 --> 7389.079
the word is

7385.92 --> 7391.76
right why does the word wait have a t in

7389.079 --> 7395.759999999999
it this is all super

7391.76 --> 7397.96
relevant yeah or you could just say hey

7395.76 --> 7400.719
why is there a differential in this on

7397.96 --> 7402.76
the on the reading the scale after you

7400.719 --> 7405.92
filled the tank with gas you could do

7402.76 --> 7405.92
that too you

7406.679 --> 7411.92
know you don't have to establish what

7409.32 --> 7416.719
weight is in order to establish that the

7411.92 --> 7419.679
reading on the machine has

7416.719 --> 7422.679
changed yeah and then after that point

7419.679 --> 7426.32
we can philosophically debate on what

7422.679 --> 7429.599
weight really is but until then you can

7426.32 --> 7432.719
definitely confirm that the SK

7429.599 --> 7435.719
will have a different

7432.719 --> 7435.719
reading

7444.199 --> 7449.598999999999
huh now I'm just talking about the

7446.639 --> 7452.2390000000005
convention Adam the the use of the scale

7449.599 --> 7454.52
that's what weight is it's a

7452.239 --> 7459.4
disequilibrium pressure differential

7454.52 --> 7463.2390000000005
that is red in kilograms on a scale

7459.4 --> 7467.04
now as to what that is what weight is or

7463.239 --> 7469.239
where does it come from is completely

7467.04 --> 7472.719
irrelevant all I know is that if you

7469.239 --> 7475.678999999999
fill a a tank with gas and you compress

7472.719 --> 7479.079
it and you then put it on a scale it

7475.679 --> 7480.52
will read a different readout as before

7479.079 --> 7485.0
you filled it

7480.52 --> 7488.119000000001
up I don't care what weight is I don't

7485.0 --> 7490.32
care what mass is all I care about is

7488.119 --> 7493.679
that the re read out on the scale is

7490.32 --> 7496.04
different I don't care what it even says

7493.679 --> 7498.88
is different I just know there's a

7496.04 --> 7501.84
difference yeah there's a difference

7498.88 --> 7501.84
there's something

7504.199 --> 7509.719
changed what it what you classify it as

7508.28 --> 7513.88
is completely

7509.719 --> 7513.88
irrelevant what I know is it

7517.679 --> 7520.679
changed

7525.719 --> 7529.92

yeah I'm doing this show every day not

you're going to PayPal me

7577.599 --> 7580.599
yeah

7588.04 --> 7590.88
wait is the

7591.599 --> 7596.32
classification I'm sorry this is your

7594.84 --> 7598.119000000001
issue I don't know what you're even

7596.32 --> 7601.599
talking about classification

7598.119 --> 7604.558999999999
misconception all I'm saying is a in an

7601.599 --> 7608.2390000000005
expanded state has no weight but if you

7604.559 --> 7609.52
fill a gas tank that is empty you fill

7608.239 --> 7611.598999999999
it up

7609.52 --> 7614.679
then the disequilibrium pressure that it

7611.599 --> 7617.84
will cause in a medium of air becomes

7614.679 --> 7621.639
greater which in a readout of on a scale

7617.84 --> 7623.4800000000005
will say it has increased in weight even

7621.639 --> 7625.84
though that's just a convention yeah but

7623.48 --> 7627.879999999999
there's definitely a difference there

7625.84 --> 7631.159000000001
and I don't care what the [ __ ] you call

7627.88 --> 7635.639
that I just know there's a

7631.159 --> 7639.0
difference if you compress air it will

7635.639 --> 7642.4800000000005
cause a reading of weight when you

7639.0 --> 7643.88
measure weight even though weight isn't

7642.48 --> 7648.199
actually a

7643.88 --> 7648.1990000000005
thing it's still measurable

7655.28 --> 7660.239
there shut the [ __ ] up what the [ __ ] do

7658.0 --> 7664.36
you think you are

7660.239 --> 7664.36
dude you're all being such

7664.719 --> 7670.52
wankers don't talk to me like that cflar

7672.0 --> 7679.159
you think this is the normal way to get

7674.4 --> 7679.159
back on my show behaving like

7685.92 --> 7691.119
this yeah I know why I'm correct because

7689.239 --> 7694.879999999999
I've been talking about this for a

7691.119 --> 7697.799999999999
decade I don't give a [ __ ] if Fineman

7694.88 --> 7700.400000000001
himself would show up in my chat or call

7697.8 --> 7702.320000000001
in through Skype and tell me I'm wrong I

7700.4 --> 7704.44
know I'm [ __ ] right I don't care if

7702.32 --> 7708.28
the entire [ __ ] world tells me I'm

7704.44 --> 7710.44
wrong I know I'm right I can argue I'm

7708.28 --> 7713.119
right and I haven't heard a single

7710.44 --> 7715.199
argument that actually contradicts the

7713.119 --> 7717.679
things that I've said yeah you can

7715.199 --> 7719.799999999999
explain things in another way but that

7717.679 --> 7721.1990000000005
doesn't contradict anything that I've

7719.8 --> 7723.320000000001
said everything that I've said is

7721.199 --> 7725.96
perfectly accurate and

7723.32 --> 7728.96
true and there's nothing anybody can do

7725.96 --> 7731.679
about it including Adam mean

7728.96 --> 7734.119
I'm just right I don't care if you agree

7731.679 --> 7734.119
with me or

7738.8 --> 7745.76
not yeah here in expanded state does not

7742.32 --> 7750.799999999999
have weight because the equilibrium with

7745.76 --> 7752.360000000001
the medium is zero it's no difference so

7750.8 --> 7755.84
it's going to be the same so it's not

7752.36 --> 7761.04
going to lead to this equilibrium

7755.84 --> 7767.119000000001
pressure that we would read on scale as

7761.04 --> 7767.119
weight but if it's not in a expanded

7767.36 --> 7771.719
state if it's

7769.4 --> 7774.239
compressed well that's not in an

7771.719 --> 7776.44
expanded State and then yeah the density

7774.239 --> 7778.638999999999
becomes higher on average it's

7776.44 --> 7783.119
compressed so the density does actually

7778.639 --> 7786.76
become higher and that will yield a

7783.119 --> 7791.239
different result in the measuring on a

7786.76 --> 7791.2390000000005
scale it will see seem to weigh

7794.0 --> 7798.8
more right and that doesn't mean that

7796.559 --> 7801.0
gas in an expanded Spate does weigh

7798.8 --> 7803.96
something you just have to compress it

7801.0 --> 7807.36
to make it weigh no it's because weight

7803.96 --> 7810.719
itself weighing is just a stupid

7807.36 --> 7814.0
convention where you compare the

7810.719 --> 7816.88
density with the medium of air you're in

7814.0 --> 7819.04
and that's it so yeah if you're going to

7816.88 --> 7820.639
measure air in expanded then of course

7819.04 --> 7822.559
it's not going to weigh anything because

7820.639 --> 7826.76
that's the medium you're weighing things

7822.559 --> 7826.76
in that's what you're comparing it

7828.76 --> 7834.400000000001
to propane is liquid yeah that's not gas

7831.88 --> 7834.400000000001
then is

7837.159 --> 7844.129
it whoes oxygen then compare to

7841.05 --> 7844.129
[Music]

7847.239 --> 7850.239
what

7855.8 --> 7859.84
okay pan it's getting dark

7860.26 --> 7863.879
[Music]

7877.159 --> 7880.159
here

7907.159 --> 7910.159
w

7919.88 --> 7924.52
what what does that mean ging

7924.76 --> 7930.719
wisdom weight and the

7927.04 --> 7934.84
gradient well gas in its expanded state

7930.719 --> 7938.679
is not affected like

7934.84 --> 7941.599
that weight is merely a convention right

7938.679 --> 7945.28
and the gradient is not affected by

7941.599 --> 7947.52
weight it's affected by gas having the

7945.28 --> 7950.44
natural tendency to move in all

7947.52 --> 7952.4800000000005
directions and the way it moves in all

7950.44 --> 7955.199
directions being altered by a

7952.48 --> 7957.678999999999
temperature

7955.199 --> 7959.839999999999
influence and that's what causes this

7957.679 --> 7962.04
dynamic system to have the gradient as

7959.84 --> 7962.04
it

7964.159 --> 7969.32
does temperature must be a Convention as

7967.199 --> 7972.759999999999
well

7969.32 --> 7975.32
no temperature can be absolute like the

7972.76 --> 7975.320000000001
reading is

7981.04 --> 7986.84
absolute although there the the way like

7984.719 --> 7990.679
Celsius versus

7986.84 --> 7994.079
Fahrenheit that's two

7990.679 --> 7996.079
conventions but the system itself is

7994.079 --> 7998.28
perfectly consistent the temperature

7996.079 --> 8002.32
always stays that same temperature no

7998.28 --> 8004.92
matter the state you're in well

8002.32 --> 8007.4
waight yeah that actually changes

8004.92 --> 8008.84
depending on the state you're in a lot

8007.4 --> 8011.558999999999
yeah temperature doesn't do that

8008.84 --> 8013.84
temperature is always the same

8011.559 --> 8015.84
temperature whatever of the two

8013.84 --> 8018.719
conventions you use doesn't really it's

8015.84 --> 8020.4800000000005
just like oh this ruler or that ruler

8018.719 --> 8022.2390000000005
well the readout of those rulers is

8020.48 --> 8024.44
always going to be the same because even

8022.239 --> 8027.239
if the conditions and everything changed

8024.44 --> 8031.239
completely the temperature reading still

8027.239 --> 8034.678999999999
works the the same which makes it real

8031.239 --> 8036.718999999999
thing an absolute thing the temperature

8034.679 --> 8039.88
is absolute it never changes depending

8036.719 --> 8042.8
on the condition the temperature never

8039.88 --> 8046.2390000000005
works differently depending on the

8042.8 --> 8048.719
conditions weight Works

8046.239 --> 8051.119
differently depending on the conditions

8048.719 --> 8054.199
and that's why you even have such a

8051.119 --> 8056.119
thing as water weight and vacuum weight

8054.199 --> 8058.36
which are examples of different

8056.119 --> 8061.32
conditions see and that's how you know

8058.36 --> 8064.239
weight is not an absolute it is not

8061.32 --> 8066.639
matter inherent it's a convention

8064.239 --> 8069.919999999999
temperature reading

8066.639 --> 8072.119
is a Convention as in what type of

8069.92 --> 8075.76
measuring stick you're going to

8072.119 --> 8078.04
use but the temperature itself is

8075.76 --> 8080.4800000000005
absolute and material

8078.04 --> 8083.079
inherent it the temperature doesn't

8080.48 --> 8084.839999999999
change how you measure it depending on

8083.079 --> 8089.88
the

8084.84 --> 8089.88
conditions weight does

8093.37 --> 8096.5689999999995
[Music]

8096.8 --> 8100.2390000000005
hot and cold are concept no those are

8098.52 --> 8104.92
just descriptions it's not even a

8100.239 --> 8104.919999999999
concept right roads hot and cold are

8110.079 --> 8118.079
descriptions decrease celvin yeah Kelvin

8113.96 --> 8119.84
too but that's just a measuring stick

8118.079 --> 8121.36
conventions like what stick are you

8119.84 --> 8123.639
going to use for the

8121.36 --> 8127.199
temperature but the temperature and how

8123.639 --> 8129.400000000001
you measure it does not change depending

8127.199 --> 8133.48
on the

8129.4 --> 8135.079
circumstances how you measure weight

8133.48 --> 8136.959999999999
does

8135.079 --> 8138.88
differentiate depending on the

8136.96 --> 8141.639
circumstances and that's the main

8138.88 --> 8145.079
difference that's how you know weight is

8141.639 --> 8147.84
purely convention based it's just a

8145.079 --> 8150.119
mechanism while temperature never does

8147.84 --> 8151.559
does change it's always the same

8150.119 --> 8156.48
whatever measuring stick you're going to

8151.559 --> 8156.4800000000005
use for it it never changes the way it's

8174.4 --> 8179.36
measured so I really hope that clarified

8177.04 --> 8182.0
a lot of things

8179.36 --> 8184.759999999999
me having to endlessly repeat

8182.0 --> 8186.84
it over and over again I guess some

8184.76 --> 8188.92
things you just have to say a 100

8186.84 --> 8190.679
thousand times before people start

8188.92 --> 8194.319
bickering against

8190.679 --> 8197.16
it that they no longer see that there is

8194.319 --> 8200.199999999999
no more way

8197.16 --> 8203.2
out can't figure out something that you

8200.2 --> 8206.359
could say that could undo what I say to

8203.2 --> 8208.399000000001
be true cuz there isn't anything you can

8206.359 --> 8211.0
say that would undo what I just

8208.399 --> 8213.88
described it does work like this it

8211.0 --> 8216.28
always works like this always and it

8213.88 --> 8216.279999999999
always

8229.879 --> 8239.599

8560.12 --> 8564.479000000001
was disagreeing because of a

8561.76 --> 8566.24
misunderstanding or something I don't

anyway

8810.479 --> 8815.56
I don't care

8812.479 --> 8818.319
censoring censorship have to do with

8815.56 --> 8820.399
anything I'm not afraid of censorship I

8818.319 --> 8823.08
got my own

8820.399 --> 8826.358999999999
channel I have my own Channel that I can

8823.08 --> 8829.359
literally talk on without anybody even

8826.359 --> 8831.399000000001
being capable of interrupting me I'm not

8829.359 --> 8833.24
worried about censorship on my own

8831.399 --> 8838.399
channel

8833.24 --> 8840.359
dude nobody's going to censor me here

8838.399 --> 8843.92
unless I break the terms and conditions

8840.359 --> 8848.76
of blah blah blah YouTube hor

8843.92 --> 8852.16
[ __ ] you time view out yeah that yes I

8848.76 --> 8855.08
did yes I did because I didn't like your

8852.16 --> 8855.08
attitude that's

8860.72 --> 8867.039999999999
why and that was a problem before that's

8865.0 --> 8869.399
the reason I banned you originally it's

8867.04 --> 8869.399000000001
because the

8870.279 --> 8876.399000000001
attitude right but hey you want to get

8872.88 --> 8877.92
me on and talk about stuff that's fine

8876.399 --> 8880.358999999999
just so you realize if you're going to

8877.92 --> 8883.479
be about air having weight and endless

8880.359 --> 8886.12
bickering I'm not going to verbally do a

8883.479 --> 8888.56
back and forth about the same damn thing

8886.12 --> 8891.640000000001
that I've exactly been doing right here

8888.56 --> 8895.119999999999
with the chat for like an hour now yeah

8891.64 --> 8895.119999999999
that's not something I'm going to

8895.64 --> 8899.519999999999
do

8897.56 --> 8903.039999999999
I'll have a short discussion if you

8899.52 --> 8905.439
think that being able to speak it out

8903.04 --> 8907.800000000001
verbally is going to progress the

8905.439 --> 8910.479000000001
argumentation or clarification of the

8907.8 --> 8913.278999999999
situation then sure but I'm not just

8910.479 --> 8917.0
going to do the same bickering as has

8913.279 --> 8919.319000000001
already been happening here for another

8917.0 --> 8921.12
hour with somebody else on the

8919.319 --> 8923.92
microphone doing it instead of in the

8921.12 --> 8925.6
chat with the same things yeah I'm not

8923.92 --> 8928.6
going to do

8925.6 --> 8928.6
that

8931.96 --> 8935.72
they're trying to get Adam yeah but he's

8933.439 --> 8938.56
not going to come on my show especially

8935.72 --> 8940.64
with his [ __ ] yeah he's going to try to

8938.56 --> 8942.76
make a case on Monday and then be really

8940.64 --> 8946.119999999999
freaking embarrassed when qwi and Nathan

8942.76 --> 8948.52
tell him that I was right because I am

8946.12 --> 8950.640000000001
right I don't even know what the hell he

8948.52 --> 8953.439
was thinking maybe he found some weird

8950.64 --> 8957.08
little flub or

8953.439 --> 8960.84
something it not consequential though

8957.08 --> 8960.84
doesn't undo anything that I've

8973.68 --> 8979.76
said bet Adam wears glasses uh yeah

8982.399 --> 8985.519999999999
so what the hell does that have to do

8984.68 --> 8988.52
with

8985.52 --> 8988.52
anything

8989.54 --> 8994.359
[Music]

8992.16 --> 8997.56
don't dis Adam

8994.359 --> 9000.76
dude seriously Adam is arguably my best

8997.56 --> 9000.76
friend in the entire

9001.479 --> 9005.679999999998
Arena but sometimes he just really wants

9004.319 --> 9007.72
to

9005.68 --> 9009.12
disagree I don't know why the hell he

9007.72 --> 9011.599999999999
does

9009.12 --> 9015.319000000001
that you know what that means yeah it

9011.6 --> 9017.880000000001
means that you're bringing on a stupid

9015.319 --> 9020.119999999999
joke that definit does not apply it's

9017.88 --> 9020.119999999999
not

9040.92 --> 9046.16
funny I mean I'm not going to call a guy

9043.8 --> 9048.599999999999
that's arguably my friend gay because he

9046.16 --> 9053.479
wear glasses even though he has kids and

9048.6 --> 9053.479000000001
I don't okay just not going to do

9060.16 --> 9063.309
[Music]

9065.55 --> 9069.878999999999
[Music]

9073.64 --> 9078.119999999999

9077.12 --> 9080.640000000001
him

9078.12 --> 9084.439
on sure it's just not about this

9080.64 --> 9087.8
bickering subject please for love of

9084.439 --> 9089.68
God I don't like this bickering I just

9087.8 --> 9092.8
wish everybody would just get it right

9089.68 --> 9094.56
and stop arguing with me I just have it

9092.8 --> 9097.519999999999
right I'm

9094.56 --> 9099.72
sorry I know you don't want me to have

9097.52 --> 9102.399000000001
it right but I do I did get it right I

9099.72 --> 9105.358999999999
get it right I get it right all the time

9102.399 --> 9107.96
I spend more hours bickering about this

9105.359 --> 9109.960000000001
type of subject than arguably any other

9107.96 --> 9111.88
freaking person in the world at this

9109.96 --> 9115.0
point

9111.88 --> 9117.759999999998
okay about this very specific thing I've

9115.0 --> 9120.88
probably argued more than any other

9117.76 --> 9120.880000000001
person in the

9122.279 --> 9126.0
world I get it

9130.16 --> 9134.72
right you wanted to hear about thousand

9133.08 --> 9136.439
years added to the time oh that's

9134.72 --> 9139.319
something I definitely would want to

9136.439 --> 9141.359
talk about with Adam I mean if I'm going

9139.319 --> 9143.84
to get Adam I want to get historical

9141.359 --> 9146.319
because basically he is my teacher and

9143.84 --> 9150.08
I'm the student when it comes to like

9146.319 --> 9151.278999999999
old history stuff he's read all of it I

9150.08 --> 9153.64
did

9151.279 --> 9158.52
not I'm just hearing it through other

9153.64 --> 9161.72
people like him and then judging that

9158.52 --> 9161.720000000001
and combining and

9165.08 --> 9171.56
comparing what

9167.64 --> 9171.56
says otherwise y

9175.84 --> 9180.8
whatever have to explain this in detail

9178.279 --> 9184.439
again and about oh shut up Richard I

9180.8 --> 9184.438999999998
know that's true I hate

9186.0 --> 9192.16
it I mean seriously air in an expanded

9189.359 --> 9194.800000000001
State having no weight is like the Flat

9192.16 --> 9197.359
Earth within Flat Earth where everybody

9194.8 --> 9199.399
gives Like A Flat Earth response as if

9197.359 --> 9201.800000000001
they were a baller even though they're

9199.399 --> 9204.439
already flat earther to

9201.8 --> 9208.438999999998
