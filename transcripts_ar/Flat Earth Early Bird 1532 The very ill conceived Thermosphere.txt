6.06 --> 37.399
foreign

7.52 --> 37.399
[Music]

37.8 --> 39.8
um

44.719 --> 49.64
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

48.18 --> 53.16
bird number

49.64 --> 54.78
1532 I'm your host Arwin and before I

53.16 --> 57.718999999999994
start the show please don't forget to

54.78 --> 60.059
share it on any platform medium fit and

57.719 --> 62.399
if you haven't already subscribe to my

60.059 --> 64.44
channel and hit the Bell notification so

62.399 --> 66.84
you know when I'm going live which is

64.44 --> 68.64
normally 1pm Amsterdam time and weekdays

66.84 --> 71.34
and 2PM Amsterdam time in the weekend

68.64 --> 73.5
and please also do support me through

71.34 --> 76.5
the PayPal patreon and membership system

73.5 --> 78.659
join button that'll be much appreciated

76.5 --> 80.64
and yeah I could definitely use the

78.659 --> 82.92
support still

80.64 --> 84.06
so please keep it coming guys

82.92 --> 86.759
right

84.06 --> 90.9
whether today is kind of weird

86.759 --> 92.46
it's snowing it's it was snowing like a

90.9 --> 94.979
lot harder

92.46 --> 97.19999999999999
like 10 minutes ago but it's still kind

94.979 --> 99.17999999999999
of snowing I don't know if the camera's

97.2 --> 102.659
picking it up

99.18 --> 104.46000000000001
well yeah it's been snowing

102.659 --> 106.32000000000001
although yeah that snow is not gonna

104.46 --> 108.41999999999999
hang around I mean as soon as it touches

106.32 --> 110.82
down it melts

108.42 --> 112.92
out there because it's not freezing at

110.82 --> 114.65899999999999
all

112.92 --> 117.43900000000001
but it's snowing

114.659 --> 117.43900000000001
it's kind of funny

118.619 --> 121.68
I can't believe it took this long

119.939 --> 124.579
normally it snows like somewhere in

121.68 --> 124.57900000000001
February but

125.34 --> 129.86
I guess this year it's March

136.56 --> 142.94
right anyway hello tarot 306 first in

139.739 --> 142.94
chat good to see you

143.16 --> 147.78
snowing in match what what are you

145.98 --> 149.64
talking about

147.78 --> 151.819
you're talking about some sports or

149.64 --> 151.819
something

154.379 --> 159.78
right

155.7 --> 162.78
anyway it is Tuesday the 7th of March

159.78 --> 162.78
2023

163.8 --> 167.18
March all right

169.92 --> 172.16
right

174.54 --> 181.2
yeah I mean I've seen weirder things but

178.56 --> 183.86
usually it's like somewhere in February

181.2 --> 183.85999999999999
or

184.92 --> 190.819
in April although usually it's it's hail

187.62 --> 190.81900000000002
in April anyway

192.3 --> 199.26000000000002
four degrees Celsius

194.519 --> 201.54
right it does say it's it's mixed snow

199.26 --> 204.06
and rain

201.54 --> 208.22
that's what it says

204.06 --> 208.22
so I guess that's happening

208.44 --> 212.9
it's colder than I thought though four

210.3 --> 212.9
degrees Celsius

214.56 --> 217.56
anyway

219.659 --> 222.14
foreign

226.86 --> 230.239
had a bit of a late night

230.459 --> 235.739
still got up decently early enough but

233.519 --> 238.62
still like I'm a little wonky just from

235.739 --> 240.78
staying up so late I there were just a

238.62 --> 241.98000000000002
lot of awesome things that I was doing

240.78 --> 243.599
and

241.98 --> 246.29899999999998
I mean I was having a really great

243.599 --> 248.22
evening felt good

246.299 --> 250.64000000000001
show was good flatter of the big was

248.22 --> 250.64
very good

251.76 --> 255.959
I got some really smooth sentences out

254.459 --> 258.12
even during the Flat Earth debate

255.959 --> 260.82
usually I tend to stumble like a little

258.12 --> 262.32
bit but this one was like I was really

260.82 --> 264.86
on form

262.32 --> 264.86
yesterday

266.88 --> 273.5
but then I kept up like past four

268.919 --> 273.5
o'clock and that was not wise at all

273.66 --> 280.68
but I had to like own Benjamin just

276.419 --> 282.59999999999997
upload it and I I managed to catch that

280.68 --> 284.40000000000003
after four I should just not have

282.6 --> 288.24
watched what I did

284.4 --> 292.28
and that was just hysterical

288.24 --> 292.28000000000003
total bacterian victory

292.32 --> 295.38
um

293.639 --> 297.06
so you haven't if you haven't checked

295.38 --> 302.06
that one out you got to check it out it

297.06 --> 302.06
was hilarious or it's hilarious thus far

302.52 --> 307.919
he's giving like a deep analysis of

304.8 --> 310.40000000000003
Gammas and history of them

307.919 --> 310.4
anyway

310.5 --> 316.139
I'm here now

312.6 --> 317.88
slightly wonky but I'm still fine

316.139 --> 319.979
I thought I was gonna cancel the show

317.88 --> 323.639
actually because I felt kind of sick but

319.979 --> 325.84
like around half an hour ago it it just

323.639 --> 328.98
it went away

325.84 --> 328.97999999999996
[Music]

329.52 --> 334.82
oh it's snowing there too hello ozee or

332.4 --> 334.82
odds

339.09 --> 344.34
[Music]

342.0 --> 346.94
right uh yeah look now it's a little bit

344.34 --> 346.94
more visible

348.9 --> 351.62
I think

352.44 --> 356.96
no it's not picking it out

362.39 --> 365.579
[Music]

368.46 --> 374.71999999999997
right so yeah I think I'm gonna just

370.86 --> 374.72
kind of take it easy today on the show

378.24 --> 381.199
take it easy

401.82 --> 408.56
[Music]

404.4 --> 408.56
hey Nathan Oakley 1980 good to see you

418.919 --> 421.75899999999996
all right

429.66 --> 432.66
uh

434.16 --> 436.639
right

437.34 --> 441.71999999999997
I always thought of bringing I brought

439.74 --> 445.8
it up with the guys yesterday

441.72 --> 446.94000000000005
after the after show was done Nathan but

445.8 --> 449.34000000000003
like

446.94 --> 452.699
I thought that it would be worth it to

449.34 --> 454.919
basically really put a loop over the

452.699 --> 457.979
rmosphere

454.919 --> 460.139
because I've been looking into that a

457.979 --> 463.08
little bit

460.139 --> 466.86
and had that discussion in Skype with uh

463.08 --> 469.139
QE like a week ago or something

466.86 --> 472.97900000000004
weird response from him

469.139 --> 476.94
and I think that there's like

472.979 --> 478.68
it's much more weird than like people

476.94 --> 480.84
even realize

478.68 --> 483.90000000000003
like the claims about it

480.84 --> 486.539
and I think it should be highlighted

483.9 --> 488.94
should I think it should be made into an

486.539 --> 490.5
item I mean not necessarily like a

488.94 --> 492.84
housekeeping question or something but

490.5 --> 495.66
at least an item just to

492.84 --> 498.419
really see what it is what is claimed

495.66 --> 500.34000000000003
about it where did it come from who

498.419 --> 505.25899999999996
basically made it up

500.34 --> 508.02
because it seems completely made up

505.259 --> 510.47900000000004
as in that there isn't any direct

508.02 --> 511.44
legitimacy to it although I've already

510.479 --> 513.899
had

511.44 --> 518.64
my suspicions about

513.899 --> 520.62
where the idea was conjured

518.64 --> 522.5989999999999
because I think that the idea of the

520.62 --> 527.4590000000001
thermosphere was conjured

522.599 --> 531.0600000000001
well before NASA at least that that

527.459 --> 534.66
would be very logical if most of what

531.06 --> 538.7399999999999
Earth is like was basically already

534.66 --> 541.92
designated you could say or determined

538.74 --> 543.24
within heliocentrism way before NASA

541.92 --> 545.399
started

543.24 --> 547.6800000000001
and I think that

545.399 --> 550.92
the thermosphere really found its

547.68 --> 553.62
origins in an attempt to explain

550.92 --> 554.6999999999999
falling stars

553.62 --> 558.72
like

554.7 --> 560.339
which are meteors in heliocentrism and I

558.72 --> 563.72
think that the belief in meteors might

560.339 --> 563.72
even be preceding

567.839 --> 572.4590000000001
a lot

569.459 --> 574.9799999999999
a lot of iliocentric lore

572.459 --> 577.0189999999999
because hey falling stars are a

574.98 --> 578.94
phenomenon that we sometimes get to see

577.019 --> 581.58
especially periodically in certain

578.94 --> 584.0400000000001
regions in August apparently a whole

581.58 --> 585.4200000000001
bunch of them certain places

584.04 --> 588.8389999999999
and

585.42 --> 589.68
well how do you explain that well Helios

588.839 --> 592.2
interest

589.68 --> 593.88
probably thought like yeah we we need

592.2 --> 595.5600000000001
some reason for these things that we

593.88 --> 597.72
claim are rocks

595.56 --> 599.5799999999999
to be burning up and not hitting us all

597.72 --> 602.0400000000001
the time

599.58 --> 604.38
even though we don't see them so what if

602.04 --> 606.24
the rock just fell through a region that

604.38 --> 608.7
was a thousand degrees

606.24 --> 610.62
so that it would burn up

608.7 --> 613.9200000000001
before it hit us

610.62 --> 617.3
and I think that that is actually the

613.92 --> 617.3
origin of the thermosphere

617.94 --> 624.0600000000001
right but now if here's the funny thing

621.6 --> 625.9200000000001
if you really take the thermosphere for

624.06 --> 627.899
what it's claimed to be

625.92 --> 629.459
that brings in all kinds of bizarre

627.899 --> 632.459
complications

629.459 --> 634.0999999999999
mainly how the hell are you gonna go

632.459 --> 636.779
through that

634.1 --> 638.76
with a rocket

636.779 --> 642.779
to the Moon

638.76 --> 645.8389999999999
yeah I mean never mind the uh

642.779 --> 647.459
the radiation belt

645.839 --> 651.74
right

647.459 --> 651.7399999999999
what's the name again that uh

652.44 --> 657.0600000000001
anyway the radiation belt

655.32 --> 658.5600000000001
they say oh yeah we can't really go

657.06 --> 660.8389999999999
through it but how did you get to the

658.56 --> 663.5999999999999
moon then oh yeah well how about the

660.839 --> 667.2600000000001
freaking thermosphere now imagine

663.6 --> 670.0790000000001
you're in a in a tin can basically

667.26 --> 673.8
that's loaded up with fuel

670.079 --> 676.3199999999999
yeah think of it like uh like just like

673.8 --> 680.16
a a gas tank really

676.32 --> 682.1400000000001
solid sturdy you compress gas in it and

680.16 --> 683.88
then you can like use that right well

682.14 --> 687.899
it's kind of like a rocket in a way and

683.88 --> 689.82
they do use Liquid I think

687.899 --> 692.519
for the fuel

689.82 --> 694.38
it's not solid Rockets aren't like solid

692.519 --> 696.0600000000001
fuel Rockets

694.38 --> 700.2
right

696.06 --> 703.88
but what happens when you take like a

700.2 --> 707.339
metal tank that's filled up with

703.88 --> 710.64
combustible fuel

707.339 --> 713.7
and you put it through

710.64 --> 717.5
a thousand degrees

713.7 --> 717.5
what do you think is gonna happen

720.06 --> 724.92
well first off yeah what what melts at a

723.24 --> 728.12
thousand degrees

724.92 --> 728.12
yeah metal

728.54 --> 734.279
gold silver it melts

732.959 --> 738.0
I mean

734.279 --> 739.86
gold might barely be able to escape

738.0 --> 741.779
melting because its temperature is

739.86 --> 743.5790000000001
slightly above a thousand degrees but I

741.779 --> 744.8389999999999
mean even from the claims of the

743.579 --> 747.779
thermosphere

744.839 --> 752.22
it's kind of around a thousand degrees

747.779 --> 754.5
so yeah you're going through that

752.22 --> 756.5400000000001
and then your rocket literally melts and

754.5 --> 758.459
explodes

756.54 --> 760.56
very quickly

758.459 --> 762.7199999999999
that is what normally would happen if

760.56 --> 765.66
you'd have a region that's a that's

762.72 --> 767.5790000000001
heating everything a thousand degrees

765.66 --> 769.56
it's kind of bizarre

767.579 --> 773.3389999999999
also

769.56 --> 775.38
how the hell is that even happening

773.339 --> 779.399
this thermosphere

775.38 --> 780.779
what the hell is heating that region a

779.399 --> 783.98
thousand degrees

780.779 --> 783.98
how how

784.68 --> 790.7399999999999
because they're basically claiming like

786.72 --> 794.1
it's or I don't even know if they really

790.74 --> 796.26
claim An Origin to that extreme heat but

794.1 --> 798.4200000000001
it would be like a microwave

796.26 --> 800.639
or an induction coil that's just hanging

798.42 --> 804.68
midair and melting everything that comes

800.639 --> 808.139
in between it it's just what

804.68 --> 811.26
a thousand degrees you know how much

808.139 --> 813.5
energy it requires to create a thousand

811.26 --> 813.5
degrees

813.54 --> 817.68
yeah this is not some Kettle you put on

815.88 --> 821.1
the Fire

817.68 --> 823.8599999999999
and that's happening midair

821.1 --> 826.44
how how is that happening midair what's

823.86 --> 829.0790000000001
causing that

826.44 --> 830.94
and then you get into probably what

829.079 --> 832.519
would be a [ __ ] of a response

830.94 --> 837.5400000000001
that would go into multiple directions

832.519 --> 840.779
including one that would say yeah well

837.54 --> 844.079
it's probably solar radiation

840.779 --> 848.1
right because the ozone layer here's

844.079 --> 851.3389999999999
another one another full hearty concept

848.1 --> 853.94
is supposedly directly under the

851.339 --> 853.94
thermosphere

854.7 --> 860.399
so one could then argue with all these

857.94 --> 862.6800000000001
presuppositional based claims that okay

860.399 --> 865.98
according to that setup well then the

862.68 --> 869.2199999999999
thermosphere would be like the deflected

865.98 --> 872.5790000000001
heat radiation from the Sun that's being

869.22 --> 873.899
reflected by the ozone layer and that's

872.579 --> 876.899
causing

873.899 --> 879.36
the heat from the Sun to basically fry

876.899 --> 881.279
everything there

879.36 --> 882.72
and there's another dilemma

881.279 --> 884.639
you see

882.72 --> 886.279
if the thermosphere

884.639 --> 890.04
is heated

886.279 --> 894.199
by solar radiation

890.04 --> 894.199
then where's the thermosphere at night

894.36 --> 901.82
because at night

897.36 --> 901.82
there is no sunlight

904.44 --> 907.62
um what

909.66 --> 915.42
so that would mean that meteors which

913.019 --> 919.079
you typically see at night wouldn't

915.42 --> 921.779
technically be possible to burn up

919.079 --> 923.459
because it's at night and at night the

921.779 --> 925.8
thermosphere wouldn't be hot enough

923.459 --> 930.1389999999999
because there's no sunlight to heat it

925.8 --> 930.139
and so then the meteors wouldn't burn up

933.68 --> 939.54
problematic isn't it

936.6 --> 942.24
so what the hell is this her

939.54 --> 944.579
thermosphere and how is it heated if

942.24 --> 947.16
it's heated by Sun

944.579 --> 949.079
then it wouldn't be heated at night and

947.16 --> 953.699
then you wouldn't see any meteors

949.079 --> 954.7199999999999
burning up at night above you in the

953.699 --> 957.5999999999999
thermosphere

954.72 --> 959.1
because it wouldn't be heated so what

957.6 --> 960.899
the hell is heating this supposed

959.1 --> 962.519
thermosphere

960.899 --> 965.82
and

962.519 --> 968.399
yeah there's another thing where's the

965.82 --> 970.86
local measurement confirmation right the

968.399 --> 975.06
the local temperature measurement

970.86 --> 977.6990000000001
because now all I can get is is data

975.06 --> 981.2399999999999
that says

977.699 --> 985.079
it's basically measured from the ground

981.24 --> 987.36
they use this device it's like it's kind

985.079 --> 988.5
of like a stellar spectroscopy except

987.36 --> 990.3000000000001
with heat

988.5 --> 993.0
and they can use it to point at

990.3 --> 995.16
something and then measure how hot it is

993.0 --> 997.62
right like a rock or something at the

995.16 --> 999.12
ground or a building and they can

997.62 --> 1000.68
measure its heat with that it's pretty

999.12 --> 1006.82
cool device

1000.68 --> 1006.8199999999999
but then they aim that at the sky

1007.18 --> 1015.2589999999999
and measure the heat of the sky to be a

1012.079 --> 1018.019
thousand degrees what

1015.259 --> 1021.44
how the hell are you measuring something

1018.019 --> 1025.04
that's literally invisible

1021.44 --> 1027.679
yeah because that thing they aim it at a

1025.04 --> 1030.6789999999999
building they basically aiming at

1027.679 --> 1033.02
something solid or liquid and then they

1030.679 --> 1035.8390000000002
measure the temperature reflecting it

1033.02 --> 1038.839
right through that device how do you do

1035.839 --> 1042.02
that with transparent air

1038.839 --> 1045.8799999999999
I mean this is spec this is Stellar

1042.02 --> 1045.8799999999999
spectroscopy all over again

1046.76 --> 1050.6
so that is the proof that the

1049.28 --> 1052.28
thermosphere is there and a thousand

1050.6 --> 1054.08
degrees is because they measured it

1052.28 --> 1058.22
remotely

1054.08 --> 1062.0
from the ground by aiming this device at

1058.22 --> 1064.28
invisible air and then somehow getting a

1062.0 --> 1066.74
temperature reading from that

1064.28 --> 1069.039
even though that makes absolutely no

1066.74 --> 1069.039
sense

1072.02 --> 1078.58
burning in the mesosphere

1075.679 --> 1078.5800000000002
okay

1080.36 --> 1085.1599999999999
fine

1082.16 --> 1089.44
in the message here or we could address

1085.16 --> 1089.44
the [ __ ] mesosphere too I mean

1089.96 --> 1093.82
who made up that [ __ ]

1097.4 --> 1103.4
the point is is that there's absolutely

1100.039 --> 1107.799
no proof that there is a thermosphere in

1103.4 --> 1107.799
which Things become a thousand degrees

1108.02 --> 1112.6399999999999
what there does seem to be some kind of

1110.419 --> 1115.88
a hint of even though I I don't even

1112.64 --> 1118.4
know how much I can rely on any

1115.88 --> 1120.3200000000002
actual local measurements because I

1118.4 --> 1122.8400000000001
don't think they've been made there's a

1120.32 --> 1125.299
potential possibility you literally

1122.84 --> 1128.48
can't even go up that high

1125.299 --> 1131.98
like that there is literally the barrier

1128.48 --> 1134.539
there Beyond it they just made up

1131.98 --> 1137.299
thermosphere Mesa sphere all the

1134.539 --> 1140.299
exosphere whatever sphere it's all made

1137.299 --> 1144.02
up because you can't even get there

1140.299 --> 1145.58
right but if I were to assume that a

1144.02 --> 1147.5
balloon had been going through it and

1145.58 --> 1148.1399999999999
there's been claims of that and probably

1147.5 --> 1149.96
rumors

1148.14 --> 1151.3400000000001
[Music]

1149.96 --> 1153.74
then

1151.34 --> 1155.1789999999999
there could be a place that a certain

1153.74 --> 1157.58
height where suddenly the temperature

1155.179 --> 1160.52
shifts slightly

1157.58 --> 1163.299
like oh at that height suddenly the

1160.52 --> 1167.12
temperature becomes

1163.299 --> 1168.3799999999999
slightly warmer compared to underneath

1167.12 --> 1171.4399999999998
it

1168.38 --> 1173.96
right slightly warmer however does not

1171.44 --> 1175.3400000000001
mean that Things become a thousand

1173.96 --> 1177.98
degrees

1175.34 --> 1180.6789999999999
at that height

1177.98 --> 1185.45
which is what they claim what they roll

1180.679 --> 1188.5890000000002
out there it is really bizarre

1185.45 --> 1188.589
[Music]

1196.54 --> 1218.2
[Music]

1232.16 --> 1234.8200000000002
no

1235.039 --> 1239.72
now that's a total horseshit straw man

1237.919 --> 1240.8600000000001
who what where

1239.72 --> 1244.58
yeah

1240.86 --> 1246.9189999999999
I know you stole that name from me

1244.58 --> 1249.9189999999999
you're a troll

1246.919 --> 1252.98
but uh yeah yeah you know what putting

1249.919 --> 1255.8600000000001
your hand into 100 degree oven

1252.98 --> 1257.299
eventually it's gonna freaking cook yeah

1255.86 --> 1258.559
huh

1257.299 --> 1259.82
yeah

1258.559 --> 1261.98
so

1259.82 --> 1264.26
it doesn't really matter I'm not talking

1261.98 --> 1267.5
about oh you put it in there and

1264.26 --> 1269.9
immediately it melts no but you keep it

1267.5 --> 1272.12
in there and it should melt yeah if you

1269.9 --> 1275.1200000000001
have a 200 degree oven if you put

1272.12 --> 1277.76
something in there it's gonna fry

1275.12 --> 1279.559
it's not just gonna directly burn

1277.76 --> 1281.179
because you're like putting it directly

1279.559 --> 1283.7
against the hot

1281.179 --> 1286.22
metal or whatever

1283.7 --> 1289.64
it's still gonna actually attain that

1286.22 --> 1292.64
heat though slightly slower

1289.64 --> 1295.1000000000001
right and the claim is a thousand

1292.64 --> 1297.5800000000002
degrees Celsius

1295.1 --> 1297.58
okay

1298.64 --> 1304.94
so it's not the same yeah it's a [ __ ]

1301.4 --> 1307.64
thousand degrees Celsius okay and if

1304.94 --> 1309.44
something is in there for

1307.64 --> 1312.0200000000002
some time

1309.44 --> 1314.059
who knows how long I mean it might take

1312.02 --> 1316.4
like a minute then

1314.059 --> 1318.86
if it would heat up

1316.4 --> 1321.26
if there's basically an oven of a

1318.86 --> 1323.1789999999999
thousand degrees up there oh you're not

1321.26 --> 1325.4
touching the heating metal yeah that's

1323.179 --> 1327.44
cute but it's still gonna heat

1325.4 --> 1329.179
everything up to a thousand degrees well

1327.44 --> 1331.159
guess what

1329.179 --> 1334.179
things are gonna melt

1331.159 --> 1334.179
and burn

1336.26 --> 1342.5
thousand degrees no near vacuum no

1340.46 --> 1345.2
matter to transfer that heat energy

1342.5 --> 1347.84
that's absolute horseshit

1345.2 --> 1351.5
if there is nothing there to transfer

1347.84 --> 1355.1
the heat then there is no heat

1351.5 --> 1359.179
either there is the Heat or there is not

1355.1 --> 1362.059
the heat so is the thermosphere hot is

1359.179 --> 1363.5
it that thousand degrees that is claimed

1362.059 --> 1365.4189999999999
officially

1363.5 --> 1367.039
or is it not

1365.419 --> 1370.3600000000001
huh

1367.039 --> 1370.36
why don't you make up your mind

1372.62 --> 1375.62
perfect

1376.46 --> 1380.08
makes no sense dude

1384.799 --> 1389.179
yeah the Heat

1386.78 --> 1391.46
is not I don't think that the heat is

1389.179 --> 1393.799
even claimed to rub off on you it's like

1391.46 --> 1396.02
oh there's these sparse molecules going

1393.799 --> 1397.58
around and they're a thousand degrees

1396.02 --> 1400.46
but don't worry

1397.58 --> 1402.1999999999998
but barely any of them will hit you so

1400.46 --> 1405.64
you will not heat up now I don't think

1402.2 --> 1405.64
that's how that works at all

1409.1 --> 1414.4399999999998
the heat is there or it isn't

1412.22 --> 1416.78
it if it can't transfer then there is

1414.44 --> 1419.179
that that heat isn't there

1416.78 --> 1422.1789999999999
how did it get there in the first place

1419.179 --> 1424.039
what's getting hit up that has so much

1422.179 --> 1426.64
trouble spreading around because there's

1424.039 --> 1426.64
a vacuum

1428.0 --> 1433.4
so why don't you keep recycling this

1431.059 --> 1435.3799999999999
[ __ ] rebuttal some more

1433.4 --> 1437.96
who what where

1435.38 --> 1441.3400000000001
go and do that recycle it again see if

1437.96 --> 1441.3400000000001
you can make it make sense now

1443.6 --> 1448.28
oh you're gonna go that route what is

1445.76 --> 1451.28
temperature temperature is moving

1448.28 --> 1453.22
molecules in relation to one another

1451.28 --> 1456.02
basically

1453.22 --> 1459.64
arguably theoretically creating micro

1456.02 --> 1459.6399999999999
friction which is heat

1462.62 --> 1471.5
yeah and things can be heated

1466.4 --> 1473.179
without material being hot rubbing its

1471.5 --> 1475.22
heat off

1473.179 --> 1478.76
yeah like

1475.22 --> 1483.2
if you just put energy through the air

1478.76 --> 1488.179
then something in that air

1483.2 --> 1491.0
will be heated through the energy yeah

1488.179 --> 1496.72
vibrating its molecules

1491.0 --> 1500.299
not through heat of air surrounding it

1496.72 --> 1505.059
transferring its heat to it

1500.299 --> 1505.059
do you understand who what where

1510.44 --> 1515.9
yeah hey why you keep asking these

1513.02 --> 1517.46
[ __ ] straw man questions why don't

1515.9 --> 1520.72
you [ __ ] address what I'm talking

1517.46 --> 1520.72
about you [ __ ]

1520.85 --> 1524.1789999999999
[Music]

1522.08 --> 1526.779
why don't you ask some more stupid straw

1524.179 --> 1526.779
man questions

1530.9 --> 1534.26
it's claimed to be a thousand degrees

1533.12 --> 1536.2399999999998
there

1534.26 --> 1539.779
[Music]

1536.24 --> 1543.02
yeah that claim is not oh there happens

1539.779 --> 1544.88
to be this flying molecules the couple

1543.02 --> 1547.82
of molecules they're a thousand degrees

1544.88 --> 1549.5590000000002
somehow

1547.82 --> 1551.6589999999999
they're bouncing around but they don't

1549.559 --> 1555.22
really transfer the heat so it's

1551.659 --> 1558.6200000000001
actually just a completely made up

1555.22 --> 1560.84
[ __ ] story about a thousand degrees

1558.62 --> 1563.1789999999999
being there

1560.84 --> 1566.8999999999999
I mean I could literally say there are

1563.179 --> 1569.0
unicorn molecules flying around there

1566.9 --> 1570.919
yeah they're just so sparse you could

1569.0 --> 1573.919
barely get it a whole unicorn together

1570.919 --> 1576.44
but it is the Unicorn sphere because

1573.919 --> 1579.14
there are just a couple of sparing

1576.44 --> 1582.6200000000001
unicorn molecules but if they would all

1579.14 --> 1584.48
gather a magical unicorn would form so

1582.62 --> 1585.9189999999999
it's the Unicorn sphere

1584.48 --> 1588.08
yeah

1585.919 --> 1591.26
but I mean you're not gonna get the

1588.08 --> 1595.4189999999999
Unicorn together so sparingly right this

1591.26 --> 1595.419
is absolute horse [ __ ]

1601.88 --> 1605.8400000000001
yeah why'd you leave because you didn't

1604.22 --> 1609.279
answer anything

1605.84 --> 1613.299
and you just keep on rolling out more

1609.279 --> 1617.059
nitpicky straw man questions instead of

1613.299 --> 1619.6399999999999
addressing the thermosphere and its

1617.059 --> 1622.48
claims huh

1619.64 --> 1622.48
[ __ ]

1623.72 --> 1628.91
I should run away

1625.52 --> 1632.44
with your non-answers

1628.91 --> 1634.8200000000002
[Music]

1632.44 --> 1636.38
you literally don't even know what

1634.82 --> 1638.36
you're defending

1636.38 --> 1641.659
because if you did

1638.36 --> 1644.24
you would now roll it out you would roll

1641.659 --> 1647.0
it out you wouldn't be asking straw man

1644.24 --> 1648.98
questions and then complaining how I'm

1647.0 --> 1651.679
not answering your straw man questions

1648.98 --> 1654.98
and threatening to go away to quit

1651.679 --> 1656.72
because you can't answer anything and

1654.98 --> 1658.88
you don't even know what the [ __ ]

1656.72 --> 1662.179
thermosphere is

1658.88 --> 1665.6000000000001
you heard things you put it together in

1662.179 --> 1668.659
your mind sloppily not realizing that it

1665.6 --> 1672.08
doesn't really fit it's like oh I got

1668.659 --> 1674.5390000000002
three pieces of a two-piece puzzle

1672.08 --> 1676.8799999999999
and again they keep clipping the parts

1674.539 --> 1679.34
together oh they see there's like three

1676.88 --> 1682.22
ways to click it together

1679.34 --> 1685.279
or yeah

1682.22 --> 1686.539
but it's supposed to be a two piece

1685.279 --> 1689.419
puzzle

1686.539 --> 1695.12
you don't understand the thermosphere at

1689.419 --> 1695.1200000000001
all what who what where okay

1698.84 --> 1703.9399999999998
so yeah Nathan

1701.419 --> 1705.38
hope you appreciated that roll out I

1703.94 --> 1708.74
think it's worth

1705.38 --> 1710.98
talking about and seeing what what we

1708.74 --> 1710.98
can

1711.74 --> 1716.779
yeah well like this guy see what how the

1714.62 --> 1719.3799999999999
how incoherent are these Ballers

1716.779 --> 1719.38
responding

1720.559 --> 1726.1589999999999
yeah

1723.02 --> 1729.76
right they literally don't understand

1726.159 --> 1729.7600000000002
the thermosphere

1729.86 --> 1734.4799999999998
and how could you it makes no freaking

1732.14 --> 1735.919
sense nothing about it makes sense it's

1734.48 --> 1738.679
like oh there's heat there it's super

1735.919 --> 1740.96
hot but it doesn't transfer

1738.679 --> 1743.96
so it is not actually there but it's

1740.96 --> 1745.82
super hot but yeah you don't notice it

1743.96 --> 1747.919
so it's it's just hot

1745.82 --> 1749.72
you just have to believe it's hot all

1747.919 --> 1751.4
this these hot molecules going around

1749.72 --> 1753.5
but don't worry there's not enough of

1751.4 --> 1756.14
them to actually heat up so

1753.5 --> 1758.059
it's not actually hot but it's hot there

1756.14 --> 1759.679
though a thousand degrees just think of

1758.059 --> 1762.799
it it's called thermosphere it's hot

1759.679 --> 1764.659
there but it's not actually hot because

1762.799 --> 1766.82
it's hot does it heat doesn't transfer

1764.659 --> 1768.44
with that sparing air somehow but it's

1766.82 --> 1770.779
hot though it's a thousand degrees we

1768.44 --> 1772.52
measured it how do we measure it at a

1770.779 --> 1775.46
distance

1772.52 --> 1777.86
by measuring temperature through some

1775.46 --> 1780.26
light based process

1777.86 --> 1783.799
shining the light on nothing on

1780.26 --> 1786.08
transparent very thin air and then

1783.799 --> 1789.26
somehow having that transparent very

1786.08 --> 1791.96
thin air reflect back the temperature

1789.26 --> 1794.299
information of that transparent very

1791.96 --> 1796.82
thin air in order to determine it's a

1794.299 --> 1799.6399999999999
thousand degrees really really that's

1796.82 --> 1804.1
how it works really please just believe

1799.64 --> 1804.1000000000001
it it's a thermosphere at all oh

1804.15 --> 1807.38
[Music]

1809.81 --> 1813.119
[Music]

1816.84 --> 1821.1789999999999
[Music]

1818.179 --> 1823.94
your vacuum of an invention is not a

1821.179 --> 1827.8600000000001
good idea seems a little hazardous I

1823.94 --> 1827.8600000000001
mean vacuum Chambers and Heat

1830.419 --> 1836.679
seems like

1832.1 --> 1836.6789999999999
there could all kinds of things go wrong

1838.159 --> 1842.8990000000001
you do know that if you're gonna like

1840.62 --> 1844.8799999999999
seriously heat metal

1842.899 --> 1847.34
enough for it to like become red or

1844.88 --> 1850.5800000000002
whatever it also will like start to

1847.34 --> 1852.559
evaporate more if it's not surrounded by

1850.58 --> 1859.6
proper gas pressure

1852.559 --> 1859.6
so I wouldn't try a vacuum of them

1860.299 --> 1863.9189999999999
seems very hazardous

1871.899 --> 1878.26
pressure drops induce coolant

1875.6 --> 1878.26
does it

1878.6 --> 1885.399
I don't know

1880.76 --> 1885.399
does it do that does it do that directly

1886.91 --> 1895.3400000000001
[Music]

1892.94 --> 1898.159
right or is it the other way around is

1895.34 --> 1900.32
it cooling that causes a pressure drop

1898.159 --> 1903.44
because that would make a lot more sense

1900.32 --> 1905.48
like for the gradient here on Earth that

1903.44 --> 1908.299
there that the top would be cooling as

1905.48 --> 1910.72
the ground is Heating

1908.299 --> 1910.72
right

1914.84 --> 1918.34
I don't think it's the other way around

1923.659 --> 1927.8600000000001
back so yeah

1927.98 --> 1934.039
guess what you missed it turret I roll

1931.039 --> 1937.46
out the thermosphere and

1934.039 --> 1940.82
it's even somebody that that try to

1937.46 --> 1943.8400000000001
explain why I didn't understand by straw

1940.82 --> 1943.84
Manning everything I said

1946.76 --> 1950.74
just work on that principle

1951.919 --> 1956.539
pressure differential and then the lower

1954.98 --> 1959.96
pressure next to the higher pressure

1956.539 --> 1962.12
transfer the heat from the pressurized

1959.96 --> 1966.82
yeah that's a good point

1962.12 --> 1966.82
yeah thank you George Sanford

1971.72 --> 1978.32
right so

1974.539 --> 1981.86
even more ridiculous

1978.32 --> 1985.8799999999999
how can something be lower pressure like

1981.86 --> 1988.34
the thermosphere yet be claimed to heat

1985.88 --> 1991.3990000000001
things up a thousand degrees when lower

1988.34 --> 1992.6589999999999
pressure I guess tends to cool things

1991.399 --> 1996.2199999999998
off

1992.659 --> 1996.22
the refrigerator effect

1996.86 --> 2001.779
it's another country I haven't I hadn't

1999.32 --> 2004.24
even directly laid that connection yet

2001.779 --> 2008.039
so thank you for pointing that out guys

2004.24 --> 2008.039
iron 26 George Sanford

2033.76 --> 2041.039
temperature are determined by kinetic

2037.779 --> 2041.039
energy of the what

2041.799 --> 2047.46
proportional

2044.2 --> 2047.46
Okay so

2049.06 --> 2055.24
it it makes no sense though I mean so

2053.139 --> 2058.2000000000003
they're not actually then measuring

2055.24 --> 2058.2
effective temperature

2068.159 --> 2073.08
flat flat O Holy anonymous

2083.5 --> 2086.399
the point is

2086.44 --> 2091.3
why did they have why the hell would

2088.359 --> 2093.7599999999998
they say a thousand degrees

2091.3 --> 2095.3790000000004
when that's obviously completely

2093.76 --> 2098.32
illogical

2095.379 --> 2099.94
like even like within the very nature of

2098.32 --> 2102.94
the gradiation

2099.94 --> 2105.4
that is here

2102.94 --> 2109.359
there is no logical way that there could

2105.4 --> 2113.32
be a layer way up there that's that hot

2109.359 --> 2117.94
there is no logic to it

2113.32 --> 2120.599
yeah temperature is an influence on

2117.94 --> 2120.599
radiation

2123.339 --> 2129.359
if you introduce heat somewhere it's

2125.859 --> 2129.359
going to alter the gradient

2132.94 --> 2137.92
nothing about the thermosphere makes

2136.72 --> 2140.6189999999997
sense

2137.92 --> 2143.6800000000003
there's so many freaking things about it

2140.619 --> 2146.2000000000003
that make no sense in so many directions

2143.68 --> 2148.96
okay

2146.2 --> 2151.4399999999996
that it almost makes gravity look

2148.96 --> 2151.44
logical

2153.52 --> 2158.859
because everything

2156.04 --> 2160.599
physics related

2158.859 --> 2164.14
about the thermosphere is just

2160.599 --> 2167.38
completely insane nothing about it makes

2164.14 --> 2169.18
sense absolutely nothing everything that

2167.38 --> 2171.2200000000003
is claimed about it is complete

2169.18 --> 2174.46
horseshit

2171.22 --> 2176.8199999999997
it doesn't make sense it couldn't make

2174.46 --> 2176.82
sense

2179.2 --> 2187.839
and every explanation you try to draw in

2182.92 --> 2190.2400000000002
to justify it will run at a dead halt

2187.839 --> 2195.18
because you end up trying to claim

2190.24 --> 2195.18
exactly the opposite of how physics work

2195.339 --> 2200.56
it's that ridiculous and that's why I

2197.92 --> 2202.78
call this show the very ill-conceived

2200.56 --> 2205.74
thermosphere because it is very

2202.78 --> 2205.7400000000002
ill-conceived

2214.32 --> 2217.8990000000003
[Music]

2218.88 --> 2225.2400000000002
Connecticut that makes absolutely no

2222.339 --> 2225.24
sense at either

2225.7 --> 2230.64
how the hell are they getting a thousand

2227.619 --> 2234.54
degrees from kinetic energy

2230.64 --> 2234.54
could you elaborate on that

2234.599 --> 2240.78
what is this kinetic energy that adds up

2237.76 --> 2240.78
to a thousand degrees

2244.18 --> 2249.2799999999997
how how is that

2246.339 --> 2251.14
kinetic energy

2249.28 --> 2255.52
there

2251.14 --> 2257.859
what is the kinetic energy is it moving

2255.52 --> 2260.56
I take it kinetic energy is typical

2257.859 --> 2263.0789999999997
movement right so is something the air

2260.56 --> 2265.72
moving around

2263.079 --> 2267.7000000000003
in the thermosphere

2265.72 --> 2272.14
so much

2267.7 --> 2273.8799999999997
that it becomes a thousand degrees worth

2272.14 --> 2276.5989999999997
of energy

2273.88 --> 2280.2400000000002
you know how much

2276.599 --> 2283.54
movement you would need

2280.24 --> 2285.7
to create a thousand degrees worth of

2283.54 --> 2289.54
energy

2285.7 --> 2291.52
how much speed would be involved it's

2289.54 --> 2295.24
ridiculous I mean

2291.52 --> 2297.099
if I argue somehow that oh the connect

2295.24 --> 2299.3199999999997
they measure the kinetic energy adding

2297.099 --> 2303.06
up to a thousand degrees Celsius

2299.32 --> 2305.98
really that much does that mean that the

2303.06 --> 2307.839
thermosphere is basically a Perpetual

2305.98 --> 2309.16
explosion

2307.839 --> 2311.4
right

2309.16 --> 2314.98
it's just

2311.4 --> 2317.26
it's so exploding and moving and kinetic

2314.98 --> 2319.66
that it's big it's the friction of the

2317.26 --> 2321.0400000000004
mirror kinetic energy makes it a

2319.66 --> 2325.44
thousand degrees

2321.04 --> 2325.44
you know how freaking insane that sounds

2326.5 --> 2332.44
have you ever looked at that statement

2330.359 --> 2334.2999999999997
flataholics I'm not trying to shame you

2332.44 --> 2336.76
by the way thank you for bringing it up

2334.3 --> 2338.8590000000004
because you're trying to lay down oh

2336.76 --> 2341.32
this is what they did oh really a

2338.859 --> 2344.16
thousand degrees worth of kinetic energy

2341.32 --> 2345.88
movement

2344.16 --> 2349.5989999999997
justify that

2345.88 --> 2353.6800000000003
there's an air layer a very thin air

2349.599 --> 2355.98
yet the molecules are moving around fast

2353.68 --> 2355.98
enough

2356.4 --> 2364.96
moving around fast enough to add up to a

2360.9 --> 2367.92
thousand degrees Celsius heat that would

2364.96 --> 2367.92
melt gold

2369.339 --> 2375.94
what the [ __ ] do you think is up there

2372.52 --> 2378.579
if you really think that

2375.94 --> 2380.8
I mean that would effectively be like a

2378.579 --> 2382.6600000000003
shield if something would be moving up

2380.8 --> 2385.2400000000002
there so fast to add up to a thousand

2382.66 --> 2388.1189999999997
degrees it would basically be like an

2385.24 --> 2392.5
absolutely impenetrable shield of

2388.119 --> 2396.2400000000002
Perpetual explosive level movement

2392.5 --> 2396.24
nothing about it makes sense

2397.54 --> 2401.619
I may not agree with it dude it makes no

2400.78 --> 2404.92
sense

2401.619 --> 2408.06
why do I have to agree or disagree it

2404.92 --> 2408.06
just makes no sense

2414.339 --> 2420.54
I I'd say it's derived fatally it's it's

2418.48 --> 2425.8
incorrect

2420.54 --> 2427.96
you can [ __ ] off [ __ ] [ __ ] huh huh

2425.8 --> 2430.8390000000004
get the [ __ ] out I don't need your

2427.96 --> 2432.46
[ __ ] little gamma remarks

2430.839 --> 2436.7999999999997
[ __ ]

2432.46 --> 2436.8
so you just get the [ __ ] up

2443.8 --> 2447.6400000000003
yeah

2445.0 --> 2450.7
so it's not about disagreeing it's about

2447.64 --> 2454.66
how do you justify material moving

2450.7 --> 2457.2
around in order to create energy

2454.66 --> 2460.96
of a thousand degrees Celsius

2457.2 --> 2462.7599999999998
like that would be

2460.96 --> 2466.599
air

2462.76 --> 2470.32
thin air moving around so violently it

2466.599 --> 2472.54
would basically make it

2470.32 --> 2475.119
not air

2472.54 --> 2477.46
you wouldn't be able to move past from

2475.119 --> 2479.38
through something that's moving around

2477.46 --> 2481.66
so violently

2479.38 --> 2484.78
that it would add up to a thousand

2481.66 --> 2488.8199999999997
degrees worth of energy

2484.78 --> 2488.82
yeah we're talking about thin air

2489.22 --> 2495.5789999999997
can you even calculate

2492.22 --> 2498.16
air Behavior that would add up to a

2495.579 --> 2501.1800000000003
thousand degrees Celsius it makes no

2498.16 --> 2501.18
[ __ ] sense

2525.04 --> 2527.94
okay

2532.0 --> 2536.16
what are you talking about in Iron 26

2554.92 --> 2558.64
it seems to make sense yeah but it

2557.2 --> 2562.18
doesn't

2558.64 --> 2564.52
and what the [ __ ] are they even doing

2562.18 --> 2568.72
nobody is going there to actually

2564.52 --> 2571.3
confirm that this may this way of

2568.72 --> 2572.3799999999997
measuring things even works at that

2571.3 --> 2575.8
distance

2572.38 --> 2576.76
it's just like p waves and S waves in

2575.8 --> 2579.099
the dirt

2576.76 --> 2581.1400000000003
yeah I mean oh really we can pretty much

2579.099 --> 2584.02
figure out using this technique what's

2581.14 --> 2586.9
down there for like a a hundred meters

2584.02 --> 2590.02
deep pretty cool right yeah yeah so

2586.9 --> 2592.06
let's do this now with the

2590.02 --> 2594.099
seven kilometers

2592.06 --> 2596.68
oh yeah okay well this is what the

2594.099 --> 2598.599
readout said okay let's uh do the cola

2596.68 --> 2602.14
diboro let's let's dig and see what's

2598.599 --> 2605.02
down there oh wait it's completely off

2602.14 --> 2607.06
oh well we are still just gonna assume

2605.02 --> 2609.04
that we can accurately measure at that

2607.06 --> 2611.74
distance right

2609.04 --> 2613.54
what if they never even dug the cola the

2611.74 --> 2616.2999999999997
borehole

2613.54 --> 2618.4
with everybody just assume that p waves

2616.3 --> 2621.04
and S wage would work they would just go

2618.4 --> 2623.859
by what what the moral would roll out

2621.04 --> 2626.5
yeah it seems like that's happening here

2623.859 --> 2628.359
with this thermosphere oh we're just

2626.5 --> 2629.98
scanning it at a distance one this is

2628.359 --> 2632.2
just how it works I mean yeah it works

2629.98 --> 2635.859
pretty accurately close by uh uh sound

2632.2 --> 2638.68
familiar sound familiar huh yeah yeah

2635.859 --> 2641.68
who went there to actually confirm it

2638.68 --> 2641.68
NASA

2642.94 --> 2645.599
really

2646.599 --> 2649.6800000000003
did they even

2650.8 --> 2658.26
what's the deepest we've dug seven miles

2655.18 --> 2658.2599999999998
or something like that

2658.359 --> 2664.18
and yeah and it was completely and

2662.74 --> 2667.66
totally off

2664.18 --> 2670.359
it was so off it was basically like not

2667.66 --> 2673.1189999999997
even a shifted

2670.359 --> 2675.52
data it's like oh we didn't calibrate it

2673.119 --> 2677.92
right now it was just like completely

2675.52 --> 2681.22
different result as to what the scan had

2677.92 --> 2683.5
given it's just completely off

2681.22 --> 2685.48
that's with the p waves and S waves all

2683.5 --> 2687.72
right so if that happens with p waves

2685.48 --> 2691.92
and S waves why would you assume you can

2687.72 --> 2696.22
measure temperature from kinetic energy

2691.92 --> 2697.78
of transparent thin air at a massive

2696.22 --> 2701.16
distance

2697.78 --> 2701.1600000000003
what the [ __ ]

2701.74 --> 2707.02
you have no problem with that

2704.2 --> 2709.359
with believing that that makes any kind

2707.02 --> 2711.22
of logical sense

2709.359 --> 2713.2
oh you have no problem with that oh well

2711.22 --> 2715.54
then you're a [ __ ] you'll just believe

2713.2 --> 2717.2799999999997
whatever stupid little techno Babble

2715.54 --> 2720.2799999999997
[ __ ] you see you're rolling out a

2717.28 --> 2723.52
computer then won't you huh because it

2720.28 --> 2724.9
makes no physical sense

2723.52 --> 2727.3
yeah

2724.9 --> 2729.94
who confirmed it who confirmed the

2727.3 --> 2732.28
physical measurement on location huh

2729.94 --> 2737.56
where where's that registered data

2732.28 --> 2739.1400000000003
where's that Wiki paragraph uh oh it's

2737.56 --> 2740.7999999999997
not there

2739.14 --> 2744.339
oh

2740.8 --> 2747.2200000000003
okay well just assume your stupid little

2744.339 --> 2750.339
techno Babble [ __ ] claims then and

2747.22 --> 2752.52
have no problem with them okay you do

2750.339 --> 2752.52
that

2763.14 --> 2768.5789999999997
yes the kinetic energy

2765.72 --> 2771.339
yes yeah how did you measure that at the

2768.579 --> 2774.6400000000003
distance that kinetic energy or did you

2771.339 --> 2774.64
just assume

2776.079 --> 2780.579
yeah

2777.22 --> 2783.2799999999997
no to just assume it you just calculated

2780.579 --> 2785.7400000000002
it oh we're just gonna calculate oh this

2783.28 --> 2788.079
is the amount of kinetic energy that we

2785.74 --> 2792.2799999999997
assume According to some model [ __ ]

2788.079 --> 2796.0
that it's there so let's calculate how

2792.28 --> 2799.42
much temperature it would be then

2796.0 --> 2801.4
kind of feels like it's that

2799.42 --> 2803.02
they didn't actually measure anything

2801.4 --> 2805.06
that just Unleashed a bunch of

2803.02 --> 2808.079
calculations on presuppositional

2805.06 --> 2808.0789999999997
[ __ ] data

2814.839 --> 2821.319
that's right plethaholics

2818.26 --> 2824.6800000000003
oh there are lots of papers methodology

2821.319 --> 2827.68
results Oh yes any on location

2824.68 --> 2827.68
confirmation

2828.04 --> 2832.619
yeah I because papers are very cute I'd

2831.04 --> 2834.9
like to see

2832.619 --> 2838.6600000000003
the physical

2834.9 --> 2843.04
readout on location

2838.66 --> 2845.5
yeah I don't need Stacks or papers blah

2843.04 --> 2847.7799999999997
blah blah blah blah blah blah math oh

2845.5 --> 2851.319
it's so much math oh yeah the math adds

2847.78 --> 2854.3190000000004
up yeah how about that on location

2851.319 --> 2854.319
measurement

2856.3 --> 2858.96
huh

2861.6 --> 2867.91
[Music]

2878.099 --> 2882.78
clanaholics Anonymous dude I'm mixing it

2881.14 --> 2886.06
up perhaps I don't care

2882.78 --> 2888.52
[Music]

2886.06 --> 2890.5
I'm ranting and get the argument if I

2888.52 --> 2893.319
might mix up names of who's rolling that

2890.5 --> 2896.92
out I'm sorry oh it's so important

2893.319 --> 2899.38
you're so important with feelings

2896.92 --> 2900.88
whatever I'm addressing the argument and

2899.38 --> 2903.42
if both of you are rolling out

2900.88 --> 2907.42
ridiculous

2903.42 --> 2909.94
counter arguments then yeah I probably

2907.42 --> 2911.859
be mixing up your names

2909.94 --> 2915.339
it's what happens when multiple people

2911.859 --> 2918.33
go up against somebody in a debate

2915.339 --> 2923.07
you might mix up the names I'm sorry

2918.33 --> 2923.0699999999997
[Music]

2925.619 --> 2930.579
is the gas constant okay

2930.94 --> 2934.26
it's not confusing at all

2935.619 --> 2939.94
it's the same person okay

2940.119 --> 2944.619
I don't know if it is I don't really

2942.4 --> 2947.76
care if he wants to be two people at the

2944.619 --> 2947.76
same time fine

2948.4 --> 2952.319
I mean I didn't ban the other guy

2959.619 --> 2963.7000000000003
he did leave and then the other

2961.42 --> 2965.619
flataholics did show up but I mean that

2963.7 --> 2968.5789999999997
that's not necessarily proof that

2965.619 --> 2968.579
they're the same person

2968.68 --> 2974.3799999999997
right and there you see here he is again

2971.74 --> 2975.52
ah you said something you broke your

2974.38 --> 2980.2200000000003
word

2975.52 --> 2980.22
your gamma honor is in shambles now

2981.22 --> 2986.64
and yeah gamma honor is oxymoron I know

2988.48 --> 2994.06
enjoying listening oh cool

2991.72 --> 2998.7999999999997
so hey hey

2994.06 --> 3001.21
if you find any information on local

2998.8 --> 3002.4
temperature reading

3001.21 --> 3005.52
[Music]

3002.4 --> 3009.54
in the thermosphere please let me know

3005.52 --> 3011.88
cause I haven't found anything just a

3009.54 --> 3014.64
bunch of [ __ ] maths trying to

3011.88 --> 3018.06
justify taking a temperature measurement

3014.64 --> 3021.0
at a distance of transparent very thin

3018.06 --> 3023.88
air it's moving

3021.0 --> 3028.2
ability like how the [ __ ] are you even

3023.88 --> 3032.78
going to measure at a distance how air

3028.2 --> 3037.14
is moving right kinetic energy moving

3032.78 --> 3039.5400000000004
it's super transparent thin air at a

3037.14 --> 3043.22
distance how the [ __ ]

3039.54 --> 3044.7799999999997
would you measure at a distance

3043.22 --> 3048.56
moving

3044.78 --> 3048.5600000000004
transparent air

3053.66 --> 3057.6189999999997
it makes no sense

3076.46 --> 3081.66
you might be on to something there are

3078.78 --> 3084.1800000000003
in 26 you might be switching

3081.66 --> 3089.42
it's probably just a weirdo

3084.18 --> 3089.4199999999996
multiple personality disorder gamma

3089.7 --> 3093.24
I mean hey if you're gonna keep

3091.22 --> 3095.16
compartmentalizing yourself anonymously

3093.24 --> 3097.819
you're probably gonna split up in

3095.16 --> 3097.819
personality

3098.88 --> 3102.6600000000003
so

3100.02 --> 3105.48
yeah I think you're on to something

3102.66 --> 3108.48
not that as really matters or anything

3105.48 --> 3111.2400000000002
because I mean my argument is the thing

3108.48 --> 3113.839
that is completely destroying

3111.24 --> 3113.839
here

3114.42 --> 3118.099
with no counter arguments

3123.13 --> 3128.579
[Music]

3126.0 --> 3130.92
oh wow

3128.579 --> 3132.059
dude a flataholics Anonymous did you

3130.92 --> 3135.0
know

3132.059 --> 3136.02
that Nathan secretly in his garage has a

3135.0 --> 3137.46
measurement

3136.02 --> 3140.579
that can

3137.46 --> 3143.28
has a device that can measure the

3140.579 --> 3147.2400000000002
concentration of unicorn farts

3143.28 --> 3150.26
at up to a thousand kilometer distance

3147.24 --> 3150.2599999999998
did you know that

3151.079 --> 3156.599
isn't that impressive he has this device

3155.46 --> 3158.819
just

3156.599 --> 3162.48
googly woogly

3158.819 --> 3164.64
unicorn fart measuring device right you

3162.48 --> 3166.68
just aim it

3164.64 --> 3170.0989999999997
admit air

3166.68 --> 3172.6189999999997
and then you say like yeah this is the

3170.099 --> 3175.02
amount of molecules

3172.619 --> 3178.099
per per cubic meter

3175.02 --> 3181.14
of unicorn farts it just reads it out

3178.099 --> 3183.96
isn't that impressive

3181.14 --> 3185.7
isn't that just high tech

3183.96 --> 3187.8
man

3185.7 --> 3189.839
I mean how did it do it it's so

3187.8 --> 3192.42
complicated I couldn't even explain it

3189.839 --> 3195.24
to you but it works really

3192.42 --> 3197.819
it's very accurate

3195.24 --> 3199.9799999999996
allegedly I mean I never really went

3197.819 --> 3202.2599999999998
there or anything to actually figure out

3199.98 --> 3205.859
if there even is such a thing but

3202.26 --> 3211.0400000000004
it works really well though trust me you

3205.859 --> 3211.04
just gotta trust me science or whatever

3216.66 --> 3221.67
okay

3218.49 --> 3221.6699999999996
[Music]

3224.7 --> 3227.18
right

3228.24 --> 3235.14
so it's really cool oh man we can we can

3231.319 --> 3237.359
measure moving transparent things at a

3235.14 --> 3238.5589999999997
fast distance we're so accurate at it oh

3237.359 --> 3240.9
wow

3238.559 --> 3242.76
that's cool

3240.9 --> 3244.26
can you prove it

3242.76 --> 3246.059
can you prove that you're actually

3244.26 --> 3247.559
measuring some of the movement of

3246.059 --> 3248.52
something that's transparent at a

3247.559 --> 3253.619
distance

3248.52 --> 3256.619
could you demonstrate that here on Earth

3253.619 --> 3259.319
that'll be cool if you could like aim it

3256.619 --> 3262.2000000000003
horizontally on gas or something and

3259.319 --> 3265.5
then actually measure its kinetic energy

3262.2 --> 3267.96
and then have I don't know posts or

3265.5 --> 3270.3
whatever on location to confirm with it

3267.96 --> 3273.119
or even if that kinetic movement of the

3270.3 --> 3275.88
air huh let's see if it actually even

3273.119 --> 3278.94
does anything it just sounds like

3275.88 --> 3282.26
[ __ ] technobabble bro it's just

3278.94 --> 3282.26
technobabble to me

3282.9 --> 3288.119
it doesn't mean anything

3286.02 --> 3291.48
oh we can measure it at a distance oh

3288.119 --> 3293.52
really the did you actually prove that

3291.48 --> 3296.059
you can do that

3293.52 --> 3296.059
really

3319.339 --> 3327.02
are you some freaking Google bot to

3323.22 --> 3327.02
reinforce nonsense information

3328.02 --> 3335.0
are you a propaganda AI

3331.559 --> 3335.0
flataholics anonymous

3336.72 --> 3343.3799999999997
are you just a propagandist because you

3340.2 --> 3345.72
seem to be reinforcing this [ __ ] you

3343.38 --> 3346.92
haven't delivered a single piece of

3345.72 --> 3350.2799999999997
evidence

3346.92 --> 3353.119
only claims no this this device does it

3350.28 --> 3353.119
oh really

3353.28 --> 3359.059
you haven't delivered anything you're

3355.5 --> 3359.059
just making more claims

3359.579 --> 3364.8590000000004
yeah you're not justifying the claims

3362.579 --> 3367.1400000000003
you're just making more [ __ ] claims

3364.859 --> 3369.42
oh we have a device that that confirmed

3367.14 --> 3371.46
it oh yeah yeah sure yeah how how is

3369.42 --> 3374.16
that possible it really works oh cool

3371.46 --> 3377.4
man how do you know it really works oh

3374.16 --> 3380.64
because you're just buying it you're

3377.4 --> 3382.92
just swallowing it all you're just

3380.64 --> 3385.52
trusting the [ __ ]

3382.92 --> 3385.52
okay

3387.839 --> 3393.119
right otherwise I'd like to see some

3390.839 --> 3397.339
confirmation that you can even

3393.119 --> 3401.099
measure kinetic energy of transparent

3397.339 --> 3402.96
gaseous substance at a distance that

3401.099 --> 3404.819
would be really cool

3402.96 --> 3408.2400000000002
to see

3404.819 --> 3408.96
that they actually proved they can do

3408.24 --> 3411.839
that

3408.96 --> 3414.0
that would be very cool I mean I bet you

3411.839 --> 3417.42
can measure kinetic energy unlike an

3414.0 --> 3419.76
object like oh you oh there's a plane

3417.42 --> 3422.04
moving there oh quickly aim the thing oh

3419.76 --> 3424.8590000000004
you're measuring it oh you have the

3422.04 --> 3427.079
speed in relation to the Earth and then

3424.859 --> 3430.0789999999997
you can calculate the kinetic energy

3427.079 --> 3434.78
because of the speed right

3430.079 --> 3434.78
yeah this is one thing though about that

3436.2 --> 3442.0789999999997
it's a solid thing

3438.66 --> 3444.0589999999997
and it's not transparent yeah so yeah

3442.079 --> 3447.059
you can do that well that's really cool

3444.059 --> 3449.2200000000003
yeah yeah now try that same thing

3447.059 --> 3451.94
with gas

3449.22 --> 3455.0989999999997
that is transparent yeah go and

3451.94 --> 3457.14
calculate the motion how the [ __ ] are

3455.099 --> 3459.839
you even reading the motion of something

3457.14 --> 3461.64
that's a gaseous and transparent you

3459.839 --> 3462.72
[ __ ] idiot have you even thought of

3461.64 --> 3466.52
this

3462.72 --> 3466.52
nothing about that makes sense

3467.64 --> 3470.48
makes no sense

3479.22 --> 3485.5989999999997
am I your rate of collision yeah but how

3481.8 --> 3485.599
are you detecting it

3488.78 --> 3495.2400000000002
how the [ __ ] are you measuring something

3491.64 --> 3498.92
that's transparent and has no

3495.24 --> 3498.9199999999996
intermolecular bonds

3499.02 --> 3503.7599999999998
how the [ __ ] are you going to measure

3501.54 --> 3508.319
that at a distance how do you know what

3503.76 --> 3510.2400000000002
you're even aiming at it's transparent

3508.319 --> 3515.72
it's gas

3510.24 --> 3515.72
nothing about this makes sense you idiot

3526.619 --> 3530.94
hose grass pressure measured through

3528.839 --> 3534.0
container walls

3530.94 --> 3537.319
and then comparing one piece of

3534.0 --> 3541.98
pressurized container to another

3537.319 --> 3544.079
pressurized container which is the realm

3541.98 --> 3546.68
yeah you compare pressures that's how

3544.079 --> 3546.6800000000003
it's measured

3554.94 --> 3558.359
is there any relevance to asking that

3556.92 --> 3561.54
question

3558.359 --> 3563.4
gonna ask some more [ __ ] rudimentary

3561.54 --> 3565.74
questions about things that aren't

3563.4 --> 3567.599
directly involved in in this argument

3565.74 --> 3570.5
that we're having about this supposed

3567.599 --> 3570.5
thermosphere

3577.5 --> 3584.46
oh my God

3580.619 --> 3587.119
no no you no you're not seriously saying

3584.46 --> 3591.68
that that is

3587.119 --> 3591.6800000000003
that is beyond rumpus

3592.46 --> 3597.92
oh stupidity hurts it hurts

3598.319 --> 3601.319
ah

3601.4 --> 3607.559
individual gas particles have mass that

3604.68 --> 3610.5
can be detected you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3611.88 --> 3617.0
I cannot believe you actually set that

3614.339 --> 3617.0
[ __ ]

3627.839 --> 3633.18
okay okay mountains luck master I guess

3630.96 --> 3635.64
that you are no longer part of my

3633.18 --> 3637.6189999999997

3635.64 --> 3640.0789999999997
your comment was

3637.619 --> 3643.079
actually constructive but it seems

3640.079 --> 3645.54
you're just a arwin-hating gamma [ __ ]

3643.079 --> 3648.059
now so I guess it's [ __ ] off for you

3645.54 --> 3650.94
then forever

3648.059 --> 3653.0400000000004
to go back to your gamma hives and whine

3650.94 --> 3655.92
and wank there

3653.04 --> 3658.2
slug Master yeah because I'm having a

3655.92 --> 3660.1800000000003
pretty good debate here

3658.2 --> 3663.66
we're making a good argument and I'm

3660.18 --> 3665.94
watching troll idiots squirm

3663.66 --> 3668.52
with a complete lack of proof or

3665.94 --> 3672.619
argumentation

3668.52 --> 3672.619
you however I don't need anymore

3672.72 --> 3679.319
yeah because I'm on a roll

3675.299 --> 3681.96
and my communications here are very much

3679.319 --> 3684.72
Justified

3681.96 --> 3687.799
so you can get the [ __ ] out

3684.72 --> 3687.799
and don't come back

3699.72 --> 3704.18
are you saying gas is momentum no it

3702.0 --> 3704.18
doesn't

3704.46 --> 3712.319
and why the hell would iron 26 say that

3709.26 --> 3715.0400000000004
what are you dude I'm gonna get you the

3712.319 --> 3718.079
[ __ ] out of my show man you are just

3715.04 --> 3721.2
rolling out one straw man [ __ ]

3718.079 --> 3723.3590000000004
assumption about us after the other I'm

3721.2 --> 3725.22
kind of [ __ ] done with this [ __ ]

3723.359 --> 3727.5
you're not even addressing anything

3725.22 --> 3729.0789999999997
about the thermosphere anymore you're

3727.5 --> 3732.299
just

3729.079 --> 3735.38
whining and dragging out

3732.299 --> 3735.38
this is ridiculous

3740.78 --> 3745.559
oh there's some more complaints yeah why

3743.819 --> 3747.66
don't you have a [ __ ] argument then

3745.559 --> 3749.28
[ __ ]

3747.66 --> 3750.24
why don't you have a [ __ ] argument

3749.28 --> 3751.8590000000004
then

3750.24 --> 3754.14
yeah

3751.859 --> 3757.2
you don't have one

3754.14 --> 3760.14
oh these batting people oh yeah because

3757.2 --> 3762.299
I have an argument and you don't you

3760.14 --> 3767.339
have a claim however

3762.299 --> 3770.099
and I have arguments against that claim

3767.339 --> 3773.839
and then you roll out counter arguments

3770.099 --> 3773.839
that make no freaking sense

3774.059 --> 3781.8590000000004
and that are not actually physically on

3778.559 --> 3784.8590000000004
location confirmed and nobody is doing

3781.859 --> 3787.619
that none of you are actually showing me

3784.859 --> 3789.66
oh yeah here's that actual test where

3787.619 --> 3792.0
they on location confirm the temperature

3789.66 --> 3795.0
yeah yeah nobody's doing that yeah

3792.0 --> 3797.16
nobody you're just trusting the device

3795.0 --> 3799.5
oh it could really do that oh yes

3797.16 --> 3804.299
there's a device and it can measure the

3799.5 --> 3805.64
kinetic energy of transparent gas at a

3804.299 --> 3809.22
distance

3805.64 --> 3813.66
yes believe us we can do that we can

3809.22 --> 3816.9599999999996
measure the movement of something that

3813.66 --> 3820.319
is transparent and has no intermolecular

3816.96 --> 3822.9
bonds at a vast distance you'll just

3820.319 --> 3824.579
have to trust us on that that it works

3822.9 --> 3827.099
really

3824.579 --> 3830.04
and then not gonna explain how that

3827.099 --> 3832.8590000000004
would work because if you did

3830.04 --> 3835.14
we'd probably figure out very quickly

3832.859 --> 3836.819
that there was no measurement involved

3835.14 --> 3841.5
it's just a bunch of presuppositional

3836.819 --> 3843.619
[ __ ] calculations which it always is

3841.5 --> 3843.619
yeah

3844.079 --> 3848.04
foreign

3845.78 --> 3851.52
there is no evidence for the

3848.04 --> 3854.119
thermosphere it is a very ill-conceived

3851.52 --> 3854.119
concept

3855.29 --> 3863.18
[Music]

3860.819 --> 3866.7599999999998
located

3863.18 --> 3868.68
expansion pressure yeah pressure is a

3866.76 --> 3872.2200000000003
force

3868.68 --> 3874.2599999999998
doesn't need Mass to create pressure it

3872.22 --> 3876.0
just needs pressure

3874.26 --> 3878.1600000000003
huh

3876.0 --> 3881.16
it's an equilibrium with its surrounding

3878.16 --> 3883.74
yeah but I'm not gonna go there you see

3881.16 --> 3887.16
I'm not doing that because you're trying

3883.74 --> 3890.0989999999997
to lead the conversation away from the

3887.16 --> 3894.8999999999996
very ill-conceived concept of the

3890.099 --> 3897.839
thermosphere which you are dead stuck in

3894.9 --> 3901.38
so you could try to worm around with

3897.839 --> 3903.72
your technobabble [ __ ] straw man

3901.38 --> 3906.839
arguments that aren't arguments and just

3903.72 --> 3908.3999999999996
moving away moving away from the very

3906.839 --> 3909.599
ill-conceived concept of the

3908.4 --> 3913.7400000000002
thermosphere

3909.599 --> 3916.6800000000003
yeah but I'm not gonna let you move the

3913.74 --> 3920.72
conversation away

3916.68 --> 3920.72
from it you see

3924.9 --> 3929.52
hello by the way Richard trying not to

3927.54 --> 3932.7799999999997
be there good to see you you're getting

3929.52 --> 3932.78
a wrench because you're awesome

3940.2 --> 3944.339
certainly triggering a whole bunch of

3942.18 --> 3948.66
[ __ ] today

3944.339 --> 3953.0589999999997
what a bunch of miniing [ __ ] wankers

3948.66 --> 3953.0589999999997
keyboard Warrior losers

3957.92 --> 3963.42
I made my series cheering you we already

3962.099 --> 3966.6600000000003
lost

3963.42 --> 3968.76
oh lost all that heat production and the

3966.66 --> 3971.8799999999997
electricity bills going up don't take my

3968.76 --> 3974.46
thermosphere at least in my imagination

3971.88 --> 3978.299
I just wanted that free unexplicable

3974.46 --> 3980.52
heat of gas don't take my thermosphere

3978.299 --> 3982.04
I'll feel colder now

3980.52 --> 3985.74
peace

3982.04 --> 3988.859
don't take my thermosphere I need the

3985.74 --> 3990.9599999999996
conceptual heat for some reason so I

3988.859 --> 3993.5389999999998
could just imagine how it's warm

3990.96 --> 3996.78
somewhere really

3993.539 --> 3998.579
we need it we don't know why we need the

3996.78 --> 4001.579
thermosphere but we need it because

3998.579 --> 4004.6400000000003
we're told that it's there so we have to

4001.579 --> 4006.2000000000003
then make a [ __ ] excuses as to why

4004.64 --> 4007.819
it's there even though there's no

4006.2 --> 4009.5
confirmation that it even is there

4007.819 --> 4012.64
because it's not been physically

4009.5 --> 4012.64
measured on location

4012.68 --> 4016.24
you [ __ ] [ __ ]

4025.82 --> 4030.88
[Music]

4043.9 --> 4048.319
ah yeah hey what where what where yeah

4047.059 --> 4050.299
yeah yeah

4048.319 --> 4053.42
just

4050.299 --> 4056.5389999999998
don't try to move away yeah

4053.42 --> 4059.0
don't harass the people in my chat why

4056.539 --> 4062.96
did you just address what I asked you

4059.0 --> 4065.599
huh where's the physical on location

4062.96 --> 4069.5
measurement

4065.599 --> 4072.619
to confirm that assumed to be

4069.5 --> 4074.96
temperature ah where is it then huh you

4072.619 --> 4077.599
numpty [ __ ] why don't you keep

4074.96 --> 4080.539
twirling around in your butt of stinky

4077.599 --> 4082.88
soup some more move around more straw

4080.539 --> 4084.619
man let's move away let's bicker with

4082.88 --> 4087.44
somebody else about some other detail

4084.619 --> 4090.1400000000003
that's not involved in that huh

4087.44 --> 4092.7200000000003
yeah cowardly piece of [ __ ]

4090.14 --> 4095.18
why'd you [ __ ] address the the actual

4092.72 --> 4097.2789999999995
concept of the show today huh you

4095.18 --> 4100.16
[ __ ]

4097.279 --> 4102.679
huh I don't know much yeah I know you

4100.16 --> 4104.799
don't know much about it yeah I know you

4102.679 --> 4104.799
don't

4115.66 --> 4122.0199999999995
you're really eager to argue it though

4118.699 --> 4122.0199999999995
at the start huh

4122.259 --> 4127.58
flataholics

4124.04 --> 4130.699
is just eager to straw man away

4127.58 --> 4133.339
get bickering with iron 26 going right

4130.699 --> 4135.98
bickering is a great way to distract

4133.339 --> 4138.5
yourself from the realization of the

4135.98 --> 4139.94
humiliation of trying to defend

4138.5 --> 4141.92
something that you literally don't even

4139.94 --> 4144.3189999999995
know what the [ __ ] you're talking about

4141.92 --> 4146.4800000000005
it's a good way to start bickering about

4144.319 --> 4147.799
all their details with people in the

4146.48 --> 4151.0
chat it's a good way to distract

4147.799 --> 4153.799
yourself from that painful humiliation

4151.0 --> 4155.6
of the realization you've been trying to

4153.799 --> 4157.759
argue something that you literally don't

4155.6 --> 4161.660000000001
even understand

4157.759 --> 4164.259
huh I know what that's like seeing it

4161.66 --> 4164.259
happen a lot

4165.62 --> 4169.4
because yeah it sucks if you actually

4167.719 --> 4171.319
tried to defend something and then you

4169.4 --> 4173.96
turn out to be completely wrong you have

4171.319 --> 4176.0
to have some inkling an ability

4173.96 --> 4180.5
something that you have to train in your

4176.0 --> 4182.839
life of humility where you realize

4180.5 --> 4184.819
oh [ __ ] it wasn't what I thought it was

4182.839 --> 4187.16
I was wrong yeah that's kind of

4184.819 --> 4189.1990000000005
embarrassing how can I fix this hmm

4187.16 --> 4190.639999999999
let's figure it out let's correct this

4189.199 --> 4194.0599999999995
yeah yeah that's what you should be

4190.64 --> 4198.860000000001
doing not you said this word wrong oh

4194.06 --> 4201.620000000001
you don't even understand gas pressure

4198.86 --> 4204.739
yeah yeah that's called distracting away

4201.62 --> 4207.28
from your humiliation

4204.739 --> 4207.28
hmm

4210.52 --> 4215.2390000000005
foreign

4212.42 --> 4216.92
after I Recon believe it or not yeah

4215.239 --> 4221.139999999999
well guess what I'm not gonna believe it

4216.92 --> 4225.02
because there's no on location physical

4221.14 --> 4228.38
measurement to confirm this assertion

4225.02 --> 4230.2390000000005
about your device that's claimed to be

4228.38 --> 4234.62
able to measure

4230.239 --> 4237.98
the kinetic energy of transparent thin

4234.62 --> 4240.86
gas at a vast distance which is

4237.98 --> 4242.839999999999
absolutely ridiculous

4240.86 --> 4244.099999999999
to even

4242.84 --> 4246.1990000000005
say

4244.1 --> 4248.38
that you have a device that could do

4246.199 --> 4248.379999999999
that

4249.02 --> 4255.4400000000005
yeah absolutely ridiculous

4252.56 --> 4258.7390000000005
like it's ridiculous if you believe that

4255.44 --> 4260.96
that's possible you're [ __ ]

4258.739 --> 4263.299999999999
how the [ __ ] can you even measure

4260.96 --> 4266.36
movement of something that's transparent

4263.3 --> 4269.679
and has no intermolecular bonds

4266.36 --> 4269.679
it's idiotic

4270.14 --> 4274.1
it's like oh yeah we figured out a

4271.94 --> 4277.099999999999
device that could actually measure Dark

4274.1 --> 4279.56
Matter oh yes yes we finally did it

4277.1 --> 4281.719
science has gone that far we can finally

4279.56 --> 4284.06
measure dark matter

4281.719 --> 4285.92
you have a dark measure it is it

4284.06 --> 4289.219
measurable yeah but we could do it

4285.92 --> 4292.76
really it's just like we just aim it and

4289.219 --> 4296.179
it just just measures the the movement

4292.76 --> 4297.7390000000005
of the black body or some blah blah blah

4296.179 --> 4299.54
[ __ ] yeah yeah we were just

4297.739 --> 4301.759999999999
measuring it oh yeah yeah

4299.54 --> 4305.06
oh oh okay oh yeah we're just gonna

4301.76 --> 4307.280000000001
believe that yeah yeah or it makes

4305.06 --> 4309.4400000000005
absolutely no sense

4307.28 --> 4312.86
how the [ __ ] can you move

4309.44 --> 4316.099999999999
out of [ __ ] can you measure something

4312.86 --> 4319.5199999999995
that's transparent

4316.1 --> 4321.860000000001
has no intermolecular bonds

4319.52 --> 4324.56
right there's no contrast there's no

4321.86 --> 4326.659
nothing to reflect upon

4324.56 --> 4328.580000000001
how can you measure something that's

4326.659 --> 4330.92
transparent

4328.58 --> 4332.54
and has no intermolecular bonds at a

4330.92 --> 4334.58
distance how can you measure the motion

4332.54 --> 4338.0
of that it makes sense

4334.58 --> 4340.9
makes no sense why can't you see that it

4338.0 --> 4340.9
makes no sense

4342.54 --> 4352.78
[Music]

4349.719 --> 4352.78
thank you

4365.62 --> 4370.46
uh right anyway

4368.48 --> 4372.759999999999
I'm on a roll today at least with this

4370.46 --> 4372.76
subject

4375.98 --> 4380.0
I really think I got something here

4377.659 --> 4383.0599999999995
because I do

4380.0 --> 4386.06
this is an issue and trolls and chat

4383.06 --> 4388.1
trolls scammas Ballers they're proving

4386.06 --> 4390.92
that it is

4388.1 --> 4394.159000000001
because they're dead stuck

4390.92 --> 4396.08
with their arguments that stuck

4394.159 --> 4397.46
there's nothing they can do straw man

4396.08 --> 4400.58
away

4397.46 --> 4403.699
complain about me

4400.58 --> 4405.679
not listening or Banning people and they

4403.699 --> 4407.78
could go [ __ ] themselves

4405.679 --> 4410.2390000000005
just make it more about raqqa it's more

4407.78 --> 4413.3
about complaining then you don't have to

4410.239 --> 4415.58
be so distracted by the

4413.3 --> 4417.7390000000005
humiliation

4415.58 --> 4421.179
of trying to defend something that makes

4417.739 --> 4421.178999999999
absolutely no sense

4429.34 --> 4433.46
yeah yeah of course you don't want to

4431.42 --> 4436.6990000000005
get into it because there isn't anything

4433.46 --> 4439.34
to get into it's horseshit everything

4436.699 --> 4443.839999999999
about this thermosphere and how it's

4439.34 --> 4447.62
established has all been taken under the

4443.84 --> 4451.400000000001
loop today on my show every part of it

4447.62 --> 4455.719
and it's complete horse [ __ ]

4451.4 --> 4458.739
nothing has been measured nothing

4455.719 --> 4462.7390000000005
it's all calculated

4458.739 --> 4462.739
preconceived [ __ ]

4467.62 --> 4470.659
[Music]

4471.56 --> 4476.3
right so yeah stay out of it you do that

4474.56 --> 4479.4400000000005
you're not gonna help yourself by

4476.3 --> 4479.4400000000005
getting into it now

4479.96 --> 4485.2390000000005
besides you have nothing to offer there

4482.9 --> 4487.4
is no counter argument if there was such

4485.239 --> 4489.799999999999
a thing you'd be posting it right now

4487.4 --> 4491.12
and you wouldn't be oh I don't really

4489.8 --> 4492.679
want to talk about yeah that's because

4491.12 --> 4494.599999999999
you have nothing to talk about you have

4492.679 --> 4497.1990000000005
no arguments so of course you don't want

4494.6 --> 4497.1990000000005
to bring that up

4498.94 --> 4503.719
talking to you Orinoco Wambo talking to

4502.58 --> 4506.179
you now

4503.719 --> 4509.12
before this I was talking

4506.179 --> 4512.4800000000005
to Flat the horlicks anonymous

4509.12 --> 4514.34
and who what where and now you started

4512.48 --> 4517.839999999999
to roll in

4514.34 --> 4517.84
so I'm talking to you now

4522.38 --> 4528.76
to think about it what

4525.62 --> 4528.76
I'm talking about

4532.04 --> 4539.26
oh wait he said he's more what

4535.34 --> 4539.26
oh you were responding to somebody else

4539.42 --> 4544.96
okay yeah sorry I did mix that up sorry

4542.48 --> 4544.959999999999
about that

4545.78 --> 4551.599999999999
I'm just kind of ready to

4548.36 --> 4555.0199999999995
tear Ballers apart here because they've

4551.6 --> 4556.88
been rolling out such [ __ ] rebuttals

4555.02 --> 4559.34
and I was kind of assuming that you were

4556.88 --> 4562.28
doing that or not doing it and then

4559.34 --> 4565.12
doing it anyway but you were addressing

4562.28 --> 4565.12
tarot sorry

4567.02 --> 4569.56
thank you

4599.36 --> 4601.54
thank you

4603.26 --> 4608.719
okay I'm 26 what are you talking about

4606.04 --> 4611.8
so you're you're taking it to another

4608.719 --> 4611.8
subject are you

4612.14 --> 4614.7390000000005
what

4619.219 --> 4624.9800000000005
oh wait that's a I did I overlooked that

4622.58 --> 4627.5599999999995
post that you said there

4624.98 --> 4631.218999999999
from five minutes ago that's a good one

4627.56 --> 4633.56
hydrogen octal ignition temperature

4631.219 --> 4635.8
spontaneous technician in air 500

4633.56 --> 4635.8
Degrees

4636.98 --> 4644.419999999999
right but there is technically though

4641.179 --> 4648.34
an issue because it's it's there's no

4644.42 --> 4648.34
Oxygen there to ignite it

4648.679 --> 4653.719
right it can't burn

4650.96 --> 4655.04
because there's no Oxygen there

4653.719 --> 4658.34
right

4655.04 --> 4659.96
the spontaneous ignition is under the

4658.34 --> 4663.5
condition that there's oxygen around

4659.96 --> 4664.88
which at ground level there always is

4663.5 --> 4667.699
right

4664.88 --> 4670.36
but I mean hydrogen can't ignite without

4667.699 --> 4670.36
oxygen

4674.719 --> 4676.9
thank you

4686.0 --> 4690.44
yeah Ariana that's not yeah if you want

4688.58 --> 4693.199
to talk about that [ __ ] it's not my

4690.44 --> 4695.36
problem dude I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

4693.199 --> 4697.4
bicker about you with me about medical

4695.36 --> 4698.599999999999
experimentations

4697.4 --> 4701.36
okay

4698.6 --> 4704.3
I talked about that yesterday talked

4701.36 --> 4706.5199999999995
about it pretty elaborately I'd say

4704.3 --> 4708.9800000000005
what what more is there to talk about

4706.52 --> 4710.84
yeah I mean if you want to know the

4708.98 --> 4712.218999999999
details of the risks of what you've done

4710.84 --> 4714.26
then

4712.219 --> 4716.719
what you don't that

4714.26 --> 4718.84
okay this is getting confusing now tear

4716.719 --> 4718.84
it

4719.42 --> 4724.179
uh you're making it confusing

4734.239 --> 4737.239
all right because I'm not gonna talk

4735.92 --> 4739.219
about that again I talked about that

4737.239 --> 4741.459999999999
yesterday it's good enough

4739.219 --> 4745.04
right

4741.46 --> 4747.38
and I mean if you really want to talk

4745.04 --> 4749.78
about such things well there's like a

4747.38 --> 4752.0
hundred thousand channels out there that

4749.78 --> 4754.58
are talking about nothing else

4752.0 --> 4756.98
maybe not a hundred thousand but a lot

4754.58 --> 4758.84
of people talking about it and like

4756.98 --> 4761.659
alternative doctors they're doing a

4758.84 --> 4763.52
whole me media thing

4761.659 --> 4766.219
from the alternative perspective against

4763.52 --> 4768.080000000001
the medical experimentation right and

4766.219 --> 4770.06
they've basically dedicated their lives

4768.08 --> 4772.699
to it and they have like medical

4770.06 --> 4775.04
research background more in detail and

4772.699 --> 4778.699
you could go there

4775.04 --> 4784.159
I just know what I know

4778.699 --> 4787.5199999999995
right viruses are not real like at all

4784.159 --> 4788.679
there's a lot of weird stuff concerning

4787.52 --> 4791.900000000001
medical

4788.679 --> 4793.219
details that have been like a cover

4791.9 --> 4795.0199999999995
story

4793.219 --> 4797.38
and I think that viruses are a cover

4795.02 --> 4797.38
story

4800.179 --> 4805.52
and they're just there to kind of make

4802.28 --> 4808.58
it to create a psychological incentive

4805.52 --> 4812.659000000001
basically because people do easily

4808.58 --> 4815.36
believe in them you see

4812.659 --> 4817.159
apparently it's been relatively easy to

4815.36 --> 4820.12
make people believe in something that

4817.159 --> 4820.12
they cannot see

4821.78 --> 4827.12
if they just believe it's there then to

4824.84 --> 4829.34
them it's there and that seems to be the

4827.12 --> 4831.8
primary function I think that viruses as

4829.34 --> 4833.06
a concept it was is really psychological

4831.8 --> 4835.9400000000005
warfare

4833.06 --> 4838.9400000000005
and it is actually

4835.94 --> 4841.82
based

4838.94 --> 4844.639999999999
um like a mind virus the thing is though

4841.82 --> 4847.58
that the whole word of that

4844.64 --> 4849.860000000001
was derived from the concepts it's kind

4847.58 --> 4851.3
of complicated right I mean even our way

4849.86 --> 4854.86
of thinking

4851.3 --> 4858.4400000000005
and the descriptions of that have been

4854.86 --> 4860.96
melt yeah it viruses have been

4858.44 --> 4863.659
integrated with ways of thinking

4860.96 --> 4866.38
going viral right

4863.659 --> 4866.379999999999
yeah

4866.84 --> 4873.159000000001
but the origin concept is just

4869.54 --> 4873.159
completely made up [ __ ]

4876.62 --> 4882.679
so there's an entire conception and way

4879.8 --> 4883.76
of thinking that based on the idea of

4882.679 --> 4886.3
viruses

4883.76 --> 4890.54
that is like culturally spread around

4886.3 --> 4894.56
but the origin is completely made up

4890.54 --> 4897.56
like ideas spread as viruses right or

4894.56 --> 4900.56
ideas just spread as ideas

4897.56 --> 4902.54
right

4900.56 --> 4904.159000000001
but

4902.54 --> 4905.96
that doesn't really work if you say

4904.159 --> 4907.28
ideas spreads like a virus then

4905.96 --> 4909.86
everybody understands even though

4907.28 --> 4911.86
viruses literally don't exist and the

4909.86 --> 4915.58
things that they say viruses do

4911.86 --> 4915.58
literally don't happen

4915.679 --> 4922.4
so we rest like subconscious

4919.0 --> 4925.699
understanding about processes

4922.4 --> 4928.04
we name it after something that

4925.699 --> 4930.379999999999
literally doesn't exist like how the

4928.04 --> 4933.4
hell did we end up there

4930.38 --> 4933.400000000001
how did this happen

4935.179 --> 4942.9400000000005
our cultural understanding is getting

4937.6 --> 4942.9400000000005
anchored in things that don't exist

4944.78 --> 4950.599999999999
we use the word atmosphere in a variety

4947.78 --> 4953.3099999999995
of way it's based on something that

4950.6 --> 4955.659000000001
literally doesn't exist

4953.31 --> 4959.6
[Music]

4955.659 --> 4961.759999999999
not that air doesn't take the shape of a

4959.6 --> 4963.8
sphere I mean why didn't they call it

4961.76 --> 4966.08
the atmos Cube

4963.8 --> 4968.360000000001
is that much more likely that it's a

4966.08 --> 4971.08
cube because the container is sort of

4968.36 --> 4971.08
cube shape

4972.44 --> 4977.48
or if you're a disc earther with a dome

4974.78 --> 4980.3
then call it the atmos Dome because it's

4977.48 --> 4982.718999999999
gonna then be dumb [ __ ] isn't it on the

4980.3 --> 4982.719
Flat Earth

4982.76 --> 4987.38
but no atmosphere what's the atmosphere

4985.34 --> 4990.04
here well they have a little friction

4987.38 --> 4992.56
area oh so we're using that word

4990.04 --> 4996.62
atmosphere again

4992.56 --> 4999.92
for describing feelings how the hell did

4996.62 --> 5003.82
we end up there why do we describe

4999.92 --> 5006.76
things using words based on things that

5003.82 --> 5009.639999999999
literally don't exist why do we do that

5006.76 --> 5014.02
to ourselves collectively

5009.64 --> 5018.58
is that Satan and crouching up on our

5014.02 --> 5022.3
ratio on our actual rational thinking

5018.58 --> 5024.88
to just may start making us use words

5022.3 --> 5027.46
that are based on nothing and then we

5024.88 --> 5029.6990000000005
think it actually means something

5027.46 --> 5029.699
foreign

5038.679 --> 5043.1990000000005
why they didn't call it sphere

5044.199 --> 5048.099999999999
why the hell would I blame the ancient

5045.88 --> 5050.14
Greeks

5048.1 --> 5052.120000000001
they weren't even half as [ __ ] as

5050.14 --> 5054.219
people these days

5052.12 --> 5056.679
Greeks would never stand for that kind

5054.219 --> 5058.84
of [ __ ] you would have to literally

5056.679 --> 5061.12
imprison somebody make them a slave and

5058.84 --> 5064.06
put them in a cave to get them that

5061.12 --> 5066.699
deranged yeah

5064.06 --> 5068.8
you have to literally enslave somebody

5066.699 --> 5071.799999999999
and break their mind to make them

5068.8 --> 5075.219
believe that okay now

5071.8 --> 5078.159000000001
people just break their own mind

5075.219 --> 5080.14
by their because there's only people

5078.159 --> 5082.0
with broken Minds that are around them

5080.14 --> 5084.52
and so then they think that having a

5082.0 --> 5086.14
broken mind is the default and then they

5084.52 --> 5089.5
break their mind so people break their

5086.14 --> 5092.679
own minds now yeah back then people

5089.5 --> 5095.38
wouldn't be they would die for their

5092.679 --> 5098.38
sanity okay they would die for their

5095.38 --> 5101.26
sanity the Greeks they would die for

5098.38 --> 5103.84
their convictions for their sanity for

5101.26 --> 5105.219
their honor yeah I don't see people now

5103.84 --> 5107.46
doing that

5105.219 --> 5107.46
foreign

5128.35 --> 5133.06
[Music]

5130.0 --> 5136.84
yeah they didn't use the word atmosphere

5133.06 --> 5138.219
yeah atmosphere is a constructed word

5136.84 --> 5139.84
Atmos

5138.219 --> 5143.86
sphere

5139.84 --> 5146.14
those words I'm sure the Greek had them

5143.86 --> 5149.199
yeah but they didn't put them together

5146.14 --> 5152.46
into atmosphere yeah that's something

5149.199 --> 5156.78
that modern people did

5152.46 --> 5156.78
with that old language

5159.58 --> 5164.739
so why don't you go dig up the track

5162.699 --> 5166.0599999999995
record for the use of the word

5164.739 --> 5168.239
atmosphere

5166.06 --> 5172.4400000000005
I'll bet you

5168.239 --> 5178.739
it was conceived and started to get used

5172.44 --> 5181.659
way way after the printing press yeah

5178.739 --> 5185.08
atmosphere is a young word

5181.659 --> 5187.719
I'd say 19th century but it's wet finger

5185.08 --> 5189.46
work I'm not sure but a lot of these

5187.719 --> 5192.28
types of words were conceived in the

5189.46 --> 5195.34
19th century reconstructed history was

5192.28 --> 5196.48
rearranged in the 19th century a lot n

5195.34 --> 5198.46
words

5196.48 --> 5200.94
so I I would bet that the word

5198.46 --> 5204.159
atmosphere was basically

5200.94 --> 5205.48
conceived and popularized in the 19th

5204.159 --> 5206.679
century but it might have been before

5205.48 --> 5209.08
that

5206.679 --> 5210.58
might be during Newton's time even I'm

5209.08 --> 5215.32
not sure

5210.58 --> 5218.4
but I do know is that the Greeks of

5215.32 --> 5221.92
ancient times didn't use the word

5218.4 --> 5226.239
atmosphere okay

5221.92 --> 5229.0
they'd say air Atmos diatma

5226.239 --> 5232.12
and it's a sphere hey look an object

5229.0 --> 5234.46
that is geometrically is fair yeah sure

5232.12 --> 5238.08
they they probably use that

5234.46 --> 5241.12
what they didn't say was the atmosphere

5238.08 --> 5243.46
the body of air

5241.12 --> 5246.04
yeah I bet they didn't use the word

5243.46 --> 5248.76
atmosphere in ancient Greek in ancient

5246.04 --> 5248.76
Greece okay

5248.86 --> 5252.639
so you might want to think that through

5250.9 --> 5254.379999999999
a little bit more carefully before you

5252.639 --> 5257.38
make such a statement as well no the

5254.38 --> 5259.78
Greeks knew other Greeks knew the globe

5257.38 --> 5262.3
and the Greeks we got our language of

5259.78 --> 5264.46
all sphere [ __ ] from the Greeks yeah

5262.3 --> 5268.860000000001
[ __ ]

5264.46 --> 5268.86
do I didn't believe it was a glow

5268.9 --> 5272.339999999999
they weren't [ __ ]

5274.179 --> 5279.6990000000005
that's modern projection onto the Greeks

5277.719 --> 5283.719
and literally making up historical

5279.699 --> 5287.08
figures yeah like his aristotenes made

5283.719 --> 5289.2390000000005
up historical figure yeah

5287.08 --> 5290.8
you could trace it back

5289.239 --> 5293.98
right

5290.8 --> 5296.56
just look at the dates

5293.98 --> 5300.459999999999
when was Aristotle's born

5296.56 --> 5303.280000000001
and what was used as an official proof

5300.46 --> 5305.5
to establish that aristotonis was indeed

5303.28 --> 5309.099999999999
a historical figure what was this book

5305.5 --> 5311.8
written by a historian back in the day

5309.1 --> 5313.620000000001
who wrote the book

5311.8 --> 5317.139
before

5313.62 --> 5320.139
aristotnes was officially born

5317.139 --> 5320.139
okay

5320.38 --> 5326.08
what can you conclude

5323.739 --> 5330.099999999999
that he's made up

5326.08 --> 5332.0199999999995
because the times don't match it's fraud

5330.1 --> 5334.780000000001
yeah

5332.02 --> 5338.860000000001
so yeah Greeks

5334.78 --> 5341.32
ancient Greece were not Globus

5338.86 --> 5343.78
they were philosophers

5341.32 --> 5347.62
and were mathematicians and they

5343.78 --> 5349.179
probably were like gaming around and

5347.62 --> 5351.04
it's like oh what we do with this

5349.179 --> 5352.4800000000005
projection and oh well maybe we could

5351.04 --> 5354.4
think of the Earth as a sphere because

5352.48 --> 5356.44
the stars are like a sphere they

5354.4 --> 5358.54
probably were like goofing around with

5356.44 --> 5362.199
that what I'm pretty sure they were

5358.54 --> 5363.94
doing was saying oh yeah the Earth is

5362.199 --> 5366.94
literally as Fair

5363.94 --> 5369.219
and we're in outer space endless outer

5366.94 --> 5371.678999999999
space yeah I'm pretty damn freaking sure

5369.219 --> 5372.82
that they did not think that at any

5371.679 --> 5375.219
point

5372.82 --> 5378.88
they were just playing around they were

5375.219 --> 5381.94
building yeah they were creating

5378.88 --> 5384.88
what would become Celestial navigation

5381.94 --> 5387.219
yeah messing around with it playing

5384.88 --> 5389.86
around with it philosophizing figuring

5387.219 --> 5391.2390000000005
out what's what

5389.86 --> 5393.099999999999
yeah

5391.239 --> 5394.78
guess what they didn't conclude it's a

5393.1 --> 5395.679
freaking sphere because it isn't a

5394.78 --> 5399.04
sphere

5395.679 --> 5402.4
the Earth is not a sphere it's flat yeah

5399.04 --> 5404.139
and a bunch of angles from a sun don't

5402.4 --> 5407.138999999999
prove the shape of the earth it just

5404.139 --> 5411.06
proves that you have an assumption of

5407.139 --> 5411.06
what that light is and where it is

5412.719 --> 5416.58
it doesn't prove it's fear at all

5421.239 --> 5425.159
we're so industry no we're not

5425.8 --> 5430.320000000001
we're not inside a sphere it's very

5427.84 --> 5430.32
unlikely

5432.639 --> 5437.4400000000005
I don't think it's spherical I don't

5434.8 --> 5440.1
think we're in under a dome I think that

5437.44 --> 5440.099999999999
we're in a box

5446.98 --> 5451.959999999999
I think we have a flat top

5449.56 --> 5454.0
as we have a flat Earth and I don't

5451.96 --> 5456.699
think there are walls I think it's

5454.0 --> 5460.12
looping I think it's nothing that can

5456.699 --> 5462.699
that any person can just easily grasp

5460.12 --> 5465.099999999999
and that makes perfect sense to me

5462.699 --> 5467.799999999999
I was to design a world I would design

5465.1 --> 5471.0
it so freaking complicated that people

5467.8 --> 5471.0
just couldn't get it

5486.76 --> 5492.179
stop bickering or another one more

5489.219 --> 5492.179
please

5502.96 --> 5510.9
wasn't there an argument that the flyer

5506.44 --> 5510.9
sits inside no there's not inside

5511.06 --> 5514.900000000001
so that's just Fierce holographic it

5513.219 --> 5520.42
doesn't have a position there's nothing

5514.9 --> 5523.08
inside or outside of it it's just there

5520.42 --> 5523.08
visually

5525.46 --> 5530.02
inside yeah I heard on Oakley well look

5527.679 --> 5532.42
there's still this like firmament

5530.02 --> 5534.52
weirdos who think oh it's eating the

5532.42 --> 5536.8
firmament and the lights are inside or

5534.52 --> 5539.02
outside there's still objects or

5536.8 --> 5540.6990000000005
something out there Out Of Reach yeah

5539.02 --> 5542.5
it's really cute it's it's all

5540.699 --> 5545.259999999999
holographic

5542.5 --> 5546.58
they don't have locations

5545.26 --> 5549.34
at all

5546.58 --> 5551.199
they move with you as you move you can

5549.34 --> 5553.6
approach it you can't see an angular

5551.199 --> 5555.82
size increase due to approach

5553.6 --> 5559.360000000001
none of the celestials including the sun

5555.82 --> 5562.239
or moon are physical objects that have a

5559.36 --> 5564.639
literal location they're all Holograms

5562.239 --> 5566.62
and I don't know what other people are

5564.639 --> 5568.12
saying about it that are flat earthers

5566.62 --> 5570.28
whether they believe oh no they're there

5568.12 --> 5572.5
they're just beyond the Dome or blah

5570.28 --> 5575.5599999999995
blah blah I've heard all of that garbage

5572.5 --> 5576.699
for eight years I don't give a [ __ ] if

5575.56 --> 5578.5
they want to think of it like that

5576.699 --> 5580.54
that's really cute

5578.5 --> 5582.58
I'm going to try to get a little bit

5580.54 --> 5585.34
more real

5582.58 --> 5587.92
even though it seems surreal and try to

5585.34 --> 5590.46
figure out like what the hell is that

5587.92 --> 5594.1
what the hell are the celestial lights

5590.46 --> 5596.86
how is that possible

5594.1 --> 5599.139
what are the implications yeah

5596.86 --> 5601.42
if they're not physical objects in any

5599.139 --> 5603.34
location the implications are staggering

5601.42 --> 5605.1990000000005
mainly

5603.34 --> 5609.159000000001
the actual

5605.199 --> 5611.98
shape of the container of the realm

5609.159 --> 5614.379999999999
becomes much more dynamic in its

5611.98 --> 5616.9
possibility yeah because oh yeah if it's

5614.38 --> 5619.659000000001
literally a sudden the moon moving in a

5616.9 --> 5621.28
disk yeah well then it would have to be

5619.659 --> 5623.86
a dome wouldn't it

5621.28 --> 5626.679
because what the [ __ ] is gonna happen to

5623.86 --> 5628.719
those physical objects in the disc right

5626.679 --> 5630.6990000000005
it would have to be a dome yeah yeah

5628.719 --> 5631.659
well guess what if it's holographic and

5630.699 --> 5634.9
it is

5631.659 --> 5637.5599999999995
there doesn't have to be anything

5634.9 --> 5640.599999999999
there could be anything or nothing

5637.56 --> 5643.84
because it the shape

5640.6 --> 5648.1
of the realm doesn't matter

5643.84 --> 5651.52
to the celestials it doesn't matter

5648.1 --> 5655.42
you see because the celestials are not a

5651.52 --> 5657.400000000001
side effect of the shape of the

5655.42 --> 5660.2390000000005
container

5657.4 --> 5663.699
they're just there they're just

5660.239 --> 5667.239
Holograms they appear at an apparent

5663.699 --> 5670.0
distance and they always appear there

5667.239 --> 5671.739
and no matter where you are except maybe

5670.0 --> 5673.96
really high up and then they allegedly

5671.739 --> 5674.98
disappear or weird things happens to the

5673.96 --> 5677.58
Holograms

5674.98 --> 5677.58
but

5678.4 --> 5683.86
they're Holograms the shape of the

5681.58 --> 5686.44
container has no influence or a bearing

5683.86 --> 5688.36
on them directly because there's no

5686.44 --> 5690.5199999999995
physical thing that needs to be

5688.36 --> 5692.32
contained like that

5690.52 --> 5694.06
they're just lights they just appear

5692.32 --> 5695.98
doesn't matter what the shape of the

5694.06 --> 5698.7390000000005
container is

5695.98 --> 5703.36
yeah there are other things that are

5698.739 --> 5706.959999999999
much more grounding into a specific form

5703.36 --> 5708.88
like okay if there's signals bouncing

5706.96 --> 5710.62
off right

5708.88 --> 5713.62
well

5710.62 --> 5715.96
then you have a vector

5713.62 --> 5717.46
you have an alteration in the vector

5715.96 --> 5721.2390000000005
perhaps if you do that at another

5717.46 --> 5724.9
location you can start to derive

5721.239 --> 5726.58
a shape of a flat ceiling what I think

5724.9 --> 5732.42
is flat

5726.58 --> 5732.42
based off what what comes back it right

5736.6 --> 5740.56
so yeah

5737.98 --> 5743.62
I think it's a flat top

5740.56 --> 5746.280000000001
makes much more sense because if it's a

5743.62 --> 5746.28
dome then

5752.32 --> 5758.5199999999995
well then you could like

5755.62 --> 5761.92
scan everywhere I'd say

5758.52 --> 5764.1990000000005
I mean if it's literally a dome then any

5761.92 --> 5766.4400000000005
you just need to know the shape of it

5764.199 --> 5770.32
and then you can point basically

5766.44 --> 5772.599999999999
anywhere and and get a reflection from

5770.32 --> 5776.58
almost any position on Earth

5772.6 --> 5776.58
right will be very easy

5776.8 --> 5782.5
if it's a flat top however you're a

5779.679 --> 5785.02
little bit more limited although there

5782.5 --> 5786.82
would probably be more Precision in

5785.02 --> 5788.9400000000005
signals

5786.82 --> 5793.259999999999
because there's no

5788.94 --> 5793.259999999999
reflective Distortion because it's flat

5794.8 --> 5799.860000000001
so yeah I don't know man

5797.139 --> 5799.86
I don't know

5803.08 --> 5809.139
is it flat or is it a dome

5807.04 --> 5812.139
I'd say it's flat

5809.139 --> 5815.1990000000005
but I don't know

5812.139 --> 5818.7390000000005
I certainly know that whatever the shape

5815.199 --> 5822.719
is the celestial lights have no bearing

5818.739 --> 5822.718999999999
on the shape of the container

5828.239 --> 5831.54
circular sword

5831.82 --> 5836.38
oh you don't get it oh you don't get the

5834.82 --> 5838.599999999999
entire thing that I've been explaining

5836.38 --> 5841.9800000000005
just now yeah no surprise there

5838.6 --> 5841.9800000000005
flataholics anonymous

5845.679 --> 5850.0
that's Celestial Holograms

5850.12 --> 5855.34
has no bearing on the shape of the

5852.76 --> 5858.900000000001
container they're Holograms they don't

5855.34 --> 5858.900000000001
have actual positions

5859.36 --> 5864.699
they just appear

5861.58 --> 5867.46
visually they don't have positions the

5864.699 --> 5869.138999999999
shape of whatever is surrounding it has

5867.46 --> 5871.6
no bearing on it

5869.139 --> 5874.6
it just does what it does the Hologram

5871.6 --> 5877.8
of the celestial lights just do what

5874.6 --> 5882.34
they do they have no

5877.8 --> 5884.820000000001
influences on them from the shape of the

5882.34 --> 5884.82
container

5888.699 --> 5892.659
that's convenient yeah

5890.679 --> 5895.179
it's also true

5892.659 --> 5897.94
it's just true

5895.179 --> 5901.7390000000005
yeah celestials are Holograms

5897.94 --> 5901.739
shape has no bearing on them

5902.1 --> 5907.719
physicality has no bearing on them

5905.8 --> 5909.52
they're a hologram they're not physical

5907.719 --> 5912.219
things

5909.52 --> 5915.580000000001
they don't have an actual position

5912.219 --> 5918.719
the architecture of the container has no

5915.58 --> 5918.719
bearing on them

5921.46 --> 5926.26
operation fish boiler fish tank the flat

5924.639 --> 5929.159000000001
top

5926.26 --> 5929.159000000001
yeah whatever

5931.179 --> 5935.26
I mean what the [ __ ] even is Operation

5933.88 --> 5937.719
fish oil

5935.26 --> 5939.0
did that even really happen or was it

5937.719 --> 5942.4
just more

5939.0 --> 5944.86
weirdo planting of ideas

5942.4 --> 5948.099999999999
right maybe they were gonna set Oh no

5944.86 --> 5950.5
you're you're trapped in a dome

5948.1 --> 5952.2390000000005
right well what if it's a flat top oh

5950.5 --> 5954.28
yeah well then there could be a lot more

5952.239 --> 5958.138999999999
space Oh yeah yeah

5954.28 --> 5961.179
so we're going to basically plant before

5958.139 --> 5964.12
we're even gonna before anything is even

5961.179 --> 5967.719
allowed to be accepted publicly we're

5964.12 --> 5969.94
just gonna plant that how it's a dome

5967.719 --> 5972.58
when we're still gonna say it's actually

5969.94 --> 5974.919999999999
a globe and all that in outer space but

5972.58 --> 5977.86
we'll already plan to you

5974.92 --> 5980.1990000000005
the next idea that you're gonna have

5977.86 --> 5981.58
once you finally realize that the Earth

5980.199 --> 5984.04
is not a ball

5981.58 --> 5985.659
it's got to be that dome right operation

5984.04 --> 5988.3
fist boil

5985.659 --> 5991.739
fish boil I like that more fish boil

5988.3 --> 5991.7390000000005
operation fish boil

5993.94 --> 6000.0
let's cook that fish a red herring

5998.139 --> 6002.28
should have called it operation red

6000.0 --> 6004.02
herring

6002.28 --> 6008.28
because I don't think anything happened

6004.02 --> 6009.540000000001
I don't think they shot any nukes nukes

6008.28 --> 6011.28
don't exist

6009.54 --> 6013.92
so why the [ __ ] would you think that

6011.28 --> 6016.32
they would shoot nukes up against the

6013.92 --> 6019.5
Fishbowl

6016.32 --> 6022.32
when they obviously don't exist

6019.5 --> 6024.719
like how are you then believing

6022.32 --> 6028.5599999999995
that the Earth is domed because of

6024.719 --> 6031.62
operation Fishbowl in which nukes which

6028.56 --> 6034.320000000001
don't exist were shot up and hitting the

6031.62 --> 6037.62
firmament which is a bowl because it's

6034.32 --> 6042.08
operation Fishbowl to get it get it it's

6037.62 --> 6043.92
a secret it's a secret

6042.08 --> 6046.139
yes

6043.92 --> 6049.5
that's why everybody knows about it

6046.139 --> 6052.4400000000005
because it's secretly a dome

6049.5 --> 6057.48
yes we're not trying to pre-program you

6052.44 --> 6057.48
for the next illusion at all really

6065.04 --> 6068.96
well I'm on fire today by the way

6083.52 --> 6088.7390000000005
uh don't do that all right don't be so

6086.699 --> 6091.259999999999
annoying

6088.739 --> 6093.0599999999995
QE is not the Arbiter of all things he

6091.26 --> 6094.5
literally told me that I was talking

6093.06 --> 6097.38
nonsense when I said that the

6094.5 --> 6099.3
thermosphere doesn't exist

6097.38 --> 6102.659000000001
I brought everything that I talked about

6099.3 --> 6105.78
my show I put forth in Skype a week ago

6102.659 --> 6107.719
and kiwi responded like no they measured

6105.78 --> 6110.219
it through that device at a distance

6107.719 --> 6112.679
yuja it literally said you just don't

6110.219 --> 6115.139
understand and eventually everybody

6112.679 --> 6117.9
caught on and he kind of bolted

6115.139 --> 6120.179
he hasn't like yesterday too when I

6117.9 --> 6124.4
brought it up in the after after show

6120.179 --> 6124.4
he immediately dropped the call

6125.34 --> 6128.88
don't think about the Third the

6126.179 --> 6133.4
thermosphere that QE doesn't really want

you're you you just uh lost your wrench

6268.92 --> 6272.6
yeah no it is terrible

and that makes me think

6277.619 --> 6282.78
you don't deserve that wrench because

6279.659 --> 6284.48
that's a gamma remark

6282.78 --> 6289.159
and uh

6284.48 --> 6289.159
yeah I don't like that attitude at all

6302.639 --> 6308.179
I'm still wondering why I gave you a

6304.679 --> 6308.179
wrench in the first place I mean

6309.54 --> 6317.36
just get a lot of like bad vibes from

6313.199 --> 6317.36

6317.52 --> 6321.900000000001
so uh

6319.38 --> 6324.84
I don't know what it is but yeah you

6321.9 --> 6327.0
don't have a wrench anymore

6324.84 --> 6329.52
