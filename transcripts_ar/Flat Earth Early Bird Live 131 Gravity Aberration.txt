7.61 --> 24.62
[Music]

34.01 --> 41.489
[Music]

37.67 --> 45.21
good morning welcome to flatter the

41.489 --> 53.57899999999999
earlybird number 131 I'm your host

45.21 --> 59.78
Arwen and today and it's not bad not

53.579 --> 59.78
cold what cloudy crash

69.789 --> 81.99000000000001
altogether another bad day yeah

77.38 --> 86.04899999999999
and I was actually pleasantly surprised

81.99 --> 92.53
this morning yes

86.049 --> 94.869
yeah there was a vote yesterday and yeah

92.53 --> 98.95
I saw people standing in line to vote

94.869 --> 102.46
and to be fair I was actually yeah kind

98.95 --> 105.88
of too late I realized like during my

102.46 --> 109.24
newspaper rounds oh wait today is they

105.88 --> 113.229
were supposed to vote and I yeah when I

109.24 --> 116.25
got back I was pretty much too late but

113.229 --> 116.25
it wasn't

119.11 --> 122.46
it was for the

124.02 --> 134.31
members of the provincial states so it

127.479 --> 134.31
was like a province government thing

135.9 --> 142.17000000000002
but yeah I forgot and thought no okay

139.29 --> 143.849
we'll just see where that goes and today

142.17 --> 149.28
I was actually quite pleasantly

143.849 --> 153.599
surprised to hear that the party forum

149.28 --> 160.29
for democracy did actually come out with

153.599 --> 164.28
a massive what is it 12 seats which was

160.29 --> 168.239
kind of unheard of it's a good entry and

164.28 --> 172.53
yeah the the guy leads the party about

168.239 --> 176.22
that he has been very active in media

172.53 --> 178.92
for a long time and I like pretty much

176.22 --> 183.329
everything he had has to say on average

178.92 --> 189.72
it's very libertarian very truth

183.329 --> 191.76000000000002
oriented so it seems criticism on the

189.72 --> 197.7
whole climate bill climate change

191.76 --> 202.47
nonsense against mass immigration yeah

197.7 --> 205.88899999999998
very sensible guy that seems to be

202.47 --> 207.959
promoting libertarian democracy and I

205.889 --> 210.06
like that a lot so it's kind of a good

207.959 --> 216.18
feeling like okay this guy is getting

210.06 --> 217.95
grip gives us some hope and yeah that

216.18 --> 220.019
made me feel good even though I actually

217.95 --> 223.099
forgot to vote this time it's good to

220.019 --> 227.669
know that people out there do follow

223.099 --> 234.209
follow the this movement this political

227.669 --> 238.609
party and are encouraged by it to let it

234.209 --> 241.62
manifest because yeah the original

238.609 --> 242.45000000000002
political groups here are just utterly

241.62 --> 248.39000000000001
utter

242.45 --> 251.0
corrupted so corrupted that yeah even

248.39 --> 253.57999999999998
the average stupid person just knows

251.0 --> 256.76
that they are total lying

253.58 --> 259.22
[ __ ] politicians at this moment are

256.76 --> 263.0
just pandering to the New World Order to

259.22 --> 264.83000000000004
the the bigger comptroller groups that

263.0 --> 267.169
really don't give a [ __ ] about the

264.83 --> 270.169
public so yeah that was good it was

267.169 --> 276.19
encouraging to see that hope it stays

270.169 --> 276.19
well could almost say like this maybe

276.55 --> 284.81
the Dutch Trump arriving at the scene

281.139 --> 286.84000000000003
for real now although it's a little bit

284.81 --> 291.79
too early to tell

286.84 --> 291.78999999999996
but yeah got a good feeling about that

296.26 --> 301.3
let's see where it goes it's not over

300.31 --> 304.0
yet by a long shot

301.3 --> 309.16
anyway that happened that made me feel

304.0 --> 312.91
kind of good then I heard about the

309.16 --> 317.11
Logan Paul documentary or rather the

312.91 --> 321.46000000000004
mockumentary and I haven't seen it I did

317.11 --> 325.36
open the video and glanced through it it

321.46 --> 327.7
was very noisy Yeley very attention

325.36 --> 331.0
grabby and from what I gathered it's

327.7 --> 334.3
pretty much a mockumentary exactly what

331.0 --> 334.99
almost everyone that knew that was

334.3 --> 340.45
coming

334.99 --> 345.24
had expected and a personal message in

340.45 --> 348.03999999999996
that regard to Logan Pole and that is a

345.24 --> 350.23
you're you're so popular so you're so

348.04 --> 354.88
cool you're so attention grabby with

350.23 --> 359.71000000000004
your freaking suicide forest in Japan

354.88 --> 363.13
mockery okay dude the net if you decide

359.71 --> 365.97999999999996
to go to the Flat Earth thing conference

363.13 --> 369.01
again and I happen to be there you

365.98 --> 371.74
better avoid me because if I know you're

369.01 --> 373.3
there I'm probably gonna either punch

371.74 --> 375.91
you in the stomach or kick you in the

373.3 --> 379.63
balls and you can sue me for that

375.91 --> 383.26000000000005
afterward but you deserve it and you

379.63 --> 386.5
need to piss off and stick to your troll

383.26 --> 388.74
audience so that's my message to Logan

386.5 --> 388.74
Paul

391.37 --> 395.66
or maybe I'll just throw a bucket of

393.53 --> 399.14
water over you in public something like

395.66 --> 402.02000000000004
that because yeah

399.14 --> 406.93
piss off you're not welcome anymore your

402.02 --> 410.14
shitty trolling so yeah that was that

406.93 --> 410.14
what else

417.559 --> 425.04900000000004
yeah Voynich yep that's a funny that you

421.369 --> 429.73900000000003
mention it I I kind of try to address it

425.049 --> 433.849
yesterday a bit and that is yeah the

429.739 --> 442.12899999999996
Dutch and the Jews the Jews have always

433.849 --> 445.459
been very historically close in it in a

442.129 --> 450.259
way that's not necessarily evil I'd say

445.459 --> 457.569
but just dude been working together well

450.259 --> 460.639
and bankers have been good to the Dutch

457.569 --> 464.47900000000004
traditionally originally it helped us

460.639 --> 465.399
become pretty great pretty fast during

464.479 --> 471.469
the Renaissance

465.399 --> 473.919
so is said and so yeah did you you could

471.469 --> 479.359
say that the Jews have been kind of good

473.919 --> 482.62899999999996
to the Dutch but yeah that that seemed

479.359 --> 485.779
to have changed when the New World Order

482.629 --> 489.469
came on the scene and the Netherlands

485.779 --> 495.02
the locals here just been swept aside as

489.469 --> 499.01
a side note but yeah

495.02 --> 505.43
I think there's still something to be

499.01 --> 507.89
gotten there who raised the the good

505.43 --> 510.2
Joe's the good yous that are basically

507.89 --> 512.54
Christian and that embraced logos

510.2 --> 518.95
embrace God and don't reject it and

512.54 --> 522.9499999999999
become leftist atheists power grabbing

518.95 --> 525.83
sociopathic bastards that just suppress

522.95 --> 534.37
and rule us all like a bunch of neo few

525.83 --> 534.37
lists and yeah we'll see where that goes

540.32 --> 547.4300000000001
no I haven't banned Jose yet you'll have

543.38 --> 552.13
to pop in my screen first before I do

547.43 --> 552.13
that before I am able to do that

564.64 --> 590.14
so let's see it was in chat bill G early

576.779 --> 594.79
session Graham brown sprout lover to it

590.14 --> 597.519
wit before in each clearly flatters then

594.79 --> 603.18
you field [ __ ] yous righteous force 101

597.519 --> 606.57
rockhound the earth circus peanuts clerk

603.18 --> 606.5699999999999
Judy Bennett

607.82 --> 618.99
nothing happening Shane Walter your MC

616.1 --> 625.5500000000001
yeah I think Chris Matt I think I got

618.99 --> 629.25
everyone now yeah I just addressed that

625.55 --> 631.14
don't ask me like 30 seconds after I

629.25 --> 633.35
just addressed something that's really

631.14 --> 633.35
annoying

640.1 --> 643.03
listen

645.75 --> 652.86
so yeah as far as what is this name

649.17 --> 657.689
again yeah yeah

652.86 --> 661.17
Ruby Davidson yeah I think that Robbie

657.689 --> 666.329
Davidson was a fool to let Logan Pauline

661.17 --> 672.12
and yeah I I even said it the moment I

666.329 --> 675.7199999999999
found out yeah I think what he did was

672.12 --> 680.16
kind of trying to be opportunist in the

675.72 --> 683.1600000000001
sense that any exposure is good exposure

680.16 --> 687.24
and that's really nice in a movement

683.16 --> 690.3
that is kind of upcoming and that would

687.24 --> 694.17
probably have worked up until - any 18

690.3 --> 696.5089999999999
but after that point yeah we have

694.17 --> 698.04
started to enter kind of the common

696.509 --> 700.98
knowledge ground in the sense that

698.04 --> 703.139
everyone has heard of Flat Earth and I

700.98 --> 706.98
don't think that concept works anymore

703.139 --> 712.439
after that point I think the negative

706.98 --> 717.089
side effects are bigger than just a raw

712.439 --> 720.029
form of first exposure and I think that

717.089 --> 722.5500000000001
anyone out here in the flat earth

720.029 --> 726.68
movement let's just call it that

722.55 --> 728.43
includes Robbie Davidson but that also

726.68 --> 733.8599999999999
very much

728.43 --> 737.189
means mark Sargent right mark sergeant's

733.86 --> 741.7090000000001
better be listening really listening or

737.189 --> 745.5
I will actually start to become more

741.709 --> 750.569
criticizing on you for what you do it no

745.5 --> 753.959
longer works you have to drop that meme

750.569 --> 758.459
that it's become and realized that not

753.959 --> 760.779
that no longer works any exposure is not

758.459 --> 764.2399999999999
good exposure anymore

760.779 --> 767.8389999999999
and we actually need to emphasize more

764.24 --> 769.97
that we do realize what we're doing that

767.839 --> 774.5290000000001
we're not going to ignore the criticism

769.97 --> 778.6990000000001
out there and let anyone in for the sake

774.529 --> 784.459
of some superficial exposure we don't

778.699 --> 787.04
need more mockumentaries so yeah I hope

784.459 --> 789.6389999999999
you're listening mark so think you

787.04 --> 792.5889999999999
should probably tone down some of your

789.639 --> 796.85
kind of your dark jokes which is your

792.589 --> 803.5690000000001
thing I know it is but I think you

796.85 --> 806.36
should kind of try to drop that or at

803.569 --> 810.04
least tone it down because it's getting

806.36 --> 810.04
disturbing you know

815.97 --> 820.5
and that's that's that

826.66 --> 834.5
no I haven't seen it I just figured it

830.36 --> 837.44
out it existed like 40 minutes before

834.5 --> 841.73
the show started but it glanced through

837.44 --> 845.649
it and yeah it looks very noisy and

841.73 --> 849.79
attention grabby and the mockumentary

845.649 --> 849.79
and I like beyond the curve

856.17 --> 858.62
yeah

868.26 --> 877.23
right Rob from the clock you're you're

873.24 --> 880.71
often kind of a dick in my chat but I

877.23 --> 884.61
agree with you on Robbie Davidson and I

880.71 --> 887.22
will remember that he did that and that

884.61 --> 889.92
he was trying to be an opportunist and

887.22 --> 891.9300000000001
it's not good for the flat earth at all

889.92 --> 894.3299999999999
and that needs to stop

891.93 --> 900.0799999999999
that attitude needs to stop you don't

894.33 --> 900.08
want to stop it then [ __ ] off all right

900.98 --> 907.59
yeah you know you may think you're some

904.86 --> 911.13
kind of leader whatever I I don't think

907.59 --> 915.45
that of myself at all you do and yeah

911.13 --> 918.0
it's good to be organizing stuff but you

915.45 --> 920.34
got to do it right because otherwise

918.0 --> 924.38
it's gonna be a mess and no more

920.34 --> 928.02
opportunist outsider [ __ ] like this

924.38 --> 930.51
you're gonna get an outsider in then you

928.02 --> 932.52
better damn well make sure they're not

930.51 --> 935.25
gonna make a mockumentary out of it

932.52 --> 940.92
because that no longer works to the

935.25 --> 943.95
advantage of Flat Earth at all at all so

940.92 --> 946.5799999999999
you got to stop that from now on don't

943.95 --> 946.58
do that anymore

959.63 --> 968.899
Yeah right five artists lemur Alice look

962.329 --> 973.819
Logan Paul is is an actor to be fair he

968.899 --> 976.399
is an actor he does not act naturally he

973.819 --> 983.029
has script writers he has a media team

976.399 --> 986.24
and yeah that makes him an actor because

983.029 --> 989.48
I don't think he improvises really

986.24 --> 991.88
outside of just a few minor interaction

989.48 --> 995.6
details he mostly follows a freaking

991.88 --> 1000.639
script and he does it so very precisely

995.6 --> 1002.889
and yeah he is an actor so I wouldn't be

1000.639 --> 1006.149
surprised if every single person that

1002.889 --> 1010.5600000000001
was part of that movie was acting

1006.149 --> 1013.839
according to a very specific set script

1010.56 --> 1018.25
cultural attitudes and memes and all

1013.839 --> 1020.98
very well calculated out using

1018.25 --> 1023.74
statistical analysis to figure out how

1020.98 --> 1027.539
to touch the most and manipulate the

1023.74 --> 1027.539
most people in his audience

1038.56 --> 1044.6399999999999
right yeah well Shane Walter yeah the

1041.74 --> 1049.24
thing is about mockumentary isn't about

1044.64 --> 1051.67
outsider responses to Flat Earth it

1049.24 --> 1053.95
doesn't matter if they can prove or

1051.67 --> 1057.21
disprove it what matters at this point

1053.95 --> 1061.3
and what Mack mockumentaries are for is

1057.21 --> 1064.24
to plant ridicule in association with

1061.3 --> 1066.6299999999999
the target in this case Flat Earth so

1064.24 --> 1069.67
anyone that watch it will just feel

1066.63 --> 1072.0100000000002
ridiculous about it and will not be

1069.67 --> 1073.5700000000002
encouraged to look deeper into the

1072.01 --> 1077.2
details because they will get the

1073.57 --> 1081.4299999999998
feeling that it's all just there to fool

1077.2 --> 1084.28
them to trick them to get them into

1081.43 --> 1088.3300000000002
trouble that's what an effective

1084.28 --> 1092.83
mockumentary does and there is no good

1088.33 --> 1095.08
side of it in a time when the subculture

1092.83 --> 1101.99
can call it a subculture right now flat

1095.08 --> 1104.84
earth is already widespread doesn't work

1101.99 --> 1107.509
doesn't work to our advantage any

1104.84 --> 1113.23
exposure is not good exposure anymore

1107.509 --> 1113.23
that times over we've passed that line

1123.22 --> 1130.1100000000001
and yeah to realize if there's gonna be

1127.24 --> 1133.21
like real good Flat Earth non

1130.11 --> 1135.85
mockumentary documentaries out there

1133.21 --> 1138.16
even that's gonna receive the ridicule

1135.85 --> 1140.11
because the ridicule will always be

1138.16 --> 1142.1200000000001
there okay that's this that's the

1140.11 --> 1144.28
consequence of Flat Earth even though

1142.12 --> 1148.84
I'll guarantee you even though it

1144.28 --> 1153.1
becomes like a highly sub mainstream

1148.84 --> 1156.25
mainstream then even there will be

1153.1 --> 1160.7199999999998
people psychologically attacking and

1156.25 --> 1164.2
opposing it until the end and Flat Earth

1160.72 --> 1168.13
may be one of the few subjects that will

1164.2 --> 1169.99
have that contrast to most other things

1168.13 --> 1174.0700000000002
that are happening in the world most

1169.99 --> 1177.1200000000001
other movements and beliefs and that

1174.07 --> 1177.12
will continue nonetheless

1185.75 --> 1193.88
so yeah

1188.15 --> 1201.7900000000002
what I think Flat Earth needs is a real

1193.88 --> 1201.7900000000002
documentary constructed by professionals

1203.55 --> 1211.83
basically hired by us flat-earthers by

1207.42 --> 1214.17
people that are yep able to pay for the

1211.83 --> 1217.1
setup or such thing construction of such

1214.17 --> 1217.1000000000001
a thing and do

1218.78 --> 1225.02
do the same thing basically as beyond

1221.87 --> 1227.84
the curve kind of going with the

1225.02 --> 1230.93
conferences going with individuals going

1227.84 --> 1233.75
with researchers and then putting it out

1230.93 --> 1237.17
for real and no wishy-washy no good

1233.75 --> 1241.94
feely things although yeah that can be

1237.17 --> 1246.76
as a sidestep button very important to

1241.94 --> 1252.67
get the oversight and the technicalities

1246.76 --> 1255.14
right we can do that it's not that tough

1252.67 --> 1263.0500000000002
it's not even that it shouldn't even be

1255.14 --> 1268.5500000000002
that expensive so I suggest we do we

1263.05 --> 1272.75
Patricia are other people that are more

1268.55 --> 1276.02
connected in the flat earth do this get

1272.75 --> 1280.48
this done get very very serious about

1276.02 --> 1287.51
this don't [ __ ] around and make a real

1280.48 --> 1294.23
worthy documentary modern television

1287.51 --> 1298.64
quality music good videography good

1294.23 --> 1300.83
choreography whatever's needed get a

1298.64 --> 1305.3000000000002
professional get it done and get it done

1300.83 --> 1308.05
under our control and not some freaking

1305.3 --> 1313.51
corrupted media organization out there

1308.05 --> 1318.98
like the BBC or or some corporate

1313.51 --> 1321.31
corporatist tool like Logan Paul we got

1318.98 --> 1321.31
to do it

1323.67 --> 1328.1100000000001
yeah speak for yourself

1332.409 --> 1339.169
now thanks by the way for or using a

1336.83 --> 1352.999
wrench properly Shane Walter thank you

1339.169 --> 1355.3090000000002
for that Oh conspiracy theory a GM was

1352.999 --> 1357.47
the deal already struck but between them

1355.309 --> 1359.72
behind the scenes well yeah unless

1357.47 --> 1362.21
somebody can actually confirm that

1359.72 --> 1366.3500000000001
record that witness to that

1362.21 --> 1368.8690000000001
that's just aftermath conspiracy

1366.35 --> 1376.1589999999999
[ __ ] isn't gonna be helpful to

1368.869 --> 1380.4189999999999
anyone just be vigilant and hey on

1376.159 --> 1382.249
conferences okay if you're gonna be

1380.419 --> 1386.45
there as a flat earth or maybe not as

1382.249 --> 1390.289
well-known keep a freaking eye out check

1386.45 --> 1396.169
the main people what they're doing what

1390.289 --> 1396.379
they're trying to maneuver keep an eye

1396.169 --> 1402.3090000000002
out

1396.379 --> 1405.379
we need sharp minded observing

1402.309 --> 1409.999
journalists minded flat-earthers that

1405.379 --> 1413.6
just keep lookout to make sure nobody's

1409.999 --> 1415.94
making stupid deals to promote

1413.6 --> 1421.1899999999998
themselves in the cost of the Flat Earth

1415.94 --> 1423.3500000000001
or yeah that this this kind of [ __ ] just

1421.19 --> 1425.99
doesn't happen anymore it's got to be

1423.35 --> 1428.48
stopped and if somebody is going to do

1425.99 --> 1430.46
this shamelessly zero it's just a great

1428.48 --> 1436.07
it's great for the future it's great

1430.46 --> 1437.1490000000001
then you call them out hard no more

1436.07 --> 1440.4089999999999
[ __ ]

1437.149 --> 1440.4089999999999
you call them out hard

1441.21 --> 1448.32
on the spots if you can live on camera

1445.39 --> 1448.3200000000002
possible

1453.08 --> 1455.6499999999999
well

1461.48 --> 1470.21
yeah screw you Lottie I don't give a

1466.789 --> 1474.049
[ __ ] about my artificial view account if

1470.21 --> 1477.23
there are some religious fanatical

1474.049 --> 1480.83
followers of Flat Earth that think that

1477.23 --> 1484.8700000000001
I'm a good channel to follow Oh piss off

1480.83 --> 1489.32
go go to some other cult out there okay

1484.87 --> 1492.1999999999998
I'm real I'm doing things real I have

1489.32 --> 1495.049
principles very powerful principles that

1492.2 --> 1498.3500000000001
surpass anything including my popularity

1495.049 --> 1501.769
and if that means I only have five

1498.35 --> 1506.36
followers left at the end then so be it

1501.769 --> 1509.799
I don't give a [ __ ] I'm not going along

1506.36 --> 1512.7199999999998
with some kind of prefab blueprint

1509.799 --> 1518.6589999999999
designated for how Flat Earth should

1512.72 --> 1522.47
proceed [ __ ] that I will be me I will

1518.659 --> 1525.95
give you my opinion my insight and I

1522.47 --> 1527.99
will bend over the Flat Earth and be

1525.95 --> 1531.409
concerned about it and try to help it in

1527.99 --> 1536.419
the way that I think is the best for us

1531.409 --> 1538.659
and not for a group that's just thinking

1536.419 --> 1538.659
money

1539.4 --> 1544.5590000000002
whoever if that group is inside a flat

1542.55 --> 1547.44
earth or outside trying to tinker with

1544.559 --> 1551.79
it I don't care it's about the truth I

1547.44 --> 1554.55
don't give a [ __ ] about some railroading

1551.79 --> 1558.48
attempt and peer pressure okay [ __ ] peer

1554.55 --> 1561.78
pressure if I would ever have gone along

1558.48 --> 1566.19
because of peer pressure then I wouldn't

1561.78 --> 1569.6299999999999
be here I wouldn't be here having a show

1566.19 --> 1569.63
talking about Flat Earth

1573.22 --> 1585.24
I'd probably be doing exactly the

1580.63 --> 1585.24
opposite but I'm not

1589.58 --> 1595.6999999999998
so yeah and hey if you want me to keep

1592.34 --> 1600.08
on doing that that subscribe to my

1595.7 --> 1602.299
channel make sure you stay subscribe to

1600.08 --> 1605.529
my channel because YouTube is screwing

1602.299 --> 1610.6689999999999
around with me and I still have that

1605.529 --> 1613.369
strike on hold from my yeah Christ in my

1610.669 --> 1618.8200000000002
first Christ Church video which makes no

1613.369 --> 1621.6789999999999
damn sense and could get worse and I

1618.82 --> 1624.32
might just be demonetised because of it

1621.679 --> 1626.3300000000002
not that I've even received a single

1624.32 --> 1638.9189999999999
cent from you two

1626.33 --> 1638.9189999999999
yet after months you'd go screw yourself

1642.909 --> 1650.0590000000002
yeah see that's that's how that works

1646.419 --> 1653.739
that's why I do that because you are a

1650.059 --> 1657.83
total [ __ ] [ __ ]

1653.739 --> 1662.47
and you don't know when to shut the [ __ ]

1657.83 --> 1670.039
up and not be a piece [ __ ] troll and

1662.47 --> 1675.8500000000001
that's why i ban you okay so keep a lid

1670.039 --> 1675.85
on your freaking loud shitty mouth

1682.88 --> 1689.0900000000001
yeah and I'll consider unblocking you in

1685.74 --> 1692.67
a few weeks time but you got to learn

1689.09 --> 1694.4399999999998
you need to shut your freaking mouth if

1692.67 --> 1702.89
they're coming nothing out of it but

1694.44 --> 1705.71
[ __ ] so anyway to continue my statement

1702.89 --> 1710.19
if you really do want to help me out

1705.71 --> 1713.07
then yeah donate to my paypal above all

1710.19 --> 1715.6200000000001
else the super chat still kind of cool

1713.07 --> 1717.8999999999999
but yeah there's no guarantee it's ever

1715.62 --> 1720.87
gonna arrive you know YouTube's gonna

1717.9 --> 1722.5500000000002
take a lot of money out of it and there

1720.87 --> 1724.32
may be a chance that certainly I get

1722.55 --> 1727.77
demonetized and everybody's just sent

1724.32 --> 1729.45
their money back so if you really want

1727.77 --> 1732.27
to help out then do it through PayPal

1729.45 --> 1735.99
because that arrives I can cash it

1732.27 --> 1739.98
immediately YouTube doesn't get [ __ ] so

1735.99 --> 1744.42
win-win in that sense and it really

1739.98 --> 1746.85
helps me out like some of my most loyal

1744.42 --> 1750.8400000000001
viewers have supported me this way and

1746.85 --> 1753.77
it helped out a lot it helped me out so

1750.84 --> 1753.77
much even that

1755.74 --> 1761.02
I didn't have to borrow any money from

1758.23 --> 1763.09
anyone just to get around just to be

1761.02 --> 1765.61
able to buy food bhisma and that was

1763.09 --> 1769.2099999999998
super awesome and now I have the

1765.61 --> 1774.25
maneuverability again to get a new mic

1769.21 --> 1776.71
and so I am in the works of ordering a

1774.25 --> 1780.19
new one which is going to be like 50

1776.71 --> 1783.97
euros more than the previous try but

1780.19 --> 1787.24
yeah I did get 50 euros roughly again

1783.97 --> 1789.34
through PayPal so yeah to be fair I I

1787.24 --> 1794.26
should be able to afford this without

1789.34 --> 1796.0
much problem and yeah I will do it very

1794.26 --> 1799.33
soon yeah Roger

1796.0 --> 1802.06
MC I'm talking about the super Jets it

1799.33 --> 1804.85
happened to Owen Benjamin as well not

1802.06 --> 1807.61
too long ago he got demonetized

1804.85 --> 1810.37
and you to basically tell them yeah

1807.61 --> 1813.03
we're sending all the super chats back

1810.37 --> 1813.03
to sender

1817.69 --> 1823.1100000000001
and the rights that's where you leave

1826.97 --> 1832.7
yeah and I kind of expect that to happen

1829.94 --> 1834.6200000000001
to me at this point so that's why I'm

1832.7 --> 1840.77
saying if you really want to support me

1834.62 --> 1845.27
do it through PayPal I will mention you

1840.77 --> 1849.3799999999999
if you do and yeah since you have to use

1845.27 --> 1852.5
your own name you can message me if you

1849.38 --> 1855.89
don't want me to yes speak out the name

1852.5 --> 1857.93
and just use your YouTube account the

1855.89 --> 1862.15
best way to do that is to tell me

1857.93 --> 1865.5700000000002
through Skype so contact me on skype and

1862.15 --> 1865.5700000000002
just tell me

1888.03 --> 1895.8
piss off PJ you stupid [ __ ] [ __ ]

1894.15 --> 1901.2
obsessed idiots

1895.8 --> 1903.1499999999999
I will ask for money here and that does

1901.2 --> 1905.63
not make me one of them that makes me

1903.15 --> 1911.7900000000002
somebody who is just trying a freakin

1905.63 --> 1914.2800000000002
survive and maybe get something to

1911.79 --> 1919.32
survive out of something that I do every

1914.28 --> 1923.73
day here it's taking up my time I like

1919.32 --> 1927.77
doing it though but yeah I am trying to

1923.73 --> 1927.77
move beyond okay

1928.25 --> 1936.24
right so add to all those with wrenches

1931.86 --> 1938.7299999999998
in my chat if anyone comes in my chat

1936.24 --> 1944.8700000000001
that has the word ute within it

1938.73 --> 1944.8700000000001
instantly ban him every single time

1966.57 --> 1975.76
yeah I know bill G right and look I am

1971.35 --> 1980.73
actually like trying to use this money

1975.76 --> 1980.73
to do something good with it

1995.39 --> 2003.22
I got the mic I will get the mic again

1997.82 --> 2005.2
it's gonna cost me like 150 euros so and

2003.22 --> 2007.3
I'm gonna get it and this time it's not

2005.2 --> 2010.8700000000001
gonna be broken and super disappointing

2007.3 --> 2013.1699999999998
and creating a failed show I was barely

2010.87 --> 2013.1699999999998
audible

2020.36 --> 2027.529
thank you see that was you that was you

2023.83 --> 2037.33
troll piece of [ __ ] and the entire troll

2027.529 --> 2037.33
crowd and yeah you need to go

2045.98 --> 2050.51
yeah

2047.9 --> 2054.7400000000002
ALX out of magic he's Dutch by the way

2050.51 --> 2056.75
so he's talking in Dutch said you'd stay

2054.74 --> 2059.45
neutral troll in the sense that he

2056.75 --> 2062.81
trolls everyone he's just a guy with a

2059.45 --> 2066.3199999999997
really really bad attitude and if you

2062.81 --> 2070.7
poke him he starts to turn into a semi

2066.32 --> 2075.86
gangster troll nasty bad attitude piece

2070.7 --> 2078.1099999999997
of [ __ ] and if anyone ever identifies

2075.86 --> 2081.9500000000003
who he is in person they should kick his

2078.11 --> 2083.6
ass because he is a burden on everyone

2081.95 --> 2087.98
and he's not funny

2083.6 --> 2089.83
he's just shitty I've never seen him say

2087.98 --> 2094.03

2119.41 --> 2123.7599999999998
focused on actual troll hurting and he

2122.32 --> 2131.4700000000003

2372.73 --> 2379.42
kill himself right yeah I said it

2376.11 --> 2385.78
if you're that shitty you need to end it

2379.42 --> 2389.11
so I don't know like I don't know how

2385.78 --> 2390.7000000000003
you want to do it but you need to end it

2389.11 --> 2393.79
because you're a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ]

2390.7 --> 2396.12
and you have no value in this world at

2393.79 --> 2396.12
all

2400.319 --> 2403.319
yeah

2424.71 --> 2429.51
Wow you had any respect for youth where

2428.579 --> 2431.9100000000003
have you been

2429.51 --> 2434.4300000000003
did you actually know who you was or

2431.91 --> 2437.04
just saw his name in chat in places

2434.43 --> 2439.5299999999997
because this is who he is he always does

2437.04 --> 2447.29
this [ __ ] he goes that far he is that

2439.53 --> 2449.7000000000003
shameless he's a freaking sociopath and

2447.29 --> 2456.18
that's right edge I'm you're actually a

2449.7 --> 2460.68
person that's yeah I will get pissed off

2456.18 --> 2465.8689999999997
at people when they get shitty but we

2460.68 --> 2469.2
can talk about it you know everybody

2465.869 --> 2474.089
gets in a bad mood sometimes like for

2469.2 --> 2477.3289999999997
example the situation where with Ali be

2474.089 --> 2480.0299999999997
where he was in a bad mood and I was

2477.329 --> 2485.73
kind of in a bad mood and I talked over

2480.03 --> 2490.17
him and then yeah he got really pissed

2485.73 --> 2492.39
off and he pissed off and yeah that that

2490.17 --> 2495.48
was kind of shitty but at least he's not

2492.39 --> 2497.1299999999997
gonna troll me and I will have talked

2495.48 --> 2498.9
afterwards where he will have a

2497.13 --> 2500.819
criticism why do you talk over your

2498.9 --> 2505.53
guests it's bad and I'll run I'll say

2500.819 --> 2508.079
yeah I know but it's my show and it's

2505.53 --> 2511.02
like one of my more annoying rules if I

2508.079 --> 2515.819
talk over people then I will talk over

2511.02 --> 2518.63
people on my show and that's just the

2515.819 --> 2520.95
way it is and I know Ali B will

2518.63 --> 2525.78
understand we've had some great shows

2520.95 --> 2529.43
here together so don't think he's gonna

2525.78 --> 2529.4300000000003
see that ever as a real problem

2531.54 --> 2536.5589999999997
because he's not a piece-of-shit troll

2534.309 --> 2540.0890000000004
that should end himself because he has

2536.559 --> 2543.2200000000003
no life and he only makes other people's

2540.089 --> 2546.45
people's lives miserable trying to rule

2543.22 --> 2549.3999999999996
everything as soon as you say something

2546.45 --> 2551.589
criticizing towards him time him out or

2549.4 --> 2554.65
anything you may be complaining about it

2551.589 --> 2558.21
but he's not gonna actually spam their

2554.65 --> 2562.0
chats with disgusting [ __ ] and

2558.21 --> 2565.839
outrageous accusations because he's an

2562.0 --> 2568.39
actual normal sociable human being that

2565.839 --> 2570.25
has principles and is not a soulless

2568.39 --> 2577.7799999999997
piece of [ __ ] troll that should end

2570.25 --> 2580.45
himself and that's why no things will be

2577.78 --> 2583.9300000000003
alright with me an ally afterwards just

2580.45 --> 2589.6499999999996
as things are alright with me an HTM you

2583.93 --> 2592.72
know you can all have our moments but

2589.65 --> 2596.04
yeah we're just human beings we have

2592.72 --> 2596.04
friction that's only natural

2597.81 --> 2603.27
but they'll never go and disgusting

2600.63 --> 2606.44
troll spam [ __ ] anyone because they're

2603.27 --> 2610.52
not pieces of [ __ ] that should end

2606.44 --> 2610.52
themselves like youth

2620.53 --> 2627.2900000000004
so yeah

2623.54 --> 2629.39
this is why I ban you and you know what

2627.29 --> 2633.47
since he's doing this anyway I'm calling

2629.39 --> 2635.5899999999997
him on everyone everyone every flattered

2633.47 --> 2642.5
channel that has ever heard of youth

2635.59 --> 2645.1400000000003
ever to ban him to block him to destroy

2642.5 --> 2650.35
every sock account he wasn't ever made

2645.14 --> 2653.98
and just remove him from the scene

2650.35 --> 2655.88
remove him and let him back let him go

2653.98 --> 2661.1
so mean

2655.88 --> 2664.61
irony so mean he actually banned me for

2661.1 --> 2666.83
being a nasty piece of [ __ ] you so mean

2664.61 --> 2671.4700000000003
so yeah it's only natural that you're

2666.83 --> 2674.6
gonna spam this chat with disgusting

2671.47 --> 2678.23
accusations of pedophilia and all this

2674.6 --> 2685.5099999999998
most revolting disgusting [ __ ] you could

2678.23 --> 2685.51
do to somebody and yeah if

2685.569 --> 2693.149
ever figure out who you are in the real

2688.239 --> 2693.149
world you're gonna get it

2700.71 --> 2703.71
yeah

2708.0 --> 2714.72
so yeah I'm calling upon all flattered

2710.4 --> 2719.2400000000002
channels all of them to ban ute been his

2714.72 --> 2723.6499999999996
regular counts ban all of his socks and

2719.24 --> 2727.5
give him a chance to walk away

2723.65 --> 2730.44
reconsider his life and when he figures

2727.5 --> 2735.84
out that he doesn't have any to just end

2730.44 --> 2739.34
it and walk away and be forgotten which

2735.84 --> 2742.82
is probably the best thing for him and

2739.34 --> 2742.82
for everyone

2776.869 --> 2780.13
now you don't know [ __ ]

2787.65 --> 2794.579
you don't know anything nobody even

2789.66 --> 2796.3489999999997
asked me you know nobody nobody even

2794.579 --> 2800.099
asked me like people draw their own

2796.349 --> 2803.19
conclusions they grow up spiraling into

2800.099 --> 2805.319
their own delusional interpretations of

2803.19 --> 2814.2290000000003
extremity and [ __ ] and nobody actually

2805.319 --> 2816.569
even asks me nobody there's two people

2814.229 --> 2820.529
behind the scene that actually asked me

2816.569 --> 2823.079
that actually care like yeah what were

2820.529 --> 2825.029
you going through is there something

2823.079 --> 2831.029
you're holding back for some reason

2825.029 --> 2833.16
and nobody else even asks me but yeah

2831.029 --> 2834.989
you're very content to just spam

2833.16 --> 2838.0789999999997
everyone about it

2834.989 --> 2841.799
span my chat try to ruin my hangout and

2838.079 --> 2844.71
even make ma cute mockumentary or just

2841.799 --> 2847.0389999999998
mocking videos about it and you don't

2844.71 --> 2851.869
even know what the hell's going on

2847.039 --> 2851.869
because you're a presumptuous [ __ ]

2863.9 --> 2866.559
yeah

2877.68 --> 2881.5389999999998
it's what some people do with their

2879.299 --> 2881.5389999999998
there

2884.15 --> 2888.13
and I was I'm doing fine

2888.74 --> 2895.33
getting bashed by youth here who has no

2893.03 --> 2895.3300000000004
life

2907.849 --> 2913.079
yeah

2909.74 --> 2914.91
so yeah most most of the subjects I

2913.079 --> 2921.17
pretty much dealt with the first half of

2914.91 --> 2924.24
this stream I am open for guests though

2921.17 --> 2927.96
so if anyone wants to join me talk about

2924.24 --> 2933.569
something anything logan paul dr.

2927.96 --> 2937.73
mockumentary or just whatever yeah get

2933.569 --> 2937.73
on my panel and we'll talk about it

2978.26 --> 2981.71
so yeah

2981.97 --> 2990.91
yesterday was kind of weird on the

2984.64 --> 2993.8489999999997
debates John did this weird global roll

2990.91 --> 2997.5099999999998
thing and then we were suddenly asked to

2993.849 --> 2999.579
prove the optics elements and I was

2997.51 --> 3002.67
completely unprepared for that was kind

2999.579 --> 3006.0890000000004
of embarrassing because yeah I can

3002.67 --> 3008.549
roughly explain these things but not in

3006.089 --> 3013.65
a very technical way and I've never been

3008.549 --> 3015.5389999999998
good at that like ever ever so yeah I

3013.65 --> 3017.579
was kind of dead like put on the spot

3015.539 --> 3019.619
there and really didn't know what to do

3017.579 --> 3022.26
with it I could just give a rough

3019.619 --> 3026.789
explanation the way that I do it but I

3022.26 --> 3030.599
am NOT a optical scientists another

3026.789 --> 3037.1400000000003
optical scientist I don't know the

3030.599 --> 3041.73
details unfortunately yeah I'm intuitive

3037.14 --> 3046.3489999999997
I'm visually sharp you can figure out

3041.73 --> 3049.049
what I see but to really get the science

3046.349 --> 3052.9100000000003
of optics right that's it's very

3049.049 --> 3055.5
difficult I find it very difficult and

3052.91 --> 3060.029
still in learning I don't know if I can

3055.5 --> 3062.849
ever completely get master that so yeah

3060.029 --> 3064.589
that's yeah that was yesterday

3062.849 --> 3066.7400000000002
and it was kind of embarrassing I felt

3064.589 --> 3066.74
embarrassed

3069.33 --> 3074.9
but yeah I'm not I'm not a an optical

3072.54 --> 3080.09
scientist that knows all these

3074.9 --> 3087.03
statistical calculus formula details

3080.09 --> 3088.4
unfortunately and yeah my specialty lies

3087.03 --> 3091.32
more in gravity

3088.4 --> 3093.54
especially because everybody else urban

3091.32 --> 3095.79
dude as soon as they got density and

3093.54 --> 3098.72
buoyancy and then just started to

3095.79 --> 3103.55
pretend like nothing else exists

3098.72 --> 3103.5499999999997
although yeah technically it doesn't but

3105.62 --> 3111.99
there's still the aberration these

3108.3 --> 3121.05
suggestions of the observations and all

3111.99 --> 3123.8599999999997
that so yeah gravity is more my - in the

3121.05 --> 3123.86
Flat Earth Lord

3128.97 --> 3135.18
because I know what it is and what it is

3131.4 --> 3138.02
not that's more than I can say for most

3135.18 --> 3138.02
flat earthers

3166.9 --> 3175.799
and I have the balls to acknowledge down

3170.369 --> 3178.839
right well that's the funny thing it is

3175.799 --> 3181.18
because of the relative density concept

3178.839 --> 3184.569
up and down becomes relative not

3181.18 --> 3187.27
involved but because of that because of

3184.569 --> 3190.079
this fanatical defense of the relative

3187.27 --> 3194.0389999999998
density theory suddenly everything else

3190.079 --> 3196.6600000000003
should be also ignored apparently

3194.039 --> 3202.8590000000004
because it's not relevant to their

3196.66 --> 3205.45
identity buoyancy concept and yeah and

3202.859 --> 3208.9
that's just one of the aspects one of

3205.45 --> 3211.39
the first because it's also ignores the

3208.9 --> 3213.309
alignment and potential alignment ship

3211.39 --> 3215.14
and other forces of when forces

3213.309 --> 3217.5690000000004
necessarily are there because it can't

3215.14 --> 3221.65
be proved to be a force but when forces

3217.569 --> 3225.579
apply alignment shift density buoyancy

3221.65 --> 3229.109
ratio the freefall neutralization and

3225.579 --> 3232.9900000000002
these are all very powerful and

3229.109 --> 3237.609
consistent operations that do heavily

3232.99 --> 3239.74
heavily suggest when you deduce it that

3237.609 --> 3244.72
there is a force this equilibrium

3239.74 --> 3249.5789999999997
present at all time and that's what

3244.72 --> 3252.7
makes it an aberration it's just this

3249.579 --> 3255.4300000000003
heavily suggestive thing happening there

3252.7 --> 3258.7
that can be bypassed completely using

3255.43 --> 3260.339
the relative density concept but yeah

3258.7 --> 3266.3489999999997
the relative density concept does not

3260.339 --> 3268.63
address the other phenomena at all it

3266.349 --> 3270.9
completely ignores it and that's just

3268.63 --> 3270.9
frustrating

3270.93 --> 3279.0389999999998
and yeah there's not gonna be any change

3274.859 --> 3280.9
in that it should recognize the other

3279.039 --> 3283.239
observations because it's not relevant

3280.9 --> 3284.079
to that that it's that simplistic it's

3283.239 --> 3290.529
that simple

3284.079 --> 3294.2490000000003
and it should be like that but yeah what

3290.529 --> 3299.519
about the aberrations what about all

3294.249 --> 3304.569
these suggestive things you [ __ ] off

3299.519 --> 3307.569
stupid piece of [ __ ] get a life or end

3304.569 --> 3309.63
it whatever I don't care either just go

3307.569 --> 3312.63
away

3309.63 --> 3312.63
wanker

3317.27 --> 3324.4
gravity aberrations and there's just

3321.77 --> 3324.4
more to it

3326.07 --> 3335.369
can be proven at anytime because we

3331.02 --> 3337.56
can't regulate this apparent force

3335.369 --> 3342.42
disequilibrium present at all time on

3337.56 --> 3346.65
the earth but yeah if at some point we

3342.42 --> 3351.48
may be able to and with influences

3346.65 --> 3353.7000000000003
directly influence what seems to be

3351.48 --> 3359.25
causing the force disequilibrium somehow

3353.7 --> 3362.31
or instead of just introducing other

3359.25 --> 3368.67
forces or motions being able to

3362.31 --> 3372.45
neutralize its effect in a way that is

3368.67 --> 3374.76
on par with how it seems to behave and

3372.45 --> 3376.56
the non detect ability of it like you

3374.76 --> 3378.48
just gonna apply electrostatics or

3376.56 --> 3381.18
magnetics then there is these remnants

3378.48 --> 3386.85
is clearly something else and you'll

3381.18 --> 3388.7999999999997
just be negating it with another concept

3386.85 --> 3391.65
you're not gonna actually vary it but

3388.8 --> 3394.59
yeah if we keep on digging and digging

3391.65 --> 3397.44
and electrics and magnetics that's where

3394.59 --> 3401.09
I presume can be found some kind of

3397.44 --> 3401.09
answer can be found from technology

3401.45 --> 3407.6499999999996
now there may be a way to ferry and

3404.66 --> 3411.319
manipulate this apparent gravity force

3407.65 --> 3415.579
bringing us closer to actually figuring

3411.319 --> 3418.0099999999998
out what causes it and thus it can be

3415.579 --> 3421.88
scientifically proven from that point on

3418.01 --> 3424.6090000000004
could be but oh my god you will see if

3421.88 --> 3428.329
that ever happens if that ever happens

3424.609 --> 3431.869
this is not a guarantee it will tie your

3428.329 --> 3433.4300000000003
flat earth apparatus and I know it's

3431.869 --> 3436.2400000000002
gonna be Nathan it's gonna be a ride

3433.43 --> 3438.97
it's gonna be ready everyone is

3436.24 --> 3442.089
instantly gonna be piling in on it

3438.97 --> 3445.0989999999997
shouting screaming which gravity

3442.089 --> 3447.109
Einstein in Newtonian mass attracting

3445.099 --> 3449.15
that lot about all of that [ __ ] and

3447.109 --> 3455.14
they're gonna attack me they're gonna

3449.15 --> 3459.65
attack me and blacksheep me potentially

3455.14 --> 3461.72
if that ever happens because they set so

3459.65 --> 3464.839
much on the relative density concept

3461.72 --> 3467.98
invested so much into it

3464.839 --> 3470.99
that they just will never accept

3467.98 --> 3473.2400000000002
scientific proof of gravity because for

3470.99 --> 3476.72
some reason the gravity concept the

3473.24 --> 3479.7799999999997
constant the apparent constant Cadden

3476.72 --> 3482.37
could be varied in a legitimate way at

3479.78 --> 3485.9100000000003
some point locally perhaps

3482.37 --> 3488.79
but yeah until that time I'm just gonna

3485.91 --> 3492.2999999999997
say it as it is gravity the aberration

3488.79 --> 3495.36
they heavily suggested gathering a

3492.3 --> 3497.57
phenomena that just suggests there is a

3495.36 --> 3501.42
force this equilibrium present heavily

3497.57 --> 3503.61
through all the duct shion's that cannot

3501.42 --> 3506.28
be proven because we cannot vary the

3503.61 --> 3508.44
independent variable of gravity but that

3506.28 --> 3509.0400000000004
doesn't mean that's gonna be like that

3508.44 --> 3512.06
forever

3509.04 --> 3512.06
there's no guarantee

3524.2 --> 3527.2
right

3529.64 --> 3536.769
but yeah whatever's going to turn out to

3532.67 --> 3539.509
be I'll bet you I'll bet you big-time

3536.769 --> 3545.359
Stein gravity is never going to be

3539.509 --> 3547.16
proven Newtonian gravity mass attracting

3545.359 --> 3549.41
mass that's

3547.16 --> 3556.97
look even Newton didn't claim a

3549.41 --> 3561.2
hypothesis okay so that's not gravity

3556.97 --> 3564.56
that's the mutation it's the the

3561.2 --> 3567.98
Frankenstein monster add-on of the

3564.56 --> 3570.44
original gravity concept of Flat Earth

3567.98 --> 3573.37
this as equilibrium in a specific

3570.44 --> 3573.37
direction

3580.91 --> 3588.6
that's what I've been saying like look

3583.44 --> 3593.4500000000003
back here and more I talked about it

3588.6 --> 3596.67
many hangouts about it it's all kind of

3593.45 --> 3600.5
sank down into the distance in the past

3596.67 --> 3604.53
but yeah it's still all counts all of it

3600.5 --> 3608.79
nothing is negated it's all still there

3604.53 --> 3612.77
it's all still counts look it back I'm

3608.79 --> 3612.77
saying the exact same thing

3615.96 --> 3620.76
right now we need physics in the

3623.44 --> 3631.51
rather Iranian analytics analysis of

3628.49 --> 3635.2599999999998
physics and and concepts and

3631.51 --> 3635.26
conceptualization structures

3638.1 --> 3643.02
you could call it our witty in theory

3640.32 --> 3644.82
because yeah it's an aberration it's

3643.02 --> 3647.15
grounded in theory not in the scientific

3644.82 --> 3647.15
method

3663.11 --> 3670.76
well the whole thing about drew mic

3666.66 --> 3675.74
dropping look that's just super

3670.76 --> 3678.3300000000004
superficial approach [ __ ]

3675.74 --> 3681.0299999999997
it was always meant for the general

3678.33 --> 3683.37
public because yeah anyone who's gonna

3681.03 --> 3686.6000000000004
set their set set their mind on gravity

3683.37 --> 3690.06
and the functions of the aberration

3686.6 --> 3694.35
technical aberration then yeah they're

3690.06 --> 3697.86
always they will have arguments to

3694.35 --> 3701.94
actually say okay yeah if you do he'll

3697.86 --> 3704.73
be in balloon then yeah the gravity will

3701.94 --> 3709.14
exert more force on that which has more

3704.73 --> 3713.73
mass pushing that down in relation to

3709.14 --> 3717.24
the lighter helium so yeah it still

3713.73 --> 3719.37
works out doesn't make it provable

3717.24 --> 3722.18
though does it make it a proven thing

3719.37 --> 3726.99
it's conceptual it's mathematical its

3722.18 --> 3732.45
structural and it works it really really

3726.99 --> 3737.0
does work but as math as a structure not

3732.45 --> 3737.0
as something that is provably there

3737.48 --> 3744.17
that's is that so difficult to

3741.6 --> 3744.17
understand

3748.589 --> 3752.64
now was it does it look like anybody's

3750.869 --> 3755.5190000000002
gonna join me on my panel if you want to

3752.64 --> 3764.249
join you're absolutely welcome though

3755.519 --> 3766.499
yeah pretty much getting to be our mark

3764.249 --> 3771.4199999999996
of my oh I already past the hour mark so

3766.499 --> 3773.249
I would have you on walls but it would

3771.42 --> 3775.609
be nice if you'd shown up a little bit

3773.249 --> 3775.609
earlier

3781.93 --> 3788.7599999999998
yeah I'm gonna call this this early bird

3789.579 --> 3798.3390000000004
gravity aberration TV all right don't

3795.669 --> 3802.439
worry peanuts Clark it's alright don't

3798.339 --> 3802.439
expect anyone to come on

3805.48 --> 3809.07
the Voynich not true

3840.16 --> 3843.16
this

3850.84 --> 3855.3
this is not what I expected

3855.36 --> 3860.1600000000003
yeah it is too late was my show starts

3858.16 --> 3862.75
an hour ago

3860.16 --> 3866.0699999999997
please should know this by now I've been

3862.75 --> 3866.07
doing it for almost half a year

3882.08 --> 3884.83
so

3884.92 --> 3888.029
no problem

3888.299 --> 3896.65
don't delete just instantly banned that

3892.299 --> 3899.23
[ __ ] to do it you can you you're allowed

3896.65 --> 3902.549
to if you make a mistake I'll just undo

3899.23 --> 3902.549
it don't worry about it

3909.63 --> 3916.079
Jimbo Joe boyo yeah that's right the

3913.9 --> 3919.509
theory of gravity is a model that's

3916.079 --> 3924.67
exactly right it's a system it's a

3919.509 --> 3932.92
structure and it works but doesn't make

3924.67 --> 3935.98
it proven but I'm glad you get that so

3932.92 --> 3939.369
yeah and Nathan's already started so I'm

3935.98 --> 3953.499
gonna round out what what are you doing

3939.369 --> 3955.69
no no I do want him hidden yeah see you

3953.499 --> 3964.569
guys all at the Flat Earth debates and

3955.69 --> 3967.4500000000003
thank you for coming thank you also for

3964.569 --> 3970.18
the wrenching assistance for the piece

3967.45 --> 3974.1699999999996
of [ __ ] troll ute that is now

3970.18 --> 3977.2
permanently banned yeah you got that you

3974.17 --> 3980.049
permanently never coming back ever I

3977.2 --> 3983.89
gave you another chance earlier and now

3980.049 --> 3985.299
it's forever definitively forever I

3983.89 --> 3986.16
don't ever want to see you here again

3985.299 --> 3991.06
ever

3986.16 --> 3995.25
okay so have fun

3991.06 --> 3999.69
whatever you do but don't have it here

3995.25 --> 3999.69
because you're gone forever now

4003.08 --> 4011.84
so yeah thank you everyone for coming

4006.56 --> 4015.23
except ute and yeah if you like the

4011.84 --> 4017.8700000000003
video then upload it and if your ute

4015.23 --> 4022.04
then download it and your thousands of

4017.87 --> 4025.0699999999997
socks I don't give a [ __ ] do whatever

4022.04 --> 4028.4
you like get a lot of down votes anyway

4025.07 --> 4033.02
trolls hate me it's good for you I'm

4028.4 --> 4033.23
gonna keep on doing this every day every

4033.02 --> 4036.1
day

4033.23 --> 4041.0
two o'clock Amsterdam time one o'clock

4036.1 --> 4041.48
London time between six and four in the

4041.0 --> 4045.04
morning

4041.48 --> 4047.51
American time and around midnight

4045.04 --> 4051.35
Australian and New Zealand time and then

4047.51 --> 4053.98
gonna keep on doing this for as long as

4051.35 --> 4059.06
I you mean Lee can and want to add

4053.98 --> 4061.88
nothing anybody else not a person is

4059.06 --> 4066.13
gonna say or do is gonna make that

4061.88 --> 4068.6600000000003
change no matter the amount of trolling

4066.13 --> 4070.9100000000003
no matter the amount of peer pressure

4068.66 --> 4073.73
from people that I do not consider to be

4070.91 --> 4076.73
trolls I will keep on doing this exactly

4073.73 --> 4081.44
how I do it there's nothing you can do

4076.73 --> 4085.33
it to stop it you can try though but I

4081.44 --> 4085.33
guarantee it's not gonna work

4085.4 --> 4094.1
so I will be back tomorrow is Flat Earth

4087.59 --> 4096.62
early bird number 132 and yeah please

4094.1 --> 4101.12
subscribe to my channel if you haven't

4096.62 --> 4103.28
already and hit the bell notification so

4101.12 --> 4105.82
you know when I'm going live which can

4103.28 --> 4109.73
be a little bit early like I did today

4105.82 --> 4113.139999999999
just like to do that sometime if you

4109.73 --> 4116.209999999999
like it I need a little bit extra room

4113.14 --> 4118.58
presumptuously before the debates start

4116.21 --> 4123.32
and I'm gonna be at the Flat Earth

4118.58 --> 4126.29
debate right after this so yeah if you

4123.32 --> 4130.82
want to support my endeavors then please

4126.29 --> 4134.95
donate to my paypal helps me a lot

4130.82 --> 4138.17
allows me to just do this show without

4134.95 --> 4143.389999999999
having to worry about money worries a

4138.17 --> 4145.91
lot and it will also help me to

4143.39 --> 4147.8
gradually get better equipment and one

4145.91 --> 4149.93
of the next thing on the list I tried it

4147.8 --> 4152.2
earlier is my microphone a new

4149.93 --> 4156.8
microphone that doesn't give the noisy

4152.2 --> 4158.99
side side noise even though it works

4156.8 --> 4161.3
really well for such a cheap like it is

4158.99 --> 4163.28
kind of bad sound quality so I am

4161.3 --> 4165.56
getting the better mic again trying to

4163.28 --> 4167.96
try again hopefully somewhere next week

4165.56 --> 4170.9800000000005
be testing it out again and this time

4167.96 --> 4173.99
it's probably not gonna be broken so

4170.98 --> 4177.219999999999
yeah donate to my paypal it'll help a

4173.99 --> 4180.219999999999
lot and it will help me progress my show

4177.22 --> 4180.22
so

4182.339 --> 4188.23
yeah contact me on skype skype address

4186.46 --> 4190.449
in the description box below you can be

4188.23 --> 4193.54
part of the panel that way we can talk

4190.449 --> 4198.19
in the background you'll see it's always

4193.54 --> 4200.23
good to contact me on skype ask me for

4198.19 --> 4203.23
advice even on things whatever you like

4200.23 --> 4206.049999999999
so I do contact me on skype I do keep

4203.23 --> 4209.0199999999995
track of everyone that I talk with on

4206.05 --> 4219.54
skype so yeah until the next Flat Earth

4209.02 --> 4219.540000000001
early bird tomorrow 132 keep it

4222.01 --> 4253.109
