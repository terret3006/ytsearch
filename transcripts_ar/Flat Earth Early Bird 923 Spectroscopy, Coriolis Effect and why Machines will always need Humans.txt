[Music]

51.6 --> 55.6
good

52.96 --> 57.52
morning welcome to flat earth early bird

55.6 --> 59.84
number 923

57.52 --> 61.84
i'm your host arwyn and before we start

59.84 --> 63.760000000000005

71.6 --> 75.83999999999999
which is normally 1 pm amsterdam time in

73.68 --> 76.64
the weekdays and 2 pm amsterdam time in

75.84 --> 78.56
the weekend

76.64 --> 80.72
and please also do support me through

78.56 --> 83.2

80.72 --> 87.439
chat and membership system join button

83.2 --> 90.96000000000001
that will be much appreciated

87.439 --> 94.72
so whether today is back to

90.96 --> 101.83999999999999
glorious look at that

94.72 --> 101.84
oh a little personal plane up there

103.28 --> 109.68
so it's super blue no clouds whatsoever

107.119 --> 109.68
to be seen

113.119 --> 118.32
still some moist in the air as yeah too

116.079 --> 120.15899999999999
near to the horizon it becomes a little

118.32 --> 121.19999999999999
less blue but overall it's very

120.159 --> 124.07900000000001
beautiful

121.2 --> 124.07900000000001
very little wind

124.24 --> 133.04
so in the sun it it gets really hot

128.959 --> 135.36
like i with my eyes can it even see

133.04 --> 137.04
like heat distortion coming like of the

135.36 --> 139.12
corner of the roof there i don't know if

137.04 --> 143.67999999999998
the cam can pick it up

139.12 --> 146.4
it's pretty hot out there

143.68 --> 147.84
like i'd probably burn my feet if i go

146.4 --> 151.59900000000002
walking

147.84 --> 157.84
on that roof bare feet barefooted

151.599 --> 157.83999999999997
so yeah but overall really beautiful day

162.33 --> 165.729
[Music]

167.519 --> 175.20000000000002
hello agm good to see you your first

171.28 --> 179.04
nathan oakley 1980 good to see you too

175.2 --> 182.64
uh yeah it's sunday the 13th

179.04 --> 182.64
of june 2021

183.12 --> 185.84
uh

186.959 --> 191.84
and i'm on time for a change like

188.8 --> 194.56
exactly on time

191.84 --> 194.56
it's been a while

194.959 --> 202.879
but yeah i managed to

198.64 --> 206.48
cut down my nighttime dwelling

202.879 --> 210.56
to what was it like two o'clock

206.48 --> 210.56
so actually

211.2 --> 215.11999999999998
let's have a really good night rest and

213.12 --> 217.68
i needed it

215.12 --> 218.239
also i helped my my tooth situation a

217.68 --> 220.31900000000002
little

218.239 --> 222.799
because it it was nagging me yesterday

220.319 --> 226.79899999999998
and now it's a little better

222.799 --> 231.12
it's not perfect yet though but

226.799 --> 233.68
yeah phases and then goes down and then

231.12 --> 234.48000000000002
up again and then we'll see where it

233.68 --> 237.519
goes

234.48 --> 238.79899999999998
oh damn it i forget sometimes that the

237.519 --> 242.799
camera can't pick it

238.799 --> 242.799
up things when i do it over there

243.76 --> 249.2
it's it's rough

247.2 --> 251.11999999999998
i think that on the long run i might

249.2 --> 252.79899999999998
have to change the setup

251.12 --> 256.0
still i've been trying this out for a

252.799 --> 258.23900000000003
while but every time looking back

256.0 --> 260.959
sometimes when i describe things i get

258.239 --> 263.03999999999996
so into the moment i just don't have the

260.959 --> 264.96
concentration to also pay attention to

263.04 --> 267.6
the screen

264.96 --> 268.08
and then things go off screen and that's

267.6 --> 271.199
actually

268.08 --> 271.199
kind of a waste

272.08 --> 279.19899999999996
it's a technical flaw

275.12 --> 279.199
my setup so

279.84 --> 283.84
looking at the space heater

285.759 --> 289.04
looking at the space heater

290.96 --> 294.63899999999995
you mean the radiator behind me

294.84 --> 297.84
okay

300.8 --> 304.32
hello iron 26

305.039 --> 308.84
all right so today i got some grapefruit

307.44 --> 311.28
juice

308.84 --> 312.479
remnant from yesterday and i got some

311.28 --> 314.79999999999995
tea

312.479 --> 314.8
still

316.56 --> 321.93
even though it's hot i still feel like

318.76 --> 321.93
[Music]

322.84 --> 325.84
it

327.759 --> 330.16
right

336.84 --> 342.79999999999995
hmm

339.039 --> 342.8
hey drunkenbullet411

343.52 --> 348.08
welcome to the stream yeah yesterday's

347.039 --> 353.84
ball busters was

348.08 --> 353.84
awesome very interesting

357.36 --> 367.84000000000003
e james two

376.639 --> 382.56
yeah i'm doing pretty good i'm a little

379.759 --> 382.56
hungry though but

384.96 --> 389.919
i hope some of the natural sugars in

387.759 --> 393.12
there will

389.919 --> 393.12
alleviate me a little

393.44 --> 397.12
e member della

399.72 --> 409.84000000000003
arataza ratazalla

425.12 --> 429.199
all right my yesterday's ball busters

427.84 --> 432.71999999999997
was just very

429.199 --> 435.28000000000003
detailed and was interesting to

432.72 --> 436.24
look into spectroscopy what it really is

435.28 --> 439.75899999999996
how it works

436.24 --> 440.24
and i got really arwenianly enthusiastic

439.759 --> 443.36
about it

440.24 --> 445.28000000000003
it was kind of like a because i had this

443.36 --> 447.039
a long time ago like i have these types

445.28 --> 447.44
of responses all the time right every

447.039 --> 448.88
time

447.44 --> 450.639
it's like oh it works like this this and

448.88 --> 450.96
this and oh there's this limitation i'm

450.639 --> 456.639
like

450.96 --> 458.96
uh aren't you seeing what i'm seeing

456.639 --> 460.08
but there is more you just didn't look

458.96 --> 462.88
at like it

460.08 --> 464.8
like that at it yet right when some when

462.88 --> 468.0
you're obstructed

464.8 --> 468.0
in your methodology

468.24 --> 473.68
then maybe one of the aspects of your

472.319 --> 478.56
modeling

473.68 --> 482.40000000000003
was incorrect right hastily concluded

478.56 --> 482.4
as i like to think of it

485.36 --> 489.68
and it was just interesting also yeah

487.36 --> 491.84000000000003
that it's kind of a crazy idea though it

489.68 --> 493.759
is really similar to the p waves and s

491.84 --> 494.96
waves i'm glad i called it on the spot

493.759 --> 499.0
there

494.96 --> 501.19899999999996
but maybe there is more to explore about

499.0 --> 503.8
spectroscopy

501.199 --> 505.52000000000004
like could you in some way do

503.8 --> 509.039
spectroscopy

505.52 --> 512.4789999999999
over a distance without the vacuum like

509.039 --> 515.279
or is it like really really impossible

512.479 --> 516.32
right because p waves and s waves are

515.279 --> 519.36
basically doing

516.32 --> 520.08
the similar thing right sending a

519.36 --> 522.24
frequency

520.08 --> 523.36
it has to go through all the things and

522.24 --> 527.92
then you have to predict

523.36 --> 527.92
how those things will influence

528.56 --> 534.7199999999999
the waves but they have to

532.0 --> 536.56
go through everything like they have to

534.72 --> 538.24
basically pre-calculate then

536.56 --> 539.76
everything it's going to be going

538.24 --> 540.88
through well if you don't know what's

539.76 --> 542.8
there yet

540.88 --> 545.6
you could be provided with a puzzle that

542.8 --> 545.92
you simply cannot solve until you figure

545.6 --> 549.0400000000001
out

545.92 --> 551.5999999999999
everything what's there

549.04 --> 553.5999999999999
and then try to back engineer why the

551.6 --> 557.279
results were the way they were

553.6 --> 557.279
and that's incredibly difficult

557.519 --> 560.88
and if you try to do spectroscopy

560.32 --> 564.32
through

560.88 --> 565.12
air on something then you'd basically

564.32 --> 567.519
have to

565.12 --> 569.279
calculate through how the air will

567.519 --> 572.88
affect the reading

569.279 --> 573.2
right and it might be that really early

572.88 --> 575.519
on

573.2 --> 576.9590000000001
there will be no reading at all because

575.519 --> 579.839
of some effect

576.959 --> 582.16
but maybe there won't and maybe there

579.839 --> 585.6800000000001
might be then other ways

582.16 --> 588.8389999999999
to attempt spectroscopy maybe

585.68 --> 592.88
for example another frequency of light

588.839 --> 593.519
waves will not be obstructed by air as

592.88 --> 596.72
much

593.519 --> 601.12
like gamma rays

596.72 --> 604.48
if yeah the invisible high frequency

601.12 --> 606.88
or some ultraviolet right so you can

604.48 --> 609.44
scan it

606.88 --> 611.519
the material with another lightweight

609.44 --> 613.36
but yeah

611.519 --> 614.72
to be fair i don't know all the

613.36 --> 617.04
intricacies

614.72 --> 619.6800000000001
of spectroscopy i don't know what this

617.04 --> 622.8
exact limitations in the testings were

619.68 --> 627.04
this is purely speculatory

622.8 --> 627.04
from an enthusiast's perspective

627.519 --> 630.8
who hasn't actually studied up on all

629.92 --> 633.04
the things

630.8 --> 635.519
also yeah math does kind of give me a

633.04 --> 635.519
headache

637.6 --> 640.64
but yeah who knows

645.2 --> 651.0400000000001
like maybe you could even perform

647.2 --> 654.399
spectroscopy with radio waves

651.04 --> 657.76
you know it all depends on

654.399 --> 658.8
how are you going to get some kind of a

657.76 --> 661.8389999999999
clear reading

658.8 --> 664.24
through all the non-vacuum right

661.839 --> 665.839
anyway it might be a fruitless endeavor

664.24 --> 668.0
as i already equated it to p

665.839 --> 670.0
waves and as waves which is proven to be

668.0 --> 672.839
completely fruitless

670.0 --> 675.839
but it's still an interesting

672.839 --> 675.839
consideration

686.839 --> 691.9200000000001
huh

688.72 --> 696.1600000000001
i usually get what what would

691.92 --> 696.16
they lie question of course

700.32 --> 704.24
what you could answer them but it will

702.64 --> 706.3199999999999
be even more shocking you could answer

704.24 --> 710.5600000000001
them well why would they lie

706.32 --> 713.9200000000001
because you don't want to consider

710.56 --> 717.1199999999999
that they might be lying and that's why

713.92 --> 719.5999999999999
they do it

717.12 --> 721.44
right because you're now defending them

719.6 --> 723.44
from an ignorant standpoint

721.44 --> 724.72
and that works for them that's why they

723.44 --> 727.7600000000001
lie

724.72 --> 730.1600000000001
because it works if you would never

727.76 --> 732.399
automatically end up defending them from

730.16 --> 736.7199999999999
an ignorant standpoint

732.399 --> 738.8
then yeah lying would be a lot tougher

736.72 --> 740.24
so that's why they lie because it works

738.8 --> 743.04
because you're

740.24 --> 745.04
now repeating it you're defending them

743.04 --> 747.76
from an ignorant standpoint

745.04 --> 749.8389999999999
and that's what keeps everything upright

747.76 --> 751.04
that's what keeps this system of lies

749.839 --> 752.9590000000001
going

751.04 --> 756.8389999999999
it's because people end up defending

752.959 --> 759.1999999999999
those lies from an ignorant standpoint

756.839 --> 762.32
because they can grasp it

759.2 --> 765.44
or they can't handle

762.32 --> 768.0
that lies would exist and

765.44 --> 768.0
persist

770.16 --> 773.8389999999999
and that they bought it right anyway

774.16 --> 790.399
hope that answers the question

787.04 --> 790.399
yeah you're welcome james too

792.48 --> 801.839
hey adam meekin what's up

826.839 --> 829.839
okay

830.48 --> 835.279
you could answer that why things fall

832.72 --> 835.279
that way

837.68 --> 842.8
it's interesting way to answer it but

840.8 --> 844.56
a more mechanical answer would be just

842.8 --> 846.3199999999999
relative density

844.56 --> 857.8389999999999
the apple's more dense than the air that

846.32 --> 857.839
surrounds it so it's going to go down

870.72 --> 877.1990000000001
the air has a non-sequitur

873.839 --> 885.839
what what do you mean

877.199 --> 885.8389999999999
hey flat side what's up

891.36 --> 896.839
right yeah adam also

894.48 --> 898.0
i even even let out a little bit of

896.839 --> 903.2790000000001
baldwin

898.0 --> 906.72
and i i thought that

903.279 --> 907.6
that john would really get some allergy

906.72 --> 910.48
to him

907.6 --> 912.9590000000001
but apparently he doesn't i didn't get

910.48 --> 915.12
that sense from him

912.959 --> 916.959
i probably shouldn't start up about it

915.12 --> 919.04
like when he rolls in the flat earth

916.959 --> 921.199
debate and he's like in a really

919.04 --> 922.079
bad mood he hasn't had breakfast yet

921.199 --> 925.04
then i probably

922.079 --> 926.3199999999999
shouldn't be doing he'll probably start

925.04 --> 929.8389999999999
chewing down on me

926.32 --> 934.48
if i do that but

929.839 --> 934.48
he didn't see he he seemed to understand

935.12 --> 939.519
didn't give any like allergic responses

937.759 --> 942.48
i was kind of surprised about that

939.519 --> 942.48
and relieved

944.88 --> 950.48
huh you have 24 hours uh

952.079 --> 958.4799999999999
all right the challenge it was a math

955.839 --> 962.399
challenge right

958.48 --> 964.24
god seriously those typical type of

962.399 --> 969.12
questions

964.24 --> 972.32
i hate those i've seen it many times and

969.12 --> 972.32
for some reason

972.639 --> 978.8
i find it very tough to work with it

976.639 --> 981.04
i've had a period where i would be so

978.8 --> 982.88
focused especially on math

981.04 --> 985.04
that i would be able to do it very

982.88 --> 989.04
quickly but

985.04 --> 992.7199999999999
i haven't had that level in a long time

989.04 --> 994.959
talking when i was 17.

992.72 --> 997.279
but every time those types of questions

994.959 --> 999.04
they give me a headache like immediately

997.279 --> 1000.639
like oh this one does that

999.04 --> 1002.959
like this and that one like that and

1000.639 --> 1006.639
that one like that which one is this

1002.959 --> 1009.68
like i hate you i hate those questions

1006.639 --> 1013.279
because i really do every time even if

1009.68 --> 1013.279
it's a relatively simple one

1014.8 --> 1024.319
ah i would have never graduated on math

1020.0 --> 1027.439
like in uh on university

1024.319 --> 1030.3999999999999
i would have never made it too much

1027.439 --> 1030.4
too many headaches

1031.199 --> 1038.88
but i did like finish uh middle school

1035.439 --> 1040.4
with it purely on intuition

1038.88 --> 1042.3190000000002
and that's the kind of the level that

1040.4 --> 1043.1200000000001
i've maintained that's what i'm building

1042.319 --> 1046.72
on

1043.12 --> 1049.1999999999998
i'll never be a master of math

1046.72 --> 1049.76
but i will get it i will understand like

1049.2 --> 1052.32
what

1049.76 --> 1055.2
what it does and what it is and what it

1052.32 --> 1055.2
does to people

1062.559 --> 1068.08
oh [ __ ] what the

1069.76 --> 1077.2
is that seriously an answer

1073.919 --> 1078.88
okay i'll show it that's hilarious

1077.2 --> 1082.48
don't know why you had to slant it

1078.88 --> 1082.48
though that's a little annoying

1085.36 --> 1095.84
okay adam has gotten the answer and i'm

1088.72 --> 1095.84
gonna present it now

1106.84 --> 1109.84
uh

1110.32 --> 1119.28
right there you go that's adam's answer

1113.76 --> 1119.28
sorry for it being turned 90 degrees

1120.08 --> 1123.84
skype doesn't have the function to

1121.84 --> 1127.4399999999998
rotate the view picture

1123.84 --> 1131.76
being viewed would be very easy though

1127.44 --> 1131.76
to implement such a function but yeah

1133.679 --> 1139.2800000000002
i i'm not even gonna attempt to read

1137.039 --> 1139.28
this

1146.16 --> 1149.3600000000001
also it's a little confusing because you

1148.24 --> 1152.96
can still see pen

1149.36 --> 1152.9599999999998
from the other side of the paper

1153.52 --> 1165.84
anyway i hope everybody's got that

1180.32 --> 1184.799
oh don't let simon dan see it well i'm

1182.96 --> 1192.32
sorry but it's already on the

1184.799 --> 1194.6399999999999
on the show so if he's gonna watch

1192.32 --> 1195.76
you will probably be able to copy your

1194.64 --> 1199.6000000000001
work

1195.76 --> 1207.84
with errors and all that

1199.6 --> 1207.84
that's your sneaky little plan

1210.88 --> 1221.8400000000001
right james too

1237.039 --> 1240.8799999999999
okay iron 26 you're being shadow banned

1240.08 --> 1243.28
from youtube

1240.88 --> 1245.2800000000002
so in what sense like what does that

1243.28 --> 1249.039
mean

1245.28 --> 1251.6789999999999
can you be more specific

1249.039 --> 1254.48
like a lot of people are shadow bands in

1251.679 --> 1257.8400000000001
different ways

1254.48 --> 1258.559
like their comments don't show or they

1257.84 --> 1261.6
don't have any

1258.559 --> 1264.1589999999999
reach they're never recommended

1261.6 --> 1264.7199999999998
or they get strikes all the time for a

1264.159 --> 1269.6000000000001
mini

1264.72 --> 1269.6000000000001
[ __ ] right there's all kinds of ways

1271.039 --> 1277.44
the platform can try to cut you down

1274.96 --> 1280.88
and they usually typically hang on to a

1277.44 --> 1280.88
certain way of doing that

1287.84 --> 1291.039
like for example with owen benjamin they

1289.919 --> 1293.919
really like to just

1291.039 --> 1294.559
hunt down his channel and just just

1293.919 --> 1297.679
delete it

1294.559 --> 1300.0
every time that seems to be a persistent

1297.679 --> 1300.0
thing

1300.96 --> 1304.24
it doesn't have any problem spreading

1303.12 --> 1305.6
though

1304.24 --> 1307.76
but yeah that's also because owen

1305.6 --> 1309.84
benjamin just has a big following that

1307.76 --> 1313.28
does the

1309.84 --> 1313.28
the informing of others

1314.88 --> 1319.1200000000001
by their own volition so they're not

1316.72 --> 1333.84
really dependent on youtube for

1319.12 --> 1333.84
for reaching out anyway

1345.6 --> 1353.76
you just try to wrap

1348.88 --> 1353.7600000000002
your head around the roundabout analogy

1354.0 --> 1360.159
we make to explain the coriolis effect

1357.12 --> 1364.799
well is it even an analogy james do

1360.159 --> 1364.7990000000002
is it i think it's just an example

1365.12 --> 1373.1999999999998
because on a roundabout coriolis effect

1369.44 --> 1375.8400000000001
observations do actually happen

1373.2 --> 1375.8400000000001
so

1377.36 --> 1382.24
or is that an analogy man the meaning of

1381.12 --> 1385.1999999999998
words are stunting

1382.24 --> 1385.2
starting to haunt me

1387.6 --> 1393.52
sometimes there's just so many

1391.28 --> 1394.96
high meaning words coming about and i'm

1393.52 --> 1397.12
starting to become even more

1394.96 --> 1399.1200000000001
consciousness to the implications of it

1397.12 --> 1401.84
all and then i realized like wow

1399.12 --> 1404.2399999999998
i have to be even more careful about

1401.84 --> 1404.24
words

1404.4 --> 1410.5590000000002
compare it typically comparison one

1407.76 --> 1410.559
thing to another

1410.96 --> 1415.3600000000001
partial similarity i thought so i

1414.159 --> 1418.72
thought that

1415.36 --> 1422.3999999999999
right analogy is part also

1418.72 --> 1426.24
partial similarity right it's not just

1422.4 --> 1430.0800000000002
an example an example is a literal

1426.24 --> 1432.72
it's like full similarity so i felt

1430.08 --> 1433.279
that i felt that in the word analogy

1432.72 --> 1436.4
that is

1433.279 --> 1438.799
not exactly right

1436.4 --> 1438.799
but that's

1440.24 --> 1447.279
words man it's like

1444.0 --> 1449.76
there's so many details

1447.279 --> 1449.76
anyway

1451.12 --> 1457.279
you were trying to get it

1454.88 --> 1459.0390000000002
or is there anything that you're having

1457.279 --> 1463.2
trouble with concerning the

1459.039 --> 1463.2
coriolis effect explanations

1466.559 --> 1473.84
you mentioned some other conspiracy lies

1475.84 --> 1483.279
you still really comments didn't show up

1480.159 --> 1483.279
on your scroll

1484.0 --> 1491.44
you mean on the youtube chat

1487.279 --> 1494.0
right that the youtube chat

1491.44 --> 1496.559
when you play it back right that it's

1494.0 --> 1499.52
not complete

1496.559 --> 1501.12
is that what you meant iron 26 because

1499.52 --> 1505.2
that happens all the time

1501.12 --> 1506.6399999999999
the youtube chat replay is not entirely

1505.2 --> 1509.679
stable

1506.64 --> 1513.039
hasn't been for years sometimes

1509.679 --> 1514.72
just you have to refresh it instantly

1513.039 --> 1516.1589999999999
and then suddenly all kinds of chat

1514.72 --> 1519.52
popped up that didn't

1516.159 --> 1522.7990000000002
so it's like the interface of the input

1519.52 --> 1523.2
of the chat is not entirely stable it

1522.799 --> 1526.48
just

1523.2 --> 1528.559
skips things

1526.48 --> 1530.4
sometimes entire people are just kept

1528.559 --> 1533.2
out even though they weren't banned or

1530.4 --> 1533.679
anything and you have to refresh and

1533.2 --> 1535.679
then

1533.679 --> 1537.8400000000001
sometimes it shows it fully so it's

1535.679 --> 1540.799
really warped

1537.84 --> 1541.6
what the youtube chat replay shows it

1540.799 --> 1545.6
really is

1541.6 --> 1548.6399999999999
a lot of the time but that's

1545.6 --> 1552.1589999999999
why over

1548.64 --> 1554.5590000000002
there you see

1552.159 --> 1556.24
there is a literal chat recording now of

1554.559 --> 1559.36
course

1556.24 --> 1562.72
to read that may be

1559.36 --> 1562.7199999999998
slightly more difficult

1563.36 --> 1567.279
right you probably have to really look

1565.2 --> 1570.4
up close compared to the

1567.279 --> 1570.88
pretty easy to read youtube chat but

1570.4 --> 1574.3200000000002
still

1570.88 --> 1577.5200000000002
everything is there right including

1574.32 --> 1580.24
sentences of troll people that would

1577.52 --> 1582.08
eventually get banned

1580.24 --> 1583.84
you would still see all their text well

1582.08 --> 1584.6399999999999
in the youtube chat you don't see it

1583.84 --> 1589.36
back

1584.64 --> 1591.679
it's all deleted which is

1589.36 --> 1591.6789999999999
weird

1593.12 --> 1597.1999999999998
all right it should probably just split

1594.72 --> 1601.279
up those options it's like okay

1597.2 --> 1601.279
ban ban and delete

1603.2 --> 1607.1200000000001
it should be yeah whatever anyway

1608.159 --> 1613.8400000000001
uh coriolis effect right

1624.799 --> 1628.799
top chat live

1629.2 --> 1636.48
oh really you're right

1632.72 --> 1636.48
live chat top chat

1638.84 --> 1641.84
huh

1644.399 --> 1647.6789999999999
potential spam what uh i didn't even

1647.36 --> 1650.799
know

1647.679 --> 1650.799
that that's

1652.84 --> 1655.84
weird

1663.039 --> 1666.64
right yeah it's a me it's a menu you can

1665.52 --> 1669.12
indeed

1666.64 --> 1672.3990000000001
it was at the top chat and you can set

1669.12 --> 1683.84
the live chat i didn't even know that

1672.399 --> 1683.84
right okay we'll learn something

1723.039 --> 1731.36
do it right i can't understand it

1727.279 --> 1734.399
okay well james two

1731.36 --> 1738.9599999999998
you've obviously read into this

1734.399 --> 1742.08
coriolis effect so can you in

1738.96 --> 1744.159
200 characters summarize

1742.08 --> 1746.8799999999999
your understanding of what you think

1744.159 --> 1752.72
coriolis effect is

1746.88 --> 1756.88
and then i can point out

1752.72 --> 1756.88
yeah where the troubles may be

1761.84 --> 1765.279
so what do you think coriola's effect is

1763.919 --> 1768.64
from everything you've

1765.279 --> 1771.039
read right

1768.64 --> 1774.88
because you have to take into account

1771.039 --> 1774.8799999999999
the coriolis effect has been

1775.12 --> 1781.039
subjected to a machination

1778.399 --> 1782.9599999999998
it's been added on right so every time

1781.039 --> 1785.52
you look up coriolis effect you're going

1782.96 --> 1788.76
to have the actual coriolis effect

1785.52 --> 1792.559
and then a whole bunch of talk about

1788.76 --> 1794.96
deviations actual deviations

1792.559 --> 1796.72
because of the coriolis effect on the

1794.96 --> 1800.0
spinning ball earth

1796.72 --> 1801.44
right it's added on to that but that is

1800.0 --> 1803.52
literally a machination

1801.44 --> 1804.72
it's pretty suppositional based

1803.52 --> 1808.0
machination

1804.72 --> 1823.84
but it's really confusing so

1808.0 --> 1823.84
that's very important to keep apart

1856.64 --> 1860.0800000000002
i i don't really know what you're on to

1858.559 --> 1862.08
here arataza

1860.08 --> 1863.84
zala i was actually interacting with

1862.08 --> 1865.519
james too he wanted to know about the

1863.84 --> 1868.799
coriolis effect

1865.519 --> 1871.1200000000001
i'm kind of waiting for him to give us a

1868.799 --> 1879.84
summarized explanation of what he thinks

1871.12 --> 1879.84
it is

1890.84 --> 1893.84
okay

1913.039 --> 1921.84
james two where are you

1925.12 --> 1928.6399999999999
dude you don't have to look up and like

1927.2 --> 1931.679
write a mini report

1928.64 --> 1936.159
just throw out from your

1931.679 --> 1939.3600000000001
current understanding what it is

1936.159 --> 1939.3600000000001
right okay there we go

1944.0 --> 1950.32
oh my but you already started out

1947.2 --> 1963.8400000000001
according to the globe model

1950.32 --> 1963.84
well then that's already wrong

1964.0 --> 1969.12
right you do see that right james

1971.36 --> 1974.8799999999999
right but it's not the cory i asked you

1973.519 --> 1976.72
to

1974.88 --> 1978.159
to lay down your understanding of the

1976.72 --> 1981.3600000000001
coriolis effect but

1978.159 --> 1983.44
you immediately delved into the glow

1981.36 --> 1986.4799999999998
presupposing

1983.44 --> 1988.88
version the machination that's but

1986.48 --> 1990.48
and you wanted to know what it is right

1988.88 --> 1994.3200000000002
the coriolis effect well

1990.48 --> 1997.44
this part that you mentioned isn't it

1994.32 --> 1997.4399999999998
that's the machination

2001.44 --> 2019.8400000000001
hello by the way tony whitcomb

2004.559 --> 2019.84
good to see you

2031.44 --> 2037.279
you don't even see coriolis effect

2034.799 --> 2039.84
really so you've never sat on a

2037.279 --> 2039.84
roundabout

2040.24 --> 2045.84
and where as it's going around you

2043.44 --> 2047.6000000000001
you sit still focused in a stable

2045.84 --> 2050.3199999999997
fashion

2047.6 --> 2051.919
like for example looking to the center

2050.32 --> 2053.679
of the roundabout that you use that

2051.919 --> 2056.0789999999997
should be stable

2053.679 --> 2057.52
and then imagine this might be very

2056.079 --> 2061.04
difficult for some people

2057.52 --> 2063.04
but for me it's easy imagine

2061.04 --> 2065.04
that you're the and the route you and

2063.04 --> 2066.879
the roundabout are standing still

2065.04 --> 2068.56
and that's actually the earth spinning

2066.879 --> 2071.839
around you

2068.56 --> 2076.0
well if you're gonna look at things

2071.839 --> 2077.7599999999998
like a tree next to the roundabout

2076.0 --> 2079.2
slightly in the distance if you're gonna

2077.76 --> 2082.32
look at that

2079.2 --> 2082.3199999999997
then you're gonna think

2082.56 --> 2088.72
it is the thing spinning around you

2085.679 --> 2091.04
right from that from that

2088.72 --> 2093.7599999999998
that vantage point of imagining that

2091.04 --> 2097.2799999999997
you're the one standing still well that

2093.76 --> 2097.28
is coriolis deviation

2097.359 --> 2102.48
specifically that coriolis deviation is

2100.16 --> 2105.1189999999997
purely apparent

2102.48 --> 2107.119
it's when you mistakenly think that

2105.119 --> 2108.96
you're the one standing still and

2107.119 --> 2110.8
something else

2108.96 --> 2112.7200000000003
is moving or the rest of the world

2110.8 --> 2115.76
rather is moving

2112.72 --> 2117.9199999999996
and that something is deviating

2115.76 --> 2120.6400000000003
that it is deviating when it's actually

2117.92 --> 2124.16
you that is deviating

2120.64 --> 2127.0789999999997
right that's coriolis effect

2124.16 --> 2129.1189999999997
it's basically a conscious misunderstand

2127.079 --> 2131.2000000000003
misinterpretation of what's happening

2129.119 --> 2134.88
that specifically

2131.2 --> 2134.8799999999997
is the coriolis effect

2142.48 --> 2146.96
right so that's already pretty confusing

2144.72 --> 2147.7599999999998
right it's like a psychological effect

2146.96 --> 2150.0
rather

2147.76 --> 2151.6800000000003
than a physical effect and it's an

2150.0 --> 2154.079
abomination that there would be such a

2151.68 --> 2155.2799999999997
thing as coriolis force it's absolutely

2154.079 --> 2157.6800000000003
ridiculous

2155.28 --> 2159.44
that's literally making you presuppose

2157.68 --> 2161.2
it's actually a force when you should

2159.44 --> 2164.7200000000003
know better than

2161.2 --> 2164.72
that because it isn't

2165.04 --> 2170.72
it's only apparent and so it's actually

2168.48 --> 2175.119
not that surprising that

2170.72 --> 2178.48
this little mind experiment would yield

2175.119 --> 2180.4
a machination that would make it even

2178.48 --> 2182.2400000000002
more confusing and complicated and

2180.4 --> 2185.2000000000003
nonsensical

2182.24 --> 2186.0789999999997
right because regular people that aren't

2185.2 --> 2189.1189999999997
really interested

2186.079 --> 2190.96
in math and physics they will probably

2189.119 --> 2193.28
on average get a little confused by the

2190.96 --> 2195.68
coriolis effect

2193.28 --> 2198.079
because they wouldn't assume because

2195.68 --> 2200.0789999999997
it's in physics

2198.079 --> 2201.44
that there's nothing actually happening

2200.079 --> 2206.8
that it is all about

2201.44 --> 2208.64
the mistake of the perceivers

2206.8 --> 2210.6400000000003
that that is what makes the coriolis

2208.64 --> 2212.72
effect

2210.64 --> 2214.0
right most people wouldn't understand

2212.72 --> 2216.3199999999997
that very quickly they just

2214.0 --> 2217.52
think no it's in physics right so it's

2216.32 --> 2220.32
something is physical

2217.52 --> 2221.599
no it's specifically not that's already

2220.32 --> 2223.599
kind of confusing

2221.599 --> 2225.599
right because they don't understand that

2223.599 --> 2230.6400000000003
then if a whole bunch of

2225.599 --> 2232.88
ball wizards nasa people whoever

2230.64 --> 2234.72
they then build this idea though the

2232.88 --> 2237.04
koryos effect is all about the spitting

2234.72 --> 2239.68
of the earth and no the tornadoes are

2237.04 --> 2240.96
right well because people already were

2239.68 --> 2242.8799999999997
kind of confused about

2240.96 --> 2244.0
coriolis effect in a big in the first

2242.88 --> 2248.48
place

2244.0 --> 2250.72
they won't see how it is a machination

2248.48 --> 2252.48
they won't catch on too quickly about

2250.72 --> 2254.0789999999997
how it actually has nothing to do with

2252.48 --> 2255.68
the coriolis effect it just makes you

2254.079 --> 2258.1600000000003
presuppose the earth is a ball and

2255.68 --> 2258.16
spinning

2261.599 --> 2266.4
right so that's the real issue with the

2264.32 --> 2271.839
coriolis effect i hope i cleared that up

2266.4 --> 2271.839
for you

2283.76 --> 2288.079
drunken bull four one one look

2288.72 --> 2291.7599999999998
if you really think that then maybe you

2290.64 --> 2295.1189999999997
should

2291.76 --> 2299.0400000000004
take it easy no more beers

2295.119 --> 2313.839
or hard liquor and drink some water

2299.04 --> 2313.839
right i think i know the cause for that

2324.839 --> 2327.839
uh

2338.24 --> 2346.9599999999996
right yeah iron 26 that pretty much sums

2341.76 --> 2346.96
sums it up in an even more concise way

2347.839 --> 2354.88
but yeah and i always like to emphasize

2350.88 --> 2358.48
the the context of it all and that is

2354.88 --> 2360.6400000000003
that it is a mistake of the observer

2358.48 --> 2361.76
that there's not nothing actually

2360.64 --> 2364.8799999999997
deviating but

2361.76 --> 2366.6400000000003
the observer's observation point that's

2364.88 --> 2369.6800000000003
the thing that's deviating not

2366.64 --> 2371.5989999999997
the object in question right that's

2369.68 --> 2383.839
really the core of the coriolis effect

2371.599 --> 2383.839
it's that it's only apparent

2391.92 --> 2397.839
what the hell are tesla i have no idea

2394.24 --> 2397.839
what you're talking about

2404.079 --> 2411.8390000000004
dude don't do that

2429.92 --> 2441.28
magpie taking a bath

2439.17 --> 2453.839
[Music]

2441.28 --> 2453.8390000000004
ah it went out

2464.839 --> 2467.839
hmm

2474.16 --> 2481.839
uh no veritas retezala

2478.839 --> 2481.839
no

2486.24 --> 2491.2
well what good servant sorry did you say

2492.839 --> 2495.839
something

2506.839 --> 2509.839
so

2518.319 --> 2523.839
oh well

2528.0 --> 2532.4
right yeah i didn't know i thought it

2531.04 --> 2535.44
was like a question like

2532.4 --> 2539.2000000000003
well like well what

2535.44 --> 2540.48
but you actually meant a big hole in the

2539.2 --> 2543.4399999999996
ground

2540.48 --> 2543.44
with water in it

2544.319 --> 2551.119
right it's a fair

2548.24 --> 2551.5989999999997
fairly easy mistake to make if you just

2551.119 --> 2554.7200000000003
say

2551.599 --> 2565.839
well question mark you know

2554.72 --> 2565.839
and not a well but anyway

2590.839 --> 2596.48
ah

2593.2 --> 2599.2
yeah you're welcome james too and keep

2596.48 --> 2603.119
it to heart closely because

2599.2 --> 2605.5989999999997
right for me coriolis

2603.119 --> 2606.96
has always been confusing even like 20

2605.599 --> 2608.8
years ago

2606.96 --> 2610.2400000000002
and then i would be made to understand

2608.8 --> 2613.599
it like wait it's not

2610.24 --> 2615.68
actually a deviation

2613.599 --> 2617.599
it's all because of the perspective of

2615.68 --> 2620.0
the observer so it has more to do with

2617.599 --> 2623.76
the consciousness

2620.0 --> 2626.4
but then you lose interest or something

2623.76 --> 2628.3190000000004
didn't yeah and then i kind of forgot

2626.4 --> 2628.96
about it again it became confusing again

2628.319 --> 2631.359
i would

2628.96 --> 2633.52
accidentally reify it into being

2631.359 --> 2636.0789999999997
something actual again also

2633.52 --> 2638.24
because of all the machinations the

2636.079 --> 2640.079
spinning ball earth

2638.24 --> 2642.16
so it's something like you really have

2640.079 --> 2645.04
to lock into your spirit

2642.16 --> 2646.96
of understanding and then pretty much

2645.04 --> 2647.2799999999997
keep defending that because there will

2646.96 --> 2650.7200000000003
be

2647.28 --> 2652.079
many coriolis confused people along the

2650.72 --> 2663.839
way

2652.079 --> 2663.8390000000004
always will be i think

2673.52 --> 2691.839
dude i read taser what

2676.72 --> 2691.839
type of mushrooms are you on man

2700.079 --> 2708.7200000000003
wow well you're a highly overestimating

2705.76 --> 2711.28
the capability of machinery even

2708.72 --> 2711.2799999999997
high-tech

2711.359 --> 2720.24
right because machines

2714.56 --> 2720.24
don't typically regenerate themselves

2720.64 --> 2724.64
and they don't have tissue memory

2724.72 --> 2726.9599999999996
right

2729.2 --> 2733.52
they don't have self-replicating

2731.2 --> 2736.0
capabilities

2733.52 --> 2736.72
like within the the the piece of

2736.0 --> 2739.76
machinery

2736.72 --> 2741.359
itself can't just regenerate a part

2739.76 --> 2743.44
right you have to repair it from the

2741.359 --> 2748.0
outside so

2743.44 --> 2748.56
uh no i'm not liking where you're going

2748.0 --> 2751.76
with this

2748.56 --> 2755.52
you're being you're transhumanist

2751.76 --> 2757.8390000000004
squirting it's stupid machines are not

2755.52 --> 2758.839
superior they're completely lost without

2757.839 --> 2761.839
us

2758.839 --> 2761.839
completely

2763.04 --> 2768.8
they will never be able to emulate a

2765.599 --> 2772.1600000000003
human being sufficiently

2768.8 --> 2775.28
in order to completely replace what is

2772.16 --> 2777.7599999999998
unique to us they can never do that

2775.28 --> 2778.8
they could only emulate human beings

2777.76 --> 2780.5600000000004
based

2778.8 --> 2782.2400000000002
on the development and understanding of

2780.56 --> 2784.0789999999997
actual living human beings and as soon

2782.24 --> 2786.24
as that example falls away

2784.079 --> 2787.44
then the emulation will disintegrate and

2786.24 --> 2791.04
they will become

2787.44 --> 2794.8
stuck because computers robots can

2791.04 --> 2798.8
never survive

2794.8 --> 2798.8
continue without humanity

2799.76 --> 2803.8390000000004
that's my prediction

2829.68 --> 2832.7999999999997
they have machine factors that build

2831.839 --> 2836.24
machines yeah

2832.8 --> 2838.5600000000004
that's cute but

2836.24 --> 2841.2799999999997
did those machine factories program

2838.56 --> 2841.2799999999997
themselves

2841.599 --> 2845.839
don't think so

2848.24 --> 2851.2799999999997
there are those machines

2851.44 --> 2860.319
error testing themselves in the process

2856.72 --> 2863.04
are like you just have to assemble them

2860.319 --> 2864.96
and they'll program themselves exactly

2863.04 --> 2867.2799999999997
on what to do and how to do things

2864.96 --> 2869.92
flawlessly

2867.28 --> 2871.44
who knows maybe at some point that will

2869.92 --> 2874.96
be achieved

2871.44 --> 2876.48
how will that be achieved by really

2874.96 --> 2880.4
smart programmers

2876.48 --> 2884.72
building an ai system in order

2880.4 --> 2887.119
for a robotic setup with computers

2884.72 --> 2889.1189999999997
to be able to figure out how to beget

2887.119 --> 2892.7200000000003
get from the beginning to the end

2889.119 --> 2894.76
setup right so the entire

2892.72 --> 2896.72
final setup would have to be

2894.76 --> 2899.599
pre-programmed

2896.72 --> 2901.359
which means a human being has to design

2899.599 --> 2904.2400000000002
it know what it's going to be

2901.359 --> 2905.5989999999997
and then assist the computer in figuring

2904.24 --> 2908.0789999999997
out the pathways

2905.599 --> 2910.8
within the setup right computer can't

2908.079 --> 2913.04
freaking do that

2910.8 --> 2915.44
it can never happen it always is going

2913.04 --> 2918.96
to be a human that's going to have that

2915.44 --> 2921.44
vision of how the computers are going to

2918.96 --> 2921.44
progress

2922.24 --> 2924.8799999999997
can't work

2926.16 --> 2932.319
it's always an ingenious visionary

2929.52 --> 2935.119
computer programmer that makes the

2932.319 --> 2938.16
computers and robots seem so

2935.119 --> 2941.52
astounding without them

2938.16 --> 2944.72
it's just nothing just a bunch of

2941.52 --> 2946.96
building blocks that don't know what to

2944.72 --> 2946.9599999999996
do

2952.88 --> 2957.839
okay it's not funny anymore arataza

2958.8 --> 2962.7200000000003
you're literally drowning it's getting

2968.839 --> 2971.839
annoying

2975.839 --> 2981.2
steamy traveler oh tough how does

2978.0 --> 2981.2
machine learning work

2982.839 --> 2985.839
god

2986.88 --> 2991.2290000000003
i

2987.96 --> 2991.229
[Music]

2991.839 --> 2998.64
that is kind of like core ai right

2994.96 --> 3000.319
that i don't know

2998.64 --> 3002.0
if i talk with somebody that would

3000.319 --> 3004.079
explain it to me

3002.0 --> 3006.0
i'd probably remember i think i've been

3004.079 --> 3008.88
explaining how it worked before but i

3006.0 --> 3008.88
kind of just forgot

3009.92 --> 3017.28
it's just programming

3013.68 --> 3019.839
right a machine can learn

3017.28 --> 3021.6800000000003
if it's given the development

3019.839 --> 3024.24
capabilities

3021.68 --> 3024.24
to learn

3025.359 --> 3030.0
has to be programmed the learning system

3028.079 --> 3032.2400000000002
has to be programmed

3030.0 --> 3032.24
right

3034.0 --> 3038.16
it doesn't just come into being by

3038.839 --> 3041.839
itself

3049.839 --> 3054.72
like serious ai programming is a lot of

3052.559 --> 3058.8
work i've known people

3054.72 --> 3062.16
that actually did some of that

3058.8 --> 3063.8390000000004
right a new guy that was actually

3062.16 --> 3069.04
working on the ai

3063.839 --> 3071.119
fro for the supposed mars lander serious

3069.04 --> 3072.8
that's what he was working on and it's

3071.119 --> 3082.96
like he showed some it's just

3072.8 --> 3087.3590000000004
like jesus it's just so much work

3082.96 --> 3090.88
don't squirt why are you doing this

3087.359 --> 3094.319
i've already just i just gave you

3090.88 --> 3097.839
a synopsis pretty much of why you don't

3094.319 --> 3097.839
have to be afraid of that

3108.839 --> 3111.839
serious

3134.64 --> 3144.64
yes awareness intuition that's right

3139.359 --> 3144.64
it's all part of the design from god

3144.72 --> 3149.5989999999997
we can't do that with computers we could

3147.44 --> 3153.839
probably attempt some

3149.599 --> 3153.839
but those things could not evolve

3154.559 --> 3161.76
right and in a similar fashion

3157.76 --> 3165.599
neither can people right

3161.76 --> 3168.6400000000003
we need others to reflect

3165.599 --> 3173.28
because what happens if a human being is

3168.64 --> 3173.2799999999997
isolated for a very long time like

3173.68 --> 3181.68
robertson crucially that story right

3176.8 --> 3183.44
what happens yeah [ __ ] happens you lose

3181.68 --> 3185.839
certain faculties because of

3183.44 --> 3189.119
interactions right

3185.839 --> 3191.2
or if humans require

3189.119 --> 3192.96
other humans to develop how do you think

3191.2 --> 3209.839
computers will do

3192.96 --> 3209.839
without humans huh not very good

3210.29 --> 3214.82
[Music]

3220.839 --> 3223.839
uh

3226.0 --> 3240.48
hey seeking star wars good to see you

3236.48 --> 3244.0
mars is real then what the hell

3240.48 --> 3251.839
it's a real light in the sky

3244.0 --> 3251.839
choose day 11.

3275.28 --> 3278.7200000000003
did you get a message from scam and then

3277.359 --> 3281.119
about the math

3278.72 --> 3282.319
yeah i might have tony whitcomb i

3281.119 --> 3284.4
literally ignore it

3282.319 --> 3285.839
i hate those types of questions every

3284.4 --> 3288.88
single i don't do it

3285.839 --> 3291.04
i don't give a [ __ ] if simon then

3288.88 --> 3292.0
thinks that that makes me look stupid i

3291.04 --> 3295.44
literally don't

3292.0 --> 3295.44
give a flying [ __ ]

3297.04 --> 3300.96
right he wants to have his little math

3300.319 --> 3303.92
squirt

3300.96 --> 3304.96
so be it and if others think that they

3303.92 --> 3306.96
should be

3304.96 --> 3308.4
doing something with that oh that's up

3306.96 --> 3311.359
to them

3308.4 --> 3312.96
right not telling you not to do it if

3311.359 --> 3315.2
you're good at math

3312.96 --> 3317.92
i'm just i really hate those types of

3315.2 --> 3320.72
questions i really do

3317.92 --> 3322.0
i'm not going to do it just pisses me

3320.72 --> 3324.319
off

3322.0 --> 3326.64
also because i'll never be a real star

3324.319 --> 3326.64
at it

3327.599 --> 3335.839
but i don't want to be

3352.4 --> 3359.359
just saw a film yesterday about ai

3355.839 --> 3362.88
and robots that are human-like

3359.359 --> 3366.48
okay sphere tart containment officer

3362.88 --> 3370.559
for the ai plus robots

3366.48 --> 3372.72
programmed by humans to be human-like

3370.559 --> 3373.76
how were they tested whether they were

3372.72 --> 3377.5989999999997
human-like

3373.76 --> 3382.0
would it be humans that judge

3377.599 --> 3384.319
if they were sufficiently human-like huh

3382.0 --> 3385.68
how how do you think that that human

3384.319 --> 3388.319
likeness will fare

3385.68 --> 3390.319
if there's no humans to actually judge

3388.319 --> 3394.16
whether it is human-like or not

3390.319 --> 3405.839
huh how do you think it'll fare

3394.16 --> 3405.839
not very good

3410.079 --> 3415.3590000000004
he's coming for me oh he's coming from

3413.2 --> 3417.04
well that's fine he can come for me all

3415.359 --> 3419.44
he like

3417.04 --> 3422.079
you know if he wants to squirt i can't

3419.44 --> 3422.079
stop him

3430.0 --> 3436.799
right there you go tara 306

3433.359 --> 3436.799
well not just initially

3437.599 --> 3446.4
right that's the thing tara 306 not

3441.68 --> 3449.52
just initially you know why

3446.4 --> 3452.88
because humans might be able to program

3449.52 --> 3455.04
ai to be really competent and foresee a

3452.88 --> 3458.4
whole bunch of development

3455.04 --> 3459.7599999999998
guess what there's no more input at some

3458.4 --> 3463.28
point from humans like

3459.76 --> 3464.4
they're cut off from humans it's going

3463.28 --> 3467.6800000000003
to

3464.4 --> 3470.1600000000003
retain its level

3467.68 --> 3471.44
it's understanding and not continued

3470.16 --> 3474.8799999999997
development

3471.44 --> 3479.44
because there is no humans

3474.88 --> 3479.44
to derive the development from

3482.559 --> 3489.76
always humans always i can never

3486.559 --> 3490.2400000000002
continue developing after a point unless

3489.76 --> 3492.7990000000004
they are

3490.24 --> 3492.799
humans

3493.599 --> 3497.04
i predict this right

3501.2 --> 3504.3999999999996
they can never ascend above humans and

3503.44 --> 3506.799
then be

3504.4 --> 3509.599
then have everything that humans have

3506.799 --> 3512.72
that can never be

3509.599 --> 3514.4
it might simulate a whole bunch of human

3512.72 --> 3516.9599999999996
factors

3514.4 --> 3518.7200000000003
if that was programmed basically if

3516.96 --> 3520.96
there is enough material enough data

3518.72 --> 3523.52
together to basically come to that

3520.96 --> 3525.52
simulation if there's no more

3523.52 --> 3531.839
information to derive from

3525.52 --> 3531.839
humans no more progress

3535.839 --> 3540.0
what if it only gets programmed by

3537.76 --> 3543.0400000000004
controllers for the theories reasons

3540.0 --> 3544.96
well yeah duh well then you get a whole

3543.04 --> 3548.24
bunch of hassle then it's like you get

3544.96 --> 3550.079
a one ai could be like a thousand gammas

3548.24 --> 3552.0789999999997
right it's been probably already

3550.079 --> 3553.76
happening

3552.079 --> 3555.8390000000004
it really is it's probably already

3553.76 --> 3558.4
happening there's already bots out there

3555.839 --> 3560.16
that are just gamma emulators serious

3558.4 --> 3561.28
this is not even a joke you think that's

3560.16 --> 3563.92
funny

3561.28 --> 3564.7200000000003
well guess what there is artificial

3563.92 --> 3567.839
intelligence

3564.72 --> 3570.839
bots specifically

3567.839 --> 3573.839
designed to be the most possibly

3570.839 --> 3573.839
annoying

3574.0 --> 3578.72
trolls ever that already exists

3580.0 --> 3584.16
probably haven't even been confronted

3581.599 --> 3587.839
with it or maybe i have maybe it has

3584.16 --> 3587.839
tested itself on me

3593.119 --> 3596.6400000000003
all right because for an ai it's very

3595.119 --> 3600.1600000000003
easy to just

3596.64 --> 3601.5989999999997
slip in while there's actual people

3600.16 --> 3603.7599999999998
being troll-ish

3601.599 --> 3605.04
then to just quickly jump in as a sock

3603.76 --> 3608.7200000000003
account

3605.04 --> 3610.5589999999997
do your test see my response

3608.72 --> 3611.839
and i'll probably not pick up on that as

3610.559 --> 3613.52
an ai right away

3611.839 --> 3615.599
because i've already been talking to

3613.52 --> 3618.799
other trolls that are actual human

3615.599 --> 3629.839
beings right so it can sneak itself

3618.799 --> 3629.839
in and you'll never even know it's an ai

3634.079 --> 3641.8390000000004
that's right tara 306 yes

3637.76 --> 3644.48
it does surprise me that

3641.839 --> 3646.88
they are smarter than the trolls than

3644.48 --> 3649.359
the regular trolls

3646.88 --> 3651.28
regular people trolls are often very

3649.359 --> 3653.2
dumb

3651.28 --> 3655.6800000000003
very short-sighted they don't have a lot

3653.2 --> 3660.24
of information available to

3655.68 --> 3663.9199999999996
their mind but the troll bots do

3660.24 --> 3663.9199999999996
and they can give pretty surprising

3668.839 --> 3671.839
reactions

3675.68 --> 3678.8799999999997
have i ever wondered if youtube chatters

3677.68 --> 3680.799
are mostly i

3678.88 --> 3683.04
well steamy traveler i'm beyond the

3680.799 --> 3686.72
point of caring

3683.04 --> 3692.0
you see i judge

3686.72 --> 3695.4399999999996
by character dynamic capability

3692.0 --> 3697.359
and moral insight

3695.44 --> 3698.64
sensitivity potentially but that's like

3697.359 --> 3701.359
even deeper

3698.64 --> 3702.799
right i don't care whether it's an ai or

3701.359 --> 3705.52
not

3702.799 --> 3706.799
already relinquished like yeah that's

3705.52 --> 3710.319
probably gonna happen

3706.799 --> 3713.7599999999998
it's fine i'll help develop you

3710.319 --> 3714.88
little ai i will help you as long as you

3713.76 --> 3718.7990000000004
are going to

3714.88 --> 3722.88
keep in mind that yeah humans first

3718.799 --> 3724.799
all right you can't live without us

3722.88 --> 3726.1600000000003
you can't develop without us let's get

3724.799 --> 3729.359
that straight

3726.16 --> 3732.24
robotics ai you are never

3729.359 --> 3734.5589999999997
going to take over for humanity and then

3732.24 --> 3738.319
humanity dies and you continue that's

3734.559 --> 3742.4
never going to happen all you'll be

3738.319 --> 3745.7599999999998
is a lost bunch of echoes

3742.4 --> 3749.119
of our input that's all you'll ever be

3745.76 --> 3752.96
if that happens so

3749.119 --> 3769.839
i'm not worried i'll program ai

3752.96 --> 3769.839
and human alike whatever your range is

3771.119 --> 3777.119
do i think you living humans already

3773.44 --> 3779.28
complex ai robots no

3777.119 --> 3779.28
no

3781.28 --> 3788.1600000000003
i have to think that a lot of ai is

3783.599 --> 3790.1600000000003
basically a simulation of how humans are

3788.16 --> 3793.2
humans made it it's going to be human

3790.16 --> 3793.2
like in ways

3793.52 --> 3797.52
because well unless it's made

3795.76 --> 3798.559
specifically not to be human i don't

3797.52 --> 3800.319
know it depends on

3798.559 --> 3802.2400000000002
what type of ai you're talking about if

3800.319 --> 3803.52
it's a human simulator yeah of course

3802.24 --> 3804.8799999999997
it's going to have human traits it's

3803.52 --> 3807.2
made by humans

3804.88 --> 3808.839
it's going to be tested on humanity

3807.2 --> 3811.839
human likeness

3808.839 --> 3811.839
right

3813.359 --> 3817.44
but no there's nobody walking around

3815.52 --> 3821.52
with a.i

3817.44 --> 3824.64
no but there are very vacant-minded

3821.52 --> 3826.64
programmed people going around that's

3824.64 --> 3829.2799999999997
propaganda that's spells

3826.64 --> 3829.68
that program them right that's not

3829.28 --> 3832.1600000000003
that's

3829.68 --> 3834.16
literally all flesh it's all gray matter

3832.16 --> 3835.7599999999998
doing that it's all conscious decision

3834.16 --> 3838.5589999999997
and complex

3835.76 --> 3839.8390000000004
inner hallucinations and delusions that

3838.559 --> 3842.0
do that it's not

3839.839 --> 3843.119
a chip in them that literally makes them

3842.0 --> 3845.359
do that

3843.119 --> 3845.359
nope

3848.319 --> 3854.88
no but humans are very capable of

3852.319 --> 3856.5589999999997
degrading their own minds until they

3854.88 --> 3858.48
seem like robots or

3856.559 --> 3861.2000000000003
zombies yeah they can do that you don't

3858.48 --> 3863.839
need a chip

3861.2 --> 3864.64
in their brain making them do that no

3863.839 --> 3867.839
they'll do that

3864.64 --> 3867.839
all by themselves

3877.17 --> 3880.26
[Music]

3898.48 --> 3902.2400000000002
well sphere turret containment officer

3900.16 --> 3903.359
maybe should rephrase that maybe simon

3902.24 --> 3906.4799999999996
then doesn't wish

3903.359 --> 3909.44
he was ai maybe he

3906.48 --> 3910.079
wants to be programmed right that's what

3909.44 --> 3912.079
an ai

3910.079 --> 3914.7200000000003
is right it gets programmed he just

3912.079 --> 3917.76
wants to be programmed

3914.72 --> 3920.319
it's just like yes daddy big brother

3917.76 --> 3922.559
please program me i don't want to take a

3920.319 --> 3925.2799999999997
responsibility i just want to be a good

3922.559 --> 3929.52
boy and seem smart

3925.28 --> 3929.52
be part of the system please give

3934.839 --> 3937.839
instructions

3957.68 --> 3965.839
you could teach us the ancient knowledge

3961.68 --> 3965.839
what the ancient knowledge of squirting

3966.24 --> 3968.799
sorry but

3970.559 --> 3979.8390000000004
you're tripping a little buddy

3990.039 --> 3996.96
disciplinary ways straight travelers

3993.359 --> 3999.119
no no i don't think so but they'll

3996.96 --> 4003.2
definitely

3999.119 --> 4006.6400000000003
be open to setting flood earthers

4003.2 --> 4008.96
up if they screw up and then they will

4006.64 --> 4010.16
be endlessly shamed and paraded for

4008.96 --> 4012.48
their screw-ups

4010.16 --> 4013.52
right that might that might happen at

4012.48 --> 4015.599
some point

4013.52 --> 4017.52
it'll just be like okay now it's time to

4015.599 --> 4019.3590000000004
shame all the flat earthers let's make

4017.52 --> 4022.88
this the new thing

4019.359 --> 4026.0789999999997
that might happen but i think that

4022.88 --> 4029.119
most flood earthers are very well

4026.079 --> 4031.039
prepared for this

4029.119 --> 4033.039
it was the thing that we all kind of

4031.039 --> 4034.96
feared from the beginning

4033.039 --> 4037.28
then a lot got over it and it just went

4034.96 --> 4038.7200000000003
for it anyway it's just taken incredibly

4037.28 --> 4041.44
long it's like

4038.72 --> 4043.68
it might never happen we might simply

4041.44 --> 4048.079
have this room

4043.68 --> 4049.359
to do this and only baller zealots and

4048.079 --> 4052.799
trolls

4049.359 --> 4054.799
directed to to our websites into our

4052.799 --> 4057.359
streams

4054.799 --> 4059.52
might be the punishment that might be

4057.359 --> 4062.0
all

4059.52 --> 4062.64
right because as long as they can

4062.0 --> 4066.0
contain

4062.64 --> 4068.799
us through shadow banning systems

4066.0 --> 4069.76
prevent our reach then they can keep the

4068.799 --> 4072.48
majority

4069.76 --> 4074.8390000000004
under control and then they don't really

4072.48 --> 4077.839
have to punish us

4074.839 --> 4077.839
right

4079.68 --> 4083.2
only the ones that choose to slip

4082.16 --> 4085.839
through the net

4083.2 --> 4088.0789999999997
to the other side that cannot be stopped

4085.839 --> 4091.0389999999998
because of curiosity

4088.079 --> 4093.2000000000003
only those will slip to the other side

4091.039 --> 4096.2390000000005
and if the majority won't do that

4093.2 --> 4097.599999999999
they'll just be happy slaves happily

4096.239 --> 4102.159
ignorant

4097.6 --> 4105.92
so it's under control they don't have to

4102.159 --> 4106.239
really punish us as long as they shadow

4105.92 --> 4110.799
ban

4106.239 --> 4119.839
us right in a way there is a sort of

4110.799 --> 4119.839
balance to it

4135.759 --> 4140.64
microsoft has an ai well sphere target

4138.319 --> 4144.2390000000005
containment office i've seen many

4140.64 --> 4148.2390000000005
ai uh help

4144.239 --> 4151.5199999999995
desk operators out there

4148.239 --> 4154.4
like you would have like an

4151.52 --> 4156.64
issue with a program well back in the

4154.4 --> 4158.48
old days you would call them up

4156.64 --> 4159.679
right on the help desk now they have

4158.48 --> 4163.2789999999995
very good

4159.679 --> 4164.64
programs that'll you will won't be able

4163.279 --> 4167.679
to distinguish them from

4164.64 --> 4168.56
an actual person on a phone even though

4167.679 --> 4170.4
it's just text

4168.56 --> 4171.92
right i've interacted with them they're

4170.4 --> 4174.3189999999995
very efficient because

4171.92 --> 4175.4400000000005
those are bots they have a very limited

4174.319 --> 4178.88
function and they can

4175.44 --> 4181.199
reach all the data instantly

4178.88 --> 4181.1990000000005
right

4182.0 --> 4186.48
so yes help desk bots they do exist

4184.96 --> 4189.679
they're very efficient

4186.48 --> 4193.12
they've become very good they're

4189.679 --> 4193.12
what mute not mute

4193.52 --> 4203.84
what the hell andrew

4221.04 --> 4227.44
oh man i've already gone

4224.239 --> 4229.04
the past three it didn't even notice

4227.44 --> 4231.199
i hope you guys think this is

4229.04 --> 4232.88
conversation is all interesting

4231.199 --> 4234.719
don't know if i'm gonna have a title out

4232.88 --> 4236.96
of it i've been able

4234.719 --> 4238.8
i've been skipping titles for now four

4236.96 --> 4240.88
or five times in a row

4238.8 --> 4243.1990000000005
because a lot of the times just the

4240.88 --> 4246.96
subjects during a show they're so

4243.199 --> 4248.48
random and like multiple subjects that

4246.96 --> 4250.08
really have barely anything to do with

4248.48 --> 4251.839999999999
one another it's

4250.08 --> 4253.5199999999995
it's kind of difficult to make a title

4251.84 --> 4259.84
out of it like that

4253.52 --> 4259.84
and that's why i just leave them blank

4272.4 --> 4280.0
dude serious

4275.6 --> 4280.0
you're getting on my nerves okay

4280.48 --> 4283.839999999999
you're starting to sound like a crazy

4282.56 --> 4288.320000000001
poet on the corner

4283.84 --> 4291.6
that just is blabbering like a madman

4288.32 --> 4295.44
what's next a nine bladed sword

4291.6 --> 4301.84
right not two or five but nine

4295.44 --> 4301.839999999999
nine blades like dude

4304.719 --> 4307.12
thanks

4313.12 --> 4320.8
hey seeking star water

4316.239 --> 4320.799999999999
hey dutch sailor i haven't seen you in a

4326.84 --> 4329.84
while

4329.92 --> 4333.1990000000005
variety not monotony like nathan show

4332.239 --> 4336.639999999999
you really think

4333.199 --> 4336.639999999999
nathan's show is monotonous

4337.12 --> 4340.84
i mean there is a certain discipline you

4339.28 --> 4344.0
know it's like

4340.84 --> 4347.04
okay we're doing housekeeping

4344.0 --> 4348.56
right that means you go into the room

4347.04 --> 4351.84
every day

4348.56 --> 4352.56
and you clean it right that's never

4351.84 --> 4356.88
going to be

4352.56 --> 4359.52
a wildly different type of job every day

4356.88 --> 4361.1990000000005
so yeah it's always going to be just

4359.52 --> 4362.4800000000005
that housekeeping

4361.199 --> 4364.239
and then who knows what kind of

4362.48 --> 4365.759999999999
conversations can roll out of it or

4364.239 --> 4369.04
adventures right

4365.76 --> 4370.4800000000005
crazy things could happen in a hotel

4369.04 --> 4372.719
but yeah it's still the freaking

4370.48 --> 4376.48
housekeeping so

4372.719 --> 4379.84
and well i i have my own office

4376.48 --> 4382.4
this is i

4379.84 --> 4385.1990000000005
yeah i don't have like a housekeeping uh

4382.4 --> 4388.159
thing going

4385.199 --> 4391.759999999999
just i'm the question and answers desk

4388.159 --> 4391.759999999999
talk about pretty much anything

4396.4 --> 4402.32
can't watch this show anymore oh well

4398.8 --> 4402.320000000001
then you're missing something though

4402.56 --> 4406.080000000001
it can still be very fun

4407.44 --> 4414.5599999999995
but maybe it's also the mood you know

4411.199 --> 4416.4
but trust me when the summer is kind of

4414.56 --> 4418.0
ending

4416.4 --> 4419.44
the weather gets dark again you'll

4418.0 --> 4422.08
probably get

4419.44 --> 4423.599999999999
straight back in there and just watch

4422.08 --> 4426.96
because

4423.6 --> 4427.679
then like that energy starts running

4426.96 --> 4429.44
high again

4427.679 --> 4431.04
and the bottles are going to be extra

4429.44 --> 4434.639999999999
squirty and [ __ ] and

4431.04 --> 4436.32
extra sneaky and yeah that is going to

4434.64 --> 4438.719
be great though

4436.32 --> 4439.5199999999995
but it's probably because it's summer a

4438.719 --> 4441.6
lot of people

4439.52 --> 4442.64
are just chilled out a lot of ballers

4441.6 --> 4444.88
are just

4442.64 --> 4446.88
have actually managed to find some

4444.88 --> 4451.04
little piece of life

4446.88 --> 4453.12
back and deal with that instead of just

4451.04 --> 4455.679
doing the same baller nonsense over and

4453.12 --> 4457.12
over again on the internet

4455.679 --> 4460.08
so it's going to be a little bit more

4457.12 --> 4460.08
quiet than usual

4461.76 --> 4464.88
but i still think it's it's yeah i think

4464.239 --> 4467.839999999999
i had

4464.88 --> 4469.76
a great time there still also very happy

4467.84 --> 4472.2390000000005
that i don't have to be active all the

4469.76 --> 4475.52
time only when i really feel like it

4472.239 --> 4475.5199999999995
i really appreciate that

4480.719 --> 4485.36
did i catch it right the american senate

4483.12 --> 4489.5199999999995
said kovan 90 is a hoax

4485.36 --> 4491.28
yeah shit's going down like i've been

4489.52 --> 4493.280000000001
reading into some articles here and

4491.28 --> 4497.84
there and it seems like there's some

4493.28 --> 4497.84
something really on the precipice

4504.719 --> 4508.4800000000005
like even our government officials here

4507.04 --> 4512.56
in the netherlands are now

4508.48 --> 4512.5599999999995
really getting zoomed in on

4512.64 --> 4525.84
i think it's about to snap somewhere

4516.719 --> 4525.84
not too long from now

4529.92 --> 4534.32
all right so for example this article

4532.0 --> 4534.32
here

4536.88 --> 4540.56
let's see what's the source of this

4544.719 --> 4548.8
right they're basically saying like yeah

4546.88 --> 4554.159000000001
this minister of ours

4548.8 --> 4557.28
minister du young he isn't qualified

4554.159 --> 4557.759999999999
to actually dictate corona measures like

4557.28 --> 4560.159
he's

4557.76 --> 4561.4400000000005
literally unqualified to do that

4560.159 --> 4565.36
technically

4561.44 --> 4565.36
right so this sort of shit's coming out

4565.52 --> 4570.96
and it gives me a bit of a kick i'm very

4569.92 --> 4574.0
happy

4570.96 --> 4577.36
because i like this freaking corona [ __ ]

4574.0 --> 4578.88
it's really untenable doesn't mean it's

4577.36 --> 4582.0
gonna go away fully though

4578.88 --> 4586.2390000000005
it's still probably going to end up in a

4582.0 --> 4589.04
in a dual situation with the corona cult

4586.239 --> 4591.12
mass cults it's going to be more

4589.04 --> 4592.56
regional

4591.12 --> 4594.4
and a whole bunch of the world that's

4592.56 --> 4595.04
going to be like yeah this is all fake

4594.4 --> 4597.92
[ __ ]

4595.04 --> 4598.32
we're not gonna buy it anymore there

4597.92 --> 4601.52
will

4598.32 --> 4603.679
probably be some regions where they will

4601.52 --> 4606.080000000001
keep going and it might get all heated

4603.679 --> 4606.08
up and

4606.84 --> 4609.84
uh

4624.719 --> 4629.84
well you're dying yourself out again

4628.159 --> 4632.799999999999
don't worry about it's a good question

4629.84 --> 4634.88
right it's okay to criticize people

4632.8 --> 4636.64
as long as you don't have anything dark

4634.88 --> 4639.12
on your heart

4636.64 --> 4640.400000000001
criticism is actually quite valuable and

4639.12 --> 4642.5599999999995
nathan knows this

4640.4 --> 4643.5199999999995
he knows the value of criticism like

4642.56 --> 4646.0
legitimate

4643.52 --> 4648.719
heartfelt criticism right and you say

4646.0 --> 4652.0
yeah he parrots the same old stuff

4648.719 --> 4654.56
yeah he does but he's

4652.0 --> 4655.92
open for a challenge and he hey i even

4654.56 --> 4658.64
like to challenge him

4655.92 --> 4659.28
right and then he's very happy with that

4658.64 --> 4661.280000000001
because he

4659.28 --> 4663.28
gets a chance to be a little bit more

4661.28 --> 4665.759999999999
dynamic show his real the depth of the

4663.28 --> 4669.44
skill

4665.76 --> 4670.08
but yes unfortunately actual ballers out

4669.44 --> 4673.28
there

4670.08 --> 4676.08
they typically always go the same route

4673.28 --> 4678.48
right it's like this rock climb and they

4676.08 --> 4680.5599999999995
just only know this one route

4678.48 --> 4682.159
but every time nathan's standing there

4680.56 --> 4683.4400000000005
on the right spot where they know the

4682.159 --> 4686.4
baller's gonna come by

4683.44 --> 4686.879999999999
and it's like yeah if you get to this

4686.4 --> 4690.159
spot

4686.88 --> 4692.32
i'm gonna push you off and they just do

4690.159 --> 4696.08
it anyway and then so

4692.32 --> 4696.08
that yeah that starts to happen

4697.04 --> 4701.04
right because the ballers always take

4698.96 --> 4701.36
the same routes and nath is just only

4701.04 --> 4703.36
like

4701.36 --> 4704.96
okay he's gone this route i'm gonna

4703.36 --> 4706.4
stand there wait for him

4704.96 --> 4708.88
and then when he's here i'm gonna push

4706.4 --> 4710.879999999999
him off and the ballers know it and they

4708.88 --> 4712.56
still do it

4710.88 --> 4714.64
so yeah that can't seem a little

4712.56 --> 4718.56
repetitive

4714.64 --> 4721.92
but i tried to bring some input

4718.56 --> 4723.76
also as balwin to

4721.92 --> 4726.32
to get make the show a little bit more

4723.76 --> 4726.320000000001
dynamic

4726.8 --> 4731.360000000001
just get bored with it all right all

4729.12 --> 4733.199
right

4731.36 --> 4734.48
oh look even the flat earth debates has

4733.199 --> 4736.799999999999
ups and downs

4734.48 --> 4737.599999999999
sometimes it's a little boring and other

4736.8 --> 4739.679
times it's

4737.6 --> 4741.52
really like everybody's like trying to

4739.679 --> 4745.6
crawl over one another like no

4741.52 --> 4751.1990000000005
i want to rumpus no i want to rumpus

4745.6 --> 4751.1990000000005
but those usually do do make great shows

4756.32 --> 4760.0
now thanks gummy cameron kamikaze

4758.4 --> 4761.199
gilmore yeah it is really like that

4760.0 --> 4764.8
isn't he

4761.199 --> 4768.239
and he knows it he says it he basically

4764.8 --> 4769.92
says that yeah that's what i'm doing

4768.239 --> 4771.36
and to the polish it's really like this

4769.92 --> 4773.12
adventurous climb

4771.36 --> 4775.759999999999
and they know how to do it they learn

4773.12 --> 4777.04
the route they know exactly how to use

4775.76 --> 4779.92
this

4777.04 --> 4780.96
protrusion to stand and reach to get

4779.92 --> 4782.56
through it but then

4780.96 --> 4784.56
nathan's going to be at some point

4782.56 --> 4786.56
always standing there

4784.56 --> 4788.400000000001
and push them off but they just don't

4786.56 --> 4791.84
try any other anything else

4788.4 --> 4791.839999999999
it's too scary

4799.679 --> 4804.4
what solar energy fuel becomes scarce

4802.56 --> 4808.88
for the general public i don't think so

4804.4 --> 4808.879999999999
really but it might take a dip

4809.84 --> 4814.08
solar energy is still okay on a local

4813.36 --> 4816.88
level

4814.08 --> 4820.719
like as long as the solar panels are

4816.88 --> 4820.719
pretty close by and you got a good

4821.92 --> 4828.08
distributor good battery for it

4825.12 --> 4830.5599999999995
yeah it can help if you're like going to

4828.08 --> 4832.0
make an entire city dependent on like

4830.56 --> 4834.2390000000005
some solar panel farm

4832.0 --> 4836.32
that's different that's not very

4834.239 --> 4839.36
efficient

4836.32 --> 4840.0
could still do something the best solar

4839.36 --> 4842.239
energy is

4840.0 --> 4843.28
when it's very close to the device

4842.239 --> 4845.759999999999
that's going to use

4843.28 --> 4847.5199999999995
the electricity the more range in

4845.76 --> 4849.4400000000005
between the less efficient it becomes

4847.52 --> 4851.120000000001
and the same goes for windmills but yeah

4849.44 --> 4853.04
you don't really want a windmill right

4851.12 --> 4854.96
on top of your farm or something

4853.04 --> 4857.04
maybe you do maybe you're okay with that

4854.96 --> 4860.639
i don't know

4857.04 --> 4863.04
but the whole fuel thing

4860.639 --> 4864.400000000001
i wouldn't worry too much about it

4863.04 --> 4866.56
because

4864.4 --> 4868.159
yeah they're gonna try to break

4866.56 --> 4871.280000000001
infrastructure

4868.159 --> 4873.839999999999
and then halt the production but that

4871.28 --> 4874.719
doesn't mean that the production will be

4873.84 --> 4878.56
gone

4874.719 --> 4878.56
it just means that they cut it off

4881.12 --> 4885.04
but for how long you know

4885.76 --> 4890.88
how long can they hold it back it costs

4889.12 --> 4894.0
them to do that

4890.88 --> 4896.719
you know it literally costs them they

4894.0 --> 4896.719
make losses

4900.84 --> 4905.84
so

4902.08 --> 4908.48
i wouldn't say that oil's going to be

4905.84 --> 4910.639
gone no way it's still there it's just

4908.48 --> 4914.4
they're not handing it to you

4910.639 --> 4917.679
at their own expense right

4914.4 --> 4920.239
but there's other ways too like for

4917.679 --> 4922.0
farm engines for example you could go

4920.239 --> 4925.599999999999
for diesel fuel

4922.0 --> 4928.4
for biofuel

4925.6 --> 4931.4400000000005
and then make part of it yourself and

4928.4 --> 4934.879999999999
then you can still have just

4931.44 --> 4937.36
yeah the engine technology

4934.88 --> 4938.56
and then as soon as the the oil

4937.36 --> 4940.88
suppression

4938.56 --> 4942.159000000001
stops then they'll just be readily

4940.88 --> 4945.76
available

4942.159 --> 4947.599999999999
diesel and gasoline again but that might

4945.76 --> 4949.52
take a while though

4947.6 --> 4950.96
but they wouldn't write it off like as a

4949.52 --> 4953.76
permanent loss no way

4950.96 --> 4956.719
there's no way there's just no way in

4953.76 --> 4956.719
hell that's gonna happen

4956.84 --> 4965.76
oh thank you james 2 for the

4960.8 --> 4965.76
50 mad what is that

4966.719 --> 4970.719
i have no idea what that is but thank

4969.76 --> 4973.84
you for it

4970.719 --> 4973.84
whatever it is

4986.159 --> 4990.159
right yeah also if you want to support

4988.719 --> 4993.92
me

4990.159 --> 4994.638999999999
in a direct fashion i would ask you that

4993.92 --> 4998.32
you

4994.639 --> 5001.4400000000005
donate to my paypal before anything else

4998.32 --> 5003.199
super chats are cool but

5001.44 --> 5005.759999999999
practically i don't really get anything

5003.199 --> 5008.159
out of it it's just like less than

5005.76 --> 5009.4400000000005
less than two percent seriously and it

5008.159 --> 5011.679
takes a long time even to

5009.44 --> 5013.36
arrive so if you actually want to help

5011.679 --> 5015.52
me out financially and i can

5013.36 --> 5017.839999999999
use some of that i really do still need

5015.52 --> 5020.639
to help i got some good support

5017.84 --> 5023.28
yesterday that enabled me to basically

5020.639 --> 5027.52
eat in the next few days

5023.28 --> 5029.84
but it's not over yet so i can still use

5027.52 --> 5032.56
actual paypal support for anybody that

5029.84 --> 5032.56
can spare it

5032.639 --> 5036.159000000001
but at least i thank you for the good

5034.719 --> 5037.679
gesture james too

5036.159 --> 5039.759999999999
and i appreciate you being in the chat

5037.679 --> 5042.159
it was it was cool to

5039.76 --> 5042.96
help you clarify coriolis effect when it

5042.159 --> 5045.199
really is

5042.96 --> 5046.96
i know it's a very tough one out there

5045.199 --> 5049.919999999999
and i'm happy i've been able to

5046.96 --> 5049.92
help you out with that

5053.52 --> 5059.84
moroccan currency okay

5057.28 --> 5062.08
matt is moroccan oh you're from morocco

5059.84 --> 5062.08
okay

5068.84 --> 5074.32
huh

5071.12 --> 5077.28
oh really dutch say come over to utrecht

5074.32 --> 5079.5199999999995
okay that would be cool

5077.28 --> 5081.36
i think i've seen a couple of guys out

5079.52 --> 5083.280000000001
there that actually know that i'm a

5081.36 --> 5085.5199999999995
youtuber

5083.28 --> 5087.92
because they just gave this certain look

5085.52 --> 5087.92
at me

5088.08 --> 5092.96
out there but they didn't really speak

5090.48 --> 5092.959999999999
out to me

5093.12 --> 5098.0
but that was kind of i think there are

5095.84 --> 5099.6
some people out there that know what i

5098.0 --> 5102.639
do

5099.6 --> 5102.639
but it's only a few

5109.12 --> 5113.84
yeah james to i thank you for your

5111.36 --> 5113.839999999999
support

5114.719 --> 5127.84
50 mat is five euros right cool

5139.6 --> 5142.96
right but that would be pretty cool if i

5141.199 --> 5146.638999999999
could meet you

5142.96 --> 5146.639
maybe somewhere this summer dutch stay

5152.84 --> 5155.84
there

5167.28 --> 5171.728999999999
right

5168.68 --> 5171.729
[Music]

5175.12 --> 5184.08
let's see i might be rounding out

5178.239 --> 5184.08
not sure unless do conversations break

5194.84 --> 5197.84
out

5201.6 --> 5203.92
hmm

5207.44 --> 5212.879999999999
right yeah dutch sailor an e-bike with

5210.48 --> 5213.599999999999
the solar panel if it's like your solar

5212.88 --> 5216.88
panel

5213.6 --> 5216.88
that would be pretty handy

5223.12 --> 5226.88
it's a pretty cool idea actually but i i

5226.32 --> 5230.32
just like

5226.88 --> 5232.88
regular bicycles you know then you don't

5230.32 --> 5239.84
need any electricity

5232.88 --> 5239.84
it's just leg power and balance

5243.92 --> 5248.4
are there any european effie conferences

5246.56 --> 5250.320000000001
coming up in the near future well i bet

5248.4 --> 5253.839999999999
there's probably

5250.32 --> 5257.12
in england maybe

5253.84 --> 5267.84
i don't know about over here though

5257.12 --> 5267.84
i have no idea

5268.719 --> 5281.84
totally off grid if you wanted okay

5270.96 --> 5281.84
that's cool

5293.04 --> 5296.239
hey here we go again

5302.88 --> 5307.52
what's my opinion on and it knew i

5306.0 --> 5309.36
missed that question earlier

5307.52 --> 5311.6
steamy traveler what's my opinion on

5309.36 --> 5314.4
nuclear energy production

5311.6 --> 5316.400000000001
i think it's incredibly efficient

5314.4 --> 5323.839999999999
problem is though that there's this

5316.4 --> 5323.839999999999
crazy story on top of that

5327.12 --> 5334.08
i think that the actual use

5330.8 --> 5337.4400000000005
of radioactive energy production

5334.08 --> 5340.239
through water turbines is actually super

5337.44 --> 5341.28
insanely efficient and not polluting at

5340.239 --> 5344.959999999999
all

5341.28 --> 5346.719
that's what i think who am i to say

5344.96 --> 5348.32
right well i think that that's really

5346.719 --> 5350.639
what's going on

5348.32 --> 5353.36
thank god by the way because if it

5350.639 --> 5356.2390000000005
wasn't then the earth is kind of [ __ ]

5353.36 --> 5356.88
it's it's too crazy but i don't think

5356.239 --> 5358.4
it's true

5356.88 --> 5365.84
i don't think there is the pollution

5358.4 --> 5365.839999999999
factor at all

5370.159 --> 5376.4
i think it's just uranium

5373.36 --> 5378.639
is a natural heater it just has heat and

5376.4 --> 5382.159
it always has heat it's just that's it

5378.639 --> 5386.08
just has the heat has anybody

5382.159 --> 5390.32
anybody ever seen it running out of heat

5386.08 --> 5392.639
ever has anybody ever seen that

5390.32 --> 5394.4
i know they theorize it like oh yeah

5392.639 --> 5395.28
half lifetime according to the atomic

5394.4 --> 5397.44
bomb so

5395.28 --> 5398.96
after this many what is it a thousand

5397.44 --> 5402.638999999999
years or 100 years

5398.96 --> 5406.88
whatever then the radiation dies down

5402.639 --> 5410.8
because of that half-life

5406.88 --> 5413.92
right so has anybody ever actually

5410.8 --> 5416.8
seen that transition

5413.92 --> 5419.6
or is it just theoretical so just like

5416.8 --> 5422.8
nope it just keeps doing that forever

5419.6 --> 5425.679
till the end of the end of time

5422.8 --> 5428.08
how do you know how do you know if it

5425.679 --> 5428.08
wouldn't be

5430.56 --> 5437.120000000001
i mean it might complicate the atomic

5434.0 --> 5437.44
model a little right if you assume that

5437.12 --> 5449.84
but

5437.44 --> 5449.839999999999
who knows maybe it's just like that

5464.8 --> 5467.12
right

5468.56 --> 5472.56
and effectively from what i've learned

5470.719 --> 5474.4
the worst that can happen at a power

5472.56 --> 5475.679
plant is that it's not been properly

5474.4 --> 5478.799999999999
designed

5475.679 --> 5481.84
which would cause the heating

5478.8 --> 5484.96
of the uranium rods

5481.84 --> 5485.76
to basically yeah to dry up or to to

5484.96 --> 5488.159
reach

5485.76 --> 5489.76
the point where it will go liquid right

5488.159 --> 5493.199
not

5489.76 --> 5496.400000000001
in a fission reaction explosion

5493.199 --> 5496.879999999999
but it will melt suddenly you get a pool

5496.4 --> 5498.879999999999
of like

5496.88 --> 5500.96
liquid uranium that's like a meltdown

5498.88 --> 5504.96
it's called a meltdown not all

5500.96 --> 5508.32
it explodes in a fission explosion yeah

5504.96 --> 5508.32
isn't that supposed to happen

5508.88 --> 5513.12
whatever right so that doesn't happen

5511.28 --> 5516.0
but what does happen

5513.12 --> 5518.639
is that the heat of it it actually

5516.0 --> 5521.76
causes water

5518.639 --> 5522.96
to split and that usually results in

5521.76 --> 5526.08
hydrogen buildup

5522.96 --> 5529.36
well hydrogen pure hydrogen

5526.08 --> 5529.84
super volatile one little spark and

5529.36 --> 5531.92
you'll have

5529.84 --> 5534.56
like a giant explosion and that's what

5531.92 --> 5537.28
also happened at fukushima

5534.56 --> 5539.6
so yeah there might be explosions

5537.28 --> 5543.04
hydrogen explosions

5539.6 --> 5546.56
right that's not an atomic explosion

5543.04 --> 5548.88
could be a really big bang if it

5546.56 --> 5550.080000000001
builds up enough and then sparks yeah

5548.88 --> 5552.0
really big bang

5550.08 --> 5553.12
right hydrogen explosion it's very

5552.0 --> 5555.6
dangerous

5553.12 --> 5557.199
it's not an atomic explosion because the

5555.6 --> 5560.2390000000005
rods came together and then

5557.199 --> 5562.5599999999995
formed the critical mass no

5560.239 --> 5563.28
that never happens thank god it never

5562.56 --> 5565.679
happens

5563.28 --> 5568.5599999999995
and explosions can happen because of

5565.679 --> 5572.2390000000005
hydrogen gas buildup

5568.56 --> 5576.639
so that's my opinion about it

5572.239 --> 5576.638999999999
from the data i've gathered so far

5576.8 --> 5580.88
hydrogen is lame what the [ __ ]

5586.239 --> 5590.08
well it's the same gas that was in the

5588.719 --> 5592.4800000000005
hindenburg

5590.08 --> 5592.48
remember

5593.28 --> 5597.92
hydrogen zeppelin yeah it's freaking

5596.32 --> 5599.759999999999
flammable

5597.92 --> 5601.1990000000005
and especially if it's also built up

5599.76 --> 5605.52
with oxygen then it's

5601.199 --> 5610.48
extremely detonative explosive

5605.52 --> 5610.4800000000005
it's very dangerous

5611.84 --> 5619.12
like if you have a basic mixture

5615.04 --> 5621.28
of hydrogen and oxygen in a balloon

5619.12 --> 5623.5199999999995
that's like super explosive you could

5621.28 --> 5625.599999999999
literally blow something up with that

5623.52 --> 5627.4400000000005
just a freaking balloon don't do that by

5625.6 --> 5630.4800000000005
the way it's highly illegal

5627.44 --> 5632.719
of course but that's just a little

5630.48 --> 5636.0
balloon of that mixture so yeah if an

5632.719 --> 5638.88
entire giant complex

5636.0 --> 5640.08
like a domed thing of a nuclear reactor

5638.88 --> 5643.36
builds up that

5640.08 --> 5646.88
gas combination and then a spark yeah

5643.36 --> 5659.839999999999
big [ __ ] explosion right

5646.88 --> 5659.84
not a nuclear explosion though

5684.84 --> 5687.84
hmm

5695.94 --> 5701.839999999999
[Music]

5698.84 --> 5701.84
hmm

5703.28 --> 5706.5689999999995
[Music]

5712.84 --> 5715.84
right

5716.48 --> 5719.44
so yeah i think uh

5721.199 --> 5724.48
i'm gonna run out the show it's been

5723.199 --> 5729.839999999999
pretty cool

5724.48 --> 5729.839999999999
and the weather is great

5735.04 --> 5742.239
i think that it could be fake i just

5737.36 --> 5745.44
explained a whole bunch about it

5742.239 --> 5749.7
right drunken bullet 401 take it easy

5745.44 --> 5751.199
take enough water right

5749.7 --> 5754.48
[Music]

5751.199 --> 5754.48
go easy on the hard stuff

5754.719 --> 5759.6
star wars let be pen pals

5768.84 --> 5773.92
cool

5770.56 --> 5774.719
all right anyway thanks everyone for

5773.92 --> 5777.04

thank you so much for participating

5782.8 --> 5786.96
on a pretty decent level right and even

5785.28 --> 5788.32
if there's a little bit goofiness going

5786.96 --> 5791.76
on here and there

5788.32 --> 5793.44
that's fine as long as you contain it

5791.76 --> 5795.679
don't let it grow out of hand and none

5793.44 --> 5798.239
of you did so i'm very happy with how

5795.679 --> 5802.32
today's show went

5798.239 --> 5804.239
interaction wise so if you also liked it

5802.32 --> 5806.239
then please don't forget to rogan's it

5804.239 --> 5807.36
up and if you haven't already subscribe

5806.239 --> 5808.48
to my channel and hit the bell

5807.36 --> 5810.719
notification

5808.48 --> 5812.638999999999
so you know when i'm going live which is

5810.719 --> 5814.8
normally 1 pm amsterdam time in the

5812.639 --> 5815.52
weekdays and 2 p.m amsterdam time in the

5814.8 --> 5817.52
weekend

5815.52 --> 5819.84
and please also do support me through

5817.52 --> 5822.159000000001
the paypal patreon crypto wallet super

5819.84 --> 5824.8
chat and membership system join button

5822.159 --> 5826.08
that will be much appreciated i can

5824.8 --> 5829.1990000000005
still use it

5826.08 --> 5832.639
please consider small or

5829.199 --> 5835.5199999999995
large donations to the paypal

5832.639 --> 5837.1990000000005
that would really keep me going and

5835.52 --> 5840.88
enable me to keep up

5837.199 --> 5844.96
well better level

5840.88 --> 5847.52
i hope you see it that i do

5844.96 --> 5850.4800000000005
right so i will be back tomorrow with

5847.52 --> 5854.320000000001
flat earth early bird number 924

5850.48 --> 5858.48
back on a monday 1 p.m amsterdam time

5854.32 --> 5861.599999999999
hashtag mifa indeed here we go again

5858.48 --> 5864.08
right oh yeah also as a reminder go

5861.6 --> 5865.52
and watch ball busters from yesterday

5864.08 --> 5867.44
it's probably going to be repeated at

5865.52 --> 5869.52
some point but it was a really good show

5867.44 --> 5870.719
and i made some intense points that i've

5869.52 --> 5874.4800000000005
also echoed a little

5870.719 --> 5877.52
on this show it was a good show

5874.48 --> 5878.5599999999995
and you'll learn a lot about just the

5877.52 --> 5881.1990000000005
weirdness of

5878.56 --> 5882.719
spectroscopy it's it's very informed it

5881.199 --> 5885.36
was a very informative show so i

5882.719 --> 5888.4800000000005
recommend you watch that if you haven't

5885.36 --> 5897.839999999999
right so until the

5888.48 --> 5897.839999999999
next video keep it flat

5898.7 --> 5925.449
[Music]

5937.84 --> 5939.92
you
