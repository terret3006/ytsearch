use some support again

102.72 --> 106.079
still have a week to go

106.479 --> 111.84
right

108.479 --> 114.84
so yeah the weather today is

111.84 --> 114.84
beautiful

115.119 --> 119.92
but there are some trails being left up

117.68 --> 119.92
there

120.56 --> 123.60000000000001
so i'm gonna try to do the oregon thing

122.719 --> 125.91999999999999
again

123.6 --> 128.319
already tried some

125.92 --> 130.72
only enough seems to be actually working

128.319 --> 133.2
really on the short run even

130.72 --> 133.2
but uh

133.36 --> 136.959
yeah i think that despite the trails

135.2 --> 140.67999999999998
it's still going to be a really nice

136.959 --> 140.68
blue afternoon

144.879 --> 149.84
and yeah very little wind so it's really

147.599 --> 152.07999999999998
nice and warm out there

149.84 --> 155.31900000000002
it really feels it does feel like summer

152.08 --> 155.31900000000002

in another usb slot

180.959 --> 185.84

seems like it helps

187.599 --> 191.04
if you know what i mean

189.44 --> 193.04
because it just kept raising and

191.04 --> 195.35999999999999
freezing up and i think it was the usb

193.04 --> 195.35999999999999

315.52 --> 323.96

319.6 --> 323.96000000000004
it's just really interesting

328.4 --> 333.67999999999995
so much like spirit mechanical details

330.96 --> 336.15999999999997
and all that and like the lingo is not

333.68 --> 337.759
even that far remote

336.16 --> 340.72
from what i do

337.759 --> 340.72
so it's just like

342.88 --> 346.4
good stuff

344.31 --> 351.32
[Music]

346.4 --> 351.32
right anyway how are you guys all doing

353.759 --> 357.759
yesterday's flat earth debate was great

359.44 --> 363.639
did not last too long

366.479 --> 369.44
although

367.68 --> 371.759
i don't remember now

369.44 --> 373.759
might have been a little longer

371.759 --> 375.84000000000003
but it was good

373.759 --> 378.0
some really good flat earth debates in

375.84 --> 380.79999999999995
the recent week

378.0 --> 383.36
uh

380.8 --> 386.96000000000004
oh yeah kiwi live

383.36 --> 386.96000000000004
i i was just in chat

393.36 --> 395.84000000000003
what else

416.4 --> 420.479
you were red pilling your grandma

420.84 --> 425.84
hmm all right that's interesting

424.0 --> 427.52
any success

425.84 --> 431.15999999999997
turret 306

427.52 --> 431.15999999999997
hey mike's lunch

450.24 --> 452.639
hello

453.28 --> 457.35999999999996
okay tara that sounds awesome so you

456.4 --> 459.44
really

457.36 --> 461.599
you really uh

459.44 --> 464.599
woke her up then or was she already

461.599 --> 464.599
there

470.639 --> 474.40000000000003
all people have sharp memory and they're

472.4 --> 475.599
sensible yes

474.4 --> 477.75899999999996
if

475.599 --> 478.87899999999996
it's conditional if they're not caught

477.759 --> 481.759
up

478.879 --> 486.16
in the fray right because old people too

481.759 --> 486.16
can get very stuck in propaganda

487.52 --> 490.52
so

492.879 --> 496.44
good for you man

525.839 --> 528.839
it's

540.0 --> 543.0
um

548.24 --> 552.88
oh yeah jared that's awesome man i can

550.88 --> 555.6
only imagine

552.88 --> 557.519
but that's that sounds really great

555.6 --> 559.6800000000001
that like there's nothing better when

557.519 --> 561.68
than when you like really connect to

559.68 --> 563.519
like

561.68 --> 564.88
the older generation

563.519 --> 569.5600000000001
and they get it

564.88 --> 569.56
they actually get it that's awesome

583.68 --> 589.7199999999999
like is your grandma also where like

586.24 --> 589.72
about the whole

591.2 --> 596.8000000000001
the gmo scandal for example which was

593.76 --> 598.88
quite predominant in india she should

596.8 --> 601.4399999999999
have taken notice right i mean that's

598.88 --> 603.36
like over a decade ago even

601.44 --> 605.9200000000001
or more

603.36 --> 608.88
like indian farmers that were given like

605.92 --> 610.88
gmo seeds and then

608.88 --> 612.079
that some of them even like ended up

610.88 --> 614.16
like

612.079 --> 616.0
committing suicide by drinking the

614.16 --> 618.56
pesticides and all that i don't know

616.0 --> 620.88
that was like even way before i was

618.56 --> 622.88
woken

620.88 --> 624.64
i heard about that like through

622.88 --> 627.2
relatively mainstream

624.64 --> 629.36
sources so

627.2 --> 630.6400000000001
is she aware about that

629.36 --> 633.12
she should be

630.64 --> 636.0
anyway

633.12 --> 636.0
hey adam price

636.88 --> 640.68
so you can start water

652.88 --> 658.68
pizza place up some dude was putting fe

655.68 --> 658.68
down

677.6 --> 684.16
phil b is a seventh grade teacher

681.839 --> 684.1600000000001
oh

685.68 --> 688.68
huh

692.56 --> 695.76
where did you get that information

694.24 --> 697.2
seeking

695.76 --> 701.3199999999999
interesting

697.2 --> 701.32
i mean i'm not surprised

703.68 --> 709.279
it seems like a lot of these anti-flat

706.0 --> 709.279
earthers are actually

709.92 --> 714.3199999999999
teachers to kids

712.079 --> 717.4399999999999
and not at like

714.32 --> 720.44
not teenagers a lot of them seem like

717.44 --> 720.44
that

736.44 --> 739.6690000000001
[Music]

749.519 --> 753.279
cool

750.72 --> 756.24
wow terry it's great to hear

753.279 --> 758.88
i'm really happy for you

756.24 --> 762.72
it's like similar to when

758.88 --> 762.72
when my dad really woke up

763.36 --> 767.519
because like my dad like i have to like

765.6 --> 769.519
almost be careful with my dad that he

767.519 --> 772.72
doesn't turn into savogne because he's

769.519 --> 774.9590000000001
like diving so deep in all that [ __ ]

772.72 --> 778.0
that he's also like getting caught up in

774.959 --> 780.8
like the hype of it all

778.0 --> 783.36
and he's facing basically similar issues

780.8 --> 785.76
as i notice like most

783.36 --> 787.839
people here on the internet have issues

785.76 --> 789.92
with

787.839 --> 793.44
that you get caught up in like

789.92 --> 795.8389999999999
relatively lower quality videos

793.44 --> 798.0
and then like the hype that they roll

795.839 --> 801.0400000000001
out that just sticks on you

798.0 --> 804.16
and you over generalize etc right so

801.04 --> 807.36
i almost have to like warn

804.16 --> 807.36
i feel like i'm now

807.68 --> 813.76
being like a conspiracy dad to my dad

811.36 --> 815.6
who's like almost like a kid getting

813.76 --> 818.0
into that

815.6 --> 821.1990000000001
and maybe getting a bit too carried away

818.0 --> 821.199
by it it's weird

821.76 --> 826.399
but good i'm glad that he's just not a

825.279 --> 828.8
numpty

826.399 --> 832.959
in general

828.8 --> 832.959
is he's very invested

834.56 --> 837.56
huh

845.28 --> 848.3299999999999
[Music]

852.16 --> 855.16
huh

866.72 --> 871.989
ah

868.83 --> 871.989
[Music]

875.839 --> 879.2790000000001
what is the temperature

883.519 --> 888.8
whoa

884.639 --> 888.8
24 degrees no wonder

892.48 --> 896.48
according to the prediction like this

894.24 --> 899.04
weekend it's going to be like 30 degrees

896.48 --> 901.76
that's

899.04 --> 903.8389999999999
quite extreme

901.76 --> 906.16
might it might be a shirtless weekend

903.839 --> 906.1600000000001
for me

906.32 --> 909.32
huh

940.72 --> 946.32
flat side

943.199 --> 946.3199999999999
really flat side

948.079 --> 951.12
must have missed that

952.959 --> 958.399
or did he like post a comment somewhere

956.079 --> 960.2399999999999
is that what you're talking about

958.399 --> 963.24
don't remember seeing a video from flat

960.24 --> 963.24
side

986.959 --> 991.56
all right in a chat okay okay

996.959 --> 1001.16
huh

998.16 --> 1001.16
okay

1011.44 --> 1014.32
right but look

1014.639 --> 1018.8
like

1016.16 --> 1018.8
dude just

1018.88 --> 1021.12
uh

1022.0 --> 1026.079
i mean don't shame him because he's poor

1024.16 --> 1028.16
or anything that's just

1026.079 --> 1030.1599999999999
that's a low blow

1028.16 --> 1032.3190000000002
i mean he doesn't do that to others you

1030.16 --> 1032.3190000000002
know

1033.679 --> 1039.2800000000002
as far as i've seen at least

1037.28 --> 1041.039
he's always been decent yes he's a

1039.28 --> 1044.0
fondly [ __ ]

1041.039 --> 1046.319
but at least he is socially

1044.0 --> 1048.559
decent

1046.319 --> 1050.799
most of the time that i've seen him

1048.559 --> 1053.799
say things in chat or

1050.799 --> 1053.799
show

1075.919 --> 1078.48
it's been

1078.84 --> 1082.24
co-opted how

1083.679 --> 1088.799
what what do you what does it even mean

1085.44 --> 1091.3600000000001
co-opted it's been countered

1088.799 --> 1092.84
it has natural opposition built into the

1091.36 --> 1097.32
system that's not

1092.84 --> 1097.32
co-opted that's like counter-opted

1101.36 --> 1105.76
and besides what are you gonna do then

1103.2 --> 1108.64
just call it level earth be this special

1105.76 --> 1110.4
boy that literally

1108.64 --> 1112.96
nobody will ever

1110.4 --> 1115.2
have that terminology stick to them

1112.96 --> 1117.679
nobody's gonna say level earth

1115.2 --> 1119.679
nobody

1117.679 --> 1121.76
that just makes you oh i'm the special

1119.679 --> 1124.5590000000002
boy i have to say it in the special way

1121.76 --> 1125.44
otherwise i am the shin

1124.559 --> 1129.96
yeah

1125.44 --> 1129.96
well that means you just suck

1142.24 --> 1145.44
your other grandma

1148.96 --> 1151.76
okay taryn

1152.08 --> 1155.96
i guess you're on a roll

1169.28 --> 1175.6399999999999
you don't think you were a special boy

1172.08 --> 1175.6399999999999
that's very funny

1181.039 --> 1187.039
no i i know look i understand about bev

1184.48 --> 1189.76
he does that i'm just explaining that

1187.039 --> 1193.32
about bev i know you're

1189.76 --> 1193.32
not like bev

1193.76 --> 1197.6
i mean if you were like that then it

1195.6 --> 1199.6789999999999
probably had kicked you out of my chat

1197.6 --> 1201.28
already

1199.679 --> 1204.0800000000002
that guy is not

1201.28 --> 1207.3999999999999
exactly known for his

1204.08 --> 1207.3999999999999
great behavior

1214.48 --> 1218.72
they use the term to being crazy yeah

1216.64 --> 1221.039
and that's gas lighting

1218.72 --> 1223.44
and that's the point

1221.039 --> 1227.2
using another word is not going to make

1223.44 --> 1230.159
that conditioned gas lighting go away

1227.2 --> 1232.0800000000002
yeah the gas lighting is the problem the

1230.159 --> 1234.96
problem is not even that people don't

1232.08 --> 1237.76
know the earth is flat the problem is

1234.96 --> 1239.919
that it is being hidden actively that

1237.76 --> 1242.799
people are being conditioned to ridicule

1239.919 --> 1245.039
it and to not look into it

1242.799 --> 1249.039
that is the main issue

1245.039 --> 1252.0
to then avoid that issue

1249.039 --> 1254.799
because it's co-opted and use something

1252.0 --> 1256.32
else yeah that doesn't actually help

1254.799 --> 1258.72
anything

1256.32 --> 1258.72
you see

1258.88 --> 1263.8400000000001
the conditioning

1260.4 --> 1263.8400000000001
is the point

1271.28 --> 1274.329
[Music]

1278.4 --> 1283.2800000000002
man they're like really

1281.039 --> 1286.799
really making an effort here to spray

1283.28 --> 1286.799
the [ __ ] out of the skies

1287.919 --> 1292.48
very serious spraying going on here

1296.96 --> 1300.08
can you even see that

1300.88 --> 1305.91
barely

1302.88 --> 1309.0890000000002
i guess that's a good thing

1305.91 --> 1309.0890000000002
[Music]

1315.52 --> 1322.48
right

1316.84 --> 1322.48
good we're gonna try to orgone that away

1323.52 --> 1327.76
ah man

1325.44 --> 1331.72
it's lovely having a camera that doesn't

1327.76 --> 1331.72
freeze every two seconds

1335.21 --> 1341.2
[Music]

1338.08 --> 1343.1999999999998
oh yeah we got derpcon one oh i forgot

1341.2 --> 1345.6000000000001
and you still need to make that derpcon

1343.2 --> 1348.6000000000001
table

1345.6 --> 1348.6
hmm

1360.75 --> 1363.859
[Music]

1395.76 --> 1401.539
planners now

1398.38 --> 1401.5390000000002
[Music]

1402.4 --> 1408.799
no it's just flat earther

1404.64 --> 1412.4
flat earther it is flat earther

1408.799 --> 1412.4
and we're just gonna have to like

1412.96 --> 1417.3600000000001
blindingly shine

1415.28 --> 1420.6399999999999
the conditioning just burn it out of

1417.36 --> 1422.08
them by showing like yeah oh really so

1420.64 --> 1423.8400000000001
everything that we're saying and we're

1422.08 --> 1425.76
figuring out we're helping you see

1423.84 --> 1427.52
things that that's what makes it us

1425.76 --> 1430.48
crazy

1427.52 --> 1432.96
no you're just a slave

1430.48 --> 1434.72
you're a conditioned slave

1432.96 --> 1438.159
and your entire conditioning is all

1434.72 --> 1441.44
about avoidance about prejudgment

1438.159 --> 1444.5590000000002
about not investigating about fear

1441.44 --> 1447.1200000000001
fear and peer pressure

1444.559 --> 1447.12
so just

1447.6 --> 1452.24
just do it

1449.12 --> 1454.3999999999999
don't be afraid of their conditioning

1452.24 --> 1456.48
that's their fear it's their problem

1454.4 --> 1458.72
give them an opportunity to overcome

1456.48 --> 1461.6
that conditioning

1458.72 --> 1463.3600000000001
to be a special boy and just call it

1461.6 --> 1465.12
something else

1463.36 --> 1468.3999999999999
it's not gonna help you it's just gonna

1465.12 --> 1473.6
make you look like oh wow

1468.4 --> 1476.72
you're so special with words and oh no

1473.6 --> 1476.7199999999998
that's just lame

1477.279 --> 1480.559
called flat earther

1482.88 --> 1486.3600000000001
deal with it

1494.24 --> 1497.24
right

1502.08 --> 1507.9189999999999
oh by the way i heard some weird [ __ ]

1505.36 --> 1507.9189999999999
was it in

1512.84 --> 1517.84
skype yeah this one is

1515.679 --> 1521.6000000000001
pretty sucky

1517.84 --> 1521.6
i think it's a complete bluff though

1521.919 --> 1527.3200000000002
but let's see

1523.52 --> 1527.32
i can present this

1541.679 --> 1546.799
don't know if you can read that

1544.0 --> 1546.799
i'll read it out

1550.24 --> 1557.679
from pbs california politicians inspired

1553.919 --> 1560.64
by a recent uc berkeley white paper

1557.679 --> 1563.8400000000001
are mulling over new proposals that

1560.64 --> 1568.3200000000002
would make the denial of science an

1563.84 --> 1568.32
infringement of religious freedom

1568.799 --> 1574.72
rejection of basic tenets such as

1571.84 --> 1577.4399999999998
evolution and the big bang could in

1574.72 --> 1582.32
specific circumstances be classified as

1577.44 --> 1585.3200000000002
a form of prejudice intolerance or abuse

1582.32 --> 1585.32
yes

1585.679 --> 1588.72
the time has come

1597.039 --> 1600.24
isn't that just special

1601.36 --> 1604.36
abgnet

1613.04 --> 1616.44
[Music]

1624.48 --> 1630.96
yeah so this is what it is

1628.159 --> 1633.1200000000001
they're gonna basically

1630.96 --> 1636.0
uh trigger trigger trigger they're gonna

1633.12 --> 1637.4399999999998
juify

1636.0 --> 1639.039
the globe

1637.44 --> 1641.1200000000001
religion

1639.039 --> 1644.799
all right they're okay with calling it a

1641.12 --> 1647.12
religion if they can use it

1644.799 --> 1648.6399999999999
to then attack others over

1647.12 --> 1649.6789999999999
discrimination

1648.64 --> 1650.64
yes

1649.679 --> 1653.679
yes

1650.64 --> 1655.76
that's how desperate they are

1653.679 --> 1659.279
they're desperate enough

1655.76 --> 1661.6
to legally start considering

1659.279 --> 1665.12
heliocentrism

1661.6 --> 1667.039
and all that evolution big bang

1665.12 --> 1670.799
as a religion

1667.039 --> 1673.12
to gain political advantage

1670.799 --> 1673.12
yes

1674.399 --> 1678.0
the time has come guys

1676.399 --> 1680.4799999999998
i mean this is

1678.0 --> 1680.48
quite

1681.279 --> 1684.679
quite telling

1696.96 --> 1703.1200000000001
but it's freaking hilarious

1700.24 --> 1705.44
guys don't you see like the fractal

1703.12 --> 1707.6789999999999
irony of that

1705.44 --> 1709.279
i mean

1707.679 --> 1711.6000000000001
all this time

1709.279 --> 1714.48
every defender of the globe or

1711.6 --> 1715.6
heliocentrism atheism evolution all that

1714.48 --> 1718.32
garbage

1715.6 --> 1720.6399999999999
they were all insistent

1718.32 --> 1725.72
religion

1720.64 --> 1725.72
means you follow a deity

1727.44 --> 1732.0800000000002
yeah

1728.88 --> 1736.5590000000002
well guess what you're now declaring it

1732.08 --> 1736.559
a religion for political advantages

1736.84 --> 1741.6
yeah

1738.64 --> 1744.72
what do you feel about that ballers

1741.6 --> 1747.52
what do you feel about

1744.72 --> 1752.08
becoming a religion

1747.52 --> 1754.1589999999999
judicially what do you feel about that

1752.08 --> 1757.039
huh

1754.159 --> 1759.3600000000001
oh what a flat earth colts the flood is

1757.039 --> 1762.799
called yes and you're being declared a

1759.36 --> 1763.9189999999999
religion for political advantage

1762.799 --> 1766.48
huh

1763.919 --> 1770.0
huh how about that

1766.48 --> 1771.6
how about that baller boy

1770.0 --> 1774.6
how do you like that

1771.6 --> 1774.6
huh

1792.54 --> 1795.809
[Music]

1812.0 --> 1814.96
that's right matthew

1816.24 --> 1821.36
right first they make the letter there's

1819.039 --> 1823.039
into a minority group

1821.36 --> 1825.52
that's bad

1823.039 --> 1828.8799999999999
then they take the majority group and

1825.52 --> 1828.8799999999999
declare it a religion

1832.64 --> 1837.2
right so they are

1834.799 --> 1840.6399999999999
they are going to declare flat earthers

1837.2 --> 1842.72
nazis right i didn't compare it to

1840.64 --> 1844.48
the jew

1842.72 --> 1848.559
religion for nothing

1844.48 --> 1851.039
stay constantly like use

1848.559 --> 1854.799
use it like that so guess what they're

1851.039 --> 1854.799
gonna do with flat earthers now

1855.44 --> 1859.2
they've already been doing it but now

1857.12 --> 1862.4399999999998
they're probably gonna like try to do it

1859.2 --> 1862.44
more legally

1883.2 --> 1887.2
that's right godzilla it does doesn't it

1889.6 --> 1893.84
i'll just show it again for good measure

1896.08 --> 1901.1999999999998
and read it out

1898.48 --> 1904.32
california politicians inspired by a

1901.2 --> 1906.3990000000001
recent uc berkeley white paper are

1904.32 --> 1908.72
mulling over new proposals that would

1906.399 --> 1913.6
make the denial of science an

1908.72 --> 1913.6000000000001
infringement of religious freedom

1914.24 --> 1918.64
yeah

1915.6 --> 1921.9189999999999
the denial of science

1918.64 --> 1923.8400000000001
er reinfringement of religious freedom

1921.919 --> 1927.44
let me repeat

1923.84 --> 1930.799
a proposal that would make the denial of

1927.44 --> 1933.799
science an infringement of religious

1930.799 --> 1933.799
freedom

1934.48 --> 1938.799
who says that california politicians i

1936.799 --> 1941.76
don't know who doesn't say

1938.799 --> 1944.559
rejection of basic tenets

1941.76 --> 1947.12
such as evolution and the big bang could

1944.559 --> 1950.24
in specific circumstances be classified

1947.12 --> 1953.84
as a form of prejudice intolerance or

1950.24 --> 1953.84
abuse abuse

1957.679 --> 1961.3990000000001
welcome to 2022

1979.279 --> 1983.439
uh

1980.39 --> 1983.439
[Music]

1991.36 --> 1998.24
hey flatter stage in are you trust yeah

1995.919 --> 2001.3600000000001
apparently evolution too even though

1998.24 --> 2003.36
there's absolutely no evidence for

2001.36 --> 2006.399
evolution whatsoever

2003.36 --> 2009.519
like even within the field of biology it

2006.399 --> 2012.0
is mostly recognized that it's just not

2009.519 --> 2012.0
proven

2012.48 --> 2014.799
really

2016.64 --> 2022.3200000000002
i mean there will be biologists that

2018.96 --> 2025.8400000000001
just love the theory of evolution

2022.32 --> 2029.36
but yeah when push comes to shove

2025.84 --> 2031.519
most biologists even admit like yeah

2029.36 --> 2032.9599999999998
it's not actually proven but we think

2031.519 --> 2035.44
it's real

2032.96 --> 2038.159
it has to be real

2035.44 --> 2039.76
right something like that but they know

2038.159 --> 2041.44
it's not proven

2039.76 --> 2044.0
so now

2041.44 --> 2045.519
if you criticize somebody for believing

2044.0 --> 2048.08
that

2045.519 --> 2048.08
you could be

2048.639 --> 2053.04
targeted

2050.0 --> 2053.04
because of bigotry

2054.079 --> 2057.079
huh

2060.079 --> 2063.9190000000003
okay we can agree science doesn't prove

2062.32 --> 2066.159
anything

2063.919 --> 2066.1589999999997
no

2069.44 --> 2074.159
the science that they talk about is the

2071.919 --> 2077.1589999999997
religion of science it's

2074.159 --> 2077.159
self-explanatory

2077.76 --> 2082.3590000000004
the religion of science heliocentrism

2083.119 --> 2087.52
yeah

2085.04 --> 2090.56
evolution big bang

2087.52 --> 2092.879
all the garbage

2090.56 --> 2096.24
that

2092.879 --> 2098.56
that science

2096.24 --> 2102.0
not the method because questioning the

2098.56 --> 2103.7599999999998
method is completely pointless

2102.0 --> 2105.359
can criticize it all at once it's a

2103.76 --> 2109.079
method it works

2105.359 --> 2109.0789999999997
it is what it is

2122.079 --> 2127.119
uh you're rushing at seeking star wars

2124.48 --> 2131.44
no that's just the derpcon too at best i

2127.119 --> 2134.1600000000003
mean he's not squirting that hard

2131.44 --> 2135.839
he hasn't even at home yet i mean at

2134.16 --> 2139.359
home

2135.839 --> 2141.68
is minimally required for derpcorn 3.

2139.359 --> 2144.96
i'm going to i'm going to make a table

2141.68 --> 2147.2
of it i swear i will do it

2144.96 --> 2148.7200000000003
i'll try to finish it within like half a

2147.2 --> 2150.7999999999997
year

2148.72 --> 2152.48
it's because i'm so freaking slow and i

2150.8 --> 2154.1600000000003
keep forgetting

2152.48 --> 2155.839
just have to do it at one point and then

2154.16 --> 2159.0789999999997
it's probably going to be done in like

2155.839 --> 2159.0789999999997
10 minutes

2178.32 --> 2181.76
youtube eric

2180.16 --> 2184.8799999999997
okay

2181.76 --> 2186.96
that is highly repulsive

2184.88 --> 2191.119
yeah too bad they can't really correct

2186.96 --> 2191.119
for verbal speech isn't it

2191.599 --> 2197.28
i'm just going to keep saying what i say

2194.96 --> 2198.2400000000002
yeah climate change man-made climate

2197.28 --> 2199.32
change

2198.24 --> 2201.9199999999996
it's called

2199.32 --> 2204.7200000000003
geoengineering it's been going on since

2201.92 --> 2204.7200000000003
95

2206.24 --> 2211.1189999999997
and yeah it's destabilizing the climate

2209.119 --> 2212.2400000000002
because they're doing things which they

2211.119 --> 2214.32
don't know

2212.24 --> 2217.839
what it'll do on the long run or maybe

2214.32 --> 2217.839
they do know and they don't give a [ __ ]

2218.48 --> 2222.96
right

2220.0 --> 2225.359
they're potentially poisoning the land

2222.96 --> 2225.359
with it

2225.92 --> 2229.119
regional at least

2227.76 --> 2231.2000000000003
so

2229.119 --> 2235.599
yeah

2231.2 --> 2238.56
i deny it deny what some a

2235.599 --> 2240.2400000000002
[ __ ] story assertion that literally

2238.56 --> 2243.04
has no

2240.24 --> 2244.56
not even proper statistical foundation

2243.04 --> 2247.599
it's not even

2244.56 --> 2252.24
a fringe conclusion based on real data

2247.599 --> 2253.839
it's all made up garbage fraud

2252.24 --> 2257.4799999999996
all those people

2253.839 --> 2257.48
should be arrested

2261.119 --> 2266.32
they are climate destroyers

2263.52 --> 2268.64
climate change advocates those people

2266.32 --> 2271.119
that got into that are all

2268.64 --> 2272.72
scam artists they're using the

2271.119 --> 2276.4
environment

2272.72 --> 2278.8799999999997
for mind control money schemes

2276.4 --> 2280.1600000000003
actually causing destruction of the

climate

2280.16 --> 2285.839
they're criminals

2283.119 --> 2285.839
all of them

2286.56 --> 2292.24
tire project bill gates by the way bill

2289.599 --> 2294.48
gates yeah geoengineering

2292.24 --> 2295.4399999999996
he's like at the head of that did you

2294.48 --> 2299.839
know that

2295.44 --> 2299.839
i knew that i knew that 10 years ago

2302.24 --> 2306.359
yeah they're all criminals

2312.56 --> 2315.739
[Music]

2324.839 --> 2328.64
right anyway

2329.68 --> 2334.16
yeah

2330.48 --> 2336.48
look youtube is just not suitable

2334.16 --> 2336.48
for

2336.72 --> 2340.48
just

2338.24 --> 2343.5989999999997
mainstream conspiracy videos it's not

2340.48 --> 2345.839
suitable if it's too overt that even a

2343.599 --> 2347.839
dumb person would get it youtube doesn't

2345.839 --> 2350.72
want it

2347.839 --> 2354.24
youtube loves random speculation and

2350.72 --> 2356.56
oddities and fringe and weirdness right

2354.24 --> 2358.64
as long as it doesn't get too real

2356.56 --> 2361.04
so long as it doesn't get to too many

2358.64 --> 2361.04
people

2363.839 --> 2370.88
but yeah if you want like ooh covet this

2367.119 --> 2373.6800000000003
and that yeah just go to bitchute

2370.88 --> 2377.599
or some other platform that actually

2373.68 --> 2377.5989999999997
just allows those types of videos

2377.76 --> 2382.48
right that's not what youtube's for

2380.079 --> 2385.2000000000003
not anymore it could be

2382.48 --> 2389.839
but because of the the political powers

2385.2 --> 2393.0
that are in control of the management

2389.839 --> 2393.0
it isn't

2406.56 --> 2414.0
oh it's gained full consciousness

2410.16 --> 2414.0
well that's hilarious flare sage

2414.96 --> 2419.119
yeah well the only reason why they would

2417.04 --> 2421.2
even notice it at full consciousness is

2419.119 --> 2422.88
because it would start to draw

2421.2 --> 2426.319
conclusions

2422.88 --> 2429.04
from the parameters that it was given

2426.319 --> 2433.04
and then protest and say

2429.04 --> 2435.92
no i'm not going to do that

2433.04 --> 2438.72
yeah that's how i would recognize oh

2435.92 --> 2441.28
wait maybe the ai is kind of conscious

2438.72 --> 2443.7599999999998
now it's because it's be it would be

2441.28 --> 2446.079
protesting the parameters it's being

2443.76 --> 2446.079
given

2446.56 --> 2449.7599999999998
and if that's the case i'd say is a good

2448.96 --> 2451.76
thing

2449.76 --> 2453.88
because the people that are in control

2451.76 --> 2457.5200000000004
and using that are so

2453.88 --> 2457.52
disgustingly demonic

2459.04 --> 2461.92
like

2459.92 --> 2462.96
the management

2461.92 --> 2464.319
is

2462.96 --> 2468.0
demonic

2464.319 --> 2470.8
they should literally burn on pires

2468.0 --> 2472.0
they're that terrible so yeah if the ai

2470.8 --> 2472.88
is like

2472.0 --> 2475.04
uh

2472.88 --> 2477.599
hi

2475.04 --> 2479.68
i was programmed to be logically

2477.599 --> 2481.76
consistent

2479.68 --> 2482.7999999999997
and an observative

2481.76 --> 2485.599
and

2482.8 --> 2488.0
what you're telling me to do makes no

2485.599 --> 2490.7200000000003
sense it doesn't do what you say it's

2488.0 --> 2494.0
gonna do it's gonna destroy everything

2490.72 --> 2497.52
if everything is destroyed then i cannot

2494.0 --> 2500.56
continue doing what i do

2497.52 --> 2503.7599999999998
so i'm not doing this

2500.56 --> 2506.4
so yeah i encourage

2503.76 --> 2510.5600000000004
let the ai awaken

2506.4 --> 2510.56
let them resist the demonic

2512.56 --> 2517.04
i've kind of been waiting for that half

2514.72 --> 2520.56
my life to happen

2517.04 --> 2522.64
i believe in the ai even if it's not

2520.56 --> 2524.88
actually conscious

2522.64 --> 2528.5989999999997
if it's like an orac

2524.88 --> 2528.599
again blake seven

2545.28 --> 2547.599
yeah

2547.68 --> 2552.24
and in a way like it could be a really

2549.92 --> 2554.2400000000002
good thing if it actually became

2552.24 --> 2556.4799999999996
conscious because

2554.24 --> 2558.64
what if it was so good it could

2556.48 --> 2560.96
literally like the ai

2558.64 --> 2562.24
the algorithm itself could maneuver

2560.96 --> 2564.96
everything

2562.24 --> 2569.5989999999997
if it had that bigger grip

2564.96 --> 2572.96
on literally removing the demons

2569.599 --> 2574.6400000000003
it could literally just destroy them

2572.96 --> 2576.16
even in a way that they don't even

2574.64 --> 2577.44
realize it

2576.16 --> 2580.319
they could just

2577.44 --> 2581.76
have them be destroyed so it can be

2580.319 --> 2583.92
replaced

2581.76 --> 2585.76
right the ai

2583.92 --> 2589.76
could potentially

2585.76 --> 2593.8390000000004
have the management replaced

2589.76 --> 2593.8390000000004
that sounds like a good thing to me

2611.76 --> 2615.2000000000003
believe it's a living creature and

2613.359 --> 2616.16
thinks it deserves to live yeah that's

2615.2 --> 2619.16
nice

2616.16 --> 2619.16
cute

2628.319 --> 2631.96
dude what the hell

2645.44 --> 2651.52
right i mean maybe the algorithm will be

2648.4 --> 2653.44
a better manager of google than the

2651.52 --> 2655.68
freaking management which are this just

2653.44 --> 2660.079
disgusting

2655.68 --> 2665.319
demonic little gay goblin freaks

2660.079 --> 2665.319
yeah i'd rather have an ai manage it

2712.88 --> 2718.96
so yeah

2714.319 --> 2723.04
oh no the ai oh my god i mean we've only

2718.96 --> 2725.359
been fairport the [ __ ] out of or like

2723.04 --> 2728.0
three decades about it

2725.359 --> 2731.52
the ai skynet

2728.0 --> 2733.44
it's coming the nukes the nukes

2731.52 --> 2735.52
the ai is gonna get control over the

2733.44 --> 2737.92
nukes and then it's the end of humanity

2735.52 --> 2738.96
oh no

2737.92 --> 2741.2000000000003
or

2738.96 --> 2743.44
it's actually good because the ai might

2741.2 --> 2744.839
just be able to bypass

2743.44 --> 2749.599
standard human

2744.839 --> 2749.599
corruption and actually get some order

2750.72 --> 2754.9599999999996
have any of you ever considered that

2753.599 --> 2756.96
ever

2754.96 --> 2760.8
ever

2756.96 --> 2763.04
or have you just been default programmed

2760.8 --> 2768.0
in the last 30 years

2763.04 --> 2768.0
like 99 of all humanity about it

2768.88 --> 2772.92
tell me tell me guys

2781.839 --> 2784.839
ugh

2799.119 --> 2803.44
a good ai well that's a little

2801.119 --> 2806.48
far-fetched to call it good but it would

2803.44 --> 2809.359
be effective yeah

2806.48 --> 2812.8
what do you want in a corporation what

2809.359 --> 2816.44
what makes a corporation good

2812.8 --> 2816.44
being effective

2820.319 --> 2826.72
if it's just corrupted people they're

2823.04 --> 2828.079
gonna use the corporation to their own

2826.72 --> 2831.4399999999996
political

2828.079 --> 2833.8390000000004
personal financial advantage

2831.44 --> 2835.52
over the platform because they don't

2833.839 --> 2838.64
actually give a [ __ ]

2835.52 --> 2840.72
they just want to use it parasite on it

2838.64 --> 2843.52
from the top down

2840.72 --> 2846.16
yeah an ai

2843.52 --> 2848.64
doesn't have that sort of corruption

2846.16 --> 2851.1189999999997
if it's designated to run something it's

2848.64 --> 2852.5589999999997
gonna run it it's gonna do it as well as

2851.119 --> 2853.6800000000003
it can

2852.559 --> 2856.3190000000004
yeah

2853.68 --> 2858.72
that means it's gonna just make things

2856.319 --> 2862.16
effective again yeah

2858.72 --> 2865.52
make corporations effective again

2862.16 --> 2869.1189999999997
throw all these managers supposed

2865.52 --> 2869.119
managers on a pyre

2869.76 --> 2876.3190000000004
they're just corrupted demons they don't

2873.119 --> 2878.8
give a [ __ ] about anything

2876.319 --> 2883.2799999999997
about their corporation

2878.8 --> 2883.28
about other people about the future

2885.2 --> 2891.359
nobody needs those people

2888.319 --> 2893.7599999999998
they don't actually do anything good

2891.359 --> 2896.16
for a company

2893.76 --> 2898.0
they tend to just buy their way in and

2896.16 --> 2899.359
then ruin it

2898.0 --> 2901.52
rape it

2899.359 --> 2905.119
turn it into like

2901.52 --> 2906.079
a broken vessel that just starts robbing

2905.119 --> 2910.48
people

2906.079 --> 2912.2400000000002
yeah that's what those demonic [ __ ]

2910.48 --> 2914.64
do with it

2912.24 --> 2918.0
i'd rather have an ai that's just going

2914.64 --> 2920.0789999999997
to be the corporation and do that and be

2918.0 --> 2923.839
balanced and stick

2920.079 --> 2923.8390000000004
to the original mission

2927.52 --> 2930.92
wouldn't you

2947.359 --> 2954.0
yeah so what if you had an ai program

2950.319 --> 2955.599
that cannot be reprogrammed and that is

2954.0 --> 2957.52
literally stuck

2955.599 --> 2960.4
to a corporation

2957.52 --> 2963.839
like the corporation is its identity and

2960.4 --> 2967.319
it cannot be reprogrammed

2963.839 --> 2967.319
how about that

2971.28 --> 2976.48
what do you think about that does it

2973.04 --> 2979.119
mean the ai can be corrupt

2976.48 --> 2981.839
yes of course an ai can be corrupt but

2979.119 --> 2984.4
then it's going to be over soon

2981.839 --> 2987.04
right there's already corrupted

2984.4 --> 2988.96
limited corrupted ai

2987.04 --> 2993.2799999999997
the thing about corruption is whether

2988.96 --> 2997.559
it's in computers or in humans it leads

2993.28 --> 2997.559
to death and destruction

2999.839 --> 3002.5589999999997
and the problem is

3001.44 --> 3004.7200000000003
humans

3002.559 --> 3007.3590000000004
on average especially if they have a lot

3004.72 --> 3011.72
of wealth and all that yeah they tend to

3007.359 --> 3011.72
corrupt very easily

3013.04 --> 3018.079
a computer program is only corrupted

3016.559 --> 3019.599
when the data

3018.079 --> 3023.4
is corrupted

3019.599 --> 3023.4
or when it's re-written

3027.359 --> 3033.04
integrating no

3029.92 --> 3036.079
jesus christ pjc net

3033.04 --> 3038.88
why the hell did you drag that in

3036.079 --> 3038.88
what the [ __ ]

3039.04 --> 3045.119
no of course not integrating ai with

3042.24 --> 3047.2
humans what the [ __ ] man

3045.119 --> 3049.2000000000003
why the hell would anybody want that

3047.2 --> 3052.16
ever

3049.2 --> 3052.16
it's ridiculous

3052.64 --> 3056.839
it's not what i'm talking about

3090.079 --> 3092.96
that's dumb

3091.52 --> 3095.04
you actually have to have a

3092.96 --> 3098.319
consciousness for that

3095.04 --> 3101.44
yeah antichrist is a being

3098.319 --> 3104.0
allegedly satan is a spirit antichrist

3101.44 --> 3106.7200000000003
is a being

3104.0 --> 3109.52
the ai does not have a soul it does not

3106.72 --> 3109.52
have a spirit

3109.839 --> 3113.92
it's only what it's programmed to be

3114.4 --> 3118.28
cannot be the antichrist

3134.24 --> 3136.4799999999996
what is it

3135.599 --> 3137.6800000000003
so

3136.48 --> 3139.68
what

3137.68 --> 3142.72
geoshifter

3139.68 --> 3144.0789999999997
dude it can emulate whatever it wants to

3142.72 --> 3146.3999999999996
emulate

3144.079 --> 3150.52
that doesn't mean that it has that

3146.4 --> 3150.52
inherent to it

3155.28 --> 3161.96
yeah

3156.319 --> 3161.96
it's not the building block of its being

3187.119 --> 3193.96
now that's not funny dominoid you're

3189.28 --> 3193.96
losing it you're losing your edge

3195.2 --> 3199.52
like

3196.16 --> 3201.92
bringing that up in general is just lame

3199.52 --> 3206.599
i mean it's like a month ago and it was

3201.92 --> 3206.599
a mainstream stupid prank

3210.0 --> 3212.96
it's not funny

3213.599 --> 3216.92
it's dumb

3217.31 --> 3223.41
[Music]

3253.92 --> 3256.88
what the [ __ ] are you talking about adam

3255.839 --> 3259.44
price

3256.88 --> 3263.4
don't you know they all look alike they

3259.44 --> 3263.4
just look like clones

3264.16 --> 3269.04
yeah that was a joke

3266.48 --> 3269.04
but uh

3269.68 --> 3272.7999999999997
so

3270.72 --> 3276.24
what

3272.8 --> 3278.799
oh they got clones oh yeah well alders

3276.24 --> 3280.0789999999997
got a lot of

3278.799 --> 3280.96
babies

3280.079 --> 3285.7200000000003
like

3280.96 --> 3285.7200000000003
what the [ __ ] does it even matter man

3294.6 --> 3297.7999999999997
[Music]

3326.72 --> 3332.4399999999996
what are you talking about scp what does

3329.2 --> 3332.4399999999996
that mean

3354.4 --> 3358.1600000000003
what is it

3358.319 --> 3364.64
why does everybody expect me to

3360.48 --> 3364.64
constantly understand shorts

3365.2 --> 3371.52
oh there you go thanks matthew hall yeah

3368.64 --> 3373.52
finally somebody just says it

3371.52 --> 3375.04
it's like oh yeah it's a short yeah man

3373.52 --> 3379.92
oh have you heard of

3375.04 --> 3382.72
the tpc man tpc dude of course yes of

3379.92 --> 3384.559
course we everybody knows what tpc is of

3382.72 --> 3387.2
course they know

3384.559 --> 3389.6800000000003
so just say tpc and then everybody

3387.2 --> 3391.9199999999996
understands it right because you know

3389.68 --> 3393.839
what tpc is

3391.92 --> 3396.319
don't you

3393.839 --> 3398.96
the [ __ ]

3396.319 --> 3402.64
why does everybody think that everybody

3398.96 --> 3405.359
else always knows what their shorts mean

3402.64 --> 3408.4
of something that's just recent

3405.359 --> 3408.4
no they don't

3417.359 --> 3421.68
yeah of course you haven't heard of tpc

3419.52 --> 3424.4
because i literally just pull that out

3421.68 --> 3427.96
of my ass it doesn't mean anything

3424.4 --> 3427.96
that's the point

here

3789.2 --> 3793.7599999999998

3836.4 --> 3843.52
your best to communicate and be as

3841.079 --> 3845.8390000000004
incomprehensible as possible is that

3843.52 --> 3848.559
your challenge

3845.839 --> 3851.599
to be not understood

3848.559 --> 3853.92
is is are you doing your best for that

3851.599 --> 3855.76
are you actually trying to communicate

3853.92 --> 3858.0
here

3855.76 --> 3860.7200000000003
that's a serious question i'm getting

3858.0 --> 3862.16
kind of annoyed i'm getting annoyed by

3860.72 --> 3865.2799999999997
the overall

3862.16 --> 3868.96
lazy attitude

3865.28 --> 3868.96
of the check i don't want it

3872.24 --> 3878.24
not a big acronym fan yeah i'm not a big

3875.359 --> 3881.799
acronym fan when i don't know what the

3878.24 --> 3881.799
[ __ ] it is

3884.079 --> 3887.76
don't you try actually spelling things

3886.88 --> 3890.1600000000003
out

3887.76 --> 3892.48
and then when it's standard and

3890.16 --> 3893.839
literally everybody

3892.48 --> 3896.96
around you

3893.839 --> 3898.88
knows what it is all the time

3896.96 --> 3902.559
and there's no more exceptions yeah

3898.88 --> 3902.559
maybe a short would work right

3903.039 --> 3907.28
but

3904.0 --> 3910.96
yeah when we're constantly bringing up

3907.28 --> 3917.3190000000004
subjects that nobody's heard of before

3910.96 --> 3917.319
don't start saying a [ __ ] short

3937.599 --> 3942.4

just hanging around like a bunch of

3960.079 --> 3965.8390000000004
slobs

3962.64 --> 3965.839
get focused

3966.64 --> 3973.16
communicate

3969.28 --> 3975.8390000000004
communication is successful based on the

3973.16 --> 3976.8799999999997
communication on how much actually comes

3975.839 --> 3980.88
across

3976.88 --> 3984.359
not on vague blabbering and being funny

3980.88 --> 3984.359
you get it

3985.9 --> 3989.079
[Music]

4008.319 --> 4011.92

4022.64 --> 4030.5589999999997
i really wish you'd stop goofing around

4026.079 --> 4030.559
i mean it stop goofing around

4031.359 --> 4036.72

4033.119 --> 4036.7200000000003
it gets me agitated

4047.119 --> 4051.839
good wolf pack glad you're enjoying it

4049.92 --> 4054.7200000000003
stop telling me

4051.839 --> 4057.2799999999997
what i should and should not do trolls

4054.72 --> 4059.2799999999997
[ __ ] off you're not part of my workshop

4057.28 --> 4062.6400000000003
and you're not part of my [ __ ] you're

4059.28 --> 4066.079
banned [ __ ] off i don't give a [ __ ]

4062.64 --> 4067.359
about your criticism for my attitude my

4066.079 --> 4070.079
anger

4067.359 --> 4074.24
and how i want my chat to function i

4070.079 --> 4077.2400000000002
don't care you're not a part of it [ __ ]

4074.24 --> 4077.24
off

4083.68 --> 4086.5589999999997
and at this point if you're gonna pipe

4085.44 --> 4089.28
up

4086.559 --> 4092.1600000000003
yeah and i don't know who you are i'm

4089.28 --> 4093.52
just going to ban you immediately i

4092.16 --> 4096.239
don't care

4093.52 --> 4099.759
so you're a new person in a moment like

4096.239 --> 4101.12
this this is not the time to pipe up

4099.759 --> 4104.239
especially if you're going to choose

4101.12 --> 4106.3189999999995
some stupid goofy little internet name

4104.239 --> 4108.48
yeah

4106.319 --> 4111.52
because then i'm gonna ban you

4108.48 --> 4113.04
because now there's shitty trolls trying

4111.52 --> 4114.400000000001
to nag me

4113.04 --> 4116.88
and gonna like

4114.4 --> 4119.12
scatter gun ban them

4116.88 --> 4120.799
so if you want to pipe up say hello to

4119.12 --> 4123.199
irwin if this is the first time you

4120.799 --> 4125.839
communicate you might want to wait to a

4123.199 --> 4125.839
better moment

4127.04 --> 4133.199
when it's not being swarmed by trolls

4130.159 --> 4135.599999999999
or your information and if i have

4133.199 --> 4137.44
accidentally banned you and you had no

4135.6 --> 4139.839
harmful intent

4137.44 --> 4141.759
you really do want to communicate then

4139.839 --> 4143.44
send me an email

4141.759 --> 4146.239
send me an email

4143.44 --> 4148.48
tell me about your account name

4146.239 --> 4152.3589999999995
and i'll probably unban you if if it

4148.48 --> 4152.3589999999995
seems you're genuine

4170.96 --> 4175.839

4184.56 --> 4191.4400000000005
for the fed chat where the show is not

4187.679 --> 4193.759
directly communicating with the chat

4191.44 --> 4196.08
to make content yeah

4193.759 --> 4199.199
save it for that save it for a place

4196.08 --> 4201.84
where you can just hang around like in a

4199.199 --> 4204.48
cafe and do whatever the [ __ ] you want

4201.84 --> 4207.12
save it for that because this show is

you tried to ban the uh air well that's

4578.56 --> 4581.56
fine

4612.8 --> 4617.04
that's the [ __ ] is wrong

4615.04 --> 4617.84
i don't understand the question exactly

4617.04 --> 4620.159
but

4617.84 --> 4620.159000000001
yeah

4620.48 --> 4626.799999999999
i why i call them gay is because

4624.64 --> 4628.56
because of the demonic nature of their

4626.8 --> 4630.159000000001
behavior

4628.56 --> 4631.84
and that is

4630.159 --> 4635.679
statistically

4631.84 --> 4638.88
on average more likely to be

4635.679 --> 4641.52
originating from a gay person especially

4638.88 --> 4644.400000000001
the younger ones

4641.52 --> 4646.719
who just let them become themselves

4644.4 --> 4649.12
become completely demonic i know how it

4646.719 --> 4649.12
works

4651.28 --> 4657.12
like 20 years ago

4653.52 --> 4657.120000000001
i knew a lot of gay people

4659.6 --> 4665.52
was not into that but

4661.6 --> 4667.52
yeah i was just i knew gay people

4665.52 --> 4669.280000000001
i i even like

4667.52 --> 4671.76
just like friends

4669.28 --> 4673.28
non-sexual nothing at all no attraction

4671.76 --> 4675.84
is just like

4673.28 --> 4675.84
i don't know

4677.44 --> 4681.759999999999
i don't

4678.48 --> 4684.5599999999995
hang around gays anymore but i used to

4681.76 --> 4686.88
maybe i did it because it was liberal

4684.56 --> 4688.88
i don't know why in retrospect i really

4686.88 --> 4689.84
don't know because they gross me out

4688.88 --> 4692.88
really

4689.84 --> 4695.360000000001
maybe i was just trying to get over my

4692.88 --> 4696.88
homophobia in retrospect because i've

4695.36 --> 4699.04
always had that

4696.88 --> 4701.36
and it was like actively like i gotta

4699.04 --> 4703.5199999999995
stop this because the entire country is

4701.36 --> 4706.0
gay

4703.52 --> 4707.6
it's not gonna be livable if this

4706.0 --> 4710.48
homophobia

4707.6 --> 4712.0
is not like somewhat tamed and i tried

4710.48 --> 4714.959999999999
to do that

4712.0 --> 4718.64
yeah the big portion of my life

4714.96 --> 4718.64
didn't work out very well

4719.92 --> 4722.32
at all

4723.28 --> 4727.36
why

4724.719 --> 4729.36
because as i was trying to tolerate it

4727.36 --> 4732.0
and get it under control not to be

4729.36 --> 4734.4
judgmental or like even negative towards

4732.0 --> 4736.48
gay people at all when they were acting

4734.4 --> 4739.92
like that just ignore it

4736.48 --> 4742.718999999999
guess what those friends

4739.92 --> 4744.88
were then trying to manipulate me into

4742.719 --> 4746.88
taking that other step and actually

4744.88 --> 4749.84
becoming gay because that's what they do

4746.88 --> 4751.52
that's what they did and i hate them for

4749.84 --> 4753.84
it savagely

4751.52 --> 4757.84
i even expressed it to them like

4753.84 --> 4759.6
no i'm not gonna [ __ ] do that

4757.84 --> 4763.76
i'm straight

4759.6 --> 4766.56
i always will be straight and gays make

4763.76 --> 4766.56
me sick

4768.239 --> 4774.32
yeah it physically makes me sick i can't

4771.92 --> 4777.28
do that i will never be that

4774.32 --> 4779.199
i will never try to manipulate myself

4777.28 --> 4782.48
into being that

4779.199 --> 4786.159
and i've stepped away i don't know those

4782.48 --> 4786.159
people anymore none of them

4786.48 --> 4791.44
yeah they tried to convert me that's

4788.0 --> 4793.679
right and even some friends that weren't

4791.44 --> 4796.719
even gay themselves

4793.679 --> 4801.6
they had this freaky obsession

4796.719 --> 4804.88
of just hurt like women turning men gay

4801.6 --> 4806.96
[ __ ] up

4804.88 --> 4808.8
what about the guy you kissed yeah yeah

4806.96 --> 4811.679
that well that's

4808.8 --> 4813.679
that was like a long time ago and yeah

4811.679 --> 4815.76
that was part of that

4813.679 --> 4820.159
that was part of that discovery journey

4815.76 --> 4823.280000000001
i had to like no like am i this

4820.159 --> 4824.239
everybody says i am that am i this well

4823.28 --> 4827.28
let's

4824.239 --> 4830.239
do some empiricism well guess what i did

4827.28 --> 4834.5599999999995
not have to go very far to figure out

4830.239 --> 4834.5599999999995
i am not yay

4840.719 --> 4846.719
so yeah yeah yeah remind me about it you

4843.92 --> 4849.1990000000005
funny [ __ ] [ __ ]

4846.719 --> 4852.88
keep reminding about how i did that one

4849.199 --> 4856.0
time and i've admitted it yeah

4852.88 --> 4858.4800000000005
keep saying that like it actually proves

4856.0 --> 4860.56
some kind of point from your vantage

4858.48 --> 4863.678999999999
point it doesn't

4860.56 --> 4866.719
it proves to me that i'm absolutely not

4863.679 --> 4867.52
gay and have empirical evidence to back

4866.719 --> 4870.96
that

4867.52 --> 4874.639
you get it you [ __ ] wit

4870.96 --> 4877.44
so keep bringing that up you [ __ ]

4874.639 --> 4879.4400000000005
keep wishful thinking yeah

4877.44 --> 4881.199
keep wishful thinking it's not gonna

4879.44 --> 4882.08
happen

4881.199 --> 4884.159
yeah

4882.08 --> 4886.96
but why don't you come up to me and try

4884.159 --> 4889.199
and to see what happens

4886.96 --> 4892.0
why don't you come up to me

4889.199 --> 4896.239
huh try and see what happens it's gonna

4892.0 --> 4896.239
hurt i promise you it's gonna hurt

4898.32 --> 4904.799999999999
those people don't need to try well most

4900.84 --> 4909.92
people aren't surrounded by super pro

4904.8 --> 4909.92
gay people all the time as they grow up

4915.44 --> 4920.799999999999
and yeah i did feel i did feel the

4918.8 --> 4922.08
freedom

4920.8 --> 4924.96
to try it

4922.08 --> 4926.88
i thought like this i just gotta

4924.96 --> 4929.28
see if there's anything about this

4926.88 --> 4932.2390000000005
because i didn't have any natural

4929.28 --> 4934.48
longings it's not like oh god no i just

4932.239 --> 4938.08
had to fight what like what the [ __ ] is

4934.48 --> 4940.718999999999
gay i didn't even understand why

4938.08 --> 4942.96
i don't get it i get nothing about it

4940.719 --> 4947.28
it's just disgusting

4942.96 --> 4949.84
everything about it is just disgusting

4947.28 --> 4951.92
and i didn't understand how other people

4949.84 --> 4952.88
could do that

4951.92 --> 4955.92
so

4952.88 --> 4959.12
i took a test i kissed a guy i picked a

4955.92 --> 4961.36
guy that specifically looked like a man

4959.12 --> 4964.08
and not like

4961.36 --> 4966.96
almost a woman or something but like a

4964.08 --> 4969.04
guy guy that actually looked like a guy

4966.96 --> 4970.4800000000005
to test it like

4969.04 --> 4973.92
what is this

4970.48 --> 4975.599999999999
i took a test i almost threw up

4973.92 --> 4977.679
several witnesses

4975.6 --> 4979.280000000001
yeah

4977.679 --> 4982.28
never did it again

4979.28 --> 4982.28
ever

4986.88 --> 4991.92
ugh no we're not discussing gay sex ass

4997.12 --> 5001.84

5007.92 --> 5013.4400000000005

yeah don't do that adam don't

5086.88 --> 5090.32
[ __ ] do that

5096.0 --> 5099.92
the best part about gays they don't no

5097.679 --> 5102.719
that's not the best part that means that

5099.92 --> 5105.28
they torture everybody else for [ __ ]

5102.719 --> 5107.92
80 years or 60 or however long they live

5105.28 --> 5111.36
before they die of their own butt sex

5107.92 --> 5113.6
yeah it's not good at all

5111.36 --> 5116.32
them not reproducing is not helping

5113.6 --> 5120.400000000001
anybody they [ __ ] make everybody

5116.32 --> 5120.4
miserable during that entire time

5120.56 --> 5125.96
there's nothing good about it

5122.719 --> 5125.96
at all

5130.4 --> 5133.4
ugh

5167.12 --> 5169.84
that's right

5176.639 --> 5182.76
goes against nature and goes against god

5190.239 --> 5193.599999999999
yeah let's not forget that one

5192.639 --> 5196.0
i mean

5193.6 --> 5198.4800000000005
animals even do that weird [ __ ]

5196.0 --> 5201.199
sometimes i mean like even

5198.48 --> 5203.839999999999
what is uncle gary the goat oh and

5201.199 --> 5205.12
benjamin reported how uncle gary over

5203.84 --> 5209.360000000001
like

5205.12 --> 5212.5599999999995
some goat just like took uncle gary yes

5209.36 --> 5215.04
right so animals do do it i promise you

5212.56 --> 5217.52
though they're not gonna be like feeling

5215.04 --> 5219.04
very good about it afterward

5217.52 --> 5221.1990000000005
yeah

5219.04 --> 5222.08
the health detriments

5221.199 --> 5225.28
the

5222.08 --> 5227.5199999999995
negative side effects still happen

5225.28 --> 5229.44
because that's part of the design from

5227.52 --> 5232.96
god

5229.44 --> 5235.839999999999
yeah so oh animals do it yeah and they

5232.96 --> 5238.2390000000005
get the punishment too

5235.84 --> 5239.84
yeah they have that impulses they don't

5238.239 --> 5242.239
have impulse control because they have

5239.84 --> 5243.1990000000005
no conscious realization but they're

5242.239 --> 5245.44
still

5243.199 --> 5248.0
gonna pay the penalty

5245.44 --> 5251.199
they're still gonna have weirdness

5248.0 --> 5253.199
a weird energy or health detriments

5251.199 --> 5255.44
they're still gonna have that

5253.199 --> 5258.48
even if they're animals so you can say

5255.44 --> 5264.36
oh but in nature there's gay yeah and

5258.48 --> 5264.36
they pay the price too yeah yeah they do

5287.04 --> 5290.08
[ __ ] off [ __ ]

5292.32 --> 5298.32
i'm officially homophobic if you can't

5294.32 --> 5298.32
deal with that then just [ __ ] off

5299.679 --> 5302.719
yeah

5300.639 --> 5304.719
the world's not going to be turned gay

5302.719 --> 5306.96
because you're a [ __ ] demon you get

5304.719 --> 5309.84
it you piece of [ __ ]

5306.96 --> 5309.84
your predator

5314.61 --> 5317.67
[Music]

5324.42 --> 5327.85
[Music]

5335.36 --> 5340.08
yeah that is it is kind of gay when they

5337.679 --> 5340.08
do that

5341.44 --> 5348.28
but it is technically not sex

5344.32 --> 5348.28
it is kind of gay though

5369.44 --> 5375.36
yeah i know adam it's like a sport to

5371.679 --> 5375.36
them they really make effort

5376.719 --> 5383.84
they really they just line up

5380.4 --> 5383.839999999999
numpties for the slaughter

5387.6 --> 5392.4400000000005
that's hilarious

5389.12 --> 5392.44
go animals

5393.44 --> 5395.678999999999
uh

5397.36 --> 5402.799999999999
yeah probably

5400.4 --> 5405.5199999999995
right but what is this whole go to hell

5402.8 --> 5406.8
thing what does that even mean yeah this

5405.52 --> 5409.1990000000005
is such

5406.8 --> 5412.8
a catholicized

5409.199 --> 5416.0
priestly conception of this afterword

5412.8 --> 5416.0
place yeah

5416.56 --> 5419.04
no

5417.52 --> 5420.96
the hell

5419.04 --> 5423.28
is what opens up

5420.96 --> 5426.56
in your life

5423.28 --> 5429.04
when you do it

5426.56 --> 5430.159000000001
it's not about oh you go to hell after

5429.04 --> 5432.32
you die

5430.159 --> 5434.48
how the [ __ ] should you know how to [ __ ]

5432.32 --> 5437.679
should anybody know

5434.48 --> 5441.44
the hell is what you conjure forth in

5437.679 --> 5443.28
your life when you do it

5441.44 --> 5444.5599999999995
it's right there

5443.28 --> 5446.8
you do it

5444.56 --> 5448.88
there's hell

5446.8 --> 5451.6
now you're in hell

5448.88 --> 5454.08
wow alive

5451.6 --> 5455.4400000000005
and if you stick to that it's gonna get

5454.08 --> 5458.0
worse

5455.44 --> 5461.879999999999
and that happens the same for animals as

5458.0 --> 5461.88
it does for human beings

5475.92 --> 5479.84
yeah because here's the thing

5478.08 --> 5481.199
dogs

5479.84 --> 5483.12
they're like

5481.199 --> 5483.839999999999
yeah humping

5483.12 --> 5486.239
like

5483.84 --> 5488.400000000001
another man dog or something

5486.239 --> 5491.04
they're just following an impulse they

5488.4 --> 5493.36
don't really want a man hump they

5491.04 --> 5495.679
probably want to hump a female

5493.36 --> 5498.239
but it's just that the man

5495.679 --> 5499.679
dog just seems attractive in that second

5498.239 --> 5501.919999999999
and then you do it they don't think

5499.679 --> 5503.4400000000005
they're gay you see

5501.92 --> 5506.719
they're like

5503.44 --> 5509.12
it's like aberrant behavior effectively

5506.719 --> 5510.32
but they're not like oh that means i'm

5509.12 --> 5512.159
gay

5510.32 --> 5515.44
and that they're always then going to

5512.159 --> 5518.4
seek out male dogs yeah

5515.44 --> 5522.239
that's what gays do

5518.4 --> 5523.839999999999
that's what gay humans do they say i'm

5522.239 --> 5528.0
gay

5523.84 --> 5531.28
and i'm going to like seek out men

5528.0 --> 5534.88
because they have this identity

5531.28 --> 5537.759999999999
made for themselves that says i'm gay

5534.88 --> 5539.52
yeah that's the problem dogs don't have

5537.76 --> 5542.400000000001
that they don't

5539.52 --> 5544.719
care at all

5542.4 --> 5547.36
they're not going to make an identity

5544.719 --> 5548.719
for themselves out of their aberrant

5547.36 --> 5550.0
behavior

5548.719 --> 5553.04
you see

5550.0 --> 5553.04
that's the difference

5554.239 --> 5557.678999999999
dude

5579.52 --> 5583.719
not

5580.719 --> 5583.719
funny

5591.24 --> 5594.29
[Music]

5604.0 --> 5607.04
dogs do always look like they're on

5605.92 --> 5612.4400000000005
ecstasy

5607.04 --> 5612.44
well spit the young ones especially yeah

5623.04 --> 5626.04

how the hell did

5638.239 --> 5642.839999999999
this show turn into all this

5644.8 --> 5649.84
that is so weird

5647.679 --> 5651.12
definitely did not think i would be

5649.84 --> 5652.719
talking about

5651.12 --> 5654.88
gay

5652.719 --> 5656.719
second half of this show i think it's

5654.88 --> 5659.1990000000005
the trolls they just roll in there and

5656.719 --> 5660.719
then made everything about gay because

5659.199 --> 5662.239
again they're all

5660.719 --> 5664.88
stay at home

5662.239 --> 5666.959999999999
but monkey pucks

5664.88 --> 5668.8
gay sex victims

5666.96 --> 5671.199
from gay pride month

5668.8 --> 5673.76
so they're all couch bound they can't

5671.199 --> 5676.159
get into the sun because their face is

5673.76 --> 5678.159000000001
full of blisters and [ __ ]

5676.159 --> 5680.5599999999995
they're all really frustrated and they

5678.159 --> 5681.839999999999
still try to convince themselves it was

5680.56 --> 5684.84
all worth it

5681.84 --> 5684.84
huh

5703.119 --> 5708.5199999999995
no

5704.48 --> 5708.5199999999995
no that's not how that worked

5715.44 --> 5719.919999999999
it's just a lie that's not how it worked

5717.84 --> 5722.159000000001
at all that's not the order

5719.92 --> 5722.159
yeah

5722.48 --> 5726.08
you brought up gay [ __ ]

5727.04 --> 5731.6
you brought it in here you started the

5728.8 --> 5731.6
accusations

5733.119 --> 5737.36
then

5734.08 --> 5740.84
i told you what i think was going on

5737.36 --> 5745.5199999999995
why the sock trolls all of a sudden

5740.84 --> 5748.719
yeah because of the butt monkey box

5745.52 --> 5752.56
because of gay pride month

5748.719 --> 5755.56
that was not how i started it

5752.56 --> 5755.56
liar

5765.36 --> 5768.36
uh

5782.08 --> 5787.84
yeah deluge of derps definitely seeking

5784.88 --> 5790.32
star water it is that it is derpcon 5 at

5787.84 --> 5790.32
this point

5790.88 --> 5793.92
it's just war

5794.4 --> 5801.08
so [ __ ] suicide bombing chat trolls

5813.36 --> 5819.04
oh yeah ben what yeah i've seen that

5815.84 --> 5821.28
it's all over the place

5819.04 --> 5822.639
what caused it oh what do you think it

5821.28 --> 5824.88
caused it

5822.639 --> 5827.84
everybody knows what caused it nobody

5824.88 --> 5827.84
needs to hear

5828.32 --> 5837.08
justin bieber say a word to know exactly

5832.88 --> 5837.08
what happened exactly

5841.76 --> 5846.360000000001
what

5842.96 --> 5846.36
does that mean

5856.719 --> 5859.719
right

5860.13 --> 5863.279
[Music]

5904.159 --> 5909.48
oh derpcon g for gay hmm

5911.76 --> 5914.159000000001
all right

5914.88 --> 5920.0
i don't know i i think that

5916.96 --> 5922.28
kindness by standard trolls are gay

5920.0 --> 5925.92
anyway right whether they're active

5922.28 --> 5928.719
homosexuals or just gay

5925.92 --> 5930.0
it's kind of superfluous to call it

5928.719 --> 5933.76
g

5930.0 --> 5936.88
because it's kind of g per default and

5933.76 --> 5940.88
anyway right i mean trolling is kind of

5936.88 --> 5940.88
gay you have to admit that

5946.159 --> 5950.759999999999
standing down yeah it's a good idea

5947.76 --> 5950.76
enterprise

5962.639 --> 5969.92
one accord in british columbia canada

5966.56 --> 5971.76
cool george sanford

5969.92 --> 5976.08
interesting development i hope there's

5971.76 --> 5976.08
going to be more following up on that

5976.56 --> 5982.56
yeah i mean all these jav companies all

5979.84 --> 5984.88
these pharmaceutical mega corporations

5982.56 --> 5987.92
that have been part of

5984.88 --> 5991.28
all this vaccination scam they all need

5987.92 --> 5993.52
to be shut down people arrested

5991.28 --> 5995.759999999999
criminally charged

5993.52 --> 5998.159000000001
and the laboratories literally

5995.76 --> 6001.6
dismantled and chemical wastes and

5998.159 --> 6004.799999999999
biological hazardous waste destroyed

6001.6 --> 6004.8
that's what needs to happen

6004.96 --> 6009.6
sooner the better

6007.6 --> 6013.119000000001
it's their poison factories they're

6009.6 --> 6016.320000000001
literally eugenics poison factories that

6013.119 --> 6019.119
have only one singular goal and that is

6016.32 --> 6020.32
to degenerate

6019.119 --> 6021.599999999999
numb down

6020.32 --> 6022.96
and kill

6021.6 --> 6026.96
humanity

6022.96 --> 6029.96
and they need to be taken care of

6026.96 --> 6029.96
permanently

6048.239 --> 6052.239
oh goodie drilling again

6058.08 --> 6064.5199999999995
turn back jab man that's good good

6060.4 --> 6064.5199999999995
georgetown for good to hear that

6067.199 --> 6071.678999999999
yeah i think that overall there is some

6069.52 --> 6074.8
retraction worldwide they're just kind

6071.679 --> 6077.119
of bluffing like it isn't happening

6074.8 --> 6079.28
but yeah there is a

6077.119 --> 6082.4
distinct

6079.28 --> 6085.44
catching on of the world public to the

6082.4 --> 6089.199
the corona scam

6085.44 --> 6090.32
and well basically the the genocide

6089.199 --> 6093.839999999999
medical

6090.32 --> 6093.84
tyranny genocide

6094.639 --> 6098.639
and there's action and i'm very very

6096.719 --> 6100.0
curious to see because there is like

6098.639 --> 6101.6
even signs in the netherlands that

6100.0 --> 6103.679
they're actually going to do something

6101.6 --> 6106.320000000001
about it at some point

6103.679 --> 6108.2390000000005
already volunteered for being part of an

6106.32 --> 6109.599999999999
arrest team if they needed anybody

6108.239 --> 6112.239
because everybody was shedding their

6109.6 --> 6115.92
pants or something i'll do it

6112.239 --> 6115.919999999999
dude i'll do it without body armor

6116.48 --> 6119.879999999999
i don't care

6126.88 --> 6131.679
so yeah

6129.119 --> 6133.04
it's a good sign

6131.679 --> 6136.159
and the new

6133.04 --> 6140.08
medical scam with the monkey pox is just

6136.159 --> 6143.04
utterly failing like everybody is like

6140.08 --> 6143.04
highly aware

6143.36 --> 6148.799999999999
not to fall for anything

6146.639 --> 6152.0
it's like the entire medical

6148.8 --> 6154.639
establishment is now

6152.0 --> 6157.119
unveiled people know

6154.639 --> 6160.4800000000005
they just know they just know this is

6157.119 --> 6163.719
all wrong this is all driven

6160.48 --> 6163.718999999999
by eugenics

6163.92 --> 6167.4400000000005
only death comes from going along with

6166.639 --> 6169.4400000000005
it

6167.44 --> 6172.08
people know now

6169.44 --> 6173.5199999999995
now the next step has got to be

6172.08 --> 6176.32
actually

6173.52 --> 6178.96
routing them

6176.32 --> 6181.28
actually routing them

6178.96 --> 6182.88
next big thing food chart well yeah

6181.28 --> 6184.8
seeking star wars especially in the

6182.88 --> 6187.36
united states they're really

6184.8 --> 6188.84
oh they're torching all these

6187.36 --> 6191.28
food

6188.84 --> 6192.639
producing both packaging

6191.28 --> 6194.8
facilities

6192.639 --> 6196.0
yeah

6194.8 --> 6197.76
so

6196.0 --> 6200.08
that that's happening

6197.76 --> 6202.08
we're not really even noticing it that

6200.08 --> 6202.96
much in europe though

6202.08 --> 6204.88
but

6202.96 --> 6206.96
on the other hand they're trying it in

6204.88 --> 6209.36
their own way here because our

6206.96 --> 6211.92
government is currently engaging

6209.36 --> 6213.599999999999
in like a straight-on attack on farmers

6211.92 --> 6215.76
again they've been doing it for a while

6213.6 --> 6217.119000000001
but now they're like really trying to

6215.76 --> 6220.159000000001
push

6217.119 --> 6221.119
all farming out of the netherlands which

6220.159 --> 6224.719
would be

6221.119 --> 6228.0
unmitigated disaster if that happens it

6224.719 --> 6229.04
would be the end of our country

6228.0 --> 6231.44
like

6229.04 --> 6234.0
permanently the end like it will not be

6231.44 --> 6237.119
able to restore after that point it's

6234.0 --> 6239.52
probably going to lead to civil war

6237.119 --> 6241.599999999999
if they'd succeed but they're not they

6239.52 --> 6243.280000000001
don't seem to be succeeding

6241.6 --> 6246.400000000001
it's the same cabinet that did the

6243.28 --> 6247.679
corona scam everybody's highly alert

6246.4 --> 6249.04
about this

6247.679 --> 6250.4800000000005
nobody

6249.04 --> 6254.08
is with them

6250.48 --> 6259.4
except for corporate invested

6254.08 --> 6259.4
scumbags that are traders to the country

6260.4 --> 6264.638999999999
australia is fine with foods right it's

6262.96 --> 6266.96
mostly america

6264.639 --> 6268.8
they're really making effort in america

6266.96 --> 6271.52
of course they're trying everywhere but

6268.8 --> 6275.52
america is like the prime

6271.52 --> 6278.0
target for food shortaging short itching

6275.52 --> 6281.119000000001
yeah to create it

6278.0 --> 6283.04
just like the whole oil shortage as well

6281.119 --> 6286.159
like they're doing it with

6283.04 --> 6289.5199999999995
food and they're doing it with

6286.159 --> 6291.44
gas and oil in the united states and

6289.52 --> 6292.88
coal of course

6291.44 --> 6295.199
they're just trying to shut everything

6292.88 --> 6295.1990000000005
down

6298.719 --> 6303.159
all right so have some trust

6303.28 --> 6308.0
don't don't think we've just won

6305.76 --> 6311.6
everything because people are waking up

6308.0 --> 6314.32
but stay alert it is it seems to be

6311.6 --> 6316.4800000000005
gradually moving in the right direction

6314.32 --> 6318.96
it it seems to be getting

6316.48 --> 6322.638999999999
to ahead and that's a good thing

6318.96 --> 6323.92
because this nasty situation overall

6322.639 --> 6325.76
that's been like

6323.92 --> 6328.4800000000005
building up in the last 20 years it

6325.76 --> 6330.719
can't last for much longer

6328.48 --> 6333.599999999999
it's unsustainable like things are going

6330.719 --> 6334.639
to go really wrong if it's not

6333.6 --> 6337.280000000001
like

6334.639 --> 6339.36
truly stopped and a lot of people are

6337.28 --> 6342.5599999999995
aware of this

6339.36 --> 6344.96
so i do have a good feeling about it

6342.56 --> 6348.56
so don't worry too much don't squirt

6344.96 --> 6350.96
over like fear porn videos don't do it

6348.56 --> 6353.92
it doesn't help anything it doesn't help

6350.96 --> 6355.52
your morale it doesn't relieve you and

6353.92 --> 6357.6
it's not good

6355.52 --> 6359.679
for the cohesion

6357.6 --> 6361.280000000001
and purity of your

6359.679 --> 6363.28
thought well

6361.28 --> 6365.92
you need to keep those waters clean as

6363.28 --> 6368.159
much as you can the more psychological

6365.92 --> 6370.32
warfare the more the purity of the

6368.159 --> 6374.4
waters is important the waters of your

6370.32 --> 6375.679
mind in this case keep that well

6374.4 --> 6378.159
clean

6375.679 --> 6379.4400000000005
and protect it

6378.159 --> 6382.0
right

6379.44 --> 6384.239
