today because yeah so let me switch

91.86 --> 99.57
around quite a lot yeah I'm not really

95.82 --> 101.369
sad about it though it's not windy so

99.57 --> 103.19999999999999
it's not even that cold but yeah it's

101.369 --> 105.0
only became very moist and it's even

103.2 --> 111.39
raining every now and then but that's

105.0 --> 114.539
good cause plants need water so this is

111.39 --> 117.39
actually excellent weather so far you

114.539 --> 120.09
know couple of sunny days and then a

117.39 --> 125.52
little less sunny day with some rain

120.09 --> 129.44
that's nature plants trees all that

125.52 --> 129.44
thrives on that so yeah great

131.15 --> 142.95000000000002
and yeah not raining hard or anything so

135.95 --> 149.25
yeah green tea with me today and jets

142.95 --> 152.22
already nice and full so let's see was

149.25 --> 157.49
in there Marceline was first indeed

152.22 --> 164.0
yabba Cleary Amanda young good servant

157.49 --> 167.37
dinosaur Falcon flat ball James Mason

164.0 --> 171.209
they like oh hi oh yeah good to see you

167.37 --> 174.24
all this Saturday morning or afternoon

171.209 --> 182.79
or evening if you're in Australia or

174.24 --> 185.57000000000002
Asia so uh yesterday for me was quite

182.79 --> 185.57
late actually

185.75 --> 194.31
because yeah Owen Benjamin was doing a

190.4 --> 195.87
and create a very long stream I had to

194.31 --> 202.32
cut it off at the end because it just

195.87 --> 203.73000000000002
kept on going but yeah that was good

202.32 --> 205.739
although I have little trouble

203.73 --> 214.37
remembering what I was about again this

205.739 --> 218.76
is a lot of things he was also getting I

214.37 --> 222.3
don't know very metaphorical a lot it

218.76 --> 226.38
was great and yeah I was interesting I

222.3 --> 229.17000000000002
was active in chat and like I really

226.38 --> 233.22
took notice you know like he when you

229.17 --> 236.16
say something good and easy to read he

233.22 --> 238.53
actually read many of my comments but

236.16 --> 242.1
that I thought like wow really he reads

238.53 --> 246.269
my comments but then I try to not get

242.1 --> 248.37
too stimulated by that and listen a

246.269 --> 253.019
little bit more carefully and he man

248.37 --> 255.39000000000001
he's he shouted a shout out shout out he

253.019 --> 257.459
mentions so much of what I said in chat

255.39 --> 259.859
I I can barely believe he can still

257.459 --> 261.62
follow that because his chat just keeps

259.859 --> 263.47999999999996
going and going it going

261.62 --> 268.889
but you

263.48 --> 271.26
retrospect he mentions a lot of things

268.889 --> 273.66
people say so I'm not gonna get all

271.26 --> 275.84999999999997
squirty about that but it is kind of

273.66 --> 285.389
cool you know somebody that's that

275.85 --> 288.21000000000004
crushing can yeah does that and I look I

285.389 --> 290.81
really do my best like oh yeah

288.21 --> 295.919
fanatically to try and say things that

290.81 --> 298.05
to stay in life to be a proper bear but

295.919 --> 301.139
not too proper you know you got to have

298.05 --> 303.63
some fun too but it's like a real trick

301.139 --> 306.81
like how do you get silly without going

303.63 --> 308.84
too far and it's kind of it's it's kind

306.81 --> 313.71
of a fascinating challenge you do that

308.84 --> 316.56
besides a big bear like where he's I

313.71 --> 322.19
know it's I don't know I love I love

316.56 --> 326.18
hanging around his hangouts and just I

322.19 --> 330.06
don't know man his his manner is just so

326.18 --> 332.57
awesome and it's you can really feel the

330.06 --> 336.479
energy radiating off everything in there

332.57 --> 339.03
skates is why for the dog even in the

336.479 --> 341.729
goats and all of it is yeah the plants

339.03 --> 344.039
and there were even some really

341.729 --> 346.14
beautiful blossoming trees like in the

344.039 --> 354.09
back that I took notice off a little

346.14 --> 356.4
anyway but at least I got a great look

354.09 --> 358.919
out here you know in a way sort of this

356.4 --> 360.96
is my garden as well except that I don't

358.919 --> 364.32
really physically interact with it a lot

360.96 --> 367.58
I just got a good look out here so I

364.32 --> 370.8
shouldn't be complaining too much

367.58 --> 370.8
[Music]

374.61 --> 386.5
okay have it don't don't take what I

382.36 --> 390.81
said too far it's look it's just the guy

386.5 --> 394.78
is like impressive sorry but he is and

390.81 --> 397.0
you know he's not perfect but he's just

394.78 --> 400.44899999999996
so much energy and I'm just you know I

397.0 --> 404.65
am empathic there were some letters he

400.449 --> 406.449
wrote he read out that even described a

404.65 --> 410.02
lot of processes that were like so

406.449 --> 412.74
familiar to me it's like like damn that

410.02 --> 418.18
sounds incredibly familiar

412.74 --> 421.99
and so there's I'm not the only one that

418.18 --> 424.81
must feel this but I don't know if

421.99 --> 426.49
you're just all spazzed out by

424.81 --> 427.93
everything he says and you're just

426.49 --> 429.37
squirting all the time yeah you're

427.93 --> 432.69
probably not gonna sense that you're

429.37 --> 432.69
just gonna sense the squirt

438.21 --> 444.84
marceline come on I know look

448.99 --> 454.81
you know Master Salim I go on there also

451.42 --> 459.91
to make a point you know it's look the

454.81 --> 461.71
ballers are just trying to wall

459.91 --> 463.42
everything off and build their safe

461.71 --> 466.15
spaces everywhere to make everything

463.42 --> 469.03000000000003
baller only and to get like back to the

466.15 --> 471.25
old days where you could just really

469.03 --> 474.36999999999995
cure Flat Earth and not get confronted

471.25 --> 476.17
with facts you know so that's really

474.37 --> 478.3
what they're trying and even though

476.17 --> 481.54
there's just out in the open and

478.3 --> 485.44
everybody's watching Flat Earth research

481.54 --> 487.15000000000003
in academics they just don't go there

485.44 --> 488.89
anymore and then they make themselves

487.15 --> 493.33
believe that it doesn't exist

488.89 --> 495.49
so it requires somebody to sometimes

493.33 --> 497.97999999999996
bring the flame of honor bring that

495.49 --> 500.95
torch and just go into the darkness and

497.98 --> 502.99
remind them like hello I know you're all

500.95 --> 505.69
very comfortable in your safe space here

502.99 --> 507.97
but I'd like to remind you that's not

505.69 --> 510.52
real you know I'm not gonna do that like

507.97 --> 514.69
constantly but I need to remind you

510.52 --> 518.05
every now and then so that's also part

514.69 --> 521.71
of the reason I go there and I don't

518.05 --> 525.67
know you know I in from in a way I do

521.71 --> 528.82
appreciate Jose you know definitely has

525.67 --> 531.93
flaws but I do know I find I do find him

528.82 --> 537.58
somewhat of an entertaining host and

531.93 --> 540.8199999999999
yeah you know and I mean I'm impulsive

537.58 --> 544.1800000000001
at it look yeah I just I just go around

540.82 --> 546.34
and if it has open panels I may get on

544.18 --> 550.87
to it if I feel that I can do something

546.34 --> 552.7
useful you know so even though Jose yeah

550.87 --> 557.65
is now engaging in this new policy

552.7 --> 561.34
through his membership system paid to

557.65 --> 563.4399999999999
kick system yeah I will still try to get

561.34 --> 566.98
on there but I do realize now that yeah

563.44 --> 568.96
if I if I push it you know if I shine

566.98 --> 571.8100000000001
that torch too close to their eyes and

568.96 --> 574.6600000000001
it starts burning them that somebody is

571.81 --> 576.4599999999999
probably gonna kick me quick especially

574.66 --> 579.85
Shaun Hawkins he's like really on the

576.46 --> 582.23
button you know like he's gotten this

579.85 --> 589.91
new this is there's no paid boomer

582.23 --> 593.14
and he's like yeah this is he's he's

589.91 --> 595.63
found a little throne to rule from

593.14 --> 602.24
finally got his some of his power back

595.63 --> 609.77
everything he sacrificed so that can't

602.24 --> 612.26
be stopped for a while but yeah I know

609.77 --> 615.05
it is what it is but I still thought

612.26 --> 622.9399999999999
that I was able to make a good

615.05 --> 627.5
impression yesterday he's added

622.94 --> 634.61
okay mother Salim who exactly I talking

627.5 --> 641.27
about Jose oh yeah he habit that's Jose

634.61 --> 643.64
JG he he used to also go in on the Flat

641.27 --> 647.99
Earth debates and he actually started

643.64 --> 649.61
out as a flat earther sort of but yeah

647.99 --> 651.83
he had trouble with arguments as well

649.61 --> 654.32
but he he was like one of the guys and

651.83 --> 658.5500000000001
he did kind of like grant he did still

654.32 --> 661.73
does sometimes he has a p900 I think or

658.55 --> 665.15
similar camera wasn't yeah anyway and he

661.73 --> 668.6
does two photographs of the beach and

665.15 --> 673.67
and yeah get some pretty good shots of

668.6 --> 675.6800000000001
the horizon and he has yeah he's since

673.67 --> 680.39
built up his own channel and he kind of

675.68 --> 682.8499999999999
like has this brawler room where ballers

680.39 --> 684.59
can just talk about whatever they want

682.85 --> 686.26
but flat earthers are also allowed in

684.59 --> 691.5500000000001
there and then when it happens

686.26 --> 695.99
Jose kind of sets up like a brawl almost

691.55 --> 697.9399999999999
like a yeah sort of a boxing match then

695.99 --> 700.51
he put a nice alert sets to people like

697.94 --> 703.5200000000001
okay you two go and debate and yeah

700.51 --> 705.38
people oblige and there's plenty of flat

703.52 --> 708.23
earthers that also to come back there

705.38 --> 711.95
then our that are on certain levels and

708.23 --> 713.36
I don't know I sometimes I'm not always

711.95 --> 714.2090000000001
in the mood for that but sometimes I

713.36 --> 717.899
actually find it

714.209 --> 719.79
interesting not because it's like oh my

717.899 --> 721.559
god there's so many discoveries here but

719.79 --> 727.17
just to see the interaction

721.559 --> 731.3389999999999
I know but yeah Jose did on my show even

727.17 --> 733.5889999999999
officially it's it's some time ago but

731.339 --> 735.749
he kind of like came out as a baller at

733.589 --> 741.5400000000001
some point that like yeah I was just

735.749 --> 743.4590000000001
acting and and he just he just believes

741.54 --> 746.699
it's a ball he doesn't have a lot of

743.459 --> 749.91
argumentation forward really and he's

746.699 --> 758.699
admitted that but he just yeah that's

749.91 --> 759.569
just the way he thinks so hello stallion

758.699 --> 762.8
8012

759.569 --> 762.8
yeah I'm doing fine I'm doing great

763.16 --> 770.61
finally got myself to make a spaghetti

766.999 --> 772.8290000000001
just like every time I plan to do that

770.61 --> 774.9590000000001
it's like I let it sit for a while

772.829 --> 778.319
because it's a lot of work to do and and

774.959 --> 782.429
I don't know why I tend to give it some

778.319 --> 786.9799999999999
time before I initiate but I've had that

782.429 --> 786.98
yesterday ends great great meal

799.54 --> 811.389
he flipped for money be honest well

804.06 --> 816.9399999999999
maybe you have a point Guns of Navarone

811.389 --> 821.199
ARNP yeah he also mentioned that as

816.94 --> 824.3800000000001
reasons but that's because I think he's

821.199 --> 827.4399999999999
just decided to prioritize being a show

824.38 --> 832.72
host over being really part of the

827.44 --> 838.69
debate itself because he says he just

832.72 --> 841.63
he's not really that good at it but he

838.69 --> 845.889
is good at socializing and you know that

841.63 --> 848.9399999999999
so oh good he's yeah he's pretty good at

845.889 --> 853.74
it when he's like in a in a stable

848.94 --> 853.74
position with it so

863.92 --> 867.8789999999999
and you can finally watch my show

865.959 --> 869.949
without any interruptions haha thank you

867.879 --> 880.269
for the $5 super chat the nation Amanda

869.949 --> 884.3789999999999
young yeah yeah I don't know what it is

880.269 --> 886.899
I do get interrupted a lot sometimes you

884.379 --> 888.5790000000001
know sometimes it's almost like even on

886.899 --> 891.85
the debates it it comes and goes

888.579 --> 893.829
it's weird how the worse sometimes I get

891.85 --> 897.0400000000001
on there and it's like everybody just

893.829 --> 899.4989999999999
immediately silences as as soon as I

897.04 --> 901.059
speak up it's like they make room and

899.499 --> 904.48
then I can do my thing and it's like oh

901.059 --> 905.769
wow and then another day I get down

904.48 --> 907.989
there and every time I try to say

905.769 --> 911.649
something like immediately somebody else

907.989 --> 914.799
speaks it's like somehow the timing just

911.649 --> 916.709
everytime and feels almost like no are

914.799 --> 921.85
wind you're not allowed to talk today

916.709 --> 925.5999999999999
like what why this is why can't I talk

921.85 --> 927.249
today no apparent reason when I would

925.6 --> 931.239
literally say people would be like what

927.249 --> 937.389
no that's not really true it's weird how

931.239 --> 940.299
that just works out sometimes whoa okay

937.389 --> 942.429
Wow thank you Guns of Navarone RFP for

it wasn't English but there were a lot

1031.789 --> 1038.87
of Dutch people in chat it was funny

1033.829 --> 1041.6
because I think there were also Dutch

1038.87 --> 1043.9389999999999
ballers in there I've there seemed to be

1041.6 --> 1044.809
more Dutch ballers now suddenly popping

1043.939 --> 1050.539
on the scene

1044.809 --> 1053.21
maybe it's the corona but they were like

1050.539 --> 1057.37
asking me typical questions ballers

1053.21 --> 1061.76
would do in that chat but in Dutch and

1057.37 --> 1063.9189999999999
so then I like responded exactly like I

1061.76 --> 1066.23
normally do but I did it all in Dutch

1063.919 --> 1069.47
and it was like really puzzling

1066.23 --> 1073.22
sometimes to get the words right because

1069.47 --> 1076.13
in a way I kind of I'm creative with

1073.22 --> 1079.46
English like I try to be very sensibly

1076.13 --> 1081.0490000000002
creative so then it works but yeah when

1079.46 --> 1084.5
you then have to translate it's like oh

1081.049 --> 1086.33
how do you actually do that in Dutch but

1084.5 --> 1088.82
it worked out pretty well and was like

1086.33 --> 1091.1
surprised like how automated sometimes

1088.82 --> 1093.6789999999999
it just came out it's like this is it

1091.1 --> 1095.33
it's like well yeah yeah that is

1093.679 --> 1097.49
actually how you would say it in Dutch

1095.33 --> 1100.85
it's like it would just manifest like

1097.49 --> 1102.44
it's interesting it's like I never knew

1100.85 --> 1107.0
I had it in me to do it like that in

1102.44 --> 1109.97
Dutch as well woo Wow another super jet

1107.0 --> 1112.909
donation from Guns of Navarone II rmp

1109.97 --> 1115.669
another fifty dollar Canadian dollar

1112.909 --> 1119.1200000000001
damn though I was a pints that's a big

1115.669 --> 1121.6000000000001
pints buddy but thank you again very

1119.12 --> 1121.6
generous

1122.49 --> 1130.57
hmm but yeah I went on that for a while

1128.1 --> 1137.02
because I do this all the time okay it's

1130.57 --> 1138.46
literally it's good yeah it makes me

1137.02 --> 1142.84
feel a little bit weird sometimes

1138.46 --> 1145.75
because if you don't take all the energy

1142.84 --> 1148.4199999999998
in the intention and the positivity that

1145.75 --> 1151.42
I the creativity that I really try to

1148.42 --> 1153.7
insert in what I do it does sometimes

1151.42 --> 1157.24
seem like I am almost like a baller

1153.7 --> 1163.39
troll except that I also do perform live

1157.24 --> 1167.11
and all that but because I'm just so in

1163.39 --> 1168.8500000000001
chats I'm so active they're just like

1167.11 --> 1170.86
the some of these trolls that hang

1168.85 --> 1173.8
around all day long except they are just

1170.86 --> 1177.25
inserting just the same same bland crap

1173.8 --> 1179.6499999999999
and a nuisance and but it is kind of

1177.25 --> 1183.52
weird to realize like damn I spent so

1179.65 --> 1188.74
much time on the internet doing that but

1183.52 --> 1192.43
it does seem to have value I think and I

1188.74 --> 1195.43
do get appreciation for doing it and I

1192.43 --> 1199.03
do also continue to develop things as I

1195.43 --> 1201.7
do it it's like just you know chat can

1199.03 --> 1203.62
be just chat you know it can be just

1201.7 --> 1205.9
blah blah blah blah you just throw in

1203.62 --> 1207.9399999999998
whatever you don't really care or you

1205.9 --> 1212.19
you want to express something or you

1207.94 --> 1216.42
want to push something but just like

1212.19 --> 1219.79
communication verbally face-to-face you

1216.42 --> 1223.24
can really put a lot of effort and

1219.79 --> 1226.44
energy and skill into it if you realize

1223.24 --> 1230.11
that that is a thing and that it does

1226.44 --> 1234.28
build something it's not all wasted

1230.11 --> 1236.8899999999999
although yeah you have to pick the right

1234.28 --> 1238.6299999999999
places where people can actually see

1236.89 --> 1243.01
what you're doing and not just be

1238.63 --> 1245.0800000000002
offended by it for some reason but it is

1243.01 --> 1247.87
interesting how it works and everybody

1245.08 --> 1250.21
well that I know in chat that's here

1247.87 --> 1253.06
regular visitors but also in other

1250.21 --> 1253.8700000000001
places they do kind of do that by

1253.06 --> 1256.8999999999999
themselves

1253.87 --> 1260.11
to certain agree it's like they just

1256.9 --> 1261.73
decide this is how I'm like this is what

1260.11 --> 1266.11
my principles this is what I'm gonna

1261.73 --> 1268.9
forward and yeah some of them get

1266.11 --> 1270.9399999999998
creative to certain levels and some

1268.9 --> 1278.19
really develop it it's interesting to

1270.94 --> 1282.0900000000001
see really over time but I do it a lot

1278.19 --> 1285.429
sometimes I think oh man I really should

1282.09 --> 1288.73
develop my face-to-face social life a

1285.429 --> 1291.22
little bit more but it's tough it's

1288.73 --> 1294.46
tough to find a good angle to start it

1291.22 --> 1298.169
although I've had some I'd more ideas

1294.46 --> 1302.82
have been popping up like how I could

1298.169 --> 1306.3400000000001
like for example just going out for me

1302.82 --> 1309.01
going out solo is never a good idea it

1306.34 --> 1312.309
never has been because I when I do that

1309.01 --> 1316.33
I I feel lost it's really weird because

1312.309 --> 1319.44
I tested this out and Kara CLE even back

1316.33 --> 1323.799
in the day when I had more money right

1319.44 --> 1326.679
for my inheritance so I would literally

1323.799 --> 1331.5
test this like going out just by myself

1326.679 --> 1334.3600000000001
because I'd be like okay you must go out

1331.5 --> 1336.159
you know you don't want to are wind you

1334.36 --> 1337.809
don't really want to do that by yourself

1336.159 --> 1340.2700000000002
but you're gonna do it and you're gonna

1337.809 --> 1343.9289999999999
make the best of it then I would do that

1340.27 --> 1346.12
and yeah it would be halfway interesting

1343.929 --> 1349.8400000000001
but I'd still have a lot of moments

1346.12 --> 1352.4499999999998
where I'd feel kind of lonely and I feel

1349.84 --> 1360.1899999999998
also the need to separate myself from

1352.45 --> 1364.72
the crowd and just be by myself and when

1360.19 --> 1366.76
I did go out with buddies then certainly

1364.72 --> 1369.46
the whole dynamic of that just

1366.76 --> 1372.039
completely changes it's like I have

1369.46 --> 1374.409
almost a social responsibility because

1372.039 --> 1377.83
of the person I'm with and I actually

1374.409 --> 1379.63
kind of thrive on that it gives me more

1377.83 --> 1384.039
purpose in the experience it's

1379.63 --> 1387.5300000000002
interesting so yeah for me going out by

1384.039 --> 1389.39
myself is not as much fun for me as

1387.53 --> 1391.67
going out with people but it has to be

1389.39 --> 1394.01
the right people and it's kind of

1391.67 --> 1397.52
critical that they get me because if

1394.01 --> 1400.37
they don't then I might be entangled

1397.52 --> 1403.79
responsible in a way with for people

1400.37 --> 1405.53
that do unpredictable things that kind

1403.79 --> 1407.93
of harm me and they don't even realize

1405.53 --> 1412.16
it because they don't get me so it's

1407.93 --> 1414.8200000000002
yeah now surprise surprise Arwen has to

1412.16 --> 1414.8200000000002
make things complicated

1423.33 --> 1426.33
hmm

1427.56 --> 1432.95
but yeah that's just I guess this part

1430.11 --> 1432.9499999999998
of knowing myself

1441.17 --> 1447.6200000000001
yeah and added it it's almost like a

1443.54 --> 1450.29
weird dichotomy that I am at one point

1447.62 --> 1453.56
I'm I'm a really a solo person that's

1450.29 --> 1455.99
really that has thriving things on my

1453.56 --> 1458.69
own when I'm isolated but at the same

1455.99 --> 1461.84
time I'm also just as much a social

1458.69 --> 1464.0
being that wants to do exactly the

1461.84 --> 1468.1999999999998
opposite but then as I do that

1464.0 --> 1471.65
constantly risk disturbing what I've

1468.2 --> 1474.0800000000002
built being on my own see so it's like

1471.65 --> 1478.5800000000002
two different opposites it's the oh and

1474.08 --> 1482.54
a 110 the exact opposite it's all and

1478.58 --> 1485.87
it's nothing and you can depending on

1482.54 --> 1488.5
the angle of the view and it turn it

1485.87 --> 1492.1699999999998
around you know in all kinds of ways so

1488.5 --> 1494.59
that's seems to be just part of what

1492.17 --> 1494.5900000000001
I've become

1496.85 --> 1503.899
and it's always a balancing act because

1499.909 --> 1507.169
they go to one direction too much then

1503.899 --> 1509.4799999999998
the other starts to hurt or starts to

1507.169 --> 1511.3990000000001
get disruptive or starts to distort and

1509.48 --> 1516.3700000000001
if I go in the other direction then it

1511.399 --> 1516.37
happens exactly in the opposite way I

1519.1 --> 1524.0
don't know maybe a lot of people have

1521.48 --> 1526.549
this but they have just things on a

1524.0 --> 1532.21
certain auto balance with me it's not so

1526.549 --> 1535.779
automatic because I don't know

1532.21 --> 1541.73
I'm also used to be able to basically

1535.779 --> 1544.49
transition in my approach it in the way

1541.73 --> 1549.5
I I manifest my consciousness almost

1544.49 --> 1552.6490000000001
very quickly and can control it but you

1549.5 --> 1556.539
can only do that very short moments it's

1552.649 --> 1556.539
even part of acting it's

1558.759 --> 1570.129
I guess you could call it like very

1561.209 --> 1574.169
serious life method acting yeah it's

1570.129 --> 1574.1689999999999
funny how those words then fit together

1575.519 --> 1581.619
anyway what are you guys talking about

1579.07 --> 1596.379
before I end up just talking about me

1581.619 --> 1601.119
the entire session here okay see

1596.379 --> 1603.6589999999999
everybody's still drowning in the corona

1601.119 --> 1603.6589999999999
madness

1610.17 --> 1615.75
yeah my my own country seems to be

1613.01 --> 1618.57
getting some push from the politics as

1615.75 --> 1621.75
well I've taken notice of certain type

1618.57 --> 1623.82
of articles that there's this date

1621.75 --> 1626.429
coming when there's planning to do

1623.82 --> 1637.37
something really stupid and people are

1626.429 --> 1640.679
already like sick of it and also yeah I

1637.37 --> 1642.6
don't see many people with masks out

1640.679 --> 1648.21
there there are out there but they're

1642.6 --> 1650.52
really sparingly you know and also I've

1648.21 --> 1652.919
noticed that not a lot of people yeah

1650.52 --> 1654.87
people that I've known and kind of hang

1652.919 --> 1658.5900000000001
around they haven't been removed or

1654.87 --> 1661.1689999999999
anything like take it away or something

1658.59 --> 1668.6689999999999
creepy like that or whatever bought from

1661.169 --> 1671.94
going outside on the street so yeah I

1668.669 --> 1674.1000000000001
wonder what's what's gonna unfold and if

1671.94 --> 1676.8300000000002
indeed it will come to a quarantine the

1674.1 --> 1679.35
government situation and if it does I

1676.83 --> 1683.1899999999998
think I'll probably become an activist

1679.35 --> 1688.23
myself you know it's actually good

1683.19 --> 1693.71
reason to socialize and I do have this

1688.23 --> 1698.27
like urging burning need to like yeah

1693.71 --> 1701.8400000000001
let them know that I'm also sick of it

1698.27 --> 1706.53
you know I'm very very tolerant but

1701.84 --> 1708.3899999999999
doesn't mean that I that I yeah that

1706.53 --> 1709.34
it's that I gonna pretend like nothing

1708.39 --> 1713.19
is going on

1709.34 --> 1716.85
eventually I too will have to just go

1713.19 --> 1717.179
out like everybody else and just make it

1716.85 --> 1723.299
stop

1717.179 --> 1726.48
make the nonsense stop you know I want

1723.299 --> 1728.4
the restaurants to open and and it's

1726.48 --> 1732.15
kind of weird because I don't even

1728.4 --> 1734.19
difficult go to restaurants I really

1732.15 --> 1737.52
don't because it's kind of expensive for

1734.19 --> 1740.46
me and I eat all organic and it's just

1737.52 --> 1742.4
so much more convenient and healthy for

1740.46 --> 1746.299
me to do it all myself

1742.4 --> 1748.429
but I just don't like that it's all it

1746.299 --> 1749.87
doesn't make any sense to me like there

1748.429 --> 1752.24
are so many people out there that just

1749.87 --> 1754.4899999999998
their businesses are kind of being

1752.24 --> 1758.48
ruined and all these people are suddenly

1754.49 --> 1761.779
just forced to get shitty jobs that that

1758.48 --> 1764.0
don't fit them you know and where they

1761.779 --> 1772.25
can't apply their skills it's it's not

1764.0 --> 1774.38
good and the sport halls indeed and here

1772.25 --> 1779.659
I'm not a sport guy either you know but

1774.38 --> 1781.64
come on guys like what the hell doesn't

1779.659 --> 1784.429
make any sense like it's part of health

1781.64 --> 1786.5
like people need that sport they do that

1784.429 --> 1788.929
for their health they do it to get their

1786.5 --> 1794.24
stress out they need to be able to do

1788.929 --> 1797.72
that come on it's ridiculous yeah it's

1794.24 --> 1799.82
nonsensical and it's that economically

1797.72 --> 1803.89
damaging and it is demoralizing so it

1799.82 --> 1803.8899999999999
just the nonsense just needs to stop

1807.65 --> 1813.75
so I don't mind talking about the the

1810.72 --> 1815.94
subject like this no societal

1813.75 --> 1821.24
consequences because like the dispersion

1815.94 --> 1824.49
panic and the boyars I I'm so sick of

1821.24 --> 1831.66
the virus I just don't want to talk

1824.49 --> 1834.27
about it anymore and yeah and that is in

1831.66 --> 1834.9
a metaphorical sense because I'm not

1834.27 --> 1845.34
sick

1834.9 --> 1851.46
the virus can do a new cue

1845.34 --> 1854.79
I don't really know cue I you know I've

1851.46 --> 1858.15
never followed cue ever but I've heard

1854.79 --> 1860.1299999999999
him through via via and there are

1858.15 --> 1862.77
certain interesting individuals out

1860.13 --> 1865.17
there that I have suspicions may have

1862.77 --> 1868.71
involvement with it but I think you is a

1865.17 --> 1871.25
project I don't even think you as a

1868.71 --> 1871.25
person

1875.71 --> 1884.92
I know what I know Qi as I said I you

1882.1 --> 1887.49
know Q's been been around but it's a

1884.92 --> 1887.49
project

1901.5 --> 1906.24
he says stay in place and do what the

1904.47 --> 1908.52
government says and the plan will do

1906.24 --> 1912.6
great it will go great yeah great for

1908.52 --> 1916.47
who for the banks that are gonna bail

1912.6 --> 1919.77
out everyone is that good like that

1916.47 --> 1922.44
could kind of fix it right supposedly

1919.77 --> 1928.37
but yeah what then then certainly people

1922.44 --> 1933.72
in that is that good I look this plan

1928.37 --> 1936.4499999999998
look see it like this this supposed plan

1933.72 --> 1938.88
right well if it is literally just

1936.45 --> 1941.429
saying stand by and just let it all

1938.88 --> 1945.21
happen well that's gonna be one hell of

1941.429 --> 1948.8700000000001
a convoluted freaky plan and there's a

1945.21 --> 1952.74
consequence like even if we should be

1948.87 --> 1955.6689999999999
able to trust the plan then standing by

1952.74 --> 1958.95
and letting craziness transpire without

1955.669 --> 1961.289
being heard without trying to at least

1958.95 --> 1964.02
push against it that's gonna have

1961.289 --> 1966.78
spiritual consequences you know whether

1964.02 --> 1969.72
you know or trust that it'll be all

1966.78 --> 1972.27
right not acting in the face of

1969.72 --> 1977.539
something also has consequences so think

1972.27 --> 1980.789
about that you know does it matter that

1977.539 --> 1987.84
we could trust that things will work out

1980.789 --> 1989.8799999999999
alright you know if you take it from a

1987.84 --> 1994.1299999999999
perspective where it would mean don't

1989.88 --> 1997.0490000000002
panic don't go overkill

1994.13 --> 1998.8500000000001
then it's sensible advice but if you

1997.049 --> 2000.23
take it too far and say like do

1998.85 --> 2005.99
absolutely nothing

2000.23 --> 2007.99
well then even if it even if it would

2005.99 --> 2011.659
technically be true it still would have

2007.99 --> 2014.26
consequences on on your spirit for

2011.659 --> 2018.0200000000002
having that stance do you want those

2014.26 --> 2020.179
consequences really or do you what don't

2018.02 --> 2020.7
just want to do what's right in the

2020.179 --> 2023.98
moment

2020.7 --> 2027.559
[Music]

2023.98 --> 2028.309
controlled opposition oh dear how does

2027.559 --> 2033.74
that work

2028.309 --> 2040.6689999999999
I don't know control opposition to what

2033.74 --> 2043.58
Marceline do you even know what right

2040.669 --> 2046.8500000000001
well military psychological operation no

2043.58 --> 2049.399
doubt he also has some involvement

2046.85 --> 2051.879
probably but as I said I think it's a

2049.399 --> 2051.879
fragile

2079.52 --> 2087.629
nothing to benefit from all these tax

2081.809 --> 2089.8190000000004
cuts they will go that girl right

2087.629 --> 2093.299
Marco backs well that's always how it

2089.819 --> 2096.359
works the whole tax system is built for

2093.299 --> 2098.7
the mega corporations especially where

2096.359 --> 2104.39
it's really complicated because why

2098.7 --> 2104.39
would tax systems have to be complicated

2104.569 --> 2111.119
that only makes it a lot easier for big

2108.089 --> 2113.5789999999997
companies that can hire people to deal

2111.119 --> 2116.339
with those complications while the the

2113.579 --> 2119.849
smaller guy they don't have the money

2116.339 --> 2123.0
for that or they don't even realize that

2119.849 --> 2126.119
it's there and so they will go the hard

2123.0 --> 2130.46
route and basically get choked by all

2126.119 --> 2132.9900000000002
the taxes see it's it's kind of

2130.46 --> 2136.4
asymmetrical bureaucratic system in my

2132.99 --> 2136.3999999999996
opinion I've never liked it

2140.75 --> 2155.3
I don't even like the concept of tax

2149.39 --> 2157.31
deductibles not really like unless it is

2155.3 --> 2159.92
like urgent in a moment and that it is

2157.31 --> 2163.7
technically like a stimulus but and even

2159.92 --> 2166.13
that it should be kind of looked down

2163.7 --> 2167.66
upon as a solution or something that

2166.13 --> 2169.819
government could do you know like if

2167.66 --> 2172.819
everybody would push that with a vote

2169.819 --> 2176.569
like yes this specific thing must be

2172.819 --> 2178.96
stimulated but yeah then you're talking

2176.569 --> 2181.55
about a system where there's like a

2178.96 --> 2185.75
reliable way to internet vote with your

2181.55 --> 2187.6090000000004
citizens yet well that's I know that

2185.75 --> 2192.71
that used to be there I think I think

2187.609 --> 2195.619
they used to handle that like that in in

2192.71 --> 2197.96
Iceland for a while with the pirate

2195.619 --> 2200.2400000000002
party back then into the end the day I

2197.96 --> 2201.89
don't know if it hasn't been Monday lied

2200.24 --> 2203.93
out of reality or something that that

2201.89 --> 2204.589
happened I don't know I was there when

2203.93 --> 2207.319
it happened

2204.589 --> 2210.5299999999997
I thought it was great I don't know how

2207.319 --> 2214.45
it's like now but yeah Internet

2210.53 --> 2218.1090000000004
democracy could be very integral

2214.45 --> 2222.3489999999997
solution for a smaller government

2218.109 --> 2225.619
libertarian type system not perfect not

2222.349 --> 2230.75
like an ideologically libertarian system

2225.619 --> 2235.099
but more designed with that concept in

2230.75 --> 2237.319
mind and an internet democracy becomes

2235.099 --> 2243.319
more sensible like the people make the

2237.319 --> 2246.829
decisions on on the taxes anyway I'm not

2243.319 --> 2248.9
gonna it's been a while one of me even

2246.829 --> 2252.5600000000004
thinking about it but I was interred

2248.9 --> 2254.75
like this type of idea a lot talked with

2252.56 --> 2257.65
a lot of pi/2 pirate people I hung

2254.75 --> 2257.65
around in there chats

2257.66 --> 2262.549
you know I guess it's in the interest

2259.22 --> 2265.49
also gained mastering I don't know just

2262.549 --> 2274.91
understanding how the world can work how

2265.49 --> 2278.6299999999997
things can be solved but yeah just I

2274.91 --> 2281.1499999999996
don't know just this constant paperwork

2278.63 --> 2283.9700000000003
taxes and deductibles and cysts yeah

2281.15 --> 2285.89
that really just advantages the bigger

2283.97 --> 2290.299
corporations or the ones that are

2285.89 --> 2293.589
shameless enough to to find crazy ways

2290.299 --> 2299.329
around all the all the loops you know

2293.589 --> 2301.19
that's just why you know if you can get

2299.329 --> 2305.42
around it then then it's kind of

2301.19 --> 2307.819
technically broken already it's like

2305.42 --> 2310.73
it's like what if you're a wizard enough

2307.819 --> 2312.17
you no longer need to pay taxes and

2310.73 --> 2315.98
nobody can do anything about it

2312.17 --> 2317.75
like what really is that sensible to

2315.98 --> 2319.67
anyone really when you think about it

2317.75 --> 2323.15
well it's sensible to the ones that can

2319.67 --> 2326.569
do it can tell you that but it is it

2323.15 --> 2330.859
really does it really fall in line with

2326.569 --> 2335.2599999999998
what taxes fundamentally really are

2330.859 --> 2335.2599999999998
supposed to be doing you know

2339.989 --> 2351.4
what do you think real pirates know the

2348.43 --> 2356.279
earth is flat since they spend a lot of

2351.4 --> 2362.14
time out in the sea which real pirates

2356.279 --> 2367.029
you mean like Somalian pirates or

2362.14 --> 2370.5989999999997
something I don't know they might you

2367.029 --> 2373.119
know if they that region and they are

2370.599 --> 2375.7290000000003
like they do have Muslims I think or

2373.119 --> 2378.9100000000003
something so they probably if they ever

2375.729 --> 2380.799
heard it in if they were taught like

2378.91 --> 2382.779
that by their parents at some point yeah

2380.799 --> 2384.849
they may think about it but you know

2382.779 --> 2389.229
will they really care about it

2384.849 --> 2392.289
I don't think so they're probably too

2389.229 --> 2396.1499999999996
burdened with other issues to to care

2392.289 --> 2396.15
about that in the slightest

2406.25 --> 2410.9
all that about taxes has been automated

2408.95 --> 2413.3599999999997
you know you only react if there is

2410.9 --> 2419.81
something that need to be changed on tax

2413.36 --> 2426.4900000000002
form huh that's interesting I didn't

2419.81 --> 2426.49
know that huh

2427.71 --> 2435.45
Wow okay but just so you know you have

2430.8 --> 2441.1400000000003
it like I I'm not very good at finances

2435.45 --> 2441.14
in general like it makes me like wobbly

2442.13 --> 2447.9300000000003
but I do kind of try to understand the

2445.98 --> 2450.089
structures of what's going on and how it

2447.93 --> 2452.7599999999998
works and just what you see happening

2450.089 --> 2455.67
around you but that's interesting to

2452.76 --> 2458.9100000000003
know that so much is automated does it

2455.67 --> 2463.6800000000003
work out does it not like bring a lot of

2458.91 --> 2477.2999999999997
problems also or I don't know it's the

2463.68 --> 2479.839
first time I'm hearing about it so okay

2477.3 --> 2479.8390000000004
interesting

2481.08 --> 2490.71
well hey if it's working good it's at

2484.74 --> 2494.0099999999998
least worth studying you know and that's

2490.71 --> 2497.31
also the great thing about diversity of

2494.01 --> 2500.13
Nations because everybody can try out

2497.31 --> 2502.47
things and then everybody can learn of

2500.13 --> 2504.98
those things you know it's critic can

2502.47 --> 2510.48
you imagine that everything would all be

2504.98 --> 2513.33
one freaking uniform system it'll be the

2510.48 --> 2515.58
death of everything very quickly it's

2513.33 --> 2518.8199999999997
like that's just and everybody knows

2515.58 --> 2521.16
that you know you don't even there's

2518.82 --> 2523.71
just a spirit of uniformity it just

2521.16 --> 2527.0699999999997
drags on you very quickly you don't even

2523.71 --> 2535.68
have to encompass the entire world with

2527.07 --> 2539.6400000000003
that system to feel that as our Saleem I

2535.68 --> 2542.73
don't know they say so but you know

2539.64 --> 2545.79
there is virtual text and then there's

2542.73 --> 2548.54
effective text and I think that with

2545.79 --> 2551.97
system when there's a lot of socialism

2548.54 --> 2554.2799999999997
feed feeding going on that there's high

2551.97 --> 2556.2799999999997
taxes but there's also money going back

2554.28 --> 2558.8100000000004
so you don't it becomes kind of

2556.28 --> 2563.01
confusing as to what's really happening

2558.81 --> 2564.9
there to me so I don't even know if they

2563.01 --> 2569.96
effectively have the highest tax rate

2564.9 --> 2569.96
supposedly I don't know

2574.47 --> 2581.6699999999996
you know I'm not the one to ask about

2577.55 --> 2583.8
the financial conditions and dealings of

2581.67 --> 2587.31
how systems work in the world it's like

2583.8 --> 2589.59
I'm I don't know maybe should ask Max

2587.31 --> 2592.83
Keiser or something he's he'll be more

2589.59 --> 2607.23
inclined to understand all of that I'm

2592.83 --> 2610.41
not the guy I've heard of Max Keiser

2607.23 --> 2616.46
he's been around for a long time so

2610.41 --> 2620.3399999999997
oddball but like a financial guy I think

2616.46 --> 2622.89
he may have actually been the inventor

2620.34 --> 2625.17
of high-frequency trading I'm not a

2622.89 --> 2630.2999999999997
hundred percent sure but I think that he

2625.17 --> 2633.7200000000003
was remember that he at least said that

2630.3 --> 2639.03
and also backed up some historical

2633.72 --> 2642.27
things about that are we necessarily

2639.03 --> 2644.55
turned into a girl as well as we're all

2642.27 --> 2647.609
throwing random questions in him well

2644.55 --> 2649.8590000000004
haven't I always kind of stood for that

2647.609 --> 2654.5699999999997
like yes you can ask me pretty much

2649.859 --> 2657.589
everything because there I can always

2654.57 --> 2657.589
answer with something

2662.19 --> 2670.559
is that what a guru does I don't know

2666.72 --> 2674.9399999999996
what what does a Goro do you need a

2670.559 --> 2681.119
beard Griggs no I'm an elf this doesn't

2674.94 --> 2689.91
work I don't know I don't like the idea

2681.119 --> 2692.329
of guru and I call me a seer that's more

2689.91 --> 2692.3289999999997
elven

2694.29 --> 2698.07
[Music]

2700.82 --> 2705.44
[Music]

2702.16 --> 2709.8199999999997
right yeah you know and guru has been

2705.44 --> 2713.42
grafted into so many things as a word

2709.82 --> 2718.76
into the Western world into the hippie

2713.42 --> 2720.31
scene and it's just you know there's a

2718.76 --> 2725.63
lot of people just calling themselves

2720.31 --> 2730.13
guru of something and like what does

2725.63 --> 2733.63
that even mean you know it's it's like

2730.13 --> 2737.03
almost like a guru has become what a

2733.63 --> 2739.79
scientist is from the spiritual it's

2737.03 --> 2742.55
like oh somebody that do does things

2739.79 --> 2745.0099999999998
with spiritual involvement then you're a

2742.55 --> 2746.69
guru like come on

2745.01 --> 2757.69
isn't that like extremely over

2746.69 --> 2762.849
generalized you know that's hilarious

2757.69 --> 2762.849
come take a Eric Hamel

2773.05 --> 2778.5800000000004
right I'll give you in sick look yeah

2775.88 --> 2779.9
well people have been conditioned to

2778.58 --> 2782.18
live in a world where they are

2779.9 --> 2783.9500000000003
constantly conned and then yeah

2782.18 --> 2786.77
especially if they wake up that doesn't

2783.95 --> 2787.97
mean that they just that they'll just

2786.77 --> 2791.78
get over it

2787.97 --> 2793.7
you know so it becomes a habit it

2791.78 --> 2797.9
becomes an addiction to get conned it's

2793.7 --> 2802.64
it's called Stockholm Syndrome in a way

2797.9 --> 2807.05
and it yeah it's been part of humanity

2802.64 --> 2808.64
in social relationship especially in the

2807.05 --> 2813.8900000000003
more vulnerable type of social

2808.64 --> 2817.8199999999997
relationship known as yeah

2813.89 --> 2821.99
love relationships that that element has

2817.82 --> 2824.7200000000003
been present a lot like even way before

2821.99 --> 2827.29
the internet it's like you everybody

2824.72 --> 2830.45
knew somebody there that had like oh

2827.29 --> 2832.2799999999997
yeah this this woman just had this man

2830.45 --> 2835.0299999999997
and being abused and she's just not

2832.28 --> 2839.3
getting away because just like uh uh

2835.03 --> 2840.7400000000002
just squirting over it like that the jet

2839.3 --> 2842.59
sounds kind of harsh when I put it like

2840.74 --> 2846.2299999999996
that right but that's kind of what it is

2842.59 --> 2849.67
they're squirting over the the darkness

2846.23 --> 2852.59
of their own partner or whatever and

2849.67 --> 2854.89
then they go back at that Stockholm

2852.59 --> 2859.4300000000003
Syndrome type of fact well they kind of

2854.89 --> 2864.0499999999997
industrialized that made it part of

2859.43 --> 2866.75
media made it part of politics so it's

2864.05 --> 2869.1800000000003
almost like they're secretly engaging in

2866.75 --> 2874.46
intimate relations with people without

2869.18 --> 2876.8799999999997
them even realizing it and it makes them

2874.46 --> 2876.88
squirt

2882.09 --> 2885.2690000000002
[Music]

2886.14 --> 2889.14
yeah

2889.84 --> 2900.3700000000003
and you could also see that NASA and the

2895.45 --> 2902.89
space talks and science talks about

2900.37 --> 2904.54
space and all that that day that is kind

2902.89 --> 2906.52
of the same thing it's like yeah people

2904.54 --> 2908.5299999999997
can find out that it's wrong and then it

2906.52 --> 2912.52
hurts and then they're like you know

2908.53 --> 2917.6800000000003
they're gonna defend it no I won my

2912.52 --> 2920.02
space I want I want my playground it

2917.68 --> 2922.87
must be real because I need it to be

2920.02 --> 2924.16
real and even though these people that

2922.87 --> 2926.77
are telling me these stories are

2924.16 --> 2930.19
constantly like making fun of me like a

2926.77 --> 2932.46
jerk I ignore it because I need their

2930.19 --> 2932.46
feet

2937.06 --> 2940.62
because they need their squirt

2945.5 --> 2949.32
[Music]

2960.98 --> 2963.609
yeah

2966.15 --> 2973.17
and yeah getting off of this you know

2969.529 --> 2975.93
operation squid getting off squirt

2973.17 --> 2978.7200000000003
addiction which can be Stockholm

2975.93 --> 2980.279
Syndrome all that yeah the Stockholm

2978.72 --> 2982.1699999999996
Syndrome is pretty severe you know

2980.279 --> 2985.44
that's really when it becomes extremely

2982.17 --> 2988.17
visceral when there's like almost a

2985.44 --> 2992.7000000000003
puppet effect when it's become beyond

2988.17 --> 2994.799
just an emotional unbalance but yeah the

2992.7 --> 2998.7
squirting addiction is very tough to get

2994.799 --> 3001.7889999999998
over it requires you to confront

2998.7 --> 3005.5099999999998
yourself with what is actually causing

3001.789 --> 3007.73
the pain when something is dispelled

3005.51 --> 3009.529
when a dream is dispelled when the safe

3007.73 --> 3011.66
space is broken it requires you to

3009.529 --> 3013.43
confront what is actually causing the

3011.66 --> 3015.02
pain it's extremely unpleasant it's

3013.43 --> 3018.0789999999997
almost like you're a little kid again

3015.02 --> 3020.96
and you did something bad and you just

3018.079 --> 3024.77
want to go back to play but yeah your

3020.96 --> 3026.569
parents are like no you're a bad boy no

3024.77 --> 3029.329
you did something bad and you have to

3026.569 --> 3031.46
admit it and you have to make you have

3029.329 --> 3033.6800000000003
to show that you really mean it you have

3031.46 --> 3037.369
to learn from it and then it'll be okay

3033.68 --> 3040.549
but yeah no playtime until you do that

3037.369 --> 3043.4900000000002
and that's like really painful for a

3040.549 --> 3048.349
little kid but it's necessary you know

3043.49 --> 3050.4799999999996
and some kids out there never really had

3048.349 --> 3054.079
parents that could get themselves to be

3050.48 --> 3059.359
that strict so then they got squirting

3054.079 --> 3060.9500000000003
habits because nobody got strict with

3059.359 --> 3064.97
them and then if somebody gets strict

3060.95 --> 3068.0
with them it's so you like it hurts Wow

3064.97 --> 3070.6699999999996
I feel like a little kid again and it

3068.0 --> 3072.65
hurts and then they behave like little

3070.67 --> 3075.6800000000003
kid again because their own parents were

3072.65 --> 3078.339
too [ __ ] to do it at the time

3075.68 --> 3082.6299999999997
when they actually needed to do it

3078.339 --> 3084.97
because they were what seized liberals

3082.63 --> 3087.38
Kooks

3084.97 --> 3089.9199999999996
too scared to properly raise their own

3087.38 --> 3089.92
children

3105.019 --> 3119.8689999999997
getting sick your folks were scary as

3278.77 --> 3282.66
definitely going to be more up north

3304.8 --> 3307.9190000000003
[Music]

3318.34 --> 3321.53
[Music]

3324.26 --> 3332.63
it's my sound level low you say let me

3327.14 --> 3334.4
check uh yeah you're right what how does

3332.63 --> 3337.2200000000003
that thing no that doesn't make any

3334.4 --> 3354.8
sense this is the same levels why is it

3337.22 --> 3359.29
low what's going on ooh hello volume

3354.8 --> 3359.29
this way does that help that out no what

3360.28 --> 3367.73
okay I guess I'm gonna have to put it

3364.359 --> 3371.54
artificially higher weird what's going

3367.73 --> 3372.2
on OBS have something to do with an

3371.54 --> 3376.7
update

3372.2 --> 3380.02
come on and this is ridiculous hello

3376.7 --> 3385.339
hello hello better better okay I have to

3380.02 --> 3392.24
have to double the decibel series okay

3385.339 --> 3397.0099999999998
it's this No hello hello better better

3392.24 --> 3404.2299999999996
yeah okay it's still ridiculously low

3397.01 --> 3404.23
for some reason weird

3405.82 --> 3409.6200000000003
okay thank you for telling me

3418.91 --> 3432.14
it's still lowish yeah I know yeah I'll

3422.57 --> 3435.55
just set it to like seriously okay it's

3432.14 --> 3439.8199999999997
still low isn't it that's bizarre

3435.55 --> 3444.11
okay let's up it even further okay how

3439.82 --> 3448.7200000000003
about this better like this yeah yeah a

3444.11 --> 3451.67
little high maybe right this seems to be

3448.72 --> 3456.3799999999997
proper level I think if you don't get

3451.67 --> 3460.07
too close to the mic right okay yeah

3456.38 --> 3462.59
sorry it is technical it's weird like

3460.07 --> 3464.81
every time why does it typically do yeah

3462.59 --> 3469.34
I had an update with OBS recently so it

3464.81 --> 3472.43
just changed the balance of this of the

3469.34 --> 3476.59
volume scale for some reason why then

3472.43 --> 3476.5899999999997
why change that I don't know whatever

3477.07 --> 3482.9300000000003
messing with you no they're not

3479.57 --> 3485.2400000000002
it's just weird updating issues it seems

3482.93 --> 3488.3599999999997
to be typical and I even addressed it

3485.24 --> 3491.54
yesterday remember I had a whole piece

3488.36 --> 3495.6200000000003
about it about updates and how that it's

3491.54 --> 3498.92
like a programming thing whereby

3495.62 --> 3502.19
accidents old code has been taken and

3498.92 --> 3505.73
that kind of then yeah with an update

3502.19 --> 3509.69
certainly regresses but parts of yeah of

3505.73 --> 3511.52
the whole program it's like a mistake

3509.69 --> 3515.4500000000003
that typically happens maybe that's

3511.52 --> 3517.79
exactly what just happened here you know

3515.45 --> 3519.9199999999996
it's all programmers so human beings or

3517.79 --> 3524.45
most yeah I think most of it are human

3519.92 --> 3527.84
beings definitely especially that do the

3524.45 --> 3529.52
update work so

3527.84 --> 3536.42
that sort of thing is bound to happen

3529.52 --> 3541.28
constantly it was fine from the start

3536.42 --> 3544.27
okay well maybe you just turned on your

3541.28 --> 3544.27
volume kind of hi

3549.96 --> 3560.44
weird there is no this constant backdrop

3553.78 --> 3575.38
noise I see it's that let me try to get

3560.44 --> 3578.41
it again get it slower okay yeah how

3575.38 --> 3579.28
about now you can still hear me from

3578.41 --> 3582.31
this distance

3579.28 --> 3584.4
okay guess lower right right sorry this

3582.31 --> 3587.5299999999997
this is getting kind of silly just

3584.4 --> 3589.57
experimenting with my volume like that

3587.53 --> 3593.3500000000004
in the last part of the show I think I'm

3589.57 --> 3595.09
just gonna round out because unless you

3593.35 --> 3598.23
guys had more questions

3595.09 --> 3598.23
last minute

3609.27 --> 3616.619
right I turned my game down

3611.45 --> 3619.29
significantly is the sound better worse

3616.619 --> 3621.09
should I put it back up because I guess

3619.29 --> 3623.7799999999997
I'm gonna have to like rearrange my

3621.09 --> 3626.94
volume now maybe I'll do a specific test

3623.78 --> 3629.28
hangout or something somewhere oh right

3626.94 --> 3629.7200000000003
this weekend that's right I almost

3629.28 --> 3632.7200000000003
forgot

3629.72 --> 3632.72
hey

3645.22 --> 3659.1899999999996
right mark colored a pseudo coding yet

3649.64 --> 3660.94
the pre steps Amanda you I don't know I

3659.19 --> 3665.51
[Music]

3660.94 --> 3668.14
think she is but I don't know for sure I

3665.51 --> 3668.1400000000003
think she is

3679.52 --> 3684.65
but yeah she does all kinds of things

3681.62 --> 3688.63
yes they apparently she had this gamers

3684.65 --> 3691.58
dream because she likes Final Fantasy

3688.63 --> 3694.2200000000003
you don't think so okay what could be I

3691.58 --> 3698.38
don't know I it's just that she's had

3694.22 --> 3698.3799999999997
some subjects that I do find interesting

3729.24 --> 3758.72
all right getting sick Wow okay this

3752.61 --> 3763.1400000000003
does seem to have some side effects I

3758.72 --> 3765.6899999999996
need to fix this because I constantly

3763.14 --> 3768.33
see this noise level just constant so

3765.69 --> 3770.84
there must be like noise now this is not

3768.33 --> 3770.84
good okay

3797.77 --> 3807.74
what kind of a question is that more

3801.53 --> 3816.02
colored that's a false dichotomy kind of

3807.74 --> 3819.52
set question like why but haven't there

3816.02 --> 3819.52
been flu vaccines you know

3843.87 --> 3855.15
okay mark color well as long as it's

3848.61 --> 3857.8700000000003
trials you know just don't take it and

3855.15 --> 3861.14
don't buy into anything they say about

3857.87 --> 3861.14
about that

3907.53 --> 3912.82
right okay now I put my mindset to and

3911.17 --> 3921.19
that I was gonna do an hour show and

3912.82 --> 3927.6600000000003
then suddenly because now I wind it down

3921.19 --> 3935.9500000000003
in my energy it seems I'll try to

3927.66 --> 3939.93
continue also I'm just not happy with

3935.95 --> 3939.93
this stupid volume situation

3949.84 --> 3957.58
bata phantom really what where where do

3953.8 --> 3967.3500000000004
you base that where's that data what are

3957.58 --> 3969.46
you talking about because I don't know

3967.35 --> 3972.31
you know there's a lot of things

3969.46 --> 3978.07
literally stories being conjured up out

3972.31 --> 3981.19
and nothing so where's this the first

3978.07 --> 3983.7000000000003
vaccine which where when what are you

3981.19 --> 3983.7000000000003
talking about

3996.36 --> 4003.84
right okay

3999.09 --> 4007.8900000000003
yeah well the flu vaccine has always

4003.84 --> 4009.96
been just terrible I'd been aware of

4007.89 --> 4012.69
that for very long so I've never taken

4009.96 --> 4015.6
one ever and there's been people that I

4012.69 --> 4019.9500000000003
knew that did and they constantly had

4015.6 --> 4023.25
the flu drew of them nuts and I try to

4019.95 --> 4025.8599999999997
tell them like two it's giving it to you

4023.25 --> 4028.08
it's literally giving it to you you you

4025.86 --> 4032.4300000000003
want it to go away stop taking the

4028.08 --> 4034.83
freakin vaccines and I don't know for

4032.43 --> 4038.85
sure with how many of them I really got

4034.83 --> 4040.74
through to them because yeah once that

4038.85 --> 4042.06
gets conditioned in there it's very hard

4040.74 --> 4046.2599999999998
to let go it's like one of those

4042.06 --> 4048.81
mistakes based on the need of the idea

4046.26 --> 4051.7700000000004
that you could trust that and that'll

4048.81 --> 4054.18
actually help it's almost like a a

4051.77 --> 4056.73
conditioned trick that based on

4054.18 --> 4062.58
psychosomatic slike you want it to help

4056.73 --> 4064.44
and then if it doesn't yeah it becomes

4062.58 --> 4070.02
like a squirt thing but it's really

4064.44 --> 4072.03
damaging but yeah it's tough to convince

4070.02 --> 4075.03
people that are used to doing that to

4072.03 --> 4077.9700000000003
step away from it sometimes unless

4075.03 --> 4080.13
they're just ready and and they're just

4077.97 --> 4082.14
sick of it literally or spiritually and

4080.13 --> 4085.31
they're like this is crazy

4082.14 --> 4085.31
it never really help

4098.21 --> 4107.33
all right yeah whatever just I don't

4105.44 --> 4109.339
even want to talk about it you know it

4107.33 --> 4113.35
disgusts me the whole thing disgusts me

4109.339 --> 4113.35
I hate vaccines I always have

4120.42 --> 4125.2300000000005
and I'm kind of sad that when I was

4123.31 --> 4128.110000000001
younger I was foolish enough to kind of

4125.23 --> 4133.049999999999
trust it but then again a lot felt

4128.11 --> 4135.549999999999
forced back then so and then I tried to

4133.05 --> 4138.13
approach it differently it's basically

4135.55 --> 4141.070000000001
like okay if I must take that [ __ ] for

4138.13 --> 4142.99
whatever reason I hadn't the power or

4141.07 --> 4146.65
authority to do anything about it

4142.99 --> 4149.26
or so it seemed to me then I just

4146.65 --> 4153.099999999999
believed in it so that it would not

4149.26 --> 4159.34
damage me as much so I wouldn't be in a

4153.1 --> 4161.38
bad state when that [ __ ] hit me but now

4159.34 --> 4163.3
I'm talking like very young and in a way

4161.38 --> 4171.34
I did trust my parents my parents did

4163.3 --> 4173.8
believe in that kind of stuff I don't

4171.34 --> 4178.35
have polio or measles right why I didn't

4173.8 --> 4178.35
I haven't been vaccinated for that I

4178.86 --> 4185.53
think no right definitely not polio

4183.1 --> 4188.05
that's but my parents even knew that

4185.53 --> 4192.16
that was dangerous I think my parents

4188.05 --> 4194.610000000001
were a lot more informed for yeah at

4192.16 --> 4194.61
that time

4199.22 --> 4202.339
[Music]

4203.27 --> 4210.84
what is the measles again I might have

4206.79 --> 4215.0
had the measles I definitely had

4210.84 --> 4215.0
chickenpox and still has its marks

4228.389 --> 4238.59
right beta phantom well I I kind of

4231.33 --> 4243.33
abided by that concept to that yeah it's

4238.59 --> 4246.63
just like is it really really necessary

4243.33 --> 4249.989
when there's so many much more natural

4246.63 --> 4254.54
ways to achieve the same effect so let's

4249.989 --> 4263.57
just go dig in the dirt eat some dirt

4254.54 --> 4266.639
this or you know so many odd things mms

4263.57 --> 4269.79
turpentine Big Bear apparently swears by

4266.639 --> 4272.969
that is it exactly the same is it that I

4269.79 --> 4274.5
don't know for sure I don't really like

4272.969 --> 4279.84
the idea of that I haven't tried to

4274.5 --> 4282.96
pretend it's but I don't know at some

4279.84 --> 4287.76
point I might be convinced to do that as

4282.96 --> 4291.09
a like short cure but I've tried many

4287.76 --> 4295.070000000001
other things and yeah it's like why

4291.09 --> 4297.81
would you even try the vaccine system

4295.07 --> 4300.42
when you could bring yourself in the

4297.81 --> 4303.51
state without expending a lot of money

4300.42 --> 4307.26
or get a lot of stress to simply not get

4303.51 --> 4309.09
sick anymore by anything sounds like a

4307.26 --> 4312.4800000000005
much better option to me that just

4309.09 --> 4316.32
inject you with risky [ __ ] and toxic

4312.48 --> 4319.199
stuff in order to get specific immunity

4316.32 --> 4322.799999999999
against something that you would really

4319.199 --> 4329.21
only contract if your system wasn't all

4322.8 --> 4329.21
that healthy anyway you know

4340.73 --> 4347.969999999999
used to play near raw sewage at the

4343.56 --> 4349.92
beach right well I've had my own type of

4347.97 --> 4352.9800000000005
situations concerning that it was

4349.92 --> 4355.76
interesting when I was a kid that there

4352.98 --> 4358.259999999999
were there said yeah we went to Spain at

4355.76 --> 4361.77
vacation summer vacations along with my

4358.26 --> 4365.25
parents from a very young age on from

4361.77 --> 4368.52
like yeah I think even when I was five

4365.25 --> 4370.38
or something we did that and there were

4368.52 --> 4373.05
beaches and stuff but there were also

4370.38 --> 4376.74
beaches there where like this river

4373.05 --> 4379.47
mount ended up right and there was

4376.74 --> 4384.57
sewage in that river as well it had a

4379.47 --> 4386.85
weird very sweet smell to the river not

4384.57 --> 4388.65
even like disgusting not no methane type

4386.85 --> 4391.650000000001
of disgusting [ __ ] there were no turds

4388.65 --> 4393.87
floating around as far as I remember no

4391.65 --> 4397.74
they were pretty sure there weren't but

4393.87 --> 4399.75
I did just like yes I didn't not had in

4397.74 --> 4401.639999999999
there I would never want to get that

4399.75 --> 4406.47
kind of water in my ears for example

4401.64 --> 4409.14
yeah but I did just like yeah fool

4406.47 --> 4415.110000000001
around in that [ __ ] 10 almost literally

4409.14 --> 4422.349
and I think that probably yeah was a

4415.11 --> 4425.739
good thing in retrospect I think

4422.349 --> 4431.349
it should be I don't know I think I

4425.739 --> 4435.789
don't get really badly sick I have some

4431.349 --> 4439.53
issues but it's not it's more having to

4435.789 --> 4442.599
do with my energy and strain

4439.53 --> 4445.3
psychological things rather than my body

4442.599 --> 4447.969
giving out no absolutely not no I

4445.3 --> 4449.859
sometimes I even have the tendency to

4447.969 --> 4451.9890000000005
underestimate the strength of my own

4449.859 --> 4454.269
health where I'm like oh my god is

4451.989 --> 4456.759999999999
something going wrong and doesn't like

4454.269 --> 4459.789000000001
calm the [ __ ] down and it's like no

4456.76 --> 4461.9490000000005
that's absolutely not what happening I'm

4459.789 --> 4464.879
doing perfectly fine I have to be

4461.949 --> 4464.879
reminded sometimes

4487.96 --> 4493.06
what

4489.619 --> 4493.0599999999995
that's ridiculous you have a

4497.19 --> 4500.28
[Music]

4505.02 --> 4511.8
it did you know by the way you have that

4508.77 --> 4514.67
there's been studies this from a while

4511.8 --> 4519.33
ago though but that turbo burt

4514.67 --> 4521.97
tuberculosis it is potentially yeah if

4519.33 --> 4524.94
your immune system is very wickets

4521.97 --> 4528.63
dangerous right can be just like against

4524.94 --> 4532.049999999999
cancer and all that but that at the same

4528.63 --> 4536.25
time it has a very interesting proven

4532.05 --> 4540.27
side function that if you for example

4536.25 --> 4542.7
have cancer naturally like like a lump

4540.27 --> 4544.71
and and you don't you don't be a [ __ ]

4542.7 --> 4548.67
and get chemotherapy and all that [ __ ]

4544.71 --> 4551.25
just like ignore it let it rest take

4548.67 --> 4556.08
care of it that it is that it seems that

4551.25 --> 4561.35
turbo closest has this unique function

4556.08 --> 4566.9
that it consumes like worn-out tumors

4561.35 --> 4566.900000000001
really has anybody else heard of that

4567.32 --> 4575.849999999999
it's yeah so even turbulent debt having

4573.02 --> 4583.59
problems pronouncing the word but even

4575.85 --> 4586.56
if that that tuberculosis even seems to

4583.59 --> 4594.56
be a potential integral part of the

4586.56 --> 4594.56
biome in a way yeah there you go

4596.039 --> 4601.768999999999
right well if you're gonna pump anything

4598.38 --> 4611.309
full with with antibiotics then it's

4601.769 --> 4615.3
gonna ruin any organism you know it also

4611.309 --> 4618.869000000001
eats up your lungs does it does it

4615.3 --> 4622.6990000000005
really or does it only do that if you

4618.869 --> 4622.699
are in severely weakened conditions

4630.48 --> 4633.169999999999
right

4642.62 --> 4651.08
I don't know but maybe the tuberculosis

4647.68 --> 4653.570000000001
maybe this tuberculosis that we know now

4651.08 --> 4659.39
is just nothing like the original

4653.57 --> 4663.849999999999
natural tuberculosis because of

4659.39 --> 4667.43
everything that man has done with it as

4663.85 --> 4671.150000000001
yeah as you said before giants amount of

4667.43 --> 4673.33
die giant amounts of antibiotics and all

4671.15 --> 4673.33
that

4687.98 --> 4693.54
cytokine storm huh right bit of phantom

4691.02 --> 4696.150000000001
yeah yeah that's it's all to me

4693.54 --> 4698.67
literally all of it all of nature and

4696.15 --> 4703.199
and the diseases and it's all and part

4698.67 --> 4707.55
of Nate it's all like a giant

4703.199 --> 4711.239
civilization like we are the cities and

4707.55 --> 4714.389
the biome are its residence everything

4711.239 --> 4716.218999999999
about it and when it's all just kind of

4714.389 --> 4720.63
left alone and there's nobody being

4716.219 --> 4723.449
persecuted and the cities are thriving

4720.63 --> 4725.429
get enough food and all that of the

4723.449 --> 4728.0
right kind and not not too much

4725.429 --> 4730.8
pollution then everything thrives and

4728.0 --> 4733.73
everything performs better to its

4730.8 --> 4738.63
function it's almost just like humans

4733.73 --> 4740.669999999999
right so are you gonna take one of these

4738.63 --> 4745.46
biome things and then see or they are

4740.67 --> 4748.139
invaders they're they're white males

4745.46 --> 4754.35
they're evil we have to get rid of them

4748.139 --> 4758.12
they see how similar that mindset

4754.35 --> 4758.120000000001
approach is in a way

4763.54 --> 4768.57
I take this analogy very seriously I

4766.3 --> 4774.51
really do feel like it sometimes like

4768.57 --> 4779.19
you people men and women are like cities

4774.51 --> 4782.17
like giant city-states for the micro

4779.19 --> 4785.589999999999
organisms which have jobs in there which

4782.17 --> 4792.01
are part of it but also outside and it's

4785.59 --> 4794.68
just a giant world very big and yeah

4792.01 --> 4797.17
every city is gonna have their own

4794.68 --> 4799.84
policies and some of them are terrible

4797.17 --> 4801.79
and that those terrible policies have

4799.84 --> 4807.31
consequences for their biome and that

4801.79 --> 4810.25
bio may even like spread out in it's bad

4807.31 --> 4815.02
way maybe in very specific circumstances

4810.25 --> 4817.42
if other city-states are also bad doing

4815.02 --> 4822.280000000001
kind of the same thing it spreads like a

4817.42 --> 4825.9400000000005
mindset like an idea mm-hmm a bad idea

4822.28 --> 4828.28
so see and and I think that even good

4825.94 --> 4831.879999999999
biome can do the same thing with good

4828.28 --> 4833.92
ideas that good biomes good bacteria

4831.88 --> 4836.32
good organisms that they will restore

4833.92 --> 4839.47
become more natural and actually start

4836.32 --> 4841.48
performing unique functions that we

4839.47 --> 4844.09
don't even fully realize that probably

4841.48 --> 4846.419999999999
the ancients and the Druids especially

4844.09 --> 4846.42
did

4872.87 --> 4875.87
right

4882.66 --> 4887.3099999999995
[Music]

4888.659 --> 4894.8099999999995
right yeah the more I hear about viruses

4893.31 --> 4897.27
and how they work the more they just

4894.81 --> 4900.63
remind me of like construction workers

4897.27 --> 4903.870000000001
if you have to like continue the analogy

4900.63 --> 4906.6900000000005
of the micro city-state world and all

4903.87 --> 4909.8099999999995
that it's just like workers yeah they

4906.69 --> 4913.589999999999
get in the way and all that but they

4909.81 --> 4917.34
mostly just maintain like the their

4913.59 --> 4919.469
residences you know the cells and then

4917.34 --> 4923.610000000001
they add things designated for

4919.469 --> 4926.159
demolition and yeah if if the planning

4923.61 --> 4928.429
in the city goes all wrong well guess

4926.159 --> 4931.5
what's gonna happen

4928.429 --> 4935.1
yeah they're gonna I don't know there

4931.5 --> 4938.27
may be like corruption and then things

4935.1 --> 4942.51
go wrong and who knows what happens

4938.27 --> 4945.06
it's like criminal corruption among the

4942.51 --> 4947.219
viruses are among the builders or

4945.06 --> 4949.5
something and then yeah all kinds of

4947.219 --> 4955.139
[ __ ] goes wrong I don't know I like the

4949.5 --> 4956.76
metaphor I really think that that

4955.139 --> 4959.179
looking it like that is much more

4956.76 --> 4959.179
sensible

4960.93 --> 4964.329000000001
[Music]

4977.709 --> 4986.459
of course they did better fathom of

4980.05 --> 4986.459
course they did it's just horrific

4990.73 --> 4999.91
yet I I don't like that at all you know

4994.98 --> 5003.929999999999
like Brazil has some interesting things

4999.91 --> 5008.76
to it but they it's just that they

5003.93 --> 5011.31
really are it has an a hostile attitude

5008.76 --> 5016.14
towards these completely independent

5011.31 --> 5019.740000000001
almost wild tribes it's there's no

5016.14 --> 5026.6900000000005
reason for that except for just just

5019.74 --> 5029.61
greed he died okay

5026.69 --> 5033.75
well yeah you know if people in those

5029.61 --> 5037.2
tribes may still die especially if they

5033.75 --> 5039.54
live out in the wild well that actually

5037.2 --> 5042.389999999999
makes them less likely to die but it'll

5039.54 --> 5045.6
still happen who knows they maybe they

5042.39 --> 5047.490000000001
just heard somebody died there and then

5045.6 --> 5052.35
they just marked it as corona death

5047.49 --> 5055.11
maybe it was like that or tests

5052.35 --> 5058.26
contaminated with the virus or who knows

5055.11 --> 5061.049999999999
what the tests is contaminated with the

5058.26 --> 5065.13
virus would that matter does that do

5061.05 --> 5069.59
anything or is it just poison or

5065.13 --> 5069.59
something I don't know man I don't know

5071.51 --> 5075.06
I'm not even gonna I don't even want to

5074.16 --> 5079.459
speculate about it

5075.06 --> 5079.459000000001
[Music]

5090.84 --> 5093.53
hmm

5105.03 --> 5113.63
yeah but he was tested positive positive

5108.24 --> 5117.929999999999
for what for a general coronavirus

5113.63 --> 5120.4800000000005
because yeah that everybody or a lot of

5117.93 --> 5124.26
people can get that normally because

5120.48 --> 5127.5599999999995
it's part of the biome everywhere so

5124.26 --> 5129.42
that the whole test thing it doesn't

5127.56 --> 5132.0
mean anything until they literally say

5129.42 --> 5136.22
you have this very specific one here is

5132.0 --> 5136.22
the evidence and it takes a while

5159.82 --> 5166.03
according to the news oh yeah okay well

5162.47 --> 5166.030000000001
that doesn't mean anything then

5170.26 --> 5175.9800000000005
[Music]

5173.3 --> 5178.02
yeah well benefit him I kind of don't

5175.98 --> 5181.65
care anymore so please drop it now I'm

5178.02 --> 5187.9490000000005
done about this nonsense it doesn't do

5181.65 --> 5190.29
anything viruses don't do anything not

5187.949 --> 5197.5199999999995
by themselves it's they're just a

5190.29 --> 5200.55
response team so you know in in from

5197.52 --> 5202.910000000001
white from the metaphor view what is

5200.55 --> 5206.400000000001
this most like is almost like okay a

5202.91 --> 5209.13
bunch of workers from a foreign country

5206.4 --> 5212.04
have been gathered up and then they're

5209.13 --> 5213.51
just inserted into the other country

5212.04 --> 5215.489
even though they can't really speak

5213.51 --> 5218.67
their language but they they have

5215.489 --> 5220.32
received contracts so they think so

5218.67 --> 5222.9490000000005
they're just trying to go to work even

5220.32 --> 5226.349999999999
though it's like Oh foreign and [ __ ]

5222.949 --> 5227.79
that's it and hey if they're like gonna

5226.35 --> 5229.469
disrupt things that are going on because

5227.79 --> 5231.42
they didn't understand they're gonna

5229.469 --> 5235.969
keep be arrested by the police and then

5231.42 --> 5235.969
I don't know deport it or whatever

5236.51 --> 5243.6900000000005
that's kind of how I see it

5238.59 --> 5247.79
it's like viruses don't do anything it's

5243.69 --> 5247.79
the poison that does things

5255.03 --> 5262.0199999999995
I have a know I'm not much of a board

5257.969 --> 5265.889
game or no I have in the past basic

5262.02 --> 5268.409000000001
board games but you know board the board

5265.889 --> 5270.17
games just kind of like Legos is always

5268.409 --> 5281.73
more like an assist

5270.17 --> 5285.8
it's vert it's visual assistance and so

5281.73 --> 5285.799999999999
it's the board element to the D&D game

5287.57 --> 5292.32
unless you emphasize the game itself

5290.489 --> 5294.5
more on the board and have like all

5292.32 --> 5300.2699999999995
these pieces and then it becomes like

5294.5 --> 5302.429
almost like a Lego world with D&D you

5300.27 --> 5305.7300000000005
know yeah it depends on how much time

5302.429 --> 5306.5
and money you have left for that kind of

5305.73 --> 5312.178999999999
thing

5306.5 --> 5314.849
there are quite elaborate D&D like

5312.179 --> 5317.4490000000005
dungeon building block elements and

5314.849 --> 5320.82
boards out there like huge amounts

5317.449 --> 5324.089999999999
there's even like 3d virtual systems for

5320.82 --> 5326.73
it I think I had a pretty old one that

5324.09 --> 5331.289
it was kind of broken but we still used

5326.73 --> 5335.669999999999
it called map tool you can actually use

5331.289 --> 5338.489
that live during a game session was

5335.67 --> 5341.579
interesting outworked because they had

5338.489 --> 5344.61
like line-of-sight with vector block

5341.579 --> 5346.0199999999995
graphics and light sources and it's very

5344.61 --> 5349.848999999999
fascinating what you could do with it

5346.02 --> 5349.849
but the system itself was kind of broken

5361.61 --> 5367.259999999999
[Music]

5363.669 --> 5371.11
right you have okay well those types of

5367.26 --> 5375.969
D&D or role-playing games that's more

5371.11 --> 5380.409
the a pure spoken game I've done those

5375.969 --> 5382.059
where yeah where it's just speaking it

5380.409 --> 5384.57
all depends on the game masters you know

5382.059 --> 5389.469
there are some game masters that just

5384.57 --> 5391.63
basically like the acting and they do

5389.469 --> 5394.539
that is like everything becomes about

5391.63 --> 5397.659000000001
acting and then almost like in almost

5394.539 --> 5401.079
like improv in a way but more guided by

5397.659 --> 5404.919
game rules some game masters like that

5401.079 --> 5407.349
yeah like oral tradition based D&D and

5404.919 --> 5409.389
then some where those that are like more

5407.349 --> 5411.999
about the technicals and movies like the

5409.389 --> 5413.559
math the formulas and the balance of

5411.999 --> 5417.159
that things and how to build your

5413.559 --> 5419.26
character slowly that those types more

5417.159 --> 5421.36
did I guess typical technical gamer

5419.26 --> 5426.030000000001
types that I am among those I literally

5421.36 --> 5430.688999999999
wrote the thousand page book about rules

5426.03 --> 5433.179
so yeah and boards for me are like a

5430.689 --> 5435.729
Virtual Assistants just to clear it up

5433.179 --> 5440.26
because there are so many rules to

5435.729 --> 5444.459
oversee it's crazy sometimes I feel like

5440.26 --> 5447.669
I'm a lawyer in the game keeping track

5444.459 --> 5451.239
of [ __ ] and don't always do so success I

5447.669 --> 5454.059
literally made my players sometimes to

5451.239 --> 5454.78
keep track of the rules for me to check

5454.059 --> 5457.2390000000005
on me

5454.78 --> 5460.63
if I've done the rules properly because

5457.239 --> 5463.209
it's so much you really need everybody

5460.63 --> 5465.249
to keep the rule system going properly

5463.209 --> 5468.07
together it's it's weird how it works

5465.249 --> 5470.919
sometimes but besides the technical part

5468.07 --> 5475.659
there is also the absolute the character

5470.919 --> 5478.03
acting and just the morality and like

5475.659 --> 5480.098999999999
their identity in my game

5478.03 --> 5485.05
the character's identity is very

5480.099 --> 5487.57
profound very worked out and they also

5485.05 --> 5491.169
have the room to basically even retro

5487.57 --> 5493.478999999999
actively build like a past story so they

5491.169 --> 5497.469
almost become like movie heroes in a way

5493.479 --> 5499.360000000001
but I don't like let them squirt

5497.469 --> 5502.78
you know not too much it has to have a

5499.36 --> 5505.299999999999
balanced purpose it has to have genuine

5502.78 --> 5508.86
balanced character to it so they always

5505.3 --> 5511.570000000001
have to have flaws and then they must

5508.86 --> 5513.039
understand that flaw you know and if

5511.57 --> 5515.92
they don't want it then they don't have

5513.039 --> 5519.039
to take it but if they take a flaw and

5515.92 --> 5521.229
they like really work on that flaw to

5519.039 --> 5523.15
integrate it with the character and let

5521.229 --> 5525.4890000000005
them have a real learning curve now you

5523.15 --> 5528.789
have a real virtual person that you

5525.489 --> 5532.69
mentally made and agree upon it's a

5528.789 --> 5535.268999999999
fascinating ordeal there's like real

5532.69 --> 5538.15
virtual characters that have legend that

5535.269 --> 5542.820000000001
I've worked with with my gamers for now

5538.15 --> 5545.86
years characters that have had lives and

5542.82 --> 5548.949
a history and all kinds of developments

5545.86 --> 5551.799999999999
and like character like everybody of our

5548.949 --> 5554.379999999999
group knows exactly how each character

5551.8 --> 5559.03
would respond facing a certain type of

5554.38 --> 5561.849
situation and they spend a lot of time

5559.03 --> 5564.759999999999
even trying to surprise the others like

5561.849 --> 5566.349
ha this is how they reason this out

5564.76 --> 5569.889
specifically you hadn't thought of that

5566.349 --> 5572.349
that he could be like that right so we

5569.889 --> 5574.3
all then like yeah we agree this is a

5572.349 --> 5580.03
good development for that character see

5574.3 --> 5582.219
it's in a way you could consider that

5580.03 --> 5586.63
yeah we're all playing around with our

5582.219 --> 5589.539
dolls again just like in Spaceballs if

5586.63 --> 5593.11
you if you want to get silly for it

5589.539 --> 5595.15
about that but is a very interesting

5593.11 --> 5599.079
learning experience it's like you you

5595.15 --> 5602.379999999999
you have a combined book you're writing

5599.079 --> 5605.469
together in your minds mostly but also

5602.38 --> 5608.4400000000005
we do have some feel like a story that

5605.469 --> 5610.3
is being told about them but we really

5608.44 --> 5612.879999999999
know who they are more than anything and

5610.3 --> 5615.099
sometimes I try to then express that

5612.88 --> 5618.150000000001
also and and quote them because they

5615.099 --> 5621.28
literally say things that are very

5618.15 --> 5623.259999999999
characteristics and then we all agree

5621.28 --> 5625.3
and then it's put into the writing like

5623.26 --> 5627.9400000000005
they say it said this because that's a

5625.3 --> 5629.96
very character like moment for them that

5627.94 --> 5632.75
kind of defines them for

5629.96 --> 5637.19
ciders see that's that's what we're

5632.75 --> 5641.17
doing in a way it is a very serious

5637.19 --> 5641.169999999999
psychological project

5650.239 --> 5659.509999999999
well 30 years epic or creepy depends you

5656.54 --> 5664.31
know a lot of D&D gamers over the ages

5659.51 --> 5666.38
turn into absolute squids so but man 30

5664.31 --> 5675.7390000000005
years that's one hell of an adventure

5666.38 --> 5677.9890000000005
you know what I mean right about 15

5675.739 --> 5680.48
years over time some of them come

5677.989 --> 5682.929999999999
turning into complete squids you know

5680.48 --> 5682.929999999999
what I mean right

5684.07 --> 5688.82
all right their families and kids okay

5686.75 --> 5702.82
well those are less likely to become

5688.82 --> 5702.82
squids I want to be one of them as well

5703.12 --> 5707.2
gotta find the right one though

5728.78 --> 5734.409
but they will ended up weird no matter

5731.389 --> 5734.409000000001
what they did in life

5738.53 --> 5746.329
that I don't know what that means you

5740.48 --> 5749.919999999999
have you know getting sick you don't

5746.329 --> 5753.94
wanna be a squid squids are squishy

5749.92 --> 5757.7300000000005
they're very soft and very dense

5753.94 --> 5766.94
mentally and they get obsessive and they

5757.73 --> 5769.459999999999
suck they literally they suck yeah I

5766.94 --> 5773.058999999999
don't like eating squid either although

5769.46 --> 5777.65
it is apparently healthy I don't like it

5773.059 --> 5781.1900000000005
I never liked it and I don't really like

5777.65 --> 5785.659
the taste either oh and by the way which

5781.19 --> 5787.848999999999
is an odd factoid - is that what most

5785.659 --> 5794.5
people don't realize is that calamari

5787.849 --> 5798.289
are actually pretty weirdly intelligent

5794.5 --> 5804.309
like really like jello fish are

5798.289 --> 5809.0
obviously like almost plant like but

5804.309 --> 5811.969
calamari are actually like halfway or

5809.0 --> 5815.15
maybe yeah to a degree have sentience

5811.969 --> 5821.559
it's weird they're actually kind of

5815.15 --> 5821.558999999999
smart and they have strategies and [ __ ]

5825.5 --> 5830.91
so that's makes it very fitting because

5828.03 --> 5837.24
squids are not dumb people they're just

5830.91 --> 5841.349999999999
complete fools most of the time right

5837.24 --> 5854.91
mark color see so just because they're

5841.35 --> 5857.58
fools doesn't mean they're dumb yes lots

5854.91 --> 5860.28
are interesting creatures they're like

5857.58 --> 5862.98
almost like a living forest in a way

5860.28 --> 5865.71
they they are always filled up with like

5862.98 --> 5870.719999999999
all these they sometimes have moths in

5865.71 --> 5873.63
their skin and like all these the algae

5870.72 --> 5875.25
and things they can have like an entire

5873.63 --> 5879.77
forest on their skin because they're

5875.25 --> 5886.89
just so slow it just settles

5879.77 --> 5890.660000000001
it's weird can you imagine that there

5886.89 --> 5895.77
would be like a a colossal sloth that

5890.66 --> 5899.46
would be like a hundred feet big or

5895.77 --> 5901.410000000001
something and then it would just be

5899.46 --> 5904.59
lying around and you did wouldn't even

5901.41 --> 5907.95
notice it was a sloth because it's just

5904.59 --> 5909.99
standing still or just lying on the

5907.95 --> 5914.58
ground it's completely covered in moss

5909.99 --> 5918.0199999999995
or whatever and then Sully's like and

5914.58 --> 5923.12
it's like a moving hill like what

5918.02 --> 5923.120000000001
sorry my imagination it must be the DNA

5927.53 --> 5933.41
yeah our bar stuff still yeah it's like

5931.43 --> 5935.570000000001
and there's some freaking dangerous

5933.41 --> 5939.95
squids out there too like the vampire

5935.57 --> 5942.95
squids we've seen those very large like

5939.95 --> 5946.76
super bright red squids and they're

5942.95 --> 5948.71
extremely hostile like they just come at

5946.76 --> 5955.58
you and they take a giant bite out of

5948.71 --> 5957.8
you out of nothing just bang I've heard

5955.58 --> 5960.68
of those that that's a creature you

5957.8 --> 5965.14
don't want to meet as a diver when

5960.68 --> 5965.14
you're yeah in the deep sea

5966.52 --> 5973.089000000001
[Music]

5993.68 --> 6003.8
yeah Gideon see I don't know I don't

5996.81 --> 6007.01
know about octopi I don't know if octopi

6003.8 --> 6010.43
are as intelligent as squids because if

6007.01 --> 6013.400000000001
you just look at what they do they don't

6010.43 --> 6017.450000000001
really seem to need to be because what

6013.4 --> 6020.089999999999
octopi mostly do is just hide and then

6017.45 --> 6023.8099999999995
if something comes by just bit get it

6020.09 --> 6025.37
while squids are like herd animals and

6023.81 --> 6029.54
stuff and they do all kinds of things

6025.37 --> 6031.34
and they hunt in the open waters so

6029.54 --> 6034.22
squids are very have a different

6031.34 --> 6036.5
different naturist octopi I don't know

6034.22 --> 6038.06
if octopi are as intelligence as squids

6036.5 --> 6041.24
I think in Switzer probably more

6038.06 --> 6045.29
intelligent but hey I am NOT a marine

6041.24 --> 6049.849999999999
biologist I haven't I don't have the

6045.29 --> 6052.73
statistics but I think there might be

6049.85 --> 6054.88
some out there that could back me up in

6052.73 --> 6054.879999999999
this

6057.929 --> 6060.77
are they

6064.369 --> 6074.57
okay okay well I might have been wrong

6067.4 --> 6079.699
about the octopi who knows you know it's

6074.57 --> 6082.07
such a weird creature like octopi like

6079.699 --> 6085.91
every time it's like what what is that

6082.07 --> 6089.1089999999995
it's octopi are just freaking weird I

6085.91 --> 6089.1089999999995
[Music]

6089.409 --> 6096.739
know when I see living squids I still

6092.239 --> 6099.049999999999
have some kind of weird with octopi

6096.739 --> 6102.44
they're like really alien to me to my

6099.05 --> 6105.1990000000005
senses but squids less they're still

6102.44 --> 6107.598999999999
very different but they still have like

6105.199 --> 6114.83
these I don't know they still have

6107.599 --> 6118.09
something it was just our frequency it's

6114.83 --> 6120.86
a little bit closer to my type of being

6118.09 --> 6123.349
this is not saying that I'm a squid by

6120.86 --> 6129.429
the way then it's just as a human being

6123.349 --> 6129.429
as a as a man it's what we are

6141.73 --> 6145.99
yeah largest eye in the animal kingdom

6144.1 --> 6153.31
is on a giant squid

6145.99 --> 6156.25
yeah it is massive it's crazy and weird

6153.31 --> 6159.070000000001
their eyes are weird too I don't even

6156.25 --> 6164.08
think their eyes are round they're like

6159.07 --> 6167.65
this more like a flat it's like it's

6164.08 --> 6170.23
like a water bowl almost that just has

6167.65 --> 6176.099999999999
like a lens covering it's weird than

6170.23 --> 6180.959999999999
their eyes right dinner plate size

6176.1 --> 6180.96
I've seen them it's yeah

6197.63 --> 6204.400000000001
ah Hobbit really wow I didn't know that

6201.95 --> 6209.83
or I forgot about it

6204.4 --> 6209.83
mm-hmm that is so typical

6216.25 --> 6219.88
yeah squids

6229.21 --> 6232.909
[Music]

6264.03 --> 6270.63
oh right that's right yeah Yaba yes some

6268.74 --> 6274.469999999999
squids or maybe all of them they also

6270.63 --> 6278.43
have like this chromatic skin ability

6274.47 --> 6282.66
right they can like go flashing like

6278.43 --> 6286.26
hypnotize you with colors it's

6282.66 --> 6288.09
fascinating what they can do and they

6286.26 --> 6302.360000000001
can use it like a cloaking device very

6288.09 --> 6302.360000000001
elegantly eloquently

6302.63 --> 6307.39
sorry mixing up words

6322.23 --> 6326.53
octopi solving puzzles awesome that is

6325.54 --> 6330.1
so weird

6326.53 --> 6332.679999999999
that it's really cool I know that birds

6330.1 --> 6337.860000000001
gonna do that especially like crows and

6332.68 --> 6337.860000000001
such very smart tool users

6346.199 --> 6348.919999999999
right

6351.659 --> 6357.638999999999
animals learning to use tools well what

6355.419 --> 6361.148999999999
it really requires is like object

6357.639 --> 6365.889
awareness that you can isolate an object

6361.149 --> 6371.019
other than food and the environment if

6365.889 --> 6374.469
you can like recognize objects as

6371.019 --> 6377.319
separate things from your environment or

6374.469 --> 6379.929
your food then if you have that

6377.319 --> 6381.669000000001
capability in your mind set switch and

6379.929 --> 6385.4490000000005
approach you know if you have that base

6381.669 --> 6390.129
psychology viability then yeah using

6385.449 --> 6392.289
tools that'll happen instead of it just

6390.129 --> 6396.459
being the environment needing to get

6392.289 --> 6398.999
that out of the way or if a it's funny

6396.459 --> 6398.999
how that works

6409.3 --> 6412.43
[Music]

6427.46 --> 6430.46
hmm

6437.659 --> 6443.0199999999995
ah that is amazing Kaaba that is

6441.5 --> 6449.38
brilliant

6443.02 --> 6460.85
crows dropping nuts on the road that is

6449.38 --> 6464.83
that's cool they could be a little risky

6460.85 --> 6467.780000000001
though if it's a very high traffic road

6464.83 --> 6473.63
because then they'd have to catch it

6467.78 --> 6476.57
after but if it's a regular road where

6473.63 --> 6479.17
just sometimes the car comes by yeah

6476.57 --> 6479.17
that's really smart

6493.119 --> 6498.179
yeah authoress that's right

6515.77 --> 6521.9800000000005
yeah and yeah and it it also in a way

6519.85 --> 6525.46
even gets a little bit more mechanical

6521.98 --> 6528.969999999999
the tools that is for example chickens I

6525.46 --> 6532.4800000000005
think some other birds too they eat

6528.97 --> 6535.21
rocks like small pebbles they eat them

6532.48 --> 6538.12
and they know they're rocks it's not an

6535.21 --> 6540.97
axe they eat them so that they use them

6538.12 --> 6541.89
basically as a mill in their very

6540.97 --> 6545.89
stomach

6541.89 --> 6548.410000000001
it's that integrated it isn't that

6545.89 --> 6551.05
amazing really when you think about

6548.41 --> 6554.38
that's pretty amazing that that's just

6551.05 --> 6558.4800000000005
that that's just there they eat rocks to

6554.38 --> 6558.4800000000005
use as natural mill stones

6562.7 --> 6565.76
[Music]

6580.11 --> 6589.53
we're in with tanks using Spears to

6582.659 --> 6591.71
catch fish yep oh yeah that's pretty

6589.53 --> 6591.71
awesome

6596.34 --> 6601.5
would be fascinating to have a skill

6599.04 --> 6605.48
like that like I'd be personally

6601.5 --> 6608.67
interested to do that if there is like a

6605.48 --> 6611.82
clear spring like really clear water and

6608.67 --> 6620.16
there is fish in there to try to do that

6611.82 --> 6621.71
for food I don't know maybe make fish

6620.16 --> 6624.72
oil out of it or something like

6621.71 --> 6627.26
wild-caught fish oil whoo I like the

6624.72 --> 6627.26
idea of that

6637.01 --> 6646.68
mark alert sex diplomacy yeah

6641.3 --> 6647.820000000001
bonobos do use sex diplomacy not just

6646.68 --> 6651.27
bonobos you know

6647.82 --> 6653.79
well they for them it's like common but

6651.27 --> 6659.820000000001
there's a lot of ape types that do that

6653.79 --> 6663.18
but they do it more as socially normal

6659.82 --> 6666.9
yeah well it depends on the species and

6663.18 --> 6669.96
the type I guess but yeah sex diplomacy

6666.9 --> 6672.32
this is it's not just human beings that

6669.96 --> 6672.32
do that

6686.68 --> 6692.83
and even in a way I think it's also a

6689.59 --> 6695.29
pretty cool concept that certain herd

6692.83 --> 6696.51
animals will have like shared parent

6695.29 --> 6700.9
they will share parenting

6696.51 --> 6703.84
responsibilities as well you know that

6700.9 --> 6707.339999999999
they don't just obsessively look out for

6703.84 --> 6715.27
their own offspring but that they will

6707.34 --> 6719.29
like help functions with others and that

6715.27 --> 6723.34
for example if a mother dies while still

6719.29 --> 6726.28
having a little one that that yeah

6723.34 --> 6728.56
there's uh yeah that sometimes or I

6726.28 --> 6732.37
don't know often sometimes that they

6728.56 --> 6734.35
just get adopted by another oh you bet

6732.37 --> 6736.96
you that those others know that they're

6734.35 --> 6739.900000000001
not just gonna be like oh I never knew I

6736.96 --> 6744.28
had an extra kid no they know they know

6739.9 --> 6747.78
I think that's interesting I think it's

6744.28 --> 6747.78
interesting that that's all out there

6774.33 --> 6780.99
animals must have souls too or is soul

6777.95 --> 6784.7699999999995
spirit consciousness three separate

6780.99 --> 6788.46
things what are they really are you know

6784.77 --> 6793.160000000001
I think affronted through my healer

6788.46 --> 6795.99
mostly but there's something that our

6793.16 --> 6798.0599999999995
general Western understanding of the

6795.99 --> 6802.44
concept soul and even through

6798.06 --> 6807.09
Christianity is like is probably

6802.44 --> 6808.7699999999995
technically kind of confusing because

6807.09 --> 6810.81
there are there's just yeah there's

6808.77 --> 6817.35
another system I think I mentioned it

6810.81 --> 6819.6
before but I'm not yeah I'm not ready to

6817.35 --> 6822.0
just put it out just like that I need to

6819.6 --> 6826.89
refine it a little bit first but I think

6822.0 --> 6829.94
that the consciousness is really what

6826.89 --> 6832.740000000001
astonish us the most because then like

6829.94 --> 6834.03
techniques are developed by animals and

6832.74 --> 6838.29
all that and that's like a sign of

6834.03 --> 6843.17
consciousness in a way but the soul from

6838.29 --> 6849.99
what I've heard is more about the

6843.17 --> 6852.84
earthly survival need the it's like the

6849.99 --> 6857.7
the yeah this spirit in a way a part of

6852.84 --> 6861.6
the spirit that requires you to take

6857.7 --> 6865.5199999999995
yourself seriously and build and like

6861.6 --> 6869.7300000000005
that also provides I guess a connection

6865.52 --> 6872.46
to natural energy that I don't know it's

6869.73 --> 6877.049999999999
difficult but it's another approach it's

6872.46 --> 6880.02
not like it's not about the the identity

6877.05 --> 6882.09
entity that could supposedly be snatched

6880.02 --> 6883.950000000001
away from you or something like that

6882.09 --> 6887.76
although yeah if you think about it like

6883.95 --> 6889.679999999999
that taking your soul away making

6887.76 --> 6892.71
somebody like completely depressed

6889.68 --> 6895.26
taking away their purpose that does take

6892.71 --> 6901.35
away the natural energy that makes

6895.26 --> 6903.26
people do things and have a life so is

6901.35 --> 6908.240000000001
it that far off

6903.26 --> 6910.58
I don't know but I'll try to elaborate

6908.24 --> 6913.04
about this an another show sometime it's

6910.58 --> 6917.63
yeah little impromptu bring that up out

6913.04 --> 6919.85

6923.93 --> 6929.990000000001

6925.97 --> 6932.12
hungry and it's been interesting I

6929.99 --> 6936.429999999999

right so 512 special because it is a

6998.05 --> 7006.909000000001
multiplication of 2 it is

7004.21 --> 7009.34

7042.59 --> 7045.14
imprinted on me those numbers have been

7044.27 --> 7048.620000000001

7045.14 --> 7051.200000000001
I don't know happened since the

7048.62 --> 7053.12
