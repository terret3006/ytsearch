a financial situation is not exactly

116.579 --> 121.38
great right now

119.46 --> 125.6
it's been a tough

121.38 --> 125.6
more than a week on the live

125.759 --> 131.879
uh

128.06 --> 134.78
right but I'm back on YouTube

131.879 --> 134.78
finally

135.3 --> 141.9
anyway the weather today is cold it was

139.98 --> 143.28
freezing this night and there's still

141.9 --> 145.44
like ice

143.28 --> 148.14000000000001
on the roof

145.44 --> 149.94
and on the trees it's been like Misty

148.14 --> 151.5
and Frozen

149.94 --> 153.78
so

151.5 --> 156.06
pretty rough weather out there this

153.78 --> 158.4
night for the birds

156.06 --> 162.599
because like there's just this Mist

158.4 --> 165.3
hanging around and it's been like uh

162.599 --> 166.44
so it's sublimating turning directly

165.3 --> 172.09900000000002
from the

166.44 --> 172.099
Mist into ice everywhere like a glazing

173.879 --> 178.07999999999998
so yeah it's cold out there I don't know

175.92 --> 180.379
if it's still freezing I'll check the

178.08 --> 180.37900000000002
temperature

183.14 --> 187.92
[Music]

185.459 --> 189.48

[Music]

226.62 --> 229.459
I mean

230.459 --> 234.78
I'm glad it's there

232.62 --> 236.81900000000002
otherwise I wouldn't have been streaming

234.78 --> 239.18
all week

236.819 --> 244.04
because it is really the only suitable

239.18 --> 244.04000000000002
alternative platform to live stream from

244.08 --> 248.64000000000001
that I've come across

246.12 --> 250.14000000000001
so far I mean maybe rockfin or something

248.64 --> 254.17999999999998
but

250.14 --> 254.17999999999998
yeah I'm not going there

254.59 --> 258.18
[Music]

255.78 --> 259.72
right so yeah

258.18 --> 260.94
like on YouTube

259.72 --> 265.04
[Music]

260.94 --> 265.04
got some unsettling news though

269.34 --> 274.919
be not nice to start out my return on

272.46 --> 278.34
YouTube with but yeah

274.919 --> 280.02
apparently good servant Stephen you

278.34 --> 282.17999999999995
might remember him he used to come here

280.02 --> 283.68
a lot he's been on with me a couple of

282.18 --> 287.84000000000003
shows

283.68 --> 287.84000000000003
apparently he passed away recently

287.94 --> 294.479
in his sleep

290.46 --> 296.88
now he was having severe health issues

294.479 --> 299.88
for a very long time and suffering and

296.88 --> 303.18
like well he's been doing a lot of live

299.88 --> 304.56
streams like on a daily basis sometimes

303.18 --> 307.199
multiple

304.56 --> 309.0
kind of to get attention because yeah I

307.199 --> 310.44
was going through a rough time pretty

309.0 --> 312.24
much all the time

310.44 --> 313.259
I was just trying to get it spit his

312.24 --> 317.28000000000003
spirits up

313.259 --> 320.22
like I'm focusing on Christ and all that

317.28 --> 322.32
but yeah apparently that we don't know

320.22 --> 324.12
yet how

322.32 --> 327.12
like it might have been like an

324.12 --> 329.34000000000003
accidental overdose or something I think

327.12 --> 331.919
because I think he was being prescribed

329.34 --> 334.79999999999995
fentanyl I I think I remember him

331.919 --> 337.02
telling me like a month ago or something

334.8 --> 341.24
on one of his streams

337.02 --> 341.24
but apparently yeah it uh

342.06 --> 347.36
it went wrong somehow and he passed away

344.759 --> 347.36
in his sleep

347.72 --> 354.91900000000004
makes me really sad in a way

351.96 --> 354.919
because I

354.96 --> 359.63899999999995
yeah

357.36 --> 362.22
I really like the guy

359.639 --> 364.62
he was a really good guy

362.22 --> 367.8
really good

364.62 --> 370.56
and yeah I might have not been the the

367.8 --> 372.539
most brilliant person or the most

370.56 --> 374.22
eloquent speaker but he was just a

372.539 --> 376.259
really good guy

374.22 --> 379.56
and he had nothing but

376.259 --> 383.22
like his response to his own desperation

379.56 --> 384.96
and hurt is to just give love to others

383.22 --> 387.84000000000003
and

384.96 --> 389.88
and I I don't know in my mind I thought

387.84 --> 391.919
that maybe one day I wouldn't meet him

389.88 --> 394.08
or something

391.919 --> 397.69899999999996
and so yeah

394.08 --> 397.699
I'm kind of sad about that

403.319 --> 410.46000000000004
so yeah good servant it's even rest in

406.919 --> 412.85999999999996
peace man you definitely deserve it

410.46 --> 415.62
you deserve your peace

412.86 --> 417.58000000000004
and I know God's gonna give it to you

415.62 --> 420.779
foreign

417.58 --> 420.779
[Music]

423.62 --> 427.04
[Music]

433.5 --> 437.3
well there was not really a conflict

435.96 --> 441.25899999999996
there was like a really big

437.3 --> 441.259
misunderstanding at one point

443.16 --> 448.139
and yeah I get pissed off especially

445.56 --> 451.44
when I see somebody's going astray and I

448.139 --> 453.72
can't correct them but

451.44 --> 456.02
foreign that doesn't mean we're not

453.72 --> 456.02000000000004
friends

456.06 --> 461.58
I get a lot more passionate about it

459.06 --> 464.419
when I actually do feel close to

461.58 --> 464.419
somebody so

465.96 --> 468.44
right

474.26 --> 478.68
[Music]

475.62 --> 484.68
anyway I just found this out

478.68 --> 488.52
like an hour ago so a little off guard

484.68 --> 491.12
I was actually feeling really good today

488.52 --> 491.12
getting back

503.58 --> 506.84
right anyway

507.2 --> 511.69
[Music]

517.56 --> 522.5
man

519.36 --> 522.5
let's check the temperature

523.26 --> 527.659
[Music]

528.36 --> 534.32
one degree Celsius oh goody

531.6 --> 534.32

537.959 --> 542.4799999999999
gonna freeze six degrees hmm

552.12 --> 557.279
right anyway

554.82 --> 559.5
if you guys missed me I kind of missed

557.279 --> 562.68
you guys

559.5 --> 565.8
or some of you I mean on their life

562.68 --> 569.0
there was not a lot of people

565.8 --> 571.8
some of you made an account on the live

569.0 --> 574.08
to basically come by and I really

571.8 --> 576.68
appreciate that because it was very

574.08 --> 576.6800000000001
frustrating

579.899 --> 585.24
but I had some good shows there still

582.36 --> 588.24
and I downloaded them

585.24 --> 590.88
I'm not sure yet if I'm gonna do it but

588.24 --> 593.9590000000001
I could like try to upload them but I at

590.88 --> 593.959
least have them on my computer

594.48 --> 599.479
uh

595.32 --> 599.479
[Music]

600.899 --> 604.8
right I'm totally now like

603.42 --> 609.26
[Music]

604.8 --> 609.26
out of focus in my mind

609.36 --> 614.16
yeah yesterday was a kind of a rough day

612.51 --> 615.3
[Music]

614.16 --> 618.899
I mean

615.3 --> 621.899
Flat Earth debates was pretty cool and

618.899 --> 625.019
then the after show just went on and on

621.899 --> 626.459
and on and well in this case Tony went

625.019 --> 629.04
kind of Berserk

626.459 --> 632.279
well for his he basically went super

629.04 --> 635.279
over excited and couldn't stand down

632.279 --> 638.12
and it got so bad at some point that I

635.279 --> 638.12
had to leave

639.72 --> 644.279
because I was literally just yelling in

642.899 --> 648.06
the mic

644.279 --> 650.579
are trying to like get through to him

648.06 --> 653.3389999999999
and apparently that was so loud that

650.579 --> 654.5999999999999
even like yeah my roommate was all she

653.339 --> 656.4590000000001
was all

654.6 --> 659.22
like

656.459 --> 661.14
hurt by it apparently when I went to the

659.22 --> 664.62
toilet take a break it was like almost

661.14 --> 666.18
crying complaining and like we do

664.62 --> 669.86
what the [ __ ]

666.18 --> 669.8599999999999
just having a heated debate man

670.5 --> 675.12
I wasn't crying but it did

673.69 --> 677.7600000000001
[Music]

675.12 --> 679.94
was just very tense day yesterday I

677.76 --> 679.9399999999999
think

680.04 --> 682.88
foreign

694.399 --> 700.56
right now he was kind of like reifying

701.22 --> 705.8000000000001
like correlation and causation

706.2 --> 710.82
it was it was he was basically getting

708.3 --> 713.8199999999999
sort of judicially inspired and he was

710.82 --> 716.22
rambling on about how

713.82 --> 720.9590000000001
uh

716.22 --> 723.0
how acting like J trick literally means

720.959 --> 724.8
your paid controlled opposition by

723.0 --> 727.279
inference and that was just totally

724.8 --> 729.54
wrong and he kept on saying that over

727.279 --> 732.12
not literally like that we was

729.54 --> 734.519
constantly pushing that no if they're

732.12 --> 737.1
acting the same then that means they are

734.519 --> 739.26
that's proof literally said that it's

737.1 --> 741.72
proof then

739.26 --> 744.06
and try to point out no correlation is

741.72 --> 746.0400000000001
not causation instead that like multiple

744.06 --> 748.68
times but he just ignored it

746.04 --> 750.8389999999999
even though eventually even Nathan tried

748.68 --> 753.5999999999999
to point it out

750.839 --> 756.0600000000001
it's just extremely rowdy

753.6 --> 758.94
and I like dropped but that was like

756.06 --> 761.399
after six so it was like a five hour

758.94 --> 764.399
show five hour after show or something

761.399 --> 764.399
crazy

764.41 --> 767.5699999999999
[Music]

767.639 --> 771.139

774.42 --> 777.63

778.86 --> 783.66
hey Adam making good to see you

782.08 --> 786.6600000000001
[Music]

783.66 --> 786.66

789.57 --> 792.609
[Music]

815.93 --> 819.13
[Music]

822.05 --> 825.24
[Music]

828.24 --> 833.5790000000001
oh man the cold is taking a bit of a

831.72 --> 836.899
toll on me

833.579 --> 836.899
check my PayPal oh

837.48 --> 840.5
I will

841.14 --> 844.289
[Music]

845.279 --> 850.74
but like when I go to bed I literally

847.56 --> 853.1999999999999
like I have to have the window open I

850.74 --> 857.42
cannot like sleep

853.2 --> 857.4200000000001
with no fresh air available

858.0 --> 860.12
yeah

860.41 --> 866.9399999999999
[Music]

862.579 --> 869.8199999999999
nobody gets really cold

866.94 --> 872.4590000000001
[Music]

869.82 --> 874.0790000000001
and I basically try to compensate that

872.459 --> 876.2399999999999
with like

874.079 --> 879.7199999999999
hot water

876.24 --> 879.72
the thing

880.079 --> 885.8
bottle rubber bottle whoa where is Gee

887.94 --> 893.7790000000001
bro

889.32 --> 893.779
thank you so much that's incredible

895.32 --> 900.3000000000001
all right by the way are you back on

897.36 --> 903.0
your feet because I thought

900.3 --> 904.8
that you were kind of sick recently that

903.0 --> 905.94
you told me over Skype I hope you're

904.8 --> 908.399
better now

905.94 --> 911.0600000000001
anyway thank you so much

908.399 --> 913.15
in this

911.06 --> 915.7199999999999
you're a lifesaver

913.15 --> 919.519
[Music]

915.72 --> 919.519
I really needed that

927.839 --> 930.85
feeling much better Ah that's great to

930.42 --> 936.18
hear

930.85 --> 938.399
[Music]

936.18 --> 940.56
yeah I'm also feeling good and now I'm

938.399 --> 943.199
not worried about anymore so much about

940.56 --> 947.06
finances on the short run but I'm still

943.199 --> 947.06
a bit emotionally distraught

950.399 --> 957.36
nuclear power yeah

954.06 --> 959.459
I am a proponent of nuclear power

957.36 --> 962.5790000000001
but it yeah it depends on if they're

959.459 --> 965.399
gonna actually build like one of the the

962.579 --> 969.0
newest models because the problem with

965.399 --> 971.699
nuclear power in general was all these

969.0 --> 973.98
outdated power plants like these very

971.699 --> 976.88
old I think that were like built in the

973.98 --> 976.88
60s or something

977.82 --> 984.839
nuclear power plants that were not very

981.779 --> 986.76
if yeah not very

984.839 --> 989.2790000000001
secure

986.76 --> 991.4399999999999
well I know that there's like newer

989.279 --> 993.36
designs that have already been built

991.44 --> 996.5400000000001
that that are like Pro have perfect

993.36 --> 999.48
Fail-Safe mechanisms like if power went

996.54 --> 1001.88
down even by for example like an EMP or

999.48 --> 1006.019
something like All Electronics go dead

1001.88 --> 1008.56
then it automatically just by mechanic

1006.019 --> 1008.5600000000001
my

1009.079 --> 1014.779
physical mechanics

1011.12 --> 1016.88
will basically prevent itself from going

1014.779 --> 1019.639
meltdown

1016.88 --> 1021.38
like with a passive security system that

1019.639 --> 1024.199
basically can break

1021.38 --> 1026.959
I I know these exist

1024.199 --> 1030.26
and if it's those models yeah I'm

1026.959 --> 1032.679
absolutely for it fantastic

1030.26 --> 1032.679
anyway

1033.02 --> 1037.8799999999999
the issue is though that yeah it's

1035.54 --> 1039.98
pretty cool but yeah when is that going

1037.88 --> 1041.959
to be finished I mean

1039.98 --> 1043.699
I bet that's not gonna be finished this

1041.959 --> 1047.66
winter

1043.699 --> 1047.66
yeah see 2035.

1048.199 --> 1051.04
all right

1053.24 --> 1056.919
Z is a lamp

1057.98 --> 1063.46
two power plants in that Village in

1060.559 --> 1063.46
Zealand okay

1076.64 --> 1079.1200000000001
all right

1081.5 --> 1087.44
but yeah how is this gonna work though

1085.46 --> 1089.48
you mean I mean who's gonna actually

1087.44 --> 1090.799
manage it is is it going to be a

1089.48 --> 1093.679
National Asset

1090.799 --> 1096.4
and does that mean they're gonna sell it

1093.679 --> 1101.0590000000002
off again to the private sector

1096.4 --> 1103.52
eventually or like the second it's built

1101.059 --> 1107.32
because we're dealing with like these

1103.52 --> 1107.32
disgusting globalists still

1107.96 --> 1114.58
and they do that

1111.02 --> 1114.58
they just give [ __ ] away

1116.96 --> 1122.9
type 3 plus reactor okay

1120.32 --> 1124.8999999999999
okay government and the private sector

1122.9 --> 1124.9
um

1131.539 --> 1137.539
okay right but anyway I mean it's better

1135.08 --> 1140.5
than freaking windmills

1137.539 --> 1142.52
okay windmills are [ __ ] up

1140.5 --> 1145.1
[Music]

1142.52 --> 1148.059
and they they bring health problems when

1145.1 --> 1148.059
you live by them

1149.179 --> 1153.6200000000001
so there was some Professor like there

1151.34 --> 1155.4189999999999
was a Dutch news article recently that's

1153.62 --> 1158.36
funny

1155.419 --> 1161.539
of some doctor that basically did start

1158.36 --> 1165.26
has made a study about how it influences

1161.539 --> 1168.2
like heart health in a really bad way

1165.26 --> 1169.7
when you live close to them and like he

1168.2 --> 1171.02
was censored

1169.7 --> 1175.28
for that

1171.02 --> 1177.559
because the windmill industry ordered it

1175.28 --> 1180.02
they said like no

1177.559 --> 1182.66
you can't say that

1180.02 --> 1185.72
yeah they kill animals too that's right

1182.66 --> 1188.179
but it's just bad windmills are not

1185.72 --> 1191.559
effective they're polluting

1188.179 --> 1191.5590000000002
and they're unhealthy

1197.179 --> 1204.44
and they're not reliable

1200.179 --> 1204.44
because they don't deliver continually

1204.98 --> 1207.16
foreign

1212.32 --> 1216.3899999999999
turbine generator yeah that's a good way

1215.36 --> 1219.3999999999999
to do it yeah yeah

1216.39 --> 1221.419
[Music]

1219.4 --> 1224.1200000000001
what I mean if you're going to build

1221.419 --> 1226.94
something large scale than a nuclear

1224.12 --> 1229.4799999999998
power plant a modern one I think is a

1226.94 --> 1229.48
good idea

1233.48 --> 1237.8600000000001
I've never had any objections to nuclear

1236.24 --> 1241.82
power

1237.86 --> 1243.3799999999999
also because well I think that a lot of

1241.82 --> 1246.74
these

1243.38 --> 1250.0390000000002
stories concerning radioactive material

1246.74 --> 1253.94
and all that have been

1250.039 --> 1253.94
fictionally exaggerated

1254.48 --> 1259.46
I don't think

1256.16 --> 1263.2
the material is even close to being as

1259.46 --> 1263.2
dangerous as they suggest it is

1265.64 --> 1270.14
and I don't think there's such a thing

1267.5 --> 1273.559
possible as critical mass

1270.14 --> 1276.8600000000001
right I mean even with Fukushima there

1273.559 --> 1279.74
was which it was kind of up close yeah

1276.86 --> 1282.1599999999999
looking at through in focus and all that

1279.74 --> 1286.4
and other other videos

1282.16 --> 1289.52
studies I mean yeah the danger is

1286.4 --> 1291.919
hydrogen explosion

1289.52 --> 1293.96
that's the danger that typically happens

1291.919 --> 1296.2990000000002
because there's water involved with the

1293.96 --> 1299.3600000000001
cooling and then if that goes wrong then

1296.299 --> 1302.539
the water starts to turn into hydrogen

1299.36 --> 1304.6399999999999
and then that can blow up

1302.539 --> 1307.76
that's pretty that's just explosion

1304.64 --> 1310.22
danger but there is no like oh no the

1307.76 --> 1314.02
land is all polluted I mean I'm pretty

1310.22 --> 1314.02
sure that Fukushima is just fine

1315.2 --> 1318.559
and

1316.64 --> 1320.3600000000001
so is Chernobyl

1318.559 --> 1325.059
that's just fine

1320.36 --> 1325.059
I mean there is no issue there at all

1325.22 --> 1328.94
right

1326.539 --> 1330.26
so I don't mind having that in the

1328.94 --> 1332.9
Netherlands

1330.26 --> 1336.3799999999999
and who knows what what's gonna happen

1332.9 --> 1338.0
maybe dude like I wouldn't care even if

1336.38 --> 1341.0590000000002
there was like an accident or something

1338.0 --> 1342.86
and like oh no and then oh the media is

1341.059 --> 1344.84
going to be like oh God the Netherlands

1342.86 --> 1348.6789999999999
is going to be this and that it's just

1344.84 --> 1350.84
all horseshit all of it I mean if

1348.679 --> 1353.0590000000002
there's going to be a meltdown then yeah

1350.84 --> 1356.9599999999998
don't

1353.059 --> 1360.76
don't have your cows milk from that

1356.96 --> 1360.76
direct area I get it right

1362.96 --> 1366.1000000000001
that's about it

1381.32 --> 1389.559
now God that thing steamy Traveler

1384.74 --> 1389.559
this is crazy Arabian project

1395.84 --> 1402.02
right so anyway I am very much for

1398.9 --> 1405.679
nuclear power over wind power absolutely

1402.02 --> 1408.9189999999999
replace it replace it all

1405.679 --> 1412.22
right to be fair I don't want windmills

1408.919 --> 1415.179
anymore they should remove them all

1412.22 --> 1418.1000000000001
just build power plants

1415.179 --> 1421.9
instead nuclear ones

1418.1 --> 1421.8999999999999
and get rid of the windmills

1421.94 --> 1427.46
I think that pretty much everybody at

1425.24 --> 1429.799
this point that is living around

1427.46 --> 1432.44
windmills would agree

1429.799 --> 1435.74
to that move

1432.44 --> 1440.38
I love chocolate saying good to see you

1498.02 --> 1504.02

1500.36 --> 1506.6
right yeah but that's because of the way

1504.02 --> 1509.86
they look they're pizzaresque

1506.6 --> 1509.86
they're not destructive

1512.299 --> 1517.039
yeah but definitely not these power

1514.88 --> 1519.3400000000001

Jim Bob's stream yesterday was talking

1542.24 --> 1546.26
about that

1543.62 --> 1549.4399999999998
but I don't really have

1546.26 --> 1551.12
an agenda for it so I might just alter

1549.44 --> 1553.779
it later

1551.12 --> 1553.779

1555.5 --> 1559.72

1629.779 --> 1636.44
whole nuclear power industry

1633.38 --> 1639.5800000000002
nonsense the nonsense that surrounds it

1636.44 --> 1639.5800000000002
it is like a scam

1639.919 --> 1645.44
it's it's kind of like almost like an

1643.22 --> 1648.14
insurance scam

1645.44 --> 1651.3400000000001
right because the risks are super

1648.14 --> 1654.74
overplayed and then the need of

1651.34 --> 1656.539
procedures and security and checkups and

1654.74 --> 1659.24
everything

1656.539 --> 1663.02
well that's like an insurance scam it

1659.24 --> 1666.26
basically forces the participant to buy

1663.02 --> 1669.74
into all that like a scam like an

1666.26 --> 1672.58
insurance scam that is forced right I

1669.74 --> 1672.58
mean normal insurance

1672.74 --> 1677.0
well yeah the problem is that it like if

1674.84 --> 1680.059
you're a big company and you have a lot

1677.0 --> 1683.559
of workers then you like are kind of

1680.059 --> 1686.12
forced to use insurance as well

1683.559 --> 1688.6399999999999
sometimes if it's like a big model like

1686.12 --> 1690.5
you must do that otherwise you like it

1688.64 --> 1694.1000000000001
you're not allowed

1690.5 --> 1695.48
to do that or you'll be barred Etc and

1694.1 --> 1698.1789999999999
the same goes

1695.48 --> 1700.94
for the nuclear power industry except if

1698.179 --> 1703.7
you don't abide it's not just like oh no

1700.94 --> 1706.539
you probably get like

1703.7 --> 1709.4
yeah the big countries trying to

1706.539 --> 1712.52
basically destroy it

1709.4 --> 1714.799
right like in Top Gun too

1712.52 --> 1716.72
right

1714.799 --> 1718.46
at least in their minds everybody's

1716.72 --> 1721.419
going to be set against you like what's

1718.46 --> 1721.419
happening in Iran

1721.52 --> 1727.4
because they want nuclear power

1724.34 --> 1731.539
yet they're being sabotaged like

1727.4 --> 1732.74
continually especially by Israel

1731.539 --> 1735.46
's nose

1732.74 --> 1735.46
at this point

1735.679 --> 1740.659
it's because they probably don't want to

1738.02 --> 1742.76
play along with the scam

1740.659 --> 1744.2800000000002

1865.36 --> 1870.4399999999998

1868.279 --> 1873.52
like

1870.44 --> 1877.1000000000001
fresh air directly out of a tube without

1873.52 --> 1879.44
cooling everything off

1886.039 --> 1892.76
yeah but it's uh

1889.1 --> 1894.98
kind of tough so I wanted it warm or and

1892.76 --> 1898.0
run out of air or do I want fresh air

why did they just use like the

sonar scan right which they also use to

2100.66 --> 2105.46
basically scan through the dirt it can't

2103.06 --> 2108.099
scan through a rock but this can can

2105.46 --> 2111.52
scan through dirt this looks like it's

2108.099 --> 2114.28
basically being made in dirt

2111.52 --> 2117.52
why don't they get that device

2114.28 --> 2121.1800000000003
down there and just like scan the ground

2117.52 --> 2124.359
like to literally have a sonogram as to

what's going on beneath there

2124.359 --> 2128.74
that could be a way to figure out what's

I see plenty of flashlights they very

rarely have three dimensionality to him

2636.46 --> 2643.96
actually well usually Shadows are flat

2640.18 --> 2649.48
because it's a shadow on a flat surface

2643.96 --> 2652.9
in fact it is a segment of a Arc of a

2649.48 --> 2654.94
circle no matter the orientation of the

2652.9 --> 2657.1600000000003
Moon and the Sun orientation in your

2654.94 --> 2658.839
presupposed falling around a sphere

2657.16 --> 2659.98
Earth that isn't what the case is though

2658.839 --> 2661.42
you've just begged the question of all

2659.98 --> 2662.7400000000002
of that you've not validated any of it

2661.42 --> 2664.54
and the assumptions required have all

2662.74 --> 2665.3799999999997
been debunked by us again please share

2664.54 --> 2667.3
the show

2665.38 --> 2670.0
and the only thing that makes a

2667.3 --> 2673.2400000000002
perfectly circular Shadow be something

2670.0 --> 2675.099
that's perfectly circular perfectly

2673.24 --> 2677.9199999999996
spherical spherical right more about

2675.099 --> 2680.88
going red what does that is that a

2677.92 --> 2680.88
shadow when it goes red

2681.359 --> 2686.2
you haven't explained what I preserved I

2684.4 --> 2688.54
mean you know I mean I'm just a mere man

2686.2 --> 2690.0989999999997
looking at a Moon turning red and going

2688.54 --> 2692.319
what the hell is that

2690.099 --> 2695.079
meaning everything about it what is the

2692.319 --> 2697.9
moon what's it doing why is it in the

2695.079 --> 2700.42
sky why is it turning red why did it go

2697.9 --> 2701.56
extremely cold when it turned red none

2700.42 --> 2704.2000000000003
of those things

2701.56 --> 2706.42
describe Shadows to me

2704.2 --> 2708.9399999999996
like none of them

2706.42 --> 2711.2200000000003
so the only thing that makes a perfect

2708.94 --> 2713.38
circle Shadow every single time oh

2711.22 --> 2717.0989999999997
Shadow you've assumed it's a shadow

2713.38 --> 2719.079
is a perfect sphere right okay well if

2717.099 --> 2721.48
it's occulting it the light from the sun

2719.079 --> 2723.46
that is so if we're a sphere and we're

2721.48 --> 2725.7400000000002
between the Moon and the Sun definitely

2723.46 --> 2727.839
not the salaninian eclipse would

2725.74 --> 2729.8799999999997
demonstrate that there's nothing that

2727.839 --> 2732.88
could be described as Earth as a sphere

2729.88 --> 2734.02
between those two Celestial items you

2732.88 --> 2735.76
can't describe them that way when

2734.02 --> 2738.7
they're both above the Horizon what's

2735.76 --> 2740.6800000000003
occulting what nothing basically so what

2738.7 --> 2742.72
what do you guys call that the

2740.68 --> 2744.0989999999997
impossible Eclipse no very much a

2742.72 --> 2745.9599999999996
possibility when we're watching it

2744.099 --> 2747.099
happen it's just impossible in your

2745.96 --> 2748.66
stupid model

2747.099 --> 2750.52
because you've got it occulting and

2748.66 --> 2753.66
causing Shadows whereas when it starts

2750.52 --> 2755.8
turning red and the sun's still there

2753.66 --> 2758.3799999999997
obviously it's not an occultation that's

2755.8 --> 2760.3
causing it to turn red I mean cause a

2758.38 --> 2762.099
shadow as you assume it and none of

2760.3 --> 2763.3
that's true none of it represents

2762.099 --> 2766.06
anything that I've observed in this

2763.3 --> 2767.7400000000002
regard it's a disc it would only make a

2766.06 --> 2769.839
perfect circle if you land it that way

2767.74 --> 2772.2999999999997
right in a straw man heliocentric

2769.839 --> 2774.5789999999997
orbital motion that needed a flat Earth

2772.3 --> 2776.619
elevation angle measurement to derive in

2774.579 --> 2778.119
the first instance and then reinserted

2776.619 --> 2779.6800000000003
into that heliocentric model after

2778.119 --> 2781.359
measuring the Flat Earth elevation angle

2779.68 --> 2782.859
measurements from a flat plane and

2781.359 --> 2785.56
converting it from the celestial sphere

2782.859 --> 2788.14
model with its equatorial flat plane by

2785.56 --> 2790.24
way of have a sign into your Globe to

2788.14 --> 2792.5789999999997
further Advance your R value into a

2790.24 --> 2793.66
Venus with an R value that's assumed and

2792.579 --> 2795.819
then Kepler's third law of

2793.66 --> 2798.94
interplanetary motion with a flat disc

2795.819 --> 2801.099
inserted thereafter a tohoshit yeah

2798.94 --> 2803.079
notice how easy and succinct it was for

2801.099 --> 2804.4
me to pull apart that straw man in its

3121.74 --> 3127.4399999999996

3125.579 --> 3130.2000000000003
some prices

3127.44 --> 3132.359
of some products suddenly jump

3130.2 --> 3134.46

3132.359 --> 3137.339
it's still like more expensive and then

3134.46 --> 3139.51
others don't and then after a while they

accidental like fentanyl overdose or

3178.859 --> 3182.2999999999997

3297.119 --> 3300.079
it's just

3303.119 --> 3310.46
it was just a really good guy and he was

3306.18 --> 3312.98
suffering but he was so brave and so

3310.46 --> 3316.5
light-hearted

3312.98 --> 3317.339
about this situation

3316.5 --> 3319.02
okay

3317.339 --> 3321.0589999999997
and

3319.02 --> 3325.46
yeah I don't know there was something

3321.059 --> 3325.46
about it and I really appreciated that

3325.559 --> 3330.1400000000003
it was certainly wasn't his like his

3328.38 --> 3333.0
vernacular

3330.14 --> 3336.0

3333.0 --> 3340.52
mean but beside that there was something

3336.0 --> 3340.52
about him that was just really awesome

3348.119 --> 3356.88
so yeah a specific memory is tough

3352.26 --> 3360.0200000000004
I guess that like a whole while back

3356.88 --> 3360.02
when was that

3363.24 --> 3368.7
maybe was that it like in 2019 or

3367.02 --> 3373.04
something

3368.7 --> 3373.04
wow this is three years ago

3373.05 --> 3377.28
[Music]

3374.46 --> 3380.46
in like around when

3377.28 --> 3384.1800000000003
I was gonna go to

3380.46 --> 3386.4
uh the yeah the Amsterdam conference

3384.18 --> 3389.22
I had appeared where I got really sick

3386.4 --> 3391.14
and then he kind of helped me yeah that

3389.22 --> 3392.7599999999998
was 2019.

3391.14 --> 3395.94
yeah

3392.76 --> 3397.619
and we basically talked over Skype and I

3395.94 --> 3402.14
revealed a whole bunch of personal

3397.619 --> 3402.1400000000003
things that I normally wouldn't

3402.96 --> 3408.3
and he was just so

3405.92 --> 3411.359
understanding like even though he didn't

3408.3 --> 3414.98
cognitively understand he is feeling

3411.359 --> 3414.98
what's just so good

3418.02 --> 3425.059
so yeah that's just the guy just had a

3421.02 --> 3425.059
heart of gold he really did

3428.76 --> 3434.3390000000004
and sometimes he would be like too

3431.46 --> 3436.079
forgiving to people that I don't feel

3434.339 --> 3438.2999999999997
deserve it right

3436.079 --> 3441.54
it would just be like no just be nice

3438.3 --> 3443.819
and it'll be all right like naive like

3441.54 --> 3445.92
that but still that's still very

3443.819 --> 3448.14
invigorating to see I mean I'd much

3445.92 --> 3451.92
rather see somebody

3448.14 --> 3455.0989999999997
be just naively forgiving then like

3451.92 --> 3457.319
overly paranoid right because there's

3455.099 --> 3459.8500000000004
plenty of that [ __ ] and that's not

3457.319 --> 3463.5099999999998
pleasant at all

3459.85 --> 3463.5099999999998
[Music]

3464.76 --> 3468.44
yeah that's right steam Traveler

3469.38 --> 3474.44
and we had like Skype calls even and all

3472.26 --> 3474.44
that

3477.68 --> 3482.04
you are we losing

3479.88 --> 3485.339
[Music]

3482.04 --> 3486.7799999999997
I mean good servant had a bad condition

3485.339 --> 3489.44
for a while

3486.78 --> 3489.44
so

3490.11 --> 3494.76
[Music]

3491.819 --> 3497.4
I mean even on his own shows he

3494.76 --> 3502.28
periodically shared how we thought that

3497.4 --> 3502.28
he probably was gonna die somewhere

3503.76 --> 3507.96
I guess that he felt it coming in some

3505.92 --> 3510.0
way

3507.96 --> 3511.559
it wasn't he wouldn't like depress

3510.0 --> 3513.42
people with it but he would like

3511.559 --> 3516.48
periodically

3513.42 --> 3518.339
just bring that up again like you felt

3516.48 --> 3520.88
something

3518.339 --> 3520.88
is coming

3531.079 --> 3536.52
all right but if you're going to ask how

3533.46 --> 3541.14
many Fe are we losing well why don't you

3536.52 --> 3544.819
put compare that to how many non-fe we

3541.14 --> 3544.819
are all losing okay

3545.88 --> 3550.98
I think there's I think on average like

3549.18 --> 3553.68
Flat Earth there's

3550.98 --> 3556.38
tend to not die as much compared to

3553.68 --> 3559.46
non-flat earthers really and that makes

3556.38 --> 3559.46
perfect sense too

3559.92 --> 3565.559
because flat earthers will probably be

3562.98 --> 3567.059
more exploratory with health and

3565.559 --> 3569.3390000000004
Alternative Health

3567.059 --> 3573.059
which will give them a great

3569.339 --> 3575.48
Edge for survival in this period per

3573.059 --> 3575.48
default

3578.46 --> 3581.059
all right

3584.579 --> 3589.2200000000003
so I wouldn't worry too much about that

3586.799 --> 3589.22
turret

3590.16 --> 3596.46
I I mean I think that our numbers are

3592.559 --> 3598.6800000000003
growing more people young people are

3596.46 --> 3601.98
turning to Flat Earth that probably will

3598.68 --> 3604.74
become real flat earthers at some point

3601.98 --> 3607.88
then that we are losing what you could

3604.74 --> 3607.8799999999997
say is the Old Guard

3608.52 --> 3615.559
so

3611.28 --> 3615.559
I mean we're not gonna die out

3630.619 --> 3637.2000000000003
yeah traveler maybe a little too

3635.28 --> 3640.5
elaborate but maybe just rest in peace

3637.2 --> 3644.4199999999996
good servant I think yeah

3640.5 --> 3644.42
I think I'll change the title to that

3649.44 --> 3661.869
pretty much on my heart anyway

navigation

3702.48 --> 3711.079
oh I know Celestial navigation roughly I

3706.319 --> 3711.079
I don't know the celestial navigation

3715.14 --> 3720.42
but I mean yeah through the flatter of

3717.119 --> 3724.26
debates have been exposed to a lot of

3720.42 --> 3726.9
yeah dealings with with Celestial

3724.26 --> 3731.5400000000004
navigation and the sexton and all that

3726.9 --> 3731.54
so yeah I roughly know how that works

welcome to the Stream

3756.66 --> 3760.25
[Music]

3760.68 --> 3762.859
thank you

3782.28 --> 3789.02
oh wow you really have an active Channel

3786.0 --> 3789.02
still very small

3796.14 --> 3800.72
oh you have some interesting CGI support

3804.079 --> 3807.619
that's pretty cool

3812.46 --> 3818.299
I see two videos from three months ago

3815.16 --> 3821.339
with like a really interesting looking

3818.299 --> 3825.42
animation of

3821.339 --> 3828.96
what seems to be a 3D model of Earth

3825.42 --> 3831.599
of the map so is that somewhat is that

3828.96 --> 3833.579
like somebody's else's work that you've

3831.599 --> 3836.3590000000004
worked with or did you actually work

3833.579 --> 3836.3590000000004
with that yourself

3837.119 --> 3842.339
because I'm kind of looking for that

3839.46 --> 3845.2200000000003
sort of CGI capability I have so many

3842.339 --> 3847.619
ideas I've just tried to share with

3845.22 --> 3850.74
silly looking sketches

3847.619 --> 3854.46
well if I had like a good flexible 3D

3850.74 --> 3859.4599999999996
program for the map modeling

3854.46 --> 3859.46
I could be well a lot more clear

3874.859 --> 3879.29
or is it like Mercator man

3878.099 --> 3882.0
okay

3879.29 --> 3885.359
[Music]

3882.0 --> 3888.359
you want to do a live show together well

3885.359 --> 3891.119
I don't know if I'd be able to handle

3888.359 --> 3893.2799999999997
that really because it seems that you're

3891.119 --> 3895.2000000000003
not all that great in English although

3893.28 --> 3898.44
but that's still pretty good for

3895.2 --> 3900.18
Frenchmen but I don't know if that would

3898.44 --> 3903.2400000000002
work

3900.18 --> 3906.66
I I get kind of agitated

3903.24 --> 3909.4199999999996
I think I wouldn't be able to focus

3906.66 --> 3911.819
but dude uh

3909.42 --> 3917.579
contact me on Skype and

3911.819 --> 3920.88
and we can chat and exchange ideas and

3917.579 --> 3924.2400000000002
and videos and all that

3920.88 --> 3926.1600000000003
and then maybe after a while we could do

3924.24 --> 3928.2
a live show together

3926.16 --> 3932.04
but I'm usually not

3928.2 --> 3934.6189999999997
for just like oh hello let's do a live

3932.04 --> 3937.5
together just like that no first I want

3934.619 --> 3939.299
to get to know you a bit messenger

3937.5 --> 3941.819
Skype

3939.299 --> 3943.799
I mean it's in the link

3941.819 --> 3946.579
in the description box of the YouTube

3943.799 --> 3946.579
video below

3949.619 --> 3953.42
it's literally the first sentence

3959.84 --> 3970.319
[Music]

3966.26 --> 3973.1600000000003
right but yeah thanks for for popping by

3970.319 --> 3973.16
in the chatton

3976.619 --> 3979.2200000000003
huh

3989.539 --> 3995.78
right but yeah

3992.039 --> 3995.78
I think I'll probably just like

3998.28 --> 4004.46
watch one of these videos and see if I

4001.4 --> 4008.119
can like figure out

4004.46 --> 4010.42
because I I'm not good at French just so

4008.119 --> 4010.42
you know

4030.92 --> 4037.46
right but I'm gonna then just check out

4033.799 --> 4040.579
some of your videos first but yeah just

4037.46 --> 4044.119
contact me on Skype just add my email on

4040.579 --> 4045.26
Skype I'll add you back and we can keep

4044.119 --> 4048.46
track

4045.26 --> 4048.46
of each other there

4051.38 --> 4055.26
[Music]

4058.039 --> 4063.1400000000003
time passed we have not time for sleep

4060.5 --> 4064.4
well I do have time for sleep thank you

4063.14 --> 4069.0789999999997
very much

4064.4 --> 4069.079
I mean I've been at it since 2015.

4069.2 --> 4074.299
and uh

4071.059 --> 4076.039
yeah my sleepless nights concerning Flat

4074.299 --> 4079.059
Earth and all that are have been over

4076.039 --> 4079.059
for quite a while

4079.64 --> 4086.1189999999997
and to be fair so has technically a

4084.26 --> 4088.4
chunk of the enthusiasm that typically

4086.119 --> 4091.46
comes with that which especially at the

4088.4 --> 4097.839
start is quite exhilarating and do 2015

4091.46 --> 4097.839
16 even 17 were like really stunning

4099.739 --> 4104.178999999999
I mean it's not like that anymore now

4101.9 --> 4106.4
but it is like

4104.179 --> 4109.04
like starting with like

4106.4 --> 4112.58
a relationship with like a super hot

4109.04 --> 4115.04
super spirited smart girl like the first

4112.58 --> 4118.58
period that's what it was like with

4115.04 --> 4120.92
flattered it was freaking amazing

4118.58 --> 4123.759
I was like my mind was being blown

4120.92 --> 4123.759
continually

4126.02 --> 4132.02
it was just so unveiling to me because

4129.679 --> 4135.259
I'd been confronted with flatter things

4132.02 --> 4137.540000000001
and all that throughout my life and

4135.259 --> 4139.04
always kind of suppressed it out of fear

4137.54 --> 4141.56
that like

4139.04 --> 4144.199
if I break that open I'll never connect

4141.56 --> 4146.54
with anybody again and then Flat Earth

4144.199 --> 4150.259
happened on YouTube and that finally

4146.54 --> 4153.679
gave me the opportunity to just

4150.259 --> 4156.56
get that out of my system

4153.679 --> 4159.5
although it never really comes out but

4156.56 --> 4161.299
get like the loadedness of it out of my

4159.5 --> 4163.52
system

4161.299 --> 4165.859
and now it's all settled and now I get

4163.52 --> 4167.540000000001
it and I can teach flatter I can teach

4165.859 --> 4169.52
everything about it it's just not

4167.54 --> 4171.259
something that I like oh I gotta talk

4169.52 --> 4172.759
about flatter today

4171.259 --> 4175.12
I gotta do it

4172.759 --> 4175.12
because

4175.52 --> 4180.1990000000005
I just I'm not the type of person that's

4177.92 --> 4181.52
just gonna repeat myself over and over

4180.199 --> 4184.4
and over again

4181.52 --> 4187.400000000001
unless there is a specific reason

4184.4 --> 4190.099999999999
usually a person that would make it

4187.4 --> 4194.66
worth repeating

4190.1 --> 4197.54
right I don't just repeat to the world

4194.66 --> 4200.0
no somebody asks that's when I'm that's

4197.54 --> 4201.679
when I'm gonna give it rolling out the

4200.0 --> 4202.43
answer

4201.679 --> 4205.969
to them

4202.43 --> 4205.969
[Music]

4208.6 --> 4212.069
[Music]

4218.66 --> 4225.38
hey that one guy see you

4222.199 --> 4229.0599999999995
23 watching who

4225.38 --> 4229.06
oh man time is flying

4229.46 --> 4235.6
yeah but uh yeah a lot of people got on

4232.159 --> 4235.599999999999
board in 2017.

4238.159 --> 4243.82
in 2015 it was like the grand opening

4245.54 --> 4251.38
sergeant

4247.76 --> 4251.38
and Patricia stair

4252.08 --> 4258.34
and uh

4254.84 --> 4258.34
damn it the other guy

4259.159 --> 4263.9
of course yeah Eric Dubai but I think

4261.32 --> 4266.38
the Eric Dubai well was there even

4263.9 --> 4266.379999999999
longer

4268.48 --> 4273.799999999999
and of course I got this weird memory of

4271.1 --> 4276.02
having seen a video of his in 2012 when

4273.8 --> 4277.9400000000005
he wasn't even making videos yet

4276.02 --> 4280.219
and having

4277.94 --> 4282.44
physically touched

4280.219 --> 4284.179
the book he made

4282.44 --> 4287.12
[Music]

4284.179 --> 4291.38
the Atlantean conspiracy

4287.12 --> 4292.82
before it was even published

4291.38 --> 4294.26
like in 2000

4292.82 --> 4295.759999999999
2010

4294.26 --> 4298.34
I mean

4295.76 --> 4301.42
I've experienced some really weird

4298.34 --> 4301.42
things in my life

4301.58 --> 4307.96
that at the time I wasn't realizing how

4305.12 --> 4307.96
bizarre that was

4310.28 --> 4315.0199999999995
oh well in a way it did because there

4312.38 --> 4317.0
was this weird thing with that guy

4315.02 --> 4319.040000000001
who got that book and he said like no

4317.0 --> 4322.04
this is literally

4319.04 --> 4324.98
like from the future it doesn't make any

4322.04 --> 4327.679
sense but it works

4324.98 --> 4331.28
he was saying

4327.679 --> 4333.56
at the time and I still don't know what

4331.28 --> 4335.84
to think but he said that

4333.56 --> 4338.659000000001
through some algorithm

4335.84 --> 4340.46
I think it was a big cup Publishers

4338.659 --> 4343.639999999999
managed to

4340.46 --> 4347.179
basically publish the book

4343.64 --> 4348.8
before it's written

4347.179 --> 4351.86
yeah

4348.8 --> 4355.400000000001
yeah I know I know how that sounds like

4351.86 --> 4358.639999999999
dude what freaking science fiction movie

4355.4 --> 4361.099999999999
that I just tuned into right

4358.64 --> 4364.6
but it happened

4361.1 --> 4369.26
and I don't know how to explain it

4364.6 --> 4373.76
cause I had his book in my hands

4369.26 --> 4376.96
in 2010 and it makes no logical sense

4373.76 --> 4376.96
but it happened

4382.699 --> 4389.139999999999
influence back around 2015 Mark Sergeant

4385.699 --> 4389.139999999999
Patricia stare

4393.739 --> 4398.659
absolutely especially when they were

4396.02 --> 4399.56
together doing shows together that that

4398.659 --> 4402.37
was

4399.56 --> 4405.38
like best

4402.37 --> 4407.78
[Music]

4405.38 --> 4411.14
except when they got really creepy which

4407.78 --> 4413.12
also happened sometimes but most of it

4411.14 --> 4415.46
was just really great

4413.12 --> 4417.92
it really brought so many people

4415.46 --> 4418.94
together

4417.92 --> 4422.54
like

4418.94 --> 4423.98
it was like a live

4422.54 --> 4426.86
meet up

4423.98 --> 4429.139999999999
through the chat I mean so many flat

4426.86 --> 4430.58
earthers met each other through those

4429.14 --> 4433.280000000001
streams

4430.58 --> 4434.78
on Patricia stairs Channel

4433.28 --> 4436.88
when they did the show together with

4434.78 --> 4440.38
Mark Sergeant so many

4436.88 --> 4440.38
other hot potatoes that's right

4441.54 --> 4447.96
[Music]

4454.82 --> 4460.639999999999
because they were really

4457.82 --> 4464.78
not so much about the technicals

4460.64 --> 4466.64
but about society and psychology and

4464.78 --> 4468.44
sociology

4466.64 --> 4471.76
and

4468.44 --> 4471.759999999999
very good at it

4472.34 --> 4475.42
very interested

4477.679 --> 4485.84
right and besides most other people

4481.06 --> 4488.4800000000005
around that time 2015 and 16

4485.84 --> 4490.82
that we're talking about Flat Earth and

4488.48 --> 4493.36
trying to be technical it was all a mess

4490.82 --> 4497.84
I mean there was a lot of

4493.36 --> 4502.82
misassumption junk around on the flatter

4497.84 --> 4504.32
side in 2015 and 16 a lot of it

4502.82 --> 4507.259999999999
and

4504.32 --> 4510.199
like on the Flat Earth debates which is

4507.26 --> 4511.9400000000005
like highly Advanced by the way at this

4510.199 --> 4513.739
point technically with the arguments

4511.94 --> 4516.259999999999
it's highly Advanced the most advanced

4513.739 --> 4517.94
thing I've ever seen

4516.26 --> 4519.56
like the knowledge that passes through

4517.94 --> 4521.419999999999
there is like

4519.56 --> 4524.120000000001
Beyond

4521.42 --> 4526.219
beyond anything I've ever seen

4524.12 --> 4528.679
when it comes to like mechanical insight

4526.219 --> 4530.56
about these things it it surpasses my

4528.679 --> 4534.08
own like

4530.56 --> 4537.5
capacity in ways but I will always find

4534.08 --> 4539.48
like meta bridging data so I can always

4537.5 --> 4540.98
build with it no matter how complicated

4539.48 --> 4542.659
it gets because even if I don't

4540.98 --> 4544.699
understand it I'll still be able to

4542.659 --> 4547.0599999999995
understand that it exists and how it

4544.699 --> 4547.0599999999995
works

4547.34 --> 4553.85
yeah just like with programming I can't

4550.159 --> 4556.5199999999995
program but I know how it works

4553.85 --> 4558.92
[Music]

4556.52 --> 4561.92
but yeah the technical arguments have

4558.92 --> 4564.62
advanced greatly and now there's like

4561.92 --> 4566.78
flat earthers that make dumb arguments

4564.62 --> 4569.42
against Ballers and anti-flat earthers

4566.78 --> 4572.54
and when they do that we literally say

4569.42 --> 4575.719
why are you rolling out these 2015

4572.54 --> 4579.26
arguments like why are you arguing with

4575.719 --> 4583.04
him if the Horizon is too far

4579.26 --> 4587.179
which is a 2015 saying

4583.04 --> 4589.719
and there's so much more detail to it

4587.179 --> 4589.719
right

4591.8 --> 4596.900000000001
so back then arguments from Flat

4594.26 --> 4599.360000000001
earthers were kind of poor and the

4596.9 --> 4601.759999999999
Ballers were still like oh my God look

4599.36 --> 4603.259999999999
at this Flat Earth so stupid oh look at

4601.76 --> 4604.820000000001
how stupid their arguments are oh that

4603.26 --> 4607.04
you just don't understand the math oh

4604.82 --> 4609.139999999999
you need to go back to school oh

4607.04 --> 4611.84
and they were all squirting like oh

4609.14 --> 4614.360000000001
we're so intellectually Superior

4611.84 --> 4616.9400000000005
because our argument sucked

4614.36 --> 4619.159
but we were willing

4616.94 --> 4621.799999999999
and we were daring and that was like the

4619.159 --> 4624.5599999999995
first time where well Flat Earth came

4621.8 --> 4627.28
out of the closet in a more public way

4624.56 --> 4627.280000000001
like that

4627.739 --> 4631.78
yes tyrannical thought police

4634.28 --> 4638.12
right

4635.719 --> 4641.6
but yeah the Ballers can't be like that

4638.12 --> 4644.12
anymore with our modern updated

4641.6 --> 4647.120000000001
arguments they just can

4644.12 --> 4648.8
they just can't they only can guess like

4647.12 --> 4651.38
themselves

4648.8 --> 4655.219
how he died in his sleep

4651.38 --> 4658.84
we don't know yet how exactly

4655.219 --> 4658.84
I mean I just heard about it

4659.54 --> 4664.61
like right before this right before the

4662.6 --> 4667.71
show

4664.61 --> 4667.71
[Music]

4681.14 --> 4685.9400000000005
right just still there tall guy by the

4683.3 --> 4688.2390000000005
way I haven't seen you add me on Skype

4685.94 --> 4688.239
or anything

4690.199 --> 4697.339999999999
Stephen through good servant

4694.82 --> 4700.0
it's literally in the title lumpy gas in

4697.34 --> 4700.0
a vacuum hello

4716.44 --> 4719.639999999999
[Music]

4721.88 --> 4724.88
foreign

4727.74 --> 4731.09
[Music]

4741.98 --> 4745.178999999999
that Flat Earth

4745.82 --> 4750.32
goes through a similar archetypal

4747.92 --> 4754.52
Awakening well it's only logical I mean

4750.32 --> 4757.699
the puzzle that's been put into place

4754.52 --> 4762.02
to keep us under the globe

4757.699 --> 4762.86
is universal so the Awakening process to

4762.02 --> 4765.620000000001
that

4762.86 --> 4768.679
should also be Universal it's the same

4765.62 --> 4771.44
conclusions the same steps the same type

4768.679 --> 4775.28
of Awakening even

4771.44 --> 4777.62
maybe slight like more specific

4775.28 --> 4781.4
directions of interest for each

4777.62 --> 4783.86
individual but the way it's going to

4781.4 --> 4786.199
happen is going to be the same

4783.86 --> 4789.199
in the same order

4786.199 --> 4791.96
all that it's only logical because it's

4789.199 --> 4794.0
information all information

4791.96 --> 4796.46
is

4794.0 --> 4798.679
following the same structure it just

4796.46 --> 4802.4
does it's the akashic record it's how

4798.679 --> 4805.9
God designed it right no idea or

4802.4 --> 4805.9
realization is unique

4806.54 --> 4813.34
it's just about good timing

4809.48 --> 4813.339999999999
and useless timing

4815.21 --> 4819.619
[Music]

4819.92 --> 4822.7390000000005
yeah tyrannical thought police yeah no

4821.78 --> 4825.8
problem

4822.739 --> 4828.08
yeah I don't feel exactly great about it

4825.8 --> 4829.88
too I mean I kind of wanted to meet him

4828.08 --> 4832.1
at some point but that's never gonna

4829.88 --> 4834.88
happen now well not in the physical

4832.1 --> 4834.88
world anyway

4855.699 --> 4862.299999999999
it's right and let's see that's a it's

4858.44 --> 4862.299999999999
an interesting comparison yeah

4862.4 --> 4866.999
foreign

4863.77 --> 4866.999000000001
[Music]

4867.28 --> 4873.5

[Music]

4895.52 --> 4898.179
foreign

4902.239 --> 4906.159
yeah I know

4909.56 --> 4915.26
well they're already like older anyway

4912.8 --> 4916.76
so the kids are not little or anything

4915.26 --> 4919.780000000001
that that

4916.76 --> 4919.780000000001
does help

4919.82 --> 4923.139999999999
but yeah

4928.58 --> 4936.08
it's still gonna be pretty devastating I

4931.219 --> 4939.64
mean my mother died when I was 25 so

4936.08 --> 4939.64
that's still very young

4947.179 --> 4951.08
which by the way is kind of tough

4948.98 --> 4954.0199999999995
because well

4951.08 --> 4956.239
good servant's mother found him so his

4954.02 --> 4957.7390000000005
mother actually had left her son that's

4956.239 --> 4960.339999999999
terrible

4957.739 --> 4960.339999999999
for her

4965.84 --> 4970.96
although at least she has grandkids

4967.94 --> 4970.96
that's something

4980.06 --> 4984.679
weirdly enough that happened to my

4982.1 --> 4986.96
grandmother too my grandmother I lived

4984.679 --> 4990.1990000000005
my mother

4986.96 --> 4992.179
but then yeah after

4990.199 --> 4995.178999999999
I don't know like half a decade after

4992.179 --> 4998.83
that then she died too

4995.179 --> 5006.129
anyway I don't want to bum you all out

4998.83 --> 5006.129

good servant Stephen

5023.199 --> 5028.239
is American

5025.179 --> 5032.1
not a kiwi at all

5028.239 --> 5032.099999999999

5035.56 --> 5041.320000000001
not that Stephen yeah yeah I guess

5038.199 --> 5044.62
there's been a lot of Stevens I mean

5041.32 --> 5047.58
Rasta hat is also Stephen I guess I know

5044.62 --> 5047.58
a lot of Stevens

5069.76 --> 5074.5
no no that Stephen is actually doing

5073.06 --> 5076.3
fine

5074.5 --> 5080.26
he's still around

5076.3 --> 5083.320000000001
and I don't know he's just

5080.26 --> 5086.08
he's kind of moved on and away from Flat

5083.32 --> 5090.58
Earth it seems it seems that he just

5086.08 --> 5093.219
couldn't handle the Ruckus of it

5090.58 --> 5095.739
he longed for peace and besides I mean

5093.219 --> 5098.9800000000005
yeah he's living with his wife now and

5095.739 --> 5102.178999999999
little kid so maybe it's better for him

5098.98 --> 5102.178999999999
to just focus on that

5104.8 --> 5111.219
right that's but that's the

5107.86 --> 5115.5599999999995
only people can see

5111.219 --> 5115.56
from years ago who also got on my show

5125.62 --> 5130.5599999999995
all right tyrannical thought please yeah

5127.6 --> 5130.56
thanks for popping by

5141.28 --> 5145.8
he does not have a passport oh that

5143.5 --> 5145.8
sucks

5150.04 --> 5153.659
how is he invited

5155.08 --> 5157.62
you think

5157.96 --> 5162.659
maybe I can do it well I have a passport

5164.139 --> 5170.38
I have never been on a flight though

5167.62 --> 5172.239
since yeah since I was a baby

5170.38 --> 5174.400000000001
but I don't know is that even like

5172.239 --> 5176.678999999999
possible

5174.4 --> 5178.719
because I'm not gonna get any freaking

5176.679 --> 5181.179
vaxes or anything and I'm not gonna get

5178.719 --> 5182.7390000000005
a vax passport so is that even possible

5181.179 --> 5184.54
without that [ __ ] because I'm not gonna

5182.739 --> 5189.339999999999
be like oh yeah I'm going there and then

5184.54 --> 5191.92
halfway somewhere I'm like oh

5189.34 --> 5193.78
yeah you can't actually come here and

5191.92 --> 5198.4800000000005
then they just like drop me off

5193.78 --> 5198.48
somewhere or something like uh no

5202.42 --> 5206.82
right I don't want to run into that kind

5204.4 --> 5206.82
of [ __ ]

5211.51 --> 5214.819
[Music]

5215.739 --> 5220.239
right but anyway I probably wouldn't

5217.659 --> 5221.92
even need to get a flight because Munich

5220.239 --> 5223.659
is not that far away from the

5221.92 --> 5225.639
Netherlands it is of course much further

5223.659 --> 5228.879999999999
away from South Africa

5225.639 --> 5232.62
but I don't know

5228.88 --> 5232.62
I didn't get any invite

5246.04 --> 5252.58
maybe I'm not blonde enough I don't know

5249.159 --> 5254.159
I don't know the nature of this Meetup

5252.58 --> 5258.0599999999995
in Munich

5254.159 --> 5258.0599999999995
I mean what is that

5258.46 --> 5263.76
and also by the way my German is not

5261.34 --> 5263.76
that great

5265.78 --> 5270.099999999999
[Music]

5267.46 --> 5271.96
so happy you're still are you freaking

5270.1 --> 5274.679
kidding me

5271.96 --> 5274.679
dude

5281.28 --> 5286.96
no I I've made my statements pretty

5284.679 --> 5289.4800000000005
clear about how I stand on that it's

5286.96 --> 5290.38
like yeah I'm never ever gonna take that

5289.48 --> 5294.28
ever

5290.38 --> 5297.400000000001
and if through circumstances

5294.28 --> 5300.759999999999
because of my unvaccinated status I'm

5297.4 --> 5302.799999999999
forced into into like out of my house or

5300.76 --> 5305.26
something it's War

5302.8 --> 5306.9400000000005
right I'm not

5305.26 --> 5308.8
I'm not gonna take it under any

5306.94 --> 5312.46
circumstances

5308.8 --> 5314.8
and I literally fight to the death

5312.46 --> 5317.92
to avoid it

5314.8 --> 5321.820000000001
that's right I'd rather die

5317.92 --> 5324.28
than take a vax rather die and I mean it

5321.82 --> 5327.04
yeah and oh oh yeah you're gonna try it

5324.28 --> 5329.44
anyway well then I will kill you if you

5327.04 --> 5331.659
try to force that on me and I will

5329.44 --> 5334.78
finish you off and I've said that like

5331.659 --> 5336.879999999999
10 times in the last two years and I

5334.78 --> 5339.84
mean it and I think it's widely known

5336.88 --> 5339.84
that I mean it

5340.0 --> 5345.4
right but yeah that also makes my

5342.699 --> 5350.219
chances of actually getting anywhere

5345.4 --> 5350.219
outside of the country much slimmer

5351.52 --> 5357.179
so if I'm gonna be invited somewhere I

5354.04 --> 5357.179
want some guarantees

6406.619 --> 6412.0199999999995
think that everything I've talked about

6408.679 --> 6413.82
is just some random theatrics or

6412.02 --> 6416.159000000001
something

6413.82 --> 6420.239
what you think this is just random art

6416.159 --> 6422.699
when I get all passionate no it's not

6420.239 --> 6425.48
and that's what's so scary to those

6422.699 --> 6425.48
scumbags

6426.48 --> 6433.0199999999995
so take it serious

6428.82 --> 6437.599999999999
actually take it serious actually listen

6433.02 --> 6437.6
and think about the implications

6439.55 --> 6448.139
[Music]

6444.659 --> 6449.82
no lumpy gas that's just one player

6448.139 --> 6451.86
that's out in the open

6449.82 --> 6453.9
there's dozens of them

6451.86 --> 6455.88
and that's what they do they try to go

6453.9 --> 6458.638999999999
around the internet and just get people

6455.88 --> 6460.02
kicked off like a bunch of stazzy

6458.639 --> 6462.9800000000005
scumbags

6460.02 --> 6462.9800000000005
that's what they do

6463.679 --> 6469.82
and they might be paid for it I don't

6466.08 --> 6469.82
even know they might be

6470.65 --> 6474.66
[Music]

6472.38 --> 6481.17
foreign

6474.66 --> 6481.17
[Music]

6494.6 --> 6501.42
oh right I remember now tensor yes

6498.98 --> 6503.339999999999
but you're you've been you've been in

6501.42 --> 6505.32
pretty recent okay okay thank you for

6503.34 --> 6507.4800000000005
identifying

6505.32 --> 6509.04
sorry you might have just dropped it in

6507.48 --> 6512.36
a bit of a

6509.04 --> 6512.36
tense moment there

6513.0 --> 6517.58
I'm just kind of sick of people being

6515.94 --> 6520.44
sloppy

6517.58 --> 6522.54
I was always sick of that but now their

6520.44 --> 6525.5
sloppiness might actually just get me

6522.54 --> 6525.5
kicked off YouTube

6527.639 --> 6534.179
right I mean I'm still frustrated that

6531.36 --> 6535.679
just YouTube is just not doing what they

6534.179 --> 6539.54
said

6535.679 --> 6543.179
they're lying to me like digitally

6539.54 --> 6546.3
provably lying they said they'd restore

6543.179 --> 6548.6
the video it's not restored it's not

6546.3 --> 6548.6
there

6555.42 --> 6559.26
I mean I'll show it to you it's still

6558.36 --> 6562.759999999999
there

6559.26 --> 6562.76
that remark that thing

6573.84 --> 6580.52
it's still right there I'll prove it to

6576.54 --> 6580.5199999999995
you they're just lying

6581.159 --> 6587.699
they're lying or it's broken and they

6584.639 --> 6589.56
refuse to restore it

6587.699 --> 6592.099999999999
either way there's just something really

6589.56 --> 6592.1
wrong here

6592.38 --> 6594.86
right

6595.739 --> 6599.48
so here you go see

6601.08 --> 6605.159
thank you for your appeal we've

6603.179 --> 6609.0
determined that your content flatters

6605.159 --> 6611.159
early bird 100 or 1437 spunky nut wonky

6609.0 --> 6613.739
how does my mind work doesn't violate

6611.159 --> 6616.32
Community guidelines your content is now

6613.739 --> 6620.659
live and related strikes have been

6616.32 --> 6620.659
removed December 2nd

6624.48 --> 6628.86
it's not just special

6627.42 --> 6631.6990000000005
right

6628.86 --> 6631.699
so now

6632.76 --> 6637.280000000001
let's show you live videos

6640.38 --> 6642.92
oh

6643.02 --> 6649.139
look that's 1436.

6645.9 --> 6651.719
not 1437

6649.139 --> 6654.719
it's not restored

6651.719 --> 6659.1
and the strike bad like the

6654.719 --> 6664.82
non-streaming band only got lifted today

6659.1 --> 6664.820000000001
yeah so YouTube is just lying

6664.92 --> 6668.4800000000005
yeah let me show you again

6671.94 --> 6676.98

6673.92 --> 6680.46
oh there you go yeah yeah

6676.98 --> 6683.599999999999
thanks oh thanks for undoing that thing

6680.46 --> 6683.6
except you didn't

6684.06 --> 6688.1990000000005
it wasn't restored and the video is

6686.639 --> 6692.28
still not there

6688.199 --> 6695.58
so you're just lying to me you do

6692.28 --> 6698.46
or are you so broken that these kinds of

6695.58 --> 6701.54
things just happen

6698.46 --> 6701.54
that's what's going on

6702.119 --> 6708.599999999999
it looks there there is still one strike

6704.46 --> 6712.1
that's from like 43 years ago

6708.6 --> 6715.299
that was like episode 400 something

6712.1 --> 6715.299
[Music]

6723.239 --> 6726.239
foreign

6726.6 --> 6731.400000000001
get all your stuff on Rumble no I'm not

6728.76 --> 6734.159000000001
gonna go to rumble but I have actually

6731.4 --> 6736.08
uploaded it on Odyssey I recently

6734.159 --> 6739.5
synchronized my channel

6736.08 --> 6741.179
which took like two days

6739.5 --> 6743.04
because I got a lot of videos on my

6741.179 --> 6745.38
YouTube channel but yeah all my videos

6743.04 --> 6748.619
on my YouTube channel or at least most

6745.38 --> 6751.5
of them I think are now also to be found

6748.619 --> 6753.239
on Odyssey but it is basically a backup

6751.5 --> 6756.6
Channel

6753.239 --> 6759.32
so yeah if you here's the link to that

6756.6 --> 6759.320000000001
foreign

6762.239 --> 6768.48
hey oh by the way that episode spunky

6766.38 --> 6770.28
not wonky how does my mind work is

6768.48 --> 6773.0
actually

6770.28 --> 6773.0
present

6775.92 --> 6779.28
on

6777.84 --> 6783.26
Odyssey

6779.28 --> 6783.259999999999
what how did it do that

6785.94 --> 6788.36
what

6788.4 --> 6793.82
okay well the video is right there

6793.86 --> 6799.38
although I have no idea how it actually

6796.199 --> 6803.4
did that since it was transferring that

6799.38 --> 6806.34
when supposedly that it wasn't there

6803.4 --> 6808.739
okay but the video

6806.34 --> 6810.659000000001
in question is still on there if you

6808.739 --> 6812.879999999999
want to watch it back it's live so

6810.659 --> 6814.5599999999995
here's the link this is like the backup

6812.88 --> 6817.32
Channel I'm not gonna live stream

6814.56 --> 6820.26
through this channel so don't worry

6817.32 --> 6822.48
about that but if I work if my channel

6820.26 --> 6824.400000000001
for some disasters reason were to

6822.48 --> 6828.419999999999
completely disappear

6824.4 --> 6829.98
someday well most of my shows can be

6828.42 --> 6832.08
found here

6829.98 --> 6833.218999999999
so keep that in the backup link right

6832.08 --> 6834.96
and now I'm going to take a two minute

6833.219 --> 6835.9800000000005
break God the show has been going on

6834.96 --> 6837.719
forever

6835.98 --> 6840.86
but I am going to take a two-minute

6837.719 --> 6840.86
break be right back

6861.239 --> 6864.239
foreign

6914.1 --> 6916.9400000000005
foreign

6942.36 --> 6945.679
all the retards

6945.98 --> 6949.95
yeah I'm sorry psych bear about that it

6949.139 --> 6953.0
was just

6949.95 --> 6953.0
[Music]

6953.46 --> 6956.6
sorry about that

6957.06 --> 6962.639
yeah I hope you won't take it personal

6959.6 --> 6964.860000000001
it's just that

6962.639 --> 6967.32
it seemed a bit Reckless but I guess

6964.86 --> 6970.619
that you just didn't realize that I

6967.32 --> 6972.599999999999
didn't know it I only found out when it

6970.619 --> 6975.599999999999
happened last time because I got that

6972.6 --> 6977.46
strike when I literally didn't even talk

6975.6 --> 6980.34
about it

6977.46 --> 6982.08
right oh by the way YouTube never like

6980.34 --> 6985.139
pointed out

6982.08 --> 6988.199
oh it was that time stamp it was that no

6985.139 --> 6990.42
they just don't say they just give a

6988.199 --> 6994.5599999999995
generalized word about it

6990.42 --> 6995.88
they don't even say what exactly it was

6994.56 --> 6998.280000000001
so

6995.88 --> 7000.92
I'm just assuming it's because of what

6998.28 --> 7002.96
people said in chat and that I might

7000.92 --> 7006.26
have said like oh yeah or something

7002.96 --> 7008.6
right and then not addressed it but just

7006.26 --> 7012.08
like let it slip and maybe that is

7008.6 --> 7016.659000000001
sufficient enough now these days for

7012.08 --> 7016.659
stazzy to start striking you

7018.679 --> 7025.52
right so yeah but it is a thing I we

7023.3 --> 7028.28
can't talk about this anymore I mean we

7025.52 --> 7033.4400000000005
sure we can talk about medical things

7028.28 --> 7034.82
right just nothing related to that

7033.44 --> 7037.46
nothing

7034.82 --> 7039.92
it's all been said and done anyway like

7037.46 --> 7044.32
nothing nothing is needed to be said

7039.92 --> 7044.32
here in this chat about that ever again

7044.84 --> 7052.04
it's not needed we already know

7049.28 --> 7054.0199999999995
all of us

7052.04 --> 7057.26
I doubt there's anybody that's going to

7054.02 --> 7061.179
pop in there that doesn't know unless

7057.26 --> 7064.34
they're a fake young person or whatever

7061.179 --> 7067.34
just to pull it out of us just to set up

7064.34 --> 7070.04
us shut us shut us up again right just

7067.34 --> 7072.7390000000005
to shut us down

7070.04 --> 7075.32
so there's literally no more reason to

7072.739 --> 7078.459999999999
talk about that ever again I didn't mean

7075.32 --> 7078.46
it like ever again

7079.42 --> 7086.36
and maybe like in you even outside of my

7083.96 --> 7089.4800000000005
channel I almost say like just it's

7086.36 --> 7093.32
don't talk about it anymore

7089.48 --> 7094.58
I mean everybody that could be saved is

7093.32 --> 7097.82
saved

7094.58 --> 7099.619
Because by the way information is

7097.82 --> 7102.32
rolling out then the world is working

7099.619 --> 7104.54
right now

7102.32 --> 7106.82
there's no more point in trying to be

7104.54 --> 7109.219
alarmist about it

7106.82 --> 7111.679
because everybody that's left that could

7109.219 --> 7113.78
still fall for that I mean are they even

7111.679 --> 7116.5
worth saving

7113.78 --> 7116.5
really

7124.34 --> 7127.4800000000005
I mean yeah

7130.219 --> 7135.9800000000005
that which shall not be named right

7133.52 --> 7138.56
while not be named until the nurnberg

7135.98 --> 7141.44
trials are over at least you know

7138.56 --> 7144.9800000000005
once all the involved people are gonna

7141.44 --> 7148.098999999999
be in rotting in prison or executed

7144.98 --> 7150.86
right including the media people that

7148.099 --> 7152.599
are actually pulling this censorship

7150.86 --> 7154.88
tactic

7152.599 --> 7157.46
right yeah once that's over then we can

7154.88 --> 7159.56
all talk about it all day long say all

7157.46 --> 7162.199
the words all day

7159.56 --> 7165.38
and like like get Billboards about it

7162.199 --> 7167.9
and literally just walk around in parade

7165.38 --> 7170.0
just showing like hahaha we can say the

7167.9 --> 7172.159
truth yes nothing you could do about it

7170.0 --> 7174.199
was all true

7172.159 --> 7176.36
and it didn't work we are still here

7174.199 --> 7177.739
yeah we could do that then

7176.36 --> 7179.598999999999
then

7177.739 --> 7182.239
not now

7179.599 --> 7183.4400000000005
not now

7182.239 --> 7186.0199999999995
first

7183.44 --> 7188.54
we gotta win

7186.02 --> 7191.2390000000005
first they got to be arrested and

7188.54 --> 7195.699
subjected to neuron work trial

7191.239 --> 7195.699
and then we can talk about it again

7196.04 --> 7200.36
but until then just it's there's no more

7198.32 --> 7203.0
Point there's no more point in talking

7200.36 --> 7205.94
about anything about that which shall

7203.0 --> 7209.0
not be named any longer

7205.94 --> 7210.799999999999
change the subject for [ __ ] sake okay

7209.0 --> 7212.119
well I was actually going to round out

7210.8 --> 7214.9400000000005
the show

7212.119 --> 7217.04
but yeah I mean this subject I don't

7214.94 --> 7218.78
even know exactly based on the words

7217.04 --> 7219.619
that I'm talking about what I'm talking

7218.78 --> 7222.0199999999995
about

7219.619 --> 7224.92
and that's good because you still know

7222.02 --> 7224.92
what I'm talking about

7225.8 --> 7233.56
and if you don't then you probably are

7228.5 --> 7233.56
so new to my channel and everything that

7234.679 --> 7238.659
yeah you wouldn't need to know

7240.8 --> 7246.02
I mean

7243.44 --> 7248.0
let's say in 10 years or something if

7246.02 --> 7250.6990000000005
this is all still around all this stuff

7248.0 --> 7252.739
is going to kind of be boring to people

7250.699 --> 7254.119
because it's over then it's like yeah

7252.739 --> 7255.98
they're so excited about it but that's

7254.119 --> 7260.239
that's in the past

7255.98 --> 7263.659
right it's gonna be just like oh oh but

7260.239 --> 7265.218999999999
we went through the the Vietnam War and

7263.659 --> 7267.08
it was terrible when all this happened

7265.219 --> 7269.179
and that happened and it's like and then

7267.08 --> 7272.719
the youngsters are like yeah yeah

7269.179 --> 7274.6
Grandpa whatever it's in the past

7272.719 --> 7277.85
right that's going to happen

7274.6 --> 7277.85
[Music]

7291.02 --> 7295.119000000001
um now you can just bend that

7295.4 --> 7301.36
but thanks for spotting

7297.5 --> 7301.36
LSG I really appreciate that

7303.139 --> 7308.4800000000005
all right but yeah in 10 years us trying

7305.9 --> 7310.82
to oh we're trying to not talk about it

7308.48 --> 7314.0599999999995
I mean it's not gonna be super exciting

7310.82 --> 7315.199
to Future Generations until it starts

7314.06 --> 7317.96
happening again though because

7315.199 --> 7319.239
eventually it will you can't stop that

7317.96 --> 7323.54
right

7319.239 --> 7326.0599999999995
it's awake sleep wake sleep awake it's

7323.54 --> 7328.46
gonna keep happening generational it's

7326.06 --> 7330.56
gonna keep happening

7328.46 --> 7334.04
and we're now

7330.56 --> 7335.659000000001
going through another Hill

7334.04 --> 7338.239
when it's over we're all going to be

7335.659 --> 7340.28
like yay we won and then everybody's

7338.239 --> 7341.78
gonna slowly forget the newer generation

7340.28 --> 7343.94
are going to be really bored about it

7341.78 --> 7346.58
try to figure out their own new way then

7343.94 --> 7348.739
we're gonna go then then the dark ones

7346.58 --> 7352.28
come in and like oh oh they don't care

7348.739 --> 7354.218999999999
anymore oh let's repeat history and then

7352.28 --> 7357.139
oh there we go again

7354.219 --> 7359.0
yeah that's gonna keep happening

7357.139 --> 7361.9400000000005
forever

7359.0 --> 7363.679
not saying concerning this specific

7361.94 --> 7365.96
field

7363.679 --> 7368.599
right this field in which they're doing

7365.96 --> 7370.639
this right now in the last three years

7368.599 --> 7374.179
but

7370.639 --> 7377.179
there will be other fields there will be

7374.179 --> 7379.76
more we're gonna do it again be prepared

7377.179 --> 7382.099
it's never going to go away

7379.76 --> 7384.38
right

7382.099 --> 7387.619000000001
once you think you've fought your last

7384.38 --> 7389.84
battle that means it's over for you

7387.619 --> 7392.08
because out there it's never going to be

7389.84 --> 7392.08
over

7392.619 --> 7398.0
uh [ __ ] [ __ ] get the [ __ ] out of

7395.659 --> 7400.78
my chat piece of [ __ ]

7398.0 --> 7400.78
scumbag

7406.06 --> 7409.259
[Music]

7409.82 --> 7414.88
not taking it good

7411.98 --> 7414.879999999999
I know you wouldn't

7415.28 --> 7420.08
I just really had to slag give you just

7417.739 --> 7422.839999999999
this hard slap

7420.08 --> 7427.76
because you didn't realize it

7422.84 --> 7430.219
and yes I don't know it's okay I hope

7427.76 --> 7433.88
I'm not mad at you right now because you

7430.219 --> 7437.4800000000005
you get it you prove and you get it so

7433.88 --> 7439.159000000001
oh that's Mutual right anyway I think

7437.48 --> 7440.959999999999
I'm gonna round out the show but I

7439.159 --> 7443.32
almost don't want to when it's getting

7440.96 --> 7443.32
dark

7447.86 --> 7454.58
yeah thanks for coming everyone

7451.46 --> 7456.5
it's good to be back on YouTube

7454.58 --> 7459.98
it's great to have so many chat

7456.5 --> 7463.46
participants compared to D live

7459.98 --> 7465.5
Dell just went live yeah I noticed

7463.46 --> 7469.4
go on

7465.5 --> 7472.76
nah it's been over two hours and I kind

7469.4 --> 7474.86
of kind of step away and

7472.76 --> 7476.659000000001
it's good to be back on YouTube it is

7474.86 --> 7480.5
very different from

7476.659 --> 7483.32
from on D live in a way

7480.5 --> 7485.54
but yeah

7483.32 --> 7487.88
something happens again you know now

7485.54 --> 7490.28
hopefully everybody here knows now what

7487.88 --> 7492.92
to do right oh are we oh where is it

7490.28 --> 7496.4
going oh no did he stop

7492.92 --> 7499.099
first thing you do check my Twitter

7496.4 --> 7502.46
check the last comment on the last video

7499.099 --> 7506.3
on my channel to see what happened

7502.46 --> 7509.06
right and then it's very likely I'll put

7506.3 --> 7511.820000000001
a link in there like hi I got a

7509.06 --> 7514.159000000001
situation I'm live streaming on probably

7511.82 --> 7516.739
D live maybe another platform in the

7514.159 --> 7519.5599999999995
future but that's that's what you should

7516.739 --> 7521.659
do I'm not just gonna go away right

7519.56 --> 7523.400000000001
you're not gonna see me disappear

7521.659 --> 7525.86
without like

7523.4 --> 7527.9
well basically a message like oh [ __ ] I

7525.86 --> 7530.239
think he really died or something I

7527.9 --> 7532.339999999999
don't plan to anytime soon

7530.239 --> 7534.379999999999
right I think I'm gonna live a very long

7532.34 --> 7537.38
time but that's really the only reason

7534.38 --> 7540.46
why I would go away at this point

I'm not gonna go away

7541.52 --> 7546.26
