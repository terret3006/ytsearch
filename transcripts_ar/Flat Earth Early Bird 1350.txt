day

194.319 --> 201.04
it's been a beautiful month though i

196.959 --> 201.04
really cannot complain overall

204.799 --> 208.56
except for when it was so he hot that it

207.04 --> 210.319
was just like

208.56 --> 213.12
but even with that it

210.319 --> 215.28
it's been worse i mean i remember what

213.12 --> 217.28
is it now two years ago it was so hot a

215.28 --> 222.4
couple of times that it was just without

217.28 --> 222.4
a shirt and then even still overheat it

224.84 --> 228.959
uh

226.56 --> 228.959
anyway

234.879 --> 239.48
the rain this morning in the shire

247.36 --> 250.48000000000002
23 degrees

250.72 --> 253.72
okay

256.72 --> 261.519
according to the predictions it's even

259.04 --> 265.04
going to be like 27 again this friday

261.519 --> 265.04
and sunday 28th

265.199 --> 270.32
but also a bit of rain on saturday so

267.6 --> 272.56
we'll see what happens

270.32 --> 272.56
who

272.72 --> 276.40000000000003
see predictions for monday

275.28 --> 278.71999999999997
rain

276.4 --> 282.4
and lightning

278.72 --> 285.04
but also 27 degrees so yeah could be an

282.4 --> 288.96
interesting week

285.04 --> 288.96000000000004
hey terry 306 good to see you

290.08 --> 295.88
it's raining over there too

292.88 --> 295.88
huh

299.12 --> 301.44
oh

301.759 --> 306.40000000000003
camera

303.6 --> 306.40000000000003
glitchiness

306.96 --> 314.56
right so yeah

309.759 --> 314.56
i had to uh kind of order a new mouse

315.84 --> 319.28
over the internet

318.24 --> 322.0
because

319.28 --> 325.35999999999996
this one like the the actual there's

322.0 --> 328.56
something wrong with the laser sensor

325.36 --> 330.96000000000004
it's constantly like

328.56 --> 332.56
like it might be that i don't know

330.96 --> 334.96
there's something that's just not

332.56 --> 336.16
connecting anymore properly so it's like

334.96 --> 338.63899999999995
really

336.16 --> 340.40000000000003
really agitating now trying to get my

338.639 --> 342.24
mouse across the screen

340.4 --> 345.919
especially like when i move upwards a

342.24 --> 345.919
lot of the time it just doesn't do it

346.8 --> 350.479
so i'm ordering a new mouse

351.36 --> 356.47900000000004
and yeah english g

354.24 --> 358.88
his donation was very handy for that

356.479 --> 360.96
because i would not be normally be able

358.88 --> 364.4
to just

360.96 --> 364.4
have an expenditure like that

365.68 --> 369.68
that was perfect timing

367.759 --> 371.199
and hopefully the new mouse will solve

369.68 --> 373.44
the situation

371.199 --> 375.039
so i could just get back doing

373.44 --> 377.199
everything i do

375.039 --> 379.44
because when my mouse doesn't function

377.199 --> 382.72
it is really a chore

379.44 --> 386.24
and gets me very agitated

382.72 --> 389.759
so like this cannot do my keyboard's one

386.24 --> 394.24
thing but if my mouse is gonna start

389.759 --> 396.47900000000004
glitching that is just not doable

394.24 --> 396.479
hmm

397.759 --> 402.40000000000003
right so donate to my paypal i can

400.0 --> 403.52
definitely use it at lsg was very

402.4 --> 405.12
helpful

403.52 --> 409.31899999999996
anybody else out there that could help

405.12 --> 409.319
me out that would be great

410.08 --> 413.35999999999996
i mean

411.36 --> 415.68
my rent payment and everything is going

413.36 --> 417.36
to come up

415.68 --> 421.12
tomorrow and there's not going to be a

417.36 --> 421.12
lot left i can guarantee you that

421.52 --> 426.4
hey geoshifter good to see you happy

423.919 --> 426.4
wednesday

428.16 --> 431.03900000000004
is it wednesday

436.319 --> 442.72
why behind one month oh [ __ ]

440.4 --> 444.96
okay well i'm not gonna do that

442.72 --> 446.639
like i can't afford it like

444.96 --> 449.599
last time

446.639 --> 452.16
not even being behind with my rent was

449.599 --> 455.84
so much of a hassle with my landlord i'm

452.16 --> 455.84000000000003
never going to be behind on my red

460.4 --> 463.88
solar power

464.96 --> 467.28
hmm

474.16 --> 476.47900000000004
what

477.36 --> 482.96000000000004
the thunderstorm turned on the

480.16 --> 486.0
solar power collectors

482.96 --> 487.12
because of the lightning okay

486.0 --> 488.56
huh

487.12 --> 492.68
well there hasn't been any lightning

488.56 --> 492.68
storm passing by here

509.599 --> 513.52
oh yeah

510.72 --> 513.52
don't worry about it

519.039 --> 523.36
besides like

521.039 --> 525.76
there would probably be different ways

523.36 --> 528.08
in which you could assist me like with

525.76 --> 530.48
your computer skills

528.08 --> 532.88
if you were ever happy to come by here i

530.48 --> 534.48
mean there is stuff that kind of needs

532.88 --> 536.72
to be done

534.48 --> 536.72
that

536.8 --> 542.4799999999999
i feel like i don't want to tackle all

538.72 --> 542.48
that alone with my computer

543.92 --> 549.8389999999999
like trying to replace the uh

547.04 --> 549.8389999999999
the fan

550.64 --> 556.48
and all that

552.48 --> 559.9200000000001
and i need some like uh is it

556.48 --> 562.88
that paste stuff the connector paste

559.92 --> 566.399
anyway but yeah

562.88 --> 569.399
i'm fine for now

566.399 --> 569.399
uh

576.0 --> 580.16
my god it's so annoying that my mouse

578.24 --> 582.48
isn't working but yeah i ordered it this

580.16 --> 584.8
morning it should be there tomorrow

582.48 --> 587.6
and i can't wait because it's like it's

584.8 --> 587.5999999999999
literally just

588.32 --> 591.6800000000001
like

589.68 --> 594.0799999999999
like even when i'm just like doing my

591.68 --> 596.64
show and i'm not not in a moment of not

594.08 --> 599.839
really talking i move around with my

596.64 --> 602.0
mouse a lot to kind of like check things

599.839 --> 605.839
and now it's just constantly hampering

602.0 --> 605.839
super annoying

607.12 --> 610.64
so i really needed to do that

610.959 --> 614.88
and it will be exactly the same type of

613.2 --> 618.0
mouse i checked

614.88 --> 620.959
it's exactly this

618.0 --> 623.04
accepted new

620.959 --> 625.5189999999999
and with a wire

623.04 --> 628.079
god it's really hard to find

625.519 --> 628.9590000000001
my wired mouses

628.079 --> 633.04
now

628.959 --> 636.079
they're like outnumbered four to one

633.04 --> 639.279
am i close to amsterdam i'm in utrecht

636.079 --> 639.279
i'm always in utrecht

639.36 --> 642.16
geoshifter

643.76 --> 649.36
assume you tried cleaning the lens yeah

646.64 --> 650.079
it's not working and besides it doesn't

649.36 --> 652.9590000000001
look

650.079 --> 652.959
dirty at all

655.04 --> 661.12
i've tried everything like

657.2 --> 662.9590000000001
blowing into it even like just cleaning

661.12 --> 666.44
it out with the rolled up piece of paper

662.959 --> 666.4399999999999
it's not working

674.16 --> 679.4399999999999
what's happening here

676.88 --> 679.4399999999999
gods

687.76 --> 692.399
man i'm so glad i did just immediately

690.24 --> 694.72
order that i could not handle this

692.399 --> 696.24
another two days i swear it i could not

694.72 --> 699.279
handle this

696.24 --> 702.64
so annoying

699.279 --> 705.12
my mouse just isn't working properly

702.64 --> 705.12
anyway

705.2 --> 710.8000000000001
yeah yeah now there was a weird internet

706.959 --> 710.8
connection i had to reset it

712.079 --> 716.519
i have a few extra fans

716.72 --> 719.839
to be using okay

720.72 --> 722.9590000000001
what

723.68 --> 728.7199999999999
no look

726.24 --> 728.72
i got

728.88 --> 734.32
i don't yeah beside the mouse i don't

731.44 --> 736.24
really need any other equipment i have a

734.32 --> 739.2
fan for my computer

736.24 --> 740.8
it's just still on the other motherboard

739.2 --> 742.48
the old one

740.8 --> 743.5999999999999
and i don't have like the connector

742.48 --> 746.0
paste

743.6 --> 746.0
for it

749.76 --> 753.92
all right i'd have to like buy that

751.76 --> 756.56
separately but that's like insanely

753.92 --> 756.56
expensive

757.2 --> 762.639
when probably people that work with

759.839 --> 764.48
computers have just tubes of that stuff

762.639 --> 766.0
laying around

764.48 --> 769.88
excessively

766.0 --> 769.88
because it comes with everything

788.959 --> 792.079
not a hardware issue

792.24 --> 799.24
no it's it's more

794.48 --> 799.24
a confident confidence issue

800.16 --> 804.399
but then again it is kind of cooling off

802.48 --> 806.639
so i think that probably if it cooled

804.399 --> 811.56
off some little a little more

806.639 --> 811.5600000000001
i might just at some point go and do it

814.079 --> 818.2399999999999
but i still need the cooling paste

818.72 --> 822.76
load and overfist

831.04 --> 835.48
thermal paste

832.48 --> 835.48
yeah

863.199 --> 866.519
right anyway

870.48 --> 876.32
yeah i actually went to bed relatively

873.44 --> 876.32
late last night

879.279 --> 882.72
dad had a pretty good sleep

883.199 --> 890.3199999999999
but yeah just everything moved

887.6 --> 892.32
so i got up pretty late for my doing and

890.32 --> 896.839
went out for groceries and it was laid

892.32 --> 896.839
back and so everything is late

902.16 --> 907.519
i've never watched the channel called

904.639 --> 909.199
truth truth is stranger than fiction

907.519 --> 911.04
no

909.199 --> 913.9499999999999
i mean a channel that would literally

911.04 --> 916.079
call themselves that it seems like

913.95 --> 917.6800000000001
[Music]

916.079 --> 919.279
that i mean

917.68 --> 923.4399999999999
just try to

919.279 --> 923.4399999999999
youtube search on that there's no way

924.32 --> 929.6800000000001
because it's such a generalized phrase

927.199 --> 929.68
by now

936.8 --> 944.24
oh okay i looked on it and that

941.04 --> 947.24
immediately his channel came up

944.24 --> 947.24
okay

957.8 --> 964.4799999999999
ethereal the battle for heaven and earth

961.199 --> 964.4799999999999
oh my god really

964.56 --> 967.56
uh

979.839 --> 982.8800000000001
okay yeah i'm looking

981.92 --> 986.4799999999999
at it

982.88 --> 988.56
does seem to have plenty of videos

986.48 --> 991.5600000000001
seems like it's completely all over the

988.56 --> 991.56
place

1006.48 --> 1012.24
you will not get more than 40 pages

1009.759 --> 1012.24
really

1014.32 --> 1017.759
how is that being deleted isn't that

1016.56 --> 1022.5999999999999
just

1017.759 --> 1022.6
google rearranging their algorithms

1024.319 --> 1028.76
i would just say it's being deleted

1070.64 --> 1077.2800000000002
links you get is mainstream bs

1074.24 --> 1080.48
okay that well that sounds just like

1077.28 --> 1083.2
railroading then

1080.48 --> 1085.6
gear shifted that doesn't mean that

1083.2 --> 1086.64
the internet is being deleted it's just

1085.6 --> 1088.9599999999998
that

1086.64 --> 1091.2
it's being railroaded to the mainstream

1088.96 --> 1091.2
then

1092.88 --> 1098.4
i mean if you go to the websites

1096.48 --> 1100.64
and it's suddenly not there anymore now

1098.4 --> 1103.44
that would be something else

1100.64 --> 1108.44
but you not being able to find it in a

1103.44 --> 1108.44
search engine that's not the same thing

1113.6 --> 1118.08
no one will find it if it's not in

1115.84 --> 1120.24
search engines

1118.08 --> 1123.84
yeah unless somebody just gives you the

1120.24 --> 1123.84
very specific link

1124.88 --> 1128.0800000000002
yeah

1126.32 --> 1129.6789999999999
that's why you should always just do

1128.08 --> 1131.28
that

1129.679 --> 1134.0800000000002
i mean certain

1131.28 --> 1137.76
you know i don't even see search engines

1134.08 --> 1138.6399999999999
as a place to find new things

1137.76 --> 1141.44
no

1138.64 --> 1143.5200000000002
it's a database that can help you find

1141.44 --> 1145.8400000000001
the things that you're looking for

1143.52 --> 1147.28
specifically because you already know

1145.84 --> 1150.6399999999999
it's out there

1147.28 --> 1153.12
yeah it's like a find assist not a

1150.64 --> 1154.4
search for something completely new

1153.12 --> 1156.6399999999999
assist

1154.4 --> 1157.679
that's that's really not what google is

1156.64 --> 1160.0
for

1157.679 --> 1163.039
or the other searches to find something

1160.0 --> 1165.36
very specific then it can help you

1163.039 --> 1166.8799999999999
if you know what you're looking for if

1165.36 --> 1168.799
you're trying to find something you've

1166.88 --> 1170.48
never seen before

1168.799 --> 1175.559
don't know about yeah good luck with

1170.48 --> 1175.559
that that's been ruined since like 2010.

1178.08 --> 1184.96
i only ever use google if i want to find

1181.6 --> 1184.9599999999998
something very specific

1189.6 --> 1194.08
but every key fine every keyword then

1192.16 --> 1198.1200000000001
then maybe maybe they made it worse but

1194.08 --> 1198.12
it's always been terrible

1211.039 --> 1216.8799999999999
right and besides your shifter who the

1213.44 --> 1218.72
hell needs more than 30 or 40 pages of

1216.88 --> 1221.44
search results

1218.72 --> 1223.679
i mean do you really need the 40 pages

1221.44 --> 1226.0
of search results every time you do a

1223.679 --> 1226.0
search

1226.799 --> 1229.36
i don't

1229.84 --> 1235.4399999999998
i usually don't even go beyond the first

1232.84 --> 1237.76
page if it's just not there what i'm

1235.44 --> 1240.0
specifically looking for

1237.76 --> 1243.84
then

1240.0 --> 1243.84
i try to find it another way

1244.88 --> 1249.679
or yeah or it's yeah it's just usually

1247.52 --> 1251.679
just scrolling through the pages until

1249.679 --> 1255.48
you find the thing you know you're

1251.679 --> 1255.48
looking for specifically

1269.76 --> 1274.72
right okay yeah geoshifter i agree

1275.039 --> 1280.64
but that's that's your past time though

1277.679 --> 1282.5590000000002
that is just you browsing that's called

1280.64 --> 1285.919
browsing right

1282.559 --> 1288.84
so yeah the browsing function

1285.919 --> 1291.2800000000002
for search engine seems to have been

1288.84 --> 1294.08
severely degraded

1291.28 --> 1296.6399999999999
into mainstream railroading

1294.08 --> 1299.96
so propagandizing

1296.64 --> 1299.96
that sucks

1317.919 --> 1322.76
hello matthew hall

1319.52 --> 1322.76
see you

1354.88 --> 1357.88
right

1394.64 --> 1398.64
yeah i was going to say pgcnet they're

1396.799 --> 1400.6399999999999
not deleting the internet they're just

1398.64 --> 1403.8400000000001
making it harder to find things they're

1400.64 --> 1403.8400000000001
covering it up

1404.559 --> 1408.6399999999999
muddying the water railroading that's

1406.72 --> 1412.0
what it is it's terrible

1408.64 --> 1415.48
and it should definitely be reversed

1412.0 --> 1415.48
or replaced

1445.2 --> 1449.76
oh okay yeah well if they keep it up

1446.96 --> 1451.679
dealership this could i hope for them

1449.76 --> 1454.08
this is temporary

1451.679 --> 1455.3600000000001
because if it's not google if it's not

1454.08 --> 1459.84
temporary

1455.36 --> 1462.24
then your engine will be discarded

1459.84 --> 1464.9599999999998
oh you got all that investment all yeah

1462.24 --> 1467.44
it will be thrown in the bin with the

1464.96 --> 1467.44
trash

1468.159 --> 1471.44
so

1468.96 --> 1474.159
better take those stupid railroading

1471.44 --> 1476.24
restrictions off or people

1474.159 --> 1478.0800000000002
might just get in their mind hey maybe

1476.24 --> 1480.24
we can actually build

1478.08 --> 1482.799
a search engine that's like based on the

1480.24 --> 1485.279
old google system the algorithm of that

1482.799 --> 1488.1589999999999
i mean we can rip that from somewhere

1485.279 --> 1492.64
and then we just make like the ultimate

1488.159 --> 1497.7600000000002
best google that will never be degraded

1492.64 --> 1500.24
and then replace you right in your face

1497.76 --> 1503.039
yeah google how would you like your your

1500.24 --> 1505.679
prized search engine that you're

1503.039 --> 1507.6
utilizing as some kind of

1505.679 --> 1509.679
mule

1507.6 --> 1512.24
for sales

1509.679 --> 1515.52
how would you like that to be completely

1512.24 --> 1518.32
discarded and abandoned

1515.52 --> 1523.52
think that's a good idea

1518.32 --> 1523.52
i mean it's only extremely expensive

1523.76 --> 1530.96
so just stop this foolish idiotic

1527.919 --> 1534.24
corporate exploitation that's completely

1530.96 --> 1535.6000000000001
useless and nobody wants it

1534.24 --> 1537.84
yeah

1535.6 --> 1541.559
or you're gonna lose

1537.84 --> 1541.559
this prized horse

1566.0 --> 1571.36
right so yeah they're probably trying to

1568.559 --> 1573.6
this is like the corporate espionage

1571.36 --> 1575.6789999999999
sabotage [ __ ]

1573.6 --> 1578.32
i mean if all the other search engines

1575.679 --> 1581.3600000000001
are now all leaning on google then

1578.32 --> 1583.279
google is simply just exerting monopoly

1581.36 --> 1585.84
guild power

1583.279 --> 1587.76
they're like oh oh so you're all now

1585.84 --> 1590.24
based on us huh

1587.76 --> 1592.799
okay well then we're literally going to

1590.24 --> 1595.039
destroy it

1592.799 --> 1598.24
you leaned on us and now we're gonna

1595.039 --> 1601.2
like make like put the shackles on you

1598.24 --> 1602.08
and now you are literally going to serve

1601.2 --> 1604.48
our

1602.08 --> 1608.32
corporate interests

1604.48 --> 1608.32
because you all leaned on us

1609.36 --> 1613.84
so that might be it right maybe

1611.279 --> 1616.559
duckduckgo just need to get his

1613.84 --> 1620.9189999999999
head out of its ass and starts being its

1616.559 --> 1620.9189999999999
own freaking algorithm again

1633.52 --> 1637.0
hey good servant

1662.799 --> 1667.32
huh i have no idea elise

1674.559 --> 1681.559
i am not too familiar with typical

1677.6 --> 1681.559
library protocols

1682.88 --> 1687.64
as i like never go to a library

1707.919 --> 1710.919
hmm

1729.12 --> 1734.32
right but anyway yeah look guys i can't

1731.679 --> 1737.44
technically attest to it because

1734.32 --> 1738.8799999999999
well on my show every morning or

1737.44 --> 1741.8400000000001
afternoon for me

1738.88 --> 1743.2
i do literally type into google the word

1741.84 --> 1744.399
temperature

1743.2 --> 1748.559
in order to

1744.399 --> 1749.36
search the temperature and you know what

1748.559 --> 1751.76
now

1749.36 --> 1754.399
it doesn't even give me a standard

1751.76 --> 1757.52
temperature read out as the first result

1754.399 --> 1759.6
it's always trying to make me click some

1757.52 --> 1761.2
ad link first

1759.6 --> 1763.9189999999999
every time

1761.2 --> 1766.799
every single time now

1763.919 --> 1768.5590000000002
so it's it's become like an aging ad bot

1766.799 --> 1771.279
it's terrible

1768.559 --> 1774.559
it's extremely self-destructive that

1771.279 --> 1777.559
they've engaged to do this extremely

1774.559 --> 1777.559
self-destructive

1781.84 --> 1783.6
so

1782.72 --> 1784.72
yeah

1783.6 --> 1786.8799999999999
undo it

1784.72 --> 1789.039
and do it google and do it or you're

1786.88 --> 1794.279
literally going to end up destroying

1789.039 --> 1794.279
yourself for no [ __ ] reason

1794.32 --> 1797.799
undo it

1810.559 --> 1816.0
yeah and i highly recommend like other

1813.2 --> 1819.3600000000001
search engine builders out there

1816.0 --> 1821.679
to just [ __ ] google like screw them oh

1819.36 --> 1824.24
they're better they always are ahead of

1821.679 --> 1826.799
yeah who gives a [ __ ]

1824.24 --> 1829.2
if they're always ahead of you nobody

1826.799 --> 1830.0
gives a [ __ ] if they're always ahead of

1829.2 --> 1834.0800000000002
you

1830.0 --> 1835.679
just do your own algorithm build your

1834.08 --> 1838.799
thing

1835.679 --> 1842.5590000000002
so that it's separate separate code if

1838.799 --> 1846.48
it's separate code and they corrupt then

1842.559 --> 1848.84
you don't automatically corrupt this is

1846.48 --> 1850.559
rudimentary

1848.84 --> 1852.9599999999998
people

1850.559 --> 1856.6399999999999
rudimentary

1852.96 --> 1860.64
get your own search algorithms

1856.64 --> 1863.64
build them separately

1860.64 --> 1863.64
separately

1866.24 --> 1873.1200000000001
it doesn't matter if some other one is

1870.399 --> 1874.6399999999999
better it doesn't matter it only matters

1873.12 --> 1878.4799999999998
is that yours

1874.64 --> 1882.7990000000002
functions separately

1878.48 --> 1882.799
that's the only thing that matters now

1890.0 --> 1893.84
smartphone operating wow

1899.279 --> 1905.039
okay well i don't use smartphone so

1901.76 --> 1907.84
that's not my problem

1905.039 --> 1907.84
literally

1914.32 --> 1917.9189999999999
google on youtube yeah that's all very

1916.159 --> 1920.5590000000002
cute

1917.919 --> 1922.88
i don't care

1920.559 --> 1925.2
i mean as you as long as youtube just

1922.88 --> 1927.6000000000001
functions

1925.2 --> 1929.799
it's all good

1927.6 --> 1933.12
i mean i was never gonna be

1929.799 --> 1935.679
prioritized put on the priority fame

1933.12 --> 1938.9599999999998
list or whatever i don't give a [ __ ]

1935.679 --> 1941.76
as long as it just functions

1938.96 --> 1944.76
no more update [ __ ] no more

1941.76 --> 1944.76
corporatization

1946.08 --> 1949.799
no more railroading

1954.399 --> 1961.32
just let us do what we want to do that's

1957.84 --> 1961.32
why it's youtube

1996.799 --> 2004.32
so can we move on now to a less

1999.44 --> 2007.039
horrifically miserable subject

2004.32 --> 2009.2
as oh look everything we use is

2007.039 --> 2012.1589999999999
corrupting right under our noses so can

2009.2 --> 2013.919
we now have a less miserable subject

2012.159 --> 2017.279
where we can actually

2013.919 --> 2019.8400000000001
do something about it other than moping

2017.279 --> 2021.6
and being miserable and spreading that

2019.84 --> 2024.6
misery to others

2021.6 --> 2024.6
okay

2048.72 --> 2054.0
or pile on some more [ __ ] guys

2051.679 --> 2056.96
why don't you pile on some more misery

2054.0 --> 2058.48
be just go ahead

2056.96 --> 2060.2400000000002
just tell us

2058.48 --> 2061.919
why don't you add on to it how they're

2060.24 --> 2063.1189999999997
all [ __ ] psychopaths and they

2061.919 --> 2065.919
literally have

2063.119 --> 2067.679
contracts with the devil on our souls

2065.919 --> 2069.919
why don't you just go there then why

2067.679 --> 2072.919
don't you make it more [ __ ] miserable

2069.919 --> 2072.919
then

2079.919 --> 2083.2799999999997
give us a good topic

2087.76 --> 2090.159
um

2093.599 --> 2098.639
i don't know

2095.919 --> 2098.6389999999997
about what

2099.2 --> 2103.7599999999998
ether how is that a good conversation

2102.48 --> 2105.839
i mean

2103.76 --> 2109.599
everything i could say about ether i've

2105.839 --> 2112.24
already done like 20 times by now so

2109.599 --> 2114.48
it's an aberration

2112.24 --> 2116.7999999999997
people will believe it just like gravity

2114.48 --> 2118.8
and they will dwell around it

2116.8 --> 2121.52
not wanting to recognize that they're

2118.8 --> 2126.32
actually not delivering any proof it's

2121.52 --> 2126.32
just a giant pile of correlations

2126.64 --> 2130.56
that's it

2128.16 --> 2135.04
there's no even actual connection within

2130.56 --> 2135.04
a some kind of phenomenon so that's it

2140.4 --> 2145.839
send you the t-shirt tracking number

2142.4 --> 2145.839
later oh okay

2146.48 --> 2149.44
oh

2147.359 --> 2152.4
so it just got on the mail because i was

2149.44 --> 2155.359
kind of waiting for it to arrive already

2152.4 --> 2155.359
steamy traveler

2157.04 --> 2160.839
looking forward to that

2181.44 --> 2186.4
right yeah flatter sage and look the

2184.079 --> 2188.0
whole ether [ __ ]

2186.4 --> 2190.96
at some point there's going to be like

2188.0 --> 2194.72
anti-etherists ethereans they're going

2190.96 --> 2194.7200000000003
to be just like anti-flat earthers

2196.24 --> 2198.72
and they

2198.839 --> 2204.0789999999997
will just do what ballers do and

2201.92 --> 2205.92
constantly like ah but you just don't

2204.079 --> 2210.5600000000004
understand this in this correlation and

2205.92 --> 2212.88
they will just regurgitate that forever

2210.56 --> 2215.119
just like ballers regurgitated what

2212.88 --> 2217.04
about satellites in space

2215.119 --> 2219.839
and they will constantly yeah but what

2217.04 --> 2221.68
about the dielectric field and

2219.839 --> 2224.24
magnetism and

2221.68 --> 2226.0789999999997
constantly overlooking how it has been

2224.24 --> 2229.2799999999997
pointed out how that doesn't actually

2226.079 --> 2231.6800000000003
prove anything but they will repeat it

2229.28 --> 2235.52
anyway

2231.68 --> 2237.839
they will do it anyway for years

2235.52 --> 2240.24
years to come

2237.839 --> 2243.119
years

2240.24 --> 2247.7999999999997
so get ready for that whole another

2243.119 --> 2247.8
layer of troll idiots

2263.839 --> 2268.56
the artemis was scrub yeah so i heard

2266.48 --> 2271.56
that somebody told me that on my show

2268.56 --> 2271.56
yesterday

2277.76 --> 2281.599
hello oronacobumbo what are you talking

2279.68 --> 2285.0
about the wrong time no you got right in

2281.599 --> 2285.0
the right time

2363.04 --> 2368.88
okay

2364.64 --> 2373.7999999999997
you're gonna wash your car all right

2368.88 --> 2373.8
uh make it interesting i don't know

2385.52 --> 2390.8
i actually feel extremely aggressive

2387.68 --> 2393.7599999999998
today but not like frustrated that it

2390.8 --> 2395.8390000000004
has to burst forth it's just that

2393.76 --> 2398.48
in my mind as soon as it just like

2395.839 --> 2401.2
establish a thinking routine it's it

2398.48 --> 2403.359
gets aggressive quickly

2401.2 --> 2405.2799999999997
i'm just being really pissed off in

2403.359 --> 2408.0789999999997
general so that's why i'm not happy you

2405.28 --> 2411.079
guys whining about this stupid algorithm

2408.079 --> 2411.079
[ __ ]

2416.0 --> 2423.079
because i feel

2418.8 --> 2423.079
like executing politicians

2426.079 --> 2432.04
and corporation and banking heads alike

2438.24 --> 2443.1189999999997
or maybe we could just like

2440.96 --> 2445.359
gather them up on some cliff and then

2443.119 --> 2447.839
just drive them over the cliff with

2445.359 --> 2451.16
bulldozers or something

2447.839 --> 2451.16
i don't know

2456.0 --> 2461.319
but it's interesting how there have been

2458.319 --> 2461.319
echoes

2470.64 --> 2472.8799999999997
just

2473.359 --> 2476.56
that there seems to be a revolution at

2475.68 --> 2480.16
hand

2476.56 --> 2482.7999999999997
a very an actual one

2480.16 --> 2482.7999999999997
and i'm just

2484.0 --> 2488.96
kind of like

2486.079 --> 2488.96
ready for that

2489.04 --> 2493.68
so maybe at some point

2491.359 --> 2497.68
i will just not be having a show because

2493.68 --> 2497.68
i'll be like out for a week

2501.839 --> 2506.0
assisting some group somewhere

2506.64 --> 2509.839
but probably not

2512.24 --> 2518.64
and i don't think they really need me

2514.8 --> 2521.52
like for physical duties anyway

2518.64 --> 2523.68
i think that all just work out fine if i

2521.52 --> 2526.16
just stay here in this room and just do

2523.68 --> 2526.16
what i do

2530.56 --> 2534.44
elise that's gross

2545.599 --> 2551.839
artemis was apollo's twin sister

2549.52 --> 2551.839
okay

2567.52 --> 2570.72
right did anybody by the way pick up on

2569.52 --> 2575.119
that

2570.72 --> 2576.0
start off oh and benjamin from

2575.119 --> 2578.96
uh

2576.0 --> 2580.64
monday

2578.96 --> 2583.04
how we actually brought up the

2580.64 --> 2584.319
challenger how it was used literally to

2583.04 --> 2586.24
just

2584.319 --> 2589.119
make people stop being interested in

2586.24 --> 2592.68
moon landing exactly like i was talking

2589.119 --> 2592.6800000000003
about that day

2593.04 --> 2599.64
so anybody actually check that

2595.599 --> 2599.6400000000003
i mean it is kind of uncanny

2624.88 --> 2627.88
okay

2659.92 --> 2662.92
is

2667.839 --> 2671.44
yeah but

2668.8 --> 2675.28
look seeking star wars and all you guys

2671.44 --> 2678.4
like why is it so tough to do that well

2675.28 --> 2681.599
the problem isn't that

2678.4 --> 2684.079
they don't have the technology

2681.599 --> 2687.119
to basically build what they need to get

2684.079 --> 2691.76
there the problem is is that

2687.119 --> 2694.8
the technology has caught on too much

2691.76 --> 2696.0
for them to be able to get away with

2694.8 --> 2697.28
doing that

2696.0 --> 2698.88
like

2697.28 --> 2700.3190000000004
every time they say it destroyed the

2698.88 --> 2702.319
technology it's too painful to put it

2700.319 --> 2703.119
back to it what that literally means to

2702.319 --> 2706.079
me

2703.119 --> 2707.44
like i hear just a second voice

2706.079 --> 2709.92
that's just saying

2707.44 --> 2712.4
yeah it just doesn't work anymore we

2709.92 --> 2714.8
can't do that anymore

2712.4 --> 2717.599
we had a unique window of opportunity

2714.8 --> 2720.88
back then due to low resolution and the

2717.599 --> 2722.6400000000003
fresh new medium of television that was

2720.88 --> 2725.28
ragingly popular

2722.64 --> 2727.5989999999997
that allowed us to do this

2725.28 --> 2729.44
to the point where everybody was

2727.599 --> 2732.56
convinced enough to make it like a

2729.44 --> 2736.4
national pride thing

2732.56 --> 2738.0
we can't do that anymore technology

2736.4 --> 2741.599
and

2738.0 --> 2746.359
public knowledge have caught up too much

2741.599 --> 2746.3590000000004
for us to be able to get away with that

2751.359 --> 2757.359
right so now every time they try

2754.16 --> 2759.839
supposedly try say that they're trying

2757.359 --> 2763.2
they'll just have endless barrages of

2759.839 --> 2766.0789999999997
complications and issues and things that

2763.2 --> 2769.359
make it not able to work

2766.079 --> 2771.6800000000003
i mean the val allen belts

2769.359 --> 2773.44
i mean they might just be doing this

2771.68 --> 2775.359
whole thing

2773.44 --> 2777.28
with a couple of failures then send it

2775.359 --> 2780.0
up there just to like

2777.28 --> 2782.1600000000003
destroy the electronics because it got

2780.0 --> 2784.4
caught up in the van allen belt right

2782.16 --> 2787.5989999999997
because the van allen belt was only a

2784.4 --> 2788.56
theoretical response

2787.599 --> 2789.76
like

2788.56 --> 2792.4
literally

2789.76 --> 2796.1600000000003
there have never been actual

2792.4 --> 2798.0
tests or even physical interactions

2796.16 --> 2799.7599999999998
claimed

2798.0 --> 2801.68
see that's really the weird things oh

2799.76 --> 2805.76
the moon learner went through that yeah

2801.68 --> 2807.2
yeah but it's not even claimed

2805.76 --> 2809.119
okay

2807.2 --> 2810.8799999999997
so they might just like oh we're gonna

2809.119 --> 2812.56
do it now we're gonna now really go to

2810.88 --> 2815.599
the moon and then just send up the

2812.56 --> 2817.599
unmanned thing and then it goes just

2815.599 --> 2820.48
oh [ __ ] what happened we lost all

2817.599 --> 2822.6400000000003
contact oh no

2820.48 --> 2824.64
and then the conclusion will be all van

2822.64 --> 2827.7599999999998
allen radiation bill

2824.64 --> 2829.04
it shorted out all the electronics

2827.76 --> 2833.0400000000004
damn it

2829.04 --> 2833.04
so we really can't go then

2833.68 --> 2836.0
right

2838.079 --> 2840.48
i mean

2841.04 --> 2847.599
if i had been tasked

2844.64 --> 2850.64
to continuate the moon landing narrative

2847.599 --> 2850.6400000000003
that's what i would do

2851.04 --> 2855.2799999999997
she can't actually do the whole thing

2853.44 --> 2857.359
again as was

2855.28 --> 2858.7200000000003
there's so many new complications in the

2857.359 --> 2861.04
story

2858.72 --> 2862.24
it's basically already admitted to be

2861.04 --> 2863.52
fake

2862.24 --> 2865.68
but just

2863.52 --> 2867.7599999999998
not officially

2865.68 --> 2869.68
like

2867.76 --> 2871.44
they all kind of know it was faked and

2869.68 --> 2873.7599999999998
embarrassed about it but they just can't

2871.44 --> 2875.2000000000003
admit it

2873.76 --> 2877.0400000000004
right so if they're gonna do anything

2875.2 --> 2879.1189999999997
they're gonna have to build up slow and

2877.04 --> 2881.359
then eventually

2879.119 --> 2884.7200000000003
they're just gonna probably not do it

2881.359 --> 2887.04
because what what if they actually just

2884.72 --> 2888.5589999999997
put down an entire display of a moon

2887.04 --> 2890.319
landing

2888.559 --> 2892.6400000000003
and it was more high-tech than the

2890.319 --> 2894.72
original one

2892.64 --> 2896.0
and there still would be freaking

2894.72 --> 2898.839
problems

2896.0 --> 2902.4
and now it's the higher

2898.839 --> 2902.4
resolution problems

2902.8 --> 2907.44
and photoshop forensic analysis

2906.079 --> 2908.7200000000003
analytics

2907.44 --> 2910.88
etc

2908.72 --> 2910.8799999999997
so

2913.28 --> 2921.44
they just can't do it they can't do it

2918.079 --> 2922.8
they can't do it

2921.44 --> 2924.8
in the sense that they can't

2922.8 --> 2926.7200000000003
successfully fake it right when i say

2924.8 --> 2928.48
they can't do it

2926.72 --> 2930.48
of course they can't literally do it

2928.48 --> 2932.0
because the moon isn't even a place it's

2930.48 --> 2934.2400000000002
not a ball of dirt up there it's a

2932.0 --> 2936.4
hologram

2934.24 --> 2937.839
but

2936.4 --> 2941.52
they can't

2937.839 --> 2943.119
do it means they can't successfully fake

2941.52 --> 2945.52
it anymore

2943.119 --> 2950.119
and the progression of time is only

2945.52 --> 2950.119
gonna make that factor worse

2966.559 --> 2971.0400000000004
who runs the hologram

2969.119 --> 2973.28
the design

2971.04 --> 2976.079
it's there it's just there

2973.28 --> 2976.079
we don't know

2980.24 --> 2984.2799999999997
a sig star water yep

2995.92 --> 3001.28
i mean like what kind of a point is that

2998.24 --> 3005.52
who runs the holograms yeah who runs who

3001.28 --> 3009.119
runs the ball moon and over fist who

3005.52 --> 3011.44
runs the ball moon

3009.119 --> 3011.44
yeah

3011.599 --> 3017.76
why don't you answer that question ass

3015.68 --> 3020.319
what kind of a [ __ ] question is that

3017.76 --> 3024.1600000000003
who ruins that oh yeah who runs your

3020.319 --> 3027.599
ball moon then ando fist

3024.16 --> 3030.72
who who runs it see how stupid a

3027.599 --> 3030.7200000000003
question that really is

3031.92 --> 3034.96
who runs your moon

3035.04 --> 3040.4
andover fist why don't you answer me

3038.0 --> 3041.68
who runs your ball

3040.4 --> 3042.64
moon

3041.68 --> 3047.64
yeah

3042.64 --> 3047.64
see how much sense such a question makes

3065.92 --> 3069.839
take your silence as consent

3085.359 --> 3091.52
no neil degrasse tyson lies nasa is not

3088.72 --> 3094.24
gonna get the space story straight

3091.52 --> 3095.599
it's all a cluster [ __ ] cascade and

3094.24 --> 3097.72
they're all gonna go their own

3095.599 --> 3100.6400000000003
directions until they're so

3097.72 --> 3103.5989999999997
compartmentalized for such a long time

3100.64 --> 3106.64
that one space story narrative from one

3103.599 --> 3108.1600000000003
nation is going to be completely

3106.64 --> 3110.4
incompatible

3108.16 --> 3113.5989999999997
with the space story narrative of

3110.4 --> 3114.559
another nation that's what's gonna

3113.599 --> 3117.599
happen

3114.559 --> 3118.96
nasa cannot unify them

3117.599 --> 3121.92
yeah

3118.96 --> 3125.28
nasa can make it worse

3121.92 --> 3126.8
yeah nasa has been tasked to make it all

3125.28 --> 3129.8390000000004
gay

3126.8 --> 3134.2400000000002
to make it all gay and trans and

3129.839 --> 3136.72
communist and anti-human

3134.24 --> 3138.319
have you not noticed that

3136.72 --> 3140.3999999999996
have you not noticed that that's what

3138.319 --> 3142.5589999999997
they've done

3140.4 --> 3144.7200000000003
more than other groups

3142.559 --> 3147.7200000000003
more than the other supposed space

3144.72 --> 3147.72
agencies

3168.48 --> 3172.64
the hologram thing is pretty out there

3170.48 --> 3175.2
yeah it's also just true there is no

3172.64 --> 3178.0
physical thing there it's not an object

3175.2 --> 3178.0
shining a light

3178.8 --> 3182.96
it's not actually there arina kowambo

3181.52 --> 3185.28
how would you

3182.96 --> 3188.8
define

3185.28 --> 3191.599
that data that data that is there all

3188.8 --> 3194.6400000000003
put together how would you define

3191.599 --> 3196.2400000000002
a thing that everybody sees but it's not

3194.64 --> 3198.7999999999997
actually there

3196.24 --> 3200.9599999999996
you can't actually triangulate it if you

3198.8 --> 3204.1600000000003
approach it the angular size doesn't

3200.96 --> 3206.48
increase it moves away

3204.16 --> 3209.68
because it doesn't actually line up to

3206.48 --> 3211.92
an exact position what do you call that

3209.68 --> 3211.9199999999996
then

3217.76 --> 3222.6400000000003
the hologram is pretty far out oh yeah

3220.079 --> 3227.3590000000004
what would you call that then

3222.64 --> 3227.359
do you know a better word for it i don't

3227.52 --> 3232.079
hologram that's ridiculous oh really so

3229.92 --> 3233.839
what do you call it then

3232.079 --> 3237.28
huh

3233.839 --> 3239.2
some fantastical plasma thingy that of

3237.28 --> 3240.96
course isn't in literal position in

3239.2 --> 3242.72
literal space because that's the only

3240.96 --> 3245.28
thing you can imagine with your

3242.72 --> 3246.8799999999997
physicality assumption bias

3245.28 --> 3248.6400000000003
leading you

3246.88 --> 3252.1600000000003
yeah

3248.64 --> 3252.16
very easily disproven

3255.52 --> 3258.24
hey ajam

3261.44 --> 3264.839
good to see you

3275.68 --> 3281.04
what do you mean it moves away what do

3278.64 --> 3283.92
you mean you mean

3281.04 --> 3286.799
the [ __ ] you think i mean arinaka wumbo

3283.92 --> 3288.64
it moves away you go towards it

3286.799 --> 3289.839
yeah you see a moon

3288.64 --> 3292.48
you move

3289.839 --> 3295.2799999999997
through euclidean space towards the

3292.48 --> 3297.92
siding of the moon in a straight line

3295.28 --> 3299.52
guess what you keep moving oh the angle

3297.92 --> 3301.599
changed

3299.52 --> 3304.64
it's not there

3301.599 --> 3306.88
oh you're gonna change your angle too

3304.64 --> 3308.0
to try to follow the side of the world

3306.88 --> 3311.2000000000003
guess what

3308.0 --> 3313.359
it isn't anywhere

3311.2 --> 3315.68
you can never

3313.359 --> 3318.16
touch it you're never going to see an

3315.68 --> 3323.2799999999997
angular size increase

3318.16 --> 3323.2799999999997
as you try to virtually approach it

3324.079 --> 3328.48
that's what happens with holograms

3329.92 --> 3334.88
the non-local ones anyway

3332.559 --> 3336.3190000000004
you move they bend away

3334.88 --> 3339.04
because you can't approach they're

3336.319 --> 3341.599
always at the edge of vision that's how

3339.04 --> 3344.72
i used to say it remember that

3341.599 --> 3347.04
i said that in 2016

3344.72 --> 3349.839
at the edge of

3347.04 --> 3353.359
vision

3349.839 --> 3355.119
which is a pure descriptory way

3353.359 --> 3357.359
to describe it

3355.119 --> 3357.359
it's

3357.599 --> 3360.319
it's what it is

3360.4 --> 3363.839
at the edge of vision persistently being

3363.04 --> 3365.839
there

3363.839 --> 3367.7599999999998
is another way of saying non-local

3365.839 --> 3369.7599999999998
hologram it's something you can never

3367.76 --> 3373.92
approach but it is there

3369.76 --> 3375.5200000000004
visually it's just not physically there

3373.92 --> 3379.2000000000003
holographic

3375.52 --> 3379.2
a non-local hologram

3384.16 --> 3389.799
youtuber no it isn't iron uncle wumble

3386.559 --> 3389.799
you numpty

3391.119 --> 3394.119
ugh

3409.359 --> 3414.4
it doesn't matter if it's that far away

3411.76 --> 3417.76
if it's a little object in euclidean

3414.4 --> 3419.44
space even at that distance you can move

3417.76 --> 3423.92
towards it

3419.44 --> 3425.04
and measure an angular in sizing size

3423.92 --> 3427.76
increase

3425.04 --> 3429.2
which should be absolutely permanent and

3427.76 --> 3431.5200000000004
persistent

3429.2 --> 3432.8799999999997
that should always happen every single

3431.52 --> 3438.16
time because

3432.88 --> 3438.1600000000003
you allege that it is an object in space

3438.319 --> 3443.119
well nobody's ever seen that happen

3441.28 --> 3445.44
also the moon just

3443.119 --> 3448.6400000000003
disappears when it touches the horizon

3445.44 --> 3452.079
yeah and it disappears for three days

3448.64 --> 3454.799
also on a monthly basis oh yes of course

3452.079 --> 3457.04
all super persistent and

3454.799 --> 3459.52
consistent with a physical object

3457.04 --> 3461.68
floating in euclidean space yes of

3459.52 --> 3464.72
course

3461.68 --> 3467.7599999999998
we disagree oh yes of course we disagree

3464.72 --> 3470.24
so that makes my complete insanity all

3467.76 --> 3473.119
right he just can't ignore me now

3470.24 --> 3475.4399999999996
because we disagree so now my points

3473.119 --> 3478.1600000000003
that i'm making don't make any sense so

3475.44 --> 3480.7200000000003
you can just ignore it now and keep

3478.16 --> 3485.24
asking the same questions

3480.72 --> 3485.24
like a typical baller or an akuma

3499.599 --> 3505.28
no they don't sorry yeah sorry

3502.559 --> 3507.92
sorry indeed

3505.28 --> 3507.92
take five

3515.2 --> 3519.9199999999996
you can take the [ __ ] off

3527.44 --> 3531.2400000000002
and so can you

3542.319 --> 3547.079
nobody's gonna respond to anything i say

3545.839 --> 3550.319
and just

3547.079 --> 3552.7200000000003
reiterate your stupid conditioning that

3550.319 --> 3555.44
can you could just [ __ ] off

3552.72 --> 3558.5589999999997
and then include you orinaco wombo with

3555.44 --> 3560.559
your wrench that i can very easily take

3558.559 --> 3563.44
away from you

3560.559 --> 3565.6800000000003
yeah because it's not about you

3563.44 --> 3570.88
not speaking up for the globe it's about

3565.68 --> 3572.8799999999997
you holding on to the provable [ __ ]

3570.88 --> 3574.96
that's the part that's the part that

3572.88 --> 3577.04
makes you lose is the wrench yeah that

3574.96 --> 3579.44
that's what does it

3577.04 --> 3582.4
it's not about you wanting the globe or

3579.44 --> 3583.319
liking it or being into that it's about

3582.4 --> 3586.799
you

3583.319 --> 3589.119
reiterating the utter horseshit that

3586.799 --> 3590.96
comes out of anti-flat earthers that's

3589.119 --> 3593.359
the part that will make you lose the

3590.96 --> 3593.359
wrench

3596.64 --> 3600.7599999999998
you still got it for now

3610.74 --> 3613.81
[Music]

3629.04 --> 3635.72
yeah seeking star wars right now

3631.92 --> 3635.7200000000003
it's one of those days

3648.319 --> 3652.48
just

3649.68 --> 3652.48
don't get it

3655.28 --> 3660.96
i don't understand

3658.0 --> 3663.76
what's happened

3660.96 --> 3668.359
i think like one of the

3663.76 --> 3668.3590000000004
lens thingies might just be broken

3670.48 --> 3675.119
or displaced

3672.88 --> 3677.28
i don't know what's going on it looks

3675.119 --> 3680.92
different anyway i'm getting a new one

3677.28 --> 3680.92
tomorrow so

3684.88 --> 3689.52
globals are plain evil no they are plain

3687.52 --> 3692.079
ignorant

3689.52 --> 3695.2
and they're very vulnerable to evil

3692.079 --> 3696.96
because of their evacuation because in

3695.2 --> 3700.319
that evacuation

3696.96 --> 3703.359
evil can manifest in its place

3700.319 --> 3704.72
it doesn't always do that

3703.359 --> 3707.119
right

3704.72 --> 3709.2
there's no evil without evacuation and

3707.119 --> 3712.88
they got plenty of evacuation that

3709.2 --> 3714.64
doesn't guarantee evil though

3712.88 --> 3717.28
my current thoughts on quantum physics

3714.64 --> 3717.2799999999997
what about it

3724.799 --> 3728.4
i mean

3725.68 --> 3730.0
that's like asking what is your current

3728.4 --> 3731.52
thoughts on

3730.0 --> 3732.76
mathematics

3731.52 --> 3734.88
like uh

3732.76 --> 3737.28
[Music]

3734.88 --> 3738.96
that's quite a bit

3737.28 --> 3741.3590000000004
quantum mechanics is

3738.96 --> 3743.44
extremely vast it's so fast that i

3741.359 --> 3746.24
cannot oversee it

3743.44 --> 3748.559
it's that fast but i do know what it is

3746.24 --> 3751.7599999999998
and what they're doing and i also know

3748.559 --> 3754.559
where they probably made mistakes

3751.76 --> 3757.28
not mistakes as in the outcome

3754.559 --> 3758.6400000000003
is incorrect of the data they got from

3757.28 --> 3760.599
their tests

3758.64 --> 3762.72
it's just that they're modeling

3760.599 --> 3764.1600000000003
presuppositions that they sometimes

3762.72 --> 3767.2799999999997
utilize

3764.16 --> 3770.0
is in my opinion incorrect

3767.28 --> 3772.96
and there might have been some

3770.0 --> 3776.4
weird little presuppositional based

3772.96 --> 3779.839
trixies going on

3776.4 --> 3781.6800000000003
like the whole quantum delayed choice

3779.839 --> 3784.799
experiment

3781.68 --> 3788.0789999999997
that thing makes abso [ __ ] lutely no

3784.799 --> 3789.28
sense by any measure like it does not

3788.079 --> 3792.4
make sense

3789.28 --> 3794.3190000000004
like at all nothing about it makes sense

3792.4 --> 3796.319
it's not even quantum to me it just

3794.319 --> 3797.599
doesn't make sense it seems like a

3796.319 --> 3799.839
freaking

3797.599 --> 3803.44
cavendish test

3799.839 --> 3805.44
that's even more complicated

3803.44 --> 3807.28
that's what it seems like to me and yeah

3805.44 --> 3809.76
they might have put it all down in

3807.28 --> 3812.48
proper scientific terms but it just

3809.76 --> 3814.3190000000004
doesn't make any sense nothing about it

3812.48 --> 3818.4
makes sense

3814.319 --> 3821.599
it seems like a weird little trick

3818.4 --> 3821.599
it makes no sense

3822.079 --> 3828.079
and like the conclusions they've drawn

3824.559 --> 3829.6800000000003
from it are just weird aberrant

3828.079 --> 3832.7200000000003
philosophical

3829.68 --> 3832.72
weirdness it's just

3833.2 --> 3839.52
so yeah there's a whole bunch of quantum

3835.359 --> 3841.68
mechanical research quantum physics

3839.52 --> 3843.839
they're really interesting and very

3841.68 --> 3846.24
valuable i mean quantum mechanics has

3843.839 --> 3848.72
yielded a lot of knowledge about entropy

3846.24 --> 3851.0389999999998
in general a lot

3848.72 --> 3853.839
very valuable

3851.039 --> 3853.8390000000004
but there are things

3854.48 --> 3858.0
that they've done

3856.319 --> 3860.48
like

3858.0 --> 3862.319
also by the consequence of einstein and

3860.48 --> 3863.44
all that like assuming light is a

3862.319 --> 3866.24
particle

3863.44 --> 3869.28
yeah the entirety of quantum mechanics

3866.24 --> 3871.839
assumes exclusively that light

3869.28 --> 3873.92
is a particle

3871.839 --> 3876.16
it's a quanta

3873.92 --> 3877.76
but they assume specifically like it's a

3876.16 --> 3880.5589999999997
particle

3877.76 --> 3883.119
within like their entire framework

3880.559 --> 3884.96
pretty much where light becomes involved

3883.119 --> 3886.0
in the experiments

3884.96 --> 3889.839
and that

3886.0 --> 3889.839
is just incorrect

3889.92 --> 3896.64
so there is like

3892.24 --> 3899.1189999999997
improvement probably that could be done

3896.64 --> 3900.64
with quantum mechanics but purely

3899.119 --> 3902.7200000000003
through understanding i mean they

3900.64 --> 3905.44
probably wouldn't even have to be done

3902.72 --> 3907.1189999999997
any new tests or barely any

3905.44 --> 3909.52
the tests have already been done it's

3907.119 --> 3910.96
just the understanding of the tests need

3909.52 --> 3912.24
some

3910.96 --> 3915.039
revisiting

3912.24 --> 3915.0389999999998
in my opinion

3917.359 --> 3920.64
what is the phenome

3919.039 --> 3922.7990000000004
the phenom

3920.64 --> 3924.24
of the delay choice great spelling there

3922.799 --> 3926.559
your attention but yeah i don't even

3924.24 --> 3928.319
know what the phenomenon is

3926.559 --> 3931.799
in that thing i

3928.319 --> 3931.799
it's ridiculous

3941.839 --> 3945.599
a few weeks ago i said it was bullish

3944.0 --> 3949.96
yes yeah well that was probably a

3945.599 --> 3949.96
different context steamy traveler

3950.16 --> 3954.24
and by the way

3952.64 --> 3956.5589999999997
i yeah i never

3954.24 --> 3958.64
never said it like that what a weird

3956.559 --> 3959.599
thing why would you why would you say

3958.64 --> 3961.7599999999998
that

3959.599 --> 3964.1600000000003
steven why would you say that i say

3961.76 --> 3967.8390000000004
quantum mechanics is [ __ ] i don't

3964.16 --> 3967.839
say that not like that

3970.799 --> 3975.52
yeah

3972.24 --> 3978.3999999999996
what i was talking about is the

3975.52 --> 3978.4
quantum

3980.96 --> 3986.16
quantum like quantum mechanics

3983.68 --> 3988.16
quantum computing quantum

3986.16 --> 3990.319
the quantum thing

3988.16 --> 3993.2
it's a cultural thing that's the

3990.319 --> 3995.68
[ __ ] if something is called quantum

3993.2 --> 3998.96
according to computing [ __ ] it's

3995.68 --> 4000.48
[ __ ] trust me on this it's [ __ ]

3998.96 --> 4003.44
something quantum

4000.48 --> 4005.28
it's just a futuristic tech

4003.44 --> 4008.559
technobabble word

4005.28 --> 4008.559
that's how it's utilized

4009.28 --> 4015.28
if some technology is called quantum

4012.16 --> 4017.68
it's probably [ __ ] in the sense that

4015.28 --> 4020.559
it's just a really advanced piece of

4017.68 --> 4022.72
tech has nothing to do with quantum

4020.559 --> 4026.1600000000003
mechanics whatsoever

4022.72 --> 4027.5989999999997
other than just engineering design

4026.16 --> 4029.5989999999997
systems

4027.599 --> 4031.92
like faster chips

4029.599 --> 4035.2000000000003
it's not quantum

4031.92 --> 4037.44
that's nonsense

4035.2 --> 4040.0
that's what i was talking about i never

4037.44 --> 4041.599
said that quantum mechanics in on itself

4040.0 --> 4045.68
is all nonsense

4041.599 --> 4047.839
it just is utilizing really

4045.68 --> 4050.8799999999997
incorrect models

4047.839 --> 4053.52
but the data is the data the data is

4050.88 --> 4055.52
just what it is like it doesn't matter

4053.52 --> 4058.0
if they're

4055.52 --> 4059.68
if they're presupposed things that they

4058.0 --> 4061.68
were doing

4059.68 --> 4064.8799999999997
turn out to be something different that

4061.68 --> 4067.52
doesn't matter

4064.88 --> 4069.28
the data is the data

4067.52 --> 4071.28
the test

4069.28 --> 4072.48
and the data that comes out of it is

4071.28 --> 4074.799
just that

4072.48 --> 4077.68
it doesn't matter if the

4074.799 --> 4078.88
assumptions about what things are within

4077.68 --> 4081.1189999999997
the test

4078.88 --> 4085.88
are incorrect it doesn't matter the test

4081.119 --> 4085.88
is the test the results are the result

4102.88 --> 4108.08
some of them are possessed yeah yeah

4106.08 --> 4110.159
the glovers

4108.08 --> 4112.64
right well when you push them they go

4110.159 --> 4116.159
into like double speak mode that's when

4112.64 --> 4116.159000000001
they are definitely possessed

4117.44 --> 4121.2789999999995
thanks for clarifying you're welcome

4122.719 --> 4126.319
it's just that there are people out

4124.319 --> 4127.52
there that just say like oh it's all

4126.319 --> 4129.4400000000005
[ __ ]

4127.52 --> 4133.679
there's people out there that literally

4129.44 --> 4136.799
say that chemistry is [ __ ] okay

4133.679 --> 4141.359
deranged delusional idiots

4136.799 --> 4141.359
that are just gonna discard everything

4142.0 --> 4148.56
water is it is it's it's an

4144.839 --> 4150.799
element it's not actually a molecule

4148.56 --> 4154.319
like for [ __ ] sake

4150.799 --> 4154.319
for [ __ ] sake

4155.199 --> 4160.08
and that's just one example there's a

4157.279 --> 4161.359
whole bunch of hippie people idiots that

4160.08 --> 4163.12
are just like

4161.359 --> 4166.319
oh well

4163.12 --> 4169.44
there's been lies in these fields so

4166.319 --> 4170.400000000001
that means the entire field is incorrect

4169.44 --> 4173.04
then

4170.4 --> 4176.0
so we could just make up our own stupid

4173.04 --> 4178.239
fantastical [ __ ] like a bunch of

4176.0 --> 4179.759
[ __ ] hippies now

4178.239 --> 4181.599999999999
no thanks

4179.759 --> 4185.04
i'm not gonna be part of that hippie

4181.6 --> 4188.400000000001
[ __ ] yeah we already have enough

4185.04 --> 4192.4
[ __ ] delusion out there we don't need

4188.4 --> 4195.44
you to fabricate more delusion [ __ ]

4192.4 --> 4196.799999999999
in order to replace well-established

4195.44 --> 4201.239
tested

4196.8 --> 4201.2390000000005
structures that work

4203.6 --> 4208.4800000000005
yeah

4204.48 --> 4211.678999999999
you don't need to replace chemistry

4208.48 --> 4214.678999999999
because you feel like it

4211.679 --> 4214.679
ridiculous

4217.679 --> 4222.4800000000005
dejean had good research about what

4220.48 --> 4224.0
what are you talking about

4222.48 --> 4227.12
good servant

4224.0 --> 4229.84
the asian has had good ideas for sure

4227.12 --> 4233.12
wasn't it mostly

4229.84 --> 4233.12
yeah of course i remember him

4236.08 --> 4240.719
but his ideas were electrical

4238.719 --> 4242.64
has nothing to do with chemistry i'm

4240.719 --> 4244.4
mostly talking about people that just

4242.64 --> 4247.6
say things like

4244.4 --> 4250.239
water is an element it's not a molecule

4247.6 --> 4252.56
or then atoms are not real

4250.239 --> 4254.799999999999
what the [ __ ] is wrong with you people

4252.56 --> 4254.8
man

4254.88 --> 4262.08
they just think that they can just

4258.719 --> 4266.0
like they first used school

4262.08 --> 4269.679
and movies and cgi to have themselves

4266.0 --> 4271.76
inspired about the micro world and then

4269.679 --> 4273.679
instead of actually taking the lesson

4271.76 --> 4275.52
that was trying to be shared about it

4273.679 --> 4277.679
about hey this is how it works they

4275.52 --> 4280.8
discard how it works and then they just

4277.679 --> 4283.84
think oh well we saw it so we're just

4280.8 --> 4286.84
gonna make up our own stupid unproven

4283.84 --> 4286.84
[ __ ]

4292.32 --> 4297.679
that's happening out there

4294.4 --> 4299.599999999999
and that includes flat earthers who are

4297.679 --> 4302.56
horrible people

4299.6 --> 4304.08
i mean i rather have or like orinoco

4302.56 --> 4305.76
wombo

4304.08 --> 4307.76
ballers

4305.76 --> 4310.4800000000005
than people like that

4307.76 --> 4312.8
[ __ ] hippie idiots

4310.48 --> 4315.678999999999
that literally deny

4312.8 --> 4317.6
like structural foundations of reality

4315.679 --> 4319.36
that have been very empirically

4317.6 --> 4323.120000000001
validated

4319.36 --> 4325.04
those people can go to hell

4323.12 --> 4326.32
to hell

4325.04 --> 4329.44
burn

4326.32 --> 4332.96
burn liar

4329.44 --> 4335.199
you create this cohesion

4332.96 --> 4336.2390000000005
you destroy

4335.199 --> 4338.5599999999995
things

4336.239 --> 4340.4
and you have only [ __ ] [ __ ] to

4338.56 --> 4343.400000000001
replace it with that doesn't yield

4340.4 --> 4343.4
anything

4344.159 --> 4350.799999999999
i'd rather have [ __ ] globers instead

4348.239 --> 4352.799999999999
that at least got the chemistry right at

4350.8 --> 4356.400000000001
least they got the math right they know

4352.8 --> 4358.159000000001
how to do it yeah

4356.4 --> 4361.04
they might be globed hearts and

4358.159 --> 4362.719
constantly whining about how this girl

4361.04 --> 4364.32
going over the horizon

4362.719 --> 4366.64
yeah it's [ __ ] annoying but it's

4364.32 --> 4369.759999999999
better than some [ __ ] little [ __ ]

4366.64 --> 4372.88
telling me that water is an element and

4369.76 --> 4375.12
that atoms aren't real go [ __ ] yourself

4372.88 --> 4376.96
dude go to hell

4375.12 --> 4380.48
i don't want to have anything to do with

4376.96 --> 4382.88
you you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] you're worse

4380.48 --> 4384.48
than a glober worse

4382.88 --> 4386.88
way

4384.48 --> 4386.879999999999
worse

4396.56 --> 4401.120000000001
if it's not broken

4398.8 --> 4402.2390000000005
don't try to

4401.12 --> 4405.199
fix it

4402.239 --> 4408.4
there's already enough broken [ __ ] out

4405.199 --> 4411.04
there we need to fix and then deal with

4408.4 --> 4413.679
people that that insist that it isn't

4411.04 --> 4416.8
broken yeah that's already hard enough

4413.679 --> 4418.8
as it is we don't need you to just

4416.8 --> 4421.84
break open things that have worked

4418.8 --> 4424.4800000000005
perfectly fine and then just say it's

4421.84 --> 4426.400000000001
wrong it's wrong it's totally different

4424.48 --> 4428.5599999999995
man

4426.4 --> 4431.44
i'm a [ __ ] like i'm just going to

4428.56 --> 4433.6
create reality

4431.44 --> 4436.599999999999
yeah we don't [ __ ] need you go to

4433.6 --> 4436.6
hell

4449.6 --> 4452.6
um

4457.52 --> 4462.56
the photoelectric effect oh goody

4460.239 --> 4465.959999999999
professor field bell i'm sure it's going

4462.56 --> 4465.96
to be brilliant

4469.6 --> 4473.84
and i have my issues with the

4470.96 --> 4476.64
photoelectric effect or rather the

4473.84 --> 4478.08
establishment

4476.64 --> 4481.08
that was

4478.08 --> 4481.08
concluded

4482.48 --> 4488.639999999999
the conclusions that were drawn from it

4484.8 --> 4488.64
that's where i get the problems with it

4492.56 --> 4497.1990000000005
do you think they will ever

4494.88 --> 4500.08
come up with economical ways to split

4497.199 --> 4503.04
water for low they already have that

4500.08 --> 4507.12
steamy traveler it's already there

4503.04 --> 4507.12
it's been developing since the 90s

4509.28 --> 4514.32
they're just not giving it us

4511.84 --> 4516.4800000000005
like straight out like oh here's the new

4514.32 --> 4518.32
industry because they're we're still in

4516.48 --> 4521.12
a little face

4518.32 --> 4524.0
right we're in a little face oh it's a

4521.12 --> 4527.44
shortage of the climate change so we're

4524.0 --> 4529.84
not getting the new trinkets we gotta

4527.44 --> 4533.36
die some more first

4529.84 --> 4535.76
yeah from overheating and freezing to

4533.36 --> 4539.28
death in winter we gotta die some more

4535.76 --> 4541.76
first before the new world order and oh

4539.28 --> 4544.4
look at those trinkets we have found oh

4541.76 --> 4546.159000000001
yes it's not like we've had them for 40

4544.4 --> 4549.12
years and we just held them back because

4546.159 --> 4552.48
we're complete [ __ ] and we insist

4549.12 --> 4554.32
that you die some more before we get we

4552.48 --> 4556.0
give you some of this

4554.32 --> 4558.32
yes

4556.0 --> 4560.719
secretary said

4558.32 --> 4563.92
a new society

4560.719 --> 4566.96
first you have to die some more and then

4563.92 --> 4572.36
then we might give you the trinkets that

4566.96 --> 4572.36
we've been holding back for 40 years

4582.8 --> 4585.12
ah

4590.56 --> 4594.4800000000005
good impression of class

4592.64 --> 4596.88
it klaus is really

4594.48 --> 4598.799999999999
easy to mimic really that's why

4596.88 --> 4601.04
everybody does it because it's just

4598.8 --> 4603.28
really easy

4601.04 --> 4604.64
i mean he i think that it's not even his

4603.28 --> 4607.12
own

4604.64 --> 4610.400000000001
i think he literally is an actor he's

4607.12 --> 4612.64
doing that accent as an act

4610.4 --> 4614.96
and he might have been doing that since

4612.64 --> 4616.159000000001
he was like a teenager it might be his

4614.96 --> 4619.199
life act

4616.159 --> 4623.759999999999
but how he talks that's an act that's

4619.199 --> 4625.36
not nat that's not naturally how belgium

4623.76 --> 4628.719
people or

4625.36 --> 4630.96
people from luxembourg or germany talk

4628.719 --> 4634.64
in english that's not how they talk

4630.96 --> 4638.32
that's how people in movies

4634.64 --> 4640.96
acting like their german overlords talk

4638.32 --> 4642.639999999999
yeah that's not how normal

4640.96 --> 4644.88
german

4642.64 --> 4647.04
language people speak

4644.88 --> 4650.96
in english it's ridiculous it's

4647.04 --> 4653.199
hollywood style everybody can do that

4650.96 --> 4655.76
right why can everybody do it because

4653.199 --> 4656.96
it's hollywood style that's not really

4655.76 --> 4659.360000000001
how do

4656.96 --> 4662.36
german people talk in english it's

4659.36 --> 4662.36
ridiculous

4681.76 --> 4687.08
yeah nobody gives a [ __ ] dude get the

4683.84 --> 4687.08
[ __ ] out

4697.28 --> 4703.88
okay maybe not get the [ __ ] out but

4699.679 --> 4703.88
why would nobody cares

4707.92 --> 4712.4
like you don't have to inform me you got

4710.08 --> 4714.239
startled because somebody did something

4712.4 --> 4715.92
where you're at okay

4714.239 --> 4717.678999999999
i don't care

4715.92 --> 4719.6
keep it to yourself

4717.679 --> 4723.84
that's not a a

4719.6 --> 4723.84
news worth sharing in my chat

4724.96 --> 4728.4800000000005
unless they just told you you won the

4726.8 --> 4731.12
lottery and you're going to donate to my

4728.48 --> 4733.5199999999995
paypal then something else

4731.12 --> 4735.199
oxygen does not burn

4733.52 --> 4738.159000000001
that's right

4735.199 --> 4740.0
but it does oxidate

4738.159 --> 4744.5199999999995
and something that's burning is

4740.0 --> 4744.52
definitely gonna burn a lot faster

4766.88 --> 4770.56
sss it was flammable

4773.44 --> 4777.759999999999
yeah that's

4775.44 --> 4780.879999999999
that's colloquial talk you'd know what

4777.76 --> 4783.360000000001
she meant don't be an ass

4780.88 --> 4786.719
i mean i'm pretty sure that like seeking

4783.36 --> 4790.5199999999995
star wars is not like a trained chemist

4786.719 --> 4790.52
she's not that type

4790.719 --> 4794.159
she doesn't talk like that

4795.36 --> 4802.159
yes oxygen is technically not flammable

4798.32 --> 4805.04
but yeah oxygen and hydrogen combined is

4802.159 --> 4806.799999999999
literally the most flammable combination

4805.04 --> 4809.199
possible

4806.8 --> 4811.6
it's actually so flammable it literally

4809.199 --> 4814.719
detonates

4811.6 --> 4814.719
it's quite dangerous

4815.679 --> 4819.4400000000005
yeah it's more than combustible it

4817.6 --> 4823.08
detonates

4819.44 --> 4823.08
a heavy explosive

4832.88 --> 4836.4800000000005
do as you wish

4834.239 --> 4838.799999999999
dude no

4836.48 --> 4841.12
don't do it it's not worth it man i mean

4838.8 --> 4843.1990000000005
seriously just one stupid little balloon

4841.12 --> 4846.32
of combined gas

4843.199 --> 4848.5599999999995
like can literally blow your head off if

4846.32 --> 4851.04
that thing detonates like right next to

4848.56 --> 4853.120000000001
you within half a meter it'll blow your

4851.04 --> 4855.6
head off

4853.12 --> 4855.599999999999
[ __ ] up

4857.44 --> 4861.759999999999
you

4858.32 --> 4864.32
i guarantee you you will be deaf

4861.76 --> 4866.320000000001
if not dead

4864.32 --> 4868.0
anyway

4866.32 --> 4870.96
don't [ __ ] around with hydrogen and

4868.0 --> 4872.88
oxygen it is really dangerous

4870.96 --> 4876.08
that's also why there should always be

4872.88 --> 4879.36
great care with electrolysis

4876.08 --> 4882.5599999999995
when splitting water into both elements

4879.36 --> 4885.12
it should be done with great care

4882.56 --> 4887.4400000000005
even it could be industrialized and then

4885.12 --> 4889.5199999999995
even it should be done with great care

4887.44 --> 4891.759999999999
and precaution systems

4889.52 --> 4895.84
because it is potentially extremely

4891.76 --> 4898.8
dangerous if gas amounts can in some way

4895.84 --> 4901.1990000000005
in some error build up together and then

4898.8 --> 4904.159000000001
a spark dude

4901.199 --> 4907.28
that's like a crater

4904.159 --> 4907.28
it's very dangerous

4909.52 --> 4915.1990000000005
right anyway i'm gonna round out the

4911.12 --> 4917.84
show it's been very rowdy today

4915.199 --> 4917.839999999999
i think

4920.48 --> 4925.44
very

4922.0 --> 4925.44
flat earth themed

4925.76 --> 4931.84
just like to remind aranca wumble that

4927.92 --> 4931.84
he's not banned i only timed him out

4932.0 --> 4938.159
because he was ball squirting

4934.88 --> 4938.159000000001
and that annoys me

4939.04 --> 4943.5199999999995
right

4941.04 --> 4944.8
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

4943.52 --> 4946.96
liked this show

4944.8 --> 4949.1990000000005
i thought it was cool it was yeah

4946.96 --> 4951.199
shorter than usual

4949.199 --> 4953.44
this is weird because now sometimes i

4951.199 --> 4956.638999999999
just really start on time and then i end

4953.44 --> 4959.44
up like doing a two hour 15 minute show

4956.639 --> 4962.159000000001
but those tend to be really good

4959.44 --> 4963.678999999999
not this is not so long

4962.159 --> 4965.44
but anyway

4963.679 --> 4967.4400000000005
if you like this show then please don't

4965.44 --> 4969.44
forget to rogan's it up and if you

4967.44 --> 4971.44
haven't already subscribe to my channel

4969.44 --> 4973.28
and hit the bell notification so you

4971.44 --> 4975.199
know what i'm going live which is

4973.28 --> 4977.199
normally 1pm amsterdam time in the

4975.199 --> 4980.08
weekdays and 2 p.m amsterdam time in the

4977.199 --> 4982.08
weekend and please also do support me

4980.08 --> 4983.92
through the paypal patreon super chat

4982.08 --> 4986.4
and the membership system join button

4983.92 --> 4988.08
they'll be much appreciated they can

4986.4 --> 4989.36
always use it

4988.08 --> 4992.08
thanks again

4989.36 --> 4994.5599999999995
elise g for the paypal donation last

4992.08 --> 4995.5199999999995
evening it was great please keep it

4994.56 --> 4998.080000000001
coming

4995.52 --> 4999.040000000001
or you or anybody else out there i still

4998.08 --> 5000.719
need it

4999.04 --> 5002.8
i just

5000.719 --> 5005.6
bought had to buy a new mouse because

5002.8 --> 5007.52
this one is just is seriously getting on

5005.6 --> 5009.360000000001
my nerves

5007.52 --> 5011.120000000001
and that did cost me like

5009.36 --> 5012.32
60 euros i think

5011.12 --> 5013.679
yeah

5012.32 --> 5017.04
but it's a good one

5013.679 --> 5017.04
and this one lasted

5017.12 --> 5020.4
like 10 years i think

5019.36 --> 5022.32
so

5020.4 --> 5023.36
maybe seven

5022.32 --> 5025.12
anyway

5023.36 --> 5028.08
i will be back tomorrow with flat earth
