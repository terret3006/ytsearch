things I have a

2865.28 --> 2873.0
suspicion it might even be sounds

2868.48 --> 2874.72
ridiculous but it's a guess it might the

2873.0 --> 2876.05
budget might be coming out of space

2874.72 --> 2878.2799999999997
force

2876.05 --> 2882.0
[Music]

2878.28 --> 2885.1600000000003
right space force to reinforce space a

2882.0 --> 2887.52

2885.16 --> 2887.52
just

2888.2 --> 2894.04
nag and everything threaten and whatever

2897.079 --> 2901.3590000000004
a

2897.92 --> 2903.559
lot well that would

2901.359 --> 2907.44
effectively basically get the flat

2903.559 --> 2910.6400000000003
earthers out of the way and make people

2907.44 --> 2913.64

2976.04 --> 2981.319
prostitution as well that doesn't make

2977.799 --> 2981.319
it very appealing though

2994.52 --> 2997.52
eh

3000.319 --> 3006.04
have I made up I apologize the flat

3006.359 --> 3011.64
soid a while

3008.4 --> 3015.52
back but I mean he doesn't want

3011.64 --> 3015.52
me on my show

3018.839 --> 3024.599
so he accepted the apology but I mean

3021.68 --> 3027.16
I'm not going to be in contact with flat

3024.599 --> 3030.44
soid so

3027.16 --> 3030.44
and I don't really want to

3047.68 --> 3050.9199999999996
[Music]

3054.44 --> 3057.44
either

3060.28 --> 3063.6400000000003
yes Gavin B it is very

3084.359 --> 3090.2
dodgy understand

3087.48 --> 3093.72
Africans a

3090.2 --> 3098.52
little it's very close to Dutch

3093.72 --> 3098.52
but there's some distinct differences

3114.359 --> 3117.359
so

3118.839 --> 3126.0
will not make up hey I'm making up fine

3121.799 --> 3128.28
he doesn't want me back so what else can

3126.0 --> 3131.079
I do you

3128.28 --> 3133.1600000000003
know I'd love to make peace with him and

3131.079 --> 3134.319
maybe even then kind of hang around with

3133.16 --> 3137.0789999999997
him or

3134.319 --> 3139.319
whatever but he doesn't want me back I

3137.079 --> 3141.4
went over that line for him and you

3139.319 --> 3143.96
can't undo that or

3141.4 --> 3145.839
whatever I've been rage wiy and all that

3143.96 --> 3150.559
and I get it

3145.839 --> 3154.96
I have regrets I have regrets about rage

3150.559 --> 3154.96
win but I also know where it came

3156.92 --> 3161.52
from and I've been put under

3164.599 --> 3169.079
pressure and I'm getting underneath from

3167.48 --> 3172.68
that

3169.079 --> 3174.92
pressure just doing my own thing and

3172.68 --> 3179.04
it's better I mean I don't really have

3174.92 --> 3179.04
any rage win since have I

3179.24 --> 3186.359
so do I spend most of my time speaking

3182.96 --> 3186.359
Dutch or English

3188.92 --> 3194.88
uh well in the last few years it's been

3192.24 --> 3197.359
mostly English didn't really talk all

3194.88 --> 3199.839
that much with people but in the recent

3197.359 --> 3204.16
few weeks I've talked a

3199.839 --> 3205.68
lot with people in Dutch

3204.16 --> 3208.0
so

3205.68 --> 3209.24
and I'm also interested in basically

3208.0 --> 3212.88
trying to

3209.24 --> 3216.3999999999996
do flat earth related streams in

3212.88 --> 3219.559
Dutch I'm interested in that I just

3216.4 --> 3222.599
really haven't bumped into any flat

3219.559 --> 3225.28
earthers that are Dutch that like to do

3222.599 --> 3229.839
videos and all that and I suggested to

3225.28 --> 3231.76
q& Fe who is Dutch to maybe do that so

3229.839 --> 3233.72
that might happen in the future that

3231.76 --> 3236.559
would be

3233.72 --> 3239.2
interesting I'd like to know more Dutch

3236.559 --> 3241.599
Flat earthers I know there's quite a lot

3239.2 --> 3241.5989999999997
of them

3243.319 --> 3249.04
here do I have any role models

3249.88 --> 3252.88
no

3257.92 --> 3262.88
nope Heroes look up to

3260.68 --> 3267.0789999999997
me

3262.88 --> 3268.799
uh no

3267.079 --> 3272.2000000000003
I mean there might be some people that

3268.799 --> 3274.599
look up to me for some kind of level of

3272.2 --> 3278.3999999999996
bravery or whatever that they feel they

3274.599 --> 3278.4
don't they can't do that

3278.96 --> 3283.799
or I mean I'm putting myself down here

3281.52 --> 3288.319
with a Daily Show talking very openly

3283.799 --> 3288.319
dealing with [ __ ] trolls dealing with

3291.28 --> 3296.2400000000002

3294.079 --> 3297.6800000000003
Brave

3296.24 --> 3300.7599999999998
right

3297.68 --> 3303.359
but no there's not really people looking

3300.76 --> 3303.3590000000004
up to me I

3304.76 --> 3311.92
mean although in ways like my

3309.04 --> 3314.92
friends that are well my friends because

3311.92 --> 3317.52
they're like also spiritual nature they

3314.92 --> 3320.92
do actually in ways look up to me and

3317.52 --> 3323.92
they tell me and that is like very

3320.92 --> 3323.92
encouraging

3324.0 --> 3328.079
but

3325.559 --> 3329.3190000000004
yeah it all is what it is I don't really

3328.079 --> 3331.559
have a role

3329.319 --> 3333.64
model there's some people that I think

3331.559 --> 3337.079
are really cool though it's just that

3333.64 --> 3339.7599999999998
they're different like for example Mark

3337.079 --> 3342.1600000000003
Sergeant I think Mark Sergeant is like

3339.76 --> 3342.1600000000003
pretty

3343.72 --> 3349.7599999999998
cool he's so incredibly stable and I

3347.319 --> 3349.7599999999998
find that

3354.0 --> 3359.599
remarkable

3355.88 --> 3359.599
David Wise app yeah yeah yeah

3359.72 --> 3365.68
whatever not every flat earther has the

3362.48 --> 3368.16
David Wise app moon

3365.68 --> 3370.44
rover yeah there's plenty of flat

3368.16 --> 3373.799
earthers in the Netherlands too that are

3370.44 --> 3373.799
like kind of

3376.119 --> 3382.1600000000003
paranoid yeah I mean in an ideal world

3380.079 --> 3385.76
it's like yeah we just come out for Flat

3382.16 --> 3387.52
Earth and then oh we all like oh it's

3385.76 --> 3390.3190000000004
okay now it's okay you could just say

3387.52 --> 3392.28
it's flat and we can just move on but

3390.319 --> 3396.0
yeah there are

3392.28 --> 3400.3590000000004
like very strong money backed forces

3396.0 --> 3403.039
that want to force it away again they

3400.359 --> 3405.799
want Flat Earth to go

3403.039 --> 3408.48
away and they'll do

3405.799 --> 3411.24
manipulation and potential Scare Tactics

3408.48 --> 3411.2400000000002
to try to do

3412.4 --> 3417.319
it paranoid why oh why why do you

3425.96 --> 3431.0
think Mark Sergeant was a pin wizard

3429.52 --> 3434.48
yeah I mean he was the gamer and all

3431.0 --> 3434.48
that but yeah

3443.799 --> 3446.799
whatever

3448.599 --> 3453.079
yeah but you got to realize in my past

3451.0 --> 3455.48
and I'm talking quite a some time ago

3453.079 --> 3458.319
way before

3455.48 --> 3461.319
2015 I'd been pretty

3458.319 --> 3465.599
threatened like

3461.319 --> 3468.079
severely over my curiosity in Flat Earth

3465.599 --> 3470.92
I sort of shared this

3468.079 --> 3475.2000000000003
stuff but it's a long time

3470.92 --> 3477.76
ago and I'm like not in contact with

3475.2 --> 3477.7599999999998
those people

3478.119 --> 3481.119
anymore

3483.64 --> 3487.8799999999997
right and then the

3489.0 --> 3494.72
whole Flat Earth Awakening 20145

3492.68 --> 3497.24
happened and like that kind of just

3494.72 --> 3501.359
seemed to change

3497.24 --> 3503.319
everything it made people kind of stop

3501.359 --> 3506.0389999999998
overtly

3503.319 --> 3507.799
threatening right because before that

3506.039 --> 3510.48
there was like nowhere to go with it

3507.799 --> 3513.839
it's like oh is the earth flat or how's

3510.48 --> 3516.119
this but there was you couldn't really

3513.839 --> 3518.24
find anybody to talk about it it was

3516.119 --> 3521.76
more hush

3518.24 --> 3521.7599999999998
hush and there were

3523.88 --> 3531.2000000000003
threats but after

3527.0 --> 3533.72
20145 that kind of stopped and it became

3531.2 --> 3536.72
open up for some

3533.72 --> 3536.72
reason

3543.24 --> 3549.9599999999996
you met Mark

3545.76 --> 3554.4
awesome I think I met him too in 2019

3549.96 --> 3558.839
he's a really awesome guy he's really

3554.4 --> 3558.839
nice and in a way he's like

3560.2 --> 3567.4399999999996
Fearless like he's like the type of guy

3563.72 --> 3570.3999999999996
if you really threat him he just shrugs

3567.44 --> 3573.359
it off immediately without a Flinch he's

3570.4 --> 3573.359
pretty amazing like

3576.079 --> 3580.6800000000003
that maybe that's because he's been a

3578.48 --> 3582.52
gamer and in Gamers people get pretty

3580.68 --> 3586.0389999999998
Savage and all

3582.52 --> 3588.88
that so he just got training for it I

3586.039 --> 3591.4
don't know why exactly

3588.88 --> 3593.6400000000003
but I always thought Mark Sergeant was a

3591.4 --> 3596.64
very cool

3593.64 --> 3596.64
guy

3598.119 --> 3604.96
one of the few people remaining

3601.079 --> 3607.039
that I do in a way look up to but I look

3604.96 --> 3609.799
up to him for a very specific reason and

3607.039 --> 3614.76
that is because of

3609.799 --> 3614.7599999999998
his emotional self-control which is

3615.96 --> 3622.52
remarkable like I do not have that level

3618.72 --> 3622.52
of control I'm a bit

3623.319 --> 3627.92
jealous and I'm not jealous

3628.52 --> 3634.16
easily right another person I kind of

3631.16 --> 3635.3999999999996
also look up to for other reasons is ow

3634.16 --> 3638.48
and

3635.4 --> 3641.1600000000003
Benjamin cuz he's just this NeverEnding

3638.48 --> 3641.16
Fountain of

3646.72 --> 3653.52
inspiration and he's very

3649.44 --> 3656.52
ballsy and I really respect

3653.52 --> 3656.52
that

3661.119 --> 3665.359
yeah yeah it's very calm very

3666.0 --> 3671.24
chill you do not like him I don't care

3669.68 --> 3673.68
it's a completely different type of

3671.24 --> 3673.68
person

3676.24 --> 3683.4399999999996
so but he has qualities that I

3679.559 --> 3685.88
find remarkable as

3683.44 --> 3688.559
well

3685.88 --> 3694.319
right and and even

3688.559 --> 3697.8390000000004
like sounds weird Eric de Bay too like

3694.319 --> 3697.839
because Eric de

3698.28 --> 3705.119
is he's really spiritual and he's really

3701.28 --> 3707.28
serious about it and he's gone through a

3705.119 --> 3710.48
lot of

3707.28 --> 3713.44
development like in the first few years

3710.48 --> 3715.64
he was really kind of gaming

3713.44 --> 3719.76
ways

3715.64 --> 3721.5989999999997
and that like it was like his form and

3719.76 --> 3725.8390000000004
all it was kind of a troll Hive it was

3721.599 --> 3727.799
bit annoying but the more recent videos

3725.839 --> 3728.68
they just keep getting more interesting

3727.799 --> 3731.68
and

3728.68 --> 3731.68
more

3735.2 --> 3740.359
pure and he's not right about everything

3737.92 --> 3742.359
I mean his ideas about veganism I

3740.359 --> 3744.96
completely disagree to that but I mean

3742.359 --> 3747.799
that's his thing

3744.96 --> 3750.359
right I'm not going to complain about it

3747.799 --> 3750.359
I just don't

3758.94 --> 3762.119
[Music]

3768.92 --> 3772.039
[Music]

3773.359 --> 3776.359
agree

3780.0 --> 3782.2
yeah

3782.76 --> 3786.559
duper yeah that's a while

3789.44 --> 3794.0
ago some of those shows were kind of

3803.279 --> 3806.279
weird

3863.2 --> 3866.2
for

3870.279 --> 3873.72
just like the way in with

3874.359 --> 3877.359
it

3893.16 --> 3896.16
yeah

3904.72 --> 3909.24
right but I mean I'm talking about

3907.48 --> 3912.2400000000002
things other than Flat Earth

3909.24 --> 3912.24
argumentation

3914.24 --> 3920.279
because like Mark Sergeant is not the

3917.2 --> 3922.1189999999997
best guy to make an argument for Flat

3920.279 --> 3925.119
Earth against Ballers or anything and

3922.119 --> 3929.2400000000002
neither is Eric Deb really getting a bit

3925.119 --> 3933.279
better wit it is

3929.24 --> 3935.68
okay Nathan is really good at it

3933.279 --> 3938.039
technically but I do think that he's

3935.68 --> 3941.5589999999997
like a bit

3938.039 --> 3941.559
overfocused on those

3948.96 --> 3956.079
things but when it comes to like

3951.44 --> 3956.079
hardcore rottles to antiag

3956.64 --> 3962.44
earther nonsense talk like yeah Nathan

3959.599 --> 3964.88
Oakley is kind of like the guy to to

3962.44 --> 3964.88
figure it

3966.88 --> 3971.92
out Nathan did more structur debate yeah

3969.48 --> 3971.92
it's up to

3983.0 --> 3986.0
him

many flight paths make sense I addressed

5179.08 --> 5183.159
that yesterday

5181.199 --> 5186.04
duper

5183.159 --> 5189.36
it's because the flight

5186.04 --> 5192.48
paths go past

5189.36 --> 5196.28
land they like to move past land but in

5192.48 --> 5198.638999999999
the AE model that makes them seem go in

5196.28 --> 5198.639
straight

5200.199 --> 5208.08

5204.36 --> 5208.08

5670.36 --> 5675.88
internet forever like what kind of a

5673.08 --> 5675.88
solution is

5690.48 --> 5693.48

5784.56 --> 5790.6
I could do that every

5786.639 --> 5793.6
day but I don't think I

5790.6 --> 5796.360000000001
can it just has to be the right moment

5793.6 --> 5796.360000000001

I know I just I'm not like G to like I

5820.96 --> 5825.639
said a couple of things

5822.8 --> 5828.159000000001
to I just was looking and I noticed

5825.639 --> 5832.639
Gavin B

5828.159 --> 5834.879999999999
there basically having tet tell him like

5832.639 --> 5838.28
oh he shouldn't visit here anymore

5834.88 --> 5839.92
and and I noticed that so I said like

5838.28 --> 5842.92
what are you

5839.92 --> 5845.96
doing I don't I know if they like ban me

5842.92 --> 5845.96
or anything I don't think

5850.119 --> 5859.04
so or maybe

5853.08 --> 5859.04
it whoa they did what

5864.32 --> 5868.36
the that's

5870.199 --> 5873.199
nuts

5880.92 --> 5885.639
I hold myself to the same standard as

5883.52 --> 5888.639
you demand of

5885.639 --> 5888.639
others

5889.4 --> 5895.4
yeah what

5892.119 --> 5898.04
happened I think I got like banned in

5895.4 --> 5898.04
fed

5899.32 --> 5906.08
chat I was just say

5902.56 --> 5908.4400000000005
say like what are you doing to Gavin be

5906.08 --> 5908.44
one

5915.76 --> 5923.04
time think some may have issues with

5919.92 --> 5923.04
that and turn against

5923.96 --> 5930.119
you right but I don't see though like

5927.239 --> 5931.919999999999
I'm not trolling

5930.119 --> 5935.759999999999

5931.92 --> 5935.76
do I troll people Richard

5942.719 --> 5949.92

it right holding people same standards

5954.56 --> 5961.92
yeah well are my standards that

5959.04 --> 5964.239
unreasonable if I just know that people

5961.92 --> 5968.76
are like making up complete nonsense

5964.239 --> 5970.0
stories that are like logically fake and

5968.76 --> 5972.8
very

5970.0 --> 5974.76
unrealistic and then eventually like get

5972.8 --> 5978.320000000001
sick of it and kick him out I mean what

5974.76 --> 5978.320000000001
is unreasonable about

5980.0 --> 5987.36
that right my show is very interactive

5983.159 --> 5990.839999999999
with the chat so I got to keep it

6016.239 --> 6022.959999999999
argumentation behind

6018.639 --> 6022.96
it see like

6023.08 --> 6029.08
seriously right the official story

6026.44 --> 6031.919999999999
Hitler killed himself at the

6029.08 --> 6035.679
bunker and then they found his

6031.92 --> 6042.08
body and was the skeleton of a

6035.679 --> 6042.08
woman so why is that so incredibly

6042.32 --> 6048.5599999999995
stupid yeah what how do you explain it

6049.92 --> 6052.96

Hitler was a lesbian all the way I don't

6180.719 --> 6184.76
think that I think it was a

6186.0 --> 6193.36
double is Flat Earth boring uh well if

6189.92 --> 6196.04
I'm just me alone here talking to the

6193.36 --> 6199.0

6196.04 --> 6202.159
little boring it it kind of

6199.0 --> 6206.599
does unless there's like really inspired

6202.159 --> 6206.598999999999
things in relation to it to talk

6207.119 --> 6212.598999999999
about Hitler story is deranged yeah it

6210.76 --> 6215.4400000000005
kind of is I

6212.599 --> 6220.679
know but there's just Curiosities about

6246.239 --> 6254.28
from Flat Earth

6249.52 --> 6254.280000000001
yeah and hey I talked about Flat Earth

6256.08 --> 6262.599
yesterday right this is part of the

6259.599 --> 6262.599
subjects

6289.56 --> 6292.56
for

6294.15 --> 6297.339999999999
[Music]

6298.92 --> 6304.0
how dare you talk about why is talking

6301.52 --> 6307.4800000000005
about mammoths potentially still being

6304.0 --> 6310.28
there such an idiotic subject

6307.48 --> 6313.48
why isn't it an interesting idea that

6310.28 --> 6313.48
they might still be out

6314.719 --> 6322.96
there I think it's very

6318.159 --> 6325.638999999999
interesting just like more is

6322.96 --> 6328.679
about the life that's out

6325.639 --> 6329.639
there so much that has been told to us

6328.679 --> 6334.56
was a

6329.639 --> 6339.52
lie whole dinosaur stuff has been made

6334.56 --> 6343.8
up right but yeah if there's

6339.52 --> 6346.080000000001
like potentially an entire realm segment

6343.8 --> 6349.4400000000005
hidden from us then who knows what kind

6346.08 --> 6351.8
of life is out there and mammoths might

6349.44 --> 6354.08
still be like a common an animal there

6351.8 --> 6355.92
it's just very to me it's very

6354.08 --> 6357.48
interesting that's why I had a whole

6355.92 --> 6360.76
conversation about it yesterday on my

6357.48 --> 6360.759999999999
show I mean yesterday's show was

6361.88 --> 6367.36

6364.8 --> 6370.4400000000005
thought it was a very good show today I

6367.36 --> 6371.639
guess not so much I'm a little bit more

6370.44 --> 6374.5599999999995
cranky

6371.639 --> 6377.159000000001
and it's not really coming out and

6374.56 --> 6379.400000000001
mostly complaining in in the chat so

6377.159 --> 6382.4
yeah that doesn't really help

6379.4 --> 6382.4

what third day in a row slowmo didn't

6732.96 --> 6736.32
show up

6734.119 --> 6737.598999999999
yeah yeah now that you're talking yeah

6736.32 --> 6740.679
it's kind of

6737.599 --> 6742.84
weird he's always been great

6740.679 --> 6746.8
but I mean he just might be busy and all

6742.84 --> 6748.599
that I think he is American so it's like

6746.8 --> 6750.92
very early for him it might just not be

6748.599 --> 6750.92
working

6757.639 --> 6763.56
out they will have a wly l in

6761.159 --> 6765.079
2027 oh they're going to try to create

6763.56 --> 6768.079000000001
one

6765.079 --> 6768.079
right

6768.84 --> 6771.84
sure

6773.239 --> 6779.919999999999
or maybe they'll just import it by then

6777.199 --> 6782.36
I mean how how silly would that be is

6779.92 --> 6784.84
just like oh we're going to use genetic

6782.36 --> 6788.079
Recreation blah blah blah need a lot of

6784.84 --> 6790.56
money to do that and then like work on

6788.079 --> 6792.84
it supposedly and then when they're

6790.56 --> 6796.679
supposedly done they basically go out

6792.84 --> 6800.159000000001
and just like import

6796.679 --> 6802.4400000000005
one for much cheaper yeah that would be

6800.159 --> 6802.44
very

7016.04 --> 7021.079
oh really you watch the show guy

7018.52 --> 7023.2390000000005
mentioned how hard it actually is to do

7021.079 --> 7026.32
it just a show reading from chat it's a

7023.239 --> 7029.879999999999
unique skill yeah it is kind of hard and

7026.32 --> 7034.719
especially if like there's just mostly

7029.88 --> 7037.8
trolls and a few people I mean it is I

7034.719 --> 7040.88
do find it difficult to do this I've

7037.8 --> 7042.96
been doing it for years I still find it

7040.88 --> 7047.599
difficult hey Steve

7042.96 --> 7047.599
Bronson spring is nearly here yes it

7048.52 --> 7053.88
is and I am looking very forward to

7061.28 --> 7068.079
it also I'd like to report

7064.48 --> 7072.199
out like not smoking

7068.079 --> 7072.199
cannabis still still working for

7073.8 --> 7078.4400000000005
me it is way better not doing

7080.639 --> 7086.76
it I could be a teacher how good am I

7083.4 --> 7089.4
speaking okay it's a bit of exaggeration

7086.76 --> 7092.079000000001
but I do my

7089.4 --> 7096.04
best Everything feels better in

7092.079 --> 7098.239
Spring yeah all it depends though if you

7096.04 --> 7101.119
have like bodily issues somewhere they

7098.239 --> 7103.44
might also like start start to get in

7101.119 --> 7106.5599999999995
flame so when I still

7103.44 --> 7109.0
had like very pronounced issues with my

7106.56 --> 7110.719
jaw and everything like during spring

7109.0 --> 7113.199
that those issues would then suddenly

7110.719 --> 7115.36
come back that was kind of annoying I

7113.199 --> 7118.5199999999995
don't think that will happen this

7115.36 --> 7121.119
year like my jaw feels way more stable

7118.52 --> 7121.119000000001
than it has

7122.159 --> 7128.48
before and not smoking cannabis also

7125.199 --> 7130.199
seems to like make it even more stable

7128.48 --> 7133.0
so that might have been been an

7130.199 --> 7133.0
influence as

7134.719 --> 7141.079
well but I am looking forward to having

7137.48 --> 7144.0
more like wind still days with some with

7141.079 --> 7145.88
some warmth and some sun looking forward

7144.0 --> 7148.88
to

7145.88 --> 7152.32
that maybe just have a white T-shirt

7148.88 --> 7156.36
again has my jaw been broken

7152.32 --> 7156.36
no it's just teeth

7158.239 --> 7161.239
issues

7166.36 --> 7171.92
now I've never broken my jaw thank God

7169.44 --> 7171.919999999999

7175.34 --> 7178.89

7188.239 --> 7191.239
annoying

7218.159 --> 7221.159
for

7225.52 --> 7231.0
right but I mean that's like I talked

7227.88 --> 7231.0
about it back then on my

7231.28 --> 7236.719
show it's just that I haven't really had

7234.079 --> 7240.96
like that kind of

7236.719 --> 7240.96
stopped last summer it kind of

7243.599 --> 7247.639
stopped and it's been doing much

7248.119 --> 7251.119

over

7397.88 --> 7402.56

they just are peer pressuring everybody

7405.8 --> 7411.96
and and

7409.239 --> 7414.48
yeah I don't know right now I'm just

7437.28 --> 7442.92
fluid very inspired today I'm just not

7440.719 --> 7447.84
really feeling it despite there being

7442.92 --> 7447.84

7513.92 --> 7519.84
looks beautiful

7516.119 --> 7522.719
but oh except for that trail

7519.84 --> 7526.1990000000005
oh no doesn't seem to be persistent it's

7522.719 --> 7528.4800000000005
beautiful but it is just windy and it is

7526.199 --> 7528.48
kind of

7541.079 --> 7544.88
cold when everything is Flowing the show

7543.4 --> 7547.679
is really good

7544.88 --> 7549.84
yeah it

7547.679 --> 7552.079
is

7549.84 --> 7555.2390000000005
it just I don't know man today I just

7552.079 --> 7558.48
woke up and it was not feeling

7555.239 --> 7558.48
great it's

7568.159 --> 7574.28
weird but I mean to be fair I've had

7571.04 --> 7579.639
like really rough times in the last few

7574.28 --> 7581.88
weeks it's like just terrible

7579.639 --> 7583.96
nightmares well not like sleeping

7581.88 --> 7586.76
nightmares but just waking nightmares

7583.96 --> 7589.28
and stuff and terrible memories from the

7586.76 --> 7593.0
past that would just keep forcing

7589.28 --> 7593.0
themselves on me and make me quite

7593.199 --> 7598.839999999999
paranoid and I it yeah I'm sorry to bore

7596.639 --> 7601.88
everybody with it it's just it's been

7598.84 --> 7605.2390000000005
very heavy on

7601.88 --> 7607.04
me and I'm still recovering I'm still in

7605.239 --> 7609.159
the middle of that and I think that I'm

7607.04 --> 7611.199
doing pretty damn well actually just

7609.159 --> 7613.799999999999
being able to do my show but yesterday's

7611.199 --> 7613.799999999999
show was

7617.48 --> 7623.879999999999
great like I didn't think I would be

7619.96 --> 7626.119
able to even do a quality show like that

7623.88 --> 7628.079
yesterday considering the state that

7626.119 --> 7631.839999999999
I've been in on

7628.079 --> 7631.84
average but it did work

7632.0 --> 7638.36
out like two days before that the show

7635.639 --> 7641.04
was sucked kind of sucked it was me just

7638.36 --> 7642.4
getting the bad news and all

7641.04 --> 7645.32
[Music]

7642.4 --> 7648.4
that but still two days later I managed

7645.32 --> 7651.4
to put a really good Showdown

7648.4 --> 7651.4
so

7652.36 --> 7656.759999999999
yeah and hopefully I'll do more of

7662.679 --> 7668.8
that but I mean also I don't even want

7666.239 --> 7672.919999999999
to like continually talk about it I

7668.8 --> 7677.159000000001
really don't it's just that this chat

7672.92 --> 7680.04
stuff and with fed man

7677.159 --> 7681.799999999999
it's I just didn't expect all this to

7680.04 --> 7687.96
happen like

7681.8 --> 7687.96
that it's like all become so sour so

7693.28 --> 7700.96
sour I don't get it like what

7697.199 --> 7703.36
did what did I do that was just so

7700.96 --> 7707.28
insurmountable so

7703.36 --> 7709.92
unforgivable that like obvious trolls I

7707.28 --> 7712.96
mean obvious trolls people that have

7709.92 --> 7716.4800000000005
trolled for years

7712.96 --> 7719.04
years are just like allowed to now just

7716.48 --> 7719.04
like

7719.32 --> 7723.719
hang like they're they've always been

7721.76 --> 7727.079000000001
there and their friends like I don't

7723.719 --> 7731.199
understand I don't understand

7727.079 --> 7731.199
this like why is that

7731.28 --> 7735.199
happening I can't explain like I don't

7734.28 --> 7739.559
understand

7735.199 --> 7739.558999999999
it I'm really puzzled by

7757.32 --> 7760.32
it

7761.199 --> 7765.079
I don't know man maybe I should do like

7763.159 --> 7768.079
a full unbanning

7765.079 --> 7769.96
again just to see like how how they're

7768.079 --> 7772.119
going to be but I mean if they're just

7769.96 --> 7775.04
going to be bitching and whining and and

7772.119 --> 7778.4
trying to you're really pathetic or

7775.04 --> 7780.719
whatever I mean what do you expect like

7778.4 --> 7782.558999999999
I'm a I'm a live show I interact with

7780.719 --> 7785.599
the live chat if people are literally

7782.559 --> 7787.639
going to be mocking me like you can't

7785.599 --> 7791.04
seriously expect I'm just going to leave

7787.639 --> 7795.400000000001
you in the chat CH then

7791.04 --> 7795.4
right I mean that would make no damn

7796.48 --> 7803.44
sense it's like self-deprecation like

7799.639 --> 7806.119
why the why the hell would I do

7803.44 --> 7809.799999999999
that like what's the function of that

7806.119 --> 7812.799999999999
what's the payoff of doing

7809.8 --> 7812.8
that

7817.239 --> 7820.239
right

7837.8 --> 7842.28
yeah it's also very distractive but also

7840.4 --> 7846.159
it's just like

7842.28 --> 7846.159
why I don't get it

7847.239 --> 7850.239
why

7867.599 --> 7869.84
the

7877.159 --> 7882.719
reaction

7879.4 --> 7885.4
right but I mean look my internal

7882.719 --> 7887.88
chemistry is kind of

7885.4 --> 7890.719
changing I don't Richard G may maybe

7887.88 --> 7893.8
you've noticed I I wonder if you're up

7890.719 --> 7895.679
for answering that like do I seem

7893.8 --> 7897.1990000000005
different because since I quit smoking

7895.679 --> 7901.599
cannabis it's

7897.199 --> 7905.678999999999
like I do feel really different I don't

7901.599 --> 7905.679
really get really angry

7907.159 --> 7910.159
anymore

7912.75 --> 7916.359
[Music]

7916.96 --> 7922.8
despite there not being a shortage of

7918.92 --> 7925.1990000000005
trolls or anything it's just that I just

7922.8 --> 7928.28
now realize that just getting really

7925.199 --> 7930.199
angry over trolls showing up is like

7928.28 --> 7934.199
counterproductive where before I

7930.199 --> 7937.4
couldn't help it it was just like a

7934.199 --> 7941.119
thorn in my in my eye like I just had to

7937.4 --> 7943.96
get rid of it quick now I feel

7941.119 --> 7946.598999999999
like I'm just puzzled that it keeps

7943.96 --> 7950.8
happening like

7946.599 --> 7950.8
why why do you come here to do

7956.96 --> 7963.199
that would have expected me to be more

7959.44 --> 7966.199
agitated knowing recently quit

7963.199 --> 7969.199
smoking

7966.199 --> 7971.48
yeah but I'm not I'm not really getting

7969.199 --> 7971.48
that

7984.44 --> 7992.44
agitated right I mean before a while

7987.84 --> 7995.28
back I I would say yeah I am now forc to

7992.44 --> 7999.32
involuntarily quit smoking cannabis that

7995.28 --> 8000.239
pissed me off but since recently it's

7999.32 --> 8003.44
not

8000.239 --> 8005.28
involuntarily it's like no I just it it

8003.44 --> 8008.239
it's not the same

8005.28 --> 8009.599
anymore now when I smoke it's making me

8008.239 --> 8013.239
really

8009.599 --> 8013.2390000000005
paranoid it's very

8016.36 --> 8022.558999999999
bad so and it costs me money that I

8020.239 --> 8025.5199999999995
don't have and that effectively when I

8022.559 --> 8028.52
think about it carefully is part of the

8025.52 --> 8030.119000000001
reason why I got into death if I had to

8028.52 --> 8032.76
be very

8030.119 --> 8035.04
honest it's a basic

8032.76 --> 8037.719
calculation and so

8035.04 --> 8040.76
like I'm just quitting and I'm just

8037.719 --> 8043.28
hoping trying to reorient myself as to

8040.76 --> 8047.2390000000005
like okay so how is does this all work

8043.28 --> 8051.559
now it's all kind of new to

8047.239 --> 8054.36
me it's been a while since I were not

8051.559 --> 8057.159000000001
smoking cannabis it's been quite a quite

8054.36 --> 8060.32
some time almost a decade I've been

8057.159 --> 8060.32
doing that for quite a

8064.599 --> 8069.88
while maybe I'm just better at it i'

8067.599 --> 8071.84
like to think so Steve Bronson thank you

8069.88 --> 8075.52
for the supportive

8071.84 --> 8078.159000000001
words I mean I really I am doing my best

8075.52 --> 8080.079000000001
right I mean you guys do recognize that

8078.159 --> 8083.36
are still here you do recognize that I

8080.079 --> 8086.88
am actually trying to do my

8083.36 --> 8089.88
best but yeah at the same

8086.88 --> 8093.599
time

8089.88 --> 8093.599
I may have some issues

8094.199 --> 8099.879999999999
here that have been building over the

8097.599 --> 8105.04
years

8099.88 --> 8105.04
slowly my friend from says that

8106.48 --> 8110.879999999999
U what do you what do you call

8116.8 --> 8119.8
that

8121.719 --> 8127.8
okay

8123.84 --> 8131.32
stressed or over strung that's what she

8127.8 --> 8134.639
says what I'm experiencing is that and

8131.32 --> 8137.0
it makes sense and I I kind of recognize

8134.639 --> 8141.36
it a little like in my mom who had that

8137.0 --> 8144.719
too like the just the tension becomes

8141.36 --> 8147.799999999999
too much and it leads to

8144.719 --> 8150.639
like weird anxiety and and just feel

8147.8 --> 8153.400000000001
feelings of dread that you can't really

8150.639 --> 8158.079
place that that that start to play with

8153.4 --> 8158.079
your head I've been having those

8163.599 --> 8169.360000000001
issues regular weed smoking his bad

8166.48 --> 8169.36
spend a lot of time

8169.599 --> 8173.88
alone maybe Steve

8176.719 --> 8179.719
Ronson

8183.8 --> 8189.4400000000005
you scared all the most yeah I'm not

8186.92 --> 8189.4400000000005
telling you

8195.219 --> 8201.189999999999
[Music]

8202.96 --> 8209.678999999998
that what's the worst thing that could

8206.679 --> 8209.679
happen

8210.719 --> 8215.119999999999
death that I'm being abandoned on all

8213.399 --> 8218.358999999999
sides that everybody hates me and the

8215.12 --> 8221.2
people that try to stick with me it just

8218.359 --> 8223.679
becomes too hard or too tiresome to

8221.2 --> 8227.639000000001
stick with me and that they like

8223.679 --> 8229.319
quietly move out kind of like sorry I

8227.639 --> 8232.279999999999
can't handle it anymore either like

8229.319 --> 8234.76
that's [ __ ] it's that is kind of

8232.28 --> 8236.76
like what this is starting to feel like

8234.76 --> 8238.800000000001
with all these [ __ ] trolls everywhere

8236.76 --> 8241.599
and like people that I thought were like

8238.8 --> 8243.559
sort of my friends that that were at

8241.599 --> 8246.04
least nice and hanging

8243.559 --> 8249.119999999999
around that I would like give personal

8246.04 --> 8253.28
attention in chat personally

8249.12 --> 8255.599
address like they're now just talking

8253.28 --> 8259.960000000001
[ __ ] together with the trolls that hate

8255.599 --> 8259.960000000001
me and it's really shocking to

8260.84 --> 8269.599
me is it because of what happened with

8265.08 --> 8269.599
fed it seems like it

8269.679 --> 8275.319
it seems like that

8272.2 --> 8279.16
yeah although I don't understand exactly

8275.319 --> 8279.16
like how that actually connects

8283.8 --> 8292.599
up I mean all I needed was basically a

8289.2 --> 8296.479000000001
break right this is what happened I

8292.599 --> 8299.599
needed a break I exploded right 500

8296.479 --> 8302.559
bucks or amount it it's really a fiasco

8299.599 --> 8305.679
retrospect I literally came on Nathan's

8302.559 --> 8309.0
and a member only stream a while back

8305.679 --> 8312.719000000001
just to specifically apologize for

8309.0 --> 8316.16
that and it seemed like it was rejected

8312.719 --> 8316.16
like the apology was just

8316.96 --> 8323.919999999998
rejected and

8318.96 --> 8327.16
like I don't understand like I can't

8323.92 --> 8330.639
place the Alchemy of what has happened I

8327.16 --> 8333.28
can't place it it's like I'm suddenly

8330.639 --> 8336.759999999998
dislocated with my understanding of what

8333.28 --> 8338.92
the hell is going on here I don't

8336.76 --> 8340.0
understand anymore what the [ __ ] is

8338.92 --> 8344.24
going

8340.0 --> 8347.76
on why is all of this

8344.24 --> 8352.0
happening what has dramatically changed

8347.76 --> 8352.0
so much I don't

8356.439 --> 8359.439
understand

8364.96 --> 8370.199999999999
like a relationship and yeah Steve

8366.719 --> 8373.88
Bronson I have it has feel felt a bit

8370.2 --> 8377.08
like that it's just all I needed was

8373.88 --> 8379.88
some space I felt I was just being

8377.08 --> 8381.439
treated badly there's people that

8379.88 --> 8387.839999999998
confirmed that to

8381.439 --> 8391.479000000001
me like yeah for years okay years people

8387.84 --> 8393.52
have told me like this is like not right

8391.479 --> 8397.039999999999
like what they said to you over there

8393.52 --> 8397.04
like how they like talk down to

8397.399 --> 8404.08
you when I like never

8400.04 --> 8407.28
had a bad intention

8404.08 --> 8409.28
ever and well when I exploded it was

8407.28 --> 8412.439
just like I can't take this anymore I

8409.28 --> 8415.640000000001
need my space I told all of them like I

8412.439 --> 8418.52
I just need my just just let me do my

8415.64 --> 8421.199999999999
thing I need a little room and I cranked

8418.52 --> 8425.08
out a whole bunch of good shows they

8421.2 --> 8425.08
were much longer than usual got great

8426.24 --> 8432.92
views but then suddenly like I just

8430.399 --> 8435.72
thinking like yeah well

8432.92 --> 8437.960000000001
just like ah I got some breathing room

8435.72 --> 8441.679999999998
like maybe I'll try to get back and just

8437.96 --> 8443.919999999998
like like just be friends right just I

8441.68 --> 8448.68
mean we've been around so long just like

8443.92 --> 8454.439
let's just be friendly again

8448.68 --> 8454.439
that's and they just reject me all of a

8456.319 --> 8465.08
sudden like they like it just felt like

8461.399 --> 8468.16
they just wanted to humiliate me

8465.08 --> 8471.64
more I don't understand what the hell is

8468.16 --> 8475.68
going on with that I don't understand

8471.64 --> 8478.72
why little old me needs to be so damn

8475.68 --> 8480.92
humiliated like what the [ __ ] did I ever

8478.72 --> 8484.24
do to deserve

8480.92 --> 8487.52
this why do I need to be so damn

8484.24 --> 8488.83
humiliated all the time what the [ __ ]

8487.52 --> 8492.01
did I ever

8488.83 --> 8492.01
[Music]

8497.0 --> 8504.56
do like yeah I get Rin I get angry and I

8501.84 --> 8506.24
apologize for that [ __ ] I just don't

8504.56 --> 8510.199999999999
understand anymore

8506.24 --> 8512.439
man it at this point it was more of a

8510.2 --> 8514.6
business associate yeah well that's what

8512.439 --> 8518.2
it kind of feels like I mean from

8514.6 --> 8520.439
Nathan's side it seemed more like that

8518.2 --> 8523.04
Nathan always called me friends and all

8520.439 --> 8526.64
that I consider him a friend yet he

8523.04 --> 8528.52
would never even like talk to me

8526.64 --> 8531.68
directly

8528.52 --> 8535.76
ever I would talk to him in the in the

8531.68 --> 8538.479000000001
Skype chat and he would just not

8535.76 --> 8544.359
respond ever

8538.479 --> 8548.0
yeah in a decade ever I mean that's just

8544.359 --> 8549.399000000001
freaky oh here we go again told to kill

8548.0 --> 8552.52
themselves yeah yeah yeah maybe they

8549.399 --> 8554.72
didn't like that yeah well I get that

8552.52 --> 8556.52
but I mean that's some really messed up

8554.72 --> 8559.56
trolls

8556.52 --> 8561.800000000001
though and yeah I did tell a lot of

8559.56 --> 8563.68
trolls to go kill themselves because

8561.8 --> 8567.279999999999
they really pissed me off it's called

8563.68 --> 8570.720000000001
rage win not proud of it yeah I'm not

8567.28 --> 8570.720000000001
proud of that in

8571.399 --> 8578.319
retrospect but I mean I never just told

8574.439 --> 8581.2
regular people that except maybe in the

8578.319 --> 8583.6
explosion I said that for a bit but the

8581.2 --> 8586.399000000001
next day I retracted that again it's

8583.6 --> 8589.08
like no of course nobody should kill

8586.399 --> 8593.0
themselves it's just me being very

8589.08 --> 8593.0
desperate as in leave me the [ __ ]

8594.72 --> 8600.599999999999
alone why are you so miserable to me

8604.16 --> 8608.52
right anything

8615.24 --> 8621.119999999999
really yeah and I apologized for

8618.64 --> 8623.96
it yeah

8621.12 --> 8626.800000000001
so I mean what more can I

8623.96 --> 8627.679999999998
do yeah and I've been telling people to

8626.8 --> 8634.479
kill

8627.68 --> 8637.52
themselves for like 6 seven years dude

8634.479 --> 8641.039999999999
yeah it was never that big of an issue

8637.52 --> 8642.52
it was always like oh he exploded again

8641.04 --> 8645.359
yeah that might get you into trouble

8642.52 --> 8648.359
when I'm like yeah yeah I know

8645.359 --> 8650.640000000001
whoops and then I stop again and then at

8648.359 --> 8653.720000000001
some point it goes wrong again I mean

8650.64 --> 8659.439
yeah that just happened I'm not proud of

8653.72 --> 8659.438999999998
it and I'm provably working on

8659.6 --> 8662.880000000001
it like

8666.16 --> 8670.8
provably put on a silly voice what are

8668.88 --> 8674.56
you talking

8670.8 --> 8677.438999999998
about put on a silly voice what what

8674.56 --> 8678.05
does putting on a silly voice have to do

8677.439 --> 8681.1
with

8678.05 --> 8681.099999999999
[Music]

8684.16 --> 8690.16
anything trying to help me understand

8686.8 --> 8691.679999999998
yeah yeah I'm sorry but I'm literally

8690.16 --> 8693.76
addressing what you're

8691.68 --> 8696.08
saying

8693.76 --> 8699.279
yeah and then

8696.08 --> 8700.8
what like what else can I do like

8699.279 --> 8703.800000000001
ghostly

8700.8 --> 8707.759999999998
barking kind of like a troll it's like

8703.8 --> 8710.519999999999
oh so your conclusion then would be well

8707.76 --> 8712.64
yeah you just delete your channel then

8710.52 --> 8717.16
like what else am I supposed to do to

8712.64 --> 8721.0
correct this yeah I can apologize I can

8717.16 --> 8723.92
say I was wrong and mean it and like

8721.0 --> 8728.359
promise fou

8723.92 --> 8731.359
Fouch to basically improve myself to not

8728.359 --> 8734.640000000001
do that anymore like what the hell else

8731.359 --> 8734.640000000001
could I possibly

8745.88 --> 8748.88
do

8754.56 --> 8758.359
what what are you talking about

8764.399 --> 8771.96
duper okay he talked to all

8769.08 --> 8772.84
right well keep me updated about that

8771.96 --> 8776.199999999999
that's

8772.84 --> 8778.960000000001
weird but I mean like yeah probably

8776.2 --> 8782.439
maybe I don't know it doesn't really

8778.96 --> 8787.56
matter all that much really I mean in a

8782.439 --> 8787.56
way I understand it's not nice

8787.6 --> 8795.04
but I'm not even talking about that do

8791.2 --> 8797.92
without the silly voice apology may seem

8795.04 --> 8800.12
more genuine I didn't make an apology

8797.92 --> 8803.960000000001
with a silly voice

8800.12 --> 8805.800000000001
dude I made I went over

8803.96 --> 8807.438999999998
there

8805.8 --> 8810.16
yeah

8807.439 --> 8814.64
I went over at

8810.16 --> 8819.24
fed members only stream and had them all

8814.64 --> 8823.278999999999
basically humiliate me for half an hour

8819.24 --> 8827.359
straight yeah without making any silly

8823.279 --> 8831.24
voices at all during like seven hours

8827.359 --> 8833.6
you got it a genuine apology people were

8831.24 --> 8837.319
there hearing

8833.6 --> 8840.56
it I did apologize I did make a voice

8837.319 --> 8845.278999999999
yeah I do a little voice

8840.56 --> 8849.119999999999
now because I'm quoting you to make a

8845.279 --> 8851.640000000001
contrast it's not a silly voice to make

8849.12 --> 8855.12
you sound silly it's just to be a little

8851.64 --> 8855.119999999999
different so you know the

8855.16 --> 8861.68
difference yeah it's not to mock I'm

8858.279 --> 8863.319000000001
sorry that whenever I change my tone or

8861.68 --> 8866.16
anything you

8863.319 --> 8868.64
immediately immediately assume I'm just

8866.16 --> 8870.96
mocking you I'm just mocking you like

8868.64 --> 8875.08
what the [ __ ] is wrong with you

8870.96 --> 8875.08
man don't you just know

8882.56 --> 8888.439
communication I just don't understand

8885.04 --> 8891.240000000002
why everybody is acting like

8888.439 --> 8894.720000000001
this it's

8891.24 --> 8898.439
alienating yeah normally I'm really good

8894.72 --> 8900.479
at figuring out how people work how

8898.439 --> 8903.84
they've responded especially if I hung

8900.479 --> 8907.24
around a lot now it's

8903.84 --> 8909.64
like I'm suddenly in another

8907.24 --> 8913.16
dimension it really feels like that it's

8909.64 --> 8916.358999999999
like suddenly everyone is completely

8913.16 --> 8919.92
unrecognizable to me there everybody

8916.359 --> 8924.04
just responds totally alien to

8919.92 --> 8926.359
me they're saying the craziest things

8924.04 --> 8931.560000000001
and those are people that have hung

8926.359 --> 8935.319
around around with every day for like 10

8931.56 --> 8936.91
years it makes no sense to

8935.319 --> 8938.359
me at

8936.91 --> 8942.039999999999
[Music]

8938.359 --> 8942.04
all I don't get

8942.2 --> 8947.720000000001
it yeah Steve Ronson that's cool I'm

8945.0 --> 8952.04
just not the point is I'm not just

8947.72 --> 8955.519999999999
talking about Nathan yeah Nathan is one

8952.04 --> 8959.359
thing it's like all the other

8955.52 --> 8959.359
people I don't get

8961.76 --> 8969.0
it they just follow his lead really is

8965.479 --> 8969.0
it all that soulless

8972.399 --> 8975.88
then I mean the way that you're

8974.439 --> 8977.720000000001
portraying it here it just sounds like

8975.88 --> 8981.519999999999
it's a giant slave

8977.72 --> 8983.679999999998
barge and it just like do whatever the M

8981.52 --> 8986.84
Mas

8983.68 --> 8988.92
say maybe maybe you're right I mean

8986.84 --> 8991.479
you're not actually the first to tell me

8988.92 --> 8996.88
that a bit cold

8991.479 --> 8998.278999999999
like yeah it kind of feels like it but

8996.88 --> 9001.839999999998
the point is is

8998.279 --> 9005.76
that I don't want it I don't want to be

9001.84 --> 9009.08
part of that of that way I wanted to

9005.76 --> 9012.800000000001
have a just an honest

9009.08 --> 9016.0
cooperation where I can be my own man

9012.8 --> 9017.278999999999
and just cooperate like contribute with

9016.0 --> 9021.12
my

9017.279 --> 9023.24
insights me looking in between where

9021.12 --> 9024.76
they don't look and point at interesting

9023.24 --> 9027.319
things right that's how I discovered

9024.76 --> 9029.24
physicality assumption bias that's how I

9027.319 --> 9031.92
discovered the arnian

9029.24 --> 9033.72
Paradox that sort of that's because of

9031.92 --> 9035.56
the way I do

9033.72 --> 9038.16
it but

9035.56 --> 9043.68
recently in like the last few months

9038.16 --> 9046.52
it's been like no Arwin you can't be you

9043.68 --> 9049.439
anymore you're not allowed to do those

9046.52 --> 9053.880000000001
those things that make you

9049.439 --> 9056.880000000001
unique and that's just I don't

9053.88 --> 9056.88
understand

9057.399 --> 9061.039999999999
why why is that

9063.92 --> 9070.960000000001

9089.34 --> 9092.45
[Music]

like this and

9101.2 --> 9107.84
like it's not like they can't just keep

9105.72 --> 9110.319

9107.84 --> 9113.2
going to like I can't take it anymore

9110.319 --> 9117.0
I'll do anything you say like it's not

9113.2 --> 9120.16
going to happen yeah absolutely not you

9117.0 --> 9124.8

9120.16 --> 9124.8
physically couldn't live with

9125.52 --> 9133.76
that I would become really sick and then

9130.72 --> 9137.119999999999
die and it's not an

9133.76 --> 9140.68
exaggeration yeah I have been C I really

9137.12 --> 9143.160000000002
sick in the last month now because of

9140.68 --> 9146.76

9151.0 --> 9155.96
trying to resist it and go back and just

9153.359 --> 9158.359
be humiliated and treated like a an

9155.96 --> 9160.839999999998
underling by the rest like I'm not a

9158.359 --> 9164.720000000001
main panelist anymore now I'm just a

9160.84 --> 9169.8
piece of [ __ ] on the side like that's no

9164.72 --> 9172.319
[ __ ] way in hell H I'd rather

9169.8 --> 9175.64
die

9172.319 --> 9180.119999999999
yeah I'd rather

9175.64 --> 9180.119999999999

9182.08 --> 9188.84
happen not required

9184.88 --> 9192.08
anymore yeah maybe maybe borders

9188.84 --> 9194.16
boy and I'm trying to accept that I'm

9192.08 --> 9197.6
I'm trying to accept the way it is it's

9194.16 --> 9201.399
just that it's not very pleasant I'd

9197.6 --> 9204.2
love to have just more people be here

9201.399 --> 9205.76
and because when like even now even just

9204.2 --> 9207.960000000001
talking about this subject that's kind

9205.76 --> 9207.960000000001
of

9211.319 --> 9217.72
miserable you know it's if there's just

9214.92 --> 9221.24
more people in the chat that are tuning

9217.72 --> 9224.519999999999
in that are doing it along that's cool I

9221.24 --> 9226.64
like that I just want some genuine

9224.52 --> 9229.439
people to be there and not just these

9226.64 --> 9233.199999999999
[ __ ] infiltrating

9229.439 --> 9236.6
trolls I hate them stupid trolls that

9248.68 --> 9254.04
letting it

9249.92 --> 9257.2
slide until I'm satisfied that everybody

9254.04 --> 9259.6
has seen it enough so that I could just

9257.2 --> 9264.2
address it and then kick you the [ __ ]

9259.6 --> 9268.359
out like I did today with that very very

9264.2 --> 9271.479000000001
obvious fake slick killer with like the

9268.359 --> 9274.640000000001
worst nonsensical background story I've

9271.479 --> 9276.599999999999
ever heard anybody put the chat ever

9284.88 --> 9290.8
hell I I have no doubt about it it's the

9287.96 --> 9295.039999999999
dumbest [ __ ] background story I've

9290.8 --> 9299.479
ever heard and I've seen a lot by now

9295.04 --> 9303.04
yeah I deal with it I deal with it and

9299.479 --> 9306.519999999999

9303.04 --> 9308.640000000001
chat works and I'm less super angry I

9306.52 --> 9311.76
don't tell people to kill themselves

9308.64 --> 9314.199999999999
anymore yeah because that was bad and I

9311.76 --> 9316.6
agree to that I agree that was bad I

even had this whole conversation with q

9316.6 --> 9321.84

9371.319 --> 9376.92
it so I'm like just leave him there

9374.359 --> 9381.399000000001
because it was

9376.92 --> 9383.92
meant as a real concern and not just H

9381.399 --> 9388.16
look at all he's crumbling like the

9383.92 --> 9388.16
[ __ ] troll [ __ ]

9388.68 --> 9397.24
right did I realize I was a talented

9393.6 --> 9398.319
speaker yeah I realized that at a

9397.24 --> 9401.479
younger

9398.319 --> 9406.199999999999
age it's just that I was really nervous

9401.479 --> 9410.358999999999
also to speak but then at my graduation

9406.2 --> 9412.800000000001
day in school I suddenly in front of an

9410.359 --> 9417.2
entire class just made a very elaborate

9412.8 --> 9419.84
inspired speech and they were all like

9417.2 --> 9423.399000000001
what because I had never done that

9419.84 --> 9426.92
before but I felt like this is my time

9423.399 --> 9431.039999999999
like now I'm going to show you what I

9426.92 --> 9433.399
got I I had that Talent it's just that I

9431.04 --> 9438.880000000001
was kind of nervous to show it because

9433.399 --> 9442.76
I'm also vulnerable spiritually or

9438.88 --> 9444.479
emotionally so but I did just notice

9442.76 --> 9448.0
like yeah I have a speaking Talent yeah

9444.479 --> 9452.56
my mother had amazing music talent in

9448.0 --> 9453.439
way like a brain for music ear for music

9452.56 --> 9458.6
with

9453.439 --> 9460.92
me I have like I like music I can really

9458.6 --> 9464.52
enjoy music but I'm just not really the

9460.92 --> 9467.479
one to make it but my talent expressed

9464.52 --> 9469.92
itself in Communication in verbal

9467.479 --> 9472.56
communication that's where my talent

9469.92 --> 9476.359
came in I discovered that quite early I

9472.56 --> 9480.359
mean when I was like six and seven I'd

9476.359 --> 9482.92
always like have adult conversation not

9480.359 --> 9485.640000000001
about sex but about complicated subjects

9482.92 --> 9488.439
even religion and all that with

9485.64 --> 9490.56
adults I didn't care about people of my

9488.439 --> 9495.0
own age it's like they're just retards

9490.56 --> 9497.76
they can barely even audibly talk like I

9495.0 --> 9500.68
wanted complicated conversations at a

9497.76 --> 9504.800000000001
very young age like that's what it's all

9500.68 --> 9509.2
about and like not joking like when I'm

9504.8 --> 9513.84
six seven yeah when normal people are

9509.2 --> 9516.880000000001
like I need to go and I'm like I want to

9513.84 --> 9518.64
understand what God is like does he

9516.88 --> 9522.119999999999
really exist why do some people think he

9518.64 --> 9524.72
doesn't exist like yeah that was me like

9522.12 --> 9527.319000000001
at five and

9524.72 --> 9529.679999999998
six

9527.319 --> 9532.319
like is the god from this religion

9529.68 --> 9534.92
different from that one what's going on

9532.319 --> 9537.16
like I wanted to understand complicated

9534.92 --> 9540.279
things at a very young age and I was

9537.16 --> 9543.279
capable of communicating

9540.279 --> 9543.279
it

9545.68 --> 9551.6
anyway when did I realize okay fine d

9549.6 --> 9555.359
That's

9551.6 --> 9558.439
cool right but anyway hen Brown thank

9555.359 --> 9563.12
you for the comment I will just do my

9558.439 --> 9567.08
own show but I also do worry about

9563.12 --> 9570.6
fed because you see Fed has been like a

9567.08 --> 9571.92
really important project for me there's

9570.6 --> 9573.52
been so

9571.92 --> 9576.279
much

9573.52 --> 9578.92
technical intellectual development there

9576.279 --> 9581.04
and I've been part of

9578.92 --> 9584.479
that

9581.04 --> 9588.6
right so it's not just like oh it's all

9584.479 --> 9591.96
[ __ ] now I can walk away no no dude

9588.6 --> 9594.12
there's like 10e history there I learned

9591.96 --> 9599.16
so much from

9594.12 --> 9602.279
it from the guys and we shared a lot of

9599.16 --> 9605.84
things like hours conversations after

9602.279 --> 9607.24
the show was over and all that they were

9605.84 --> 9611.08
my

9607.24 --> 9614.6
buddies and now I feel that that's

9611.08 --> 9616.88
gone I had kind of hoped that I would

9614.6 --> 9618.880000000001
like be able to do my own show and then

9616.88 --> 9622.96
still like move on like hey guys how are

9618.88 --> 9626.72
you doing how's it going but they're all

9622.96 --> 9626.72
bitter they're all bitter

9628.279 --> 9635.16
now they don't want to be friends

9631.88 --> 9637.519999999999
anymore and that

9635.16 --> 9639.24
hurts like I don't even know if it would

9637.52 --> 9643.76
be good to be friends with them with

9639.24 --> 9643.76
everything that's happened but it still

9644.52 --> 9647.52
hurts

9649.12 --> 9653.279
can somebody explain to me who Bennett

9650.96 --> 9656.359999999999
FY is the

9653.279 --> 9658.68
[ __ ] takes time yeah thank you Steve

Bronson I appreciate

9661.8 --> 9665.759999999998
you please do come more

9670.12 --> 9676.2
often do you think a lot of it stemmed

9673.0 --> 9677.319
from the flat tobacco

9676.2 --> 9680.800000000001
I don't

9677.319 --> 9683.92
know a little bit it's kind of where it

9680.8 --> 9687.278999999999
started you see where it really just

9683.92 --> 9690.319
went went astray the whole situation and

9687.279 --> 9693.24
it has been going for a while like

9690.319 --> 9696.24
unreasonable treatment that has been

9693.24 --> 9698.279
going on for for like years but I be

9696.24 --> 9699.479
like yeah whatever that's just how they

9698.279 --> 9702.960000000001
talk

9699.479 --> 9703.72
and right like I'll live through it it's

9702.96 --> 9706.56
worth

9703.72 --> 9709.039999999999
it but yeah indeed like kind of since

9706.56 --> 9712.0
flat soid it was just like these

9709.04 --> 9714.319000000001
trolls just like like they stopped

9712.0 --> 9714.319
getting

9714.359 --> 9719.16
deleted and that freaked me out and that

9717.479 --> 9722.519999999999
started with flat soy where it's just

9719.16 --> 9725.56
like these nasty nasty people like

9722.52 --> 9728.12
really nasty ass just leaving them

9725.56 --> 9730.6
around and just talk [ __ ] about me and

9728.12 --> 9733.240000000002
other people and flat would just like

9730.6 --> 9735.56
leave him just leave him talk [ __ ] to me

9733.24 --> 9737.92
and I didn't understand like why why you

9735.56 --> 9737.92
doing

9738.2 --> 9745.640000000001
that and it got really pissed

9741.88 --> 9749.08
off and then suddenly Nathan's doing the

9745.64 --> 9752.56
same thing leaving those really nasty

9749.08 --> 9755.319
trolls around like Charlie Welch it was

9752.56 --> 9758.199999999999
like a nasty troll for a decade like one

9755.319 --> 9760.439
of the first really bad people he just

9758.2 --> 9763.92
hangs around there now like nothing ever

9760.439 --> 9763.92
happened I I don't get

9764.359 --> 9768.319
it

9765.92 --> 9771.16
I just don't get

9768.319 --> 9774.64
it right and then I come in there say

9771.16 --> 9777.64
hello and you got like 10 minutes of

9774.64 --> 9780.519999999999
whining about oh look at the Baldi oh

9777.64 --> 9782.88
he's such a loser

9780.52 --> 9785.960000000001
like if that kind of thing would have

9782.88 --> 9789.16
been said to anybody they would have Ted

9785.96 --> 9794.24
them out anybody right well when they

9789.16 --> 9794.24
say it to me they don't I I don't get

9794.279 --> 9800.359
it

9795.96 --> 9802.759999999998
I really like it's it's just really

9800.359 --> 9806.84
really

9802.76 --> 9806.84
unfair and I can't deal with

9813.279 --> 9818.960000000001
that not what went on between me well

9817.92 --> 9821.68
he's

9818.96 --> 9824.278999999999
just started out look the whole

9821.68 --> 9826.880000000001
homophobia and all that like it's so

9824.279 --> 9829.439
unacceptable that I shame people with

9826.88 --> 9833.88
gayness or whatever for half a joke of

9829.439 --> 9833.880000000001
it and sometimes not so much

9834.0 --> 9839.279
right Nathan begging for flat soid

9836.68 --> 9842.56
attention is

9839.279 --> 9842.560000000001
he that's

9854.2 --> 9858.399000000001
weird

9855.84 --> 9860.319
I think flatso just wants to do his own

9858.399 --> 9864.96
thing and he should I

9860.319 --> 9867.08
mean flatso is doing pretty well I'd say

9864.96 --> 9870.278999999999
I mean yeah it's kind of trashy and all

9867.08 --> 9873.479
that it's not my thing he has trashy

9870.279 --> 9876.24
people around him he

9873.479 --> 9879.438999999998
does and he's inaudible but I mean that

9876.24 --> 9881.56
yeah that can't be helped but I mean

9879.439 --> 9884.2
he's not a nice person yeah I I agree I

9881.56 --> 9886.8
don't think he's a nice person but I

9884.2 --> 9890.439
mean he like with his show he is doing

9886.8 --> 9892.64
okay it's like yeah decently working and

9890.439 --> 9895.359
he got a crowd and including a lot of

9892.64 --> 9899.039999999999
trolls but I mean flat soy doesn't

9895.359 --> 9901.52
really need anybody else like that he's

9899.04 --> 9903.84
just doing his own thing and it's

9901.52 --> 9906.04
working and he likes to review videos

9903.84 --> 9910.279
like every other damn flat earther on

9906.04 --> 9911.880000000001
YouTube ever except me and like he

9910.279 --> 9914.479000000001
doesn't really need anybody and I think

9911.88 --> 9916.399
he's like kind of wey of what's

9914.479 --> 9919.319
Happening Now there and he's just like I

9916.399 --> 9922.319
just want to do this thing and you can

9919.319 --> 9926.84
do whatever I'm not going

9922.319 --> 9931.399
anywhere right which is really you think

9926.84 --> 9933.92
about it a very smart thing of him so

9931.399 --> 9935.84
yeah there's things about flaty I really

9933.92 --> 9939.12
don't like but there are things that I

9935.84 --> 9939.12
do respect about

9941.96 --> 9946.759999999998
him one of those things definitely isn't

9944.52 --> 9951.0
his ail but I mean yeah

9946.76 --> 9955.04
that's never mind about that

9951.0 --> 9959.16
right but yeah I am a different type of

9955.04 --> 9962.560000000001
person I'm very sensitive I'm open and I

9959.16 --> 9963.439
am very concerned about social matters I

9962.56 --> 9966.519999999999
just

9963.439 --> 9969.479000000001
am and I feel actually pretty good that

9966.52 --> 9970.6
I can just now talk about it for a bit

9969.479 --> 9973.278999999999
with you

9970.6 --> 9976.640000000001
guys because this [ __ ] is like it's

9973.279 --> 9980.12
wearing on me man like I need to talk

9976.64 --> 9982.358999999999
about this I feel like my community is

9980.12 --> 9984.880000000001
falling apart and I'm like really

9982.359 --> 9988.12
desperate like who will you please stay

9984.88 --> 9990.56
around please don't go there's more we

9988.12 --> 9992.76
can talk about there's more we can learn

9990.56 --> 9994.399
and I want to see what can be remedied

9992.76 --> 9998.16
like I'm I'm

9994.399 --> 10000.519999999999
worried about the Flat Earth community

9998.16 --> 10003.319
that I've been part of like even if they

10000.52 --> 10005.52
kick me out I'm still worried I'm still

10003.319 --> 10008.64
worried about them it's like

10005.52 --> 10011.08
getting in an argument with your

10008.64 --> 10013.399
family your parents and they kick you

10011.08 --> 10015.279
out but yeah they're still your family

10013.399 --> 10016.88
like I'm still worried like I do don't

10015.279 --> 10019.24
want them all to die or anything

10016.88 --> 10021.72
absolutely not like I'm

10019.24 --> 10025.039999999999
worried it's going to hurt for all yeah

10021.72 --> 10025.039999999999
I know it

10033.359 --> 10038.84
is selling knowingly broken things what

10037.279 --> 10040.16
what are you talking about Steve Bronson

10038.84 --> 10043.0
what are you talking I don't know what

10040.16 --> 10043.0
you're talking about

10046.359 --> 10054.800000000001
there FB really been shaken up to start

10051.319 --> 10058.76
2024 yes Richard G I'm really noticing

10054.8 --> 10061.88
that which is also suspect right why is

10058.76 --> 10066.92
it suspect cuz it's an American election

10061.88 --> 10066.92
year that's kind of suspect

10068.399 --> 10073.08
like there is a correlation

10071.16 --> 10076.08
somehow

10073.08 --> 10078.64
with the government like who the group

10076.08 --> 10080.08
that is in power has some kind of

10078.64 --> 10082.88
indirect

10080.08 --> 10085.0
influence on Flat Earth community and

10082.88 --> 10085.72
what happens in I've just noticed this

10085.0 --> 10088.72
the

10085.72 --> 10088.72
correlation

10093.8 --> 10100.84
right

10096.359 --> 10101.84
like 2016 to 2020 has been like a really

10100.84 --> 10105.72
strong

10101.84 --> 10107.319
period for Flat Earth but then it all

10105.72 --> 10110.438999999998
went

10107.319 --> 10112.399
wrong with the yeah the the corona

10110.439 --> 10115.2
crisis blah blah blah you know what

10112.399 --> 10118.358999999999
happened and was tougher we still liveed

10115.2 --> 10122.439
through that but now 2024 is like a new

10118.359 --> 10124.960000000001
year and it's like something else is

10122.439 --> 10128.2
happening and I just noticed like

10124.96 --> 10128.199999999999
everything's becoming

10132.04 --> 10136.68
bitter and it's like more

10134.96 --> 10142.08
friction

10136.68 --> 10142.08
more envy and

10142.56 --> 10146.76
like

10144.12 --> 10149.800000000001
dissatisfaction type feelings and it's

10146.76 --> 10150.960000000001
very worrisome get together with Riley

10149.8 --> 10153.72
Neil

10150.96 --> 10156.72
[Music]

10153.72 --> 10156.72
really

10156.92 --> 10161.8
Neil doesn't like how he spoken to at

10158.96 --> 10163.479
fed I don't think he's ever going to

10161.8 --> 10168.0
talk to me

10163.479 --> 10171.72
again so Neil despises

10168.0 --> 10173.0
me dear little RI comes to mind I forgot

10171.72 --> 10177.519999999999

10286.399 --> 10292.319
I'm getting used to it though I'm

10289.2 --> 10296.359
getting over it better than when I broke

10292.319 --> 10297.84
up with my ex cuz man that was tough

10296.359 --> 10300.800000000001

10300.8 --> 10305.16
with her like the whole

10303.56 --> 10307.319
time

10305.16 --> 10310.439
so that that was way tougher to be

10307.319 --> 10312.92
forced to I didn't leave her she kicked

10310.439 --> 10314.960000000001

10318.84 --> 10323.8
just please don't make me

10321.12 --> 10325.68
go and that yeah when they still do that

10323.8 --> 10328.92
that's just like

10325.68 --> 10332.08
mortifying it's not that bad but I mean

10328.92 --> 10335.6
it has been longer I only spent 3 years

10332.08 --> 10339.8
with that girl right and amazing 3 years

10335.6 --> 10343.279
really ecstatic and exciting and

10339.8 --> 10346.96
just amazing but with these guys have

10343.279 --> 10348.52
spent like 10 years or

10346.96 --> 10351.0
something

10348.52 --> 10355.0
nine like eight to nine

10351.0 --> 10357.12
years and it's longer it's multiple

10355.0 --> 10359.479
people and it was really like a

10357.12 --> 10361.76
Brotherhood I mean I really saw us is

10359.479 --> 10363.399
like we are like the a council of

10361.76 --> 10364.92
wizards we are like these Flat Earth

10363.399 --> 10367.439
wizards we are working out these

10364.92 --> 10369.319
technicals and it's amazing it's a great

10367.439 --> 10371.319
honor to be part of that and it did

10369.319 --> 10373.96
absolutely feel like

10371.319 --> 10376.519999999999
that yeah long-term breakup take

10373.96 --> 10378.399
long-term recovery

10376.52 --> 10381.68
yeah it

10378.399 --> 10383.358999999999
sucks and I really wish that that it

10381.68 --> 10387.2
wouldn't have to be like that that we

10383.359 --> 10390.08
could still be friends it's like dude I

10387.2 --> 10393.0
mean Anthony Riley isn't there all the

10390.08 --> 10395.279
time he just pops by every now and then

10393.0 --> 10397.16
why couldn't I just do that

10395.279 --> 10400.960000000001
why can't I just pop by every now and

10397.16 --> 10403.479
then without just being and Neil like oh

10400.96 --> 10405.0
arwi is here I'm not I'm out of here

10403.479 --> 10407.519999999999
every time I show up Neil just

10405.0 --> 10408.84
immediately goes away and that's also

10407.52 --> 10411.239
why I'm saying like yeah I'm not going

10408.84 --> 10417.68
to get together with Riley and Neil like

10411.239 --> 10417.68
Neil despises me guys despises

10418.239 --> 10426.359
me he says like oh I really care for you

10421.279 --> 10426.359
he doesn't he [ __ ] despises me

10428.479 --> 10436.08
and I I've caught him multiple times

10431.68 --> 10438.92
talking total [ __ ] about me in troll

10436.08 --> 10441.479
forms through other people I don't

10438.92 --> 10445.319
actually go there so it's

10441.479 --> 10448.239
like it's what it is but Anthony Riley

10445.319 --> 10448.239
yeah I could talk with

10449.2 --> 10453.04
him we go way

10453.279 --> 10456.279
back

10456.88 --> 10460.759999999998
and Tony is a really good

10465.56 --> 10472.72
guy well debatable

10469.08 --> 10472.72
D ghostly

10474.76 --> 10479.479
bking I feel so much better now that

10477.279 --> 10483.279
I've talked about this I think that was

10479.479 --> 10486.278999999999
like it was like really brooding on

10483.279 --> 10486.279
me

10495.37 --> 10498.509
[Music]

10501.3 --> 10510.979
[Music]

10519.05 --> 10523.019999999999
[Music]

10524.08 --> 10527.52
I'm going to actually put it in the

10525.92 --> 10530.52
title I'm going to call it the fall of

10527.52 --> 10532.04
the wizard tower because it is what it

10530.52 --> 10534.720000000001
feels

10532.04 --> 10537.52
like and I mean this is now the main

10534.72 --> 10539.08
subject and again I really hope that

10537.52 --> 10541.359
none of them like see it as

10539.08 --> 10544.88
disrespectful I

10541.359 --> 10548.319
really I never meant that

10544.88 --> 10550.239
and in ways I will always honor the

10548.319 --> 10555.239
memory of

10550.239 --> 10558.399
it I never talk [ __ ] about my exes

10555.239 --> 10560.68
either any donations today I don't

10558.399 --> 10563.039999999999

10591.319 --> 10594.96
friend as you say then he's it's at

10593.279 --> 10597.640000000001
least been the

10594.96 --> 10598.759999999998
custodian he's been the one that's like

10597.64 --> 10602.399
kept us

10598.76 --> 10602.399
all together like

10603.08 --> 10606.08

10692.12 --> 10695.92
okay Steve Bronson take it easy

10697.76 --> 10703.0
there I don't know about the dishonesty

10700.479 --> 10706.119999999999
there I'm not

10703.0 --> 10708.399
sure but I don't want to yeah I know

10706.12 --> 10710.279
it's your opportunity to throw that I

10708.399 --> 10713.8
guess you've been sitting on a lot of

10710.279 --> 10716.720000000001
that multiple people have it's just that

10713.8 --> 10719.72
I there no message for me

10716.72 --> 10725.92
though right Nathan is how he is he does

10719.72 --> 10725.92
it his own way and if that is a little

10727.68 --> 10735.56
cold in a way then that's his that's how

10731.72 --> 10735.56
he is that's how he does it I

10735.8 --> 10741.96
mean he probably doesn't have any other

10738.479 --> 10743.519999999999
way to do it and like I don't want to

10741.96 --> 10746.438999999998
criticize him for

10743.52 --> 10749.52
that like this is not like oh it's all

10746.439 --> 10752.359
their fault they did it

10749.52 --> 10754.76
no I hope that's not the impression I've

10752.359 --> 10759.439
given you guys right I'm not saying like

10754.76 --> 10761.960000000001
it's all their fault no it's just that

10759.439 --> 10763.16
it's Grown Apart and I don't understand

10761.96 --> 10765.64
it

10763.16 --> 10768.399
anymore I don't understand what's going

10765.64 --> 10768.399
on

10769.2 --> 10775.279
why but I agree that

10772.359 --> 10779.12
Riley is just he gets a little

10775.279 --> 10781.16
passionate and then like Rowdy about

10779.12 --> 10783.720000000001
it and

10781.16 --> 10785.08
he yeah he just has moods every now and

10783.72 --> 10787.278999999999
then

10785.08 --> 10792.16
but there's other stuff that's gone on

10787.279 --> 10794.12
as well and like I heard FIA that Ry had

10792.16 --> 10797.8
some real serious

10794.12 --> 10800.880000000001
objections that he had like a a

10797.8 --> 10803.399
protest in certain things towards fed

10800.88 --> 10805.399
and I kind of want to hear about it

10803.399 --> 10808.319
though I really hope that maybe one day

10805.399 --> 10811.399
he's going to call into my show or just

10808.319 --> 10812.76
call me personally over Skype I want to

10811.399 --> 10815.76
talk about

10812.76 --> 10815.76
it

10817.6 --> 10821.960000000001
maybe like he would like to join my

10820.399 --> 10825.96
early bird

10821.96 --> 10825.96
chat I'd love to have him

10830.96 --> 10838.239
around yeah but Steve Bronson you're

10833.56 --> 10840.199999999999
emphasizing Nathan too much in this yeah

10838.239 --> 10843.279
when I'm talking about the wizard

10840.2 --> 10845.439
Council that's not Nathan you get it

10843.279 --> 10847.12
it's not just Nathan it's about the

10845.439 --> 10850.479000000001
whole

10847.12 --> 10853.439
group if it was just about Nathan I

10850.479 --> 10856.64
would say Nathan I

10853.439 --> 10858.92
didn't so please try to like keep that

10856.64 --> 10861.72
in mind as you keep responding it I'm

10858.92 --> 10864.239
not just talking about

10861.72 --> 10865.8
Nathan it's not even really all that

10864.239 --> 10869.439
much about that it's about the whole

10865.8 --> 10869.438999999998
group like what's going

10872.64 --> 10875.64
on

10877.88 --> 10884.319
we'll

10879.12 --> 10884.319000000001
ask we'll ask what ethnic

10885.04 --> 10891.12
one group

10887.279 --> 10894.12
think well not group think but group

10891.12 --> 10894.12
effort

10897.16 --> 10902.92
though like we have a project we're all

10900.439 --> 10905.399
trying to contribute to the project in

10902.92 --> 10908.279
our own ways

10905.399 --> 10912.039999999999
like you got the math guys you got like

10908.279 --> 10914.239
the historical research guys and you got

10912.04 --> 10917.12
the psychology guys and I was kind of

10914.239 --> 10919.319
the psychology guy like that's what I'm

10917.12 --> 10919.319000000001
good

10920.6 --> 10925.359
at right is how I figured out like hey

10923.479 --> 10926.92
are they confession like this sounds

10925.359 --> 10929.52
like confessional

10926.92 --> 10933.12
debating that's like pretty much the

10929.52 --> 10935.279
last thing that I've contributed is that

10933.12 --> 10937.08
inside like hey this seems like they're

10935.279 --> 10939.720000000001
making a confession they're trying to

10937.08 --> 10941.6
debate something argue for an argument

10939.72 --> 10943.64
but then they as they're doing it

10941.6 --> 10946.92
undoing their entire argument leaving

10943.64 --> 10949.96
you with nothing but not realizing that

10946.92 --> 10951.479
that is what they're doing or not making

10949.96 --> 10954.64
it a very

10951.479 --> 10957.92
apparent still thinking that they made

10954.64 --> 10959.92
the right argument for it and I call

10957.92 --> 10963.399
that confessional debating it's kind of

10959.92 --> 10965.52
the last development that I've added to

10963.399 --> 10967.68
it fed and I'm very proud of that also

10965.52 --> 10972.6
of the name it's the best name right

10967.68 --> 10972.6
confessional debating it's a thing now

10980.56 --> 10984.319
so debatable

10985.12 --> 10992.479000000001
yeah yeah in this case that person is

10988.76 --> 10995.16
Neil Neil has not contributed

10992.479 --> 10998.0
[ __ ]

10995.16 --> 11000.439
like two actual arguments he has

10998.0 --> 11004.88
not sorry he just

11000.439 --> 11004.880000000001
didn't he he might even recognize

11009.96 --> 11016.72
it and to me it's still often just a

11012.84 --> 11016.72
puzzle like why the hell

11017.16 --> 11022.479
why anyway I don't want to like kick him

11020.76 --> 11024.359
or anything it's

11022.479 --> 11028.039999999999
just

11024.359 --> 11028.04
just a puzzle to me like

11033.88 --> 11038.88
why whole group knows where to find me

11037.04 --> 11042.560000000001
if I matter to them yeah but they're not

11038.88 --> 11045.479
coming here none of them they don't

11042.56 --> 11045.479
contact me

11049.12 --> 11055.04
nothing and in the last direct

11051.64 --> 11057.92
conversation I had I was really puzzled

11055.04 --> 11061.0
about that that's on that Monday members

11057.92 --> 11064.279
only stream after it was over they told

11061.0 --> 11066.319
me they didn't trust me anymore I didn't

11064.279 --> 11068.399000000001
even understand what the hell that meant

11066.319 --> 11070.68
like about

11068.399 --> 11073.519999999999
what they didn't even

11070.68 --> 11075.0
tell like I was just like what the [ __ ]

11073.52 --> 11079.279
is going on

11075.0 --> 11079.279
here what the hell are you talking

11082.359 --> 11085.359
about

11101.68 --> 11106.08
yes Steve Bronson I appreciate it I

11103.479 --> 11106.08

11127.2 --> 11131.0

11131.0 --> 11136.04
however like the first hour and a half

11132.96 --> 11136.039999999999

11247.04 --> 11253.2
see

11248.64 --> 11253.199999999999
you bit late but uh

11262.12 --> 11265.12
yeah

11273.71 --> 11282.099999999999
[Music]

11292.04 --> 11295.04
in

11306.2 --> 11310.84
and thank you for giving me this

11307.72 --> 11314.479
opportunity to just talk about

11310.84 --> 11314.479
this it's kind of

11315.72 --> 11319.76
therapy and it is Weighing on

11322.0 --> 11325.0
me

11329.72 --> 11335.119999999999
pretty late now yeah but for flatter

11331.52 --> 11335.12
Sage it's still morning though

11339.64 --> 11343.76
duper coffee is cold

11351.92 --> 11354.92
yuck

11381.92 --> 11384.92
for

11387.96 --> 11393.239
it's just so weird man comparing it like

11390.52 --> 11397.359
the wizard Council to

11393.239 --> 11401.96
FB and like thinking

11397.359 --> 11404.279
about Lord of the Rings right remember

11401.96 --> 11409.239
zuman was the leader of the wizard

11404.279 --> 11411.479000000001
Council and gandal was part of that

11409.239 --> 11413.88
and like

11411.479 --> 11416.679999999998
radagast all these

11413.88 --> 11419.88
others and they were like a consel and

11416.68 --> 11423.16
then it went wrong why did it go wrong

11419.88 --> 11427.438999999998
because San basically found a p Palante

11423.16 --> 11431.76
here and engaged with it and so the dark

11427.439 --> 11431.76
lord basically infected

11433.399 --> 11439.68
him it just feels

11436.0 --> 11439.68
similar it feels

11441.84 --> 11444.84
similar

11449.239 --> 11453.319
I can just feel it

11453.52 --> 11459.52
now maybe he was there a while right but

11456.72 --> 11461.64
I mean even in Lord of the Rings like it

11459.52 --> 11464.6
was there a while and even gandal said

11461.64 --> 11470.399
like I can't believe I didn't see this

11464.6 --> 11470.399000000001
earlier why did you hide this from me

11470.88 --> 11479.119999999999
right and it feels like like that I feel

11475.0 --> 11484.6
like I'm gnov and I just just found

11479.12 --> 11484.6
out that San is basically corrupted to

11491.08 --> 11497.439
saon got in a fight and then barely

11494.04 --> 11500.560000000001
escaped thanks to a Giant Eagle lifting

11497.439 --> 11500.56
him off the top of the

11501.76 --> 11504.76
tower

11521.359 --> 11528.960000000001
what where there Richard G Richard G is

11525.52 --> 11528.960000000001
there was there

11531.68 --> 11536.2
earlier

11534.239 --> 11539.279
and Gavin I don't know what the hell's

11536.2 --> 11542.359
up with Gavin he was acting really weird

11539.279 --> 11545.04
I noticed him in fed chat talking to

11542.359 --> 11548.279
teret and saying like oh maybe I should

11545.04 --> 11550.12
stay away like what the [ __ ] was that he

11548.279 --> 11552.560000000001
was right here in the chat and then

11550.12 --> 11556.12
suddenly I noticed him over there that

11552.56 --> 11558.278999999999
was just freaky so Gavin I don't know

11556.12 --> 11561.319000000001
man I don't know about him anymore it

11558.279 --> 11561.319000000001
just seems like

11561.64 --> 11566.319
he

11563.52 --> 11566.319000000001
is not super

11567.0 --> 11570.88
trustworthy I don't know what it is or

11568.92 --> 11572.6
maybe he's just too he can't handle the

11570.88 --> 11575.239
trolls that it could be

11572.6 --> 11577.279
that cuz everybody that likes to hang

11575.239 --> 11579.279
around here they're all as soon as you

11577.279 --> 11581.84
go over to Fed you're going to get

11579.279 --> 11583.560000000001
whining especially from teror oh you're

11581.84 --> 11587.239
hanging around with the

11583.56 --> 11590.92
racist so yeah that gets the

11587.239 --> 11593.52
people and Gavin B probably didn't sign

11590.92 --> 11596.0
on the to have that sort of [ __ ]

11593.52 --> 11596.0
happened to

11597.359 --> 11601.76
him as far as slowmo I don't know where

11599.96 --> 11604.319
he is he hasn't been here for a while I

11601.76 --> 11604.319
hope he's all

11614.04 --> 11621.04
right yeah flatter Sage yeah don't worry

11617.279 --> 11621.04
you'll never be treated like that here

11621.56 --> 11624.56
ever

11627.84 --> 11633.12
and you can indeed have different

11630.239 --> 11636.96
beliefs as long as don't those different

11633.12 --> 11639.640000000001
beliefs don't lead you to toxic

11636.96 --> 11641.88
Behavior but I think you're pretty much

11639.64 --> 11641.88
all

11642.41 --> 11647.239
[Music]

11644.0 --> 11650.439
right screenshot and sending

11647.239 --> 11650.439
complain why

11650.52 --> 11657.68
duper I mean you could do that

11654.319 --> 11660.6
but like it's not stopping though

11657.68 --> 11662.68
right Neil has been doing this sort of

11660.6 --> 11665.68
[ __ ] for like over a

11662.68 --> 11671.84
year people send complaints to Nathan

11665.68 --> 11671.84
all the time and Neil's still doing it

11681.479 --> 11684.479
so

11685.22 --> 11692.84
[Music]

11687.84 --> 11692.84

talking about

11727.88 --> 11736.8

11732.76 --> 11740.68
thing Gavin B was talking to teret like

11736.8 --> 11744.119999999999
when he was talking in my chat and then

11740.68 --> 11745.92
suddenly I spotted him in Nathan's chat

11744.12 --> 11750.720000000001
talking to Teran and saying like maybe I

11745.92 --> 11754.16
won't come back there then at at rwis

11750.72 --> 11757.64
like what so I said what are you doing

11754.16 --> 11761.279
Gavin B that's all I like one sentence

11757.64 --> 11763.8
guess what happened I Neil timed me out

11761.279 --> 11763.800000000001
24

11764.16 --> 11769.96
hours like

11766.88 --> 11772.08
immediately just one comment got a bunch

11769.96 --> 11774.64
of complaints what are you doing here

11772.08 --> 11781.12
this disrupting the

11774.64 --> 11783.92
chat uh by saying one sentence

11781.12 --> 11788.239000000001
really addressing a person

11783.92 --> 11790.56
that's talking about me that is also

11788.239 --> 11794.08
happens to be in my live chat at the

11790.56 --> 11797.92
same time I'm disrupting the chat just

11794.08 --> 11800.12
saying hi I mean maybe next time I'll

11797.92 --> 11802.399
just say hi and let's see if they

11800.12 --> 11804.560000000001
immediately timee me out for disrupting

11802.399 --> 11804.56
the

11805.199 --> 11808.960000000001
chat it's just

11831.199 --> 11834.199
insanity

11841.13 --> 11847.08
[Applause]

11843.96 --> 11847.08
[Music]

11848.45 --> 11860.049
[Applause]

11849.16 --> 11860.048999999999
[Music]

11865.8 --> 11873.56
what are you talking about Neil letter

11868.8 --> 11877.479
Sage we you think so that yeah but

11873.56 --> 11880.56
no Neil knows he can't be that he

11877.479 --> 11883.64
doesn't aspire to be

11880.56 --> 11885.319
that I think he's just like acting very

11883.64 --> 11889.0
desperate

11885.319 --> 11891.119999999999
to he just wants to really please the

11889.0 --> 11894.12
Masa or

11891.12 --> 11894.12
something

11913.52 --> 11922.479000000001
lots of emails from trolls complaining

11915.359 --> 11925.960000000001
about Neil well duper he did get lots of

11922.479 --> 11929.72
emails of people not Trolls but actual

11925.96 --> 11932.759999999998
people complaining about Neil Neil still

11929.72 --> 11936.76
got a wrench though ah oh that's not a

11932.76 --> 11936.76
double standard at all at

11951.04 --> 11954.04
all

11959.08 --> 11964.96
oh low g h thank you it's themers us I

11963.84 --> 11967.6
wouldn't be

11964.96 --> 11970.239
surprised I mean I think the real ter

11967.6 --> 11970.239
probably just

11974.96 --> 11981.039999999999
gone as in left because he felt

11977.92 --> 11983.199
humiliated and just didn't want

11981.04 --> 11985.0
to

11983.199 --> 11988.359
deal with it

11985.0 --> 11993.04
anymore so yeah you might be right and

11988.359 --> 11993.04
hey that scumbag is like one of the

11993.08 --> 11997.039999999999
worst so thank you

12004.239 --> 12009.88
guys right but I mean that guy can keep

12006.96 --> 12012.16
trying I'll just keep kicking him out

12009.88 --> 12014.8
just like like oh you're just acting

12012.16 --> 12018.6
like a complete [ __ ] or you say things

12014.8 --> 12021.88
that are like totally

12018.6 --> 12025.52
nonsensical then yeah I'll just kick you

12021.88 --> 12029.039999999999
out just like slick Killa was obviously

12025.52 --> 12032.239
not a real person the most ridiculous

12029.04 --> 12032.239000000001
background story I've ever

12034.74 --> 12037.93
[Music]

12040.479 --> 12046.08
heard right but I

12043.439 --> 12049.199
mean in a way

12046.08 --> 12052.84
like it is still origin tera's original

12049.199 --> 12055.52
account that's hang around in fed

12052.84 --> 12058.92
though right so I'm not sure what's

12055.52 --> 12060.800000000001
going on exactly with that although it

12058.92 --> 12063.239
could be the fake teret because there

12060.8 --> 12066.519999999999
were like fake turet accounts that were

12063.239 --> 12066.52
identical to

12068.52 --> 12076.239
him so it might be the fake seriously

12072.76 --> 12080.319
that's actually never even realized that

12076.239 --> 12083.52
the terret 306 that's hanging around fed

12080.319 --> 12085.68
might be the fake terret

12083.52 --> 12088.199
account cuz when teret still had a

12085.68 --> 12090.0
wrench there were like other accounts

12088.199 --> 12091.960000000001
that were identical to his that then

12090.0 --> 12095.6
popped up without a wrench it's like

12091.96 --> 12098.039999999999
what the hell is this so those might

12095.6 --> 12100.76
be who we're dealing

12098.04 --> 12103.720000000001
with and it would also explain why he

12100.76 --> 12108.0
just never stops

12103.72 --> 12108.0
whining cuz he's like doing it on

12115.64 --> 12120.84
purpose really Richard you want to see

12128.279 --> 12133.76
that that's fine Richard it's fine

12145.08 --> 12151.12
I mean look if these guys are literally

12147.279 --> 12153.92
trading you like [ __ ] at fed chat for no

12151.12 --> 12157.279
damn reason I'm giving you some room to

12153.92 --> 12159.6
complain about it as long as you keep it

12157.279 --> 12162.399000000001
decent enough

12159.6 --> 12165.68
right and today is one of the show we're

12162.399 --> 12169.84
talking about we're talking about this

12165.68 --> 12172.720000000001
so it's fine they let trolls [ __ ] all

12169.84 --> 12175.84
over me and like ridicule me

12172.72 --> 12179.84
outright and they just let them hang

12175.84 --> 12182.960000000001
there which like I would never do

12179.84 --> 12185.239
that like if there's like these stupid

12182.96 --> 12187.839999999998
fake Nathan heads or

12185.239 --> 12189.72
whatever like fake sock accounts that

12187.84 --> 12193.199
have like Nathan's face on them really

12189.72 --> 12194.76
ugly and then come in and then talk [ __ ]

12193.199 --> 12197.439
about Nathan like I'm going to kick them

12194.76 --> 12200.319
out too because why I don't want that

12197.439 --> 12201.319
around it's it's just really annoying

12200.319 --> 12205.8
and

12201.319 --> 12208.439
gross and they don't over

12205.8 --> 12212.88
there when there's trolls that do that

12208.439 --> 12212.880000000001
with me so that's just like veryy

12213.12 --> 12216.880000000001
telling and if they're going to treat

12215.16 --> 12218.119999999999
you like [ __ ] because you like to hang

12216.88 --> 12220.92
around my

12218.12 --> 12222.560000000001
show then I'm giving you the right to

12220.92 --> 12225.08
complain about it

12222.56 --> 12227.72
here especially when it is the subject

12225.08 --> 12229.279
and that is now it is now the subject

12227.72 --> 12230.84
right yesterday I wouldn't have

12229.279 --> 12233.720000000001
tolerated it because it wasn't the

12230.84 --> 12235.479
subject we're talking about more Flat

12233.72 --> 12239.438999999998
Earth oriented

12235.479 --> 12242.239
and Mysteries of the world subjects but

12239.439 --> 12246.12
today we're talking about

12242.239 --> 12246.119999999999
this so don't worry about

12250.6 --> 12253.6
it

12255.399 --> 12261.84
anyway yeah g h thank you earlier for

12258.239 --> 12266.0
that comment you're saying ter is them

12261.84 --> 12270.08
us if you could basically get gather the

12266.0 --> 12272.88
proof of that and send it to Nathan to

12270.08 --> 12276.479
tell him like hey there's actually a

12272.88 --> 12280.64
fake teret 306 that's a fake teret it's

12276.479 --> 12282.96
not the original person it's this really

12280.64 --> 12285.16
shitty troll

12282.96 --> 12286.96
if you can actually like gather the

12285.16 --> 12288.92
evidence and send it to Nathan then

12286.96 --> 12290.039999999999
maybe Nathan will actually do something

12288.92 --> 12293.76
about

12290.04 --> 12293.76
it might be a good

12298.319 --> 12302.6
idea okay blue P Devolution I really

12300.84 --> 12304.8
appreciate welcome by the way good to

12302.6 --> 12304.800000000001
see

12309.12 --> 12313.479000000001
you I feel honored thank you

12316.359 --> 12319.68
it's always good to have you in my

12330.12 --> 12335.199
chat trying to make every an exclusively

12333.76 --> 12337.800000000001
Christian

12335.199 --> 12340.12
platform yeah dude and I mean that was a

12337.8 --> 12342.599999999999
whole struggle too before it all got

12340.12 --> 12345.640000000001
super bitter

12342.6 --> 12348.239
like I was trying to lay down like my

12345.64 --> 12352.198999999999
insight right like the path of Christ

12348.239 --> 12355.56
like I feel that the typical Priestly

12352.199 --> 12358.04
way that Christianity has been treated

12355.56 --> 12360.359
in the the

12358.04 --> 12362.960000000001
centuries through the church that that

12360.359 --> 12365.6
is like a corrupted version of the

12362.96 --> 12369.039999999999
original teachings of

12365.6 --> 12371.04
Christ and that it's like a distraction

12369.04 --> 12373.76
away from the original teachings of

12371.04 --> 12376.439
Christ and by the way like that idea is

12373.76 --> 12379.439
not even that unique you know I talked

12376.439 --> 12381.68
about that with like people out here

12379.439 --> 12384.6
that never even heard of our

12381.68 --> 12387.439
platforms that say like yeah that

12384.6 --> 12390.880000000001
actually really makes sense so it's like

12387.439 --> 12393.92
I wanted something with that and Adam me

12390.88 --> 12397.198999999999
was with me on that too and we were like

12393.92 --> 12399.56
in fed like that one Camp versus the

12397.199 --> 12402.319000000001
radical Christian Camp and they were

12399.56 --> 12405.8
always whining about it against us me

12402.319 --> 12408.439
and Adam and now it's like since I left

12405.8 --> 12411.278999999999
it almost seems like that struggle is

12408.439 --> 12414.08
over and I never hear Adam talking about

12411.279 --> 12418.439
it anymore

12414.08 --> 12421.439
ever it's like the radical Christians W

12418.439 --> 12424.04
and now they're just dictating

12421.439 --> 12425.720000000001
everything like oh oh you're against

12424.04 --> 12428.080000000002
this then I'm going to kick you out or

12425.72 --> 12429.76
I'm going to time you out till you stop

12428.08 --> 12432.0
talking about

12429.76 --> 12434.84
it that didn't happen happened before

12432.0 --> 12434.84
that before I

12444.439 --> 12447.960000000001
left man I really appreciate that

12446.76 --> 12451.84
comment L

12447.96 --> 12453.759999999998
Evolution I liked fed too for the

12451.84 --> 12457.439
information this show is more

12453.76 --> 12459.72
interesting I thank you for

12457.439 --> 12463.439
that sometimes I feel it's not very

12459.72 --> 12465.64
interesting but I do my best though and

12463.439 --> 12467.960000000001
hey yesterday show was great definitely

12465.64 --> 12470.88
recommend that if you haven't seen it

12467.96 --> 12470.88
yesterday was really

12490.239 --> 12493.239
great

12513.16 --> 12517.239
yeah flatter Sage yeah that was so weird

12517.8 --> 12525.319
man right but like like before the 500

12523.319 --> 12528.319
bucks are am out that was the whole

12525.319 --> 12530.319
thing it was like two days before that

12528.319 --> 12532.479
Nathan was saying those things basically

12530.319 --> 12534.119999999999
saying like we shouldn't exactly what

12532.479 --> 12537.039999999999
you're saying we shouldn't speculate

12534.12 --> 12539.359
about what we don't know for sure like

12537.04 --> 12543.720000000001
are you

12539.359 --> 12545.479000000001
serious that's that's like exactly what

12543.72 --> 12550.119999999999
I that's my

12545.479 --> 12553.119999999999
specialty like I shouldn't do that

12550.12 --> 12553.12
what

12557.08 --> 12562.56
what there is no proof it's just

12559.199 --> 12562.560000000001
something oh

12567.8 --> 12572.16
okay oh that's

12569.92 --> 12573.239
disappointing gas AG I thought you had

12572.16 --> 12576.68
actual

12573.239 --> 12579.96
evidence right okay so it could just be

12576.68 --> 12582.68
a bluff I mean trolls lie all the time

12579.96 --> 12585.96
even to the each other so hey Richard

12582.68 --> 12585.960000000001
regular Richard good to see

12591.96 --> 12598.919999999998

12598.92 --> 12604.359

monkey that's an Antonio suat

12852.72 --> 12858.8
phrase are you like a Antonio subat guy

12859.12 --> 12862.6
Sam rest in

12864.56 --> 12868.92
peace but that was what he always

12876.279 --> 12882.0
said you wish both sides would talk nice

12879.279 --> 12885.800000000001
to each other without the insult

12882.0 --> 12887.96
yeah I get that and hey some globers are

12885.8 --> 12890.8
respectful and then I don't call them

12887.96 --> 12894.16
barded or whatever right I don't I don't

12890.8 --> 12896.278999999999
address them as bards I rarely do that

12894.16 --> 12898.479
because it doesn't feel good but

12896.279 --> 12901.04
sometimes if I'm going to describe the

12898.479 --> 12903.319
process of them not getting it and

12901.04 --> 12906.239000000001
having a suspense of disbelief and and

12903.319 --> 12909.56
thinking presupposing is okay then I

12906.239 --> 12912.439
will describe that as ball tarded I

12909.56 --> 12913.96
won't say hey you're a balard because

12912.439 --> 12916.880000000001
that is kind of just a straight out

12913.96 --> 12918.198999999999
insult but I will say like yeah he just

12916.88 --> 12923.198999999999
suffering from

12918.199 --> 12923.199
barded right and I

12924.56 --> 12930.399
mean I could say they're suffering from

12927.16 --> 12933.119999999999
Globe belief but I just like bald

12930.399 --> 12936.72
heartedness

12933.12 --> 12936.720000000001
sorry I like that

12939.6 --> 12942.6
word

12944.68 --> 12951.6
definitely not [ __ ] either no but

12947.199 --> 12955.08
it's like look barded doesn't mean you

12951.6 --> 12957.56
are a complete [ __ ] it just means you

12955.08 --> 12959.6
have barded that means you have a very

12957.56 --> 12962.64
specific form of

12959.6 --> 12965.960000000001
retardation that's very narrow that

12962.64 --> 12970.239
probably won't affect your overall

12965.96 --> 12972.519999999999
competence in other regions of thought

12970.239 --> 12972.52
you

12978.8 --> 12984.039999999999
see like barded is like an aberration

12982.16 --> 12985.64
it's just this one region in which

12984.04 --> 12988.04
you're like kind of

12985.64 --> 12990.358999999999
dysfunctional that's how I see it and I

12988.04 --> 12992.84
call that barded it doesn't mean you're

12990.359 --> 12995.239
a total [ __ ] in everything you think

12992.84 --> 12997.960000000001
it's just in that thing it's just like

12995.239 --> 12999.8
yeah you do weird things like you're not

12997.96 --> 13001.399
supposed to do that but you've been

12999.8 --> 13004.198999999999
taught that that's

13001.399 --> 13010.358999999999
okay specifically for

13004.199 --> 13010.359
that right so that's why I say

13019.359 --> 13025.880000000001
that Flur is short or flat earther

13023.12 --> 13033.0
though there is no insult there yeah it

13025.88 --> 13033.0
is though guys Flur is it the atory

13033.16 --> 13037.16
term and technically so is

13045.76 --> 13051.72
blur and I don't like those terms I I

13049.399 --> 13053.56
hate being called a Flur and I don't

13051.72 --> 13058.8
like calling people

13053.56 --> 13064.64
blur I think it's just like cheap

13058.8 --> 13064.64
or lower class language I don't like

13067.359 --> 13072.800000000001
it it's not a good side calling the

13070.08 --> 13075.239
other [ __ ] I don't call them

13072.8 --> 13077.0
[ __ ] I'm just saying like yeah they

13075.239 --> 13078.88
might be a very smart person but they

13077.0 --> 13082.279
suffer from bald

13078.88 --> 13086.16
heartedness which is a very common

13082.279 --> 13088.640000000001
ailment right majority the world is bald

13086.16 --> 13091.119999999999
hearted you couldn't help that you've

13088.64 --> 13094.0
been conditioned from a young child on

13091.12 --> 13096.880000000001
to do that told you that's okay it's

13094.0 --> 13098.64
okay to presuppose yeah it's the only

13096.88 --> 13103.198999999999
field of

13098.64 --> 13107.08
lore in like the entirety of knowledge

13103.199 --> 13110.479000000001
in which it's okay to presuppose yeah

13107.08 --> 13110.479
that should really tell you

13117.199 --> 13121.68
something like that's a bit tarded I'm

13119.92 --> 13124.72
sorry

13121.68 --> 13127.239
it's like oh everything is like it's

13124.72 --> 13129.119999999999
just like the same thing as like yeah

13127.239 --> 13130.56
man I'm really into conspiracies this

13129.12 --> 13133.439
and that and this and that and this

13130.56 --> 13135.68
there so many things and so many extreme

13133.439 --> 13139.84
conspiracies but still interesting but

13135.68 --> 13142.880000000001
the Earth being flat no no that's also

13139.84 --> 13146.279
like pretty [ __ ] really when you

13142.88 --> 13150.358999999999
think about it just at a distance yet it

13146.279 --> 13152.84
still happens they people do it I call

13150.359 --> 13154.68
that Bal heartedness it's very specific

13152.84 --> 13158.439
form

13154.68 --> 13158.439
of aberant

13159.319 --> 13165.399
thought it's like this weird hypocrisy

13162.359 --> 13168.08
that you if you are that can't see you

13165.399 --> 13170.399
can't see that that is H hypocritical

13168.08 --> 13173.239
that you work like that but you've been

13170.399 --> 13175.239
taught to do that most likely everybody

13173.239 --> 13176.6
accepts it when you do that they think

13175.239 --> 13177.88
that's the way you're supposed to do

13176.6 --> 13180.880000000001
that it's

13177.88 --> 13182.88
normal but it is very aberant if you

13180.88 --> 13185.839999999998
just look at it

13182.88 --> 13187.92
logically right but I don't want to

13185.84 --> 13190.279
further like I'm not I don't mean to

13187.92 --> 13192.88
insult you guys don't

13190.279 --> 13195.199
worry I'm just making a case for the

13192.88 --> 13200.399
word I like saying

13195.199 --> 13200.399000000001
that and it has a very specific

13202.96 --> 13209.16
function I've just hand with different

13205.92 --> 13212.16
stuffs that you have FPS

13209.16 --> 13212.16
okay

13212.319 --> 13219.519999999999
measured flat what was it measured using

13215.56 --> 13222.84
an angle to a flat Baseline

13219.52 --> 13226.12
gas really you're going to open up the

13222.84 --> 13226.12
can are

13233.04 --> 13238.76
you

13234.76 --> 13243.0
yeah this is stupid yeah just because

13238.76 --> 13245.359
you can make a circle around the GP

13243.0 --> 13246.04
doesn't mean that when you actually do

13245.359 --> 13248.56
the

13246.04 --> 13250.84
measurement you're oh you're taking a

13248.56 --> 13254.439
circle around what you're seeing no

13250.84 --> 13257.76
you're measuring a straight

13254.439 --> 13262.92
line over the Flat

13257.76 --> 13265.960000000001
Earth to the GP Point underneath the

13262.92 --> 13269.16
celestial body that's what you

13265.96 --> 13272.919999999998
practically do you don't oh I see the

13269.16 --> 13276.239
star there oh quickly draw a circle

13272.92 --> 13277.92
around it no that's not what you do you

13276.239 --> 13282.479
take an

13277.92 --> 13286.319
angle an angle being two straight

13282.479 --> 13290.56
lines one of them being over the Flat

13286.319 --> 13295.64
Earth a straight line towards the

13290.56 --> 13302.039999999999
horizon to where the GP is of that star

13295.64 --> 13302.039999999999
over a flat Baseline yeah

13302.439 --> 13309.0
just because you can in your head draw a

13306.08 --> 13311.399
circle around a GP point doesn't mean

13309.0 --> 13315.12
that that is what you actually

13311.399 --> 13318.0
do when you measure the

13315.12 --> 13321.720000000001
angle with a

13318.0 --> 13325.239
seon I mean I read that comment and it's

13321.72 --> 13327.64
ridiculous it is playing dumb blue P

13325.239 --> 13330.76
Evolution

13327.64 --> 13334.039999999999
definitely yeah there's no Celestial

13330.76 --> 13338.04
Navigator ever took a

13334.04 --> 13342.080000000002
seant and then like oh yes oh I'm aiming

13338.04 --> 13346.439
it at the star or the Sun and oh yeah uh

13342.08 --> 13350.319
I'm going to draw a circle underneath it

13346.439 --> 13354.12
what how the hell is no no you take an

13350.319 --> 13358.0
angle you take an angle which is two

13354.12 --> 13360.52
straight lines one of them being over

13358.0 --> 13363.8
the Flat Earth a straight line not a

13360.52 --> 13366.560000000001
curved line that doesn't work yeah you

13363.8 --> 13368.92
don't oh draw a straight line and a

13366.56 --> 13371.119999999999
circle really how do you do that with a

13368.92 --> 13374.439
sexon where's where's this device where

13371.12 --> 13378.439
you can like make the circle no you take

13374.439 --> 13380.64
an angle to straight lines that's what

13378.439 --> 13380.64
you

13388.88 --> 13391.88
do

13392.04 --> 13396.880000000001
that's not the math or geometry that's

13394.08 --> 13399.279
used though yeah it is it is exactly

13396.88 --> 13401.88
what is used you take an angle two

13399.279 --> 13404.800000000001
straight lines intersecting at The

13401.88 --> 13406.039999999999
Observer that's exactly what you do

13404.8 --> 13409.479
don't draw a

13406.04 --> 13410.68
circle there's no Circle drawing in

13409.479 --> 13413.599999999999
Celestial

13410.68 --> 13415.68
navigation when you take the angle you

13413.6 --> 13418.479000000001
take the angle an angle being two

13415.68 --> 13421.199
straights line intersecting yeah

13418.479 --> 13423.96
straight lines intersecting angle

13421.199 --> 13427.52
straight lines not a circle there's no

13423.96 --> 13430.919999999998
Circle involved when you take an angle

13427.52 --> 13433.08
you can theoretically do that with math

13430.92 --> 13435.72
and all that but when you actually do

13433.08 --> 13438.88
Celestial navigation you take an angle

13435.72 --> 13443.88
you don't draw a circle you take an

13438.88 --> 13448.159
angle which is two straight lines

13443.88 --> 13451.239
intersecting yeah the bottom line being

13448.159 --> 13452.56
the base line

13451.239 --> 13454.239
and a

13452.56 --> 13457.8
baseline

13454.239 --> 13460.119999999999
doesn't you can't even calculate that

13457.8 --> 13461.198999999999
over a curved surface it only works on

13460.12 --> 13466.04
the Flat

13461.199 --> 13470.12
Earth yeah two straight lines yeah you

13466.04 --> 13472.399000000001
don't take a curved triangle you don't

13470.12 --> 13475.239000000001
take a curved

13472.399 --> 13477.119999999999
angle yeah when you do that you can

13475.239 --> 13479.52
presuppose you're taking a curved angle

13477.12 --> 13481.52
by saying yeah but my sight is being

13479.52 --> 13483.399000000001
curv C by terrestrial refraction or

13481.52 --> 13485.92
something yeah but that doesn't actually

13483.399 --> 13487.84
exist it's not official it's a

13485.92 --> 13488.92
mathematical construct it has nothing to

13487.84 --> 13492.92
do with

13488.92 --> 13495.56
Optics and they never used it what they

13492.92 --> 13498.68
do use is a

13495.56 --> 13503.278999999999
sexon like a mirror thingy and then you

13498.68 --> 13505.56
take an angle to the celestial body and

13503.279 --> 13508.52
to the Horizon with some

13505.56 --> 13514.278999999999
correction and that angle consists of

13508.52 --> 13515.960000000001
two STP great lines the bottom one being

13514.279 --> 13519.92
the base

13515.96 --> 13524.438999999998
line which you can't do over a curved

13519.92 --> 13524.439
surface it only works over a flat

13526.479 --> 13533.159
Earth what do you do with the angle you

13529.8 --> 13533.159
take it take the

13534.92 --> 13540.279
angle you can't do that over a curved

13538.68 --> 13541.84
surface

13540.279 --> 13544.560000000001
yeah you take the

13541.84 --> 13547.8
angle not over a curved

13544.56 --> 13550.278999999999
surface now what you do in your math

13547.8 --> 13552.599999999999
project or whatever with your barded

13550.279 --> 13556.08
model afterward that's your [ __ ]

13552.6 --> 13559.52
business but when you take the angle you

13556.08 --> 13561.88
take two straight lines one of them

13559.52 --> 13565.560000000001
being the Bas

13561.88 --> 13567.438999999998
line and you can't take a Bas line over

13565.56 --> 13570.479
a curved

13567.439 --> 13573.399
surface doesn't work

13570.479 --> 13573.399
that's not part of the

13580.479 --> 13586.159
measurement right

13583.0 --> 13587.359
so anybody watching this is why I call

13586.159 --> 13589.8
them

13587.359 --> 13592.92
barded CU this is what

13589.8 --> 13596.759999999998
happens this rudimentary logic and

13592.92 --> 13601.239
they'll like make up a whole nonsense

13596.76 --> 13602.68
story of taking a circle over a sphere

13601.239 --> 13604.6
and that's

13602.68 --> 13607.159
absolutely

13604.6 --> 13610.56
nothing that has nothing to do with what

13607.159 --> 13613.119999999999
really happens yeah that's not how

13610.56 --> 13616.359
Celestial navigation works it's not what

13613.12 --> 13621.560000000001
you do with a seant you take an angle

13616.359 --> 13624.52
and an angle is two straight lines

13621.56 --> 13628.119999999999
intersecting that's an angle there's no

13624.52 --> 13632.880000000001
curve involved in that and you can't

13628.12 --> 13634.960000000001
take an angle to a curve Baseline that's

13632.88 --> 13639.319
mathematically

13634.96 --> 13642.88
impossible yeah and you don't take a

13639.319 --> 13645.439
circle and you don't take curved lines

13642.88 --> 13648.679999999998
with your angle you take two straight

13645.439 --> 13651.800000000001
lines straight lines intersecting one of

13648.68 --> 13651.800000000001
them being the base

13651.84 --> 13656.279
line

13653.56 --> 13658.56
yeah that's what really

13656.279 --> 13660.92
happens what's next after you take an

13658.56 --> 13663.479
angle you establish that you can only

13660.92 --> 13666.6
take an angle over a flat Earth that's

13663.479 --> 13669.119999999999
what's next it's the realization like

13666.6 --> 13671.68
who dude I just took an angle to the

13669.12 --> 13674.0
Horizon that only works if the Earth is

13671.68 --> 13677.159
flat yeah that's what you do next you

13674.0 --> 13680.56
got it that's what you do next you

13677.159 --> 13683.84
realize that the Earth is [ __ ] flat

13680.56 --> 13686.439
[ __ ] that's what you do next unless

13683.84 --> 13692.0
you're a [ __ ]

13686.439 --> 13692.0
ballart that's barded and can Let It

13712.12 --> 13718.800000000001
Go no I just told you you realize that

13716.239 --> 13720.0
that only works on a flat Earth and that

13718.8 --> 13722.479
the Earth is

13720.0 --> 13724.399
flat that's what you do

13722.479 --> 13727.198999999999
next

13724.399 --> 13728.08
yeah and where you then try to establish

13727.199 --> 13731.0
you

13728.08 --> 13735.039999999999
are with the celestial

13731.0 --> 13737.88
Maps I don't give a [ __ ] what you do

13735.04 --> 13740.720000000001
next what I do next after I've done that

13737.88 --> 13743.72
is realize that that only works because

13740.72 --> 13747.08
the Earth is flat and you can't take an

13743.72 --> 13750.159
angle to a curve Baseline ever that's

13747.08 --> 13754.12
mathematically impossible yeah no more

13750.159 --> 13759.52
knowledge or actions require for that

13754.12 --> 13759.52
realization the Earth is measured

13771.3 --> 13776.358999999999
[Music]

13773.8 --> 13778.56
flat totally dodging the question no I'm

13776.359 --> 13779.720000000001
not dodging the question you're dodging

13778.56 --> 13783.84
the answer d

13779.72 --> 13789.679999999998
[Music]

13783.84 --> 13789.68
[ __ ] hey akumo virus oh the ball join

13791.12 --> 13796.720000000001
in easy to take an angle to a point on a

13794.68 --> 13798.76
curve yeah but that's not what you do

13796.72 --> 13802.198999999999
though you take a flat

13798.76 --> 13805.08
Baseline yeah not a point on a curve

13802.199 --> 13808.52
yeah you're not taking a point on a

13805.08 --> 13810.319
curve yeah you're not taking a line to

13808.52 --> 13812.479000000001
you

13810.319 --> 13817.64
the point on the presupposed curve and

13812.479 --> 13820.399
then nothing no it's an angle not oh a

13817.64 --> 13822.319
line to a point on an arbitrary whatever

13820.399 --> 13828.599999999999
you think is curved no that's what you

13822.319 --> 13832.0
do you have another line the line to the

13828.6 --> 13836.76
Horizon yeah a straight

13832.0 --> 13839.64
line that makes it an angle that you can

13836.76 --> 13841.68
do a lot of things with yeah yeah you

13839.64 --> 13844.84
can do a lot of things with an

13841.68 --> 13848.479000000001
angle yeah you don't just oh I'm taking

13844.84 --> 13851.68
a line to the star and that's it yeah

13848.479 --> 13854.76
just just taking that one line no no you

13851.68 --> 13858.92
definitely take another line another

13854.76 --> 13862.52
straight line to the Horizon yeah and

13858.92 --> 13864.960000000001
that makes it an angle

13862.52 --> 13867.560000000001
yeah that's how that

13864.96 --> 13870.759999999998
works yeah you don't just take oh one

13867.56 --> 13872.76
line to just a point I'm standing on and

13870.76 --> 13874.68
that's it right that that's the end of

13872.76 --> 13878.56
the celestial navigation just take that

13874.68 --> 13881.56
one line and like how do you know what

13878.56 --> 13885.96
how many angle what the angle is oh

13881.56 --> 13891.198999999999
yeah you have to take another

13885.96 --> 13893.96
line the other line to the Horizon and

13891.199 --> 13896.800000000001
now you got an angle now you got an

13893.96 --> 13899.358999999999
actual angle that you can measure and

13896.8 --> 13903.278999999999
then establish where you are yeah if you

13899.359 --> 13905.399000000001
just take that one line to a presupposed

13903.279 --> 13907.479000000001
curve you're standing on you don't have

13905.399 --> 13909.119999999999
anything you don't even have an angle

13907.479 --> 13912.08
you don't have degrees you don't have

13909.12 --> 13916.319000000001
anything you need to have that other

13912.08 --> 13918.64
line to actually be able to get an angle

13916.319 --> 13922.479
measurement H otherwise you don't have

13918.64 --> 13922.479
anything you don't have any

14011.12 --> 14013.399000000001

14021.72 --> 14027.479
life curve Baseline in Celestial

navigation yeah because there is no such

thing as a curved Baseline you can't

14029.08 --> 14034.359
take an angle to

14031.439 --> 14036.92
it it doesn't work yeah and you don't

14034.359 --> 14038.52
take an angle to an arbitrary line in

14036.92 --> 14042.08
the middle of the

14038.52 --> 14047.279
air you take it to the

Horizon to the Horizon The Horizon The

14047.279 --> 14053.84
Horizon that's what they do don't lie

14050.64 --> 14057.319
don't be a stinky filthy liar yeah

14053.84 --> 14058.8
Celestial navigation has the Horizon

14057.319 --> 14062.479
that's what they

14058.8 --> 14065.479
do Celestial body Horizon

14062.479 --> 14068.278999999999
angle not an arbitrary point in the

14065.479 --> 14072.08
middle of the air The

14072.08 --> 14077.479
arbitrary point in the middle of the air

14073.96 --> 14080.278999999999
The Horizon you take an angle to the

14077.479 --> 14082.56
Horizon and the Celestial body not an

14080.279 --> 14085.439
arbitrary point in the middle of the air

14082.56 --> 14087.319
The Horizon yeah the Horizon that isn't

14085.439 --> 14090.68
geometric it's

14087.319 --> 14094.439
flat the Earth is flat you're taking a

14090.68 --> 14097.56
flat line to the Horizon the flat

14094.439 --> 14099.84
Baseline and then you take the line to

14097.56 --> 14102.479
the celestial body and now you have an

14099.84 --> 14104.12
angle and you can only do that because

14102.479 --> 14109.039999999999
the Earth is flat if the Earth was

14104.12 --> 14112.0
curved you couldn't take a angle to the

14109.04 --> 14114.92
Celestial body because you can't take an

14112.0 --> 14118.159
angle using a curved

14114.92 --> 14121.64
Baseline it doesn't work and you don't

14118.159 --> 14127.319
take an angle to an arbitrary point in

14121.64 --> 14127.319
the middle of the air you take it to the

14131.88 --> 14137.278999999999

you can do whatever the [ __ ] you want

14137.279 --> 14142.6
with all that [ __ ] data afterward I

14139.239 --> 14145.68
don't give a [ __ ] yeah the Earth is flat

14142.6 --> 14148.800000000001
it's measured flat Celestial navigation

14145.68 --> 14152.159
the starting process yeah of taking the

14148.8 --> 14154.88
angle it only works because the Earth is

14152.159 --> 14154.88
flat

14160.04 --> 14164.04
[ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ] what you do

14162.52 --> 14166.560000000001
with it afterward you can shove it up

14164.04 --> 14169.76
your ass you can shove that whole sexon

14166.56 --> 14172.8
up your ass I don't give a [ __ ] you take

14169.76 --> 14174.52
the angle and you can only do that

14172.8 --> 14177.438999999998
because the Earth is flat I don't give a

14174.52 --> 14177.439
[ __ ] what you do with it

14182.12 --> 14187.880000000001
afterward can a section work on an

14184.199 --> 14191.04
airplane yeah you know why because in an

14187.88 --> 14194.8
airplane there's also the

14191.04 --> 14199.080000000002
Horizon to take an angle too yeah cuz

14194.8 --> 14203.08
the Horizon Rises with you when you go

14199.08 --> 14206.0
up huh so it's very convenient it's very

14203.08 --> 14207.159
convenient CU you can then also take

14206.0 --> 14212.56
that

14207.159 --> 14215.6
angle over a flat Baseline towards the

14212.56 --> 14219.68
horizon cuz the Horizon moves up with

14215.6 --> 14220.960000000001
you when you go up huh yeah cuz the

14219.68 --> 14224.0
Earth is

14220.96 --> 14228.278999999999
flat yeah if it was a sphere and you

14224.0 --> 14230.96
went up Horizon would go down because

14228.279 --> 14233.439
the Horizon is geometric right it's a

14230.96 --> 14236.519999999999
geometry it's the it's the edge of a

14233.439 --> 14239.52
sphere yeah if you go up well the edge

14236.52 --> 14241.800000000001
of sphere go down yeah but it doesn't do

14239.52 --> 14243.92
that does it yeah because the Horizon

14241.8 --> 14246.278999999999
moves up with you you know why because

14243.92 --> 14250.479
the Earth is

14246.279 --> 14255.04
flat makes it very reliable for angle

14250.479 --> 14258.08
measurements to celestial bodies at any

14255.04 --> 14260.399000000001
height yeah at any height you go up all

14258.08 --> 14263.0
the horizon goes with you and by the way

14260.399 --> 14267.239
not just the Horizon the angle of the

14263.0 --> 14270.439
celestial body also moves with you up

14267.239 --> 14272.84
another mystery but it is the way it is

14270.439 --> 14275.359
that's why Celestial navigation in an

14272.84 --> 14278.12
airplane is

14275.359 --> 14282.08
identical to Celestial navigation on a

14278.12 --> 14284.239000000001
ship on the ocean it's identical yeah it

14282.08 --> 14287.239
doesn't work like that on a globe though

14284.239 --> 14289.279
cuz a globe has a physical geometry if

14287.239 --> 14291.399
you move up oh guess what all the

14289.279 --> 14292.960000000001
Horizon completely different oh wait all

14291.399 --> 14295.519999999999
the celestial bodies yeah they're

14292.96 --> 14297.96
different right there there real things

14295.52 --> 14299.76
physical things out there and now you're

14297.96 --> 14301.319
having a parallax effect oh you're

14299.76 --> 14304.12
having a different angle yeah but in

14301.319 --> 14307.439
reality you don't because Celestial

14304.12 --> 14307.439
navigation Works

14307.92 --> 14317.159
identical at every height at every

14312.239 --> 14317.159
height at every height it works

14317.52 --> 14321.279
identical

14320.479 --> 14324.319
what

14321.279 --> 14327.399000000001
happens an angle after you measure it

14324.319 --> 14329.56
you shove it up your ass hurry Cornwall

14327.399 --> 14331.519999999999
that's what you do after it you shove

14329.56 --> 14336.359
the angle up your

14331.52 --> 14339.359
ass yeah only works cuz the Earth is

14336.359 --> 14341.279
flat you can only take that angle

14339.359 --> 14344.640000000001
because the Earth is flat

afterward you can only take it you can

14385.439 --> 14390.960000000001
only take the measurement because the

only take that angle yeah because the

crap you can easily get an angle from a

glove no you can't because the globe is

14462.199 --> 14467.92
work you'd have to take the angle from

14465.6 --> 14470.800000000001
an arbitrary point in the middle of the

14467.92 --> 14473.960000000001
sky which is not what you do yeah you

14470.8 --> 14478.759999999998
take the angle to the

14473.96 --> 14482.759999999998
Horizon yeah the Horizon on the sphere

14478.76 --> 14485.6
well that would be a curve

14482.76 --> 14488.6
Baseline you can't do

14485.6 --> 14488.6
that

14488.72 --> 14495.08
error yeah you can only take that angle

14492.439 --> 14500.239
the Baseline is

14495.08 --> 14500.239
flat or you get an error

14511.68 --> 14514.799
[Music]

14516.479 --> 14521.479
ah maybe have some more of this crap

14518.319 --> 14524.64
tomorrow you Bunch your so you are so

14521.479 --> 14525.92
[ __ ] [ __ ] like just to say the

14524.64 --> 14528.92
word

14525.92 --> 14532.04
balard it's not sufficient

14528.92 --> 14536.439
an insult to how incredibly [ __ ]

14532.04 --> 14539.439
stupid you guys are you're mortifyingly

14536.439 --> 14539.439
[ __ ]

14539.92 --> 14545.960000000001
mortifying

14541.88 --> 14548.72
mortifyingly [ __ ]

14545.96 --> 14551.278999999999
yeah you're so [ __ ] stupid I've been

14548.72 --> 14552.96
saying a very rudimentary thing for like

14551.279 --> 14555.6
half an hour straight and you're all

14552.96 --> 14558.0
squirting like you're [ __ ]

14555.6 --> 14560.08
insane what what do you know next what

14558.0 --> 14561.92
do you do next you conclude the Earth is

14560.08 --> 14564.68
flat but you can't do that because

14561.92 --> 14564.68
you're [ __ ]

14580.08 --> 14583.08
[ __ ]

14584.52 --> 14590.319000000001
anymore just insulting them is not much

14587.359 --> 14593.720000000001
good oh giv [ __ ] carrots of fire it's

14590.319 --> 14593.72
not my [ __ ] problem you

14593.92 --> 14598.68
hear I'm telling them something really

14596.439 --> 14600.92
rudimentary and they're squirting like

14598.68 --> 14604.239
[ __ ]

14600.92 --> 14608.159
morons I will call them barded I will

14604.239 --> 14613.239
call them everything that comes to mind

14608.159 --> 14616.159
they deserve maximum insult

14613.239 --> 14618.6
maximum yeah but I won't tell them to

14616.159 --> 14621.399
kill themselves even though know

14618.6 --> 14626.239
sometimes I think like wow if I was that

14621.399 --> 14628.84
[ __ ] stupid then maybe yeah you know

14626.239 --> 14630.76
but I I won't do it don't worry I won't

14628.84 --> 14633.72
do it but I will call you [ __ ]

14630.76 --> 14637.12
[ __ ] though I will absolutely do

14633.72 --> 14637.119999999999
that because you

14641.83 --> 14644.92
[Music]

14647.0 --> 14650.0
are

14652.88 --> 14656.679999999998
what do you do with the measured angle

14654.92 --> 14658.239
what do you do with the measured angle

14656.68 --> 14661.359
what do you do with the measured angle

14658.239 --> 14661.359
chove it up your

14676.96 --> 14679.96
ass

14691.92 --> 14697.68
feels good to get that off your chest

14694.359 --> 14697.68
well glad you got it off your

14705.359 --> 14710.960000000001
chest I just can't believe you know

14708.56 --> 14714.0
like in 10 years these [ __ ] retards

14710.96 --> 14716.479
will do exactly the same it will still

14714.0 --> 14718.0
be what do you do with the angle what do

14716.479 --> 14719.96
you do with the angle oh that angle you

14718.0 --> 14722.76
can only attain because the Earth is

14719.96 --> 14724.239
flat that angle yeah I don't give a [ __ ]

14722.76 --> 14727.84
what you do with the angle you can shove

14724.239 --> 14730.68
it up your ass I don't care what you do

14727.84 --> 14733.960000000001
with it you can only get it because the

14730.68 --> 14737.08
Earth is flat dumbass I don't care what

14733.96 --> 14738.519999999999
you do with it you can only get it

14737.08 --> 14742.08
because the Earth is

14738.52 --> 14743.880000000001
flat I don't care what you do with it

14742.08 --> 14746.92
how many [ __ ] times do I need to tell

14743.88 --> 14750.239
you I don't care what you do with the

14746.92 --> 14752.88
angle you can only get the angle because

14750.239 --> 14752.88
the Earth is

14759.279 --> 14766.359
flat that's right there is no curve

14762.64 --> 14771.319
Baseline because the Earth is

14766.359 --> 14774.319
flat have you use geometry a lot

14771.319 --> 14774.319
yeah

14775.08 --> 14781.52
yeah I

14776.88 --> 14784.92
have one thing I know is that angles are

14781.52 --> 14786.84
straight lines intersecting I've

14784.92 --> 14788.68
explained for half an hour and you're

14786.84 --> 14792.239
still squirting on like a bunch of

14788.68 --> 14793.279
[ __ ] DED retards out there yeah still

14792.239 --> 14797.279
right

14793.279 --> 14799.359
now still right now like [ __ ] insane

14797.279 --> 14801.92
people

14799.359 --> 14803.76
insane

14801.92 --> 14807.88
people

14803.76 --> 14810.04
yeah oh Arin but you're talking so

14807.88 --> 14814.119999999999
aggressively yeah because I'm dealing

14810.04 --> 14817.199
with completely demented [ __ ]

14814.12 --> 14820.479000000001
freaks yeah who will not

14817.199 --> 14824.800000000001
listen you won't listen to

14820.479 --> 14827.56
rudimentary facts you won't listen no

14824.8 --> 14831.519999999999
matter how loud no many how no matter

14827.56 --> 14834.56
how many times you won't listen you're

14831.52 --> 14837.359
demented you're like provably in the

14834.56 --> 14841.72
moment provably

14837.359 --> 14845.52
demented about this

14841.72 --> 14849.278999999999
yeah this is not some complicated

14845.52 --> 14852.159
emotional based Amnesia or whatever I'm

14849.279 --> 14856.199
not threatening anybody I'm pointing

14852.159 --> 14858.359
out provable measurable

14856.199 --> 14860.560000000001
fact and all your you're doing is

14858.359 --> 14863.720000000001
avoiding it all you're doing is just

14860.56 --> 14866.198999999999
trying to go around it and oh but after

14863.72 --> 14867.72
you took that measurement of an angle

14866.199 --> 14869.84
which you can only do because the Earth

14867.72 --> 14872.118999999999
is flat after that oh I can still prove

14869.84 --> 14872.119
it's a

14872.68 --> 14876.68
globe

14874.56 --> 14881.08
[ __ ]

14876.68 --> 14885.359
DED and not some basic dementia really

14881.08 --> 14885.359
heavy heavy consistent

14885.6 --> 14890.159
dementia Bal heartedness is what it's

14896.8 --> 14903.039999999999
called you don't understand oh you don't

14900.08 --> 14905.439
understand yes we don't understand we

14903.04 --> 14907.92
don't understand that there is no

14905.439 --> 14910.239
communicating with you people you don't

14907.92 --> 14914.0
listen you don't

14910.239 --> 14916.56
care you're basically saying just stop

14914.0 --> 14919.359
just stop Arwin just stop saying it

14916.56 --> 14922.359
please just stop stop saying it the

14919.359 --> 14924.76
Earth is a ball stop saying it stop

14922.359 --> 14927.359
saying taking an angle stop saying you

14924.76 --> 14931.239
can't do that on a curved surface

14927.359 --> 14933.84
doesn't matter if it's demonstrable fact

14931.239 --> 14939.359
just stop saying it we can do it we

14933.84 --> 14942.68
can't do it we can't do it this this is

14939.359 --> 14945.800000000001
fear this is

14942.68 --> 14950.08
fear yeah that's you that's you in the

14945.8 --> 14950.08
chat you freaks you're

14952.8 --> 14956.159
freaks you're

14960.279 --> 14968.640000000001
freaks Satan owes your

mind he owns you he owns your mind

14968.64 --> 14975.439
you're lying you're lying to yourself

14972.72 --> 14979.519999999999
and you don't even realize it

14975.439 --> 14979.52
anymore he owns you

14989.319 --> 14993.84
holy [ __ ] shows have gone four hours

15002.59 --> 15005.68
[Music]

15006.439 --> 15009.439
already

15036.439 --> 15039.439
okay

15051.08 --> 15055.479
I'm going to have to add it to the title

15053.8 --> 15058.88
I mean this

15055.479 --> 15058.88
is very

15060.279 --> 15065.439
serious I didn't expect this to happen

15062.68 --> 15069.239
though it's it's kind of good to get a

15065.439 --> 15072.76
little riled up

15069.239 --> 15075.6
again might do it more often I mean at

15072.76 --> 15080.04
least I'm still doing it I can do

15075.6 --> 15081.960000000001
it it's just that I don't feel feel

15080.04 --> 15084.560000000001
really super comfortable you know in

15081.96 --> 15088.358999999999
these days I'm surprised I'm able to get

15084.56 --> 15090.0
it out of me that I'm not just like okay

15088.359 --> 15092.239
I'm ending the stream now it's [ __ ]

15090.0 --> 15095.88
ball tars I can't deal with this I can

15092.239 --> 15095.88
de with it and I have dealt with

15096.359 --> 15101.439
it

15099.0 --> 15103.52
I am dealing with it but I mean I'm

15101.439 --> 15107.359
definitely not going to tell you what

15103.52 --> 15109.560000000001
you do with that angle afterward because

15107.359 --> 15111.76
I don't care what you do with the angle

15109.56 --> 15114.08
afterward you could only take that angle

15111.76 --> 15116.56
because the Earth is flat and that's all

15114.08 --> 15120.08
as far as I'm willing to go I'm no

15116.56 --> 15123.96
longer interested after that point you

15120.08 --> 15129.279
see just not interested anymore can only

15123.96 --> 15129.278999999999
take that angle from a flat base

15142.199 --> 15148.960000000001
line yeah you can you take a line of

15146.84 --> 15151.56
sight to the Horizon and measure the

15148.96 --> 15155.919999999998
angle from that regardless of Earth

15151.56 --> 15158.278999999999
shape yeah but if the

15155.92 --> 15160.6
Horizon was

15158.279 --> 15164.399000000001
geometric that wouldn't

15160.6 --> 15166.68
work because then the angle would become

15164.399 --> 15168.96
super inconsistent yeah if you then go

15166.68 --> 15171.239
up then guess what The Horizon's

15168.96 --> 15173.039999999999
position angular wise would

15171.239 --> 15175.6
change

15173.04 --> 15178.319000000001
dramatically it would make Celestial

15175.6 --> 15182.720000000001
navigation completely

15178.319 --> 15186.159
impossible yeah however provably and

15182.72 --> 15190.239
officially when you move upward

15186.159 --> 15194.479
vertically Celestial navigation works

15190.239 --> 15196.96
exactly the same at any height that's an

15194.479 --> 15199.198999999999
officially registered

15196.96 --> 15201.8
confirmed

15199.199 --> 15205.08
statement yeah that's why Celestial

15201.8 --> 15208.56
navigation Works in Planes because the

15205.08 --> 15210.96
height doesn't matter if the Horizon

15208.56 --> 15215.96
were geometric that would make it

15210.96 --> 15219.159
completely impossible for that fact to

15215.96 --> 15219.159
pertain yeah

15219.56 --> 15226.039999999999
because if the Horizon is geometric then

15223.04 --> 15227.68
the height would make the angle

15226.04 --> 15230.239000000001
completely different there would be a

15227.68 --> 15232.960000000001
different form of celestial navigation

15230.239 --> 15236.6
at other height compared to at the

15232.96 --> 15239.399
ground but there isn't Celestial

15236.6 --> 15241.92
navigation is

15239.399 --> 15245.64
Universal at any

15241.92 --> 15249.08
height because the Earth is flat and the

15245.64 --> 15249.08
Horizon is not geometric

15258.84 --> 15261.84
Che

15276.08 --> 15279.08
ah

15352.76 --> 15357.880000000001
huh that was

15354.92 --> 15362.239
unexpected it's my friend from but I

15357.88 --> 15365.399
mean it's like half past 6 here I can't

15362.239 --> 15365.399
believe it's still light

15365.92 --> 15371.51
outside

15368.41 --> 15371.51
[Music]

15374.88 --> 15378.599999999999
[Music]

15376.199 --> 15380.880000000001
all right let's see let's see who I'm

15378.6 --> 15380.880000000001
going to

15383.199 --> 15389.439
unkick just oh yeah yeah if you bring up

15386.88 --> 15391.92
like [ __ ] retards like mun you're out

15389.439 --> 15391.92
of here

15395.52 --> 15401.239
immediately okay

15398.359 --> 15403.399000000001
Harry Cornwall the [ __ ] it's okay you

15401.239 --> 15407.039999999999
can be

15403.399 --> 15410.92
here I mean you never ever even speak up

15407.04 --> 15414.439
until there's some like yeah discussion

15410.92 --> 15416.88
like this is really [ __ ] annoying

15414.439 --> 15419.479000000001
I'll let you back in if you start like

15416.88 --> 15421.759999999998
mun challenge go [ __ ]

15419.479 --> 15423.278999999999
yourself seriously you're banned

15421.76 --> 15425.399
immediately you bring that [ __ ] up

15423.279 --> 15427.399000000001
you're out of here

15425.399 --> 15432.278999999999
immediately yeah I'm not going to do

15427.399 --> 15435.278999999999
some [ __ ] anti flat earther challenge

15432.279 --> 15435.279
ever

15449.6 --> 15456.0
ever yeah because it's all disingenuous

15453.88 --> 15458.839999999998
it's the same [ __ ] as what you're doing

15456.0 --> 15460.479
like you ball cards in the chat like

15458.84 --> 15462.359
he's just going to do the same thing

15460.479 --> 15464.599999999999
he's going to say like but what do you

15462.359 --> 15466.239
do with the angle after oh that angle

15464.6 --> 15468.359
you can only take because the Earth is

15466.239 --> 15470.6
flat I don't give a [ __ ] what you do

15468.359 --> 15473.479000000001
with the angle you can only take it

15470.6 --> 15477.960000000001
because the Earth is flat

15473.479 --> 15481.358999999999
yeah and it is a known accepted fact

15477.96 --> 15484.96
that Celestial navigation Works

15481.359 --> 15487.76
identical at any height why don't you

15484.96 --> 15490.278999999999
address that fact

15487.76 --> 15492.800000000001
you never have none of you ever even

15490.279 --> 15495.439
like responded to

15492.8 --> 15500.72
that yeah but it is a fact though it is

15495.439 --> 15504.56
an accepted used traditional fact that

15500.72 --> 15507.84
Celestial navigation is identical at any

15504.56 --> 15511.64
height yeah that's why airplanes don't

15507.84 --> 15517.399
have different Celestial navigation maps

15511.64 --> 15520.198999999999
as Oceanic ships they have the same map

15517.399 --> 15520.198999999999
the same

15520.92 --> 15528.199
tools yeah that can't work on a globe

15524.199 --> 15532.08
but I know you'll never address it

15528.199 --> 15537.199
ever yeah it is identical adjustment to

15532.08 --> 15540.6
relative that's not the same thing yeah

15537.199 --> 15544.399000000001
that yeah there's like a slight eye

15540.6 --> 15548.0
correction yeah slightly yeah I know

15544.399 --> 15549.84
about that one yeah but it wouldn't be

15548.0 --> 15552.6
just a slight ey height of eye

15549.84 --> 15555.319
correction thing it would be oh wait the

15552.6 --> 15558.56
Horizon is now at a completely different

15555.319 --> 15560.64
angle to these Stars you would have like

15558.56 --> 15564.118999999999
dramatic angle

15560.64 --> 15566.96
shifts at a different height you

15564.119 --> 15570.0
don't yeah the height of I correct oh

15566.96 --> 15573.039999999999
yeah maybe one degree slight correction

15570.0 --> 15575.6
yeah that's not all you'd need if the

15573.04 --> 15578.359
Earth was a globe and you'd like went up

15575.6 --> 15579.239
5 miles yeah no that's not what happens

15578.359 --> 15582.0
at

15579.239 --> 15585.88
all at

15582.0 --> 15588.88
all if the Horizon is geometric then the

15585.88 --> 15592.319
angle shift when you move vertically

15588.88 --> 15595.599999999999
would be dramatic so dramatic that you

15592.319 --> 15598.399
need completely different calculations

15595.6 --> 15600.439
and even a Celestial map to use with

15598.399 --> 15603.56
that it would be dramatically different

15600.439 --> 15607.0
you would have a different map for

15603.56 --> 15609.84
certain Heights you would and you don't

15607.0 --> 15612.88
they don't exist they're the same maps

15609.84 --> 15614.84
all you do is a slight angle correction

15612.88 --> 15617.159
that wouldn't be that wouldn't be

15614.84 --> 15620.8
sufficient if the Earth was a sphere you

15617.159 --> 15623.72
would need completely different

15620.8 --> 15626.96
Maps yeah completely

15623.72 --> 15629.84
different you don't you use the same

15626.96 --> 15632.319
map because the Earth is

15629.84 --> 15635.92
flat measured

15632.319 --> 15638.519999999999
calculated navigated flat and that's

15635.92 --> 15638.52
what it is

15641.44 --> 15644.589
[Music]

15644.72 --> 15647.438999999998
shut up

15665.439 --> 15668.439
guys

15681.439 --> 15686.479000000001
is problem oh really you're going to

15683.0 --> 15689.319
assault him you're going to add

15686.479 --> 15691.479
home no responses though to the actual

15689.319 --> 15694.0
argument put to the table you're not

15691.479 --> 15697.0
going to do that right so just go with

15694.0 --> 15700.52
the atom I mean that's fine right

15697.0 --> 15703.92
I mean I'll add har you after I given

15700.52 --> 15706.279
you an irrefutable argument but you can

15703.92 --> 15708.359
as a rebottle just try to add home your

15706.279 --> 15710.279
way out that's fine because you don't

15708.359 --> 15712.68
have a

15710.279 --> 15715.199
bottal then you can just say oh the

15712.68 --> 15717.6
source of your argumentation is

15715.199 --> 15720.6
ridiculous yeah but we lay down the

15717.6 --> 15724.04
argument and you don't have a rebuttal

15720.6 --> 15726.92
you can only try to move past it or go

15724.04 --> 15729.319000000001
oh your source is unreliable even though

15726.92 --> 15730.8
it's very clear what the argument is and

15729.319 --> 15732.359
you can't refute

15730.8 --> 15735.358999999999
it

15732.359 --> 15738.359
yeah if the Earth were a

15735.359 --> 15743.720000000001
sphere then Celestial navigation would

15738.359 --> 15747.800000000001
work dramatically different at different

15743.72 --> 15750.159
heights it isn't in reality dramatically

15747.8 --> 15752.679999999998
different at different heights because

15750.159 --> 15756.118999999999
the Earth isn't a

15752.68 --> 15760.56
sphere it's flat and because it's flat

15756.119 --> 15764.439
so Celestial navigation Works identical

15760.56 --> 15766.96
at any height identical just have to

15764.439 --> 15770.159
have slight eye correction height of eye

15766.96 --> 15772.519999999999
correction thing that's it that wouldn't

15770.159 --> 15774.359
suffice if the Earth was a sphere

15772.52 --> 15778.0
because the amount of Correction would

15774.359 --> 15780.68
be dramatically shifting all the time

15778.0 --> 15783.72
depending on your height it would be

15780.68 --> 15786.399
dramatically different in reality it

15783.72 --> 15789.519999999999
isn't it isn't dramatically different

15786.399 --> 15793.319
it's just a slight eye correction that's

15789.52 --> 15797.239
it the whole system everything else is

15793.319 --> 15801.08
identical you just need one map one

15797.239 --> 15806.239
Celestial map slight eye correction

15801.08 --> 15809.119
that's it that's all it is yeah no it is

15806.239 --> 15811.92
the map that is actually used Richard is

15809.119 --> 15816.04
identical you don't have another map

15811.92 --> 15818.64
that you're using yeah ey correction is

15816.04 --> 15821.399000000001
not not another map it's a slight

15818.64 --> 15824.239
correction it's not another map the map

15821.399 --> 15826.358999999999
that you use is identical yeah if the

15824.239 --> 15829.76
Earth was a sphere you wouldn't be able

15826.359 --> 15834.199
to use the same map with just a slight

15829.76 --> 15837.319
eye correction yeah you wouldn't it

15834.199 --> 15839.68
would be dramatically different in

15837.319 --> 15841.278999999999
reality it isn't dramatically different

15839.68 --> 15843.84
because the Earth is

15841.279 --> 15847.399000000001
flat we're different definition yeah no

15843.84 --> 15849.8
I just defined it balard

15847.399 --> 15854.358999999999
I just defined it for

15849.8 --> 15857.118999999999
you yeah I told you how it would be

15854.359 --> 15859.84
different

15857.119 --> 15861.640000000001
yeah right I'm rounding out the show

15859.84 --> 15863.439
because you guys are never going to stop

15861.64 --> 15865.198999999999
I could go on for another four [ __ ]

15863.439 --> 15868.6
hours and you just never stop You' just

15865.199 --> 15870.76
be puking and puking your lies and your

15868.6 --> 15871.439
retardedness over my chat and I'm done

15870.76 --> 15875.08
with

15871.439 --> 15876.960000000001
it so thanks everyone for coming hope
