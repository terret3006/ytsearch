kind of dreary it's a little bit more

83.52 --> 86.79899999999999
brighter than average

85.04 --> 88.4
right now in this moment but it's been

86.799 --> 92.0
pretty clouded

88.4 --> 95.36
and rain coming out of those clouds

92.0 --> 101.84
every now and then so it's kind of moist

95.36 --> 101.84
it's a little colder too than yesterday

102.799 --> 106.88000000000001
hence i'm wearing a sweater

110.0 --> 115.84
so yeah it's a bit of a gray day

116.32 --> 119.44999999999999
[Music]

120.0 --> 130.239
so it's

124.24 --> 130.239
thursday the 27th of may 2021

131.92 --> 140.39999999999998
a bit of a rough night

135.44 --> 140.4
my jaw was aching

140.84 --> 145.84
again and it's kind of kept me up a lot

143.84 --> 147.68
of the night

145.84 --> 149.52
it's really annoying yeah it happens

147.68 --> 152.72
every now and then to me so

149.52 --> 152.72
i'm used to that now

153.04 --> 162.0
thankfully i was able to call my healer

158.16 --> 162.0
an hour before the show started

162.56 --> 169.36
and yeah he helped me work through some

166.0 --> 172.239
things like that have been yeah

169.36 --> 174.0
weighing in on me in the last week

172.239 --> 176.48000000000002
because hey a lot of things happened in

174.0 --> 181.599
the last week

176.48 --> 181.599
a week or more put a lot of things down

182.8 --> 187.28
we're kind of heavy like the whole

185.519 --> 190.4
especially like the

187.28 --> 191.72
my idea but ideas about christ and kind

190.4 --> 194.56
of the rejection of

191.72 --> 198.08
trinitarians or rather not even

194.56 --> 203.519
trinitarians rather just

198.08 --> 203.519
typical convention

204.08 --> 207.36
with yeah all the side effects that come

206.48 --> 210.72
with that

207.36 --> 214.31900000000002
in the community and yeah it was really

210.72 --> 214.319
good to discuss that with him

215.2 --> 222.23899999999998
and yeah i was very supportive and that

218.799 --> 222.239
also kind of helped my job

224.08 --> 229.28
so hello cameron kamikaze gilmore good

226.799 --> 229.28
to see you

231.68 --> 236.31900000000002
i'm doing pretty good right now hope you

234.319 --> 241.439
are too

236.319 --> 255.11999999999998
logical bananas hello

241.439 --> 257.519
all right

255.12 --> 259.04
so yeah no flat earth debates yesterday

257.519 --> 263.759
not live anyway

259.04 --> 263.759
still the good show uh

265.6 --> 271.28000000000003
yeah also didn't do any newspapers

269.04 --> 272.40000000000003
because there was like this terrible

271.28 --> 275.75899999999996
title on

272.4 --> 280.32
at on front seriously

275.759 --> 284.08000000000004
like oh let's bring let's mix

280.32 --> 287.52
let like let's bring vaccination

284.08 --> 291.68
to the region like again

287.52 --> 293.03999999999996
vaccination called trying to crouch in

291.68 --> 295.6
and yeah i've already met the

293.04 --> 296.8
declaration even a year ago like i'm not

295.6 --> 299.759
going to

296.8 --> 300.8
if there's like this big vaccine

299.759 --> 303.6
[ __ ] called

300.8 --> 304.08
promotion corona promotion on the front

303.6 --> 305.84000000000003
page

304.08 --> 309.12
i'm just going to drop them in the paper

305.84 --> 311.28
bin and i did

309.12 --> 312.24
and i was kind of disappointed when they

311.28 --> 315.28
go for

312.24 --> 316.639
front pages like that even considered

315.28 --> 319.44
like just

316.639 --> 319.44
resigning

320.72 --> 327.44000000000005
but yeah this way i think it's

324.639 --> 327.44
it's good enough

328.16 --> 332.96000000000004
right don't spread fake news don't

330.72 --> 337.12
contribute to fake news when you spot it

332.96 --> 340.15999999999997
like well using the word fake news is

337.12 --> 342.88
all doesn't even work anymore really

340.16 --> 346.0
become so convoluted through mainstream

342.88 --> 346.0
abuse of the word

350.96 --> 353.84
what else

362.4 --> 367.84
oh yeah watch owen benjamin from uh

368.56 --> 373.52
from bit shoot from the day before and

372.08 --> 376.88
indeed he talked about

373.52 --> 380.31899999999996
how he did get his channel did indeed

376.88 --> 384.56
the youtube the latest youtube

380.319 --> 395.84000000000003
barry and larry did get banned again

384.56 --> 395.84
so they're giving him a rough time

401.12 --> 404.29
[Music]

413.759 --> 423.84000000000003
let's see

426.4 --> 430.88
right yeah that was pretty much it

429.28 --> 434.71999999999997
there's a couple of premieres

430.88 --> 434.71999999999997
and quantum eraser that premiere

434.84 --> 442.63899999999995
uh that was funny saw that live

438.8 --> 444.319
that's yeah that's it for my activities

442.639 --> 448.08
yesterday and the rest i

444.319 --> 448.08000000000004
have played that damn game again

448.16 --> 452.16
uh i gotta be careful with it

454.16 --> 459.12
because i i have a tendency to lose

456.96 --> 465.84
myself in it

459.12 --> 465.84000000000003
drown away the hours ah

469.199 --> 473.84000000000003
okay logical bananas do i think ranky

472.0 --> 475.199
flipped because he saw there was more

473.84 --> 478.4
money on the other side

475.199 --> 482.479
well he thought so at least it wasn't

478.4 --> 484.15999999999997
probably seduced because of that reason

482.479 --> 486.56
although yeah i think it's is

484.16 --> 489.91900000000004
short-sighted i think there is

486.56 --> 493.199
enough money on this side

489.919 --> 496.479
just from natural efforts of people

493.199 --> 496.479
like i'm getting around

497.44 --> 504.96
i know it seems like my youtube channel

500.56 --> 507.039
is kind of getting clamped down a little

504.96 --> 508.23999999999995
don't have too much reach but i still

507.039 --> 511.36
get support

508.24 --> 513.839
from people so i i don't see

511.36 --> 515.279
how he's getting more money out of it

513.839 --> 518.6400000000001
unless they're like literally

515.279 --> 520.56
sort of bribing him and then who knows

518.64 --> 522.959
how much he's getting out of that

520.56 --> 535.8389999999999
i don't know hello dutch sailor good to

522.959 --> 535.8389999999999
see you

536.66 --> 541.809
[Music]

555.519 --> 562.64
patreon and shares in super chat

559.279 --> 563.279
what did he get a lot of super chats out

562.64 --> 565.36
of it

563.279 --> 568.32
in recent day i don't know man i i don't

565.36 --> 570.64
watch his activities

568.32 --> 571.7600000000001
supposed to be like on conspiracy cats

570.64 --> 577.8389999999999
channel or whatever

571.76 --> 577.8389999999999
i don't watch it so who knows

586.72 --> 591.839
hello random explorer good to see you

603.12 --> 608.48
oh thank god grass mowing

606.24 --> 610.5600000000001
the grass mower is going away because he

608.48 --> 613.9200000000001
was like mowing up pretty much

610.56 --> 616.399
up until one o'clock i'm

613.92 --> 618.079
very glad that he stopped and before i

616.399 --> 620.24
started the show

618.079 --> 622.3199999999999
because that makes a lot of noise like

620.24 --> 623.6
and even i can put the filter on the mic

622.32 --> 625.519
so that you

623.6 --> 627.44
guys don't get bothered by it but i

625.519 --> 629.44
still will

627.44 --> 633.839
because like the vibration just goes

629.44 --> 633.839
through the whole building

644.079 --> 651.12
right so yeah any any feedback

648.079 --> 654.88
on for example yesterday show or

651.12 --> 661.839
one before that i'm always hoping for

654.88 --> 661.8389999999999
kind of feedback

666.88 --> 675.8389999999999
or maybe some new event

699.92 --> 703.76
i'm just browsing around right now see

702.959 --> 707.5189999999999
if there's

703.76 --> 711.92
something interesting happened

707.519 --> 717.839
in the news looking through infowars in

711.92 --> 717.8389999999999
russia today

721.6 --> 728.88
oh damn not a big flood happen

724.959 --> 732.18
in the bangladesh reason region

728.88 --> 735.32
oh every time that happens it's always

732.18 --> 735.3199999999999
[Music]

735.6 --> 740.5600000000001
like it always the entire place is

737.2 --> 740.5600000000001
trashed it sucks

742.839 --> 745.839
uh

763.68 --> 770.539
anyway let's get back to chat

767.35 --> 770.539
[Music]

770.839 --> 773.839
ah

778.079 --> 782.88
so guys what are you up to anything on

780.959 --> 785.92
your mind

782.88 --> 788.24
you'd like me to address let me know in

785.92 --> 788.24
chat

796.56 --> 801.76
all right yes cameron kamikaze gilmore

798.959 --> 803.76
thanks for addressing that yeah baldwin

801.76 --> 806.56
he is a funny character isn't he and the

803.76 --> 806.56
weird thing is

807.76 --> 814.56
it's pretty serious like

811.2 --> 818.0
he is baldwin is like rumpus level

814.56 --> 821.92
zealot except

818.0 --> 825.68
with yeah

821.92 --> 826.399
another attitude it's it's just a real

825.68 --> 829.68
believer

826.399 --> 832.48
and it's part of me from

829.68 --> 834.4799999999999
from a long time ago like i discovered

832.48 --> 836.72
that element about me that really came

834.48 --> 841.1990000000001
in my teens

836.72 --> 844.72
it really started to flame up and

841.199 --> 848.959
like i never really let it go this is

844.72 --> 852.0
i never really let the ball go it's just

848.959 --> 854.56
i know what it is but

852.0 --> 856.48
it's kind of like legos you know you you

854.56 --> 858.4799999999999
build all this [ __ ] with legos you don't

856.48 --> 861.36
throw the legos out

858.48 --> 863.12
and that's why i've tried to find a

861.36 --> 866.32
another approach in the

863.12 --> 869.04
cosmogonical society

866.32 --> 871.839
use the ball earth as an intellectual

869.04 --> 871.8389999999999
practicing tool

872.16 --> 876.48
and get it kind of away from the hands

874.72 --> 879.519
of the

876.48 --> 882.0790000000001
the dark controllers

879.519 --> 883.519
that specifically use the more

882.079 --> 886.2399999999999
weaponized version

883.519 --> 888.8
it seems it seems maybe it's just their

886.24 --> 888.8
attitudes

891.92 --> 900.959
and yes i am very flexible

896.32 --> 904.279
right it's all about the presuppositions

900.959 --> 906.16
and how do you do it like what makes

904.279 --> 909.76
presuppositions convincing

906.16 --> 909.76
now there's a really tricky

910.16 --> 917.279
fine thing find detail

913.839 --> 921.6800000000001
because it's about believing and what is

917.279 --> 925.12
reasonable to believe and bowen

921.68 --> 927.12
has mastered this i've mastered that a

925.12 --> 930.32
long time ago it's just that

927.12 --> 932.639
as i even explained before back then

930.32 --> 933.6800000000001
i thought like oh yeah astrophysics or

932.639 --> 935.839
astronomy

933.68 --> 936.959
and then just all these freaking gamma

935.839 --> 939.44
people that were so

936.959 --> 940.0
egotistical that couldn't handle

939.44 --> 943.6
criticism

940.0 --> 947.12
that wouldn't that didn't want to evolve

943.6 --> 950.24
right they just wanted to find

947.12 --> 951.759
things to brag with

950.24 --> 954.0790000000001
that's what it seemed to me and that's

951.759 --> 957.6800000000001
why i didn't go there

954.079 --> 960.6389999999999
also just so corrupted so i kind of kept

957.68 --> 963.279
it around and now

960.639 --> 964.72
from within the flat earth scene i am

963.279 --> 969.8389999999999
unleashing him kind of

964.72 --> 969.839
once again from within a golden cage

980.079 --> 984.0
right and there's so many pieces to play

982.639 --> 986.5600000000001
with

984.0 --> 987.04
more things that i've learned about like

986.56 --> 989.5189999999999
i'm

987.04 --> 990.16
a better ball win than i was 20 years

989.519 --> 993.68
ago

990.16 --> 996.7199999999999
because i just know much more

993.68 --> 999.7589999999999
and already had like the fractal

996.72 --> 1002.5600000000001
inside towards it it's just that now a

999.759 --> 1005.04
lot of it is actually crystallized is

1002.56 --> 1005.04
filled in

1006.32 --> 1011.839
and it was really a big odd experience

1008.959 --> 1011.8389999999999
too because

1012.079 --> 1016.88
the dark ones in my visions tried to

1015.04 --> 1020.16
trick me

1016.88 --> 1021.8389999999999
like the ball win was the real thing was

1020.16 --> 1024.8799999999999
the actual thing i'm doing

1021.839 --> 1025.839
instead of like it they showed me things

1024.88 --> 1029.0390000000002
for myself

1025.839 --> 1031.1989999999998
and then cloaked it to try to manipulate

1029.039 --> 1034.079
me somehow

1031.199 --> 1036.4
but from a not very understanding

1034.079 --> 1039.28
perspective from their point of view

1036.4 --> 1041.199
like they didn't yeah this is like

1039.28 --> 1043.76
demons you know they're not really human

1041.199 --> 1047.199
they don't get it

1043.76 --> 1050.64
they don't look at the full picture

1047.199 --> 1051.76
they look at the the influencing

1050.64 --> 1056.72
elements as they

1051.76 --> 1059.919
understand it so i've seen it before

1056.72 --> 1062.559
it's just that in that vision trip it

1059.919 --> 1062.5590000000002
was like

1065.6 --> 1069.36
kind of like a dual cosmogonical society

1068.0 --> 1073.28
like as a baller i

1069.36 --> 1076.4799999999998
would figure out the realm from a curve

1073.28 --> 1079.36
function collapsed perspective right

1076.48 --> 1081.44
so it was kind of dual even in my mind

1079.36 --> 1082.799
and even in baldwin's mind it is dual

1081.44 --> 1086.96
it's just that

1082.799 --> 1086.96
the vantage point is changed

1087.919 --> 1092.4
like balwin understands flat earth and

1090.72 --> 1094.64
understands flatter thinking

1092.4 --> 1097.52
understands that traps could use that to

1094.64 --> 1097.5200000000002
his advantage

1099.12 --> 1103.12
right unlike the the biggest range of

1102.0 --> 1106.32
ballers

1103.12 --> 1109.84
who don't really understand especially

1106.32 --> 1109.84
the the trenchers

1122.32 --> 1126.32
all right lay debate and execute the

1124.559 --> 1130.96
point effectively well first

1126.32 --> 1133.9189999999999
you got to figure out how do they reason

1130.96 --> 1135.52
how where is like the little hop

1133.919 --> 1138.64
suspense of disbelief

1135.52 --> 1140.96
in order to reify it right where is that

1138.64 --> 1143.039
you got to figure out their argument and

1140.96 --> 1145.679
how they think within it

1143.039 --> 1147.84
in order to actually be able to expose

1145.679 --> 1147.8400000000001
it

1148.559 --> 1152.48
and that really requires a lot of

1150.72 --> 1155.679
practice it's like

1152.48 --> 1157.679
for me how i did it is compartmentalize

1155.679 --> 1159.679
myself just go into discussion

1157.679 --> 1161.679
and at the same time while i am

1159.679 --> 1163.1200000000001
interacting and discussing on the level

1161.679 --> 1166.88
of approach

1163.12 --> 1169.9189999999999
i'm also parallel to that

1166.88 --> 1173.8400000000001
looking at the entire situation

1169.919 --> 1177.3600000000001
and getting a more fine line fine-tuned

1173.84 --> 1179.84
observation from it for a later use

1177.36 --> 1182.4799999999998
and then those observations eventually

1179.84 --> 1185.12
all get put together

1182.48 --> 1185.84
so that instead of having that wide

1185.12 --> 1189.039
spectrum

1185.84 --> 1192.32
view for later

1189.039 --> 1195.36
it'll all become synchronized

1192.32 --> 1198.559
and it'll you will just know

1195.36 --> 1200.8799999999999
as you spot it instead

1198.559 --> 1202.0
instead of keeping it for later and this

1200.88 --> 1204.8400000000001
is how i've

1202.0 --> 1206.159
learned a lot of inside skills on my

1204.84 --> 1209.1999999999998
part

1206.159 --> 1210.0
and yeah just constantly dealing with

1209.2 --> 1213.039
ballers

1210.0 --> 1215.44
in all forms on all levels like from

1213.039 --> 1217.76
really polite ballers

1215.44 --> 1221.2
that are actually trying to behave up to

1217.76 --> 1223.28
like total deviance if you just see that

1221.2 --> 1225.6000000000001
activity of how they do it constantly

1223.28 --> 1229.039
then eventually

1225.6 --> 1231.12
if you have that wide spectrum view

1229.039 --> 1233.679
besides your regular personal

1231.12 --> 1237.36
communication view

1233.679 --> 1240.3200000000002
then you will start to understand it

1237.36 --> 1242.6399999999999
you will start to understand like why

1240.32 --> 1244.559
why are they the way they are

1242.64 --> 1245.8400000000001
roughly right you don't know everything

1244.559 --> 1248.8799999999999
about them

1245.84 --> 1252.32
but the way they reason and

1248.88 --> 1255.1200000000001
it reveals a lot and

1252.32 --> 1257.6789999999999
once you have enough cross references

1255.12 --> 1261.36
you will really get a clearer picture

1257.679 --> 1264.72
on how that works anyway

1261.36 --> 1266.559
uh but yeah it's been a lot of fun

1264.72 --> 1268.0
playing ballwin i wonder if nathan

1266.559 --> 1273.12
oakley agrees i think i

1268.0 --> 1276.48
i do give him a bit of a headache also

1273.12 --> 1277.12
i'm kind of envious in ways of the

1276.48 --> 1279.039
ballers

1277.12 --> 1283.039
and i have like baller tendencies

1279.039 --> 1283.039
sometimes where i want to rumpus

1283.28 --> 1286.3999999999999
as i'm doing ballwin and then i kind of

1285.36 --> 1288.9599999999998
have to hold back

1286.4 --> 1290.3200000000002
because i really just want to rumpus him

1288.96 --> 1293.679
on a like

1290.32 --> 1295.84
a minor technical error or something

1293.679 --> 1298.72
to try and gaslight it's like this

1295.84 --> 1301.1999999999998
tendency is very easy to leak in

1298.72 --> 1303.44
the copy is having a bit of trouble with

1301.2 --> 1303.44
that

1303.52 --> 1307.679
and sometimes it's almost like ah i wish

1306.08 --> 1312.6399999999999
nathan would grill me

1307.679 --> 1312.64
just like you would rumpus or something

1312.96 --> 1318.0
because it just makes it a little bit

1315.12 --> 1320.0
more real

1318.0 --> 1322.88
but then again i'm also happy that he

1320.0 --> 1322.88
does like

1323.12 --> 1326.6399999999999
on the other end not do that so that i

1326.32 --> 1331.76
do

1326.64 --> 1335.1200000000001
have more room more room to lay down

1331.76 --> 1339.2
the ideas as ballwin

1335.12 --> 1339.1999999999998
hello by the way tiny wumbo good to see

1344.84 --> 1347.84
you

1358.84 --> 1361.84
hmm

1372.48 --> 1379.039
right but yeah cameron kamikaze omar

1376.0 --> 1381.52
lack of other comments

1379.039 --> 1382.64
to get back to your point it looks easy

1381.52 --> 1384.8799999999999
well it's because

1382.64 --> 1388.159
we have an understanding of how we do it

1384.88 --> 1391.3600000000001
kind of nathan is the guy

1388.159 --> 1393.7600000000002
to find the flaw in the toys

1391.36 --> 1395.6789999999999
in the building struck like i built

1393.76 --> 1397.6
quick and i'm like an on-the-spot

1395.679 --> 1399.8400000000001
architect so i built something and then

1397.6 --> 1399.84
he

1400.559 --> 1406.72
spots the weaknesses like when it

1403.6 --> 1409.1999999999998
and with his spotting the weaknesses

1406.72 --> 1410.32
then trying to yeah basically pull it

1409.2 --> 1413.3600000000001
apart which

1410.32 --> 1415.6789999999999
we will succeed eventually like

1413.36 --> 1417.52
in the the bottom line arguments i can't

1415.679 --> 1421.3600000000001
really refute as balwin

1417.52 --> 1424.72
but he also points like in architectural

1421.36 --> 1428.0
flaws within the ballwin

1424.72 --> 1431.84
creation and i really appreciate that

1428.0 --> 1431.84
because it actually makes me better

1433.039 --> 1439.12
gives a better grip on just the entire

1436.12 --> 1439.12
infrastructure

1439.76 --> 1448.08
of the reasoning

1445.279 --> 1448.96
so yeah it's a it's a rewarding process

1448.08 --> 1451.76
for me

1448.96 --> 1458.1000000000001
i hope you are all enjoying that too

1451.76 --> 1461.369
it's not too confusing

1458.1 --> 1461.369
[Music]

1469.34 --> 1473.84
[Music]

1470.84 --> 1473.84
so

1480.64 --> 1484.159
hello by the way james mason did i miss

1482.64 --> 1487.8400000000001
you

1484.159 --> 1487.8400000000001
gary wiebenga

1503.76 --> 1508.8799999999999
can somebody say something in chat it's

1506.0 --> 1508.88
been eight minutes

1511.679 --> 1517.44
or did i send everybody up off to spiral

1515.039 --> 1517.44
thinking

1517.679 --> 1522.0800000000002
getting all caught up in the details in

1519.679 --> 1522.0800000000002
your head

1522.88 --> 1526.0800000000002
i think i do have a little bit of a

1525.12 --> 1530.9599999999998
tendency to

1526.08 --> 1530.96
to do that the people listening

1536.24 --> 1540.72
because a lot of my explanations are

1538.64 --> 1544.48
really concentrated

1540.72 --> 1547.039
really condensed maybe a

1544.48 --> 1549.3600000000001
few people require some time to unpack

1547.039 --> 1549.36
it all

1549.84 --> 1555.279
[Music]

1552.159 --> 1557.8400000000001
the birds fell out the nest

1555.279 --> 1557.84
what

1577.44 --> 1585.8400000000001
hey nathan r good to see you

1611.55 --> 1614.99
[Music]

1624.84 --> 1627.84
hmm

1635.919 --> 1641.8400000000001
still too early for you james mason okay

1648.399 --> 1656.32
damn it just playing up again

1652.64 --> 1658.64
not very helpful i think i'm probably

1656.32 --> 1661.12
going to be taking it very easy today

1658.64 --> 1661.1200000000001
overall

1664.88 --> 1668.5590000000002
and yeah i really gotta make effort to

1667.919 --> 1670.96
get

1668.559 --> 1672.559
get to bed early this time like i've

1670.96 --> 1674.96
been up

1672.559 --> 1676.6399999999999
late for too many days in a row it's not

1674.96 --> 1679.52
good

1676.64 --> 1682.0800000000002
i can feel it like changing my metabolic

1679.52 --> 1682.08
functions

1685.12 --> 1697.84
hello donato br welcome in chat

1697.87 --> 1700.9299999999998
[Music]

1722.84 --> 1725.84
so

1735.34 --> 1740.399
[Music]

1736.84 --> 1743.52
yeah i'm gonna try something

1740.399 --> 1744.1589999999999
it really worked surprisingly well

1743.52 --> 1746.72
yesterday

1744.159 --> 1748.0
when i was also like getting the bed and

1746.72 --> 1753.679
like my jaw was like

1748.0 --> 1756.32
really like pounding

1753.679 --> 1758.72
not literally pounded not some heavy

1756.32 --> 1764.08
inflammation such but just

1758.72 --> 1764.08
very on the nerve i took magnesium

1764.24 --> 1767.919
and kind of like left it in my mouth and

1766.96 --> 1770.88
like i was

1767.919 --> 1772.24
shocked at how well that worked like

1770.88 --> 1774.5590000000002
pretty quickly

1772.24 --> 1776.64
it totally calmed it down so i'm gonna

1774.559 --> 1781.84
try that again see if it works this time

1776.64 --> 1781.8400000000001
as well

1785.36 --> 1795.84
always take very very little amounts

1789.6 --> 1795.84
as to not overdo it

1796.0 --> 1800.24
i just also came to the conclusion that

1798.08 --> 1804.24
perhaps the tea

1800.24 --> 1807.76
is what caused it to come back now

1804.24 --> 1811.36
i'll have to test that during the day

1807.76 --> 1812.32
and maybe decide to not drink green tea

1811.36 --> 1814.1589999999999
for a while

1812.32 --> 1816.799
because weirdly enough i didn't have it

1814.159 --> 1820.159
with the coffee

1816.799 --> 1823.84
but now that i've drunken a couple of

1820.159 --> 1823.8400000000001
these suddenly

1824.799 --> 1828.1589999999999
and i had green tea yesterday night well

1827.36 --> 1830.8799999999999
up to

1828.159 --> 1833.2
pretty late but not super late as well

1830.88 --> 1837.8400000000001
so maybe there is a direct

1833.2 --> 1837.8400000000001
relation i have to be careful that

1839.12 --> 1842.32
just need that sleep

1843.76 --> 1850.08
any good lunar eclipse videos or info

1846.88 --> 1853.0390000000002
uh what did come up yesterday somebody

1850.08 --> 1853.039
had a video

1854.0 --> 1857.76
but no not

1855.6 --> 1860.08
[Music]

1857.76 --> 1862.64
didn't bump into anything really

1860.08 --> 1862.6399999999999
interesting

1863.84 --> 1879.84
about it after that

1880.399 --> 1887.36
i really hope this works because

1883.6 --> 1887.36
it's really distracting

1889.2 --> 1893.8400000000001
mitchell what

1895.03 --> 1898.339
[Music]

1919.44 --> 1921.76
whoa

1923.6 --> 1928.6399999999999
what the hell that worked instantly

1929.039 --> 1936.72
like instantly just a tiny tiny little

1933.44 --> 1936.72
zip that's incredible

1938.24 --> 1941.76
dude i need to remember that

1945.279 --> 1948.48
like every time now i'm gonna have like

1947.519 --> 1951.44
this

1948.48 --> 1953.519
nagging jaw issue and everybody that's

1951.44 --> 1954.88
followed me for years knows i have this

1953.519 --> 1958.3990000000001
periodically

1954.88 --> 1960.96
usually two times a year or something

1958.399 --> 1962.0
sometimes more i'm gonna try this

1960.96 --> 1965.3600000000001
because like as soon

1962.0 --> 1968.559
as i took it like moved it around

1965.36 --> 1968.559
the location like

1969.44 --> 1973.279
like i know it's still there but it's

1971.76 --> 1975.12
not nagging me now

1973.279 --> 1976.64
that's incredible and it worked

1975.12 --> 1978.9599999999998
instantly

1976.64 --> 1978.96
wow

1980.88 --> 1987.1200000000001
so and i only really

1984.96 --> 1991.76
recently discovered magnesium like what

1987.12 --> 1995.039
is it a few months ago

1991.76 --> 1997.12
man if this turns out to work

1995.039 --> 1999.2
really well then i'm gonna feel kind of

1997.12 --> 2000.6399999999999
stupid that i didn't discover it 20

1999.2 --> 2004.32
years ago

2000.64 --> 2006.24
although i did

2004.32 --> 2008.1589999999999
at the time with my ex kind of

2006.24 --> 2010.3990000000001
discovered but it didn't

2008.159 --> 2012.159
use it for this it was a spray and it

2010.399 --> 2014.9599999999998
was meant for on your skin

2012.159 --> 2018.24
and that even did a pretty amazing job

2014.96 --> 2019.8400000000001
at the time

2018.24 --> 2022.24
never realized that it could work for

2019.84 --> 2026.399
something like this

2022.24 --> 2027.519
huh mitchell from australia had a good

2026.399 --> 2029.9189999999999
video

2027.519 --> 2029.919
all right

2031.44 --> 2034.3200000000002
that didn't see it

2036.88 --> 2044.72
i don't think i'm subscribed to him

2040.559 --> 2044.72
is that literally the name of his

2044.84 --> 2047.84
channel

2063.04 --> 2075.839
doesn't seem to come up

2079.679 --> 2085.28
well i searched on that name and nothing

2082.8 --> 2085.28
came up

2086.56 --> 2089.7599999999998
if you want to link to his channel by

2088.8 --> 2093.679
all means

2089.76 --> 2093.679
you got a wrench so you should be able

2100.839 --> 2103.839
to

2109.76 --> 2117.8390000000004
sorry wrong guy okay

2128.839 --> 2131.839
do

2142.839 --> 2145.839
hmm

2170.839 --> 2173.839
so

2184.839 --> 2187.839
wow

2189.92 --> 2194.4
so yeah guys gonna have some more

2192.48 --> 2197.599
activity he has still got an hour

2194.4 --> 2197.599
50 minutes to go

2198.4 --> 2204.1600000000003
there's some british people in the house

2200.24 --> 2204.16
they should have no reason to be sleepy

2211.52 --> 2215.839
come on

2217.92 --> 2221.76
give me some feedback or bring me a

2220.88 --> 2229.839
subject

2221.76 --> 2229.8390000000004
i'll talk about it

2270.96 --> 2274.56
i guess it's one of those days

2275.839 --> 2279.92
everybody's half asleep behind the

2278.96 --> 2285.839
computer

2279.92 --> 2285.839
or their phone

2286.4 --> 2292.88
oh four days of pouring rain

2289.76 --> 2295.3590000000004
okay seeking star water well it's it's

2292.88 --> 2299.839
it's kind of like that here as well

2295.359 --> 2299.839
although not really pouring

2311.599 --> 2316.2400000000002
yeah james mason you already mentioned

2313.359 --> 2316.24
that name but

2316.72 --> 2326.56
i already youtube searched it

2320.88 --> 2330.2400000000002
and didn't come up

2326.56 --> 2333.359
oh wait now we did okay apparently you

2330.24 --> 2341.2
have to say from australia as one thing

2333.359 --> 2345.839
all right uh yeah

2341.2 --> 2345.839
okay cool i'll subscribe let's see

2348.32 --> 2355.839
did he do lunar eclipse live

2359.52 --> 2383.839
let's take a look i'll link the video

2368.64 --> 2383.839
there you go

2384.48 --> 2388.48
there's quite some nice equipment there

2393.2 --> 2397.839
anyway yeah pretty cool

2407.68 --> 2411.7599999999998
we could talk about the ridiculous

2409.76 --> 2416.4
antarctic treaty

2411.76 --> 2416.4
or what is there to talk about it's

2422.839 --> 2425.839
ridiculous

2432.9 --> 2436.03
[Music]

2439.52 --> 2444.48
well tiny bumble presumably none of the

2442.4 --> 2447.52
flat earthers have any issue

2444.48 --> 2453.839
with you well you don't seem to have any

2447.52 --> 2453.839
issue with me either

2456.319 --> 2460.72
although yeah it's not like i'm really

2458.319 --> 2464.16
talking

2460.72 --> 2467.5989999999997
flatter technicals right now

2464.16 --> 2471.1189999999997
i could somebody

2467.599 --> 2471.119
there's a more specific question

2472.88 --> 2481.839
but yeah the antarctic pretty like what

2475.359 --> 2481.839
about it seeking star water

2483.2 --> 2486.7999999999997
i think like among flat earthers it's

2485.76 --> 2495.8390000000004
well known

2486.8 --> 2495.8390000000004
what what that is

2513.76 --> 2518.5600000000004
right so why could it be there well

2515.76 --> 2518.5600000000004
maybe because

2519.839 --> 2526.96
in their true exploration of it

2523.839 --> 2529.599
admiral bird and all that

2526.96 --> 2531.28
maps lands beyond antarctica well i

2529.599 --> 2531.6800000000003
don't know about that i haven't seen

2531.28 --> 2535.2000000000003
them

2531.68 --> 2537.5989999999997
tear it but maybe it's different maybe

2535.2 --> 2538.7999999999997
it's not lands beyond they're trying to

2537.599 --> 2541.2000000000003
hide or maybe that

2538.8 --> 2543.04
too maybe there's just more to

2541.2 --> 2545.1189999999997
antarctica than

2543.04 --> 2547.599
they've shared maybe they're just trying

2545.119 --> 2548.839
to tell you it's this big chunk of ice

2547.599 --> 2552.1600000000003
on

2548.839 --> 2554.24
land and there's absolutely nothing but

2552.16 --> 2554.64
maybe there is a whole bunch of things

2554.24 --> 2558.0789999999997
like

2554.64 --> 2561.2799999999997
in the eyes or under the eyes

2558.079 --> 2562.4
maybe they scanned this found a whole

2561.28 --> 2565.52
bunch of things like

2562.4 --> 2568.1600000000003
right like like for example what if

2565.52 --> 2570.48
there's just this freaking titan

2568.16 --> 2572.7999999999997
somewhere frozen inside of the ice

2570.48 --> 2574.64
they're just not gonna tell you

2572.8 --> 2575.92
right there might be all these types of

2574.64 --> 2579.1189999999997
things

2575.92 --> 2581.52
that they don't even want

2579.119 --> 2583.359
yeah they they don't want anybody to

2581.52 --> 2585.28
even

2583.359 --> 2587.04
consider that there might be a whole

2585.28 --> 2589.119
bunch of things worth exploring on

2587.04 --> 2593.839
antarctica and that they

2589.119 --> 2593.839
brought up the treaty because of that

2595.04 --> 2599.359
how do i put a link to something well

2597.68 --> 2603.9199999999996
you copy

2599.359 --> 2603.92
the url address and then you paste it in

2604.839 --> 2607.839
chat

2611.359 --> 2621.839
james mason come on

2630.079 --> 2635.3100000000004
yeah seeking star wars admiral bird of

2632.839 --> 2638.57
course

2635.31 --> 2638.57
[Music]

2643.2 --> 2646.96
right but it's not conclusive evidence

2645.28 --> 2651.3590000000004
though that that is all real

2646.96 --> 2653.52
you gotta realize that it could be

2651.359 --> 2655.359
like a sneaky little treasure hunt plan

2653.52 --> 2658.4
of his

2655.359 --> 2660.72
or maybe again it's actually there

2658.4 --> 2662.0
as a cover story to conceal something

2660.72 --> 2665.359
else to draw away the

2662.0 --> 2668.0
attention on the ice skate

2665.359 --> 2669.44
off the icescape onto something beyond

2668.0 --> 2673.2
it which would be hard to

2669.44 --> 2676.64
get there right so maybe that's why

2673.2 --> 2680.319
he put down that story right

2676.64 --> 2680.319
it's the art of misleading

2680.48 --> 2691.839
i'm just saying it could be that

2693.119 --> 2698.56
would sunlight reach those lands

2696.56 --> 2700.48
well it does depends on where those

2698.56 --> 2703.839
lands exactly are and if they're

2700.48 --> 2706.88
like yeah if my

2703.839 --> 2711.2799999999997
idea of rectangular looping

2706.88 --> 2713.04
is anywhere close then there might be a

2711.28 --> 2716.5600000000004
whole new

2713.04 --> 2718.72
realm celestial setup

2716.56 --> 2720.319
right i've demonstrated that picture a

2718.72 --> 2722.56
couple of times i'll show it again i

2720.319 --> 2722.56
guess

2724.64 --> 2733.839
where is it

2744.839 --> 2747.839
uh

2764.96 --> 2772.4
all right this should suffice

2768.56 --> 2774.4
right so if those

2772.4 --> 2775.599
mountains that he talked about are

2774.4 --> 2778.1600000000003
beyond

2775.599 --> 2778.1600000000003
the south

2778.8 --> 2788.079
then it might lie within a new

2782.4 --> 2792.48
setup for the sun orientation right

2788.079 --> 2792.48
could be just saying

2796.8 --> 2801.599
because yeah celestials are not literal

2799.92 --> 2805.599
objects and literal positions

2801.599 --> 2806.4
ever so then you just have to go by the

2805.599 --> 2809.839
cyclical

2806.4 --> 2817.839
patterns oh and if you

2809.839 --> 2817.839
then i came to this conclusion

2827.44 --> 2830.56
seeking star wars should be on the globe

2829.68 --> 2845.839
whatever

2830.56 --> 2845.839
it's all nonsense it's not a globe

2847.53 --> 2853.76
[Music]

2848.96 --> 2857.599
4 000 miles south past the ends

2853.76 --> 2859.8390000000004
4 000 what are you getting that number

2857.599 --> 2859.839
from

2884.839 --> 2891.2
so

2887.28 --> 2901.8390000000004
in the reports wow okay

2891.2 --> 2901.839
man that's that's a massive distance

2912.559 --> 2916.6400000000003
right well let's say it is 4000 miles

2915.92 --> 2920.0
that should be

2916.64 --> 2922.7999999999997
well enough distance to basically get

2920.0 --> 2922.8
close to a

2923.599 --> 2929.839
an equator point again just like the

2926.839 --> 2929.839
drawing

2930.319 --> 2937.2799999999997
and then yeah a place where the sun is

2933.599 --> 2943.839
much higher up

2937.28 --> 2943.8390000000004
more sun

2952.16 --> 2957.2
okay exactly wow okay well that must

2955.119 --> 2960.319
have slipped my attention i didn't know

2957.2 --> 2971.839
he flew that far officially

2960.319 --> 2971.839
that's pretty incredible

2974.96 --> 2981.92
maybe i do have like the file somewhere

2978.319 --> 2985.839
i tend to lose them like just

2981.92 --> 2985.839
among files so many

3002.079 --> 3013.8390000000004
what's this

3019.839 --> 3023.599
oh wait not this isn't there

3024.839 --> 3027.839
hmm

3029.92 --> 3033.139
[Music]

3047.359 --> 3055.839
what's this

3063.04 --> 3068.91
oh right i'm now looking beyond the

3065.359 --> 3071.92
world beyond the polls in that book

3068.91 --> 3075.24
[Music]

3071.92 --> 3078.16
i do have a pdf of that written in

3075.24 --> 3083.04
1950

3078.16 --> 3083.04
i think at

3084.599 --> 3087.599
1959.

3087.68 --> 3093.359
it says they're 2 000 miles over land

3090.4 --> 3096.96
beyond the north pole apparently

3093.359 --> 3099.7599999999998
something like that over there as well

3096.96 --> 3099.76
pretty incredible

3102.8 --> 3105.44
this is not

3106.96 --> 3115.359
oh wait yeah

3111.68 --> 3115.359
this is also admiral bird

3121.68 --> 3125.839
or is this the document

3138.96 --> 3142.0
right yeah i heard that part seeking

3141.119 --> 3145.359
star wars

3142.0 --> 3148.8
like it was said that

3145.359 --> 3152.319
that planes wouldn't shouldn't fly

3148.8 --> 3153.3590000000004
after a certain did after a certain

3152.319 --> 3156.48
distance because

3153.359 --> 3159.2799999999997
then yeah indeed they were said to

3156.48 --> 3159.28
then crash

3159.52 --> 3164.8
striking an invisible barrier is it

3162.8 --> 3167.8390000000004
really described like that

3164.8 --> 3167.8390000000004
that's pretty amazing

3202.0 --> 3209.839
what the wow this is a really sloppily

3206.16 --> 3209.839
grafted together

3220.839 --> 3223.839
pdf

3234.839 --> 3237.839
uh

3256.18 --> 3259.4199999999996
[Music]

3274.64 --> 3280.5589999999997
right yeah

3278.559 --> 3281.1200000000003
sorry if i'm being a little slow today

3280.559 --> 3284.32
guys

3281.12 --> 3284.3199999999997
[Music]

3288.72 --> 3292.8799999999997
but again yeah i do have jaw issues

3290.96 --> 3294.7200000000003
they're not as literally pressing now

3292.88 --> 3297.76
thanks to

3294.72 --> 3297.7599999999998
magnesium but

3299.2 --> 3301.7599999999998
it's still

3302.319 --> 3307.839
bogging me down a little

3313.28 --> 3323.2000000000003
warm water lakes video

3317.92 --> 3323.2000000000003
iron fee video

3331.92 --> 3337.92
i think i heard maybe saw it once

3335.04 --> 3340.319
a video where it was set there they saw

3337.92 --> 3343.2000000000003
woolly mammoths

3340.319 --> 3345.119
or you could see what seemed like woolly

3343.2 --> 3349.2799999999997
mammoths

3345.119 --> 3363.839
big hairy elephants

3349.28 --> 3363.8390000000004
is that the video you're talking about

3380.4 --> 3387.599
secret land doc documentary

3384.0 --> 3387.599
periscope films hmm

3388.319 --> 3395.92
could you could you link up to that

3392.48 --> 3397.52
official bird video anyway yeah if you

3395.92 --> 3399.359
guys have that at hand

3397.52 --> 3400.96
it would be great and it's like online

3399.359 --> 3402.64
somewhere it's great it would be great

3400.96 --> 3405.68
if you could link to that

3402.64 --> 3406.4
in the chat then i can take a look at it

3405.68 --> 3409.839
and also

3406.4 --> 3412.4
other people might be watching this show

3409.839 --> 3414.64
afterward could also take a look at it

3412.4 --> 3414.64
right

3417.28 --> 3420.4
so james mason if you can find this

3419.52 --> 3426.16
secret land

3420.4 --> 3426.1600000000003
documentary that will be great

3426.4 --> 3436.2400000000002
an iron fe

3433.2 --> 3437.68
if anybody has that yeah video or

3436.24 --> 3440.24
pictures from that

3437.68 --> 3441.359
that they knows are online somewhere

3440.24 --> 3447.839
that would be great

3441.359 --> 3447.839
to link it up

3471.52 --> 3477.52
what new zealand antarctica archives

3474.88 --> 3480.079
were taken offline

3477.52 --> 3480.079
what the hell

3481.47 --> 3487.359
[Music]

3484.16 --> 3492.24
that did none of it actually got

3487.359 --> 3492.24
downloaded and uploaded in something

3500.839 --> 3503.839
else

3509.76 --> 3517.8390000000004
copied it but can't paste is it too big

3523.839 --> 3531.839
is that the issue james mason

3533.359 --> 3537.68
is the text too big because it has to be

3536.24 --> 3541.7599999999998
under 200 character

3537.68 --> 3541.7599999999998
in order for you to post it in a youtube

3542.839 --> 3545.839
message

3546.079 --> 3552.0
you could potentially try to split it up

3549.76 --> 3553.119
or minimize it so that it would fit i

3552.0 --> 3556.319
don't know how big it is

3553.119 --> 3559.839
if it's like half a page full of

3556.319 --> 3559.839
characters yeah that's not gonna work

3598.839 --> 3601.839
uh

3622.96 --> 3627.28
it's a video called james mason

3625.28 --> 3643.8390000000004
seriously

3627.28 --> 3643.8390000000004
pissing me off

3645.82 --> 3649.32
[Music]

3657.92 --> 3661.839
dude what is the problem

3663.76 --> 3670.96
see took me 10 seconds

3667.92 --> 3673.599
10 seconds james mason

3670.96 --> 3673.599
jesus

3680.079 --> 3687.04
but yeah i did find it it was

3683.2 --> 3687.04
the first link to pop up under that

3696.839 --> 3701.839

3718.559 --> 3720.799
okay

3722.0 --> 3729.92
so is it like is the copy

paste function disabled

3729.92 --> 3734.7200000000003

james mason

3734.72 --> 3743.2799999999997
i kind of remember hearing about that

3741.039 --> 3744.3190000000004
that it was going to be obstructed that

3743.28 --> 3747.6800000000003

3744.319 --> 3750.0
to paste links for specific mobile phone

3747.68 --> 3755.839
interfaces i heard about that

3750.0 --> 3755.839
is that what's going on

3786.24 --> 3791.0389999999998
right anyway got the video up there

3794.72 --> 3799.52
it's our 11 minutes

3808.839 --> 3815.7599999999998
wow

3811.2 --> 3815.7599999999998
that's definitely fascinating footage

3816.799 --> 3828.799
i think i'll i'll paste that

3825.28 --> 3829.6800000000003
wow yeah i'm definitely gonna paste that

3828.799 --> 3839.839
in skype

3829.68 --> 3839.839
it's a really good link

3913.92 --> 3916.9590000000003
[Music]

3920.839 --> 3923.839
wow

3934.839 --> 3937.839
so

3956.0 --> 3962.72
okay so would anybody like to talk about

3959.119 --> 3966.1600000000003
anything else because

3962.72 --> 3970.0789999999997
yeah dude i haven't had this slow a chat

3966.16 --> 3972.72
in months i'm actually considering just

3970.079 --> 3975.8390000000004
rounding out the show very early

3972.72 --> 3976.8799999999997
because yeah i don't want to have a

3975.839 --> 3979.52
video of me

3976.88 --> 3980.799
just one third of the time just sitting

3979.52 --> 3984.16
there waiting

3980.799 --> 3986.319
for something to happen right and i'm

3984.16 --> 3988.64
not super fluid right now because i do

3986.319 --> 3991.7599999999998
have a bit of a jaw ache

3988.64 --> 3992.24
so unless somebody's going to get things

3991.76 --> 3997.119
going

3992.24 --> 3997.1189999999997
in there i'm going to round up how about

4004.839 --> 4007.839
that

4021.039 --> 4035.8390000000004
good what

4060.839 --> 4063.839
is

4068.24 --> 4076.5589999999997
right yes tiny wombo i know i read you

4073.359 --> 4078.0789999999997
and hey we shouldn't just outright trust

4076.559 --> 4081.44
him

4078.079 --> 4084.1600000000003
i'm not saying we should right it is

4081.44 --> 4087.2000000000003
kind of dubious

4084.16 --> 4088.24
and just looking for evidence of what he

4087.2 --> 4091.839
claimed

4088.24 --> 4091.839
mostly right

4098.799 --> 4104.48
doesn't mean that it isn't interesting

4102.0 --> 4119.839
and he probably did map out a whole

4104.48 --> 4119.839
bunch of things

4130.839 --> 4133.839
so

4167.359 --> 4171.1990000000005
yes iron fe that's right because the

4170.159 --> 4174.0
heliocentric

4171.199 --> 4176.159
model assumes that the sun is in a

4174.0 --> 4177.679
literal euclidean position in relation

4176.159 --> 4179.5199999999995
to the earth

4177.679 --> 4180.96
and then that would all be consistent

4179.52 --> 4184.56
now in reality

4180.96 --> 4187.04
the sun is holographic non-local

4184.56 --> 4188.0
so it doesn't work out it doesn't work

4187.04 --> 4190.96
out with the spherical

4188.0 --> 4191.759
geometry and it doesn't work out with

4190.96 --> 4194.159
the

4191.759 --> 4196.96
assumption that it's light coming from a

4194.159 --> 4203.839999999999
specific euclidean location

4196.96 --> 4203.84
none of that works out that's right

4208.88 --> 4214.159000000001
don't have an accent no tiny one but

4211.28 --> 4218.639999999999
it's not like that

4214.159 --> 4221.92
maybe partially it's this is just stuff

4218.64 --> 4231.84
that's been happening to me for decades

4221.92 --> 4231.84
since i was a teen

4284.84 --> 4287.84
so

4299.84 --> 4304.4800000000005
i'm gonna round out the show this is

4302.56 --> 4307.679
it's all too slow for me

4304.48 --> 4311.599999999999
i don't want to do it anymore i hope

4307.679 --> 4315.84
tomorrow will be better also

4311.6 --> 4315.84
on my side

4316.0 --> 4319.6
definitely try to get some good sleep so

4317.92 --> 4322.4
maybe tomorrow's show will be a little

4319.6 --> 4322.400000000001
bit more fluid

4323.44 --> 4327.36
uh because right now i'm just kind of

4325.76 --> 4329.280000000001
having a headache a little

4327.36 --> 4331.36
not really bad but still enough to

4329.28 --> 4334.239
distract me

4331.36 --> 4336.159
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

4334.239 --> 4340.159
like this show

4336.159 --> 4342.0
i've had better but yeah for those that

4340.159 --> 4344.5599999999995

out for groceries first maybe

4408.32 --> 4413.36
