7.05 --> 41.169999999999995
[Music]

37.32 --> 47.74
good morning welcome to flatter the

41.17 --> 51.46
earlybird number 161 no wait 71 ha I'm

47.74 --> 51.85
almost losing count now 171 I'm your

51.46 --> 54.910000000000004
host

51.85 --> 57.870000000000005
Arwen and before we start the show

54.91 --> 61.92999999999999
please don't forget to share the show

57.87 --> 63.4
any platform you like and please if you

61.93 --> 65.08
haven't already subscribed to my channel

63.4 --> 67.119
and hit the bell notification so you

65.08 --> 68.77
know when I'm going live which usually

67.119 --> 75.06
is 2 p.m.

68.77 --> 78.64
Amsterdam time so today the weather is

75.06 --> 82.15
dreary it's it's not really cold that's

78.64 --> 86.95
kind of okay it's just constantly

82.15 --> 90.19
clouded and rainy not hard rain it's not

86.95 --> 91.96000000000001
storming at all it's just dreary but at

90.19 --> 94.57
least it's not that cold and I know the

91.96 --> 97.78
plants definitely love this kind of

94.57 --> 107.28999999999999
weather as long as it doesn't last for

97.78 --> 114.07
too long so but yeah inside is not very

107.29 --> 124.33000000000001
warm so I got me heater back on man

114.07 --> 126.60999999999999
yesterday yesterday was nuts.i I had

124.33 --> 130.899
like the craziest day yesterday

126.61 --> 133.29
it's from the start yeah I had a very

130.899 --> 138.18
good night rest I told you on the show

133.29 --> 140.56
got up very early like 9 o'clock

138.18 --> 147.16
something like that or even before that

140.56 --> 149.709
and I went on and went home and yeah

147.16 --> 152.4
after the early bird show which was a

149.709 --> 157.959
pretty good show I got on the debates

152.4 --> 161.17000000000002
didn't take too long and well the

157.959 --> 164.1
expected happened it's like James and

161.17 --> 168.30999999999997
everything then I basically went away

164.1 --> 172.45
to do my paper rounds because I just had

168.31 --> 176.08
to couldn't wait too long with that then

172.45 --> 181.54
when I got back it was still going like

176.08 --> 182.98000000000002
what okay and then I kept on going and

181.54 --> 186.25
it just kept on going

182.98 --> 188.47
it was incredible and it got really

186.25 --> 192.07
heated apparently and I missed some

188.47 --> 197.67
spots apparently there's been a clash

192.07 --> 200.76999999999998
between Nathan and ebon now because even

197.67 --> 204.33999999999997
posted copyrighted material from the

200.77 --> 209.14000000000001
show before Nathan would be premiering

204.34 --> 213.91
it and it refused to to undo that or

209.14 --> 216.88
something I don't know exactly this just

213.91 --> 219.57999999999998
came to me freshly but my god yeah

216.88 --> 223.6
yesterday it just kept on going right

219.58 --> 225.63000000000002
so then eventually everybody got sniped

223.6 --> 230.53
out or something it was weird

225.63 --> 237.31
then we got back and we kept on going

230.53 --> 242.519
and we we kept on talking incredibly

237.31 --> 248.89000000000001
long like me and chocolate and was there

242.519 --> 251.20000000000002
Evon to or another guy ah no I know was

248.89 --> 253.45
it right so just kept on talking and I

251.2 --> 256.87
had so much energy and was just it was

253.45 --> 259.51
great and yeah I took wine now here gets

256.87 --> 263.14
your sneaks is the problem that sneaked

259.51 --> 266.05
in its a planning problem and I know

263.14 --> 269.21999999999997
exactly what went wrong so it basically

266.05 --> 273.19
happened is I didn't have any dinner

269.22 --> 275.55
because if I wanted to have dinner I

273.19 --> 278.919
would have to be working on it for

275.55 --> 283.06
probably two hours before I could eat

278.919 --> 286.96
something and I just couldn't get away I

283.06 --> 289.0
couldn't get away and and I had to do my

286.96 --> 291.15999999999997
newspaper route and then usually I don't

289.0 --> 292.93
get to cooking anyway so I just messed

291.16 --> 296.07000000000005
up my planning and it's because I was

292.93 --> 298.78000000000003
supposed to cook

296.07 --> 301.81
yesterday or the day before but I was

298.78 --> 305.71
lazy both days and now because of that I

301.81 --> 307.87
crashed yeah like after the talk kept on

305.71 --> 313.40999999999997
watching stuff I drank the whole bottle

307.87 --> 318.43
and then I got really sick and just

313.41 --> 322.54
collapsed pretty much to clean up the

318.43 --> 328.419
mess this morning I didn't get give any

322.54 --> 330.66900000000004
noise issues or anything didn't ya like

328.419 --> 337.06
puke in the hallway or anything like

330.669 --> 339.94
that but that was messed up and now I

337.06 --> 342.57
feel like kind of yeah

339.94 --> 342.57
hard hit

349.61 --> 355.72900000000004
and I guess it's also because yeah two

353.0 --> 358.49
days in a row not properly having dinner

355.729 --> 361.31
it but still drinking a bottle of wine

358.49 --> 365.06
it's just I don't know looking at it it

361.31 --> 367.159
feels like yesterday was an amazing day

365.06 --> 370.43
and it kind of worked but I just didn't

367.159 --> 374.599
plan it out well it felt very me in my

370.43 --> 376.669
early 20s when I was improvising a lot

374.599 --> 378.8
and just trying to reach peaks and

376.669 --> 384.409
didn't plan [ __ ] out this what happened

378.8 --> 389.05
to me a lot although I wouldn't you I

384.409 --> 392.0
had a an active not get nauseated or

389.05 --> 393.8
yeah not to throw up under any

392.0 --> 397.58
circumstance I was really good at that

393.8 --> 399.469
but I don't know it was a totally

397.58 --> 402.349
different state of mind and I had a lot

399.469 --> 405.469
more energy available that I pretty much

402.349 --> 409.0
wasted in retrospect but I guess that's

405.469 --> 409.0
what youth is

414.3 --> 423.24
and despite my appearances I am older

418.94 --> 425.34
than I used to be but I can still do

423.24 --> 428.55
things if yeah I'm planning it's

425.34 --> 432.21
everything and I have to get more strict

428.55 --> 438.87
with myself that's pretty much the point

432.21 --> 441.75
to the story here because I do plan very

438.87 --> 444.21
meticulously with my with my food I have

441.75 --> 446.069
to because I am eating or all organic I

444.21 --> 449.06899999999996
have to do it all myself I have to make

446.069 --> 452.40000000000003
it affordable and just start planning

449.069 --> 454.94
and I take it very seriously almost to a

452.4 --> 458.33
professional level make sure that

454.94 --> 464.099
everything just keeps running smooth

458.33 --> 468.93
that I keep fed well and don't go into a

464.099 --> 473.94
weakened or sick state yeah but if I get

468.93 --> 475.97
lazy too many times yeah it's very

473.94 --> 482.28
dangerous

475.97 --> 486.53000000000003
anyway me rambling on so let's see who

482.28 --> 486.53
is in chat a lot of activity

491.3 --> 500.39
Rambo Shambo was first I just forced

495.02 --> 511.28
over Mukul Samus and my UK I Akio the

500.39 --> 517.9
hope X 320 that's probably the guy I

511.28 --> 520.4499999999999
banned yesterday you know we go yeah

517.9 --> 526.36
I'll just see where that goes anyway uh

520.45 --> 526.36
people in chat the random Explorer

536.1 --> 548.44
anything right am i UK no alcohol for

540.79 --> 553.15
four years that's really good it's weird

548.44 --> 558.19
with me alcohols never been a real real

553.15 --> 562.18
problem in the sense that if I overdo it

558.19 --> 566.9200000000001
my body just just crashes really quickly

562.18 --> 571.3299999999999
so I can't be an alcoholic because I

566.92 --> 574.24
wouldn't survive it for very long and my

571.33 --> 578.23
intuition just doesn't align I don't

574.24 --> 580.15
want to drink now very obviously I have

578.23 --> 583.0
this feeling like okay I've had enough

580.15 --> 587.85
of this for now and that means usually

583.0 --> 590.92
I'll not drink for at least a week and

587.85 --> 596.71
yeah it's very different with cannabis

590.92 --> 602.0699999999999
though because really stopping with that

596.71 --> 608.23
for me is much more difficult because I

602.07 --> 612.07
just have a lot of longing for it and I

608.23 --> 615.37
use it like I don't know like I guess

612.07 --> 617.5300000000001
smokers typically use their smoke break

615.37 --> 619.96
they just contemplate things think about

617.53 --> 622.75
things go through things I do it before

619.96 --> 626.34
the show usually I just smoke and just

622.75 --> 628.81
go through things let it let it all

626.34 --> 631.57
reflect upon it all like think about

628.81 --> 633.8699999999999
what I will roughly be going to say

631.57 --> 636.34
what's what's the energy I'm gonna hit

633.87 --> 640.48
where am I gonna go with this energy

636.34 --> 647.62
wise and yeah cannabis smoking with

640.48 --> 651.1
tobacco is just very effective

647.62 --> 652.96
but it also is alluring I keep wanting

651.1 --> 655.23
more of it and there is a bit of a

652.96 --> 655.23
problem

655.89 --> 661.92
although yeah well the problem is it can

658.9 --> 667.06
technically keep on going but eventually

661.92 --> 669.9699999999999
it kind of like subtly it becomes so

667.06 --> 672.9399999999999
heavy that your intelligence just shuts

669.97 --> 673.4200000000001
off or you kind of become numb that's

672.94 --> 676.1500000000001
weird

673.42 --> 680.8
that numbness goes away though but

676.15 --> 683.89
that's like when I really smoke over my

680.8 --> 686.3199999999999
normal amounts when I really start

683.89 --> 687.79
piling it on like when I'm with friends

686.32 --> 690.34
that are suddenly throwing a giant bag

687.79 --> 692.26
of weed down it doesn't happen these

690.34 --> 694.14
days anymore but that used to happen a

692.26 --> 697.78
lot I don't know it wasn't a time when

694.14 --> 701.1999999999999
cannabis smokers just normally shared

697.78 --> 703.23
joints that was normal somehow I don't

701.2 --> 709.71
know I don't experience that anymore

703.23 --> 709.71
yeah but yeah

714.87 --> 721.74
cannabis it's it's much better doable

719.12 --> 724.5600000000001
doesn't have as many downsides but if

721.74 --> 730.6800000000001
you overdo it at least I I just get numb

724.56 --> 735.3299999999999
down by it and of course the finances

730.68 --> 738.51
always it it costs that's that's mostly

735.33 --> 740.37
the main problem even like a stress

738.51 --> 744.0889999999999
inducing factor about it

740.37 --> 745.86
it's if it was a lot cheaper then I

744.089 --> 748.25
would probably even have less problems

745.86 --> 750.69
even though I might be smoking more

748.25 --> 754.2
because there would be no financial

750.69 --> 755.7900000000001
downside to it that I would be that

754.2 --> 761.7900000000001
would be burdening me as I would be

755.79 --> 764.01
doing it yeah but for that I'd have to

761.79 --> 767.279
technically grow it myself in like a

764.01 --> 775.83
back garden or something and I don't

767.279 --> 778.65
have one hmm oh hello a roof and hello

775.83 --> 780.8000000000001
earlier stopping traffic in my rest I

778.65 --> 780.8
had

804.42 --> 816.18
Oh oh my god

807.71 --> 819.23
x3 20 that's and the hundred percent

816.18 --> 819.2299999999999
real videos

831.26 --> 837.16
I know words I have no words to respond

835.25 --> 844.93
to that

837.16 --> 844.93
hello Jose good morning to you

851.85 --> 860.1
Yeah right you'd oh that's 20-pound oh

857.03 --> 864.03
that's even more expensive than here but

860.1 --> 867.12
it's logical because it's I take it

864.03 --> 869.37
you're in England right or is it in

867.12 --> 875.37
America anyway in England it's not even

869.37 --> 880.53
legal anyway and in America it depends

875.37 --> 882.63
on the state that but it's pound so it's

880.53 --> 885.24
gonna be you're talking about England

882.63 --> 893.28
right so it's not even legal that's

885.24 --> 895.52
bound to be more expensive than here all

893.28 --> 895.52
right

896.42 --> 902.6899999999999
so starts talking about giant packets

903.03 --> 906.1
[Music]

908.09 --> 921.12
$800 a pound and 500 grams hundred

913.29 --> 922.86
dollars yeah that's that's probably five

921.12 --> 928.37
to six times cheaper than what it is

922.86 --> 931.38
here in the small amounts because

928.37 --> 936.66
legally you can't even deal in large

931.38 --> 940.32
packets in the Netherlands there it's a

936.66 --> 942.6899999999999
weird system it was like a trial system

940.32 --> 944.6400000000001
but they never really moved on to full

942.69 --> 952.2600000000001
legalization you have just kept it there

944.64 --> 955.05
sort of well right true if well I saw

952.26 --> 959.04
your question and then I scrolled up a

955.05 --> 962.3599999999999
little big bit a bit back further so

959.04 --> 969.93
what you start out to say and I thought

962.36 --> 971.82
that doesn't feel too good sounds like

969.93 --> 975.9599999999999
maybe you have some troll ashiness

971.82 --> 978.96
currently going on so I was gonna just

975.96 --> 981.09
see what else you were gonna say before

978.96 --> 983.3000000000001
I make up my mind and invite you on the

981.09 --> 983.3000000000001
show

990.61 --> 993.73
[Music]

1001.01 --> 1005.0889999999999
me being a troll

1013.14 --> 1021.4499999999999
all right okay well if it was in

1019.89 --> 1024.42
response to some of the things you've

1021.45 --> 1029.39
been saying last time you came on no I

1024.42 --> 1034.74
was not being a troll I I basically just

1029.39 --> 1038.48
yeah telling you that the real knowledge

1034.74 --> 1041.79
you have is not worth anything it's all

1038.48 --> 1045.48
presuppositional [ __ ] things you

1041.79 --> 1049.76
can't really basically confirm that's

1045.48 --> 1049.76
probably what it was in response to

1057.54 --> 1070.53
all right right oh yeah your email whoo

1062.61 --> 1072.4199999999998
yeah that's right yeah now I remember it

1070.53 --> 1079.74
wasn't in our hangout it was in the

1072.42 --> 1085.2
email and it's just yeah that's the same

1079.74 --> 1089.4
type of posts I would see comments um on

1085.2 --> 1098.03
the hangout it's just can't be serious

1089.4 --> 1098.0300000000002
man hey Randy good morning

1110.19 --> 1118.77
yeah trim my nails yeah I kind of agree

1115.76 --> 1122.4
but I'm just happy that my nails are

1118.77 --> 1127.43
doing pretty good maybe it's because

1122.4 --> 1127.43
I've been having a couple of drinks of

1128.75 --> 1136.38
the bone broth basically the formerly

1132.24 --> 1139.77
known as caveman formula and that I

1136.38 --> 1142.47
guess that also does help your nails and

1139.77 --> 1146.1299999999999
everything growth because ever since

1142.47 --> 1150.09
yeah my nails are not as breaky as they

1146.13 --> 1153.1100000000001
have been sometime before like I guess

1150.09 --> 1157.32
during the winter period they were

1153.11 --> 1159.5
getting more fragile than usual but I

1157.32 --> 1164.36
need to probably trim them down a bit

1159.5 --> 1164.36
because it's getting in the way you know

1178.55 --> 1192.93
right come on

1181.55 --> 1194.12
no okay well I do kind of take care of

1192.93 --> 1198.15
him so why not

1194.12 --> 1200.79
so yeah nails we I have nails especially

1198.15 --> 1202.92
this pinkie nail seems to be surviving

1200.79 --> 1210.42
and usually long but I'm not gonna keep

1202.92 --> 1213.3300000000002
it that long it's just because he's got

1210.42 --> 1216.75
a break at some point just when it's dry

1213.33 --> 1218.61
all of a sudden I just crash it into the

1216.75 --> 1221.22
corner of the wall or whatever ends

1218.61 --> 1223.1699999999998
gonna break and it happens it happens

1221.22 --> 1226.2
it happened regularly during the

1223.17 --> 1231.5700000000002
wintertime and I kind of looks kind of

1226.2 --> 1235.23
weird I I agree no no no absolutely not

1231.57 --> 1238.62
it's just that is offensive roof that is

1235.23 --> 1241.71
exactly why I'm timing you out right now

1238.62 --> 1245.84
and why I don't get you on the panel

1241.71 --> 1245.8400000000001
because you're obviously in a dick mood

1248.07 --> 1254.9099999999999
no need for that

1252.01 --> 1254.91
thank you

[Music]

1278.53 --> 1288.75
yeah it's weird you you seem to be like

1281.89 --> 1288.75
a troll it's very weird

1312.06 --> 1314.8999999999999
all right

1329.31 --> 1339.73
yeahyou this correct it's it it is

1333.52 --> 1343.57
offensive look I find coke using in

1339.73 --> 1349.5
general it's just this and I don't do

1343.57 --> 1349.5
that never never ever done that yes

1356.47 --> 1362.22
I don't know I I don't think I'd really

1359.59 --> 1362.22
need it

1369.13 --> 1378.3700000000001
I I think it would be very counter

1373.83 --> 1382.24
counteractive to whatever I would be

1378.37 --> 1385.6499999999999
trying to achieve I don't know it is the

1382.24 --> 1385.65
coke is bad

1392.49 --> 1395.68
[Music]

1401.56 --> 1411.6699999999998
oh god no thanks misty cook me tea oh

1405.21 --> 1418.14
dear God that would be so pointless it

1411.67 --> 1422.71
would literally die just die out and

1418.14 --> 1425.0800000000002
then I'd get really pissed off at some

1422.71 --> 1426.73
point maybe and then slick James is

1425.08 --> 1428.59
gonna act like he's suddenly he like

1426.73 --> 1432.19
he's my counselor and just keep on

1428.59 --> 1437.8
dragging on and dragging on until I

1432.19 --> 1442.95
either leave or just start to like

1437.8 --> 1446.74
totally screaming at him like totally

1442.95 --> 1448.6000000000001
anger [ __ ] and just throw exactly what I

1446.74 --> 1450.91
think about it without any brakes that

1448.6 --> 1460.81
kind of [ __ ] pretty much like what I did

1450.91 --> 1462.88
yesterday but more loud and I don't see

1460.81 --> 1465.58
the point of it there is no point with

1462.88 --> 1469.96
like James that is the that is my point

1465.58 --> 1473.34
that is the big problem it's just he is

1469.96 --> 1473.3400000000001
a red herring salesman

1481.18 --> 1489.26
and he even said I can't believe that he

1484.31 --> 1492.05
actually said that and he is a master

1489.26 --> 1496.21
manipulator and apparently his

1492.05 --> 1499.78
references is that he used to be a pimp

1496.21 --> 1502.8690000000001
just wow what

1499.78 --> 1502.869
[Music]

1519.16 --> 1521.7900000000002
yeah

1527.64 --> 1539.44
straw a straw man suit that's that's

1533.02 --> 1544.78
funny but it's that guy is something

1539.44 --> 1548.47
else and to be fair with all that

1544.78 --> 1552.79
combined his attitude what he does him

1548.47 --> 1558.22
actually is saying that thinking about

1552.79 --> 1561.46
himself like that just without any kind

1558.22 --> 1566.71
of a apology for it or anything any kind

1561.46 --> 1571.78
of modesty it's just I hate people like

1566.71 --> 1574.69
that like genuinely despise them in real

1571.78 --> 1581.3999999999999
I despise pimps in general I think

1574.69 --> 1586.3300000000002
they're very creepy people it's just

1581.4 --> 1592.5400000000002
it's social abuse you know manipulating

1586.33 --> 1595.4499999999998
and just oh I can't stand it so it made

1592.54 --> 1597.3999999999999
it worse okay so maybe it's a good point

1595.45 --> 1600.88
that he was not telling people about

1597.4 --> 1607.47
himself because turns out he's kind of a

1600.88 --> 1607.47
terrible person or at least used to be

1610.77 --> 1617.73
but yeah to be able to do that that is

1613.77 --> 1623.19
something else you know that you get to

1617.73 --> 1625.29
that position this yeah it's gonna be

1623.19 --> 1627.51
very completely about Who am I to judge

1625.29 --> 1631.71
and yeah there was a situation and he

1627.51 --> 1635.48
was just doing something I get that but

1631.71 --> 1635.48
you were capable of doing that

1637.309 --> 1647.4289999999999
you didn't escape the [ __ ] if that is

1643.29 --> 1651.3899999999999
the case so that means that you kind of

1647.429 --> 1654.7800000000002
felt comfortable with that apparently no

1651.39 --> 1657.9
that tells you a lot of yeah what is

1654.78 --> 1662.03
what is your home where are you

1657.9 --> 1664.1100000000001
comfortable that's your home so you know

1662.03 --> 1668.1
talking about snakes

1664.11 --> 1673.29
sounds like snake came crawling out of

1668.1 --> 1675.84
the den and then started getting in

1673.29 --> 1678.8899999999999
between other groups and yeah basically

1675.84 --> 1681.6789999999999
blaming everyone that there are snakes

1678.89 --> 1684.5400000000002
because he didn't like what they said

1681.679 --> 1691.19
that's pretty much yeah

1684.54 --> 1700.559
Slick James in a in a nutshell anyway

1691.19 --> 1702.88
enough slick shaming it's ridiculous

1700.559 --> 1705.4189999999999
this entire situation is getting

1702.88 --> 1705.419
ridiculous

1716.11 --> 1721.6789999999999
all right it just had to be snakes

1718.87 --> 1721.6789999999999
didn't it

1725.029 --> 1733.519
what series stop okay that's another

1729.799 --> 1737.6589999999999
raster moment here Jesus

1733.519 --> 1745.329
when raster said he says [ __ ] okay so a

1737.659 --> 1748.519
crack dealer did he say that really that

1745.329 --> 1750.109
because I remember that he clearly said

1748.519 --> 1751.909
and confirmed that he was a pimp

1750.109 --> 1755.4189999999999
relating to being a master manipulator

1751.909 --> 1756.939
but he was a crack dealer really holy

1755.419 --> 1763.0990000000002
[ __ ]

1756.939 --> 1763.5690000000002
your dad and holy [ __ ] I didn't catch

1763.099 --> 1770.329
that

1763.569 --> 1773.109
or is that he didn't say that and you

1770.329 --> 1773.109
think

1779.5 --> 1792.91
right ok-ran t i wondering how to

1789.64 --> 1796.96
interpret that that sentence right there

1792.91 --> 1807.49
if you know what I mean because I'm not

1796.96 --> 1811.9
seeing a comma there kingpin huh yeah

1807.49 --> 1814.42
gang leader right I just wonder if

1811.9 --> 1818.0500000000002
that's all real or that it just that

1814.42 --> 1821.6100000000001
it's part of his image that is just all

1818.05 --> 1821.61
making it up I have no idea

1827.47 --> 1842.39
yeah yeah yeah Jose I thought I thought

1831.05 --> 1851.31
as much what the [ __ ] be Mars what the

1842.39 --> 1854.1200000000001
hell was wrong with you that is just

1851.31 --> 1857.9199999999998
[Music]

1854.12 --> 1857.9199999999998
that is just terrible man

1865.07 --> 1883.5
right Resta right well but now I'm just

1880.23 --> 1886.02
starting look it feels like indecency to

1883.5 --> 1890.7
now start digging and speculating about

1886.02 --> 1893.25
his personal life like okay he basically

1890.7 --> 1896.25
asked for it by handing all that [ __ ]

1893.25 --> 1898.98
out but it still feels kind of wrong

1896.25 --> 1903.9
because I there's factors that I don't

1898.98 --> 1906.99
know for sure but just thinking out loud

1903.9 --> 1910.23
kind of okay if he was actually like a

1906.99 --> 1912.8700000000001
crack dealer that kind of does make

1910.23 --> 1916.85
sense because then it becomes much

1912.87 --> 1921.3
easier to manipulate people seriously

1916.85 --> 1923.01
that makes sense because he's not gonna

1921.3 --> 1929.6399999999999
get it from his trickery and his

1923.01 --> 1932.43
intelligence obviously so and my god

1929.64 --> 1935.24
those yeah if he wasn't then those must

1932.43 --> 1938.0700000000002
have been some really dumb ass [ __ ]

1935.24 --> 1942.84
basically dumb ass hoes like really

1938.07 --> 1945.54
freakin bottom rock bottom dumb but

1942.84 --> 1946.6499999999999
afterward yeah like drugs involved then

1945.54 --> 1952.71
that makes more sense

1946.65 --> 1955.43
anyway enough about that now the earth

1952.71 --> 1958.2
is not slick but the earth is flat

1955.43 --> 1960.529
definitely

1958.2 --> 1963.3890000000001
and I thought yesterday starting out

1960.529 --> 1965.7
that I needed to remind everyone that it

1963.389 --> 1969.7199999999998
was actually called Flat Earth debate so

1965.7 --> 1973.5800000000002
it's just saying the earth is flat the

1969.72 --> 1973.58
earth is flat

1979.639 --> 1987.1789999999999
now Randy look you can't really defeat

1984.45 --> 1991.5900000000001
slick he's like it it's just not gonna

1987.179 --> 1997.049
go away unless you like literally remove

1991.59 --> 1999.6
him so but I'm just gonna let him do

1997.049 --> 2002.4189999999999
what he does for a while and if I'm just

1999.6 --> 2005.48
in there and I'm really sick of it then

2002.419 --> 2008.8400000000001
I'm just gonna yell at him tell him

2005.48 --> 2014.179
exactly what I think about him about how

2008.84 --> 2018.789
he is a giant in-your-face hypocrite and

2014.179 --> 2022.7
all that it's just riffles repulsive and

2018.789 --> 2025.279
but yeah I know you can attack him you

2022.7 --> 2029.0900000000001
can damage him he doesn't care he's

2025.279 --> 2032.96
still coming back you know he can get

2029.09 --> 2035.2099999999998
pissed off but he doesn't yeah you he

2032.96 --> 2037.609
doesn't really go away he's not taking a

2035.21 --> 2042.47
hint any hint he's just sitting there

2037.609 --> 2043.85
doing his stupid thing interrupting

2042.47 --> 2046.7
people breaking the flow of the

2043.85 --> 2050.6189999999997
conversation he's like yeah like a troll

2046.7 --> 2058.01
but with a more sophisticated program

2050.619 --> 2060.409
but still dumb it's not a program like

2058.01 --> 2062.5690000000004
for example the way rompers does things

2060.409 --> 2064.099
it's not on that level it's not so

2062.569 --> 2064.73
technical it's not intellect you could

2064.099 --> 2067.73
never do that

2064.73 --> 2072.04
so it's just doing it but more with

2067.73 --> 2075.619
philosophy crap and beliefs and

2072.04 --> 2079.75
experience and being very meta basically

2075.619 --> 2079.75
at that it's insufferable

2087.409 --> 2097.859
hey Brandon slick has nowhere to go

2090.54 --> 2102.83
maybe maybe he went on a too big a

2097.859 --> 2106.109
bluffing tour and he could potentially

2102.83 --> 2108.5699999999997
Bluff his way through under the right

2106.109 --> 2112.5
circumstances but yeah if he got caught

2108.57 --> 2117.71
he would be absolutely scolded and

2112.5 --> 2122.91
basically like piss off you [ __ ] liar

2117.71 --> 2124.68
[ __ ] maybe that happen I don't know I'm

2122.91 --> 2127.0499999999997
not saying that is what happened I don't

2124.68 --> 2130.589
know what happened to him but it's very

2127.05 --> 2134.57
weird that he's getting in these that

2130.589 --> 2134.57
he's putting himself in the debates

2143.9 --> 2152.069
ranty stop joking around man you know it

2149.52 --> 2154.38
doesn't work that way I am crushing him

2152.069 --> 2165.66
but he's not gonna go away is plenty

2154.38 --> 2173.839
obvious yeah well alright good I will

2165.66 --> 2173.839
crush him I will crush slake James Oh

2177.41 --> 2185.8689999999997
wrap around him like a Python and

2179.97 --> 2185.8689999999997
squeeze that mouse till his head pops

2188.63 --> 2199.079
but first I'm gonna Photoshop in it yeah

2192.089 --> 2201.72
an image of that I don't know I have to

2199.079 --> 2206.039
be in the mood to be like that yesterday

2201.72 --> 2208.589
I was just I was kind of cranky so I was

2206.039 --> 2211.65
literally just using an excuse to vent

2208.589 --> 2213.9
that [ __ ] on some I'm something that I'm

2211.65 --> 2215.76
genuinely pissed off about even though

2213.9 --> 2222.089
it may not not have been the direct

2215.76 --> 2229.0490000000004
cause of the agitation and yeah but not

2222.089 --> 2233.64
gonna happen today Randy you're in a

2229.049 --> 2238.73
weird mood show the bow and arrow

2233.64 --> 2241.65
well yeah it's right there you know

2238.73 --> 2248.45
what's there to show it's a bow and

2241.65 --> 2248.4500000000003
their arrows and you could shoot them

2250.38 --> 2259.03
I'm not gonna fool around with that here

2255.0 --> 2261.82
but hey if I get better streaming

2259.03 --> 2265.78
capabilities then at some point yeah I

2261.82 --> 2268.03
already said I will go out there and I

2265.78 --> 2273.9700000000003
might do like a bow video sometime that

2268.03 --> 2275.59
would be funny why not technically I

2273.97 --> 2277.99
could do it right over there there's

2275.59 --> 2281.21
like an open field there could just put

2277.99 --> 2284.4199999999996
up stuff and start shooting why not

2281.21 --> 2284.42
[Music]

2299.04 --> 2301.94
oh cool

2302.95 --> 2311.46
I can be a are you do you happen to plan

2306.7 --> 2311.46
to come to the Amsterdam conference

2320.99 --> 2325.64
maybe we could do a combined video I

2323.27 --> 2329.119
could look a boat I can just bring it

2325.64 --> 2332.48
just and string it and it's just

2329.119 --> 2334.7000000000003
perfectly fine to take that alone so I

2332.48 --> 2341.27
could practically bring my bow we could

2334.7 --> 2343.6299999999997
do something that will be fun make a

2341.27 --> 2343.63
video

2372.85 --> 2375.5099999999998
yeah

2377.0 --> 2384.94
what what did he say I just missed it

2388.53 --> 2391.719
[Music]

2395.06 --> 2401.93
anyway let's see 20 more minutes to go

2406.61 --> 2409.61
okay

2427.28 --> 2430.03
why

2433.37 --> 2445.24
that is a weird story you'd know when

2442.76 --> 2445.2400000000002
there's ease

2465.48 --> 2475.64
okay that is weird fate fate elephant oh

2471.75 --> 2478.64
one I don't think that sentence came out

2475.64 --> 2478.64
completed

2480.22 --> 2485.0099999999998
[Music]

2486.63 --> 2495.049
Oh P Mars you're such a character

2498.11 --> 2501.2090000000003
[Music]

2503.37 --> 2513.39
I need be careful with that wrench like

2510.78 --> 2517.11
if you plan to actually time somebody

2513.39 --> 2521.37
out it's better to first scroll it up a

2517.11 --> 2523.34
little so it stays stuck and then when

2521.37 --> 2525.96
you're aiming at the dots or whatever

2523.34 --> 2527.4900000000002
it's not certainly gonna pop up and

2525.96 --> 2532.2200000000003
you're gonna accidentally click somebody

2527.49 --> 2532.22
something else just a tip in moderating

2535.74 --> 2547.6499999999996
[Music]

2544.67 --> 2551.91
unless you're like really quick and just

2547.65 --> 2553.92
like Auto instant banning spam trolls or

2551.91 --> 2557.3599999999997
whatever if that's the case then yeah

2553.92 --> 2557.36
scrolling up doesn't work of course

2572.37 --> 2576.3889999999997
[Music]

2581.39 --> 2589.1099999999997
[Music]

2582.56 --> 2595.38
right you know what I'm maybe I'm gonna

2589.11 --> 2600.56
try to do a live Photoshop moment I

2595.38 --> 2604.62
could technically do that just Photoshop

2600.56 --> 2606.87
the image of what I was planning I know

2604.62 --> 2614.42
it might take a while though might be a

2606.87 --> 2614.42
little bit boring well

2618.09 --> 2620.8700000000003
what it says

2637.73 --> 2645.62
right sorry I've distracted by a pretty

2640.52 --> 2652.24
good comment on Skype not related to

2645.62 --> 2652.24
anything but yeah

2671.18 --> 2674.18
No

2677.64 --> 2683.15
I'll stay you're not blocks why do you

2680.759 --> 2683.15
think that

2698.77 --> 2701.49
hmm

2704.4 --> 2718.1800000000003
maybe it's just a interface issues but

2707.74 --> 2722.3999999999996
no I don't block you master right but

2718.18 --> 2726.04
maybe there was like a connection delay

2722.4 --> 2728.14
like the connection wasn't being proper

2726.04 --> 2732.0299999999997
and you didn't notice and then the

2728.14 --> 2732.0299999999997
messages were lost it happens sometimes

2734.46 --> 2741.61
I've seen that happen myself like when I

2738.37 --> 2743.8599999999997
was typing in a chat and then as my

2741.61 --> 2747.4
internet connection was lost I don't see

2743.86 --> 2749.56
it at first and then suddenly messages

2747.4 --> 2752.11
in retrospect didn't seem to have

2749.56 --> 2755.34
arrived even though you saw as if they

2752.11 --> 2755.34
did I don't know

2763.93 --> 2768.37
right sir slick James

2772.42 --> 2786.4700000000003
got so many windows open zombies and I

2781.55 --> 2788.8590000000004
have so many pictures on my on my

2786.47 --> 2788.859
desktop

2815.45 --> 2823.069
yeah but anyway it's like James I think

2820.52 --> 2830.21
I'm gonna like change the color scape I

2823.069 --> 2831.74
could do that get the Hat brown instead

2830.21 --> 2837.5
of blue shouldn't be too hard

2831.74 --> 2839.2099999999996
filtering then hmm yeah get I probably

2837.5 --> 2840.92
need another image like one where he

2839.21 --> 2842.41
kind of looked startled or something or

2840.92 --> 2844.91
really pissed off

2842.41 --> 2847.0099999999998
not this happy face that doesn't make

2844.91 --> 2849.44
any sense for the context of what I want

2847.01 --> 2853.4300000000003
to make it just get his head and then

2849.44 --> 2855.53
get like a Python from from the jungle

2853.43 --> 2857.1499999999996
book one of those moments when he's

2855.53 --> 2864.94
wrapping around Mowgli then headed away

2857.15 --> 2864.94
Mowgli and then put him instead there

2865.15 --> 2871.04
should be doable but it's probably gonna

2868.67 --> 2874.4500000000003
take a while so did I definitely not

2871.04 --> 2878.95
gonna be able to do that in 10 minutes

2874.45 --> 2887.5989999999997
no no come on no I'm not gonna go there

2878.95 --> 2893.0589999999997
Rasta you know it no that's just Rasta

2887.599 --> 2895.94
sometimes she can be the worst although

2893.059 --> 2899.1800000000003
I kind of agree but you have to realize

2895.94 --> 2902.589
though there is like a connotation to

2899.18 --> 2907.24
that you know calling black people

2902.589 --> 2910.75
monkeys and all that it's just too many

2907.24 --> 2914.3289999999997
cultural references to get pissed off at

2910.75 --> 2917.109
so I'd rather come compare him to yea

2914.329 --> 2919.6090000000004
[ __ ] annoying little mouse

2917.109 --> 2925.94
especially in the context of the snakes

2919.609 --> 2930.0099999999998
is constantly yeah in between I think

2925.94 --> 2930.01
that's more appropriate

2935.9 --> 2943.77
although yeah like technically if you're

2940.8 --> 2947.48
gonna talk about behavior yeah he is

2943.77 --> 2951.0
kind of behaving like an ape like an ape

2947.48 --> 2953.04
not gonna call him that but I see the

2951.0 --> 2959.79
similarities behavior wise with the

2953.04 --> 2962.6
typical dominance and being proud of bad

2959.79 --> 2968.93
behavior and just be trying to dominate

2962.6 --> 2977.22
all that a typical gorilla behavior

2968.93 --> 2986.99
threatening hmm so I get it but it's not

2977.22 --> 2986.99
as funny as Fievel because of the Hat

2990.94 --> 2996.339
now if you look hard enough you'd

2992.71 --> 2998.619
probably be able to find some old movie

2996.339 --> 3001.589
with a monkey in it that is hat and

2998.619 --> 3003.539
wearing a hat so who knows who knows

3001.589 --> 3006.839
what will come out of this

3003.539 --> 3009.69
what kind of troll is listening in to

3006.839 --> 3014.819
thinking oh yeah I'm gonna like totally

3009.69 --> 3017.539
mess this up now I'm gonna try to be a

3014.819 --> 3017.5389999999998
little bit more soul

3036.62 --> 3039.77
[Music]

3045.39 --> 3050.7799999999997
okay I'm gonna attempt to make a risky

3048.33 --> 3054.69
joke this is terrible announcing it but

3050.78 --> 3055.59
right it's really I don't know maybe you

3054.69 --> 3059.13
appreciate it

3055.59 --> 3060.2400000000002
it's very unusual for me but think about

3059.13 --> 3066.3900000000003
it's a short joke

3060.24 --> 3070.52
so a honky and a [ __ ] walk into a bar

3066.39 --> 3080.5499999999997
and what do you think they're gonna ask

3070.52 --> 3083.66
the bartender you guess they're gonna

3080.55 --> 3087.2000000000003
tell it's not a [ __ ] funny joke

3083.66 --> 3087.2
you're racist

3087.92 --> 3100.29
sorry MIT that's terrible

3090.75 --> 3105.99
I didn't plan it out but you get it

3100.29 --> 3112.85
right it is properly balanced out I hope

3105.99 --> 3116.0899999999997
I don't know it is no I'm not afraid it

3112.85 --> 3116.0899999999997
it's good

3121.24 --> 3126.4599999999996
all right yeah well normally I never use

3124.15 --> 3135.64
the n-word in a conversation I never do

3126.46 --> 3138.76
a cracker right cracker but a honky is

3135.64 --> 3142.6299999999997
like also one of the words for it right

3138.76 --> 3145.9500000000003
if I remember correctly it's a very

3142.63 --> 3148.63
derogative towards white people right

3145.95 --> 3151.56
maybe maybe I'm just being culturally

3148.63 --> 3151.56
ignorant here

3152.28 --> 3155.4590000000003
[Music]

3157.74 --> 3168.2799999999997
right yeah and indeed the n-word is also

3161.56 --> 3170.35
blocked in the in my chats because I

3168.28 --> 3173.2900000000004
just don't like I don't like if black

3170.35 --> 3174.31
people start using the n-word and I

3173.29 --> 3181.77
don't like it

3174.31 --> 3184.6
if anyone pretty much does that so Wow

3181.77 --> 3188.73
Chris man I'm not a full Nazi mode it's

3184.6 --> 3188.73
just a joke come on guys

3201.27 --> 3207.5099999999998
but I'm not getting an answer to my

3203.76 --> 3211.07
question though like a donkey is a

3207.51 --> 3215.5800000000004
derogative word from generally a black

3211.07 --> 3219.3900000000003
person to a white person right correct

3215.58 --> 3227.21
is that correct or did I totally mess up

3219.39 --> 3227.21
the joke anyway

3229.22 --> 3235.2599999999998
for [ __ ] sake and somebody just

3231.81 --> 3236.64
answered the question right thank you

3235.26 --> 3239.55
thank you

3236.64 --> 3242.81
finally only took like three minutes

3239.55 --> 3242.8100000000004
[ __ ] sake

3243.95 --> 3259.52
right exactly so in that sense it's just

3251.66 --> 3259.52
racist to both direction so I don't know

3265.46 --> 3271.04
I think I should probably not I think I

3268.49 --> 3273.56
made a mistake by asking the audience

3271.04 --> 3274.88
like what is he gonna ask it's basically

3273.56 --> 3277.88
more like a hard-hitter

3274.88 --> 3280.31
I guess I think I literally just screwed

3277.88 --> 3283.4300000000003
it up like this is very and comedian

3280.31 --> 3285.49
professional very stupid of me but

3283.43 --> 3288.56
basically should probably be like okay d

3285.49 --> 3291.2299999999996
they've walked into the bar and tell the

3288.56 --> 3294.85
bartender it's not a [ __ ] funny joke

3291.23 --> 3297.35
what are you a racist or something

3294.85 --> 3299.27
that's the way just a very quick and

3297.35 --> 3302.66
then sadly it's left to the face like

3299.27 --> 3306.88
that I don't know I might try again

3302.66 --> 3309.5299999999997
sometimes or maybe I'm just gonna get

3306.88 --> 3312.25
blank stares from everyone like what the

3309.53 --> 3312.25
hell are you doing

3326.58 --> 3332.79
all right I definitely know that cracker

3328.92 --> 3336.63
is also a derogative term towards white

3332.79 --> 3339.39
people I think it's more specific like a

3336.63 --> 3343.76
honky was in indeed maybe more regional

3339.39 --> 3351.81
and a cracker is just white in general

3343.76 --> 3360.5400000000004
right yeah anyway is racism so you have

3351.81 --> 3362.1
to be very specific there anyway like if

3360.54 --> 3365.34
somebody is going to be derogative

3362.1 --> 3368.27
towards you then it's important to know

3365.34 --> 3368.27
exactly how

3389.68 --> 3398.73
all right

3392.47 --> 3398.73
that's where David read because in a way

3398.79 --> 3406.359
like my youth was basically before

3402.839 --> 3411.7
things like gangster rap took over in

3406.359 --> 3414.819
the 90s and all that so when I was young

3411.7 --> 3417.0099999999998
I would to be fair I would kind of also

3414.819 --> 3420.7599999999998
and also because I was always nervous

3417.01 --> 3422.94
about it because I would kind of like

3420.76 --> 3426.28
with my with my brother just like

3422.94 --> 3430.03
fooling around poking and being naughty

3426.28 --> 3432.6400000000003
make fun of black people but not like oh

3430.03 --> 3435.55
they're so they're all evil or nothing

3432.64 --> 3439.93
like that but we were we just thought

3435.55 --> 3442.0890000000004
that like real native Africans that

3439.93 --> 3445.8289999999997
would for example come over were just

3442.089 --> 3449.98
kind of odd and we thought it was funny

3445.829 --> 3451.9
see it was kind of like serious cultural

3449.98 --> 3454.93
differences and we just thought like

3451.9 --> 3460.17
that's kind of funny and we kind of made

3454.93 --> 3460.1699999999996
our own weird cartoonish jokes with it

3462.89 --> 3467.0899999999997
but yeah then pretty much the 90s

3465.35 --> 3470.2999999999997
happens in gangster rap and that just

3467.09 --> 3470.8700000000003
completely ruined everything in and so

3470.3 --> 3472.46
leave

3470.87 --> 3475.1
black people were all getting all

3472.46 --> 3478.07
offended all race among all racism

3475.1 --> 3481.31
everyone was immediately it's not funny

3478.07 --> 3483.7400000000002
anymore and even if you're like

3481.31 --> 3490.61
genuinely just try to make a friendly

3483.74 --> 3492.7
joke my god no and except for the ultra

3490.61 --> 3494.84
liberals in their stand-up thingies

3492.7 --> 3497.06
although yeah they would

3494.84 --> 3502.07
in the Netherlands no in the Netherlands

3497.06 --> 3505.73
it was just completely white out so like

3502.07 --> 3509.8900000000003
walking on eggshells yeah Hollywood at

3505.73 --> 3512.69
least there they still weirdly enough

3509.89 --> 3515.75
think it's really funny to make super

3512.69 --> 3520.73
racist jokes sometimes I guess among

3515.75 --> 3529.19
them I don't know maybe but everything

3520.73 --> 3532.28
changed in the 90s and yeah it wasn't

3529.19 --> 3536.4500000000003
funny anymore what we were doing so yeah

3532.28 --> 3542.6600000000003
pretty much died out and it's just like

3536.45 --> 3549.3799999999997
weird nostalgic memories now and I in a

3542.66 --> 3554.7999999999997
way it is nostalgic too because how do

3549.38 --> 3559.04
you say we had we had much better hopes

3554.8 --> 3561.1400000000003
for black people in general maybe we

3559.04 --> 3567.799
were just wise enough enough yet

3561.14 --> 3572.8689999999997
maybe well with it just

3567.799 --> 3574.92
it's a Yad it

3572.869 --> 3578.88
stumbling all around sorry about that

3574.92 --> 3582.089
now but it's not just the black people

3578.88 --> 3586.65
in the black regions or in the in Europe

3582.089 --> 3589.89
and America it's there's a lot of groups

3586.65 --> 3596.88
that are just under pressure and in

3589.89 --> 3601.3799999999997
trouble and like losing their cultural

3596.88 --> 3603.63
strengths and definitely like native

3601.38 --> 3606.44
Europeans are also among them but

3603.63 --> 3611.2200000000003
they've been subjected for a long time

3606.44 --> 3613.98
kind of try to adapted but I didn't see

3611.22 --> 3616.6499999999996
all that in the 90s as a kid I had no

3613.98 --> 3618.63
idea no overs I literally just didn't

3616.65 --> 3621.2400000000002
look at it because like that's politics

3618.63 --> 3629.4500000000003
it's too much out there I didn't realize

3621.24 --> 3634.7299999999996
that that is the world I would work yeah

3629.45 --> 3634.73
anyway it's getting kind of weird

3644.18 --> 3649.46
I just it's weird because I just wish

3647.119 --> 3651.529
kind of like the whole gangster

3649.46 --> 3657.799
situation would just go away

3651.529 --> 3661.789
and well get yeah get that out of there

3657.799 --> 3663.829
out of out of the black community where

3661.789 --> 3668.6600000000003
it is kind of predominant not with all

3663.829 --> 3672.38
of them but in the super huge cities the

3668.66 --> 3676.0389999999998
mega cities and all that get it out of

3672.38 --> 3682.9700000000003
there and just let let these people

3676.039 --> 3685.099
recover in a more sensible way I think

3682.97 --> 3688.45
just they'll gangster rap [ __ ] and

3685.099 --> 3688.4500000000003
they'll just ruin it

3694.76 --> 3701.69
ah but maybe I'm just over generalizing

3698.51 --> 3704.9900000000002
I'm not saying that anyone that would

3701.69 --> 3706.73
like gangster rap or like feel

3704.99 --> 3709.81
comfortable with that music in the

3706.73 --> 3712.1
background not really listening to it

3709.81 --> 3715.58
I'm not saying that you're bad if that's

3712.1 --> 3720.2
the case absolutely it's not about that

3715.58 --> 3722.7799999999997
but it was just pushed it was pushed on

3720.2 --> 3725.39
younger people that do really listen to

3722.78 --> 3729.46
the lyrics and try to be like that that

3725.39 --> 3732.58
really happened and that ruined so much

3729.46 --> 3732.58
you know

3736.18 --> 3741.0099999999998
and technically yeah you could say it

3738.28 --> 3743.05
was spurred on or at least tolerated by

3741.01 --> 3746.32
the government it pretty much happened

3743.05 --> 3748.63
through media and the music industry and

3746.32 --> 3750.8700000000003
the government just let it happen and

3748.63 --> 3750.87
just

3759.87 --> 3763.29
they were probably counting on it or

3762.45 --> 3764.8799999999997
planning it or

3763.29 --> 3767.07
I don't know directly the involvement

3764.88 --> 3768.9300000000003
because the their most erect eyes are of

3767.07 --> 3771.03
course with the media and the music

3768.93 --> 3776.7
industry those are the one that are

3771.03 --> 3778.7400000000002
making those products so about how

3776.7 --> 3780.8399999999997
everything else social engineering wise

3778.74 --> 3783.6899999999996
was originally set up is much more

3780.84 --> 3787.11
complex and fast so it's very tough to

3783.69 --> 3789.48
point as a single person there anyway

3787.11 --> 3793.53
yeah this has been a weird stream I kind

3789.48 --> 3795.72
of feel weird about it that joke I

3793.53 --> 3797.67
wouldn't be surprised if now there would

3795.72 --> 3799.5
be some kind of weird sock films about

3797.67 --> 3804.05
me saying that over and over again or

3799.5 --> 3807.2
something I don't know I'll just have to

3804.05 --> 3809.61
sit through whatever comes my way I

3807.2 --> 3812.22
don't know I personally don't feel

3809.61 --> 3815.13
guilty about it at all because it's just

3812.22 --> 3819.81
proper setup it's joke it's balanced and

3815.13 --> 3821.28
I don't know I do like it's kind of the

3819.81 --> 3824.16
thing that I really appreciate about

3821.28 --> 3828.03
Owen Benjamin as well that he does joke

3824.16 --> 3832.68
with and he's really testing that and I

3828.03 --> 3836.01
have respect for that but yeah you know

3832.68 --> 3840.83
he's a proper comedian I can be funny I

3836.01 --> 3840.8300000000004
guess I'm not a comedian so not really I

3842.87 --> 3849.15
can try sometimes so anyway yeah I'm

3847.47 --> 3850.83
