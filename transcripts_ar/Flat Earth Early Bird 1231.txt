bright sun

123.759 --> 128.239
there's all kinds of like fluffies going

126.079 --> 131.44
around so i think that like there's a

128.239 --> 133.76
certain type of tree in the area

131.44 --> 136.4
and they

133.76 --> 138.56
yeah they just throw off the fl these

136.4 --> 140.16
fluffies and since yesterday like

138.56 --> 142.38
they've been hanging around in the air

140.16 --> 143.76
especially in the evening a lot

142.38 --> 145.51999999999998
[Music]

143.76 --> 148.0
this is like like

145.52 --> 150.959
pieces of cotton balls are just flying

148.0 --> 150.959
around all the time

152.4 --> 157.0
but it is a super beautiful day

157.92 --> 161.11999999999998
nice and warm

159.76 --> 163.44
a lot of people

161.12 --> 166.64000000000001
are enjoying the weather outside my

163.44 --> 168.4
roommate is actually sitting

166.64 --> 170.16
one balcony down

168.4 --> 171.04
in front of the front door just reading

170.16 --> 172.879
a

171.04 --> 175.28
i don't know something on his laptop in

172.879 --> 178.239
the sun

175.28 --> 178.239
not a bad idea

178.64 --> 184.319
right and kids outside are just like

181.44 --> 186.48
enjoying and

184.319 --> 189.51899999999998
playing around

186.48 --> 194.0
especially back there

189.519 --> 194.0
the playground behind the trees here

194.159 --> 197.519
so yeah beautiful day

197.68 --> 201.28
all right

198.56 --> 201.28
camera freeze

201.519 --> 203.92000000000002
all right

210.08 --> 216.0
right let's look up the temperature by

212.239 --> 217.68
the way hello wrath first in chat

216.0 --> 222.12
it is monday

217.68 --> 222.12
the 2nd of may 2022.

224.959 --> 227.84
see

234.0 --> 238.2
yeah it's 18 degrees celsius

243.76 --> 249.2
right

245.439 --> 253.07999999999998
very low humidity only 40 percent

249.2 --> 253.07999999999998
right beautiful weather

255.04 --> 259.359
all right so

257.04 --> 259.35900000000004
yeah

259.6 --> 263.32000000000005
i'm doing pretty good

268.24 --> 272.72
yeah

269.6 --> 275.04
i was going to bed decently in time is

272.72 --> 278.16
reeling doing me a lot of good

275.04 --> 278.16
so i'm keeping that up

278.8 --> 282.639
and yeah yesterday's show was

281.36 --> 284.24
great

282.639 --> 287.44
intense

284.24 --> 289.68
i did watch it back fully

287.44 --> 292.32
and yeah sometimes i'm a little

289.68 --> 293.919
surprised about just

292.32 --> 296.71999999999997
the focus

293.919 --> 299.75899999999996
that i have

296.72 --> 299.759
like is that me

300.639 --> 304.639
so yeah very satisfied about that

305.199 --> 307.52000000000004
uh

308.72 --> 316.72
hello jeff gas head iron 26 elise g

312.24 --> 316.72
turret 306 good to see you all

322.16 --> 325.68
what was i doing yesterday yeah i

323.919 --> 328.08
watched all the videos that were linked

325.68 --> 328.08
up to me

328.72 --> 334.8
also watched mind unveiled

332.32 --> 337.44
but monstrous races

334.8 --> 340.16
really freaky

337.44 --> 343.44
and but yeah there's a there's a yeah a

340.16 --> 345.199
weird there's of course a point to it

343.44 --> 346.8
and like i really like the train of

345.199 --> 348.96000000000004
thinking of how it was presented of

346.8 --> 351.96000000000004
course great imagery from books and all

348.96 --> 351.96
that

352.24 --> 357.199
but yeah

354.8 --> 357.199
weird

357.84 --> 363.19899999999996
yeah

359.44 --> 365.84
mutants it's like human mutants

363.199 --> 367.44
were everywhere and they they came forth

365.84 --> 369.67999999999995
from something

367.44 --> 369.68
like

374.0 --> 379.28
and it's so fascinating how like he even

377.039 --> 381.84
dug up like how in

379.28 --> 386.23999999999995
old christian books they were basically

381.84 --> 389.44
addressed like these are the monsters

386.24 --> 392.319
and that how even i myself way back

389.44 --> 394.56
thought like oh they they made it up

392.319 --> 396.8
to create a fictional enemy

394.56 --> 397.6
oh really but what if they weren't made

396.8 --> 399.759
up

397.6 --> 403.03900000000004
they were actually out there and they're

399.759 --> 407.199
still like weird remnants

403.039 --> 407.199
from you could say free flood

407.36 --> 412.88
so fascinating stuff

410.88 --> 415.599
mind unveiled check them out i think

412.88 --> 415.599
i'll link them up

415.68 --> 418.8
link up that video

419.759 --> 426.8
it's 15 minutes long

423.28 --> 426.79999999999995
but it's really interesting

430.24 --> 432.56
ah

433.12 --> 439.36
a can of bear

434.639 --> 439.36
leather sage wow everybody's in here

442.16 --> 445.84000000000003
right so that video made made quite an

444.88 --> 447.599
impact

445.84 --> 448.79999999999995
i mean it's not the first time that i've

447.599 --> 451.919
seen it but

448.8 --> 455.44
it was presented in a very

451.919 --> 458.639
smooth way that made helped me basically

455.44 --> 460.71999999999997
put things better in the place

458.639 --> 462.639
i think that when i was confronted with

460.72 --> 463.59900000000005
it in the past

462.639 --> 465.759
uh

463.599 --> 468.4
oh yeah apparently sean hawkins thinks

465.759 --> 470.08000000000004
i'm all the [ __ ] again he made three

468.4 --> 471.52
videos about me

470.08 --> 476.24
just taking

471.52 --> 476.24
snips snippets from my streams and then

476.8 --> 481.44
not even like saying anything on them

483.759 --> 488.319
like i think technically i could

485.68 --> 490.40000000000003
probably strike him for it but

488.319 --> 492.72
like is it even worth at this point i

490.4 --> 494.96
mean he literally doesn't understand

492.72 --> 497.28000000000003
what i'm talking about he's like oh look

494.96 --> 499.44
at this it's so ridiculous

497.28 --> 500.87899999999996
and he literally doesn't understand what

499.44 --> 503.039
i'm talking about

500.879 --> 507.47900000000004
like that's palpable

503.039 --> 507.479
literally doesn't understand it

508.0 --> 510.24
like

510.639 --> 512.96
yeah

513.039 --> 518.8
it's weird though that he does that

516.56 --> 518.8
uh

519.44 --> 522.08
what else

524.79 --> 527.929
[Music]

529.279 --> 534.8
oh yeah i did a bit of like

531.279 --> 537.2
soft flat smacking over at kent hovind

534.8 --> 538.8
i got in his live stream chat really

537.2 --> 541.0400000000001
early

538.8 --> 541.04
and

541.279 --> 545.6
yeah i decided to basically say like

543.68 --> 548.16
yeah

545.6 --> 550.24
like there is no biblical evidence for

548.16 --> 553.92
globe earth

550.24 --> 556.64
like it's flat stationary and closed and

553.92 --> 558.64
like physics backs that up

556.64 --> 560.3199999999999
and so does the bible

558.64 --> 562.72
because there's nothing to the contrary

560.32 --> 564.0
of that no matter how you approach the

562.72 --> 565.76
descriptions

564.0 --> 566.959
and yeah i got a couple of people in

565.76 --> 569.12
that chat

566.959 --> 571.1199999999999
quoting over it a bit but they seemed

569.12 --> 573.68
like they weren't like anti-flat

571.12 --> 575.519
earthers waiting in line to get go after

573.68 --> 577.279
me like they were not like super gamma

575.519 --> 579.2
or anything

577.279 --> 581.76
some of them might actually be like

579.2 --> 584.1600000000001
tuning in my stream right now i did

581.76 --> 586.72
actually ask him like hey dude

584.16 --> 589.04
you you you think you know this stuff

586.72 --> 591.2
like come over to my streams i do a show

589.04 --> 594.399
every day

591.2 --> 596.08
like over 1200 streams every day two

594.399 --> 597.6
hours talking about this stuff flat

596.08 --> 600.64
earth and

597.6 --> 602.16
and christ and everything so who knows

600.64 --> 604.399
some of them might be

602.16 --> 606.399
tuning in although it will probably be

604.399 --> 609.36
really early to them since they are in

606.399 --> 611.76
the united states most of them i think

609.36 --> 614.76
kent hovind followers

611.76 --> 614.76
uh

624.56 --> 627.56
hmm

632.56 --> 635.4399999999999
i think that was it

638.0 --> 641.48
he's a problem

648.45 --> 653.0400000000001
[Music]

651.2 --> 655.44
that's a pretty uh

653.04 --> 657.12
that sounds smooth that's like a that's

655.44 --> 658.9590000000001
almost like a character name that i

657.12 --> 661.12
would make

658.959 --> 662.56
if i if i did a dungeons and dragons

661.12 --> 664.8
campaign

662.56 --> 667.1199999999999
because i love to do that right

664.8 --> 668.8
take a person that's like really in a

667.12 --> 671.2
certain way

668.8 --> 672.8
and then make that into a

671.2 --> 675.0400000000001
a character in

672.8 --> 677.3599999999999
your game world

675.04 --> 680.16
especially if the people

677.36 --> 682.24
don't really know about it

680.16 --> 685.1999999999999
if they know about it they'll all be

682.24 --> 687.519
able to just fill it in right

685.2 --> 689.76
and just think of it like they would

687.519 --> 691.279
think of it in their lives

689.76 --> 692.399
if they don't know the character in

691.279 --> 694.16
detail

692.399 --> 696.8
then it's like

694.16 --> 700.16
a more serious emulation than to me the

696.8 --> 702.88
game master it's a puzzle to put it down

700.16 --> 705.36
and to see if they understand it

702.88 --> 707.04
like as if it were the real person

705.36 --> 710.32
and then they to them it's like a

707.04 --> 710.3199999999999
mystery i like doing that

711.04 --> 717.68
sub simulation anyway

713.6 --> 720.8000000000001
like if i had a sean hawkins character

717.68 --> 723.4399999999999
and i kind of wanted to hide it

720.8 --> 728.92
i would call him prong shotguns

723.44 --> 728.9200000000001
i would it's a really well-picked name

732.16 --> 740.519
oh yeah and the documents

735.519 --> 740.519
they changed almost all of it what

744.48 --> 748.48
weird

745.519 --> 751.68
because i did watch the video

748.48 --> 751.6800000000001
it was a two-parter

752.16 --> 757.519
first part was about like yugoslavia the

755.12 --> 759.68
secret space program of yugoslavia

757.519 --> 761.44
really fascinating it's not the first

759.68 --> 763.519
time i've seen that but i completely

761.44 --> 766.32
forgot about it

763.519 --> 768.44
fascinating really fascinating

766.32 --> 771.2
and the second half was like the

768.44 --> 774.72
conspiracy theory

771.2 --> 774.72
the flashy series

777.12 --> 781.839
with yeah about the moon landing that

779.36 --> 784.32
was like stuck to it

781.839 --> 786.9590000000001
it was pretty decent but it's weird also

784.32 --> 789.519
watching back and just seeing knowing

786.959 --> 793.04
now like how much of the ideas that they

789.519 --> 795.92
were inserting were also plans

793.04 --> 798.16
it is it's fascinating

795.92 --> 801.1999999999999
i mean i don't really enjoy those types

798.16 --> 803.92
of videos anymore but it's interesting

801.2 --> 803.9200000000001
watching back

804.72 --> 809.839
and yeah the series conspiracy theory

807.04 --> 811.76
was really something else

809.839 --> 814.72
still remember all those episodes with

811.76 --> 817.2
when it was still with jesse ventura

814.72 --> 820.0
and like alex jones came on there

817.2 --> 821.0400000000001
and then at some point that broke

820.0 --> 823.92
i think

821.04 --> 825.199
it just didn't work

823.92 --> 827.199
but yeah there has been more and

825.199 --> 830.16
apparently they do like a moon landing

827.199 --> 834.0
item and i mean

830.16 --> 837.199
it wasn't even all that bad

834.0 --> 839.519
it wasn't just like oh it's just nutty

837.199 --> 841.199
no no it were pretty decent leads it's

839.519 --> 843.44
on the surface but they were pretty

841.199 --> 845.92
decent leads

843.44 --> 848.72
right it seemed neutral

845.92 --> 850.16
and yeah i can appreciate that

848.72 --> 853.0400000000001
it wasn't bad

850.16 --> 854.959
like for a video that was been like

853.04 --> 856.8
15 years or something that's pretty

854.959 --> 859.5189999999999
decent

856.8 --> 861.519
for the time anyway

859.519 --> 865.36
original video is ten times better yeah

861.519 --> 865.36
i well sorry tony whitcomb i

865.519 --> 869.92
you'll have to link me up with that one

867.6 --> 872.9200000000001
then because that's not what i watched i

869.92 --> 872.92
guess

891.36 --> 896.0790000000001
hmm

893.12 --> 900.16
right but i guess that you found back a

896.079 --> 902.6389999999999
part of it right it was just kind of cut

900.16 --> 904.8
down or something

902.639 --> 906.9590000000001
right well if you managed to find the

904.8 --> 908.4799999999999
original full version

906.959 --> 910.56
let me know

908.48 --> 913.04
because i did think especially like if

910.56 --> 914.2399999999999
it is more related to that yugoslavia

913.04 --> 917.12
thing

914.24 --> 919.92
it's really fascinating like holy [ __ ]

917.12 --> 921.76
man they had like this

919.92 --> 925.68
giant

921.76 --> 927.92
hidden space program really fascinating

925.68 --> 929.199
like oh my god that's so freaking

927.92 --> 930.56
inspiring

929.199 --> 932.16
like

930.56 --> 934.8
if you just

932.16 --> 936.959
realize that and that it's been secret

934.8 --> 938.88
and it's still not very widely known

936.959 --> 942.2399999999999
then

938.88 --> 944.56
man that's like such an inspiration in

942.24 --> 946.16
general for like

944.56 --> 947.92
sci-fi

946.16 --> 949.279
things

947.92 --> 951.12
i don't know

949.279 --> 953.6
it's just

951.12 --> 956.16
kind of mind-blowing to

953.6 --> 958.16
watch that back and remember like oh

956.16 --> 959.92
[ __ ]

958.16 --> 960.88
damn

959.92 --> 962.7199999999999
i mean

960.88 --> 965.04
like technically it's pointless right

962.72 --> 967.0400000000001
space program no they're going to the

965.04 --> 969.8389999999999
moon first no

967.04 --> 972.0
that still isn't possible but they did

969.839 --> 975.9590000000001
build all that

972.0 --> 975.959
and that's really fascinating

988.56 --> 992.399
anyway it's still it was still a good

990.399 --> 994.56
video it's good to be reminded about

992.399 --> 997.8
that tony whitcomb thank you

994.56 --> 997.8
good links

999.199 --> 1006.4399999999999
what was the other one

1001.839 --> 1006.44
or two links yesterday i got

1019.199 --> 1025.76
oh yeah the vortex mechanics from elys g

1023.04 --> 1028.0
yeah yeah well that's mostly it was

1025.76 --> 1031.919
mostly a visual video

1028.0 --> 1031.919
about fractal patterns and

1032.079 --> 1036.079
yeah i linked it up with

1034.16 --> 1039.559
with brian

1036.079 --> 1039.559
brian's logic

1040.559 --> 1046.039
it's more down his lane but yeah i also

1042.559 --> 1046.039
checked that out

1056.88 --> 1062.4
man

1058.4 --> 1065.2800000000002
i'm feeling some stiffness these last

1062.4 --> 1068.0800000000002
few weeks so yeah i realized they still

1065.28 --> 1069.9189999999999
had one of these in my in my

1068.08 --> 1073.6789999999999
cooler

1069.919 --> 1077.8400000000001
and it was closed like all this time so

1073.679 --> 1077.8400000000001
i'm gonna try some of this tumeric

1079.44 --> 1083.039
ginger chili juice

1083.36 --> 1087.76
and just see if that happens if that

1085.28 --> 1092.6
actually changes my condition makes me

1087.76 --> 1092.6
less stiff over the next few days

1094.4 --> 1096.72
ah

1102.559 --> 1106.48
the premise of the documents that the

1104.24 --> 1109.84
usa got scammed by title and yugoslavia

1106.48 --> 1109.84
in this table wow

1111.919 --> 1115.72
yeah that is pretty remarkable

1125.6 --> 1128.9599999999998
right yeah tony now i really want to

1127.52 --> 1131.6
know more

1128.96 --> 1131.6000000000001
about that

1131.919 --> 1138.0800000000002
like how did he do that

1135.28 --> 1140.799
like did he not deliver

1138.08 --> 1143.6789999999999
did he over promise

1140.799 --> 1145.6
like the capabilities of of his devices

1143.679 --> 1147.6000000000001
and the usa

1145.6 --> 1148.84
played into that they basically took his

1147.6 --> 1151.4399999999998
bluff like

1148.84 --> 1155.039
how did he scan them

1151.44 --> 1159.039
scan them i wonder like yeah the video

1155.039 --> 1159.039
you sent me didn't get to that point

1159.84 --> 1164.24
it like it only came to the point where

1161.679 --> 1167.039
it says like oh there was like a session

1164.24 --> 1168.799
an assassination attempt or something

1167.039 --> 1170.48
and that's it that's when the video kind

1168.799 --> 1173.52
of cut off after that point didn't

1170.48 --> 1177.559
really get onto like any scam that

1173.52 --> 1177.559
supposedly happened so

1178.86 --> 1182.1499999999999
[Music]

1191.84 --> 1194.72
right but yeah i guess you could say

1193.919 --> 1198.96
like

1194.72 --> 1198.96
he out nassad nasa

1199.28 --> 1203.76
like nasa is there to basically promise

1201.919 --> 1205.8400000000001
[ __ ]

1203.76 --> 1207.679
the ones that actually build the program

1205.84 --> 1210.559
know that

1207.679 --> 1213.1200000000001
and then an outsider this guy managed to

1210.559 --> 1215.36
basically fool them into believing it

1213.12 --> 1217.84
was real again with that like something

1215.36 --> 1217.84
like that

1219.44 --> 1223.8400000000001
oh yeah that would i guess really piss

1222.4 --> 1227.039
me off too

1223.84 --> 1229.36
if i was subjected to that then again i

1227.039 --> 1232.559
would have have to be like

1229.36 --> 1234.799
a nasa organizer and thus a complete

1232.559 --> 1237.039
piece of trash

1234.799 --> 1237.039
so

1237.76 --> 1240.76
huh

1248.159 --> 1253.7600000000002
the blueprints for the space of the

1250.4 --> 1257.96
space program didn't work

1253.76 --> 1257.96
crap cars that's weird

1266.159 --> 1271.6000000000001
it's weird isn't it it almost sounds a

1268.72 --> 1276.28
bit elon musky

1271.6 --> 1276.28
i mean crap cars that don't work

1278.4 --> 1284.0
like how much of his supposed space

1280.88 --> 1286.0800000000002
stuff does actually work

1284.0 --> 1289.039
and how much of it is cgi and like

1286.08 --> 1291.12
because he's not even the only one right

1289.039 --> 1293.6
there's a lot of questions with bezos

1291.12 --> 1297.84
blue origin stuff like how much of that

1293.6 --> 1297.84
is actually physically happening

1299.36 --> 1305.9189999999999
seems like there's cgi getting involved

1303.2 --> 1308.48
so how much is it if it is really real

1305.919 --> 1312.039
or is it just staged and just glued

1308.48 --> 1312.039
together with cgi

1321.2 --> 1326.64
yeah borders boy i know yeah yugoslavia

1324.08 --> 1330.12
was a giant tragedy

1326.64 --> 1330.1200000000001
it was monstrous

1356.559 --> 1359.559
hmm

1376.88 --> 1381.1200000000001
next they will send rockets downward

1379.039 --> 1384.12
what are you talking about other andrew

1381.12 --> 1384.12
what

1395.2 --> 1399.8400000000001
oh yeah i've been hearing by the way

1396.799 --> 1399.84
that supposedly

1399.919 --> 1404.24
russia is kind of like abandoning the

1402.559 --> 1406.0
iss now

1404.24 --> 1411.0
i mean i've read some

1406.0 --> 1411.0
i read some headlines in rt

1417.28 --> 1424.3999999999999
so like there's there is some

1421.039 --> 1427.279
some actual splitting up going on here

1424.4 --> 1429.44
like this is no longer like a friendly

1427.279 --> 1431.84
bro brawl there seems to be like real

1429.44 --> 1435.1200000000001
divorce elements now even in the

1431.84 --> 1437.36
wizardry starting to occur

1435.12 --> 1437.36
so

1437.76 --> 1444.32
like death signals to me that

1441.2 --> 1445.919
like things can get like pretty damn

1444.32 --> 1448.6399999999999
serious

1445.919 --> 1451.3600000000001
potentially

1448.64 --> 1454.48
but it just seems like the entire

1451.36 --> 1455.84
situation really is

1454.48 --> 1457.76
all about

1455.84 --> 1461.36
globalism just

1457.76 --> 1464.24
trying to make the other

1461.36 --> 1467.52
to agitate them it's like globalism at

1464.24 --> 1468.799
this point is like a hysterical

1467.52 --> 1469.76
woman

1468.799 --> 1473.84
on her

1469.76 --> 1476.799
last period ever or something right

1473.84 --> 1480.559
and just like doing anything that

1476.799 --> 1481.52
like the stupid trial [ __ ] with you know

1480.559 --> 1483.2
who

1481.52 --> 1486.559
that you can never get out of your

1483.2 --> 1487.44
recommended list from youtube

1486.559 --> 1490.1589999999999
uh

1487.44 --> 1492.96
stupid trials it's like yeah globalism

1490.159 --> 1494.5590000000002
is just [ __ ] on russia's best side

1492.96 --> 1496.24
of the bed

1494.559 --> 1497.76
right

1496.24 --> 1499.279
that seems to be what's happening

1497.76 --> 1502.32
because

1499.279 --> 1505.2
other than just like

1502.32 --> 1508.8799999999999
gamma sabotage [ __ ] just sending money

1505.2 --> 1511.039
to the wrong guy it's like oh i got this

1508.88 --> 1512.72
sexy neighbor guy that's really

1511.039 --> 1516.24
untrustworthy and he kind of tends to

1512.72 --> 1518.72
steal stuff yeah i'm i'm gonna he's my

1516.24 --> 1520.0
best friend now and he's gonna come in

1518.72 --> 1521.6000000000001
this home

1520.0 --> 1523.36
it's kind of that sort of crazy

1521.6 --> 1524.3999999999999
situation

1523.36 --> 1526.32
right

1524.4 --> 1528.799
they're just like

1526.32 --> 1531.2
passive aggressively sabotaging

1528.799 --> 1535.2
everything while being blabber mouth

1531.2 --> 1537.8400000000001
hysterical and megalomaniacal

1535.2 --> 1540.24
and it's like yeah the husband in this

1537.84 --> 1544.3999999999999
case putin russia

1540.24 --> 1545.6
is like being put in a spot like yeah

1544.4 --> 1546.72
okay

1545.6 --> 1548.9599999999998
well

1546.72 --> 1551.6000000000001
i guess we're gonna have a divorce then

1548.96 --> 1553.76
because this is like the the house is

1551.6 --> 1555.76
gonna burn down at some point if this

1553.76 --> 1557.6
keeps up

1555.76 --> 1559.039
that that's what it feels like to me i

1557.6 --> 1562.52
hope you guys

1559.039 --> 1562.52
understand that

1576.48 --> 1582.159
not talking about political theater

1580.48 --> 1583.6
i'm talking about

1582.159 --> 1585.679
the relations

1583.6 --> 1588.32
it's relation not about the theater not

1585.679 --> 1590.3200000000002
about how they want people to believe in

1588.32 --> 1591.6
what they're doing etc that's not what

1590.32 --> 1593.84
i'm talking about

1591.6 --> 1596.08
i'm not talking about

1593.84 --> 1598.9599999999998
them addressing the children i'm talking

1596.08 --> 1602.96
about their own interactions like

1598.96 --> 1604.08
including in the bedroom and just

1602.96 --> 1606.559
crazy

1604.08 --> 1606.559
parents

1607.6 --> 1613.36
and i've been through that [ __ ] not well

1611.679 --> 1615.52
i don't think my mom ever [ __ ] on my

1613.36 --> 1617.36
dad's bed

1615.52 --> 1620.08
but almost

1617.36 --> 1623.1999999999998
like a lot of other [ __ ] like breaking

1620.08 --> 1625.36
stuff and just the psychological

1623.2 --> 1628.4
relentless attacks

1625.36 --> 1632.0
and like my dad was always to blame and

1628.4 --> 1635.52
like my mom would literally

1632.0 --> 1637.84
kind of ride on the trendiness like in

1635.52 --> 1640.0
the 90s of oh

1637.84 --> 1642.399
damn dad get him out of the house she

1640.0 --> 1646.08
was like playing onto that and then kind

1642.399 --> 1648.32
of dragging us me especially into that

1646.08 --> 1650.8799999999999
so at first i was like yeah dad that's

1648.32 --> 1653.6789999999999
always stupid that is bad

1650.88 --> 1655.5200000000002
i was basically like indoctrinated

1653.679 --> 1658.0
yeah but i couldn't do anything about it

1655.52 --> 1660.72
i did not know

1658.0 --> 1663.44
how to deal with the situation

1660.72 --> 1665.919
eventually i turned from oh that is all

1663.44 --> 1668.559
just bad to

1665.919 --> 1670.48
actually understanding like wait he is

1668.559 --> 1674.32
really in a difficult position and he

1670.48 --> 1675.919
doesn't he's not belligerent

1674.32 --> 1677.84
he just doesn't really know what to do

1675.919 --> 1679.919
with this [ __ ] and that's when i started

1677.84 --> 1683.4399999999998
to embrace like okay i guess i have to

1679.919 --> 1684.96
be a psychology then between them

1683.44 --> 1687.1200000000001
and if that doesn't work then they

1684.96 --> 1688.08
really have to break up because this is

1687.12 --> 1690.8799999999999
just

1688.08 --> 1692.1589999999999
this just always crap

1690.88 --> 1694.24
everywhere

1692.159 --> 1696.48
not literally

1694.24 --> 1699.1200000000001
always a hassle people were trying to

1696.48 --> 1702.08
avoid our family because of the

1699.12 --> 1706.08
interactions between my mom and my dad

1702.08 --> 1706.08
because my mom was always bickering

1708.84 --> 1713.6789999999999
right

1710.399 --> 1716.7199999999998
so yeah there is there does seem to be

1713.679 --> 1719.1200000000001
like a real split up it's not just tak

1716.72 --> 1721.52
team oh we're having a

1719.12 --> 1723.52
a special fight in in wrestling or

1721.52 --> 1726.24
something between two rifles it's not

1723.52 --> 1728.32
like that it's that behind the scenes

1726.24 --> 1730.559
like they are

1728.32 --> 1733.12
seeming they seem to be actually

1730.559 --> 1736.559
splitting up right it's like the the

1733.12 --> 1738.2399999999998
covert bro contract might be broken

1736.559 --> 1741.12
actually

1738.24 --> 1743.919
which is a tragedy it is a tragedy if

1741.12 --> 1746.9599999999998
that happens the potential

1743.919 --> 1746.96
potential of it all

1748.32 --> 1752.96
it will be wasted it will be lost

1750.72 --> 1755.52
and it will probably not be able to be

1752.96 --> 1757.039
restored i mean like after [ __ ] goes

1755.52 --> 1759.84
down

1757.039 --> 1760.799
like between parents that bad for a long

1759.84 --> 1763.279
time

1760.799 --> 1764.84
and they split apart they're never gonna

1763.279 --> 1769.12
come back together you

1764.84 --> 1769.12
see it won't be possible

1769.919 --> 1773.8400000000001
they'll just

1772.159 --> 1777.919
the chemistry would be gone there would

1773.84 --> 1777.9189999999999
be no more play it would just be like

1779.2 --> 1782.32
they can't be trusted

1782.88 --> 1789.1200000000001
right and not just on the surface for

1785.279 --> 1791.44
the people because they were told oh

1789.12 --> 1793.4399999999998
through propaganda right because that is

1791.44 --> 1795.6000000000001
like the children that's the people

1793.44 --> 1796.88
that's the propaganda they're rolling

1795.6 --> 1799.76
out about each other that's still

1796.88 --> 1802.5590000000002
potentially tag team situation

1799.76 --> 1805.279
but if like they're actually severing

1802.559 --> 1806.1589999999999
connections like with covert programs

1805.279 --> 1810.159
then

1806.159 --> 1810.159
then it's a real breakup you see

1816.64 --> 1820.3990000000001
what do you mean

1818.32 --> 1822.96
10 levels down the rabbit hole we will

1820.399 --> 1824.559
never know [ __ ] what do you mean we

1822.96 --> 1826.799
will never know

1824.559 --> 1828.32
you'll never know if you don't put your

1826.799 --> 1829.9189999999999
mind around it if you don't try to

1828.32 --> 1830.6399999999999
figure out what's actually going on if

1829.919 --> 1832.88
you

1830.64 --> 1833.679
if you settle

1832.88 --> 1835.7600000000002
for

1833.679 --> 1838.5590000000002
anything and that you know enough

1835.76 --> 1840.399
supposedly yeah

1838.559 --> 1842.72
then you will never know

1840.399 --> 1844.6399999999999
i don't do that i try to figure things

1842.72 --> 1849.48
out and i cross-reference it with

1844.64 --> 1849.48
everything i've ever learned

1850.48 --> 1856.48
because it's all the same patterns all

1852.88 --> 1859.919
of it is on every level it's one pattern

1856.48 --> 1862.08
everything that happens is one singular

1859.919 --> 1865.8400000000001
pattern the pattern it's what i

1862.08 --> 1869.6
discovered philosophically when i was 17

1865.84 --> 1872.72
it's all one single pattern

1869.6 --> 1875.039
like one giant super complex fractal

1872.72 --> 1877.84
inter-dimensional fractal

1875.039 --> 1880.0
and that's that is the akashic library

1877.84 --> 1883.76
that is what it is

1880.0 --> 1883.76
it's the full picture

1885.12 --> 1891.6
and we can only look at parts of it at a

1888.48 --> 1894.88
time through our rose color darkly

1891.6 --> 1897.36
but it is a picture and we know it is we

1894.88 --> 1899.6000000000001
should know i know it is a picture and

1897.36 --> 1901.84
it is full and i can only watch one part

1899.6 --> 1904.32
at the same time but

1901.84 --> 1906.1589999999999
like yeah just even if you watch like

1904.32 --> 1908.24
all these different puzzle pieces being

1906.159 --> 1909.919
in different relations to one another

1908.24 --> 1911.84
eventually

1909.919 --> 1914.72
if you don't give up if you don't

1911.84 --> 1917.279
fatigue you will start to connect more

1914.72 --> 1920.08
you will get a more complete picture

1917.279 --> 1922.159
even if you can only focus on one piece

1920.08 --> 1925.519
at a time

1922.159 --> 1926.3200000000002
figure it out don't settle

1925.519 --> 1928.64
don't

1926.32 --> 1931.36
degrade yourself

1928.64 --> 1933.76
intellectually and say that oh we could

1931.36 --> 1937.12
never know that how do you know

1933.76 --> 1939.519
why do you think you know

1937.12 --> 1942.32
does it make you feel smart to say oh we

1939.519 --> 1945.279
will never know or is it just kind of

1942.32 --> 1948.799
like giving up and then

1945.279 --> 1950.88
gaslighting to everybody like i

1948.799 --> 1953.2
am not able to figure it out so that

1950.88 --> 1956.48
means you won't be able either because

1953.2 --> 1956.48
i'm smarter than you

1961.12 --> 1966.4799999999998
we will be able to figure it out

1964.0 --> 1970.0
if you can get away

1966.48 --> 1972.799
from your own contemporary distractions

1970.0 --> 1975.799
long enough to get a grasp on the full

1972.799 --> 1975.799
picture

1980.53 --> 1984.27
[Music]

1986.66 --> 1990.15
[Music]

1992.399 --> 1998.2399999999998
but yes jason brown backing out of the

1994.64 --> 1998.24
iss seriously yes

1999.679 --> 2003.679
i link you up

2001.919 --> 2007.8400000000001
but i don't know what's gonna happen if

2003.679 --> 2007.8400000000001
i try to link up like an rt article

2011.039 --> 2018.12
you'd probably have to open it in some

2013.12 --> 2018.12
kind of vpn browser or something

2018.32 --> 2022.279
see if i can find it back

2034.24 --> 2037.36
i hope it's still there

2038.559 --> 2042.76
it was an article from yesterday

2047.919 --> 2051.919
crap

2049.839 --> 2053.52
i think

2051.919 --> 2056.24
yeah it's

2053.52 --> 2056.24
out of reach

2059.919 --> 2066.0
anyway i yeah i noticed that

2062.24 --> 2066.0
that that was apparently happening

2068.079 --> 2074.44
you might be able to find some articles

2070.96 --> 2074.44
about it yourself

2082.56 --> 2087.0
all right i think i found it

2095.599 --> 2100.56
all right yeah rt band i know

2097.839 --> 2102.56
but hey if you have a vpn browser like i

2100.56 --> 2104.64
use oracle

2102.56 --> 2108.359
you might still be able to actually

2104.64 --> 2108.359
check out this article

2158.88 --> 2163.6800000000003
getting only info

2160.72 --> 2165.1189999999997
from the omnidirectional sludge phone

2163.68 --> 2167.68
tv

2165.119 --> 2172.839
the getting information from the tv is

2167.68 --> 2172.839
completely pointless at this point

2173.52 --> 2179.28
the only way it it would have a point is

2177.04 --> 2181.839
so you can size up

2179.28 --> 2183.52
how much in the dark the average person

2181.839 --> 2185.7599999999998
is going to be that doesn't really want

2183.52 --> 2188.079
to know about it yeah that's what you

2185.76 --> 2190.8
can learn from that if you actually want

2188.079 --> 2193.76
to understand what the [ __ ] going on

2190.8 --> 2196.76
then tv is completely pointless

2193.76 --> 2196.76
completely

2220.56 --> 2227.2799999999997
and even the free vpn will

2223.28 --> 2229.0400000000004
get you into blocked sites

2227.28 --> 2231.52
i have no idea what you're talking about

2229.04 --> 2233.92
pjc net

2231.52 --> 2237.119
but yeah the thing about vpn is it's

2233.92 --> 2238.64
gonna try to create

2237.119 --> 2242.48
hub points

2238.64 --> 2245.2799999999997
with it yeah with root identities

2242.48 --> 2248.0
that aren't blocking those sites so

2245.28 --> 2250.96
yeah you might like be like oh okay i'm

2248.0 --> 2252.48
gonna watch this hey it's blocked

2250.96 --> 2255.599
what do you do

2252.48 --> 2257.92
refresh the vpn

2255.599 --> 2262.0
take another

2257.92 --> 2264.0
fake vantage point address and try again

2262.0 --> 2266.24
until you get a

2264.0 --> 2269.04
fake vantage point

2266.24 --> 2270.64
identification as it were

2269.04 --> 2272.88
that doesn't block it and then you will

2270.64 --> 2275.7599999999998
be able to see it so yeah it might not

2272.88 --> 2275.76
work right away

2276.16 --> 2283.64
that's you just refresh your vantage

2278.64 --> 2283.64
point for the vpn that's all

2284.48 --> 2287.48
hmm

2301.599 --> 2306.6400000000003
really

2303.119 --> 2306.6400000000003
is it working a firefox

2309.28 --> 2313.3590000000004
no

2311.44 --> 2317.599
that hasn't been working for me in

2313.359 --> 2317.5989999999997
firefox for like months now

2319.359 --> 2323.839
it just disconnects but it might be

2321.119 --> 2325.2000000000003
because it's the netherlands

2323.839 --> 2327.359
because like

2325.2 --> 2331.2799999999997
in the netherlands like the the

2327.359 --> 2334.0789999999997

for some reason they are all riding and

2334.079 --> 2338.6400000000003
betting on

2335.839 --> 2341.44
that russia is satan and needs to be

2338.64 --> 2343.2799999999997
destroyed at all cost or everybody dies

2341.44 --> 2345.359
that's what they think they're [ __ ]

2343.28 --> 2348.28
insane and they're projecting

2345.359 --> 2350.16
their own demonic

2350.16 --> 2354.3199999999997

2599.76 --> 2606.88
is exactly the opposite exactly the

2603.44 --> 2610.48
opposite and it will do it fanatically

2606.88 --> 2612.4
until these freaks have been routed

2610.48 --> 2615.599
routed

2612.4 --> 2618.319
and jailed or killed

damn

2651.2 --> 2655.839
well okay well tony whitcomb uh

2656.16 --> 2659.1189999999997
would you buy it

2659.44 --> 2666.16
maybe you could buy it for yourself

2663.52 --> 2667.7599999999998
or buy it twice make it or make a copy

2666.16 --> 2669.839
if that's possible they might have like

2667.76 --> 2671.0400000000004
really freaky copyright systems or

2669.839 --> 2675.96
whatever

2671.04 --> 2675.96
like that you won't be able to copy it

2679.76 --> 2684.8
a worthwhile movie to have

2682.48 --> 2687.8
i mean yeah it's twelve dollars i get it

2684.8 --> 2687.8
but

2690.0 --> 2695.68
sounds like they really

2692.24 --> 2698.56
put like cornered a market there

2695.68 --> 2699.839
like it's like yeah oh you want it you

2698.56 --> 2702.88
12

2699.839 --> 2704.48
you want info 12

2702.88 --> 2708.28

i wouldn't like it in russia

2732.72 --> 2739.48
it's too cold

2735.599 --> 2739.48
i don't speak russian

2746.96 --> 2751.599
and like what the hell am i even gonna

2748.8 --> 2755.6800000000003
do then after that like i don't think

2751.599 --> 2756.7200000000003
like cannabis is legal in russia

2755.68 --> 2761.04
yeah

2756.72 --> 2763.52
i am a cannabis smoker so

2761.04 --> 2766.319
unless somehow russia like really

2763.52 --> 2769.359
changes that without turning into just

2766.319 --> 2771.839
liberal western freaks instead like

2769.359 --> 2773.7599999999998
doing the same mistakes

2771.839 --> 2776.16
but if they just

2773.76 --> 2779.0400000000004
get a good

2776.16 --> 2782.24
legal position like on cannabis then

2779.04 --> 2784.0
yeah then it might be considerable to me

2782.24 --> 2786.0789999999997
then i might actually start to think

2784.0 --> 2790.56
like

2786.079 --> 2790.5600000000004
maybe i will just visit it now

2790.64 --> 2794.48
because at first i have to visit it

2792.319 --> 2796.0
before i can even think like oh let's

2794.48 --> 2797.44
move here

2796.0 --> 2799.04
how do you know you're going to move

2797.44 --> 2801.119
somewhere you can move somewhere and

2799.04 --> 2802.4
integrate if you haven't ever been there

2801.119 --> 2804.6400000000003
physically

2802.4 --> 2804.64
so

2808.88 --> 2814.319
what the hell are you talking about

2812.4 --> 2816.7200000000003
so you'd like to live in an ultra

2814.319 --> 2819.119
conservative stated also has liberal

2816.72 --> 2821.359
votes like what the [ __ ] are you talking

2819.119 --> 2821.359
about

2823.52 --> 2829.44
are you some political numpty

2826.96 --> 2830.88
oh true conservative state

2829.44 --> 2833.44
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

2830.88 --> 2835.76
talking about with anything

2833.44 --> 2837.44
sound like a squirt boy

2835.76 --> 2842.0
it's like oh

2837.44 --> 2845.119
if it's a restriction it's bat

2842.0 --> 2847.2
more freedom more

2845.119 --> 2850.2400000000002
room and like

2847.2 --> 2852.64
blindness so everybody can turn as

2850.24 --> 2855.359
maniacal and demonic as we could

2852.64 --> 2858.5589999999997
possibly imagine

2855.359 --> 2860.18
oh if you're against that you're ultra

2858.559 --> 2863.4100000000003
conservative

2860.18 --> 2863.41
[Music]

2865.599 --> 2871.04
ultra conservative yeah with gays that's

2868.48 --> 2874.16
right of loss i like some of his

2871.04 --> 2877.359
policies i like how like yeah

2874.16 --> 2879.2799999999997
no [ __ ] rainbow flags no teaching

2877.359 --> 2881.44
children about sex

2879.28 --> 2885.2000000000003
and being gay yeah

2881.44 --> 2888.96
that's right i really like that i like

2885.2 --> 2888.96
how a lot of things have developed

2889.28 --> 2893.3590000000004
right

2890.72 --> 2895.359
i just happen to know

2893.359 --> 2898.0789999999997
that they

2895.359 --> 2900.4
like don't like cannabis

2898.079 --> 2903.2000000000003
at all

2900.4 --> 2906.0
and maybe it's like not really all that

2903.2 --> 2907.839
great for the russians or russian people

2906.0 --> 2909.119
on average i don't know that like they

2907.839 --> 2910.72
might have like

2909.119 --> 2911.92
a response to it because of their

2910.72 --> 2914.0789999999997
genetics

2911.92 --> 2916.559
where it isn't really all that optimal i

2914.079 --> 2919.6800000000003
don't know i don't know like russians

2916.559 --> 2921.8390000000004
that smoke cannabis i don't know i don't

2919.68 --> 2924.0
really know all that many russians in

2921.839 --> 2928.359
general except for what i sometimes get

2924.0 --> 2928.359
to see from videos or so

2930.0 --> 2934.88
right

2931.04 --> 2937.92
i just know that i'm a smoker so

2934.88 --> 2938.8
it's not viable for me to go and live

2937.92 --> 2941.52
there

2938.8 --> 2945.76
i don't really want to what i would want

2941.52 --> 2949.04
however is that the country i'm born in

2945.76 --> 2952.96
becomes sensible again

2949.04 --> 2956.5589999999997
digging into its original roots

2952.96 --> 2959.839
right the real dutch roots really wakes

2956.559 --> 2961.0400000000004
up and gets becomes an actual nation

2959.839 --> 2963.7599999999998
again

2961.04 --> 2967.359
that's what i want i don't want to go to

2963.76 --> 2970.3190000000004
russia so everything else can go to hell

2967.359 --> 2973.04
i want this place to become better i

2970.319 --> 2977.599
want the [ __ ] demon pieces of [ __ ]

2973.04 --> 2979.92
that are here to be taken care of

2977.599 --> 2981.119
that's what i want i don't want to move

2979.92 --> 2982.96
away

2981.119 --> 2984.96
gotta go away

2982.96 --> 2987.52
like a gamma

2984.96 --> 2988.48
yeah i want this place to change for the

2987.52 --> 2992.16
better

2988.48 --> 2994.72
and if it won't if it will end up like

2992.16 --> 2996.72
total maniacal ashay dove with your

2994.72 --> 2999.5989999999997
freaks and everybody's gay and there's a

2996.72 --> 3002.64
gay police like are you not gay enough

2999.599 --> 3004.48
you have to talk with patriarch or

3002.64 --> 3006.0
something or you're arrested yeah if

3004.48 --> 3009.599
that's gonna happen yeah then i will

3006.0 --> 3009.599
[ __ ] flee the country okay

3009.92 --> 3015.2000000000003
but as long as that doesn't happen it

3012.319 --> 3017.2799999999997
doesn't get much worse then i still

3015.2 --> 3020.0
hold on to a hope that this country

3017.28 --> 3021.8390000000004
could kind of be combination again like

3020.0 --> 3024.24
it used to be

3021.839 --> 3026.7999999999997
with a national spirit

3024.24 --> 3029.839
that people want scarf at that people

3026.8 --> 3031.2000000000003
will take hold off and use it again

3029.839 --> 3033.44
wield it again

3031.2 --> 3036.319
remember

3033.44 --> 3040.2400000000002
take the memories of our ancestors that

3036.319 --> 3042.319
were also doing that take back the power

3040.24 --> 3044.3999999999996
of the spirit that's what i want the

3042.319 --> 3046.079
netherlands that's what i want in the

3044.4 --> 3048.7200000000003
netherlands that's what i want everybody

3046.079 --> 3050.88
i don't want to move to russia just

3048.72 --> 3053.359
because they happen to be

3050.88 --> 3055.44
kicking ass and

3053.359 --> 3058.72
like running out of bubble gum

3055.44 --> 3058.7200000000003
right doing it right

3064.72 --> 3071.52
right and if you're in england and you

3067.2 --> 3073.839
feel the same way about your england

3071.52 --> 3076.319
then you shouldn't actually be wanting

3073.839 --> 3077.119
to move away to russia then you would be

3076.319 --> 3078.4
like

3077.119 --> 3081.839
i want

3078.4 --> 3085.52

3198.559 --> 3202.3190000000004
rule

3202.319 --> 3207.44
you have weird

3204.48 --> 3210.88
sexual preferences or whatever

3207.44 --> 3214.88
keep it to your [ __ ] selves

3210.88 --> 3214.88
that's how they do it yeah

3215.2 --> 3220.359
and condoning marijuana use i don't want

3218.4 --> 3223.6800000000003
to live in a place where there's like

3220.359 --> 3226.24
advertisement for marijuana brands

3223.68 --> 3228.0789999999997
on every bus stop right that's i don't

3226.24 --> 3232.319
want that

3228.079 --> 3234.8
i just want it to be available

3232.319 --> 3238.079
at a decent price

3234.8 --> 3239.6800000000003
with quality control

3238.079 --> 3242.7200000000003
and

3239.68 --> 3245.2799999999997
yeah and some tolerance for just

3242.72 --> 3247.359
people doing that and not misbehaving

3245.28 --> 3249.8390000000004
like i don't want people to just be

3247.359 --> 3251.68
stoned all the time in the streets i

3249.839 --> 3252.64
don't like that

3251.68 --> 3253.52
right

3252.64 --> 3256.0
i want

3253.52 --> 3258.24
people to gather in like do it in coffee

3256.0 --> 3263.04
shops or coffee houses like what they do

3258.24 --> 3264.3999999999996
in spain or do it in your own bag garden

3263.04 --> 3267.119
and make sure

3264.4 --> 3268.4
that when you do it you don't bother

3267.119 --> 3272.4
anyone

3268.4 --> 3275.28
yeah that's how i

3272.4 --> 3277.119
want a cannabis policy to be in in a

3275.28 --> 3278.799
country in my country and in other

3277.119 --> 3280.7200000000003
countries and this country has come

3278.799 --> 3282.88
pretty close to that

3280.72 --> 3285.4399999999996
despite it not even being officially

3282.88 --> 3287.28
legal do you even know do you even know

3285.44 --> 3290.559
in the netherlands it's technically not

3287.28 --> 3293.599
legal it still isn't after 20 years or

3290.559 --> 3295.8390000000004
more it's not legal yeah it's legal in

3293.599 --> 3298.7200000000003
some states in the united states it's

3295.839 --> 3302.96
not legal here it's just there's a

3298.72 --> 3302.9599999999996
condolence or a condoning

3304.319 --> 3309.52
it's like a tolerance policy

3306.72 --> 3312.64
that's very precise and it is kind of

3309.52 --> 3315.2
effective you can make your own plans

3312.64 --> 3316.8799999999997
legally you can have like five plants or

3315.2 --> 3318.3999999999996
something as long as it doesn't bother

3316.88 --> 3320.4
anybody

3318.4 --> 3323.44
and there's coffee shops

3320.4 --> 3325.76
and there's like controls for that

3323.44 --> 3328.16
and quality control right it's it's okay

3325.76 --> 3329.28
it's doable

3328.16 --> 3331.2
there's no

3329.28 --> 3334.1600000000003
creepy

3331.2 --> 3336.48
breeding of psychos and drug addicts

3334.16 --> 3339.7599999999998
that's coming out of it

3336.48 --> 3339.76
right that's the difference

3340.4 --> 3345.04
now i'd like to combine that

3344.079 --> 3348.799
with

3345.04 --> 3351.119
russia's gay policy

3348.799 --> 3353.44
so it so that it basically

3351.119 --> 3355.359
sort of becomes the same thing it's like

3353.44 --> 3356.88
make sure it doesn't bother anybody with

3355.359 --> 3359.2
you gay

3356.88 --> 3361.52
and yeah if you want to be gay like yeah

3359.2 --> 3363.4399999999996
you can't really make somebody not gay

3361.52 --> 3365.92
if they choose to if they can't let it

3363.44 --> 3368.4
go it's like just

3365.92 --> 3370.96
it's so much hassle it just

3368.4 --> 3372.88
like yeah it'll it will just get like

3370.96 --> 3376.4
iran or

3372.88 --> 3378.7200000000003
saudi arabia or something right

3376.4 --> 3381.44
where it's just absolutely illegal like

3378.72 --> 3383.68
you literally can't do it even in secret

3381.44 --> 3383.68
right

3383.76 --> 3388.079
but that's not doable that's gonna bring

3386.24 --> 3389.839
a lot of grief but if they just if

3388.079 --> 3391.8390000000004
they're just held by rules when they

3389.839 --> 3393.7599999999998
have to keep it a secret

3391.839 --> 3395.92
keep it to themselves then it won't

3393.76 --> 3397.92
bother anybody and that not everybody's

3395.92 --> 3399.6800000000003
going to grow up like oh my god

3397.92 --> 3402.079
everybody's gay

3399.68 --> 3404.319
i mean some of them might be gay but

3402.079 --> 3406.0
they keep it to themselves so that you

3404.319 --> 3407.359
don't have to be faced with it

3406.0 --> 3410.48
constantly

3407.359 --> 3412.72
yeah that's sensible the same goes for

3410.48 --> 3416.2400000000002
marijuana even though it's not in my

3412.72 --> 3419.359
opinion a sin like that people can

3416.24 --> 3421.68
be misbehaving when they use it if they

3419.359 --> 3423.2
don't pay attention

3421.68 --> 3424.64
like you can be misbehaving with

3423.2 --> 3428.3999999999996
anything you can be misbehaving with

3424.64 --> 3430.4
alcohol you can be misbehaving with

3428.4 --> 3432.48
music

3430.4 --> 3435.04
like [ __ ] that always put on the

3432.48 --> 3437.28
music way too loud and they do it every

3435.04 --> 3439.92
freaking weekend or something right and

3437.28 --> 3441.8390000000004
he always put it onto luck like that's

3439.92 --> 3444.319
[ __ ] annoying that doesn't mean oh

3441.839 --> 3448.0
battle music no it just means there has

3444.319 --> 3451.44
to be proper rules to deal with it

3448.0 --> 3453.92
so that you don't bother anybody

3451.44 --> 3456.92
that simple

3453.92 --> 3456.92
right

3473.28 --> 3477.92
the most dangerous thing about marijuana

3475.359 --> 3482.16
is getting caught with it

3477.92 --> 3482.16
well i never had that problem kevlar

3483.44 --> 3489.2000000000003
like i don't like that idea even like

3486.559 --> 3492.96
if i'm like i went to germany a couple

3489.2 --> 3494.0
of times to wave gothic traffic

3492.96 --> 3497.44
and

3494.0 --> 3498.72
i didn't bring marijuana

3497.44 --> 3501.359
even though

3498.72 --> 3503.7599999999998
like i could have

3501.359 --> 3506.48
although i think i just wasn't really

3503.76 --> 3509.76
smoking at that time

3506.48 --> 3511.76
but then when i was there one time even

3509.76 --> 3514.1600000000003
when i was with my ex somebody did

3511.76 --> 3515.6800000000003
actually bring some

3514.16 --> 3517.5989999999997
they smuggled it i didn't even know

3515.68 --> 3521.9199999999996
about that and then we did have some

3517.599 --> 3521.92
like a joint in germany also a leader

3523.44 --> 3528.0
but

3525.04 --> 3530.48
i don't like to do that illegally i'd

3528.0 --> 3533.2
like i'm not gonna be like i'm gonna be

3530.48 --> 3535.839
smoking marijuana no matter what i'm a

3533.2 --> 3538.72
badass oh it's illegal i'm gonna do it

3535.839 --> 3539.92
anyway no i i don't want i don't like

3538.72 --> 3542.24
that

3539.92 --> 3545.119
i want to be able to

3542.24 --> 3548.0
not think about that sort of [ __ ] and

3545.119 --> 3550.799
just be able to enjoy and

3548.0 --> 3553.2
and like let my mind just

3550.799 --> 3555.839
do its thing without having some

3553.2 --> 3559.1189999999997
backdrop fear of oh wait it's illegal

3555.839 --> 3562.4
what i'm doing i don't like that

3559.119 --> 3563.839
i never liked that right because

3562.4 --> 3567.2000000000003
i'm sensitive

3563.839 --> 3570.0
cannabis makes me even more sensitive if

3567.2 --> 3572.0
then like some kind of a fear sneaks up

3570.0 --> 3575.04
like oh it's illegal or i could get into

3572.0 --> 3579.68
real trouble that's a nightmare

3575.04 --> 3579.68
it makes it very not enjoyable to me

3582.72 --> 3587.1189999999997
sex in public toilets should be illegal

3584.88 --> 3591.04
too well i think it is

3587.119 --> 3593.2000000000003
borders boy i think it is illegal

3591.04 --> 3594.5589999999997
or maybe it's not illegal in california

3593.2 --> 3597.839
or something but

3594.559 --> 3597.8390000000004
it's illegal here

3598.24 --> 3604.5589999999997
i mean nobody's really gonna like oh i'm

3601.52 --> 3607.7599999999998
gonna call the police right now right

3604.559 --> 3610.48
but technically they could because it is

3607.76 --> 3613.48
illegal you're not allowed to do that

3610.48 --> 3613.48
right

3616.0 --> 3618.88
so yeah

3617.44 --> 3621.44
you're telling oh it should be illegal

3618.88 --> 3624.4
well it is illegal did you even realize

3621.44 --> 3624.4
that it is illegal

3624.88 --> 3630.799
did you see my message at 15 hello by

3676.559 --> 3681.599
you got the video from the yugoslavia

email seeking star wars also has my

3693.119 --> 3699.76
address i'm still waiting for

3696.319 --> 3701.839
the tarot deck to arrive

3699.76 --> 3704.4
i hope she already sent it

3701.839 --> 3708.319
might take a while like the us to the

3704.4 --> 3708.319
netherlands usually takes a while

3709.839 --> 3713.92
right

3711.359 --> 3715.359
also i've been thinking that

3713.92 --> 3717.599
i don't know how it works in the

3715.359 --> 3720.4
netherlands but it might be like an idea

3717.599 --> 3722.4
for me to get a p.o box

3720.4 --> 3725.359
like especially if i'm

3722.4 --> 3728.079
like going to be expecting to like get

3725.359 --> 3728.0789999999997
more mail

3729.839 --> 3735.119
and it might be a lot easier for people

3731.839 --> 3735.119
wanting to send me stuff

3735.359 --> 3740.2799999999997
right anyway looking forward to it

3741.359 --> 3744.4
yeah tony's in the uk is means eight

3743.039 --> 3747.4
minutes yeah i figured that out all

3744.4 --> 3747.4
flaws

3754.559 --> 3758.3190000000004
youtube censoring me

3757.52 --> 3760.88
what

3758.319 --> 3763.2799999999997
how's youtube censoring you did you use

3760.88 --> 3765.92
a word that i got banned

3763.28 --> 3767.92
i got a couple of words banned right

3765.92 --> 3771.44
because i never want anybody to ever

3767.92 --> 3772.88
address such things in my chat

3771.44 --> 3775.039
i'm not even going to tell you what it

3772.88 --> 3775.039
is

3776.0 --> 3781.079
you probably know if you paid attention

3801.92 --> 3804.0
right

3802.25 --> 3806.0
[Music]

3804.0 --> 3807.359
it's it's an interesting idea of flatter

3806.0 --> 3808.839
sage

3807.359 --> 3811.68
right but

3808.839 --> 3813.839
maybe uh it's just this is kind of

3811.68 --> 3815.68
creepy though to entertain this sort of

3813.839 --> 3818.16
thing but maybe there could be like a

3815.68 --> 3822.0789999999997
serious reformation in even like the

3818.16 --> 3825.839
entire approach of like drug use

3822.079 --> 3828.0
that maybe drug root use can be fully

3825.839 --> 3830.5589999999997
legalized

3828.0 --> 3833.2
but based on very specific conditions

3830.559 --> 3835.8390000000004
and that is that you never

3833.2 --> 3838.3999999999996
cause trouble because of it and that the

3835.839 --> 3840.5589999999997
type of trouble you cause as a direct

3838.4 --> 3842.079
provable result of it

3840.559 --> 3846.0
will then

3842.079 --> 3848.079
even out it will like be like a a gauge

3846.0 --> 3850.319
to give you a size up of how much you

3848.079 --> 3852.559
can handle it and if it just turns out

3850.319 --> 3854.799
that a certain drug

3852.559 --> 3858.1600000000003
every time you do bad [ __ ] then it

3854.799 --> 3860.4
specifically becomes illegal for you

3858.16 --> 3862.64
that drug

3860.4 --> 3864.48
like you're not allowed to take that

3862.64 --> 3865.52
because of these and these in these

3864.48 --> 3867.2
moments

3865.52 --> 3869.7599999999998
in the past

3867.2 --> 3872.64
where you proved that you absolutely

3869.76 --> 3872.6400000000003
cannot handle it

3874.0 --> 3876.319
right

3874.88 --> 3878.0
and that means like you're not

3876.319 --> 3879.119
responsible

3878.0 --> 3881.119
enough to

3879.119 --> 3884.799
to deal with that substance so it is

3881.119 --> 3884.799
specifically illegal for you

3886.079 --> 3890.4
it's an idea

3887.44 --> 3893.359
however it could be very tricky it could

3890.4 --> 3896.799
probably be exploitable

3893.359 --> 3896.799
by evil as well

3897.28 --> 3902.799
by basically saying like oh if you use

3900.079 --> 3903.8390000000004
these drugs and you get all inspired to

3902.799 --> 3908.24
be

3903.839 --> 3910.88
counter active in political opinions and

3908.24 --> 3913.9199999999996
then oh yeah the opinion those opinions

3910.88 --> 3916.96
expressing those opinions are

3913.92 --> 3918.799
damaging people are hurting the feelings

3916.96 --> 3920.799
so that means you cause damage so that

3918.799 --> 3923.68
means if you use that drug and you do

3920.799 --> 3925.52
that every time now it's illegal for you

3923.68 --> 3927.839
to have that drug that's the problem

3925.52 --> 3930.64
that could also roll out of it if the

3927.839 --> 3933.52
system that is in control of the rules

3930.64 --> 3936.7599999999998
is corrupted and political

3933.52 --> 3936.7599999999998
and all that

3940.88 --> 3945.52
right don't legalize heroin

3944.0 --> 3946.64
well

3945.52 --> 3947.44
i agree

3946.64 --> 3951.839
but

3947.44 --> 3951.839
decriminalize it though it's like

3953.68 --> 3959.2799999999997
people that push it onto people that

3955.92 --> 3962.319
have never used that before should be

3959.28 --> 3963.6800000000003
really badly punished

3962.319 --> 3966.16
like that's

3963.68 --> 3969.7599999999998
a serious criminal offense

3966.16 --> 3972.16
like somebody's never used heroin

3969.76 --> 3974.3190000000004
and you kind of push it on them like

3972.16 --> 3975.7599999999998
they feel really bad about something and

3974.319 --> 3978.079
you're like oh

3975.76 --> 3981.039
dude try it out it's a real distraction

3978.079 --> 3984.4
that's the moment where you literally

3981.039 --> 3986.7990000000004
kill them in ways metaphorically that

3984.4 --> 3990.079
should be brutally illegal and

3986.799 --> 3993.92
punishable somebody does that

3990.079 --> 3995.92
right but if somebody is already

3993.92 --> 3998.7200000000003
addicted to it

3995.92 --> 4000.2400000000002
do you really want to make every step of

3998.72 --> 4003.2
their life a hell because they're

4000.24 --> 4005.2799999999997
engaging in that illegal thing

4003.2 --> 4007.0389999999998
or you want to kind of just make sure

4005.28 --> 4009.92
that they don't

4007.039 --> 4012.92
get in people's way too much

4009.92 --> 4012.92
right

4041.44 --> 4044.48
okay that might have been too rash mr

4043.599 --> 4046.1600000000003
sam

4044.48 --> 4048.2400000000002
yeah oh is the first time you're

4046.16 --> 4050.799
watching well that's not your cue to

4048.24 --> 4052.5589999999997
start blabbering

4050.799 --> 4055.599
the first time you're watching why don't

4052.559 --> 4058.559
you watch the show first

4055.599 --> 4058.559
see what i'm about

4058.799 --> 4062.52
if you're just a troll

4062.799 --> 4068.64
try to roll in sneaky remarks

4065.599 --> 4070.319
be backstabbing gamma then i will catch

4068.64 --> 4072.5589999999997
on to it and i will ban you and it might

4070.319 --> 4074.4
be a little preemptive at first and when

4072.559 --> 4077.8390000000004
i notice that i'm preemptive then i will

4074.4 --> 4077.839
unban you give you another chance

4080.0 --> 4084.0
i watch you on nathan's channel okay

4081.76 --> 4084.7990000000004
cool mr sam

4084.0 --> 4086.96
well

4084.799 --> 4088.28
yeah this is flat earth early bird

4086.96 --> 4093.88
episode

4088.28 --> 4093.88
1231 so i've been around for a while

4107.759 --> 4112.799
give people an excuse to try it

4111.199 --> 4115.04
it might what

4112.799 --> 4118.839
what do you mean it might give people an

4115.04 --> 4118.839
excuse to try it

4133.279 --> 4140.080000000001
the issue is is that people shouldn't be

4136.08 --> 4142.88
wanting to try it in the first place

4140.08 --> 4144.4
hard drugs that is like heroin like

4142.88 --> 4148.2390000000005
they should be

4144.4 --> 4150.4
very wary of it like weary like

4148.239 --> 4150.4
no

4150.64 --> 4155.96
like never consider trying that ever

4163.839 --> 4168.64
you know that there is a difference

4165.359 --> 4171.04
between decriminalization and legal

4168.64 --> 4172.88
i don't know if flatter sage knows i

4171.04 --> 4174.56
know it

4172.88 --> 4177.4400000000005
legal means

4174.56 --> 4178.799
it can be

4177.44 --> 4182.0
used

4178.799 --> 4184.4
legal basically means normalized

4182.0 --> 4185.759
that means that corporations can start

4184.4 --> 4188.3189999999995
using it

4185.759 --> 4190.48
in advertisement and other things right

4188.319 --> 4192.080000000001
that's legal

4190.48 --> 4193.2789999999995
decriminalized

4192.08 --> 4196.0
means

4193.279 --> 4199.92
that it's not legal for advertising and

4196.0 --> 4201.28
normalization but that people that are

4199.92 --> 4204.96
doing that

4201.28 --> 4206.639999999999
are not like immediate like treated like

4204.96 --> 4209.679
like

4206.64 --> 4212.84
belligerent criminals necessarily that's

4209.679 --> 4212.84
the difference

4220.32 --> 4225.92
like they're just treated like

4222.8 --> 4227.6
sort of like uh

4225.92 --> 4229.36
mentally handicapped people people that

4227.6 --> 4232.2390000000005
have lost control that

4229.36 --> 4234.96
that potentially could get it back but

4232.239 --> 4237.44
they're just they're off

4234.96 --> 4239.679
don't make it even worse for them but

4237.44 --> 4242.639999999999
make sure that they don't

4239.679 --> 4244.36
bother other people with it right that's

4242.64 --> 4246.56
really like the objective of

4244.36 --> 4249.5599999999995
decriminalization and it's a good

4246.56 --> 4249.56
objective

4276.239 --> 4280.799999999999
illegal to position well it's

4278.719 --> 4282.719
drug possession personal use right but

4280.8 --> 4285.04
that those are like

4282.719 --> 4287.28
does have numerical values to them like

4285.04 --> 4289.12
in the netherlands that's five grams you

4287.28 --> 4291.599999999999
can't have more than five grams of

4289.12 --> 4293.679
cannabis or hashes or

4291.6 --> 4295.679
right

4293.679 --> 4298.0
if you have more then you have to have

4295.679 --> 4300.719
special exemption for that because

4298.0 --> 4303.92
you're a coffee shop dealer they get

4300.719 --> 4307.36
inspection they get rules

4303.92 --> 4308.4
right but a common guy can't just walk

4307.36 --> 4311.04
around

4308.4 --> 4311.92
with a giant bag a weed

4311.04 --> 4315.84
right

4311.92 --> 4315.84
that's how it works

4316.08 --> 4321.679
because if you fully legalize then

4319.12 --> 4324.239
people can literally like be like oh

4321.679 --> 4327.04
look at my bags of weed look at my bags

4324.239 --> 4329.199
of weed and just like go crazy with it

4327.04 --> 4333.12
and it's legal right and then other

4329.199 --> 4336.639999999999
people are going to get crazy ideas too

4333.12 --> 4336.64
that's full legalization

4337.12 --> 4341.04
that

4338.08 --> 4343.84
is not recommended

4341.04 --> 4343.84
by me

4360.0 --> 4364.56
right by the way

4362.4 --> 4368.799999999999
everything that i said should be applied

4364.56 --> 4368.8
to pharmacological drugs as well

4369.28 --> 4374.8
like you shouldn't be walking around

4371.36 --> 4377.36
with like giant bags of

4374.8 --> 4380.320000000001
adderall or whatever the [ __ ] all those

4377.36 --> 4381.28
names even i don't know them i've never

4380.32 --> 4384.639999999999
ever

4381.28 --> 4387.5199999999995
ever tried anything other than like

4384.64 --> 4390.159000000001
aspirin paracetamol

4387.52 --> 4392.64
and ibuprofen i've never

4390.159 --> 4395.679
ever tried anything other than that i

4392.64 --> 4398.56
might have tried like a xanax once

4395.679 --> 4402.88
when i was like 17 and then like really

4398.56 --> 4402.88
serious crazy panic that wouldn't stop

4403.92 --> 4409.679
like it just wouldn't stop and i was

4405.52 --> 4409.679
like help me sedate me ah

4410.08 --> 4414.96
i don't even know if it helped it's like

4411.92 --> 4417.92
the only time i even tried that

4414.96 --> 4421.6
right i never try any of it well they

4417.92 --> 4423.76
should be treated like drugs

4421.6 --> 4427.84
and they will be used

4423.76 --> 4427.84
like people use drugs

4428.4 --> 4433.04
right why do you use drugs why use this

4430.56 --> 4435.04
why do you do that to get through

4433.04 --> 4437.84
to give you that special moment to give

4435.04 --> 4440.48
you that special edge

4437.84 --> 4443.76
it's the same it's just the same so it

4440.48 --> 4448.0
should be treated the same right

4443.76 --> 4450.08
if somebody has like adderall addiction

4448.0 --> 4453.28
how is that like and they still go to

4450.08 --> 4455.44
work and they have like

4453.28 --> 4457.84
they're not really communicable

4455.44 --> 4459.199
they're good they're like not very

4457.84 --> 4461.6
sociable

4459.199 --> 4464.4
well how is that different from a guy

4461.6 --> 4467.280000000001
that is like a stoner man and you just

4464.4 --> 4468.799999999999
can't stop smoking cannabis all the time

4467.28 --> 4472.48
including in the bricks and he does it

4468.8 --> 4472.4800000000005
secret how is that different

4473.44 --> 4477.44
i don't see how that's different if i

4475.28 --> 4479.36
mean if the guy is just hanging around

4477.44 --> 4481.04
not doing anything that's just lame

4479.36 --> 4484.639999999999
right

4481.04 --> 4486.88
but then it's because he's not working

4484.64 --> 4488.8
but if he managed to actually do

4486.88 --> 4491.4400000000005
something with if he like really gets

4488.8 --> 4493.52
into a creative flow and he produces

4491.44 --> 4496.4
inspiring things because of the cannabis

4493.52 --> 4498.719
use then what's the problem

4496.4 --> 4498.719
right

4500.64 --> 4504.719
it's all about productivity

4503.36 --> 4506.5599999999995
and balance

4504.719 --> 4510.88
are you gonna grow out of control

4506.56 --> 4513.52
because of the substance that you use

4510.88 --> 4517.1990000000005
when you use it to make to yield

4513.52 --> 4519.120000000001
something to yield some productivity

4517.199 --> 4522.639999999999
are you gonna be able to balance it out

4519.12 --> 4525.64
or is it gonna wear on you over time

4522.64 --> 4525.64
anyway

4541.44 --> 4548.5599999999995
yeah

4542.88 --> 4548.56
a parking ticket 100 dollar fine okay

4550.96 --> 4556.52
that could be worse at least you're not

4552.56 --> 4556.52
put in jail or something

4584.239 --> 4587.44
yeah tony whitcomb

4590.0 --> 4593.84
every time i hear that this just makes

4592.08 --> 4596.8
my heart drop

4593.84 --> 4596.8
like [ __ ]

4600.96 --> 4605.92
and then the issue like malpractice is

4603.36 --> 4606.96
isn't necessarily even like on purpose

4605.92 --> 4608.4
you see

4606.96 --> 4610.4
it's just like

4608.4 --> 4614.4
mistakes

4610.4 --> 4616.4
or like a cataclysm of mistakes

4614.4 --> 4618.719
and that yeah that actually does get

4616.4 --> 4620.08
people killed more than

4618.719 --> 4624.159
that is

4620.08 --> 4624.159
yeah then people would willingly admit

4624.4 --> 4628.199
especially doctors

4650.88 --> 4654.4800000000005
there's some horrendous addictive big

4652.8 --> 4658.64
pharma

4654.48 --> 4661.199
fiji okay pgc net well

4658.64 --> 4663.84
good idea not to try that then

4661.199 --> 4666.0
right any type of like visceral

4663.84 --> 4669.4400000000005
suppression drug is always going to be

4666.0 --> 4671.76
bad noon why are you feeling terrible

4669.44 --> 4675.759999999999
it's a lesson it's called

4671.76 --> 4677.6
going through a lesson you feel terrible

4675.76 --> 4680.2390000000005
there's gonna be a reason you feel

4677.6 --> 4682.4800000000005
terrible you might not have as much grip

4680.239 --> 4685.36
on what that reason is with your

4682.48 --> 4688.5599999999995
faculties because you've been avoiding

4685.36 --> 4689.839999999999
it for too long or you literally burn it

4688.56 --> 4691.4400000000005
out of your

4689.84 --> 4693.76
consciousness because you didn't want to

4691.44 --> 4695.599999999999
deal with it and then you might be lost

4693.76 --> 4697.280000000001
and you just feel the punishment but if

4695.6 --> 4698.64
you also then walk away from that

4697.28 --> 4700.5599999999995
punishment

4698.64 --> 4702.719
guess what's going to happen it's just

4700.56 --> 4705.6
going to get worse when it returns

4702.719 --> 4708.4
because it will return until you learned

4705.6 --> 4708.400000000001
your lesson

4712.159 --> 4718.48
you can't erase that

4715.92 --> 4720.719
you just can't

4718.48 --> 4724.4
you can't prevent

4720.719 --> 4727.36
the punishment side of life from getting

4724.4 --> 4729.839999999999
through to you you can't stop that if

4727.36 --> 4732.0
you want to stop that

4729.84 --> 4734.56
then you might just as well find the

4732.0 --> 4737.28
quickest method to kill yourself because

4734.56 --> 4738.320000000001
that is exactly what life is all about

4737.28 --> 4742.159
about

4738.32 --> 4745.759999999999
facing the pain when it gets there

4742.159 --> 4748.879999999999
and learning from it

4745.76 --> 4752.360000000001
not avoiding it like a stupid little

4748.88 --> 4752.36
[ __ ] coward

4757.06 --> 4760.249000000001
[Music]

4763.41 --> 4767.04
[Music]

4768.88 --> 4773.609
uh

4770.52 --> 4773.609
[Music]

4776.4 --> 4782.0
i mean if you if you want to be escapist

4779.679 --> 4784.719
so badly

4782.0 --> 4787.04
then do the ultimate escape trick right

4784.719 --> 4788.84
escape forever

4787.04 --> 4792.719
so one way escape

4788.84 --> 4794.88
route if if you don't want to live that

4792.719 --> 4797.52
badly if you don't want to deal with

4794.88 --> 4801.28
what is really there that badly then

4797.52 --> 4802.400000000001
what's what's holding you here you know

4801.28 --> 4804.48
face

4802.4 --> 4809.599999999999
[ __ ] reality

4804.48 --> 4812.638999999999
stop being a [ __ ] stop making your

4809.6 --> 4815.6
unwillingness to face reality everybody

4812.639 --> 4817.36
else's problem

4815.6 --> 4820.8
because that's what you're doing yeah

4817.36 --> 4824.719
when people don't face reality they make

4820.8 --> 4827.12
their problem other people's problem

4824.719 --> 4829.6
they literally take that weight that

4827.12 --> 4831.44
they don't want to take and they throw

4829.6 --> 4833.04
it at other people

4831.44 --> 4835.919999999999
that's what they do and it makes

4833.04 --> 4839.12
everything worse

4835.92 --> 4842.96
and there is no moral excuse for doing

4839.12 --> 4846.4
that it's just weak and pathetic and

4842.96 --> 4849.8
potentially evil if you really doubling

4846.4 --> 4849.799999999999
down on that

4872.88 --> 4878.08
yeah i kind of bear yeah there's some

4874.32 --> 4880.0
terrible stuff but fentanyl is is very

4878.08 --> 4882.719
dangerous

4880.0 --> 4887.32
like it is almost like a paralyzing drug

4882.719 --> 4887.32
it literally just paralyzes you

4888.639 --> 4893.04
like don't ever

4891.04 --> 4895.6
ever try that like

4893.04 --> 4897.6
that sort of drug for me is a reason why

4895.6 --> 4901.360000000001
i literally never

4897.6 --> 4904.88
would never take a drink from anybody

4901.36 --> 4907.44
that i did not pour myself from scratch

4904.88 --> 4909.04
it's like that stuff is so [ __ ]

4907.44 --> 4912.36
dangerous

4909.04 --> 4912.36
it's unreal

4933.199 --> 4939.36
wow well tony whitcomb

4935.6 --> 4941.360000000001
if that is that if that's a doctor

4939.36 --> 4944.36
if you can prove that that's a singular

4941.36 --> 4944.36
individual

4944.639 --> 4948.96
i'd start basically

4946.8 --> 4951.12
professing to people this is a fake

4948.96 --> 4954.96
doctor this is an imposter

4951.12 --> 4957.04
this is a a medical political infiltrate

4954.96 --> 4960.4
a eugenicist

4957.04 --> 4963.28
person that doesn't have interest

4960.4 --> 4964.159
in people's medical well-being is just

4963.28 --> 4966.719
there

4964.159 --> 4968.799999999999
to follow the [ __ ] program make a lot

4966.719 --> 4969.84
of money

4968.8 --> 4972.719
and do

4969.84 --> 4973.84
what the state the control system tells

4972.719 --> 4977.44
them to do

4973.84 --> 4977.4400000000005
they're not actually doctors then

4985.36 --> 4991.28
yeah a doctor does an analysis

4989.04 --> 4994.639
what's going on

4991.28 --> 4997.04
and then finds a dynamic way of dealing

4994.639 --> 4999.679
with that for the person tinker taylor

4997.04 --> 5002.719
to the person's ability range right they

4999.679 --> 5005.12
have to be able to maintain themselves

5002.719 --> 5007.199
understand what the [ __ ] going on

5005.12 --> 5009.199
in a balanced way not just panic about

5007.199 --> 5011.44
it try to forget about it they need to

5009.199 --> 5014.32
be able to deal with it

5011.44 --> 5016.4
being a doctor requires a very dynamic

5014.32 --> 5019.36
range

5016.4 --> 5022.799999999999
of dealing with people and knowing

5019.36 --> 5025.839999999999
actually about medical stuff

5022.8 --> 5025.84
so if they're just

5026.08 --> 5032.159
doing it like that then they're not

5027.84 --> 5034.96
effectively doctors they're charlatans

5032.159 --> 5036.48
yeah i was faced with a guy like that

5034.96 --> 5038.56
one time

5036.48 --> 5039.44
who literally cost me giants amount of

5038.56 --> 5040.400000000001
money

5039.44 --> 5044.0
and

5040.4 --> 5046.638999999999
did not help me with a single thing

5044.0 --> 5047.92
i eventually got back there faced him

5046.639 --> 5049.76
and told him

5047.92 --> 5051.04
you're

5049.76 --> 5053.76
like you're

5051.04 --> 5056.239
you're a charlatan i told it to his face

5053.76 --> 5058.400000000001
you're a charlatan

5056.239 --> 5060.08
you don't have people's medical interest

5058.4 --> 5062.96
at heart

5060.08 --> 5064.96
you seem to be more prioritizing

5062.96 --> 5067.44
sizing of people and putting them into

5064.96 --> 5070.88
boxes categorizing them instead of

5067.44 --> 5074.48
actually listening to what they need

5070.88 --> 5076.719
and help them with what they need

5074.48 --> 5082.48
guess what happened with the doctor

5076.719 --> 5082.4800000000005
yeah he retired like two months later

5082.719 --> 5088.0
that was my previous doctor

5086.0 --> 5090.8
yeah and that's real it's not me making

5088.0 --> 5092.88
that up he retired

5090.8 --> 5095.12
very shortly after

5092.88 --> 5097.76
after i faced him with that basically

5095.12 --> 5101.599999999999
told him you're a fascist

5097.76 --> 5101.6
you're like i told him you're a fascist

5102.48 --> 5106.959999999999
right not like an sjw because i was

5105.199 --> 5109.5199999999995
actually able to explain it like you

5106.96 --> 5112.719
don't have people's

5109.52 --> 5115.040000000001
health at heart you don't care you don't

5112.719 --> 5116.159
care about people actually doing their

5115.04 --> 5118.239
best

5116.159 --> 5120.32
because that's how you treated me i was

5118.239 --> 5123.12
in severe

5120.32 --> 5124.96
pain about things i explained everything

5123.12 --> 5126.8
about it even though i had barely

5124.96 --> 5128.639
control over my physique at points it

5126.8 --> 5130.639
was literally like lying on the floor

5128.639 --> 5132.88
drooling at some point because of the

5130.639 --> 5135.679
agony

5132.88 --> 5138.159000000001
and he just sent me somewhere else did

5135.679 --> 5140.56
not listen to a word i said did not give

5138.159 --> 5143.679
me anything that i asked for it's not

5140.56 --> 5146.159000000001
like oh give me her no i did not no i

5143.679 --> 5148.2390000000005
just said like i just need something to

5146.159 --> 5151.199
stop the sickness the feeling of

5148.239 --> 5154.32
sickness i just need something anything

5151.199 --> 5156.239
like a herb something that stops this

5154.32 --> 5157.679
this nausea please

5156.239 --> 5159.36
please

5157.679 --> 5163.1990000000005
we didn't

5159.36 --> 5164.5599999999995
do it the piece of [ __ ] doctor didn't do

5163.199 --> 5166.96
it

5164.56 --> 5170.639
when i got back and i told him you cost

5166.96 --> 5173.28
me [ __ ] 500 euros and i didn't even

5170.639 --> 5174.719
get anything from it you're a [ __ ]

5173.28 --> 5176.96
fascist

5174.719 --> 5178.96
you should be ashamed of yourself you're

5176.96 --> 5180.84
an embarrassment to the medical

5178.96 --> 5182.4
establishment you're an

5180.84 --> 5184.4800000000005
embarrassment

5182.4 --> 5185.759999999999
that was before covet by the way way

5184.48 --> 5188.159
before that

5185.76 --> 5188.159000000001
it's like

5189.76 --> 5194.96
uh

5191.0 --> 5197.52
2015 2016.

5194.96 --> 5199.76
well he resigned after that

5197.52 --> 5202.400000000001
retrospect was probably the best thing

5199.76 --> 5204.719
that happened to him

5202.4 --> 5208.0
because otherwise yeah what if he had to

5204.719 --> 5208.88
sit through the cope with [ __ ] right

5208.0 --> 5212.719
but

5208.88 --> 5216.8
yeah that happened to me

5212.719 --> 5217.52
i don't let doctors tell me [ __ ] yeah

5216.8 --> 5219.28
no

5217.52 --> 5223.76
i'm sorry doctor

5219.28 --> 5226.719
you're in my surface it's my body

5223.76 --> 5229.1990000000005
i have control over the decision making

5226.719 --> 5232.08
here you understand doctor

5229.199 --> 5234.879999999999
you don't you have your analytical

5232.08 --> 5236.48
abilities you have options that you can

5234.88 --> 5240.32
present

5236.48 --> 5243.678999999999
that i can ponder upon and consider

5240.32 --> 5248.639
you don't have any say over that and you

5243.679 --> 5251.52
especially don't have any room here

5248.639 --> 5255.52
to put in suggestions for your little

5251.52 --> 5255.52
medical plans you understand

5255.6 --> 5258.0
you're

5256.96 --> 5260.719
my

5258.0 --> 5264.32
worker you're my medical worker that's

5260.719 --> 5267.04
in my surface when i go to you

5264.32 --> 5270.159
and that's how i treat doctors and it

5267.04 --> 5273.44
works but you have to stay sharp

5270.159 --> 5275.92
if you surrender to a doctor and say

5273.44 --> 5279.199
doctor knows better dude you're going to

5275.92 --> 5282.32
be rolled into like this weird conveyor

5279.199 --> 5283.5199999999995
belt social engineering way of going

5282.32 --> 5286.0
about

5283.52 --> 5287.280000000001
that a lot of the time

5286.0 --> 5290.8
doesn't

5287.28 --> 5293.679
medically help you

5290.8 --> 5297.76
that's why you must

5293.679 --> 5298.8
you must every person in the world

5297.76 --> 5301.1990000000005
must

5298.8 --> 5304.0
to some degree within their ability

5301.199 --> 5307.678999999999
range take control

5304.0 --> 5310.159
and insight over their own medical

5307.679 --> 5312.4
working how do you work how does it work

5310.159 --> 5313.92
with your family how did it work with

5312.4 --> 5316.159
your parents how did it work with your

5313.92 --> 5318.56
grandparents what did they go through

5316.159 --> 5320.799999999999
what did they all learn from it

5318.56 --> 5322.4800000000005
talk with your family about medical

5320.8 --> 5325.04
conditions even the embarrassing one

5322.48 --> 5327.678999999999
talk about it learn about it learn more

5325.04 --> 5331.12
take medical responsibility have medical

5327.679 --> 5334.4
oversight you need to know

5331.12 --> 5336.4
what's going on and how that works and

5334.4 --> 5337.36
learn and keep learning the rest of your

5336.4 --> 5339.36
life

5337.36 --> 5342.96
to the best of your ability range you

5339.36 --> 5345.36
don't have to be a verbal master but you

5342.96 --> 5348.08
have to know

5345.36 --> 5350.4
because you have to take responsibility

5348.08 --> 5352.8
when you actually face

5350.4 --> 5355.4
the medical establishment when you face

5352.8 --> 5357.76
doctors you need to take that

5355.4 --> 5360.879999999999
responsibility and in order to take that

5357.76 --> 5364.0
responsibility you need to know

5360.88 --> 5366.719
you need to understand how you work how

5364.0 --> 5368.8
your body works how it responds to foods

5366.719 --> 5372.08
how it responds to rest how the response

5368.8 --> 5374.0
are not rest you need to know strategies

5372.08 --> 5377.28
in how to deal with medical problems you

5374.0 --> 5380.239
need to know all that and then you can

5377.28 --> 5383.04
properly face the doctor

5380.239 --> 5385.759999999999
to potentially threat slightly outside

5383.04 --> 5388.159
of your normal expertise

5385.76 --> 5390.88
if there isn't systemic issue

5388.159 --> 5394.239
that you can't really get a grasp on

5390.88 --> 5397.4400000000005
you always need to have that knowledge

5394.239 --> 5400.799999999999
take responsibility for yourself that

5397.44 --> 5403.678999999999
nobody's gonna tell you anything

5400.8 --> 5407.84
unless you accept it because you're the

5403.679 --> 5407.84
one responsible for your own health

5416.159 --> 5420.159
right

5416.96 --> 5424.159
and if you don't then just go and convey

5420.159 --> 5426.08
your belt until it leads to your death

5424.159 --> 5428.799999999999
fine you don't want to know anything

5426.08 --> 5431.04

it's your choice

5434.4 --> 5438.719
you don't want to know about it

5436.32 --> 5440.96
that's going to cost you your life

5438.719 --> 5442.88
especially right now

5440.96 --> 5445.92
it was always going to cost your life

5442.88 --> 5449.400000000001

wars

5494.96 --> 5498.88
and yes i didn't see your message

5496.639 --> 5502.679
because it was too

5498.88 --> 5502.679
focused on my message

5504.239 --> 5508.759999999999
oh man

5505.36 --> 5508.759999999999
time is flying

5519.92 --> 5523.079
[Music]

5540.4 --> 5543.36
god damn it

5545.679 --> 5550.04
nathan's not doing a live show

5562.56 --> 5567.92
you went panic attacks statins what the

5565.679 --> 5567.92
[ __ ]

5568.4 --> 5572.0
that's

5569.44 --> 5573.04
like what the [ __ ] is wrong with that

5572.0 --> 5575.679
guy

5573.04 --> 5579.76
why the hell would you use statins in

5575.679 --> 5583.08
relation to panic attacks that's absurd

5579.76 --> 5583.08
like absurd

5600.08 --> 5604.8
that's like oh like oh man i'm

5603.679 --> 5607.1990000000005
i'm having

5604.8 --> 5609.84
concentration problems oh here take

5607.199 --> 5611.5199999999995
these blood thinners

5609.84 --> 5612.719
why

5611.52 --> 5617.2390000000005
why

5612.719 --> 5617.2390000000005
that makes no [ __ ] sense

5621.44 --> 5623.919999999999
like dude you should have well you

5623.04 --> 5626.239
should have

5623.92 --> 5628.2390000000005
you could have basically told them uh

5626.239 --> 5631.599999999999
i'm sorry

5628.239 --> 5634.239
is this how you practice medicine

5631.6 --> 5637.360000000001
i think i might be contacting like a

5634.239 --> 5638.5599999999995
medical board about that

5637.36 --> 5641.679
because

5638.56 --> 5643.84
this seems like terrible advice you just

5641.679 --> 5645.679
gave me and it seemed medically

5643.84 --> 5649.84
irresponsible

5645.679 --> 5649.84
for a doctor to just do that

5652.96 --> 5659.84
because you're over 50 ridiculous

5656.88 --> 5659.84
ridiculous

5661.52 --> 5667.1990000000005
that's that's just like oh just give you

5664.88 --> 5669.4400000000005
statins you're over 50. like that seems

5667.199 --> 5671.04
very eugenicist to me it's like oh

5669.44 --> 5673.678999999999
you're old so

5671.04 --> 5676.159
take the next step

5673.679 --> 5678.0
like hurry it up and die already that's

5676.159 --> 5680.799999999999
basically what that means oh you're over

5678.0 --> 5683.44
50 take this oh so you're telling me

5680.8 --> 5686.08
hurry up and die already

5683.44 --> 5688.5599999999995
go on that [ __ ] that really old people

5686.08 --> 5689.6
are on hurry it up so so i can get to

5688.56 --> 5691.360000000001
dying

5689.6 --> 5693.4400000000005
is is that what you're telling me to

5691.36 --> 5695.36
doctor

5693.44 --> 5697.759999999999
why didn't you go take him

5695.36 --> 5700.92
huh but you could take him tell me how

5697.76 --> 5700.92
it works

5704.239 --> 5709.5199999999995
lost all trust right

5706.639 --> 5711.6
well i would go beyond that really

5709.52 --> 5713.6
and i'd go back

5711.6 --> 5715.52
telling like you this is medical

5713.6 --> 5718.400000000001
malpractice

5715.52 --> 5720.4800000000005
this is horrific what you're doing if i

5718.4 --> 5723.44
if i hear from anybody

5720.48 --> 5725.199
telling me that you gave them terrible

5723.44 --> 5727.36
advice like that

5725.199 --> 5728.48
or that i hear of somebody that had that

5727.36 --> 5730.159
and actually

5728.48 --> 5732.718999999999
ended up like

5730.159 --> 5736.0
in a medical predicament because of it

5732.719 --> 5737.44
and i'll sue you

5736.0 --> 5739.44
right

5737.44 --> 5740.96
but then again i'm a

5739.44 --> 5743.119
bit more

5740.96 --> 5744.719
forward when it comes to those types of

5743.119 --> 5748.159
things

5744.719 --> 5749.6
like doctors that are like that should

5748.159 --> 5751.599999999999
not be

5749.6 --> 5754.0
practicing they should have their

5751.6 --> 5757.280000000001
license revoked

5754.0 --> 5759.84
like you're incompetent

5757.28 --> 5762.0
you're not actually doing your job

5759.84 --> 5763.76
you're not applying your faculties and

5762.0 --> 5766.639
your knowledge

5763.76 --> 5770.96
you're having an automated response

5766.639 --> 5773.1990000000005
and it will result in very irresponsible

5770.96 --> 5774.88
actions

5773.199 --> 5777.5199999999995
you're telling people to do things that

5774.88 --> 5779.4400000000005
doesn't actually help like that provably

5777.52 --> 5780.400000000001
doesn't help and if they don't know

5779.44 --> 5782.159
about it

5780.4 --> 5784.96
then they'll probably just do it because

5782.159 --> 5787.28
they don't know about it that's highly

5784.96 --> 5788.8
irresponsible

5787.28 --> 5790.88
of course you could say oh but it's

5788.8 --> 5793.84
their responsibility to know about oh

5790.88 --> 5795.119
really so the doctor is just there to to

5793.84 --> 5796.719
test you

5795.119 --> 5799.04
whether you actually know what the

5796.719 --> 5801.36
[ __ ] going on or not and if you don't

5799.04 --> 5804.719
then you just get rolled in some crazy

5801.36 --> 5805.599999999999
[ __ ] that could kill you or something

5804.719 --> 5808.159
like

5805.6 --> 5812.52
what kind of a doctor is that if that's

5808.159 --> 5812.5199999999995
allowed that that's preposterous

5817.119 --> 5821.839999999999
right if you're a doctor then you

5819.199 --> 5824.96
practice it and you do it right

5821.84 --> 5827.28
and if it doesn't work for some reason

5824.96 --> 5829.199
in that day even like oh i can't focus

5827.28 --> 5831.28
right and it happens to the best of us

5829.199 --> 5832.96
even the doctor they will have it

5831.28 --> 5834.32
because what you do

5832.96 --> 5835.76
you tell them

5834.32 --> 5838.4
uh yeah

5835.76 --> 5840.8
secretary i'm gonna take the day off i

5838.4 --> 5843.839999999999
can't focus today i'm gonna do something

5840.8 --> 5845.84
to try and like get my mind of this [ __ ]

5843.84 --> 5847.679
so i get back to normal right that's

5845.84 --> 5848.88
what you do then oh you're you're not

5847.679 --> 5850.0
fully

5848.88 --> 5851.679
focused

5850.0 --> 5855.84
you take the day off you can do that

5851.679 --> 5855.84
[ __ ] as a doctor right

5856.08 --> 5861.76
but to then like oh

5858.4 --> 5863.04
give inadequate advice

5861.76 --> 5866.6
that's

5863.04 --> 5866.6
that's a problem

5886.0 --> 5889.36
man

5887.04 --> 5892.36
i'm so disappointed there's no flatter

5889.36 --> 5892.36
debate

5896.8 --> 5902.400000000001
apparently nathan had been like

5900.239 --> 5903.599999999999
working on his daughter's

5902.4 --> 5906.159
bedroom

5903.6 --> 5908.4800000000005
all weekend

5906.159 --> 5911.839999999999
and he overworked himself so he said in

5908.48 --> 5911.839999999999
chat in the skype chat

5931.04 --> 5937.6
right well omega genesis in my opinion

5935.52 --> 5939.84
if they function like that and they just

5937.6 --> 5941.92
become pharma pushers and they don't

5939.84 --> 5944.719
really take their patients seriously or

5941.92 --> 5947.119
their discipline serious anymore

5944.719 --> 5948.4
then they should be relieved from their

5947.119 --> 5950.239
function

5948.4 --> 5952.799999999999
they should have their doctor's license

5950.239 --> 5954.4
revoked like you are being an inadequate

5952.8 --> 5955.6
doctor

5954.4 --> 5958.159
right

5955.6 --> 5960.400000000001
i mean 200 years ago

5958.159 --> 5963.599999999999
if doctors were caught

5960.4 --> 5967.04
being sloppy like that they would have

5963.6 --> 5968.320000000001
their medical license revoked

5967.04 --> 5970.0
200 years

5968.32 --> 5973.759999999999
maybe 200 years ago would be different

5970.0 --> 5976.4
but like a hundred years ago already

5973.76 --> 5979.1990000000005
was taken very serious like a doctor is

5976.4 --> 5981.839999999999
a high paid profession why because they

5979.199 --> 5985.28
have to be sharp they have to always be

5981.84 --> 5987.04
better than the average

5985.28 --> 5988.48
with what they do because it's so

5987.04 --> 5990.96
serious

5988.48 --> 5992.32
that's the requirement

5990.96 --> 5994.4800000000005
yeah

5992.32 --> 5997.119
that's not like oh that's the best way

5994.48 --> 6000.119
to be no that's the base

5997.119 --> 6000.119
requirements

6000.56 --> 6004.320000000001
the pay

6001.92 --> 6006.96
the paycheck

6004.32 --> 6010.5599999999995
is the reward for that

6006.96 --> 6012.639
for that for that base requirement if

6010.56 --> 6014.56
you don't do that you don't deserve that

6012.639 --> 6019.32
paycheck you don't deserve

6014.56 --> 6019.320000000001
being a doctor it's that simple

6027.63 --> 6030.8
[Music]

6033.04 --> 6037.199
if you just want the money

6035.199 --> 6040.4
then you chose the wrong profession you

6037.199 --> 6043.28
should have just become a salesman yeah

6040.4 --> 6044.5599999999995
and there's some really really high

6043.28 --> 6048.08
paying

6044.56 --> 6048.080000000001
salesman jobs out there

6048.8 --> 6055.92
where you you become sales

6051.84 --> 6057.6
and then you can get freaking rich

6055.92 --> 6060.32
yeah

6057.6 --> 6060.320000000001
potentially

6061.119 --> 6067.759999999999
but yeah a doctor is

6065.119 --> 6067.759999999999
the money

6068.32 --> 6072.4
should not be the highest priority

6072.48 --> 6078.5599999999995
your will to apply the skills and do it

6075.679 --> 6080.4800000000005
right should be the priority not the

6078.56 --> 6082.8
money

6080.48 --> 6084.32
the money is more like yeah you kind of

6082.8 --> 6086.08
need it

6084.32 --> 6087.679
to deal with all that [ __ ] because if

6086.08 --> 6089.44
you're a serious doctor if you take that

6087.679 --> 6093.84
series you're going to be facing with a

6089.44 --> 6093.839999999999
lot of personal heavy [ __ ]

6094.0 --> 6098.8
like people's darkest sides their

6096.4 --> 6100.96
biggest fears are gonna be shown to you

6098.8 --> 6102.56
you're gonna have to deal with that

6100.96 --> 6105.6
it's gonna be heavy on your shoulder

6102.56 --> 6108.719
sometimes right or having a bit of money

6105.6 --> 6110.96
being able to do a bit of luxury here

6108.719 --> 6112.4
and there to get all that [ __ ] off your

6110.96 --> 6115.44
mind

6112.4 --> 6118.4
is is only seems sensible

6115.44 --> 6121.5199999999995
if you don't take that responsibility if

6118.4 --> 6123.119
don't actually become a real doctor and

6121.52 --> 6125.040000000001
you're just doing it for the money then

6123.119 --> 6127.5199999999995
you don't deserve it

6125.04 --> 6129.84
that you don't deserve that money

6127.52 --> 6131.92
because you're not actually taking the

6129.84 --> 6134.8
punishment

6131.92 --> 6137.76
that comes with it and then you don't

6134.8 --> 6137.76
deserve that money

6140.48 --> 6143.599999999999
rocket scientists make loads of money

6142.48 --> 6145.678999999999
well yeah

6143.6 --> 6148.2390000000005
advertisement

6145.679 --> 6149.84
right for it's all social engineering

6148.239 --> 6151.44
advertising that's where the biggest

6149.84 --> 6154.159000000001
money is

6151.44 --> 6157.44
it's also where the biggest backstab

6154.159 --> 6157.44
situation will be

6159.119 --> 6162.4
but yeah

6160.719 --> 6164.639
doctor

6162.4 --> 6166.719
you know if you just want to be rich

6164.639 --> 6171.119
don't become a doctor that's not what

6166.719 --> 6173.52
it's about the money is is like the the

6171.119 --> 6176.5599999999995
it's the consolidation price of it it's

6173.52 --> 6178.719
you need that money to survive being a

6176.56 --> 6181.96
doctor if you're an actual doctor it's

6178.719 --> 6181.96
that simple

6192.719 --> 6195.719

i think he's an awesome guy by the way

6519.6 --> 6525.1990000000005
he's like one of my favorite actors

6522.48 --> 6527.36
this century for sure

6525.199 --> 6530.4

6527.36 --> 6530.4
what are you talking about

6539.04 --> 6542.4
that's because i'm making croissants

6541.199 --> 6543.44
popular but

6542.4 --> 6547.119
dude

6543.44 --> 6549.36

really it's almost like oh what do you

6575.04 --> 6579.84
mean hotcakes is that some kind of an ad

6577.199 --> 6582.159
scheme are you taking away the saying

6579.84 --> 6582.96
from croissants which is really what it

6582.159 --> 6586.159
is

6582.96 --> 6586.159
selling like hassan's

6589.679 --> 6594.96

6972.48 --> 6978.4
gammas constantly whining about ether

i don't want those people there

6978.4 --> 6982.679

earth oh yeah you'll be able to talk

6991.44 --> 6995.4
about flat earth absolutely

7011.28 --> 7017.44
playing video games isn't from yeah it

7014.56 --> 7020.96
is it is from away your time yeah

7017.44 --> 7024.4
because the games that we get to play

7020.96 --> 7025.36
aren't that stimulating

7024.4 --> 7027.04
yeah

7025.36 --> 7030.44
they aren't

7027.04 --> 7030.44
they suck

7030.88 --> 7037.4400000000005
video game industry has been infiltrated

7034.639 --> 7039.52
by social engineering industry which is

7037.44 --> 7042.239
tied into advertisement all they're

7039.52 --> 7046.719
trying to do is program everybody to

7042.239 --> 7047.839999999999
just buy their [ __ ] products and die

7046.719 --> 7050.56
yeah

7047.84 --> 7053.28
they're not stimulating they would have

7050.56 --> 7055.04
been stimulating they were stimulating

7053.28 --> 7056.32
yeah in the 90s

7055.04 --> 7058.4
when it was all just much more

7056.32 --> 7060.48
mechanical much more like direct

7058.4 --> 7062.96
everything you did you did immediately

7060.48 --> 7064.5599999999995
it's all life it's all real

7062.96 --> 7067.92
even though it was like

7064.56 --> 7070.400000000001
graphics wise little it wasn't that

7067.92 --> 7072.4
great looking you didn't need it

7070.4 --> 7076.32
because the game itself worked it was

7072.4 --> 7080.159
fluid it was interactive quickness

7076.32 --> 7082.719
and eye coordination reflexes yeah

7080.159 --> 7084.96
guess what games aren't like that

7082.719 --> 7087.52
anymore now

7084.96 --> 7089.119
yeah all those good things that were in

7087.52 --> 7092.2390000000005
there that were stimulating they could

7089.119 --> 7095.36
learn from it's not in there anymore

7092.239 --> 7097.28
it's just oh it's an interactive movie

7095.36 --> 7099.28
theater you're watching a movie but

7097.28 --> 7101.28
you're almost having the feeling like

7099.28 --> 7103.119
you're part of that movie

7101.28 --> 7105.36
but everything is so easy you don't have

7103.119 --> 7106.799999999999
to do anything oh don't worry it's not

7105.36 --> 7108.239
that hard all you have to do is just

7106.8 --> 7110.400000000001
push this button

7108.239 --> 7113.28
but that's the video game now yeah oh

7110.4 --> 7115.04
it's so stimulating oh you learn so much

7113.28 --> 7117.199
oh man you're getting these reflexes

7115.04 --> 7119.28
yeah no you're not

7117.199 --> 7122.08
it isn't like that anymore

7119.28 --> 7124.159
it's all crap now it's all just oh look

7122.08 --> 7126.48
at the graphics oh oh look at how

7124.159 --> 7129.5199999999995
virtuous sickeningly this is oh look at

7126.48 --> 7131.839999999999
how amazing inspiring and it references

7129.52 --> 7135.76
that yeah but you don't actually do

7131.84 --> 7135.76
anything interesting anymore though

7140.32 --> 7144.0
yeah

7141.599 --> 7147.04
it sucks now

7144.0 --> 7150.96
it's been infiltrated by eugenicists

7147.04 --> 7154.159
social engineers and advertisements

7150.96 --> 7157.76
and they're just there to ruin you and

7154.159 --> 7162.08
program you into consumer slaves that's

7157.76 --> 7164.4800000000005
what video game industry is now it sucks

7162.08 --> 7166.88
yeah it just sucks i mean some of the

7164.48 --> 7170.08
art is still interesting

7166.88 --> 7173.599
but as a concept as the the actual

7170.08 --> 7175.679
interactivity you know games

7173.599 --> 7177.92
yeah it sucks

7175.679 --> 7179.92
it's not good anymore

7177.92 --> 7182.4
it's just more like a slightly

7179.92 --> 7184.4
interactive movie now that's what it is

7182.4 --> 7187.04
it's not in a challenge it's not

7184.4 --> 7189.199
interesting it's not difficult anymore

7187.04 --> 7192.32
if it's difficult then it's it's like

7189.199 --> 7195.5199999999995
unreasonable there is no proper

7192.32 --> 7198.5599999999995
difficulty balance anymore

7195.52 --> 7200.8
it's all a slider between [ __ ] and

7198.56 --> 7202.88
impossible machine

7200.8 --> 7205.1990000000005
there is no proper

7202.88 --> 7207.84
curve anymore the balance is out of

7205.199 --> 7211.28
there why because the people that are

7207.84 --> 7213.84
building it don't care anymore

7211.28 --> 7213.84
that's why

7220.639 --> 7226.159000000001
because in the 90s

7222.88 --> 7229.04
video game programmers they cared oh my

7226.159 --> 7230.879999999999
god did they care it was the latest [ __ ]

7229.04 --> 7233.679
it was the hot thing it's like you're a

7230.88 --> 7235.52
video game programmer that's epic

7233.679 --> 7237.92
yeah

7235.52 --> 7240.320000000001
people cared about what they were making

7237.92 --> 7242.639
they wanted it to be good they wanted to

7240.32 --> 7245.119
be the experiencer of the game

7242.639 --> 7247.119
themselves and basically provide an

7245.119 --> 7249.199
experience that they wanted and they

7247.119 --> 7251.119
wanted to be on their own intelligence

7249.199 --> 7253.839999999999
level they would interface with the

7251.119 --> 7255.839999999999
program they would make they would do it

7253.84 --> 7257.360000000001
and they would usually do it themselves

7255.84 --> 7259.360000000001
now it's so industrial it's like all

7257.36 --> 7261.36
these hundreds of people and game tests

7259.36 --> 7264.639
nobody knows each other

7261.36 --> 7266.5599999999995
it's all prefab systemized there's no

7264.639 --> 7269.36
passion in it anymore

7266.56 --> 7271.84
it's all cookie cutter [ __ ] modulized

7269.36 --> 7273.36
automated there's no more direct

7271.84 --> 7276.0
connection

7273.36 --> 7280.5599999999995
it just sucks now it's all fully

7276.0 --> 7283.84
automated advertisement programming [ __ ]

7280.56 --> 7283.84
it sucks now

7286.05 --> 7289.209
[Music]

7290.719 --> 7295.199
you could say that disney turned

7293.679 --> 7297.92
a disney

7295.199 --> 7299.839999999999
that the gaming industry

7297.92 --> 7303.52
disney fight

7299.84 --> 7303.52
it turned from like a really

7303.679 --> 7311.04
inspired fresh out of the box

7307.28 --> 7314.08
new ground platform thing into just

7311.04 --> 7316.0
another monolithic empire out to destroy

7314.08 --> 7318.08
humanity that's what it is now that's

7316.0 --> 7320.88
what it's turning it's just another

7318.08 --> 7322.84
piece of the pyramid

7320.88 --> 7326.159000000001
social engineering

7322.84 --> 7328.88
eugenics advertisement

7326.159 --> 7330.96
that's what's ruling it now that's what

7328.88 --> 7332.719
that's what the the what is being

7330.96 --> 7334.0
conspired about that's what they are

7332.719 --> 7335.52
building that's what they're leaning

7334.0 --> 7338.56
upon that's what they're trying to use

7335.52 --> 7341.119000000001
to squeeze money out of their platform

7338.56 --> 7343.119000000001
now with the game industry

7341.119 --> 7345.04
the big corpse

7343.119 --> 7347.28
the big corporations

7345.04 --> 7350.8
that's what they do now

7347.28 --> 7353.36
yeah it's not about programmers like

7350.8 --> 7355.52
really making a game experience and

7353.36 --> 7359.199
making it like themselves

7355.52 --> 7361.679
fine they don't do that [ __ ] anymore

7359.199 --> 7363.36
they're not allowed to do it anymore and

7361.679 --> 7366.4800000000005
they don't want to do it anymore because

7363.36 --> 7368.199
they're so encapsulated in systematic

7366.48 --> 7369.919999999999
routines and [ __ ] and

7368.199 --> 7371.678999999999
compartmentalization there's no more

7369.92 --> 7374.32
passion there's no connection they don't

7371.679 --> 7377.92
want to do it anymore because being a

7374.32 --> 7379.04
game programmer now sucks

7377.92 --> 7381.84
really

7379.04 --> 7383.599
really sucks

7381.84 --> 7384.8
now

7383.599 --> 7387.599
yeah

7384.8 --> 7390.2390000000005
it rips the soul right out of you

7387.599 --> 7394.52
it's just about as entertaining as being

7390.239 --> 7394.5199999999995
like working in a call center

7395.36 --> 7400.759999999999
the soul has been ripped out of it

7401.6 --> 7404.81
[Music]

7616.4 --> 7620.719
might show me an actual channel then

7623.199 --> 7626.678999999999

7645.76 --> 7650.719
welcome to my channel

7647.92 --> 7650.719
one year ago

7652.159 --> 7656.199
fundraiser what

7669.199 --> 7672.199
okay

7682.239 --> 7684.5599999999995
hmm

7684.8 --> 7689.599
seems it does seem like a personal blog

7687.36 --> 7692.48
or something snippets

7689.599 --> 7693.92
it's all very short videos

7692.48 --> 7696.079
so it's just

7693.92 --> 7697.119
kind of an outlet of his statements or

7696.079 --> 7700.239
something

7697.119 --> 7700.239
anyway this is it

7701.04 --> 7707.4
oh you already posted that

7704.239 --> 7707.4
all right

7724.0 --> 7728.04
all right

7725.04 --> 7728.04
anyway

7739.36 --> 7745.32
man i'm really bummed out that there's

7741.199 --> 7745.32
no life letter at the bait

7752.19 --> 7755.259999999999
[Music]

7779.199 --> 7781.598999999999
right

7784.96 --> 7788.88
flat earthers hate it too much oh you

7786.8 --> 7793.04
mean they were full-on

7788.88 --> 7795.36
retards like they went full vr on him or

7793.04 --> 7796.96
was it rv on him

7795.36 --> 7798.799999999999
i bet they did

7796.96 --> 7801.04
because of course flat earthers would

7798.8 --> 7804.88
have to ruin it for actual flat earthers

7801.04 --> 7808.079
when somebody that isn't directly

7804.88 --> 7809.52
rooted in flat earth as they rise

7808.079 --> 7811.679
and they're approaching then of course

7809.52 --> 7814.8
they have to immediately invoke full

7811.679 --> 7819.04
savanya and just spout at them like

7814.8 --> 7820.88
weird flat earth or sjws

7819.04 --> 7822.8
of course they do

7820.88 --> 7826.84
immediately they have to show their

7822.8 --> 7830.719
absolute worst side because they're all

7826.84 --> 7832.0
disgusting slovenian [ __ ]

7830.719 --> 7835.599
that don't know what the [ __ ] they're

7832.0 --> 7837.36
doing and that believe in so much terror

7835.599 --> 7839.84
that they don't have like normal

7837.36 --> 7843.239
thinking left

7839.84 --> 7843.2390000000005
so yeah

7866.079 --> 7871.759999999999
my derpnum is your durability

7869.04 --> 7873.599
what's up vanier mean it's it's a vague

7871.76 --> 7875.84
vague reference

7873.599 --> 7877.76
sylvania is basically somebody that's

7875.84 --> 7881.1990000000005
like

7877.76 --> 7881.1990000000005
emotionally out of control

7881.92 --> 7886.32
basically what that is but

7883.92 --> 7890.56
sylvania is a paranoid

7886.32 --> 7893.5199999999995
usually megalomaniacal person

7890.56 --> 7895.599
that thinks that they are like

7893.52 --> 7898.0
the special boy about everything but

7895.599 --> 7899.360000000001
they're constantly like trying to trick

7898.0 --> 7901.92
everybody

7899.36 --> 7904.5599999999995
and bluff everybody

7901.92 --> 7907.92
instead of actually building it up

7904.56 --> 7911.92
they're gammas in nature

7907.92 --> 7914.56
eric dubay is very he basically invented

7911.92 --> 7917.679
the safari it's his attitude it's like

7914.56 --> 7917.679
his public attitude

7918.719 --> 7924.8
it's like and then that means that

7920.8 --> 7927.4400000000005
nobody that's supposedly in your

7924.8 --> 7930.56
description of the world so like nobody

7927.44 --> 7933.44
in nasa or government or hollywood could

7930.56 --> 7935.599
ever be a good person in any way with

7933.44 --> 7937.919999999999
any percentage right

7935.599 --> 7941.119000000001
and so then you overreact

7937.92 --> 7942.96
to that [ __ ] and that's

7941.119 --> 7944.639
a lot of people in flat earth do

7942.96 --> 7947.119
unfortunately eric dubai does do it

7944.639 --> 7950.4800000000005
although he has kind of like

7947.119 --> 7952.239
lessened the bit i think he is

7950.48 --> 7955.759999999999
he has been he's not getting worse at

7952.239 --> 7957.119
least right rv is worse and he is

7955.76 --> 7960.8
getting worse

7957.119 --> 7963.839999999999
worse and worse and worse just complete

7960.8 --> 7966.2390000000005
scam artist [ __ ] up

7963.84 --> 7966.2390000000005
liar

7966.88 --> 7971.84
slanderer about everything and everybody

7975.76 --> 7982.320000000001
so yeah the best example that i would be

7979.04 --> 7986.88
able to give of a savage

7982.32 --> 7986.88
in this current time period would be rv

7988.159 --> 7992.159
he's the best example of that

7990.4 --> 7998.159
what that is and everything that comes

7992.159 --> 8001.199
with it he is full on full on 100 savage

7998.159 --> 8004.598999999999
right he's more safonya than eric dubay

8001.199 --> 8004.598999999999
