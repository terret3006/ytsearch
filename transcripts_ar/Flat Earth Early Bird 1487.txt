and yeah nice I mean this is the first

137.879 --> 141.07999999999998
snow this winter

141.3 --> 145.739
foreign

142.56 --> 148.14000000000001
did not expect that

145.739 --> 151.20000000000002
well yeah there was something in the

148.14 --> 152.7
weather forecast I remember

151.2 --> 156.29999999999998
so

152.7 --> 161.099
but yeah I didn't take much note of it

156.3 --> 161.09900000000002
but I guess that it did happen huh

162.239 --> 168.18
hello tarot 306 first in chat good to

165.36 --> 170.81900000000002
see you on time today yeah

168.18 --> 173.22
mostly

170.819 --> 176.22
indeed

173.22 --> 176.22
foreign

176.7 --> 183.42
it is Friday the 20th of January 2023

184.86 --> 187.58
ah

186.05 --> 190.31900000000002
[Music]

187.58 --> 192.59900000000002
I feel pretty good

190.319 --> 195.23899999999998
decent dinner

192.599 --> 198.29999999999998
very decent

195.239 --> 201.84
some smokes

198.3 --> 205.08
oh man after the day before

201.84 --> 206.58
not like not smoking at all it did kind

205.08 --> 209.87900000000002
of make more impact but it's been

206.58 --> 212.70000000000002
interesting I've actually had a lot of

209.879 --> 216.42
also did

212.7 --> 218.879
Vision adjacent situations reflecting a

216.42 --> 222.48
lot also because Owen Benjamin just

218.879 --> 225.06
keeps talking about his experience and

222.48 --> 226.92
well I really relate to that in a

225.06 --> 231.78
different setting but I've touched upon

226.92 --> 235.26
that thing too and then I ruin it why

231.78 --> 237.84
because the way I am and I did not have

235.26 --> 240.0
impulse control so I would get angry

237.84 --> 241.92000000000002
over things and ruin it and then they

240.0 --> 243.959
would just like

241.92 --> 246.599
say you're no longer welcome really

243.959 --> 248.4
quickly and being apologetic would not

246.599 --> 250.85999999999999
help and I didn't even have the skill to

248.4 --> 253.28
do that it's just it's all so fresh to

250.86 --> 253.28
me I

253.86 --> 258.90000000000003
felt really ashamed over it most of it

256.979 --> 262.74
which

258.9 --> 263.69899999999996
I think is like that kind of [ __ ] me

262.74 --> 266.28000000000003
up

263.699 --> 269.479
it happened relatively early in life

266.28 --> 269.479
like early teens

270.6 --> 276.41900000000004
and I blocked it all out like

273.6 --> 279.0
the memory of it is like a vision it's

276.419 --> 282.06
highly compartmentalized like I think

279.0 --> 284.1
that when I entered that I really it

282.06 --> 286.86
like oh Benjamin says like in a way it's

284.1 --> 291.0
almost like you enter Heaven

286.86 --> 292.68
and I really felt that because I was as

291.0 --> 293.88
sensitive as I am now

292.68 --> 296.699
but

293.88 --> 299.04
I wanted to be so much part of that

296.699 --> 301.44
right

299.04 --> 303.18
I was I had that instinct like I want to

301.44 --> 304.5
be part of something I want to be part

303.18 --> 306.54
of this group we want to be part of what

304.5 --> 309.0
they're doing I want to be in on it

306.54 --> 312.41900000000004
right very curious

309.0 --> 315.06
and it just wanted to meld in so but

312.419 --> 318.35999999999996
people would just start to I get on

315.06 --> 320.82
their nerves and they just like know

318.36 --> 322.38
leave us alone

320.82 --> 324.539
they wouldn't let me in on things

322.38 --> 327.65999999999997
anymore

324.539 --> 328.56
and that just like yeah [ __ ] me up in

327.66 --> 331.02000000000004
a way

328.56 --> 333.24
couldn't deal with that

331.02 --> 335.75899999999996
and then I would basically go to

333.24 --> 338.16
reversed World setting

335.759 --> 341.16
it's it was very trauma it was painful

338.16 --> 343.32000000000005
and I would basically switch inside out

341.16 --> 348.02000000000004
and then I wouldn't be interested

343.32 --> 348.02
anymore and like my I became more

348.66 --> 353.28000000000003
acting

349.86 --> 356.82
but it's it's just like another layer

353.28 --> 359.52
and it it all I was very young like no I

356.82 --> 361.38
didn't plan it just worked that way

359.52 --> 362.34
it's like another side of me but it was

361.38 --> 365.4
very

362.34 --> 366.71999999999997
unpleasant it's like a hyper sarcasm

365.4 --> 369.539
where it's

366.72 --> 374.3
full suspense of disbelief form of

369.539 --> 374.3
sarcasm I think that might be it

375.24 --> 381.6
it is the Reversed rule

377.759 --> 385.02000000000004
if you dive far enough

381.6 --> 389.24
and I don't recommend that usually

385.02 --> 389.24
it would only trigger like when I

391.38 --> 395.12
great

392.639 --> 395.12
okay

396.06 --> 401.24
and that's thanks for disrupting my

398.1 --> 401.24
train of thinking great

402.72 --> 407.46000000000004
right

404.039 --> 411.18
was extremely compacted I know

407.46 --> 413.63899999999995
but that is now my problem is that I

411.18 --> 416.40000000000003
haven't really overcome the original

413.639 --> 417.479
situation I just kind of work my way

416.4 --> 422.4
around it

417.479 --> 425.28
but that extremely quick paced way of

422.4 --> 426.59999999999997
being in my spirit the hyperactive

425.28 --> 428.69899999999996
spirit that is what it is it's

426.6 --> 429.78000000000003
hyperactive

428.699 --> 432.24
like

429.78 --> 434.52
that is the frequency that I really

432.24 --> 436.8
function on

434.52 --> 441.419
naturally

436.8 --> 443.699
it's I'm just different that way

441.419 --> 446.69899999999996
but yeah when I get really enthusiastic

443.699 --> 449.24
then I become like kind of clumsy

446.699 --> 449.24
socially

454.979 --> 460.56
or I used to at least but like

457.699 --> 463.699
maintaining a lid on it has become just

460.56 --> 463.699
a really big skill

464.16 --> 470.759
right but yeah if I'm upset about

467.16 --> 473.58000000000004
something then that is really

470.759 --> 476.099
then I can really lose it I like I can

473.58 --> 478.56
really just lose that skill ability

476.099 --> 481.139
because I couldn't reach it anymore it's

478.56 --> 483.599
really annoying

481.139 --> 486.48
so it is kind of tricky balancing it out

483.599 --> 489.959
like how sensitive I am

486.48 --> 489.959
