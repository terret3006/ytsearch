0.0 --> 9.679
probably gonna be new hello welcome back

5.069 --> 12.96
I got a serious Internet Total Wipeout

9.679 --> 15.839
to actually restart the electricity in

12.96 --> 18.18
the entire apartment thanks for the

15.839 --> 20.91
great timing I don't know if this is a

18.18 --> 24.81
new hangout or if it's actually gonna be

20.91 --> 27.9
a continuation but I refuse to cut off

24.81 --> 32.61
at this point I will not be discouraged

27.9 --> 35.46
by no freaking electricity [ __ ] and yeah

32.61 --> 39.059
it ruined my mood but I'll get over it

35.46 --> 41.989000000000004
so yeah thank you guys see they're still

39.059 --> 41.989
there thank God

42.739 --> 47.07
all right Reese what do you think no but

45.149 --> 49.649
I said you know I as I say I can't I

47.07 --> 53.129
can't I'm a good I'm a good I'm as good

49.649 --> 55.410000000000004
a person as I can be as it's possible

53.129 --> 58.349999999999994
I've only I'm gonna give that person um

55.41 --> 60.538999999999994
I really do think all those and some

58.35 --> 62.010000000000005
things to the point now I'm dead to me

60.539 --> 66.26
to myself and I think that's something

62.01 --> 69.39
to do with you know would you call it

66.26 --> 71.46000000000001
maybe not insecurities but not enough

69.39 --> 75.0
given myself enough love I don't we go

71.46 --> 78.36
kumbaya I'm gonna practicals Bank up but

75.0 --> 80.04
you know what to give you know to give

78.36 --> 81.869
more to others and you actually give

80.04 --> 84.869
yourself I think the point is we should

81.869 --> 87.63
give ourselves it first and Liam oh and

84.869 --> 89.52
then that'll manifest and you know I

87.63 --> 93.17999999999999
mean be complete before we can take

89.52 --> 94.86
nothing so that's a little bit 11 I see

93.18 --> 96.869
myself sir there's a good person up

94.86 --> 98.729
trying to do the right thing I believe

96.869 --> 101.509
in it all the principles don't kill

98.729 --> 104.549
don't cheapen still respect everybody

101.509 --> 106.89
you know don't hate I don't hear anybody

104.549 --> 111.299
and you're angry people are get pissed

106.89 --> 113.909
off but I do adore Harbor negative

111.299 --> 117.18
emotions I like to keep myself positive

113.909 --> 121.049
because you know and my belief that bad

117.18 --> 123.149
thoughts create bad juju and say the man

121.049 --> 125.22900000000001
you can make a sell Elway by thought so

123.149 --> 127.659
I came

125.229 --> 129.72899999999998
you know and it's hard but as I see you

127.659 --> 131.08
know as I see resets it's like what do

129.729 --> 133.54000000000002
you think you know I'm on um

131.08 --> 135.84900000000002
how could you convince me logistic to

133.54 --> 138.01
that bet step further and show me how it

135.849 --> 140.26
would be a belief because I do already

138.01 --> 142.66
appreciate way for similarly that and

140.26 --> 145.51
stuff and I know respect and you know I

142.66 --> 147.819
hope what extra step do you think I

145.51 --> 150.48
could take or hey we did way I'm a late

147.819 --> 156.129
than that maybe nothing first of all

150.48 --> 158.14
your your approach to the Bible is well

156.129 --> 161.01899999999998
received by many people of faith that

158.14 --> 163.98899999999998
that couldn't be the words of God in the

161.019 --> 166.48000000000002
Bible because it's so bloodthirsty and

163.989 --> 169.93
it's all those flies binome actions but

166.48 --> 172.29899999999998
it's just like that exactly exactly

169.93 --> 174.64000000000001
emotions are ganba emotions and thoughts

172.299 --> 177.67000000000002
it's not exactly and the first of all

174.64 --> 179.73899999999998
you know the the oldest man you know the

177.67 --> 181.69
the oldest of closest manuscripts are

179.739 --> 183.64000000000001
like a thousand years after Jesus you

181.69 --> 186.069
know that's that's what they have and

183.64 --> 190.75
none of the manuscripts 24,000

186.069 --> 192.60899999999998
manuscripts are the same so when I talk

190.75 --> 196.45
about you know when I talk about using

192.609 --> 198.81
the Koran to verify you know what Jesus

196.45 --> 201.57899999999998
brought had to be for every you know to

198.81 --> 203.95
for for everybody who read it to be able

201.579 --> 206.92000000000002
to relate to it and then the following

203.95 --> 208.959
message had to make sense as well right

206.92 --> 211.0
but what you're talking about like the

208.959 --> 213.16
other day about going out Christmastime

211.0 --> 215.139
and giving somebody 50 pounds maybe you

213.16 --> 217.42
find on the street exactly in the Koran

215.139 --> 220.45000000000002
it talks about those who carry a heavy

217.42 --> 222.79
weight and and give to the beautiful you

220.45 --> 228.22
know first and foremost God wants a good

222.79 --> 230.85899999999998
person you know so I'm certainly not you

228.22 --> 236.17
know guaranteeing myself heaven you know

230.859 --> 240.19
what I mean I I certainly do not

236.17 --> 243.22
guarantee myself entry to heaven yeah a

240.19 --> 245.019
great tribute my made no money there's

243.22 --> 246.79
my friends in London I lived in a Muslim

245.019 --> 249.37
community I used to equal I mean Everson

246.79 --> 250.959
take those are families and stuff but

249.37 --> 253.299
that's the thing I have to see I'm very

250.959 --> 255.43
very charitable you know there really

253.299 --> 256.75
are I mean he even says this is what I'm

255.43 --> 259.09000000000003
saying even the Koran is

256.75 --> 261.549
some beautiful beautiful things and it

259.09 --> 265.11999999999995
but they only just met you know it's

261.549 --> 268.69
yeah it's just that confusion but most

265.12 --> 270.13
Muslims they eagle with a the good bets

268.69 --> 272.02
that I've legs you know that king of

270.13 --> 274.93
them be charitable love the knee bar

272.02 --> 277.63
blah blah this and that and somehow some

274.93 --> 281.56
of the as Arwen said maybe the darkish

277.63 --> 282.21999999999997
bets of being taken up by people maybe

281.56 --> 285.1
less

282.22 --> 288.85
you know maybe lost them hungry yeah

285.1 --> 291.40000000000003
that's a yeah they actually by being

288.85 --> 295.93
what they are exclude the very teachings

291.4 --> 298.419
that they champion supposedly it's yeah

295.93 --> 301.45
it's what happens it's exactly what the

298.419 --> 303.25
Vatican does with the Bible it's it's

301.45 --> 306.03999999999996
all of it all of it

303.25 --> 308.77
and you think that you think that's done

306.04 --> 310.6
with with with purpose to actually

308.77 --> 313.63
separate people you know even though

310.6 --> 316.27000000000004
there is a clear ray as the Huggies

313.63 --> 318.52
claims or edits are good about sin or

316.27 --> 320.68
well God said that's we should go a war

318.52 --> 322.35999999999996
and let's do not say nothing just think

320.68 --> 324.13
that's actually these people nicely do

322.36 --> 326.59000000000003
not some puppies to turn people away

324.13 --> 328.71999999999997
from the actual fact that there isn't

326.59 --> 330.84999999999997
career you know as these are the mad

328.72 --> 334.09000000000003
thoughts and I guess like no you know

330.85 --> 336.97
you just monopolize on it they just say

334.09 --> 340.27
no look I'm the creator I know best

336.97 --> 344.44000000000005
let's do my plan I help build my Empire

340.27 --> 346.27
and in doing so they basically violate

344.44 --> 351.28
the very God that they pretend to

346.27 --> 356.28999999999996
champion yeah and they all turn out

351.28 --> 358.03
doing that or they those that let the

356.29 --> 362.19
spirit of the controllers that

358.03 --> 365.2
methodology take them over and dominate

362.19 --> 368.729
they are always the ones that end up

365.2 --> 371.59
yeah turning a religion into an empire

368.729 --> 373.419
it was like I just remember the Iraq war

371.59 --> 375.36999999999995
there was there was a thinking I mean

373.419 --> 376.53999999999996
actually it was a it was a group of

375.37 --> 378.91
Christians who were called Christians

376.54 --> 381.72900000000004
for war and they were actually

378.91 --> 383.22900000000004
encouraging your I sling collagen at

381.729 --> 386.349
Juma Iraq while they were actually

383.229 --> 390.45
encouraging own embalming in the hell oh

386.349 --> 390.45
it was good I never swore leo

391.28 --> 399.229
a bombing the hell of the Iraq and these

396.56 --> 401.09
questions I was like on my Norway you

399.229 --> 403.09999999999997
know and that it's that kind of thing

401.09 --> 404.84
not that a Kazan walking secretly that

403.1 --> 407.6
I'm not you know one more that all my

404.84 --> 410.15
goodness and authorized a ssin it's in

407.6 --> 414.5
the heads of both these false empires

410.15 --> 418.94
basically saying yeah let's do get out

414.5 --> 422.419
and get more control just like the old

418.94 --> 425.389
kingdoms of Europe would the King of

422.419 --> 429.139
France the King of England or whatever I

425.389 --> 432.56
would say yeah you know what let's

429.139 --> 436.28000000000003
attack each other let's have war and in

432.56 --> 438.62
do I know like give ya incentive to our

436.28 --> 441.13899999999995
public to do their best for that country

438.62 --> 443.449
and get a lot of them killed so we can

441.139 --> 448.16
keep it under control and now the

443.449 --> 450.02000000000004
religions it's the same methodology it's

448.16 --> 455.36
the controller methodology is the

450.02 --> 457.34
phoenicians way you know then it puts us

455.36 --> 458.87
off you know it puts people off us less

457.34 --> 461.75
thing because there's a certain offense

458.87 --> 464.09000000000003
but if I was to go either we begged

461.75 --> 467.81
buying of Korea they are everything

464.09 --> 469.4
everything every dog science people's

467.81 --> 471.11
and honest I mean I'm really doing a

469.4 --> 473.59
laconic what science says about it and

471.11 --> 476.97900000000004
they have not got a clue at the

473.59 --> 479.75
fundamental levels that all gases play

476.979 --> 481.43
extrapolations heavy fairly clap and

479.75 --> 483.8
these baller ideas that come and

481.43 --> 486.139
challenge me on saying that know nothing

483.8 --> 488.36
about this second and not even the thing

486.139 --> 489.86
is I'd do certain offense and I look I

488.36 --> 492.86
really do have the ability in work as

489.86 --> 494.96000000000004
across some things because yeah because

492.86 --> 497.12
education all sorts of trouble being

494.96 --> 498.62
offense as Shep you know I've loved me

497.12 --> 501.11
all my life King not being able to see

498.62 --> 503.27
the two sides their story okay no thanks

501.11 --> 505.34000000000003
rock it I can even you are and on one

503.27 --> 507.02
subject and then I could see the other

505.34 --> 508.76
side if someone was arguing against you

507.02 --> 511.15999999999997
I could see oh yeah but I see your way

508.76 --> 512.9
as well and I know a Landsat cause burns

511.16 --> 515.8100000000001
as I see if I was going to take a leak

512.9 --> 516.65
right it would be on the side are as

515.81 --> 518.81
that clear

516.65 --> 520.669
never never never it happened by

518.81 --> 523.579
accident ten years

520.669 --> 525.92
you know all the science points are that

523.579 --> 529.37
we should not be here in the story like

525.92 --> 532.01
planes should never fly we should never

529.37 --> 534.019
be here man your mathematics says the

532.01 --> 536.899
claims should not be away flying is

534.019 --> 538.94
impossible but they do they do they do

536.899 --> 540.95
equate with a lottery as well right well

538.94 --> 544.07
that's because mathematics is based on

540.95 --> 544.6700000000001
deduction ISM and when you deduce you

544.07 --> 549.2600000000001
take away

544.67 --> 552.41
it doesn't actually reveal the depth of

549.26 --> 553.9399999999999
what you can't see yet so you're always

552.41 --> 556.2199999999999
going to be working with what you got

553.94 --> 558.769
and then try to extrapolate some kind of

556.22 --> 561.98
pattern out of it well if there's entire

558.769 --> 564.5
swathes of data that you just never even

561.98 --> 566.149
glanced that you're gonna be missing the

564.5 --> 571.76
bigger picture and it's not gonna work

566.149 --> 574.73
out yeah yep yeah totally with you then

571.76 --> 577.399
math is just a tool you know it's it's

574.73 --> 579.98
like a ruler like you who I got a ruler

577.399 --> 582.44
of 30 centimeters I can measure things

579.98 --> 585.0500000000001
up to 30 centimeters and if they're

582.44 --> 587.48
longer then I can't custom you know

585.05 --> 589.2199999999999
there's not big enough then you have to

587.48 --> 591.32
deduct then you have to look at it well

589.22 --> 594.35
my ruler looks half the size of that so

591.32 --> 596.72
I deduce the the things didn't up there

594.35 --> 598.5500000000001
he sent me a sexy like a nothing even

596.72 --> 601.5790000000001
what could be that what you're selling

598.55 --> 614.149
there no I mean put your thumb there and

601.579 --> 623.6899999999999
move the ruler yeah I think you're ruled

614.149 --> 625.04
by bombs never means thumbs yeah you see

623.69 --> 627.649
then you read the Koran have you ever

625.04 --> 630.0699999999999
listened to it I never listened to you

627.649 --> 632.72
know oh well maybe on tenth one one time

630.07 --> 635.48
like audiobook I've never fallen asleep

632.72 --> 637.9100000000001
I almost leaped up you know I do that

635.48 --> 641.0500000000001
some things were audiobooks I've done

637.91 --> 641.05
that with a Torah

641.74 --> 650.0
yes real sorry there's one verse chapter

645.17 --> 652.76
3 verse 7 and every time I hear it it

650.0 --> 656.44
pulls my heart you're not I mean like it

652.76 --> 659.72
it pulls me to listen to it you know so

656.44 --> 662.84
if you can listen to chapter 3 verse 7

659.72 --> 665.3000000000001
and see how you react to it in your mind

662.84 --> 666.14
and then read what the meaning is even

665.3 --> 669.8599999999999
in that order

666.14 --> 671.75
yeah I think I think you I think he was

669.86 --> 675.62
kind of see it you know because the

671.75 --> 680.96
Quran means the recitation you know and

675.62 --> 683.6
so it can be it can be son from start to

680.96 --> 686.63
finish you know that's the that's the

683.6 --> 690.5
amazing thing about the Quran so yeah

686.63 --> 691.76
anybody I was down to 3 verse 7 about

690.5 --> 694.61
wasn't to the whole thing again because

691.76 --> 696.56
I see up north I've not read these books

694.61 --> 698.84
for years that nice was years and years

696.56 --> 700.6999999999999
ago well years and years ago but five

698.84 --> 702.95
years ago ah I don't know what I've

700.7 --> 706.5500000000001
eaten any religion and stuff like yeah

702.95 --> 709.5200000000001
there's a great translation done in 2007

706.55 --> 716.6899999999999
it's called the reformist translation

709.52 --> 719.63
and it two men and one woman so it

716.69 --> 724.19
doesn't have that you know that bias

719.63 --> 725.6899999999999
inside it we meet you Archie yeah yeah

724.19 --> 728.0300000000001
how do I like to use that word to start

725.69 --> 730.3100000000001
around but it's like I have different

728.03 --> 732.3199999999999
versions and I read and sometimes I get

730.31 --> 733.88
a really rich meaning from reading that

732.32 --> 736.3100000000001
that one you know what I mean cuz it's

733.88 --> 738.71
it's using the translations before it

736.31 --> 741.2299999999999
that are most commonly read but when it

738.71 --> 743.72
when it starts to talk about equality

741.23 --> 745.97
and things of that nature I feel it it

743.72 --> 751.07
gets a better grasp on it sometimes so

745.97 --> 754.85
you know oh yeah I'll put I'll put the

751.07 --> 759.47
UM I'll put the book in the in the Flat

754.85 --> 761.51
Earth chat feed on skype so you can get

759.47 --> 762.86
it from there alright I've got on my

761.51 --> 765.3199999999999
computer I've got on my boots

762.86 --> 767.27
I've got my books I've got our libraries

765.32 --> 770.2
it's probably the size of the library

767.27 --> 773.59
Alexandria sound mother computer

770.2 --> 775.45
where all my eight years of research in

773.59 --> 778.4200000000001
different topics or books and in within

775.45 --> 781.3000000000001
months or I'll just go back but alright

778.42 --> 783.13
I'm good I'm going to audiobook I'm good

781.3 --> 787.9
actually a lesson to actually listen to

783.13 --> 792.28
the what yeah that's that's what was

787.9 --> 795.28
asked to be replicated you know and no

792.28 --> 797.14
one's been able to replicate any one

795.28 --> 799.9599999999999
verse and then one of the final

797.14 --> 802.33
challenge is make one chapter like it

799.96 --> 805.5400000000001
you know and the smallest chapter is

802.33 --> 808.0600000000001
three verses and still fourteen hundred

805.54 --> 811.8299999999999
and forty years later nobody has been

808.06 --> 814.63
now but to complete the challenge so

811.83 --> 816.94
it's such a challenge against or TV

814.63 --> 819.91
sport was a challenge so the first the

816.94 --> 822.97
first chapter says you know make a book

819.91 --> 826.18
like this you know the second check

822.97 --> 829.0
challenges make ten chapters like this

826.18 --> 832.03
and then the final one says make one

829.0 --> 834.48
chapter like this you know and so using

832.03 --> 837.25
the smallest chapter you know and

834.48 --> 839.44
nobody's being able to do it and you'd

837.25 --> 844.56
think that with all the you know all the

839.44 --> 847.72
hate against the faithful there would be

844.56 --> 850.81
there would be the X Muslims that would

847.72 --> 853.03
get together with you know atheists and

850.81 --> 855.0699999999999
use their language knowledge and try to

853.03 --> 856.72
put something together and you know

855.07 --> 858.73
you'd think with all the ability with

856.72 --> 861.88
technology and everything they could do

858.73 --> 864.4200000000001
it but they just can't the funny thing

861.88 --> 867.85
is you know most atheists rate of

864.42 --> 870.25
actually being members of churches like

867.85 --> 874.15
a la Steve McClean he was he was a

870.25 --> 875.83
Mormon I think and all the only known

874.15 --> 878.11
sake well if you can hear that it's

875.83 --> 880.69
actually crazy Palestinian cities and

878.11 --> 882.5500000000001
cray are you serious yeah yeah yeah yeah

880.69 --> 884.6800000000001
he really look I mean I'm telling you

882.55 --> 886.6899999999999
the amount of people that used to be

884.68 --> 889.9
religious right and what's happened is

886.69 --> 891.5200000000001
right what math math even as people that

889.9 --> 893.47
don't believe in God when they get

891.52 --> 895.3
trauma tell me straight they're looking

893.47 --> 898.87
for something and the more susceptible

895.3 --> 900.79
the embrace God ray and I think it's the

898.87 --> 902.95
opposite way as above so below the

900.79 --> 905.3499999999999
opposite we people that have been

902.95 --> 907.3900000000001
and religion right and got traumatized

905.35 --> 910.0600000000001
not be buying the religion I've seen

907.39 --> 911.86
laughter I'm off and went to the wind to

910.06 --> 914.8
become an atheist it's like the scene

911.86 --> 917.17
it's the it's both yeah exactly that's

914.8 --> 918.66
what I'm seeing it's like both no take

917.17 --> 922.7199999999999
not one stick for the most reliable

918.66 --> 925.93
that's how I rolled into atheism in the

922.72 --> 930.5500000000001
gothic scene because I was just exposed

925.93 --> 933.01
to the the weird details of what people

930.55 --> 936.2199999999999
did in churches and the corruption and

933.01 --> 937.99
of course they overexposed me with every

936.22 --> 940.6
detail trying to exclude anything

937.99 --> 944.44
potentially good but I only figured that

940.6 --> 947.08
out afterward like oh [ __ ] I've been in

944.44 --> 950.08
bed like [ __ ] on these people while

947.08 --> 954.61
whoa they may have actually have a point

950.08 --> 957.2800000000001
and I started doing that and just like

954.61 --> 959.95
okay now everybody has their own angle

957.28 --> 963.4
to things only the only thing you can do

959.95 --> 965.8900000000001
is try to do it right from whatever

963.4 --> 969.25
point you're you are in your life

965.89 --> 975.01
basically and how could you find your

969.25 --> 977.2
way find the path through yep yeah I've

975.01 --> 980.8
got Jehovah's Witnesses coming to my

977.2 --> 982.45
house tomorrow they come they come

980.8 --> 984.3399999999999
enough started coming every week cuz I

982.45 --> 986.11
invited the men last week and we sat

984.34 --> 988.72
down you were talking about what and uh

986.11 --> 992.41
feels and all this kind of stuff and I

988.72 --> 995.44
was I was I was using their language to

992.41 --> 997.3299999999999
explain what was what I perceive is

995.44 --> 999.22
what's going on and stuff like that but

997.33 --> 1001.38
not like the Lord lay concealed women

999.22 --> 1003.4200000000001
aren't he came to stuff I was asking

1001.38 --> 1005.4
them they came to using that Socratic

1003.42 --> 1008.2199999999999
method doing them hey thanks for that

1005.4 --> 1010.23
coming back I love talking it's not you

1008.22 --> 1012.6
know I I was like you are when I used to

1010.23 --> 1015.87
be a seriously when I was like 16 17 18

1012.6 --> 1018.87
I used to take the path of religion and

1015.87 --> 1020.97
stuff line people and and seem the same

1018.87 --> 1023.7
old cliches all the old testament

1020.97 --> 1026.16
working bonding babies and eating babies

1023.7 --> 1027.959
man or like any stupid argument that

1026.16 --> 1030.1200000000001
wasn't even anything mean for me that

1027.959 --> 1033.92
was I didn't even look at it

1030.12 --> 1035.9899999999998
okay I was kind of afraid of it

1033.92 --> 1040.19
afraid of knowing no I was just

1035.99 --> 1042.47
reflecting on the people in in the

1040.19 --> 1045.589
churches on what they were doing on how

1042.47 --> 1048.53
they were supposedly wielding their

1045.589 --> 1050.4199999999998
principles that's what I was focused on

1048.53 --> 1053.1499999999999
and I just saw the the the the

1050.42 --> 1056.39
corruption basically and and the

1053.15 --> 1059.69
two-facedness of a lot of people in

1056.39 --> 1061.6100000000001
there and that's what told me like no

1059.69 --> 1066.2
this is not a good place for me to

1061.61 --> 1069.7099999999998
settle they're wrong but I didn't even

1066.2 --> 1070.45
really really dare to look into the

1069.71 --> 1074.45
Bible

1070.45 --> 1079.22
back then it was also discouraged even

1074.45 --> 1081.89
by my freaky freaky friends lettuce

1079.22 --> 1083.54
garlic hmm do you have people on the

1081.89 --> 1086.3300000000002
street Owen where you live

1083.54 --> 1088.52
hmm you have like preachers on the

1086.33 --> 1090.5
street saying like you know you know go

1088.52 --> 1092.24
ahead and hold all the rest of it no

1090.5 --> 1097.91
cream in it you know now they all got

1092.24 --> 1100.13
rid of that in the 90s you know I think

1097.91 --> 1101.8400000000001
was kind of pushed away growing up

1100.13 --> 1105.14
because he's gonna it's almost like

1101.84 --> 1106.76
these people were snipping themselves in

1105.14 --> 1109.22
front of the crowd and saying I already

1106.76 --> 1111.64
know that I'm saved I already know I'm

1109.22 --> 1115.1000000000001
going to heaven you know and it's like

1111.64 --> 1117.41
how can you how can you guarantee

1115.1 --> 1119.54
yourself anything you know what I mean

1117.41 --> 1121.3700000000001
you can't even guarantee yourself

1119.54 --> 1124.31
tomorrow right and it didn't make any

1121.37 --> 1127.3999999999999
sense for me you know much of it was

1124.31 --> 1129.8
like oh yeah I know the Bible so well

1127.4 --> 1132.98
I've got all these exams where I learn

1129.8 --> 1135.49
every detail yet every Sunday yeah you

1132.98 --> 1139.22
you come driving up in your Mercedes

1135.49 --> 1141.34
wearing all this fancy hat [ __ ] like you

1139.22 --> 1144.16
like you're the queen or something and

1141.34 --> 1150.56
then think that everything that's like

1144.16 --> 1151.7900000000002
what I think maybe I'll see that yeah I

1150.56 --> 1153.98
think they live in a different reality

1151.79 --> 1155.12
you know I mean like you know how we can

1153.98 --> 1157.22
see things in myself

1155.12 --> 1159.56
everybody looks it things in there I

1157.22 --> 1161.6000000000001
think they actually you know I like the

1159.56 --> 1163.25
elites of disconnected all actors the

1161.6 --> 1165.9199999999998
famous people that King I think that's

1163.25 --> 1167.63
connected from the well actually the

1165.92 --> 1169.43
common what they call me man

1167.63 --> 1171.89
the majority of people living in iguana

1169.43 --> 1174.14
it's what he's seen as a best connector

1171.89 --> 1176.42
not like Neal looking they're looking

1174.14 --> 1178.43
through real glasses or a weird

1176.42 --> 1180.47
perception of how life is I think not

1178.43 --> 1182.54
totally disconnected for long I think

1180.47 --> 1184.97
that a lot of them bother beating me up

1182.54 --> 1187.22
I think that a lot of them especially

1184.97 --> 1189.89
like they're the richer types with in

1187.22 --> 1193.58
religions kind of see it like a game

1189.89 --> 1196.2800000000002
like a game that they master and become

1193.58 --> 1198.74
the best at just like they master

1196.28 --> 1201.44
dealing with society and gathering

1198.74 --> 1202.97
wealth and being on top of the markets

1201.44 --> 1205.73
and all that and they just start to

1202.97 --> 1208.75
regard it as a game and they so they

1205.73 --> 1212.3600000000001
they don't look into it with their

1208.75 --> 1214.94
timeless spirit anymore they just

1212.36 --> 1217.9099999999999
approach it superficially and they look

1214.94 --> 1220.31
stuff because of it they don't they just

1217.91 --> 1222.38
use deductive the deductive reasoning

1220.31 --> 1225.77
kind of thing in the mess in there the

1222.38 --> 1227.99
intricacies over right it's like they're

1225.77 --> 1231.59
not really in touch with it because they

1227.99 --> 1233.9
are distracted by the bubbles by by

1231.59 --> 1237.73
upholding the methodologies that they

1233.9 --> 1241.25
are using to be successful in society

1237.73 --> 1246.02
yeah and that was my main problem with

1241.25 --> 1248.3
with religion back then but yeah but

1246.02 --> 1250.49
it's not that it's that is an

1248.3 --> 1254.33
oversimplification by itself because

1250.49 --> 1257.3
yeah there's people from all angles in

1254.33 --> 1260.1499999999999
all these religions and you can't just

1257.3 --> 1263.72
put them all over one comb and do it

1260.15 --> 1266.0
away declare it evil I think it's the

1263.72 --> 1269.81
way it's distributed the the the won't

1266.0 --> 1272.87
because you know it's not the religion

1269.81 --> 1274.82
that's the danger or the belief in God

1272.87 --> 1276.9799999999998
that's a danger it's the people are

1274.82 --> 1278.99
interpreting and telling other people

1276.98 --> 1281.63
it's their interpretation that's the

1278.99 --> 1284.03
engine so there's nothing wrong way they

1281.63 --> 1286.0700000000002
regard or or the belief in God or

1284.03 --> 1289.6399999999999
whatever I've got a problem the way it's

1286.07 --> 1292.8799999999999
presented the the way is have the

1289.64 --> 1294.8300000000002
hypocrisy and album okay but that's very

1292.88 --> 1296.8200000000002
hard to say it like that because we are

1294.83 --> 1298.289
also interpreted it

1296.82 --> 1299.789
in their own way and somebody else may

1298.289 --> 1302.6
say oh oh look they're doing exactly

1299.789 --> 1305.9089999999999
what they say is wrong I'd like to say

1302.6 --> 1310.49
that it's the institutionalization in

1305.909 --> 1317.6100000000001
general making a system for it to drive

1310.49 --> 1320.159
some kind of yeah and an empire or a a

1317.61 --> 1322.4089999999999
growing system that the

1320.159 --> 1324.1200000000001
institutionalization that is really the

1322.409 --> 1326.669
real damage it's not even people's

1324.12 --> 1329.9899999999998
interpretation because yet we are

1326.669 --> 1333.929
supposed to interpret it in our own way

1329.99 --> 1335.85
it's it's just forcing it upon your

1333.929 --> 1341.009
interpretation upon others therefore

1335.85 --> 1344.1589999999999
persecution or just taking it as another

1341.009 --> 1348.09
tool as it has a bubble basically that's

1344.159 --> 1351.3890000000001
where it goes wrong really Institute

1348.09 --> 1353.34
organization well what resonated with me

1351.389 --> 1355.37
is not obscene I don't know whether that

1353.34 --> 1359.639
was Jesus said or some college

1355.37 --> 1363.5089999999998
attributed to him or some your body is a

1359.639 --> 1365.309
temple that's what always resonated with

1363.509 --> 1369.029
me not meeting me thank us it oh so I

1365.309 --> 1370.83
don't wanna actually means and then I as

1369.029 --> 1373.59
I see off came up when one came up this

1370.83 --> 1378.99
is what I came up with more my own

1373.59 --> 1381.72
interpretation about but it's like yeah

1378.99 --> 1387.09
it's there's no ambiguity between lotion

1381.72 --> 1391.019
or cold steel or smiling or did someone

1387.09 --> 1393.6589999999999
get Snape what noise back no no no I

1391.019 --> 1395.809
think I think you do I thought because

1393.659 --> 1400.25
dance read a drop then only sheep oh I

1395.809 --> 1400.25
thought oh [ __ ] somebody's sniping

1400.889 --> 1406.859
I had to restart on my phone it wouldn't

1404.259 --> 1406.859
stop judging

1410.61 --> 1416.4599999999998
you know yeah sorry for it I missed the

1413.669 --> 1419.22
whole I miss the whole conversation is

1416.46 --> 1420.419
probably behind now I thought why do you

1419.22 --> 1425.63
bother just talking about you behind

1420.419 --> 1429.5600000000002
your back but it was all mace it was all

1425.63 --> 1429.5600000000002
[Laughter]

1435.38 --> 1443.8200000000002
oh good yeah yeah yeah we talked about

1439.47 --> 1448.769
that too sometimes on this show but I

1443.82 --> 1451.83
was thinking that we have like the Flat

1448.769 --> 1458.01
Earth Awards right well what if we just

1451.83 --> 1460.799
call it the Nobel Prize awesome that is

1458.01 --> 1463.4089999999999
absolutely awesome that's it that's the

1460.799 --> 1466.789
neat month that's blowing that's a blow

1463.409 --> 1471.0590000000002
in Himalaya the Nobel Prize for exactly

1466.789 --> 1474.09

1480.72 --> 1484.44
watch that did you watch it as well we

1482.549 --> 1486.57
saw just one year's opinion or natural

1484.44 --> 1490.26
that documentary did you guys watch that

1486.57 --> 1496.59
at all oh yeah yeah what do you guys

1490.26 --> 1499.94
think about it they haven't looked at

1496.59 --> 1502.289
I've seen I've seen the movie I

1499.94 --> 1503.94
recognized immediately I spoke out about

1502.289 --> 1506.34
it on the early bird show like oh yeah

1503.94 --> 1509.29
David set him up it's very sneaky very

1506.34 --> 1511.84
first world --is--

1509.29 --> 1513.46
and yeah they had their response and

1511.84 --> 1515.98
globe busters I don't know what what

1513.46 --> 1519.46
else came out of it so yeah please

1515.98 --> 1521.32
please do share no no I would just think

1519.46 --> 1524.41
you know someone made a venue oh boy oh

1521.32 --> 1526.06
sorry Rhys sorry when you go there

1524.41 --> 1527.44
oh well what did your opinion on the

1526.06 --> 1534.6299999999999
film what did you think of the film as

1527.44 --> 1534.63
well I I think it it tried to focus on

1536.13 --> 1541.69
like it didn't it didn't really allow

1539.17 --> 1543.0700000000002
the critical thinkers to have this say

1541.69 --> 1546.22
you know I mean it was it was a lot

1543.07 --> 1548.02
about just showing the community and

1546.22 --> 1551.89
things like that and there was a lot of

1548.02 --> 1554.05
focus you know on on the relationship

1551.89 --> 1556.39
possibility mark sided thing and I

1554.05 --> 1558.37
thought that was kind of strange it's

1556.39 --> 1561.1000000000001
it's like they had other material but

1558.37 --> 1562.8899999999999
they they decided you know should come

1561.1 --> 1565.36
from a certain angle it might have been

1562.89 --> 1566.95
advertised as a neutral angle mean hey

1565.36 --> 1569.9799999999998
we're just gonna give the side of it but

1566.95 --> 1573.6100000000001
then you know what I mean and then yeah

1569.98 --> 1578.65
it's it's it's hard it's hard to say

1573.61 --> 1582.31
because it if it focused on people who

1578.65 --> 1584.1100000000001
have I don't know have been in the

1582.31 --> 1586.3899999999999
limelight and being in debates and stuff

1584.11 --> 1590.1
and coming off what they've been through

1586.39 --> 1594.88
they haven't you know then I guess I

1590.1 --> 1598.78
don't know it's just this idea that they

1594.88 --> 1600.97
have the idea and I don't know it's seen

1598.78 --> 1603.37
it put against them you know what I mean

1600.97 --> 1604.69
like the way they would cut and switch

1603.37 --> 1606.4899999999998
and change it was like what else

1604.69 --> 1609.0700000000002
happened to them in that bit you know

1606.49 --> 1611.86
what I mean and stuff like that son you

1609.07 --> 1614.2
know I bet she what I wasn't yeah what I

1611.86 --> 1617.4399999999998
what I took away from it was you know a

1614.2 --> 1620.05
whole bunch of good-hearted people you

1617.44 --> 1622.27
know just just you know just trying to

1620.05 --> 1624.09
share you know just trying to write

1622.27 --> 1626.65
trying to yeah you know

1624.09 --> 1628.6899999999998
live-and-let-live but just have their

1626.65 --> 1631.51
own thoughts and be appreciative for who

1628.69 --> 1633.49
they were and I think by switching and

1631.51 --> 1635.65
changing into this you know professional

1633.49 --> 1637.03
sitting behind a desk with all the you

1635.65 --> 1640.42
know this suits on and everything I

1637.03 --> 1642.19
think it was I think it was an unfair

1640.42 --> 1643.03
approach you know there was there wasn't

1642.19 --> 1644.65
enough for these P

1643.03 --> 1647.8899999999999
we're talking directly with the Flat

1644.65 --> 1651.49
Earth and it was baby it was a bunch of

1647.89 --> 1653.5600000000002
gossip yeah yeah yeah well done Harvin

1651.49 --> 1654.34
yeah there's just what we said the other

1653.56 --> 1656.1399999999999
was normal

1654.34 --> 1658.74
there was no I actually said only a

1656.14 --> 1661.75
critical thinker or you know like ah

1658.74 --> 1663.3700000000001
there was no conclusions drawn from why

1661.75 --> 1666.13
are you in the flat okay nothing it's

1663.37 --> 1668.1999999999998
like Oh Massa and no well they did

1666.13 --> 1670.75
actually make up conspiracy theories

1668.2 --> 1673.75
about that all they need because they're

1670.75 --> 1675.76
so wrong and they need kinship as a

1673.75 --> 1678.7
consolidation and that's why they're

1675.76 --> 1680.95
doing it no they went conspiracy like

1678.7 --> 1684.91
psychological conspiracy theory all over

1680.95 --> 1687.6100000000001
the place so yeah but it was just nasty

1684.91 --> 1689.89
it was gossip behind their backs not to

1687.61 --> 1692.53
the faces never

1689.89 --> 1695.0800000000002
and they yeah it was a usually it was

1692.53 --> 1697.69
just like a discord surfer bunch of

1695.08 --> 1698.77
gossip but more fence they wouldn't

1697.69 --> 1702.28
admit what they didn't know either

1698.77 --> 1705.6399999999999
titles basically you know you know

1702.28 --> 1707.29
without sorry the women that phoned that

1705.64 --> 1710.2900000000002
she actually don't have peace and Sandy

1707.29 --> 1712.78
Hook right on that guy the guy that

1710.29 --> 1714.76
investigates Sandy Hook she actually she

1712.78 --> 1718.93
done a documentary oh she was still a

1714.76 --> 1721.0
student stellar student money and she

1718.93 --> 1723.46
done a document we wanna on the Sandy

1721.0 --> 1727.09
Hook whether a rep antique in their meki

1723.46 --> 1729.73
oh the guy helmet somebody on that guy

1727.09 --> 1731.97
that was like all for I can just like he

1729.73 --> 1735.67
done some bleep behind vase to give me

1731.97 --> 1737.65
you know be but what them but they came

1735.67 --> 1740.41
down she actually don't have peace I

1737.65 --> 1744.49
thought wow but I don't think

1740.41 --> 1747.25
Jaylin and they were I bet naive in the

1744.49 --> 1749.71
fact that you know when and would you

1747.25 --> 1751.72
boys jailed and then mentioned that he

1749.71 --> 1753.7
was she got someone if Elmen when he was

1751.72 --> 1757.0
doing the experiment I was that are you

1753.7 --> 1759.13
joking there is 25 people there and not

1757.0 --> 1763.18
one of them thought well only about

1759.13 --> 1765.0700000000002
three balls but 25 people they're never

1763.18 --> 1767.92
even thought oh I'll do about a foeman

1765.07 --> 1769.0
of her filming that to me was that would

1767.92 --> 1771.25
have been the first thing I would have

1769.0 --> 1773.23
done you know I'm gonna fold my so look

1771.25 --> 1775.54
it I saw her getting filmed luckily you

1773.23 --> 1776.01
know documented you can actually make a

1775.54 --> 1779.1
dog

1776.01 --> 1780.5
entry about the dock yeah I don't know

1779.1 --> 1784.56
why they didn't do that

1780.5 --> 1787.86
yeah but we're completely not allowed to

1784.56 --> 1789.48
I don't know no but that's strange

1787.86 --> 1792.12
because they're starring in it they

1789.48 --> 1793.8
shouldn't be bad from having their own

1792.12 --> 1796.11
version no of course not

1793.8 --> 1798.81
and Jim then of course I bought it it

1796.11 --> 1809.1899999999998
might if you had if it is in the

1798.81 --> 1812.25
contract I don't know but yeah this is

1809.19 --> 1813.81
too bad they didn't fill most of it well

1812.25 --> 1815.42
that's [ __ ] that's sure did let's shoot

1813.81 --> 1818.46
the tape of people these aren't they

1815.42 --> 1821.28
here's a scenario play what's happened

1818.46 --> 1822.75
was that jailing dead ask late and I

1821.28 --> 1824.37
believe him when he said it okay can I

1822.75 --> 1825.57
get the copies that they told me so

1824.37 --> 1828.3899999999999
because I would have done the same it's

1825.57 --> 1831.48
a natural thing right and they said yes

1828.39 --> 1834.48
no problems and then they saw the thing

1831.48 --> 1836.1
right right so thank you they can elect

1834.48 --> 1837.8700000000001
telling these people this solder and

1836.1 --> 1840.99
then when Jim said I mean to probably or

1837.87 --> 1843.81
well the contract we need when we sold

1840.99 --> 1845.88
it know they sold after the event they

1843.81 --> 1848.34
made available contract to our guy

1845.88 --> 1850.8600000000001
and then they went back on them so that

1848.34 --> 1852.83
tells me to type a character well look

1850.86 --> 1855.6599999999999
at you know judge a man by the fruits

1852.83 --> 1860.04
that so that tells me the character of

1855.66 --> 1862.2900000000002
these people that's bad isn't hey Arwen

1860.04 --> 1864.44
is it not my friend now that tells you

1862.29 --> 1867.3
exactly what these three people are like

1864.44 --> 1869.01
that's you know they've exposed are that

1867.3 --> 1871.95
inner beings and people seem to forget

1869.01 --> 1873.75
huh just by that simple action I looked

1871.95 --> 1875.88
at I thought we are many they made a

1873.75 --> 1877.59
deal where Jim although he couldn't

1875.88 --> 1880.0200000000002
prove it you know it was it was

1877.59 --> 1881.82
available but available contracts

1880.02 --> 1885.33
available contract and then they denied

1881.82 --> 1887.6699999999998
it you know that tells me the character

1885.33 --> 1889.6499999999999
of these three people that was that was

1887.67 --> 1891.96
shady that was really bad

1889.65 --> 1895.02
you know that was shitty cuz it was

1891.96 --> 1898.19
after they actually sold a they reneged

1895.02 --> 1902.31
on a contract to get a contract proven

1898.19 --> 1905.45
it was all about the money and he got a

1902.31 --> 1905.45
fortune for it Israel

1906.61 --> 1910.029
and that's nice we all look at that you

1908.529 --> 1912.309
are the actions of people you know judge

1910.029 --> 1913.45
a man by his group so Alma and that's

1912.309 --> 1914.019
how I looked at that I thought my

1913.45 --> 1917.049
goodness

1914.019 --> 1921.3700000000001
mommy no one duck jail and imports best

1917.049 --> 1924.1299999999999
thought about that but there you go

1921.37 --> 1926.289
anytime in the documentary them

1924.13 --> 1927.73
admitting that there was things that

1926.289 --> 1929.83
they didn't know or couldn't understand

1927.73 --> 1934.72
and you know like like you said the

1929.83 --> 1936.97
fundamentals like like Einstein's theory

1934.72 --> 1940.72
of relativity you know it's beautiful

1936.97 --> 1946.2
but when you try to put gravity into it

1940.72 --> 1948.73
you know ultimate doesn't int'l

1946.2 --> 1950.919
well that's why you died because you had

1948.73 --> 1952.419
probably the word read of the ether he

1950.919 --> 1956.5
doesn't like that concept or some reason

1952.419 --> 1959.769
I think it was because or so they see or

1956.5 --> 1962.679
whether it's it's perhaps because then

1959.769 --> 1965.169
it would have pointed to an actual

1962.679 --> 1967.3600000000001
everyone had so many implications and so

1965.169 --> 1970.1390000000001
many other theories and beliefs yes

1967.36 --> 1972.07
perhaps religious beliefs which with our

1970.139 --> 1974.59
you know in that with a might be

1972.07 --> 1976.6899999999998
governor good argument oh whatever

1974.59 --> 1979.779
by the way that's not expanding as

1976.69 --> 1982.63
silence it's the universe what we see is

1979.779 --> 1984.34
all that as these lights or not boeing's

1982.63 --> 1986.919
all eight years away you know I mean

1984.34 --> 1989.32
that is what is it was created on

1986.919 --> 1992.8300000000002
purpose and I think maybe that's why and

1989.32 --> 1994.36
then then he brought out that theory and

1992.83 --> 1997.9289999999999
I think it is only because he had

1994.36 --> 2000.9289999999999
problems with Mercury's orbit and into

1997.929 --> 2003.539
some mad orbit in spending Venus is real

2000.929 --> 2006.1490000000001
Venus is another strange a plan actually

2003.539 --> 2008.429
off say is well you know it and then

2006.149 --> 2011.1
you've got I think it's earliness its

2008.429 --> 2012.8090000000002
actual its pose or face and the Sun came

2011.1 --> 2015.1789999999999
in so it's pens room like now since that

2012.809 --> 2017.9089999999999
only that is one of the planets

2015.179 --> 2019.6490000000001
something what okay yeah yeah yeah what

2017.909 --> 2022.7990000000002
are the planks thanks this one is it's

2019.649 --> 2025.62
actually points and it rotates towards

2022.799 --> 2028.799
that direction on on the that plane on

2025.62 --> 2030.2689999999998
that axis instead of my acting okay yeah

2028.799 --> 2032.25
my it's all good stuff

2030.269 --> 2034.529
I love science I've told you about

2032.25 --> 2037.86
that's when I've talked to these boss I

2034.529 --> 2039.48
can I can ask a question and a new exact

2037.86 --> 2041.639
honestly I mean and they say when I say

2039.48 --> 2043.619
I've been in size since I was a kid I

2041.639 --> 2046.11
was any sense as I can read everything

2043.619 --> 2048.48
about it every news theory or everything

2046.11 --> 2052.139
nickiemoore the new star and blah blah

2048.48 --> 2054.809
all my life man all my life

2052.139 --> 2058.319
right I can I can understand I mean the

2054.809 --> 2059.8790000000004
value of a a what quantum physics and I

2058.319 --> 2062.46
mean the quantum physics in three

2059.879 --> 2064.71
minutes and I've done the video and then

2062.46 --> 2066.54
I asked that I described my video to a

2064.71 --> 2069.299
ball ever a guy that's rating these

2066.54 --> 2071.46
stars and stuff like I knew stuff and I

2069.299 --> 2073.379
explained my video and I said this is

2071.46 --> 2076.53
how I described corden physics and I

2073.379 --> 2078.5
explained them and he goes perfect this

2076.53 --> 2080.46
is that so he said you've got it exactly

2078.5 --> 2082.799
everyone else and that was in three

2080.46 --> 2085.29
minutes on would you know it was it was

2082.799 --> 2088.049
funny huh I should do it again cuz cuz I

2085.29 --> 2090.839
got I got some really mind the call me

2088.049 --> 2092.429
Samoa cuz that because it was click be

2090.839 --> 2094.74
you know quantum physics in three

2092.429 --> 2096.75
minutes you might got loads a hex but I

2094.74 --> 2100.589
deleted the video that was like a young

2096.75 --> 2103.71
a half ago it was quite funny and it was

2100.589 --> 2106.98
I got the stamp of approval from one of

2103.71 --> 2109.7400000000002
the old experience you know I mean but I

2106.98 --> 2112.98
got some I'm ain't no abuse over you

2109.74 --> 2115.5
know it's just probability probability

2112.98 --> 2118.14
just remember that quarter physics is

2115.5 --> 2119.01
all about the probability of an event

2118.14 --> 2122.19
happening

2119.01 --> 2126.44
plus the confidence that they've got in

2122.19 --> 2129.18
that probability being right probably

2126.44 --> 2130.65
not saying us me that's that's what

2129.18 --> 2135.72
immense then I recorded them as possible

2130.65 --> 2139.01
yeah thanks yeah it doesn't exist it's a

2135.72 --> 2142.0989999999997
lotta crap no yeah it's it's saying it's

2139.01 --> 2145.5
yep looking at tea leaves literally

2142.099 --> 2148.1600000000003
cyclotron results yeah bunch of lines on

2145.5 --> 2151.319
the paper and then what does this mean

2148.16 --> 2153.3289999999997
kalle elves couple of layers and couple

2151.319 --> 2156.63
lines and we look there's bills in

2153.329 --> 2160.319
universe a none equation helped us a all

2156.63 --> 2162.7200000000003
kind you know and when they see when the

2160.319 --> 2166.619
a I got are still not be or do you know

2162.72 --> 2168.6099999999997
what the the equation for a while I see

2166.619 --> 2172.0
the wood

2168.61 --> 2173.71
or for example their creation for

2172.0 --> 2176.83
perspective ordained say do you know

2173.71 --> 2178.69
they are crazy I said by all we need to

2176.83 --> 2180.85
know the equation if I want you solve a

2178.69 --> 2183.19
problem or do an experiment

2180.85 --> 2185.95
otherwise I'm explaining politics claims

2183.19 --> 2187.7200000000003
for that as importantly about it doesn't

2185.95 --> 2191.02
matter with our new what the numbers the

2187.72 --> 2193.7799999999997
numbers are just a form of language

2191.02 --> 2196.0
which you can describe in English and

2193.78 --> 2199.63
when they describe for the formula does

2196.0 --> 2202.09
in English come on man it's ridiculous

2199.63 --> 2204.28
that's what you said it's certainly

2202.09 --> 2207.82
Vinci leaves and stuff away like stupid

2204.28 --> 2210.3100000000004
yeah you know it would be entry I don't

2207.82 --> 2213.52
know like they might be getting some

2210.31 --> 2215.95
interesting stuff out of it what I think

2213.52 --> 2219.25
that they are like science fictional

2215.95 --> 2222.58
izing it to make it more interesting to

2219.25 --> 2224.89
keep the funding to keep a promise of

2222.58 --> 2226.5699999999997
all there's so much more we can find out

2224.89 --> 2232.15
while they fear they know there's

2226.57 --> 2235.51
there's no no it's not so they made an

2232.15 --> 2237.4900000000002
into a circus show into a like wow look

2235.51 --> 2240.61
what we got in this secret place

2237.49 --> 2242.89
well extraordinary and they the

2240.61 --> 2246.15
astronomy there's a great book deal it's

2242.89 --> 2249.2999999999997
called the history of astronomy as

2246.15 --> 2251.77
reckoning eighteen hundred and some bag

2249.3 --> 2253.48
absolute Greek but it goes right back to

2251.77 --> 2255.22
the times and it tells you about all the

2253.48 --> 2258.73
productions where the moonless night air

2255.22 --> 2260.56
their eclipses the stars movement

2258.73 --> 2264.85
everything everything it was all a

2260.56 --> 2267.07
resort downing tablets ingrained in

2264.85 --> 2268.8399999999997
stone in Babylonian the Chaldeans or

2267.07 --> 2272.0800000000004
whatever yeah they've already done that

2268.84 --> 2274.84
and they aren't the history of less

2272.08 --> 2277.5099999999998
astrophysics or astronomy or whatever

2274.84 --> 2278.98
they were high priests they were wet

2277.51 --> 2280.9
stop those man me but the guys that

2278.98 --> 2282.16
looked at the Stars went to the king and

2280.9 --> 2284.29
said he by the reason us is really

2282.16 --> 2285.97
harmed they look at me

2284.29 --> 2288.64
that's all they will and that's all the

2285.97 --> 2292.1499999999996
RTD they're just tiny priests spoke

2288.64 --> 2293.8599999999997
rubbish but they've lost that a that EF

2292.15 --> 2296.38
to the king no they're just getting used

2293.86 --> 2300.4900000000002
they're just given money to spoke crap

2296.38 --> 2302.109
by the elite elites to hide the truth

2300.49 --> 2303.49
yeah and I think we're oblivious there's

2302.109 --> 2305.65
only a couple of these scientists

2303.49 --> 2308.9799999999996
actually know that are spoken to a

2305.65 --> 2310.9
spoken clap and no no they hate and

2308.98 --> 2314.23
stuff these theoretical anyway I'm not

2310.9 --> 2316.2400000000002
about problem signs but theoretical it's

2314.23 --> 2318.099
basically astrophysics moon no chance

2316.24 --> 2320.6499999999996
not having a assumption after my

2318.099 --> 2322.81
assumption imagine or there soon more or

2320.65 --> 2325.42
less only can home but they're taught

2322.81 --> 2327.82
that they're supposed to do that yeah

2325.42 --> 2331.1800000000003
exactly getting capped from them that

2327.82 --> 2333.9100000000003
yep that is actually the notional it's a

2331.18 --> 2336.0699999999997
controlled illusion yeah and you see

2333.91 --> 2340.359
even ballers approaching flat earthers

2336.07 --> 2342.79
just wheeled this method by default and

2340.359 --> 2346.33
they don't even know it even if you tell

2342.79 --> 2350.17
them even if you describe it as they do

2346.33 --> 2352.47
it they don't they don't just they can't

2350.17 --> 2354.94
see it no this is great

2352.47 --> 2358.75
yeah it's lateness doesn't there's a

2354.94 --> 2361.75
little way and a I don't know a bug or

2358.75 --> 2364.06
anchor let's be and the other that's I'm

2361.75 --> 2366.64
simplifying anybody that talks about

2364.06 --> 2369.04
what about a not believing in reality

2366.64 --> 2370.8689999999997
just start calling them [ __ ] start

2369.04 --> 2373.27
chugging those are traigo who and

2370.869 --> 2375.88
because they all react is seen right or

2373.27 --> 2379.42
just bypass it rattle biting master the

2375.88 --> 2382.349
main strategy just just step over it

2379.42 --> 2386.23
keep on talking about something else

2382.349 --> 2390.88
deflect away you know that's what they

2386.23 --> 2394.69
do now just cursing just even highlights

2390.88 --> 2396.099
it even more so and it's fun to watch

2394.69 --> 2398.05
how much less will I get my

2396.099 --> 2400.3590000000004
entertainment I wish I wish I could be

2398.05 --> 2401.98
bowl of making videos like I used to be

2400.359 --> 2404.2599999999998
quite a lot of videos of it or five

2401.98 --> 2406.72
years ago I wish I could be boiled meat

2404.26 --> 2409.0600000000004
venues in but to see some of the the

2406.72 --> 2410.859
lines that you can get these people you

2409.06 --> 2412.06
see I get home to see all sorts a club

2410.859 --> 2412.42
because I'm really answer they're going

2412.06 --> 2415.42
together

2412.42 --> 2418.96
did you see the brand I yesterday on the

2415.42 --> 2423.2400000000002
debates so I'm totally spiraling into

2418.96 --> 2426.73
madness where she flip flop around and

2423.24 --> 2429.339
then like like completely switched side

2426.73 --> 2430.72
of the argument and then when confronted

2429.339 --> 2433.96
to it just deny it

2430.72 --> 2436.5699999999997
and switch back again that kind of [ __ ]

2433.96 --> 2439.9
multiple times until she like literally

2436.57 --> 2442.51
got confused from switching around she

2439.9 --> 2444.4900000000002
was like wow what's going on she even

2442.51 --> 2447.21
said it like I hey I'm getting a bit

2444.49 --> 2449.56
confused a [ __ ]

2447.21 --> 2451.9900000000002
yep well that's one scene because she

2449.56 --> 2455.619
was like it just sounds like to know

2451.99 --> 2457.8999999999996
when I'm having a chant where maybe a

2455.619 --> 2460.3900000000003
ball Ethel's or Evelyn and I see some

2457.9 --> 2462.4900000000002
family course Stephen or why did the way

2460.39 --> 2464.89
this thing and the answer that I get

2462.49 --> 2467.2
back asleep it's like give me the

2464.89 --> 2467.77
optimum sales they have no clue what I'm

2467.2 --> 2469.6899999999996
talking about

2467.77 --> 2471.31
I know and will they answer most

2469.69 --> 2473.65
questions that I'm asking these balls

2471.31 --> 2476.22
and all the answer to and I know that

2473.65 --> 2478.54
the Scientific Council to so quickly are

2476.22 --> 2480.2799999999997
repeating back a lot I guess Gallup and

2478.54 --> 2483.58
the majority of them do they just meet

2480.28 --> 2487.15
crap oh they may honestly that is it

2483.58 --> 2490.83
they make the muslin improvise yeah

2487.15 --> 2493.63
amplify is answer yo do it pretty well

2490.83 --> 2495.5099999999998
nobody do actually they're good at

2493.63 --> 2500.01
improvising it's a leaders who work if

2495.51 --> 2502.78
improvisation it's like a fantasy

2500.01 --> 2505.8100000000004
building your it's it's like what

2502.78 --> 2507.7900000000004
children can do when they oxygen stuff

2505.81 --> 2510.4
and they're very trained netted and

2507.79 --> 2512.849
there goes domination there they're like

2510.4 --> 2515.6800000000003
it's a part of what they do and they're

2512.849 --> 2518.8900000000003
doing it all of them yeah and they

2515.68 --> 2520.66
matter as they do it it's a sport it's

2518.89 --> 2522.7
like not you know it's not just worry

2520.66 --> 2526.54
I'm not you know thing yeah right just

2522.7 --> 2527.89
natural just but to hear that somebody

2526.54 --> 2530.67
isn't you know what to me on what

2527.89 --> 2533.14
happened this is what yeah well I'm

2530.67 --> 2535.81
fascinating I've always been interested

2533.14 --> 2539.3689999999997
in psychology and stuff like that so I'm

2535.81 --> 2541.599
I'm more than a psychological aspect uh

2539.369 --> 2544.21
that's I thought I was getting triggered

2541.599 --> 2546.9100000000003
I was suing here we're lab the name yeah

2544.21 --> 2548.38
I'm happy it's flat I don't know I'm not

2546.91 --> 2551.5
trying to convince anybody new

2548.38 --> 2552.9700000000003
I'm happy know what I do know is or what

2551.5 --> 2554.859
I like to do now huh great what am I

2552.97 --> 2557.64
gonna do now on which flight I'll stay

2554.859 --> 2559.9
around and let's watch these clones

2557.64 --> 2562.66
try to get out of things that's when I

2559.9 --> 2563.92
fainted comedy mopping me namiko the

2562.66 --> 2567.16
motions like

2563.92 --> 2569.7690000000002
you say Billy me : Oh stupid like and

2567.16 --> 2573.7889999999998
the most stupid answers and and you love

2569.769 --> 2577.1499999999996
God man please thought sometimes you

2573.789 --> 2579.6090000000004
really still it's just meant as a lower

2577.15 --> 2582.359
quality red herring to get away from the

2579.609 --> 2586.15
arguments and then among each other

2582.359 --> 2589.359
that'll be accepted yeah and that's

2586.15 --> 2591.64
their that's bitter on each of their not

2589.359 --> 2594.5789999999997
that tenacious on each other cuz they're

2591.64 --> 2597.069
on each other side but yeah we don't do

2594.579 --> 2598.559
that we actually do point out when it's

2597.069 --> 2601.21
sloppy

2598.559 --> 2602.9500000000003
well I'll feign to be a more genuine

2601.21 --> 2604.48
Arwen okay you know why the fact is

2602.95 --> 2606.73
people were complaining about us I

2604.48 --> 2608.529
remember people complaining about us

2606.73 --> 2612.039
enough I think I maybe complain once

2608.529 --> 2614.829
years ago about it all the baller seemed

2612.039 --> 2617.71
to be together right they all I'd leave

2614.829 --> 2619.869
each other right and fly offers as we

2617.71 --> 2621.369
know like myself and everybody's got a

2619.869 --> 2623.5
better plan you know more not flayed

2621.369 --> 2625.9300000000003
gone though I'm not flaking the voice

2623.5 --> 2627.789
mapping I don't care make a sticky they

2625.93 --> 2630.16
vacuum any [ __ ] I don't one oh she's not

2627.789 --> 2631.8390000000004
a way being a community that's supposed

2630.16 --> 2634.24
to be feel like crying thank you sir

2631.839 --> 2635.95
nobody except max I echo thanking I know

2634.24 --> 2638.2889999999998
you have your clique who stay like that

2635.95 --> 2640.93
good thing but the ball is he stick

2638.289 --> 2643.4500000000003
together right and that's deception

2640.93 --> 2644.89
because it's impossible for everybody to

2643.45 --> 2648.64
leave everybody so they'll actually

2644.89 --> 2651.069
lying to themselves they're more and in

2648.64 --> 2652.71
the more worried about getting flung out

2651.069 --> 2655.599
you know and that's T is thing that

2652.71 --> 2657.339
normal human thing won't go where they

2655.599 --> 2658.809
can go along with a consensus kind of

2657.339 --> 2661.839
thing or they don't they won't you be

2658.809 --> 2663.8190000000004
part of a group we are not because how

2661.839 --> 2666.22
many different groups are flyer foes are

2663.819 --> 2668.079
those like words are definitely we don't

2666.22 --> 2670.18
agree with each other and Milan giving

2668.079 --> 2673.38
it stuff to me that's more honest

2670.18 --> 2676.5989999999997
because at the core the core belief as

2673.38 --> 2678.73
science is lying about real bill 11 and

2676.599 --> 2680.7400000000002
we see we experience what it was flat

2678.73 --> 2682.66
that is what every single flying up or

2680.74 --> 2684.1899999999996
not every person can agree forget about

2682.66 --> 2686.109
the end tree KISSING is the shape of it

2684.19 --> 2689.2000000000003
and stuff but the point is we all agree

2686.109 --> 2691.299
is flat but me we are honest in the way

2689.2 --> 2693.16
that we argue for each other or

2691.299 --> 2694.46
say I that you know that kind of thing

2693.16 --> 2697.0699999999997
that balls very

2694.46 --> 2699.29
really and that's impossible it's just

2697.07 --> 2700.13
not human nature for everybody T ugly

2699.29 --> 2706.06
ain't nothing

2700.13 --> 2710.08
so does so they'll actually be strapped

2706.06 --> 2714.74
sorry they have a pecking order

2710.08 --> 2718.69
yeah to keep one another in line yeah I

2714.74 --> 2722.75
hope to grill each other to go further

2718.69 --> 2725.359
and eventually uh and yes our group like

2722.75 --> 2727.52
become more devious but it's a pecking

2725.359 --> 2731.48
order effect that's what's pushing them

2727.52 --> 2734.5099999999998
to become more devious yet of crap at

2731.48 --> 2736.67
your really binds you know you know as

2734.51 --> 2739.6400000000003
the see I'm I'm watching this so I think

2736.67 --> 2741.369
they're not that bad at it but the

2739.64 --> 2744.2799999999997
problem is we're just better

2741.369 --> 2747.56
yeah that's we can't chop really quick

2744.28 --> 2749.5400000000004
we read those are our skills and gain

2747.56 --> 2752.7799999999997
new knowledge in the process and they

2749.54 --> 2755.48
don't because they're not really gaining

2752.78 --> 2760.07
new knowledge they just gain some new

2755.48 --> 2762.02
trickery that's it you know I said I

2760.07 --> 2764.32
think Sally ladies X lighten ourself

2762.02 --> 2767.06
this even on company

2764.32 --> 2768.8900000000003
Ashley restore never last you me well I

2767.06 --> 2771.2
never find it well I actually brought

2768.89 --> 2774.3799999999997
you a new flyer for did we speak about

2771.2 --> 2776.45
this before oh boy now we haven't talked

2774.38 --> 2779.6600000000003
about it no I actually brought you all

2776.45 --> 2780.08
are today that the light side of the

2779.66 --> 2786.8489999999997
woods

2780.08 --> 2786.8489999999997
shall we see well

2789.38 --> 2799.819
well when you make toast right yeah big

2793.68 --> 2805.319
toast and you spread you spread it's

2799.819 --> 2806.91
always flat right yeah well in the Quran

2805.319 --> 2810.15
which I believe is an immovable

2806.91 --> 2816.96
scripture it says after that he spread

2810.15 --> 2818.849
the earth yeah yesterday and it's the no

2816.96 --> 2822.15
removable scripture and there's no

2818.849 --> 2827.6400000000003
matter which translation I go to it

2822.15 --> 2831.349
keeps it keeps saying you know spreading

2827.64 --> 2834.42
the earth you know and it's only newly

2831.349 --> 2837.9
you know after there's no they did try

2834.42 --> 2844.92
to say that he made it an egg you know

2837.9 --> 2848.25
so to me to me it's like that's the only

2844.92 --> 2850.289
reference I can but I can have but

2848.25 --> 2852.509
whenever I spread something or buy

2850.289 --> 2855.5690000000004
another translation after that he

2852.509 --> 2858.779
stretched you know straight pitching

2855.569 --> 2863.39
something as always across yeah exactly

2858.779 --> 2863.39
but I just put a I just I just put a

2863.509 --> 2879.359
link in the letter S chant then I know

2875.91 --> 2882.48
the shape of the universe you know they

2879.359 --> 2888.299
don't know you know even used in the

2882.48 --> 2892.109
example and everything they stayed in

2888.299 --> 2894.259
their matches like for example torn

2892.109 --> 2894.259
asunder

2896.89 --> 2906.2599999999998
then we toured asunder and then he's

2904.36 --> 2912.05
expanding it you know all of these

2906.26 --> 2914.5400000000004
things and then you get you get just

2912.05 --> 2917.03
when it gets to like what's like what's

2914.54 --> 2920.0299999999997
this what's that it's always these and I

2917.03 --> 2924.98
know it's not it's not answered you know

2920.03 --> 2931.28
what I mean in it yeah lead to it yeah

2924.98 --> 2931.76
it's just me it's the questions you not

2931.28 --> 2934.25
I mean

2931.76 --> 2937.5200000000004
and it's always easy to call someone

2934.25 --> 2944.09
crazy or stupid but that's like that's

2937.52 --> 2947.39
dismissive you know I mean and I don't I

2944.09 --> 2951.4
don't know I don't I don't enjoy that

2947.39 --> 2955.19
label what I'd enjoy I don't enjoy that

2951.4 --> 2958.25
writing off you not I mean because true

2955.19 --> 2960.56
science is questioning science always

2958.25 --> 2963.32
you know and if if they don't have the

2960.56 --> 2969.5
answer then who are they to be the

2963.32 --> 2971.3900000000003
authority you know so and it's only as

2969.5 --> 2976.1
technology develops that we understand

2971.39 --> 2979.52
but there's not one part of the Quran

2976.1 --> 2983.87
that I've been able to falsify you see

2979.52 --> 2986.39
and because I I deal with scripture that

2983.87 --> 2988.04
that verse is very important to me he

2986.39 --> 2993.71
spread the earth he stretched the earth

2988.04 --> 2998.0
to expand the earth it doesn't ever say

2993.71 --> 3000.39
you know just clear as day made of the

2998.0 --> 3003.31
globe you know what he stretched around

3000.39 --> 3005.2599999999998
it never said you stretched around you

3003.31 --> 3007.81
would expect that our owns wouldn't yeah

3005.26 --> 3010.9
if it wasn't a stretch it you know

3007.81 --> 3014.2599999999998
stretching is what you see it's actually

3010.9 --> 3017.89
something like every run yeah exactly

3014.26 --> 3021.19
yes kind of a drum exactly exactly

3017.89 --> 3023.41
and then these and then in this in the

3021.19 --> 3026.11
in the documentary I posted you it's

3023.41 --> 3028.39
quite funny because I fell asleep with

3026.11 --> 3031.119
my youtube on autoplay

3028.39 --> 3033.489
you know and when and when I when I woke

3031.119 --> 3035.349
up it was like thirty minutes into this

3033.489 --> 3037.9
documentary talking about like we don't

3035.349 --> 3039.9700000000003
know you know we know about the universe

3037.9 --> 3041.71
we don't know about the shape of it it

3039.97 --> 3045.279
could be a flat plane it could be a

3041.71 --> 3047.289
infinite saddle shape but could you know

3045.279 --> 3051.999
what I mean it could be it because they

3047.289 --> 3053.44
don't know and so I found that honest

3051.999 --> 3055.1189999999997
that they could admit they don't know

3053.44 --> 3056.799
and it's it's the mathematics that they

3055.119 --> 3058.6600000000003
can't you know what I mean it's and

3056.799 --> 3060.809
that's where the the theory of

3058.66 --> 3065.16
relativity doesn't fit into the quantum

3060.809 --> 3068.44
theory because the mathematics kids

3065.16 --> 3069.8799999999997
because they can do all the they can do

3068.44 --> 3073.39
all the quarks and all the rest of it

3069.88 --> 3076.239
but then they have to assign gravity and

3073.39 --> 3078.609
the way it would twist and Bend

3076.239 --> 3082.809
space-time at the same time in this too

3078.609 --> 3086.38
many calculations possible so yeah you

3082.809 --> 3091.329
know and on top of that they can't

3086.38 --> 3094.42
explain consciousness so it's it you

3091.329 --> 3098.4990000000003
know it's like the yeah it's yeah it's

3094.42 --> 3099.94
it's a to say they know and to say

3098.499 --> 3101.47
there's no other ants there is an

3099.94 --> 3104.44
impossible than this they know

3101.47 --> 3107.019
everything you know and so the questions

3104.44 --> 3109.39
and the need to just silence people who

3107.019 --> 3111.3689999999997
think you know and it's all coming from

3109.39 --> 3114.489
people who don't believe in God so I

3111.369 --> 3117.099
exact that with a red flag I think that

3114.489 --> 3118.989
was a red flag you know if you're open

3117.099 --> 3120.94
to the creator that's one thing you know

3118.989 --> 3122.89
that's keeping the door open but just

3120.94 --> 3126.67
shutting it off that's all stupid blower

3122.89 --> 3128.3799999999997
blades that's the engine that's that's

3126.67 --> 3131.079
easiest because that's that's that's uh

3128.38 --> 3133.089
that's boxed and thought and as you see

3131.079 --> 3134.8590000000004
Jeff killer you know what yeah yeah

3133.089 --> 3136.869
that's a dangerous path to go down

3134.859 --> 3138.91
he's other exactly what you said you

3136.869 --> 3140.319
know he's only what you say there's

3138.91 --> 3142.3289999999997
something to his path listen do not

3140.319 --> 3144.489
really you just see nah never impossible

3142.329 --> 3144.9700000000003
that's not science that's not clinical

3144.489 --> 3147.4
thank you

3144.97 --> 3148.9599999999996
anything's possible unless you find out

3147.4 --> 3151.059
for a fact for the truth

3148.96 --> 3153.73
they've ever enough thank them no that's

3151.059 --> 3157.799
it I've really funny that you know then

3153.73 --> 3160.839
is it anything else yeah yeah

3157.799 --> 3164.16
exactly and if there's any change

3160.839 --> 3167.0789999999997
everybody would change no go to sunny

3164.16 --> 3169.029
look if the consensus of what it is

3167.079 --> 3171.4
changed then everybody would be like oh

3169.029 --> 3172.509
that's what it is it's that sense you

3171.4 --> 3174.19
know what I mean and everybody would be

3172.509 --> 3177.069
like now that's what it is you know what

3174.19 --> 3181.69
I mean so the idea that we know exactly

3177.069 --> 3184.749
what it is you know it's just it's it's

3181.69 --> 3186.759
creating a comfort bubble you know and

3184.749 --> 3189.249
it's just like oh now I can forget about

3186.759 --> 3190.809
that you know what I mean and the wonder

3189.249 --> 3193.779
that you know what is the void of space

3190.809 --> 3197.67
and all the rest of it there's no true

3193.779 --> 3200.259
answer you know we can we can do

3197.67 --> 3205.7490000000003
observations from here but with limited

3200.259 --> 3214.15
you know what I mean so I think don't

3205.749 --> 3219.39
dismiss anything that's in the jury's

3214.15 --> 3222.94
still out and it you can't you can't

3219.39 --> 3224.3799999999997
venture TVs you know back choppy reefs

3222.94 --> 3226.599
yeah that kind of explains your camera

3224.38 --> 3229.539
ok switch a camera off me

3226.599 --> 3232.299
nothing damn it you know maybe switch

3229.539 --> 3237.6400000000003
your carry-on yeah you know it's you so

3232.299 --> 3242.349
you'd be verified yeah they're taking us

3237.64 --> 3244.8289999999997
that's really yeah so low bandwidth for

3242.349 --> 3244.829
a moment

3244.95 --> 3251.2599999999998
yeah it's it's yes it's been a strange

3248.98 --> 3253.42
one today with my internet last couple

3251.26 --> 3256.69
of days as well they just it's not you

3253.42 --> 3267.79
know it's weird trying to join Scott it

3256.69 --> 3270.67
cuts me off having to restart my oh god

3267.79 --> 3272.44
I hope it's not me no no it's not you

3270.67 --> 3275.2000000000003
it's not you and I can hear you loud and

3272.44 --> 3280.3
clear me okay yeah a father coming

3275.2 --> 3282.3289999999997
through all cages yeah thinking up and

3280.3 --> 3286.3
down

3282.329 --> 3289.329
but you know I think I think the fact

3286.3 --> 3293.9500000000003
that they can admit you know what I mean

3289.329 --> 3296.6800000000003
like the world could be warping we don't

3293.95 --> 3299.6499999999996
even know you know we just don't we just

3296.68 --> 3304.93
don't know any and looping yeah whooping

3299.65 --> 3308.589
oh no no yeah no no look just why not

3304.93 --> 3311.1699999999996
special looping why not yeah yeah we

3308.589 --> 3313.089
don't know yeah non dog but we could

3311.17 --> 3316.42
actually find out that's the funny thing

3313.089 --> 3319.42
about it yeah

3316.42 --> 3321.46
hey wobble Alex wants to know hey Arwen

3319.42 --> 3323.7400000000002
Herbert lost her about you raped her hey

3321.46 --> 3325.839
Alex Georgia see hey do you know how you

3323.74 --> 3328.6899999999996
said you would fund Eddie Bravo

3325.839 --> 3331.27
I remember us cuz I'll tell you what if

3328.69 --> 3333.119
he was gonna do that I'd be first on me

3331.27 --> 3335.65
on me I'd love to good night

3333.119 --> 3337.809
so you should rate Alex Jordan see right

3335.65 --> 3340.6600000000003
fund us nevermind funding Eddie Bravo

3337.809 --> 3343.5400000000004
[ __ ] knows it is cool but you have to

3340.66 --> 3347.2799999999997
keep in mind that that was a guy wearing

3343.54 --> 3347.2799999999997
a NASA shirt telling him

3348.24 --> 3359.97
so yeah but yeah it's it was it was no

3353.53 --> 3359.9700000000003
way Eddie he's chew up your game brother

3360.18 --> 3363.18
man

3363.45 --> 3368.14
that's a bit weird

3365.04 --> 3370.9
okay so what'd you think Alex Jones in

3368.14 --> 3373.93
Arwen but your jacket way I don't go

3370.9 --> 3375.76
after it and I don't go with the flu

3373.93 --> 3377.2599999999998
shell thing right but what was your

3375.76 --> 3378.94
opinion could you watch him a lot of

3377.26 --> 3381.28
input would you there can jus late knees

3378.94 --> 3385.0
on the up and up or whatever

3381.28 --> 3386.94
open up I mean yeah I am meaning he's

3385.0 --> 3389.02
been honest up and up and just means

3386.94 --> 3391.15
being honest if he's on the up-and-up

3389.02 --> 3396.97
that means yeah you're being genuine

3391.15 --> 3401.4700000000003
honest yes and no he is up and up

3396.97 --> 3406.2999999999997
absolutely like frontline honesty but he

3401.47 --> 3409.6899999999996
is also stuck in contracts and in forced

3406.3 --> 3414.01
deception methodology and he is a master

3409.69 --> 3420.369
at it and he is an open book for those

3414.01 --> 3423.4
who know how to read him that's it you

3420.369 --> 3425.9100000000003
know yeah I've known him for seven years

3423.4 --> 3428.38
now I've lost on Buddha Crossing

3425.91 --> 3430.359
everybody and I couldn't Billy I don't

3428.38 --> 3433.03
know I just came up on one of my feet no

3430.359 --> 3437.109
yes guy and I washed and then he was

3433.03 --> 3440.619
screaming about the elites also yeah

3437.109 --> 3442.27
exactly that's what I do yeah and then

3440.619 --> 3444.339
why are we doin this is that's just

3442.27 --> 3446.349
that's just the thing is anything that

3444.339 --> 3448.7999999999997
he said if you say the dog came I would

3446.349 --> 3451.329
always go and check and I wouldn't check

3448.8 --> 3453.52
check that document and then check the

3451.329 --> 3456.52
dog him and just checked to go really

3453.52 --> 3459.25
deep on him and I'm telling it most of

3456.52 --> 3461.92
us I mean like 99% in this stuff day

3459.25 --> 3463.48
that I looked at me they he gave me and

3461.92 --> 3466.06
I mean like he gives her hundreds of

3463.48 --> 3469.72
stuff and I've investigate or trying to

3466.06 --> 3473.0499999999997
verify as much as I could like hundreds

3469.72 --> 3475.18
are things he said our documents and the

3473.05 --> 3476.7000000000003
organ donor ordeal that all yeah it's

3475.18 --> 3480.569
not like he's lying

3476.7 --> 3483.45
the nobody doesn't lie about those

3480.569 --> 3485.94
things except sometimes by accident and

3483.45 --> 3489.6899999999996
then he tries to correct it what he does

3485.94 --> 3494.059
do however is sometimes overdo it a bit

3489.69 --> 3498.18
on the unification of the connections

3494.059 --> 3501.5690000000004
but it's but it's very hard to tell it's

3498.18 --> 3505.109
very and maybe even for himself that he

3501.569 --> 3508.2599999999998
sometimes just makes a tiny jump to

3505.109 --> 3511.98
conclusion for a politicization reason

3508.26 --> 3514.6800000000003
or for just because that's what he

3511.98 --> 3517.53
stands behind and he wants his freaking

3514.68 --> 3521.3689999999997
foot on the gas pedal he's addicted to

3517.53 --> 3525.51
doing that so he must he can't just say

3521.369 --> 3528.299
he can't be too honest and preferred

3525.51 --> 3530.9900000000002
provide a slightly less incoherent story

3528.299 --> 3536.13
so he just chisels it out into this

3530.99 --> 3539.3999999999996
unified statue and then she does your

3536.13 --> 3541.6800000000003
face that's what I was when he was on

3539.4 --> 3544.04
Piers Morgan when he seen on Piers

3541.68 --> 3548.04
Morgan I mean he got so much backlash

3544.04 --> 3550.79
from the Mpho was and he even felt and

3548.04 --> 3553.619
this is what I thought Madeleine about

3550.79 --> 3555.54
your baggage from elevating that you or

3553.619 --> 3557.4900000000002
people were complaining he was showing

3555.54 --> 3559.41
him boring stuff and he even thought

3557.49 --> 3560.7299999999996
that because if because after the

3559.41 --> 3562.859
interview because I watched them of you

3560.73 --> 3564.45
and I and I watched the next thing and

3562.859 --> 3566.819
forceout I used to watch all the tape

3564.45 --> 3570.18
and the next thing and you could tell

3566.819 --> 3572.609
that he was he was a bet he was a bit

3570.18 --> 3574.2
uncalled for than John we see that he

3572.609 --> 3575.73
reacted probably because he said what do

3574.2 --> 3578.25
you guys think of the reactron

3575.73 --> 3581.369
I thought it was amazing Mike I was

3578.25 --> 3583.53
absolutely happy it was that guy was

3581.369 --> 3586.44
genuine there was no way that was acting

3583.53 --> 3590.01
you know I mean absolutely was glorious

3586.44 --> 3591.75
and it was a glorious exactly like it

3590.01 --> 3594.6600000000003
was probably one of the best butts a

3591.75 --> 3596.819
television he took advantage other he

3594.66 --> 3598.589
wave pool at it man yeah you know and

3596.819 --> 3599.67
then you find out how he got treated at

3598.589 --> 3603.63
this studio

3599.67 --> 3604.66
ain't nothing yeah but I thought it was

3603.63 --> 3607.6600000000003
epic yeah yeah

3604.66 --> 3610.18
- absolutely not but as I see I'm not

3607.66 --> 3611.98
cordially like just what you said was

3610.18 --> 3614.56
honestly there but he's under

3611.98 --> 3616.53
contractual obligations and I think

3614.56 --> 3619.24
maybe they're real the reason he doesn't

3616.53 --> 3622.03
talk so much about the Jews now I get it

3619.24 --> 3625.06
because you know my logic would say well

3622.03 --> 3626.92
look I can guarantee you these people

3625.06 --> 3629.59
looking for any excuse at all what

3626.92 --> 3630.9700000000003
somebody close that guy in the human you

3629.59 --> 3632.6200000000003
know they've already proved that we knew

3630.97 --> 3635.5299999999997
to bring he would kick over YouTube and

3632.62 --> 3638.23
all these 12 and stuff wait on you so

3635.53 --> 3644.23
and and it's like you know what I mean

3638.23 --> 3645.61
not constantly trying to like like shot

3644.23 --> 3648.31
him down and that's why I think he

3645.61 --> 3650.73
doesn't cooperate the Jews he realizes I

3648.31 --> 3653.89
can only call this finding his death

3650.73 --> 3655.42
nothing it won't he says right I can

3653.89 --> 3657.31
only go that far because I know for a

3655.42 --> 3659.41
fact I'm winning if I start with muscle

3657.31 --> 3661.15
today I shot me down yeah it's like now

3659.41 --> 3664.06
it's because also because of the

3661.15 --> 3666.37
screaming factor yeah the juice yeah

3664.06 --> 3669.4
yeah if he will end up like screaming

3666.37 --> 3671.98
about that that's gonna break everyone's

3669.4 --> 3673.15
mind yeah yeah that's true that's true

3671.98 --> 3675.61
and I think that's what I'm seeing so

3673.15 --> 3678.01
he's smart in that we are doing it so I

3675.61 --> 3681.28
think and and it can be misconstrued

3678.01 --> 3682.57
this him you know even being a shell

3681.28 --> 3684.7000000000003
because he doesn't talk about it about

3682.57 --> 3686.17
it I've just explained how our largest

3684.7 --> 3688.06
son he's acquiring doesn't talk nothing

3686.17 --> 3689.4700000000003
that's a reasonable a reasonable good

3688.06 --> 3691.48
explanation because that's what I would

3689.47 --> 3693.52
do I would say you know I'm a good

3691.48 --> 3696.46
negate am I going to be keep my station

3693.52 --> 3698.2599999999998
and get as much truth is possible and

3696.46 --> 3701.53
and and forget about let's go people

3698.26 --> 3703.1200000000003
let's talk about less and get less truth

3701.53 --> 3706.03
because this is what I don't need to

3703.12 --> 3708.7
bring name the main in hats or whatever

3706.03 --> 3711.4300000000003
you a con yeah many tiny hats

3708.7 --> 3717.0
yeah wouldn't you watch you and Ben yeah

3711.43 --> 3719.44
yeah I'll leave the other part out yeah

3717.0 --> 3722.65
yeah the man with tiny hats

3719.44 --> 3726.73
yeah what's so funny how he sketched it

3722.65 --> 3727.4500000000003
out like to this evening man like Mark

3726.73 --> 3730.54
Zuckerberg

3727.45 --> 3732.79
being so like a hobbit sitting on a

3730.54 --> 3736.48
chair with extra height it was like Oh

3732.79 --> 3737.67
blue always growing but really actually

3736.48 --> 3740.94
actually seen

3737.67 --> 3747.539
Trisha nonliving we thought it was kind

3740.94 --> 3749.309
of cute Oman we just saw for us now

3747.539 --> 3751.529
because you don't see the size that hate

3749.309 --> 3754.4100000000003
all these people Joe Rogan II's a bit

3751.529 --> 3758.76
fine or something like he's one of these

3754.41 --> 3761.339
small my gosh kings and Alto Tom Cruise

3758.76 --> 3763.559
these are we monsters fine you don't

3761.339 --> 3769.109
crew I've had everybody knows Tom Cruise

3763.559 --> 3773.1600000000003
yeah yeah yeah look at that big either

3769.109 --> 3775.38
okay no I'm fine I'm fine be on a good

3773.16 --> 3778.6499999999996
day when the midden when the moon is

3775.38 --> 3781.349
pulling on me I'm fighting for it but

3778.65 --> 3784.4100000000003
when it's on the other side of the on

3781.349 --> 3788.88
this far away from me is a shrink bag

3784.41 --> 3792.41
back to my knees again okay yes the

3788.88 --> 3797.339
beauty of God that's funny

3792.41 --> 3799.17
saltwater bodies only over six foot if

3797.339 --> 3801.45
the moon's supposed to pull on the salt

3799.17 --> 3803.88
water bodies only then yeah we got salt

3801.45 --> 3807.75
water in ourselves as well oh good point

3803.88 --> 3810.23
actually so there's my theory it comes

3807.75 --> 3813.93
together see how it comes together

3810.23 --> 3816.39
well my observation my observation of

3813.93 --> 3819.3289999999997
the phenomena was my hate changed when

3816.39 --> 3821.759
the moon my expand of wars let's see

3819.329 --> 3823.7400000000002
let's decide walk but I've just hidden

3821.759 --> 3827.46
the you know the scientific method my

3823.74 --> 3828.9599999999996
observation was oh that's rich and hey

3827.46 --> 3830.2200000000003
everything the moon's at our Salem

3828.96 --> 3832.619
Police and when it moves that we are

3830.22 --> 3834.8999999999996
shrink back to normal size I'll repeat

3832.619 --> 3838.92
that phone Dave you've just verified

3834.9 --> 3846.7200000000003
that well I've got a theory night why

3838.92 --> 3849.029
are when I was often doing has been

3846.72 --> 3852.1499999999996
verified by a another flying of

3849.029 --> 3857.13
scientists there all right you you also

3852.15 --> 3860.2200000000003

that the moon exerts gravity on the

3860.22 --> 3862.339
earth

3864.96 --> 3870.7
yeah you could probably probably do that

3867.82 --> 3874.3
mathematically is we also oh dear no

3870.7 --> 3877.89
don't give him any ideas right now you

3874.3 --> 3880.3590000000004

I'm gonna round it out I'm relieved yeah

4000.75 --> 4005.94
I wouldn't have come on so soon but

4003.26 --> 4009.21
dawned rate traitor asked me about my

4005.94 --> 4010.9500000000003
faith and you know I said if he gets on

4009.21 --> 4015.9900000000002
the show first I'll know he's serious

4010.95 --> 4017.9399999999996
and he did so I did but you know it was

4015.99 --> 4022.1699999999996
a good chat yeah indeed no it was very

4017.94 --> 4024.18
to have you yeah I think this is weird

4022.17 --> 4028.079
like there's this chemistry between you

4024.18 --> 4029.6699999999996
and Ally and me is funny like the

4028.079 --> 4033.029
previous time it happened as well like

4029.67 --> 4036.319
keep some flowing really nicely I liked

4033.029 --> 4040.289
it should do that more often I think we

4036.319 --> 4042.5099999999998
yeah I think we're each came to bounce

4040.289 --> 4044.6090000000004
the ideas off each other to see how we

4042.51 --> 4047.5490000000004
react and what we think and I I think we

4044.609 --> 4049.38
both I mean when one person is talking

4047.549 --> 4052.799
the other two are listening you know and

4049.38 --> 4053.579
I think I think that's the key yeah yeah

4052.799 --> 4056.609
good point

4053.579 --> 4059.9300000000003
hmm good point

4056.609 --> 4063.63
yeah two people can talk one can listen

4059.93 --> 4065.8799999999997
build up momentum then the other one a

4063.63 --> 4069.42
conversation rounds out and the new

4065.88 --> 4071.789
momentum picks up and yeah that's kind

4069.42 --> 4074.099
of yeah it's a good dynamic its kind of

4071.789 --> 4076.98
the same thing that the did Joe Rogan

4074.099 --> 4081.0
Alex Jones podcast with Eddie Bravo hat

4076.98 --> 4082.279
I guess also three people yeah yeah it

4081.0 --> 4084.539
