313.22 --> 321.23
so yeah what have I been doing I've been

318.02 --> 322.96999999999997
trying to order the things that I wants

321.23 --> 326.24
to order but it just seems like it's

322.97 --> 328.73
completely impossible like for some

326.24 --> 336.98
reason it's absolutely impossible for me

328.73 --> 339.23
personally yeah to get through on the

336.98 --> 344.63
infowar store I can't call them up on

339.23 --> 348.02000000000004
the phone I can't like the the online

344.63 --> 350.83
ordering system is broken to me on every

348.02 --> 355.28
browser every browser I don't get this

350.83 --> 357.95
it's just not working so weird but other

355.28 --> 361.54999999999995
yeah other people say they don't have a

357.95 --> 364.81
problem with this I've just kind of

361.55 --> 364.81
baffled as to that situation

371.439 --> 379.809
I'm here not at keys good morning okay-y

377.05 --> 384.55
Infowars because they have some really

379.809 --> 389.199
got unique products that's what I do it

384.55 --> 393.039
for I'm not gonna get like all the

389.199 --> 395.019
standard things there but yeah it's just

393.039 --> 398.849
because of the supplements and and the

395.019 --> 402.159
air filter thing which is now really off

398.849 --> 405.68899999999996
like there's a big discount on it I'd be

402.159 --> 408.55
crazy not to order it there but yeah

405.689 --> 415.47900000000004
it's just it doesn't work for some

408.55 --> 419.019
reason okay you can stop copy pasting

415.479 --> 422.61
that same thing now Miss grace yet hey

419.019 --> 422.61
Selita Cosentino hello Neil

430.05 --> 443.97
yeah mmm all right so I it was pretty

439.74 --> 446.55
late yesterday I think no wasn't that

443.97 --> 454.28900000000004
late but for some reason I slept very

446.55 --> 462.99
long do I use adblock no I don't use

454.289 --> 465.69
adblock and yeah I see plenty of ads now

462.99 --> 468.75
it's in the ordering system so for some

465.69 --> 471.479
reason when I go to the shipping part of

468.75 --> 473.31
the ordering process it just breaks not

471.479 --> 477.99
that it even gives an error that's just

473.31 --> 481.08
no wait it it it leads to a dead end you

477.99 --> 482.58
can't continue like ironically you can

481.08 --> 484.289
like the only thing that's available

482.58 --> 488.15
right there is like the donate button

484.289 --> 494.88
you want to donate that's it that's it

488.15 --> 499.53
it feels almost like crab Li I don't

494.88 --> 501.419
know what that is it's just broken and I

499.53 --> 503.909
don't get it and I can't even call them

501.419 --> 506.58
up - oh yeah and they also message them

503.909 --> 510.479
through the special messaging system

506.58 --> 512.7289999999999
just no response I don't I don't even

510.479 --> 521.61
get a confirmation response that they

512.729 --> 524.97
received anything it's so weird almost

521.61 --> 530.87
like there's like a personal IP block on

524.97 --> 530.87
me somehow I don't know from from where

537.83 --> 542.409
[Music]

547.08 --> 552.87
yes Alex is all about the material well

550.32 --> 556.95
look Oh God

552.87 --> 561.48
yeah I know there's so many issues you

556.95 --> 563.37
know but yeah I've been following Alex

561.48 --> 569.4
John for a long time and the products

563.37 --> 572.28
yeah it's like it's almost like you take

569.4 --> 574.3199999999999
his [ __ ] you have to take his

572.28 --> 578.9399999999999
[ __ ] just to get to the supplements

574.32 --> 584.34
that's kind of the setup because they're

578.94 --> 586.7700000000001
that good and that's not yeah that's not

584.34 --> 589.62
me Schilling is me speaking from

586.77 --> 593.46
experience I used his products and

589.62 --> 596.73
shared it on the show like basically did

593.46 --> 599.34
live reviews of it from a very honest

596.73 --> 601.35
perspective and with some background

599.34 --> 603.99
stuff research you know that it's been

601.35 --> 607.32
part of my show even before the Flat

603.99 --> 612.8100000000001
Earth early bird show so yeah I've used

607.32 --> 614.97
it I try to give my own version of like

612.81 --> 619.3499999999999
what I would recommend on how to use it

614.97 --> 621.9
sometimes because I'm always about using

619.35 --> 628.2
it use it use it sparingly whatever it

621.9 --> 631.8299999999999
is pretty much and yeah there are some

628.2 --> 637.83
things that I like it's the only place I

631.83 --> 640.26
know where they have that like iodine

637.83 --> 645.09
nice and iodine like that I don't know

640.26 --> 647.27
any other sources for that never seen

645.09 --> 647.27
them

659.23 --> 667.27
yes yes I can it's called vacation money

664.41 --> 670.87
through the social welfare so their gift

667.27 --> 672.61
they basically held back on the money to

670.87 --> 675.61
give it all to me right now that's just

672.61 --> 685.1800000000001
how they do that so yes I can I've

675.61 --> 689.13
pretty much done that every year no they

685.18 --> 689.13
didn't find lead in his products

695.279 --> 699.689
you're talking about like one of these

697.92 --> 711.66
things from very early on

699.689 --> 716.779
it's what David Weiss has iodine product

711.66 --> 716.779
really Missouri bear are you for real

730.62 --> 741.99
okay so I guess I guess I'm not very

737.01 --> 742.38
updated with the market or something yes

741.99 --> 746.73
mom

742.38 --> 749.85
okay I guess that maybe I should have

746.73 --> 750.36
looked around I'm just a creature of

749.85 --> 754.62
habit

750.36 --> 759.15
mostly it's yeah but hey if you got some

754.62 --> 761.34
tips for me that's fine I'll check it

759.15 --> 764.5699999999999
out but I'm not gonna bite from any

761.34 --> 769.4300000000001
freaking Amazon just to Claire there

764.57 --> 769.4300000000001
yeah yeah yeah yeah

774.72 --> 780.9300000000001
if you got any other source than Amazon

777.24 --> 783.72
you know because I can't say that I like

780.93 --> 786.2299999999999
Amazon more than I do Infowars if you

783.72 --> 786.23
know what I mean

809.42 --> 812.17
so

812.96 --> 820.39
any other or is that it it's just Amazon

827.16 --> 835.86
crow has stuff as well right does he

830.279 --> 838.92
sell iodine if you could link me up just

835.86 --> 841.5500000000001
put the link of these webshop or

838.92 --> 849.449
whatever just put it in the chat

841.55 --> 852.329
you got a wrench just do it a nutrient

849.449 --> 855.62
pack I don't need a pack I want very

852.329 --> 855.62
specific products

867.16 --> 874.17
well outreach man in the Netherlands is

870.51 --> 878.85
it's better than a lot of places but

874.17 --> 883.62
yeah I live a very secluded life and

878.85 --> 885.94
that ya prevents me from spending money

883.62 --> 888.13
because other people on welfare

885.94 --> 890.7600000000001
they don't live like this and they don't

888.13 --> 894.9399999999999
have money for [ __ ] because of it

890.76 --> 898.18
because they are spending it like on

894.94 --> 899.0500000000001
going out and [ __ ] it's very expensive

898.18 --> 903.13
okay

899.05 --> 905.5
I don't specifically is it because well

903.13 --> 908.26
I'm not very good at it and I need like

905.5 --> 911.68
I can't afford that [ __ ] that's why I

908.26 --> 914.88
don't do it because I need the

911.68 --> 918.8199999999999
supplements I prioritize supplements

914.88 --> 924.73
that's my choice and I can barely afford

918.82 --> 927.1800000000001
it okay barely but I still think it's

924.73 --> 927.1800000000001
worth it

932.35 --> 935.479
[Music]

947.49 --> 956.36
right so this whole Google it Google the

952.29 --> 960.5999999999999
product it's it's just Amazon isn't it

956.36 --> 962.91
Amazon has everything but it's probably

960.6 --> 968.3000000000001
one of the ebee evilest corporations in

962.91 --> 974.959
the world right now it's very creepy

968.3 --> 974.959
Bezos is very creepy guy eBay

976.369 --> 985.7900000000001
really there is nascent iodine for sale

981.179 --> 985.79
on eBay sounds extremely trustworthy

997.48 --> 1002.52
okay oh let's see

1033.809 --> 1039.6789999999999
Oh what okay

1044.01 --> 1046.73
huh

1047.53 --> 1059.91
I have no idea there is like Alex Jones

1051.64 --> 1059.91
product even for sale on on the eBay huh

1064.09 --> 1068.83
International hmm

1072.37 --> 1077.6399999999999
okay I might actually try that

1084.44 --> 1092.42
all right there is a lot of shipping

1086.45 --> 1093.46
costs though what's that price is that a

1092.42 --> 1097.75
good price

1093.46 --> 1097.75
let me cross-reference that

1108.73 --> 1119.29
no that's not a good price that's like

1112.5 --> 1121.2
double the price yep

1119.29 --> 1124.2
yeah that's gonna be very expensive

1121.2 --> 1124.2
actually

1129.58 --> 1132.33
all right

1148.16 --> 1157.8000000000002
yeah vitamins well look the overpriced

1152.82 --> 1160.86
vitamins right yeah technically yeah but

1157.8 --> 1164.52
I can tell you from experience from

1160.86 --> 1167.6999999999998
using them that it's a much higher much

1164.52 --> 1170.99
more effective quality of those vitamins

1167.7 --> 1173.73
so it is kind of like a little stuff and

1170.99 --> 1176.25
it is more actually like you know if you

1173.73 --> 1177.45
really need it you can't really pay for

1176.25 --> 1180.06
it it's not like you need Bette

1177.45 --> 1190.55
specifically to survive and it's really

1180.06 --> 1190.55
good quality though yeah yeah what

1202.01 --> 1205.24
okay on a plane

1207.75 --> 1212.19
would be good if you could link me up

1209.58 --> 1215.97
for that but you don't ever wrench look

1212.19 --> 1218.04
let's not I get it I get it I get it I

1215.97 --> 1221.55
should probably look for other sources

1218.04 --> 1223.86
as well it's just that I'm just weirded

1221.55 --> 1225.8999999999999
out that just the info war story and

1223.86 --> 1228.4799999999998
it's still it used to be pretty good you

1225.9 --> 1231.8100000000002
know I've ordered there many times and

1228.48 --> 1234.92
I'm just very satisfied but now it's

1231.81 --> 1239.4199999999998
broken and I don't get it why this is

1234.92 --> 1239.42
it's not gonna look good on them too

1253.19 --> 1255.8500000000001
okay

1259.84 --> 1263.4299999999998

1370.85 --> 1382.79
the same stuff yep but thanks for trying

1382.79 --> 1397.85
well but it's not the same I'm sure it

1397.429 --> 1402.0800000000002
is

1397.85 --> 1404.299
look I can get like kelp tablets it's

1402.08 --> 1407.3899999999999
incredibly cheap you know I can I used

1404.299 --> 1413.59
to use that before yeah it's uh it's

1407.39 --> 1416.6000000000001
okay but that's not the same product as

1413.59 --> 1419.1399999999999
I said so

1416.6 --> 1419.1399999999999
anyway

1438.269 --> 1441.049
hmm

1442.69 --> 1447.729
maybe on the other hand I should I could

1445.389 --> 1453.2189999999998
also just try to make a completely new

1447.729 --> 1457.739
account that info worse and try if it

1453.219 --> 1457.739
then if the same problem persists

1469.37 --> 1478.25
I think what you're scared of eBay

1472.22 --> 1483.38
really well I I you know eBay has a risk

1478.25 --> 1484.79
as risk factors to it but yeah if you

1483.38 --> 1488.5900000000001
think that's worth it then it's probably

1484.79 --> 1488.59
really good in dynamic

1496.49 --> 1503.77
oh nice Road Stanley good to hear

1529.72 --> 1536.3700000000001
to start click ëedití that's not that's

1533.47 --> 1538.96
footage I took from YouTube

1536.37 --> 1543.07
that's not footage that I personally

1538.96 --> 1545.8600000000001
filmed I just took a couple of clips of

1543.07 --> 1551.789
birds that I found randomly on YouTube

1545.86 --> 1554.049
and edited them together so I don't know

1551.789 --> 1556.179
you know those birds are a very

1554.049 --> 1559.299
short-lived I think so I think they're

1556.179 --> 1561.72
probably already ten but yeah what

1559.299 --> 1561.72
should I do

1588.309 --> 1593.71
acaba is still sitting in snow is he

1666.14 --> 1669.179
[Music]

1674.16 --> 1680.1000000000001
all right you have a so like the summer

1676.95 --> 1683.67
for you is almost like a spring break

1680.1 --> 1686.6999999999998
that persists like that it makes sense

1683.67 --> 1690.39
that the summer would just break through

1686.7 --> 1695.46
start melting everything in the period

1690.39 --> 1699.98
of a yeah of a very nice long spring is

1695.46 --> 1699.98
that what it's like you have

1712.65 --> 1715.3700000000001
mm-hm

1732.83 --> 1738.6999999999998
yeah that sucks in Missouri bear yeah

1736.49 --> 1742.61
it's very annoying when you have very

1738.7 --> 1745.73
prolonged periods of rain I know what

1742.61 --> 1748.82
you mean because then like cannabis can

1745.73 --> 1751.63
start to get all fungi tup and all that

1748.82 --> 1751.6299999999999
it's very annoying

1791.97 --> 1798.33
all right yeah Michael work a greenhouse

1795.71 --> 1801.1200000000001
well the problem is is that if there's

1798.33 --> 1804.629
just not enough some greenhouse and

1801.12 --> 1809.9399999999998
houses don't do a lot and unless you

1804.629 --> 1813.33
have like a good system to D humidify it

1809.94 --> 1817.3700000000001
within the greenhouse fungi is still

1813.33 --> 1817.37
gonna just rip through the plants

1827.33 --> 1833.809
but yeah technically yeah if you have

1829.94 --> 1838.159
the the things for it the available room

1833.809 --> 1841.009
and and all that money wise then you

1838.159 --> 1845.8090000000002
could just say okay screw you whether

1841.009 --> 1849.039
I'm just gonna hang Sun lamps growing

1845.809 --> 1851.809
grower Sun lamps in in that greenhouse

1849.039 --> 1853.789
dehumidifier it to proper levels and

1851.809 --> 1859.509
then just grow it like that until the

1853.789 --> 1861.859
Sun comes back I don't know I've never

1859.509 --> 1866.84
personally tried that but that seems

1861.859 --> 1869.9499999999998
like sensible somebody should ask Rasta

1866.84 --> 1873.049
happen he knows everything about that

1869.95 --> 1875.679
everything there is to know about

1873.049 --> 1875.679

1989.48 --> 1999.559
really like um yeah I'm almost like I

1995.57 --> 2003.96
want to get this disorder issue out of

1999.559 --> 2007.6299999999999
the way like it really bugs me that it's

2003.96 --> 2010.929
yeah it doesn't work for no apparently

2007.63 --> 2014.0700000000002
good reason really frustrating me I

2010.929 --> 2014.0700000000002
don't get it

2019.08 --> 2027.9499999999998

2023.759 --> 2033.779
outside working I don't know somebody

2027.95 --> 2037.529
there's like a when you say somebody is

2033.779 --> 2040.68
just doing some working with tools and

[Music]

2063.86 --> 2074.1
yes Missouri bear so yeah think about it

2069.98 --> 2075.84
yeah you need to figure out like if

2074.1 --> 2078.72
they're not getting enough light and

2075.84 --> 2082.26
they stop growing then you have to kind

2078.72 --> 2083.97
of encourage them so are the plants all

2082.26 --> 2089.82
outside or do you have a greenhouse for

2083.97 --> 2092.5499999999997
it because if the sun's not coming out

2089.82 --> 2097.4700000000003
then you yeah you probably should just

2092.55 --> 2100.76
feel them feed them left light for the

2097.47 --> 2100.7599999999998
time being if you have it

2122.97 --> 2139.2
oh whoa acaba that's weird story hmm all

2132.839 --> 2140.67
outside yeah that's a tough one that

2139.2 --> 2144.23
there's a written yeah there you won't

2140.67 --> 2144.23
be able to do anything about it then

[Music]

2151.119 --> 2154.119
ha

2155.54 --> 2161.19
on a plane that happens to some people

2158.49 --> 2164.91
some people just attract mosquitoes and

2161.19 --> 2168.15
others down in a way it's I don't

2164.91 --> 2169.8289999999997
exactly remember what it is but it is

2168.15 --> 2172.5
something about what is in your blood

2169.829 --> 2175.8590000000004
and all that like depending on things

2172.5 --> 2181.079
you eat because I used to attract a lot

2175.859 --> 2185.0989999999997
of mosquitoes when I was younger but now

2181.079 --> 2189.44
yeah they i-i don't repel them entirely

2185.099 --> 2189.44
but i don't seem to attract them as much

2192.02 --> 2197.73
and i've become a very good mosquito

2195.329 --> 2200.4300000000003
hunter it's like i I don't like killing

2197.73 --> 2204.869
any type of creature but mosquitoes are

2200.43 --> 2206.5789999999997
an exception to that like mosquitoes

2204.869 --> 2208.829
that actually bite because there's also

2206.579 --> 2213.51
the type of mosquitoes with long legs

2208.829 --> 2217.38
and they're they're actually yeah they

2213.51 --> 2220.92
don't bite they're just blue they get in

2217.38 --> 2222.4500000000003
the way but they're not bad creatures so

2220.92 --> 2224.359
if they're like really big with long

2222.45 --> 2229.29
legs and everything they're not really

2224.359 --> 2231.74
the the sucky type of mosquitoes I leave

2229.29 --> 2231.74
them alone

2238.779 --> 2241.439
what

2241.55 --> 2249.86
okay on a plane that I almost read into

2246.68 --> 2254.87
that we have Co treat co2 traps for

2249.86 --> 2260.75
midgets but it's for midges I don't know

2254.87 --> 2264.3399999999997
what midges is by the way but that was

2260.75 --> 2264.34
very funny for a moment there

2282.1 --> 2288.299
[Music]

2284.969 --> 2288.299
all right

2292.93 --> 2295.98
[Music]

2306.399 --> 2312.999
[ __ ] I didn't know they were called

2309.019 --> 2312.999
midges I just called them mosquitos

2336.05 --> 2339.6200000000003
that goes again

2348.839 --> 2364.319
right ax I'm getting really distracted

2354.069 --> 2364.319
by trivial stuff that doin

2369.08 --> 2377.54
right not really what I was doing it

2371.93 --> 2380.66
wasn't too late yeah I did

2377.54 --> 2384.44
yeah there was of course the ballbuster

2380.66 --> 2389.71
show it was pretty good I was by the way

2384.44 --> 2395.39
a little drunk but barely because yeah I

2389.71 --> 2397.01
have like eventually decided that I want

2395.39 --> 2400.0699999999997
a beer right now

2397.01 --> 2401.7400000000002
and that was yesterday and I don't know

2400.07 --> 2406.63
it wasn't okay

2401.74 --> 2409.97
so whatever I was going through like

2406.63 --> 2413.54
with extreme responses it seems to have

2409.97 --> 2418.16
switched back really it feels like that

2413.54 --> 2421.13
like the yeah it's my it's my grading

2418.16 --> 2429.2599999999998
back into the original place it feels

2421.13 --> 2432.94
much more smooth but yeah the ball

2429.26 --> 2435.8
busters it was okay it was pretty good

2432.94 --> 2438.43
was the flatter of math man that guy is

2435.8 --> 2438.4300000000003
just

2441.509 --> 2445.719
that's yeah there's some things really

2444.309 --> 2447.7290000000003
wrong with that guy

2445.719 --> 2449.619
and I kind of vaguely remember it

2447.729 --> 2452.259
because I used to interact with him

2449.619 --> 2455.0190000000002
slightly he's always playing like the

2452.259 --> 2459.18
super nice person but at the same time

2455.019 --> 2459.18
he inserts this crazy [ __ ]

2472.74 --> 2480.39
I have no idea Missouri bears the first

2475.14 --> 2486.21
time I'm hearing about that that's

2480.39 --> 2489.5099999999998
that's weird anyway again a reminder for

2486.21 --> 2492.95
all the members yeah after the bull

2489.51 --> 2496.9500000000003
buses was over I kept hanging around and

2492.95 --> 2500.8199999999997
then I had a I recorded at piece of

2496.95 --> 2504.0
where I grilled zanuck over the horizon

2500.82 --> 2506.1600000000003
over his yeah trying to get it through

2504.0 --> 2510.68
to his had pretty much Nathan style to

2506.16 --> 2510.68
that level pretty heavy

2510.83 --> 2515.13
trying to get through to him that the

2512.94 --> 2518.31
horizon cannot be part of any Mirage in

2515.13 --> 2521.88
effects and really putting that down and

2518.31 --> 2522.95
he yeah he got a medal he went on at

2521.88 --> 2525.9900000000002
home

2522.95 --> 2527.5499999999997
like trying to shave me with my mother

2525.99 --> 2530.8799999999997
like my mother's been dead for a long

2527.55 --> 2534.21
time like yeah so that certainly did

2530.88 --> 2536.52
break out a few cuss words on my side if

2534.21 --> 2542.96
you want to see it then yeah watch my

2536.52 --> 2542.96
upload Members Only from last night

2549.85 --> 2553.14
and squirrels

2564.19 --> 2569.799
I know squirrels can be pretty like

2566.5 --> 2572.559
forest squirrels they're very shy

2569.799 --> 2578.049
they're pretty cool it's just the one

2572.559 --> 2580.1800000000003
like you called suburban squirrels they

2578.049 --> 2584.079
get super cheeky and they just steal

2580.18 --> 2586.24
stuff and [ __ ] so yeah then I get it

2584.079 --> 2589.75
Missouri bear those types of squirrels

2586.24 --> 2592.4199999999996
are gonna be very annoying but just

2589.75 --> 2597.539
forest squirrels are very shy they're

2592.42 --> 2597.539
pretty cool they're interesting to see

2599.93 --> 2603.33
[Music]

2609.91 --> 2618.29
but it happens a lot you know you got to

2612.65 --> 2620.84
realize that some animals will like wild

2618.29 --> 2623.36
animals they will adapt to like suburban

2620.84 --> 2627.7400000000002
type of life and they will become scours

2623.36 --> 2631.4
and they will become Adam most of them

2627.74 --> 2634.0099999999998
if they can if they have the this yeah

2631.4 --> 2636.29
this the wheel as a creature then they

2634.01 --> 2640.4900000000002
can be extremely cheeky so that's why a

2636.29 --> 2642.86
lot of my older animals that go around

2640.49 --> 2647.5699999999997
in suburban areas are kind of annoying

2642.86 --> 2650.21
like raccoons they constantly create

2647.57 --> 2652.94
trash like the throw of a trash cans

2650.21 --> 2655.52
that [ __ ] like wild raccoons that don't

2652.94 --> 2660.26
really do that it's the ones that kind

2655.52 --> 2663.41
of choose to become yeah to engage in

2660.26 --> 2671.96
human society in suburban areas they get

2663.41 --> 2674.1499999999996
all annoying it's funny how that works

2671.96 --> 2676.82
because in nature they really had

2674.15 --> 2678.9500000000003
they're kind of like in a more ancient

2676.82 --> 2682.4300000000003
balance and they have to be very

2678.95 --> 2686.5099999999998
vigilant and very careful in suburban

2682.43 --> 2688.8199999999997
areas like it's really easy pickings for

2686.51 --> 2693.86
them in many ways if they can figure out

2688.82 --> 2696.4700000000003
how to how to get stuff and so they

2693.86 --> 2699.9500000000003
become kind of spoiled and cheeky

2696.47 --> 2701.75
towards humans like haha you're just

2699.95 --> 2704.45
leaving all that [ __ ] you're throwing

2701.75 --> 2709.48
all that [ __ ] away that's we're just

2704.45 --> 2709.48
gonna take it yeah

2710.87 --> 2718.91
okay Missouri bear calm down oh don't

2715.56 --> 2718.91
start shooting squirrels

2725.95 --> 2730.6189999999997
[Music]

2740.79 --> 2749.31
no coyotes damn if coyotes get cheeky

2747.03 --> 2754.71
and start wandering into suburban areas

2749.31 --> 2757.64
then you got a problem those are some

2754.71 --> 2757.64
messed of creatures

2758.91 --> 2762.0299999999997
[Music]

2772.39 --> 2775.17
right

2787.839 --> 2793.64
in a way I think it would be an

2790.94 --> 2794.18
interesting challenge to try something

2793.64 --> 2798.769
like that

2794.18 --> 2802.46
try a pretty basic farm setup in the

2798.769 --> 2804.1699999999996
wild or like almost in the wild well for

2802.46 --> 2806.839
the Netherlands that would be the wild

2804.17 --> 2810.46
because it's very rare to be able to do

2806.839 --> 2815.029
that compared to the United States and

2810.46 --> 2816.89
just to figure out like how to properly

2815.029 --> 2820.75
protect all your creatures and still

2816.89 --> 2825.22
give them a good time

2820.75 --> 2825.22
against the wilds yeah

2827.28 --> 2830.449
[Music]

2838.95 --> 2842.1299999999997
[Music]

2851.02 --> 2858.7
right well you have it the issue is is

2853.78 --> 2861.7900000000004
that the welds are basically all like

2858.7 --> 2864.8199999999997
and they should be protected it's like

2861.79 --> 2867.97
no you can't just start catching a patch

2864.82 --> 2870.7000000000003
of woods and then starting a small farm

2867.97 --> 2876.49
or something and you should because

2870.7 --> 2880.33
there is very little forest left so they

2876.49 --> 2882.9399999999996
mostly just try to turn it into a yeah a

2880.33 --> 2890.0099999999998
wild park situated like create walking

2882.94 --> 2893.46
paths and then maintain it so that ya

2890.01 --> 2896.11
doesn't grow to health and all that and

2893.46 --> 2898.869
yeah that's how we maintain the forests

2896.11 --> 2902.4100000000003
here I'm pretty satisfied by how that

2898.869 --> 2905.8900000000003
goes on average although like there's

2902.41 --> 2908.0499999999997
issues with the organizations that get

2905.89 --> 2912.22
involved with that as well they make

2908.05 --> 2914.2200000000003
very crazy decisions sometimes pisses a

2912.22 --> 2919.81
lot off a lot of people that actually

2914.22 --> 2922.5099999999998
appreciate nature but on average things

2919.81 --> 2924.369
are done pretty well here I think but

2922.51 --> 2928.1800000000003
yeah there's no more room you know it is

2924.369 --> 2933.01
not like thousands and thousands of

2928.18 --> 2935.74
square miles of just wilds that nobody

2933.01 --> 2938.98
yeah nobody ever goes at and it's just

2935.74 --> 2941.2599999999998
like oh yeah sure why not just if you

2938.98 --> 2943.3
want a little house in the middle of the

2941.26 --> 2946.05
nature sure go ahead no that's that

2943.3 --> 2946.05
doesn't happen here

2955.27 --> 2958.329
[Music]

2963.33 --> 2972.36
right well if you find that crazy just

2968.07 --> 2975.03
realize that the Netherlands is a much

2972.36 --> 2978.6
less hostile type of environment so it's

2975.03 --> 2982.2900000000004
doable like the Netherlands is almost

2978.6 --> 2984.96
like it a giant City compared to like

2982.29 --> 2989.49
you cities out there it's a giant cities

2984.96 --> 2993.7400000000002
with yeah mostly just suburban area in

2989.49 --> 2997.35
between it all and yeah bits few farms

2993.74 --> 3002.24
not so many more greenhouses these days

2997.35 --> 3008.0899999999997
and and some sort of original wild

3002.24 --> 3012.0099999999998
turned into Park situations so it's like

3008.09 --> 3018.38
a giant city state with some suburban

3012.01 --> 3020.03
elements in between so yeah of course

3018.38 --> 3023.2400000000002
there's gonna fit a lot more people in

3020.03 --> 3036.65
there because it's not raw and wild and

3023.24 --> 3039.5
snowing all the freaking year it's not

3036.65 --> 3041.2400000000002
as in inhospitable here as it is in

3039.5 --> 3044.42
Norway

3041.24 --> 3044.4199999999996
[Music]

3058.04 --> 3064.64
Missouri bear yeah that's a good

3059.99 --> 3067.6299999999997
question I have no idea why would you

3064.64 --> 3072.0499999999997
think there should be a Southern Lights

3067.63 --> 3074.03
said because of the the poles like the

3072.05 --> 3077.6600000000003
magnetic like they say that it's caused

3074.03 --> 3079.52
by the magnetic poles yeah having

3077.66 --> 3083.75
certain like Stardust or whatever

3079.52 --> 3086.96
inserted or stuff from the Sun or

3083.75 --> 3089.93
whatever and you I don't know should it

3086.96 --> 3093.7400000000002
enter the south do they even claim it

3089.93 --> 3095.8999999999996
enters and at the South Pole as well I

3093.74 --> 3100.3399999999997
don't know if that if it really is the

3095.9 --> 3102.4700000000003
case but I don't I personally don't

3100.34 --> 3104.98
really understand what causes it in the

3102.47 --> 3104.98
first place

3117.36 --> 3124.2000000000003
shouldn't it be the same well

3121.74 --> 3129.8399999999997
considering that the earth is supposedly

3124.2 --> 3134.2799999999997
tilting in relation to the the orbit

3129.84 --> 3136.9500000000003
around the Sun yeah if it is supposedly

3134.28 --> 3138.9
that stuff B is because of some supposed

3136.95 --> 3141.6
interaction with stuff coming from the

3138.9 --> 3145.7400000000002
Sun in the heliocentric model then yeah

3141.6 --> 3148.0499999999997
I guess there should be the same at the

3145.74 --> 3151.1899999999996
South Pole if it is indeed magnetic

3148.05 --> 3153.9300000000003
related and the earth is a globe right

3151.19 --> 3156.9
on the other hand they might reason that

3153.93 --> 3159.0299999999997
because of the charge directions north

3156.9 --> 3160.92
the south or whatever that it can only

3159.03 --> 3162.21
enter at the North I don't know what

3160.92 --> 3168.48
they're gonna say about that I have no

3162.21 --> 3170.96
idea I've never heard of Southern Lights

3168.48 --> 3170.96
though

3180.67 --> 3189.1800000000003
can be seen from New Zealand Tasmania

3184.12 --> 3194.5
and southern part of our did what really

3189.18 --> 3199.56
they do you have some film footage of

3194.5 --> 3199.56
that not just photos some filmed footage

3207.48 --> 3214.02
Hey whenever you say you have a but I'd

3211.63 --> 3217.0
like to see that I'd like to see some

3214.02 --> 3223.5099999999998
like live filmed evidence where the

3217.0 --> 3226.21
camera is actually moving and [ __ ] to

3223.51 --> 3229.9300000000003
ensure that it yeah or to be able to

3226.21 --> 3234.07
trace any type of machinations you know

3229.93 --> 3236.1699999999996
because that might happen just a photo

3234.07 --> 3239.5
okay yeah they could just say look this

3236.17 --> 3241.2400000000002
is the southern light I want to see it

3239.5 --> 3254.92
move and all that I want to see the

3241.24 --> 3257.3199999999997
camera move all right Missouri bear that

3254.92 --> 3259.9300000000003
anyway that's really nice that's a nice

3257.32 --> 3263.65
claim we have if you could actually find

3259.93 --> 3265.7799999999997
some video footage that could support

3263.65 --> 3268.9300000000003
that then I'd be interested you know

3265.78 --> 3271.11
because who knows maybe maybe it is the

3268.93 --> 3271.1099999999997
game

3283.09 --> 3286.239
[Music]

3288.26 --> 3295.75
you rule on duty yeah I'd love to hear

3291.47 --> 3295.75
from him about it

3302.24 --> 3311.839
time and date does come says oh wow well

3306.859 --> 3314.5699999999997
dank if they say it is that's not really

3311.839 --> 3316.839
the level of evidence that I was looking

3314.57 --> 3316.839
for

3324.05 --> 3332.3100000000004
that the issue is I actually like they

3329.46 --> 3334.26
have this one photo in there and it's

3332.31 --> 3337.47
probably Nord that looks like Northern

3334.26 --> 3341.5200000000004
Light so it's just a just so story at

3337.47 --> 3345.27
this point I want to see the the visual

3341.52 --> 3347.07
filmed evidence that will be great but

3345.27 --> 3350.22
anyway it's interesting thing to bring

3347.07 --> 3352.1400000000003
up who knows who knows for what it'll

3350.22 --> 3353.73
work what are the lead to but anyway I

3352.14 --> 3355.02
am gonna round out to show because the

3353.73 --> 3357.63
Flat Earth debates have already started

3355.02 --> 3359.22
