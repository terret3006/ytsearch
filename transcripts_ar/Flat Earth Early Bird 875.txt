this year is blue sky

111.68 --> 118.07900000000001
no trails to be seen

115.2 --> 119.60000000000001
very very little fluffy clouds here and

118.079 --> 125.19999999999999
there but it's mostly just

119.6 --> 125.19999999999999
clear blue skies sun shining right

125.6 --> 133.51999999999998
seems to be completely wind still

129.039 --> 133.51999999999998
making it very nice

139.92 --> 143.83999999999997
trees are blossoming

146.64 --> 157.83999999999997

165.36 --> 174.239
so it is monday the

168.48 --> 174.23899999999998
26th of april 2021

174.4 --> 178.48000000000002
so here we go again first in chat

182.84 --> 185.84
morning

196.84 --> 201.36
ah

198.0 --> 201.36
nice and relaxed

202.159 --> 209.76
so yeah

205.68 --> 211.68
got up pretty good time

209.76 --> 212.879
i haven't gone out for groceries just

211.68 --> 215.92000000000002
yet

212.879 --> 217.44
at early lunch

215.92 --> 219.35999999999999
i thought i'll just get that out of the

217.44 --> 221.28
way because i got up really hungry

219.36 --> 226.31900000000002
kind of similar to yesterday it's also

221.28 --> 229.44
because i basically haven't gotten

226.319 --> 230.95899999999997
dinner for two days and then i do tend

229.44 --> 233.44
to get a little more hungry in the

230.959 --> 233.44
mornings

238.84 --> 245.12
but

241.84 --> 247.68
feeling pretty good compared to like

245.12 --> 247.68
the weekend

252.84 --> 255.84
yesterday

257.759 --> 261.68
yesterday's early bird was pretty good

262.079 --> 266.72
and so was the flat earth debate

264.32 --> 271.59999999999997
premiere

266.72 --> 274.96000000000004
from friday really fun

271.6 --> 277.52000000000004
energetic show although yeah the

274.96 --> 282.85999999999996
the crew could barely get in really

277.52 --> 284.0
nathan was really at it

282.86 --> 288.56
[Music]

284.0 --> 292.479
london triumph at half a million

288.56 --> 296.4
seven hours peaceful prostate protest

292.479 --> 300.08
and the police ruined it i did

296.4 --> 301.67999999999995
definitely did catch on to that protest

300.08 --> 306.4
going on

301.68 --> 306.40000000000003
from like even from dutch news

307.919 --> 314.4
glad to hear was a successful

311.039 --> 314.4
oh hello dean right

314.8 --> 318.8
right he's no bald heart well he

316.56 --> 322.72
certainly seems to

318.8 --> 325.52000000000004
act like that so that doesn't make

322.72 --> 326.639
a lot of sense so i think he's just

325.52 --> 329.59999999999997
playing

326.639 --> 329.6
just playing around

332.96 --> 337.75899999999996
i don't know if he's ever gonna drop the

334.96 --> 341.919
act though this could just be his new

337.759 --> 341.91900000000004
position that he's taking so

346.08 --> 353.44
right oh yeah also yesterday

349.759 --> 356.56
i got skype call with

353.44 --> 358.4
adam mekin which is really good

356.56 --> 359.919
lasted longer than i thought like he

358.4 --> 363.44
helped me fix

359.919 --> 366.71999999999997
the sound situation on obs

363.44 --> 370.0
so now i can get skype calls and

366.72 --> 372.639
yeah get get a proper sound

370.0 --> 373.759
input from them without any echoes and

372.639 --> 376.639
everything

373.759 --> 377.759
so yeah i can now do skype calls pretty

376.639 --> 380.08
easily

377.759 --> 381.36
good very happy about that thanks adam

380.08 --> 384.88
meekin

381.36 --> 387.44
also he gave me some heartfelt advice

384.88 --> 391.759
and we even talked about

387.44 --> 395.84
jesus christ like the esoteric approach

391.759 --> 395.84000000000003
which he seems to like yeah

397.039 --> 403.28
he doesn't constantly talk about that

401.039 --> 405.44
i talk more about it but it seems like

403.28 --> 409.19899999999996
he's agreeing in many ways

405.44 --> 412.639
like his own angle

409.199 --> 417.68
his own development

412.639 --> 417.68
but yeah we resonate really heavily and

419.759 --> 426.72
it was very interesting and he did like

423.28 --> 430.23999999999995
give me some

426.72 --> 430.24
encouraging advice

430.72 --> 438.24
situation and because yeah he

433.84 --> 441.75899999999996
had a mikin like knows me personally

438.24 --> 445.52
we already connected amsterdam

441.759 --> 445.52000000000004
conference in 2019

446.0 --> 452.56
uh yeah just it was good

450.4 --> 454.71999999999997
in a way i really needed that i needed

452.56 --> 454.72

463.68 --> 468.24

a little warm for that but

512.32 --> 519.12
no extra coffee today it didn't work out

515.919 --> 522.959
during the show though

519.12 --> 522.9590000000001

529.6 --> 535.839
cool well welcome to the chat j

532.959 --> 535.8389999999999
is that

536.24 --> 540.399
hello cameron kamikaze gilmore

550.399 --> 555.839
right so yeah jay i talk about a whole

552.8 --> 555.8389999999999
lot of things here

555.92 --> 561.8389999999999
also about my own personal life

559.2 --> 562.48
and yeah because yeah that's what

561.839 --> 564.1600000000001
happens

562.48 --> 566.8000000000001
when you have a daily show that you're

564.16 --> 568.48
doing on your own i basically also use

566.8 --> 571.68
it to talk a lot about

568.48 --> 575.12
kind of what i do and how i'm

571.68 --> 578.959
dealing with things but yes

575.12 --> 582.16
i talk about various different subjects

578.959 --> 586.8
uh of course prime staple flat earth

582.16 --> 588.88
and cosmogeny and my own little

586.8 --> 591.92
personal project within it the the

588.88 --> 594.08
rectangular looping earth

591.92 --> 595.68
and how that works what it could be all

594.08 --> 598.72
that

595.68 --> 602.7199999999999
uh in london i am not in london

598.72 --> 602.72
jay is that i'm in the netherlands in

602.839 --> 607.2
utrecht

604.399 --> 609.279
here we go again went to london during

607.2 --> 613.44
the protest

609.279 --> 613.4399999999999
but yeah not me of course i'm here

617.279 --> 621.519
right but and beside flat earth talk

619.2 --> 621.519
about

622.48 --> 625.9200000000001
yeah alternative history how i think

624.959 --> 629.8389999999999
things have been

625.92 --> 632.959
rearranged baltimore that's

629.839 --> 633.44
united states is it

632.959 --> 636.539
right

633.44 --> 636.5390000000001
[Music]

641.839 --> 648.6400000000001
and yeah i talk a lot

645.36 --> 651.6
of esoterics as in i am

648.64 --> 651.6
very much into

654.8 --> 660.959
perception and like

658.24 --> 661.839
higher dimensional thinking you could

660.959 --> 664.88
say

661.839 --> 667.12
fractal thinking i involve the

664.88 --> 668.0
spiritual the timeless dimension in

667.12 --> 669.92
which i've had

668.0 --> 671.76
significant amount of experiences

669.92 --> 674.24
especially in the past and it's kind of

671.76 --> 676.88
been like this giant puzzle that have

674.24 --> 680.16
been trying to work out

676.88 --> 680.8
over the last 20 years roughly but

680.16 --> 683.92
really

680.8 --> 685.04
especially since i started to go live on

683.92 --> 687.36
youtube

685.04 --> 689.1999999999999
was it at the time it was really hitting

687.36 --> 692.64
me like a lot of memories just

689.2 --> 693.9200000000001
creeped up on me at first mostly

692.64 --> 696.399
frightening and now

693.92 --> 697.36
i'm figuring it out more and more like

696.399 --> 699.519
what is it

697.36 --> 701.12
how did it work what did i actually get

699.519 --> 704.399
to see

701.12 --> 708.64
how does the experience mechanics

704.399 --> 711.839
of it work very comparable to

708.64 --> 715.04
i guess some sort of

711.839 --> 719.12
extra dimensional astral projection

715.04 --> 722.399
and it's it's also in a way amusing

719.12 --> 725.76
interesting that there's like

722.399 --> 729.6
sci-fi sort of sci-fi movies

725.76 --> 730.399
and series that try to express this as

729.6 --> 733.12
well

730.399 --> 733.6
and there's been a couple of movies that

733.12 --> 736.48
were

733.6 --> 737.519
quite good at it at representing what

736.48 --> 739.76
many of my

737.519 --> 741.6
dark world experiences were as i call

739.76 --> 745.8389999999999
them what they were like

741.6 --> 745.839
it's really impressive to just see that

749.76 --> 753.04
so yeah talk about that

753.279 --> 756.88
and relate that to experiences and

755.2 --> 759.9200000000001
basically try to draw

756.88 --> 761.92
out predictions because yeah the

759.92 --> 763.5999999999999
the main dark world vision i had

761.92 --> 766.399
basically spanned

763.6 --> 768.399
an 80-year period something like that it

766.399 --> 769.68
was a very long experience that in the

768.399 --> 773.68
physical world

769.68 --> 777.519
probably lasted about a minute

773.68 --> 778.399
and with it having had glimpses into my

777.519 --> 781.04
own future

778.399 --> 784.079
but then yeah the cassandra complex

781.04 --> 786.48
effect kind of sets in because

784.079 --> 788.959
it seems to me like i can't really

786.48 --> 792.639
remember

788.959 --> 794.399
things from it in order to change how

792.639 --> 797.839
things go it's rather like

794.399 --> 802.639
i got the early edition of the book

797.839 --> 806.0
of myself it's it's kind of weird

802.639 --> 806.0
i'm kind of weird like that

810.0 --> 814.32
i think most of history was written not

812.16 --> 817.36
so much rewritten well

814.32 --> 817.36
you got a point there

820.72 --> 825.36
rewriting history is very difficult but

823.68 --> 829.04
if you just have

825.36 --> 833.12
stories historical things

829.04 --> 836.3199999999999
historical stories to basically supplant

833.12 --> 838.5600000000001
other things that have happened that are

836.32 --> 839.9200000000001
politically inconvenient for power

838.56 --> 843.279
groups

839.92 --> 846.8
or have had have had need

843.279 --> 851.36
to be that had to be removed because of

846.8 --> 853.68
certain educational mindsets

851.36 --> 854.839
that were part of grand social

853.68 --> 858.16
engineering

854.839 --> 860.639
plots by the controllers the rulers

858.16 --> 865.279
however you want to call them

860.639 --> 865.279
to shape how we are supposed to think

865.519 --> 868.8
and so yes a lot of things have been cut

868.32 --> 871.1990000000001
out

868.8 --> 872.24
and other things have been made to

871.199 --> 876.639
supplant

872.24 --> 876.639
those things and shape how we think

877.12 --> 883.36
and it's quite complex also

880.72 --> 885.9200000000001
yeah a lot of replacement history has

883.36 --> 888.5600000000001
been designed to be

885.92 --> 889.4399999999999
realistic up to a certain point and

888.56 --> 892.8
appealing

889.44 --> 899.44
right so that we hold on to

892.8 --> 901.75
how we learned it

899.44 --> 903.1990000000001
anyway

901.75 --> 908.639
[Music]

903.199 --> 908.639
welcome to the chat i am open for

910.839 --> 913.839
questions

914.24 --> 918.8
also yeah yesterday i watched the truman

916.8 --> 921.5999999999999
show again

918.8 --> 924.639
what an impressive movie it is for the

921.6 --> 924.639
time that it came out

924.8 --> 928.3199999999999
it's so weird because i still remember

927.199 --> 932.0
how i

928.32 --> 935.12
heard that it was on

932.0 --> 938.56
that it was coming out in a

935.12 --> 941.6
in a time when i myself was just

938.56 --> 945.3599999999999
about catching on on how

941.6 --> 948.0790000000001
messed up the world really is

945.36 --> 949.1990000000001
it's kind of getting out of my

948.079 --> 952.399
idealistic

949.199 --> 954.88
bubble view of the world

952.399 --> 956.16
and so when that movie came out it

954.88 --> 958.48
scared me

956.16 --> 962.3199999999999
i didn't want to know about it then i

958.48 --> 964.9590000000001
was literally just trying to avoid it

962.32 --> 966.399
but yeah then looking seeing it

964.959 --> 970.4799999999999
afterward

966.399 --> 970.48
it's really very impressive

972.56 --> 976.399
right instead though i did latch onto

975.199 --> 978.399
the matrix

976.399 --> 980.639
but i didn't see it in theater the first

978.399 --> 980.639
one

981.68 --> 986.88
but yeah the matrix i latched onto that

984.24 --> 989.44
also because of the style

986.88 --> 990.16
i really liked the style of it i liked

989.44 --> 992.48
it so much

990.16 --> 996.3199999999999
actually that i kind of adapted my own

992.48 --> 999.44
style to that

996.32 --> 1000.0790000000001
like black trench coats i usually wear

999.44 --> 1002.0
all black

1000.079 --> 1004.2399999999999
although these days i wear a white

1002.0 --> 1008.24
t-shirt underneath it all

1004.24 --> 1008.24
and when it's warm i just wear the white

1008.839 --> 1013.1990000000001
t-shirt

1010.959 --> 1014.4799999999999
but yeah the truman show is a really

1013.199 --> 1017.199
impressive

1014.48 --> 1017.1990000000001
movie and

1017.759 --> 1025.839
jim carrey is just a really impressive

1022.839 --> 1025.839
actor

1034.319 --> 1039.839
so it was good watching that again

1039.919 --> 1045.2800000000002
13th floor yeah i i learned about the 30

1043.12 --> 1048.4799999999998
13th floor much later i just think i

1045.28 --> 1051.44
watched that the first time in

1048.48 --> 1051.44
2008

1051.679 --> 1055.679
but that one certainly kind of slipped

1053.84 --> 1059.9189999999999
under the radar

1055.679 --> 1059.919
i don't think many people knew about it

1060.559 --> 1064.32
like when it came out probably learned

1063.36 --> 1066.1599999999999
more about it

1064.32 --> 1067.36
when the matrix came out and they were

1066.16 --> 1069.8400000000001
like hey

1067.36 --> 1070.4799999999998
but there is another movie that kind of

1069.84 --> 1081.1999999999998
did that

1070.48 --> 1083.28
first the 13th floor

1081.2 --> 1085.28
i should probably watch it again it's

1083.28 --> 1088.3999999999999
been a while

1085.28 --> 1092.0
dark city you know yeah but dark city is

1088.4 --> 1096.5590000000002
different dark city is really like

1092.0 --> 1099.6
gothic fantasy in many ways and

1096.559 --> 1102.16
that makes it not so realistic

1099.6 --> 1102.6399999999999
right it has a similar theme but it's

1102.16 --> 1108.64
just

1102.64 --> 1111.76
it's in many ways just way too surreal

1108.64 --> 1115.6000000000001
and 13th floor was was much more

1111.76 --> 1119.44
just about the simulation

1115.6 --> 1122.48
and the matrix also

1119.44 --> 1125.6000000000001
was much more like a sci-fi

1122.48 --> 1129.28
approach of it all

1125.6 --> 1129.28
dark city was just freaky

1129.6 --> 1133.36
that that movie was creepy

1134.96 --> 1140.799
i wonder what the matrix 4 will be like

1136.96 --> 1143.039
yeah it still hasn't come out has it

1140.799 --> 1145.28
doubt they could really top it no they

1143.039 --> 1149.44
definitely won't

1145.28 --> 1152.24
like but who knows they might

1149.44 --> 1153.28
they might make something interesting

1152.24 --> 1156.799
that's

1153.28 --> 1160.72
that could be like a worthy continuation

1156.799 --> 1163.039
but it's never going to be as focused

1160.72 --> 1164.32
as the original movie was like that's

1163.039 --> 1169.2
just

1164.32 --> 1170.3899999999999
no way it really was a special moment

1169.2 --> 1172.72
back then

1170.39 --> 1174.3200000000002
[Music]

1172.72 --> 1176.0
but still yeah i'm very curious what

1174.32 --> 1178.6399999999999
it's going to be like

1176.0 --> 1180.24
what they're going with how serious

1178.64 --> 1182.48
they're actually gonna take it

1180.24 --> 1184.799
they're gonna focus more on the style

1182.48 --> 1188.16
and actually let it all get polluted

1184.799 --> 1189.679
or whether like they're really gonna

1188.16 --> 1193.2
focus on

1189.679 --> 1196.64
the entire sci-fi framework of it

1193.2 --> 1197.919
and then make a worthy follow-up i don't

1196.64 --> 1201.2800000000002
know

1197.919 --> 1201.2800000000002
but yeah we'll find out

1202.0 --> 1207.6
you the fake writers that checks yeah

1204.84 --> 1207.6
whatever ever

1212.88 --> 1216.24
dude i don't really care about the

1215.2 --> 1221.8400000000001
writers

1216.24 --> 1221.84
the movies were good

1222.48 --> 1226.32
and hey if these writers are gonna make

1224.48 --> 1229.2
it all about [ __ ] and [ __ ] yeah

1226.32 --> 1232.48
that's gonna be annoying as [ __ ]

1229.2 --> 1235.6000000000001
i hope they won't because they'll yeah

1232.48 --> 1238.88
that they're not gonna make themselves

1235.6 --> 1238.8799999999999
more popular like that

1246.88 --> 1252.3200000000002
passport fired september doesn't what

1250.0 --> 1252.32
okay

1256.96 --> 1263.8400000000001
wow terminoid i i i didn't even know

1260.32 --> 1263.84
that that's crazy

1269.65 --> 1272.8090000000002
[Music]

1285.52 --> 1289.2
in the interrogation see yeah i i

1288.08 --> 1292.08
figured out where

1289.2 --> 1295.28
that would have been visible i hadn't

1292.08 --> 1298.0
like i haven't really sifted through

1295.28 --> 1300.799
the movie like frame by frame to pick up

1298.0 --> 1304.48
on the easter eggs and everything

1300.799 --> 1307.039
i'm not really the guy to do that i just

1304.48 --> 1309.6
really like to watch the movie and get

1307.039 --> 1309.6
into it

1311.2 --> 1314.32
but yeah no surprise that there's like

1313.12 --> 1319.84
these weird

1314.32 --> 1319.84
little easter eggs in there

1323.039 --> 1326.72
hey terra 306

1331.12 --> 1334.6399999999999
there's no background sound

1334.799 --> 1341.6
oh right yeah that's true you guys miss

1338.32 --> 1347.84
it because i put in some filters

1341.6 --> 1347.84
on the microphone

1350.48 --> 1354.88
i could turn it off temporarily

1355.52 --> 1361.84
put it back on

1372.159 --> 1375.8400000000001
move it

1377.28 --> 1379.6
okay

1380.88 --> 1389.8400000000001
right so you should get like the

1382.48 --> 1389.84
background sounds with it currently

1395.76 --> 1402.1589999999999
or you thought it was better is it

1398.159 --> 1405.0390000000002
better with the filter or without it you

1402.159 --> 1405.0390000000002
tell me territ

1412.4 --> 1416.96
oh by the way hello ralph rodriguez

1415.039 --> 1418.96
thank you for the suit for the paypal

1416.96 --> 1431.8400000000001
donation the other day

1418.96 --> 1431.8400000000001
appreciate that

1436.88 --> 1440.0
you like the background noise okay oh

1439.36 --> 1441.6789999999999
that's

1440.0 --> 1445.84
complicated then you're going to be

1441.679 --> 1445.8400000000001
divided about it

1455.279 --> 1459.039
do an entire show with filters so we can

1457.2 --> 1464.72
judge okay okay

1459.039 --> 1464.72
i'll put it back i know how to do it now

1470.0 --> 1473.84
okay it's back on

1484.88 --> 1488.4
all right one advantage of it is too

1487.2 --> 1491.039
that

1488.4 --> 1492.159
just other pop-up sounds and all that

1491.039 --> 1495.2
it's not going to come

1492.159 --> 1495.2
come through so

1495.919 --> 1501.8400000000001
that's kind of nice about it

1510.32 --> 1516.08
a slo-mo moon buggy

1514.48 --> 1519.84
birds and kids playing in the background

1516.08 --> 1519.84
is nice yeah i do agree to that

1524.32 --> 1529.84
and there is plenty of birds getting

1526.4 --> 1529.8400000000001
active out there so

1547.6 --> 1552.7199999999998
right i think i'm gonna take out the

1551.679 --> 1554.96
filter

1552.72 --> 1555.76
for now at least i know how to get it in

1554.96 --> 1558.64
now i know

1555.76 --> 1559.84
also that if i'm gonna have somebody

1558.64 --> 1565.039
call it over skype

1559.84 --> 1567.279
i have to turn on it the noise gate

1565.039 --> 1568.84
and then like yeah it's not gonna have

1567.279 --> 1571.84
some kind of

1568.84 --> 1571.84
echo

1575.76 --> 1581.12
all right so anyway uh already half an

1578.96 --> 1585.8400000000001
hour in

1581.12 --> 1585.84
you guys want to talk about

1589.79 --> 1592.97
[Music]

1612.08 --> 1627.84
uh i did also scout around

1616.799 --> 1627.84
the news

1631.6 --> 1635.52
man like the newscape where i typically

1634.48 --> 1639.679
watch is so

1635.52 --> 1643.36
filled up with just covet related things

1639.679 --> 1646.24
as in a lot of people

1643.36 --> 1648.799
coming out and just kind of trying to

1646.24 --> 1648.799
stop it

1649.44 --> 1652.72
it just keeps on coming

1652.88 --> 1656.72
and there's a lot of criticism even like

1655.2 --> 1660.3990000000001
locally here in the country

1656.72 --> 1661.3600000000001
about the covet policy from within the

1660.399 --> 1663.9189999999999
medical system

1661.36 --> 1664.6399999999999
how it's actually detrimental and all

1663.919 --> 1668.0
that this

1664.64 --> 1671.2
just a lot

1668.0 --> 1671.2
a lot going on

1680.84 --> 1683.84
right

1685.279 --> 1689.279
a lot of annoying political stuff where

1688.399 --> 1691.84
just

1689.279 --> 1692.72
like our government is literally just

1691.84 --> 1695.76
handing of

1692.72 --> 1699.2
giving away a lot of money

1695.76 --> 1703.039
to to help with covet

1699.2 --> 1703.039
like in foreign countries it's just

1704.24 --> 1711.84
really aggravating

1717.44 --> 1722.8400000000001
is protesting a futile thing of hair

1719.84 --> 1725.84
have you had enough of that subject

1722.84 --> 1725.84
uh

1730.32 --> 1734.72
right here we go again well protest it's

1732.64 --> 1738.48
complicated

1734.72 --> 1740.96
just protesting

1738.48 --> 1742.08
on its own doesn't really help it only

1740.96 --> 1745.44
helps

1742.08 --> 1746.08
if there is it like if it's going to

1745.44 --> 1750.0
wake up

1746.08 --> 1752.6399999999999
people to the state of things

1750.0 --> 1753.44
and if there's going to be people that

1752.64 --> 1756.3200000000002
are

1753.44 --> 1756.799
actually able to do something about the

1756.32 --> 1759.84
issue

1756.799 --> 1762.399
that is being protested against right

1759.84 --> 1763.4399999999998
if it's just protesting to kind of like

1762.399 --> 1767.039
give the people

1763.44 --> 1768.799
room to vent dissatisfaction

1767.039 --> 1770.48
and then i have a guarantee that

1768.799 --> 1772.48
nothing's going to be done about it

1770.48 --> 1775.44
yeah then it becomes useless then it

1772.48 --> 1775.44
becomes pointless

1775.52 --> 1785.039
but if there is still plenty of people

1781.84 --> 1785.4399999999998
that could do something about it there's

1785.039 --> 1788.8799999999999
still

1785.44 --> 1789.52
influence possible against the system

1788.88 --> 1791.6000000000001
that is

1789.52 --> 1793.44
doing all these things when against

1791.6 --> 1797.4399999999998
which is being protested then

1793.44 --> 1797.44
yes it still has its function

1800.96 --> 1809.8400000000001
but like constantly protesting

1804.559 --> 1809.84
it's difficult

1815.039 --> 1819.919
you gotta have a plan so if you're just

1818.399 --> 1822.2399999999998
gonna protest a protest

1819.919 --> 1823.3600000000001
without a long-term plan then it's just

1822.24 --> 1826.72
going to be mostly

1823.36 --> 1827.6
a drain on resources of the ones doing

1826.72 --> 1830.64
it

1827.6 --> 1835.12
so how high in altitude do you believe

1830.64 --> 1837.8400000000001
man has gotten i don't know man i really

1835.12 --> 1837.84
have no idea

1846.08 --> 1851.84
all right here we go again

1869.279 --> 1872.88
most protesting isn't organic well yeah

1872.159 --> 1876.0
protests

1872.88 --> 1878.88
can also be just political stunts

1876.0 --> 1880.88
can be organized and then sponsored

1878.88 --> 1885.3600000000001
literally people being paid

1880.88 --> 1888.72
to do it for some stupid political stunt

1885.36 --> 1892.559
like what well what the left the left

1888.72 --> 1895.84
the left it's not much of a left there's

1892.559 --> 1898.1589999999999
not much much left of the left in the

1895.84 --> 1898.1589999999999
left

1898.64 --> 1905.2
it's just it's corporate communist

1902.0 --> 1907.76
garbage right well when they do that

1905.2 --> 1909.76
then they're going to be used by

1907.76 --> 1911.84
politics to do something right

1909.76 --> 1913.44
those protests aren't really protests

1911.84 --> 1916.48
they're just political stunts

1913.44 --> 1916.48
they're all sponsored

1917.84 --> 1924.559
but yeah people actually

1921.44 --> 1925.8400000000001
not agreeing with current government

1924.559 --> 1927.84
policy

1925.84 --> 1930.6399999999999
and then trying to do something about it

1927.84 --> 1930.6399999999999
through protest

1931.2 --> 1939.1200000000001
it does work to at least

1934.48 --> 1939.1200000000001
get recognition for it

1939.919 --> 1943.919
so it's all kind of complicated

1944.32 --> 1949.84
say higher than 20 miles well

1969.039 --> 1977.84
the poll tax what

1978.48 --> 1991.84
what are you talking about poll tax what

2014.08 --> 2019.84
oh okay

2021.06 --> 2024.799
[Music]

2022.88 --> 2026.48
all right well remember if you're

2024.799 --> 2028.32
actually

2026.48 --> 2030.0
trying to directly communicate with

2028.32 --> 2033.039
somebody else in chat to

2030.0 --> 2035.2
add their name because especially when

2033.039 --> 2036.559
the chat is not completely filled up

2035.2 --> 2039.76
with people

2036.559 --> 2040.08
different people i'm going to probably

2039.76 --> 2044.48
be

2040.08 --> 2044.48
interacting with the ones talking in

2044.84 --> 2050.0
there

2046.48 --> 2050.0
was margaret thatcher okay

2056.879 --> 2061.839
that's from quite a while ago

2066.32 --> 2073.44
right but overall

2070.0 --> 2075.44
like protesting in the later part of the

2073.44 --> 2077.839
20th century

2075.44 --> 2079.839
and in the last 20 years like it's

2077.839 --> 2082.0789999999997
complete it works differently now the

2079.839 --> 2084.48
world has changed

2082.079 --> 2085.9190000000003
since that time back then protesting had

2084.48 --> 2089.679
a much more direct

2085.919 --> 2093.1189999999997
impact and media was less

2089.679 --> 2093.119
corporate and corrupted

2093.28 --> 2103.8390000000004
so it actually had a more

2097.2 --> 2103.839
natural influence compared to now

2114.839 --> 2117.839
hmm

2124.1 --> 2127.19
[Music]

2151.839 --> 2155.92
more dumbed down now well more

2154.4 --> 2157.839
indoctrinated and

2155.92 --> 2160.079
because of that effectively dumbed down

2157.839 --> 2162.48
there is just so much

2160.079 --> 2164.6400000000003
media input and there is less control

2162.48 --> 2168.8
over it

2164.64 --> 2171.52
just realize that 50 years ago

2168.8 --> 2172.1600000000003
things that were on television were just

2171.52 --> 2175.04
heavily

2172.16 --> 2177.5989999999997
scrutinized there were like committees

2175.04 --> 2180.96
everywhere that would always be

2177.599 --> 2182.48
overlooking like is this proper thing to

2180.96 --> 2186.0
put on television

2182.48 --> 2188.4
right remember that time

2186.0 --> 2188.4
yeah the

2190.64 --> 2195.5989999999997
some of the older audience may remember

2194.079 --> 2198.5600000000004
that that used to be there

2195.599 --> 2198.96
it was there with radio i think it still

2198.56 --> 2201.44
is

2198.96 --> 2203.599
in a way television but since the

2201.44 --> 2207.359
internet really broke through

2203.599 --> 2210.0
all these restrictive systems

2207.359 --> 2213.2
just have lost their grip and it's kind

2210.0 --> 2215.76
of like a corporate free for all now

2213.2 --> 2216.3999999999996
and the only way to do anything about

2215.76 --> 2219.8390000000004
anything

2216.4 --> 2223.359
is if yeah a large

2219.839 --> 2226.32
or the majority political movement

2223.359 --> 2227.2799999999997
liberal if they're just against it and

2226.32 --> 2229.44
then

2227.28 --> 2231.92
the giant amount of noise kind of

2229.44 --> 2235.28
bullies

2231.92 --> 2236.96
the subject that supposedly violated

2235.28 --> 2240.1600000000003
whatever they thought

2236.96 --> 2242.4
into submission while other things

2240.16 --> 2243.359
actually yeah they they turn it around

2242.4 --> 2246.4
they actually

2243.359 --> 2246.96
just take all limiters off and that's

2246.4 --> 2256.1600000000003
why it's

2246.96 --> 2260.2400000000002
become so chaotic and out of control

2256.16 --> 2260.24
advisory messages on albums

2260.64 --> 2262.8799999999997
right

2263.68 --> 2267.44
well it's kind of weird because even

2266.16 --> 2271.68
back then

2267.44 --> 2275.44
i was always acting in response to that

2271.68 --> 2278.3199999999997
like this is stupid why

2275.44 --> 2278.7200000000003
why do you censored artists and all that

2278.32 --> 2280.2400000000002
right

2278.72 --> 2282.16
i was like that like oh why are you

2280.24 --> 2285.04
doing that it's bad

2282.16 --> 2285.839
like oh freedom and yeah because hey my

2285.04 --> 2289.2
mother was

2285.839 --> 2292.56
just a musician into music so it's

2289.2 --> 2296.16
very logical to think like that but

2292.56 --> 2299.44
now now that it's actually kind of gone

2296.16 --> 2301.68
suddenly i understand why that was

2299.44 --> 2301.68
like

2303.04 --> 2309.119
why it wasn't bad that they at least

2306.079 --> 2312.32
tried right

2309.119 --> 2315.359
because now there is barely any kind of

2312.32 --> 2318.32
control and

2315.359 --> 2320.7999999999997
it's out of control because of it it's

2318.32 --> 2324.96
blatantly obvious there's just

2320.8 --> 2327.6800000000003
crazy satanic ideology creeping its way

2324.96 --> 2330.32
through

2327.68 --> 2332.0789999999997
that wasn't that wasn't really possible

2330.32 --> 2335.76
back then

2332.079 --> 2339.52
like to get any kind of like

2335.76 --> 2341.28
creepy satanic laced message through

2339.52 --> 2344.48
they had to

2341.28 --> 2347.119
work it in secretly get sneaky

2344.48 --> 2348.079
now they're stopping that sneakiness and

2347.119 --> 2351.28
getting more

2348.079 --> 2353.04
overtly disgusting and that's the

2351.28 --> 2355.8390000000004
difference

2353.04 --> 2355.839
right

2372.96 --> 2377.359
i missed the days when they just had to

2375.119 --> 2379.04
sneak it in

2377.359 --> 2380.839
right because then you had like ooh

2379.04 --> 2383.52
secret sneaky

2380.839 --> 2386.4
[ __ ] but that didn't just

2383.52 --> 2389.52
ram itself in your face in the preferred

2386.4 --> 2391.52
a disgusting way

2389.52 --> 2393.28
like if you would go look for it you

2391.52 --> 2396.24
would find it

2393.28 --> 2398.6400000000003
but it wasn't just constantly barraging

2396.24 --> 2401.359
you with perversion

2398.64 --> 2401.359
overtly

2402.079 --> 2411.8390000000004
big difference

2417.28 --> 2422.1600000000003
you played albums backwards all the time

2420.0 --> 2425.2
oh

2422.16 --> 2429.2
yeah i remember that

2425.2 --> 2429.2
i didn't do that myself but yeah

2431.359 --> 2437.68
that was definitely among the conspiracy

2434.4 --> 2439.839
theories from the 20th century

2437.68 --> 2441.7599999999998
that that was i think it's worked it way

2439.839 --> 2444.64
even as as like a

2441.76 --> 2445.8900000000003
sort of as a joke into cartoons and [ __ ]

2444.64 --> 2448.94
and

2445.89 --> 2448.94
[Music]

2450.839 --> 2453.839
movies

2492.839 --> 2495.839
hmm

2534.839 --> 2537.839
uh

2576.839 --> 2579.839
uh

2589.44 --> 2592.7200000000003
i'm just looking around guys

2594.18 --> 2597.3599999999997
[Music]

2618.839 --> 2621.839
so

2632.839 --> 2635.839
hmm

2648.56 --> 2654.0
yeah the guys over at flutter debate in

2650.48 --> 2654.0
skype are still talking about

2654.8 --> 2658.96
the whole ranty and cats picture

2657.599 --> 2661.599
situation and all that

2658.96 --> 2662.56
it's really started them up doing all

2661.599 --> 2665.3590000000004
that

2662.56 --> 2667.839
it's been a while hey neil casatino good

2665.359 --> 2667.839
to see you

2669.68 --> 2677.839
how are you doing monday morning

2703.76 --> 2707.119
better than yesterday okay that's good

2705.92 --> 2711.28
to hear

2707.119 --> 2712.1600000000003
yeah me too this whole weekend i was

2711.28 --> 2715.28
just really

2712.16 --> 2719.839
tense and like emotional

2715.28 --> 2719.8390000000004
tense and [ __ ]

2723.119 --> 2728.0
like in a weird way it's like in that

2726.0 --> 2730.079
way where you watch a movie there's a

2728.0 --> 2732.0
real dramatic moment and i actually

2730.079 --> 2734.7200000000003
start crying it sounds really

2732.0 --> 2734.72
silly i know

2737.04 --> 2741.44
it's just that when i'm like that i got

2739.52 --> 2744.4
a lot of feelings

2741.44 --> 2747.2000000000003
that are basically coming out of nowhere

2744.4 --> 2750.0
it always reminds me of

2747.2 --> 2750.64
certain states some women get into it's

2750.0 --> 2754.8
re that's

2750.64 --> 2754.7999999999997
weird you know because it's me it's

2755.76 --> 2759.92
but yeah then i watch movies there's

2757.599 --> 2762.319
some dramatic moments especially like

2759.92 --> 2764.8
personal realizations and all that and i

2762.319 --> 2769.359
get really emotional

2764.8 --> 2769.3590000000004
but i think it's kind of past

2769.44 --> 2775.839
i just feel a lot calmer and more

2772.16 --> 2775.839
reserved now

2779.359 --> 2783.359
all right yeah here we go again yeah

2781.119 --> 2784.96
yeah rumpus

2783.359 --> 2786.96
yeah he was certainly getting a

2784.96 --> 2792.16
treatment

2786.96 --> 2792.16
hey sleeping warrior good to see you

2794.0 --> 2800.0
i had no idea how i got yeah right you i

2800.839 --> 2803.839
heard

2804.4 --> 2808.88
well let's tell the story on are you

2806.24 --> 2811.359
sure i could call you in

2808.88 --> 2813.119
and you could tell me on this show then

2811.359 --> 2815.359
you can have the room you know

2813.119 --> 2817.44

2815.359 --> 2822.0
about it if you like

2817.44 --> 2822.0
just tell me i'll call you in on skype

2827.44 --> 2833.119
could it would be a good opportunity to

2829.839 --> 2833.119
to test my new setup

2838.4 --> 2842.48
yes living warrior yeah it's awesome

2842.88 --> 2846.88
and rumpus is really one tenacious

2845.68 --> 2850.8799999999997
bastard

2846.88 --> 2853.44
like he's not giving up like ever

2850.88 --> 2853.44
this is

2856.839 --> 2859.839
uh

2865.839 --> 2869.359
right and it's it's also funny with rump

2868.8 --> 2872.319
is like

2869.359 --> 2874.24
how he starts to stutter it's really all

2872.319 --> 2876.24
about a level of tension

2874.24 --> 2878.5589999999997
and i'm starting to figure out how that

2876.24 --> 2883.2799999999997
work how that works

2878.559 --> 2886.48
like there's like a 20 tension 50

2883.28 --> 2889.6800000000003
75 and you can hear it by how

2886.48 --> 2891.28
fast he talks how little he listens and

2889.68 --> 2894.64
how stuttery he gets

2891.28 --> 2896.6400000000003
it's like a rumpus meter like

2894.64 --> 2897.92
and at some point he's really just gonna

2896.64 --> 2901.52
buckle and get all

2897.92 --> 2903.92
flustered and [ __ ] that's like at 75

2901.52 --> 2903.92
percent

2905.839 --> 2914.0789999999997
what the i

2909.2 --> 2917.7599999999998
bully you i do this

2914.079 --> 2920.2400000000002
i do sleeping warrior what

2917.76 --> 2920.2400000000002
the [ __ ]

2924.16 --> 2929.839
hey seeking star war good to see you

2936.64 --> 2943.839
victim mode enabled what

2960.16 --> 2963.68
i mean i was a little

2963.76 --> 2968.1600000000003
grouchy in chat in the fed chat

2966.559 --> 2970.8
yesterday

2968.16 --> 2972.64
but it's also yeah because i basically

2970.8 --> 2974.8
banned perfection

2972.64 --> 2976.0789999999997
that person with the capital letters

2974.8 --> 2978.319
because

2976.079 --> 2979.599
like you've been have every time i went

2978.319 --> 2984.0
to the premiers

2979.599 --> 2988.559
it's always him or her i don't know

2984.0 --> 2991.44
and just like ugh these ballers

2988.559 --> 2991.76
it's his name again bobby steeles and

2991.44 --> 2995.599
some

2991.76 --> 2998.88
others just constantly going at it

2995.599 --> 3000.2400000000002
going at it like freaking triggered 12

2998.88 --> 3003.76
year old

3000.24 --> 3007.7599999999998
girls and just got so sick of

3003.76 --> 3010.88
like literally seeing it every day

3007.76 --> 3014.079
every day continually

3010.88 --> 3014.6400000000003
it's just at some point i just i

3014.079 --> 3017.52
couldn't

3014.64 --> 3018.4
bury him it's like that crap was

3017.52 --> 3020.0
literally just

3018.4 --> 3021.44
polluting the chat because it was

3020.0 --> 3023.76
totally lame

3021.44 --> 3024.88
totally pointless and really

3023.76 --> 3028.4
unrestrained

3024.88 --> 3031.359
restrained and stupid really dumb just

3028.4 --> 3033.119
at some point like i gotta put this out

3031.359 --> 3037.2799999999997
of the her misery his misery

3033.119 --> 3037.28
because just you gotta stop

3038.4 --> 3045.52
constant troll baiting it's really

3041.76 --> 3047.92
really embarrassing what's wrong with

3045.52 --> 3050.24
i don't know here we go again ish is

3047.92 --> 3050.64
perfection as she or is it a he i don't

3050.24 --> 3053.359
know

3050.64 --> 3054.48
certainly acts like a 12 year old girl

3053.359 --> 3056.72
so could be

3054.48 --> 3056.72
she

3058.24 --> 3061.359
and there's nothing wrong with that but

3059.839 --> 3062.72
it is there's something wrong with it

3061.359 --> 3065.7599999999998
when they just spend

3062.72 --> 3066.3999999999996
all their time all day long just troll

3065.76 --> 3070.3190000000004
baiting

3066.4 --> 3073.44
really annoying pathetic trolls

3070.319 --> 3076.96
like continually stop

3073.44 --> 3076.96
insulting 12 year old girls

3077.839 --> 3082.16
i'm not saying all 12 year old girls are

3080.319 --> 3097.839
like that but

3082.16 --> 3097.839
it's just an example

3098.48 --> 3111.839
okay sleeping warrior huh

3118.24 --> 3127.52
no here we go again it's

3124.24 --> 3127.52
don't do that

3134.8 --> 3140.8
like 12 year old boys act out

3138.4 --> 3141.599
in a very different way as 12 year old

3140.8 --> 3146.079
girls

3141.599 --> 3153.839
right this is not a time to get picky

3146.079 --> 3153.8390000000004
about this this is just

3168.16 --> 3173.359
all right yes sleeping water sounds like

3169.839 --> 3173.359
a real boomer investment

3178.16 --> 3181.839
it's a good thing you stopped him

3204.559 --> 3208.079
yes here we go again i know and when

3206.88 --> 3212.0
they act like that

3208.079 --> 3215.04
i call them [ __ ] right

3212.0 --> 3215.599
but i sometimes don't just want to

3215.04 --> 3217.52
assume

3215.599 --> 3219.119
everybody's a guy and then start calling

3217.52 --> 3221.119
them facts when they might turn out to

3219.119 --> 3224.7200000000003
be girls etc etc

3221.119 --> 3227.599
it's just an expression can you please

3224.72 --> 3228.48
not bring a new feminist revolution to

3227.599 --> 3231.2000000000003
the chat

3228.48 --> 3237.6
thank you very much here we go again

[Music]

3349.359 --> 3363.839
okay well not today then i guess too bad

right well here we go again that's

3369.359 --> 3373.119
really

3369.92 --> 3376.319
nice but the people in chat

3373.119 --> 3379.599
constantly troll baiting they don't seem

3376.319 --> 3379.599
to typically do that

3380.4 --> 3385.119
right they don't start bragging about

3383.68 --> 3387.52
their accomplishments

3385.119 --> 3388.319
in order to gain weight over the other

3387.52 --> 3392.24
they're just

3388.319 --> 3395.359
being nasty and mean-spirited

3392.24 --> 3399.1189999999997
and there's another category

3395.359 --> 3402.4
that typically does that more than just

3399.119 --> 3404.96
show off how cool they are

3402.4 --> 3406.079
that's another style right that's why i

3404.96 --> 3410.079
call it

3406.079 --> 3412.2400000000002
like a girl 12 year old right

3410.079 --> 3413.44
i didn't know you banned perfection well

3412.24 --> 3416.9599999999996
i did

3413.44 --> 3419.599
because it's just she was literally

3416.96 --> 3420.319
polluting i'm taking it is she right

3419.599 --> 3424.559
it's probably

3420.319 --> 3428.079
she she was polluting the chat terribly

3424.559 --> 3430.88
so bad that literally other people would

3428.079 --> 3432.96
no longer comment in it even though they

3430.88 --> 3436.319
were watching the show

3432.96 --> 3439.599
because it was just constantly filling

3436.319 --> 3442.72
the chat like spam

3439.599 --> 3446.319
pointless annoying embarrassing

3442.72 --> 3448.24
spam so i just said okay i'm done with

3446.319 --> 3451.04
this

3448.24 --> 3451.04
get out of here

3459.04 --> 3463.52
and oh by the way immediately after i

3462.4 --> 3466.64
did that

3463.52 --> 3469.359
a lot of people got bad like 10

3466.64 --> 3470.319
20 people got in the chat and actually

3469.359 --> 3472.48
started

3470.319 --> 3474.24
just having normal conversations and

3472.48 --> 3478.079
responding to the show

3474.24 --> 3481.359
right so immediately it proved that

3478.079 --> 3485.04
perfection is married as a man ooh okay

3481.359 --> 3485.04
well then it's even creepier

3486.839 --> 3489.839
ugh

3493.359 --> 3506.0
equal rights and equal left okay

3503.599 --> 3507.52
like no married man should ever be

3506.0 --> 3517.839
caught behaving like that

3507.52 --> 3517.839
it's really pathetic

3542.839 --> 3545.839
hmm

3552.24 --> 3559.839
perfection he went off on vegans okay

3560.16 --> 3573.839
that's weird

3582.72 --> 3587.2
well here we go again that's debatable

3584.88 --> 3590.96
i'd ask rest ahead

3587.2 --> 3593.7599999999998
he actually knows a lot about this now

3590.96 --> 3600.2400000000002
studied up and is training himself he

3593.76 --> 3602.88
gained about like 20 pounds of muscle

3600.24 --> 3605.04
right and if you go full vegan it does

3602.88 --> 3607.6800000000003
become more difficult

3605.04 --> 3607.68
to do that

3609.04 --> 3616.5589999999997
but if you just go full meat only

3612.319 --> 3616.5589999999997
that is not all good either

3617.68 --> 3629.839
i'd say

3637.44 --> 3642.48
he won't let it go though with constant

3641.2 --> 3645.68
soyboy attacks

3642.48 --> 3648.96
uh well

3645.68 --> 3651.2
look people like bobby steeles

3648.96 --> 3654.079
they're kind of like a kumu virus

3651.2 --> 3657.4399999999996
they're just yeah soy boys

3654.079 --> 3661.28
that are just being [ __ ] and just

3657.44 --> 3664.799
annoying trying to get you to hit them

3661.28 --> 3668.0
like gimps right that's why you

3664.799 --> 3670.44
don't respond to them right

3668.0 --> 3671.599
so if guys like perfection then

3670.44 --> 3674.7200000000003
immediately

3671.599 --> 3677.76
start attacking attacking it they

3674.72 --> 3678.9599999999996
literally giving these stupid little

3677.76 --> 3681.92
[ __ ] trolls

3678.96 --> 3683.44
the time of their life they're they've

3681.92 --> 3686.319
never been as active

3683.44 --> 3686.7200000000003
as they are when perfection starts doing

3686.319 --> 3691.7599999999998
that

3686.72 --> 3695.68
right and that's just stupid

3691.76 --> 3699.28
just literally feeding trolls

3695.68 --> 3701.9199999999996
head over heels effort feeding the most

3699.28 --> 3706.3190000000004
annoying trolls in chat

3701.92 --> 3706.319
and just it's got to stop that's why i

3710.839 --> 3716.16
abandoned

3712.799 --> 3719.0389999999998
only b12 is that no no here we go again

3716.16 --> 3722.24
no absolutely not that's not the only

3719.039 --> 3725.039
thing that would be missing

3722.24 --> 3725.0389999999998
that's not true

3725.68 --> 3732.799
like vegetable proteins

3729.28 --> 3736.0
are assimilated very differently

3732.799 --> 3736.72
as meat based fats and proteins it's

3736.0 --> 3739.92
different

3736.72 --> 3742.48
it's just different there's other side

3739.92 --> 3742.48
products

3742.96 --> 3746.2400000000002
it's not the same at all

3752.559 --> 3759.2000000000003
like it it yields an entirely different

3756.079 --> 3759.2000000000003
metabolic result

3775.599 --> 3782.1600000000003
yeah no but no it's not

3778.96 --> 3785.119
it's just different

3782.16 --> 3786.72
body assimilates different has different

3785.119 --> 3797.839
side products

3786.72 --> 3797.839
all kinds of things

3806.559 --> 3812.799
yes roof at st hobbins i know

3809.68 --> 3813.68
and i told him like i just like i'm sick

3812.799 --> 3816.72
of this [ __ ]

3813.68 --> 3819.44
stop acting like well a 12 year old girl

3816.72 --> 3822.48
something that apparently really offends

3819.44 --> 3825.44
here we go again when i say that

3822.48 --> 3826.079
and he just gave me lip he was just like

3825.44 --> 3828.4
oh

3826.079 --> 3830.2400000000002
so i'm gonna attack you now like you're

3828.4 --> 3833.92
one of the trolls and i'm like dude

3830.24 --> 3836.16
get a [ __ ] life man get a life

3833.92 --> 3837.76
this is terrible you're acting

3836.16 --> 3839.92
completely insane

3837.76 --> 3841.76
like if the people around you knew what

3839.92 --> 3843.92
you were doing

3841.76 --> 3845.76
well they'd probably get a divorce it's

3843.92 --> 3849.2000000000003
so unbelievably

3845.76 --> 3852.4
embarrassing like don't

3849.2 --> 3853.68
do this so it just said like yeah get

3852.4 --> 3856.319
out of here

3853.68 --> 3856.319
get a life

3864.88 --> 3868.559
plenty of builders are vegan now yeah

3867.119 --> 3870.1600000000003
sure here we go again but

3868.559 --> 3871.8390000000004
exactly you have to plan through your

3870.16 --> 3875.359
diet and not only that

3871.839 --> 3878.72
supplements laboratory quality

3875.359 --> 3882.96
supplements and yeah a lot

3878.72 --> 3885.9199999999996
it's not just oh you just eat only

3882.96 --> 3888.64
vegan regular food and then you're just

3885.92 --> 3891.119
going to be a bodybuilder there's no way

3888.64 --> 3891.1189999999997
no way

3891.68 --> 3895.839
that's you can't do that

3896.559 --> 3901.44
or that might be possible it would be

3899.599 --> 3902.799
very tough and you would have to have

3901.44 --> 3906.839
like physical

3902.799 --> 3909.839
disposition to be able to do that

3906.839 --> 3909.839
naturally

3911.11 --> 3916.619
[Music]

3935.44 --> 3942.16
and some also some people metabolism

3938.48 --> 3942.16
respond better yes that's correct

3947.039 --> 3955.119
but i would

3950.96 --> 3959.119
i would express that differently

3955.119 --> 3963.119
it's rather that some peoples

3959.119 --> 3966.4
some tribes some local

3963.119 --> 3969.52
groups respond

3966.4 --> 3972.319
better to meat and less

3969.52 --> 3973.0389999999998
efficient to meat it's really because

3972.319 --> 3977.44
most people

3973.039 --> 3980.88
respond the same to vegetable

3977.44 --> 3983.52
to greens right most people respond

3980.88 --> 3984.48
the same to that it's just that there's

3983.52 --> 3987.28
groups that have

3984.48 --> 3989.2
kind of intolerance to meet and then

3987.28 --> 3991.3590000000004
there's groups that have

3989.2 --> 3995.52
much less intolerance to me that

3991.359 --> 3999.0389999999998
actually assimilated very effectively

3995.52 --> 4007.839
so it's more about how much do they

3999.039 --> 4007.8390000000004
have side effects from meat

4011.92 --> 4015.839
ah that's good to hear clutch bear yeah

4013.76 --> 4020.2400000000002
yeah

4015.839 --> 4022.799
yeah cheap meat is is really bad

4020.24 --> 4023.2799999999997
i would never i'm never ever again

4022.799 --> 4025.359
eating

4023.28 --> 4028.7200000000003
non-organic meat just not doing it i'd

4025.359 --> 4028.72
rather just eat nothing

4029.2 --> 4035.839
hey dutch sailor good to see you

4064.96 --> 4070.799
hey stash moretz you eat everything okay

4074.079 --> 4078.7200000000003
all right yes ralph rodriguez i

4076.319 --> 4081.839
definitely eat eggs

4078.72 --> 4084.9599999999996
although i have some there's sometimes i

4081.839 --> 4087.359
i digest them less

4084.96 --> 4089.28
well as other times it's weird like

4087.359 --> 4091.2
sometimes it's like it doesn't

4089.28 --> 4093.2000000000003
i eat it pretty much every day and

4091.2 --> 4094.799
sometimes it's like ah i don't really

4093.2 --> 4096.48
want to eat it it's weird

4094.799 --> 4098.239
and other times it's just like yeah of

4096.48 --> 4102.48
course i'm gonna eat that

4098.239 --> 4102.48
it goes up and down periodically

4103.12 --> 4110.799
uh but fish oil i definitely

4107.759 --> 4112.799
do my best to take that every day it

4110.799 --> 4119.839
really works well i assimilate it

4112.799 --> 4119.839
very effectively

4127.839 --> 4135.2789999999995
rice and beans yeah sure

4132.64 --> 4135.279
that can work

4143.279 --> 4147.040000000001
hmm all right it's that's right that

4146.08 --> 4150.799
sounds like a

4147.04 --> 4154.239
sensible balanced diet

4150.799 --> 4158.64
with me it's

4154.239 --> 4162.4
roughly half the time i eat meat

4158.64 --> 4166.08
like in a dinner and it's almost like

4162.4 --> 4166.08
my body just kind of

4166.239 --> 4170.3189999999995
bypasses even my consciousness in

4168.319 --> 4171.279
deciding when i'm gonna eat meat and not

4170.319 --> 4175.120000000001
because sometimes

4171.279 --> 4177.92
i just i know like yeah on the menu

4175.12 --> 4179.759
is this thing that has meat in it of

4177.92 --> 4182.4800000000005
course it has

4179.759 --> 4184.08
and then my body's like nope you're not

4182.48 --> 4188.639999999999
gonna have dinner

4184.08 --> 4190.799
like what okay and can like postpone

4188.64 --> 4194.08
dinner for up to two days and then i

4190.799 --> 4196.8
effectively only eat vegetarian

4194.08 --> 4199.04
it's like my body just decides like nope

4196.8 --> 4202.88
you're not gonna eat meat every day

4199.04 --> 4205.36
it's it's kind of rare that i eat meat

4202.88 --> 4206.08
two days in a row it's really become

4205.36 --> 4209.36
rare and

4206.08 --> 4211.76
i don't really understand

4209.36 --> 4216.88
it's not a conscious decision it just

4211.76 --> 4219.6
seems to happen

4216.88 --> 4221.84
like i've had like chicken broccoli

4219.6 --> 4223.92
standing by

4221.84 --> 4225.360000000001
and i've been postponing it for two days

4223.92 --> 4228.08
now and i'm really

4225.36 --> 4229.759999999999
thinking like dude i gotta eat this or

4228.08 --> 4230.0
yeah it's gonna spoil that's going to be

4229.76 --> 4245.84
one

4230.0 --> 4245.84
hell of a waste so

4255.85 --> 4258.9490000000005
[Music]

4284.84 --> 4287.84
what

4292.96 --> 4296.719
during world war ii people were still

4295.76 --> 4301.84
healthy

4296.719 --> 4301.84
healthier than

4316.88 --> 4331.679
i don't know about that here we go again

4328.4 --> 4331.679
don't know if that relates

4331.84 --> 4336.32
to the scarcity of meat i don't think so

4338.719 --> 4346.4
i think that overall before that

4343.52 --> 4347.679
people were healthier because i think

4346.4 --> 4349.639999999999
that after that period

4347.679 --> 4352.0
is really when like the

4349.64 --> 4353.12
industrialization of farming started and

4352.0 --> 4359.04
all that

4353.12 --> 4359.04
and was made into a system to basically

4359.199 --> 4365.599999999999
replace just healthy

4362.56 --> 4368.8
organically grown food with like

4365.6 --> 4370.4800000000005
rushed hurried cheap

4368.8 --> 4372.159000000001
replacements and all that right that's

4370.48 --> 4373.28
when the industrialization of food

4372.159 --> 4375.679
industry

4373.28 --> 4376.8
really started to get going and i think

4375.679 --> 4378.4800000000005
that that

4376.8 --> 4382.84
more than anything has really

4378.48 --> 4385.759999999999
contributed to the degradation of health

4382.84 --> 4388.8
worldwide so stepping away from

4385.76 --> 4391.04
traditional farming

4388.8 --> 4391.04
right

4392.08 --> 4395.5199999999995
and i'm not talking about how to treat

4393.92 --> 4398.8
the land because there's been

4395.52 --> 4400.320000000001
like classical farming has had many

4398.8 --> 4402.56
issues we're just

4400.32 --> 4405.04
tilling the land constantly is actually

4402.56 --> 4409.6
not good for the land etc

4405.04 --> 4412.8
but like rather what are you gonna feed

4409.6 --> 4414.88
your cattle and all that

4412.8 --> 4417.1990000000005
and are you going to use pesticides well

4414.88 --> 4417.1990000000005
no

4417.44 --> 4421.36
etc etc there were just a lot more

4420.56 --> 4427.84
pesticides

4421.36 --> 4427.839999999999
getting involved in 20th century

4434.719 --> 4440.2390000000005
right then degeneration of health also

4437.6 --> 4442.8
the rockefeller medicine yes

4440.239 --> 4445.28
that too happened they basically took

4442.8 --> 4449.92
over just

4445.28 --> 4455.5199999999995
the the classical small pharma

4449.92 --> 4457.679
just the the original grocery pharma

4455.52 --> 4459.4400000000005
where they just had their own study and

4457.679 --> 4462.56
all kinds of

4459.44 --> 4463.28
remedies for ailments that have been

4462.56 --> 4466.4800000000005
used for

4463.28 --> 4467.04
like hundreds of years and then it was

4466.48 --> 4470.159
all

4467.04 --> 4471.84
uniform made uniform into a medical

4470.159 --> 4475.759999999999
system

4471.84 --> 4479.1990000000005
and basically replaced of really

4475.76 --> 4482.159000000001
good old tricks with standardized

4479.199 --> 4484.32
systems that are not great introduction

4482.159 --> 4484.32
of

4485.52 --> 4488.320000000001
it's called again

4494.84 --> 4498.96
dammit yeah the standardized antibiotics

4498.32 --> 4502.159
and all that

4498.96 --> 4506.0
garbage that's

4502.159 --> 4506.719
not done a lot of good it seemed to at

4506.0 --> 4510.159
first but

4506.719 --> 4525.84
eventually yeah

4510.159 --> 4525.839999999999
it probably did more harm

4533.76 --> 4539.84
all right i'm gonna give some wrenches

4535.44 --> 4539.839999999999
here let's see you for a while now

4583.08 --> 4589.04
interferom what's that

4587.04 --> 4590.8
i've heard of that or well i kind of

4589.04 --> 4594.0
have heard about it but i don't i don't

4590.8 --> 4597.12
know what it is

4594.0 --> 4599.36
recommended daily allowances are all

4597.12 --> 4602.5599999999995
false

4599.36 --> 4603.12
what oh right yeah the that standardized

4602.56 --> 4608.159000000001
food pair

4603.12 --> 4612.5599999999995
is complete garbage

4608.159 --> 4615.28
like that daily allowance and all that

4612.56 --> 4616.2390000000005
is based on like prisoner maintenance

4615.28 --> 4620.159
maintenance

4616.239 --> 4624.799999999999
serious that's what it's based on

4620.159 --> 4627.12
so how to let somebody not starve

4624.8 --> 4628.88
right but it doesn't actually optimize

4627.12 --> 4633.28
anything it doesn't really

4628.88 --> 4633.28
help them and it's not balanced not

4634.84 --> 4637.84
really

4638.88 --> 4643.52
because the way you assimilate food that

4642.88 --> 4647.28
differs

4643.52 --> 4649.6
per person also based on their

4647.28 --> 4651.84
well genetic pool background and all

4649.6 --> 4651.84
that

4653.52 --> 4656.64
so what however you're going to eat you

4655.76 --> 4660.0
should always

4656.64 --> 4662.0
adapt it to just how your specific body

4660.0 --> 4663.12
body metabolism works and you need to

4662.0 --> 4666.0
figure that out

4663.12 --> 4666.8
during your life be helpful if like your

4666.0 --> 4670.08
family had

4666.8 --> 4679.84
always already gotten

4670.08 --> 4679.84
that input to cross-reference

4710.8 --> 4718.0
okay clutch bear potato and butter

4714.48 --> 4718.0
all the nutrients you need to survive

4718.84 --> 4723.1990000000005
well

4720.159 --> 4723.679
you i don't know maybe you could survive

4723.199 --> 4726.719
on that

4723.679 --> 4729.92
for quite a while although

4726.719 --> 4729.92
i probably need

4730.64 --> 4737.280000000001
more protein beside that

4734.48 --> 4737.759999999999
but yes especially if you have really

4737.28 --> 4740.88
good

4737.76 --> 4743.679
great high quality organic butter that

4740.88 --> 4747.1990000000005
contains a lot of good stuff

4743.679 --> 4751.36
and yeah potatoes are great too

4747.199 --> 4754.159
like i eat potatoes almost daily

4751.36 --> 4757.759999999999
through french fries and yeah that

4754.159 --> 4757.759999999999
french fries made in olive oil

4759.36 --> 4765.759999999999
it works out great for me right

4762.96 --> 4766.8
don't get cheap fred or well not you i

4765.76 --> 4770.0
don't get

4766.8 --> 4772.159000000001
regular french fries at some snack bar

4770.0 --> 4773.84
or whatever i used to do that well

4772.159 --> 4777.199
that's not very good

4773.84 --> 4791.84
right i make it myself and that's

4777.199 --> 4791.839999999999
just a lot better

4804.88 --> 4819.84
boil the mesh and put them in the stew

4834.56 --> 4840.400000000001
oh by the way have have any of you heard

4837.199 --> 4840.4
that there's like this

4842.0 --> 4849.76
did i freaking dream that no

4845.28 --> 4851.84
not it couldn't be also seen it

4849.76 --> 4855.1990000000005
apparently there's this new lord of the

4851.84 --> 4855.1990000000005
rings project going

4855.76 --> 4861.84
and i think i read it on rt let's see if

4859.199 --> 4866.0
it's still there

4861.84 --> 4869.92
like it's going to be the most expensive

4866.0 --> 4875.84
movie project ever put together

4869.92 --> 4875.84
it's insane

4883.84 --> 4892.719
yeah from amazon prices tv show

4887.679 --> 4895.76
ever made spending 250 million

4892.719 --> 4895.76
on the rights alone

4896.88 --> 4902.56
plus hundreds of millions more for

4898.8 --> 4904.639
filming each season

4902.56 --> 4907.6
so there's apparently a series of lord

4904.639 --> 4907.6
of the rings coming

4911.44 --> 4917.839999999999
right let me put the link in chat so you

4913.6 --> 4917.84
can take a look yourself

4935.92 --> 4941.52
oh really i well super straight after

4938.0 --> 4941.52
hello by the way i wouldn't call that

4942.84 --> 4945.84
surviving

4953.6 --> 4957.52
uh no classical homeopath i don't care

4956.4 --> 4960.48
if they edited

4957.52 --> 4964.56
that in last last minute then i hope

4960.48 --> 4967.759999999999
that whoever was responsible for that

4964.56 --> 4971.6
basically suffers a

4967.76 --> 4973.280000000001
punishing degeneration over time

4971.6 --> 4975.84
because they that would mean they've

4973.28 --> 4987.84
mutilated just the legacy

4975.84 --> 4987.84
that's pretty disgusting

4989.199 --> 4992.96
i hope they don't game of thrones the

4991.199 --> 4994.159
new lord well i don't even know what

4992.96 --> 4996.08
it's going to be about

4994.159 --> 4997.199
if it's going to be like post lord of

4996.08 --> 5000.5599999999995
the rings

4997.199 --> 5003.04
like after it all like what comes after

5000.56 --> 5004.8
i don't i have no idea what it's gonna

5003.04 --> 5007.36
be like it's a series but i don't know

5004.8 --> 5007.360000000001
about what

5008.239 --> 5018.159
the gods change the shape in the story

5012.84 --> 5018.159000000001
what you mean in the silmarillion

5021.44 --> 5029.839999999999
pre oh so it's the prequel

5025.52 --> 5029.84
oh goody well whatever

5035.04 --> 5039.6
don't cop up the ending it was that's

5037.12 --> 5042.48
more that seems extremely unlikely since

5039.6 --> 5043.120000000001
apparently it is going to be a prequel

5042.48 --> 5045.28
right

5043.12 --> 5046.239
and game of thrones was basically a

5045.28 --> 5049.84
completely

5046.239 --> 5053.599999999999
new story universe

5049.84 --> 5054.639
it was new it was this movie was made by

5053.6 --> 5057.6
the writer

5054.639 --> 5060.159000000001
literally right so yeah he has the

5057.6 --> 5061.1990000000005
liberty to screw it up the way he wants

5060.159 --> 5064.48
to

5061.199 --> 5067.44
this is based on the story world

5064.48 --> 5070.159
of somebody that has already died and

5067.44 --> 5074.5599999999995
that's been so widely established

5070.159 --> 5074.5599999999995
like no they could never do that

5074.639 --> 5081.92
because yeah they just can't do that

5078.4 --> 5084.239
they don't have the liberty to screw up

5081.92 --> 5087.36
their own

5084.239 --> 5090.32
grandfather's work like that

5087.36 --> 5092.159
the storyline is set they can't do that

5090.32 --> 5096.5599999999995
they just can't do that

5092.159 --> 5097.839999999999
done they don't have the liberty to

5096.56 --> 5100.56
screw it up like that

5097.84 --> 5101.6
because they are not the original story

5100.56 --> 5105.52
world writer

5101.6 --> 5113.84
you see they're just the legacy keepers

5105.52 --> 5113.84
of it

5119.84 --> 5123.6
and if they do do it anyway well then

5122.96 --> 5127.28
they are

5123.6 --> 5128.159000000001
literally just shooting tolkien's feet

5127.28 --> 5130.88
off

5128.159 --> 5131.28
in his grave no less right if they're

5130.88 --> 5134.400000000001
gonna

5131.28 --> 5136.32
absolutely destroy it all then yeah

5134.4 --> 5139.12
they could do that it would make

5136.32 --> 5141.5199999999995
absolutely no sense though

5139.12 --> 5142.32
because they got their little monopoly

5141.52 --> 5144.56
position

5142.32 --> 5146.159
their copyrights and if they're just

5144.56 --> 5148.2390000000005
gonna wreck it all

5146.159 --> 5150.08
then all of that would be for nothing

5148.239 --> 5150.638999999999
because everybody's gonna lose interest

5150.08 --> 5152.48
because

5150.639 --> 5153.679
literally they just destroyed their own

5152.48 --> 5159.12
franchise

5153.679 --> 5161.04
right so very unlikely

5159.12 --> 5162.719
the amounts of money being thrown down

5161.04 --> 5164.88
you think they're going to screw it up

5162.719 --> 5169.12
like that on purpose

5164.88 --> 5171.4400000000005
that would be insane

5169.12 --> 5183.84
and maybe they are insane i don't know i

5171.44 --> 5183.839999999999
have no idea

5188.58 --> 5191.739
[Music]

5194.84 --> 5197.84
so

5204.8 --> 5208.88
by the way i don't even see what was so

5206.96 --> 5210.32
terrible about the ending of game of

5208.88 --> 5212.96
thrones

5210.32 --> 5215.84
that wasn't as terrible as the rest of

5212.96 --> 5218.159
the entire series

5215.84 --> 5219.12
like the entire series was pretty

5218.159 --> 5223.44
terrible

5219.12 --> 5225.76
that was the gig that was what it was

5223.44 --> 5226.879999999999
that it's terrible that their leaders

5225.76 --> 5230.08
are absolutely

5226.88 --> 5233.6
horrific psychopaths that was

5230.08 --> 5236.639
the point of the entire series

5233.6 --> 5240.08
and how well they put it down how

5236.639 --> 5243.6
just unscathed like raw they did that

5240.08 --> 5244.8
yeah that was the point of the game of

5243.6 --> 5247.52
thrones

5244.8 --> 5251.04
grammar throws it up well it's the game

5247.52 --> 5255.040000000001
of thrones it didn't end horribly

5251.04 --> 5256.96
it was just going to happen like that

5255.04 --> 5258.4
because the whole point was is that

5256.96 --> 5262.32
pretty much

5258.4 --> 5262.719
everybody dies especially the ones you

5262.32 --> 5265.12
like

5262.719 --> 5266.08
that was the whole point that was the

5265.12 --> 5267.679
entire series

5266.08 --> 5269.5199999999995
and then you're gonna complain it didn't

5267.679 --> 5272.8
end perfectly right are you

5269.52 --> 5275.679
are you for real you're lucky

5272.8 --> 5277.84
anybody survived in that series anybody

5275.679 --> 5277.84
at

5278.84 --> 5281.84
all

5283.44 --> 5287.759999999999
oh they rushed to the end did they

5289.12 --> 5295.84
did they rush the end

5296.159 --> 5299.36
i don't see that like what are they

5298.239 --> 5302.4
gonna do just

5299.36 --> 5305.5199999999995
make it two episodes longer put more

5302.4 --> 5308.4
stuff on top of that it

5305.52 --> 5309.360000000001
just crashed because it was always going

5308.4 --> 5312.4
to crash

5309.36 --> 5313.5199999999995
the situation didn't get cut short it

5312.4 --> 5316.879999999999
crashed

5313.52 --> 5320.84
because it was always going to do that

5316.88 --> 5324.2390000000005
it's part of the series it's part of

5320.84 --> 5328.0
showing what these rulers are

5324.239 --> 5330.638999999999
is the point of it didn't get cut short

5328.0 --> 5331.36
it crashed because it was always going

5330.639 --> 5335.36
to crash

5331.36 --> 5339.94
like that stories like that don't

5335.36 --> 5341.679
end smoothly and they shouldn't

5339.94 --> 5344.32
[Music]

5341.679 --> 5345.36
they altered from the book oh i don't

5344.32 --> 5347.92
know man

5345.36 --> 5348.719
i don't know if that's the case sure

5347.92 --> 5353.12
whatever

5348.719 --> 5353.12
i haven't read the books at all ugh

5354.0 --> 5357.12
hello miss crazy ad

5360.47 --> 5366.8
[Music]

5363.199 --> 5368.08
right well look maybe yeah maybe they

5366.8 --> 5370.400000000001
did cut it a little short

5368.08 --> 5373.76
[Music]

5370.4 --> 5377.199
but i take it they did it with

5373.76 --> 5379.52
permission of the writer i take it right

5377.199 --> 5381.44
it's not like oh we we don't have enough

5379.52 --> 5384.88
budget the

5381.44 --> 5388.96
the highest paying series ever

5384.88 --> 5393.6
so if yeah if you're gonna blame anybody

5388.96 --> 5396.639
blame the story writer he directed it

5393.6 --> 5407.84
he changed the ending of

5396.639 --> 5407.84
how he read it wrote it himself so

5407.92 --> 5412.08
those coin is up for this i don't know

5412.4 --> 5421.839999999999
i'm not into that

5430.0 --> 5435.84
no there wasn't

5440.239 --> 5448.959999999999
i have no idea what you're talking about

5442.4 --> 5453.12
it's all clear skies

5448.96 --> 5453.12
the author wanted more seasons did he

5454.56 --> 5459.120000000001
why was it caught short then okay so hey

5457.28 --> 5463.75
maybe i was wrong maybe he didn't have

5459.12 --> 5466.849999999999
as much control as i thought he did

5463.75 --> 5466.85
[Music]

5486.56 --> 5491.84
it's all gay anyway

5494.88 --> 5497.28
wow

5498.159 --> 5504.799999999999
so they just gave up on it

5501.199 --> 5508.32
that was stupid then

5504.8 --> 5508.320000000001
i bet they're sorry now

5515.199 --> 5519.839999999999
like what other projects

5544.48 --> 5547.5199999999995
right so they basically got grappled out

5547.12 --> 5550.88
of

5547.52 --> 5552.88
a really good thing they were on a roll

5550.88 --> 5554.639
they were making a huge momentum and

5552.88 --> 5556.400000000001
then all the grabbers came like oh

5554.639 --> 5560.0
please you're so good you're so good if

5556.4 --> 5562.0
i can only have you for my new project

5560.0 --> 5564.8
and they basically fell for it so that

5562.0 --> 5567.44
seems like what happened then

5564.8 --> 5570.0
that's typical so they let themselves

5567.44 --> 5572.96
get grabble then

5570.0 --> 5575.12
in stopping something that was really

5572.96 --> 5577.6
record level successful

5575.12 --> 5577.599999999999
typical

5578.56 --> 5589.84
how corruptable people are right

5614.84 --> 5617.84
hmm

5637.679 --> 5641.6
right but it's kind of weird how that

5639.92 --> 5643.76
works you know i guess

5641.6 --> 5646.639
now that i'm thinking about it more

5643.76 --> 5646.639
complete data

5647.679 --> 5651.1990000000005
it is kind of typical that

5651.679 --> 5657.28
if people are working on a project

5654.96 --> 5659.52
and it's just like nah it's okay or

5657.28 --> 5662.32
whatever or it's it's shitty

5659.52 --> 5665.679
like nobody cares nobody's gonna

5662.32 --> 5668.799999999999
approach these people and say like oh

5665.679 --> 5670.4800000000005
oh will you do my project please please

5668.8 --> 5673.679
please it's so good this

5670.48 --> 5676.799999999999
oh you're so good for doing this i want

5673.679 --> 5677.84
this power so please work for me and buy

5676.8 --> 5681.04
them out right

5677.84 --> 5683.84
so if yeah if you're just

5681.04 --> 5685.04
doing a math project nobody's going to

5683.84 --> 5687.6
grapple that

5685.04 --> 5688.88
but if you're like onto a formula and it

5687.6 --> 5691.92
really started

5688.88 --> 5694.96
starts to buzz and like hit

5691.92 --> 5697.6
mainstream attention like crazy

5694.96 --> 5698.2390000000005
then all the grabblers are gonna come at

5697.6 --> 5700.4800000000005
you

5698.239 --> 5703.28
like success means you're going to be

5700.48 --> 5707.28
swarmed by grabblers trying to pull you

5703.28 --> 5709.28
away from the success literally

5707.28 --> 5710.639
and they don't even realize that they're

5709.28 --> 5713.119
literally

5710.639 --> 5714.08
seducing you to destroy something that's

5713.119 --> 5715.36
good

5714.08 --> 5718.32
they don't even know they're doing it

5715.36 --> 5721.759999999999
they're just completely blinded by greed

5718.32 --> 5724.639
when that happens it's very typical

5721.76 --> 5726.2390000000005
because if you're in a meh project

5724.639 --> 5729.119
that's not going to happen

5726.239 --> 5730.638999999999
even though you might be very skilled if

5729.119 --> 5733.679
the thing you're working on

5730.639 --> 5734.56
doesn't hit that super peak note that

5733.679 --> 5737.84
just

5734.56 --> 5739.6
makes it explode in popularity

5737.84 --> 5742.0
then yeah they're just going to be left

5739.6 --> 5744.400000000001
to do that and even afterward

5742.0 --> 5745.44
might turn out that that project that

5744.4 --> 5748.08
was received

5745.44 --> 5750.08
meh at first will turn out to be like a

5748.08 --> 5751.679
classic that everybody loves and keeps

5750.08 --> 5753.76
watching back

5751.679 --> 5755.52
or if you're like in a super super

5753.76 --> 5758.88
popular series that's like

5755.52 --> 5760.4800000000005
hitting mainstream attention like crazy

5758.88 --> 5761.76
yeah you're gonna be swarmed by

5760.48 --> 5764.159
grabblers trying to

5761.76 --> 5767.119000000001
bribe you out of it literally to break

5764.159 --> 5770.4
down the light like this is too popular

5767.119 --> 5772.88
this is too popular not to try to

5770.4 --> 5774.159
bribe and bury people under money

5772.88 --> 5779.28
promises and [ __ ]

5774.159 --> 5782.159
to make it stop like it's too successful

5779.28 --> 5782.96
make it stop try to bribe them out of it

5782.159 --> 5785.119
to do

5782.96 --> 5787.28
something else that of course will turn

5785.119 --> 5799.839999999999
out to be a pretty shitty project

5787.28 --> 5799.84
right it's just the natural result

5819.199 --> 5823.04
it's ridiculous it's really ridiculous

5821.679 --> 5827.1990000000005
that it works this way it

5823.04 --> 5830.8
is it's stupid

5827.199 --> 5833.5199999999995
because yeah it means that there's just

5830.8 --> 5835.4400000000005
potentially really expensive and good

5833.52 --> 5839.280000000001
things being made and just

5835.44 --> 5843.04
effectively others competitors

5839.28 --> 5846.4
literally trying to just destroy that

5843.04 --> 5850.32
to ruin good things

5846.4 --> 5853.599999999999
it's all spite and jealousy

5850.32 --> 5854.08
grapplers pure grabbler hell like

5853.6 --> 5856.2390000000005
nothing

5854.08 --> 5859.119
good comes out of it because when it

5856.239 --> 5862.959999999999
does it's immediately attacked

5859.119 --> 5868.239
covertly to stop it to ruin it

5862.96 --> 5870.639
to supplant it it's terrible it's

5868.239 --> 5870.638999999999
terrible

5872.8 --> 5877.84
anyway i'm very glad i didn't get yeah i

5876.159 --> 5883.839999999999
wasn't gay enough to

5877.84 --> 5883.84
get with hollywood or something

5886.56 --> 5891.879000000001
i never went for that

5888.8 --> 5891.879
[Music]

5893.6 --> 5897.6
man i would probably have ended up like

5895.679 --> 5900.96
some creepy villain

5897.6 --> 5904.2390000000005
stereotype guy anyway

5900.96 --> 5906.719
i do have it in me it's

5904.239 --> 5907.36
can be pretty damn intimidating so yeah

5906.719 --> 5909.44
i

5907.36 --> 5911.04
i would have probably ended up like just

5909.44 --> 5916.719
another standard villain

5911.04 --> 5921.6
guy is that really what i want to be

5916.719 --> 5921.6
to be known as like a creepy villain guy

5922.84 --> 5925.84
ugh

5947.36 --> 5950.96
they're all bad you know man i said i've

5949.92 --> 5953.28
thought about it

5950.96 --> 5954.32
quite a few you know i i really when i

5953.28 --> 5956.88
was younger

5954.32 --> 5958.639
i really did wanted to to become an

5956.88 --> 5961.1990000000005
actor

5958.639 --> 5963.84
before i figured out they're all gay and

5961.199 --> 5968.48
they're all completely insane

5963.84 --> 5968.4800000000005
satanic virtue signaling out of control

5968.8 --> 5975.84
like disgusting literally just

5973.199 --> 5976.32
i have very fine-tuned senses that i

5975.84 --> 5981.119000000001
even

5976.32 --> 5984.4
use in acting and analysis and all that

5981.119 --> 5987.839999999999
they burn that they literally just

5984.4 --> 5988.879999999999
burn that off you they burn your senses

5987.84 --> 5993.28
away

5988.88 --> 5993.28
yeah bobby steals gay and insane

5993.36 --> 5997.759999999999
what you feel i'm talking about you very

6006.84 --> 6009.84
telling

6032.4 --> 6035.5199999999995
oh wow bobby steele actually agrees with

6035.119 --> 6039.599999999999
me

6035.52 --> 6040.639
hmm all right that doesn't make you less

6039.6 --> 6044.56
gay though but

6040.639 --> 6046.719
whatever uh wow super straight earthy

6044.56 --> 6050.159000000001
i've heard about that [ __ ]

6046.719 --> 6051.92
and and even outside of hollywood that

6050.159 --> 6056.4
crap happens

6051.92 --> 6056.4
like mega corporations do that too

6058.08 --> 6062.48
like really good programmers that are

6060.639 --> 6066.8
like extremely talented

6062.48 --> 6071.36
they get stolen they'll just

6066.8 --> 6071.360000000001
graft them right out of the company

6071.52 --> 6075.4400000000005
that [ __ ] that [ __ ] even happens outside

6074.4 --> 6079.839999999999
of hollywood that

6075.44 --> 6079.839999999999
yeah messed up

6084.639 --> 6093.84
yeah clutch bear that would be cool

6104.84 --> 6107.84
hmm

6137.28 --> 6140.99
get a girlfriend used to work for a

6138.96 --> 6144.01
called corn fairy

6140.99 --> 6144.01
[Music]

6146.84 --> 6149.84
huh

6174.84 --> 6178.4800000000005
right weird

6181.28 --> 6184.639
it's weird how that works

6186.75 --> 6191.36
[Music]

6189.04 --> 6193.199
i'm just pondering like should there be

6191.36 --> 6194.159
regulations for that to basically

6193.199 --> 6197.678999999999
prevent that

6194.159 --> 6202.48
from well

6197.679 --> 6202.4800000000005
constantly sabotaging things out there

6202.8 --> 6205.92
through big money because that means if

6204.639 --> 6207.679
you have enough money you could

6205.92 --> 6211.1990000000005
literally just break apart

6207.679 --> 6213.679
companies if they're not in line with

6211.199 --> 6218.32
what you want

6213.679 --> 6223.4400000000005
just by throwing money at key

6218.32 --> 6223.44
key employees employees

6230.84 --> 6233.84
right

6247.6 --> 6261.84
okay super straight after sure dude

6250.88 --> 6261.84
it's your girlfriend who worked there

6267.6 --> 6271.92
yeah come on guys there's quite a lot of

6270.159 --> 6275.199
people in chat here

6271.92 --> 6277.6
hit the thumbs up come on

6275.199 --> 6277.599999999999
do it

6284.08 --> 6294.4
ah see knew it

6290.08 --> 6294.4
the whole freaking thing is artificial

6294.639 --> 6303.84
ah but it is working though cool

6307.44 --> 6311.44
yes sleeping warrior i know

6314.159 --> 6319.119
they love thinking of things like

6317.28 --> 6322.5599999999995
they're in the right they love it

6319.119 --> 6331.04
ah see see it's artificial

6322.56 --> 6345.84
there aren't any people doing that

6331.04 --> 6345.84
what do you mean michael b

6361.84 --> 6368.08
all right thanks

6365.84 --> 6369.84
but yeah it seems like the troll or

6368.08 --> 6371.76
troll i don't even know if it's a troll

6369.84 --> 6373.04
it seems like there's an automatic

6371.76 --> 6376.639
mechanism

6373.04 --> 6379.84
that's not individuals doing that [ __ ]

6376.639 --> 6380.159000000001
it's not individuals immediately evening

6379.84 --> 6383.679
up

6380.159 --> 6387.44
the thumbs up immediately right

6383.679 --> 6389.679
went up like four five and immediately

6387.44 --> 6392.96
the thumbs down went up

6389.679 --> 6398.8
to equal it immediately that's not

6392.96 --> 6398.8
people that's a mechanism doing that

6398.84 --> 6401.84
[ __ ]

6426.639 --> 6432.4800000000005
what you're doing you're giving it a

6428.32 --> 6432.48
thumbs down are you are you doing that

6437.6 --> 6443.52
or are you giving me a thumbs up bobby

6439.52 --> 6447.1990000000005
steals i would imagine you would

6443.52 --> 6448.159000000001
because you're i at least recognize you

6447.199 --> 6456.0
as a person

6448.159 --> 6470.96
right i give you legitimate criticism

6456.0 --> 6473.6
[ __ ] yourself dude

6470.96 --> 6474.96
it doesn't actually mat no but it's it

6473.6 --> 6477.52
does in a way

6474.96 --> 6480.0
you know it's weird because i get more

6477.52 --> 6484.2390000000005
thumbs down

6480.0 --> 6488.96
than nathan oakley shows

6484.239 --> 6488.959999999999
right tell me how that's consistent

6493.92 --> 6501.28
am i such a terrible

6496.96 --> 6504.719
evil influence on the ballers i'm

6501.28 --> 6506.96
so mean i constantly do

6504.719 --> 6508.32
mean things towards baller oh wait no

6506.96 --> 6511.199
i'm actually

6508.32 --> 6512.08
kind of the the flat earth guy that says

6511.199 --> 6515.199
yeah i believe

6512.08 --> 6518.239
in the dual cosmogonical society right

6515.199 --> 6521.599999999999
yeah oh that means immediately

6518.239 --> 6524.718999999999
auto down thumb auto down thumb

6521.6 --> 6527.4400000000005
keep yeah right nathan oakley and hey

6524.719 --> 6528.0
nathan oakley is ace i love the guy he's

6527.44 --> 6529.919999999999
awesome

6528.0 --> 6531.04
i like how he teabags ballers that

6529.92 --> 6533.36
deserve it

6531.04 --> 6534.4
right he's not getting this treatment

6533.36 --> 6537.759999999999
now i'm

6534.4 --> 6541.04
getting this treatment because hey

6537.76 --> 6543.04
i'm like halfway neutral actually saying

6541.04 --> 6544.08
well maybe there is something about the

6543.04 --> 6547.44
ball

6544.08 --> 6549.5199999999995
earth like a challenge dream that you

6547.44 --> 6551.678999999999
can overcome it could be a part of the

6549.52 --> 6554.88
long-term society

6551.679 --> 6555.92
as long as it's controlled and not the

6554.88 --> 6560.0
feeding

6555.92 --> 6562.0
trough for slaves controlled by a bunch

6560.0 --> 6564.08
of psychopaths that are literally just

6562.0 --> 6567.84
wanting the extermination of all

6564.08 --> 6570.239
living things right i envision a dual

6567.84 --> 6571.4400000000005
cosmogonical society but apparently that

6570.239 --> 6574.32
means

6571.44 --> 6576.159
that absolutely i can never have more

6574.32 --> 6583.84
upvotes than downvotes

6576.159 --> 6583.839999999999
now makes so much sense

6592.159 --> 6597.839999999999
what are you talking about dave johnson

6594.239 --> 6597.839999999999
that's nonsense

6598.56 --> 6606.0
yeah i know they are it's just that

6602.48 --> 6608.08
how is this how is this mechanically

6606.0 --> 6610.96
possible

6608.08 --> 6612.4
right that's the part where i'm like

6610.96 --> 6616.08
basically complaining

6612.4 --> 6619.199
to the corporation the corporation

6616.08 --> 6620.08
that i work for google youtube that

6619.199 --> 6623.5199999999995
provides me

6620.08 --> 6625.119
the platform to work with how is this

6623.52 --> 6628.080000000001
possible

6625.119 --> 6629.199
you tell me google how is this possible

6628.08 --> 6632.4
how can this

6629.199 --> 6635.598999999999
work like that because

6632.4 --> 6637.759999999999
i am being bullied right yeah i'm

6635.599 --> 6640.56
i'm a victim i'm a victim right i am

6637.76 --> 6640.56
being bullied

6640.719 --> 6647.04
consistently for years

6643.84 --> 6648.2390000000005
and you've done nothing you've done

6647.04 --> 6650.96
nothing about it

6648.239 --> 6653.839999999999
absolutely nothing i don't know what to

6650.96 --> 6653.84
do about it

6654.0 --> 6659.92
right but yeah you

6657.199 --> 6662.638999999999
have provided the mechanism that allows

6659.92 --> 6662.639
this to happen

6663.76 --> 6668.159000000001
so yeah well it doesn't matter if google

6666.32 --> 6670.32
are ballers

6668.159 --> 6671.5199999999995
right it doesn't happen with nathan

6670.32 --> 6673.599
oakley it

6671.52 --> 6674.719
i don't know anybody else with which

6673.599 --> 6676.56
this happens

6674.719 --> 6677.84
except for the guys that have literally

6676.56 --> 6680.159000000001
just turned off

6677.84 --> 6681.360000000001
the numbers they turned it off i don't

6680.159 --> 6685.44
turn it off

6681.36 --> 6689.119
i just want it to be fixed i want auto

6685.44 --> 6691.678999999999
bots that do that [ __ ] that shouldn't be

6689.119 --> 6691.679
possible

6691.84 --> 6698.0
that should be taken care of by google

6694.4 --> 6698.0
they should do something about that

6698.719 --> 6705.76
right and i've been very

6701.76 --> 6708.320000000001
good to ballers i've literally

6705.76 --> 6710.320000000001
relinquished a lot of things like said

6708.32 --> 6713.04
like yeah ballers can't even go to

6710.32 --> 6715.599
heaven even though it's a lie

6713.04 --> 6716.4
it's a dream and i've even said like

6715.599 --> 6719.599
yeah i

6716.4 --> 6722.638999999999
envision a society where there can be

6719.599 --> 6723.119000000001
flat earth and ballers and they probably

6722.639 --> 6726.56
and

6723.119 --> 6728.4
be at peace or rather be back and forth

6726.56 --> 6731.280000000001
probably forever

6728.4 --> 6733.598999999999
some of them that feel that to have this

6731.28 --> 6736.32
competition a philosophical competition

6733.599 --> 6738.08
for as long as humanity exists i think

6736.32 --> 6739.119
that is possible i have a positive

6738.08 --> 6741.84
outlook

6739.119 --> 6743.679
between ballers and flat earth and this

6741.84 --> 6746.88
is what i get for it

6743.679 --> 6749.679
this is what i get auto

6746.88 --> 6751.119
bot down voting and trolling and people

6749.679 --> 6753.28
stalking me

6751.119 --> 6754.4
sending me shitty text messages over my

6753.28 --> 6765.84
phone

6754.4 --> 6765.839999999999
how messed up is that

6768.08 --> 6771.679
what are some of the things you would

6770.239 --> 6774.32
agree to

6771.679 --> 6775.599
with global physics nothing it's

6774.32 --> 6779.28
ridiculous

6775.599 --> 6781.76
the entire thing is ridiculous but

6779.28 --> 6783.84
in its ridiculousness there are things

6781.76 --> 6787.280000000001
that could be improved upon

6783.84 --> 6790.32
right model assumptions and

6787.28 --> 6794.4
i will do that for a meager

6790.32 --> 6796.88
66 million euros and don't wait too long

6794.4 --> 6798.5199999999995
because i will eventually up that price

6796.88 --> 6801.1990000000005
to

6798.52 --> 6804.080000000001
666 million

6801.199 --> 6805.28
i am going to do that at some point

6804.08 --> 6807.199
right

6805.28 --> 6809.599
longer you wait the more i'm gonna cost

6807.199 --> 6812.4
to actually do that because i can i can

6809.599 --> 6815.119000000001
fix the whole thing

6812.4 --> 6817.5199999999995
i can the structure of it i can do that

6815.119 --> 6821.28
i'm just not going to

6817.52 --> 6823.52
i'm not going to just give you

6821.28 --> 6825.04
the freaking goose that lays the gold

6823.52 --> 6827.52
neck just like that

6825.04 --> 6829.119
because i'm bored yeah i'm not doing

6827.52 --> 6832.2390000000005
that

6829.119 --> 6835.5199999999995
no i'm going to be paid for it

6832.239 --> 6837.839999999999
a lot a whole [ __ ] lot i'm not gonna

6835.52 --> 6841.360000000001
do it i'm just gonna continue

6837.84 --> 6843.92
being with flat earthers pointing out

6841.36 --> 6845.44
how nothing about the physics of the

6843.92 --> 6848.8
ball earth works

6845.44 --> 6852.879999999999
nothing about it works ever right

6848.8 --> 6852.88
and that's gonna stay that way

6853.28 --> 6860.239
very very long till i get actual

6857.04 --> 6863.36
payment big

6860.239 --> 6867.199
big numbers and then

6863.36 --> 6870.719
i will start explaining

6867.199 --> 6874.239
how the heliocentric model has to be

6870.719 --> 6877.599
in order to continue

6874.239 --> 6881.678999999999
and halfway appearance of reality

6877.599 --> 6881.679
right that's the way it's going to be

6882.4 --> 6886.239
yeah my people is blocked only used for

6884.96 --> 6888.0
shows official blocked

6886.239 --> 6892.159
for translate they don't allow this in

6888.0 --> 6892.159
what your paypal is blocked

6892.239 --> 6896.879999999999
i only used it your show

6897.199 --> 6900.879999999999
it really is that's bizarre

6902.84 --> 6908.96
really oh it hasn't been blocked for me

6906.56 --> 6908.96
at least

6912.96 --> 6916.88
all right but i i don't think you guys

6914.8 --> 6918.719
are going to get together 66 million

6916.88 --> 6922.2390000000005
euros anyway

6918.719 --> 6922.2390000000005
so i'm never going to get to that point

6924.96 --> 6929.28
it's going to have to be some serious

6930.84 --> 6933.84
investors

6944.84 --> 6947.84
yep

6963.92 --> 6968.56
google plus facebook right it's really

6967.04 --> 6970.48
[ __ ] up

6968.56 --> 6973.119000000001
and those algorithms should be

6970.48 --> 6977.199
completely purged

6973.119 --> 6980.88
you don't want to be a ranty dude ranty

6977.199 --> 6982.799999999999
can't do [ __ ] randy is just

6980.88 --> 6985.28
playing with people that's what he can

6982.8 --> 6988.639
do and he enjoys that [ __ ] he enjoys

6985.28 --> 6992.5599999999995
fooling people right i'm actually

6988.639 --> 6994.08
a cosmogenist i i know how these things

6992.56 --> 6997.92
work

6994.08 --> 7000.48
because i already got it all in my head

6997.92 --> 7001.28
from when i was still a baller and then

7000.48 --> 7004.159
i realized

7001.28 --> 7006.0
holy [ __ ] everybody that's actually

7004.159 --> 7009.36
doing this that's in control of this

7006.0 --> 7009.84
is completely corrupt and wants all life

7009.36 --> 7014.4
to be

7009.84 --> 7017.1990000000005
destroyed so i'm not gonna help them

7014.4 --> 7018.4
yeah that that's what's held it back

7017.199 --> 7021.598999999999
it's in there

7018.4 --> 7023.679
it's in my personal akashic record the

7021.599 --> 7025.76
entire blueprint and you're never gonna

7023.679 --> 7028.4
get it out

7025.76 --> 7028.88
i already have it i already made that

7028.4 --> 7031.839999999999
[ __ ]

7028.88 --> 7031.84
20 years ago

7034.159 --> 7038.96
paypal centering flat earth donations

7036.159 --> 7041.5199999999995
well that's pretty bizarre

7038.96 --> 7045.36
but hey michael b if you want to support

7041.52 --> 7049.52
you could also do it through patreon

7045.36 --> 7052.239
you were saying 6 million no 66 million

7049.52 --> 7059.52
it was 6 million 2 years ago it's 66

7052.239 --> 7061.919999999999
million now

7059.52 --> 7065.1990000000005
and somewhere in the next nine years

7061.92 --> 7067.52
it's going to be 666 million and nothing

7065.199 --> 7067.5199999999995
less

7070.639 --> 7077.76
but yeah it's a running joke that could

7074.88 --> 7078.96
in some crazy twist of fate become

7077.76 --> 7080.719
reality

7078.96 --> 7084.719
and then who knows right but if i'm

7080.719 --> 7084.719
gonna get that freaking donation from

7085.36 --> 7091.36
uh some related

7088.4 --> 7092.5599999999995
bank or something then i'm just gonna

7091.36 --> 7095.92
decline

7092.56 --> 7097.280000000001
right and it's going to be from actual

7095.92 --> 7100.4800000000005
people and not just

7097.28 --> 7102.159
absolutely evil satanic scumbags

7100.48 --> 7104.879999999999
that are literally going to put me on

7102.159 --> 7106.32
the list of oh he's a satanist now

7104.88 --> 7108.56
because that's not what's going to

7106.32 --> 7112.84
happen then i'm literally going to just

7108.56 --> 7114.0
so send it back no matter how much that

7112.84 --> 7116.8
is

7114.0 --> 7117.679
right anyway michael b if you want to

7116.8 --> 7120.159000000001
support me

7117.679 --> 7121.119
through ways other than paypal you can

7120.159 --> 7125.04
you could

7121.119 --> 7129.28
i hope it works for you you could also

7125.04 --> 7132.32
uh get in through patreon

7129.28 --> 7136.0
and i don't know if you deal in uh

7132.32 --> 7140.159
bitcoin and crypto i have some crypto

7136.0 --> 7140.159
wallet links too you can donate that way

7140.639 --> 7147.76
yeah 6606 i know i know

7143.92 --> 7147.76
dave johnson i know

7155.76 --> 7159.360000000001
that's the point because if i do any of

7158.639 --> 7161.599
it

7159.36 --> 7162.4
it's going to be a lie because the earth

7161.599 --> 7166.8
is not

7162.4 --> 7171.119
a ball but if i'm going to perfect that

7166.8 --> 7173.1990000000005
yeah i'm going to be perfecting a lie

7171.119 --> 7174.96
and that should be known i don't want

7173.199 --> 7177.44
anything to be

7174.96 --> 7179.36
mistaken about that it's going to be the

7177.44 --> 7182.839999999999
building of a dream the perfection of a

7179.36 --> 7185.5199999999995
dream it's not going to be real

7182.84 --> 7189.04
right

7185.52 --> 7191.119000000001
so yes you think oh that it's just a

7189.04 --> 7193.28
randomly picked number

7191.119 --> 7196.639
right you really think that i'm just

7193.28 --> 7199.84
gonna randomly pick that number

7196.639 --> 7199.84
you think

7199.92 --> 7203.52
no of course i didn't pick that number

7202.56 --> 7206.0
randomly

7203.52 --> 7206.0
come on

7207.92 --> 7211.28
george should have a ranch i don't know

7210.56 --> 7214.400000000001
george has

7211.28 --> 7216.159
not yet been messing up wrench activity

7214.4 --> 7218.0
in the past

7216.159 --> 7220.4
he used to have a wrench and then i took

7218.0 --> 7224.08
it away

7220.4 --> 7224.08
i don't know if he even wants one

7224.56 --> 7228.88
666 is carbon yeah sure it is

7231.119 --> 7235.28
it's material that's the the point of

7233.679 --> 7238.4800000000005
the material

7235.28 --> 7242.719
shell exclusive right it's

7238.48 --> 7245.759999999999
666 stands for material exclusive

7242.719 --> 7247.44
that's the point the material not the

7245.76 --> 7255.84
god not the spirit

7247.44 --> 7255.839999999999
that's the point of it

7258.4 --> 7264.159
remember in patreon yep you can do that

7260.96 --> 7264.159
without paypal indeed

7265.36 --> 7269.839999999999
right so if you sign up there that would

7267.44 --> 7269.839999999999
be awesome

7271.76 --> 7274.0
what

7280.08 --> 7283.119
anyway i'm gonna round out the show it's

7282.32 --> 7287.36
already past

7283.119 --> 7291.36
three so ah oh look at the downfall it's

7287.36 --> 7293.28
at minus 28 now oh the trolls they can't

7291.36 --> 7295.44
handle this

7293.28 --> 7297.36
so yeah if you haven't already voted up

7295.44 --> 7300.48
right rogens it up

7297.36 --> 7304.239
keep keep pumping it up let's he's just

7300.48 --> 7307.28
or that autobot [ __ ] doing this

7304.239 --> 7309.759999999999
is just gonna auto continue the down

7307.28 --> 7312.159
vote see he's already doing it

7309.76 --> 7314.2390000000005
remember that time when he got to minus

7312.159 --> 7316.32
100 votes

7314.239 --> 7317.678999999999
oh by the way the next day it was all

7316.32 --> 7322.239
gone

7317.679 --> 7325.28
so yeah it's it's just tempering

7322.239 --> 7329.28
just tempering fraud

7325.28 --> 7329.28
right fraud it's fraud

7329.92 --> 7333.84
and hey who cares you know it's just a

7331.599 --> 7338.400000000001
bunch of votes right well

7333.84 --> 7340.400000000001
i'm being subjected to fraud

7338.4 --> 7342.638999999999
in plain sight it's happening right

7340.4 --> 7342.638999999999
there

7343.679 --> 7347.679
thanks google thanks for just letting me

7346.48 --> 7351.598999999999
