274.32 --> 282.59999999999997

earlier but yeah uh over email anyway

282.6 --> 297.91
yeah what shall I talk about now

295.06 --> 300.52
normally compared to last week I'm not

297.91 --> 301.93
gonna be having a lot of it a lot of

300.52 --> 303.669
things to share because I haven't

301.93 --> 307.69
actually stayed up until four o'clock

303.669 --> 310.33
like well the last week it's not that

307.69 --> 312.34
great for my health either so maybe that

310.33 --> 316.09
kind of has something to do with it all

312.34 --> 320.46999999999997
so that just it just broke because I

316.09 --> 323.61999999999995
went to bed at yeah twelve o'clock so I

320.47 --> 325.53900000000004
didn't watch any [ __ ] American

323.62 --> 328.77
streams on the life I don't know what

325.539 --> 328.77
transpired I missed it all

339.749 --> 348.689
although not I didn't miss at all

344.039 --> 350.24899999999997
Owen Benjamin did stream pretty early so

348.689 --> 354.29900000000004
I did get to see that that was a lot of

350.249 --> 358.73900000000003
fun and I think I caught an Nathan also

354.299 --> 361.679
live from left of Hill so I did get to

358.739 --> 368.99899999999997
see some but yeah not a lot

361.679 --> 372.239
oh yeah Randy show now I I didn't catch

368.999 --> 378.629
Randy show I saw a rhombus was all night

372.239 --> 381.349
I watched it a bit of it and yeah I'm

378.629 --> 381.34900000000005
going to do other things

388.97 --> 396.08000000000004
Yeah right Missouri bear yeah man yeah

394.34 --> 400.90999999999997
it was it was a blast

396.08 --> 403.15
and to be fair it probably also was I

400.91 --> 406.49
think I got a bit over enthusiastic

403.15 --> 412.34
during that stream it was so fascinating

406.49 --> 415.88
and it was just great stuff and I think

412.34 --> 417.97999999999996
I kind of like didn't pay enough

415.88 --> 422.75
attention to like how much I was

417.98 --> 424.55
drinking from that ball that I've stuck

422.75 --> 428.71
back in the closet and I'm gonna touch

424.55 --> 431.21000000000004
that for a long time I hope sis yuck

428.71 --> 433.94
don't definitely don't want to go

431.21 --> 436.23999999999995
through what I did do that last night

433.94 --> 436.24
again

444.229 --> 448.09
what are you talking about Brenda

458.039 --> 470.419
what are you slandering on about now get

464.249 --> 470.41900000000004
the hell out of here Brenda just get out

472.19 --> 475.339
[Music]

478.44 --> 484.65
get some freaking help yeah remember

481.59 --> 495.69
yesterday I addressed you I meant it

484.65 --> 499.96999999999997
get some freaking help yeah that's right

495.69 --> 503.94
wrong saloon I'm sick of this [ __ ] you

499.97 --> 506.34000000000003
know I have no problem having ballers in

503.94 --> 509.85
my chat but if they're going to be like

506.34 --> 512.28
this and just constantly just attacking

509.85 --> 515.16
attacking attacking and slandering and

512.28 --> 520.91
just not communicating just inserting

515.16 --> 520.91
crap no get out don't want you here

531.54 --> 541.029
right yeah well Missouri bear I what I

536.199 --> 543.04
really was like the thing is sometimes

541.029 --> 544.81
this happens you know some people have

543.04 --> 548.139
like a lot of energy they have this

544.81 --> 552.3699999999999
certain level that they hit and when

548.139 --> 555.519
crow yesterday and Big Bear came

552.37 --> 558.73
together it's like that the combination

555.519 --> 560.379
of them somewhat moved the bar like they

558.73 --> 562.629
could reach further and they got some

560.379 --> 563.41
really fantastic insights that they shed

562.629 --> 566.019
I loved it

563.41 --> 569.079
like for example they eventually figured

566.019 --> 570.819
out maybe this is pure crow I haven't

569.079 --> 573.579
followed crow so I don't know how much

570.819 --> 575.769
he has developed I think he's probably

573.579 --> 579.8499999999999
have been has been developing a lot he

575.769 --> 581.319
sounded even kind of better than I

579.85 --> 583.36
remembered him from the last time I

581.319 --> 587.68
heard him but they came to the

583.36 --> 591.97
conclusion that geometry is unnatural

587.68 --> 598.209
that man put it there and that's just

591.97 --> 601.899
like yes yes thank you thank you it is

598.209 --> 605.9799999999999
not natural mankind put it there and

601.899 --> 608.949
some people are like reinforcing that

605.98 --> 613.629
have been reinforcing that's like almost

608.949 --> 615.459
like a mathematics religion mathematical

613.629 --> 617.7090000000001
based religion and you just insert that

615.459 --> 621.5189999999999
religion in the things that you deal

617.709 --> 624.79
with because you can and therefore those

621.519 --> 627.73
after you will stumble upon it probably

624.79 --> 630.91
and then if they're not going to talk

627.73 --> 632.6800000000001
down they will think oh wow it is Nate

630.91 --> 634.48
its natural we seem to see this

632.68 --> 637.809
everywhere and that is kind of the trick

634.48 --> 641.62
and I loved that they put that out there

637.809 --> 644.279
on the show it's just fantastic totally

641.62 --> 644.279
agreed to that

648.56 --> 656.88
yeah yeah and evolution of course yeah

654.149 --> 659.61
I'm really proud of yesterday's hangout

656.88 --> 662.1
concerning the evolution aspect I was

659.61 --> 664.64
think yesterday was it just rambling

662.1 --> 668.0400000000001
about Brenda no no no I think I did

664.64 --> 670.9499999999999
Dragon evolution as well and I really

668.04 --> 671.5799999999999
stand behind all that what I said it was

670.95 --> 678.4200000000001
great

671.58 --> 681.4200000000001
I watched it back it was good and this

678.42 --> 682.709
subject is getting more momentum more

681.42 --> 686.93
momentum than ever

682.709 --> 688.92
it's like earlier on it was just certain

686.93 --> 691.8299999999999
questions you could say like

688.92 --> 693.779
specifically ID for example I know the

691.83 --> 696.12
only one I knew that did that was Kent

693.779 --> 699.149
Hovind he would go against evolution

696.12 --> 702.23
from his research at their spec from his

699.149 --> 705.0
approach his ways of doing things

702.23 --> 706.86
which I personally would never do that

705.0 --> 708.6
but he is his own man and he's been

706.86 --> 711.3290000000001
doing it for a long time he went to jail

708.6 --> 716.63
for that [ __ ] so but that was that back

711.329 --> 720.209
then now it seems evolution is not just

716.63 --> 723.72
something to point at if you're a

720.209 --> 728.3
Christian or a biblical know it it's

723.72 --> 728.3000000000001
wider than that there's so much more

729.17 --> 735.149
physical empirical evidence that an

732.41 --> 739.73
research that has been done in thinking

735.149 --> 743.88
by a lot of people that have brought

739.73 --> 746.3100000000001
evolution under scrutiny much more than

743.88 --> 750.05
say 20 years ago it's widely talked

746.31 --> 754.89
about now widely it's a total

750.05 --> 756.87
alternative media subject totally it's

754.89 --> 759.68
widely controversy it maybe it is just

756.87 --> 763.529
as controversial as flat earth although

759.68 --> 766.079
yeah flat earth is much more much

763.529 --> 767.67
heavier because of the obviousness of

766.079 --> 771.79
the indoctrination that we get

767.67 --> 775.06
confronted with evolution is not

771.79 --> 777.9399999999999
as obvious not to the same degree but it

775.06 --> 781.3499999999999
is still so controversial that a lot of

777.94 --> 784.8100000000001
people now get into that and it's great

781.35 --> 788.0500000000001
we need we need that we it's very

784.81 --> 794.25
important to know the foundations of

788.05 --> 798.1899999999999
life in order to understand it and

794.25 --> 803.07
evolution doesn't explain anything it's

798.19 --> 803.07
just a story with a lot of excuses

806.58 --> 809.7
[Music]

816.11 --> 824.03
ah yeah oh that's hilarious septic

820.84 --> 828.59
God created life to evolve on its own

824.03 --> 831.05
yeah that's the Stan Marsh approach from

828.59 --> 834.5300000000001
South Park and I kind of do respect that

831.05 --> 837.05
in some way like yeah sure I thought

834.53 --> 839.54
that at first like Oh Evelyn oh sure why

837.05 --> 842.38
not well of course God made it like that

839.54 --> 846.92
that's how I saw it back then way back

842.38 --> 850.25
but no the problem is is that the very

846.92 --> 854.66
process of evolution is contradictory to

850.25 --> 857.27
the nature of the building blocks that's

854.66 --> 859.9
the problem so it doesn't work

857.27 --> 862.22
evolution by itself does not work

859.9 --> 864.9499999999999
adaptation however does work but it has

862.22 --> 867.44
very specific parameters in how it works

864.95 --> 872.96
and it is all very dependent on the

867.44 --> 880.6400000000001
original design so all life is design

872.96 --> 884.1800000000001
based not evolution based a and the

880.64 --> 886.37
design was made to adapt but not to

884.18 --> 889.4599999999999
completely transform into other designs

886.37 --> 893.42
that was never that's never been the

889.46 --> 895.97
design if it would have been then we'd

893.42 --> 899.4399999999999
see some very tangible evidence for that

895.97 --> 899.44
and we don't

912.43 --> 918.6099999999999
yeah yeah Robin Stanley well I think

915.4 --> 921.6999999999999
that you know you look this is personal

918.61 --> 924.5500000000001
I don't really like rap overall there's

921.7 --> 929.5
some good rap out there I guess but I've

924.55 --> 932.92
never really taken yeah I never really

929.5 --> 936.72
liked the the genre although for example

932.92 --> 939.76
my nephew who's not with us anymore

936.72 --> 944.74
he was into rap you didn't Dead

939.76 --> 947.11
performances back then and I kind of

944.74 --> 949.8100000000001
liked it I liked the style back then

947.11 --> 952.0
because back then it was before the

949.81 --> 954.28
gangster rap revolution had literally

952.0 --> 963.7
ruined everything including probably his

954.28 --> 965.89
life before it was still it was just a

963.7 --> 970.63
personal way to tell a story through

965.89 --> 973.42
music with more words and it was quite

970.63 --> 975.58
interesting back then but yeah what it's

973.42 --> 978.2199999999999
now well now it's kind of like a new

975.58 --> 980.71
grassroots attempt to overcome the

978.22 --> 984.01
gangster Illuminati nonsense

980.71 --> 986.62
so although the money the grabbers was

984.01 --> 990.01
still among the bottom line will still

986.62 --> 993.37
go for that probably but there's still a

990.01 --> 995.61
lot of like grassroots rap artists that

993.37 --> 1000.03
are really trying to now become

995.61 --> 1004.89
conspiracy rappers and a definitely been

1000.03 --> 1008.01
around like Oh Dee Dee you know he's one

1004.89 --> 1009.72
of our primary rap Flat Earth rap

1008.01 --> 1012.21
artists and he's been doing it for a

1009.72 --> 1014.75
while but it seems like it's catching on

1012.21 --> 1018.0600000000001
it's like really catching on and it's

1014.75 --> 1023.089
giving the rap scene another chance the

1018.06 --> 1025.95
medium another chance and even though I

1023.089 --> 1030.04
don't really like rap music I still

1025.95 --> 1032.809
think it's good that it happens you know

1030.04 --> 1035.54
it's good to see and hey don't

1032.809 --> 1037.52
underestimate the power of rap even back

1035.54 --> 1042.62
then in the 90s before it got all

1037.52 --> 1048.28
gangster gangster eyes it it catches on

1042.62 --> 1048.28
a lot it spreads very easily

1057.9 --> 1067.8300000000002
what oh right yes Italian that was a

1063.059 --> 1072.99
long long time ago now but yeah my my

1067.83 --> 1075.6299999999999
cousin was he had what is it like

1072.99 --> 1079.559
serious depression issues since his

1075.63 --> 1081.6000000000001
teens and yeah the just just imagine

1079.559 --> 1083.6399999999999
having that and then the freaking

1081.6 --> 1086.04
pressure of the world he was very smart

1083.64 --> 1088.74
so I think like me he also had his

1086.04 --> 1092.96
senses and it punished him a bit too

1088.74 --> 1099.179
much I think so he couldn't handle it

1092.96 --> 1105.5
it's very tragic he was a really nice

1099.179 --> 1105.5
guy like really good good-hearted but

1106.4 --> 1113.3300000000002
yeah it happens

1117.49 --> 1124.88
also yeah he unlike me did go into

1122.74 --> 1129.2
pharmaceuticals he like took

1124.88 --> 1131.8700000000001
antidepressants and stuff and having

1129.2 --> 1138.799
seen how that result that I'm really

1131.87 --> 1144.6789999999999
glad that I didn't do that yeah it that

1138.799 --> 1147.6399999999999
was like 15 years ago it was shortly

1144.679 --> 1147.64
after my mother

1149.22 --> 1152.309
[Music]

1154.179 --> 1159.15
I think

1156.75 --> 1160.95
well white ya know it might have been

1159.15 --> 1163.92
like eleven years ago or something night

1160.95 --> 1167.57
you know there was a long time ago

1163.92 --> 1171.27
and I really miss him you know I wish I

1167.57 --> 1176.01
attempted back then like once Lee we

1171.27 --> 1178.02
were both on the train going to and I

1176.01 --> 1180.57
had a one-on-one talk I rarely have that

1178.02 --> 1182.31
chance if we were among family that

1180.57 --> 1186.12
could have never happened and I kind of

1182.31 --> 1188.79
like broke Alex Jones to him back then

1186.12 --> 1191.7299999999998
and was still very fresh but it I it was

1188.79 --> 1194.07
too heavy I was like oh there's a war on

1191.73 --> 1195.8700000000001
in the world and we're all they're

1194.07 --> 1198.48
attempting to mind controls and hide

1195.87 --> 1202.3799999999999
information from us and there is so much

1198.48 --> 1204.54
more hope you just gotta you gotta be

1202.38 --> 1207.15
brave and find it I really try to

1204.54 --> 1210.99
inspire him back then but I yeah I

1207.15 --> 1213.63
didn't work unfortunately if it had

1210.99 --> 1216.8700000000001
worked and maybe I could have had like

1213.63 --> 1218.67
my awesome cousin and call him up I bet

1216.87 --> 1227.79
he would have gotten into conspiracy

1218.67 --> 1230.64
theory a lot but yeah I don't know

1227.79 --> 1236.6399999999999
stallion 80 12 I guess he's on the other

1230.64 --> 1239.46
side waiting problem is I never really

1236.64 --> 1243.68
got to know him that well after my teens

1239.46 --> 1247.3400000000001
and again after my mother died like

1243.68 --> 1250.26
everything just fell apart and I

1247.34 --> 1255.1499999999999
including the connection with my with my

1250.26 --> 1259.82
nephew with I said cousin ah male is

1255.15 --> 1259.8200000000002
that cousin or nephew I get confused

1263.34 --> 1267.06
it's nephew right

1286.59 --> 1292.87
yeah well his disciple we a we haven't

1289.84 --> 1296.11
seen the last of Christ's allergy and we

1292.87 --> 1305.53
won't for a long time I think that will

1296.11 --> 1309.36
persist very long yeah that that

1305.53 --> 1309.36
struggle isn't just go and go away

1319.029 --> 1328.129
no regner Stefan Alderson what I was

1323.69 --> 1330.169
saying is that if he had lived then it's

1328.129 --> 1334.009
very likely he would have gotten into

1330.169 --> 1337.8990000000001
that because it is conspiracy theories

1334.009 --> 1340.279
are like food for the mind of

1337.899 --> 1343.34
intelligent people like Owen Benjamin

1340.279 --> 1345.08
explains this as well it's like I you

1343.34 --> 1347.029
started watching porn get addicted to

1345.08 --> 1351.6999999999998
that or you go into conspiracy theories

1347.029 --> 1355.249
I did that although to be fair I had my

1351.7 --> 1357.8300000000002
modest fair share of porn and not really

1355.249 --> 1360.109
proud of it I I tried to stay away from

1357.83 --> 1365.379
it as much as possible now I realize

1360.109 --> 1368.389
much more like just the negative impact

1365.379 --> 1371.779
so I tried to stay away from it as much

1368.389 --> 1375.049
as possible you know I'm not gonna tell

1371.779 --> 1377.239
you the schedule but I literally just

1375.049 --> 1380.049
compared to ten years ago I almost

1377.239 --> 1382.6390000000001
nothing just sometimes you know just get

1380.049 --> 1387.59
can't help it for a moment but it's bad

1382.639 --> 1391.1899999999998
shouldn't not proud of it anyway but

1387.59 --> 1392.9289999999999
what I was saying about my Mike my

1391.19 --> 1395.3300000000002
nephew is that it would have been very

1392.929 --> 1398.8990000000001
likely that he would have gotten into

1395.33 --> 1401.059
conspiracy theories at some point and it

1398.899 --> 1403.1
could have worked for him because I was

1401.059 --> 1407.84
there I was already there I literally

1403.1 --> 1410.899
like try to give him a hand like take my

1407.84 --> 1413.6589999999999
hand step out of the darkness you know

1410.899 --> 1416.059
if you feel like nothing's worth it it's

1413.659 --> 1422.45
not true there's a fight out there you

1416.059 --> 1424.759
can make that into the thing that makes

1422.45 --> 1427.779
it worth living for the challenge I

1424.759 --> 1427.779
tried but

1430.51 --> 1440.78
and that was way before Flat Earth right

1433.25 --> 1446.59
away so it's kind of weird because I

1440.78 --> 1450.5
think that he might have known about

1446.59 --> 1454.37
Flat Earth I think that one of the last

1450.5 --> 1457.19
times I saw him he was like in a he was

1454.37 --> 1462.7399999999998
spiraling like he was like trying to

1457.19 --> 1464.54
distract him like babbling it's tragic

1462.74 --> 1466.85
when that happened it's like when

1464.54 --> 1473.87
they're really punished inside I've been

1466.85 --> 1477.35
through that myself in occasion like so

1473.87 --> 1479.54
I recognized it but I wasn't aware I was

1477.35 --> 1483.83
still very much in this space and all

1479.54 --> 1487.25
that and I was kind of ignorant almost

1483.83 --> 1488.99
self self made ignorant a bit because I

1487.25 --> 1492.7
couldn't handle much of what was going

1488.99 --> 1494.54
down in the world back then so I was

1492.7 --> 1496.6100000000001
oversimplifying things a bit and

1494.54 --> 1498.26
dreaming about space even though there

1496.61 --> 1502.04
were already hints that there's so much

1498.26 --> 1505.19
wrong I even got that info during my

1502.04 --> 1508.58
school time but I mentioned some things

1505.19 --> 1512.51
and he responded like with great shock

1508.58 --> 1517.1599999999999
to it so I think that he was aware

1512.51 --> 1521.93
probably of flat earth and he early on

1517.16 --> 1524.3600000000001
and he couldn't he couldn't step back or

1521.93 --> 1526.25
something and he it might have like just

1524.36 --> 1527.6599999999999
been terrible time I don't know this is

1526.25 --> 1530.51
like very fringe

1527.66 --> 1534.89
I shouldn't be speculating on that but I

1530.51 --> 1536.6299999999999
thought at the time after at way after

1534.89 --> 1539.0300000000002
after I got confronted with bladder

1536.63 --> 1543.0800000000002
earth I said they thought back to that

1539.03 --> 1545.33
and it's like what did he know was that

1543.08 --> 1548.24
part of the reason why he felt so

1545.33 --> 1550.97
punished that he was kind of isolated

1548.24 --> 1554.47
among his family I know that nobody in

1550.97 --> 1558.52
my nephew's family will probably ever

1554.47 --> 1561.4
accept letter they're all very statist

1558.52 --> 1563.83
in and very a theist in a way they'd

1561.4 --> 1568.99
like to learn about religions but they

1563.83 --> 1573.1599999999999
don't accept it so if he would have gone

1568.99 --> 1574.96
against that people would probably just

1573.16 --> 1576.8200000000002
his own family would have called him

1574.96 --> 1578.97
crazy for it and then when he is

1576.82 --> 1583.3899999999999
actually depressed yeah that's like

1578.97 --> 1586.03
double rough so I'm speculating that he

1583.39 --> 1588.6100000000001
might have been in a very complex

1586.03 --> 1590.82
situation that nobody understood that

1588.61 --> 1590.82
then

1612.68 --> 1622.46
anyway let's not let's move on to a less

1616.28 --> 1624.3899999999999
depressing subject yeah what could have

1622.46 --> 1628.079
been

1624.39 --> 1628.0790000000002
[Music]

1634.59 --> 1637.6599999999999
[Music]

1640.99 --> 1651.13
I wonder if at some point I I might get

1647.82 --> 1653.8899999999999
verbally intellectually closer to my

1651.13 --> 1656.429
brother and his family as I said I

1653.89 --> 1660.64
didn't talked about him before like

1656.429 --> 1664.63
there's this brother issue between us

1660.64 --> 1666.7
like a barrier that we had a certain

1664.63 --> 1671.5
attitude towards one another and then he

1666.7 --> 1674.44
didn't work anymore we've and then

1671.5 --> 1677.679
family broke apart and he has changed I

1674.44 --> 1680.95
think in a lot of ways moved away from

1677.679 --> 1683.529
that that way of doing things and so

1680.95 --> 1685.96
have I and we barely recognize each

1683.529 --> 1688.84
other but I think he's still holding on

1685.96 --> 1692.32
to the same type of foundations and I

1688.84 --> 1695.32
wonder if he ever can like have a long

1692.32 --> 1701.97
serious conversation about this stuff if

1695.32 --> 1701.97
you'll if you'll want to I wonder

1711.04 --> 1718.27
trial James troll well I think that my

1715.99 --> 1720.669
brother to be fair is kind of has been

1718.27 --> 1725.049
for a long time has been embarrassed for

1720.669 --> 1730.7800000000002
me because well I never really got into

1725.049 --> 1732.82
a working life and and I even said at

1730.78 --> 1737.1399999999999
some point like yeah I'm a Satanist now

1732.82 --> 1739.059
and all that and I and that just left

1737.14 --> 1742.2900000000002
such a bad impression and kind of

1739.059 --> 1744.85
embarrassed about it but then again I

1742.29 --> 1749.44
went through some very weird things

1744.85 --> 1752.35
myself so I don't think he approves of

1749.44 --> 1755.29
my lifestyle but I don't know maybe he

1752.35 --> 1759.9289999999999
does see there is some progress he has

1755.29 --> 1759.9289999999999
to see that there is progress in me

1761.429 --> 1766.65
compared to 20 years ago it's dramatic

1769.02 --> 1773.97
and my father can testify to that

1778.11 --> 1785.08
but I don't think he really really cares

1781.84 --> 1789.75
I don't know maybe he does it's just

1785.08 --> 1789.75
that we don't have any contact with I

1789.99 --> 1795.31
think he's just being busy with his

1792.85 --> 1799.24
family you know he's got two kids now

1795.31 --> 1802.45
there there should be young teenagers

1799.24 --> 1806.02
now so he's got his hands full it

1802.45 --> 1811.51
probably doesn't even have time to think

1806.02 --> 1814.24
about other family too much he should be

1811.51 --> 1821.02
supporting me why why should he be

1814.24 --> 1824.08
supporting me you have brother you know

1821.02 --> 1827.71
like son and he's an old he's a half

1824.08 --> 1832.87
brother he's a half older brother that

1827.71 --> 1841.29
we share a mother he never respected my

1832.87 --> 1841.29
father really he and so it's just I

1842.58 --> 1849.97
don't know like if I had like a a full

1846.7 --> 1851.41
brother I guess that would be roughly at

1849.97 --> 1854.08
the same age maybe a few years

1851.41 --> 1856.3600000000001
difference that's a very different type

1854.08 --> 1857.5
of family setup that's a different role

1856.36 --> 1860.56
those are different rules

1857.5 --> 1862.78
my brother is seven years older and he

1860.56 --> 1865.45
was a teenager when I was a little kid

1862.78 --> 1868.09
and he in a way a lot of the times he

1865.45 --> 1871.1200000000001
took over father role when my dad was

1868.09 --> 1876.37
kind of being sloppy a bit although as

1871.12 --> 1878.6699999999998
it that was mostly during my my teens by

1876.37 --> 1878.6699999999998
the way

1889.71 --> 1899.3700000000001
I don't know julieopp heaven if look I

1897.24 --> 1904.07
see it like this if there's peace

1899.37 --> 1904.07
between my brother and me I'm happy

1919.14 --> 1925.5400000000002
right and I don't want to get in too

1922.69 --> 1928.93
much detail but there's also just his

1925.54 --> 1932.77
psychological makeup compared to mine is

1928.93 --> 1935.64
very different so he like principally

1932.77 --> 1938.29
responds very different to things it's

1935.64 --> 1941.26
sometimes it's even confusing for like I

1938.29 --> 1943.72
don't understand how he does things I've

1941.26 --> 1946.39
had trouble with that when I was young

1943.72 --> 1949.8600000000001
as well and I think that he probably is

1946.39 --> 1956.429
very confused about know how I do things

1949.86 --> 1960.4289999999999
for example I am extremely open and very

1956.429 --> 1963.94
fluid in the tongue he's not like that

1960.429 --> 1968.17
he is very like more old-fashioned proud

1963.94 --> 1970.45
type of guy and he has certain feeling

1968.17 --> 1973.72
issues that he just doesn't share like

1970.45 --> 1976.27
never and I could see it like slaps me

1973.72 --> 1976.84
in the face sometimes but he won't talk

1976.27 --> 1980.32
about it

1976.84 --> 1983.8
he just doesn't so yeah that's a great

1980.32 --> 1988.03
come be right the ultimate never shuts

1983.8 --> 1989.8899999999999
up guy and the one that just doesn't

1988.03 --> 1998.26
want to talk about their feelings yes it

1989.89 --> 1999.88
doesn't really work well yeah all right

1998.26 --> 2004.2
well julieopp happened my brother is

1999.88 --> 2009.929
definitely not an [ __ ] he is he's a

2004.2 --> 2013.05
very responsible human being but he's

2009.929 --> 2015.99
also also mistaken in certain things my

2013.05 --> 2017.8799999999999
my view but it's not like he hasn't

2015.99 --> 2020.13
thought it out well it's a very

2017.88 --> 2026.5500000000002
structured smart guy he's technically

2020.13 --> 2029.5100000000002
more intelligent than I am that that's

2026.55 --> 2029.51
how it was measured

2048.419 --> 2053.3689999999997
anyway what's up Family Talk today I

2051.01 --> 2053.369
guess

2070.879 --> 2080.79
now actually talking about this does it

2077.819 --> 2083.869
does actually help my stomach stomach

2080.79 --> 2083.869
feels a lot better now

2088.81 --> 2093.2999999999997
[Music]

2105.81 --> 2109.099
[Music]

2115.46 --> 2118.46
mm-hmm

2120.68 --> 2129.81
all right yeah thanks Martin Ellen it

2126.119 --> 2134.04
just came up maybe it is also because of

2129.81 --> 2140.67
the stomach punishment it does tend to

2134.04 --> 2145.7
make me I don't know dwell in in more of

2140.67 --> 2145.7000000000003
those types of ideas and feelings and

2159.599 --> 2163.4300000000003
what's going on in jet here

2170.39 --> 2186.5899999999997
dumbass it's just pure [ __ ] there's

2182.28 --> 2192.42
no amount of money available for that

2186.59 --> 2195.57
it's total nonsense if some baller would

2192.42 --> 2197.88
say okay I'm gonna give a hundred or

2195.57 --> 2201.4500000000003
thousand to usually always do it like

2197.88 --> 2205.9500000000003
that the thousand dollars then okay but

2201.45 --> 2209.7
it's just pure [ __ ] to say there's

2205.95 --> 2213.93
like forty four billion no no it's not

2209.7 --> 2217.49
so sure that misinformation where the

2213.93 --> 2217.49
Sun don't shine and get

2222.26 --> 2224.92
yeah

2233.57 --> 2239.86
all right well yet and besides look that

2237.26 --> 2244.61
the problem is not that we can't prove

2239.86 --> 2246.6800000000003
the earth is flat we can super long

2244.61 --> 2251.1800000000003
distance ight the problem is is that the

2246.68 --> 2253.43
bad bow ballers then like on top of that

2251.18 --> 2255.23
basic evidence you see something it's

2253.43 --> 2258.62
because it's there they then put their

2255.23 --> 2261.29
are based refraction Tov it's like no

2258.62 --> 2264.02
it's not there it's behind the kerf it's

2261.29 --> 2266.12
looming up that that's what rumpus is

2264.02 --> 2268.31
presentation on ran T's was all about

2266.12 --> 2271.37
yesterday the part that I got to see at

2268.31 --> 2274.88
least so to them it's never proof

2271.37 --> 2278.66
because they still got are in between

2274.88 --> 2280.58
they can't let go of our so it's always

2278.66 --> 2282.71
curve to them no matter what they see

2280.58 --> 2284.5699999999997
yes it looks perfectly flat yes it's

2282.71 --> 2289.04
straight there yes there's no deviation

2284.57 --> 2291.5
but it's a ball because everything is

2289.04 --> 2297.68
actually a ball it just looks perfectly

2291.5 --> 2301.19
flat that's that's the ballers it's all

2297.68 --> 2303.46
it's the curse of our they can't let it

2301.19 --> 2303.46
go

2316.15 --> 2320.3
so they have always just say no there's

2318.68 --> 2322.73
no proof because as soon as you hand

2320.3 --> 2324.5600000000004
them actual proof based on the empirical

2322.73 --> 2327.41
data and reasoning that they will just

2324.56 --> 2329.96
say no it's actually a ball all bending

2327.41 --> 2330.71
into what you see there this is how it

2329.96 --> 2334.31
should work

2330.71 --> 2335.78
our based refraction then the

2334.31 --> 2338.38
machination comes out and then you can

2335.78 --> 2340.73
disprove it it's no use

2338.38 --> 2343.19
it's no you should you can spend

2340.73 --> 2345.47
probably hours and hours and hours on

2343.19 --> 2347.42
specifically for example rumpus this

2345.47 --> 2352.22
little machination model what he did now

2347.42 --> 2355.79
and yeah everybody would just be

2352.22 --> 2358.1299999999997
confused impatient that flat earthers

2355.79 --> 2359.08
still no it's a machination so they

2358.13 --> 2362.119
already knew that

2359.08 --> 2365.06
ballers will just be like well but it's

2362.119 --> 2369.56
so Eclair you just don't understand you

2365.06 --> 2371.599
just don't understand that's how it

2369.56 --> 2374.75
works that's how they keep themselves

2371.599 --> 2382.6090000000004
into their delusion forever no matter

2374.75 --> 2385.66
what that's how it works the earth is

2382.609 --> 2389.63
very much flat

2385.66 --> 2389.6299999999997
[Music]

2396.89 --> 2403.43
no no rector Stefano listen there is no

2400.759 --> 2407.72
Sh no shadows there's just the darker

2403.43 --> 2412.22
parts the apparent light darkness

2407.72 --> 2415.73
contrast on the lights and it's actually

2412.22 --> 2419.1189999999997
a light apparition the moon like a

2415.73 --> 2423.049
hologram and it has dark and light parts

2419.119 --> 2426.8900000000003
yeah it's not a shadow a shadow would

2423.049 --> 2429.529
imply physical light obstruction and

2426.89 --> 2433.22
there is not there is no light shining

2429.529 --> 2435.349
on the moon it is the light and the moon

2433.22 --> 2437.3289999999997
is what we see at the epicenter of the

2435.349 --> 2437.9500000000003
direction of where that light is coming

2437.329 --> 2441.4100000000003
from

2437.95 --> 2444.499
there's no shadows on the moon that just

2441.41 --> 2446.839
look like shadows because that's the

2444.499 --> 2449.72
nature of the hologram it's very

2446.839 --> 2451.759
confusing I know it's people can get

2449.72 --> 2454.509
quite crazy over it that's why they call

2451.759 --> 2458.18
it and they used to call that lunatics

2454.509 --> 2461.569
because it just seemed so physical right

2458.18 --> 2465.2
sort of it just seems so physical sort

2461.569 --> 2468.259
of right you can think of it as a

2465.2 --> 2470.47
physical thing it's very easy but it's

2468.259 --> 2470.47
not

2470.54 --> 2473.82
[Music]

2476.03 --> 2487.4100000000003
[Music]

2484.41 --> 2487.41
get

2505.84 --> 2517.2400000000002
what well with a Randi cam you can prove

2510.13 --> 2519.46
that the moon is officially there that

2517.24 --> 2521.1299999999997
you can see it and that it has light and

2519.46 --> 2524.11
dark parts oh yeah I could prove that

2521.13 --> 2526.51
it's an observation then you get the

2524.11 --> 2528.9100000000003
observation data now if you're gonna

2526.51 --> 2530.5600000000004
draw all these conclusions based on a

2528.91 --> 2534.16
presupposition that it's a round

2530.56 --> 2538.57
physical object orbiting a presupposed

2534.16 --> 2540.8799999999997
fear achill earth and that's why it

2538.57 --> 2543.01
seems like a shadow yeah then you got a

2540.88 --> 2544.9900000000002
problem because then you got all these

2543.01 --> 2547.3
presuppositions you need to prove first

2544.99 --> 2549.31
and why don't you for example proof that

2547.3 --> 2552.15
you can actually approach the moon mmm

2549.31 --> 2554.98
ooh wait yeah that doesn't work does it

2552.15 --> 2557.19
always bends away when you try to go

2554.98 --> 2557.19
there

2561.5 --> 2564.86
no it's not

2577.319 --> 2583.219
yeah yeah Missouri bear indeed la Luna

2601.89 --> 2607.2999999999997
well Missouri bear who knows I'm pretty

2605.26 --> 2613.119
sure that the Sun is kind of the same

2607.3 --> 2615.1600000000003
thing as the moon like how it works is

2613.119 --> 2618.369
just another type of light ends much

2615.16 --> 2619.6299999999997
stronger so maybe maybe it would look

2618.369 --> 2623.1400000000003
like the moon let's hope we'll never

2619.63 --> 2628.9500000000003
find out because I'm kind of happy with

2623.14 --> 2628.95
the Sun don't we don't need two moons

2634.22 --> 2637.2999999999997
[Music]

2646.99 --> 2654.64
yeah Robin Stanley I remember that I've

2652.48 --> 2660.09
went to planetariums as well loft that

2654.64 --> 2662.35
[ __ ] and they would just talk and talk

2660.09 --> 2665.44
but I don't know what it would be like

2662.35 --> 2667.54
nowadays you know in a way it's also

2665.44 --> 2669.67
because Flat Earth has become a thing

2667.54 --> 2673.72
that they're all seeming to be more like

2669.67 --> 2676.39
political about their about their model

2673.72 --> 2679.72
and about what they think it is so maybe

2676.39 --> 2682.5699999999997
people at planetariums are getting more

2679.72 --> 2685.6
pushy that's really detrimental actually

2682.57 --> 2692.53
that's really bad for the future of

2685.6 --> 2695.58
their religion it's if they just let the

2692.53 --> 2699.51
mechanics be the mechanics and let the

2695.58 --> 2703.18
yeah let the imagination do its work and

2699.51 --> 2705.25
not Ram it so much down everybody's

2703.18 --> 2707.71
throat then yeah people could

2705.25 --> 2711.55
potentially in there you still enjoy the

2707.71 --> 2712.9900000000002
idea and the dreams and then figure it

2711.55 --> 2716.6800000000003
out in the course of their life that

2712.99 --> 2719.4399999999996
that's actually not possible but no no

2716.68 --> 2726.0899999999997
they gotta be no you got to believe you

2719.44 --> 2729.16
have to believe or you're stupid science

2726.09 --> 2732.19
we're half the body of science we got

2729.16 --> 2734.77
all the measurements in the data and

2732.19 --> 2736.75
then you really try to enquire and then

2734.77 --> 2740.08
everybody each and every one of them

2736.75 --> 2742.09
always ends up like wait maybe I need to

2740.08 --> 2744.22
look that up oh yeah because they didn't

2742.09 --> 2748.1800000000003
know because every single one of them is

2744.22 --> 2749.77
used to just asserting the story that's

2748.18 --> 2751.7799999999997
what everybody does in the globe

2749.77 --> 2753.58
religion just assert the story and if

2751.78 --> 2756.19
you tell it right then I'll also say uh

2753.58 --> 2757.99
I like how you said that then I've got

2756.19 --> 2760.15
to do the research they just like how

2757.99 --> 2763.1499999999996
they said that and then maybe some

2760.15 --> 2766.84
technical thing will then be highlighted

2763.15 --> 2769.14
and then dwelled upon like a fractal but

2766.84 --> 2771.73
it's generally just telling the story

2769.14 --> 2773.8599999999997
that's what ballers are used to that's

2771.73 --> 2777.87
what the religion is used to nobody

2773.86 --> 2777.8700000000003
double checks every single fact

2778.189 --> 2784.259
and that's why they always had no not

2782.309 --> 2796.559
knowing what the hell they're talking

2784.259 --> 2800.009
about just asserting it no Laurie I'm

2796.559 --> 2802.739
I'm criticizing you for not looking it

2800.009 --> 2806.009
up for first asserting it during

2802.739 --> 2807.66
conversations and then when you're asked

2806.009 --> 2811.259
about it it actually turns out you

2807.66 --> 2812.519
didn't really know it how many times

2811.259 --> 2821.099
does that happen now

2812.519 --> 2823.5589999999997
a lot of course Brenda is the primary

2821.099 --> 2826.259
example of this I wouldn't say you're as

2823.559 --> 2828.92
bad as Brenda Laurie but you've had your

2826.259 --> 2828.92
moments as well

2862.79 --> 2870.8
Noma sorry bear it wouldn't work that

2867.9 --> 2870.8
that can't work

2871.19 --> 2877.35
look the thing about NASA and what they

2875.13 --> 2880.29
do is it's all about the dream it's

2877.35 --> 2880.89
about the model in the dream that's what

2880.29 --> 2882.99
they're good at

2880.89 --> 2886.92
they're they make the movie they make

2882.99 --> 2891.0
the dream for us that's what that is

2886.92 --> 2892.8
it cannot switch around well they may be

2891.0 --> 2894.78
doing things they may be doing actual

2892.8 --> 2897.4500000000003
research you're like laboratory research

2894.78 --> 2901.23
and all that and figuring out things but

2897.45 --> 2903.21
like going for a flat earth that that

2901.23 --> 2905.94
doesn't make sense because everything

2903.21 --> 2908.67
they've done is literally to uphold that

2905.94 --> 2910.68
image that specific image and how that

2908.67 --> 2913.02
works psychologically on people and

2910.68 --> 2917.73
that's why it works they couldn't just

2913.02 --> 2921.29
switch makes no sense that's not how it

2917.73 --> 2921.29
works that's not how they work

2925.65 --> 2932.5190000000002
yeah thanks Tom Parker I'm feeling a lot

2928.689 --> 2935.019
better like doing this talking it's good

2932.519 --> 2938.109
it's funny in a way because especially

2935.019 --> 2941.439
if I don't don't talk really silently

2938.109 --> 2943.989
but if it just talked proudly that does

2941.439 --> 2946.5389999999998
kind of like resonate down I can feel

2943.989 --> 2949.719
the sound waves from my throat going

2946.539 --> 2952.119
down and it's kind of like gently

2949.719 --> 2953.859
vibrates my stomach in a pleasant way as

2952.119 --> 2957.219
well so it seems to be helping just

2953.859 --> 2960.39
talking getting it off my stomach

2957.219 --> 2960.39
through words

2962.86 --> 2965.989
[Music]

2973.6 --> 2983.92
I'm almost getting a bit hungry actually

2976.42 --> 2987.73
hmm pretty quick recovery like if I I

2983.92 --> 2990.28
feel so much better now like it's hard

2987.73 --> 2992.5
to describe how bad it was last night

2990.28 --> 2995.0800000000004
like waking up like that 4 o'clock and

2992.5 --> 2998.2
not just sweating but sweating so bad

2995.08 --> 3002.46
that you can that it prickles in your

2998.2 --> 3005.04
eyes so bad like everywhere and then

3002.46 --> 3006.63
your body just feels like the

3005.04 --> 3014.7799999999997
temperatures and everything are turned

3006.63 --> 3019.52
inside out I don't know it was terrible

3014.78 --> 3021.8100000000004
like physically mentally I wasn't like

3019.52 --> 3024.06
getting anything no it was just a

3021.81 --> 3025.2599999999998
physical experience which is terrible

3024.06 --> 3029.09
felt like I was gonna die

3025.26 --> 3033.03
I guess acute food poisoning would be

3029.09 --> 3035.3700000000003
kind of in the same level a bit its

3033.03 --> 3037.23
constitutes a experience you could

3035.37 --> 3040.0499999999997
compare it to for other people out there

3037.23 --> 3042.68
it's just pretty horrific when you're

3040.05 --> 3042.6800000000003
actually in it

3044.05 --> 3048.8990000000003
[Music]

3090.92 --> 3109.5
Zep tepi well mentality no look I don't

3105.12 --> 3113.04
think look arrogance is a universal

3109.5 --> 3115.35
problem if you're going to be doing

3113.04 --> 3118.59
something and it's like your thing or

3115.35 --> 3121.74
your profession then you're always going

3118.59 --> 3125.25
to have a like a stance especially if it

3121.74 --> 3126.8399999999997
involves communication like I am I am

3125.25 --> 3130.98
very good at this and if you then have

3126.84 --> 3135.84
an opponent then it's very typical to

3130.98 --> 3138.06
put them below you as a basic move but

3135.84 --> 3140.4
that's basic it's not very based it's

3138.06 --> 3144.38
basic behavior its basic social pay for

3140.4 --> 3146.9100000000003
yeah that's that sucks it's lame but

3144.38 --> 3148.98
yeah that's not the only thing going

3146.91 --> 3151.41
down though because the entire set up of

3148.98 --> 3153.48
awesome better than you is not equally

3151.41 --> 3156.2
spread out and in the same context

3153.48 --> 3161.22
between ballers and flat-earthers

3156.2 --> 3164.1299999999997
because flat-earthers actually do know

3161.22 --> 3167.52
things better than the ballers do they

3164.13 --> 3170.25
know their own mechanics better and they

3167.52 --> 3175.53
do actually research the machinations

3170.25 --> 3178.53
which ballers avoid so yeah there's an

3175.53 --> 3182.6400000000003
offset in the actual balance of

3178.53 --> 3185.46
knowledge so flat-earthers tend to on

3182.64 --> 3187.56
average do know things better than

3185.46 --> 3191.31
ballers now I'm not saying that some

3187.56 --> 3193.98
average guy average Joe that is happens

3191.31 --> 3195.69
to be a flat earther but it's not super

3193.98 --> 3198.72
intellectual because you don't

3195.69 --> 3201.93
necessarily have to be if they will go

3198.72 --> 3206.6699999999996
up against like a very energetic studied

3201.93 --> 3208.23
person that they will always seem to win

3206.67 --> 3214.14
or that it will always get things right

3208.23 --> 3218.22
but just on average yeah like if you're

3214.14 --> 3222.42
even as yeah a a competent research flat

3218.22 --> 3223.41
earther will defeat any university

3222.42 --> 3226.9500000000003
baller

3223.41 --> 3233.99
any single one of them every single time

3226.95 --> 3233.99
without exception without exception

3234.5 --> 3241.53
because we know what they get fed we

3238.92 --> 3243.839
know the baller machinations we know how

3241.53 --> 3247.829
they have been taught to think what

3243.839 --> 3249.9
their arguments will be and even the

3247.829 --> 3251.9100000000003
