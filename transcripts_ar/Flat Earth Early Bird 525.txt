135.97 --> 141.22
flashes for coming from it in the

139.209 --> 145.72

and yeah when Ken wove it was some

145.72 --> 153.16
serious lightning going on oh yeah it's

Voynich that a meetin

270.99 --> 281.49
yeah good to see you all right

275.47 --> 281.49
so I had a very busy afternoon yesterday

281.64 --> 288.52
lots of stress e stuff so yesterday was

285.22 --> 292.03000000000003
kind of a day of chaos and it wasn't it

288.52 --> 298.87
seemed kind of synchronize up with the

292.03 --> 303.59999999999997
huge storm so I I got some stories so

298.87 --> 303.6
yesterday of course as we all know

303.9 --> 309.13
mind-warped got on here basically just

307.51 --> 310.09
called me up out of nowhere and I

309.13 --> 312.55
thought yeah why not

310.09 --> 313.23999999999995
you know mind-warped he is kind of a

312.55 --> 315.88
nice guy

313.24 --> 318.82
but he was in a weird mood yesterday and

315.88 --> 321.25
he even said in my chat earlier that he

318.82 --> 324.4
was gonna have a wodka now he lives in

321.25 --> 327.85
Australia so it was in the evening but

324.4 --> 329.91999999999996
yeah this most of you probably have

327.85 --> 335.05
caught on like that went completely

329.92 --> 338.77000000000004
wrong and during the debates even I yeah

335.05 --> 342.72
I eventually like really try to address

338.77 --> 346.65999999999997
him because he was out of control he

342.72 --> 349.75
like he couldn't stop himself from rum

346.66 --> 351.64000000000004
pausing like and it wasn't even like

349.75 --> 355.36
something that he wanted to do he just

351.64 --> 356.97999999999996
he was being oppositional EDA fined for

355.36 --> 359.02000000000004
no good reason about the Black Swan

356.98 --> 361.57
first we did and it was kind of a good

359.02 --> 363.389
story that came out of it but then just

361.57 --> 368.32
got worse and worse and

363.389 --> 370.87
yeah it feels in retrospect like really

368.32 --> 372.79
annoying because he did start out on my

370.87 --> 373.63
show giving me all these super chats and

372.79 --> 376.3
was pretty awesome

373.63 --> 379.0
and yeah he was a bit rum Percy but he's

376.3 --> 380.83
always like that and I didn't mind you

379.0 --> 383.919
know it's on my show and I don't know it

380.83 --> 387.09999999999997
was nice to do that that thing with the

383.919 --> 391.69
map and all just compared to visuals and

387.1 --> 394.06
uh but yeah then it ended like that and

391.69 --> 397.24
I pretty much just told him to shut the

394.06 --> 401.05
[ __ ] up like put a cork in it seriously

397.24 --> 403.69
did and he just no he was just rambling

401.05 --> 405.21000000000004
and couldn't get out of it and was kind

403.69 --> 408.25
of sad

405.21 --> 410.53
yeah you know I didn't yell at him

408.25 --> 413.28
because I I know think he's a total dick

410.53 --> 419.88
now I think he would just lost control

413.28 --> 419.88
vodka probably didn't help snow Voynich

424.83 --> 437.169
know what why would i swear in dutch but

434.02 --> 439.57
yeah that happened and he got like

437.169 --> 444.25
really pissed off in skype - i know they

439.57 --> 447.31
were gonna share that it's just so i

444.25 --> 449.02
hope things work out with that did he

447.31 --> 450.91
mentions - calm down I don't know man

449.02 --> 453.039
what's going on with him but he's a very

450.91 --> 455.68
sensitive guy and yet this kind of thing

453.039 --> 458.32
happens he's done that kind of thing

455.68 --> 463.71
before or it just loses control and this

458.32 --> 468.09
shoots off in just crazy tangents

463.71 --> 472.81
[Music]

468.09 --> 475.15
okay Rhett please priestly anyway yeah

472.81 --> 477.49
my friend also called me up when we

475.15 --> 480.60999999999996
talked for freaking three-and-a-half

477.49 --> 483.19
hours because she really needed it and

480.61 --> 486.25
my friend and I may have more stories

483.19 --> 491.56
about that freaking ex-boyfriend of her

486.25 --> 497.11
father of her kids oh it's like making

491.56 --> 498.52
me a bit nervous because yeah she's just

497.11 --> 503.52000000000004
pretty tense about the whole situation

498.52 --> 506.46999999999997
and she's been really working on kind of

503.52 --> 508.87
using my example because I talk the way

506.47 --> 512.7090000000001
I talk over here very openly deeply

508.87 --> 517.719
about psychologic psychology and she is

512.709 --> 520.959
very smart like really smart probably to

517.719 --> 524.47
my level but just crystallized in

520.959 --> 525.7299999999999
another type of life she needs to use it

524.47 --> 529.3000000000001
all the time but she also gets

525.73 --> 533.1700000000001
distracted all the time and anyway she's

529.3 --> 534.64
like been really reflecting inside of

533.17 --> 537.61
just what's going on what's the

534.64 --> 540.31
situation and with her kid who's also

537.61 --> 544.27
just starting to kind of already get

540.31 --> 548.829
it's just - and she's already so smart

544.27 --> 551.8
that she's getting like her kid yeah

548.829 --> 554.29
this is this is kind of speculative you

551.8 --> 559.06
know and but it's like that kid so smart

554.29 --> 561.31
so sharp already and dad is nuts and she

559.06 --> 562.93
knows what's going on and she knows her

561.31 --> 567.3699999999999
mother is over pressure too but she's

562.93 --> 570.52
just like impatient it sounds familiar

567.37 --> 574.12
to me you know it's like no this needs

570.52 --> 575.98
to change but she's - so she's kind of

574.12 --> 578.29
like self-consciously almost trying to

575.98 --> 581.9200000000001
coup the city like she's trying to

578.29 --> 583.329
literally become the Queen right I guess

581.92 --> 583.87
this type of thing is probably more

583.329 --> 585.76
normal

583.87 --> 588.13
Nathan probably knows a thing or two

585.76 --> 593.02
about this because he has girls little

588.13 --> 595.12
girls but yeah he is also you had two

593.02 --> 596.709
parents you know it's very important and

595.12 --> 598.87
he's been a lot about discipline and

596.709 --> 600.64
like you could see that especially early

598.87 --> 603.16
on and that's good and

600.64 --> 605.59
fortunately my friend does not have a

603.16 --> 609.03
dad around to be like that and her dad

605.59 --> 615.85
just like completely nuts like

609.03 --> 620.4399999999999
dangerously nuts and yeah so she's in a

615.85 --> 622.5400000000001
tough spot now my friend and had a lot

620.44 --> 625.87
to talk about it and I almost felt like

622.54 --> 628.68
[ __ ] man I it's almost like I feel that

625.87 --> 633.01
my honor would kind of force me to just

628.68 --> 635.38
go to her and like set up camp like I

633.01 --> 644.14
have to freaking defend her and just

635.38 --> 647.68
help her fix this [ __ ] because so I'm

644.14 --> 650.41
yeah I'm not gonna entirely sure but at

647.68 --> 652.75
some point I don't know I made just like

650.41 --> 655.36
a halt the early bird show for a period

652.75 --> 657.07
and go there for like two weeks just

655.36 --> 661.0
like a working vacation or something

657.07 --> 664.0600000000001
because I don't know if I don't then she

661.0 --> 670.48
might like literally just lose it from

664.06 --> 676.89
the stress the NARC trap what are you

670.48 --> 678.9300000000001
talking about anyway

676.89 --> 682.01
the most Chairman's speak English I

678.93 --> 684.5699999999999
didn't know probably not Missouri bear

682.01 --> 689.52
not as many as Dutch people speak

684.57 --> 692.4300000000001
English anyway

689.52 --> 704.4
yeah doubt that another crazy situation

692.43 --> 709.89
going on still terrible of narcissist

704.4 --> 711.99
gnarrk gnarrk is that really what that's

709.89 --> 716.9
because I always thought that a narc was

711.99 --> 716.9
like a today

721.19 --> 723.85
you call it

724.03 --> 733.53
like somebody that like I did say like a

730.24 --> 736.42
spy for the government to seek out drug

733.53 --> 740.35
drug deals I thought that was a narc I

736.42 --> 741.13
may be exactly like a spy that's how I

740.35 --> 754.3000000000001
learned it

741.13 --> 756.1899999999999
oh that's with a k' all right anyway why

754.3 --> 757.5999999999999
don't you bring your friends to yours

756.19 --> 766.0300000000001
get her on the show

757.6 --> 770.2
Oh God well that sounds like a nice idea

766.03 --> 772.81
of Dell West Watson but look there I

770.2 --> 775.1500000000001
kind of did invite her like hey maybe

772.81 --> 778.75
you would like to coast come here like

775.15 --> 780.67
in the summer for a day you know because

778.75 --> 783.25
there's a really nice playground out

780.67 --> 786.25
there and but she's not gonna come on

783.25 --> 787.9
camera I think no she's like way too

786.25 --> 795.52
stressed out and she's very

787.9 --> 798.88
self-conscious and like she's like like

795.52 --> 800.5
she has you this sounds really rough but

798.88 --> 802.63
she used to have a very elaborate social

800.5 --> 805.51
life before kit now she's fine with how

802.63 --> 808.06
it's changed but that she's very

805.51 --> 810.31
self-conscious and then yeah she

808.06 --> 815.1999999999999
probably be like oh god I feel so

810.31 --> 817.9899999999999
stressed out like I don't want to yeah

815.2 --> 821.2800000000001
show all my garbage basically there have

817.99 --> 824.5
been collecting because of the stressful

821.28 --> 826.2099999999999
situation type of thing so it's very

824.5 --> 828.85
it's very smart very self conscious

826.21 --> 831.82
person although you know maybe in the

828.85 --> 835.33
future it will get to that because she's

831.82 --> 839.8000000000001
also a very devout truth or and very

835.33 --> 842.23
spiritual person but they're not like

839.8 --> 845.77
not so focused but that's also because

842.23 --> 849.1
she is just so busy putting all her

845.77 --> 849.91
energy in into her kid and in her

849.1 --> 853.86
situation

849.91 --> 853.86
upholding a household and all that

854.12 --> 856.749
anyway

863.13 --> 866.1899999999999
[Music]

873.55 --> 880.8
okay talking about languages now and

878.17 --> 880.8
shad I see

885.26 --> 890.81
all right

887.339 --> 890.8100000000001
lower light energy

891.14 --> 894.309
[Music]

901.75 --> 908.11
what okay Hannah koala that's a an odd

905.92 --> 911.3499999999999
question would you rather be covered in

908.11 --> 914.65
fur or scales well that depends on where

911.35 --> 915.91
I would be living I think that the

914.65 --> 919.12
further north you go

915.91 --> 921.55
you'd probably appreciate some fur you

919.12 --> 923.08
know because if you don't have it

921.55 --> 926.41
there's a likelihood that you're going

923.08 --> 929.11
to want to have it in your coats built

926.41 --> 931.42
in it so if you'd have your own that

929.11 --> 934.27
would be pretty convenient but then

931.42 --> 942.88
again if you're in a much hotter region

934.27 --> 945.9399999999999
then skills would probably be nicer but

942.88 --> 948.97
yeah with skills also I think just with

945.94 --> 952.6600000000001
typical reptilians it's kind of you

948.97 --> 955.36
become more yeah what is it

952.66 --> 960.16
very variable in the temperature of your

955.36 --> 961.96
body like they become cold blooded is

960.16 --> 963.9399999999999
what the terminology is so that they can

961.96 --> 966.2800000000001
literally cool off and then they slow

963.94 --> 969.25
down slow down until they'll almost like

966.28 --> 971.05
get into a train to a coma state from

969.25 --> 974.43
which they can wake up again if they

971.05 --> 977.89
warm up and they can take extreme heat

974.43 --> 980.16
like reptilians can really take hot

977.89 --> 980.16
situations

987.84 --> 994.2900000000001
the firend skills mom dad and mine

991.56 --> 998.7299999999999
that's that sounds like a bit nutty

994.29 --> 1007.43
there Voynich a sleeping warrior how are

998.73 --> 1014.779
you doing it's uh how's the research

1007.43 --> 1022.4599999999999
project I've been keeping track of your

1014.779 --> 1024.709
videos so that's a pretty tense

1022.46 --> 1029.05
situation there with the with Randy and

1024.709 --> 1029.05
Roxanne and and all that

1032.3 --> 1035.869
[Music]

1043.79 --> 1051.01
that is why you don't walk under trees

1047.27 --> 1058.54
in Miami on a cold morning okay

1051.01 --> 1066.17
what exactly you're referring to

1058.54 --> 1069.1
reptiles not sure what you're talking

1066.17 --> 1069.1000000000001
about there acaba

1073.53 --> 1076.58
like what

1078.36 --> 1084.87
so realist is now of course 35 years

1081.69 --> 1086.45
after the fact what what are you talking

1084.87 --> 1090.7099999999998
about

1086.45 --> 1090.71
am I missing something here

1102.08 --> 1117.09
[Music]

1105.09 --> 1119.61
okay I know is there a big delay well

1117.09 --> 1120.509
yeah there is like a eight second delay

1119.61 --> 1125.129
or something

1120.509 --> 1127.169
damn okay I'll keep that in mind there's

1125.129 --> 1131.509
been a lot of delay recently even though

1127.169 --> 1131.509
OBS does not delay it

1138.049 --> 1142.759
language has become an identity factor

1140.669 --> 1145.759
we no longer use and I find that bad

1142.759 --> 1145.759
really

1148.7 --> 1158.509
okay I kind of disagree Missouri bear

1152.45 --> 1162.45
because languages bring their own unique

1158.509 --> 1165.09
yeah culture with it like the way a

1162.45 --> 1169.8590000000002
person starts to think and express

1165.09 --> 1173.33
themselves is greatly influenced by the

1169.859 --> 1176.489
base language they'll they grow up with

1173.33 --> 1181.32
like a different code the difference

1176.489 --> 1184.08
language is 10 - yeah they become

1181.32 --> 1187.2
different resonating with that language

1184.08 --> 1189.869
it's just there's more to language than

1187.2 --> 1193.7
just being able to communicate

1189.869 --> 1195.749
separately there is different types of

1193.7 --> 1198.299
characteristics that come with the

1195.749 --> 1205.099
language that ingrained themselves in

1198.299 --> 1211.109
the people that speak it Luise

1205.099 --> 1213.599
so anyone want to come on the party just

1211.109 --> 1215.509
have a nice chat nothing special I'm all

1213.599 --> 1218.849
open for that you know

1215.509 --> 1224.489
so hey maybe Ethan wants to come on or

1218.849 --> 1226.889
maybe Tony maybe you want to share

1224.489 --> 1230.039
something some deep details talk through

1226.889 --> 1236.4789999999998
things although not too extremely

1230.039 --> 1236.479
gossipy please if you're up for it

1242.35 --> 1250.6
maybe in 20 minutes okay all right we'll

1248.59 --> 1252.97
see ya there's a big chance in 20

1250.6 --> 1254.4099999999999
minutes I'll already be talking more

1252.97 --> 1256.799
elaborately about something that I came

1254.41 --> 1256.799
up with

1269.89 --> 1273.279
[Music]

1275.71 --> 1280.27
oh yeah I figured out something really

1278.32 --> 1283.06
funny just a little detail thingy

1280.27 --> 1286.06
nothing it's not really that interesting

1283.06 --> 1288.49
but yeah I'm I'm kind of having trouble

1286.06 --> 1290.1399999999999
with that stupid lamp over there I need

1288.49 --> 1294.3700000000001
to replace it because the thing is like

1290.14 --> 1296.3500000000001
constantly flashing at times it it feels

1294.37 --> 1298.4799999999998
like it's like a robot and it's like

1296.35 --> 1300.3999999999999
trying to [ __ ] with my mind or something

1298.48 --> 1303.34
sometimes because it just keeps flashing

1300.4 --> 1305.6200000000001
but then it keeps on going again it

1303.34 --> 1309.85
doesn't it's not like the last break

1305.62 --> 1311.9699999999998
type of flash because it just keeps on

1309.85 --> 1315.25
going it doesn't make any sense so

1311.97 --> 1318.46
[ __ ] up but then I figured out wait I

1315.25 --> 1324.4
have this desk lamp here that I got like

1318.46 --> 1328.39
last year and I can actually bend it

1324.4 --> 1330.52
upwards and then have like a line upward

1328.39 --> 1331.68
and that seemed to be just a lot of

1330.52 --> 1334.48
lights

1331.68 --> 1336.6100000000001
so it's like oh wait I fixed it I had

1334.48 --> 1340.3600000000001
the solution already there then I just

1336.61 --> 1343.84
didn't realize it yet and I find this

1340.36 --> 1349.09
lighting just this desk light even up

1343.84 --> 1351.07
work like this I actually find this

1349.09 --> 1353.4399999999998
light yeah you don't even see it now

1351.07 --> 1361.3899999999999
during the day what it's actually very

1353.44 --> 1368.02
pleasant type of like the solution was

1361.39 --> 1373.39
always there if it's LED I know what's

1368.02 --> 1376.12
going on yeah perhaps yeah it might be

1373.39 --> 1380.5600000000002
the internet-of-things type of situation

1376.12 --> 1382.84
I've been worried about that but yeah

1380.56 --> 1386.86
you know when the lamp breaks I get a

1382.84 --> 1388.9299999999998
new one and yeah there's only so much I

1386.86 --> 1393.58
can pick from and now they had other

1388.93 --> 1397.8400000000001
types of LED lights that didn't do it

1393.58 --> 1400.81
like this not like this so yeah I've

1397.84 --> 1403.51
been using this thing for two months and

1400.81 --> 1406.4199999999998
it's kept flickering like from the

1403.51 --> 1407.8
second day on it's kind of weird that I

1406.42 --> 1412.63
just left it like that

1407.8 --> 1414.22
I in retrospect I kind of just need to

1412.63 --> 1416.3200000000002
take it out and bring it back to the

1414.22 --> 1420.13
store and say like this thing is messed

1416.32 --> 1423.84
up maybe I can get it you had a new one

1420.13 --> 1423.8400000000001
that won't be as bad and I don't know

1436.42 --> 1442.72
[Music]

1437.8 --> 1442.72
yes Missouri bear you're probably right

1447.36 --> 1456.6999999999998
LED light bulbs what are you talking

1450.58 --> 1464.4299999999998
about a random Explorer Oh le deed right

1456.7 --> 1464.43

1464.56 --> 1467.609
[Music]

1481.299 --> 1485.48

1485.48 --> 1489.3700000000001
that this is totally Riley's thing

1509.48 --> 1512.26
hmm

1520.23 --> 1527.059
that's right Jim Jones that's how I feel

1522.809 --> 1530.1589999999999
about it too you know Tony is always yep

1527.059 --> 1533.999
basically testing and digging into

1530.159 --> 1536.009
situations and biting into people if he

1533.999 --> 1538.3500000000001
feels like it and this is what he does

1536.009 --> 1540.929
this life I just watch his videos it's

1538.35 --> 1543.059
like a lot of them are exactly that and

1540.929 --> 1545.19
I don't know he does it very other

1543.059 --> 1547.499
quickly and he's very careful and it's

1545.19 --> 1555.239
interesting what I could get got to

1547.499 --> 1557.429
learn from him doing all that the drama

1555.239 --> 1574.409
club is killing it these days huh

1557.429 --> 1578.1000000000001
right he's a mouse key all right and hey

1574.409 --> 1581.669
you know think of him what you will you

1578.1 --> 1583.559
know but Tony doesn't slander so it's

1581.669 --> 1585.72
very careful and he said always very

1583.559 --> 1588.6789999999999
even apologetic sometimes a little bit

1585.72 --> 1592.55
too apologetic in my opinion but it's

1588.679 --> 1595.68
it's how he does things

1592.55 --> 1595.68
[Music]

1601.51 --> 1613.87
Wow okay really

1605.82 --> 1618.1
that's an expected sleeping where no

1613.87 --> 1622.12
what who would just who would justify

1618.1 --> 1625.3899999999999
somebody breaking their word that's are

1622.12 --> 1631.4189999999999
you sure that's not some mistake

1625.39 --> 1637.6000000000001
it's a miscommunication there or where

1631.419 --> 1640.5900000000001
it was it just trolls those trolls will

1637.6 --> 1640.59
say whatever you know

1659.14 --> 1664.23
mmm

1661.26 --> 1667.3799999999999
all right well good servant you get

1664.23 --> 1674.49
there remember when I started up it took

1667.38 --> 1676.5900000000001
me like how long was that - two and a

1674.49 --> 1680.04
half or three years or something before

1676.59 --> 1682.5
I got to a thousand and liked it it

1680.04 --> 1686.37
always grows very slowly at the start

1682.5 --> 1688.38
it always does unless you just really

1686.37 --> 1691.53
hit the right snare on all fronts and

1688.38 --> 1694.0800000000002
that rarely happens with people when

1691.53 --> 1695.97
they entered the scene unless they've

1694.08 --> 1697.71
been looking for a long time and really

1695.97 --> 1702.3500000000001
have a big plan they've been working on

1697.71 --> 1702.3500000000001
and then come up with that

1711.19 --> 1720.42
hey James Mason good to see you man and

1716.52 --> 1720.42
dinosaur fart okay

1733.05 --> 1738.22
[Music]

1744.84 --> 1747.9199999999998
[Music]

1749.75 --> 1760.98
Joseph Collett a debit card

1753.24 --> 1763.08
I don't know sorry that doesn't PayPal

1760.98 --> 1766.169
take that I know if you want to send me

1763.08 --> 1770.549
money mend and I really appreciate the

1766.169 --> 1777.2990000000002
gesture at least yep PayPal is the best

1770.549 --> 1780.36
way to do it I don't know about cards

1777.299 --> 1783.45
but you know with banks and these types

1780.36 --> 1794.7299999999998
of payment systems it usually is kind of

1783.45 --> 1798.51
flexible but I don't know for sure yeah

1794.73 --> 1800.07
do not super chat like only super chat

1798.51 --> 1803.039
if you if you want to use it as a

1800.07 --> 1806.1
billboard you know or if yeah in a way

1803.039 --> 1809.34
super chatting does help again but it is

1806.1 --> 1812.73
more for the stats of my YouTube

1809.34 --> 1814.62
activities so it's like yeah this guy is

1812.73 --> 1816.8700000000001
making money that's what it does mostly

1814.62 --> 1820.289
doesn't really effectively help my

1816.87 --> 1822.2399999999998
financial situation if you want to do

1820.289 --> 1827.76
that then PayPal is always the best

1822.24 --> 1832.1
option at the moment because I get the

1827.76 --> 1832.1
full amount and I get it the quickest

1834.4 --> 1842.3500000000001
all right well yeah try out PayPal I

1838.49 --> 1842.35
don't know if that's an option for you

1843.9 --> 1847.009
[Music]

1859.03 --> 1873.16
uh okay Missouri bear what's that for

1870.49 --> 1877.21
milk typical reflections who's that

1873.16 --> 1881.98
Oh God

1877.21 --> 1885.79
oh one of those you mean a ball a

1881.98 --> 1889.42
pathetic baller attempt to try to derail

1885.79 --> 1894.07
his yeah his photographic work that kind

1889.42 --> 1896.38
of hit piece yeah that's plenty of those

1894.07 --> 1898.1499999999999
Missouri bear there's a lot of ballers

1896.38 --> 1901.2
that have been very triggered by rant

1898.15 --> 1901.2
ISA video work

1910.23 --> 1915.57
link PayPal to your bank boom done yeah

1912.96 --> 1918.24
Georgia that's the easiest way to do it

1915.57 --> 1921.4199999999998
but maybe PayPal can be also linked to

1918.24 --> 1923.43
other types of systems like debit cards

1921.42 --> 1925.5
like he mentioned I don't know I've

1923.43 --> 1929.5800000000002
never tried it I always avoided that

1925.5 --> 1932.01
kind of thing right ah Thank You drunken

1929.58 --> 1933.8999999999999
bullet for one one for the two it's

1932.01 --> 1936.81
Australian dollar superjet donation this

1933.9 --> 1940.88
is not for aunty okay I'll make sure to

1936.81 --> 1944.79
not donate it as soon as it comes in to

1940.88 --> 1947.48
Randy I'm I promise and now actually

1944.79 --> 1947.48
keep that promise

1952.91 --> 1965.14
[Music]

1959.71 --> 1968.5900000000001
oh look okay and the snark I didn't know

1965.14 --> 1970.3000000000002
that yeah I just decide I don't want to

1968.59 --> 1972.79
listen you know I don't want audio of

1970.3 --> 1974.98
other people's feet videos especially if

1972.79 --> 1978.8799999999999
they're kind of hostile they might

1974.98 --> 1981.91
strike me or that kind of nonsense so I

1978.88 --> 1984.3700000000001
just wanted to I flicked through the

1981.91 --> 1987.94
visual saw the camerawork assumed it was

1984.37 --> 1990.6
one of those but I guess it is about the

1987.94 --> 1993.1000000000001
funding for the PETA 1000 and the drone

1990.6 --> 1995.7099999999998
because there has been some rumors going

1993.1 --> 1999.2199999999998
around about that as well a lot of it

1995.71 --> 2001.77
and yeah there is something to it I did

1999.22 --> 2003.96
but I've had my weird little suspicion

2001.77 --> 2009.3899999999999
that it might actually be Randy just

2003.96 --> 2013.14
playing a game with people no it could

2009.39 --> 2015.6000000000001
be though that yeah because he he's

2013.14 --> 2018.72
trying to create controversy about him

2015.6 --> 2021.2099999999998
so it's like it's a tactic to keep

2018.72 --> 2023.4
people focused on what's going on with

2021.21 --> 2026.1200000000001
you and that draws in more views and

2023.4 --> 2029.3300000000002
it's like a way to get momentum and

2026.12 --> 2032.55
probably have had all the clearances or

2029.33 --> 2035.8799999999999
the proper channel connections and all

2032.55 --> 2038.1
that behind the scenes in order to do

2035.88 --> 2042.14
that so it could be that he he did

2038.1 --> 2044.6699999999998
nothing really devious but he's just

2042.14 --> 2046.41
trying to create it as a secret

2044.67 --> 2048.9900000000002
conspiracy about himself you know that

2046.41 --> 2049.7400000000002
could be the case I'd see him capable of

2048.99 --> 2055.83
doing that

2049.74 --> 2058.5299999999997
trickery so I don't know that's why I

2055.83 --> 2061.65
say the whole funding for the drone in

2058.53 --> 2064.0800000000004
the p1000 it is rumors and it might be

2061.65 --> 2068.52
rumors basically that he likes I don't

2064.08 --> 2070.56
know I you know i've said i've given my

2068.52 --> 2076.38
analysis over who I think Randy really

2070.56 --> 2079.2799999999997
is how he works and yeah that should

2076.38 --> 2079.28
tell you enough

2080.23 --> 2088.81
ah Thank You ma UK for that 199 pound

2085.99 --> 2099.22
super chat donation just speak truth yes

2088.81 --> 2103.29
of course man of course although I do

2099.22 --> 2106.39
get sarcastic sometimes and that's oh

2103.29 --> 2108.4
yeah that you gotta be careful with that

2106.39 --> 2113.3489999999997
and I noticed it myself I do it on the

2108.4 --> 2115.69
debates it's weird in a way and that's

2113.349 --> 2120.4
this is my thing you know because I'm

2115.69 --> 2122.7400000000002
always I get bored with things if it's

2120.4 --> 2124.089
like repeated too many times even though

2122.74 --> 2125.6499999999996
it's good if you know it's kind of

2124.089 --> 2127.66
necessary that happens for me personally

2125.65 --> 2130.8
I guess I mean I want to do something

2127.66 --> 2133.8689999999997
and then sometimes I get sarcastic and

2130.8 --> 2137.099
then sometimes that certainly can turn

2133.869 --> 2139.3900000000003
me into a emulated baller like that

2137.099 --> 2141.25
because I'm very good at it I'm just

2139.39 --> 2150.25
afraid that if I go into that act too

2141.25 --> 2151.96
much I'll like do too well I might yeah

2150.25 --> 2154.27
it's already I've already figured out

2151.96 --> 2158.14
certain types of angles of arguments

2154.27 --> 2161.65
that the ballers really haven't touched

2158.14 --> 2165.52
upon too much but I know I'm good at

2161.65 --> 2168.73
this baller nonsense I know how it works

2165.52 --> 2172.06
I can do that and I'm almost getting

2168.73 --> 2175.39
seduced to do it just out of boredom but

2172.06 --> 2178.99
I don't want that not yet you know first

2175.39 --> 2180.42
I need a certain six million euro

2178.99 --> 2182.9199999999996
donation

2180.42 --> 2183.64
sorry not never gonna happen this that's

2182.92 --> 2186.849
a joke

2183.64 --> 2191.68
although yeah if it happened I'd freak

2186.849 --> 2193.98
out but I I suspect that's not gonna be

2191.68 --> 2193.98
the case

2196.16 --> 2199.199
[Music]

2199.76 --> 2204.32
you said it donated to Randy

2213.42 --> 2221.73
right Guns of Navarone RFP I get that

2218.48 --> 2224.04
well that's kind of you got though

2221.73 --> 2226.98
realize that that is how it works you

2224.04 --> 2228.39
know if you donate to somebody you

2226.98 --> 2230.76
really got to keep in mind that you're

2228.39 --> 2235.41
donating well perhaps with the hopes or

2230.76 --> 2238.5600000000004
the future but it's also how I would do

2235.41 --> 2242.0699999999997
it is really to reward for what they've

2238.56 --> 2244.23
done and to honor what they've done

2242.07 --> 2248.09
because there's a lot of people

2244.23 --> 2250.5
especially very talented one that often

2248.09 --> 2253.83
reach a point where they do kind of

2250.5 --> 2256.71
trance transform into another approach

2253.83 --> 2259.14
more like an exit strategy this is this

2256.71 --> 2262.14
is what kind of does happen a lot in

2259.14 --> 2265.67
media world you know they yeah you could

2262.14 --> 2269.43
also say they turn into a grappler and

2265.67 --> 2271.6800000000003
yeah you can then punish yourself for

2269.43 --> 2277.3199999999997
having given them money because they

2271.68 --> 2280.5299999999997
were doing good and it's also not good

2277.32 --> 2283.5
to try to fool yourself in thinking that

2280.53 --> 2286.7900000000004
the way they're misbehaving or whatever

2283.5 --> 2292.68
are changed for the worst isn't real

2286.79 --> 2294.54
that's not good either so yeah no ranty

2292.68 --> 2296.64
is doing what randy does hey if you like

2294.54 --> 2299.58
that what he's doing right now then hey

2296.64 --> 2301.3199999999997
by all means support it you know but if

2299.58 --> 2303.18
you're trying to support him in the

2301.32 --> 2307.53
hopes that you'll turn back in the old

2303.18 --> 2311.8199999999997
fashioned ranty that I wouldn't I

2307.53 --> 2314.36
wouldn't waste my money on that that's

2311.82 --> 2314.36
just it

2317.84 --> 2323.46
when Randy starts giving interviews on

2321.03 --> 2325.65
mainstream media no it's gonna be a

2323.46 --> 2337.23
total plant if he does that I'm pretty

2325.65 --> 2338.75
sure it that I don't know man I don't

2337.23 --> 2341.79
even know if that would happen like that

2338.75 --> 2343.59
but I just don't know man with Randy

2341.79 --> 2346.08
like it could be anything it could be

2343.59 --> 2352.26
like one day one way another day another

2346.08 --> 2355.11
way I don't know I don't even know if he

2352.26 --> 2357.0600000000004
knows what he's doing I think he just

2355.11 --> 2359.19
wants to become bigger and get more

2357.06 --> 2361.92
attention and make more money it I think

2359.19 --> 2367.9500000000003
that's really the only thing that drives

2361.92 --> 2370.4700000000003
his vision and yeah he he is creative

2367.95 --> 2372.93
enough that he does bring up it just

2370.47 --> 2374.9399999999996
does come up with new ideas of things to

2372.93 --> 2379.58
do and everything no he's not an

2374.94 --> 2379.58
untalented guy I would never say that

2380.0 --> 2385.97
and he's proven that he's capable of

2383.22 --> 2391.1099999999997
doing all kinds of things good research

2385.97 --> 2394.4399999999996
yeah tenacious field work capable of

2391.11 --> 2397.92
loyalty if he yeah if he chooses so but

2394.44 --> 2402.2400000000002
then again also yeah if shown that he's

2397.92 --> 2405.09
definitely has like a will of his own

2402.24 --> 2409.0499999999997
and it's extremely unpredictable and he

2405.09 --> 2412.77
can let himself slide into very bad

2409.05 --> 2415.7400000000002
social territory and then be extremely

2412.77 --> 2419.54
unapologetic about it and then when he

2415.74 --> 2423.3599999999997
feels like it he's you know men back up

2419.54 --> 2427.35
and basically be like no no no it's a no

2423.36 --> 2428.88
I it'll be all right and then kind of go

2427.35 --> 2434.0099999999998
through the same cycle again and the

2428.88 --> 2436.79
same thing happens so yeah it's a

2434.01 --> 2436.7900000000004
complicated guy

2437.4 --> 2455.1600000000003
God be careful I gotta be careful he is

2451.799 --> 2459.719
a whale of his own really I don't know

2455.16 --> 2460.04
this hurt and he's not a big guy too you

2459.719 --> 2463.23
know

2460.04 --> 2463.23
[Music]

2471.55 --> 2477.8700000000003
but yeah I'm not gonna hold that over

2474.61 --> 2477.8700000000003
him that his head you know

2481.68 --> 2484.8799999999997
[Music]

2491.03 --> 2501.6200000000003
no I'm okay yeah no but Randy yeah

2496.27 --> 2506.3
that's like he is conducting a YouTube

2501.62 --> 2508.8399999999997
business in his own fashion and he keeps

2506.3 --> 2508.84
it going

2523.78 --> 2530.1600000000003
property investment really Wow that's

2527.92 --> 2530.16
bizarre

2540.25 --> 2545.5
yes Jim Jones you're very right I know

2543.13 --> 2549.01
that's why I say I try to be very

2545.5 --> 2554.77
careful with him I try to be honest and

2549.01 --> 2556.9
then not lay pile on extra negativity if

2554.77 --> 2559.65
I can prevent it because it's no use

2556.9 --> 2559.65
doing that

2565.41 --> 2576.45
Randy gets to a global audience does he

2568.229 --> 2578.989
I don't know you know right if you say

2576.45 --> 2581.609
that Jack six five three six five three

2578.989 --> 2584.5190000000002
then yeah you could also consider that I

2581.609 --> 2588.749
get to a global audience - I have Globus

2584.519 --> 2590.16
in my chat that are open about it and

2588.749 --> 2592.47
that are yeah

2590.16 --> 2595.3199999999997
well-behaved and just they get they

2592.47 --> 2596.9599999999996
understand what this platform is for

2595.32 --> 2599.2200000000003
[Music]

2596.96 --> 2606.21
thank you by the way the snark for the

2599.22 --> 2608.1499999999996
two-pound super chat donation it's

2606.21 --> 2612.45
basically saying in touch

2608.15 --> 2615.4500000000003
get a small beer from this I will thank

2612.45 --> 2619.3999999999996
you I can actually get a decent sized

2615.45 --> 2623.8489999999997
beer for that although yeah wait 140

2619.4 --> 2626.42
right yeah that's exactly a standard

2623.849 --> 2628.7690000000002
beer for me that's funny

2626.42 --> 2631.259
although yeah it's gonna be taken out of

2628.769 --> 2634.3689999999997
whatever I like the gesture thank you

2631.259 --> 2634.369
for the super chat donation

2643.5 --> 2648.51
what rude earth they're come on man

2648.57 --> 2655.15
don't be like that

2650.88 --> 2657.51
you know I said thanks this is

2655.15 --> 2660.9100000000003
ridiculous

2657.51 --> 2662.7700000000004
look you see I don't know why

2660.91 --> 2666.2799999999997
look the ballers have been trawling me

2662.77 --> 2668.71
about this and you and other grantee

2666.28 --> 2677.8900000000003
fans I guess are doing that it doesn't

2668.71 --> 2680.29
stupid look I've been very eloquent with

2677.89 --> 2684.79
ranty okay considering everything that's

2680.29 --> 2685.54
happened between us just as I do with

2684.79 --> 2688.87
Nathan

2685.54 --> 2691.63
I'm just open and direct and yet Nathan

2688.87 --> 2694.93
gets it okay he gets it Nathan is

2691.63 --> 2698.53
freaking smart too and among other

2694.93 --> 2702.04
things it gets it that so if you get

2698.53 --> 2704.86
criticized by me if you pay attention

2702.04 --> 2710.89
you might learn something it gets it I

2704.86 --> 2712.81
love it and even though we have certain

2710.89 --> 2716.7999999999997
type of differences of pig in here and

2712.81 --> 2720.07
there it just understands me and they

2716.8 --> 2722.59
greatly appreciate that because he knows

2720.07 --> 2726.8700000000003
that what I do I always try to do for

2722.59 --> 2726.8700000000003
the betterment of whoever I talk about

2726.99 --> 2734.02
it's like even with the most tragic of

2730.12 --> 2735.94
crazy ballers I always try to find some

2734.02 --> 2740.83
kind of purpose or a positive thing

2735.94 --> 2743.9500000000003
about them in some way and if I can't

2740.83 --> 2746.08
then I just try to make fun of what they

2743.95 --> 2749.68
are and then hope that that fun will

2746.08 --> 2751.45
kind of poke them enough that they might

2749.68 --> 2755.0499999999997
consider doing something about those

2751.45 --> 2757.8999999999996
traits so even like when I make

2755.05 --> 2760.7200000000003
ridiculous fun of somebody I try to help

2757.9 --> 2763.15
them out really because I have to a must

2760.72 --> 2765.3999999999996
it's part of the path it's the mindset

2763.15 --> 2767.59
is critical it doesn't mean that I don't

2765.4 --> 2771.01
have needs and I don't need like tension

2767.59 --> 2774.3
relief of sorts and just purposeful

2771.01 --> 2774.3
social interaction

2776.859 --> 2783.469
but the intention is critical for me for

2781.009 --> 2789.22
my focus for where my mind will wander

2783.469 --> 2793.46
into it's critical right

2789.22 --> 2793.4599999999996
[Music]

2796.98 --> 2805.11
I said get rocks indirectly okay so you

2800.46 --> 2811.32
agree we're good rude earther didn't

2805.11 --> 2814.5
happen what's really rude Arthur you

2811.32 --> 2817.6800000000003
think so but what about the voice

2814.5 --> 2823.86
recording that he did say that you think

2817.68 --> 2828.2999999999997
that Tony edit did that or something

2823.86 --> 2833.84
really didn't seem very edited there's a

2828.3 --> 2835.59
full flow pretty much is just come on

2833.84 --> 2837.69
yeah no [ __ ]

2835.59 --> 2839.58
rude earth of course Nathan is not

2837.69 --> 2840.09
getting involved it's like woody why

2839.58 --> 2842.64
woody

2840.09 --> 2846.36
what good is it good as it had to him

2842.64 --> 2849.66
it's only a huge distraction for the

2846.36 --> 2852.15
Flat Earth and the the learning school

2849.66 --> 2854.37
that Nathan's platform really is about

2852.15 --> 2856.7400000000002
the technicals and now this is only

2854.37 --> 2858.98
gonna spur more distraction for

2856.74 --> 2862.5
infighting so of course he's avoiding it

2858.98 --> 2864.2400000000002
because Nathan is kind of crushing it if

2862.5 --> 2870.53
you might have taken notice Nathan is

2864.24 --> 2874.02
crushing it in recent times it's like

2870.53 --> 2878.13
just becoming better at at the teardown

2874.02 --> 2880.05
that he does making it better and making

2878.13 --> 2881.01
it funnier and just the timing is just

2880.05 --> 2884.2200000000003
getting better

2881.01 --> 2887.7900000000004
okay so compliments to that Nathan but

2884.22 --> 2891.7799999999997
you got to be careful not to like shoot

2887.79 --> 2897.57
off too quickly or your roots might get

2891.78 --> 2900.15
overburdened by that but yeah I do

2897.57 --> 2903.27
address things here I just try to be

2900.15 --> 2905.4900000000002
very careful with how I do it so I don't

2903.27 --> 2909.36
pile on too much into something and

2905.49 --> 2911.49
create more people just echoing on some

2909.36 --> 2914.52
kind of infighting situation I try to

2911.49 --> 2917.1299999999997
avoid that you know there's already

2914.52 --> 2921.3
enough nuisance now because of the

2917.13 --> 2924.15
division concerning 5g and what are the

2921.3 --> 2927.75
implications of Radiologic s-- all that

2924.15 --> 2930.06
that's already annoying enough like

2927.75 --> 2930.67
annoying enough for me to not bring it

2930.06 --> 2939.099
up anymore

2930.67 --> 2943.48
at all and yeah people know my stance

2939.099 --> 2946.329
about it they yeah I've shared how I

2943.48 --> 2948.73
came to my conclusions and if people

2946.329 --> 2951.059
don't want to hear about that or think

2948.73 --> 2954.4900000000002
that I'm just delusional

2951.059 --> 2958.8390000000004
yeah that's there's nothing I can do

2954.49 --> 2961.029
about that it's up to them I'm gonna be

2958.839 --> 2963.279
freaking careful with that stuff I have

2961.029 --> 2967.799
been for a long time because I can

2963.279 --> 2967.799
freaking feel it in a way I'm even

2968.13 --> 2974.17
slightly conflicted about having a

2971.319 --> 2976.359
freakin wireless phone it's just a style

2974.17 --> 2981.609
even if it's a basic one in my room

2976.359 --> 2983.859
where I sleep I don't like that if I'd

2981.609 --> 2986.019
have a bigger house I wouldn't do that I

2983.859 --> 2992.2889999999998
would use another type of alarm clock

2986.019 --> 2994.1499999999996
and I will keep it away from my bed but

2992.289 --> 2999.5490000000004
I don't have any other place to store my

2994.15 --> 3002.279
phone that makes sense so yeah that's

2999.549 --> 3004.38
just the way it is right now but yeah

3002.279 --> 3007.529
I'm that meticulous with that because

3004.38 --> 3009.7200000000003
it's real and really is and not

3007.529 --> 3013.65
everybody will be affected by this sort

3009.72 --> 3018.39
of thing to that degree I do so I do

3013.65 --> 3021.119
this purely out of self-defense I do it

3018.39 --> 3023.6299999999997
to survive because it poses a real

3021.119 --> 3027.599
danger to me physically and

3023.63 --> 3029.9100000000003
psychologically but physically first and

3027.599 --> 3033.21
foremost if it was just psychological I

3029.91 --> 3035.22
tried to basically say no I'm literally

3033.21 --> 3036.75
gonna switch it around say no okay I'm

3035.22 --> 3039.1189999999997
not gonna believe it anymore I'm just

3036.75 --> 3041.009
gonna completely ignore the idea of

3039.119 --> 3043.65
Radiologic it's the visible it doesn't

3041.009 --> 3046.91
exist my body can take it or whatever

3043.65 --> 3049.049
and then go about I did that in

3046.91 --> 3051.93
situations where it was kind of like out

3049.049 --> 3057.66
of my control and guess what in the

3051.93 --> 3061.5789999999997
evening I feel yeah it feels there is a

3057.66 --> 3061.5789999999997
difference there's a big difference

3062.28 --> 3072.73
it it doesn't just go away if I

3065.86 --> 3074.8
disbelieve it so yeah yeah the

3072.73 --> 3076.45
old-fashioned phones yes I know what you

3074.8 --> 3078.21
mean the snark it's like the the late

3076.45 --> 3080.95
90s phones

3078.21 --> 3084.67
my mother was completely addicted to

3080.95 --> 3087.1
that and they are very they were

3084.67 --> 3093.4300000000003
dangerous potentially people didn't

3087.1 --> 3096.4
understand now this phone is not really

3093.43 --> 3100.45
like that it is a basic one I don't even

3096.4 --> 3106.9900000000002
have internet on and it's just a very

3100.45 --> 3109.5
basic phone and when I talk to people

3106.99 --> 3112.39
over the phone like my friends yesterday

3109.5 --> 3115.93
three-and-a-half hours right I keep it

3112.39 --> 3117.7
at a distance I technically shouldn't

3115.93 --> 3119.7999999999997
even hold it in my hands because then my

3117.7 --> 3122.35
blood is going to be affected for three

3119.8 --> 3126.9
hours now I switch them but always keep

3122.35 --> 3126.9
it an arm's length away from me always I

3128.49 --> 3135.31
could technically also just put it down

3131.29 --> 3137.5
and then go about like that but that can

3135.31 --> 3139.86
tends to get me very distracted when I

3137.5 --> 3139.86
do that

3146.84 --> 3149.6200000000003
what

3150.51 --> 3155.1800000000003
I have no idea what you're talking about

3152.49 --> 3155.18
rude everything

3181.24 --> 3188.4199999999996
uh no Jack six five three six five three

3185.48 --> 3196.3
that's absolutely not true now Riley is

3188.42 --> 3196.3
not distorting things that's not true

3196.33 --> 3204.17
they have a bigger picture to this okay

3199.16 --> 3209.87
they they have the the videos they got

3204.17 --> 3212.4500000000003
it they were there and it is principles

3209.87 --> 3214.25
and Tony is very tenacious with that

3212.45 --> 3221.4199999999996
sort of thing he doesn't let go and he

3214.25 --> 3223.64
shouldn't it's part of his Skerritt so

3221.42 --> 3226.9900000000002
now don't uh don't downplay the

3223.64 --> 3232.94
situation there is it is what it is

3226.99 --> 3235.45
don't be a baller about it no don't

3232.94 --> 3242.09
start to make up excuses for things that

3235.45 --> 3244.0099999999998
that well it doesn't necessarily

3242.09 --> 3249.08
influence you but yeah it's just

3244.01 --> 3251.36
something you should keep in mind don't

3249.08 --> 3253.45
start out making excuses for that sort

3251.36 --> 3253.4500000000003
of thing

3270.93 --> 3277.859
what yeah rude Arthur please don't go

3275.309 --> 3281.9300000000003
with the caps and I have no idea what

3277.859 --> 3281.93
you're talking about man I have no idea

3297.13 --> 3305.4700000000003
well Jack I think it had to do with the

3300.849 --> 3307.2400000000002
rent mostly don't know where of where

3305.47 --> 3310.049
you're getting this redecorating of

3307.24 --> 3310.049
kitchens from

3343.07 --> 3356.96
right flat ball that's correct because

3348.31 --> 3360.5299999999997
yeah these people these what is this are

3356.96 --> 3363.89
they like cultists now does ranty have a

3360.53 --> 3366.44
cult sorry sorry to subtly initiate a

3363.89 --> 3370.8199999999997
new conspiracy theory but it's just it

3366.44 --> 3372.44
seems like he has these defenders now to

3370.82 --> 3376.4
be fair I got a couple of them myself

3372.44 --> 3379.19
but hey they follow principles I'd even

3376.4 --> 3381.46
be inclined sometimes to say look guys

3379.19 --> 3384.11
to tone it down a little you know don't

3381.46 --> 3388.55
don't put me on like this high mighty

3384.11 --> 3390.92
pedestal please you know I try not to do

3388.55 --> 3394.8100000000004
that you shouldn't either really but

3390.92 --> 3399.4700000000003
just use the spirit of it use the energy

3394.81 --> 3402.71
what okay

3399.47 --> 3405.3399999999997
your spelling is off and this is

3402.71 --> 3405.34
ridiculous

3410.92 --> 3420.17
but like why defend this situation you

3415.16 --> 3421.94
know like why just let it be what you

3420.17 --> 3424.64
think that going out and saying no it's

3421.94 --> 3427.31
all lies and no you're all shitty you

3424.64 --> 3436.24
think that's gonna help the situation

3427.31 --> 3439.6
get better you know what the [ __ ] Larry

3436.24 --> 3439.6
what's going on

3446.41 --> 3457.69
what did I say what I'm just talking

3452.95 --> 3460.6
about people that defending really weird

3457.69 --> 3462.04
things you know it's like isn't that

3460.6 --> 3466.33
like cultish in a way I'm not saying

3462.04 --> 3467.77
like oh there is a cult literally just

3466.33 --> 3474.52
calm it down man

3467.77 --> 3476.11
I even literally fed it back to my own

3474.52 --> 3481.08
followers okay

3476.11 --> 3481.08
so cool it off man sheesh

3492.04 --> 3502.23
this is yeah yeah we're inviting L&B

3499.48 --> 3502.23
sorry

3512.83 --> 3516.93
Allen B could be Sam what

3531.81 --> 3536.12
what is up with Cleary all of a sudden

3548.89 --> 3553.6189999999997
yes I know Jim Jones I know what you

3551.109 --> 3553.619
mean with them

3567.14 --> 3574.009
yeah that's right on the money

3571.069 --> 3576.079
Guns of Navarone rmp all the Niners put

3574.009 --> 3578.45
on your smart minds and watch that hang

3576.079 --> 3579.829
out slowly dissecting it that's the only

3578.45 --> 3582.98
way you will see the truth that's right

3579.829 --> 3588.44
and that's why I don't get why yeah

3582.98 --> 3590.63
people like ruder Thor and Jack like why

3588.44 --> 3596.7490000000003
they're acting like that it's like why

3590.63 --> 3599.9300000000003
are you defending something like that or

3596.749 --> 3604.2099999999996
denying it when this is pretty plain

3599.93 --> 3604.21
obvious really if you watch the videos

3610.1 --> 3616.8199999999997
trait the grantee and tricked or Hylian

3613.55 --> 3620.9300000000003
too much for the what oh right so you're

3616.82 --> 3622.7000000000003
I get it yeah yeah that's something else

3620.93 --> 3625.54
I heard it's kind of weird I don't know

3622.7 --> 3627.95
man I really don't know anymore

3625.54 --> 3630.92
I'm not gonna get too involved with that

3627.95 --> 3632.45
what I am keeping my eye out really I am

3630.92 --> 3638.0
I'm gonna run out to show soon by the

3632.45 --> 3640.8399999999997
way but yeah I've heard that maybe there

3638.0 --> 3644.06
is something weird going on with Samhain

3640.84 --> 3646.07
that he might be playing a game with

3644.06 --> 3651.41
people but it's there is no way to

3646.07 --> 3653.3900000000003
confirm it for me so I'm not that look

3651.41 --> 3655.79
this good it's just like you yeah things

3653.39 --> 3658.46
are getting nutty and all I know about

3655.79 --> 3660.71
Randy is everything that I know he's

3658.46 --> 3668.03
done what we've talked about what do you

3660.71 --> 3669.65
so that's where I take my estimations

3668.03 --> 3672.26
from as to what is happening in the

3669.65 --> 3676.1600000000003
situation because Randy does kind of

3672.26 --> 3681.7700000000004
like to play with people but I don't

3676.16 --> 3684.35
know if he's literally done exactly the

3681.77 --> 3686.66
way things happen like I said because

3684.35 --> 3688.94
might be that Samhain is playing a game

3686.66 --> 3691.72
I don't know I'm not gonna lay down any

3688.94 --> 3697.67
accusations like that it's just getting

3691.72 --> 3703.45
complicated and I hope that Riley will

3697.67 --> 3703.4500000000003
figure it out with some help of others

3707.74 --> 3714.8799999999997
right so yeah I hope I didn't trigger

3711.22 --> 3715.8999999999996
too many people and yeah if I did that

3714.88 --> 3719.1400000000003
screw that

3715.9 --> 3722.23
see I'm just trying to speak my mind and

3719.14 --> 3726.0699999999997
speak the truth and not like more fires

3722.23 --> 3729.28

3726.07 --> 3731.04
