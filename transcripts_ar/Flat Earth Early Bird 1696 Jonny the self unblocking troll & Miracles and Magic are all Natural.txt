so yeah keep it going great sorry for

74.88 --> 79.32
starting so late I did say yesterday

76.86 --> 81.18
that was probably gonna happen

79.32 --> 84.72
since well

81.18 --> 87.299
I had to do some grocery shopping

84.72 --> 89.28
look at this weather though

87.299 --> 90.60000000000001
it was quite a pleasure going out doing

89.28 --> 92.52
that

90.6 --> 93.78
because the weather is absolutely

92.52 --> 97.079
gorgeous

93.78 --> 99.72
super pristine Blue Skies

97.079 --> 102.6
the only downside is there's like that

99.72 --> 106.439
it could have a little bit more wind

102.6 --> 110.03999999999999
it is really hot with this

106.439 --> 112.74
bright Sun around

110.04 --> 116.24000000000001
plants are holding holding up because

112.74 --> 116.24
they give them a lot of water now

116.479 --> 121.03999999999999
so with the same with the birds

129.36 --> 131.899
right

133.14 --> 135.73899999999998
anyway

135.84 --> 141.5
oh

137.16 --> 141.5
look it's Mr Burns

143.64 --> 148.26
and he's immediately got a timeout what

145.5 --> 150.9
do you say delusional dude oh oh yeah

148.26 --> 153.72
yeah yeah he's just a dumbass right

150.9 --> 155.52
anyway hello LSG first in chat Richard G

153.72 --> 161.519
good to see you

155.52 --> 163.31900000000002
it is Monday the 21st of August 2023

161.519 --> 164.81900000000002
and I am starting late so it's going to

163.319 --> 167.54
be yeah it's not going to be a four hour

164.819 --> 167.54
show today

168.599 --> 175.94
it's going to be an hour and 50 minute

173.58 --> 175.94000000000003
show

177.78 --> 182.819
all right don't have to have a four hour

180.48 --> 184.01899999999998
show every day

182.819 --> 185.599
right

184.019 --> 188.58
so yeah

185.599 --> 190.92
I don't have tea I thought like yeah I'm

188.58 --> 195.36
not gonna do that with this heat just no

190.92 --> 198.35999999999999
point do have an Illuminati Castle

195.36 --> 200.04000000000002
looking forward to did not eat all that

198.36 --> 201.78
much yesterday

200.04 --> 204.959
and a gusto

201.78 --> 207.44
which is very appropriate for this heat

204.959 --> 207.44
right

210.72 --> 215.7
let's check the temperature

212.7 --> 218.28
it is probably like 20

215.7 --> 220.85999999999999
7 or 28.

218.28 --> 224.4
[Music]

220.86 --> 226.56
but it's still my 26 okay fair enough

224.4 --> 228.86
it's a lack of wind that's really doing

226.56 --> 228.86
it

231.36 --> 236.34
tomorrow is going to be an all sunny day

234.0 --> 239.64
according to these predictions

236.34 --> 243.08
without any sort of clouds

239.64 --> 243.07999999999998
still 26 degrees

245.459 --> 248.06
right

249.299 --> 255.14000000000001
anyway how are you guys doing

251.819 --> 255.14
had a bit of a late night

257.519 --> 262.56
white cat keeping me up again although

259.44 --> 263.699
she basically ended up like sleeping on

262.56 --> 265.8
my bed

263.699 --> 268.56
where I was sleeping like I've never had

265.8 --> 270.90000000000003
that happen before

268.56 --> 273.72
uh

270.9 --> 278.17999999999995
right the last roommate came back from

273.72 --> 278.18
vacation apparently he went to Mexico

281.28 --> 286.32
yeah I got the paypals in so I was able

283.259 --> 287.88
to stock up on everything I got food and

286.32 --> 290.54
smokes and

287.88 --> 290.54
I got everything

291.0 --> 296.419
Gusto got that because I didn't have

293.58 --> 296.419
that anymore either

296.639 --> 300.74
hello Amanda Jung good to see you

309.54 --> 313.759
right so yeah busy day yesterday

314.58 --> 318.53999999999996
can't believe like how long that show

316.62 --> 321.36
lasted I was like con continually

318.54 --> 326.16
looking at the clock and it's like

321.36 --> 327.96000000000004
what no way no way it's past six what

326.16 --> 330.12
yeah but that's what happens when you

327.96 --> 333.65999999999997
have a four hour show

330.12 --> 333.66
right uh

333.96 --> 337.56
see what else did I do yeah there was of

335.88 --> 341.039
course uh

337.56 --> 343.02
QE had another live treatment

341.039 --> 345.479
but it was very late I don't think I

343.02 --> 347.28
watched I watch all of it I don't

345.479 --> 350.12
remember

347.28 --> 350.11999999999995
uh

354.24 --> 356.72
right

361.199 --> 364.199
s

372.66 --> 376.34000000000003
so yeah it is hot

378.0 --> 384.9
the sun is still hitting my wall here so

382.28 --> 388.28
basically getting a bit cooked

384.9 --> 388.28
so what are you guys up to

389.22 --> 391.94000000000005
anything else

402.38 --> 409.8
right so I I probably don't need to

407.22 --> 412.319
give you this news flash because if you

409.8 --> 414.419
guys in my chat typically haven't got

412.319 --> 417.0
caught on this yet

414.419 --> 420.24
it's like where have you been but yeah

417.0 --> 421.56
apparently there's gonna be a new World

420.24 --> 424.8
Order

421.56 --> 427.199
Corona lockdown this September halfway

424.8 --> 431.28000000000003
September so where they're gonna try

427.199 --> 435.12
that so probably have to I really hope

431.28 --> 437.15999999999997
it doesn't hit home here

435.12 --> 438.96
because then I probably have to wear a

437.16 --> 440.819
stupid mask again in the coffee shop

438.96 --> 444.419
which is like the only place where they

440.819 --> 446.28000000000003
actually force that the last time

444.419 --> 449.099
because in the supermarket I'm not doing

446.28 --> 450.96
it I got a card I show the card I'm not

449.099 --> 453.12
doing it

450.96 --> 456.78
and I still got the card and I'm gonna

453.12 --> 459.979
show the card again so yeah

456.78 --> 459.979
they're gonna try it

460.68 --> 465.319
be prepared it's basically the same

463.139 --> 467.94
system same rules

465.319 --> 470.52000000000004
safe to say I don't need to tell you

467.94 --> 474.06
guys not to participate in any kind of

470.52 --> 475.979
experiment experimental vaccines

474.06 --> 478.02
right well maybe they're not

475.979 --> 480.0
experimental anymore they they turned

478.02 --> 481.919
out to work

480.0 --> 484.139
for the purpose that they were created

481.919 --> 488.479
for

484.139 --> 488.479
which is not what they say of course

489.419 --> 493.56
uh

491.58 --> 495.96
yeah but don't take any tests either

493.56 --> 500.099
they're they're proven to be useless

495.96 --> 504.18
by the very designer of them

500.099 --> 506.52
uh just don't participate with anything

504.18 --> 508.86
and

506.52 --> 512.399
if it's like a boss that's gonna like

508.86 --> 514.919
threaten to fire you well then

512.399 --> 518.959
be aware of like what is the company

514.919 --> 521.459
structure like where is he at because

518.959 --> 522.419
businesses out there are not doing super

521.459 --> 525.779
great

522.419 --> 529.0799999999999
and for them to just fire you over that

525.779 --> 532.86
well that could make it all collapse so

529.08 --> 534.36
a strategy I if I had a job and I was

532.86 --> 535.86
threatened like oh you're going to wear

534.36 --> 538.6800000000001
a mask and you got to do this and that

535.86 --> 541.14
or you're fired I would

538.68 --> 543.959
well first off decide like okay I'll be

541.14 --> 546.24
fired then but maybe you can hold it off

543.959 --> 549.8599999999999
by basically telling like yeah uh know

546.24 --> 549.86
what everybody knows this is fake

550.14 --> 555.0
and your business is literally going to

553.5 --> 558.48
go bust

555.0 --> 562.08
if you continue this so I suggest

558.48 --> 564.72
you let me do my job

562.08 --> 567.48
and we all just pretend like nothing

564.72 --> 570.5400000000001
happened which it hasn't because nothing

567.48 --> 574.2
has actually happened

570.54 --> 577.38
and I don't want you to lose your

574.2 --> 578.88
business either boss right that would be

577.38 --> 580.98
my tactic

578.88 --> 584.7
and other than that yeah I can't really

580.98 --> 586.44
help you out any more than that

584.7 --> 589.019
I don't know what's up what else we

586.44 --> 592.3800000000001
could do except for just absolutely no

589.019 --> 594.6
no part I mean participating in this

592.38 --> 597.36
even if it's out of fair or whatever

594.6 --> 599.519
like that's treason it's treason Against

597.36 --> 600.6
Humanity to operate with this that's how

599.519 --> 604.019
I see it

600.6 --> 604.86
you comply you're a traitor to your

604.019 --> 607.44
people

604.86 --> 610.32
that's how I see it

607.44 --> 612.5400000000001
you could consider saying it like that

610.32 --> 615.24
as well to your colleagues if you feel

612.54 --> 618.18
that that safe

615.24 --> 620.4590000000001
but I definitely do see it like that

618.18 --> 623.04
yeah comply

620.459 --> 624.3
with any of the lockdown mask wearing

623.04 --> 626.8199999999999
vaccine whatever they're going to roll

624.3 --> 629.16
out tests you're a traitor to your

626.82 --> 631.6800000000001
people if you comply

629.16 --> 634.3199999999999
yeah even if all but I want to see

631.68 --> 636.3599999999999
Grandma or oh I want to keep my yeah

634.32 --> 638.82
yeah it doesn't matter

636.36 --> 640.44
if you comply you're a Trader you're a

638.82 --> 642.9200000000001
Trader to your people

640.44 --> 647.1600000000001
yeah in this case it's more important

642.92 --> 650.16
unless you're like perfectly okay with

647.16 --> 654.6
the prospect of another

650.16 --> 659.48
10 extra deaths

654.6 --> 659.48
from suddenly and unexpected yeah

659.64 --> 663.24
if you're okay with that well then

661.32 --> 666.12
you're a psychopath

663.24 --> 667.86
and you're a traitor to humanity so it

666.12 --> 670.8
doesn't really matter how you twist or

667.86 --> 673.26
turn it do not comply or you're a

670.8 --> 675.3
traitor to your people

673.26 --> 678.68
it's that simple

675.3 --> 678.68
so that's the news flash

686.1 --> 692.339
yeah Richard G I know it's rolling out

688.8 --> 694.14
Alex has been very upfront with warning

692.339 --> 696.0
it I mean yeah he's talking a lot of he

694.14 --> 697.92
talks a lot of

696.0 --> 699.54
or [ __ ]

697.92 --> 701.3389999999999
[ __ ] and oh we're going through the

699.54 --> 703.26
stars and have to show the space

701.339 --> 705.48
launches in every [ __ ] intro yeah

703.26 --> 708.0
yeah we know but he does give us early

705.48 --> 711.72
warnings about specifics like these

708.0 --> 713.94
because it's basically people

711.72 --> 717.019
hearing that and immediately like

713.94 --> 717.019
leaking it

717.6 --> 724.019
through well yeah

720.12 --> 726.0
through contact so that is useful and

724.019 --> 729.12
this is coming they're gonna try it but

726.0 --> 732.06
we're all prepared now right I mean we

729.12 --> 733.98
were all prepared three years ago like I

732.06 --> 736.7399999999999
was literally saying don't do this don't

733.98 --> 740.54
do that this is gonna happen and it all

736.74 --> 742.8
[ __ ] happened exactly like I said

740.54 --> 745.3389999999999
exactly like I said

742.8 --> 745.3389999999999
yeah

745.62 --> 750.3
I mean the five years haven't fully

748.86 --> 753.66
passed yet

750.3 --> 755.6999999999999
but we're already well underway

753.66 --> 758.1
yeah you can already see that

755.7 --> 759.24
everybody's take that's taking it is all

758.1 --> 762.0790000000001
[ __ ]

759.24 --> 762.0790000000001
most of them

763.2 --> 770.339
and once there were some lucky of course

766.44 --> 774.5400000000001
but I'm not even too sure about that

770.339 --> 776.22
like the oh might have a saline maybe or

774.54 --> 780.24
maybe the stuff that they put in there

776.22 --> 781.6800000000001
is simply gonna take longer before it

780.24 --> 784.6800000000001
reveals itself

781.68 --> 787.4399999999999
a longer delay time for the triggering

784.68 --> 789.5999999999999
effects so of a different nature

787.44 --> 792.36
not the typical

789.6 --> 794.519
weird rubbery [ __ ] that starts to form

792.36 --> 796.86
in your veins kind of thing

794.519 --> 799.8
right because

796.86 --> 801.3000000000001
that's not the only thing yeah I said it

799.8 --> 803.88
even back then

801.3 --> 807.3
yeah there was no ingredient list to the

803.88 --> 811.26
vaccines and I said

807.3 --> 815.459
it's gonna take decades to figure out

811.26 --> 818.1
what the [ __ ] they all put in there

815.459 --> 821.2199999999999
because it's so many different things

818.1 --> 825.899
expert it's like they had experiments

821.22 --> 828.9590000000001
like a lineup for like three decades

825.899 --> 830.639
and they put it all in this

828.959 --> 832.6199999999999
this and that this and that this and

830.639 --> 834.899
that this and that all the and so we

832.62 --> 837.36
don't [ __ ] know we haven't seen the

834.899 --> 841.94
last of it still right it's all coming

837.36 --> 841.94
through exactly like I said it would

843.56 --> 849.1199999999999
[Music]

845.399 --> 850.98
and uh yeah so we all know this

849.12 --> 853.5600000000001
they're gonna try to roll it out again

850.98 --> 854.88
and they're gonna try it exactly in the

853.56 --> 857.88
same way

854.88 --> 860.42
so if you fall for it now

857.88 --> 860.42
like

860.579 --> 863.12
yeah

864.839 --> 869.5790000000001
you're either too stupid to live or

867.24 --> 872.22
you're a traited to humanity

869.579 --> 876.18
either way yeah it's I don't expect

872.22 --> 878.22
anybody here to actually even remotely

876.18 --> 879.959
consider it so I'm kind of preaching to

878.22 --> 882.5400000000001
the choir here

879.959 --> 883.9799999999999
anyway

882.54 --> 886.76
hey dank

883.98 --> 886.76
Johnny

1318.919 --> 1322.0590000000002
I'm not sure

1463.22 --> 1468.5
more new to this

[Music]

1474.919 --> 1480.5590000000002

drink some Red Bull

1518.84 --> 1525.039
wear three masks yeah yeah

1521.059 --> 1525.039
glue them on your face if you can

1527.31 --> 1533.74
[Music]

1531.2 --> 1536.8400000000001
add fluoride

1533.74 --> 1538.159
nah now don't do that I mean where the

1536.84 --> 1540.62
hell are you even gonna get pure

1538.159 --> 1543.98
fluoride it's just that's

1540.62 --> 1545.9599999999998
very dangerous like fluorides you you're

1543.98 --> 1548.0
not actually allowed to have fluoride

1545.96 --> 1549.6200000000001
you know

1548.0 --> 1552.559
didn't you know that

1549.62 --> 1553.8799999999999
like it's technically you can't just own

1552.559 --> 1557.8999999999999
fluoride

1553.88 --> 1560.3600000000001
because it's a hazardous waste material

1557.9 --> 1562.5800000000002
you're not allowed to just own that you

1560.36 --> 1565.24
see so you're not gonna just get some

1562.58 --> 1567.6789999999999
fluoride and put it in your water that's

1565.24 --> 1571.24
not gonna happen

1567.679 --> 1574.1000000000001
right but you can buy like

1571.24 --> 1576.74
fluoridated water for toddlers in the

1574.1 --> 1579.02
supermarket you could use that it's

1576.74 --> 1580.46
extra fluoridated right that's a good

1579.02 --> 1582.74
way to get

1580.46 --> 1585.6200000000001
that Hazard material that you're not

1582.74 --> 1589.94
technically allowed to to own because

1585.62 --> 1591.9189999999999
it's dangerous and highly toxic

1589.94 --> 1596.24
yeah as a citizen you're not allowed to

1591.919 --> 1598.64
own a bag of pure sodium fluoride

1596.24 --> 1602.24
or hydrofluorocilicic acid you're not

1598.64 --> 1604.88
allowed to own that because it's like

1602.24 --> 1606.86
dangerous material that to the

1604.88 --> 1608.2990000000002
government there's like almost like well

1606.86 --> 1611.6
it's not

1608.299 --> 1614.12
now what do you even compare it to

1611.6 --> 1618.26
it's like having

1614.12 --> 1620.12
tankers of dioxide dioxy right very

1618.26 --> 1622.64
hazardous material very dangerous if

1620.12 --> 1624.9799999999998
that escapes it's like things die and

1622.64 --> 1627.38
get super poisoned yeah that's why the

1624.98 --> 1629.299
government doesn't allow you to just own

1627.38 --> 1632.2990000000002
that as a citizen you have to have

1629.299 --> 1635.12
special permissions and safeguards and

1632.299 --> 1637.279
money yeah so you're not allowed to own

1635.12 --> 1639.3999999999999
fluoride either because it's a hazardous

1637.279 --> 1643.34
waste material

1639.4 --> 1645.74
they will still sell bottles of water

1643.34 --> 1646.8799999999999
with it in in there though for you to

1645.74 --> 1649.58
drink

1646.88 --> 1651.74
but that's the only way you're legally

1649.58 --> 1652.76
allowed as a citizen to have sodium

1651.74 --> 1655.58
fluoride

1652.76 --> 1657.26
is in your consumption product you see

1655.58 --> 1659.1399999999999
yes you can't actually have the raw

1657.26 --> 1663.1
material because it's super dangerous

1659.14 --> 1663.1000000000001
you can only eat it

1665.559 --> 1671.24
so ignore

1668.24 --> 1674.9
suck just delete them don't address him

1671.24 --> 1677.299
don't talk about him just delete him and

1674.9 --> 1678.14
he's not there right he's not gonna show

1677.299 --> 1681.1399999999999
up

1678.14 --> 1683.0590000000002
in the replays nobody needs to know that

1681.14 --> 1684.74
he exists

1683.059 --> 1686.84
and besides

1684.74 --> 1689.1200000000001
if he does what he's actually saying

1686.84 --> 1691.1
he's doing he's not gonna exist for much

1689.12 --> 1693.82
longer anyway

1691.1 --> 1693.82
right

1696.2 --> 1699.4

I thought you kind of were a troll but I

1718.1 --> 1720.9399999999998
might be mistaken

1722.36 --> 1728.059
I can't directly see any trollishness to

1725.84 --> 1729.74
your comments so I might just be

1728.059 --> 1732.26
mistaken

1729.74 --> 1733.88
or there's another guy that has wolf in

1732.26 --> 1735.3799999999999
their name that's like acting like a

1733.88 --> 1737.74
real troll out there it might have mixed

1735.38 --> 1737.74
you up

1741.98 --> 1747.94
I'm not sure anyway

1744.98 --> 1747.94

1797.299 --> 1801.3799999999999
person to do that

1798.98 --> 1804.82
Johnny [ __ ]

1801.38 --> 1804.8200000000002

1818.179 --> 1822.88
you're not gonna impress me anyway

1824.179 --> 1830.3600000000001
you're gonna impress me is if you manage

1826.94 --> 1834.0800000000002
to top the level of retardation

1830.36 --> 1835.52
showed by other anti-flat earther and

1834.08 --> 1838.22
people that

1835.52 --> 1840.679
like trolls because that's a very hard

1838.22 --> 1844.159
accomplishment at this point I mean

1840.679 --> 1847.8400000000001
the yeah the championship is pretty much

1844.159 --> 1847.8400000000001
held by Jaron at this point

1848.419 --> 1854.98
he is the number one idiot and you're

1851.419 --> 1854.98
not really gonna surpass that

1856.399 --> 1861.4599999999998
you maybe if you take more boosters

1858.74 --> 1861.46
maybe then

1863.779 --> 1869.32
you are a Glover as you would oh oh dear

1866.36 --> 1869.32

[Music]

1948.799 --> 1954.62
all right yeah Johnny this is very cool

1951.799 --> 1957.26
that whatever you're able to do that's

1954.62 --> 1959.4189999999999
cool I just reported you

1957.26 --> 1961.399
so whatever you're doing supposedly

1959.419 --> 1963.98
[ __ ] with the system to unban

1961.399 --> 1968.299
yourself or whatever that is that's cool

1963.98 --> 1970.88
YouTube's gonna delete your account too

1968.299 --> 1975.1589999999999
but you're probably

1970.88 --> 1975.159
using illegal functions anyway

1975.559 --> 1978.559
foreign

2010.02 --> 2013.1399999999999
[Music]

2021.179 --> 2026.7
leave it leave Johnny I'm gonna just

2023.62 --> 2026.6999999999998
report him straight out

2032.919 --> 2035.5800000000002
there you go

2040.659 --> 2045.7
ah

2042.64 --> 2047.8200000000002
I think he was I didn't do that I think

2045.7 --> 2050.5
he just literally

2047.82 --> 2052.24
disappeared I think the report finally

2050.5 --> 2054.52
came through

2052.24 --> 2056.4399999999996
so no more Johnny I think his account

2054.52 --> 2059.379
has now actually been deleted by YouTube

2056.44 --> 2062.26
all I had to do was write report spam

2059.379 --> 2063.639
and bullying which is what literally is

2062.26 --> 2066.76
going on

2063.639 --> 2068.98
and now he's gone oh you you stupid

2066.76 --> 2070.48
little trick didn't work anymore not

2068.98 --> 2073.419
[ __ ]

2070.48 --> 2076.389
keep taking those boosters [ __ ] face

2073.419 --> 2079.629
ah

2076.389 --> 2079.629
[Music]

2085.54 --> 2090.159
companies

2087.099 --> 2093.0
to sell pure sodium chloride online what

2090.159 --> 2093.0
are you for real

2095.74 --> 2100.839
Jesus

2097.9 --> 2104.5
okay well I guess that you can just buy

2100.839 --> 2107.38
pure poison then in the US

2104.5 --> 2111.339
you can't do that here though

2107.38 --> 2114.339
it's really messed up I didn't know that

2111.339 --> 2118.359
but it's America so why not

2114.339 --> 2120.5789999999997
right I mean ooh you're selling raw milk

2118.359 --> 2122.0789999999997
well then you're gonna be shot down for

2120.579 --> 2124.119
sure

2122.079 --> 2125.7400000000002
but you of course you can just buy

2124.119 --> 2127.42
sodium fluoride

2125.74 --> 2130.4399999999996
online

2127.42 --> 2130.44
that makes sense

2132.64 --> 2137.7
yeah

2134.079 --> 2137.7000000000003
what is going on with this [ __ ]

2165.04 --> 2170.44
sets a huge flag on you you're guessing

2168.339 --> 2173.68
right well that's just the same thing as

2170.44 --> 2176.8
if you would buy a lot of like chemical

2173.68 --> 2178.7799999999997
iodine right because of the potential

2176.8 --> 2183.46
[ __ ] that you can make with that like

2178.78 --> 2186.1600000000003
drugs and explosives and so yeah

2183.46 --> 2188.38
they would probably flag you but I mean

2186.16 --> 2190.96
you can still buy it that's crazy you

2188.38 --> 2192.2200000000003
can't buy that [ __ ] that [ __ ] is illegal

2190.96 --> 2194.32
here

2192.22 --> 2195.8799999999997
you can still get it in toothpaste I

2194.32 --> 2198.04
think but you're not allowed to actually

2195.88 --> 2201.2200000000003
have it it's just been environmentally

2198.04 --> 2204.66
completely banned because it's super

2201.22 --> 2204.66
hazardous for the environment

2205.9 --> 2212.44
which is great I mean yeah hooray actual

2209.92 --> 2214.839
environmentalism that's right ban the

2212.44 --> 2217.2400000000002
actual poisons that's right

2214.839 --> 2218.44
excellent

2217.24 --> 2220.2
yeah

2218.44 --> 2223.119
don't ban

2220.2 --> 2225.04
components that are essential for life

2223.119 --> 2228.52
to even exist

2225.04 --> 2231.839
but definitely ban the real hazardous

[Music]

2334.839 --> 2341.969
you know what I'm wondering

2338.93 --> 2341.969
[Music]

2342.099 --> 2346.54
if somebody's saying like oh I'm gonna

2344.44 --> 2350.7400000000002
take the boosters

2346.54 --> 2353.52
could you technically report them

2350.74 --> 2353.52
for

2354.16 --> 2357.8999999999996
suicide or self-injury

2358.66 --> 2363.5789999999997
I mean YouTube's probably not going to

2361.18 --> 2367.96
recognize it but technically that would

2363.579 --> 2370.119
be actually correct right

2367.96 --> 2374.14
oh Johnny didn't go back to work either

2370.119 --> 2377.82
I don't think Johnny has any work

2374.14 --> 2377.8199999999997
or this is Johnny's work

2378.28 --> 2384.52
you have no Talent then I

2381.64 --> 2386.68
but he has The Talented to [ __ ] around

2384.52 --> 2387.64
with computers and and waste people's

2386.68 --> 2390.04
time

2387.64 --> 2393.16
and be a scummy [ __ ]

2390.04 --> 2395.92
would never ever face any person face to

2393.16 --> 2397.48
face ever

2395.92 --> 2400.96
because then it turned out to be a

2397.48 --> 2404.02
sniveling feeble little Grappler

2400.96 --> 2407.619

commercial contact spam

2649.98 --> 2655.78
harassment bullying

2652.72 --> 2658.72
those two are probably the best options

2655.78 --> 2661.8590000000004
just keep doing it eventually YouTube is

2658.72 --> 2661.859
gonna have to do something

2666.3 --> 2671.8
[Music]

2669.88 --> 2673.599
you can block this

2671.8 --> 2675.88
can just block this Johnny you know

2673.599 --> 2678.599
really does that work

2675.88 --> 2678.599
hmm

2678.94 --> 2683.94
it's not even an option in the list

2688.54 --> 2693.04
I don't know

2689.859 --> 2695.7999999999997
it doesn't see it doesn't show any

2693.04 --> 2697.839
option to block a Como virus I don't

2695.8 --> 2700.7400000000002

2715.54 --> 2718.44

2736.24 --> 2741.22
poons I can't block him I don't know why

2738.579 --> 2743.8

3060.119 --> 3065.1800000000003
I'm just gonna report his direct Channel

3088.52 --> 3093.3
[Applause]

3090.25 --> 3096.409
[Music]

3093.3 --> 3096.409
[Applause]

3102.94 --> 3106.289
[Applause]

3118.319 --> 3123.3
I can find a legal complaint oh

3124.46 --> 3128.3
oh that's nice

3132.24 --> 3138.72
yeah yeah that's a that's a good one

3136.38 --> 3143.4
yeah I'm just gonna

3138.72 --> 3145.0789999999997
give a legal complaint yeah

3143.4 --> 3148.14
that's gonna work

3145.079 --> 3151.079
by the way when I actually reported him

3148.14 --> 3154.859
on the channel and not just in my chat

3151.079 --> 3157.8590000000004
it worked they even continued asking

3154.859 --> 3161.7
questions it's like oh he's bullying

3157.859 --> 3166.88
about what so apparently if you report

3161.7 --> 3166.8799999999997
somebody in my chat nobody listens to it

3167.76 --> 3173.76
it's just not being responded to somehow

3170.099 --> 3175.619
but I went to his actual channel that

3173.76 --> 3178.2000000000003
doesn't have any content and then

3175.619 --> 3181.7000000000003
reported him from there

3178.2 --> 3181.7
seems like that's worked

3182.52 --> 3188.059
too many blocks no

3184.74 --> 3188.0589999999997
has nothing to do with that

3188.4 --> 3192.96
I don't know what the [ __ ] going on

3190.079 --> 3194.819
but this [ __ ] can just

3192.96 --> 3197.52
unblock himself

3194.819 --> 3199.38
oh hey that's a smart one LSG yeah just

3197.52 --> 3201.68
keep timing him out that can definitely

3199.38 --> 3201.6800000000003
work

3204.0 --> 3206.72
thank you

3210.24 --> 3214.5589999999997
he's gone no he hasn't

3212.339 --> 3216.48
wolf pack the guy doesn't have a [ __ ]

3214.559 --> 3218.0400000000004
life he said he'd gone back to work and

3216.48 --> 3220.859
he's still spamming

3218.04 --> 3224.2799999999997
he doesn't have any work

3220.859 --> 3226.98
he's a sniveling maggot [ __ ] that's

3224.28 --> 3228.42
gonna die in a few years because of his

3226.98 --> 3231.18
[ __ ] boosters

3228.42 --> 3233.4
he's probably already feeling it

3231.18 --> 3237.2999999999997
can't admit anything so it's just like

3233.4 --> 3239.46
I'm gonna harass and whine to a person

3237.3 --> 3242.04
the rest of my life which is going to be

3239.46 --> 3244.68
very short I'm just gonna do that

3242.04 --> 3247.079
but it seems like it was G figured out a

3244.68 --> 3251.2999999999997
way to keep him out by just timing him

3247.079 --> 3251.3
out that's brilliant by the way

3254.099 --> 3259.8590000000004
on YouTube for me

3256.92 --> 3263.3
you mean against the guy

3259.859 --> 3263.2999999999997
I take duper

3266.4 --> 3273.26
not against me I hope duper thank you I

3270.48 --> 3273.26
appreciate that

3273.78 --> 3279.8390000000004
see duper is not a bad person

3277.26 --> 3284.7200000000003
he's just a little thick when it comes

3279.839 --> 3284.72
to ball and flat stuff you know

3285.66 --> 3289.2599999999998
and I see sometimes that some of the

3287.579 --> 3291.8390000000004
Flat Earth is like really hate on you

3289.26 --> 3293.88
for some reason Neil and Michael Khan

3291.839 --> 3295.859
really don't like you

3293.88 --> 3298.819
I don't understand why they have to slap

3295.859 --> 3298.819
you around all the time

3299.88 --> 3303.6800000000003
but thank you for the assistance

3306.839 --> 3311.46
right anyway let's get back to the show

3310.14 --> 3313.7
the show it's not a very long show

3311.46 --> 3313.7
anyway

3317.4 --> 3323.359
Cooper is more entertaining than most

3319.2 --> 3323.359
Trump right exactly

3324.0 --> 3330.619
I mean I'd have I'd have 20 dupers over

3327.24 --> 3330.6189999999997
this Johnny [ __ ]

3332.66 --> 3335.81
[Music]

3342.839 --> 3345.5589999999997
foreign

3349.559 --> 3354.5400000000004
also a great name

3352.319 --> 3357.24
a great name of what you mean duper

3354.54 --> 3359.2
poons what does that even mean mean I

3357.24 --> 3362.37
don't know

3359.2 --> 3362.37
[Music]

3362.819 --> 3367.319
right

3364.98 --> 3369.96
so I I actually do want to figure out

3367.319 --> 3372.96
another name for the show because I

3369.96 --> 3375.18
don't want to give this scummy suck ass

3372.96 --> 3378.119
wipe even

3375.18 --> 3379.859
the honor of being in my title

3378.119 --> 3382.5
but I'm gonna have to actually talk

3379.859 --> 3384.5
about something else then

3382.5 --> 3384.5
um

3395.16 --> 3402.24
the two part is neutral nah I don't

3398.04 --> 3404.819
think so well you might do

3402.24 --> 3407.5789999999997
the devil takes the what's the fences

3404.819 --> 3410.72
the Raptor will you believe in a Rapture

3407.579 --> 3410.7200000000003
at least you really

3415.319 --> 3420.0589999999997
that

3416.4 --> 3421.98
that seems kind of silly

3420.059 --> 3424.26
I mean I don't think the Raptor is

3421.98 --> 3427.02
actually physical

3424.26 --> 3430.3390000000004
if there's any form of rapture it is in

3427.02 --> 3433.92
the dark world it is in the Beyond yeah

3430.339 --> 3437.94
the Rapture is in the afterlife how

3433.92 --> 3440.28
about that yeah you got another life

3437.94 --> 3442.14
that you might be able to touch through

3440.28 --> 3444.8390000000004
your dreams

3442.14 --> 3448.859
the life beyond death

3444.839 --> 3451.92
I think the Rapture might exist there

3448.859 --> 3454.2
not here not in a physical world I don't

3451.92 --> 3456.0
think so I don't believe that at all

3454.2 --> 3458.8799999999997
doesn't even make it doesn't even make

3456.0 --> 3461.76
any sense it already assumes things

3458.88 --> 3463.98
that are illogical about the very

3461.76 --> 3466.3390000000004
workings of the world

3463.98 --> 3468.9
so I think a lot of these supposed

3466.339 --> 3472.0789999999997
mythical events

3468.9 --> 3475.619
they're not literally physical

3472.079 --> 3478.319
and even predictions of events are not

3475.619 --> 3479.88
about the Physical Realm I don't believe

3478.319 --> 3481.98
that

3479.88 --> 3483.3
I think a lot of these things I think

3481.98 --> 3486.42
even like

3483.3 --> 3490.2000000000003
the the alleged return of Christ

3486.42 --> 3492.599
is not physical

3490.2 --> 3495.74
on the other side it does change

3492.599 --> 3495.7400000000002
everything by the way

3496.02 --> 3500.7
right

3497.04 --> 3502.5589999999997
but it's not like literally a man and he

3500.7 --> 3504.7799999999997
is Jesus isn't he gonna do exactly the

3502.559 --> 3507.3
same just as I don't believe he

3504.78 --> 3510.2400000000002
literally resurrected like that oh how

3507.3 --> 3513.3
dare you yeah I don't give a [ __ ]

3510.24 --> 3515.0989999999997
Christ wisdom is worth more than all the

3513.3 --> 3518.7000000000003
freaking imagine miracles in the world

3515.099 --> 3521.1600000000003
yeah who gives a [ __ ]

3518.7 --> 3523.68
and [ __ ] for the [ __ ] miracles for

3521.16 --> 3525.299
any reason his wisdom

3523.68 --> 3528.24
it's the only thing that really matters

3525.299 --> 3531.359
because that wisdom always works yeah

3528.24 --> 3535.2599999999998
we're resurrecting somebody never works

3531.359 --> 3538.88
yeah and any successful application of

3535.26 --> 3541.559
that recently no yeah because it's

3538.88 --> 3543.9
pointless it's just oh that makes him

3541.559 --> 3547.2000000000003
special that makes us allow to

3543.9 --> 3551.579
idolatrize him right it's pointless yeah

3547.2 --> 3554.819
but his wisdom can always be applied

3551.579 --> 3557.52
that's the real value so I don't even

3554.819 --> 3560.2799999999997
think that Jesus resurrected after death

3557.52 --> 3563.28
literally I think that he resurrected in

3560.28 --> 3565.52
the dark world and continued miracles

3563.28 --> 3569.52
on the other side

3565.52 --> 3571.92
communicated you could say as ghost form

3569.52 --> 3575.28
you could call it a ghost form it's like

3571.92 --> 3578.04
a ghost but super manifested

3575.28 --> 3581.599
and then maybe even in his ghost form he

3578.04 --> 3581.599
could actually have a physical

3581.7 --> 3585.72
body

3583.02 --> 3587.7599999999998
or seemingly physical body it's like a

3585.72 --> 3590.7
hologram body

3587.76 --> 3593.5200000000004
a hologram body after death which you

3590.7 --> 3595.319
could fear sort of compare and they

3593.52 --> 3598.38
don't want to be like oh how dare you

3595.319 --> 3600.9
are in but

3598.38 --> 3603.2400000000002
kind of why like Obi-Wan Kenobi after

3600.9 --> 3605.76
death right I mean he's still there

3603.24 --> 3607.859
isn't he in the movie he's still there

3605.76 --> 3610.1400000000003
he's like yeah he's dead but he's still

3607.859 --> 3612.0589999999997
there it's still him he can still do

3610.14 --> 3614.46
things he can still communicate he can

3612.059 --> 3616.799
do all kinds of things yeah

3614.46 --> 3618.359
well I think that is what happened with

3616.799 --> 3621.059
Jesus

3618.359 --> 3622.859
he manifested re-manifests and

3621.059 --> 3626.2200000000003
everybody's like what the hell is this

3622.859 --> 3628.5
or whoa praise God this is a miracle it

3626.22 --> 3630.359
is a miracle I mean that's pretty

3628.5 --> 3633.42
incredible if you can literally after

3630.359 --> 3635.819
death like holographically manifest

3633.42 --> 3638.579
yourself that's incredible

3635.819 --> 3640.38
that is absolutely incredible

3638.579 --> 3642.6600000000003
it is a miracle

3640.38 --> 3644.6400000000003
it is not literally resurrected that

3642.66 --> 3647.339
makes no freaking sense that's not how

3644.64 --> 3649.74
the flesh works

3647.339 --> 3654.0589999999997
so that's how I see it

3649.74 --> 3656.819
and I know that's very very remote from

3654.059 --> 3657.9
the Christian doctrine it's too freaking

3656.819 --> 3660.299
bad

3657.9 --> 3665.579
this is what I think I stick to logic

3660.299 --> 3668.819
I'll die for logic because truth is God

3665.579 --> 3670.079
and lies is Satan

3668.819 --> 3675.18
yeah

3670.079 --> 3679.1400000000003
and lies does not work with logic logic

3675.18 --> 3682.74
only works with truth logic is with God

3679.14 --> 3684.54
and if something cannot be logical

3682.74 --> 3687.0589999999997
cannot be resolved

3684.54 --> 3690.299
then it cannot be with God it cannot be

3687.059 --> 3693.0
true it can only be true if it's logical

3690.299 --> 3696.119
it's very simple and and I reach that

3693.0 --> 3699.96
extent to incredible lengths yeah this

3696.119 --> 3701.94
logic is not oh sorry and so that means

3699.96 --> 3704.099
that nothing spiritual can be real oh no

3701.94 --> 3707.88
[ __ ] spiritual things are definitely

3704.099 --> 3711.2400000000002
real and logical and palpable and

3707.88 --> 3714.839
visible and all these tangible aspects

3711.24 --> 3718.0789999999997
of it very very real yeah Miracles can

3714.839 --> 3721.859
be very physically real

3718.079 --> 3725.04
Powers Yeah I can [ __ ] heal at a

3721.859 --> 3728.0989999999997
distance I can absorb somebody's pain in

3725.04 --> 3731.04
their flesh at a distance yeah that's a

3728.099 --> 3734.04
[ __ ] miracle right I'm not

3731.04 --> 3737.54
downplaying anything like some atheist

3734.04 --> 3737.54
not nutty [ __ ]

3737.94 --> 3742.579
right

3739.92 --> 3746.2200000000003
like the guy in paranormal

3742.579 --> 3747.9
was it like he's like an atheist [ __ ] I

3746.22 --> 3749.5789999999997
I couldn't stand the character I mean he

3747.9 --> 3751.2000000000003
did have a Redemption a bit at the end

3749.579 --> 3753.3590000000004
but oh my God

3751.2 --> 3756.5989999999997
it was a bit grinding

3753.359 --> 3759.299
but I am not like that I don't have like

3756.599 --> 3761.819
oh spiritual can be real oh it's a

3759.299 --> 3764.24
hallucination so it can't be real no no

3761.819 --> 3764.24
no no no

3764.339 --> 3768.9
that's not how that works and have a lot

3766.68 --> 3770.46
of practical experience to reflect upon

3768.9 --> 3775.14
with all of that

3770.46 --> 3778.76
I've done research like personal actual

3775.14 --> 3782.22
physical research on myself

3778.76 --> 3786.3590000000004
concerning hallucinations

3782.22 --> 3789.54
and the other side experience yeah it

3786.359 --> 3793.2599999999998
was literally a conscious research for

3789.54 --> 3796.44
me I spent half my life because I was

3793.26 --> 3799.1400000000003
gonna have that [ __ ] anyway so I might

3796.44 --> 3801.839
just as well actually try to get

3799.14 --> 3805.14
something useful out of it other than oh

3801.839 --> 3807.0589999999997
poor me I have all these problems no I'm

3805.14 --> 3809.22
so poor yeah because everybody just

3807.059 --> 3811.5
hates that so I thought [ __ ] that I'm

3809.22 --> 3814.3799999999997
not gonna be a victim if I'm gonna have

3811.5 --> 3817.2
issues then I'm gonna use them

3814.38 --> 3819.42
I'm gonna use them for some good instead

3817.2 --> 3820.3799999999997
of just whining all day about poor old

3819.42 --> 3824.099
me

3820.38 --> 3826.02
hmm yeah because everybody hates people

3824.099 --> 3828.42
that only complain about their

3826.02 --> 3830.52
weaknesses everybody hates that I don't

3828.42 --> 3832.38
like that I don't want to be hated by

3830.52 --> 3834.48
everybody

3832.38 --> 3836.579
not that it's my main priority because

3834.48 --> 3838.619
I'll still be a flat earther quite

3836.579 --> 3841.5
outspoken and there's going to be a lot

3838.619 --> 3845.819
of people that hate that

3841.5 --> 3848.4
but naturally I don't want to be hated

3845.819 --> 3849.7799999999997
yeah I don't want to be this special boy

3848.4 --> 3853.2200000000003
victim

3849.78 --> 3853.2200000000003
I never had that in me

3857.22 --> 3862.6189999999997
what the hell was I talking about

3860.22 --> 3867.6189999999997
yeah research

3862.619 --> 3867.619
spiritual research and so yeah miracles

3867.839 --> 3873.799
it's just like

3869.64 --> 3873.799
magical things can happen

3873.9 --> 3881.1600000000003
it's just that physical reality isn't as

3877.14 --> 3884.46
restrained as our normalcy bias tends to

3881.16 --> 3889.5789999999997
make it look to us yeah that's how I see

3884.46 --> 3893.76
it I think magical incredible inherent

3889.579 --> 3896.28
designed by God things are absolutely

3893.76 --> 3899.76
everywhere and in everything there's

3896.28 --> 3900.96
something super magical in every form of

3899.76 --> 3903.8390000000004
life

3900.96 --> 3905.579
every form of life including bacterial

3903.839 --> 3907.98
life I think that we can actually

3905.579 --> 3911.88
psionically communicate with bacterial

3907.98 --> 3913.44
life yeah to make it do things I think

3911.88 --> 3915.1400000000003
that's possible

3913.44 --> 3920.059
yeah

3915.14 --> 3923.8799999999997
because the designer has incredible

3920.059 --> 3928.92
options available for us

3923.88 --> 3933.9
now it's up to us whether we can allow

3928.92 --> 3936.7200000000003
ourselves to reach out and use it or if

3933.9 --> 3939.1800000000003
we're going to be dragged down and held

3936.72 --> 3942.18
back by the devil

3939.18 --> 3945.68
through other people's Superstition and

3942.18 --> 3945.68
delusional nonsense

3945.839 --> 3951.0589999999997
like that old magic is of the devil

3948.9 --> 3952.98
it isn't

3951.059 --> 3955.26
yeah

3952.98 --> 3958.7400000000002
it's the intention

3955.26 --> 3961.44
that makes something of the devil it's

3958.74 --> 3963.839
not the thing you're doing

3961.44 --> 3967.7400000000002
it's the intention behind it

3963.839 --> 3970.319
why you're doing it what you want out of

3967.74 --> 3973.6189999999997
it and what you're going to ignore with

3970.319 --> 3975.299
it that is what determines

3973.619 --> 3977.4
not the thing

3975.299 --> 3980.24
how you do it why you do it and what

3977.4 --> 3980.2400000000002
you're going to do with it

3981.0 --> 3986.78
and Magic is all around us

3983.78 --> 3990.42
magical perception

3986.78 --> 3994.44
dream experiences that are quite surreal

3990.42 --> 3996.6800000000003
and have physical implications

3994.44 --> 3999.2400000000002
yeah

3996.68 --> 4003.859
synchronicities something that's kind of

3999.24 --> 4007.16
common is very magical and very surreal

4003.859 --> 4009.98
it makes us feel like this isn't even

4007.16 --> 4011.8999999999996
the real reality like it's a sub-layer

4009.98 --> 4013.4
and it's starting to like synchronize

4011.9 --> 4014.48
unnaturally

4013.4 --> 4018.319
yeah

4014.48 --> 4020.119
that's magical and it's right there all

4018.319 --> 4022.2799999999997
the freaking time and when it happens to

4020.119 --> 4024.619
you you feel like whoa God is with me or

4022.28 --> 4027.7400000000002
something because well maybe he is

4024.619 --> 4030.799
something magical is happening and that

4027.74 --> 4033.14
something magical that is happening is

4030.799 --> 4035.839
normal

4033.14 --> 4037.4
because it just happens

4035.839 --> 4040.0389999999998
that means

4037.4 --> 4042.02
it's normal it's in the design it's

4040.039 --> 4045.579
something that happens

4042.02 --> 4045.579
it's not unnatural

4045.68 --> 4051.319
it's not the devil at the end collecting

4048.38 --> 4054.319
your soul it's something that's inherent

4051.319 --> 4057.44
in the design of all things of the

4054.319 --> 4059.18
spirit of matter

4057.44 --> 4061.16
and all of it

4059.18 --> 4063.9199999999996
that's how I see it

4061.16 --> 4066.6189999999997
it's all logical

4063.92 --> 4069.559
if it's not logical then it's an

4066.619 --> 4073.2400000000002
illusion and all Illusions especially

4069.559 --> 4075.44
the ones that prevent you from

4073.24 --> 4078.339
understanding more

4075.44 --> 4082.2200000000003
are of Satan

4078.339 --> 4083.9
all illusions that prevent you from

4082.22 --> 4087.2599999999998
learning more

4083.9 --> 4090.319
in however way are of Satan and that's

4087.26 --> 4093.559
how I see it anything that prevents you

4090.319 --> 4094.62
from learning more about what is real is

4093.559 --> 4097.2390000000005
of Satan

4094.62 --> 4101.08
[Music]

4097.239 --> 4101.08
that's just how I see it

4109.52 --> 4114.4400000000005
deal earn your heart

4111.98 --> 4116.178999999999
seeing ghosts in the back yeah sure why

4114.44 --> 4120.4
not

4116.179 --> 4120.4
ghosts are not that special guys

4120.62 --> 4123.699
they really aren't

4125.779 --> 4131.6
I mean I've seen plenty of ghosts

4129.02 --> 4133.52
some really [ __ ] scary and some were

4131.6 --> 4135.679
just like sad

4133.52 --> 4137.6
and they were just lonely mostly those

4135.679 --> 4139.9400000000005
are not scary they're just real they

4137.6 --> 4142.58
feel really tragic that is it

4139.94 --> 4144.739
but they're actually quite easily helped

4142.58 --> 4147.3189999999995
it's the angry ones that are actually

4144.739 --> 4149.599999999999
annoying and dangerous potentially like

4147.319 --> 4151.759
they can [ __ ] with your

4149.6 --> 4154.9400000000005
with your Dynamics

4151.759 --> 4156.62
like angry ghosts

4154.94 --> 4159.379999999999
can like

4156.62 --> 4162.199
make you stuck

4159.38 --> 4164.179
it's weird how that works it's hard to

4162.199 --> 4166.5199999999995
explain it make you stuck

4164.179 --> 4169.219
that

4166.52 --> 4171.02
makes you stuck as in you can't figure

4169.219 --> 4172.52
things out

4171.02 --> 4174.02
or you

4172.52 --> 4177.02
yeah

4174.02 --> 4179.540000000001
or that you just can't get over feelings

4177.02 --> 4181.400000000001
right that's something that some people

4179.54 --> 4184.219
struggle with well when there's angry

4181.4 --> 4186.3189999999995
ghosts in the air because it is right

4184.219 --> 4188.6
some places it's just there's angry

4186.319 --> 4190.88
Spirit Well if you get a person that

4188.6 --> 4192.7390000000005
already has issues

4190.88 --> 4194.42
right like what I just described well

4192.739 --> 4197.739
they're gonna have it more

4194.42 --> 4200.66
right this is the type of data

4197.739 --> 4204.799999999999
I have to give

4200.66 --> 4206.3
based on my own sensory experiences in

4204.8 --> 4208.219
the field

4206.3 --> 4209.96
when I was still in the field and doing

4208.219 --> 4211.34
stuff and not just locked up in my room

4209.96 --> 4215.199
for 10 years

4211.34 --> 4215.1990000000005
because that's kind of what is now

4215.48 --> 4220.94
ghost is an echo how can you help an

4217.52 --> 4224.320000000001
echo yeah fair enough yeah you're right

4220.94 --> 4226.879999999999
steamy travel I am being slightly

4224.32 --> 4229.82
incoherent with my own technical terms

4226.88 --> 4232.04
yes I I meant spirit it's just

4229.82 --> 4234.94
everybody's if you see something you're

4232.04 --> 4234.94
gonna call it a ghost

4236.36 --> 4241.4
right

4237.56 --> 4243.8
in this case it is a spirit I don't

4241.4 --> 4245.36
actually visually see them because it's

4243.8 --> 4247.76
like not the

4245.36 --> 4249.38
The Apparition experience like you go in

4247.76 --> 4250.820000000001
summer you get a weird feeling or you

4249.38 --> 4252.38
fall asleep and then it's like well you

4250.82 --> 4255.38
have an experience you see a person you

4252.38 --> 4257.0
don't know and it's like who was that

4255.38 --> 4257.900000000001
well that's somebody that lived in this

4257.0 --> 4259.699
building

4257.9 --> 4263.36
something happened to them right that's

4259.699 --> 4265.159
a ghost you got a tape recording from

4263.36 --> 4268.219
the outside about something you don't

4265.159 --> 4270.679
know that's a ghost

4268.219 --> 4273.5
an actual spirit is something that's

4270.679 --> 4276.08
just there and it's like it is kind of

4273.5 --> 4277.94
like a ghost but there's the entity the

4276.08 --> 4279.5
Consciousness can be still be sort of

4277.94 --> 4282.379999999999
tied in with it

4279.5 --> 4284.6
but I never see those

4282.38 --> 4286.82
I just get to see the tape recordings

4284.6 --> 4288.320000000001
and that's what I consider a ghost and

4286.82 --> 4290.659
other people classified like that too

4288.32 --> 4294.679
actual Spirits I don't

4290.659 --> 4296.839999999999
see a face I don't see how they were I

4294.679 --> 4300.679
usually just see either a silhouette a

4296.84 --> 4304.400000000001
shadow a bit sort of half through things

4300.679 --> 4306.92
or or a white silhouette kind of like a

4304.4 --> 4309.08
little brighter than the rest and most

4306.92 --> 4311.42
pronounced as lead the feelings I just

4309.08 --> 4315.14
feel like there's somebody there

4311.42 --> 4317.4800000000005
and that's it that's the spirits oh I

4315.14 --> 4320.4800000000005
see and dude I have that sort of thing

4317.48 --> 4323.678999999999
like regularly like spirits come here

4320.48 --> 4323.678999999999
and visit me at night

4324.26 --> 4329.179
it's kind of weird but they're never

4326.719 --> 4331.52
threatening to me because I'm too strong

4329.179 --> 4334.52
and I am with Christ and all that and I

4331.52 --> 4336.1990000000005
have my my very special eclectic prayers

4334.52 --> 4339.860000000001
that work

4336.199 --> 4343.28
it really works like it's powerful

4339.86 --> 4344.5599999999995
because I made it my prayer it's my

4343.28 --> 4349.699
personal

4344.56 --> 4351.5
created prayer for me to God

4349.699 --> 4353.719
and like there's something really

4351.5 --> 4355.1
powerful about that because nobody told

4353.719 --> 4359.2390000000005
me what to do

4355.1 --> 4363.8
nobody told me to do it I just did it

4359.239 --> 4366.5599999999995
I did it from my own eclectic impulse

4363.8 --> 4368.54
and that makes it very powerful

4366.56 --> 4372.620000000001
because it works and it's all born

4368.54 --> 4375.4
naturally spiritually right anyway

4372.62 --> 4375.4
ah

4377.0 --> 4381.199
let's change his style it seems like

4378.679 --> 4382.58
Johnny's [ __ ] off by the way that's

4381.199 --> 4387.159
nice

4382.58 --> 4387.159
maybe bothers our Spirits snow

4403.99 --> 4407.639999999999
[Applause]

4419.66 --> 4424.01
[Applause]

4427.2 --> 4430.41
[Applause]

4432.02 --> 4434.860000000001
hmm

4447.5 --> 4453.88
okay I'm adapting a title because it

4450.38 --> 4453.88
yeah Johnny still in there

4456.98 --> 4463.339999999999
so now the title is

4460.04 --> 4466.04
Johnny the self unblocking troll

4463.34 --> 4468.5
thought that was appropriate

4466.04 --> 4471.739
Miracles and Magic are natural since

4468.5 --> 4474.58
that's the secondary subject here

4471.739 --> 4474.58
what do you guys think

4485.3 --> 4491.12
yeah because I don't believe that God

4488.26 --> 4494.719
intervenes and breaks the rules of his

4491.12 --> 4497.84
own machine I think God said because why

4494.719 --> 4501.02
the [ __ ] would he

4497.84 --> 4503.900000000001
the the idea that God from the outside

4501.02 --> 4507.02
would intervene in his design when he is

4503.9 --> 4510.44
a Timeless being would mean that his

4507.02 --> 4514.46
entire design was flawed and that it's

4510.44 --> 4516.08
necessary for him to intervene in order

4514.46 --> 4519.44
to keep it running

4516.08 --> 4522.26
that's the sign of a very poor design

4519.44 --> 4524.599999999999
yeah while he is the smartest and

4522.26 --> 4527.54
mightiest and he literally created

4524.6 --> 4530.54
information and matter it's completely

4527.54 --> 4533.84
ridiculous the idea that God from the

4530.54 --> 4538.34
outside would intervene

4533.84 --> 4539.179
instead of having made everything the

4538.34 --> 4545.42
way

4539.179 --> 4549.5
it is so that it can happen naturally

4545.42 --> 4551.96
that's how I see it Miracles are natural

4549.5 --> 4554.54
they were there it's just an amazing

4551.96 --> 4557.0
Revelation and you have to have a

4554.54 --> 4560.12
special focus and special Purity in your

4557.0 --> 4563.0
spirit to get there that's how I see it

4560.12 --> 4564.44
it's not like all the outside Almighty

4563.0 --> 4566.42
ones certainly like

4564.44 --> 4568.759999999999
yeah I'm gonna get in there and just

4566.42 --> 4571.1
like uh do you want to do this

4568.76 --> 4573.7390000000005
like what the [ __ ] man no

4571.1 --> 4576.64
no it's not a special thing God does

4573.739 --> 4580.159
it's something that was always there

4576.64 --> 4582.38
available for those who could

4580.159 --> 4585.5
attain it

4582.38 --> 4588.86
under specific conditions Purity and all

4585.5 --> 4592.219
that that's how I think it works

4588.86 --> 4594.5
I think that the idea of that God the

4592.219 --> 4595.82
outside designer that is timeless would

4594.5 --> 4598.88
just

4595.82 --> 4601.699
break into his own design and basically

4598.88 --> 4602.96
Break The Rules off the design if like

4601.699 --> 4604.5199999999995
how the [ __ ] would that even be a

4602.96 --> 4607.219
possible logical

4604.52 --> 4609.860000000001
to alter something to favor an

4607.219 --> 4612.679
individual like or or some or a group

4609.86 --> 4616.4
that just seems crazy to me it seems

4612.679 --> 4620.4800000000005
illogical it's like that I notion

4616.4 --> 4623.48
is is a suggestion that the designer is

4620.48 --> 4626.299999999999
actually inept

4623.48 --> 4628.459999999999
because he is a Timeless being that

4626.3 --> 4630.38
literally designed matter and

4628.46 --> 4632.78
information itself he created the

4630.38 --> 4635.84
akashic like like why would he design it

4632.78 --> 4639.32
all in a way that he would be required

4635.84 --> 4641.84
to subtly break the rules of the thing

4639.32 --> 4645.259999999999
that he made to intervene and change

4641.84 --> 4649.6990000000005
something that's ridiculous

4645.26 --> 4651.26
so you doubt the Perfection of the

4649.699 --> 4653.48
designer do you

4651.26 --> 4656.4800000000005
I don't

4653.48 --> 4656.48
ridiculous

4656.679 --> 4661.4800000000005
but anyway that's me that's just my

4666.62 --> 4670.76
title revision

4668.3 --> 4672.7390000000005
nah now I'm Gonna Keep Johnny in there

4670.76 --> 4674.659000000001
though

4672.739 --> 4677.239
it's the least I can do but I am gonna

4674.659 --> 4679.219
round out the show

4677.239 --> 4680.599999999999
so I hope you guys thought that was

4679.219 --> 4683.54
interesting

4680.6 --> 4685.58
or maybe you think I'm crazy

4683.54 --> 4687.739
probably not I don't really care because

4685.58 --> 4691.28
I'm eclectic this is what I'm figuring

4687.739 --> 4693.259999999999
out I definitely consider myself a

4691.28 --> 4695.84
follower of Christ

4693.26 --> 4699.9800000000005
but that does not take the entire

4695.84 --> 4702.860000000001
package of presuppositional weirdo Jew

4699.98 --> 4704.36
stuff in the Bible yeah it's definitely

4702.86 --> 4706.699
not included

4704.36 --> 4709.099999999999
I basically ignore most of those things

4706.699 --> 4710.659
although I still keep track of it to

4709.1 --> 4714.08
understand it better

4710.659 --> 4717.44
but I am mostly just following the very

4714.08 --> 4722.78
pure wisdom of Christ itself which

4717.44 --> 4723.86
you don't require all the prefaces in

4722.78 --> 4726.34
the Bible

4723.86 --> 4730.699
for the wisdom that comes out of Christ

4726.34 --> 4733.28
to be ultimate you don't need all those

4730.699 --> 4736.46
things to be the way there supposedly

4733.28 --> 4739.82
are or told you they are you don't need

4736.46 --> 4741.92
those things for Christ's wisdom to be

4739.82 --> 4745.34
Eternal you see and that's why I follow

4741.92 --> 4749.02
Christ wisdom and not all the

4745.34 --> 4752.56
hermeneutic garbage that surrounds it

4749.02 --> 4755.780000000001
that's specifically why

4752.56 --> 4759.1990000000005
logic applicability

4755.78 --> 4762.739
those are the factors

4759.199 --> 4764.599999999999
that are the most important for me to

4762.739 --> 4767.0599999999995
determine what is real and what is not

4764.6 --> 4768.7390000000005
right

4767.06 --> 4770.96
anyway

4768.739 --> 4773.48

support over the weekend that really

4801.92 --> 4805.76
helped

4803.48 --> 4808.879999999999
hey dress the legend haven't seen you in

4805.76 --> 4810.02
ages God's machine is perfect and you

4808.88 --> 4811.46
don't need to pray as you won't

4810.02 --> 4814.76
intervene

4811.46 --> 4817.28
no but that's not how it works

4814.76 --> 4820.34
you don't pray to God for him to

4817.28 --> 4824.0599999999995
intervene you prayed to God

4820.34 --> 4827.4400000000005
to make things work well

4824.06 --> 4829.400000000001
you connected God to remind yourself

4827.44 --> 4832.4
that you

4829.4 --> 4834.44
through connecting spiritually to him

4832.4 --> 4836.179
and like knowing what he wants and how

4834.44 --> 4838.759999999999
it works and what is real and what isn't

4836.179 --> 4841.04
real what is good and what is bad

4838.76 --> 4843.14
that's connecting to God and we're

4841.04 --> 4844.76
actively reminding it's like an

4843.14 --> 4847.54
experiment of social connection

4844.76 --> 4847.54
internally

4850.58 --> 4856.04
that's what it's about it's what makes

4852.679 --> 4860.9
energy flow it reminds you of how things

4856.04 --> 4863.3
really are it reduces wandering off in

4860.9 --> 4865.879999999999
seductions that might have happened so

4863.3 --> 4868.76
it brings you back to base to home base

4865.88 --> 4872.719
it's not about oh I need to pray to God

4868.76 --> 4875.56
for it to do something for me yeah God's

4872.719 --> 4875.56
Not Your Slave

4876.199 --> 4881.419999999999
that's ridiculous it's arrogant

4879.02 --> 4883.3
it's not how things work you can pray to

4881.42 --> 4886.46
God please make sure that everything

4883.3 --> 4888.92
becomes all right but technically you

4886.46 --> 4891.26
shouldn't need to you should just know

4888.92 --> 4892.34
he will you're correct from that

4891.26 --> 4893.54
perspective

4892.34 --> 4896.360000000001
right

4893.54 --> 4899.0
yeah people out there Christians do a

4896.36 --> 4901.159
lot of foolish things with Christianity

4899.0 --> 4903.02
that show that they have very little

4901.159 --> 4908.179
wisdom

4903.02 --> 4910.9400000000005
to apply to the miraculous depths of

4908.179 --> 4913.76
wisdom that can be found in the Bible

4910.94 --> 4916.4
and they see certain things and then

4913.76 --> 4918.320000000001
they don't see a whole range of other

4916.4 --> 4920.0599999999995
things and then they just say ah

4918.32 --> 4922.5199999999995
emmanuelic says that we have to think

4920.06 --> 4926.4800000000005
about it like this so that they don't

4922.52 --> 4929.719
open up and actually become

4926.48 --> 4932.419999999999
on the way of figuring out even further

4929.719 --> 4934.1
and getting even more into the esoterics

4932.42 --> 4936.08
because they just get hung up under her

4934.1 --> 4939.1990000000005
menuetics

4936.08 --> 4941.96
which the hermano addicts is purely

4939.199 --> 4944.48
there for the theocracy

4941.96 --> 4946.82
that's why it was created it's to

4944.48 --> 4948.86
reinterpret the wisdom

4946.82 --> 4951.58
so that everybody can just be the way

4948.86 --> 4951.58
they want it

4952.54 --> 4958.04
meanwhile's virtue signaling with the

4955.34 --> 4961.04
almighty savior

4958.04 --> 4962.9
then encouraging idolatry

4961.04 --> 4965.84
which you pretty sure Christ did not

4962.9 --> 4967.879999999999
intend to even though he did set say

4965.84 --> 4969.62
some weird esoteric things about oh

4967.88 --> 4972.32
being a follower and one and all that

4969.62 --> 4976.64
that's esoteric it's not literal yeah

4972.32 --> 4979.699
Jesus did esoteric talk very blatant

4976.64 --> 4981.679
yeah if you don't understand that and

4979.699 --> 4985.46
you think that everything he said is

4981.679 --> 4988.2390000000005
absolutely 100 literal then you're

4985.46 --> 4988.2390000000005
[ __ ]

4988.46 --> 4991.88
and I'm not gonna have a discussion with

4990.38 --> 4994.82
you about it

4991.88 --> 4997.88
because it's very blatantly obvious that

4994.82 --> 5002.199
Jesus was talking esoteric and not

4997.88 --> 5003.28
literal upon multiple occasions

5002.199 --> 5006.159
yeah

5003.28 --> 5009.04
and I'm not gonna let her menuetix tell

5006.159 --> 5012.28
me when it's literal and when it's

5009.04 --> 5014.44
metaphorical I will be the [ __ ] judge

5012.28 --> 5016.3
of that

5014.44 --> 5019.178999999999
I will

5016.3 --> 5021.159000000001
all right anyway
