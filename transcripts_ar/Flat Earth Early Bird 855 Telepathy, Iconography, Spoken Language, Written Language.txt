be much appreciated

83.2 --> 89.92
so whether today's quite

86.72 --> 89.92
beautiful again

91.36 --> 98.72
sun is behind the clouds right now

94.64 --> 104.0
but before

98.72 --> 104.0
it's just nice and sunny it's not windy

106.079 --> 109.19999999999999
i think it might have rained a little

108.399 --> 112.88
still

109.2 --> 116.07900000000001
last night has been raining

112.88 --> 118.64
yeah up and down a little besides the

116.079 --> 118.63999999999999
snowing

119.68 --> 128.479
right now it's really nice oh sun's

122.719 --> 131.759
coming back

128.479 --> 131.75900000000001
the birds out there

134.72 --> 143.84
are enjoying the spring

145.52 --> 148.87900000000002
all right let's see yeah

153.84 --> 161.44
it's tuesday the 6th

157.12 --> 161.44
of april 2021.

168.84 --> 171.84
um

176.8 --> 181.12
let's see yeah i i got up uh

181.68 --> 186.31900000000002
i don't feel like i really woken up

183.76 --> 186.319
fully yet

186.8 --> 189.68
got up like a

191.28 --> 199.2
15 minutes past 12 my time

195.28 --> 204.239
but i'm here and i'm awake and

199.2 --> 204.23899999999998
yesterday was interesting

204.799 --> 213.84
interesting flat earth debate show

206.959 --> 213.84
yesterday was very active

218.56 --> 223.68
right gary terry gary terry t's and with

221.76 --> 226.239
gary terry owen benjamin also

223.68 --> 228.48000000000002
saw it live it's a really good show

226.239 --> 228.48000000000002
again

234.159 --> 237.67999999999998
right oh yeah that that really stood out

236.48 --> 242.64
it was a little moment

237.68 --> 242.64000000000001
i didn't watch it all however

243.519 --> 247.12
oh benjamin basically i think he's done

246.72 --> 249.68
some

247.12 --> 252.08
digging on the scene over at flat earth

249.68 --> 252.08
because

252.64 --> 256.56
he did lay down basically the scientific

255.2 --> 260.239
method at some point

256.56 --> 262.32
and well recognizing that

260.239 --> 264.32
science is indeed the method

262.32 --> 267.52
specifically in how

264.32 --> 269.199
pseudoscientists and heliocentrists have

267.52 --> 272.08
stepped away from that

269.199 --> 273.12
so it was good for yeah to hear him say

272.08 --> 278.639
that

273.12 --> 278.639
and then later he started to basically

279.199 --> 288.72
link to cami nodel

283.6 --> 290.96000000000004
right so that was

288.72 --> 290.96000000000004
that

294.88 --> 301.52
right so apparently uh yeah he likes it

298.639 --> 301.52
he likes it

302.16 --> 305.91900000000004
or i don't know man maybe owen benjamin

305.6 --> 308.16
has

305.919 --> 310.08
uh has taken some look at the flatter

308.16 --> 312.88000000000005
debates and

310.08 --> 314.8
and me and he just doesn't like it he

312.88 --> 318.71999999999997
doesn't like

314.8 --> 322.639
kind of like the strongman attitude and

318.72 --> 324.56
i don't know didn't go into it

322.639 --> 326.24
in detail that i picked up on but i

324.56 --> 328.24
didn't watch i just

326.24 --> 329.68
picked up that he shouted her out and

328.24 --> 332.8
that's it

329.68 --> 332.8
it's a little like what

333.84 --> 337.28
i was also in the middle of making

335.44 --> 340.56
dinner and all that so i

337.28 --> 343.19899999999996
just didn't notice

340.56 --> 343.199
every part

343.919 --> 348.479
hello brandm you're first in chat good

347.12 --> 352.88
to see you

348.479 --> 356.24
oh wow how quickly things turn around

352.88 --> 356.71999999999997
right now it's snowing it's literally

356.24 --> 359.84000000000003
just

356.72 --> 359.84000000000003
started snowing here

364.84 --> 367.84
bizarre

377.36 --> 382.40000000000003
wow not a little too

380.4 --> 384.96
but yeah it's the big cloud coming over

382.4 --> 384.96
apparently

390.319 --> 395.84000000000003
that's weird

399.28 --> 402.88
hello rocket blimps

404.319 --> 409.84000000000003
welcome to the show

414.56 --> 416.88
uh

418.639 --> 423.68
what is it oh yeah i also went a little

421.36 --> 427.44
bit on 24 7 discord again

423.68 --> 427.44
didn't really hang out for too long

428.4 --> 437.84
uh what else

438.08 --> 441.75899999999996
oh yeah i pretty much rounded out the

440.24 --> 451.84000000000003
day just watching

441.759 --> 454.56
brandon's show part of it didn't get on

451.84 --> 457.599
right so i had a pretty calm day

454.56 --> 457.599
yesterday overall

463.12 --> 466.4
wow man

468.4 --> 472.15999999999997
that really came out of nowhere

472.24 --> 479.84000000000003
what a seeing change

479.919 --> 485.12
and yeah it seems more like it's hail

482.319 --> 487.28000000000003
not really snow

485.12 --> 488.24
but it's kind of floating like snow it's

487.28 --> 492.08
weird

488.24 --> 494.16
maybe it's mixed maybe there's

492.08 --> 507.84
is snow but there's also kind of hill in

494.16 --> 507.84000000000003
between i don't know it's weird

515.44 --> 523.2
hello nerobo ray leosis

520.24 --> 523.2
that's a weird name

527.279 --> 533.76
ah wow brandon really

530.88 --> 535.2
sun one minute then snow fog and hail

533.76 --> 539.36
later

535.2 --> 543.76
as well yeah that's weird wow my god

539.36 --> 543.76
damn it's really piling now

544.48 --> 549.839
and if you can see that laying on the

546.8 --> 549.8389999999999
roof there

560.56 --> 563.8389999999999
all right

572.08 --> 577.839
neuro borealosis

579.36 --> 582.88
all right let me check that

581.62 --> 591.839
[Music]

582.88 --> 591.8389999999999
never heard of it

602.839 --> 605.839
okay

608.8 --> 619.8389999999999
okay that is a real disease apparently

612.24 --> 619.839
it's lyme disease based

623.68 --> 628.959
migraines flu-like symptoms that sucks

631.36 --> 634.88
yeah don't get bit by ticks

634.959 --> 647.8389999999999
that's where you get lime from

638.24 --> 647.839
so they say

648.32 --> 654.8000000000001
right did you actually recover from it

652.0 --> 654.8
i don't know i

659.44 --> 675.839
oh [ __ ] man

677.279 --> 681.4399999999999
all right so you are recovering from

679.279 --> 689.8389999999999
that

681.44 --> 689.839
oh thank god that's not permanent

695.2 --> 700.8000000000001
so yeah how did you find this dream and

698.48 --> 702.9590000000001
also why would you call yourself after

700.8 --> 706.0
the disease you just

702.959 --> 716.4799999999999
recovered from not too long ago it seems

706.0 --> 730.959
a little weird

716.48 --> 733.279
the hearing loss is permanent oh [ __ ]

730.959 --> 733.279
all right

734.8 --> 745.8389999999999
so what brings you to this stream

749.36 --> 752.5600000000001
hello rocket blimps

755.92 --> 759.92
control demolition and strategic

758.56 --> 764.3199999999999
relocation

759.92 --> 764.3199999999999
do i know anything about it what

766.8 --> 777.5999999999999
about what it is yeah

773.6 --> 777.6
just curious erwin okay

781.04 --> 785.1999999999999
but i mean like are you familiar with

783.6 --> 801.839
flat earth how did you

785.2 --> 801.839
come across my channel

819.36 --> 822.88
all right so you're you're watching

821.44 --> 826.8000000000001
flutter streams all right

822.88 --> 826.8
well yeah my show is live every day

827.199 --> 830.56
glad you found me is there anything

829.519 --> 833.92
particular

830.56 --> 843.8389999999999
you're curious about

833.92 --> 843.8389999999999
trying to figure out

854.839 --> 857.839
so

859.839 --> 865.2790000000001
you think you've heard it all all right

862.24 --> 868.72
well if you watch nathan oakley

865.279 --> 872.8
live streams then you probably

868.72 --> 876.1600000000001
picked up on the the core arguments

872.8 --> 876.16
the housekeeping questions

880.32 --> 883.36
and how ballers struggled to avoid them

882.959 --> 886.2399999999999
and

883.36 --> 886.24
bypass them

895.279 --> 899.8389999999999
alright cool

907.279 --> 911.279
right so do you have you also figured

909.199 --> 914.4799999999999
out the issues with the

911.279 --> 917.519
like the original

914.48 --> 921.1990000000001
first presentation of typical flat earth

917.519 --> 922.8
the disc and sun and moon hovering over

921.199 --> 923.5999999999999
it do you understand what's wrong with

922.8 --> 927.8389999999999
that could you

923.6 --> 927.839
point that out if i ask you

933.68 --> 937.04
right i'm testing you now

937.12 --> 941.839
to see where you're at

948.88 --> 952.24
there's a lot wrong with that

950.56 --> 956.16
representation okay but

952.24 --> 959.6800000000001
can you name what what exactly

956.16 --> 959.68
is wrong with the presentation

966.839 --> 969.839
representation

983.759 --> 987.519
get some of this green tea

994.399 --> 997.68
the movement of the sun doesn't match up

996.72 --> 1011.839
with reality

997.68 --> 1011.8389999999999
really it doesn't

1012.48 --> 1017.1990000000001
area it needs to illuminate definitely

1014.959 --> 1025.12
doesn't all right well that's

1017.199 --> 1029.6
that's more of a baller objection

1025.12 --> 1032.9589999999998
well neuroborreliosis

1029.6 --> 1036.799
now it doesn't match up if you assume

1032.959 --> 1039.8390000000002
the the sun is a lamp a ball of fire

1036.799 --> 1041.839
hovering over the disk and directly

1039.839 --> 1043.52
illuminating everything yet then it

1041.839 --> 1048.1599999999999
doesn't fit

1043.52 --> 1050.799
because it's not what the sun is

1048.16 --> 1052.48
that's also part something i typically

1050.799 --> 1053.679
like to highlight during the flat earth

1052.48 --> 1067.84
debates when they ask

1053.679 --> 1067.8400000000001
any evidence for the distance to the sun

1069.919 --> 1077.44
what do i think the sun is then

1073.2 --> 1077.44
well i think it's light manifest

1077.6 --> 1081.6
and i think that the sun disc and all

1079.919 --> 1084.5590000000002
the celestial

1081.6 --> 1086.6399999999999
lights that we see at an angular

1084.559 --> 1089.84
position in relation to our observe

1086.64 --> 1091.5200000000002
observation point think they're all side

1089.84 --> 1095.1999999999998
effects

1091.52 --> 1097.679
so there's light manifesting arriving

1095.2 --> 1099.76
from that angular direction in relation

1097.679 --> 1104.96
to the position

1099.76 --> 1107.6
and we see the sun disk

1104.96 --> 1108.0
at the epicenter where that light is

1107.6 --> 1111.9189999999999
coming

1108.0 --> 1113.6
from if it is unless it's like concealed

1111.919 --> 1116.64
by something like a cloud

1113.6 --> 1116.6399999999999
or a thing in the way

1118.0 --> 1121.76
but there's not really sunlight coming

1120.559 --> 1126.0
from a specific

1121.76 --> 1126.0
euclidean position over the earth

1126.48 --> 1134.559
right so if you're on a flat earth disc

1130.16 --> 1138.24
model yeah then the triangulation of the

1134.559 --> 1140.799
angular positions of the sun apparition

1138.24 --> 1143.76
yeah it might match up to that distinct

1140.799 --> 1147.679
circular pattern over the presumed disc

1143.76 --> 1150.08
shaped flat earth but

1147.679 --> 1151.1200000000001
yeah that points to very specific

1150.08 --> 1153.76
coordinates

1151.12 --> 1154.3999999999999
over the presumed disc earth and then

1153.76 --> 1156.24
when you

1154.4 --> 1158.0
actually approach those specific

1156.24 --> 1158.96
coordinates in some way say like a

1158.0 --> 1162.4
balloon

1158.96 --> 1166.08
it turns out that's not where the sun

1162.4 --> 1168.72
really is no approach to it

1166.08 --> 1171.1999999999998
as you approach this euclidean presumed

1168.72 --> 1171.2
position

1177.84 --> 1182.9599999999998
say the sun beams move in curves now i'm

1180.96 --> 1185.039
saying the sun beams are practically

1182.96 --> 1186.88
holographic

1185.039 --> 1189.679
and they present themselves they

1186.88 --> 1193.8400000000001
manifest themselves specifically

1189.679 --> 1193.8400000000001
in relation to the observers location

1194.72 --> 1200.64
so it just appears to be a sun beam

1198.0 --> 1201.039
coming from a thing like as we would

1200.64 --> 1205.44
create

1201.039 --> 1209.679
light ourselves with a lamp or a candle

1205.44 --> 1209.679
but the celestial lights are not that

1214.24 --> 1217.84
are deduced from a flat oh

1218.84 --> 1224.3999999999999
oh you're starting to sound a little bit

1221.679 --> 1224.4
like a baller

1224.799 --> 1229.84
and we'll see where that goes i'm not

1227.36 --> 1229.84
afraid

1230.799 --> 1235.84
i've met all sorts

1236.799 --> 1240.08
right but no a sun beef doesn't move in

1239.12 --> 1242.7199999999998
curves

1240.08 --> 1242.72
it does not

1244.24 --> 1248.08
what i suggest is you take away the

1246.48 --> 1251.84
assumption of an

1248.08 --> 1255.039
origin point for this light that you

1251.84 --> 1258.24
perceive to be manifested in your

1255.039 --> 1259.679
in your position to take away that

1258.24 --> 1262.32
assumption

1259.679 --> 1264.88
then a whole lot of mistakes can be

1262.32 --> 1264.8799999999999
avoided

1269.44 --> 1278.72
so if they are oh there we go uh

1276.799 --> 1281.12
yeah the flat assumption you mean the

1278.72 --> 1282.24
flat assumption of there being no curve

1281.12 --> 1285.52
on earth

1282.24 --> 1287.36
like flat is definitely the geometric

1285.52 --> 1290.96
aspect of the earth's surface

1287.36 --> 1294.08
orientation that is definitively

1290.96 --> 1294.96
figured out that it is flat right that

1294.08 --> 1297.4399999999998
is something we have

1294.96 --> 1298.559
physical certainty of right doesn't

1297.44 --> 1300.88
really matter

1298.559 --> 1302.8799999999999
what else model aspect that has been

1300.88 --> 1306.159
built on top that

1302.88 --> 1306.159
if it fits or not

1307.039 --> 1309.76
what the hell

1310.88 --> 1315.0390000000002
doesn't really matter if it fits or not

1316.159 --> 1322.48
because we know it's flat

1319.44 --> 1324.96
we know it there's no signs of curvature

1322.48 --> 1327.919
concave or spherical

1324.96 --> 1328.88
whatsoever that's the thing we know with

1327.919 --> 1331.6000000000001
certainty

1328.88 --> 1332.3200000000002
in many different ways right now

1331.6 --> 1335.039
whatever

1332.32 --> 1336.08
you assume the celestial lights are in

1335.039 --> 1339.52
relation to

1336.08 --> 1341.84
the earth knowingly being flat

1339.52 --> 1343.12
that's your issue right and if you get

1341.84 --> 1345.28
it wrong

1343.12 --> 1346.7199999999998
that's your problem it's not a problem

1345.28 --> 1348.8799999999999
with the earth being flat

1346.72 --> 1350.48
it's a problem with your pre-assumption

1348.88 --> 1353.7600000000002
of what the celestial lights

1350.48 --> 1354.4
are you see because we know the earth is

1353.76 --> 1356.72
flat

1354.4 --> 1358.88
because it's definitely not spherical

1356.72 --> 1360.0
it's definitely not curved the horizon

1358.88 --> 1363.6000000000001
is definitely not

1360.0 --> 1367.44
a sphere edge that conceals things

1363.6 --> 1367.4399999999998
behind it geometrically

1372.64 --> 1375.919
then why does the geometry what part

1375.039 --> 1378.96
about

1375.919 --> 1380.5590000000002
the earth being flat doesn't work out

1378.96 --> 1384.96
geometrically

1380.559 --> 1384.96
neural borrowed by the [ __ ]

1387.039 --> 1390.32
just going to call you nero

1394.88 --> 1398.64
because you're certainly shoving some

1397.48 --> 1401.52
geometrical

1398.64 --> 1403.039
error about the physical earth's

1401.52 --> 1404.6399999999999
orientation

1403.039 --> 1406.48
you're shoving that at my feet like

1404.64 --> 1408.48
that's my problem or that's flat

1406.48 --> 1410.799
earthers problem

1408.48 --> 1411.6
there's no real geometric issues with

1410.799 --> 1414.32
the earth

1411.6 --> 1414.32
being flat

1415.2 --> 1418.64
yeah do you cleaning your coordinates of

1416.96 --> 1422.08
the sun does it match

1418.64 --> 1425.679
yeah you know why because there is

1422.08 --> 1428.799
no euclidean position of the sun

1425.679 --> 1428.799
that's the point

1429.12 --> 1436.8799999999999
yeah you understand there is

1432.559 --> 1441.2
no euclidean position of the sun

1436.88 --> 1444.24
it's not a light in a position

1441.2 --> 1448.0800000000002
it's a side effect to light

1444.24 --> 1451.919
manifesting in relation to the observer

1448.08 --> 1455.84
it's a side effect just seems to come

1451.919 --> 1457.5200000000002
from a euclidean position if the offset

1455.84 --> 1459.12
the presupposition within the

1457.52 --> 1462.08
triangulation process

1459.12 --> 1464.1589999999999
is that the earth beneath you is a disk

1462.08 --> 1467.1999999999998
specifically it is not flat

1464.159 --> 1468.159
a disk and then when you presume it's a

1467.2 --> 1470.4
disk

1468.159 --> 1472.24
then the triangulation process will

1470.4 --> 1475.52
yield a suggestion

1472.24 --> 1476.96
of a circular euclidean path over the

1475.52 --> 1478.8799999999999
presumed disc earth

1476.96 --> 1480.4
does it mean oh that means it's not flat

1478.88 --> 1484.0
now that means

1480.4 --> 1486.64
that the presumption of the sun

1484.0 --> 1489.44
being in a specific euclidean position

1486.64 --> 1492.24
based on triangulation

1489.44 --> 1492.24
is false

1492.64 --> 1500.159
it's just a mistake mistake based on the

1496.88 --> 1503.7600000000002
offset assumption that the sun

1500.159 --> 1507.44
is a light in a euclidean position

1503.76 --> 1510.8799999999999
shining its light onto you

1507.44 --> 1514.24
that's the mistake it's not the earth

1510.88 --> 1517.3600000000001
being flat that is the mistake

1514.24 --> 1521.36
it's very simple the sun is not a

1517.36 --> 1528.08
object in a euclidean position

1521.36 --> 1530.32
that's where the error comes in

1528.08 --> 1532.24
well look you're quote mining right now

1530.32 --> 1534.559
and starting to piss me off so i don't

1532.24 --> 1536.799
give a [ __ ] what condition you had

1534.559 --> 1539.2
for whatever reason if you're gonna act

1536.799 --> 1541.679
all baller-ish and quote-mining me

1539.2 --> 1542.96
as i explain these things in detail to

1541.679 --> 1545.6000000000001
you right now

1542.96 --> 1546.64
i'm just going to kick you you

1545.6 --> 1548.8799999999999
understand

1546.64 --> 1550.48
if you're going to be a bald [ __ ] i

1548.88 --> 1551.679
don't care what [ __ ] medical

1550.48 --> 1553.76
condition you have

1551.679 --> 1554.72
if you're going to be a bald heart quote

1553.76 --> 1556.559
minding me

1554.72 --> 1559.52
putting words in my mouth that i didn't

1556.559 --> 1563.2
say taking things i said out of context

1559.52 --> 1565.52
i am going to kick you take that as a

1563.2 --> 1568.0
fair warning

1565.52 --> 1569.12
right so you're going to respond

1568.0 --> 1571.84
properly

1569.12 --> 1572.32
to the statements i made in response to

1571.84 --> 1576.08
your

1572.32 --> 1581.6
claims or i will kick you

1576.08 --> 1581.6
for being disingenuous do you understand

1582.84 --> 1585.84
nero

1592.64 --> 1598.48
it seems seems like a way simpler reason

1595.919 --> 1601.5200000000002
oh the simpler reason

1598.48 --> 1604.24
so simple to just reject

1601.52 --> 1605.76
the earth being flat because you can't

1604.24 --> 1609.679
have your [ __ ] little light

1605.76 --> 1612.4
in a specific position is that it

1609.679 --> 1613.44
that's really sad of you that you need

1612.4 --> 1616.96
your sun

1613.44 --> 1618.72
light bulb to be physical out there

1616.96 --> 1620.4
that if that's not the case then the

1618.72 --> 1622.96
earth can't be flat

1620.4 --> 1627.8400000000001
talk about physicality assumption bias

1622.96 --> 1627.8400000000001
holding you back buddy

1634.24 --> 1640.3990000000001
so well yeah me possibly being wrong you

1638.399 --> 1643.6789999999999
haven't presented anything

1640.399 --> 1645.6
that even addresses my position

1643.679 --> 1646.88
right because you don't understand

1645.6 --> 1648.799
because you couldn't get it through your

1646.88 --> 1651.6000000000001
head that the sun might not be

1648.799 --> 1653.12
a light bulb hanging in a euclidean

1651.6 --> 1656.08
space

1653.12 --> 1658.799
you can't handle that apparently so now

1656.08 --> 1661.76
you're just playing the victim and

1658.799 --> 1663.52
trying to gaslight me oh you oh you

1661.76 --> 1666.559
can't let go that the earth

1663.52 --> 1668.08
may not be flat because it's not a lamp

1666.559 --> 1671.279
hanging somewhere

1668.08 --> 1673.52
oh yeah yeah in the meantime

1671.279 --> 1675.279
the actual evidence the ground-based

1673.52 --> 1677.76
earth-based evidence with

1675.279 --> 1678.32
measuring physical things and all that

1677.76 --> 1680.8799999999999
yeah

1678.32 --> 1682.1589999999999
it turns out the earth is not a sphere

1680.88 --> 1685.279
right

1682.159 --> 1687.7600000000002
it doesn't freaking matter the lights up

1685.279 --> 1690.24
there that we perceive

1687.76 --> 1691.2
that seem to be in some kind of angular

1690.24 --> 1693.76
position

1691.2 --> 1694.88
in relation to our observation doesn't

1693.76 --> 1698.0
really matter

1694.88 --> 1698.7990000000002
to the factual measurements of what is

1698.0 --> 1702.72
down here

1698.799 --> 1707.679
on earth physical things being measured

1702.72 --> 1711.84
yeah the earth is flat

1707.679 --> 1711.8400000000001
get over it

1711.919 --> 1716.48
see there you go this is a ball tart

1714.399 --> 1718.399
dude

1716.48 --> 1720.3990000000001
we had a pretty sneaky entrance but

1718.399 --> 1721.4399999999998
you've been unraveled you've been

1720.399 --> 1724.6399999999999
uncovered

1721.44 --> 1727.919
good luck with that some more boldheart

1724.64 --> 1727.919
rooms for you to hang around

1728.159 --> 1732.64
for all the housekeeping questions you

1730.159 --> 1733.919
know you obviously didn't understand

1732.64 --> 1738.3200000000002
them or you wouldn't be

1733.919 --> 1753.8400000000001
saying this crap in my chat right now

1738.32 --> 1753.84
you are a baltard

1768.48 --> 1773.919
no i'm not kicking you now i'm just

1770.72 --> 1777.44
exposing you for being a bald tart

1773.919 --> 1780.24
straw manning me trying to guess like me

1777.44 --> 1782.0800000000002
right trying to sneak in little

1780.24 --> 1782.559
assumptions like i wouldn't pick up on

1782.08 --> 1784.399
that

1782.559 --> 1785.76
right so you obviously don't know me

1784.399 --> 1788.6399999999999
well enough because i do

1785.76 --> 1789.6
absolutely pick up on that you can't

1788.64 --> 1794.48
sneak

1789.6 --> 1799.039
anything past me in my chat

1794.48 --> 1802.72
okay yeah you know why that is

1799.039 --> 1805.76
because i'm smarter than you

1802.72 --> 1807.84
bet you like that don't you

1805.76 --> 1809.039
i'm the flat earther and i'm smarter

1807.84 --> 1810.1589999999999
than you

1809.039 --> 1812.8799999999999
because you're still stuck in

1810.159 --> 1816.0800000000002
physicality assumption bias

1812.88 --> 1819.2
you still think that it's

1816.08 --> 1822.96
normal and okay to try to

1819.2 --> 1824.88
gaslight quote mine all that

1822.96 --> 1826.799
that's normal to you still that's why

1824.88 --> 1837.8400000000001
you're doing this

1826.799 --> 1840.32
yeah i don't have to kick you for that

1837.84 --> 1843.12
hello george sanford and seeking star

1840.32 --> 1843.12
wars by the way

1844.159 --> 1851.8400000000001
yeah baldy cats also here

1852.88 --> 1856.5590000000002
so it seems like uh mr globette's going

1855.6 --> 1858.1589999999999
away now

1856.559 --> 1860.0
after having been confronted with

1858.159 --> 1862.0
certain psychological issues that he

1860.0 --> 1864.08
cannot resolve

1862.0 --> 1866.399
in his approach of trying to understand

1864.08 --> 1869.36
the cosmogeny

1866.399 --> 1869.36
and that's all fine

1872.24 --> 1879.1200000000001
you know until you try to basically

1875.6 --> 1880.7199999999998
quote mine what i said and straw man me

1879.12 --> 1882.7199999999998
and gaslight me that's

1880.72 --> 1885.039
when things get personal and that's a

1882.72 --> 1888.08
sign that you have

1885.039 --> 1889.919
bumped into certain obstacles in your

1888.08 --> 1893.279
understanding that you cannot overcome

1889.919 --> 1896.64
so then the ego steps in and starts to

1893.279 --> 1899.44
cause deviations yeah

1896.64 --> 1901.8400000000001
cause little issues to make it more

1899.44 --> 1905.1200000000001
complicated to move away

1901.84 --> 1906.0
from the presented arguments that are a

1905.12 --> 1909.1999999999998
little too

1906.0 --> 1910.88
hard for you to get through get through

1909.2 --> 1914.3990000000001
to you

1910.88 --> 1916.0
so yeah i got the situation perfectly

1914.399 --> 1918.559
under control

1916.0 --> 1921.84
don't need to ban him for that see see

1918.559 --> 1921.84
how that worked out

1932.88 --> 1935.8400000000001
ah

1938.72 --> 1942.24
eric dollar has great info on the sun

1940.799 --> 1944.6399999999999
yeah yeah george sanford yeah eric

1942.24 --> 1947.1200000000001
dollard has been

1944.64 --> 1948.0800000000002
talking about sun complications for a

1947.12 --> 1952.9599999999998
long time like

1948.08 --> 1952.96
even way before i made it just a staple

1954.48 --> 1963.6
a bit stable

1957.6 --> 1968.9599999999998
system within my explanations

1963.6 --> 1968.9599999999998
like he was on to that even before i was

1970.799 --> 1975.519
and there were others too you know

1973.12 --> 1977.12
there's been signs way before that just

1975.519 --> 1980.24
people figuring out the sun

1977.12 --> 1982.32
is not a literal ball of fire hanging

1980.24 --> 1983.36
somewhere whether it's very far away or

1982.32 --> 1986.24
close by

1983.36 --> 1987.12
that's something else and suggestions

1986.24 --> 1989.1200000000001
maybe it's

1987.12 --> 1992.08
electrical somehow it's like an

1989.12 --> 1994.1589999999999
electrical or plasmic phenomenon

1992.08 --> 1995.84
doesn't seem to be a physical burning

1994.159 --> 1998.24
ball anywhere

1995.84 --> 1998.8799999999999
and yeah i basically move that towards

1998.24 --> 2001.279
no

1998.88 --> 2004.5590000000002
it's not anything it's a side effect of

2001.279 --> 2006.799
light manifesting

2004.559 --> 2008.0
in relation to the observer from that

2006.799 --> 2011.44
very specific

2008.0 --> 2012.799
angular position in relation to that

2011.44 --> 2014.559
observer

2012.799 --> 2016.0
and then it's just a side effect you see

2014.559 --> 2018.24
the sun there

2016.0 --> 2020.48
does it mean it's literally there even

2018.24 --> 2024.88
though you could triangulate it

2020.48 --> 2027.1200000000001
with the offset presuppositional layout

2024.88 --> 2030.0
orientation of the earth

2027.12 --> 2031.9189999999999
and then hey the the triangulation

2030.0 --> 2032.64
coordinates that come out of that yeah

2031.919 --> 2035.519
you could

2032.64 --> 2036.159
assume that the sun is actually a thing

2035.519 --> 2039.44
hovering

2036.159 --> 2042.48
in a circle over a disk

2039.44 --> 2046.48
when you go there to that euclidean

2042.48 --> 2049.44
location it's not really there

2046.48 --> 2050.2400000000002
because the sun isn't anywhere it's not

2049.44 --> 2053.359
an object

2050.24 --> 2056.24
it's a side effect the disc we see is a

2053.359 --> 2059.359
side effect like a hologram

2056.24 --> 2063.359
signature of that specific light

2059.359 --> 2065.04
manifesting and the same goes for all

2063.359 --> 2066.879
the other celestial lights so the

2065.04 --> 2069.7599999999998
moonlight

2066.879 --> 2070.24
i'm assuming the same thing about it the

2069.76 --> 2072.5600000000004
moon

2070.24 --> 2074.24
is not a physical object and that is

2072.56 --> 2077.04
even more difficult because

2074.24 --> 2080.24
yeah it has so many traits that suggest

2077.04 --> 2083.2
some kind of physical relation

2080.24 --> 2085.5989999999997
right it's very tough people go full

2083.2 --> 2088.0789999999997
lunatic about it

2085.599 --> 2091.119
because yeah it's so easy to imagine

2088.079 --> 2091.119
that it is physical

2101.44 --> 2105.359
all right yeah i almost forgot i did

2103.359 --> 2107.7599999999998
also watch the wakey wakey video you

2105.359 --> 2107.7599999999998
linked to

2108.56 --> 2116.56
and yeah it was it was decent but

2111.76 --> 2120.0
yeah i don't really like his format like

2116.56 --> 2122.64
it's so flashy

2120.0 --> 2124.48
lots of memes and even though he had

2122.64 --> 2126.3199999999997
good stuff put together like it

2124.48 --> 2127.839
it kind of gives me a headache like i

2126.32 --> 2132.079
wouldn't want to watch like

2127.839 --> 2135.839
multiple of his videos consecutively

2132.079 --> 2145.8390000000004
it makes me kind of numb but still yeah

2135.839 --> 2145.839
he brings together good stuff

2156.839 --> 2160.88
so

2158.079 --> 2162.4
right so you can stop well because that

2160.88 --> 2165.04
because he tries to

2162.4 --> 2167.119
fit too much in it he's kind of

2165.04 --> 2170.72
scattered

2167.119 --> 2173.28
right so that really plays into

2170.72 --> 2175.1189999999997
yeah lack of attention maybe that is his

2173.28 --> 2178.32
personal problem too maybe his

2175.119 --> 2180.7200000000003
bit of a adhd issue wouldn't be

2178.32 --> 2183.599
surprised

2180.72 --> 2185.04
because that is how it feels to me and

2183.599 --> 2186.6400000000003
that's why i don't really like it that

2185.04 --> 2189.599
much because it doesn't have

2186.64 --> 2189.5989999999997
proper focus

2190.079 --> 2192.96
it's too scattered

2194.16 --> 2197.2
but still fine you know if you if you

2195.92 --> 2197.839
like his channel if you like what he

2197.2 --> 2202.0789999999997
does i

2197.839 --> 2205.2
totally get it i'm not trying to diss

2202.079 --> 2205.2000000000003
on wakey wakey

2205.68 --> 2215.839
it's just not really good for me

2217.2 --> 2222.16
all right well so busy yeah yeah well

2219.76 --> 2224.1600000000003
everybody can be so busy

2222.16 --> 2226.0
when somebody's like that it's not busy

2224.16 --> 2228.0789999999997
it's just scattered when you're busy

2226.0 --> 2230.88
because you can't stop it's not busy

2228.079 --> 2230.88
it's scattered

2240.839 --> 2243.839
adhd

2248.079 --> 2253.3590000000004
but he is sincere and helpful to you

2249.839 --> 2256.0789999999997
well that's good seeking star order

2253.359 --> 2256.72
i'm not saying he's a bad person at all

2256.079 --> 2258.8
just saying

2256.72 --> 2260.72
not saying that not saying wakey wakey

2258.8 --> 2264.88
is a bad person

2260.72 --> 2268.48
it's just that his style you know

2264.88 --> 2270.56
i i don't take it in

2268.48 --> 2271.52
that well and there's a lot of people

2270.56 --> 2274.0789999999997
out there

2271.52 --> 2276.24
it's just this kind of hyperactive thing

2274.079 --> 2276.2400000000002
and

2276.4 --> 2279.52
i try to avoid it

2280.16 --> 2288.0789999999997
maybe that's why my show is so linear

2284.96 --> 2291.2
and non-flashy and just

2288.079 --> 2293.92
having time in between where nothing is

2291.2 --> 2297.359
said those are things hyperactive people

2293.92 --> 2300.64
can't do they can't do it they go nuts

2297.359 --> 2303.839
when they do that right

2300.64 --> 2308.0
i used to have that i

2303.839 --> 2308.0
don't anymore

2309.599 --> 2313.839
because it drained it out of me

2316.24 --> 2327.839
hello here we go again by the way

2319.359 --> 2327.839
wow to what

2335.52 --> 2341.839
low energy arwen

2338.72 --> 2341.839
what do you mean

2347.92 --> 2352.8
you're learning so much i bet you are

2350.64 --> 2356.3199999999997
bolly cats

2352.8 --> 2356.32
i hope it actually sticks

2358.96 --> 2362.88
dissing fellow fears of course i'm not

2361.2 --> 2369.839
dissing him

2362.88 --> 2369.839
what the hell

2372.16 --> 2375.359
it's just called honest criticism and i

2374.48 --> 2378.96
think he's

2375.359 --> 2379.44
a great channel like even way back he

2378.96 --> 2381.839
had some

2379.44 --> 2382.8
really awesome videos that i very much

2381.839 --> 2386.24
appreciated

2382.8 --> 2389.92
i thought was very inspiring so no

2386.24 --> 2394.24
wakey wakey is cool it's just that

2389.92 --> 2397.599
the way he builds his presentations

2394.24 --> 2398.72
it's too quick it's like too hyperactive

2397.599 --> 2401.52
for me i i

2398.72 --> 2403.4399999999996
i don't digest it well because of the

2401.52 --> 2411.839
format so i'm calling format

2403.44 --> 2411.839
fallacy basically sort of

2413.2 --> 2418.0
he predicted the plan dammit got out

2416.079 --> 2420.4
ahead of it

2418.0 --> 2420.4
all right

2421.92 --> 2428.8
well i i way back like even alex jones

2426.16 --> 2429.2
laid out certain types of plans and

2428.8 --> 2432.96
that's

2429.2 --> 2435.68
10 years ago that i remember seeing

2432.96 --> 2437.28
and even freaking 20 years ago no that's

2435.68 --> 2439.839
not true

2437.28 --> 2441.599
yeah i was like head on confronted with

2439.839 --> 2444.96
it i just

2441.599 --> 2447.28
i just didn't want to make it

2444.96 --> 2449.76
all about that because i wanted to stick

2447.28 --> 2452.0
to flat earth

2449.76 --> 2453.0400000000004
i kind of like don't want to deal with

2452.0 --> 2454.88
this [ __ ]

2453.04 --> 2456.48
that's happening right now that's why i

2454.88 --> 2460.319
didn't address it that's why i didn't

2456.48 --> 2460.319
make my channel all about that

2461.599 --> 2466.7200000000003
but what i did do is when the coronu

2463.68 --> 2469.9199999999996
situation basically presented itself

2466.72 --> 2473.2799999999997
i was one of the first channels out here

2469.92 --> 2474.96
that said viruses aren't what they say

2473.28 --> 2478.7200000000003
they are

2474.96 --> 2481.119
nothing about it is right so

2478.72 --> 2482.8799999999997
i was pretty early with that as it

2481.119 --> 2484.7200000000003
unfolded at least

2482.88 --> 2486.8
yeah i could have said five years ago oh

2484.72 --> 2487.839
there's a medical tyranny coming there's

2486.8 --> 2489.44
a medical tyranny

2487.839 --> 2491.119
coming right you know what would have

2489.44 --> 2491.839
happened if i'd done that on a regular

2491.119 --> 2493.6800000000003
basis

2491.839 --> 2496.88
everybody would just start calling me

2493.68 --> 2498.8799999999997
alex jones and then walk away

2496.88 --> 2502.4
that's what would have happened that's

2498.88 --> 2502.4
why i didn't do that constantly

2503.44 --> 2506.96
right what is the point of predicting

2505.44 --> 2509.04
something if there's nothing you can do

2506.96 --> 2513.04
to stop it or adapt to it that's right

2509.04 --> 2513.04
exactly now you're getting it

2516.48 --> 2522.4
yeah it's cassandra complex just because

2520.0 --> 2524.56
you know something ahead of time

2522.4 --> 2537.839
is going to happen is being planned

2524.56 --> 2537.839
doesn't mean you can stop it

2540.0 --> 2551.839
yes nothing like alex what

2554.72 --> 2561.52
good on him dude

2558.72 --> 2562.7999999999997
yeah look if you like mark i'm not

2561.52 --> 2566.48
trying to diss him

2562.8 --> 2569.119
okay it's called fair criticism

2566.48 --> 2570.64
right i expect that people give that to

2569.119 --> 2573.359
me

2570.64 --> 2574.56
and i give it to people even if on the

2573.359 --> 2576.56
surface

2574.56 --> 2578.7999999999997
they might not like it or their fans

2576.56 --> 2581.92
might not like it because people

2578.8 --> 2585.44
need that it's called

2581.92 --> 2589.2000000000003
honesty honesty no matter what

2585.44 --> 2593.839
inconvenient honesty one would say

2589.2 --> 2593.839
i use it as much as i can

2602.4 --> 2606.2400000000002
right but it's pretty cool that he

2603.92 --> 2607.2000000000003
adapted to the draconian measures in his

2606.24 --> 2609.359
own way

2607.2 --> 2610.48
in my own right i have two you know one

2609.359 --> 2613.92
of the things

2610.48 --> 2618.0
the way i did it is not having

2613.92 --> 2619.119
a smartphone ever not being part of

2618.0 --> 2623.04
facebook

2619.119 --> 2629.599
ever not having twitter

2623.04 --> 2632.0
right not getting any more vaccines

2629.599 --> 2634.0
making sure i got water purification i

2632.0 --> 2635.76
tried air purification but that

2634.0 --> 2638.4
thing broke down i don't have money to

2635.76 --> 2638.4
replace it

2638.64 --> 2642.64
so yeah i did a lot myself

2647.359 --> 2651.44
but it's good to hear that he did also

2649.599 --> 2653.76
it's very smart thing of him to do and

2651.44 --> 2657.599
i'm glad he had the

2653.76 --> 2663.8390000000004
life maneuverability to really do that

2657.599 --> 2663.839
in his way

2684.72 --> 2689.5989999999997
yeah here we go again i'm not talking

2687.04 --> 2690.8
about what alex blabbers on like oh this

2689.599 --> 2692.56
is gonna have that no

2690.8 --> 2695.04
talking about the time when he brought

2692.56 --> 2697.359
forth the documents

2695.04 --> 2698.64
he just read that [ __ ] that that's being

2697.359 --> 2701.2
recycled right now

2698.64 --> 2702.0789999999997
on over at alex jones constantly because

2701.2 --> 2705.2
he did

2702.079 --> 2707.599
do that i was there watching it live

2705.2 --> 2708.48
when you roll out the official planning

2707.599 --> 2712.079
documents

2708.48 --> 2715.119
for the pandemic in this belief that

2712.079 --> 2715.119
they would do that

2716.839 --> 2721.52
right and that's ten years ago

2722.72 --> 2727.7599999999998
not talking about when alex just in

2725.599 --> 2729.6800000000003
between whatever he's doing blabbers on

2727.76 --> 2730.1600000000003
oh this is come go the attack is coming

2729.68 --> 2732.0
that

2730.16 --> 2733.839
yeah he does that [ __ ] all the time well

2732.0 --> 2735.119
that's not something i care about what i

2733.839 --> 2737.04
care about is when he

2735.119 --> 2738.1600000000003
actually brings in the documents you

2737.04 --> 2740.8
read a whole

2738.16 --> 2747.839
batch again about plans being made

2740.8 --> 2747.8390000000004
that's the time when i pay attention

2751.28 --> 2757.0400000000004
cool living marcus living completely

2753.92 --> 2761.839
off-grid that's awesome

2757.04 --> 2761.839
very cool

2783.76 --> 2788.7200000000003
oh by the way hello amanda young almost

2785.92 --> 2803.839
missed you there

2788.72 --> 2803.839
and clutch bear

2808.72 --> 2814.24
okay oh here we go again yeah

2812.319 --> 2815.52
you had listened harder to his warnings

2814.24 --> 2818.3999999999996
well what exactly

2815.52 --> 2818.96
in his warnings could you do anything

2818.4 --> 2820.7200000000003
with

2818.96 --> 2822.16
like were you in the position to

2820.72 --> 2824.8799999999997
actually

2822.16 --> 2825.359
find a safer place and get off grid and

2824.88 --> 2828.839
all that

2825.359 --> 2830.96
were you actually in the position to do

2828.839 --> 2845.839
that

2830.96 --> 2845.839
because i sure wasn't

2856.839 --> 2859.839
hmm

2894.8 --> 2897.04
mo

2898.4 --> 2902.559
if you had concentrated on becoming

2900.4 --> 2905.6800000000003
financially free earlier

2902.559 --> 2906.8
i could be independent right well you're

2905.68 --> 2910.16
saying it right there you

2906.8 --> 2914.079
could have been there's no guarantee

2910.16 --> 2919.04
that that actually succeeds

2914.079 --> 2922.96
right i had some plans of my own

2919.04 --> 2922.96
it's not really working out so well

2923.68 --> 2926.72
no they might there might be a

2925.04 --> 2928.88
turnaround

2926.72 --> 2943.839
right the crypto situation it's not

2928.88 --> 2943.839
really working out as as i had hoped

2946.0 --> 2949.119
right just because you know something

2947.68 --> 2951.2799999999997
ahead of time and you

2949.119 --> 2952.8
can figure out how you could have done

2951.28 --> 2954.48
something doesn't mean that

2952.8 --> 2956.8
what you could have done would have

2954.48 --> 2957.68
actually worked there's no guarantee of

2956.8 --> 2961.04
that

2957.68 --> 2961.04
so aftermath

2962.559 --> 2966.3190000000004
you should contact him well

2967.68 --> 2971.2799999999997
yeah i heard that he does info get

2969.76 --> 2972.2400000000002
involved in that it is kind of

2971.28 --> 2974.7200000000003
interesting

2972.24 --> 2975.359
look as soon as i got like crypto to

2974.72 --> 2978.72
move

2975.359 --> 2981.839
around with to play with then yeah i

2978.72 --> 2985.839
look i might listen in

2981.839 --> 2985.839
or ask some advice about that

2985.92 --> 2991.92
sure i'll definitely use him to kind of

2989.76 --> 2999.8390000000004
get a better oversight over what's

2991.92 --> 2999.839
going on out there crypto wise

3004.8 --> 3009.119
but it did work i didn't act on his

3010.839 --> 3027.839
advice

3012.24 --> 3027.839
all right

3030.559 --> 3035.52
oh you shouldn't beat yourself up over

3032.8 --> 3038.4
the head with that

3035.52 --> 3040.96
just gotta stick with what you're doing

3038.4 --> 3044.0
right now

3040.96 --> 3044.559
and don't grieve over past options

3044.0 --> 3047.92
missed

3044.559 --> 3055.8390000000004
it's kind of pointless to do that

3047.92 --> 3055.839
just gonna be miserable over it

3094.839 --> 3097.839
um

3098.559 --> 3103.119
all right well here we go again look

3100.64 --> 3104.8799999999997
mark has my complete respect too

3103.119 --> 3107.359
i i don't know why you would think

3104.88 --> 3109.92
anything else right

3107.359 --> 3112.24
just because i say i don't really like

3109.92 --> 3115.44
his presentation format

3112.24 --> 3116.0
it gives me a headache that's not me

3115.44 --> 3118.8
saying oh

3116.0 --> 3120.64
mark is bad he's control opposition or

3118.8 --> 3123.6800000000003
blah blah he's there

3120.64 --> 3126.48
no i just say i don't like his format

3123.68 --> 3130.0789999999997
okay that's it he's a little bit

3126.48 --> 3130.079
scattered i don't like that

3132.16 --> 3134.72
that's it

3136.48 --> 3139.839
other than that he's great

3140.559 --> 3143.8390000000004
and have fond memories of bigger videos

3143.28 --> 3146.4
he made

3143.839 --> 3147.68
in the past so yeah there is no

3146.4 --> 3150.2400000000002
criticism stop

3147.68 --> 3151.7599999999998
being defensive i'm not attacking him

3150.24 --> 3167.839
i'm just getting real

3151.76 --> 3167.8390000000004
as i do with everybody everybody

3170.0 --> 3181.839
some peeps high energy some low

3183.2 --> 3186.3999999999996
i press pauses

3187.119 --> 3193.2000000000003
right well

3190.72 --> 3194.64
i don't really care that you don't like

3193.2 --> 3196.72
me calling it scattered

3194.64 --> 3199.1189999999997
because i'm calling it scattered and i

3196.72 --> 3200.5589999999997
explain exactly why and now it's your

3199.119 --> 3203.2000000000003
problem here we go again

3200.559 --> 3204.48
if you want to see seek out a fight

3203.2 --> 3206.24
again

3204.48 --> 3208.0
right if you if you gotta seek out a

3206.24 --> 3212.0789999999997
fight again

3208.0 --> 3212.079
i'm not going to adapt to that right

3212.559 --> 3218.6400000000003
let me be very clear what i said

3216.079 --> 3221.52
i said as a description i gave my

3218.64 --> 3223.92
reasons i'm not retracting that

3221.52 --> 3225.359
alright you gotta deal with that i'm not

3223.92 --> 3228.88
retracting it

3225.359 --> 3231.119
yeah i don't like his videos

3228.88 --> 3232.96
i think they're scattered he's not

3231.119 --> 3236.079
focused enough

3232.96 --> 3238.319
gives me a headache content is

3236.079 --> 3241.44
still good yeah you could put it on

3238.319 --> 3243.44
pause i don't put videos on pause

3241.44 --> 3245.599
i never do that that's not how i watch

3243.44 --> 3249.359
videos

3245.599 --> 3252.4
what i do is i turn it on then

3249.359 --> 3254.72
i start walking around thinking and

3252.4 --> 3257.119
worrying about what is being said

3254.72 --> 3260.48
perhaps deflecting my eyes to the screen

3257.119 --> 3264.48
if there is some important visual

3260.48 --> 3267.839
i don't put things on pause

3264.48 --> 3267.839
i don't have time for that

3274.72 --> 3280.48
now you're making it negative

3278.64 --> 3283.1189999999997
i'm just describing something that i

3280.48 --> 3283.119
didn't like

3283.28 --> 3289.44
and that's it you're now

3287.2 --> 3291.7599999999998
rolling out all these responses

3289.44 --> 3295.44
defensive responses

3291.76 --> 3297.92
towards an attack that is not being made

3295.44 --> 3300.4
yeah if you want to freaking worship the

3297.92 --> 3303.599
guy put him on a pedestal

3300.4 --> 3305.599
and let no blemish touch him well go

3303.599 --> 3310.4
ahead

3305.599 --> 3310.4
go ahead i'm not being part of that

3316.64 --> 3323.52
see seeking star wars gets it

3320.079 --> 3335.8390000000004
she's not being defensive about it

3323.52 --> 3335.839
thank you very much for that

3356.799 --> 3361.2
right i didn't know that seeking star

3359.599 --> 3363.6800000000003
water but

3361.2 --> 3365.52
yeah i typically like to avoid

3363.68 --> 3368.8799999999997
activities

3365.52 --> 3370.88
or activities influenced by stress

3368.88 --> 3372.88
levels that make you pull your hair out

3370.88 --> 3375.119
i'd like to keep it if you know what i

3372.88 --> 3378.559
mean

3375.119 --> 3379.2000000000003
right it's enough stress i don't need to

3378.559 --> 3382.4
present

3379.2 --> 3382.799
the pinnacle of [ __ ] upness and stress

3382.4 --> 3385.2000000000003
and

3382.799 --> 3387.28
pain in this world that some my people

3385.2 --> 3389.5989999999997
might touch on

3387.28 --> 3391.119
there's no need for this it's not what

3389.599 --> 3393.3590000000004
you learn from there's no

3391.119 --> 3396.079
need to get people's attention with that

3393.359 --> 3398.16
because they're not gonna listen anyway

3396.079 --> 3400.48
there's already stress around people are

3398.16 --> 3402.16
defensive against it if you present a

3400.48 --> 3405.28
pinnacle of stress

3402.16 --> 3408.3999999999996
or confrontation in some way people

3405.28 --> 3410.7200000000003
are going to avoid it

3408.4 --> 3411.44
or they're going to double down on it

3410.72 --> 3414.72
and say this

3411.44 --> 3414.7200000000003
is so super awesome

3417.76 --> 3423.28
and they're gonna totally fall for that

3421.04 --> 3424.96
because they want it they want the full

3423.28 --> 3427.44
pinnacle of stress you want the

3424.96 --> 3430.7200000000003
confrontation yes the entire world is

3427.44 --> 3432.88
maniacally [ __ ] up it is hell

3430.72 --> 3435.52
you just don't see it yet it's hell

3432.88 --> 3438.319
everything is hell it's all gonna die

3435.52 --> 3439.92
well if that's really where you want to

3438.319 --> 3443.359
be at frequency wise

3439.92 --> 3446.48
i wish you the best of luck i don't

3443.359 --> 3449.68
i like to get to a place where can i

3446.48 --> 3454.48
where i can actually just

3449.68 --> 3459.04
visualize having a life worth living

3454.48 --> 3463.68
right not pointing it not shoving this

3459.04 --> 3463.68
in his feet not him

3466.64 --> 3475.839
before you get defensive again right

3483.68 --> 3490.799
right clutch bear exactly there you go

3486.559 --> 3490.799
it's what i classify as hyperactive

3490.96 --> 3494.88
yeah well here we go again maybe you

3492.799 --> 3497.359
should just marry mark okay why did you

3494.88 --> 3499.44
send him a proposal

3497.359 --> 3503.839
if you love him so much and what he does

3499.44 --> 3503.839
and how he does it

3503.92 --> 3517.839
it's getting tiresome

3518.24 --> 3521.2
yeah laugh it up

3524.24 --> 3531.7599999999998
that was not a joke

3530.319 --> 3533.839
moving on the earth is flat as

3531.76 --> 3538.2400000000002
stationary indeed

3533.839 --> 3538.24
indeed it is unlike

3538.48 --> 3544.4
neuro earlier in chat who said that just

3541.76 --> 3546.6400000000003
because the sun coordinates in a

3544.4 --> 3547.92
presuppositional base triangulation

3546.64 --> 3551.2
attempt

3547.92 --> 3551.92
doesn't match the observations and then

3551.2 --> 3554.96
he draw

3551.92 --> 3556.64
drew that the earth being fled into

3554.96 --> 3559.2
doubt because

3556.64 --> 3561.44
his as yeah physical assumption

3559.2 --> 3563.2
physicality assumption bias about the

3561.44 --> 3567.599
sun

3563.2 --> 3572.48
was not being confirmed in the result

3567.599 --> 3574.6400000000003
wasn't that just special

3572.48 --> 3576.0
it would be okay if i was defending you

3574.64 --> 3586.4
like this

3576.0 --> 3589.44
no not really

3586.4 --> 3601.839
jealousy are you serious

3589.44 --> 3601.839
here we go do you need a timeout

3604.799 --> 3608.64
yeah oh come on why didn't you why

3607.119 --> 3610.48
didn't you freaking look at what you're

3608.64 --> 3611.04
doing for once in your life here we go

3610.48 --> 3614.2400000000002
again

3611.04 --> 3616.72
you're always getting carried away

3614.24 --> 3617.4399999999996
by this type of behavior every single

3616.72 --> 3620.5589999999997
time

3617.44 --> 3622.64
last time i got really sick of it

3620.559 --> 3624.2400000000002
and you got way out of control i'm not

3622.64 --> 3625.52
going there again

3624.24 --> 3628.8799999999997
all right if you're going to get like

3625.52 --> 3631.04
that again i am just going to ban you

3628.88 --> 3634.88
for a period until you get out of that

3631.04 --> 3634.88
again because i'm not gonna deal with it

3637.52 --> 3645.28
okay good see you later

3642.4 --> 3657.839
when you're a little less defensive when

3645.28 --> 3657.8390000000004
nobody's actually being attacked

3660.04 --> 3663.09
[Music]

3664.079 --> 3670.799
all right i'm not jealous

3667.68 --> 3674.0
i understand i'm not jealous

3670.799 --> 3676.24
very much not jealous

3674.0 --> 3677.04
not because i shouldn't be jealous it's

3676.24 --> 3680.319
because i'm not

3677.04 --> 3680.96
jealous because i got things i got

3680.319 --> 3684.0
things

3680.96 --> 3688.079
they don't i know i do i'm not

3684.0 --> 3689.44
jealous i understand i'm not jealous of

3688.079 --> 3692.6400000000003
crow

3689.44 --> 3696.2400000000002
i'm not jealous of nathan i'm jealous of

3692.64 --> 3698.799
qe i'm certainly not jealous of bob

3696.24 --> 3699.2799999999997
i'm not jealous of owen benjamin

3698.799 --> 3702.559
although

3699.28 --> 3705.3590000000004
sometimes i do get a little jealous

3702.559 --> 3705.3590000000004
but i do it

3705.68 --> 3712.3999999999996
because yeah he touches

3708.799 --> 3714.72
what i dream about sometimes

3712.4 --> 3714.7200000000003
you know

3715.76 --> 3720.3190000000004
and i don't know there's just this link

3718.559 --> 3721.92
it's personal

3720.319 --> 3726.079
so maybe i do let him get it a little

3721.92 --> 3729.92
bit to me

3726.079 --> 3729.92
but i'm not like proud of that

3731.52 --> 3736.64
i'm not jealous of people because i got

3733.76 --> 3739.2000000000003
something i got something unique

3736.64 --> 3740.0789999999997
and yeah in the face of everything else

3739.2 --> 3743.0389999999998
that is out there

3740.079 --> 3744.4
it might be very little it might be

3743.039 --> 3746.88
minuscule it might be

3744.4 --> 3749.92
insignificant it might not even stand

3746.88 --> 3752.48
out in the grand scheme of things

3749.92 --> 3754.16
but it is good what i do is good it's

3752.48 --> 3758.0
technically sound

3754.16 --> 3759.2799999999997
i consider it professional my cosmogeny

3758.0 --> 3762.4
skills

3759.28 --> 3765.599
and my explanation skills

3762.4 --> 3770.96
my physics related

3765.599 --> 3772.559
insights are very solid and reliable

3770.96 --> 3774.559
and they're developing and they're

3772.559 --> 3778.1600000000003
developing in good directions

3774.559 --> 3780.4
always i'm very proud of that

3778.16 --> 3783.0389999999998
right i don't need to be jealous of

3780.4 --> 3784.88
people that don't have that

3783.039 --> 3787.6800000000003
and i don't need to flounder it in their

3784.88 --> 3787.6800000000003
faces either

3787.76 --> 3797.8390000000004
right to kind of like justify why i'm

3790.64 --> 3797.839
dissatisfied with parts of my life

3808.839 --> 3811.839
ah

3812.24 --> 3815.2999999999997
[Music]

3821.68 --> 3824.96
right i am a bit jealous of david weiss

3823.92 --> 3827.44
though

3824.96 --> 3827.44
that's just

3828.319 --> 3831.52
i just can't help it

3836.079 --> 3853.8390000000004
now that's a joke david weiss is awesome

3857.2 --> 3864.24
is there no way to achieve those well

3861.2 --> 3867.839
i'm not a big guy never going to be a

3864.24 --> 3867.839
big guy

3870.64 --> 3878.0789999999997
no what he has i can never achieve

3874.079 --> 3881.2000000000003
that can't happen anymore i might get

3878.079 --> 3883.76
kids at some point but he has that's not

3881.2 --> 3883.7599999999998
gonna happen

3886.0 --> 3894.24
i i might have had the opportunity like

3889.599 --> 3898.4
20 years ago but my mindset was so

3894.24 --> 3902.0
obstructive my ego so powerful

3898.4 --> 3903.44
that my ego basically just didn't allow

3902.0 --> 3905.28
me to go there

3903.44 --> 3907.52
and i couldn't master it i couldn't tame

3905.28 --> 3911.2000000000003
it so it just didn't happen

3907.52 --> 3913.359
i blew my i blew my moment

3911.2 --> 3914.8799999999997
and i like that's one of the things that

3913.359 --> 3917.92
i like really

3914.88 --> 3920.319
really regret but

3917.92 --> 3921.359
it was complicated because of what i was

3920.319 --> 3925.119
being confronted with

3921.359 --> 3927.52
i was like being threatened

3925.119 --> 3927.52
okay

3934.16 --> 3939.44
is eric to dubai dad i don't know what

3936.64 --> 3951.52
are you what the [ __ ] is this

3939.44 --> 3953.76
shut up

3951.52 --> 3955.0389999999998
i had my first kid when i was 40 but i'm

3953.76 --> 3957.599
a dude right

3955.039 --> 3960.96
yeah because men can get kids when

3957.599 --> 3960.96
they're older i've seen it

3961.52 --> 3965.92
and i have youth in me that's gonna last

3964.88 --> 3968.319
a long time

3965.92 --> 3970.0
maybe until i get kids i don't know

3968.319 --> 3972.64
because the kids do kind of like pull

3970.0 --> 3972.64
that out of you

3974.0 --> 3981.52
but that's worth it

3979.2 --> 3984.0
right so i'm not giving up i'm not

3981.52 --> 3987.599
giving up on getting kids i'm just

3984.0 --> 3989.68
not really right there right now

3987.599 --> 3991.52
and just walking up to some random

3989.68 --> 3994.72
person

3991.52 --> 3994.72
just say oh let's do it

4003.92 --> 4009.039
now i pretty much set my mind on this

4006.559 --> 4011.8390000000004
situation

4009.039 --> 4012.559
that's happening right now the medical

4011.839 --> 4016.24
clamp down

4012.559 --> 4020.2400000000002
on the world like i can't do it

4016.24 --> 4023.0389999999998
in this it's just i can't

4020.24 --> 4023.0389999999998
i can't do it

4023.76 --> 4027.28

4082.799 --> 4090.0
price range everything is

4084.079 --> 4092.7200000000003
[ __ ] up expensive

4090.0 --> 4094.24
right so hey all i would have to do is

4092.72 --> 4097.3589999999995
completely throw

4094.24 --> 4098.159
all of this into the trash get some

4097.359 --> 4101.4400000000005

4111.92 --> 4116.4800000000005
me to wear masks and [ __ ] and i'm gonna

4114.159 --> 4118.239
have to resist it or walk away again

4116.48 --> 4121.04
then i'm gonna have to recycle that

4118.239 --> 4124.718999999999
[ __ ] process over and over again

4121.04 --> 4127.679

4132.239 --> 4135.678999999999
it's impossible i can't figure a way out

4134.799 --> 4138.239
to do that

4135.679 --> 4138.2390000000005
i can't

4139.839 --> 4143.12
i'm not gonna talk about freaking prices

but it has to be real it has to actually

4234.0 --> 4238.08
work

4234.64 --> 4241.4400000000005
and not be some freaking gambling risk

4238.08 --> 4242.159
where i will lose more if it doesn't

4241.44 --> 4244.639999999999
work out

4242.159 --> 4245.28
with some freaking 50 50 coin flip or

4339.04 --> 4343.84
really really pissing me off

4350.64 --> 4360.8
hello samson by the way

4357.199 --> 4362.799999999999
slow on moon buggy yeah i don't know man

4360.8 --> 4364.56
i'm not going to assume any of that

4362.8 --> 4366.96
i just know that every time he brings

4364.56 --> 4368.88
that up i feel like i'm being

4366.96 --> 4370.56
psychologically assaulted by a

4368.88 --> 4385.84
eugenicist

4370.56 --> 4385.84
alright just so you know

4430.88 --> 4434.0
hey matthew eastman

4434.32 --> 4441.84
in chat

4453.76 --> 4455.84
i

4495.04 --> 4501.28
so i got uh 40 more minutes to go

4503.12 --> 4507.5199999999995
anything you guys would like me to

4508.84 --> 4511.84
address

4520.96 --> 4524.96
how did i learn english and barely have

4523.36 --> 4529.12
an accent

4524.96 --> 4532.159
well i i just started very young

4529.12 --> 4534.239
like when i was six when i was six i was

4532.159 --> 4536.48
interested in english

4534.239 --> 4538.879999999999
why was i interested in english because

4536.48 --> 4540.799999999999
a lot of the tv was in english

4538.88 --> 4542.88
like the good stuff wasn't english the

4540.8 --> 4545.04
cartoons the good movies

4542.88 --> 4546.8
that i thought at the time were good

4545.04 --> 4549.28
were english and they had dutch

4546.8 --> 4551.52
subtitles and so i thought i'm gonna

4549.28 --> 4554.32
learn this

4551.52 --> 4556.2390000000005
this is the language of the future well

4554.32 --> 4561.12
it's the language of my future

4556.239 --> 4561.12
in ways and i'm using it a lot right now

4561.679 --> 4569.4400000000005
and i come from a family where language

4565.84 --> 4572.64
was held in high regard

4569.44 --> 4573.04
both dutch and english so i got a lot of

4572.64 --> 4575.92
like

4573.04 --> 4576.56
personal education from my parents with

4575.92 --> 4581.84
it

4576.56 --> 4581.84
throughout my youth

4585.52 --> 4592.84
as in we would spend significant amounts

4588.88 --> 4595.04
of time just talking about language

4592.84 --> 4599.679
etymology all that

4595.04 --> 4599.679
looking things up on the non-internet in

4606.84 --> 4609.84
books

4619.76 --> 4624.719
yeah as for how do you get rid of the

4621.52 --> 4628.080000000001
accent you just gotta train it

4624.719 --> 4628.08
you gotta figure out how

4628.4 --> 4631.759999999999
how does your verbal mechanism how does

4631.04 --> 4634.96
your jaw

4631.76 --> 4637.52
and everything how does it actually work

4634.96 --> 4638.56
where are the issues how do you correct

4637.52 --> 4640.64
that training

4638.56 --> 4642.8
training right some people they work out

4640.64 --> 4644.88
like every day and

4642.8 --> 4646.159000000001
do the supplements and they get all like

4644.88 --> 4649.28
bodybuilding and [ __ ]

4646.159 --> 4650.0
right well i did that with speech that's

4649.28 --> 4653.28
what i've been doing

4650.0 --> 4656.0
with speech almost my entire life

4653.28 --> 4656.5599999999995
being the blabber mouth guy always

4656.0 --> 4658.48
talking

4656.56 --> 4662.080000000001
always bringing up ideas even when

4658.48 --> 4664.879999999999
people are not wanting it

4662.08 --> 4666.159
talking talking talking talking

4664.88 --> 4668.96
perfecting speech

4666.159 --> 4672.96
perfecting expressing certain things

4668.96 --> 4672.96
researching interesting words

4673.04 --> 4679.84
all that also

4676.84 --> 4683.159000000001
copying like good

4679.84 --> 4685.84
things of other people and like of

4683.159 --> 4689.04
scenarios in movies

4685.84 --> 4690.0
like the tone of things matters it

4689.04 --> 4693.28
matters a lot

4690.0 --> 4696.56
and i learn a lot from just watching

4693.28 --> 4698.48
other people say things in good ways

4696.56 --> 4700.0
and like the intention that comes with

4698.48 --> 4702.239
it all the extra effects

4700.0 --> 4707.84
i learned about that i have a strong

4702.239 --> 4707.839999999999
intuition for this

4713.04 --> 4721.84
hello stallion 80 12 yeah doing fine

4723.6 --> 4728.08
getting some friction from chat today

4725.36 --> 4728.08
but that's fine

4729.12 --> 4735.84
i'm doing just great

4746.88 --> 4752.159000000001
huh okay that sucks matthew eastman

4752.719 --> 4757.04
get in trouble when speaking like how

4755.76 --> 4759.12
what kind of trouble

4757.04 --> 4760.08
like what you're not allowed to speak

4759.12 --> 4763.679
french

4760.08 --> 4766.0
that's weird or was it more about hey

4763.679 --> 4767.679
don't talk in a language we don't

4766.0 --> 4768.96
understand in our presence because

4767.679 --> 4771.1990000000005
that's something else

4768.96 --> 4771.199
right

4773.04 --> 4777.199
it's like french is your native language

4775.28 --> 4777.759999999999
and then you yeah you hang around in the

4777.199 --> 4780.799999999999
us

4777.76 --> 4782.400000000001
and then starting talking french with

4780.8 --> 4784.2390000000005
another french speaking person

4782.4 --> 4786.0
in a group that doesn't understand

4784.239 --> 4788.639999999999
french yeah they get kind of pissed off

4786.0 --> 4788.64
i get that

4789.04 --> 4796.56
but i mean you can still just

4792.96 --> 4796.56
speak french right

4802.84 --> 4805.84
weird

4816.4 --> 4819.839999999999
huh all right

4821.199 --> 4824.5599999999995
well i don't speak french

4825.12 --> 4829.599999999999
i do get the accent though i do have a

4828.4 --> 4832.5599999999995
feel

4829.6 --> 4834.400000000001
for it the same goes for spanish it's

4832.56 --> 4836.159000000001
just that the literal language

4834.4 --> 4838.0
i don't really get it i guess it's very

4836.159 --> 4841.28
similar to my understanding of

4838.0 --> 4842.719
programming computer programming like i

4841.28 --> 4846.08
totally get it

4842.719 --> 4850.719
i just can't do it myself it it's very

4846.08 --> 4853.12
tough but i understand how it works

4850.719 --> 4854.4800000000005
and even like the routines that come

4853.12 --> 4858.88
with programming

4854.48 --> 4858.879999999999
through exposure through other people

4859.52 --> 4863.84
and the same goes for me yeah with

4861.44 --> 4866.799999999999
language it's a lot of language that i

4863.84 --> 4868.8
i listen i listen to it i listen what

4866.8 --> 4874.88
makes it different

4868.8 --> 4877.679
what is distinct about it

4874.88 --> 4880.159000000001
doesn't mean that i actually know how to

4877.679 --> 4883.92
put the words together in a logical

4880.159 --> 4883.92
grammar based sentence and all that

4885.92 --> 4889.76
but there's still a lot to identify and

4888.0 --> 4893.52
pinpoint

4889.76 --> 4893.52
about all the languages out there

4898.639 --> 4905.04
french people from losing louisiana

4902.32 --> 4907.28
came from there is what i was taught

4905.04 --> 4907.28
what

4913.6 --> 4917.84
ah right study in 8012 yeah it can be a

4916.56 --> 4921.76
very beautiful language

4917.84 --> 4921.76
spanish can be amazing

4922.239 --> 4931.28
because like really classic spanish is

4925.04 --> 4934.4
pretty astounding

4931.28 --> 4937.84
has similar strengths to english and

4934.4 --> 4941.28
that's very telling too you know because

4937.84 --> 4944.88
it all comes back from

4941.28 --> 4948.48
or comes it's uh

4944.88 --> 4952.639
how do you explain this in

4948.48 --> 4956.839999999999
the colonial and empire days

4952.639 --> 4959.36
the language by an empire will be

4956.84 --> 4961.6
used and perfected

4959.36 --> 4963.199
to control to give it the maximum

4961.6 --> 4965.360000000001
charisma to impose

4963.199 --> 4966.879999999999
to have the authority and claim it all

4965.36 --> 4967.839999999999
these powers come from within the

4966.88 --> 4970.8
language

4967.84 --> 4972.88
english has massive potential for this

4970.8 --> 4975.679
but so does spanish

4972.88 --> 4977.84
you know yeah spanish can be like oh yes

4975.679 --> 4981.6
spanish people can be just slobs and

4977.84 --> 4983.4400000000005
everything just not very ambitious not

4981.6 --> 4985.84
very

4983.44 --> 4987.28
like sinful people right they can be

4985.84 --> 4990.32
that but if they're like

4987.28 --> 4994.159
really focused and they have like

4990.32 --> 4996.88
strong principles

4994.159 --> 5000.719
yeah they can wield their language

4996.88 --> 5004.4800000000005
really amazing it's like a music

5000.719 --> 5007.679
it has that potential and it was used

5004.48 --> 5015.839999999999
in the spanish days when they went out

5007.679 --> 5015.84
over the world

5025.12 --> 5028.239
huh well foul and buchanan english is

5027.36 --> 5031.04
not the only

5028.239 --> 5034.879999999999
colonizing language spanish was

5031.04 --> 5034.88
absolutely a colonizing language

5036.32 --> 5039.599999999999
i don't know if you know but they too

5038.88 --> 5042.96
like

5039.6 --> 5046.719
got a whole bunch of countries out there

5042.96 --> 5046.719
that were colonized by the spanish

5047.84 --> 5057.84
it's not just english don't blame

5050.159 --> 5057.839999999999
everything on england

5068.84 --> 5071.84
so

5096.84 --> 5099.84
so

5110.84 --> 5113.84
hmm

5114.48 --> 5119.919999999999
gaelic speaking communities really

5117.199 --> 5123.28
outside of

5119.92 --> 5123.28
outside of ireland

5125.84 --> 5141.84
scotland what

5143.76 --> 5150.159000000001
all right well scott is not scottish

5147.28 --> 5154.5599999999995
the scots are not exclusively gaelic

5150.159 --> 5157.839999999999
it's also ireland

5154.56 --> 5159.679
right literally

5157.84 --> 5164.0
it's presumed to be the origin of the

5159.679 --> 5167.52
language but yes scots have it too

5164.0 --> 5169.6
and indeed they were basically

5167.52 --> 5171.52
turned into indentured slaves and all

5169.6 --> 5173.360000000001
that

5171.52 --> 5183.360000000001
especially after the the scottish

5173.36 --> 5186.239
rebellion against the crown

5183.36 --> 5187.839999999999
when they were basically defeated was it

5186.239 --> 5191.839999999999
called again

5187.84 --> 5192.400000000001
the infamous battle where like scotland

5191.84 --> 5197.84
pretty much

5192.4 --> 5197.839999999999
fell to england

5208.84 --> 5211.84
huh

5213.44 --> 5218.638999999999
hey what kamikaze give or what

5221.84 --> 5225.84
patagonia where is that patagonia

5226.0 --> 5239.84
name sounds familiar but

5243.76 --> 5246.08
dude

5247.92 --> 5253.84
where is patagonia

5264.719 --> 5281.84
all right anyway be back two minutes

5360.99 --> 5364.0689999999995
[Music]

5376.84 --> 5379.84
so

5394.639 --> 5399.76
gaelic is one of the languages of the

5396.8 --> 5399.76
bible what

5401.199 --> 5407.839999999999
uh what

5409.679 --> 5414.719
i thought it was greek like what

5418.84 --> 5421.84
i'd

5427.28 --> 5430.8
right post tower of babel sure sure i'm

5430.0 --> 5433.199
i'm pretty sure

5430.8 --> 5434.0
gaelic was very old but what how does

5433.199 --> 5449.839999999999
that relate

5434.0 --> 5449.84
to language of the bible what

5460.84 --> 5463.84
so

5472.32 --> 5479.92
it was the language of eden oh really

5477.28 --> 5479.92
okay

5486.32 --> 5490.0
i don't think so not saying that it's

5489.679 --> 5492.4
not

5490.0 --> 5493.92
worthy enough to be the language of eden

5492.4 --> 5495.599999999999
or anything i'm just saying that i don't

5493.92 --> 5498.639
think there was any language

5495.6 --> 5505.84
before tower of babel

5498.639 --> 5505.84
i think it was just all telepathy

5520.56 --> 5525.120000000001
yeah right clutch bear that's yeah that

5522.56 --> 5527.679
was my question too

5525.12 --> 5527.679
it seems

5528.48 --> 5533.599999999999
a little bit of an exaggeration

5531.679 --> 5535.52
maybe he just really loves the language

5533.6 --> 5538.56
and then yeah you'll

5535.52 --> 5538.56
put it on anything

5542.159 --> 5546.799999999999
next you're gonna claim that jesus was

5544.8 --> 5547.52
actually gaelic too or something you

5546.8 --> 5551.12
know that

5547.52 --> 5551.120000000001
that's kind of what it feels like

5553.12 --> 5564.239
but it's all fine you know

5561.28 --> 5566.08
like the gaelic is definitely

5564.239 --> 5575.839999999999
underappreciated historically

5566.08 --> 5575.84
so i agree with that

5587.28 --> 5603.84
this is thanks for that iron fe

5590.56 --> 5603.84
that's that's just hilarious

5605.44 --> 5608.879999999999
all right and by the way that was just a

5607.92 --> 5612.32
mock-up

5608.88 --> 5615.04
remark so don't historically

5612.32 --> 5616.639
tie me to the claim that jesus is now

5615.04 --> 5618.719
gaelic to arwyn

5616.639 --> 5619.92
i never claimed that it was a joke

5618.719 --> 5622.639
remark

5619.92 --> 5625.04
okay even if it turns out it might

5622.639 --> 5625.52
actually be true or something is crazy

5625.04 --> 5631.84
like that

5625.52 --> 5631.84
whatever don't tie it to me yes

5674.08 --> 5680.159
hmm okay iron f

5677.92 --> 5680.159
well

5681.76 --> 5685.280000000001
but what

5685.76 --> 5688.4800000000005
what how

5689.04 --> 5692.56
i know i'm having trouble putting it

5691.28 --> 5696.96
into context

5692.56 --> 5696.96
like so if jesus was celtic

5697.199 --> 5703.839999999999
then how about maria was she celtic

5700.96 --> 5704.88
i would joseph like what happened there

5703.84 --> 5709.04
then

5704.88 --> 5713.119
i'm entertaining this little conspiracy

5709.04 --> 5717.04
theory nugget but it's

5713.119 --> 5717.04
i'm having weird putting that together

5717.28 --> 5721.04
yeah i'm having trouble putting that

5718.56 --> 5721.04
together

5723.44 --> 5726.839999999999
then if it turns out to be true i must

5725.76 --> 5730.719
claim it

5726.84 --> 5731.52
uh i'll just stick to esoterics thank

5730.719 --> 5734.4
you very much

5731.52 --> 5736.2390000000005
i'll i'll just go with the the meaning

5734.4 --> 5739.839999999999
the lessons

5736.239 --> 5744.0
right i'm not really interested

5739.84 --> 5746.32
in jesus christ's genetic heritage

5744.0 --> 5749.119
if you know what i mean because his

5746.32 --> 5749.119
genetics were

5750.639 --> 5757.1990000000005
wow it's

5753.92 --> 5759.84
not important the spirit

5757.199 --> 5771.839999999999
is what was important that was what

5759.84 --> 5771.84
jesus was all about

5776.8 --> 5780.08
all right iron if uh

5782.239 --> 5785.839999999999
i don't know man

5787.92 --> 5799.84
like i don't know

5802.96 --> 5806.88
uh seeking star wars that was a soccer

5804.96 --> 5809.84
count it it's just again

5806.88 --> 5809.84
some gay troll

5809.92 --> 5827.84
with the soccer count of his name it's

5811.92 --> 5827.84
not the real him

5829.119 --> 5837.36
uh what why are you

5833.84 --> 5841.84
writing god with three capital letters

5837.36 --> 5841.839999999999
better spell on the babylonians

5850.48 --> 5856.5599999999995
that's why they came up with hieroglyphs

5853.52 --> 5859.76
i don't think so i think hieroglyphs

5856.56 --> 5862.4800000000005
preceded verbal speech

5859.76 --> 5864.56
it's communicating and there's writing

5862.48 --> 5867.759999999999
because

5864.56 --> 5871.119000000001
right telepathy requires

5867.76 --> 5872.159000000001
a direct connection so you have to face

5871.119 --> 5874.159
the person

5872.159 --> 5875.759999999999
so if you can't face the person and you

5874.159 --> 5878.32
still want to communicate you're going

5875.76 --> 5883.04
to have to use some form of writing

5878.32 --> 5885.199
i think that writing preceded speech

5883.04 --> 5887.36
yeah now that's a claim that i'm willing

5885.199 --> 5890.96
to actually make

5887.36 --> 5894.08
and it is outrageous and extreme enough

5890.96 --> 5894.08
for the likes of me

5895.28 --> 5897.84
all right

5898.32 --> 5903.92
that's my claim i think writing preceded

5901.6 --> 5910.639
speech

5903.92 --> 5912.8
i said it

5910.639 --> 5914.32
right and that can also explain why

5912.8 --> 5917.52
hieroglyphs

5914.32 --> 5921.679
why all of it is so far away

5917.52 --> 5923.679
from the typical grammar based speech

5921.679 --> 5925.36
because the grammar based speech got

5923.679 --> 5928.88
developed afterward

5925.36 --> 5931.199
you can't verbally express hieroglyphs

5928.88 --> 5932.32
like that that's something visual that's

5931.199 --> 5935.919999999999
a

5932.32 --> 5939.84
right speech has to be verbal

5935.92 --> 5943.4400000000005
and then writing of speech

5939.84 --> 5947.119000000001
is basically developed after this speech

5943.44 --> 5948.5599999999995
in order to follow that format of

5947.119 --> 5952.159
communication

5948.56 --> 5955.76
when before there was telepathy

5952.159 --> 5957.36
there would be no form of communication

5955.76 --> 5961.04
like that there would be no

5957.36 --> 5962.88
verbal system it wasn't necessary there

5961.04 --> 5966.56
would just be hieroglyphs just

5962.88 --> 5967.28
depictions imagery as communication

5966.56 --> 5969.679
instead

5967.28 --> 5972.0
and the telepathy there would be no

5969.679 --> 5973.119
syntax there would be no verbal syntax

5972.0 --> 5981.84
that existed

5973.119 --> 5981.839999999999
because people didn't need to speak

5987.52 --> 5992.8
all right so that that is a claim that

5989.52 --> 5996.96
i'm willing to make i'm not gonna say

5992.8 --> 5997.84
oh jesus christ was this race or that

5996.96 --> 6000.719
race

5997.84 --> 6001.679
no i'm just going to say no no no no no

6000.719 --> 6004.96
people

6001.679 --> 6006.159
learned to write before they learn to

6004.96 --> 6010.719
speak

6006.159 --> 6010.719
that's my claim that's my arwanian claim

6016.08 --> 6022.639
yes aries 106 that's what i'm saying

6019.44 --> 6025.199
that's the order

6022.639 --> 6027.4400000000005
the order of development that's what i

6025.199 --> 6027.44
think

6030.96 --> 6038.56
so why do we have vocal cords well

6035.36 --> 6042.48
because audibility right

6038.56 --> 6044.8
telepathy is communication but

6042.48 --> 6046.48
we don't know over how fast the distance

6044.8 --> 6049.52
that actually works

6046.48 --> 6050.0
might be proximity it might be dependent

6049.52 --> 6053.280000000001
on

6050.0 --> 6057.04
seeing each other's eyes so sound

6053.28 --> 6061.679
over distance and singing

6057.04 --> 6061.679
tones influences like that

6062.84 --> 6065.84
music

6066.48 --> 6071.36
right by that standard one could say

6068.88 --> 6073.6
that music might have preceded speech as

6071.36 --> 6076.799999999999
well

6073.6 --> 6080.159000000001
was just singing and humming and not

6076.8 --> 6093.84
words being communicated through singing

6080.159 --> 6093.839999999999
at first

6114.96 --> 6120.88
right irene well look

6118.239 --> 6123.678999999999
here i go again i think that infants are

6120.88 --> 6123.679
telepathic

6124.48 --> 6129.759999999999
you know why i think that because i kind

6126.719 --> 6129.76
of experienced it

6132.719 --> 6136.4
so yeah i think that the ability might

6134.719 --> 6140.4800000000005
still be there

6136.4 --> 6144.4
or maybe it reawaken maybe at some point

6140.48 --> 6147.5199999999995
like the telepathy was literally

6144.4 --> 6149.44
the field was cut down what caused was

6147.52 --> 6153.0
cut off

6149.44 --> 6154.239
by by the babel tower now was that an

6153.0 --> 6157.119
electromagnetic

6154.239 --> 6158.959999999999
distortion that it's it peaked and it

6157.119 --> 6159.839999999999
distorted the field that made it

6158.96 --> 6163.66
possible

6159.84 --> 6165.119000000001
or whether god decreed a

6163.66 --> 6168.159
[Music]

6165.119 --> 6171.199
yeah that telepathy would be over

6168.159 --> 6174.839999999999
that speech would now be scattered that

6171.199 --> 6177.199
communication had to be reinvented

6174.84 --> 6179.360000000001
maybe

6177.199 --> 6180.96
and i've even suggested because this is

6179.36 --> 6182.0
not the first time i'm bringing this

6180.96 --> 6184.08
theory up okay

6182.0 --> 6187.52
this is one of my things that i think

6184.08 --> 6187.5199999999995
that happened in the far past

6187.84 --> 6194.159000000001
and who knows if it was indeed an

6190.96 --> 6196.56
energy field disruption that caused

6194.159 --> 6198.08
telepathy to no longer work and forced

6196.56 --> 6202.0
people to develop

6198.08 --> 6205.36
spoken languages then maybe

6202.0 --> 6207.76
that same field has over time as energy

6205.36 --> 6211.28
things typically do

6207.76 --> 6214.96
restored and so we're still tied

6211.28 --> 6218.32
to language when there is telepathy

6214.96 --> 6219.6
capability present for people to pick up

6218.32 --> 6222.639
on and they do

6219.6 --> 6225.119000000001
when they're born because that's the

6222.639 --> 6226.56
start mechanism that's what you started

6225.119 --> 6233.839999999999
with

6226.56 --> 6233.84
it's the original communication

6237.36 --> 6243.199
that's right aries 106. doesn't it

6240.4 --> 6244.08
it as soon as i figured that one out

6243.199 --> 6247.28
it's just like

6244.08 --> 6248.4
yeah it's a really nice what people are

6247.28 --> 6250.719
gonna respond

6248.4 --> 6251.839999999999
to me about that how they're gonna

6250.719 --> 6255.6
respond

6251.84 --> 6256.08
i made my mind up like nobody's gonna

6255.6 --> 6260.159000000001
bring

6256.08 --> 6262.4
a better concept put together

6260.159 --> 6264.4
that explains that scenario and the

6262.4 --> 6266.799999999999
biblical references nobody's going to

6264.4 --> 6269.44
put something better together than that

6266.8 --> 6269.84
my mind is pretty much made up about

6269.44 --> 6274.0
that

6269.84 --> 6277.6
that event went like that

6274.0 --> 6280.96
and yeah don't really care

6277.6 --> 6280.96
if people don't like it

6287.119 --> 6291.28
do i think the ark of the covenant was

6288.96 --> 6294.88
an electrical device

6291.28 --> 6297.599999999999
electrical well it wasn't electronics

6294.88 --> 6297.92
but yeah it might have had something to

6297.6 --> 6302.0
do

6297.92 --> 6305.36
with uh with radioactive material

6302.0 --> 6308.4
somehow and who knows it might have been

6305.36 --> 6311.04
an extra interesting influence on top

6308.4 --> 6311.599999999999
that would influence telepathy in some

6311.04 --> 6316.159
way so

6311.6 --> 6318.2390000000005
who knows maybe within telepathy there

6316.159 --> 6319.44
the ark of the covenant was kind of like

6318.239 --> 6322.718999999999
a gateway to

6319.44 --> 6323.839999999999
to something greater to the creator

6322.719 --> 6327.6
perhaps

6323.84 --> 6329.52
it's it's it's still very mystical

6327.6 --> 6332.8
so i don't know for sure there's been so

6329.52 --> 6332.8
many ideas about it

6336.239 --> 6341.36
but yeah i think it's kind of likely

6338.719 --> 6341.36
that it had

6341.6 --> 6350.320000000001
electrical or magnetic

6345.199 --> 6350.32
function as part of what the device was

6356.0 --> 6362.96
but it doesn't mean that the electric

6359.199 --> 6364.719
aspects was the thing that made it it

6362.96 --> 6366.4
the electrics might simply have been

6364.719 --> 6369.679
some kind of amplifier

6366.4 --> 6370.0
that makes it easier to tune in or for

6369.679 --> 6373.04
the

6370.0 --> 6374.8
other influence to to find a way through

6373.04 --> 6376.08
and manifest things through that

6374.8 --> 6380.4800000000005
electrical power

6376.08 --> 6380.48
who knows how it works i don't know

6383.36 --> 6388.48
but yes it's very mysterious device

6396.56 --> 6399.84
practice clothes the priest had to wear

6398.719 --> 6405.119
that's right

6399.84 --> 6407.360000000001
yeah and also have you heard about that

6405.119 --> 6409.92
it was said that if you approach the ark

6407.36 --> 6411.92
you would have to be pure you would

6409.92 --> 6415.119
you like you must be pure it's not a

6411.92 --> 6418.32
matter of discussion or trade

6415.119 --> 6420.799999999999
like if you were not pure then the

6418.32 --> 6421.84
influence of being in its presence would

6420.8 --> 6425.28
make the

6421.84 --> 6427.679
sin inside of you burn you up

6425.28 --> 6429.28
right well that might be explained

6427.679 --> 6433.04
through extremely

6429.28 --> 6435.92
enhanced psychosomatics right

6433.04 --> 6436.8
so that in the presence of it your

6435.92 --> 6439.1990000000005
spirit

6436.8 --> 6441.119000000001
may simply be enhanced so any kind of

6439.199 --> 6442.5599999999995
sin that is resting there in the

6441.119 --> 6445.839999999999
background will we brought

6442.56 --> 6449.4400000000005
forth amplified and

6445.84 --> 6451.1990000000005
yeah do damage if you had any

6449.44 --> 6457.839999999999
right that's one of the ways i

6451.199 --> 6457.839999999999
interpreted that

6458.32 --> 6465.04
the ark was stolen recently really

6461.84 --> 6468.56
where are you getting that from

6465.04 --> 6468.56
it was in ethiopia right

6469.04 --> 6474.56
who stole it where are you getting this

6472.48 --> 6476.5599999999995
from what's your evidence for that

6474.56 --> 6478.0
because now you're just seeding some

6476.56 --> 6480.8
wild wild

6478.0 --> 6485.84
wild conspiracy theory you better

6480.8 --> 6485.84
[ __ ] back that up buddy

6493.28 --> 6501.199
it wasn't even officially anywhere

6499.119 --> 6502.99
in the news oh right okay well then you

6501.199 --> 6506.219999999999
know it's absolute [ __ ]

6502.99 --> 6506.219999999999
[Music]

6506.32 --> 6513.84
in the news

6552.84 --> 6555.84
so

6566.84 --> 6569.84
wow

6572.639 --> 6578.2390000000005
right so yeah that sounds like complete

6575.199 --> 6580.4
[ __ ] conspiracy nonsense

6578.239 --> 6582.32
especially in some freaking mainstream

6580.4 --> 6585.679
news are you kidding me

6582.32 --> 6597.84
are you kidding me mainstream news

6585.679 --> 6597.84
and that's evidence now sheesh

6600.719 --> 6607.28
right so so here's a little detail

6604.56 --> 6608.320000000001
right let's get logical with that

6607.28 --> 6610.719
extreme

6608.32 --> 6612.96
conspiracy theory you just launched in

6610.719 --> 6612.96
there

6613.679 --> 6617.4400000000005
it's been stolen the priests have been

6616.159 --> 6620.48
killed okay

6617.44 --> 6624.08
so what's preventing people

6620.48 --> 6627.678999999999
from going in the freaking temple

6624.08 --> 6630.0
and filming it and actually just making

6627.679 --> 6632.8
a documentary about it

6630.0 --> 6632.8
completely

6633.76 --> 6640.8
if that just happened

6638.0 --> 6641.52
because before yeah you weren't allowed

6640.8 --> 6643.04
in

6641.52 --> 6644.639
like the priest would literally just

6643.04 --> 6647.44
tell you nope

6644.639 --> 6648.0
you can't come in you just can't only if

6647.44 --> 6650.08
you were

6648.0 --> 6652.32
born and trained as a priest to guard it

6650.08 --> 6654.96
can you go in

6652.32 --> 6655.759999999999
right so if that's dead that's no longer

6654.96 --> 6659.119
there

6655.76 --> 6663.92
yeah what's stopping you from getting

6659.119 --> 6663.92
in and just taking a look at the place

6665.679 --> 6671.52
so this all just sounds like more

6668.639 --> 6671.52
conspiracy

6678.84 --> 6681.84
panic

6693.76 --> 6698.400000000001
some hundred skills oh really did you

6696.159 --> 6703.04
see the bodies

6698.4 --> 6703.04
iron fe did you see the bodies

6707.599 --> 6723.84
and who the hell did that then

6733.84 --> 6737.84
number of media i dude

6742.0 --> 6745.36

6747.599 --> 6754.32

6750.96 --> 6756.719
do you have any sources

6754.32 --> 6765.84

7054.32 --> 7058.799999999999
[ __ ] evidence

7055.599 --> 7064.08
and figure it out instead of squirting

like a bunch of doomsayers idiots

7064.08 --> 7067.28
you're all idiots if you believe that

7097.679 --> 7102.719
didn't actually provide any evidence

7100.4 --> 7104.0
and then you've launched it right here

7102.719 --> 7107.44
in my chat

7104.0 --> 7111.04
like that's the truth did you [ __ ]

7107.44 --> 7111.04

hydrogen bomb blowing up

7197.04 --> 7201.36
entire europe or something right that's

7200.0 --> 7203.36
that's what that is

7201.36 --> 7205.5199999999995
it's like oh yeah you read somewhere

7203.36 --> 7208.4
that that's gonna happen or

7205.52 --> 7211.360000000001
you know just as an example which is

7208.4 --> 7214.5599999999995
ridiculous because they don't exist

7211.36 --> 7214.5599999999995
but come on

7218.96 --> 7227.84
if there is the freaking ark somewhere

7222.239 --> 7227.839999999999
you're gonna know

7230.719 --> 7233.119
god

7236.96 --> 7244.4
it's not the real arc but could be no

7240.4 --> 7246.4
no iron fe you don't know that

7244.4 --> 7248.638999999999
but you get it through your thick skull

7246.4 --> 7251.119
you don't know it

7248.639 --> 7253.1990000000005
yeah you read an article it did not

7251.119 --> 7256.48
present any evidence

7253.199 --> 7258.719
and you took it you shoved it right down

7256.48 --> 7258.718999999999
there

7262.56 --> 7266.56
and you shoved it in my chat and now i'm

7265.599 --> 7269.84
pissed off

7266.56 --> 7269.84
because you fell for it

7269.92 --> 7277.1990000000005
you just took some news article

7273.44 --> 7281.44
and just assumed this extremity

7277.199 --> 7283.839999999999
like this very very severe extremity

7281.44 --> 7283.839999999999
okay

7293.599 --> 7297.4400000000005
oh yeah battles and war are real sure

7295.679 --> 7311.84
they are

7297.44 --> 7311.839999999999
sure they are

7322.84 --> 7325.84
do

7336.8 --> 7342.88
great yeah thanks a lot now i'm gonna

7338.96 --> 7342.88
have this [ __ ] thing in my head

7342.96 --> 7347.28
thanks a lot man thanks a lot

7348.08 --> 7353.84
literally ruined my entire day now with

7350.4 --> 7353.839999999999
that [ __ ]

7374.96 --> 7382.159
dude if that if it was there

7378.719 --> 7382.8
if it was there yeah and it was stolen

7382.159 --> 7385.5199999999995
and it's now

7382.8 --> 7387.76
in the hands of the satanists then this

7385.52 --> 7392.159000000001
is going to be the last year

7387.76 --> 7394.719
do you understand [ __ ] is gonna blow up

7392.159 --> 7395.36
and you will not [ __ ] recognize this

7394.719 --> 7409.84
world back

7395.36 --> 7409.839999999999
after that happens right

7413.92 --> 7419.92
remember the stories out there about the

7417.04 --> 7422.159
molten buildings and all that like the

7419.92 --> 7425.76
the rock carved buildings that were all

7422.159 --> 7428.32
malted melted through giant electric

7425.76 --> 7431.4400000000005
storms presumably

7428.32 --> 7434.239
let me give you a hint as to where

7431.44 --> 7451.839999999999
that's coming from

7434.239 --> 7451.839999999999
what type of power does that

7454.32 --> 7465.36
can the unclean make use of the ark i

7457.44 --> 7468.48
don't know

7465.36 --> 7470.4
i don't know maybe they'll try to blow

7468.48 --> 7473.199
it up

7470.4 --> 7474.239
maybe that will just unleash the full

7473.199 --> 7476.96
power

7474.239 --> 7478.079
and just absolutely destroy everything

7476.96 --> 7493.84
who knows what the

7478.079 --> 7493.84
[ __ ] is going on with that yeah

7500.239 --> 7504.4
would have to first actually find it

7505.199 --> 7507.839999999999
good one

7511.679 --> 7516.0
right yeah well my [ __ ] day is ruined

7514.32 --> 7519.44
now thanks

7516.0 --> 7519.44
absolutely [ __ ]

7519.52 --> 7523.280000000001
because i don't know how to deal with

7521.199 --> 7526.239
this [ __ ] okay

7523.28 --> 7527.92
i don't know how to deal with what

7526.239 --> 7530.0
potentially could have happened if

7527.92 --> 7534.4
that's actually real

7530.0 --> 7549.84
i can't deal with that [ __ ]

7534.4 --> 7549.839999999999
it's too much

7557.119 --> 7563.598999999999
there's just terrible terrible things

7560.88 --> 7564.2390000000005
like even if they can't use it okay it's

7563.599 --> 7567.1990000000005
still

7564.239 --> 7567.598999999999
terrible because what could they do with

7567.199 --> 7570.638999999999
it

7567.599 --> 7573.84
well they could install it

7570.639 --> 7577.599
in the middle of a giant weapon

7573.84 --> 7578.96
platform base as like a blackmail tools

7577.599 --> 7580.32
like oh you want to blow this up well

7578.96 --> 7581.119
then you're going to blow up the ark of

7580.32 --> 7584.079
the covenant

7581.119 --> 7584.5599999999995
yeah they could do that [ __ ] there's too

7584.079 --> 7591.36
much

7584.56 --> 7593.4400000000005
[ __ ] too much [ __ ]

7591.36 --> 7595.36
so let's hope they didn't actually find

7593.44 --> 7605.839999999999
anything that would be a

7595.36 --> 7605.839999999999
just unbelievable disaster

7616.84 --> 7619.84
okay

7623.84 --> 7629.360000000001
i'm gonna round this show out there's

7625.76 --> 7629.360000000001
nowhere i can really go with this

7629.44 --> 7633.839999999999
and the flatter debate's already started

7631.119 --> 7636.719
anyway so thanks everyone for coming
