112.48 --> 117.78
[Music]

115.799 --> 120.0
I don't know what it is

117.78 --> 123.78
it's kind of a

120.0 --> 129.25900000000001
cloudy soup not really a gray soup but

123.78 --> 129.25900000000001
yeah still currently fully Cloud covered

132.84 --> 136.81900000000002
so it's kind of the same weather as

134.52 --> 136.81900000000002
yesterday

136.86 --> 140.06
the grayish

142.19 --> 145.46
[Music]

146.28 --> 153.86
right I hope the sun will come out

150.599 --> 153.85999999999999
of that soon

156.18 --> 159.78
because yeah it might just as well clear

158.459 --> 162.42000000000002
up

159.78 --> 164.7
in an hour or whatever

162.42 --> 167.23899999999998
happens constantly

164.7 --> 167.23899999999998
anyway

167.94 --> 173.42
hello that flat fellow first in chat

170.7 --> 173.42
good to see you

173.819 --> 182.11999999999998
how are you doing

176.22 --> 187.419
it is Thursday the 27th of October 2022.

182.12 --> 187.419
[Music]

193.44 --> 197.7
I'm a little wonky because went to bed

195.84 --> 200.12
just too late

197.7 --> 200.11999999999998
okay

200.459 --> 204.0
I'm gonna do something about that I just

203.04 --> 207.35999999999999
get

204.0 --> 210.379
so hyped up like after 12 o'clock it's

207.36 --> 210.37900000000002
getting kind of annoying

210.44 --> 215.22
to figure out how to just force myself

213.12 --> 217.64000000000001
to go to bed earlier because it's better

215.22 --> 217.64
for me

221.28 --> 228.62
I usually just hang up hang around

224.459 --> 228.62
playing video games and uh

229.14 --> 232.22
right but anyway

232.26 --> 236.57999999999998
yesterday's show was pretty cool

234.48 --> 240.319
it's very happy about it flatters debate

236.58 --> 240.31900000000002
Bates was also interesting

241.2 --> 244.39999999999998
a LSG

245.4 --> 250.26000000000002
right and just before the show I was

247.98 --> 253.26
actually watching

250.26 --> 256.5
Hugo talks

253.26 --> 258.959
had just uploaded 20 minutes before my

256.5 --> 261.479
show would start

258.959 --> 264.66
and it was like a 20 minute video so I

261.479 --> 265.56
thought like oh well that fits exactly

264.66 --> 267.72
right

265.56 --> 270.54
I'm just gonna watch that

267.72 --> 273.61
but it was really good

270.54 --> 275.58000000000004
like very personal very honest

273.61 --> 278.40000000000003
[Music]

275.58 --> 280.25899999999996
about well

278.4 --> 281.75899999999996
like

280.259 --> 284.759
spirit

281.759 --> 286.97900000000004
well yeah like what I deal with with my

284.759 --> 288.96000000000004
healers like things can overwhelm you

286.979 --> 292.139
and then it kind of possesses you you

288.96 --> 294.71999999999997
get tagged

292.139 --> 298.139
and he described somebody that just went

294.72 --> 301.8
through well a prime case of that like

298.139 --> 303.90000000000003
watching some serial killer details and

301.8 --> 306.419
like yeah that'll [Â __Â ] you up for sure

303.9 --> 309.919
and that it did with that person very

306.419 --> 309.919
very strongly and

311.18 --> 316.139
right it's just

313.86 --> 318.72
yeah

316.139 --> 320.58
so what part of the reason why I try to

318.72 --> 323.94000000000005
avoid certain subjects I was also

320.58 --> 328.5
watching Owen Benjamin from I think

323.94 --> 330.84
uh Tuesday or Monday I'm not sure

328.5 --> 332.699
but he's just ranting about pedophilia

330.84 --> 335.75899999999996
all of a sudden and I just noticed like

332.699 --> 339.41900000000004
I I can't watch this now

335.759 --> 342.12
it's like it's making me sick

339.419 --> 345.96
and then the Hugo talks popped up

342.12 --> 347.88
why like notification and that was

345.96 --> 350.78
exactly what I needed it's really funny

347.88 --> 350.78
how that worked out

350.82 --> 355.02
because I was watching on Benjamin

352.5 --> 357.18
before that but it was just getting

355.02 --> 359.479
a bit too heavy

357.18 --> 362.039
and gross

359.479 --> 367.02
still informative though anyway hello

362.039 --> 367.02
five roads good to see you bjcnet

367.139 --> 370.44
huh you're in

368.88 --> 372.56
pretty early

370.44 --> 372.56
thank you

373.74 --> 377.12
glad to see you all

378.6 --> 387.06
I have a unbroken Illuminati Castle here

383.94 --> 390.199
it's just not ready to eat that yet but

387.06 --> 390.199
I'm looking forward to it

394.38 --> 399.919
it's quite gone to bed earlier I would

396.78 --> 399.919
have eaten that earlier

400.139 --> 402.74
anyways

403.919 --> 406.919
foreign

418.1 --> 422.53900000000004
just need some fresh air for a second

457.259 --> 460.259
foreign

464.34 --> 467.06
right

467.099 --> 471.9
so anything happened

469.62 --> 475.099
out there that

471.9 --> 475.099
slipped my attention

475.44 --> 478.039
probably

483.0 --> 488.84
so if you guys want to bring anything up

485.88 --> 488.84
go right ahead

489.96 --> 492.79999999999995
uh

521.53 --> 524.74
[Music]

529.08 --> 533.76
anyway I just wanted to give a little

531.72 --> 537.0600000000001
shout out to Robert

533.76 --> 539.1
Guns of Navarone for leaving a really

537.06 --> 541.68
nice comment yesterday

539.1 --> 543.12
on my show I really appreciate that I

541.68 --> 546.5999999999999
mean

543.12 --> 549.6
I get mostly just troll comments so it

546.6 --> 551.76
then sees a really heartfelt great

549.6 --> 554.0400000000001
message like that it like that really

551.76 --> 556.4399999999999
boosts my morale I really appreciate it

554.04 --> 557.64
not saying you all have to do that or

556.44 --> 561.0600000000001
something but

557.64 --> 563.76
like when that happens it it's really

561.06 --> 565.38
like a little bright light

563.76 --> 568.58
in that moment

565.38 --> 568.58
so thank you very much

571.8 --> 576.9799999999999
right anyway uh yeah yesterday

583.88 --> 587.72
I lasted very long

588.18 --> 595.76
with another uh members only live stream

591.48 --> 595.76
Nathan seems to be doing that a lot now

596.72 --> 601.5600000000001
still it has a lot of issues with this

599.58 --> 603.5400000000001
system so

601.56 --> 605.5799999999999
it's just a period of technical

603.54 --> 608.279
difficulties and it's so it seems

605.58 --> 611.12
unfortunately for him

608.279 --> 611.12
uh

613.98 --> 622.14
yeah Jim Bob had a fun hangout was very

618.24 --> 623.82
interesting about Gematria or gay matria

622.14 --> 627.36
as he called the title

623.82 --> 630.72
I was there in chat a lot

627.36 --> 633.3000000000001
and it was interesting

630.72 --> 635.899
I had a guy on that was real fanatical

633.3 --> 635.899
about it

636.779 --> 641.64
and he was like well what it felt like

639.24 --> 644.339
to me is that that guy was like bowing

641.64 --> 646.1999999999999
but with Gematria and he laid down all

644.339 --> 649.1
these connections that were so

646.2 --> 651.6
outrageous

649.1 --> 654.14
outrageously far-reaching it was just

651.6 --> 654.14
hysterical

659.959 --> 667.16
yeah so Jim Bob's very entertaining and

664.2 --> 667.1600000000001
interesting as usual

667.62 --> 671.279
uh

669.9 --> 674.06
[Music]

671.279 --> 674.06
let's see

675.48 --> 681.12
I missed out on flat side stream usually

678.24 --> 684.019
flat side streams at the same time as

681.12 --> 684.019
Jim Bob and

686.519 --> 691.1
and Jim Bob's just really entertaining

688.8 --> 691.0999999999999
so

691.68 --> 697.6999999999999
all right oh yeah I watched a little

694.2 --> 697.7
video of Eric Dubai also

698.1 --> 704.88
it's really curious

701.339 --> 708.0600000000001
it's again his view of the tides and

704.88 --> 711.0
bringing these Whirlpool supposedly

708.06 --> 713.779
such an elaborate presentation

711.0 --> 713.779
in this case

714.36 --> 718.339
and does really make me think like

718.62 --> 724.399
with that many rep like there might be

721.2 --> 724.399
something there it's

727.68 --> 733.399
but it is a very different

730.279 --> 736.32
conception from what I've also seen

733.399 --> 738.42
which are the like the tide Maps right

736.32 --> 740.4590000000001
and then you get to see like the worldly

738.42 --> 743.2199999999999
things

740.459 --> 744.92
which indicates not like oh wow it's

743.22 --> 748.7
certainly like

744.92 --> 748.6999999999999
disappearing it's not like

749.0 --> 754.079
right that is kind of like what you

751.74 --> 756.1800000000001
would expect if it like gets all sucked

754.079 --> 759.38
up in a hole and then blows out again

756.18 --> 759.38
right so

759.48 --> 764.04
Eric Dubai's versioner yeah I call it

762.3 --> 766.38
Eric the base version because he has

764.04 --> 767.42
been the most predominant person to

766.38 --> 770.399
actually

767.42 --> 772.9799999999999
perpetuate that view

770.399 --> 775.44
while I've not seen other people do that

772.98 --> 777.9590000000001
right it was really every time Eric

775.44 --> 780.9590000000001
Dubai is the one drawing that in and it

777.959 --> 783.0
interesting but I'm not sure if it's

780.959 --> 786.7199999999999
true because

783.0 --> 788.7
like well the tides map just doesn't

786.72 --> 791.82
show that

788.7 --> 795.0600000000001
and instead I think that my

791.82 --> 797.279
very loose conception of what I call

795.06 --> 800.5189999999999
Angel spoons is actually much more

797.279 --> 803.3389999999999
viable at least that's pointing out

800.519 --> 806.339
like a real phenomenon whether yeah we

803.339 --> 808.0790000000001
can't really manipulate it or well maybe

806.339 --> 810.7790000000001
somebody can I don't know

808.079 --> 812.8199999999999
but that's at least like correlating

810.779 --> 815.9399999999999
with the data

812.82 --> 819.6600000000001
that we actually get

815.94 --> 821.82
available within our reach anyway

819.66 --> 823.519
I thought it was interesting

821.82 --> 828.139
[Music]

823.519 --> 828.139
yeah RV's Channel yep

828.3 --> 836.3599999999999
I did bring that up yesterday right

831.899 --> 836.36
YouTube went full RV on RV

839.36 --> 842.6
[Music]

850.139 --> 852.8
right

853.68 --> 859.62
anyway I I do despite everything and his

857.279 --> 863.42
influence I do wish him the best of luck

859.62 --> 863.42
of regaining his audience again

863.519 --> 868.44
maybe this is like an opportunity to try

866.1 --> 872.4200000000001
and do it in a new way since you're

868.44 --> 872.4200000000001
gonna have to reattract crowds right

873.06 --> 875.54
anyway

876.12 --> 878.839
huh

885.5 --> 891.769
good to see you

887.0 --> 891.769
[Music]

892.32 --> 896.0400000000001
it's always fun by the way bumping into

894.42 --> 898.5
you guys

896.04 --> 900.0
in chats and other channels

898.5 --> 901.98
I love that

900.0 --> 904.44
I mean I'm flattered debates you'd

901.98 --> 907.139
expect that right I'm a mod there and

904.44 --> 908.82
all but it's also fun like oh hey

907.139 --> 912.12
at Jim Bob's

908.82 --> 913.62
see many of you pop up

912.12 --> 916.62
it's always fun

913.62 --> 916.62
uh

926.88 --> 929.8389999999999
yay

931.16 --> 939.1999999999999
that's just what I wanted

934.35 --> 939.2
[Music]

944.6 --> 949.5600000000001
[Music]

946.62 --> 953.88
all right it's not really blue sky up

949.56 --> 956.5189999999999
there it's like this thin white Veil

953.88 --> 959.1
so it's like sort of Misty up there but

956.519 --> 962.16
not really enough to completely block

959.1 --> 963.6
out the sun weird but fine as long as

962.16 --> 965.0
there is any sun coming through I'm

963.6 --> 968.32
happy

965.0 --> 968.32
[Music]

968.519 --> 972.9590000000001
so then my webcam can do the contrast

971.04 --> 975.56
thingy again and make me look like I'm

972.959 --> 975.56
on Krypton

976.26 --> 978.92
oh

983.0 --> 989.979
[Music]

993.839 --> 996.9590000000001
right

995.1 --> 999.24
anyway that's uh

996.959 --> 1002.1389999999999
been a pretty quick summarization of

999.24 --> 1002.139
what's been going on

1005.46 --> 1008.639
[Music]

1009.079 --> 1013.04
Philadelphia Experiment

1014.0 --> 1017.92
yeah that's a really weird one

1019.3 --> 1025.0
I always find there's something

1021.32 --> 1025.0
unsettling about that whole thing

1025.699 --> 1030.38
wasn't there like a movie of a movie

1028.459 --> 1031.939
made about it

1030.38 --> 1034.16
where they did like a sort of

1031.939 --> 1035.199
dimensional thing and then people would

1034.16 --> 1037.0400000000002
like

1035.199 --> 1038.54
reappear

1037.04 --> 1039.9189999999999
like they would go to the other

1038.54 --> 1042.98
dimension and then when it would

1039.919 --> 1045.6200000000001
reappear like people were like sunk into

1042.98 --> 1048.819
the decks and all that like merged with

1045.62 --> 1048.819
it all [Â __Â ] up

1052.94 --> 1059.2
I have yeah I mean it is something like

1056.419 --> 1059.2
that possible

1060.62 --> 1066.9189999999999
it actually to me on an intuitive level

1063.32 --> 1070.82
and like knowing roughly

1066.919 --> 1073.7
what is potentially possible it seems to

1070.82 --> 1076.72
me more likely a that that actually

1073.7 --> 1079.4
happened compared to like some other

1076.72 --> 1081.919
Fantastical ideas

1079.4 --> 1083.299
that are going around

1081.919 --> 1086.96
I mean I think that the Philadelphia

1083.299 --> 1091.22
Experiment is probably more likely than

1086.96 --> 1093.919
say the uh the Hadron Collider

1091.22 --> 1095.84
opening up a portal to another dimension

1093.919 --> 1097.2800000000002
I think that it's more likely that a

1095.84 --> 1099.4399999999998
Philadelphia Experiment actually

1097.28 --> 1102.6789999999999
happened that they just messed with some

1099.44 --> 1106.299
really weird frequencies and

1102.679 --> 1106.299
Calamity ensued

1107.48 --> 1112.039
then that supposed hydron collider super

1110.419 --> 1114.5
hydro and collider actually does

1112.039 --> 1115.9
anything other than just turn on really

1114.5 --> 1117.98
big magnets

1115.9 --> 1120.74
[Music]

1117.98 --> 1122.72
sounds like old school sci-fi conspiracy

1120.74 --> 1124.64
yeah

1122.72 --> 1129.16
well where do you think old school

1124.64 --> 1129.16
sci-fi conspiracy ideas came from

1129.34 --> 1136.6999999999998
right it's the period I mean those are

1133.58 --> 1139.1
like Tesla days those are the days where

1136.7 --> 1141.98
there was a lot of experimenting going

1139.1 --> 1145.1599999999999
on with Electrics

1141.98 --> 1146.84
right because electricity was getting

1145.16 --> 1151.039
industrialized

1146.84 --> 1154.6999999999998
and freaky things happened like more

1151.039 --> 1158.299
than just one thing I mean

1154.7 --> 1160.4
really weird things so yeah of course

1158.299 --> 1164.0
that inspired a whole bunch of sci-fi

1160.4 --> 1165.8600000000001
conspiracy but who's to say that it

1164.0 --> 1168.26
didn't actually happen that they didn't

1165.86 --> 1169.52
try out something they just like took a

1168.26 --> 1172.039
ship and then

1169.52 --> 1175.039
put a device on it or projected it from

1172.039 --> 1177.3799999999999
the outside like this basically like a

1175.039 --> 1179.96
sort of Tesla death ray type thing but

1177.38 --> 1184.5800000000002
not to disintegrated but to like phase

1179.96 --> 1186.32
it out of its normal flux blend starting

1184.58 --> 1189.62
to techno Babble now

1186.32 --> 1191.4189999999999
and then like they didn't know what

1189.62 --> 1194.0
would happen

1191.419 --> 1196.039
and they just try or maybe Tesla did

1194.0 --> 1198.44
that like once with a couple of things

1196.039 --> 1200.299
and then the military was like

1198.44 --> 1203.8400000000001
hmm

1200.299 --> 1208.58
we're gonna try that out

1203.84 --> 1210.98
like just like that I mean yeah

1208.58 --> 1212.539
and then they just did that

1210.98 --> 1214.64
who knows

1212.539 --> 1216.86
I think it's more likely compared to

1214.64 --> 1217.88
some other ideas that are popular out

1216.86 --> 1219.9189999999999
there

1217.88 --> 1223.1000000000001
of what supposedly has happened in the

1219.919 --> 1223.1000000000001
world anyway

1223.53 --> 1226.589
[Music]

1227.559 --> 1233.36
teleportation phasing

1231.02 --> 1236.36
there's no such thing as teleportation

1233.36 --> 1239.6
teleportation is a very sloppy

1236.36 --> 1244.2199999999998
construct based on the idea that you can

1239.6 --> 1246.62
digitize physical reality itself

1244.22 --> 1249.28
and recreate it it's ridiculous but

1246.62 --> 1249.28
phasing

1249.32 --> 1252.3999999999999
something to it

1256.34 --> 1260.059
although I don't understand how that

1258.32 --> 1261.62
would actually work like with matter

1260.059 --> 1266.08
itself

1261.62 --> 1266.08
I mean the spirit can definitely face

1266.48 --> 1271.72
I don't know it's all pretty surreal

1269.419 --> 1271.72
stuff

1275.539 --> 1281.179
right but like maybe they tried like a

1277.94 --> 1283.4
stealth system right they phase it out

1281.179 --> 1285.0800000000002
and then yeah it's you can't pick it up

1283.4 --> 1287.179
already everything just goes through it

1285.08 --> 1289.22
you don't see it and then they phase

1287.179 --> 1291.5590000000002
back in for like a sneak attack or just

1289.22 --> 1293.72
to get past some blockade or whatever

1291.559 --> 1296.24
right I mean that seems like a pretty

1293.72 --> 1299.299
useful technology sort of a

1296.24 --> 1301.82
start tracking stealth

1299.299 --> 1304.46
right but yeah it might have had

1301.82 --> 1306.62
unexpected side effects

1304.46 --> 1308.9
you know and by the way there's been

1306.62 --> 1311.4799999999998
like Star Trek

1308.9 --> 1314.2
stuff with that too in later series I

1311.48 --> 1314.2
think Voyager

1315.62 --> 1319.6399999999999
where they would even somebody would

1317.539 --> 1321.74
secret military stealth technology

1319.64 --> 1325.1000000000001
forbidden but then also that you could

1321.74 --> 1328.4
like physically move through things ah

1325.1 --> 1332.1789999999999
ah in Star Trek I remember that anybody

1328.4 --> 1335.6200000000001
seen that episode like this

1332.179 --> 1335.6200000000001
special ship

1337.36 --> 1342.6789999999999
Voyager was it in a movie

1340.039 --> 1344.84
it might have been in one of like the

1342.679 --> 1347.72
Next Generation

1344.84 --> 1350.24
era Star Trek movies I don't remember

1347.72 --> 1352.1000000000001
exactly there's a lot of Star Trek but I

1350.24 --> 1353.419
distinctly remember that there was an

1352.1 --> 1356.799
episode

1353.419 --> 1356.7990000000002
or a movie like that

1356.84 --> 1364.299
where somebody was trying to collect

1359.96 --> 1366.74
a stealth test ship secret war machine

1364.299 --> 1368.96
that was illegal

1366.74 --> 1371.32
that was caught stuck in the middle of a

1368.96 --> 1371.32
meteor

1372.74 --> 1378.26
it phased back in right in the middle of

1375.86 --> 1380.84
it and they were

1378.26 --> 1382.46
yeah that was what the episode was about

1380.84 --> 1386.6589999999999
well it sounds a lot like the

1382.46 --> 1387.98
Philadelphia Experiment now doesn't it

1386.659 --> 1389.9
huh

1387.98 --> 1393.159
yes

1389.9 --> 1393.159
anybody remember that

1393.799 --> 1400.1
and yeah vibrating out it was the same

1397.4 --> 1402.14
things it was the same

1400.1 --> 1404.86
thing

1402.14 --> 1408.38
they basically did a Philadelphia

1404.86 --> 1411.02
Experiment integration into the Star

1408.38 --> 1413.5390000000002
Trek story as a

1411.02 --> 1416.72
a secret military weapon which is

1413.539 --> 1421.419
exactly what the Philadelphia Experiment

1416.72 --> 1421.419
supposedly was it's amazing

1423.86 --> 1427.82
ah you remember that PG Cena

1426.2 --> 1430.159
right

1427.82 --> 1433.1589999999999
so yeah Philadelphia Experiment I think

1430.159 --> 1435.0200000000002
it's very interesting freaky but

1433.159 --> 1436.4
interesting and potentially there's

1435.02 --> 1440.2
something to it

1436.4 --> 1440.2
but yeah dangerous

1442.76 --> 1449.15
hmm

1445.5 --> 1449.15
[Music]

1449.659 --> 1455.48
but who knows man I mean that thing was

1452.72 --> 1457.64
a long time ago right so let's just

1455.48 --> 1458.96
speculate might be a little scary

1457.64 --> 1461.48
actually

1458.96 --> 1462.799
so let's speculate sign science fiction

1461.48 --> 1466.039
wise

1462.799 --> 1469.58
but they've actually in secret continued

1466.039 --> 1472.82
these experiments and have perfected it

1469.58 --> 1475.22
so that people don't accidentally face

1472.82 --> 1476.48
in the middle of the deck of a ship

1475.22 --> 1478.82
right

1476.48 --> 1481.94
maybe they perfected it to level even

1478.82 --> 1485.0
where they could just make personal

1481.94 --> 1487.76
stealth devices but stealth devices that

1485.0 --> 1490.84
actually just make you able to walk

1487.76 --> 1490.84
through walls

1492.74 --> 1498.32
or like even through the floor

1495.5 --> 1501.5
like literally you could like phase out

1498.32 --> 1503.059
into ghost mode and just move through

1501.5 --> 1506.08
everything until you choose to

1503.059 --> 1509.72
re-materialize I mean that Tech might

1506.08 --> 1513.1
theoretically exist already

1509.72 --> 1513.1000000000001
pretty freaky right

1516.57 --> 1520.039
[Music]

1518.48 --> 1522.02
yeah

1520.039 --> 1525.26
but I mean that's going to be some

1522.02 --> 1527.72
seriously hidden stealth deck because

1525.26 --> 1531.14
if that sort of thing gets in the hands

1527.72 --> 1533.0
of like overly ambitious tyrannical

1531.14 --> 1535.64
figures or

1533.0 --> 1538.7
like military juntas that's like

1535.64 --> 1540.5590000000002
extremely dangerous because it just is

1538.7 --> 1543.0800000000002
so seductive all the power you could

1540.559 --> 1544.82
suddenly have but the risk of like

1543.08 --> 1548.72
opponents getting their hands on it is

1544.82 --> 1551.6589999999999
then equally terrible so

1548.72 --> 1552.6200000000001
but it might exist

1551.659 --> 1554.6200000000001
foreign

1552.62 --> 1558.6999999999998
[Music]

1554.62 --> 1558.6999999999998
over in my intro

1560.48 --> 1563.74
territory probably

1563.84 --> 1569.48
I mean

1565.7 --> 1571.94
it was crows versus magpies

1569.48 --> 1574.34
so it's probably just territorial I mean

1571.94 --> 1576.88
crows and magpies are not exactly fans

1574.34 --> 1576.8799999999999
of each other

1577.94 --> 1584.74
uh anyway all right bringing that up

1582.02 --> 1584.74
whatever

1585.559 --> 1587.74
foreign

1589.08 --> 1593.21
[Music]

1599.38 --> 1604.3590000000002
very funny

1601.21 --> 1604.359
[Music]

1635.08 --> 1639.58
all right any thoughts by the way on my

1638.12 --> 1642.9799999999998
uh

1639.58 --> 1644.539
gravity flares idea I mean it's

1642.98 --> 1647.98
ridiculous but I thought that was

1644.539 --> 1647.98
actually quite creative of myself

1650.179 --> 1653.779
I mean

1651.5 --> 1657.14
if if the

1653.779 --> 1659.9
space belief upholder tricksters

1657.14 --> 1663.679
constantly fumble like that then we have

1659.9 --> 1666.679
to as Believers be equally creative

1663.679 --> 1669.679
in our conceptions in order to meet

1666.679 --> 1669.679
justify

1669.86 --> 1676.84
and negate these seeming errors right

1681.74 --> 1687.82
and of course I'm also talking to akumo

1683.96 --> 1687.82
virus who knows all about that

1695.0 --> 1697.779
hmm

1704.299 --> 1709.82
so yeah that could be I mean if we're

1706.64 --> 1714.5590000000002
gonna go that far if we're gonna allow

1709.82 --> 1717.3799999999999
gravity flares to make pens drop

1714.559 --> 1719.48
certainly to the floor

1717.38 --> 1722.659
while people

1719.48 --> 1725.659
that hold it are still caught in zero g

1722.659 --> 1727.64
or apparent zero g right or that

1725.659 --> 1729.7990000000002
somebody floats while a

1727.64 --> 1732.0200000000002
a glass of water standing on the desk

1729.799 --> 1734.84
while there has to be an explanation for

1732.02 --> 1737.179
that and my explanation was a gravity

1734.84 --> 1740.6
flare temporary

1737.179 --> 1745.279
gravity Spike emanating from Earth to

1740.6 --> 1747.9189999999999
unusual Heights that would suddenly

1745.279 --> 1750.86
catch an object like that in its pool

1747.919 --> 1753.919
and just as if it is just on Earth

1750.86 --> 1756.3799999999999
right now indeed if like things like

1753.919 --> 1759.679
toys are suddenly phasing into reality

1756.38 --> 1762.22
in order for children to grab them then

1759.679 --> 1764.659
yeah maybe that is Philadelphia

1762.22 --> 1767.299
Experiment technology

1764.659 --> 1770.7990000000002
it's very risky if they'd actually just

1767.299 --> 1770.799
use that in plain sight

1773.72 --> 1779.779
but I guess

1776.6 --> 1782.4189999999999
testing in space you know

1779.779 --> 1785.24
I mean if you're gonna test like phasing

1782.419 --> 1787.7
things out and in reality

1785.24 --> 1790.58
it's better to probably do it in space

1787.7 --> 1793.82
because then the amount of things you

1790.58 --> 1796.22
could accidentally phase into will be

1793.82 --> 1798.6789999999999
less since it's mostly just vacuums it's

1796.22 --> 1800.419
easy escape hatch compared to on Earth

1798.679 --> 1803.659
where of course we're surrounded by

1800.419 --> 1806.44
materials and gas and water

1803.659 --> 1806.44
so

1806.48 --> 1810.3990000000001
yeah see that's how you do it

1814.34 --> 1819.799
I mean it's either that

1817.46 --> 1822.32
or it was all a lie and the Earth is

1819.799 --> 1825.22
flat so

1822.32 --> 1825.22
it's your choice

1838.52 --> 1841.179
hmm

1846.29 --> 1850.71
[Music]

1848.98 --> 1860.609
that was fun

1850.71 --> 1860.609
[Music]

1861.919 --> 1866.2
I hope you guys enjoyed that too

1877.1 --> 1882.58
I'm gonna start digging into this

1879.559 --> 1882.58
Illuminati Castle

1890.5 --> 1905.41
[Music]

1911.0 --> 1913.299
foreign

1938.36 --> 1942.6999999999998
I didn't know was coming through that

1940.34 --> 1942.6999999999998
loudly

1947.38 --> 1953.0800000000002
foreign

1949.24 --> 1953.08
yeah it is a really good

1976.1 --> 1982.9589999999998
hey Nathan Oakley 98. good to see you

1979.9 --> 1982.959
[Music]

1983.539 --> 1986.919
how's the computer today

1988.279 --> 1994.51
better I hope

1991.31 --> 1994.51
[Music]

1997.039 --> 2001.32
or I was mostly just gilded wasn't it

2005.799 --> 2011.08
yeah hopefully they restored the update

2008.5 --> 2014.25
because I think that Guild is just

2011.08 --> 2019.1499999999999
acting up because of some update

2014.25 --> 2019.15
[Music]

2027.5 --> 2030.69
[Music]

2055.419 --> 2058.02
oh

2060.04 --> 2065.619
okay Nathan

2061.78 --> 2068.3790000000004
but it was scratchy right

2065.619 --> 2070.7200000000003
so are you saying that the scratchiness

2068.379 --> 2074.919
of gilded was actually because of your

2070.72 --> 2077.7
system not because of killed itself

2074.919 --> 2077.7
hmm

2086.1 --> 2089.36
[Music]

2089.56 --> 2096.339
okay well glad to hear that Gilda didn't

2092.56 --> 2100.32
just go to [Â __Â ] overnight then because

2096.339 --> 2100.32
it seemed like a great system so

2100.42 --> 2105.4590000000003
um

2102.32 --> 2105.4590000000003
[Music]

2111.46 --> 2114.46
oh

2116.74 --> 2122.9799999999996
right voice meter banana

2119.26 --> 2125.5
well Nathan that's what you get when you

2122.98 --> 2128.44
surround yourself with Precision control

2125.5 --> 2131.14
dials it's like why is this not working

2128.44 --> 2135.2400000000002
why is this not working ah and it's like

2131.14 --> 2135.24
yeah because the one over there

2136.0 --> 2138.72
uh

2156.099 --> 2161.079
I'm not an idiot no I'm not saying

2158.74 --> 2163.2
you're an idiot at all I mean I like

2161.079 --> 2165.4
when there's like a lot of

2163.2 --> 2168.52
controls about something especially

2165.4 --> 2169.839
sound it gets really hectic

2168.52 --> 2173.28
I

2169.839 --> 2173.2799999999997
look you gotta realize

2173.619 --> 2179.26
my mother was a music professional

2176.8 --> 2181.9
including like sound recordings and all

2179.26 --> 2185.5200000000004
that she helped out with that too like

2181.9 --> 2189.04
her students like for decades

2185.52 --> 2191.38
so I've seen a couple of things as a kid

2189.04 --> 2193.7799999999997
and at a distance and just those

2191.38 --> 2196.54
freaking soundboards are so elaborate

2193.78 --> 2199.3590000000004
with all those dials and you really have

2196.54 --> 2202.359
to have a bit of a talent and a loving

2199.359 --> 2204.94
of doing it to just be able to

2202.359 --> 2206.92
master that and keep oversight over what

2204.94 --> 2210.099
everything is

2206.92 --> 2213.88
because it gets really hectic

2210.099 --> 2215.6800000000003
it's not easy like if you yeah if you

2213.88 --> 2219.3
just have like a couple of gauges it's

2215.68 --> 2222.5789999999997
very easy but if you have like 16 or

2219.3 --> 2224.7400000000002
64 yeah then suddenly things get just

2222.579 --> 2226.8590000000004
really hectic

2224.74 --> 2226.859
um

2229.54 --> 2235.74
okay

2232.0 --> 2235.74
okay if you say so Nathan

2239.02 --> 2241.619

2249.28 --> 2255.8390000000004

2251.859 --> 2255.839
eventually figure it out so that's great

2257.02 --> 2261.3
yeah no harm done right

2503.2 --> 2508.3199999999997

if they would actually consider like if

2510.76 --> 2515.079
some of these people

2512.079 --> 2517.3590000000004
that do the ISS trickery and might

2515.079 --> 2520.3590000000004
that they might actually at some point

2517.359 --> 2521.68
address these super weird

2520.359 --> 2525.04
sightings

2521.68 --> 2526.54
right I mean it's left in there it's not

2525.04 --> 2528.7599999999998
like

2526.54 --> 2531.16
they pretend it never happened

2528.76 --> 2533.0200000000004
they that sort of thing doesn't really

2531.16 --> 2534.3999999999996
have like if something goes wrong they

2533.02 --> 2536.14
just leave it and they don't draw

2534.4 --> 2538.6600000000003
attention to it right

2536.14 --> 2541.2999999999997
they don't like quickly erase it because

2538.66 --> 2542.92
they know the Streisand Effect and all

2541.3 --> 2544.96
that

2542.92 --> 2548.26
but I wonder if there's somebody in

2544.96 --> 2550.54
there would actually pick up on my idea

2548.26 --> 2552.76
of a gravity flare

2550.54 --> 2555.64
to when somebody asks something like

2552.76 --> 2558.2400000000002
that like how did that pen

2555.64 --> 2558.24
drop

2558.64 --> 2562.3799999999997
out of that astronaut's hand

2564.22 --> 2569.04
or was it

2565.96 --> 2572.32
wasn't it addressed

2569.04 --> 2573.7
or is this like my personal Mandela

2572.32 --> 2577.619
effect again

2573.7 --> 2577.6189999999997
did they ever address it

2577.72 --> 2583.3799999999997
was like an incident a whole while ago

little hard to tell

but it's an original

2636.819 --> 2642.96

2639.16 --> 2642.96
the glass of water was addressed

2644.28 --> 2650.1600000000003

2692.02 --> 2698.16
by the way just thinking about it

2695.319 --> 2701.5
to even have

2698.16 --> 2704.7999999999997
traditional glasses like a glass of

2701.5 --> 2709.2
water type of glass on the ISS

2704.8 --> 2709.2000000000003
is by itself kind of absurd

2713.04 --> 2719.5
I mean why would you have a traditional

2717.22 --> 2721.06
glass when you could never use that in

2719.5 --> 2722.859
there right

2721.06 --> 2725.02
I think they're the much more sensible

2722.859 --> 2728.0989999999997
way to basically

2725.02 --> 2728.099
consume water

2728.5 --> 2733.359
would be

2729.94 --> 2735.94
through like well sort of a syringe

2733.359 --> 2738.04
system where it's just a tube of water

2735.94 --> 2741.04
and you can just push it out and just

2738.04 --> 2744.42
drink it that way right and then you can

2741.04 --> 2744.42
float around nothing goes wrong

2745.24 --> 2749.68
and you have no issue because oh you

2747.88 --> 2751.54
can't use the

2749.68 --> 2753.7
gravity

2751.54 --> 2756.16
to make the water go down in your mouth

2753.7 --> 2757.5989999999997
out of a bottle all that right so a

2756.16 --> 2762.0989999999997
syringe system would be much more

2757.599 --> 2765.819
logical why did they even have a glass

2762.099 --> 2768.839
in space that's just ridiculous why

2765.819 --> 2768.839
would you even have that

2813.7 --> 2815.8799999999997
glass

2820.06 --> 2824.68
and perfectly still too it's not like it

2822.579 --> 2827.38
was like slightly wobbling around or

2824.68 --> 2831.359
something that the surface tension was

2827.38 --> 2831.359
keeping it in there whatever

2832.74 --> 2840.339
hydroscopy maybe it was a hydroscopic

2835.3 --> 2843.2200000000003

2840.339 --> 2845.74
what the hell does a glass of water

2843.22 --> 2847.359
sitting there perfectly still in the ISS

2845.74 --> 2850.359
have to do with

it seems to act exactly the same

they picked up the glass later

2971.02 --> 2974.8

2972.819 --> 2978.2799999999997
that makes sense

I mean the best they could have done the

2978.28 --> 2985.48
most hilarity that could have ensued

2981.46 --> 2988.359
is that that person like would have

have to do with anything

3031.38 --> 3037.02
that they use is not the scale and you

you can literally see the skill bar

3040.98 --> 3046.079
growing and shrinking and all that I

3044.339 --> 3048.66
mean after that point what does it

3046.079 --> 3051.619
matter when I think about the distances

3048.66 --> 3051.6189999999997

3132.839 --> 3139.4

3150.72 --> 3157.5589999999997

3154.68 --> 3159.72
can literally see the scale change I can

3157.559 --> 3162.3
literally see it shrinking

3159.72 --> 3163.41

oh that's funny

I'm gonna present this

3191.4 --> 3194.3

3202.619 --> 3210.7200000000003

there you go

in the right bottom corner you see it

3282.18 --> 3290.2799999999997
right 200 Mi and then that bar okay now

3286.559 --> 3293.76
let's see what happens we move a little

3290.28 --> 3297.96
laterally no scrolling oh oh did you see

3293.76 --> 3300.38
that it suddenly moved it moved just a

3297.96 --> 3300.38
little though

3308.52 --> 3313.8
but yeah what used to actually happen is

3311.76 --> 3319.26
that if you scroll

3313.8 --> 3322.44
north south then the oh whoa

3319.26 --> 3326.099
boom did you just see that

3322.44 --> 3329.3
yeah you know what that's called

3326.099 --> 3329.3
not the scale

3332.22 --> 3337.6189999999997
but it seems like they sort of changed

3335.46 --> 3340.559
the output of it see because now it

3337.619 --> 3342.96
doesn't just straight out stretch up and

3340.559 --> 3345.3
Shrink right away there's only little

3342.96 --> 3349.079
alterations but there is alterations

3345.3 --> 3352.619
which means it's actually not the scale

3349.079 --> 3353.7200000000003
this is not a euclidean projection oh

3352.619 --> 3358.1690000000003
there it goes

3353.72 --> 3358.169
[Music]

3360.359 --> 3364.0989999999997
and there it shrinks again

3364.859 --> 3369.66
real

3366.96 --> 3373.859
see that's what I mean

3369.66 --> 3377.24
not to scale

3373.859 --> 3377.24
hope you enjoyed that

3391.44 --> 3396.96
um this is because you were changing a

3393.96 --> 3399.7200000000003
letter dude oh yes yes yeah that's right

3396.96 --> 3403.46
I'm changing my

3399.72 --> 3403.4599999999996
alleged horizontal position

3406.38 --> 3408.6400000000003
yeah

3407.819 --> 3410.099
and then

3408.64 --> 3412.859
[Music]

3410.099 --> 3415.76
and then suddenly oh the scale is

3412.859 --> 3419.4
different so sadly the same distance has

3415.76 --> 3424.38
a different numerical value

3419.4 --> 3427.819
like in a euclidean measurement right

3424.38 --> 3427.819
it's different it's not the scale

3428.52 --> 3437.22
yeah that means it's not a euclidean

3433.2 --> 3438.8999999999996
real model in the sense that that is not

3437.22 --> 3441.4199999999996
actually the Earth

3438.9 --> 3443.64
it proves it proves this is merely

3441.42 --> 3446.64
another projection

3443.64 --> 3449.94
it's not literally like that because if

3446.64 --> 3452.2799999999997
it would be then you would not see the

3449.94 --> 3454.079
scale bar slide up and down as you

3452.28 --> 3457.079
scroll

3454.079 --> 3460.2000000000003
horizontally

3457.079 --> 3462.9
over that map

3460.2 --> 3465.359
so excited over a misunderstanding no no

3462.9 --> 3466.38
it's not a misunderstanding it means not

3465.359 --> 3469.5
to scale

3466.38 --> 3471.059
yeah I has no misunderstanding there not

3469.5 --> 3472.68
from my side

3471.059 --> 3476.46
just means

3472.68 --> 3479.7
that the Earth is not literally that

3476.46 --> 3482.339
Globe as is being projected

3479.7 --> 3486.359
because there's parts that are just not

3482.339 --> 3490.02
to scale compared to other parts and so

3486.359 --> 3492.119
it's just kind of like sort of made to

3490.02 --> 3494.099
fit on that ball

3492.119 --> 3497.6400000000003
but it isn't actually that ball because

3494.099 --> 3501.44
if it was it would all be perfectly to

3497.64 --> 3501.44
scale and it isn't

3503.7 --> 3507.839
it

3504.319 --> 3509.16
yeah yeah I know

3507.839 --> 3511.7999999999997
I know

3509.16 --> 3512.64
only north to south yeah I know you know

3511.8 --> 3514.92
why

3512.64 --> 3516.48
because it's not the scale

3514.92 --> 3520.7400000000002
right

3516.48 --> 3523.28
or would you like to dispute and say no

3520.74 --> 3526.7599999999998
no when it grew smarter

3523.28 --> 3530.1600000000003
it wasn't actually this morning

3526.76 --> 3532.38
because it's literally that bald

3530.16 --> 3536.5789999999997
right

3532.38 --> 3539.76
no no I'm afraid not I'm afraid what it

3536.579 --> 3542.48
means is that that ball projection is

3539.76 --> 3542.48
not scale

3556.079 --> 3561.9
thanks for reminding me by the way it

3558.66 --> 3563.5789999999997
was good to to do that test again

3561.9 --> 3565.079
you can do it yourself

3563.579 --> 3567.5
you know

3565.079 --> 3572.819
and find out

3567.5 --> 3574.82
the ball projection is not the scale

3572.819 --> 3577.879
it's very easy it's right there

3574.82 --> 3577.8790000000004
[Music]

3582.42 --> 3585.4990000000003
[Music]

3590.7 --> 3593.48
hmm

3605.099 --> 3609.0
yes only the lonely keep chanting that

3607.799 --> 3610.92
for me

3609.0 --> 3614.88
keep chanting it

3610.92 --> 3617.52
I mean that is my point

3614.88 --> 3619.6800000000003
that's exactly what you expect

3617.52 --> 3621.48
from a projection

3619.68 --> 3626.52
which means

3621.48 --> 3629.54
that the ball Earth map in Google Maps

3626.52 --> 3629.54
is a projection

3629.819 --> 3636.14
and not literally what you're looking at

3632.94 --> 3636.14
to scale

3641.46 --> 3647.96
I know

3643.859 --> 3647.96
can you put the screen back again why

3648.839 --> 3654.0789999999997
just scroll back in the video or do it

3651.839 --> 3654.0789999999997
yourself

3656.76 --> 3663.6600000000003
to where do literatures get that gets a

3660.54 --> 3667.2599999999998
[Â __Â ] dude who gives a [Â __Â ]

3663.66 --> 3670.2
what you're gonna whine about oh with

3667.26 --> 3673.26
your information your thingies no no how

3670.2 --> 3678.72
about we just focus on the fact

3673.26 --> 3681.48
that your beloved Google Earth maps ball

3678.72 --> 3683.0989999999997
is not scale

3681.48 --> 3685.68
so that what you're looking at right

3683.099 --> 3688.619
there and using your maps with and all

3685.68 --> 3691.319
that is not actually a literal

3688.619 --> 3694.2000000000003
representation of a well

3691.319 --> 3696.359
ball Earth that you're standing on

3694.2 --> 3698.819
because it's not the scale

3696.359 --> 3700.98
so that's not the that's not the ball

3698.819 --> 3703.2
Earth you're standing on just for the

3700.98 --> 3705.7400000000002
record because it's not the scale so it

3703.2 --> 3705.74
can't be that

3706.38 --> 3711.559
yeah

3708.839 --> 3711.5589999999997
that's all

3714.58 --> 3721.179
[Music]

3723.299 --> 3725.96
hmm

3734.94 --> 3739.02
it's so

3737.579 --> 3742.88
simple

3739.02 --> 3742.88
being a flatter so sometimes

3743.16 --> 3745.5789999999997
I mean

3749.04 --> 3756.799
all I have to do is just point at

3751.859 --> 3756.799
the facts in the in your face facts of

3756.9 --> 3764.2400000000002
the things that you use and believe in

3761.16 --> 3764.24
is that simple

right

3802.94 --> 3807.9

3805.44 --> 3809.819
so is anybody else still there or are

3807.9 --> 3811.98
you just gonna let all the Ballers snow

3809.819 --> 3814.94
under the chat

3811.98 --> 3814.94
what's going on here

3822.48 --> 3826.04
are you not entertained

3827.46 --> 3830.2400000000002
foreign

3837.9 --> 3844.27
Google Earth Pro okay

3840.9 --> 3846.0
I don't really need to do that

3844.27 --> 3850.4
[Music]

3846.0 --> 3850.4
I sleep with one eye open geoshifter

3856.44 --> 3859.44

3877.319 --> 3879.92
yeah

3880.02 --> 3886.52
that's super cute The Only the Lonely

3884.04 --> 3889.38
Only the Lonely I mean come on

3886.52 --> 3891.839
are you actually saying that that you're

3889.38 --> 3895.02
making a case

3891.839 --> 3897.96
you're is this your attempt to justify

3895.02 --> 3900.96
why it's not the scale

3897.96 --> 3904.5
you do realize that you're allegedly

3900.96 --> 3906.96
looking at the ball right you zoom out

3904.5 --> 3910.2
and then you see that whole ball you

3906.96 --> 3912.2400000000002
zoom in and then you go to more details

3910.2 --> 3913.6189999999997
right that's the ball you're looking at

3912.24 --> 3916.14
right

3913.619 --> 3920.1600000000003
helping me a little thank you thank you

3916.14 --> 3923.7
for helping me learn

3920.16 --> 3926.66
about why your ball map representation

3923.7 --> 3926.66
is not the scale

3930.48 --> 3933.26
yes

3934.5 --> 3940.22
no it's not the scale

3937.26 --> 3940.2200000000003
oh wow

3946.619 --> 3951.9
I think we gotta

3948.42 --> 3955.46
numpty [Â __Â ] alert

3951.9 --> 3955.46
derpcon 4.

3973.36 --> 3978.469

3979.079 --> 3984.52
yeah you guys are hilarious hilariously

3982.26 --> 3988.8590000000004
stupid

3984.52 --> 3991.38
[Music]

3988.859 --> 3995.24
I mean I don't really have to do or say

3991.38 --> 3995.2400000000002
anything I can just let you

3995.339 --> 4000.099
creatively dig that grave for yourself

4000.319 --> 4006.339
if you're convinced that there's a good

4002.299 --> 4006.339
reason for what we just witnessed

4016.52 --> 4027.229
yes

4017.8 --> 4027.2290000000003
[Music]

4054.74 --> 4057.7
ah

4055.91 --> 4060.0699999999997
[Music]

4057.7 --> 4063.98
it's been explained

4060.07 --> 4067.52
[Music]

4063.98 --> 4069.619
I know I just explained it it's not the

4067.52 --> 4072.14
scale so what you're looking at right

4069.619 --> 4075.52
there is not a literal representation of

4072.14 --> 4075.52
the place you're standing on

4076.22 --> 4081.14
it's a very simple explanation it's also

4078.799 --> 4083.119
very irrefutable

4081.14 --> 4087.92
but you can think that you could refute

4083.119 --> 4090.44
it and just try to justify reasons to

4087.92 --> 4091.94
pull away from the fact that you're

4090.44 --> 4094.52
looking at a

4091.94 --> 4097.64
what's supposed to be literal

4094.52 --> 4098.7789999999995
representation of a ball Earth you're

4097.64 --> 4101.4800000000005
standing on

4098.779 --> 4105.259
but when you actually then look at the

4101.48 --> 4107.299
scale well that ball is not the scale

4105.259 --> 4110.48
we can only conclude that the Earth

4107.299 --> 4112.4
whatever it is is not that ball

4110.48 --> 4114.08
because that ball is not the scale and

4112.4 --> 4116.96
when something is not the scale that

4114.08 --> 4122.0199999999995
means that that's not it then

4116.96 --> 4122.02
so yeah it has been explained I know

4126.84 --> 4137.719
[Music]

4134.42 --> 4140.839
so when you ask a really annoyingly

4137.719 --> 4142.719
stupid straw man question that doesn't

4140.839 --> 4146.239
address anything that I'm talking about

4142.719 --> 4149.14
do will you get banned for it

4146.239 --> 4149.139999999999
Earth is live

4154.16 --> 4156.759
huh

4156.92 --> 4162.08
will you

4159.02 --> 4164.120000000001
will stupid straw man questions in

4162.08 --> 4166.4
response to everything I just said get

4164.12 --> 4170.08
you banned

4166.4 --> 4170.08
that's my new question

4174.63 --> 4183.289
[Music]

4186.799 --> 4191.299
yeah I think it's it's a yes

4189.5 --> 4194.12
I think you can get the [Â __Â ] out of here

4191.299 --> 4195.26
you goddamn [Â __Â ]

4194.12 --> 4199.16
yeah

4195.26 --> 4201.1990000000005
keep your lying in your face part to

4199.16 --> 4205.42
yourself

4201.199 --> 4205.419999999999
don't want people like that in my chat

thanks to kumu virus thanks for

4239.239 --> 4244.48
before yeah

4241.159 --> 4246.92
confirming everything I just said

4244.48 --> 4249.739
that's okay

4246.92 --> 4252.92
we wouldn't expect to be

4249.739 --> 4256.5199999999995
to have the earth ball representation

4252.92 --> 4259.159
beat the scale nobody said that the ball

4256.52 --> 4260.96
Earth is to scale I mean come on it's

4259.159 --> 4264.259999999999
been explained

4260.96 --> 4267.08
right are you saying that the distance

4264.26 --> 4269.320000000001
on the map is not the distance in the

4267.08 --> 4269.32
map

4269.9 --> 4274.4
no it has nothing to do with it it has

4272.6 --> 4276.64
to do with is that what you're looking

4274.4 --> 4279.849999999999
at is not the scale

4276.64 --> 4279.85
[Music]

4280.159 --> 4284.839999999999
I think I have a title

4282.56 --> 4289.3

4330.219 --> 4333.82
I'm sure he is

4334.46 --> 4339.25
take some more shots bro

4337.76 --> 4341.780000000001
do it

4339.25 --> 4345.08
[Music]

4341.78 --> 4348.62
just get the [Â __Â ] out of my chat I don't

4345.08 --> 4352.64
want disgusting lying to your face straw

4348.62 --> 4356.0599999999995
Manning scumbags in my chat

4352.64 --> 4358.04
I'd rather have weirdo excuse makers

4356.06 --> 4359.42
like a kumu virus

4358.04 --> 4362.0
telling me

4359.42 --> 4364.34
how correct I am but that that

4362.0 --> 4366.86
supposedly doesn't matter I mean at

4364.34 --> 4369.679
least he's confirming that I am correct

4366.86 --> 4371.299999999999
right now the implications of it he can

4369.679 --> 4373.46
keep fuzzy in his head I'm fine with

4371.3 --> 4376.88
that I mean he's choosing to be a [Â __Â ]

4373.46 --> 4379.04
so yeah be a [Â __Â ] but at least he's

4376.88 --> 4381.4400000000005
not trying to straw man me with

4379.04 --> 4382.88
something that obviously has no

4381.44 --> 4387.219
consequence

4382.88 --> 4387.219
or relation to what I was talking about

4387.32 --> 4389.86
uh

4402.739 --> 4407.78
making a 2d map yeah but

4405.8 --> 4410.06
what

4407.78 --> 4412.58
but I thought that

4410.06 --> 4416.5
Google Maps

4412.58 --> 4416.5
was a globe

4418.34 --> 4425.12
sorry you're saying that Google Maps is

4421.34 --> 4427.46
actually a flat map projection

4425.12 --> 4430.699
it's a really weird thing to say when

4427.46 --> 4433.34
yeah you can well zoom out and see that

4430.699 --> 4435.44
that's a globe

4433.34 --> 4439.360000000001
what are you talking about a kumu virus

4435.44 --> 4439.36

you look there suddenly that is that

swamping my chat isn't it

5623.26 --> 5626.46
I don't know what it is

5650.739 --> 5656.0199999999995
remember when I first started doing that

5653.02 --> 5658.6
just keeping Ballers around in chat you

5656.02 --> 5663.280000000001
guys were protesting so hard

5658.6 --> 5665.92
like oh no not them ah

5663.28 --> 5667.96
because everybody was like oh a baller

5665.92 --> 5670.3
kick him out

5667.96 --> 5672.58

5670.3 --> 5674.5
of make it into a sport to just try to

5672.58 --> 5676.3
get in your face so they only got more

5676.3 --> 5678.54
better

5679.62 --> 5685.42

5682.42 --> 5688.659
you guys are just get agitated

5685.42 --> 5690.34
with these numpties or well not

5688.659 --> 5692.0199999999995
necessarily all of them but when they

5690.34 --> 5695.1990000000005
start acting like numpty's and then

5692.02 --> 5697.96
you're just in the chat like ah I get it

5695.199 --> 5699.759999999999
you don't really maybe that halts the

5697.96 --> 5701.7390000000005

5699.76 --> 5704.9800000000005

5704.98 --> 5710.138999999999
into another subject

5707.739 --> 5712.12

5710.139 --> 5713.26
away from the subject because you're

5712.12 --> 5715.599999999999
actually

5713.26 --> 5717.52

5715.6 --> 5719.139

5717.52 --> 5722.5
you're not invested and you want to

5719.139 --> 5724.659000000001
bring up something completely different

5722.5 --> 5726.58

5724.659 --> 5729.04
that's not an issue I'm not going to

hold that against you

5729.04 --> 5732.82
right

5730.36 --> 5734.98
that only applies and holding it against

5732.82 --> 5737.94

5750.94 --> 5755.379999999999
a challenge the challenge is really more

5753.76 --> 5760.12
of our patience

5755.38 --> 5763.86
because baller challenges are inept it's

5760.12 --> 5763.86
more challenges to their themselves

we we win the argument then you keep on

5767.679 --> 5771.639

5769.719 --> 5772.6
away with nonsense have nothing to do

5771.639 --> 5775.06

5772.6 --> 5777.639

5775.06 --> 5780.219
just agitating

5777.639 --> 5782.1990000000005
there is no rebutting to that because

5780.219 --> 5785.139
it's a red herring the whole thing is a

5782.199 --> 5787.178999999999
red herring usually

5785.139 --> 5790.0
and that's why they then stop commenting

5787.179 --> 5792.159
it's not because we don't want to debate

5790.0 --> 5796.56
about things it's because we already

5792.159 --> 5796.5599999999995

5851.44 --> 5859.299999999999
come up with nonsense excuses to justify

5855.34 --> 5862.54
why it is the way it is which does not

5859.3 --> 5864.52
comport with the ball Earth

5862.54 --> 5866.0199999999995
that's what you end up doing and that's

5864.52 --> 5868.6
just annoying

5866.02 --> 5872.7390000000005
it's not not actually bringing forth an

5868.6 --> 5876.120000000001
argument it's just scurrying away

5872.739 --> 5876.12
muddying the waters

5879.24 --> 5890.04
[Music]

5907.3 --> 5909.4800000000005
thank you

5939.3 --> 5943.2390000000005
right I come over I know you actually do

5942.1 --> 5946.659000000001
that

5943.239 --> 5948.159
with the weird akumu double thinking

5946.659 --> 5949.9
topping of

5948.159 --> 5951.5199999999995
oh yeah yeah no you're right you're

5949.9 --> 5954.82
right it is not the scale that's

5951.52 --> 5957.1
perfectly normal that's how it always is

5954.82 --> 5959.08
that's what you do then nakumu fires I

5957.1 --> 5961.780000000001
know that's fine I mean

5959.08 --> 5965.32
it's crazy but at least you're not just

5961.78 --> 5967.84
no new and making up ridiculous excuses

5965.32 --> 5972.04
and getting angry or something right

5967.84 --> 5974.9800000000005
so you got that going for you at least

5972.04 --> 5977.219
but you do end up saying the weirdest of

5974.98 --> 5977.218999999999
[Â __Â ]

5983.38 --> 5987.400000000001
to just fact check tell you what you're

5986.08 --> 5989.139
reading yes

5987.4 --> 5992.32
I know you do

5989.139 --> 5993.4800000000005
but then you don't seem to be making a

5992.32 --> 5995.679
logical

5993.48 --> 5998.98
Connections in your mind and

5995.679 --> 6002.52
Consciousness as to the consequences of

5998.98 --> 6004.5
that fact checking

6002.52 --> 6009.06
which is a good thing that you do that

6004.5 --> 6012.48
right but yeah then you still don't let

6009.06 --> 6014.580000000001
the information actually convince you so

6012.48 --> 6016.799999999999
you know

6014.58 --> 6018.96
that's fine that's your way of doing it

6016.8 --> 6021.62
it's better than the most of them out

6018.96 --> 6021.62
there so

6021.82 --> 6033.92
[Music]

6029.94 --> 6033.919999999999
oh God there's the other one

6042.179 --> 6048.0
this

6045.0 --> 6048.0
oh

6056.699 --> 6063.08
looks like Professor Phil Bell woke up

6058.86 --> 6063.08
woke up with a particular mood today

6081.06 --> 6083.54
happy

6086.639 --> 6088.82
birthday

6099.719 --> 6104.82
this is freaking hilarious

6103.26 --> 6108.54
foreign

6104.82 --> 6110.28
yeah so just because it's Professor Phil

6108.54 --> 6112.92
I'll go through it again because he

6110.28 --> 6115.38
obviously just jumped in

6112.92 --> 6118.38
right even though I've practically done

6115.38 --> 6119.9400000000005
the entire show about this subject half

6118.38 --> 6121.26
of it at least

6119.94 --> 6123.419999999999
yeah

6121.26 --> 6126.3
it's very cute that he knows oh it's

6123.42 --> 6129.9
because it's distorted it's like a flat

6126.3 --> 6133.34
map based on a globe and yeah but the

6129.9 --> 6136.619
thing is you know Google Earth

6133.34 --> 6138.96
Google Maps

6136.619 --> 6143.82
don't they like

6138.96 --> 6146.34
show it to you on a globe

6143.82 --> 6148.5599999999995
right I mean they have the flat map

6146.34 --> 6150.659000000001
projection option

6148.56 --> 6154.56
but they show it to you on the globe so

6150.659 --> 6156.239
if they use a globe to represent

6154.56 --> 6158.76
that map

6156.239 --> 6162.54
well isn't that what the Mercator map

6158.76 --> 6165.96
was based upon upon the globe and then

6162.54 --> 6170.639
it's basically put back into a globe

6165.96 --> 6173.699
wouldn't that undo the distortion

6170.639 --> 6176.639
then that was caused because it was made

6173.699 --> 6179.5199999999995
Flat from a globe supposedly

6176.639 --> 6183.06
it would wouldn't it it would undo the

6179.52 --> 6185.580000000001
Distortion but yeah when you go to

6183.06 --> 6188.0
Google Maps

6185.58 --> 6191.88
you scroll around

6188.0 --> 6194.04
horizontally over that Globe then the

6191.88 --> 6198.06
scales change

6194.04 --> 6201.36
so that doesn't really explain then

6198.06 --> 6204.360000000001
if the map it is based on what's based

6201.36 --> 6206.159
on the globe and then projected onto a

6204.36 --> 6208.259999999999
globe there should be no Distortion then

6206.159 --> 6211.5599999999995
if it was based off a globe

6208.26 --> 6214.139
but there is because it's not the scale

6211.56 --> 6216.5
when you move over it Professor Phil

6214.139 --> 6216.5
Bell

6220.26 --> 6224.2390000000005
there's no Distortion of oh

6225.179 --> 6228.659
oh

6226.159 --> 6231.599999999999
look at that

6228.659 --> 6234.719
yeah except there is and I literally

6231.6 --> 6235.679
demonstrated hear it here live on my

6234.719 --> 6238.86
screen

6235.679 --> 6240.3
for us to feel well I did it it is

6238.86 --> 6244.86
actually

6240.3 --> 6248.400000000001
yeah the scale changes as you note zoom

6244.86 --> 6252.5
in or out but move over that globe map

6248.4 --> 6252.5
all over oh look skill bar

6252.619 --> 6259.5599999999995
yeah it does change

6255.78 --> 6261.0
which means that this particular Globe

6259.56 --> 6264.26
projection

6261.0 --> 6264.26
is not the scale

6277.35 --> 6280.679
[Music]

6280.8 --> 6286.5
as expected

6283.219 --> 6288.659
yes you expect that your Globe model is

6286.5 --> 6290.46
not skill I know that I know that you're

6288.659 --> 6292.86
expecting that by now because every time

6290.46 --> 6294.42
you actually inquire the data it turns

6292.86 --> 6297.78
out that that's the case isn't it that

6294.42 --> 6299.58
that globe map you use is not scale and

6297.78 --> 6302.58
you know so you've come to expect it of

6299.58 --> 6306.8
course the glove is not the scale

6302.58 --> 6306.8
but what does that mean though

6308.28 --> 6312.96
what does that mean it's not the scale I

6311.4 --> 6314.94
mean you're used to it it's not scale

6312.96 --> 6318.9
it's like yeah of course we expect it

6314.94 --> 6322.159
but what does it mean

6318.9 --> 6322.159
if it's not the scale

6322.199 --> 6327.719
well what would it mean right what does

6324.659 --> 6330.0
that mean it means that well on one part

6327.719 --> 6332.46
of the globe

6330.0 --> 6334.92
a distance certain numerical value

6332.46 --> 6337.38
distance is this big

6334.92 --> 6342.06
right it's this big and then on the

6337.38 --> 6344.639
other side it's that big like smaller so

6342.06 --> 6346.860000000001
there's more there that that means it

6344.639 --> 6350.04
well that means that what you're looking

6346.86 --> 6351.96
at is not a literal representation

6350.04 --> 6354.84
it's not a literal representation

6351.96 --> 6357.659
because oh this part is bigger than that

6354.84 --> 6360.0
part even though it's crammed onto the

6357.659 --> 6361.86
globe like that so there's one part

6360.0 --> 6364.739
that's just

6361.86 --> 6367.86
bigger

6364.739 --> 6371.5199999999995
in relation to another part that's shown

6367.86 --> 6374.159
just as big but yet that is how it's

6371.52 --> 6375.96
shown on the globe model

6374.159 --> 6378.659
it's not to scale

6375.96 --> 6381.9800000000005
well the conclusion would be is that

6378.659 --> 6387.0
you're not looking at a representation

6381.98 --> 6389.82
of a literal euclidean situation or in

6387.0 --> 6391.739
other words it's not that globe that

6389.82 --> 6394.98
globe that you get to see

6391.739 --> 6397.5
is not what the Earth is

6394.98 --> 6400.879999999999
because it's not the scale

6397.5 --> 6400.88
that's what that means

6417.3 --> 6422.1
using Google Maps as proof proof for

6420.179 --> 6424.32
what

6422.1 --> 6428.219
I'm not claiming the Earth is a globe

6424.32 --> 6430.08
I'm just using the widely known and used

6428.219 --> 6433.32
Google Maps

6430.08 --> 6435.78
which is suggested to be based on a

6433.32 --> 6439.139
globe and represented as a globe

6435.78 --> 6440.759999999999
I'm just scrutinizing it and revealing

6439.139 --> 6441.719
like hey there doesn't seem to be the

6440.76 --> 6443.6990000000005
scale

6441.719 --> 6447.3
that might be a problem if you want to

6443.699 --> 6450.0
claim that this is the literal thing

6447.3 --> 6451.38
that is as is

6450.0 --> 6453.119
well it's not

6451.38 --> 6456.0
because if it would be then it would be

6453.119 --> 6458.159
the scale and it isn't yeah

6456.0 --> 6460.32
it's not really my claim that the Earth

6458.159 --> 6462.0599999999995
is that Globe I'm just pointing out a

6460.32 --> 6463.5
little factoid you know it's like oh

6462.06 --> 6465.360000000001
yeah that thing that you think is real

6463.5 --> 6470.04
well

6465.36 --> 6472.199
it's not that because it's not the scale

6470.04 --> 6474.239
it's up to you what you want to do with

6472.199 --> 6476.28
it you know it's not my claim it's not

6474.239 --> 6478.44
my problem I don't really care

6476.28 --> 6479.759999999999
what the globe birth is supposed to look

6478.44 --> 6481.739
like

6479.76 --> 6483.84
I just know that this thing that's used

6481.739 --> 6485.04
is not the scale so it's not the real

6483.84 --> 6487.82
thing then

6485.04 --> 6487.82
that is all

6494.29 --> 6499.579
[Music]

6510.9 --> 6513.9
foreign

6524.639 --> 6529.8
yeah it is not the real thing thank you

6527.34 --> 6531.900000000001
only the lonely I know it's not that

6529.8 --> 6535.139
it's not that's not the glow

6531.9 --> 6539.5199999999995
the thing you keep looking at you know

6535.139 --> 6541.619
to allegedly get photos off from Spurs

6539.52 --> 6544.76
yeah that well

6541.619 --> 6544.759999999999
it's not the real thing

6546.36 --> 6551.219
photos you get to see and all that well

6549.06 --> 6552.6
the way it's laid out

6551.219 --> 6555.78
that's

6552.6 --> 6557.6990000000005
like made to look exactly like how we

6555.78 --> 6558.96
see the maps isn't it

6557.699 --> 6562.5599999999995
except

6558.96 --> 6564.78
well those maps are not the scale

6562.56 --> 6566.639
so that's actually not what it really

6564.78 --> 6568.619
should be looking like

6566.639 --> 6573.54
because if you're looking at something

6568.619 --> 6577.38
real then it should all be on one scale

6573.54 --> 6579.96
it should all be exactly the same scale

6577.38 --> 6583.38
everywhere because it's real you know

6579.96 --> 6586.44
two scale is a projection it's it's

6583.38 --> 6588.54
something that's unique to map

6586.44 --> 6591.659
projecting

6588.54 --> 6594.42
right in a map you can make a huge

6591.659 --> 6596.699
continent into a little tiny Island and

6594.42 --> 6599.6990000000005
a very tiny Island into a huge continent

6596.699 --> 6601.619
you can do that with map projecting so

6599.699 --> 6603.54
how are you with cartography it's a very

6601.619 --> 6605.88
unique ability

6603.54 --> 6607.86
the thing is however that's for map

6605.88 --> 6610.32
making only it's for how the map is

6607.86 --> 6612.239
representing what is real you get

6610.32 --> 6613.98
scaling

6612.239 --> 6615.9
why that even is I don't even know

6613.98 --> 6617.4
because I'm not really

6615.9 --> 6620.82
a cartographer

6617.4 --> 6621.9
yeah but I'd roughly know what's going

6620.82 --> 6623.88
on there

6621.9 --> 6626.54
but what I do know is that in the real

6623.88 --> 6629.400000000001
world the scale

6626.54 --> 6632.699
is not relevant because in the real

6629.4 --> 6634.138999999999
world things is what it is it's as big

6632.699 --> 6637.919999999999
as it is

6634.139 --> 6640.32
it's located where it is

6637.92 --> 6643.56
Etc there's no to scale there's no skill

6640.32 --> 6645.78
differences everything is as is right so

6643.56 --> 6649.619000000001
if you're going to have a photo of the

6645.78 --> 6652.8
really is the real world it's gonna be

6649.619 --> 6654.48
all the same scale it would have to be

6652.8 --> 6656.88
if it wasn't

6654.48 --> 6657.919999999999
well then there is visual trickery going

6656.88 --> 6660.4800000000005
on

6657.92 --> 6661.5
photoshopping perhaps because they had

6660.48 --> 6663.959999999999
to

6661.5 --> 6665.94
you know

6663.96 --> 6667.7390000000005
but really that wasn't just the point

6665.94 --> 6669.739
for today and I think it's material

6667.739 --> 6672.959999999999
enough to

6669.739 --> 6674.699
sends the Ballers going spiraling and

6672.96 --> 6676.199
spiraling into their own Milky Way

6674.699 --> 6678.96
galaxy

6676.199 --> 6682.0199999999995
right but I am gonna run out the show

6678.96 --> 6684.36
it's been fun so thanks everyone for

6710.34 --> 6716.159000000001
I'm doing okay for now but

6713.34 --> 6718.139
yeah not through the winter just yet

6716.159 --> 6719.82
anyway

6718.139 --> 6723.32
I'll be back tomorrow with flat Earth

6719.82 --> 6726.179
early bird number 1405.

6723.32 --> 6728.4
on a Friday and I'm gonna join the Flat

6726.179 --> 6729.659
Earth debates over at Nathan Oakley 1980

6728.4 --> 6733.58
Channel

6729.659 --> 6733.58
which should start up any second now

6733.98 --> 6738.239
or any minute

6735.54 --> 6744.719
I hope to see you there in chat

6738.239 --> 6746.12
and until the next video keep it flat
