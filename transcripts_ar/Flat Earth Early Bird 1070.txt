whether today is

hazy again

116.96 --> 120.32
a lot more than yesterday

120.719 --> 123.67999999999999
and

121.92 --> 129.079
noticing also that

123.68 --> 129.079
it seems like most of the trees that

129.28 --> 134.56
had their leaves the color and falling

132.72 --> 139.12
seems like most of them have kind of

134.56 --> 142.0
like fallen somewhere in the last day

139.12 --> 143.76
like that tree over there

142.0 --> 146.08
which had all the

143.76 --> 149.28
nice red

146.08 --> 151.59900000000002
and orange leaves completely dropped

149.28 --> 156.599
all the leaves and

151.599 --> 156.599
most of the trees over there and there

158.239 --> 161.519
still trees out there that just have

160.0 --> 164.08
their leaves i don't think i don't know

161.519 --> 166.31900000000002
if they're even gonna drop them but

164.08 --> 170.44000000000003
the ones that seem to be doing that

166.319 --> 170.44
have dropped most of them

172.959 --> 175.959
right

184.879 --> 190.07999999999998
hello adam meekin first in chat good to

188.08 --> 196.20000000000002
see you

190.08 --> 196.20000000000002
it is sunday the 14th of november 2021

204.64 --> 207.27999999999997
let's see

205.76 --> 210.76
yeah yesterday

207.28 --> 210.76
plenty of streams

212.72 --> 216.959
it wasn't made by jim bob's and that was

215.44 --> 218.799
interesting

216.959 --> 221.12
sure yeah he does like short streams

218.799 --> 223.59900000000002
with it interesting i throw out

221.12 --> 226.59900000000002
a whole bunch of reflections on ideas

223.599 --> 226.599
and

226.879 --> 230.879
but i really love hanging around his

228.48 --> 233.51899999999998
streams also because yeah he does just

230.879 --> 233.51899999999998
address me

233.76 --> 239.12
and that's yeah i really appreciate that

236.239 --> 242.159
and that kind of motivates me

239.12 --> 244.4
to do what i do in chat

242.159 --> 244.4
uh

244.799 --> 251.20000000000002
also

246.64 --> 251.2
oh yes i've watched jaron's

252.4 --> 258.88
presentation from 2019

256.4 --> 262.63899999999995
it was interesting like watching back

258.88 --> 264.88
jaron from that time how he arranged

262.639 --> 267.04
things and arguments because it is

264.88 --> 268.639
slightly different

267.04 --> 273.36
because like

268.639 --> 275.04
he refined himself a lot since then

273.36 --> 278.40000000000003
but still like watching back the old

275.04 --> 278.40000000000003
ones it's pretty good stuff

278.639 --> 283.28000000000003
uh

280.479 --> 285.84
right also martin litke flatter day

283.28 --> 285.84
night live

286.08 --> 289.44
i hung around over there

289.68 --> 291.919
uh

294.639 --> 297.84000000000003
what else

301.12 --> 306.72
oh yeah quantum of conscious video

303.919 --> 308.0
which was really interesting this one

306.72 --> 310.639
he's like

308.0 --> 311.919
bringing out all his charts of

310.639 --> 315.199
consciousness

311.919 --> 317.52
and how that works and

315.199 --> 317.52000000000004
yeah

318.0 --> 323.6
it was yeah you'd have to watch it but

321.759 --> 325.91900000000004
a lot of what i deal with and even my

323.6 --> 327.03900000000004
esoterics and my descriptions of what

325.919 --> 330.15999999999997
it's like

327.039 --> 335.639
from ignorance to inside and

330.16 --> 335.639
long-term cycles yeah i resonate a lot

338.56 --> 345.039
although yeah you had some like

341.44 --> 345.039
philosophical idea about

345.919 --> 349.28
how basically everything is the swamp

348.24 --> 350.84000000000003
like

349.28 --> 353.44
everything is

350.84 --> 356.08
distractions and you you basically don't

353.44 --> 357.68
really like he

356.08 --> 360.639
put forth the idea you don't really have

357.68 --> 362.639
a choice like you have to dip into the

360.639 --> 367.08
swamp like

362.639 --> 367.08
like as a part of nature almost

367.28 --> 370.79999999999995
that certainly made me think

371.759 --> 377.039
because yeah he might have a point it's

373.759 --> 378.16
just not a very convenient point

377.039 --> 382.15999999999997
anyway

378.16 --> 384.0
ah low stone monkey that flat fellow

382.16 --> 385.44

384.0 --> 388.639

every day

451.84 --> 457.35999999999996

499.0 --> 502.269
[Music]

514.08 --> 516.479
what the

517.839 --> 521.839
all right i had no idea dude

523.12 --> 527.92
yeah but i see now there you got plenty

525.04 --> 527.92
of videos there

528.48 --> 531.48
what

535.68 --> 540.3199999999999
you do

537.68 --> 540.3199999999999
costumes

541.44 --> 545.7600000000001

uh get dude i'll take a look i'm

547.519 --> 553.839
subscribing but i'll take a look

550.72 --> 556.08
i'll put a link out for his channel

553.839 --> 560.6800000000001
since he doesn't have a wrench

556.08 --> 560.6800000000001
so here's that flat fellow's channel

565.6 --> 568.88
hello jeff gassett

573.839 --> 576.839
huh

587.279 --> 591.519
right but yeah pretty much yesterday it

590.16 --> 594.64
was just

591.519 --> 597.36
a lot watching what lots of stuff and

594.64 --> 601.04
videos and

597.36 --> 603.04
not playing games so much

601.04 --> 605.12
because i kind of like yeah the

603.04 --> 607.519
pathfinder king maker game i kind of

605.12 --> 610.72
finished it or rather got

607.519 --> 613.6
dead stuck in like the last

610.72 --> 616.0790000000001
like the final post-game phase

613.6 --> 617.76
which it obviously is but yeah i can't

616.079 --> 619.4399999999999
get through it because you can't rest

617.76 --> 622.48
there and you can't return anywhere to

619.44 --> 624.399
rest and then you just

622.48 --> 627.04
you end up with a depleted party that

624.399 --> 628.64
just can't survive the challenges i

627.04 --> 630.64
didn't they might have done it on

628.64 --> 633.04
purpose but you know that once you

630.64 --> 636.079
defeat it

633.04 --> 638.88
the game's gonna end anyway

636.079 --> 641.5999999999999
right i did already download the newer

638.88 --> 643.2
one because there's another pathfinder

641.6 --> 646.399
game

643.2 --> 648.6400000000001
from later

646.399 --> 648.64
but

650.079 --> 654.4799999999999
yeah i kind of like did the intro of

653.04 --> 655.36
that a bit

654.48 --> 658.0790000000001
but

655.36 --> 660.88
i haven't continued playing that

658.079 --> 663.519
so just mostly watch things

660.88 --> 664.88
yesterday

663.519 --> 667.68
i

664.88 --> 669.76
got to netflix again and watch the movie

667.68 --> 671.12
that i thought like oh that's

669.76 --> 673.12
different

671.12 --> 675.12
but then as i watched it it turned into

673.12 --> 677.519
something i didn't really expect but it

675.12 --> 679.92
was still an interesting

677.519 --> 679.92
movie

681.279 --> 685.2
a bit creepy but interesting

685.279 --> 688.6
the uh

689.6 --> 695.6800000000001
what's it forget

692.8 --> 695.68
the accountant

697.6 --> 703.279
basically about a uh

700.32 --> 705.839
sort of an autistic guy

703.279 --> 708.16
that is an accountant and like absurdly

705.839 --> 710.5600000000001
brilliant at it

708.16 --> 712.0
but at the same time he's kind of a

710.56 --> 714.3199999999999
secret

712.0 --> 714.32
like a

714.839 --> 721.44
private secret agent almost like a

718.0 --> 721.44
secret assassin but

722.32 --> 725.7600000000001
yeah it was

724.0 --> 728.16
kind of convincing like normally you

725.76 --> 731.76
think oh no not another one of those but

728.16 --> 734.24
this one was like

731.76 --> 738.48
was really detailed

734.24 --> 743.639
i was impressed and that's not easy

738.48 --> 743.639
and yeah it reminded me about things

746.399 --> 748.8
anyway

749.839 --> 754.5600000000001
but yeah kind of

751.68 --> 756.7199999999999
brutal action movie but at the same time

754.56 --> 759.8389999999999
like

756.72 --> 759.839
very psychological

761.68 --> 768.0
seeing me on martin's channel late

764.959 --> 770.959
yeah i do like chat in there a bit but

768.0 --> 773.839
dude like it's just a giant waterfall of

770.959 --> 773.8389999999999
people chatting so

774.399 --> 777.44
like you put a sentence down and like

776.32 --> 778.8000000000001
within

777.44 --> 780.8000000000001
10 seconds

778.8 --> 783.519
it's completely snowed under with like

780.8 --> 788.639
40 or 50 other comments so

783.519 --> 788.639
he has a lot of people hanging around

793.44 --> 796.8000000000001
right and normally

795.36 --> 799.36
typically there would be like a ball

796.8 --> 803.12
busters right in the same time slot so

799.36 --> 805.92
then i don't really hang around a lot

803.12 --> 807.92
but yeah no ball busters as expected

805.92 --> 809.68
so

807.92 --> 812.639
i just got in there as soon as it

809.68 --> 812.6389999999999
started anyway

813.279 --> 817.12
also watched

815.04 --> 820.7199999999999
continued the watching of

817.12 --> 820.72
own benjamin from friday

822.079 --> 827.56
so yeah i was just watching a lot of

823.68 --> 827.56
stuff yesterday night

841.36 --> 846.36
right so yeah what have you all been up

843.36 --> 846.36
to

864.48 --> 867.48
hmm

882.959 --> 887.5189999999999
any reflections on yesterday i haven't

884.8 --> 887.519
watched it back

896.16 --> 899.16
uh

900.079 --> 903.5999999999999
what's the temperature right now

904.03 --> 907.179
[Applause]

907.36 --> 911.8000000000001
the same 11 degrees

920.48 --> 923.9200000000001
all right but yeah today does feel very

922.32 --> 927.0790000000001
different from yesterday dude yesterday

923.92 --> 927.079
is just

929.6 --> 933.44
yeah that's some good energy

933.68 --> 937.92
i still feel kind of good but it's like

935.68 --> 941.6389999999999
more of a lazy sunday kind of feeling i

937.92 --> 941.639
don't know what that is

947.04 --> 952.399
i've been spreading effie and surprising

949.36 --> 952.399
how many people know

952.56 --> 957.8389999999999
oh no what exactly

955.04 --> 960.3199999999999
jeff gas had

957.839 --> 963.8000000000001
they know it exists or they actually

960.32 --> 963.8000000000001
know the arguments

990.48 --> 994.8000000000001
oh yeah by the way weird i've been

992.399 --> 998.24
getting i don't know i'm not sure troll

994.8 --> 1000.4799999999999
or maybe just regular baller channels

998.24 --> 1002.48
that are sending comments like oh oh

1000.48 --> 1004.5600000000001
arwin you must be so happy they're

1002.48 --> 1007.839
finally hiding the down votes and i'm

1004.56 --> 1007.8389999999999
like uh what

1008.0 --> 1011.6
but they're not hidden they're still

1010.16 --> 1013.92
right there

1011.6 --> 1015.9200000000001
i mean

1013.92 --> 1018.16
yeah

1015.92 --> 1019.519
i don't understand like the downvotes

1018.16 --> 1022.399
are still there

1019.519 --> 1024.72
unless maybe i'm the only one that can

1022.399 --> 1026.4
see them automatically like you can only

1024.72 --> 1027.919
see the down votes of your own channel

1026.4 --> 1029.2800000000002
but others can't i don't know what's

1027.919 --> 1030.88
going on

1029.28 --> 1033.039
what is really weird to hear people say

1030.88 --> 1035.919
oh you must be so happy i'm like no i

1033.039 --> 1035.919
never asked for that

1037.039 --> 1042.24
like if i was really so concerned about

1040.4 --> 1043.679
the picture of the votes i would have

1042.24 --> 1047.6
turned it off

1043.679 --> 1047.6000000000001
like a lot of flat earth channels have

1048.319 --> 1054.08
like cloakbusters and gerunism they have

1050.96 --> 1054.08
their votes turned off

1060.32 --> 1064.08
right i'm just leaving it the way it is

1062.32 --> 1067.2
so

1064.08 --> 1069.28
i don't know what this removing the

1067.2 --> 1071.039
visibility of downvotes is all about but

1069.28 --> 1073.6789999999999
it doesn't seem to be applying to my

1071.039 --> 1077.559
channel and i don't mind

1073.679 --> 1077.5590000000002
right i think it's kind of ridiculous

1085.6 --> 1090.8799999999999
they agree with you

1088.48 --> 1090.88
yeah but

1093.12 --> 1096.4799999999998
that look that can

1096.799 --> 1101.52
when you say like oh

1098.799 --> 1102.48
they know about it and then they agree

1101.52 --> 1105.44
with me

1102.48 --> 1108.4
well that could also mean that

1105.44 --> 1110.0800000000002
they're like on an intuitive level they

1108.4 --> 1111.919
know that you know what you're talking

1110.08 --> 1113.9189999999999
about that doesn't automatically mean

1111.919 --> 1117.8400000000001
that they understand that it just means

1113.919 --> 1119.5200000000002
that they're like oh yeah yeah okay okay

1117.84 --> 1121.12
you're the flat earther you probably

1119.52 --> 1123.12
know that doesn't mean that they

1121.12 --> 1124.3999999999999
actually understand it you gotta test

1123.12 --> 1126.4799999999998
somebody

1124.4 --> 1128.88
for that you gotta make them answer

1126.48 --> 1131.1200000000001
technicals

1128.88 --> 1132.7990000000002
to actually know if they really

1131.12 --> 1134.8799999999999
understand because they might have just

1132.799 --> 1136.559
been agreeing with you

1134.88 --> 1140.16
being like okay you're the flat earther

1136.559 --> 1142.0
you probably know about this right so

1140.16 --> 1144.559
did you test them

1142.0 --> 1147.039
you have gas hat do you test them or are

1144.559 --> 1149.6789999999999
people just very going along with you

1147.039 --> 1151.12
these days what is it

1149.679 --> 1154.1200000000001
hello by the way america's silver

1151.12 --> 1154.12
patriot

1178.559 --> 1181.2
right because i'm pretty sure that if

1180.16 --> 1185.039
i'm gonna

1181.2 --> 1186.72
like start talking to my roommate

1185.039 --> 1190.08
about flat earth

1186.72 --> 1192.0
she'd probably be like oh yeah yeah yeah

1190.08 --> 1193.12
but that wouldn't automatically mean

1192.0 --> 1195.919
that

1193.12 --> 1198.8799999999999
she would actually know any details any

1195.919 --> 1201.88
mechanics about it

1198.88 --> 1201.88
right

1207.039 --> 1210.48
you gotta test somebody

1208.799 --> 1212.8799999999999
about it it's like

1210.48 --> 1214.4
okay

1212.88 --> 1216.64
do you know

1214.4 --> 1218.4
why

1216.64 --> 1221.2
we can't be like

1218.4 --> 1222.24
a ball with gas pressure right next to

1221.2 --> 1223.52
it

1222.24 --> 1227.2
out

1223.52 --> 1230.24
without any barrier between the earth

1227.2 --> 1231.039
and outer space eternity vacuum

1230.24 --> 1235.84
like

1231.039 --> 1235.84
do they know the answer do they know why

1249.84 --> 1255.6
don't know just give them

1252.159 --> 1255.6000000000001
gas must be contained

1256.159 --> 1259.919
even look you could

1258.32 --> 1262.6399999999999
if they agree with you you could

1259.919 --> 1265.5200000000002
literally hand them every argument

1262.64 --> 1266.64
to further support your position

1265.52 --> 1268.0
and that you know what you're talking

1266.64 --> 1271.679
about that doesn't mean that they'll

1268.0 --> 1274.799
automatically also know it you see

1271.679 --> 1277.52
that usually ends up in them

1274.799 --> 1279.84
just trusting more that you

1277.52 --> 1282.799
at least seem to be know in the know of

1279.84 --> 1282.799
what you're talking about

1283.76 --> 1288.4
that doesn't mean that they're actually

1285.36 --> 1292.0
gonna also know the same information and

1288.4 --> 1294.4
be able to repeat it and use it see

1292.0 --> 1297.36
it just means they're in acceptance

1294.4 --> 1300.5590000000002
of you and what you do

1297.36 --> 1300.559
they're not objecting

1302.24 --> 1305.24
anyway

1314.32 --> 1319.039
huh

1315.76 --> 1321.44
four huge flat earth legs whoa

1319.039 --> 1321.44
all right

1326.88 --> 1331.44
huh

1329.12 --> 1334.32
good stuff that flat fella

1331.44 --> 1337.039
yeah i will somewhere today check out

1334.32 --> 1337.039
your videos

1339.2 --> 1343.559
gravity

1340.32 --> 1343.559
low snowbirds

1348.799 --> 1351.799
hmm

1371.28 --> 1376.559
all right well hey jeff if if that's

1373.36 --> 1376.559
like a recent thing

1377.2 --> 1380.88
that's that's good

1379.36 --> 1383.6789999999999
at least they're like

1380.88 --> 1384.96
starting out kind of with an open door

1383.679 --> 1387.2
right but that doesn't mean that they

1384.96 --> 1389.8400000000001
automatically know the arguments right

1387.2 --> 1391.44
that might take some more time

1389.84 --> 1393.28
if they don't

1391.44 --> 1395.44
eventually start resisting anyway

1393.28 --> 1397.9189999999999
because that can happen too you know you

1395.44 --> 1399.6000000000001
don't don't forget like

1397.919 --> 1402.88
flat earth is

1399.6 --> 1405.28
psychologically trying

1402.88 --> 1407.5200000000002
on people that

1405.28 --> 1409.28
haven't gone there yet so even if at

1407.52 --> 1410.48
first they might be like yeah yeah okay

1409.28 --> 1413.44
you're a flat earther you know about

1410.48 --> 1413.44
this stuff that's cool

1414.64 --> 1418.72
then if you eventually kind of start

1416.64 --> 1419.44
testing them if they actually understand

1418.72 --> 1421.3600000000001
it

1419.44 --> 1424.159
then they might suddenly be like wait

1421.36 --> 1426.8799999999999
but i don't really want to know

1424.159 --> 1428.48
like i'm accepting you please kind of

1426.88 --> 1430.4
leave me alone about it i don't want to

1428.48 --> 1432.64
think about those things that could

1430.4 --> 1435.919
happen too even though they started out

1432.64 --> 1439.1200000000001
very friendly and accepting so

1435.919 --> 1439.1200000000001
yeah it's not as

1439.52 --> 1442.0
easy

1442.799 --> 1445.2
with this sort of thing as you might

1444.4 --> 1447.44
think

1445.2 --> 1450.48
sometimes

1447.44 --> 1452.88
it's a case per case thing

1450.48 --> 1453.679
is clause schwab arrested

1452.88 --> 1456.4
yeah

1453.679 --> 1459.4
i've seen the rumors going around terret

1456.4 --> 1459.4
306.

1460.159 --> 1464.72
but

1461.2 --> 1464.72
yeah no confirmation so

1467.44 --> 1473.3600000000001
it would be a kind of a weird move

1470.159 --> 1477.1200000000001
too you know like what now you're gonna

1473.36 --> 1481.12
arrest him for financial fraud serious

1477.12 --> 1481.12
like why why would you do that now

1482.08 --> 1484.96
like what is that

1485.6 --> 1491.9189999999999
seems a very odd thing to do

1489.12 --> 1495.1999999999998
since like the program is still going

1491.919 --> 1496.5590000000002
full steam and he's kind of like a a top

1495.2 --> 1499.799
peacock

1496.559 --> 1499.799
of it

1504.32 --> 1509.76
and maybe it was something internal you

1506.48 --> 1511.52
know maybe it's like one of his

1509.76 --> 1514.0
backers is kind of like trying to

1511.52 --> 1516.48
blackmail him again or something dude

1514.0 --> 1517.679
you don't know what the hell his life is

1516.48 --> 1519.919
like

1517.679 --> 1522.72
that guy must be in tank with all kinds

1519.919 --> 1524.88
of shady [ __ ]

1522.72 --> 1524.88
so

1524.96 --> 1529.32
waiting for jesus tear it

1530.32 --> 1532.8799999999999
calm down

1536.24 --> 1542.159
i don't think that's gonna happen

1538.4 --> 1544.159
just yet terry 306 and besides like if

1542.159 --> 1547.919
it would suddenly start happening that

1544.159 --> 1547.919
would be very worrisome signal

1551.12 --> 1553.52
because

1552.24 --> 1555.44
like

1553.52 --> 1557.6
what is doing that

1555.44 --> 1559.76
are they going to replace it

1557.6 --> 1562.08
right could mean all kinds of things but

1559.76 --> 1563.679
yeah poof

1562.08 --> 1567.72
i don't think that anything like that's

1563.679 --> 1567.72
going to happen anytime soon

1576.4 --> 1580.88
all right also yeah i did pick up

1583.52 --> 1588.0
um yeah australia developments

1588.88 --> 1592.7990000000002
so yeah this morning i noticed this

1594.0 --> 1599.4
like that's cr that's just genuinely

1596.4 --> 1599.4
crazy

1600.24 --> 1603.279
right

1601.039 --> 1603.279
so

1603.44 --> 1608.64
selective lockdowns

1605.84 --> 1611.4399999999998
based on your fax that that is like what

1608.64 --> 1613.919
the [ __ ] dude

1611.44 --> 1616.4
like why don't you just

1613.919 --> 1619.039
tell that all unfaxed people have to

1616.4 --> 1621.44
wear a yellow star like serious dude

1619.039 --> 1621.44
this is

1621.6 --> 1626.3999999999999
this is like

1622.84 --> 1628.24
unprecedented as they would say but it

1626.4 --> 1630.5590000000002
is

1628.24 --> 1633.52
like this is a step further even like

1630.559 --> 1636.76
now it's just discriminatory

1633.52 --> 1636.76
it's crazy

1678.64 --> 1681.72
all right

1683.44 --> 1686.44
ugh

1720.48 --> 1725.84
all right so

1722.48 --> 1725.84
what's next

1726.64 --> 1728.88
oh

1733.039 --> 1736.32
started with the letter p

1736.559 --> 1739.559
what

1740.399 --> 1743.6
well

1741.52 --> 1745.76
yeah

1743.6 --> 1748.32
but look there's

1745.76 --> 1750.48
just use the address in

1748.32 --> 1752.72
the description box for my paypal flat

1750.48 --> 1753.919
flat fellow that's the one

1752.72 --> 1758.24
and yeah

1753.919 --> 1758.24
my full name is not just arwin

1759.36 --> 1762.559
and i think that in the typical

1760.82 --> 1764.24
[Music]

1762.559 --> 1766.6399999999999
registry of

1764.24 --> 1768.32
my name it's left out

1766.64 --> 1771.679
because it's kind of my middle name and

1768.32 --> 1771.6789999999999
i don't put that in

1772.52 --> 1776.399
compartmentalize my name like that

1776.88 --> 1779.88
so

1786.24 --> 1793.88
they let mitchell back to work no facts

1788.48 --> 1793.88
no mask yeah well good good on him

1794.88 --> 1798.48
but he is not like in the worst regions

1797.6 --> 1800.48
right

1798.48 --> 1801.84
he's not like in the middle of the

1800.48 --> 1804.559
province of

1801.84 --> 1807.72
region victoria

1804.559 --> 1807.72
and melbourne

1811.12 --> 1816.9189999999999

1813.6 --> 1816.9189999999999
love circle

1866.48 --> 1870.96

1881.679 --> 1886.039
but my ears are picking it up

1901.2 --> 1904.2
so

1917.36 --> 1921.7199999999998

maybe with headphones oh right yeah the

1971.039 --> 1973.76
sound's not coming through okay that's

1972.64 --> 1977.8400000000001
good

1973.76 --> 1977.84
it's just distracting anyway

1982.08 --> 1989.08
right it feels really good to have

1984.32 --> 1989.08
support by the way it really does

1991.86 --> 1995.4499999999998
[Music]

1998.159 --> 2002.7990000000002
like it's like actual insurance it's

2000.88 --> 2005.1200000000001
like

2002.799 --> 2006.799
you get it you know you can

2005.12 --> 2010.08
you know you're kind of doing the right

2006.799 --> 2010.08
thing like it's working

2010.64 --> 2016.5590000000002
like it's it's worth it

2013.84 --> 2018.399
and that's why i can continue

2016.559 --> 2021.36
right

2018.399 --> 2021.36
that's how i see it

2024.06 --> 2027.1499999999999
[Music]

2028.72 --> 2036.159
what happened to all the regulars

really early in

2038.24 --> 2041.279

a lot of people go

2047.12 --> 2052.0
to bed kind of late some like

2049.359 --> 2053.52
get in a party mood and then yeah then i

2052.0 --> 2056.079

2053.52 --> 2057.919
between four and six o'clock in the

2056.079 --> 2061.3590000000004
morning or wait maybe it's more like

2057.919 --> 2063.44
five and seven

2061.359 --> 2066.399
is not all that appealing to a whole lot

2063.44 --> 2066.399
of americans but

2066.72 --> 2073.7999999999997
internet stop toying with me what hello

it happens more often it's just people

2086.32 --> 2091.3590000000004
get to know me and then after a while

2089.52 --> 2093.599
they're like i don't know they're

2091.359 --> 2096.399
saturated or something or they kind of

2093.599 --> 2098.8
like figured out what they

2096.399 --> 2098.7999999999997
needed

2099.68 --> 2102.3999999999996
with

2100.839 --> 2104.48
me

2102.4 --> 2106.8
or sometimes just purely internal by

2104.48 --> 2109.2
being in my presence or something and

2106.8 --> 2112.0
then they kind of go away or they start

2109.2 --> 2114.0789999999997
like nagging in certain ways and like

2112.0 --> 2116.079
find a disagreement and then hold on to

2114.079 --> 2117.6800000000003
it and then they end up banning him

2116.079 --> 2120.8
there's a lot of yeah there's plenty of

2117.68 --> 2124.0
regular still out there that i've banned

2120.8 --> 2127.7200000000003
that to this day still complain about me

2124.0 --> 2127.72
that i ban people

2131.839 --> 2136.4
it happens

2133.68 --> 2137.52
it's like not like i'm gloating about it

2136.4 --> 2138.8
like i don't

2137.52 --> 2141.359
like that

2138.8 --> 2143.28
that that happens but

2141.359 --> 2145.119
yeah this there's just

2143.28 --> 2149.52
there has to be order

2145.119 --> 2151.6800000000003
i can't have like real people drama

2149.52 --> 2151.68
that

2152.4 --> 2158.52
that believe that like that's something

2154.48 --> 2158.52
that you can just do here

2160.72 --> 2164.3999999999996
like this is

2162.56 --> 2166.56
the setup at least is supposed to

2164.4 --> 2168.7200000000003
represent class

2166.56 --> 2172.24
and that's it's not the place for that

2168.72 --> 2174.3199999999997
this is not somebody's like family

2172.24 --> 2177.1189999999997
room or something where you can just

2174.32 --> 2179.44
like insert yourself as a family member

2177.119 --> 2181.92
and then start a whole

2179.44 --> 2181.92
issue

2182.48 --> 2188.079
like victim consciousness in some way or

2185.28 --> 2190.2400000000002
outrage that refuses to dim down

2188.079 --> 2192.7200000000003
and then expect that i'm gonna be like

2190.24 --> 2194.64
the husband adapting to that or

2192.72 --> 2196.72
something

2194.64 --> 2198.56
like no

2196.72 --> 2202.9599999999996
that's not

2198.56 --> 2202.96
that's not this show not not over here

2205.2 --> 2211.4399999999996
yeah hello andrew uncle steve

2208.64 --> 2213.04
a good servant still comes by he do he

2211.44 --> 2215.359
still donates even

2213.04 --> 2218.24
but i don't know

2215.359 --> 2220.16
but he's also doing his own thing

2218.24 --> 2221.9199999999996
like he has his own shows and i think

2220.16 --> 2224.48
they're like even daily

2221.92 --> 2224.48
at times

2226.079 --> 2230.88
ah yeah thank you flat earth radio

2228.64 --> 2233.359
i really appreciate that

2230.88 --> 2236.7200000000003
i deserve the backing that's awesome

2233.359 --> 2238.72
i'm glad i'm glad that i'm worth it

2236.72 --> 2240.56
you know

2238.72 --> 2242.9599999999996
i just don't want to be some

2240.56 --> 2245.359
crazy goofball that doesn't really have

2242.96 --> 2246.64
anything to offer

2245.359 --> 2248.88
but just

2246.64 --> 2248.8799999999997
like

2249.839 --> 2254.64
like just e-bagging without anything to

2252.4 --> 2257.839
present for it i don't want to be that

2254.64 --> 2257.839
guy absolutely not

2258.64 --> 2261.52
and in a sense

2261.68 --> 2265.2
the

2262.4 --> 2267.119
the donations also

2265.2 --> 2269.359
kind of like

2267.119 --> 2271.44
force me on a spiritual level like yeah

2269.359 --> 2274.24
you are getting the back is backing so

2271.44 --> 2276.0
now you have to actually perform you

2274.24 --> 2278.56
actually have to bring

2276.0 --> 2278.56
the goods

2280.32 --> 2286.32
it also does that

2282.72 --> 2288.56
but not in a draining way because yeah i

2286.32 --> 2290.96
get the financial backing so i'd have to

2288.56 --> 2292.96
worry about financial situations less

2290.96 --> 2294.48
and then i do have the room so then i

2292.96 --> 2297.96
can actually

2294.48 --> 2297.96
bring the goods

2298.0 --> 2301.119
works really well for me

2306.96 --> 2311.52
and perhaps it also serves on a

2309.119 --> 2313.599
psychological level for these supporters

2311.52 --> 2317.32
that they become a little bit more

2313.599 --> 2317.32
invested literally

2335.2 --> 2341.04
i was up at night almost every day

2337.839 --> 2342.56
watching fvd premieres i totally get i

2341.04 --> 2346.079
see you a lot in the late night

2342.56 --> 2346.0789999999997
premieres terror 306

2361.2 --> 2366.96
but yeah first thursday's

2364.8 --> 2369.2000000000003
fed was pretty good

2366.96 --> 2372.7200000000003
and that's the one that we got to see

2369.2 --> 2372.72
last last evening

2373.119 --> 2378.88
quite a contrast with the wednesday one

2374.88 --> 2381.28
that we got to see on friday wasn't it

2378.88 --> 2383.2000000000003
it was like super rowdy and triggered

2381.28 --> 2385.28
everybody not just me like everybody was

2383.2 --> 2387.9199999999996
kind of like that a bit

2385.28 --> 2389.44
but then except for nathan who somehow

2387.92 --> 2391.359
managed to keep his school all

2389.44 --> 2392.4
throughout it

2391.359 --> 2395.2
but

2392.4 --> 2396.64
yeah thursday show was a lot more

2395.2 --> 2397.52
minded

2396.64 --> 2400.56
and

2397.52 --> 2400.56
so was friday

2402.56 --> 2407.2799999999997
you watch horror movies yeah that's your

2404.48 --> 2407.28
problem dude

2408.839 --> 2413.7599999999998
if if you like that [ __ ] to

2412.0 --> 2416.4
spook around in your head as you're

2413.76 --> 2418.8
trying to calm down and sleep yeah sir

2416.4 --> 2422.599
check oh you do that

2418.8 --> 2422.599
i try not to

2429.04 --> 2432.04
great

2443.92 --> 2448.96
like what i would like to watch at night

2446.96 --> 2452.16
or

2448.96 --> 2454.48
before i go to bed is owen benjamin

2452.16 --> 2456.8799999999997
because that really brings me in into a

2454.48 --> 2458.079
good mood a lot of the time

2456.88 --> 2461.44
not so

2458.079 --> 2463.04
nervous or scary or

2461.44 --> 2467.319
just really

2463.04 --> 2467.319
mellow and laid back and

2471.92 --> 2474.0
and

2478.839 --> 2483.52
inspired it's not a problem okay sir

2481.68 --> 2487.3999999999996
check oh dude

2483.52 --> 2487.4
you do what you do

2508.94 --> 2512.07
[Music]

2520.8 --> 2525.8390000000004
right but anyway like i general i don't

2522.88 --> 2527.599
really like horror movies

2525.839 --> 2530.4
unless they're like

2527.599 --> 2532.8
not all about jump scares and

2530.4 --> 2535.6800000000003
everybody acting like complete retards

2532.8 --> 2538.2400000000002
in the face of some

2535.68 --> 2542.0789999999997
dronish

2538.24 --> 2542.0789999999997
murderer with whatever

2542.56 --> 2548.0789999999997
i don't really like those movies anymore

2545.44 --> 2551.2000000000003
but like for example the ruins that was

2548.079 --> 2555.119
like a genuine horror

2551.2 --> 2557.2799999999997
yeah if it's really scary at times

2555.119 --> 2559.2000000000003
that like that's why i don't spoil

2557.28 --> 2561.2000000000003
anything about the movie

2559.2 --> 2565.1189999999997
because there is like a serious

2561.2 --> 2567.5989999999997
unexpectant factor in it

2565.119 --> 2569.52
like i wouldn't watch the trailer

2567.599 --> 2572.0
before you start watching that it's

2569.52 --> 2574.16
probably better if you're completely

2572.0 --> 2575.839
unaware of what's gonna unfold when you

2574.16 --> 2576.839
watch that movie and then it's like

2575.839 --> 2578.7999999999997
really

2576.839 --> 2580.96
scary

2578.8 --> 2580.96
so

2581.44 --> 2586.16
but yeah the typical slasher [ __ ] and

2583.68 --> 2588.7999999999997
all yeah i thought that was kind of cool

2586.16 --> 2591.5989999999997
when i was like in my 20s but i don't

2588.8 --> 2594.96
like it anymore

2591.599 --> 2594.96
i mean sometimes

2595.2 --> 2599.359
it's definitely not what i'm gonna round

2596.88 --> 2602.2400000000002
out my day with

2599.359 --> 2604.839
right and even like

2602.24 --> 2606.4799999999996
type of spy

2604.839 --> 2609.04
action

2606.48 --> 2611.2
with like a lot of like murdering people

2609.04 --> 2615.52
basically assassination and all like

2611.2 --> 2615.52
that's already kind of creepy to me

2618.0 --> 2621.28
yeah

2619.119 --> 2624.0
and uh

2621.28 --> 2626.96
the accountant definitely fell into that

2624.0 --> 2629.599
category but it was like psychologically

2626.96 --> 2631.28
very developed

2629.599 --> 2632.7200000000003
and that

2631.28 --> 2636.5600000000004
makes it

2632.72 --> 2638.56
like so much better than any

2636.56 --> 2640.96
other like

2638.56 --> 2642.7999999999997
in a way yeah it but it is a stand-alone

2640.96 --> 2646.079
movie you know it's not like ooh this is

2642.8 --> 2646.079
a new franchise like

2646.319 --> 2650.88
mission impossible or something

2648.88 --> 2655.44
it's not one of those types of movies

2650.88 --> 2655.44
it's like a it's it's kind of serious

2658.319 --> 2662.2799999999997
i like halloween yeah

2664.16 --> 2671.2799999999997
what batman begins

2666.16 --> 2671.2799999999997
yeah batman begins is is pretty intense

2671.76 --> 2675.3590000000004
like that was a real shift from the old

2674.4 --> 2678.4
uh

2675.359 --> 2681.2
the old batman movie series

2678.4 --> 2681.92
which were much more cartoonish all of

2681.2 --> 2684.24
them

2681.92 --> 2685.92
different ways but like yeah when that

2684.24 --> 2689.52
new batman

2685.92 --> 2692.48
begins came out like that really changed

2689.52 --> 2692.48
the level a lot

2693.28 --> 2697.3590000000004
i haven't watched it in a while but yeah

2695.359 --> 2699.5989999999997
that was that made a big impression at

2697.359 --> 2699.5989999999997
time

2701.2 --> 2706.48
because it's like

2702.96 --> 2706.48
just really serious

2707.68 --> 2710.68
anyway

2722.96 --> 2725.96
huh

2744.839 --> 2749.52
oh

2746.8 --> 2749.52
what's happening

2752.8 --> 2755.92
somebody else donated

2757.119 --> 2760.52
who's that

2764.8 --> 2767.28
come on

2770.88 --> 2775.44
oh

2771.76 --> 2777.92

2775.44 --> 2780.96

yeah thank you very much dank that's

2783.2 --> 2788.24
awesome thank you for the support this

2785.119 --> 2791.359
is great

2788.24 --> 2791.359
it's gonna be a good week

2791.52 --> 2797.839
oh right now i remember

2795.04 --> 2800.319
like i also had a two-hour call with my

2797.839 --> 2802.72
friend in naimei again

2800.319 --> 2806.8
who was doing really good and had like

2802.72 --> 2809.52
an unsuspect yeah and a surprising

2806.8 --> 2811.28
life twist in a way

2809.52 --> 2813.7599999999998
like for real

2811.28 --> 2816.7200000000003
because yeah she has like constant

2813.76 --> 2820.88
issues

2816.72 --> 2820.8799999999997
with boyfriends that kind of just like

2821.44 --> 2825.76
try to manipulate her on a psychological

2823.599 --> 2828.319
level and she's like a sensitive very

2825.76 --> 2830.8
talented

2828.319 --> 2833.2799999999997
woman and a mother

2830.8 --> 2835.52
and yeah last time we spoke it was like

2833.28 --> 2838.96
uh you're you're gonna break up with

2835.52 --> 2840.96
your boyfriend because he's like

2838.96 --> 2841.92
being an alcoholic and it's just getting

2840.96 --> 2843.92
worse

2841.92 --> 2846.559
but that completely turned around

2843.92 --> 2848.88
apparently and that was like wow

2846.559 --> 2850.3190000000004
this is new

2848.88 --> 2852.48
so they're still together and he's

2850.319 --> 2856.079
actually stopped drinking

2852.48 --> 2859.839
and taking it really serious

2856.079 --> 2859.8390000000004
so that was like oh

2860.16 --> 2862.7999999999997
that's new

2863.839 --> 2866.7999999999997
so yeah she's doing

2870.839 --> 2876.16
great they're still together

2873.92 --> 2876.16
right

2876.4 --> 2880.48
but yeah that took two hours

2879.44 --> 2882.88
it

2880.48 --> 2884.079
yeah i now remember they uh she called

2882.88 --> 2888.4
like

2884.079 --> 2888.4
in the middle of martin luther's stream

2889.04 --> 2894.72
and then i got to see the tail end of

2892.319 --> 2896.5589999999997
saturday night

2894.72 --> 2898.24
like the first part and the last part

2896.559 --> 2900.0
and had it kind of visually in the

2898.24 --> 2901.5989999999997
background as i was like on the

2900.0 --> 2903.359
telephone with her

2901.599 --> 2907.44
huh

2903.359 --> 2911.359
one of my favorite movies is the thing

2907.44 --> 2911.359
yeah that's just freaking creepy

2911.92 --> 2916.2400000000002
a very successfully creepy movie at the

2914.64 --> 2917.92
time

2916.24 --> 2920.64
with

2917.92 --> 2923.28
like only practical special effects yeah

2920.64 --> 2923.2799999999997
i remember

2923.44 --> 2928.96
the remake is just complete waste of

2925.599 --> 2931.839
time characters all sucked

2928.96 --> 2933.359
but yeah the old one was really

2931.839 --> 2935.92
really tense

2933.359 --> 2935.92
i agree

2940.8 --> 2945.4
stone monkey

2942.4 --> 2945.4
huh

2969.68 --> 2975.359
oh wow time's flying just talking about

2972.72 --> 2975.359
movies and

2981.359 --> 2984.359
jesus

2985.04 --> 2990.2799999999997

3142.16 --> 3146.0789999999997
like yeah that was the washing machine

3144.319 --> 3146.8
it almost sounded like it was gonna blow

3146.079 --> 3150.7200000000003
up

3146.8 --> 3152.8
crazy i'm gonna have to check it out

3150.72 --> 3156.2799999999997
hope it's not broken

3152.8 --> 3156.28
that would suck

3170.319 --> 3175.44
that's an uneven load in washington yeah

3172.319 --> 3175.44
that's what i thought too

3175.92 --> 3181.599
i just never heard it get this insanely

3178.48 --> 3184.319
loud like i i just turned it off

3181.599 --> 3187.599
a guy like a two hour washing like i

3184.319 --> 3187.599
don't know what he's doing man

3188.72 --> 3191.72
whatever

3196.4 --> 3203.559
what the [ __ ] yeah you get

3198.96 --> 3203.559
that's an idiot get out

3209.68 --> 3214.7999999999997
washing machine not broken yeah

3212.079 --> 3214.8
i hope not

3216.16 --> 3222.7999999999997
maybe i'll do a wash later and just see

3219.599 --> 3224.559
if it gets this insanely loud again

3222.8 --> 3227.119
i thought it was just like ramming

3224.559 --> 3231.559
against something but it wasn't it was

3227.119 --> 3231.559
like purely internal so

3239.92 --> 3244.119
hello robert digital

3271.44 --> 3277.599
huh

3273.599 --> 3280.2400000000002
hey slow mo moon buggy good to see you

3277.599 --> 3281.599
dude slow-mo moon buggy

3280.24 --> 3284.24
like

3281.599 --> 3286.88
every time there's like a really good

3284.24 --> 3291.24
stream somewhere i always bump into you

3286.88 --> 3291.2400000000002
in chat every time

3293.52 --> 3299.04
like

3295.52 --> 3301.44
over at jim bobs or when fox day

3299.04 --> 3304.16
does a stream on d live

3301.44 --> 3306.16
like i always bump into you

3304.16 --> 3308.0789999999997
in places where it's like really

3306.16 --> 3312.0
concentrate like you know how to like

3308.079 --> 3312.0
get the really high level gravy

3314.799 --> 3319.119
yeah we have good taste like the good

3316.88 --> 3322.0
stuff

3319.119 --> 3323.76
but it's almost to me now bumping into

3322.0 --> 3324.96
you is like

3323.76 --> 3328.6400000000003
a sign

3324.96 --> 3328.64
like oh this is a good place

3328.96 --> 3333.2
like you're a fellow stag and i always

3331.2 --> 3336.24
just like oh it's it's it's the good

3333.2 --> 3338.3999999999996
stat like my body stag again so that

3336.24 --> 3341.68
means this is good drinking water and

3338.4 --> 3341.6800000000003
that's what it feels like now

3352.0 --> 3355.0
so

3365.76 --> 3372.3190000000004
i've had it donkey years what

3370.079 --> 3376.92
all right yeah no i'm yeah tony whitcomb

3372.319 --> 3376.92
like it's probably just fine

3377.359 --> 3381.52
it just

3379.28 --> 3383.44
well i also just wanted it turned off

3381.52 --> 3385.44
because it was like

3383.44 --> 3387.68
if you guys can freaking hear it on the

3385.44 --> 3389.04
mic that's like then it gets really

3387.68 --> 3391.839
disturbing

3389.04 --> 3391.839
so

3396.079 --> 3402.6400000000003
yeah recognizable goofy screen name

3399.68 --> 3402.64
it's a fun name

3403.359 --> 3407.839
but it's also like the icon that you use

3408.48 --> 3411.48
persistently

3425.44 --> 3430.839
you like it yeah

3427.76 --> 3433.76
it's great it works fine

3430.839 --> 3435.7599999999998
like if it was it would have been like

3433.76 --> 3437.6800000000003
three or four years ago

3435.76 --> 3440.3190000000004
then that picture might have been

3437.68 --> 3442.0789999999997
typically used for stock accounts

3440.319 --> 3444.96
by trolls

3442.079 --> 3448.88
but since you've like claimed it as your

3444.96 --> 3448.88
icon that stopped

3450.079 --> 3454.96
so you kind of like fixed the icon and

3452.4 --> 3457.76
now it isn't just a

3454.96 --> 3461.0
troll icon

3457.76 --> 3461.0
that's cool

3466.24 --> 3468.64
anyway

3472.64 --> 3475.839
yeah what have you been up to

3489.68 --> 3496.319
oh yeah yeah yeah i'd bump into you at

3492.16 --> 3499.799
quantum of conscious comment section too

3496.319 --> 3499.799
it's so typical

3513.44 --> 3518.88
but i guess that us guys are typically

3517.04 --> 3520.48
like

3518.88 --> 3523.359
living walking

3520.48 --> 3526.48
gravy seals of approval

3523.359 --> 3529.44
it's like if it's really cool and

3526.48 --> 3531.76
and focused and interesting then we

3529.44 --> 3534.64
start to speak up in chats and in

3531.76 --> 3534.6400000000003
comment sections

3535.599 --> 3541.2000000000003
because if it's just like something

3537.68 --> 3543.1189999999997
generic then i'm never gonna comment

3541.2 --> 3546.0789999999997
or oh there's something wrong i don't

3543.119 --> 3546.079
comment about that

3551.76 --> 3558.28
made by bingenbop cartoon oh really

3555.119 --> 3558.28
all right

3576.079 --> 3581.52
huh

3577.68 --> 3581.52
all right so you refuse to test

3583.599 --> 3588.559
and you they haven't disciplined you

3585.44 --> 3588.559
about it awesome

3593.839 --> 3596.839
good

3602.48 --> 3606.96
dude i've never done one of the tests

3604.799 --> 3609.96
i'm never gonna do one of the tests like

3606.96 --> 3609.96
no

3616.799 --> 3622.64
and i'm not gonna wear a mask

3618.88 --> 3625.119
and i'm not gonna be apologetic about it

3622.64 --> 3627.359
and when people tell me

3625.119 --> 3630.7200000000003
you have to do this that then i'm gonna

3627.359 --> 3633.2799999999997
just literally just immediately no

3630.72 --> 3633.2799999999997
it's not like

3633.76 --> 3639.119
sorry sir lady but i'm not gonna do that

3637.2 --> 3642.3999999999996
no it's just no

3639.119 --> 3644.0
just immediately no

3642.4 --> 3646.319
as in no

3644.0 --> 3648.72
no big deal

3646.319 --> 3650.319
and if they then are like but you have

3648.72 --> 3653.2
then it's like oh yeah but i got a card

3650.319 --> 3653.2
here and no

3653.52 --> 3659.92
i don't need to

3655.599 --> 3661.6800000000003
and that works really well for me so far

3659.92 --> 3665.7200000000003
i haven't had any

3661.68 --> 3665.72
real problems with it

3678.799 --> 3684.96
government states that you only have a

3681.119 --> 3687.96
test if you have symptoms only what

3684.96 --> 3687.96
okay

3698.079 --> 3701.3590000000004
right

3699.04 --> 3704.319
one of my favorites and it's almost kind

3701.359 --> 3706.96
of feels like a bit of a jedi mind trick

3704.319 --> 3709.599
is just like you need to wear a mask and

3706.96 --> 3711.839
like no i don't

3709.599 --> 3713.28
no i don't need to wear a mask like an

3711.839 --> 3714.96
official statement

3713.28 --> 3716.88
like nope

3714.96 --> 3719.44
then it's up to them to figure out what

3716.88 --> 3719.44
that means

3723.2 --> 3726.799
because they're

3724.24 --> 3729.2
probably not expecting that

3726.799 --> 3730.96
unless they're they're just very well in

3729.2 --> 3733.68
the know that there is a standardized

3730.96 --> 3734.96
medical exemption system

3733.68 --> 3737.44
like even

3734.96 --> 3737.44
from the

3738.839 --> 3742.799
government and if they're aware about

3740.88 --> 3745.2000000000003
that then usually then i don't even ask

3742.799 --> 3745.2
anymore

3750.96 --> 3755.039
bothers me

3752.64 --> 3757.5989999999997
is that it only took about one and a

3755.039 --> 3758.48
half years to get to this point what do

3757.599 --> 3760.079
you mean

3758.48 --> 3763.48
it's a gecko

3760.079 --> 3763.48
what's the context

3787.44 --> 3790.799
right yeah with tony whitcomb dude

3790.0 --> 3793.52
like

3790.799 --> 3798.72
the swaps and all that they on record

3793.52 --> 3798.72
have like really bad chemicals on them

3800.0 --> 3806.079
every time you absorb that you literally

3802.48 --> 3806.079
kind of absorb toxins

3806.72 --> 3810.5989999999997
it's not good for you

3821.28 --> 3825.8390000000004
the news has terrified people

3825.92 --> 3831.92
yeah it does

3828.559 --> 3834.0
but it's crazy though right so

3831.92 --> 3835.6800000000003
it's still going on around in in the

3834.0 --> 3838.16
netherlands i don't know how it works in

3835.68 --> 3839.68
other countries exactly

3838.16 --> 3842.24
but it's like

3839.68 --> 3843.9199999999996
yeah oh there's been a warning again

3842.24 --> 3846.4799999999996
from media and government you have to

3843.92 --> 3848.96
wear the mask again

3846.48 --> 3851.119
because with the risk of whatever you

3848.96 --> 3854.4
know how that goes and people do it

3851.119 --> 3855.44
again but that's insane

3854.4 --> 3857.44
because

3855.44 --> 3859.68
literally the same people that are now

3857.44 --> 3861.039
announcing this in government in our

3859.68 --> 3864.799
government

3861.039 --> 3867.8390000000004
have already publicly on camera admitted

3864.799 --> 3867.839
that it doesn't work

3868.48 --> 3875.2
they admitted it it doesn't work

3872.559 --> 3878.1000000000004
but it's still mandated and people still

3875.2 --> 3880.8799999999997
just wear it like

3878.1 --> 3883.92
[Music]

3880.88 --> 3883.92
that's insane

3885.44 --> 3888.76
that's creepy

3899.68 --> 3904.24
yeah soda pop

3901.599 --> 3907.52
goats yeah and don't forget a melon

3904.24 --> 3911.0389999999998
tested positive yeah yeah

3907.52 --> 3913.44
yeah but dude the maker of that test

3911.039 --> 3915.119
of that specific test like the original

3913.44 --> 3919.2000000000003
designer of it

3915.119 --> 3921.28
that put it on the market as a product

3919.2 --> 3923.68
like when this all started out he came

3921.28 --> 3926.1600000000003
out openly in the media like

3923.68 --> 3929.5989999999997
uh you're not supposed to use these

3926.16 --> 3931.44
tests for that that doesn't work

3929.599 --> 3932.7200000000003
it's not effective

3931.44 --> 3936.4
for

3932.72 --> 3938.0789999999997
what it's yeah what it's being

3936.4 --> 3941.039
utilized for

3938.079 --> 3943.2000000000003
in that way like that that doesn't work

3941.039 --> 3946.6400000000003
and explain in detail why and how like

3943.2 --> 3948.96
yeah it's completely

3946.64 --> 3950.5589999999997
senseless like it doesn't work like a

3948.96 --> 3953.52
quick test like that

3950.559 --> 3957.119
and there's like how do you isolate

3953.52 --> 3960.079
etc etc like the the very

3957.119 --> 3963.28
designer of the tests

3960.079 --> 3964.7200000000003
just said like no this doesn't work

3963.28 --> 3966.4
and it's still

3964.72 --> 3967.9199999999996
standardized and

3966.4 --> 3969.6800000000003
international

3967.92 --> 3971.76
you must be feeling like really weird

3969.68 --> 3973.5989999999997
about that right now

3971.76 --> 3975.039
because this product is selling even

3973.599 --> 3979.6400000000003
though he's like yeah but it doesn't

3975.039 --> 3979.6400000000003
actually work this is crazy

3988.24 --> 3990.4799999999996
what

3991.039 --> 3993.8390000000004
what do you mean clutch

3996.64 --> 3999.68
what

3997.76 --> 4003.5200000000004
are are you talking like

3999.68 --> 4005.68
the guy the man that made the tests

4003.52 --> 4007.7599999999998
and and came out with that he died of a

4005.68 --> 4010.3999999999996
heart attack is that who you're talking

4007.76 --> 4010.4
about clutch

4016.72 --> 4019.359
oh [ __ ]

4019.76 --> 4023.119
holy [ __ ]

4020.96 --> 4025.2
what i didn't even know that that's

4023.119 --> 4028.599
[ __ ] up

4025.2 --> 4028.5989999999997
what the hell

4036.079 --> 4040.2000000000003
that is just [ __ ] up

4059.68 --> 4063.0789999999997
kerry mullis

4063.28 --> 4065.599
what

4065.92 --> 4070.7200000000003
i don't know if that's the person we're

4067.76 --> 4072.3190000000004
talking about because

4070.72 --> 4076.0
the whole tests

4072.319 --> 4078.4
definite that issue came out after

4076.0 --> 4079.44
afterward

4078.4 --> 4081.28
so

4079.44 --> 4086.52
then not before

4081.28 --> 4086.52
the coveted [ __ ] started so check out

4111.279 --> 4114.4400000000005
all right

4118.799 --> 4124.48
well it's it's really meant yeah

4121.199 --> 4127.04
it it makes sense because

4124.48 --> 4130.239
if he literally openly came out with

4127.04 --> 4132.96
like yeah it doesn't work for that

4130.239 --> 4135.04
and he's literally the the product owner

4132.96 --> 4137.199
he could have

4135.04 --> 4139.44
decided to literally pull it off the

4137.199 --> 4141.04
market

4139.44 --> 4144.4
but yeah you can't do that when you're

4141.04 --> 4147.679
dead it's just taken us it just becomes

4144.4 --> 4150.159
a product of the system of

4147.679 --> 4152.4800000000005
his companies etc whatever how that

4150.159 --> 4152.48
works

4152.56 --> 4156.719
i don't know how it's how we had it set

4154.56 --> 4156.719
up

4158.799 --> 4162.839
but that's messed up man

4187.6 --> 4193.2390000000005
yeah cleary you are late

4189.92 --> 4193.2390000000005
very late

4198.97 --> 4202.06
[Music]

4207.92 --> 4210.92
so

4212.65 --> 4219.799999999999
[Music]

4224.239 --> 4229.04
we are never going to normal life even

4227.36 --> 4232.08
if you had the v

4229.04 --> 4234.32
yeah that seems to be the thing now

4232.08 --> 4237.28
right so before it's like oh you need

4234.32 --> 4238.799999999999
the v for immunization

4237.28 --> 4241.04
now it's just like no

4238.8 --> 4243.6
everybody must just keep pumping it keep

4241.04 --> 4244.48
pumping that's what it's become now

4243.6 --> 4249.1990000000005
right

4244.48 --> 4249.199
it they really turned it into a v cult

4251.12 --> 4255.44
it's all about the doubling down

4253.76 --> 4256.400000000001
a gambling

4255.44 --> 4259.839999999999
game

4256.4 --> 4261.759999999999
with life and people get addicted to the

4259.84 --> 4264.64
gambling because of the potential

4261.76 --> 4266.320000000001
benefits but as they're going even the

4264.64 --> 4270.400000000001
benefits are just stripped away and

4266.32 --> 4272.5599999999995
they're just left with that neurotic

4270.4 --> 4274.799999999999
addiction like more more need more

4272.56 --> 4277.280000000001
because it is safe because in my mind

4274.8 --> 4281.08
that's what i think it is

4277.28 --> 4281.08
like a ritual

4292.64 --> 4296.64
all right my life is normal because i

4294.719 --> 4298.719
make it that way that's right tony

4296.64 --> 4301.719
whitcomb that's how it that's how you do

4298.719 --> 4301.719
it

4301.84 --> 4307.04
right for me it was

4304.64 --> 4308.719
in a way easier

4307.04 --> 4311.6
because for me it was really the

4308.719 --> 4313.6
realization like okay everything that

4311.6 --> 4317.04
was out there

4313.6 --> 4319.84
the the freedom still based on money

4317.04 --> 4322.32
to be able to just do things

4319.84 --> 4325.360000000001
that's just over

4322.32 --> 4328.239
that phase has ended

4325.36 --> 4330.5599999999995
because the ones that were really like

4328.239 --> 4332.5599999999995
in control and upholding that

4330.56 --> 4334.2390000000005
possibility

4332.56 --> 4336.4800000000005
have now

4334.239 --> 4338.959999999999
cast

4336.48 --> 4341.28
the spell

4338.96 --> 4343.44
they are taking it out like the freedom

4341.28 --> 4344.32
that was once just taken for granted is

4343.44 --> 4347.599999999999
now

4344.32 --> 4347.599999999999
become conditional

4353.36 --> 4357.5199999999995
and they're not gonna give it back

4355.04 --> 4359.6
because they have no personal interest

4357.52 --> 4361.1990000000005
in giving it back because they're not

4359.6 --> 4363.84
doing it for our protection they're

4361.199 --> 4365.44
doing it for control and when you do it

4363.84 --> 4366.4800000000005
for control you're never going to give

4365.44 --> 4368.879999999999
it back

4366.48 --> 4372.718999999999
because why would you

4368.88 --> 4376.159000000001
giving it back only relinquishes control

4372.719 --> 4378.96
it'll just make the people relieved and

4376.159 --> 4380.5599999999995
then they're less manipulable

4378.96 --> 4383.199
so they're not going to give it back and

4380.56 --> 4384.719
i just realized that and accepted like

4383.199 --> 4386.799999999999
yeah

4384.719 --> 4388.56
that freedom society

4386.8 --> 4391.04
that i kind of grew up in and never

4388.56 --> 4394.88
really participated on a really deep

4391.04 --> 4399.36
level never sunk really deep into that

4394.88 --> 4400.56
i was kind of stuck to my solitary self

4399.36 --> 4404.239
that's gone

4400.56 --> 4407.04
like now you can't do that anymore and

4404.239 --> 4409.759999999999
i'm sort of okay with it

4407.04 --> 4412.48
i'm just worried about the people that

4409.76 --> 4415.280000000001
can't handle that that can't handle that

4412.48 --> 4416.5599999999995
literally the freedom of the world that

4415.28 --> 4417.28
was there

4416.56 --> 4421.280000000001
has

4417.28 --> 4423.44
in one fell swept swoop

4421.28 --> 4425.5199999999995
has been taken away and they're never

4423.44 --> 4428.4
gonna get it back and and they

4425.52 --> 4428.400000000001
psychologically

4429.04 --> 4431.44
didn't

4432.159 --> 4436.32
didn't see it coming

4433.92 --> 4438.08
they haven't prepared for it mentally

4436.32 --> 4440.96
and now it's just gone so now they

4438.08 --> 4445.28
become desperate to kind of grasp it

4440.96 --> 4446.08
back to even just imagine it back

4445.28 --> 4448.719
and

4446.08 --> 4451.12
roll into all kinds of

4448.719 --> 4451.12
traps

4452.48 --> 4459.36
a lot of which are fatal in the end

4455.84 --> 4461.679
and that's just really unfortunate and

4459.36 --> 4463.839999999999
i can't do anything about it

4461.679 --> 4466.8
except just kind of like try to shake

4463.84 --> 4469.04
people out of it metaphorically

4466.8 --> 4472.8
like saying like no dude you gotta give

4469.04 --> 4474.239
it up like that dream

4472.8 --> 4477.1990000000005
they've taken

4474.239 --> 4479.36
what you've taken for granted away

4477.199 --> 4482.4
and are now using it

4479.36 --> 4484.5599999999995
to lure you into a death trap

4482.4 --> 4486.5599999999995
you can't give in you got to be strong

4484.56 --> 4488.080000000001
you got to see it like this is a cold

4486.56 --> 4490.2390000000005
war

4488.08 --> 4491.6
and our opponent is not some other

4490.239 --> 4493.199
nation

4491.6 --> 4496.08
it's the government

4493.199 --> 4498.159
or rather the mega corporations kind of

4496.08 --> 4499.5199999999995
like

4498.159 --> 4501.679
keeping

4499.52 --> 4504.56
keeping the government very tight

4501.679 --> 4504.56
tightly locked

4505.679 --> 4508.159
under their

4508.84 --> 4513.1990000000005
control that's that's what we're facing

4511.6 --> 4514.88
all of us

4513.199 --> 4518.159
but you got to get out of the dream

4514.88 --> 4520.400000000001
first and realize that the society that

4518.159 --> 4522.32
we've taken for granted

4520.4 --> 4525.639999999999
all our lives

4522.32 --> 4525.639999999999
that's gone

4527.04 --> 4532.159
it will never return like that like even

4529.76 --> 4533.76
if they do seem to give back freedoms

4532.159 --> 4536.32
you know they're never gonna do it

4533.76 --> 4537.6
unconditionally you know they will again

4536.32 --> 4542.08
take it away

4537.6 --> 4542.08
because they've tasted this power now

4543.679 --> 4550.28
and they're not gonna forget about the

4546.239 --> 4550.28
taste of it you see

4552.0 --> 4556.88
the only way we can ever

4554.239 --> 4558.48
get some kind of free open society like

4556.88 --> 4562.2390000000005
that

4558.48 --> 4564.718999999999
is by completely reconstructing it from

4562.239 --> 4564.718999999999
scratch

4564.96 --> 4570.4
basically be like a free alternative

4568.0 --> 4572.719
globalism based on just people that

4570.4 --> 4572.719
crush

4573.84 --> 4578.400000000001
and then

4574.96 --> 4582.0
do all of what they've done

4578.4 --> 4584.08
from scratch starting more simple right

4582.0 --> 4588.08
like for example who's

4584.08 --> 4588.08
who's gonna stop like if there's like

4588.4 --> 4594.639999999999
alternative outside

4591.12 --> 4597.5199999999995
organized sport events like oh you have

4594.64 --> 4598.88
to be the league in this and connected

4597.52 --> 4602.080000000001
and all

4598.88 --> 4606.159000000001
or you just get together with like

4602.08 --> 4607.92
80 people and families and just like hey

4606.159 --> 4610.4
why don't we like build a tradition that

4607.92 --> 4612.719
we're gonna do football or

4610.4 --> 4614.96
baseball or something and just start

4612.719 --> 4616.159
doing that and then eventually people

4614.96 --> 4617.52
are gonna be like

4616.159 --> 4619.759999999999
why don't we just turn it in one of

4617.52 --> 4621.84
those old-fashioned games

4619.76 --> 4625.4400000000005
and you just start doing that

4621.84 --> 4628.0
completely outside of the system right

4625.44 --> 4631.28
build it up again from scratch build

4628.0 --> 4634.159
back that freedom except now it rests on

4631.28 --> 4636.96
your shoulders instead of on these big

4634.159 --> 4639.36
players with a lot of money that give

4636.96 --> 4640.719
you this opportunity

4639.36 --> 4644.639999999999
see

4640.719 --> 4647.28
you make the opportunity together

4644.64 --> 4650.280000000001
you don't let it be taken away from you

4647.28 --> 4650.28
again

4650.48 --> 4654.959999999999
that's the only way

4652.4 --> 4655.92
you could ever get

4654.96 --> 4658.159
back

4655.92 --> 4660.88
what kind of resembles the free open

4658.159 --> 4662.08
society that we've all grown up in

4660.88 --> 4665.159000000001
that's the only way you're going to get

4662.08 --> 4665.159
it back

4668.64 --> 4674.92
okay gadget inspector woof i'm not

4671.04 --> 4674.92
getting involved in that

4681.679 --> 4687.12
global warming locked out yeah they're

4683.44 --> 4687.12
gonna try that [ __ ] for sure

4689.76 --> 4695.1990000000005
no jab no job yeah that's been added for

4692.8 --> 4695.1990000000005
a while

4699.84 --> 4703.84
but there is pushback though a lot

4705.36 --> 4710.799999999999
and i can guarantee you that they are

4708.4 --> 4713.44
going to also do what i just described

4710.8 --> 4715.84
right oh no job node because you don't

4713.44 --> 4716.879999999999
get a v

4715.84 --> 4720.0
well

4716.88 --> 4723.12
make your own job

4720.0 --> 4725.44
use your discipline become independent

4723.12 --> 4728.32
i don't know get together with others

4725.44 --> 4730.4
that refused

4728.32 --> 4733.84
to be part of that

4730.4 --> 4737.199
and be an alternative form your own

4733.84 --> 4739.76
corporation together

4737.199 --> 4743.28
replace it take away their workers and

4739.76 --> 4746.159000000001
then literally compete

4743.28 --> 4749.84
they the french do know

4746.159 --> 4749.839999999999
how to do that sort of thing

4751.36 --> 4756.239
so i expect that that's like if they

4753.679 --> 4758.2390000000005
really push through that that nonsense

4756.239 --> 4760.799999999999
policy

4758.239 --> 4762.959999999999
that's gonna happen it's like the

4760.8 --> 4764.400000000001
the big city situation a lot of it is

4762.96 --> 4766.8
good just going to be abandoned and

4764.4 --> 4768.879999999999
you'll notice that yeah these people

4766.8 --> 4770.8
are just going to do their job in an

4768.88 --> 4772.64
entirely different setting somewhere

4770.8 --> 4774.159000000001
else

4772.64 --> 4775.4400000000005
and they're probably even going to do

4774.159 --> 4777.12
better

4775.44 --> 4779.12
than they were when they were still part

4777.12 --> 4781.12
of that system because of suddenly the

4779.12 --> 4784.4
actual freedom that they're experiencing

4781.12 --> 4784.4
not being constantly

4785.679 --> 4792.32
pulled back and forth by

4788.64 --> 4795.280000000001
like insurance policy like policy policy

4792.32 --> 4795.28
policy everywhere

4795.6 --> 4799.4400000000005
but anyway

4797.52 --> 4800.96
i hope that that it's gonna roll out

4799.44 --> 4804.12
like that

4800.96 --> 4804.12
it should

4829.6 --> 4833.2390000000005
suicide yeah

4855.92 --> 4858.96
huh

4857.12 --> 4861.84
all right guys inspector that's

4858.96 --> 4861.84
interesting

4862.96 --> 4866.88
right

4864.48 --> 4869.44
to kind of like be an alternative to

4866.88 --> 4872.2390000000005
ambulances

4869.44 --> 4872.239
you mean like that

4873.76 --> 4878.8
you yeah you would have to look into the

4876.32 --> 4882.4
legal implications of that though gadget

4878.8 --> 4882.400000000001
inspector it might be a bit risky

4884.8 --> 4887.360000000001
right you might

4886.639 --> 4889.6
be

4887.36 --> 4892.4
make be forced to have the people that

4889.6 --> 4894.719
actually utilize that service to

4892.4 --> 4896.0
to sign waivers

4894.719 --> 4898.88
to like

4896.0 --> 4898.88
that yeah to

4899.199 --> 4904.4
so that you can't get caught up in legal

4902.32 --> 4907.36
[ __ ] because of it right because they

4904.4 --> 4910.638999999999
would be taking an official risk that

4907.36 --> 4912.4
would not be like super heavily insured

4910.639 --> 4915.04
and mechanized

4912.4 --> 4917.04
as typical ambulances

4915.04 --> 4918.159
r

4917.04 --> 4920.0
so that might be a little bit

4918.159 --> 4922.239
complicated but who knows maybe that's

4920.0 --> 4924.56
they'll work out

4922.239 --> 4928.12
but be careful

4924.56 --> 4928.120000000001
interesting idea

4930.88 --> 4933.1990000000005
oh

4934.56 --> 4939.92
anarchy and who's talking about anarchy

4937.28 --> 4941.84
fox world

4939.92 --> 4945.36
you're the one bringing that up nobody's

4941.84 --> 4948.08
talking about anarchy here right all we

4945.36 --> 4948.08
want is

4948.96 --> 4953.6
the corruption to stop

4952.239 --> 4956.599999999999
to be

4953.6 --> 4956.6
handled

4959.199 --> 4962.96
but

4960.239 --> 4965.759999999999
nobody wants the government gone that

4962.96 --> 4967.28
would be a disaster

4965.76 --> 4968.88
we just want the

4967.28 --> 4971.12
[ __ ] up people

4968.88 --> 4972.4800000000005
that are doing this crazy anti-human

4971.12 --> 4974.08
demonic agenda

4972.48 --> 4975.04
out there

4974.08 --> 4976.719
so that

4975.04 --> 4982.08
well the government can

4976.719 --> 4984.96
again function what it was designed for

4982.08 --> 4987.199
instead of being like this crazy throne

4984.96 --> 4989.76
for a bunch of maniacs that are trying

4987.199 --> 4991.12
to literally exterminate humanity with

4989.76 --> 4994.12
their

4991.12 --> 4994.12
insanity

5000.239 --> 5005.199
you need a controller for yeah cleary no

5003.199 --> 5008.239
anarchy is [ __ ]

5005.199 --> 5010.879999999999
it's absolute trash

5008.239 --> 5013.12
pure anarchy doesn't work ever

5010.88 --> 5014.719
it's gonna be

5013.12 --> 5016.32
autocracy

5014.719 --> 5019.04
always

5016.32 --> 5021.199
because yeah if nobody's there to stop

5019.04 --> 5023.76
you to keep the peace

5021.199 --> 5025.678999999999
an official designary

5023.76 --> 5029.04
then

5025.679 --> 5032.08
somebody's gonna be like oh okay so i

5029.04 --> 5032.08
can just take it

5032.639 --> 5037.52
because i'm the strongest here i'm the

5034.56 --> 5037.52
most organized

5038.719 --> 5045.199
doesn't work govern you need government

5041.76 --> 5048.56
you just need it not to be corrupted

5045.199 --> 5048.5599999999995
not to be imperial

5051.6 --> 5056.320000000001
a government

5053.76 --> 5060.8
that consists of people that actually

5056.32 --> 5064.239
want to do their job correctly is great

5060.8 --> 5064.2390000000005
it makes things smooth

5066.8 --> 5071.76
but you gotta have people that genuinely

5069.28 --> 5074.8
want to fulfill that function

5071.76 --> 5077.84
in an honorable way

5074.8 --> 5079.1990000000005
and not just use it to grab or grab all

5077.84 --> 5082.159000000001
things

5079.199 --> 5085.199
and to manipulate people

5082.159 --> 5087.5199999999995
right it's it's just another kingdom

5085.199 --> 5090.239
like just like with a kingdom you have a

5087.52 --> 5093.52
good king and everything is epic and

5090.239 --> 5095.759999999999
inspiring and growing and

5093.52 --> 5099.040000000001
you get blessings and then

5095.76 --> 5100.88
the king dies or whatever and a new king

5099.04 --> 5103.04
or somebody else takes over and suddenly

5100.88 --> 5105.52
you got a really [ __ ] up king and then

5103.04 --> 5108.08
everything goes to [ __ ]

5105.52 --> 5110.719
and the same thing is for

5108.08 --> 5113.28
the government it's the same thing it's

5110.719 --> 5115.28
the same thing

5113.28 --> 5117.36
got good people in government it works

5115.28 --> 5120.159
great you got shitty grabblers in

5117.36 --> 5122.159
government then it sucks

5120.159 --> 5124.0
that's it

5122.159 --> 5126.638999999999
taking away government is not going to

5124.0 --> 5128.239
take away the problems

5126.639 --> 5131.12
doesn't work

5128.239 --> 5133.36
you're going to end up with autocracy

5131.12 --> 5136.08
some person is going to gather enough

5133.36 --> 5137.759999999999
power and strength and money and loyalty

5136.08 --> 5140.239
and he's just going to

5137.76 --> 5142.56
start dominating and terrorizing others

5140.239 --> 5145.12
because who's gonna stop him

5142.56 --> 5148.080000000001
nobody there's no government so they

5145.12 --> 5150.239
become the government by claiming it

5148.08 --> 5151.679
and that's not with rights like oh you

5150.239 --> 5154.32
think that somebody that's just gonna

5151.679 --> 5156.639
take power like that is gonna give

5154.32 --> 5159.44
people rights why would he you wouldn't

5156.639 --> 5162.96
have to there's nobody enforcing that

5159.44 --> 5166.36
right you don't want anarchy

5162.96 --> 5166.36
it's very simple

5172.0 --> 5175.0
so

5183.44 --> 5188.719
i mean you want as much freedom as

5185.52 --> 5190.320000000001
possible small government

5188.719 --> 5191.6
but

5190.32 --> 5196.32
like

5191.6 --> 5199.4400000000005
not no government there has to be some

5196.32 --> 5199.44
to keep the peace

5199.76 --> 5203.6
to

5200.639 --> 5204.96
make sure that things don't polarize out

5203.6 --> 5206.56
of control

5204.96 --> 5208.2390000000005
it's very ironic when you look at the

5206.56 --> 5210.400000000001
world right now and that's exactly what

5208.239 --> 5213.04
the government is doing because they're

5210.4 --> 5213.04
grabblers

5214.08 --> 5217.6
they're not performing their government

5216.32 --> 5221.08
function

5217.6 --> 5221.08
as they should

5229.12 --> 5232.96
what the hell

5230.96 --> 5235.04
gadget is are you talking about some

5232.96 --> 5237.36
football game or something i don't know

5235.04 --> 5238.719
i i don't have any thoughts on ireland

5237.36 --> 5243.04
beating

5238.719 --> 5243.04
the all blacks whatever that is

5246.719 --> 5250.679
i don't know what that is

5257.52 --> 5261.639
rugby right right

5268.639 --> 5272.96
darwin is correct that would promote

5270.639 --> 5274.4800000000005
evil people that's not what i said

5272.96 --> 5276.4800000000005
it's not

5274.48 --> 5278.08
no government doesn't promote evil

5276.48 --> 5279.28
people

5278.08 --> 5281.679
it just

5279.28 --> 5283.28
gives so much freedom that somebody with

5281.679 --> 5286.8
enough power

5283.28 --> 5289.36
can just decide to to basically take

5286.8 --> 5289.360000000001
control

5289.6 --> 5293.52
that's not evil people

5292.08 --> 5295.44
necessarily it's not like they

5293.52 --> 5296.8
automatically flow to the top during

5295.44 --> 5299.5199999999995
anarchy

5296.8 --> 5300.4800000000005
it's just that

5299.52 --> 5302.88
it

5300.48 --> 5305.28
always will end up in somebody

5302.88 --> 5306.2390000000005
fulfilling that government one way or

5305.28 --> 5308.8
the other

5306.239 --> 5310.0
with or without rights for the people

5308.8 --> 5312.400000000001
you see

5310.0 --> 5313.679
this is better to just have a basic

5312.4 --> 5315.839999999999
government

5313.679 --> 5318.2390000000005
structure

5315.84 --> 5321.360000000001
with the rights

5318.239 --> 5323.04
to prevent somebody from getting in

5321.36 --> 5325.599999999999
and taking it away

5323.04 --> 5327.76
but you still got to fight for that

5325.6 --> 5330.639
along the way anyway because there will

5327.76 --> 5332.320000000001
be people in government that might you

5330.639 --> 5334.159000000001
might start they might start out good

5332.32 --> 5336.88
and then they could still eventually

5334.159 --> 5338.799999999999
turn into gravelers

5336.88 --> 5341.4400000000005
that that's always going to be a risk

5338.8 --> 5345.1990000000005
always it's never going to be a perfect

5341.44 --> 5347.599999999999
government forever never ever

5345.199 --> 5347.599999999999
ever

5347.679 --> 5355.28
always going to be gravelers trying to

5349.92 --> 5359.1990000000005
get in always forever for all eternity

5355.28 --> 5359.199
you can never make that stop

5363.679 --> 5366.88
you happening to be vigilant forever and

5365.52 --> 5368.639
then

5366.88 --> 5369.84
you got to teach your children to be

5368.639 --> 5372.08
vigilant

5369.84 --> 5374.56
forever and then they got to teach their

5372.08 --> 5379.239
children to be vigilant forever

5374.56 --> 5379.2390000000005
that's the only viable option

5386.88 --> 5389.88
what

5394.96 --> 5398.88
what kind of a crazy thing is that to

5397.12 --> 5402.5599999999995
say fox world

5398.88 --> 5403.76
you would promote organized crime gangs

5402.56 --> 5407.4800000000005
you

5403.76 --> 5407.4800000000005
all right in there

5418.96 --> 5423.84
did i see my tunes run away from

5421.679 --> 5425.28
conspiracy castle on modern day debates

5423.84 --> 5428.4800000000005
no i didn't see that i don't really

5425.28 --> 5428.48
watch modern day debates

5428.639 --> 5432.6
but i take it it was hilarious

5434.0 --> 5436.96
all right anyway i'll be back in two

5435.44 --> 5440.28
minutes and then probably gonna round

5436.96 --> 5440.28
out the show

5536.96 --> 5539.96
um

5546.96 --> 5551.6
round out the show we just got here no

5549.199 --> 5553.28
the show's been going for over one and a

5551.6 --> 5555.92
half hours

5553.28 --> 5558.639
gadget inspector

5555.92 --> 5562.0
you were one of the first in chat so

5558.639 --> 5564.4800000000005
just got here well maybe it is

5562.0 --> 5569.0
the show is really good

5564.48 --> 5569.0
i could i could do it a little longer

5579.44 --> 5584.159
you watch every single news source

5585.44 --> 5590.32
you do fox world

5587.36 --> 5590.32
all right eden

5591.84 --> 5595.96
that sounds quite torturous

5625.6 --> 5631.84
set your alarm to an earlier time sounds

5628.719 --> 5631.84
impossible what

5642.84 --> 5646.4800000000005
sergio jesus

5650.32 --> 5655.759999999999
okay

5652.639 --> 5658.400000000001
do you also watch the view

5655.76 --> 5661.719
and saturday night live

5658.4 --> 5661.719
fox world

5678.32 --> 5681.199
checking every new source sounds

5679.92 --> 5683.52
impossible

5681.199 --> 5687.04
well not if you're going to be robotic

5683.52 --> 5689.679
about it and just like click click click

5687.04 --> 5691.5199999999995
all day long

5689.679 --> 5693.52
all the stupid talking hats and their

5691.52 --> 5695.280000000001
stupid narrative you'll be hearing like

5693.52 --> 5696.88
the same thing over and over again if

5695.28 --> 5699.759999999999
you do that

5696.88 --> 5702.0
i wouldn't want to live like that

5699.76 --> 5704.400000000001
i would like become

5702.0 --> 5707.76
seriously ill if i had to sit through

5704.4 --> 5707.759999999999
that every freaking day

5708.88 --> 5714.32
like i can barely

5711.679 --> 5717.36
watch more than 30 seconds of anything

5714.32 --> 5721.679
cnn related it just start to make me

5717.36 --> 5725.96
throw up literally just like holy [ __ ]

5721.679 --> 5725.96
you actually watch that

5732.08 --> 5736.239
rt you'll never say the same thing as

5734.08 --> 5738.8
yeah yeah yeah i agree well i do also

5736.239 --> 5741.28
follow rt

5738.8 --> 5743.4400000000005
not any live shows

5741.28 --> 5745.679
but like i do like follow the website

5743.44 --> 5748.638999999999
they do have some interesting articles

5745.679 --> 5752.119
sometimes very contrasting but still

5748.639 --> 5752.119
kind of mainstreamish

5753.6 --> 5757.2390000000005
like yeah

5758.0 --> 5762.239
but

5759.76 --> 5765.360000000001
yeah rt is like

5762.239 --> 5765.36
kind of an exception

5766.8 --> 5771.1990000000005
like because they just have some

5769.6 --> 5774.0
interesting things that you don't

5771.199 --> 5775.678999999999
typically hear

5774.0 --> 5778.48
and they have like

5775.679 --> 5780.4
studies to things

5778.48 --> 5781.919999999999
they just focus on something and i

5780.4 --> 5784.879999999999
appreciate that it's kind of like how

5781.92 --> 5789.119
the old bbc used to function

5784.88 --> 5789.119
before they became absolute evil

5795.6 --> 5798.96
but yeah that's just rt i don't really

5797.6 --> 5802.639
follow any other

5798.96 --> 5802.639
things i eat for wars but

5803.04 --> 5808.84
yeah there's a lot of programming in

5804.48 --> 5808.839999999999
there as well but i know about it

5814.8 --> 5821.28
yeah rt does push space a lot

5818.0 --> 5821.28
but that's not surprising

5822.08 --> 5826.4
and well

5823.52 --> 5828.56
the virus [ __ ] they do kind of latch on

5826.4 --> 5832.879999999999
to that

5828.56 --> 5835.280000000001
the sort of neutral but also kind of pro

5832.88 --> 5838.28
never really super anti

5835.28 --> 5838.28
and

5843.52 --> 5847.719
yeah so it's not perfect

5877.28 --> 5881.5199999999995
but we have one thing that does kind of

5879.119 --> 5882.799999999999
stand out to me i think

5881.52 --> 5885.52
with rt

5882.8 --> 5885.52
that they don't

5886.08 --> 5891.84
cartoonize

5888.4 --> 5891.839999999999
certain groups or something

5892.08 --> 5897.199
they really try to give honest analysis

5894.8 --> 5898.88
of whatever is involved

5897.199 --> 5900.96
most of the time

5898.88 --> 5903.28
but there's not like a succinct

5900.96 --> 5904.159
narrative that is being programmed like

5903.28 --> 5906.4
that

5904.159 --> 5908.08
like all these people are always bad

5906.4 --> 5911.04
right they don't do that sort of thing

5908.08 --> 5912.32
and i appreciate that also they have

5911.04 --> 5915.08
like

5912.32 --> 5916.799999999999
intricate analysis about

5915.08 --> 5919.119
sjw

5916.8 --> 5920.400000000001
and hollywood virtue signaling things

5919.119 --> 5922.32
and

5920.4 --> 5925.839999999999
also that

5922.32 --> 5925.84
knitting paradise

5926.0 --> 5930.44
so yeah it's kind of all over the place

5950.88 --> 5956.719
what

5952.48 --> 5958.718999999999
okay george sanford that's quite a claim

5956.719 --> 5960.32
the missing trillions from the two tower

5958.719 --> 5962.96
event

5960.32 --> 5965.96
went to buy up all the media

5962.96 --> 5965.96
really

5966.159 --> 5972.4
how did you trace that

5969.119 --> 5972.4
i mean you're talking about

5973.119 --> 5978.719
you're talking about like the the gold

5976.159 --> 5981.679
in the basement of building seven that

5978.719 --> 5982.88
would just was missing they didn't find

5981.679 --> 5986.32
it back

5982.88 --> 5988.2390000000005
right but how did you trace that

5986.32 --> 5989.92
how do you how can you actually say that

5988.239 --> 5991.199
oh yeah look

5989.92 --> 5993.52
i've got the

5991.199 --> 5994.5599999999995
i've got that money transfer records

5993.52 --> 5997.4400000000005
right here

5994.56 --> 6001.119000000001
it went straight into the media

5997.44 --> 6001.119
foundations like what

6004.48 --> 6008.5599999999995
i mean is it your suspicion or did you

6006.56 --> 6011.4400000000005
actually find some

6008.56 --> 6011.4400000000005
evidence for that

6016.56 --> 6020.639
yeah silverstein had a really good

6018.239 --> 6022.799999999999
insurance on the towers he did it's like

6020.639 --> 6025.04
the biggest the highest

6022.8 --> 6026.4800000000005
insurance ever

6025.04 --> 6028.0
on something that's completely

6026.48 --> 6030.159
impossible

6028.0 --> 6031.76
like it's still impossible just because

6030.159 --> 6033.92
it's claimed to have happened doesn't

6031.76 --> 6036.719
make it possible

6033.92 --> 6039.28
because yeah an airplane flying in the

6036.719 --> 6042.159
building doesn't make it crash down ever

6039.28 --> 6044.96
it's never happened before it's only

6042.159 --> 6048.32
one time allegedly that it happened in

6044.96 --> 6049.92
history and that's 911

6048.32 --> 6051.84
because it's just structurally

6049.92 --> 6055.52
impossible to do that with the steel

6051.84 --> 6055.52
frame building it's impossible

6055.679 --> 6059.84
mechanically impossible and he was

6057.84 --> 6064.6
insured for it anyway for

6059.84 --> 6064.6
billions i think crazy

6068.48 --> 6073.239
the trolls are watching yeah sure they

6070.239 --> 6073.239
are

6082.32 --> 6086.08
watch a few vids of guys putting it

6084.48 --> 6089.919999999999
together within

6086.08 --> 6094.0
the year after most media got taken over

6089.92 --> 6095.6
well there was like a move on media

6094.0 --> 6098.239
but like

6095.6 --> 6101.76
did they actually like trace the money

6098.239 --> 6103.44
i haven't seen any videos of that sort

6101.76 --> 6104.84
i mean if you got a really good and

6103.44 --> 6109.119
concise

6104.84 --> 6109.119000000001
one i'd i'd watch it

6111.44 --> 6116.4
but not if it's just like

6113.92 --> 6118.159
kind of diffuse

6116.4 --> 6120.4
it's got to be real proof

6118.159 --> 6123.599999999999
a real case otherwise it's just gonna be

6120.4 --> 6123.599999999999
like another rumor

6129.84 --> 6134.56
the media supported a 911 narrative from

6132.32 --> 6137.84
day one yeah but that's because it's

6134.56 --> 6137.84
like government

6141.04 --> 6145.6
you could say there is a conspiracy but

6143.44 --> 6148.719
there was and still is a conspiracy

6145.6 --> 6151.119000000001
between the media those media groups and

6148.719 --> 6153.44
the government

6151.119 --> 6156.239
like that was very apparent

6153.44 --> 6156.239
even back then

6160.88 --> 6165.1990000000005
but yeah

6162.48 --> 6165.199
that was

6167.44 --> 6172.32
already kind of underway before 9 11

6170.8 --> 6174.320000000001
happened

6172.32 --> 6176.08
so it doesn't make sense that oh 9 11

6174.32 --> 6179.759999999999
happened and then everything was brought

6176.08 --> 6179.76
up when it was already

6179.84 --> 6184.4800000000005
underway it was already unrolling

6182.96 --> 6186.88
while it was still happening how does

6184.48 --> 6188.48
that work how can you pay something off

6186.88 --> 6191.84
with something you haven't really

6188.48 --> 6191.839999999999
collected yet

6203.28 --> 6208.4
right

6204.639 --> 6208.400000000001
that's true george sanford

6216.159 --> 6220.638999999999
the racist say that you said something

6223.84 --> 6227.119000000001
well

6224.639 --> 6228.32
don't they always make it their business

6227.119 --> 6230.88
to have

6228.32 --> 6233.84
involvement in almost everything

6230.88 --> 6233.84
anyway

6235.199 --> 6238.239
i mean

6236.4 --> 6240.638999999999
like i haven't seen enough evidence to

6238.239 --> 6243.36
say like they're the ones that organized

6240.639 --> 6247.4400000000005
it but they were like

6243.36 --> 6248.719
in the know of it seemingly

6247.44 --> 6251.719
and

6248.719 --> 6251.719
yeah

6269.04 --> 6272.04
huh

6294.719 --> 6298.96
mainstream media devil's communication

6299.28 --> 6304.08
well

6301.119 --> 6305.5199999999995
it used to be like an independent

6304.08 --> 6308.4
thing

6305.52 --> 6310.2390000000005
remember when media and the ones that

6308.4 --> 6311.199
got the television and all that and the

6310.239 --> 6313.919999999999
news

6311.199 --> 6316.719
that they were actually there to keep a

6313.92 --> 6319.92
check on the government to make sure

6316.719 --> 6321.36
that the people were informed about

6319.92 --> 6324.2390000000005
things that they would need to be

6321.36 --> 6327.119
concerned about to well keep government

6324.239 --> 6332.718999999999
under control remember that time

6327.119 --> 6335.44
it's like 80 years ago now something

6332.719 --> 6336.719
what is it 80 60 years ago

6335.44 --> 6339.44
remember

6336.719 --> 6341.36
when media was doing that

6339.44 --> 6344.32
yeah and then freaking big business got

6341.36 --> 6347.759999999999
involved that's when the technocracy the

6344.32 --> 6347.759999999999
the new oligarchy

6348.0 --> 6352.4
the new robber barons started to

6352.96 --> 6356.84
get involved started to grab or buy

6355.04 --> 6359.6
things up and yeah

6356.84 --> 6362.400000000001
media it got bought

6359.6 --> 6364.639
and it then got standardized

6362.4 --> 6368.4
like puppet actors rolling out the

6364.639 --> 6368.400000000001
agenda of big money

6369.119 --> 6372.48
but it didn't start out that way

6370.56 --> 6374.56
originally like journalism was like a

6372.48 --> 6377.919999999999
discipline

6374.56 --> 6377.92
where you would be like

6378.32 --> 6382.799999999999
opposing government

6380.8 --> 6385.119000000001
potentially

6382.8 --> 6387.84
like opposing corruption in government

6385.119 --> 6390.08
yeah remember it's like a vague memory

6387.84 --> 6392.08
now like oh did you remember like

6390.08 --> 6396.5599999999995
journalism

6392.08 --> 6396.5599999999995
once that actually meant something hmm

6397.44 --> 6403.44
doesn't seem to be like that anymore now

6400.159 --> 6405.92
except for just like people that do like

6403.44 --> 6407.759999999999
private journalism with youtube and

6405.92 --> 6409.36
stuff and like oh i'm just gonna report

6407.76 --> 6411.280000000001
this i'm just gonna say what i think

6409.36 --> 6412.799999999999
about it

6411.28 --> 6414.88
but that's not really organized

6412.8 --> 6417.4400000000005
journalism

6414.88 --> 6420.56
because actual journalists take risks

6417.44 --> 6423.44
because they do oppose powers

6420.56 --> 6425.76
that's what they're supposed to be doing

6423.44 --> 6429.32
that's the discipline that's what it was

6425.76 --> 6429.320000000001
created for

6452.32 --> 6455.32
hmm

6468.639 --> 6473.84
i'm gordzilla when was it yeah yeah i

6471.28 --> 6475.92
know that happened

6473.84 --> 6478.32
federal reserve act and all that yeah

6475.92 --> 6481.4400000000005
and guess what journalists

6478.32 --> 6482.5599999999995
in that time were against it they were

6481.44 --> 6484.5599999999995
like

6482.56 --> 6486.159000000001
this sucks

6484.56 --> 6488.96
and i think there has even like been

6486.159 --> 6490.4
assassinations of the ones that were

6488.96 --> 6492.32
trying to

6490.4 --> 6493.839999999999
really ring the alarm about it at the

6492.32 --> 6496.08
time

6493.84 --> 6498.96
but i don't think journalists ever

6496.08 --> 6500.5599999999995
really were like oh after that period

6498.96 --> 6505.88
like the 50 years after we're like

6500.56 --> 6505.88
really pro federal reserve or anything

6539.199 --> 6542.719
different audiences harder to admit like

6541.28 --> 6545.599999999999
well yeah that's one way of looking at

6542.719 --> 6547.679
it but who's to say that back then

6545.6 --> 6549.119000000001
people in with media and journalists

6547.679 --> 6551.28
were even

6549.119 --> 6554.28
wanting to lie

6551.28 --> 6554.28
right

6554.639 --> 6558.159000000001
just be because it's harder doesn't mean

6556.48 --> 6559.5199999999995
that they're like oh i can't wait to

6558.159 --> 6562.239
just start

6559.52 --> 6564.719
mind controlling people that all hell

6562.239 --> 6568.28
that they were like that that's

6564.719 --> 6568.28
probably not

6580.4 --> 6584.5599999999995
right anyway i am rounding out the show

6582.32 --> 6584.5599999999995
