[Music]

29.599 --> 37.79
see sh

33.01 --> 37.79
[Music]

70.24 --> 75.52
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

73.759 --> 78.84
bird number

75.52 --> 80.72
1966 I'm your host Arwin and before

78.84 --> 84.07900000000001
start the show please don't forget to

80.72 --> 86.439
share it on any platform you de fit and

84.079 --> 88.79899999999999
if you haven't already subscribe to my

86.439 --> 90.75899999999999
channel and hit the Bell notification so

88.799 --> 93.24000000000001
you know when I'm going live live which

90.759 --> 96.0
is normally 2 p.m. Amsterdam time every

93.24 --> 97.96
day and please also do support me

96.0 --> 99.56
through the PayPal and the patreon

97.96 --> 101.52
that'll be much appreciated and I can

99.56 --> 104.60000000000001
always use the

101.52 --> 108.32
support right so yeah sorry for starting

104.6 --> 108.32
so late I had a very late

109.479 --> 113.439
night weather today

113.96 --> 119.91999999999999
is I don't know it's kind of

117.079 --> 122.399
nice was kind of sunny right before the

119.92 --> 127.56
show started now

122.399 --> 127.56
Sun or a cloud moved in front of it

128.479 --> 136.44000000000003
obviously but yeah today seems a little

131.56 --> 136.44
less clouded blue sky here and

141.519 --> 150.59900000000002
there let's see Focus you can do

147.08 --> 154.59900000000002
this huh

150.599 --> 154.599
it's a bit of wind though Ah that's

168.239 --> 171.239
better

171.599 --> 180.48
right

174.12 --> 183.72
anyway it is Sunday the 2nd of June 2024

180.48 --> 183.72
low clear first in

190.44 --> 197.28
chat temperatures 18°

193.599 --> 201.79899999999998
C 0% precipitation oh that's

197.28 --> 201.799
nice and 57%

205.519 --> 209.92000000000002
humidity so it's basically the same

208.04 --> 211.84
temperature as yesterday but it feels a

209.92 --> 214.83999999999997
lot

211.84 --> 214.84
warmer

221.239 --> 227.04
huh

223.4 --> 227.04
right so yeah

229.36 --> 233.68
yesterday let's see

245.04 --> 251.239
yeah yes the show went pretty well

248.4 --> 255.12
considering the circumstances but there

251.239 --> 255.12
was this weird thing in the air I had

255.28 --> 260.12
this real Sinking Feeling Again after

258.44 --> 265.36
the

260.12 --> 265.36
show I couldn't really place it I really

267.68 --> 271.72
couldn't and then later

278.199 --> 283.479
I was just kind of looking around and

280.759 --> 285.84000000000003
like cuz one way to like get rid of that

283.479 --> 288.88
sinking feeling is by just basically

285.84 --> 291.35999999999996
hearing other people chat so I was just

288.88 --> 294.52
kind of like in Discord just listening

291.36 --> 297.759
to a bunch of people talk and then

294.52 --> 301.35999999999996
suddenly like Infowars went live with

297.759 --> 304.16
the Saturday stream

301.36 --> 307.039
and was a yeah it's like an real

304.16 --> 311.28000000000003
emergency situation

307.039 --> 311.28
CU basically Alex

311.479 --> 318.4
was kind of emotional because he was

315.68 --> 320.08
threatened that they would padlock the

318.4 --> 323.31899999999996
studio and all

320.08 --> 326.35999999999996
that this guy going after

323.319 --> 328.16
him and he ended up doing like a 5H hour

326.36 --> 331.639
stream with like the whole team

328.16 --> 331.639
everybody was there and it was

331.72 --> 334.16
it was

343.28 --> 346.28
intense

354.4 --> 358.4
see it

374.12 --> 377.4
but yeah that kind of kept me

378.639 --> 383.039
up and I think it's probably going to be

381.319 --> 386.759
all

383.039 --> 390.24
right I mean the Alex is just getting

386.759 --> 392.12
bullied basically by this guy was just

390.24 --> 395.639
threatening him and trying to manipulate

392.12 --> 395.639
and set him up and all that

397.199 --> 404.36
and it's probably not going to

401.24 --> 407.36
happen because of yesterday's

404.36 --> 409.72
show lots of stuff happening out there

407.36 --> 414.0
in the world like some shooting happen

409.72 --> 414.0
again and so it's

415.919 --> 421.52
like I got the feeling that it's it's

418.72 --> 421.52000000000004
going to continue

425.12 --> 431.039
but it was kind of emotional

427.479 --> 433.919
and like

431.039 --> 438.87899999999996
yeah I've been watching Infowars for a

433.919 --> 438.87899999999996
long time like almost 20

439.0 --> 449.12
years and I would like to it to continue

442.36 --> 449.12
and it's been just yeah long journey

456.039 --> 461.479
someone's lighting Fire Works what a

458.36 --> 461.47900000000004
crazy hour to do

467.599 --> 470.84
that all

476.52 --> 482.24
right anybody wanted to check out that

479.039 --> 486.87899999999996
broadcast there's a lot of swearing in

482.24 --> 486.879
it then here it is

522.0 --> 528.56
right also I just tried out like the new

525.04 --> 530.3199999999999
monitor with a cable but apparently the

528.56 --> 532.8389999999999
HDMI

530.32 --> 535.2
slot from my graphics card is not

532.839 --> 537.6800000000001
functioning so I have to like return the

535.2 --> 540.12
cable and like get another type of cable

537.68 --> 542.2399999999999
that will be like a HDMI

540.12 --> 544.88
2 DVI

542.24 --> 548.44
cable which is kind of

544.88 --> 551.72
annoying but the monitor did seem to

548.44 --> 553.36
work just fine like it did it didn't

551.72 --> 555.9590000000001
connect to the computer but it did

553.36 --> 558.92
actually just give proper display so

555.959 --> 558.92
it's not broken or

559.56 --> 563.64
anything but yeah it's going to take a

561.56 --> 566.1199999999999
little longer before I I get the new

563.64 --> 566.12
monitor

567.6 --> 574.64
installed all right

571.079 --> 574.64
that new monitor over

581.68 --> 584.68
there

584.959 --> 587.959
huh

598.32 --> 601.32
right

628.32 --> 632.279
for for

681.88 --> 687.959
all right the meantime the wh situation

685.56 --> 691.2399999999999
is getting a bit worse they're like

687.959 --> 691.2399999999999
maneuvering their

702.2 --> 705.2
crap

711.56 --> 718.76
annoying right so hey anybody

715.2 --> 722.72
there besides clear who out to grab some

718.76 --> 722.72
coffee I already got some coffee right

739.36 --> 746.8000000000001
here hello through the

743.16 --> 751.16
furnace does free fall mean why does d

746.8 --> 751.16
Ser the density diseases in free fall

752.72 --> 755.0
yeah it

755.199 --> 759.7199999999999
doesn't what Free Fall means

760.399 --> 766.6
is something

763.639 --> 770.399
moving to try

766.6 --> 772.1990000000001
to create an equilibrium of the medium

770.399 --> 773.24
with its surroundings and so it's going

772.199 --> 775.68
to

773.24 --> 778.399
then create that relative density

775.68 --> 780.3199999999999
disequilibrium Force it's going to

778.399 --> 783.76
displace the

780.32 --> 786.0400000000001
object and while it's displacing that's

783.76 --> 790.16
called

786.04 --> 790.16
freeall let something is stopping

792.04 --> 799.639
at uh to say that relative density ends

796.36 --> 803.48
in freefall is like yeah it's actually

799.639 --> 806.48
happening the relative density is

803.48 --> 809.6800000000001
happening to then say like yeah the

806.48 --> 811.44
relative density this equilibrium Force

809.68 --> 814.12
isn't happening when the relative

811.44 --> 818.44
density this equilibrium force is

814.12 --> 818.44
happening that's what that means it's

818.6 --> 826.12
ridiculous it does not seize in free

822.199 --> 826.12
fall it's in the middle of

828.959 --> 837.4399999999999
it maximum displacement in free

833.44 --> 837.44
fall uh

843.92 --> 849.92
well no because things could what's the

847.279 --> 849.92
maximum

852.68 --> 857.4799999999999
displacement freeold just means that the

855.16 --> 861.959
relative density dis equilibrium force

857.48 --> 863.8000000000001
is fully applied and there's no nothing

861.959 --> 869.16
obstructing the

863.8 --> 870.4399999999999
motion besides air so in free fall only

869.16 --> 873.8
air

870.44 --> 873.8000000000001
friction is going

874.72 --> 882.6800000000001
to create a maximum velocity

879.519 --> 886.079
Etc but I mean what's causing the Free

882.68 --> 886.079
Fall is relative density

893.72 --> 897.839
disequilibrium so hope that answers the

896.079 --> 901.04
question I mean it's kind of stupid that

897.839 --> 901.0400000000001
Dell keeps saying that

915.079 --> 921.04
hey Clary who cares what Dell says well

918.839 --> 922.839
it's got people thinking and puzzled and

921.04 --> 925.24
they're trying to figure out figure it

922.839 --> 925.24
out

926.079 --> 930.959
so people want to understand why he says

928.8 --> 930.959
that

934.0 --> 939.199
well he says that because he wants to

936.399 --> 942.519
presuppose that relative

939.199 --> 945.24
density is not the cause of the vertical

942.519 --> 949.6
passive displacement but that it

945.24 --> 949.6
is the entire realm moving

951.639 --> 957.92
upward but I mean the claim that oh well

955.759 --> 960.9590000000001
if something is in freef Fall relative

957.92 --> 963.88
density doesn't apply app to it yeah but

960.959 --> 968.0
it is literally applying to it and that

963.88 --> 971.12
is why it is Free Falling like it's it's

968.0 --> 974.88
a phenomenon the freef fall is a

971.12 --> 976.8
phenomenon it's Free Falling because it

974.88 --> 979.92
this

976.8 --> 983.8
equilibrium it's a direct cause of

979.92 --> 988.319
it if something directly causes a

983.8 --> 988.319
phenomenon then that phenomenon

989.36 --> 994.279
does not mean that the cause of that

992.36 --> 996.6
phenomenon certainly doesn't apply

994.279 --> 1001.12
anymore because it's literally happening

996.6 --> 1001.12
because of it it's it's

1006.72 --> 1011.519
ridiculous yeah what Dell's talking

1009.04 --> 1011.519
about

1011.959 --> 1017.079
is how did they use to call it

1021.519 --> 1024.8
is there's like an

1025.199 --> 1032.88
apparent yeah actual shift that happens

1028.959 --> 1032.88
within any object that might be

1033.0 --> 1039.959
moving so the forces of relative density

1037.12 --> 1042.319
being subjecting themselves to the

1039.959 --> 1045.439
object including the internal

1042.319 --> 1050.08
workings causes like an

1045.439 --> 1053.3600000000001
apparent yeah actual shift within the

1050.08 --> 1057.9189999999999
forces to create a counter opposite

1053.36 --> 1061.28
effect so if something is falling at

1057.919 --> 1063.88
freeall the whole thing is moving and

1061.28 --> 1067.6399999999999
then anything within it is going to be

1063.88 --> 1067.64
relatively neutral and

1068.96 --> 1073.44
chaotic right but that's because the

1071.52 --> 1075.24
whole thing is

1073.44 --> 1078.48
falling

1075.24 --> 1081.64
but and if it would fall faster than

1078.48 --> 1085.24
normal freefall then the

1081.64 --> 1085.24
alignment will even

1085.72 --> 1090.4
reverse but this is just like what

1087.96 --> 1093.48
happens when objects are subjected to

1090.4 --> 1096.919
forces and like how the forces

1093.48 --> 1099.72
redistribute themselves but to say that

1096.919 --> 1102.48
that means that those forces aren't

1099.72 --> 1105.84
happening is ridiculous because it's

1102.48 --> 1105.84
happening because of the

1106.6 --> 1113.099
forces Hello Steven Jarvis

1110.03 --> 1113.099
[Music]

1114.28 --> 1116.6
hello

1125.36 --> 1133.0
issg thanks for makes yes you're welcome

1129.6 --> 1135.4399999999998
and see clearly that's why people can

1133.0 --> 1139.039
ask questions about that and they will

1135.44 --> 1139.039
help clear it up

1142.82 --> 1146.55
[Music]

1158.12 --> 1161.9599999999998
right so what Dell's basically

1159.679 --> 1163.64
concerning himself with and thinks that

1161.96 --> 1167.28
it's some kind of a proof that the

1163.64 --> 1170.88
relative density is bunk is that once an

1167.28 --> 1174.12
object actually goes into motion because

1170.88 --> 1177.2
of relative density

1174.12 --> 1179.9599999999998
disequilibrium that whatever's inside of

1177.2 --> 1183.44
the object like the

1179.96 --> 1185.919
forces within that object as it is

1183.44 --> 1188.1200000000001
moving because of relative density this

1185.919 --> 1190.44
equilibrium like the forces with inside

1188.12 --> 1192.8799999999999
are going to redistribute themselves

1190.44 --> 1196.039
it's like a a

1192.88 --> 1200.159
fractal counter opposite

1196.039 --> 1203.679
effect for yeah that's just what

1200.159 --> 1206.8400000000001
happens but the original force is still

1203.679 --> 1206.8400000000001
happening to the whole

1213.52 --> 1219.679
thing right it's the same effect as like

1216.88 --> 1222.3600000000001
a car there's a helium balloon inside of

1219.679 --> 1225.159
the car you accelerate forward the

1222.36 --> 1228.12
helium balloon is going to bolt

1225.159 --> 1231.2800000000002
forward because that's where it's going

1228.12 --> 1231.28
to be the least

1235.12 --> 1240.6789999999999
dense because of the forces that are

1238.4 --> 1244.52
redistributing within the

1240.679 --> 1247.799
car that is being subjected to a

1244.52 --> 1250.96
accelerating force in its

1247.799 --> 1254.32
entirety what whatever is inside of the

1250.96 --> 1255.919
object as it is moving well yeah

1254.32 --> 1259.36
everything is going to

1255.919 --> 1262.88
basically brace against it take take an

1259.36 --> 1264.4399999999998
opposite type of position Force wise

1262.88 --> 1267.2
that's just what happens but that

1264.44 --> 1270.559
doesn't mean that the original Force

1267.2 --> 1270.559
certainly doesn't exist

1271.48 --> 1278.3600000000001
anymore right because relative

1274.12 --> 1284.1589999999999
density system is always

1278.36 --> 1284.1589999999999
about what happens from a stationary

1285.88 --> 1291.8400000000001
perspective if an entire thing or system

1289.44 --> 1294.6000000000001
is being subjected to some kind of

1291.84 --> 1295.8799999999999
motion or an acceleration well then

1294.6 --> 1299.1589999999999
relative

1295.88 --> 1302.8400000000001
density From perspective of taking the

1299.159 --> 1304.4
moving object as its own reference frame

1302.84 --> 1306.36
well from that reference frame

1304.4 --> 1309.88
perspective then relative density is not

1306.36 --> 1313.08
going to apply anymore why because the

1309.88 --> 1318.48
whole thing is being subjected to a

1313.08 --> 1318.48
force and that rearranges realigns

1319.76 --> 1324.12
how matter is going to redistribute

1321.88 --> 1324.1200000000001
within

1330.27 --> 1334.4
[Music]

1331.799 --> 1335.96
it science says relative density is

1334.4 --> 1338.0
specific gravity well that's fine you

1335.96 --> 1341.72
want to call it specific gravity that's

1338.0 --> 1346.0
all just fine I just call it relative

1341.72 --> 1349.0
density you can also call it density

1346.0 --> 1354.24
Theory that's probably

1349.0 --> 1354.24
more recognized like from within

1358.12 --> 1365.6399999999999
physics right relative density specific

1361.88 --> 1368.1200000000001
gravity density Theory it's pretty much

1365.64 --> 1368.1200000000001
the same

1376.039 --> 1380.96
thing argue with though I don't give

1378.679 --> 1380.96
[ __ ]

1381.559 --> 1386.76
dude oh because he's a big guy oh well

1384.96 --> 1389.76
then I wouldn't talk back to his

1386.76 --> 1392.559
absolute hor

1389.76 --> 1394.919
[ __ ] yeah I will but let him get

1392.559 --> 1397.36
frustrated I mean come on BR like

1394.919 --> 1398.64
seriously me Dell in the same room yeah

1397.36 --> 1401.279
I will push you like what are you going

1398.64 --> 1401.279
to do hit

1403.0 --> 1409.36
me and what's the consequences of doing

1406.24 --> 1412.52
that like no no Absol absolutely I will

1409.36 --> 1412.52
not hold back in any

1414.64 --> 1422.039
way I mean he's just wrong and he's

1418.72 --> 1426.76
holding on to The Bitter End to being

1422.039 --> 1429.799
just wrong for years now I am not going

1426.76 --> 1431.72
to accommodate for

1429.799 --> 1434.76
anything about

1431.72 --> 1440.44
him he's just wrong and he's holding on

1434.76 --> 1440.44
to just being wrong and I'm like yeah

1442.559 --> 1446.44
not going to adapt to anything about

1444.44 --> 1448.44
that it's just

1446.44 --> 1449.96
wrong like everything he's been

1448.44 --> 1452.52
complaining about from the start

1449.96 --> 1455.32
concerning this subject I explained I

1452.52 --> 1459.679
put in the title of a hangout

1455.32 --> 1459.6789999999999
everything every issue

1479.32 --> 1482.84
right it I mean it's very simple you

1481.08 --> 1485.32
have an object you have stuff in the

1482.84 --> 1487.9189999999999
object the object's going to accelerate

1485.32 --> 1490.08
any direction for whatever reason it's

1487.919 --> 1492.3600000000001
going to accelerate in that direction

1490.08 --> 1494.08
well guess what the less dense things

1492.36 --> 1495.9599999999998
within the object compared to the more

1494.08 --> 1499.72
dense things in the object less dense

1495.96 --> 1501.24
things are going to be pulled forward

1499.72 --> 1503.64
while the more dense things are going to

1501.24 --> 1506.76
be pulled

1503.64 --> 1509.1200000000001
backward that's just what

1506.76 --> 1511.76
happens that's what happens when an

1509.12 --> 1515.0
object that isn't just one uniform

1511.76 --> 1518.96
material that's all solid and

1515.0 --> 1518.96
stuck that's what it's going to

1524.36 --> 1530.4399999999998
do it's like material's way of bracing

1528.559 --> 1532.76
against the force that it's being

1530.44 --> 1536.559
subjected to

1532.76 --> 1539.08
like the density alignment which is like

1536.559 --> 1543.52
yeah less dense things go up more dense

1539.08 --> 1548.24
things go down yeah that axis which is a

1543.52 --> 1550.76
virtual axis it adapts to whatever Force

1548.24 --> 1553.039
you're going to apply so right you have

1550.76 --> 1555.08
an object you have a car it accelerates

1553.039 --> 1559.48
in that direction it's going that way

1555.08 --> 1560.6789999999999
well guess what the axis of the relative

1559.48 --> 1562.88
is going to

1560.679 --> 1566.3200000000002
tilt because the whole thing is being

1562.88 --> 1566.3200000000002
subjected to a force

1566.919 --> 1573.96
right now of course this is the whole

1570.679 --> 1577.679
Keystone for Dell's argument you could

1573.96 --> 1580.88
pre suppose that the original axis in

1577.679 --> 1583.3200000000002
the stationary situation is there

1580.88 --> 1585.7600000000002
because the Earth is accelerating up and

1583.32 --> 1589.36
that's why the axis of the density

1585.76 --> 1591.919
distribution is vertical like that

1589.36 --> 1596.6
but that's a presupposition and you can

1591.919 --> 1596.6000000000001
literally never ever prove

1598.64 --> 1604.48
it and if you refuse to submit to that

1602.24 --> 1606.44
fact well then you'll just be

1604.48 --> 1608.159
presupposing and arguing it for the rest

1606.44 --> 1612.0
of your life and that's kind of what

1608.159 --> 1612.0
Dell seems to be doing

1618.64 --> 1625.039
right anyway I'm going to take a bite on

1620.32 --> 1625.039
my Illuminati CU I'm really hungry

1631.52 --> 1634.589
[Music]

1662.88 --> 1669.0390000000002
So yeah thank you for asking a technical

1669.919 --> 1677.48
question and allowing me the opportunity

1673.039 --> 1677.48
to explain that

1681.44 --> 1685.2
I mean relative density and the

1683.279 --> 1688.44
complexities of it is kind of my

1685.2 --> 1690.919
specialty I rarely even get to it

1688.44 --> 1694.559
anymore so I'm always happy if somebody

1690.919 --> 1697.96
actually wants to ask for clarification

1694.559 --> 1697.96
in that direction

1701.21 --> 1704.43
[Music]

1707.04 --> 1710.1299999999999
[Music]

1724.159 --> 1730.24
apparently somebody made a bio computer

1726.76 --> 1730.24
out of a piece of a human

1730.919 --> 1737.48
brain some Swiss company of course the

1733.559 --> 1737.48
Swiss had to do it

1743.96 --> 1746.799
they're calling it

1749.12 --> 1754.76
wetwear but I mean interesting though

1751.72 --> 1757.2
because this is just

1754.76 --> 1761.12
like like the bio computers that are

1757.2 --> 1765.3600000000001
even in Star in Star Trek Voyager like

1761.12 --> 1765.36
that was standard issue there

1768.919 --> 1774.8400000000001
they had like bio packs that were like

1772.24 --> 1777.32
processors and apparently that's that's

1774.84 --> 1777.32
happening

1783.88 --> 1791.0
now oh they only seem

1787.36 --> 1794.399
bioprocessor last 100 days that's not

1791.0 --> 1794.399
very great

1802.36 --> 1805.24
but I mean it is

1815.48 --> 1822.0
interesting why does displacement get

1818.12 --> 1822.0
lumped together with relative density

1822.12 --> 1829.399
disequilibrium what do you mean

1824.44 --> 1829.3990000000001
LSG what do you mean lump together

1847.039 --> 1852.64
what displacement is volume uh

1853.32 --> 1859.8799999999999
no volume is available space

1856.279 --> 1864.399
displacement is motion

1859.88 --> 1864.3990000000001
within available space not the same

1881.2 --> 1884.2
thing

1886.44 --> 1894.559
yeah this equ equilibrium means non

1890.24 --> 1894.559
equilibrium that's right

1910.16 --> 1914.8190000000002
[Music]

1924.04 --> 1928.559
[Music]

1925.559 --> 1928.559
d

1951.08 --> 1955.519
right I mean

1952.679 --> 1958.3600000000001
displacement is what

1955.519 --> 1961.36
happens when relative density dise

1958.36 --> 1961.36
equilibrium

1961.559 --> 1965.44
happens unless there's no

1963.399 --> 1968.559
maneuverability and then it

1965.44 --> 1972.0800000000002
will exert pressure in the direction

1968.559 --> 1972.08
instead of motion

1980.96 --> 1983.8400000000001
doesn't matter how you move a bottle

1982.6 --> 1987.039
with

1983.84 --> 1988.1999999999998
water how is displacement motion now but

1987.039 --> 1991.72
here's the

1988.2 --> 1991.72
thing relative

1992.039 --> 2001.36
density like the mechanism of relative

1995.639 --> 2005.519
density is from a stationary

2001.36 --> 2009.639
perspective that means that it's not

2005.519 --> 2013.1200000000001
relative you see

2009.639 --> 2015.519
if an object is in motion then from that

2013.12 --> 2018.36
motion based perspective if you take

2015.519 --> 2021.0
that as the standard reference frame

2018.36 --> 2022.639
well things are not going to be just oh

2021.0 --> 2025.399
they're less dense oh they go up more

2022.639 --> 2027.7199999999998
dense go down within it because the

2025.399 --> 2030.6789999999999
whole thing is

2027.72 --> 2033.799
moving arguably accelerating so guess

2030.679 --> 2036.6000000000001
what now the relative density axis is

2033.799 --> 2038.399
going to be redistributed within that

2036.6 --> 2042.1999999999998
moving thing

2038.399 --> 2042.1999999999998
why because it's not

2044.399 --> 2050.839
stationary yeah if the

2046.72 --> 2053.76
medium is moving then any objects within

2050.839 --> 2056.44
that Medium are not going to follow the

2053.76 --> 2059.8790000000004
standard vertical axis of relative

2056.44 --> 2059.879
density dise equilibrium

2060.119 --> 2068.2000000000003
displacement the axis is going to

2063.48 --> 2070.359
be altered depending on the motion of

2068.2 --> 2070.359
the

2073.839 --> 2080.399
medium right because Normal relative

2076.359 --> 2082.639
density theory is based on the medium

2080.399 --> 2086.3199999999997
being

2082.639 --> 2088.879
stationary that's how it works perfectly

2086.32 --> 2091.8
if the medium is accelerating in some

2088.879 --> 2095.2799999999997
direction then the axis of relative

2091.8 --> 2099.6400000000003
density displacement within that

2095.28 --> 2099.6400000000003
accelerating medium is going to

2102.88 --> 2107.119
shift within the moving

2111.119 --> 2118.0
medium the aredes principal I don't know

2115.0 --> 2120.4
maybe whatever it's not really relevant

2118.0 --> 2120.4
Steven

2124.37 --> 2130.68
[Music]

2126.64 --> 2130.68
Jarvis for

2168.48 --> 2174.0
right but I mean this is the main factor

2170.72 --> 2175.7599999999998
that Dell always overlooks when he

2174.0 --> 2177.88
complains about how relative density

2175.76 --> 2179.44
doesn't

2177.88 --> 2182.8
work

2179.44 --> 2185.2000000000003
because he overlooks that relative

2182.8 --> 2189.0
density works

2185.2 --> 2192.2
perfectly within a station

2189.0 --> 2193.119
medium if the medium in which something

2192.2 --> 2195.96
is

2193.119 --> 2199.2400000000002
moving or could

2195.96 --> 2200.96
move is not stationary like a bottle of

2199.24 --> 2203.72
water like the

2200.96 --> 2205.68
bottle is an object within a stationary

2203.72 --> 2208.24
medium it's going to behave according to

2205.68 --> 2211.319
relative density perfectly but the

2208.24 --> 2214.24
bottle of water itself is also its own

2211.319 --> 2217.16
subm medium a micro medium a medium

2214.24 --> 2219.5989999999997
within a medium well that Medium is

2217.16 --> 2223.0789999999997
going to be moving when you throw

2219.599 --> 2227.44
it and so the standard relative density

2223.079 --> 2230.6400000000003
axis of displacement no longer applies

2227.44 --> 2232.319
to that medium in motion because if a

2230.64 --> 2236.0
medium is in motion

2232.319 --> 2242.2799999999997
then the way it moves is going

2236.0 --> 2242.28
to alter the axis of

2243.68 --> 2249.0
displacement caused by relative density

2246.0 --> 2251.319
disequilibrium

2249.0 --> 2254.68
and that's just something they'll like

2251.319 --> 2256.92
never ever recognize he hasn't recogn I

2254.68 --> 2259.44
don't think he even has the faculties to

2256.92 --> 2263.28
actually understand it I think he's too

2259.44 --> 2266.52
[ __ ] dim to get that part cuz I've

2263.28 --> 2272.3590000000004
explained that like dozens of

2266.52 --> 2273.48
times including like with him verbally

2272.359 --> 2275.88
being

2273.48 --> 2278.16
there he doesn't get it he either

2275.88 --> 2280.52
doesn't want to get it or he's too siick

2278.16 --> 2280.52
to get

2283.24 --> 2288.24
it I kind of hope for him he's too thick

2286.2 --> 2289.56
to get it because otherwise he's just a

2288.24 --> 2293.0789999999997
[ __ ]

2289.56 --> 2296.92
liar and he's push pushing something

2293.079 --> 2299.52
false on purpose then so I really hope

2296.92 --> 2302.359
he's just too [ __ ] thick to get

2299.52 --> 2307.04
it because otherwise he's kind of

2302.359 --> 2307.04
evil and so in confusion

2317.88 --> 2320.6400000000003
so is there

2322.96 --> 2328.04
Clarity is it clear can I have some

2328.8 --> 2334.079
feedback yeah relative density dis

2332.56 --> 2338.319
equilibrium

2334.079 --> 2340.48
Force follows a perfect vertical axis

2338.319 --> 2342.599
if the

2340.48 --> 2345.079
medium is

2342.599 --> 2347.44
stationary if the whole medium is in

2345.079 --> 2349.5600000000004
motion then anything that might be

2347.44 --> 2351.64
passively displacing itself because of

2349.56 --> 2354.48
relative density dise equilibrium of an

2351.64 --> 2358.359
object within the moving

2354.48 --> 2360.92
medium yeah well then the axis by which

2358.359 --> 2362.88
that displacement happens is going to

2360.92 --> 2369.2400000000002
alter it's going to

2362.88 --> 2372.4
shift relative density axis shift

2369.24 --> 2372.3999999999996
if the medium is

2377.119 --> 2382.52
moving and here comes the funniest part

2380.599 --> 2385.079
the part where you really want to

2382.52 --> 2387.16
presuppose if your D that the Earth is

2385.079 --> 2392.52
accelerating

2387.16 --> 2395.44
upward if you accelerate an object

2392.52 --> 2399.319
downward at a slightly faster than

2395.44 --> 2399.319
normal fall rate guess what happen

2400.72 --> 2406.0
the relative density axis becomes

2406.88 --> 2411.599
neutralized and then you can presuppose

2409.48 --> 2414.68
that it's neutralized because what

2411.599 --> 2418.4
causes the relative density aess to

2414.68 --> 2420.48
happen is there's a force downward or

2418.4 --> 2422.079
the entire realm is actually

2420.48 --> 2425.079
accelerating

2422.079 --> 2427.44
upward but you'll never get that

2425.079 --> 2430.28
conception beyond the presupposition

2427.44 --> 2430.28
because you can't prove

2443.16 --> 2448.68
it yes Steven Jarvis that's what he

2445.68 --> 2448.68
thinks

2457.68 --> 2465.48
ships displays a volume of yeah but

2461.76 --> 2469.8390000000004
that's that happens outside of the

2465.48 --> 2474.119
ship relative density applies to a

2469.839 --> 2476.56
medium which means a a space in which

2474.119 --> 2478.92
things can freely

2476.56 --> 2482.04
move that is

2478.92 --> 2485.2000000000003
contained if the air can move freely

2482.04 --> 2489.04
through a medium to outside of the

2485.2 --> 2489.04
medium it doesn't work

2489.359 --> 2492.319
yeah if you have a car and you

2490.76 --> 2494.28
accelerated forward and you have a

2492.319 --> 2498.079
helium

2494.28 --> 2501.76
balloon if it's closed it's going to bub

2498.079 --> 2504.4
forward the balloon if you accelerate

2501.76 --> 2507.44
forward if you have a convertible and

2504.4 --> 2510.2000000000003
you have open roof guess what that

2507.44 --> 2512.7200000000003
balloon's not going to bop forward you

2510.2 --> 2514.2799999999997
know why because the

2512.72 --> 2519.2
air

2514.28 --> 2522.119
is like not moving along with the medium

2519.2 --> 2524.7999999999997
so it's going to just stay in its place

2522.119 --> 2528.04
and push everything backward it only

2524.8 --> 2531.04
works if the medium is closed

2528.04 --> 2534.8
off and accelerating as a

2531.04 --> 2538.44
whole then a relative density actual

2534.8 --> 2538.44
shift will happen

2549.319 --> 2553.5589999999997
hello n for

2553.96 --> 2559.48
Life yeah don't forget to Rogan it up

2556.44 --> 2562.8
indeed and share the show I know I'm a

2559.48 --> 2565.8
bit late today but I am very focused

2562.8 --> 2565.8
though

2599.72 --> 2604.5989999999997
late night

2602.079 --> 2606.599
yeah now Alex Jones did like this

2604.599 --> 2609.96
emergency stream with like the entire

2606.599 --> 2609.96
team like everybody was

2612.0 --> 2616.96
there and they called it the last

2614.559 --> 2621.0400000000004
broadcast and it got really emotional

2616.96 --> 2621.04
and I got pulled along in that emotions

2622.16 --> 2627.319
too although I do believe it'll be all

2627.44 --> 2634.8
right it's just man that he's just being

2631.16 --> 2639.5589999999997
personally trolled and nagged really

2634.8 --> 2642.599
bad it's like to him it's like if if

2639.559 --> 2646.6800000000003
like the nasty ass trolls that I get

2642.599 --> 2649.6400000000003
like move in and just like yeah we're

2646.68 --> 2651.52
going to put a lock on your door you

2649.64 --> 2654.839
can't go in your own apartment anymore I

2651.52 --> 2654.839
mean it's almost like

2656.52 --> 2660.16
that yeah infow

2661.24 --> 2667.68
Wars some guy that's like still tied in

2665.24 --> 2669.64
with the whole mock trial that Al Jones

2667.68 --> 2672.2799999999997
went through a while

2669.64 --> 2675.16
ago basically said like yeah we're going

2672.28 --> 2677.4
to put locks on the infowar studio so

2675.16 --> 2682.5589999999997
you can't get it anymore

2677.4 --> 2682.559
and it's all illegal all of

2686.4 --> 2692.319
it but it's just the bullying of it just

2689.76 --> 2694.6800000000003
really got to Alex and he just he got

2692.319 --> 2697.8
really emotional and really pissed off

2694.68 --> 2702.319
I've never heard so many F bombs roll

2697.8 --> 2704.76
out like the f bomb per minute scale was

2702.319 --> 2704.7599999999998
off the

2704.92 --> 2711.0
charts at one time I think he said the f

2707.64 --> 2714.319
bomb like 20 times within one minute he

2711.0 --> 2714.319
was so [ __ ] pissed

2716.839 --> 2724.2799999999997
off but I mean I feel

2720.24 --> 2727.319
it Infowars is his

2724.28 --> 2730.1600000000003
ship it's like if Captain Jan w would be

2727.319 --> 2730.16
forced to leave

2733.68 --> 2739.1189999999997
Voyager so I totally get it and I really

2736.839 --> 2741.599
hope that he is actually getting massive

2739.119 --> 2743.6800000000003
support I'm also kind of worried for the

2741.599 --> 2746.0
long run about the infowar store because

2743.68 --> 2748.48
there are really unique products and I

2746.0 --> 2752.0
don't know if if something like this

2748.48 --> 2754.359
goes through if they will still be

2752.0 --> 2757.8
available was it the government no

2754.359 --> 2760.5989999999997
lawyer [ __ ] not the government the the

2757.8 --> 2764.48
government can't do anything Alex didn't

2760.599 --> 2769.319
do anything wrong like nothing he's done

2764.48 --> 2772.0
nothing wrong absolutely nothing nothing

2769.319 --> 2772.0
nothing

2773.319 --> 2780.04
nothing except be too

2777.2 --> 2784.96
loud be

2780.04 --> 2784.96
barded he's kind of barded

2785.119 --> 2790.839
and pigheaded and that kind but he's

2788.319 --> 2792.68
done legally he's done nothing wrong

2790.839 --> 2795.44
absolutely

2792.68 --> 2798.2799999999997
nothing so it's just a bunch of lawyer

2795.44 --> 2798.28
bullying

2799.48 --> 2804.52
crap the same [ __ ] as what happened to

2802.319 --> 2807.4
Trump

2804.52 --> 2809.52
recently like that stuff is Si very

2807.4 --> 2812.4
similar to what Alex Jones went

2809.52 --> 2813.88
through just nonsense trials with

2812.4 --> 2815.839
nonsense lawyers and they're just a

2813.88 --> 2820.079
bunch of bullies and they all they want

2815.839 --> 2820.0789999999997
is just to shut down the

2824.44 --> 2830.359
operations who were dude Stephen Jarvis

2827.559 --> 2833.0
who the hell how the hell would I

2830.359 --> 2835.119
know who are the lawyers connected to

2833.0 --> 2840.359
some some

2835.119 --> 2844.7200000000003
stupid FBI group or some woke government

2840.359 --> 2844.72
operatus I don't know

2853.92 --> 2859.28
I don't know man it's like Sandy Hook

2856.599 --> 2862.599
connected lawyers or something like that

2859.28 --> 2865.599
it's it's a mess and these people are

2862.599 --> 2865.599
vile

2887.28 --> 2894.48
but I mean he named names and everything

2889.839 --> 2894.48
so it's it's out in the open

2903.29 --> 2906.36
[Music]

2911.319 --> 2916.52
the guy is some kind of deep state

2913.24 --> 2918.72
grabler lawyer like that very much like

2916.52 --> 2918.72
a

2931.68 --> 2937.04
grabler yeah as for the relative density

2934.64 --> 2939.64
track yeah if anybody has any more

2937.04 --> 2942.48
questions or one more clarification I'd

2939.64 --> 2942.48
be happy to

2955.52 --> 2959.24
oblige but I think I made the main

2957.88 --> 2961.96
points clear

2959.24 --> 2965.4399999999996
enough I

2961.96 --> 2969.52
hope right that relative

2965.44 --> 2972.92
density the standard relative density is

2969.52 --> 2972.92
within a medium that

2974.0 --> 2979.88
stationary which would include the realm

2977.319 --> 2983.599
the out in the open realm

2979.88 --> 2988.44
like it's stationary that's where it

2983.599 --> 2991.04
works as soon as you have some medium

2988.44 --> 2994.359
move then relative

2991.04 --> 2997.5589999999997
density displacement axis is going to

2994.359 --> 2999.799
shift accordingly

2997.559 --> 3002.2000000000003
in accordance to the movement of the

2999.799 --> 3002.2
moving

3025.64 --> 3029.68
medium for

3041.36 --> 3044.489
[Music]

3065.64 --> 3068.64
right

3115.48 --> 3118.52
hey kumu virus

3123.16 --> 3128.64
first day with power what yet no

3125.64 --> 3128.64
electricity

3129.04 --> 3133.64
huh wait since Tuesday

3135.04 --> 3140.48
damn half a week without electricity

3145.52 --> 3149.48
h for

3203.16 --> 3207.2
so yeah I just want some feedback from

3205.68 --> 3209.0789999999997
through the furnace who basically

3207.2 --> 3212.1189999999997
started this question about relative

3209.079 --> 3214.7200000000003
density I want to know if he if he's

3212.119 --> 3216.7200000000003
satisfied about understanding the

3214.72 --> 3219.4399999999996
relative density system now with

3216.72 --> 3219.4399999999996
everything that I've

3220.72 --> 3225.3999999999996
said if he's still there

3227.73 --> 3230.84
[Music]

3249.28 --> 3256.559
that's why P power line should go

3252.559 --> 3256.559
underground yeah

3284.04 --> 3290.52
you know how density towers work with

3286.119 --> 3294.7200000000003
fluids are gases including in that

3290.52 --> 3300.2
yeah they are

3294.72 --> 3304.839
but gases don't form layers

3300.2 --> 3307.72
though so at first if they are separated

3304.839 --> 3309.48
they will tend to form layers like if

3307.72 --> 3312.359
you put them in a centri fuge or

3309.48 --> 3316.96
whatever but here's the weird thing

3312.359 --> 3320.7599999999998
eventually gases will become mixing in

3316.96 --> 3324.2400000000002
despite the tendency of layering as they

3320.76 --> 3327.44
are still like homogeneous gases they

3324.24 --> 3330.0
will move in all directions despite mix

3327.44 --> 3332.4
in and then eventually it will turn into

3330.0 --> 3336.44
an inhomogeneous

3332.4 --> 3338.44
mesh so yeah as a separated gas and

3336.44 --> 3341.4
another separated gas they will have

3338.44 --> 3343.2000000000003
layering Tendencies but over time they

3341.4 --> 3350.039
do mix

3343.2 --> 3350.0389999999998
in so they gases can't be kept in layers

3357.52 --> 3362.88
do most flat earthers believe in the

3360.079 --> 3365.44
relative density I think so yeah I think

3362.88 --> 3368.319
that that piece of knowledge has pretty

3365.44 --> 3372.2400000000002
much gone

3368.319 --> 3372.24
around like after

3373.0 --> 3379.4
2017 I think it is widely uh understood

3376.16 --> 3379.3999999999996
and accepted

3394.87 --> 3398.0899999999997
[Music]

3411.319 --> 3417.359
the law of relative density dis okay

3414.119 --> 3420.48
sure you can call it a law

3417.359 --> 3420.48
arguably that is

3424.839 --> 3431.72
correct about what about is it a law a

3429.359 --> 3435.0389999999998
law of nature something that happens

3431.72 --> 3437.319
always without exception under any

3435.039 --> 3439.6800000000003
circumstance that's what makes it a law

3437.319 --> 3439.68
Kuma

3440.119 --> 3448.1600000000003
virus it never doesn't

3443.96 --> 3448.16
happen it always applies

3454.319 --> 3460.599
so yeah you could arguably say relative

3457.16 --> 3463.92
density disequilibrium law you can

3460.599 --> 3463.92
technically say that and be

3466.799 --> 3474.0389999999998
correct but in a way it's

3470.119 --> 3478.48
just more satisfying to just

3474.039 --> 3480.6400000000003
claim science cuz when do you even have

3478.48 --> 3483.799
that opportunity out there now to

3480.64 --> 3486.799
actually properly claim science to

3483.799 --> 3490.92
something that indirectly relates to the

3486.799 --> 3494.319
Flat Earth I mean that's like you got to

3490.92 --> 3496.2400000000002
do it all these bards everywhere oh

3494.319 --> 3497.5589999999997
science this this science like they

3496.24 --> 3498.9599999999996
don't even know what science mean

3497.559 --> 3500.6400000000003
they're not proving the cause of a

3498.96 --> 3504.16
naturally occurring

3500.64 --> 3508.2
phenomenon yeah relative

3504.16 --> 3511.92
density is science so it's like a luxury

3508.2 --> 3514.24
to be able to say now it's scientific I

3511.92 --> 3516.2400000000002
mean yeah it's a law because it's so

3514.24 --> 3519.4399999999996
absolutely true that you can call it

3516.24 --> 3524.5989999999997
natural law but to call it scientific is

3519.44 --> 3524.599
like more gratifying wouldn't you say

3528.039 --> 3533.3590000000004
so and it is

3530.44 --> 3537.839
scientific it is so scientific that you

3533.359 --> 3537.839
can call it a natural law

3540.72 --> 3546.839
it's just more fun to call it a science

3595.52 --> 3602.119
what would the the law say

3598.44 --> 3604.839
happens less dense

3602.119 --> 3606.88
objects go up in a St this is

3604.839 --> 3608.7599999999998
specifically in a stationary situation

3606.88 --> 3613.039
less dance thing go

3608.76 --> 3613.039
up more Dan things go

3623.4 --> 3629.0
down yeah clear you can just tell them

3626.0 --> 3632.2
kumu virus is just having it's just

3629.0 --> 3635.48
little accidental misunderstanding

3632.2 --> 3638.16
that's going to be systemic and eternal

3635.48 --> 3640.079
it's just just has a bit of trouble

3638.16 --> 3644.72
understanding that thing that completely

3640.079 --> 3648.6800000000003
breaks his globed hard conviction so

3644.72 --> 3654.0
excuse him if he doesn't get get it that

3648.68 --> 3654.0
thing which is like abundantly clarified

3678.559 --> 3684.3190000000004
there's no problem yeah we know there's

3681.72 --> 3686.48
no problem there's only a problem if you

3684.319 --> 3690.359
believe the Earth is a globe that's

3686.48 --> 3693.839
where the problems come in lots of

3690.359 --> 3693.839
them be right

3714.839 --> 3718.88
back e

3775.2 --> 3777.839
h

3779.839 --> 3784.66
oh here Kuma goes again with the [ __ ]

3782.44 --> 3786.039
math shut that math up your ass

3784.66 --> 3789.92
[Music]

3786.039 --> 3793.079
dude [ __ ] math I just describe it

3789.92 --> 3795.76
describe it it works you figure out the

3793.079 --> 3801.4
math yeah I mean you could create math

3795.76 --> 3801.4
for it you go do that you're such a math

3801.599 --> 3809.4
genius like you make the math akumu you

3805.4 --> 3812.0
just make the math you do it if you're

3809.4 --> 3815.559
so good at it why don't you make the

3812.0 --> 3815.559
math for it

3838.76 --> 3842.559
no Steven Jarvis math does not rule math

3841.64 --> 3845.1189999999997
only

3842.559 --> 3847.3190000000004
describes hey seeking star water good to

3845.119 --> 3847.319
see

3848.44 --> 3852.96
you it's been a while

3872.76 --> 3875.3590000000004
how you doing

3875.88 --> 3880.76
girl hope everything is all right

3921.119 --> 3927.6400000000003
Everything Changes

3923.72 --> 3927.64
okay I'm glad you're doing okay

3930.44 --> 3935.799
okay does the equation become

3938.96 --> 3941.96
experiment

3948.88 --> 3953.96
no now the

3950.96 --> 3953.96
hypothesis

3954.2 --> 3958.2
formulation comes before the

3958.599 --> 3963.2000000000003
experiment there's not an equation

3961.119 --> 3965.76
there's nothing to do with equation it's

3963.2 --> 3972.0789999999997
the formulation of the

3965.76 --> 3972.079
hypothesis hypothesis test then pre

3976.799 --> 3979.799
proceeds

3984.559 --> 3988.559
no for

4016.92 --> 4022.64
that's no they don't auma virus you're

4020.279 --> 4022.64
just

4044.52 --> 4048.48
wrong for

4089.68 --> 4095.16
that's right seeing star water indeed is

4092.64 --> 4095.16
level in

4096.839 --> 4103.679
stationary and you don't need math to

4099.759 --> 4103.679
describe that for you

4107.92 --> 4114.679
I mean let let's just ignore Akuma virus

4111.279 --> 4116.4400000000005
he's just blabbering on his nonsense now

4114.679 --> 4121.52
confing

4116.44 --> 4126.08
things to try and get his way in his

4121.52 --> 4126.080000000001
head it's better to just ignore him

4126.719 --> 4131.799
now otherwise he's just going to blabber

4129.199 --> 4134.96
on incessantly until I have to kick him

4131.799 --> 4136.679
out cuz he won't shut the hell up I know

4134.96 --> 4140.4
that's what happens that's like the law

4136.679 --> 4140.4
of a kumu virus

4188.199 --> 4192.799
what what is that about

4209.239 --> 4213.718999999999
I'll just stick to describing it this

4211.76 --> 4216.719
just works perfectly fine no math

4213.719 --> 4216.719
necessary

4231.76 --> 4236.76
what why are you repeating the exact

4234.0 --> 4236.76
same sentence

4240.719 --> 4247.52
clearly what do you mean better it's

4243.4 --> 4250.32
literally identical to what you posted

4247.52 --> 4255.080000000001
before Oh wait except for the word

4250.32 --> 4255.08
object you changed it with medium

4259.96 --> 4264.719
see akum virus just G as soon as you're

4262.6 --> 4267.52
going to do the math aumu virus is there

4264.719 --> 4269.32
to tell you no it's not good enough

4267.52 --> 4273.0
right because it can never be good

4269.32 --> 4275.639999999999
enough relative density can't be

4273.0 --> 4277.719
finalized in his head because then the

4275.64 --> 4279.4800000000005
Earth is in the globe then it's all

4277.719 --> 4282.4
wrong everything is wrong everything

4279.48 --> 4286.639999999999
that he believes in is wrong so that's

4282.4 --> 4289.44
why he's going to the math

4286.64 --> 4292.400000000001
so that he can disapprove of whatever

4289.44 --> 4296.12
you're going to attempt

4292.4 --> 4298.32
to do with it to formulate relative

4296.12 --> 4300.88
density mathematically it's always going

4298.32 --> 4305.239
to be wrong because

4300.88 --> 4308.719
then he can keep his open mind about

4305.239 --> 4312.08
relative density not being real and

4308.719 --> 4316.159
[ __ ] Ballard Earth being a real with

4312.08 --> 4316.159
[ __ ] [ __ ] gravity

4338.4 --> 4343.5199999999995
yeah that's why he draws things into

4340.96 --> 4346.36
math because then he can just say no

4343.52 --> 4351.4400000000005
you're wrong

4346.36 --> 4351.44
and just keep you bickering about the

4371.88 --> 4376.32
math hello Amberton

4379.679 --> 4388.12
C did you cover where relative density

4383.88 --> 4391.84
gets the direction from

4388.12 --> 4394.28
what what do you mean where it got it

4391.84 --> 4399.639
from

4394.28 --> 4403.0
no it just describes what it is not why

4399.639 --> 4407.0
it is yeah relative density Theory

4403.0 --> 4408.36
doesn't tell you why why it just tells

4407.0 --> 4413.199
you

4408.36 --> 4417.839999999999
what yeah the why could go [ __ ]

4413.199 --> 4420.839999999999
himself it just just tells you what

4417.84 --> 4423.4400000000005
happens yeah that makes it scientific

4420.84 --> 4426.2390000000005
that makes it natural

4423.44 --> 4430.239
law because it's accurate yeah it

4426.239 --> 4432.239
doesn't tell you why it's not a whining

4430.239 --> 4437.04
shitty

4432.239 --> 4437.04
Theory it just tells you what

4469.04 --> 4472.679
how does the Direction come

4474.36 --> 4479.36
about less dense object in the

4476.8 --> 4483.320000000001
stationary medium go up more dense

4479.36 --> 4483.32
object in the stationary medium go

4488.719 --> 4495.84
down how does it come about well that's

4491.88 --> 4495.84
the same as why

4497.32 --> 4502.719
it just does that's what

4500.52 --> 4505.040000000001
happens less dense things in the

4502.719 --> 4508.08
stationary medium go up more dense

4505.04 --> 4512.84
things in the stationary medium go

4508.08 --> 4515.92
down how why who gives a [ __ ] that just

4512.84 --> 4518.639
happens it happens it happens always

4515.92 --> 4520.76
that's what always happens I don't care

4518.639 --> 4523.76
why it happens I just know that's what

4520.76 --> 4523.76
happens

4535.159 --> 4540.96
up and down relative to

4537.96 --> 4540.96
what

4541.08 --> 4544.88
no there is no

4549.52 --> 4556.159000000001
relative in this realm up and down are

4552.52 --> 4558.6
absolute there is no relativity

4556.159 --> 4562.08
yeah there's no relative

4558.6 --> 4567.04
up relative up and relative down only

4562.08 --> 4570.48
exists in bardia world living on a

4567.04 --> 4572.84
sphere it doesn't actually exist in

4570.48 --> 4576.199
physical

4572.84 --> 4581.2390000000005
reality an enclosed

4576.199 --> 4586.12
realm with a geometrically flat

4581.239 --> 4586.12
orientated surface of Earth

4614.6 --> 4620.159000000001
that's does help you no it doesn't help

4616.679 --> 4623.159
you akumu virus he's trying to clearly

4620.159 --> 4626.28
is trying to help you yeah this is not

4623.159 --> 4629.199
about him being helped yeah go [ __ ]

4626.28 --> 4632.599999999999
yourself akumu virus you're the Ballard

4629.199 --> 4635.5199999999995
that can't understand this rudimentary

4632.6 --> 4640.1990000000005
concept not Clary Clary doesn't have any

4635.52 --> 4640.1990000000005
problem understanding it whatsoever it's

4640.32 --> 4646.84
you don't sneakily try to reverse the

4644.44 --> 4646.839999999999
roles

4663.04 --> 4666.8
here what do you mean I'm not

4665.48 --> 4671.04
understanding your

4666.8 --> 4673.4800000000005
question up and down relative to what to

4671.04 --> 4676.44
everything to everything up and down

4673.48 --> 4681.36
relative to everything

4676.44 --> 4681.36
yeah Universal Cardinal up Cardinal

4687.88 --> 4697.28
down every up parallel to every other up

4691.92 --> 4697.28
every down parallel to every other down

4712.76 --> 4715.76
that

4721.62 --> 4724.689
[Music]

4727.99 --> 4731.1089999999995
[Music]

4757.44 --> 4764.4
family low relative Den that's funny one

4760.96 --> 4764.4
that that's funny

4772.679 --> 4775.679
that

4814.6 --> 4821.159000000001
right so yeah Amberton cbury hope I

4817.32 --> 4821.159
clarified that

4824.88 --> 4827.76
I answered your

4828.159 --> 4836.36
question yeah Cardinal up Cardinal down

4832.12 --> 4836.36
absolute absolute Universal

4853.639 --> 4856.639
Direction

4883.56 --> 4886.56
e

4913.52 --> 4917.56
for for

4948.87 --> 4952.09
[Applause]

4968.48 --> 4973.32
I guess today's show title is going to

4971.08 --> 4976.4
be all about relative density I mean

4973.32 --> 4978.759999999999
since we're talking about that

4976.4 --> 4978.759999999999
the

4978.96 --> 4982.719
last one and a half

4984.639 --> 4988.679
hour I seem to be getting upset am I

4987.719 --> 4992.8
getting

4988.679 --> 4992.8
upset oh my God I'm so

4993.08 --> 4999.159
upset hey Richard G what are you doing

4996.159 --> 4999.159
here

5009.28 --> 5012.599999999999
hello clutch good to see

5029.52 --> 5036.4400000000005
you okay fine Richard G you you could do

5032.52 --> 5036.4400000000005
whatever you want man

5063.32 --> 5066.32
for

5093.32 --> 5097.36
e e

5135.4 --> 5138.599999999999
all right anyway hope everybody's

5137.0 --> 5144.199
enjoying the show if you are don't

5138.6 --> 5144.1990000000005
forget to Rogan it up and share it

5183.48 --> 5186.239
all right there

5213.239 --> 5217.159
m for

5273.119 --> 5277.159
okay for

5312.88 --> 5318.6
you could smell the relative density

5315.6 --> 5318.6
talk

5331.199 --> 5335.638999999999
okay well that's mostly because of

5333.4 --> 5339.638999999999
through the first is bringing it up in

5335.639 --> 5341.2390000000005
relation to Dell's show no doubt from

5339.639 --> 5343.52
yesterday because that's the only thing

5341.239 --> 5347.599999999999
he ever talks

5343.52 --> 5350.320000000001
about about how relative density is all

5347.6 --> 5353.639
nonsense cuz look I threw a bottle and

5350.32 --> 5356.639
it relative density doesn't apply to the

5353.639 --> 5362.28
bottle even though

5356.639 --> 5364.4800000000005
that's not a stationary medium but yeah

5362.28 --> 5367.88
I mean

5364.48 --> 5367.879999999999
just keep ignoring that

5371.6 --> 5374.6
part

5393.04 --> 5396.04
what

5422.96 --> 5426.96
e for

5461.84 --> 5466.32
hey getting wisdom good to see you

5485.96 --> 5492.199
that's a weird question which is more

5488.76 --> 5494.4400000000005
like a fre a position to VI the world

5492.199 --> 5497.799999999999
literally know that everything is

5494.44 --> 5497.799999999999
variating degrees of

5498.239 --> 5502.839999999999
motion that's definitely more of a

5500.92 --> 5506.2390000000005
presupposition than to just think the

5502.84 --> 5508.56
world is at rest well nothing happening

5506.239 --> 5510.04
which is the world being stationary

5508.56 --> 5512.400000000001
isn't a

5510.04 --> 5515.84
claim if it's not a claim it's not a

5512.4 --> 5515.839999999999
presupposition either

5517.56 --> 5523.719
the claim would be that it is in motion

5520.76 --> 5526.08
and that claim would have to be proven

5523.719 --> 5526.08
and it

5526.56 --> 5531.280000000001
isn't so

5528.52 --> 5532.76
yeah it's much more of a presupposition

5531.28 --> 5535.08
to claim that there is some kind of

5532.76 --> 5537.76
motion to the

5535.08 --> 5540.08
realm than that's than that it is

5537.76 --> 5542.52
stationary because technically claiming

5540.08 --> 5546.32
it's stationary isn't a

5542.52 --> 5550.2390000000005
claim cu stationary indicates nothing

5546.32 --> 5550.239
happening not moving is not a

5558.08 --> 5566.719
claim that's right Earth is stationary

5561.76 --> 5566.719
isn't a claim like physics

5566.96 --> 5572.119
wise it's nothing happening there's no

5572.84 --> 5576.84
motion now you can say it's

5578.199 --> 5583.599999999999
stationary then You' be right if you

5581.8 --> 5585.8
then want to prove the contrary well

5583.6 --> 5587.56
then you have to prove it's moving

5585.8 --> 5591.159000000001
because that is a claim of something

5587.56 --> 5591.159000000001
happening you have to prove that

5602.76 --> 5606.76
then for

5655.679 --> 5661.4800000000005
what the hell does that even mean clear

5657.52 --> 5661.4800000000005
that that that's not a logical

5662.719 --> 5666.679
word for

5736.32 --> 5742.599999999999
that made no sense no it made no sense

5738.44 --> 5742.599999999999
to you because your senses are

5743.92 --> 5748.719
blocked got some Bard in the

5749.96 --> 5757.52
way yeah Earth is not spinning

5754.4 --> 5759.28
there's no Coralis deviation because air

5757.52 --> 5762.1990000000005
doesn't move in loog step with

5759.28 --> 5764.08
presupposed spinning ball Earth and

5762.199 --> 5766.638999999999
there is no constant wind in One

5764.08 --> 5766.639
Direction

5768.04 --> 5774.8
everywhere Earth is

5770.4 --> 5774.799999999999
stationary it's not spitting

5807.88 --> 5813.96
why would you think it would be wind in

5809.8 --> 5813.96
One Direction because

5815.0 --> 5819.48
the air is standing still and the Earth

5816.92 --> 5822.08
is would be spinning underneath it

5819.48 --> 5825.44
so since the spin is always going to be

5822.08 --> 5827.76
in One Direction right if it were

5825.44 --> 5829.678999999999
spinning well then the wind is going to

5827.76 --> 5830.84
stand still and have the earth move

5829.679 --> 5834.92
underneath

5830.84 --> 5836.88
it in one consistent Direction which you

5834.92 --> 5840.4800000000005
would experience on the earth as the

5836.88 --> 5840.4800000000005
wind going in One Direction

5840.679 --> 5845.36
forever I can't believe I actually need

5843.639 --> 5849.36
to explain

5845.36 --> 5852.28
that rudimentary sensory perception that

5849.36 --> 5855.4
like any six-year-old could figure out

5852.28 --> 5859.719
that I need to explain that to you after

5855.4 --> 5859.719
like eight years of hanging around Flat

5859.8 --> 5865.639
Earth that's worrisome Kuma

5871.08 --> 5876.639
virus no that's not say

5874.119 --> 5880.5199999999995
gal is is a cal the direction it has

5876.639 --> 5880.52
absolutely nothing to do with one

5893.04 --> 5897.84
another I can't believe I have to

5895.52 --> 5901.2390000000005
explain this to

5897.84 --> 5904.2390000000005
you this is really

5901.239 --> 5908.04
damning like even for a b [ __ ] like

5904.239 --> 5908.04
yourself that's really

5910.56 --> 5917.0
damning you've had like hundreds of

5914.08 --> 5920.719
hours of debate about this subject how

5917.0 --> 5925.32
can you not get this

5920.719 --> 5930.04
rudimentary detail right after hundreds

5925.32 --> 5930.04
of hours of debating the subject

5950.239 --> 5953.239
h

5965.32 --> 5968.4
okay Shan G

5973.04 --> 5977.119
sure density is specific gravity well

5975.92 --> 5980.0
that's

5977.119 --> 5982.28
cool you could definitely say that

5980.0 --> 5982.28
that's

5992.32 --> 5995.32
fine

6022.32 --> 6026.28
e for

6032.98 --> 6036.219999999999
[Music]

6078.52 --> 6081.52
he

6084.48 --> 6089.598999999999
but saying that want should

6090.239 --> 6095.08
what that wind should be in One

6093.48 --> 6098.32
Direction on the spinning globe is

6095.08 --> 6098.32
beyond oh my

6101.679 --> 6106.96
god

6104.32 --> 6109.159
really that's beyond you you can't

6106.96 --> 6111.84
imagine that the Earth the ball Earth

6109.159 --> 6113.879999999999
would be spinning underneath the air the

6111.84 --> 6115.4400000000005
air that stands still

6113.88 --> 6117.679
while the Earth is spinning underneath

6115.44 --> 6120.44
and that that if you're standing on the

6117.679 --> 6123.679
spinning Earth that you would experience

6120.44 --> 6126.48
that air standing still underneath which

6123.679 --> 6130.1990000000005
the ball spins on which you stand that

6126.48 --> 6135.159
you would experience that as

6130.199 --> 6138.839999999999
wind like getting pushed through the

6135.159 --> 6141.44
wind you experiences it wind of the air

6138.84 --> 6144.32
that's actually standing

6141.44 --> 6146.678999999999
still underneath wind the ball Earth

6144.32 --> 6150.28
spins I mean that's too hard for you to

6146.679 --> 6153.52
comprehend that

6150.28 --> 6156.639
really you've never sat on a

6153.52 --> 6159.76
roundabout and felt the

6156.639 --> 6161.52
wind continually blowing in your face as

6159.76 --> 6163.76
you moved on the

6161.52 --> 6167.0
roundabout yeah you experienced that

6163.76 --> 6168.56
wind continually even though the wind

6167.0 --> 6170.56
could have it could have been perfectly

6168.56 --> 6173.56
wind still that

6170.56 --> 6176.52
day but because you're on the roundabout

6173.56 --> 6178.400000000001
yeah wind gets pushed in your face now

6176.52 --> 6180.679
yeah that's the same situation as a

6178.4 --> 6183.679
spinning ball

6180.679 --> 6186.04
Earth the air would be standing still or

6183.679 --> 6188.0
doing whatever going a bit this way that

6186.04 --> 6190.119
way but the Earth would definitely be

6188.0 --> 6192.28
spinning underneath it so if you'd be on

6190.119 --> 6194.639
that Earth just as you would be on the

6192.28 --> 6195.599
roundabout where while the air is still

6194.639 --> 6198.52
around

6195.599 --> 6200.4400000000005
you you're moving on the roundabout the

6198.52 --> 6202.76
wind is going to push in your face well

6200.44 --> 6206.119
so will it push in your face when you

6202.76 --> 6206.119000000001
stand on the spinning ball

6207.0 --> 6214.48
Earth is it that hard to to imagine this

6212.32 --> 6214.48
come

6224.88 --> 6231.119
on the buyy for yeah sure y

6231.48 --> 6239.36
sure you keep moving the gravity

6234.96 --> 6241.719
nonsense in there it's Superfluous

6239.36 --> 6245.239
yeah specific

6241.719 --> 6248.52
gravity doesn't have actual gravity and

6245.239 --> 6248.5199999999995
it's just named that

6254.52 --> 6261.040000000001
way right call it density Force buoyancy

6258.32 --> 6263.44
Force it's it doesn't really matter it's

6261.04 --> 6265.679
relative density disequilibrium it's a

6263.44 --> 6266.839999999999
disequilibrium force of the object with

6265.679 --> 6270.08
the

6266.84 --> 6273.04
medium now you could call that buoyancy

6270.08 --> 6277.8
force or density force all you

6273.04 --> 6281.119
like what it is is this equilibrium

6277.8 --> 6284.400000000001
force of the object with the

6281.119 --> 6287.4
medium That's The Binding consistent

6284.4 --> 6287.4
Factor

6306.8 --> 6312.719
yeah go you're just deluding yourself

6310.36 --> 6315.4
it's hard to imagine

6312.719 --> 6317.36
what that a spinning ball Earth would

6315.4 --> 6320.32
work in a certain

6317.36 --> 6322.0
way when in reality that's not happening

6320.32 --> 6325.88
or that's just too hard for you to

6322.0 --> 6328.52
imagine you can imagine a ball Earth if

6325.88 --> 6330.400000000001
that imagination would result into

6328.52 --> 6332.4800000000005
exactly what you're experiencing out

6330.4 --> 6335.199
there AUM virus is that the only

6332.48 --> 6337.44
imagination you can have so you

6335.199 --> 6341.239
technically can't imagine what it is

6337.44 --> 6341.239
like to be on the spinning ball Earth

6341.639 --> 6348.88
then you can't imagine anything you can

6345.0 --> 6351.239
only try to figure out a

6348.88 --> 6354.92
justification of why it's not the way

6351.239 --> 6354.919999999999
it's supposed to be

6358.08 --> 6361.96
you rather not imagine anything

6364.88 --> 6372.28
yeah I bet you

6368.52 --> 6376.080000000001
don't unless it's horror yeah well guess

6372.28 --> 6376.08
what Earth is flat

6385.52 --> 6390.96
flat stationary enclosed it's all very

6391.08 --> 6397.239
simple not a spinning ball

6394.28 --> 6401.119
Earth and yeah if you can't figure out

6397.239 --> 6404.959999999999
natural consequences of claims then

6401.119 --> 6407.0
yeah you can't imagine it you can't

6404.96 --> 6409.199
imagine how it's supposed to be on a

6407.0 --> 6411.56
spinning ball Earth so you never have to

6409.199 --> 6413.4
worry about figuring out that you're not

6411.56 --> 6418.04
on a spinning ball Earth

6413.4 --> 6418.04
then how very convenient

6454.84 --> 6461.96
yeah keep projecting your hor [ __ ] a

6458.84 --> 6464.28
virus the best thing about it is not no

6461.96 --> 6465.679
it is simple it's really simple that's

6464.28 --> 6468.28
the best thing about

6465.679 --> 6470.679
it that's the most ridiculous thing

6468.28 --> 6472.239
about the globe is that if you believe

6470.679 --> 6475.719
it you're going to turn everything

6472.239 --> 6478.239
inside out just to hold on to your glob

6475.719 --> 6480.44
belief you're going to project all your

6478.239 --> 6482.759999999999
predicament of your position your

6480.44 --> 6484.32
philosophical Vantage Point your claims

6482.76 --> 6487.320000000001
onto Flat

6484.32 --> 6487.32
Earth

6487.96 --> 6493.0
right oh Flat Earth is complicated but

6490.719 --> 6495.56
the ball is really simple no it isn't

6493.0 --> 6498.96
the ball is ridiculously

6495.56 --> 6501.56
convoluted it's not happening everything

6498.96 --> 6505.08
that you actually need is missing and

6501.56 --> 6507.0
all you do is end up trying to negate

6505.08 --> 6508.679
all the logical consequences of the

6507.0 --> 6510.8
Earth being a spinning

6508.679 --> 6514.4
ball

6510.8 --> 6516.679
to turn it into what the Earth actually

6514.4 --> 6519.04
is which is flat and

6516.679 --> 6523.2390000000005
stationary

6519.04 --> 6525.32
yeah you undo the curvature with optim

6523.239 --> 6527.5199999999995
Optical

6525.32 --> 6529.92
minations Optical Wizardry called

6527.52 --> 6533.080000000001
terrestrial

6529.92 --> 6535.639
refraction you undo spinning

6533.08 --> 6537.5199999999995
consequences by claiming air moves in

6535.639 --> 6539.119
lock step everything moves in lock step

6537.52 --> 6540.52
and even if you don't claim that then

6539.119 --> 6541.92
you just don't have any solution

6540.52 --> 6543.400000000001
whatsoever you don't know what the [ __ ]

6541.92 --> 6546.4400000000005
you're trying to imagine you're not

6543.4 --> 6548.48
really capable of imagining it but most

6546.44 --> 6550.239
Anti flat earthers do though they just

6548.48 --> 6551.799999999999
think no no everything is perfectly

6550.239 --> 6553.5599999999995
still because it's all moving in lock

6551.8 --> 6554.52
step even though air doesn't move in

6553.56 --> 6557.96
lock

6554.52 --> 6560.96
step doesn't have any momentum can't do

6557.96 --> 6560.96
that

6564.719 --> 6571.159
yeah and you imagine Air Gases to be

6568.84 --> 6573.56
fluid so that you can imagine them

6571.159 --> 6576.08
laying on top of layers up on top of

6573.56 --> 6580.320000000001
layers they're right next to a vacuum to

6576.08 --> 6580.32
justify an open system for ball

6581.08 --> 6589.04
Earth so

6584.04 --> 6589.04
everything everything about reality you

6590.599 --> 6595.88
imagine it's all imagination

6593.199 --> 6598.28
just to justify why the logical

6595.88 --> 6600.4800000000005
consequences of a spinning ball Earth

6598.28 --> 6603.92
claim outer space

6600.48 --> 6605.959999999999
vacuum isn't happening why none of those

6603.92 --> 6608.4400000000005
things you should be witnessing is

6605.96 --> 6608.44
actually

6621.639 --> 6624.639
happening

6650.32 --> 6655.599
[Music]

6651.639 --> 6655.599
for e

6657.27 --> 6660.479
[Music]

6689.76 --> 6693.679
now we're not gaslighting your AUM virus

6691.88 --> 6696.32
you're gaslighting

6693.679 --> 6700.04
yourself just a

6696.32 --> 6702.199
fractal spiral of denial back and forth

6700.04 --> 6705.119
yes no yes no yes no you're not doing

6702.199 --> 6707.5199999999995
nothing total solop cystic reversal like

6705.119 --> 6710.44
nothing is

6707.52 --> 6712.280000000001
real you don't do anything you don't

6710.44 --> 6713.5599999999995
believe anything you don't understand

6712.28 --> 6715.5599999999995
anything

6713.56 --> 6718.76
but it's a ball

6715.56 --> 6723.1990000000005
right yeah yeah it's called total

6718.76 --> 6725.320000000001
solipsistic reversal or denial based

6723.199 --> 6727.4
inward spiraling that's what you're

6725.32 --> 6732.159
doing right now aumu virus I've seen you

6727.4 --> 6737.199
do it a lot you've done that a

6732.159 --> 6741.638999999999
lot I can describe the Motions of your

6737.199 --> 6741.638999999999
actions very accurately

6751.74 --> 6754.7699999999995
[Music]

6756.48 --> 6759.04
yeah that's

6759.84 --> 6768.0
right telling you what's on your head no

6763.28 --> 6768.0
I'm just telling you how you

6768.679 --> 6775.92
behave the decisions you make

6773.159 --> 6778.719
within your current reasoning and the

6775.92 --> 6781.079
reasoning why why you take those

6778.719 --> 6782.76
decisions I know exactly how that works

6781.079 --> 6786.719
and it has nothing to do with

6782.76 --> 6792.2390000000005
gaslighting it's just describing very

6786.719 --> 6792.2390000000005
predictable and repeating Behavior auma

6792.4 --> 6799.679
virus I'm merely describing you right

6796.8 --> 6802.92
just think of it as math I'm just using

6799.679 --> 6806.0
words to describe you I'm not telling

6802.92 --> 6807.8
you anything I'm not telling you to do

6806.0 --> 6811.199
anything I'm not telling you to believe

6807.8 --> 6813.88
anything I'm just telling you what

6811.199 --> 6816.879999999999
you're doing or rather telling other

6813.88 --> 6820.84
people what you're doing describing your

6816.88 --> 6824.4400000000005
behavior like math except I'm using

6820.84 --> 6826.52
words I'm not gaslighting you like I

6824.44 --> 6829.239
don't have any hopes that any

6826.52 --> 6833.0
communication towards you at this point

6829.239 --> 6836.04
is going to be received in any form I'm

6833.0 --> 6840.079
merely highlighting you as an object in

6836.04 --> 6841.36
my chat for study psychological study by

6840.079 --> 6845.5599999999995
other

6841.36 --> 6847.839999999999
people who can figure out your decision

6845.56 --> 6850.56
making within the conversation and

6847.84 --> 6853.0
realize the behavior that's happening

6850.56 --> 6856.0
that's what I'm doing I'm using you as a

6853.0 --> 6858.96
psychological study object yeah not

6856.0 --> 6862.88
gaslighting you describing you out in

6858.96 --> 6865.88
the open yeah you might want some

6862.88 --> 6869.32
privacy yeah well too bad you ain't got

6865.88 --> 6872.52
it yeah cuz we got you figured out we

6869.32 --> 6875.079
got you figured out for years years of

6872.52 --> 6879.400000000001
you hanging around doing this yeah

6875.079 --> 6882.5199999999995
you're absolutely predictable to the to

6879.4 --> 6885.679
the teeth to the

6882.52 --> 6888.4800000000005
microscopic level

6885.679 --> 6891.639
predictability I can tell you every turn

6888.48 --> 6894.598999999999
you're going to take every turn into

6891.639 --> 6897.679
denial in into any direction you're

6894.599 --> 6901.159000000001
taking nothing there's literally nothing

6897.679 --> 6904.88
in the [ __ ] world that you could

6901.159 --> 6904.879999999999
say that is not

6911.92 --> 6917.96
predictable

6913.76 --> 6920.4400000000005
yeah so you can keep gaslighting

6917.96 --> 6922.679
yourself you keep telling yourself oh

6920.44 --> 6924.36
I'm not predictable you can't predict me

6922.679 --> 6926.92
yeah I can I can't predict you every

6924.36 --> 6931.199
step of the way but you can keep denying

6926.92 --> 6934.04
that every step of the way yeah I can't

6931.199 --> 6938.5199999999995
make you see the truth or

6934.04 --> 6941.56
reason or restore your artificially

6938.52 --> 6944.400000000001
suppressed sensibility that you are

6941.56 --> 6946.4400000000005
choosing subconsciously to suppress I

6944.4 --> 6948.799999999999
can't do anything about that you have

6946.44 --> 6951.199
absolute control over how you perceive

6948.8 --> 6954.360000000001
reality and you can flip it inside out

6951.199 --> 6957.638999999999
all you want nobody can stop you but we

6954.36 --> 6959.719
can all see you and we can all describe

6957.639 --> 6961.56
exactly what you're doing why you're

6959.719 --> 6964.0
doing it how you're doing it and where

6961.56 --> 6967.96
you're going to go with what you're

6964.0 --> 6971.8
doing it's utterly predictable Akuma

6967.96 --> 6975.8
virus nothing that you do is

6971.8 --> 6975.8
unpredictable nothing

6983.61 --> 6986.7699999999995
[Music]

6998.48 --> 7001.678999999999
look at how nice the weather is

7001.69 --> 7004.79
[Music]

7006.76 --> 7012.400000000001
still weather's really clearing up

7009.4 --> 7012.4
awesome

7017.84 --> 7021.360000000001
even getting some sun and

7021.52 --> 7025.52
everything great

7046.44 --> 7051.96
what LG

7048.239 --> 7051.959999999999
what what are you talking

7069.079 --> 7076.36
about wow so even LSG could just guess

7073.96 --> 7076.36
your

7076.52 --> 7084.360000000001
thoughts just look at you look at how

7081.28 --> 7087.199
unbelievably predictable you are kyrus

7084.36 --> 7089.5199999999995
you literally try to trick question the

7087.199 --> 7092.44
chat by saying what am I thinking then

7089.52 --> 7095.84
and somebody actually guessed it right I

7092.44 --> 7098.799999999999
mean that's how [ __ ] unbelievably

7095.84 --> 7101.360000000001
predictable you are yeah you ask

7098.8 --> 7104.04
somebody to guess your thought and they

7101.36 --> 7106.199
actually got right that's how

7104.04 --> 7107.96
unfuckingbelievable

7106.199 --> 7110.079
predictable you

7107.96 --> 7115.04
are

7110.079 --> 7115.04
okay look at you man

7126.05 --> 7129.22
[Music]

7140.36 --> 7143.159
I mean that's

7144.88 --> 7152.0
shocking right when even your internal

7148.119 --> 7155.799999999999
mind just becomes predictable but I mean

7152.0 --> 7155.8
that is just shocking

7163.32 --> 7168.36
oh I didn't do oh go [ __ ] yourself what

7166.599 --> 7173.079
you think I'm going to let

7168.36 --> 7175.639
you do your stupid little Dosey Do run

7173.079 --> 7175.639
around

7176.0 --> 7180.0
[ __ ] no Kum

7188.679 --> 7194.599
virus

7191.04 --> 7196.679
yeah you've made a fool of

7194.599 --> 7200.119000000001
yourself and there's nothing you could

7196.679 --> 7202.639
do about it all you can do now is just

7200.119 --> 7205.639
try to piss me off more and more and

7202.639 --> 7209.56
more so that I ban you again so that

7205.639 --> 7212.32
your humiliating performance will be

7209.56 --> 7215.4800000000005
removed that's all you can do that's all

7212.32 --> 7217.639
you ever end up doing it's very

7215.48 --> 7219.718999999999
predictable it's not the first time

7217.639 --> 7222.2390000000005
you've been doing this in my chat I've

7219.719 --> 7225.679
experienced this hundreds if not

7222.239 --> 7225.678999999999
thousands of times by

7235.36 --> 7242.119
now yeah Earth it's flat stationary and

7242.599 --> 7248.28
enclosed and you can think of everything

7246.679 --> 7253.36
however you [ __ ] like it's not going

7248.28 --> 7257.36
to matter Earth is not a ball

7253.36 --> 7260.0

7955.079 --> 7964.4
perhaps the Ukrainian people the actual

7958.559 --> 7967.52
people can be saved and salvaged and

7964.4 --> 7970.04
stabilized and given room to get some

7967.52 --> 7972.119000000001
children to kind of save the Ukrainian

7970.04 --> 7973.639
people which is being th

7972.119 --> 7975.92
out

7973.639 --> 7979.639
insanely because

7975.92 --> 7979.639
of NATO

7980.88 --> 7987.4400000000005
actions yeah NATO is literally

7984.199 --> 7990.28
genociding Ukrainian people for their

7987.44 --> 7990.28
own selfish

7993.599 --> 7999.96
interests yeah I mean Russia doesn't

7996.079 --> 8002.199
want to kill ukrainians they actually

7999.96 --> 8004.4800000000005
rescue a lot of

8002.199 --> 8005.96
ukrainians a lot of soldiers whenever

8004.48 --> 8007.44
they get a chance and it's the best

8005.96 --> 8009.639
thing you could do as a Ukrainian

8007.44 --> 8012.719
Soldier yeah a lot of them

8009.639 --> 8015.76
surrender and they get

8012.719 --> 8018.8
processed and safety in Russia and like

8015.76 --> 8023.079000000001
that that's where they can live

8018.8 --> 8025.88
on cuz Russia actually doesn't want to

8023.079 --> 8025.88
kill all the

8027.119 --> 8033.079
ukrainians but they have to stop these

8030.679 --> 8037.04
anti an Russian

8033.079 --> 8039.48
Nazis that are literally like

8037.04 --> 8042.079
bombing civilian

8039.48 --> 8043.759999999999
areas that's what they have been doing

8042.079 --> 8045.558999999999
that's what they have been doing for a

8043.76 --> 8049.679
decade and they have to be

8045.559 --> 8049.679
stopped and that's what Russia is

8050.119 --> 8054.799999999999
doing they don't want to kill all the

8052.76 --> 8059.04
Ukrainian people they just want this

8054.8 --> 8062.76
[ __ ] anti-russia Nazism to stop

8059.04 --> 8062.76
that's all they're doing

8079.04 --> 8083.48
yeah but of course none of you are

8081.639 --> 8086.52
actually going to address

8083.48 --> 8092.48
that that's

8086.52 --> 8092.4800000000005
fine go blabber on with akumu virus

8102.76 --> 8105.779
[Music]

8107.0 --> 8110.0
is

8123.36 --> 8128.48
yeah but seriously just for the record I

8126.36 --> 8130.36
do not hate Ukraine I do not hate

8128.48 --> 8133.36
ukrainians I

8130.36 --> 8135.639
actually like them like I would marry a

8133.36 --> 8138.32
Ukrainian I would have kids with a

8135.639 --> 8138.32
Ukrainian

8138.559 --> 8144.599
woman that's how much I actually like

8141.599 --> 8148.159000000001
ukrainians I think that they're amazing

8144.599 --> 8148.159000000001
Unfortunately they are being

8148.44 --> 8156.079
slaughtered by NATO

8152.48 --> 8157.04
by this yeah New World Order cabal

8156.079 --> 8159.639
that's what they're doing they're

8157.04 --> 8163.84
slaughtering

8159.639 --> 8163.84
them sending them to their

8164.159 --> 8170.159
death like Russia is not just going to

8167.04 --> 8174.44
stand down just to prevent the slaughter

8170.159 --> 8176.679
of ukrainians they have to defend

8174.44 --> 8181.96
themselves right and they've offered

8176.679 --> 8185.4800000000005
peace a lot they've offered Ukraine

8181.96 --> 8188.4
peace and that peace offer would be

8185.48 --> 8195.279999999999
declined every goddamn

8188.4 --> 8195.279999999999
time by the Ukrainian leadership yeah

8216.559 --> 8221.719
I was a big fan of Po what

8262.8 --> 8267.639
yeah you know by the way you know how

8264.599 --> 8270.639000000001
much of a great leader zinski is he's so

8267.639 --> 8272.679
great that if Hitler was actually there

8270.639 --> 8275.319
the postwar

8272.679 --> 8277.559
Hitler if if those times would have

8275.319 --> 8280.92
fused you know what Hitler would

8277.559 --> 8284.88
probably [ __ ] have zinski

8280.92 --> 8290.24
assassinated because he's so incredibly

8284.88 --> 8295.639
vile and creates a terrible name for

8290.24 --> 8299.039999999999
Nazism yeah he's so unbelievably

8295.639 --> 8301.399
disgusting like Hitler would probably

8299.04 --> 8305.160000000002
like cozy up to him as like oh yeah your

8301.399 --> 8307.439
fellow Nazis and and he would probably

8305.16 --> 8309.439
just have him assassinated because he's

8307.439 --> 8313.800000000001
so [ __ ]

8309.439 --> 8317.639000000001
up yeah Hitler would reject zalinski

8313.8 --> 8322.479
because zalinski is too [ __ ]

8317.639 --> 8322.479
disgusting yeah that's the reality

8330.88 --> 8333.08
what

8333.84 --> 8338.439
Elissa not an attack I don't know what

8336.479 --> 8340.24
you're talking about attack whatever

8338.439 --> 8341.84
you're just joking around that's fine

8340.24 --> 8345.16
I'm talking about

8341.84 --> 8349.92
this political [ __ ] because some [ __ ]

8345.16 --> 8353.039999999999
[ __ ] came me my Ukraine is

8349.92 --> 8356.0
winning zinski is such a great leader I

8353.04 --> 8360.04
mean you can't be [ __ ] serious man

8356.0 --> 8360.04
you can't be [ __ ] serious

8372.0 --> 8378.16
I I think that like Vlad the Impaler was

8376.479 --> 8382.76
probably

8378.16 --> 8382.76
like a 100 times better than

8382.92 --> 8390.08
zalinski like that guy actually defeated

8386.719 --> 8392.64
his enemy would use brutality as a

8390.08 --> 8392.64
deterrent

8392.8 --> 8401.358999999999
have a strict rule yeah ziny is just

8396.92 --> 8401.359
pure corrupted disgusting

8403.08 --> 8409.8
this drenched in lies like so far like

8407.56 --> 8411.439
he probably doesn't even know how bad

8409.8 --> 8414.319
the lies are

8411.439 --> 8420.12
anymore when you lie that much like you

8414.319 --> 8420.119999999999
lose track you lose track of everything

8424.08 --> 8427.16
The Tick was AER

8430.64 --> 8433.64
than

8449.64 --> 8452.64
spoon

8479.56 --> 8483.56
for e

8526.04 --> 8529.800000000001
right anyway hope everybody's enjoying

8527.76 --> 8532.960000000001
the show don't forget to rogans it up if

8529.8 --> 8532.96
you are

8560.319 --> 8565.199999999999
it's funny by the way like how where

8563.0 --> 8569.76
that first started like I'm projecting

8565.2 --> 8569.76
my insecurities onto others

8571.92 --> 8575.399
do I do I ever do

8582.12 --> 8587.439
that I thought I was pretty upfront

8585.08 --> 8590.359
about my own

8587.439 --> 8593.64
insecurities I'm kind of honest about

8590.359 --> 8596.08
them I don't see how that me how that

8593.64 --> 8600.278999999999
could be interpreted as that I'm

8596.08 --> 8600.279
projecting it on to others

8629.439 --> 8633.399
what for

8674.96 --> 8678.08
okay so I guess that was

8686.439 --> 8692.2
it I mean I wonder if that these [ __ ]

8689.56 --> 8694.96
Ukrainian retards that just surrender to

8692.2 --> 8696.6
this hor [ __ ] they're like that too like

8694.96 --> 8698.358999999999
oh our leader is great and they just

8696.6 --> 8701.439
come in like oh we're winning we're

8698.359 --> 8704.399000000001
leader right and that's it and that's

8701.439 --> 8704.399
they just keep doing

8705.12 --> 8712.04
that they just like we're winning and

8708.24 --> 8713.359
then they just die very quickly is that

8712.04 --> 8715.279
is that how

8713.359 --> 8721.720000000001
they

8715.279 --> 8726.76
cope out there it's horrendously tragic

8721.72 --> 8726.76
wouldn't you want to cope differently

8760.64 --> 8767.319
well apparently you guys don't want to

8763.12 --> 8767.319000000001
talk about that that's fine

8789.68 --> 8791.880000000001
all

8809.24 --> 8813.199999999999
right e

8848.88 --> 8854.679999999998
see what it did there yeah proof you're

8850.76 --> 8858.56
[ __ ] out of your mind Kuma

8854.68 --> 8861.439
virus you just proved you're just a

8858.56 --> 8864.56
unbelievably delusional freak that's

8861.439 --> 8867.24
what you proved there with laughy cryy

8864.56 --> 8867.24
face

8869.12 --> 8873.160000000002
yeah for

8914.76 --> 8919.72
just a joke everything is a joke to you

8916.92 --> 8921.92
you see that's what happens like when

8919.72 --> 8925.0
there's no position that could be

8921.92 --> 8928.12
gratifying to the ego by enabling you to

8925.0 --> 8930.88
win an argument of any sort yeah then

8928.12 --> 8932.439
it's suddenly a joke of course

8930.88 --> 8935.88
I

8932.439 --> 8937.800000000001
know again another maneuver that leads

8935.88 --> 8939.24
to solop cystic reversal somebody's

8937.8 --> 8941.278999999999
going to push you on it and you're just

8939.24 --> 8945.16
going to keep going until nothing means

8941.279 --> 8948.319000000001
anything and it's all so funny to

8945.16 --> 8948.319
you we

8949.12 --> 8956.720000000001
know we know you're delusional we know

8952.68 --> 8962.04
you're in denial we know we can't make

8956.72 --> 8962.039999999999
you snap out of it we know

8989.04 --> 8992.04
for

9018.96 --> 9022.96
for for

9073.72 --> 9084.16
let's just add this just to to jab

9078.92 --> 9084.16
it just to poke a little harder

9089.27 --> 9098.199
[Music]

9147.319 --> 9153.278999999999
just trying a

9149.24 --> 9155.92
b yeah he never stops and I told you

9153.279 --> 9159.479000000001
like it's never gonna he's never gonna

9155.92 --> 9162.04
stop just keeps blabbering

9159.479 --> 9163.88
on he's just going to keep he's probably

9162.04 --> 9166.560000000001
like after I round out the show he's

9163.88 --> 9168.438999999998
just going to keep doing it just going

9166.56 --> 9170.8
to move on to some other chat and just

9168.439 --> 9172.68
like just keep going and keep going oh

9170.8 --> 9174.479
it was all a joke it's going to have to

9172.68 --> 9177.399
just tell him like oh it was all a joke

9174.479 --> 9177.399
for like an hour

9178.12 --> 9182.92
straight cuz that's what he does

9201.92 --> 9207.56
right called gaslighting yourself it's

9204.92 --> 9210.479
like oh I started an argument oh I lost

9207.56 --> 9212.72
the argument I lost it really bad now I

9210.479 --> 9214.519999999999
have to convince myself that it was all

9212.72 --> 9217.16
a joke from the

9214.52 --> 9219.560000000001
start it's called gaslighting yourself

9217.16 --> 9222.6
it's akumu does

9219.56 --> 9227.319
that like no other although others do it

9222.6 --> 9227.319
too but he really does it

9250.8 --> 9255.119999999999
in nature can we observe gas pressure

9253.2 --> 9259.12
requiring

9255.12 --> 9259.12
containment uh

9268.08 --> 9272.68
it comes out of the ground yeah but it's

9269.64 --> 9276.278999999999
all contained like you couldn't perceive

9272.68 --> 9281.24
or measure gas pressure without

9276.279 --> 9281.24
containment it's a necessary anteed

9290.16 --> 9296.52
there is no non-c

9294.24 --> 9297.96
containment like even if you want to

9296.52 --> 9300.2
simulate something like that you're

9297.96 --> 9304.08
going to need a container to create a

9300.2 --> 9306.2
vacuum in order to see how gas pressure

9304.08 --> 9308.76
behaves without a container like you

9306.2 --> 9312.12
require a container so you pretty much

9308.76 --> 9312.12
require a container for

9312.399 --> 9320.96
anything and a container has to be

9316.2 --> 9320.960000000001
there and it is there

9324.92 --> 9329.76
it's just a natural fact there's

9326.76 --> 9332.12
containment there's gas pressure

9329.76 --> 9335.92
theoretically there would not be gas

9332.12 --> 9338.240000000002
pressure without any form of

9335.92 --> 9341.2
containment and theoretically in this

9338.24 --> 9344.68
case because there is gas pressure and

9341.2 --> 9344.68
there is thus

9346.439 --> 9351.0
containment and there's no place where

9348.76 --> 9354.12
there isn't any gas

9351.0 --> 9357.24
pressure there is no such place only

9354.12 --> 9357.240000000002
such places are

9372.64 --> 9378.96
imagined [ __ ] are you talking about

9375.8 --> 9381.56
natural gas pressure doesn't need yeah

9378.96 --> 9381.56
it does

9383.8 --> 9388.039999999999
there is gas pressure because there is

9388.08 --> 9394.92
containment can't say natural gas

9391.2 --> 9398.6
pressure doesn't require containment it

9394.92 --> 9400.76
does there wouldn't be any without

9398.6 --> 9404.359
it you wouldn't even be able to

9400.76 --> 9404.359
calculate it without

9407.76 --> 9413.68
it barometric pressure that's super cute

9411.16 --> 9417.84
but barometric pressure all it does is

9413.68 --> 9420.0
compare one contained amount of pressure

9417.84 --> 9422.84
with the pressure in the

9420.0 --> 9425.76
containment of the outside

9422.84 --> 9429.04
realm it's using a

9425.76 --> 9431.279
container and its pressure to compare

9429.04 --> 9433.720000000001
the pressure in another container in

9431.279 --> 9439.439
which it resides that's what a

9433.72 --> 9439.438999999998
barometric pressure measuring system is

9441.96 --> 9446.119999999999
it's a container that compares the

9444.319 --> 9449.92
pressure inside of that container with

9446.12 --> 9449.92
the pressure inside of the great

9456.8 --> 9460.72
container it measures the pressure on

9459.08 --> 9463.0
the outside of the

9460.72 --> 9467.64
containment yeah you mean the other

9463.0 --> 9467.64
container in which the gas pressure

9467.84 --> 9473.68
is yeah you require a little container

9471.24 --> 9476.64
to compare the pressure of that little

9473.68 --> 9481.04
container with the pressure outside of

9476.64 --> 9483.56
that little container inside of the big

9481.04 --> 9485.720000000001
container because if it wasn't inside of

9483.56 --> 9489.92
a big container there wouldn't be any

9485.72 --> 9489.92
pressure to compare it

9498.439 --> 9502.479000000001
with for

9552.72 --> 9557.88
paramet pressure yeah it does what the

9555.84 --> 9560.0
[ __ ] do you think a barometric pressure

9557.88 --> 9561.08
thing is

9560.0 --> 9564.08
it's

9561.08 --> 9566.56
literally comparing the pressure in one

9564.08 --> 9571.56
container with the pressure in another

9566.56 --> 9571.56
that's the entire system of a barometric

9572.12 --> 9577.0
pressure barometer basically is what

9575.16 --> 9579.68
that's called yeah that's what a

9577.0 --> 9579.68
barometer

9581.12 --> 9586.04
is you can't just say it doesn't require

9584.0 --> 9587.96
a container it's literally the pressure

9586.04 --> 9589.6
in one container compared to the

9587.96 --> 9592.64
pressure in another container how can

9589.6 --> 9595.800000000001
you just say there's no container

9592.64 --> 9601.199999999999
there it's literally a container a

9595.8 --> 9601.199999999999
barometer is a container you [ __ ]

9603.84 --> 9606.84
[ __ ]

9618.319 --> 9622.278999999999
oh for

9662.479 --> 9667.039999999999
I mean saying that like a barometer

9664.76 --> 9669.84
doesn't require containment is like

9667.04 --> 9672.640000000001
saying that a balloon is in the

9669.84 --> 9672.64
container I

9673.88 --> 9680.358999999999
mean it's just so asinine it's tedious

9703.76 --> 9709.800000000001
the Mercury barometer only seed on one

9706.8 --> 9709.8
end

9715.12 --> 9720.92
so it's contained though yeah it's just

9718.92 --> 9723.56
an open container is that not a

9720.92 --> 9723.56
container

9724.279 --> 9729.399000000001
then is it not comparing the volume of

9728.0 --> 9732.439
one

9729.399 --> 9735.8
thing with another

9732.439 --> 9738.279
thing I mean you can't escape this diver

9735.8 --> 9741.519999999999
d Navy vet very silly that you're

9738.279 --> 9745.52
actually mve moving in to try to support

9741.52 --> 9749.439
[ __ ] akumu virus in this idiotic

9745.52 --> 9749.439
argument unbelievable

9766.04 --> 9773.84
dude like does it matter that it's an

9769.16 --> 9776.84
open container it's literally

9773.84 --> 9779.16
comparing the pressure in one container

9776.84 --> 9782.84
with the pressure in another

9779.16 --> 9785.439
container yeah except that

9782.84 --> 9787.960000000001
mercury yeah can be kept in an open

9785.439 --> 9789.960000000001
container cuz it's not going to I guess

9787.96 --> 9793.199999999999
not going to evaporate although it's

9789.96 --> 9795.919999999998
like I think they do technically seal it

9793.2 --> 9797.84
because Mercury could also evaporate and

9795.92 --> 9801.04
then it would destabilize the the

9797.84 --> 9804.72
reading and everything so

9801.04 --> 9808.479000000001
though I don't think they really keep it

9804.72 --> 9811.479
open although it can technically be

9808.479 --> 9811.479
open

9826.72 --> 9831.76
so I don't want to deal with this it's

9829.439 --> 9835.16
so [ __ ] tedious it just makes me want

9831.76 --> 9839.359
to just smack your [ __ ] head in it's

9835.16 --> 9842.399
so tedious dealing with these [ __ ]

9839.359 --> 9844.319
ballards you just can't make them

9842.399 --> 9848.88
understand

9844.319 --> 9851.64
anything rudimentary things rudimentary

9848.88 --> 9852.839999999998
physics functions you can't make them

9851.64 --> 9856.24
understand

9852.84 --> 9858.399
basic like kindergarten [ __ ] logic

9856.24 --> 9861.0
and they can't be made to understand it

9858.399 --> 9864.0
it's so [ __ ] tedious I I don't want

9861.0 --> 9864.0
to deal with this

9868.5 --> 9871.62
[Music]

9888.04 --> 9891.04
[ __ ]

9917.96 --> 9920.96
for

9947.92 --> 9950.92
for

9977.92 --> 9981.88
e for

9982.1 --> 9985.2
[Music]

10024.61 --> 10027.52
[Music]

10026.12 --> 10028.04
all right I'm going to round out the

10027.52 --> 10029.92
show

10028.04 --> 10033.12
[Music]

10029.92 --> 10035.16
soon it's just going to be this it's

10033.12 --> 10037.399000000001
good to have you in here by the way atg

10035.16 --> 10040.56
it would be very tedious without having

10037.399 --> 10042.119999999999
you here

10040.56 --> 10044.479
I probably would have rounded out an

10042.12 --> 10044.479000000001
hour

10055.399 --> 10062.24
ago yeah whatever I mean you can believe

10060.2 --> 10065.240000000002
you don't require a container to have

10062.24 --> 10068.359
pressure well you're just wrong you

10065.24 --> 10070.92
can't even calculate it without having

10068.359 --> 10073.52
exact outlines of a

10070.92 --> 10077.2
container you can't even calculate gas

10073.52 --> 10079.08
pressure without a container so just I

10077.2 --> 10082.0
don't want

10079.08 --> 10086.12
to I just don't want to continue this

10082.0 --> 10086.12
conversation it's too [ __ ]

10097.72 --> 10101.76
tedious for

10149.2 --> 10155.439
it's the reason for pressure that's

10153.2 --> 10158.880000000001
different

10155.439 --> 10160.64
no there wouldn't be any different

10158.88 --> 10164.08
pressures there wouldn't be any gas

10160.64 --> 10164.08
pressure gradient without a

10164.6 --> 10172.08
container you can't have a gas pressure

10168.359 --> 10172.08
gradient without a

10175.2 --> 10180.640000000001
container you would not have any gas

10178.2 --> 10183.399000000001
pressure without a container you can

10180.64 --> 10185.92
only have gas pressure

10183.399 --> 10189.039999999999
gradients If there is a

10185.92 --> 10193.04
container that would enable the gas to

10189.04 --> 10196.279
form pressure and then as a secondary

10193.04 --> 10199.04
effect to forming that pressure form a

10196.279 --> 10201.439
gradient you need a a

10199.04 --> 10203.960000000001
container without it there is no gas

10201.439 --> 10206.960000000001
pressure no gas pressure gradient

10203.96 --> 10206.96
nothing

10234.04 --> 10241.080000000002
the reason for pressure was physical

10237.319 --> 10244.479
restriction uh yeah yeah it

10241.08 --> 10247.6
is that is exactly what that is yeah

10244.479 --> 10250.199999999999
physical restriction containment that's

10247.6 --> 10253.319
exactly what that is is but you're just

10250.2 --> 10256.12
going to find other words that describe

10253.319 --> 10256.119999999999
the same thing

10261.96 --> 10267.72
now you can't lawyer speak your way out

10265.08 --> 10270.72
of this argument akumu virus it's

10267.72 --> 10270.72
ridiculous

10307.84 --> 10312.279
yeah ja can deal with this [ __ ] I just

10310.239 --> 10314.6
can't deal with this [ __ ] anybody else

10312.279 --> 10317.439
want to deal with this [ __ ] everybody's

10314.6 --> 10320.479000000001
just going to talk around it or like I I

10317.439 --> 10322.56
can't deal with this I can't deal with

10320.479 --> 10327.479
this level of Bal

10322.56 --> 10327.479
tartness it's too [ __ ]

10330.72 --> 10338.16
tedious ke keeps doing the same crap

10334.319 --> 10338.16
over and over again

10360.2 --> 10365.04
now it's not normal physics akumu virus

10363.04 --> 10369.960000000001
you [ __ ]

10365.04 --> 10369.960000000001
liar liar now

10371.6 --> 10377.479000000001
gas pressure requires containment you

10374.319 --> 10380.479
require containment to calculate it yeah

10377.479 --> 10382.76
barometric pressure requires

10380.479 --> 10386.76
containment without containment there is

10382.76 --> 10389.12
no barometric pressure to compare

10386.76 --> 10392.16
anything yeah barometric pressures might

10389.12 --> 10395.92
be an open system but if that open

10392.16 --> 10399.16
system is not inside of a closed system

10395.92 --> 10401.16
then there wouldn't be any pressure to

10399.16 --> 10403.96
compare anything

10401.16 --> 10406.6
to and the freaking Mercury would

10403.96 --> 10406.599999999999
probably

10408.68 --> 10411.68
evaporate

10411.72 --> 10417.76
depressurize I just can't deal with this

10414.76 --> 10417.76
crap

10425.38 --> 10428.42
[Music]

10435.279 --> 10439.880000000001
presupposing that you don't need a

10437.319 --> 10441.56
container to have pressure is not proof

10439.88 --> 10444.119999999999
that you don't need a container to have

10441.56 --> 10446.56
pressure it's a natural antecedent you

10444.12 --> 10451.160000000002
require a container to even just to be

10446.56 --> 10451.16
able to calculate [ __ ] pressure

10454.399 --> 10460.319
idiot but oh but now calculation is not

10458.04 --> 10462.720000000001
important important right oh it's only

10460.319 --> 10465.119999999999
important oh I want the math I want a

10462.72 --> 10468.399
calculation with relative density that's

10465.12 --> 10471.12
where I need the freaking math but not

10468.399 --> 10472.439
with gas pressure though when clearly

10471.12 --> 10475.52
the

10472.439 --> 10477.800000000001
containment is specifically mentioned

10475.52 --> 10479.640000000001
like inside of the math I mean that's

10477.8 --> 10481.039999999999
not where you have to get mathematical

10479.64 --> 10483.479
of course now that's where you have to

10481.04 --> 10485.359
just talk nonsense about barometric

10483.479 --> 10487.92
pressures that are open and so because

10485.359 --> 10490.12
it's open it doesn't require containment

10487.92 --> 10492.479
because open container is not a

10490.12 --> 10495.160000000002
container of course it

10492.479 --> 10499.64
isn't

10495.16 --> 10502.6
yes yeah that open container only works

10499.64 --> 10505.16
if it's inside of a closed

10502.6 --> 10507.04
container cuz if it's inside of an open

10505.16 --> 10509.52
container then there wouldn't be any

10507.04 --> 10510.92
pressure to compare any pressure to in

10509.52 --> 10512.6
that open container because there

10510.92 --> 10515.08
wouldn't be any pressure in the open

10512.6 --> 10516.279
container because it would all explode

10515.08 --> 10519.439
in all

10516.279 --> 10522.439
directions because there is no

10519.439 --> 10523.84
containment to contain the pressure in

10522.439 --> 10528.76
the open

10523.84 --> 10528.76
container that is that barometric

10540.12 --> 10545.160000000002
barometer where is the container it's

10542.68 --> 10545.16
over

10547.239 --> 10551.279
there for

10584.479 --> 10589.519999999999
now I'm not presupposing a container

10586.96 --> 10591.358999999999
it's a necessary antecedent for gas

10589.52 --> 10594.439
pressure to

10591.359 --> 10595.880000000001
exist you can't calculate gas pressure

10594.439 --> 10598.960000000001
without a container is not a

10595.88 --> 10601.358999999999
presupposition a necessary antecedent is

10598.96 --> 10601.358999999999
not a

10602.16 --> 10608.479
presupposition a presupposition is where

10605.279 --> 10612.279
you claim it's there

10608.479 --> 10614.358999999999
even though it doesn't have to be there

10612.279 --> 10615.800000000001
it's just convenient for the argument

10614.359 --> 10618.720000000001
you're going to be

10615.8 --> 10621.8
making to slip it in there a necessary

10618.72 --> 10625.479
antecedent means you can't have it

10621.8 --> 10627.96
without it it cannot exist without

10625.479 --> 10631.92
it

10627.96 --> 10635.039999999999
yeah you don't presuppose a container it

10631.92 --> 10637.72
has to be there you can't have gas

10635.04 --> 10640.479000000001
pressure without it there's no gas

10637.72 --> 10640.479
pressure without a

10643.359 --> 10651.92
container you don't need a container for

10646.279 --> 10651.92
gas to create a force uh no

10685.04 --> 10687.6
gas cannot create a force unless there's

10686.92 --> 10691.960000000001
a

10687.6 --> 10695.800000000001
container yes finally somebody caught on

10691.96 --> 10700.119999999999
that's right gas cannot create a force

10695.8 --> 10700.119999999999
without a container that is correct

10704.479 --> 10710.56
has to press against something that's

10707.52 --> 10714.0
something being the other gas that

10710.56 --> 10716.439
eventually Cascade press against the

10714.0 --> 10720.08
containment and that's what creates the

10716.439 --> 10721.76
gas pressure containment creates the gas

10720.08 --> 10725.56
pressure without the containment there

10721.76 --> 10725.56
is no gas pressure

10728.56 --> 10732.96
so wind needs

10730.239 --> 10736.88
containment yeah gas pressure requires

10732.96 --> 10740.479
containment yeah and wind requires gas

10736.88 --> 10742.64
pressure to exist so in that sense yeah

10740.479 --> 10745.92
because wind requires gas pressure to

10742.64 --> 10748.0
exist it requires a containment yeah

10745.92 --> 10750.319
anything that comes forth from gas

10748.0 --> 10752.8
pressure requires containment gas

10750.319 --> 10755.119999999999
pressure gradient requires containment

10752.8 --> 10759.119999999999
wind requires

10755.12 --> 10759.12
containment yeah

10760.92 --> 10766.56
all of it requires containment

10798.04 --> 10802.68
yeah storms are separate pressure

10800.04 --> 10805.2
systems within the pressure that's right

10802.68 --> 10808.279
but those storms couldn't be separate

10805.2 --> 10810.84
pressure systems within the pressure if

10808.279 --> 10813.04
there was no containment for there to

10810.84 --> 10815.56
form a grass gas

10813.04 --> 10817.800000000001
pressure in order for there to be a

10815.56 --> 10819.72
separate pressure system forming within

10817.8 --> 10822.679999999998
the gas pressure just like the gas

10819.72 --> 10824.479
pressure gradient can form within a gas

10822.68 --> 10827.399
pressure If there is no gas pressure

10824.479 --> 10829.76
because there's no containment yeah

10827.399 --> 10829.76
that's

10831.96 --> 10837.239
right all right anyhow I'm going to

10834.72 --> 10839.438999999998
round out the show I think I made my

10837.239 --> 10841.399
points plenty clear here and the kumu

10839.439 --> 10843.359
virus is never going to progress his

10841.399 --> 10845.599999999999
understanding CU just going to continue

10843.359 --> 10849.92
on this

10845.6 --> 10849.92
endless rambling on

10850.52 --> 10855.439
right so thanks everyone for coming I

10853.68 --> 10857.960000000001
hope you like this show it was very

10855.439 --> 10860.52

10887.439 --> 10892.84
1967 on a Monday really hope I'm going

10890.64 --> 10895.8
to be a little bit more on time I will

Sunday hope your weather is also good

10907.479 --> 10913.33
let's it's pretty decent over

10910.04 --> 10916.36
here might even go out for a bit after

10913.33 --> 10916.36
[Music]

10917.64 --> 10923.72
this all

10920.64 --> 10927.92
right so yeah everybody have a great

10923.72 --> 10930.71
weekend and until the next video keep it

10927.92 --> 10952.64
flat

10930.71 --> 10954.32
