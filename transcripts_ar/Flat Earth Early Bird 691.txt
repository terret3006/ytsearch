talking sun comes out for a little

80.0 --> 83.759
yeah not fully it seems because there's

82.64 --> 88.32
plenty of

83.759 --> 88.32
thick cloud banks out there take a look

94.96 --> 104.0
yeah it's it's cold outside

99.68 --> 104.0
one yeah called chilly

106.399 --> 110.159
but it is kind of dry though it hasn't

108.399 --> 115.04
really rained

110.159 --> 118.0
so far oh look where's the mask

115.04 --> 120.96000000000001
but yeah the clouds have been looking

118.0 --> 124.079
kind of beautiful here and there but

120.96 --> 129.84
right now it's yeah

124.079 --> 129.84
not very interesting anyway

130.319 --> 138.23899999999998
yeah i got

134.4 --> 140.56
green tea with me let's see who's in

138.239 --> 140.56
chat

140.84 --> 145.92000000000002
ah everybody's rolling in i see

144.319 --> 147.83999999999997
right yeah sorry for being a little bit

145.92 --> 151.2
late uh

147.84 --> 154.239
was due to me pretty much waking up

151.2 --> 157.44
20 minutes before two

154.239 --> 160.72
this is 10

157.44 --> 164.16
past half two so yeah

160.72 --> 168.16
because i had a late night

164.16 --> 170.959
and i needed to sleep i guess

168.16 --> 172.4
i think i needed it a lot and i had a

170.959 --> 175.76
bit of a weird meal

172.4 --> 179.28
for my doing yesterday as well

175.76 --> 183.519
uh i yeah i thought like hey

179.28 --> 188.0
let's try this pre-fackit pre

183.519 --> 190.4
packaged uh spaghetti sauce

188.0 --> 191.12
that was vegetarian and it did have soy

190.4 --> 194.31900000000002
in it

191.12 --> 197.44
like what is it seven percent it said

194.319 --> 200.319
so i was like okay i got

197.44 --> 202.319
let's try this i usually don't do that

200.319 --> 206.07999999999998
but i tried it anyway

202.319 --> 209.51899999999998
and i yeah i'm just seeing what it

206.08 --> 212.56
what it's gonna do if if i can feel

209.519 --> 213.84
that i've actually eaten soy because i

212.56 --> 216.879
had a little

213.84 --> 219.12
i i've been collecting a little soy

216.879 --> 223.599
phobia because of the whole

219.12 --> 226.4
story yeah the background concerning soy

223.599 --> 228.0
and that it's also but it's it's really

226.4 --> 229.20000000000002
kind of different parts of the product

228.0 --> 232.879
it's more the seed

229.2 --> 236.64
that is used to uh

232.879 --> 239.28
used as artificial estrogen so

236.64 --> 240.319
yeah and because sometimes in some

239.28 --> 243.2
products i guess

240.319 --> 245.439
they they kind of mix it all up and then

243.2 --> 247.35999999999999
becomes dangerous

245.439 --> 249.519
i've heard suspicions about certain

247.36 --> 252.799
types of soy milk that has that

249.519 --> 256.639
but in in organic land over here

252.799 --> 259.919
i don't think they really do that

256.639 --> 260.919
but still yeah soy has a different type

259.919 --> 264.71999999999997
of

260.919 --> 268.32
biochemistry it can function as a great

264.72 --> 270.72
protein replacement but it's different

268.32 --> 271.68
and yeah i guess people respond

270.72 --> 275.12
differently to it

271.68 --> 277.44
and i yeah i tried it also because i

275.12 --> 279.28000000000003
just really wanted some spaghetti

277.44 --> 282.639
without having to work in the kitchen

279.28 --> 284.479
for at least two hours and then having

282.639 --> 288.08
to eat that for four days

284.479 --> 288.08
now i just wanted one day of it

288.56 --> 292.08
but it was yeah in in a way i guess a

291.199 --> 293.6
little bit

292.08 --> 296.56
make me a little nervous because i

293.6 --> 299.04
usually don't do that

296.56 --> 301.44
look at me getting all hyped up over

299.04 --> 304.0
eating some kind of pre-packaged organic

301.44 --> 308.84
no less food

304.0 --> 311.84
but yeah it seems like it it's done some

308.84 --> 311.84
good

312.0 --> 318.4
garlic and cheesy toast okido

315.68 --> 320.88
well i there was no cheese in there and

318.4 --> 320.88
no meat

321.039 --> 327.44
and yeah the taste was pretty good

324.72 --> 328.16
when it was eventually like in there

327.44 --> 330.71999999999997
yeah

328.16 --> 331.52000000000004
my stomach got a little bit a bit more

330.72 --> 335.36
soury

331.52 --> 337.52
i guess because there were

335.36 --> 338.8
some things in there i think that well i

337.52 --> 341.919
usually don't add

338.8 --> 343.84000000000003
but yeah i wouldn't object to it

341.919 --> 345.75899999999996
or maybe it's just that it's been

343.84 --> 346.4
pre-cooked and it's been sitting in a

345.759 --> 349.28000000000003
pot for

346.4 --> 351.19899999999996
for some time but that happens a lot

349.28 --> 354.479
with me when i start to

351.199 --> 357.52000000000004
yeah cook prefabricated

354.479 --> 358.639
things that's why i make my own stuff

357.52 --> 360.479
mostly because

358.639 --> 364.319
because of that usually it was really

360.479 --> 364.31899999999996
because of the stomach problems at first

365.44 --> 369.12
but yeah it was still good

370.08 --> 374.24
but yeah the yeah it kept me up very

372.88 --> 378.0
long because i ate that

374.24 --> 381.36
like at 10

378.0 --> 385.6
in the evening and yet i stayed up until

381.36 --> 388.8
four or even past four i think i think

385.6 --> 388.8
it was like up to five

389.52 --> 396.79999999999995
it was just very slow going to bed

393.199 --> 399.039
but anyway i'm here enough about all

396.8 --> 399.039
that

403.12 --> 413.28000000000003
all right

408.8 --> 415.759
yeah there were a lot of streams again

413.28 --> 416.79999999999995
the busy day of course also newspaper

415.759 --> 420.319
rounds

416.8 --> 423.84000000000003
and that that all went great

420.319 --> 423.84000000000003
and perfectly

429.919 --> 432.96
right and yeah

434.08 --> 438.24
seeing all kinds of interesting girls

436.24 --> 440.40000000000003
around as well

438.24 --> 441.52
like even in organics or maybe it's like

440.4 --> 445.039
because of the time

441.52 --> 445.039
that they're all out looking now

445.52 --> 450.56
but yeah hey only people can't see a

448.56 --> 452.639

oh you watched that stream again

627.12 --> 634.24
yeah i wasn't yet definitely right uh

630.88 --> 637.4399999999999
yeah own benjamin was also alive

634.24 --> 640.32
with curtis stone on the urban farmer

637.44 --> 643.2790000000001
and yeah they were just talking about

640.32 --> 643.279
farming endless

644.839 --> 647.839
endless

653.839 --> 658.5600000000001
and also yeah he showed some more

656.94 --> 662.1
[Music]

658.56 --> 665.279
some more ira inspired videos

662.1 --> 668.399
[Music]

665.279 --> 670.959
so yeah that was pretty funny

668.399 --> 673.279
and a good time in there as well and

670.959 --> 676.7199999999999
yeah somewhere after there

673.279 --> 678.88
rodrigo ferrari nunez is also

676.72 --> 681.12
doing more streams he does he does a lot

678.88 --> 683.4399999999999
of a lot of those

681.12 --> 685.6
and uh yeah i didn't watch all of that

683.44 --> 685.6
but

686.16 --> 689.6
but at least i remember having seen some

688.72 --> 691.9200000000001
of that

689.6 --> 693.839
and after that it was just watching

691.92 --> 695.76
netflix again

693.839 --> 697.36
more of that series and just being a

695.76 --> 701.2
little bit baffled about

697.36 --> 705.839
the turn that it's going

701.2 --> 707.6800000000001
the worst witch it is a really odd thing

705.839 --> 709.839
like i have to really watch through the

707.68 --> 713.3599999999999
entire thing

709.839 --> 715.6800000000001
i have to it's i'm so so terrible no no

713.36 --> 719.2
no it is kind of fun for me it's it's an

715.68 --> 719.1999999999999
interesting series for me

719.68 --> 724.16
for just yeah comparing it

722.639 --> 727.839
metaphorically it's it's

724.16 --> 731.92
quite fascinating cross-referencing it

727.839 --> 733.7600000000001
certain things in my mind

731.92 --> 736.16
but yeah i'm gonna have to watch through

733.76 --> 737.04
the entire thing to really make up my

736.16 --> 739.36
mind to

737.04 --> 740.639
to be able to like judge what the total

739.36 --> 744.5600000000001
influence is

740.639 --> 747.839
because there yeah there are some really

744.56 --> 748.3199999999999
odd things happening as well but again

747.839 --> 751.36
it's

748.32 --> 752.1600000000001
non-sexual all of it but there are some

751.36 --> 756.839
odd

752.16 --> 758.0
things and like how for example they

756.839 --> 761.12
deal

758.0 --> 761.6
yeah i guess it's also the age typically

761.12 --> 766.32
like

761.6 --> 768.0
between eight and twelve

766.32 --> 769.839
and then they're dealing with lying and

768.0 --> 773.44
keeping secrets

769.839 --> 776.8800000000001
and yeah it's it gets a bit

773.44 --> 777.519
a little convoluted i think eventually

776.88 --> 779.6
like after

777.519 --> 781.04
i'm now what is it in the third season

779.6 --> 782.88
already i think

781.04 --> 785.12
we're still in the end of the second

782.88 --> 786.88
somewhere and it gets a bit weird here

785.12 --> 790.8
and there but it's still interesting

786.88 --> 792.639
by the way uh thank you again for the

966.8 --> 970.399
that not

967.36 --> 974.9590000000001
mass attracting mass no

970.399 --> 977.839
no no it's not an experiment

974.959 --> 978.959
not a proper it's just a a device and

977.839 --> 981.6800000000001
then

978.959 --> 982.7199999999999
a phenomenon sort of is conjured within

981.68 --> 986.56
the apparatus but

982.72 --> 990.1600000000001
when you look at the experiment the math

986.56 --> 992.88
it doesn't actually do anything

990.16 --> 995.199
it's just a demonstration of a

992.88 --> 1000.24
conceptual thing

995.199 --> 1002.24
a trick a mass is not attracting mass

1000.24 --> 1005.04
and that's not even what the cavendish

1002.24 --> 1010.32
experiment is about

1005.04 --> 1012.8
so no

1010.32 --> 1015.0400000000001
and yeah it's not official either you

1012.8 --> 1015.04
know

1016.72 --> 1020.5600000000001
look you can imagine that mass attracts

1019.92 --> 1023.519
mass

1020.56 --> 1024.079
and there are certain types of natural

1023.519 --> 1026.4
forces

1024.079 --> 1027.1599999999999
that happen like surface tension and all

1026.4 --> 1032.16
that

1027.16 --> 1036.4
electrostatics those are all local

1032.16 --> 1036.4
reach based type of effects

1036.839 --> 1044.0
forces and yeah gravity

1040.0 --> 1046.64
is not that so gravity officially isn't

1044.0 --> 1048.4
even mass attracted by mass

1046.64 --> 1050.72
it's not even relevant anymore and

1048.4 --> 1052.799
besides if you look at the technicals of

1050.72 --> 1056.4
the supposed cavendish experiment it

1052.799 --> 1059.679
is not there to even set out to prove

1056.4 --> 1059.679
mass attracts mass

1062.16 --> 1069.76
it's there to weigh

1065.6 --> 1081.36
the earth which is ludicrous

1069.76 --> 1095.84
it's just a calculation trick

1081.36 --> 1095.84
yeah indeed good servant

1097.36 --> 1105.12
well good for you so

1100.64 --> 1108.64
you saw something moving did you see it

1105.12 --> 1110.8799999999999
or it had moved after everybody came

1108.64 --> 1110.88
back

1111.919 --> 1123.8400000000001
was there a camera 24 7 on it

1128.72 --> 1132.96
yeah well roger look if they're gonna do

1130.72 --> 1135.28
it with a lead brick

1132.96 --> 1137.8400000000001
then electrostatics is not gonna really

1135.28 --> 1137.84
influence it

1137.919 --> 1142.7990000000002
but the thing is there's just all kinds

1140.48 --> 1146.0
of weird issues because

1142.799 --> 1149.44
of the the idea of the torsion

1146.0 --> 1154.08
balance that makes it so easy

1149.44 --> 1155.8400000000001
to be subjected to movement right

1154.08 --> 1158.799
yeah there's all kinds of issues there's

1155.84 --> 1160.72
just the wind

1158.799 --> 1162.08
pressure changes in the air which

1160.72 --> 1165.44
happens naturally there's

1162.08 --> 1169.28
so many things

1165.44 --> 1172.96
you can't really control it and then

1169.28 --> 1178.24
statistically it kind of averages out

1172.96 --> 1181.76
it's statistically it not moving is not

1178.24 --> 1184.64
an exception it's kind of 50

1181.76 --> 1187.52
50. that's what it becomes on average

1184.64 --> 1192.0
which means

1187.52 --> 1196.32
you know

1192.0 --> 1196.32
that it's rather like like a coin flip

1199.04 --> 1202.109
[Music]

1204.84 --> 1207.84
so

1208.64 --> 1217.2
right well fv stop motion did anybody

1212.64 --> 1220.5590000000002
a three did anybody in class

1217.2 --> 1223.3600000000001
i take it this was at school

1220.559 --> 1223.6789999999999
did was anybody allowed to even check

1223.36 --> 1228.0
out

1223.679 --> 1231.3600000000001
and touch the device before it was set

1228.0 --> 1233.6
up for the experiment

1231.36 --> 1236.0
anybody actually allowed to check and

1233.6 --> 1238.6399999999999
feel like how the torsion ballast

1236.0 --> 1238.64
what that is

1239.679 --> 1244.4
or was it just brought in like that

1242.08 --> 1245.9189999999999
setup and then it's like nobody touches

1244.4 --> 1249.8400000000001
this

1245.919 --> 1249.8400000000001
how did they do it

1255.22 --> 1258.279
[Music]

1281.12 --> 1286.8799999999999
right enemy can well that doesn't really

1283.2 --> 1286.88
sound like a proper phenomenon

1288.32 --> 1294.799
could a torsion bar twist

1291.76 --> 1297.44
i haven't you know that only works if

1294.799 --> 1297.44
you make one

1297.919 --> 1302.7990000000002
and then you specifically align it in a

1300.4 --> 1304.799
way that it is in perfect balance that

1302.799 --> 1308.48
i've never seen that happen just

1304.799 --> 1310.559
naturally without the influence of man

1308.48 --> 1313.28
so i don't think that's a proper natural

1310.559 --> 1313.28
phenomenon

1314.08 --> 1319.84
thank you for bringing that up adam

1324.64 --> 1329.1200000000001
right but i still asked a question to uh

1327.039 --> 1331.919
f three stop motion about

1329.12 --> 1333.36
if anybody was even allowed to touch the

1331.919 --> 1338.5590000000002
apparatus before

1333.36 --> 1338.559
it was set up to do the thing

1338.72 --> 1342.72
is anybody allowed to feel yeah wiggle

1341.919 --> 1346.48
around

1342.72 --> 1351.44
with the torsion bar to feel what it is

1346.48 --> 1351.44
oh check my skype yeah i noticed

1354.32 --> 1365.6789999999999
oh wow thanks man

1361.679 --> 1368.48
yeah thanks onlyshipocatsia i really

1365.679 --> 1368.48
appreciate that

1368.799 --> 1373.6
thank you is it okay if i mention i'm

1372.08 --> 1376.24
not gonna mention amounts i don't do

1373.6 --> 1378.559
that anymore

1376.24 --> 1380.0
well yeah now people already can figure

1378.559 --> 1381.9189999999999
out what it is

1380.0 --> 1389.84
but thank you very much for the support

1381.919 --> 1389.8400000000001
i really appreciate that

1400.84 --> 1403.84
hmm

1406.32 --> 1410.0
yeah and i'm glad you're doing well i

1409.2 --> 1414.0
hope you got

1410.0 --> 1415.6
out of uh the earlier predicament

1414.0 --> 1417.2
because you had some trouble because of

1415.6 --> 1420.7199999999998
the corona

1417.2 --> 1420.72
trade i guess

1421.279 --> 1425.6
you had access problems or something i

1423.52 --> 1428.24
don't know i don't want to

1425.6 --> 1429.84
share things about your situation you

1428.24 --> 1431.36
that you don't want to but i hope you

1429.84 --> 1434.32
got out of it that it stopped

1431.36 --> 1436.7199999999998
something that you're back back into

1434.32 --> 1436.72
business

1440.4 --> 1444.799
hey thank you good servant for the 99

1442.559 --> 1450.0
super chat donation and

1444.799 --> 1450.0
the shocked smiley face for some reason

1454.559 --> 1458.799
a teacher had it set up when we arrived

1457.279 --> 1460.24
the only thing we touched were the

1458.799 --> 1463.039
bricks

1460.24 --> 1463.039
well there you go

1466.4 --> 1473.279
yeah you know in my class

1469.6 --> 1474.48
we didn't get the cavendish torsion bar

1473.279 --> 1476.96
twist set up

1474.48 --> 1478.159
as a demonstration we were told about it

1476.96 --> 1481.3600000000001
but we got another

1478.159 --> 1484.3200000000002
special little experiment

1481.36 --> 1485.279
that i was critical of and it got a very

1484.32 --> 1487.2
angry look

1485.279 --> 1490.559
from the guy that was in charge of that

1487.2 --> 1494.24
when it happened i remember this from

1490.559 --> 1497.36
was it 96 or something 1995

1494.24 --> 1501.1200000000001
and what they did it showed

1497.36 --> 1504.08
like this weird thing

1501.12 --> 1506.32
with another thing in proximity and like

1504.08 --> 1510.1589999999999
it had a weight

1506.32 --> 1512.08
and then they put some kind of thing

1510.159 --> 1514.72
next to it and then the weight would

1512.08 --> 1517.84
decrease and that would be the way

1514.72 --> 1519.76
to prove that mass attracted mass

1517.84 --> 1521.76
because the attraction of the

1519.76 --> 1523.279
other thing that was suspended above it

1521.76 --> 1526.8799999999999
would pull it away

1523.279 --> 1529.2
a little is not magnetics at all right

1526.88 --> 1529.919
so i addressed that and it's like hey

1529.2 --> 1533.3600000000001
can i

1529.919 --> 1537.1200000000001
can i pick that up can i feel its weight

1533.36 --> 1539.039
that day we're like no okay

1537.12 --> 1540.7199999999998
that is the demonstration that i got

1539.039 --> 1542.559
back in the day and that got me into a

1540.72 --> 1546.4
lot of trouble because that

1542.559 --> 1549.84
yeah they picked up that i

1546.4 --> 1549.8400000000001
was not a muggle as well

1550.08 --> 1554.84
and then i got into yeah jesuit guy

1553.039 --> 1558.08
trouble

1554.84 --> 1561.039
so that's how i got into

1558.08 --> 1561.039
that situation

1562.32 --> 1565.9189999999999
but i never got to see the torsion bar

1564.4 --> 1569.039
twist concept

1565.919 --> 1570.3200000000002
oh by the way thank you puxley lovejoy

1569.039 --> 1570.96
for the five dollar super chat the

1570.32 --> 1574.48
nation

1570.96 --> 1578.559
the sun is too far away to keep hold on

1574.48 --> 1579.279
the earth earth flying in a straight

1578.559 --> 1583.6789999999999
line

1579.279 --> 1585.279
at 66 600 miles per hour would leave the

1583.679 --> 1589.3600000000001
sun

1585.279 --> 1589.36
or i don't know

1590.72 --> 1596.799
what but thank you for the

1593.84 --> 1596.799
supergeneration

1597.679 --> 1602.64
look in their presupposed mechanics they

1600.64 --> 1604.88
they got it sort of packed like

1602.64 --> 1605.76
the presuppositional mechanics in

1604.88 --> 1608.159
themselves

1605.76 --> 1610.8799999999999
perhaps make no sense in phys within

1608.159 --> 1613.5200000000002
physical reality

1610.88 --> 1615.44
but they have been worked out to

1613.52 --> 1617.36
function so i don't know if that

1615.44 --> 1621.1200000000001
statement is necessarily true

1617.36 --> 1621.12
but thank you for the super chat anyway

1624.32 --> 1641.84
work is stable yeah good to hear only

1626.64 --> 1641.8400000000001
people can see

1663.279 --> 1669.76
well pakistani love joy

1666.399 --> 1674.08
technically that's incorrect

1669.76 --> 1677.76
because you are now grabbing onto

1674.08 --> 1680.559
the general idea that's eventually left

1677.76 --> 1681.76
in people's minds about what gravity is

1680.559 --> 1685.6
supposed to be

1681.76 --> 1688.559
in actuality that no

1685.6 --> 1689.76
because the gravity is not a force

1688.559 --> 1692.08
anymore

1689.76 --> 1693.76
and it doesn't necessarily decrease over

1692.08 --> 1696.6399999999999
distance it's

1693.76 --> 1698.08
more mysterious like that because there

1696.64 --> 1702.0
is simply no

1698.08 --> 1704.72
explanation what causes

1702.0 --> 1707.12
things to specifically be drawn to a

1704.72 --> 1707.1200000000001
point

1707.84 --> 1711.1999999999998
except just the bending of space-time as

1710.24 --> 1714.88
if it was

1711.2 --> 1718.64
decided from a fourth dimension

1714.88 --> 1721.679
like there just happens to be this this

1718.64 --> 1724.0800000000002
cam yeah this cavity this

1721.679 --> 1725.2
well where things happen to come

1724.08 --> 1727.6789999999999
together so no

1725.2 --> 1729.52
it's not really over distance that's not

1727.679 --> 1731.8400000000001
how it works there is no

1729.52 --> 1733.679
linear relation between masses and the

1731.84 --> 1735.4399999999998
distance anymore it's

1733.679 --> 1736.96
it's something more mysterious it's the

1735.44 --> 1740.559
bending of space-time

1736.96 --> 1743.8400000000001
that just draws matter towards

1740.559 --> 1747.84
points in a very specific

1743.84 --> 1750.8799999999999
space-time framework that is very

1747.84 --> 1753.4399999999998
mystical that's what it is really

1750.88 --> 1756.24
it draws it completely away from any

1753.44 --> 1759.6000000000001
tie-in with physical reality but heavily

1756.24 --> 1762.72
structurally supports the virtual

1759.6 --> 1765.84
design that the

1762.72 --> 1767.3600000000001
designers of it the mathematicians the

1765.84 --> 1770.799
jesuits are building on

1767.36 --> 1774.399
it from the outside their approach

1770.799 --> 1776.399
can be heavily their their constructions

1774.399 --> 1778.4799999999998
can be heavily supported through that

1776.399 --> 1780.799
framework because it doesn't have a

1778.48 --> 1784.159
physical connection to reality

1780.799 --> 1784.1589999999999
because it is so virtual

1784.32 --> 1787.6789999999999
yeah i don't know maybe this doesn't

1785.679 --> 1790.799
make sense to a lot of you but

1787.679 --> 1792.88
i know what i mean i might get back to

1790.799 --> 1796.0
that

1792.88 --> 1796.0
somebody doesn't get it

1796.799 --> 1799.12
right

1800.0 --> 1804.32
yeah but in the flawed model there is no

1802.24 --> 1809.84
real

1804.32 --> 1809.84
attraction force of gravity

1814.24 --> 1817.6
it's just that at certain points in

1817.12 --> 1820.2399999999998
space

1817.6 --> 1821.6789999999999
in correlating with these space bending

1820.24 --> 1824.799
model

1821.679 --> 1829.6000000000001
mass masses just happen to be

1824.799 --> 1832.1589999999999
falling towards by being

1829.6 --> 1833.6
pulled in by yeah the space-time

1832.159 --> 1837.279
distortion the space

1833.6 --> 1842.24
bending it just gets caught in the

1837.279 --> 1842.24
fall of the space bending supposedly

1842.88 --> 1849.6000000000001
and it's not really distance bound

1846.559 --> 1853.279
although it is supposedly experienced as

1849.6 --> 1855.6789999999999
such yeah that way it stays very vague

1853.279 --> 1857.76
you can still think of it as forces

1855.679 --> 1858.24
somewhere but you can't really pin it

1857.76 --> 1860.48
down

1858.24 --> 1862.159
anymore see you can still think of it

1860.48 --> 1864.32
but you can't really pin it down and say

1862.159 --> 1867.44
this is what actually the physic

1864.32 --> 1869.4399999999998
physics behind it no no no no that's

1867.44 --> 1871.519
you can think of it like that it's very

1869.44 --> 1874.0
helpful

1871.519 --> 1874.799
as a distraction to get away from the

1874.0 --> 1878.24
completely

1874.799 --> 1879.9189999999999
virtual new official model

1878.24 --> 1882.08
space-time bending if that's too

1879.919 --> 1884.3200000000002
confusing for you which it is which it

1882.08 --> 1886.0
was designed to to draw away from the

1884.32 --> 1889.6789999999999
physical reality

1886.0 --> 1891.6
so you can think that mass attracts mass

1889.679 --> 1892.72
and that it has a distance and influence

1891.6 --> 1896.0
and all that

1892.72 --> 1899.679
but officially it isn't see

1896.0 --> 1906.96
and the ballers trenchers and all that

1899.679 --> 1910.799
they have been engaging at just that

1906.96 --> 1914.96
and we should not follow their example

1910.799 --> 1916.08
in our even our conceptual exploration

1914.96 --> 1918.159
we should learn

1916.08 --> 1919.12
from their fundamental mistakes and

1918.159 --> 1921.919
bypass that

1919.12 --> 1923.4399999999998
in our exploration of what their model

1921.919 --> 1925.039
is and should be

1923.44 --> 1927.919
that's what i've been doing that's what

1925.039 --> 1927.919
nathan is doing

1932.24 --> 1936.3990000000001
and the rest of the flat earth debates

1946.84 --> 1949.84
crew

1960.84 --> 1963.84
what

1966.88 --> 1971.919
all right yeah plunder 23 i know isn't

1970.159 --> 1975.1200000000001
it ridiculous

1971.919 --> 1979.3600000000001
just imagine the satellites being

1975.12 --> 1983.5189999999998
thousands of miles away

1979.36 --> 1987.4399999999998
a lot and then they're gonna be relaying

1983.519 --> 1989.36
those super thick packed signals

1987.44 --> 1990.799
like how where is that energy coming

1989.36 --> 1993.12
from for it to do that

1990.799 --> 1995.2
for for that satellite hovering there to

1993.12 --> 1999.76
relay all that

1995.2 --> 1999.76
it's ridiculous so much energy

2001.2 --> 2008.559
like they needed a nuclear reactor

2005.039 --> 2010.08
and not just a miniature one

2008.559 --> 2012.32
nuclear you know what i mean they need

2010.08 --> 2014.8799999999999
some serious power generation in order

2012.32 --> 2018.0
to pump out that level of signal

2014.88 --> 2022.5590000000002
and then yeah that signal is literally

2018.0 --> 2022.559
going to spread everywhere

2022.64 --> 2028.48
and it's going to maybe even roast

2025.919 --> 2029.6000000000001
things at a high altitude in close

2028.48 --> 2031.279
proximity to it

2029.6 --> 2033.039
i don't know and then imagine they're

2031.279 --> 2035.84
supposed to be tens of thousands of

2033.039 --> 2038.1589999999999
those up there hanging doing that

2035.84 --> 2038.8799999999999
it's absurd everything up there would be

2038.159 --> 2042.3990000000001
roasted

2038.88 --> 2044.3200000000002
would be emp'ed almost to that level

2042.399 --> 2046.0
which is the electrics would become

2044.32 --> 2048.72
distorted every time something

2046.0 --> 2048.72
would go up

2050.32 --> 2061.839
i think check your skype again when you

2053.28 --> 2061.8390000000004
can oh

2063.44 --> 2065.679
oh

2066.639 --> 2070.159
oh you want me to get oh sorry i

2069.2 --> 2072.0789999999997
overlooked that

2070.159 --> 2074.2400000000002
i got this i didn't see that you wanted

2072.079 --> 2077.599
to get on my show a bit

2074.24 --> 2078.9599999999996
yeah i could do that sorry i sorry i

2077.599 --> 2083.2000000000003
didn't notice that i was just

2078.96 --> 2085.52
on to the the rest

2083.2 --> 2087.1189999999997
but yeah if you want to come on i could

2085.52 --> 2087.52
i could do that it's been a while since

2087.119 --> 2092.3990000000003
i had

2087.52 --> 2092.399
anybody on all right

2092.72 --> 2106.3199999999997
let me set up

and

2219.68 --> 2224.0
thanks for the support how are you doing

2221.52 --> 2226.48
it's been a long time

2224.0 --> 2227.76
yeah no it has been a while um this

2226.48 --> 2229.359
year's

2227.76 --> 2232.1600000000003
this year has been pretty rough to be

2229.359 --> 2232.16
honest owen

2233.2 --> 2238.8799999999997
yeah considering my plastic comes from

2236.4 --> 2238.88
wuhan

2239.28 --> 2242.5600000000004
you can imagine the logistics problem

2242.079 --> 2245.76
there

2242.56 --> 2247.04
but um to put it put it in the

2245.76 --> 2249.6800000000003
perspective

2247.04 --> 2253.04
we ordered plastic in december 18th and

2249.68 --> 2253.04
it arrived in july

2254.16 --> 2260.24
december july wow about half a year so

2258.24 --> 2261.68
yeah so everything was backlogged and

2260.24 --> 2264.0789999999997
all the rest of it

2261.68 --> 2264.0789999999997
um

2264.88 --> 2271.839
wow all right well at least you got it

2269.52 --> 2272.64
yeah that's good it was pretty much okay

2271.839 --> 2274.4
they had

2272.64 --> 2275.92
similar troubles with an order that i

2274.4 --> 2277.92
did

2275.92 --> 2279.2000000000003
like right took me a half a year before

2277.92 --> 2282.079
it got here

2279.2 --> 2285.839
as well so and that wasn't even from

2282.079 --> 2285.8390000000004
from china or anything

2286.96 --> 2290.32
the reason i wanted to talk to you um is

2289.44 --> 2293.2000000000003
um

2290.32 --> 2293.52
remember last year we spoke about you

2293.2 --> 2297.839
know

2293.52 --> 2298.72
um giveaways for your for your viewers

2297.839 --> 2303.119
oh right

2298.72 --> 2306.7999999999997
oh yeah yeah i remember that those ideas

2303.119 --> 2310.32
um well since then i've kind of

2306.8 --> 2312.0
um purchased more equipment and so now

2310.32 --> 2314.48
not only do i have industrial 3d

2312.0 --> 2317.92
printers i've got um

2314.48 --> 2318.48
i've got a laser cutter and so i was

2317.92 --> 2320.0
thinking

2318.48 --> 2322.72
you know we could make some pretty cool

2320.0 --> 2323.599
laser-cut laser etched giveaway prizes

2322.72 --> 2326.3199999999997
for

2323.599 --> 2327.119
for your viewers like we talked about

2326.32 --> 2329.839
you know

2327.119 --> 2329.839
um okay

2330.32 --> 2333.76
basically you know i was thinking in the

2333.359 --> 2335.359
light

2333.76 --> 2337.0400000000004
something you know personalized either

2335.359 --> 2340.4
with their names on it

2337.04 --> 2342.32
um maybe you give me your signature we

2340.4 --> 2345.599
can etch your signature into it you know

2342.32 --> 2348.0
these type of cool ideas uh you know

2345.599 --> 2349.2000000000003
unique ideas for for your for your loyal

2348.0 --> 2351.599
listeners and

2349.2 --> 2352.72
you know maybe create competitions each

2351.599 --> 2355.44
month or something i

2352.72 --> 2357.2
don't know you'd work it out but just 3d

2355.44 --> 2360.32
printing has a certain

2357.2 --> 2363.4399999999996
uh certain how do you say

2360.32 --> 2364.8
finish whereas laser cut is we're

2363.44 --> 2368.64
talking

2364.8 --> 2371.44
you know 0.0001 millimeter

2368.64 --> 2372.96
right you know resolution so you can do

2371.44 --> 2374.64
photos you can do

2372.96 --> 2376.64
you know we can do you know engraved

2374.64 --> 2378.8799999999997
etching into yeah

2376.64 --> 2380.56
plastic you know so just keep that in

2378.88 --> 2383.839
mind i think it would be cool

2380.56 --> 2387.119
uh certainly that is very cool

2383.839 --> 2389.599
yeah i'm just kind of cool you know

2387.119 --> 2390.8
remember we talked about um you wanted

2389.599 --> 2393.04
to use the

2390.8 --> 2395.119
the me for you know me for tags and all

2393.04 --> 2396.079
that stuff's totally totally possible so

2395.119 --> 2400.8
just keep that in mind

2396.079 --> 2402.8
you know yeah let me know you know

2400.8 --> 2403.92
right well i still haven't really

2402.8 --> 2406.96
thought of anything

2403.92 --> 2409.359
suitable that wouldn't feel to me like i

2406.96 --> 2409.359
was just

2409.44 --> 2414.16
random stuff you know because i don't

2412.64 --> 2417.2799999999997
want to add to

2414.16 --> 2419.2799999999997
yeah just giving uh

2417.28 --> 2421.92
how do you call that i i just don't like

2419.28 --> 2423.8390000000004
making uh yeah causing a lot of junk

2421.92 --> 2425.04
eventually so it would have to be

2423.839 --> 2426.48
something really good

2425.04 --> 2428.16
you know that's not just going to be

2426.48 --> 2428.56
thrown away at some point because i

2428.16 --> 2431.2
would

2428.56 --> 2432.319
add to the junk pile you know absolutely

2431.2 --> 2435.4399999999996
just for a gimmick

2432.319 --> 2437.2
i'm very against that sort of thing so

2435.44 --> 2438.8
what i have been thinking about in the

2437.2 --> 2441.68
back of my mind

2438.8 --> 2443.8390000000004
and so far i don't know i can't really

2441.68 --> 2446.56
think of something

2443.839 --> 2447.7599999999998
that well that wouldn't like the

2446.56 --> 2450.24
keychain thing

2447.76 --> 2451.5200000000004
yeah that is typically eventually it

2450.24 --> 2454.0789999999997
would still

2451.52 --> 2454.64
yeah break or just be thrown away you

2454.079 --> 2457.8390000000004
know

2454.64 --> 2459.92
that sort of thing i so i yeah

2457.839 --> 2462.4
it's more it's more about participation

2459.92 --> 2464.319
and you know memorabilia than actual

2462.4 --> 2465.6800000000003
always about practical use that's what i

2464.319 --> 2466.48
with this kind of sort of thinking you

2465.68 --> 2468.0
know

2466.48 --> 2469.68
especially if you you know make it a

2468.0 --> 2472.079
long term thing you know you have the

2469.68 --> 2473.5989999999997
variations in the series and that's why

2472.079 --> 2476.2400000000002
you know it would take some it would

2473.599 --> 2478.319
take some you know decision on your part

2476.24 --> 2480.9599999999996
but i think that you know

2478.319 --> 2482.96
ultimately you you'll be a part of your

2480.96 --> 2484.88
history on youtube that that was my

2482.96 --> 2486.88
intention behind it you know regardless

2484.88 --> 2490.4
of what you believe in

2486.88 --> 2492.48
um you know it's more about

2490.4 --> 2494.319
interaction with your law you know your

2492.48 --> 2496.64
longtime loyal people here in

2494.319 --> 2497.44
in the chat that i always see you know

2496.64 --> 2500.7999999999997
so

2497.44 --> 2502.48
all right i've i've got a day off that

2500.8 --> 2504.6400000000003
basically tomorrow i was meant to be

2502.48 --> 2505.92
doing work but guys rescheduled that's

2504.64 --> 2509.2
why i'm even up right now

2505.92 --> 2511.28
to talk to you because you know with the

2509.2 --> 2512.7999999999997
with everything it's it's kind of hard

2511.28 --> 2514.7200000000003
to

2512.8 --> 2516.2400000000002
stay up like i used to and be productive

2514.72 --> 2520.24
the next morning you know

2516.24 --> 2523.2799999999997
so right now of course

2520.24 --> 2525.9199999999996
yeah business comes first

2523.28 --> 2527.6800000000003
yeah i just i kind of sit said an eight

2525.92 --> 2528.56
o'clock start for myself you know and

2527.68 --> 2530.3999999999996
that's kind of

2528.56 --> 2531.839
restricts me especially when people hold

2530.4 --> 2535.359
me to that oh can i come

2531.839 --> 2537.119
over and see if it's like oh no so

2535.359 --> 2538.96
but no i just something to think about

2537.119 --> 2539.28
nothing nothing to hold you to but you

2538.96 --> 2541.76
know

2539.28 --> 2543.0400000000004
um because the idea would be we make a

2541.76 --> 2546.3190000000004
whole bunch of designs

2543.04 --> 2548.8
um i send you a package of those designs

2546.319 --> 2550.56
you know and then you you create the

2548.8 --> 2553.92
competitions and giveaways

2550.56 --> 2557.2
and you know as you as you please right

2553.92 --> 2558.88
well look on the short run the only

2557.2 --> 2561.1189999999997
thing that i could really think of

2558.88 --> 2562.56
in general that i would find worthy to

2561.119 --> 2564.56
have

2562.56 --> 2566.16
done with that sort of thing is like

2564.56 --> 2570.24
figurines

2566.16 --> 2571.1189999999997
because figurines is in my personal int

2570.24 --> 2573.9199999999996
and this is kind of

2571.119 --> 2575.04
egotistical maybe but because of i'm a

2573.92 --> 2578.56
dungeon master

2575.04 --> 2582.0
d game tabletop and yeah

2578.56 --> 2584.96
figurines can be really awesome

2582.0 --> 2586.079
you know it's basically little models of

2584.96 --> 2587.92
people

2586.079 --> 2590.0
and you can make them however you want

2587.92 --> 2592.7200000000003
to be in a way you want

2590.0 --> 2594.319
and yeah you already know pretty much

2592.72 --> 2595.52
that the amount of variety that you

2594.319 --> 2596.4
could do with that is endless and

2595.52 --> 2600.24
there's like

2596.4 --> 2603.359
millions of miniature 3d printable

2600.24 --> 2604.9599999999996
model frameworks out there even so

2603.359 --> 2606.7999999999997
yeah but i mean that was always

2604.96 --> 2609.359
available the first time

2606.8 --> 2610.319
i mean my first my first uh my first

2609.359 --> 2613.119
printer was a

2610.319 --> 2613.7599999999998
uh was the resin printer you know which

2613.119 --> 2615.6800000000003
is made

2613.76 --> 2617.92
made for making miniature figures and

2615.68 --> 2621.04
we've had that ability for over a year

2617.92 --> 2623.359
you know um this is just adding laser

2621.04 --> 2625.7599999999998
cutting to my arsenal yeah the details

2623.359 --> 2627.44
yeah this way you can have one of those

2625.76 --> 2628.8
figurines and they could be holding a

2627.44 --> 2633.359
book and you could actually

2628.8 --> 2635.44
etch some readable if you have to have a

2633.359 --> 2638.48
loop on that you can add some readable

2635.44 --> 2641.92
text on the pages of that mini book

2638.48 --> 2643.44
right oh yeah i mean exactly that's

2641.92 --> 2646.8
pretty awesome

2643.44 --> 2646.8
yeah i mean there's

2647.119 --> 2654.319
it's about co it's about combining the

2650.56 --> 2656.0
you know available you know um

2654.319 --> 2658.24
different you know technologies and

2656.0 --> 2659.839
methods together now and

2658.24 --> 2662.0
you know the other day i worked with an

2659.839 --> 2664.56
electrician and i 3d printed a cover

2662.0 --> 2666.0
and then i laser cut a plastic perspex

2664.56 --> 2667.599
cover to go over that cover so it was

2666.0 --> 2669.04
like a water shield

2667.599 --> 2670.6400000000003
you know so that was combining the two

2669.04 --> 2673.68
things basic but still

2670.64 --> 2675.68
the concept is there uh you know i just

2673.68 --> 2677.2
you know i normally i charge out you

2675.68 --> 2680.319
know quite

2677.2 --> 2680.8799999999997
a lot um for these services but because

2680.319 --> 2682.16
of

2680.88 --> 2683.839
you know our history and everything

2682.16 --> 2684.8799999999997
you've helped me with i'm i offer them

2683.839 --> 2688.24
to you free

2684.88 --> 2688.2400000000002
that is super awesome man

2688.56 --> 2692.88
you know and i think i know you know

2690.8 --> 2693.119
maybe maybe people in the chat can you

2692.88 --> 2694.88
know

2693.119 --> 2696.88
um give feedback on what they think

2694.88 --> 2699.119
would be awesome you know from

2696.88 --> 2701.28
keyrings to coasters to like you said

2699.119 --> 2702.8
dnd figures if we provide the file we

2701.28 --> 2706.1600000000003
can make it you know

2702.8 --> 2707.599
um you know but just just you know just

2706.16 --> 2709.359
keep that keep that on the back

2707.599 --> 2711.2000000000003
burner and keep it on your mind and you

2709.359 --> 2712.72
know and hit me up and

2711.2 --> 2715.5989999999997
and we can go we can go from there

2712.72 --> 2718.72
because it's got a 1.3

2715.599 --> 2720.319
by 90 centimeter 1.3 meter by 90

2718.72 --> 2722.24
centimeter cutting deck so we could make

2720.319 --> 2723.04
a whole bunch of different things in one

2722.24 --> 2725.2
go

2723.04 --> 2726.88
you know you think about how how many

2725.2 --> 2728.16
things you can get out of that one piece

2726.88 --> 2731.52
of plastic or

2728.16 --> 2732.56
wood or or what have you so keep it in

2731.52 --> 2735.839
mind right

2732.56 --> 2738.0789999999997
yeah yeah the problem with me

2735.839 --> 2740.24
was always with the 3d printers is that

2738.079 --> 2741.8390000000004
it has too many options it drives me

2740.24 --> 2744.8799999999997
nuts that's

2741.839 --> 2747.7599999999998
my problem but yeah

2744.88 --> 2750.8
if you just the thing is if you just got

2747.76 --> 2752.5600000000004
a really specific plan

2750.8 --> 2753.92
and you got that straight in your mind

2752.56 --> 2757.7599999999998
exactly how you want it

2753.92 --> 2760.079
then a 3d printer just is amazing

2757.76 --> 2761.76
but you gotta have a really good idea

2760.079 --> 2762.2400000000002
that you really want to finalize like

2761.76 --> 2763.6800000000003
that

2762.24 --> 2765.2799999999997
otherwise if you're just going to dig

2763.68 --> 2767.5989999999997
out there you're going to go nuts

2765.28 --> 2769.119
from everything that you could do oh

2767.599 --> 2771.6800000000003
yeah yeah

2769.119 --> 2772.7200000000003
i can draw in 3d to a certain degree but

2771.68 --> 2774.8799999999997
my designs

2772.72 --> 2776.56
are more linear you know working with

2774.88 --> 2779.04
companies making prototypes or

2776.56 --> 2780.48
for machine based things and you know

2779.04 --> 2782.0
organic modeling for

2780.48 --> 2785.119
for characters and things you know i

2782.0 --> 2788.079
like ornamental designer parts

2785.119 --> 2789.599
yeah exactly but i mean if you if you

2788.079 --> 2791.599
find something i mean

2789.599 --> 2793.599
the the key thing is here is that it

2791.599 --> 2795.04
comes from you to your viewers and i

2793.599 --> 2796.319
think that's the connection and the

2795.04 --> 2798.24
interaction that

2796.319 --> 2800.0
you know i i thought of offering it's

2798.24 --> 2802.8799999999997
not so much what it is it's just

2800.0 --> 2804.4
where it comes from and what it means so

2802.88 --> 2806.7200000000003
you know

2804.4 --> 2808.0
so well keep it keeping your mind have

2806.72 --> 2811.7599999999998
it have a goodbye

2808.0 --> 2814.24
i can't think of like a more not so

2811.76 --> 2814.8
specifically attuned to this show but in

2814.24 --> 2817.2799999999997
general

2814.8 --> 2818.7200000000003
something that will be kind of cool

2817.28 --> 2821.8390000000004
although i don't know maybe

2818.72 --> 2824.8799999999997
you'd get into trouble for it like

2821.839 --> 2827.359
miniature neil degrasse tysons

2824.88 --> 2830.0
when he has when he is bouncing the

2827.359 --> 2832.96
beach ball

2830.0 --> 2834.88
know that moment if you can like 3d

2832.96 --> 2836.4
capture that moment when he was doing

2834.88 --> 2837.76
that i think that there would be a whole

2836.4 --> 2839.359
range of people that would think that

2837.76 --> 2842.48
would be awesome to have

2839.359 --> 2843.2799999999997
within the flatter scene just a joyful

2842.48 --> 2845.28
idea

2843.28 --> 2848.2400000000002
you know in that direction because

2845.28 --> 2851.6800000000003
that's a that's like a 3d printout of a

2848.24 --> 2854.7999999999997
moment that's very memorable

2851.68 --> 2856.8799999999997
yeah for example i mean could you try

2854.8 --> 2858.079
something like that you know you know i

2856.88 --> 2860.88
mean you could 3d

2858.079 --> 2862.48
see the thing is 3d printing is it's not

2860.88 --> 2863.6800000000003
it's not like that finished product you

2862.48 --> 2865.119
know you would you'd be able to see that

2863.68 --> 2866.16
it looks like a neil degrasse but it

2865.119 --> 2867.839
wouldn't be

2866.16 --> 2869.2
colored and then and you know but you

2867.839 --> 2869.839
could paint him you could certainly

2869.2 --> 2871.9199999999996
paint him

2869.839 --> 2874.24
um and have him properly made like that

2871.92 --> 2877.76
airbrushed and and what have you

2874.24 --> 2879.52
um but yeah so i mean

2877.76 --> 2880.88
see these already ideas just you know

2879.52 --> 2881.52
that you're thinking of right now but

2880.88 --> 2883.28
you know maybe

2881.52 --> 2885.44
maybe with some time you'll you'll think

2883.28 --> 2886.1600000000003
of you know other ideas to add to those

2885.44 --> 2888.88
ideas but

2886.16 --> 2890.96
this idea is yours you know i gave it to

2888.88 --> 2892.96
you just now it's a very general idea

2890.96 --> 2894.16
and i think that would be a great start

2892.96 --> 2896.88
it's just

2894.16 --> 2899.1189999999997
these type like memorable statues of

2896.88 --> 2902.2400000000002
memorable moments that

2899.119 --> 2903.76
remind people of certain things

2902.24 --> 2905.4399999999996
i get what you're saying i i totally

2903.76 --> 2908.0
understand i'm just

2905.44 --> 2909.44
you know i'm i'm moving um you know the

2908.0 --> 2911.359
in the time of this all this

2909.44 --> 2912.559
this lockdown and restriction and all

2911.359 --> 2915.2
the rest of it you know

2912.559 --> 2916.96
the world is the ugliness in the world

2915.2 --> 2917.52
is starting to really rear its head and

2916.96 --> 2919.599
i'm

2917.52 --> 2920.88
i'm kind of fatigued by it all to be

2919.599 --> 2924.319
honest you know so

2920.88 --> 2928.6400000000003
yeah i i get that totally

2924.319 --> 2931.92
you know i just i'd rather

2928.64 --> 2936.24
i'd rather move away you know you know

2931.92 --> 2937.6800000000003
from it all and just you know create

2936.24 --> 2939.4399999999996
you know create the interaction where

2937.68 --> 2942.72
the interaction is already happening

2939.44 --> 2944.319
you know and work on that as well rather

2942.72 --> 2945.839
than

2944.319 --> 2948.079
you know trying to get involved with all

2945.839 --> 2950.0789999999997
the nastiness because some people feel

2948.079 --> 2950.8
best in this world pulling another down

2950.079 --> 2953.76
and

2950.8 --> 2955.3590000000004
to me that you know i've grown up with

2953.76 --> 2957.44
that and it

2955.359 --> 2958.88
it's not something i i wish on anyone

2957.44 --> 2962.64
that's for sure

2958.88 --> 2963.839
but you know um i just want you to know

2962.64 --> 2965.5989999999997
i just want you to know

2963.839 --> 2967.359
that that option's available to you even

2965.599 --> 2968.8
if you don't take me up on it you know

2967.359 --> 2970.88
uh

2968.8 --> 2972.2400000000002
right i will definitely keep it in the

2970.88 --> 2973.76
back of my mind

2972.24 --> 2976.24
that if there's something that just

2973.76 --> 2978.6400000000003
really that i just gotta do

2976.24 --> 2979.5989999999997
and it would fall in line with what you

2978.64 --> 2981.839
got

2979.599 --> 2983.119
yeah i will absolutely contact you about

2981.839 --> 2986.48
that

2983.119 --> 2990.1600000000003
yeah i mean my first design idea was to

2986.48 --> 2992.2400000000002
laser etch your early bird logo into a

2990.16 --> 2992.8799999999997
wooden coaster you know so it's a 3d

2992.24 --> 2995.2799999999997
etched

2992.88 --> 2996.2400000000002
coaster and that would take me all of

2995.28 --> 3000.0
three minutes

2996.24 --> 3000.4799999999996
you know yeah like a coaster for your

3000.0 --> 3002.16
drink

3000.48 --> 3004.559
or you know i've also got an attachment

3002.16 --> 3007.2
for my laser cutter oh okay right

3004.559 --> 3009.3590000000004
glasses and i can laser each flatter

3007.2 --> 3011.359
dirty bird onto the side of a glass

3009.359 --> 3013.2
and you know whatever you you know

3011.359 --> 3015.359
whatever you want including your logo

3013.2 --> 3017.52
and everything so you know these options

3015.359 --> 3018.96
that is you know interesting hundreds of

3017.52 --> 3020.96
dollars a pop

3018.96 --> 3022.4
and you know they're yours for free if

3020.96 --> 3026.16
you want to make a move on it

3022.4 --> 3028.559
yeah well just basic yeah basic

3026.16 --> 3030.319
high detail merchandising effects i

3028.559 --> 3031.52
don't mind that necessarily that's

3030.319 --> 3033.2
pretty interesting

3031.52 --> 3034.88
yeah and by the way i need to respond to

3033.2 --> 3036.72
chat for a second because good service

3034.88 --> 3040.48
keeps on saying this

3036.72 --> 3043.68
make an arwyn figurine no

3040.48 --> 3046.2400000000002
no no no like

3043.68 --> 3048.5589999999997
that's gonna that's that's a terrible

3046.24 --> 3048.5589999999997
idea

3048.72 --> 3051.839
just that makes me feel very

3050.48 --> 3055.359
uncomfortable

3051.839 --> 3056.64
you know maybe like a a modified

3055.359 --> 3059.359
figurine that kind of

3056.64 --> 3060.24
reminds you of me something but i'm not

3059.359 --> 3063.7599999999998
gonna be like

3060.24 --> 3066.3999999999996
look this is me my figurine you know

3063.76 --> 3068.88
giving people the option to like project

3066.4 --> 3073.04
weird [ __ ] onto that

3068.88 --> 3075.92
you know i idolatry what is it called

3073.04 --> 3078.4
ugh i don't feel very comfortable with

3075.92 --> 3078.4
that idea

3080.16 --> 3084.72
iron if he said 3d printers take a lot

3082.88 --> 3086.88
of tweaking to get a good result

3084.72 --> 3088.24
yep you're not lying there you're not

3086.88 --> 3091.28
lying it takes

3088.24 --> 3094.3999999999996
it takes a while i've seen uh

3091.28 --> 3097.3590000000004
somebody that i happen to follow on

3094.4 --> 3099.2000000000003
on yeah in video land it has nothing to

3097.359 --> 3100.48
do with the scene that i'm on and your

3099.2 --> 3104.0789999999997
own

3100.48 --> 3106.4
but he had somebody make a figurine

3104.079 --> 3107.92
with a good 3d printer like that as well

3106.4 --> 3110.48
of himself

3107.92 --> 3111.119
like as a ghostbuster because he liked

3110.48 --> 3113.839
her

3111.119 --> 3114.48
like in a ghostbusters suit and all that

3113.839 --> 3117.68
but

3114.48 --> 3119.76
yeah it kinda looked like him but it

3117.68 --> 3122.96
still didn't look like him

3119.76 --> 3124.079
because it's that is just unbelievably

3122.96 --> 3126.16
tough

3124.079 --> 3127.52
like you gotta have like basically

3126.16 --> 3131.44
somebody's face

3127.52 --> 3132.0
3d scanned in order to really get it

3131.44 --> 3135.44
right

3132.0 --> 3136.079
right correct because because otherwise

3135.44 --> 3139.44
if you're gonna

3136.079 --> 3139.92
just go on visual translation into 3d

3139.44 --> 3141.839
it's just

3139.92 --> 3143.119
it won't work out and even though on

3141.839 --> 3145.119
screen it might

3143.119 --> 3146.559
seem to work out when you then print it

3145.119 --> 3147.119
it doesn't work out you got to really

3146.559 --> 3149.92
have the

3147.119 --> 3152.319
perfect 3d coordinates and not the

3149.92 --> 3153.359
visual interpretation of what you're

3152.319 --> 3155.44
seeing

3153.359 --> 3157.119
that's right it might resemble them but

3155.44 --> 3160.2400000000002
it's not

3157.119 --> 3162.88
replicating them yeah a 3d model with

3160.24 --> 3164.319
a picture of somebody's face paste

3162.88 --> 3169.28
pasted over it

3164.319 --> 3169.2799999999997
does not look like the the real thing

3169.839 --> 3174.319
like that right yeah oh by the way yeah

3172.4 --> 3177.6800000000003
my show is ending

3174.319 --> 3179.44
so but thanks thanks for coming on for a
