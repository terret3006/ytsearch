5.97 --> 42.04
[Music]

37.92 --> 45.58
good morning welcome to flatter the

42.04 --> 50.019999999999996
earlybird number 138 I'm your host

45.58 --> 56.05
Arwen and today like yesterday it's a

50.02 --> 61.02
benefit rate a no wind no rain but yeah

56.05 --> 61.019999999999996
it's lip color think not too sure

68.36 --> 86.44
yeah yeah so yeah I had a pretty late

78.59 --> 92.68
night last night it's weird having some

86.44 --> 95.84
meta nice and blurry head that's some

92.68 --> 102.92
metabolic weird situation going on it's

95.84 --> 107.87
weird it's like it's almost like I have

102.92 --> 109.79
a cold but without actually having a

107.87 --> 116.0
cold it's kind of weird I got all sorts

109.79 --> 119.35000000000001
of side symptoms but I don't feel like I

116.0 --> 123.07
have a cold I don't have any

119.35 --> 126.11
inflammations anywhere no headache no

123.07 --> 131.59
sinus infection or anything or even my

126.11 --> 135.769
bronchial UNG's nothing but still yeah

131.59 --> 138.17000000000002
so yeah it's like I have a cold but with

135.769 --> 142.25
it without it actually fully manifested

138.17 --> 144.26
almost like a dormant cold it's weird it

142.25 --> 148.07
would surprise me though cause a lot of

144.26 --> 152.66
other flat-earthers I've known basically

148.07 --> 155.63
said that they did have a cold and yeah

152.66 --> 159.25
I think colds are purely psychosomatic

155.63 --> 163.1
and have to do with metabolic changes

159.25 --> 167.0
likely in response to the change in the

163.1 --> 170.48
energy swing of the pendulum the be

167.0 --> 176.48
either you could call it and while

170.48 --> 179.78
considering my lifestyle I seem to be

176.48 --> 183.26
less vulnerable to the full weight of

179.78 --> 186.86
off colds anymore and I don't really get

183.26 --> 191.14999999999998
colds but sometimes I do get like period

186.86 --> 194.299
when I feel a little bit weaker and I

191.15 --> 198.02
have a lot of trouble focusing recently

194.299 --> 199.22
it's very weird like can't concentrate

198.02 --> 202.97
as

199.22 --> 205.91
as long on something I get lost in my

202.97 --> 208.24
mind it's a side effect to this just

205.91 --> 210.68
don't feel up to my full capability

208.24 --> 212.63
typically cold by the way cuz people

210.68 --> 214.55
that have a cold half this too and then

212.63 --> 217.13
they think oh it's the distraction from

214.55 --> 219.23000000000002
some inflammation that is causing me to

217.13 --> 221.78
lose focus I don't really have that but

219.23 --> 225.70999999999998
I lose focus anyway it's weird

221.78 --> 228.65
I was yeah with the whole Flat Earth

225.71 --> 231.59
debate and and John quantum eraser now

228.65 --> 234.56
acting like Johnny Globe had well then

231.59 --> 239.8
basically trying to go in the grill the

234.56 --> 242.39000000000001
panel on university level argumentum and

239.8 --> 245.48000000000002
he was like saying okay say it the right

242.39 --> 247.80999999999997
way and I could I've felt so typically

245.48 --> 251.0
like I was in class again in school

247.81 --> 254.0
where I watch very much in the same type

251.0 --> 260.27
of mood as this a lot like being really

254.0 --> 262.97
distracted not having inner drive to

260.27 --> 265.94
really go on that edge so I was

262.97 --> 270.83000000000004
basically lazying around a lot but then

265.94 --> 273.29
eventually yeah I would get ready to do

270.83 --> 275.47999999999996
it and in the world would all work out

273.29 --> 279.23
so yeah I did manage to finish school

275.48 --> 281.45000000000005
even with this state a lot it's funny

279.23 --> 283.93
although ya didn't also get a lot of

281.45 --> 287.99
colds back then didn't eat organic

283.93 --> 290.15000000000003
specifically it was fooling around not

287.99 --> 297.83
very conscious of my own personal

290.15 --> 299.56
maintenance and the cycles right over

297.83 --> 305.12
muku weather change

299.56 --> 307.43
yeah the cycle and weather I don't think

305.12 --> 312.98
the weather change really causes it I

307.43 --> 317.62
think that the metabolic change comes in

312.98 --> 317.62
response psychosomatic response to it

323.159 --> 330.389
but yeah a big change or a rapid change

327.719 --> 333.649
in weather does seem to trigger it more

330.389 --> 337.619
often so I agree on that

333.649 --> 341.669
anyway let's see who's in chat hmm quite

337.619 --> 346.73900000000003
busy here and chat let's see hello Steve

341.669 --> 359.339
accurate wells hm brand m and glacier

346.739 --> 364.06899999999996
into musical nothing happening michael

359.339 --> 364.069
roark see you Rome

367.07 --> 377.84
Shane Walter BK k Dave yeah

372.89 --> 382.59999999999997
good to see you all yeah sorry this time

377.84 --> 387.5
I didn't get a list because to be fair

382.6 --> 390.62
also in response to this state and being

387.5 --> 393.61
felt or feeling like I was kind of made

390.62 --> 396.56
a fool of myself on the debates a little

393.61 --> 399.11
because I couldn't focus I pretty much

396.56 --> 402.67
didn't watch a lot of videos after that

399.11 --> 406.22
and just watch Netflix and series and

402.67 --> 408.40000000000003
kept it pretty basic so don't have a lot

406.22 --> 413.36
of super interesting things to report

408.4 --> 417.5
unfortunately did see a couple of video

413.36 --> 422.54
pop up but because I stayed up pretty

417.5 --> 427.37
late I got up pretty late one o'clock

422.54 --> 430.67
actually and didn't have a lot of time

427.37 --> 433.07
altogether to watch everything I haven't

430.67 --> 435.74
seen Owen Benjamin's video although it

433.07 --> 438.05
was pretty short been watching a little

435.74 --> 439.81
bit of Alex Jones and everything's just

438.05 --> 447.56
steady as she goes

439.81 --> 452.99
same subjects gotta talk about space war

447.56 --> 456.37
between Russia and America we great idea

452.99 --> 456.37
so the idea

459.97 --> 462.66
see

464.05 --> 474.449
oh yeah Jared nism did a video as well

467.58 --> 477.96
let's see how big that was it is Mary

474.449 --> 477.96000000000004
advertisements curry

478.38 --> 483.39
oh yeah I was a very short man as eight

481.2 --> 487.37
minutes as well yeah another lot of

483.39 --> 487.37
material to reflect upon right now

493.3 --> 501.22
huh bill gee no I didn't see that China

498.7 --> 504.90999999999997
apparently teleported something into

501.22 --> 512.89
space that's that's hilarious and

504.91 --> 515.6800000000001
interesting though what did they do did

512.89 --> 517.78
they teleport like a molecule into space

515.68 --> 520.7399999999999
because there's been talk of that kind

517.78 --> 523.4499999999999
of thing a lot look the whole

520.74 --> 526.45
teleportation science fiction you could

523.45 --> 528.2800000000001
call it or perhaps there is way more to

526.45 --> 532.7800000000001
it and this is just the way the media is

528.28 --> 534.1899999999999
playing with it in public but I remember

532.78 --> 536.62
for a long time like oh yeah

534.19 --> 539.32
teleportation could be possible but it's

536.62 --> 543.27
gonna be on a molecule basis cuz it's

539.32 --> 545.71
too complex and apparently I remember

543.27 --> 549.22
scientists even ten years ago we

545.71 --> 551.26
teleported a molecule or something and

549.22 --> 554.58
we would like yay

551.26 --> 557.77
Star Trek teleportation is coming closer

554.58 --> 560.5
but yeah I never really kept up to date

557.77 --> 564.39
with everything they tried since then

560.5 --> 568.27
because now it's just giant spam of

564.39 --> 570.54
science fiction these days so I don't

568.27 --> 570.54
know

572.71 --> 583.589
what did they apparently teleport into

575.95 --> 583.589
space bilgey please share with me right

588.31 --> 592.02
oh yeah

594.01 --> 597.139
[Music]

604.19 --> 617.0
right nothing happening a cold well all

612.319 --> 619.7299999999999
right okay maybe I got a cold it's is it

617.0 --> 629.629
yeah the flu a cold I don't know it's

619.73 --> 631.72
kind of mixed up it's weird because in

629.629 --> 635.269
the Dutch way of saying it

631.72 --> 640.129
there's no direct tie-in with the

635.269 --> 647.689
English Way to that detail it out what

640.129 --> 651.879
it is I guess a cold yeah it wait now

647.689 --> 653.569
there are kind of relations to think hmm

651.879 --> 656.66
so yeah I guess

653.569 --> 659.4699999999999
okay a cold but I don't yeah it really

656.66 --> 663.23
feels like a typical metabolic or

659.47 --> 665.2090000000001
transition stage thing that I guess a

663.23 --> 669.0500000000001
lot of people think is some kind of

665.209 --> 671.1199999999999
virus or dormant like a virus that's

669.05 --> 673.399
very easily overcome and everybody gets

671.12 --> 676.3100000000001
it but yeah I don't think it's a virus I

673.399 --> 684.199
think it's a metabolic change that is

676.31 --> 686.75
pretty standard to - I don't know animal

684.199 --> 689.24
life I guess I don't know how many

686.75 --> 691.73
creatures how many animal types do

689.24 --> 695.689
actually have this type of metabolic

691.73 --> 698.0
change like a cold I think a lot of them

695.689 --> 702.5
do especially in response to

698.0 --> 707.36
psychosomatic changes like an animal

702.5 --> 710.389
that suddenly yeah yeah a pet animal in

707.36 --> 712.88
in some kind of cage or aquarium that

710.389 --> 718.99
would suddenly change to a totally new

712.88 --> 722.329
environment they might like get a little

718.99 --> 724.879
unnerved little sickly maybe even get

722.329 --> 727.2199999999999
sort of cold symptoms I don't know

724.879 --> 729.0500000000001
depending on the type of creature it

727.22 --> 732.139
might actually be really dangerous or

729.05 --> 736.7299999999999
not so much but I think that animals

732.139 --> 737.48
probably have similar effects it's just

736.73 --> 740.66
a metabolic

737.48 --> 743.6
change to adapt in response to the heavy

740.66 --> 750.86
psychosomatic changes or atmospheric

743.6 --> 753.4300000000001
shift anyway yeah a cold okay I guess

750.86 --> 753.4300000000001
it's a cold

762.42 --> 768.13
all right

764.95 --> 772.5
well and Galatia I'm I'm not really

768.13 --> 778.24
settled or really on what viruses are I

772.5 --> 784.449
think the conventional bacterial and

778.24 --> 790.3
virus invasion concept is oversimplified

784.449 --> 793.899
and probably not exactly like that so I

790.3 --> 799.5699999999999
don't know it depends on what type of

793.899 --> 803.079
virus it is what the nature of it how

799.57 --> 806.35
dangerous it could be I think that if

803.079 --> 808.449
you're really healthy like and in a good

806.35 --> 812.529
frequency where you're basically not

808.449 --> 816.18
weakened like this you could you could

812.529 --> 819.519
probably take any kind of virus

816.18 --> 823.54
externally as long as you're strong and

819.519 --> 830.11
your body would just not become viable

823.54 --> 831.79
to it I don't know I've never had a lot

830.11 --> 838.029
of trust in the whole concept of

831.79 --> 840.7199999999999
bacterial or virus infection by biology

838.029 --> 846.73
I understand how it's supposed to work

840.72 --> 849.4590000000001
but I just never found a lot of tie in

846.73 --> 852.25
with the real world except for it's just

849.459 --> 854.399
so stories in people that believe what

852.25 --> 858.209
the doctor tells them how it works

854.399 --> 858.209
that's all really

862.95 --> 870.48
your auntie oh god there's glowy dead

872.04 --> 883.019
you forgot to be there alright go life

878.589 --> 883.019
tonight it's cool

885.61 --> 888.87
a leb

890.81 --> 897.0799999999999
hey if any of you want to get on my

893.57 --> 901.19
panel I got the Hangout system

897.08 --> 908.63
reintegrated with OBS I already put the

901.19 --> 912.0500000000001
link out there and chat nobody pretty

908.63 --> 915.11
much talked over it in the master B but

912.05 --> 917.2099999999999
yeah I am open for panelists we're very

915.11 --> 923.57
welcome to see somebody on the panel

917.21 --> 926.0
again it's been days so hey Ali if you

923.57 --> 929.0200000000001
want to come on and talk about anything

926.0 --> 931.91
that would be cool

929.02 --> 934.39
Iran T you're also welcome or both of

931.91 --> 938.0899999999999
you join we could talk about some

934.39 --> 940.36
supernatural stuff always seems to work

938.09 --> 940.36
out

944.37 --> 946.37
ah

948.52 --> 957.459
damn bill gee really flat smacking

952.93 --> 961.5699999999999
calling random business that sounds kind

957.459 --> 965.68
of troll ish I don't know I think that's

961.57 --> 969.61
more tip I wouldn't yeah That's not me

965.68 --> 974.4699999999999
you know not for this show anyway sounds

969.61 --> 978.7
much more like Horace that's more what

974.47 --> 983.32
hoary would do he's a real flat smacker

978.7 --> 988.96
breaking up out of nowhere okay Allie be

983.32 --> 995.38
cool yeah let's go get that coffee

988.96 --> 995.38
[Music]

997.99 --> 1004.98
yeah I also have been noticing that this

1000.93 --> 1006.87
microphone is a lot more sensitive to me

1004.98 --> 1010.2
moving around on the table then the

1006.87 --> 1012.09
other one was it's kind of annoying it's

1010.2 --> 1016.97
like a negative side effect but I have

1012.09 --> 1019.58
to pay more attention to what I do here

1016.97 --> 1023.73
hey hey

1019.58 --> 1026.82
hello ranty welcome to the panel how's

1023.73 --> 1030.3
it going yeah going good and a little

1026.82 --> 1033.1499999999999
slow I think but yeah doing alright

1030.3 --> 1035.55
haven't touched the wine or any alcohol

1033.15 --> 1038.8200000000002
in two days might also have something to

1035.55 --> 1043.98
do with it you feeling alright

1038.82 --> 1047.28
huh you feel it alright well it's kind

1043.98 --> 1049.89
of like a feel bit slowed down almost

1047.28 --> 1052.44
like I have a cold but not the usual

1049.89 --> 1056.97
typical symptoms no inflammations or

1052.44 --> 1061.3500000000001
anything but yeah I was a little slow

1056.97 --> 1065.3600000000001
under the bed yesterday as well it's

1061.35 --> 1070.28
very typical right and how are you doing

1065.36 --> 1070.28
doing good um yeah doing good

1070.88 --> 1076.23
went and did an observation yesterday

1073.14 --> 1080.4
was pretty cool and I'll probably show

1076.23 --> 1082.95
this stuff later on yeah man it was a it

1080.4 --> 1086.94
was a journey and a half italia cuz my

1082.95 --> 1089.39
part my car blew up so as I don't have a

1086.94 --> 1089.39
car now

1089.96 --> 1099.75
so no no no no I mean you know I mean it

1096.99 --> 1101.67
blew the head gasket went on it and it

1099.75 --> 1103.44
also crushed a piston at the same time

1101.67 --> 1103.8000000000002
and something to do with the wash as

1103.44 --> 1106.6100000000001
well

1103.8 --> 1111.06
so yeah it kinda bout the catastrophic

1106.61 --> 1113.1899999999998
meltdown didn't collapse yeah so it's

1111.06 --> 1116.1299999999999
been in the get it was taken to the

1113.19 --> 1120.81
galleries last Friday they said to us it

1116.13 --> 1123.93
would be repaired by Tuesday so about

1120.81 --> 1125.85
Tuesday tea time we'd have it so Tuesday

1123.93 --> 1127.8300000000002
tea time comes and I'm thinking yeah can

1125.85 --> 1128.2199999999998
drive down there get the car not a

1127.83 --> 1130.4499999999998
problem

1128.22 --> 1133.869
oh no it's not ready yet

1130.45 --> 1135.669
Oh Wednesday morning Wednesday morning

1133.869 --> 1137.799
at the latest well I had a choice them I

1135.669 --> 1139.1490000000001
waited Wednesday morning Tinley repaired

1137.799 --> 1141.6689999999999
it and then stuff I wouldn't get down

1139.149 --> 1143.529
there in time so I decided to hop on the

1141.669 --> 1146.3500000000001
train instead so that was four changes

1143.529 --> 1151.259
on the train to get down to Wales

1146.35 --> 1155.559
- with all the equipment in a suitcase

1151.259 --> 1158.47
okay yeah and then get picked up from

1155.559 --> 1160.539
the train station and then taken to the

1158.47 --> 1166.69
place to do the observation and then

1160.539 --> 1167.95
those guys left and me and Spurs chemo

1166.69 --> 1170.6490000000001
because he came down as well on the

1167.95 --> 1172.8400000000001
train and so he met me there so the two

1170.649 --> 1174.6689999999999
of us there freezing our nuts off down

1172.84 --> 1176.35
on the promenade for about four hours

1174.669 --> 1178.21
because we didn't have a place to go and

1176.35 --> 1179.98
shelter you know because we didn't have

1178.21 --> 1181.3890000000001
a car oh man and it's happened I got

1179.98 --> 1183.549
home it was about nan o'clock at night

1181.389 --> 1185.1689999999999
it was just a seriously long day how and

1183.549 --> 1187.69
then I got we're gonna get home I was

1185.169 --> 1190.45
learning at home find out that the the

1187.69 --> 1192.009
car the den told was that it was the

1190.45 --> 1194.1390000000001
head gasket which we told him it was

1192.009 --> 1195.94
head gasket anyway they then came back

1194.139 --> 1197.4699999999998
to us firstly because he said it wasn't

1195.94 --> 1198.8790000000001
the head gasket they needed to do all

1197.47 --> 1200.799
the other works that did all that and

1198.879 --> 1202.119
then they said oh no is the head gasket

1200.799 --> 1207.129
now so we're not gonna have the car

1202.119 --> 1209.019
ready till next week next week I'm gonna

1207.129 --> 1213.82
have you got a courtesy car then no all

1209.019 --> 1217.33
courtesy cars are out what yeah that's

1213.82 --> 1219.279
really annoying well anyway yeah the

1217.33 --> 1222.22
weather was ok I mean it was really

1219.279 --> 1223.84
weird it was we had be the Sun was

1222.22 --> 1227.169
behind us we had a lot of glare on the

1223.84 --> 1228.639
screen so it was really difficult I mean

1227.169 --> 1230.019
I learnt a lot I'll be honest there was

1228.639 --> 1232.269
a lot of things I could have done better

1230.019 --> 1234.609
there's a lot of things that I could

1232.269 --> 1237.789
have thought about in you know planned

1234.609 --> 1239.82
for which I didn't think about so it was

1237.789 --> 1242.739
a really big learning curve to be honest

1239.82 --> 1245.529
I learned a lot yesterday through the

1242.739 --> 1247.809
mistakes that that went on and also

1245.529 --> 1249.94
perspective my perspective versus their

1247.809 --> 1251.59
perspective so they're on the boat and

1249.94 --> 1253.45
they were telling me oh no we haven't

1251.59 --> 1255.4889999999998
passed Great Orme yet or we haven't gone

1253.45 --> 1258.3400000000001
to the wind turbines yet but from my

1255.489 --> 1260.95
perspective had sin pass the wind

1258.34 --> 1263.83
turbines and pass great orme so so I'm

1260.95 --> 1267.15
trying to find out which boat they were

1263.83 --> 1269.08
by triangulating them that way and

1267.15 --> 1271.9
they're telling me they're in one

1269.08 --> 1273.31
location whereas I'm not seeing them in

1271.9 --> 1274.9
that location I'm seeing them in a

1273.31 --> 1276.31
completely different location I'm pretty

1274.9 --> 1278.92
sure it's that bolt and then it's like

1276.31 --> 1281.05
no no we're definitely here but it was

1278.92 --> 1284.41
all due to their their perspective

1281.05 --> 1287.83
versus my perspective did you use GPS

1284.41 --> 1291.76
trackers well that was the only kind of

1287.83 --> 1294.58
Handy GPS on the boat and those GPS on

1291.76 --> 1296.2
the the drones and stuff but this is

1294.58 --> 1299.5
like say one thing I learned it was like

1296.2 --> 1301.42
I had a suitcase full of equipment and I

1299.5 --> 1302.95
didn't have enough room to to bring

1301.42 --> 1304.72
everything that I needed I could have

1302.95 --> 1306.52
taken my laptop as well and stuff you

1304.72 --> 1307.81
know so there's a whole bunch of stuff

1306.52 --> 1309.76
that I should have took that didn't have

1307.81 --> 1311.59
room for you know taking it on the train

1309.76 --> 1314.71
right and didn't have a computer

1311.59 --> 1316.4199999999998
interface no oh no this is tough though

1314.71 --> 1319.81
yeah it was really it was really really

1316.42 --> 1321.8200000000002
difficult difficult conditions Tony

1319.81 --> 1323.3799999999999
didn't show up he let me down last

1321.82 --> 1325.6
minute he was supposed to show up he was

1323.38 --> 1328.1200000000001
supposed to be there so I had spurs

1325.6 --> 1331.87
chemo there who's never operated a p900

1328.12 --> 1335.02
before ap1000 so I had two cameras only

1331.87 --> 1337.1799999999998
I could operate any of them because

1335.02 --> 1339.16
Spurs got Spurs couldn't do it

1337.18 --> 1342.5800000000002
Tony could he used the other one but of

1339.16 --> 1343.78
course he wasn't there and yeah he just

1342.58 --> 1346.09
seen where there was a lot of lessons

1343.78 --> 1347.59
learned yesterday and but we did get

1346.09 --> 1349.2099999999998
we've got some results at the end of it

1347.59 --> 1353.02
so that that's the main thing you know

1349.21 --> 1355.24
okay that main thing yeah glad you got

1353.02 --> 1358.3899999999999
something out of it hey by the way hello

1355.24 --> 1360.76
Ali B and you don't have you doing

1358.39 --> 1364.93
running hey how's it going pally you're

1360.76 --> 1367.6299999999999
right yeah yeah sorry it was a good day

1364.93 --> 1369.46
yesterday then run here oh yeah he was

1367.63 --> 1371.44
it was a it was a good day after say the

1369.46 --> 1375.18
guys that we've met down there that the

1371.44 --> 1378.13
other flat earthers excellent guys

1375.18 --> 1380.02
everyone took a day off work so if you

1378.13 --> 1381.49
think about all the lost wages two

1380.02 --> 1383.8
hundred and fifty quid to hire the boat

1381.49 --> 1386.35
you know it cost me in total with taxis

1383.8 --> 1389.05
and train it took the cost me around

1386.35 --> 1390.58
about eighty quid to go actually just

1389.05 --> 1392.5
get to the locations first probably

1390.58 --> 1395.4099999999999
spent in the same so when you add it all

1392.5 --> 1397.12
up probably this one observation in lost

1395.41 --> 1400.9
earnings plus what it costs probably

1397.12 --> 1403.54
most what 1500 quid maybe you know just

1400.9 --> 1405.88
to go and or and five people actually

1403.54 --> 1408.37
putting this together to go out of the

1405.88 --> 1410.5300000000002
way and actually this although yeah I

1408.37 --> 1413.1699999999998
mean it was awesome it was worth to tear

1410.53 --> 1415.78
it was worth it you know it's just yeah

1413.17 --> 1417.8500000000001
the weather could have been better if it

1415.78 --> 1420.07
had been brighter you know I think if it

1417.85 --> 1422.26
didn't Brad he would have sin being able

1420.07 --> 1424.0
to pick them up a lot a lot earlier the

1422.26 --> 1425.62
time I actually picked them up it was

1424.0 --> 1427.27
close to them wanting to come back

1425.62 --> 1429.4289999999999
because the guy has to come back because

1427.27 --> 1431.41
it's high tide and his boat is in

1429.429 --> 1433.51
estuary he can only leave and come back

1431.41 --> 1435.3400000000001
at high tide how gold can't stay out too

1433.51 --> 1439.78
low tide so there's a very narrow window

1435.34 --> 1441.61
and but it's like when like like what

1439.78 --> 1444.28
you're saying even even nothing it

1441.61 --> 1446.02
wasn't the the base this base this

1444.28 --> 1449.59
you've you've learned a lot and maybe

1446.02 --> 1451.72
people can know faint tune these and up

1449.59 --> 1453.28
all call an experiment because there's a

1451.72 --> 1455.17
phenomenon the phenomenon of war

1453.28 --> 1458.44
apparently does that feel more like a so

1455.17 --> 1459.97
I'll call an experiment or measurements

1458.44 --> 1462.76
but I'll call an experiment because I

1459.97 --> 1466.03
see as an experiment your taste and if

1462.76 --> 1468.04
for the cough and you're using a you're

1466.03 --> 1470.26
using instruments to test those exact

1468.04 --> 1474.04
same as a scientific experiment again

1470.26 --> 1474.91
well yeah I know about scene forgetting

1474.04 --> 1477.9099999999999
all those tests

1474.91 --> 1479.6200000000001
it's a test and it will yield some good

1477.91 --> 1483.7
information the preliminary information

1479.62 --> 1487.12
that anyone that wants to research this

1483.7 --> 1490.99
deeper can use as like intro knowledge

1487.12 --> 1493.4499999999998
to plan out there yeah so yeah you

1490.99 --> 1496.3
scouted some of the obstacles Randy

1493.45 --> 1497.92
well done thanks for that well yeah I

1496.3 --> 1499.84
mean there's no point lying about it

1497.92 --> 1504.76
could like I say that things could have

1499.84 --> 1508.6899999999998
been done better essentially we did what

1504.76 --> 1511.179
we learned a lot more than we would have

1508.69 --> 1512.3200000000002
done if we did wait till summertime it's

1511.179 --> 1513.3700000000001
better to get these errors out of the

1512.32 --> 1515.5
way now

1513.37 --> 1517.0
and also the loss of signal and stuff

1515.5 --> 1519.309
and and the bulk captain he was a

1517.0 --> 1522.55
[ __ ] he was a glow he was a glow go

1519.309 --> 1524.11
ah who's a girl but right and they said

1522.55 --> 1526.09
to him what we'd planned or whatever you

1524.11 --> 1528.25
knows to his left and instead of going

1526.09 --> 1530.62
where I'd told you I give him GPS

1528.25 --> 1533.32
coordinates to head to and

1530.62 --> 1536.26
this is what was so confusing I told him

1533.32 --> 1538.059
where I wanted him to go and instead he

1536.26 --> 1539.89
went to somewhere else he went to the

1538.059 --> 1541.59
Douglass complex so he just shut off

1539.89 --> 1544.24
straight to the dog was complex

1541.59 --> 1547.33
completely didn't go to the the Reese

1544.24 --> 1548.77
flats where I wanted him to go so when

1547.33 --> 1549.9399999999998
these guys were on the belt telling me

1548.77 --> 1551.77
yeah we're just coming up to the wind

1549.94 --> 1554.71
turbines I'm looking for them at the

1551.77 --> 1556.59
Reese flat real flat and the nut that

1554.71 --> 1560.3500000000001
not at the real flats at all they're at

1556.59 --> 1562.87
where wente more so completely different

1560.35 --> 1564.34
wind turbines everyone was really

1562.87 --> 1566.4399999999998
confused about what was going on and

1564.34 --> 1569.11
eventually why did he do that that

1566.44 --> 1571.3600000000001
sounds like sabotage well yeah I mean it

1569.11 --> 1572.6499999999999
doesn't it and it also it sounded when

1571.36 --> 1573.9399999999998
they were talking to him on the belt

1572.65 --> 1576.5800000000002
about what they were doing and blah blah

1573.94 --> 1578.23
and and he says oh well he's a globe

1576.58 --> 1582.1599999999999
earth and he thought that we were all we

1578.23 --> 1583.15
were all ridiculous he thought we were

1582.16 --> 1585.75
all ridiculous

1583.15 --> 1588.46
so essentially didn't give us much help

1585.75 --> 1589.9
right but it was voluntary right you

1588.46 --> 1592.8400000000001
didn't pay for him to do that

1589.9 --> 1597.429
hey two hundred and fifty quid oh you

1592.84 --> 1599.4099999999999
did yeah well that's really bad you know

1597.429 --> 1601.45
if he was just doing it voluntary and

1599.41 --> 1603.64
then find out that he didn't actually

1601.45 --> 1605.0800000000002
want to do it to get in the way yeah

1603.64 --> 1608.2900000000002
that's being a dick but if you actually

1605.08 --> 1612.52
paid him for it and any sabotage that is

1608.29 --> 1615.58
I don't know breaking it's breaking a

1612.52 --> 1619.48
culture yes well you could potentially

1615.58 --> 1621.87
sue him for that or you could have

1619.48 --> 1624.46
demanded your money back by yeah in

1621.87 --> 1626.59
water it's just an experience but I

1624.46 --> 1630.429
think I think it uh uh uh Hrothgar

1626.59 --> 1633.25
getting you a you Arwen and irani yeah

1630.429 --> 1635.38
it does sound a little bit like sabotage

1633.25 --> 1638.559
if he was government coordinates he just

1635.38 --> 1640.99
plugs the monies as a as directional

1638.559 --> 1643.75
thing no in the a plan is he sporting

1640.99 --> 1646.51
the ball and that would steal him have

1643.75 --> 1647.8
you seen my screen yeah yeah I'll show

1646.51 --> 1650.65
you where I told him I wanted him to

1647.8 --> 1653.08
head to this coordinate here I wanted

1650.65 --> 1655.24
him to go to this turbine or as close to

1653.08 --> 1657.58
it and then I wanted him to work work

1655.24 --> 1660.61
his way down this these turbines in this

1657.58 --> 1662.8
lying huh and then move into here into

1660.61 --> 1664.4799999999998
this open space so I had a clear line of

1662.8 --> 1666.37
sight of him that's why I wanted him to

1664.48 --> 1667.63
and this was the route it took he just

1666.37 --> 1669.3999999999999
came straight out of there

1667.63 --> 1671.65
straight over straight over here

1669.4 --> 1673.9
straight over there and long yeah that's

1671.65 --> 1676.27
what he did so when they're saying to me

1673.9 --> 1677.71
all were near the turbines now they were

1676.27 --> 1679.99
they thought they were heading to this

1677.71 --> 1682.06
turbine the captain's drive into this

1679.99 --> 1683.89
turbine I am looking for them in this

1682.06 --> 1685.57
direction and then

1683.89 --> 1687.76
oh yeah we're in the turbines now and

1685.57 --> 1689.29
I'm like I don't see ya can't see me and

1687.76 --> 1691.39
they're saying yet when it turned out

1689.29 --> 1692.98
they were in these wind turbines here so

1691.39 --> 1695.2
we'll look in completely the different

1692.98 --> 1696.82
direction to each other it was just it

1695.2 --> 1700.18
took such a long time to get anything

1696.82 --> 1702.28
organized and I you know that my plan

1700.18 --> 1703.96
was like SATA for him to go there

1702.28 --> 1708.3999999999999
instead of which he went directly to

1703.96 --> 1711.64
here so I'll show you something really

1708.4 --> 1712.72
cool right so not showing this to

1711.64 --> 1716.23
anybody before so you're gonna get a

1712.72 --> 1718.9
prelim at this yeah this is on the the

1716.23 --> 1721.21
right-hand side we've got a boat and

1718.9 --> 1723.3400000000001
it's gonna cross the screen and go to

1721.21 --> 1725.65
the left and what it does is it goes

1723.34 --> 1728.74
behind the turbines right this is really

1725.65 --> 1731.5300000000002
important so it goes behind these

1728.74 --> 1734.29
turbines now these turbines in the

1731.53 --> 1736.6
distance are some 12 miles away right

1734.29 --> 1739.24
the elevation of the camera is about 7

1736.6 --> 1742.0
feet above actual sea level so this

1739.24 --> 1745.39
should be approximately 50 feet or so of

1742.0 --> 1747.46
curve right and watch this both those

1745.39 --> 1749.7700000000002
behind the winter there goes behind the

1747.46 --> 1752.44
winter boat crosses over it's just a

1749.77 --> 1755.62
small fishing boat no way yeah

1752.44 --> 1758.44
behind the turbine again right now

1755.62 --> 1762.07
that's impossible on a globe it can't go

1758.44 --> 1765.4
behind it can't go behind those wind

1762.07 --> 1767.23
turbines are too far away to see any of

1765.4 --> 1769.51
the boat and it's only a small fishing

1767.23 --> 1772.3
boats only 14 4 or 12 bucks at the top

1769.51 --> 1775.02
of the boat and you'll see in a moment

1772.3 --> 1777.73
again it it passes through here it goes

1775.02 --> 1779.71
behind the turbines I've got loads of

1777.73 --> 1784.75
these going behind the turbine so it's

1779.71 --> 1785.98
not a one-off so there you go crystal I

1784.75 --> 1788.14
don't think you should believe what

1785.98 --> 1793.72
we'll see Neil that summer that's that's

1788.14 --> 1795.43
coming from loading to kill what I sound

1793.72 --> 1797.48
lovely but a footage by the way looks

1795.43 --> 1799.13
really handsome must good evening

1797.48 --> 1801.35
that's good yeah I put your own back on

1799.13 --> 1803.21
presentation mode again I had to build

1801.35 --> 1806.33
it first because I was screwed over but

1803.21 --> 1809.54
yeah amazing stuff behind the turbine

1806.33 --> 1812.6
because he goes behind the turbine it

1809.54 --> 1813.32
places it in a in a position you know be

1812.6 --> 1816.549
awesome

1813.32 --> 1819.53
awesome as I'm there for this point

1816.549 --> 1821.4189999999999
there's so much that that we learn well

1819.53 --> 1823.37
I was I've been looking through the

1821.419 --> 1824.0900000000001
observations and it's just so much good

1823.37 --> 1827.1499999999999
stuff in here

1824.09 --> 1829.49
so much good stuff I could I could

1827.15 --> 1830.66
literally just put video after video out

1829.49 --> 1832.49
for a year but the funny thing is

1830.66 --> 1834.559
because I have such a small screen when

1832.49 --> 1836.66
I'm view trying to film this store I

1834.559 --> 1838.97
wasn't sure about half the stuff I was

1836.66 --> 1840.8600000000001
even capturing because the the glare on

1838.97 --> 1842.84
the screen and been in it's only like

1840.86 --> 1845.03
about three inches by two inches the

1842.84 --> 1848.03
screen that I'm looking at and now I'm

1845.03 --> 1850.76
looking at and a big 32 inch TV so I can

1848.03 --> 1852.77
I can pick the things out a lot of this

1850.76 --> 1854.66
stuff passed me by on the day because it

1852.77 --> 1856.7
was just so murky it you know the

1854.66 --> 1859.76
weather appeared murky but that the 4k

1856.7 --> 1862.52
picks everything out so so hey tomatoes

1859.76 --> 1866.75
Randy yeah how far away was this yeah

1862.52 --> 1870.53
well I'll show you so here's is where we

1866.75 --> 1880.429
were filming from seven feet above sea

1870.53 --> 1882.1399999999999
level so boom right there right so so

1880.429 --> 1884.24
it's we're not looking through North

1882.14 --> 1885.47
hail oil which you're on the right if

1884.24 --> 1888.309
we're not looking through those turbines

1885.47 --> 1890.96
looking through these turbines here yeah

1888.309 --> 1892.79
they're looking through the turbines so

1890.96 --> 1893.83
when we go through these two central

1892.79 --> 1896.09
ones that we were looking through

1893.83 --> 1899.3899999999999
straightaway already in this position

1896.09 --> 1904.07
with 9.6 miles away here right at this

1899.39 --> 1905.929
position this is nine point six and this

1904.07 --> 1910.22
is where the bolt was traversing back

1905.929 --> 1912.049
and forth in this location here so the

1910.22 --> 1914.39
distance to the boat was thirteen point

1912.049 --> 1917.24
five miles away there's Douglass complex

1914.39 --> 1919.94
behind so I've just put sort of saw like

1917.24 --> 1924.47
a marker around it to give it some kind

1919.94 --> 1926.1200000000001
of structural design but this is this is

1924.47 --> 1929.75
the coordinates that the boat was taken

1926.12 --> 1931.7199999999998
across this line back and forth thirteen

1929.75 --> 1935.33
point five one miles away

1931.72 --> 1937.19
or thirteen and a half miles so that's

1935.33 --> 1939.5
that's quite a long way from a

1937.19 --> 1943.669
seven-foot elevation above sea level to

1939.5 --> 1949.46
see that boat just as we did go behind

1943.669 --> 1952.5890000000002
those two bones yeah there we go

1949.46 --> 1952.589
[Music]

1954.88 --> 1960.14
we've got behind the turbine boom that

1958.309 --> 1962.269
already places it over six point nine

1960.14 --> 1964.5490000000002
point six miles away so if anybody wants

1962.269 --> 1967.13
to argue that already places it over

1964.549 --> 1968.75
nine point six miles away right so none

1967.13 --> 1970.5800000000002
of that bulk should be seen from seven

1968.75 --> 1973.399
file evasion at nine point six half

1970.58 --> 1975.559
goodnight so that that kind of light so

1973.399 --> 1977.51
anybody wants to argue that first point

1975.559 --> 1979.789
the first point is the goals it goes

1977.51 --> 1982.07
behind the turbos right there you go

1979.789 --> 1986.57
it's behind that to vote yeah it's not

1982.07 --> 1992.12
in front of it behind it so straight

1986.57 --> 1994.519
away they can argue all the one and this

1992.12 --> 1995.9289999999999
is the this is it this is just it was

1994.519 --> 1997.639
just a glorious day that there seems to

1995.929 --> 2001.69
be very little refraction going on very

1997.639 --> 2005.25
little mirages in it was actually bought

2001.69 --> 2005.25
round two yes my satchel

2005.26 --> 2013.71
I'm going to say categorically can I say

2009.909 --> 2016.419
that that is the boat no I can't

2013.71 --> 2020.3500000000001
100% say that that is the bolt that they

2016.419 --> 2023.26
were on have you got a picture on the

2020.35 --> 2025.0
board that they went on yeah it's blue

2023.26 --> 2027.399
at the bottom and it has white at the

2025.0 --> 2029.38
top whereas this looks like it's more

2027.399 --> 2033.1589999999999
dark it's got like a dark thing at the

2029.38 --> 2035.23
top so you know if you held my toes to

2033.159 --> 2037.8990000000001
the fire I would say no but I do

2035.23 --> 2039.97
actually have their bolt captured so and

2037.899 --> 2041.889
it is their boat and I've got the GPS

2039.97 --> 2044.409
it's still you know it's still that

2041.889 --> 2047.83
Destin saw we saw yeah yeah yeah oh yeah

2044.409 --> 2052.03
so it has just yeah so it has to be you

2047.83 --> 2054.0099999999998
know so let's just save that so because

2052.03 --> 2056.23
when it transferred when it goes through

2054.01 --> 2058.0890000000004
these turbines here it has to be at

2056.23 --> 2061.45
least nine and a half miles away yeah

2058.089 --> 2066.369
yeah it has to be you grant me any quote

2061.45 --> 2069.22
rat ranty like how high would that boat

2066.369 --> 2071.7400000000002
be from sea level with the people in it

2069.22 --> 2073.419
that were in it oh the the the small

2071.74 --> 2075.9399999999996
boats they're only like twelve foot to

2073.419 --> 2079.0
the top I mean I might have a video so

2075.94 --> 2082.929
you're at a height of seven feet looking

2079.0 --> 2084.819
at something maximum twelve feet high at

2082.929 --> 2087.19
a distance of how many miles was it

2084.819 --> 2087.669
again well you can say at least nine

2087.19 --> 2089.2000000000003
points

2087.669 --> 2091.0299999999997
nine point six we'll take it behind

2089.2 --> 2094.1789999999996
these two turbines in the foreground

2091.03 --> 2096.369
right Roz oh that's very little

2094.179 --> 2098.5
obstruction then did you get he'll see

2096.369 --> 2101.2200000000003
it as I say it was it was a pretty

2098.5 --> 2108.809
pretty good day

2101.22 --> 2114.8689999999997
ae hello scheme are joining bears Harry

2108.809 --> 2118.4500000000003
hey Ally latarian it's going good night

2114.869 --> 2121.0
listen glad you showed up yesterday yeah

2118.45 --> 2125.49
good good so what the results I'm just

2121.0 --> 2130.18
trying to find out is the earth flat

2125.49 --> 2135.1299999999997
observations well has anyone done the

2130.18 --> 2137.23
curve cuts on that 9.6 miles from an

2135.13 --> 2139.38
elevation of seven feet above actual sea

2137.23 --> 2141.7
level

2139.38 --> 2145.299
lots of work them out right yeah

2141.7 --> 2146.6189999999997
can we see is that possible to to see

2145.299 --> 2148.96
that father that's what we have to find

2146.619 --> 2151.9300000000003
out are you gonna do the curvature

2148.96 --> 2154.21
calculation right now it's worse evil

2151.93 --> 2154.8999999999996
might as well present your screen as

2154.21 --> 2157.03
you're doing it

2154.9 --> 2161.049
oh no I conference that must be at the

2157.03 --> 2163.2000000000003
moment and but I can try to work it out

2161.049 --> 2168.45
yeah absolutely

2163.2 --> 2170.799
you got the the calculator there rent it

2168.45 --> 2172.089
no no I haven't got the calculator I'm

2170.799 --> 2173.65
actually sharing again now cuz I was

2172.089 --> 2176.0789999999997
just finding the right the correct video

2173.65 --> 2178.48
to show you guys is that they bought

2176.079 --> 2179.349
Leon that's them that's the three guys

2178.48 --> 2183.88
on the boat

2179.349 --> 2186.73
yeah that's all that they left on and it

2183.88 --> 2188.17
has a bit of blue at the top and that

2186.73 --> 2189.7
all the one did our blue at the top side

2188.17 --> 2192.28
lacks a I can't be a hundred percent

2189.7 --> 2194.6499999999996
sure but one thing this is this is give

2192.28 --> 2196.329
you a good idea of the of the height of

2194.65 --> 2198.04
the bolts in that area all these bolts

2196.329 --> 2200.65
were a roughly this in this sort of

2198.04 --> 2201.94
unite you know this is this is but you

2200.65 --> 2204.67
know let's say that these guys are six

2201.94 --> 2206.68
feet tall right and you're only seeing

2204.67 --> 2209.44
up to the knees because the rest of the

2206.68 --> 2210.64
legs are in the bolt the to the top of

2209.44 --> 2213.46
the bolt is something like twelve foot

2210.64 --> 2216.19
so this is good enough fifteen perhaps

2213.46 --> 2219.94
but yeah it's just about the bone going

2216.19 --> 2222.21
down yeah yeah yeah yeah but 15 foot max

2219.94 --> 2224.65
maximum 15 foot

2222.21 --> 2229.96
though it's pretty good reference that

2224.65 --> 2232.42
and one of those guys on that boat um is

2229.96 --> 2235.87
an engineer with credentials he has a

2232.42 --> 2238.29
degree in engineering and you know

2235.87 --> 2241.0299999999997
hopefully we can get to speak to him

2238.29 --> 2245.08
about the shape of the earth because

2241.03 --> 2247.69
he's definitely questioning it now so

2245.08 --> 2250.81
yeah he's he's on that boat and he's out

2247.69 --> 2255.88
there doing Flat Earth research knowing

2250.81 --> 2258.4
bro yeah yeah mm-hmm so yeah this is

2255.88 --> 2260.1400000000003
that this is just a typical boat of of

2258.4 --> 2262.4700000000003
all those boats that were out there so

2260.14 --> 2266.25
has anyone done the curve couch yet

2262.47 --> 2266.25
anyone done the Kirk out

2266.68 --> 2275.64
I'm on my computer and I'm on a tablet

2270.72 --> 2279.4599999999996
let me ever go let me try and find it

2275.64 --> 2281.23
out bring it up metal

2279.46 --> 2283.6
let's go to metal unless you at least

2281.23 --> 2287.77
know that that name males there at least

2283.6 --> 2291.31
we can we can see that it's if that

2287.77 --> 2294.13
boat's the size is at war we can see

2291.31 --> 2296.68
from name miles guaranteed it's flat in

2294.13 --> 2299.6800000000003
that yearly oh yeah we can say that as a

2296.68 --> 2301.87
fact we can steal eyes off five 9.6

2299.68 --> 2305.8599999999997
miles viewer fee viewer high in feet

2301.87 --> 2308.38
seven were looking at 21 feet with

2305.86 --> 2310.21
refraction hidden behind the curb so

2308.38 --> 2312.4300000000003
that would be higher than the boat that

2310.21 --> 2314.53
because the height of the boat would be

2312.43 --> 2317.77
behind the curve but yet we're seeing

2314.53 --> 2321.61
all of that boat pass behind those

2317.77 --> 2324.61
turbines so with almost zero missing in

2321.61 --> 2326.6800000000003
fact you would say in all of it hello

2324.61 --> 2329.2000000000003
Jose I hope you're not just here to

2326.68 --> 2331.2
advertise for your show because if you

2329.2 --> 2335.4399999999996
are I'm gonna kick you out right now

2331.2 --> 2337.06
hello I get to say I came to say hi

2335.44 --> 2340.42
because you went to my show a few times

2337.06 --> 2341.89
and I saw only the right team to come in

2340.42 --> 2342.79
and just chill in the background for a

2341.89 --> 2346.8399999999997
few minutes all right

2342.79 --> 2348.91
oh that's perfectly fine hello I really

2346.84 --> 2350.65
haven't watched your show today so I

2348.91 --> 2352.54
don't know what's going on I say I seem

2350.65 --> 2354.37
discord si are we are we in the Sun and

2352.54 --> 2355.12
chemo and runty so I said let me go in

2354.37 --> 2358.0
the sack

2355.12 --> 2361.0899999999997
rattle all you till fill you up on that

2358.0 --> 2365.53
Randy has been yesterday out on a field

2361.09 --> 2368.11
trip using a boat and Smurfs Kimo you

2365.53 --> 2370.9900000000002
were there too right yeah yeah I was

2368.11 --> 2374.05
there just with the observations making

2370.99 --> 2375.97
observations right in the discord but I

2374.05 --> 2378.13
don't know what went down I'm just

2375.97 --> 2380.5899999999997
explaining it to you right now so Randy

2378.13 --> 2382.87
went there where was it again the

2380.59 --> 2386.3500000000004
location nothing

2382.87 --> 2389.62
prosthetic the where was that yeah and

2386.35 --> 2391.5699999999997
he did some yeah the crew on a boat let

2389.62 --> 2395.23
it go into the distance as he filmed it

2391.57 --> 2398.17
and yeah he just we just got our first

2395.23 --> 2399.91
chemo who did it I rented it just

2398.17 --> 2401.53
calculated with the curve calculator

2399.91 --> 2404.92
that the entire boat should have been

2401.53 --> 2408.3100000000004
completely behind the curve a curve and

2404.92 --> 2411.4300000000003
visible and it wasn't because yeah we

2408.31 --> 2413.2
could see it what do you what have you

2411.43 --> 2414.3399999999997
response that is how they still here

2413.2 --> 2416.8599999999997
yeah he's here

2414.34 --> 2418.9300000000003
yeah so how's that you know how do you

2416.86 --> 2421.57
respond to that we're showing things

2418.93 --> 2424.5099999999998
that should not be seen on the board you

2421.57 --> 2427.03
hear a lot in discord and that we we

2424.51 --> 2428.38
never make observations where you

2427.03 --> 2430.69
shouldn't you know you shouldn't see

2428.38 --> 2432.85
what you say that you always should see

2430.69 --> 2434.41
it so what's your argument with this do

2432.85 --> 2438.3399999999997
you think we should see the boat do you

2434.41 --> 2444.73
have an argument for that I'm really

2438.34 --> 2447.55
short on details you know if yeah we'll

2444.73 --> 2450.22
look up whenever is presented in a in a

2447.55 --> 2451.96
solid form alike this is the what I was

2450.22 --> 2454.8999999999996
standing the height the distance of the

2451.96 --> 2456.37
boat and these conditions I'll look it

2454.9 --> 2457.9900000000002
up on I'll analyze said Boris for right

2456.37 --> 2460.72
I don't got a big opinion because I'm a

2457.99 --> 2463.06
little awesome well if you want to get

2460.72 --> 2466.0899999999997
all those details Jen just play back

2463.06 --> 2467.83
like 15 minutes into the show before you

2466.09 --> 2470.77
joined because we mentioned all these

2467.83 --> 2472.5099999999998
details and we inputted them what does

2470.77 --> 2476.41
it against seven feet observer height

2472.51 --> 2479.6200000000003
the boat was 15 feet high it max with

2476.41 --> 2483.6099999999997
everyone on it yeah over a distance of

2479.62 --> 2486.22
how many miles again at least 9.6 9.6

2483.61 --> 2488.83
would pass them past these turbines how

2486.22 --> 2491.6099999999997
far past can't be 100%

2488.83 --> 2496.63
but it has to be at least 9.6 miles

2491.61 --> 2498.61
right so yeah yeah you to be 21 feet

2496.63 --> 2500.32
should be obstructed so the entire boat

2498.61 --> 2503.29
with everyone on it should not be

2500.32 --> 2505.21
visible at all that's cool yeah yeah

2503.29 --> 2507.36
I'll look it up you know we detailing

2505.21 --> 2511.42
the big screen later I'm on my phone now

2507.36 --> 2514.48
but but it's cool too [ __ ] I lost my

2511.42 --> 2518.11
train of thought sorry it's good to do

2514.48 --> 2520.39
field work it is yeah I agree

2518.11 --> 2523.21
indeed yeah Thank You Randy for doing

2520.39 --> 2526.24
that every time being such enthusiastic

2523.21 --> 2528.19
field researchers researcher for Flat

2526.24 --> 2531.3399999999997
Earth it's very much appreciated and you

2528.19 --> 2532.92
bring back great footage so yeah thanks

2531.34 --> 2535.96
for being on my show and presenting that

2532.92 --> 2539.29
no worry but one thing I did we do want

2535.96 --> 2542.7400000000002
to talk about though is that on pretty

2539.29 --> 2545.77
much every single boat we saw squishing

2542.74 --> 2547.18
on the boat on the boats we could you

2545.77 --> 2548.86
know we could demonstrate the squishing

2547.18 --> 2551.23
and we could do that by the fact that we

2548.86 --> 2552.85
could see the wake of the boat so we can

2551.23 --> 2556.36
see the the churning up of the water

2552.85 --> 2559.33
behind the boat as the blades are going

2556.36 --> 2561.04
through the water yet the when the boat

2559.33 --> 2564.25
will be looking at the boat will seem

2561.04 --> 2567.04
part of the whole or compressed and and

2564.25 --> 2568.54
narrowed even though it's behind the

2567.04 --> 2570.58
turbines again you know so they're at

2568.54 --> 2573.07
least you know in some cases over ten

2570.58 --> 2575.2
and a half eleven miles away and all I

2573.07 --> 2577.36
was gonna say sorry dude sorry buddy

2575.2 --> 2578.89
just came to my mind that Randy at least

2577.36 --> 2581.32
you're pretty good or because you got

2578.89 --> 2583.69
some websites where you know they did

2581.32 --> 2585.13
the boat you know their position and

2583.69 --> 2586.7200000000003
where they are how far what type of

2585.13 --> 2589.06
boats they are so you can you're very

2586.72 --> 2591.2799999999997
aware down on you 100% sure then that's

2589.06 --> 2593.35
good you know that's more of details

2591.28 --> 2596.26
that you have to appreciate that yeah oh

2593.35 --> 2598.7799999999997
you mean like this yeah yeah exactly

2596.26 --> 2602.0800000000004
yeah yeah yeah because I've been

2598.78 --> 2603.8500000000004
tracking the European endeavor and I was

2602.08 --> 2608.17
also tracking a few others in the area

2603.85 --> 2610.87
also check in or else we got here too

2608.17 --> 2612.64
far in what else was there

2610.87 --> 2614.5899999999997
oh yeah so this was the route that they

2612.64 --> 2616.9
took this was the GPS route of the

2614.59 --> 2621.25
actual boat itself which was the Jensen

2616.9 --> 2622.57
so there's where it left is what went

2621.25 --> 2625.24
through the

2622.57 --> 2626.44
the wind farm and these were the

2625.24 --> 2629.64
positions that it went through and

2626.44 --> 2632.9500000000003
there's the Douglass complex behind it

2629.64 --> 2634.69
they were on and as I say the boat that

2632.95 --> 2637.6899999999996
was transferred you know sort of like

2634.69 --> 2638.92
put those onto here as well so you can

2637.69 --> 2640.06
see that this is where the boat left

2638.92 --> 2643.87
went through the wind farm and there's

2640.06 --> 2645.73
the distance where it went - that's good

2643.87 --> 2646.81
yeah appreciate just keep doing what

2645.73 --> 2649.2400000000002
you're doing keep doing the restoration

2646.81 --> 2650.62
that's it and I I poke you and I make

2649.24 --> 2652.4199999999996
fun and I draw you where you said you

2650.62 --> 2654.85
got one of some of the best globe proofs

2652.42 --> 2656.5
but that's part of the fun well you know

2654.85 --> 2660.66
we had this corner day or the YouTube

2656.5 --> 2664.65
and we gotta say that hokey shoulder I

2660.66 --> 2667.5699999999997
know Jose it's a bluff I know we know

2664.65 --> 2669.46
well I'm gonna poke you now Jose this

2667.57 --> 2672.8500000000004
boat that you seen on the screen this

2669.46 --> 2676.78
boat shouldn't be there it's looming

2672.85 --> 2681.8199999999997
yeah we got curved water there yeah and

2676.78 --> 2684.07
this is looming it's an interesting

2681.82 --> 2686.26
observation yeah I'll asked I say I mean

2684.07 --> 2688.57
I see it like just in this part you know

2686.26 --> 2690.34
is too much information I gotta just

2688.57 --> 2691.78
look it up detail and yeah

2690.34 --> 2693.7000000000003
- like am I gonna give you my

2691.78 --> 2696.13
explanation and maybe mention it with

2693.7 --> 2698.02
the guy is a the boilers that are very

2696.13 --> 2699.94
knowledgeable on math and all this stuff

2698.02 --> 2703.6
maybe I'll bring it up too much

2699.94 --> 2705.79
information Jose it's three details the

2703.6 --> 2707.98
distance the height of the boat and the

2705.79 --> 2711.7
height of the observer how is that those

2707.98 --> 2713.44
three details too much information I got

2711.7 --> 2715.1499999999996
my mind on something else I was setting

2713.44 --> 2717.34
up my own team so I just gave me all

2715.15 --> 2724.0
this fun just to say hi pretty much all

2717.34 --> 2725.53
right all right okay well anyway I'm

2724.0 --> 2729.25
like - you guys so a little bit of that

2725.53 --> 2731.65
yeah what's cool thanks yeah this one

2729.25 --> 2733.45
right here beer skittles and urine says

2731.65 --> 2735.9700000000003
runs he estimated his camera height well

2733.45 --> 2739.96
what's actually really funny about this

2735.97 --> 2742.06
entire video is that I did a live stream

2739.96 --> 2746.65
saying success it's actually called

2742.06 --> 2748.84
success and on that video is the video

2746.65 --> 2751.2400000000002
that you're just watching so I'm doing a

2748.84 --> 2754.57
live stream whilst recording on the

2751.24 --> 2756.2799999999997
p1000 and then I show you the location

2754.57 --> 2758.92
of the p1000

2756.28 --> 2761.65
how close it is to the water and I'm

2758.92 --> 2764.17
able to show that the camera is no more

2761.65 --> 2766.12
than seven foot above sea level as I'm

2764.17 --> 2769.0
actually filming it and you can hear it

2766.12 --> 2772.69
on the original p1000 footage that I've

2769.0 --> 2774.88
just showed so how could I be estimating

2772.69 --> 2778.39
my camera height my song show when I've

2774.88 --> 2780.28
got it on a separate live stream showing

2778.39 --> 2784.33
it [ __ ]

2780.28 --> 2786.01
it's no need for swearing now you know I

2784.33 --> 2788.7999999999997
mean if these guys think that I don't

2786.01 --> 2790.15
actually do the the you know don't

2788.8 --> 2792.01
actually do the measurements and stuff

2790.15 --> 2796.39
you know and it really pisses me off I

2792.01 --> 2799.15
had had a bloody tape measure with me

2796.39 --> 2801.16
you know and Spears chemo actually

2799.15 --> 2806.23
filmed me measuring the height of the

2801.16 --> 2809.71
tripods and stuff my right chemo there's

2806.23 --> 2811.9
no longer a spandrel yeah oh my what a

2809.71 --> 2814.36
lot Ronnie Ronnie I wouldn't bother with

2811.9 --> 2816.55
a with trolls and stuff like that I know

2814.36 --> 2818.56
it's good that is pushing you to you

2816.55 --> 2821.86
know do be more exact sure you read up

2818.56 --> 2824.0499999999997
but I think I think it should stop he'll

2821.86 --> 2825.9100000000003
know and you just keep continuing and

2824.05 --> 2828.61
trying ignore these idiots because they

2825.91 --> 2830.17
just you know you know you know is real

2828.61 --> 2832.8700000000003
as an when I know it's hard sometimes

2830.17 --> 2835.35
not to get travel and I bet peed off

2832.87 --> 2837.85
with these people but the pointers that

2835.35 --> 2840.0699999999997
don't feed them it's as simple as that

2837.85 --> 2841.9
you've done enough know if they asked

2840.07 --> 2843.54
for anyone eat you'll see I have can't

2841.9 --> 2846.52
be bored

2843.54 --> 2848.29
it's come back with beer and skit I just

2846.52 --> 2851.07
need to address this let me just address

2848.29 --> 2855.22
this for this little [ __ ] right

2851.07 --> 2858.1600000000003
screenshare please please display me

2855.22 --> 2861.43
when you get a chance there I win oh

2858.16 --> 2863.68
yeah yeah sorry it's just triggered by

2861.43 --> 2865.4199999999996
somebody had to prepare so this is this

2863.68 --> 2868.93
is this is the only time I'm gonna do

2865.42 --> 2870.76
this for for anybody again because I

2868.93 --> 2872.77
mean I think even the globo's know not

2870.76 --> 2874.51
to bother doing this because essentially

2872.77 --> 2880.3
I'll just rub the noses in it

2874.51 --> 2884.98
this was my location here I have the

2880.3 --> 2889.4500000000003
wind turbines mapped out on Google Earth

2884.98 --> 2892.18
in their exact spot exact spot

2889.45 --> 2893.98
and yes the nearest turbine is seven

2892.18 --> 2896.1699999999996
point nine five miles away well that

2893.98 --> 2898.2400000000002
wasn't the turbine that I was looking

2896.17 --> 2900.19
through was it because if that was the

2898.24 --> 2902.89
case I would have had a line of sight

2900.19 --> 2905.05
between that turbine and this turbine

2902.89 --> 2906.67
no the line of sight between the two

2905.05 --> 2910.0890000000004
turbines that I was looking through was

2906.67 --> 2914.53
this turbine and this turbine here which

2910.089 --> 2919.02
places the bowl right about there nine

2914.53 --> 2921.88
and a half miles away [ __ ]

2919.02 --> 2925.21
come on yeah I just need one minute to

2921.88 --> 2929.77
say ciao ciao a Libyan what stop Olli be

2925.21 --> 2932.2
you got you got I heard you were

2929.77 --> 2933.79
complaining that I say you were sketchy

2932.2 --> 2936.43
or something like that I don't want to

2933.79 --> 2938.98
bring all the [ __ ] but your your I

2936.43 --> 2940.4199999999996
see you I see you might shut sometimes

2938.98 --> 2946.57
and you're welcome to join and talk

2940.42 --> 2948.16
about if you want but there's some

2946.57 --> 2949.9300000000003
there's some good names over there that

2948.16 --> 2952.5299999999997
is is good too in Iraq with them that

2949.93 --> 2952.5299999999997
you're not

2953.56 --> 2957.369
lesson lesson lesson I've interacted

2955.569 --> 2960.4
release people for the last forty years

2957.369 --> 2963.13
forty five years almost I know who these

2960.4 --> 2965.71
people are I've been on I've been on the

2963.13 --> 2967.15
panel's forty years ago me I know

2965.71 --> 2969.4900000000002
exactly we are not coming from they

2967.15 --> 2971.319
haven't they haven't progressed I'm

2969.49 --> 2973.8999999999996
looking for people that have maybe

2971.319 --> 2976.45
accepted a few things that are blatantly

2973.9 --> 2976.81
true but they would so I don't see the

2976.45 --> 2981.0099999999998
point

2976.81 --> 2983.74
the the knock impregnation mentally

2981.01 --> 2986.1090000000004
jealousy cotton you think that when your

2983.74 --> 2989.14
thing is good no like cough wha approve

2986.109 --> 2992.38
that it's not a a Stockholm people

2989.14 --> 2995.8289999999997
retards you've got people a comb every

2992.38 --> 2998.02
every town San Joaquin look so odd I've

2995.829 --> 2999.6400000000003
asked fame or see but I've been they

2998.02 --> 3002.579
loved or not to mean us

2999.64 --> 3005.16
that's me like that's like me gonna it's

3002.579 --> 3008.88
like the debates in the first half year

3005.16 --> 3012.27
I show people said Wohlers being

3008.88 --> 3014.4300000000003
extremely offensive rattling on for 15

3012.27 --> 3017.13
minutes at homing a specific person

3014.43 --> 3021.23
laying out anything that could be looked

3017.13 --> 3021.23
down upon and then

3022.04 --> 3028.67
come on can you let me finish yeah then

3026.27 --> 3031.28
after 50 minutes of getting yelled at

3028.67 --> 3033.62
and accused of all kinds of things once

3031.28 --> 3036.05
I give a response and criticize somebody

3033.62 --> 3039.38
about their behavior and they tell me

3036.05 --> 3042.02
like how dare you be so attacking and

3039.38 --> 3043.61
offensive after being scolded for 15

3042.02 --> 3053.21
minutes without having even said

3043.61 --> 3055.2200000000003
anything so yeah that was typical it's a

3053.21 --> 3057.17
good way to show people's true colors

3055.22 --> 3059.45
from once I don't know that that's why I

3057.17 --> 3060.98
let it roll and free-for-all I try to

3059.45 --> 3064.49
interrupt the least amount possible

3060.98 --> 3066.86
because people shows themselves the way

3064.49 --> 3068.81
they Arum and then the viewers see

3066.86 --> 3070.94
what's going on and who has progressed

3068.81 --> 3073.04
still have not who have evolved and who

3070.94 --> 3075.08
have not I think that's a good thing

3073.04 --> 3076.88
I gotta run I'm gonna go head-to-head

3075.08 --> 3078.83
with Nate on my show is now by lotta

3076.88 --> 3082.2200000000003
merchandise thank you I will perhaps all

3078.83 --> 3083.2999999999997
right yeah I would I would hope to see

3082.22 --> 3088.25
you before I forget

3083.3 --> 3091.75
mm-hmm you cause pure me him you're I

3088.25 --> 3095.0
like listening to you eh

3091.75 --> 3097.55
you really do and I think it's a little

3095.0 --> 3100.25
tip you know you see about subscribers

3097.55 --> 3102.32
right you have to take a little

3100.25 --> 3104.78
something that helps you get subscribers

3102.32 --> 3107.57
is a few gone and he's definitely gone

3104.78 --> 3110.78
is many of these panels as you can in

3107.57 --> 3112.79
talk and it'll be a natural flow and you

3110.78 --> 3115.4900000000002
handle yourself really really well with

3112.79 --> 3117.35
these people you know because you know

3115.49 --> 3118.9399999999996
some of your logic just shot some down

3117.35 --> 3120.89
you know just make some look stupid

3118.94 --> 3122.48
ain't nothing be awesome your handle

3120.89 --> 3125.45
like spa's King always will

3122.48 --> 3127.46
he causes and I don't like to compare

3125.45 --> 3131.6299999999997
you with the same person but peachy on

3127.46 --> 3135.02
how God chose these bonuses can't handle

3131.63 --> 3136.61
handle people like you if you know I

3135.02 --> 3138.53
mean the and you can't have me down

3136.61 --> 3141.5
because you're your Lord you've got your

3138.53 --> 3144.0800000000004
logic sorted out and and you can give up

3141.5 --> 3146.72
flaws and nails in its I find it very

3144.08 --> 3148.8199999999997
very entertaining it's like that I think

3146.72 --> 3151.16
the last two times you should do it you

3148.82 --> 3154.34
should do it more not just him I've seen

3151.16 --> 3155.16
me but to to help you get more stops

3154.34 --> 3156.96
just

3155.16 --> 3159.33
help more subs and people maybe when he

3156.96 --> 3162.03
come on you know fellow a panel and

3159.33 --> 3164.94
stuff like nothing it's about she don't

3162.03 --> 3167.2200000000003
get more people yeah yeah I agree and

3164.94 --> 3169.83
I've I've been thinking it's been good

3167.22 --> 3173.04
training getting on there at Jose's

3169.83 --> 3176.94
being yelled at I get some it's

3173.04 --> 3179.7599999999998
basically growing some troll skin and so

3176.94 --> 3182.19
I can have a better yes because since

3179.76 --> 3185.0400000000004
Nathan basically started dominating his

3182.19 --> 3187.7400000000002
own hangout very eloquently with purpose

3185.04 --> 3190.05
yeah did there's rarely any troll

3187.74 --> 3193.2
scolding except for in chat which is

3190.05 --> 3195.9300000000003
just continual but no verbal getting

3193.2 --> 3197.5499999999997
yelled at and I've started to become

3195.93 --> 3199.23
more sensitive to it because I'm no

3197.55 --> 3202.4700000000003
longer used to that and getting on

3199.23 --> 3206.82
Jose's hangout basically give me a

3202.47 --> 3210.48
chance to grow grow some skin again and

3206.82 --> 3212.61
be able to just see yeah you already

3210.48 --> 3214.44
know that not just what you know and

3212.61 --> 3216.9900000000002
then the end of what you've got

3214.44 --> 3218.82
understand this when you yeah it put a

3216.99 --> 3221.1
little trigger than your head as soon as

3218.82 --> 3224.34
on person closure [ __ ] just laugh

3221.1 --> 3227.04
think of a funny because you just know I

3224.34 --> 3229.71
don't mean it's not about when in or you

3227.04 --> 3231.5099999999998
know there's no nefarious tactics I'm

3229.71 --> 3233.79
gunning the beam all you're doing is

3231.51 --> 3236.25
you're giving your ideals and that

3233.79 --> 3238.68
person now some reason is going

3236.25 --> 3240.69
ballistic because you have an idea and

3238.68 --> 3243.06
and that's what yeah and I'm not

3240.69 --> 3245.82
claiming Authority or science or

3243.06 --> 3251.0099999999998
anything I'm just like to keep it clear

3245.82 --> 3253.38
exactly what I do and be yeah uphold

3251.01 --> 3256.2000000000003
integrity at it and be follow my

3253.38 --> 3258.36
principles and just don't get distracted

3256.2 --> 3261.77
by their peer pressure [ __ ] all the

3258.36 --> 3264.96
time yeah and it's kind of tough because

3261.77 --> 3267.27
yeah I am a little sensitive to it but I

3264.96 --> 3269.73
just managed to focus through it and

3267.27 --> 3272.61
then everything they do it just falls

3269.73 --> 3275.31
flat on their on their face because

3272.61 --> 3278.55
they're just blessed I don't mean to be

3275.31 --> 3280.71
presumptuous but yeah that sometimes

3278.55 --> 3283.5600000000004
when you feel like not lots to do with

3280.71 --> 3286.29
self-confidence right and the cool acid

3283.56 --> 3288.72
foundation about feeling right and it's

3286.29 --> 3291.33
like it's like to build that

3288.72 --> 3293.3399999999997
confidence you know you're very decisive

3291.33 --> 3296.2799999999997
in certain ways but when you know we've

3293.34 --> 3298.17
been in dr. need to have no faith in

3296.28 --> 3299.73
ourselves question everything don't

3298.17 --> 3302.16
trust your instincts and stuff like that

3299.73 --> 3304.77
so it's kinda hard even even at my age

3302.16 --> 3307.2
attacks okay it can attack at any time

3304.77 --> 3310.41
right and she lose like oh yes thank you

3307.2 --> 3314.16
don't I don't mean in a bad way but you

3310.41 --> 3316.17
know yeah you doubt yourself you've got

3314.16 --> 3317.91
this doubt in your head and that can

3316.17 --> 3320.4300000000003
hold you back but when you're arguing

3317.91 --> 3322.2
arguing okay remember you're right they

3320.43 --> 3324.48
can't tell you what your belief is not

3322.2 --> 3326.8799999999997
generated the oiler so in the end you're

3324.48 --> 3330.51
right no matter what so don't allow that

3326.88 --> 3332.2200000000003
or trying to you know hold that diamond

3330.51 --> 3334.4100000000003
because you know we'll have it to the

3332.22 --> 3336.1499999999996
day we die that portable thing we were

3334.41 --> 3338.7599999999998
here I'll say I don't mean he ourselves

3336.15 --> 3340.53
but like things like it's really deep

3338.76 --> 3342.75
you know it's an indoctrination install

3340.53 --> 3344.55
yeah look for everyone it's different

3342.75 --> 3346.59
you know some some people especially

3344.55 --> 3349.7400000000002
when they're very young can be sensitive

3346.59 --> 3353.07
to indoctrination peer pressure and I

3349.74 --> 3357.839
have had those times but my issues

3353.07 --> 3360.21
really come from myself from my personal

3357.839 --> 3363.089
opposite before I learned to communicate

3360.21 --> 3365.01
with people out there a lot and when I

3363.089 --> 3369.18
was dealing with myself I had a lot of

3365.01 --> 3370.9500000000003
self-doubt and self-criticism and so it

3369.18 --> 3373.44
basically comes from me it's not really

3370.95 --> 3376.14
indoctrinated from the outside it was a

3373.44 --> 3377.7000000000003
little abuse reinforced from the outside

3376.14 --> 3383.49
as I was younger because people would

3377.7 --> 3388.02
gladly use my good nature all that but

3383.49 --> 3389.49
these days not so much it's just yeah if

3388.02 --> 3392.79
there's natural tendency to be very

3389.49 --> 3395.64
critical about of myself and pride at

3392.79 --> 3399.15
the same time to actually want to be a

3395.64 --> 3402.5989999999997
fantastic mighty person but I have to be

3399.15 --> 3404.88
realistic about it and yeah and

3402.599 --> 3407.9700000000003
basically just let that honor get

3404.88 --> 3410.609
trampled by realizing yeah you know

3407.97 --> 3413.58
these ballers are nasty bastards some of

3410.609 --> 3416.5499999999997
them that are yeah get keep attacking

3413.58 --> 3418.7999999999997
you psychologically try to make it as

3416.55 --> 3420.57
bad as possible but I have to be

3418.8 --> 3422.1000000000004
realistic that even though they are

3420.57 --> 3425.5800000000004
bastards

3422.1 --> 3428.1
I do have certain flaws and issues and

3425.58 --> 3432.24
doubts that they are actually addressing

3428.1 --> 3435.6
but that I shouldn't put any value to

3432.24 --> 3436.95
really on the long run but those

3435.6 --> 3440.7599999999998
thoughts are there

3436.95 --> 3442.74
I do feel almost exorcised from society

3440.76 --> 3446.01
sometimes because I didn't get all the

3442.74 --> 3448.5
papers because I didn't manage to find

3446.01 --> 3451.0800000000004
my way into some kind of corporation or

3448.5 --> 3454.02
whatever and become an integrated part

3451.08 --> 3457.62
of society in a normal way in the normal

3454.02 --> 3462.42
way and that exists that is there I have

3457.62 --> 3464.66
to recognize that and then move on so

3462.42 --> 3467.1
while the ballers keep on being all

3464.66 --> 3468.8399999999997
anxious about that and trying to

3467.1 --> 3470.73
emphasize that because they couldn't

3468.84 --> 3473.1000000000004
handle something like they couldn't

3470.73 --> 3474.9900000000002
handle being me I just have to move

3473.1 --> 3478.47
beyond while they keep stuck on that

3474.99 --> 3480.99
nonsense and I just enter the real

3478.47 --> 3482.73
subject again that they're trying to

3480.99 --> 3484.9199999999996
evade with all their peer pressure

3482.73 --> 3486.72
[ __ ] because that's what they're

3484.92 --> 3488.79
really doing they're all I ever do is

3486.72 --> 3492.24
Bluff and evade and red-herring

3488.79 --> 3495.36
everything because yeah that's what they

3492.24 --> 3498.3599999999997
invested in they put all their

3495.36 --> 3500.01
investments in the bluff in the the

3498.36 --> 3502.29
image of having all this knowledge

3500.01 --> 3504.1800000000003
available and therefore the answers

3502.29 --> 3506.94
while when you actually test all their

3504.18 --> 3510.56
knowledge they don't and that's kind of

3506.94 --> 3513.2400000000002
the game profession it's pure

3510.56 --> 3515.91
superficial live they've only lay out

3513.24 --> 3517.8599999999997
what we've taught them because real

3515.91 --> 3519.69
actually there they are permanently

3517.86 --> 3522.48
playing card shop they're coming up.we

3519.69 --> 3524.61
excuses after the excuses I'm gonna I'm

3522.48 --> 3526.71
gonna love to hear how they respond to

3524.61 --> 3528.96
run his orbs of issues but as I was

3526.71 --> 3531.12
Tracy if the gala but there are there

3528.96 --> 3533.9700000000003
red herring it that that's what they do

3531.12 --> 3535.7999999999997
use after even science when you look at

3533.97 --> 3538.3799999999997
science and you ask see all these

3535.8 --> 3541.11
questions we are asking right like these

3538.38 --> 3543.06
are questions that when they when they

3541.11 --> 3544.65
first decided what items well and stuff

3543.06 --> 3547.17
these have been discussed from us

3544.65 --> 3550.83
awfully late so it's been decided that

3547.17 --> 3553.11
this is I am you know what particles are

3550.83 --> 3555.2999999999997
what happens what a vacuum what the void

3553.11 --> 3557.1600000000003
is what you know they've got an answer

3555.3 --> 3558.84
sort of asked every question so they've

3557.16 --> 3561.87
always got an answer for it right

3558.84 --> 3564.03
always on the deepest level because the

3561.87 --> 3567.66
sampling did discuss pay puts the best

3564.03 --> 3569.6400000000003
we in the philosophy used arguments so

3567.66 --> 3572.2799999999997
it's basically you're arguing against an

3569.64 --> 3574.3199999999997
argument that that a hundred thousand

3572.28 --> 3577.44
people have already discussed every

3574.32 --> 3579.0
floor and there I formed an argument

3577.44 --> 3581.4900000000002
overnight and we've got no chance

3579.0 --> 3583.68
well what we do we do but what we're

3581.49 --> 3587.4199999999996
fighting against sorry sorry but what

3583.68 --> 3590.49
we're fighting against mostly is that

3587.42 --> 3594.54
people psychologically have a response

3590.49 --> 3597.2099999999996
to tend to go with somebody that has

3594.54 --> 3599.7599999999998
some answers about something yeah

3597.21 --> 3602.01
instead of a person that is just being

3599.76 --> 3605.4
blatantly honest saying no I don't

3602.01 --> 3609.36
understand it and I think they made it

3605.4 --> 3611.28
up yes a person will not go with that

3609.36 --> 3614.9100000000003
because it is nothing they'd rather go

3611.28 --> 3618.2400000000002
with a story to fill in that that

3614.91 --> 3621.18
purpose that area then to trust somebody

3618.24 --> 3623.87
on their judgement that like yeah no

3621.18 --> 3627.21
they're bluffing and we don't know

3623.87 --> 3629.37
that's the problem just like the others

3627.21 --> 3631.86
constantly complaining where's your

3629.37 --> 3634.17
model where's your model because that's

3631.86 --> 3636.63
so important to them to have that all

3634.17 --> 3639.84
filled in it's that psychological need

3636.63 --> 3642.4500000000003
to have all the answers there yeah and

3639.84 --> 3645.33
that's the thing right now this is what

3642.45 --> 3648.06
gets me late June or does the science

3645.33 --> 3650.46
uses in from the beginning of time man

3648.06 --> 3653.37
has wondered where it all began where

3650.46 --> 3655.98
excuse me that's painful for them but as

3653.37 --> 3657.5699999999997
a real of an adult kill how it all began

3655.98 --> 3661.35
and stuff like that well those beggars

3657.57 --> 3662.5800000000004
but huge massive social issues the one

3661.35 --> 3665.19
who does good in a certain direction

3662.58 --> 3667.98
that's not it's not been it's not going

3665.19 --> 3669.63
to be a very nice a world North Allah a

3667.98 --> 3672.48
not for not for me because I'll probably

3669.63 --> 3675.1800000000003
be or dates but I'm gonna see I'm seeing

3672.48 --> 3678.57
it no man I will I will see and you know

3675.18 --> 3683.33
in ten years time the one who be are a

3678.57 --> 3685.92
lot different because of these ideals of

3683.33 --> 3689.49
getting pushed to

3685.92 --> 3691.6800000000003
yeah but that's that's correct but at

3689.49 --> 3693.87
the same time do not underestimate the

3691.68 --> 3697.5899999999997
awakening and how it migrates how it

3693.87 --> 3701.49
touch upon is upon new people that have

3697.59 --> 3703.76
been dormant ly asleep not really

3701.49 --> 3707.3399999999997
getting involved eventually these people

3703.76 --> 3710.1600000000003
over time will suddenly be ready step

3707.34 --> 3713.28
forward out of curiosity take a look and

3710.16 --> 3716.8199999999997
then give a whole new meaning whole new

3713.28 --> 3719.61
perspective whole new fresh ideas to the

3716.82 --> 3722.9700000000003
whole thing reinterpret it from another

3719.61 --> 3724.94
fresh perspective and the awakening does

3722.97 --> 3728.79
continue

3724.94 --> 3731.04
yeah I'm optimistic though so in one

3728.79 --> 3733.5299999999997
hand there's the nasty corporatism

3731.04 --> 3734.99
that's going full mind-control getting

3733.53 --> 3738.1800000000003
worse getting more blatantly

3734.99 --> 3742.7999999999997
indoctrinating and evil becoming so bad

3738.18 --> 3745.47
that people just can't think clearly

3742.8 --> 3748.59
anymore and even start to fall for very

3745.47 --> 3749.8799999999997
obvious lies because it's so pressuring

3748.59 --> 3752.61
everything the whole thing has become

3749.88 --> 3755.33
big pressure but at the same time yeah

3752.61 --> 3757.98
there's more people awakening and

3755.33 --> 3760.47
building defenses against that every

3757.98 --> 3763.05
time so it just continues on and where

3760.47 --> 3765.0899999999997
it's going to end up well it's not going

3763.05 --> 3768.0600000000004
to end up with everyone indoctrinated at

3765.09 --> 3769.71
all it's like that I don't think they'll

3768.06 --> 3773.15
ever be able to endure it they'll always

3769.71 --> 3777.03
be people like also people always a

3773.15 --> 3780.36
equation or more like not just always

3777.03 --> 3784.94
people like us but many more like us and

3780.36 --> 3788.3700000000003
we'll be like the oldies eventually

3784.94 --> 3790.8
they'll see us as veterans and we will

3788.37 --> 3794.5499999999997
be kind of outdated probably to them

3790.8 --> 3796.65
because they're younger they've grown up

3794.55 --> 3798.6000000000004
more used to certain elements that

3796.65 --> 3800.4900000000002
people from our generations have a

3798.6 --> 3803.25
little bit more trouble integrating with

3800.49 --> 3807.0
how the world has changed and they will

3803.25 --> 3809.31
top us probably yet we we know with the

3807.0 --> 3811.32
thing is at my age I went way off

3809.31 --> 3813.5099999999998
I've lived let me stand how many decades

3811.32 --> 3815.25
honestly that I can remember would be

3813.51 --> 3817.7000000000003
the seventies because I was born in this

3815.25 --> 3821.0
exeed so I can remember the 70

3817.7 --> 3822.9199999999996
these ladies into thousands I've seen

3821.0 --> 3825.559
said I've seen a change it's like a

3822.92 --> 3827.96
phone to me and and like a lot of other

3825.559 --> 3830.75
people have is where I'm not special but

3827.96 --> 3832.25
a thermic but but it that doesn't give

3830.75 --> 3834.049
me the right to think in one way

3832.25 --> 3835.64
everything which I don't you know I was

3834.049 --> 3838.369
lesson doesn't man I don't look at his

3835.64 --> 3841.16
age I mean you always have to write to

3838.369 --> 3842.9
to think you know everything but he

3841.16 --> 3844.3689999999997
would always be wrong because everyone

3842.9 --> 3847.4900000000002
that thinks that is always wrong

3844.369 --> 3849.65
yeah but my only to say you know it's

3847.49 --> 3851.4799999999996
about convections you know love is about

3849.65 --> 3853.609
a sick of confidence if you've got it

3851.48 --> 3855.71
believe in your convictions but you have

3853.609 --> 3857.119
to remain but the little add on this you

3855.71 --> 3860.119
have to remember you could be totally

3857.119 --> 3863.119
wrong I have someone if someone comes

3860.119 --> 3865.339
along improves your your your theory

3863.119 --> 3867.4700000000003
wrong or whatever you have to be Minot

3865.339 --> 3869.569
y'all didn't man up and accept and take

3867.47 --> 3872.3289999999997
that on board right and drop it nothing

3869.569 --> 3874.67
I'm won't stay up as open-minded as you

3872.329 --> 3878.3590000000004
can and also realize when you can't

3874.67 --> 3880.16
really handle it that's all so yeah it's

3878.359 --> 3882.589
never been as honest as you can are when

3880.16 --> 3885.319
an asset truth right it's a principle so

3882.589 --> 3889.43
he'd been human no matter how old you

3885.319 --> 3892.24
get how hard it becomes to adapt to the

3889.43 --> 3895.2799999999997
front line of how the world has become

3892.24 --> 3897.2599999999998
you can always follow the principles

3895.28 --> 3900.6800000000003
that have guided you in the first place

3897.26 --> 3904.3390000000004
to get there and those principles may

3900.68 --> 3907.8799999999997
even give a whole new angle eventually

3904.339 --> 3911.21
principles from older age have unique

3907.88 --> 3914.5
tendency to create order in the much

3911.21 --> 3917.63
more fluid chaos of the front line young

3914.5 --> 3920.839
creative thinkers so there's a special

3917.63 --> 3923.0
role an elder role there yeah like if

3920.839 --> 3927.74
you followed if you're a principled

3923.0 --> 3929.569
person and don't on the run throw all

3927.74 --> 3931.79
those principles a way to accomplish

3929.569 --> 3934.339
some short-term goal because if you keep

3931.79 --> 3935.96
them doing that yeah you're not gonna

3934.339 --> 3939.5
have these principles you're not gonna

3935.96 --> 3943.819
have the energy not different the trust

3939.5 --> 3945.95
anyway but yeah I think yeah Ally you're

3943.819 --> 3949.3089999999997
definitely one of the more principled

3945.95 --> 3951.54
people that I've met in flatter it so

3949.309 --> 3953.25
far there's a lot of them

3951.54 --> 3956.34
but everybody has their own types of

3953.25 --> 3959.37
principles and and flexibilities that

3956.34 --> 3963.21
they choose so it's different for

3959.37 --> 3964.65
everyone but I so I can still I can

3963.21 --> 3967.65
still be on deck head and stuff like

3964.65 --> 3970.05
that you know it's like horses but that

3967.65 --> 3973.4100000000003
that's not what more other principles

3970.05 --> 3975.78
that's that's just being a human yeah

3973.41 --> 3978.81
yeah yeah but sometimes we can we can

3975.78 --> 3980.82
not hold true today you know what no I

3978.81 --> 3982.83
don't mean no you know sometimes we make

3980.82 --> 3984.78
mistakes and we have to punish

3982.83 --> 3986.97
I mean punish ourselves but the next day

3984.78 --> 3990.69
move on recognize you've made the

3986.97 --> 3993.27
mistake would not necessarily punish

3990.69 --> 3996.18
just correct it and try to make it right

3993.27 --> 3997.23
but you should get angry yourself I

3996.18 --> 3999.87
think I think you should get angry

3997.23 --> 4001.4
yourself but just for that D way or you

3999.87 --> 4002.93
know what see right okay I wouldn't do

4001.4 --> 4004.88
that again that's what a decade you

4002.93 --> 4007.1
hopped it cuz that's like you have takes

4004.88 --> 4009.26
it Tina otherwise you just kept me on

4007.1 --> 4010.88
sale on you have to mentally see yeah

4009.26 --> 4012.8
I've been a decade that was stupid

4010.88 --> 4015.05
but don't punish yourself because it's

4012.8 --> 4017.27
always the punishment this that's you

4015.05 --> 4019.4300000000003
know like you don't know think about it

4017.27 --> 4021.92
for weeks and weeks and stuff like that

4019.43 --> 4024.0499999999997
and that's that's it's a hard habit or

4021.92 --> 4026.27
if you've broke up we are dead or friend

4024.05 --> 4028.6400000000003
you know don't drag out from yourself

4026.27 --> 4031.31
I've still got frames let's go talk

4028.64 --> 4033.1099999999997
about that get all friends that that

4031.31 --> 4035.0
they had like 10 years ago it's my fault

4033.11 --> 4038.6
and I choose my move on you like me I

4035.0 --> 4041.09
mean I don't talk about half here do you

4038.6 --> 4042.95
do that but but a but listen but it's so

4041.09 --> 4045.38
hard to do our and this is that I mean

4042.95 --> 4047.4199999999996
you have been through that air that not

4045.38 --> 4049.2200000000003
for Neil's but for months and after the

4047.42 --> 4051.35
months after were left hell am i doing

4049.22 --> 4053.66
it again unless unless he's not helping

4051.35 --> 4055.91
me I have to drop lesson you know when

4053.66 --> 4057.68
some mad at are it's practice meet

4055.91 --> 4059.48
before you can't just switch off it's

4057.68 --> 4061.7
not easy to forget someone that you are

4059.48 --> 4065.12
totally loved way or whatever it's not

4061.7 --> 4068.0899999999997
easy but the point is it's like are it

4065.12 --> 4070.3399999999997
takes about a team you've got here the

4068.09 --> 4072.17
thing is you have to say ankles in your

4070.34 --> 4073.61
brain and remain yourself when you see

4072.17 --> 4076.16
this is stupid that I shouldn't be

4073.61 --> 4078.83
thinking about this and just so crying

4076.16 --> 4080.8399999999997
so yeah don't go obsessing over negative

4078.83 --> 4083.0299999999997
things especially if you blame yourself

4080.84 --> 4085.11
for it yeah that's a good one I don't do

4083.03 --> 4087.36
that anymore

4085.11 --> 4088.77
sometimes I get caught up in in in one

4087.36 --> 4091.2000000000003
of these spirals when I just feel

4088.77 --> 4093.3
overall bad and yeah that can't happen

4091.2 --> 4095.46
although my healer really helps against

4093.3 --> 4102.33
that a lot what he does that works

4095.46 --> 4103.89
really great but yeah that's uncommon

4102.33 --> 4106.71
but just remember see when you go down

4103.89 --> 4108.18
there he spirals not remember you've cut

4106.71 --> 4110.1
you've had them before and you've come

4108.18 --> 4113.01
out they are not saying right so don't

4110.1 --> 4116.85
get really big thing you know is wield a

4113.01 --> 4118.62
very good plain domain J as she told me

4116.85 --> 4120.780000000001
that's changed because I've heard the

4118.62 --> 4123.75
patient before or feeling their you know

4120.78 --> 4125.639999999999
it's a not manic-depression mother

4123.75 --> 4129.0
friend event but I've heard oppression

4125.64 --> 4130.47
before and but she she said that they

4129.0 --> 4132.33
are great suddenly just change

4130.47 --> 4134.52
manipulation she says don't get

4132.33 --> 4136.859
depressed about in the place you've been

4134.52 --> 4138.780000000001
the place before you've come out on the

4136.859 --> 4140.01
other end of the tunnel right it doesn't

4138.78 --> 4142.0199999999995
mean that you're certain you're good all

4140.01 --> 4145.650000000001
those like at the end they come no it

4142.02 --> 4148.319
means dude it was almost as if his I

4145.65 --> 4149.58
said revel and not decoration you

4148.319 --> 4151.68
haven't because you know that you're

4149.58 --> 4154.41
gonna miss when you're depressed if

4151.68 --> 4155.91
you're really clever or smart you can

4154.41 --> 4159.8099999999995
solve problems

4155.91 --> 4161.88
now you can it's real twenty when you

4159.81 --> 4163.9800000000005
try and train your mind you can actually

4161.88 --> 4166.2300000000005
solve problems knowing there are maybe

4163.98 --> 4167.759999999999
tomorrow or the next day I'm gonna be

4166.23 --> 4170.759999999999
okay right let's see what I can achieve

4167.76 --> 4171.99
but on the place like the things you

4170.76 --> 4173.91
know what I mean it's real good yeah I

4171.99 --> 4175.469999999999
know exactly what you mean and then I

4173.91 --> 4178.099999999999
actually have learned to do that

4175.47 --> 4181.2
although it's kind of risky I call it

4178.1 --> 4184.410000000001
looking into the dark it's something

4181.2 --> 4188.51
that works when I'm in ice and it gives

4184.41 --> 4191.28
me this unique ability to oversee

4188.51 --> 4194.04
evil people and how they think and how

4191.28 --> 4198.99
they do that's like kind of like the

4194.04 --> 4203.1
only four to me measurable useful skill

4198.99 --> 4205.5
I got out of that state other than that

4203.1 --> 4207.6
stare other than that it's just sitting

4205.5 --> 4209.7
through it and just knowing that no

4207.6 --> 4211.89
matter how I feel or think about it

4209.7 --> 4214.26
I know it's cyclical and it will end

4211.89 --> 4216.81
just have to sit through it and not

4214.26 --> 4218.91
waste as much energy on it it's it's

4216.81 --> 4221.7300000000005
kind of to me practically like

4218.91 --> 4225.12
okay this is the low-energy standby mode

4221.73 --> 4228.919999999999
and again when our is that your thoughts

4225.12 --> 4230.849999999999
are gonna be short-sighted about it

4228.92 --> 4235.41
naturally that's the problem

4230.85 --> 4237.660000000001
yes so it's all a matter of not getting

4235.41 --> 4239.76
tricked by your own subconscious into

4237.66 --> 4241.97
wasting all of your energy on useless

4239.76 --> 4245.12
things and just sitting through it

4241.97 --> 4248.820000000001
trying not to throw away all that energy

4245.12 --> 4250.5599999999995
that that's how I say and it can be very

4248.82 --> 4254.4
difficult because yeah when you're in

4250.56 --> 4256.59
such a state your mind can make you do

4254.4 --> 4259.23
ridiculous things and get obsessed with

4256.59 --> 4261.03
really ridiculous things and then

4259.23 --> 4263.549999999999
afterward you always feel very stupid

4261.03 --> 4265.98
when people tell to tell you about it

4263.55 --> 4270.570000000001
what you actually did when you're better

4265.98 --> 4272.669999999999
so it's silly how that works but yeah

4270.57 --> 4274.74
well and the stories learn little tricks

4272.67 --> 4277.62
right as you can actually if you're

4274.74 --> 4279.54
really really really concentrate you can

4277.62 --> 4283.23
learn this trick is you can actually

4279.54 --> 4284.67
feel that emotion coming on right you

4283.23 --> 4285.929999999999
can actually I don't mean the depression

4284.67 --> 4288.4800000000005
thing I mean when you do stupid things

4285.93 --> 4291.12
you obsess the boma

4288.48 --> 4293.79
wait you can actually recognize it's

4291.12 --> 4296.07
like a physiology their physiological a

4293.79 --> 4298.56
feeling it's like chemicals start moving

4296.07 --> 4300.63
and if you get any sense your body you

4298.56 --> 4303.150000000001
can feel now right yeah you feel energy

4300.63 --> 4304.95
displacement yeah exactly they feel that

4303.15 --> 4307.049999999999
and feel it's very solid

4304.95 --> 4309.42
like in the moment I can even realize

4307.05 --> 4311.67
I'm making a mistake without actually

4309.42 --> 4314.61
knowing yet what that mistake is I just

4311.67 --> 4317.55
feel like oh well that's so weird oh

4314.61 --> 4319.65
that works right but that's one scene so

4317.55 --> 4322.38
therefore know what you have to do at

4319.65 --> 4324.24
that point it's new when that happens

4322.38 --> 4327.6900000000005
you've got a limb here that actually

4324.24 --> 4331.32
it's almost like owns any or piously see

4327.69 --> 4333.089999999999
it's like an anchor kinda are a tradeoff

4331.32 --> 4334.7699999999995
motion right so what you're doing is

4333.09 --> 4336.45
you're not alone because your brains

4334.77 --> 4338.9400000000005
part unless is wrong you can feel this

4336.45 --> 4340.95
happening or whatever on the you've and

4338.94 --> 4342.33
that specific lena thought because maybe

4340.95 --> 4343.8
your anna-lena thought towards

4342.33 --> 4345.99
something's gonna happen rate you're

4343.8 --> 4348.12
pre-empting something something that's

4345.99 --> 4349.62
not happening it happened yet

4348.12 --> 4351.96
your pre-empting it and you're getting

4349.62 --> 4352.59
an iranian st or maybe anxiety or

4351.96 --> 4355.83
pleasure

4352.59 --> 4358.619000000001
whichever one your p.m. to Nevada hasn't

4355.83 --> 4360.389
harmed yet powerful when you wait some

4358.619 --> 4363.089999999999
say it's like I don't look like a flag

4360.389 --> 4365.34
it's like the subconscious flags it's

4363.09 --> 4367.56
because it knows exactly what the

4365.34 --> 4369.4800000000005
mistake is even though your conscious is

4367.56 --> 4372.81
too distracted by other things to

4369.48 --> 4374.879999999999
realize it yeah but seeing you can say

4372.81 --> 4376.830000000001
you can say that flag trillion is a

4374.88 --> 4379.9490000000005
trigger so what happens as soon as I

4376.83 --> 4381.63
trigger booze that feeling goes away now

4379.949 --> 4384.15
you ever but you but but you've got to

4381.63 --> 4385.8
find in the police that you're gonna

4384.15 --> 4387.96
improve yourself you can laugh you know

4385.8 --> 4391.9800000000005
make a joke you can even put a picture

4387.96 --> 4393.75
of if you find a ball they are funny and

4391.98 --> 4395.909
and you can do this with any such

4393.75 --> 4397.349
reasons but not to do a fly off you can

4395.909 --> 4400.04
actually teach yourself when this is

4397.349 --> 4402.389
when less feeling is big the common

4400.04 --> 4403.83
overcoming it doesn't matter whether you

4402.389 --> 4405.21
know what's gonna belong you know

4403.83 --> 4406.7699999999995
there's something gonna go wrong and

4405.21 --> 4408.9
let's train of thought that your own is

4406.77 --> 4411.38
not a good idea so you need to second

4408.9 --> 4413.73
any make up a chalice like things right

4411.38 --> 4417.54
understand what you mean it's like

4413.73 --> 4420.629999999999
creating a separate image to basically

4417.54 --> 4423.15
console and comfort you a different when

4420.63 --> 4426.1990000000005
your own imagination would naturally

4423.15 --> 4429.449
start to look into dreaded the onset

4426.199 --> 4433.86
exactly it seems your nature to comfort

4429.449 --> 4436.44
you like a toy yeah honestly are when

4433.86 --> 4439.139
the swatches noodle linguistic program

4436.44 --> 4443.009999999999
and this is I mean it's a sense the LEP

4439.139 --> 4445.1990000000005
bias in moment when you are really hurt

4443.01 --> 4448.679
by something that can be yourself or

4445.199 --> 4451.08
making a mistake or just being really

4448.679 --> 4452.1900000000005
badly you mean it humiliated in a way

4451.08 --> 4454.08
you didn't see coming

4452.19 --> 4455.879999999999
then that technique what you just

4454.08 --> 4458.67
described works really well and I've

4455.88 --> 4459.2390000000005
been through that and I've had that

4458.67 --> 4463.29
ability

4459.239 --> 4465.36
naturally it's like when I was really

4463.29 --> 4468.0
young these kind of things would happen

4465.36 --> 4468.9
I would be very hurt by things even

4468.0 --> 4471.9
though other people wouldn't even

4468.9 --> 4475.08
realize it and then I would shoot into

4471.9 --> 4478.138999999999
my imagination very quickly to basically

4475.08 --> 4481.0199999999995
comfort me as happened many times it's

4478.139 --> 4482.82
probably partly what spawned my dark

4481.02 --> 4484.7300000000005
world experiences that natural tendency

4482.82 --> 4486.74
to respond

4484.73 --> 4491.29
agony with fleeing in my imagination

4486.74 --> 4495.11
it's a form of pathological escapism

4491.29 --> 4498.38
that came naturally to my to how I

4495.11 --> 4501.98
function and see what happens right is

4498.38 --> 4504.86
what arms after do not it for a certain

4501.98 --> 4507.169999999999
link the thing when people or it coming

4504.86 --> 4509.78
train familiar you were you don't have

4507.17 --> 4511.58
to go away in that dark space because

4509.78 --> 4513.23
this is become a habit and less is no

4511.58 --> 4515.66
implanted in your subconscious no you

4513.23 --> 4518.78
can face these people because that

4515.66 --> 4521.24
feeling is gone but your that not a

4518.78 --> 4522.74
place it appear that you actually put

4521.24 --> 4525.29
yourself and you change your physiology

4522.74 --> 4527.54
no you're standing in front of a person

4525.29 --> 4530.03
is just losing it and you're late you've

4527.54 --> 4532.37
toned in here as if you're looking at a

4530.03 --> 4536.05
monkey in a zoo but your allies this is

4532.37 --> 4539.51
amazing analyze and though your sadness

4536.05 --> 4541.1900000000005
the language there and your lakyn

4539.51 --> 4542.780000000001
another what your separate from that

4541.19 --> 4544.3099999999995
person it's almost like our

4542.78 --> 4546.98
enlightenment you know like brothers

4544.31 --> 4549.38
wait you're totally latent we you you

4546.98 --> 4550.79
have no emotions regarding you know when

4549.38 --> 4552.95
you just sweat you off and suddenly the

4550.79 --> 4555.26
Eagles gone you'll just studying the

4552.95 --> 4557.15
Pilsen you're stable again and you're

4555.26 --> 4558.76
not gonna take it very seriously you're

4557.15 --> 4561.469999999999
gonna see them

4558.76 --> 4564.110000000001
ranting and raving indeed almost like

4561.47 --> 4566.72
watching at a and an ape getting all

4564.11 --> 4569.45
frustrated in disease it's it almost

4566.72 --> 4572.0
sounds like this flippin until early in

4569.45 --> 4574.79
some way but it is indeed kind of like

4572.0 --> 4576.86
the experience once you set yourself and

4574.79 --> 4579.95
you stabilize yourself in response to

4576.86 --> 4584.8099999999995
something bad then they just ramble on

4579.95 --> 4589.13
and start ranting and raving almost like

4584.81 --> 4591.26
children actually I'm so Carter yeah but

4589.13 --> 4593.27
imagine imagine the picture I get is

4591.26 --> 4595.25
when when these people start on y'all

4593.27 --> 4597.620000000001
but right I really I'm gonna try us a

4595.25 --> 4598.13
really good picture you get is like a

4597.62 --> 4600.8
gorilla

4598.13 --> 4604.1900000000005
against the one hand against the bar

4600.8 --> 4606.820000000001
leakage flinging bananas at your so you

4604.19 --> 4609.0199999999995
know I mean something really cooks so

4606.82 --> 4610.67
that would be the anchor that's what

4609.02 --> 4613.070000000001
there's a good example that's what we'd

4610.67 --> 4615.14
be an anchor rate and you know after

4613.07 --> 4616.849999999999
doing a couple of times it becomes party

4615.14 --> 4618.92
are when you know he can build habits

4616.85 --> 4620.75
very very easy

4618.92 --> 4623.03
you know it takes a while and it depends

4620.75 --> 4624.89
how good you are you know recognizing

4623.03 --> 4625.7
when your physiology is changing you're

4624.89 --> 4627.4400000000005
gonna make a mistake

4625.7 --> 4630.08
your subconscious moves and at what it's

4627.44 --> 4632.33
doing and once you eventually it's yeah

4630.08 --> 4634.55
as more physiological reaction it's just

4632.33 --> 4637.01
your subconscious as now you have a new

4634.55 --> 4639.4400000000005
view your your law at logic or your

4637.01 --> 4641.0
warrant viewer or the way that you your

4639.44 --> 4644.15
your main talent you've changed that

4641.0 --> 4646.52
totally and that's him if malleable than

4644.15 --> 4648.95
breena's it's sooo easy it change but

4646.52 --> 4651.290000000001
you know as practice makes perfect you

4648.95 --> 4652.94
know it's not late autumn or I'm gonna

4651.29 --> 4654.8
do it and then five minutes later you've

4652.94 --> 4658.16
done it no you're right the brain is

4654.8 --> 4661.01
malleable but also very sensitive

4658.16 --> 4663.38
especially when you do it you can't you

4661.01 --> 4666.530000000001
can't use it just like a machine you

4663.38 --> 4669.28
have to very yeah delicately deal with

4666.53 --> 4673.19
these processes and make careful choices

4669.28 --> 4675.679999999999
it can't just rough it around yeah I was

4673.19 --> 4677.419999999999
about a yeah Sam you know but I was just

4675.68 --> 4680.240000000001
getting an overall picture that people

4677.42 --> 4682.7
really wanted leonov aitikaf dig when is

4680.24 --> 4684.53
studying you know psychology new

4682.7 --> 4688.25
linguistic truth but I was just like an

4684.53 --> 4690.7
overall blanket thing to Liam you have

4688.25 --> 4693.5
to have a feel for it as it happens

4690.7 --> 4694.73
recognize the pulses the impulses where

4693.5 --> 4697.88
they come from are they coming from

4694.73 --> 4700.58
yourself from your feelings or from

4697.88 --> 4703.28
something in the air and just learn to

4700.58 --> 4705.35
recognize the impulses almost like

4703.28 --> 4707.44
reading the energy and then eventually

4705.35 --> 4709.76
they will be able to figure out

4707.44 --> 4713.419999999999
psychologically what causes them and how

4709.76 --> 4716.06
that dynamic works that's how I figured

4713.42 --> 4718.31
it out all of it yeah that's exactly

4716.06 --> 4721.160000000001
that's exactly exactly how you do it and

4718.31 --> 4723.92
just eventually you know it becomes

4721.16 --> 4725.45
habitual that that you know your

4723.92 --> 4727.37
physiology doesn't change you know you

4725.45 --> 4729.0199999999995
don't get a chemicals ramming them that

4727.37 --> 4731.96
you feel we need to start shouting

4729.02 --> 4733.97
screaming but the ego bust and forth and

4731.96 --> 4737.15
stuff around because even planted these

4733.97 --> 4739.9400000000005
local struggles you know local gateways

4737.15 --> 4742.58
like the guy in the the guy with the

4739.94 --> 4744.589999999999
real on the rail we change in there's a

4742.58 --> 4746.12
train going and he's going to change a

4744.59 --> 4748.49
track and that's all as is basically

4746.12 --> 4750.86
you're changing the track and you're

4748.49 --> 4752.84
going down that track that back snowgo

4750.86 --> 4755.24
obsolete the one that used to get you

4752.84 --> 4757.64
physiology is based on automatic yes

4755.24 --> 4759.17
means like that a little controller did

4757.64 --> 4760.97
any and there does automatic you don't

4759.17 --> 4764.39
even need think about you know right if

4760.97 --> 4770.150000000001
you find a better path a better route to

4764.39 --> 4772.490000000001
walk with your like your yeah true alley

4770.15 --> 4774.889999999999
