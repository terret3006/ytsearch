it's really beautiful

132.48 --> 139.76
and yeah sun is shining very bright

136.26 --> 139.76
there's still a lot of wind though

140.819 --> 145.85999999999999
and yeah the wind can be a bit cold but

143.459 --> 148.5
yeah with the Sun

145.86 --> 150.48000000000002
like if you're if you can catch a spot

148.5 --> 152.58
outside of the wind it's it's really

150.48 --> 155.22
nice

152.58 --> 157.62
if you really give you a springtime

155.22 --> 160.76
feeling like it's coming

157.62 --> 160.76
and it is of course

170.76 --> 173.76
you

174.18 --> 178.92000000000002
hello America sale for Patriot first in

176.819 --> 181.14
chat Jeff gashead stop and trafficking

178.92 --> 184.099
arrest a hat Stone monkey Adam Price

181.14 --> 184.099
good to see you

187.019 --> 189.92000000000002
ah

190.819 --> 194.54
hello Kevlar

200.819 --> 207.06
all right

202.5 --> 211.159
so yeah I'm uh I'm a bit wobbly today

207.06 --> 211.159
that really rough day overall yesterday

212.159 --> 216.12
what it was

214.56 --> 221.12
it's like

216.12 --> 221.12
it's just my some of my organs were just

221.28 --> 226.739
power or something like

224.34 --> 229.08
did not really have a pleasant time

226.739 --> 232.31900000000002
overall yesterday even though I had I

229.08 --> 232.31900000000002
could concentrate

232.92 --> 238.98
and this morning

235.92 --> 241.439
yeah I feel a little sickish

238.98 --> 244.2
but yeah the the weather is nice at

241.439 --> 246.299
least and I had a good walk

244.2 --> 247.39999999999998
right before the show

246.299 --> 249.59900000000002
yeah

247.4 --> 251.81900000000002
basically out there

249.599 --> 254.7
the usual route

251.819 --> 258.019
enjoying nature and the Sun

254.7 --> 258.019
so that did a lot of good

259.199 --> 264.5
and had a caller call for my heat with

261.959 --> 264.5
my healer

264.72 --> 270.54
to kind of fix

266.82 --> 273.78
things and try to pinpoint like why

270.54 --> 277.86
am I feeling like this

273.78 --> 279.65999999999997
uh and what should I do about it Etc and

277.86 --> 282.8
really the biggest advice was to just

279.66 --> 282.8
stick to things

284.639 --> 289.199
close by that kind of matter

287.22 --> 291.0
because there's a lot of chaos going on

289.199 --> 293.699
in the world

291.0 --> 295.56
and there's really

293.699 --> 299.639
it's like

295.56 --> 302.4
is becoming intangible in certain ways

299.639 --> 305.40000000000003
and I should lay off

302.4 --> 308.21999999999997
more and not just right

305.4 --> 310.13899999999995
try to take responsibility and wield it

308.22 --> 313.62
when I

310.139 --> 318.979
can't really do anything with it

313.62 --> 318.979
other than point out what it is so yeah

323.4 --> 329.039
hello Nathan Oakley 1980 good to see you

326.58 --> 332.78
watching ad

329.039 --> 332.78
I get a lot of ads these days

332.94 --> 338.82
Google doesn't seem to be shying away

335.039 --> 341.419
from putting ads in my videos even when

338.82 --> 345.259
I watch my own video back

341.419 --> 345.25899999999996
get a lot of ads

346.44 --> 352.039
is anybody else noticing that

349.44 --> 352.039
it's weird

373.56 --> 376.16
right

377.039 --> 382.44
anyway I don't know if I'm gonna have

379.56 --> 385.16
like too active a show I do kind of feel

382.44 --> 385.16
a little feeble

385.5 --> 391.68
at least the weather is really nice and

388.979 --> 394.46
I don't know it's not bad like having a

391.68 --> 394.46
bit of an off day

398.94 --> 404.12
it's against YouTube guidelines to watch

401.34 --> 404.11999999999995
your own ads

405.0 --> 410.819
is it

407.58 --> 414.5
I don't actively seek them out

410.819 --> 414.5
and I do skip them right

425.699 --> 430.5
right anyway yeah yesterday's Flat Earth

427.919 --> 433.02
debate was great

430.5 --> 435.72
it was a lot of fun in the after show

433.02 --> 439.56
and I got a little bit more active

435.72 --> 440.90000000000003
and I had basically a full ball win

439.56 --> 443.94
go

440.9 --> 446.88
and even got weirdly enough some support

443.94 --> 449.16
from like

446.88 --> 450.65999999999997
from the other guys that were kind of

449.16 --> 455.3
like

450.66 --> 458.46000000000004
moving in on on what I was doing with me

455.3 --> 460.62
so that was kind of hilarious can't wait

458.46 --> 462.79999999999995
wait to watch back to premiere of all

460.62 --> 462.8
that

479.34 --> 486.85999999999996
just went to a forest oh

482.22 --> 486.86
that sounds great Nathan Oakley

492.12 --> 497.52
yes I had a I had a good walk

495.539 --> 500.15999999999997
in the forest too

497.52 --> 502.099
oh the forest it's it's a bit it's a

500.16 --> 505.02000000000004
very tiny little Forest

502.099 --> 506.94
but it's a great walking path

505.02 --> 509.58
and there's like all kinds of animals

506.94 --> 512.3389999999999
there so there's like always the geese

509.58 --> 516.06
on the road

512.339 --> 518.6400000000001
which is just hilarious I love geese

516.06 --> 521.5189999999999
and just like countless of other birds I

518.64 --> 524.06
even saw Falcons

521.519 --> 524.0600000000001
this time

524.219 --> 527.3000000000001
high up in the air

542.88 --> 547.08
okay Nathan hmm

549.24 --> 551.899
ah

572.459 --> 578.16
what Kevlar

574.92 --> 581.7199999999999
brutal Raptors what

578.16 --> 581.7199999999999
no they're Birds

593.32 --> 596.7090000000001
[Music]

598.14 --> 604.86
hmm right that's no yeah okay

602.64 --> 606.779
oh that sounds very familiar type of

604.86 --> 608.4590000000001
action if apple is doing that then

606.779 --> 610.459
they're kind of doing the same thing as

608.459 --> 612.3
what Bill Gates and Microsoft were doing

610.459 --> 614.04
a lot

612.3 --> 617.03
back in the day

614.04 --> 619.74
especially in the 90s

617.03 --> 622.38
[Music]

619.74 --> 624.9590000000001
it would literally buy up software

622.38 --> 627.2
companies and then just just shut them

624.959 --> 627.1999999999999
down

658.56 --> 661.04
oh

662.459 --> 665.2399999999999
okay

670.079 --> 676.9799999999999
all right I didn't realize that Nathan

673.38 --> 679.86
that Raptors actually

676.98 --> 682.38
traditionally points at the birds I

679.86 --> 684.3000000000001
thought that they were yeah watch too

682.38 --> 687.0
many movies I guess

684.3 --> 688.68
thought that it was specifically like

687.0 --> 692.579
lizards

688.68 --> 695.5999999999999
or something ah all right

692.579 --> 695.5999999999999
good to know

753.019 --> 757.86
I I was thinking Nathan like what a type

756.66 --> 760.62
of cat

757.86 --> 763.399
she meant car yeah

760.62 --> 763.399
hilarious

799.92 --> 804.0699999999999
man

800.79 --> 804.0699999999999
[Music]

811.5 --> 815.54
hold on I'll be right back in two

813.36 --> 815.54
minutes

833.88 --> 836.48
thank you

945.0 --> 947.18
foreign

968.16 --> 970.88
foreign

973.339 --> 976.639
and I'm back

976.94 --> 980.119
[Music]

985.68 --> 992.579
huh Jeff guess that really

989.699 --> 995.04
that's and that's an interesting idea

992.579 --> 998.5999999999999
the more car looks like an insect the

995.04 --> 998.5999999999999
more people like them hmm

1003.079 --> 1009.8
never thought of it like that but yeah

1006.019 --> 1012.4590000000001
there may be something to it

1009.8 --> 1012.459
shape

1014.839 --> 1018.8800000000001
uh Professor Phil Bell

1029.119 --> 1032.269
[Music]

1043.56 --> 1046.6799999999998
[Music]

1052.76 --> 1056.86
okay Adam Price really

1059.9 --> 1064.179
that's oh I think I get it

1066.02 --> 1071.9189999999999
that's pretty harsh though

1068.559 --> 1071.9189999999999
but fair

1087.32 --> 1090.32
foreign

1124.1 --> 1126.34
foreign

1128.26 --> 1131.679
good to see you

1150.14 --> 1152.98
oh man

1154.7 --> 1159.679
yeah guys so yeah today I'm a little

1157.1 --> 1161.8999999999999
wonky didn't really sleep all that well

1159.679 --> 1164.179
last night

1161.9 --> 1167.24
and like felt

1164.179 --> 1169.2800000000002
kind of sick even yesterday in the day

1167.24 --> 1171.86
and I feel like I'm still kind of

1169.28 --> 1173.539
recovering from that

1171.86 --> 1175.1599999999999
so I suspect I'll be a lot better

1173.539 --> 1178.1
tomorrow especially if it's going to be

1175.16 --> 1181.22
this nice weather again

1178.1 --> 1182.7199999999998
but yeah it's weird I feel now like I'm

1181.22 --> 1184.52
restoring to the point where I could

1182.72 --> 1187.539
just fall asleep

1184.52 --> 1187.539
this is

1189.08 --> 1194.12
but that's all right

1191.6 --> 1197.08
I'll probably do like a power nap after

1194.12 --> 1197.08
the show somewhere

1220.22 --> 1223.72
super vanilla what

1233.659 --> 1238.7800000000002
oh hey thanks rest Dad I'll check it out

1249.98 --> 1255.64
hmm

1251.24 --> 1255.64
thank you man I really appreciate that

1275.2 --> 1282.02
lots of people

1278.299 --> 1285.679
get lots of you streaming sleep oh God

1282.02 --> 1289.22
you mean like the asmr's sleep thing

1285.679 --> 1293.0590000000002
great yeah well sorry I'm not

1289.22 --> 1295.28
I'm not really interested I mean at this

1293.059 --> 1298.1589999999999
moment I'm kind of interested in falling

1295.28 --> 1300.08
asleep but that's not what my show is

1298.159 --> 1302.8400000000001
for like I'm not gonna show up to class

1300.08 --> 1306.039
and then literally just fall asleep

1302.84 --> 1306.039
that's ridiculous

1313.82 --> 1319.6589999999999
no I think I'm pretty I'm pretty much

1315.919 --> 1319.659
gonna be back to normal tomorrow

1320.299 --> 1325.82
I'm just gonna have like a really calm

1323.48 --> 1328.28
day today I'm really happy though that

1325.82 --> 1331.1
it's this kind of weather because that

1328.28 --> 1332.36
the stormy rainy weather it was really

1331.1 --> 1334.3999999999999
getting to me

1332.36 --> 1337.9599999999998
psychologically and so it's kind of a

1334.4 --> 1337.96
relief having a day like this now

1345.02 --> 1348.34
oh man

1389.48 --> 1394.039
hmm

1391.84 --> 1396.3999999999999
interesting slow-mo moonbuck you didn't

1394.039 --> 1396.4
know that

1396.74 --> 1399.4
hmm

1415.4 --> 1422.2
all right 20 years ago well 20 years ago

1418.94 --> 1425.539
people had a whole butt bunch of more

1422.2 --> 1428.419
protectiveness against

1425.539 --> 1432.14
psychological deviancy

1428.419 --> 1433.22
right Adam Price now it's like so out of

1432.14 --> 1437.0590000000002
control

1433.22 --> 1439.3600000000001
it's being like mental illness like in a

1437.059 --> 1440.8999999999999
way is being colonized

1439.36 --> 1443.9599999999998
exploited

1440.9 --> 1447.14
so there's just not the you the the

1443.96 --> 1449.5
normal groups of people halting it

1447.14 --> 1449.5
anymore

1450.38 --> 1454.88
they're not doing that now they've

1452.0 --> 1457.52
actually become part of that

1454.88 --> 1458.8400000000001
which is a really bad development by the

1457.52 --> 1462.74
way

1458.84 --> 1465.1399999999999
so yeah even though technically oh you

1462.74 --> 1469.1
can technically Maybe

1465.14 --> 1472.22
make money sleeping on video

1469.1 --> 1475.059
live streaming or something it's still

1472.22 --> 1475.059
ridiculous

1475.22 --> 1480.4
and just because you can doesn't always

1477.5 --> 1480.4
mean you should

1487.039 --> 1491.299
I mean in the long run if you're going

1489.5 --> 1493.6
to be part of that eventually you're

1491.299 --> 1495.32
only gonna

1493.6 --> 1498.08
encourage

1495.32 --> 1501.32
more people to basically slip into

1498.08 --> 1503.4189999999999
deranged thinking and behavior like

1501.32 --> 1506.96
everything is all right because you can

1503.419 --> 1510.98
make money being a complete idiot

1506.96 --> 1513.08
or literally wasting everybody's time

1510.98 --> 1515.6200000000001
and you get paid for that right it's

1513.08 --> 1515.62
like a

1517.46 --> 1522.26
a moral system would not

1520.279 --> 1526.46
do that

1522.26 --> 1528.14
so it's basically not demoralizing but

1526.46 --> 1531.6200000000001
like

1528.14 --> 1534.6200000000001
send yeah desensitizing or this

1531.62 --> 1534.62
sensibleizing

1536.539 --> 1541.779
it's just

1538.1 --> 1541.779
it's not good that that's out there

1542.9 --> 1546.039
hey Geo shifter

1567.08 --> 1569.26
foreign

1580.279 --> 1588.74
useless things it will lose value

1584.299 --> 1591.3799999999999
well what what will you lose value

1588.74 --> 1594.08
they're basically devaluating their own

1591.38 --> 1596.3600000000001
labor if they have any

1594.08 --> 1597.98
right because that's what you're doing

1596.36 --> 1600.62
if you're spending money on something

1597.98 --> 1603.14
that means that technically

1600.62 --> 1605.299
you should have made that through Labor

1603.14 --> 1607.5200000000002
and then you're spending it on somebody

1605.299 --> 1610.1
so

1607.52 --> 1612.32
you're devaluing your own labor by

1610.1 --> 1615.2199999999998
spending your money on completely

1612.32 --> 1615.22
useless things

1629.6 --> 1636.26
right in contrast to spending money on

1633.2 --> 1638.3600000000001
actual useful developing things

1636.26 --> 1641.299
then you actually

1638.36 --> 1643.82
kind of spiritually invest

1641.299 --> 1647.62
you invest wisely right like when you

1643.82 --> 1647.62
donate to my PayPal

1648.86 --> 1654.1999999999998
which is very useful it's provably

1651.08 --> 1656.4399999999998
useful it helps it helps me keeps it

1654.2 --> 1656.44
going

1656.539 --> 1661.52
gives

1657.74 --> 1664.36
everybody more opportunity

1661.52 --> 1664.36
to learn

1669.86 --> 1675.1589999999999
right but I'm not always in optimal form

1672.32 --> 1675.1589999999999
unfortunately

1686.899 --> 1692.9189999999999
I have constructed can't fight yeah stop

1689.96 --> 1692.919
traffic I'm arrested

1697.22 --> 1702.5
a full synthetic operation

1699.74 --> 1704.659
well I think that it's actually in a

1702.5 --> 1705.74
really sneaky way a controlled

1704.659 --> 1708.0200000000002
opposition

1705.74 --> 1713.6
operation

1708.02 --> 1713.6
it's actually a communist operation

1715.88 --> 1721.7
and it's it's allowing

1719.059 --> 1724.8799999999999
in this case well Trudeau to basically

1721.7 --> 1727.72
have a technical excuse to get

1724.88 --> 1727.72
dictatorial

1729.919 --> 1735.3200000000002
yeah it's just an unfortunate truth it's

1732.44 --> 1737.539
what it is and the people that were all

1735.32 --> 1738.5
part of it didn't seem to mind all that

1737.539 --> 1740.09
much

1738.5 --> 1743.76
they just wanted a party

1740.09 --> 1743.76
[Music]

1745.52 --> 1751.34
right now of course the aftermath is

1749.059 --> 1753.6789999999999
that people that did actually take it

1751.34 --> 1754.8799999999999
serious didn't really understand what

1753.679 --> 1757.039
was going on

1754.88 --> 1759.7990000000002
made themselves part of it they're now

1757.039 --> 1762.86
in the [ __ ]

1759.799 --> 1764.899
they are getting January 6th

1762.86 --> 1768.6789999999999
there yeah they're they're getting the

1764.899 --> 1772.4189999999999
same treatment as the January 6th

1768.679 --> 1772.419
people in America

1774.86 --> 1781.039
which is yeah I did call it right

1778.159 --> 1784.159
a lot of people by the way called that

1781.039 --> 1787.1589999999999
oh Benjamin called it others called it

1784.159 --> 1788.179
and pretty much all agreed upon the same

1787.159 --> 1790.279
day

1788.179 --> 1793.3400000000001
like yeah this is

1790.279 --> 1795.7
this is not what it seems to be on the

1793.34 --> 1795.6999999999998
surface

1821.12 --> 1823.36
foreign

1848.86 --> 1855.02
yeah rest that I get that

1851.84 --> 1857.6789999999999
there's others like there's convoys in

1855.02 --> 1857.679
Europe as well

1858.019 --> 1862.419
it did spread out quickly but

1864.08 --> 1869.96
I don't know what to do about it like I

1867.74 --> 1874.039
my mind like these are one of these

1869.96 --> 1876.26
things where I have to kind of let go I

1874.039 --> 1878.799
really have to let go

1876.26 --> 1878.799
because

1878.84 --> 1885.1
I I can't really

1881.6 --> 1885.1
really make sense of it

1888.86 --> 1895.039
I mean pointing out the roots it is like

1891.74 --> 1897.32
communist right it's these are communist

1895.039 --> 1900.08
tricks

1897.32 --> 1901.6399999999999
that the populists or something are

1900.08 --> 1903.6789999999999
doing

1901.64 --> 1905.3600000000001
but it just makes them kind of a

1903.679 --> 1907.94
controlled opposition

1905.36 --> 1910.36
to a communist system that's be that's

1907.94 --> 1910.3600000000001
growing

1911.179 --> 1915.44
because of that

1913.1 --> 1918.4399999999998
and I don't know what to do about it I I

1915.44 --> 1921.74
have no solution at this point

1918.44 --> 1925.96
so I just tried to not think about it

1921.74 --> 1925.96
really it's come to that

1926.96 --> 1930.26
just

1927.98 --> 1933.919
people everybody's gonna have to just

1930.26 --> 1936.559
figure it out themselves you know

1933.919 --> 1938.96
I've had I've made some very loud

1936.559 --> 1941.539
warnings in the last

1938.96 --> 1944.24
few months

1941.539 --> 1946.34
and

1944.24 --> 1949.059
yeah there's really nothing more that I

1946.34 --> 1949.059
feel I can do

1957.74 --> 1964.659
except just like not let it make me sick

1961.88 --> 1964.659
right

1964.88 --> 1971.48
not let the stress just like

1968.72 --> 1975.3990000000001
make drive me nuts

1971.48 --> 1975.3990000000001
that drive me physically ill

1975.74 --> 1981.32
because that is partially the thing that

1978.14 --> 1983.6200000000001
well it makes me sick made me sick

1981.32 --> 1983.62
yesterday

1984.38 --> 1990.98
instead I just

1986.96 --> 1993.32
I couldn't like a neurotic Puzzler

1990.98 --> 1995.0
at some point I just drift towards it

1993.32 --> 1997.399
and then I latch onto it and then I'm

1995.0 --> 2000.399
just trying to make sense of it but as I

1997.399 --> 2001.899
do that it it drains me really badly in

2000.399 --> 2004.899
certain ways

2001.899 --> 2007.779
because it is an unsolvable puzzle and

2004.899 --> 2011.279
yeah it's not this the solution is not

2007.779 --> 2011.279
all that straightforward with this

2017.62 --> 2025.6
yeah DX I agree oh Benjamin has

2021.12 --> 2028.1399999999999
had a pretty good grip on it with a lot

2025.6 --> 2028.1399999999999
of Comedy

2042.279 --> 2045.48
what right back

2046.48 --> 2050.5
foreign

2048.28 --> 2055.0
look I am caught

2050.5 --> 2057.339
it's just that my body's still taking a

2055.0 --> 2059.5
pounding from stress

2057.339 --> 2061.2999999999997
right just because my attitude or my

2059.5 --> 2063.339
demeanor in the moment is calm doesn't

2061.3 --> 2065.76
mean that that just takes everything

2063.339 --> 2065.7599999999998
away

2090.94 --> 2096.48
okay what don't worry it's

2107.74 --> 2114.1189999999997
this time this year trucks delivering

2110.98 --> 2114.119
supplies to Farms

2114.52 --> 2118.96
well Nathan art look are the trucks

2117.16 --> 2122.2
really

2118.96 --> 2124.42
not working anymore

2122.2 --> 2126.2799999999997
because that would not be in their own

2124.42 --> 2127.06
personal best interest and they'd know

2126.28 --> 2129.6600000000003
it

2127.06 --> 2129.66
right

2131.44 --> 2136.54
he said Owen Benjamin said like most of

2134.56 --> 2139.98
what we're seeing now they're protesting

2136.54 --> 2139.98
that's not even Truckers

2141.94 --> 2147.88
like the real truckers are still doing

2144.7 --> 2150.3999999999996
their job if they didn't then like

2147.88 --> 2153.94
things would seriously grind to a halt

2150.4 --> 2156.64
and it would be used as an excuse

2153.94 --> 2161.02
to then start decl declaring martial law

2156.64 --> 2162.1189999999997
and rolling out more disgusting greater

2161.02 --> 2165.48
reset

2162.119 --> 2165.48
agenda points

2169.78 --> 2174.82
when will these storms piss off I don't

2172.3 --> 2177.9
know land Lennox

2174.82 --> 2177.9
could take a while

2232.0 --> 2237.4
the best Claus show up

2235.26 --> 2241.1800000000003
impression ever

2237.4 --> 2246.2400000000002
no I can definitely do better

2241.18 --> 2250.54
you'll see the way that he talks is very

2246.24 --> 2252.5789999999997
contrived it's a very designed way of

2250.54 --> 2256.839
speaking

2252.579 --> 2260.32
I I am not even doing it all that well

2256.839 --> 2262.7799999999997
but it is almost like a

2260.32 --> 2265.599
yeah I can't do it I

2262.78 --> 2266.92
I'm too fluid in American to really do

2265.599 --> 2270.339
it properly

2266.92 --> 2274.9
I rolled too quickly but he's basically

2270.339 --> 2277.48
doing a a German accent

2274.9 --> 2280.5
and like holding on to that and how that

2277.48 --> 2280.5
is it's weird

2284.079 --> 2290.6800000000003
like that's not purely natural

2287.68 --> 2293.56
that that's like not purely natural how

2290.68 --> 2295.24
the Germans actually speak when they

2293.56 --> 2297.16
speak English when they actually learn

2295.24 --> 2300.04
to speak English

2297.16 --> 2303.7
right it's much more subtle

2300.04 --> 2305.68
so he's like on purpose doing that

2303.7 --> 2309.339
accent

2305.68 --> 2311.98
he is trying to be a lightning rod

2309.339 --> 2316.2999999999997
emperor

2311.98 --> 2319.0
like Star Wars Emperor Nazi King wannabe

2316.3 --> 2322.6600000000003
he he is doing that he is being like

2319.0 --> 2326.02
hello I am in the villain I am the

2322.66 --> 2329.8199999999997
villain it's like come on

2326.02 --> 2332.5
it's can't be more straightforward that

2329.82 --> 2335.02
like you couldn't think of something

2332.5 --> 2338.099
more straightforward

2335.02 --> 2338.099
than what he's doing

2390.16 --> 2392.8199999999997
hmm

2394.78 --> 2396.78
um

2417.76 --> 2425.2000000000003
I went smashing trees like we've laid

2420.22 --> 2428.14
had lately said never that's weird

2425.2 --> 2431.02
because that sort of storm does happen

2428.14 --> 2435.839
actually sometimes it usually doesn't

2431.02 --> 2435.839
get that hard but it sometimes does

2441.64 --> 2448.319
I mean at least it's it's not like

2444.22 --> 2448.319
genuine tornado strength or anything

2475.9 --> 2479.339
ah okay

2482.8 --> 2487.78
no I haven't seen that stream like

2485.619 --> 2491.76
Kevlar

2487.78 --> 2491.76
Rick back what you're talking about

2494.099 --> 2500.04
don't really fight like follow odd TV

2520.48 --> 2525.42
I can't remember that okay well Club

2522.94 --> 2525.42
Ruckus

2531.46 --> 2535.599
I mean you're just gonna have to trust

2533.26 --> 2538.3590000000004
his word on that but yeah I have like

2535.599 --> 2543.04
when I was taking my walk

2538.359 --> 2545.0789999999997
There Were Trees literally just split up

2543.04 --> 2547.96
but that's not the first time I've seen

2545.079 --> 2550.619
that though it you don't see that very

2547.96 --> 2550.619
often though

2551.8 --> 2557.26
I think like somewhere a decade ago

2553.96 --> 2559.96
there was a storm at some point as well

2557.26 --> 2561.94
that did that it's just they don't last

2559.96 --> 2565.5
very long but when they're there they

2561.94 --> 2565.5
like tear things apart

2595.24 --> 2598.24
foreign

2640.72 --> 2645.2999999999997
yeah Jeff gas head it's weird though

2646.72 --> 2652.0
right

2648.599 --> 2654.6400000000003
you will owe nothing and be happy

2652.0 --> 2658.18
I wonder sometimes if that isn't

2654.64 --> 2658.18
secretly projection

2660.94 --> 2666.2200000000003
right this super rich do they really own

2664.66 --> 2669.2799999999997
there are things

2666.22 --> 2672.04
or is it all very fluid could just go

2669.28 --> 2675.48
away at any moment because of their own

2672.04 --> 2675.48
priorite priorities

2678.22 --> 2684.7599999999998
like do they technically own anything

2682.24 --> 2686.7999999999997
or they just want to rule and so

2684.76 --> 2691.92
everything they own is all just

2686.8 --> 2691.92
basically meaningless and fluid to them

2711.4 --> 2713.88
right

2719.44 --> 2723.64
my God

2721.24 --> 2725.74
man I'm yawning like I just haven't

2723.64 --> 2727.92
slept at all which is weird because I

2725.74 --> 2727.9199999999996
have

2729.76 --> 2734.4
you will eat the bugs no

2776.619 --> 2781.859
are you getting wisdom

2779.319 --> 2781.859
all right

2786.16 --> 2792.7
well it's simple you know

2789.52 --> 2795.88
nobody will own anything if we in this

2792.7 --> 2797.859
period let them steal everything so it's

2795.88 --> 2800.5
basically their declaration we're gonna

2797.859 --> 2802.2999999999997
loot you all

2800.5 --> 2804.66
that's how you're gonna end up with

2802.3 --> 2804.6600000000003
nothing

2813.64 --> 2819.819
or it could signify like

2816.72 --> 2823.48
their specific system that they're

2819.819 --> 2825.339
setting up that like in that system you

2823.48 --> 2828.4
technically owe nothing you can still

2825.339 --> 2832.2999999999997
have some power or grip or whatever

2828.4 --> 2835.1800000000003
but it won't help you to actually

2832.3 --> 2836.8
financially improve yourself

2835.18 --> 2839.319
to grow out of that

2836.8 --> 2841.7200000000003
so the system they set up is like there

2839.319 --> 2845.099
to be take part in but it won't allow

2841.72 --> 2845.0989999999997
you to actually upgrade

2858.76 --> 2864.28
the barter system could be back yeah

2862.24 --> 2867.0989999999997
but the true problem with Communism

2864.28 --> 2870.1600000000003
though is that if it gets really bad

2867.099 --> 2873.52
they will literally just make you make

2870.16 --> 2877.66
everything illegal like even

2873.52 --> 2880.72
like having a garden like just having a

2877.66 --> 2882.94
garden of any sort would be illegal

2880.72 --> 2885.339
yeah what do you do then

2882.94 --> 2887.8
I mean yeah you can do anything

2885.339 --> 2890.68
but do you have like

2887.8 --> 2892.6600000000003
the rebellious Defense Forces to

2890.68 --> 2894.46
actually just be able to do it without

2892.66 --> 2898.859
being interrupted

2894.46 --> 2898.859
by communist military arresting you

2899.2 --> 2904.4399999999996
right how are you going to have anything

2901.0 --> 2904.44
when everything is illegal

2904.96 --> 2909.46
and you're going to be mocked anytime

2906.579 --> 2912.579
you do any basic thing

2909.46 --> 2914.92
right that's the problem that's why

2912.579 --> 2917.38
communism like this hardcore

2914.92 --> 2922.6800000000003
neo-communism

2917.38 --> 2922.6800000000003
is absolutely intolerable and untenable

2923.28 --> 2929.26
and should be fought off with maximum

2927.16 --> 2932.7
effort

2929.26 --> 2932.7000000000003
even unto death

2935.98 --> 2942.579
there is no going along going along with

2938.5 --> 2945.4
it is literally dooming yourself

2942.579 --> 2948.94
your progeny and the world

2945.4 --> 2949.67
and all life and potentially everyone's

2948.94 --> 2951.04
soul

2949.67 --> 2953.859
[Music]

2951.04 --> 2955.48
including that of your Offspring if you

2953.859 --> 2959.2
even have any

2955.48 --> 2962.92
anybody you care about right that's why

2959.2 --> 2964.7799999999997
you shouldn't ever even consider like

2962.92 --> 2966.78
going along with it

2964.78 --> 2971.5
should be fought off with great

2966.78 --> 2971.5
ferocious tenacity ferocious

2987.88 --> 2991.079
what was that

3024.78 --> 3030.1400000000003
uh debunk floater is projecting again

3032.339 --> 3035.94
let's come on guys that's just pure

3034.319 --> 3038.46
projection

3035.94 --> 3041.2200000000003
this guy is in desperate need of

3038.46 --> 3043.14
psychiatric help

3041.22 --> 3046.5589999999997
and apparently he doesn't have any

3043.14 --> 3049.2599999999998
relevance that care a [ __ ] about him I

3046.559 --> 3051.3590000000004
think that he's become so gross and

3049.26 --> 3053.7000000000003
disgusting

3051.359 --> 3054.96
in his looks and its behavior and his

3053.7 --> 3058.4399999999996
habits

3054.96 --> 3060.839
that they all just disowned them him

3058.44 --> 3063.96
and basically no longer want to

3060.839 --> 3068.099
recognize he exists so he's now just

3063.96 --> 3071.099
stuck with his own demonic spirit

3068.099 --> 3073.7400000000002
with no way out except rejection

3071.099 --> 3076.819
projecting onto other people that aren't

3073.74 --> 3076.819
in that situation

3098.339 --> 3104.16
all right besides it's all just nonsense

3101.339 --> 3107.0
anyway right I've been yesterday I

3104.16 --> 3107.0
talked about it a little

3107.48 --> 3113.46
psychiatric help

3110.28 --> 3115.8590000000004
that's yeah no but nobody needs

3113.46 --> 3119.28
psychiatric help unless

3115.859 --> 3122.22
they can be proven to have like the

3119.28 --> 3124.3190000000004
ranged behavior that literally causes

3122.22 --> 3128.2799999999997
damage

3124.319 --> 3130.94
that causes people to get hurt

3128.28 --> 3130.94
physically

3135.3 --> 3139.6800000000003
well

3137.28 --> 3142.26
if you could point at what I'm doing

3139.68 --> 3144.72
that's actually provably causing

3142.26 --> 3148.6400000000003
physical hurt

3144.72 --> 3148.64
I'd be interested to hear your case

3151.5 --> 3155.52
because I'm pretty sure I don't

3153.38 --> 3158.76
including myself

3155.52 --> 3161.0
like yeah I do take pretty good care of

3158.76 --> 3161.0
myself

3161.04 --> 3166.22
doesn't mean that I'm always gonna feel

3163.14 --> 3166.22
like perfect

3167.94 --> 3172.88
but yeah I take my health very serious

3170.22 --> 3172.8799999999997
take

3173.7 --> 3178.7999999999997
the truth

3175.68 --> 3180.8999999999996
and honesty very serious

3178.8 --> 3184.26
including like

3180.9 --> 3186.78
yeah less Media train opinions and

3184.26 --> 3190.5
attitudes

3186.78 --> 3194.52
right but those are just expressions

3190.5 --> 3197.16
and it's even like notified as to what

3194.52 --> 3200.339
it is like what it is and what's behind

3197.16 --> 3202.44
it when I say it I'm very specific when

3200.339 --> 3204.18
I do it I don't just blabber out

3202.44 --> 3205.859
something super aggressive and then

3204.18 --> 3207.7799999999997
pretend it never happened and then never

3205.859 --> 3211.02
address it again

3207.78 --> 3214.1400000000003
so that it's a wild statement and nobody

3211.02 --> 3217.319
knows what it means no I explain

3214.14 --> 3222.24
my kind of wild statements every time

3217.319 --> 3226.7
I'm very specific I'm unmistakable

3222.24 --> 3226.7
like how would that cause harm

3228.0 --> 3230.72
it won't

3232.319 --> 3239.22
so yeah there's lit you can't you cannot

3237.3 --> 3241.04
get me

3239.22 --> 3243.9599999999996
like

3241.04 --> 3245.819
institutionalized like you couldn't make

3243.96 --> 3249.68
a case for that

3245.819 --> 3249.68
like why didn't you try it

3251.04 --> 3255.24
right somebody that might be in chat

3253.02 --> 3259.079
that would actually try they might just

3255.24 --> 3261.4199999999996
actually end up themselves in one of

3259.079 --> 3264.96
these institutes because they are truly

3261.42 --> 3268.52
deranged and seek to ruin people's lives

3264.96 --> 3268.52
yeah that's not something I'm doing

3269.4 --> 3273.96
like not even in the distance I don't

3271.559 --> 3276.2400000000002
seek to ruin people's lives

3273.96 --> 3279.18
actually seek

3276.24 --> 3281.8799999999997
to give them more grip

3279.18 --> 3284.0989999999997
on the situations and that even if

3281.88 --> 3286.38
things go to [ __ ] naturally in their

3284.099 --> 3288.48
lives that they will then be able to

3286.38 --> 3291.54
evolve out of it

3288.48 --> 3295.079
spiritually evolve and figure out

3291.54 --> 3298.619
avoid falling into pit traps from your

3295.079 --> 3300.48
past and being able to work their way

3298.619 --> 3303.599
through it

3300.48 --> 3306.0
right that's what I do so how is any of

3303.599 --> 3307.1400000000003
that anything I do is how is it causing

3306.0 --> 3309.54
harm

3307.14 --> 3312.0789999999997
except maybe getting some people really

3309.54 --> 3312.079
triggered

3317.7 --> 3320.24
all right

3334.799 --> 3339.42
so every time a troll does something

3337.079 --> 3343.079
like that it's not

3339.42 --> 3346.76
just a stupid threat it's a idle threat

3343.079 --> 3346.76
it doesn't actually work

3347.04 --> 3354.599
right sometimes like I I go to comment

3351.66 --> 3355.859
sections and news sites and all that RT

3354.599 --> 3358.5
for example

3355.859 --> 3362.16
and then I get like really brutal in a

3358.5 --> 3366.54
comment somewhere like super harsh

3362.16 --> 3369.96
like or like Ultra Mega right wing

3366.54 --> 3373.2599999999998
like but not just like oh cool but just

3369.96 --> 3375.18
Ultra Mega right wing like the most

3373.26 --> 3378.0200000000004
extreme right thing you could pretty

3375.18 --> 3379.7
much imagine that is still

3378.02 --> 3383.04
reasonable

3379.7 --> 3384.5989999999997
right I push everything like that and

3383.04 --> 3388.02
there's people responding to that like

3384.599 --> 3389.7000000000003
oh you maniac you better consult a

3388.02 --> 3392.28
lawyer because oh you're going to be in

3389.7 --> 3395.52
trouble and I'm like no I'm not

3392.28 --> 3398.46
this is free speech like what I can

3395.52 --> 3401.16
literally say every part of this

3398.46 --> 3403.98
have you checked with the lawyer

3401.16 --> 3407.819
to actually like dissect the words that

3403.98 --> 3409.559
I use and how I say it right it's like I

3407.819 --> 3413.2799999999997
can say all those things and there's

3409.559 --> 3415.1600000000003
nothing you can do about it right

3413.28 --> 3418.92
I might be

3415.16 --> 3420.66
attitudinal not very Media train

3418.92 --> 3425.16
but like

3420.66 --> 3427.5
really like judicially in a way I am

3425.16 --> 3431.3999999999996
very media trained

3427.5 --> 3434.64
I need to in order to be able to do the

3431.4 --> 3437.76
things that I do and be as brazened and

3434.64 --> 3441.359
direct and super pissed off sometimes

3437.76 --> 3445.38
and reiji I need

3441.359 --> 3448.2
perfection in what I express

3445.38 --> 3450.0
that I never get caught saying something

3448.2 --> 3452.04
really stupid that would get me in

3450.0 --> 3454.44
trouble

3452.04 --> 3457.799
right

3454.44 --> 3459.66
and I manage I managed to be able to do

3457.799 --> 3462.599
that and there's still people squirting

3459.66 --> 3464.7
at me like oh you're a monster is like

3462.599 --> 3465.96
no no no no no

3464.7 --> 3469.6189999999997
right

3465.96 --> 3472.079
sue me do it then come on

3469.619 --> 3474.359
take my words take my videos take my

3472.079 --> 3477.059
comments and do it

3474.359 --> 3479.22
see what you can do about it you can't

3477.059 --> 3481.38
do anything about it

3479.22 --> 3484.2599999999998
the way that I say it there's nothing

3481.38 --> 3488.099
you can do about it just nothing you can

3484.26 --> 3491.579
do to stop me from saying the things

3488.099 --> 3493.319
that I want to say the way I want to say

3491.579 --> 3496.6800000000003
them

3493.319 --> 3497.88
you understand trolley boys overly

3496.68 --> 3500.299
triggered

3497.88 --> 3504.0
Stasi wannabe

3500.299 --> 3506.88
bastards yeah there's nothing you can do

3504.0 --> 3509.04
I can say the things that I say the way

3506.88 --> 3511.859
that I say and there's nothing you can

3509.04 --> 3513.48
do about it why don't you try why don't

3511.859 --> 3517.14
you try me

3513.48 --> 3520.44
yeah you're not gonna Bluff me or like

3517.14 --> 3524.0989999999997
scare me or like oh no the starzy will

3520.44 --> 3526.38
come back no I know what I'm saying I

3524.099 --> 3529.1400000000003
know that it triggers people

3526.38 --> 3531.42
and I'm still doing it

3529.14 --> 3532.5589999999997
because I'm doing it in a very specific

3531.42 --> 3535.02
way

3532.559 --> 3538.079
that I know

3535.02 --> 3540.9
like I'm covered by the way that I say

3538.079 --> 3542.4
it there's nothing you can do about it I

3540.9 --> 3545.88
I can

3542.4 --> 3548.88
share free opinions like even if they

3545.88 --> 3551.7000000000003
are very unreasonable and brutally harsh

3548.88 --> 3553.98
like unreasonably harsh I can shift

3551.7 --> 3557.7
still say that

3553.98 --> 3559.98
I can say it there's nothing you can do

3557.7 --> 3563.52
about it

3559.98 --> 3565.7400000000002
unless a bunch of stassi trigger soy

3563.52 --> 3568.46
boys are in control and that will just

3565.74 --> 3568.4599999999996
censor anything

3568.74 --> 3577.02
right if it's if anybody gets scared

3573.72 --> 3580.799
right but that's not really judicial

3577.02 --> 3582.9
like they won't be able to just come

3580.799 --> 3585.54
after me for that

3582.9 --> 3588.48
they might just delete it

3585.54 --> 3591.079
they can't come after me for that that

3588.48 --> 3591.079
doesn't work

3596.22 --> 3603.18
how dare you be right wing yeah but it's

3599.16 --> 3606.7799999999997
beyond like the gay right because right

3603.18 --> 3612.359
wing right now in the world most of it

3606.78 --> 3615.48
is really really gay which is not

3612.359 --> 3618.119
right-wing really

3615.48 --> 3620.22
so I'm already like way more right-wing

3618.119 --> 3623.579
than most

3620.22 --> 3625.4399999999996
but sometimes I like I just get a little

3623.579 --> 3627.8390000000004
like

3625.44 --> 3630.059
a little bit of 19th century like

3627.839 --> 3634.38
misogynism or something like I just I

3630.059 --> 3636.78
just gotta do it I just have to do that

3634.38 --> 3639.319
because I can because I can express that

3636.78 --> 3639.3190000000004
opinion

3640.98 --> 3648.059
let's hope people's lives dedicating

3644.48 --> 3650.339
dedicated to like fight that off never

3648.059 --> 3651.5400000000004
back to that and I'm like yeah I'm going

3650.339 --> 3653.5789999999997
there

3651.54 --> 3656.22
I want back

3653.579 --> 3659.04
I want to nullify like the entire

3656.22 --> 3660.1189999999997
feminist Revolution from the start all

3659.04 --> 3664.4
of it

3660.119 --> 3664.4
complete nullification all of it

3665.46 --> 3673.14
why because it's kind of a disaster

3669.359 --> 3675.18
it kind of really is a disaster

3673.14 --> 3680.1189999999997
that's handed

3675.18 --> 3683.0989999999997
a big big chunk of female Humanity

3680.119 --> 3685.5
straight into Satan's hands

3683.099 --> 3687.78
and like we won't be able to get them

3685.5 --> 3690.74
out of those hands

3687.78 --> 3690.7400000000002
that's why

3709.14 --> 3712.16
with that yeah

3712.74 --> 3719.4599999999996
that doesn't mean that there are women

3715.44 --> 3723.18
that I actually really respect

3719.46 --> 3725.88
right it's not it has nothing to do

3723.18 --> 3727.859
with how I think that people should

3725.88 --> 3732.38
communicate with one another

3727.859 --> 3732.38
no it's more of a societal opinion

3739.26 --> 3745.3190000000004
uh oh you follow her to say yeah this

3741.78 --> 3748.039
well let them squirt you know

3745.319 --> 3748.0389999999998
I don't care

3751.74 --> 3755.0
do you spread the word

3756.299 --> 3761.599
I want to nullified all women's rights

3766.26 --> 3768.7990000000004
right

3769.559 --> 3775.1400000000003
let women be women

3771.9 --> 3778.7400000000002
because women's rights is what actually

3775.14 --> 3781.2599999999998
forces them to not be women

3778.74 --> 3784.5
because of women's rights

3781.26 --> 3787.7990000000004
and vast majority

3784.5 --> 3791.46
of females in the western world is

3787.799 --> 3794.94
turning are becoming horse

3791.46 --> 3797.46
like actual prostitutes that manipulate

3794.94 --> 3799.26
men with sex

3797.46 --> 3802.7
for their own Advantage their own

3799.26 --> 3802.7000000000003
egotistical advantage

3805.619 --> 3808.7000000000003
that's terrible

3818.819 --> 3825.98
does that mean I don't get the vote any

3821.039 --> 3825.98
longer yeah no that's right you won't

3828.18 --> 3831.2599999999998
sorry brandem

3839.28 --> 3842.28
it's just

3840.839 --> 3845.0389999999998
ugh

3842.28 --> 3846.48
I don't really want to like make this an

3845.039 --> 3849.3590000000004
item it is

3846.48 --> 3850.98
I'm doing this a bit in Owen Benjamin's

3849.359 --> 3855.68
shadow

3850.98 --> 3855.68
but I really kind of do agree with it

3859.14 --> 3864.18
I think that Humanity would have been

3862.26 --> 3866.48
better off if like none of that would

3864.18 --> 3866.48
have happened

3867.24 --> 3871.5
or

3869.22 --> 3873.8999999999996
or if it yeah it's so tough right

3871.5 --> 3876.539
because yeah of course women

3873.9 --> 3880.339
like there's been really good feminists

3876.539 --> 3880.3390000000004
too right that are just like

3882.42 --> 3886.819
for example spread

3884.579 --> 3891.48
female

3886.819 --> 3893.22
occupancy hazardous awareness

3891.48 --> 3896.18
like the importance for example of

3893.22 --> 3896.18
breastfeeding so

3898.619 --> 3903.44
yeah

3899.24 --> 3903.4399999999996
you're not a woman Brenda

3903.78 --> 3906.6800000000003
you're not a woman

3914.94 --> 3919.859
you value having two vote yeah because

3916.98 --> 3922.68
you've been told to value that

3919.859 --> 3925.68
why are you even valuing voting in

3922.68 --> 3929.22
general it's a disaster out there house

3925.68 --> 3932.0989999999997
voting worked out for you all huh oh but

3929.22 --> 3935.339
you got your female voting oh it's so

3932.099 --> 3938.9
important oh really so how is voting out

3935.339 --> 3938.9
there going in general

3948.66 --> 3954.44
how about we take away your rights

3952.44 --> 3954.44
um

3956.76 --> 3964.1600000000003
well men can just kind of naturally

3960.599 --> 3964.1600000000003
learn to defend themselves

3965.7 --> 3970.5
right

3967.92 --> 3972.0
the only real right you have is the one

3970.5 --> 3977.0
you claim

3972.0 --> 3977.0
rights are claimed they're not given

3977.7 --> 3982.9199999999996
right if you're given a right that's

3980.099 --> 3986.46
just a false promise really

3982.92 --> 3987.78
because no yeah if somebody doesn't care

3986.46 --> 3990.98
about that right they're just gonna

3987.78 --> 3994.44
violate it it's only when you actually

3990.98 --> 3997.579
claim that right and defend it that you

3994.44 --> 3997.579
actually have that right

4013.819 --> 4017.74
right

4015.079 --> 4017.7400000000002
anyway

4023.539 --> 4029.8390000000004
yeah the thing is though is that

4026.9 --> 4032.6600000000003
look the Dynamics that I have in mind

4029.839 --> 4035.92
which are old-fashioned Dynamics

4032.66 --> 4035.92
social dynamics

4036.2 --> 4041.0789999999997
they effectively do kind of like

4041.359 --> 4049.5789999999997
men will have to uphold a very critical

4045.859 --> 4052.0989999999997
Honor Code towards women right

4049.579 --> 4054.98
you realize that that actually gives

4052.099 --> 4056.48
women more power

4054.98 --> 4058.94
do you understand

4056.48 --> 4062.2400000000002
that the old system

4058.94 --> 4065.359
where women didn't have equal rights

4062.24 --> 4068.359
they had more power

4065.359 --> 4070.16
women had more power than men

4068.359 --> 4073.94
because men

4070.16 --> 4076.72
would be forced to the honor code when

4073.94 --> 4076.7200000000003
dealing with women

4077.539 --> 4082.88
how's that working out right now with

4079.819 --> 4085.0589999999997
equal huh how is that working out for

4082.88 --> 4085.059
you

4088.16 --> 4093.98
yeah now nobody gives a [ __ ]

4091.52 --> 4096.14
nobody cares about your attitude nobody

4093.98 --> 4099.46
cares about your [ __ ] or whatever you

4096.14 --> 4099.46
know nobody cares

4100.58 --> 4108.5
yeah well 200 years ago men cared

4105.44 --> 4110.3589999999995
men cared about women

4108.5 --> 4113.6
they would sometimes dedicate their

4110.359 --> 4115.839
entire lives to protecting them or their

4113.6 --> 4115.839
wife

4123.259 --> 4128.179
so yeah

4125.42 --> 4131.659
I'm not saying like oh let's go back

4128.179 --> 4133.64
right now no no no I'm just saying I

4131.659 --> 4135.739
personally wish it all never happened

4133.64 --> 4138.219
like that I think the world would have

4135.739 --> 4138.218999999999
been better

4138.38 --> 4142.58
I'm not here to take away your rights

4141.38 --> 4145.04
women

4142.58 --> 4147.5
especially brand am I really like you

4145.04 --> 4150.08
please don't take it personal Brenda can

4147.5 --> 4153.259
go [ __ ] himself I don't care what you

4150.08 --> 4156.3189999999995
think you're an sjw [ __ ]

4153.259 --> 4158.56
without an actual [ __ ] nobody gives a

4156.319 --> 4158.56
[ __ ]

4158.719 --> 4165.46
but people women that I care about I do

4162.14 --> 4165.46
care about so

4166.58 --> 4171.3189999999995
I'm sorry to Brent M and I'm sorry

4169.94 --> 4173.239
to

4171.319 --> 4175.1
seeking star water

4173.239 --> 4178.4
although I don't I think that seeking

4175.1 --> 4181.06
star water gets it though

4178.4 --> 4181.0599999999995
like

4202.94 --> 4207.919999999999
I want to take away oh did I did I say

4206.719 --> 4209.9
that

4207.92 --> 4213.9800000000005

4209.9 --> 4216.32
you don't know how to listen yeah you're

4213.98 --> 4219.259999999999
projecting you want to take away

4216.32 --> 4222.58
people's rights no that's not what I

4219.26 --> 4225.679
said I just said that

4222.58 --> 4227.96
if women would have never gotten those

4225.679 --> 4230.42
rights if that [ __ ] wouldn't have

4227.96 --> 4233.42
unrolled the way it has

4230.42 --> 4236.32
women would have been better off for it

4233.42 --> 4236.32
right now

4239.12 --> 4247.36
yes you did no I didn't go [ __ ] yourself

4242.08 --> 4247.36
Brenda liar get out

4247.58 --> 4250.9
this is where you go

4265.1 --> 4267.34
foreign

but it is lengthy I bet you do seeking

4277.58 --> 4280.0
star water

4311.42 --> 4313.96
hmm

4315.02 --> 4318.88
smile at the Navy there

4319.82 --> 4322.48
okay

4344.719 --> 4349.4
yeah just because you call yourself a

4347.239 --> 4353.839999999999
woman doesn't actually give you women's

4349.4 --> 4356.0599999999995
rights yeah because you are not a woman

4353.84 --> 4358.400000000001
you can think of yourself as one that

4356.06 --> 4360.64
doesn't actually give you the rights of

4358.4 --> 4360.639999999999
one

4370.82 --> 4375.799999999999
oh well

4372.8 --> 4378.8
what the ever the [ __ ] you are with the

4375.8 --> 4381.58
weird code

4378.8 --> 4386.659000000001
yeah you're not really doing any better

4381.58 --> 4389.96
right you're actually going around

4386.659 --> 4392.9
and other people's chats

4389.96 --> 4395.6
and just [ __ ] on them

4392.9 --> 4397.58
right how is that actually being

4395.6 --> 4399.92
productive how are you being productive

4397.58 --> 4401.48
right I'm having a show I'm providing a

4399.92 --> 4403.76
platform I'm

4403.76 --> 4410.08
people out sharing data

4406.64 --> 4410.08
how are you being productive

4410.12 --> 4417.88
how is this productive wobbly wobble

4413.239 --> 4417.879999999999
whatever the [ __ ] you're supposed to be

4436.699 --> 4443.9

4450.98 --> 4453.58
right

4455.6 --> 4461.179
but yeah I do give away answers for free

4458.36 --> 4462.679
and hey if something is a really serious

4461.179 --> 4465.5
question

4462.679 --> 4467.54
then I will might just still give it

4465.5 --> 4471.52
away for free if I think it's really

4467.54 --> 4471.5199999999995
important that it is answered

4473.48 --> 4479.12
right and hey if people want to pay me

4476.96 --> 4480.8
for it

4479.12 --> 4483.46
it's optional

4480.8 --> 4483.46
you can

4486.44 --> 4489.099999999999
right

4491.54 --> 4497.239
so yeah I'm still being paid by my

4494.54 --> 4498.26
government we were getting attacks oh

4497.239 --> 4501.379999999999
yeah

4498.26 --> 4504.8
yeah I'm the drain on the tax I mean I'm

4501.38 --> 4507.56
I'm trying to do something right

4504.8 --> 4510.38
how's all those people out there that

4507.56 --> 4514.280000000001
aren't even trying to do [ __ ] that are

4510.38 --> 4515.6
just rolling around in SGA W crap all

4514.28 --> 4517.4
day

4515.6 --> 4520.76
or just like

4517.4 --> 4523.759999999999
like just get murder obsessed with

4520.76 --> 4527.3
freaking psycho games and whatever like

4523.76 --> 4528.92
oh but they are they're great they're so

4527.3 --> 4531.4400000000005
good for everybody and they bet they

4528.92 --> 4534.8
have jobs that are so productive that

4531.44 --> 4536.78
everybody wants like hey let's nag

4534.8 --> 4539.179
people on the phone

4536.78 --> 4542.259999999999
that's a great job that's so productive

4539.179 --> 4544.9400000000005
everybody's really happy with that right

4542.26 --> 4548.2390000000005
they'd realize that that is actually

4544.94 --> 4550.5199999999995
also being tax funded like most things

4548.239 --> 4554.12
in the Netherlands are effectively being

4550.52 --> 4557.0
held up through tax funding a lot it is

4554.12 --> 4558.8
this is how it works

4557.0 --> 4561.8
yeah

4558.8 --> 4563.54
so what is it that you actually produce

4561.8 --> 4565.1
all together how is that being

4563.54 --> 4568.699
productive then

4565.1 --> 4571.34
I mean I can point at how my activities

4568.699 --> 4574.54
are productive on the long run what is

4571.34 --> 4574.54
your job

4574.88 --> 4579.32
what do you actually do can can you lay

4578.0 --> 4582.5
it out

4579.32 --> 4585.04
what it is you do and how that is being

4582.5 --> 4585.04
productive

4585.199 --> 4590.48
because so far all I got is personal

4588.62 --> 4592.88
at-home attacks

4590.48 --> 4594.98
and criticizing

4592.88 --> 4597.8
the people on the internet for not

4594.98 --> 4601.54
making enough money

4597.8 --> 4601.54
so how is that being productive

4602.78 --> 4608.0599999999995
yeah Lydia logs but yeah

4606.08 --> 4612.0199999999995
but you're okay

4608.06 --> 4615.159000000001
I'm asking this troll person here

4612.02 --> 4615.159000000001
with the Thai name

4620.09 --> 4623.999
[Music]

4625.64 --> 4632.719
so productive you're so important your

4630.02 --> 4634.34
information is vital man how could we

4632.719 --> 4636.8
live without you

4634.34 --> 4639.88
how could we live without all that

4636.8 --> 4639.88
critical input

4660.08 --> 4663.28
you're deflecting

4665.9 --> 4671.0599999999995
or do you mean you are deflecting Arwen

4669.32 --> 4672.759999999999
blue 4J

4671.06 --> 4677.6
I don't know

4672.76 --> 4679.900000000001
you're and you are are not the same

4677.6 --> 4679.900000000001
thing

4680.3 --> 4682.78
anyway

4701.0 --> 4704.56
yeah Matthew I could be

4711.92 --> 4716.12
all right

4713.12 --> 4718.46
my hair is fabulous

4716.12 --> 4721.78
well

4718.46 --> 4721.78
I like my hair

4721.94 --> 4728.12
I'm very happy with my hair and how it's

4724.52 --> 4730.1
not incredibly rapidly going bold like

4728.12 --> 4734.26
most people

4730.1 --> 4734.26
for 42 this is pretty damn good

4735.44 --> 4741.379999999999
like in ways

4738.199 --> 4743.419999999999
yeah my father too right my father did

4741.38 --> 4746.2390000000005
kind of lose most of it well not most of

4743.42 --> 4749.6
his but he has lost some hair but he's

4746.239 --> 4749.599999999999
like 70.

4751.1 --> 4757.820000000001
but with him too it lasted very long and

4754.82 --> 4760.4
I'm just keeping very I'm very being

4757.82 --> 4764.599999999999
very careful with my hair

4760.4 --> 4767.0599999999995
so I take pretty good care of it and so

4764.6 --> 4770.4400000000005
it'll last very long hopefully

4767.06 --> 4770.4400000000005
and I'm not ashamed

4771.56 --> 4778.2390000000005
there's do you even know that there's

4774.14 --> 4778.2390000000005
people literally jealous of my hair

4780.62 --> 4786.0199999999995
but just admit that

4782.9 --> 4790.179
so it's really not that bad I don't know

4786.02 --> 4790.179
why some people just can't handle it

4802.06 --> 4806.780000000001
okay Lydia looks that's that's good to

4804.62 --> 4810.34
hear yeah mctoon he's okay he's an

4806.78 --> 4810.34
anti-flat earth though but he's okay

4813.8 --> 4818.719
yeah but he didn't get on though which

4816.56 --> 4820.400000000001
is too bad maybe he'll get on the live

4818.719 --> 4822.86
show today

4820.4 --> 4826.42
talking of which I'm gonna probably

4822.86 --> 4826.42
round out the show somewhere soon

4827.6 --> 4832.84
you're growing out your Goldilocks what

4830.3 --> 4832.84
at least you

4841.639 --> 4847.58
Nathan ran pretty fast I don't know I

4844.76 --> 4849.4400000000005
think that Nathan he didn't know mctoon

4847.58 --> 4851.659
was in there

4849.44 --> 4853.759999999999
we talked about it in the after show and

4851.659 --> 4855.5599999999995
then he tried to get him on but then

4853.76 --> 4858.7390000000005
mctoon left because apparently he

4855.56 --> 4860.900000000001
insisted on being on the live show

4858.739 --> 4863.839999999999
so but anyway this is just yesterday

4860.9 --> 4865.46
maybe today he will get on that would be

4863.84 --> 4869.1990000000005
interesting

4865.46 --> 4869.199
maybe he's already on there I don't know

4873.62 --> 4878.48
bald men are extremely insecure I don't

4876.199 --> 4881.86
get that

4878.48 --> 4881.86
I don't get that rig back

4883.1 --> 4888.159000000001
I mean

4885.32 --> 4892.04
there's some really badass bald guys

4888.159 --> 4894.5599999999995
like that are like bald and still have

4892.04 --> 4897.08
some hair that are freaking badass why

4894.56 --> 4901.34
because they don't get distracted and

4897.08 --> 4904.219
they own it right they own that hair

4901.34 --> 4907.78
and like I don't get it I don't get why

4904.219 --> 4907.78
people can be so insecure

4908.239 --> 4911.62
when they don't have the hair

4912.739 --> 4917.9
I mean it I guess it does take a bit of

4915.08 --> 4921.38
like the young Bluster out of you

4917.9 --> 4925.54
but you can run with that too

4921.38 --> 4929.78
like you can just own the olderness

4925.54 --> 4932.06
attitude which is it works so yeah

4929.78 --> 4934.46
there's really no good reason to be

4932.06 --> 4936.9800000000005
insecure if you're a man

4934.46 --> 4941.38
and you have a ball you have a bald spot

4936.98 --> 4941.379999999999
or whatever partially bold

4942.26 --> 4947.179
I think that if you completely shave

4944.78 --> 4949.219
your head completely bald

4947.179 --> 4951.88
that's kind of more of a sign of

4949.219 --> 4951.88
insecurity

4951.92 --> 4958.34
right because then you're really trying

4954.92 --> 4961.1
to a lot of times hide that you are

4958.34 --> 4963.82
partially bold that's insecure you're

4961.1 --> 4963.820000000001
trying to hide it

4963.86 --> 4968.38
or you have a cap on or whatever no own

4966.139 --> 4968.38
it

4969.139 --> 4974.0
I mean you don't have to shove it in

4970.699 --> 4976.659
people's face but just don't try to just

4974.0 --> 4976.659
deal with it

4977.0 --> 4982.58
right that's what I would do and I've

4980.3 --> 4985.6990000000005
met some I've had friends in the past

4982.58 --> 4988.4
that like grew bald very young like

4985.699 --> 4990.739
really like in their 20s and they were

4988.4 --> 4992.719
like really frustrated over that totally

4990.739 --> 4995.178999999999
get that

4992.719 --> 4997.88
it is frustrating especially when you're

4995.179 --> 4999.5
really young and you get it

4997.88 --> 5002.7390000000005
but

4999.5 --> 5004.84
like if you get older and you find a

5002.739 --> 5007.44
life mission then it just shouldn't be

5004.84 --> 5007.4400000000005
an obstacle

5007.54 --> 5012.4
right you're just gonna use your

5009.88 --> 5015.1
baldness as an excuse but I can't do it

5012.4 --> 5019.199
because I'm insecure then then you're

5015.1 --> 5019.1990000000005
using it as a crutch that's bad

5023.08 --> 5030.5199999999995
right oh and by the way a little factoid

5026.92 --> 5032.679
tip that I got from many women and that

5030.52 --> 5035.820000000001
is that there is like a whole category

5032.679 --> 5038.86
of women that actually find balding men

5035.82 --> 5040.659
sexually attractive

5038.86 --> 5043.0599999999995
yeah

5040.659 --> 5048.28
they're out there

5043.06 --> 5051.1
so you really shouldn't be too worried

5048.28 --> 5054.219
God provides right doesn't just make you

5051.1 --> 5057.04
like that just to [ __ ] you over

5054.219 --> 5059.94
