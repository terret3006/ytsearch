2.35 --> 10.82
good morning everyone

5.74 --> 11.509
welcome to flat earth early birds number

10.82 --> 17.119
11

11.509 --> 22.698999999999998
I'm your host Arwen and yeah

17.119 --> 25.789
I have no guests yet today the weather

22.699 --> 30.470000000000002
is really nice and bright but really

25.789 --> 34.85
really cold now like very seriously like

30.47 --> 38.8
cold as a knife in your skin so yeah if

34.85 --> 46.010000000000005
just it's not a good time to fall asleep

38.8 --> 50.54
drunk outside not that I would do that

46.01 --> 57.22
and then drink I'm up these days rarely

50.54 --> 60.22
happen for a while but yeah let's see

57.22 --> 64.03999999999999
can I talk about could do a bit of

60.22 --> 69.23
aftermath but yesterday yesterday was

64.04 --> 73.01
very heated didn't really feel good with

69.23 --> 77.18
me afterward so I'm worrying a bit about

73.01 --> 81.64
it just I don't like these kind of

77.18 --> 84.11000000000001
subjects for this show you know I guess

81.64 --> 88.85
there's a place and a time for

84.11 --> 92.62
everything and I think that place would

88.85 --> 95.36
be vegan guys hang outs because that guy

92.62 --> 99.89
doesn't give no [ __ ] and you can do

95.36 --> 104.27
anything in fights insane hardcore

99.89 --> 106.909
trolls so doesn't really matter to him

104.27 --> 109.64
there yeah you can do anything there but

106.909 --> 113.74000000000001
on this show I just this is supposed to

109.64 --> 117.799
be a morning breakfast show you don't

113.74 --> 119.72
get all hardcore on those because that's

117.799 --> 123.17
not something you want to wake up to and

119.72 --> 125.71
you don't want to wake up to disgusting

123.17 --> 130.79
things cuz you're usually eating

125.71 --> 136.76
breakfast as Jose was

130.79 --> 142.79899999999998
yeah clearly trying to signal to us so

136.76 --> 146.879
let's get that out of the way and just

142.799 --> 149.09900000000002
talk about more subtle things and well

146.879 --> 153.17
you know geopolitics can be very

149.099 --> 157.56
interesting but not if you're gonna

153.17 --> 161.27999999999997
insert insert such aggression into it

157.56 --> 163.73
and I generally don't like that they

161.28 --> 168.87
used to think like that like especially

163.73 --> 171.11999999999998
right as something really aggravating or

168.87 --> 173.4
painful happens that's typically the

171.12 --> 175.23000000000002
time that you especially if it's close

173.4 --> 180.26000000000002
to home that you would get more

175.23 --> 180.26
aggressive in this kind of field but

182.329 --> 191.93900000000002
it's better just not to do that and to

188.22 --> 201.949
get approach especially geopolitics much

191.939 --> 207.75
more refined it's kind of obvious just

201.949 --> 210.53
don't go radical and let [ __ ] hit the

207.75 --> 213.599
fan that's just never a good idea I

210.53 --> 216.659
explained it before typically when Wars

213.599 --> 220.16899999999998
start that's when all parties make their

216.659 --> 223.26
moves that they've prepared so it's a

220.169 --> 226.739
time of a lot of unpredictable actions

223.26 --> 228.41899999999998
it's never good there's a there's just a

226.739 --> 230.09900000000002
great likelihood that a lot of people

228.419 --> 232.43
are going to suffer including those that

230.099 --> 235.47
absolutely do not deserve it

232.43 --> 242.01000000000002
so you want to prevent that kind of

235.47 --> 244.019
thing even that means letting certain

242.01 --> 246.54
things that are slightly and justified

244.019 --> 248.94
or very and justify depending on the

246.54 --> 254.41899999999998
perspective of it and if that means not

248.94 --> 257.459
just immediately setting that straight

254.419 --> 261.479
I'd be more inclined to say okay build

257.459 --> 265.37
it down get yeah don't kick somebody out

261.479 --> 270.539
on the street make sure that they

265.37 --> 272.28000000000003
get ready for it and get help them get a

270.539 --> 276.9
plan as it were you know that's the

272.28 --> 280.13899999999995
difference I don't know maybe I'm just

276.9 --> 284.23999999999995
being big liberal or whatever I just

280.139 --> 285.449
think that it's just not a good thing

284.24 --> 288.3
ever

285.449 --> 291.90000000000003
you know like and yeah people that

288.3 --> 295.59000000000003
really do the nasty things sick people

291.9 --> 298.13899999999995
that give the orders to just bomb

295.59 --> 304.289
civilian targets and such yeah that

298.139 --> 306.569
deserves justice but even that doesn't

304.289 --> 309.99
mean like just straight out start

306.569 --> 313.8
bombing it back because it's better to

309.99 --> 318.3
just minimize the damage yes that should

313.8 --> 321.569
be always the reason to to do anything

318.3 --> 326.18
but just talk to like news of the future

321.569 --> 326.18
actions is always to prevent more damage

326.36 --> 335.699
that should be the trigger point that

331.199 --> 337.86
should be what puts military and Secret

335.699 --> 341.009
Service things into action to prevent

337.86 --> 345.779
damage that's what should be their

341.009 --> 350.219
primary function and we should try to

345.779 --> 355.8
think like that and push that more and

350.219 --> 358.529
more so they'll actually be more if you

355.8 --> 360.719
put more eyes on them and have a better

358.529 --> 364.5
clearer view of what their function is

360.719 --> 367.319
then so will they and they'll not just

364.5 --> 375.93
do whatever I don't know maybe I'm just

367.319 --> 378.28900000000004
over generalizing all these big scale

375.93 --> 378.289
things

380.139 --> 387.0
let's use in chat right

400.41 --> 408.93
yeah I and rent yeah I yeah I did some

405.84 --> 409.97999999999996
housekeeping in my community settings it

408.93 --> 416.82
was kind of a mess

409.98 --> 419.55
and yeah just unrest most people because

416.82 --> 422.43
didn't make any sense and I need to

419.55 --> 432.18
start anew so much time has passed and

422.43 --> 434.67
then just need to redo it and you know

432.18 --> 435.92
what these days I can pretty much handle

434.67 --> 439.40000000000003
it myself

435.92 --> 442.29
I'm used to it you know on the debates I

439.4 --> 446.0
always keep track of chat and I have the

442.29 --> 449.64000000000004
back chat and I have no problem just

446.0 --> 451.44
keeping an eye on the chat to see for if

449.64 --> 453.3
there's like really trolling activities

451.44 --> 457.08
and just taking care of it myself

453.3 --> 458.54
so yeah especially if I have some guests

457.08 --> 462.63
that are like talking with each other

458.54 --> 472.1
then I can take some time to the chat

462.63 --> 472.1
and to do some some moderating as well

472.79 --> 483.18
so right let's see who is inject from

481.26 --> 488.53999999999996
the beginning stopping traffic in my

483.18 --> 495.27
rest I hat Rowan Thorson Shane Walter

488.54 --> 499.55
Daniel field the legendary looming hyena

495.27 --> 506.47999999999996
2.0 goodie David really I do

499.55 --> 506.48
beamers Utes

510.889 --> 524.269
serious Michael O'Rourke shout Tibet

521.8 --> 530.779
Steven wetalk Wow

524.269 --> 533.99
no decent LaVon good morning I was the

530.779 --> 541.269
weather over there let me show you so

533.99 --> 541.269
little bit cheap laude what it's not bad

546.4 --> 558.25
a lot of leaves have pretty much now

548.89 --> 561.13
fallen most of them and my room late is

558.25 --> 565.51
moving and squabbling with their parents

561.13 --> 568.11
all the time being very stressed out in

565.51 --> 568.11
German

583.58 --> 596.1800000000001
so I'm getting not flattered through

594.29 --> 599.9499999999999
late just getting some new inspiration

596.18 --> 606.62
for D&D things that I could make

599.95 --> 608.57
basically more world-building funny

606.62 --> 613.16
thing is as I am making all these things

608.57 --> 618.44
I'm also building building blocks to

613.16 --> 623.329
approach what I can do as a game master

618.44 --> 626.7090000000001
more technically and just yeah define it

623.329 --> 631.0699999999999
solidify it in a certain structure that

626.709 --> 633.92
allows more technical building setups

631.07 --> 639.61
with it so you can really say okay this

633.92 --> 642.38
type of zones this type of magical rules

639.61 --> 646.519
okay yet there's so much possible and it

642.38 --> 650.26
is the D&D especially if you fully apply

646.519 --> 655.399
magic and deities stuff it is so heavy

650.26 --> 657.709
heavy fantasy magic stuff like really

655.399 --> 661.579
heavy like Lord of the Rings it's just

657.709 --> 665.959
cookie you know here like fireballs and

661.579 --> 668.8
lasers and weird ghosts and [ __ ] like

665.959 --> 671.8699999999999
fly all over the place in the B&B world

668.8 --> 673.76
although depends on what the game master

671.87 --> 675.5
wants you know you could leave

673.76 --> 679.1899999999999
everything out but if you just dig into

675.5 --> 683.05
what is and what has been designed it so

679.19 --> 685.61
incredibly fast it's just mind-boggling

683.05 --> 689.02
but yeah you can make any kind of story

685.61 --> 695.48
or world with that and I have very

689.02 --> 701.06
interesting world I think anyway dee dee

695.48 --> 704.0
hurry fantasy well flat although my

701.06 --> 707.709
players have just refused to accept that

704.0 --> 715.42
when I say it as a game a statement I

707.709 --> 715.42
stop saying man anyway

716.72 --> 719.9300000000001
what else

728.79 --> 737.16
yeah the Flat Earth debates haven't been

733.92 --> 741.5699999999999
very very active in their Lord you speak

737.16 --> 745.35
up sometimes because this show pretty

741.57 --> 748.35
much removes the daily need for me to

745.35 --> 755.7900000000001
just ramble on and have my attention so

748.35 --> 758.28
ray yeah I'm a human being too and but I

755.79 --> 765.6899999999999
think that the debates are going pretty

758.28 --> 770.5799999999999
well but I almost have to like give

765.69 --> 773.97
credit to this like the tenacity of the

770.58 --> 779.5500000000001
polar group because there are such

773.97 --> 783.5
failures and such down in the in the

779.55 --> 785.9399999999999
ditch in the dredge just completely in

783.5 --> 790.08
surrounded by filth and they just keep

785.94 --> 794.7600000000001
on going but it's become so easy now for

790.08 --> 797.13
our side even from a very mild careful

794.76 --> 801.27
approach just completely defeat them

797.13 --> 806.37
from every corner they've dug so many

801.27 --> 809.9399999999999
holes while not actually being prepared

806.37 --> 812.76
for the depth that they would have to

809.94 --> 818.19
reach in order to defend their delusion

812.76 --> 820.47
and in the same time we actually figure

818.19 --> 825.3000000000001
out what what it is what we're dealing

820.47 --> 829.58
with and increasing the depth of the

825.3 --> 832.29
details of our insight and they don't

829.58 --> 837.38
they just keep hanging on to their

832.29 --> 840.27
constructs on to their machinations and

837.38 --> 846.84
that is all they cared about and they

840.27 --> 849.84
just prevent recognizing legitimate

846.84 --> 853.5600000000001
structure and legitimate forms of

849.84 --> 856.08
reasoning they like flat earthers can

853.56 --> 858.5999999999999
think like globus but Globus can't

856.08 --> 862.32
actually think like flat earthers they

858.6 --> 864.4200000000001
can talk like them yeah hey you

862.32 --> 867.63
a lot of globus tend to be people that

864.42 --> 870.6899999999999
are very good at learning stuff by heart

867.63 --> 873.0
so yeah ever good at school so they will

870.69 --> 875.5500000000001
eventually be able to mimic us but they

873.0 --> 877.32
still won't get it they just will do say

875.55 --> 879.7199999999999
it like it's all meaningless and in

877.32 --> 881.58
their mind it is meaningless cause they

879.72 --> 884.3100000000001
just can't see what we're talking about

881.58 --> 886.64
because it's blocked in their mind cuz

884.31 --> 892.1999999999999
they're religious fanatics they can only

886.64 --> 897.36
think through their conception of how it

892.2 --> 899.09
should be I did that too you know at a

897.36 --> 902.91
time I was 12

899.09 --> 906.33
yeah some people grow over that kind of

902.91 --> 910.26
mindset or they get seriously confronted

906.33 --> 912.39
by friends family telling them like yet

910.26 --> 917.36
this is just getting so annoying maybe

912.39 --> 922.38
you should cut it down and just relax I

917.36 --> 924.75
don't know maybe these ballers do have

922.38 --> 927.54
normal no no they don't have normal life

924.75 --> 930.36
I refuse to believe that can't spend

927.54 --> 940.9399999999999
this much time here have a normal life

930.36 --> 940.94
nope sorry anyway it's a crazy world

942.38 --> 951.45
what's this happening what's the

946.08 --> 955.32
developments lots of people waking up in

951.45 --> 959.24
different ways that's the funny thing

955.32 --> 963.57
waking up in different ways it's funny

959.24 --> 967.59
it's like in every field there are holes

963.57 --> 971.22
there are autocratic structures there's

967.59 --> 972.69
like moral pollution pretty much

971.22 --> 975.36
everywhere and there's a lot of people

972.69 --> 979.5300000000001
just figuring that out in their region

975.36 --> 985.2
and this use this kind of already

979.53 --> 989.8199999999999
happened earlier like 10 years ago but

985.2 --> 991.8000000000001
now more yeah those were the like the hi

989.82 --> 994.8000000000001
Enders the people that really are

991.8 --> 996.06
ambitious they figured it out first but

994.8 --> 999.15
even the

996.06 --> 1000.89
more basic people that are not that

999.15 --> 1003.0799999999999
ambitious that are just doing their jobs

1000.89 --> 1007.0
even they are now starting to slowly

1003.08 --> 1010.19
figure out what's wrong you know not

1007.0 --> 1011.75
necessarily like Julianne flat earth but

1010.19 --> 1013.46
just like oh yeah that there aren't

1011.75 --> 1015.05
definitely things wrong in a medical

1013.46 --> 1017.96
system this and that is completely

1015.05 --> 1022.3399999999999
ridiculous this policy or this director

1017.96 --> 1026.27
is just an idiot or figuring out that

1022.34 --> 1029.93
politics really why it's not just always

1026.27 --> 1032.45
bad but just and getting to understand

1029.93 --> 1034.16
the symptoms of what's going on so many

1032.45 --> 1037.55
people are waking up in different

1034.16 --> 1043.3300000000002
regions and it's a really good thing

1037.55 --> 1043.33
it's necessary absolutely necessary and

1044.14 --> 1049.5800000000002
it gives good promise for the future

1046.76 --> 1055.16
because it means that more people will

1049.58 --> 1059.4499999999998
become eventually available to just be

1055.16 --> 1061.93
part of the thinking world on the

1059.45 --> 1061.93
interview

1065.55 --> 1074.49
oops so maybe overly optimistic you know

1070.06 --> 1076.51
people go forward and on the same time

1074.49 --> 1078.94
when [ __ ] hits the fan

1076.51 --> 1081.28
they also regress a lot of people do

1078.94 --> 1086.14
they've become more basic they give up

1081.28 --> 1089.1399999999999
hopes for certain things they go for

1086.14 --> 1091.96
short routes decisions because things

1089.14 --> 1095.3200000000002
are destabilizing or just feel like they

1091.96 --> 1098.8
need to escape so yeah it could all just

1095.32 --> 1102.61
switch around but currently I'm meeting

1098.8 --> 1106.6
so many people that are just figuring

1102.61 --> 1109.84
out more and more and I can just hear

1106.6 --> 1115.1399999999999
that their minds are gradually

1109.84 --> 1117.8799999999999
sharpening yeah I listen a lot you know

1115.14 --> 1119.5300000000002
now oh my gosh you know me always like

1117.88 --> 1122.2900000000002
okay I'm talking and interacting like

1119.53 --> 1126.43
getting involved in public I don't do

1122.29 --> 1129.3999999999999
that as much sometimes when I really

1126.43 --> 1131.74
feel like somebody is yeah wanting to

1129.4 --> 1134.1100000000001
have conversation sure I'll do it but

1131.74 --> 1135.88
mostly I just said somewhere just

1134.11 --> 1140.5
chilling and looking around and

1135.88 --> 1142.9
listening and not staring at people so

1140.5 --> 1145.42
but I can still follow a lot of what's

1142.9 --> 1147.8500000000001
going on and just analyze their voice

1145.42 --> 1151.8700000000001
what they're trying to bring across and

1147.85 --> 1157.54
just size them up it's fit yeah it's a

1151.87 --> 1161.25
hobby and you learn a lot when you do

1157.54 --> 1161.25
that a lot so

1163.84 --> 1172.4089999999999
anyway also helps me a bit my hopes for

1169.929 --> 1175.419
Humanity I'm not really that s mystic

1172.409 --> 1179.3500000000001
although I can imagine that this is

1175.419 --> 1183.8090000000002
relatively a good region in the world to

1179.35 --> 1187.9599999999998
be optimistic about human about humanity

1183.809 --> 1198.1589999999999
despite the politics which are just

1187.96 --> 1207.0
atrocious let's see so what are you

1198.159 --> 1214.95
gonna join me so I'm here I don't mind

1207.0 --> 1214.95
but you really don't need to be shy or

1215.039 --> 1219.85
intimidated or whatever of the scope

1217.39 --> 1223.75
that I'm trying to grasp down don't be

1219.85 --> 1227.98
hypnotized just hey Jose thank you for

1223.75 --> 1229.779
joining you're welcome yeah I go mio doc

1231.789 --> 1238.649
chime in happy right it's okay

1234.58 --> 1238.649
have a good breakfast thank you

1251.73 --> 1255.029
[Music]

1262.69 --> 1265.56
I don't know

1267.01 --> 1271.66
I have so much to talk about but not

1269.29 --> 1277.12
really it's more like ever lot to think

1271.66 --> 1283.3600000000001
about nothing don't really have a story

1277.12 --> 1289.35
context to explain it yet but I think a

1283.36 --> 1293.8
lot about like periods waves of energy

1289.35 --> 1295.98
where people become active it is one of

1293.8 --> 1299.83
these effects for example it's like the

1295.98 --> 1302.98
especially during spring and summer the

1299.83 --> 1305.59
morning glory' general right before the

1302.98 --> 1308.02
Sun comes up there is many I think it's

1305.59 --> 1311.86
even measurable but definitely feasible

1308.02 --> 1314.95
if you're outside there even inside

1311.86 --> 1318.7299999999998
there's like this weird tremor like a

1314.95 --> 1321.3400000000001
wave of energy and it's quite

1318.73 --> 1326.29
fascinating to consciously experience

1321.34 --> 1331.33
that and can be inspiring depending on

1326.29 --> 1333.19
your mood and I think that there's all

1331.33 --> 1337.75
kinds of these things I think there are

1333.19 --> 1341.23
periods where suddenly I don't know

1337.75 --> 1344.92
things change and then everybody's mood

1341.23 --> 1349.96
just swings gradually or suddenly or

1344.92 --> 1351.8200000000002
just after a certain time and there's

1349.96 --> 1355.06
other periods also where certainly just

1351.82 --> 1357.97
all the people die of old age like the

1355.06 --> 1359.83
old folks suddenly start dropping like

1357.97 --> 1364.42
in a short time this kind of thing

1359.83 --> 1369.1899999999998
happens it is weird but it is

1364.42 --> 1371.3500000000001
fascinating that it at least appears to

1369.19 --> 1376.74
work that way and just makes me feel

1371.35 --> 1376.74
like yep how much of us is really a

1377.13 --> 1383.0500000000002
stable program and core that just

1380.17 --> 1386.77
functions the way it is programmed and

1383.05 --> 1389.3799999999999
how much is influenced from energy from

1386.77 --> 1392.1
the outside even natural energies

1389.38 --> 1399.43
natural natural energy cycles but

1392.1 --> 1400.84
potentially also unnatural man-made yeah

1399.43 --> 1404.47
man-made things have in

1400.84 --> 1408.34
humans what do you think about if

1404.47 --> 1411.309
they're a different mentality on people

1408.34 --> 1413.8899999999999
that are born and raised in a big theory

1411.309 --> 1417.4289999999999
where there is no mountains and trees

1413.89 --> 1420.159
and forests and rivers versus people

1417.429 --> 1423.13
that are born more in the in the world

1420.159 --> 1425.38
Ernest you know in a country series on

1423.13 --> 1427.5390000000002
forests and rivers and dealing with the

1425.38 --> 1429.0390000000002
dirt and the water and then when they

1427.539 --> 1431.14
grow up I think the mentality is

1429.039 --> 1433.39
different even if they are educated in

1431.14 --> 1438.64
the things if they write that not just

1433.39 --> 1441.94
the mentality it's it all depends on

1438.64 --> 1444.789
where you literally grow up and if

1441.94 --> 1448.8400000000001
there's a lot of City stuff around you

1444.789 --> 1452.529
then yeah you're you will grow in a

1448.84 --> 1454.6299999999999
different way your your mind your focus

1452.529 --> 1457.779
will grow in a different way as when you

1454.63 --> 1459.7
are when you have time and open space

1457.779 --> 1461.26
and then it probably as a kid you

1459.7 --> 1463.779
wouldn't appreciate it because it's kind

1461.26 --> 1464.529
of boring maybe or maybe you learn to

1463.779 --> 1469.419
appreciate it

1464.529 --> 1474.73
but just having big stuff around you it

1469.419 --> 1476.529
just it migrates your focus and if you

1474.73 --> 1478.71
have gone through that during that

1476.529 --> 1482.77
growth period that stays with you and

1478.71 --> 1485.08
that allows the way you approach things

1482.77 --> 1487.21
and construct things in your mind also

1485.08 --> 1490.049
to be different while people that grow

1487.21 --> 1494.3500000000001
up in cities they you should usually

1490.049 --> 1498.1299999999999
emphasize and focus more on being quick

1494.35 --> 1501.1899999999998
things really quick out waiting people

1498.13 --> 1504.75
being really fast at things and being

1501.19 --> 1507.3990000000001
very dynamic and quick because that is

1504.75 --> 1509.23
like what they'll be confronted with

1507.399 --> 1512.02
very early on and that's like you have

1509.23 --> 1515.26
to grow with that to get better at

1512.02 --> 1518.23
things so that becomes the way they

1515.26 --> 1520.51
develop and you can see just add if it's

1518.23 --> 1524.44
a cultural mentality what's also just

1520.51 --> 1530.53
how their mind works best what they're

1524.44 --> 1534.3400000000001
best at so does that answer yeah

1530.53 --> 1537.039
excellent yeah I me personally

1534.34 --> 1542.26
I am the youngest I got two brothers and

1537.039 --> 1544.87
two sisters and we were so I am more

1542.26 --> 1545.3799999999999
born and raised in a CD type of thing

1544.87 --> 1548.83
you know

1545.38 --> 1550.99
both my my dad's brother my uncle he

1548.83 --> 1553.059
lives in the mountain really high and

1550.99 --> 1555.88
they live all school they got the

1553.059 --> 1558.22
outside kitchen they raise porks and

1555.88 --> 1560.169
goats and they eat they they cultivate

1558.22 --> 1562.6000000000001
their own food and stuff you know so

1560.169 --> 1565.3600000000001
when I had the choice when I was like 10

1562.6 --> 1566.74
years old my parents asked me like a you

1565.36 --> 1568.6589999999999
want to stay with your own cost for your

1566.74 --> 1571.419
summertime you know vacation from school

1568.659 --> 1573.909
I said like yeah I'll stay a few days we

1571.419 --> 1576.159
used to go visit a lot and a few days

1573.909 --> 1577.779
became when they went to pick me up they

1576.159 --> 1579.3400000000001
left me like a week and they said like

1577.779 --> 1581.74
I'm sorry we couldn't come to pick you

1579.34 --> 1584.74
up and I said like no I mean I'll stay

1581.74 --> 1586.33
yeah I'll like it over here and my uncle

1584.74 --> 1588.19
helped me wake him wake me up like a

1586.33 --> 1591.1899999999998
four five in the morning to go collect

1588.19 --> 1593.5
wood to cook the next day to collect the

1591.19 --> 1595.51
food for the forks and it was such a

1593.5 --> 1597.61
different life because even though we

1595.51 --> 1599.47
didn't have technology by then when I

1597.61 --> 1602.9499999999998
was saying we didn't have the cellphones

1599.47 --> 1605.169
computers nothing you know so we still

1602.95 --> 1607.809
had to go out and play with the with the

1605.169 --> 1609.73
kids versus my uncles it was like that

1607.809 --> 1611.26
house in the middle of nowhere so we

1609.73 --> 1613.419
used to hang out and play in the woods

1611.26 --> 1616.51
with dirt and rocks and the rivers and

1613.419 --> 1619.0590000000002
stuff you know and from then on until I

1616.51 --> 1622.24
turn until I finished high school every

1619.059 --> 1623.95
single summer I stayed in my uncle the

1622.24 --> 1626.77
whole month and a half of summer time

1623.95 --> 1629.47
and I loved it bro I love the life yeah

1626.77 --> 1632.71
big time I love it and I miss it

1629.47 --> 1635.95
miss it a lot man yeah I I had my share

1632.71 --> 1638.049
of something like that not at mountains

1635.95 --> 1640.45
and I wasn't that lucky but my

1638.049 --> 1642.97
grandmother had like a farm pretty big

1640.45 --> 1646.47
farm were like right next to a basic

1642.97 --> 1649.09
course it's like in polar landscape in

1646.47 --> 1652.179
Friesland in the north of the

1649.09 --> 1655.57
Netherlands it was sold now but yeah and

1652.179 --> 1658.0590000000002
there we did like wood cutting work oh

1655.57 --> 1661.0
it's like garden work stuff but it's

1658.059 --> 1663.1589999999999
really big garden and fire fire in the

1661.0 --> 1665.71
garden I loved them and there was always

1663.159 --> 1667.75
with my with my cousins

1665.71 --> 1674.58
everybody was always there

1667.75 --> 1674.58
I love that so much yeah good old days

1679.29 --> 1682.77
go join over here I see somebody that's

1681.0 --> 1688.049
Dan with you hmm

1682.77 --> 1691.71
hello Dan good morning hey good morning

1688.049 --> 1695.76
sorry I'm just having breakfast I'll

1691.71 --> 1697.679
just make myself alright thank team but

1695.76 --> 1699.09
I heard they coming what I was talking

1697.679 --> 1701.22
about and he hit me a little bit so I

1699.09 --> 1703.35
had to come in you know yeah he's good

1701.22 --> 1705.51
you know to have those memories when you

1703.35 --> 1707.79
when you have to deal with nature you

1705.51 --> 1710.01
know and we don't see that a lot anymore

1707.79 --> 1712.77
is just because technology have taken

1710.01 --> 1715.62
over our thoughts our mentality you know

1712.77 --> 1717.99
everybody even we like it or not even if

1715.62 --> 1719.6399999999999
we don't watch TV we got the cell phones

1717.99 --> 1720.929
we got computers because we talking to

1719.64 --> 1722.73
each other through technology you know

1720.929 --> 1730.0800000000002
so if yeah it's a totally different

1722.73 --> 1734.1
times we living in there yeah man I like

1730.08 --> 1735.99
the feeling why's the best memories that

1734.1 --> 1741.48
I have when it was really young like

1735.99 --> 1743.429
between 6 12 was when I went to that

1741.48 --> 1746.19
farm and we do I would do with my

1743.429 --> 1749.21
cousins everybody was young like her

1746.19 --> 1752.6100000000001
brother was like a teenager pretty much

1749.21 --> 1755.0900000000001
but yeah he would be spending time with

1752.61 --> 1758.4289999999999
other things but yeah me and my cousins

1755.09 --> 1762.78
and we would just go out adventure just

1758.429 --> 1770.19
start at the farm and then like try to

1762.78 --> 1773.61
follow like like small rivers go

1770.19 --> 1776.5800000000002
underneath bridges and just adventure to

1773.61 --> 1781.8899999999999
places that we didn't know that was so

1776.58 --> 1783.57
freakin amazing awesome and the kids of

1781.89 --> 1785.1000000000001
today don't leave that because they

1783.57 --> 1787.1689999999999
leave that through a video game or a

1785.1 --> 1789.33
computer you know exploring their wards

1787.169 --> 1791.25
in the freaking video games no you have

1789.33 --> 1793.53
to go out I don't yeah there's nothing

1791.25 --> 1796.26
like the real thing with real risk like

1793.53 --> 1799.2
really trying to get across a certain

1796.26 --> 1802.14
spot you have to jump over water and

1799.2 --> 1804.299
[ __ ] and like accidents could happen and

1802.14 --> 1807.929
they did sometimes happen oh yeah and

1804.299 --> 1810.33
then we would have Angry parents but man

1807.929 --> 1813.68
that was freaking amazing there's

1810.33 --> 1819.0
nothing like real fresh

1813.68 --> 1823.28
exploration into unknown territory love

1819.0 --> 1823.28
it love it yeah

1829.09 --> 1835.029
oh yeah having a little sandwich over

1833.379 --> 1839.6999999999998
here ham and cheese

1835.029 --> 1845.549
good ol sandwich nice yeah

1839.7 --> 1852.3700000000001
probably get some baked eggs after this

1845.549 --> 1854.35
day yeah make eggs yeah

1852.37 --> 1859.059
flight conferences are pretty good in

1854.35 --> 1863.83
the footage I saw the Flat Earth [ __ ]

1859.059 --> 1865.9189999999999
videos they're pretty cool I didn't see

1863.83 --> 1865.9189999999999
it

1866.009 --> 1872.95
yeah yeah I'll probably see some of it

1869.519 --> 1878.08
he was walking around speaking to people

1872.95 --> 1880.3300000000002
and go into bars late at night flat

1878.08 --> 1889.629
smacking people it's kind kind of

1880.33 --> 1897.279
dangerous to do in Denver people aren't

1889.629 --> 1901.4189999999999
like crazy there what is crazy

1897.279 --> 1907.86
everywhere pretty decent right they're

1901.419 --> 1911.19
decent folk I think Bob's from Denver

1907.86 --> 1911.1899999999998
what's his name

1912.389 --> 1917.08
you know what I was talking about last

1914.529 --> 1919.269
night with a co-worker of mine whenever

1917.08 --> 1921.789
we sit outside because I'm only been

1919.269 --> 1924.129
here for I think two months now two

1921.789 --> 1926.139
months and a week in Texas from Florida

1924.129 --> 1929.98
and it's a totally different because

1926.139 --> 1931.9599999999998
Florida is very busy as a touristic area

1929.98 --> 1935.049
a lot of rich people live there the

1931.96 --> 1937.6000000000001
beach and hotels and a lot of touristic

1935.049 --> 1939.61
you know traffic over here is more of an

1937.6 --> 1941.4699999999998
old-school country type of place you

1939.61 --> 1945.2489999999998
know in the middle of nowhere and it's

1941.47 --> 1947.1100000000001
an older area what I did so they've been

1945.249 --> 1948.73
maybe ten years ago is where they got

1947.11 --> 1952.1789999999999
the street lights for the first time you

1948.73 --> 1954.19
know and some of the big businesses and

1952.179 --> 1957.279
I realized the people over here is

1954.19 --> 1960.22
really polite really nice in Clearwater

1957.279 --> 1962.08
Florida I found a lot of like black

1960.22 --> 1962.82
people and black community we have

1962.08 --> 1964.62
anything

1962.82 --> 1966.269
wrong with them they were so good over

1964.62 --> 1967.9799999999998
there and they had that that greeting

1966.269 --> 1970.259
and the sagging in depends on the yellow

1967.98 --> 1973.409
and their gang signs and they're really

1970.259 --> 1975.659
ghetto Todd over here totally different

1973.409 --> 1976.919
they just like blend in like normal

1975.659 --> 1979.5
people you know they have extra skin

1976.919 --> 1981.929
color but the behavior is so different

1979.5 --> 1985.289
maybe I mean I say because of the

1981.929 --> 1987.8090000000002
country or how all the culture is but

1985.289 --> 1991.3799999999999
yeah it's mind blowing to everybody I

1987.809 --> 1993.6299999999999
mean over there I could maybe just read

1991.38 --> 1995.94
people by just looking at him by the

1993.63 --> 1998.5490000000002
skin color but the way they dress but

1995.94 --> 2000.8600000000001
over here not at all because everybody

1998.549 --> 2003.23
with totally different skin color and

2000.86 --> 2005.5089999999998
different clothes there are so polite

2003.23 --> 2007.6390000000001
and so nice I like it over here a lot

2005.509 --> 2011.1200000000001
many in this area in Texas it sounds

2007.639 --> 2013.399
very nice yeah even though 20 minutes

2011.12 --> 2015.0189999999998
from here is Houston Texas I think that

2013.399 --> 2016.9089999999999
Patricia's theories from there or

2015.019 --> 2019.94
something like that over there is a lot

2016.909 --> 2022.8790000000001
of more of criminal activity and get or

2019.94 --> 2025.669
whatever so just 20 minutes away in a in

2022.879 --> 2029.75
a in a part of the world so totally

2025.669 --> 2032.029
different so yeah I I take this area in

2029.75 --> 2033.86
the middle of nowhere then Houston in

2032.029 --> 2036.919
the theory you know with with all the

2033.86 --> 2047.74
activity you know any day Houston has a

2036.919 --> 2047.74
problem but I got a face reference just

2049.659 --> 2056.149
yeah that's nice to hear that's not

2052.099 --> 2061.6290000000004
everybody's like that okay to be honest

2056.149 --> 2061.629
I really hate that stuff

2066.2 --> 2070.7
I'd over there also in in other places

2068.78 --> 2072.619
in Florida people just read me by the

2070.7 --> 2073.9399999999996
way I love because I just look Spanish

2072.619 --> 2076.07
because of the color of my skin or

2073.94 --> 2078.02
whatever and I got a Puerto Rico hat or

2076.07 --> 2079.849
whatever them people just think you know

2078.02 --> 2084.32
because I'm Spanish whatever you know

2079.849 --> 2087.56
people just think just target somebody

2084.32 --> 2090.02
for whatever race you are you know and I

2087.56 --> 2091.82
hated that over here everybody is blend

2090.02 --> 2094.28
in everybody's the same it's actually a

2091.82 --> 2097.04
lot of big Mexican community being so

2094.28 --> 2098.75
close so close to Mexico so yeah it's

2097.04 --> 2103.7599999999998
cool it's a lot of spanish-speaking over

2098.75 --> 2107.06
here what what city were you well it's

2103.76 --> 2109.3100000000004
in Texas Alvin Texas City

2107.06 --> 2110.69
Alvin like Alvin and the Chipmunks oh

2109.31 --> 2113.359
really elves in here

2110.69 --> 2119.48
Alvin yep yeah a little yeah a little

2113.359 --> 2121.52
bit to the south of of Houston okay so

2119.48 --> 2123.7400000000002
everywhere they speak Spanish everywhere

2121.52 --> 2126.2
everybody speak Spanish I don't know

2123.74 --> 2128.24
babe yeah because i saving be so close

2126.2 --> 2130.2799999999997
to mexico it's kind of a front right

2128.24 --> 2135.31
yeah a few hours away but a lot of

2130.28 --> 2135.3100000000004
people in texas speak spanish so

2151.83 --> 2159.88
it's anything else what does he think of

2155.92 --> 2161.8
mark leaving the show right right yeah

2159.88 --> 2165.9300000000003
we talked about that a bit yesterday

2161.8 --> 2173.05
Nathan's also but also on this show and

2165.93 --> 2176.0499999999997
yeah I think that he did he did right

2173.05 --> 2177.25
he should have like with his what he's

2176.05 --> 2181.9300000000003
trying to accomplish

2177.25 --> 2184.27
yes like he hates that guy and it's

2181.93 --> 2186.49
ridicu in my opinion - it's kind of

2184.27 --> 2190.869
ridiculous that he would be a mystery

2186.49 --> 2196.0
VIP guest it's like totally out of place

2190.869 --> 2203.26
it's just that judgment and yeah it is

2196.0 --> 2211.33
what it is yeah I don't know why he kept

2203.26 --> 2213.6090000000004
it quiet strange I smarter say himself

2211.33 --> 2215.68
they could have told him like yeah he's

2213.609 --> 2217.869
a mystery guest but he's a big Internet

2215.68 --> 2220.1189999999997
figure it's not like it's a big if big

2217.869 --> 2225.67
Hollywood movie figure or he's a big

2220.119 --> 2232.15
music figure that Vsauce let's get him

2225.67 --> 2239.859
as if he actually you know what was he

2232.15 --> 2240.7000000000003
that no but just imagine he would never

2239.859 --> 2246.4
come my way

2240.7 --> 2249.22
yeah it was maybe two or three weeks ago

2246.4 --> 2251.109
in Globe posters the Bob not all on the

2249.22 --> 2254.83
guys were talking about like yeah he's

2251.109 --> 2256.2999999999997
gonna be a guest celebrity over there he

2254.83 --> 2259.0299999999997
say I don't know who he is but it

2256.3 --> 2262.1800000000003
telling me is a big figure the way Bob

2259.03 --> 2263.8590000000004
described they they guess the way they

2262.18 --> 2265.4199999999996
told Bob that he said this is what I

2263.859 --> 2267.91
know this is what they told me it's a

2265.42 --> 2269.92
big figure I looked up to him we seen

2267.91 --> 2274.0299999999997
him in everywhere you know we recognize

2269.92 --> 2275.65
him I know so I was thinking like he

2274.03 --> 2278.71
talking about like freakin William

2275.65 --> 2280.839
Shatner like like Al Pacino like some

2278.71 --> 2284.41
big figure I was thinking like holy [ __ ]

2280.839 --> 2286.66
this is just getting real now like

2284.41 --> 2289.1499999999996
yeah I thought it was for real William

2286.66 --> 2295.8089999999997
Shatner like that was the only one that

2289.15 --> 2297.309
we all know you know cause we seen the

2295.809 --> 2299.619
videos on William Shatner he's like

2297.309 --> 2302.1400000000003
that's how you fix you you know it's

2299.619 --> 2304.509
awesome you know he's a thinker even if

2302.14 --> 2307.96

2304.509 --> 2309.46
freakin awesome if we got it fill

2307.96 --> 2312.819
everything I got damn there's the real

2309.46 --> 2315.759

2312.819 --> 2318.279
kids or subscribers just making immature

2315.759 --> 2321.309
ass shouting yet he's an immature

2318.279 --> 2325.269
[ __ ] and borderline sociopath

2321.309 --> 2328.3190000000004
probably yeah that's right if we got

2325.269 --> 2332.589
more subscribers forget into the event

2328.319 --> 2337.38
yeah good for everybody just try and get

2332.589 --> 2341.65
subscribers yeah he was soul harvesting

2337.38 --> 2344.98
it's just like I want more why'd you see

2341.65 --> 2349.539
that my ADC did you see that hot girl

2344.98 --> 2352.779
here at the conference and what yeah he

2349.539 --> 2355.69
met a girl at the conference and we're

2352.779 --> 2361.96
on a date and everything okay really

2355.69 --> 2363.4900000000002
yeah yeah she's pretty hot like well

2361.96 --> 2367.319
I've never seen her before ever

2363.49 --> 2371.5
for like really good-looking woman huh

2367.319 --> 2373.63
right well if we never seen her before

2371.5 --> 2376.0
him I know he's so weird

2373.63 --> 2378.759
oh it's really weird oh yes there's a

2376.0 --> 2380.98
girl and she was just a flat earther or

2378.759 --> 2383.619
I don't know what he's heard of her

2380.98 --> 2386.319
before that could just be an actor yeah

2383.619 --> 2389.7690000000002
it could be just came out of the

2386.319 --> 2396.009
woodwork from nowhere there's a video of

2389.769 --> 2397.72
her and him together it's that sense I

2396.009 --> 2399.73
don't know unless somebody could

2397.72 --> 2402.819
identify her that would be interesting

2399.73 --> 2404.109
yeah I would be very interesting unless

2402.819 --> 2405.369
she was just somebody that heard a

2404.109 --> 2409.38
celebrity was going to one of these

2405.369 --> 2409.38
things just turned up

2415.62 --> 2421.39
but yeah IPS was live streaming from the

2418.48 --> 2425.5
event I think he got into some argument

2421.39 --> 2430.42
as somebody wait who

2425.5 --> 2436.33
IPS oh is he still at it yes it was

2430.42 --> 2440.4700000000003
there Matt Mike's rocket I'm doing some

2436.33 --> 2442.89
live streaming and is you know anti Flat

2440.47 --> 2445.8999999999996
Earth or he doesn't talk about it or

2442.89 --> 2447.79
never happened what's going on I don't

2445.9 --> 2449.17
know he just went off the radar didn't

2447.79 --> 2455.5
think for a while I don't know exactly

2449.17 --> 2457.9900000000002
why I used to follow him before a lot

2455.5 --> 2460.69
and then I stopped watching here I think

2457.99 --> 2462.16
his channel didn't take him down and I

2460.69 --> 2464.65
stopped watching him for a while then I

2462.16 --> 2466.39
I heard the news like oh he's a global

2464.65 --> 2469.9300000000003
he was trolling he made a book and he

2466.39 --> 2471.5499999999997
whatever he say he was just an aging

2469.93 --> 2475.12
just looking for a story or whatever

2471.55 --> 2477.4300000000003
bushi so maybe a few weeks after I got

2475.12 --> 2479.71
to talk to him in one of his discord or

2477.43 --> 2481.8999999999996
whatever he said like yeah it's all true

2479.71 --> 2483.7
but I still I'm still question I mean I

2481.9 --> 2485.6800000000003
think they still the ISS and the space

2483.7 --> 2487.4199999999996
is [ __ ] and I still gonna keep

2485.68 --> 2489.3999999999996
pushing you know then I read you keep

2487.42 --> 2491.05
pushing like but it is fake we gotta

2489.4 --> 2493.27
take down NASA that's kind of his

2491.05 --> 2496.9300000000003
objective trust from his point of view

2493.27 --> 2500.77
you know you say the ISIS is or [ __ ]

2496.93 --> 2504.0099999999998
and NASA is full of [ __ ] and I I stopped

2500.77 --> 2506.67
hearing him but every maybe two weeks

2504.01 --> 2509.23
ago he had a short video and he was

2506.67 --> 2512.92
talking about the same just talking pro

2509.23 --> 2515.29
no pro fluttered but against the space

2512.92 --> 2516.9700000000003
agencies and the government so yeah he's

2515.29 --> 2519.58
all right in my book if he's trying to

2516.97 --> 2520.06
attack the deceivers sounds okay in my

2519.58 --> 2522.7599999999998
book

2520.06 --> 2526.6
I'll argue it's kind of hilarious so

2522.76 --> 2529.57
like the globus it's okay to them to

2526.6 --> 2533.35
just abort space fantasy as long as they

2529.57 --> 2536.8
can keep their globe it's like yeah you

2533.35 --> 2540.58
prefer to live in a globe in in nowhere

2536.8 --> 2543.69
in a cage and then said then to say

2540.58 --> 2545.25
goodbye to the actual globe that's just

2543.69 --> 2548.91
that globe

2545.25 --> 2551.31
tenacious men like people have will

2548.91 --> 2560.85
believe anything as long as hits on the

2551.31 --> 2565.4
freaking globe crazy but yeah

2560.85 --> 2569.85
interesting to hear that IPS is still

2565.4 --> 2571.89
against NASA and everything yeah I love

2569.85 --> 2573.99
I love the attention to him when he

2571.89 --> 2578.16
start with the drama with mdtv and all

2573.99 --> 2581.1299999999997
that personal [ __ ] that's what separated

2578.16 --> 2583.5899999999997
me of interest having interest on what

2581.13 --> 2587.1
he had is to say you know yes yeah

2583.59 --> 2590.67
personal to [ __ ] I know yeah I can't

2587.1 --> 2598.71
stand that [ __ ] and he's full of that so

2590.67 --> 2601.56
I don't follow him at all but funny to

2598.71 --> 2603.96
hear that he's still anti space and anti

2601.56 --> 2612.72
NASA doing things out there with his

2603.96 --> 2614.46
globe now apparently goodie right so

2612.72 --> 2621.87
we've got 15 more minutes to do

2614.46 --> 2625.2
something do you what Nathan this show

2621.87 --> 2631.3199999999997
is gonna be about does he know ever tell

2625.2 --> 2635.16
you like I've all depends in if there's

2631.32 --> 2638.78
something coming up housekeeping survey

2635.16 --> 2638.7799999999997
- usually

2642.76 --> 2648.94
yeah those shows are impromptu you know

2645.82 --> 2650.56
you improvise as we go yesterday for

2648.94 --> 2652.96
example there was a I think the

2650.56 --> 2654.79
Whisperer title because the day before

2652.96 --> 2657.099
there was a global and we heard the

2654.79 --> 2660.609
whisper or whatever so defense if

2657.099 --> 2662.71
there's like the Miles Davis thing so

2660.609 --> 2665.0499999999997
they put a title related they had a plan

2662.71 --> 2669.67
on talking about it but if not it's just

2665.05 --> 2672.13
a normal generic title and let the show

2669.67 --> 2674.9700000000003
progress you see what it takes us yeah

2672.13 --> 2674.9700000000003
sounds good

2683.98 --> 2693.41
yeah I mean what do you think the I mean

2688.1 --> 2695.36
Flat Earth [ __ ] and let us all that

2693.41 --> 2704.5099999999998
stuff it's like these names are pretty

2695.36 --> 2708.7400000000002
bad but I think their names are mostly

2704.51 --> 2711.2000000000003
just attention grabby and they put

2708.74 --> 2716.27
themselves in a certain level of being

2711.2 --> 2721.0
noisy and I think it probably fits their

2716.27 --> 2723.52
character and what they like more well

2721.0 --> 2726.41
you know everyone has their own

2723.52 --> 2728.87
frequency of what how they like to do

2726.41 --> 2732.8599999999997
things and how they like to approach

2728.87 --> 2735.02
things and the heaviness of the subjects

2732.86 --> 2743.48
where they like to go and everybody has

2735.02 --> 2746.18
their own level really go full in insane

2743.48 --> 2755.57
and other likes to keep it really really

2746.18 --> 2759.5
tidy yeah I had this YouTube created for

2755.57 --> 2762.38
many years maybe 10 years or so and but

2759.5 --> 2764.6
I had no subscribers or nothing I used

2762.38 --> 2767.3900000000003

2764.6 --> 2770.24

not too cloudy because it's cloudy today

3103.96 --> 3110.7400000000002
then I go out to take some foolish with

3107.47 --> 3113.6499999999996
the p900 I spotted a nice little spot in

3110.74 --> 3116.1099999999997
the Google Maps to to do some

3113.65 --> 3119.5
observations last time I went and I

3116.11 --> 3122.2000000000003
caught a building which is 17 something

3119.5 --> 3124.78
miles away is a 10 story building and I

3122.2 --> 3127.12
caught it and put a little video now if

3124.78 --> 3130.15
I go to this part that building will be

3127.12 --> 3132.7
28 miles away and I want to see if I

3130.15 --> 3135.52
gonna be able to see a 10 story building

3132.7 --> 3137.56
from 28 miles away that would be really

3135.52 --> 3140.56
interesting it's like a little piece of

3137.56 --> 3141.91
of island in between but it's not too

3140.56 --> 3143.92
high so the building shouldn't be

3141.91 --> 3147.0699999999997
obstructed the whole thing by del by the

3143.92 --> 3149.35
little island in between so yeah I'm

3147.07 --> 3152.53
looking forward to the observation

3149.35 --> 3155.2599999999998
emails you say seventeen point three

3152.53 --> 3155.77
miles I got their footage of a ten story

3155.26 --> 3158.11
building

3155.77 --> 3160.24
seventeen point three miles but then

3158.11 --> 3164.7400000000002
what I'm gonna go is going to be 28

3160.24 --> 3168.1
miles away so that will be interesting

3164.74 --> 3169.45
to a shed and then my viewer height is

3168.1 --> 3171.37
going to be lower because it's going to

3169.45 --> 3173.0699999999997
be in the shore of the actual

3171.37 --> 3176.14
so it's gonna be a five foot high

3173.07 --> 3179.9700000000003
observation as my truck I put my tripod

3176.14 --> 3182.41
stand the only one was a 17 foot high

3179.97 --> 3183.6099999999997
observation and I was able to see like

3182.41 --> 3187.0
pretty much the whole building

3183.61 --> 3189.7000000000003
now these been almost 30 miles away with

3187.0 --> 3192.28
five foot high if I get the building I

3189.7 --> 3194.49
mean that would be freaking awesome I'll

3192.28 --> 3209.3100000000004
be freaking fluttered on the persimmon

3194.49 --> 3209.31
yeah can't wait to see it right so

3211.08 --> 3222.52
anything else anyone has to share and

3215.89 --> 3224.89
now we got five more minutes roughly do

3222.52 --> 3230.71
you ever think about getting a t-1000 or

3224.89 --> 3235.87
p900 Arland oh yeah absolutely so it's

3230.71 --> 3239.14
part of my my youtube strategy should

3235.87 --> 3242.89
say that yeah I want those thousand

3239.14 --> 3245.41
subscribers some point and try to get it

3242.89 --> 3250.54
that way yeah I don't really want to go

3245.41 --> 3253.1499999999996
with like a GoFundMe just want to let it

3250.54 --> 3257.19
naturally stack up and then it's one of

3253.15 --> 3260.8
the first things I'll get with it I

3257.19 --> 3265.12
don't know it all depends on how fast it

3260.8 --> 3266.98
does you know it nobody gets me anything

3265.12 --> 3271.72
and you don't have to if you don't want

3266.98 --> 3274.39
to once that's possible but yeah maybe

3271.72 --> 3276.97
if it takes too long then I will go fund

3274.39 --> 3279.97
me or whatever but I don't think it's

3276.97 --> 3283.1499999999996
really necessary I just wanted a

3279.97 --> 3285.97
