[Music]

68.54 --> 73.64

101.159 --> 107.57900000000001
can always use the support

103.979 --> 112.86
but yeah beside me using needing support

107.579 --> 115.55999999999999
today also I'd like to ask you to take a

112.86 --> 118.439
look at the gifts and go from chocolate

115.56 --> 121.799
Saiyan because he's in a really

118.439 --> 124.19999999999999
tight spot needing it

121.799 --> 126.899
pretty acutely

124.2 --> 130.8
so it's like an emergency fund really

126.899 --> 133.2
and yeah to ask you guys to at least

130.8 --> 135.36
take a look and if you you're not gonna

133.2 --> 137.04
or able to support him then at least

135.36 --> 139.02
spread it around

137.04 --> 140.76
to other guys that might know like

139.02 --> 144.3
flatter debates

140.76 --> 146.099
uh because like the the future of

144.3 --> 148.37900000000002
chocolate saying could literally be in

146.099 --> 151.92
the balance here and him his ability to

148.379 --> 155.819
even be on the Flat Earth debate show so

151.92 --> 157.73899999999998
or the internet entirely for that matter

155.819 --> 161.76
right

157.739 --> 164.459
anyway uh weather today

161.76 --> 166.26
is extremely beautiful this is not what

164.459 --> 167.58
the weather forecast was saying at all

166.26 --> 170.54
but uh

167.58 --> 170.54000000000002
I'll take it

170.819 --> 173.66
there's some

176.28 --> 181.86
some nature management going on there

179.16 --> 183.9
they're probably in anticipation for the

181.86 --> 186.42000000000002
storm season

183.9 --> 189.08
cutting some of the branches there of

186.42 --> 189.07999999999998
those trees

191.4 --> 198.37900000000002
hope they don't trim it down too

193.98 --> 198.379
dramatically but probably not

199.44 --> 208.459
but yeah it's super blue clear sky

203.22 --> 208.459
there are some Trails happening

208.739 --> 212.04
but

210.3 --> 213.59900000000002
yeah I mean there's plenty of blue

212.04 --> 217.879
around

213.599 --> 217.879
it's not like there's Trails everywhere

219.42 --> 227.17999999999998
so it's really bright and sunny it seems

221.819 --> 227.17999999999998
to be relatively low wind down here

227.4 --> 232.26000000000002
though it seems that up there the wind

229.86 --> 235.98000000000002
is rushing like I can literally see the

232.26 --> 239.12
trail up there move

235.98 --> 239.11999999999998
away from me

244.86 --> 250.22000000000003
but down here no it's pretty yeah it's

247.14 --> 250.22
it's really nice weather

257.639 --> 263.78000000000003
cool on a voting day too this is nice

260.639 --> 263.78000000000003
it's not raining or anything

266.16 --> 270.18
hello Richard G first in chat good to

268.62 --> 276.6
see you

270.18 --> 276.6
it is Wednesday the 15th of March 2023

282.96 --> 290.71999999999997
and yeah I mean again about the uh

287.22 --> 290.72
the Joko fund

292.32 --> 297.3
man yeah uh

295.139 --> 299.16
I can't get into many details I mean

297.3 --> 300.12
like chocolate saying is kind of private

299.16 --> 301.08000000000004
about

300.12 --> 304.5
the

301.08 --> 306.65999999999997
origin of the situation

304.5 --> 309.66
but I mean

306.66 --> 311.639
like I definitely trust him and I really

309.66 --> 315.0
appreciate having him around and I feel

311.639 --> 317.40000000000003
like a dick if I wasn't part of this

315.0 --> 319.74
effort to help him out

317.4 --> 320.88
and a lot of people have actually helped

319.74 --> 324.479
him out

320.88 --> 326.1
in relatively short time but I mean more

324.479 --> 329.21999999999997
is better

326.1 --> 331.88
it's a it's a pretty heavy situation

329.22 --> 331.88000000000005
uh

332.22 --> 336.84000000000003
so keep spreading it around

334.259 --> 340.02000000000004
gifts and goes first time that any of us

336.84 --> 342.479
are using that so it's new to us

340.02 --> 343.919
new to me I've heard of it before but

342.479 --> 346.15999999999997
I've never actually been involved with

343.919 --> 346.15999999999997
it

349.38 --> 351.86
right

353.039 --> 358.62
so if you know yeah if you're not

355.86 --> 361.32
planning to donate or you can't

358.62 --> 364.56
then at least share the link to others

361.32 --> 366.96
of the flatters that are associated

364.56 --> 368.22
or like the Flat Earth debate that you

366.96 --> 370.02
know

368.22 --> 371.639
chocolate saying you know he's been part

370.02 --> 374.639
of it for like

371.639 --> 377.0
over a half the entire running time of

374.639 --> 377.0
the show

378.539 --> 384.31899999999996
three quarters even or something so he's

381.24 --> 384.319
been there for a long time

388.5 --> 393.1
always been a

390.199 --> 395.58000000000004
stabilizing Factor

393.1 --> 398.58000000000004
[Music]

395.58 --> 398.58
diplomatic

398.819 --> 405.72
and very entertaining and always finding

401.1 --> 408.3
ways even like for his for himself to

405.72 --> 409.91900000000004
deal with agitation with humor and he's

408.3 --> 412.139
like very talented

409.919 --> 414.479
I mean when he chocolate goes laughing

412.139 --> 416.639
it's very infectious

414.479 --> 419.4
so yeah I really like having the guy

416.639 --> 421.319
around at the Flat Earth debates

419.4 --> 425.0
it's like the chocolate on top and I

421.319 --> 425.0
appreciate it if he stay around

428.759 --> 434.78000000000003
so yeah spread the link

431.52 --> 434.78
or donate if you can

436.58 --> 444.44
save some for me though I still need

441.72 --> 447.36
regular maintenance for food but I mean

444.44 --> 450.02
this is pretty acute

447.36 --> 450.02000000000004
right

457.68 --> 463.46
so

458.94 --> 463.46
keep checking on that every now and then

474.0 --> 477.62
right so

478.5 --> 482.4
what are we gonna talk about I'm not

480.36 --> 487.52000000000004
just going to talk about the chocolate

482.4 --> 487.52
the choco fund the entire show

488.84 --> 495.79999999999995
don't worry about it didn't really have

491.88 --> 495.8
any other subject at the ready though

500.34 --> 503.34
uh

509.84 --> 515.039
right so yeah yesterday

512.64 --> 518.8199999999999
Flat Earth debate was pretty cool

515.039 --> 520.68
although Nathan did round it out

518.82 --> 524.1800000000001
like pretty early

520.68 --> 524.18
like the after show even

525.0 --> 528.66
and then later

527.04 --> 531.0
uh

528.66 --> 534.48
QE live

531.0 --> 537.0
and yeah it was really all about the the

534.48 --> 537.899
chocolate saying situation and and just

537.0 --> 540.24
talking

537.899 --> 543.0
in general

540.24 --> 544.98
it was very very fun show

543.0 --> 549.24
so happy to be part of that was mostly

544.98 --> 551.279
just a QE anime Academy

549.24 --> 553.019
and he'll bumping in there for a bit

551.279 --> 555.24
sometimes

553.019 --> 557.88
but it was just a fun show it was a good

555.24 --> 560.72
atmosphere

557.88 --> 560.72
spiritually

564.0 --> 567.38
okay is anybody gonna

568.56 --> 574.8199999999999
I

570.18 --> 574.8199999999999
anybody there jet 14 watching

593.88 --> 599.06
right yeah it seems to me mostly just

595.86 --> 599.0600000000001
trimming it

604.08 --> 606.5
anyway

618.92 --> 624.959
to support you before

622.2 --> 628.26
well Nathan has actually

624.959 --> 630.8389999999999
yeah openly on the Flat Earth debate

628.26 --> 635.6
without me asking or anything ask for

630.839 --> 635.6
people to also support me yes

635.76 --> 638.76
foreign

643.1 --> 649.399
in like the time when I really need it

645.72 --> 653.279
for example when my computer got bust

649.399 --> 656.779
yeah they guy also helped me out the

653.279 --> 656.779
guys also helped me out with that

663.24 --> 668.279
so yeah I mean this is just what we do

665.779 --> 672.72
like we are

668.279 --> 676.56
a team and friends and

672.72 --> 679.26
like if somebody's gonna get and get

676.56 --> 681.2399999999999
into some situation and

679.26 --> 683.7
like their financial situation the

681.24 --> 685.92
stabilizes like yeah we want to help out

683.7 --> 688.0400000000001
because we don't want to lose them you

685.92 --> 688.04
know

691.86 --> 696.36
they've been stuck around they've been

694.38 --> 698.48
sticking around for a long time for a

696.36 --> 698.48
reason

701.839 --> 707.519
and even with people that are relatively

704.82 --> 709.5
new we still help them out

707.519 --> 711.74
like with flat side it was relatively

709.5 --> 711.74
new

722.459 --> 727.3389999999999
so yes flat taholics anonymous

734.26 --> 738.959
[Music]

737.1 --> 742.86
ah

738.959 --> 745.4399999999999
man the weather is so gorgeous

742.86 --> 748.6800000000001
I should really just like

745.44 --> 750.4200000000001
go and walk in the park or something

748.68 --> 752.399
it's gonna be

750.42 --> 754.9399999999999
tons of people

752.399 --> 754.94
probably

755.339 --> 758.12
out there

761.519 --> 767.04
foreign

763.86 --> 769.16
but yeah I mean this sounds kind of

767.04 --> 771.779
silly but like

769.16 --> 774.26
I'm thinking again it's probably not

771.779 --> 774.26
gonna work

775.8 --> 780.4799999999999
I don't know I feel kind of silly for it

777.959 --> 783.2399999999999
but I yeah as I've been saying I really

780.48 --> 784.9200000000001
want some new pants and that sounds so

783.24 --> 787.339
silly and I don't know it's probably not

784.92 --> 787.3389999999999
gonna work

788.519 --> 796.68
but I might do like a GoFundMe for that

793.56 --> 797.899
it wouldn't even be that much

796.68 --> 800.579
really

797.899 --> 803.94
like a new computer would be a lot more

800.579 --> 806.9399999999999
expensive and I in a ways I'd actually

803.94 --> 808.86
like that the idea of

806.94 --> 811.5
that I might be able to get a new

808.86 --> 815.72
computer again at some point although to

811.5 --> 815.72
be fair what I got is just really fine

819.3 --> 827.519
I mean I'm maybe a new monitor

822.779 --> 830.399
this one is also functional I got it

827.519 --> 833.4590000000001
from Dutch sailor

830.399 --> 835.68
when my monitors the power system just

833.459 --> 839.579
died

835.68 --> 842.76
but it is kind of smaller but again to

839.579 --> 845.06
be fair I'm this it works it works just

842.76 --> 845.06
fine

845.399 --> 850.92
so there's no direct necessity but when

848.22 --> 852.9590000000001
it concerns my social life

850.92 --> 855.779
for me

852.959 --> 858.06
my confidence right which is integral

855.779 --> 859.4399999999999
part of your social life if you want to

858.06 --> 861.68
get somewhere

859.44 --> 861.6800000000001
foreign

862.519 --> 866.49
and not just some regular ones in the

866.279 --> 869.779
store

866.49 --> 869.779
[Music]

875.459 --> 880.92
I want some pants that'll let last very

878.1 --> 882.5400000000001
long so I don't have to worry about that

880.92 --> 884.699
anymore

882.54 --> 886.62
that's how I got these and they lasted

884.699 --> 888.4799999999999
forever I mean it was probably the best

886.62 --> 890.4590000000001
investment ever

888.48 --> 892.6800000000001
you know other people might like buy a

890.459 --> 894.8389999999999
new pair of pants every

892.68 --> 897.899
yeah

894.839 --> 899.7600000000001
and then like combine wear them and [ __ ]

897.899 --> 904.079
and

899.76 --> 906.12
well I just bought two two pair

904.079 --> 910.8199999999999
and that's it

906.12 --> 910.82
and that lasted like 10 years

911.699 --> 917.5999999999999
just wearing those two pants so like

914.279 --> 922.459
that's a good investment I'd say

917.6 --> 922.4590000000001
environmentally friendly there I say

927.06 --> 933.66
walk in the park would be a good idea

930.36 --> 935.76
yeah but if I walk in the park

933.66 --> 938.16
feeling like a bum

935.76 --> 939.899
feeling like I look like a bum even

938.16 --> 942.54
though I might have a pretty face or

939.899 --> 945.6
whatever in my opinion

942.54 --> 947.579
like it's not helpful I don't want to be

945.6 --> 949.1990000000001
seen like that

947.579 --> 951.66
I don't want to be approached

949.199 --> 953.76
potentially by people in their minds

951.66 --> 955.8
like oh well you're like a bum or

953.76 --> 959.279
something or you're really poor I don't

955.8 --> 962.899
want that I don't want to partake in

959.279 --> 962.899
that angle of approach

965.579 --> 968.42
but yeah

969.12 --> 976.38
I got new pants that no problem

972.899 --> 978.3
I didn't well we had no problem I it

976.38 --> 980.279
really helped in the past in the past I

978.3 --> 981.959
was just I would do that I would just

980.279 --> 985.279
like oh I feel like wandering around

981.959 --> 985.279
seeing what I'm gonna bump into

988.92 --> 993.5
but it worked because I didn't look like

991.079 --> 993.5
a bum

1005.959 --> 1010.88
right anyway

1007.779 --> 1012.92
this maybe for like the springtime or

1010.88 --> 1016.82
something but

1012.92 --> 1020.54
I don't know maybe as I even said before

1016.82 --> 1024.799
on my shows if anybody remembers

1020.54 --> 1029.6
I might like to try it out in Spring

1024.799 --> 1031.22
with the vacation money that I get

1029.6 --> 1033.3799999999999
which

1031.22 --> 1036.559
you know fact it's more likely that I'll

1033.38 --> 1040.16
spend it all on just trying to pay me

1036.559 --> 1043.54
the debts though that's usually how that

1040.16 --> 1043.5400000000002
ends up but who knows

1045.5 --> 1052.1
right an alternative would be a GoFundMe

1048.799 --> 1054.679
or like a gift send go

1052.1 --> 1057.08
for new pants it's like it yeah and it's

1054.679 --> 1059.179
a joke and I feel really silly

1057.08 --> 1061.9399999999998
especially because Owen Benjamin made

1059.179 --> 1064.64
like Fancy Pants a whole thing

1061.94 --> 1067.8200000000002
but I almost like won it

1064.64 --> 1071.98
I want to step in that trap almost like

1067.82 --> 1071.98
for comedic value like that

1074.48 --> 1078.82
and it's just like yeah I mean

1079.76 --> 1083.5
I'm being pragmatic here

1084.679 --> 1089.48
right I don't like I'm not gonna sell

1087.26 --> 1090.44
out for new pants let's just say it like

1089.48 --> 1092.3600000000001
that

1090.44 --> 1095.679
and that's really what the whole Fancy

1092.36 --> 1095.6789999999999
Pants lollipops was about

1096.02 --> 1099.34
and that's not happening

1108.4 --> 1113.2
people are judgmental well

1114.679 --> 1118.66
if you don't know somebody

1118.88 --> 1125.1200000000001
you gotta size them up you know Richard

1121.94 --> 1128.2
G is not unreasonable I to call that

1125.12 --> 1128.1999999999998
judgmental is

1128.26 --> 1135.559
is assuming too much

1131.78 --> 1139.58
motivation behind it

1135.559 --> 1142.4189999999999
right I mean if they really knew you and

1139.58 --> 1142.4189999999999
then you'd like

1144.14 --> 1148.76
look off or something or you're sick and

1146.66 --> 1150.919
then they get judgmental like oh you're

1148.76 --> 1153.679
not up to standard anymore yeah that's

1150.919 --> 1155.2990000000002
[ __ ] up right but if you don't know

1153.679 --> 1157.76
somebody how else are you gonna size

1155.299 --> 1160.94
them up by how they look what they're

1157.76 --> 1162.44
wearing Etc I mean you gotta go on you

1160.94 --> 1164.919
don't know them you know it's only

1162.44 --> 1164.919
logical

1167.419 --> 1169.6000000000001
foreign

1171.76 --> 1177.02
puzzle of of meeting somebody like you

1175.4 --> 1179.2
you don't know them you got to size them

1177.02 --> 1179.2
up

1180.08 --> 1184.28
you can't just immediately go ask oh

1182.36 --> 1186.9189999999999
could you please deliver me your entire

1184.28 --> 1189.74
background story and don't hold anything

1186.919 --> 1192.2
back I mean don't attempt to make

1189.74 --> 1193.039
yourself look better than you think you

1192.2 --> 1195.98
are

1193.039 --> 1197.48
I mean nobody does that ever oh yeah

1195.98 --> 1201.38
they do it all the time

1197.48 --> 1203.84
so people just size people up by what's

1201.38 --> 1205.7600000000002
tangible

1203.84 --> 1208.1789999999999
when they don't know him it's only

1205.76 --> 1208.179
logical

1208.58 --> 1213.62
yeah Nathan of course dude it's in the

1211.4 --> 1217.48
title

1213.62 --> 1217.4799999999998
it's in the title of the show Nathan

1228.38 --> 1232.64
no I I talked about it immediately at

1231.2 --> 1235.6000000000001
the start of the show

1232.64 --> 1235.6000000000001
oh wow

1235.94 --> 1238.78
huh

1243.64 --> 1249.2
wow this thing has really been going all

1247.4 --> 1251.66
night

1249.2 --> 1254.0800000000002
now it's literally at a thousand dollars

1251.66 --> 1254.0800000000002
awesome

1257.12 --> 1263.559
so yeah keep it coming guys

1259.94 --> 1267.2
this is the chocolate bailout

1263.559 --> 1270.26
it might even I I don't know I I'm not I

1267.2 --> 1271.76
shouldn't be trying to gossip but I

1270.26 --> 1273.919
don't know exactly what happened but it

1271.76 --> 1275.84
might be like even involved with the

1273.919 --> 1279.44
bank [ __ ] I mean

1275.84 --> 1282.5
you know I'm hypers and it sounds really

1279.44 --> 1284.66
wrong but I mean hypothetically what if

1282.5 --> 1286.46
chocolate was like had money in one of

1284.66 --> 1289.28
those Banks or something

1286.46 --> 1291.8600000000001
and suddenly it it just was all gone

1289.28 --> 1294.3799999999999
there have been banks around America

1291.86 --> 1297.6789999999999
where suddenly like

1294.38 --> 1299.6000000000001
like half the money's all gone

1297.679 --> 1300.98
on people's accounts I've seen videos

1299.6 --> 1302.84
about that

1300.98 --> 1304.64
so maybe something like that I don't

1302.84 --> 1307.58
know exactly what happened it could also

1304.64 --> 1312.0200000000002
be maybe like crypto related

1307.58 --> 1316.34
so who knows exactly chocolate knows

1312.02 --> 1318.62
but it was very serious and he's he

1316.34 --> 1322.039
never

1318.62 --> 1323.84
like he technically didn't even want to

1322.039 --> 1327.98
ask for help

1323.84 --> 1330.32
us guys kind of like forced it on him

1327.98 --> 1333.8600000000001
because he is really modest and he's

1330.32 --> 1335.84
kind of proud so he doesn't like to beg

1333.86 --> 1338.24
at all

1335.84 --> 1339.559
right but we're like yes screw you

1338.24 --> 1342.2
chocolate

1339.559 --> 1344.78
ooh you and your pride oh yeah [ __ ] you

1342.2 --> 1348.2
we don't want to lose you man

1344.78 --> 1351.6399999999999
you're gonna you're gonna take it and

1348.2 --> 1351.64
you're gonna like it your hair

1356.24 --> 1359.559
and you're gonna fix it

1370.58 --> 1376.3999999999999
right and I I really agree with that

1373.159 --> 1380.419
sentiment even though I I I really have

1376.4 --> 1382.52
nothing to give except for my attention

1380.419 --> 1385.46
add my skill

1382.52 --> 1387.26
of analysis and I have

1385.46 --> 1390.3400000000001
and there's plenty to praise about

1387.26 --> 1390.34
chocolate really

1391.28 --> 1398.2
but a lot of it is also just that he's

1393.62 --> 1398.1999999999998
it's very pleasant to have in the panel

1403.28 --> 1408.3799999999999
for us guys so it's just like yeah we

1405.74 --> 1410.74
really do need it and so that's why we

1408.38 --> 1410.74
insist

1410.78 --> 1414.34
we need that chocolate on top

1426.919 --> 1435.5590000000002
right so check out the uh gifts and go

1432.26 --> 1438.3799999999999
choco fund and help them out if you can

1435.559 --> 1440.96
or if you if you're not able to right

1438.38 --> 1442.3400000000001
now and it is kind of a rush thing I

1440.96 --> 1444.6200000000001
mean this is not a thing that's going to

1442.34 --> 1446.6589999999999
be sitting there for like a month

1444.62 --> 1450.039
so it's a pretty short-term thing it's

1446.659 --> 1450.0390000000002
like required quickly

1450.32 --> 1455.36
so if you can't support it right now

1452.74 --> 1457.64
then share it

1455.36 --> 1461.1789999999999
make sure that other people

1457.64 --> 1463.2800000000002
that know Flat Earth debate

1461.179 --> 1465.679
that they know about it like yeah a

1463.28 --> 1469.4189999999999
panel members in real serious trouble

1465.679 --> 1469.419
and they really need help quickly

1469.94 --> 1474.74
so if you like chocolate

1472.82 --> 1477.1399999999999
if you like the guy on the flight of

1474.74 --> 1479.72
debates then yeah

1477.14 --> 1482.2990000000002
donate to the fund to the choco fund

1479.72 --> 1485.24
little bit or people have actually

1482.299 --> 1490.34
thrown like somebody in there threw like

1485.24 --> 1493.299
250 dollars at it like whoa so

1490.34 --> 1493.299
it's serious

1493.58 --> 1498.34
but other people just five dollars and

1495.919 --> 1498.3400000000001
that's fine

1500.9 --> 1507.4
any bit is much appreciated so that he

1503.48 --> 1507.4
can just get out of this situation

1507.559 --> 1510.5
and we can have a great summer with

1509.48 --> 1513.919
chocolate

1510.5 --> 1515.419
without him being miserable or like not

1513.919 --> 1517.5800000000002
present because he literally doesn't

1515.419 --> 1519.6200000000001
have time anymore

1517.58 --> 1521.96
I mean he's already working his ass off

1519.62 --> 1524.559
continually like even during the show

1521.96 --> 1524.559
and all that

1529.1 --> 1534.08
so yeah it's not like oh well chocolate

1531.679 --> 1537.44
just good another job like what the [ __ ]

1534.08 --> 1538.9399999999998
man no no it's not gonna work like that

1537.44 --> 1543.26
yeah

1538.94 --> 1546.2
I mean he is working overtime and [ __ ]

1543.26 --> 1548.0
he kind of always is he's real Workhorse

1546.2 --> 1550.8400000000001
the guy

1548.0 --> 1550.84
always working

1556.4 --> 1562.279
but even a Workhorse can get into

1559.34 --> 1563.9599999999998
unexpected financial trouble and then

1562.279 --> 1565.76
there's like very little maneuvering

1563.96 --> 1568.7
room because they're already working

1565.76 --> 1572.32
their ass off right

1568.7 --> 1572.32
so we gotta help him out

1589.88 --> 1592.88
uh

1593.659 --> 1597.279
planaholics could be

1599.779 --> 1606.039
I don't know what the amount exactly is

1602.9 --> 1606.039
based on it could be

1611.6 --> 1618.32
but I'm not sure exactly how it's

1614.12 --> 1621.34
calculated I I just get an amount and I

1618.32 --> 1621.34
try to get by with it

1621.559 --> 1623.559
um

1635.6 --> 1639.76
that Nathan guy is all right too

1644.9 --> 1649.88
right yeah thanks Richard G no I get it

1648.14 --> 1653.38
I get you're not in a position to help

1649.88 --> 1653.38
but yeah I mean

1654.32 --> 1659.12
if you can find anybody else right and

1657.559 --> 1661.6589999999999
tell them the story I mean is this

1659.12 --> 1661.6589999999999
working guy

1661.82 --> 1669.559
I mean he's like one awesome

1665.62 --> 1672.1399999999999
badass black dude

1669.559 --> 1675.08
it was great to have around his super

1672.14 --> 1677.179
working hard I mean he crushes it's

1675.08 --> 1680.96
always working

1677.179 --> 1683.539
and and like he's not a complainer

1680.96 --> 1685.46
he's great with humor and he's part of

1683.539 --> 1688.039
the Flat Earth debate he he's the

1685.46 --> 1690.2
chuckapedia man so like there's a lot to

1688.039 --> 1692.36
like about chocolate saying but if you

1690.2 --> 1693.98
just tell people like yeah but this is a

1692.36 --> 1695.9599999999998
real hard working guy and he's in

1693.98 --> 1697.76
certain financial trouble that might be

1695.96 --> 1700.279
enough maybe you don't even have to tell

1697.76 --> 1702.2
them like it's flat earth right in the

1700.279 --> 1703.88
good gifts and go there's no Mansion of

1702.2 --> 1706.159
Flat Earth

1703.88 --> 1707.48
just tell them like that this is a

1706.159 --> 1711.6200000000001
really

1707.48 --> 1714.44
awesome black dude who works his ass off

1711.62 --> 1716.36
and he's always working

1714.44 --> 1719.059
right and he's in sudden financial

1716.36 --> 1720.1999999999998
trouble and he needs some help

1719.059 --> 1721.76
right

1720.2 --> 1723.679
maybe you just don't even have to

1721.76 --> 1727.48
mention Flat Earth

1723.679 --> 1727.48
maybe that story is good enough

1730.059 --> 1733.1789999999999
all right

1741.26 --> 1744.72
[Music]

1757.94 --> 1761.14
all right anyway

1764.72 --> 1767.559
let's see

1774.26 --> 1779.72
right and there's also a prayer button

1777.02 --> 1782.059
apparently you can click

1779.72 --> 1783.02
and let him know that you're praying for

1782.059 --> 1786.08
him did

1783.02 --> 1787.76
it's like a Christian little gag with it

1786.08 --> 1791.5
or something I think

1787.76 --> 1791.5
probably Christian inspired

1791.659 --> 1797.8600000000001
so you could do that too

1795.08 --> 1801.3799999999999
you can also yeah that does also like

1797.86 --> 1803.24
shows just how many yeah there is a

1801.38 --> 1805.5200000000002
prey

1803.24 --> 1809.799
bar and then you can basically see how

1805.52 --> 1809.799
many people at least care

1811.52 --> 1815.98
so it's a pretty uh Nifty system

1820.64 --> 1825.1000000000001
so share the choco fund

1827.72 --> 1830.919
and help a brother out

1847.279 --> 1851.36
that's actually you're cool yeah that it

1850.58 --> 1854.96
has

1851.36 --> 1856.8799999999999
you have a bar no it's a button

1854.96 --> 1860.419
you have to share

1856.88 --> 1864.74
donate and the prayer button

1860.419 --> 1864.74
and gifts and go yeah

1871.7 --> 1878.059
God hasn't Twitter now

1874.1 --> 1878.059
it's hilarious

1880.24 --> 1887.059
now it's just a thoughtfulness button

1884.24 --> 1888.74
basically it's just like oh then you can

1887.059 --> 1891.74
you can just click it

1888.74 --> 1894.86
it doesn't force you to literally

1891.74 --> 1896.48
address God and start praying you know

1894.86 --> 1899.059
it's just you click the button it's just

1896.48 --> 1901.52
like oh somebody thought of me and they

1899.059 --> 1904.22
just say pray

1901.52 --> 1906.44
you can actually pray for them

1904.22 --> 1909.26
but with the button you can just let

1906.44 --> 1911.919
them know like hey I saw this and yeah

1909.26 --> 1911.919
I care

1912.32 --> 1918.3799999999999
whether you pay or not

1915.26 --> 1921.919
just yeah I know that and you know that

1918.38 --> 1924.5590000000002
I always take such jokes literal and all

1921.919 --> 1928.24
that you know I do that Godzilla

1924.559 --> 1928.24
everybody knows that by now

1928.299 --> 1932.899
oh a silly remark that's obviously a

1931.039 --> 1935.899
joke oh yeah I'm literally going to

1932.899 --> 1938.899
presuppose that is reality now

1935.899 --> 1941.6589999999999
yeah that's what I do

1938.899 --> 1943.76
so you could call it humor it's just

1941.659 --> 1947.0200000000002
really weird humor

1943.76 --> 1947.02
it's reversed humor

1948.98 --> 1953.74
maybe it's not humor I don't know you

1951.32 --> 1953.74
never know

1959.659 --> 1963.7600000000002
well how could God have a Twitter

1965.48 --> 1970.48
like what's gonna be interfacing with it

1977.36 --> 1980.62
how would that work

1981.74 --> 1987.559
I mean he's saying that there would be

1984.62 --> 1990.6789999999999
some angel or something because God

1987.559 --> 1993.44
himself like doesn't gum hair you know

1990.679 --> 1997.22
that's misassumption

1993.44 --> 1999.799
with an angel maybe like Angels do what

1997.22 --> 2002.679
what needs to be done for God

1999.799 --> 2005.9189999999999
so me we're saying oh there's an angel

2002.679 --> 2007.419
like a a cyber angel

2005.919 --> 2010.2990000000002
who has

2007.419 --> 2012.779
Twitter like who interface with social

2010.299 --> 2012.779
media

2012.94 --> 2018.659
it sounds like a real gamma Legend rumor

2016.059 --> 2018.6589999999999
really but

2021.399 --> 2026.799
but who knows what is interfacing it

2024.58 --> 2029.3799999999999
might be there look

2026.799 --> 2031.72
if people can like be mediums and

2029.38 --> 2033.5800000000002
channel other creatures

2031.72 --> 2037.0
that are not them

2033.58 --> 2039.6999999999998
then what's to say that

2037.0 --> 2041.799
those creatures don't actually at some

2039.7 --> 2044.32
point just choose like hey I want to

2041.799 --> 2048.04
have my own Twitter account I want to

2044.32 --> 2050.139
have a representation official thing

2048.04 --> 2052.119
through a medium

2050.139 --> 2054.96
I mean

2052.119 --> 2054.96
why not

2056.26 --> 2062.389
but would that be God

2059.27 --> 2062.389
[Music]

2062.46 --> 2067.919
that's

2064.359 --> 2067.919
it's a bit for a fetched

2071.379 --> 2075.06
or dangerous at least

2075.28 --> 2082.599
because what happens somebody is being

2078.339 --> 2085.54
recognized as God then people will have

2082.599 --> 2088.06
like worshiping feelings they will start

2085.54 --> 2089.98
to do spiritual things with that

2088.06 --> 2092.2799999999997
and then who's to say that's gonna stay

2089.98 --> 2092.28
God

2092.5 --> 2099.54
I mean I experienced that in my own way

2096.04 --> 2099.54
with my medium experience

2100.42 --> 2106.599
when I met a girl that happened to be

2104.02 --> 2109.66
that happened to have that

2106.599 --> 2114.7200000000003
and I had like a prolonged contact with

2109.66 --> 2114.72
like a very bizarre spirit in her

2114.88 --> 2121.92
it's very young but like really smart

2118.24 --> 2121.9199999999996
and it's it was odd because

2123.339 --> 2127.119
I was been wondering like what that was

2125.079 --> 2130.3
if that's just like a dormant

2127.119 --> 2134.079
intelligence of that girl

2130.3 --> 2136.6600000000003
that she manifests like that or

2134.079 --> 2138.94
whether it was really just an

2136.66 --> 2142.06
intelligence that was like

2138.94 --> 2145.96
in ways smarter than her

2142.06 --> 2149.5
that's really what made me think

2145.96 --> 2151.48
is this like a another personality type

2149.5 --> 2154.359
of act because I've been pondering that

2151.48 --> 2157.72
a lot with mediums like even with myself

2154.359 --> 2160.24
what I do like is this just is this

2157.72 --> 2161.4399999999996
something else that's using me to

2160.24 --> 2163.2999999999997
communicate

2161.44 --> 2167.32
or is this

2163.3 --> 2168.76
another part of me that just manifests

2167.32 --> 2171.1600000000003
like that

2168.76 --> 2171.96
I've literally been pondering that type

2171.16 --> 2175.1189999999997
of

2171.96 --> 2178.18
fundamental question about the entire

2175.119 --> 2179.38
entirety of it of it's a as a phenomenon

2178.18 --> 2182.64
mediums

2179.38 --> 2182.6400000000003
channeling like that

2189.119 --> 2195.2200000000003
right but if you would presuppose that

2191.92 --> 2197.859
it is definitely like a potential Godly

2195.22 --> 2199.8999999999996
entity or an angel or whatever

2197.859 --> 2202.839
well I have experienced literally with

2199.9 --> 2206.26
that person how I would communicate ask

2202.839 --> 2208.839
things and propose things and I share my

2206.26 --> 2211.78
ideas and that eventually

2208.839 --> 2214.7799999999997
it turned sour

2211.78 --> 2217.78
it suddenly started to like show

2214.78 --> 2217.78
unexpected

2217.8 --> 2224.44
wishes like things that it wanted and it

2221.68 --> 2227.2599999999998
started to feel like vampiric

2224.44 --> 2229.119
wasn't overt yet it wasn't like oh we

2227.26 --> 2231.3390000000004
want you to bring sacrifice and not

2229.119 --> 2236.619
nothing as dramatic and ridiculous as

2231.339 --> 2238.66
that but I could feel it

2236.619 --> 2242.099
from it

2238.66 --> 2245.859
like the attitude changed it became like

2242.099 --> 2250.3
it wanted something now and that's not

2245.859 --> 2253.0
Divine that that wasn't like what it

2250.3 --> 2258.46
was before

2253.0 --> 2260.859
so yeah I'm again I'm taking it way out

2258.46 --> 2262.96
of control serious Godzilla that one

2260.859 --> 2264.88
statement and making an entire esoteric

2262.96 --> 2268.06
subject out of it because that's what I

2264.88 --> 2268.06
do sometimes

2268.119 --> 2274.06
see what happens when you make a joke

2271.119 --> 2276.94
you get an entire subject based on

2274.06 --> 2278.92
Spirit esoterics out of your supposed

2276.94 --> 2281.88
joke

2278.92 --> 2281.88
so keep going

2283.839 --> 2288.119
if God had a tweet what would it be

2290.14 --> 2292.98
uh

2298.18 --> 2301.14
keep going

2306.9 --> 2310.2000000000003
I don't know

2336.4 --> 2340.56
hello by the way price Phantom good to

2338.32 --> 2340.56
see you

2366.16 --> 2368.7599999999998
okay

2392.7 --> 2397.0
I see what they're yeah they're really

2395.14 --> 2399.22
it's wind prepping

2397.0 --> 2402.16
so they're not like cutting the the

2399.22 --> 2405.0989999999997
bigger branches of their cutting

2402.16 --> 2407.3799999999997
the thinner branches off

2405.099 --> 2410.56
a bit

2407.38 --> 2412.859
so it has less traction when storms

2410.56 --> 2412.859
happen

2413.26 --> 2418.5
I mean these maintenance people really

2415.66 --> 2418.5
know what they're doing

2419.74 --> 2426.339
and now the difference between me and me

2422.5 --> 2427.839
like 25 years ago is that now I also get

2426.339 --> 2429.5789999999997
what they're doing

2427.839 --> 2432.04
much better

2429.579 --> 2435.599
because before it's like oh why do you

2432.04 --> 2435.599
hurt the trees just let them grow

2436.119 --> 2443.32
seriously I was really stupid happy in

2439.3 --> 2446.2000000000003
ways like that overly sentimental

2443.32 --> 2448.839
I just I still don't like it but I mean

2446.2 --> 2452.5789999999997
I just don't like it when trees like

2448.839 --> 2452.5789999999997
have big chunks cut off them

2456.96 --> 2463.3
a little bit of trimming

2459.48 --> 2466.72
it's great that prevents the like the

2463.3 --> 2472.26
main bark the main branches the trunk

2466.72 --> 2472.2599999999998
from breaking you know I'm all for it

2474.16 --> 2477.66
hey Oz good to see you

2483.88 --> 2487.78
move what

2502.839 --> 2505.5
hmm

2508.2 --> 2512.74
am I legally allowed to grow venomous

2511.119 --> 2515.26
plants over there

2512.74 --> 2519.4199999999996
yeah

2515.26 --> 2519.42
as long as it doesn't bother anybody

2525.4 --> 2529.96
right but I mean

2527.44 --> 2533.7400000000002
for me like growing the plants would be

2529.96 --> 2536.7400000000002
not super difficult it's where the frick

2533.74 --> 2538.4799999999996
are you gonna dry them because that's

2536.74 --> 2543.2999999999997
gonna smell

2538.48 --> 2543.3
really intense and yeah

2544.119 --> 2547.859
I would never be able to do that here

2547.96 --> 2551.8
and I don't know anybody out there would

2550.3 --> 2554.6400000000003
that would be like oh yeah you could

2551.8 --> 2558.82
just borrow my

2554.64 --> 2560.2
room or a garage that's not constantly

2558.82 --> 2564.1600000000003
opening up

2560.2 --> 2566.74
or it has cars in it exhaust

2564.16 --> 2569.3199999999997
like that like not really used for a

2566.74 --> 2572.0789999999997
garage right like I don't know anybody

2569.32 --> 2573.6400000000003
that I would like oh yeah I could just

2572.079 --> 2575.619
go to them and ask them oh could you

2573.64 --> 2578.04
could you hang this here I don't know

2575.619 --> 2578.04
anybody

2580.0 --> 2582.96
that would do that

2593.56 --> 2597.72
if your roommates aren't cool

2602.319 --> 2608.079
you mean if they aren't complete stoners

2605.74 --> 2614.0789999999997
or whatever

2608.079 --> 2614.079
I mean it really smells a lot so

2617.859 --> 2621.42
don't I have a balcony

2621.76 --> 2625.78
what you think I you you think in the

2624.7 --> 2631.3799999999997
Netherlands

2625.78 --> 2631.38
that you can dry cannabis on the balcony

2631.98 --> 2637.48
really

2633.819 --> 2640.3
now this is not Texas dude this is the

2637.48 --> 2644.7
Netherlands this is Rain Country

2640.3 --> 2644.7000000000003
you don't dry things on balcony

2648.099 --> 2652.9
like maybe mid-summer but that's not

2650.56 --> 2654.819
when you're gonna be

2652.9 --> 2658.119
doing that on there like in mid-summer

2654.819 --> 2660.4
it's growing right Harvest Time

2658.119 --> 2663.819
it's gonna be freaking raining after

2660.4 --> 2666.839
that you're gonna have to dry it inside

2663.819 --> 2666.839
doesn't it

2671.56 --> 2676.54
right this is not like Texas or Mexico

2674.02 --> 2680.5
or something

2676.54 --> 2683.7
where it's really dry on average no

2680.5 --> 2683.7
this is Rain Country

2684.28 --> 2687.7200000000003
lots of rivers everywhere

2698.26 --> 2701.2200000000003
oh finally

2701.92 --> 2705.76
yeah I got a connection issue there for

2703.96 --> 2708.599
a bit

2705.76 --> 2708.599
but I'm back

2711.52 --> 2714.66
it's not dry here

2714.88 --> 2717.42
okay

2731.079 --> 2737.5600000000004
what I mean a lot of taxes also has like

2733.839 --> 2740.02
deserts and [ __ ] right

2737.56 --> 2742.48
there's like parts of it

2740.02 --> 2744.819
where you're it's basically it doesn't

2742.48 --> 2746.98
really rain

2744.819 --> 2749.859
I mean Texas is a big freaking State

2746.98 --> 2751.359
Texas is like way bigger than the

2749.859 --> 2753.96
Netherlands

2751.359 --> 2753.96
but

2755.44 --> 2760.839
it also has like deserty

2758.2 --> 2763.4399999999996
West Texas right

2760.839 --> 2763.44
exactly

2789.96 --> 2793.02
all right

2805.0 --> 2809.92
it's gonna take a while

2808.119 --> 2812.4
probably gonna be doing this all

2809.92 --> 2812.4
afternoon

2816.22 --> 2819.0
blurry

2822.819 --> 2825.819
anyway

2827.26 --> 2834.599
it's a nice day I'm gonna be voting

2830.079 --> 2834.599
later for provincial States

2837.04 --> 2841.96
and please support that

2839.44 --> 2844.26
choco fund

2841.96 --> 2844.26
of course

2845.44 --> 2849.3
and if you can't then share it

2882.7 --> 2885.7
hmm

2886.06 --> 2891.099
I'm thinking though

2888.22 --> 2893.3799999999997
if I do it smart I could potentially

2891.099 --> 2897.28
like grow it and then

2893.38 --> 2899.5
it might it might not work out but like

2897.28 --> 2901.599
go to the coffee shop and basically ask

2899.5 --> 2904.26
like do you know somebody who could cure

2901.599 --> 2904.26
cannabis

2904.42 --> 2909.839
because or like one of the guys would

2907.18 --> 2909.839
they do that

2912.339 --> 2917.56
because they they like to stay Anonymous

2914.5 --> 2919.72
and all that typically The Growers

2917.56 --> 2921.9
but they might have the ability to do

2919.72 --> 2921.8999999999996
that

2923.26 --> 2926.88
but it might cost though

2928.119 --> 2933.839
anyway

2930.339 --> 2933.839
or maybe not I don't know

2934.359 --> 2942.119
I mean if I really insisted on it I

2937.78 --> 2942.119
could probably find a way it's just that

2943.48 --> 2949.18
I'll start growing cannabis again when I

2946.0 --> 2952.72
really have like my own garden situation

2949.18 --> 2955.9199999999996
and a place to dry it and not stuck with

2952.72 --> 2955.9199999999996
like other people

2956.56 --> 2959.7599999999998
they don't like that

2971.52 --> 2976.5
quadriceps what

2973.96 --> 2976.5
okay

2978.94 --> 2984.18
okay Oz

2981.339 --> 2984.18
what the

2985.06 --> 2988.179
[Music]

2994.3 --> 2998.2000000000003
yeah man I've been going by the way like

2996.579 --> 2999.099
in the last few days I feel like I'm

2998.2 --> 3001.98
going through some physical

2999.099 --> 3004.26
Transformations due to spring because I

3001.98 --> 3006.18
had like issues where if I would have

3004.26 --> 3009.2400000000002
neglected it I would now have back

3006.18 --> 3012.4199999999996
issues but hey guess what

3009.24 --> 3016.02
I massage stuff I can't find the right

3012.42 --> 3018.359
spots and muscles and literally just

3016.02 --> 3020.22
fix it

3018.359 --> 3022.859
so it's all balanced and that I don't

3020.22 --> 3025.74
get like twisted up and then get back

3022.859 --> 3027.96
issues but I've been feeling that in the

3025.74 --> 3030.2999999999997
last few days and it's like when I go to

3027.96 --> 3033.44
bed I really like need half an hour to

3030.3 --> 3033.44
just get it all straight

3034.74 --> 3041.7
so it's like spring transformation

3036.78 --> 3044.6400000000003
there's a physical transformation part

3041.7 --> 3047.339
some people more pronounced than others

3044.64 --> 3049.3799999999997
so it's not just like your

3047.339 --> 3051.74
your hormones and all that it's also

3049.38 --> 3051.7400000000002
just

3052.2 --> 3057.2
how certain muscles compose themselves

3054.72 --> 3057.2
and

3058.14 --> 3062.8799999999997
and like tensions tensions that suddenly

3061.619 --> 3065.54
need to

3062.88 --> 3065.54
find

3066.18 --> 3069.5589999999997
release or connection

3070.619 --> 3075.619
and I got it like I got it like at my

3073.26 --> 3075.619
shoulders

3075.78 --> 3082.02
it's very odd because that usually

3078.54 --> 3083.819
usually it's like more uh my lower neck

3082.02 --> 3086.9
or something like between my shoulders

3083.819 --> 3086.9
but now it's like at

3088.2 --> 3092.819
around here

3090.72 --> 3096.2999999999997
it's unusual

3092.819 --> 3098.64
but I feel like it's typically spring

3096.3 --> 3101.6400000000003
and then when I actually massaged it and

3098.64 --> 3105.9
like magnetize it a bit there's like a

3101.64 --> 3108.98
lot of like raw tension that just like

3105.9 --> 3108.98
absolutely like

3109.38 --> 3118.079
things happen energy wise feeling wise

3114.14 --> 3120.7999999999997
like relating to nerves in the body

3118.079 --> 3120.8
pretty sure

3124.92 --> 3127.92
trt

3128.04 --> 3131.96
I have no idea what you're talking about

3148.92 --> 3157.859
that's true oh that huh

3152.94 --> 3161.52
no I don't think I'll go for that just

3157.859 --> 3162.48
yet but I I take care of my testosterone

3161.52 --> 3163.92
though I

3162.48 --> 3166.819
there's all kinds of things like

3163.92 --> 3166.819
ashwagandha

3167.7 --> 3172.68
and other stuff I eat a lot of raw

3170.16 --> 3176.5789999999997
onions these days actually

3172.68 --> 3180.1189999999997
not just like bite from but like with my

3176.579 --> 3183.02
French fries I like cut onions and

3180.119 --> 3183.02
that's actually good

3184.559 --> 3191.46
so I I feel like I am

3187.26 --> 3193.92
keeping tabs on my testosterone through

3191.46 --> 3197.96
what the foods that I eat

3193.92 --> 3197.96
avoid soaring all that also

3199.859 --> 3203.72
but I'm not like literally gonna

3203.88 --> 3209.6600000000003
Overkill it

3205.74 --> 3209.66
I still feel I have plenty

3252.079 --> 3258.0
all right but dude I'll I'll concern

3255.78 --> 3260.28
myself with things like that again when

3258.0 --> 3263.76
I have proper pants

3260.28 --> 3265.6800000000003
when I can be in a game in the game

3263.76 --> 3269.0400000000004
again you know I'm not gonna be

3265.68 --> 3270.96
concerned about all that too much

3269.04 --> 3273.18
except for like how stable I can

3270.96 --> 3275.64
function and all that

3273.18 --> 3279.319
I mean a real shortage of testosterone

3275.64 --> 3279.319
will like make you depressed

3279.359 --> 3284.04
doesn't matter

3281.579 --> 3286.2200000000003
so in that sense I take care of it but I

3284.04 --> 3286.22
mean

3301.14 --> 3304.14
foreign

3334.5 --> 3336.74
foreign

3355.68 --> 3358.68
related

3378.599 --> 3383.94

by the way I haven't seen her in a while

3383.94 --> 3387.14
I wonder what's going on

3403.02 --> 3409.2
I haven't seen Julio paben

3405.839 --> 3413.0

3414.3 --> 3417.8
or taking a break

3418.859 --> 3422.42
she wasn't fpd oh okay

3423.119 --> 3430.319

3426.42 --> 3434.2400000000002
up as early as she is now or as she was

3430.319 --> 3434.24
maybe she's not able to

3434.579 --> 3440.119
I mean

3436.02 --> 3440.119
my show is really early to her

3476.22 --> 3479.22

or are people stopping by to debate

3597.66 --> 3606.0589999999997
well FD is still doing the videos but if

3601.2 --> 3608.52
somebody comes by as a baller to debate

3606.059 --> 3610.8590000000004
then I'm pretty sure that Nathan will

3608.52 --> 3614.839
give them the room

3610.859 --> 3614.839
to do that or attempt that

3616.079 --> 3622.76
so even like are you planning to

3619.079 --> 3622.76
stop by and debate

3624.599 --> 3629.6400000000003
wait if a nightmare why don't you go on

3627.059 --> 3632.46
Discord

3629.64 --> 3634.859
uh just join them and maybe you could

3632.46 --> 3636.98
make your case on how the Earth is a

3634.859 --> 3636.98
ball

3637.2 --> 3641.18
you're not allowed right

3642.96 --> 3645.7400000000002

why not

3655.98 --> 3662.48

really

3668.64 --> 3673.5
okay

3671.22 --> 3676.8799999999997
I guess I'll have to have a talk then

3673.5 --> 3676.88
with Nathan about that

3687.059 --> 3691.7000000000003
for what

3688.44 --> 3691.7000000000003
what the hell did you do

3695.579 --> 3700.4
that you just rump us the [ __ ] out of

3697.68 --> 3700.3999999999996
people or something

3701.059 --> 3707.299

going on here

3708.12 --> 3711.25
[Music]

3740.04 --> 3745.859
okay that's funny but I don't see how

that is Gonna Get You blocked like

3745.859 --> 3750.359
who the [ __ ] gives a [ __ ] about somebody

3748.02 --> 3752.52
being contradictory

3750.359 --> 3754.2
that's how is that a reason to block

3752.52 --> 3757.22
anybody

3754.2 --> 3757.22
it's ridiculous

3757.859 --> 3762.74
are you sure that that is exactly the

3760.5 --> 3762.74
reason

3762.9 --> 3767.339
for being contradictory like I've never

3765.42 --> 3769.619
heard of that oh you're contradicting

3767.339 --> 3774.0789999999997
yourself so that's

3769.619 --> 3774.079
means you're kicked out what

3783.599 --> 3786.319
all right

3787.079 --> 3791.1800000000003
okay I'll I'll bring it up

3792.42 --> 3798.44
I'll bring it up straight out

3795.0 --> 3798.44
on the Flat Earth debate later

3812.66 --> 3817.2
righteous Forest is a creepy little

3815.46 --> 3819.299
gatekeeper I don't know what the [ __ ]

3817.2 --> 3821.7599999999998
you think he's doing

3819.299 --> 3823.98
but I literally don't trust his motives

3821.76 --> 3828.0200000000004
I'm not the first one by the way

3823.98 --> 3828.02
to have that but it's getting worse

3829.799 --> 3836.16
he literally removed my links My Links

3833.04 --> 3837.42
of like a manifested letter debate

3836.16 --> 3839.8799999999997
panelist

3837.42 --> 3843.9
to my own website

3839.88 --> 3846.839
why because it was dark

3843.9 --> 3850.859
and then I asked what about it was dark

3846.839 --> 3854.339
and he refused to answer

3850.859 --> 3856.859
the guy is a censoring gatekeeping dick

3854.339 --> 3860.0589999999997
and I don't even understand the reasons

3856.859 --> 3860.0589999999997
as to why he does it

3863.819 --> 3869.4
yeah he thought that my

3865.819 --> 3871.7599999999998
symbolics.nl website that that was too

3869.4 --> 3871.76
dark

3872.52 --> 3876.48
it's really oh my God my symbolics at an

3875.4 --> 3881.1600000000003
l

3876.48 --> 3887.819
since 2006 so freaking dark man I mean

3881.16 --> 3890.2799999999997
it's evil right so freaking evil man

3887.819 --> 3893.64
it's like it's too dark man this website

3890.28 --> 3896.28
I mean if you post this on Discord he

3893.64 --> 3901.04
has to remove it otherwise Discord might

3896.28 --> 3901.0400000000004
be in trouble because it's so dark

3903.78 --> 3910.02
the [ __ ] man

3906.72 --> 3912.859
just check out that and and tell me it's

3910.02 --> 3912.859
too dark

3913.5 --> 3921.059
like it's evil or something

3917.46 --> 3923.339
very dangerous

3921.059 --> 3925.799
like if you read that all your life's

3923.339 --> 3928.98
gonna be ruined forever it's so dark man

3925.799 --> 3932.579
you have nightmares of the what the [ __ ]

3928.98 --> 3935.22
I I don't know I can't stand the the guy

3932.579 --> 3938.059
and he's a gatekeeping dick and I don't

3935.22 --> 3938.0589999999997
know why he does it

3938.7 --> 3942.68
seems like a gatekeeping dick

3944.46 --> 3946.46
um

3959.04 --> 3964.14
you won't believe me yeah all right

3961.92 --> 3966.299
that's all just a bunch of blabbermouth

3964.14 --> 3969.0
excuses if people don't go on that

3966.299 --> 3970.619
because of Nathan they're just chicken

3969.0 --> 3972.66
[ __ ]

3970.619 --> 3974.6400000000003
right but that's not what we're talking

3972.66 --> 3976.98
about we're talking about a baller that

3974.64 --> 3978.54
would like to have a conversation make a

3976.98 --> 3982.339
case for the ball

3978.54 --> 3986.52
that's being kicked out for

3982.339 --> 3989.52
allegedly contradicting himself

3986.52 --> 3989.52
foreign

3990.96 --> 3996.18
that makes no freaking sense

3993.9 --> 3997.38
somebody's gatekeeping

3996.18 --> 4001.2799999999997
there

3997.38 --> 4004.46
like keeping the Ballers off

4001.28 --> 4005.7200000000003
the show effectively if they can't they

4004.46 --> 4007.819
want to be part of it and they can't

4005.72 --> 4009.5
yeah

4007.819 --> 4012.079
that's bad

4009.5 --> 4014.539
write this for us yeah

4012.079 --> 4016.1600000000003

4018.2 --> 4023.5989999999997

4021.38 --> 4026.7200000000003

4028.46 --> 4032.96
gatekeepish

4030.619 --> 4036.1400000000003
and you're not

4032.96 --> 4039.2200000000003
overt about

4036.14 --> 4039.22
your motivations

4041.66 --> 4046.0389999999998
I don't trust you

4043.22 --> 4047.839
I don't think you should be there

4046.039 --> 4051.44
I don't think you should have the power

4047.839 --> 4053.18
to kick anybody out or delete anything

4051.44 --> 4055.88
you should have the power to mute

4053.18 --> 4060.22
somebody at best

4055.88 --> 4060.2200000000003
and that should be it yeah

4065.299 --> 4068.98
talking to righteous Force

4072.7 --> 4078.2599999999998
yeah I get it hey you as a moderator

4080.299 --> 4085.4
like yeah sure this is just a basic

4082.039 --> 4087.7990000000004
moderate you should not be able to kick

people out

4087.799 --> 4092.24
right just for us and you should not be

4089.78 --> 4093.7400000000002

4587.199 --> 4592.94
the moderation just is not working

4590.3 --> 4596.92
anymore but I don't know if it's just my

4592.94 --> 4596.919999999999
Channel or if it's all of YouTube

4597.739 --> 4603.5199999999995
and there's no other live stream I can

4600.44 --> 4603.5199999999995
see right now

4605.659 --> 4608.86
in order to check

4615.71 --> 4624.109
[Music]

4627.82 --> 4631.0
thank you

4632.96 --> 4640.9
probably just a glitch yeah maybe but

4637.04 --> 4640.9
it was just really unexpected

4644.0 --> 4646.9
foreign

4706.64 --> 4712.1
interesting background noise yeah this

4709.04 --> 4713.719
there's work being done outside

4712.1 --> 4715.52
yeah

4713.719 --> 4719.06
they're like

4715.52 --> 4720.8
making a floor there is some I think

4719.06 --> 4723.1990000000005
some kind of concrete pouring had

4720.8 --> 4725.900000000001
happened and they're working on it a bit

4723.199 --> 4727.699
and there's a tree cutter cutting

4725.9 --> 4731.92
operation

4727.699 --> 4731.919999999999
to trim the trees out there

4748.34 --> 4751.719
tree surgeons right

4767.42 --> 4772.82
it's somebody gonna give me a rogans up

4770.3 --> 4774.679
on the show already it just it's set to

4772.82 --> 4776.42
one

4774.679 --> 4779.38
what is this

4776.42 --> 4779.38
come on guys

4780.8 --> 4786.08
what are the topics today not a wide

4784.04 --> 4787.94
variety of topics steamy traveler it's

4786.08 --> 4790.88
just it's beautiful weather taking it

4787.94 --> 4793.4
easy gonna vote later today

4790.88 --> 4795.400000000001
the provincial States

4793.4 --> 4798.259999999999
and

4795.4 --> 4801.699
there's work being done outside and

4798.26 --> 4801.6990000000005
chocolate saying

4801.88 --> 4806.84
there's an emergency fund run going for

4805.219 --> 4809.02
chocolate saying because he really needs

4806.84 --> 4809.02
it

4812.06 --> 4817.64
that's about it

4814.94 --> 4821.239
for the rest I I feel I really do feel

4817.64 --> 4823.9400000000005
like super laid back I mean

4821.239 --> 4826.459999999999
it was kind of uneasy yesterday but I

4823.94 --> 4828.379999999999
took a shower I didn't go to bed too

4826.46 --> 4830.3
late

4828.38 --> 4832.78
and it's beautiful weather today so I

4830.3 --> 4832.78
feel great

4834.4 --> 4838.46
but like

4836.179 --> 4841.34
I'm kind of like

4838.46 --> 4843.02
not I'm not hyperactive or Restless or

4841.34 --> 4845.179
anything I'm just really kind of laid

4843.02 --> 4849.860000000001
back today so

4845.179 --> 4849.86
yeah cool on my audio no

4850.64 --> 4853.659000000001
that's impossible

4857.12 --> 4860.8
that's probably your setup

4877.04 --> 4880.48
yeah it's just a troll

4881.239 --> 4884.86
and now I can lock them

4886.4 --> 4891.219
oh you're in okay fine not a troll

4909.04 --> 4914.36
maybe there's an operation going on with

4912.98 --> 4918.379999999999
you too

4914.36 --> 4921.259999999999
maybe they've disabled all moderation to

4918.38 --> 4923.4800000000005
allow some kind of online activity maybe

4921.26 --> 4926.2390000000005
there's like rushes now happening

4923.48 --> 4928.28
politically as in part of the operation

4926.239 --> 4930.62
to try to quickly mind control everybody

4928.28 --> 4933.4
to still vote on their side or something

4930.62 --> 4935.96
I've seen a lot of like political

4933.4 --> 4939.099999999999
advertisements like all the ads that I

4935.96 --> 4944.179
have been seeing on YouTube since

4939.1 --> 4946.52
uh since Monday have all been political

4944.179 --> 4949.1
for political parties and all that so

4946.52 --> 4951.56
maybe that's why moderation is just

4949.1 --> 4955.6
universally disabled in the Netherlands

4951.56 --> 4955.6
but that makes no sense that

4956.239 --> 4960.879999999999
it's not just but like the entire world

4962.06 --> 4968.6
nah it's it's probably just a glitch

4965.719 --> 4971.62
but like what a weird timing for the

4968.6 --> 4971.620000000001
glitch though

4980.96 --> 4985.159
do doubt it's a glitch

4983.42 --> 4990.76
well

4985.159 --> 4990.759999999999
really so they do turn it off moderation

4991.76 --> 4995.54
took yeah but too coincidental for what

4994.46 --> 4999.32
I mean

4995.54 --> 5003.5199999999995
today is Dutch

4999.32 --> 5006.5199999999995
you know it's it's like the the Dutch uh

5003.52 --> 5008.679
election day basically

5006.52 --> 5010.02
it's only in the Netherlands like how

5008.679 --> 5012.9400000000005
would

5010.02 --> 5015.9400000000005
entire YouTube you say

5012.94 --> 5018.699
like the entirety would turn off

5015.94 --> 5021.94
moderation ability

5018.699 --> 5024.46
just for the Netherlands really

5021.94 --> 5028.199
you you really think that they the

5024.46 --> 5028.199
entirety of YouTube would just like

5028.36 --> 5033.28
turn off the moderation we'll just say

5030.58 --> 5036.88
it's a bug on the entirety of YouTube

5033.28 --> 5039.54
because of provincial State voting in

5036.88 --> 5039.54
the Netherlands

5039.88 --> 5044.56
I mean if there was like a whole Cascade

5042.76 --> 5046.179
of different things right happening

5044.56 --> 5048.580000000001
right now

5046.179 --> 5050.62
like other votes happening all at the

5048.58 --> 5054.159
same time or some really important thing

5050.62 --> 5057.64
rolling out right now then I get it

5054.159 --> 5061.44
but just for the Dutch provincial states

5057.64 --> 5061.4400000000005
that seems completely insane

5065.679 --> 5070.659
the fpd will be full of loans today if

5068.32 --> 5072.88
this get me

5070.659 --> 5075.239
how is that different from any other day

5072.88 --> 5075.2390000000005
Oz

5076.6 --> 5081.3
have you seen the ball Tarts that hang

5078.76 --> 5081.3
around there

5120.659 --> 5125.04
blocking isn't even an option

5125.26 --> 5131.9400000000005
where is the block option you can't even

5128.38 --> 5131.9400000000005
select to block anything

5133.0 --> 5136.199
what is this

5149.739 --> 5152.699
you got blocked

5152.739 --> 5157.36
in

5154.239 --> 5162.299999999999
okay so what the [ __ ] is going on

5157.36 --> 5162.299999999999
what the [ __ ] is going on YouTube

5163.3 --> 5169.2390000000005
I want I want answers why is my

5166.9 --> 5171.46
moderation not working

5169.239 --> 5173.759999999999
how the [ __ ] can that even be possible

5171.46 --> 5173.76
then

5183.58 --> 5187.679
what the hell is going on

5191.98 --> 5196.78
who am I trying to block

5193.96 --> 5199.54
I I can't moderate

5196.78 --> 5200.86
steamage I can't even block trolls in

5199.54 --> 5204.28
chat like

5200.86 --> 5208.12
not to hide them but to literally block

5204.28 --> 5212.639
them to my account I can't do that now

5208.12 --> 5212.639
what the [ __ ] is this

5221.94 --> 5227.379999999999
yeah but

5223.719 --> 5229.719
okay so that that's a hack then it can't

5227.38 --> 5232.86
be a hack of my account that makes

5229.719 --> 5232.86
absolutely no sense

5233.86 --> 5239.98
has nothing to do with that

5236.86 --> 5245.219
who the [ __ ] is literally hacking

5239.98 --> 5245.218999999999
YouTube itself to do this then

5257.739 --> 5260.339999999999
foreign

5262.679 --> 5269.92
I'd like to give you a strong warning uh

5267.219 --> 5271.12

5269.92 --> 5275.4400000000005

by trolls YouTube YouTube your main

5275.44 --> 5282.638999999999

5279.1 --> 5285.6990000000005
bunch of [ __ ] trolls okay and they've

5282.639 --> 5290.82
just locally disabled moderation

5285.699 --> 5290.82
function here what the [ __ ] is this

5296.679 --> 5301.139
you need to restart just be fine

5301.42 --> 5304.1990000000005
really

5327.34 --> 5333.46
