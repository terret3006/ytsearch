1.25 --> 8.55
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

5.339 --> 12.54
weird number 45 I'm your host

8.55 --> 15.559000000000001
Arwen and today the weather is pretty

12.54 --> 15.559
much the same as yesterday

15.949 --> 28.740000000000002
not as rainy I yeah I have a new option

25.5 --> 37.13
in the description below you paid some

28.74 --> 37.129999999999995
attention on recommendation of ranty I

37.46 --> 48.149
decided to make my my PayPal account

41.84 --> 50.969
public so yeah if for a while I'm not

48.149 --> 54.42
gonna be at the thousand subscribers so

50.969 --> 58.68
that's an alternative way to donate

54.42 --> 62.910000000000004
contribute whatever you seem fit for all

58.68 --> 67.89
my effort so far and maybe you would

62.91 --> 68.07
like me to buy some new clothes so would

67.89 --> 72.57
I

68.07 --> 75.13999999999999
so yeah it's another option it's out

72.57 --> 80.30999999999999
there pretty nervous about doing that

75.14 --> 84.36
but it's I'm not forcing anyone to do

80.31 --> 85.14
anything it's all up to you and we'll

84.36 --> 90.18
see where it goes

85.14 --> 92.61
in the meantime yeah please do subscribe

90.18 --> 95.549
to my channel if you haven't already if

92.61 --> 100.38
you're seeing this for the first time I

95.549 --> 105.36000000000001
have this show daily and I take panel

100.38 --> 109.079
members for now through Skype but since

105.36 --> 112.5
I am in the works of free formatting the

109.079 --> 117.75
show using OBS I will eventually be able

112.5 --> 121.28
to have a more open panel with

117.75 --> 125.49
potentially more risky panel members

121.28 --> 127.38
without actually having that risk so

125.49 --> 131.03
yeah the show will only get more

127.38 --> 134.2
interesting there will also be an intro

131.03 --> 139.89
as part of that

134.2 --> 139.89
so yeah let's see where this goes

143.1 --> 151.75
what has been going on mm-hmm seems

148.92 --> 155.70999999999998
everybody still asleep must have had a

151.75 --> 163.72
long party nice because I only see here

155.71 --> 168.60000000000002
for now in chat oh okay there are 10

163.72 --> 168.6
watching so hello out there

176.27 --> 183.47
man there's been a lot of activity but

179.24 --> 185.36
yeah I I was kind of disengaged most of

183.47 --> 192.14
the day yesterday had a good talk with

185.36 --> 193.67000000000002
Rasta but things over Skype and and the

192.14 --> 195.64999999999998
hangouts of course but yeah I noticed

193.67 --> 203.39
that afterward a lot of stuff happened

195.65 --> 205.97
like iron rail media had at a second

203.39 --> 208.13
part of the Martin littke interview on

205.97 --> 217.57999999999998
Iron Works haven't had a glance at that

208.13 --> 219.71
yet could be interesting ballers are

217.58 --> 221.51000000000002
doing what they're doing I mean yeah

219.71 --> 224.21
these days I'm subscribed to Tim's

221.51 --> 227.23999999999998
channel not because I think he's such a

224.21 --> 230.54000000000002
great guy but because he does have some

227.24 --> 232.88
interesting hangouts here and there but

230.54 --> 238.35999999999999
yes still most of his videos are just

232.88 --> 238.35999999999999
the typical crap not very interesting

238.48 --> 245.45
but yeah waiting for those moments and

241.25 --> 251.56
that least he does take real panel

245.45 --> 251.56
members on so I am available for that

252.52 --> 258.85900000000004
might even mirror some of them if

255.14 --> 261.89
they're really exceptionally good with

258.859 --> 264.5
his permission or maybe without I don't

261.89 --> 267.86
know part of it so I should be able to

264.5 --> 273.32
put it on my channel uh-huh what else

267.86 --> 278.81
was going on yeah Nathan didn't have his

273.32 --> 280.4
hangout that was really weird it didn't

278.81 --> 287.27
show up didn't say anything he's still

280.4 --> 291.38
out here yeah Adam yeah sorry about that

287.27 --> 292.76
look I was just totally exhausted

291.38 --> 300.29
yesterday it's weird

292.76 --> 302.48
I think it's routed in nervousness for

300.29 --> 306.38
engaging in new stuff it's a very

302.48 --> 307.8
annoying side effect that I typically

306.38 --> 317.86
have

307.8 --> 322.15000000000003
that's also why I tend to not have a lot

317.86 --> 324.309
of rapid changes around me why thinks

322.15 --> 326.789
why I always look the same why my room

324.309 --> 329.199
tip typically always looks the same

326.789 --> 331.33
because I don't like changes a lot and

329.199 --> 334.229
every time I do it even if I am very

331.33 --> 337.539
enthusiastic about I get very nervous

334.229 --> 340.33
sometimes resulting in nausea or in

337.539 --> 343.449
fatigue it's very annoying it's very

340.33 --> 346.21
disruptive from the inside and I just

343.449 --> 351.24
need to get over it takes a while and I

346.21 --> 351.23999999999995
think I'm gonna be more focused today

356.72 --> 362.84000000000003
all right yep Friday I look Friday

360.49 --> 365.66
yeah parents a lot of people have tried

362.84 --> 368.0
to contact me but I said very clearly on

365.66 --> 371.26000000000005
the early bird show in the morning that

368.0 --> 375.86
I was gonna have a gamer night so yeah

371.26 --> 379.03999999999996
I'm not at my computer and not reach of

375.86 --> 382.16
my phone during that completely so I can

379.04 --> 384.83000000000004
completely focus on the game and I

382.16 --> 388.25
demand my players do the same I will not

384.83 --> 389.87
have them chatting on their mobile

388.25 --> 392.8
during the game like if they're gonna do

389.87 --> 396.2
that I'm gonna get really pissed off I

392.8 --> 398.35
hate when people do that the indie

396.2 --> 401.0
really does require all attention and

398.35 --> 403.82000000000005
you already get dragged off into silly

401.0 --> 406.16
conversations just talking with one

403.82 --> 407.84
another so you don't need people on

406.16 --> 413.09000000000003
there staring into their mobile not

407.84 --> 416.78
paying attention on top of that but yeah

413.09 --> 421.96
I wasn't I wasn't in behind my computer

416.78 --> 421.96
at most of the Friday evening and night

422.5 --> 429.85
I will be here today most of the day and

431.08 --> 437.18
yeah the earlier the better because as

434.45 --> 442.21999999999997
soon as the evening starts to hit that's

437.18 --> 444.47
when I just really wonder off like my

442.22 --> 453.46000000000004
best active moments are during the day

444.47 --> 457.69000000000005
lights always so anyway welcome ultra

453.46 --> 457.69
Jack and of course

462.19 --> 465.82
what's happening

483.08 --> 488.87
I guess because of the typical winter

487.099 --> 495.59
thing there's a lot of friction going

488.87 --> 499.159
around I think people that are silly act

495.59 --> 501.58
more silly and people that are

499.159 --> 508.659
inquisitive are more inquisitive and

501.58 --> 508.659
people that gossip gossip even worse I

508.9 --> 516.519
think really that's mostly what's going

511.61 --> 516.519
on with so much friction

524.94 --> 531.7800000000001
but yeah man I let's just say I've been

527.97 --> 534.6
hearing some really weird rumors that I

531.78 --> 545.4
don't care to elaborate on we'll see

534.6 --> 548.85
where that goes and yeah I didn't really

545.4 --> 550.74
don't know what to say about it except

548.85 --> 553.86
that I'm pretty sure that I don't want

550.74 --> 563.67
to be the person throwing this out there

553.86 --> 572.73
I don't know any first-hand information

563.67 --> 575.91
about it anyway but oh god yeah I heard

572.73 --> 580.01
something going on with John from blow

575.91 --> 584.1
Buster's apparently some debacle with

580.01 --> 587.64
with his ex-wife or something caused him

584.1 --> 589.59
to now get into trouble with the law or

587.64 --> 594.51
something that was weird

589.59 --> 600.1800000000001
pretty freaky very annoying for him and

594.51 --> 602.79
for everybody else so yeah I don't know

600.18 --> 605.76
the details of it again just rumors

602.79 --> 608.18
heard through a Skype chat that that was

605.76 --> 608.18
going on

616.83 --> 619.5200000000001
oh [ __ ]

621.009 --> 636.369
well I don't know Eric I don't know

625.66 --> 636.3689999999999
maybe that's true I don't know I guess

638.559 --> 644.419
they I don't see John as the type but

641.569 --> 648.889
you know he may have went through some

644.419 --> 654.639
dark period in his life to go there does

648.889 --> 656.419
it looks like he got over it you know

654.639 --> 667.609
hello Tony

656.419 --> 670.449
V in check and went James right okay

667.609 --> 674.4490000000001
wind James that makes a lot of sense cuz

670.449 --> 679.459
that kind of [ __ ] happened even at my

674.449 --> 685.639
home like my dad and my mom used to yell

679.459 --> 688.9989999999999
a lot and eventually me and my mom as

685.639 --> 693.019
well cuz when she went nuts and started

688.999 --> 694.879
to see me like my dad so yeah we did

693.019 --> 697.85
have a lot of complaints from neighbors

694.879 --> 703.089
at times for being way too loud but

697.85 --> 707.66
never any physical violence like almost

703.089 --> 710.8090000000001
between my mom my dad but like not

707.66 --> 714.35
really letting it get that far but yeah

710.809 --> 715.9699999999999
high ten [ __ ] and loud so yeah look a

714.35 --> 719.3290000000001
lot of people have these kinds of

715.97 --> 723.589
relations yeah there are several types

719.329 --> 726.8589999999999
of relation structures and the ones that

723.589 --> 729.4100000000001
are typically passion based where the

726.859 --> 732.23
love comes from the passion yeah those

729.41 --> 737.289
are the ones that tend to like get in

732.23 --> 740.119
these personal psychological fights

737.289 --> 742.819
that's what my mom and my dad had as

740.119 --> 744.799
well and they eventually even hated that

742.819 --> 748.549
but they couldn't step away from it

744.799 --> 750.799
anymore they got like neurotic about it

748.549 --> 752.66
and a lot of people have that in real in

750.799 --> 755.9599999999999
in these types of relief

752.66 --> 759.1999999999999
when they all on for too long

755.96 --> 761.9300000000001
and they can go nuts by them so yeah I

759.2 --> 766.61
don't see that as an evil thing I just

761.93 --> 770.9
see this a very hard life lesson and can

766.61 --> 774.41
mess you up you know what you can still

770.9 --> 776.87
recover from it are you that depends on

774.41 --> 781.27
the angle would die from it and my

776.87 --> 786.71
mother but my dad yeah he got better and

781.27 --> 788.99
you can in his essence there's no more

786.71 --> 791.48
remnants of what happened before except

788.99 --> 794.45
the memory of it and it has all calmed

791.48 --> 797.51
down it is all into place he really got

794.45 --> 797.87
over it so yeah it can can also destroy

797.51 --> 800.42
you

797.87 --> 809.35
just keep that in mind it's not an evil

800.42 --> 814.81
thing it is really a social and identity

809.35 --> 819.32
related thing I think it's it's complex

814.81 --> 821.53
relations anything's in if some kind of

819.32 --> 826.34
relation out there can be complex it is

821.53 --> 829.9399999999999
an actual love relationship every

826.34 --> 831.38
everyone that had has has had one that

829.94 --> 837.35
was serious where they were in love

831.38 --> 842.81
knows that to be true anyway yeah sad to

837.35 --> 844.88
hear about John I hope now that he's

842.81 --> 846.9799999999999
being forced to deal with this because

844.88 --> 849.68
apparently he didn't you just put it

846.98 --> 851.36
away or a long time I had and I hope

849.68 --> 856.01
that in being forced to deal with this

851.36 --> 859.22
he will actually be ready and grow into

856.01 --> 862.28
it and deal with it and maybe get some

859.22 --> 863.84
help from good friends here because I

862.28 --> 865.76
don't think anybody's gonna blame him

863.84 --> 866.21
for having a bad relationship in the

865.76 --> 870.4399999999999
past

866.21 --> 874.25
really so not the ones that are not

870.44 --> 876.8800000000001
people that a reasonable way so yeah

874.25 --> 876.88
that happened

887.55 --> 896.5799999999999
yo yeah yeah true Eric at least in

891.93 --> 897.26
America with domestic [ __ ] don't call

896.58 --> 899.37
the cops

897.26 --> 901.71
depending on the region that can even be

899.37 --> 904.62
extremely dangerous in the Netherlands

901.71 --> 908.2800000000001
is different look the police here are

904.62 --> 911.16
totally gentle and responding to

908.28 --> 913.62
domestic issues is the primary function

911.16 --> 915.66
that they have so they are they have the

913.62 --> 919.92
skills really to do with this never

915.66 --> 923.4599999999999
violent always very well prepared so

919.92 --> 926.28
very well registered this [ __ ] happens

923.46 --> 929.4000000000001
they know where these domestic things

926.28 --> 934.29
happen what couples where typically and

929.4 --> 936.09
how but yeah in the Netherlands calling

934.29 --> 943.29
the cops for such a thing is not that

936.09 --> 947.46
uncommon in America don't do that

943.29 --> 949.68
it's just unless you'd like wanna play

947.46 --> 952.98
Russian roulette as it were you don't

949.68 --> 955.4
want to do that just gotta solve it

952.98 --> 955.4
yourself

959.46 --> 967.35
it's probably better to get a reliable

962.58 --> 971.97
friend in on the help that can handle

967.35 --> 973.52
very tense situations rather than just

971.97 --> 978.0500000000001
calling the cops

973.52 --> 981.24
well unless you personally know cops

978.05 --> 984.5699999999999
that know you like you have a friend you

981.24 --> 986.76
happen to have a friend that that you

984.57 --> 988.32
know is reliable but if you don't know

986.76 --> 991.53
the cups and you have a domestic

988.32 --> 994.62
situation then don't just call the cops

991.53 --> 997.74
in America specifically I don't

994.62 --> 1000.88
recommend it you know for so many

997.74 --> 1010.55
terrible stories of what could unfold

1000.88 --> 1017.23
from that yeah yeah Eric I unfortunately

1010.55 --> 1021.8
agree with you it's just it's the policy

1017.23 --> 1025.22
America has many states in America still

1021.8 --> 1026.18
have terrible should first ask questions

1025.22 --> 1030.47
later

1026.18 --> 1033.68
policy that stem from the think that the

1030.47 --> 1035.709
bush but also the Obama era where that

1033.68 --> 1041.1200000000001
started to get implemented everywhere

1035.709 --> 1045.02
some of it didn't but yeah it's terrible

1041.12 --> 1047.4199999999998
and since that happened like yeah this

1045.02 --> 1051.5
kind of [ __ ] is happening totally

1047.42 --> 1053.8700000000001
unnecessary and yeah thank God in the

1051.5 --> 1055.61
Netherlands that does not happen the

1053.87 --> 1058.9699999999998
problems we have here is rather than

1055.61 --> 1062.06
Takumi Z is sometimes a little bit

1058.97 --> 1065.27
cowardice but yeah also because the

1062.06 --> 1068.69
rules are just so restrictive they're

1065.27 --> 1072.71
just like if you want to fix a situation

1068.69 --> 1074.75
quickly then there's so much trouble we

1072.71 --> 1076.49
have to deal with afterwards in so many

1074.75 --> 1079.13
cases so yeah and the other hand you

1076.49 --> 1082.97
can't really blame them for being overly

1079.13 --> 1084.49
careful because of the rules but yeah at

1082.97 --> 1087.92
least

1084.49 --> 1091.4
yeah there's no like police shooting

1087.92 --> 1092.96
people if that happens it's like a shock

1091.4 --> 1098.5
to everyone

1092.96 --> 1100.82
and well sometimes criminal shootouts

1098.5 --> 1104.47
happen and then the police do shoot

1100.82 --> 1108.83
these people so they're not completely

1104.47 --> 1115.01
incompetent but it does happen a

1108.83 --> 1121.549
specific type of regions but I guess in

1115.01 --> 1125.21
bigger cities but overall yeah the

1121.549 --> 1127.73
police here are still peace officers and

1125.21 --> 1132.89
I'm quite satisfied about them although

1127.73 --> 1136.72
I do worry that they might be under

1132.89 --> 1142.51
certain circumstances just turn into

1136.72 --> 1146.659
peons to powerful groups because that

1142.51 --> 1149.899
that might happen I'm nervous about it

1146.659 --> 1152.1490000000001
I've had weird experiences myself in

1149.899 --> 1156.02
this which I cannot confirm a hundred

1152.149 --> 1159.08
percent to be physically real but yeah

1156.02 --> 1161.0
whatever that is it's something I'm

1159.08 --> 1163.76
nervous about like I'm not gonna just

1161.0 --> 1165.399
blindly trust police because they wear

1163.76 --> 1170.4089999999999
uniforms I'm not gonna necessarily

1165.399 --> 1173.62
expect to be in session undercover but

1170.409 --> 1176.779
yeah they may unwittingly just be

1173.62 --> 1181.9699999999998
ordered to be guards for a nefarious

1176.779 --> 1188.659
group for example you know I keep that

1181.97 --> 1191.14
in the back of my mind so yeah I don't

1188.659 --> 1194.5700000000002
blindly trust police never really have

1191.14 --> 1197.929
but I do recognize just from seeing the

1194.57 --> 1200.6
action seeing everything surrounding

1197.929 --> 1206.73
them that most cops are just really good

1200.6 --> 1207.9399999999998
guys that are under a lot of stress from

1206.73 --> 1215.09
[Music]

1207.94 --> 1219.3500000000001
having to basically cage their spirit in

1215.09 --> 1222.08
these very rigid rules in this large

1219.35 --> 1225.11
system of rules it's very tough to do

1222.08 --> 1226.789
that and they really have to be able to

1225.11 --> 1230.7489999999998
do it well even to be a

1226.789 --> 1233.179
most of them so cops are disciplined

1230.749 --> 1238.969
that is absolutely a fact here they're

1233.179 --> 1242.709
very disciplined all of them and yeah

1238.969 --> 1247.5700000000002
that's good I'm pretty satisfied but

1242.709 --> 1247.5700000000002
yeah it's not perfect anyway

1252.73 --> 1264.94
yeah might sound a little autocratic or

1260.62 --> 1270.1899999999998
statist but yeah cops here do make me

1264.94 --> 1274.15
feel safe in contrast to cops in the

1270.19 --> 1276.54
United States I can imagine that nobody

1274.15 --> 1278.17
really feels safe when cops are around

1276.54 --> 1280.3
after everything that's happened

1278.17 --> 1282.79
although maybe you might know these cups

1280.3 --> 1285.82
and then no okay these are okay they're

1282.79 --> 1288.22
not gonna do that crazy [ __ ] but yeah

1285.82 --> 1297.97
still crazy stuff happens over there

1288.22 --> 1302.1200000000001
here no no Geoffrey bail by the way and

1297.97 --> 1305.17
Ezra they agreed

1302.12 --> 1305.1699999999998
[Music]

1319.56 --> 1329.81
right okay bkk dave yeah

1325.17 --> 1333.03
Freemasonry I do believe that

1329.81 --> 1335.61
Freemasonry is very interwoven with the

1333.03 --> 1338.01
police system and I do believe that many

1335.61 --> 1344.25
police officers also in the Netherlands

1338.01 --> 1349.22
are freemasons but that does not make

1344.25 --> 1352.53
them evil by default again however if my

1349.22 --> 1355.38
assumptions in this are correct then yes

1352.53 --> 1358.8
the scenario that I portrayed earlier

1355.38 --> 1362.72
about them unwittingly or at least

1358.8 --> 1367.47
passively working as pawns for

1362.72 --> 1372.1200000000001
potentially nefarious groups is yeah

1367.47 --> 1375.0
that would confirm that a lot because

1372.12 --> 1378.2099999999998
Freemasons do cooperate with secret

1375.0 --> 1384.42
society people in secret service as far

1378.21 --> 1386.52
as I know so yeah that does make it a

1384.42 --> 1389.01
little risky on the other hand are they

1386.52 --> 1393.09
still are they even allowed to do this

1389.01 --> 1396.27
or do they have to be tricked that's

1393.09 --> 1402.4199999999998
that's the big question I think you have

1396.27 --> 1404.76
to be tricked and think that any people

1402.42 --> 1407.28
that will be tricked will probably not

1404.76 --> 1414.57
be like fettering cops unless they are

1407.28 --> 1417.1499999999999
like really hardcore freemasons or

1414.57 --> 1420.03
whatever a part of the group already and

1417.15 --> 1422.43
just undercover as a compass you are

1420.03 --> 1425.37
sitting in that function and others will

1422.43 --> 1428.94
more likely be just really young guys

1425.37 --> 1434.4199999999998
that are just doing as they're being

1428.94 --> 1438.75
told that kind of thing yeah anyway

1434.42 --> 1440.97
can't confirm that having can't confirm

1438.75 --> 1444.12
having experienced that physically yet

1440.97 --> 1445.74
although I I did tell that some time ago

1444.12 --> 1449.09
I did experience this bizarre thing

1445.74 --> 1449.09
about being collected by

1449.86 --> 1454.54
certain individual accompanied by cops

1452.35 --> 1456.6399999999999
and that terrified the [ __ ] out of me at

1454.54 --> 1460.0
that time and in retrospect yeah these

1456.64 --> 1462.76
cops one of them I think even have long

1460.0 --> 1465.4
hair partially long hair and they were

1462.76 --> 1468.09
very young so either they were wearing

1465.4 --> 1470.41
cop outfits or they were like rookies

1468.09 --> 1472.57
didn't really know what they got into it

1470.41 --> 1474.7900000000002
so I don't know what that was I don't

1472.57 --> 1477.52
even know if it was real because it was

1474.79 --> 1479.26
during the dark and that again it's a

1477.52 --> 1481.36
sign that could be pure dark world

1479.26 --> 1485.7
experience and not physically real in

1481.36 --> 1488.37
that sense it's very hard to tell for me

1485.7 --> 1491.95
but yeah I do

1488.37 --> 1495.6999999999998
whether it be real or not it is in the

1491.95 --> 1501.79
back of my mind like it something I need

1495.7 --> 1506.3700000000001
to realize could happen and be as

1501.79 --> 1508.99
prepared for it as I can when it does

1506.37 --> 1512.1399999999999
just to know my options basically

1508.99 --> 1514.929
whenever they are present and I don't

1512.14 --> 1519.46
expect anytime soon anything will happen

1514.929 --> 1522.7
because I am a very very good e to Shu

1519.46 --> 1524.919
citizen although yeah I guess that's

1522.7 --> 1529.5
aside to a wise in the financial

1524.919 --> 1532.419
department I might be seen as a

1529.5 --> 1535.2
dependent on the state and there's not a

1532.419 --> 1540.96
lot of people that have respect for that

1535.2 --> 1543.8500000000001
so that is but yeah as far as like

1540.96 --> 1544.72
criminal things concerned or bad

1543.85 --> 1551.559
behavior

1544.72 --> 1553.45
zero zero clean records and and just me

1551.559 --> 1557.6499999999999
not because I'm afraid but because I

1553.45 --> 1564.63
want to and I'm so glad that I have so

1557.65 --> 1569.67
glad about it so now

1564.63 --> 1571.71
so unless something bizarre happens I'm

1569.67 --> 1578.54
gonna be alright and I'm gonna have to

1571.71 --> 1578.54
rely on that and continue the [ __ ]

1587.419 --> 1590.1090000000002
yeah

1592.43 --> 1609.71
yep cover-ups sure anyway I don't really

1602.93 --> 1613.97
like getting all dark about this kind of

1609.71 --> 1618.22
stuff mad yes eh it's possible still say

1613.97 --> 1620.6000000000001
most of them are just people being

1618.22 --> 1627.8500000000001
manipulated and getting caught up in

1620.6 --> 1627.85
things that they don't really understand

1640.49 --> 1643.18
yeah

1645.51 --> 1656.28
okay no marks my leer

1650.11 --> 1661.81

rules

1894.32 --> 1903.78
don't worry it's gonna be there soon

actually mean what language is that

1954.52 --> 1957.12
yeah

1964.86 --> 1979.57
anyway it seems that at least Nathan is

1975.85 --> 1984.79
going to have hangout today already saw

1979.57 --> 1991.08
him started up so he's probably blob

1984.79 --> 1991.08
probably having a a pre-show right now

2001.56 --> 2009.3
yeah the christmas is almost here

2005.43 --> 2014.25
I guess tomorrow is gonna be the the

2009.3 --> 2015.81
first Christmas Day officially so to

2014.25 --> 2023.58
make sure that I get some groceries

2015.81 --> 2025.6799999999998
today because I like since I first

2023.58 --> 2030.09
started living on my own for some reason

2025.68 --> 2032.94
I always ended up at least one up the

2030.09 --> 2034.98
last few years but every time I always

2032.94 --> 2037.92
ended up forgetting that all the stores

2034.98 --> 2041.67
are closed and then basically had being

2037.92 --> 2043.38
forced to fast the day on Christmas

2041.67 --> 2045.93
it happened so many times this is

2043.38 --> 2053.3
ridiculous but that's not gonna happen

2045.93 --> 2053.3
to me now yeah

2058.35 --> 2066.45
and I'm going to my dad some second

2062.83 --> 2069.869
Christmas Day still gonna have the show

2066.45 --> 2072.669
and then in the evening I'm going there

2069.869 --> 2075.9700000000003
so yeah I am pretty much gonna have an

2072.669 --> 2079.649
show every day without exception evening

2075.97 --> 2083.5899999999997
even during the year change

what I talk about so

2179.19 --> 2196.4700000000003
people in chat flat for life TT Ave

2187.18 --> 2196.47
Maria shag B yeah hello guys welcome

2202.26 --> 2209.5600000000004
yeah yeah I should try to talk about

2206.14 --> 2211.77
Flat Earth stuff more but yeah it's not

2209.56 --> 2214.72
really gonna work out too well unless

2211.77 --> 2217.68
people start asking questions about it

2214.72 --> 2223.24
otherwise yeah it's gonna be cops and

2217.68 --> 2227.41
Freemasons and and people in Flat Earth

2223.24 --> 2228.8489999999997
getting into trouble and ballers getting

2227.41 --> 2231.2799999999997
into trouble because that's what people

2228.849 --> 2233.9700000000003
seems to be talking about pergi fault

2231.28 --> 2233.9700000000003
all the time

2247.29 --> 2254.369
okay that's odd thing to say the word

2250.41 --> 2262.0499999999997
secret means means secrete I don't know

2254.369 --> 2267.3900000000003
about that not too sure I'd have to look

2262.05 --> 2272.76
into the roots of the word where is it

2267.39 --> 2278.96
coming from I don't know if they're

2272.76 --> 2278.96
necessarily the rise from the same root

2295.08 --> 2316.41
mm interesting interesting that makes me

2303.25 --> 2321.12
think are you saying that the concept of

2316.41 --> 2329.95
Santa Claus and bringing secret presents

2321.12 --> 2336.58
is is a repackaging of old pagan

2329.95 --> 2339.0699999999997
priesthood where it would be a gift of

2336.58 --> 2343.83
the goddess or the gods that they would

2339.07 --> 2348.46
present which would be some powerful or

2343.83 --> 2350.3199999999997
magical device that was constructed with

2348.46 --> 2352.18
technology that was obscure to the

2350.32 --> 2354.34
public but that the priests who did have

2352.18 --> 2357.2799999999997
knowledge of think it could there be

2354.34 --> 2358.9300000000003
derived from something like that that is

2357.28 --> 2362.53
very fascinating that's a very

2358.93 --> 2366.39
interesting concept that it would be an

2362.53 --> 2369.07
option to share secret technologies

2366.39 --> 2371.7999999999997
basically giving a cover for where it's

2369.07 --> 2374.0800000000004
coming from and also preventing the

2371.8 --> 2378.57
people from being able to figure out how

2374.08 --> 2383.38
it actually works and just use it it's

2378.57 --> 2389.13
very devious but also very smart and

2383.38 --> 2396.27
yeah it is a typical controller method

2389.13 --> 2399.96
this interesting is very interesting hmm

2396.27 --> 2399.96
thank you for bringing that up

2421.359 --> 2427.259
yeah everything is a cover-up one way or

2425.109 --> 2427.259
the other

2434.9 --> 2443.42
yeah well by the methodology one could

2439.67 --> 2446.53
consider that everything we learned the

2443.42 --> 2451.66
entire foundations of our language and

2446.53 --> 2459.4100000000003
the culture that we've taken on is all

2451.66 --> 2463.7599999999998
layers of deception covering up all

2459.41 --> 2467.06
kinds of unique archaic aspects about

2463.76 --> 2473.3900000000003
ourselves that do not come to potential

2467.06 --> 2479.54
because we live in a dream that makes us

2473.39 --> 2482.5699999999997
think that the way things are are

2479.54 --> 2487.64
natural and makes us adapt to that

2482.57 --> 2490.5800000000004
concept almost by placebo or actually

2487.64 --> 2492.7999999999997
really literally by placebo well this is

2490.58 --> 2496.84
of all false all these things are all

2492.8 --> 2502.34
meant to keep us afloat on top of that

2496.84 --> 2504.1400000000003
societal assumption based reality and if

2502.34 --> 2506.92
you get into the details you'll find

2504.14 --> 2511.5099999999998
that out probably that it is all

2506.92 --> 2517.2200000000003
designed based on layers of deception to

2511.51 --> 2520.19
occult to obscure from view the real

2517.22 --> 2525.1099999999997
roots of everything that only makes

2520.19 --> 2527.44
sense so yeah it's all occult in that

2525.11 --> 2527.44
sense

2529.24 --> 2541.18
right but yeah if lies are the only

2533.08 --> 2543.58
thing you've ever learned and yeah

2541.18 --> 2548.14
besides your own personal senses which

2543.58 --> 2551.0499999999997
are just what they are yeah how can you

2548.14 --> 2554.74
ever escape that well you can do it by

2551.05 --> 2559.54
your own senses because that's the only

2554.74 --> 2562.0899999999997
thing that remains true but yeah you're

2559.54 --> 2565.21
gonna have to work with what exists

2562.09 --> 2569.19
anyway you know you can even though a

2565.21 --> 2571.42
language may be routed in suggestive

2569.19 --> 2578.32
deception that doesn't mean that you

2571.42 --> 2580.08
could use that language to have the

2578.32 --> 2582.28
opposite result

2580.08 --> 2585.19
isn't that what I've been trying to do

2582.28 --> 2591.8700000000003
with it mostly through feeling as much

2585.19 --> 2596.08
as possible and showing it for me

2591.87 --> 2602.2
rough comparison English is like a

2596.08 --> 2609.79
Commodore 64 is artificial it is made as

2602.2 --> 2614.49
a blueprint a structure that well is now

2609.79 --> 2617.32
much more expensive it was like a seed

2614.49 --> 2619.87
but look what people could do with that

2617.32 --> 2622.7400000000002
freaking Commodore 64 things that were

2619.87 --> 2626.3199999999997
said would be absolutely impossible and

2622.74 --> 2628.6299999999997
that's what I feel that I'm trying to do

2626.32 --> 2634.3900000000003
with the English English language and

2628.63 --> 2637.3
the funny thing is the English language

2634.39 --> 2642.87
is relatively easy and there's so many

2637.3 --> 2642.8700000000003
people that can speak it so yeah

2645.66 --> 2655.96
any language can be mastered and be

2651.93 --> 2660.85
utilized and focused into a certain

2655.96 --> 2663.34
energy or spirit direction to enhance

2660.85 --> 2665.95
other people even though it was

2663.34 --> 2670.6600000000003
originally designed as a base foundation

2665.95 --> 2672.8199999999997
to cover up truths and to have helped

2670.66 --> 2677.5299999999997
maintain the illusion in the common

2672.82 --> 2682.57
culture but yeah if you master it then

2677.53 --> 2684.9100000000003
you can bend it to your own function and

2682.57 --> 2687.8700000000003
try to awaken people with it and that's

2684.91 --> 2687.87
what I'm trying to do

2704.11 --> 2710.6200000000003
all right well Jeffrey bill not

2708.76 --> 2713.3700000000003
understanding what the word means it's

2710.62 --> 2717.4
all up to you look I've delved into

2713.37 --> 2721.0
etymology a lot when I was young it was

2717.4 --> 2722.5
something that we did with my family

2721.0 --> 2725.17
with my mother and my brother and

2722.5 --> 2726.82
everyone we had a lot of these books so

2725.17 --> 2730.15
we would always look where do these

2726.82 --> 2734.38
words come from what do they really mean

2730.15 --> 2737.4700000000003
in the core of it to understand how

2734.38 --> 2741.94
language really works and how words work

2737.47 --> 2744.16
and it's almost like everything becomes

2741.94 --> 2747.01
phonetic it becomes like a sound

2744.16 --> 2749.74
frequency when you do that a lot and you

2747.01 --> 2753.28
start to recognize roots even though

2749.74 --> 2755.2
you've never looked it up just by how it

2753.28 --> 2761.5
appears to you by the energy of it by

2755.2 --> 2764.0699999999997
the sound what it is yeah it's very

2761.5 --> 2766.93
intuitive I guess but

2764.07 --> 2768.55
etymology yes very important to figure

2766.93 --> 2770.97
out what where words are really coming

2768.55 --> 2773.2000000000003
coming from but there are some false

2770.97 --> 2774.64
suggestions out there words that are

2773.2 --> 2778.1499999999996
very much alike that you would think

2774.64 --> 2780.22
would be connected etymology wise that

2778.15 --> 2786.64
are really not they just happen to look

2780.22 --> 2789.2099999999996
alike so you have to actually confirm

2786.64 --> 2789.21
these things

2792.69 --> 2798.63
hmm yeah etymology is fascinating

2808.099 --> 2819.589
and it is also very very interesting

2816.64 --> 2822.41
considering that for example the Roman

2819.589 --> 2827.69
Empire might never have existed that

2822.41 --> 2832.969
Latin is considered a dead language that

2827.69 --> 2836.93
was still used in so many things and

2832.969 --> 2838.93
even in science the science for a long

2836.93 --> 2841.459
long time

2838.93 --> 2844.3089999999997
churches well

2841.459 --> 2847.16
etymology wise it's basically a Greek

2844.309 --> 2850.88
extract it's an almost like an

2847.16 --> 2852.92
Anglophile of Greek in a way it was the

2850.88 --> 2855.199
same thing that happened to the what has

2852.92 --> 2860.65
become the or it didn't English language

2855.199 --> 2860.65
notes the recreation of other things and

2861.969 --> 2867.079
if that was really around if that

2864.589 --> 2871.089
language was created back then and it

2867.079 --> 2877.9990000000003
was an empire then there should be

2871.089 --> 2880.999
groups all over the place but when it

2877.999 --> 2884.569
comes down to Latin it's weird because

2880.999 --> 2889.609
it seems like Latin the Latin words

2884.569 --> 2897.65
usually are pretty much parallel to the

2889.609 --> 2899.5989999999997
French language in etymology wise that's

2897.65 --> 2903.14
what I noticed myself really

2899.599 --> 2905.9300000000003
so it seems there's not a lot of things

2903.14 --> 2911.319
really being derived from Latin

2905.93 --> 2914.4199999999996
it wasn't a open language really so

2911.319 --> 2917.359
wasn't even an actual spoken language or

2914.42 --> 2921.079
was it a secret language created by the

2917.359 --> 2926.0789999999997
Roman Catholics as a secret or called

2921.079 --> 2929.079
language for their for their plans

2926.079 --> 2929.079
see

2933.059 --> 2941.279
so yeah could the Roman language not be

2936.299 --> 2943.439
a dead language but simply not an open

2941.279 --> 2945.779
language I was never societal and there

2943.439 --> 2949.709
was always an occult language basically

2945.779 --> 2954.049
the creation to keep secrets from the

2949.709 --> 2956.8799999999997
public and historically this is

2954.049 --> 2960.689
confirmed at least about the so-called

2956.88 --> 2963.079
medieval period where the churches the

2960.689 --> 2965.009
Roman churches the old romantic

2963.079 --> 2967.319
buildings and everything that are

2965.009 --> 2969.479
supposed to have been there and the

2967.319 --> 2971.729
priests would have the books and they

2969.479 --> 2974.459
would know the language and they would

2971.729 --> 2976.589
be the only ones that knew it and you as

2974.459 --> 2980.779
in the public you were not allowed to

2976.589 --> 2985.259
know well that is very telling isn't it

2980.779 --> 2988.079
that is very very telling does that make

2985.259 --> 2990.179
sense if there was a Roman Empire that

2988.079 --> 2994.049
roamed the place that they're very

2990.179 --> 3001.309
language was not allowed to be known by

2994.049 --> 3002.809
anyone like soldier you know that did it

3001.309 --> 3005.1400000000003
feels like it doesn't make a lot of

3002.809 --> 3005.1400000000003
sense

3007.24 --> 3014.5
so again another sign that the Roman

3010.42 --> 3018.7000000000003
Empire may not have existed as is

3014.5 --> 3023.13
portrayed by historians and yeah I'm not

3018.7 --> 3029.3799999999997
excluding there was a group out there a

3023.13 --> 3033.339
culture some kind but not not just in

3029.38 --> 3037.7400000000002
the way that is portrayed it's probably

3033.339 --> 3037.74
a lot smaller was probably a group of

3044.49 --> 3053.77
old ancient occultists that had yeah

3051.339 --> 3056.0499999999997
like wizards they had all that

3053.77 --> 3058.9
technology and stuff in the fleshies and

3056.05 --> 3068.8900000000003
everything and just very intelligent

3058.9 --> 3071.109
design things and they tried stuff but I

3068.89 --> 3075.81
think they were probably around very

3071.109 --> 3078.25
short I'm not I'm not sure it still I

3075.81 --> 3080.849
still really don't know how to put it

3078.25 --> 3084.15
all into context I can pretty much

3080.849 --> 3086.98
figure out what it what it wasn't and

3084.15 --> 3089.53
what should have been around but what

3086.98 --> 3091.54
did actually happen what was there that

3089.53 --> 3094.3590000000004
could be considered the Romans for how

3091.54 --> 3097.65
long and what did they all do

3094.359 --> 3101.0499999999997
did they really rule over cities and

3097.65 --> 3104.109
make that turn them Roman or something

3101.05 --> 3108.4300000000003
was it like a cult that they forced on

3104.109 --> 3111.73
over all over the place or was it just

3108.43 --> 3117.58
one Roman city maybe it was actually

3111.73 --> 3121.9
Rome like a an outbreak of rebels for a

3117.58 --> 3123.58
period in that time maybe it was very

3121.9 --> 3127.7400000000002
shortly I don't know I have no idea I'm

3123.58 --> 3131.74
very curious to learn more about this

3127.74 --> 3134.2
were there any kind of Romans or is it

3131.74 --> 3136.5299999999997
really all a complete fabrication out of

3134.2 --> 3136.5299999999997
nothing

3140.64 --> 3143.54
yeah

3147.54 --> 3154.33
anyway I have five more minutes or

3152.56 --> 3160.99
something so I'm gonna round out the

3154.33 --> 3163.9
show let's yeah Jeffrey bill is very

3160.99 --> 3167.64
active in chat appreciated by the way

3163.9 --> 3167.64
it's interesting things to say

3181.73 --> 3184.809
that's interesting

3189.46 --> 3196.19
that is fascinating

3192.22 --> 3201.41
I've always wondered about that the the

3196.19 --> 3204.44
Roma culture why are they called why

3201.41 --> 3206.5989999999997
that and the Romans it is so bizarre it

3204.44 --> 3209.7200000000003
almost it made me think at a time that

3206.599 --> 3214.13
the Romans were basically the Roma and

3209.72 --> 3216.2599999999998
maybe they did have like a let's just go

3214.13 --> 3221.15
off all fantasy they have like a wizard

3216.26 --> 3224.3
king or something they're not shy of

3221.15 --> 3226.099
dealing with the occult that that

3224.3 --> 3231.349
actually did this and it was actually

3226.099 --> 3233.96
like a robot take over or something I

3231.349 --> 3238.3
don't know it sounds really weird you

3233.96 --> 3238.3
know maybe if played too much deity but

3239.619 --> 3245.9900000000002
it is always very weird to me that the

3242.99 --> 3253.31
Romans and the Roman Empire and now you

3245.99 --> 3255.77
have the aroma doesn't look anything

3253.31 --> 3258.859
like the Romans were suggested to look

3255.77 --> 3261.5
like of course very different type of

3258.859 --> 3264.369
culture but just always like what's with

3261.5 --> 3271.03
that name why are they so much the same

3264.369 --> 3277.04
so weird anyway

3271.03 --> 3281.48
yeah the Romans what what was really

3277.04 --> 3284.77
there is another myth or was it or did

3281.48 --> 3290.0
something happen and was it just

3284.77 --> 3292.28
mythologies and then we mythologies

3290.0 --> 3297.49
again and made part of a false history

3292.28 --> 3302.27
to cover up a couple of events that

3297.49 --> 3308.8689999999997
people didn't want questions in future

3302.27 --> 3313.369
generations how the powers that be are

3308.869 --> 3319.25
never shy to change history how evil

3313.369 --> 3322.25
that may seem to the common people or

3319.25 --> 3325.06
the moral common people

3322.25 --> 3333.52
yeah rulers do it all the time

3325.06 --> 3333.52
unfortunately throughout history so

3338.38 --> 3348.46
right I'm gonna round out the show so

3344.57 --> 3350.78
thank you all for coming it's been

3348.46 --> 3354.14
interesting hang out a lot of good

3350.78 --> 3356.42
subjects yeah if you like the video

3354.14 --> 3361.1
please about it and subscribe to my

3356.42 --> 3363.05
channel if you haven't already I will be

3361.1 --> 3366.41
back tomorrow on flat earth

3363.05 --> 3369.7400000000002
early bird number 46 and I will be on

3366.41 --> 3377.44
the flat earth debates right after this

3369.74 --> 3377.4399999999996
so yeah until the next show keep it flat
