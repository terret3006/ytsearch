friday but

84.0 --> 87.84
yeah this time it's just

88.88 --> 93.03999999999999
i don't know how that happened i thought

91.119 --> 93.68
i went for groceries pretty early but

93.04 --> 95.759
then

93.68 --> 97.759
when i got back it was late after all

95.759 --> 100.88
it's

97.759 --> 104.399
but anyway yeah the weather is

100.88 --> 107.92
strange very surprising just look

104.399 --> 112.88
sun just got

107.92 --> 112.88
out from between the clouds over there

113.52 --> 124.88
but yeah look look over there see that

118.719 --> 128.0
poof it's probably raining over there

124.88 --> 130.879
it's the dark dark grey clouds

128.0 --> 133.84
but right over here not so much right

130.879 --> 133.84
now so it seems

134.16 --> 138.48
like i'm gonna get a light spot

139.2 --> 145.76
yeah big clouds over there

142.56 --> 145.76
managed to keep it dry

146.28 --> 151.92
[Music]

148.959 --> 154.64000000000001
even though yeah the entire night it was

151.92 --> 156.95899999999997
mostly just raining and

154.64 --> 157.67999999999998
wind was blowing very hard it's kind of

156.959 --> 161.36
a hassle

157.68 --> 164.239
but yeah despite that it's not that cold

161.36 --> 167.28
in the wind it is kind of cold but in

164.239 --> 169.92000000000002
here not so much i do have my heater on

167.28 --> 170.48
and i thought i'm gonna go in my shirt

169.92 --> 173.599
today

170.48 --> 176.23899999999998
so all right

173.599 --> 177.67999999999998
anyway let's see who's in chat good

176.239 --> 180.8
servant was first

177.68 --> 180.8
patiently waiting

180.959 --> 190.0
uh amanda jung obermoko outer pond

185.28 --> 190.0
ponds philosophy hello

190.8 --> 194.4
yeah good to see you so far

195.44 --> 199.12
and again sorry for it being late i'm

198.159 --> 202.48
trying to

199.12 --> 202.48000000000002
not make a habit out of it

204.959 --> 207.92000000000002
hey adam meekin

208.08 --> 213.28
yeah i did catch some of iron realm this

210.239 --> 216.879
morning but not a lot

213.28 --> 219.92
i got in like after an hour and then

216.879 --> 219.92
i was too busy

221.35 --> 227.84
[Music]

223.76 --> 227.84
let's start making notes for today

235.92 --> 242.39999999999998
right so yesterday flat earth debates

239.599 --> 242.39999999999998
was really good

242.64 --> 250.48
again i think it was

246.319 --> 253.83999999999997
ed again that seems to be

250.48 --> 256.0
trying to become the new fallacy pioneer

253.84 --> 258.32
he's really doing his best

256.0 --> 259.6
and it's becoming a thing i i think i

258.32 --> 261.919
called it

259.6 --> 265.91900000000004
you know it sounds like a joke fallacy

261.919 --> 268.639
pioneer but it really describes

265.919 --> 269.59999999999997
well what the ballers do what the trench

268.639 --> 271.68
ballers these

269.6 --> 273.28000000000003
idiot ballers that come on the flat

271.68 --> 276.24
earth debate that try that out

273.28 --> 278.0
and that are connected with the others

276.24 --> 280.96000000000004
it's what they do

278.0 --> 282.0
so i called it and let's see how long

280.96 --> 283.84
it's gonna take before

282.0 --> 285.84
people are just gonna call them fallacy

283.84 --> 288.88
pioneers because they figured out that

285.84 --> 290.63899999999995
that's exactly what they are almost what

288.88 --> 293.44
they're trying to be without even

290.639 --> 293.44
realizing it

294.84 --> 301.03999999999996
ah

297.36 --> 301.04
hey golden wellies

303.039 --> 307.28
no i'm not gonna change my schedule

309.039 --> 312.56
no there's nothing wrong with the

310.32 --> 316.479
schedule it's just wrong with

312.56 --> 318.479
my day and nighttime rhythm

316.479 --> 324.15999999999997
because yeah i explained it many times

318.479 --> 327.199
before i need some time to start up

324.16 --> 329.6
like to wake up and if that's if i

327.199 --> 331.6
wake up too late then it just takes more

329.6 --> 332.8
time and if i then have to do all kinds

331.6 --> 335.03900000000004
of things

332.8 --> 336.08
the unfortunate side effects that they i

335.039 --> 338.88
guess

336.08 --> 340.4
tend to take longer without me

338.88 --> 343.44
consciously realizing it

340.4 --> 346.56
like my my time

343.44 --> 347.68
tracking system my inner system takes

346.56 --> 352.16
some time to

347.68 --> 354.639
get properly aligned as it were

352.16 --> 356.56
yeah the only way to bypass that is just

354.639 --> 359.759
by getting up earlier

356.56 --> 360.88
but yeah i still i tend to stay up late

359.759 --> 366.16
these days

360.88 --> 370.08
i don't know just in that mood again

366.16 --> 374.72
trying not to slip d too deep into it

370.08 --> 374.71999999999997
anyway the earth passenger

375.44 --> 395.84
kiwi was extremely disrespectful to me

378.96 --> 395.84
really how so

400.16 --> 404.47900000000004
yeah i don't know maybe he was a bit

402.16 --> 408.88000000000005
grouchy but yeah

404.479 --> 411.919
why take that personal i think he

408.88 --> 414.71999999999997
like had he was on the show

411.919 --> 416.79999999999995
and then after it ended he only then did

414.72 --> 419.84000000000003
he get breakfast so he kind of

416.8 --> 423.039
yeah got on the show without breakfast

419.84 --> 427.28
but he was a bit interruptive

423.039 --> 430.96
it's it's like when nathan

427.28 --> 434.0
really bites onto a baller

430.96 --> 437.599
as he does then it's just best to

434.0 --> 441.52
not interrupt to really let him

437.599 --> 444.0
do his thing because if you just

441.52 --> 446.639
want to i want to buy two or i want to

444.0 --> 449.199
buy two it's

446.639 --> 450.72
that's very interruptive it's actually

449.199 --> 453.44
annoying

450.72 --> 455.44000000000005
and when i do it yeah nathan calls me

453.44 --> 459.039
out on it because when i do it it's very

455.44 --> 461.039
hard for me to stop and i kind of need

459.039 --> 464.8
need a clear sign but others are doing

461.039 --> 467.84
it like flat side tends to do it a lot

464.8 --> 469.36
and it's really annoying and kiwi when

467.84 --> 471.28
he gets on especially

469.36 --> 473.599
when he hasn't has bra had breakfast he

471.28 --> 476.15999999999997
does it all the time

473.599 --> 478.87899999999996
and it's yeah it's almost impossible to

476.16 --> 479.759
call him on it like nathan doesn't

478.879 --> 482.47900000000004
really call

479.759 --> 484.879
him on it just ask him can you please

482.479 --> 488.31899999999996
just let it finish

484.879 --> 491.03900000000004
he doesn't yeah

488.319 --> 491.03900000000004
how do you call that

491.44 --> 495.68
he doesn't really punishingly address

494.639 --> 497.919
him but

495.68 --> 499.199
yeah it is it just works the way it does

497.919 --> 502.24
and

499.199 --> 505.28000000000003
my priority when i'm on that show is to

502.24 --> 506.319
enhance the show so usually what i do is

505.28 --> 510.0
end up either

506.319 --> 511.36
making my own lunch or i go on groceries

510.0 --> 513.44
well i won't have to do that today

511.36 --> 516.64
because i already went for it

513.44 --> 517.12
or i just stick to the chat because when

516.64 --> 520.08
nathan

517.12 --> 521.36
grills a baller the chat gets very

520.08 --> 524.48
active

521.36 --> 526.5600000000001
both baller trolls and the flat earthers

524.48 --> 529.519
get very enthusiastic

526.56 --> 531.68
and there's yeah the chat gets a lot of

529.519 --> 533.92
messages that need approval

531.68 --> 536.7199999999999
so i spend a lot of time on that and

533.92 --> 539.8389999999999
that way i think the show

536.72 --> 549.839
turns out pretty great so

539.839 --> 549.839
that's just how it works

551.76 --> 554.08
what

558.48 --> 563.839
do you

569.279 --> 575.68
i i have no idea what you're talking

572.24 --> 579.2
about hasten slowly that's

575.68 --> 581.519
i i didn't hear at doing that although i

579.2 --> 584.72
wouldn't be surprised if he did but

581.519 --> 588.0
if he did i didn't hear it

584.72 --> 588.0
maybe in the uh

588.399 --> 592.08
in the discord panel they they could

590.32 --> 593.6800000000001
have heard that

592.08 --> 595.6
but i didn't because when nathan

593.68 --> 599.279
basically grinds down

595.6 --> 602.32
on people like ed then

599.279 --> 605.8389999999999
his speaking tends to gate for the

602.32 --> 605.839
google panel

607.76 --> 611.12
what are you talking about

612.8 --> 618.24
you must be the only person oh really

616.24 --> 619.92
you think you can gaslight me like that

618.24 --> 621.76
like i'm the only person in the world

619.92 --> 633.8389999999999
believing in flat earth

621.76 --> 633.8389999999999
no no you're just gaslighting yourself

637.04 --> 640.399
what what do you mean then

645.519 --> 650.32
look if you're gonna address somebody

647.2 --> 653.519
else in chat it would be wise

650.32 --> 656.24
to put their name next to it

653.519 --> 657.279
because i interact with my chat a lot so

656.24 --> 660.88
if you're gonna say

657.279 --> 662.88
something that could be interpreted in

660.88 --> 665.36
ways you don't want it to it would be

662.88 --> 668.72
best to address it specifically

665.36 --> 668.72
if it's not addressed to me

669.44 --> 675.839
if you want to avoid calamity

684.079 --> 689.5999999999999
anyway a random

695.839 --> 705.2
so uh yeah yeah let's see the notes

702.0 --> 705.2
oh god i forgot

705.279 --> 709.36
i'm watching this new series but it's

707.36 --> 711.36
really i'm watching it as a study

709.36 --> 714.24
because it's not directed for people

711.36 --> 714.24
like me but i'm

714.8 --> 719.1999999999999
it's basically it sounds it sounds

717.279 --> 722.48
really awkward when i say it

719.2 --> 723.6800000000001
but i'm doing it as a cultural study in

722.48 --> 727.04
this case

723.68 --> 729.04
and also because well i'll explain

727.04 --> 731.36
i'm watching this new series but i think

729.04 --> 735.279
it's meant for kids

731.36 --> 738.48
sort of or for very young teenagers

735.279 --> 740.56
and it's it's like a harry potter

738.48 --> 744.9590000000001
universe

740.56 --> 748.16
but a little softer

744.959 --> 751.279
it's it's really kitty [ __ ] and

748.16 --> 754.399
like really kitty [ __ ] but it's it's

751.279 --> 758.16
interesting to me because of

754.399 --> 761.44
just yeah i'm trying to figure out

758.16 --> 762.399
what it is basically because back in the

761.44 --> 764.8000000000001
day

762.399 --> 765.44
i would not watch this [ __ ] no matter

764.8 --> 768.16
what

765.44 --> 769.2
because i hate it because it's so stupid

768.16 --> 772.399
and now i'm just like

769.2 --> 775.12
okay this apparently

772.399 --> 777.2
might work for certain kids i want to

775.12 --> 780.24
understand why and i want to see what

777.2 --> 782.8000000000001
these kids are doing also because

780.24 --> 784.9590000000001
well in this series they really do seem

782.8 --> 788.959
like kids

784.959 --> 792.3199999999999
they don't seem so much like children

788.959 --> 795.4399999999999
acting like adults as much and

792.32 --> 797.7600000000001
i kind of like that's better because

795.44 --> 799.519
yeah they're actually more like what

797.76 --> 801.6
they're supposed to be

799.519 --> 803.76
how they're supposed it's more natural

801.6 --> 805.76
and i yeah but it's about it's like a

803.76 --> 807.68
harry potter sort of school situation

805.76 --> 811.68
what's it called again

807.68 --> 811.68
ugh like

812.959 --> 816.3199999999999
it's a netflix thing

816.399 --> 820.079
and yeah there is dubious things in it

819.36 --> 822.88
too

820.079 --> 824.399
oh yeah the worst witch it's called i

822.88 --> 825.6
don't know man there's a lot of these

824.399 --> 829.04
witches

825.6 --> 831.279
series and things going on on netflix

829.04 --> 832.24
but this just caught my attention and

831.279 --> 834.32
i'm yeah

832.24 --> 836.0
looking at it as a studying object and

834.32 --> 838.399
also trying to compare it to harry

836.0 --> 840.639
potter and i'm really wondering like

838.399 --> 842.0
is it the harry potter universe because

840.639 --> 844.16
it doesn't seem to be

842.0 --> 846.0
exactly like that they have different

844.16 --> 849.12
spell mechanics and all that

846.0 --> 853.12
but it's very harry potter-ish

849.12 --> 856.72
in the way it works but it's also

853.12 --> 858.9590000000001
more classical

856.72 --> 858.9590000000001
uh

861.68 --> 868.399
like pagan

865.12 --> 871.76
style witch craft

868.399 --> 873.68
in a more real more moderate

871.76 --> 876.16
modest sense but at the same time

873.68 --> 878.399
there's also like harry potter spells

876.16 --> 879.04
like flying and broomsticks and stuff

878.399 --> 882.079
and

879.04 --> 884.7199999999999
i don't know it's a bit of a mix but i'm

882.079 --> 887.199
kind of curious

884.72 --> 887.1990000000001
anyway

888.639 --> 892.0
i'm also studying it to wonder like

890.639 --> 894.0790000000001
would i let my kids

892.0 --> 895.68
watch this and how would i let them

894.079 --> 899.8389999999999
watch this

895.68 --> 899.8389999999999
if i did

905.839 --> 910.639
i think it's directed at like between

910.72 --> 915.519
8 and 12 year old or something as age

913.92 --> 918.399
category and oh yeah

915.519 --> 919.6
one another thing it's all women it's

918.399 --> 921.839
like

919.6 --> 923.519
there's no guys in this in this entire

921.839 --> 925.839
so it's like a women's

923.519 --> 927.519
or girl squid reminds me like of a

925.839 --> 929.759
catholic school but then it's like a

927.519 --> 932.72
witch's school and it's harry potter

929.759 --> 932.72
it i don't know yes

933.12 --> 937.199
i don't know it's a curiosity and i'm

935.12 --> 939.12
kind of checking it out it's not like oh

937.199 --> 941.8389999999999
yeah this is awesome no

939.12 --> 941.839
i'm just curious

947.04 --> 951.04
and i'm just glad that they're not doing

949.279 --> 954.16
like creepy

951.04 --> 955.4399999999999
or like creepy borderline pedo [ __ ] or

954.16 --> 958.639
anything in this

955.44 --> 958.639
not so far anyway

959.04 --> 983.8389999999999
so i'm just very relieved of that

969.6 --> 983.839
what are you talking about

986.079 --> 990.959
okay hasten slowly goodbye then

991.199 --> 998.88
ah yeah hasten slowly he's got pro

997.279 --> 1002.48
not surprising if you got a

998.88 --> 1002.48
contradicting name like that

1009.04 --> 1013.04
yeah and i don't ban people

1013.36 --> 1018.399
because of their model hasten slowly

1016.16 --> 1022.3199999999999
there's plenty of people in here

1018.399 --> 1022.32
that are still holding onto the globe

1022.48 --> 1028.16
or another aspect of creation that they

1026.48 --> 1031.039
don't like

1028.16 --> 1033.1200000000001
so i don't ban them for them i ban them

1031.039 --> 1036.24
for their behavior and especially

1033.12 --> 1036.2399999999998
zealous behavior

1037.6 --> 1040.7199999999998
like if you're being addressed on a

1039.76 --> 1044.079
fallacy

1040.72 --> 1047.199
and you don't correct yourself

1044.079 --> 1048.24
you can always take a step back just

1047.199 --> 1050.24
calm it down

1048.24 --> 1051.76
nothing will happen i don't ban people

1050.24 --> 1053.2
that do that and they know it

1051.76 --> 1054.8799999999999
that's why they're still in chat that's

1053.2 --> 1056.559
why some have wrenches because they

1054.88 --> 1057.8400000000001
earned it because they know how to

1056.559 --> 1060.32
conduct themselves

1057.84 --> 1061.6
but if you do double down and you're

1060.32 --> 1063.2
like no

1061.6 --> 1065.6789999999999
or you're gonna spam or you're gonna get

1063.2 --> 1067.8400000000001
ugly or disgusting

1065.679 --> 1069.44
and yeah a lot of ballers out there do

1067.84 --> 1071.12
yeah then you're going to get banned

1069.44 --> 1072.88
and then your sock accounts are going to

1071.12 --> 1073.84
get banned when you start to spam with

1072.88 --> 1075.5200000000002
that

1073.84 --> 1077.039
yeah that's what happens it has nothing

1075.52 --> 1079.44
to do with their model it has to do with

1077.039 --> 1082.96
their behavior

1079.44 --> 1085.3600000000001
it's been very clear about this

1082.96 --> 1095.8400000000001
it's also part of the rules in the chat

1085.36 --> 1095.84
that you can read in the description box

1099.12 --> 1109.84
george sanford what

1110.4 --> 1116.16
yeah it's funny isn't it guns of nephron

1114.16 --> 1117.679
it when you think about it the word

1116.16 --> 1122.72
atmosphere is of course

1117.679 --> 1124.96
reifying the ball into gas

1122.72 --> 1126.88
but if you call it air you could call

1124.96 --> 1129.919
the atmosphere

1126.88 --> 1129.919
the airplane

1131.039 --> 1136.48
and that would be basically restoring

1135.039 --> 1138.64
the nature of the

1136.48 --> 1141.72
word that we've been using atmosphere

1138.64 --> 1144.72
into the proper

1141.72 --> 1146.24
non-circumdecular geometry based version

1144.72 --> 1148.96
of it

1146.24 --> 1150.559
and then it would be called airplane or

1148.96 --> 1154.72
atmosplane but

1150.559 --> 1154.72
that's i don't know it just sounds weird

1160.799 --> 1166.32
oh oh okay nice and slowly

1170.4 --> 1183.2
yeah that's terrible

1179.52 --> 1186.48
all right that's okay

1183.2 --> 1189.679
i'd i'd be mess i'd be raging

1186.48 --> 1189.679
if i saw something like

1191.44 --> 1193.8400000000001
it's that

1199.22 --> 1202.339
[Music]

1207.6 --> 1211.36
yeah take care man just i don't know

1210.48 --> 1214.96
just

1211.36 --> 1219.1999999999998
take it easy keep it calm

1214.96 --> 1219.2
don't don't dwell on dark [ __ ]

1219.28 --> 1223.44
what i uh what worked best for me

1221.679 --> 1226.96
against that type of situation

1223.44 --> 1234.0800000000002
is to just i don't know try to

1226.96 --> 1236.799
yeah just try to enjoy like a garden

1234.08 --> 1240.08
maybe a forest or something and just

1236.799 --> 1240.08
enjoy simple things

1240.64 --> 1246.24
then that way you also don't get

1243.679 --> 1248.159
the tendency to dwell upon dark things

1246.24 --> 1249.52
or start seeing that [ __ ] as an echo in

1248.159 --> 1254.0800000000002
your mind and that [ __ ]

1249.52 --> 1263.84
so take care man anyway

1254.08 --> 1263.84
hey traffic in my restaurant

1281.44 --> 1286.48
still having internet shopping battles

1284.159 --> 1286.48
what

1288.84 --> 1291.84
dude

1308.32 --> 1319.84
all right

1325.52 --> 1333.84
uh right oh yeah getting distracted here

1335.12 --> 1337.9189999999999
frustrated

1338.24 --> 1350.799
yeah everything is still going

1346.08 --> 1354.96
the well the locked internet shopping

1350.799 --> 1358.8799999999999
the lockdown and all the yeah the

1354.96 --> 1362.159
unraveling that it causes in the

1358.88 --> 1365.44
yeah in the trade network worldwide

1362.159 --> 1367.7600000000002
it is still going and

1365.44 --> 1369.44
yeah there is some movement against it

1367.76 --> 1372.96
at least but

1369.44 --> 1374.799
yeah we're still seeing the damage of it

1372.96 --> 1378.0
all

1374.799 --> 1378.0
or a lot of us are

1378.48 --> 1389.84
i don't know when it's gonna end as well

1400.84 --> 1403.84
good

1404.24 --> 1409.36
oh yeah did anyone see uh uh owen

1407.12 --> 1413.6789999999999
benjamin was live yesterday as well

1409.36 --> 1416.7199999999998
did anyone catch the mountain bear

1413.679 --> 1419.44
clip that was pretty cool

1416.72 --> 1420.72
it's like king big bear with this

1419.44 --> 1424.0
braided crown

1420.72 --> 1425.039
and helmet drawn it was like drawn on

1424.0 --> 1430.64
there

1425.039 --> 1434.08
at the dmv that was really interesting

1430.64 --> 1445.8400000000001
ira was in there too all right

1434.08 --> 1445.84
yeah it was funny anyway good clip

1446.32 --> 1451.52
over a grand in a week sheesh guns have

1448.799 --> 1455.279
never roamed what

1451.52 --> 1455.279
what what are you spending all that on

1456.84 --> 1459.84
poof

1467.51 --> 1470.64
[Music]

1478.48 --> 1488.88
a bed okay those can be expensive indeed

1484.32 --> 1488.8799999999999
i should know i have one in my storage

1491.52 --> 1501.84
a cast iron framed bed

1494.96 --> 1501.8400000000001
pretty awesome thing kind of gothic

1512.84 --> 1515.84
electronics

1516.88 --> 1519.7600000000002
laptop and

1520.32 --> 1527.2
okay okay i get it

1524.88 --> 1528.0
yeah well no problem dude if i'd have

1527.2 --> 1530.4
have a

1528.0 --> 1531.679
thousand euros i would spend that all in

1530.4 --> 1533.6000000000001
a week

1531.679 --> 1535.8400000000001
very quickly on things that i really

1533.6 --> 1535.84
need

1537.36 --> 1543.84
because yeah that's easy i could

1539.36 --> 1543.84
probably spend more than that

1547.919 --> 1557.8400000000001
just unlike just large

1551.6 --> 1557.84
numerous amounts of things

1562.72 --> 1571.84
right anyway

1585.76 --> 1588.1589999999999
right

1593.2 --> 1596.0
compulsive

1597.679 --> 1599.8400000000001
wow

1603.2 --> 1606.24
that must be tough

1607.039 --> 1612.08
to yeah to a lot yeah that you have that

1610.159 --> 1614.3200000000002
luxury that you allow yourself to do

1612.08 --> 1614.32
that

1615.6 --> 1621.279
like if i do that kind of [ __ ] i'm

1617.52 --> 1621.279
punishing myself for a week

1621.84 --> 1626.32
or sometimes it's just even like okay

1624.32 --> 1628.24
i'm buying something that i actually

1626.32 --> 1629.52
need that's really good for my health

1628.24 --> 1631.919
for example

1629.52 --> 1633.12
but i could live without it but i really

1631.919 --> 1635.279
feel like i need it

1633.12 --> 1636.9599999999998
and then i spend money on it and then

1635.279 --> 1639.36
suddenly i'm short that kind of [ __ ]

1636.96 --> 1655.8400000000001
well i'm punishing myself for that

1639.36 --> 1655.84
so you know

1666.84 --> 1669.84
okay

1680.84 --> 1683.84
ah

1693.279 --> 1699.039
right yeah a random explorer

1697.36 --> 1701.12
that there's more compulsive shopping

1699.039 --> 1704.24
there's more compulsive internet

1701.12 --> 1708.2399999999998
shopping and of course there

1704.24 --> 1710.88
is yeah supposed free

1708.24 --> 1713.039
online games as well for you to spend

1710.88 --> 1713.6000000000001
time on but they're never really free

1713.039 --> 1717.679
and they're

1713.6 --> 1720.799
very refined at tricking you to

1717.679 --> 1725.3600000000001
just give a little they're

1720.799 --> 1728.8799999999999
like ultimate grabbler games so

1725.36 --> 1730.1589999999999
and i have i in the day and i'm talking

1728.88 --> 1733.8400000000001
about 12 years ago

1730.159 --> 1737.3600000000001
i i wasted a freaking thousand

1733.84 --> 1738.1589999999999
euros on one of those games and it was a

1737.36 --> 1740.32
kind of stupid

1738.159 --> 1742.0800000000002
game too like it wasn't even a good

1740.32 --> 1744.48
looking game

1742.08 --> 1748.0
that was way in the beginning when i

1744.48 --> 1751.039
first really got prolonged internet

1748.0 --> 1754.32
and i had yeah the i had a huge

1751.039 --> 1757.84
huge pile of money from

1754.32 --> 1759.12
yeah from the inheritance from my mother

1757.84 --> 1762.48
and all that

1759.12 --> 1764.7199999999998
that huge so but still that was insane

1762.48 --> 1767.76
and realizing afterward how much i spent

1764.72 --> 1770.64
on that and just never doing that again

1767.76 --> 1772.559
but as i said before i do play some

1770.64 --> 1774.0
supposed free online games if they're

1772.559 --> 1776.96
just good enough

1774.0 --> 1777.6
and then i might spend some on it but

1776.96 --> 1780.96
i'm just

1777.6 --> 1783.4399999999998
very careful

1780.96 --> 1785.52
like i always compare it to video games

1783.44 --> 1787.44
that i bought

1785.52 --> 1789.2
they can be pretty expensive so i

1787.44 --> 1792.8400000000001
basically say okay

1789.2 --> 1795.679
don't ever spend on any free game more

1792.84 --> 1801.1999999999998
then its equal

1795.679 --> 1804.3200000000002
value as if it were a game you would buy

1801.2 --> 1804.32
and that kind of works

1804.399 --> 1809.279
and don't get hasty you know don't want

1806.88 --> 1810.88
to quickly go get ahead

1809.279 --> 1812.48
because then so much more now that's

1810.88 --> 1814.3200000000002
actually a kind of

1812.48 --> 1817.3600000000001
ruining of the experience in my

1814.32 --> 1817.36
experience but anyway

1822.08 --> 1825.12
don't spend too much

1827.679 --> 1830.799
or right yeah when you spend on

1829.2 --> 1833.279
something like that don't see it as like

1830.799 --> 1835.76
oh i'm getting what i want now see it as

1833.279 --> 1839.12
okay i'm now allowing myself to

1835.76 --> 1842.399
basically squirt for a second

1839.12 --> 1843.6789999999999
to support the game the makers of the

1842.399 --> 1845.9189999999999
game

1843.679 --> 1847.52
if you see it like that in and you hold

1845.919 --> 1849.44
on that it has to be

1847.52 --> 1850.72
like that in order for you to ever do

1849.44 --> 1853.919
something like that

1850.72 --> 1855.919
then it's much more attainable i get

1853.919 --> 1859.8400000000001
better control over dealing with those

1855.919 --> 1859.8400000000001
situations when i look at it like that

1862.96 --> 1867.8400000000001
what was the game uh lost chaos

1866.159 --> 1871.2
was called i think it's probably still

1867.84 --> 1874.24
up it's totally like a really

1871.2 --> 1878.24
stupid third-person

1874.24 --> 1879.279
top-down online game it was like world

1878.24 --> 1882.559
of warcraft

1879.279 --> 1882.559
super super light

1883.679 --> 1896.3990000000001
and ugly

1893.679 --> 1897.44
yeah what a waste that was on the other

1896.399 --> 1900.8799999999999
hand i did

1897.44 --> 1903.679
talk with a lot of girls

1900.88 --> 1903.679
through that game

1905.12 --> 1912.399
such a nerd although one eye i

1909.039 --> 1912.399
actually i still know her

1912.64 --> 1915.6000000000001
it's a girl from

1916.559 --> 1923.12
from from moldavia

1921.279 --> 1925.12
i would have never gotten to know a girl

1923.12 --> 1935.84
like that if i hadn't been playing

1925.12 --> 1935.84
an online game

1958.0 --> 1963.84
oh yeah be careful with that guns of

1960.84 --> 1963.84
nephron

1967.84 --> 1974.84
what's up with naked girl gamers what

1972.72 --> 1977.84
what are you talking about i have no

1974.84 --> 1977.84
idea

1980.64 --> 1988.159
you mean like games

1984.08 --> 1988.96
where the game models are very scantily

1988.159 --> 1991.279
closed or

1988.96 --> 1992.64
is there a naked thing now or is this

1991.279 --> 1995.76
like an adult

1992.64 --> 1996.96
i don't know man i don't care i'm not

1995.76 --> 1999.44
into squirting

1996.96 --> 1999.44
like that

2001.76 --> 2007.44
and yeah i've over the years

2005.12 --> 2009.039
not so much anymore now thanks to big

2007.44 --> 2012.72
bear but over the years i've watched

2009.039 --> 2014.32
plenty of porn and like the free online

2012.72 --> 2016.96
stuff supposedly

2014.32 --> 2018.6399999999999
not i'm not gonna get into it but yeah

2016.96 --> 2022.0
there would be like

2018.64 --> 2022.72
freaky freaky advertisement with like oh

not doing it

but yeah you brought it up so i yeah

2274.96 --> 2280.56
when you bring something up

it is

2281.52 --> 2285.44
you know especially if you're going to

2282.96 --> 2290.16
bring it up in my chat

knowing who i am right so

2290.16 --> 2293.2

2291.92 --> 2299.839
describe

2293.2 --> 2299.839

how can you call it truth if you don't

2332.96 --> 2341.839
even know what it is

2350.0 --> 2355.92
could it be that it's just the name

2353.119 --> 2357.2000000000003
of a youtube channel or something that

2355.92 --> 2360.0
could also be an option

2357.2 --> 2362.24
do you know is it something you heard

2360.0 --> 2365.68
and then you just brought it up

2362.24 --> 2369.68

2708.56 --> 2712.7999999999997
it's a youtube video

2713.92 --> 2720.16
[ __ ] sake man sorry i'm getting

2717.599 --> 2724.0

i've been wasting 10 minutes on this

yeah why didn't you just say it then

2726.72 --> 2731.2
it's a

2727.76 --> 2734.5600000000004
youtube video or it's a

2731.2 --> 2738.24
youtube channel done 10 minutes not

2742.0 --> 2752.24
it's female gamer

so it is a phenomenon then

2752.24 --> 2763.1189999999997
why is this taking 10 minutes

2760.079 --> 2766.2400000000002
why is it still confusing as to what

2763.119 --> 2766.2400000000002
this thing really is

2768.16 --> 2773.5989999999997

exactly

2773.599 --> 2781.119
right so it is literal then

2777.92 --> 2784.4

for [ __ ] sake literal naked

2784.4 --> 2790.64
girls playing games on camera

2787.599 --> 2794.319
you could have just said that

2790.64 --> 2797.359
that is exactly what it is not

2794.319 --> 2797.359
leave me guessing

2800.839 --> 2807.52

2828.8 --> 2833.28
going around

2830.8 --> 2834.2400000000002
what culture is basically being polluted

2833.28 --> 2836.6400000000003

my concern this is like future concern
