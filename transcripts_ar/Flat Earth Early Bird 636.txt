359.67 --> 363.759
[Music]

361.28 --> 363.75899999999996
i don't know

uh

380.7 --> 386.24
[Music]

382.479 --> 386.24

411.919 --> 416.4
i don't remember this is weird i don't

420.84 --> 423.84
remember

426.319 --> 430.96000000000004
oh wait i did hang around in the after

428.639 --> 430.96000000000004
show

432.4 --> 436.479
so yeah it must have been life it's

434.4 --> 438.03
weird man i mix it up

436.479 --> 440.15999999999997
i mix it up

438.03 --> 443.35999999999996
[Music]

440.16 --> 446.47900000000004
also because there's always like uh

443.36 --> 447.28000000000003
premieres after that later in the

446.479 --> 450.4
evening so

447.28 --> 452.23999999999995
sometimes i just mix it up in my mind

450.4 --> 453.52
that's why i should make notes this is

452.24 --> 455.599
because otherwise it's going to be a

453.52 --> 458.56
mess

455.599 --> 459.759
i didn't watch any movies or anything

458.56 --> 463.28000000000003
and i went to bed like

459.759 --> 465.599
really early 11 o'clock

463.28 --> 467.11999999999995
that's some catching up to do because

465.599 --> 469.28
yesterday

467.12 --> 471.12
or yeah the day before the night before

469.28 --> 472.23999999999995
was extremely late so i went to bed

471.12 --> 474.16
really early

472.24 --> 476.639
was kind of necessary there's some weird

474.16 --> 479.759
little things going on

476.639 --> 482.96000000000004
for example apparently yeah my

479.759 --> 485.44
roommate the girl had been

482.96 --> 487.44
tested on corona because she had

485.44 --> 488.71999999999997
symptoms and their work made her do it

487.44 --> 490.479
and guess what

488.72 --> 493.68
yeah a positive because of those

490.479 --> 497.039
freaking tests always give positives

493.68 --> 499.52
and yeah that's

497.039 --> 501.12
through tracer nonsense i'm going to be

499.52 --> 503.039
marked up like this now

501.12 --> 504.72
by that if that if that's even going to

503.039 --> 507.84
count for anything

504.72 --> 507.84000000000003
so that's weird

508.08 --> 515.1999999999999
uh as an extra precaution

511.84 --> 516.959
i bought some zinc you know

515.2 --> 520.24
i had been thinking of that for a long

516.959 --> 535.8389999999999
time but

520.24 --> 535.839
dude what is it

536.8 --> 543.3599999999999
good servant could you please just form

540.16 --> 547.1999999999999
entire sentences and not type out

543.36 --> 550.32
three separate words like in

547.2 --> 553.36
in 10 separate sentences that's

550.32 --> 553.36
that's really annoying

557.519 --> 561.519
but i don't know i don't i've heard

559.44 --> 563.839
about richie from boston

561.519 --> 567.6
i didn't know he called him out whatever

563.839 --> 567.6
that means i don't know what's going on

570.08 --> 574.08
my flat tapped engines

574.839 --> 580.1600000000001
what

576.959 --> 584.2399999999999
yeah good servant the it's the same

580.16 --> 591.8389999999999
just don't

584.24 --> 591.839
don't filler my chat please

602.839 --> 605.839
what

605.92 --> 609.279
rolls royce okay

613.519 --> 616.079
all right

617.2 --> 619.839
uh

639.839 --> 647.12
right yeah weirdly enough i got a bit

643.839 --> 649.2790000000001
lower backache weird

647.12 --> 651.2
like yesterday i had a bit trouble like

649.279 --> 653.279
in my higher back and now it's my lower

651.2 --> 657.0400000000001
back it's kind of like

653.279 --> 659.68
frozen up in a certain position so it's

657.04 --> 661.519
probably that certain muscles

659.68 --> 663.8389999999999
are having bleeding issues slight

661.519 --> 667.12
inflammation local very typical

663.839 --> 667.7600000000001
in extreme weather changes and now it's

667.12 --> 669.92
probably

667.76 --> 672.56
trying to change back again because it's

669.92 --> 672.56
getting warm

672.839 --> 679.2
uh i've taken some

676.079 --> 682.3199999999999
sapa meadow

679.2 --> 686.24
because i think that does help

682.32 --> 689.839
against yeah local inflammations

686.24 --> 689.839
it's helped a lot so far

689.92 --> 696.24
ah but it's still kind of like you need

693.2 --> 696.24
alkaline stuff

696.48 --> 698.72
uh

700.56 --> 704.64
i don't think my uh my body's

704.72 --> 707.76
yeah alkaline level or acid level is

707.2 --> 717.839
really

707.76 --> 717.8389999999999
the issue

720.72 --> 724.9590000000001
okay george sanford i don't know why

722.959 --> 726.8
that's

724.959 --> 731.8389999999999
yeah why you even picked up on that what

726.8 --> 731.8389999999999
what does that have to do with the other

735.76 --> 745.8389999999999
anyway hey dank

760.72 --> 768.0
so right well i'm gonna do the same as

763.76 --> 768.0
yesterday so i'm open for questions

768.16 --> 772.0
uh yeah i missed a lot of yesterday

771.68 --> 775.519
because

772.0 --> 778.0
again i went to bed very early i felt i

775.519 --> 778.0
needed it

780.24 --> 783.6
didn't watch any movies

784.56 --> 791.04
i did oh yeah i bumped into this very

787.519 --> 791.04
hilarious silly article

798.399 --> 802.079
yeah apparently now

802.24 --> 808.5600000000001
in maine america

806.0 --> 809.44
somebody ordered the restaurant stuff to

808.56 --> 812.959
wear

809.44 --> 816.72
well they call that dog

812.959 --> 818.6389999999999
collars or like those caps

816.72 --> 820.8000000000001
when they yeah they're not supposed to

818.639 --> 822.639
lick like wounds or [ __ ]

820.8 --> 824.639
and they're now force forcing people to

822.639 --> 827.6800000000001
wear that

824.639 --> 828.0
and there's like a photo that'll pop up

827.68 --> 832.88
right

828.0 --> 832.88
away it's i just thought it was so

835.36 --> 843.839
crazy yeah cone

843.92 --> 847.04
so yeah i'm bumping into that sort of

846.24 --> 850.72
silly [ __ ]

847.04 --> 852.16
a lot you know if i paid more attention

850.72 --> 854.32
to this i could probably

852.16 --> 856.0
almost do like short sketches like own

854.32 --> 857.839
benjamin does sometimes

856.0 --> 861.199
like the pictures he picks up that are

857.839 --> 863.1990000000001
just so hilarious or ridiculous and

861.199 --> 865.8389999999999
because there's plenty to go around

863.199 --> 865.8389999999999
these days

866.8 --> 870.079
at that same time you know this this

869.199 --> 872.16
does look very

870.079 --> 873.4399999999999
funny but then i realized it's not

872.16 --> 876.48
really funny

873.44 --> 879.44
because these people are just

876.48 --> 880.88
like they're just trying to not lose

879.44 --> 884.32
their jobs

880.88 --> 888.56
and they're being humiliated like

884.32 --> 891.9200000000001
really really humiliated

888.56 --> 894.6389999999999
and that kind of for me takes the ha ha

891.92 --> 896.16
it's so funny that that they're doing

894.639 --> 898.16
that because

896.16 --> 900.399
they're not proud of that i can assure

898.16 --> 900.399
you

901.44 --> 908.8800000000001
i bet they're not like who at this point

905.76 --> 912.0
is going to really think that that's

908.88 --> 915.4399999999999
a good thing it's uh so

912.0 --> 919.36
i get a bit i guess a bit

915.44 --> 922.8000000000001
down over that when i think about it

919.36 --> 924.48
just so much humiliation and nobody

922.8 --> 927.519
wants it

924.48 --> 931.04
it's really like a psychological attack

927.519 --> 934.48
from the corporate and government

931.04 --> 936.24
and media system the conspiracy of these

934.48 --> 938.24
people doing this together

936.24 --> 941.6
against the people against all the

938.24 --> 946.0790000000001
people everyone

941.6 --> 948.5600000000001
no exception except maybe they're

946.079 --> 949.8389999999999
closed elite party [ __ ] or whatever but

948.56 --> 954.56
i i wonder if

949.839 --> 955.0400000000001
they will be impervious to that kind of

954.56 --> 958.7199999999999
and

955.04 --> 958.7199999999999
enforcing nonsense rules

964.399 --> 968.0
it's so weird because now i'm thinking

966.32 --> 970.48
like what if

968.0 --> 972.16
like a year ago i would have actually

970.48 --> 975.6800000000001
gotten some kind of job

972.16 --> 978.56
something you know i might have

975.68 --> 979.7589999999999
i might now be doing if that were the

978.56 --> 982.079
case

979.759 --> 982.9590000000001
i might now be doing evening shows

982.079 --> 987.199
instead of

982.959 --> 987.199
afternoon shows and then

987.36 --> 992.24
yeah who knows if i would have been

990.24 --> 993.6800000000001
confronted with this kind of nonsense as

992.24 --> 995.6
well

993.68 --> 997.7589999999999
like what in that job would i've been

995.6 --> 1000.8000000000001
forced to wear a mask or

997.759 --> 1004.639
or or be fired or something

1000.8 --> 1006.079
or would the job just be cancelled

1004.639 --> 1008.0790000000001
because the whole thing doesn't work

1006.079 --> 1011.8389999999999
anymore

1008.079 --> 1011.8389999999999
you know

1012.48 --> 1015.36
but anyway

1022.959 --> 1039.839
i don't know what luciferis is

1026.64 --> 1039.8390000000002
rob h i have no idea

1056.559 --> 1064.48
what george said what are you saying

1059.679 --> 1068.5590000000002
they run on hydrogen in the air what

1064.48 --> 1071.1200000000001
are you saying they literally

1068.559 --> 1073.039
extract the hydrogen out of the regular

1071.12 --> 1081.84
air

1073.039 --> 1081.84
is there even enough of it in there

1088.24 --> 1092.4
it's a light emitting substance

1092.84 --> 1098.0
yuck

1095.2 --> 1098.0
what the [ __ ]

1098.799 --> 1102.72
yeah i don't care man they're not

1100.72 --> 1104.0
sticking that [ __ ] in me and if they're

1102.72 --> 1106.72
literally going to make

1104.0 --> 1108.559
everything impossible if you don't then

1106.72 --> 1110.799
i'm gonna organize everything to

1108.559 --> 1112.48
burn them all down and then yeah they

1110.799 --> 1113.2
may have a response and they may just

1112.48 --> 1116.72
simply

1113.2 --> 1117.2
kill everyone they're not gonna get

1116.72 --> 1123.3600000000001
anything

1117.2 --> 1125.6000000000001
back from it no control no

1123.36 --> 1126.4799999999998
because yeah you're not gonna force me

1125.6 --> 1130.1599999999999
to to do

1126.48 --> 1133.2
to to transhumanize myself

1130.16 --> 1137.8400000000001
just to go along with

1133.2 --> 1137.8400000000001
basic living it's not gonna happen

1137.919 --> 1145.1200000000001
i'm not gonna just be passive about it

1142.72 --> 1145.1200000000001
really

1148.96 --> 1154.96
and i am going to

1152.0 --> 1155.6
yeah talk with other people and and

1154.96 --> 1157.76
basically

1155.6 --> 1160.32
express this and tell them like if

1157.76 --> 1162.72
you're just gonna sit by

1160.32 --> 1164.559
while they build a prison around you

1162.72 --> 1168.4
then you will die

1164.559 --> 1169.52
miserable very very miserable about

1168.4 --> 1172.72
yourself about

1169.52 --> 1176.96
cowardice so yeah

1172.72 --> 1179.3600000000001
this giant thing is not gonna continue

1176.96 --> 1181.28
not without some serious serious

1179.36 --> 1184.3999999999999
repercussions

1181.28 --> 1187.6789999999999
to the organizers and not

1184.4 --> 1190.799
afterwards not afterward no no no no no

1187.679 --> 1191.6000000000001
midway it's not going to you're they're

1190.799 --> 1194.08
not going to

1191.6 --> 1196.3999999999999
just do it on everything basically

1194.08 --> 1198.799
implant [ __ ] change everything

1196.4 --> 1199.6000000000001
kill giant amounts of people and then

1198.799 --> 1204.84
it's going to be here

1199.6 --> 1208.8799999999999
no no no no no no

1204.84 --> 1208.8799999999999
no you know

1208.96 --> 1215.52
and i will do my best

1212.48 --> 1218.4
to help ensure there's not going to be

1215.52 --> 1219.679
an afterword response no it's going to

1218.4 --> 1234.0800000000002
be before

1219.679 --> 1236.0800000000002
before the end

1234.08 --> 1238.48
because yeah i don't think that this

1236.08 --> 1241.52
[ __ ] can just continue

1238.48 --> 1241.52
it's intolerable

1242.24 --> 1246.4
it's only destructive there's nothing

1245.28 --> 1249.6
good that come

1246.4 --> 1252.4
can come out of this

1249.6 --> 1253.9189999999999
this crazy scenario with false

1252.4 --> 1257.3600000000001
narratives and false

1253.919 --> 1260.24
signs false medical issues and just

1257.36 --> 1260.24
evil people

1260.4 --> 1264.64
trying to clamp down on everything it's

1262.24 --> 1268.4
there is no

1264.64 --> 1271.039
practical spiritual any use

1268.4 --> 1274.799
for it whatsoever that is can contribute

1271.039 --> 1274.799
in any positive way to the world

1275.679 --> 1279.52
it's all just waste wasted time waste

1278.799 --> 1282.799
the money

1279.52 --> 1286.1589999999999
waste of resources

1282.799 --> 1288.1589999999999
it's a complete waste and must stop very

1286.159 --> 1291.5200000000002
quickly

1288.159 --> 1295.7600000000002
and then literally be forced out

1291.52 --> 1298.4
forced out of the media like no

1295.76 --> 1300.0
you are now going to stop this you're

1298.4 --> 1301.8400000000001
not going to talk about this [ __ ]

1300.0 --> 1306.48
narrative anymore

1301.84 --> 1309.12
these organizations have to be arrested

1306.48 --> 1311.44
have to be arrested everywhere in the

1309.12 --> 1311.4399999999998
world

1311.6 --> 1321.9189999999999
it's got to be stopped

1319.84 --> 1324.559
yeah while you're at it why don't you

1321.919 --> 1333.8400000000001
make biowarfare laboratories

1324.559 --> 1333.84
worldwide illegal how about that

1336.72 --> 1347.84
that will be a great start

1349.48 --> 1354.72
hho is great it will end november 3rd

1358.84 --> 1365.84
what

1360.96 --> 1370.08
yeah lost now rob h government policies

1365.84 --> 1373.28
are not laws for laws contradicts

1370.08 --> 1375.12
the constitution it's not a law it's a

1373.28 --> 1379.9189999999999
policy and it's based on

1375.12 --> 1382.32
voluntary acceptance and that's a fact

1379.919 --> 1385.2
if you don't realize that then you make

1382.32 --> 1385.2
it your own law

1387.44 --> 1391.919
own the elections right

1395.6 --> 1400.1589999999999
right but unfortunately even the

1398.48 --> 1403.28
constitution

1400.159 --> 1406.7990000000002
doesn't mean that thugs out there

1403.28 --> 1410.72
organized thug groups cannot

1406.799 --> 1414.799
basically have badges and enforce

1410.72 --> 1417.52
policy based on false things

1414.799 --> 1417.84
if you think that that is law if you

1417.52 --> 1420.72
think

1417.84 --> 1422.3999999999999
they are valid in what they do yeah then

1420.72 --> 1425.1200000000001
to you it will be law you will be

1422.4 --> 1429.2
subjected to their authority by your own

1425.12 --> 1430.0
consent based on a misunderstanding of

1429.2 --> 1433.3600000000001
how things really

1430.0 --> 1436.48
work if you don't then

1433.36 --> 1439.84
they're still just thugs that yeah

1436.48 --> 1440.799
will enforce with violence if necessary

1439.84 --> 1443.039
in their mind

1440.799 --> 1445.44
that's how they've been trained so it

1443.039 --> 1448.8799999999999
doesn't mean that you can just

1445.44 --> 1452.0800000000002
defy them no no they're still

1448.88 --> 1453.7600000000002
just going to do that [ __ ] anyway so you

1452.08 --> 1457.36
gotta just treat them as

1453.76 --> 1461.6
thugs get out of their way

1457.36 --> 1465.36
quickly don't get involved

1461.6 --> 1466.799
with police [ __ ] concerning yeah corona

1465.36 --> 1470.7199999999998
or even

1466.799 --> 1470.72
whatever you know what i mean

1471.2 --> 1474.559
so that's how i treat it you know and

1474.08 --> 1477.9189999999999
hey

1474.559 --> 1479.6
over here the police are

1477.919 --> 1481.8400000000001
decent enough although i'm getting

1479.6 --> 1483.84
stories from

1481.84 --> 1486.48
the hague that they've been roughing up

1483.84 --> 1488.799
protesters anti-corona protesters pretty

1486.48 --> 1488.799
bad

1489.36 --> 1492.3999999999999
i wasn't there though

1494.799 --> 1498.48
but yeah i'm not very happy to hear

1496.4 --> 1499.2
about it although yeah i'm at least glad

1498.48 --> 1515.84
that people

1499.2 --> 1515.8400000000001
are trying to protest against it

1516.64 --> 1529.8400000000001
all right

1536.88 --> 1541.279
viable vaccine are you listening to

1539.12 --> 1544.6399999999999
yourself the fussler

1541.279 --> 1548.0
how many viable vaccines

1544.64 --> 1548.0
do you think really exist

1548.159 --> 1550.88
with anything

1552.159 --> 1556.96
how many viable vaccines are

1554.84 --> 1559.6789999999999
administered

1556.96 --> 1559.679
these days

1560.159 --> 1564.96
do you think now of course i'm not

1563.84 --> 1567.84
talking about

1564.96 --> 1568.96
yeah it should take a certain time to

1567.84 --> 1572.24
theoretically

1568.96 --> 1574.96
get an actual vaccine together yeah

1572.24 --> 1576.4
yeah but does that mean that it will be

1574.96 --> 1579.919
that

1576.4 --> 1584.48
is any of this actually based on any

1579.919 --> 1588.48
real data of any sort i don't think so

1584.48 --> 1591.1200000000001
this is just open house experimentation

1588.48 --> 1592.08
with my mind control psychological

1591.12 --> 1594.7199999999998
enforcement

1592.08 --> 1596.3999999999999
to trick people into thinking that they

1594.72 --> 1599.44
have to do it

1596.4 --> 1602.48
it's open yeah

1599.44 --> 1605.76
open experimentation

1602.48 --> 1609.1200000000001
like they say the freaking vaccine will

1605.76 --> 1612.559
genetically alter you on a permanent

1609.12 --> 1615.6789999999999
basis okay is that a

1612.559 --> 1618.1589999999999
viable vaccine in your mind is that

1615.679 --> 1622.24
really a good idea

1618.159 --> 1622.24
open experimentation

1624.559 --> 1630.8799999999999
yeah there is no real disease

1627.679 --> 1632.64
that's right although hey if they inject

1630.88 --> 1635.7600000000002
something in you oh you could

1632.64 --> 1641.8400000000001
damn well get sick trust me because yeah

1635.76 --> 1641.84
it's bypassing the normal barriers

1649.12 --> 1652.84
right actually i've even been thinking

1651.12 --> 1656.2399999999998
about this

1652.84 --> 1660.72
carefully right so

1656.24 --> 1662.72
the whole idea of bacterial warfare of

1660.72 --> 1664.559
like spreading a disease through like a

1662.72 --> 1668.159
cloud or something right

1664.559 --> 1669.84
well this does not make a whole lot of

1668.159 --> 1674.72
sense

1669.84 --> 1677.6789999999999
that that bacteria even

1674.72 --> 1678.159
let alone viruses could be delivered

1677.679 --> 1680.799
through

1678.159 --> 1682.24
airborne spraying you know because

1680.799 --> 1685.44
that's been like

1682.24 --> 1686.0
ideas as well among the chemtrails and

1685.44 --> 1689.279
all that and

1686.0 --> 1692.399
yeah of course the morgellons disease

1689.279 --> 1696.24
could potentially but that's those are

1692.399 --> 1698.7199999999998
particles once they literally settle

1696.24 --> 1700.159
they start to get if yeah effective and

1698.72 --> 1701.919
start doing things and you get more

1700.159 --> 1703.6000000000001
gallons disease now i could imagine that

1701.919 --> 1708.0800000000002
that could be sprayed

1703.6 --> 1709.84
it was also an experiment but bacteria

1708.08 --> 1712.559
think about it that's completely

1709.84 --> 1716.32
illogical it could never be

1712.559 --> 1719.36
transmitted airborne through spraying

1716.32 --> 1722.6399999999999
you know why because it's uh

1719.36 --> 1725.9189999999999
it's all gonna die it's gonna die it's

1722.64 --> 1728.3200000000002
gonna be in the open sky it's going to

1725.919 --> 1731.679
be killed by the sunlight

1728.32 --> 1735.36
there's no bacteria out there

1731.679 --> 1738.88
or viruses that can survive

1735.36 --> 1742.6399999999999
sunlight it's a natural disinfectant

1738.88 --> 1744.0390000000002
so yeah it the only way this kind of

1742.64 --> 1746.96
weird

1744.039 --> 1749.52
microbiological hazard potential assumed

1746.96 --> 1753.919
to be hazard can only spread

1749.52 --> 1756.08
is through direct injection

1753.919 --> 1758.48
and it just makes you think again it's

1756.08 --> 1760.72
like direct exposure you know direct a

1758.48 --> 1762.08
droplet from one person to the other in

1760.72 --> 1765.2
theory

1762.08 --> 1765.52
or by yeah having a substance literally

1765.2 --> 1768.64
just

1765.52 --> 1769.679
injected in you and that just makes me

1768.64 --> 1773.76
think that

1769.679 --> 1776.48
even more more than anything else that

1773.76 --> 1779.76
a lot of these supposed infectious

1776.48 --> 1783.52
diseases and the flu and all that

1779.76 --> 1786.72
only exist and persist to

1783.52 --> 1789.9189999999999
continue to come back only

1786.72 --> 1792.159
because of vaccines

1789.919 --> 1795.919
i think that if vaccines would be

1792.159 --> 1799.2
completely cut out completely cut out

1795.919 --> 1801.2
i think the amount of diseases

1799.2 --> 1802.3990000000001
that would yeah would basically get

1801.2 --> 1806.48
around

1802.399 --> 1809.6
would become so minimal that actual flu

1806.48 --> 1813.039
would become rare

1809.6 --> 1813.039
it would become very rare

1813.75 --> 1816.789
[Music]

1817.6 --> 1821.76
and i think that counts for almost every

1819.52 --> 1826.24
disease

1821.76 --> 1829.6
and hey consider this

1826.24 --> 1832.72
how many infectious diseases would

1829.6 --> 1834.9599999999998
periodically exist

1832.72 --> 1836.72
way back in the day or was it more like

1834.96 --> 1840.559
hey something extreme

1836.72 --> 1843.1200000000001
happens or war or something or

1840.559 --> 1844.799
disaster and then after a period

1843.12 --> 1846.0
suddenly everybody becomes sick for a

1844.799 --> 1847.679
while

1846.0 --> 1850.08
and then it goes away again there's no

1847.679 --> 1853.2
[ __ ] vaccine or [ __ ]

1850.08 --> 1855.6789999999999
people just take a couple of vitamin c

1853.2 --> 1856.32
some fresh lemon juice or honey or

1855.679 --> 1859.1200000000001
whatever

1856.32 --> 1860.559
the herbs they got locally and then it's

1859.12 --> 1864.08
over they don't need

1860.559 --> 1868.08
freaking vaccines because it's

1864.08 --> 1868.08
it more has to do with morality

1868.32 --> 1874.48
than with yeah agents or

1871.6 --> 1876.08
separate entities going around micro

1874.48 --> 1880.96
entities going around and

1876.08 --> 1880.96
invading people it's just not what it is

1882.48 --> 1886.159
so i think that if vaccines would just

1884.48 --> 1888.3990000000001
be removed that

1886.159 --> 1891.44
diseases would become quite rare and you

1888.399 --> 1891.4399999999998
know why because

1891.6 --> 1896.8799999999999
all the original conditions that would

1894.72 --> 1898.96
make diseases pretty bad have pretty

1896.88 --> 1902.48
much been removed

1898.96 --> 1904.96
we got basic hygienics now we got

1902.48 --> 1906.799
good trash care we got sewers we got all

1904.96 --> 1910.0
this stuff

1906.799 --> 1911.76
that only in the worst or most damaged

1910.0 --> 1913.519
third world countries they don't have

1911.76 --> 1914.64
and that's where they still have lots of

1913.519 --> 1917.84
disease

1914.64 --> 1919.1200000000001
because those are the cause not some

1917.84 --> 1922.8799999999999
freaking micro

1919.12 --> 1925.4399999999998
agent that plans behind her back to

1922.88 --> 1928.88
invade humanity once again

1925.44 --> 1931.2
no that's not what it is it never was

1928.88 --> 1931.2
that

1932.24 --> 1936.88
it's always about living conditions

1934.08 --> 1936.8799999999999
about hygiene

1936.96 --> 1943.8400000000001
about yeah toxic

1940.24 --> 1945.44
substances in the air in the water in

1943.84 --> 1949.6789999999999
the food

1945.44 --> 1952.1200000000001
those are the real cause of disease

1949.679 --> 1954.0
and those might make you vulnerable to

1952.12 --> 1956.4799999999998
microorganisms that might

1954.0 --> 1957.039
i don't know grow a little bit out of

1956.48 --> 1959.1200000000001
hand

1957.039 --> 1961.039
you know if you eat too much sugar then

1959.12 --> 1963.6
the fungi

1961.039 --> 1965.6
that typically feeds on byproducts of

1963.6 --> 1969.1999999999998
that sugar that is in your system

1965.6 --> 1973.12
it will start to flourish no

1969.2 --> 1976.24
but yeah it has a function it's there

1973.12 --> 1978.8799999999999
if you just don't poison yourself

1976.24 --> 1980.72
then that doesn't happen because it's

1978.88 --> 1982.96
just

1980.72 --> 1984.88
yeah those things are not invading

1982.96 --> 1989.3600000000001
agents they're risk they're always

1984.88 --> 1991.679
responding to your body's condition

1989.36 --> 1993.6
it's like they're waiting until somebody

1991.679 --> 1996.0
yeah until there's just a a certain

1993.6 --> 1999.6
resource that that organism

1996.0 --> 2002.08
typically deals with eats

1999.6 --> 2004.08
and then and then they come in then they

2002.08 --> 2006.08
start to multiply and get in the way

2004.08 --> 2008.1589999999999
maybe produce byproducts toxic

2006.08 --> 2010.8799999999999
byproducts that your body

2008.159 --> 2012.3990000000001
will actually become sick of it's

2010.88 --> 2014.7990000000002
usually the byproduct of the

2012.399 --> 2018.0
microorganisms

2014.799 --> 2022.0
if your body is in yeah has asymmetrical

2018.0 --> 2022.0
situations if it's polluted somehow

2023.6 --> 2033.84
or we have too much sugar anyway

2034.72 --> 2039.1200000000001
so yeah the corona vaccine it's the

2037.6 --> 2041.9189999999999
worst idea ever

2039.12 --> 2043.279
it's a it's a science fiction dystopia

2041.919 --> 2048.399
idea

2043.279 --> 2048.399
that is like cartoon villain level

2052.24 --> 2055.919
anybody that would willingly take such a

2054.56 --> 2059.2799999999997
thing would literally

2055.919 --> 2063.44
be out of their minds out of

2059.28 --> 2065.679
their minds were so unbelievably naive

2063.44 --> 2067.52
that they effectively would be out of

2065.679 --> 2075.839
their minds

2067.52 --> 2075.839
in their naivety

2080.56 --> 2084.7999999999997
why can't you just cough a bit if it

2082.879 --> 2087.7599999999998
spreads like they say

2084.8 --> 2089.2000000000003
because it doesn't it's all lies doesn't

2087.76 --> 2093.119
spread like they say

2089.2 --> 2096.24
my roommate right now has been tested

2093.119 --> 2096.96
for corona and it was tested positive

2096.24 --> 2099.5989999999997
and she is

2096.96 --> 2100.0
like a little bit coughing and all that

2099.599 --> 2102.8
and

2100.0 --> 2103.92
yeah that means i'm going to be sitting

2102.8 --> 2105.599
in between that

2103.92 --> 2107.52
in the bathroom we're going to be

2105.599 --> 2109.92
sharing and all that

2107.52 --> 2112.8
and so that's why i tanked up on zinc

2109.92 --> 2115.119
because i know that helps

2112.8 --> 2116.48
just helps in the general condition it

2115.119 --> 2119.2000000000003
doesn't mean that i'm gonna

2116.48 --> 2122.56
effectively get the symptoms though you

2119.2 --> 2125.839
know if i would be demoralized

2122.56 --> 2127.7599999999998
and not eating very healthy yeah

2125.839 --> 2129.119
then there's a great chance that i would

2127.76 --> 2132.0
get the same

2129.119 --> 2132.0
type of symptom

2132.56 --> 2138.24
that's right but that's more

2135.44 --> 2138.2400000000002
psychosomatic

2139.2 --> 2144.16
and the organisms in my body which just

2142.079 --> 2145.8390000000004
naturally are there would get a signal

2144.16 --> 2147.44
through the psychosomatics like yeah

2145.839 --> 2148.48
now's the time to trigger now is the

2147.44 --> 2151.44
time to do that

2148.48 --> 2152.96
to clean up the clean house if you need

2151.44 --> 2153.76
that if you don't need to clean house

2152.96 --> 2156.7200000000003
because you

2153.76 --> 2158.96
tinkered yourself very carefully then it

2156.72 --> 2161.68
will simply not happen

2158.96 --> 2164.8
there is no cleanup process required in

2161.68 --> 2164.7999999999997
order to trigger that

2170.839 --> 2173.839
see

2184.839 --> 2187.839
hmm

2190.72 --> 2195.1189999999997
nice

2191.97 --> 2198.7999999999997
[Music]

2195.119 --> 2198.8
yeah how about the plague being found

2199.119 --> 2205.28
well the plague thrives on

2202.88 --> 2205.28
[ __ ]

2206.24 --> 2209.9199999999996
crap and blood

2210.0 --> 2213.04
you know what is typically associated

2212.72 --> 2216.3999999999996
with

2213.04 --> 2219.2
rats and fleas you remember

2216.4 --> 2220.56
rats and fleas is what spread the plague

2219.2 --> 2222.72
they killed the cats through the

2220.56 --> 2225.44
superstition so they say

2222.72 --> 2226.839
and that yeah made it worse rats and

2225.44 --> 2230.16
fleas

2226.839 --> 2232.7999999999997
means bites open wounds

2230.16 --> 2233.92
means fishies from the rats spreading

2232.8 --> 2237.92
around everywhere

2233.92 --> 2237.92
see species

2238.079 --> 2243.28
open blood situations yeah the plague

2240.96 --> 2245.44
that's

2243.28 --> 2248.079
but the plague is an actual confirmed

2245.44 --> 2248.079
bacteria

2248.72 --> 2252.64
if i if i'm not mistaken

2255.68 --> 2260.48
so that's why cali has the plague that's

2257.52 --> 2264.079
right there's [ __ ] everywhere

2260.48 --> 2264.079
and there's plenty of wounds

2264.24 --> 2266.72
rats

2268.32 --> 2273.04
bombs [ __ ] on the streets sticking

2271.359 --> 2275.68
needles in their arms and

2273.04 --> 2277.44
leaving them around yeah the conditions

2275.68 --> 2285.839
are all there

2277.44 --> 2285.839
the plague

2299.76 --> 2304.4
yeah mr mansa isn't that just special

2309.2 --> 2315.7599999999998
but it's an insane world though you know

2312.72 --> 2318.7999999999997
if the guy that made the freaking test

2315.76 --> 2320.7200000000003
literally tells him this doesn't work it

2318.8 --> 2323.119
only works

2320.72 --> 2324.0
to give a result of what is literally

2323.119 --> 2327.28
asked for

2324.0 --> 2328.079
by the the one that ordered it but it

2327.28 --> 2331.44
doesn't

2328.079 --> 2335.6800000000003
it can't do what they think

2331.44 --> 2336.0
and say it would do and the designer of

2335.68 --> 2339.04
it

2336.0 --> 2340.079
made that and they took it anyway they

2339.04 --> 2342.88
took it anyway

2340.079 --> 2345.2000000000003
and yeah thousands of productions and

2342.88 --> 2350.2400000000002
everybody has to use it

2345.2 --> 2350.24
it's it's just beyond belief

2351.359 --> 2355.839
that sort of thing makes me violently

2354.72 --> 2359.4399999999996
angry

2355.839 --> 2362.88
that that is allowed when that is all

2359.44 --> 2366.2400000000002
said and done it's unbelievable

2362.88 --> 2368.839
like the person that said yes

2366.24 --> 2370.0
put out the orders should be

2368.839 --> 2373.04
incarcerated

2370.0 --> 2374.56
immediately and put in a freaking mental

2373.04 --> 2378.64
institution

2374.56 --> 2383.839
and sued for the maximum

2378.64 --> 2383.839
in whatever order

2385.2 --> 2391.9199999999996
see people that yeah

2388.32 --> 2395.44
that do such things should be arrested

2391.92 --> 2398.32
immediately immediately and put in a

2395.44 --> 2400.8
mental institution

2398.32 --> 2400.8
at least

2406.16 --> 2411.359
and yeah if that it doesn't happen

2409.28 --> 2413.8390000000004
then the people that are sitting around

2411.359 --> 2416.56
there that are tied in with that

2413.839 --> 2416.56
they should be

2416.96 --> 2421.359
well they should should be next it's

2418.88 --> 2423.04
like yeah yeah you know all this

2421.359 --> 2426.319
and you're going along with it you're

2423.04 --> 2429.599
letting it all happen why exactly

2426.319 --> 2432.24
why money you say okay well

2429.599 --> 2432.8
that's nice you can all give that money

2432.24 --> 2437.4399999999996
then

2432.8 --> 2440.7200000000003
to us it's a damage claim

2437.44 --> 2444.48
for the insanity that you wreaked

2440.72 --> 2446.48
on the world you know nobody should be

2444.48 --> 2448.2400000000002
allowed to make a profit out of the

2446.48 --> 2451.76
covet hoax

2448.24 --> 2456.7999999999997
inside not outside you know

2451.76 --> 2456.8
not outside inside the insiders

2458.48 --> 2461.599
when this all ends they should all hand

2461.119 --> 2467.839
in

2461.599 --> 2467.839
every single cent every single cent

2472.72 --> 2477.04
and they can pay for all the funerals

2474.4 --> 2477.04
with that money

2478.839 --> 2481.839
barely

2492.839 --> 2495.839
do

2508.8 --> 2511.04
[ __ ]

2515.04 --> 2518.4
i don't know what you're blabbering

2516.319 --> 2523.839
about

2518.4 --> 2523.839
rj is in the house

2539.359 --> 2543.68
i don't know a good server

2548.8 --> 2554.079
she might be busy like in a new job or

2551.68 --> 2557.52
something you know she had been moving

2554.079 --> 2559.3590000000004
she was in in the middle of that

2557.52 --> 2562.0
and yeah i don't know i haven't heard

2559.359 --> 2566.7999999999997
from her in a while as well i did

2562.0 --> 2569.92
skype call or skype her some messages

2566.8 --> 2573.92
it seems that she was at least

2569.92 --> 2579.839
on line three hours ago

2573.92 --> 2579.839
but she's just very busy i think

2590.839 --> 2593.839
ah

2599.359 --> 2603.2
i know mr mensah i know look the amount

2602.64 --> 2605.92
of

2603.2 --> 2609.359
videos doctor testimonies about the

2605.92 --> 2612.4
whole situation with everything

2609.359 --> 2614.16
it's like yeah the test

2612.4 --> 2617.76
hey it's even been suggested that the

2614.16 --> 2617.7599999999998
test actually gives you

2619.44 --> 2623.76
a disease or will typically trigger

2622.24 --> 2624.319
symptoms or however you're going to see

2623.76 --> 2628.6400000000003
that

2624.319 --> 2631.119
it is said that it actually spreads it

2628.64 --> 2632.0
i don't know if that was with every test

2631.119 --> 2635.359
but as for

2632.0 --> 2638.8
yeah if you're going to be rna

2635.359 --> 2642.96
testing for a virus

2638.8 --> 2644.48
right well if you talk just take a swap

2642.96 --> 2646.64
this is what i learned about if you just

2644.48 --> 2650.2400000000002
take a swap and then just

2646.64 --> 2651.52
test that for rna you can't isolate the

2650.24 --> 2654.0789999999997
viruses

2651.52 --> 2654.96
they don't isolate the viruses in these

2654.079 --> 2657.28
tests

2654.96 --> 2659.839
so it's just going to be the rna of

2657.28 --> 2659.8390000000004
whatever

2660.4 --> 2666.88
so yeah it doesn't work because

2663.44 --> 2667.68
the viruses the presupposed viruses are

2666.88 --> 2677.839
not

2667.68 --> 2677.839
properly isolated in these tests

2680.56 --> 2689.599
yeah oh mr manza i don't know about that

2686.56 --> 2692.7999999999997
i don't think hiv even exists really

2689.599 --> 2695.839
or it's not what they say aids not

2692.8 --> 2700.4
doesn't exist it's more like

2695.839 --> 2702.839
yeah a medical condition you build up

2700.4 --> 2705.839
through extreme toxicity of a certain

2702.839 --> 2705.839
type

2716.839 --> 2733.839
so

2718.079 --> 2733.8390000000004
oh jesus christ not again

2747.92 --> 2761.839
all right

2773.28 --> 2778.2400000000002
huh what get in sick

2778.88 --> 2784.7200000000003
soon may not be the true heat what no no

2783.119 --> 2787.04
the sun doesn't need to be the heat

2784.72 --> 2790.56
source it's the dale it's the light

2787.04 --> 2792.0
so some light and perhaps some of the

2790.56 --> 2794.7999999999997
daylight too

2792.0 --> 2795.92
hitting matter non-transparent matter

2794.8 --> 2803.2000000000003
being absorbed by it

2795.92 --> 2805.76
which creates the heat

2803.2 --> 2807.5989999999997
so the sun is not a heat source at it

2805.76 --> 2810.3190000000004
you know there is no

2807.599 --> 2817.839
getting closer to the sun and then

2810.319 --> 2817.839
absorbing more heat

2851.52 --> 2856.64
okay mr mensah that's weird man

2854.96 --> 2858.079
look i don't know what that exactly

2856.64 --> 2861.2799999999997
means you know maybe they use

2858.079 --> 2865.2000000000003
certain type of proteins

2861.28 --> 2867.0400000000004
that are that were derived from

2865.2 --> 2869.359
people that did have the medical

2867.04 --> 2874.319
condition

2869.359 --> 2874.319
understood to be i don't know

2874.4 --> 2878.2400000000002
how can you even infect a non-living

2877.44 --> 2887.839
thing with

2878.24 --> 2887.839
a disease like that i don't know

2898.839 --> 2901.839
so

2926.839 --> 2931.44
um

2929.2 --> 2943.839
more a question about earth rotation you

2931.44 --> 2943.839
say well there isn't any

2945.52 --> 2950.16
yeah there should be hey look if the

2947.28 --> 2953.52
earth was turning

2950.16 --> 2956.7999999999997
then yeah there would be

2953.52 --> 2960.24
coriolis deviation

2956.8 --> 2963.8390000000004
of objects in the air because

2960.24 --> 2966.8799999999997
air naturally doesn't lockstep move

2963.839 --> 2971.839
with the earth conservation of momentum

2966.88 --> 2971.839
as ballers claim

2973.04 --> 2979.2
it it it might do that if it were in a

2976.64 --> 2979.2
container

2979.92 --> 2986.319
you know in some way but yeah it would

2981.92 --> 2986.319
still be subjected to centrifugals

2986.559 --> 2989.76
all kinds of issues

2990.64 --> 2994.0789999999997
but yeah it's just the earth is not

2992.96 --> 2997.359
spinning

2994.079 --> 3001.599
and the air is definitely not

2997.359 --> 3001.5989999999997
blowing constantly in a singular

3010.839 --> 3013.839
direction

3017.359 --> 3024.0
like a taurus ice barrier dome

3020.8 --> 3024.0
heat cold chase

3025.2 --> 3027.839
no

3037.68 --> 3041.839
at least it's not a literal taurus

3042.319 --> 3048.24
and yeah you have no proof it's it's a

3045.359 --> 3050.0
circle or a circular or a disc

3048.24 --> 3055.839
in a literal sense in a geometrical

3050.0 --> 3055.839
sense either so

3079.44 --> 3083.839
okay getting sick

3089.28 --> 3095.0400000000004
and it's supposed to be just heat that

3092.16 --> 3097.839
moves molecular structures yes

3095.04 --> 3097.839
well it does

3103.52 --> 3107.92
pretty sure the day and night

3105.599 --> 3111.839
temperature differences

3107.92 --> 3111.839
is what keeps the air moving

3123.52 --> 3131.839
no matthew eastman sun rays

3127.359 --> 3131.839
are not evidence of a distance to the

3136.839 --> 3139.839
sun

3143.2 --> 3148.72
because you know why because those rays

3145.76 --> 3152.079
are virtual

3148.72 --> 3155.1189999999997
they are present

3152.079 --> 3159.04
to the observer as

3155.119 --> 3160.96
as they see the race but somebody else

3159.04 --> 3162.16
that might be quite a distance away and

3160.96 --> 3164.839
can still

3162.16 --> 3167.1189999999997
look upon the location of the first

3164.839 --> 3170.96
person whatever they're going to see

3167.119 --> 3172.6400000000003
in some specific sun rays right

3170.96 --> 3175.2
the other observer is not going to see

3172.64 --> 3177.2799999999997
the same thing

3175.2 --> 3179.52
at the same time when looking at that

3177.28 --> 3181.6800000000003
person

3179.52 --> 3183.44
and then looking at whatever the sun

3181.68 --> 3185.1189999999997
rays are going to show

3183.44 --> 3187.92
to them it's not going to be the same

3185.119 --> 3189.44
because the sun rays in themselves are

3187.92 --> 3192.319
virtual

3189.44 --> 3195.359
they are as part of the holographics

3192.319 --> 3199.119
they are like a mirroring effect of the

3195.359 --> 3199.68
alt of the holographics they are derived

3199.119 --> 3202.559
from

3199.68 --> 3204.3999999999996
that they're not in any literal

3202.559 --> 3207.2000000000003
positions

3204.4 --> 3208.559
it's only a virtual position in an

3207.2 --> 3213.68
apparent position

3208.559 --> 3213.6800000000003
to the observer in their location

3221.04 --> 3226.8
you know the only thing that would prove

3224.559 --> 3228.2400000000002
or that would get close to proving a

3226.8 --> 3231.8390000000004
distance

3228.24 --> 3234.8799999999997
is proof of a proximity

3231.839 --> 3237.92
proof that if you move to words

3234.88 --> 3239.52
where you see the apparent sun

3237.92 --> 3241.52
assuming that it is even a physical

3239.52 --> 3244.079
thing if you move towards it that

3241.52 --> 3245.68
the angular size of it will increase

3244.079 --> 3248.6400000000003
consistently

3245.68 --> 3249.04
or that the amount of energy absorbed

3248.64 --> 3252.16
will

3249.04 --> 3256.88
start to increase at a linear

3252.16 --> 3258.319
rate versus that proximity

3256.88 --> 3262.1600000000003
then you got an evidence that you're

3258.319 --> 3263.92
actually or potential evidence at least

3262.16 --> 3266.0
that you're approaching a physical

3263.92 --> 3267.76
object in some way

3266.0 --> 3270.8
because you're getting closer to it its

3267.76 --> 3274.079
angular size increases the amount of

3270.8 --> 3276.559
energy absorbed by you will

3274.079 --> 3277.52
increase as you approach it that would

3276.559 --> 3279.6800000000003
make sense

3277.52 --> 3280.72
fortunately there's no proof or even

3279.68 --> 3283.52
clue to this

3280.72 --> 3283.52
whatsoever

3290.0 --> 3294.799
you can't approach it doesn't seem like

3292.079 --> 3294.799
that at all

3299.839 --> 3307.839
rays only appear because of shadows

3303.04 --> 3307.839
well the ray is the ray

3309.119 --> 3315.599
but yes it becomes more of distinct

3312.64 --> 3317.44
a light ray becomes more distinct if

3315.599 --> 3320.2400000000002
yeah it is

3317.44 --> 3322.64
if what yeah surrounding it things are

3320.24 --> 3322.64
blocked

3346.839 --> 3349.839
reflection

3360.839 --> 3363.839
so

3398.96 --> 3405.839
okie dokie shines good for you

3425.92 --> 3428.4
okay

3429.52 --> 3435.359
oh sorry i hadn't seen that part yet

3431.76 --> 3435.3590000000004
about your mother okay so

3436.48 --> 3442.079
it just i don't know i don't see why you

3438.72 --> 3442.0789999999997
want to associate

3442.48 --> 3446.48
your realization of the sun being a

3445.28 --> 3449.0400000000004
hologram

3446.48 --> 3450.64
with your brother thinking that aliens

3449.04 --> 3461.839
landed in 2012.

3450.64 --> 3461.839
come on

3463.04 --> 3475.839
yeah i'm sorry to hear about your mother

3495.31 --> 3498.5099999999998
[Music]

3500.319 --> 3504.0
yeah welcome to the club getting sick

3504.16 --> 3508.0
i thought my mother was an alien too

3514.839 --> 3517.839
sometimes

3543.119 --> 3546.319
all right shines well yeah that's cool

3545.839 --> 3549.2
you know

3546.319 --> 3551.839
when i look at the sun carefully yeah it

3549.2 --> 3554.72
definitely does just look like a hole

3551.839 --> 3556.839
it it doesn't look like any kind of

3554.72 --> 3560.24
physical object

3556.839 --> 3564.799
ever there's no lamp

3560.24 --> 3564.799
no even the brightest of brightest lamps

3565.04 --> 3570.799
yeah if you stare at it and yeah try

3568.319 --> 3571.359
to be careful it just doesn't look like

3570.799 --> 3574.16
that

3571.359 --> 3575.2
it does not look like the sun there's

3574.16 --> 3577.44
nothing

3575.2 --> 3578.48
nothing out there i've ever seen that

3577.44 --> 3587.839
looks

3578.48 --> 3587.839
just like the sun nothing

3606.64 --> 3608.8799999999997
hmm

3612.319 --> 3616.24
let's see let's see if nathan is going

3614.48 --> 3629.839
