156.05 --> 159.94
yeah I'm open for guests

164.95 --> 168.48
if you would like to share something

183.31 --> 186.75
watched any news and recently

187.37 --> 192.25
everything's still going hard as far as

189.98 --> 192.25
I know

203.86 --> 208.41000000000003
right

205.4 --> 211.08
yeah something

208.41 --> 216.69
like the whole climate stuff climate

211.08 --> 219.03
change they had like a green bill over

216.69 --> 221.4
here and as far as I can tell it's

219.03 --> 223.26
actually passed like I have no idea

221.4 --> 226.83
that's insane

223.26 --> 230.73
and it's causing a huge friction of

226.83 --> 235.59
course because it is insane and there's

230.73 --> 238.47
like I've never seen like in this one

235.59 --> 239.88
stream alternative news that I've been

238.47 --> 244.35
following for a long time have never

239.88 --> 249.06
seen so much criticism on on the the

244.35 --> 251.85
Dutch news organization nos and the

249.06 --> 255.3
weather reporting and that it's like

251.85 --> 256.53
they're yeah what's happening in England

255.3 --> 258.959
England

256.53 --> 260.64
with the BBC seems to be happening in

258.959 --> 263.25
the Netherlands as well up to some

260.64 --> 268.68
degree very curious as to where that's

263.25 --> 270.83
going yellow vests doing stuff a lot of

268.68 --> 270.83
it

271.66 --> 274.23
and

275.919 --> 280.49899999999997
it's just very hard to keep track of it

278.409 --> 280.49899999999997
all

287.27 --> 297.38
you davin good over moco

291.759 --> 301.55
Nathan Oakley yeah I completely missed

297.38 --> 306.259
on the ball busters yesterday I went to

301.55 --> 309.919
bed pretty early somewhere after my

306.259 --> 315.41
elite his most recent uploads and that

309.919 --> 318.54999999999995
was really good I always have fun

315.41 --> 318.55
in history

331.3 --> 334.32
was i doing

346.88 --> 356.79
all right yeah back and forth with

350.16 --> 360.53000000000003
vision then George F let me just read

356.79 --> 364.95000000000005
out out loud when he just said here just

360.53 --> 367.95
so you get what I have to deal with it's

364.95 --> 372.0
talking about the atom and the atom of

367.95 --> 375.34999999999997
helium and he says it contains two

372.0 --> 378.87
subjects in a cylinder called chain in

375.35 --> 382.46000000000004
ethereal field that manifests as to

378.87 --> 382.46
north and to South Poles

386.57 --> 393.55
the atom of helium is perfect balance

389.42 --> 393.55
and that's why it rises in the air

399.9 --> 406.58
he's just thinking in 3d patterns but I

407.0 --> 410.69
know how that is

417.629 --> 423.259
anyway yeah Nathan yeah earlier in the

424.219 --> 431.939
in the Skype chat from ball-busters

427.08 --> 434.12899999999996
I left because I thought that John

431.939 --> 439.34900000000005
quantum eraser was acting like a dick

434.129 --> 444.719
which he does and repenting Lee by the

439.349 --> 447.089
way just for your information but yeah

444.719 --> 455.789
I'm ready to get back in there because I

447.089 --> 458.059
yeah it's alright just if you still have

455.789 --> 458.05899999999997
me

474.33 --> 480.53
not really am i credited in the casting

477.9 --> 480.53
of almost

482.37 --> 487.16
huh I didn't know I didn't even know

484.83 --> 487.15999999999997
that

493.039 --> 495.699
yeah

496.12 --> 500.59000000000003
now I have absolutely no problem with

498.49 --> 505.72
quantum erasers beliefs

500.59 --> 511.40999999999997
I feel pretty sure that the problem is

505.72 --> 511.41
rooted purely in his social behaviors

518.54 --> 525.17
and I'll leave it to that and he knows

521.09 --> 527.2900000000001
it's true but yeah I'm repenting you

525.17 --> 527.29
know

554.13 --> 562.26
right

556.77 --> 566.459
oh yeah sorry for the I don't know I

562.26 --> 570.93
haven't really been working on some real

566.459 --> 574.9399999999999
concepts just minor reflections my

570.93 --> 574.9399999999999
reflections is thinking again about

576.87 --> 582.96
basically what I've heard from many

580.14 --> 587.43
different sources from religious

582.96 --> 593.01
suggestions and from the pattern that

587.43 --> 596.6899999999999
Asian suggests and again from we have

593.01 --> 600.66
what I discovered myself in the past

596.69 --> 604.85
just she just playing with it you know

600.66 --> 604.85
it's more like art artistry

607.4 --> 611.1999999999999
of this matrix references

618.51 --> 622.38
but yeah

620.75 --> 624.84
but

622.38 --> 627.66
now before him it's not something to

624.84 --> 630.69
really just try to explain I need to put

627.66 --> 633.0899999999999
something on paper and then just see

630.69 --> 635.07
what you guys feel about it and I'll be

633.09 --> 639.9
very clear as to what it is and what it

635.07 --> 642.98
is not as to not accidentally put a

639.9 --> 642.98
wizard spell on you

654.37 --> 662.37
so yeah is anybody up for the panel come

658.209 --> 662.3699999999999
on guys and gals

677.709 --> 680.709
what

684.76 --> 687.5699999999999
was that

703.5 --> 706.28
all right

707.6 --> 712.48
I never heard of that day

720.02 --> 727.3
yep so many people

722.8 --> 730.559
in the world so very little I know and

727.3 --> 730.559
everybody knows somebody

736.079 --> 743.2389999999999
never been too much into racing sports

739.55 --> 746.819
just find it a bit freaky like I like

743.239 --> 749.879
fast driving okay I like that

746.819 --> 754.67
but like real racing on the edge kind of

749.879 --> 754.6700000000001
stuff I just find it very dangerous

757.77 --> 763.1999999999999
but yeah that's what they do it for us

759.48 --> 768.29
usually hit people that are into that do

763.2 --> 768.2900000000001
it for the kick but me there

779.27 --> 783.55
yeah that's right thrilling experience

793.19 --> 798.9100000000001
yeah all the formula run that stuff like

799.74 --> 809.16
the thing that I caught from it it's

802.31 --> 810.78
mostly just freaking loud like on the TV

809.16 --> 815.3
it's like every time they come by it's

810.78 --> 820.65
just just freaking giant horde of wasps

815.3 --> 823.3499999999999
well and yeah if truth I know people

820.65 --> 825.72
that are real formula over I knew people

823.35 --> 827.5500000000001
fear fear friends there were real

825.72 --> 830.19
Formula one fans and they would go there

827.55 --> 835.0799999999999
and they would be like death

830.19 --> 837.99
the next day yeah go away eventually but

835.08 --> 841.11
they still enjoy just the giant wall of

837.99 --> 842.55
sound apparently yeah I don't get it I

841.11 --> 843.57
really don't get it I have very

842.55 --> 848.04
sensitive ears

843.57 --> 853.2
I don't like overly loud noises don't

848.04 --> 855.15
like it like typical clubs dancing clubs

853.2 --> 857.88
or whatever where they just put that

855.15 --> 862.9499999999999
music out so insanely loud I hate that

857.88 --> 867.84
it hurts so I don't know but yeah right

862.95 --> 874.7900000000001
just fast driving yeah I get it I can do

867.84 --> 874.7900000000001
it I'm just not gonna overly do it

876.38 --> 880.45
I just wanted to have it as a good skill

882.47 --> 885.22
anyway

890.72 --> 895.73
so yeah now we're talking about Formula

893.15 --> 897.7099999999999
One race driving okay you can help

895.73 --> 903.98
prevent this by actually becoming a

897.71 --> 907.01
guest on my panel so we can have a

903.98 --> 911.1800000000001
decent conversation about an actual

907.01 --> 913.49
subject that's more in the description

911.18 --> 918.9499999999999
box let's just say it like that so it's

913.49 --> 921.37
good to click on show more so you can

918.95 --> 926.5
see all the hashtags and all the typical

921.37 --> 926.5
subjects you could bring up

929.02 --> 936.49
- Tecna for example yeah I got an idea

933.399 --> 940.18
on that I it's been crystallizing

936.49 --> 948.0600000000001
further and I want a freaking neon cap

940.18 --> 952.8
with that [ __ ] neon yellow like super

948.06 --> 952.8
ultra noisy bright

953.96 --> 961.72
and maybe some other versions as well

956.12 --> 961.72
but yeah that's what I'm gonna do

963.89 --> 978.61
Matt Davin good asks what side of the

967.55 --> 983.209
ether are you on yes or no no milkman

978.61 --> 991.25
I'm not gonna fix it now but I will fix

983.209 --> 995.18
it yeah I got my money back from the mic

991.25 --> 998.899
sending it back so fortunately it's

995.18 --> 1003.3389999999999
gonna have to wait until the 24th

998.899 --> 1005.41
something like that then yeah I'll have

1003.339 --> 1010.1800000000001
money available again enough to

1005.41 --> 1013.0889999999999
potentially get it again for slightly

1010.18 --> 1017.68
more but for now yeah you're gonna have

1013.089 --> 1020.2900000000001
to do with this five-year-old mic that

1017.68 --> 1024.51
has been performing here for more than

1020.29 --> 1024.51
three years so you know

1026.039 --> 1034.539
it's cheap but it works that's

1029.819 --> 1039.059
commendable anyway oh yeah

1034.539 --> 1039.059
Nathan hopefully wants the link sure

1058.83 --> 1062.3
all right there you go

1066.92 --> 1074.059
you do Steve really like where I have no

1071.42 --> 1078.559
idea you know I'm kind of a social media

1074.059 --> 1080.99
isolationist in a way very typical yeah

1078.559 --> 1083.12
i murder mid tide but I don't know

1080.99 --> 1085.07
what's going on on Twitter really except

1083.12 --> 1090.4099999999999
for what I hear from my getting for Wars

1085.07 --> 1092.45
or see Artie all those channels that I

1090.41 --> 1094.76
typically follow so I have no idea

1092.45 --> 1095.96
what's like how the trimmings are

1094.76 --> 1101.51
working with the memes

1095.96 --> 1104.1200000000001
I just try to make them up not really

1101.51 --> 1105.679
actively spreading them like technically

1104.12 --> 1110.9499999999998
I could have a Twitter account to do

1105.679 --> 1117.6200000000001
that be like a Mimi Twitter account but

1110.95 --> 1120.549
it's just not really my thing it's to

1117.62 --> 1122.9499999999998
feel so unperson 'el in a way No

1120.549 --> 1129.999
I like YouTube because I can actually be

1122.95 --> 1131.979
myself here in full and find other

1129.999 --> 1136.709
really interesting people and share

1131.979 --> 1136.709
ideas and see how everything evolved

1138.359 --> 1146.649
from our mistakes and everybody learns

1141.909 --> 1152.1390000000001
with us and it's more natural Wow at the

1146.649 --> 1157.299
same time all the acting stuff series

1152.139 --> 1160.629
and all fiction that is being output

1157.299 --> 1165.339
there are actually seemingly more

1160.629 --> 1166.87
becoming more dislocating yeah it's

1165.339 --> 1170.02
going back and forth

1166.87 --> 1170.02
[Applause]

1171.78 --> 1177.87
it's just that the energy what just

1175.14 --> 1181.3100000000002
people having a talk somewhere and

1177.87 --> 1184.56
having people in chat is so different

1181.31 --> 1186.6299999999999
but more down-to-earth compared to like

1184.56 --> 1189.84
watching Netflix in some series there

1186.63 --> 1192.66
because there's always these natural

1189.84 --> 1196.6699999999998
elements about it as part of what they

1192.66 --> 1196.67
do have part of their wizardry and

1202.74 --> 1209.429
yeah to me it feels very manipulative

1205.169 --> 1213.63
most of it and I don't like looking past

1209.429 --> 1216.299
things I do it to try and enjoy the rest

1213.63 --> 1218.159
of it because there are some series out

1216.299 --> 1221.029
there to just have really good

1218.159 --> 1229.1100000000001
interesting character developments very

1221.029 --> 1232.14
beautiful art or very soulful situations

1229.11 --> 1233.9699999999998
like they do do their best to improve

1232.14 --> 1236.539
that but at the same time it's it's

1233.97 --> 1238.89
always the freaking programming and

1236.539 --> 1242.429
things that just start to stick in your

1238.89 --> 1246.21
eye like like a splinter because you

1242.429 --> 1247.919
know so much about the world and you see

1246.21 --> 1253.13
that programming and that's really

1247.919 --> 1253.13
annoying then so

1260.29 --> 1266.1689999999999
but there are some real miracle worker

1263.49 --> 1270.61
series out there they're pretty old and

1266.169 --> 1273.1000000000001
I'm very much a fan of and yeah it's

1270.61 --> 1278.6789999999999
kind of like the the baldur's gate game

1273.1 --> 1280.3899999999999
D&D from the old days 97 I was so

1278.679 --> 1282.94
impressed with that game at the time and

1280.39 --> 1285.179
still AM although yeah it is kind of on

1282.94 --> 1285.179
the edge

1287.55 --> 1293.6599999999999
but that yeah that's what the story of

1289.74 --> 1293.66
that game is about and

1294.8 --> 1299.81
yeah this series is also sort of that

1297.53 --> 1305.06
period I'm talking about Star Trek

1299.81 --> 1305.48
Voyager and I'm just I just really like

1305.06 --> 1309.26
it

1305.48 --> 1311.8700000000001
I guess it's maybe a generational thing

1309.26 --> 1315.23
because I think that I've met many new

1311.87 --> 1319.82
people might just be bored by it or look

1315.23 --> 1325.85
through the kind of tropes but they do

1319.82 --> 1327.37
it very eloquently I think it's not

1325.85 --> 1334.84
perfect

1327.37 --> 1337.57
it's very 90s liberal in a way the music

1334.84 --> 1339.999
is amazing it just start to listen more

1337.57 --> 1343.24
and more and it's like a classical

1339.999 --> 1345.3990000000001
Orchestra that kind of the same feel

1343.24 --> 1350.529
that the baldur's gate music also try to

1345.399 --> 1354.039
embrace and I just wonder like is that a

1350.529 --> 1356.559
real Orchestra playing that life or

1354.039 --> 1358.539
riding it next to it every single

1356.559 --> 1361.45
episode that's really impressive because

1358.539 --> 1363.07
it doesn't seem like a looped thing or

1361.45 --> 1366.1290000000001
anything no it really looks like they

1363.07 --> 1369.73
adapt the music to what's happening very

1366.129 --> 1374.07
precisely and it is super impressive in

1369.73 --> 1376.84
my personal opinion my artistic opinion

1374.07 --> 1378.999
and I like the diversity of the

1376.84 --> 1384.87
characters and how they're worked out

1378.999 --> 1387.27
the concepts of it culture so

1384.87 --> 1390.6299999999999
it's all about culture and about

1387.27 --> 1392.8799999999999
personal experience and looking it from

1390.63 --> 1396.0
many angles they are so freakin liberal

1392.88 --> 1399.24
they they have like shamanistic stuff

1396.0 --> 1403.38
and dream related stuff and psychic

1399.24 --> 1407.49
events that kind of stuff so everything

1403.38 --> 1409.71
is in there and they they try to even

1407.49 --> 1412.3700000000001
philosophize in the spot like okay you

1409.71 --> 1416.25
can see oh that person is crazy or maybe

1412.37 --> 1419.84
it's just tuned into another frequency

1416.25 --> 1423.299
of it all it is it embraces religious

1419.84 --> 1425.37
thinking and mysticism it's a lot

1423.299 --> 1429.539
there's so much in there it's just sorry

1425.37 --> 1431.399
I'm gushing I'm a fan of that series and

1429.539 --> 1433.169
I like the actors a lot and I like the

1431.399 --> 1440.01
characters a lot and I like the music a

1433.169 --> 1446.3400000000001
lot and yeah in that galaxy space is a

1440.01 --> 1449.46
very very rich in adventurous place got

1446.34 --> 1451.86
so many of these weird phenomena happen

1449.46 --> 1456.24
everywhere and they I got like maps of

1451.86 --> 1458.2199999999998
different types of distortions and it's

1456.24 --> 1458.909
seemingly everywhere everywhere

1458.22 --> 1465.5
everywhere

1458.909 --> 1469.7600000000002
so that is really sci-fi about it but

1465.5 --> 1474.2
I think it's a very well-crafted

1469.76 --> 1476.71
painting yeah Star Trek Voyager it's

1474.2 --> 1476.71
kind of old

1479.88 --> 1483.2600000000002
and they really

1486.57 --> 1496.619
they what Voyager did very well was kind

1493.019 --> 1500.389
of like what Babylon 5 did also Babylon

1496.619 --> 1500.389
5 is a completely different series

1500.809 --> 1506.729
there's a lot of Jewish influences but

1503.489 --> 1513.719
like positive ones actually it's really

1506.729 --> 1515.6090000000002
fascinating series but yeah what made

1513.719 --> 1520.169
that series so special to me

1515.609 --> 1522.9589999999998
was that it evolved it was an e Paz and

1520.169 --> 1526.979
you didn't necessarily realize that at

1522.959 --> 1531.5990000000002
first and every season has a different

1526.979 --> 1534.329
intro and it evolves like the situation

1531.599 --> 1538.619
changes and suddenly like a war starts

1534.329 --> 1543.629
system come up or yeah a purely alien

1538.619 --> 1547.079
war and then suddenly a wider war and an

1543.629 --> 1549.319
important ally or a bigger Empire that's

1547.079 --> 1553.1989999999998
kind of been good suddenly corrupts

1549.319 --> 1556.469
through an alien weird influence it's

1553.199 --> 1559.259
it's fast it's a very big story it's

1556.469 --> 1560.969
very fascinating and voice yeah the

1559.259 --> 1565.079
original Star Trek wasn't like that at

1560.969 --> 1568.709
all it was very episodic 'el just plays

1565.079 --> 1570.389
like every single scene was basically

1568.709 --> 1574.3790000000001
you plated they rarely even had

1570.389 --> 1576.6589999999999
continuation episodes I think mostly

1574.379 --> 1578.7289999999998
doubles sometimes but what every episode

1576.659 --> 1581.279
was a different event not not a lot of

1578.729 --> 1583.699
correlation necessarily well the Voyager

1581.279 --> 1586.829
with Voyager they didn't do that they

1583.699 --> 1589.039
have a progressive line and they have it

1586.829 --> 1593.039
pretty detailed

1589.039 --> 1596.969
like they name the dates they say how

1593.039 --> 1600.029
many years had it has been every time as

1596.969 --> 1601.979
the series progresses rather big steps

1600.029 --> 1604.409
happen in between sometimes but not

1601.979 --> 1607.45
years is usually like a year later is

1604.409 --> 1611.17
the max mostly months

1607.45 --> 1615.13
and they actually do also time

1611.17 --> 1617.5900000000001
adventures with that stuff and really

1615.13 --> 1620.0400000000002
get the details right it is so

1617.59 --> 1625.56
impressive it's so well designed it's

1620.04 --> 1628.3
just used to the maximum potential and

1625.56 --> 1630.37
yeah well Babylon 5 has some time

1628.3 --> 1633.22
influences as well which are very

1630.37 --> 1638.34
impressive it's it's amazing story as

1633.22 --> 1643.81
well but yeah what you did that also and

1638.34 --> 1646.09
developed things like develop the

1643.81 --> 1647.71
technology kind of tried to make some

1646.09 --> 1652.8999999999999
developments in there it is

1647.71 --> 1656.8
still roughly technobabble ish but they

1652.9 --> 1658.8700000000001
try to actually build up and they get

1656.8 --> 1661.18
like bark technology involved with that

1658.87 --> 1663.4799999999998
which I think was awesome as a concept

1661.18 --> 1663.48
and

1664.91 --> 1669.3700000000001
yeah thinking that out like

1669.85 --> 1675.84
yeah I don't know I'm just very

1671.77 --> 1678.49
impressed with the series and now stops

1675.84 --> 1687.4199999999998
whining on about science fiction series

1678.49 --> 1687.42
that I happen to like a lot anyway

1690.45 --> 1693.019
yep

1693.71 --> 1699.43
I concur and why the young noodle says I

1697.28 --> 1702.97
want a green girlfriend

1699.43 --> 1702.97
what do you mean with that

1709.36 --> 1713.07
all right flatten earth

1714.35 --> 1723.08
yeah it is just amazing and it is

1717.38 --> 1730.73
recyclable I think I watched the entire

1723.08 --> 1734.21
series three or four times now and yeah

1730.73 --> 1735.919
you do need a big break in between every

1734.21 --> 1738.3990000000001
time especially if you watched it very

1735.919 --> 1738.3990000000001
focused

1739.75 --> 1745.27
but yeah it Enders the test of time in

1742.45 --> 1748.0800000000002
its quality and it's fascinating the

1745.27 --> 1748.08
synchronicities

1749.58 --> 1755.9089999999999
for you to stumble upon as you wise

1752.399 --> 1761.7299999999998
enough over the over the time over the

1755.909 --> 1766.8890000000001
ages you could say oh yeah the ending I

1761.73 --> 1769.739
I'm not there yet I don't remember but I

1766.889 --> 1773.9399999999998
think I probably agree with you that it

1769.739 --> 1776.489
they abruptly cut it off that was that

1773.94 --> 1781.98
was like a waste there's so much

1776.489 --> 1783.8990000000001
potential as a typical fan as I would

1781.98 --> 1785.519
also kind of did with the matrix I

1783.899 --> 1790.609
thought of like yeah what's gonna happen

1785.519 --> 1795.749
after that and I see Erised like okay

1790.609 --> 1799.6789999999999
Borg versus then the alpha quadrant

1795.749 --> 1802.23
and suddenly yeah there's gonna be an

1799.679 --> 1805.3400000000001
integration with work like human or

1802.23 --> 1808.95
Starfleet will apply Borg technology

1805.34 --> 1812.519
very carefully and then that becomes

1808.95 --> 1817.309
kind of a new standard and then the Borg

1812.519 --> 1821.249
start to like split up into separate

1817.309 --> 1823.47
queen-like factions and suddenly retract

1821.249 --> 1826.44
from assaulting and start to do

1823.47 --> 1830.07
infighting [ __ ] that's what I asked

1826.44 --> 1833.759
about it could be very very interesting

1830.07 --> 1837.779
set up for all kinds of storylines in

1833.759 --> 1842.279
such a world but yeah they didn't do it

1837.779 --> 1847.789
no they're too reven re-envision it all

1842.279 --> 1850.529
starts a whole new angle to it oh goody

1847.789 --> 1854.279
they broke it off but they didn't have

1850.529 --> 1856.619
to it's very good and consistent series

1854.279 --> 1857.429
it was in tune even with deep steps to

1856.619 --> 1862.7389999999998
deep space 9

1857.429 --> 1864.7
loyal to the old material in most ways

1862.739 --> 1866.409
there may be some nerd

1864.7 --> 1868.8400000000001
we'll find a detail that they kind of

1866.409 --> 1871.5700000000002
switched around but yeah it is kind of

1868.84 --> 1876.129
loyal to the old acting crew of the old

1871.57 --> 1880.84
Star Trek and and also of course the

1876.129 --> 1883.809
next generation which preceded it so

1880.84 --> 1886.6
yeah it was an amazing sci-fi universe

1883.809 --> 1889.23
but knew they'd have to do something

1886.6 --> 1889.23
entirely new

1890.309 --> 1902.009
well yeah John Smith I also watched Star

1896.59 --> 1907.809
Trek discovery and I found it find it

1902.009 --> 1913.029
overkill it's kind of good kind of

1907.809 --> 1915.639
unnerving you feel the wizardry

1913.029 --> 1918.34
influences very strongly and it it's

1915.639 --> 1920.9989999999998
just like the art it's kind of

1918.34 --> 1920.999
aggressive

1921.51 --> 1929.52
but I'm still fascinated by the story

1923.97 --> 1934.4
and yeah I do kind of like the

1929.52 --> 1934.4
characters yeah

1935.58 --> 1944.3999999999999
it's not been like oh my god this is

1939.53 --> 1946.26
absolutely freaking amazing but it's too

1944.4 --> 1951.6200000000001
noisy for that but it's still kind of

1946.26 --> 1957.48
good if you can yeah get past all the

1951.62 --> 1961.7299999999998
programming and political choices made

1957.48 --> 1961.73
in the design science

1963.55 --> 1970.32
anyway sci-fi this is the sci-fi talking

1967.42 --> 1970.3200000000002
episode once again

1973.76 --> 1978.71
all right no I get why yeah probably

1976.37 --> 1980.9599999999998
because yesterday morning I watched like

1978.71 --> 1983.39
two episodes and then this evening I

1980.96 --> 1992.15
watched like four or five that's

1983.39 --> 1994.18
probably the reason why yep goes up and

1992.15 --> 1994.18
down

2009.2 --> 2015.74
yeah oh by the way just for the record

2013.25 --> 2023.3
to bring it back a little bit more into

2015.74 --> 2026.9
Flat Earth I'm gonna basically put my

2023.3 --> 2029.06
heels in the sand again I don't know

2026.9 --> 2032.45
it's not even a momentous thing is just

2029.06 --> 2035.9299999999998
a general declaration and say no I don't

2032.45 --> 2038.77
think there's a dome physical dome of

2035.93 --> 2044.05
any kind don't think there's a location

2038.77 --> 2047.86
the heavenly bodies anywhere I think

2044.05 --> 2052.929
they are apparitions light-based

2047.86 --> 2059.62
side effects of specific light emerging

2052.929 --> 2059.62
from that direction basically

2060.94 --> 2063.149
and

2063.69 --> 2067.349
yeah how that works I don't know I've

2065.669 --> 2070.919
tried explain it before I think it's

2067.349 --> 2073.77
like kind of like an energy cloud that

2070.919 --> 2082.19
has a specific wave pattern in some way

2073.77 --> 2086.7599999999998
that causes just coincidentally by its

2082.19 --> 2090.119
form causes the light to manifest in a

2086.76 --> 2091.3190000000004
certain strength from specific angles in

2090.119 --> 2094.1690000000003
relation to the position of the earth

2091.319 --> 2096.7799999999997
it's it's very weird

2094.169 --> 2100.859
but that's kind of how I and visualize

2096.78 --> 2104.789
it that it must just be like critical

2100.859 --> 2107.069
mass of a wave of energy up there and it

2104.789 --> 2113.13
yeah it is very weird how it suggests

2107.069 --> 2115.65
all these points and discs and all that

2113.13 --> 2130.23
light especially the Sun that's the most

2115.65 --> 2131.089
mysterious one hey Nathan Oakley are you

2130.23 --> 2134.099
doing better

2131.089 --> 2139.38
yeah after yesterday 20 minutes a bit in

2134.099 --> 2140.25
your oh sorry I didn't even realize that

2139.38 --> 2145.799
you were there

2140.25 --> 2149.43
I was just rambling on about sci-fi have

2145.799 --> 2152.849
you seen the halos that they have crash

2149.43 --> 2155.52
protection on the f1 cars now then what

2152.849 --> 2157.4700000000003
the crash protection around the driver

2155.52 --> 2162.299
for rollover protection on the left one

2157.47 --> 2164.7
car have you not seen that I think I saw

2162.299 --> 2166.98
that one time it's got a bar right in

2164.7 --> 2170.22
front of the driver's face by blocking

2166.98 --> 2172.65
his feet okay

2170.22 --> 2175.2
just type in f1 I know you were very

2172.65 --> 2179.9100000000003
keen for f1 racing oh my god

2175.2 --> 2182.8089999999997
not really so long I've never actually

2179.91 --> 2182.8089999999997
got to go I would

2183.36 --> 2191.1800000000003
- thank you probably Big Easy what is it

2187.71 --> 2204.63
okay well I'll see you on the debates

2191.18 --> 2207.56
yeah okay well apparently the drivers

2204.63 --> 2209.94
protection is becoming too protective

2207.56 --> 2211.49
doesn't allow the driver to function

2209.94 --> 2214.38
anymore

2211.49 --> 2218.27
it's weird I have no idea why you

2214.38 --> 2218.27
brought that up but oh well

2232.67 --> 2241.96
okay flat on flat earth asks a very

2237.339 --> 2241.96
difficult question why is the sky blue

2245.53 --> 2250.42
I don't know exactly I think it has to

2247.78 --> 2252.55
do with what is in it as light passes

2250.42 --> 2258.9700000000003
through it is kind of like the ocean

2252.55 --> 2262.51
why are owns on the surface kind of

2258.97 --> 2268.23
bluish but it should go deeper and

2262.51 --> 2272.4300000000003
deeper it becomes kind of green well

2268.23 --> 2275.23
it's just because of the properties of

2272.43 --> 2277.6299999999997
the material through which the light

2275.23 --> 2280.78
passes so that that's the only thing

2277.63 --> 2284.11
that I can think of that isn't some kind

2280.78 --> 2287.7900000000004
of new scientific explanation I don't

2284.11 --> 2289.8700000000003
know why it is why it is blue naturally

2287.79 --> 2292.57
probably has to do something with the

2289.87 --> 2295.17
gases up there through which the light

2292.57 --> 2295.17
passes

2307.15 --> 2317.23
it's a material right well the light is

2312.88 --> 2318.85
not a material but you had the gas that

2317.23 --> 2323.13
is up there through which the light is

2318.85 --> 2323.13
passing yeah is a material of course

2336.82 --> 2341.94
right

2338.53 --> 2341.94
well thanks for the good questions

2348.17 --> 2353.21
yeah one thing about blue is that the

2350.6 --> 2357.47
blue color is very much on the higher

2353.21 --> 2363.7
spectrum what I can remember you have

2357.47 --> 2369.16
infrared red yellow green light blue

2363.7 --> 2371.6899999999996
thick blue purple and then ultraviolet

2369.16 --> 2374.2599999999998
also happens to be the spectrum of

2371.69 --> 2374.26
chakras

2377.09 --> 2384.4300000000003
yeah through Eastern philosophy

2381.34 --> 2388.75
spectrolite so yeah blue is pretty high

2384.43 --> 2394.0499999999997
on the spectrum it is actually

2388.75 --> 2394.05
associated with the vision in sight

2396.6 --> 2400.77
it's not really important but yeah blue

2398.25 --> 2405.51
is on the higher spectrum I don't know

2400.77 --> 2408.81
why why it is specifically blue why

2405.51 --> 2411.3
wouldn't be another color but yeah I'm

2408.81 --> 2415.86
pretty sure that it is has a color

2411.3 --> 2419.9900000000002
because it is light hitting material and

2415.86 --> 2423.0
then catching our eyes

2419.99 --> 2425.1299999999997
that's how color works it's light

2423.0 --> 2427.5
reflecting of something and whatever is

2425.13 --> 2430.35
absorbed is not going to be seen and

2427.5 --> 2432.54
whatever is reflected that's yeah the

2430.35 --> 2435.87
spectrums that are reflected is what we

2432.54 --> 2440.09
see in it is represented in color unless

2435.87 --> 2440.0899999999997
it is outside of the visual spectrum

2445.69 --> 2449.4700000000003
just light spectrum

2456.74 --> 2461.89
what's

2459.14 --> 2461.89
No

2462.94 --> 2473.02
the Sun or the if you mean the apparent

2470.38 --> 2475.21
Sun disk I don't know I don't know what

2473.02 --> 2478.78
color it is it's kind of too bright to

2475.21 --> 2481.299
make it out and yeah if you're gonna use

2478.78 --> 2482.9500000000003
filters then yeah you don't you don't

2481.299 --> 2486.819
get the full picture and the light is

2482.95 --> 2489.8489999999997
just too bright anyway I don't know the

2486.819 --> 2492.94
moon's not have that kind of color

2489.849 --> 2496.15
though it's pretty white sometimes you

2492.94 --> 2499.18
either wish now mostly just white and

2496.15 --> 2500.7400000000002
when it goes down and you have the

2499.18 --> 2503.8799999999997
entire atmosphere in between then it

2500.74 --> 2503.8799999999997
becomes yellow and red

2508.869 --> 2514.029
and I don't think that when the moon

2511.39 --> 2516.46
rises in the daytime which it sometimes

2514.029 --> 2519.969
still does like right after the Sun has

2516.46 --> 2521.619
left and yeah by the way it is even

2519.969 --> 2526.42
visible during the daytime what am I

2521.619 --> 2529.2690000000002
saying that the daylight the I mean the

2526.42 --> 2534.819
daylight or the blue sky has no

2529.269 --> 2539.16
influence on its color that's also some

2534.819 --> 2539.16
something that it might be no noteworthy

2540.21 --> 2549.039
Sun is also influenced by the atmosphere

2545.109 --> 2552.94
by becoming yellow red yellow orange and

2549.039 --> 2554.9500000000003
red so that's clear that that's part of

2552.94 --> 2558.309
the spectrum the down part very typical

2554.95 --> 2562.6899999999996
down part red is that the horizon is

2558.309 --> 2565.8390000000004
down yet the color sky is blue is up

2562.69 --> 2568.14
there kind of funny when you think about

2565.839 --> 2568.14
it

2582.99 --> 2592.18
right of course

2586.93 --> 2595.99
I hope from their clock oh he knows the

2592.18 --> 2601.75
distance he knows the distance of the

2595.99 --> 2607.8689999999997
Sun good so how did you come to that

2601.75 --> 2613.17
knowledge did you measure it did you

2607.869 --> 2613.17
deduce it did you calculate it

2622.8 --> 2627.5600000000004
right so why do you claim

2631.54 --> 2639.61
yeah those what you said right there son

2635.41 --> 2646.39
is about fifty nine hundred K above

2639.61 --> 2648.2200000000003
atmosphere and 6500 K on earth on a

2646.39 --> 2656.65
clear day like those sound like

2648.22 --> 2660.6
distances Kelvin why did he but

2656.65 --> 2660.6
okay No

2661.51 --> 2665.6090000000004
now you know you're confusing me now

2666.41 --> 2672.42
okay really is that calvini attempt I'm

2671.4 --> 2674.5190000000002
not good I know

2672.42 --> 2679.16
so roughly how Kelvin works but I've

2674.519 --> 2679.16
never actually learned to work with that

2682.11 --> 2685.8900000000003
I'm good at everything

2692.32 --> 2697.4590000000003
[Applause]

2708.46 --> 2716.04
so what you're stating is that the Sun

2711.73 --> 2716.04
has a specific temperature

2719.76 --> 2729.1800000000003
how do you know how did you measure that

2725.07 --> 2730.71
temperature specifically because as far

2729.18 --> 2735.9199999999996
as I know the only way to actually

2730.71 --> 2739.56
measure the temperature is by collecting

2735.92 --> 2743.55
sunlight and then measuring how much

2739.56 --> 2744.81
temperature it offsets I don't think

2743.55 --> 2750.48
you're actually measuring the

2744.81 --> 2755.0099999999998
temperature of the Sun because yeah it's

2750.48 --> 2757.7400000000002
not local enough there's yeah it's

2755.01 --> 2760.67
either very far away I don't think it

2757.74 --> 2763.74
has any distance it's just an apparition

2760.67 --> 2767.76
or it's far outside of our atmosphere

2763.74 --> 2770.8199999999997
like how are you measuring like a local

2767.76 --> 2772.4700000000003
temperature relating to that location of

2770.82 --> 2776.28
the Sun how do you do that I don't think

2772.47 --> 2778.859
you can so yeah that's why I kept on

2776.28 --> 2782.6090000000004
hammering yesterday the only thing you

2778.859 --> 2785.5499999999997
have is the temperature of daylight

2782.609 --> 2787.77
that's what you got because that

2785.55 --> 2789.78
apparition you see every time at the

2787.77 --> 2792.03
epicenter of where daylight comes from

2789.78 --> 2794.4500000000003
you have no proof that's actually an

2792.03 --> 2794.4500000000003
object

2815.13 --> 2821.4300000000003
oh wait you're talking about just the

2818.16 --> 2827.489
color temperature color I don't even

2821.43 --> 2829.64
know how that works okay so there's a

2827.489 --> 2833.099
way to measure the color spectrum

2829.64 --> 2839.16
through temperature that's weird

2833.099 --> 2841.6800000000003
that sounds very very calculus but yeah

2839.16 --> 2844.339
it might be a very good way to map index

2841.68 --> 2844.339
it I don't know

2857.22 --> 2863.8489999999997
okay okay fine you were talking purely

2859.77 --> 2866.49
about color so racist of us not just

2863.849 --> 2867.96
kidding but yeah I just wanted to

2866.49 --> 2874.2299999999996
mention again that I did have that

2867.96 --> 2878.819
discussion people always assuming it has

2874.23 --> 2883.099
to be there we see it so it has to be a

2878.819 --> 2889.339
thing has to be in a specific place

2883.099 --> 2893.569
physicality assumption bias it's very

2889.339 --> 2893.569
it's very tough to get over

2912.34 --> 2921.21
which Bella Anders ace is cloud

2915.43 --> 2921.21
flatlander Devin good loose lips

2922.34 --> 2936.9900000000002
libras 61 star a 61 star okay my view

2930.68 --> 2943.43
1875 I already said a lot to the rest of

2936.99 --> 2943.43
you I think well in five miss anyone

2944.47 --> 2947.16
all right

2947.609 --> 2958.17
ah thanks for a neat yeah well yeah

2956.369 --> 2963.869
that's what you get when you grow up in

2958.17 --> 2970.0190000000002
between computer and electronics people

2963.869 --> 2974.069
and people that like physics yeah like

2970.019 --> 2975.5989999999997
discussions like debating like getting

2974.069 --> 2977.67
in arguments with each other over

2975.599 --> 2980.039
technicalities so yeah I've been

2977.67 --> 2984.869
immersed in that heavily all my life

2980.039 --> 2988.219
pretty much since the start yeah and

2984.869 --> 2988.219
this is green tea that's right

3004.48 --> 3011.4900000000002
Oh Oh Karen B says there's a time change

3015.27 --> 3022.32
yeah I hear that that's done separately

3018.45 --> 3024.18
in the United States and Europe it's

3022.32 --> 3028.73
really weird how that works that they

3024.18 --> 3035.0099999999998
take a different time to shift the

3028.73 --> 3037.05
summer winter setting so I find it very

3035.01 --> 3039.4100000000003
odd that it's not all perfectly

3037.05 --> 3039.4100000000003
synchronized

3059.58 --> 3068.59
huh okay right

3064.96 --> 3071.76
hm yeah it's good to hear it's still in

3068.59 --> 3071.76
the attention but

3072.61 --> 3082.4500000000003
people have been talking about RFID

3075.7 --> 3084.7
chips for a very long time and even in

3082.45 --> 3086.5
yeah those conferences concerning

3084.7 --> 3088.87
chemtrails and vaccines it's like the

3086.5 --> 3093.75
flu vaccine back then was a very big

3088.87 --> 3093.75
issue but

3099.18 --> 3107.1099999999997
yeah RFID it it's always been highly

3103.15 --> 3108.9100000000003
alerting to a great number of people and

3107.11 --> 3114.4500000000003
that was back then as well I I don't

3108.91 --> 3114.45
think like this whole forced RF ID

3117.68 --> 3123.23
I don't think that's gonna happen like

3119.509 --> 3124.94
that look

3123.23 --> 3129.02
the worst that could happen is that

3124.94 --> 3133.69
suddenly everything's going to be forced

3129.02 --> 3133.69
forcibly applied and then it's just over

3133.809 --> 3140.3590000000004
if yeah as soon as you don't resist

3137.42 --> 3142.91
basically but yeah I don't think that's

3140.359 --> 3148.3089999999997
very likely to happen like that it's

3142.91 --> 3150.94
like too unstable people will damn well

3148.309 --> 3150.94
resist

3202.28 --> 3208.0400000000004
now Hagrid wells I just disagree I don't

3206.21 --> 3210.25
think you understand in how it's gonna

3208.04 --> 3214.61
be do how they do it

3210.25 --> 3217.88
you can't force that [ __ ] they're just

3214.61 --> 3223.4500000000003
gonna try to make it very attractive to

3217.88 --> 3223.4500000000003
do that that is all

3243.82 --> 3250.7400000000002
right and yeah it's called it would

3246.16 --> 3250.74
cause a split up the cultural split up

3251.64 --> 3260.79
and yeah that's gonna happen and just

3254.47 --> 3260.79
got to be prepared for everything

3261.5 --> 3269.18
like again are you gonna be part of the

3265.52 --> 3272.39
storm are you looking to lose yourself

3269.18 --> 3276.6189999999997
in the storm of developments or are you

3272.39 --> 3283.18
gonna be sitting tight and remain true

3276.619 --> 3283.1800000000003
to yourself that's what it's all about

3311.89 --> 3319.239
right yeah you know what guys I'm gonna

3314.92 --> 3321.849
round out the show because I don't see a

3319.239 --> 3324.239
lot of developments here things I can

3321.849 --> 3324.239
talk about

3358.339 --> 3364.8089999999997
okay fine each says culture needs nature

3361.459 --> 3367.729
and nature doesn't meet cultivation I

3364.809 --> 3373.699
don't know for sure about that

3367.729 --> 3374.499
a culture definitely needs nature that's

3373.699 --> 3379.309
for sure

3374.499 --> 3384.229
but yeah I don't know

3379.309 --> 3390.4100000000003
cultivation like cultivation should not

3384.229 --> 3395.66
replace nature but to do it may yeah

3390.41 --> 3399.89
bring us closer in other ways but it

3395.66 --> 3404.719
should never replace it and just until

3399.89 --> 3408.729
there is no more nature that could be

3404.719 --> 3408.7290000000003
very dangerous I think

3417.65 --> 3426.2490000000003
yeah and by the way cultivation can also

3420.289 --> 3430.4
be considered taking care of wild places

3426.249 --> 3434.39
so caring for a big forest or something

3430.4 --> 3440.509
that's also in a way form of cultivation

3434.39 --> 3445.839
you care take it because truly true wild

3440.509 --> 3451.999
we're like no human ever it ever comes

3445.839 --> 3454.009
that's incredibly rare humans do get

3451.999 --> 3456.9199999999996
involve humans do want to keep certain

3454.009 --> 3462.289
things the way they are in nature

3456.92 --> 3463.609
beautiful things or whatever or yeah or

3462.289 --> 3468.4300000000003
they just want to get it out of the way

3463.609 --> 3468.43
to dig up their their goodies

3478.21 --> 3483.71
right

3480.23 --> 3485.839
that's right we do still need wood and I

3483.71 --> 3489.349
think that there are like dedicated

3485.839 --> 3491.57
forests for cultivation like that are

3489.349 --> 3492.94
read for the wood industry and I think

3491.57 --> 3498.8900000000003
that is good

3492.94 --> 3501.7400000000002
we do need wood just don't touch the old

3498.89 --> 3503.5099999999998
forest leave give them a break if those

3501.74 --> 3506.2
trees and break give them a chance to

3503.51 --> 3506.2000000000003
become huge

3528.82 --> 3533.2400000000002
anyway yeah guys I am gonna round out

3531.5 --> 3537.83
the show so thanks everyone for coming

3533.24 --> 3540.6499999999996

3549.94 --> 3558.17
although yeah I do appreciate getting up

3554.63 --> 3562.4300000000003
votes because then I at least feel that

3558.17 --> 3565.3
I that I have performed adequately yeah

time and yeah sometimes I go on a little

3598.849 --> 3603.56
bit earlier like a Monday and then yeah

3601.16 --> 3606.56
if you hit development notification then

3603.56 --> 3608.0299999999997
you can see that I came on earlier and

3606.56 --> 3610.609
you're not coming in halfway or

3608.03 --> 3613.849
something so yeah that's up to you but I
