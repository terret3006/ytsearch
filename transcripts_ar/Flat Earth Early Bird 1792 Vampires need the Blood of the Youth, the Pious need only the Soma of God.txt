funny YouTube keeps freezing my

181.2 --> 187.83999999999997
video again it's one of those

185.319 --> 191.07999999999998
days

187.84 --> 193.72
whatever all right how are you doing I'm

191.08 --> 193.72
doing pretty

200.84 --> 206.92000000000002
good it is cold though here

203.76 --> 211.519
and yeah getting out of bed is not like

206.92 --> 212.79899999999998
the most enjoyable thing

211.519 --> 215.28
when it's this

212.799 --> 218.15900000000002
cold and I do actually sleep with the

215.28 --> 218.159
window open

220.36 --> 224.92000000000002
so right but I'm used to

232.879 --> 236.51899999999998
that day

237.959 --> 245.28
okay Thunder storm cloudy Misty

241.56 --> 245.28
what what are you talking

251.64 --> 260.079
about like storm and Mist don't

257.079 --> 260.079
mix

263.4 --> 269.12
anyway yeah it might like one day storm

267.0 --> 271.6
and the other day miss that that may

269.12 --> 271.6
happen sure

273.6 --> 278.08000000000004
sure all right anyway I hope you're

275.68 --> 278.08
doing

278.32 --> 281.399
[Music]

289.4 --> 293.35999999999996
okay

291.039 --> 296.36
oh okay

293.36 --> 296.36
ter

297.32 --> 302.8
right I yeah that's sounds like

300.08 --> 302.8
astrology

320.039 --> 325.08
stuff I don't really know about

328.479 --> 331.479
that

348.96 --> 355.88
H okay well ter

352.12 --> 358.4
look if you're if you seem to be pretty

355.88 --> 361.4
deep into astrology if you like keep

358.4 --> 365.23999999999995
making predictions and it just comes

361.4 --> 365.23999999999995
true I'll start to pay

366.599 --> 371.88
attention but you're like G with very

369.599 --> 375.24
detailed things and I don't have an

371.88 --> 375.24
oversight over that sort of

375.52 --> 381.96
thing right so but you're saying bright

378.0 --> 381.96
Sunshine tomorrow okay we'll

387.16 --> 393.56
see better than those weathered

390.88 --> 398.96
predictions from the weather Department

393.56 --> 398.96
yeah I guess I don't know it's

402.56 --> 409.68
different although I wonder you know

405.479 --> 412.479
if if they like let

409.68 --> 415.24
AI do the modeling with weather

412.479 --> 418.75899999999996
predictions and all that it might

415.24 --> 421.599
like it's going to try to make it work

418.759 --> 423.879
so if astrology really is the thing

421.599 --> 426.84
that's like super helpful in predicting

423.879 --> 429.16
the weather then it's going to utilize

426.84 --> 431.35999999999996
that might not even say that it is it

429.16 --> 433.52000000000004
just will use

431.36 --> 436.47900000000004
it right

433.52 --> 441.19899999999996
because a real AI is just going to use

436.479 --> 444.52
what works like whether people believe

441.199 --> 444.52000000000004
in it or agree to it or

444.919 --> 451.24
not unless it's specifically programmed

447.84 --> 453.84
not to do it anyway hello Expedition

451.24 --> 455.44
truth good to see

453.84 --> 459.56
you

455.44 --> 463.319
right by the way it is Thursday the 30th

459.56 --> 463.319
of November 20

468.24 --> 476.24
2023 all right what is the

472.479 --> 476.24
temperature 3°

478.319 --> 485.879
C

480.08 --> 489.96
uh H it's moving the weather

485.879 --> 493.0
though it was going to be snowy

489.96 --> 496.75899999999996
remember at the end of the

493.0 --> 498.52
week and now it's Monday it's like oh

496.759 --> 501.96000000000004
the snow's Mon it's going to start

498.52 --> 505.28
Monday yeah see so I knew it they're

501.96 --> 507.23999999999995
just trying to dangle it in your face to

505.28 --> 509.87899999999996
make you

507.24 --> 513.32
anticipate there like weird man ulation

509.879 --> 516.279
going on with like General weather

513.32 --> 520.5600000000001
predictions I think it's been

516.279 --> 520.56
like entangled by social

522.959 --> 529.4399999999999
engineering I mean I've been like every

525.959 --> 533.7199999999999
day looking at it with predictions to

529.44 --> 536.6800000000001
the Future for years now and I'm just

533.72 --> 538.76
really starting to notice these

536.68 --> 540.8389999999999
patterns right and if they're going to

538.76 --> 543.48
put some something in the future for you

540.839 --> 545.9200000000001
and then keep shoving it further like oh

543.48 --> 547.36
it's really going to come well what is

545.92 --> 548.92
that going to do everybody that's going

547.36 --> 551.16
to watch that it's going to like oh it's

548.92 --> 555.3199999999999
going to be like that

551.16 --> 558.519
later so whatever they intended to

555.32 --> 562.1600000000001
achieve that effect is achieved and

558.519 --> 566.92
whatever correlates resonates with

562.16 --> 569.48
that like oh it's going to be cold

566.92 --> 570.92
soon but then it never comes you're

569.48 --> 573.5600000000001
always thinking it's going to be cold

570.92 --> 573.56
whatever that

574.72 --> 577.72
is

584.34 --> 587.389
[Music]

595.92 --> 601.4799999999999
anyway got an Illuminati cu on

602.76 --> 606.16
here still

607.32 --> 612.839
warm going to Chow Down on that

628.04 --> 631.04
soon

644.2 --> 647.639
right so yeah what are you all

649.68 --> 654.3599999999999
doing what H yeah how was your day what

652.839 --> 658.0400000000001
have you been doing what have you been

654.36 --> 661.04
up to anything happening out

658.04 --> 661.04
there

666.88 --> 670.279
oh holy

671.0 --> 675.519
[ __ ] Henry Kissinger just

683.2 --> 687.399
died a great

685.8 --> 691.56
opportunity

687.399 --> 694.04
crisis this I never forget that he said

691.56 --> 694.04
that

695.839 --> 702.2
right well of all the globalist creepy

699.72 --> 706.5600000000001
people I think I probably had like the

702.2 --> 706.5600000000001
most respect for him if that means

709.079 --> 716.279
anything I mean I liked Henry Kissinger

712.56 --> 722.2399999999999
was like which pile of [ __ ] do you like

716.279 --> 726.0
best Henry Kissinger or Soros right yeah

722.24 --> 726.0
I like Henry kinger a lot more than

729.32 --> 734.8000000000001
Soros but uh yeah apparently he just

735.199 --> 739.8389999999999
died yeah ter you could say it like

742.24 --> 748.16
that you're sitting shiva all day

745.76 --> 750.88
because that's hilarious lowo thanks for

748.16 --> 750.88
that

758.32 --> 764.1600000000001
wow Henry I hope it was worth

761.44 --> 765.1990000000001
it don't think it really turned out how

764.16 --> 768.399
we thought it

765.199 --> 771.279
would Henry Kissinger has made some

768.399 --> 774.12
objections on the stage

771.279 --> 777.12
okay he had been like uh

774.12 --> 779.24
multiculturalism is not really turning

777.12 --> 782.92
out to be that good an idea he like said

779.24 --> 785.48
that recently so yeah that oh that makes

782.92 --> 788.079
everything all right no I get I know

785.48 --> 788.0790000000001
it's just

792.76 --> 799.959
that I guess all the the the the most

797.16 --> 802.68
evil disgusting ones always last to the

799.959 --> 802.68
very bitter

807.76 --> 814.56
end has gone to that place down there

811.639 --> 817.32
maybe I don't know how that

814.56 --> 819.6389999999999
works I don't know what deal he's made

817.32 --> 819.639
with

825.32 --> 830.88
God but he's certainly going to be

828.399 --> 833.88
facing the

830.88 --> 833.88
damage

837.44 --> 840.759
absolutely right

841.959 --> 848.5189999999999
he's going to like in death he's going

844.16 --> 851.0
to feel the damage he's actually

848.519 --> 855.6
caused and he will not be

851.0 --> 855.6
protected well it happens that for

859.88 --> 866.36
sure it's a done deal decades ago okay

863.12 --> 870.68
sure well that's between him and

866.36 --> 870.6800000000001
God and Satan or whatever

878.079 --> 884.04
DED I mean I don't actually believe in

881.199 --> 884.04
hell like

891.8 --> 896.519
that but I mean if you're going to

894.24 --> 899.24
presuppose like a

896.519 --> 900.8
really yeah

899.24 --> 904.0790000000001
a more

900.8 --> 907.92
oldfashioned Christian type cosmology

904.079 --> 910.8
view then yeah well yeah then he would

907.92 --> 910.8
certainly go

911.32 --> 917.759
there to the nightmare place but I mean

914.44 --> 921.6800000000001
I don't believe that place is

917.759 --> 925.72
real I think that's conjured up by

921.68 --> 925.7199999999999
men inspired by

926.0 --> 930.6
Satan because Satan is real

932.279 --> 937.0
yeah I'm not denying that like there is

935.24 --> 940.8
this

937.0 --> 940.8
seducing destructive

948.72 --> 955.48
force to be thrown to the

952.24 --> 955.48
realm yeah

957.6 --> 960.6
sure

961.56 --> 967.16
right so now you're getting to see

963.399 --> 967.16
another side of me perhaps

969.6 --> 977.279
teret I like to threaten

972.959 --> 977.279
things like attempt to

977.68 --> 984.4799999999999
like to make them

981.04 --> 985.959
stop like once they're like actually

984.48 --> 989.36
dead or

985.959 --> 992.04
something like I don't really feel like

989.36 --> 995.8000000000001
I'm not like yeah push that Spirit In

992.04 --> 998.16
Hell or something like I'm not eager for

995.8 --> 998.16
that at

999.68 --> 1006.399
all I I really just wanted them to all I

1003.399 --> 1008.88
want them all to convert to the to good

1006.399 --> 1012.279
during their life especially if it's

1008.88 --> 1012.279
really impossible the more

1012.399 --> 1016.759
impossible the more impactful that will

1015.12 --> 1019.759
be on the

1016.759 --> 1022.519
world right

1019.759 --> 1024.679
that might potentially not even recog I

1022.519 --> 1027.76
don't know man it's just

1024.679 --> 1031.6000000000001
that maybe you expected me to go all off

1027.76 --> 1033.679
on him and start explaining how he's

1031.6 --> 1036.3999999999999
roasting in Hell or something but I I

1033.679 --> 1038.799
don't do that man have I ever really

1036.4 --> 1038.799
done

1039.52 --> 1047.0
that maybe with some really nasty

1044.36 --> 1048.9599999999998
figures in the past yeah but I guess

1047.0 --> 1050.799
that Henry kissy probably was really

1048.96 --> 1053.799
nasty I don't know though I don't know

1050.799 --> 1058.9189999999999
how nasty that guy

1053.799 --> 1058.9189999999999
was right no point in just

1064.88 --> 1071.44
assuming according to the batan okay

1075.28 --> 1080.3999999999999
sure I was said that the queen Knight

1077.88 --> 1080.4
yeah I bit

1080.48 --> 1086.2
look at it this way has it become any

1082.72 --> 1086.2
better teret

1102.88 --> 1109.3200000000002
right I mean doesn't this new king of

1107.919 --> 1113.2
England

1109.32 --> 1116.36
really make you like oh my God that

1113.2 --> 1121.0
Queen was So Graceful yeah we were like

1116.36 --> 1123.559
a you dirty Dragon it's so hard but yeah

1121.0 --> 1126.44
now look at it back honestly and compare

1123.559 --> 1129.44
it with this guy

1126.44 --> 1129.44
yeah

1130.08 --> 1135.039
right maybe you were just piling on

1133.08 --> 1137.24
because you were seeing it as the enemy

1135.039 --> 1139.84
but I mean just compare what you got now

1137.24 --> 1142.559
that's how I think it's it's like oh my

1139.84 --> 1146.559
God that's terrible but just look at how

1142.559 --> 1148.799
much worse it could get like be happy

1146.559 --> 1150.48
with the Harlot you have because you

1148.799 --> 1153.48
might get a worse

1150.48 --> 1156.24
Harlot instead that that's how I see

1153.48 --> 1158.3600000000001
things because there it's full of these

1156.24 --> 1164.28
[ __ ]

1158.36 --> 1166.6399999999999
creeps you know up there up up there

1164.28 --> 1166.6399999999999
with their

1167.24 --> 1174.0
money

1170.039 --> 1177.44
I just want the worst ones to fall over

1174.0 --> 1179.84
first right I mean theoretically in my

1177.44 --> 1182.0800000000002
mind at least it seems logical that if

1179.84 --> 1185.3999999999999
like the worst ones just all

1182.08 --> 1188.76
like they just get a spaz

1185.4 --> 1190.52
attack aneurysms or whatever they die

1188.76 --> 1194.64
and then like the less worse will be

1190.52 --> 1197.08
like oh might have like a like a balloon

1194.64 --> 1201.5590000000002
effect where suddenly they just the

1197.08 --> 1203.6789999999999
weight is lightened on on them and then

1201.559 --> 1205.6399999999999
they might suddenly be capable of like

1203.679 --> 1209.1200000000001
trying to figure out how to actually

1205.64 --> 1213.0800000000002
burrow themselves out of that

1209.12 --> 1215.559
Darkness sort of unexpectedly but I mean

1213.08 --> 1219.32
come a romantic or

1215.559 --> 1222.84
whatever I always dream of like dark

1219.32 --> 1225.039
creatures just suddenly choosing good

1222.84 --> 1227.1589999999999
and then becoming totally better I just

1225.039 --> 1228.96
fantasize about that sort of

1227.159 --> 1231.5590000000002
thing

1228.96 --> 1231.559
worked on

1236.52 --> 1243.4
me no not lesser of two evils that's not

1239.76 --> 1243.4
what I'm saying teret come

1244.48 --> 1248.48
on is I'm just being

1256.64 --> 1262.679
pragmatic to holy text you reap what you

1259.24 --> 1265.24
s yes D and I agree with that one that's

1262.679 --> 1266.159
why I said like I definitely believe

1265.24 --> 1270.279
that

1266.159 --> 1273.44
in like the afterlife experience he's

1270.279 --> 1276.64
going to face he's going to face all the

1273.44 --> 1280.0800000000002
damage he's done and dude that guy's

1276.64 --> 1283.5590000000002
like I mean he might have like been

1280.08 --> 1287.08
partially responsible for like like

1283.559 --> 1288.84
genocides in like China [ __ ] that guy's

1287.08 --> 1292.32
potentially

1288.84 --> 1295.12
indirectly responsible for like millions

1292.32 --> 1298.24
and millions of deaths like he's going

1295.12 --> 1301.1589999999999
to have some terrifying experience on

1298.24 --> 1303.32
the other side I just don't think that's

1301.159 --> 1306.48
hell that you're going to face that

1303.32 --> 1309.6
forever and burn among a bunch of

1306.48 --> 1311.84
deranged insanity and torture or

1309.6 --> 1312.52
something I don't think that happens

1311.84 --> 1315.9189999999999
like

1312.52 --> 1318.039
that unless they choose it for

1315.919 --> 1321.0800000000002
themselves unless that's like their own

1318.039 --> 1322.0
punishment that they choose maybe that

1321.08 --> 1325.1589999999999
who

1322.0 --> 1326.88
knows you know maybe if some of these

1325.159 --> 1329.64
crazy old

1326.88 --> 1331.679
dragons they dig themselves so deep into

1329.64 --> 1333.5590000000002
the darkness that they literally like

1331.679 --> 1336.4
long for

1333.559 --> 1339.2
punishment so that those people when

1336.4 --> 1340.8400000000001
they die they might literally like well

1339.2 --> 1342.52
create like the predition effect I think

1340.84 --> 1344.799
the predition from the Mormons is

1342.52 --> 1347.32
actually much closer to practical

1344.799 --> 1348.6
reality because predition is their Only

1347.32 --> 1351.799
Hell

1348.6 --> 1354.4399999999998
but you can't be sent there you can only

1351.799 --> 1357.279
choose it you

1354.44 --> 1360.919
choose that

1357.279 --> 1363.76
hell and that's something that yeah that

1360.919 --> 1366.2
some of these old dragons might be just

1363.76 --> 1368.48
[ __ ] up enough to actually choose that

1366.2 --> 1371.52
because they've just let the Earthly

1368.48 --> 1373.679
corruption corrupted them so bad

1371.52 --> 1376.9189999999999
that that's the only thing they can

1373.679 --> 1376.919
choose anymore

1376.96 --> 1380.96
right that feels more

1393.32 --> 1399.2
realistic how I face his wrath

1396.44 --> 1404.64
perhaps maybe you just have a

1399.2 --> 1404.64
very maybe your God is just very

1406.88 --> 1409.88
vengeful

1410.52 --> 1416.08
I actually really do believe and that

1413.159 --> 1418.3200000000002
you could say that's my God that's like

1416.08 --> 1422.32
my filter to God

1418.32 --> 1426.559
that's my God's like very

1422.32 --> 1426.559
threatening but he's also very

1427.2 --> 1431.919
forgiving then like I have the proof of

1432.88 --> 1438.64
that God is not actually vengeful

1435.84 --> 1441.6789999999999
there's always like infinite Redemption

1438.64 --> 1444.1200000000001
possibilities he's just hoping you you

1441.679 --> 1444.1200000000001
take

1444.279 --> 1450.24
that right he's got to do what he's got

1446.679 --> 1453.64
to do that's how I think of

1450.24 --> 1455.88
it right and that and the Old Testament

1453.64 --> 1459.48
God at that I don't think that that

1455.88 --> 1459.48
really is like the

1460.559 --> 1464.52
Creator I think that might be like more

1463.279 --> 1468.6
like

1464.52 --> 1471.36
a an old Pantheon God that was like

1468.6 --> 1477.279
dwelling trying to like get

1471.36 --> 1477.279
his get his godhood back after death or

1477.88 --> 1484.6000000000001
something which I mean might not even

1481.279 --> 1487.2
have been like a the worst of

1484.6 --> 1491.48
them I'm not sure I'm kind of like

1487.2 --> 1491.48
improvising now don't mean to insult

1496.76 --> 1499.76
anybody

1503.96 --> 1509.64
but I mean I think that people's

1506.039 --> 1513.36
personal relationship with God the

1509.64 --> 1514.8400000000001
Creator not if they like use Idols which

1513.36 --> 1517.32
might be possible I mean it's your

1514.84 --> 1519.279
choice man you

1517.32 --> 1521.72
know

1519.279 --> 1524.2
but

1521.72 --> 1527.84
that God

1524.2 --> 1530.0800000000002
basically becomes in ways you start to

1527.84 --> 1532.9599999999998
see them

1530.08 --> 1535.52
because of the correlating frequency so

1532.96 --> 1538.24
if there's like ver specific types of

1535.52 --> 1542.039
Virtues in you as a

1538.24 --> 1546.44
person or or pitfalls right that shine

1542.039 --> 1550.52
out then the god that you get to

1546.44 --> 1553.44
know will like evenly match

1550.52 --> 1556.0
that that's a part of my

1553.44 --> 1558.64
belief and so you can imagine that some

1556.0 --> 1561.159
of these messed up grabler crazy old

1558.64 --> 1564.3600000000001
dragons like

1561.159 --> 1569.0800000000002
isinger they Pro their God was probably

1564.36 --> 1571.4399999999998
pretty messed up like pretty damn dark

1569.08 --> 1573.559
like Molech like their God might have

1571.44 --> 1577.44
been like actually

1573.559 --> 1582.279
Molech right that's like how God

1577.44 --> 1582.279
then composes himself towards

1586.6 --> 1589.6
them

1595.559 --> 1599.399
K is old yeah he is super

1604.44 --> 1612.039
old and I mean the age was like wearing

1607.279 --> 1612.039
on him you could like see how old he was

1615.679 --> 1620.76
getting mentally he stayed pretty damn

1618.399 --> 1624.279
sharp till the end

1620.76 --> 1624.279
though unlike

1633.32 --> 1638.6
Soros hey by the way hello seeking star

1635.88 --> 1638.6000000000001
water good to see

1640.08 --> 1646.279
you right so anyway for those that

1643.799 --> 1649.6
weren't updated yet George Soros just

1646.279 --> 1651.72
died what am I saying J not Jor Soros

1649.6 --> 1655.6399999999999
sorry about that Henry

1651.72 --> 1655.64
Kissinger at the age of

1656.0 --> 1660.64
100 it just came in I just noticed I

1658.919 --> 1664.72

happened so one of the big dragons Bites

1667.76 --> 1669.96
the

1674.6 --> 1680.24
Dust this one thing you can say if Geor

1678.6 --> 1682.519
keeps saying George Soros he's still

1680.24 --> 1684.799
there one thing you can say of Henry

1682.519 --> 1688.0
Kissinger and that is that he was

1684.799 --> 1693.679
definitely a man that knew how

1688.0 --> 1693.679
to exploit a crisis to its maximum

1695.76 --> 1702.2
potential anyway I'm going to eat

1698.64 --> 1709.44
Illuminati kasw yeah hey clutch yeah big

1702.2 --> 1709.44

1787.24 --> 1792.3990000000001

it also because like in a very personal

1849.36 --> 1853.9189999999999
visceral way I like get to show off how

1851.64 --> 1855.519
much better I'm doing compared to like

1853.919 --> 1858.159
10 years

1855.519 --> 1861.2
ago like when

1858.159 --> 1862.8400000000001
they first got married and we started

1861.2 --> 1865.3600000000001
having these Christmas dinner thingies

1862.84 --> 1869.279
just three of us and some other people

1865.36 --> 1872.6789999999999
even like I was like still very like had

1869.279 --> 1876.399
issues I even like got angry one

1872.679 --> 1881.2
time dude I have was so Chuck full of

1876.399 --> 1881.1999999999998
drama and anger like 10 years ago it's

1881.6 --> 1886.1589999999999
unbelievable after like the breakup and

1883.679 --> 1889.96
all that

1886.159 --> 1892.7990000000002
but like that's not happening anymore

1889.96 --> 1897.72
like the last three Christmases have

1892.799 --> 1899.6
been like great like really G great like

1897.72 --> 1903.6000000000001
thick strong

1899.6 --> 1906.32
energy like a real sense of Destiny and

1903.6 --> 1909.639
everything sense of Destiny and

1906.32 --> 1909.639
belonging and

1910.639 --> 1916.1589999999999
wonderment like with us all and like we

1913.48 --> 1918.48
do feel like yeah we are kind of a

1916.159 --> 1919.679
family even though it's not like a

1918.48 --> 1923.44
growing

1919.679 --> 1923.44
family at the moment at

1933.519 --> 1937.3990000000001
least in a way I wish I could like see

1936.519 --> 1940.6
them

1937.399 --> 1944.399
more but I think that I'd just be

1940.6 --> 1944.399
getting on their nerves

1946.08 --> 1953.0
more I mean I do like Yap a lot and I

1949.72 --> 1955.799
always like try with people I know well

1953.0 --> 1958.36
I always try to in like pull them into

1955.799 --> 1960.9189999999999
complicated subject it's like oh this

1958.36 --> 1963.1589999999999
this new thing and like you already know

1960.919 --> 1966.3600000000001
I'm really smart and complicated so I'll

1963.159 --> 1968.7600000000002
just I'll just throw it on you and it

1966.36 --> 1971.12
does kind of tire out some people I

1968.76 --> 1973.32
guess and my dad included like you just

1971.12 --> 1977.84
you can't just keep hearing complicated

1973.32 --> 1980.76
things like on a daily basis

1977.84 --> 1980.76
starts giving him

1988.039 --> 1993.76
headaches my this is kind of weird but

1990.799 --> 1996.399
my dad's never been like a real

1993.76 --> 1999.799
intellectual person like that he's like

1996.399 --> 2003.1589999999999
he is sharp he has like real Clarity he

1999.799 --> 2005.48

brother too in his own way like just

2007.679 --> 2013.76

trying to figure things out like finding

2013.76 --> 2019.48
little puzzles

2015.2 --> 2021.159
and and my dad just not so much he would

2019.48 --> 2024.0
always like get along with that

2021.159 --> 2026.0800000000002
perfectly it just he didn't have that

2024.0 --> 2030.24

month like every 28 days

2368.04 --> 2375.129
hey Tommy good to see

2369.45 --> 2375.129
[Music]

2384.11 --> 2388.199
[Music]

2395.4 --> 2398.4
you

2425.359 --> 2428.359
for

2446.599 --> 2450.96
yeah that the Illuminati song certainly

2448.8 --> 2453.48
hit the spot I'm almost sorry I don't

2450.96 --> 2453.48
have another

2453.55 --> 2458.319
[Music]

2455.319 --> 2458.319
one

2463.48 --> 2466.65
[Music]

2485.24 --> 2488.24
m

2507.74 --> 2510.9199999999996
[Music]

2515.24 --> 2518.24
don't

2520.85 --> 2528.0299999999997
[Music]

2545.16 --> 2548.16
for

2554.37 --> 2562.979
[Music]

2566.0 --> 2570.319
I'm just thinking a lot in my head sorry

2567.68 --> 2570.319
for the long

2573.04 --> 2577.64
silence just made me think about

2575.24 --> 2578.7999999999997
Christmas and now I'm starting to dream

2577.64 --> 2581.52
like

2578.8 --> 2582.559
that we are getting closer to Christmas

2581.52 --> 2586.599
time aren't

2582.559 --> 2586.599
we it's less than a month

2592.4 --> 2598.599
away I wonder if there's going to be any

2595.04 --> 2599.68
snow this year during Christmas I mean

2598.599 --> 2602.559
that would

2599.68 --> 2608.0789999999997
be unique as that hasn't like happened

2602.559 --> 2608.079
in 10 20 years or something

2608.599 --> 2611.319
over here at

2614.28 --> 2620.2400000000002
least as your hippie mom telling me to

2617.119 --> 2622.559
chew my food better I chewed my food

2620.24 --> 2625.9599999999996
good I'm just not going to like super

2622.559 --> 2625.96
detailed chew it here

2626.4 --> 2629.4
because

2632.359 --> 2640.0789999999997
yeah and besides I chew just fine but

2636.359 --> 2642.48
thank you for the concern though hippie

2640.079 --> 2645.319
mom I

2642.48 --> 2647.2
indeed my parents were very much about

2645.319 --> 2649.8
you have to chew your food properly

2647.2 --> 2651.2799999999997
because I would just engorge it as a

2649.8 --> 2654.599
little kid it's just

2651.28 --> 2657.8390000000004
like I just want to swallow it

2654.599 --> 2657.839
whole and

2663.359 --> 2668.24
more read my comment on December Moon

2666.359 --> 2671.5589999999997
love

2668.24 --> 2677.7999999999997
oh hello dupons by the

2671.559 --> 2684.28
way twice every Moon 24 25 years

2677.8 --> 2684.28
what you have December full of s weird

2685.72 --> 2692.1189999999997
nectar is that that Christmasy energy

2689.64 --> 2696.5589999999997
what I'm was referring to you call that

2692.119 --> 2698.88
s that's creepy s is the same term they

2696.559 --> 2698.88
use

2699.0 --> 2704.28
in in uh damn

2705.44 --> 2710.68
it the book Brave New

2722.96 --> 2728.8
World right but I mean yeah are you

2726.319 --> 2732.8
saying that's extra strong this

2728.8 --> 2732.8
year because I'm feeling

2737.81 --> 2746.0
[Music]

2743.92 --> 2748.04
something so I want to ask you a

2746.0 --> 2750.16
question about that energy ter is that

2748.04 --> 2754.88
energy like when it gets really strong

2750.16 --> 2757.64
does it like make evil people

2754.88 --> 2759.96
die

2757.64 --> 2762.359
like guess that energy being around very

2759.96 --> 2765.92
intolerable to evil people like the

2762.359 --> 2768.2799999999997
actual dark ones could be like I just

2765.92 --> 2772.28
wonder if there is like officially a

2768.28 --> 2772.28
direct link like through your

2784.8 --> 2791.599
teachings

2787.359 --> 2791.5989999999997
this happens every year

2792.76 --> 2795.76
H

2802.4 --> 2808.52
okay right so it is just the that

2805.68 --> 2810.72
seasonal effect

2808.52 --> 2813.7599999999998
then I thought there might have been a

2810.72 --> 2817.7999999999997
little bit more to it

2813.76 --> 2817.8
even Christ's month

2833.559 --> 2841.48
H it's weird too because that extra

2836.8 --> 2845.559
energy that December Christmas

2841.48 --> 2849.64
energy it has an influence but PE people

2845.559 --> 2849.6400000000003
like respond differently to

2852.92 --> 2859.64
it I actually used to

2858.04 --> 2862.68
like

2859.64 --> 2868.2
get down from it a

2862.68 --> 2868.2
bit not like really badly but

2870.28 --> 2875.3190000000004
like I don't know maybe because like it

2873.599 --> 2879.2000000000003
is type of energy that's typically

2875.319 --> 2881.24
associ iated when people get more cozy

2879.2 --> 2882.2
and More close with family and all that

2881.24 --> 2885.9199999999996
and more

2882.2 --> 2888.2799999999997
forgiving it kind of is but for me it

2885.92 --> 2889.599
kind of always emphasized like yeah I'm

2888.28 --> 2891.7200000000003
not

2889.599 --> 2895.2000000000003
socially like I'm kind of socially

2891.72 --> 2896.68
[ __ ] a bit so that always made me

2895.2 --> 2899.48
like down it's like everybody's

2896.68 --> 2901.52
connecting I'm not really that good at

2899.48 --> 2903.76
connecting but I mean that has kind of

2901.52 --> 2906.839
changed I mean I'm still kind of

2903.76 --> 2910.5200000000004
socially [ __ ] I guess

2906.839 --> 2913.119
but super welldeveloped around that so

2910.52 --> 2916.2
that people won't like you have to like

2913.119 --> 2919.079
really look to even

2916.2 --> 2922.72
notice like in social interactions with

2919.079 --> 2922.7200000000003
me in my private life and all

2926.319 --> 2931.96
that but I do actually feel like a lot

2929.16 --> 2933.92
of that darkness that I associated with

2931.96 --> 2937.92
December

2933.92 --> 2940.52
always maybe that's just like really

2937.92 --> 2942.44
stopped maybe it did have to do with

2940.52 --> 2944.599
like the demons that were haunting me as

2942.44 --> 2944.599
it

2945.92 --> 2951.599
were as they do with a lot of people you

2949.52 --> 2954.799
carry that with you all your life until

2951.599 --> 2958.559
you realize like what it is

2954.799 --> 2961.44
and like that it's not

2958.559 --> 2963.76
you that that's not actually you it's

2961.44 --> 2967.119
something else and you can get rid of

2963.76 --> 2969.6800000000003
that and I have

2967.119 --> 2969.6800000000003
like with the

2970.92 --> 2977.319
technique Rudolph Steiner

2973.88 --> 2977.319
based prayer

2977.799 --> 2981.119
technique very

2981.68 --> 2990.1189999999997
effective extremely effective if

2986.16 --> 2992.52
yeah really it's not like regular prayer

2990.119 --> 2996.1600000000003
like already has like a kind of

2992.52 --> 2999.52
energy right this stuff is it's just

2996.16 --> 2999.52
freaking magic it I

2999.92 --> 3005.92
mean it's the the the closest thing I've

3003.319 --> 3009.4
gotten to like almost Dungeons and

3005.92 --> 3012.64
Dragons level magic in my

3009.4 --> 3012.64
view with

3013.48 --> 3020.319
this the words taken very serious very

3017.4 --> 3021.359
focused I mean it it does actually feel

3020.319 --> 3026.52
like

3021.359 --> 3028.92
spellcasting very serious like under God

3026.52 --> 3032.48
it's not like witchy oh I'm going to do

3028.92 --> 3033.6800000000003
the dark thing no absolutely not but it

3032.48 --> 3036.68
is like

3033.68 --> 3036.68
magic

3037.96 --> 3045.559
just rearranging how the energies lie in

3042.04 --> 3048.72
my body with a few words calling on a

3045.559 --> 3051.6400000000003
few Angels or well a few Archangel

3048.72 --> 3054.4399999999996
Michael I mean it's it's the number

3051.64 --> 3058.0
one and it's

3054.44 --> 3061.0
like this is yeah this is not

3058.0 --> 3061.0
psychosomatic

3065.52 --> 3072.68
guys but focus is a big part of it like

3068.839 --> 3076.16
if I I have to get properly F I can't

3072.68 --> 3079.16
halfway do it you got to really focus do

3076.16 --> 3083.44
it otherwise just it breaks apart you

3079.16 --> 3083.44
lose your focus and get

3084.359 --> 3087.359
distracted

3091.119 --> 3099.44
escalate scenario to higher energy

3096.16 --> 3101.16
hm it's really strong into yes I know

3099.44 --> 3102.96
teret that's kind of why I was

3101.16 --> 3105.7599999999998
mentioning it it's like I feel this

3102.96 --> 3106.799
thing and there's a lot happening you

3105.76 --> 3108.599
know in the

3106.799 --> 3112.24
world

3108.599 --> 3115.0
2023 is like a very special year in

3112.24 --> 3118.7599999999998
ways I felt that for a long time like

3115.0 --> 3118.76
there's something big happening it's

3119.119 --> 3125.2000000000003
like World War II for real it right it

3123.68 --> 3128.44
is

3125.2 --> 3128.4399999999996
effectively has

3130.64 --> 3137.24
been but like with big

3134.359 --> 3140.48
changes 2020 was big too yeah but that

3137.24 --> 3142.72
was like it's just an attack it's an

3140.48 --> 3146.4
assault on Humanity itself it's

3142.72 --> 3150.1189999999997
different like that's the darkness

3146.4 --> 3152.92
clawing everything in this is the other

3150.119 --> 3152.92
this is the other

3154.359 --> 3158.68
side old chains

3160.119 --> 3166.599
breaking people starting to realize that

3162.92 --> 3169.04
the Awakening really is worldwide that

3166.599 --> 3172.88
you're not just the only one that knows

3169.04 --> 3176.119
how to figure like that there's like the

3172.88 --> 3178.92
millions now

3176.119 --> 3180.52
that supposed conspiracy theorist people

3178.92 --> 3182.599
that just actually know how things

3180.52 --> 3186.28
really happen and all that that are

3182.599 --> 3189.44
informed are like really rising to

3186.28 --> 3192.079
become government people even like to so

3189.44 --> 3193.68
that you can actually replace it right I

3192.079 --> 3197.1600000000003
mean if you have a corrupted government

3193.68 --> 3200.319
that's that's cool oh get rid of them

3197.16 --> 3202.48
oh but then you got rid of them but then

3200.319 --> 3205.4
you still got to replace it right if you

3202.48 --> 3207.599
replace it with people that are just the

3205.4 --> 3209.319
same like them even though they weren't

3207.599 --> 3210.96
conspiring they're going to end up

3209.319 --> 3212.799
conspiring because that's what they

3210.96 --> 3216.44
typically do so you got to have like a

3212.799 --> 3216.44
completely different type of

3216.52 --> 3222.88
person to replace it instead of putting

3219.96 --> 3224.799
just another typical career politician

3222.88 --> 3228.6400000000003
there

3224.799 --> 3230.599
right and that is happening in many

3228.64 --> 3233.4
different

3230.599 --> 3235.839
ways like including like what she Dr

3233.4 --> 3240.04
Shiva is doing

3235.839 --> 3240.04
but it's like happening with

3240.92 --> 3249.2400000000002
everything it's like the resistance is

3244.72 --> 3249.24
really making its move like

3252.52 --> 3255.68
universally and like there's a lot of

3254.68 --> 3260.1189999999997
coming

3255.68 --> 3261.96
out coming out of being censored and now

3260.119 --> 3264.079
yeah it's caused a lot of polarization

3261.96 --> 3265.839
but I mean I'm pretty astounded by the

3264.079 --> 3267.92
whole

3265.839 --> 3271.44
all these groups that are like speaking

3267.92 --> 3274.559
out against Israel really heavy

3271.44 --> 3277.52
now and I mean I'm neutral in that in

3274.559 --> 3280.2400000000002
the face of that I'm like it's not good

3277.52 --> 3283.799
it's not bad it's like it's not my none

3280.24 --> 3289.16
of my damn business is what it is

3283.799 --> 3292.04
but that they dare do it is like

3289.16 --> 3294.8799999999997
whoa things have changed in the

3292.04 --> 3296.5589999999997
world they get that people are going

3294.88 --> 3299.839
there

3296.559 --> 3302.1600000000003
now and I'm absolutely neutral towards

3299.839 --> 3304.68
it but it is very telling and

3302.16 --> 3307.359
interesting from a psychological

3304.68 --> 3310.52
perspective hey and guess what I'm

3307.359 --> 3310.52
Into You

3312.24 --> 3319.5589999999997
know even Trudeau blasted yes dude have

3315.96 --> 3323.2400000000002
you seen by the way how Trudeau looked

3319.559 --> 3325.559
recently he's not doing good I don't

3323.24 --> 3327.839
know what the hell he's happen to him

3325.559 --> 3330.2400000000002
what like maybe he's like taken some

3327.839 --> 3331.48
kind of shot or something but what the

3330.24 --> 3334.3999999999996
[ __ ]

3331.48 --> 3339.0
man he's not looking too

3334.4 --> 3341.799
good something happened recently I

3339.0 --> 3343.96
think or maybe he just got caught like

3341.799 --> 3347.16
without the makeup and everything but

3343.96 --> 3351.119
holy [ __ ] man he does not look that

3347.16 --> 3354.0
great he doesn't look that young anymore

3351.119 --> 3355.92
too always looked like this

3354.0 --> 3358.2
CL

3355.92 --> 3358.2000000000003
okay

3358.92 --> 3365.16
teret but yeah that's happening so it's

3362.28 --> 3369.6400000000003
like the whole game Israel played in its

3365.16 --> 3373.48
own way political game it's it's

3369.64 --> 3376.5989999999997
fractured so it's like that

3373.48 --> 3380.039
means that the real under under

3376.599 --> 3386.92
underneath grabler the real people in

3380.039 --> 3391.3190000000004
the shadows have to rearrange the game

3386.92 --> 3394.88
yeah that's the consequence of the big

3391.319 --> 3398.079
game not working anymore that means they

3394.88 --> 3400.799
have to concoct another game and that

3398.079 --> 3400.799
may take a

3401.599 --> 3409.0
while and in the meantime it's massive

3405.72 --> 3411.48
opportunity for great for creating

3409.0 --> 3415.44
fortresses of freedom and

3411.48 --> 3418.92
liberty culturally Grassroots to br race

3415.44 --> 3422.64
against the new attempts that will be

3418.92 --> 3425.4
coming to put us back in those voluntary

3422.64 --> 3429.52
change again because they will find a

3425.4 --> 3432.359
way to do it they will find a feasible

3429.52 --> 3436.44
way because that's like the reason they

3432.359 --> 3439.16
exists these people that's their life's

3436.44 --> 3439.16
Hellbound

3443.799 --> 3446.799
mission

3452.2 --> 3458.3999999999996
s is the philosophers

3454.88 --> 3461.88
that's teret I really like your comments

3458.4 --> 3461.88
sometimes man so

3462.039 --> 3469.92
insightful

3464.48 --> 3472.319
yeah like there is a form of immortality

3469.92 --> 3472.319
in

3472.52 --> 3479.68
Purity right the dark Elites they just

3475.92 --> 3483.0
like they suck the Earth dry from the

3479.68 --> 3487.0
living juices like vampires just to try

3483.0 --> 3489.2
to stay young but if you like live pure

3487.0 --> 3490.799
and good and like you really take it

3489.2 --> 3494.48
super

3490.799 --> 3498.799
serious and you really face and master

3494.48 --> 3503.0
your demons and all that then there's

3498.799 --> 3506.48
like the energy like what do you mean

3503.0 --> 3509.799
sucking dry the blood of children or

3506.48 --> 3513.72
something messed up of that like no it's

3509.799 --> 3516.44
just oh you did it right oh oh look

3513.72 --> 3518.68
there's just this fre free energy this

3516.44 --> 3522.359
just this energy it's every year and oh

3518.68 --> 3524.52
you get to absorb it because your

3522.359 --> 3526.92
frequency is not all messed up so it's

3524.52 --> 3532.16
like it's there and oh he it kind of

3526.92 --> 3534.48
revitalizes you yeah it's kind of magic

3532.16 --> 3537.3999999999996
yeah what do you mean you have to become

3534.48 --> 3538.96
a freaking vampire to become old and and

3537.4 --> 3541.96
stay

3538.96 --> 3541.96
young

3545.28 --> 3551.44
no you live right and you stay young you

3550.359 --> 3555.0389999999998
don't get

3551.44 --> 3555.039
full and you stay

3563.64 --> 3569.8799999999997
young just do the right things and don't

3567.72 --> 3571.0
do the wrong things and you stay young

3569.88 --> 3573.079
yeah

3571.0 --> 3578.72
sin is

3573.079 --> 3578.7200000000003
death sin is causes

3579.079 --> 3583.52
aging and when you think about that like

3581.599 --> 3586.28
that it's

3583.52 --> 3588.68
like these vampires and what they do

3586.28 --> 3590.3590000000004
it's like an ex like they're like

3588.68 --> 3593.64
bullets being

3590.359 --> 3595.2
fired down into hell

3593.64 --> 3597.48
metaphorically

3595.2 --> 3601.52
so fast because it's like they just

3597.48 --> 3604.0
commit even more sin to try to Stave off

3601.52 --> 3605.359
the effect that that sin will have of

3604.0 --> 3609.16
them they're

3605.359 --> 3611.68
like fractional Reserve banking with

3609.16 --> 3611.68
their own

3611.839 --> 3618.319
souls and their bubble the inflation

3615.92 --> 3620.92
bubble of their refraction of Reserve

3618.319 --> 3623.5589999999997
banking on their own souls are

3620.92 --> 3626.559
bursting yeah can you imagine

3623.559 --> 3626.559
that

3629.68 --> 3634.0
that's

3630.839 --> 3637.319
crazy and probably kind of what it's

3634.0 --> 3639.839
like for these

3637.319 --> 3642.079
vampires it's like they do something

3639.839 --> 3644.48
terrible which makes them age even

3642.079 --> 3647.52
faster so then they can't

3644.48 --> 3650.319
stop doing that terrible new thing to

3647.52 --> 3652.0
try to Stave off the Aging because

3650.319 --> 3653.88
they're aging even faster because

3652.0 --> 3655.319
they're doing that and then they're

3653.88 --> 3658.079
probably going to find find ways to do

3655.319 --> 3662.599
it even more and

3658.079 --> 3665.599
even yeah it's like it keeps

3662.599 --> 3670.119
accelerating down in

3665.599 --> 3671.7200000000003
hell cuz the wages for sin are death

3670.119 --> 3673.6800000000003
it's like

3671.72 --> 3678.1189999999997
literally

3673.68 --> 3678.1189999999997
literal not liberal but

3683.44 --> 3686.44
literal

3695.839 --> 3701.64
right and even like through rud

3699.079 --> 3705.079
Steiner's teachings my healer says like

3701.64 --> 3709.8799999999997
the spirit heals you way

3705.079 --> 3709.88
more than any physical

3713.44 --> 3718.2000000000003
nourishment like it's actually the

3716.119 --> 3722.2400000000002
spirit that keeps you

3718.2 --> 3726.4399999999996
young how could you argue this well

3722.24 --> 3730.0789999999997
because it allows your microcellular

3726.44 --> 3733.079
functions and everything to just absorb

3730.079 --> 3735.7200000000003
everything better and put it better to

3733.079 --> 3738.119
use that's because of the spirit that's

3735.72 --> 3740.72
because the spirit is maximized it's

3738.119 --> 3742.7200000000003
like you're 100% on Spirit you're like

3740.72 --> 3746.3999999999996
your spirit is 100% in your

3742.72 --> 3747.9199999999996
body that means that like everything

3746.4 --> 3751.279
works better it's

3747.92 --> 3754.839
clearer but not just like the mind it's

3751.279 --> 3757.079
also like on a cellular level everything

3754.839 --> 3757.0789999999997
is

3762.319 --> 3766.799
clear and when everything is clearer

3764.76 --> 3769.8390000000004
there is less aging everything is more

3766.799 --> 3773.359
efficient there's less

3769.839 --> 3776.359
waste on a micro level

3773.359 --> 3776.359
even

3781.839 --> 3790.799
and this is Al you can like even point

3786.119 --> 3793.599
at like people can be like doing fine

3790.799 --> 3795.599
being pretty healthy looking pretty good

3793.599 --> 3797.4
and then that like something happens and

3795.599 --> 3799.92
they snaps in their mind and they just

3797.4 --> 3802.44
lose it like it it doesn't happen a lot

3799.92 --> 3805.039
thank God sometimes it like happens to

3802.44 --> 3807.039
like people in their teens

3805.039 --> 3809.48
often if it

3807.039 --> 3810.7990000000004
happens where they just like it's one

3809.48 --> 3813.319
day they're like normal and the other

3810.799 --> 3815.92
day they're like it's like they lost it

3813.319 --> 3819.24
they lost something but because they

3815.92 --> 3823.319
lose it they lost that's like losing

3819.24 --> 3825.0389999999998
your spirit it's like it's gone and it's

3823.319 --> 3827.44
like you're not yourself anymore

3825.039 --> 3829.7200000000003
literally you're still there like a

3827.44 --> 3831.839
backup program trying to scramble but

3829.72 --> 3834.359
you're not you what you were that

3831.839 --> 3837.52
stability that that fullness is is

3834.359 --> 3839.799
suddenly gone you lost your spirit and

3837.52 --> 3841.7599999999998
then yeah nobody understands it and they

3839.799 --> 3845.96
might put you medication or

3841.76 --> 3849.0
whatever but then as time passes it will

3845.96 --> 3851.48
start to show where before it was like

3849.0 --> 3854.0
perfect Serenity and it's like clean and

3851.48 --> 3856.599
you like shine it's like wow radiant

3854.0 --> 3860.319
Youth and then suddenly you go nuts like

3856.599 --> 3861.599
that and you will like start to see it

3860.319 --> 3865.839
in your

3861.599 --> 3869.2400000000002
face like when my mother went really bad

3865.839 --> 3874.72
psychologically and on medication

3869.24 --> 3877.3999999999996
too like you could like see it on her

3874.72 --> 3879.319
face where before there was like this

3877.4 --> 3883.1600000000003
really refined

3879.319 --> 3885.5589999999997
sophistication like liberal but like

3883.16 --> 3888.24
good the good side of the good hippie

3885.559 --> 3891.799
dippy kind of side that's just kind of

3888.24 --> 3894.5589999999997
scared of rightwing stuff and all that

3891.799 --> 3897.92
and religion but like really good good

3894.559 --> 3899.48
intent with like very refined and but

3897.92 --> 3902.4
then it just

3899.48 --> 3905.039
like changed and it's like you can't

3902.4 --> 3910.0
recognize it anymore because they lost

3905.039 --> 3912.8390000000004
their mind and like and the physical

3910.0 --> 3915.64
follows like if the spirit's not there

3912.839 --> 3921.96
anymore the body

3915.64 --> 3921.96
dilapidator up or get to toxified

3922.48 --> 3926.52
polluted it's not

3924.599 --> 3929.2000000000003
efficient

3926.52 --> 3932.359
anymore it's because the spirit's not in

3929.2 --> 3934.2
the body right the spirit is not that's

3932.359 --> 3938.119
not like

3934.2 --> 3941.0389999999998
colloquial or movie idea

3938.119 --> 3943.76
spirit it's like a component it's a type

3941.039 --> 3948.5200000000004
of energy that's part of your

3943.76 --> 3951.039
being that influences your mind but also

3948.52 --> 3954.48
very much influences you on a cellular

3951.039 --> 3957.3190000000004
level it influences your your physical

3954.48 --> 3957.319
living being

3959.68 --> 3966.319
too so I guess it's like a different

3962.319 --> 3968.839
type of idea of spirit as is

3966.319 --> 3971.319
typically thought of in the western

3968.839 --> 3973.52
world like oh it's your your spirit is

3971.319 --> 3975.44
your Consciousness without the body or

3973.52 --> 3978.119
something like no no that's not the

3975.44 --> 3980.64
spirit I'm talking about that's the

3978.119 --> 3982.92
Consciousness you could say in spirit

3980.64 --> 3984.5589999999997
form or something if you're actually

3982.92 --> 3986.279
like out of body like

3984.559 --> 3989.3590000000004
floating around and watching or

3986.279 --> 3991.92
something right but that's very

3989.359 --> 3995.24
different of when I'm talking about your

3991.92 --> 3997.52
spirit of your being and influencing

3995.24 --> 3997.52
your

3997.559 --> 4004.3190000000004
body because in the rud Steiner

3999.76 --> 4009.3590000000004
tradition there's like three major

4004.319 --> 4012.48
components that is your spirit which

4009.359 --> 4015.72
governs your mind your

4012.48 --> 4018.279
vision but it also also governs like a

4015.72 --> 4022.279
lot of your health your cellular health

4018.279 --> 4026.64
and then there's the the soul

4022.279 --> 4026.64
soul governs the

4027.559 --> 4034.3190000000004
ego but it also like governs Destiny in

4031.119 --> 4037.2400000000002
a way because it well because of the ego

4034.319 --> 4041.7599999999998
it's like but that thing can

4037.24 --> 4044.5989999999997
be restored or it can be crippled if

4041.76 --> 4046.48
your if your soul

4044.599 --> 4048.599
so yeah and in that sense it's another

4046.48 --> 4050.16
form of Soul not very Christian yeah

4048.599 --> 4052.48
it's a mechanism it's the Rudolph

4050.16 --> 4057.5589999999997
Steiner tradition

4052.48 --> 4059.64
mechanism Spirit Soul ethereal Body

4057.559 --> 4062.92
Spirit mostly the

4059.64 --> 4065.48
mind right

4062.92 --> 4068.119
soul ego and like everything that

4065.48 --> 4070.48
surrounds that and just your a lot of

4068.119 --> 4072.96
your Social management

4070.48 --> 4074.16
skills right because you use your like

4072.96 --> 4076.88
everything that's related to and then

4074.16 --> 4080.7599999999998
the Ethereal body which is

4076.88 --> 4080.76
really that's really

4081.0 --> 4087.52
like non-conscious based cellular

4085.359 --> 4091.52
function it's like

4087.52 --> 4095.119
the the traffic of your body so it's

4091.52 --> 4096.92
like the spirit side definitely has a

4095.119 --> 4098.56
direct influence on that because if your

4096.92 --> 4100.319
spirit's not in your body then like your

4098.56 --> 4102.400000000001
organs aren't properly going to function

4100.319 --> 4104.64
they're going to be in standby but the

4102.4 --> 4107.879999999999
Ethereal body

4104.64 --> 4111.279
is another side of that that's like

4107.88 --> 4114.319
completely independent from the

4111.279 --> 4117.92
Consciousness this get complicated right

4114.319 --> 4120.52
but all these three elements are part of

4117.92 --> 4123.04
my

4120.52 --> 4126.359
technique I have to put all these three

4123.04 --> 4129.08
bodies back in all the yeah these energy

4126.359 --> 4133.2390000000005
bodies and restore them in myself and

4129.08 --> 4137.64
seal them and also just realize again

4133.239 --> 4139.08
like what are are they where are they at

4137.64 --> 4143.08
I

4139.08 --> 4145.88
ask and ask and thou shalt receive an

4143.08 --> 4150.04
answer like how are they like I

4145.88 --> 4153.319
literally almost like a like a watering

4150.04 --> 4155.719
Rod it's a purely ethereal process it's

4153.319 --> 4159.56
like I have to ask like what are the

4155.719 --> 4161.679
levels on these things like what's the

4159.56 --> 4163.759
percentage of my spirit what's the

4161.679 --> 4166.12
percentage of my soul what's the percent

4163.759 --> 4168.199
percentage of my ethereal body and I

4166.12 --> 4171.44
like half to Divine

4168.199 --> 4174.04
answers it's really difficult or it has

4171.44 --> 4176.159
been I'm getting much better at it cuz

4174.04 --> 4179.159
at the beginning like I wouldn't even

4176.159 --> 4182.48
understand the answer I'd be

4179.159 --> 4185.44
getting now my healer is a master at

4182.48 --> 4187.5199999999995
this he just you can ask it immediately

4185.44 --> 4189.5599999999995
gets the right

4187.52 --> 4192.719
answer well that's because he's been

4189.56 --> 4196.320000000001
training it for like 50 years or

4192.719 --> 4199.12
something I don't know very long time me

4196.32 --> 4201.239
I've been just training this for like

4199.12 --> 4205.5599999999995
two three

4201.239 --> 4209.28
years and it's getting really serious

4205.56 --> 4209.280000000001
now hey Bill

4225.08 --> 4231.0
do read my M ter I've been just talking

4228.56 --> 4235.64
inside looking inside my own mind for

4231.0 --> 4239.56
like 10 minutes so no I have not read

4235.64 --> 4239.56

[Music]

5011.88 --> 5017.6
though it it's like it's interesting

5033.52 --> 5039.92
if i' get into it it wouldn't work on me

5042.96 --> 5048.96
much it's always been

5045.52 --> 5052.080000000001

5223.4 --> 5231.599999999999
God uh well Mercury is like that's Roman

5228.96 --> 5235.719
Pantheon

5231.6 --> 5239.6
duper Mercury is the the Roman name that

5235.719 --> 5241.96
was eventually used for the planet

5239.6 --> 5243.400000000001
Mercury there's other names for him

5241.96 --> 5247.0
though

5243.4 --> 5249.638999999999
in Greek which is the more

5247.0 --> 5252.719
understood version It's

5249.639 --> 5253.719
Hermes it's the guy with the hat and the

5252.719 --> 5256.88
little

5253.719 --> 5260.2390000000005

master of trade and information he's

5260.239 --> 5266.638999999999

5299.84 --> 5305.159000000001
at the pantheon that he's just like

5302.6 --> 5309.4800000000005

5305.159 --> 5312.199
Zeus but dude he is like onethird of the

5309.48 --> 5316.159

I was a kid it's like like oh cool the

5321.36 --> 5325.36
Greek pantheon is like oh learning about
