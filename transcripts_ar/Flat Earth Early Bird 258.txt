blue and clear and it's a really hot

101.27 --> 111.859
summer day and lovely to be not in the

107.78 --> 115.88
city printing my friend Hagrid wells

111.859 --> 119.05999999999999
and yeah just having a great long talk

115.88 --> 126.009
and getting around smoking joy it was

119.06 --> 126.009
great mmm good seeing him again

126.969 --> 134.4
what does that okay

135.25 --> 140.88
I don't know why that wasn't necessary

142.62 --> 148.78
hm-hmm anyway

145.78 --> 151.06
it's hot I'm hot

148.78 --> 153.61
also I came here kind of in a hurry

151.06 --> 156.25
because yeah we were just busy talking

153.61 --> 158.56
and getting around until the last minute

156.25 --> 160.21
so I literally arrived five minutes

158.56 --> 162.1
before it didn't even have a time and to

160.21 --> 166.89000000000001
roll this extra Joanne didn't really

162.1 --> 169.87
need to hmm I might roll one somewhere

166.89 --> 171.86999999999998
if I feel like it anyway I got some

169.87 --> 177.0
blueberries how you just saw me take one

171.87 --> 183.45000000000002
love this love this stuff an apple

177.0 --> 183.45
Tamera coffee and water and that's it

190.04 --> 193.1
[Music]

194.34 --> 197.34
okay

198.33 --> 203.13000000000002
all right hm well I don't see that as a

201.12 --> 204.78
reason really to time him out that's

203.13 --> 211.07999999999998
just his thing calling everyone

204.78 --> 219.62
cretinous I don't know hello peanuts

211.08 --> 222.9
Clark it's okay a gem it's just that

219.62 --> 226.88
somebody calling somebody else an

222.9 --> 229.98000000000002
awkward thing it's not really necessary

226.88 --> 232.29
to time them out for that right until

229.98 --> 239.7
they're like really keeping on pushing

232.29 --> 244.23
it it's fine it's just that into musical

239.7 --> 250.64
is kind of like a regular visitor of my

244.23 --> 250.64
chats so I think

253.209 --> 266.22
don't worry about it it's all good

255.84 --> 266.22
and hot so yeah what has been going on I

267.12 --> 274.9
think I literally watched pretty much

271.36 --> 279.46000000000004
the entire evening have been watching

274.9 --> 281.90999999999997
Big Bang Theory and it was it was

279.46 --> 284.94899999999996
interesting there were just these

281.91 --> 288.66900000000004
moments when physics things were

284.949 --> 293.02000000000004
explained that were fascinating to hear

288.669 --> 294.94
from a is a self-proclaimed expert

293.02 --> 298.03
basically what they are is what they are

294.94 --> 299.979
and I don't know it's interesting

298.03 --> 302.79999999999995
because I don't think they're too far

299.979 --> 306.21999999999997
off it's just that they seem to then

302.8 --> 308.88
after stating things correctly ignore

306.22 --> 311.62
them in their proceedings of

308.88 --> 313.81
presuppositional fantastical speculation

311.62 --> 316.81
and then just take that for granted as

313.81 --> 321.49
absolute fact and that seems to be the

316.81 --> 324.06
pattern and they got it well they got it

321.49 --> 324.06
down really well

330.419 --> 341.49
young Sheldon hmm yeah I remember that

337.889 --> 344.31
one the the episode weather where they

341.49 --> 347.969
basically just met that was hilarious

344.31 --> 351.599
oh do I like Owen Benjamin well of

347.969 --> 354.539
course I do new W at least I like most

351.599 --> 358.639
of his work I pretty much follow him

354.539 --> 363.31899999999996
every single day and he has some really

358.639 --> 369.62
great trains of thought and ideas and

363.319 --> 373.71000000000004
he's pretty hardcore and I like that and

369.62 --> 376.379
sometimes it's like a little it's like

373.71 --> 379.169
yeah it's it's okay but not that's

376.379 --> 385.65000000000003
supremely funny maybe it's just me you

379.169 --> 390.029
know I guess what people think is fun

385.65 --> 393.419
taste is a matter of opinion but I yeah

390.029 --> 397.259
I bet I've laughed so hard during Owen

393.419 --> 400.31899999999996
Benjamin streams that just that I'd

397.259 --> 403.74
almost choked on my own saliva and all

400.319 --> 409.199
that stuff so yeah he just has amazing

403.74 --> 411.21000000000004
moments and he is absolutely a

409.199 --> 413.55
moon-landing skeptic and he's really

411.21 --> 420.839
figuring out how science is all screwed

413.55 --> 424.199
and I love it I love his his basic

420.839 --> 427.62
approach to this complex problem it's

424.199 --> 431.58000000000004
good because in it he's setting a good

427.62 --> 435.029
example for other people to resonate to

431.58 --> 437.18899999999996
that so in effect he's effectively

435.029 --> 441.389
helping other people to transcend the

437.189 --> 443.03900000000004
heart the swell red pill because he's

441.389 --> 446.43
doing it the way he does I'm getting

443.039 --> 448.11
that now he didn't just die straight in

446.43 --> 449.939
flat earth and went from that home

448.11 --> 453.12
because then you just have people

449.939 --> 456.99
immediately deflect off and he's doing

453.12 --> 458.909
it much better I don't know I really

456.99 --> 463.199
appreciate oh and Benjamin's work and he

458.909 --> 463.65
does point out some really dark things

463.199 --> 468.36
all

463.65 --> 470.58
so in a human way and also yeah I don't

468.36 --> 476.46000000000004
know it's just overall a good

470.58 --> 479.50899999999996
entertainer a good comedian and yeah I

476.46 --> 479.50899999999996
love his dreams

488.469 --> 495.689
he's God was going to have one foot in

490.919 --> 499.169
well look you have to recognize just

495.689 --> 503.619
with all the others with all of them

499.169 --> 505.929
anyone can corrupt anyone even Owen

503.619 --> 509.46900000000005
Benjamin even though he's putting all

505.929 --> 511.86899999999997
bets on that that's not gonna happen

509.469 --> 515.5889999999999
even it could happen you can't foresee

511.869 --> 517.3000000000001
it as an outsider what he's dealing with

515.589 --> 517.839
what he might be dealing with in the

517.3 --> 520.68
future

517.839 --> 524.62
but if he does that if he does just

520.68 --> 527.019
evade from that everyone will notice

524.62 --> 529.8100000000001
immediately and people will still hang

527.019 --> 538.18
on but it won't be the same if that

529.81 --> 542.579
would happen so I don't see any any

538.18 --> 542.579
deviation at the owned Benjamin really

549.4 --> 556.3299999999999
it just seems to be very risky with the

552.9 --> 562.2099999999999
with the kind of switcheroo of comedy

556.33 --> 563.83
and being literal but yeah that's part

562.21 --> 565.4200000000001
of the trick that's part of the trick

563.83 --> 575.23
he's doing because added he's also

565.42 --> 577.56
battling censorship anyway what's going

575.23 --> 577.5600000000001
on

592.34 --> 598.5300000000001
and anyway I'm gonna look into chat for

595.74 --> 602.97
a moment I should have done that ten

598.53 --> 612.8299999999999
minutes ago hello AGM Steve Amanda young

602.97 --> 617.07
stone monkey 3d / moco matrix media

612.83 --> 623.3100000000001
gotta kill the hope into musical the

617.07 --> 632.3900000000001
miss Kang in it's Clark that weakened in

623.31 --> 636.1099999999999
neo W pumpkin all right Jason McCormack

632.39 --> 636.11
yeah good to see you all

642.56 --> 649.6289999999999
what are you talking about AGM this

644.93 --> 649.6289999999999
sounds really stupid sorry

651.1 --> 658.899
just don't go with the numbers it's so

656.54 --> 658.899
stupid

674.31 --> 677.4699999999999
[Music]

700.36 --> 706.3290000000001
right it's not that difficult

703.17 --> 710.2199999999999
McCormick's why would anyone pronounce

706.329 --> 710.2199999999999
that mcCormick I don't get it

714.79 --> 727.0889999999999
sorry I'm the the heat it's the heat

717.73 --> 730.5690000000001
I'll just say it's the heat comments

727.089 --> 732.9390000000001
let's see yeah weird lift the veil I

730.569 --> 734.92
didn't see you through the problem is

732.939 --> 737.709
there's a lot of videos happening

734.92 --> 740.7389999999999
yesterday but I didn't really look

737.709 --> 743.92
through them all and normally an hour or

740.739 --> 745.72
two hours before the show starts I look

743.92 --> 751.389
over some videos to get into it but I

745.72 --> 753.429
never got to that so I don't really know

751.389 --> 756.399
oh yeah DePaul on the plane I saw a

753.429 --> 760.0889999999999
piece of it it looked kind of good a

756.399 --> 763.839
good presentation on ran tease about the

760.089 --> 765.1890000000001
moon-landing I didn't see it although so

763.839 --> 766.6890000000001
I don't know if I missed something

765.189 --> 770.23
really special about it

766.689 --> 773.3689999999999
and then there was lift veil about this

770.23 --> 779.35
weird Garlic Festival shooting

773.369 --> 781.239
apparently some vampires took a stand or

779.35 --> 783.0690000000001
a vampire didn't know sorry that's

781.239 --> 786.999
really bad to make a joke about that but

783.069 --> 790.4799999999999
I have no idea about the situation

786.999 --> 792.809
the fake or norm fake level it I don't

790.48 --> 796.7090000000001
know lift the veil gave his preliminary

792.809 --> 800.23
reading that it's probably just real

796.709 --> 801.7589999999999
that's what I felt from it and I'm not

800.23 --> 808.2090000000001
gonna get too much into it but that

801.759 --> 812.41
happened apparently a lot has been

808.209 --> 814.6289999999999
happening you know a lot of us god yeah

812.41 --> 816.579
I'd have to be like a news reader and

814.629 --> 819.419
have a separate program just to go

816.579 --> 824.529
through the regular news of weird

819.419 --> 826.629
situations happening you know everybody

824.529 --> 831.069
seems to be panicking over the whole app

826.629 --> 834.08
scene in supposed suicide attempt which

831.069 --> 836.51
is kind of a weird situation because

834.08 --> 838.9100000000001
it's really unclear what is going on

836.51 --> 845.45
there there could there's so many angles

838.91 --> 847.52
to it this I also got to hear a couple

845.45 --> 851.8000000000001
of more details about him through lift

847.52 --> 851.8
of a oh god that guy is so disgusting

855.85 --> 866.15
he's like it really is just disgusting

859.99 --> 867.14
but I don't know was it a suicide

866.15 --> 870.23
attempt

867.14 --> 872.48
maybe maybe it was not seriously suicide

870.23 --> 880.1
maybe it was a suicide attempt that kind

872.48 --> 882.0500000000001
of like try to somehow put a good guy

880.1 --> 884.51
facing forward like he feels really

882.05 --> 885.62
guilty or something as ridiculous as I

884.51 --> 889.52
don't know either

885.62 --> 894.7
I shouldn't even get into that [ __ ] it's

889.52 --> 894.6999999999999
so disgusting and dark and criminal and

903.53 --> 910.13
oh really and rest that holy [ __ ] hello

907.04 --> 913.0999999999999
good to see you by the way I'm into the

910.13 --> 916.16
garlic shooting all right your your

913.1 --> 917.65
researching it Oh interesting of yeah

916.16 --> 921.65
dude if you find out something

917.65 --> 923.63
interesting about it or some what

921.65 --> 927.3199999999999
exactly happened if it was real then

923.63 --> 930.29
yeah I'd love to know because I'm

927.32 --> 934.61
getting a lot of mixed messages most

930.29 --> 937.9699999999999
seem to say that it's real but I don't

934.61 --> 948.47
know but glad to hear you're looking

937.97 --> 951.65
into it no I didn't catch the

948.47 --> 955.1800000000001
high-altitude balloon because I'm not

951.65 --> 955.18
that tall Daniel

961.54 --> 964.54
hmm

974.879 --> 982.99
right I did by the way also take a look

978.069 --> 986.259
did I mention that was it on Jaron he

982.99 --> 989.949
was taking a look at high-altitude

986.259 --> 992.439
footage in the night and it was pretty

989.949 --> 995.199
interesting to take note that stars were

992.439 --> 999.73
indeed visible during the night phase up

995.199 --> 1002.04
there that's new doesn't take away from

999.73 --> 1006.72
the fact though that if you launch

1002.04 --> 1009.329
balloons at the day that the blue

1006.72 --> 1011.37
daylight band narrows down further

1009.329 --> 1016.29
further to the Rison and that the upper

1011.37 --> 1021.12
part remains black but starless that is

1016.29 --> 1023.9699999999999
also pretty well-established in fact I

1021.12 --> 1028.339
could say so that's fascinating it's not

1023.97 --> 1031.89
a universal stars or never stars

1028.339 --> 1034.77
apparently the day and night cycle have

1031.89 --> 1039.0300000000002
a direct influence on what is visible in

1034.77 --> 1042.36
that black up there so that's something

1039.03 --> 1044.28
to keep in mind it's new data to me

1042.36 --> 1046.62
because I thought that would never stars

1044.28 --> 1049.95
or apparently if you go up there at

1046.62 --> 1051.4799999999998
night then there will be stars when in

1049.95 --> 1056.19
the black during the day

1051.48 --> 1058.669
there aren't any so yeah interesting

1056.19 --> 1058.669
stuff

1065.42 --> 1072.3500000000001
oh really what what about it rest of

1068.75 --> 1078.37
what because I had my doubts getting it

1072.35 --> 1078.37
going into it but I don't know I did

1078.85 --> 1091.25
isn't it kind of logical in a way there

1088.46 --> 1096.95
haven't been that many night balloon

1091.25 --> 1099.98
launches so and that was always the

1096.95 --> 1105.23
typical issue that when the balloons go

1099.98 --> 1108.26
high up it will become black even during

1105.23 --> 1111.59
the day but that no stars were visible

1108.26 --> 1116.69
during the day in that black and that's

1111.59 --> 1118.79
always been very curious but well there

1116.69 --> 1122.299
haven't been that many night launches

1118.79 --> 1124.9099999999999
and well if this night launch just shows

1122.299 --> 1130.309
that there will be stars visible in that

1124.91 --> 1132.6200000000001
black even high up well that's just why

1130.309 --> 1135.62
would you expect there not to be

1132.62 --> 1139.4189999999999
necessarily they haven't been it hasn't

1135.62 --> 1141.6789999999999
been tested that many times so hey look

1139.419 --> 1143.48
there's the issue you know if you have

1141.679 --> 1146.6000000000001
real serious doubts about it there's

1143.48 --> 1149.57
only one way to falsify it and that's to

1146.6 --> 1153.83
repeat the experiment and then see if it

1149.57 --> 1157.9099999999999
results in the same thing so yeah maybe

1153.83 --> 1159.5
we need more night launches to see if

1157.91 --> 1166.63
it's really real or if we've been

1159.5 --> 1171.65
tricked and from there we can move on

1166.63 --> 1173.66
with the data are there stars in the

1171.65 --> 1177.6200000000001
black during the night when there aren't

1173.66 --> 1181.27
during the day in that same black well

1177.62 --> 1185.03
that's just a separate data pretty

1181.27 --> 1187.28
fascinating to consider you know however

1185.03 --> 1190.4289999999999
you're going to conceptualize that

1187.28 --> 1192.35
things are working right so yeah it's

1190.429 --> 1195.19
just another piece of data for the big

1192.35 --> 1195.1899999999998
puzzle to me

1195.39 --> 1204.8700000000001
and it is fascinating how these little

1197.429 --> 1210.1100000000001
things can give more development it also

1204.87 --> 1214.049
reveals how much has been pre assumed

1210.11 --> 1217.02
from the start when following certain

1214.049 --> 1219.99
paths certain ideas that are almost

1217.02 --> 1223.59
automatically certain types of

1219.99 --> 1225.36
structures come with it per default but

1223.59 --> 1227.1599999999999
now that more time is passed and we're

1225.36 --> 1230.85
looking literally at the details

1227.16 --> 1234.15
literally trying to experiment and

1230.85 --> 1238.559
rebuild it that now we figure out wait

1234.15 --> 1241.5300000000002
some of those things that were said were

1238.559 --> 1247.32
kind of assumed and not really factually

1241.53 --> 1250.23
checked and that's good because those

1247.32 --> 1253.83
things were really only there just to

1250.23 --> 1255.78
solidify the structure for the spirit to

1253.83 --> 1259.08
focus on in the time because it's new

1255.78 --> 1261.12
you gotta make it tangible to deal with

1259.08 --> 1264.059
so you got to fill in some of the blanks

1261.12 --> 1269.8799999999999
and make it feel and seem the most

1264.059 --> 1273.03
logical and reasonable but now the time

1269.88 --> 1275.19
is progressing we are definitely filling

1273.03 --> 1278.07
in the blanks and approaching it even

1275.19 --> 1280.38
more realistically because it's not so

1278.07 --> 1283.02
fresh anymore and we had we have had

1280.38 --> 1286.5200000000002
time to let it all sink in and fill in

1283.02 --> 1286.52
the blanks for real

1298.98 --> 1310.04
right alright well one of the new the

1307.04 --> 1315.33
things that I am really interested in

1310.04 --> 1316.92
concerning alternative subjects one of

1315.33 --> 1320.22
the questions that I'm gonna keep on

1316.92 --> 1323.16
asking people in general because I want

1320.22 --> 1326.13
it to be a question that is going to be

1323.16 --> 1328.5600000000002
generally asked I would appreciate it if

1326.13 --> 1333.99
it would move even up to mainstream

1328.56 --> 1338.3999999999999
circles where it is questioned not if

1333.99 --> 1341.04
there are chemtrails but what the

1338.4 --> 1342.8700000000001
chemtrails are what it exactly is

1341.04 --> 1345.96
they're spraying at the current time

1342.87 --> 1349.3799999999999
because in the past tests have been done

1345.96 --> 1352.05
and come from widespread tests back then

1349.38 --> 1354.2700000000002
and we're talking a decade and more it

1352.05 --> 1358.23
was concluded that there have been

1354.27 --> 1361.8899999999999
introduced a little aluminum dioxide and

1358.23 --> 1363.66
barium salts among others and even fungi

1361.89 --> 1365.76
and all kinds of weird stuff but

1363.66 --> 1369.15
especially the barium salt and the

1365.76 --> 1372.51
aluminum were significantly present and

1369.15 --> 1375.42
I'm just wondering is that still what

1372.51 --> 1379.1299999999999
they're doing is that the substance

1375.42 --> 1383.28
they're still spraying or have they now

1379.13 --> 1385.7700000000002
moved on to more durable and very

1383.28 --> 1389.07
environmentally friendly methods of

1385.77 --> 1393.87
altering the weather as I've suggested

1389.07 --> 1396.81
using fine sand basically creating a

1393.87 --> 1400.59
like an artificial dust cloud to help

1396.81 --> 1403.1699999999998
rain formation just spray the dust

1400.59 --> 1405.99
instead of letting it be blown up in the

1403.17 --> 1409.38
stratosphere through the deserts like

1405.99 --> 1412.56
that is that what they're doing are they

1409.38 --> 1414.18
spraying this this chemical waste to

1412.56 --> 1415.2
screw everything up or are they just

1414.18 --> 1420.15
spraying

1415.2 --> 1423.45
fine dust I want to know I want to know

1420.15 --> 1426.51
if they're still spraying the toxic

1423.45 --> 1430.01
stuff or if they've really gone forward

1426.51 --> 1433.01
to more sensible weather management

1430.01 --> 1433.01
because

1433.63 --> 1439.5500000000002
until we know people are going to

1436.79 --> 1441.77
generally either be totally ignoring

1439.55 --> 1444.32
everything about it because they can't

1441.77 --> 1447.29
handle it or they will be more inclined

1444.32 --> 1450.95
to go completely paranoid and like worry

1447.29 --> 1452.96
everyday and cringe and hurt every time

1450.95 --> 1454.3400000000001
they see a camera because they literally

1452.96 --> 1459.22
assume they're being sprayed with

1454.34 --> 1464.12
anthrax basically so it would help for

1459.22 --> 1466.58
both directions if there were new tests

1464.12 --> 1469.79
done to really figure out what is it

1466.58 --> 1472.79
there and spraying right now I want to

1469.79 --> 1475.61
know this I want fresh tests I want

1472.79 --> 1477.29
fresh the samples to be tested I want to

1475.61 --> 1482.8999999999999
see if it's still the same stuff they're

1477.29 --> 1485.1499999999999
doing so that's one of the things that I

1482.9 --> 1487.2800000000002
will be bringing up considering

1485.15 --> 1488.93
chemtrails and what everyone has to say

1487.28 --> 1490.99
about if people are going to debate no

1488.93 --> 1493.22
chemtrails are real they're poisoning us

1490.99 --> 1495.26
against our that's all [ __ ] it's all

1493.22 --> 1496.52
just moisture I know you just think you

1495.26 --> 1498.71
do those are just paranoid conspiracy

1496.52 --> 1500.78
when I see those people talking I will

1498.71 --> 1503.39
be there no geoengineering is fully

1500.78 --> 1507.05
admitted I just want to know if they're

1503.39 --> 1510.14
still using the tested confirmed poisons

1507.05 --> 1513.32
or if they've now switched to a more

1510.14 --> 1517.15
sensible product for it that's what I'm

1513.32 --> 1517.1499999999999
gonna insert every time I see that

1524.34 --> 1531.61
yeah that peanuts clerk indeed that

1527.77 --> 1533.32
would also be a good reason to switch to

1531.61 --> 1536.02
a less toxic substance for

1533.32 --> 1538.86
geoengineering indeed because they have

1536.02 --> 1538.86
to live there as well

1545.4 --> 1548.469
[Music]

1552.21 --> 1555.43
[Music]

1563.07 --> 1567.9089999999999
what is the most abundant element in the

1565.899 --> 1574.36
Earth's soil that is completely natural

1567.909 --> 1579.999
silicon as I said find particular dust

1574.36 --> 1582.9399999999998
of the silicon type sand super fine sand

1579.999 --> 1585.119
that if you'd had it in powder form

1582.94 --> 1590.74
added some water it would turn to clay

1585.119 --> 1592.809
that level carbon why would you spray

1590.74 --> 1595.809
carbon that carbon has all kinds of

1592.809 --> 1605.6789999999999
weird electromagnetic influences and in

1595.809 --> 1609.97
its clenchy it's sticky no look the

1605.679 --> 1615.1000000000001
thing is it happens with fine dust from

1609.97 --> 1617.8790000000001
sand naturally I remember that that it

1615.1 --> 1620.4989999999998
would sand would blow over

1617.879 --> 1623.2199999999998
so if that can happen naturally and

1620.499 --> 1632.47
influence things why wouldn't it be

1623.22 --> 1635.34
utilized okay that's a bit over the top

1632.47 --> 1635.34
there PGA

1641.68 --> 1650.3200000000002
i I don't know stop a traffic and my

1647.89 --> 1652.8700000000001
rest had all that I know is that I

1650.32 --> 1655.3899999999999
remember that it's been confirmed that

1652.87 --> 1659.5
they did indeed spray aluminum and

1655.39 --> 1663.0700000000002
barium salts I was with people that

1659.5 --> 1665.35
actually did the testing themselves did

1663.07 --> 1667.09
the laboratory testing themselves were

1665.35 --> 1670.1499999999999
overseeing that because they were very

1667.09 --> 1672.25
paranoid because they've had been

1670.15 --> 1674.73
experiencing people and lawyers

1672.25 --> 1679.03
bothering them and infiltrators

1674.73 --> 1681.82
literally sabotaging their processes so

1679.03 --> 1683.71
they were quite paranoid overseeing it

1681.82 --> 1687.82
and making sure that there was no

1683.71 --> 1689.68
trickery and it was all real they were

1687.82 --> 1692.08
concerned about that and they figured

1689.68 --> 1694.1200000000001
out yes it's it is aluminum yes it is

1692.08 --> 1698.37
barium salts and yes there are some

1694.12 --> 1701.4699999999998
mysterious and identified fungi in there

1698.37 --> 1704.8899999999999
of which the origins can be traced to

1701.47 --> 1707.56
anything in nature directly that kind of

1704.89 --> 1710.5900000000001
[ __ ] but that was ten years ago so what

1707.56 --> 1713.05
are they spraying now that's what I want

1710.59 --> 1717.4299999999998
to know and we can imagine about it all

1713.05 --> 1720.3999999999999
we want we n look I imagine that Rasta

1717.43 --> 1723.1200000000001
has as of has experienced a lot of

1720.4 --> 1725.8300000000002
issues with chemtrails and I believe him

1723.12 --> 1728.1699999999998
because he's in California and probably

1725.83 --> 1731.55
California is one of the most chemtrail

1728.17 --> 1735.8500000000001
assaulted regions in the world probably

1731.55 --> 1738.6699999999998
but that's not everywhere though that's

1735.85 --> 1740.05
California so I'm really curious what

1738.67 --> 1742.18
are they doing in the Netherlands are

1740.05 --> 1747.34
they doing that chemical [ __ ] here as

1742.18 --> 1749.8600000000001
well because I don't know I expect

1747.34 --> 1753.28
nature to be suffering a lot more here

1749.86 --> 1755.74
if that were the case and I don't know

1753.28 --> 1759.28
nature seems to be doing just great over

1755.74 --> 1761.59
here so I may be in California they're

1759.28 --> 1764.83
still spraying all that goop and the

1761.59 --> 1766.6499999999999
disgusting metal stuff and in other

1764.83 --> 1770.56
regions they're spraying other things

1766.65 --> 1773.23
that's why we need the testing again and

1770.56 --> 1775.059
again it's like if you want to check

1773.23 --> 1778.259
water quality of a certain

1775.059 --> 1781.72
River you don't just check it once and

1778.259 --> 1783.279
then after 10 years or 20 years assume

1781.72 --> 1785.499
that it's going to be exactly the same

1783.279 --> 1796.84
because all kinds of things could change

1785.499 --> 1799.749
you have to retest it so I hope there

1796.84 --> 1803.769
will there will be some new interest in

1799.749 --> 1806.919
that but not just chemtrail spotting

1803.769 --> 1809.35
because everybody can now spot it you

1806.919 --> 1813.5700000000002
know and you either ignore it or you are

1809.35 --> 1813.57
into it and you know stuff about it

1829.3 --> 1832.3
hmm

1839.16 --> 1841.88
right

1845.47 --> 1848.3700000000001
hmm

1867.16 --> 1874.3700000000001
yeah I'm lucky to new people just keep

1871.55 --> 1877.07
on sizing me up 15 years younger than

1874.37 --> 1880.9899999999998
I'm actually am really makes me happy

1877.07 --> 1883.82
every time that it's not become a stick

1880.99 --> 1886.49
where I keep on saying that to my

1883.82 --> 1888.8899999999999
friends where they're gonna be like oh

1886.49 --> 1891.53
yeah oh you're are when you look so

1888.89 --> 1894.3500000000001
young because that would be really

1891.53 --> 1896.87
annoying no I I just genuinely asked two

1894.35 --> 1899.99
people that had never met before and not

1896.87 --> 1904.4899999999998
in front of my friends or anything so

1899.99 --> 1909.05
they get a genuine answer and it seems

1904.49 --> 1909.38
to be aimed at no 2527 so happy about

1909.05 --> 1917.809
that

1909.38 --> 1919.8400000000001
I think the moustache may be helping as

1917.809 --> 1919.84
well

1934.429 --> 1942.1490000000001
anyway I'm glad that I would be sized up

1937.799 --> 1947.759
as 25 and others 18 because that means

1942.149 --> 1950.4899999999998
at least I I don't look frail cuz at 18

1947.759 --> 1953.429
I think a lot of guys still are

1950.49 --> 1958.31
relatively frail compared to how they

1953.429 --> 1961.5500000000002
will develop up until their mid-20s

1958.31 --> 1961.55
[Music]

1961.82 --> 1971.85
although for me I looked really the same

1966.75 --> 1975.21
I think I had a little bit more yeah

1971.85 --> 1977.9089999999999
more fat like what they say baby fat I

1975.21 --> 1981.0900000000001
think in the face so I was a little less

1977.909 --> 1985.74
pronounced with with the contours of my

1981.09 --> 1988.11
face in my 20s in my early 20s but other

1985.74 --> 1990.84
than that I think my general build and

1988.11 --> 1995.85
my overall muscles were pretty much the

1990.84 --> 1998.6999999999998
same it's really like if you compare the

1995.85 --> 2003.799
photos it's just remarkable how much I

1998.7 --> 2008.21
haven't changed so at least on the

2003.799 --> 2010.809
outside move man how much I have changed

2008.21 --> 2010.809
on the inside

2012.33 --> 2017.039
well better than the other way around by

2014.83 --> 2017.039
the way

2025.02 --> 2027.8
mmm

2040.37 --> 2047.86
what are you talking about BJ or rather

2044.54 --> 2047.86
who are you talking about

2054.609 --> 2064.97
thank you a lot II I actually considered

2059.899 --> 2073.49
shaving it off at some point but all

2064.97 --> 2074.859
right PJ now come on AJ is that's

2073.49 --> 2078.109
ridiculous dude

2074.859 --> 2082.25
AJ does not have a super a superiority

2078.109 --> 2085.639
complex that's that's just wrong that's

2082.25 --> 2088.329
totally wrong he doesn't AJ just has

2085.639 --> 2093.8
this weird effect where he can kind of

2088.329 --> 2097.67
get drunk on preaching he has the the

2093.8 --> 2101.0890000000004
soapbox effect put him on a soapbox and

2097.67 --> 2104.66
he will start to make stories and get

2101.089 --> 2106.88
dramatic about that's AJ right AJ but he

2104.66 --> 2108.47
is not doesn't have a super high aura t

2106.88 --> 2111.109
complex that's just nonsense

2108.47 --> 2113.99
HMS ferry is a very modest person

2111.109 --> 2117.13
actually he can just get a bit

2113.99 --> 2117.1299999999997
enthusiastic sometimes

2124.17 --> 2131.92
watch stories I don't know it's when you

2129.79 --> 2135.37
get all caps lock and Biblical and stuff

2131.92 --> 2145.27
and especially when you go in overkill

2135.37 --> 2148.7999999999997
mode with that yes I do a gym if I had

2145.27 --> 2148.8
not probably already banned you

2177.25 --> 2180.25
yeah

2187.78 --> 2200.9300000000003
so would Christ no me so are you saying

2197.65 --> 2204.6800000000003
if I would be facing off with Jesus

2200.93 --> 2208.64
right now would he would he reject me

2204.68 --> 2209.41
based on um my energies and everything I

2208.64 --> 2216.3799999999997
do

2209.41 --> 2221.06
well I certainly hope not I I dare not

2216.38 --> 2225.53
say I think I would be okay but I'm

2221.06 --> 2229.819
terrified I wouldn't be might I do my

2225.53 --> 2232.869
best so I'll leave it to God I just I

2229.819 --> 2232.869
couldn't say

2254.46 --> 2258.92
now that's just wrong

2265.12 --> 2273.02
Jason mcCormick sorry but Jesus died for

2269.15 --> 2279.85
our sins okay calling him and hypocrite

2273.02 --> 2279.85
is just is is really really [ __ ]

2280.72 --> 2289.7
from any perspective ie this is you

2286.34 --> 2292.1800000000003
might want to step back take a step back

2289.7 --> 2292.18
right there

2298.13 --> 2304.369
okay okay okay that's okay yeah PJ look

2302.809 --> 2313.989
I don't really like where you're going

2304.369 --> 2313.989
with this [ __ ] you know it's just

2316.93 --> 2322.759
painting with numbers and conspiracy

2320.38 --> 2337.489
connections is kind of a waste of time

2322.759 --> 2344.509
in my opinion no Anubis Barbara that's

2337.489 --> 2346.91
not true he did choose to die by he knew

2344.509 --> 2349.819
what was gonna happen he definitely did

2346.91 --> 2351.739
choose to it was not against his choice

2349.819 --> 2355.0389999999998
he knew what was gonna happen he even

2351.739 --> 2358.819
said he did he knew the consequences of

2355.039 --> 2361.63
of the chain of events he definitely did

2358.819 --> 2365.69
choose but he had to because otherwise

2361.63 --> 2369.44
what's the purpose of it his purpose was

2365.69 --> 2376.279
there to be the example the path the

2369.44 --> 2378.91
right frequency and to resolve an

2376.279 --> 2378.91
ancient issue

2405.29 --> 2412.31
yeah that's hilarious Anubis Barbara I

2409.04 --> 2414.71
like that remark the Bible is not a

2412.31 --> 2419.93
history book it is a book of stories

2414.71 --> 2422.45
based on real events well there are some

2419.93 --> 2425.6
real testimonies in there though with

2422.45 --> 2428.8399999999997
names and locations and descriptions of

2425.6 --> 2430.73
landmarks and I think even so I'm not

2428.84 --> 2434.26
sure that's entirely correct I think

2430.73 --> 2437.12
that the Bible definitely does contain

2434.26 --> 2439.07
incredible historical detail for a book

2437.12 --> 2446.5099999999998
of that time probably more than any

2439.07 --> 2451.78
other oh god I don't know rest I had I

2446.51 --> 2454.1000000000004
don't know what Dell is up to Dell is I

2451.78 --> 2459.92
don't know what the hell is wrong with

2454.1 --> 2462.5299999999997
Dell but that guy is it's just I don't

2459.92 --> 2464.03
even especially when he gets like this I

2462.53 --> 2465.71
don't even want to mention him because

2464.03 --> 2468.6800000000003
the only thing he's gonna take for it is

2465.71 --> 2470.69
just more troll targeting he's just

2468.68 --> 2474.22
attacking people and he's siding with

2470.69 --> 2479.15
bad parties and he is just overall--

2474.22 --> 2481.49
openly corrupting and I have no idea why

2479.15 --> 2485.36
people even pay attention to him at this

2481.49 --> 2487.91
point except they just want to see how

2485.36 --> 2492.08
he blows himself up that's the only

2487.91 --> 2494.33
reason I could remember I could figure

2492.08 --> 2496.94
out why people would be following him at

2494.33 --> 2499.37
this point or maybe they just think his

2496.94 --> 2501.29
Scottish accent is sexy or something and

2499.37 --> 2508.88
it's tattooed I don't know anymore I

2501.29 --> 2511.85
just think you know okay I'm Arwen I

2508.88 --> 2513.8
talk a lot it's just me my and my face

2511.85 --> 2517.46
on camera talking a lot about the things

2513.8 --> 2519.44
and reasoning and yeah Dell is kind of

2517.46 --> 2522.08
the same thing it's just him talking on

2519.44 --> 2527.42
stream the only difference is I actually

2522.08 --> 2530.0299999999997
talk about things that have meaning and

2527.42 --> 2533.3
importance and development and he just

2530.03 --> 2535.1000000000004
claims about people all day and tells

2533.3 --> 2538.0600000000004
how we're not doing the right thing and

2535.1 --> 2538.06
nothing is ever good enough

2539.599 --> 2543.289
if you know what I mean

2543.78 --> 2546.929
[Music]

2569.36 --> 2573.4190000000003
[Music]

2577.369 --> 2590.42
who knows Anubis Barbara maybe he got

2580.489 --> 2592.67
her all suckered I'd certainly like to

2590.42 --> 2593.4790000000003
see somebody try approach me in that

2592.67 --> 2615.7290000000003
fashion

2593.479 --> 2615.729
I got a bow and a noise yeah

2649.33 --> 2659.2
I don't know PJ you make a point that is

2656.29 --> 2663.39
kind of substantial but it's over

2659.2 --> 2663.39
generalization I think all them

2671.47 --> 2677.3489999999997
the stories are crafted for the

2673.359 --> 2679.3289999999997
realization of Jesus and God within they

2677.349 --> 2683.099
will have you externalize everything

2679.329 --> 2684.4500000000003
until the end yeah well in all the pens

2683.099 --> 2689.77
it

2684.45 --> 2692.74
it's about there's what the Bible

2689.77 --> 2695.349
teaches and each people its persons

2692.74 --> 2698.77
individual lessons that they take from

2695.349 --> 2701.6800000000003
it dependent on their mindset and where

2698.77 --> 2705.609
they are in their lives and then there

2701.68 --> 2708.46
is the elders or wiser people or people

2705.609 --> 2710.41
that those people would trust that would

2708.46 --> 2715.119
know and study a lot more about the

2710.41 --> 2717.67
Bible and what they hand them so if they

2715.119 --> 2720.88
hand them refined detailed information

2717.67 --> 2725.289
about the Bible in a certain context

2720.88 --> 2727.119
then they can manipulate their crowd to

2725.289 --> 2729.4300000000003
think in a certain way to indeed

2727.119 --> 2733.1800000000003
externalize God and say that it is

2729.43 --> 2735.52
dependent upon a wise person somebody

2733.18 --> 2740.3689999999997
that can sufficiently understand God or

2735.52 --> 2742.9
on a initiated priest specifically yes

2740.369 --> 2744.789
that is externalizing God that is

2742.9 --> 2747.599
actually disconnecting it it's the

2744.789 --> 2750.849
church it's one of the elements that

2747.599 --> 2754.51
really makes church nuts be not so good

2750.849 --> 2757.599
in general but that's not Christianity

2754.51 --> 2761.789
itself that's actually the social

2757.599 --> 2765.1600000000003
constructs that form under the guise of

2761.789 --> 2768.7000000000003
Christianity it's the church formation

2765.16 --> 2771.7
that does that not Christianity because

2768.7 --> 2777.96
real Christianity is an individual and

2771.7 --> 2782.109
they're reflection upon the book it is

2777.96 --> 2786.16
supposed to be men helping you really

2782.109 --> 2788.47
find God in yourself and if that's not

2786.16 --> 2790.029
the way you're going then you're then

2788.47 --> 2792.8089999999997
you're saving the path then you are

2790.029 --> 2792.809
going wrong

2831.72 --> 2834.3799999999997
gosh

2841.55 --> 2845.15
although I might think I'm

2863.77 --> 2867.48
poof sorry yeah yeah

2870.78 --> 2876.9
I got these weird tensions the past few

2873.359 --> 2880.2599999999998
days that in conjunction with the heat

2876.9 --> 2882.39
sometimes makes me nauseated out of

2880.26 --> 2885.8300000000004
nowhere I don't know it's really

2882.39 --> 2889.08
annoying I'm okay

2885.83 --> 2892.3199999999997
it's just that sometimes it just comes

2889.08 --> 2894.81
out of nowhere it it's weird it's like a

2892.32 --> 2897.119
weird sensation like I almost have to

2894.81 --> 2900.15
throw up it just never gets there thank

2897.119 --> 2911.2200000000003
God but it does really bring you out of

2900.15 --> 2914.33
it for a moment I don't know I think

2911.22 --> 2914.33
it's mostly just tension

2931.51 --> 2936.8100000000004
an ice called joint how does that work

2937.2 --> 2946.41
I'm pretty sure a joint requires fire to

2941.8 --> 2946.4100000000003
smoke I mean

2964.32 --> 2973.48
I'm so sad arrested that that they let

2970.06 --> 2976.39
you let liberal culture ruin the word

2973.48 --> 2979.53
bear for you I'm so sad for you I'll

2976.39 --> 2986.3799999999997
never let let that happen

2979.53 --> 2989.7400000000002
you know if it's a matter of bear okay

2986.38 --> 2992.349
just put a bear next to a bear and then

2989.74 --> 3004.83
let's see who is the real bear here okay

2992.349 --> 3012.0
if you know what I mean [ __ ] you

3004.83 --> 3015.18
know don't it's gonna sound so wrong

3012.0 --> 3019.68
just when it comes down to is don't let

3015.18 --> 3022.74
the [ __ ] steal all the words and use

3019.68 --> 3026.6699999999996
them as stickers to mean themselves

3022.74 --> 3029.5499999999997
don't let them assimilate all language

3026.67 --> 3038.4300000000003
to mean them because that is what they

3029.55 --> 3041.13
do do you understand do you

3038.43 --> 3041.5989999999997
it's historically accurate what I'm

3041.13 --> 3046.5
saying

3041.599 --> 3050.01
they steal words then they popularize it

3046.5 --> 3053.46
to mean something relating to gay or a

3050.01 --> 3057.7200000000003
gay issue or anything that is gay in

3053.46 --> 3060.599
some way and then they force that into

3057.72 --> 3063.5699999999997
the public and then suddenly that word

3060.599 --> 3066.57
now means gay instead of what it

3063.57 --> 3073.8590000000004
originally meant that is what they do

3066.57 --> 3074.88
and I refuse that's when I call somebody

3073.859 --> 3078.5989999999997
a [ __ ]

3074.88 --> 3082.6800000000003
i I'm not I'm not even saying they're

3078.599 --> 3086.25
gay I'm just saying no you're an old an

3082.68 --> 3089.45
old whiny [ __ ] that's what a fact used

3086.25 --> 3092.63
to be an old woman carrying twigs

3089.45 --> 3092.6299999999997
complaining all day

3093.95 --> 3104.85
it's the gay rape of the lexicon Wow Wow

3099.45 --> 3120.62
that that is exactly what that is Colin

3104.85 --> 3120.62
Turner well done well done right

3129.859 --> 3139.88
yeah or basically twisting and bending

3133.489 --> 3145.809
language to make all words and all

3139.88 --> 3149.329
meanings facilitate towards but pumping

3145.809 --> 3152.2690000000002
dumpster pumping so all language becomes

3149.329 --> 3154.309
an expression of dumpster pumping that's

3152.269 --> 3156.3489999999997
what they're trying it's what they have

3154.309 --> 3163.9100000000003
been trying for the last hundred years

3156.349 --> 3167.42
probably maybe more so in the end one of

3163.91 --> 3173.5989999999997
the few words that'll be in the minds of

3167.42 --> 3179.41
the general public will be ass and [ __ ]

3173.599 --> 3183.259
and just like yeah but you think that's

3179.41 --> 3185.779
coming there by accident or you think

3183.259 --> 3190.279
that that may have been persistently

3185.779 --> 3198.89
rammed into the minds of the general

3190.279 --> 3201.619
culture for control and profit and to

3198.89 --> 3203.719
enhance their gaze stocks there but

3201.619 --> 3205.789
pumping stocks they need more but pump

3203.719 --> 3207.89
stocks so you need more about pump

3205.789 --> 3211.219
culture so you change language into

3207.89 --> 3216.4
blood pumping and by then by doing that

3211.219 --> 3216.4
you breed more Bob but pumping stocks

3216.759 --> 3221.9
Wow

3218.859 --> 3224.959
couldn't perfect timing thank you :

3221.9 --> 3227.059
Turner for the Wow 20 pound super chat

3224.959 --> 3227.5389999999998
donation that's amazing man thank you so

3227.059 --> 3230.599
much

3227.539 --> 3232.67
keep your walsim chat show going it's

3230.599 --> 3235.4300000000003
one of the very few walls some things on

3232.67 --> 3237.079
offer on the Internet Wow I am honored

3235.43 --> 3241.1499999999996
that you would say something like that I

3237.079 --> 3246.7690000000002
I do my best I try always to stay

3241.15 --> 3249.4990000000003
genuine to get out on the edge but not

3246.769 --> 3251.8999999999996
to try to overstep it I'm definitely not

3249.499 --> 3256.819
an Owen Benjamin and I'm not a sacred

3251.9 --> 3261.369
cow slaughterhouse but I do I do like to

3256.819 --> 3261.369
test the sacred cows as it were

3263.45 --> 3274.9199999999996
and I'll not get stuck on old paradigms

3268.619 --> 3277.079
that have no more function so right

3274.92 --> 3278.819
that's what I do anyway super a super

3277.079 --> 3283.13
thank you man that's just awesome you've

3278.819 --> 3283.13
been such support in the last few months

3283.25 --> 3287.0
it means a lot to me

3293.18 --> 3301.14
but it's pretty crazy right but yet when

3296.609 --> 3309.3289999999997
you think about it I said it's so raw

3301.14 --> 3314.49
and yet it is so true yeah so just

3309.329 --> 3319.9500000000003
imagine you're a guy you've been dealing

3314.49 --> 3324.6899999999996
a fight by your peers your brethren in

3319.95 --> 3327.569
money to become a bot pumper to convince

3324.69 --> 3330.78
yourself you're gay in order to be part

3327.569 --> 3332.819
of the team and then suddenly everybody

3330.78 --> 3334.5890000000004
just started yet you're gonna be bored

3332.819 --> 3336.66
with your fellow bot pumpers really

3334.589 --> 3339.77
quickly because there's no real love

3336.66 --> 3342.24
there's no connection so you're gonna

3339.77 --> 3345.45
automatically want more but pumping

3342.24 --> 3348.39
stocks right fresh BOTS to pump that's

3345.45 --> 3351.359
what they all want all the gays so or

3348.39 --> 3353.5789999999997
most of them anyway so what do you do

3351.359 --> 3356.79
well you use your money and your power

3353.579 --> 3359.1600000000003
and your control to program more but

3356.79 --> 3364.29
pumping in culture so more people will

3359.16 --> 3368.04
then be seduced and gradually dragged

3364.29 --> 3371.13
into this normalization like oh yeah

3368.04 --> 3373.829
well gay is normal right everybody talks

3371.13 --> 3376.109
about gay sex and you get teeth you get

3373.829 --> 3378.059
taught about but pumping in school when

3376.109 --> 3381.21
you're fine so I guess it's all normal

3378.059 --> 3384.599
now I can just oh I could go a little

3381.21 --> 3387.78
gay nobody cares and before you know it

3384.599 --> 3391.98
yeah you got butt pump stocks so that's

3387.78 --> 3393.6000000000004
what they do they're breeding dumpster

3391.98 --> 3395.43
pumping stocks there

3393.6 --> 3397.89
really growing their market so they

3395.43 --> 3398.91
always have fresh what's the pump on in

3397.89 --> 3401.73
every age

3398.91 --> 3403.94
on every age category that's what

3401.73 --> 3403.94
they're doing

3411.49 --> 3420.91
it is normal indeed and I am not

3414.7 --> 3423.7
accepting it now I Mack look if I'd be

3420.91 --> 3426.91
tested I would definitely come out as a

3423.7 --> 3431.23
homophobic in a sense that I don't panic

3426.91 --> 3432.42
over that [ __ ] but I just don't like

3431.23 --> 3437.56
kids

3432.42 --> 3447.16
it just makes me annoyed so it would

3437.56 --> 3449.5
never work it was never gonna work every

3447.16 --> 3451.87
time even in the liberal times when I

3449.5 --> 3453.79
dealt with liberals when I still was

3451.87 --> 3455.65
growing in the concept like okay

3453.79 --> 3457.54
apparently if you're gay you were more

3455.65 --> 3459.19
respected and more popular among the

3457.54 --> 3462.37
youngsters in blah blah all that

3459.19 --> 3466.75
nonsense crap that's being enforced now

3462.37 --> 3469.2999999999997
I was there and I would just go like oh

3466.75 --> 3472.84
yeah yeah I'm all for gays guys yeah

3469.3 --> 3476.44
everybody you know why not I have no

3472.84 --> 3481.8700000000003
problem with it just but I did that all

3476.44 --> 3485.32
with just this mask because I'm not

3481.87 --> 3489.3399999999997
gonna engage in that now my friends knew

3485.32 --> 3494.6800000000003
that I just tried to not complain about

3489.34 --> 3497.05
it as much until I don't know things

3494.68 --> 3500.0499999999997
broke off between the friends circle way

3497.05 --> 3504.13
before it got really really bad with all

3500.05 --> 3508.1200000000003
the gay [ __ ] out there but even in the

3504.13 --> 3510.76
last year's with the last remnants of

3508.12 --> 3513.0699999999997
that friend circle they were always so

3510.76 --> 3515.0200000000004
pro gay and it just annoyed the [ __ ] out

3513.07 --> 3521.2200000000003
of me every time they started whining

3515.02 --> 3521.22
about that [ __ ] just it just agitates me

3522.88 --> 3527.789
[Music]

3525.079 --> 3532.579
and I'm just glad that I don't have to

3527.789 --> 3535.7400000000002
be around that nonsense anymore you know

3532.579 --> 3540.96
look let's just say in the future

3535.74 --> 3544.769
imagine all the liberal [ __ ] media

3540.96 --> 3549.2690000000002
and nonsense programming and gay yeah

3544.769 --> 3552.4199999999996
dumpster pump stir stockbreeding media

3549.269 --> 3555.4199999999996
is stopping you know and people get kind

3552.42 --> 3558.7690000000002
of back to normal normal morale I'd be

3555.42 --> 3565.2200000000003
the guy protecting the gay people from

3558.769 --> 3567.93
the backlash probably I'd be that guy

3565.22 --> 3570.98
even though they literally have been

3567.93 --> 3574.41
trying to get in my booth you know what

3570.98 --> 3576.75
four years and I hate them

3574.41 --> 3581.1299999999997
but I will be the one defending them in

3576.75 --> 3583.65
the end because I still think that I

3581.13 --> 3587.13
don't know I don't think it is wrong to

3583.65 --> 3590.309
be like that it's just what tends to

3587.13 --> 3594.2400000000002
come when you slide into it that's the

3590.309 --> 3597.119
problem and that's up to every

3594.24 --> 3601.109
individual how far they will let

3597.119 --> 3603.44
themselves slide outside of logos but it

3601.109 --> 3607.47
doesn't mean that if you are gay you are

3603.44 --> 3612.359
automatically a Satanist and that is the

3607.47 --> 3614.759
problem because the more these freaking

3612.359 --> 3617.99
Satanists will push the gay on

3614.759 --> 3620.759
everything and be gay in all of it and

3617.99 --> 3621.029
the harder the backlash will be in the

3620.759 --> 3624.599
end

3621.029 --> 3628.16
um the gay people that aren't totally

3624.599 --> 3628.1600000000003
disgusting individuals

3635.28 --> 3638.0
you know

3639.76 --> 3646.5400000000004
Oh white bear I do I totally do

3643.17 --> 3650.59
it just gets a bit annoying when you'd

3646.54 --> 3654.88
prefer females to actually go after you

3650.59 --> 3656.98
instead of guys because I think overall

3654.88 --> 3661.7200000000003
I probably did get more guys after me

3656.98 --> 3663.97
when I went out and then girls but I

3661.72 --> 3665.859
guess the guys are just quicker to move

3663.97 --> 3670.95
yeah especially gay guys are very quick

3665.859 --> 3673.2999999999997
to move on average huh mm-hmm Thank You

3670.95 --> 3675.1

3696.609 --> 3703.24
anyways thanks and super Thank You

3699.13 --> 3706.3900000000003
Amanda young I I strive to entertain and

3703.24 --> 3709.99
to educate but white bear maybe it's the

3706.39 --> 3713.35
mustache well I haven't had a mustache

3709.99 --> 3717.91
for that long you know I started growing

3713.35 --> 3720.91
a mustache even during the the early

3717.91 --> 3726.39
bird show which is not yeah it's just

3720.91 --> 3726.39
going for for three seasons now or

3727.78 --> 3737.6800000000003
[Music]

3730.39 --> 3745.48
2/3 2/3 of a year so I look and I had

3737.68 --> 3749.23
gay guys after me 25 years ago no even

3745.48 --> 3751.81
worse I still remember when I was wasn't

3749.23 --> 3753.67
even 20 yet in school I would have gay

3751.81 --> 3755.47
guys approaching me and be very

3753.67 --> 3757.81
disappointed when they got to hear from

3755.47 --> 3766.12
me that I'm not gay so it was even

3757.81 --> 3768.42
before that oh and let me tell you by

3766.12 --> 3768.42
the way

3768.48 --> 3774.3
gay guys really hate being rejected oh

3778.74 --> 3784.6499999999996
by the way I think anyone hates being

3782.26 --> 3784.65
rejected

3807.38 --> 3817.59
numbers Barbara if I didn't tell them

3810.0 --> 3820.8
then they just keep on trying that's the

3817.59 --> 3827.7200000000003
issue well wow I've been going for an

3820.8 --> 3827.7200000000003
hour month has flung that was very quick

3830.51 --> 3834.69
