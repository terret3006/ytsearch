drink coffee with my right hand

142.08 --> 146.48000000000002

173.28 --> 177.599
soon ah

174.319 --> 177.599
so yeah that's the reason

177.76 --> 184.0
anyway agm was first dank

181.36 --> 185.59900000000002
robin stanley missouri bear stopping

184.0 --> 189.68
traffic in my rafter hat

185.599 --> 194.319
rasta hat good servant haber

189.68 --> 198.48000000000002
and zd 20.00

194.319 --> 202.07999999999998
i'm right here right there

198.48 --> 205.04
amanda young dank

202.08 --> 205.04000000000002
robin stanley

208.08 --> 213.84
rest us getting impatient

214.0 --> 218.08
right i got you missouri bear right yeah

216.08 --> 221.28
i think i got you all

218.08 --> 221.28
morning saturday

221.68 --> 226.08
uh oh yeah and my sound may be a little

224.56 --> 229.92000000000002
bit different because uh

226.08 --> 233.12
i got a tip from nathan

229.92 --> 235.83999999999997
about the sound system so yeah

233.12 --> 240.08
to see if what is it called again i

235.84 --> 242.56
don't even freaking

240.08 --> 243.92000000000002
know what the name of that stuff is

242.56 --> 247.28
again

243.92 --> 251.2
again anyway it's the effect

247.28 --> 253.519
where the sound gets distorted when you

251.2 --> 254.48
raise your voice all of a sudden so i

253.519 --> 257.919
put some like

254.48 --> 261.759
limiter thingies and yeah sound

257.919 --> 265.19899999999996
capping and rearranging things in obs

261.759 --> 268.32
because nathan oakley pulled up a

265.199 --> 270.16
youtube video of some audio fanatic who

268.32 --> 273.04
basically explained it

270.16 --> 273.04
gain too high

273.759 --> 285.36
okay what does that mean

282.16 --> 286.24
so is my sound better or worse you know

285.36 --> 289.12
what i'm gonna

286.24 --> 289.12
check it myself

290.479 --> 294.639
because i have checked it with

292.4 --> 296.63899999999995
recordings

294.639 --> 298.56
i haven't actually checked it in any

296.639 --> 300.96000000000004
live situation

298.56 --> 302.08
i should have probably done a a test

300.96 --> 305.75899999999996
stream before this

302.08 --> 308.08
but i'm just gonna

305.759 --> 309.28000000000003
see what it sounds like right here so

308.08 --> 312.32
probably done a

309.28 --> 315.039
a test stream before this but

312.32 --> 316.479
that's just interesting see what it

315.039 --> 319.68
sounds like right here

316.479 --> 324.24
so probably done a test stream

319.68 --> 327.36
oh great that yeah that's just great

324.24 --> 327.36
obs picks up

330.639 --> 334.16
okay well enough of that

334.56 --> 340.16
did seem at least normal so right

342.24 --> 346.24
anyway if some trolls start to piss me

344.24 --> 349.44
off in chat and i get really loud

346.24 --> 353.199
then it should not like out

349.44 --> 356.319
blow the mic hopefully

353.199 --> 359.039
we'll see i don't know

356.319 --> 360.319
it's yeah it's a good little update for

359.039 --> 362.08
the sound system and

360.319 --> 364.56
i am willing to update you know the

362.08 --> 367.919
problem is i'm

364.56 --> 371.84
so much detail stuff and

367.919 --> 372.88
like i get the feel of what they're

371.84 --> 376.15999999999997
doing i just

372.88 --> 378.479
don't have that oversight

376.16 --> 380.08000000000004
well at least not now you know practice

378.479 --> 383.12
does make perfect

380.08 --> 383.12
but it seems all like

384.16 --> 390.0
to me it's

387.199 --> 392.40000000000003
intricate technicals like specific

390.0 --> 394.96
program specific

392.4 --> 395.84
orientations now oh well that should be

394.96 --> 398.56
uh

395.84 --> 398.56
it should be fine

399.36 --> 402.639
i figured out there is such an option in

401.6 --> 405.199
obs

402.639 --> 407.36
that's already kind of nice that i i i'm

405.199 --> 409.68
not

407.36 --> 412.0
going to be dependent on audio banana

409.68 --> 416.08
usage or something

412.0 --> 416.08
to work with that so yeah that's great

418.0 --> 425.919
right so

421.039 --> 429.199
yesterday i did not go to bed very early

425.919 --> 432.88
as a good servant can testify to

429.199 --> 435.44
because i hung around with him on skype

432.88 --> 438.319
just chatting for quite a while it's

435.44 --> 440.96
very chatty but it's also because

438.319 --> 441.36
hey what's that did you see the paypal

440.96 --> 444.56
there

441.36 --> 447.91900000000004
hmm okay

444.56 --> 450.319
i'll check that uh

447.919 --> 451.599
wait what is that saying um right i hung

450.319 --> 454.8
around

451.599 --> 457.039
because i yesterday i really like

454.8 --> 461.52000000000004
consciously decided not to take any beer

457.039 --> 463.599
i still had some wine and

461.52 --> 465.84
yeah that that was quite a challenge for

463.599 --> 465.84
me

466.72 --> 470.72
because of what beer really represents

469.919 --> 474.87899999999996
to me

470.72 --> 479.199
in opposition to wine because it is like

474.879 --> 480.96000000000004
a moment specific thing in the day

479.199 --> 482.639
where like everybody's kind of in the

480.96 --> 484.71999999999997
mood for that

482.639 --> 486.72
people told me like yeah we like drunk

484.72 --> 489.52000000000004
irwin

486.72 --> 491.44000000000005
but the problem is is that with beer

489.52 --> 493.52
yeah

491.44 --> 494.96
well one thing i noticed today

493.52 --> 498.96
immediately is

494.96 --> 500.87899999999996
i i did not have rage

498.96 --> 502.479
that was like remarkable because that's

500.879 --> 504.0
been a while

502.479 --> 506.0
right yeah by the way thank you for the

504.0 --> 508.24
20 super uh yeah paypal

506.0 --> 512.08
donation amanda young much appreciated

508.24 --> 512.08
thank you for your continuous support

512.159 --> 521.519
good things thank you so much

516.08 --> 527.519
i will do my best to uh to be worth it

521.519 --> 527.519
uh right but yeah it seems like

528.16 --> 533.12
right if i just drink a little wine

531.2 --> 535.6
in the evening it's not it doesn't have

533.12 --> 537.36
as much impact on my system

535.6 --> 539.76
now that i just took the beer away just

537.36 --> 543.2
one day

539.76 --> 543.2
seems like a world difference

543.279 --> 547.12
and even though i don't like that

544.8 --> 550.88
because i really like appreciate

547.12 --> 554.32
beer during those moments i'm just gonna

550.88 --> 556.56
keep this up for as long as i can i've

554.32 --> 557.36
said it many times before but this time

556.56 --> 562.3199999999999
i got

557.36 --> 563.92
more data oh what's going on and yeah

562.32 --> 567.7600000000001
the rage has been

563.92 --> 572.7199999999999
kind of unnerving to myself mostly

567.76 --> 575.279
so that's i guess found kind of a

572.72 --> 576.8000000000001
potential causal relationship at least

575.279 --> 578.88
in the moment

576.8 --> 581.76
like this seems to influence that that's

578.88 --> 581.76
how i do things

583.2 --> 590.399
i like i don't like to just drop things

586.88 --> 593.92
that i'm used to for no good reason

590.399 --> 593.92
i'm very much a habit guy

594.0 --> 597.76
i also have to be careful with what new

595.839 --> 605.839
habits i drag in

597.76 --> 605.8389999999999
because of that anyway

606.16 --> 608.48
what

615.68 --> 619.8389999999999
all right

622.399 --> 626.32
alien napalm okay

630.839 --> 635.6800000000001
right

633.44 --> 635.6800000000001
uh

636.959 --> 640.16
yeah i was on benjamin show yesterday

639.2 --> 643.76
was

640.16 --> 645.8389999999999
yeah just typical you know it keeps on

643.76 --> 648.079
going and it's great to be part of it in

645.839 --> 648.0790000000001
chat

649.79 --> 652.98
[Music]

656.0 --> 660.24
and it's it's really funny because of

658.079 --> 660.959
the the jokes and the angle and like the

660.24 --> 664.16
religious

660.959 --> 666.64
aspects and all that

664.16 --> 668.64
it yeah there's like this extra layer of

666.64 --> 669.4399999999999
synchronicity you just start to notice

668.64 --> 672.079
orbit

669.44 --> 673.36
not synchronicity more like yeah it's

672.079 --> 677.04
part of the design

673.36 --> 679.6800000000001
covertly and it has an effect

677.04 --> 680.56
and yeah it's really kind of sharpened

679.68 --> 684.7199999999999
my sight

680.56 --> 686.3199999999999
further and in a way it's funny because

684.72 --> 689.839
i remembered it

686.32 --> 693.279
because i have kind of been

689.839 --> 696.32
it had it pointed out to me before but

693.279 --> 699.76
i myself was not

696.32 --> 702.9590000000001
really ready to really deal

699.76 --> 704.8
with it anyway so i kind of like more

702.959 --> 706.2399999999999
just witnessed it in distance and then

704.8 --> 709.5999999999999
kind of thought like

706.24 --> 713.04
no i'm not confident enough to do

709.6 --> 716.0
anything with that like i i i

713.04 --> 716.56
yeah when i was young when that first

716.0 --> 719.76
basically

716.56 --> 719.76
it was pointed out to me

719.92 --> 724.16
uh right hammered the trinity yesterday

722.72 --> 725.2
that was it thanks for reminding me

724.16 --> 728.079
missouri bear i

725.2 --> 728.0790000000001
really appreciate it

729.68 --> 736.88
yeah well you know the trinity

733.68 --> 740.399
it's a complex thing very very complex

736.88 --> 743.4399999999999
but concerning the whole

740.399 --> 747.76
making across thing that

743.44 --> 750.0790000000001
that was good that was very perceptive

747.76 --> 750.959
it's something that kind of that i

750.079 --> 754.3199999999999
bumped into

750.959 --> 756.56
before as well about that

754.32 --> 758.0
when i was really testing the details of

756.56 --> 760.16
this when i was really trying to

758.0 --> 761.44
explore like what religions how does it

760.16 --> 764.8
work

761.44 --> 767.9200000000001
i think it was yeah it was probably

764.8 --> 771.1999999999999
in my late teens

767.92 --> 771.76
and yeah that that kind of stood out to

771.2 --> 774.639
me then

771.76 --> 776.48
as well but no nobody liked me

774.639 --> 779.839
questioning it

776.48 --> 782.72
back then so i got like this

779.839 --> 785.519
it's like just those don't interfere

782.72 --> 788.9590000000001
with our religion kind of feel

785.519 --> 793.2
like you you're being nitricky

788.959 --> 793.1999999999999
but yeah it's good to hear that back

793.44 --> 800.5600000000001
in in the state that i am right now

797.519 --> 803.279
it's much more confident and

800.56 --> 804.399
yeah he big bear always puts extra

803.279 --> 807.279
layers on top

804.399 --> 809.839
you really pushed it hard the release

807.279 --> 813.76
was stomping on some toes there

809.839 --> 816.9590000000001
but yeah he at least

813.76 --> 820.24
you know and this is he didn't [ __ ]

816.959 --> 821.5999999999999
he saw it and then he slaughtered that

820.24 --> 824.8
sacred cow

821.6 --> 828.0
just like that and i think that

824.8 --> 830.639
a lot of the chat did really respond

828.0 --> 830.639
well to it

831.279 --> 834.32
but there's always going to be some

832.48 --> 836.16
squirters here and there

834.32 --> 838.639
and then again there's like these kind

836.16 --> 840.88
of squirter bears people

838.639 --> 842.32
that are yeah they'll squirt on any

840.88 --> 844.079
occasion that's why they're there it's

842.32 --> 847.36
like they're there to provide

844.079 --> 852.0
the sport almost artistically

847.36 --> 854.5600000000001
this is i got some of those as well

852.0 --> 855.36
but yeah those are just types of people

854.56 --> 858.4799999999999
and they don't

855.36 --> 861.12
necessarily even mean well and mean

858.48 --> 863.279
anything to fairies right

861.12 --> 863.279
uh

868.16 --> 871.519
it's it's like to provide the contrast

870.24 --> 874.24
in a way

871.519 --> 875.12
i used to do that myself a lot but now i

874.24 --> 878.24
could like

875.12 --> 879.6
can't really afford myself to clown

878.24 --> 883.44
around

879.6 --> 887.6800000000001
to that level unless i have like a very

883.44 --> 891.2790000000001
in the moment good reason like some

887.68 --> 892.56
honor is being tarnished or some lies

891.279 --> 895.92
trying to be

892.56 --> 898.88
covertly worked in that will

895.92 --> 899.76
typically yeah drive me on the edge and

898.88 --> 901.8389999999999
then i might

899.76 --> 903.92
actually get really trollish or

901.839 --> 906.8800000000001
something you've seen it before

903.92 --> 906.88
how that works with me

911.04 --> 916.7199999999999
yo where's everybody in the chat what's

914.24 --> 916.72
going on

919.04 --> 927.8389999999999
it's been four minutes

933.68 --> 943.92
ah right what's going on here

940.639 --> 945.6
yay hey roman sonny

943.92 --> 948.959
i'm working on stuff and listening okay

945.6 --> 954.48
okay okay uh

948.959 --> 957.5999999999999
all right

954.48 --> 961.6800000000001
it's it's plenty warm

957.6 --> 962.16
um you should open the door somewhere

961.68 --> 965.2199999999999
it's

962.16 --> 967.6
it's also like because of the moistness

965.22 --> 970.639
[Music]

967.6 --> 970.639
get a little less air

973.68 --> 979.279
right okay so to report on some things

976.48 --> 983.839
that were happening yesterday

979.279 --> 983.8389999999999
like yeah i i kind of uh

983.92 --> 987.36
referenced the situation that happened

985.839 --> 990.399
yesterday morning

987.36 --> 992.399
and then on a friday as expected well

990.399 --> 993.68
not exactly in the way that it happened

992.399 --> 996.8
but

993.68 --> 998.079
yeah i popped over a gerund for just a

996.8 --> 1001.3599999999999
few secs

998.079 --> 1004.959
you know just to check him out because

1001.36 --> 1007.04
i mean no harm though i'm banned on this

1004.959 --> 1011.8389999999999
youtube channel apparently

1007.04 --> 1014.56
whatever but yeah listening in and

1011.839 --> 1014.5600000000001
yeah it was

1015.44 --> 1019.759
i don't know they were talking about

1016.88 --> 1024.24
more general subjects i guess

1019.759 --> 1027.76
mind control and corona and what

1024.24 --> 1027.76
did they bring in some

1031.039 --> 1035.28
i think they were at some point looking

1032.72 --> 1035.28
through some

1036.799 --> 1039.9189999999999
i think i remember hearing them talk

1039.439 --> 1042.559
about

1039.919 --> 1043.039
these supposed gateways that happen when

1042.559 --> 1045.36
you

1043.039 --> 1046.48
take ayahuasca in pyramids or something

1045.36 --> 1049.6789999999999
it sounds awful

1046.48 --> 1051.679
very fantastical but it

1049.679 --> 1053.039
i think i've heard that before it was

1051.679 --> 1056.48
quite fascinating

1053.039 --> 1059.6
you know it's sometimes they bring up

1056.48 --> 1063.28
really interesting stuff

1059.6 --> 1065.12
right but yeah they all also apparently

1063.28 --> 1066.3999999999999
thought it was necessarily without

1065.12 --> 1068.8799999999999
mentioning my name

1066.4 --> 1070.72
right but that doesn't really matter i

1068.88 --> 1075.6000000000001
think they were basically

1070.72 --> 1079.44
trying to tell me that yeah you don't

1075.6 --> 1082.48
you don't do what i did in that chat

1079.44 --> 1085.76
apparently it's a no-no-go

1082.48 --> 1095.2
zone and that was worth shaming well

1085.76 --> 1098.32
exactly like i expected

1095.2 --> 1098.32
so yeah

1098.72 --> 1103.28
it's disappointing but it's also exactly

1101.12 --> 1106.84
as expected

1103.28 --> 1108.6399999999999
and it's just goes to show that there is

1106.84 --> 1111.6789999999999
a

1108.64 --> 1115.8400000000001
a political camp going on effectively

1111.679 --> 1115.8400000000001
because of this kind of stuff and

1120.32 --> 1123.76
i'm gonna have to figure out how to deal

1122.0 --> 1127.12
with this

1123.76 --> 1127.12
because yeah i

1127.52 --> 1130.6399999999999
i don't [ __ ]

1130.799 --> 1136.48
you know very tolerant but i don't [ __ ]

1133.76 --> 1138.4
i can't do it

1136.48 --> 1139.679
but i don't like to be scared away

1138.4 --> 1143.6000000000001
especially

1139.679 --> 1146.0
when yeah when i'm a person that really

1143.6 --> 1148.24
is looking for yeah what is it

1146.0 --> 1151.76
companionship brothership

1148.24 --> 1154.16
you know and then when people are there

1151.76 --> 1155.12
that are just spouting certain type of

1154.16 --> 1158.0800000000002
things

1155.12 --> 1161.36
i have to stick up for certain people

1158.08 --> 1161.36
for what i know to be true

1161.44 --> 1166.799
and yeah

1165.039 --> 1168.4
if i'm gonna be sent away that's gonna

1166.799 --> 1170.799
make me feel like yeah

1168.4 --> 1172.48
it's not safe for me out here anymore i

1170.799 --> 1174.48
don't like that i

1172.48 --> 1176.799
makes me feel really miserable just

1174.48 --> 1179.84
going away to avoid

1176.799 --> 1179.84
a confrontation

1180.88 --> 1183.919
and hey i'm not the guy that will go two

1183.36 --> 1186.4799999999998
places

1183.919 --> 1187.5200000000002
just to poke people anymore like you

1186.48 --> 1191.76
know i'm not gonna go

1187.52 --> 1194.799
glow busters and then like stupid

1191.76 --> 1196.559
yeah no absolutely not and as hey as i

1194.799 --> 1198.48
said yesterday even on my show no

1196.559 --> 1201.28
mention of that

1198.48 --> 1203.84
i think that bob does have some

1201.28 --> 1206.3999999999999
interesting ideas

1203.84 --> 1207.52
that's like a real serious compliment

1206.4 --> 1211.2
okay don't say that

1207.52 --> 1214.559
lightly but it's just

1211.2 --> 1216.559
yeah well you know the rest

1214.559 --> 1217.84
and i wish him seriously the best of

1216.559 --> 1221.84
luck

1217.84 --> 1221.84
yeah you know

1227.6 --> 1235.84
yes yes it is nzt

1236.559 --> 1239.6
and it got kind of out of hand and i

1238.159 --> 1241.0390000000002
tried to explain that yesterday like i

1239.6 --> 1244.48
get

1241.039 --> 1244.48
i felt pretty shitty

1244.559 --> 1250.6399999999999
but like locked down in the morning then

1248.0 --> 1252.08
and yeah nath thompson was live and i

1250.64 --> 1255.6000000000001
was just like oh cool

1252.08 --> 1258.08
i do respect that guy a lot

1255.6 --> 1259.1999999999998
and maybe he can like inspire me out of

1258.08 --> 1260.96
this

1259.2 --> 1264.96
just feeling shitty for a moment and

1260.96 --> 1266.64
then another individual came in there

1264.96 --> 1268.159
or maybe he was there and i didn't see

1266.64 --> 1271.8400000000001
him before then

1268.159 --> 1277.2
and yeah that happened so it's just

1271.84 --> 1280.24
sucky for me

1277.2 --> 1284.0
and yeah i got a little mean

1280.24 --> 1285.2
i didn't like i don't know it's just the

1284.0 --> 1289.12
same level you know

1285.2 --> 1292.48
i did once i have that stick

1289.12 --> 1295.6789999999999
i don't change the stick

1292.48 --> 1297.3600000000001
like the stick the person specific type

1295.679 --> 1299.76
of stick you know

1297.36 --> 1300.4799999999998
the arguments i i try to kind of like

1299.76 --> 1302.96
bash them

1300.48 --> 1304.4
over the head with are just going to be

1302.96 --> 1307.52
those arguments

1304.4 --> 1310.3200000000002
that i know are right

1307.52 --> 1312.32
my weapon is truth literally that's what

1310.32 --> 1313.2
i try to do i don't adapt it i don't

1312.32 --> 1316.72
like

1313.2 --> 1319.8400000000001
let it grow out of hand gruesomely

1316.72 --> 1319.84
i don't do that

1323.52 --> 1325.9189999999999
anyway

1328.799 --> 1332.6399999999999
what nathan lost a bunch of subs from

1331.44 --> 1336.24
the gyro

1332.64 --> 1336.24
what what what do you mean

1337.039 --> 1342.32
i don't know but yeah look

1340.32 --> 1344.0
i'm kind of over it but yeah that was

1342.32 --> 1346.3999999999999
the situation yesterday

1344.0 --> 1348.48
and i was able to talk about it like

1346.4 --> 1350.24
including with good servant who's just a

1348.48 --> 1353.28
great guy

1350.24 --> 1356.4
he's a good friend and

1353.28 --> 1361.039
i know i'm a bit much sometimes but he's

1356.4 --> 1362.799
yeah he's

1361.039 --> 1366.799
being there for me and i really

1362.799 --> 1366.799
appreciate that in a very special way

1368.24 --> 1375.52
because he means it right and

1371.76 --> 1377.2
yeah i hope that it can like

1375.52 --> 1379.84
provide the same back when it's

1377.2 --> 1379.8400000000001
necessary

1381.2 --> 1385.919
anyway but yeah nathan which nathan

1384.88 --> 1389.679
nathan

1385.919 --> 1392.88
oakley or nathan thompson who are you

1389.679 --> 1392.88
talking about missouri bear

1400.84 --> 1407.039
oakley oh from the gyro

1404.08 --> 1407.039
i don't ever get it

1409.36 --> 1413.6789999999999
how can you lose subs from the gyro i

1412.159 --> 1416.48
don't understand what you're saying

1413.679 --> 1418.64
missouri bears

1416.48 --> 1419.919
yeah good servant is ace robin stanley

1418.64 --> 1424.0
indeed he is

1419.919 --> 1424.0
and a member one of the first

1426.77 --> 1432.799
[Music]

1429.44 --> 1436.72
oh yeah not not any criticism by the way

1432.799 --> 1436.72
on my part uh

1441.52 --> 1444.6399999999999
but i do recommend you become a member

1443.52 --> 1448.0
though

1444.64 --> 1448.3200000000002
just the minimum because yeah the more i

1448.0 --> 1450.559
see

1448.32 --> 1452.6399999999999
members also the more i will feel

1450.559 --> 1453.279
obligated to make these members only

1452.64 --> 1458.5590000000002
videos

1453.279 --> 1462.0
and i like doing it i think it's a

1458.559 --> 1464.6399999999999
i like the i like how this works

1462.0 --> 1466.4
it feels honest to me and i think i can

1464.64 --> 1469.76
muster it up

1466.4 --> 1469.76
does it make any sense guys

1469.919 --> 1475.279
i've been thinking a lot about

1473.2 --> 1476.96
what businesses and business plans

1475.279 --> 1479.6
really are

1476.96 --> 1482.24
in the energy exchange and like the

1479.6 --> 1485.52
deeper ethereal structures behind it

1482.24 --> 1488.799
and where i objected so heavily before

1485.52 --> 1490.1589999999999
for ethereal reasons and that like yeah

1488.799 --> 1491.039
how are you gonna explain that to the

1490.159 --> 1494.24
world why you're

1491.039 --> 1496.96
not doing it it just makes

1494.24 --> 1498.08
people will see it and just be like why

1496.96 --> 1500.32
it's a waste

1498.08 --> 1501.6789999999999
but then i try to explain it and then

1500.32 --> 1505.2
afterward it's like

1501.679 --> 1508.799
ah but what do i do

1505.2 --> 1510.96
instead and that situation has been kind

1508.799 --> 1514.8799999999999
of been repeating for a long time and

1510.96 --> 1517.6000000000001
and i found myself here

1514.88 --> 1520.3200000000002
in a way doing this youtube feels like

1517.6 --> 1520.32
my first

1521.039 --> 1524.24
like real attempt

1524.32 --> 1530.32
and success i think it's a success i

1526.88 --> 1532.7990000000002
consider my youtube channel a success

1530.32 --> 1533.52
also thanks to all this very loyal

1532.799 --> 1536.4
support

1533.52 --> 1537.279
and like when i compare it with other

1536.4 --> 1541.2
channels

1537.279 --> 1544.799
yeah you know

1541.2 --> 1549.2
i feel some really core support here

1544.799 --> 1553.84
and that that's very inspiring and

1549.2 --> 1553.8400000000001
i wish to understand more also

1555.6 --> 1561.12
also as to why like who am i in

1559.44 --> 1563.2
opposition to other people what are

1561.12 --> 1566.4799999999998
other people doing

1563.2 --> 1569.2
like with their businessmen

1566.48 --> 1571.279
on youtube or on the internet like how

1569.2 --> 1575.3600000000001
does that work how

1571.279 --> 1575.679
how do they also live beside that now

1575.36 --> 1578.08
not

1575.679 --> 1579.1200000000001
that i'm looking for other channels to

1578.08 --> 1582.24
do all that

1579.12 --> 1586.9599999999998
and just share everything

1582.24 --> 1590.4
but i'm always curious because for me

1586.96 --> 1592.08
figuring out how to build my life

1590.4 --> 1594.0
it's like one of the most complicated

1592.08 --> 1597.52
things ever

1594.0 --> 1599.52
basically because of the kind of the

1597.52 --> 1601.12
things that i'm trying to maintain that

1599.52 --> 1603.36
make it very difficult

1601.12 --> 1604.3999999999999
and at the same time inner conflicts

1603.36 --> 1606.4799999999998
that i've resolved

1604.4 --> 1608.0800000000002
or have to resolve that also make it

1606.48 --> 1610.159
very difficult

1608.08 --> 1612.559
i'm betting on that i'll be able to

1610.159 --> 1616.24
resolve the conflicts

1612.559 --> 1618.799
and then still be able to integrate

1616.24 --> 1621.039
with the important choices that i have

1618.799 --> 1624.1589999999999
made and stuck to

1621.039 --> 1628.48
that's that's my long-term

1624.159 --> 1628.48
personal business and spirit plan

1633.36 --> 1637.52
yeah how do you guys by the way like my

1638.84 --> 1644.76
uh

1640.48 --> 1648.72
my hangout yesterday talking about

1644.76 --> 1651.279
falsification of

1648.72 --> 1652.08
aspects of the realm orientation and

1651.279 --> 1655.279
elements

1652.08 --> 1658.72
i was really proud of what i put down

1655.279 --> 1658.72
like i put it down really well

1658.88 --> 1664.3990000000001
i really felt like yeah this is proper

1662.08 --> 1666.1589999999999
official cosmogeny science

1664.399 --> 1669.84
representation

1666.159 --> 1669.8400000000001
i was very proud of that

1674.399 --> 1681.6
i'm getting good at it and i'm also like

1678.799 --> 1683.6
with the strictness and rigidity i'm now

1681.6 --> 1686.1589999999999
able to like kind of

1683.6 --> 1687.4399999999998
weave my own pattern within those

1686.159 --> 1689.5200000000002
confined

1687.44 --> 1690.48
structures and put down a good

1689.52 --> 1693.76
consistent

1690.48 --> 1696.799
thing i like it it's i

1693.76 --> 1698.72
i feel very confident

1696.799 --> 1700.559
in what i'm doing and also because i'm

1698.72 --> 1703.039
not overreaching

1700.559 --> 1705.279
that's like the critical like good you

1703.039 --> 1706.399
know you know how far my fantasy can

1705.279 --> 1708.24
reach

1706.399 --> 1711.4399999999998
especially when it comes to the

1708.24 --> 1715.279
discipline of presuppositions

1711.44 --> 1718.88
but there really is level

1715.279 --> 1721.919
i i keep it very tight very very tight

1718.88 --> 1723.3600000000001
like punishing anyway and there's plenty

1721.919 --> 1726.88
of people out there that are just

1723.36 --> 1729.76
not willing to go there

1726.88 --> 1731.2
there's very few people because for

1729.76 --> 1734.24
those that have a wide

1731.2 --> 1738.0800000000002
fantasy range in mind it just

1734.24 --> 1739.84
seems like it's taking away their

1738.08 --> 1741.6789999999999
freedom to imagine

1739.84 --> 1743.1999999999998
and dream and believe in that

1741.679 --> 1746.24
imagination

1743.2 --> 1746.24
as much as they like

1749.44 --> 1756.3990000000001
instead of utilizing it taming it

1754.0 --> 1757.84
to get a better grip on the world and

1756.399 --> 1761.4399999999998
assist

1757.84 --> 1764.799
other people

1761.44 --> 1767.679
that are lost handing out

1764.799 --> 1769.679
information tools virtual tools that

1767.679 --> 1772.24
literally people by watching

1769.679 --> 1774.159
and getting hooked in some way getting

1772.24 --> 1776.48
touched

1774.159 --> 1778.159
can make the choice to literally copy

1776.48 --> 1783.3600000000001
paste it

1778.159 --> 1785.919
make it their own that's what you can do

1783.36 --> 1786.8799999999999
when you put those supposed those

1785.919 --> 1790.48
feeling wise

1786.88 --> 1791.7600000000002
shackles on the imagination

1790.48 --> 1793.679
and that doesn't mean that you can't

1791.76 --> 1796.32
imagine it's just that

1793.679 --> 1798.3990000000001
it it's only allowed under certain

1796.32 --> 1801.52
conditions

1798.399 --> 1803.76
yeah it's like taping a beast putting a

1801.52 --> 1806.559
saddle on it

1803.76 --> 1806.559
something like that

1806.96 --> 1811.44
and then suddenly instead of just having

1809.44 --> 1814.3990000000001
this marvelous beast to behold

1811.44 --> 1818.3200000000002
all the time and to inspire you you got

1814.399 --> 1818.32
for example a riding animal or

1822.159 --> 1826.7990000000002
big beast that could drag something you

1824.159 --> 1830.88
know they could actually

1826.799 --> 1835.039
create change in the physical world

1830.88 --> 1835.0390000000002
and that's part of my mission

1835.44 --> 1842.0
because a lot of my life really here

1839.12 --> 1843.6
it felt because of the way things are

1842.0 --> 1847.12
that my imagination

1843.6 --> 1848.8799999999999
is just a curse that my intelligence

1847.12 --> 1850.7199999999998
and my imagination that are well

1848.88 --> 1854.48
integrated or is a curse

1850.72 --> 1857.6000000000001
because of all the traps out there

1854.48 --> 1858.559
and the more you start to drown in your

1857.6 --> 1861.519
imagination

1858.559 --> 1863.6
the easier that you fall into the traps

1861.519 --> 1865.76
and it gets really bad

1863.6 --> 1867.84
and that just made me feel like i was a

1865.76 --> 1872.24
cursed

1867.84 --> 1874.8799999999999
creature in a world that was only traps

1872.24 --> 1876.32
only traps made me feel like a yeah

1874.88 --> 1879.679
paranoid little mouse

1876.32 --> 1881.519
weirdly enough

1879.679 --> 1882.88
and that kind of thing has a like a

1881.519 --> 1886.0
visual visceral

1882.88 --> 1893.8400000000001
impact on your entire being for

1886.0 --> 1893.84
periods of times my teens

1896.48 --> 1901.919
i spent time almost trying to deactivate

1901.12 --> 1904.6399999999999
it

1901.919 --> 1906.0800000000002
can you imagine that because i wanted to

1904.64 --> 1908.96
fit in so bad

1906.08 --> 1910.559
i would literally try to df in the

1908.96 --> 1913.679
activate

1910.559 --> 1917.2
the fantastical inside impulses

1913.679 --> 1920.799
just to not be

1917.2 --> 1922.96
seen as extreme

1920.799 --> 1924.6399999999999
not scary and then just yeah they go

1922.96 --> 1928.72
along it's it was so

1924.64 --> 1928.72
punishing of me to do that

1929.6 --> 1934.399
it's like all this light i have to kill

1931.44 --> 1936.3200000000002
off this is

1934.399 --> 1938.399
so yeah that turned out not to be worth

1936.32 --> 1949.84
it after several

1938.399 --> 1949.84
trials over my lifetime

1951.919 --> 1955.44
and yeah that's also the reason weirdly

1954.32 --> 1960.08
enough

1955.44 --> 1960.0800000000002
as i grow older i find myself to become

1960.84 --> 1966.559
almost

1963.72 --> 1968.96
ideologically egocentric

1966.559 --> 1970.8799999999999
that sounds really bad any word ego

1968.96 --> 1974.159
related sounds bad

1970.88 --> 1976.3200000000002
but it's not like it's not the ego

1974.159 --> 1980.48
taking control it's just that

1976.32 --> 1983.12
i can't allow my identity

1980.48 --> 1984.0
to become part of anything that's out

1983.12 --> 1987.36
there

1984.0 --> 1990.64
like for real not an individual

1987.36 --> 1994.0
not a group not a friend i

1990.64 --> 1997.519
always have to be absolutely

1994.0 --> 1998.32
only me this is yeah talk about another

1997.519 --> 2002.84
discipline

1998.32 --> 2005.2
holy [ __ ] because i'm so used to just

2002.84 --> 2009.039
merging that's what i did

2005.2 --> 2011.679
as a kid it's just like meet somebody

2009.039 --> 2013.36
they hear them out and it's like wow i

2011.679 --> 2016.799
completely get you

2013.36 --> 2018.0
look here are all the ideas you haven't

2016.799 --> 2020.08
thought of yet that are

2018.0 --> 2021.919
exactly what you were looking for that's

2020.08 --> 2025.12
[ __ ]

2021.919 --> 2027.919
you know just spirit merger just like

2025.12 --> 2028.8799999999999
oh this is who you are i can help you

2027.919 --> 2032.24
with that

2028.88 --> 2035.679
bang crazy

2032.24 --> 2038.96
the world is not suitable

2035.679 --> 2047.8400000000001
for a person like that

2038.96 --> 2047.8400000000001
it is still part of me

2050.72 --> 2055.1189999999997
because yeah people don't often don't

2053.76 --> 2060.8
want to be helped you have to wait for

2055.119 --> 2064.32
the right moment

2060.8 --> 2068.96
when they will recognize

2064.32 --> 2073.119
that you have the solution for once

2068.96 --> 2075.679
and then then you can give it to them

2073.119 --> 2078.159
does that make any sense because if

2075.679 --> 2079.76
you're just a random person to them

2078.159 --> 2081.44
and you're going to hand them like

2079.76 --> 2083.28
critical impacted

2081.44 --> 2084.879
detailed information they're not going

2083.28 --> 2086.079
to be attuned they're not going to hear

2084.879 --> 2089.1189999999997
it even probably it's

2086.079 --> 2091.3590000000004
it's going to fluster them or their ego

2089.119 --> 2093.04
is gonna like quickly defend and see

2091.359 --> 2094.3199999999997
some kind of preconception of the way

2093.04 --> 2096.56
you look

2094.32 --> 2098.88
and then cross-reference it with some

2096.56 --> 2101.2799999999997
potential political manipulation

2098.88 --> 2102.0
maybe you know that's very easy to jump

2101.28 --> 2106.2400000000002
to mind these

2102.0 --> 2109.92
days so no

2106.24 --> 2112.16
doesn't work anymore not not exactly

2109.92 --> 2114.8
that you know there's some people that

2112.16 --> 2119.2799999999997
find sophisticated ways through this

2114.8 --> 2121.92
these effects but for me no

2119.28 --> 2122.48
people have to get to know me and then

2121.92 --> 2126.56
when

2122.48 --> 2128.079
they see i have the solution to their

2126.56 --> 2131.04
problem

2128.079 --> 2132.5600000000004
then they come to me or i bump into them

2131.04 --> 2135.92
something happens

2132.56 --> 2137.68
and then i blurt it out without even it

2135.92 --> 2141.2000000000003
being a big deal to me

2137.68 --> 2145.839
and then it works and that seems to be

2141.2 --> 2145.839
the way it's supposed to happen

2149.34 --> 2152.619
[Music]

2156.839 --> 2159.839
right

2170.839 --> 2173.839
hey

2174.56 --> 2178.24
multi-field completely oblivious uh yeah

2176.96 --> 2180.7200000000003
yeah

2178.24 --> 2182.8799999999997
yeah hiding under the veils right

2180.72 --> 2186.24
missouri bear

2182.88 --> 2187.76
yeah oh there's plenty of that you know

2186.24 --> 2191.5989999999997
society is

2187.76 --> 2193.3590000000004
arranged to account

2191.599 --> 2195.76
for people to be able to do that

2193.359 --> 2199.5989999999997
specifically it's like tinkertail that's

2195.76 --> 2203.119
what it's designed for for people

2199.599 --> 2204.1600000000003
that use narratives that use things to

2203.119 --> 2206.48
hide under

2204.16 --> 2207.44
and then people just go around covered

2206.48 --> 2210.8
in veils

2207.44 --> 2215.839
and whatever image fits

2210.8 --> 2215.8390000000004
to a specific veil they will apply

2235.44 --> 2246.16
no you're not new joseph

2243.28 --> 2246.1600000000003
but good morning

2254.079 --> 2258.0
oh right another thing that happened

2255.76 --> 2259.599
yesterday that was weird

2258.0 --> 2261.119
it was in the middle of when i was

2259.599 --> 2263.92
watching um benjamin even

2261.119 --> 2266.7200000000003
kind of annoying but some person called

2263.92 --> 2269.6800000000003
me up on the phone

2266.72 --> 2271.5989999999997
for uh what is it statistical research

2269.68 --> 2274.56
worldwide

2271.599 --> 2276.96
and they were asking me questions and i

2274.56 --> 2281.119
thought like oh dear

2276.96 --> 2283.359
this is probably going to be problematic

2281.119 --> 2284.96
and yeah it kind of turned out to be

2283.359 --> 2288.4
exactly that

2284.96 --> 2290.4
because like everything

2288.4 --> 2292.4
that they asked about was just highly

2290.4 --> 2294.48
controversial and politicized but they

2292.4 --> 2295.359
didn't even like fill it in it's just

2294.48 --> 2298.2400000000002
like

2295.359 --> 2299.2
okay what do you think about this

2298.24 --> 2302.0789999999997
president

2299.2 --> 2304.7999999999997
and yeah trump was also mentioned but

2302.079 --> 2308.0
multiple people

2304.8 --> 2310.7200000000003
and then just like rate them and then

2308.0 --> 2313.119
i would ask like on what sorry the

2310.72 --> 2315.2
question does not

2313.119 --> 2316.7200000000003
fill that in you just have to answer it

2315.2 --> 2319.839
like

2316.72 --> 2323.9199999999996
really it's uh that felt like that this

2319.839 --> 2324.7999999999997
is freaky like there should be more

2323.92 --> 2328.079
detail if this is

2324.8 --> 2331.119
actually data analysis there should be

2328.079 --> 2333.8390000000004
context options but

2331.119 --> 2335.44
they they left it out a lot but they'd

2333.839 --> 2336.24
filled it in nonetheless and they put

2335.44 --> 2341.839
down a pretty

2336.24 --> 2341.839
odd picture to them

2342.0 --> 2347.599
like by looking back at it

2345.76 --> 2349.599
like the way i answered and balance

2347.599 --> 2351.599
things out

2349.599 --> 2353.3590000000004
it's probably gonna be pretty tough for

2351.599 --> 2358.48
them to get a read

2353.359 --> 2358.48
on me with that

2358.64 --> 2362.0
but it i did everything honestly i had

2361.68 --> 2365.359
to

2362.0 --> 2367.52
intuitively just decide like

2365.359 --> 2370.0
okay i haven't looked into that guy for

2367.52 --> 2372.56
like 10 years

2370.0 --> 2373.2
but as far as i vaguely remember it's

2372.56 --> 2376.24
like this

2373.2 --> 2376.24
right that [ __ ]

2381.28 --> 2385.92
well ryan eartherton i even very made it

2384.32 --> 2389.119
very apparent

2385.92 --> 2391.6800000000003
that i did not believe the corona

2389.119 --> 2392.8
situation and they asked about it

2391.68 --> 2395.1189999999997
specifically

2392.8 --> 2396.88
like what do you think the corona threat

2395.119 --> 2398.7200000000003
is going to be

2396.88 --> 2400.56
in europe and what do you think it's

2398.72 --> 2403.68
going to be

2400.56 --> 2405.2799999999997
in your country and like that type of

2403.68 --> 2408.56
questions and it was like

2405.28 --> 2412.4
what medical threat zero zero zero like

2408.56 --> 2415.68
no there is no infectious disease threat

2412.4 --> 2419.6800000000003
none zero zero zero

2415.68 --> 2419.68
every time it's just like no no

2421.52 --> 2427.44
so that was blatantly obvious to them

2426.079 --> 2429.8390000000004
but they also asked like you're

2427.44 --> 2433.28
political people what like how do

2429.839 --> 2433.2799999999997
what do you think of jiji ping

2433.44 --> 2439.68
the [ __ ] i don't know

2436.88 --> 2440.319
i'm not really all that aware as to like

2439.68 --> 2443.5989999999997
how he's

2440.319 --> 2445.68
actually managing china itself

2443.599 --> 2446.96
like is he even doing that or is he just

2445.68 --> 2450.64
a puppet

2446.96 --> 2452.7200000000003
you know so that but yeah there was no

2450.64 --> 2453.359
room for me to even put that context in

2452.72 --> 2455.359
the question

2453.359 --> 2457.52
the lady it was a lady even got it kind

2455.359 --> 2460.319
of impatient with me eventually

2457.52 --> 2461.44
because i kept on putting contacts to

2460.319 --> 2464.4
things it's like yeah

2461.44 --> 2465.599
this yeah just please just answer the

2464.4 --> 2468.8
questions

2465.599 --> 2468.8
like this is annoying

2468.96 --> 2474.2400000000002
but i finished it eventually and yeah

2471.839 --> 2481.359
that's going around apparently

2474.24 --> 2495.839
randomly selected phone number sure

2481.359 --> 2495.839
so that happened yesterday too

2510.319 --> 2523.839
what are you talking about

2525.44 --> 2531.44
oh and by the way i have actually been

2528.96 --> 2532.56
tapping into watching dutch news again

2531.44 --> 2536.4
it seems to be

2532.56 --> 2540.16
just corona it's now i'd say

2536.4 --> 2543.04
80 percent corona like 80

2540.16 --> 2545.52
like if they they do it like this either

2543.04 --> 2547.359
it is purely about corona room

2545.52 --> 2549.28
with the developments in what they're

2547.359 --> 2552.16
going to do now or

2549.28 --> 2553.3590000000004
new statistics from this country like

2552.16 --> 2556.24
pure corona

2553.359 --> 2557.119
or it's like oh this person how are they

2556.24 --> 2560.0
affected

2557.119 --> 2565.839
after guru it's like every [ __ ] thing

2560.0 --> 2565.839
is just

2566.079 --> 2571.6800000000003
and like even when it's completely not

2569.359 --> 2574.7999999999997
corona

2571.68 --> 2574.7999999999997
it's just something else

2575.119 --> 2582.56
then even at times

2579.44 --> 2585.76
somebody will bring it up

2582.56 --> 2588.7999999999997
if it's like in more recently made

2585.76 --> 2593.3590000000004
somebody will bring it up there's just

2588.8 --> 2596.1600000000003
no escape from it

2593.359 --> 2598.4
but yeah the news is just pumping it

2596.16 --> 2600.24
like crazy

2598.4 --> 2602.96
because everybody's making but these

2600.24 --> 2605.839
stories about oh my god i have

2602.96 --> 2607.68
i've had corona and i'm afraid of the

2605.839 --> 2612.24
secondary hit

2607.68 --> 2615.1189999999997
and oh jesus

2612.24 --> 2615.1189999999997
like for real

2615.68 --> 2619.2799999999997
like these people are like

2619.44 --> 2623.76
they do they really think that

2623.839 --> 2629.52
it seemed like they actually believed it

2626.96 --> 2632.079
they were just indoctrinated by

2629.52 --> 2635.04
everybody and

2632.079 --> 2635.3590000000004
just took on this complex like oh my god

2635.04 --> 2638.319
i

2635.359 --> 2640.24
have corona symptoms and i don't

2638.319 --> 2642.88
understand what's going on why is it

2640.24 --> 2642.8799999999997
coming back

2648.56 --> 2650.7999999999997
it

2656.56 --> 2660.0789999999997
yeah it's just that

2660.88 --> 2664.1600000000003
let's not score too much about it but

2663.359 --> 2666.7999999999997
like

2664.16 --> 2668.8799999999997
i knew things got bad like out there

2666.8 --> 2669.52
from hearing everybody even reference it

2668.88 --> 2671.52
right

2669.52 --> 2674.4
and they know like yes union is going to

2671.52 --> 2677.359
be absolutely abysmally terrible

2674.4 --> 2677.839
right but yeah the netherlands typically

2677.359 --> 2681.04
kind of

2677.839 --> 2684.72
follows that sort of

2681.04 --> 2684.72
top liberals but

2686.079 --> 2690.6400000000003
knowing it that it's absolutely

2688.319 --> 2692.64
inevitable that it is that way and then

2690.64 --> 2696.0
actually just watching it

2692.64 --> 2699.5989999999997
for a time like really soaking up the

2696.0 --> 2699.599
real thing and it's just like

2702.839 --> 2708.4
damn

2705.359 --> 2711.7599999999998
they're this is so

2708.4 --> 2715.599
heavy on people's minds it's like

2711.76 --> 2718.1600000000003
they can't escape unless they're like

2715.599 --> 2719.839
trained against it and the only way yeah

2718.16 --> 2722.0
well you can do that stepping away but

2719.839 --> 2724.24
just like there's no escape

2722.0 --> 2725.24
it's so heavy on the pressure it's like

2724.24 --> 2728.72
literally

2725.24 --> 2730.9599999999996
programming like this

2728.72 --> 2733.7599999999998
is what you're going to preoccupy

2730.96 --> 2736.0
yourself with from now on

2733.76 --> 2737.6800000000003
every day every day this is the only

2736.0 --> 2740.0
thing that matters now every day every

2737.68 --> 2740.0
day it's

2745.839 --> 2751.359
it's like there must be some serious

2748.4 --> 2754.7200000000003
mental problems out there

2751.359 --> 2757.04
because of all this i hope

2754.72 --> 2760.0
enough people realize like yeah you got

2757.04 --> 2762.88
to get away from the television

2760.0 --> 2762.88
with this stuff

2763.44 --> 2768.64
you know back in the day in a way for

2766.079 --> 2771.28
example when a war broke out

2768.64 --> 2773.44
even after 9 11 i would kind of like be

2771.28 --> 2774.96
indoctrinated or yeah indoctrinated

2773.44 --> 2776.64
i would be fascinated with the

2774.96 --> 2778.56
television see i'll go what are they

2776.64 --> 2779.52
going to do now or what's the situation

2778.56 --> 2783.359
who's going to win

2779.52 --> 2783.359
more blah blah blah i don't know i guess

2784.319 --> 2788.0
i'm a boy or something this is just too

2787.359 --> 2790.96
many video

2788.0 --> 2791.359
games i don't know what that is but with

2790.96 --> 2794.64
this

2791.359 --> 2797.92
it's just oh my god

2794.64 --> 2799.1189999999997
i'm so lucky that i'm not a germophobe

2797.92 --> 2802.4
anymore

2799.119 --> 2802.96
so lucky because if i would have still

2802.4 --> 2806.4
been that

2802.96 --> 2810.0
and i were at a time if i still would

2806.4 --> 2810.0
have been i don't know

2811.119 --> 2814.2400000000002
where i would be now

2814.56 --> 2819.52
i'd i'd probably be i don't even want to

2818.24 --> 2822.24
say it i'd be so

2819.52 --> 2823.839
stressed out i'd be just freaking an

2822.24 --> 2825.839
idiot with a mask

2823.839 --> 2827.52
and just like thinking about the end of

2825.839 --> 2831.839
the world all day long

2827.52 --> 2831.839
it's just what the [ __ ]

2832.96 --> 2837.44
i'm so glad i figured that out i figured

2836.64 --> 2840.5589999999997
out

2837.44 --> 2843.76
alternative medicine early on and took

2840.559 --> 2844.079
the extra steps on the way where my dad

2843.76 --> 2847.2000000000003
went

2844.079 --> 2848.88
also because it's really my dad that

2847.2 --> 2850.319
that really pushed the german new

2848.88 --> 2854.2400000000002
medicine onto me

2850.319 --> 2857.119
that kind of like told me like no

2854.24 --> 2859.5989999999997
you really must do this despite it

2857.119 --> 2862.88
seeming so awkward

2859.599 --> 2863.52
and i was like oh [ __ ] well okay if my

2862.88 --> 2866.6400000000003
dad

2863.52 --> 2869.68
really believes in this and he's

2866.64 --> 2872.16
really studying into that i

2869.68 --> 2873.9199999999996
i gotta push myself to really take that

2872.16 --> 2876.5589999999997
serious for a moment and and

2873.92 --> 2877.28
get a feel for it and i'm so glad that i

2876.559 --> 2879.0400000000004
did

2877.28 --> 2880.48
and then when that sinks in and when

2879.04 --> 2884.079
your body starts to

2880.48 --> 2886.2400000000002
adapt to that other perception

2884.079 --> 2887.76
because psychosomatic energies and all

2886.24 --> 2890.24
that

2887.76 --> 2890.2400000000002
sadly

2891.839 --> 2895.68
it's only psychological

2895.839 --> 2900.0789999999997
indoctrination that's the only thing

2897.359 --> 2902.319
that's left now that i'm confronted with

2900.079 --> 2903.119
because it's not getting in my body it's

2902.319 --> 2906.4
like a lit

2903.119 --> 2907.119
it doesn't matter they could literally

2906.4 --> 2909.599
just say

2907.119 --> 2910.6400000000003
oh we're gonna we're spraying you now

2909.599 --> 2914.4
with

2910.64 --> 2917.1189999999997
oh the corona blah

2914.4 --> 2917.76
like virus as extracts like you know

2917.119 --> 2921.2000000000003
like

2917.76 --> 2924.559
i i don't care

2921.2 --> 2924.5589999999997
i'm not gonna get it

2924.72 --> 2931.9199999999996
i'm just not

2928.4 --> 2935.28
and even if i would it would be

2931.92 --> 2937.28
like out of my system again very quickly

2935.28 --> 2938.6400000000003
the only thing that's required is for

2937.28 --> 2941.119
all these freaking

2938.64 --> 2942.0789999999997
corona indoctrinated people to get the

2941.119 --> 2945.28
[ __ ] away

2942.079 --> 2947.3590000000004
from me let me just have some peace and

2945.28 --> 2950.0
quiet a good shower and [ __ ]

2947.359 --> 2951.5989999999997
get the the right supplements good rest

2950.0 --> 2954.319
maybe some chicken soup

2951.599 --> 2955.04
as i prescribed very long ago when all

2954.319 --> 2957.2799999999997
this

2955.04 --> 2959.68
nonsense started up months ago remember

2957.28 --> 2962.2400000000002
that's my that was my advice

2959.68 --> 2964.72
that's what i do and it'd be over in a

2962.24 --> 2968.3999999999996
day probably

2964.72 --> 2972.16
that's it because it's not

2968.4 --> 2973.04
what they say it is that's not how it

2972.16 --> 2975.5989999999997
works

2973.04 --> 2977.359
we've seen plenty of testimony and

2975.599 --> 2980.1600000000003
presentations about it from

2977.359 --> 2980.16
medical people

2981.119 --> 2989.44
the what is it

2985.04 --> 2993.2
the environment theory versus

2989.44 --> 2997.04
germ theory right i thought that was a

2993.2 --> 2999.839
a great system it's a great way to

2997.04 --> 2999.839
explain it

3000.0 --> 3004.0
so yeah even that information is is out

3002.319 --> 3006.96
there it has been open

3004.0 --> 3006.96
has been shown

3007.839 --> 3012.93
and that's what i do i literally

3011.2 --> 3016.31
don't believe it

3012.93 --> 3016.31
[Music]

3016.4 --> 3018.64
right

3022.24 --> 3026.319
and that doesn't mean that i want old

3024.48 --> 3028.2400000000002
people to die by the way

3026.319 --> 3030.64
just just on the record i don't like

3028.24 --> 3034.72
that at all

3030.64 --> 3038.7999999999997
i think most old people would probably

3034.72 --> 3038.7999999999997
live a lot better and a lot longer

3039.52 --> 3046.72
if i don't know their kids

3043.28 --> 3046.96
took care of them maybe at least as far

3046.72 --> 3049.359
as

3046.96 --> 3049.359
needed

3051.76 --> 3056.1600000000003
and there's probably still plenty of

3054.48 --> 3058.8
families out there that do

3056.16 --> 3060.8799999999997
you know especially from certain

3058.8 --> 3063.76
traditions

3060.88 --> 3066.0
but yeah that's really the problem in my

3063.76 --> 3070.3190000000004
opinion

3066.0 --> 3070.319
that's really what's causing the issues

3073.359 --> 3077.839
not any supposed virus going around it's

3076.16 --> 3083.2799999999997
just the recklessness

3077.839 --> 3085.44
carelessness and

3083.28 --> 3087.28
and yeah they're in the way they're in

3085.44 --> 3090.88
the way of that they're just

3087.28 --> 3097.119
the front line victims

3090.88 --> 3100.079
of the hysteria

3097.119 --> 3100.7200000000003
but if you protect your parents very

3100.079 --> 3102.559
carefully

3100.72 --> 3105.359
if you don't allow them to be

3102.559 --> 3109.2000000000003
indoctrinated

3105.359 --> 3110.319
so they know like this is an assault by

3109.2 --> 3114.16
the beast

3110.319 --> 3116.72
on your age please be strong for us we

3114.16 --> 3117.68
want you to pull through this the only

3116.72 --> 3124.5589999999997
way you could do this

3117.68 --> 3126.96
is by not believing them

3124.559 --> 3128.6400000000003
and stay close to us you know that

3126.96 --> 3131.28
that's

3128.64 --> 3132.64
that's really that's how he that's how i

3131.28 --> 3135.44
would do it

3132.64 --> 3138.64
and i'm keeping a close watch on my dad

3135.44 --> 3141.04
in a way

3138.64 --> 3142.48
now he's not going to be fooled but i'm

3141.04 --> 3145.7599999999998
like ready to

3142.48 --> 3146.96
yeah do whatever is necessary to protect

3145.76 --> 3149.92
him i guess

3146.96 --> 3151.04
as far as i can i don't know if yeah but

3149.92 --> 3155.599
that's my feel

3151.04 --> 3155.599
that that's my response to the situation

3163.119 --> 3167.839
oh really michael

3174.24 --> 3176.8799999999997
okay

3177.52 --> 3184.16
all right

3180.64 --> 3184.16
yeah there's no place for uh

3184.319 --> 3191.44
idiots that don't

3187.68 --> 3194.16
even listen to what's talked about

3191.44 --> 3196.0
now dank yeah but he's just he literally

3194.16 --> 3197.68
just came in he wasn't even listening to

3196.0 --> 3201.44
what i said and he just

3197.68 --> 3204.96
blurted out a standard global

3201.44 --> 3209.839
prodding tool it's just really dumb

3204.96 --> 3209.839
so just get out get out you dumbass

3210.24 --> 3213.839
this is not even the subject right now

3212.4 --> 3216.96
although it could be you know

3213.839 --> 3223.839
could just talk about flat earth again

3216.96 --> 3223.839
because they like it so much

3242.88 --> 3245.2000000000003
hmm

3249.2 --> 3254.48
bailey's oh god really

3257.2 --> 3265.839
some bad experience with that stuff

3268.16 --> 3279.839
like don't combine it with seven up

3271.76 --> 3279.8390000000004
for sure

3290.319 --> 3296.48
hmm yeah robin stanley it yeah it is

3293.599 --> 3299.76
going to be challenging

3296.48 --> 3299.76
and also in a way

3299.92 --> 3305.04
to do it properly you got to kind of

3302.24 --> 3308.16
have a bigger family

3305.04 --> 3310.4
you will need more people if you just

3308.16 --> 3311.44
have a very small family then taking

3310.4 --> 3313.52
care of

3311.44 --> 3315.2000000000003
granny or granddad is just more

3313.52 --> 3318.88
difficult because you don't

3315.2 --> 3323.04
you only have so many people to

3318.88 --> 3323.04
jump in and do something you know

3324.96 --> 3328.7200000000003
unless you have like a yeah friend

3327.839 --> 3331.119
circle or

3328.72 --> 3332.3999999999996
like really good neighborhood ties and

3331.119 --> 3334.2400000000002
then they might

3332.4 --> 3337.119
jump in but yeah you gotta have that

3334.24 --> 3337.1189999999997
bond then

3338.0 --> 3342.079
it's kind of funny remembering back

3342.88 --> 3346.48
when you're still very very young like

3345.04 --> 3348.4
before five

3346.48 --> 3349.76
my parents lived like in a specific

3348.4 --> 3352.64
neighborhood

3349.76 --> 3354.4
where everybody was like really it was

3352.64 --> 3357.92
like a a village

3354.4 --> 3359.599
in the middle of a city almost it was a

3357.92 --> 3361.6800000000003
where just everybody really got to know

3359.599 --> 3362.7200000000003
each other it was a bit hippie-ish and

3361.68 --> 3365.9199999999996
stuff

3362.72 --> 3368.8799999999997
but that worked because yeah everybody

3365.92 --> 3371.599
really what was supposed to be there for

3368.88 --> 3373.839
one another like it's your duty

3371.599 --> 3374.6400000000003
and that that worked out for my parents

3373.839 --> 3377.839
back then but

3374.64 --> 3377.839
eventually they moved out

3378.72 --> 3383.359
to yeah where i lived most of my life

3384.319 --> 3392.96
and then that yeah

3387.359 --> 3392.96
there wasn't that much of that anymore

3394.16 --> 3399.1189999999997
like we we kind of got to know our

3396.48 --> 3402.799
neighbors but not too many

3399.119 --> 3405.119
over long times and and like there were

3402.799 --> 3406.57
conflicts and stuff there were a lot of

3405.119 --> 3408.0
like neighbors that were eating

3406.57 --> 3411.04
[Music]

3408.0 --> 3411.04
yeah that was annoying

3411.599 --> 3417.3590000000004
but yeah

3415.28 --> 3418.4
in these type of situations you really

3417.359 --> 3422.0
need like

3418.4 --> 3425.2000000000003
a group or a family or something

3422.0 --> 3425.2
to help take care of

3430.839 --> 3433.839
business

3441.2 --> 3443.4399999999996
oh

3444.319 --> 3461.839
oh that sounds terrible robin stanley

3471.24 --> 3475.839
[Music]

3472.839 --> 3475.839
hmm

3486.799 --> 3489.839
i think

3490.24 --> 3494.3999999999996
yeah well i'm going for a period of wine

3500.839 --> 3503.839
myself

3516.96 --> 3519.2
whoa

3524.4 --> 3527.76
i'm sorry to hear that eyes wide shut

3526.319 --> 3531.7599999999998
that's

3527.76 --> 3534.1600000000003
wow that's a long period to fight that

3531.76 --> 3534.1600000000003
ms

3541.68 --> 3545.9199999999996
you wanted to be part of a drug trail

3543.92 --> 3550.2400000000002
and was refused

3545.92 --> 3552.7200000000003
oh yeah breaking in the spirit you know

3550.24 --> 3555.2799999999997
like especially but that's kind of

3552.72 --> 3555.2799999999997
that's really

3555.44 --> 3561.2000000000003
it's tough a way like cancer

3558.559 --> 3562.1600000000003
is if you look into germinal medicine

3561.2 --> 3564.319
really

3562.16 --> 3566.0
it is directly tied into that type of

3564.319 --> 3569.52
thing

3566.0 --> 3571.52
it even has to do with emotions so yeah

3569.52 --> 3573.7599999999998
breaking the spirit

3571.52 --> 3574.72
when they're for in a fragile moment

3573.76 --> 3580.079
yeah it can be

3574.72 --> 3580.0789999999997
lethal with cantor situations

3583.76 --> 3587.8390000000004
it's yeah terrible

3600.64 --> 3604.96
cognac with cinnamon tea made out of

3603.68 --> 3607.359
bark

3604.96 --> 3607.359
okay

3610.799 --> 3615.839
interesting don't think i ever tried

3626.839 --> 3629.839
that

3640.839 --> 3643.839
hmm

3646.96 --> 3657.839
lemon when were you there

3669.08 --> 3672.21
[Music]

3676.64 --> 3678.8799999999997
hmm

3680.16 --> 3685.839
all right

3692.53 --> 3699.8390000000004
[Music]

3693.76 --> 3699.8390000000004
okay u.n soldier really

3703.52 --> 3706.48
okay oh

3706.64 --> 3713.839
good to know that

3714.92 --> 3718.929
[Music]

3722.5 --> 3727.839
[Music]

3724.839 --> 3727.839
so

3738.839 --> 3742.72
hmm

3740.4 --> 3742.7200000000003
whoa

3752.48 --> 3756.72
wow my eyes white shut your grandpa was

3755.2 --> 3760.24
a

3756.72 --> 3760.24
quite a legend so it seems

3767.28 --> 3771.28
uh you have a i don't know

3771.52 --> 3783.839
i think i've heard it before but it

3773.28 --> 3783.8390000000004
doesn't really ring a bell

3794.839 --> 3797.839
so

3822.4 --> 3839.839
you mean one thing and do another hmm

3849.28 --> 3853.8390000000004
okay well that's an interesting saying

3851.599 --> 3853.839
then

3888.48 --> 3895.119
right well inhabit i don't know man it

3892.319 --> 3897.0389999999998
like that it that that really doesn't

3895.119 --> 3898.7200000000003
make any sense to me if you say that in

3897.039 --> 3902.96
your heart you're a pacifist

3898.72 --> 3906.319
yet you did all that

3902.96 --> 3908.64
that makes no sense because

3906.319 --> 3910.24
like the whole point about pacifism is

3908.64 --> 3913.92
that it is

3910.24 --> 3915.9199999999996
in ways sort of effective if you just

3913.92 --> 3919.039
don't engage

3915.92 --> 3919.039
so this seems like

3920.839 --> 3928.64
like i don't know

3924.799 --> 3930.88
the way you present it you either don't

3928.64 --> 3935.2799999999997
really understand what a pacifist is

3930.88 --> 3938.2400000000002
or you've like really done something

3935.28 --> 3939.119
yeah that that it is against your nature

3938.24 --> 3941.2799999999997
like

3939.119 --> 3941.28
i

3948.839 --> 3951.839
like

3956.4 --> 3960.48
like pacifism and defense

3960.64 --> 3965.839
that's not the same

3982.72 --> 3993.839
what okay

4004.839 --> 4007.839
ugh

4025.359 --> 4035.839
it's okay missouri bear

4029.039 --> 4035.8390000000004
yeah that happens

4036.96 --> 4044.2400000000002
uh yeah the marine corps don't like

4041.68 --> 4044.24
cannabis

4045.28 --> 4048.96
you gotta stay away from that too

4049.28 --> 4063.8390000000004
to try that

4063.92 --> 4069.09
yeah 1980 yeah

4066.96 --> 4070.319
wow

4069.09 --> 4077.839
[Music]

4070.319 --> 4077.839
this is a silly story man

4098.39 --> 4101.549
[Music]

4118.56 --> 4122.400000000001
yeah sorry for being with silent i'm

4120.359 --> 4126.0
contemplating like

4122.4 --> 4130.839
starting to give an opinion all that

4126.0 --> 4132.85
but i was yeah just feeling so nice and

4130.839 --> 4134.64
peaceful

4132.85 --> 4137.92
[Music]

4134.64 --> 4140.08
yeah but overall i think that the whole

4137.92 --> 4142.64
polarized situation in the middle east

4140.08 --> 4142.64
is a mess

4144.839 --> 4147.839
so

4149.839 --> 4156.3
hey adam hi to mikken morning

4153.21 --> 4156.3
[Music]

4158.839 --> 4161.839
afternoon

4172.839 --> 4175.839
so

4176.159 --> 4178.48
right

4181.199 --> 4186.3189999999995
yeah robin stanley now i'm definitely

4183.92 --> 4191.04
staring at chat a lot

4186.319 --> 4191.04
to see there's something that uh

4191.359 --> 4194.719
can turn into a subject

4195.44 --> 4200.639999999999
because yeah i don't know there is just

4197.679 --> 4200.64
a lot to talk about

4201.92 --> 4205.1990000000005
but yeah at the same time

4209.199 --> 4217.839999999999
like for me it's sometimes a bit hard to

4211.36 --> 4217.839999999999
pick you know

4218.64 --> 4222.719
because there's just a lot of like

4220.239 --> 4225.839999999999
conflict situations

4222.719 --> 4228.32
to talk about but as i do that that kind

4225.84 --> 4228.32
of then

4228.719 --> 4233.92
feels like it pulls me away from where i

4231.199 --> 4233.919999999999
really want to be

4234.08 --> 4238.4
so yeah just in general i keep tabs a

4237.52 --> 4240.400000000001
lot

4238.4 --> 4242.799999999999
and hey if somebody brings something up

4240.4 --> 4247.92
then i'll i'll at least

4242.8 --> 4247.92
respond to it and then that way

4248.159 --> 4252.239
i don't necessarily have to get deeply

4250.32 --> 4254.799999999999
dragged into it by default

4252.239 --> 4258.159
because it just came up in chat it's not

4254.8 --> 4260.2390000000005
like the subject i chose for the hangout

4258.159 --> 4263.67
something like that because then you're

4260.239 --> 4266.829
definitely going to be tied into the

4263.67 --> 4266.829
[Music]

4270.84 --> 4273.84
subject

4298.84 --> 4301.84
what

4318.64 --> 4323.280000000001
okay that's seems like a complex

4321.76 --> 4329.84
statement there

4323.28 --> 4329.84
missouri bear you have a

4331.92 --> 4336.64
that's a lesson in real life if the

4334.159 --> 4336.639999999999
system

4337.199 --> 4341.12
would do that in a deliberate sense

4339.199 --> 4346.32
seems they'd lie about

4341.12 --> 4346.32
everything to save their asses right

4352.56 --> 4356.2390000000005
why do you think there is not a system

4356.88 --> 4362.719
like the system doesn't necessarily have

4359.92 --> 4362.719
to be a living

4362.8 --> 4365.84
entity it could just be the

4364.48 --> 4368.959999999999
preponderance of

4365.84 --> 4372.4800000000005
certain applied mechanisms and

4368.96 --> 4375.84
like yeah

4372.48 --> 4379.599999999999
systems a system

4375.84 --> 4382.8
that people follow because

4379.6 --> 4386.56
it kind of works isn't that

4382.8 --> 4390.400000000001
the system doesn't have to be

4386.56 --> 4393.679
a a conscious entity that is in control

4390.4 --> 4397.28
no it's a system

4393.679 --> 4400.4
a mechanism why would you not

4397.28 --> 4400.4
say it's not there

4400.64 --> 4406.08
aren't people typically following a

4403.6 --> 4406.08
system

4408.88 --> 4412.0
there are not people behind it no the

4411.12 --> 4415.199
people are the

4412.0 --> 4418.64
system they all

4415.199 --> 4421.04
tap into that mechanism it it starts

4418.64 --> 4424.4800000000005
somebody might have conceived something

4421.04 --> 4427.84
then it it becomes and people start

4424.48 --> 4427.839999999999
tapping into it

4429.6 --> 4436.4800000000005
start using those mechanisms using the

4433.36 --> 4438.639999999999
what what it gives then they become part

4436.48 --> 4440.48
of the system that that's the system yes

4438.64 --> 4443.360000000001
it is people behind it

4440.48 --> 4444.4
it is the people that tap into the

4443.36 --> 4446.96
system

4444.4 --> 4447.44
it's like a yeah a game want to play the

4446.96 --> 4455.84
game

4447.44 --> 4455.839999999999
tap into the game you become the game

4458.4 --> 4471.159
if you let it

4468.08 --> 4471.159
[Music]

4471.36 --> 4474.799999999999
a mechanistic society missouri bear i

4474.32 --> 4478.08
don't know

4474.8 --> 4482.56
i'd say more a statistical society

4478.08 --> 4486.08
you know the machine this system

4482.56 --> 4488.2390000000005
is because of statistics a lot

4486.08 --> 4489.5199999999995
and even there's a lot of tomfoolery

4488.239 --> 4492.5599999999995
going on in certain

4489.52 --> 4496.080000000001
departments but like

4492.56 --> 4499.76
real statistics prove

4496.08 --> 4501.199
real effects like social engineering

4499.76 --> 4504.56
influence

4501.199 --> 4507.678999999999
statistical data like what does this do

4504.56 --> 4510.56
what does that word do what does this do

4507.679 --> 4511.679
and then yeah there's been such wide

4510.56 --> 4516.56
research in that

4511.679 --> 4519.84
over the last century that yeah

4516.56 --> 4522.96
all that data reveals

4519.84 --> 4524.719
if you do this this is going to be the

4522.96 --> 4526.159
amount of plus

4524.719 --> 4528.12
if you do this this is going to be the

4526.159 --> 4529.839999999999
amount of minus like in a

4528.12 --> 4533.44
multi-dimensional context

4529.84 --> 4536.4800000000005
and so then yeah certain effects

4533.44 --> 4538.48
just become apparent and people

4536.48 --> 4540.718999999999
tap into that research and they build

4538.48 --> 4544.0
their strategy

4540.719 --> 4546.32
on that knowledge and then eventually

4544.0 --> 4548.4
it attunes because yeah there are

4546.32 --> 4549.599999999999
certain effects that will be useful in

4548.4 --> 4552.639999999999
that context and so

4549.6 --> 4555.76
it will synchronize automatically

4552.64 --> 4559.360000000001
because of that and that

4555.76 --> 4559.360000000001
is the system

4564.84 --> 4570.88
see

4566.4 --> 4574.32
now the system is also being manipulated

4570.88 --> 4574.32
so there's also just

4575.04 --> 4581.6
false data in ways

4578.8 --> 4584.2390000000005
or false interpretations being used

4581.6 --> 4588.400000000001
based upon the data

4584.239 --> 4591.839999999999
to yeah desynchronize

4588.4 --> 4596.0
to kind of break the natural

4591.84 --> 4598.64
unity and efficiency apart through

4596.0 --> 4599.36
over competitiveness and isolation and

4598.64 --> 4602.64
all those

4599.36 --> 4609.839999999999
type of mechanisms that are creeping in

4602.64 --> 4609.84
to the system as it keeps on developing

4610.48 --> 4617.36
it becomes more unstable more

4613.52 --> 4617.360000000001
egotistical people will do

4618.159 --> 4625.839999999999
what advances them in that system

4622.32 --> 4626.96
as the as the range as the cohesion of

4625.84 --> 4630.96
the system is

4626.96 --> 4633.92
faltering more people will try to just

4630.96 --> 4636.4
do whatever with it manipulate it to get

4633.92 --> 4640.4
some kind of short-term advantage

4636.4 --> 4643.92
almost like a dying creature and

4640.4 --> 4646.159
yeah little predators try to

4643.92 --> 4647.4400000000005
take a bite out of it that's what

4646.159 --> 4650.08
happens

4647.44 --> 4652.0
when the unity and the purpose and the

4650.08 --> 4655.76
source are damaged

4652.0 --> 4657.92
and the system that is used is basically

4655.76 --> 4659.76
corrupted then it starts to falter and

4657.92 --> 4661.76
diffuse and then predators

4659.76 --> 4663.6
latch on and start ripping it apart

4661.76 --> 4667.360000000001
slowly bit by bit

4663.6 --> 4669.280000000001
infiltrating maybe changing it to their

4667.36 --> 4671.36
advantage and then eventually it just

4669.28 --> 4671.92
becomes like this frankenstein monster

4671.36 --> 4675.36
and

4671.92 --> 4679.04
whoever jumps on it will rearrange it

4675.36 --> 4682.239
to do whatever's left

4679.04 --> 4686.0
that's monster yeah the

4682.239 --> 4689.28
system system is basically just

4686.0 --> 4689.28
things that people do

4689.92 --> 4694.08
because it seems to work and it's based

4693.679 --> 4696.64
on

4694.08 --> 4696.64
research

4698.48 --> 4702.799999999999
i don't know maybe yeah does that make

4700.96 --> 4707.84
any sense guys

4702.8 --> 4707.84
i think it does

4718.08 --> 4723.6
most people have no influence in that

4720.159 --> 4723.599999999999
system [ __ ] just happens

4726.96 --> 4732.64
all right well it's very tough to get

4729.12 --> 4737.04
influence in that system you gotta

4732.64 --> 4737.280000000001
get a better grip basically of reality

4737.04 --> 4740.4
and

4737.28 --> 4741.12
and the power and like who are you yeah

4740.4 --> 4744.32
who is

4741.12 --> 4747.679
actually stopping things from developing

4744.32 --> 4750.32
or proceeding or whatever like who are

4747.679 --> 4752.159
the gatekeepers for real in the shadows

4750.32 --> 4754.719
if you don't figure all that out yeah

4752.159 --> 4755.759999999999
you can want to change the system but

4754.719 --> 4759.92
it's going to be

4755.76 --> 4763.84
immunized against it as you attempt it

4759.92 --> 4763.84
no it's much tougher to

4764.08 --> 4766.96
really change it

4767.199 --> 4773.04
just presents to you

4770.8 --> 4775.52
like look these are the pathways that

4773.04 --> 4778.32
are now part of the system

4775.52 --> 4781.4400000000005
based on all kinds of things and you

4778.32 --> 4781.44
want to do it or not

4782.32 --> 4786.32
i i don't want to do it by the way

4786.4 --> 4790.96
not not what's happening with it it's

4789.6 --> 4805.84
just out of control

4790.96 --> 4805.84
it's not worth it

4814.08 --> 4820.8
life is more random wow well look

4817.44 --> 4820.799999999999
life can be random

4821.04 --> 4824.4
if you allow it to be

4826.96 --> 4830.4800000000005
there's always going to be random

4828.4 --> 4831.5199999999995
aspects but how random are they on the

4830.48 --> 4833.839999999999
bigger scale

4831.52 --> 4833.84
you know

4834.719 --> 4840.2390000000005
plenty of random in the small but yeah

4838.8 --> 4842.56
that's the funny thing also about

4840.239 --> 4844.959999999999
statistics

4842.56 --> 4847.52
comes to statistics random isn't random

4844.96 --> 4851.52
anymore

4847.52 --> 4853.92
it's kind of fixed maybe slightly fluid

4851.52 --> 4856.2390000000005
but it is kind of fixed random isn't

4853.92 --> 4861.84
random anymore

4856.239 --> 4861.839999999999
and there's enough of it

4871.28 --> 4874.429999999999
[Music]

4900.84 --> 4907.52
so

4903.04 --> 4910.88
yeah yeah well of course the randomness

4907.52 --> 4913.280000000001
may be with perceived events

4910.88 --> 4914.32
small things as i said but yeah when it

4913.28 --> 4918.88
comes to design

4914.32 --> 4918.88
aspects of things like life

4923.92 --> 4931.84
definitely not random no way

4940.0 --> 4945.679
oh really tiny womble so what's the

4942.84 --> 4948.8
exception

4945.679 --> 4949.36
i'm pretty sure that basically even

4948.8 --> 4952.320000000001
stating

4949.36 --> 4954.88
beginning middle end is natural law

4952.32 --> 4954.88
entropy

4963.44 --> 4973.839999999999
to say not always seems kind of silly

4977.44 --> 4981.12
all right yeah you're welcome missouri

4978.88 --> 4981.12
bear

4984.48 --> 4990.5599999999995
oh tiny wumbo that weaver way funny

4995.679 --> 5001.84
that's okay

5012.84 --> 5018.400000000001
hmm

5015.84 --> 5019.4400000000005
yeah so what do you guys think of the

5018.4 --> 5022.96
sound

5019.44 --> 5026.5599999999995
so far in general and maybe

5022.96 --> 5030.88
bumpiness like is there any difference

5026.56 --> 5033.6
that you can notice so far

5030.88 --> 5035.84
compared to well i don't know the the

5033.6 --> 5039.120000000001
other 566

5035.84 --> 5042.4800000000005
shows oh well less because

5039.12 --> 5047.5199999999995
i got my uh my yeti

5042.48 --> 5050.48
my blue yeti mic somewhere later

5047.52 --> 5050.96
it sounds great but is it better or is

5050.48 --> 5053.759999999999
it

5050.96 --> 5054.56
the same or is that yeah is it is it

5053.76 --> 5058.320000000001
better

5054.56 --> 5058.320000000001
or is it just okay

5058.96 --> 5062.719
sounds like you're in the bathroom with

5061.12 --> 5064.8
me

5062.719 --> 5067.36
uh maybe that's because you're in the

5064.8 --> 5067.360000000001
bathroom

5068.4 --> 5072.159
great thanks for sharing that with us

5078.88 --> 5086.639
shouting at someone

5081.92 --> 5086.639
how dare you how dare you

5088.48 --> 5094.5599999999995
how dare you raise my my voice

5091.84 --> 5094.56
against you

5094.88 --> 5101.679
nah i don't know

5098.48 --> 5105.36
i i don't really want to like get

5101.679 --> 5105.36
pissed off loud you know i can

5105.679 --> 5113.36
i know it can be i guess just louder

5108.88 --> 5117.1990000000005
just like

5113.36 --> 5117.199
but i don't know

5117.28 --> 5121.04
this morning yeah i haven't felt a lot

5120.08 --> 5124.4
of need to

5121.04 --> 5127.84
to be loud because i feel pretty

5124.4 --> 5127.839999999999
peaceful inside

5128.66 --> 5131.7699999999995
[Music]

5148.719 --> 5153.04
not clipping for me cool

5153.12 --> 5155.84
okay

5160.239 --> 5163.839999999999
i can't wait to listen back really see

5162.159 --> 5166.638999999999
if it if it really mattered

5163.84 --> 5168.0
i wonder if it did if it will then i'll

5166.639 --> 5171.6
definitely make sure to thank

5168.0 --> 5175.199
nathan oakley for giving me that tip

5171.6 --> 5175.1990000000005
it's great thanks for looking out for me

5180.84 --> 5183.84
man

5191.52 --> 5197.84
very clear on your ipad okay cool

5201.92 --> 5209.84
that sounds a bit evil what

5206.4 --> 5213.199
god has a plenty heaven it has

5209.84 --> 5215.4400000000005
his time to go it was it was

5213.199 --> 5215.44
um

5216.48 --> 5220.0
how does that sound evil

5222.48 --> 5225.839999999999
what are we talking about

5241.36 --> 5253.839999999999
oh dear

5254.239 --> 5259.04
it's been something watching your

5256.32 --> 5262.5599999999995
transformation in confidence man

5259.04 --> 5265.04
really did it work

5262.56 --> 5267.84
it was really just deciding like no i'm

5265.04 --> 5267.84
not gonna

5269.6 --> 5274.320000000001
because it's almost like i i hang on to

5272.48 --> 5277.759999999999
it just didn't

5274.32 --> 5279.28
because i was scared of basically

5277.76 --> 5281.12
touching people in a way they wouldn't

5279.28 --> 5283.12
want to be touched

5281.12 --> 5285.04
because yeah there is a lot or there

5283.12 --> 5288.32
used to be a lot of those types around

5285.04 --> 5289.44
i don't know maybe they're all just

5288.32 --> 5294.239
scouring away

5289.44 --> 5297.12
it's like ah it's too bright

5294.239 --> 5297.12
i don't know what it is

5300.88 --> 5304.639
but yeah i i definitely do feel a lot

5304.08 --> 5307.76
more

5304.639 --> 5312.32
confident on average say

5307.76 --> 5315.6
like uh you say this

5312.32 --> 5316.0
when i feel good i feel very confident

5315.6 --> 5319.120000000001
like

5316.0 --> 5323.28
really confident and

5319.12 --> 5325.44
when i don't feel good i don't feel

5323.28 --> 5325.44
like

5326.56 --> 5331.04
i don't feel like oh my god i'm losing

5329.679 --> 5335.12
grip on the world

5331.04 --> 5335.679
now that's very very glad about that

5335.12 --> 5338.88
because

5335.679 --> 5339.1990000000005
yeah in the past that you did i did feel

5338.88 --> 5342.719
that

5339.199 --> 5342.719
it's like ah

5342.96 --> 5348.2390000000005
it's all gonna slip out of my hands this

5345.6 --> 5350.2390000000005
is just a terrible sensation

5348.239 --> 5353.919999999999
it's not happening anymore and i guess

5350.239 --> 5353.919999999999
that coincides but instead

5354.0 --> 5360.48
it tends to turn into just

5357.12 --> 5360.48
extreme frustration

5361.44 --> 5366.799999999999
but yeah i prefer that over this

5364.08 --> 5369.92
sensation that the entire world is just

5366.8 --> 5372.56
slipping into oblivion or something

5369.92 --> 5374.08
so yeah rather have some moments of just

5372.56 --> 5376.88
ah

5374.08 --> 5376.88
rage when

5377.679 --> 5382.159
but yeah i do feel a lot more confident

5381.36 --> 5385.199
on average

5382.159 --> 5388.4
and i it's like i have to do this

5385.199 --> 5390.239
it's important like even just for myself

5388.4 --> 5392.08
it's like i could do this for the world

5390.239 --> 5396.0
to give an example like how to climb

5392.08 --> 5399.84
out of that and i must

5396.0 --> 5399.84
do it for myself i must

5400.08 --> 5406.32
it's like the only way to escape this

5405.92 --> 5409.679
this

5406.32 --> 5411.92
oblivion that i see it's like a ghoulish

5409.679 --> 5414.4800000000005
picture for myself in the future

5411.92 --> 5415.12
if i do nothing it's almost like

5414.48 --> 5419.04
remember

5415.12 --> 5420.8
uh frodo staring in galadriel's mirror

5419.04 --> 5422.48
it's like this is what happens when you

5420.8 --> 5427.1990000000005
do nothing

5422.48 --> 5427.199
right you must find the confidence

5428.239 --> 5434.239
right and it's what i'm doing

5431.679 --> 5436.159
that's the kind of feeling i can wearing

5434.239 --> 5439.919999999999
a yeah a certain type of ring

5436.159 --> 5439.92
going to a bad place maybe

5442.0 --> 5445.12
anyway the metaphors are easily made you

5444.08 --> 5448.4
know

5445.12 --> 5452.639
just carrying the ring in this case the

5448.4 --> 5454.48
the flat earth yeah through the world

5452.639 --> 5456.639
and the orcs are just constantly

5454.48 --> 5458.799999999999
searching for us and attacking and [ __ ]

5456.639 --> 5458.8
and

5459.199 --> 5465.36
then we have to like defend

5462.32 --> 5465.92
other groups that are gonna get caught

5465.36 --> 5468.639
up

5465.92 --> 5470.2390000000005
in a bad way too and yeah i don't know i

5468.639 --> 5473.84
don't know metaphors

5470.239 --> 5473.839999999999
metaphors with lord of the rings what

5474.84 --> 5477.84
else

5482.4 --> 5487.28
all right hey well that's simple you

5484.48 --> 5490.159
have it if you see no pattern

5487.28 --> 5492.48
you think it's random you know i have a

5490.159 --> 5496.239
very specific statement

5492.48 --> 5497.919999999999
that i put down on my website in 2006 it

5496.239 --> 5500.799999999999
was or 2008

5497.92 --> 5502.2390000000005
long time ago it still stands to this

5500.8 --> 5507.84
day

5502.239 --> 5512.239
and that is chaos doesn't really exist

5507.84 --> 5515.360000000001
what chaos is is the lack

5512.239 --> 5520.5599999999995
of insight that would provide

5515.36 --> 5520.5599999999995
order because there is no real chaos

5520.96 --> 5527.44
there's a pattern to everything

5524.159 --> 5527.44
just don't see it

5528.159 --> 5531.5199999999995
and sometimes you should be lucky you

5529.76 --> 5533.679
don't you know the

5531.52 --> 5535.76
idea that things are just random that

5533.679 --> 5537.92
there's no control over it

5535.76 --> 5539.04
it's kind of relieving to the ego in a

5537.92 --> 5541.6
way that's why

5539.04 --> 5541.6
that's there

5543.679 --> 5547.84
it's a little mind squirt

5551.36 --> 5555.199
i had it a lot you know random random is

5554.8 --> 5557.52
kind of

5555.199 --> 5558.48
was always fascinating especially on the

5557.52 --> 5560.320000000001
short

5558.48 --> 5562.239
i i even did kind of like mind

5560.32 --> 5563.679
experiments trying to influence random

5562.239 --> 5567.44
and

5563.679 --> 5572.88
well in all my i don't know supernatural

5567.44 --> 5572.879999999999
research i think that affecting random

5573.199 --> 5577.04
at it i've probably been the most

5576.0 --> 5580.4
successful

5577.04 --> 5584.48
of most of my tests but it it

5580.4 --> 5586.879999999999
requires a very specific type of

5584.48 --> 5588.959999999999
mind and like it's more than just like

5586.88 --> 5591.04
oh i can just

5588.96 --> 5592.719
influence it just like that no it has to

5591.04 --> 5596.48
do with momentum and all that

5592.719 --> 5596.4800000000005
and i was able to kind of study that

5596.8 --> 5601.12
she can influence random even in the in

5599.679 --> 5603.84
the short

5601.12 --> 5607.84
if that can be done then then

5603.84 --> 5607.84
technically there is not really random

5612.56 --> 5616.159000000001
random it just seems random is just a

5614.639 --> 5619.1990000000005
lack of oversight really

5616.159 --> 5622.719
that's it that's my

5619.199 --> 5625.44
principled fundamental

5622.719 --> 5627.76
philosophy it really ties into

5625.44 --> 5631.199
everything there is no random

5627.76 --> 5631.8
not really doesn't mean that everything

5631.199 --> 5636.08
is all

5631.8 --> 5640.88
pre-arranged to the consciousnesses

5636.08 --> 5643.36
to the consciousness of people but

5640.88 --> 5644.639
technically random just doesn't really

5643.36 --> 5648.08
exist

5644.639 --> 5651.76
it's like a aberrational concept

5648.08 --> 5651.76
side effect for the conscious

5652.96 --> 5656.08
it's like a yeah

5656.159 --> 5663.28
a tool for the consciousness

5659.52 --> 5665.76
to analyze yeah

5663.28 --> 5665.759999999999
patterns

5671.04 --> 5676.719
the random explorer you do exist

5674.48 --> 5676.718999999999
sure

5679.28 --> 5683.5199999999995
but yeah you know it's it's it's proven

5681.6 --> 5685.360000000001
statistically

5683.52 --> 5688.159000000001
when there's enough random it's no

5685.36 --> 5688.159
longer random

5692.32 --> 5698.84
and that's like a proof thing now my

5695.679 --> 5702.88
philosophy that's another that's my

5698.84 --> 5702.88
philosophical approach to it

5704.88 --> 5710.88
right but you know you did you know that

5708.239 --> 5712.839999999999
in programs that work like with fractals

5710.88 --> 5715.1990000000005
and with 3d

5712.84 --> 5718.400000000001
rendering there is

5715.199 --> 5721.678999999999
such a thing as a random seed

5718.4 --> 5725.199
they call it a seed

5721.679 --> 5728.32
right and if you put in the same

5725.199 --> 5728.719
seed which is like the the pattern which

5728.32 --> 5733.119
could

5728.719 --> 5734.96
be taken as the random factor pattern

5733.119 --> 5737.28
yeah it always will turn out exactly the

5734.96 --> 5740.639
same thing

5737.28 --> 5742.96
so yeah statistically

5740.639 --> 5745.119
technically random just isn't random

5742.96 --> 5748.4800000000005
it's a consciousness perceptive

5745.119 --> 5749.839999999999
approach and so people that will be

5748.48 --> 5752.879999999999
random

5749.84 --> 5756.639
will always be random

5752.88 --> 5759.76
in their ways to their

5756.639 --> 5761.4400000000005
level because another person

5759.76 --> 5763.52
might not have any connection not even

5761.44 --> 5766.719
know about the other person

5763.52 --> 5767.84
they will also live perceiving that

5766.719 --> 5771.44
randomness

5767.84 --> 5775.76
and they will be random in

5771.44 --> 5779.119
their way with their trademarks

5775.76 --> 5781.84
to recognize it and their level of how

5779.119 --> 5782.96
random they will go see so random isn't

5781.84 --> 5785.84
really random sorry

5782.96 --> 5785.84
i don't want to

5786.639 --> 5790.08
don't need to push this too far why is

5788.8 --> 5792.320000000001
this this is

5790.08 --> 5793.44
kind of random that is subject is being

5792.32 --> 5797.679
brought up

5793.44 --> 5799.839999999999
hey not really

5797.679 --> 5799.84
so

5800.96 --> 5804.639
24 watching yeah

5809.93 --> 5813.52
[Music]

5816.159 --> 5822.799999999999
thanks for watching roger mc

5819.52 --> 5824.84
please share the show you know

5822.8 --> 5826.400000000001
especially if you think it's just like

5824.84 --> 5829.76
oh no

5826.4 --> 5832.0
nobody's watching irwin yeah share the

5829.76 --> 5832.0
show

5836.0 --> 5840.159
yeah share it with conspiracy cats maybe

5838.48 --> 5844.239
you can do another

5840.159 --> 5847.92
review of my show or maybe

5844.239 --> 5850.638999999999
sean hawkins he could do another review

5847.92 --> 5851.92
of my show you know there's all these

5850.639 --> 5854.56
people out there doing

5851.92 --> 5856.639
reviews of my show i don't even know

5854.56 --> 5858.56
what they're about really

5856.639 --> 5861.84
i get the feeling that it's gonna make

5858.56 --> 5865.119000000001
me very uncomfortable watching that

5861.84 --> 5866.88
but hey if you guys bump into that

5865.119 --> 5869.599999999999
sort of thing i personally would

5866.88 --> 5872.639
appreciate it if you could watch it

5869.6 --> 5876.719
kind of for me so like

5872.639 --> 5879.6
yeah like

5876.719 --> 5881.44
who knows there might be certain levels

5879.6 --> 5882.320000000001
of approach or things they've said that

5881.44 --> 5884.5599999999995
i i might

5882.32 --> 5885.759999999999
actually need to respond to just for my

5884.56 --> 5890.080000000001
own sake

5885.76 --> 5890.08
but i'm i just i'm not gonna watch that

5894.84 --> 5899.679
[ __ ]

5896.639 --> 5901.28
because yeah this is just the the the

5899.679 --> 5903.04
chances

5901.28 --> 5904.32
that that that it's like any kind of

5903.04 --> 5906.0
constructive thing

5904.32 --> 5907.44
that i could do something with is just

5906.0 --> 5911.119
extremely low but i

5907.44 --> 5914.48
do kind of want to know what level

5911.119 --> 5916.799999999999
is is there anything at all

5914.48 --> 5919.119
that that i might need to address or

5916.8 --> 5919.119000000001
something

5921.52 --> 5926.8
so yeah if you guys spot any of the

5924.239 --> 5927.678999999999
silly ballers making videos about me or

5926.8 --> 5931.360000000001
something i i

5927.679 --> 5934.8
kind of would appreciate it if you would

5931.36 --> 5938.719
donate just a tiny bit of your brain to

5934.8 --> 5941.360000000001
indulge that [ __ ] for me and see

5938.719 --> 5945.28
yeah so you can reassure me that would

5941.36 --> 5948.0
be very appreciated i really mean that

5945.28 --> 5950.5599999999995
because i i've tried some of it you know

5948.0 --> 5950.56
and it's just

5950.96 --> 5953.84
oh

5956.08 --> 5960.32
thanks guys you know only if you can

5958.96 --> 5963.76
take it

5960.32 --> 5966.96
i i just can't on average you know

5963.76 --> 5969.119000000001
if they just choose to be just i don't

5966.96 --> 5969.119
know

5969.84 --> 5973.679
follow the same kind of life principles

5972.48 --> 5976.159
code of conduct just

5973.679 --> 5978.719
like how do you deal with people you

5976.159 --> 5981.599999999999
just try to be real gentlemen and not

5978.719 --> 5984.4
fake gentleman for your political stance

5981.6 --> 5985.6
to try and use that as a contrast in how

5984.4 --> 5988.5599999999995
i'm supposedly

5985.6 --> 5990.0
such an anti-gentleman you know just

5988.56 --> 5993.52
non-political

5990.0 --> 5998.0
otherwise i just can't deal with this

5993.52 --> 6001.92
i i don't want political fight

5998.0 --> 6001.92
it can't stand that [ __ ]

6002.0 --> 6005.04
it's so useless like every everything is

6004.56 --> 6006.719
lost

6005.04 --> 6008.48
all the arguments are lost everything is

6006.719 --> 6012.4
just lost when you when you

6008.48 --> 6012.4
really engage with that for me

6014.88 --> 6018.0
but yeah if there's some people that are

6017.119 --> 6021.44
like really

6018.0 --> 6023.6
trying to like seriously attack me or

6021.44 --> 6026.08
who knows you know where they'll go

6023.6 --> 6027.1990000000005
maybe they're really planning to sue me

6026.08 --> 6029.28
or

6027.199 --> 6030.879999999999
get me committed i don't know what the

6029.28 --> 6032.639
[ __ ] they're up to you know i really

6030.88 --> 6033.679
don't know what they even can do i know

6032.639 --> 6037.119
they're

6033.679 --> 6040.56
total liars and quite delusional

6037.119 --> 6042.48
like badly publicly but that doesn't

6040.56 --> 6045.1990000000005
mean that

6042.48 --> 6047.839999999999
yeah that the rest of society is even

6045.199 --> 6051.28
gonna recognize or care about that

6047.84 --> 6054.96
so i i yeah it would be good to just

6051.28 --> 6057.679
know what they're up to

6054.96 --> 6060.639
they're dark little schemes little

6057.679 --> 6060.639
wannabe grapplers

6062.08 --> 6066.159
anyway i'm gonna round out the show it's

6064.159 --> 6068.799999999999
getting kind of silly

6066.159 --> 6069.44
oh yeah yeah yeah i know shawn hawkins

6068.8 --> 6071.360000000001
shows

6069.44 --> 6074.0
i know that for a fact that nathan

6071.36 --> 6077.04
oakley loves to watch his shows

6074.0 --> 6082.08
and he's like enjoying it just the

6077.04 --> 6082.08
the clowning aspect like

6082.8 --> 6086.320000000001
i get that so if sean hawkins says

6085.76 --> 6088.88
anything

6086.32 --> 6092.08
silly about me then i'm sure he's gonna

6088.88 --> 6096.32
tell me if it's important

6092.08 --> 6096.32
like conspiracy cats i don't know man

6096.8 --> 6102.8
or even simon dan or whatever although

6101.119 --> 6104.4
i don't know there's there's lots of

6102.8 --> 6104.96
ballers out there that do this kind of

6104.4 --> 6108.799999999999
thing so

6104.96 --> 6111.119
i don't know i might have been reviewed

6108.8 --> 6113.119000000001
maybe it's even like a thing like hey if

6111.119 --> 6115.199
you want to be a serious baller you know

6113.119 --> 6117.28
you want to have a name out there

6115.199 --> 6118.5599999999995
you got to do an episode where you have

6117.28 --> 6122.08
to review how

6118.56 --> 6123.4400000000005
crazy arwen is you know maybe that's a

6122.08 --> 6127.28
thing now

6123.44 --> 6128.879999999999
i bet there's a lot of reviews like that

6127.28 --> 6134.719
are you going on ball busters tonight

6128.88 --> 6137.84
yeah if it's live sure at a meekan

6134.719 --> 6141.28
nathan is whack though

6137.84 --> 6144.719
you think uh

6141.28 --> 6146.84
nah nathan just likes to whack ballers

6144.719 --> 6149.84
like on the head and in the balls and

6146.84 --> 6149.84
[ __ ]

6152.0 --> 6155.76
but i don't know he wouldn't he would

6154.0 --> 6157.679
never do that

6155.76 --> 6159.92
to people that don't really deserve it

6157.679 --> 6159.92
though

6160.32 --> 6164.0
but i get it if you just don't want to

6162.08 --> 6167.28
sit through that it is really like

6164.0 --> 6170.96
people are just being torn apart

6167.28 --> 6173.679
he's not real yeah he is

6170.96 --> 6173.679
yes he is

6174.239 --> 6182.5599999999995
i've met him this is who he is

6177.44 --> 6186.638999999999
that's how he lives it's a bit weird

6182.56 --> 6186.639
maybe to you but yeah

6187.04 --> 6191.84
it's not an act

6194.48 --> 6202.4
it's like a posture you know it's like

6197.76 --> 6202.400000000001
okay i'm in nathan mode now

6202.84 --> 6208.400000000001
but he

6205.119 --> 6210.32
he is a real person with with real

6208.4 --> 6213.599999999999
person balance and he even

6210.32 --> 6217.5199999999995
lets on some of it which i i think is

6213.6 --> 6218.0
really cool just shows more confidence

6217.52 --> 6222.88
that yeah

6218.0 --> 6222.88
i can be honest so

6226.639 --> 6228.96
right

6230.639 --> 6234.639
likes to swing the bat hard on wasteful

6233.119 --> 6240.159
ballers

6234.639 --> 6240.159000000001
yep okay amanda young that's fine

6241.04 --> 6247.76
thank you well i appreciate it to be

6244.48 --> 6250.5599999999995
ranked as more real than nathan i do

6247.76 --> 6250.56
appreciate that

6258.96 --> 6262.4800000000005
he hosts like a host that's what she's

6261.36 --> 6264.32
saying

6262.48 --> 6265.839999999999
right well you have to you know he's

6264.32 --> 6269.28
dude uh

6265.84 --> 6270.159000000001
she has like he this is nathan has a big

6269.28 --> 6273.92
panel

6270.159 --> 6277.28
and like a baller panel answers

6273.92 --> 6281.119
you have to be a host like what i do

6277.28 --> 6283.5199999999995
right here it it won't work

6281.119 --> 6284.5599999999995
as well if i like have a big panel on

6283.52 --> 6285.92
top of it

6284.56 --> 6287.679
it's a different way of just doing

6285.92 --> 6288.639
things because otherwise it's just going

6287.679 --> 6291.119
to be

6288.639 --> 6292.719
people sitting in the background

6291.119 --> 6294.32
basically getting frustrated that

6292.719 --> 6295.52
they're not allowed to talk all of the

6294.32 --> 6298.719
time

6295.52 --> 6300.2390000000005
and that's yeah it happens sometimes

6298.719 --> 6304.0
with nathan

6300.239 --> 6305.919999999999
but yeah not a lot not a lot anymore you

6304.0 --> 6309.28
know he has periods where he's just very

6305.92 --> 6311.28
hungry for ballers this is

6309.28 --> 6313.599999999999
just like no you're not taking you know

6311.28 --> 6314.5599999999995
no you you can't even have a nibble on

6313.6 --> 6317.84
his toe

6314.56 --> 6317.84
i'm gonna take the whole thing

6335.92 --> 6341.36
yes stopping traffic in my rest ahead

6338.96 --> 6343.52
yes he probably would if he thought it

6341.36 --> 6345.599999999999
wouldn't do too much damage

6343.52 --> 6347.1990000000005
like he would of course never speak like

6345.6 --> 6351.04
that to

6347.199 --> 6351.04
an authority figure or anything

6351.84 --> 6357.04
but yeah if he'd meet ballers face to

6355.04 --> 6357.84
face i think he would talk just like

6357.04 --> 6363.36
that

6357.84 --> 6365.84
absolutely and by the way so do i

6363.36 --> 6365.839999999999
oh yeah

6366.4 --> 6373.839999999999
including the rage win part if it comes

6369.84 --> 6373.84
to that

6380.639 --> 6384.56
yeah he is kind of a big guy that's

6382.32 --> 6384.5599999999995
right

6385.36 --> 6404.0
he's taller than me

6401.28 --> 6405.599999999999
hmm that's an interesting tactical

6404.0 --> 6407.199
analysis there stopping trafficking

6405.6 --> 6414.4800000000005
arrest ahead thanks for you

6407.199 --> 6417.44
for that no

6414.48 --> 6421.04
random explorer i wouldn't say that size

6417.44 --> 6424.799999999999
especially when it comes to like

6421.04 --> 6429.5199999999995
social domination situations and

6424.8 --> 6432.0
oh yeah that matters it does it does

6429.52 --> 6433.76
you know maybe like in physical combat

6432.0 --> 6436.56
it wouldn't matter as much

6433.76 --> 6436.96
other factors might be more important

6436.56 --> 6439.1990000000005
but

6436.96 --> 6440.0
yeah when it comes to just social

6439.199 --> 6443.839999999999
interactions

6440.0 --> 6443.84
it matters it does

6443.92 --> 6457.84
and big bear can tell you all about that

6446.639 --> 6457.84
on his streams

6459.76 --> 6463.1990000000005
yeah that's right but yeah when you're

6461.36 --> 6463.92
talking about the falling part you're

6463.199 --> 6467.759999999999
talking about

6463.92 --> 6470.0
physical combat and that's not what this

6467.76 --> 6472.0
is about that's not what nathan does

6470.0 --> 6475.28
he's not looking to pick a physical

6472.0 --> 6475.28
fight absolutely not

6475.6 --> 6480.08
he's just interested in smashing

6478.32 --> 6484.719
smashing people's arrogant

6480.08 --> 6499.84
delusions mercilessly

6484.719 --> 6499.84
whenever necessary

6507.84 --> 6516.56
wow the random explorer dude

6513.36 --> 6520.0
nathan only talks

6516.56 --> 6522.88
like bad to people

6520.0 --> 6524.96
that are delusional to people that draw

6522.88 --> 6526.96
in machinations that have been refuted

6524.96 --> 6528.4
that do red herrings constantly that

6526.96 --> 6530.4
bring in straw man

6528.4 --> 6532.5599999999995
yeah you're if you're gonna do that face

6530.4 --> 6536.719
to face in real life yeah you're gonna

6532.56 --> 6536.719
have to expect the same type of response

6539.76 --> 6545.6
you know and dank is gonna isn't gonna

6543.119 --> 6546.719
act like that in nathan's presence

6545.6 --> 6551.1990000000005
because he's not a

6546.719 --> 6554.32
baller idiot so he doesn't need to

6551.199 --> 6557.598999999999
be afraid that he might not

6554.32 --> 6560.799999999999
take that behavior because he didn't

6557.599 --> 6568.32
do anything to warrant that behavior

6560.8 --> 6571.76
you see

6568.32 --> 6576.48
yeah exactly dang enough about nathan

6571.76 --> 6583.84
okay sorry amanda it just

6576.48 --> 6583.839999999999
it needed to be addressed for a moment

6589.84 --> 6594.08
this is it's just a moment of uh social

6593.119 --> 6597.679
order

6594.08 --> 6601.5199999999995
it's just

6597.679 --> 6604.56
needs to be dealt with needs to be

6601.52 --> 6608.080000000001
made clear who is what

6604.56 --> 6608.080000000001

6608.8 --> 6611.84
good old no curse

6617.36 --> 6621.199

arthurton

6659.92 --> 6664.08
and stop a trafficking arrest i don't

6662.48 --> 6667.44
think nathan

6664.08 --> 6670.719
would engage in physical violence like

6667.44 --> 6672.638999999999
unless he like was like in very serious

6670.719 --> 6674.719
danger

6672.639 --> 6677.1990000000005
i just don't see it happening i know

6674.719 --> 6679.28
maybe i'm wrong

6677.199 --> 6680.96
i don't think you would like to share

6679.28 --> 6683.199
about that anyway

6680.96 --> 6684.639
but i don't see him as a guy like that

6683.199 --> 6688.879999999999
at all really

6684.639 --> 6688.88
sorry for bringing it back up anyway

6689.36 --> 6693.28
i think nathan would rather just catch

6691.84 --> 6696.32
it on camera and then go

6693.28 --> 6697.599
to the police with it and then just like

6696.32 --> 6699.84
yeah

6697.599 --> 6702.0
yeah you punched me i got it on camera

6699.84 --> 6705.4400000000005
that would be more than nathan's lane in

6702.0 --> 6705.44

6707.199 --> 6723.839999999999
