appointment at 12 o'clock

95.759 --> 102.399
and yeah it just i needed a lunch

99.2 --> 106.88
i'll explain later anyway the weather is

102.399 --> 109.68
different again

106.88 --> 110.88
it seems like the the rain and hill is

109.68 --> 113.92
over

110.88 --> 115.03999999999999
or it feels like that because it's kind

113.92 --> 119.6
of

115.04 --> 119.60000000000001
kind of nice and warm outside

120.96 --> 124.96
it's not really a lot of wind there has

124.24 --> 127.6
been some

124.96 --> 128.79999999999998
sun in between the clouds some blue

127.6 --> 131.759
spots

128.8 --> 131.75900000000001
if you look carefully

132.959 --> 135.20000000000002
and

136.16 --> 143.44
yeah maybe the uh the crazy

140.16 --> 145.35999999999999
weather has seized for the moment but

143.44 --> 147.44
hey i could be wrong

145.36 --> 149.59900000000002
maybe in an hour or something another

147.44 --> 150.07999999999998
big cloud comes hovering over and it's

149.599 --> 153.35999999999999
uh

150.08 --> 153.36
hail all over again

154.239 --> 157.84
it is april after all

160.41 --> 163.5
[Music]

163.519 --> 171.84
april the 8th of 2021

167.84 --> 171.84
to be precise

174.48 --> 180.319
right so yeah started up late

178.64 --> 182.319
because i had an appointment i was kind

180.319 --> 183.04
of nervous for it even though it turned

182.319 --> 185.83999999999997
out to be

183.04 --> 185.84
absolutely fine

186.4 --> 191.04
uh i went for groceries quickly got back

189.2 --> 193.67999999999998
and then i got so hungry

191.04 --> 195.92
like and i was like right when i should

193.68 --> 199.44
have been starting the show

195.92 --> 200.48
i was like yeah no way like the nerves

199.44 --> 203.35999999999999
dying down

200.48 --> 204.39999999999998
a lot of hunger to compensate typically

203.36 --> 207.12
happens

204.4 --> 208.64000000000001
so i just had to get lunch before

207.12 --> 212.959
starting the show

208.64 --> 216.55999999999997
and yeah i took the time 25 minutes

212.959 --> 218.799
i'm still glad that i did because i

216.56 --> 220.799
it would have been quite a chore sitting

218.799 --> 226.31900000000002
through two hours just being really

220.799 --> 228.72
really hungry constantly

226.319 --> 228.72
right

233.439 --> 241.84
so is anybody out there

252.84 --> 255.84
so

257.68 --> 263.36
right right i did make notes

261.12 --> 264.479
every time i make notes it's always

263.36 --> 267.52000000000004
better

264.479 --> 268.0
that's why i should just no matter what

267.52 --> 271.28
i feel

268.0 --> 273.84
like make the freaking notes just

271.28 --> 274.71999999999997
just freaking do it every single time

273.84 --> 282.08
just do it

274.72 --> 287.28000000000003
because it's always better

282.08 --> 287.28
uh hold on let me fill them up

291.919 --> 296.71999999999997
right so yeah yeah uh flat earth early

294.8 --> 298.479
bird show yesterday was pretty decent i

296.72 --> 304.0
didn't watch it back

298.479 --> 308.56
at least it had a a better composure

304.0 --> 311.759
from what i felt despite decided moments

308.56 --> 315.12
and also just the silent moments

311.759 --> 318.32
it has been puzzling me a lot like

315.12 --> 321.12
what why why do i have that

318.32 --> 323.44
is that self-sabotage is there really

321.12 --> 325.84000000000003
nothing else i can do

323.44 --> 325.84
in the moment

326.8 --> 330.72
because it always kind of comes

328.16 --> 333.6
unexpected it

330.72 --> 334.8
it has a great resemblance to basically

333.6 --> 338.08000000000004
getting on the stage

334.8 --> 341.12
and getting a blank like getting

338.08 --> 342.71999999999997
what you call that a blackout where you

341.12 --> 343.36
suddenly just don't know what to say

342.72 --> 346.32000000000005
anymore

343.36 --> 347.039
well it sort of resembles that but it's

346.32 --> 349.68
not that

347.039 --> 349.68
it's kind of

351.68 --> 355.28000000000003
like yeah i could in those moments

354.479 --> 358.639
literally

355.28 --> 360.63899999999995
grab the first shitty shitty attention

358.639 --> 363.12
grabbing thing that comes to mind

360.639 --> 364.96000000000004
and trust me in those moments there is

363.12 --> 369.44
that sort of thing

364.96 --> 369.44
it's just not good for anything

369.759 --> 377.12
and that's kind of weird to me

374.4 --> 377.67999999999995
to notice that and then i get a little

377.12 --> 381.44
jealous

377.68 --> 383.44
of other people that are so proficient

381.44 --> 386.0
at keeping it flowing

383.44 --> 387.759
and i'm trying to puzzle why is that is

386.0 --> 390.24
that because they're kind of set

387.759 --> 392.47900000000004
in a certain railroad and then the price

390.24 --> 395.44
is you don't move away too far away from

392.479 --> 399.0
the railroad is it a format

395.44 --> 402.8
issue and that i'm always insisting on

399.0 --> 402.8
continuously developing

403.039 --> 407.199
when everybody's saying like hey irwin

405.44 --> 411.039
maybe you could just

407.199 --> 414.08000000000004
settle down get a life

411.039 --> 419.44
keep it contained but no

414.08 --> 422.96
irwin has to have the freedom of reach

419.44 --> 427.36
to find the mythical special moments

422.96 --> 430.0
and that's why i don't settle down

427.36 --> 432.16
that's why i don't get over certain

430.0 --> 434.08
things

432.16 --> 436.96000000000004
and why i'm trying to keep things in

434.08 --> 438.56
place the way they are

436.96 --> 440.96
and it's really weirding me out

438.56 --> 443.52
sometimes because

440.96 --> 445.44
if you didn't have all the pieces and

443.52 --> 448.79999999999995
you would get a look into my life

445.44 --> 452.96
you would just think i am like

448.8 --> 456.0
a very typical type of mentally ill

452.96 --> 458.23999999999995
retracted can't adapt can't get over

456.0 --> 461.52
certain things

458.24 --> 465.199
type of situation

461.52 --> 467.19899999999996
but then i integrate that with the

465.199 --> 468.40000000000003
things that i also do and certainly it's

467.199 --> 472.319
not that anymore

468.4 --> 474.0
yay very complicated not straightforward

472.319 --> 476.84000000000003
there is no solution

474.0 --> 478.16
all right anybody out there there is no

476.84 --> 481.28
solution

478.16 --> 483.59900000000005
people often do this like oh let's just

481.28 --> 486.0
hand our win the solution to his

483.599 --> 488.0
problems

486.0 --> 489.199
a lot of people do this and they mean

488.0 --> 491.68
well

489.199 --> 492.96000000000004
but they're doing it in reflection to

491.68 --> 497.039
how they've learned to do

492.96 --> 499.52
things and that doesn't work

497.039 --> 499.52
with me

502.96 --> 507.84
it's too much extra side effects

508.24 --> 511.599
hello tom parker

512.719 --> 516.08
thanks for being first in chat

517.12 --> 521.839
i have a late show

531.04 --> 535.519
ah your self analysis you self analyze

534.72 --> 537.519
quite a lot

535.519 --> 539.76
do you think that others don't and

537.519 --> 549.839
therefore worry less

539.76 --> 549.8389999999999
well that's one part of it yeah

556.24 --> 562.399
right but others also just basically

559.36 --> 565.6
have their parts of their soul

562.399 --> 568.959
for grab like literally for grab they

565.6 --> 569.76
don't know what that means they don't

568.959 --> 572.399
see it

569.76 --> 574.8389999999999
that's why they do it or they think it's

572.399 --> 577.92
normal or

574.839 --> 582.399
right i do

577.92 --> 585.519
very specific things with my mind

582.399 --> 588.959
i have very fine-tuned

585.519 --> 593.04
senses and every time

588.959 --> 596.56
i just adapt oh are we just get over it

593.04 --> 599.92
it's like i'm getting electrocuted right

596.56 --> 599.92
in my virtual space

602.839 --> 607.7600000000001
right

604.88 --> 610.24
this is not well yeah this sounds a bit

607.76 --> 610.24
dramatic

610.88 --> 614.24
and yeah other people have went through

612.8 --> 616.959
that i know they have

614.24 --> 617.76
i have went through that in the past

616.959 --> 620.8
guess what

617.76 --> 624.079
i sensed from that yeah

620.8 --> 627.5999999999999
when you accept it to be standard

624.079 --> 628.64
it's going to wear certain parts of your

627.6 --> 631.12
senses off

628.64 --> 633.1999999999999
and if you accept it for too long and if

631.12 --> 634.64
you've normalized it to yourself and

633.2 --> 638.5600000000001
lose sight of it

634.64 --> 641.76
then so do you lose

638.56 --> 644.88
that range of ability forever

641.76 --> 648.399
it will never return

644.88 --> 650.72
right unless you literally

648.399 --> 652.399
recognize the value of the thing that

650.72 --> 655.44
you're losing in that process

652.399 --> 657.6
and then turning it around

655.44 --> 659.44
which is going to cause quite a hassle

657.6 --> 662.16
because everybody's going to think oh

659.44 --> 665.2790000000001
you're going out of control again

662.16 --> 667.92
yeah right so yeah be careful

665.279 --> 670.24
if you have if you do have like very

667.92 --> 674.24
serious ego issues with something

670.24 --> 678.0
and it really can be made to make sense

674.24 --> 678.0
then don't follow this pattern

678.399 --> 686.32
don't do that if you're just

682.56 --> 686.3199999999999
palpably out of control

686.8 --> 693.519
if you have nothing to lose

690.0 --> 698.48
by getting over those things

693.519 --> 698.48
then do it do it

699.6 --> 705.44
right if you can actually point at what

703.279 --> 708.56
you're going to lose by doing that

705.44 --> 712.399
and you are using it with value

708.56 --> 717.8389999999999
and with future prospects then be very

712.399 --> 717.839
careful with your choices

723.839 --> 733.44
ah hello dutch sailor

731.6 --> 735.36
right so yeah i'm basically just

733.44 --> 737.2790000000001
starting this up

735.36 --> 739.6800000000001
because i can and because there's a lot

737.279 --> 742.16
of silence and because

739.68 --> 742.88
i'm sick of the silent pauses if i have

742.16 --> 746.079
to

742.88 --> 750.399
level down in my engagement then i'll

746.079 --> 752.8
goddamn level down yeah

750.399 --> 755.12
i'll do it because i'm not just going to

752.8 --> 756.0
be silent and waiting for people to get

755.12 --> 758.0
to the freaking

756.0 --> 759.36
intellectual level and then ask me

758.0 --> 761.92
questions so i can

759.36 --> 763.04
give a sublime answer because people are

761.92 --> 766.959
not doing it

763.04 --> 771.1999999999999
even you guys you're not doing it

766.959 --> 773.76
you're waiting for me to bring something

771.2 --> 774.639
to power you up so that you might attain

773.76 --> 777.36
the level

774.639 --> 777.92
of questioning that could yeah do that

777.36 --> 781.12
with me

777.92 --> 785.12
right so this is like a dead end

781.12 --> 801.839
it's a dead bounce it's running into

785.12 --> 801.839
so i guess i'll have to level down then

803.7 --> 810.0500000000001
[Music]

814.88 --> 821.76
freaking youtube stop

818.399 --> 822.88

nothing on youtube nothing ever

917.04 --> 921.279

1906.08 --> 1910.399
he had some serious fantastical

1908.32 --> 1913.76
inspiration energy yesterday

1910.399 --> 1916.08
over at brandon's he was feeling like he

1913.76 --> 1918.72
was a king on his throne

1916.08 --> 1921.12
just laying out like the the

1918.72 --> 1923.44
mathematical mechanics and all that

1921.12 --> 1925.4399999999998
and you can really see that that is like

1923.44 --> 1928.3990000000001
what he really loves

1925.44 --> 1931.279
like he loves the structure within the

1928.399 --> 1933.6
virtual realm

1931.279 --> 1934.32
he's just not very anchored to any kind

1933.6 --> 1937.279
of

1934.32 --> 1940.08
physics original state like he just

1937.279 --> 1943.039
cares about the structure

1940.08 --> 1943.039
and how it fits

1943.76 --> 1946.24
to him

1947.44 --> 1953.1200000000001
yeah adam jokowski it is flat it's

1950.799 --> 1954.399
absolutely flat and stationary and don't

1953.12 --> 1957.6
forget enclosed

1954.399 --> 1960.32
flat stationary and closed flat

1957.6 --> 1963.12
stationary and closed

1960.32 --> 1963.76
flat stationary and closed absolutely

1963.12 --> 1966.399
it's

1963.76 --> 1968.96
yes it is you have no proof of curvature

1966.399 --> 1971.5189999999998
that you have no geometric horizon

1968.96 --> 1974.88
to be a sphere edge that blocks things

1971.519 --> 1977.84
into the distance you don't have that

1974.88 --> 1991.8400000000001
right next one you don't have the

1977.84 --> 1991.84
spherical geometry anymore

1993.45 --> 1996.509
[Music]

2004.32 --> 2009.6789999999999
show me my physics degree i had physics

2007.12 --> 2009.6789999999999
in school

2013.76 --> 2021.279
but yeah i i don't need a physics

2017.44 --> 2024.64
degree to be able to prove to you

2021.279 --> 2026.64
that the earth's geometry is not

2024.64 --> 2029.919
spherical

2026.64 --> 2032.96
yeah this is all too easy like

2029.919 --> 2035.3600000000001
technically not recommending it

2032.96 --> 2037.3600000000001
technically the way that we've refined

2035.36 --> 2038.399
things over at the flat earth debates

2037.36 --> 2041.84
yeah i'm giving

2038.399 --> 2045.039
us us nathan oakley

2041.84 --> 2047.6789999999999
qe and me too full

2045.039 --> 2048.72
credit for this yeah for the development

2047.679 --> 2051.919
of this yeah i'm

2048.72 --> 2054.0
taking it i'm taking full credit

2051.919 --> 2055.44
oh yeah yeah you prominent people out

2054.0 --> 2057.359
there oh you think

2055.44 --> 2058.8
you're so good you got so many followers

2057.359 --> 2062.0789999999997
yeah yeah i'm taking

2058.8 --> 2064.96
full credit for that yeah

2062.079 --> 2066.7200000000003
we've developed understanding systems

2064.96 --> 2070.56
response systems

2066.72 --> 2074.72
to yeah baller claims and trickery

2070.56 --> 2078.24
and magician trickery so well

2074.72 --> 2081.2799999999997
that you can literally have an iq of 80

2078.24 --> 2084.879
and if you just have a good

2081.28 --> 2089.8390000000004
feel for people and where it's at

2084.879 --> 2089.839
then you can absolutely

2092.159 --> 2095.359
dude stop doing that you [ __ ] scumbag

2095.04 --> 2099.119
i

2095.359 --> 2102.56
[ __ ] hate you get a [ __ ] life's

2099.119 --> 2105.04
piece of [ __ ] stop stalking me over the

2102.56 --> 2107.2799999999997
phone you hear me a scumbag

2105.04 --> 2109.359
if you ever face me in real life i'm

2107.28 --> 2110.96
going to [ __ ] help you help you end

2109.359 --> 2116.3199999999997
up in the hospital

2110.96 --> 2118.8
all right you [ __ ] [ __ ]

2116.32 --> 2119.599
right but i'm taking full credit

2118.8 --> 2122.0
together

2119.599 --> 2122.96
absolutely with nathan nathan probably

2122.0 --> 2126.56
deserves more

2122.96 --> 2129.2
because he's just so on point with it

2126.56 --> 2131.599
systems tactics where you don't have to

2129.2 --> 2135.7599999999998
be a mathematical genius

2131.599 --> 2138.7200000000003
like bypassing math giving

2135.76 --> 2139.6800000000003
like people that are not math

2138.72 --> 2142.7999999999997
intellectual

2139.68 --> 2146.48
but more sharpening their intuition

2142.8 --> 2149.119
lower iq people one could say less quick

2146.48 --> 2152.72
in the mind but still good intuition

2149.119 --> 2156.2400000000002
give them sizeable tools that'll work

2152.72 --> 2160.24
every single time you don't have to be

2156.24 --> 2163.2799999999997
smart anymore to swipe the baller

2160.24 --> 2164.8799999999997
blabblers off the table thanks to the

2163.28 --> 2167.2000000000003
development

2164.88 --> 2168.88
and the basically the in the field

2167.2 --> 2171.68
trench research

2168.88 --> 2172.079
that we have been doing every freaking

2171.68 --> 2175.2
day

2172.079 --> 2178.88
for years now yeah

2175.2 --> 2182.96
you don't need to have a freaking degree

2178.88 --> 2186.88
to prove the earth is flat anymore

2182.96 --> 2189.359
you just need to recognize how ballers

2186.88 --> 2191.6800000000003
bring in the machination [ __ ] and

2189.359 --> 2192.56
gaslighting suggestions scattergunning

2191.68 --> 2194.16
straw man

2192.56 --> 2195.599
oh present to math oh where's your

2194.16 --> 2198.56
degree it's all

2195.599 --> 2200.56
[ __ ] it's all distractions scatter

2198.56 --> 2201.52
gunning gaslighting straw manning

2200.56 --> 2204.72
tactics

2201.52 --> 2207.7599999999998
and we know it all we've seen it all

2204.72 --> 2211.4399999999996
right we can literally draw

2207.76 --> 2214.7200000000003
a diagram by now a diagram

2211.44 --> 2218.0
full blown of how ballers

2214.72 --> 2220.7999999999997
respond to facts

2218.0 --> 2222.16
and it would be so amazingly accurate it

2220.8 --> 2224.8
could literally be

2222.16 --> 2227.1189999999997
used as a handbook in psychology for

2224.8 --> 2229.3590000000004
future reference

2227.119 --> 2230.1600000000003
yeah because as i said ballers aren't

2229.359 --> 2233.96
going away

2230.16 --> 2237.359
it's a cult it's a mainstream created

2233.96 --> 2239.839
indoctrination cult and it's not going

2237.359 --> 2241.92
to go away that easily

2239.839 --> 2243.04
so it's good to know it's good to have

2241.92 --> 2246.32
the experience

2243.04 --> 2248.56
dealing with baller psychology

2246.32 --> 2251.2000000000003
right and to understand what they're

2248.56 --> 2251.2
dwelling in

2251.92 --> 2257.839
it's good to know

2269.839 --> 2273.2799999999997
all right i do appreciate some

2271.359 --> 2275.04
assistance here because these [ __ ]

2273.28 --> 2278.48
scumbags

2275.04 --> 2281.52
yeah come to me

2278.48 --> 2283.76
come to me [ __ ] come and face me

2281.52 --> 2285.04
[ __ ] i mean it come to me i don't care

2283.76 --> 2287.3590000000004
if you're [ __ ]

2285.04 --> 2289.92
over two meters tall come to me i will

2287.359 --> 2292.48
[ __ ] kill you you scumbag

2289.92 --> 2294.4
i will [ __ ] rip your [ __ ] head off

2292.48 --> 2297.599
with my bare hands

2294.4 --> 2300.1600000000003
yeah you piece of [ __ ]

2297.599 --> 2300.1600000000003
[ __ ] off

2302.64 --> 2308.56
yeah and and just for for the record

2305.68 --> 2309.2799999999997
yeah seeking star wars yeah i know

2308.56 --> 2312.0789999999997
you're too

2309.28 --> 2312.8
gay and too brainwashed and stupid to

2312.079 --> 2316.6400000000003
know this

2312.8 --> 2317.52
but yeah yeah kids don't come out of

2316.64 --> 2320.0789999999997
your butt

2317.52 --> 2323.04
i know you've been trying a lot they're

2320.079 --> 2325.44
not gonna come out of there

2323.04 --> 2326.4
yeah maybe that's the reason why you why

2325.44 --> 2340.76
it's not working

2326.4 --> 2342.96
for you

2340.76 --> 2347.44
[Music]

2342.96 --> 2347.44
yeah yeah dude that's not gonna work

2347.52 --> 2356.64
[ __ ] off

2354.33 --> 2358.88
[Music]

2356.64 --> 2358.8799999999997
so

2360.32 --> 2369.839
yeah it's it's troll sweeping day

2364.24 --> 2369.839
cockroaches coming out to play

2375.47 --> 2378.5299999999997
[Music]

2382.48 --> 2386.48
can't kill someone who is in the life i

2384.16 --> 2389.52
don't know i think

2386.48 --> 2391.52
this is not fully algorithm driven so

2389.52 --> 2394.079
even though the sock trolls are

2391.52 --> 2396.88
just sock trolls it's coming from a

2394.079 --> 2399.52
person who's a real person

2396.88 --> 2399.52
i can tell

2403.839 --> 2407.2799999999997
now he's absolutely pathetic yeah and i

2406.0 --> 2412.72
know it's he yeah

2407.28 --> 2412.7200000000003
i know absolutely pathetic

2415.45 --> 2420.64
[Music]

2417.44 --> 2424.56
it's not gonna work anyway because yeah

2420.64 --> 2427.44
i'll show my teeth not gonna stay

2424.56 --> 2429.599
angry for you and understand just

2427.44 --> 2430.8
because you're a [ __ ] scumbag that

2429.599 --> 2433.92
deserves to die

2430.8 --> 2437.52
a horrible death for

2433.92 --> 2440.4
your demonic patheticness

2437.52 --> 2442.64
doesn't mean that you can actually

2440.4 --> 2445.52
really pull me out

2442.64 --> 2446.319
right you can't snatch anything from me

2445.52 --> 2449.119
yeah i'll get

2446.319 --> 2451.04
furious for a second then i'll restore

2449.119 --> 2454.4
right back to normal

2451.04 --> 2458.079
because i'm not gonna waste the actual

2454.4 --> 2467.44
energy or actual feelings to a [ __ ]

2458.079 --> 2470.5600000000004
sock troll piece of [ __ ] you understand

2467.44 --> 2474.079
some of us flat earthers got

2470.56 --> 2474.0789999999997
here through eddie ravel

2476.319 --> 2479.7599999999998
so you might be dealing with real

2478.079 --> 2484.1600000000003
killers uh

2479.76 --> 2486.88
what well eddie bravo is a pretty uh

2484.16 --> 2489.2799999999997
yeah he's a pretty powerful dude

2486.88 --> 2493.44
physically absolutely

2489.28 --> 2495.6800000000003
i'm not saying killers right

2493.44 --> 2497.04
when i say that i'm basically trash

2495.68 --> 2498.8799999999997
talking in reality

2497.04 --> 2501.359
it's really not gonna go beyond

2498.88 --> 2503.44
mutilation you know

2501.359 --> 2505.44
they just have to feel it's real and

2503.44 --> 2507.839
start pissing their pants and start

2505.44 --> 2510.079
whimpering like a little baby

2507.839 --> 2512.24
right i don't actually have to kill them

2510.079 --> 2515.44
to make them stop

2512.24 --> 2523.839
but i'll say it like that

2515.44 --> 2523.839
because they have to [ __ ] feel it

2526.4 --> 2528.7200000000003
right

2539.839 --> 2544.7999999999997
right the whole thing is is that they

2543.359 --> 2548.4
just have to learn

2544.8 --> 2550.48
some basic human respect

2548.4 --> 2552.4
basic human respect yeah and for a lot

2550.48 --> 2554.56
of people that's too much to ask because

2552.4 --> 2559.28
they've been raised

2554.56 --> 2562.4
by gay eugenicist anti-human

2559.28 --> 2565.2000000000003
demons dwelling in people

2562.4 --> 2565.92
yeah when you get raised by that you

2565.2 --> 2569.04
don't learn

2565.92 --> 2572.48
any common decency you don't learn

2569.04 --> 2574.72
any normal going about with other people

2572.48 --> 2576.56
and like even learning how to size

2574.72 --> 2577.68
things up because you only learn how to

2576.56 --> 2580.88
size things up

2577.68 --> 2582.24
in order to try and destroy them and you

2580.88 --> 2586.48
think that

2582.24 --> 2590.0
seeing that makes you rich

2586.48 --> 2592.8
makes you more it's really pathetic

2590.0 --> 2597.28
it's like a very pathetic baseline

2592.8 --> 2597.28
predatory mindset that's really not

2604.839 --> 2607.839
effective

2612.4 --> 2623.44
right real media life oh yeah sure

2618.079 --> 2623.44
sure yeah really yeah yeah yeah sure

2623.92 --> 2635.839
why don't you send me an email and i'll

2625.839 --> 2635.839
consider it

2638.96 --> 2647.52
yeah does any of those positions

2642.319 --> 2647.52
also concern flat earth cosmogeny

2647.839 --> 2650.96
and absolutely not politically siding

2650.56 --> 2654.72
with

2650.96 --> 2658.0
anyone oh you're only joking oh you're

2654.72 --> 2658.0
such a special boy

2660.48 --> 2663.839
right so you don't have jobs available

2662.56 --> 2667.119
could it could it be

2663.839 --> 2670.88
real media life suck piece of [ __ ]

2667.119 --> 2672.319
could it be that you don't have a job

2670.88 --> 2675.52
either

2672.319 --> 2677.44
it's actually oh draw flat earthers is

2675.52 --> 2680.16
your job

2677.44 --> 2680.96
or you're just desperately trying to

2680.16 --> 2684.319
suck up

2680.96 --> 2687.52
to some [ __ ] scumbags out there

2684.319 --> 2690.64
that you know have money then hoping

2687.52 --> 2691.2
that just by acting demonic that maybe

2690.64 --> 2695.68
you'll be

2691.2 --> 2698.64
seen maybe the like the bankers whatever

2695.68 --> 2701.44
are going to drop you a little baggie

2698.64 --> 2703.52
is that what you really hope are you

2701.44 --> 2705.2000000000003
actually the one really desperate for a

2703.52 --> 2708.319
job

2705.2 --> 2709.5989999999997
because it seems so you know i have a

2708.319 --> 2712.96
job

2709.599 --> 2716.48
this is my job this is what i do

2712.96 --> 2721.68
i do a live reported hangout i do

2716.48 --> 2721.68
public psychology analysis of my life

2721.76 --> 2727.44
i do cosmogeny i am an

2724.96 --> 2728.319
oracle i get into the spiritual realm

2727.44 --> 2730.8
spiritual

2728.319 --> 2732.0
mechanics right it's not just cosmogenic

2730.8 --> 2734.5600000000004
not just the layout

2732.0 --> 2735.52
of the physical world it's also the

2734.56 --> 2739.44
layout of the

2735.52 --> 2746.079
spiritual realm mechanics right

2739.44 --> 2747.92
basically what do you call that

2746.079 --> 2750.1600000000003
which i don't even know how to classify

2747.92 --> 2750.16
that

2754.319 --> 2763.04
i guess you could say

2758.079 --> 2765.3590000000004
that a spiritual explorer perhaps

2763.04 --> 2766.56
maybe that's a good one yeah it doesn't

2765.359 --> 2769.68
pay very well

2766.56 --> 2772.24
except when it does because i do get

2769.68 --> 2774.72
support from some people that actually

2772.24 --> 2776.64
appreciate what i do

2774.72 --> 2778.8799999999997
and i hope that they can feel that i

2776.64 --> 2781.1189999999997
appreciate them

2778.88 --> 2782.079
right one of these people for example

2781.119 --> 2786.839
being

2782.079 --> 2789.92
stephen dole wait was it stephen don't

2786.839 --> 2793.2
know that's another stephen

2789.92 --> 2793.839
i think that's rasta hat now st uh other

2793.2 --> 2797.04
steven

2793.839 --> 2799.2
uh good servant like he sent me a

2797.04 --> 2801.04
a paypal donation and i know he's not

2799.2 --> 2803.9199999999996
even rich or anything

2801.04 --> 2805.839
he sent it to me he didn't have to but

2803.92 --> 2808.4
he did it because he appreciates me

2805.839 --> 2809.04
right and seeking star wars has given me

2808.4 --> 2814.079
some

2809.04 --> 2816.8
name mind warped in the past too

2814.079 --> 2818.6400000000003
all kinds of people that follow me

2816.8 --> 2821.76
pretty regularly they

2818.64 --> 2824.56
well yeah they do that

2821.76 --> 2826.88
and i get advertisement money so i

2824.56 --> 2830.319
actually do have a job

2826.88 --> 2833.119
and i'm getting around with it

2830.319 --> 2833.7599999999998
and even the funniest part about it is

2833.119 --> 2837.44
it's all

2833.76 --> 2840.48
legal all of it right

2837.44 --> 2842.96
now because we know that on social media

2840.48 --> 2844.319
they typically like to make you do

2842.96 --> 2847.599
things

2844.319 --> 2847.92
get comfortable with it and reporting on

2847.599 --> 2849.92
it

2847.92 --> 2851.52
when it's actually illegal and then they

2849.92 --> 2854.7200000000003
just let you do it

2851.52 --> 2856.64
to kind of build up a case to make you

2854.72 --> 2859.5989999999997
entrap yourself with evidence

2856.64 --> 2861.1189999999997
that you record right well everything

2859.599 --> 2864.1600000000003
that i do

2861.119 --> 2867.599
is legal everything

2864.16 --> 2870.3999999999996
everything about it is legal right

2867.599 --> 2870.96
and i have an income yeah it's not it's

2870.4 --> 2874.079
not as

2870.96 --> 2876.16
really awesome high paying job but it's

2874.079 --> 2878.48
worth it

2876.16 --> 2879.52
i'm developing i'm getting better at it

2878.48 --> 2882.64
i'm getting some

2879.52 --> 2885.119
name for good and for bad

2882.64 --> 2885.1189999999997
i guess

2885.839 --> 2890.7999999999997
and yeah i'm still i'm still relatively

2889.28 --> 2892.7200000000003
healthy

2890.8 --> 2894.1600000000003
despite some stress issues but that's

2892.72 --> 2897.839
personal that's

2894.16 --> 2901.7599999999998
what's always going to happen and

2897.839 --> 2903.92
i still eat organic very strictly

2901.76 --> 2905.6800000000003
and it's going great yeah all these

2903.92 --> 2908.96
things with this

2905.68 --> 2912.0789999999997
no job right this no

2908.96 --> 2915.52
job life that i have the no job

2912.079 --> 2916.559
life that the trolls like to remind me

2915.52 --> 2919.839
of oh i've saw

2916.559 --> 2922.3190000000004
such a no job yeah well i am eating

2919.839 --> 2924.48
organic i am getting around i still

2922.319 --> 2926.0
do smoke some cannabis here and there i

2924.48 --> 2929.119
can even afford that

2926.0 --> 2932.88
barely but it's working

2929.119 --> 2935.92
because i have such a no job

2932.88 --> 2938.48
right because trust me

2935.92 --> 2939.2000000000003
just getting social welfare i wouldn't

2938.48 --> 2942.079
be doing

2939.2 --> 2943.359
i wouldn't be able to do any of this

2942.079 --> 2946.2400000000002
yeah

2943.359 --> 2948.16
i was on social welfare before i got

2946.24 --> 2951.9199999999996
into doing this

2948.16 --> 2954.16
and it was a lot more problematic and

2951.92 --> 2956.64
stressful financially

2954.16 --> 2958.0
because sometimes i really didn't have

2956.64 --> 2961.359
anything to eat like

2958.0 --> 2962.72
nothing absolutely nothing well those

2961.359 --> 2967.04
types of

2962.72 --> 2969.4399999999996
days haven't come back in years now

2967.04 --> 2973.2
thanks to well this setup what i got

2969.44 --> 2973.2000000000003
right here and it's working just great

2980.559 --> 2984.559
yeah that's really cute yeah i talk

2983.04 --> 2989.839
about things that are

2984.559 --> 2989.8390000000004
real constantly constantly

2990.88 --> 2995.44
and you don't have to sell it it's just

2993.839 --> 2998.7999999999997
there

2995.44 --> 3002.8
i just share it people talk about it i

2998.8 --> 3007.119
point at things they don't see

3002.8 --> 3007.119
and then upgrade it for everyone

3007.2 --> 3013.839
if they have the eyes to see what i

3009.599 --> 3013.839
pointed out

3017.44 --> 3020.8
hello william double j

3025.599 --> 3029.04
well seeking star wars it's not even

3027.599 --> 3032.96
that you know at this point

3029.04 --> 3036.72
flat earth is real it's very basic

3032.96 --> 3037.359
it's not difficult for the brain to

3036.72 --> 3039.9199999999996
grasp

3037.359 --> 3042.4
you know that the earth is flat is not

3039.92 --> 3046.48
the difficult part

3042.4 --> 3046.96
the difficult part is waking up from the

3046.48 --> 3051.28
fact

3046.96 --> 3054.7200000000003
that you've entrusted your intellectual

3051.28 --> 3055.76
grasp of things on a group that has

3054.72 --> 3058.72
literally turned

3055.76 --> 3059.76
everything inside out and that that

3058.72 --> 3063.359
worked

3059.76 --> 3065.5200000000004
that it worked that's the biggest shock

3063.359 --> 3066.88
the biggest shock is realizing that

3065.52 --> 3069.7599999999998
you're in a beast system

3066.88 --> 3071.119
and that it works that it turned the

3069.76 --> 3074.48
image around

3071.119 --> 3074.48
and you defended it

3074.559 --> 3078.2400000000002
that's the biggest shock it's not the

3077.04 --> 3080.4
mechanics of

3078.24 --> 3082.64
the earth being flat right it's not that

3080.4 --> 3085.76
difficult at all

3082.64 --> 3088.4
like it really isn't no

3085.76 --> 3090.4
the difficult part is realizing that

3088.4 --> 3093.04
you've been lied to

3090.4 --> 3094.4
since perhaps birth and that even your

3093.04 --> 3097.839
parents perhaps

3094.4 --> 3098.64
might not even known that it was going

3097.839 --> 3101.599
on that

3098.64 --> 3103.7599999999998
everybody got gets trapped in this

3101.599 --> 3106.8
system of lies and revert will

3103.76 --> 3109.2000000000003
reversed world reality that's

3106.8 --> 3110.0
the shocking part the waking up to that

3109.2 --> 3113.1189999999997
that's the

3110.0 --> 3115.44
this spiritual visceral thing that

3113.119 --> 3116.4
really freaks you out that hurts and

3115.44 --> 3119.2000000000003
that when people

3116.4 --> 3120.7200000000003
turn to flat earth when they find out

3119.2 --> 3123.04
and they really start to learn about it

3120.72 --> 3126.319
that's why they often have like a month

3123.04 --> 3129.44
or multiple months of sleepless nights

3126.319 --> 3130.64
it's not because oh it's so difficult to

3129.44 --> 3134.079
understand the flare

3130.64 --> 3136.8799999999997
no it's because of their

3134.079 --> 3138.48
personal involvement in reality what it

3136.88 --> 3143.119
turns out to be that's

3138.48 --> 3153.839
the shocking part it's not the geometry

3143.119 --> 3153.839
of the cosmogeny

3160.64 --> 3165.7599999999998
great youtube's over a minute behind now

3165.119 --> 3168.6400000000003
i have to see

3165.76 --> 3168.6400000000003
myself get all

3170.0 --> 3175.68
flapping around with hands like a muppet

3173.599 --> 3181.839
i do have that thing where i flap around

3175.68 --> 3181.839
with my hands like a muppet

3184.72 --> 3195.839
that's part of like the silly act of

3187.2 --> 3195.839
people getting really active and stupid

3223.68 --> 3237.839
what color was what

3245.76 --> 3250.0
social blade i've heard of that i don't

3248.72 --> 3253.839
even know what that is tiny

3250.0 --> 3253.839
one well what is that social blade

3258.079 --> 3262.559
let me google it like a pro

3262.88 --> 3266.7200000000003
what the [ __ ] is social blade

3266.96 --> 3270.7200000000003
all right statistics thing right i

3269.52 --> 3278.24
thought i recognized it

3270.72 --> 3293.839
nathan brought it up one time

3278.24 --> 3293.839
all right

3294.88 --> 3298.1600000000003
hello matthew eastman

3302.16 --> 3305.5989999999997
it's quite useful to see how are you

3303.76 --> 3308.7990000000004
doing well for me

3305.599 --> 3312.559
yeah look i just check

3308.799 --> 3315.04
the views like i basically check

3312.559 --> 3317.3590000000004
everything from my youtube channel

3315.04 --> 3321.839
when it comes to financial issues and

3317.359 --> 3321.839
all that

3324.72 --> 3330.16
know as i've told many times before i

3328.16 --> 3335.839
effectively don't really get anything

3330.16 --> 3335.839
from that anyway

3354.64 --> 3362.5589999999997
yeah doing good tiny wumbo started out a

3358.319 --> 3364.88
little pissed off today but i'm doing

3362.559 --> 3364.88
good

3365.119 --> 3370.88
it's just that i get kind of sick of

3367.359 --> 3370.88
youtube sometimes and just

3371.92 --> 3377.92
the format maintenance

3375.28 --> 3379.0400000000004
the decisions that have been made it's

3377.92 --> 3381.92
terrible

3379.04 --> 3384.88
and just like it's become a shittier

3381.92 --> 3384.88
place because of it

3385.599 --> 3389.04
sock trolls are having a time of their

3388.559 --> 3392.88
life

3389.04 --> 3398.4
like pieces of [ __ ] are using

3392.88 --> 3398.4
the crappy decisions that youtube makes

3400.48 --> 3404.0
right so whatever they're doing it's not

3403.28 --> 3407.3590000000004
leading to

3404.0 --> 3408.72
an actual improvement like of the

3407.359 --> 3411.839
platform itself

3408.72 --> 3414.0
you know not everything is just about

3411.839 --> 3415.599
how flow charts will work on the

3414.0 --> 3418.24
technical system sometimes

3415.599 --> 3420.799
it's also just what's actually happening

3418.24 --> 3420.799
out there

3427.68 --> 3435.2799999999997
and yeah what functions do you need

3432.319 --> 3436.0
and getting in a chat and being able to

3435.28 --> 3438.48
trace

3436.0 --> 3439.92
who somebody is what their original

3438.48 --> 3442.88
youtube account is

3439.92 --> 3444.16
is invaluable it's incredibly valuable

3442.88 --> 3447.359
it was like the best

3444.16 --> 3449.359
function youtube had

3447.359 --> 3451.52
it was the best thing about the whole

3449.359 --> 3461.839
thing that they had that and they

3451.52 --> 3461.839
freaking took it away it's a crime

3469.28 --> 3475.76
my osd is go what it's not the wrong way

3472.96 --> 3478.96
around

3475.76 --> 3482.2400000000002
it was two days ago by the way but

3478.96 --> 3489.839
it's not the wrong way around yeah

3482.24 --> 3489.839
that will right the way it should be

3492.59 --> 3499.3790000000004
[Music]

3500.319 --> 3504.4
but you also see why they took it away

3502.72 --> 3506.9599999999996
why tiny womble

3504.4 --> 3517.839
why why did they take it away what do

3506.96 --> 3517.839
you see

3525.359 --> 3530.24
like look if they had issues with for

3528.88 --> 3532.96
example

3530.24 --> 3536.4799999999996
trolls quickly make stock accounts go

3532.96 --> 3539.52
about anonymous and then stock people

3536.48 --> 3542.359
yeah it's annoying if

3539.52 --> 3544.48
anybody could do that well they have

3542.359 --> 3547.359
compartmentalized functions

3544.48 --> 3548.88
already like for a moderator for a

3547.359 --> 3552.16
channel owner

3548.88 --> 3556.319
the options can be different per default

3552.16 --> 3559.68
so why not use the go to

3556.319 --> 3562.24
channel function

3559.68 --> 3565.359
in the drop down menu of when you hover

3562.24 --> 3568.24
over the three dots of somebody in chat

3565.359 --> 3569.5989999999997
why don't you then just leave go to

3568.24 --> 3573.68
channel

3569.599 --> 3576.7200000000003
for moderators and channel owners

3573.68 --> 3580.319
and not for just anyone

3576.72 --> 3583.1189999999997
how difficult can that be right

3580.319 --> 3584.839
i think i suggested this year over a

3583.119 --> 3587.839
year ago

3584.839 --> 3587.839
even

3603.92 --> 3607.28
privacy issues my guess a lot of kids

3606.4 --> 3609.76
with youtube

3607.28 --> 3611.119
well george sanford then it only is even

3609.76 --> 3614.7990000000004
more important

3611.119 --> 3616.48
to be able to do that right because if

3614.799 --> 3620.0
so if somebody's a kid

3616.48 --> 3624.4
or acting like they're an adult

3620.0 --> 3627.28
but they're actually a kid or whatever

3624.4 --> 3628.64
it's kind of good to know whose account

3627.28 --> 3631.2000000000003
it is

3628.64 --> 3633.2799999999997
what the situation is and all that right

3631.2 --> 3635.52
it's even more important to identify

3633.28 --> 3635.52
them

3640.88 --> 3645.28
but yes if it is taken away because of

3644.0 --> 3648.64
bullying

3645.28 --> 3651.76
i totally get that yeah truck stalkers

3648.64 --> 3654.5589999999997
stalker trolls piling on right

3651.76 --> 3658.2400000000002
especially to newbies right of course

3654.559 --> 3662.6400000000003
so then make it an option only

3658.24 --> 3668.24
for moderators and channel owners

3662.64 --> 3668.24
how hard can it be shouldn't be that

3668.839 --> 3671.839
hard

3683.359 --> 3687.839
all right so i'm glad you're agreeing

3685.359 --> 3691.839
with me about that tiny womble

3687.839 --> 3695.119
if you could pass on the idea

3691.839 --> 3697.7599999999998
to somebody who knows who's actually

3695.119 --> 3699.839
having some influence on who makes the

3697.76 --> 3704.1600000000003
decisions about this that will be great

3699.839 --> 3704.16
whatever or spread the idea around just

3707.44 --> 3710.7200000000003
right it would be great if something

3710.16 --> 3713.839
would be

3710.72 --> 3713.839
would be done

3717.119 --> 3721.92
oh australia vaccine just got banned

3719.68 --> 3721.9199999999996
good

3722.24 --> 3725.68
now if they only just banded for

3724.48 --> 3729.68
everybody above

3725.68 --> 3731.839
30 as well then things will be alright

3729.68 --> 3733.359
should just be banned just the entire

3731.839 --> 3737.0389999999998
thing completely banned

3733.359 --> 3740.16
masks banned tests banned

3737.039 --> 3744.559
tracers banned all of it banned banned

3740.16 --> 3744.5589999999997
made illegal i think literally

3752.839 --> 3757.44
like

3754.96 --> 3760.16
i don't know it's it's difficult to say

3757.44 --> 3763.76
also what the consequence would be but

3760.16 --> 3766.64
i think like the covet situation

3763.76 --> 3767.599
should be internationally recognized for

3766.64 --> 3771.359
what it is

3767.599 --> 3774.7200000000003
a medical industrial scam

3771.359 --> 3776.64
based on the rearranging of what is

3774.72 --> 3777.5989999999997
actually understood about the medical

3776.64 --> 3780.96
system

3777.599 --> 3782.079
about what a cold is what what the flu

3780.96 --> 3784.7200000000003
is how that actually

3782.079 --> 3785.44
works versus the models they're applying

3784.72 --> 3788.64
for this

3785.44 --> 3792.48
scenario the supposed pandemic scenario

3788.64 --> 3795.68
and i think that at some point if this

3792.48 --> 3800.48
is not gonna stop sooner or later

3795.68 --> 3804.3999999999996
just it should be made illegal

3800.48 --> 3807.76
to advertise pro-covet things

3804.4 --> 3811.28
like it should be made illegal for like

3807.76 --> 3813.2000000000003
corporations and anything to say that

3811.28 --> 3815.119
to basically say no wear mask wear a

3813.2 --> 3819.0389999999998
mask to literally make that

3815.119 --> 3823.039
illegal because you're contributing

3819.039 --> 3823.039
to a conspiracy

3823.119 --> 3829.2000000000003
to damage and kill the people

3827.839 --> 3833.0389999999998
it's a medical threat you're

3829.2 --> 3836.839
contributing to medical threat

3833.039 --> 3839.76
medical mind control terrorism one could

3836.839 --> 3842.4
argue make it illegal

3839.76 --> 3843.8390000000004
yeah i know i'm i'm really kind of a

3842.4 --> 3846.559
hardcore like that

3843.839 --> 3848.24
just i'm just really sick of it and i

3846.559 --> 3849.92
know they're not gonna stop it's just

3848.24 --> 3851.2799999999997
gonna keep on pushing and pushing and

3849.92 --> 3854.319
pushing and hoping that

3851.28 --> 3857.6800000000003
the sheer atrocity

3854.319 --> 3860.079
of it all is going to make

3857.68 --> 3861.96
you and everybody else even the ones

3860.079 --> 3865.119
that know it's fake

3861.96 --> 3868.48
normalize that they do that

3865.119 --> 3871.839
and i don't want to accept that

3868.48 --> 3875.44
i think it should be made illegal

3871.839 --> 3879.2
right like if

3875.44 --> 3879.839
mind conf that book kind of a stupid

3879.2 --> 3882.8799999999997
book

3879.839 --> 3885.119
in many ways if it is illegal

3882.88 --> 3887.52
right if that's already the case if it's

3885.119 --> 3890.28
illegal in certain countries

3887.52 --> 3892.4
well why don't you put covid

3890.28 --> 3895.44
advertisement

3892.4 --> 3899.28
pandemic fake advertisement

3895.44 --> 3903.119
medical scams why don't you put

3899.28 --> 3907.3590000000004
that narrative in the same camp

3903.119 --> 3909.76
you say no this is illegal now

3907.359 --> 3911.839
if you're going to talk about that [ __ ]

3909.76 --> 3912.7990000000004
on the radio encourage people to wear

3911.839 --> 3915.839
their masks

3912.799 --> 3919.7599999999998
you're going to be arrested

3915.839 --> 3919.7599999999998
huh how about that

3919.92 --> 3925.359
i think his things are going to be over

3921.599 --> 3925.3590000000004
pretty quick then don't you think

3928.96 --> 3932.96
i know it sounds kind of like over the

3931.599 --> 3936.4
top doesn't it

3932.96 --> 3939.44
it really does it sounds ridiculous and

3936.4 --> 3941.28
oh but all those poor people that

3939.44 --> 3941.92
believe it yeah why do you think they

3941.28 --> 3944.3590000000004
believe it

3941.92 --> 3946.079
because it's being literally

3944.359 --> 3949.52
indoctrinated

3946.079 --> 3952.0
everywhere freaking radio for

3949.52 --> 3955.119
financial incentives or people just

3952.0 --> 3958.72
gullible enough to believe that [ __ ]

3955.119 --> 3962.48
should be made illegal

3958.72 --> 3966.16
pandemic promotion covet

3962.48 --> 3968.559
promotion should be made illegal

3966.16 --> 3970.319
fairporting oh everybody's getting it

3968.559 --> 3973.3590000000004

3976.839 --> 3982.96
primary

3978.72 --> 3982.9599999999996

3984.88 --> 3993.839
just ban it no more

3988.079 --> 3996.88
advertisement for pandemic medical scams

3993.839 --> 3996.88
make it illegal

3997.359 --> 4000.5589999999997
and hey if they're not gonna stop then

4000.24 --> 4003.839
just

4000.559 --> 4006.6400000000003
up the punishment some more

4003.839 --> 4008.64
right it's like no you are going to stop

4006.64 --> 4011.5989999999997
this [ __ ] scam right now

4008.64 --> 4013.68
you are going to stop driving people

4011.599 --> 4016.799
into freaking killing themselves

4013.68 --> 4019.359
literally sometimes or indirectly

4016.799 --> 4020.0
you're going to stop helping that you're

4019.359 --> 4022.5589999999997
going to do

4020.0 --> 4022.559
that now

4024.559 --> 4030.799
how do you do that by making it illegal

4027.72 --> 4034.5589999999997
illegal to advertise

4030.799 --> 4039.359
pro pandemic scam [ __ ]

4034.559 --> 4039.3590000000004
on media make it illegal

4047.52 --> 4049.839
all right

4058.48 --> 4066.0
and at this point i have to say that any

4062.64 --> 4067.1189999999997
any group in the world any group any

4066.0 --> 4070.96
group

4067.119 --> 4074.0
that's going to side with that idea

4070.96 --> 4075.76
like make pandemic promotion mask

4074.0 --> 4079.2
wearing

4075.76 --> 4083.599
vaccine pushing make it illegal

4079.2 --> 4086.0789999999997
under criminal response punishment

4083.599 --> 4086.799
right i'm going to promote them no

4086.079 --> 4090.079
matter

4086.799 --> 4092.24
who they are no matter who they

4090.079 --> 4092.2400000000002
are

4094.88 --> 4104.400000000001
if you do that no matter how [ __ ]

4097.92 --> 4107.359
crazy or evil once or whatever you are

4104.4 --> 4107.3589999999995
it should be done

4107.52 --> 4110.799000000001
pandemic promotion mask wearing

4110.08 --> 4113.839
promotion

4110.799 --> 4118.4
vaccine taking promotion

4113.839 --> 4122.48
fear spreading statistical lying

4118.4 --> 4124.96
about covet cases and deaths

4122.48 --> 4126.04
and the promotion and the hype thereof

4124.96 --> 4133.839
should be made

4126.04 --> 4133.839
illegal completely

4143.26 --> 4146.299
[Music]

4147.04 --> 4150.799
ah it's so good to say that

4154.159 --> 4161.839
feels so good saying that

4172.839 --> 4175.839
hmm

4215.199 --> 4220.96
huh well matthew eastman

4218.88 --> 4222.08
why didn't it go up well that's too

4220.96 --> 4224.96
complicated

4222.08 --> 4226.08
in ways crime has gone up because people

4224.96 --> 4229.6
are wearing a mask

4226.08 --> 4232.8
because they're they're causing

4229.6 --> 4236.88
an average derangement because of

4232.8 --> 4239.76
hypoxia and because bacterial

4236.88 --> 4241.1990000000005
pneumonia and all the combined average

4239.76 --> 4245.280000000001
influences causes

4241.199 --> 4248.799999999999
people to become more deranged

4245.28 --> 4250.8
leading to more crime at the same time

4248.8 --> 4251.52
there's the average influence of people

4250.8 --> 4253.6
just

4251.52 --> 4255.84
getting numbed down because of the

4253.6 --> 4258.0
hypoxia so in that sense it kind of

4255.84 --> 4262.719
evens it out perhaps

4258.0 --> 4265.92
it's kind of difficult to lay that

4262.719 --> 4265.92
connection like that

4266.48 --> 4269.599999999999
so many influences

4271.52 --> 4274.64
shut up mom patrol

4284.0 --> 4288.08
right yeah and there's that as well

4286.0 --> 4290.159
seeking star wars indeed no stores are

4288.08 --> 4301.84
open to rob

4290.159 --> 4301.839999999999
especially the small ones right

4307.44 --> 4310.879999999999
seems like a golden age for criminal

4309.199 --> 4315.839999999999
well

4310.88 --> 4315.84
no no it's not

4319.84 --> 4325.6
like the golden age for criminals is

4322.88 --> 4326.96
when society thrives when there's a lot

4325.6 --> 4329.92
of money being made

4326.96 --> 4331.12
that's the golden age for criminals

4329.92 --> 4333.36
unless they also get

4331.12 --> 4335.599999999999
extra cracked down upon but it's look if

4333.36 --> 4338.0
nobody's making money if nobody's doing

4335.6 --> 4342.0
business if there's no commerce

4338.0 --> 4345.44
then crime is not as profitable either

4342.0 --> 4349.199
on average it's just a natural fact

4345.44 --> 4351.5199999999995
no prosperity no profits from crime

4349.199 --> 4351.5199999999995
either

4352.159 --> 4361.759999999999
right people need money

4356.48 --> 4363.199
to to steal as it were

4361.76 --> 4371.84
they don't have anything yeah what are

4363.199 --> 4371.839999999999
you gonna steal right

4378.0 --> 4382.4
ah right yeah monk patrol but that's

4380.64 --> 4385.52
different

4382.4 --> 4386.239
wearing masks in bangkok yeah in china

4385.52 --> 4388.2390000000005
where there's

4386.239 --> 4389.44
severe dust issues that's different

4388.239 --> 4393.678999999999
because

4389.44 --> 4396.639999999999
dust is actually blocked by masks

4393.679 --> 4398.719
so yeah that does actually help them

4396.64 --> 4401.52
compared to those who don't

4398.719 --> 4402.4800000000005
wear it right but they don't wear it

4401.52 --> 4405.6
inside their

4402.48 --> 4407.839999999999
car they don't work wear it

4405.6 --> 4410.159000000001
inside their working building that has

4407.84 --> 4413.4400000000005
their own air filters

4410.159 --> 4416.719
right they wear it outside

4413.44 --> 4420.5599999999995
where the dust's going around right

4416.719 --> 4423.679
they don't go like a bunch of idiots

4420.56 --> 4428.159000000001
in the cove situation wearing two

4423.679 --> 4428.159
masks in their car just

4430.8 --> 4436.08
right because bangkok people are not

4433.28 --> 4436.08
[ __ ]

4436.48 --> 4445.759999999999
at least not in that sort of way

4440.56 --> 4445.76
not like that they're not that stupid

4446.64 --> 4458.2390000000005
they have other issues

4455.12 --> 4460.08
have i ever been to thailand nope i've

4458.239 --> 4462.32
had i've known people that went there

4460.08 --> 4462.32
though

4466.719 --> 4469.84
but yeah

4470.159 --> 4474.239
i know in asian countries they do have

4472.56 --> 4476.8
typically

4474.239 --> 4478.799999999999
dust pollution and all that those types

4476.8 --> 4480.2390000000005
of problems in bigger cities and they do

4478.8 --> 4483.84
wear masks

4480.239 --> 4483.839999999999
because of that

4485.04 --> 4497.84
they don't wear them inside their car

4487.6 --> 4497.84
and all that [ __ ]

4499.84 --> 4505.84
what there is no fe here what are you

4503.199 --> 4505.839999999999
talking about

4506.64 --> 4511.84
wasn't eric the bay in thailand

4520.159 --> 4525.839999999999
maybe you forgot that part

4525.92 --> 4539.84
right guys eric debay was in thailand

4528.4 --> 4539.839999999999
wasn't he

4543.52 --> 4550.64
oh thai people oh

4546.8 --> 4553.1990000000005
so you're being a racist aren't you

4550.64 --> 4556.400000000001
yeah you don't know do you speak tai

4553.199 --> 4556.4

now if you were a baller and you would

4559.199 --> 4562.4
inquire they would just tell yeah yeah

4560.8 --> 4564.88

4562.4 --> 4567.839999999999
to deal with [ __ ] ballers

4564.88 --> 4567.84
because they have a life

4569.52 --> 4573.360000000001
i'll bet you there's plenty of flat

4571.52 --> 4575.1990000000005
earthers among thai people

4573.36 --> 4576.4
they're just gonna keep it to themselves

4575.199 --> 4578.48
because they know

4576.4 --> 4579.839999999999
how [ __ ] up the ballers can get and

4578.48 --> 4580.639999999999
they don't want to get involved with

4579.84 --> 4595.84
that

4580.64 --> 4595.84
totally get it

4605.92 --> 4612.08
search for effie tai chan now

4609.52 --> 4612.080000000001
that's fine

4612.8 --> 4615.4400000000005
i'm good

4617.679 --> 4621.52
but i know there's flat earthers just

4620.08 --> 4624.88
all over the place

4621.52 --> 4628.159000000001
like everywhere in the world it's

4624.88 --> 4630.4800000000005
but it's too much also like

4628.159 --> 4632.48
they're all separated doing their own

4630.48 --> 4634.4
thing

4632.48 --> 4637.36
you can't really put them together it

4634.4 --> 4639.839999999999
wouldn't work together

4637.36 --> 4641.679
but there's a whole bunch of people that

4639.84 --> 4644.2390000000005
have taken note of flutter that

4641.679 --> 4645.679
are forming their own little debating

4644.239 --> 4649.12
groups and

4645.679 --> 4652.4800000000005
pondering it and figuring things out

4649.12 --> 4655.679
all over the world every language i bet

4652.48 --> 4655.678999999999
there's flat earthers

4663.76 --> 4668.400000000001
all right yeah mandy young yeah over

4666.88 --> 4669.36
here too you know in the netherlands

4668.4 --> 4672.4
they do it too

4669.36 --> 4672.4
it's so embarrassing

4672.64 --> 4679.04
like i'd see like old men like

4675.92 --> 4681.28
deep in their 60s just wearing a mask

4679.04 --> 4682.719
in their car with closed windows and i'm

4681.28 --> 4686.5599999999995

4825.28 --> 4833.84
can count on one hand the times that i

4828.4 --> 4833.839999999999

4849.679 --> 4854.4800000000005
oh that's so awesome that's so awesome

4852.48 --> 4855.759999999999
they actually say it seeking star wars

4854.48 --> 4859.28
that they actually

4855.76 --> 4862.56
say yay i can see your face

4859.28 --> 4866.08
because over here

4862.56 --> 4866.400000000001

see

4866.4 --> 4870.638999999999
my face and that i don't wear a mask and

4868.56 --> 4874.0
hey i'm not ugly and [ __ ]

4870.639 --> 4875.92
alright for the ladies

4874.0 --> 4880.239
so they are i know they're happy about

4875.92 --> 4880.2390000000005
it but they don't say it though

4882.56 --> 4886.84
right but i haven't had any karen that

4884.8 --> 4889.76
we're like hey you're very messed

4886.84 --> 4892.719
no no

4889.76 --> 4894.400000000001
but then again they know if they would

4892.719 --> 4898.32
bring up that attitude i

4894.4 --> 4898.32
will like tense up

4899.199 --> 4905.839999999999
and they won't like that

4902.8 --> 4907.04
they either yeah so i know i don't get

4905.84 --> 4917.84
karen's after me

4907.04 --> 4917.84
for that

4928.4 --> 4931.36
glaze your park

4933.36 --> 4945.839999999999
ah that sounds amazing

4957.28 --> 4973.84
all right tiny wumbo good to hear

4981.12 --> 4985.36
oh it's kind of funny you know it's it's

4983.6 --> 4989.360000000001
been a while now like

4985.36 --> 4992.88
oh [ __ ] uh

4989.36 --> 4992.88
is it over a year already

4993.12 --> 5000.48
with the masks no it was like last

4997.92 --> 5001.84
december right so it's not been that

5000.48 --> 5005.919999999999
long

5001.84 --> 5008.2390000000005
i think no no wait last year was a whole

5005.92 --> 5010.4
year was the freaking mask situation

5008.239 --> 5013.36
right so it's all been already like one

5010.4 --> 5018.638999999999
and a half years sheesh

5013.36 --> 5023.04
but i'm starting to notice that

5018.639 --> 5025.04
like people don't ask me to like

5023.04 --> 5028.48
you're not wearing a mask they don't do

5025.04 --> 5031.5199999999995
that in the beginning they kind of did

5028.48 --> 5032.159
but it was also because i was nervous

5031.52 --> 5036.080000000001
about it

5032.159 --> 5038.08
because i was afraid in relation to the

5036.08 --> 5039.04
mask and afraid like i don't want to

5038.08 --> 5042.639
wear it

5039.04 --> 5045.92
now like i kind of like completely

5042.639 --> 5046.639
sidestepped it and i'm just not wearing

5045.92 --> 5048.96
a mask

5046.639 --> 5050.0
and i'm not nervous about it and it's

5048.96 --> 5054.2390000000005
like yeah

5050.0 --> 5056.719
i'm literally radiating this is normal

5054.239 --> 5058.959999999999
like this is normal people putting on

5056.719 --> 5060.88
masks are actually crazy

5058.96 --> 5062.719
but i get it they're totally

5060.88 --> 5064.159000000001
indoctrinated i won't be able to get

5062.719 --> 5065.04
through to them it's going to take a

5064.159 --> 5066.879999999999
long time to

5065.04 --> 5069.199
even try to reach them in their

5066.88 --> 5072.639
understanding about it

5069.199 --> 5073.12
but because of this difference and just

5072.639 --> 5076.08
this

5073.12 --> 5077.04
natural look on me like i'm not

5076.08 --> 5079.92
responding to

5077.04 --> 5081.36
anything concerning the mass condition

5079.92 --> 5082.639
people tell me to wear a mask i

5081.36 --> 5086.48
literally look like

5082.639 --> 5088.4800000000005
uh no and

5086.48 --> 5091.12
like how many times until this even been

5088.48 --> 5092.959999999999
asked like maybe five times in like over

5091.12 --> 5096.4
a year

5092.96 --> 5100.719
and now they don't ask anymore

5096.4 --> 5103.12
not even if they haven't seen me before

5100.719 --> 5104.0
they don't ask because they look at me

5103.12 --> 5109.12
and they see

5104.0 --> 5112.56
that's a guy that's not wearing a mask

5109.12 --> 5115.12
just let's move on and it works it's

5112.56 --> 5116.56
working it works great i'm really happy

5115.12 --> 5120.08
about it

5116.56 --> 5123.76
i'm satisfied about that because

5120.08 --> 5126.0
at first it was getting to me

5123.76 --> 5127.92
like it was unnerving to me that people

5126.0 --> 5130.4
would ask me to wear a mask i thought it

5127.92 --> 5133.28
was really unnerving

5130.4 --> 5134.879999999999
but i gotta got over it now i'm just not

5133.28 --> 5136.96
afraid anymore

5134.88 --> 5138.2390000000005
and i don't have this nervousness i

5136.96 --> 5141.44
don't have the fear

5138.239 --> 5144.239
even even for other people

5141.44 --> 5146.0
what might happen to them is or anything

5144.239 --> 5148.159
no fear of the vaccine

5146.0 --> 5150.159
like it's never going to happen if they

5148.159 --> 5151.199
are technically going to force it that's

5150.159 --> 5154.08
literally just

5151.199 --> 5154.638999999999
war then so i don't have to worry about

5154.08 --> 5156.239
it because

5154.639 --> 5157.679
if that's gonna happen everything's

5156.239 --> 5160.32
gonna be [ __ ] anyway

5157.679 --> 5161.92
so i don't have to worry about it

5160.32 --> 5165.36
because they can't do it

5161.92 --> 5169.4400000000005
that's literally just and yeah

5165.36 --> 5172.799999999999
that's the threshold they can't go past

5169.44 --> 5174.719
right they can endlessly try to convince

5172.8 --> 5176.56
you that that is the case

5174.719 --> 5178.639
and that you're supposed to take it and

5176.56 --> 5181.280000000001
all that they can endlessly try to

5178.639 --> 5183.92
indoctrinate you they can never force it

5181.28 --> 5185.5199999999995
never it just seems more obvious that

5183.92 --> 5187.92
they can never do that

5185.52 --> 5188.719
because if they did they would go over a

5187.92 --> 5192.8
threshold

5188.719 --> 5197.04
that's just going to absolutely detonate

5192.8 --> 5200.159000000001
everything it's just gonna be

5197.04 --> 5202.239
yeah that they will

5200.159 --> 5204.638999999999
guarantee they're guaranteed to lose

5202.239 --> 5207.599999999999
complete control if they do that

5204.639 --> 5209.12
that's why they're not doing that that's

5207.6 --> 5210.08
why they're taking the long route and

5209.12 --> 5213.12
just trying to

5210.08 --> 5214.96
gaslight everybody in that it's mandated

5213.12 --> 5216.5599999999995
and that you have no choice and that

5214.96 --> 5218.719
you're going to have to do it

5216.56 --> 5220.2390000000005
one time anyway or you'll not be able to

5218.719 --> 5222.88
do anything blah blah blah

5220.239 --> 5225.199
endless convincing endless endless

5222.88 --> 5228.159000000001
suggesting seduction convincing

5225.199 --> 5230.799999999999
threatening all these things they can't

5228.159 --> 5233.839999999999
actually force it

5230.8 --> 5237.04
because if they did it's just it's over

5233.84 --> 5239.84
everything everything would be over very

5237.04 --> 5239.84
quick

5240.28 --> 5243.37
[Music]

5249.11 --> 5253.839999999999
[Music]

5250.84 --> 5253.84
ah

5259.04 --> 5263.36
what you couldn't wear jeans in a

5261.84 --> 5281.84
nightclub what

5263.36 --> 5281.839999999999
what is that that sounds weird

5295.76 --> 5299.4400000000005
okay mind warped what

5299.92 --> 5309.84
yeah that's pretty decent dutch i don't

5302.8 --> 5309.84
know why

5319.28 --> 5324.239
okay are you are you learning dutch

5324.32 --> 5328.719
is this really you or did you just use a

5326.719 --> 5332.08
translator and just

5328.719 --> 5333.52
copied it do you understand what you're

5332.08 --> 5337.84
actually saying there in dutch

5333.52 --> 5337.84
mind warp

5357.52 --> 5366.159000000001
huh okay tiny bumble just goes to show

5362.159 --> 5370.159
like my uh my rollerblading lore

5366.159 --> 5373.12
is not high enough to even know that

5370.159 --> 5376.08
guess what this guy's never been to a

5373.12 --> 5376.08
nightclub before

5376.84 --> 5379.84
ever

5398.0 --> 5407.84
what is mimed warmth saying well

5408.4 --> 5412.839999999999
okay well the first one he's basically

5411.679 --> 5416.0
saying he had a

5412.84 --> 5418.88
diagnosis from a king

5416.0 --> 5422.239
which is a very weird thing to say with

5418.88 --> 5422.2390000000005
photographic memory

5424.719 --> 5433.199
and then just a personal anecdote

5429.28 --> 5433.199
i thought everyone was like me

5433.6 --> 5440.719
this was since i was a child

5437.92 --> 5441.92
it's it's it's slightly incorrect

5440.719 --> 5445.28
doesn't matter

5441.92 --> 5446.88
i don't know it does sound very typical

5445.28 --> 5449.84
dutch

5446.88 --> 5449.84
and he said

5450.88 --> 5459.1990000000005
in dutch so people don't get it

5456.0 --> 5459.199
it's still new to me

5460.0 --> 5465.12
he only speaks a little dutch he's

5462.639 --> 5469.28
actually

5465.12 --> 5472.08
swiss german because he lived there for

5469.28 --> 5472.08
a period

5472.48 --> 5479.28
right right i was wondering

5476.4 --> 5480.638999999999
why king did didn't you just mean doctor

5479.28 --> 5484.5599999999995
or something

5480.639 --> 5484.56
that would make slightly more sense

5485.6 --> 5491.84
right and you're welcome for translating

5489.28 --> 5491.84
it's easy

5510.8 --> 5519.84
right i'm gonna round out the show soon

5524.719 --> 5530.56
oh god stupid double dutch

5531.36 --> 5535.839999999999
double dutch is just like wooden shoes

5534.239 --> 5538.718999999999
you know it's like

5535.84 --> 5539.28
everybody talks about it oh it's such

5538.719 --> 5542.4800000000005
it's so

5539.28 --> 5547.84
me me yet it's kind of like

5542.48 --> 5547.839999999999
completely pointless

5550.8 --> 5556.159000000001
what double dutch in the uk means

5553.04 --> 5559.28
someone who's hard to understand

5556.159 --> 5562.4
what what's that supposed to mean

5559.28 --> 5565.36
is that an insult

5562.4 --> 5567.599999999999
is that still some crank for that time

5565.36 --> 5571.12
where the dutch fleet actually

5567.6 --> 5573.120000000001
beat the outnumbering british fleet

5571.12 --> 5588.63
a few hundred years ago i bet it's

5573.12 --> 5592.09
because of that isn't it

5588.63 --> 5592.09
[Music]

5599.44 --> 5603.04
all right would mind warped yeah that's

5600.88 --> 5606.4800000000005
funny dude can you also

5603.04 --> 5610.239
speak it or is it just writing because

5606.48 --> 5612.638999999999
hey if you want to train dutch

5610.239 --> 5617.839999999999
i'm up for that and there's some other

5612.639 --> 5617.84
dutch guys too

5619.52 --> 5624.400000000001
like uh roger is dutch

5622.719 --> 5625.84
well you could definitely hear it from

5624.4 --> 5629.5199999999995
his accent

5625.84 --> 5632.32
but yeah it's interesting you know

5629.52 --> 5635.6
dutch is a highly under over or

5632.32 --> 5635.599999999999
underestimated language

5636.0 --> 5639.92
told that she's skipping a rope what

5641.44 --> 5645.839999999999
what the

5646.88 --> 5651.84
i know tiny wombo i know it isn't meant

5649.28 --> 5652.159
as an insult it's just that the origins

5651.84 --> 5655.6
are

5652.159 --> 5658.719
probably based on

5655.6 --> 5663.52
a period like uh stupid dutch are like

5658.719 --> 5666.639
insane stupid fanatical

5663.52 --> 5670.2390000000005
it's like word sal exactly

5666.639 --> 5671.1990000000005
well look it the funny thing is too you

5670.239 --> 5674.718999999999
know that on

5671.199 --> 5677.839999999999
average this is provable on average

5674.719 --> 5678.88
when you have brits or americans or any

5677.84 --> 5682.08
english speaking

5678.88 --> 5683.04
and you have dutch it's very likely that

5682.08 --> 5686.0
all the dutch

5683.04 --> 5687.76
eventually will do a decent job

5686.0 --> 5690.56
communicating in english

5687.76 --> 5692.0
but as soon as they switch to dutch like

5690.56 --> 5695.1990000000005
the english are all going to be

5692.0 --> 5695.199
what the hell

5696.0 --> 5703.679
because dutch is pretty weird and rapid

5700.719 --> 5704.32
so yeah i totally get it but it happens

5703.679 --> 5708.32
a lot

5704.32 --> 5711.199
a lot of dutch people are just better

5708.32 --> 5712.32
at english than other than english

5711.199 --> 5715.839999999999
people are dutch

5712.32 --> 5715.84
it's just universal

5734.96 --> 5746.2390000000005
right that's fine tiny wombo okay

5742.32 --> 5750.799999999999
is it like george orwell's double speak

5746.239 --> 5753.5199999999995
oh i hope not bobby signs that

5750.8 --> 5754.96
i i don't see how that relates to the

5753.52 --> 5756.56
netherlands

5754.96 --> 5758.159
but anyway i'm rounding out the show

5756.56 --> 5760.4800000000005
it's already three o'clock

5758.159 --> 5761.599999999999
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

5760.48 --> 5764.08
liked this show

5761.6 --> 5766.08
i was a little bit angry at the start at

5764.08 --> 5769.6
youtube mostly

5766.08 --> 5772.48
got a lot of trolling but that's fine

5769.6 --> 5774.639
i think that despite my angry moment the

5772.48 --> 5776.799999999999
show has been very good and fluid

5774.639 --> 5778.719
just goes to show i guess sometimes i
