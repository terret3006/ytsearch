98.84 --> 105.84
huh

101.84 --> 108.88000000000001
so as you can already see it's pretty

105.84 --> 113.119
sunny again and it's even more

108.88 --> 113.119
clear skies now than was yesterday

113.36 --> 118.479
bright bright sun over there really

116.24 --> 121.439
beautiful

118.479 --> 121.439
and yeah

122.079 --> 126.88
not a lot of wind so it is still cold

126.159 --> 130.0
outside

126.88 --> 134.07999999999998
i cold enough for the snow to

130.0 --> 134.08
stay exactly as it was yesterday

135.84 --> 143.52
and yeah inside it the warmth is

139.28 --> 145.76
retained pretty well with all that sun

143.52 --> 146.56
so it's just a really nice winter day

145.76 --> 149.35999999999999
over here

146.56 --> 149.36
in the netherlands

149.92 --> 157.11999999999998
this 11th of february

154.84 --> 159.68
2021

157.12 --> 159.68
friday

161.28 --> 163.519
so

167.28 --> 175.44
let's see who's in chat zach was first

171.76 --> 176.48
here we go again yeah good to see you so

175.44 --> 181.12
far

176.48 --> 181.11999999999998
hope to see more people come and chat

182.84 --> 187.96
soon

184.8 --> 191.05
all right got green tea with me of

187.96 --> 191.05
[Music]

196.84 --> 199.84
course

201.84 --> 212.72
so yeah i got up even before 12 o'clock

208.0 --> 217.84
i had a very good night rest

212.72 --> 217.84
just still kind of enjoying the sun

220.959 --> 224.64000000000001
like as soon as the sun settles by the

223.92 --> 227.28
way

224.64 --> 229.11999999999998
yesterday as well like it does get a lot

227.28 --> 231.28
colder

229.12 --> 233.36
pretty quick it even snowed a bit

231.28 --> 234.56
yesterday while i was doing my newspaper

233.36 --> 241.84
round but not

234.56 --> 241.84
very hard it didn't persist

243.28 --> 245.519
uh

248.0 --> 257.199
what the doctor gonzo hello

254.0 --> 259.04
the globe do i think erdogan is part of

257.199 --> 263.68
the globe conspiracy

259.04 --> 266.24
which you mean upholding the

263.68 --> 267.52
globe earth i don't know i don't know

266.24 --> 271.36
where he stands he

267.52 --> 271.35999999999996
i think he would probably have to be

273.759 --> 276.88
now whether he personally believes in it

276.0 --> 283.84
or not

276.88 --> 283.84
i don't know

288.88 --> 294.0
i don't think he would really care all

292.0 --> 297.84
that much

294.0 --> 297.84
i think

298.96 --> 303.44
his space presentation

308.84 --> 314.79999999999995
nope

310.8 --> 314.8
had a space presentation

319.52 --> 325.84
building to base on the moon really

323.039 --> 325.84
turkey

331.12 --> 339.84000000000003
okay well then i guess he is becoming a

334.24 --> 339.84000000000003
part of it

350.4 --> 353.84
hello then keeper

358.0 --> 367.84
okay that's fine yeah i get it dr gonzo

376.16 --> 379.28000000000003
i thought she made

379.52 --> 381.84
the it

390.639 --> 399.12
yeah i don't think aids really exists

395.28 --> 399.11999999999995
i think it's just a condition

399.919 --> 402.15999999999997
all right

406.479 --> 413.28
i was watching some flat water

409.919 --> 413.28
before the show started

414.56 --> 421.12
but the ottawa tribe and lots of music

418.08 --> 423.84
and a bit of background history it was

421.12 --> 423.84000000000003
fascinating

438.319 --> 441.52000000000004
as for yesterday

444.56 --> 447.68
yeah the flat earth early bird was good

446.4 --> 450.08
it was fluid

447.68 --> 450.96
uh didn't watch it back but it remember

450.08 --> 453.919
it was good

450.96 --> 455.68
uh yeah the flat earth debate i was very

453.919 --> 459.52
active

455.68 --> 459.52
this time again as balwin

459.919 --> 467.039
also i devised a new machination

463.28 --> 470.4
that i predict like uh

467.039 --> 473.52
trenchers might utilize at some point it

470.4 --> 477.039
would be kind of wise of them

473.52 --> 479.44
from their perspective celestia over

477.039 --> 482.71999999999997
refraction

479.44 --> 485.96
to yeah to explain

482.72 --> 489.44000000000005
the uh the apparent

485.96 --> 492.15999999999997
divergence of the sun's rays

489.44 --> 493.599
on the earth it's it's an elaborate

492.16 --> 497.84000000000003
trick

493.599 --> 501.44
but i yeah i devised it in my mind

497.84 --> 505.039
and yeah i basically

501.44 --> 506.319
tried it out as ballwin on the flat

505.039 --> 508.31899999999996
earth debate

506.319 --> 509.759
it was funny to do and then eventually

508.319 --> 512.5600000000001
rumpus came in

509.759 --> 513.6800000000001
and kind of took over for me doing his

512.56 --> 516.7189999999999
own thing

513.68 --> 518.8
not really including uh celestial

516.719 --> 521.0390000000001
refraction by the way but

518.8 --> 522.4789999999999
he just tried to cognitive dissonance

521.039 --> 525.279
his way through it by

522.479 --> 527.9200000000001
upholding two positions at the same time

525.279 --> 530.959
something that nathan was attempting

527.92 --> 532.7199999999999
to accuse me as baldwin of as well with

530.959 --> 534.3199999999999
my celestial refraction but he just

532.72 --> 537.279
didn't understand

534.32 --> 538.32
right he didn't understand what i what

537.279 --> 540.16
it actually meant

538.32 --> 542.1600000000001
even though i did give elaborate

540.16 --> 544.8
explanations for it

542.16 --> 546.56
so we'll see where that goes i might

544.8 --> 548.4799999999999
poke around with the celestial

546.56 --> 550.3199999999999
refraction some more

548.48 --> 552.64
right and celestial refraction by the

550.32 --> 555.12
way is not the celestial refraction that

552.64 --> 556.8
is currently being used to explain why

555.12 --> 560.32
stars

556.8 --> 563.1999999999999
kind of yeah why there is some slight

560.32 --> 566.1600000000001
celestial deviation

563.2 --> 568.24
some actual apparent deviation of

566.16 --> 569.8389999999999
celestial bodies near the horizon

568.24 --> 572.16
right that's originally celestial

569.839 --> 573.9200000000001
refraction but i'm kind of like

572.16 --> 576.64
well doing what the ballers did with

573.92 --> 578.64
actual refraction changing it to

576.64 --> 582.0
terrestrial refraction and i've

578.64 --> 584.72
done a similar machination with the

582.0 --> 586.8
celestial bodies calling that celestial

584.72 --> 589.44
refraction

586.8 --> 590.8
very curious is how to how that will

589.44 --> 597.12
seep into the

590.8 --> 597.12
trench level ball versus flatter scene

597.279 --> 606.48
if it will maybe they just don't care

604.64 --> 607.92
uh but that was yeah that was very

606.48 --> 610.24
interesting to do

607.92 --> 612.0
after that been watching mostly just

610.24 --> 614.88
some alex jones and

612.0 --> 617.519
watching south park afterward did not

614.88 --> 621.519
catch lift the veil live

617.519 --> 623.2
went to bed pretty early for my uh now i

621.519 --> 627.279
can't even call that early

623.2 --> 627.279
still around three but

629.68 --> 633.8389999999999
that was my day yesterday was pretty

631.2 --> 633.839
good day

636.32 --> 643.9200000000001
and yeah the newspapers did not have a

639.44 --> 647.7600000000001
pro typical pro coronu type of title

643.92 --> 651.12
so i had no objection

647.76 --> 651.12
spreading that newspaper

658.839 --> 661.839
right

673.04 --> 681.04
okay george sanford low

676.16 --> 681.04
pcr test what is a pcr test

686.64 --> 691.36
is that like one of the corona tests i

688.72 --> 692.24
don't i'm sorry i i don't know exactly

691.36 --> 696.0
what you're

692.24 --> 696.0
referring to george sanford

696.48 --> 703.839
i could google it

704.01 --> 707.529
[Music]

711.12 --> 714.88
all right it is a corona test

742.079 --> 747.68
okay here we go again you know two

744.32 --> 747.6800000000001
people with hiv

748.24 --> 759.839
if you say so

765.6 --> 771.36
look i've met i like i've met

768.8 --> 773.519
plenty of people that proclaim to have

771.36 --> 776.399
all kinds of diseases

773.519 --> 776.8
like when i was delivering my ex through

776.399 --> 779.519
some

776.8 --> 781.279
game in a chat at one point i bumped

779.519 --> 786.079
into somebody that

781.279 --> 787.92
said that they had again some kind of

786.079 --> 790.079
yeah this was a really weird story they

787.92 --> 793.68
said they have a had aids

790.079 --> 796.959
and that it specifically was like

793.68 --> 799.519
some kind of weird for ryan that was

796.959 --> 800.4799999999999
literally destroying all of his bones or

799.519 --> 804.24
something

800.48 --> 805.6800000000001
so it wasn't cancer apparently

804.24 --> 807.839
it sounded like it was some kind of

805.68 --> 810.7199999999999
extremely aggressive leukemia or

807.839 --> 813.7600000000001
something but it was supposedly aids

810.72 --> 816.72
and he literally had like

813.76 --> 819.76
throughout his life like was it like 80

816.72 --> 821.6
percent of his bones were all replaced

819.76 --> 823.519
because it was like the most bizarre

821.6 --> 824.8000000000001
story i don't even know if it's real

823.519 --> 827.36
though

824.8 --> 828.0
i did feel a lot of grief coming from

827.36 --> 831.36
the person

828.0 --> 834.16
in the chat so i was assuming

831.36 --> 834.16
it was real

834.639 --> 838.88
but yeah that was pretty bizarre back

836.639 --> 838.88
then

839.199 --> 843.3599999999999
and i was like wow this guy is just

841.44 --> 846.639
absolutely surrendered to

843.36 --> 847.6800000000001
the medical system and he's just in this

846.639 --> 850.32
process

847.68 --> 851.519
he has very extreme symptoms but yeah if

850.32 --> 855.44
you're gonna

851.519 --> 857.519
go like almost bionic like that

855.44 --> 858.48
how well is that gonna go it's probably

857.519 --> 861.36
gonna get worse

858.48 --> 861.36
because there's more

861.76 --> 866.639
basically more surgery throughout the

863.839 --> 870.5600000000001
body replacing parts your body is going

866.639 --> 873.519
to have a response to that

870.56 --> 875.4399999999999
so yeah and i also didn't really

873.519 --> 878.399
understand like how that even related to

875.44 --> 878.399
aids or anything

880.0 --> 885.839
it was really weird

891.36 --> 898.0
you know like is it a virus or is aids

894.88 --> 900.399
just a state of your body

898.0 --> 902.0
where your immune system is basically so

900.399 --> 905.44
compromised

902.0 --> 908.16
that it can't fulfill its tasks anymore

905.44 --> 908.8800000000001
and you just get diseases that grow out

908.16 --> 911.279
of control

908.88 --> 912.88
but is that due to a virus or is it just

911.279 --> 917.36
due to

912.88 --> 917.36
systematic metabolic collapse

918.8 --> 921.3599999999999
i don't know

922.16 --> 929.199
i haven't exactly done personal

925.36 --> 929.1990000000001
medical research into this

932.079 --> 937.8389999999999
like i didn't know the guys vaccine

934.48 --> 937.839
history for example

938.839 --> 945.839
but he probably would have been

942.48 --> 947.44
before he had gotten that condition

945.839 --> 955.839
already pretty surrendered to the

947.44 --> 955.839
medical system to arrive to that point

966.839 --> 969.839
what

976.079 --> 982.959
okay you saw how ill he was when he was

979.04 --> 986.3199999999999
living with me

982.959 --> 990.8
he got the flu and it lasted three weeks

986.32 --> 994.24
okay so he got really really sick

990.8 --> 994.88
how does that make it hiv i i don't see

994.24 --> 999.04
it

994.88 --> 999.04
just means they're getting more sick

1001.44 --> 1004.48
like in the past i've had times where i

1003.92 --> 1006.88
got

1004.48 --> 1012.48
well the flu and it would last pretty

1006.88 --> 1014.56
damn long and other times

1012.48 --> 1016.5600000000001
like i barely get a cold and then get

1014.56 --> 1019.279
over it

1016.56 --> 1022.7199999999999
and right now it seems like i'm in a

1019.279 --> 1022.72
phase where i'm having this

1023.199 --> 1030.0
prolonged slight cold or at least

1026.64 --> 1034.0
symptoms of that but there's been no

1030.0 --> 1036.839
uh like sinus sinus pressure

1034.0 --> 1038.079
or anything it's just really basic

1036.839 --> 1041.76
sniffleness

1038.079 --> 1045.839
but it has been lasting quite long

1041.76 --> 1045.839
it's not constant though because it like

1046.0 --> 1053.84
it's like almost a cold but that's why i

1047.919 --> 1056.7990000000002
said earlier like is this some kind of a

1053.84 --> 1059.36
what do you call that some kind of a hay

1056.799 --> 1062.72
fever type allergy that's just

1059.36 --> 1066.6399999999999
very light and in combination with the

1062.72 --> 1069.28
i don't know pressure

1066.64 --> 1070.96
like suppressed anxiety this the stress

1069.28 --> 1072.799
of being our wind because it yeah

1070.96 --> 1076.559
there's

1072.799 --> 1079.52
isolation stress and media all that

1076.559 --> 1080.3999999999999
then maybe it's just these symptoms i

1079.52 --> 1082.8799999999999
don't even know

1080.4 --> 1084.48
whether i can consider it actually being

1082.88 --> 1087.3600000000001
a cold

1084.48 --> 1087.3600000000001
or an allergy

1088.0 --> 1095.84
so it's just super minor symptoms

1099.039 --> 1104.08
what's really ill got tests a month or

1100.88 --> 1104.0800000000002
so later and it was

1106.84 --> 1109.84
diagnosed

1115.2 --> 1119.039
couldn't eat i was wasting

1120.84 --> 1125.9189999999999
okay

1122.4 --> 1125.919
well remember last year

1126.4 --> 1130.3200000000002
i got really sick and i couldn't eat for

1128.48 --> 1137.84
a week

1130.32 --> 1137.84
fine now

1140.799 --> 1144.48
all right then again i didn't go to a

1143.76 --> 1151.84
hospital

1144.48 --> 1151.84
or something to get tested

1155.12 --> 1165.84
but i don't know i yeah i don't know

1158.88 --> 1165.8400000000001
here we go again

1172.72 --> 1179.84
oh tiny wumbo and mellow fellow by the

1176.84 --> 1179.84
way

1183.66 --> 1186.789
[Music]

1204.84 --> 1207.84
hmm

1221.44 --> 1228.0800000000002
right but in ways you know

1224.88 --> 1228.64
i'd be interested to even look a little

1228.08 --> 1232.84
deeper

1228.64 --> 1235.3600000000001
into medical research concerning hiv

1232.84 --> 1237.6789999999999
like

1235.36 --> 1240.559
what really determines whether you got

1237.679 --> 1242.799
it or not is it some kind of a

1240.559 --> 1244.0
some kind of a cell count like a t cell

1242.799 --> 1246.72
count i don't think it's t

1244.0 --> 1248.72
cells or maybe it is i don't know it's

1246.72 --> 1252.24
just a term i heard

1248.72 --> 1252.24
that typically involves in

1252.4 --> 1257.1200000000001
like viral detections i guess so i'd be

1255.6 --> 1259.6
interested to hear like

1257.12 --> 1261.28
how do they even get to the conclusion

1259.6 --> 1264.3999999999999
you have that and that it is

1261.28 --> 1266.24
infectious i know how it's supposed to

1264.4 --> 1269.52
be infectious

1266.24 --> 1270.559
right so with all these type type of

1269.52 --> 1272.6399999999999
diseases

1270.559 --> 1274.559
as i grew up i kind of just learned the

1272.64 --> 1278.48
practical side like okay how is

1274.559 --> 1278.48
how are things supposed to be infectious

1280.08 --> 1286.32
but then looking into well

1283.2 --> 1287.6000000000001
the issues with virus as with viruses as

1286.32 --> 1291.6789999999999
a theory

1287.6 --> 1294.08
just like a germ theory

1291.679 --> 1296.0800000000002
then i'd like to see just how do they

1294.08 --> 1296.3999999999999
actually come to the conclusion that you

1296.08 --> 1299.12
are

1296.4 --> 1299.8400000000001
infected with a virus like that with a

1299.12 --> 1304.32
specific

1299.84 --> 1306.32
virus it is t cells right

1304.32 --> 1309.12
so then it would just be interesting to

1306.32 --> 1312.6399999999999
see like how

1309.12 --> 1315.28
does that work just

1312.64 --> 1316.4
do you never have any moments where t

1315.28 --> 1318.72
cell count is

1316.4 --> 1320.64
high or low which is it is it like a low

1318.72 --> 1321.6000000000001
count and you have the viruses or high

1320.64 --> 1324.24
count you have to fight

1321.6 --> 1324.24
probably high

1325.36 --> 1328.4799999999998
and then i just wonder isn't it just

1327.6 --> 1332.32
arbitrary

1328.48 --> 1336.24
basically when you are in a peak

1332.32 --> 1339.6789999999999
moment you with those t cells

1336.24 --> 1342.24
and you get diagnosed

1339.679 --> 1344.4
or you you get it analyzed a sample

1342.24 --> 1346.88
blood sample or whatever by a doctor

1344.4 --> 1348.48
that they could just say oh you got this

1346.88 --> 1352.159
because of the high

1348.48 --> 1353.679
t cell count and then it would just go

1352.159 --> 1357.3600000000001
away because then

1353.679 --> 1358.799
it would just be a well more like a

1357.36 --> 1362.4799999999998
fictional disease

1358.799 --> 1365.28
associated with i don't know moments of

1362.48 --> 1365.28
high immune

1372.84 --> 1375.84
response

1376.4 --> 1380.24
yeah the mets bring on the aids

1381.52 --> 1389.84
yeah i've heard that too

1403.12 --> 1406.32
but it you know

1406.4 --> 1410.72
i don't i don't have i'm not a medical

1409.36 --> 1413.6
doctor i haven't done

1410.72 --> 1415.6000000000001
like the well the homework a doctor does

1413.6 --> 1418.3999999999999
to become a doctor right

1415.6 --> 1419.12
just via other people paid a lot of

1418.4 --> 1424.0
attention

1419.12 --> 1427.36
because i do value well medical research

1424.0 --> 1430.24
for the knowledge of it but yeah if

1427.36 --> 1432.799
there were some meds

1430.24 --> 1433.36
supposedly involved with it and they

1432.799 --> 1436.96
would

1433.36 --> 1438.9599999999998
well suppress t cells or something

1436.96 --> 1441.039
right because that is considered

1438.96 --> 1444.159
dangerous

1441.039 --> 1445.919
then well

1444.159 --> 1448.7990000000002
wouldn't it basically just be that

1445.919 --> 1452.0
suppressing the t cells actually causes

1448.799 --> 1453.679
extreme weakness to disease and thus the

1452.0 --> 1456.48
aids condition

1453.679 --> 1458.0
i don't know it's very basic putting

1456.48 --> 1460.799
things together i might be

1458.0 --> 1462.559
wrong i might be getting things 180

1460.799 --> 1465.36
degrees flipped around and how it

1462.559 --> 1465.36
actually works

1466.88 --> 1472.5590000000002
but yeah i've heard before that the

1470.08 --> 1474.24
supposed medication actually caused the

1472.559 --> 1476.24
aids condition and i wouldn't be

1474.24 --> 1478.32
surprised if it was because of something

1476.24 --> 1480.96
like that

1478.32 --> 1482.799
if the supposed problem is compromised

1480.96 --> 1484.88
immune system and then they're going to

1482.799 --> 1487.279
suppress the effective reaction

1484.88 --> 1491.2
associated with that

1487.279 --> 1493.12
then well if that reaction simply was a

1491.2 --> 1494.4
immune reaction then they are

1493.12 --> 1497.6789999999999
potentially

1494.4 --> 1500.799
tempering with the natural immune system

1497.679 --> 1503.6000000000001
with those medications right doesn't

1500.799 --> 1505.52
that make sense

1503.6 --> 1508.48
now you tamper with the immune system

1505.52 --> 1510.48
yeah aids

1508.48 --> 1512.84
the condition where your immune system

1510.48 --> 1517.279
is ineffective supposedly

1512.84 --> 1517.279
infected by the virus

1517.919 --> 1522.88
which would cause you to become

1519.6 --> 1524.8799999999999
vulnerable to any disease right

1522.88 --> 1529.8400000000001
just putting a couple of elements

1524.88 --> 1529.8400000000001
together that's it

1540.84 --> 1543.84
right

1544.159 --> 1548.72
so i do wonder you know if it is all

1546.24 --> 1552.32
about t cells to supposedly detect

1548.72 --> 1552.32
hiv do they actually

1553.84 --> 1560.72
like take those t-cell samples

1557.44 --> 1561.2
and then try to isolate a specific type

1560.72 --> 1565.039
of

1561.2 --> 1570.4
viral rna on them

1565.039 --> 1574.24
to figure out whether there is this hiv

1570.4 --> 1576.5590000000002
virus infection on the immune cells

1574.24 --> 1577.44
do they even do that or do they just go

1576.559 --> 1580.48
with the

1577.44 --> 1584.0800000000002
number of uh of t

1580.48 --> 1587.279
cells on them and i don't know like rd

1584.08 --> 1590.8799999999999
suppose it is the supposed hiv

1587.279 --> 1594.48
virus is it not just an inherent part

1590.88 --> 1595.44
of the body really just like most other

1594.48 --> 1599.84
viral

1595.44 --> 1602.96
agents cleanup crew

1599.84 --> 1605.039
i don't know i don't know i would love

1602.96 --> 1607.1200000000001
to talk with some doctors that are more

1605.039 --> 1609.039
studied into this sort of thing

1607.12 --> 1613.039
have a back and forth conversation to

1609.039 --> 1615.039
clear this up

1613.039 --> 1616.32
because i have heard other people talk

1615.039 --> 1619.52
about it

1616.32 --> 1622.48
but never like it yeah me engaging in

1619.52 --> 1624.84
interactive conversation

1622.48 --> 1627.84
and i would be open for that sort of

1624.84 --> 1627.84
information

1628.0 --> 1633.039
right oh yeah another detail i might

1631.36 --> 1635.84
because

1633.039 --> 1636.24
i might regret it but i've been pretty

1635.84 --> 1638.8799999999999
much

1636.24 --> 1640.32
invited by mr sensible to come on this

1638.88 --> 1643.279
show

1640.32 --> 1645.36
this evening so i might appear on him i

1643.279 --> 1647.039
don't know

1645.36 --> 1649.4399999999998
what's it going to be like if i'm going

1647.039 --> 1652.0
to be just feeling kind of stupid

1649.44 --> 1652.0
afterward

1652.559 --> 1658.559
but we'll see he he promised it was

1655.76 --> 1660.799
gonna be civil

1658.559 --> 1662.399
and yeah if he's just gonna entrap me

1660.799 --> 1663.52
i'm just going to unravel those

1662.399 --> 1666.1589999999999
entrapments and

1663.52 --> 1669.12
if he's gonna keep on doing it i'll

1666.159 --> 1670.88
eventually tell him that i'm getting

1669.12 --> 1672.399
kind of bored with it and all that but

1670.88 --> 1674.88
we'll see i might try it

1672.399 --> 1675.6
it's a little late for my doing usually

1674.88 --> 1678.72
in a time where

1675.6 --> 1681.6789999999999
not really high energy anymore but

1678.72 --> 1682.0
if it's just gonna be civil and not too

1681.679 --> 1683.6000000000001
much

1682.0 --> 1686.48
under pressure that they're not going to

1683.6 --> 1689.6
scatter gun me or something

1686.48 --> 1689.6
then it should be fine

1692.72 --> 1697.84
what the hell dr gonzo

1701.52 --> 1705.52
i'm gonna start my hiv journey that's

1704.559 --> 1710.0
disgusting

1705.52 --> 1712.399
dr gonzo

1710.0 --> 1713.76
i would just like to talk with people

1712.399 --> 1717.4399999999998
that have actually

1713.76 --> 1719.44
done like the laboratory study work

1717.44 --> 1722.96
that actually look at the blood samples

1719.44 --> 1726.3990000000001
that actually look for the viral

1722.96 --> 1728.32
agents to identify it that's the type of

1726.399 --> 1730.559
people i want to talk about

1728.32 --> 1732.72
i don't want to talk with about this

1730.559 --> 1735.2
subject to figure it out

1732.72 --> 1738.32
i'm going to go in age journey thank you

1735.2 --> 1739.97
very much

1738.32 --> 1743.1599999999999
yuck

1739.97 --> 1743.16
[Music]

1750.159 --> 1756.3990000000001
hmm hey well

1753.84 --> 1759.4399999999998
malnutrition yeah if it anything that

1756.399 --> 1761.84
has to do with the immune system

1759.44 --> 1764.799
there's just malnutrition for example

1761.84 --> 1768.32
and there is plenty of stress

1764.799 --> 1771.6
or like uh burdening

1768.32 --> 1773.6789999999999
ecological issues like

1771.6 --> 1774.799
living in a jungle is pretty burdensome

1773.679 --> 1776.64
in general

1774.799 --> 1778.559
for example not saying that they'll live

1776.64 --> 1780.3200000000002
in the jungle

1778.559 --> 1781.9189999999999
like not all of africa's jungle of

1780.32 --> 1784.799
course but that would be

1781.919 --> 1786.3990000000001
an influence so yeah i'm always going to

1784.799 --> 1790.08
approach it with the terrain theory

1786.399 --> 1790.08
which is very relevant always

1790.32 --> 1795.12
and then yeah if somebody say oh it's

1793.12 --> 1798.6399999999999
bigger problem in africa yeah i

1795.12 --> 1798.6399999999999
wouldn't be surprised

1802.64 --> 1808.64
that malnutrition has something to do

1804.399 --> 1811.279
with it sure

1808.64 --> 1811.8400000000001
but that doesn't mean that it is a virus

1811.279 --> 1815.6
just

1811.84 --> 1817.6
to me it's more like a condition

1815.6 --> 1818.799
that can arrive and that is being

1817.6 --> 1822.0
interpreted as an

1818.799 --> 1824.1589999999999
infectious agent like that although

1822.0 --> 1825.44
yeah even if you have are in that

1824.159 --> 1828.3200000000002
condition that condition

1825.44 --> 1830.64
might like cascade on to others so in

1828.32 --> 1832.72
that sense it might be infectious

1830.64 --> 1834.72
but not because of a viral agent but

1832.72 --> 1836.159
just because of the state of being in

1834.72 --> 1839.679
that condition

1836.159 --> 1842.3200000000002
i don't know my might rub off

1839.679 --> 1842.3200000000002
on others

1842.96 --> 1847.52
see things are a little complicated that

1848.84 --> 1851.84
way

1861.36 --> 1865.1999999999998
the fish island supports that we have

1863.2 --> 1867.76
earth curve yeah i heard it and i know

1865.2 --> 1867.76
he's a tool

1871.12 --> 1875.6789999999999
but he says very amusing thing sometimes

1876.84 --> 1879.84
though

1886.64 --> 1891.6000000000001
okay dr gonzo that's cute

1889.919 --> 1896.48
but what do you mean exactly with

1891.6 --> 1899.039
fabricated is it a fabricated concept

1896.48 --> 1900.72
or was it supposedly fabricated in the

1899.039 --> 1907.84
laboratory

1900.72 --> 1907.84
what exactly do you mean dr gonzalo

1926.27 --> 1929.41
[Music]

1946.88 --> 1951.8400000000001
or don't answer just leave it like that

1949.44 --> 1951.8400000000001
fine

1953.2 --> 1963.8400000000001
ah there you go yeah that's a

1956.88 --> 1963.8400000000001
really nice story

1996.799 --> 2002.0
it's a legit story oh really how do you

2002.84 --> 2005.84
know

2010.399 --> 2014.2399999999998
you're talking about virus strains but

2012.399 --> 2017.4399999999998
you're overlooking that virus

2014.24 --> 2020.48
are not living entities

2017.44 --> 2023.519
they're systems

2020.48 --> 2027.84
inherent to physical body viruses don't

2023.519 --> 2029.919
exist really without the body

2027.84 --> 2032.559
outside of the body they're just

2029.919 --> 2035.76
discarded junk they're basically

2032.559 --> 2039.76
inanimate material

2035.76 --> 2043.2
they're not er yeah an entity

2039.76 --> 2044.48
that is invading other species no it's

2043.2 --> 2048.32
body inherent

2044.48 --> 2048.32
all viruses are body inherent

2055.599 --> 2062.32
like viruses don't form and

2059.04 --> 2067.839
mutate ultra in nature

2062.32 --> 2067.839
right bacteria mutate in nature

2073.04 --> 2079.359
now they say that viruses

2076.24 --> 2079.919
rapidly change right that's supposed to

2079.359 --> 2082.96
be

2079.919 --> 2082.96
the story about it

2083.599 --> 2092.56
well how does that work

2089.52 --> 2096.159
like does it or do

2092.56 --> 2098.24
bodies like living bodies that actually

2096.159 --> 2102.32
produce these viruses

2098.24 --> 2105.5989999999997
actually just change their specific

2102.32 --> 2107.52
type of virus cleanup response

2105.599 --> 2108.8
and that is actually the thing that's

2107.52 --> 2116.0
mutating it's like

2108.8 --> 2118.96
the response is mutating

2116.0 --> 2121.28
so yeah i know it's it's a little bit

2118.96 --> 2123.44
complicated

2121.28 --> 2125.2000000000003
every time i hear these stories i just

2123.44 --> 2127.28
see that they're just constructed

2125.2 --> 2127.5989999999997
narrative based on presuppositions that

2127.28 --> 2131.8390000000004
are

2127.599 --> 2131.839
not confirmed in the slightest

2132.079 --> 2145.8390000000004
so they're all very presuppositional

2134.32 --> 2145.839
like that

2177.52 --> 2181.359
i'm just wondering if it can even be

2179.599 --> 2185.2000000000003
proven that

2181.359 --> 2187.52
the exact like could the exact viral

2185.2 --> 2190.0789999999997
agents of something even be properly

2187.52 --> 2192.0
isolated and then

2190.079 --> 2194.96
let's just say in a controlled

2192.0 --> 2198.16
experiment you take the very specific

2194.96 --> 2201.44
isolated particles not enhanced or

2198.16 --> 2204.0
suppressed by anything just

2201.44 --> 2205.119
the viral part only the viral particles

2204.0 --> 2208.56
absolutely pure

2205.119 --> 2212.0
uncontaminated in any way right

2208.56 --> 2212.64
if you would just let that rub off on a

2212.0 --> 2215.839
person

2212.64 --> 2217.2799999999997
are they going to be infected because i

2215.839 --> 2220.72
thought

2217.28 --> 2222.4
i remember from dr hammer or people

2220.72 --> 2225.1189999999997
referring to him

2222.4 --> 2227.28
talking about it that this was actually

2225.119 --> 2231.76
sort of tested

2227.28 --> 2235.52
even with animals up to a point where

2231.76 --> 2238.88
like with some kind of a horse virus

2235.52 --> 2242.32
supposed thing they would just

2238.88 --> 2245.52
put that into a feeding bag

2242.32 --> 2249.28
and just put it on a horse's mouth

2245.52 --> 2254.64
for like hours and they would not

2249.28 --> 2254.6400000000003
get a single infection from that

2255.04 --> 2262.0
because yeah the specific viral agents

2258.64 --> 2266.24
are not really the infective thing it's

2262.0 --> 2268.88
more like it's tools laying around

2266.24 --> 2269.5989999999997
and once your subconscious or your body

2268.88 --> 2272.1600000000003
chemistry

2269.599 --> 2274.4
picks up on those tools being around it

2272.16 --> 2278.3199999999997
starts to consider

2274.4 --> 2281.119
should we do that too but it's like not

2278.32 --> 2281.599
it's not being forced to do it it's just

2281.119 --> 2284.7200000000003
like

2281.599 --> 2286.88
should we do that that's how i try to

2284.72 --> 2290.3999999999996
see it

2286.88 --> 2294.0
so the condition can rub off

2290.4 --> 2296.48
the immune condition it's like hey

2294.0 --> 2298.8
that person's cleaning up now i'm in the

2296.48 --> 2313.839
mood to clean up as well

2298.8 --> 2313.8390000000004
it's more in that line of effect

2322.4 --> 2327.839
all right

2331.52 --> 2337.48
[Music]

2338.839 --> 2341.839
so

2347.04 --> 2352.48
yeah that's right larry the march i do

2349.599 --> 2352.48
remember uh

2352.8 --> 2356.5600000000004
mr sensible saying that as well

2360.56 --> 2364.0789999999997
of course you can apologize for him and

2362.88 --> 2367.44
try to

2364.079 --> 2383.8390000000004
suggest he didn't mean that right

2367.44 --> 2383.839
but he did say it on camera

2401.359 --> 2404.96
right so but we'll see we'll see if i

2404.079 --> 2408.2400000000002
get on there

2404.96 --> 2408.2400000000002
if i feel like it or not

2409.52 --> 2411.839
oh

2422.839 --> 2425.839
man

2430.55 --> 2433.6090000000004
[Music]

2445.119 --> 2447.76
right so

2448.96 --> 2453.839
what's this

2457.2 --> 2462.16
oh he that's a very nice description of

2460.72 --> 2466.0789999999997
something he did

2462.16 --> 2471.04
larry demarsh that does not exclude him

2466.079 --> 2471.04
from having said however

2473.119 --> 2477.119
that indeed the fish island supports

2476.24 --> 2479.839
that we have a

2477.119 --> 2483.04
earth curve he did literally say that on

2479.839 --> 2483.04
one of his videos so

2488.079 --> 2493.04
will you let us know in skype if you go

2490.4 --> 2495.839
mr sensible yeah yeah sure

2493.04 --> 2495.839
sure i will

2523.119 --> 2528.0
he's smarter than that yeah i think you

2526.24 --> 2537.839
overestimate

2528.0 --> 2537.839
that little larry the march

2544.09 --> 2547.1490000000003
[Music]

2576.839 --> 2579.839
okay

2580.96 --> 2583.28
hmm

2587.119 --> 2592.319
that's weird i'm hearing a fly somewhere

2589.839 --> 2594.7999999999997
but i can't see it i see

2592.319 --> 2594.8
nothing

2596.16 --> 2609.979
so wherever it's at it's out of my view

2606.86 --> 2609.9790000000003
[Music]

2641.92 --> 2646.079
yeah we'll see what happens metal

2643.68 --> 2646.0789999999997
feather

2646.16 --> 2650.48
if he's gonna try to do some weird

2648.319 --> 2652.64
rhombus trickery and trapping of some

2650.48 --> 2654.2400000000002
kind i will figure it out and i will

2652.64 --> 2656.7999999999997
probably just start laughing really

2654.24 --> 2656.7999999999997
loudly

2657.04 --> 2661.2799999999997
where is it coming from

2661.44 --> 2666.319
oh there you are what are you doing here

2673.68 --> 2676.72
uh what channel would this be on well

2675.68 --> 2691.839
his channel

2676.72 --> 2691.839
i don't know i'm not subscribed to him

2700.24 --> 2704.0
right but look guys i don't think you

2703.76 --> 2708.3190000000004
should

2704.0 --> 2711.28
be expecting that i'm like going to be

2708.319 --> 2712.72
like super strict on it because it's

2711.28 --> 2716.0
just no use you know he

2712.72 --> 2717.1189999999997
is absolutely a zealot and if he's gonna

2716.0 --> 2719.44
push to that

2717.119 --> 2721.839
i'll just be laughing at him like i

2719.44 --> 2723.52
don't need to hand over the arguments

2721.839 --> 2726.24
really anymore

2723.52 --> 2728.0
i don't need to do that because

2726.24 --> 2731.2799999999997
everything's been repeated to

2728.0 --> 2733.68
no end just so

2731.28 --> 2736.3190000000004
yeah i don't have to do it for the sound

2733.68 --> 2739.839
bite i'll just be laughing

2736.319 --> 2747.839
when when he says something really funny

2739.839 --> 2747.839
just keep it very short

2752.56 --> 2756.72
all right because i'm i'm not expecting

2754.4 --> 2758.7200000000003
to have like this masterpiece

2756.72 --> 2760.0789999999997
unrolling on this show that all

2758.72 --> 2761.7599999999998
completely undoes

2760.079 --> 2763.44
what he's always been trying to uphold

2761.76 --> 2765.6800000000003
no no no

2763.44 --> 2765.68
no

2768.16 --> 2772.0789999999997
or maybe maybe if he's really gonna push

2770.56 --> 2775.92
it and he's really gonna at

2772.079 --> 2779.2400000000002
home secretly in some way try to

2775.92 --> 2781.2000000000003
approach me like i'm this soft or

2779.24 --> 2783.2799999999997
semi-retarded person

2781.2 --> 2785.52
is going to emphasize my lack of

2783.28 --> 2788.88
societal success or something

2785.52 --> 2792.16
well then i might absolutely condense

2788.88 --> 2794.1600000000003
a little and start to absolutely turn

2792.16 --> 2797.359
him inside out

2794.16 --> 2799.839
from a very similar soft position

2797.359 --> 2800.7999999999997
but i'm not expecting he'll do that i

2799.839 --> 2804.96
think he has

2800.8 --> 2804.96
enough sense left to not go there

2806.56 --> 2809.2
but we'll see

2809.24 --> 2812.4199999999996
[Music]

2814.319 --> 2820.079
that's right julio pebbin that's right i

2817.2 --> 2823.2
have full confidence in my knowledge

2820.079 --> 2824.8
and the funny thing is is that

2823.2 --> 2826.8799999999997
i have so much confidence in my

2824.8 --> 2828.319
knowledge that i know exactly how to

2826.88 --> 2831.2000000000003
deal with anything

2828.319 --> 2832.16
that which i know really well and that

2831.2 --> 2835.9199999999996
which i know

2832.16 --> 2839.04
not so well i still know how well i know

2835.92 --> 2842.079
that which i don't know and know how to

2839.04 --> 2842.079
deal with it and know

2842.24 --> 2847.5989999999997
what is it there i know what to trust

2845.119 --> 2852.079
about what i don't understand

2847.599 --> 2852.079
it sounds a little complicated what i do

2853.119 --> 2857.52
i know things this sounds really

2856.0 --> 2860.24
mystical but i know things

2857.52 --> 2861.359
without actually knowing them by just

2860.24 --> 2863.839
having

2861.359 --> 2865.2
a superficial sense of it and then

2863.839 --> 2868.319
cross-referencing it

2865.2 --> 2870.5589999999997
with everything else and that way

2868.319 --> 2872.88
at some point you don't even have to

2870.559 --> 2876.0
know all the details

2872.88 --> 2878.48
to know exactly what things are

2876.0 --> 2880.559
because of the patterns just recognize

2878.48 --> 2880.559
it

2880.96 --> 2884.48
so yeah you don't have to be

2884.64 --> 2892.319
some technical expert

2888.0 --> 2894.88
at something to undo technical expertise

2892.319 --> 2896.5589999999997
in that region

2894.88 --> 2898.559
when somebody's fooling around with it

2896.559 --> 2901.119
and trying to spin doctor kind of

2898.559 --> 2903.119
stories and [ __ ] you don't necessarily

2901.119 --> 2906.079
have to be a technical expert at

2903.119 --> 2909.6800000000003
in that field to counter it because just

2906.079 --> 2912.88
understanding the entire situation

2909.68 --> 2914.0
will well already it's very easy to

2912.88 --> 2917.2000000000003
build towards it

2914.0 --> 2919.2
and then show how whatever machination

2917.2 --> 2921.839
is being forwarded just doesn't fit in

2919.2 --> 2921.839
the whole picture

2926.839 --> 2929.839
see

2934.48 --> 2941.68
it's all about learning enough to know

2938.88 --> 2943.839
and understand that which you do not

2941.68 --> 2943.839
know

2956.62 --> 2959.77
[Music]

2968.839 --> 2971.839
hmm

2976.13 --> 2979.2490000000003
[Music]

2982.839 --> 2985.839
so

2996.16 --> 3013.839
distortion supports the curve

3019.359 --> 3023.04
right yeah maybe i'll give a mellow

3021.2 --> 3025.68
fellow a wrench he's been around for

3023.04 --> 3027.92
quite a while and had some good input

3025.68 --> 3030.96
good frequencies

3027.92 --> 3030.96
i think he deserves it

3034.079 --> 3041.8390000000004
follow the rules and you can keep it

3042.88 --> 3049.92
but yeah you should be able to post the

3045.92 --> 3049.92
links now mellow fellow

3051.92 --> 3055.359
man i'm always stretching a lot on my

3054.16 --> 3059.2
show

3055.359 --> 3061.5989999999997
as i really am but it's just so good to

3059.2 --> 3061.5989999999997
do that

3062.16 --> 3066.8799999999997
like stretching for me is like really

3064.8 --> 3069.3590000000004
enjoyable

3066.88 --> 3071.44
especially in the first half of the day

3069.359 --> 3072.5589999999997
and i always typically do it by the way

3071.44 --> 3074.079
it's like

3072.559 --> 3076.0
especially when i engage in

3074.079 --> 3079.6800000000003
communication

3076.0 --> 3082.72
so even before i did shows people that

3079.68 --> 3084.96
have known me like in face-to-face

3082.72 --> 3085.4399999999996
situation conversations know that if i'm

3084.96 --> 3088.16
going to

3085.44 --> 3089.28
like engage in some like high

3088.16 --> 3092.0
intellectual level

3089.28 --> 3092.96
thought or just condensed enough i do

3092.0 --> 3094.64
typically

3092.96 --> 3097.52
start to stretch it's like my mind

3094.64 --> 3101.04
condenses then my body needs to stretch

3097.52 --> 3101.04
needs to flex needs to

3101.76 --> 3105.8390000000004
to create like optimal blood flow or

3103.92 --> 3106.319
something because it does do that right

3105.839 --> 3109.52
you know

3106.319 --> 3112.319
you know that that stretching like

3109.52 --> 3114.4
like the morning yawn and stretching

3112.319 --> 3117.7599999999998
that it typically just

3114.4 --> 3119.599
it causes this extra pump

3117.76 --> 3122.079
you can feel that like if it's really

3119.599 --> 3126.0
heavy you can even feel the rush

3122.079 --> 3126.0
and even sometimes hear it in your ears

3127.04 --> 3130.5589999999997
so yeah stretching like that is actually

3128.96 --> 3132.4
healthy

3130.559 --> 3134.1600000000003
but if you're in a room with really

3132.4 --> 3137.359
tired people and you do that

3134.16 --> 3140.72
then a lot of people will start to get

3137.359 --> 3140.72
the same reflexes

3143.68 --> 3150.5589999999997
but yeah it's a morning show so

3146.72 --> 3153.359
it's good maybe even help people wake up

3150.559 --> 3154.6400000000003
when i do it it's funny i i thought

3153.359 --> 3157.92
about that i have been

3154.64 --> 3157.92
now i'm just addressing it

3159.839 --> 3167.839
i'm sure that's called yoga

3168.64 --> 3171.839
yeah dr gonzo but

3172.4 --> 3176.079
but you're also a bit of a zealot

3178.72 --> 3183.4399999999996
you know i'd give ballers wrenches but

3181.52 --> 3185.68
if they show

3183.44 --> 3187.599
valid behavior in any form then i

3185.68 --> 3189.5989999999997
usually end up taking them away because

3187.599 --> 3192.48
the zealotry just

3189.599 --> 3192.48
is too risky

3193.359 --> 3200.0789999999997
and it's not even that they would abuse

3197.599 --> 3201.28
literally the wrench function i've

3200.079 --> 3204.88
rarely seen that

3201.28 --> 3207.44
it's just that if somebody with a wrench

3204.88 --> 3208.96
starts to show zealotry it's kind of

3207.44 --> 3212.48
like they take cover a bit

3208.96 --> 3213.28
behind the wrench and they show more

3212.48 --> 3216.72
zealotry

3213.28 --> 3220.3190000000004
and that's something i don't want

3216.72 --> 3220.319
that's not what the wrench is for

3221.119 --> 3225.119
now if you can't suppress that sort of

3223.2 --> 3228.96
behavior

3225.119 --> 3232.7200000000003
then it's okay but i even look if

3228.96 --> 3235.04
flat earthers with wrenches

3232.72 --> 3236.3999999999996
start to behave that way from a flatter

3235.04 --> 3240.16
perspective

3236.4 --> 3242.559
i i do not like appreciate that

3240.16 --> 3244.16
it's like i do let it happen sometimes

3242.559 --> 3244.8
because we have remarks but if you're

3244.16 --> 3248.0789999999997
like gonna

3244.8 --> 3250.319
really aggressively hammer on something

3248.079 --> 3251.6800000000003
then i eventually will ask you to tone

3250.319 --> 3254.0
it down a little

3251.68 --> 3255.7599999999998
even though you might be right you know

3254.0 --> 3258.079
but that's not what really what it's

3255.76 --> 3260.1600000000003
really about

3258.079 --> 3261.8390000000004
it's just that people with wrenches are

3260.16 --> 3265.839
expected to behave

3261.839 --> 3265.839
at a better standard

3268.96 --> 3275.2
it doesn't mean that you can't express

3270.64 --> 3275.2
just natural opinions or feelings

3276.319 --> 3279.7599999999998
but you can't just let it go because you

3278.72 --> 3282.8799999999997
got a wrench

3279.76 --> 3293.28
and nobody can stop you right that's not

3282.88 --> 3296.4
what the wrench is for

3293.28 --> 3296.4
that's right tiny wumbo

3301.92 --> 3306.559
now you just follow probabilities of

3304.559 --> 3309.6800000000003
what makes sense

3306.559 --> 3312.2400000000002
yeah well your probability system is

3309.68 --> 3314.96
highly compromised and flawed because it

3312.24 --> 3318.0
has real eroded you

3314.96 --> 3320.079
in a very certain direction that is

3318.0 --> 3322.64
riddled with pitfalls and holes

3320.079 --> 3322.6400000000003
and so

3324.64 --> 3327.839
you have been misled

3328.799 --> 3332.24
you can say that was uh with a decent

3331.119 --> 3335.839
amount of certainty

3332.24 --> 3335.839
dr gonzo

3349.359 --> 3354.54
yeah random explorer but yeah you can

3353.2 --> 3358.3999999999996
post links

3354.54 --> 3358.4
[Music]

3359.2 --> 3364.24
don't forget about that part and in the

3362.4 --> 3368.48
sense you can post the link

3364.24 --> 3368.4799999999996
without necessarily having to ask me

3374.839 --> 3377.839
right

3379.64 --> 3383.44
probabilities is the only thing we got

3381.92 --> 3386.48
to clinch on

3383.44 --> 3389.119
no no no

3386.48 --> 3390.0
absolutely not no there's all kinds of

3389.119 --> 3393.119
certainty

3390.0 --> 3396.559
you should be clinging on to

3393.119 --> 3399.119
like things like natural law

3396.559 --> 3400.1600000000003
things we know about physics it's not

3399.119 --> 3403.04
probabilities

3400.16 --> 3404.16
this absolute certainty your

3403.04 --> 3406.319
probabilities

3404.16 --> 3407.5989999999997
have migrated into science fiction

3406.319 --> 3412.5589999999997
territory

3407.599 --> 3412.559
and you were okay with that yeah

3412.96 --> 3419.839
so you you as i said you got it all

3417.52 --> 3419.839
wrong

3425.359 --> 3431.839
you believe in things that you shouldn't

3429.52 --> 3433.2
and then you declare yourself being an

3431.839 --> 3435.359
agnostic

3433.2 --> 3437.2799999999997
and that you're following probabilities

3435.359 --> 3440.4
completely overlooking that yeah

3437.28 --> 3443.6800000000003
what you think as probabilities is

3440.4 --> 3445.76
not reasonable so your entire vantage

3443.68 --> 3448.24
point is completely compromised from the

3445.76 --> 3448.2400000000002
get-go

3449.2 --> 3452.64
because this is where you ended up

3459.2 --> 3465.4399999999996
ah okay here we go again

3462.4 --> 3465.44
thanks for popping by

3466.559 --> 3470.2400000000002
hmm yeah good luck with the with the job

3469.52 --> 3474.0
try out

3470.24 --> 3476.5589999999997
i hope that works out

3474.0 --> 3476.559
see you later

3477.11 --> 3480.3
[Music]

3482.63 --> 3486.13
[Music]

3487.44 --> 3493.2400000000002
right now but the thing is

3490.96 --> 3495.119
there are certainties and then there are

3493.24 --> 3497.04
uncertainties and when it comes to

3495.119 --> 3499.599
uncertainties

3497.04 --> 3501.2799999999997
yeah probabilities is a great way of

3499.599 --> 3503.28
dealing that with it

3501.28 --> 3506.4
it's basically probabilities is like

3503.28 --> 3510.96
predicting the path that is out of reach

3506.4 --> 3510.96
right but

3511.28 --> 3516.96
you should only apply that when you have

3514.48 --> 3518.2400000000002
absolute certainties of what is within

3516.96 --> 3521.28
reach because then

3518.24 --> 3522.5589999999997
you can properly start to predict what

3521.28 --> 3525.119
is out of reach

3522.559 --> 3526.48
based on what is confirmed to be within

3525.119 --> 3528.839
reach

3526.48 --> 3530.559
if you're going to misinterpret

3528.839 --> 3534.64
misassume

3530.559 --> 3536.88
and just embrace blatant falsehoods

3534.64 --> 3538.0789999999997
from within the spectrum of what is

3536.88 --> 3540.4
known

3538.079 --> 3542.1600000000003
yeah then any probabilities you're going

3540.4 --> 3544.7200000000003
to preoccupy yourself with

3542.16 --> 3547.04
with what is out of reach is going to be

3544.72 --> 3550.0789999999997
completely flawed because it's based on

3547.04 --> 3553.68
false pre-assumption of what is known

3550.079 --> 3553.6800000000003
entire vantage point is flawed

3554.24 --> 3562.919
dr gonzo

3559.78 --> 3562.9190000000003
[Music]

3592.64 --> 3599.04
a lot of uncertain viewpoints

3595.76 --> 3602.48
no no

3599.04 --> 3603.68
that's a total straw man what uncertain

3602.48 --> 3607.68
viewpoints about

3603.68 --> 3607.68
god in flat earth no

3607.839 --> 3611.68
no the the certainties are absolutely

3610.319 --> 3615.52
there

3611.68 --> 3619.2
there has to be a creator things

3615.52 --> 3622.64
as they are are per definition

3619.2 --> 3624.16
structurally designed on many many

3622.64 --> 3628.48
levels like even the way

3624.16 --> 3631.2799999999997
matter functions is designed

3628.48 --> 3632.0
it's all a giant framework of design all

3631.28 --> 3634.6400000000003
of it

3632.0 --> 3637.04
everything is designed everything there

3634.64 --> 3638.72
is no thing not designed

3637.04 --> 3640.24
oh you think it's random well that's

3638.72 --> 3643.2799999999997
because

3640.24 --> 3645.2799999999997
you lack the ability to understand how

3643.28 --> 3648.3190000000004
it is not random

3645.28 --> 3648.88
everything is designed every single

3648.319 --> 3651.2
thing

3648.88 --> 3653.52
the way matter function the setup of the

3651.2 --> 3653.52
realm

3654.839 --> 3657.839
everything

3659.68 --> 3663.52
right as for the flat earth the earth

3662.319 --> 3666.079
being flat that's not an

3663.52 --> 3667.359
uncertainty an uncertain viewpoint

3666.079 --> 3670.6400000000003
either

3667.359 --> 3671.52
yeah we know the geometric orientation

3670.64 --> 3674.8799999999997
of the earth

3671.52 --> 3678.079
surface is absolutely flat

3674.88 --> 3681.359
or as good as flat is absolutely

3678.079 --> 3682.4
as good as flat it's not a ball it's not

3681.359 --> 3685.68
a ball of the

3682.4 --> 3688.0
heliocentric model based size absolutely

3685.68 --> 3693.2
not not even close

3688.0 --> 3693.2
so yeah it is certain that it is flat

3697.44 --> 3702.4
is evil by design yes yes it is

3704.64 --> 3713.839
everything is

3715.28 --> 3727.8390000000004
it was the challenge for the good and

3717.2 --> 3727.839
the good is the challenge for the evil

3729.359 --> 3734.319
how would you know good without evil

3732.16 --> 3737.92
well good without evil is still good

3734.319 --> 3740.799
it's just very simple

3737.92 --> 3744.2400000000002
it's evil that makes it bigger and

3740.799 --> 3744.24
stronger and more passionate

3744.4 --> 3748.2400000000002
and then the same time evil is not

3747.52 --> 3752.839
really

3748.24 --> 3755.9199999999996
evil can be kind of timid but when evil

3752.839 --> 3759.2
gets frustrated

3755.92 --> 3763.28
agitated uh

3759.2 --> 3765.7599999999998
egos bruised jealous all these things

3763.28 --> 3767.119
by good by people that are actually

3765.76 --> 3769.44
measurably

3767.119 --> 3771.52
energy level wise doing better because

3769.44 --> 3774.2400000000002
they're good and they're doing good

3771.52 --> 3784.0
yeah then evil gets more determined to

3774.24 --> 3787.1189999999997
ruin good it's all by design it's all

3784.0 --> 3789.839
cyclical it's all in balance

3787.119 --> 3791.76
and it always becomes always every

3789.839 --> 3796.0789999999997
generation there's good air is evil and

3791.76 --> 3799.8390000000004
you can't

3796.079 --> 3803.28
you can't build it up in a way

3799.839 --> 3806.96
that you can guarantee

3803.28 --> 3810.3190000000004
the choice the people will make

3806.96 --> 3813.2
as they grow up can't guarantee it it is

3810.319 --> 3813.2
impossible

3814.0 --> 3818.799
really it is it's like consider this for

3817.52 --> 3822.96
a moment i suspect

3818.799 --> 3826.4
this is conceptual you have a family

3822.96 --> 3829.839
that is the parents are really good like

3826.4 --> 3829.839
really essentially good like

3829.92 --> 3834.7200000000003
like non-standard christians that are

3832.559 --> 3836.079
all about the esoteric approach they

3834.72 --> 3837.52
really understand the path of christ

3836.079 --> 3839.44
that are really aware of the evil in the

3837.52 --> 3843.359
world of the challenges of all that

3839.44 --> 3843.359
they can all the preparations

3844.079 --> 3850.2400000000002
available for their children there is no

3847.52 --> 3851.359
guarantee that the children will

3850.24 --> 3854.8799999999997
actually

3851.359 --> 3858.319
take that knowledge from you

3854.88 --> 3860.0
and be good as well there's actually

3858.319 --> 3862.079
a chance that they might take an

3860.0 --> 3862.88
opposite position because they feel no

3862.079 --> 3865.52
no there's

3862.88 --> 3866.4
enough good it needs to be balanced out

3865.52 --> 3870.0
that's a

3866.4 --> 3873.599
super subconscious decision that you

3870.0 --> 3876.88
cannot control it's impossible

3873.599 --> 3880.0
you can only hope for the best and sit

3876.88 --> 3881.76
through the test

3880.0 --> 3883.839
right and the same goes the other way

3881.76 --> 3885.92
around fascinatingly enough

3883.839 --> 3887.599
it's creepy though because there is

3885.92 --> 3889.28
people

3887.599 --> 3890.88
whether you want to call them people it

3889.28 --> 3893.119
becomes questionable

3890.88 --> 3894.7200000000003
that are evil and that want just pure

3893.119 --> 3897.039
control and that want to build their own

3894.72 --> 3900.24
little family empire

3897.039 --> 3900.88
and they will mentally and maybe even

3900.24 --> 3903.7599999999998
literally

3900.88 --> 3904.88
torture their own children to reinforce

3903.76 --> 3907.6800000000003
that power

3904.88 --> 3909.44
within them of control and obsession of

3907.68 --> 3910.5589999999997
control and discard everything that's

3909.44 --> 3913.68
good

3910.559 --> 3914.1600000000003
to favor control and power and even

3913.68 --> 3917.2
those

3914.16 --> 3920.96
children there may be

3917.2 --> 3922.72
some that will just like like i am going

3920.96 --> 3926.96
to revenge this

3922.72 --> 3930.24
and then become good and then they do

3926.96 --> 3932.48
and they like become evil but evil

3930.24 --> 3935.0389999999998
against the family because they actually

3932.48 --> 3938.72
want to be good

3935.039 --> 3942.96
is no control

3938.72 --> 3945.4399999999996
over the decision the position

3942.96 --> 3946.319
people will take spiritually as they

3945.44 --> 3951.839
grow up

3946.319 --> 3956.799
you cannot control it it is absolutely

3951.839 --> 3956.799
impossible i know this i know it

3956.96 --> 3959.68
been through it

3963.2 --> 3966.96
it's a challenge every generation must

3965.599 --> 3970.799
face forever

3966.96 --> 3975.839
do you understand for ever

3970.799 --> 3975.839
until the last human dies

3976.839 --> 3979.839
forever

3997.039 --> 4000.559
yeah i know fairly uncompromising isn't

4000.0 --> 4002.799
it

4000.559 --> 4006.6400000000003
is that because i know it's true it's

4002.799 --> 4009.92
one of the things that i just i know

4006.64 --> 4009.92
i know it works like this

4010.319 --> 4016.72
you can't you can't prevent people from

4014.16 --> 4017.5989999999997
spiritually polarizing themselves you

4016.72 --> 4020.64
can't

4017.599 --> 4023.6800000000003
prevent it it's impossible

4020.64 --> 4026.799
unless you highly pressure

4023.68 --> 4030.24
everything to an unreasonable degree and

4026.799 --> 4033.599
i don't think god allows it

4030.24 --> 4038.0789999999997
if you take away the choice then

4033.599 --> 4038.079
god forces the situation

4044.559 --> 4049.8390000000004
just happens

4063.76 --> 4070.96
meaning no free will no

4067.2 --> 4073.7599999999998
no you got it all wrong there dr gonzo i

4070.96 --> 4078.4
mean exactly the opposite

4073.76 --> 4081.599
no it it's exactly no free will no

4078.4 --> 4084.799
no the thing is you don't have a

4081.599 --> 4086.1600000000003
choice to permanently take away free

4084.799 --> 4088.16
will

4086.16 --> 4090.16
that's the restriction on free will you

4088.16 --> 4092.48
do not have the free will to take away

4090.16 --> 4105.839
free will

4092.48 --> 4105.839
that's what i mean

4113.839 --> 4119.839
you can only take it away from yourself

4143.04 --> 4149.679
ah mellow fella just just leave larry to

4145.759 --> 4149.679
march he's just trying to gaslight you

4149.759 --> 4152.4
at this point

4154.56 --> 4161.839000000001
which testament do you subscribe to

4158.56 --> 4161.839000000001
my own

4164.719 --> 4173.52
i do not trust any

4169.199 --> 4176.4
written word but i will look into it

4173.52 --> 4179.679
and then reflect off it reflect off it

4176.4 --> 4183.12
the preponderance of my knowledge

4179.679 --> 4187.279
in language and in the spirit

4183.12 --> 4190.5599999999995
and in humanity and then i will

4187.279 --> 4193.6
point out what is good and what is bad

4190.56 --> 4197.92
and everybody can by the way and does

4193.6 --> 4200.84
do this it's just that

4197.92 --> 4203.84
people don't usually claim it

4200.84 --> 4203.84
consciously

4204.8 --> 4210.56
i don't believe the word of god

4208.0 --> 4213.84
with the little g no less that's very

4210.56 --> 4213.84
cute dr gonzo

4214.4 --> 4220.879999999999
what is the word of god

4217.76 --> 4224.8
i think the word of god is truth right

4220.88 --> 4228.4800000000005
now what is truth truth is not a

4224.8 --> 4231.1990000000005
etched specific piece of text no

4228.48 --> 4232.4
truth is the understanding and the

4231.199 --> 4235.678999999999
insight

4232.4 --> 4235.679
into what is real

4235.76 --> 4242.88
and the challenges that come with it

4239.44 --> 4245.919999999999
the the burden of knowing

4242.88 --> 4248.32
right that burden is god's wording

4245.92 --> 4250.08
and the more we know the more we take on

4248.32 --> 4251.5199999999995
that burden that we were really not

4250.08 --> 4254.239
meant to handle

4251.52 --> 4254.96
it's our limiter it's the thing that

4254.239 --> 4261.12
makes us

4254.96 --> 4261.12
not god a little g at best

4263.199 --> 4269.44
so i see a lot of books as

4266.56 --> 4270.2390000000005
the word of god i'm just not gonna say

4269.44 --> 4273.12
oh because

4270.239 --> 4275.678999999999
certain people are really fanatical and

4273.12 --> 4278.719
they're like oh

4275.679 --> 4282.96
every single letter every single dot

4278.719 --> 4286.8
it in its entirety is one holographic

4282.96 --> 4290.96
divine output right yeah

4286.8 --> 4296.08
no no no god comes through information

4290.96 --> 4299.52
information it's all about understanding

4296.08 --> 4304.32
this esoteric approach it's

4299.52 --> 4307.040000000001
making text into literal icon worship so

4304.32 --> 4309.36
instead of a statue

4307.04 --> 4310.4
that you're gonna worship as a god

4309.36 --> 4312.96
you're taking

4310.4 --> 4314.0
the literal patterns in its entirety in

4312.96 --> 4319.36
a text exactly

4314.0 --> 4322.56
as is to worship as an idol

4319.36 --> 4325.199
instead of god the meaning within

4322.56 --> 4327.1990000000005
which you are supposed to understand

4325.199 --> 4328.639999999999
learn to understand and actually need

4327.199 --> 4332.799999999999
him

4328.64 --> 4337.6
the truth god the word of god in it

4332.8 --> 4340.96
it the piece of paper the exact text

4337.6 --> 4345.52
that is not the word of god

4340.96 --> 4347.719
it's the meaning and the learning within

4345.52 --> 4349.040000000001
and the distinction and the

4347.719 --> 4351.84
confrontation

4349.04 --> 4353.679
the reflection upon it that is the word

4351.84 --> 4357.04
of god

4353.679 --> 4360.8
yeah if you're gonna take a book

4357.04 --> 4363.92
and in its absolute entirety

4360.8 --> 4365.04
demand that you just say this is god and

4363.92 --> 4368.32
if you

4365.04 --> 4370.08
change one thing or if you say anything

4368.32 --> 4373.28
that counters anything within it

4370.08 --> 4376.64
you are evil then you're

4373.28 --> 4380.5599999999995
literally creating an idol

4376.64 --> 4384.0
out of the book to worship and

4380.56 --> 4386.4800000000005
sin for that's my personal

4384.0 --> 4387.6
opinion and it counts for everything and

4386.48 --> 4389.12
with that yeah it

4387.6 --> 4391.04
bled more potentially could be

4389.12 --> 4394.239
considered as a blasphemer against

4391.04 --> 4396.4
all religious doctrines

4394.239 --> 4397.759999999999
because a lot of religious doctrines do

4396.4 --> 4400.719
go there

4397.76 --> 4401.6
i don't i'm a pure as a terrorist i

4400.719 --> 4405.36
reject

4401.6 --> 4409.04
all exoteric understanding

4405.36 --> 4412.48
all of it i reject it all

4409.04 --> 4416.159
now don't not to say that having

4412.48 --> 4419.199
i don't know rituals or traditions

4416.159 --> 4422.08
or masses or something like that that's

4419.199 --> 4424.32
all evil must all go away no no no no

4422.08 --> 4428.4
it's just not

4424.32 --> 4430.4
the actual god that's not that

4428.4 --> 4432.239
it's just a tradition it's a thing it's

4430.4 --> 4433.44
a culture it's something you can do and

4432.239 --> 4437.839999999999
it can be

4433.44 --> 4441.04
used to be focused on god

4437.84 --> 4444.159000000001
time for people those situations

4441.04 --> 4444.64
can be used for that it's it's a social

4444.159 --> 4448.0
thing

4444.64 --> 4450.8
right has nothing to do with the actual

4448.0 --> 4451.92
understanding of god though in my

4450.8 --> 4454.4800000000005
opinion

4451.92 --> 4454.96
could be symbolically representing

4454.48 --> 4458.0
things

4454.96 --> 4460.4
but will that make people understand no

4458.0 --> 4462.64
no it only makes it more mysterious

4460.4 --> 4464.4
gives more tendency to exoteric

4462.64 --> 4465.12
understanding instead of esoteric

4464.4 --> 4467.92
understanding

4465.12 --> 4469.199
because esoteric understanding can only

4467.92 --> 4474.159
be attained

4469.199 --> 4477.36
through communication through reading

4474.159 --> 4479.759999999999
feedback talking about it that's the

4477.36 --> 4483.44
only way it can be attained

4479.76 --> 4485.04
you can't just join rituals or places or

4483.44 --> 4488.239
masses or

4485.04 --> 4489.12
whatever traditions just be there just

4488.239 --> 4491.678999999999
sit through it

4489.12 --> 4492.88
sing a song do a little dance or

4491.679 --> 4495.679
whatever

4492.88 --> 4496.08
and then you are the wiser no no you

4495.679 --> 4498.8
then

4496.08 --> 4501.04
absorbed some of the energy it's a

4498.8 --> 4503.76
social thing and it might provide

4501.04 --> 4504.96
make you relief may provide something

4503.76 --> 4508.159000000001
that is really good for you

4504.96 --> 4508.88
nourishing on a visceral level does it

4508.159 --> 4511.839999999999
make you

4508.88 --> 4511.84
understand god

4512.08 --> 4515.6
that's not something it does might

4514.32 --> 4521.04
reveal some

4515.6 --> 4521.04
peak of glory within life perhaps

4523.52 --> 4530.56
do i don't study communication at uni no

4526.8 --> 4530.56
i've never been to a university

4531.04 --> 4540.159
i've studied communication as a layman

4535.04 --> 4542.8
my entire life very young age on

4540.159 --> 4545.44
like one of like i studied communication

4542.8 --> 4549.4400000000005
before i could properly communicate

4545.44 --> 4549.44
because it was kind of a problem for me

4550.08 --> 4554.64
like i only started speaking when i

4551.92 --> 4556.8
could formulate a full sentence

4554.64 --> 4559.360000000001
like on an adult level that's when i

4556.8 --> 4567.84
started to open my mouth

4559.36 --> 4567.839999999999
to study it a lot before that

4581.52 --> 4586.2390000000005
oh my god larry demarch really

4587.199 --> 4591.28
the context of what he said interpreted

4590.08 --> 4593.6
correctly

4591.28 --> 4595.679
doesn't change the fact he showed earth

4593.6 --> 4599.280000000001
earth oh you mean

4595.679 --> 4602.4
the visual horizon

4599.28 --> 4604.5599999999995
that right now has never been claimed to

4602.4 --> 4609.599999999999
be the geometric

4604.56 --> 4613.04
edge of the earth the curve

4609.6 --> 4614.719
or do do you claim that larry the march

4613.04 --> 4615.679
do you claim that the horizon is

4614.719 --> 4618.8
actually the

4615.679 --> 4620.08
geometric edge of the sphere you're

4618.8 --> 4622.8
looking past

4620.08 --> 4623.36
that you presume you're on remember ball

4622.8 --> 4626.8
earth

4623.36 --> 4629.839999999999
geometric edge so

4626.8 --> 4632.88
the visual did prove

4629.84 --> 4636.4800000000005
that it is earth curve did it

4632.88 --> 4638.159000000001
larry the march

4636.48 --> 4640.799999999999
i'm pretty sure that we've been talking

4638.159 --> 4641.92
like at least two years on a daily basis

4640.8 --> 4646.08
about how it

4641.92 --> 4646.56
isn't but yeah it's very hard to not let

4646.08 --> 4648.5599999999995
it

4646.56 --> 4650.719
let the assumption slip through right

4648.56 --> 4654.0
it's like one of the last

4650.719 --> 4655.6
quick assumptions to uh yeah to the

4654.0 --> 4658.4
earth being a ball i know it's very

4655.6 --> 4658.400000000001
tough to let go

4661.6 --> 4666.8
that's why you share your pain in the

4664.719 --> 4668.32
flat earth debate chat especially in the

4666.8 --> 4671.679
last

4668.32 --> 4674.88
year at least on a regular basis

4671.679 --> 4677.92
but yeah showing

4674.88 --> 4679.4400000000005
earth curved through visual yeah in

4677.92 --> 4681.52
order to do that you would have to

4679.44 --> 4684.879999999999
assume that the horizon

4681.52 --> 4688.320000000001
in the picture is the edge

4684.88 --> 4690.400000000001
of a sphere earth you're looking past

4688.32 --> 4692.32
that is obstructing sight into the

4690.4 --> 4696.0
distance right

4692.32 --> 4699.199
well it isn't

4696.0 --> 4701.52
because if it were then

4699.199 --> 4703.36
certain observations over the earth

4701.52 --> 4704.8
would be impossible

4703.36 --> 4707.04
it would have to be a lot more

4704.8 --> 4711.1990000000005
consistent within observation

4707.04 --> 4712.719
based on the geometric limitations

4711.199 --> 4715.12
of the presumed sphere earth you're

4712.719 --> 4718.2390000000005
standing on but yet

4715.12 --> 4719.44
the black swan observations disprove

4718.239 --> 4722.159
that notion

4719.44 --> 4723.04
disprove that geometry permanently

4722.159 --> 4725.44
connect could

4723.04 --> 4726.56
never be possible on the geometric

4725.44 --> 4729.28
sphere

4726.56 --> 4730.320000000001
could never be possible like that

4729.28 --> 4733.44
there's no

4730.32 --> 4738.159
proven optics empiric based

4733.44 --> 4741.28
proven scientific optics

4738.159 --> 4745.679
that can even

4741.28 --> 4747.5199999999995
yeah create a reason for that to happen

4745.679 --> 4750.4
now terrestrial refraction has been

4747.52 --> 4753.280000000001
conjured up in the trenches

4750.4 --> 4755.12
to kind of fig give a science fiction

4753.28 --> 4758.159
solution to that

4755.12 --> 4761.44
that would just wow the optics the

4758.159 --> 4764.32
mysterious terrestrial refraction just

4761.44 --> 4766.96
bends it all into this mysterious

4764.32 --> 4769.84
extremely flat looking plane

4766.96 --> 4771.6
which is absolutely absurd like the

4769.84 --> 4774.0
optics effect

4771.6 --> 4774.88
it's impossible all optic effects what

4774.0 --> 4779.44
they ever do

4774.88 --> 4783.12
is bend things potentially into seeming

4779.44 --> 4786.48
curves or just angular deviations

4783.12 --> 4791.76
what optics however never

4786.48 --> 4795.159
ever does is unbend

4791.76 --> 4798.08
optics never unbends there is no

4795.159 --> 4799.759999999999
unbending optical effect

4798.08 --> 4801.199
in existence that has ever been

4799.76 --> 4803.679
demonstrated

4801.199 --> 4805.678999999999
right yet that is exactly what

4803.679 --> 4809.1990000000005
terrestrial refraction is

4805.679 --> 4811.679
claimed to do isn't that just

4809.199 --> 4813.199
fascinating right so it's complete

4811.679 --> 4816.4
science fiction

4813.199 --> 4818.239
and besides even within the math

4816.4 --> 4820.799999999999
in which terrestrial refraction is very

4818.239 --> 4821.12
conveniently used by ballers to justify

4820.8 --> 4826.159000000001
the

4821.12 --> 4830.5599999999995
impossible sights it has a

4826.159 --> 4833.759999999999
very infamous notorious radius value

4830.56 --> 4836.8
within the mathematical setup

4833.76 --> 4838.2390000000005
so it actually assumes the specific

4836.8 --> 4842.320000000001
radius of the earth

4838.239 --> 4845.839999999999
within the calculatory process

4842.32 --> 4847.5199999999995
yeah so if you're gonna use terrestrial

4845.84 --> 4853.04
refraction as a last

4847.52 --> 4853.040000000001
ditch resort to prove that the visuals

4853.44 --> 4859.04
are basically still proving the

4856.88 --> 4861.12
the earth to be a ball then you're

4859.04 --> 4865.199
basing that fundamentally

4861.12 --> 4866.159
on the assumed within the calculation

4865.199 --> 4870.5599999999995
system

4866.159 --> 4873.599999999999
r value which makes it a proof

4870.56 --> 4873.84
which makes it a paradox i'm sorry not a

4873.6 --> 4877.1990000000005
pro

4873.84 --> 4879.28
which makes it a paradox

4877.199 --> 4881.919999999999
that you are literally using as a

4879.28 --> 4885.679
foundation to prove the thing

4881.92 --> 4887.52
that it assumes within the calculation

4885.679 --> 4889.4400000000005
nathan oakley has called this the

4887.52 --> 4892.56
arwynian paradox

4889.44 --> 4895.44
very honored to have that

4892.56 --> 4897.1990000000005
have my name associated with this very

4895.44 --> 4900.239
specific

4897.199 --> 4902.638999999999
machination to be

4900.239 --> 4904.32
yeah the one to figure that out i'm

4902.639 --> 4906.32
proud of that in retrospect i was a

4904.32 --> 4909.04
little like weirded out by it first but

4906.32 --> 4909.04
i get it now

4909.199 --> 4917.599999999999
i'm okay with it so yeah

4913.76 --> 4919.6
you got a problem

4917.6 --> 4922.639
as soon as you start to assume that the

4919.6 --> 4926.08
horizon is the geometric edge of a

4922.639 --> 4929.36
sphere of earth then the black swan

4926.08 --> 4932.719
observations immediately disproves

4929.36 --> 4934.96
the geometry of the

4932.719 --> 4944.4
presumed sphere earth immediately

4934.96 --> 4948.32
there's nothing you can do about it

4944.4 --> 4952.239
try have you tried a gyroscope dr gonzo

4948.32 --> 4954.48
a physical one not a laser gyro right

4952.239 --> 4956.5599999999995
because laser jar is something else it

4954.48 --> 4959.919999999999
has this weird

4956.56 --> 4962.159000000001
drift going on it's light because it's

4959.92 --> 4964.719
literally light turning right so

4962.159 --> 4966.799999999999
how about a physical gyroscope because

4964.719 --> 4969.04
physical gyroscopes have

4966.8 --> 4970.320000000001
matter in it it has momentum and it's

4969.04 --> 4973.44
like one of its unique

4970.32 --> 4976.639
unique aspects for physical gyros

4973.44 --> 4977.839999999999
have you ever tried that out ever moved

4976.639 --> 4980.0
across it or just

4977.84 --> 4981.92
let it spin and just let it sit for 24

4980.0 --> 4987.6
hours with the camera on it

4981.92 --> 4989.28
ever seen it oh it doesn't turn a 360

4987.6 --> 4992.4800000000005
degrees over the day

4989.28 --> 4995.5199999999995
oh i'm so surprised it should though

4992.48 --> 4999.44
every freaking physical gyroscope

4995.52 --> 5000.639
in the world should be turning 360

4999.44 --> 5004.48
degrees

5000.639 --> 5007.52
every day all day every day

5004.48 --> 5008.718999999999
forever always if the earth was a

5007.52 --> 5012.400000000001
spinning ball

5008.719 --> 5016.44
every gyroscope every physical gyroscope

5012.4 --> 5019.679
at all times should be turning

5016.44 --> 5022.96
360 degrees as long as they are spinning

5019.679 --> 5025.84
every single physical gyroscope on earth

5022.96 --> 5028.8
if the earth was a spinning ball there's

5025.84 --> 5033.12
no exception there's no justification

5028.8 --> 5033.12
as to why they're not doing that ever

5034.48 --> 5039.599999999999
just stationary stationary gyroscope

5040.159 --> 5044.5599999999995
you know when you go moving around the

5042.8 --> 5045.28
presupposer of the edge should also be

5044.56 --> 5048.8
turning

5045.28 --> 5049.44
right and then the infamous pendulous

5048.8 --> 5052.2390000000005
veins

5049.44 --> 5053.5199999999995
are misconstrued to be supposedly

5052.239 --> 5056.239
accounting for

5053.52 --> 5056.96
the the angular drift which it doesn't

5056.239 --> 5060.879999999999
it just

5056.96 --> 5062.4
accounts for rapid turns rapid turns

5060.88 --> 5064.2390000000005
that's what pendulous veins in

5062.4 --> 5067.04
gyroscopes are for right

5064.239 --> 5068.32
but on a stationary situation on the

5067.04 --> 5070.719
earth

5068.32 --> 5072.799999999999
there is no sudden changes there is no

5070.719 --> 5076.4800000000005
drift

5072.8 --> 5076.96
that is supposedly being account for and

5076.48 --> 5080.638999999999
just

5076.96 --> 5082.639
spins exactly as is 24

5080.639 --> 5084.159000000001
7 forever as long as you keep it

5082.639 --> 5086.32
spinning just keeps on spinning nothing

5084.159 --> 5088.4
is turning about the gyroscope right

5086.32 --> 5090.799999999999
well if we are on a spinning ball it

5088.4 --> 5090.799999999999
should be

5091.04 --> 5100.159
turning 360 degrees

5095.84 --> 5100.159000000001
over a day and it's not

5107.04 --> 5112.0
[Music]

5109.6 --> 5113.1990000000005
oh oh really would you like to

5112.0 --> 5116.48
demonstrate that dr

5113.199 --> 5118.48
gonzo you have a physical gyroscope

5116.48 --> 5120.159
that demonstrates 15 degree per hour

5118.48 --> 5123.759999999999
drift yeah yeah yeah

5120.159 --> 5126.159
per hour yeah case closed

5123.76 --> 5128.4800000000005
i'm gonna close the case around you

5126.159 --> 5128.48
buddy

5128.88 --> 5133.04
can get lost in the airport in that case

5131.28 --> 5135.199
as far as i'm concerned

5133.04 --> 5137.28
because there's no demonstration of this

5135.199 --> 5139.919999999999
not a single time and yeah

5137.28 --> 5140.8
that 15 degrees per hour drift thanks to

5139.92 --> 5143.36
bob yeah

5140.8 --> 5145.4400000000005
that's a ring laser gyroscope it's not a

5143.36 --> 5148.96
physical gyroscope that's why i was

5145.44 --> 5151.44
very specific about the physical

5148.96 --> 5152.159
nature of the gyroscope in this setup

5151.44 --> 5154.32
yeah yeah

5152.159 --> 5155.36
i know you'd like to forget that's very

5154.32 --> 5158.0
easy

5155.36 --> 5158.799999999999
just forget because this ring laser gyro

5158.0 --> 5162.08
thing you did

5158.8 --> 5164.719
there was a drift physical ones don't

5162.08 --> 5166.239
they don't there's no explanation for

5164.719 --> 5168.2390000000005
this it's not being addressed

5166.239 --> 5170.159
you don't like to address it don't do

5168.239 --> 5173.36
you right amen

5170.159 --> 5177.04
dr gonzo it's good enough it's good

5173.36 --> 5179.5199999999995
yeah i know it's good enough any ball

5177.04 --> 5180.159
any proof no matter how flimsy you know

5179.52 --> 5182.8
how

5180.159 --> 5185.759999999999
no matter how ill thought through is

5182.8 --> 5188.56
good enough for you i know

5185.76 --> 5190.96
i know that's why you're a zealot that's

5188.56 --> 5193.04
why i'm not giving you a wrench

5190.96 --> 5194.159
because you are a zealot you know it

5193.04 --> 5197.12
just gave you this

5194.159 --> 5198.32
elaborate information you're just

5197.12 --> 5200.639
ignoring it

5198.32 --> 5202.159
it's because it's good enough for you

5200.639 --> 5203.76
it's just so story it's good enough for

5202.159 --> 5205.28
you you don't need a demonstration to

5203.76 --> 5207.04
know the earth is a ball

5205.28 --> 5208.4
because it's a ball in your head so it

5207.04 --> 5210.4
has to be a ball

5208.4 --> 5213.5199999999995
can be not a ball if it's a ball in your

5210.4 --> 5213.5199999999995
head right right

5215.58 --> 5220.399
[Music]

5221.12 --> 5225.36
yeah dr gamzo the next time you say that

5224.08 --> 5230.5599999999995
i'm gonna ban you

5225.36 --> 5232.799999999999
you know why because it's in the rules

5230.56 --> 5234.0
you apparently didn't read the rules i

5232.8 --> 5236.2390000000005
don't think you're a

5234.0 --> 5237.199
guy that typically reads the rules do

5236.239 --> 5240.638999999999
you

5237.199 --> 5242.48
i don't think you read the rules even

5240.639 --> 5244.400000000001
in the confines of your own belief in

5242.48 --> 5246.638999999999
the areas

5244.4 --> 5248.799999999999
that that takes place in like physics

5246.639 --> 5252.08
you don't really read the rules do you

5248.8 --> 5253.12
dr gonzo don't make a habit of reading

5252.08 --> 5256.159
the rules right

5253.12 --> 5257.5199999999995
but you still insist on being informed

5256.159 --> 5259.199
do you

5257.52 --> 5260.8
yeah well you don't when you don't read

5259.199 --> 5262.96
the rules

5260.8 --> 5265.4400000000005
you can say all kinds of things but you

5262.96 --> 5268.0
wouldn't know

5265.44 --> 5268.879999999999
whether you're actually correct or not

5268.0 --> 5272.48
because you hadn't

5268.88 --> 5275.6
read the rules so yeah

5272.48 --> 5279.04
physical gyroscopes should be

5275.6 --> 5282.4800000000005
drifting 360 degrees

5279.04 --> 5286.48
everywhere on the earth if

5282.48 --> 5289.44
the earth was a spinning ball

5286.48 --> 5290.638999999999
yeah physical gyroscope that ring laser

5289.44 --> 5292.0
gyrus goes that's

5290.639 --> 5293.84
it's not a physical thing it's not the

5292.0 --> 5295.52
same thing there's no physical thing to

5293.84 --> 5298.4800000000005
have a momentum

5295.52 --> 5299.360000000001
in its spin right physical gyroscopes do

5298.48 --> 5301.04
have that effect

5299.36 --> 5305.04
they're notorious for that's why they're

5301.04 --> 5309.04
used for orientation in vehicles in

5305.04 --> 5313.36
ships airplanes physical gyroscopes not

5309.04 --> 5316.4
ring laser gyros physical ones right

5313.36 --> 5319.12
very long time for centuries

5316.4 --> 5320.638999999999
it's like since the 19th century they've

5319.12 --> 5323.36
been used

5320.639 --> 5325.52
because yeah when the chip changes the

5323.36 --> 5327.5199999999995
gyroscope stays in place so

5325.52 --> 5329.92
if you're inside the ship and you're

5327.52 --> 5332.56
disoriented you can see

5329.92 --> 5334.56
on the gyroscope readout what actually

5332.56 --> 5336.639
is level it's super handy because it

5334.56 --> 5340.080000000001
doesn't change its orientation

5336.639 --> 5342.2390000000005
once it spins up right well if you take

5340.08 --> 5345.28
a gyroscope

5342.239 --> 5346.879999999999
and you stick it on a ball

5345.28 --> 5348.84
and you spin that ball while the

5346.88 --> 5350.639
gyroscope is turning guess what the

5348.84 --> 5353.679
gyroscope

5350.639 --> 5355.6
spin orientation is going to stay

5353.679 --> 5357.1990000000005
the same on the ball you can literally

5355.6 --> 5359.92
demonstrate this to yourself

5357.199 --> 5361.44
if you want to or you could just trust

5359.92 --> 5364.639
what you think you know

5361.44 --> 5366.239
that makes the earth ball right

5364.639 --> 5369.04
or you could test this out and then

5366.239 --> 5370.32
you'll see yeah a physical gyroscope

5369.04 --> 5374.639
when spun up

5370.32 --> 5377.679
and moving around the ball

5374.639 --> 5380.32
yeah it shifts it turns

5377.679 --> 5381.12
or rather it does not turn as the ball

5380.32 --> 5384.88
it is on

5381.12 --> 5387.199
is turning because its spin in euclidean

5384.88 --> 5387.92
space is absolutely rigid it's one of

5387.199 --> 5390.08
the unique

5387.92 --> 5391.1990000000005
properties of a gyroscope of a physical

5390.08 --> 5394.48
one right

5391.199 --> 5398.159
that's why they're so useful in ship

5394.48 --> 5401.199
and air travel see air travel

5398.159 --> 5404.239
right because it helps in orientation

5401.199 --> 5407.839999999999
you know exactly what is up what is down

5404.239 --> 5407.839999999999
as long as that thing is spinning

5408.08 --> 5413.28
it's very useful right so

5411.44 --> 5415.839999999999
yeah if the earth was a spinning ball

5413.28 --> 5417.679
then those gyroscopes that have been

5415.84 --> 5419.4400000000005
used for over a century

5417.679 --> 5420.96
more than a century since the 19th

5419.44 --> 5424.159
century

5420.96 --> 5428.56
they would in any stationary situation

5424.159 --> 5432.5599999999995
be turning 360 degrees

5428.56 --> 5436.8
every day physical gyroscopes

5432.56 --> 5440.8
yet they don't you just spin them up

5436.8 --> 5444.320000000001
they'll spin an exactly the same

5440.8 --> 5447.84
angular setup the same axis spin point

5444.32 --> 5449.04
all day long all year long if you keep

5447.84 --> 5450.96
it spitting if you

5449.04 --> 5452.239
keep inserting the energy to keep it

5450.96 --> 5453.92
spinning

5452.239 --> 5456.08
right it's not gonna it's not gonna

5453.92 --> 5458.719
rotate it doesn't rotate you know why

5456.08 --> 5459.199
because the earth is stationary there is

5458.719 --> 5462.4800000000005
no

5459.199 --> 5464.159
earth spin yeah

5462.48 --> 5466.638999999999
but why don't you try to demonstrate

5464.159 --> 5469.679
this for yourself

5466.639 --> 5472.8
yeah not a ring laser gyro right

5469.679 --> 5477.04
physical one right there was no

5472.8 --> 5477.84
lasers when the gyroscopes were being

5477.04 --> 5480.32
used

5477.84 --> 5480.96
yeah there were no lasers in the 19th

5480.32 --> 5484.4
century

5480.96 --> 5486.96
gyroscopes were there though yeah

5484.4 --> 5489.44
so there were gyroscopes not lasers the

5486.96 --> 5491.76
gyroscopes were used

5489.44 --> 5492.48
hell the gyroscopes were even used in

5491.76 --> 5495.12
early

5492.48 --> 5496.5599999999995
airplanes like pretty quickly they were

5495.12 --> 5500.719
used and like this

5496.56 --> 5503.679
propeller person planes the old days

5500.719 --> 5505.12
right used physical gyroscopes because

5503.679 --> 5508.2390000000005
they were so great

5505.12 --> 5512.8
for orientation brilliant such a

5508.239 --> 5515.04
simple mechanism so effective

5512.8 --> 5515.04
right

5516.96 --> 5522.32
oh yeah yeah oh we need a physical like

5520.4 --> 5525.12
this oh so we need

5522.32 --> 5527.12
some more complicated [ __ ] on top let

5525.12 --> 5528.96
this just up the technology let's just

5527.12 --> 5531.12
call it a gyroscope but you don't get to

5528.96 --> 5533.44
see anything about it anymore and just

5531.12 --> 5534.5599999999995
it will just have a readout that tells

5533.44 --> 5536.48
you

5534.56 --> 5537.92
that it's drifting right doesn't do that

5536.48 --> 5540.879999999999
let's just tell yeah yeah

5537.92 --> 5542.8
once you inquire you'll have a special

5540.88 --> 5544.400000000001
readout that'll tell you don't worry the

5542.8 --> 5547.76
earth is still spinning

5544.4 --> 5550.4
even though this thing is not drifting

5547.76 --> 5553.4400000000005
360 degrees in a day

5550.4 --> 5555.759999999999
yeah i'll bet you they'll have that [ __ ]

5553.44 --> 5557.28
ready in no time too many questions are

5555.76 --> 5560.320000000001
asked

5557.28 --> 5562.48
but yeah in reality physical

5560.32 --> 5565.28
regular gyroscopes that don't have to be

5562.48 --> 5566.718999999999
all super high techy and all special boy

5565.28 --> 5569.12
and expensive right

5566.719 --> 5570.639
just a physical gyroscope can be a very

5569.12 --> 5574.96
cheap thing

5570.639 --> 5577.92
guess what it's not gonna drift 360

5574.96 --> 5580.639
degrees over a day

5577.92 --> 5581.4400000000005
it's not gonna do that why don't you try

5580.639 --> 5584.2390000000005
it out

5581.44 --> 5586.799999999999
or don't you want to find out don't you

5584.239 --> 5589.759999999999
want to know is that it

5586.8 --> 5591.92
just frustrated and spouting your ball

5589.76 --> 5595.12
beliefs continually

5591.92 --> 5596.4800000000005
not actually wanting to try out whether

5595.12 --> 5598.48
it is spinning or not

5596.48 --> 5599.678999999999
you don't want to know you just want

5598.48 --> 5601.44
information

5599.679 --> 5603.36
that will reinforce the belief in your

5601.44 --> 5605.199
head that it's spinning don't you

5603.36 --> 5607.12
you don't really want to find out you

5605.199 --> 5607.839999999999
don't really want to know with certainty

5607.12 --> 5609.92
what's this

5607.84 --> 5611.1990000000005
what's the scenario what is real you

5609.92 --> 5614.32
don't want to know

5611.199 --> 5617.5199999999995
you just want to hear

5614.32 --> 5620.5599999999995
what is the most efficient thing to say

5617.52 --> 5624.639
and believe to reinforce

5620.56 --> 5631.6
the belief the religious conviction

5624.639 --> 5635.1990000000005
that the earth is a spinning ball

5631.6 --> 5636.51
yeah so yeah ballers you go squirt in my

5635.199 --> 5639.629
chat for a while

5636.51 --> 5639.629
[Music]

5642.96 --> 5659.84
i'll be back in two minutes

5670.84 --> 5673.84
so

5684.84 --> 5687.84
so

5698.84 --> 5701.84
so

5712.84 --> 5715.84
so

5726.8 --> 5735.76
oh i'm so uncomfortable and fanatical

5730.88 --> 5739.4400000000005
are you hearing that people in chat

5735.76 --> 5740.8
tiny wombo now calls me uncompromising

5739.44 --> 5743.839999999999
and fanatical

5740.8 --> 5743.84
it's brilliant

5747.6 --> 5754.320000000001
because yeah so why why wouldn't i

5751.36 --> 5754.32
compromise

5754.56 --> 5761.360000000001
about the physical gyroscopes not

5757.679 --> 5763.4400000000005
turning 360 degrees in a day

5761.36 --> 5764.96
right when you're supposed to be a

5763.44 --> 5768.159
spinning ball and that

5764.96 --> 5770.2390000000005
if you take a little gyroscope and you

5768.159 --> 5773.719
put it on a ball

5770.239 --> 5776.4
and then you turn that ball

5773.719 --> 5778.2390000000005
360 degrees yeah the gyroscope's

5776.4 --> 5779.839999999999
orientation like the spinning thing

5778.239 --> 5782.4
within

5779.84 --> 5783.4400000000005
even though it's stuck with its frame to

5782.4 --> 5787.839999999999
that ball

5783.44 --> 5790.879999999999
it's gonna stay exactly in place

5787.84 --> 5793.92
as it turns around it

5790.88 --> 5797.36
right because the spin orientation is

5793.92 --> 5801.1990000000005
rigid it stays in its exact

5797.36 --> 5801.839999999999
angular position that's what gyroscopes

5801.199 --> 5803.678999999999
do is what

5801.84 --> 5805.92
physical gyroscopes do is what makes

5803.679 --> 5806.719
them so unique that ability that once

5805.92 --> 5809.84
they stop

5806.719 --> 5813.04
go spinning they're rigid in its

5809.84 --> 5816.159000000001
angular position the axis

5813.04 --> 5819.36
of the spin stays exactly

5816.159 --> 5821.36
as is no matter what you do with it you

5819.36 --> 5823.44
take the thing it's in you turn it

5821.36 --> 5823.839999999999
around yeah the axis of spin is going to

5823.44 --> 5827.44
stay

5823.84 --> 5828.08
exactly the same that's what a gyroscope

5827.44 --> 5831.5199999999995
does so

5828.08 --> 5834.4
if it were turning

5831.52 --> 5836.0
around the ball very big ball right the

5834.4 --> 5838.0
ball we're supposed to be standing on

5836.0 --> 5841.52
that big ball earth right

5838.0 --> 5844.88
spinning 360 degrees in 24 hours

5841.52 --> 5848.8
well guess what in those 24 hours that

5844.88 --> 5850.56
physical gyroscope stuck on the earth

5848.8 --> 5852.0
the supposed spinning bow earth no

5850.56 --> 5855.360000000001
matter where it is

5852.0 --> 5858.8
there's going to be an apparent

5855.36 --> 5861.599999999999
axial shift because it's kind of like

5858.8 --> 5866.400000000001
coriolis

5861.6 --> 5869.679
the earth is turning underneath

5866.4 --> 5872.638999999999
the gyroscope

5869.679 --> 5872.639
the gyroscope

5872.719 --> 5877.76
is actually the thing that is the axis

5875.44 --> 5879.839999999999
of the gyroscope is rigid

5877.76 --> 5882.719
in the euclidean sense now if the earth

5879.84 --> 5886.0
was spinning underneath

5882.719 --> 5890.4
the gyroscope then you would

5886.0 --> 5893.6
see the gyroscope drift 360 degrees

5890.4 --> 5895.199
over a day which is the kind of coriolis

5893.6 --> 5896.159000000001
base because it's actually the earth

5895.199 --> 5899.678999999999
turning underneath

5896.159 --> 5902.159
it 360 degrees as the

5899.679 --> 5903.84
spinning gyroscope stays rigid in

5902.159 --> 5907.119
euclidean space

5903.84 --> 5909.04
which is a distinct unique property of

5907.119 --> 5912.32
gyroscopes physical ones

5909.04 --> 5916.239
physical gyroscopes stay

5912.32 --> 5918.799999999999
in exact same angular

5916.239 --> 5920.239
position in euclidean space no matter

5918.8 --> 5922.0
what happens to it as long as they are

5920.239 --> 5924.48
spinning that's their unique property

5922.0 --> 5926.08
right so if the earth was spinning

5924.48 --> 5928.959999999999
underneath that

5926.08 --> 5930.5599999999995
the gyroscope to the person standing on

5928.96 --> 5933.199
the spinning earth

5930.56 --> 5936.159000000001
yeah the gyroscope would appear to

5933.199 --> 5937.839999999999
rotate 360 degrees on

5936.159 --> 5940.4
the spinning earth because of

5937.84 --> 5943.52
coriolis-like effect

5940.4 --> 5944.159
right and the gyroscope ability of

5943.52 --> 5947.52
staying

5944.159 --> 5950.638999999999
rigid in euclidean space with its

5947.52 --> 5952.400000000001
rotation axis well guess what the

5950.639 --> 5957.76
physical gyroscopes

5952.4 --> 5961.679
don't spin 360 degrees

5957.76 --> 5965.360000000001
because of coriolis effect on this earth

5961.679 --> 5967.679
because the earth is not a spinning ball

5965.36 --> 5969.679
yeah i know you really don't like

5967.679 --> 5972.8
hearing that

5969.679 --> 5975.119
but it's true and the funny thing is

5972.8 --> 5976.0
this is one of the easier things you can

5975.119 --> 5980.0
actually

5976.0 --> 5983.119
test yourself you don't have to be

5980.0 --> 5985.6
rich to test this gyroscopes are not

5983.119 --> 5989.92
even that expensive

5985.6 --> 5993.4400000000005
but the effect they have is absolutely

5989.92 --> 5997.36
confirmed and known and accepted

5993.44 --> 5998.239
in every circle in every circle every

5997.36 --> 6000.96
physicist

5998.239 --> 6001.919999999999
knows this every real physicist knows

6000.96 --> 6006.08
this

6001.92 --> 6008.32
that physical gyroscopes stay

6006.08 --> 6010.48
rigid with theirs with their rotation

6008.32 --> 6013.679
axis no matter what happens to

6010.48 --> 6014.48
the gyroscope they know this right it's

6013.679 --> 6017.6
a well-known

6014.48 --> 6021.199
fact you can't really debate that

6017.6 --> 6023.84
that is an ability that gyroscopes have

6021.199 --> 6026.08
has been widely known for centuries that

6023.84 --> 6027.28
gyroscopes have this very specific

6026.08 --> 6030.159
ability

6027.28 --> 6031.92
so with that knowledge you can test it

6030.159 --> 6035.44
out yourself you can get a

6031.92 --> 6037.84
very cheap ass little gyroscope

6035.44 --> 6038.5599999999995
hopefully with like a small battery

6037.84 --> 6041.76
motor

6038.56 --> 6042.56
or maybe you could plug it in to keep it

6041.76 --> 6044.320000000001
spinning

6042.56 --> 6046.400000000001
because it has to be yeah it has to be

6044.32 --> 6049.5199999999995
kept spinning fast enough

6046.4 --> 6052.4
for yeah the the gyroscope rigidity

6049.52 --> 6054.320000000001
and the the actual rigidity to set in

6052.4 --> 6055.92
has to spin fast enough it has to keep

6054.32 --> 6056.799999999999
spinning fast enough for that to keep

6055.92 --> 6058.4
happening

6056.8 --> 6061.92
right so it's very cheap i think you can

6058.4 --> 6064.08
get those things for like 50 or 80 euros

6061.92 --> 6065.4400000000005
seen that like years ago and people have

6064.08 --> 6068.48
done that

6065.44 --> 6069.919999999999
and just put that thing in their house

6068.48 --> 6072.0
to keep it spinning

6069.92 --> 6074.639
come back from work hey it's still the

6072.0 --> 6076.08
same still the same angle of spin

6074.639 --> 6077.84
where they put a camera next to it yeah

6076.08 --> 6079.92
it's the same angle of spin oh yeah it's

6077.84 --> 6081.679
the same angle of spin oh it's always

6079.92 --> 6084.32
the same angle of fin

6081.679 --> 6085.84
how could that be well only one

6084.32 --> 6089.759999999999
explanation

6085.84 --> 6093.360000000001
earth is not spinning stationary

6089.76 --> 6094.0
yeah now it's very tough it's so tough

6093.36 --> 6095.36
you know

6094.0 --> 6097.6
this thing has been figured out for

6095.36 --> 6100.88
centuries how could this be

6097.6 --> 6102.96
it's because you've grown up in a world

6100.88 --> 6104.0
where you've been indoctrinated through

6102.96 --> 6107.28
books

6104.0 --> 6109.04
through media through teachers perhaps

6107.28 --> 6111.04
even through your parents that were

6109.04 --> 6113.6
themselves were indoctrinated

6111.04 --> 6115.5199999999995
so they just believed it just told you

6113.6 --> 6118.400000000001
no it's a spinning ball

6115.52 --> 6120.159000000001
don't look at the gyroscope don't listen

6118.4 --> 6122.5599999999995
to those physicists

6120.159 --> 6124.48
talking about their science right when

6122.56 --> 6126.0
it's not convenient and it's just stupid

6124.48 --> 6128.638999999999
science right

6126.0 --> 6130.56
yeah yeah the earth is flat and

6128.639 --> 6133.76
stationary

6130.56 --> 6136.88
and you believe it's a ball and just

6133.76 --> 6139.92
gave you a very simple test that is not

6136.88 --> 6143.119
even that expensive that you can do

6139.92 --> 6145.92
without much loss to prove that

6143.119 --> 6147.119
to yourself that the earth is actually

6145.92 --> 6149.4400000000005
not spinning

6147.119 --> 6151.36
by spinning up a gyroscope keeping it

6149.44 --> 6154.96
spin up

6151.36 --> 6157.36
all day long and then notice

6154.96 --> 6158.08
it's not turning it's not turning how

6157.36 --> 6160.88
can this be

6158.08 --> 6163.84
why is it not turning yes because you're

6160.88 --> 6163.84
earth is stationary

6174.32 --> 6178.88
yeah you are not welcome here get the

6176.48 --> 6178.879999999999
[ __ ] out

6183.84 --> 6188.719
all right so anybody that's going to say

6186.56 --> 6191.679
in my chat

6188.719 --> 6192.2390000000005
the earth is spinning and that bob

6191.679 --> 6195.52
proves

6192.239 --> 6196.718999999999
gyroscopes and the spinning earth and

6195.52 --> 6199.4400000000005
all that yeah yeah

6196.719 --> 6200.4
you now you're gonna get banned gonna

6199.44 --> 6203.199
spend the next

6200.4 --> 6205.199
10 to 15 minutes banning people that

6203.199 --> 6208.32
after me

6205.199 --> 6209.28
having pretty much discussed this in the

6208.32 --> 6212.5599999999995
most

6209.28 --> 6214.159
detail possible white earth is not

6212.56 --> 6217.52
spinning for the last

6214.159 --> 6218.5599999999995
hour yeah anybody that's going to insert

6217.52 --> 6221.4400000000005
some really

6218.56 --> 6223.52
[ __ ] dumbbell [ __ ] about the earth

6221.44 --> 6226.719
still spinning or that bob proved it

6223.52 --> 6230.400000000001
they're just going to get banned now

6226.719 --> 6233.119
yeah yeah it's not okay

6230.4 --> 6234.159
after somebody put down a meticulous

6233.119 --> 6238.4
explanation

6234.159 --> 6239.92
and proof yeah with many many examples

6238.4 --> 6243.119
for prolonged time

6239.92 --> 6246.8
to just shove that all aside and take

6243.119 --> 6247.839999999999
a big globe shaped dump in front of me

6246.8 --> 6251.6
in my chat

6247.84 --> 6252.2390000000005
that's not okay that's me going to ban

6251.6 --> 6261.84
you

6252.239 --> 6261.839999999999
you understand that

6264.32 --> 6268.88
it's not a good point it's [ __ ]

6266.32 --> 6271.44
[ __ ] dr gonzo

6268.88 --> 6273.92
he said freaking bull proofed the spin

6271.44 --> 6275.28
of the earth through his ring laser gyro

6273.92 --> 6276.4
yeah that's not what we were talking

6275.28 --> 6278.719
about though

6276.4 --> 6280.08
ring laser gyros are not physical

6278.719 --> 6282.639
gyroscopes

6280.08 --> 6285.28
what he proved is freaking light turns

6282.639 --> 6288.400000000001
360 degrees yeah yeah well there are

6285.28 --> 6291.5199999999995
lights turning 360 degrees out there

6288.4 --> 6292.4
so why not sure lights are turning 360

6291.52 --> 6294.56
degrees

6292.4 --> 6296.638999999999
but yeah ring laser gyroscopes don't

6294.56 --> 6300.8
have that unique

6296.639 --> 6304.159000000001
effect of physical

6300.8 --> 6304.96
spin momentum rigidity in euclidean

6304.159 --> 6307.599999999999
space yeah

6304.96 --> 6309.119
english gyros don't work like that so

6307.6 --> 6310.0
you can't use that a ring laser

6309.119 --> 6313.599999999999
gyroscope

6310.0 --> 6316.48
is not the same as a physical gyroscope

6313.6 --> 6318.320000000001
yeah so it's very cute that you love to

6316.48 --> 6320.159
bring forth that type of gyroscope

6318.32 --> 6323.92
because that type of gyroscope

6320.159 --> 6326.638999999999
doesn't have all that inconvenient

6323.92 --> 6327.4400000000005
angular rigidity within euclidean space

6326.639 --> 6330.96
i know

6327.44 --> 6333.28
i know you all hate the actual

6330.96 --> 6334.8
spinning ball in the frame right which

6333.28 --> 6338.0
is what the gyroscope is

6334.8 --> 6339.76
you hate the actual spinning ball that

6338.0 --> 6342.56
ball is spinning

6339.76 --> 6344.96
yeah it's spinning a gyroscope is an

6342.56 --> 6348.080000000001
actual spinning ball

6344.96 --> 6350.08
yeah isn't it funny how your actual

6348.08 --> 6352.96
spinning ball

6350.08 --> 6354.88
this proves your spinning ball in your

6352.96 --> 6357.44
head that you think you're standing on

6354.88 --> 6358.2390000000005
isn't that just ironic you hate it you

6357.44 --> 6361.36
hate

6358.239 --> 6363.44
the actual spinning ball you hate it you

6361.36 --> 6366.639
want the ring laser gyro

6363.44 --> 6367.919999999999
you want lights supposedly proving the

6366.639 --> 6370.8
spin of the earth right

6367.92 --> 6371.52
right i know you want that i know you

6370.8 --> 6374.0
want that

6371.52 --> 6375.76
but yeah you see if the earth was a

6374.0 --> 6378.56
spinning ball

6375.76 --> 6380.56
then the actual spinning ball we know as

6378.56 --> 6384.159000000001
physical gyroscopes

6380.56 --> 6387.1990000000005
it would turn 360 degrees over the day

6384.159 --> 6388.799999999999
and it doesn't yeah your ring laser

6387.199 --> 6391.919999999999
gyroscope

6388.8 --> 6392.639
does not have any significance in the

6391.92 --> 6395.119
face of that

6392.639 --> 6397.1990000000005
doesn't matter what it did if the earth

6395.119 --> 6399.759999999999
were spinning all physical gyroscopes

6397.199 --> 6403.36
should be turning 360 degrees

6399.76 --> 6405.84
over the course of a day and they don't

6403.36 --> 6408.08
none of them do you cannot demonstrate

6405.84 --> 6408.08
this

6408.4 --> 6412.239
and i don't give a [ __ ] how a ring laser

6410.639 --> 6414.4800000000005
gyroscope works

6412.239 --> 6416.0
because that's not the subject i'm

6414.48 --> 6417.04
talking about right now i'm talking

6416.0 --> 6421.0
about

6417.04 --> 6423.76
actual physically provable

6421.0 --> 6425.44
demonstrable spinning balls known as

6423.76 --> 6427.119000000001
physical gyroscopes

6425.44 --> 6430.4
that's what i'm talking about i'm not

6427.119 --> 6432.5599999999995
talking about ring laser gyroscopes

6430.4 --> 6434.32
yeah because i don't care it doesn't

6432.56 --> 6437.1990000000005
prove anything it just proves things

6434.32 --> 6438.5599999999995
relating to light which is not really

6437.199 --> 6442.239
relevant

6438.56 --> 6444.56
to the geometrical orientation and

6442.239 --> 6445.919999999999
motion nature of the realm we're

6444.56 --> 6448.8
standing in

6445.92 --> 6450.4
yeah there's no no proof no relation to

6448.8 --> 6452.719
that whatsoever

6450.4 --> 6453.44
physical gyroscope so you know the

6452.719 --> 6457.28
actual

6453.44 --> 6460.719
spinning ball they do they do

6457.28 --> 6464.08
yeah it's funny isn't it

6460.719 --> 6465.76
how ballers that dedicate half or more

6464.08 --> 6466.719
of their life their entire life their

6465.76 --> 6468.639
mind

6466.719 --> 6471.199
to the belief that the earth is a

6468.639 --> 6475.1990000000005
spinning ball that they

6471.199 --> 6478.4
hate hate despise do not want to address

6475.199 --> 6481.839999999999
one to forget about as much as possible

6478.4 --> 6482.799999999999
actual physical spinning balls they hate

6481.84 --> 6485.92
it

6482.8 --> 6488.400000000001
isn't that just ironic isn't that just

6485.92 --> 6488.4
special

6496.84 --> 6499.84
right

6508.21 --> 6512.0
[Music]

6510.4 --> 6513.679
yeah you're not gonna you don't know

6512.0 --> 6516.0
anything about gyros yeah well you're

6513.679 --> 6517.92
not gonna find out are you

6516.0 --> 6519.679
even though i just explained all this

6517.92 --> 6522.32
you're not gonna look into that

6519.679 --> 6523.36
because that's gonna be very tough to

6522.32 --> 6526.08
uphold your

6523.36 --> 6527.92
spinning ball belief once you actually

6526.08 --> 6529.76
dig into that knowledge is it

6527.92 --> 6531.84
it's going to be very tough so yeah no

6529.76 --> 6534.88
no surprise there that you don't know

6531.84 --> 6537.1990000000005
anything about it you should know

6534.88 --> 6539.28
something about it

6537.199 --> 6540.5599999999995
like flat earthers have been talking

6539.28 --> 6543.36
about this for five

6540.56 --> 6545.280000000001
years it's like in 2015 this sort of

6543.36 --> 6547.36
stuff was brought forth

6545.28 --> 6549.28
right because it's there yeah you may

6547.36 --> 6551.44
not be able to use it in some kind of

6549.28 --> 6556.239
scientific hypothesis

6551.44 --> 6559.598999999999
to prove scientifically but yeah the

6556.239 --> 6561.839999999999
axial rigidity of giant physical

6559.599 --> 6565.1990000000005
gyroscopes in euclidean space

6561.84 --> 6567.1990000000005
is a well-known and demonstrable fact

6565.199 --> 6570.0
it's a fact it's been demonstrated it's

6567.199 --> 6572.32
been very much proven for a very long

6570.0 --> 6572.32
time

6572.8 --> 6577.599
and so yeah that natural fact could

6575.76 --> 6580.4800000000005
still be utilized to

6577.599 --> 6580.8
demonstrate why the earth we're standing

6580.48 --> 6584.0
on

6580.8 --> 6585.92
is not a spinning ball right

6584.0 --> 6587.679
might not be scientific but it's

6585.92 --> 6597.84
absolute fact

6587.679 --> 6597.84
can demonstrate it yourself

6617.44 --> 6620.719
i don't see the point of that jimi

6619.28 --> 6624.48
hendrix

6620.719 --> 6625.92
is really pointless because airlines

6624.48 --> 6628.638999999999
have been using

6625.92 --> 6630.159
mechanical gyroscopes for a very very

6628.639 --> 6632.32
long time lasers

6630.159 --> 6633.5199999999995
have only been invented in the 20th

6632.32 --> 6636.5599999999995
century

6633.52 --> 6639.52
gyroscopes were already in use in the

6636.56 --> 6643.679
19th century

6639.52 --> 6647.1990000000005
so how what's the point

6643.679 --> 6652.0
just because a device using lasers

6647.199 --> 6656.0
has replaced regular gyroscopes

6652.0 --> 6658.88
does that mean that regular gyroscopes

6656.0 --> 6660.44
they're just they don't work they were

6658.88 --> 6662.96
replaced because they had this

6660.44 --> 6664.239
inconvenience to them no no they worked

6662.96 --> 6667.84
perfectly

6664.239 --> 6670.0
there might be some like

6667.84 --> 6671.28
because it is a spinning thing there may

6670.0 --> 6674.4
be i don't know

6671.28 --> 6676.639
metal fatigue eventually or something or

6674.4 --> 6678.4
the rust i don't know there might be

6676.639 --> 6679.679
issues with it because they are moving

6678.4 --> 6681.44
parts after all

6679.679 --> 6683.04
so they might have just preferred the

6681.44 --> 6685.598999999999
technological

6683.04 --> 6687.84
ring laser gyroscope which has no moving

6685.599 --> 6691.4400000000005
parts

6687.84 --> 6694.719
i think does it no it should have

6691.44 --> 6697.28
but less whatever they just switched

6694.719 --> 6698.56
precision well how much precision do you

6697.28 --> 6700.639
need

6698.56 --> 6702.56
right yeah ring laser gyros may be more

6700.639 --> 6705.1990000000005
precise

6702.56 --> 6706.320000000001
but yeah that doesn't really matter

6705.199 --> 6710.0
whether it is

6706.32 --> 6713.28
more precise or not for the function

6710.0 --> 6715.92
of the earth spinning or not because

6713.28 --> 6721.04
there would be this 360 degree

6715.92 --> 6725.76
rotation of physical gyroscopes you know

6721.04 --> 6728.4
yeah you know that well there weren't

6725.76 --> 6730.599
there was no 360 degree spin in

6728.4 --> 6734.32
gyroscopes

6730.599 --> 6737.119000000001
utilized in ships

6734.32 --> 6739.36
and in airplanes before the ring laser

6737.119 --> 6741.92
gyroscope was invented

6739.36 --> 6741.92
understand

6746.08 --> 6749.28
right so i'm gonna round out the show

6747.679 --> 6751.4400000000005
because the chat's just gonna keep on

6749.28 --> 6754.719
squirting and denying this [ __ ]

6751.44 --> 6756.4
for the next two hours if i let them

6754.719 --> 6758.8
they're never gonna learn but i hope

6756.4 --> 6760.96
that people that are listening

6758.8 --> 6762.56
do pick up on this because this is this

6760.96 --> 6765.199
is kind of old news this

6762.56 --> 6767.04
was i was saying this sort of thing

6765.199 --> 6770.5599999999995
three years ago

6767.04 --> 6772.32
they just don't listen they don't listen

6770.56 --> 6774.56
they didn't even know what a ring laser

6772.32 --> 6776.239
gyroscope was back then the ballers were

6774.56 --> 6778.4800000000005
not even

6776.239 --> 6780.48
referring to that back then they didn't

6778.48 --> 6783.44
know what that had existed

6780.48 --> 6787.678999999999
they still denied it though they still

6783.44 --> 6787.678999999999
denied about the physical gyroscope

6789.44 --> 6793.5199999999995
so yeah now you just have your ring

6791.36 --> 6795.28
laser gyroscope and bob supposedly

6793.52 --> 6795.679
utilizing it to prove the spin of the

6795.28 --> 6798.32
earth

6795.679 --> 6800.56
which it didn't i didn't even get into

6798.32 --> 6802.639
why it doesn't i've talked about that so

6800.56 --> 6804.88
many times i'm getting kind of sick of

6802.639 --> 6807.4400000000005
bringing it up just because you guys are

6804.88 --> 6810.08
absolute retards

6807.44 --> 6810.719
because you are you are [ __ ] and my

6810.08 --> 6813.199
patience

6810.719 --> 6814.0
with ball zealots is running out very

6813.199 --> 6817.36
much

6814.0 --> 6820.8
running out i'm sick of you now

6817.36 --> 6822.5599999999995
right so maybe it's better to just round

6820.8 --> 6823.92
out the show before i start batting your

6822.56 --> 6827.84
asses

6823.92 --> 6827.84
dr gonzo mn

6828.4 --> 6831.759999999999
ghost of jimi hendrix

6833.119 --> 6836.4
you're all a bunch of ball zealot

6835.52 --> 6839.599
retards

6836.4 --> 6842.32
that's what you are all right

6839.599 --> 6843.360000000001
but despite that thank you very much for

6842.32 --> 6845.36
coming

6843.36 --> 6846.5599999999995
if you like the show please don't forget

6845.36 --> 6848.48
to real guns it up

6846.56 --> 6851.280000000001
and if you haven't already subscribe to

6848.48 --> 6853.28
my channel hit the bell notification

6851.28 --> 6855.5199999999995
bell notification so you know when i'm

6853.28 --> 6857.759999999999
going live which is normally 1 p.m

6855.52 --> 6859.52
amsterdam time every weekday and 2 p.m

6857.76 --> 6862.56
amsterdam time in the weekends

6859.52 --> 6865.92
and please also do support me through

6862.56 --> 6867.76

6865.92 --> 6869.28
super chat and the membership system

6867.76 --> 6871.04
join button that would be much

6869.28 --> 6874.159
appreciated

6871.04 --> 6877.119
uh i will be back tomorrow on

6874.159 --> 6877.598999999999
saturday edition 2 p.m amsterdam time i

6877.119 --> 6879.44
think

6877.599 --> 6880.719
might start earlier i don't know with

6879.44 --> 6883.919999999999
this weather

6880.719 --> 6886.0
do get up easily

6883.92 --> 6886.96
the other nice sunlight i'll be back

6886.0 --> 6888.639
tomorrow

6886.96 --> 6890.0
on the saturday edition and i'm going to

6888.639 --> 6893.679
join the flat earth debates

6890.0 --> 6893.679
which should start up any minute now

6894.08 --> 6898.719
until the next video keep it

6899.92 --> 6904.46
[Music]

6902.84 --> 6930.27
flat

6904.46 --> 6930.27
[Music]

6934.8 --> 6936.88
you
