8.77 --> 43.59
[Music]

39.86 --> 48.33
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

43.59 --> 49.11
early-bird number 169 13 squared I'm

48.33 --> 52.53
your host

49.11 --> 54.6
Arwen and before we start the show

52.53 --> 58.02
please don't forget to share it share

54.6 --> 59.61
share share and subscribe to my channel

58.02 --> 61.11
if you haven't already and hit the bell

59.61 --> 64.65
notification so you know when I'm going

61.11 --> 70.71
life which is normally 2 o'clock p.m.

64.65 --> 79.05000000000001
Amsterdam time right so yeah today the

70.71 --> 83.55
weather is clouded kind of cold it's not

79.05 --> 92.22
too windy though but I know another day

83.55 --> 96.78
another type of weather but yeah Magpies

92.22 --> 101.58
being very active give them some fresh

96.78 --> 110.61
water and some bread remnants they get

101.58 --> 113.46
off row lucky so yeah I was just

110.61 --> 121.86
watching Jose's hangout from yesterday I

113.46 --> 124.11
popped in at some point and yeah seeing

121.86 --> 126.84
it back it was really disappointing

124.11 --> 129.69
actually not because of my performance

126.84 --> 132.299
because I I was trying something else

129.69 --> 132.81
out I was trying not to get really

132.299 --> 137.67000000000002
shouty

132.81 --> 140.9
and dominant like I just wasn't in that

137.67 --> 143.7
mood I just wanted to keep my focus and

140.9 --> 145.799
explain certain details wait for my time

143.7 --> 148.01899999999998
but rompers was constantly interrupting

145.799 --> 150.15
me and I thought ok if I just keep on

148.019 --> 152.19
talking we'll be audible at the same

150.15 --> 153.03
time people will be able to make out

152.19 --> 156.0
what I'm saying

153.03 --> 160.35
well I was wrong and that really sucked

156.0 --> 163.14
because I my sound track didn't have

160.35 --> 165.63
priority for some reason other people

163.14 --> 166.39999999999998
for example like Chris if he spoke and

165.63 --> 169.60999999999999
other people

166.4 --> 171.37900000000002
speak over him you would still be able

169.61 --> 173.66000000000003
to hear them and the others would be

171.379 --> 176.72
kind of a in the background but every

173.66 --> 180.2
time I spoke I would just be completely

176.72 --> 182.989
phased out it was very annoying because

180.2 --> 186.26
his rumpus was literally interrupting

182.989 --> 192.62
every single sentence I made every

186.26 --> 195.04899999999998
single one of them so yeah I know I was

192.62 --> 199.28
making a good point but if you wouldn't

195.049 --> 200.81
know exactly what my point was then you

199.28 --> 202.549
would barely hear what I was talking

200.81 --> 206.9
about it was really annoying and

202.549 --> 211.19
disappointing so I'm kind of agitated

206.9 --> 213.31900000000002
about that little guess the next time

211.19 --> 218.51
I'm on a panel with rhombus I will have

213.319 --> 221.69
to yell or demand Jose just literally

218.51 --> 231.04
mute everyone so I can make my point and

221.69 --> 236.66
finish so how are you guys all doing

231.04 --> 239.2
series in chat ajm was there very early

236.66 --> 244.48
righteous forced friend

239.2 --> 252.23
m-mama cloud Gator fish glasha over moco

244.48 --> 258.769
misty coke Nitti and ripped a ribbon to

252.23 --> 269.65
- ooh I'm Rick's j-mac so on say a 1984

258.769 --> 274.4
Rick Dawkins arena Columbo gleam leb yes

269.65 --> 279.82
so are you guys all doing let's see what

274.4 --> 287.17999999999995
was happening after yesterday I was

279.82 --> 289.3
waiting right yeah the debates I was

287.18 --> 292.509
very late at the debates I think I

289.3 --> 299.02000000000004
barely said a thing

292.509 --> 305.309
I was kind of tired out what else was

299.02 --> 309.18
there some comment back and forth oh

305.309 --> 313.65900000000005
yeah I've been kind of following Crowder

309.18 --> 321.879
but yeah it's okay it's just I don't

313.659 --> 323.349
know okay it's still far away for me but

321.879 --> 325.21000000000004
I'm still gonna keep track of what he's

323.349 --> 327.069
doing because a lot of people seem to be

325.21 --> 330.68899999999996
keeping track of what he's doing and he

327.069 --> 334.24
has this funny moments definitely oh

330.689 --> 338.379
yeah Owen Benjamin was very good

334.24 --> 342.27
yesterday I don't even remember

338.379 --> 342.27000000000004
everything he talked about it was a lot

348.18 --> 354.24
all right sir I think that was about it

356.039 --> 359.039
yeah

360.52 --> 371.18
Monday was an empty day on my

364.4 --> 377.59999999999997
notification list at least I been

371.18 --> 383.63
watching Outlander very interesting very

377.6 --> 386.06
in seriously there's so much detail of

383.63 --> 387.95
how things work and the clans and

386.06 --> 392.06
everything it's quite fascinating and

387.95 --> 395.06
inspiring to me and really makes me want

392.06 --> 397.4
to work out the details of my D&D world

395.06 --> 399.92
a lot more and I am doing that at least

397.4 --> 402.91999999999996
in my mind it's funny like the old world

399.92 --> 411.94
I had a just a rough general like kind

402.92 --> 411.94
of like an oversimplified Europe with

414.97 --> 421.28000000000003
yeah with kind of a layout that is very

418.73 --> 425.54
convenient so it's almost like Game of

421.28 --> 428.51
Thrones where yeah the map is very

425.54 --> 431.69
obviously everything is placed very

428.51 --> 436.03999999999996
conveniently with tact it's highly

431.69 --> 438.05
concentrated rich story design that's

436.04 --> 439.22
how they build it to be able to get

438.05 --> 442.33
anything out of it

439.22 --> 445.1
that's how the world there is shaped and

442.33 --> 447.02
that's really interesting and I'm

445.1 --> 449.57000000000005
basically trying to do the same thing in

447.02 --> 451.49
my own way and I already had a the

449.57 --> 454.88
fascinating I pretty much drew the map

451.49 --> 459.73
were very early on and just had like

454.88 --> 459.73
okay it's gonna show you

470.69 --> 482.129
so it's it's basically one continent all

476.28 --> 484.13899999999995
right yep not very visible letters and

482.129 --> 486.629
everything but it's basically continent

484.139 --> 491.33
with a giant mountain in between and all

486.629 --> 494.03900000000004
kind from a desert to swamp each region

491.33 --> 506.87899999999996
it's pretty much hellish everywhere here

494.039 --> 511.83
is really a rich agriculture and yeah

506.879 --> 513.8100000000001
it's I don't know it's kind of off scale

511.83 --> 518.519
in the sense that it's for it's probably

513.81 --> 520.649
a lot bigger than it just seems but I've

518.519 --> 523.11
always had problem with the scale of

520.649 --> 525.5
landscape like seriously to

523.11 --> 528.149
conceptualize how big things really are

525.5 --> 531.72
we get a feel for it has been very

528.149 --> 534.93
difficult for me always in that sense I

531.72 --> 537.8100000000001
really like everything that's been

534.93 --> 540.42
happening in the Flat Earth scene with

537.81 --> 542.3699999999999
people photographing things and talking

540.42 --> 545.01
about distances and then seeing it

542.37 --> 547.38
because you know what being going

545.01 --> 552.63
through that in the last at least two

547.38 --> 556.86
years has just helped me focus to get

552.63 --> 559.38
the scale of things more correctly and

556.86 --> 564.42
more understand how deep the depths of

559.38 --> 567.74
that very small space actually is and

564.42 --> 571.04
what should be their landscape lies and

567.74 --> 574.47
thus also I see kind of like how I

571.04 --> 579.42
oversimplified things at first because I

574.47 --> 580.9200000000001
tend to make things much smaller so even

579.42 --> 585.39
though this is supposed to be a giant

580.92 --> 587.88
continent as I designed it as I was just

585.39 --> 590.9399999999999
drawing it out first which is purely

587.88 --> 593.3
improvised it's almost like a small

590.94 --> 593.3000000000001
island

595.369 --> 602.9100000000001
or mario kart race track or something

598.379 --> 607.8290000000001
you know it could be that but right so i

602.91 --> 609.569
need to it's a skill in world designing

607.829 --> 612.209
and i need to get a better feel for the

609.569 --> 618.029
skill of landscape and how big things

612.209 --> 620.9989999999999
really are and i am improving somewhat

618.029 --> 623.819
so that's how i refine this original

620.999 --> 627.929
concept basically improved the

623.819 --> 629.9699999999999
resolution of it and every city starts

627.929 --> 634.949
to really get its own history its own

629.97 --> 638.1890000000001
nobility their agendas pacts typical

634.949 --> 640.16
religions which is very diverse in D&D

638.189 --> 644.069
seriously

640.16 --> 648.149
it's quite complex to even get a good

644.069 --> 655.709
feel for that it's a it well in that

648.149 --> 660.6
sense it is like a diverse reach of from

655.709 --> 665.149
pagan to more christian all kinds of

660.6 --> 669.799
directions but in in a clearly defined

665.149 --> 675.689
pantheon as in gods that are literally

669.799 --> 678.0889999999999
entities it's it's very mythological at

675.689 --> 680.129
that but and it's very fascinating to

678.089 --> 685.1690000000001
work with and a lot of D&D stories have

680.129 --> 687.59
worked with it and i do too right so

685.169 --> 691.159
anyway

687.59 --> 691.159
[Music]

694.28 --> 698.47
all right let's see what I made loose

700.75 --> 708.56
snakes it was funny to see that there

706.4 --> 713.62
was a snake I can in there and there's a

708.56 --> 713.6199999999999
mouse in there as well Loran t

729.38 --> 732.62
[Music]

739.139 --> 749.319
Daniel field John Watson goodie clean I

745.66 --> 752.74
don't know maybe I already told you name

749.319 --> 757.8
something anyway right

752.74 --> 767.05
ah grantee flatter Thanks Thanks

757.8 --> 771.6289999999999
you want more slick rants that's how

767.05 --> 771.6289999999999
many ways can you describe a simpleton

773.279 --> 789.61
it's all seems so superfluous I'm just

777.91 --> 792.49
really tired of the guy it's I don't

789.61 --> 794.589
know attacking him almost starts to make

792.49 --> 798.519
me feel ashamed like I'm attacking a

794.589 --> 800.5
[ __ ] serious you know it but it's just

798.519 --> 803.8
so annoying because he keeps on being

800.5 --> 806.8
such a hypocrite constantly it's and he

803.8 --> 810.25
is just declaring enemies everywhere

806.8 --> 813.4799999999999
it's ridiculous the guy is totally

810.25 --> 813.48
spiraling out of control

815.42 --> 833.6999999999999
[Music]

817.48 --> 836.77
I don't know but yeah to be fair is

833.7 --> 838.9000000000001
however you're gonna interpret it like

836.77 --> 841.39
him constantly being there it is a

838.9 --> 844.63
serious D motivation for me to even go

841.39 --> 846.43
there because it's just especially if I

844.63 --> 848.98
start to bring something up something I

846.43 --> 852.01
typically do like break-in somewhere in

848.98 --> 856.4200000000001
you probably a presupposition a way of

852.01 --> 858.16
thinking and then light up a detail just

856.42 --> 860.0799999999999
to get you thinking of how everything

858.16 --> 862.66
really works and its structured

860.08 --> 865.2700000000001
where it's coming from and slick

862.66 --> 867.67
immediately typically with when I do

865.27 --> 870.03
that he just breaks in and starts to

867.67 --> 874.12
declare that it's all [ __ ] and

870.03 --> 876.79
that's that's worse than when rumpus

874.12 --> 879.76
does that kind of [ __ ] and he rumpus

876.79 --> 882.4
doesn't do that when I light out

879.76 --> 884.61
something unless I'm criticizing rumpus

882.4 --> 887.29
about something then he will always

884.61 --> 889.66
immediately interrupt anything whatever

887.29 --> 892.7199999999999
you're saying but if I'm talking about

889.66 --> 894.73
something else then he wouldn't he

892.72 --> 897.97
rumpus actually has kind of respect for

894.73 --> 903.58
that but Slick James does not have

897.97 --> 905.77
respect for any reasoning at all just

903.58 --> 908.83
once the freaking experience and at any

905.77 --> 911.76
time you go into some kind of structure

908.83 --> 916.09
eyes thinking and he doesn't like it

911.76 --> 920.2
he's gonna call it beliefs for a default

916.09 --> 924.22
and look with a lot of yeah a lot of

920.2 --> 926.26
stuff it is kind of beliefs but that

924.22 --> 929.6800000000001
doesn't mean that it's not useful to

926.26 --> 933.43
figure it out and to see where it's

929.68 --> 936.66
coming from to basically get into yeah

933.43 --> 940.2099999999999
the opponent's thinking in order to

936.66 --> 942.73
approach them more from a friend than as

940.21 --> 945.6500000000001
an enemy in order to make them truly

942.73 --> 948.98
realize things

945.65 --> 952.97
it's like yeah the slick would call that

948.98 --> 956.41
being a snake it's ridiculous guy has no

952.97 --> 961.4300000000001
purpose it's just hanging around

956.41 --> 964.04
shouting at people and being getting

961.43 --> 966.05
very angry if somebody persistently

964.04 --> 968.15
tries to ask him some kind of question

966.05 --> 970.52
whatever it is about even if it's

968.15 --> 974.48
literally about nothing if he's riled up

970.52 --> 980.6899999999999
he won't answer anything anything it's

974.48 --> 1005.98
ridiculous so yeah again how many words

980.69 --> 1008.529
can describe a simpleton slick likes

1005.98 --> 1010.48
Nathan because Nathan is literally like

1008.529 --> 1014.83
some kind of Lord covering for him

1010.48 --> 1018.49
basically saying no he's okay I'm not

1014.83 --> 1021.1600000000001
gonna be really hard handed with him and

1018.49 --> 1025.54
basically manipulate him out in the open

1021.16 --> 1031.48
and Slick's like oh he's working with my

1025.54 --> 1034.3899999999999
rules I like him now he allows me to

1031.48 --> 1037.24
talk his book my [ __ ] even get angry

1034.39 --> 1041.2900000000002
and interrupt lines of thought because

1037.24 --> 1043.9
Nathan apparently doesn't care and yeah

1041.29 --> 1047.3799999999999
that's going on and it's Nathan's issue

1043.9 --> 1049.15
you know if he wants to create chaos for

1047.38 --> 1051.7800000000002
the yeah for amusement value or

1049.15 --> 1059.38
something that's his prerogative but

1051.78 --> 1062.41
yeah if I don't feel I have a proper

1059.38 --> 1067.0590000000002
place there anymore where can ya show my

1062.41 --> 1068.77
qualities then I'm just gonna go less

1067.059 --> 1069.28
through the debates if that's what he

1068.77 --> 1073.44
wants

1069.28 --> 1073.44
wants to get rid of me that's fine

1074.69 --> 1084.15
you know I got shut up our win a lots of

1080.61 --> 1086.1299999999999
running joke is very funny and I find a

1084.15 --> 1087.51
kind of funny too because sometimes I

1086.13 --> 1089.49
literally ask for it

1087.51 --> 1093.26
I kind of know he would say that and

1089.49 --> 1095.31
then I think I mean it silly mood and I

1093.26 --> 1097.3799999999999
think it's funny when he does it

1095.31 --> 1100.6499999999999
sometimes but he never does that the

1097.38 --> 1102.5100000000002
slick ever and I know exactly why

1100.65 --> 1105.0600000000002
because if you tell us like to shut up

1102.51 --> 1109.07
you immediately get all seriously pissed

1105.06 --> 1109.07
off because the guy has no self-control

1111.11 --> 1118.1299999999999
feels like a young teenager stuck in an

1114.0 --> 1118.13
adult body it's ridiculous

1152.74 --> 1168.08
not not really notice as slick is not a

1163.46 --> 1173.8700000000001
sibling of mine and I'm very well aware

1168.08 --> 1180.4399999999998
of Nathan's Nathan shows format what

1173.87 --> 1185.03
he's doing is using an arena so I know

1180.44 --> 1188.66
what he's doing I think it's no match

1185.03 --> 1190.7
for me for anyone that's not the problem

1188.66 --> 1193.88
the problem is is that he takes up so

1190.7 --> 1198.8600000000001
much time and basically red herrings the

1193.88 --> 1201.5300000000002
entire situation he's interrupted so hey

1198.86 --> 1204.11
eventually there will come less new

1201.53 --> 1212.71
ideas out of the debates because of this

1204.11 --> 1212.7099999999998
I guarantee it and it will be noticeable

1213.04 --> 1218.69
so if that's what Nathan wants or look

1216.92 --> 1220.52
you know maybe Nathan is pretty brutal

1218.69 --> 1222.71
about it at some point he's just gonna

1220.52 --> 1225.08
say like okay slick we've been

1222.71 --> 1228.44
entertaining you for a month or two or

1225.08 --> 1230.27
whatever and I'm kind of sick of this

1228.44 --> 1233.8400000000001
[ __ ] you've literally brought nothing

1230.27 --> 1236.62
new to the table just repeating the same

1233.84 --> 1239.3899999999999
[ __ ] over and over again even your

1236.62 --> 1241.28
observations basically are the same over

1239.39 --> 1245.3300000000002
and over again it's kind of becoming the

1241.28 --> 1248.54
standard and everybody's heard it so

1245.33 --> 1250.37
many times we don't care and we don't

1248.54 --> 1255.58
care that you don't care that we don't

1250.37 --> 1255.58
care so

1264.84 --> 1270.259
[Music]

1266.98 --> 1271.3600000000001
and yeah I don't know maybe he'll kick

1270.259 --> 1277.549
him out

1271.36 --> 1279.5
maybe he'll unleash sniper trolls or I

1277.549 --> 1282.789
didn't I don't know how Nathan does that

1279.5 --> 1287.559
he probably knows a lot of people

1282.789 --> 1293.0
through discord or [ __ ] or I don't know

1287.559 --> 1297.4089999999999
not saying that he would literally be

1293.0 --> 1299.69
such a troll on that level but he

1297.409 --> 1301.8500000000001
probably does just know a lot of people

1299.69 --> 1305.289
and could trigger them or maneuver them

1301.85 --> 1310.82
to do certain things and he'd probably

1305.289 --> 1315.47
not shy away from abusing such power if

1310.82 --> 1317.84
he seemed if he thought it was yeah fit

1315.47 --> 1326.419
to do such a thing at such a time so

1317.84 --> 1328.279
we'll see you know and who knows maybe

1326.419 --> 1331.6390000000001
he'll do it to me maybe he just thinks

1328.279 --> 1334.639
I'm too much for liability I question

1331.639 --> 1335.629
too many things I'm too much against

1334.639 --> 1339.62
quantum eraser

1335.629 --> 1342.4089999999999
some people may suggest and if that is

1339.62 --> 1344.84
indeed what is really going on in the

1342.409 --> 1348.1100000000001
end then that's fine and then I've had

1344.84 --> 1352.509
my time on the debates and screw that

1348.11 --> 1352.5089999999998
I'll find my own way I have my own show

1361.69 --> 1367.24
but yeah I'm pretty sure it's gonna end

1364.57 --> 1370.29
up either our win or Slick James is

1367.24 --> 1370.29
gonna leave the debates

1380.71 --> 1385.909
I'm not saying I'm forcing a choice or

1384.14 --> 1388.419
anything I'm just saying if it's pretty

1385.909 --> 1388.419
much inevitable

1461.049 --> 1473.859
right okay getting very distracted by

1465.529 --> 1473.859
chat hmm and I am enjoying my cousin

1501.92 --> 1504.6100000000001
and

1510.99 --> 1521.17
right thanks for that Hanna Dean I kind

1519.1 --> 1525.6399999999999
of bit my tongue on that yesterday but

1521.17 --> 1527.88
yeah if I'm gonna quote somebody in chat

1525.64 --> 1534.19
I might just as well do it right now

1527.88 --> 1535.8700000000001
slick acts like you yeah those were kind

1534.19 --> 1544.29
of the elements I was describing

1535.87 --> 1547.7199999999998
yesterday if you'd paid attention and

1544.29 --> 1551.53
with the Jew I don't mean the specific

1547.72 --> 1554.97
yeah you know it's the over

1551.53 --> 1554.97
generalization of course

1564.91 --> 1571.89
ahem

1567.07 --> 1571.8899999999999
[Music]

1572.65 --> 1580.5400000000002
how do you split that apart that

1574.9 --> 1585.0700000000002
understanding of what people mean when

1580.54 --> 1587.74
they say that because there is it's it's

1585.07 --> 1590.9199999999998
seriously a problem and probably problem

1587.74 --> 1594.64
that some of them of the darker ones

1590.92 --> 1598.3000000000002
really design on purpose because they

1594.64 --> 1602.5
want to be blamed for [ __ ] they want to

1598.3 --> 1610.87
be smeared and then you have the really

1602.5 --> 1615.1
good people could use very very logos

1610.87 --> 1617.11
yeah there are kind of Christians or

1615.1 --> 1619.1499999999999
they are Christians it's it's difficult

1617.11 --> 1622.54
it's a matter of perspective really but

1619.15 --> 1626.6200000000001
that act the right way of proper morals

1622.54 --> 1633.1789999999999
moral standards are not two-faced or

1626.62 --> 1636.6399999999999
honest hard workers all that and yeah

1633.179 --> 1640.42
everybody yeah nobody's blaming them for

1636.64 --> 1643.21
being like Jews it's kind of it's weird

1640.42 --> 1650.14
because they definitely don't they're

1643.21 --> 1653.3500000000001
exactly the opposite so Jews is kind of

1650.14 --> 1657.6100000000001
a colloquial term again it's very weird

1653.35 --> 1660.49
and I think that they that did the dark

1657.61 --> 1663.27
are Jews made it like that

1660.49 --> 1663.27
on purpose

1666.63 --> 1679.0590000000002
it's part of their social tactics I

1670.42 --> 1685.42
guess they thrive under under being

1679.059 --> 1689.08
targeted they use it strategically it's

1685.42 --> 1692.8600000000001
weird but again yeah it's only a

1689.08 --> 1697.559
specific yeah within the larger

1692.86 --> 1697.559
community it is specific group of people

1697.98 --> 1707.22
it's not even like a separate a separate

1704.05 --> 1712.69
tribe or anything it's just individuals

1707.22 --> 1718.15
that kind of conspire together to do

1712.69 --> 1721.14
quite the opposite as the as a good you

1718.15 --> 1724.45
would that would follow the creator and

1721.14 --> 1726.94
be a good person they're conspiring to

1724.45 --> 1730.059
do quite the opposite and they're among

1726.94 --> 1732.52
them and not just among the Jews by the

1730.059 --> 1739.95
ways there's also and of course non Jews

1732.52 --> 1744.6399999999999
that but it is there and that has become

1739.95 --> 1747.309
these type of people are what when

1744.64 --> 1749.0500000000002
people talk about Jews that specifically

1747.309 --> 1752.1399999999999
who they're talking about and it is

1749.05 --> 1756.1299999999999
quite confusing and I say it was

1752.14 --> 1759.88
originally culturally maneuvered to be

1756.13 --> 1762.8500000000001
like this on purpose to make people stop

1759.88 --> 1765.75
talking about it to give those specific

1762.85 --> 1771.309
darker people that do all these and

1765.75 --> 1773.17
sneaky things to give them safe cover so

1771.309 --> 1776.1399999999999
they made it there they're basically

1773.17 --> 1779.67
parasite thing on their own culture and

1776.14 --> 1779.67
their own group

1785.87 --> 1796.6789999999999
so yeah very complicated and in a way I

1791.929 --> 1801.39
appreciated that Owen Benjamin talks

1796.679 --> 1806.429
about it a lot and that he makes fun of

1801.39 --> 1809.88
it and also kind of on purpose doesn't

1806.429 --> 1811.89
explain the details always like you can

1809.88 --> 1814.169
explain all the details every single

1811.89 --> 1817.14
time you make a joke about it but he

1814.169 --> 1819.3600000000001
does explain it usually and very

1817.14 --> 1823.3500000000001
eloquently so and I totally agree with

1819.36 --> 1825.6899999999998
these things and it's fascinating and I

1823.35 --> 1828.0
kind of want to do something similar but

1825.69 --> 1835.1100000000001
not poke so hard just rather make it

1828.0 --> 1836.19
discussable and clarify things as much

1835.11 --> 1839.76
as I can

1836.19 --> 1842.94
not yea and compared to Owen Benjamin I

1839.76 --> 1849.29
probably know or have known very few

1842.94 --> 1849.29
Jews but I did know if you yes

1853.58 --> 1861.36
and I experienced them as to be very

1858.09 --> 1865.9199999999998
different in their social behavior

1861.36 --> 1869.9699999999998
compared to well the rest of people that

1865.92 --> 1877.559
I got to know that was very it was like

1869.97 --> 1879.78
a different system it's but it was

1877.559 --> 1885.2
interesting and they had a lot of energy

1879.78 --> 1885.2
a lot of Drive that was very inspiring

1890.7 --> 1894.779
[Music]

1907.83 --> 1919.5
oh god no no I've it's kind of funny

1915.3 --> 1923.1499999999999
that you say that hm because I did one

1919.5 --> 1926.66
time consider lending money but

1923.15 --> 1930.0900000000001
borrowing money from one of these guys

1926.66 --> 1931.23
actually a friend but he kind of warned

1930.09 --> 1935.76
me against it

1931.23 --> 1937.8
it was weird so like okay I guess I'll

1935.76 --> 1940.23
not do that unless I have no other

1937.8 --> 1953.31
option or something but he literally

1940.23 --> 1959.34
warned me not to do that was weird but

1953.31 --> 1962.34
yeah bankers I I think that the Jews

1959.34 --> 1970.29
that I got to know I think they all went

1962.34 --> 1974.4599999999998
into banker business all of them yeah I

1970.29 --> 1979.3799999999999
think I'm pretty sure about that or or

1974.46 --> 1981.69
in trade and they were already doing

1979.38 --> 1985.95
that like as teenagers they were already

1981.69 --> 1988.7
into that they're so far ahead just I

1985.95 --> 1991.56
was still fooling around and just

1988.7 --> 1994.68
observing experiencing things trying to

1991.56 --> 1996.6299999999999
make sense of well puzzling things

1994.68 --> 2001.6100000000001
together trying to get a worldview that

1996.63 --> 2003.71
was clear as I'm doing now still but I

2001.61 --> 2007.52
was just focused on that and they were

2003.71 --> 2009.83
already so entangled in there well their

2007.52 --> 2017.0
career future and everything and I

2009.83 --> 2018.1799999999998
wasn't I just had that powerful drive I

2017.0 --> 2021.35
don't know

2018.18 --> 2021.3500000000001
very ambitious

at

2042.86 --> 2046.01
[Music]

2049.65 --> 2057.9300000000003
really boy anything that could be it's

2057.24 --> 2060.8399999999997
weird

2057.93 --> 2064.2599999999998
I may be speaking a little out of turn

2060.84 --> 2067.9100000000003
but if I remember it correctly yeah if

2064.26 --> 2067.9100000000003
they just don't like you

2068.03 --> 2076.6200000000003
they'll do that kind of [ __ ] just to

2073.23 --> 2079.5
bully people basically they'll borrow

2076.62 --> 2083.64
money and act really nice and then just

2079.5 --> 2086.22
act like that never happened I I think I

2083.64 --> 2091.2599999999998
remember having witnessed that happened

2086.22 --> 2097.0499999999997
to somebody else at one time so it could

2091.26 --> 2102.42
be but again that's not for everyone

2097.05 --> 2107.3700000000003
that's I don't think yeah or maybe it is

2102.42 --> 2109.7000000000003
more a what the younger people do I

2107.37 --> 2109.7
think

2115.37 --> 2124.97
anyway this is not yet did now again

2118.94 --> 2129.11
this is these people that I'm talking

2124.97 --> 2134.27
about they were not Christian Jews like

2129.11 --> 2137.1200000000003
we we all yeah this was all through the

2134.27 --> 2143.8
gothic and metal scene basically these

2137.12 --> 2143.7999999999997
people were into that as well so right

2151.11 --> 2160.33
yeah except for the not everyone but

2155.56 --> 2164.59
yeah some weight yeah it's like half of

2160.33 --> 2167.47
them because I did also know Jews before

2164.59 --> 2175.27
that even in school that I learned that

2167.47 --> 2178.0899999999997
they were Jewish yeah I guess throughout

2175.27 --> 2181.54
school I've probably met quite a few

2178.09 --> 2186.9900000000002
Jews and there were really nice people

2181.54 --> 2186.99
and intelligent

2196.81 --> 2198.81
ah

2209.11 --> 2227.75
right anyway good enough about Jews Jews

2212.66 --> 2236.3599999999997
Jews yeah I don't hate him I think

2227.75 --> 2238.82
they're very interesting I just like

2236.36 --> 2240.9500000000003
Owen says don't like how they basically

2238.82 --> 2243.3500000000004
try to manipulate things in the

2240.95 --> 2247.04
degrading way over over time and I'm

2243.35 --> 2251.15
talking about the really dark ones on

2247.04 --> 2254.75
top that's really annoying that they do

2251.15 --> 2257.84
that that they don't seem to have a near

2254.75 --> 2260.36
compulsion to do that constantly to

2257.84 --> 2271.46
sneak that in it's just maybe how to

2260.36 --> 2273.56
control hobby they have or something now

2271.46 --> 2276.94
it's it's methodology it's all

2273.56 --> 2280.39
methodology it's like a phoenician thing

2276.94 --> 2286.9700000000003
they probably know it and it's just kept

2280.39 --> 2292.42
hidden in general but again not all Jews

2286.97 --> 2292.4199999999996
it's a group a group within the group

2295.09 --> 2303.05
and it's very unlikely to be a specific

2299.39 --> 2312.97
tribe as well because from what I've

2303.05 --> 2317.48
gathered is that and I don't think that

2312.97 --> 2319.3399999999997
Jews force each other to like they don't

2317.48 --> 2322.34
enslave one they did everything is

2319.34 --> 2325.4300000000003
voluntary based I think pretty much per

2322.34 --> 2330.02
default nobody tries to really force

2325.43 --> 2339.58
another Jew like I've never seen that so

2330.02 --> 2345.34
it's all voluntary based it's I think I

2339.58 --> 2345.34
haven't like literally confirmed that

2353.67 --> 2362.099
or it could have been maybe just kind of

2357.869 --> 2365.369
a code among a group of younger people

2362.099 --> 2369.2400000000002
look from what I've understood that is

2365.369 --> 2371.67
that even like Jewish communities have

2369.24 --> 2375.779
youngsters come together and do stuff

2371.67 --> 2380.39
and it seems very likely that they could

2375.779 --> 2383.01
then conspire with a bond and a code

2380.39 --> 2384.9
themselves and that I just because all

2383.01 --> 2387.3190000000004
these specific Jews that I mentioned

2384.9 --> 2390.079
they did all know each other absolutely

2387.319 --> 2393.39
they all definitely knew one another

2390.079 --> 2399.98
without an exception there were no

2393.39 --> 2403.019
separate Jew groups in my experience so

2399.98 --> 2409.859
they may have just had it like a youth

2403.019 --> 2413.0989999999997
code that they took the old codes very

2409.859 --> 2416.519
seriously that it's like a youngster

2413.099 --> 2418.5
conspiracy among one another and not an

2416.519 --> 2423.9599999999996
official way of doing that

2418.5 --> 2427.16
I haven't witnessed many interactions

2423.96 --> 2431.4900000000002
with their parents by the way at that

2427.16 --> 2435.8289999999997
so anyway interesting I think it's

2431.49 --> 2435.8289999999997
interesting I think cues are fascinating

2439.549 --> 2446.18
Nathan oh please did you write of course

2443.789 --> 2446.1800000000003
he is

2446.569 --> 2450.109
that is hilarious

2460.22 --> 2462.97
what

2474.26 --> 2482.0
Wow alibied to say it is not a religion

2477.29 --> 2488.0299999999997
it's not entirely correct it's a culture

2482.0 --> 2489.71
group really that go hand in hand with

2488.03 --> 2494.5400000000004
the religion but there are several

2489.71 --> 2497.81
angles to that religion and it's very

2494.54 --> 2500.72
complex of that so it's not just the

2497.81 --> 2503.35
religion it is the culture that's

2500.72 --> 2509.0499999999997
directly intertwined with that religion

2503.35 --> 2513.68
but there are atheist Jews as well and

2509.05 --> 2520.73
Satanic Jews and know kinds of Christian

2513.68 --> 2526.21
Jews like really Orthodox Jews yeah you

2520.73 --> 2530.44
know it's Arabs

2526.21 --> 2531.619
now that's semis that when they say

2530.44 --> 2537.59
Semites

2531.619 --> 2539.75
that's the from the Arab regions that's

2537.59 --> 2542.03
that's the it's kind of weird about it

2539.75 --> 2544.84
because everybody thinks when you say

2542.03 --> 2550.4300000000003
Semites that it's Jews but it's actually

2544.84 --> 2554.03
designated to a specific racial group

2550.43 --> 2560.27
that is present in the Arab regions it's

2554.03 --> 2564.65
so silly and the the most of the Jews

2560.27 --> 2569.21
that we know are definitely not tied

2564.65 --> 2573.26
into those race bloodlines although

2569.21 --> 2576.17
there are probably some still left that

2573.26 --> 2578.75
are still Jewish that our actual Semites

2576.17 --> 2583.4900000000002
actual Jewish Semites but it's probably

2578.75 --> 2586.76
not so much in the open because they're

2583.49 --> 2589.2099999999996
not much appreciated that as everyone

2586.76 --> 2589.21
well knows

2589.67 --> 2596.949
[Music]

2602.86 --> 2609.27
oh I seem to have brought out a lot of

2607.03 --> 2609.27
friction

2611.46 --> 2615.75
yep I get it

2619.7 --> 2627.43
it's a difficult subject I used to be

2622.87 --> 2632.33
and this comes even from my grandmother

2627.43 --> 2636.1699999999996
and my own family were giants Jew

2632.33 --> 2636.56
defenders basically as liberals was part

2636.17 --> 2642.9500000000003
of it

2636.56 --> 2649.0
and well safe to say that my Jewish

2642.95 --> 2649.0
friends really appreciated that so yeah

2649.09 --> 2656.33
but I really didn't know I just had the

2652.34 --> 2658.58
superficial ideas about it then I had no

2656.33 --> 2664.33
idea what was really going on and their

2658.58 --> 2664.33
secrets and and I got to know some of it

2665.53 --> 2672.23
looking into the religion and the

2669.11 --> 2674.53
cultural habits and things and some

2672.23 --> 2679.04
ethereal things that philosophically

2674.53 --> 2681.92
philosophical discussions with I was it

2679.04 --> 2691.57
with rabbis um in my family was very

2681.92 --> 2696.46
interesting and I I found many of

2691.57 --> 2700.94
philosophical thingies details very wise

2696.46 --> 2704.27
so I had a great intellectual respect

2700.94 --> 2706.9700000000003
because of that this was still kind of

2704.27 --> 2709.93
young I was like 12 I didn't really know

2706.97 --> 2715.45
too after that and I got to know Jews

2709.93 --> 2715.45
through school but yeah

2721.73 --> 2731.18
it's really through some of the darker

2724.86 --> 2733.59
things that I experienced just are I

2731.18 --> 2735.21
just saw it as like a cultural

2733.59 --> 2740.55
difference first like they have their

2735.21 --> 2744.54
habits that are very contrasting to how

2740.55 --> 2748.86
I would do things but if you get if you

2744.54 --> 2751.11
understand the code they use they're

2748.86 --> 2756.6600000000003
just social like that's how I experience

2751.11 --> 2763.26
then you're just fine and yeah you can

2756.66 --> 2765.3599999999997
even be almost friends they're not easy

2763.26 --> 2769.5600000000004
to declare friendship like that by the

2765.36 --> 2773.79
way the ones that I've experienced the

2769.56 --> 2777.36
acquaintances or whatever and I didn't

2773.79 --> 2781.35
see it at first but yeah I've learned

2777.36 --> 2784.71
more since then and I they they acted

2781.35 --> 2788.39
out like really badly sometimes where

2784.71 --> 2792.15
they basically frightened me this is

2788.39 --> 2794.79
after yeah I've already gotten to know

2792.15 --> 2800.1
them much better over time and they

2794.79 --> 2801.75
showed some very grim attitudes towards

2800.1 --> 2806.19
certain things that I just didn't get

2801.75 --> 2809.55
just like why are you so so dark about

2806.19 --> 2813.57
this was weird but maybe that's just

2809.55 --> 2818.67
personal issues it was teenage times so

2813.57 --> 2820.2000000000003
it's it's very hard to really get a good

2818.67 --> 2824.2400000000002
grip through my own experiences but

2820.2 --> 2824.24
these that I did experience all this

2830.28 --> 2833.0
yeah

2834.66 --> 2841.7
it's not the same anymore of course I

2837.18 --> 2845.999
definitely realize now that okay Jews is

2841.7 --> 2848.5789999999997
it's not how the mainstream pretty much

2845.999 --> 2853.4399999999996
portrays it you gotta be careful with it

2848.579 --> 2858.9
and you it's like you're really forced

2853.44 --> 2861.779
to learn things about their social

2858.9 --> 2863.339
culture in order to properly be able to

2861.779 --> 2867.569
deal with them you really need to do

2863.339 --> 2870.869
that that is it pretty much that's my my

2867.569 --> 2874.729
general advice now from a very modest

2870.869 --> 2874.7290000000003
still liberal perspective

2883.28 --> 2887.02
all right so anyway

2898.17 --> 2912.099
no let's not repeat history and show no

2903.849 --> 2918.4
Sun Doherty let's not do that local all

2912.099 --> 2922.21
that technically needs to happen is like

2918.4 --> 2925.51
our one Benjamin says don't fall for

2922.21 --> 2928.869
their [ __ ] and don't give them too

2925.51 --> 2939.13
much control set very strict ground

2928.869 --> 2943.059
rules clear clarity and then Jews are

2939.13 --> 2948.369
great because they're very resourceful

2943.059 --> 2953.44
and talented functional people if they

2948.369 --> 2957.3900000000003
want to be but they're sneaky

2953.44 --> 2957.39
you can't just Oh

2957.839 --> 2964.89
if they're really powerful you gotta be

2960.609 --> 2964.89
careful that is it

2970.01 --> 2979.5400000000004
maybe we need a goji a go Jim Joo

2973.579 --> 2979.54
instruction manual that's a joke

2988.77 --> 2996.48
right yeah Jonathan Doherty look Joe

2994.05 --> 2998.73
population is absolutely not a problem

2996.48 --> 3001.4
especially in the United States where

2998.73 --> 3005.03
race literally does not matter what

3001.4 --> 3007.79
matters really is your loyalty to the

3005.03 --> 3009.619
nation and there's a big problem and you

3007.79 --> 3013.16
basically explained it wrong because

3009.619 --> 3014.9
then being Jew as nothing is not the

3013.16 --> 3018.29
issue what the problem is is that there

3014.9 --> 3023.29
are dual citizenship with Israel double

3018.29 --> 3024.67
nationality and that I think is not

3023.29 --> 3031.7
constitutional

3024.67 --> 3035.65
it's very stray weird that that's just

3031.7 --> 3041.27
being done in plain sight it's very odd

3035.65 --> 3045.25
unless unless there were direct nation

3041.27 --> 3047.69
merger plans but nothing said about that

3045.25 --> 3049.88
because then wouldn't matter

3047.69 --> 3052.07
differentially become one nation or

3049.88 --> 3053.84
something you know then it makes sense

3052.07 --> 3056.42
but there's no there's nothing being

3053.84 --> 3060.1600000000003
said about that so it's just yeah double

3056.42 --> 3060.16
nationality in a government and that's

3062.32 --> 3073.13
that's obviously a compromised

3066.23 --> 3075.65
government so yeah that is a problem

3073.13 --> 3078.76
definitely but doesn't really matter if

3075.65 --> 3082.9100000000003
they're Jews or not it's all about the

3078.76 --> 3086.2700000000004
national the nationality that's the

3082.91 --> 3089.21
problem Israel is very problematic in

3086.27 --> 3093.71
many ways politically as well but that's

3089.21 --> 3095.69
Israel it's not Jews in general even

3093.71 --> 3099.7400000000002
though yeah a lot of Jews are pretty

3095.69 --> 3101.48
much on the Israel bandwagon but

3099.74 --> 3103.1299999999997
definitely not all of them but it's a

3101.48 --> 3105.85
separate issue it's a political issue a

3103.13 --> 3109.869
geopolitical issue it's again something

3105.85 --> 3109.8689999999997
slightly different again

3110.97 --> 3125.2099999999996
oh that's that's deserves a timeout

3121.47 --> 3125.2099999999996
that's so that's so dumb

3125.599 --> 3143.31
karate weaves gravity wave been proven

3135.92 --> 3149.4900000000002
right so wave again is an effect through

3143.31 --> 3154.92
a medium so that doesn't make any damn

3149.49 --> 3157.49
sense how can you ah it just doesn't

3154.92 --> 3157.4900000000002
make any damn sense

3183.96 --> 3190.11
if you're saying that gravity is a wave

3187.34 --> 3194.4
then you're basically comparing it to

3190.11 --> 3200.01
the functionality of sound and that's

3194.4 --> 3202.7000000000003
definitely not how gravity is supposed

3200.01 --> 3208.5800000000004
to be functioning it's more like a field

3202.7 --> 3208.58
not a wave theoretically according to

3209.57 --> 3226.98
the conception of gravity yeah exactly

3224.73 --> 3230.67
and flat enough gravity is a wave of

3226.98 --> 3239.0
what's exactly that's thank you that's

3230.67 --> 3242.61
that says it much more concisely hey

3239.0 --> 3246.02
I've got a guest that's funny I kind of

3242.61 --> 3249.63
wanted to round out the show but hmm

3246.02 --> 3257.19
hello does studios hey I want how are

3249.63 --> 3259.8900000000003
you dude 68 hello what's up yeah sorry

3257.19 --> 3265.4
sorry to join a bit light and if you got

3259.89 --> 3267.7799999999997
a rep up yeah we can do another tone um

3265.4 --> 3272.73
could you give a hint as to what you

3267.78 --> 3273.3500000000004
wouldn't want it to bring up nothing in

3272.73 --> 3276.27
particular

3273.35 --> 3278.1
no I just want to join whatever you want

3276.27 --> 3283.82
to talk about whatever discussion river

3278.1 --> 3283.8199999999997
you talking about you know okay hmm

3284.0 --> 3290.49
so hey you been anyway yeah I'm doing

3290.19 --> 3295.07
all right

3290.49 --> 3298.2299999999996
that was a bit grumpy starting up

3295.07 --> 3302.8500000000004
because of my hangout in the Hangout on

3298.23 --> 3306.33
Jose's like I was trying to listen back

3302.85 --> 3308.37
and I literally could barely make out a

3306.33 --> 3310.29
word I was saying it was because I

3308.37 --> 3311.85
remembered what I was talking about that

3310.29 --> 3312.569
I could follow what I was talking about

3311.85 --> 3315.089
but

3312.569 --> 3319.229
Rumph is literally interrupted every

3315.089 --> 3322.14
single sentence I made rumpus here yeah

3319.229 --> 3325.799
it's well this biscuits and I was you

3322.14 --> 3328.469
know we're trying to keep civil hmm you

3325.799 --> 3330.66
know I I wasn't like shut up rumpus I

3328.469 --> 3333.39
was I was like and he just kept

3330.66 --> 3335.8089999999997
interrupting every single time and I

3333.39 --> 3339.5389999999998
kept calm and he just kept on doing it

3335.809 --> 3344.369
in retrospect and I'm amazed that I

3339.539 --> 3346.0490000000004
could keep that calm he was the guy yeah

3344.369 --> 3348.2690000000002
I mean if you can [ __ ] if you focus on

3346.049 --> 3350.16
it you know right but it wasn't

3348.269 --> 3353.249
effective in the end because you could

3350.16 --> 3356.189
just couldn't hear me hmm I really have

3353.249 --> 3358.979
to make him shut up because his voice

3356.189 --> 3362.489
seemed to just have priority in the in

3358.979 --> 3365.8999999999996
the room every time I interrupted my

3362.489 --> 3365.9
entire voice would just fall away

3366.559 --> 3372.599
Varian yeah he's his voice seems to cut

3369.869 --> 3375.4790000000003
through all the conversation somehow

3372.599 --> 3378.779
it's it's a prioritization system within

3375.479 --> 3381.779
Google and it's very it's unpredictable

3378.779 --> 3383.4
how it works I've had a period where my

3381.779 --> 3386.759
voice suddenly has priority over

3383.4 --> 3390.599
everyone's constantly hmm and now it

3386.759 --> 3392.189
seems to be almost the opposite and I'm

3390.599 --> 3396.9190000000003
noticing it because every time I do

3392.189 --> 3398.779
interrupt anybody nobody shuts up ever

3396.919 --> 3402.419
it's very annoying

3398.779 --> 3403.739
it's annoying it's frustrating yeah you

3402.419 --> 3409.1299999999997
gotta be a very place shut up I'm

3403.739 --> 3409.13
interrupting here you know

3410.53 --> 3417.6400000000003
all right but yeah that happened and

3413.98 --> 3418.59
yeah I was kind of a waste just didn't

3417.64 --> 3424.42
feel good

3418.59 --> 3427.1800000000003
hmm it was was this Jose rumpus

3424.42 --> 3428.23
no it was all filled up with all kinds

3427.18 --> 3431.74
of people

3428.23 --> 3438.82
oh yeah what about sleek was easy hmm

3431.74 --> 3444.9599999999996
a sleek no no no change

3438.82 --> 3446.1400000000003
yeah yeah get something so dr. Murray

3444.96 --> 3448.48
sorry

3446.14 --> 3455.22
he gets on Jose's too sometimes I've

3448.48 --> 3455.22
seen okay when what do you want to ask

3457.05 --> 3463.05
um I forgot was one say okay

3470.16 --> 3475.74
but yeah it's like he's a bit of a trial

3472.51 --> 3479.7700000000004
I think he's just there to waste time

3475.74 --> 3482.3799999999997
unfortunately everyone's you know he

3479.77 --> 3488.89
sort of amended to be into debating the

3482.38 --> 3490.69
meaning of experience versus belief you

3488.89 --> 3492.8199999999997
know seems in the last week or two weeks

3490.69 --> 3494.29
was I mean it's like every day they the

3492.82 --> 3498.1600000000003
show just sort of gets drowned out with

3494.29 --> 3501.93
all these with everyone arguing about

3498.16 --> 3508.39
them what is belief what is experience

3501.93 --> 3509.47
yeah and all this other stuff yeah no I

3508.39 --> 3511.45
was gonna say there's a few people in

3509.47 --> 3515.0499999999997
the chat who are in the comments you

3511.45 --> 3519.93
know who are like yes like theists like

3515.05 --> 3525.4300000000003
that but I don't think yeah yes

3519.93 --> 3527.54
what he's doing is just projecting he's

3525.43 --> 3533.08
just projecting his anger

3527.54 --> 3535.04
I don't think he's expressing himself

3533.08 --> 3537.31
and he doesn't give a [ __ ] about

3535.04 --> 3542.87
anything

3537.31 --> 3545.5099999999998
yeah just like a woman yeah a man who is

3542.87 --> 3551.06
not in control of his emotions he's a

3545.51 --> 3556.3300000000004
woman and he's a woman he's rejecting I

3551.06 --> 3560.75
wouldn't cousin a woman oh I think I

3556.33 --> 3564.1
prefer the word [ __ ] in this case sorry

3560.75 --> 3571.46
well you know women can you I don't

3564.1 --> 3578.7799999999997
regard them yep but yeah just like a

3571.46 --> 3581.3
woman he talks with that and he what's

3578.78 --> 3583.88
the word he just doesn't have any reason

3581.3 --> 3586.25
or accountability to what he says he's

3583.88 --> 3588.76
very emotional like a woman and he's

3586.25 --> 3592.85
just predicting his mother's anger

3588.76 --> 3595.36
because yeah most most black men in

3592.85 --> 3598.91
America were raised by their mothers

3595.36 --> 3601.94
seventy-five percent something like that

3598.91 --> 3603.62
it's very high I hope you're not getting

3601.94 --> 3607.13
to the point where you're gonna tell me

3603.62 --> 3609.7
that he's actually a [ __ ] no no he's

3607.13 --> 3609.7000000000003
not a training

3612.79 --> 3625.88
I mean just generally speaking with

3620.92 --> 3627.2000000000003
people in their culture you know they

3625.88 --> 3630.86
were raised by their mothers their words

3627.2 --> 3634.43
were very angry mothers and you know

3630.86 --> 3638.63
very angry women black women you know

3634.43 --> 3640.22
yes it more hyped up in the 90s so they

3638.63 --> 3642.05
project their anger onto the child

3640.22 --> 3643.3999999999996
because of their because there's because

3642.05 --> 3648.29
they're stuck with raising the children

3643.4 --> 3650.84
without the father and the kids grow up

3648.29 --> 3654.68
projecting their mother's anger onto on

3650.84 --> 3657.29
other people right hmm so he can talk

3654.68 --> 3659.5699999999997
about experience and all this [ __ ]

3657.29 --> 3660.69
as much as he likes but he's just

3659.57 --> 3665.4
projecting he

3660.69 --> 3668.339
is anger from his mother any I know you

3665.4 --> 3673.4700000000003
can't you know you can't say your mama

3668.339 --> 3675.0
to a black guy in America but I don't

3673.47 --> 3680.609
live in their culture I live in a

3675.0 --> 3682.29
different culture you know and I've been

3680.609 --> 3685.56
listening to the show for about a year

3682.29 --> 3690.75
and a half you know and all the guys on

3685.56 --> 3697.47
the show like yourself Ranchi ball or

3690.75 --> 3702.99
Flay chocolate mm-hmm

3697.47 --> 3707.52
whose other guy Kimo you know these are

3702.99 --> 3710.3689999999997
all just even God I was gonna say PJ but

3707.52 --> 3713.19
even some of the wackos you know that

3710.369 --> 3714.7200000000003
come on the show they're not you know

3713.19 --> 3718.02
they're idiots and they call each other

3714.72 --> 3719.6699999999996
idiots and all this sort of thing but

3718.02 --> 3724.369
they know no one never comes on to

3719.67 --> 3728.28
deliberately cause pain to other people

3724.369 --> 3730.9500000000003
you know mm-hmm which is what six don't

3728.28 --> 3734.76
he's just inflicting his pain onto other

3730.95 --> 3737.819
people no nothing else just trying to

3734.76 --> 3741.78
just dominate he's trying to dominate he

3737.819 --> 3745.589
is he literally uses threat of violence

3741.78 --> 3751.2900000000004
and different religious persecution as

3745.589 --> 3758.5789999999997
well he's a total dick I don't know what

3751.29 --> 3760.95
he's really just stances but but this is

3758.579 --> 3764.099
what he's bringing you know I don't he

3760.95 --> 3766.1699999999996
his sleep I he's James his mum going on

3764.099 --> 3767.339
you know I'm betting that's what she

3766.17 --> 3770.67
called him and that's what she called

3767.339 --> 3774.39
his dad he's a snake all men of snakes

3770.67 --> 3777.63
know all these snakes oh yeah it's an

3774.39 --> 3780.2999999999997
interesting differently but yeah let's

3777.63 --> 3782.1600000000003
it's no use really speculating about it

3780.3 --> 3785.94
he's never gonna know it so unless

3782.16 --> 3788.069
somebody's gonna do so much research

3785.94 --> 3791.13
James we're never gonna find out I

3788.069 --> 3792.85
guarantee it yeah well not speak about

3791.13 --> 3794.86
it

3792.85 --> 3797.52
prefer spending five minutes just

3794.86 --> 3801.7000000000003
threatening people that even bring it up

3797.52 --> 3804.37
yeah but this is why he's not a strong

3801.7 --> 3807.1
man he's a weak woman he's an angry

3804.37 --> 3809.89
woman didn't and you know that's what

3807.1 --> 3811.66
people just go realize you know he

3809.89 --> 3815.5299999999997
doesn't speak the truth he speaks [ __ ]

3811.66 --> 3817.1499999999996
he sounds like Oprah and unhooking that

3815.53 --> 3818.4
Oprah wind she's on the stage I'm

3817.15 --> 3825.82
talking about Oprah when she's backstage

3818.4 --> 3826.96
yawn it everyone that's leaked so just

3825.82 --> 3832.3300000000004
think of a little black woman angry

3826.96 --> 3837.64
black meets all going Wow okay thanks

3832.33 --> 3840.0099999999998
it's deep you may be on target but it's

3837.64 --> 3846.46
pretty brutal the declare this gotta

3840.01 --> 3851.17
stuff but oh well well it's I mean the

3846.46 --> 3854.35
Hangout is not like you know some like a

3864.28 --> 3868.6600000000003
bad Leroy Brown you know telling

3866.62 --> 3871.75
everyone you know you don't tell me what

3868.66 --> 3874.5699999999997
I believe and all this corners [ __ ] you

3871.75 --> 3878.68
know doing the big James Butler sound

3874.57 --> 3879.8500000000004
like mr. t yeah it's like mr. t but

3878.68 --> 3883.0
without any balls

3879.85 --> 3886.0299999999997
he said Bohemian nobody's a bohemian

3883.0 --> 3896.29
needless yeah maybe you could call him

3886.03 --> 3900.9700000000003
Bohemia mr. t but I don't get it

3896.29 --> 3903.27
this is not my theory of studies well

3900.97 --> 3906.43
I've watched a guy called

3903.27 --> 3907.54
Reverend Jesse Lee Peterson and I

3906.43 --> 3909.1299999999997
watched his channel for about a year

3907.54 --> 3911.2599999999998
watched a lot of his videos cuz I was

3909.13 --> 3914.8
interested in psychology and counseling

3911.26 --> 3917.92
and here's a he was born in Alabama on

3914.8 --> 3922.09
the on a plantation during the Jim Crow

3917.92 --> 3924.01
law Jim Crow laws and you know he's

3922.09 --> 3925.4700000000003
authors in radio show for years and his

3924.01 --> 3927.75
counselor and

3925.47 --> 3930.66
and he talks a lot about this problem

3927.75 --> 3933.869
with black men in America okay under

3930.66 --> 3935.46
it's in like in the 30s and 40s and the

3933.869 --> 3938.1600000000003
50s

3935.46 --> 3941.4900000000002
black people were getting married having

3938.16 --> 3944.0989999999997
kids working hard right and was until

3941.49 --> 3946.02
the Civil Rights even came along yes and

3944.099 --> 3949.1090000000004
the government decided to give all of

3946.02 --> 3951.5099999999998
the single black mothers some money and

3949.109 --> 3953.91
free stuff if there's no man in the

3951.51 --> 3954.6600000000003
house sound hearing started and they

3953.91 --> 3957.24
ruined it

3954.66 --> 3963.7799999999997
they ruined it and they spoil all so

3957.24 --> 3968.6699999999996
it's been ongoing still that's the

3963.78 --> 3972.15
ruined rap culture and they brought out

3968.67 --> 3977.46
this general even pop level image of

3972.15 --> 3983.76
single black mom always you know eight

3977.46 --> 3985.609
men exactly yeah but but that's pretty

3983.76 --> 3988.9500000000003
much the left-wing

3985.609 --> 3991.619
that's Marxism its Marxism influence and

3988.95 --> 3994.7999999999997
they definitely touch upon black America

3991.619 --> 3999.4500000000003
they've targeted them from from a very

3994.8 --> 4001.6400000000003
early on you could trace it back to the

3999.45 --> 4006.98
the Ku Klux Klan being founded by the

4001.64 --> 4009.77
Democrats exactly exactly and most black

4006.98 --> 4014.78
people it's social engineering its mouth

4009.77 --> 4016.4
museum meddling mmm the blacks

4014.78 --> 4018.7400000000002
predominate voted for the Republicans

4016.4 --> 4022.04
and in the civil rights movement they

4018.74 --> 4025.8489999999997
switched over because the government

4022.04 --> 4027.5299999999997
promised them handouts and assistance if

4025.849 --> 4032.27
they were single the mothers of singles

4027.53 --> 4034.9100000000003
so the men would leave you know it

4032.27 --> 4036.859
wouldn't hang around and so you have

4034.91 --> 4039.6499999999996
this epidemic of men being raised by

4036.859 --> 4041.0
women and instead of having a band

4039.65 --> 4042.7400000000002
saccade them they have woman's of garden

4041.0 --> 4044.96
so they've um woman's anger they think

4042.74 --> 4047.18
like woman act like a woman you know

4044.96 --> 4049.339
they may have a man's body and be six

4047.18 --> 4052.1299999999997
foot ten or whatever and have tattoos

4049.339 --> 4054.349
and you know be all badass and all this

4052.13 --> 4057.58
[ __ ] but that's what it is it's just

4054.349 --> 4057.5800000000004
it's just anger and

4057.809 --> 4070.059
hatred I don't know I I got extreme but

4065.2 --> 4072.0989999999997
ya know I um I can't confirm it so but

4070.059 --> 4074.23
but this is what Jesse Lee this is what

4072.099 --> 4076.27
Jesse Lee talks about you know he knows

4074.23 --> 4082.93
what he's talking about he sort of lives

4076.27 --> 4085.39
through it if you say so that like a lot

4082.93 --> 4089.049
of black people in America have had

4085.39 --> 4092.2889999999998
their heads screwed up and their social

4089.049 --> 4094.15
action act screwed up by how the society

4092.289 --> 4097.299
has engineered them how culture has been

4094.15 --> 4105.279
arranged how social behavior has been

4097.299 --> 4108.449
manipulated and also like people among

4105.279 --> 4112.029
the group themselves abusing it as well

4108.449 --> 4114.549
well basically feeding on their own in

4112.029 --> 4116.319
the process that does happened that

4114.549 --> 4121.06
happens with every group when they're

4116.319 --> 4123.13
targeted by d-wave every group has their

4121.06 --> 4126.609
people that start feeding on their own

4123.13 --> 4130.509
as soon as they become targeted socially

4126.609 --> 4132.96
with manipulation and decay basically

4130.509 --> 4136.39
the depravity

4132.96 --> 4138.58
so yeah the two the two leading causes

4136.39 --> 4143.1990000000005
of death in their attacks just have it

4138.58 --> 4146.5
will be a big target yeah the for social

4143.199 --> 4147.969
engineering yeah the two leading causes

4146.5 --> 4150.31
of death black people America our

4147.969 --> 4157.65
abortion and being shot by other black

4150.31 --> 4159.969
people yeah yeah no it's not good indeed

4157.65 --> 4162.16
someone I remember someone a certain

4159.969 --> 4167.1
video that he said that black people are

4162.16 --> 4170.139999999999
targeted especially african-americans by

4167.1 --> 4172.77
evil forces or evil people or the evil

4170.14 --> 4177.1
government or whatever how's it be

4172.77 --> 4181.509
because no one praises no one worships

4177.1 --> 4182.92
like white people when it comes to their

4181.509 --> 4186.31
Christian likes have expressed

4182.92 --> 4187.839
Christianity yes you know yeah one day

4186.31 --> 4188.9800000000005
stick does very much you have a lot of

4187.839 --> 4193.36
heart

4188.98 --> 4196.8099999999995
pretty much no one Eva no no group has

4193.36 --> 4201.009999999999
really expresses the the faith like they

4196.81 --> 4205.570000000001
do you know it's very unique it's very

4201.01 --> 4208.54
powerful it's very what can you say man

4205.57 --> 4211.69
it's just it's your soul its genetic

4208.54 --> 4214.33
serious they did they have it with their

4211.69 --> 4216.549999999999
own tribal the tribal religious in

4214.33 --> 4219.88
Africa they still never it's the same

4216.55 --> 4223.84
thing it's just these are very energy

4219.88 --> 4227.74
rich passionate people that thrive under

4223.84 --> 4231.43
this kind of thing and it probably also

4227.74 --> 4233.8
use it for self-healing social bonding

4231.43 --> 4239.200000000001
all kinds of functions it is literally a

4233.8 --> 4241.3
function that's bred in genetically or

4239.2 --> 4244.71
designed in I don't know how it got

4241.3 --> 4248.47
there but they have it a lot of them

4244.71 --> 4251.59
yeah like really black African people

4248.47 --> 4253.27
and they thrive this in the form their

4251.59 --> 4258.400000000001
religion once they get it once they

4253.27 --> 4263.860000000001
cross over then they totally yeah they

4258.4 --> 4266.62
become very very good oh they got

4263.86 --> 4268.719999999999
willing they go exactly yeah they go

4266.62 --> 4271.21
once once day the next once they go

4268.72 --> 4273.01
there yeah they'll they'll put so much

4271.21 --> 4274.93
heart in it of the usually but you have

4273.01 --> 4277.93
to get him there that's usually the

4274.93 --> 4280.12
problem teenagers being stubborn ass not

4277.93 --> 4284.31
really wanting to do or dedicate

4280.12 --> 4287.89
anything that you have to find it first

4284.31 --> 4290.31
hmm then your forties home enjoyed

4287.89 --> 4294.79
what's a lot of storytelling with this

4290.31 --> 4296.5
you know what's that sorry I interrupted

4294.79 --> 4299.71
you sorry at that Hollywood has

4296.5 --> 4304.18
incorporated that social knowledge in

4299.71 --> 4305.95
storytelling concerning black people but

4304.18 --> 4308.68
they're types and all that it's just

4305.95 --> 4311.19
they know it they know the powers of

4308.68 --> 4311.1900000000005
black tea

4312.29 --> 4316.66
it's like they did yeah because in the

4315.08 --> 4319.12
thirties and the forties they most

4316.66 --> 4323.96
crimped all black people were Christians

4319.12 --> 4329.51
you know and very you know all that

4323.96 --> 4332.09
farming stone and all the soul music and

4329.51 --> 4334.1900000000005
all that sort of stuff and the preaching

4332.09 --> 4337.4800000000005
and the the whole lifestyle of it is

4334.19 --> 4340.639999999999
completely unique and very scary to

4337.48 --> 4342.65
anyone who doesn't who's trying to stop

4340.64 --> 4345.77
Christianity or is not a fan of

4342.65 --> 4348.41
Christianity and but now you got some

4345.77 --> 4353.570000000001
Christians and some less than a lot of

4348.41 --> 4356.12
Muslims and whatever you know New Age

4353.57 --> 4360.29
people or whatever but yeah I feel them

4356.12 --> 4364.3099999999995
yeah Christian we mail lots of retro

4360.29 --> 4367.54
there are a lot of witches well witches

4364.31 --> 4370.46
yeah there is that like go in the

4367.54 --> 4374.3
direction of old-fashioned foo do not

4370.46 --> 4378.22
necessarily harmful by the way so it's

4374.3 --> 4383.92
yeah that's popular among a lot of

4378.22 --> 4387.650000000001
African Americans as well I think ok

4383.92 --> 4392.06
yeah everybody goes their own direction

4387.65 --> 4394.61
I think that proportionally probably and

4392.06 --> 4396.4400000000005
I may be wrong with this but I think

4394.61 --> 4398.66
proportionally I think there's more

4396.44 --> 4401.239
atheists among white people than there

4398.66 --> 4403.61
are among black people one way or the

4401.239 --> 4407.209999999999
other doesn't have to be religious in a

4403.61 --> 4410.54
good way but I think that black people

4407.21 --> 4413.83
might have more tendencies to jump on

4410.54 --> 4416.239
some kind of religious thinking or

4413.83 --> 4420.23
spiritual direction because they just

4416.239 --> 4423.2
have more potency to wield it as it were

4420.23 --> 4425.9
and white people will probably have to

4423.2 --> 4428.03
dig a little deeper and most of them

4425.9 --> 4431.08
will just think they're so nonsense it's

4428.03 --> 4435.11
all it's all beliefs

4431.08 --> 4438.05
exactly exactly a good point I remember

4435.11 --> 4441.73
when the LA riots the Berkeley riots

4438.05 --> 4445.49
were on the answer far versus Trump

4441.73 --> 4448.37
supporters and all the anti-fur

4445.49 --> 4450.95
people were all white and they were

4448.37 --> 4452.599999999999
screaming now with the diverse group but

4450.95 --> 4455.51
they're all white kids middle class

4452.6 --> 4460.570000000001
white kids and all the people on the

4455.51 --> 4465.64
Trump side were Mexicans blacks Asians

4460.57 --> 4468.469999999999
you know mm-hmm and there was even

4465.64 --> 4474.17
hilarious is even a changed into dude on

4468.47 --> 4477.320000000001
the on the Trump side during the riot

4474.17 --> 4480.88
and he was right at the front you know

4477.32 --> 4483.71
he's like yeah good him was hilarious

4480.88 --> 4485.27
because it's there the other side are

4483.71 --> 4488.12
the ones who say hey we're the diverse

4485.27 --> 4490.72
ones but right yeah that's funny isn't

4488.12 --> 4496.73
it they're what they're all hypocrites

4490.72 --> 4501.01
and in in in fathomable levels there are

4496.73 --> 4503.53
all hypocrites hmm so they're literally

4501.01 --> 4506.900000000001
presenting something they're attacking

4503.53 --> 4509.8099999999995
what they are pretending not to be but

4506.9 --> 4512.0
are in full that's their system and they

4509.81 --> 4513.89
do it with everything it's it works

4512.0 --> 4517.94
that's the freaky thing about it somehow

4513.89 --> 4521.780000000001
works but not really it but it confuses

4517.94 --> 4526.549999999999
yes it burrows its way through through

4521.78 --> 4529.25
confusion and and Mesmer when you're

4526.55 --> 4536.4800000000005
super hypocritical with great energy

4529.25 --> 4539.33
that confuses people a lot yeah a lot of

4536.48 --> 4543.469999999999
people you know inflicted in shame and

4539.33 --> 4545.78
doubt and and that then infuses him hmm

4543.47 --> 4550.55
unless they're used to it unless they're

4545.78 --> 4553.34
prepared but not everybody is everybody

4550.55 --> 4555.650000000001
gets to hear the superficial liberal way

4553.34 --> 4557.39
of thinking and all that but yeah when

4555.65 --> 4559.4
you're face to face with a bunch of

4557.39 --> 4561.92
assaulting social justice warrior that

4559.4 --> 4564.469999999999
I'd like forcing their way to try it to

4561.92 --> 4566.54
make you change your company policy or

4564.47 --> 4571.04
whatever it's gonna be very overwhelming

4566.54 --> 4572.48
because they go way too far with

4571.04 --> 4574.1
everything and they're angry too they're

4572.48 --> 4578.03
extremely angry as well yeah and they go

4574.1 --> 4579.110000000001
too far with everything hmm they saw sir

4578.03 --> 4582.639
justice worth

4579.11 --> 4586.13
going all they really try to blackmail

4582.639 --> 4589.52
even or manipulate yeah like threatened

4586.13 --> 4594.7390000000005
people if they think it's necessary to

4589.52 --> 4596.09
achieve their goals sometimes yeah they

4594.739 --> 4598.599999999999
think it's they think it's okay to just

4596.09 --> 4601.52
go up and punch someone in the face

4598.6 --> 4610.06
thing and not Susan Rice justifies the

4601.52 --> 4610.06
means that is their methodology exactly

4610.21 --> 4614.6
[Music]

4611.98 --> 4620.0599999999995
so yeah black love met her another group

4614.6 --> 4623.33
as well super hypocritical hmm but Jesse

4620.06 --> 4627.159000000001
Lee says he says there's no such thing

4623.33 --> 4630.199
as racism there is good and is evil but

4627.159 --> 4631.549999999999
no one hates anyone just because the

4630.199 --> 4635.36
color of their skin or where they're

4631.55 --> 4637.7300000000005
from you know that's not logical people

4635.36 --> 4639.92
just hate people because they just hate

4637.73 --> 4642.08
them not because they're black or the

4639.92 --> 4645.619
yellow or whatever this scheme and never

4642.08 --> 4649.699
hate him either people fear other people

4645.619 --> 4652.94
or they hate the attitude and then they

4649.699 --> 4655.07
might oversimplify that attitude with

4652.94 --> 4660.469
the association of they're out of their

4655.07 --> 4662.929
looks or region and that becomes tied in

4660.469 --> 4665.03
together and that anchors itself and if

4662.929 --> 4668.389
you let it then you do get into yourself

4665.03 --> 4671.389
consciousness that's how really a baby

4668.389 --> 4674.75
just that's how real bigotry arrives in

4671.389 --> 4677.3
people by terrible experiences not

4674.75 --> 4680.83
really dealing with it and then the the

4677.3 --> 4683.54
moment the appearance and the act it all

4680.83 --> 4687.429
associates tied in together and sinks in

4683.54 --> 4687.429
the back of your self consciousness

4687.489 --> 4691.599999999999
that's how bigotry arises

4693.5 --> 4708.33
basically not dealing with issues polish

4703.8 --> 4710.88
ballers have a to not dealing with

4708.33 --> 4712.62
issues well if if a group of people is

4710.88 --> 4716.1
definitely not dealing with the issues

4712.62 --> 4717.98
it's the ballers they've made a mental

4716.1 --> 4723.900000000001
sport out of it

4717.98 --> 4729.299999999999
literally have you heard fought the

4723.9 --> 4731.82
flutters go off when Evie Evie sings

4729.3 --> 4734.91
channel or anything oh yeah I've heard

4731.82 --> 4736.5
about him seen some holy moley

4734.91 --> 4737.94
he just weren't shot up at either he

4736.5 --> 4741.87
just goes on and on

4737.94 --> 4747.589999999999
and scotland's totally jacking himself

4741.87 --> 4751.8
off mentally but that's what they all do

4747.59 --> 4756.33
they're just like send like all sense

4751.8 --> 4759.72
the victory of my improvisation being

4756.33 --> 4762.57
worshipped that's because they are

4759.72 --> 4765.84
technically kind of improvising they

4762.57 --> 4767.849999999999
really believe it is this case and they

4765.84 --> 4769.9800000000005
build everything as they go they they

4767.85 --> 4771.3
try to work with whatever they come

4769.98 --> 4775.62
across it's kind of the same what

4771.3 --> 4778.05
flat-earthers do except we really try to

4775.62 --> 4780.51
fit it in the bigger picture and it must

4778.05 --> 4783.0
all really work and they just slop and

4780.51 --> 4785.22
put it together and if it works in a

4783.0 --> 4787.77
short confined then it's good to them

4785.22 --> 4790.5
but if it doesn't fit fit in the whole

4787.77 --> 4794.610000000001
picture it's just so big this must be

4790.5 --> 4797.34
some detail there must be a mistake

4794.61 --> 4801.78
yeah no the confusion will just blur up

4797.34 --> 4806.85
that hole because it's so big they made

4801.78 --> 4809.07
it too big too to get a proper grip on

4806.85 --> 4815.370000000001
and that's part of the strategy to

4809.07 --> 4820.08
conceal the holes yeah a lot of loose

4815.37 --> 4822.86
threads so yeah yeah I'm torn we're

4820.08 --> 4822.86
still working on it

4824.19 --> 4829.12

4878.82 --> 4885.16
like I forced myself at a certain age to

4881.98 --> 4888.849999999999
learn the square roots especially in

4885.16 --> 4892.83
like multiplication table from 1 to 13

4888.85 --> 4896.46
so like 169 was like the final number

4892.83 --> 4899.23
within that frame so it's special to me

4896.46 --> 4899.86
