no sexual references oh [ __ ] did it was

2470.119 --> 2478.3700000000003
there some innuendo there that I

2474.28 --> 2481.48
yeah okay I that I didn't pick up on

2485.24 --> 2489.839
that

2486.76 --> 2489.8390000000004

means okay

2494.52 --> 2499.599
yeah I I definitely did not pick up on

2504.599 --> 2512.56
that right because in my world view not

2509.359 --> 2516.2799999999997
every freaking word is a reference to a

2512.56 --> 2520.7599999999998
sex organ or a sexual deed you see in my

2520.76 --> 2524.5200000000004
that

2521.599 --> 2526.48
simple so I just don't think about those

2524.52 --> 2528.68
things sometimes when I try to formulate

2526.48 --> 2531.319
something funny I'm trying to formulate

2528.68 --> 2533.96
it funny based on it sounding funny not

2531.319 --> 2536.56
on it being oh it's a sexual

2533.96 --> 2541.64
reference because I don't think like

2536.56 --> 2541.64
that I'm not a dirty grabler you

2886.559 --> 2892.88
any trouble okay leave each other alone

2889.8 --> 2895.88
everybody it's

2892.88 --> 2896.92
autum people get cranked easily don't go

2895.88 --> 2900.2000000000003
poking

2896.92 --> 2900.2000000000003
around like

2904.64 --> 2907.64
that

2907.92 --> 2914.0
need to read a lot of definitions

2911.599 --> 2917.1600000000003
duper there's no point though I mean

2914.0 --> 2917.16
he's going to forget them

2918.4 --> 2923.92
anyway I bet dupers looked up a whole

2921.319 --> 2924.7599999999998
bunch of things and every time he looked

2923.92 --> 2928.4
them

2924.76 --> 2930.079
up he just didn't get it I think duper

2928.4 --> 2932.319
is one of those guys that looks up

2930.079 --> 2934.599
things and then just it just turns to

2932.319 --> 2937.599
[ __ ] you just can't read

2934.599 --> 2943.2400000000002
it am I anywhere near duper do you have

2937.599 --> 2943.2400000000002
like some sort of uh dyslectic

2949.0 --> 2955.799
issue where it's just like if your

2952.48 --> 2960.4
spirit just says no you just can't read

2955.799 --> 2964.52
it correct I knew it see I know duper I

2960.4 --> 2967.52
know how he works I get I get how that

2964.52 --> 2967.52
works

2968.28 --> 2974.76
so his inner demon is effectively just

2971.16 --> 2974.7599999999998
disabling him from moving

2974.799 --> 2981.24
on in other words he is genuinely a

2977.88 --> 2984.88
Ballard and his spirit is preventing him

2981.24 --> 2989.1189999999997
from moving on I mean I don't know how

2984.88 --> 2989.119
much clearer an example you could

2994.28 --> 3000.119
get right

2997.079 --> 3002.8390000000004
it just he just needs a lot of time to

3000.119 --> 3005.48
work through all of it and to realize

3002.839 --> 3007.72
how he works and

3005.48 --> 3012.079
then choose what he's going to do with

3007.72 --> 3012.0789999999997
it and every time he chooses it changes

3016.72 --> 3026.2799999999997
something even if he chooses not to not

3022.2 --> 3029.16
to work towards figuring it actually

3026.28 --> 3031.3590000000004
out then it will still change him that's

3029.16 --> 3034.5589999999997
the predicament he's at I know all about

3031.359 --> 3037.44
it I used to be there I had a lot of

3034.559 --> 3039.2400000000002
that like dyslectic type obstruction

3037.44 --> 3043.16
where it's like you have to learn this

3039.24 --> 3043.16
and it's just like it just won't

3043.359 --> 3049.839
work just can't get it to get ordered

3047.0 --> 3052.72
and assimilated like there's something

3049.839 --> 3057.44
inside of me that's like pushing back

3052.72 --> 3057.4399999999996
making me unable to focus on it

3058.96 --> 3064.16
have we agreed on the shape of Earth

3061.96 --> 3067.559
well that depends the shape of the realm

3064.16 --> 3070.5589999999997
or the shape of the dirt you're standing

3067.559 --> 3070.559
on

3072.88 --> 3080.599
Jason cuz yeah the realm could could be

3076.119 --> 3080.599
a cube it could indeed be a Hol

3080.799 --> 3087.359
cube of spatial Dimensions or

3083.559 --> 3087.3590000000004
rectangular if you will

3096.68 --> 3102.5589999999997
you know what you believe yeah without

3098.839 --> 3105.4
any reason though like without any

3102.559 --> 3108.44
logical hint or

3105.4 --> 3112.04
anything it's just some weird thing

3108.44 --> 3114.76
somebody told you one time and you fell

3112.04 --> 3117.04
in love with it and you you won't let go

3114.76 --> 3120.5200000000004
even though there's literally nothing

3117.04 --> 3123.319
that you know that that that logically

3120.52 --> 3125.24
leads you to believe what you believe

3123.319 --> 3127.5589999999997
about the shape of the earth Jason

3125.24 --> 3131.04
mccormac

3127.559 --> 3131.0400000000004
nothing there's

3138.599 --> 3143.4
nothing you just fell in love with the

3141.119 --> 3147.28
Reversed Globe it's the same [ __ ]

3143.4 --> 3147.28
Jason it's just more dumb

3148.119 --> 3155.0
cuz you have less material to back

3151.24 --> 3155.0
anything logically about

3155.44 --> 3160.4
it container

3158.079 --> 3163.0
Earth yeah well the ground isn't

3160.4 --> 3167.1600000000003
containing us Jason the ground we stand

3163.0 --> 3169.0
on is definitely not surrounding us and

3167.16 --> 3171.2799999999997
enabling gas

3169.0 --> 3174.24
pressure it's not the ground that's

3171.28 --> 3176.599
doing that you

3174.24 --> 3178.68
see

3176.599 --> 3183.799
ground is

3178.68 --> 3186.0
only forming a barrier on one side of

3183.799 --> 3186.0
the

3188.16 --> 3194.7599999999998
container yeah there is a limitation to

3191.24 --> 3196.72
the amount of volume not because of the

3194.76 --> 3200.5200000000004
earth

3196.72 --> 3203.3999999999996
pressing there's other sides that aren't

3200.52 --> 3203.4
covered in

3204.16 --> 3209.839
dirt yeah there is containment there is

3207.28 --> 3213.2400000000002
gas pressure the Earth is not

3209.839 --> 3215.599
surrounding us on all

3213.24 --> 3219.7599999999998
sides there's no

3215.599 --> 3219.76
lead there's not even a

3221.2 --> 3225.7599999999998
lead to suggest that it

3234.16 --> 3237.16
is

3239.48 --> 3246.839
yeah the dirt we stand on is not the

3243.319 --> 3249.04
container the dirt we stand on is not

3246.839 --> 3249.04
the

3251.64 --> 3260.359
container so that's that it's done it's

3255.839 --> 3264.0789999999997
over what you believe is not

3260.359 --> 3266.48
true the dirt you stand on is not the

3264.079 --> 3269.48
container

3266.48 --> 3269.48
yeah

3269.96 --> 3276.839
over there's just things about the

3273.72 --> 3279.9599999999996
dimensions of this place that you don't

3276.839 --> 3282.119
know that I don't know with certainty

3279.96 --> 3284.28
that we can speculate about but we don't

3282.119 --> 3287.92
know but what we do know is that the

3284.28 --> 3290.69
dirt is not surrounding us and forming

3287.92 --> 3293.9
the container for the

3290.69 --> 3293.9
[Music]

3294.079 --> 3297.079
gas

3299.839 --> 3307.64
do you think sometimes that December is

3303.28 --> 3309.1600000000003
when you can escape the looping realm s

3307.64 --> 3312.16
enters the

3309.16 --> 3312.16
end

3313.28 --> 3321.3190000000004
what okay well I haven't drawn any

3317.079 --> 3324.039
logical conclusions for

3321.319 --> 3327.0
that I don't know maybe there is a loop

3324.039 --> 3327.0
gate that is theend

3327.359 --> 3334.359
on on yeah astrological positions or

3331.0 --> 3334.359
whatever how do I

3354.0 --> 3357.0
know

3359.52 --> 3364.559
yeah everybody hates the looping Pac-Man

3361.839 --> 3366.24
World nobody wants to face it everybody

3364.559 --> 3369.799
hates it the flat earthers hate it the

3366.24 --> 3372.0389999999998
globers hate it they are like well yeah

3369.799 --> 3375.4
it might be like oh you might believe

3372.039 --> 3378.7200000000003
it's a disc and that's stupid but

3375.4 --> 3382.2400000000002
freaking looping Pac-Man World no you're

3378.72 --> 3383.839
the scum of the earth you're evil

3382.24 --> 3387.4399999999996
because you believe something that's

3383.839 --> 3387.44
just like so of puting it's

3388.16 --> 3393.0389999999998
like

3389.72 --> 3398.319
right I bet a lot of people have

3393.039 --> 3400.6800000000003
that looping Pac-Man World it's a

3398.319 --> 3404.079
disgrace yeah well the more those types

3400.68 --> 3406.44
of responses pop up the more you know

3404.079 --> 3410.079
it's probably

3406.44 --> 3412.88
real the higher the allergic allergic

3410.079 --> 3413.88
reaction to the the person that's not in

3412.88 --> 3418.079
the

3413.88 --> 3422.44
no the more likely it's actually

3418.079 --> 3426.6400000000003
real no it's not interesting Jason

3422.44 --> 3429.799
mccormac the dirt is not surrounding us

3426.64 --> 3433.2
it's not interesting you you want to get

3429.799 --> 3433.2
kicked the [ __ ] out again

3433.28 --> 3441.44
Jason I you you will not be enthusiastic

3437.599 --> 3444.88
about something that you have no lead

3441.44 --> 3447.7200000000003
for you don't even have a lead it's a

3444.88 --> 3450.2000000000003
stupid dumbass Hollow

3447.72 --> 3454.16
Superstition that you have no

3450.2 --> 3457.3999999999996
information based logic based lead to

3454.16 --> 3460.16
Bel other than some [ __ ] weirdo told

3457.4 --> 3466.2400000000002
you one time and you absorbed it like a

3460.16 --> 3466.24
cultist yeah that's it that is

3468.24 --> 3476.2799999999997
all there's no competition with any

3471.64 --> 3479.64
model in relation to what you believe

3476.28 --> 3484.079
yeah because you have no leads to

3479.64 --> 3484.0789999999997
reality in any form with your

3484.359 --> 3489.44
belief yeah the dirt does not surround

3490.03 --> 3493.079
[Music]

3494.64 --> 3502.4
us there is no ground above us

3499.52 --> 3505.96
yeah or beside

3502.4 --> 3508.119
us the horizon

3505.96 --> 3511.44
is not

3508.119 --> 3515.2000000000003
geometric yeah when we take a telescope

3511.44 --> 3520.44
and we look at the Horizon you don't

3515.2 --> 3523.8799999999997
see something from the side yeah which

3520.44 --> 3526.48
if it was concave is what you see you

3523.88 --> 3526.48
don't see

3531.039 --> 3535.7990000000004
it hey what what are you doing clutch no

3533.839 --> 3538.52
need for that

3535.799 --> 3538.52
why you doing

3541.68 --> 3549.799
that now now you just deleted the chat

3544.92 --> 3549.799
tree clutch thanks a lot for

3551.359 --> 3556.4
that now it just sounds like I'm talking

3554.039 --> 3556.4
to

3556.48 --> 3562.799
myself you did not do it yeah you did

3560.119 --> 3562.799
it's right

3563.64 --> 3566.64
there

3580.359 --> 3587.839
that was not you you swear okay well in

3584.319 --> 3591.48
that case then your account is

3587.839 --> 3591.48
compromised I'm sorry

3592.599 --> 3596.6400000000003
but it's right there

3599.839 --> 3603.52
I mean am I the only one seeing

3604.799 --> 3608.16
that no it

3619.16 --> 3623.3999999999996
wasn't right that's weird

3623.559 --> 3627.88
clutch

3625.24 --> 3630.8799999999997
yeah take taking it for precaution this

3627.88 --> 3632.76
is just weird like how maybe there's

3630.88 --> 3636.2400000000002
like another

3632.76 --> 3636.2400000000002
clutch I'll check

3641.2 --> 3648.7599999999998
it there's some weird going on not

3645.039 --> 3648.76
taking this like you don't see it as a

3650.68 --> 3656.52
punishment more

3653.52 --> 3656.52
security

3674.799 --> 3677.7599999999998
what the

3680.28 --> 3686.44
[ __ ] what the [ __ ] was

3683.44 --> 3686.44
that

3696.52 --> 3699.52
he was still in

3704.4 --> 3708.44
there there's something really weird

3707.079 --> 3712.2400000000002
going

3708.44 --> 3716.44
on okay I well I just gave you a wrench

3712.24 --> 3716.4399999999996
back let's see

3729.48 --> 3734.4
there might be some delay or something

3731.559 --> 3734.4
that was weird

3743.359 --> 3746.359
though

3772.599 --> 3776.559
fake clutch won't be able to I don't

3774.359 --> 3776.5589999999997
don't

3781.4 --> 3785.96
know it's just really odd

3803.279 --> 3806.279
man

3815.64 --> 3821.4
it might have just been a

3817.64 --> 3821.4
fluke just something

3833.279 --> 3836.279
weird

3852.48 --> 3855.88
yeah everything else seems

3858.24 --> 3861.24
fine

3863.2 --> 3866.2
right

3870.64 --> 3876.5589999999997
that's right

3872.2 --> 3876.5589999999997
doer physics is science

3877.279 --> 3880.279
indeed

3881.359 --> 3887.64
huh yeah I just did steamy traveler uh

3885.48 --> 3890.76
probably not I think it's just a fluke

3887.64 --> 3892.8799999999997
there was just a little delay in like I

3890.76 --> 3895.4
banned him in the chat and expected that

3892.88 --> 3898.2000000000003
it would immediately with a refresh just

3895.4 --> 3900.64
change in the in the

3898.2 --> 3902.5989999999997
list but there was probably just a

3900.64 --> 3905.799
slight

3902.599 --> 3908.3590000000004
delay right and yeah whatever happened

3905.799 --> 3911.24
there that was just probably a weird

3908.359 --> 3914.52
little fluke or maybe you just kept

3911.24 --> 3917.319
hanging over it and

3914.52 --> 3919.52
then moved away and then just

3917.319 --> 3923.079
accidentally like timed them out

3919.52 --> 3926.079
anyway I'm sure you didn't do it on

3923.079 --> 3926.079
purpose

3927.24 --> 3930.7599999999998
no I'm not going to wrench you Jason you

3929.52 --> 3934.24
[ __ ]

3930.76 --> 3938.2400000000002
[ __ ] now I'm timing you out you say

3934.24 --> 3938.24
that again and you're [ __ ] out of

3939.52 --> 3942.52
here

3950.039 --> 3957.6800000000003
idiot what's in the rules what's right

3953.2 --> 3961.48
there for years and years and years yeah

3957.68 --> 3961.48
you don't ask for a

3976.01 --> 3979.48
[Music]

3977.319 --> 3981.799
wrench right and if you're going to be

3979.48 --> 3983.48
here all whiny and complaining of how

3981.799 --> 3986.44
you're treated then just get the [ __ ]

3983.48 --> 3989.52
out you want to hang around here have a

3986.44 --> 3992.2000000000003
conversation that's one thing keep your

3989.52 --> 3994.319
crazy beliefs out of it and it's all

3992.2 --> 3996.7599999999998
good but that doesn't mean you have any

3994.319 --> 3998.68
form of Rights if some accident happened

3996.76 --> 4001.4
somebody times you out or

3998.68 --> 4004.7599999999998
whatever that's no reason to start

4001.4 --> 4007.599
making demands yeah I'll just kick you

4004.76 --> 4007.599
out then

4011.559 --> 4018.079
Jason but it didn't hide messages no the

4014.76 --> 4021.079
message is already gone can

4018.079 --> 4023.319
bear once you do a timeout all previous

4021.079 --> 4026.44
messages are

4023.319 --> 4028.16
deleted if I then time them out again

4339.76 --> 4345.4800000000005
about his whole way of seeing it

[Music]

4417.12 --> 4421.159
doing you're the hor

4424.12 --> 4430.199
[ __ ] but but horeshit is a very popular

4427.4 --> 4432.08
cuss word now a lot of people say it oh

4430.199 --> 4434.96
Benjamin says it all the

4432.08 --> 4437.639
time I say it all the time horse [ __ ] is

like the new

4437.92 --> 4441.149
[Music]

4461.639 --> 4467.76
[ __ ] and as o

4464.76 --> 4467.76
e

4469.239 --> 4473.48
what what the hell does that mean

4482.96 --> 4490.4
DED oh not so obvious establishment

4486.92 --> 4495.28
right lots of guys are still by yeah no

4490.4 --> 4495.28
but most people teret most people

4497.159 --> 4500.92
because the Brotherhood of scammers is

4498.8 --> 4504.400000000001
very appealing I mean they always say

4500.92 --> 4507.4
exactly what you want to hear every time

4504.4 --> 4510.638999999999
they're professionals professional

4507.4 --> 4513.799999999999
Shields they're professional truth or

4510.639 --> 4515.32
shells that say exactly what you want to

4513.8 --> 4519.639
[Music]

4515.32 --> 4522.5199999999995
hear make you put all in on them and

4519.639 --> 4525.4400000000005
then when they win they [ __ ] you over

4522.52 --> 4526.96
and then they just completely do it a

4525.44 --> 4530.12
different way and then there's nothing

4526.96 --> 4533.44
left for you to do then you lost that's

4530.12 --> 4537.04
their tactic that's the not so obvious

4533.44 --> 4537.04
establishment the Brotherhood of

4537.88 --> 4544.08
scammers they have teams that like go

4541.239 --> 4547.04
around scan around to figure out what is

4544.08 --> 4549.88
the most popular

4547.04 --> 4551.84
trait what are the most popular traits

4549.88 --> 4554.92
and ways of saying

4551.84 --> 4558.4400000000005
things that everybody will immediately

4554.92 --> 4562.76
in intuitively like get

4558.44 --> 4565.879999999999
behind or instinctually get behind right

4562.76 --> 4569.0
and that's how they then construct their

4565.88 --> 4571.6
narrative they say exactly what you what

4569.0 --> 4571.6
you want to

4574.76 --> 4577.76
hear

4582.12 --> 4586.199
right

4584.0 --> 4587.719
and it's very hard not to buy into it

4586.199 --> 4591.5199999999995
because that's kind of like what

4587.719 --> 4593.8
politics is right it's like who has the

4591.52 --> 4593.8
best

4595.679 --> 4604.28
lies who can still arouse some hope in

4599.76 --> 4604.280000000001
you that they will actually change

4608.44 --> 4614.199
something cuz that will draw in all

4610.88 --> 4617.1990000000005
these people's Energies

4614.199 --> 4617.199
they can feed of

4618.12 --> 4624.53
[Music]

4631.76 --> 4636.4400000000005
that high production content what does

4634.56 --> 4639.4400000000005
that mean

4636.44 --> 4639.44
teret

4642.0 --> 4645.0
exactly

4668.4 --> 4675.0
I mean high production content as in

4671.719 --> 4675.0
pre-recorded videos

4679.239 --> 4682.839999999999
where they make a lot of effort for the

4683.84 --> 4688.1990000000005
presentation like NASA

4701.92 --> 4706.719
right

4704.48 --> 4709.239
that's fine Jason you go do

4706.719 --> 4711.719
that just know that the dirt does not

4709.239 --> 4711.718999999999
surround

4715.36 --> 4719.92
you no dream

4718.32 --> 4723.0
idea

4719.92 --> 4726.08
Vision or worldly change is going to

4723.0 --> 4728.52
make your belief the reality Jason just

4726.08 --> 4728.5199999999995
so you

4731.92 --> 4734.92
know

4740.48 --> 4745.08
Nathan didn't mention physic using the

4742.96 --> 4749.4
scientific method are you kidding me

4745.08 --> 4752.159
duper you really forget things don't you

4749.4 --> 4755.44

4760.6 --> 4765.320000000001
weeks ago too and forgot all about it

4762.92 --> 4767.88
you seem to be forgetting about things

4765.32 --> 4767.88
all the time

4769.12 --> 4774.5199999999995
duper you keep finding things out and

4771.84 --> 4776.92
then you forget about it

4774.52 --> 4778.56
again and then you find it out and then

4776.92 --> 4780.36
you think you find it out for the first

4778.56 --> 4782.84
time it's just because you forgot that

4780.36 --> 4783.92
you already did find it out and forget

4782.84 --> 4788.08
it

4783.92 --> 4788.08

right but why ter me are still talking

4839.719 --> 4845.6
about that is

4842.76 --> 4849.320000000001

slightly altered to

4894.76 --> 4902.4400000000005

4899.8 --> 4906.28
that are out there still right which the

4902.44 --> 4906.28
Brotherhood of scammers definitely help

4907.48 --> 4910.839999999999
uphold all the

4911.639 --> 4914.639
[ __ ]

4916.48 --> 4921.5199999999995
most people find him too annoying to be

4955.52 --> 4960.76

4958.12 --> 4961.84
politician but pretending to be on the

4960.76 --> 4965.96
other

4961.84 --> 4969.52
side he's really really

4965.96 --> 4969.52
gross Shiva

4969.96 --> 4975.2390000000005
humulus that's hilarious slowo moon

4972.28 --> 4978.8
buggy but a sha humulus would be more

4975.239 --> 4978.799999999999
brilliant than

4979.85 --> 4983.27
[Music]

4983.52 --> 4989.4400000000005
FC like Pierce Morgan yeah yeah that's a

4986.36 --> 4989.44
good comparison

4990.04 --> 4995.36
yeah you like f yeah I'm sure you do cuz

4993.4 --> 4997.96
you're a [ __ ] dumbass who believes

4995.36 --> 5001.48
that is surrounded by dirt

4997.96 --> 5005.04
Jason so of course you'll fall for

5001.48 --> 5007.44
that because fif has a list of things

5005.04 --> 5011.04
that he says that has been assembled by

5007.44 --> 5014.159
wide spectrum research to say

5011.04 --> 5017.679
exactly what you want to hear how you

5014.159 --> 5021.96
want to hear it even though the guy is

5017.679 --> 5021.96
literally an X big Pharma

5023.0 --> 5028.719
shill and he's he's supposedly over that

5026.159 --> 5030.48
now right but you don't really get into

5028.719 --> 5032.4800000000005
the details of any of that if you want

5030.48 --> 5036.759999999999
to hear the details of that then just

5032.48 --> 5040.839999999999
listen into Dr shiva's stream yeah the

5036.76 --> 5042.2390000000005
guy that ramaswami will never say his

5040.84 --> 5046.28
name

5042.239 --> 5047.959999999999
ever because he knows he is a

5046.28 --> 5051.88
designated

5047.96 --> 5055.4800000000005
clone to replace him so he will never

5051.88 --> 5055.4800000000005
say Dr shiva's name

5056.12 --> 5062.76
ever and that's also why I think that a

5058.92 --> 5065.4
debate between him and Dr Shiva is never

5062.76 --> 5065.400000000001
ever going to

5066.4 --> 5071.92
happen cuz he could never control that

5070.0 --> 5073.96
Dr Shiva is going to make minced meat

5071.92 --> 5077.84
out of

5073.96 --> 5080.679
him like Japanese

5077.84 --> 5085.04
cook and he knows it so it's never going

5080.679 --> 5087.32
to happen but Dr Shiva couldn't review

5085.04 --> 5089.88
his interview with Alex Jones when he

5087.32 --> 5094.48
really was like was like oh I've won

5089.88 --> 5097.92
like he's like I've won he was like

5094.48 --> 5100.0
that Trump not so obvious

5097.92 --> 5100.92
establishment yeah but in a different

5100.0 --> 5104.76
way

5100.92 --> 5107.32
though I mean Trump and Owen talks ow

5104.76 --> 5108.8
Benjamin talks about this well Trump is

5107.32 --> 5111.88
more

5108.8 --> 5113.8
like he's more beholden to the mega

5111.88 --> 5116.56
Banks

5113.8 --> 5118.84
basically cuz that guy has like infinite

5116.56 --> 5121.400000000001
debt that he can never pay off so he's

5118.84 --> 5125.08
like basically a sto for the banks but

5121.4 --> 5129.4
he not because he loves the back it's

5125.08 --> 5129.4
just that he's their slave sort

5135.52 --> 5142.2390000000005
of but there's one thing about

5139.199 --> 5146.5599999999995
Trump and that is he is really good for

5142.239 --> 5150.759999999999
morale except for sjws and Marxist which

5146.56 --> 5153.52
all go completely AP [ __ ] over

5150.76 --> 5155.8
him but who the [ __ ] gifts about those

5153.52 --> 5159.96
people

5155.8 --> 5161.96
anyway right for people actually matter

5159.96 --> 5165.96
and that like to work and all that and

5161.96 --> 5168.92
be productive and be cohesive

5165.96 --> 5172.56
nationalist he's great for morale like

5168.92 --> 5176.2390000000005
even if he is a a goof up and he makes

5172.56 --> 5178.59
really weird decisions and does a

5176.239 --> 5181.199
symmetrical move

5178.59 --> 5183.32
[Music]

5181.199 --> 5186.119
sometimes

5183.32 --> 5190.239
yeah and he created space

5186.119 --> 5193.0
force that's right and operation warp

5190.239 --> 5197.32
speed and

5193.0 --> 5197.32
yep again he is Brotherhood of

5206.32 --> 5214.199
scammers but despite all of that on a

5209.92 --> 5214.1990000000005
temporary level is still good for

5214.32 --> 5220.719
morale and he would probably be much

5217.32 --> 5224.48
more successful in actually creating

5220.719 --> 5226.44
peace on a geopolitical theater that's

5224.48 --> 5228.36
the one thing that like people don't

5226.44 --> 5231.5199999999995
really

5228.36 --> 5233.119
get cuz the media tells like oh he's

5231.52 --> 5234.96
going to create World War III he's going

5233.119 --> 5237.44
to destroy everything that's because

5234.96 --> 5240.56
that's absolute hor [ __ ] he he

5237.44 --> 5243.5599999999995
actually kind of does the opposite of

5240.56 --> 5246.4400000000005
that with his in fluence on the

5243.56 --> 5248.84
geopolitical scale right not talking you

5246.44 --> 5251.5599999999995
always have to separate that National

5248.84 --> 5256.28
policy versus

5251.56 --> 5256.280000000001
geopolitical so very different

5257.22 --> 5261.189
[Music]

5262.52 --> 5267.719
influences he DOD is dodgy ass L yeah he

5265.6 --> 5269.52
got some grabler lawyers but I mean you

5267.719 --> 5271.119
have to have grabler lawyers if you're

5269.52 --> 5272.76
beholden to a

5271.119 --> 5275.759999999999
grabler

5272.76 --> 5277.96
and he is beholden to gravers so he gets

5275.76 --> 5277.96
their

5290.76 --> 5295.719
lawyers it's really weird when you think

5293.08 --> 5299.32
about it that in some

5295.719 --> 5303.0
way he kind of is like the Deep State

5299.32 --> 5306.96
except he's like a slave

5303.0 --> 5310.56
but he's not gring he's actually like

5306.96 --> 5313.2390000000005
trying to resist as a

5310.56 --> 5316.2390000000005
slave so he's like a slave of the deep

5313.239 --> 5319.759999999999
state that is trying to resist from his

5316.239 --> 5319.759999999999
slave position to the Deep

5320.56 --> 5327.92
state with abilities to manage the hord

5325.719 --> 5330.0
the the group that the Deep State wants

5327.92 --> 5332.119
to control and that's the weird thing

5330.0 --> 5334.48
about it right there's this really weird

5332.119 --> 5337.32
dynamic in that sense in my view I mean

5334.48 --> 5340.678999999999
oh got it probably got it wrong

5337.32 --> 5343.799999999999
Arwin Arwin gets it wrong I don't know

5340.679 --> 5346.159
man listen to Fox or day or something oh

5343.8 --> 5349.84
I'm sure he'll be able to give a much

5346.159 --> 5352.28
more credible will researched picture or

5349.84 --> 5354.1990000000005
whatever but I get this feeling a lot

5352.28 --> 5357.88
with Trump like he's

5354.199 --> 5361.119
actually like he is the Deep State he's

5357.88 --> 5363.92
just not working along with the plan of

5361.119 --> 5366.239
the deep state

5363.92 --> 5368.28
I was thought like he actually secretly

5366.239 --> 5371.759999999999
wants to replace the Deep

5368.28 --> 5375.119
State like Trump wants to be the Deep

5371.76 --> 5377.360000000001
State and like take all of that over to

5375.119 --> 5379.5199999999995
save his America wherever that's going

5377.36 --> 5379.5199999999995
to

5381.36 --> 5389.239
lead well the Deep State operators that

5385.0 --> 5390.92
are in there right now are pure Marxist

5389.239 --> 5393.44
self-destruction they're literally

5390.92 --> 5395.6
burning everything up to sit on the on

5393.44 --> 5397.96
the throne of gold basically in their

5395.6 --> 5400.52
minds they're mostly sitting on a throne

5397.96 --> 5403.719
of skulls

5400.52 --> 5406.88
though right and he Trump does not want

5403.719 --> 5409.08
that he wants America to be great again

5406.88 --> 5411.159000000001
and so he kind of like wants to take

5409.08 --> 5414.36
over the Deep State he wants to replace

5411.159 --> 5418.44
that not take it away not Mo move it

5414.36 --> 5420.799999999999
back to an old type us wants to take it

5418.44 --> 5420.799999999999
all

5420.84 --> 5423.84
forward

5426.04 --> 5430.56
and I think that Trump probably wants to

5428.32 --> 5433.5599999999995
achieve something that's like closer to

5430.56 --> 5433.56
like what Putin's

5434.32 --> 5439.04
achieved he wants to be like that

5436.96 --> 5442.4
Cornerstone

5439.04 --> 5445.159
figure that that's keeping everything

5442.4 --> 5450.679
together he's Pro dude Trump is probably

5445.159 --> 5452.679
jealous as [ __ ] of Putin secretly just

5450.679 --> 5457.159
like all that respect that Putin

5452.679 --> 5460.6
actually gets internationally like Trump

5457.159 --> 5463.4
like really does not like that like he

5460.6 --> 5467.52
wants that he wants to be the number one

5463.4 --> 5469.839999999999
world hero you know it you know he's got

5467.52 --> 5469.84
to be

5474.639 --> 5479.92
jealous we want to drain the swamp We

5477.48 --> 5484.0
the People yeah well rum's got hit rump

5479.92 --> 5484.0
is Trump is just another Tree in the

5484.76 --> 5489.52
swamp he's got his roots right in there

5487.8 --> 5493.1990000000005
he is a swamp

5489.52 --> 5495.639
monster he's just a different kind of

5493.199 --> 5495.638999999999
swamp

5501.04 --> 5506.84
monster and I'd say like definitely a

5504.6 --> 5510.360000000001
better type of swamp monster I mean if

5506.84 --> 5512.88
you're going to have a swamp then I I'd

5510.36 --> 5517.199
rather have a bunch of trump trees in

5512.88 --> 5519.08
that swamp than those rotting disgusting

5517.199 --> 5521.44
things that are like hanging in there

5519.08 --> 5523.88
now that are just like pure demonic and

5521.44 --> 5525.759999999999
all that I'd much rather have a bunch of

5523.88 --> 5528.28
trump trees in the

5525.76 --> 5530.6
swamp although on the long run I'll

5528.28 --> 5533.92
probably be sorry about it all the world

5530.6 --> 5536.4800000000005
will be sorry at some point maybe maybe

5533.92 --> 5536.4800000000005
not who

5540.679 --> 5543.679
knows

5549.159 --> 5554.44
well Aries yeah that's really nice maybe

5552.0 --> 5557.159
he does maybe Trump actually does

5554.44 --> 5559.199
secretly want that but if he wants to be

5557.159 --> 5563.44
an emperor for life then he still wants

5559.199 --> 5566.0
to be seen as benevolent he doesn't just

5563.44 --> 5571.0
he's not a guy that like enjoys to be

5566.0 --> 5576.04
hated and feared you see he actually

5571.0 --> 5579.679
physically enjoys to be loved and

5576.04 --> 5582.88
admired so if he's going to maneuver to

5579.679 --> 5585.88
some Emperor for life scenario for

5582.88 --> 5587.96
himself well he's probably not even

5585.88 --> 5591.4400000000005
going to be the worst type of Emperor

5587.96 --> 5596.199
then although really weird and clumsy

5591.44 --> 5596.199
and maybe at some in some

5600.56 --> 5608.1990000000005
things

5602.92 --> 5610.56
right but I mean try to compare it a

5608.199 --> 5613.159
trump being an emperor or this [ __ ]

5610.56 --> 5615.679
deep State [ __ ] that we are having right

5613.159 --> 5618.08
now where literally like they're

5615.679 --> 5621.6
actively like

5618.08 --> 5624.199
with with enthusiasm trying to

5621.6 --> 5628.360000000001
exterminate everybody get everybody

5624.199 --> 5630.638999999999
killed with vaxis like shut [ __ ] down

5628.36 --> 5631.96
shut police down shut power down like

5630.639 --> 5633.679
they're actively trying trying to

5631.96 --> 5638.92
destroy [ __ ] yeah that shit's not going

5633.679 --> 5638.92
to happen with Trump as Emperor or

5639.8 --> 5646.52
whatever yeah it would be

5643.719 --> 5649.4800000000005
better now you'll never have actual

5646.52 --> 5651.719
Freedom again in all that [ __ ] yeah that

5649.48 --> 5654.759999999999
thing that you barely really have anyway

5651.719 --> 5656.56
or well you can have it if if you accept

5654.76 --> 5657.639
that it's going to be a accompanied with

5656.56 --> 5660.4400000000005
like

5657.639 --> 5662.76
permanent intrusive torture

5660.44 --> 5666.36
psychological torture arure forever

5662.76 --> 5668.639
until you're dead yeah that really is

5666.36 --> 5668.639
that

5672.32 --> 5676.5599999999995
viable yeah because all that freedom is

5674.44 --> 5679.159
never going to lead to you actually

5676.56 --> 5679.159000000001
being left

5681.52 --> 5687.400000000001
alone if you want a world where Freedom

5684.92 --> 5689.92
actually means peace and quiet and being

5687.4 --> 5692.239
left alone then we're going to have to

5689.92 --> 5695.0
hunt down some [ __ ]

5692.239 --> 5698.119
demons there's going to have to be a

5695.0 --> 5701.76
pretty serious depopulation effort of a

5698.119 --> 5703.639
very specific type of population I'm not

5701.76 --> 5709.84
talking about

5703.639 --> 5709.84
race talking about very specific type of

5710.36 --> 5716.88
Behavioral

5712.88 --> 5719.8
stuff mostly psychopath

5716.88 --> 5722.84
category yeah you're going to have to

5719.8 --> 5725.76
really do something about that before

5722.84 --> 5727.119000000001
Freedom will actually mean peace and

5725.76 --> 5730.56
quiet

5727.119 --> 5734.159
again because until they have

5730.56 --> 5736.8
been thoroughly

5734.159 --> 5739.799999999999
removed there is no Peace and Freedom

5736.8 --> 5743.08
because you would just get nagged to all

5739.8 --> 5745.360000000001
hell till you kill yourself or

5743.08 --> 5747.44
Surrender cuz these people are out there

5745.36 --> 5752.239
in the world doing that and they don't

5747.44 --> 5755.199
let go they have all this freedom and

5752.239 --> 5758.959999999999
room and all that on paper it's really

5755.199 --> 5761.759999999999
cute they're going to knag you to kill

5758.96 --> 5765.28
yourself or just bother you in every

5761.76 --> 5765.280000000001
conce that's what they're already

5775.84 --> 5779.679
doing so what are you going to

5780.32 --> 5783.32
do

5805.639 --> 5811.52
right that's right clutch so it's all

5808.92 --> 5814.36
dude this whole Freedom thing is it's

5811.52 --> 5815.639
really an illusion it's just how can we

5814.36 --> 5818.799999999999
make the

5815.639 --> 5821.08
people confident enough to be in the

5818.8 --> 5823.6
illusion that they're

5821.08 --> 5827.32
free on the moments that it really

5823.6 --> 5831.0
matter so that we maintain

5827.32 --> 5831.0
power that's really

5833.08 --> 5839.28
it actual freedom is not sustainable

5836.199 --> 5843.199
that only works when you exterminate all

5839.28 --> 5843.199
people that are actually evil

5843.96 --> 5848.2390000000005
but all people that are actually evil

5846.0 --> 5850.679
are mostly in

5848.239 --> 5854.879999999999
power so that just doesn't work they're

5850.679 --> 5854.88
in power to survive

5855.36 --> 5859.759999999999
arguably it's a self-fulfilling prophecy

5857.84 --> 5862.0
though you have to be in power or or

5859.76 --> 5864.84
you'll not survive but by being in power

5862.0 --> 5867.52
you will have people after you that want

5864.84 --> 5867.52
you to not

5869.28 --> 5874.04
survive but yeah it it it always returns

5872.52 --> 5877.2390000000005
though

5874.04 --> 5880.36
so you know there's really no actual

5877.239 --> 5882.839999999999
freedom without a protector a protector

5880.36 --> 5885.159
would be a lord a lord would be somebody

5882.84 --> 5889.76
that has power over you that you give

5885.159 --> 5892.679
them power so that they protect you in

5889.76 --> 5897.8
trade and that's the only way you can

5892.679 --> 5897.8
have some freedom for real in the real

5900.119 --> 5903.119
world

5917.96 --> 5921.92
yeah crazy isn't it Aries

5925.08 --> 5929.36
106 and it's not by the way it's

5927.28 --> 5932.599
incorrectly formulated it's not the only

5929.36 --> 5935.32
way to have freedom is feudalism

5932.599 --> 5938.52
the only way to have

5935.32 --> 5941.159
peace cuz if you want freedom absolute

5938.52 --> 5944.080000000001
freedom without a lord guess what's

5941.159 --> 5946.36
going to happen endless barrage of

5944.08 --> 5948.48
psychological

5946.36 --> 5952.799999999999
warfare

5948.48 --> 5955.759999999999
bullying uh what do you call that again

5952.8 --> 5957.96
where you cut off resources all

5955.76 --> 5961.52
that

5957.96 --> 5964.52
seees it just never ends it will never

5961.52 --> 5966.320000000001
end until you submit to the Lord and

5964.52 --> 5968.4400000000005
that's just how it works it's not about

5966.32 --> 5971.799999999999
freedom because Freedom right now is

5968.44 --> 5975.199
hell right when demons roam

5971.8 --> 5977.599
around freedom is hell because that

5975.199 --> 5980.759999999999
means freedom for them to do with you

5977.599 --> 5980.76
whatever they [ __ ]

5982.159 --> 5989.08
want right unless you have somebody to

5985.28 --> 5992.199
protect you from that or you are very

5989.08 --> 5993.76
well willing and capable of hunting them

5992.199 --> 5996.759999999999
down

5993.76 --> 5996.76
yourself

5999.96 --> 6005.599
right but most people don't so if you

6003.48 --> 6010.08
don't have a lord to

6005.599 --> 6012.88
basically give you that free space that

6010.08 --> 6014.92
relief that

6012.88 --> 6016.32
peace you're not going to get it you're

6014.92 --> 6019.4800000000005
just going to get barraged by

6016.32 --> 6022.96
psychological warfare and Siege and and

6019.48 --> 6022.959999999999
bullying all the time

6032.119 --> 6038.96
what I'm saying Aries is that freedom

6035.28 --> 6038.96
really isn't feasible

6039.0 --> 6047.719
anymore I want freedom but Freedom only

6043.08 --> 6047.719
works when you kill the

6048.56 --> 6056.119000000001
evil when you remove

6051.76 --> 6057.0
evil from the landscape in order to have

6056.119 --> 6059.96
the

6057.0 --> 6063.159
freedom actually yield some freedom and

6059.96 --> 6063.159
not just a lot of

6072.76 --> 6079.400000000001
burdens J Aries you're not [ __ ] funny

6076.08 --> 6079.4
yeah Nathan is not a

6079.52 --> 6085.84
Lord he's only

6082.32 --> 6088.28
Lord of Flat Earth

6085.84 --> 6090.599
information he's not a Lord he's more

6088.28 --> 6090.599
like a

6092.639 --> 6097.32
knight he's setting a standard with the

6095.199 --> 6100.678999999999
information he's a

6097.32 --> 6103.639
fighter who's the best in that field or

6100.679 --> 6107.28
one of the best arguably the

6103.639 --> 6107.28
best it's not

6109.84 --> 6112.84
Lord

6119.08 --> 6127.5599999999995
D Jason shut the [ __ ] up Jason could you

6123.4 --> 6127.5599999999995
just shut the [ __ ] up for a [ __ ]

6135.08 --> 6142.76
second don't

6137.199 --> 6142.759999999999
[ __ ] recommend your crap series

6143.52 --> 6147.56
and nobody cares about your fellow

6146.239 --> 6150.5599999999995
[ __ ]

6147.56 --> 6150.56
cultists

6153.92 --> 6160.4400000000005
yeah I will kick you out

6157.08 --> 6160.44
Jason stop

6166.49 --> 6169.599999999999
[Music]

6169.76 --> 6172.76
it

6185.36 --> 6189.32
right I'm getting kind of hungry by the

6195.8 --> 6202.679
way going to get some nice baked

6199.08 --> 6202.679
eggs after this

6208.44 --> 6212.96
goody it's raining so I'm definitely not

6210.84 --> 6216.52
collecting that

6212.96 --> 6216.52
monitor anytime

6226.239 --> 6232.0
soon unless I can get like a roommate

6229.679 --> 6234.1990000000005
like

6232.0 --> 6238.0
help me pick it up in a

6234.199 --> 6238.0
car that would be pretty

6251.4 --> 6254.96
sweet right anyway I was like sort of

6254.08 --> 6258.04
talking

6254.96 --> 6260.08
about drum being in the swamp and like

6258.04 --> 6262.199
you're going to have a lord over you

6260.08 --> 6264.199
you're just

6262.199 --> 6265.638999999999
whether you like it or not like oh you

6264.199 --> 6269.0
don't like it well then they're going to

6265.639 --> 6270.96
have a lord over you that is not obvious

6269.0 --> 6276.44
that'll make you

6270.96 --> 6276.44
believe that you're free that's how it

6283.32 --> 6288.199
[Music]

6289.56 --> 6292.56
works

6296.48 --> 6302.44
got to serve somebody right cuz

6298.679 --> 6306.4
otherwise like technically anybody is

6302.44 --> 6308.759999999999
free you're free to do whatever you come

6306.4 --> 6308.759999999999
up

6309.0 --> 6316.76
with and yeah and then you can literally

6312.76 --> 6320.599
do that until somebody stops

6316.76 --> 6324.04
you yeah so technically you are

6320.599 --> 6326.52
technically free to do whatever you can

6324.04 --> 6326.5199999999995
come up

6327.4 --> 6330.4
with

6330.8 --> 6336.599
but if

6333.119 --> 6340.759999999999
it's being disagreed with with some with

6336.599 --> 6343.52
the Lord or the rules of the Lord then

6340.76 --> 6347.2390000000005
somebody's going to stop

6343.52 --> 6352.4800000000005
you might even be organized efforts to

6347.239 --> 6352.48
stop you like the police right

6353.28 --> 6358.639
so technically you're already free and I

6355.199 --> 6360.839999999999
mean anywhere you can be free in Iran

6358.639 --> 6363.679
and do whatever you want but yeah if

6360.84 --> 6365.84
you're going to like have sex on the

6363.679 --> 6368.4400000000005
street they are going to kill you but

6365.84 --> 6370.599
you can literally do that you are free

6368.44 --> 6371.719
to do that but then then you're going to

6370.599 --> 6376.679
pay the

6371.719 --> 6376.679
price right and it's like that

6379.4 --> 6382.4
everywhere

6385.599 --> 6392.2390000000005
cuz freedom is mostly a feeling an

6388.92 --> 6392.2390000000005
idea an

6394.56 --> 6402.88
ideal you don't actually have Pure

6397.76 --> 6405.4800000000005
Freedom but you can still claim it it

6402.88 --> 6405.4800000000005
just has a

6408.4 --> 6414.08
price huh it may be the devil or it may

6411.48 --> 6422.598999999999
be the Lord but you got to serve

6414.08 --> 6422.599
somebody well serve follow like follow

6423.239 --> 6429.159
methods right you got to do something in

6426.28 --> 6432.159
your life and even by doing nothing you

6429.159 --> 6434.598999999999
still do something and by your actions

6432.159 --> 6434.598999999999
and your

6435.36 --> 6441.04
drive you can be categorized as serving

6439.32 --> 6442.199
somebody

6441.04 --> 6445.119
like a

6442.199 --> 6448.239
force force of good force of

6445.119 --> 6454.159
evil or a

6448.239 --> 6454.159
lord a set of rules based on Earthly

6454.44 --> 6460.5599999999995
Authority but you're going to be doing

6456.639 --> 6460.56
something in your life you

6469.32 --> 6472.32

more trollish Aries 106 it's really

6602.8 --> 6605.119000000001
getting

6619.04 --> 6622.04
annoying

6624.0 --> 6628.0
error feedback loop interesting getting

6649.04 --> 6652.04
wisdom

6661.56 --> 6667.09

6708.96 --> 6711.96

6730.47 --> 6733.579000000001
[Music]

6742.199 --> 6745.678999999999
okay I'll keep it like this it's kind of

6744.159 --> 6748.598999999999
rudimentary and

6745.679 --> 6751.88
basic freedom is not free without a lord

6748.599 --> 6753.8
to protect that freedom against evil Me

6751.88 --> 6757.159000000001
From Evil

6753.8 --> 6757.159000000001
against should

6768.159 --> 6773.799999999999
be what do you guys think

6770.56 --> 6775.719
think it does kind of summarize like the

6773.8 --> 6782.04
the point I was trying to

6775.719 --> 6782.04
make why does it say what the oh

6782.84 --> 6788.76
against

6785.679 --> 6792.4
what okay this is

6788.76 --> 6792.400000000001
weird yeah there it

6798.76 --> 6804.079000000001
is no Jason I don't do that sort of

6805.239 --> 6810.28
[ __ ] would be kind of funny to say

6807.599 --> 6813.2390000000005
without a trump to protect that freedom

6810.28 --> 6815.48
against evil that would certainly like

6813.239 --> 6819.759999999999
bring a gigantic load of political

6815.48 --> 6821.759999999999
energy to this title but uh yeah I'm not

6819.76 --> 6825.76
doing

6821.76 --> 6825.76
that hey Rick back good see

6827.679 --> 6835.92
you yeah I'm I'm uh I'm a little

6832.36 --> 6839.44
late I started over an hour late because

6835.92 --> 6843.079
Jason's not having a Jason cuz Nathan is

6839.44 --> 6843.079
not having live

6858.679 --> 6861.679
fed

6862.4 --> 6869.199
look like you missed the show

6864.719 --> 6873.0
yeah oh show has been pretty cool very

6869.199 --> 6873.0
chatty lots of people in chat

6875.56 --> 6881.1990000000005
today just goes to show that I'm really

6878.719 --> 6885.4800000000005
glad that we figured out like how

6881.199 --> 6887.719
to basically Time Out 24 hours because

6885.48 --> 6889.799999999999
yesterday's show it's just the chat

6887.719 --> 6891.8
really froze because it was just getting

6889.8 --> 6895.52
spammed with

6891.8 --> 6895.52
like with ban

6895.76 --> 6900.52
messages and that does make people shut

6898.52 --> 6902.280000000001
up it really does that it's very

6900.52 --> 6904.159000000001
disruptive so I'm really glad that we

6902.28 --> 6908.199
only have to do that once

6904.159 --> 6911.4
now cuz now people actually get

6908.199 --> 6913.5199999999995
chatty which is great it's exactly what

6911.4 --> 6913.5199999999995
I

6918.599 --> 6921.599
want

6948.599 --> 6952.92
for

6951.239 --> 6957.119
right I could also change the title in

6952.92 --> 6960.84
like freedom is not free while evil

6957.119 --> 6963.28
exists but in that case that would show

6960.84 --> 6966.76
like an entirely different

6963.28 --> 6969.119
Paradigm namely that freedom is not

6966.76 --> 6971.119000000001
technically achievable because evil

6969.119 --> 6974.44
always

6971.119 --> 6977.88
exists it always

6974.44 --> 6980.159
returns in that sense freedom is

6977.88 --> 6982.2390000000005
shortlived naturally

6980.159 --> 6984.839999999999
right in the moment where evil is

6982.239 --> 6987.32
defeated and destroyed where it all

6984.84 --> 6991.4400000000005
flees and pretends not to be evil tries

6987.32 --> 6994.799999999999
to be a good boy and then eventually

6991.44 --> 6997.0
they get that impulse again and then

6994.8 --> 7000.28
they come out of the shadows and start

6997.0 --> 7002.36
to corrupt things again right so freedom

7000.28 --> 7006.679
is always like

7002.36 --> 7006.679
shortlived because evil always

7008.48 --> 7011.48
returns

7023.599 --> 7030.04
but yeah the this title right now fits

7027.88 --> 7031.639
the message that I was trying to explain

7030.04 --> 7035.639
earlier a bit

7031.639 --> 7035.639
better so I'm going to stick with

7038.4 --> 7041.4
that

7044.599 --> 7048.32
right and the funny thing is that you

7046.0 --> 7052.04
could even like see it spiritually as

7048.32 --> 7054.48
well cuz a lord who says that has to be

7052.04 --> 7057.8
an actual human being with a

7054.48 --> 7061.4
function it could be the Lord it could

7057.8 --> 7065.360000000001
be Christ

7061.4 --> 7068.199
Spirit could be your personal spiritual

7065.36 --> 7070.159
Lord that protect

7068.199 --> 7073.4
you right

7070.159 --> 7076.48
so you could interpret it in literal and

7073.4 --> 7076.48
in esoteric

7077.4 --> 7082.92
ways and I like that I like multiple

7098.32 --> 7101.32
options

7101.84 --> 7108.639
I could also replace the word evil with

7105.92 --> 7111.1990000000005
corruption might even work better what

7108.639 --> 7111.1990000000005
do you guys

7122.56 --> 7128.320000000001
think yeah I think I'm going to change

7125.639 --> 7131.2390000000005
it to corruption it's even

7128.32 --> 7133.719
better Evil's a bit

7131.239 --> 7136.079
generic oh I don't know if it's going to

7133.719 --> 7136.079
fit

7138.36 --> 7141.53
[Music]

7143.4 --> 7147.598999999999
though no it doesn't freaking

7155.96 --> 7162.84
fit no it literally I can't it has to be

7159.4 --> 7162.839999999999
but they can't make it fit this is

7163.76 --> 7169.679
crazy so it's going to be evil then

7166.639 --> 7173.96
corruption and evil though are pretty

7169.679 --> 7173.96
synonymous corruption is never

7179.0 --> 7184.88
good can't delete what do you mean can't

7188.239 --> 7191.239
delete

7191.92 --> 7197.28
to protect oh yeah that's a good point

7194.92 --> 7198.88
bers boy yeah you're right actually I

7197.28 --> 7202.119
could remove

7198.88 --> 7202.119
that of

7204.8 --> 7210.400000000001
that yeah that actually fits

7207.96 --> 7214.52
perfectly freedom is not free without a

7210.4 --> 7214.5199999999995
lore to protect Freedom against

7214.599 --> 7221.159000000001
corruption although it does make it

7216.84 --> 7221.159000000001
sound now it's more ASO

7222.079 --> 7226.44
cuz it's now Freedom the General Freedom

7225.52 --> 7231.040000000001
being

7226.44 --> 7234.28
protected well a legal Lord can't like

7231.04 --> 7234.28
protect General

7235.079 --> 7241.4
Freedom but yeah fine it I do like it

7248.119 --> 7251.119
though

7253.92 --> 7257.8
no I'm not going to change it break

7269.679 --> 7276.679
back although it is more fluid you got a

7272.8 --> 7281.04
point there maybe I will change it to

7276.679 --> 7281.04
it yeah right

7287.199 --> 7291.799999999999
or it's corruption it's even

7293.04 --> 7299.88
better cuz Freedom can corrupt itself

7296.52 --> 7299.88
right Freedom can become

7302.56 --> 7308.04
evil to protect against its

7306.37 --> 7311.04
[Music]

7308.04 --> 7311.04
corruption

7316.56 --> 7321.8
ha protect it against its

7322.719 --> 7327.88
corruption that's unexpected twist of a

7337.96 --> 7341.76
title

7340.119 --> 7343.5199999999995
if you don't trust the Lord to protect

7341.76 --> 7345.8
your freedom from corruption well then

7343.52 --> 7350.320000000001
you don't understand anything about

7345.8 --> 7353.320000000001
those words Aries 106 which is very

7350.32 --> 7356.0
fitting yeah cuz your freedom can

7353.32 --> 7358.88
corrupt yeah you be the one that will

7356.0 --> 7364.079
corrupt it if there's a Lord that

7358.88 --> 7366.56
prevents you from corrupting your own

7364.079 --> 7369.84
Freedom well then you're protected

7366.56 --> 7371.96
against the corruption by them yeah the

7369.84 --> 7375.159000000001
rules the

7371.96 --> 7378.4

7375.159 --> 7380.799999999999
you against the corruption of your

7378.4 --> 7382.719
freedom cuz if the law wasn't there to

7380.8 --> 7384.1990000000005
