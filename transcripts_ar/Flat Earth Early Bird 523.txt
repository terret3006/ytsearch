[Music]

29.77 --> 31.83

good morning welcome to flatter the

42.19 --> 47.5
earlybird number 523 I'm your host

45.46 --> 49.15
Arwen and before we start to show please

47.5 --> 51.1
don't forget to share it on any platform

49.15 --> 52.839999999999996
you deem fit and if you haven't already

51.1 --> 54.46
subscribed to my channel and hit the

52.84 --> 56.35
bell notification so you know when I'm

54.46 --> 57.910000000000004
going live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

56.35 --> 60.67
and so damn time every day

57.91 --> 62.65
please also do support me so the paypal

60.67 --> 64.93
patreon my GoFundMe the super chat and

62.65 --> 69.51
the membership system that would be much

64.93 --> 74.38000000000001
appreciated yeah I finally got it and

69.51 --> 76.51
yeah I already got three members now duh

74.38 --> 78.22
it's kind of hard to read though like

76.51 --> 80.14
the letters are blue over green so

78.22 --> 83.25
anyway dank was the first become a

80.14 --> 89.32
member and then of course Amanda you

83.25 --> 93.88
proceeded not too long after and an uber

89.32 --> 95.66999999999999
mukou right so thank you guys and then

93.88 --> 100.06
ya dank even became an arcane Archer

95.67 --> 103.5
it's pretty cool so yeah I had still

100.06 --> 107.5
working out the details you can actually

103.5 --> 111.25
edit it afterwards but after yeah I

107.5 --> 114.13
basically filled in a basic thing for it

111.25 --> 116.8
so it would be sort of consistent at

114.13 --> 121.11999999999999
least like building up the tiers and all

116.8 --> 123.42999999999999
that and but yeah it still will work in

121.12 --> 127.78
progress but it's there so you can now

123.43 --> 130.989
join and become a member and yeah

127.78 --> 134.739
especially at arcane Archer level enough

130.989 --> 136.33
I basically have pledged in my mind I

134.739 --> 141.19
don't know exactly when that I'll do

136.33 --> 145.269
like yeah special unique member only

141.19 --> 148.209
broadcasts in which I will probably talk

145.269 --> 152.32
to another level that I would normally

148.209 --> 153.64000000000001
not yea do in public like that but I

152.32 --> 157.18
don't know exactly

153.64 --> 159.97
yeah when but that's like an idea that

157.18 --> 161.56
I've had so I'm gonna have to start

159.97 --> 164.34
paying taxes well misery bear

161.56 --> 166.94
practically I am already paying taxes

164.34 --> 169.76
yeah membership

166.94 --> 173.45
it goes directly to Google pretty much

169.76 --> 176.78
just like super chats but yeah it's

173.45 --> 179.20999999999998
there I should utilize it and yeah I

176.78 --> 181.58
also want the Google situation to grow

179.21 --> 183.68
and I have remember I've like other

181.58 --> 185.75
things going on as well GTI in the

183.68 --> 188.57
background the cryptocurrency situations

185.75 --> 191.66
I've been on with my dad for like years

188.57 --> 195.04999999999998
now and it's going good it's like almost

191.66 --> 198.82999999999998
fulfilled like very close and then it's

195.05 --> 200.63000000000002
just like surplus stuff and yeah

198.83 --> 204.58
figuring out like how to deal with it

200.63 --> 208.46
because it is freaking complex to me but

204.58 --> 212.0
so yeah you know the membership system

208.46 --> 216.92000000000002
became available I wanted to initiate it

212.0 --> 220.88
I had oh hey good servant thank you for

216.92 --> 224.69
becoming a ranger as well yeah

220.88 --> 227.68
technically my members are all elfs but

224.69 --> 230.78
I don't yet I don't know how that works

227.68 --> 232.73000000000002
but that's yeah that's I guess the

230.78 --> 235.79
member classification that I'm

232.73 --> 241.76
designated in designated the memberships

235.79 --> 245.12
as so that yeah all the Ranger typical

241.76 --> 250.7
elf arcane Archer is exclusively elf a

245.12 --> 254.27
seer is also like an elf and of course

250.7 --> 257.32
the arch to it can be nothing else but

254.27 --> 257.32
an alpha

258.169 --> 268.139
so yeah that's that so finally I got it

265.61 --> 273.35
let's proceed with the rest of the show

268.139 --> 276.24
the noise outside they're ramming in

273.35 --> 279.36
giant steel pylons into the ground again

276.24 --> 284.46000000000004
I think anyway yeah the weather is kind

279.36 --> 290.49
of same as yesterday maybe even more

284.46 --> 294.29999999999995
rainy so but yeah

290.49 --> 296.82
plants are appreciating it I do have to

294.3 --> 298.16900000000004
do my newspaper round a little bit later

296.82 --> 301.949
I hope it's not going to be in the

298.169 --> 304.71
middle of a storm but yeah I don't care

301.949 --> 306.87
I've been through worse the whole point

304.71 --> 309.12
about it is that I do it no matter what

306.87 --> 316.65
pretty much unless I'm like extremely

309.12 --> 327.139
sick and I'm not right so yeah I got a

316.65 --> 329.729
green tea with me man yeah I had a

327.139 --> 332.61
interesting day yesterday ended up with

329.729 --> 334.139
a Skype conversation or rather I don't

332.61 --> 335.37
know I was not much of a

334.139 --> 337.789
conversationalist because it was

335.37 --> 343.47
extremely late rhasta had called me up

337.789 --> 347.58
and like talked supplements again and

343.47 --> 355.73
and yeah I kind of convinced me to place

347.58 --> 359.52
an order at a like a a very good tobacco

355.73 --> 361.44
distributor as an alternative to the

359.52 --> 365.54999999999995
standard tobacco that I'm buying now

361.44 --> 367.95
which yeah is giving me some problems

365.55 --> 370.47
next to not having an air filter here we

367.95 --> 372.57
also discussed the air filter in great

370.47 --> 375.39000000000004
depth because freaking Rasta hot you

372.57 --> 378.27
know it's like it's almost annoying how

375.39 --> 380.64
well research that guy is in some things

378.27 --> 384.59999999999997
it's like makes me feel a little bit

380.64 --> 389.78999999999996
embarrassed about myself but then again

384.6 --> 391.32000000000005
he is Rasta hat anyway he kind of

389.79 --> 395.09000000000003
halfway convinced me that I should

391.32 --> 397.77
probably go for for an Alexa pure system

395.09 --> 400.56
because he yeah he's had experience with

397.77 --> 405.0
it for years explain to me how it worked

400.56 --> 410.4
compared it and I think I should

405.0 --> 412.59
probably take it like because with money

410.4 --> 415.169
situations coming up the way I'm doing

412.59 --> 417.81
right now yeah there is a big chance

415.169 --> 420.22999999999996
that I will buy it no matter what but in

417.81 --> 423.3
this case if I do that then I have some

420.23 --> 424.85
potential spare room for other things as

423.3 --> 428.13
well

424.85 --> 431.37
many supplements but anyway I ordered

428.13 --> 434.04
some tobacco leaves actually a huge

431.37 --> 436.95
amount now I am gonna have to like work

434.04 --> 440.34000000000003
on them myself because it is yeah almost

436.95 --> 441.93
raw it's a hot raw whole leaf it's going

440.34 --> 444.86999999999995
to be quite an experience and it's going

441.93 --> 449.43
to be much better than the tobacco I've

444.87 --> 453.65
been using and I hope it'll have much

449.43 --> 453.65000000000003
more of the medicinal aspects

455.41 --> 466.76000000000005
so yeah and effectively like the amount

463.729 --> 471.90999999999997
of tobacco's I'm getting which is second

466.76 --> 475.9
two pounds it's a huge amount right and

471.91 --> 478.88000000000005
effectively the the amounted cost is

475.9 --> 483.56
technically cheaper as if I would be

478.88 --> 485.87
just buying standard packages of this so

483.56 --> 488.78000000000003
yeah I'm very curious to try this out

485.87 --> 490.31
it's kind of excited because even my

488.78 --> 492.38
mind--a I had been wanting to do that

490.31 --> 497.11
for a long time raster brought that up

492.38 --> 497.11
like a year ago and he's been using that

498.07 --> 505.49
anyway what that's every use doc I don't

501.86 --> 509.22900000000004
know what that is creation bear let's go

505.49 --> 513.26
through chat sorry taking so long

509.229 --> 517.9
right effectively dank becoming a member

513.26 --> 523.789
was first Jim Jones Amanda young

Oh yuck no question question it

594.68 --> 603.0
definitely and don't not gonna chew

598.14 --> 609.09
tobacco this that's like a complete

603.0 --> 613.4
nightmare for your teeth I'm not gonna

609.09 --> 613.4
do that absolutely not

614.6 --> 619.46
can I post my new video page and servant

618.03 --> 622.3
today oh yeah sure

619.46 --> 625.45
chair pose link

622.3 --> 625.4499999999999
[Music]

636.92 --> 644.87
first avatar for the membership yeah the

639.649 --> 647.72
icon is it's a shield if you yeah it's

644.87 --> 649.76
it used to be a bigger picture but it's

647.72 --> 652.339
basically the arranger icon now the

649.76 --> 658.1899999999999
weird thing is for some reason it always

652.339 --> 660.3800000000001
chooses that and I couldn't set the type

658.19 --> 663.49
of membership system directly with

660.38 --> 667.76
another type of icon I don't know why

663.49 --> 670.97
but it would only let the icons progress

667.76 --> 676.16
over time for some reason I have no idea

670.97 --> 684.7090000000001
why it is like that but yeah that's how

676.16 --> 689.35
it works apparently 4 inches long right

684.709 --> 689.3499999999999
all these leaves are like this is big

691.12 --> 698.279
it's good stuff maybe I can show that

694.38 --> 698.279
it's got a history

710.78 --> 713.78
right

718.54 --> 727.329
yeah I can present that to show you I'm

725.47 --> 730.089
I'm looking forward to this stuff

727.329 --> 734.019
because I know this is gonna be so much

730.089 --> 736.589
better than anything I've ever tried

734.019 --> 736.589
before this

756.56 --> 771.9799999999999
okay this is getting weird

760.01 --> 777.77
oh right of course all right so this is

771.98 --> 779.0500000000001
the stuff salsa from this company so

777.77 --> 785.23
it's pretty sweet

779.05 --> 785.2299999999999
let's see if I can yeah check it out

798.02 --> 803.91
[Music]

799.92 --> 807.42
so yeah looking forward to to getting

803.91 --> 809.4889999999999
that in the mail and then yeah Rasta

807.42 --> 811.29
gave me some tips on how to work on it

809.489 --> 814.619
apparently he's done a lot of research

811.29 --> 817.1089999999999
when he got into his own like stepping

814.619 --> 819.419
away from standard prefab tobacco's and

817.109 --> 822.1790000000001
making it yourself and he figured out

819.419 --> 826.169
all kinds of crazy - back in his tips

822.179 --> 827.4889999999999
like it's it's freaking rest I had you

826.169 --> 829.679
know he already knows pretty much

827.489 --> 831.899
everything about cannabis but apparently

829.679 --> 833.639
now he knows everything about tobacco's

831.899 --> 838.529
as well and even he could technically

833.639 --> 841.369
make it himself now we yeah the guy has

838.529 --> 848.1
so much energy for his kind of stuff

841.369 --> 854.089
it's very inspiring like a man because

848.1 --> 857.0690000000001
he does have so many good ideas anyway

854.089 --> 860.0690000000001
dad yeah any supplements he's like

857.069 --> 862.9799999999999
trying out all kinds of pretty advanced

860.069 --> 867.569
supplements with like remarkable results

862.98 --> 869.79
and it's fascinating and like I'm

867.569 --> 872.9989999999999
willing to try some of that out but all

869.79 --> 876.54
those things are like costly and yeah

872.999 --> 879.4490000000001
and you can't just I'll try that out all

876.54 --> 883.439
at once if you don't have like huge

879.449 --> 885.179
incomes or something and I don't not

883.439 --> 888.059
that is even that expensive but just

885.179 --> 890.97
kind of for tech did for now it's a

888.059 --> 897.7199999999999
tobacco's it's like my new project I

890.97 --> 899.639
guess and natural supplements well they

897.72 --> 903.119
were like some of them were like by a

899.639 --> 908.699
lab mate but it is technically natural

903.119 --> 910.999
stuff I think I don't remember like that

908.699 --> 914.809
on the top of that of my head like which

910.999 --> 914.809
what it exactly was

921.55 --> 925.31
and

923.15 --> 929.59
all right oh yeah he also talked about

925.31 --> 932.8399999999999
what's very interesting yeah like

929.59 --> 935.51
another type of antidepressant that's

932.84 --> 937.61
like exactly the opposite of what we all

935.51 --> 941.63
know is so [ __ ] dangerous they are

937.61 --> 945.85
SSRIs right and I had a whole story

941.63 --> 948.89
about that and apparently there is a

945.85 --> 952.4
substance that does exactly kind of the

948.89 --> 956.89
opposite and instead of like preventing

952.4 --> 959.65
your cells from up taping serotonin

956.89 --> 962.15
right which is what serotonin reuptake

959.65 --> 964.1
inhibitors do like they prevent it

962.15 --> 965.63
there's the substance that does exactly

964.1 --> 968.63
the opposite and actually makes your

965.63 --> 972.32
body absorb it more easily and utilize

968.63 --> 974.78
it apparently and it's remarkable at

972.32 --> 977.36
least that's what rasta said that like

974.78 --> 981.38
some people overuse it incredibly but it

977.36 --> 984.2
apparently isn't even that dangerous so

981.38 --> 989.03
it's almost like a weird type of

984.2 --> 990.8900000000001
pharmaceutical bio thingy that like

989.03 --> 993.89
almost like cannabis you can take

990.89 --> 999.89
excessively without too much yeah it's

993.89 --> 1003.43
like yeah like the body was almost like

999.89 --> 1006.46
it's very flexible in using it so it's

1003.43 --> 1008.38
fascinating what is out there what has

1006.46 --> 1011.95
been discovered and what's been figured

1008.38 --> 1013.66
out and being used I'm very curious to

1011.95 --> 1016.99
try some of these things because the at

1013.66 --> 1018.79
rest has been like physically see like

1016.99 --> 1021.13
I've been keeping track he's like

1018.79 --> 1026.44
physically transformed like to

1021.13 --> 1029.82
incredible levels it's like yeah if you

1026.44 --> 1032.41
seen him like two years ago and then

1029.82 --> 1034.3
didn't pay attention then see what he

1032.41 --> 1036.24
looks now you'd almost be like what is

1034.3 --> 1040.6299999999999
this like his twin brother or something

1036.24 --> 1043.48
because he's like his arms are like

1040.63 --> 1047.47
twice the size now and just his skin is

1043.48 --> 1050.929
all improved up and vivid hair growth

1047.47 --> 1057.289
and it's like a different guy

1050.929 --> 1061.19
it's pretty remarkable but he's worked

1057.289 --> 1066.289
on it an incredible about almost

1061.19 --> 1069.679
obsessively could say oh right and also

1066.289 --> 1073.399
was funny little factoid like remember

1069.679 --> 1077.1190000000001
the the very controversial but great

1073.399 --> 1079.9399999999998
video of those two doctors in the

1077.119 --> 1083.57
hospital in the US right that did that

1079.94 --> 1086.48
very long question-and-answer situation

1083.57 --> 1089.99
that when all over the internet that

1086.48 --> 1092.929
basically said like how things are have

1089.99 --> 1096.799
been miss appointed and just very clear

1092.929 --> 1100.3690000000001
picture and honest references on how to

1096.799 --> 1103.1589999999999
deal with it it's just incredible video

1100.369 --> 1106.1
well apparently like he almost knows

1103.159 --> 1108.409
those doctors like when he saw that it

1106.1 --> 1112.58
was like hey I know that's in the

1108.409 --> 1116.929
hospital my mother goes do it's a few

1112.58 --> 1121.519
miles that way so that was interesting

1116.929 --> 1124.94
little thing to tell ya by the way that

1121.519 --> 1127.249
video of course has now been is like uh

1124.94 --> 1131.48
Nate on the banned list because it's

1127.249 --> 1133.97
like too good I don't know I didn't have

1131.48 --> 1135.47
too much trouble picking up on it when

1133.97 --> 1137.84
it was already being said it was gonna

1135.47 --> 1139.73
be banned everywhere so I did download

1137.84 --> 1144.58
it to my computer if ever anybody ever

1139.73 --> 1144.58
needs that video I have it

1148.73 --> 1153.669
could potentially email it to you or

1151.16 --> 1153.669
something like that

1162.179 --> 1164.8400000000001
but

1168.21 --> 1174.52
Missouri bear what every hospital has a

1171.37 --> 1181.059
guy in the back holding the knife what

1174.52 --> 1196.99
what does that mean do you mean like

1181.059 --> 1201.85
surgeons sounds kind of nefarious right

1196.99 --> 1205.299
yeah also I've been subscribed since

1201.85 --> 1208.6899999999998
like yesterday to this e Michael Jones

1205.299 --> 1210.94
guy it was on Owen Benjamin and I've

1208.69 --> 1214.54
seen him before he's been alone Benjamin

1210.94 --> 1219.5800000000002
before and I've seen him around for a

1214.54 --> 1225.61
while but he is pretty astonishing what

1219.58 --> 1227.23
he knows like the detail and like it's a

1225.61 --> 1232.8899999999999
fascinating guy so I watched some of

1227.23 --> 1236.549
that like he basically got into how

1232.89 --> 1239.95
certain type of cinema icons were

1236.549 --> 1242.29
created in response to certain type of

1239.95 --> 1249.16
scenarios almost like political

1242.29 --> 1251.62
situations and like response to national

1249.16 --> 1256.3300000000002
trauma and how that were fascinating it

1251.62 --> 1258.25
was extremely fascinating so yeah

1256.33 --> 1260.4399999999998
Michael Jones I'm subscribed to his

1258.25 --> 1262.9
channel I don't know if you know about

1260.44 --> 1266.46
him dee dee has just been yeah he has

1262.9 --> 1266.46
also been on Alex Jones that's right

1267.84 --> 1272.1899999999998
right so I've been watching some bad

1273.65 --> 1278.799
[Music]

1275.549 --> 1286.4189999999999
also cut some Owen Benjamin was very

1278.799 --> 1288.519
late though and yeah I don't remember

1286.419 --> 1289.3890000000001
anything any of it the horror movie

1288.519 --> 1291.789
right yes

1289.389 --> 1293.74
Missouri bear so I guess you've seen

1291.789 --> 1295.69
that that Vidya - it was really

1293.74 --> 1299.169
fascinating it's very likely there's a

1295.69 --> 1300.6390000000001
lot of bears that watch on Benjamin have

1299.169 --> 1304.96
probably seen that video because it was

1300.639 --> 1307.799
like the latest video on his channel it

1304.96 --> 1307.799
was really good

1323.73 --> 1328.2
yes yeah Robin Stanley you know why I

1326.37 --> 1332.07
personally think it's so intriguing

1328.2 --> 1335.789
because in a way I try to do the same

1332.07 --> 1338.1589999999999
thing except I do it more from the

1335.789 --> 1340.679
perspective of slightly more

1338.159 --> 1342.659
oversimplified by continually working on

1340.679 --> 1345.45
condensing it more and more as a game

1342.659 --> 1347.88
master as a world builder type of

1345.45 --> 1350.6390000000001
perspective which I practically do and

1347.88 --> 1353.7890000000002
that's how I then try to explain like

1350.639 --> 1358.309
with purpose and all that and he really

1353.789 --> 1361.11
does the same thing except more research

1358.309 --> 1363.72
into historical thinking it's it's yeah

1361.11 --> 1368.01
it makes me feel a little bit ashamed

1363.72 --> 1370.409
like wow but then again the guy is he's

1368.01 --> 1372.51
been around for a while so technically

1370.409 --> 1374.88
maybe like in 30 years if I am still

1372.51 --> 1379.11
around I might reach that kind of level

1374.88 --> 1381.3890000000001
as well who knows you know but it's

1379.11 --> 1386.1589999999999
incredible how he puts things down and

1381.389 --> 1388.649
he it really feels like like that's

1386.159 --> 1391.2890000000002
that's how I would say that's

1388.649 --> 1404.039
like--that's points that I'm trying to

1391.289 --> 1406.169
make so it's yeah it was good and I like

1404.039 --> 1409.889
his sense of balance always that you

1406.169 --> 1412.44
always which something that I do no

1409.889 --> 1415.559
matter the figure that you're observing

1412.44 --> 1418.6490000000001
or analyzing like they're always a

1415.559 --> 1422.7
person and they may be like evil or

1418.649 --> 1424.86
caught and but that even still means

1422.7 --> 1427.1390000000001
there's still a person and they have

1424.86 --> 1431.35
workings and things that drive them and

1427.139 --> 1433.01
he just understands this so well and I

1431.35 --> 1435.6589999999999
[Music]

1433.01 --> 1437.76
guess for a person like me it's it's a

1435.659 --> 1440.419
relief to see somebody like that having

1437.76 --> 1440.419
a good conversation

1443.149 --> 1449.4289999999999
why can't everyone see the truth Arwen

1445.95 --> 1454.8500000000001
well because it's difficult to do that

1449.429 --> 1460.049
and takes lifelong dedications and

1454.85 --> 1462.1789999999999
sacrifices and most people just can't do

1460.049 --> 1465.1689999999999
it or they they don't want to do it they

1462.179 --> 1467.3400000000001
don't they're not encouraged to do it

1465.169 --> 1469.98
you know when you're a little kid and

1467.34 --> 1472.3799999999999
you're confronted with the insanity and

1469.98 --> 1475.08
the seductions of the world and like

1472.38 --> 1477.0
evil is even showing to you like yeah

1475.08 --> 1478.86
the world is evil what you got to do now

1477.0 --> 1480.919
and then they go to their parents and

1478.86 --> 1485.809
their parents don't even understand it

1480.919 --> 1488.1490000000001
that's a risk you know that's that's

1485.809 --> 1490.74
unpredictable what can happen and

1488.149 --> 1492.779
unfortunately yeah if you're in that

1490.74 --> 1494.97
situation it's really that bad then

1492.779 --> 1497.779
there's a lot of kids that even though

1494.97 --> 1502.1000000000001
they had a lot of power they will

1497.779 --> 1504.57
effectively be from a place of despair

1502.1 --> 1510.289
become like Darth Vader and choose the

1504.57 --> 1514.649
darkside you know that's the unfortunate

1510.289 --> 1520.559
consequence of having a family but not

1514.649 --> 1521.34
really being responsible not not being a

1520.559 --> 1523.47
warrior

1521.34 --> 1528.62
to defend your family against the

1523.47 --> 1528.6200000000001
insanity of the world in the right way

1536.73 --> 1542.88
and yeah I've been through that in like

1540.929 --> 1547.5900000000001
a half half situations because my

1542.88 --> 1551.6100000000001
parents were kind of smart enough but

1547.59 --> 1557.85
they also were just kind of like yeah

1551.61 --> 1561.7199999999998
liberal and derailed so when I really

1557.85 --> 1563.52
tried to peek my way through it being a

1561.72 --> 1566.01
youngster still thinking that I could

1563.52 --> 1566.75
make it like just like that in that

1566.01 --> 1570.299
setting

1566.75 --> 1571.74
they eventually kind of like didn't

1570.299 --> 1573.96
really know what to do with it anymore

1571.74 --> 1576.0
and they were getting afraid of like the

1573.96 --> 1580.46
challenges that I was willing to take on

1576.0 --> 1580.46
because they they were afraid of that

1581.51 --> 1586.2
they were afraid of like bad attention

1584.01 --> 1591.0
and of course yeah my mother is into the

1586.2 --> 1597.54
music as a teacher and she loved it so

1591.0 --> 1599.97
much so then you know who's among that

1597.54 --> 1602.04
group and what typically the

1599.97 --> 1604.71
consequences can be if you're Lucy

1602.04 --> 1606.87
seeking greatness and my mother was

1604.71 --> 1612.51
seduced to that up to a certain degree

1606.87 --> 1614.9699999999998
and some crazy situations kind of

1612.51 --> 1618.299
arrived from that as I look very

1614.97 --> 1624.39
slightly hinted towards because I just

1618.299 --> 1628.25
not something that so they were

1624.39 --> 1632.91
basically damaged and could not be

1628.25 --> 1636.75
champion parents to me in my adolescent

1632.91 --> 1642.26
age and that kind of made me lost and

1636.75 --> 1650.01
then like slide off into a disparate

1642.26 --> 1656.49
worldview and right that pacified me

1650.01 --> 1659.49
that made me retract and not engage like

1656.49 --> 1662.48
with just open confidence like just I

1659.49 --> 1665.82
did there was a barrier in between now

1662.48 --> 1666.419
like I didn't see the logos in the world

1665.82 --> 1669.99
anymore

1666.419 --> 1670.5900000000001
I couldn't understand like how all these

1669.99 --> 1675.09
people

1670.59 --> 1676.8799999999999
do all that and not just suffer under is

1675.09 --> 1679.6499999999999
it yeah

1676.88 --> 1682.14
so in a way I was like almost in a

1679.65 --> 1685.47
reversed world scenario but of my own

1682.14 --> 1687.9
making not tied into the madness of the

1685.47 --> 1689.669
beast because other people have that too

1687.9 --> 1694.65
and they get tied into the madness of

1689.669 --> 1697.2
the beast I that wouldn't happen it that

1694.65 --> 1707.3090000000002
feels inferior even from a state of

1697.2 --> 1711.929
despair for me yeah but yeah I grew out

1707.309 --> 1716.549
of it I always just trust it like no as

1711.929 --> 1722.0700000000002
long as I just don't let my mind wander

1716.549 --> 1725.82
off too far and like like let my

1722.07 --> 1729.539
character slip into complete madness as

1725.82 --> 1732.27
long as I keep that tight keep that like

1729.539 --> 1734.85
a cage almost even though I didn't want

1732.27 --> 1736.559
to do it right and I felt lost so it's

1734.85 --> 1739.83
like yeah I have to write it to

1736.559 --> 1742.83
completely derail it's like the ego

1739.83 --> 1745.47
tries to fight to take you down and I

1742.83 --> 1748.74
just know I got this cage and I'm never

1745.47 --> 1752.64
touching and mentally never considering

1748.74 --> 1755.52
letting it buckle like no I'm keeping

1752.64 --> 1757.89
that freakin cage polished baby that's

1755.52 --> 1760.3799999999999
never nothing and like I could be

1757.89 --> 1762.2990000000002
physically tortured or mutilated in my

1760.38 --> 1766.8600000000001
mind and I would never let that cage

1762.299 --> 1769.559
crumble like that and also that effect

1766.86 --> 1774.2099999999998
carried me through some crazy dark world

1769.559 --> 1776.549
visions and allowed me to maintain the

1774.21 --> 1782.49
flame of Honor through just absolute

1776.549 --> 1785.6689999999999
darkness because the cage was now

1782.49 --> 1787.94
protecting it from the darkness in a way

1785.669 --> 1794.669
it's not

1787.94 --> 1798.21
yeah but yeah to never completely let it

1794.669 --> 1801.0800000000002
slip and now that cage is is like my

1798.21 --> 1805.2
personality my being has pretty much

1801.08 --> 1805.799
like a tree being obstructed by an

1805.2 --> 1810.059
object

1805.799 --> 1816.21
I've grown around it and just my my

1810.059 --> 1819.36
structure has formed in in symmetry with

1816.21 --> 1822.8400000000001
the mechanism of keeping myself together

1819.36 --> 1825.75
in that cage and so now it's become

1822.84 --> 1832.649
almost impossible that has effectively

1825.75 --> 1835.82
become impossible for me to to let the

1832.649 --> 1839.01
light out because the cage has basically

1835.82 --> 1843.4189999999999
integrated with my my very fabric and

1839.01 --> 1846.48
purpose so yeah it that was probably the

1843.419 --> 1849.8300000000002
best sub conscious subconscious

1846.48 --> 1852.299
absolutely decision that I've ever made

1849.83 --> 1856.11
because now it's getting somewhere I

1852.299 --> 1858.809
feel like yes I have this I'm like a

1856.11 --> 1861.9189999999999
tree and I have this weird cage with the

1858.809 --> 1865.02
lantern inside it's very mystical thing

1861.919 --> 1867.8990000000001
spiritually and I don't know maybe some

1865.02 --> 1871.1399999999999
point yeah I will be too big and then

1867.899 --> 1874.529
some freaking grab her out there will

1871.14 --> 1877.3200000000002
decide to cut me down and I don't know I

1874.529 --> 1879.929
hope there will be other people to try

1877.32 --> 1881.97
and prevent that from happening but I am

1879.929 --> 1884.909
a tree you know so it's not like I'm

1881.97 --> 1886.6490000000001
really going somewhere like I have to be

1884.909 --> 1891.21
in this frequency I have to be like this

1886.649 --> 1893.76
I can I can play around but my roots are

1891.21 --> 1897.72
always here in this frequency that's

1893.76 --> 1900.87
that's how it must be it's the only

1897.72 --> 1903.419
viable course of action for me to have a

1900.87 --> 1904.9799999999998
more purposeful long-term life for

1903.419 --> 1908.179
however long it'll last

1904.98 --> 1908.179
I must

1914.259 --> 1918.859
and that is what I'm gonna be doing with

1918.139 --> 1924.6789999999999
my life

1918.859 --> 1927.139
as much as I can I hope and I hope that

1924.679 --> 1932.8990000000001
with these strong roots in the and the

1927.139 --> 1936.1689999999999
light integrated into my very structure

1932.899 --> 1944.9789999999998
that my branches may reach extremely far

1936.169 --> 1947.8990000000001
so that I'm not effectively trapped see

1944.979 --> 1950.3890000000001
because that is that's almost like that

1947.899 --> 1952.279
the the mistaking trick it's a trick I

1950.389 --> 1956.269
fell for at first it's like yeah you're

1952.279 --> 1960.649
a seedling but yeah what spot are you

1956.269 --> 1963.559
gonna choose to to settle the rest of

1960.649 --> 1968.389
your life to have your roots until you

1963.559 --> 1970.849
die you know and as a seedling if you

1968.389 --> 1973.7289999999998
already kind of start to get aware of

1970.849 --> 1976.279
like what you are and your future now

1973.729 --> 1977.96
that for a normal seedling I like doubt

1976.279 --> 1979.609
that'll happen or who knows you know

1977.96 --> 1982.849
that you we don't understand the

1979.609 --> 1986.149
mystical depths of of consciousness of

1982.849 --> 1989.09
other beings we can only go by what we

1986.149 --> 1991.9699999999998
can deduce from what's happening really

1989.09 --> 1994.399
and what we can sense from it and how it

1991.97 --> 1996.259
changes in response to what we do so we

1994.399 --> 1999.0189999999998
don't understand the full nature of the

1996.259 --> 2001.539
consciousness of any living thing but

1999.019 --> 2004.479
just metaphorically as a seedling goes

2001.539 --> 2006.729
down I have like no I don't want to this

2004.479 --> 2008.679
is not a good spot for me to to settle

2006.729 --> 2010.8990000000001
down because looking over there look how

2008.679 --> 2013.3300000000002
fertile the filter over there and over

2010.899 --> 2014.889
there there's it's a different but it's

2013.33 --> 2018.299
also good I could do with that Lynne

2014.889 --> 2022.4789999999998
there and so but because of that I

2018.299 --> 2027.6689999999999
didn't shoot root and then I didn't grow

2022.479 --> 2032.799
I just take a seed and I was kind of

2027.669 --> 2034.6290000000001
blown around until I eventually figured

2032.799 --> 2037.809
like what the hell was I doing

2034.629 --> 2041.259
why did I think it was a good idea not

2037.809 --> 2041.82
to just see ya spring forth wherever I

2041.259 --> 2045.15
land

2041.82 --> 2047.07
as soon as I could because I look at it

2045.15 --> 2050.4300000000003
other seedlings that have done that that

2047.07 --> 2052.38
have grown trees and yeah okay I might

2050.43 --> 2056.91
think I might be better right

2052.38 --> 2058.32
as this highly conscious seed but I can

2056.91 --> 2061.44
still see that wait

2058.32 --> 2064.05
they can reach kind of white because

2061.44 --> 2066.39
when they grow bigger these branches go

2064.05 --> 2068.75
out so they can despite a seemingly

2066.39 --> 2072.72
being stuck down they reach kind of wide

2068.75 --> 2074.94
so effectively it's not as stuck down to

2072.72 --> 2079.1699999999996
that specific spot as I originally

2074.94 --> 2081.3
thought it was and as soon as I realized

2079.17 --> 2083.58
that that's when my roots just started

2081.3 --> 2088.3700000000003
bursting out and just like okay I'm

2083.58 --> 2092.48
gonna do this right here right now and I

2088.37 --> 2092.48
feel like I'm in the middle of that

2097.17 --> 2100.63
[Music]

2098.64 --> 2103.39
what Alexander light-water

2100.63 --> 2115.09
yes sir I'm being extremely metaphorical

2103.39 --> 2120.64
here hmm the chat keep sister chat still

2115.09 --> 2124.63
up to date yeah it is weeping willows

2120.64 --> 2127.24
are strong and gentle yeah now our main

2124.63 --> 2129.85
tree in the house that I grew up in most

2127.24 --> 2134.89
of my life had a very large weeping

2129.85 --> 2137.5899999999997
willow and it even had its periods where

2134.89 --> 2143.47
it was getting sick and all that but we

2137.59 --> 2146.11
saved it like it it's a big willow like

2143.47 --> 2149.23
willows like that usually people don't

2146.11 --> 2150.9100000000003
let it grow that big I don't know if

2149.23 --> 2152.77
it's still around you know when sold the

2150.91 --> 2154.39
place there yeah they did all kinds of

2152.77 --> 2156.16
things they might have just cut it down

2154.39 --> 2159.1
at some point unfortunately but at the

2156.16 --> 2164.1299999999997
time it was huge and I climbed that

2159.1 --> 2167.47
thing I even like slept in it once just

2164.13 --> 2169.3
sitting on the branches being very

2167.47 --> 2170.6899999999996
confident that I would keep myself in

2169.3 --> 2173.78
place and I did

2170.69 --> 2173.78
[Music]

2180.51 --> 2185.59
every man gets to choose where they put

2183.1 --> 2191.29
their seed yeah yeah well that can have

2185.59 --> 2196.84
multiple meanings there but in my case

2191.29 --> 2204.67
it was all about the roots and realizing

2196.84 --> 2206.32
that yeah not having roots over time

2204.67 --> 2209.86
will become much more of a disadvantage

2206.32 --> 2216.19
than to shoot root at a place that at

2209.86 --> 2217.65
first may not seem very viable but you

2216.19 --> 2220.2400000000002
gotta figure it out of course you know

2217.65 --> 2222.25
certain type of plants with certain type

2220.24 --> 2223.8999999999996
of roots just require certain type of

2222.25 --> 2228.19
ground and if it's not the right ground

2223.9 --> 2230.08
it's not gonna happen so that could be a

2228.19 --> 2232.63
metaphorical influence to what I was

2230.08 --> 2234.5499999999997
talking about as well and that just it

2232.63 --> 2238.08
took a while for me to get to the proper

2234.55 --> 2241.3900000000003
type of viable ground because my parents

2238.08 --> 2243.94
kind of choose chose lesser ground or

2241.39 --> 2246.24
the ground got poisoned a little so it

2243.94 --> 2254.55
wasn't really that viable I had to move

2246.24 --> 2254.5499999999997
move away spiritually and I did

2256.71 --> 2259.9
[Music]

2262.829 --> 2267.259
they tell you where to plant it yep

2274.45 --> 2280.75
you as the seedling maybe gathered

2277.93 --> 2283.66
information on many places places to

2280.75 --> 2285.82
grow the potential of it oh yeah yeah as

2283.66 --> 2288.75
a seedling I've I've been blowing around

2285.82 --> 2291.04
you know around the place so I have seen

2288.75 --> 2292.44
kind of like what is out there because

2291.04 --> 2295.0299999999997
of it

2292.44 --> 2296.8
instead of just falling down going

2295.03 --> 2299.19
straight into the ground and not really

2296.8 --> 2299.19
looking around

2312.13 --> 2318.19
you know there was a period sort of I

2316.66 --> 2320.5
don't know you I don't even remember how

2318.19 --> 2326.2000000000003
long it lasted where I really tried to

2320.5 --> 2331.93
kind of figure out what being Dutch

2326.2 --> 2334.0299999999997
actually means what that is what makes

2331.93 --> 2336.7599999999998
somebody really Dutch and when is

2334.03 --> 2341.02
somebody just speaking Dutch or has been

2336.76 --> 2344.11
born Dutch and speaks Dutch but is not

2341.02 --> 2354.22
Dutch they're not or they're not they're

2344.11 --> 2358.09
like yeah are you God megatronus type

2354.22 --> 2360.25
people worldly people but not typically

2358.09 --> 2363.19
Dutch because there's a lot of those as

2360.25 --> 2368.86
well it's like typically gentrified

2363.19 --> 2370.63
people and so but yeah the words the

2368.86 --> 2373.9900000000002
country and everything has changed so

2370.63 --> 2376.54
much since I basically started that out

2373.99 --> 2378.79
in my teens that was really interested

2376.54 --> 2381.82
in like like what is it to be Dutch and

2378.79 --> 2385.75
I was all immediately very inspired by

2381.82 --> 2389.5
the in retrospect maybe slightly

2385.75 --> 2393.07
politically altered story but still very

2389.5 --> 2397.27
inspiring to me when I heard it the the

2393.07 --> 2400.9
old Dutch the founder founding of the

2397.27 --> 2403.33
the Dutch Kingdom basically routed in

2400.9 --> 2405.96
the German blood and all that and but

2403.33 --> 2409.69
that spirit and just the battles and how

2405.96 --> 2414.43
incredibly tenacious they were and proud

2409.69 --> 2422.17
and obsessive also like they were like

2414.43 --> 2425.3199999999997
zealously the yeah in control and like

2422.17 --> 2430.36
had this feeling of grand destiny of of

2425.32 --> 2432.88
a good type but still harsh and I did I

2430.36 --> 2436.15
always found that to be very fascinating

2432.88 --> 2438.9
and interesting is that really to be

2436.15 --> 2438.9
Dutch you know

2439.81 --> 2445.7889999999998
[Music]

2441.849 --> 2449.4790000000003
it's almost like what is really Dutch is

2445.789 --> 2451.579
that what Dutch people what would catch

2449.479 --> 2456.259
their attention and then make them feel

2451.579 --> 2458.21
like yes yes is that what is Dutch you

2456.259 --> 2458.869
know what is it I don't really know

2458.21 --> 2463.64
anymore

2458.869 --> 2468.44
I I couldn't call myself typically Dutch

2463.64 --> 2472.3289999999997
is death that I am I know the language

2468.44 --> 2478.329
I've lived here pretty much all my life

2472.329 --> 2480.9500000000003
but I've alienated kind of over time and

2478.329 --> 2483.6800000000003
the question still stands is like yeah

2480.95 --> 2487.3089999999997
what is really Dutch you know I know

2483.68 --> 2489.14
what typically goes around like yeah

2487.309 --> 2490.88
when you get in the circles when you get

2489.14 --> 2492.5789999999997
into place like what will conversation

2490.88 --> 2501.589
should be like what will people be like

2492.579 --> 2504.6800000000003
yes but thus what does make them Dutch

2501.589 --> 2506.839
or do they just happen to be speaking

2504.68 --> 2508.96
Dutch people that just happen to live

2506.839 --> 2512.589
there would it really matter does it

2508.96 --> 2512.589
doesn't matter to them

2519.39 --> 2529.529
like do Dutch people even kind of like

2522.569 --> 2532.7889999999998
half hope left for their country because

2529.529 --> 2535.44
in one way there's a lot of that yeah

2532.789 --> 2538.079
you could say that the Netherlands

2535.44 --> 2541.349
despite all things is still flourishing

2538.079 --> 2544.0190000000002
in many ways it seems like things are

2541.349 --> 2546.63
good yeah my experience is that it's

2544.019 --> 2548.64
like very great in the face of

2546.63 --> 2550.23
everything that's supposed to be

2548.64 --> 2553.5
happening out there we're still doing

2550.23 --> 2558.569
great but at the same time like you know

2553.5 --> 2561.119
where's our identity the politics are

2558.569 --> 2566.5099999999998
definitely not doing things that we want

2561.119 --> 2572.88
to do or that I like so extremely

2566.51 --> 2576.0
liberal and crazy crazy plants the

2572.88 --> 2578.67
carbon tax nonsense and we got this

2576.0 --> 2580.079
situation going where we are apparently

2578.67 --> 2583.0190000000002
now going to generate electricity

2580.079 --> 2587.2690000000002
through biomass and this has been known

2583.019 --> 2590.3689999999997
for a while that yeah we are cutting

2587.269 --> 2593.7589999999996
huge amounts of forest in America

2590.369 --> 2598.559
somewhere specifically just to feed into

2593.759 --> 2601.309
that it's complete insanity there's no

2598.559 --> 2605.6400000000003
point in that at all

2601.309 --> 2608.19
and like yeah that project it has to be

2605.64 --> 2610.41
abandoned it's so ridiculous and that's

2608.19 --> 2613.079
just one thing you know and then there's

2610.41 --> 2615.269
the whole windmill enthusiasm and just

2613.079 --> 2619.619
everything that's coming out about it

2615.269 --> 2621.39
that more and more about how toxic a lot

2619.619 --> 2623.099
of the productions of these things are

2621.39 --> 2626.009
and how they're like non degradable

2623.099 --> 2628.65
materials and all that like how much

2626.009 --> 2633.9
junk is actually caused by the stupidity

2628.65 --> 2636.69
of all these windmills and yeah when you

2633.9 --> 2638.9100000000003
looking at things like that

2636.69 --> 2641.03
then it's really not going that great

2638.91 --> 2643.98
after all

2641.03 --> 2648.44
stupid mistakes and things are still

2643.98 --> 2648.44
being pushed in that direction

2649.75 --> 2652.88
[Music]

2660.269 --> 2668.089
well peanuts Clark yes and is it out of

2665.759 --> 2668.089
our control

2668.119 --> 2674.6690000000003
you know I think the best control of

2672.239 --> 2677.819
these outer control situations is to

2674.669 --> 2680.8489999999997
make sure that everybody can assimilate

2677.819 --> 2683.939
it to spread it around and for some

2680.849 --> 2685.529
people that requires a lot of hype but

2683.939 --> 2687.359
at the same time there's so much hype

2685.529 --> 2689.879
with everything now that people are

2687.359 --> 2693.0589999999997
getting sick of that so to just bring it

2689.879 --> 2695.129
very carefully is in my opinion the best

2693.059 --> 2699.349
way and that just requires everybody to

2695.129 --> 2703.589
speak about it very carefully and focus

2699.349 --> 2705.9590000000003
about these situations so that people

2703.589 --> 2711.959
can come to a spiritual agreement about

2705.959 --> 2716.3689999999997
it and actually proceed to respond to

2711.959 --> 2718.9489999999996
say no this is now ending I'll write the

2716.369 --> 2721.2290000000003
plan right that you were supposedly

2718.949 --> 2724.369
working towards that's absolutely insane

2721.229 --> 2728.6989999999996
doesn't work anymore or guess what

2724.369 --> 2731.969
that's your problem nobody wanted that

2728.699 --> 2736.2290000000003
but you and people kind of went along

2731.969 --> 2739.279
with it I guess a lot of them because

2736.229 --> 2742.439
they just don't want to deal with it

2739.279 --> 2745.949
because politics make them sick

2742.439 --> 2748.759
especially in the Netherlands the the

2745.949 --> 2753.299
amount of poison and condensed lies in

2748.759 --> 2758.239
politics here is really a terrible level

2753.299 --> 2763.619
like it's a heart-wrenching painful

2758.239 --> 2769.639
situation to listen to often for me it's

2763.619 --> 2772.079
soda scholars it's like how stupid and

2769.639 --> 2775.139
disgusting and arrogant ballers can get

2772.079 --> 2777.5890000000004
a nitpicky and just red herring well

2775.139 --> 2780.929
it's exactly like that

2777.589 --> 2783.659
except a little bit more careful and and

2780.929 --> 2786.69
paranoid because they're all like oh if

2783.659 --> 2789.15
I say not exactly right then

2786.69 --> 2791.4900000000002
there's gonna be in the vote and because

2789.15 --> 2796.5
there's just constant nitpicky [ __ ]

2791.49 --> 2798.66
going on everywhere that well that's one

2796.5 --> 2805.05
of the reasons why you don't follow

2798.66 --> 2808.17
Dutch politics but I do pick up on some

2805.05 --> 2810.3900000000003
things here there and realize why I

2808.17 --> 2813.4500000000003
don't get into Dutch politics because

2810.39 --> 2818.91
it's so [ __ ] disgusting and annoying

2813.45 --> 2821.16
and painful to sit through and

2818.91 --> 2827.31
unfortunately that's kind of their yeah

2821.16 --> 2829.41
I guess it's become their tactic to just

2827.31 --> 2831.69
be so repulsive that people just stay

2829.41 --> 2835.2799999999997
away so they can kind of get away with

2831.69 --> 2837.39
their nonsense a little bit easier and

2835.28 --> 2839.599
when you look at things like that it's

2837.39 --> 2843.0
not really that greatest situation

2839.599 --> 2845.94
despite things I'll seem to be good but

2843.0 --> 2847.71
for how long for how long unless until

2845.94 --> 2850.619
just suddenly you know collapses in on

2847.71 --> 2852.15
itself because if just suddenly doesn't

2850.619 --> 2855.65
work anymore and all the structures just

2852.15 --> 2858.4500000000003
collapse like the the working structures

2855.65 --> 2860.73
well things haven't really collapsed

2858.45 --> 2863.3999999999996
super hard so far with the covert

2860.73 --> 2867.569
situation I think there's there's more

2863.4 --> 2869.099
things opening there's probably gonna be

2867.569 --> 2872.22
some depths and then the bailout

2869.099 --> 2876.44
situation but yeah things are still

2872.22 --> 2878.97
going there yeah there is no massive

2876.44 --> 2882.839
destructive situation going except maybe

2878.97 --> 2884.97
with like restaurants you know but I

2882.839 --> 2887.0099999999998
think that yeah everybody in the

2884.97 --> 2888.8999999999996
Netherlands is kind of done with the

2887.01 --> 2891.5400000000004
nonsense most of them there's still some

2888.9 --> 2893.39
mask wearers and all that but the

2891.54 --> 2895.859
economic shutdown nobody wants it

2893.39 --> 2900.75
everybody thinks it's not worth it now

2895.859 --> 2902.5499999999997
everybody like and let unless that like

2900.75 --> 2905.069
total [ __ ] that have some other plans

2902.55 --> 2907.73
or whatever but everybody that's just

2905.069 --> 2910.38
there for their business and their life

2907.73 --> 2912.48
they don't want it and that's the vast

2910.38 --> 2916.92
vast majority and so things are kind of

2912.48 --> 2919.67
reopening again apparently but if it if

2916.92 --> 2922.4500000000003
it had gone worse well then

2919.67 --> 2926.84
yeah who knows what would have happened

2922.45 --> 2931.31
because this whole setup of how the

2926.84 --> 2933.8900000000003
Netherlands kind of works it is it is

2931.31 --> 2937.37
all with relatively tight margins it's

2933.89 --> 2939.56
not like we're all gosh in with money it

2937.37 --> 2941.63
is a lot of it is kind of like used in

2939.56 --> 2944.75
just working structures like socialism

2941.63 --> 2947.42
type setups that it is sort of effective

2944.75 --> 2948.56
it's also there's a lot of development

2947.42 --> 2954.6800000000003
okay

2948.56 --> 2957.04
I'm not gonna get into this I don't know

2954.68 --> 2959.3599999999997
enough about this it's just so

2957.04 --> 2967.7599999999998
professional stuff I should talk with

2959.36 --> 2971.48
people about this more Dutch people I'd

2967.76 --> 2973.34
be interested to do to do that talk

2971.48 --> 2974.39
about like yeah what how does the

2973.34 --> 2979.52
government here in the Netherlands

2974.39 --> 2983.5099999999998
actually work like the the national the

2979.52 --> 2986.12
the provincial city governments and like

2983.51 --> 2991.9100000000003
how are things being done how does the

2986.12 --> 2993.17
money actually flow cuz yeah that's it's

2991.91 --> 2995.45
pretty complex

2993.17 --> 2999.02
you know Netherlands is definitely land

2995.45 --> 3002.71
of paperwork's right always has been

2999.02 --> 3005.11
kinda but yeah that makes it difficult

3002.71 --> 3006.76
for me to really get a good clear

3005.11 --> 3010.83
picture as to how things actually

3006.76 --> 3010.8300000000004
balance out I don't know

3025.86 --> 3028.6400000000003
all right

3029.019 --> 3036.4489999999996

3034.809 --> 3039.88

3080.019 --> 3082.439
coming

3090.02 --> 3095.71
whoa forty two hours fasting that's a

3093.95 --> 3098.71
lot Cleary

3095.71 --> 3098.71
intense

3113.18 --> 3115.75
who

3117.93 --> 3123.99
all right George Sanford well I

3119.849 --> 3127.65
personally I usually end up fasting one

3123.99 --> 3133.2599999999998
part of the day so I eat two parts and

3127.65 --> 3135.75
then don't eat another part and it's

3133.26 --> 3138.69
either in the morning so I do take

3135.75 --> 3142.799
supplements but I don't really eat for a

3138.69 --> 3145.14
while I take coffee I drink some tea I

3142.799 --> 3146.7
don't really eat I usually start to eat

3145.14 --> 3149.0
somewhere around the flat at the Bates

3146.7 --> 3149.0
time

3161.81 --> 3167.5
okay you have a one what are you talking

3165.35 --> 3167.5
about

3171.769 --> 3178.1989999999996
mmm-hmm the worst polemic in the future

3174.359 --> 3180.9
well yeah well isn't that always it like

3178.199 --> 3183.9
yeah if we're gonna get [ __ ] we're

3180.9 --> 3186.989
gonna get [ __ ] like oh yeah if the

3183.9 --> 3188.789
place blows up then we got a place

3186.989 --> 3193.039
that's blown up yeah

3188.789 --> 3196.5490000000004
I know I don't really see the point of

3193.039 --> 3200.4
pondering upon that like how do you know

3196.549 --> 3203.5389999999998
something like that is gonna happen do

3200.4 --> 3203.539
you know what is gonna happen

3207.89 --> 3211.7799999999997
does something have to happen

3246.93 --> 3252.6499999999996
a many young welcome back got five more

3250.47 --> 3252.6499999999996
minutes

3256.869 --> 3263.19
really 2,000 years of history okay

3266.73 --> 3272.96
I just know there's a strong correlation

3269.04 --> 3275.85
every time with periods of heavy disease

3272.96 --> 3281.34
it's usually followed up by extreme

3275.85 --> 3288.5
demoralization and yeah that can be all

3281.34 --> 3292.08
kinds of things usually massive death or

3288.5 --> 3299.48
like like complete enslavement

3292.08 --> 3302.2799999999997
situations or just mass abuse but like

3299.48 --> 3306.66
extremely more like more the open

3302.28 --> 3312.03
demoralisation just demoralisation often

3306.66 --> 3315.56
is precede is followed up by by extreme

3312.03 --> 3315.5600000000004
disease periods

3326.87 --> 3333.29
it's like this I am not worried about

3329.9 --> 3335.4100000000003
disease disease is always secondary to

3333.29 --> 3335.41
me

3348.44 --> 3354.369
that just in plague never heard of that

3364.859 --> 3372.799
all right you haven't yeah but but it is

3368.459 --> 3372.799
very obvious like how that arrived

3399.48 --> 3405.36
right let's blame the obvious right you

3402.93 --> 3406.02
have like what created the bubonic

3405.36 --> 3412.6200000000003
plague

3406.02 --> 3414.78
well combination of said poor hygiene as

3412.62 --> 3420.06
always they're part of that kind of

3414.78 --> 3427.8300000000004
thing and just this terrible nobility

3420.06 --> 3431.16
treatment of the subjects and and like

3427.83 --> 3432.87
senseless wars one noble against another

3431.16 --> 3436.3199999999997
just sending their people to their

3432.87 --> 3442.77
deaths because I'm some stupid feud or

3436.32 --> 3445.17
whatever so wasn't that it just again

3442.77 --> 3447.39
extreme demoralization over prolonged

3445.17 --> 3452.54
period and combine in combination with

3447.39 --> 3456.23
poor extremely poor hygiene well yeah

3452.54 --> 3456.23
what do you think is gonna happen

3470.589 --> 3475.269
it got colder in Europe and crops filled

3473.109 --> 3478.21
three years in a row okay well yeah

3475.269 --> 3480.4599999999996
that's well if that that also happened

3478.21 --> 3483.4
well that's gonna help that's gonna be

3480.46 --> 3487.089
very demoralizing as well and hey a lack

3483.4 --> 3488.92
of food is a lack of nutrition that's

3487.089 --> 3492.4
not gonna help either so yeah combine

3488.92 --> 3496.0190000000002
all those factors like demoralization

3492.4 --> 3498.549
from crop failure demoralization from

3496.019 --> 3502.2
nobilities treating everybody like [ __ ]

3498.549 --> 3507.4
and not allowing you to learn things

3502.2 --> 3511.739
poor hygiene and sadly barely any food

3507.4 --> 3516.64
around yeah well you got four elements

3511.739 --> 3520.259
it's like how could the plague not erupt

3516.64 --> 3520.259
you would almost say

3527.07 --> 3533.73
yeah but poor hygiene comes from lack of

3529.38 --> 3538.62
knowledge because if you know then

3533.73 --> 3541.7400000000002
you're not gonna do that anymore or

3538.62 --> 3550.17
you're gonna try to build something to

3541.74 --> 3554.64
avoid that Thank You Amanda young for
