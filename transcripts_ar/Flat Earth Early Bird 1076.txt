104.88 --> 108.479
gray

105.84 --> 110.56
there doesn't seem to be any wind

108.479 --> 112.799
barely any

110.56 --> 114.799
almost nothing

112.799 --> 117.60000000000001
so yeah quite a contrast to the weather

114.799 --> 117.60000000000001
from yesterday

120.56 --> 125.43900000000001
and yeah there's

122.479 --> 128.959
probably a lot of moist in the air it

125.439 --> 129.679
it does feel cold outside even though it

128.959 --> 133.28
is

129.679 --> 133.28
like still 12 degrees

138.319 --> 141.44
so

140.0 --> 143.12
anyway

141.44 --> 146.76
yeah a bit bit of

143.12 --> 146.76
a gray day

157.84 --> 162.0
right

159.68 --> 164.72
hello america silver patriot first in

178.38 --> 181.43
[Music]

185.2 --> 188.79999999999998
the weather outside is not as nice

187.92 --> 191.51899999999998
as

188.8 --> 193.59900000000002
in my background

191.519 --> 197.87900000000002
but oh well

193.599 --> 197.879
oh pointing the wrong way

202.159 --> 207.28
can get a little confusing that it's

203.92 --> 207.28
actually a mirror image

208.319 --> 212.879
anyway

210.48 --> 215.51899999999998
i'll get the hang of it one day i mean

212.879 --> 216.319
maybe when i'm at 2000 shows i'll get it

215.519 --> 218.799
right

216.319 --> 218.79899999999998
every time

221.2 --> 226.959
right

222.48 --> 230.879
so yesterday was a pretty intense day

226.959 --> 230.879
to be expected fridays you know

233.519 --> 237.04
so

234.48 --> 237.04

for some reason

264.88 --> 267.88

because it's a lot of fun

270.4 --> 274.15999999999997

super late night

298.08 --> 302.15999999999997

300.0 --> 304.08
like a clip video

302.16 --> 307.12

304.08 --> 309.19899999999996
relig the religion of satellites

307.12 --> 311.28000000000003
like tracing back how the science

309.199 --> 314.16
fiction versus the

311.28 --> 315.19899999999996
supposed real life projects

314.16 --> 317.28000000000003
how that

315.199 --> 319.91900000000004
has been going about with visual

317.28 --> 319.919
examples

320.56 --> 327.36
is a really great clip

324.16 --> 331.639
totally on target anyway hello jeff gas

327.36 --> 331.639
head good to see you

341.12 --> 343.36
what

343.52 --> 347.28
is happening with my chat

350.479 --> 353.479
huh

363.039 --> 366.44
that's odd

382.319 --> 388.0
right i think i know how to fix this

385.52 --> 388.0
i hope

391.039 --> 395.59999999999997
right

393.12 --> 400.16
i bounded my chat

395.6 --> 404.6
but the original in obs is still bigger

400.16 --> 404.6
i think that is the real problem

423.919 --> 427.44
right i'm gonna have to fix this some

425.84 --> 428.96
other time

427.44 --> 430.88
i guess

428.96 --> 433.599
until i fix it

430.88 --> 437.639
the beginning the first few comments

433.599 --> 437.639
will just never be visible

438.24 --> 442.479
right anyways just a detailed thingy

446.16 --> 449.96000000000004
let's get back to chat

451.759 --> 458.0
you not out in the streets uh what what

454.08 --> 458.0
kind of a remark is that clap ruckus

459.52 --> 466.79999999999995
by the way i did like bump into

463.039 --> 469.44
pretty bizarre art well bizarre

466.8 --> 471.52000000000004
maybe a bit shocking to me

469.44 --> 476.68
apparently there's been like riots in

471.52 --> 476.68
rotterdam a big city in my country

479.759 --> 485.199
and people got shot by the police like

482.319 --> 485.199
actually shot

487.759 --> 491.039
although

489.039 --> 493.759
they didn't say he straight out got

491.039 --> 495.919
killed i don't think he did but still

493.759 --> 497.599
like

495.919 --> 500.87899999999996
yeah this sort of thing doesn't happen

497.599 --> 503.759
that often in the netherlands

500.879 --> 507.0
and seems like people are quite outraged

503.759 --> 507.0
about it

511.599 --> 515.3199999999999
we'll see what happens

526.48 --> 531.12
did they shoot back no

528.64 --> 532.88
no america's overpatriot

531.12 --> 535.04
i mean they prob they might have like

532.88 --> 537.36
thrown rocks or something

535.04 --> 540.0
i did see a lot of fireworks like in the

537.36 --> 540.0
video clip

543.04 --> 547.92
but no no

545.44 --> 548.9590000000001
our demonstrators don't they're not

547.92 --> 551.92
allowed to

548.959 --> 551.92
carry guns here

561.6 --> 566.48
but i think also that like the by doing

564.48 --> 569.12
this the police there kind of like

566.48 --> 569.12
overstep

570.56 --> 575.1999999999999
their legal grounds in a way

573.12 --> 578.44
because yeah you're not

575.2 --> 580.88
supposed to be like shooting

578.44 --> 584.24
demonstrators with

580.88 --> 586.32
with actual live ammunition

584.24 --> 589.9590000000001
as long as you're not like getting like

586.32 --> 589.9590000000001
overtly assaulted

590.48 --> 594.5600000000001
and i'm pretty sure that's not what

592.24 --> 594.5600000000001
happened

603.2 --> 607.12
right so i just bumped into this

608.64 --> 613.76
an hour before the show roughly

611.839 --> 615.839
i'll link you up to the dutch article

613.76 --> 619.8389999999999
but yeah it's all dutch so but there's

615.839 --> 619.839
still videos in there too

631.68 --> 635.76
right so that happened

633.76 --> 637.2
and of course the whole written house

635.76 --> 640.48
thing

637.2 --> 643.0400000000001
which was like a very dubious event

640.48 --> 643.04
overall

644.959 --> 651.04
but

647.6 --> 654.32
yeah i don't well i don't think like

651.04 --> 654.3199999999999
the guy himself is

658.16 --> 662.079
well i do think that he basically just

660.32 --> 664.0790000000001
tried to do the right thing in the

662.079 --> 665.76
situation hey even when it originally

664.079 --> 667.12
came up and people asked me in chat what

665.76 --> 667.92
is it now

667.12 --> 669.839
over

667.92 --> 672.24
what is it during

669.839 --> 674.0
is it before or after january 6 i don't

672.24 --> 676.9590000000001
even remember exactly when it was like a

674.0 --> 680.32
year ago or something i just knew from

676.959 --> 682.7199999999999
my visions like yeah that guy is

680.32 --> 684.0790000000001
innocent like doesn't matter what how

682.72 --> 686.1600000000001
bad

684.079 --> 688.8
you're gonna get it

686.16 --> 691.279
how bad he's gonna get smeared and

688.8 --> 692.7199999999999
and all that he's gonna be is i knew it

691.279 --> 695.12
back then

692.72 --> 696.1600000000001
and he did like on all accounts i saw it

695.12 --> 700.079
and

696.16 --> 700.079
then some crowds went wild

700.32 --> 706.88
how far is rod way is rotterdam from you

703.839 --> 710.44
well by american standards very close by

706.88 --> 710.4399999999999
everything is

728.56 --> 732.959
it's

729.6 --> 735.9200000000001
according to the google search 48 and a

732.959 --> 735.92
half kilometers

740.279 --> 745.68
45-minute draw

743.279 --> 747.519
minute drive what the hell is wrong

745.68 --> 750.3199999999999
today with all this phlegm

747.519 --> 750.32
super annoying

751.279 --> 754.279
hmm

767.12 --> 772.639
gerund and earth both come from a

769.68 --> 774.079
different angle what

772.639 --> 777.0790000000001
what are you talking about george

774.079 --> 777.079
sanford

793.44 --> 798.32
am i still working on making a family

795.76 --> 799.6
well it's on my mind don't worry about

798.32 --> 800.399
that

799.6 --> 802.9590000000001
yeah

800.399 --> 807.399
constantly bringing that up

802.959 --> 807.399
is not gonna make things go faster

823.839 --> 828.5600000000001
a

824.68 --> 830.959
1968 song

828.56 --> 830.959
what

831.6 --> 838.0790000000001
are you sure that's like real or was it

834.079 --> 840.399
like made to sound and look like a 68

838.079 --> 840.399
song

840.56 --> 843.8389999999999
slow mo moon buggy

845.44 --> 847.7600000000001
god

852.88 --> 857.8
it's real okay well could you link it up

858.0 --> 863.639
i want to see that

860.079 --> 863.6389999999999
or hear that

883.12 --> 888.16
okay family is important i would make a

886.16 --> 890.3199999999999
great father

888.16 --> 890.3199999999999
i

902.88 --> 906.88
i probably would unless the kid would

904.959 --> 907.76
like

906.88 --> 910.079
that

907.76 --> 911.8389999999999
like a big ego like me and just get it

910.079 --> 913.76
in their head like

911.839 --> 917.7600000000001
that they get obsessed with breaking me

913.76 --> 917.76
like that's one fear like because

917.839 --> 921.6800000000001
yeah

919.199 --> 924.24
because that's kind of what i used to do

921.68 --> 927.04
as a kid and i'm kind of afraid that my

924.24 --> 929.04
kid would do it too

927.04 --> 932.24
like

929.04 --> 934.3199999999999
that he would as my kid knowing me and

932.24 --> 936.72
knowing like the relation

934.32 --> 939.6
that they would just that he would

936.72 --> 942.0790000000001
he or she

939.6 --> 942.9590000000001
maybe if not nothing if she

942.079 --> 945.4399999999999
but

942.959 --> 945.4399999999999
i don't know

946.0 --> 949.44
well kids are challenging

951.839 --> 955.839
but i certainly have a lot of training

956.0 --> 962.48
i mean i deal with trolls all the time

959.839 --> 965.44
of different sorts

962.48 --> 967.04
it's the really smart ones

965.44 --> 969.0400000000001
that are obsessed with you that are

967.04 --> 969.8389999999999
problematic

969.04 --> 972.56
so

969.839 --> 974.8000000000001
yeah i don't know

972.56 --> 976.88
i'm certainly not taking it all super

974.8 --> 978.88
lightly like oh yeah just

976.88 --> 980.8389999999999
just get a kid everything will be super

978.88 --> 983.279
smooth

980.839 --> 986.9590000000001
yeah no

983.279 --> 986.959
that's not how that works i know

990.079 --> 994.2399999999999
i bet my kid would have good morals

994.839 --> 1001.36
well he would get have moral instincts

999.04 --> 1004.399
that are very powerful but if that would

1001.36 --> 1007.44
turn into well-developed morals

1004.399 --> 1009.36
it's gonna have to be their choice

1007.44 --> 1010.9590000000001
you can't force that

1009.36 --> 1012.32
you can try

1010.959 --> 1014.88
and then they will

1012.32 --> 1017.839
mimic that

1014.88 --> 1020.639
but that's also brings the risk that at

1017.839 --> 1023.6
some point they're like okay i'm finally

1020.639 --> 1026.0
i can be my own man or my own woman and

1023.6 --> 1028.319
then they literally just dropped that

1026.0 --> 1028.319
shell

1029.12 --> 1033.1989999999998
and it turns out that they don't have

1031.12 --> 1035.76
those morals so

1033.199 --> 1035.76
yeah i'm

1036.48 --> 1039.839
you can't

1037.6 --> 1042.079
just force that sort of thing they have

1039.839 --> 1042.079
to

1042.799 --> 1047.76
want it they also yeah but i will

1045.28 --> 1050.6399999999999
probably tell them like

1047.76 --> 1052.64
very soon early on is like i will try to

1050.64 --> 1055.2
explain like the experience like yeah

1052.64 --> 1057.039
life really is about the challenge

1055.2 --> 1059.6000000000001
the things that are the hardest are the

1057.039 --> 1061.84
most rewarding

1059.6 --> 1063.28
if you succeed

1061.84 --> 1064.9599999999998
so don't

1063.28 --> 1067.44
avoid

1064.96 --> 1069.28
challenges even though

1067.44 --> 1070.96
yeah they make you afraid or something

1069.28 --> 1073.9189999999999
like that right

1070.96 --> 1075.8400000000001
i'll probably be like really focused on

1073.919 --> 1078.96
that because that's

1075.84 --> 1081.36
super important like that would

1078.96 --> 1083.76
because that is exactly what i would

1081.36 --> 1084.799
have needed when i was a kid

1083.76 --> 1087.2
and

1084.799 --> 1089.44
my parents did it

1087.2 --> 1092.72
like when i was preaching and it was

1089.44 --> 1096.48
really good but then as soon as like

1092.72 --> 1098.32
like the teen came in they didn't know

1096.48 --> 1101.3600000000001
how to do that anymore it's like i

1098.32 --> 1101.36
became too strong

1103.2 --> 1108.0800000000002
they couldn't handle me

1105.76 --> 1110.4
so i'm going to be

1108.08 --> 1113.28
ready to handle

1110.4 --> 1114.96
me as i was

1113.28 --> 1118.08
when i have kids

1114.96 --> 1119.3600000000001
i hope i'm certainly gonna be aware of

1118.08 --> 1122.36
that

1119.36 --> 1122.36
right

1138.16 --> 1141.8400000000001
right and by the way by meaning too

1140.48 --> 1143.919
strong i

1141.84 --> 1145.6789999999999
i mean meant like in my teens too

1143.919 --> 1147.8400000000001
intense

1145.679 --> 1150.48
and like

1147.84 --> 1152.3999999999999
the extreme feelings kind of rubbed off

1150.48 --> 1156.16
on my parents and they couldn't handle

1152.4 --> 1156.16
it i was just too intense

1156.24 --> 1161.1200000000001
not necessarily like dominant and in

1158.64 --> 1163.919
control type of strong you know that was

1161.12 --> 1165.9189999999999
just really intense and i'm still kind

1163.919 --> 1168.0800000000002
of really intense

1165.919 --> 1170.48
everybody knows that by now

1168.08 --> 1173.9189999999999
right can you imagine that intensity

1170.48 --> 1176.0
without any kind of grip or confidence

1173.919 --> 1177.76
yeah

1176.0 --> 1180.16
there were people that just straight out

1177.76 --> 1181.28
thought that guy is freaking out of his

1180.16 --> 1183.52
mind

1181.28 --> 1185.52
he's he's going to end up in a loony bin

1183.52 --> 1187.44
because of that intensity and the lack

1185.52 --> 1190.08
of control

1187.44 --> 1192.4
never did any physical violence by the

1190.08 --> 1194.3999999999999
way i've like really conditioned myself

1192.4 --> 1196.0800000000002
very early on to

1194.4 --> 1199.2
like

1196.08 --> 1201.28
mechanically pacify myself

1199.2 --> 1204.24
when the emotions get too strong so that

1201.28 --> 1207.12
i literally freeze up my my jaw won't

1204.24 --> 1209.44
freeze up my lungs won't freeze up but i

1207.12 --> 1211.1999999999998
won't be able to like

1209.44 --> 1213.52
start smashing or something right

1211.2 --> 1215.52
because once you start smashing then

1213.52 --> 1218.0
it's like more more and before you know

1215.52 --> 1220.6399999999999
it like when it's serious rage when it's

1218.0 --> 1223.039
like like totally out of control rage as

1220.64 --> 1224.24
soon as you start like i gotta get it

1223.039 --> 1226.64
out and you start

1224.24 --> 1228.159
just banging something with some people

1226.64 --> 1230.0800000000002
that really have rage problem it goes

1228.159 --> 1232.0800000000002
out of control so it's like

1230.08 --> 1234.29
never that first bang

1232.08 --> 1235.6
never just like let it

1234.29 --> 1237.84
[Music]

1235.6 --> 1240.08
zap you on the inside

1237.84 --> 1242.799
and then brace and then through that

1240.08 --> 1245.52
weaken up so that it dies down rather

1242.799 --> 1249.2
than just letting it unleash somehow

1245.52 --> 1250.8799999999999
right and that evens with words

1249.2 --> 1253.6000000000001
because yeah when you then break and

1250.88 --> 1255.6000000000001
open your mouth it can words when you're

1253.6 --> 1258.6399999999999
really pissed off then suddenly it

1255.6 --> 1260.0
becomes like super scattergunning

1258.64 --> 1261.919
assault

1260.0 --> 1264.72
it's the same effect but yeah it's just

1261.919 --> 1264.72
going to be verbal

1265.28 --> 1270.72
not good thing to have that happen face

1268.32 --> 1272.32
in face-to-face situations always

1270.72 --> 1274.0
terrible results

1272.32 --> 1276.48
if you're lucky it's just like they're

1274.0 --> 1278.72
going to walk away

1276.48 --> 1280.799
anyway i did yeah this got all really

1278.72 --> 1283.1200000000001
intense all of a sudden

1280.799 --> 1285.679
but i guess that's also on my mind when

1283.12 --> 1288.32
kids are concerned that would be my

1285.679 --> 1290.4
offspring like they're not gonna be easy

1288.32 --> 1292.3999999999999
guys they're gonna be like little

1290.4 --> 1294.0800000000002
freaking r wins

1292.4 --> 1296.64
probably

1294.08 --> 1299.52
like if they're even half my intensity

1296.64 --> 1300.3200000000002
that's gonna be like oh [ __ ]

1299.52 --> 1301.84
but

1300.32 --> 1305.039
right

1301.84 --> 1307.36
but hey who knows maybe i can find the

1305.039 --> 1309.12
exact right woman that'll balance that

1307.36 --> 1310.9599999999998
out that intensity

1309.12 --> 1313.12
so that it's their kids are gonna have

1310.96 --> 1314.64
more natural focus

1313.12 --> 1319.84
we'll see

1314.64 --> 1319.8400000000001
yeah it's on my mind it really is

1323.52 --> 1327.28
where in the netherlands do you hope to

1325.52 --> 1332.039
dude

1327.28 --> 1332.039
see me traveler i have no idea

1332.24 --> 1335.36
this

1333.039 --> 1338.0
dude like oh

1335.36 --> 1340.559
that falls into the category is like oh

1338.0 --> 1343.52
what type of bricks am i gonna use for

1340.559 --> 1345.2
my new castle

1343.52 --> 1347.76
like

1345.2 --> 1349.8400000000001
maybe in 40 years in an optimal

1347.76 --> 1353.36
situation where i'm super focused and

1349.84 --> 1354.8799999999999
obsessed with that like dude why would i

1353.36 --> 1358.4799999999998
think about that right now it's

1354.88 --> 1360.7990000000002
literally building air castles

1358.48 --> 1363.6
like i'm right here right now in this

1360.799 --> 1366.1589999999999
situation let's not get concerned with

1363.6 --> 1369.1589999999999
like very fair advanced stage

1366.159 --> 1369.159
developments

1387.679 --> 1392.0800000000002
you have four kids in their 30s all

1390.32 --> 1394.1589999999999
different

1392.08 --> 1396.1589999999999
right

1394.159 --> 1398.24
i well i wasn't saying they're all

1396.159 --> 1399.6000000000001
literally gonna be like clones of me or

1398.24 --> 1401.679
something

1399.6 --> 1404.32
but just with that intensity and then of

1401.679 --> 1406.64
course if they manage to like handle

1404.32 --> 1407.6
that they will become their own people

1406.64 --> 1408.64
and i

1407.6 --> 1410.48
like

1408.64 --> 1411.8400000000001
i wouldn't be surprised for example if

1410.48 --> 1414.559
like

1411.84 --> 1416.24
i got a daughter and she's just like my

1414.559 --> 1420.559
mother

1416.24 --> 1422.96
with like the craziness of my mother too

1420.559 --> 1425.12
right i wouldn't be surprised

1422.96 --> 1427.279
i'm kind of expecting it or my grandma

1425.12 --> 1427.279
or

1428.96 --> 1435.279
or maybe my grandfather who by the way

1432.4 --> 1437.919
i've never known like i've never even

1435.279 --> 1437.919
seen them

1438.48 --> 1442.799
face to face move ever so i don't know

1441.12 --> 1446.1589999999999
who he is at all

1442.799 --> 1446.1589999999999
but maybe he'll come back

1448.799 --> 1454.559
we'll see

1450.48 --> 1454.559
hello nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

1455.039 --> 1458.8799999999999
i must have high standards for a woman

1457.2 --> 1460.559
dude kapono

1458.88 --> 1462.4
insane standards

1460.559 --> 1465.039
like they basically have to be their own

1462.4 --> 1467.679
sorceress

1465.039 --> 1470.96
that isn't completely obsessed with

1467.679 --> 1473.6000000000001
power and like all fractured uh yeah try

1470.96 --> 1476.48
to find that

1473.6 --> 1479.4399999999998
like oh yeah all i'm looking for is is

1476.48 --> 1481.76
just like a virgin sorceress

1479.44 --> 1483.1200000000001
right because those walk around plenty

1481.76 --> 1485.12
right uh

1483.12 --> 1487.84
no

1485.12 --> 1487.84
i don't know

1488.64 --> 1495.039
but i do like like

1491.44 --> 1496.88
they have to be intelligent like

1495.039 --> 1499.12
otherwise they're just going to be like

1496.88 --> 1502.24
staring at me as i talk about things all

1499.12 --> 1505.12
the time like oh you sound so smart and

1502.24 --> 1507.1200000000001
completely pointless

1505.12 --> 1509.6
it's completely pointless

1507.12 --> 1512.4799999999998
they have to

1509.6 --> 1515.84
have like mechanical smarts

1512.48 --> 1515.84
of some kind

1516.24 --> 1519.1200000000001
and

1517.679 --> 1520.64
well more recently i've been very

1519.12 --> 1524.12
attracted to like

1520.64 --> 1524.1200000000001
doctor types

1531.36 --> 1534.3999999999999
the hell are they doing

1536.0 --> 1539.36
just lighting fireworks

1540.0 --> 1544.4
it's

1540.84 --> 1544.3999999999999
illegal who cares

1553.12 --> 1558.6399999999999
right but on the other hand

1556.559 --> 1560.8799999999999
on a more realistic note

1558.64 --> 1563.6000000000001
i have a better chance of actually

1560.88 --> 1566.159
finding that sort of woman that is also

1563.6 --> 1571.12
interested in me and available

1566.159 --> 1573.88
if i just learn to socialize more so

1571.12 --> 1577.12
i am having like

1573.88 --> 1579.44
infiltration plans it's like okay what

1577.12 --> 1580.7199999999998
is going to be sort of my normie mode

1579.44 --> 1585.039
now

1580.72 --> 1587.919
because otherwise i'm i'm not gonna

1585.039 --> 1592.4
be able to communicate with people

1587.919 --> 1592.4
like they're yeah i will be

1593.76 --> 1597.279
too isolated

1596.559 --> 1600.08
and

1597.279 --> 1602.72
yeah it's a big deal for me

1600.08 --> 1604.6399999999999
it's like what is my normie act

1602.72 --> 1608.32
this is

1604.64 --> 1611.039
so far it's just the weather it's just

1608.32 --> 1613.279
me being me and not saying a lot

1611.039 --> 1618.559
but still being open for it

1613.279 --> 1618.559
like any person can just like address me

1618.64 --> 1622.64
and i'll probably roll out a whole

1620.799 --> 1624.08
response no matter really what it's

1622.64 --> 1626.159
about

1624.08 --> 1628.3999999999999
and it will have like intricate advice

1626.159 --> 1632.0
because that's what i do it's what i do

1628.4 --> 1635.3600000000001
here it's like people just throw out a

1632.0 --> 1637.6
a question and i immediately

1635.36 --> 1639.1999999999998
like like almost like a computer just

1637.6 --> 1642.8799999999999
roll out

1639.2 --> 1642.88
in in detail response

1643.039 --> 1647.52
and i do that face to face too

1645.44 --> 1650.3200000000002
bit weird i guess

1647.52 --> 1650.32
that's what i am

1651.6 --> 1655.48
a one photo unit

1655.679 --> 1661.1200000000001
i will never be a fully developed man

1657.84 --> 1661.12
for being childless what

1661.76 --> 1664.76
okay

1671.12 --> 1676.36
well i think it's rather about rolls so

1690.32 --> 1696.08
an intelligent virgin sorcerer's doctor

1692.88 --> 1698.3990000000001
wouldn't be hard to find

1696.08 --> 1698.399
right

1698.72 --> 1701.039
yeah

1702.08 --> 1705.1999999999998
well they are out there

1705.44 --> 1710.48
it's just that they are so targeted by

1708.399 --> 1712.32
temptation so they have to have talent

1710.48 --> 1715.1200000000001
against that they have to be able to

1712.32 --> 1716.08
realize like i have a lot of power and

1715.12 --> 1719.039
it's like

1716.08 --> 1721.76
constantly surrounded by a big

1719.039 --> 1723.279
weird beast system that tries to unravel

1721.76 --> 1727.279
me

1723.279 --> 1727.279
brace against that forever

1728.48 --> 1732.88
and they have to kind of like naturally

1731.679 --> 1735.2
do that

1732.88 --> 1738.3990000000001
and then

1735.2 --> 1740.48
never give that up

1738.399 --> 1743.039
and even better would be if they would

1740.48 --> 1745.919
consciously realize that and then never

1743.039 --> 1748.1589999999999
give up either anyway

1745.919 --> 1750.0800000000002
make her feel important but don't seem

1748.159 --> 1752.3990000000001
to desperate

1750.08 --> 1756.399
make her feel no

1752.399 --> 1760.1589999999999
i'm not i don't manipulate women i only

1756.399 --> 1763.039
i'm only genuine i will console them

1760.159 --> 1763.0390000000002
when they need it

1764.84 --> 1770.799
but no i don't

1767.279 --> 1770.799
play those types of games

1770.96 --> 1776.32
like i actually respect women

1773.679 --> 1779.48
by not manipulating them even if i don't

1776.32 --> 1779.48
know them

1795.279 --> 1799.44
by the way any feedback from my

1803.12 --> 1806.399
my militant

1806.84 --> 1811.1999999999998
resistance speech yesterday

1811.52 --> 1818.1589999999999
like in retrospect i'm like whoa

1814.24 --> 1818.159
i actually all said that didn't i

1819.12 --> 1823.6789999999999
is it just crazy irwin

1821.679 --> 1826.159
is it

1823.679 --> 1827.039
some kind of a prediction for the future

1826.159 --> 1829.8400000000001
still

1827.039 --> 1832.08
which is kind of what it was or what was

1829.84 --> 1832.08
that

1832.399 --> 1837.279
like did i overstep boundaries or did i

1835.039 --> 1840.559
actually

1837.279 --> 1840.559
nailed it right on the head

1840.72 --> 1843.679
i even asked back then

1842.559 --> 1846.24
but

1843.679 --> 1848.72
it's like oh are we saying something

1846.24 --> 1850.96
really complex again let's

1848.72 --> 1853.44
pretend like it never happened and just

1850.96 --> 1855.679

1870.799 --> 1874.96
show yesterday was awesome

1873.2 --> 1878.919
hilarious

1874.96 --> 1878.919
and the evolution talk

1895.919 --> 1901.679
there is a big protest really okay

1899.679 --> 1904.159
is that happening right now

1901.679 --> 1906.48
i haven't seen any articles

well that must be just happening because

1935.679 --> 1940.48
i i'm not seeing any kind of articles

1938.24 --> 1943.76
about that just yet

1940.48 --> 1943.76
any paris

demonstration can i give a review of my

1949.919 --> 1953.279
militant speech no

1956.399 --> 1963.08
you're gonna have to watch it back on

1958.48 --> 1963.08
yesterday's show second half

1972.24 --> 1976.96
he does a very good english accent well

1975.36 --> 1978.9599999999998
gadget inspector

1976.96 --> 1981.279
decent

1978.96 --> 1983.6000000000001
for an american his english accent is

1981.279 --> 1985.84
great

1983.6 --> 1987.6789999999999
but americans are never super good at

1985.84 --> 1989.6
that they just

1987.679 --> 1992.3990000000001
resort to types

1989.6 --> 1992.399
and yeah the

1992.559 --> 1997.039
jim bob is a master at like types

1998.559 --> 2003.6789999999999
it's hilarious

2000.24 --> 2005.279
what's the name again of the dawkins

2003.679 --> 2008.3200000000002
the evolution

2005.279 --> 2012.12
professor with

2008.32 --> 2012.12
like the exaggerated

2012.559 --> 2018.96
ninian type of way of speaking very

2016.88 --> 2020.7990000000002
patronizing

2018.96 --> 2023.76
he does that great

2020.799 --> 2026.32
and yes they actually kind of do sound

2023.76 --> 2029.519
like that a lot of these guys

2026.32 --> 2031.279
he over exaggerates it a little

2029.519 --> 2034.24
actually kind of a lot he does over

2031.279 --> 2035.919
exaggerated including like the

2034.24 --> 2037.919
jordan peterson

2035.919 --> 2041.3600000000001
super over exaggerated but you do

2037.919 --> 2041.3600000000001
recognize like the elements

2043.36 --> 2046.76
but it's hilarious

2049.359 --> 2052.399
you missed the speech

2052.72 --> 2060.3199999999997
all right well i was just making it

2055.599 --> 2062.159
to summarize it i was making a case why

2060.32 --> 2064.8
just building

2062.159 --> 2067.359
and ignoring the beast

2064.8 --> 2070.0
is basically not enough

2067.359 --> 2071.44
because eventually the beast still

2070.0 --> 2073.76
will

2071.44 --> 2076.56
like tactically grow

2073.76 --> 2078.7200000000003
more aggressive and and will like find

2076.56 --> 2082.159
nonsense reasons and whatever to come

2078.72 --> 2082.1589999999997
after you about everything

2082.24 --> 2087.4399999999996
like even if you're somewhere in the

2084.159 --> 2089.2000000000003
woods all self-sufficient not

2087.44 --> 2091.919
relying on any

2089.2 --> 2094.0
trade from the outside

2091.919 --> 2094.96
they're still gonna come after you after

2094.0 --> 2095.679
a while

2094.96 --> 2100.44
so

2095.679 --> 2100.44
that was my case it's base yeah

2102.079 --> 2105.8390000000004
building alone is not enough like

2103.839 --> 2108.32
there's something about this

2105.839 --> 2109.2799999999997
constitution and the second amendment

2108.32 --> 2113.119
and like

2109.28 --> 2114.4
the contract has to be fulfilled

2113.119 --> 2117.6800000000003
like

2114.4 --> 2120.48
the second amendment is like a vow of

2117.68 --> 2122.16
the people and it has to be fulfilled in

2120.48 --> 2123.92
a way that's kind of what it feels like

2122.16 --> 2125.68
to me

2123.92 --> 2126.8
and

2125.68 --> 2128.839
that

2126.8 --> 2131.76
like

2128.839 --> 2134.72
passivity opponent is counting on it

2131.76 --> 2137.3590000000004
it's not counting on us actually

2134.72 --> 2138.9599999999996
starting a fight it's counting on the

2137.359 --> 2141.44
passivity

2138.96 --> 2144.8
and the fear of loss

2141.44 --> 2146.64
making you not step out of line

2144.8 --> 2149.119
that's what it's counting on that's what

2146.64 --> 2152.52
i feel about it

2149.119 --> 2152.52
from my perspective

2181.28 --> 2187.7200000000003
well flat side effie

2183.92 --> 2187.7200000000003
yeah that's the point

2188.88 --> 2192.7200000000003
rights

2190.88 --> 2194.88
are like vows

2192.72 --> 2197.7599999999998
like declarations

2194.88 --> 2201.359
but it comes with a responsibility it's

2197.76 --> 2204.0
like a contract with god

2201.359 --> 2205.04
like this is it this is where we hold

2204.0 --> 2208.32
the line

2205.04 --> 2211.2799999999997
that means we hold the line

2208.32 --> 2213.3590000000004
we don't just like oh that's all right

2211.28 --> 2215.76
that's all right and then said violated

2213.359 --> 2219.2799999999997
and then you do nothing

2215.76 --> 2219.28
right then you lose it

2220.4 --> 2226.2400000000002
so yeah by saying it's just for show

2224.0 --> 2228.32
it is for the beast

2226.24 --> 2230.0
they're trying to compartmentalize it

2228.32 --> 2233.839
into a show

2230.0 --> 2237.2
while they just walt right over it

2233.839 --> 2241.56
and we shouldn't allow them to

2237.2 --> 2241.56
there should be serious repercussions

2246.56 --> 2250.32
and not just like

2248.24 --> 2252.4799999999996
a bunch of slaps on the fingers like

2250.32 --> 2257.2000000000003
serious repercussions

2252.48 --> 2259.599
they have gone too far like way too far

2257.2 --> 2260.96
and the further they go

2259.599 --> 2264.0
with that

2260.96 --> 2267.119
at some point complaining about it

2264.0 --> 2268.24
makes you [ __ ]

2267.119 --> 2271.839
makes you

2268.24 --> 2273.839
passive aggressive coward

2271.839 --> 2275.7599999999998
because complaining about it is useless

2273.839 --> 2277.7599999999998
it's pointing out the obvious no it's

2275.76 --> 2280.0
not time for complaining at some point

2277.76 --> 2282.5600000000004
when they go too far and they do

2280.0 --> 2285.839
it's time for actual

2282.56 --> 2285.839
dramatic action

2287.119 --> 2291.04
to actually stop them

2294.32 --> 2298.4
because otherwise they win and they grow

2297.04 --> 2301.52
worse

2298.4 --> 2303.359
and worse and worse and it is they are

2301.52 --> 2305.28
we know it we've seen it

2303.359 --> 2306.88
all of us can feel it

2305.28 --> 2309.119
it is growing worse

2306.88 --> 2310.4
so learn

2309.119 --> 2313.2000000000003
the lesson

2310.4 --> 2314.88
the existential consequences if you know

2313.2 --> 2317.2799999999997
it's gonna grow worse and worse and

2314.88 --> 2319.359
worse and nothing is stopping it

2317.28 --> 2321.8390000000004
then you know where it's gonna end and

2319.359 --> 2324.7999999999997
then you know that just bracing and

2321.839 --> 2327.2799999999997
complaining about it is not

2324.8 --> 2330.32
gonna lead you to a good end result

2327.28 --> 2330.32
that's my point

2330.72 --> 2334.16
and yeah building

2332.72 --> 2336.56
doing your own thing is a good

2334.16 --> 2339.52
alternative it's a better alternative

2336.56 --> 2341.52
it'll keep you clear-minded

2339.52 --> 2343.599
more in tune with logos

2341.52 --> 2345.44
but even then

2343.599 --> 2349.119
like

2345.44 --> 2351.68
the beast still grows stronger

2349.119 --> 2353.6800000000003
it does because of all the people that

2351.68 --> 2355.68
are faltering that are weakening

2353.68 --> 2357.44
becoming more dependent even medically

2355.68 --> 2359.839
dependent

2357.44 --> 2361.92
that's going to be a thing it's going to

2359.839 --> 2365.2
grow bigger and then it's going to grow

2361.92 --> 2367.839
bolder and then at some point it will go

2365.2 --> 2369.04
after you and your hut somewhere in the

2367.839 --> 2370.72
forest

2369.04 --> 2372.32
even though you're literally nobody's

2370.72 --> 2375.52
way because

2372.32 --> 2377.76
they don't want anybody to be allowed

2375.52 --> 2380.96
outside of it

2377.76 --> 2383.44
they'll just start demanding that

2380.96 --> 2385.76
for no logical reason

2383.44 --> 2389.52
because they don't need logic anymore

2385.76 --> 2394.0
they just want power no matter what

2389.52 --> 2394.0
against all odds against all reason

2394.079 --> 2398.4
and just building on your own well

2396.079 --> 2400.6400000000003
unless you're literally going to be able

2398.4 --> 2400.64
to

2401.92 --> 2405.76
grow

2403.2 --> 2408.72
your own military which is like kind of

2405.76 --> 2408.7200000000003
a bizarre idea

2408.96 --> 2411.839
no

2412.56 --> 2418.319
they're kind of yeah it in my

2415.839 --> 2421.2799999999997
philosophical opinion it's better to

2418.319 --> 2423.359
actually just end that game

2421.28 --> 2425.2000000000003
get in there

2423.359 --> 2428.56
with force

2425.2 --> 2431.04
organized force people lots of people

2428.56 --> 2433.44
and you have to know who are good and

2431.04 --> 2435.92
who are going to be on your side also to

2433.44 --> 2437.68
prevent clashes and just lots of

2435.92 --> 2440.319
bloodshed

2437.68 --> 2442.8799999999997
and then get

2440.319 --> 2444.16
the rotten apples out out of the system

2442.88 --> 2446.319
out of the

2444.16 --> 2449.2799999999997
the judicial system

2446.319 --> 2453.599
out of the political system

2449.28 --> 2455.52
out of the media yeah media dude

2453.599 --> 2457.2000000000003
they're not media anymore they're

2455.52 --> 2460.16
political agents

2457.2 --> 2462.16
blatantly right so it's not oh

2460.16 --> 2465.7599999999998
journalist no you're not [ __ ]

2462.16 --> 2467.92
journalists cnn you pieces of [ __ ] you

2465.76 --> 2470.96
are not journalists you don't have that

2467.92 --> 2473.119
right you can bluff that you don't your

2470.96 --> 2476.319
political agents and everybody in the

2473.119 --> 2476.319
[ __ ] world knows it

2476.4 --> 2485.119
and that's just one group it's vast

2480.56 --> 2486.0789999999997
the media polit the politicized media is

2485.119 --> 2488.079
big

2486.079 --> 2490.7200000000003
and cancerous

2488.079 --> 2495.28
and there's more coming out and it's

2490.72 --> 2498.319
they're getting like [ __ ] loads of money

2495.28 --> 2500.079
from the yeah the ones that that run

2498.319 --> 2501.839
this whole thing

2500.079 --> 2503.76
so they're all

2501.839 --> 2506.48
criminally compliant and they're not

2503.76 --> 2506.48
journalists

2507.359 --> 2512.48
right so politics judicial system

2510.56 --> 2515.52
journalists

2512.48 --> 2518.16
right and after that

2515.52 --> 2519.68
after that's done then yeah i guess what

2518.16 --> 2522.319
corporations are going to have to

2519.68 --> 2524.7999999999997
reconsider their position yeah we know

2522.319 --> 2526.88
yeah it's been all so convenient for you

2524.8 --> 2528.7200000000003
hasn't it

2526.88 --> 2530.6400000000003
yeah

2528.72 --> 2532.0789999999997
that's gonna end

2530.64 --> 2535.5989999999997
it has to

2532.079 --> 2537.6800000000003
because you can't have a undead

2535.599 --> 2541.119
at the at the helm

2537.68 --> 2543.04
of this whole thing you can't do that

2541.119 --> 2545.04
they're a moral

2543.04 --> 2546.72
they have no sympathy

2545.04 --> 2549.119
naturally because of the corporate

2546.72 --> 2551.839
nature

2549.119 --> 2551.839
right anyway

2567.839 --> 2570.16
wow

2571.2 --> 2574.72
you don't seem to care

2573.04 --> 2576.4
whatever

2574.72 --> 2579.839
talking about other stuff is getting a

2576.4 --> 2579.839
little too intense i guess

2601.44 --> 2605.7200000000003
right so yeah that's on my mind

2608.16 --> 2610.8799999999997
how do we

2611.92 --> 2618.079
not just make sure the body survives

2615.68 --> 2620.3999999999996
talking about humanity and the world as

2618.079 --> 2622.5600000000004
a whole not just make sure the body

2620.4 --> 2624.88
survives right you need

2622.56 --> 2626.24
the stem cells for that

2624.88 --> 2628.319
and the stem cell is going to be a

2626.24 --> 2630.64
metaphor for

2628.319 --> 2632.56
uh well

2630.64 --> 2635.7599999999998
people that build it

2632.56 --> 2638.72
that actually go grassroots that

2635.76 --> 2640.5600000000004
start their own families

2638.72 --> 2643.52
start farms

2640.56 --> 2645.359
get into like barter trade like those

2643.52 --> 2647.04
are the stem cells that we need to

2645.359 --> 2648.96
survive right

2647.04 --> 2651.839
but at the meantime

2648.96 --> 2654.2400000000002
that's this disease

2651.839 --> 2656.0
especially on the mind

2654.24 --> 2657.9199999999996
yeah as long as it

2656.0 --> 2659.68
is allowed to get worse and worse and

2657.92 --> 2662.8
worse you can have all the stem cells in

2659.68 --> 2665.2799999999997
the body you like you're gonna just like

2662.8 --> 2668.48
get yourself killed

2665.28 --> 2668.48
it's gonna go too far

2669.76 --> 2673.5200000000004
it has to be

2671.28 --> 2676.48
stopped with action because it's never

2673.52 --> 2677.7599999999998
gonna naturally stop

2676.48 --> 2680.48
it's like

2677.76 --> 2681.599
hysterical person like they need a slap

2680.48 --> 2683.359
in the face

2681.599 --> 2687.4
they need physical action to have

2683.359 --> 2687.4
themselves to be stopped

2699.68 --> 2703.5989999999997
pure blood needs to be a serious

2702.079 --> 2704.88
movement

2703.599 --> 2707.52
or

2704.88 --> 2707.52
i don't know

2708.16 --> 2713.24
it's just counter vaccine movement right

2719.52 --> 2723.04
right well the whole vaccination the

2722.0 --> 2726.56
whole

2723.04 --> 2729.119
mind control corruption medical system

2726.56 --> 2731.359
which is a big part of it unfortunately

2729.119 --> 2734.079
very big part probably even like the

2731.359 --> 2735.04
central part

2734.079 --> 2738.6400000000003
yeah

2735.04 --> 2741.52
it has to be removed from world society

2738.64 --> 2744.16
world society

2741.52 --> 2747.7599999999998
it's like necromancy it's basically evil

2744.16 --> 2749.1189999999997
magic that's integrated

2747.76 --> 2754.6400000000003
covertly

2749.119 --> 2754.6400000000003
for a long time guys a long time

2754.96 --> 2761.28
like people have grown up in its spell

2758.079 --> 2763.119
assuming it was real

2761.28 --> 2766.0
a lot

2763.119 --> 2768.7200000000003
it's a curse it needs to be removed the

2766.0 --> 2768.72
entire thing

2771.359 --> 2777.119
i mean we need doctors but we also need

2774.319 --> 2780.4
a serious overhaul of just medical

2777.119 --> 2781.92
knowledge in general and take a look

2780.4 --> 2785.44
like a new

2781.92 --> 2786.64
re-studying of what bacteria actually

2785.44 --> 2789.04
are

2786.64 --> 2789.839
and viruses supposedly

2789.04 --> 2791.7599999999998
like

2789.839 --> 2793.7599999999998
a fundamental

2791.76 --> 2797.2000000000003
revisitation

2793.76 --> 2799.599
not just oh was this virus that or that

2797.2 --> 2802.0
did it really do that detail no just

2799.599 --> 2803.28
like is the entire premise actually

2802.0 --> 2806.48
correct

2803.28 --> 2806.48
because i don't think it is

2807.2 --> 2812.16
a new medical

2809.119 --> 2813.839
knowledge basis for the world

2812.16 --> 2815.68
for doctors

2813.839 --> 2817.839
something they can actually trust not

2815.68 --> 2820.8799999999997
just

2817.839 --> 2824.04
spells to keep people bound

2820.88 --> 2824.04
and dependent

2833.92 --> 2837.079
all right

2846.72 --> 2850.64
oh stem cells must come from ante yeah i

2848.88 --> 2854.96
wasn't literally talking about stem

2850.64 --> 2854.96
cells it was actually a metaphor but yes

2855.599 --> 2858.8
right

2856.72 --> 2861.9199999999996
but i also call it the stem cells

2858.8 --> 2861.92
because it is like the

2863.2 --> 2868.72
may yeah being healthy eating healthy

2865.599 --> 2871.44
avoiding medical

2868.72 --> 2873.2
garbage and poison

2871.44 --> 2875.28
and like getting the kids and then

2873.2 --> 2878.5589999999997
having the fresh batch

2875.28 --> 2880.559
not for a literal stem cell harvesting

2878.559 --> 2882.8
you

2880.559 --> 2885.8390000000004
who knows

2882.8 --> 2886.6400000000003
not the way that's happening right now

2885.839 --> 2889.119
but

2886.64 --> 2890.4
like in the hole like they're they're

2889.119 --> 2892.7200000000003
literally

2890.4 --> 2895.28
full of stem cells

2892.72 --> 2898.319
they are sources of life

2895.28 --> 2902.88
like that will carry through the time

2898.319 --> 2904.079
they have still fresh growth in them

2902.88 --> 2906.88
that

2904.079 --> 2909.52
while everybody might like oh

2906.88 --> 2912.0
i'm like running out of juice running

2909.52 --> 2914.079
out of stem cells and dying because i

2912.0 --> 2916.24
was stupid enough to take like four

2914.079 --> 2917.8390000000004
shots

2916.24 --> 2919.2799999999997
well

2917.839 --> 2921.92
yeah as they all

2919.28 --> 2924.8
fade out that there will still be enough

2921.92 --> 2927.76
sprouts around enough people that can

2924.8 --> 2930.48
still grow the length even as everything

2927.76 --> 2933.119
around them is dying you need life force

2930.48 --> 2935.839
for that you need life force and will

2933.119 --> 2937.2000000000003
that comes with it to actually be able

2935.839 --> 2940.4
to just

2937.2 --> 2943.5989999999997
let it all happen and not like get

2940.4 --> 2945.599
pulled in and die from grief of seeing

2943.599 --> 2947.2000000000003
all that especially if you're young and

2945.599 --> 2949.44
innocent

2947.2 --> 2949.4399999999996
right

2949.599 --> 2954.6400000000003
you need life force and will

2952.319 --> 2958.72
to get through that to want to live

2954.64 --> 2958.72
despite everything dying around you

2958.8 --> 2962.88
you need

2960.48 --> 2964.72
well the pure blood i guess

2962.88 --> 2966.4
it's important

2964.72 --> 2970.24
because yeah that's still gonna happen

2966.4 --> 2973.359
guys it's already too late

2970.24 --> 2975.359
like people are dropping here and there

2973.359 --> 2979.44
and like in the sports you see it

2975.359 --> 2982.0
happening a lot now oh guess what

2979.44 --> 2984.48
that's just the start

2982.0 --> 2985.52
how many times aren't you gonna see them

2984.48 --> 2988.72
drop

2985.52 --> 2991.28
i mean i see ambulances like go around

2988.72 --> 2993.7599999999998
here regularly now

2991.28 --> 2996.3190000000004
i i literally when i went for groceries

2993.76 --> 2998.2400000000002
yesterday on my bike

2996.319 --> 3000.5589999999997
as like an ambulance came by and

2998.24 --> 3002.8799999999997
literally hurt somebody

3000.559 --> 3004.8
that i just happened to be

3002.88 --> 3006.079
standing next to waiting for the traffic

3004.8 --> 3007.04
light

3006.079 --> 3010.4
say

3007.04 --> 3010.4
ah another one

3011.44 --> 3015.359
like whoa

3013.359 --> 3018.24
so that literally happens all the time

3015.359 --> 3021.119
then yeah it does because

3018.24 --> 3025.4799999999996
they're all now dropping dead

3021.119 --> 3025.48
all the ones that just took it

3026.64 --> 3031.2
and then as i

3028.48 --> 3033.119
went off i said that around like yeah i

3031.2 --> 3035.5989999999997
wasn't mad enough to just say to their

3033.119 --> 3037.2000000000003
face i guess i was i didn't want to have

3035.599 --> 3039.6800000000003
like a conversation on the middle of the

3037.2 --> 3041.2
bike road

3039.68 --> 3044.0789999999997
just said like yeah they shouldn't have

3041.2 --> 3044.0789999999997
taken the shot

3045.76 --> 3048.76
right

3056.96 --> 3060.88
vex

3058.0 --> 3063.52
can't give blood

3060.88 --> 3066.88
yeah serious blood shortage that's right

3063.52 --> 3069.2
well until it will just be

3066.88 --> 3071.359
the yeah oh the medical system doing it

3069.2 --> 3072.7999999999997
wrong who could see that coming yeah at

3071.359 --> 3075.5989999999997
some point they're just going to say no

3072.8 --> 3076.88
no you can give blood as after with the

3075.599 --> 3078.4
v

3076.88 --> 3079.44
and then who knows maybe they'll get to

3078.4 --> 3082.64
the point

3079.44 --> 3086.0
you can only get

3082.64 --> 3087.92
v blood like you're not allowed to sell

3086.0 --> 3088.88
your blood anymore if you didn't get the

3087.92 --> 3089.76
v

3088.88 --> 3092.0
yeah

3089.76 --> 3094.6400000000003
oh you think that's crazy you think they

3092.0 --> 3097.92
won't do that

3094.64 --> 3100.48
you think you think they won't do that

3097.92 --> 3102.7200000000003
think again you should know better by

3100.48 --> 3102.72
now

3104.559 --> 3108.3190000000004
like

3106.72 --> 3111.4399999999996
that whole

3108.319 --> 3113.839
blood banks

3111.44 --> 3115.359
that's under the control of the medical

3113.839 --> 3116.48
system guys

3115.359 --> 3120.319
that's

3116.48 --> 3122.2400000000002
big corp medical

3120.319 --> 3124.96
that's not just like

3122.24 --> 3125.9199999999996
your local government

3124.96 --> 3127.68
that

3125.92 --> 3129.92
stores it for you

3127.68 --> 3132.5589999999997
that regulates that no that's part of

3129.92 --> 3133.359
the medical industry

3132.559 --> 3136.079
it's

3133.359 --> 3138.7999999999997
gonna be pulled right with the craziness

3136.079 --> 3142.28
right with the the death system

3138.8 --> 3142.28
the death policies

3163.119 --> 3167.2000000000003
they see it now that's cool slow mo moon

3165.2 --> 3169.68
buggy

3167.2 --> 3171.1189999999997
well you'd have to be like willingly

3169.68 --> 3174.0789999999997
ignorant

3171.119 --> 3177.76
based on the inability to handle it to

3174.079 --> 3177.76
even not see it anymore now

3178.559 --> 3183.119
it's like wake up

3180.4 --> 3185.52
or die or rather

3183.119 --> 3188.76
be enslaved and then risk dying on the

3185.52 --> 3188.7599999999998
long run

3240.8 --> 3243.8
huh

3259.68 --> 3265.52
right well getting inspector

3263.28 --> 3267.119
the weak get it

3265.52 --> 3270.0
the weak that

3267.119 --> 3272.6400000000003
do not have the faculties the abilities

3270.0 --> 3274.72
or the proper social circles with people

3272.64 --> 3276.16
that warn them because they avoid that

3274.72 --> 3277.7599999999998
because they don't want to know because

3276.16 --> 3279.5989999999997
they're weak

3277.76 --> 3281.6800000000003
those are the ones that are just gonna

3279.599 --> 3283.52
like still be under like

3281.68 --> 3285.68
90s

3283.52 --> 3287.44
style assumption like yeah it's still

3285.68 --> 3289.44
pretty safe the medical system is still

3287.44 --> 3291.76
good they're still just gonna operate

3289.44 --> 3295.76
like that's still reality

3291.76 --> 3297.3590000000004
and that's how the they then like yeah

3295.76 --> 3298.1600000000003
no it isn't

3297.359 --> 3300.4
and

3298.16 --> 3302.319
you're literally just allowing yourself

3300.4 --> 3304.88
to be

3302.319 --> 3307.92
devastatingly poisoned

3304.88 --> 3310.799
because you believe

3307.92 --> 3314.0
the system is still good

3310.799 --> 3316.559
because you're weak you don't see it

3314.0 --> 3320.559
and you avoid people that try to warn

3316.559 --> 3323.119
you that see it and then yeah

3320.559 --> 3325.6800000000003
you're now captured by the beast

3323.119 --> 3328.6800000000003
and the beast is gonna kill you

3325.68 --> 3328.68
slowly

3339.04 --> 3343.92
right it's like

3341.68 --> 3346.64
the war is already here and if you don't

3343.92 --> 3349.839
see that it's already here then you fall

3346.64 --> 3349.839
victim to the war

3361.76 --> 3366.559
which by the way is even the universal

3364.72 --> 3367.4399999999996
problem with corruption

3366.559 --> 3369.0400000000004
right

3367.44 --> 3371.68
because what is corruption it's the

3369.04 --> 3375.2
corrupting of things those things might

3371.68 --> 3377.2
be great for a long time

3375.2 --> 3380.0789999999997
then you get a whole bunch of people

3377.2 --> 3382.72
that start to rely on that on an

3380.079 --> 3384.2400000000002
intuitive level like these are good this

3382.72 --> 3386.3999999999996
is good

3384.24 --> 3388.0
but if it then suddenly changes and

3386.4 --> 3390.2400000000002
shifts and corrupts starts act

3388.0 --> 3392.88
differently then there will be plenty of

3390.24 --> 3395.359
people that simply will not be able to

3392.88 --> 3398.48
handle that change and they will still

3395.359 --> 3401.2
operate under the guise that it is not

3398.48 --> 3402.079
corrupted because they literally deny

3401.2 --> 3407.04
that

3402.079 --> 3407.04
and that denial can carry very long

3407.52 --> 3411.04
and that's

3408.88 --> 3413.2000000000003
kind of the situation we're in right now

3411.04 --> 3416.64
in a big way

3413.2 --> 3419.1189999999997
the whole system was pretty decent okay

3416.64 --> 3421.68
it had problems but it was good with

3419.119 --> 3423.44
good people in place that seemed to know

3421.68 --> 3425.52
moral

3423.44 --> 3428.4
morals and all that what what is right

3425.52 --> 3431.2
what is wrong and everybody grew up in

3428.4 --> 3434.0
just like yeah we can trust it

3431.2 --> 3436.0789999999997
well when it then suddenly shifts around

3434.0 --> 3440.0
it's kind of starting with 9 11 getting

3436.079 --> 3440.0
a lot worse so after that

3440.559 --> 3444.88
there was just people that just every

3442.64 --> 3446.4
step of the corruption like nah

3444.88 --> 3448.559
that's okay

3446.4 --> 3450.64
it's just temporary ah no that's

3448.559 --> 3451.92
nonsense you're just conspiracy theories

3450.64 --> 3454.4
nah

3451.92 --> 3457.44
you're just afraid you're racist look

3454.4 --> 3459.52
how crazy it got

3457.44 --> 3461.68
but it's all started with just the

3459.52 --> 3462.559
denial of the corruption of the whole

3461.68 --> 3466.24
thing

3462.559 --> 3468.799
that you grew up leaning on so heavily

3466.24 --> 3470.319
it needed to be like a divine foundation

3468.799 --> 3472.88
you could trust and then when it

3470.319 --> 3474.64
corrupted you lost that foundation and

3472.88 --> 3476.079
you didn't know where to go

3474.64 --> 3478.799
spiritually

3476.079 --> 3480.7200000000003
so you just doubled down and ignored the

3478.799 --> 3482.4
corruption

3480.72 --> 3484.8799999999997
well that enslaves you now you're

3482.4 --> 3489.1600000000003
subjected to its corruption and the

3484.88 --> 3489.1600000000003
programming that comes with it

3505.76 --> 3508.079
hmm

3510.559 --> 3513.28
it's a trap

3515.599 --> 3519.28
not to go over to the light when i die

3518.16 --> 3521.2
dude

3519.28 --> 3523.52
you really think that the choice of

3521.2 --> 3527.64
going towards or away from the light is

3523.52 --> 3527.64
gonna matter after you die

3530.88 --> 3534.7200000000003
i think it's more important like what

3532.96 --> 3537.04
you sense

3534.72 --> 3538.9599999999996
the frequency of the light is right the

3537.04 --> 3540.16
light might simply be

3538.96 --> 3543.52
like a

3540.16 --> 3547.359
a spirit being on the other side that's

3543.52 --> 3549.839
offering shelter to you as a spirit

3547.359 --> 3553.5989999999997
like like a tree

3549.839 --> 3556.4
offering room to hang a christmas bulb

3553.599 --> 3556.4
metaphorically

3557.599 --> 3563.04
so yeah is the frequency of that light

3560.24 --> 3566.0
right does it feel right

3563.04 --> 3568.48
then why wouldn't you go

3566.0 --> 3572.359
how would you know it matters

3568.48 --> 3572.359
you're not alive anymore

3582.48 --> 3585.44
you don't want to come back to this hell

3584.24 --> 3587.839
hole

3585.44 --> 3587.839
all right

3594.16 --> 3598.839
right well maybe after death you'll

3595.92 --> 3602.64
change your mind maybe the hell

3598.839 --> 3603.68
hole part that you're now forced to deal

3602.64 --> 3605.92
with

3603.68 --> 3608.799
you will miss

3605.92 --> 3611.2000000000003
because there would be no such

3608.799 --> 3612.96
sensations in any form and maybe you'll

3611.2 --> 3614.799
miss it maybe you'll miss

3612.96 --> 3618.839
what it actually does to you on the

3614.799 --> 3618.839
other side you don't know

3628.079 --> 3631.599
right maybe

3629.44 --> 3633.839
if you're released from all the burdens

3631.599 --> 3635.52
that you're carrying in your life

3633.839 --> 3639.92
because of death

3635.52 --> 3642.4
maybe afterward you'll be so relieved

3639.92 --> 3643.92
that you'll be like man i can't wait to

3642.4 --> 3646.799
do this again

3643.92 --> 3646.799
how do you know

3651.2 --> 3654.5989999999997
how do you know

3671.359 --> 3676.319
maybe i figure when i die

3674.24 --> 3677.839
there's a light not going towards it all

3676.319 --> 3680.88
right well

3677.839 --> 3682.64
sure well by my lord

3680.88 --> 3685.28
that that basically means you're just

3682.64 --> 3689.2
gonna dwell here

3685.28 --> 3690.799
you're gonna dwell in the dark world

3689.2 --> 3692.72
for a while

3690.799 --> 3695.28
but eventually that light's gonna get

3692.72 --> 3695.2799999999997
you anyway

3695.359 --> 3700.68
like you will be collected it happens

3713.92 --> 3716.92
uh

3728.16 --> 3734.5589999999997
well pg crew shank i get that

3731.92 --> 3736.799
but i think that

3734.559 --> 3739.119
everybody's gonna die that always

3736.799 --> 3740.64
happens it's part of life

3739.119 --> 3743.2000000000003
and i think that

3740.64 --> 3745.0389999999998
the preponderance of our fair

3743.2 --> 3748.24
experiences

3745.039 --> 3749.8390000000004
and our like impulse our physical nature

3748.24 --> 3750.64
against it and

3749.839 --> 3753.2799999999997
like

3750.64 --> 3755.92
the fair cycles all that

3753.28 --> 3758.2400000000002
that that is much worse than actual

3755.92 --> 3758.2400000000002
death

3758.96 --> 3761.76
when it happens

3762.799 --> 3767.839
so yeah

3764.88 --> 3769.76
like the amount of fear of death you can

3767.839 --> 3771.44
experience in your life

3769.76 --> 3774.92
is probably going to be more than the

3771.44 --> 3774.92
actual death

3789.039 --> 3792.4
all right but i used to have that a lot

3791.039 --> 3796.039
too

3792.4 --> 3796.039
i ignore it now

3804.16 --> 3807.44
you are unaware of 99 what is going on

3806.4 --> 3810.2400000000002
around you

3807.44 --> 3811.33
well that all depends on how much detail

3810.24 --> 3812.5589999999997
you ascribe to

3811.33 --> 3815.119
[Music]

3812.559 --> 3816.7200000000003
what you can figure out should be around

3815.119 --> 3819.119
you

3816.72 --> 3821.7599999999998
right like a fractal pattern that's how

3819.119 --> 3824.799
i see everything including people like

3821.76 --> 3827.76
every time i see a person i very quickly

3824.799 --> 3830.319
realize that they have an entire life of

3827.76 --> 3832.1600000000003
thinking and experience and reflecting

3830.319 --> 3833.68
that's going to follow certain patterns

3832.16 --> 3836.24
naturally

3833.68 --> 3838.3999999999996
based on their frequency and who is who

3836.24 --> 3841.52
is around them like i literally just by

3838.4 --> 3843.6800000000003
a single glance realize that's an entire

3841.52 --> 3845.44
person just like me

3843.68 --> 3848.0
that will have like a lot of

3845.44 --> 3850.16
considerations to reflect upon just like

3848.0 --> 3850.16
me

3851.2 --> 3856.5589999999997
so if you just see that with one person

3853.599 --> 3858.0
then realize yeah now take that times

3856.559 --> 3860.4
billions

3858.0 --> 3862.48
and realize they're all individuals that

3860.4 --> 3864.839
all have experiences and things to

3862.48 --> 3869.2
reflect upon

3864.839 --> 3869.2
how like the amount

3869.44 --> 3874.359
of data is just

3871.359 --> 3874.359
overwhelming

3885.92 --> 3890.559
and that's just humans

3888.319 --> 3893.5589999999997
i even have that with animals and plants

3890.559 --> 3893.559
sometimes

3894.96 --> 3898.16
like you can look at a tree and just see

3896.64 --> 3900.0789999999997
oh yeah that's a tree and you can look

3898.16 --> 3902.16
at a tree and then think like what it

3900.079 --> 3903.92
was it be like for that tree

3902.16 --> 3908.24
and i realized that it

3903.92 --> 3910.0
too started out this is seed or sprout

3908.24 --> 3912.319
and that it grows and that it's probably

3910.0 --> 3914.319
going to keep on growing and then

3912.319 --> 3916.48
try to imagine what it's like for the

3914.319 --> 3918.0
tree for everything around it to change

3916.48 --> 3921.039
as rapidly as

3918.0 --> 3921.039
they typically do

3921.52 --> 3926.88
sitting through all that

3924.16 --> 3928.72
from the perspective of a tree

3926.88 --> 3930.4
and then not getting super super

3928.72 --> 3932.9599999999996
dramatic about because it knows it's a

3930.4 --> 3934.839
tree it knows it has little influence

3932.96 --> 3937.76
except for its

3934.839 --> 3940.96
presence the oxygen

3937.76 --> 3940.96
that it can give the world

3942.319 --> 3947.68
right and that's just a tree how many

3944.64 --> 3949.5989999999997
trees are there in the world

3947.68 --> 3951.839
hundreds of billions

3949.599 --> 3951.839
yeah

3952.72 --> 3957.2
it's just

3953.76 --> 3957.2000000000003
it's all a fractal pattern

3957.76 --> 3964.4
you don't have to have direct access to

3960.72 --> 3966.72
every detail to know exactly how it all

3964.4 --> 3966.7200000000003
works

3966.799 --> 3970.559
intuitively roughly to see the fractal

3969.52 --> 3972.64
pattern

3970.559 --> 3975.119
and then you zoom in on something and

3972.64 --> 3977.359
then you'll find yeah i i sized up the

3975.119 --> 3979.2000000000003
fractal pattern of that which i didn't

3977.359 --> 3980.72
actively know

3979.2 --> 3983.0389999999998
correctly

3980.72 --> 3985.839
because when i approached it yeah

3983.039 --> 3988.48
the details certainly did fit

3985.839 --> 3990.48
cohesively and consistently and it

3988.48 --> 3993.599
resonates with other situations where

3990.48 --> 3995.839
that happened too and then you know

3993.599 --> 3998.079
your skeletal approach of the entire

3995.839 --> 4002.0
thing is correct

3998.079 --> 4004.48
the dynamics are correct

4002.0 --> 4007.119
you don't have to actually know all the

4004.48 --> 4010.64
details

4007.119 --> 4015.039
you just need to know enough of them

4010.64 --> 4015.0389999999998
to see the pattern of the details

4015.52 --> 4019.0
fractal thinking

4057.44 --> 4063.4
nde

4059.359 --> 4063.4
near death experience right

4094.0 --> 4097.0
okay

4112.719 --> 4115.92
man it's getting dark here

4117.199 --> 4124.839
yeah now it's got yeah i just got yellow

4121.04 --> 4124.839
i'm yellow though

4142.719 --> 4146.199
no there isn't

4170.159 --> 4175.839
huh really dx

4173.12 --> 4175.839
all right

4201.92 --> 4204.2390000000005
huh

4204.96 --> 4209.76
all right jeff gas said that's

4207.6 --> 4212.92
that's interesting

4209.76 --> 4212.92
i guess

4227.84 --> 4233.679
what are you talking about

4230.719 --> 4233.679
seeking star wars

4234.159 --> 4237.159
one

4258.96 --> 4261.6
oh dear

4262.64 --> 4269.56
okay i'll just leave you guys

4266.32 --> 4269.5599999999995
to that

4278.8 --> 4282.719
who are the people in my audience

4283.76 --> 4287.84
i think i have a whole bunch of people

4288.32 --> 4297.0
like in their 50s and 60s

4292.239 --> 4297.0
my audience and that's perfectly fine

4306.719 --> 4310.88
i don't know what it is maybe he's like

4310.96 --> 4315.679
people in their 20s or that maybe i

4313.679 --> 4318.159
don't appeal to them maybe i have not

4315.679 --> 4320.88
conformed to their

4318.159 --> 4323.36
mandatory mind control format that

4320.88 --> 4324.719
they've been subjected to in schools and

4323.36 --> 4326.719
all that

4324.719 --> 4331.92
so that i'm not compatible and they just

4326.719 --> 4334.64
like oh no he is like the old ways

4331.92 --> 4337.4400000000005
i don't like it i'm looking for somebody

4334.64 --> 4338.8
with that programmed quirkiness type of

4337.44 --> 4341.919999999999
thing

4338.8 --> 4344.0
that i grew up with and i'm projecting

4341.92 --> 4345.76
on the world that that everybody is like

4344.0 --> 4348.08
that i don't know

4345.76 --> 4351.1990000000005
maybe i'm wrong i don't are do i have

4348.08 --> 4351.199
young listeners here

4352.56 --> 4358.2390000000005
except for trolls that is

4356.4 --> 4359.5199999999995
or maybe they're all just being kept

4358.239 --> 4362.4
away

4359.52 --> 4364.080000000001
maybe i only appear on recommendations

4362.4 --> 4367.28
from people certain

4364.08 --> 4371.84
age category i don't know what it is

4367.28 --> 4371.84
you're in late 20s all right dx okay

4378.719 --> 4383.4
usually wrong what are you saying

4407.679 --> 4410.679
so

4412.48 --> 4417.759999999999
all right yeah who are you talking to

4414.08 --> 4419.44
north narnia you troll

4417.76 --> 4421.52
right

4419.44 --> 4423.759999999999
not even saying hello just

4421.52 --> 4427.0
starting with usually wrong so what does

4423.76 --> 4427.0
that mean

4435.44 --> 4439.759999999999
oh oh wait you did spray speak up

4437.36 --> 4442.4
earlier what we're all going to die what

4439.76 --> 4442.400000000001
the [ __ ]

4448.159 --> 4454.12
any goals or changes for you

4451.12 --> 4454.12
uh

4457.679 --> 4460.4800000000005
oh actually

4462.32 --> 4468.04
no this is

4465.04 --> 4468.04
barely

4475.36 --> 4477.759999999999
i mean

4480.4 --> 4483.679
right kind of the same program that's

4482.8 --> 4487.04
been

4483.679 --> 4489.1990000000005
that i've been at it for a while

4487.04 --> 4490.88
i mean i do hope that my financial

4489.199 --> 4494.839999999999
situation just

4490.88 --> 4497.6
finally like really gets

4494.84 --> 4500.719
better i mean i'm getting great support

4497.6 --> 4503.04
and i'm i'm managing to to keep afloat

4500.719 --> 4505.04
thanks to well the show and your you

4503.04 --> 4507.92
guys support me

4505.04 --> 4510.719
you guys supporting me that's working

4507.92 --> 4513.1990000000005
but i'm not literally like

4510.719 --> 4515.44
growing out of the situation and i want

4513.199 --> 4515.44
that

4516.96 --> 4524.2390000000005
to at least like make some headway

4521.6 --> 4526.4800000000005
i don't just want to be stuck in this

4524.239 --> 4528.718999999999
exact setup

4526.48 --> 4531.678999999999
for like 10 years or something that's

4528.719 --> 4531.679
that's stupid

4533.36 --> 4539.32
i have more things i could do and want

4536.239 --> 4539.32
to do

4546.48 --> 4549.919999999999
you could try and take steps towards

4548.48 --> 4551.5199999999995
improving your yeah what do you think

4549.92 --> 4554.88
i'm doing

4551.52 --> 4554.88
i'm not praying for it

4555.28 --> 4559.44
look i have other things still running

4557.52 --> 4561.84
right i have the gti i haven't even

4559.44 --> 4563.919999999999
mentioned that for over a year now

4561.84 --> 4567.12
because like it seemed like it got

4563.92 --> 4569.1990000000005
completely grabbled like suddenly ever

4567.12 --> 4572.48
all that everything that was made it

4569.199 --> 4576.239
great suddenly all just went to [ __ ]

4572.48 --> 4578.4
but it's been turning around again

4576.239 --> 4578.4
so

4579.28 --> 4585.199
it's just that it wasn't as predictable

4582.32 --> 4587.679
and reliable as i thought but

4585.199 --> 4589.599999999999
i'm still i haven't actually thrown

4587.679 --> 4591.28
money at it or anything not that like

4589.6 --> 4593.4400000000005
that at all

4591.28 --> 4593.44
but

4593.52 --> 4598.0
it's producing

4595.28 --> 4601.44
virtual stuff again and i might be able

4598.0 --> 4604.48
to actually use it now at some point if

4601.44 --> 4607.04
i could just get myself to really figure

4604.48 --> 4609.199
out how it all works

4607.04 --> 4611.28
because i keep on stumbling i feel again

4609.199 --> 4613.44
like a grandpa

4611.28 --> 4616.8
that's like

4613.44 --> 4618.5599999999995
i'm trying to move the mouse

4616.8 --> 4622.2390000000005
that's what it feels like to me when i

4618.56 --> 4622.2390000000005
deal with like crypto [ __ ]

4625.199 --> 4627.919999999999
so yeah

4629.44 --> 4635.0
thanks for the straw man

4631.679 --> 4635.0
that's fine

4639.199 --> 4643.5599999999995
praying for money is not a good idea

4653.12 --> 4658.5599999999995
yeah now it's better to pray for release

4656.96 --> 4661.84
of darkness

4658.56 --> 4665.6
to let the dark pulses slide off if that

4661.84 --> 4667.52
happens like through restlessness or

4665.6 --> 4670.64
or some kind of

4667.52 --> 4672.320000000001
spell that's you suddenly absorbed

4670.64 --> 4673.92
because that does happen

4672.32 --> 4676.4
like you know

4673.92 --> 4679.6
they're trying they're being tricksy

4676.4 --> 4681.92
but sometimes it still like rubs off

4679.6 --> 4684.88
accidentally and then it's good to like

4681.92 --> 4687.679
pray to get that out of you again

4684.88 --> 4689.4400000000005
to like remember who you really are

4687.679 --> 4691.52
that's what i use prayer for and if you

4689.44 --> 4692.48
do that

4691.52 --> 4695.280000000001
then

4692.48 --> 4698.48
you can actually represent

4695.28 --> 4700.8
produce conversation understanding help

4698.48 --> 4703.04
people out and then hopefully

4700.8 --> 4705.12
that will make it worth that will keep

4703.04 --> 4708.48
people confident enough

4705.12 --> 4708.48
to then send me money

4709.44 --> 4714.0
right

4711.04 --> 4714.0
that's how i do it

4715.44 --> 4721.12
literally just praying

4717.44 --> 4724.0
straight for the end result is

4721.12 --> 4726.08
is a sign that you don't really want to

4724.0 --> 4727.84
address

4726.08 --> 4731.4
the real situation

4727.84 --> 4731.400000000001
i don't do that

4738.4 --> 4741.679
all right pj kershank don't worry about

4740.159 --> 4743.92
it

4741.679 --> 4746.159
it's a pretty good show

4743.92 --> 4749.84
yeah it might be worth watching it back

4746.159 --> 4749.839999999999
i might watch it back myself

4750.64 --> 4753.84
oh [ __ ] dx

4753.92 --> 4759.04
what

4756.159 --> 4759.04
you've lost it

4759.199 --> 4762.4
well

4760.159 --> 4763.679
have you tried looking

4762.4 --> 4768.239
in the couch

4763.679 --> 4768.2390000000005
maybe the usb stick is over there

4770.48 --> 4773.799999999999
damn bro

4777.36 --> 4782.48
that's probably not what you were

4779.6 --> 4784.96
intending to say but

4782.48 --> 4787.04
like what how does that even happen how

4784.96 --> 4790.0
do you just lose

4787.04 --> 4792.08
that

4790.0 --> 4794.719
and how the hell do you even have so

4792.08 --> 4796.32
much resources at that age

4794.719 --> 4798.8
sheesh

4796.32 --> 4798.799999999999
whatever

4802.239 --> 4805.839999999999
or did you just make that up

4822.08 --> 4824.48
what

4825.52 --> 4827.84
wow

4829.44 --> 4831.759999999999
that's

4831.84 --> 4836.719
that's idiotic i'm sorry yeah but you'll

4834.56 --> 4839.719
feel that too but jesus what the hell

4836.719 --> 4839.719
dude

4855.92 --> 4858.92
but

4862.719 --> 4865.52
dude i don't know

4866.239 --> 4871.678999999999
is there no way to literally contact

4868.239 --> 4872.48
protonmail and say like can you still

4871.679 --> 4874.32
like

4872.48 --> 4877.04
recover something for it or are they

4874.32 --> 4879.84
like literally they just wipe everything

4877.04 --> 4881.679
constantly to make room

4879.84 --> 4884.56
that's pretty messed up

4881.679 --> 4886.32
like why the hell would you ever use

4884.56 --> 4887.52
protonmail

4886.32 --> 4890.5599999999995
then

4887.52 --> 4895.040000000001
if it just auto deletes that's

4890.56 --> 4895.04
idiotic that's an idiotic system

4901.6 --> 4903.84
all right

4904.48 --> 4907.919999999999
so

4905.36 --> 4907.92
dx

4909.12 --> 4914.5599999999995
is it just protonmail or

4912.48 --> 4917.199
have you actually like

4914.56 --> 4921.120000000001
registered a personal

4917.199 --> 4922.5599999999995
like identity thing your social

4921.12 --> 4924.48
what is it

4922.56 --> 4926.639
yeah social code what the hell what do

4924.48 --> 4928.959999999999
you even call that

4926.639 --> 4930.8
your official registries information is

4928.96 --> 4932.56
there anything you could like tie it

4930.8 --> 4934.320000000001
back with and basically

4932.56 --> 4935.360000000001
get it back that way because otherwise

4934.32 --> 4938.32
it's just

4935.36 --> 4938.32
so messed up

4938.4 --> 4941.879999999999
it's just depressing

4944.639 --> 4951.4400000000005
same password yeah that's not gonna help

4948.239 --> 4953.599999999999
you have to have like yours your actual

4951.44 --> 4955.759999999999
officially registered personal

4953.6 --> 4956.8
information tied in with it if you have

4955.76 --> 4959.280000000001
that

4956.8 --> 4961.6
then even if you lose the email whatever

4959.28 --> 4964.08
you could just say look it's actually me

4961.6 --> 4966.0
i am the official owner

4964.08 --> 4968.5599999999995
right like that

4966.0 --> 4971.92
you could try it that route

4968.56 --> 4975.04
if you did if it's just no no just

4971.92 --> 4975.84
randomly only email nobody knows who i

4975.04 --> 4978.08
am

4975.84 --> 4981.04
yeah you just lost it and you'll never

4978.08 --> 4981.04
get it back ever

4981.28 --> 4985.36
if you don't tie it in with your

4982.719 --> 4987.12
personal information then you don't have

4985.36 --> 4989.28
it anymore

4987.12 --> 4993.12
because then it becomes as flimsy as

4989.28 --> 4995.679
flimsy as like oops i just lost my usb

4993.12 --> 4997.199
stick i accidentally dropped it in the

4995.679 --> 4999.1990000000005
sewers

4997.199 --> 5003.08
yeah it's gone

4999.199 --> 5003.08
you'll never see it again

5035.84 --> 5039.4400000000005
but you can't get the emo

5038.0 --> 5042.8
no but

5039.44 --> 5047.28
dude you need to prove to them

5042.8 --> 5047.28
your identity that your owner

5049.52 --> 5053.120000000001
like

5051.12 --> 5056.639
emails and passwords is just come

5053.12 --> 5058.8
irrelevant when it's gone it's gone

5056.639 --> 5059.6
but if you can still claim ownership

5058.8 --> 5063.12
through

5059.6 --> 5067.04
your your officially registered identity

5063.12 --> 5068.96
that might somehow still work out

5067.04 --> 5071.84
who knows maybe you could literally just

5068.96 --> 5073.52
claim maybe you could freaking i don't

5071.84 --> 5076.4800000000005
know probably not maybe you could sue

5073.52 --> 5078.080000000001
them just say like no

5076.48 --> 5080.718999999999
your

5078.08 --> 5082.4
system is too

5080.719 --> 5085.28
flimsy

5082.4 --> 5088.48
i shouldn't be like i i like

5085.28 --> 5091.199
accidentally got the email deleted

5088.48 --> 5093.12
your access is too flimsy

5091.199 --> 5094.0
i demand

5093.12 --> 5098.32
my

5094.0 --> 5100.08
what yeah what i know is mine back i

5098.32 --> 5102.639
don't know

5100.08 --> 5106.76
spitballing at this point dude i i'm not

5102.639 --> 5106.76
good at these types of things

5116.96 --> 5119.12
no

5119.92 --> 5125.28
no dx

5122.4 --> 5128.0
the only chance you have right now is to

5125.28 --> 5130.8
be able to judicially claim ownership of

5128.0 --> 5130.8
that bitcoin

5134.56 --> 5138.080000000001
like even though you don't if if it's

5136.719 --> 5140.88
purely

5138.08 --> 5144.0
anonymous and just

5140.88 --> 5146.32
mechanical access based yeah

5144.0 --> 5146.32
that's

5149.84 --> 5153.12
i don't know i don't want to talk about

5151.44 --> 5156.32
it anyways i find this extremely

5153.12 --> 5156.32
depressing thanks

5159.12 --> 5164.12
right okay well don't bring it up again

5172.4 --> 5175.4
uh

5195.679 --> 5200.0
i mean

5196.56 --> 5204.080000000001
you might still try what i said

5200.0 --> 5204.08
see if there is some way to do that

5204.4 --> 5208.679
or maybe you already tried that

5218.8 --> 5221.84
man can you imagine

5220.639 --> 5224.88
like how

5221.84 --> 5227.84
riddled with holes the the entire ledger

5224.88 --> 5230.96
is of bitcoin it's riddled with holes

5227.84 --> 5232.08
like maybe half of it is just gone

5230.96 --> 5234.8
like

5232.08 --> 5237.8
it no longer is accessible it's just

5234.8 --> 5237.8
gone

5238.719 --> 5245.52
forever no yeah so everybody can see

5242.48 --> 5249.04
like yeah it was generated but nobody

5245.52 --> 5249.040000000001
has access to it anymore

5250.639 --> 5253.84
it's

5251.6 --> 5253.84
bizarre

5266.639 --> 5271.1990000000005
huh you could give them well yeah gadget

5269.199 --> 5273.839999999999
inspector well yeah

5271.199 --> 5275.678999999999
that's right so

5273.84 --> 5277.92
you could set up

5275.679 --> 5280.159
like an investigational type of contract

5277.92 --> 5282.96
like hey i got this bitcoin i can't

5280.159 --> 5284.4
access if you can figure out how i can

5282.96 --> 5286.8
get it back

5284.4 --> 5289.199
then you you get like

5286.8 --> 5291.360000000001
five percent of the entire thing

5289.199 --> 5294.48
but if you don't get it back then you do

5291.36 --> 5297.28
i don't pay you right that might be

5294.48 --> 5297.28
worth a try

5299.36 --> 5304.679
anyway yeah

5301.679 --> 5304.679
just

5316.639 --> 5324.400000000001
yeah i'm sure dx well let's not

5320.8 --> 5324.400000000001
right i'm gonna round out the show

5326.8 --> 5332.0
because i find this very very

5329.28 --> 5334.32
frustrating subject like don't

5332.0 --> 5337.679
like i don't tell me about how you

5334.32 --> 5340.799999999999
freaking lost vast amounts of money yeah

5337.679 --> 5340.8
don't tell me about that

5341.679 --> 5346.08
unless you're still confident i can

5344.239 --> 5348.32
help you figure out how to get it back

5346.08 --> 5353.04
or something but i don't want to know

5348.32 --> 5353.04
right i find that terribly depressing

5360.88 --> 5364.1990000000005
so flimsy

5371.04 --> 5376.719
right so anyway i'll see you guys later

yeah it's okay dx is just that

5379.84 --> 5383.52
i gave you some tips that might be worth

5382.48 --> 5386.5599999999995
a shot

5383.52 --> 5388.080000000001
otherwise i can't help you and if

5386.56 --> 5390.320000000001
none of that works then i just don't

5388.08 --> 5393.639
want to know about this because it's

5390.32 --> 5393.639
super depressing
