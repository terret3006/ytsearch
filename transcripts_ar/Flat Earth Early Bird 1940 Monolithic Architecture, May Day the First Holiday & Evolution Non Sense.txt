107.02 --> 112.64
[Music]

109.88 --> 114.67999999999999
clouded though clouded it's a big word

112.64 --> 117.31
seems to be just like a big white Haze

114.68 --> 120.37
up there

117.31 --> 120.37
[Music]

124.36 --> 131.28
it probably could rain at some point

127.319 --> 135.31900000000002
but it's just overall nice and

131.28 --> 135.319
warm was a bit sunnier

140.56 --> 145.72
earlier all

142.72 --> 145.72
right

145.959 --> 151.84
so it is Monday the 6th of May 20

158.56 --> 165.84
24 oh

161.08 --> 165.84
temperature 20Â° C

166.0 --> 170.4
wow that's weird it doesn't feel like

171.0 --> 174.28
20Â° but I mean it does feel kind of nice

173.4 --> 180.36
and

174.28 --> 180.36
warm uh 49% humidity okay

184.799 --> 190.4
H

187.68 --> 192.28
right

190.4 --> 196.72
so I

192.28 --> 196.72
got taric coffee already

199.56 --> 206.56
here and Illuminati

202.56 --> 206.56
KAS nice

217.519 --> 222.59900000000002
yeah David Weiss sent me that video that

220.959 --> 225.519
he was talking

222.599 --> 227.64
about the night owl show about those

225.519 --> 230.439
Mega structures in

227.64 --> 233.48
China it is pretty

230.439 --> 234.519
wild like he was not exaggerating it is

233.48 --> 241.39999999999998
really

234.519 --> 241.4
wild and uh it's been amazing thus far

241.92 --> 245.51899999999998
I'm in 20 minutes and then yeah I had to

244.0 --> 248.56
start the

245.519 --> 252.48000000000002
show but I will post the

248.56 --> 252.48
link anybody could check it

264.919 --> 271.71999999999997
out and just yeah the imagery alone is

268.52 --> 271.71999999999997
pretty amazing

279.919 --> 285.52
so yeah I'm kind of into that right

294.4 --> 299.88
now good

296.759 --> 302.639
stuff very interesting very mysterious

299.88 --> 304.36
[Music]

302.639 --> 307.32
like there's some real Mysteries that

304.36 --> 310.0
accompany like these places cuz some of

307.32 --> 313.52
them just don't really have any signs of

310.0 --> 316.52
excavation or anything like

313.52 --> 316.52
caves

317.28 --> 325.919
but no debris anywhere from just digging

322.4 --> 328.71999999999997
it out like none at all like that is

325.919 --> 331.44
mysterious like where the hell did all

328.72 --> 335.84000000000003
the stuff go they dug

331.44 --> 336.88
out carved out like there's no trace of

335.84 --> 341.0
piles

336.88 --> 344.56
of rock and sediment as usually happens

341.0 --> 347.6
with Mining and yeah that those are like

344.56 --> 349.8
Mysteries where did it all

347.6 --> 353.36
go was it like

349.8 --> 356.40000000000003
a a mining operation and they literally

353.36 --> 360.56
mined every little bit and transported

356.4 --> 363.0
it entirely and then just for the fun of

360.56 --> 365.44
it made the rest into

363.0 --> 368.44
these

365.44 --> 368.44
designed

369.759 --> 380.039
caves could be I mean that would be a

375.199 --> 380.039
solution but yeah it's it's all very

383.72 --> 390.68
mysterious right I see it's

387.68 --> 392.96
Monday nobody's just here yet that's

390.68 --> 392.96
that's

393.12 --> 398.16
odd but maybe it's because it's Monday

425.879 --> 431.72
all right guess I'll just have to look

428.319 --> 434.319
around and see if I can find anything

431.72 --> 439.08000000000004
interesting I can talk

434.319 --> 439.08000000000004
about till people find their way to my

448.52 --> 452.479
chat for

503.52 --> 512.4789999999999
right got 19 watching already okay so

508.44 --> 512.479
hello for

550.0 --> 553.519
all right so I had a goody pretty good

551.76 --> 556.36
night

553.519 --> 558.24
sleep hey Lucy level first in chat good

556.36 --> 561.399
to see

558.24 --> 563.279
you I had a pretty good night's sleep

561.399 --> 566.88
so

563.279 --> 571.279
did glad I was able to start in

566.88 --> 571.279
time but uh

589.72 --> 597.839
yeah I'm Still Still Into the waking up

593.959 --> 600.3599999999999
process like uh previous shows I've been

597.839 --> 602.9590000000001
like up way

600.36 --> 608.76
earlier so that I have like a couple of

602.959 --> 608.76
hours to properly wake up get in form

609.72 --> 615.36
and get more

612.48 --> 618.04
focused even like drinking coffee before

615.36 --> 621.44
the show which seemed to kind of

618.04 --> 622.5999999999999
help but yeah today did not I got pretty

621.44 --> 628.399
much

622.6 --> 628.399
at 45 minutes to do everything

629.23 --> 635.16
[Music]

630.399 --> 635.16
and I'm still just a little bit

651.24 --> 656.0
hay I really hope some people are going

653.56 --> 656.0
to show

657.88 --> 668.24
up it's Bank holid Monday okay what oh

664.24 --> 668.24
really okay

705.68 --> 712.4399999999999
so what does that mean

707.36 --> 712.44
exactly other than the banks are

713.639 --> 717.2
closed that is that

718.24 --> 723.309
it for

720.25 --> 723.309
[Music]

753.88 --> 756.99
[Music]

759.92 --> 765.4399999999999
are you sure about

762.279 --> 770.32
that may they when I look it up on

765.44 --> 770.32
Wikipedia it says it's the 1st of May

780.839 --> 788.72
I guess it's a slightly different origin

783.68 --> 790.959
as International workers day maybe I

788.72 --> 790.9590000000001
don't

800.76 --> 806.72
know lots of people up work right so

804.399 --> 811.12
everybody's just having an easy

806.72 --> 811.12
day okay makes sense

814.76 --> 818.68
I guess it's going to be a bit of a

816.04 --> 818.68
quiet day

829.639 --> 834.44
then I mean I don't mind yesterday's

832.279 --> 836.32
show was pretty intense I mean was very

834.44 --> 841.0400000000001
focused

836.32 --> 841.0400000000001
uh a whole bunch of explaining to do

841.399 --> 846.399
about the lightning

842.8 --> 849.8
bolt or the

846.399 --> 849.8
uh lightning

852.56 --> 855.92
bolt ball

858.639 --> 864.839
lightning maybe it's the first Monday in

861.199 --> 864.8389999999999
May oh okay

886.68 --> 889.8599999999999
[Music]

892.12 --> 898.639
hm but yeah I still love to

896.399 --> 900.759
discuss subject that I talked about

898.639 --> 905.0790000000001
yesterday

900.759 --> 907.48
today but all transmutation and

905.079 --> 909.519
the convictions

907.48 --> 912.519
of

909.519 --> 912.519
ether

912.88 --> 917.0
and ball lightning being

917.56 --> 924.1199999999999
alive and the weird space time

921.639 --> 926.36
terminologies that were used within the

924.12 --> 928.44
explanations of the diagram I'd love to

926.36 --> 929.6
discuss that I didn't really get much

928.44 --> 932.639
feedback

929.6 --> 936.759
yesterday about it even though I did

932.639 --> 939.24
ask but uh yeah I mean some of you may

936.759 --> 942.1990000000001
have actually watch that

939.24 --> 943.9590000000001
video it is 2our long video and I mean

942.199 --> 947.3599999999999
it is it is tough yeah I got to be

943.959 --> 949.5999999999999
focused to be able to to really

947.36 --> 949.6
understand

951.36 --> 959.399
it which I happened to be when I watched

954.56 --> 959.399
it Saturday really focused

960.68 --> 965.519
but uh yeah I'd love to discuss

967.959 --> 975.7589999999999
it also told David like hey I I'd love

971.279 --> 975.759
to discuss it I think I get it

1047.84 --> 1051.8799999999999
okay for

1072.44 --> 1075.64
[Music]

1081.6 --> 1085.4399999999998
yeah apparently in the Netherlands and

1083.08 --> 1088.08
some places like because of like the

1085.44 --> 1090.24
excessive amount of rain which to be

1088.08 --> 1091.96
fair is actually kind of normal

1090.24 --> 1094.08
especially during

1091.96 --> 1095.24
April but I mean there's been a lot of

1094.08 --> 1100.3999999999999
flooding

1095.24 --> 1104.48
and there's not been proper Water

1100.4 --> 1106.44
Management in order to make sure that

1104.48 --> 1109.4
this gets

1106.44 --> 1112.679
fixed which is funly enough like there

1109.4 --> 1112.679
is a a

1114.2 --> 1122.44
government a government entity that

1117.4 --> 1126.679
deals call it the water State and seems

1122.44 --> 1132.4
like they are purposely neglecting their

1126.679 --> 1134.799
duties and just letting us drown in the

1132.4 --> 1139.52
problems which has been happening for a

1134.799 --> 1139.52
while it is very very bad

1140.52 --> 1143.08
that's going

1146.559 --> 1151.48
on I mean they should be doing their

1150.4 --> 1154.5590000000002
damn

1151.48 --> 1157.28
jobs but instead it seems like they're

1154.559 --> 1159.9189999999999
like climate Fanatics and so they're

1157.28 --> 1163.96
neglecting their job of water

1159.919 --> 1166.8400000000001
management in favor of rolling out the

1163.96 --> 1169.0
message of oh the climate is changing

1166.84 --> 1171.1999999999998
yeah but you're you're there you're

1169.0 --> 1176.039
literally there and getting

1171.2 --> 1179.88
funding to deal with the water and

1176.039 --> 1179.8799999999999
ensure that places don't get

1180.28 --> 1188.24
flooded and they don't seem to be doing

1182.88 --> 1188.24
that and that is arguably a

1192.159 --> 1198.2
crime so yeah that's a thing that's

1194.36 --> 1198.1999999999998
going on here in the Netherlands

1202.6 --> 1206.48
right and it's not even about oh they

1204.4 --> 1210.52
need to do something about the rain no

1206.48 --> 1210.52
no no no they do need to do something

1210.64 --> 1215.159
about the water management so that

1213.4 --> 1217.24
people will have the ability to

1215.159 --> 1220.0
basically pump out the

1217.24 --> 1222.799
rain but you got to pump it somewhere if

1220.0 --> 1222.799
there's nowhere to

1223.48 --> 1229.6
pump yeah then there's no

1226.559 --> 1232.559
point and

1229.6 --> 1235.039
it all used to work

1232.559 --> 1237.799
smoothly and it seems like there's just

1235.039 --> 1239.0
been a lot of neglect and even crazy

1237.799 --> 1243.76
things

1239.0 --> 1247.08
like disassembling dkes and all that

1243.76 --> 1250.64
like for absolutely no logical

1247.08 --> 1252.28
reason so there's neglect and arguably

1250.64 --> 1254.2800000000002
sabotage

1252.28 --> 1256.96
happening and there needs to be a

1254.28 --> 1260.6
reckoning for

1256.96 --> 1260.6000000000001
that like

1262.96 --> 1265.72
they're through the government they're

1264.84 --> 1268.52
getting

1265.72 --> 1272.1200000000001
paid I'd say it's pretty much treason at

1268.52 --> 1275.0
this point like they are acting

1272.12 --> 1278.4799999999998
treasonous neglecting the duty that they

1275.0 --> 1278.48
specifically get funding

1278.6 --> 1288.6
for in favor of their own political

1283.0 --> 1288.6
strives which are treacherous in nature

1289.4 --> 1293.76
so I wonder how long it's going to take

1291.44 --> 1296.76
before the people that are responsible

1293.76 --> 1300.039
for the management of that are going

1296.76 --> 1304.72
to basically go to jail for it because

1300.039 --> 1304.72
they should they should go to jail for

1306.0 --> 1310.08
treachery J treachery against the judge

1308.76 --> 1315.2
people

1310.08 --> 1320.4399999999998
and taking payment while neglecting the

1315.2 --> 1320.44
duties that come with that payment

1322.559 --> 1326.08
all right so that's that's a

1335.48 --> 1341.279
thing overall people are catching on

1338.36 --> 1343.9599999999998
it's about goddamn time that the whole

1341.279 --> 1346.159
stupid Ukraine war is really not about

1343.96 --> 1349.32
winning anything it's literally about

1346.159 --> 1352.24
depopulating Europe people are finally

1349.32 --> 1356.0
catching on it's like yeah throwing

1352.24 --> 1359.0
money at it and just getting a lot of

1356.0 --> 1361.279
Eastern Europeans and they even want

1359.0 --> 1365.84
Western Europeans to basically go there

1361.279 --> 1369.08
and do the same thing just get killed in

1365.84 --> 1373.12
a in a meat grinder

1369.08 --> 1375.36
metaphorically cuz Ukraine is like every

1373.12 --> 1378.12
they do is completely

1375.36 --> 1380.52
disastrous death toll is like record

1378.12 --> 1383.2399999999998
high and it stays record high every

1380.52 --> 1383.24
single damn

1388.2 --> 1392.64
time okay gorgeous boy good see

1393.4 --> 1398.64
you yeah I don't know I thought that

1396.919 --> 1401.72
Mayday is the first of May too that's

1398.64 --> 1404.159
what Wikipedia says so I don't know what

1401.72 --> 1408.4
Lucy levels talking

1404.159 --> 1408.4
about no idea

1411.23 --> 1414.4
[Music]

1415.88 --> 1419.7990000000002
all right so that's awareness about

1417.96 --> 1423.6000000000001
Ukraine

1419.799 --> 1426.84
it's it's a a depopulation project it's

1423.6 --> 1426.84
not a war that can be

1428.679 --> 1436.6000000000001
one and it should be shut down

1432.919 --> 1439.76
and I mean it's obviously a money

1436.6 --> 1442.4399999999998
laundering project as well

1439.76 --> 1446.1589999999999
there's huge amounts of money just

1442.44 --> 1449.3600000000001
missing it's all just I mean it's not

1446.159 --> 1453.64
even typical it's just standard at this

1449.36 --> 1453.6399999999999
point just standard procedure for

1454.44 --> 1461.4
them to do colossal money laundering and

1459.2 --> 1462.32
get as much people killed in the process

1461.4 --> 1466.6000000000001
as they

1462.32 --> 1469.9189999999999
can just what they want they

1466.6 --> 1471.9189999999999
want depopulation

1469.919 --> 1474.24
specifically of us so that they can

1471.919 --> 1478.64
replace us with completely useless

1474.24 --> 1481.0
people from abroad that have no care to

1478.64 --> 1484.0
to maintain the civilization or

1481.0 --> 1486.88
structures that we have they want to

1484.0 --> 1486.88
destroy all of

1490.52 --> 1496.32
us and we're all barely holding it

1497.08 --> 1502.76
together cuz we're under siege from top

1499.96 --> 1506.96
down money Government powers are

1502.76 --> 1508.52
besieging us imposing their antium will

1506.96 --> 1512.76
on

1508.52 --> 1514.399
us and yeah we can resist of course we

1512.76 --> 1519.2
can

1514.399 --> 1519.1999999999998
but I mean they're not going to

1520.84 --> 1525.799
adapt so I wonder how long it's going to

1523.279 --> 1528.48
take I mean oh yeah oh this is all wrong

1525.799 --> 1530.96
cool let's just keep telling everybody

1528.48 --> 1535.24
how wrong it all is for the next [Â __Â ]

1530.96 --> 1537.44
decade I'm sure they'll just stop if we

1535.24 --> 1541.2
just make everybody

1537.44 --> 1544.3600000000001
aware no no no half the people are so

1541.2 --> 1547.039
incapable of dealing with that situation

1544.36 --> 1550.1999999999998
and accepting that that's real they'd

1547.039 --> 1553.24
rather hop on that bandwagon and

1550.2 --> 1557.0
literally get themselves killed just to

1553.24 --> 1561.039
avoid becoming aware that it's

1557.0 --> 1561.039
real and they will do

1562.84 --> 1569.1589999999999
that so just standing by and letting it

1566.6 --> 1571.6399999999999
all happen and not cooperating well it's

1569.159 --> 1572.919
still going to happen then and they're

1571.64 --> 1575.24
still going to

1572.919 --> 1576.88
succeed and you're still going to lose

1575.24 --> 1578.72
everything and you're still not going to

1576.88 --> 1580.3200000000002
be able to recognize the nation that

1578.72 --> 1586.96
you've lived

1580.32 --> 1589.6789999999999
in and yeah you fail you braced yourself

1586.96 --> 1592.52
against it and achieve

1589.679 --> 1595.64
nothing now going with it is like

1592.52 --> 1598.12
imminent death that you deserve with a

1595.64 --> 1600.48
lot of Shame you deserve to go to hell

1598.12 --> 1603.36
if you go along with it literally rot in

1600.48 --> 1605.76
hell if you do but just bracing against

1603.36 --> 1609.12
it and it's not going to help anything

1605.76 --> 1609.12
you're still going to lose

1611.48 --> 1614.48
then

1614.96 --> 1620.0
yeah this

1617.0 --> 1624.48
government Bank aning corporate

1620.0 --> 1627.84
conspiracy against the people and the

1624.48 --> 1632.52
Nations under the guys of climate change

1627.84 --> 1634.76
or whatever the [Â __Â ] crazy ideologies

1632.52 --> 1639.96
and ideas they use to justify what

1634.76 --> 1639.96
they're doing they need to be

1645.559 --> 1650.08
arrested including anybody that's on

1648.36 --> 1653.6399999999999
board with it

1650.08 --> 1656.1589999999999
anybody and like treat it very

1653.64 --> 1658.8400000000001
harshly and when I say anybody that

1656.159 --> 1660.7990000000002
includes PE

1658.84 --> 1663.72
judges all of

1660.799 --> 1666.559
it I'd say the judges that are on board

1663.72 --> 1668.72
with that depopulation system and all

1666.559 --> 1670.799
that that are cooperating with this they

1668.72 --> 1673.24
should probably get the death penalty

1670.799 --> 1676.08
specifically because they are kind of

1673.24 --> 1678.32
the cornerstones that are like enabling

1676.08 --> 1682.96
this and preventing

1678.32 --> 1682.96
them from being deposed

1688.12 --> 1694.9189999999999
of so yeah I don't know however you're

1690.919 --> 1696.76
going to do it I mean how long how long

1694.919 --> 1699.96
you going to let this keep going I mean

1696.76 --> 1702.919
at some point there will be no other way

1699.96 --> 1705.919
to even depose of all them then through

1702.919 --> 1705.919
terrorism

1708.559 --> 1714.32
so what's it going to

1710.48 --> 1714.32
be what are you all going to

1719.559 --> 1728.399
do but maybe if you just like vent it

1724.279 --> 1730.919
all off and just wi free palestin free

1728.399 --> 1733.32
Palestine all day and and glue yourself

1730.919 --> 1734.76
to the road for climate change maybe

1733.32 --> 1739.36
that will [Â __Â ]

1734.76 --> 1743.2
help no it won't because that's exactly

1739.36 --> 1745.84
the same group that's that's what we're

1743.2 --> 1749.559
hand that's what they hand down to their

1745.84 --> 1752.36
minions like oh you go do

1749.559 --> 1755.8799999999999
this even though it all makes everything

1752.36 --> 1757.8799999999999
worse it makes everything worse yeah and

1755.88 --> 1761.0390000000002
not saying that free Palestine is

1757.88 --> 1763.1200000000001
completely illegitimate as a cause I

1761.039 --> 1765.08
understand the Grievances it's insane

1763.12 --> 1768.1999999999998
but hey it's been insane for a [Â __Â ]

1765.08 --> 1770.279
Century yeah yeah oh and now you're

1768.2 --> 1772.159
going to do this now that all the

1770.279 --> 1775.559
governments and corporations are all

1772.159 --> 1778.519
unified to depopulate and Destroy

1775.559 --> 1781.48
Europe in the Western World now you're

1778.519 --> 1784.48
going to be part of that group are

1781.48 --> 1784.48
you

1788.24 --> 1794.559
oh you're all cowards and you deserve to

1791.559 --> 1794.559
die

1801.36 --> 1807.6
yeah we need to take care of business we

1803.76 --> 1810.279
need to depose of the government the

1807.6 --> 1813.279
corrupted Judicial System the mega

1810.279 --> 1816.24
corporations and the banks that are all

1813.279 --> 1820.679
conspiring provably and out in the

1816.24 --> 1820.679
open to depopulate

1821.039 --> 1828.279
us

1822.88 --> 1828.279
and we need to hurry it the [Â __Â ] up

1833.66 --> 1837.6000000000001
[Music]

1834.88 --> 1841.1200000000001
cuz just bracing against

1837.6 --> 1844.24
it it's not enough yeah we're not making

1841.12 --> 1847.279
any progress by doing that yeah even

1844.24 --> 1849.44
winning hearts and Minds is just it's no

1847.279 --> 1852.32
point like what are you going to do with

1849.44 --> 1854.24
those one hearts and Minds at the end of

1852.32 --> 1858.24
the road have you ever considered that

1854.24 --> 1860.48
how is that going to help depose of them

1858.24 --> 1863.279
how is that going to help get them

1860.48 --> 1865.799
arrested I mean the crimes are already

1863.279 --> 1869.559
out in the open on the record on a list

1865.799 --> 1872.6
list is being kept but when is anything

1869.559 --> 1875.32
going to be done with that

1872.6 --> 1876.8799999999999
list when are the crimes finally going

1875.32 --> 1879.08
to

1876.88 --> 1882.8400000000001
be accounted

1879.08 --> 1886.559
for and followed up

1882.84 --> 1889.1589999999999
on cuz it seems like it just leads to

1886.559 --> 1890.9189999999999
more bickering and them making

1889.159 --> 1895.159
nonsensical

1890.919 --> 1896.88
excuses to just ignore it ignore the

1895.159 --> 1899.0390000000002
crimes that they are committing out in

1896.88 --> 1899.0390000000002
the

1905.279 --> 1908.279
open

1909.679 --> 1918.279
yeah so yeah I'm I'm just wondering like

1913.76 --> 1921.279
when are these people going to be

1918.279 --> 1921.279
arrested

1921.639 --> 1925.9189999999999
kept like maybe in a secret location or

1924.84 --> 1928.08
anything I mean what you're going to

1925.919 --> 1929.519
trust a public jail there a [Â __Â ]

1928.08 --> 1931.84
judge that they just going to

1929.519 --> 1935.279
immediately have them released

1931.84 --> 1939.84
again so maybe they just have to

1935.279 --> 1939.84
die just picking them

1940.24 --> 1946.6
off assassinating them by just random

1943.72 --> 1950.279
bums that just like oh yeah they're just

1946.6 --> 1952.7199999999998
nuts and under drugs and oh look oh look

1950.279 --> 1956.12
a politician one of the really [Â __Â ] up

1952.72 --> 1958.84
politician that inspires me to

1956.12 --> 1961.12
just get my butter knife out and

1958.84 --> 1964.6
basically rip their guts

1961.12 --> 1964.6
out just like

1966.36 --> 1971.399
that right maybe that needs to

1969.639 --> 1975.559
happen I

1971.399 --> 1978.5189999999998
mean I think that like a lot of people

1975.559 --> 1982.1589999999999
will like chair

1978.519 --> 1984.639
loudly on social media everywhere if a

1982.159 --> 1988.159
couple of these Dem missionary cabinet

1984.639 --> 1990.9189999999999
politicians would just suddenly get

1988.159 --> 1992.6390000000001
killed I think everybody would be very

1990.919 --> 1995.919
happy about that

1992.639 --> 1997.84
because well the idea of them just

1995.919 --> 1999.88
getting arrested for the crimes that

1997.84 --> 2005.039
they've openly

1999.88 --> 2005.0390000000002
committed seems to be not leading

2005.36 --> 2008.799
anywhere they're still in power they're

2007.88 --> 2013.6000000000001
still

2008.799 --> 2016.559
just doing out the money of the state

2013.6 --> 2020.519
without getting permission from

2016.559 --> 2020.519
anybody and getting away with

2020.679 --> 2024.1200000000001
it like

2025.32 --> 2030.96
dictators

2028.2 --> 2035.519
so when is somebody actually just going

2030.96 --> 2035.519
to do the next step

2041.2 --> 2047.0800000000002
or are you all just part of

2044.08 --> 2049.3199999999997
this is everybody content to just let

2047.08 --> 2051.919
everybody die in

2049.32 --> 2056.28
humiliation and to transform the place

2051.919 --> 2059.0789999999997
into a lesser constructive State into a

2056.28 --> 2061.0400000000004
state that really nobody can be proud of

2059.079 --> 2066.28
and that's going to be demoralizing to

2061.04 --> 2069.399
everybody making our our people lose our

2066.28 --> 2072.159
cohesive cultural spirit that made us

2069.399 --> 2074.7599999999998
great are you just going to all let that

2072.159 --> 2077.2000000000003
happen did you already lose it are you

2074.76 --> 2081.119
already a [Â __Â ] zombie out

2077.2 --> 2083.7599999999998
there content to just let everything die

2081.119 --> 2086.2000000000003
must be a real Thrill Ride going through

2083.76 --> 2088.32
life like that right it's like

2086.2 --> 2089.839
everything is doomed you're not going to

2088.32 --> 2091.96
do anything about it nobody's going to

2089.839 --> 2096.0789999999997
do anything about it probably going to

2091.96 --> 2100.4
complain bother some people and not do

2096.079 --> 2100.4

3060.079 --> 3065.079
sorry I'm sorry I'm just reflecting back

3062.799 --> 3068.48
to just a bunch of nonsense that I had

3065.079 --> 3071.04
over the last few days about people

3068.48 --> 3074.0
never ending complaining about my slow

3071.04 --> 3076.24
mode and oh my God it's so

3074.0 --> 3079.88
terrible I thought that maybe that was

3076.24 --> 3083.64
the reason but uh it's off right so you

3079.88 --> 3087.359
could just blabber on as much as you

3083.64 --> 3091.5589999999997
like I'm not talking to you

3087.359 --> 3093.839
specifically gas H I'm generally

3091.559 --> 3096.92
frustrated

3093.839 --> 3101.24
because I don't know at the start of my

3096.92 --> 3102.92
show there's just no no

3101.24 --> 3107.2799999999997
talking

3102.92 --> 3108.2400000000002
none like I'm 50 minutes in and there's

3107.28 --> 3111.079
been

3108.24 --> 3113.9199999999996
like eight

3111.079 --> 3118.52
sentences and sentences that barely

3113.92 --> 3118.52
contain anything noteworthy at all

3120.76 --> 3125.7990000000004
yeah like everybody's just asleep now

3123.319 --> 3129.4
like everybody's just sleeping and lazy

3125.799 --> 3132.92
and no demotivated for some damn reason

3129.4 --> 3132.92
I don't know why the hell you would

3133.16 --> 3139.839
be right when I bring up a bit of a

3137.44 --> 3142.92
rough subject it still is not waking

3139.839 --> 3146.52
people up not even borders

3142.92 --> 3148.839
boy who managed to crank out one freak

3146.52 --> 3150.68
freaking sentence to correct somebody

3148.839 --> 3154.2
else and that's

3150.68 --> 3157.5589999999997
it border boy got right back to bed or

3154.2 --> 3159.68
something I guess maybe everybody just

3157.559 --> 3162.96
decided like oh well maybe this Monday

3159.68 --> 3165.9199999999996
we're just going to sleep until 8 in the

3162.96 --> 3168.319
evening cuz we're all too depressed to

3165.92 --> 3168.319
do

3169.96 --> 3175.599
anything I don't know how else to

3172.119 --> 3175.599
explain this

3188.68 --> 3192.68
SO gas H don't take it too

3193.52 --> 3198.04
personal I'm glad you're here to to talk

3196.599 --> 3202.28
you know it would be good if you could

3198.04 --> 3204.44
just like talk and and

3202.28 --> 3207.0
not

3204.44 --> 3209.2400000000002
exclusively complain

3207.0 --> 3211.68
when you talk right because these four

3209.24 --> 3215.04
sentences

3211.68 --> 3219.319
here every single sentence you just

3215.04 --> 3222.16
wrote contains a complaint yeah is it

3219.319 --> 3225.7599999999998
might might be part of the reason why

3222.16 --> 3228.5589999999997
I'm getting a little agitated

3225.76 --> 3231.8390000000004
yeah it it might have something to do

3228.559 --> 3235.8390000000004
with that have you ever thought about

3231.839 --> 3235.839
that huh

3239.319 --> 3245.2799999999997
right if all you do is just complain and

3242.76 --> 3248.559
complain and

3245.28 --> 3250.3190000000004
complain yeah that's it's not really

3248.559 --> 3252.96
helping

3250.319 --> 3255.44
anybody that's not going to improve the

3252.96 --> 3257.2400000000002
quality of the show it's not going to

3255.44 --> 3260.599
improve my

3257.24 --> 3262.68
mood it's not going to bring a subject

3260.599 --> 3264.1600000000003
to the table that might be inspiring

3262.68 --> 3269.359
that I could go

3264.16 --> 3269.359
with nothing for

3288.55 --> 3291.6690000000003
[Music]

3316.119 --> 3319.0
guess I'll just keep

3325.319 --> 3328.319
digging

3355.24 --> 3359.2799999999997
for for

3401.76 --> 3407.44
all right well I I guess I'm going to

3404.799 --> 3410.119
round out the show

3407.44 --> 3412.4
then and don't think I'm going to show

3410.119 --> 3412.4
up

3412.68 --> 3419.48
tomorrow because this is absolutely

3416.48 --> 3419.48
ridiculous

3453.03 --> 3456.059
[Applause]

3505.119 --> 3509.079
that's for

3552.559 --> 3556.92
wow I got four uploades unbelievable I

3555.2 --> 3559.52
don't know who the [Â __Â ] is even doing

3556.92 --> 3559.52
that at this

3559.839 --> 3564.52
point who was doing that

3580.4 --> 3584.119
Hello Steven Jarvis

3654.24 --> 3659.0789999999997
with my rosemary plant it seems like

3657.319 --> 3660.52
Rosemary is just not going to stop

3659.079 --> 3664.119
blooming

3660.52 --> 3666.52
ever like it it just keeps it's been

3664.119 --> 3668.96
blooming even throughout the

3666.52 --> 3670.7599999999998
winter does seem like this branch is

3668.96 --> 3677.0
dying

3670.76 --> 3677.0
though so it's not doing super

3677.44 --> 3682.88
optimal but yeah Central Branch just

3681.16 --> 3686.0389999999998
seems to

3682.88 --> 3689.2400000000002
be immutable

3686.039 --> 3689.2400000000002
keeps blooming all the

3703.039 --> 3707.88
time

3704.88 --> 3711.119
wow screen is actually freezing on that

3707.88 --> 3711.119
that's hilarious

3724.48 --> 3729.359
so Steven Jarvis what are you up to

3730.25 --> 3733.4
[Music]

3763.96 --> 3770.48
holiday today

3767.319 --> 3770.48
gardening all

3774.039 --> 3778.6800000000003
right it seems like it's it's a day

3776.359 --> 3780.96
where just nobody says anything

3778.68 --> 3783.279
everybody's just on mute today for some

3780.96 --> 3783.279
damn

3783.72 --> 3790.52
reason so and that gets me a little

3786.88 --> 3792.1600000000003
frustrated so excuse

3790.52 --> 3794.599
[Music]

3792.16 --> 3798.2
me excuse me if I get a little

3794.599 --> 3801.88
frustrated that nobody godamn says any

3798.2 --> 3801.8799999999997
damn thing here

3810.48 --> 3814.319
busman's holiday what does that

3831.0 --> 3837.72
mean oh by the way I did watch like an

3834.039 --> 3841.2400000000002
interesting video yesterday sort of

3837.72 --> 3846.24
interesting the Channel's kind of

3841.24 --> 3848.839
dubious and science [Â __Â ] and they

3846.24 --> 3851.24
are but it's

3848.839 --> 3852.359
basically about something practical

3851.24 --> 3855.64
where they

3852.359 --> 3857.68
say it was about nuclear power plants

3855.64 --> 3860.319
and nuclear waste and that apparently

3857.68 --> 3862.319
even in the 60s there was a specific

3860.319 --> 3865.839
nuclear power plant I think it's still

3862.319 --> 3870.68
there that runs exclusively on nuclear

3865.839 --> 3874.319
waste instead of fresh fuel rods and all

3870.68 --> 3878.319
that and that basically nuclear waste

3874.319 --> 3881.079
isn't nuclear waste it can literally be

3878.319 --> 3885.16
used as

3881.079 --> 3888.2000000000003
just nuclear fuel for power generation

3885.16 --> 3889.7599999999998
like a nuclear power plant exactly the

3888.2 --> 3893.0
same

3889.76 --> 3896.0
and that's that was really interesting I

3893.0 --> 3896.0
thought

3902.16 --> 3907.0
check your ban list for I don't know

3904.279 --> 3910.359
what you're talking about gas

3907.0 --> 3913.44
H uh I don't think anybody's messing

3910.359 --> 3913.44
with my channel like

3914.079 --> 3919.48
that I don't know who would have been

3916.48 --> 3919.48
banned

3947.48 --> 3952.359
so yeah I don't know what you're talking

3949.359 --> 3952.359
about

3955.76 --> 3959.7200000000003
I don't see anybody that's

3961.88 --> 3967.6800000000003
like that's not supposed to be in the

3964.319 --> 3967.68
band list

3994.0 --> 3998.64
so yeah don't know what you're talking

4004.599 --> 4011.6800000000003
about started a garden inside the house

4008.68 --> 4011.68
oh

4014.52 --> 4021.079
okay too quiet no gas H it's not because

4018.48 --> 4023.92
people are banned it's

4021.079 --> 4026.6800000000003
because it's one of those weird days one

4023.92 --> 4031.16
of those days where I like really get

4026.68 --> 4031.16
[Â __Â ] agitated CU everybody's

4031.88 --> 4039.119
just we're all going to slow down to

4035.68 --> 4043.0389999999998
onethird of the normal

4039.119 --> 4046.96
interactions barely respond to

4043.039 --> 4050.3190000000004
anything but we object when people try

4046.96 --> 4052.76
to hurry us yeah that seems to be

4050.319 --> 4056.92
happening right

4052.76 --> 4056.92
now find it quite

4060.119 --> 4066.039
agitating so but anyway you're going now

4063.16 --> 4069.279
and got three people in chat with some

4066.039 --> 4073.44
inter internal interaction so it's

4069.279 --> 4076.64
fine took you a goddamn hour though to

4073.44 --> 4079.64
get there yeah

4076.64 --> 4079.64
that part is

4081.279 --> 4087.119
insufferable but you're here now so it's

4084.64 --> 4090.0389999999998
all

4087.119 --> 4093.039
good right only reason why it would be

4090.039 --> 4096.16
too quiet right now is because you're

4093.039 --> 4096.16
not saying

4103.0 --> 4108.839
anything what I find much weirder is

4105.279 --> 4111.080000000001
that I got four rogans up when there was

4108.839 --> 4114.679
literally nobody saying anything like

4111.08 --> 4114.679
that's weird to me like who did

4118.4 --> 4125.3589999999995
that no we don't have a Mayday in the

4121.0 --> 4125.359
Netherlands it is UK

4136.6 --> 4139.6
I

4173.44 --> 4178.4
link to Russia

4175.4 --> 4178.4
X

4179.12 --> 4182.12
okay

4182.44 --> 4190.08
uh I don't know about that I

4186.6 --> 4193.159000000001
mean Mayday is linked to a lot of

4190.08 --> 4197.8
different things and I mean a lot it's

4193.159 --> 4199.599999999999
like almost every conce historical event

4197.8 --> 4201.96
is

4199.6 --> 4206.92
always damn

4201.96 --> 4209.96
it a [Â __Â ] it's all linked up the MayDay

4206.92 --> 4213.159
it's all all of it I don't know why

4209.96 --> 4215.96
man like it Mayday is linked up to

4213.159 --> 4218.199
Hitler somehow as well and it's like

4215.96 --> 4222.08
everything every [Â __Â ] thing in the

4218.199 --> 4222.08
[Â __Â ] world is linked up to MayDay

4223.239 --> 4229.799999999999
somehow like pagan massive sacrificial

4227.32 --> 4234.4
rituals guess what it's licked up to

4229.8 --> 4236.84
MayDay oh Hitler things or some insane

4234.4 --> 4239.879999999999
thing yeah it's linked up to MayDay oh

4236.84 --> 4242.92
Soviet Union linked up to MayDay you say

4239.88 --> 4245.56
who could have foreseen that and I'll

4242.92 --> 4248.6
bet that like tartaria is probably

4245.56 --> 4251.92
linked up to MayDay and communist

4248.6 --> 4255.8
China's probably linked up to MayDay and

4251.92 --> 4257.88
maybe maybe even Egypt is link led up to

4255.8 --> 4260.96
MayDay because every [Â __Â ] thing in

4257.88 --> 4265.04
the world is somehow linked up to MayDay

4260.96 --> 4267.719
yeah it's not the first time I've heard

4265.04 --> 4270.08
that yeah every [Â __Â ] thing in the

4267.719 --> 4272.4800000000005
[Â __Â ] world is linked up to MayDay and

4270.08 --> 4275.0
maybe that's why everybody on mday just

4272.48 --> 4278.799999999999
becomes like a [Â __Â ]

4275.0 --> 4282.0
zombie can barely socially function or

4278.8 --> 4284.4800000000005
something I don't know what the hell

4282.0 --> 4289.08
man I don't seem to have that issue

4284.48 --> 4291.599999999999
though I'm fun just fine just kind of

4289.08 --> 4295.5199999999995
agitated that everybody's suddenly just

4291.6 --> 4295.52
like acting like zombies

4320.44 --> 4326.28
yeah I know gas H

4322.719 --> 4327.8
yeah maybe it's like Mayday is like the

4326.28 --> 4329.48
first

4327.8 --> 4333.6
holiday

4329.48 --> 4337.28
ever it was the first special thing that

4333.6 --> 4339.4400000000005
was like imposed on Humanity when they

4337.28 --> 4341.199
first came walking out of paradise like

4339.44 --> 4345.5199999999995
hey oh you know those day and night

4341.199 --> 4346.839999999999
cycles guess what Mayday the first con

4345.52 --> 4350.639
they ever

4346.84 --> 4354.32
heard of a special day probably yeah it

4350.639 --> 4355.4800000000005
it's probably like the oldest thing of

4354.32 --> 4359.36
all

4355.48 --> 4362.12
time my point is is that every [Â __Â ]

4359.36 --> 4365.0
thing in the world seems to always have

4362.12 --> 4367.28
their own damn thing that they do on

4365.0 --> 4369.12
Mayday It's associated with them they

4367.28 --> 4370.96
always like oh it's the day of this oh

4369.12 --> 4374.36
it's the day of that oh it's Labor Day

4370.96 --> 4377.32
oh it's the day of the king or queen or

4374.36 --> 4380.719
whatever the [Â __Â ] they can think of

4377.32 --> 4382.759999999999
everybody makes it their own thing that

4380.719 --> 4385.12
has nothing to do with the

4382.76 --> 4388.12
original everybody does

4385.12 --> 4388.12
it

4390.239 --> 4395.28
everybody all

4392.28 --> 4401.719
empires in all ages do something with

4395.28 --> 4401.719
this Mayday and make it their own thing

4404.12 --> 4407.12
everybody

4411.97 --> 4415.1
[Music]

4434.04 --> 4437.04
for

4464.04 --> 4467.04
for

4494.0 --> 4497.0
for

4523.96 --> 4526.96
for

4553.92 --> 4556.92

4583.92 --> 4587.88

4607.7 --> 4610.83
[Music]

4636.44 --> 4641.678999999999
H holy [Â __Â ] may they has a huge

4640.08 --> 4646.28
Wikipedia

4641.679 --> 4646.28
page that's just nuts

4649.0 --> 4653.48
just check it out bro

4655.37 --> 4658.47
[Music]

4691.56 --> 4696.400000000001
I let bring up the May pole though

4714.48 --> 4717.959999999999
M Poes May

4722.199 --> 4731.239
Queens what the day of swearing occurred

4726.48 --> 4731.239
the following month June what

4736.28 --> 4739.239
what the hell does that

4763.12 --> 4766.92
mean this is kind of of

4773.639 --> 4780.4800000000005
confusing but I mean yeah it seems

4775.92 --> 4784.32
Mayday is like rooted in in one of the

4780.48 --> 4787.44
original Pagan

4784.32 --> 4791.5599999999995
celebrations it's probably yeah as I

4787.44 --> 4795.5599999999995
said like one of the oldest

4791.56 --> 4795.56
Traditions ever

4798.28 --> 4803.44
a tradition that might have still been

4801.04 --> 4806.32
in practice even when

4803.44 --> 4808.759999999999
humans like in pre- Babylonian times

4806.32 --> 4809.679
when humans were still telepathic to

4808.76 --> 4813.0
that

4809.679 --> 4815.28
level I wouldn't be

4813.0 --> 4819.28
surprised hey Brian

4815.28 --> 4819.28
Joe's hello

4853.639 --> 4856.639
on

4883.56 --> 4886.56
for

4913.52 --> 4916.52
for

4943.52 --> 4946.52
for

4973.44 --> 4976.44
e

5003.44 --> 5006.44
e

5033.44 --> 5037.36
e e

5082.04 --> 5086.8
oh we're just talking about that Ryan

5083.96 --> 5089.2390000000005
Jones are we we're just talking about

5086.8 --> 5091.76
the UK public holiday no no that's not

5089.239 --> 5094.5599999999995
what we were just talking

5091.76 --> 5096.84
about it's what you were just talking

5094.56 --> 5096.84
about

5112.8 --> 5121.400000000001
apparently or both of you sure

5117.08 --> 5124.92
whatever like I don't know I

5121.4 --> 5126.199
just it's remarkably boring so object to

5124.92 --> 5131.76
talk

5126.199 --> 5131.759999999999
about just the banking thing like who

5147.76 --> 5155.4400000000005
cares right I mean I'd rather talk about

5150.719 --> 5159.679
ancient mic architecture Maybe

5155.44 --> 5162.48
lightning ball lightning plasmoid

5159.679 --> 5164.119
transmutation but I guess that's not

5162.48 --> 5166.199
interesting now we have to talk about

5164.119 --> 5170.199
the banking

5166.199 --> 5173.199
holiday that's worthy of

5170.199 --> 5176.04
discussion

5173.199 --> 5178.48
what I don't get you guys I don't get

5176.04 --> 5178.48
you at

5183.239 --> 5186.239
all

5213.239 --> 5217.159
for for

5251.159 --> 5256.08
am I having a go with you again

5267.0 --> 5272.119
no you guys start talking well you guys

5269.88 --> 5275.639
seem to like have a conversation with

5272.119 --> 5281.239
each other I was hoping on having a

5275.639 --> 5284.119
maybe a conversation with me gas

5281.239 --> 5287.0
H you just or maybe you just don't want

5284.119 --> 5288.92
to talk to me you want to show up in the

5287.0 --> 5294.159
chat just not talk to me and just talk

5288.92 --> 5294.159
to somebody else like I what is that

5354.32 --> 5360.199
stop it gas it's just getting really

5363.04 --> 5367.08
tedious for

5400.8 --> 5407.88
got to go to Ben practice

5403.719 --> 5407.88
okay right I'll see you later

5411.52 --> 5415.280000000001
then I think I'm going to round out the

5413.76 --> 5419.92
show this has

5415.28 --> 5423.639
been an absolute disaster of a

5419.92 --> 5425.6
show and I really tried it's just it's

5423.639 --> 5428.719
almost

5425.6 --> 5431.280000000001
like it's just like I'm not compatible

5428.719 --> 5433.88
today or something like I feel energy I

5431.28 --> 5437.44
feel like motivation and just like

5433.88 --> 5437.4400000000005
nothing nothing

5441.96 --> 5446.36
happens you don't know much about

5444.159 --> 5448.92
monolithic architecture not a lot of

5446.36 --> 5451.639
people do Stephen

5448.92 --> 5454.4800000000005
Jarvis like they don't know even how

5451.639 --> 5458.2390000000005
that's made they don't know how to

5454.48 --> 5462.638999999999
replicate that or

5458.239 --> 5462.638999999999
anything I mean I got ideas about

5464.44 --> 5468.96
it that came out like with my

5466.639 --> 5472.719
conversation with David

5468.96 --> 5472.719
Weiss on the night owl

5473.159 --> 5478.4
show it's all kinds of things that they

5475.6 --> 5480.280000000001
could do they could use frequency to

5478.4 --> 5482.879999999999
soften it

5480.28 --> 5485.84
up and then you wouldn't have to like

5482.88 --> 5492.08
cut it out as much and they they might

5485.84 --> 5498.4800000000005
have used frequency sound to make it

5492.08 --> 5500.32
lighter so that it would like 100

5498.48 --> 5503.32
tons

5500.32 --> 5506.4
Stone 100 ton Stone would suddenly like

5503.32 --> 5511.199
not weigh 100 ton at

5506.4 --> 5514.44
all so that is suddenly table and

5511.199 --> 5517.239
transportable right influences

5514.44 --> 5521.879999999999
techniques that would may have made it

5517.239 --> 5521.879999999999
like a lot more easy to just do all

5529.04 --> 5535.28
that right the shap stone to make it

5531.88 --> 5538.08
soft and Harden it back up to make it

5535.28 --> 5541.759999999999
light make it

5538.08 --> 5544.719
transportable so that you can then

5541.76 --> 5547.280000000001
suddenly do all these Gigan

5544.719 --> 5549.4
projects without exhausting your

5547.28 --> 5552.4
resources just to be able

5549.4 --> 5552.4
to

5552.639 --> 5558.84
yeah carve it out and transport it

5603.0 --> 5609.04
right and espe

5604.639 --> 5609.04
when it comes to like digging out

5611.36 --> 5618.5199999999995
caves that's like even more work than

5615.44 --> 5618.5199999999995
cutting out a

5628.159 --> 5633.5599999999995
shape but don't really

5631.4 --> 5636.04
understand what do you not understand

5633.56 --> 5636.04
about about

5655.36 --> 5659.36
it right

5666.88 --> 5670.8
you don't understand how that would

5673.4 --> 5680.799999999999
work you don't understand how sound

5676.48 --> 5680.799999999999
could transform

5690.52 --> 5696.119000000001
material how could that be how that

5693.119 --> 5698.239
could can be done

5696.119 --> 5699.36
well first off you have to know what

5698.239 --> 5703.44
you're

5699.36 --> 5706.32
doing the knowledge does exist it's just

5703.44 --> 5706.32
not readily

5708.48 --> 5714.239
available I mean if you'd have like a

5711.199 --> 5717.799999999999
bell that could

5714.239 --> 5720.638999999999
literally turn Stone into

5717.8 --> 5723.76
putty that would be kind of an object

5720.639 --> 5725.679
that's massive Hazard and would not be

5723.76 --> 5728.119000000001
allowed to just be in the hands of

5725.679 --> 5730.159
anybody because they could just on a

5728.119 --> 5733.759999999999
whim like ring the bell and then

5730.159 --> 5737.679
suddenly make the building there are in

5733.76 --> 5740.88
collapse so it's kind of logical that

5737.679 --> 5745.4400000000005
those kinds of tools and the knowledge

5740.88 --> 5750.159000000001
of them are very obscured and kept

5745.44 --> 5750.159
away in a vault somewhere

5766.32 --> 5771.08
right as for like levitation yeah that's

5769.159 --> 5773.4
that's a bit of a mystery there's been a

5771.08 --> 5776.719
lot of videos that have come across that

5773.4 --> 5779.28
do sort of make claims about

5776.719 --> 5783.159
it never actually seen anybody

5779.28 --> 5783.159
demonstrate it though

5788.32 --> 5795.5199999999995
or maybe I did and kind of forgot about

5792.04 --> 5797.8
it but I yeah I'm confident enough that

5795.52 --> 5797.8
that

5804.48 --> 5811.0
exists right I

5806.719 --> 5813.679
mean these structures are built they're

5811.0 --> 5816.679
there so

5813.679 --> 5819.32
it must have been possible to achieve

5816.679 --> 5823.08
that and then how would they achieve

5819.32 --> 5827.08
that well if they could just levitate

5823.08 --> 5830.88
massive insanely heavy

5827.08 --> 5833.159
objects and if they could mold Stone

5830.88 --> 5837.400000000001
turn it into putty and turn it into Hard

5833.159 --> 5841.119
Rock again back and forth then that

5837.4 --> 5845.5199999999995
would pretty much make it very

5841.119 --> 5845.5199999999995
feasible to construct these things

5849.04 --> 5853.36
levitations are just no I don't think

5853.6 --> 5858.4400000000005
so I I don't know where you're getting

5855.96 --> 5859.2390000000005
that no no it wouldn't be illusion it

5858.44 --> 5863.4
would

5859.239 --> 5863.4
be like a necessary

5864.239 --> 5871.0
antecedent if you're not capable of

5867.32 --> 5874.759999999999
levitating material of that size then

5871.0 --> 5878.679
you just can't transport it then at all

5874.76 --> 5878.679
like not even remotely a

5882.159 --> 5887.638999999999
chance there nothing to do with

5885.04 --> 5890.08
Illusions like the point is if it is

5887.639 --> 5892.88
Illusions then it just can't be

5890.08 --> 5896.76
transported it's

5892.88 --> 5898.119
done it cannot be done then yeah there's

5896.76 --> 5901.679
no

5898.119 --> 5904.04
devices no mechanical based

5901.679 --> 5906.92
devices that we

5904.04 --> 5907.679
at this time can even construct in order

5906.92 --> 5910.599
to

5907.679 --> 5913.719
transport these kinds of massive

5910.599 --> 5917.360000000001
monolithic Stones like we can't do it

5913.719 --> 5920.0
today yeah so oh it's an illusion well

5917.36 --> 5923.04
then it then it's all just wrong and it

5920.0 --> 5927.119
was never built then but I'm pretty sure

5923.04 --> 5931.239
it was built it's there it's still there

5927.119 --> 5934.44
we still can't transport it but it was

5931.239 --> 5937.28
transported so the only way to do it

5934.44 --> 5937.28
then is through

5950.639 --> 5955.639
levitation right and it would be really

5952.719 --> 5959.88
interesting to find out how I mean maybe

5955.639 --> 5962.96
simatic levitation right maybe

5959.88 --> 5965.92
sound right surround a thing by bells

5962.96 --> 5968.2390000000005
that just perpetually ring that allow

5965.92 --> 5970.52
very specific the bells would have been

5968.239 --> 5973.4
adapted to the specific shape of the

5970.52 --> 5976.040000000001
object that we're trying to levitate and

5973.4 --> 5976.839999999999
then basically continually surrounded by

5976.04 --> 5980.76
a

5976.84 --> 5983.2390000000005
simatic vibrational field that lifts it

5980.76 --> 5983.2390000000005
off the

5985.04 --> 5990.719
ground like that's an idea of how they

5988.239 --> 5990.718999999999
could have done

5992.119 --> 6000.598999999999
it and power can move lar yeah that's

5997.32 --> 6006.36
cute but Manpower can't

6000.599 --> 6010.52
move like a 100 ton monolithic Rock in

6006.36 --> 6014.08
one piece stepen Jarvis it just

6010.52 --> 6015.8
can't I'm very sorry like it doesn't

6014.08 --> 6018.5199999999995
matter how much Manpower you could have

6015.8 --> 6020.2390000000005
like a billion people they wouldn't be

6018.52 --> 6023.320000000001
able to achieve

6020.239 --> 6025.48
it you could have the biggest lifting CR

6023.32 --> 6028.119
brain in the world made purely of

6025.48 --> 6031.718999999999
titanium and tungsten and you'd still

6028.119 --> 6031.719
not be able to live the freaking

6032.32 --> 6040.799999999999
thing yeah doesn't

6036.159 --> 6040.799999999999
matter it's too big it's not

6052.239 --> 6055.239
table

6082.239 --> 6085.239
for

6112.239 --> 6116.199
for for

6167.76 --> 6172.04
the Egyptians were masters of moving

6170.199 --> 6175.119
objects of enormous size are really

6172.04 --> 6175.119
based on what

6175.159 --> 6180.879999999999
based on a bunch

6177.199 --> 6183.32
of theoretical historians that just make

6180.88 --> 6186.76
that claim and agree with one another

6183.32 --> 6189.04
that they could or is it based on actual

6186.76 --> 6193.84
empirical

6189.04 --> 6193.84
data like records of how they did

6198.92 --> 6206.679
it what possible to lift a on ton rock

6203.599 --> 6210.0
with one what the hell does that make

6206.679 --> 6210.0
what kind of a statement is

6222.639 --> 6227.4800000000005
that like what the hell are you

6230.52 --> 6238.0
saying with Leverage

6233.96 --> 6241.76
yeah sure Leverage is always useful but

6238.0 --> 6245.199
I mean leverage isn't going to help you

6241.76 --> 6248.1990000000005
transport a 100 ton monolithic

6245.199 --> 6251.199
Rock for like 50

6248.199 --> 6255.08
miles it's only going to get it off the

6251.199 --> 6255.08
ground a little bit

6277.639 --> 6282.8
hello zpp tappy by the way good to see

6279.8 --> 6282.8
you

6304.639 --> 6311.679
hope everybody's enjoying the

6307.159 --> 6311.679
show that better days

6318.04 --> 6323.599
myself please don't forget the Rogan it

6320.599 --> 6323.599
up

6323.96 --> 6328.8
this one

6326.239 --> 6331.159
right and support me through the PayPal

6328.8 --> 6331.159000000001
or the

6331.199 --> 6336.08
patreon I'm certainly going to strive to

6333.639 --> 6338.32
have better shows than today but I mean

6336.08 --> 6340.719
it's just for some reason the energies

6338.32 --> 6345.08
are just not lighting

6340.719 --> 6349.04
up I started on time then there was a

6345.08 --> 6349.04
gigantic pause

6362.92 --> 6367.8
oh yeah well

6365.159 --> 6370.239
that's that's a cute

6367.8 --> 6372.4800000000005
statement that happy oh we could do

6370.239 --> 6374.239
anything when we're properly motivated

6372.48 --> 6377.638999999999
but it's easier to do it the

6374.239 --> 6381.119
conventional way so you're just going to

6377.639 --> 6383.84
fantasize that you can do everything and

6381.119 --> 6387.04
not actually do everything

6383.84 --> 6390.119000000001
because you're just not going to do

6387.04 --> 6393.159
it yeah so that's like oh yeah I could

6390.119 --> 6394.88
do it but I'm not going to yes so how

6393.159 --> 6396.36
does that prove that you can actually do

6394.88 --> 6400.400000000001
it it

6396.36 --> 6400.4
doesn't it doesn't prove it at

6400.8 --> 6407.4400000000005
all it's a true statement is what that

6404.28 --> 6409.92
is yeah I'm sure it is but it doesn't

6407.44 --> 6413.36
prove that you can actually do it

6409.92 --> 6415.639
though cuz you'd have to actually demon

6413.36 --> 6417.4
demonstrated in order to prove that you

6415.639 --> 6421.119
can do it not just claim oh yeah we

6417.4 --> 6423.04
could do it but we're just not going to

6421.119 --> 6427.679
right

6423.04 --> 6429.92
yes I could fly to the moon right was

6427.679 --> 6432.84
properly motivated but I'm just not

6429.92 --> 6435.8
going to do it cuz it's easier to just

6432.84 --> 6440.2390000000005
not do it

6435.8 --> 6443.360000000001
yeah right I mean that's definitely

6440.239 --> 6446.159
worth investing into and believing

6443.36 --> 6448.639
that leaving that

6446.159 --> 6451.239
statement right I'm just not properly

6448.639 --> 6454.1990000000005
motivated to go to the

6451.239 --> 6456.48
moon right it's not because I can't no

6454.199 --> 6458.239
I'm sure we can it's just that we're not

6456.48 --> 6461.239
going to do it

6458.239 --> 6461.239
though

6466.76 --> 6474.52
right why why is moving I don't know why

6471.0 --> 6477.119
you keep mixing up the U and the i in

6474.52 --> 6480.2390000000005
your spelling Z tappy it's kind of

6477.119 --> 6484.28
ridiculous but yeah why can't you move

6480.239 --> 6488.959999999999
100 ton block well because whatever

6484.28 --> 6491.92
you're going to use even as a leverage

6488.96 --> 6495.719
point it's going to

6491.92 --> 6499.4800000000005
literally like dtif and shatter under

6495.719 --> 6502.199
the very pressure of that kind of

6499.48 --> 6504.5199999999995
weight yeah that's the problem like

6502.199 --> 6506.48
there's lit nothing that you could use

6504.52 --> 6511.8
that's not just going to get crushed by

6506.48 --> 6511.799999999999
the way to the point where it completely

6514.48 --> 6519.04
disintegrates how did they build

6516.679 --> 6522.04
Stonehenge in the

6519.04 --> 6522.04
UK

6523.159 --> 6528.32
uh probably the same way they would

6526.88 --> 6531.159000000001
sonically

6528.32 --> 6533.639
lifted transported perhaps there were

6531.159 --> 6535.199
giants involved

6533.639 --> 6538.599
that would certainly have

6535.199 --> 6538.598999999999
helped with the

6541.48 --> 6547.678999999999
assembly right but those stones are not

6544.32 --> 6547.679
like 100 tons

6548.4 --> 6558.92
each they're heavy but they're not like

6554.0 --> 6563.199
insane they're not like 100 meter tall

6558.92 --> 6565.119
singular monolithic rocks

6563.199 --> 6567.919999999999
they're still really freaking big but

6565.119 --> 6571.04
they're not insanely

6567.92 --> 6574.76
large that's the difference yeah those

6571.04 --> 6576.84
insanely large monolithic rocks like

6574.76 --> 6579.4400000000005
whatever you're going to use to even try

6576.84 --> 6582.4800000000005
to lift them off the ground is going to

6579.44 --> 6585.44
break and just dtif under the pressure

6582.48 --> 6588.839999999999
of it it's just no

6585.44 --> 6592.4
way nothing physical could be

6588.84 --> 6596.04
used it's all going to be disintegrated

6592.4 --> 6596.04
it's too freaking

6604.92 --> 6611.92
big yeah I know yeah you can move large

6609.159 --> 6614.48
blocks counterweights and pivots I know

6611.92 --> 6617.36
all about it yeah but it doesn't work

6614.48 --> 6620.0
with 100 ton

6617.36 --> 6623.5599999999995
rocks or a th000

6620.0 --> 6625.0
tons they're about 25 tons wow damn

6623.56 --> 6626.400000000001
that's that's heavier than I thought

6625.0 --> 6628.88
they were Steven

6626.4 --> 6631.799999999999
Jarvis that's pretty

6628.88 --> 6635.84
insane but I mean there

6631.8 --> 6637.679
are rocks out there in the video too

6635.84 --> 6641.639
that I linked to like in

6637.679 --> 6643.52
China that are literally so big they

6641.639 --> 6647.639
can't be

6643.52 --> 6649.96
weighed like you can't actually weigh

6647.639 --> 6652.32
them you could estimate how how heavy

6649.96 --> 6656.199
they are they cannot be weighed they're

6652.32 --> 6656.199
too too freaking

6675.079 --> 6681.32
big one to five yeah in the pyramids

6678.28 --> 6684.4
right but those are relatively smaller

6681.32 --> 6690.5599999999995
rocks the D I'm not talking about

6684.4 --> 6695.719
pyramid rocks I'm talking about gigantic

6690.56 --> 6695.719
statues like insanely

6708.199 --> 6717.159
fast there are like statues out there

6712.119 --> 6717.159
that are so big like you can't weigh

6717.84 --> 6724.400000000001
them statues that are like 100 m or

6724.84 --> 6731.76
taller like just so freaking big it's

6728.079 --> 6734.0
insane like you can't estimate you can't

6731.76 --> 6737.4800000000005
weigh those

6734.0 --> 6739.32
things they can't even IM imagine how

6737.48 --> 6741.28
those things would be transported

6739.32 --> 6744.5199999999995
literally like they can't imagine how

6741.28 --> 6744.5199999999995
that would have happened

6745.239 --> 6750.239
right there are things that are so big

6747.28 --> 6750.239
it's just too

6771.44 --> 6775.48
big for

6804.679 --> 6808.56
all right St Jaris and stone monkey that

6807.04 --> 6811.44
that's really interesting that stone

6808.56 --> 6813.320000000001
masons know these techniques it's

6811.44 --> 6816.32
certainly

6813.32 --> 6819.159
impressive but I mean at some point like

6816.32 --> 6822.159
the scale of it is just it becomes too

6819.159 --> 6822.159
much

6846.079 --> 6852.84
right unless unless the stone Mason from

6849.4 --> 6855.199
those times were so unbelievably

6852.84 --> 6857.84
experienced that indeed they would just

6855.199 --> 6861.28
like oh just with a bunch of pivots

6857.84 --> 6865.599
and and ropes would have been a lot of

6861.28 --> 6868.88
rope it's like oh yeah could just move a

6865.599 --> 6872.360000000001
1,000 ton

6868.88 --> 6874.28
Rock I can barely imagine that I mean

6872.36 --> 6876.48
maybe they were capable of doing that

6874.28 --> 6879.079
but I mean how how the hell would you do

6876.48 --> 6880.7699999999995
that that that it's just the scale of

6879.079 --> 6884.0199999999995
that is completely

6880.77 --> 6884.02
[Music]

6885.44 --> 6892.5599999999995
insane and like the risks the risks of

6890.199 --> 6894.4
like trying to do that and then what if

6892.56 --> 6896.719
it went wrong and it's like the

6894.4 --> 6900.32
cataclysm would have just been unheard

6896.719 --> 6900.32
of if it went

6904.639 --> 6911.119
wrong so I'd say like no I think they

6908.76 --> 6914.8
probably use something else that

6911.119 --> 6917.639
just creat simatic levitation or

6914.8 --> 6921.159000000001
something something that just made it

6917.639 --> 6924.84
way more table to deal with instead of

6921.159 --> 6924.839999999999
having like insane L

6925.32 --> 6933.239
complicated setups to try to move

6928.88 --> 6933.2390000000005
maneuver these insanely large

6948.4 --> 6953.199
things yeah that's all hyper theoretical

6951.36 --> 6955.119
debatable D it's just saying like oh

6953.199 --> 6958.0
enough people oh enough it will be

6955.119 --> 6960.639
doable yeah except we can't really

6958.0 --> 6963.52
figure out how

6960.639 --> 6966.28
though you could say like just think

6963.52 --> 6968.679
harder you'll be able to oh really well

6966.28 --> 6970.84
they can't and this is people in the

6968.679 --> 6974.4
time when there's Internet available and

6970.84 --> 6976.84
when people kind like you make computers

6974.4 --> 6981.0
do the calculations for them and

6976.84 --> 6983.639
everything and they still can't figure

6981.0 --> 6987.28
it out

6983.639 --> 6987.28
though debatable

6990.56 --> 6996.360000000001
D oh assume thousands have died really

6993.84 --> 6999.84
oh life is sheep based on

6996.36 --> 7002.719
what how do you know that you know that

6999.84 --> 7005.92
because supposed historians tell you

7002.719 --> 7005.92
that that it was like

7006.0 --> 7013.52
that I don't think

7008.96 --> 7013.52
so like it's inefficient

7014.239 --> 7018.959999999999
to have a bunch of people just die in

7016.48 --> 7023.199
the process of of of construction like

7018.96 --> 7023.199
that that's not efficient

7062.84 --> 7067.2390000000005
driven by their

7064.36 --> 7069.92
religion right oh they had motivation to

7067.239 --> 7072.5199999999995
do it

7069.92 --> 7074.96
really like what the hell are you in

7072.52 --> 7074.96
this [Â __Â ]

7081.32 --> 7085.44
on you're just making it

7086.159 --> 7094.759999999999
up in a very sloppy way that is very

7092.079 --> 7095.599
stereotypical of how historians think of

7094.76 --> 7097.84
those

7095.599 --> 7099.400000000001
things right you're just assuming oh

7097.84 --> 7102.96
life was really cheap back there oh

7099.4 --> 7105.32
really was it in a time when

7102.96 --> 7106.52
there wasn't exactly an abundance of

7105.32 --> 7110.84
humans

7106.52 --> 7115.4400000000005
everywhere yeah life was not cheap yeah

7110.84 --> 7119.84
life right now is cheap it's relatively

7115.44 --> 7123.119
cheap to maintain a human being and

7119.84 --> 7126.76
there are lots of them

7123.119 --> 7130.159
yeah it wasn't like that back then why

7126.76 --> 7134.639
would you assume assume life is

7130.159 --> 7138.92
cheap when there wasn't an abundance of

7134.639 --> 7141.76
people like education teaching people a

7138.92 --> 7144.079
craft was way

7141.76 --> 7147.0
harder and food

7144.079 --> 7149.84
production was not as

7147.0 --> 7152.599
efficient or maybe it was like but I

7149.84 --> 7154.52
mean not to the like there wouldn't have

7152.599 --> 7156.32
been just an abundance of people like

7154.52 --> 7158.119000000001
that like you're just

7156.32 --> 7160.5199999999995
assuming these

7158.119 --> 7165.04
things assuming that life would have

7160.52 --> 7165.040000000001
been cheap based on

7179.28 --> 7184.0
what we better believe in some history

7182.96 --> 7188.079
or we

7184.0 --> 7190.88
can what believe in what some historians

7188.079 --> 7194.04
tell you about how it was or we can

7190.88 --> 7194.04
improve the future

7194.119 --> 7200.44
really how about we just stop assuming

7198.04 --> 7205.119
the hor [Â __Â ] that has been imposed upon

7200.44 --> 7205.119
us about the past and get

7217.28 --> 7222.92
real yeah people had much harder work

7220.96 --> 7225.079
they worked hard and got very little

7222.92 --> 7226.8
return yeah so how does that make life

7225.079 --> 7229.719
cheap Z

7226.8 --> 7232.76
happy it doesn't make like life cheap

7229.719 --> 7236.4800000000005
that does exactly the opposite if work

7232.76 --> 7238.599
is that hard then labor would have been

7236.48 --> 7242.159
incredibly

7238.599 --> 7245.159000000001
valuable because you need a lot of it

7242.159 --> 7247.5199999999995
it's very tough on them you want to

7245.159 --> 7250.92
accommodate for them what life is cheap

7247.52 --> 7252.52
oh just let them work themselves to

7250.92 --> 7254.599
death I mean I'm sure that's going to

7252.52 --> 7257.56
motivate

7254.599 --> 7259.4400000000005
them right and then you don't have the

7257.56 --> 7261.8
workers anymore so if something goes

7259.44 --> 7264.199
wrong it's like oh oops well we

7261.8 --> 7267.1990000000005
sacrificed half our workers to hurry it

7264.199 --> 7269.879999999999
up a bit and now the project went wrong

7267.199 --> 7273.32
so we can't finish it now yeah no

7269.88 --> 7277.159000000001
nothing about that setup actually tells

7273.32 --> 7277.159
you that life was cheap at

7277.599 --> 7282.84
all labor was precious

7290.599 --> 7296.679
rare life was cheap in more recent

7293.0 --> 7299.04
history oh I believe that one sure in

7296.679 --> 7302.0
recent history definitely and that's

7299.04 --> 7306.0
more logical because there's a bigger

7302.0 --> 7307.639
population and it's easier and cheaper

7306.0 --> 7310.639
to provide

7307.639 --> 7312.8
food yeah easier and cheaper it is to

7310.639 --> 7316.0
provide food the more population there

7312.8 --> 7318.360000000001
is yeah then life becomes cheaper huh

7316.0 --> 7320.84
because oh suddenly it's much easier to

7318.36 --> 7323.719
replace somebody it's much easier to

7320.84 --> 7326.599
just like start from scratch with

7323.719 --> 7332.04
somebody re-educate them provide food

7326.599 --> 7335.4800000000005
it's cheaper to do that which makes life

7332.04 --> 7340.96
cheaper yeah in the ancient

7335.48 --> 7343.199
past not not cheaper less people harder

7340.96 --> 7348.159
to provide the food harder to provide

7343.199 --> 7351.5199999999995
the education not cheap very

7348.159 --> 7354.598999999999
expensive a human being with capable

7351.52 --> 7357.96
labor would have been a expensive

7354.599 --> 7360.1990000000005
commodity that would have been protected

7357.96 --> 7360.199
and

7360.32 --> 7367.799999999999
treasured because if you lost it you

7363.52 --> 7367.8
could barely replace it

7372.639 --> 7379.04
not being paid or

7376.639 --> 7381.52
whatever they have to survive at least

7379.04 --> 7382.639
the bable d whether they were paid to do

7381.52 --> 7386.320000000001
it or

7382.639 --> 7390.4800000000005
not they would have had to had the right

7386.32 --> 7394.119
food in order for them not to exhaust

7390.48 --> 7398.5199999999995
themselves to be capable to keep

7394.119 --> 7398.5199999999995
applying Quality Labor

7412.079 --> 7417.599
what Steven JIS meant by Cheap yeah but

7414.76 --> 7419.52
it's not really that cheap if they have

7417.599 --> 7422.400000000001
to have

7419.52 --> 7424.599
skills it's not going to be that cheap

7422.4 --> 7425.679
like how are you going to replace the

7424.599 --> 7428.559
actual

7425.679 --> 7433.599
skill yeah skill takes

7428.559 --> 7438.52
time someone has to survive

7433.599 --> 7438.52
and thrive in order to build that

7442.28 --> 7447.199
skill yeah if you just keep throwing

7445.0 --> 7450.32
people at it and they just keep dying

7447.199 --> 7452.919999999999
very quickly guess what nobody's going

7450.32 --> 7455.4
to have that skill and nobody's going to

7452.92 --> 7459.2390000000005
even be able to teach anybody else that

7455.4 --> 7462.36
skill because they all die too quickly

7459.239 --> 7465.159
yeah it doesn't work

7462.36 --> 7465.159
it doesn't

7466.84 --> 7472.32
work

7469.159 --> 7475.48
yeah construction

7472.32 --> 7477.4
architecture slave labor it doesn't work

7475.48 --> 7479.598999999999
I mean if you're going to like Quarry

7477.4 --> 7481.44
mine right if you Quarry something do

7479.599 --> 7482.96
you mine something yeah you could

7481.44 --> 7485.28
probably do that because it doesn't

7482.96 --> 7487.52
really require a lot of skill you just

7485.28 --> 7489.8
put them in shackles and you just let

7487.52 --> 7491.1990000000005
them dig until they're dead and then if

7489.8 --> 7494.599
they're dead you replace them with

7491.199 --> 7497.839999999999
somebody else it doesn't really require

7494.599 --> 7502.4800000000005
skill yeah

7497.84 --> 7506.639
crafting oh yeah oh yes does that

7502.48 --> 7508.919999999999
require skill yeah you can't just use

7506.639 --> 7512.079
slaves that you

7508.92 --> 7515.719
expend cuz then they're not going to

7512.079 --> 7520.32
build the skill that you

7515.719 --> 7520.32
need think about it

7527.96 --> 7532.199
yeah that's right Victorian times they

7530.36 --> 7534.639
did yeah they did all those terrible

7532.199 --> 7534.638999999999
things I

7536.92 --> 7545.2390000000005
know yeah but

7539.599 --> 7548.639
that's F that's machine factories that's

7545.239 --> 7550.4
that's something that's not there in

7548.639 --> 7553.400000000001
ancient times it's like

7550.4 --> 7553.4
industrialization

7553.44 --> 7560.28
yeah that you industrialization

7555.88 --> 7564.04
specifically was there so that skill was

7560.28 --> 7567.559
no longer needed for complicated

7564.04 --> 7571.48
craft that was the entire point of

7567.559 --> 7573.679
it that made the labor very cheap and

7571.48 --> 7574.839999999999
like accidents would happen and nobody

7573.679 --> 7577.28
gave a

7574.84 --> 7578.96
[Â __Â ] because you didn't need anybody

7577.28 --> 7582.96
with skill you just needed somebody to

7578.96 --> 7588.4
do it until things went wrong

7582.96 --> 7591.8
yeah they didn't have industrialized

7588.4 --> 7594.48
factories in the ancient Egyptian times

7591.8 --> 7598.159000000001
in order to build the pyramids that was

7594.48 --> 7601.4
all craft

7598.159 --> 7603.679
based it's

7601.4 --> 7607.759999999999
craft yeah

7603.679 --> 7611.159
not industrialized factories it's a very

7607.76 --> 7611.159000000001
different scenario

7615.239 --> 7617.44
get

7640.52 --> 7644.4800000000005
it for

7674.88 --> 7679.639
H right is anybody going to rogans up

7677.52 --> 7682.1990000000005
the show I mean it's kind of interesting

7679.639 --> 7682.1990000000005
now this

7687.079 --> 7692.719
discussion hope you guys appreciate it I

7689.76 --> 7694.280000000001
do thank you for actually like having a

7692.719 --> 7696.36
subject that can be

7694.28 --> 7699.36
discussed that's kind of nice for a

7696.36 --> 7699.36
change

7714.0 --> 7717.88
just

7716.239 --> 7722.839999999999
roked

7717.88 --> 7722.84
right thank you for that Steve Jarvis

7733.599 --> 7736.599
I

7768.599 --> 7773.92
right anybody if you could support me

7771.639 --> 7779.119
that would be great please donate to my

7773.92 --> 7782.639
PayPal specifically that would be very

7779.119 --> 7782.639
helpful keep me

7782.92 --> 7786.4800000000005
going got some

7787.079 --> 7793.32
bills need to be able to eat until

7793.679 --> 7800.159
is

7795.8 --> 7803.599
it minimum 2 weeks from

7800.159 --> 7805.719
now so any support through the PayPal

7803.599 --> 7808.52
would be extremely helpful you can also

7805.719 --> 7808.52
become part of my

7809.639 --> 7815.1990000000005
patreon most importantly you could just

7812.32 --> 7815.199
come part of my

7818.119 --> 7826.28
chat I have an interesting discussion

7820.84 --> 7826.28
about things like we have

7851.96 --> 7856.679
right could talk about ancient

7854.52 --> 7861.88
architecture we could talk about Flat

7856.679 --> 7861.88
Earth why the Earth is measurably flat

7886.48 --> 7894.0
right we can talk about food talk about

7890.079 --> 7896.639
plants and nature alternative

7894.0 --> 7899.559
medicine there's a lot about alternative

7896.639 --> 7902.8
medicine that I that I can talk

7899.559 --> 7905.639
about right as as long

7902.8 --> 7909.2390000000005
as when it comes to things that I'm

7905.639 --> 7912.28
against I don't name anything beyond

7909.239 --> 7915.079
medical experiments don't get more

7912.28 --> 7916.559
specific than that and then it's all

7915.079 --> 7921.558999999999
good and all

7916.559 --> 7925.4400000000005
safe how old do I believe humanity

7921.559 --> 7925.4400000000005
is clutch what a

7931.639 --> 7937.2390000000005
question I I have no idea

7945.079 --> 7949.639
it all depends on what you define as

7947.239 --> 7952.36
Humanity I mean I don't think that the

7949.639 --> 7957.559
form that we're in right

7952.36 --> 7961.28
now really even resembles the original

7957.559 --> 7966.079000000001
Humanity I think we're all way

7961.28 --> 7966.079
smaller way less

7968.44 --> 7974.36
efficient have less spiritual ability

7977.28 --> 7983.119
naturally and probably with reason I

7980.84 --> 7985.639
mean I don't like the the original

7983.119 --> 7988.5199999999995
Humanity how things started out would

7985.639 --> 7990.52
have had just much better more optimal

7988.52 --> 7992.559
conditions available for them to

7990.52 --> 7995.4400000000005
function on that

7992.559 --> 7997.8
level well what we're left with now is

7995.44 --> 8003.119
just

7997.8 --> 8003.119000000001
less less pressure less oxygen less

8003.36 --> 8005.719
Life

8007.0 --> 8011.159
Energy I mean there's still some and it

8009.32 --> 8013.44
could even become more but I mean it's

8011.159 --> 8013.44
it's

8014.559 --> 8019.320000000001
lessened and so what originally would

8017.199 --> 8023.558999999999
have been Humanity would have

8019.32 --> 8025.44
been probably three times as tall as as

8023.559 --> 8027.04
as humans are right now and that was

8025.44 --> 8029.32
just an

8027.04 --> 8032.239
average right that wouldn't even have

8029.32 --> 8035.92
been the Giants they would have just we

8032.239 --> 8035.919999999999
humans would have all been way

8040.599 --> 8045.4400000000005
taller there's evidence of little fellas

8044.36 --> 8050.04
fishing

8045.44 --> 8050.04
over right I'm sure there

8055.599 --> 8064.119000000001
is based on what exactly

8059.239 --> 8067.678999999999
marxy but based on fossils based on

8064.119 --> 8067.679
carbonating I don't think

8073.36 --> 8078.36
so right so how old is the current form

8077.4 --> 8081.719
of

8078.36 --> 8084.0
humanity probably a couple of thousand

8081.719 --> 8084.0
years

8089.639 --> 8097.32
old you could argue that

8092.44 --> 8100.199
the yeah that we were created After the

8097.32 --> 8104.199
flood the new form of humanity I mean

8100.199 --> 8107.598999999999
this is just a rough

8104.199 --> 8109.879999999999
idea but I mean let's just say the

8107.599 --> 8112.719
ancient Egyptians the ones that actually

8109.88 --> 8114.8
made all this stuff the pre- flood

8112.719 --> 8117.079
civilization

8114.8 --> 8121.079000000001
probably

8117.079 --> 8125.199
redesigned themselves

8121.079 --> 8128.599
like their Gene their life blueprint and

8125.199 --> 8131.638999999999
created the next form of humanity which

8128.599 --> 8131.639
would have been more

8134.159 --> 8141.0
efficient easier to deal with how the

8137.84 --> 8146.119000000001
world is etc etc reshaped it into the

8141.0 --> 8146.119
form that we're yeah that we're in all

8147.4 --> 8152.839999999999
now but like the previous form of human

8151.32 --> 8158.119
would have

8152.84 --> 8160.92
been could be very old who knows how

8158.119 --> 8163.199
old and that would have even have been

8160.92 --> 8166.04
the original

8163.199 --> 8168.96
form I think that the original form of

8166.04 --> 8171.84
Adam was like

8168.96 --> 8174.639
huge so we could have gone through like

8171.84 --> 8179.639
potentially thousands of

8174.639 --> 8184.400000000001
Cycles thousands of transitional Cycles

8179.639 --> 8187.079
one type of Humanity into the

8184.4 --> 8190.159
other which would mean like potentially

8187.079 --> 8193.88
Humanity in it from its original Vantage

8190.159 --> 8197.16
Point could be like a million years

8193.88 --> 8197.16
old or

8197.399 --> 8204.88
more starting out with Adam huge huge

8202.679 --> 8206.639
giant

8204.88 --> 8211.518999999998
Titan

8206.639 --> 8213.24
huge and then every generation

8211.519 --> 8218.0
slightly

8213.24 --> 8220.639
smaller or half half of that and then

8218.0 --> 8224.24
eventually ending up with a certain type

8220.639 --> 8227.598999999998
of protohuman the original form that was

8224.24 --> 8229.119999999999
really really big still that would have

8227.599 --> 8232.12
been there for a

8229.12 --> 8234.76
while and then later smaller types of

8232.12 --> 8238.04
humans would come out of that would be

8234.76 --> 8242.679
recreated and then the older Humanity

8238.04 --> 8242.679
would be regarded as Giants

8243.519 --> 8247.479
in

8244.519 --> 8249.399
comparison and so the shift of what

8247.479 --> 8252.639
Humanity would have been would keep

8249.399 --> 8256.199999999999
shifting around over the

8252.639 --> 8260.16
ages over vast periods of

8256.2 --> 8261.359
time and the original humans were super

8260.16 --> 8263.519
long

8261.359 --> 8264.960000000001
lived I mean this is even like

8263.519 --> 8268.08
biblically

8264.96 --> 8270.518999999998
recorded that they lived incredibly long

8268.08 --> 8273.439
lives like insanely long thousands of

8270.519 --> 8274.639000000001
years potentially or a thousand years

8273.439 --> 8276.399
something like

8274.639 --> 8281.24
that

8276.399 --> 8281.24
and that's how I think it roughly

8298.679 --> 8303.719000000001
happened right so it's all about like

8301.679 --> 8307.76
Humanity in what

8303.719 --> 8307.759999999998
form because it would have been

8308.0 --> 8315.2
recreated or downgraded even downgraded

8312.399 --> 8319.519
into smaller more

8315.2 --> 8322.319000000001
efficient shorter lifespan smaller more

8319.519 --> 8327.599
efficient shorter lifespan and just keep

8322.319 --> 8327.599
recreating humans like that

8337.16 --> 8342.08
right and even like with the shorter

8339.359 --> 8346.04
lifespan it would then naturally cause

8342.08 --> 8348.039999999999
those humans to basically develop

8346.04 --> 8349.800000000001
quicker because of their shorter

8348.04 --> 8352.719000000001
lifespan it's like their shorter

8349.8 --> 8356.119999999999
lifespan would make their conscious

8352.719 --> 8358.839999999998
experience time more

8356.12 --> 8361.719000000001
rapidly right just like a mouse lives

8358.84 --> 8364.399
incredibly short but it lives a full

8361.719 --> 8369.598999999998
life like it will experience that short

8364.399 --> 8369.599
time as a full life and so do

8371.96 --> 8378.358999999999
we despite our relatively short lifetime

8376.28 --> 8380.92
compared to the

8378.359 --> 8383.08
Ancients right so that that's how I look

8380.92 --> 8383.08
at

8388.04 --> 8394.2
it stepen JIS just

8391.399 --> 8397.96
don't just don't do that

8394.2 --> 8400.479000000001
that's something inexcusably stupid to

8397.96 --> 8404.8
State something like

8400.479 --> 8407.16
that yeah Globe believer so you have to

8404.8 --> 8409.679999999998
go with science yeah the globe is not

8407.16 --> 8409.68
science

8410.56 --> 8416.8
and Globe belief is not science I mean

8414.2 --> 8418.640000000001
it's belief is not science science is a

8416.8 --> 8421.64
method and has nothing to do with

8418.64 --> 8421.64
anything

8422.28 --> 8427.640000000001
you're literally talking about science

8425.04 --> 8427.640000000001
like it's a

8428.52 --> 8434.16
religion that's really stupid to let

8431.24 --> 8434.16
that come out of your

8437.479 --> 8443.479
mouth don't believe in that type of

8441.12 --> 8446.640000000001
evolution what are you talking about

8443.479 --> 8448.599999999999
Evolution I'm I did not mention

8446.64 --> 8451.84
Evolution at

8448.6 --> 8454.56
all there is no evolution

8451.84 --> 8458.28
and even adaptation has very little to

8454.56 --> 8460.519999999999
do with it I mean animals in nature

8458.28 --> 8464.16
adapt they

8460.52 --> 8465.640000000001
adapt yeah when I'm talking about the

8464.16 --> 8468.0
different types of

8465.64 --> 8470.199999999999
humans that originally started with

8468.0 --> 8473.319
giants it has nothing to do with

8470.2 --> 8476.68
Evolution or adaptation no that has to

8473.319 --> 8476.68
do with

8476.92 --> 8482.56
redesigning yeah that means humans

8483.68 --> 8490.68
reengineering

8486.28 --> 8494.880000000001
humans and then the next version

8490.68 --> 8496.720000000001
eventually figures it out and then they

8494.88 --> 8500.64
re-engineer

8496.72 --> 8502.8
humans and humans keep

8500.64 --> 8506.358999999999
re-engineering

8502.8 --> 8509.599999999999
themselves and arguably the more they do

8506.359 --> 8515.56
so the more of the original design is

8509.6 --> 8515.56
lost leading to Shorter lifespan being

8516.6 --> 8522.800000000001
smaller but because of being smaller

8520.479 --> 8524.24
being more efficient with the en yeah

8522.8 --> 8527.438999999998
with the

8524.24 --> 8530.039999999999
environment that's how I believe that

8527.439 --> 8532.04
that's working there's no natural

8530.04 --> 8534.68
adaptation it's not like oh the

8532.04 --> 8536.880000000001
atmosphere oh I'm breathing less well so

8534.68 --> 8539.0
my offspring are going to be smaller no

8536.88 --> 8542.519999999999
absolutely

8539.0 --> 8548.399
not absolutely

8542.52 --> 8548.399000000001
not they would have been actively

8548.96 --> 8556.679999999998
re-engineered by

8551.72 --> 8562.92
humans yeah God made

8556.68 --> 8566.319
Adam the original human a colossal

8562.92 --> 8568.319
Giant and then at some point his

8566.319 --> 8572.039999999999
offspring would have

8568.319 --> 8575.64
re-engineered humans

8572.04 --> 8578.28
into a smaller version that's like

8575.64 --> 8578.279999999999
easier to

8579.6 --> 8584.800000000001
procreate and then

8581.6 --> 8586.640000000001
eventually those among those humans

8584.8 --> 8589.358999999999
cataclysms would

8586.64 --> 8591.119999999999
happen and then the environment changes

8589.359 --> 8593.84
and they're like

8591.12 --> 8595.52
[Â __Â ] I guess we have to re-engineer

8593.84 --> 8598.960000000001
humans to be able

8595.52 --> 8601.319000000001
to to thrive in in how the environment

8598.96 --> 8604.119999999999
is changed

8601.319 --> 8606.88
yeah it's not a natural adaptation

8604.12 --> 8610.800000000001
that's literally

8606.88 --> 8610.8
reengineering that's how I think it

8623.88 --> 8630.24
happen I know you're responding to

8626.16 --> 8630.24
stepen clutch that's cool

8631.0 --> 8637.6
I'm I'm just giving you my input about

8633.0 --> 8637.6
it this is how I see

8637.8 --> 8643.92
it no I mean adaptation is a thing but

8641.319 --> 8646.88
that's that's what happens in nature I

8643.92 --> 8648.84
think that humans re-engineer the next

8646.88 --> 8651.479
type of

8648.84 --> 8653.52
humans I think that's happened a couple

8651.479 --> 8657.519999999999
of

8653.52 --> 8657.52
times right

8671.279 --> 8677.84
larger evolutionary patterns no there is

8675.64 --> 8681.56
no Evolution

8677.84 --> 8681.56
debatable does not

8682.68 --> 8688.359
exist yeah the idea of evolution is

8685.88 --> 8692.199999999999
based on mutation mutation is

8688.359 --> 8692.2
information loss

8693.359 --> 8699.6
yeah all mutation natural mutation

8697.76 --> 8701.92
leads

8699.6 --> 8704.76
infertility mental

8701.92 --> 8709.12
dysfunction and shorter

8704.76 --> 8711.439
lifespan so mutation definitely not

8709.12 --> 8713.04
definitely not leading to anything

8711.439 --> 8716.04
constructive or

8713.04 --> 8718.2
surviving yeah the only way to do that

8716.04 --> 8722.2
is to

8718.2 --> 8722.2
reengineer it

8722.6 --> 8730.880000000001
to redesign it not to let

8727.399 --> 8732.96
random errors slip in to ruin the

8730.88 --> 8735.16
overall design and make it

8732.96 --> 8739.479
nonfunctional yeah that's

8735.16 --> 8739.479
not how humans would have

8740.52 --> 8747.76
survived yeah evolution is a nonsense

8744.399 --> 8750.519999999999
Theory it doesn't work it it doesn't

8747.76 --> 8755.64
technically work

8750.52 --> 8761.08
it's based on false insights and false

8755.64 --> 8761.08
principles yeah things that mutate die

8775.64 --> 8781.319
out no impossible for that's interesting

8778.84 --> 8784.0
Steven Jarvis I mean yeah

8781.319 --> 8787.64
sure but that has to do with like

8784.0 --> 8787.64
hormones and everything that's just

8799.24 --> 8807.64
inherent oh BR C oh what oh debat the I

8804.359 --> 8812.640000000001
have to tell you how they did it oh

8807.64 --> 8816.16
really do I do I have to tell you you a

8812.64 --> 8817.119999999999
well no no I don't cuz I don't know how

8816.16 --> 8821.72
they did

8817.12 --> 8824.720000000001
it yeah I can just tell you that I find

8821.72 --> 8827.56
that the most logical

8824.72 --> 8832.88
solution and they would have been

8827.56 --> 8832.88
capable of doing that re-engineering

8832.96 --> 8842.96
it changing the blueprint yeah mutation

8837.64 --> 8845.8
in evolution is by random happen

8842.96 --> 8850.599999999999
stance that's the entire idea behind

8845.8 --> 8853.599999999999
darwinian Evolution that random mutation

8850.6 --> 8856.76
would lead to an improved design which

8853.6 --> 8856.76
is absolutely

8859.479 --> 8863.679999999998
nonsensical because that's not what

8861.279 --> 8864.960000000001
mutation is mutation is always the loss

8863.68 --> 8866.68
of

8864.96 --> 8870.88
information

8866.68 --> 8873.479000000001
right it it doesn't lead to in improved

8870.88 --> 8876.08
design it doesn't do that right if you

8873.479 --> 8880.599999999999
want an improved

8876.08 --> 8880.6
design you're going to have to design

8880.76 --> 8887.12
it an intelligent being will have to

8884.04 --> 8889.160000000002
design it then and I think that humans

8887.12 --> 8893.439
may have been

8889.16 --> 8893.439
re-engineered by humans

8902.88 --> 8909.839999999998
yes I know clutch yeah now that that

8905.6 --> 8912.720000000001
idea of evolution from a microorganism

8909.84 --> 8913.92
to a a large fast complicated organism

8912.72 --> 8916.679999999998
is

8913.92 --> 8919.76
ridiculous it is absolutely

8916.68 --> 8921.76
absurd to think that especially once you

8919.76 --> 8925.479
realize that a large

8921.76 --> 8928.279
organism has those smaller organisms in

8925.479 --> 8932.039999999999
them as part of their function then it

8928.279 --> 8932.04
makes it even more absurd

8970.279 --> 8974.08
the [Â __Â ] are you whining about debatable

8978.12 --> 8985.640000000001
D things that mutate die out proof

8982.2 --> 8988.12
evidence citation research white

8985.64 --> 8993.0
Pap

8988.12 --> 8997.12
uh why didn't you try to find any white

8993.0 --> 8997.12
papers that contradict

8997.24 --> 9004.279
that because things that do mutate die

9000.439 --> 9008.0
out it's mutation is literally a loss of

9004.279 --> 9012.52
information that you don't get

9008.0 --> 9012.52
back yeah mutation is

9013.2 --> 9018.92
damage this is kind of widely known I

9016.88 --> 9021.839999999998
mean if you need a citation what you

9018.92 --> 9025.24
need a citation for the word what you

9021.84 --> 9029.04
need a citation for the

9025.24 --> 9032.24
word it I mean seriously go [Â __Â ]

9029.04 --> 9032.240000000002
yourself debatable

9039.76 --> 9046.64
D long periods of no debatable if you

9043.24 --> 9049.52
are a serious Evolution

9046.64 --> 9050.88
[Â __Â ] then you just need to shut the [Â __Â ]

9049.52 --> 9054.12
up

9050.88 --> 9056.438999999998
it's so [Â __Â ] dumbb I don't even want

9054.12 --> 9059.6
to have you in my chat blabbering on

9056.439 --> 9061.52
that absolute

9059.6 --> 9063.359
retardation I don't want to have a

9061.52 --> 9065.08
discussion with you about it it's so

9063.359 --> 9066.960000000001
[Â __Â ] dumb I don't want to have a

9065.08 --> 9070.439
discussion with you about

9066.96 --> 9073.96
it I don't give a [Â __Â ] if you want more

9070.439 --> 9073.960000000001
information go [Â __Â ]

9075.08 --> 9080.12
yourself yeah you go and find that more

9077.88 --> 9082.679999999998
information

9080.12 --> 9084.92
it's plenty out there gave already gave

9082.68 --> 9086.720000000001
you all the pointers I'm not going to

9084.92 --> 9089.56
provide you with the sources I'm not

9086.72 --> 9091.96
going to set you up with the library so

9089.56 --> 9094.88
that you can figure it out you could

9091.96 --> 9097.479
have already done that yourself

9094.88 --> 9100.358999999999
instead you're an evolution

9097.479 --> 9102.76
[Â __Â ] you have been all these

9100.359 --> 9106.68
years yeah when I've brought this kind

9102.76 --> 9110.92
of subject up for a decade and it's been

9106.68 --> 9113.64
out there for decades

9110.92 --> 9117.88
yeah you go figure it

9113.64 --> 9121.119999999999
out and don't put me to work because

9117.88 --> 9123.92
you're too stupid to figure it out for

9121.12 --> 9127.52
yourself

9123.92 --> 9131.76
yeah gave you all the points you need

9127.52 --> 9131.76
now you go figure it out

9144.6 --> 9152.08
yeah you want to be an evolution [Â __Â ]

9147.96 --> 9153.88
[Â __Â ] with your proof and your papers

9152.08 --> 9155.84
you go get your [Â __Â ] proof and your

9153.88 --> 9158.96
papers and you shove them up your ass

9155.84 --> 9161.04
and light them on fire I don't give a

9158.96 --> 9163.319
[Â __Â ] you believe in evolution it's

9161.04 --> 9167.439
[Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] there is no actual

9163.319 --> 9170.119999999999
evidence for it it's not even a theory

9167.439 --> 9172.720000000001
it's officially unproven still to this

9170.12 --> 9175.84
day despite there being an enormous

9172.72 --> 9178.199999999999
amount of unbelievable religious [Â __Â ]

9175.84 --> 9180.72
retards that still believe in it that

9178.2 --> 9185.08
still claim it's real despite their

9180.72 --> 9186.679999999998
officially not being evidence for it and

9185.08 --> 9188.439
I don't want to [Â __Â ] deal with those

9186.68 --> 9192.08
retards at

9188.439 --> 9195.12
all yeah just like I don't want to deal

9192.08 --> 9197.6
with religious

9195.12 --> 9199.76
Fanatics that believe in nonsense

9197.6 --> 9201.16
riddles that are literally self

9199.76 --> 9202.08
contradicting I don't want to deal with

9201.16 --> 9205.479
those

9202.08 --> 9209.6
either so if that's where you stand with

9205.479 --> 9211.599999999999
that [Â __Â ] do you go stand somewhere else

9209.6 --> 9214.2
debatable

9211.6 --> 9218.279
D

9214.2 --> 9218.279
yeah because I don't want to deal with

9221.319 --> 9228.119999999999
you yeah you keep your Evolution [Â __Â ]

9224.56 --> 9228.119999999999
beliefs to yourself

9248.72 --> 9257.64
Darwin reced Darwin is is a

9253.64 --> 9257.64
complete ass

9267.56 --> 9274.24
I mean it's dude I don't want to discuss

9270.439 --> 9277.56
it it's [Â __Â ] mainstream it's

9274.24 --> 9281.08
mainstream that evolution is bunk okay

9277.56 --> 9282.72
it's mainstream I I don't want to get

9281.08 --> 9286.319
into that

9282.72 --> 9288.119999999999
[Â __Â ] it's like just go to Kent Hoven

9286.319 --> 9291.24
you'll have super

9288.12 --> 9293.880000000001
elaborate like evidence backed

9291.24 --> 9297.0
presentations explain to you exactly why

9293.88 --> 9301.479
and it'll even draw [Â __Â ] ball [Â __Â ]

9297.0 --> 9304.2
belief into it yeah even with

9301.479 --> 9308.64
that evolution is

9304.2 --> 9311.6
fake it's an archaic Eugenics based

9308.64 --> 9315.319
concept that is absolutely

9311.6 --> 9316.84
nonsense there is no actual evidence for

9315.319 --> 9320.479
it and that's

9316.84 --> 9324.24
official and if you're an evolution

9320.479 --> 9326.519999999999
believer well then you're a religious

9324.24 --> 9329.84
nutcase that believes in things for

9326.52 --> 9333.319000000001
which there is absolutely no

9329.84 --> 9338.24
evidence and I don't want to deal with

9333.319 --> 9342.0
you not about that I really

9338.24 --> 9344.76
don't yeah just like I I don't want to

9342.0 --> 9350.0
have back and forth discussions with

9344.76 --> 9352.92
people that insist on Jesus being part

9350.0 --> 9355.0
of a trinity and that that means this

9352.92 --> 9358.08
and this means that and it's all

9355.0 --> 9359.359
self-contradicting and yeah I really

9358.08 --> 9362.8
really don't want to have that

9359.359 --> 9365.56
discussion because it's a waste of my

9362.8 --> 9370.599999999999
time and it's like human

9365.56 --> 9376.24
unworthy and so is the idiotic

9370.6 --> 9381.439
archaic 18th century belief of

9376.24 --> 9385.6
evolution to even call it a theory is a

9381.439 --> 9388.359
mockery yeah it's a nonsense concept has

9385.6 --> 9391.960000000001
been widely recognized as being a

9388.359 --> 9395.56
nonsense concept over which tons of

9391.96 --> 9399.08
teachers in schools have objected being

9395.56 --> 9402.72
forced to teach it to kids for like a

9399.08 --> 9407.16
century and before that even yeah that's

9402.72 --> 9410.599999999999
how much of a nonsense concept it

9407.16 --> 9413.92
is evolution is nonsense

9410.6 --> 9417.2
there is no evidence for evolution

9413.92 --> 9419.960000000001
whatsoever yeah I mean it's got own

9417.2 --> 9422.2
freaking South Park episode that mocks

9419.96 --> 9425.599999999999
it exactly to the level that it needs to

9422.2 --> 9425.6
be mocked for crying out

9425.88 --> 9433.039999999999
loud if you believe that you're

9429.6 --> 9436.04
[Â __Â ] there's no excuse you're just

9433.04 --> 9436.04
[Â __Â ]

9447.479 --> 9452.519999999999
share DNA yeah you know what you also

9449.64 --> 9454.96
share your DNA with Steven

9452.52 --> 9459.6
Jaris yeah you know what you score

9454.96 --> 9461.72
really high DNA comparison yeah worms

9459.6 --> 9468.0
yeah earth worms

9461.72 --> 9470.76
yeah massive DNA match right I mean DNA

9468.0 --> 9473.88
oh it means so much oh DNA proves this

9470.76 --> 9479.24
and that no no it doesn't

9473.88 --> 9479.24
yeah like you don't even know what DNA

9479.6 --> 9488.640000000001
is as in nobody really knows what DNA

9485.08 --> 9493.24
is yeah matches you can use it as

9488.64 --> 9496.0
a as an identification match just like a

9493.24 --> 9499.08
fingerprint does that mean that we know

9496.0 --> 9501.96
exactly from the fingerprint we can

9499.08 --> 9505.68
derive exactly what type of human design

9501.96 --> 9510.56
we are based on our unique

9505.68 --> 9513.24
fingerprint no no you don't not at all

9510.56 --> 9516.319
not even close yeah same goes for

9513.24 --> 9518.6
genetics yeah oh unique genetic print oh

9516.319 --> 9521.399
there's this certain traits that are

9518.6 --> 9525.12
associated with this type of genetic

9521.399 --> 9529.24
Peak here and there that's interesting

9525.12 --> 9531.560000000001
right oh a lot of it seems to match with

9529.24 --> 9534.399
a completely other

9531.56 --> 9538.76
reconstructed thing another design that

9534.399 --> 9541.24
seems to match yeah well that's because

9538.76 --> 9546.279
it's like the same building blocks but

9541.24 --> 9549.52
that doesn't mean that it seeming to be

9546.279 --> 9553.6
similar has anything to do with it

9549.52 --> 9556.720000000001
actually being related in design yeah

9553.6 --> 9559.52
just because the same tools were used in

9556.72 --> 9563.599999999999
the design of it genetics doesn't mean

9559.52 --> 9565.6
that it's derived or originated from the

9563.6 --> 9569.2
same

9565.6 --> 9572.479000000001
blueprint not at all yeah this is a

9569.2 --> 9576.6
correlation not causation

9572.479 --> 9578.96
issue yeah yeah 70% so do you think that

9576.6 --> 9582.12
we're

9578.96 --> 9587.039999999999
70% worms

9582.12 --> 9591.720000000001
then it's it's all nonsensical

9587.04 --> 9593.399000000001
dude 70% match it doesn't mean

9591.72 --> 9597.56
anything

9593.399 --> 9597.56
98% match doesn't mean

9597.76 --> 9602.2
anything correlation not causation like

9600.72 --> 9604.76
you don't even know what freaking

9602.2 --> 9604.76
genetics

9607.359 --> 9612.640000000001
are yeah I mean what we're taught about

9610.6 --> 9615.6
genetics is

9612.64 --> 9616.76
nonsense there's claims being made about

9615.6 --> 9619.92
micro

9616.76 --> 9623.399
organel that are literally

9619.92 --> 9627.76
made up made up from

9623.399 --> 9629.24
scratch somebody just had an idea and

9627.76 --> 9631.84
then they just like oh yeah that's

9629.24 --> 9634.76
what's in there no evidence no evidence

9631.84 --> 9638.479
whatsoever no actual empirical evidence

9634.76 --> 9640.960000000001
for it no traces to confirm that that's

9638.479 --> 9644.72
actually the case it's just presupposed

9640.96 --> 9648.16
it's just assumed yeah and that is

9644.72 --> 9651.199999999999
subcellular biology most of it is

9648.16 --> 9654.96
completely made up

9651.2 --> 9658.800000000001
yeah they could get something that we

9654.96 --> 9661.0
Rec recognize as genetics out of cells

9658.8 --> 9665.039999999999
under very specific circumstances and

9661.0 --> 9667.96
then you have all these correlative

9665.04 --> 9670.2
matches like the arrangement of the code

9667.96 --> 9672.119999999999
and it's all very interesting and you

9670.2 --> 9677.319000000001
can like yeah get just like a

9672.12 --> 9680.6
fingerprint you can get that out of it

9677.319 --> 9683.88
right just because everything all the

9680.6 --> 9686.800000000001
biolog biological life has this genetics

9683.88 --> 9688.96
that can be extracted from it and that

9686.8 --> 9691.92
some of the genetics of one species

9688.96 --> 9695.599999999999
seems to match with another species like

9691.92 --> 9698.279
that doesn't mean that they're

9695.6 --> 9699.2
related that they're like literally

9698.279 --> 9702.6
through

9699.2 --> 9705.560000000001
procreation related at any point it

9702.6 --> 9709.800000000001
doesn't mean that at all it just means

9705.56 --> 9713.16
oh it's been designed from scratch with

9709.8 --> 9717.199999999999
the same building blocks that's what

9713.16 --> 9717.2
that means it doesn't mean that it's

9720.04 --> 9723.04
related

9729.439 --> 9736.04
yeah evolution is

9733.0 --> 9740.52
nonsense the entire premise the entire

9736.04 --> 9744.319000000001
train of thinking is nonsense

9740.52 --> 9748.560000000001
yeah we're not all life is not

9744.319 --> 9748.56
originating from the same damn

9759.68 --> 9766.12
thing you can't believe the alternative

9763.2 --> 9768.52
entire being teleporting into existence

9766.12 --> 9770.720000000001
out of nothing that's kind of a

9768.52 --> 9773.6
ridiculous statement there Z tappy

9770.72 --> 9775.679999999998
nobody's claiming beings transported

9773.6 --> 9779.24
into

9775.68 --> 9779.24
existence they were

9780.76 --> 9787.24
designed yeah nobody teleported into

9784.2 --> 9791.16
existence out of nothing they were

9787.24 --> 9794.08
designed yeah life biological physical

9791.16 --> 9797.24
life was designed by

9794.08 --> 9801.12
something that something was probably

9797.24 --> 9801.119999999999
not physical in any way

9805.92 --> 9809.68
right God

9810.479 --> 9816.56
arrived shaped physical

9814.56 --> 9820.08
world

9816.56 --> 9822.24
using the Shapers because the real God

9820.08 --> 9826.72
is not part of the physical world in any

9822.24 --> 9831.359
way so he would have sent arguably his

9826.72 --> 9834.76
sons his Miss jeans his

9831.359 --> 9837.08
design executors the ones that actually

9834.76 --> 9841.92
do the shaping the Shapers and the

9837.08 --> 9845.08
Shapers then proceeded to do the

9841.92 --> 9847.6
design and made life and everything

9845.08 --> 9851.319
shaped it the way it was and that's how

9847.6 --> 9851.319
we come into being

9872.8 --> 9879.84
why do I think there was Giants knocking

9877.16 --> 9882.96
around CU there's lots of stories of

9879.84 --> 9884.279
giants like entire pieces of history

9882.96 --> 9886.479
that involve

9884.279 --> 9890.84
Giants

9886.479 --> 9890.84
and it's logical

9892.72 --> 9898.199999999999
right Giants are a logical consequence

9896.72 --> 9901.8
of

9898.2 --> 9905.68
entropy that humans were giants that

9901.8 --> 9907.92
life was bigger circumstances were purer

9905.68 --> 9910.880000000001
more energy more

9907.92 --> 9914.88
oxygen bigger trees

9910.88 --> 9914.88
bigger nonplant

9915.12 --> 9922.52
life it's that entropy basically made it

9919.399 --> 9927.68
old decrease over

9922.52 --> 9929.960000000001
time right so Giants I mean they're from

9927.68 --> 9932.6
our perspective right now we would

9929.96 --> 9935.0
consider that Giants from their

9932.6 --> 9937.84
perspective we would just be like

9935.0 --> 9940.279
miniature

9937.84 --> 9943.08
humans that's how they would see the

9940.279 --> 9946.12
future it's like wow there all this like

9943.08 --> 9949.479
everybody's like really small children

9946.12 --> 9951.92
like why did we all become dwarves

9949.479 --> 9951.92
that's just

9953.0 --> 9957.359
weird unless they completely understood

9955.479 --> 9960.319
it and it's like yeah entropy I mean

9957.359 --> 9963.319
over time we're going to grow

9960.319 --> 9965.76
smaller and live

9963.319 --> 9968.84
shorter and the environment is going to

9965.76 --> 9971.960000000001
be less accommodating to

9968.84 --> 9974.04
Giants and that's why we will be smaller

9971.96 --> 9977.039999999999
that's why we will be redesigned to be

9974.04 --> 9977.04
smaller

9989.479 --> 9994.56
so at some point there was an empty

9992.24 --> 9996.0
Earth and then animals just appeared

9994.56 --> 9998.278999999999
yeah no they were

9996.0 --> 10001.04
shaped they were

9998.279 --> 10004.800000000001
designed

10001.04 --> 10007.439
shaped matter

10004.8 --> 10009.119999999999
rearranged infused with the spark of

10007.439 --> 10014.12
life

10009.12 --> 10014.12
redesigned and then it just

10014.56 --> 10026.278999999999
formed like a singular cell in a Petri

10020.12 --> 10030.800000000001
dish being grown into a fullblown animal

10026.279 --> 10030.800000000001
yeah just like that

10041.359 --> 10045.84
there's proof we're taller and living

10043.56 --> 10049.56
longer no there is not proof we are

10045.84 --> 10049.56
taller and living longer at

10050.359 --> 10056.279
all

10053.12 --> 10056.279
yeah at

10056.6 --> 10063.359
all it's just claimed that we were

10060.88 --> 10066.358999999999
smaller there's no evidence that we were

10063.359 --> 10066.359
smaller

10069.8 --> 10075.479
yeah that all that stuff is from recent

10073.0 --> 10079.6
history all has to

10075.479 --> 10083.119999999999
do with

10079.6 --> 10087.359
nutrition and toxic

10083.12 --> 10089.960000000001
circumstances yeah you're perpetually

10087.359 --> 10092.2
deprived from having proper food and

10089.96 --> 10094.358999999999
nutrition yeah you're not going to grow

10092.2 --> 10095.92
as tall you're going to get health

10094.359 --> 10099.279
problems live very

10095.92 --> 10103.6
short probably going to die while giving

10099.279 --> 10107.640000000001
birth to offspring yeah that's what that

10103.6 --> 10107.640000000001
has to do with

10107.84 --> 10112.2
yeah we are not living in those

10110.24 --> 10116.439
circumstances where we are continually

10112.2 --> 10120.04
deprived from food and

10116.439 --> 10125.16
nutrition and so we don't live very

10120.04 --> 10129.479000000001
short and we don't stay

10125.16 --> 10132.479
small yeah has nothing to do

10129.479 --> 10135.039999999999
with we are growing naturally taller

10132.479 --> 10136.92
because of evolution

10135.04 --> 10141.04
[Â __Â ]

10136.92 --> 10141.04
yeah it's a nonsense

10157.72 --> 10160.72
Theory

10187.64 --> 10191.68
for for

10236.16 --> 10241.68
so I'm going to

10238.56 --> 10242.439
adapt Title One Last Time and include

10241.68 --> 10245.08
this

10242.439 --> 10247.880000000001
conversation cuz I mean theyve had a

10245.08 --> 10249.8
long talk about Evolution and how it's

10247.88 --> 10252.519999999999
absolute hor [Â __Â ] that's worth

10249.8 --> 10252.519999999999
mentioning in the

10271.56 --> 10275.8
title but you would have to show

10274.04 --> 10279.2
evidence of giant there is evidence of

10275.8 --> 10282.16
giants there's Graves of giants

10279.2 --> 10284.12
all over the

10282.16 --> 10287.399
place on

10284.12 --> 10293.319000000001
record Smithsonian destroying the

10287.399 --> 10293.319
evidence of the on record finding of

10293.52 --> 10300.12
giants yeah so there's no evidence yeah

10297.439 --> 10302.64
there is it's all over the [Â __Â ] place

10300.12 --> 10305.76
there's videos about it all over the

10302.64 --> 10309.56
[Â __Â ] place you're being willingly

10305.76 --> 10309.56
ignorant about it

10324.1 --> 10327.579
[Music]

10333.68 --> 10340.08
CH one real

10335.84 --> 10340.08
video [Â __Â ] yourself

10363.64 --> 10369.64
bro fiber outs why the [Â __Â ] are you

10366.2 --> 10369.640000000001
saying that

10370.64 --> 10374.239
why why are you bringing that

10380.12 --> 10387.640000000001
up you know I can't talk about that at

10383.88 --> 10392.759999999998
all like ever again on my show ever

10387.64 --> 10397.16
again yeah on a daily basis on a daily

10392.76 --> 10401.880000000001
basis videos of mine are getting removed

10397.16 --> 10405.479
because of mention that on a daily basis

10401.88 --> 10408.399
don't bring it up ever

10405.479 --> 10411.679999999998
again yeah you want to talk about it in

10408.399 --> 10417.0
private on Skype or whatever that's

10411.68 --> 10417.0
cool don't bring it up in my chat

10432.12 --> 10439.640000000001
yeah because it will get the video

10436.56 --> 10442.399
removed that's what will

10439.64 --> 10446.08
happen

10442.399 --> 10449.599999999999
yeah the furthest extent that you can

10446.08 --> 10451.16
reference anything in that direction is

10449.6 --> 10453.92
medical

10451.16 --> 10456.68
experiments that's the furthest

10453.92 --> 10458.84
reference that you can give

10456.68 --> 10462.359
here nothing more

10458.84 --> 10462.359
no more detail

10497.2 --> 10500.08
no carrots got

10502.0 --> 10509.96
banned yeah now I had like two or

10506.439 --> 10514.76
whatever and

10509.96 --> 10514.759999999998
uh I survived that

10521.359 --> 10529.16
nothing happening about that yeah clutch

10523.68 --> 10531.479000000001
but afterward though afterward yeah and

10529.16 --> 10534.68
hey you can talk

10531.479 --> 10537.278999999999
positive that you believe in the medic

10534.68 --> 10540.16
oh you need that oh you need to have

10537.279 --> 10543.319000000001
those procedures yeah you can talk about

10540.16 --> 10547.08
that on YouTube if you're a total

10543.319 --> 10550.039999999999
medical industrial complex

10547.08 --> 10553.84
shill yeah you can do that on

10550.04 --> 10556.399000000001
YouTube but if I mention these things

10553.84 --> 10559.880000000001
and if I'm like skeptical in any way if

10556.399 --> 10562.56
I don't like per

10559.88 --> 10567.358999999999
default name those names and then put it

10562.56 --> 10571.519999999999
in a positive daylight then

10567.359 --> 10576.439
afterward the video will be

10571.52 --> 10579.0
removed I've had like 30 to 40 videos of

10576.439 --> 10583.399
mine removed that I did

10579.0 --> 10585.399
three and four years ago yeah still

10583.399 --> 10588.68
keeps

10585.399 --> 10591.358999999999
happening still keeps happening I don't

10588.68 --> 10595.08
have a choice if if you want my videos

10591.359 --> 10599.92
to be around here on YouTube then we

10595.08 --> 10602.2
just can't talk about it just can't talk

10599.92 --> 10602.2
about

10602.68 --> 10614.52
it yeah it's like just blatantly in the

10608.239 --> 10614.52
in the YouTube uh Community rules now

10625.72 --> 10634.278999999999
so yeah and hey yeah what whatever man I

10630.8 --> 10634.278999999999
can't do it

10638.479 --> 10643.199999999999
I'm sure it's double standards right I

10640.92 --> 10646.04
mean I'm sure that if you're not a flat

10643.2 --> 10648.319000000001
Earth or if you're a globe [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ]

10646.04 --> 10651.800000000001
then you could probably talk negatively

10648.319 --> 10654.0
about it but you can't be a flat earther

10651.8 --> 10656.759999999998
and then talk negatively about it as

10654.0 --> 10659.84
well it's something like that I mean

10656.76 --> 10662.399
YouTube's kind of like nasty like that

10659.84 --> 10665.399
how they do these

10662.399 --> 10665.399
things

10666.56 --> 10671.56
right point is there's no point there's

10669.279 --> 10673.560000000001
no point in talking about it if you

10671.56 --> 10675.76
participate in medical

10673.56 --> 10679.0
experimentation you're putting yourself

10675.76 --> 10682.6
on the death list on the slow

10679.0 --> 10682.6
extermination list on the

10682.88 --> 10688.0
Eugenics and of humanity list and like

10686.2 --> 10691.04
yeah I mean at this point if you're

10688.0 --> 10694.04
still partaking in that

10691.04 --> 10694.04
like

10694.439 --> 10702.12
bu like I don't see any point in in

10697.8 --> 10702.119999999999
trying to save you from

10709.08 --> 10716.64
that I mean the amount of

10713.319 --> 10718.68
evidence of medical experimentation

10716.64 --> 10722.439
being harmful for you

10718.68 --> 10724.76
is like on record it's like already on

10722.439 --> 10726.12
record Through official sources like off

10724.76 --> 10728.960000000001
the

10726.12 --> 10730.640000000001
charts right it's just that I still

10728.96 --> 10732.119999999999
can't talk about it officially on

10730.64 --> 10734.519999999999
YouTube without

10732.12 --> 10737.720000000001
risking damage to my Channel or the

10734.52 --> 10739.479000000001
video being removed so I'm like just not

10737.72 --> 10743.8
going to do

10739.479 --> 10746.76
that and like why would I information

10743.8 --> 10751.119999999999
about it is getting shoved in your face

10746.76 --> 10754.72
from all sides every goddamn day for for

10751.12 --> 10757.640000000001
years now so why the hell would I need

10754.72 --> 10759.08
to mention that when it's all over the

10757.64 --> 10761.8
place

10759.08 --> 10763.56
it's no point why would I risk damaging

10761.8 --> 10767.92
my channel like

10763.56 --> 10770.88
that yeah I mean 3 4 years ago when it

10767.92 --> 10772.16
was acute when it was right there right

10770.88 --> 10775.16
then

10772.16 --> 10777.76
happening medical related

10775.16 --> 10780.2
issues that's when it was important to

10777.76 --> 10781.92
basically talk about it a lot because it

10780.2 --> 10784.880000000001
was on everybody's

10781.92 --> 10785.92
mind and I had to warn them I had to

10784.88 --> 10788.119999999999
make

10785.92 --> 10790.92
predictions cuz people were getting

10788.12 --> 10793.720000000001
caught up in it people were being fooled

10790.92 --> 10793.72
by the medical

10795.439 --> 10800.399
experiments but yeah most of those

10798.0 --> 10803.16
videos are now

10800.399 --> 10805.96
removed didn't remove it at the time

10803.16 --> 10808.0
they're removing them

10805.96 --> 10811.519999999999
now because

10808.0 --> 10814.439
YouTube is just tighten its policy you

10811.52 --> 10816.319000000001
just can't say anything negative about

10814.439 --> 10818.359
medical experiments anymore you just

10816.319 --> 10821.16
can't

10818.359 --> 10823.640000000001
they have they hold the right to just

10821.16 --> 10825.92
remove your entire content if you if you

10823.64 --> 10825.92
do

10829.64 --> 10835.278999999999
that yeah it's the big downside of

10832.359 --> 10838.399000000001
YouTube I mean if you want that sort of

10835.279 --> 10840.560000000001
stuff well just go to rumble I mean they

10838.399 --> 10845.399
don't seem to have any problem

10840.56 --> 10849.278999999999
whatsoever talking in like the finest

10845.399 --> 10851.199999999999
detail and super critical about it over

10849.279 --> 10853.76
there I mean they're perfectly fine with

10851.2 --> 10857.68
that so it's like oh okay go to rumble

10853.76 --> 10860.479
then it's filled with videos about that

10857.68 --> 10864.359
just never ending whining about it about

10860.479 --> 10864.358999999999
things that we already know for years

10865.52 --> 10871.279
now the information about it is just

10868.439 --> 10871.279
saturated

10872.0 --> 10879.12
everything like it's getting

10875.64 --> 10883.08
tedious I'm much more interested in see

10879.12 --> 10885.6
seeing some actual results of the

10883.08 --> 10886.68
parties involved that are responsible

10885.6 --> 10890.2
for

10886.68 --> 10893.08
committing it yeah the medical

10890.2 --> 10895.359
experimentations I'd love to see some

10893.08 --> 10899.039999999999
very serious consequences for those

10895.359 --> 10899.04
people that's what I'm waiting

10902.239 --> 10908.96
for yeah I don't really care about all

10905.08 --> 10911.0
supposed damage it's like yeah

10908.96 --> 10913.039999999999
yeah hey you do medical experience yeah

10911.0 --> 10915.359
you get damage

10913.04 --> 10919.960000000001
yeah I mean

10915.359 --> 10922.960000000001
duh what else did you expect you dumb

10919.96 --> 10922.96
asses

10928.88 --> 10935.399
right but

10932.12 --> 10937.6
uh yeah all that stuff is still rolling

10935.399 --> 10940.039999999999
and who knows man I I think I think

10937.6 --> 10943.52
they're all going to get away with it

10940.04 --> 10946.92
cuz everybody's just oh oh we're we're

10943.52 --> 10949.52
good as long as we can complain about it

10946.92 --> 10953.56
and then nothing happens no no

10949.52 --> 10955.84
consequences no no

10953.56 --> 10959.039999999999
arrests no death

10955.84 --> 10962.16
penalties despite the nerber code being

10959.04 --> 10964.319000000001
blatantly violated Way Beyond what has

10962.16 --> 10967.08
ever happened before in

10964.319 --> 10968.439
history and so I think they're going to

10967.08 --> 10971.72
get away with it

10968.439 --> 10975.16
completely get away with it and they're

10971.72 --> 10977.519999999999
going to keep flaunting it in our face

10975.16 --> 10980.84
till the end of their days which is

10977.52 --> 10984.84
going to be very longlasting

10980.84 --> 10986.72
life like Generations after people that

10984.84 --> 10990.960000000001
have participated in medical experiments

10986.72 --> 10994.358999999999
have all died out yeah cuz nobody's

10990.96 --> 10997.239
going to do anything yeah nothing just

10994.359 --> 10998.640000000001
nothing just flaunting it in everybody's

10997.239 --> 11001.6
face

10998.64 --> 11004.519999999999
that Humanity like your freedom is gone

11001.6 --> 11006.239
the truth is gone Satan is winning

11004.52 --> 11008.960000000001
nobody's going to [Â __Â ] do anything

11006.239 --> 11013.08
about it and everybody just go [Â __Â ]

11008.96 --> 11013.08
yourselves yeah that's this world

11013.239 --> 11019.92
now yeah they've taken over and they're

11017.88 --> 11023.358999999999
flaunting it and they will keep

11019.92 --> 11025.8
flaunting it and they will never stop

11023.359 --> 11028.52
and nobody's going to do anything about

11025.8 --> 11031.039999999999
it just nothing

11028.52 --> 11032.960000000001
just more harping on and oh telling

11031.04 --> 11036.479000000001
everybody how it is yeah we know how it

11032.96 --> 11038.56
is yeah and nobody's going to change

11036.479 --> 11041.84
anything

11038.56 --> 11045.359
so they can all go [Â __Â ] themselves as

11041.84 --> 11045.359
far as I'm concerned

11060.8 --> 11066.199999999999
right so I'm

11063.2 --> 11068.68
really very skeptical that anything is

11066.2 --> 11070.16
going to actually happen to punish the

11068.68 --> 11072.239
guilty

11070.16 --> 11076.52
parties I don't think I think they're

11072.239 --> 11079.399
going to get completely away with it

11076.52 --> 11083.279
forever and that a majority of people on

11079.399 --> 11085.358999999999
Earth will be exterminated because of it

11083.279 --> 11087.0
and nobody everybody will know that

11085.359 --> 11088.52
that's what happened and that is what is

11087.0 --> 11091.0
happening and no nobody's going to do

11088.52 --> 11094.279
anything about it it's just everybody's

11091.0 --> 11096.84
just going to slowly die because of it

11094.279 --> 11099.16
while the perpetrators keep flaunting it

11096.84 --> 11101.439
in our face what they've done the rest

11099.16 --> 11103.76
of their lives that's what I think is

11101.439 --> 11103.76
going to

11112.68 --> 11119.64
happen yeah zeppy you can leave it out

11116.2 --> 11119.640000000001
of there huh

11141.6 --> 11148.720000000001
right I mean the involved parties like

11144.64 --> 11151.88
upon identification should be swarmed by

11148.72 --> 11155.278999999999
people with knives that literally rip

11151.88 --> 11157.92
them apart like sever all their limbs

11155.279 --> 11160.68
and rip all their organs out upon

11157.92 --> 11163.16
spotting them one time that's what

11160.68 --> 11168.2
should be happening but people won't do

11163.16 --> 11169.92
it I'll just gladly sit around be aware

11168.2 --> 11171.2
that it's happened and let everything

11169.92 --> 11174.960000000001
just

11171.2 --> 11174.960000000001
die miserable

11175.8 --> 11180.679999999998
cowardice yeah maybe you lucky Z tappy

11178.52 --> 11180.68
who

11204.88 --> 11210.759999999998
knows just could you please not get

11221.72 --> 11226.399
specific all Lucky no

11243.76 --> 11247.68
right anyhow I'm going to run out the

11247.72 --> 11253.479
show it's an

11250.52 --> 11254.720000000001
interesting at least in the last part

11253.479 --> 11257.399
something

11254.72 --> 11258.239
happened me the first hour was pretty

11257.399 --> 11260.92
much

11258.239 --> 11263.6
intolerable I'm still pissed

11260.92 --> 11266.08
off genuinely like I'm not going to

11263.6 --> 11270.6
forget that that

11266.08 --> 11270.6
happened I'm genuinely pissed

11273.439 --> 11280.279
off that keeps happening I am going to

11276.439 --> 11283.12
end the early bir show cuz that was

11280.279 --> 11283.12
absolutely

11293.76 --> 11299.56
intolerable all right but hey the rest

11296.399 --> 11302.56
of the show that was kind of cool what

11299.56 --> 11308.278999999999
happened absolutely nothing happened

11302.56 --> 11313.64
Moxy nobody said anything nobody showed

11308.279 --> 11317.52
up just left me there in just

11313.64 --> 11317.519999999999
silence for like an

11318.319 --> 11324.88
hour when I was full of energy ready to

11322.08 --> 11327.68
talk about subjects ready to bring like

11324.88 --> 11329.479
to answer questions about the subject

11327.68 --> 11332.279
from yesterday that I'm all filled up

11329.479 --> 11335.84
with referencing new videos I was all

11332.279 --> 11337.560000000001
ready and literally nobody [Â __Â ]

11335.84 --> 11344.16
showed up for an

11337.56 --> 11344.16
hour yeah absolutely insufferable

11357.52 --> 11361.76
yeah everybody oh you were there as soon

11359.399 --> 11364.199999999999
as you could yeah well I guess nobody

11361.76 --> 11369.319
could show up cuz everybody was just

11364.2 --> 11372.16
sleeping over and being lame and

11369.319 --> 11373.64
toasty and just not having anything to

11372.16 --> 11378.16
say

11373.64 --> 11381.72
today for some reason maybe because it's

11378.16 --> 11383.76
Mayday maybe everybody turns into a lazy

11381.72 --> 11386.84
[Â __Â ] zombie in Mayday and maybe

11383.76 --> 11391.12
that's why why this happened I just know

11386.84 --> 11393.880000000001
that I was quite agitated over

11391.12 --> 11397.560000000001
it and I almost rounded out the show

11393.88 --> 11397.56
like 2 hours ago because of

11399.359 --> 11402.359
it

11408.52 --> 11412.84
so yeah so let's make sure that it

11411.399 --> 11415.56
doesn't happen

11412.84 --> 11418.04
tomorrow if that keeps happening a few

11415.56 --> 11422.119999999999
more times then I'm going to discontinue

11418.04 --> 11426.479000000001
the Flat Earth early bird show yeah it's

11422.12 --> 11430.12
like I'm not here to sit there for an

11426.479 --> 11432.96
hour with no freaking Communications

11430.12 --> 11436.359
whatsoever just so you could all show up

11432.96 --> 11438.479
late and then like oh oh why are you so

11436.359 --> 11442.0
pissed off

11438.479 --> 11442.0
yeah why do you

11445.96 --> 11450.839999999998
think yeah

11447.88 --> 11456.92
you want you want my show you you like

11450.84 --> 11456.92
this show well don't show up in the last

11465.56 --> 11470.88
hour and I don't even understand why I

11468.12 --> 11474.08
mean yesterday everybody was there right

11470.88 --> 11478.119999999999
from the start that's exactly how I

11474.08 --> 11479.64
wanted that's exactly what I need

11478.12 --> 11481.68
people being in there right from the

11479.64 --> 11483.92
start and then it's fluid then it's go

11481.68 --> 11486.6
time and then it's excellent then we

11483.92 --> 11489.960000000001
have a great show and have good feelings

11486.6 --> 11492.76
good moral good questions good

11489.96 --> 11495.839999999998
ideas yeah that's what happens then if

11492.76 --> 11500.04
everybody just shows up super [Â __Â ]

11495.84 --> 11500.04
late then it ruins

11506.0 --> 11511.2
everything yeah

11508.279 --> 11513.640000000001
oh and well maybe it's unreasonable to

11511.2 --> 11516.880000000001
get angry with people for not showing up

11513.64 --> 11521.16
I'm just telling you it ruins the

11516.88 --> 11525.599999999999
show it does it provably

11521.16 --> 11528.76
does right so hey I'll try not to get

11525.6 --> 11532.399000000001
mad sure it's better if I just don't get

11528.76 --> 11533.399
mad but it does ruin the show and that's

11532.399 --> 11537.399
a

11533.399 --> 11537.399
fact right

11543.56 --> 11545.8
that's

11546.239 --> 11552.8
all right and hey if if you couldn't

11549.6 --> 11555.359
well that's just more logical reason

11552.8 --> 11557.72
then for me to not do the show anymore

11555.359 --> 11561.2
if nobody can actually be there for

11557.72 --> 11565.599999999999
whatever good reason they have well then

11561.2 --> 11565.6
maybe I shouldn't be there

11567.359 --> 11571.76
why would I do the show if nobody can be

11569.92 --> 11574.76
there for a good

11571.76 --> 11574.76
reason

11579.08 --> 11584.64
yeah oh try to survive my hate for a d

11581.96 --> 11587.319
that doesn't sound

11584.64 --> 11589.039999999999
good show starts 30 minutes before your

11587.319 --> 11593.16
shows

11589.04 --> 11593.160000000002
okay a fair enough fiber

11594.52 --> 11600.800000000001
outs but I mean maybe I will just end

11598.76 --> 11604.479
end it I mean I'm not even saying like

11600.8 --> 11607.319
how dare you guys you are destroying my

11604.479 --> 11610.199999999999
show I'm just saying like this is not

11607.319 --> 11613.239
working it's a a neutral observation

11610.2 --> 11613.239000000001
it's not working like

11620.279 --> 11624.6
this that is all

11630.08 --> 11634.6
at the beginning of my week days all

11632.08 --> 11634.6
right fair

11645.68 --> 11650.439
enough all right but I'm I'm glad that

11648.2 --> 11653.04
you guys are around right

11650.439 --> 11657.800000000001
now okay B call don't

11653.04 --> 11660.399000000001
know yeah I do know

11657.8 --> 11664.399
Moxy I did know it was discussed that

11660.399 --> 11666.76
it's a bank holiday and that gave me

11664.399 --> 11667.68
extra reason to assume that everybody's

11666.76 --> 11671.0
just

11667.68 --> 11673.64
toasty everybody's just having a lazy

11671.0 --> 11675.72
day and I hate lazy I hate it it when

11673.64 --> 11677.88
that

11675.72 --> 11679.479
happens I don't like it when that

11677.88 --> 11682.72
happens at

11679.479 --> 11684.399
all so hopefully it will not be like

11682.72 --> 11686.64
that

11684.399 --> 11689.039999999999
tomorrow people will be there a little

11686.64 --> 11689.039999999999
bit quick

11693.279 --> 11700.52
ER my show is not at the same time as

11696.12 --> 11702.92
fed my show is an hour earlier than fed

11700.52 --> 11702.92
zap

11705.2 --> 11712.12
tappy most of my people I don't know

11708.439 --> 11712.12
what my people you're talking

11714.84 --> 11721.319
about a lot of people that go to FB they

11718.319 --> 11725.039999999999
don't show up here at

11721.319 --> 11727.439
all actually the only one that I even

11725.04 --> 11730.199
recognize that goes there and still

11727.439 --> 11732.439
shows up here sometimes is Richard G and

11730.199 --> 11732.439
that's

11734.199 --> 11740.0
it there's an overlap yeah so [Â __Â ]

11737.84 --> 11746.279
what said

11740.0 --> 11746.279
happy so [Â __Â ] what

11750.6 --> 11755.68
yeah I get my most

11753.439 --> 11758.52
interaction with the

11755.68 --> 11760.68
check when fed

11758.52 --> 11765.359
started

11760.68 --> 11769.479000000001
yeah that's when I actually get the most

11765.359 --> 11772.12
interaction yeah the hour before that's

11769.479 --> 11775.319
when everybody just shuts the [Â __Â ] up

11772.12 --> 11775.319000000001
and is lazy as

11775.52 --> 11781.04
[Â __Â ] so your reasoning is completely

11778.56 --> 11783.0
wrong it's like oh it's overlapping

11781.04 --> 11784.279
that's the problem no it's exactly not

11783.0 --> 11787.6
the

11784.279 --> 11790.279
problem if I wanted to prevent any of it

11787.6 --> 11793.16
you know what I'd start 300 p.m.

11790.279 --> 11795.92
Amsterdam time exactly the same time

11793.16 --> 11798.8
slot because then people would just

11795.92 --> 11801.04
immediately get in the chat and active

11798.8 --> 11804.039999999999
you know that's what actually would

11801.04 --> 11804.04
happen

11809.319 --> 11814.56
yeah and not people that want to watch

11811.479 --> 11816.358999999999
Fed for some reason everybody [Â __Â ]

11814.56 --> 11817.278999999999
wakes up around that time and they all

11816.359 --> 11820.279
get

11817.279 --> 11822.880000000001
active and not because they're watching

11820.279 --> 11827.239
fed a lot of people here don't want to

11822.88 --> 11827.239
watch Fed I don't want to watch

11832.8 --> 11837.289999999999
Fed so it's nonsense it's not an

11835.72 --> 11840.378999999999
argument

11837.29 --> 11840.379
[Music]

11850.279 --> 11854.640000000001
having gotten those argum yeah no the

11851.92 --> 11856.6
argumentation is great fiber outs I mean

11854.64 --> 11859.0
I've learned from the arguments I

11856.6 --> 11862.76
utilize them in as best as I

11859.0 --> 11862.76
can and then I move

11863.72 --> 11871.479
on yeah I I don't want to be a

11867.8 --> 11873.438999999998
like a robot just just like oh sorry no

11871.479 --> 11875.278999999999
the only thing that I can talk about is

11873.439 --> 11878.359
those arguments yeah

11875.279 --> 11881.08
no forget about that I got better things

11878.359 --> 11881.08
to do with my

11884.72 --> 11891.599999999999
life what not true it's I don't know

11888.479 --> 11891.599999999999
where the hell you're getting

11891.76 --> 11896.08
that it's nonsense

11913.56 --> 11919.76
toxicity yeah well that's why I don't

11915.88 --> 11923.56
watch it anymore because that toxicity

11919.76 --> 11923.56
made me

11923.6 --> 11929.92
ill like very seriously to the point

11927.239 --> 11932.52
where I got a lot of anger issues

11929.92 --> 11936.04
partially Amplified because of

11932.52 --> 11936.04
that and

11938.16 --> 11943.479
depression and just having continual

11941.12 --> 11945.640000000001
frustration that I couldn't properly

11943.479 --> 11947.198999999999
talk about the subjects that I wanted to

11945.64 --> 11950.56
bring

11947.199 --> 11954.52
up and that I even was afraid to bring

11950.56 --> 11956.92
up sub such subjects on my own show

11954.52 --> 11962.08
because I would get criticized by the

11956.92 --> 11964.04
guys for it yeah and that's all over now

11962.08 --> 11968.319
yeah I I

11964.04 --> 11971.0
don't let myself be steered like that

11968.319 --> 11973.439
anymore I'm a free man I talk about

11971.0 --> 11977.64
whatever the [Â __Â ] hell I want to talk

11973.439 --> 11979.08
about except if that gets YouTube to

11977.64 --> 11983.92
take my video

11979.08 --> 11985.239
down I try to avoid aggressive subjects

11983.92 --> 11988.960000000001
I try to

11985.239 --> 11991.16
avoid polar IED political level

11988.96 --> 11995.16
judgments on

11991.16 --> 11997.72
groups especially that we deal with and

11995.16 --> 11999.96
I just try to bring out interesting

11997.72 --> 12002.76
conversations and be very informative

11999.96 --> 12004.599999999999
about them and that's what I do now and

12002.76 --> 12006.56
I'm much better at it I'm much more

12004.6 --> 12009.16
stable I'm

12006.56 --> 12011.56
healthier and I'm more willing to do it

12009.16 --> 12015.479
and that's why my shows are

12011.56 --> 12018.359
now the length that they

12015.479 --> 12021.438999999998
are is it's because I have my freedom

12018.359 --> 12023.960000000001
now to just be the way that I want to be

12021.439 --> 12023.960000000001
and be

12037.92 --> 12042.76
effective ah well damn it you didn't get

12040.359 --> 12045.76
that job that sucks fod sorry to hear

12042.76 --> 12045.76
that

12059.88 --> 12062.88
suspicious

12065.52 --> 12071.92
whatever yeah I'm not going to deal with

12067.88 --> 12074.56
that like I only care about the

12071.92 --> 12076.84
argumentations and the social hassle

12074.56 --> 12078.56
that is there I don't want to have any

12076.84 --> 12081.92
to do with that

12078.56 --> 12084.0
whatsoever I'm out yeah that's why I'm

12081.92 --> 12085.64
out that's why I'm out for months and

12084.0 --> 12088.68
I'm going to stay out because I don't

12085.64 --> 12091.08
want to have anything to do with that

12088.68 --> 12093.439
social garbage

12091.08 --> 12098.039999999999
hassle at

12093.439 --> 12100.720000000001
all right but I am very interested in

12098.04 --> 12104.399000000001
the technical arguments and I will

12100.72 --> 12107.519999999999
definitely represent them and maybe even

12104.399 --> 12108.68
fulfill a slight diplomatic role to get

12107.52 --> 12111.880000000001
people

12108.68 --> 12116.479000000001
to understand it a little better

12111.88 --> 12119.239
and avoid taking things personal the

12116.479 --> 12122.08
social hassle right that I'm very

12119.239 --> 12122.08
willing to do

12124.52 --> 12128.640000000001
that but I'm not going to sit in a group

12127.72 --> 12131.599999999999
that

12128.64 --> 12135.278999999999
just treats me the way that they have

12131.6 --> 12137.359
like I'm not doing that anymore

12135.279 --> 12138.960000000001
ever yeah

12137.359 --> 12142.08
there's literally nothing in the [Â __Â ]

12138.96 --> 12147.8
world you could do to make me go back

12142.08 --> 12151.76
there nothing no 500 bucks

12147.8 --> 12151.759999999998
nothing I'm going to do what I

12156.08 --> 12162.479
do a thank you fibos yeah I know it is

12158.88 --> 12167.599999999999
noticeable it is palpable I mean even my

12162.479 --> 12167.599999999999
friend from n is telling me this

12167.92 --> 12172.72
like they're telling me like you're

12169.359 --> 12176.720000000001
different you're different now you're

12172.72 --> 12180.96
more amicable you're more sensible

12176.72 --> 12183.96
sensitive less less academic because

12180.96 --> 12186.919999999998
that academic Spirit was really

12183.96 --> 12191.438999999998
saturated and it made

12186.92 --> 12198.439
me merciless in a certain way that does

12191.439 --> 12198.439
not match my personality my natural born

12199.279 --> 12206.52
personality it was bad for me it was

12201.96 --> 12208.96
destructive for my being's frequency and

12206.52 --> 12211.479000000001
I'm done with that now I understand what

12208.96 --> 12214.039999999999
it is why it is and I don't see the

12211.479 --> 12216.76
point of being part of that

12214.04 --> 12219.52
anymore because it's having a

12216.76 --> 12223.12
counterproductive influence it's not

12219.52 --> 12224.76
resulting in having been having it to

12223.12 --> 12227.239000000001
attain more respect for the

12224.76 --> 12229.84
argumentation it's causing

12227.239 --> 12233.039999999999
more people to be

12229.84 --> 12236.76
rejecting of the entire thing because of

12233.04 --> 12236.76
the feelings that are so

12236.84 --> 12241.960000000001
disregarded

12238.479 --> 12245.72
so and but I am willing to still fulfill

12241.96 --> 12251.679999999998
a a slight intermediary diplomatic

12245.72 --> 12253.519999999999
role but not it's part of the guys no

12251.68 --> 12257.52
that's not happening

12253.52 --> 12257.52
anymore right

12275.479 --> 12280.119999999999
yeah Steven jvis yeah it would have been

12277.68 --> 12284.279
more annoying

12280.12 --> 12287.640000000001
right I mean I'm still not entirely up

12284.279 --> 12290.399000000001
for dealing with Daft

12287.64 --> 12294.278999999999
globers you still annoy the [Â __Â ] out of

12290.399 --> 12296.96
me at times especially when you go full

12294.279 --> 12299.16
Ballard but

12296.96 --> 12305.358999999999
uh in

12299.16 --> 12305.359
general I'm like just less

12306.239 --> 12311.0
harsh I'm willing to give some

12308.68 --> 12313.68
adaptation room cuz I know you're not

12311.0 --> 12316.479
going to grow out of it but you can

12313.68 --> 12319.56
learn to adapt and not burden other

12316.479 --> 12322.76
people with your idiotic beliefs as much

12319.56 --> 12324.64
to not double down on it as much I know

12322.76 --> 12327.359
you're not going to change

12324.64 --> 12329.16
it but at least you can be less of a

12327.359 --> 12332.319
burden on people that still have some

12329.16 --> 12332.319
sensibility left to

12338.08 --> 12342.08
them uh

12362.72 --> 12366.119999999999
oh God I don't even want to know who

12364.479 --> 12369.239
you're talking about right now fiber

12366.12 --> 12369.239000000001
oats but I can

12369.96 --> 12375.64
guess yeah I don't want to deal with

12372.04 --> 12375.640000000001
that ever

12378.12 --> 12382.04
right but I mean there's no management

12380.84 --> 12384.479
there's

12382.04 --> 12387.640000000001
no Nathan is not

12384.479 --> 12391.119999999999
managing he's just not managing it

12387.64 --> 12392.96
properly it's out of control and he's

12391.12 --> 12395.800000000001
leaving it out of control and I try to

12392.96 --> 12398.16
address him on it there used to be a

12395.8 --> 12400.72
time when there was management and then

12398.16 --> 12405.039999999999
he stopped he stopped doing

12400.72 --> 12408.72
that and it's been a gigantic

12405.04 --> 12411.359
mess a depleting mess ever since and I'm

12408.72 --> 12414.56
not going to be part of that

12411.359 --> 12418.08
anymore stopping talking about it

12414.56 --> 12420.519999999999

12486.279 --> 12493.319000000001
be great that we could like get it

12490.16 --> 12495.399
rolling without me just getting in a

12493.319 --> 12497.16
really terrible mood because yeah if

12495.399 --> 12499.88
something gets me in a terrible mood

12497.16 --> 12503.8
it's when the chat's just completely

12499.88 --> 12507.319
depleted and nobody's doing anything is

12503.8 --> 12509.679999999998
a person saying hello and then like

12507.319 --> 12511.08
nothing happens for 40 minutes straight

12509.68 --> 12513.6
like

12511.08 --> 12517.64
that's something gets me in a bad mood

12513.6 --> 12520.92
and that's it that's pretty much it

12517.64 --> 12522.92
right and I need to deal with that

12520.92 --> 12525.56
better as well I I need to be able to

12522.92 --> 12528.199
just like accept like okay well this

this show is now [Â __Â ] because of that

12533.359 --> 12537.279
and there's nothing I can do about it

12535.439 --> 12539.56
best I could do is just not get in a

12537.279 --> 12542.92
really terrible

12539.56 --> 12545.88
mood and just accept like yeah this show

12542.92 --> 12549.8

12545.88 --> 12551.92
that nothing else I can do except damage

12549.8 --> 12553.08
control and I I might need to learn that

12551.92 --> 12554.84
because it's not going to be the last

12553.08 --> 12558.6
time that this is happening I
