and a long night last night

126.32 --> 134.16
lots of stuff it's even up and debating

131.28 --> 135.44
sort of while discussing things even a

134.16 --> 138.48
rectangular looping

135.44 --> 140.84
situation concept

138.48 --> 145.28
very late like three o'clock or

140.84 --> 149.84
something over a 24 7 discord

145.28 --> 152.959
uh and with which it gets it there

149.84 --> 153.44
who turns out to be a bear like he

152.959 --> 155.12
started

153.44 --> 156.72
throwing out certain expressions that

155.12 --> 161.28
were just unmistakable like

156.72 --> 161.28
wait no it's this is that

161.36 --> 165.28
it's like that's gotta be own benjamin

163.36 --> 168.56
and he was so that was pretty cool

165.28 --> 170.08
learning that starting to like this

168.56 --> 173.519
witch it gets it character

170.08 --> 177.68
more and more as time passes

173.519 --> 182.64000000000001
so it's pretty cool uh yeah

177.68 --> 182.64000000000001
the weather today is yeah

182.84 --> 189.36
different it's like this

186.08 --> 192.31900000000002
hazy stuff up there kind of

189.36 --> 193.28
typical light winter clouds and the sun

192.319 --> 197.44
is

193.28 --> 200.56
shining through it but yeah this weird

197.44 --> 200.56
white halo

202.239 --> 208.4
it's not very warm outside

205.76 --> 213.84
but it is at least dry and there's not a

208.4 --> 213.84
lot of wind

222.959 --> 228.0
so funny to see the sunlight shining in

226.0 --> 229.519
my room these days now that i'm starting

228.0 --> 231.44
at one o'clock because that never really

229.519 --> 235.20000000000002
used to happen before

231.44 --> 238.4
but now it does so

235.2 --> 243.11999999999998
anyway it's thursday

238.4 --> 245.28
the 10th december 2020

243.12 --> 246.4
2020 is almost over i can't barely

245.28 --> 250.4
believe it

246.4 --> 254.08
up quick that all went

250.4 --> 258.56
though lots and lots has happened

254.08 --> 258.56
so ah

259.28 --> 263.03999999999996
right yesterday's early bird show was

261.6 --> 265.84000000000003
pretty good i didn't watch it back i

263.04 --> 267.759
don't know man since it's two hours

265.84 --> 269.52
i barely find the time to watch my own

267.759 --> 272.16
shows back anymore it's like the one

269.52 --> 272.15999999999997
downside

272.479 --> 276.32
but yeah i got a couple of compliments

274.56 --> 277.759
and of course troll comments and all

276.32 --> 282.4
that

277.759 --> 283.199
afterward ah flat earth debates was also

282.4 --> 285.35999999999996
pretty good

283.199 --> 287.04
was there throughout most of the show in

285.36 --> 290.08000000000004
the after show

287.04 --> 292.16
did my newspaper rounds was

290.08 --> 293.35999999999996
pretty repulsed by like one of the

292.16 --> 296.96000000000004
titles on

293.36 --> 298.47900000000004
that newspaper that i was spreading

296.96 --> 300.71999999999997
see and it was misleading it was

298.479 --> 303.68
literally fake news because it

300.72 --> 304.40000000000003
was this supposed article talking about

303.68 --> 308.36
the mask

304.4 --> 311.35999999999996
mandate in stores like in

308.36 --> 312.56
non-supermarket stores because there i

311.36 --> 315.91900000000004
haven't really come

312.56 --> 317.68
come across it yet that is some kind

315.919 --> 319.84
yeah that's a mandate

317.68 --> 321.039
at other stores it seems like they made

319.84 --> 323.039
it a mandate

321.039 --> 325.52
and this article said like yeah big

323.039 --> 328.32
masks

325.52 --> 328.32
what is it again

330.639 --> 337.199
like something in the direction of masks

333.919 --> 339.68
providing economic growth or something

337.199 --> 340.639
and like literally i read through the

339.68 --> 342.96
article

340.639 --> 344.72
it's relatively big for that newspaper

342.96 --> 348.08
and there literally was

344.72 --> 350.56
no no evidence to actually provide for

348.08 --> 353.12
the title or even a comment on it at all

350.56 --> 354.639
it was just describing as

353.12 --> 357.12
like yeah they're wearing masks and

354.639 --> 358.24
people that were part of stores were

357.12 --> 360.24
interviewed like yeah

358.24 --> 361.52
it's working fine like it's working like

360.24 --> 365.36
this now

361.52 --> 369.44
and there was literally no kind of like

365.36 --> 372.639
economic benefits explained whatsoever

369.44 --> 375.52
it was just describing the new situation

372.639 --> 376.0
in a support a supposed sort of positive

375.52 --> 378.0
way

376.0 --> 380.8
not negative and that's it but i thought

378.0 --> 382.88
that was so misleading that i actually

380.8 --> 385.919
threw out the entire

382.88 --> 390.4
paper run made me think

385.919 --> 393.59999999999997
maybe i should hand in my resignation

390.4 --> 395.28
but i don't know yet like i'm probably

393.6 --> 397.03900000000004
wait another week see what

395.28 --> 398.79999999999995
what's going to be on the front page the

397.039 --> 400.24
next time and if it's going to be just

398.8 --> 401.68
as bad then i will hand in my

400.24 --> 403.919
recognition because i'm not going to be

401.68 --> 407.52
part of spreading fake news

403.919 --> 410.96
it's disgusting and it's not worth it

407.52 --> 411.68
like i originally set out to do this

410.96 --> 413.68
whole thing

411.68 --> 415.44
the newspaper rounds just for the

413.68 --> 417.84000000000003
benefit of the people that like it but

415.44 --> 420.84
if that means that they're going to be

417.84 --> 423.11999999999995
then extra indoctrinated with complete

420.84 --> 424.79999999999995
nonsense then i don't want to be part of

423.12 --> 428.479
that anymore

424.8 --> 428.479
anyway where is everybody

434.84 --> 441.11999999999995
ah here we go again

437.919 --> 443.84
good morning off sick work sick today

441.12 --> 446.639
try sneezing in a mask

443.84 --> 447.75899999999996
all right that sucks hey you said you

446.639 --> 450.88
had

447.759 --> 452.47900000000004
some issues with work

450.88 --> 453.919
well sorry to hear you're sick i hope

452.479 --> 456.8
you get well better

453.919 --> 458.79999999999995
make sure to get an you know what to do

456.8 --> 462.72
if you don't

458.8 --> 464.72
like one thing i learn

462.72 --> 466.8
people are sick don't start throwing

464.72 --> 468.24
advice at them it can be very annoying

466.8 --> 471.599
because they'll probably know

468.24 --> 474.319
what to do anyway they want some tips

471.599 --> 476.08
and wait until they ask so yeah if you

474.319 --> 479.84000000000003
do want some tips about that

476.08 --> 479.84
ask but i trust you know

482.0 --> 486.0
anyway get well better soon here we go

483.759 --> 486.0
again

487.84 --> 492.08
i work with the public and i have to

489.52 --> 492.08
wear a mask

498.72 --> 504.639
anyway getting a cold is usually it's

501.44 --> 507.44
pretty good it just means that your body

504.639 --> 509.759
has gone to that point of like okay it's

507.44 --> 511.759
time to clean this up

509.759 --> 513.279
that's really what how i see it and then

511.759 --> 515.6800000000001
when you get through it you always

513.279 --> 516.479
feel better than you did before you got

515.68 --> 518.3199999999999
sick

516.479 --> 519.519
every time that's with me and at least i

518.32 --> 522.8000000000001
hope it's going to be with you

519.519 --> 525.2
as well so it's like that made

522.8 --> 527.1999999999999
getting sick something to look forward

525.2 --> 528.8000000000001
to once you get sick it's like

527.2 --> 530.48
when i get better i'm going to feel a

528.8 --> 532.0799999999999
lot better

530.48 --> 533.519
and that's like something nice to look

532.08 --> 537.44
forward to so maybe

533.519 --> 542.32
that's that's one tip i'm giving you

537.44 --> 544.32
all right anyway uh

542.32 --> 546.72
yeah besides flatter's debate also

544.32 --> 550.8000000000001
watched mark sergeant

546.72 --> 553.6800000000001
s w 280 most of it

550.8 --> 555.8389999999999
karen b and just general talk mask talk

553.68 --> 558.959
and it is interesting it is interesting

555.839 --> 561.2
mark does have like yeah

558.959 --> 562.16
it shows every time like he does really

561.2 --> 565.519
research

562.16 --> 567.36
a lot of like these societal things

565.519 --> 568.88
like really looks up statistics and

567.36 --> 572.08
stuff i don't do that

568.88 --> 573.92
with me it's all just intuition

572.08 --> 575.519
and reflecting upon everything that i

573.92 --> 577.76
see and then

575.519 --> 579.68
intuitively making an average judgment

577.76 --> 581.12
that's how i do things because i i'm not

579.68 --> 584.3199999999999
a statistics guy

581.12 --> 586.88
i get statistics i know how they work

584.32 --> 588.6400000000001
but i'm not like digging into it all the

586.88 --> 590.08
time

588.64 --> 591.92
kind of like to leave that to other

590.08 --> 594.08
people and then reflect up

591.92 --> 595.04
of them but it was interesting and he

594.08 --> 596.5600000000001
also yeah

595.04 --> 598.56
i'm sorry it does have some weird

596.56 --> 601.3599999999999
opinions here and there and

598.56 --> 602.3199999999999
weird sense of humor kind of over the

601.36 --> 605.44
top

602.32 --> 606.8000000000001
but it's still interesting to listen to

605.44 --> 611.44
his opinion

606.8 --> 613.279
on things uh right also um benjamin went

611.44 --> 614.8000000000001
live again was there the whole

613.279 --> 616.88
wait no was that there the whole thing

614.8 --> 619.8389999999999
no i think i noticed it

616.88 --> 622.48
halfway i missed a notification it was a

619.839 --> 624.399
pretty good show

622.48 --> 625.6800000000001
i i don't remember again what was it

624.399 --> 626.16
again oh yeah there was a new mountain

625.68 --> 628.959
bear

626.16 --> 628.959
cartoon i think

629.6 --> 636.64
with oh yeah with with trump

633.44 --> 638.9590000000001
the like the orange man bear

636.64 --> 639.92
as i've called that specific character

638.959 --> 642.959
it's like

639.92 --> 645.04
owen benjamin's trump

642.959 --> 646.16
being gay and just wanting to jack

645.04 --> 648.7199999999999
everybody off

646.16 --> 650.16
to relieve them of the stress basically

648.72 --> 651.839
that character that he's created is

650.16 --> 655.12
hilarious to me

651.839 --> 656.24
it's like the left wish they could have

655.12 --> 658.9590000000001
such a logos

656.24 --> 660.72
joke about the guy they've been trying

658.959 --> 663.04
for a long time and just being

660.72 --> 664.8000000000001
annoying i thought anything owen

663.04 --> 665.519
benjamin's version is just freaking

664.8 --> 670.24
hilarious

665.519 --> 670.24
and kind of on target in ways

670.399 --> 674.399
and mountain bear made a cartoon of that

672.399 --> 678.0
it was pretty hilarious

674.399 --> 680.64
like a maga guy that was just

678.0 --> 681.76
being a total dumbass as they are

680.64 --> 686.399
sometimes not

681.76 --> 689.6
not saying no hey i like again

686.399 --> 692.399
i kind of am on their side so don't

689.6 --> 694.16
yeah i'm not a not an anti-trump or a

692.399 --> 697.12
long shot

694.16 --> 698.079
but i will always have legitimate

697.12 --> 701.2
criticism

698.079 --> 704.4799999999999
where legitimate criticism is due

701.2 --> 708.0790000000001
right so yeah and after that

704.48 --> 710.72
uh yeah 24 7 discord

708.079 --> 712.56
it was there pretty long time which it

710.72 --> 714.8000000000001
gets it was there

712.56 --> 717.1999999999999
qe was there chocolate sane at some

714.8 --> 718.8
point was there and there were

717.2 --> 720.399
there was this though it was a very

718.8 --> 721.4399999999999
interesting situation there was this new

720.399 --> 724.8
guy

721.44 --> 726.72
coming in and he's like that that was

724.8 --> 728.8
like the first time he clicked on flat

726.72 --> 731.44
earth or something

728.8 --> 733.4399999999999
and it was like yeah when that happens

731.44 --> 735.839
you really i recognize like it's like

733.44 --> 737.839
this weird wobbly special energy

735.839 --> 739.44
that they carry where they're like

737.839 --> 742.5600000000001
completely neutral

739.44 --> 743.44
but still have like the the old

742.56 --> 745.1199999999999
conditionings

743.44 --> 747.44
coming up for the first time and all

745.12 --> 750.639
that and

747.44 --> 752.8000000000001
yeah all of us with it

750.639 --> 753.839
and me too at some point we're basically

752.8 --> 756.24
explaining

753.839 --> 759.12
the baseline arguments from the flat

756.24 --> 760.9590000000001
earth side as to why it's not a globe

759.12 --> 763.2
the second law of thermodynamics gas

760.959 --> 766.88
pressure expansion

763.2 --> 769.519
no curvature black swan but yeah

766.88 --> 771.4399999999999
those two mostly the most important

769.519 --> 773.92
arguments the black swan

771.44 --> 775.44
no curvature and the gas pressure

773.92 --> 776.4799999999999
without a container and and we

775.44 --> 779.0400000000001
elaborated

776.48 --> 780.8000000000001
on that extensively and i even tried to

779.04 --> 781.519
explain something about refraction how

780.8 --> 782.959
it works

781.519 --> 784.9590000000001
because it was the first time he was

782.959 --> 787.04
hearing this everybody was kind of

784.959 --> 788.6389999999999
getting a little impatient with him i

787.04 --> 789.76
really tried to emphasize no no no no

788.639 --> 792.24
guys

789.76 --> 793.4399999999999
pour in your best quality information

792.24 --> 794.88
because he's all hearing this for the

793.44 --> 796.639
first time you just need some time to

1180.08 --> 1182.72
sort of guy

1183.44 --> 1188.24
but that doesn't mean you have to make

1185.12 --> 1188.2399999999998
hot sock accounts

1188.559 --> 1193.84
to fight back ooh doesn't really help

1191.2 --> 1193.8400000000001
you know

1193.919 --> 1197.1200000000001

him spy i don't

1197.12 --> 1200.7199999999998
i mean this is open this is not a secret

1200.08 --> 1203.9189999999999
hangout

1200.72 --> 1205.84
everybody can see this everybody can see

1203.919 --> 1207.44
the flat earth early bird show if they

1205.84 --> 1211.039
tune in

1207.44 --> 1213.919
i know that and it stays up i've never

1211.039 --> 1215.039
ever taken down one of my shows and i

1213.919 --> 1216.48
never will

1215.039 --> 1218.8799999999999
because if there is an issue with

1216.48 --> 1222.48
anything that's happened i will simply

1218.88 --> 1225.0390000000002
address it as quickly as possible

1222.48 --> 1225.76
usually the next day sometimes even

1225.039 --> 1228.559
within

1225.76 --> 1230.96
the very hangout where it happens so i

1228.559 --> 1234.0
have nothing to hide

1230.96 --> 1237.76
and so very cute

1234.0 --> 1238.559
that people think that they can try to

1237.76 --> 1240.72
find some

1238.559 --> 1242.96
dirt on me with what i say well good

1240.72 --> 1246.159
luck with that

1242.96 --> 1248.799
good luck with that you know

1246.159 --> 1250.48
if you want you can try to profile me

1248.799 --> 1253.28
something that's fine

1250.48 --> 1254.559
yeah that's i have a lot of weird things

1253.28 --> 1257.76
about me

1254.559 --> 1258.08
i know makes you nervous doesn't it that

1257.76 --> 1261.12
i

1258.08 --> 1262.08
don't just try to hide every element

1261.12 --> 1264.799
about me

1262.08 --> 1266.72
including some of the more yeah closer

1264.799 --> 1269.76
to my ego things like everybody

1266.72 --> 1270.559
does and have has right everybody has

1269.76 --> 1272.32
that

1270.559 --> 1274.1589999999999
they all learn to deal with it or they

1272.32 --> 1275.76
don't and then it becomes a problem for

1274.159 --> 1278.7990000000002
everybody else

1275.76 --> 1282.48
yeah i know i'm a very open

1278.799 --> 1286.0
person i chose that

1282.48 --> 1289.1200000000001
shows that i'm kind of sick of

1286.0 --> 1290.559
yeah trying to hold back or hide

1289.12 --> 1294.2399999999998
elements about me that i

1290.559 --> 1298.0
have a need to express

1294.24 --> 1302.24
right so i'm not worried about anything

1298.0 --> 1305.6
you can spy on me all day you can record

1302.24 --> 1308.4
my live stream on your video and then

1305.6 --> 1309.039
spend like 20 hours trying to analyze it

1308.4 --> 1310.799
and

1309.039 --> 1312.48
i don't know make a video about it how

1310.799 --> 1315.36
it's all china called message

1312.48 --> 1318.4
if you like to people are just gonna

1315.36 --> 1321.6789999999999
think you're [ __ ] and insane

1318.4 --> 1325.2800000000002
okay unless they

1321.679 --> 1327.52
really like that and exclude everything

1325.28 --> 1330.32
else to witness just that because they

1327.52 --> 1332.1589999999999
want this nightmare vision

1330.32 --> 1333.52
version of the world that you have to

1332.159 --> 1336.4
present

1333.52 --> 1337.28
well that's their problem nobody gives a

1336.4 --> 1340.88
[ __ ]

1337.28 --> 1344.84
really and i've asked around

1340.88 --> 1347.8400000000001
so don't worry everything will be all

1344.84 --> 1347.84
right

1351.84 --> 1359.52
lane kessler well yeah could be

1356.32 --> 1360.1589999999999
could be maybe people can't handle

1359.52 --> 1362.08
themselves

1360.159 --> 1363.919
and they just want to squirt in my chat

1362.08 --> 1365.28
and they think oh maybe i shouldn't do

1363.919 --> 1366.64
that because it's going to get blocked

1365.28 --> 1368.799
yeah yeah absolutely

1366.64 --> 1369.679
i would if you're just going to come

1368.799 --> 1373.6
here to squirt

1369.679 --> 1376.48
yeah that's probably going to happen but

1373.6 --> 1379.9189999999999
if you just got a question or even like

1376.48 --> 1383.52
uh i don't believe in flat earth huh

1379.919 --> 1383.5200000000002
that's fine i'm not gonna block you

1384.0 --> 1387.28
you don't have to you you gotta figure

1386.4 --> 1390.72
out

1387.28 --> 1393.2
how it works how i work

1390.72 --> 1394.559
how i deal with my chat i've discussed

1393.2 --> 1396.96
this many times

1394.559 --> 1398.32
i really go after the intention and the

1396.96 --> 1403.8400000000001
behavior

1398.32 --> 1403.84
not after any specific opinion

1403.919 --> 1411.919
look guys i even come on i even

1407.2 --> 1415.1200000000001
unblocked jason mccormack okay

1411.919 --> 1417.919
now that you can't tell me that i just

1415.12 --> 1418.559
per definition block every every sort of

1417.919 --> 1422.5590000000002
opinion

1418.559 --> 1426.1589999999999
after that point right

1422.559 --> 1428.1589999999999
so don't be afraid it's just

1426.159 --> 1429.5200000000002
look out for your behavior because

1428.159 --> 1432.48
that's what can

1429.52 --> 1434.32
get you blocked not your opinions if you

1432.48 --> 1437.279
just formulate it

1434.32 --> 1438.559
for yeah formulate it like a civilized

1437.279 --> 1440.24
communicating person

1438.559 --> 1441.9189999999999
things will be all right it's okay to

1440.24 --> 1444.96
share your opinion even if it's very

1441.919 --> 1449.2
different from mine as long as you don't

1444.96 --> 1452.4
just start ad homing ridiculing

1449.2 --> 1455.44
to a disrespectful level things will be

1452.4 --> 1455.44
alright don't be afraid

1455.84 --> 1460.48
right hey ryan eartherton i saw your

1459.279 --> 1464.559
message

1460.48 --> 1464.559
in the discord it's cool

1469.76 --> 1476.829
and rob h

1473.64 --> 1476.8290000000002
[Music]

1483.76 --> 1487.84
right so finally some people in here

1488.4 --> 1495.1200000000001
are we all doing did anybody catch

1491.679 --> 1497.039
last night's 24 7 discord it was quite

1495.12 --> 1500.3999999999999
crowded

1497.039 --> 1515.84
and interesting

1500.4 --> 1515.8400000000001
it's the new time when

1523.45 --> 1526.6190000000001
[Music]

1526.84 --> 1529.84
this

1531.6 --> 1539.6
oh why uh i almost forgot

1535.44 --> 1542.159
i got my headphones in exactly when

1539.6 --> 1544.3999999999999
to come that's pretty damn cool look at

1542.159 --> 1544.4
this

1546.4 --> 1553.919
this cord is amazing right

1550.72 --> 1555.44
it's maybe not like the best of lookers

1553.919 --> 1557.76
but that's not what i did it for i did

1555.44 --> 1561.279
it for the music

1557.76 --> 1566.0
so i can basically just put it in there

1561.279 --> 1566.0
and then move around and

1566.4 --> 1573.039
pretty awesome and

1569.76 --> 1576.1589999999999
only cost me 35 euros so

1573.039 --> 1579.52
it was a bargain and i didn't have to

1576.159 --> 1581.7600000000002
go out to get it

1579.52 --> 1583.36
so yeah thanks for the support through

1581.76 --> 1587.039
the paypal and everything

1583.36 --> 1587.039
basically reimburse me for that

1587.279 --> 1590.32
hey chanterbing

1593.04 --> 1598.1589999999999
[Music]

1594.4 --> 1600.3200000000002
oh great thanks yeah i really looked at

1598.159 --> 1601.3600000000001
the reviews what people had to say about

1600.32 --> 1602.72
it because there were some other

1601.36 --> 1604.6399999999999
headphones that it was supposed

1602.72 --> 1606.159
good quality but like the frame was

1604.64 --> 1608.0
really

1606.159 --> 1609.3600000000001
a cheap ass plastic and all that so you

1608.0 --> 1611.76
got to be careful what you

1609.36 --> 1613.039
what you buy and it was pretty good

1611.76 --> 1616.24
choice i think

1613.039 --> 1617.279
relatively new production i think not

1616.24 --> 1619.279
even a year old

1617.279 --> 1621.6
and they're pretty good for that price

1619.279 --> 1621.6
at least

1621.919 --> 1626.96
it's pretty sweet so now i can listen

1625.039 --> 1627.679
music late at night if i feel like it

1626.96 --> 1630.159
without

1627.679 --> 1632.88
waking everybody up or getting annoyed

1630.159 --> 1635.2
by like a shitty headphone

1632.88 --> 1637.279
with a very short wire because that part

1635.2 --> 1640.64
was very annoying that

1637.279 --> 1644.96
can't yeah

1640.64 --> 1645.8400000000001
move around and i don't like wireless

1644.96 --> 1648.96
headphones

1645.84 --> 1651.52
safe to say i don't do anything wireless

1648.96 --> 1654.159
and yeah that would solve it i just can

1651.52 --> 1656.399
walk around and do whatever i i'm not

1654.159 --> 1660.5590000000002
gonna go there

1656.399 --> 1660.559
just out of principle i don't do that

1666.84 --> 1671.4399999999998
right

1668.159 --> 1672.0800000000002
so you guys want me to talk about

1671.44 --> 1675.919
something

1672.08 --> 1678.48
anything let it not be

1675.919 --> 1680.72
annoying people on the internet and the

1678.48 --> 1683.44
struggles between them

1680.72 --> 1685.1200000000001
but hey if you guys insist then i

1683.44 --> 1686.0800000000002
probably will talk about it if the

1685.12 --> 1687.6789999999999
alternative is that

1686.08 --> 1689.279
everybody's pretty much going to be

1687.679 --> 1691.1200000000001
silent

1689.279 --> 1693.039
you know and there is a lot of stuff

1691.12 --> 1697.36
going on concerning all that

1693.039 --> 1700.399
just like people

1697.36 --> 1702.24
several fronts going at one another

1700.399 --> 1703.9189999999999
and i think that even some people in

1702.24 --> 1707.039
here

1703.919 --> 1710.3200000000002
are well actively defending me

1707.039 --> 1713.039
and i really appreciate that

1710.32 --> 1714.1589999999999
although i do want to urge you to be

1713.039 --> 1718.08
very careful

1714.159 --> 1720.24
not to get too zealous like

1718.08 --> 1722.96
i try not to be too zealous i try to be

1720.24 --> 1722.96
very careful

1723.36 --> 1728.8799999999999
because yeah some of these people that

1725.679 --> 1728.88
do this they are

1729.12 --> 1732.8799999999999
like they'll go to places where you

1731.76 --> 1734.32
don't want to go

1732.88 --> 1736.0800000000002
you don't want to be dragged to those

1734.32 --> 1739.52
places it'll ruin you

1736.08 --> 1741.1999999999998
it will ruin your your peace of mind

1739.52 --> 1743.12
eventually so i want to warn you

1741.2 --> 1745.919
be careful now of course most of you

1743.12 --> 1745.9189999999999
already know that

1747.12 --> 1751.84
if you feel sad go watch my new youtube

1749.2 --> 1754.3990000000001
video it's comedy gold okay tara 306 i

1751.84 --> 1758.1589999999999
didn't know you have youtube videos

1754.399 --> 1759.6789999999999
huh cool you got a wrench if you want

1758.159 --> 1761.8400000000001
you can put the link of it

1759.679 --> 1764.0800000000002
in the chat i'll take a look somewhere

1761.84 --> 1767.84
later

1764.08 --> 1767.84
and good to see you by the way

1772.48 --> 1775.919
run over relative density disequilibrium

1775.2 --> 1778.799
please oh

1775.919 --> 1778.7990000000002
okay okay

1779.44 --> 1786.799
uh i guess i could do that

1782.96 --> 1790.3990000000001
it is an again highly debated issue

1786.799 --> 1792.399
and it's complex because of

1790.399 --> 1794.559
like this the physics terminology

1792.399 --> 1795.36
specifics and it seems to confuse a lot

1794.559 --> 1798.48
of people

1795.36 --> 1802.08
the entire concept of relative density

1798.48 --> 1804.24
right so

1802.08 --> 1806.0
okay i'll put it down relative density

1804.24 --> 1811.039
and the relative density theory

1806.0 --> 1814.88
scientific theory specifically states

1811.039 --> 1817.679
that or basically points at the effect

1814.88 --> 1818.7990000000002
of natural or what i now call i don't

1817.679 --> 1820.96
know if it's

1818.799 --> 1822.0
good that i call it that passive

1820.96 --> 1825.2
displacement

1822.0 --> 1828.559
that means that no mechanical or

1825.2 --> 1829.2
chemical thing is creating an obviously

1828.559 --> 1831.9189999999999
provable

1829.2 --> 1832.32
local force temporarily it's always

1831.919 --> 1834.3990000000001
there

1832.32 --> 1836.08
the effect is always there so cause a

1834.399 --> 1839.84
passive displacement

1836.08 --> 1843.039
of material right

1839.84 --> 1845.6789999999999
and the relative part is about

1843.039 --> 1847.279
the differential between the medium and

1845.679 --> 1849.2
the object's density

1847.279 --> 1851.12
that's the relative parts not relative

1849.2 --> 1852.96
direction anything you know it's a

1851.12 --> 1854.559
common misconception that especially

1852.96 --> 1856.559
globers like to use

1854.559 --> 1858.08
to confuse the [ __ ] out of it and this

1856.559 --> 1860.48
try to discredit it

1858.08 --> 1862.24
so there's no relative directions the

1860.48 --> 1865.279
relative part is only

1862.24 --> 1866.559
about the differential of the density

1865.279 --> 1869.12
between the medium

1866.559 --> 1871.279
and the density of the object and that

1869.12 --> 1873.9189999999999
is what causes

1871.279 --> 1876.24
yeah if there is a differential then we

1873.919 --> 1877.8400000000001
call that a disequilibrium because if

1876.24 --> 1879.84
there's an equilibrium between the

1877.84 --> 1881.519
density of the medium and the object

1879.84 --> 1882.9599999999998
there will be no displacement it will

1881.519 --> 1885.36
literally float

1882.96 --> 1886.799
right there because it's at equilibrium

1885.36 --> 1889.6789999999999
with its medium

1886.799 --> 1890.48
right but if it's not in equilibrium

1889.679 --> 1892.48
with its medium

1890.48 --> 1893.76
or in other words it's at this

1892.48 --> 1896.159
equilibrium

1893.76 --> 1897.679
then suddenly because of the

1896.159 --> 1901.279
disequilibrium

1897.679 --> 1904.96
a force is subjected

1901.279 --> 1908.159
and that force causes displacement

1904.96 --> 1910.08
and that displacement will be

1908.159 --> 1911.8400000000001
uh well for the object because the

1910.08 --> 1913.84
medium is just probably

1911.84 --> 1915.9189999999999
in a container it's not going to change

1913.84 --> 1918.84
it's where it is

1915.919 --> 1920.88
so the object will then displace two

1918.84 --> 1923.1999999999998
words where

1920.88 --> 1926.0800000000002
there would be an equilibrium between

1923.2 --> 1928.72
the density of the object and the medium

1926.08 --> 1929.76
so if the object is more dense than the

1928.72 --> 1932.84
medium

1929.76 --> 1934.8799999999999
it will move down because that is where

1932.84 --> 1937.6789999999999
naturally

1934.88 --> 1938.48
a denser part of the medium would be if

1937.679 --> 1941.3600000000001
any

1938.48 --> 1942.08
and then at some point there might be a

1941.36 --> 1945.039
floor

1942.08 --> 1946.24
which is just a solid object and then it

1945.039 --> 1949.039
will stop there

1946.24 --> 1950.799
it will still try to go down basically

1949.039 --> 1952.1589999999999
into the floor but because the floor is

1950.799 --> 1955.12
rigid

1952.159 --> 1956.3990000000001
the object cannot go there and it will

1955.12 --> 1959.36
be stuck

1956.399 --> 1961.039
at a disequilibrium point with its

1959.36 --> 1962.0
medium because it's still probably let's

1961.039 --> 1965.12
say surrounded by

1962.0 --> 1968.0
air let's say the object is a rock

1965.12 --> 1969.4399999999998
and the medium is air just regular air

1968.0 --> 1971.679
it's going to go down because it's

1969.44 --> 1973.3600000000001
obviously denser than the medium

1971.679 --> 1974.72
but then at some point it'll meet the

1973.36 --> 1976.8799999999999
ground and it can get

1974.72 --> 1977.919
into the ground in order to eventually

1976.88 --> 1980.7990000000002
find that

1977.919 --> 1981.519
actual equilibrium with its surroundings

1980.799 --> 1984.799
so then

1981.519 --> 1986.32
because it's stuck it's going to still

1984.799 --> 1989.2
be in this equilibrium

1986.32 --> 1990.399
and push down it will keep wanting to go

1989.2 --> 1992.799
that direction

1990.399 --> 1994.799
because it can't move it's obstructed

1992.799 --> 1998.6399999999999
it's going to cause

1994.799 --> 2001.76
pressure so instead of movement

1998.64 --> 2002.64
and acceleration this equilibrium will

2001.76 --> 2004.48
cause pressure

2002.64 --> 2006.88
because there's no more maneuvering room

2004.48 --> 2010.08
for the object to go into its

2006.88 --> 2013.2
equilibrium direction right

2010.08 --> 2016.72
and that pressure is then

2013.2 --> 2017.279
by humans in a convention translated

2016.72 --> 2020.64
into

2017.279 --> 2024.0
weight this weight is

2020.64 --> 2024.88
basically yeah how much pressure does it

2024.0 --> 2027.279
exert

2024.88 --> 2028.88
in a standard medium of air at ground

2027.279 --> 2031.279
level

2028.88 --> 2032.3200000000002
and then you have a scale to basically

2031.279 --> 2035.76
size up

2032.32 --> 2038.48
the squeeze and then

2035.76 --> 2039.84
give a number to that amount of pressure

2038.48 --> 2042.24
and we know that

2039.84 --> 2043.6
number as weight that's how we use it

2042.24 --> 2046.32
it's a convention

2043.6 --> 2047.84
we decide okay this is how much it

2046.32 --> 2049.04
weighs because of this amount of

2047.84 --> 2051.52
pressure

2049.04 --> 2053.919
right but yeah they don't mention that

2051.52 --> 2056.32
if you completely change the medium

2053.919 --> 2056.96
while weighing something like for

2056.32 --> 2060.639
example

2056.96 --> 2065.2
in water or something even heavier

2060.639 --> 2065.2000000000003
or in a vacuum then the

2066.079 --> 2069.119
when you call again the

2070.56 --> 2074.159
the differential between the objects

2073.52 --> 2075.7599999999998
density

2074.159 --> 2077.359
and the medium's density will be

2075.76 --> 2079.28
different because of that and

2077.359 --> 2080.48
cause an effective difference in

2079.28 --> 2084.48
pressure as well

2080.48 --> 2086.96
so that weight then becomes different

2084.48 --> 2087.52
they don't mention it this they just

2086.96 --> 2091.119
keep it

2087.52 --> 2093.7599999999998
to standard air medium weight

2091.119 --> 2094.8790000000004
air weight but in reality yeah you can

2093.76 --> 2096.48
have a vacuum weight

2094.879 --> 2099.04
and you can have a water weight now

2096.48 --> 2102.2400000000002
water weight is even officially used

2099.04 --> 2105.04
certain areas like for example

2102.24 --> 2106.16
water weight is used often to measure

2105.04 --> 2109.44
the

2106.16 --> 2111.7599999999998
the carrots they call it or yeah another

2109.44 --> 2112.96
other type of convention for weight of

2111.76 --> 2117.3590000000004
of gems

2112.96 --> 2119.2
like cut gems they water away it right

2117.359 --> 2122.4
i learned that in school in my

2119.2 --> 2125.7599999999998
goldsmithing school

2122.4 --> 2127.839
so that all has to do basically with

2125.76 --> 2129.599
what we now know as weight what is used

2127.839 --> 2132.88
in society as weight

2129.599 --> 2136.0
it all it is all derived from relative

2132.88 --> 2138.8
density disequilibrium in a standard

2136.0 --> 2140.96
error medium and the pressure it exerts

2138.8 --> 2143.2000000000003
when there is no more maneuvering room

2140.96 --> 2145.119
for the object to find its equilibrium

2143.2 --> 2147.04
within its medium

2145.119 --> 2148.7200000000003
and then it starts to exert pressure

2147.04 --> 2150.0
naturally because it's obstructed and

2148.72 --> 2153.52
that pressure

2150.0 --> 2156.96
is then translated and calculated into

2153.52 --> 2156.96
what we know as weight

2157.119 --> 2160.8
all right was that clear enough

2161.119 --> 2165.44
or do you need more just let me know in

2164.48 --> 2168.32
chat

2165.44 --> 2170.8
hello by the way guns have never run rmp

2168.32 --> 2175.28
[Music]

2170.8 --> 2175.28
gm west stone monkey 3d

2181.359 --> 2186.0789999999997
yeah you're welcome rob h if you need

2183.28 --> 2189.6800000000003
any expansion on that please let me know

2186.079 --> 2191.8390000000004
i think i put down the most of it

2189.68 --> 2194.0789999999997
but there's probably more details that

2191.839 --> 2196.0789999999997
we could get into it's just not really

2194.079 --> 2200.4
my specialization

2196.079 --> 2203.3590000000004
i think i think maybe like the

2200.4 --> 2205.359
the the flutter debate panel and people

2203.359 --> 2207.839
like brian could probably expand upon

2205.359 --> 2207.839
that more

2208.64 --> 2212.7999999999997
oh really chanterbing best explanation

2211.599 --> 2215.04
so far okay

2212.8 --> 2217.3590000000004
well thank you you honor me i do my best

2215.04 --> 2218.32
to really get it as cleared up as

2217.359 --> 2222.4
possible

2218.32 --> 2226.839
so i thank you i'm glad it helped

2222.4 --> 2230.8
hey brendam hello twad

2226.839 --> 2230.7999999999997
wassel day to you too

2240.32 --> 2243.599
right okay it's done monkey 3d is i

2243.04 --> 2247.52
think

2243.599 --> 2247.52
trying to give a counter argument

2247.92 --> 2250.8
i'm not sure though

2250.96 --> 2258.0
i said that three minutes ago okay

2254.32 --> 2261.44
you have same effect appears

2258.0 --> 2262.8
laterally in a laterally accelerating

2261.44 --> 2265.76
frame of reference

2262.8 --> 2266.96
what along the direction of acceleration

2265.76 --> 2268.8
what that's a lot of

2266.96 --> 2270.079
acceleration and frames of reference

2268.8 --> 2273.6800000000003
sounds almost like you're talking about

2270.079 --> 2273.6800000000003
the coriolis effect or something

2274.16 --> 2280.7999999999997
but yeah that vernacular doesn't really

2277.359 --> 2282.4
coincide with the relative density

2280.8 --> 2284.96
theory

2282.4 --> 2286.56
because there's not really a lot of

2284.96 --> 2289.68
explanation as to

2286.56 --> 2292.56
the acceleration or any relations

2289.68 --> 2294.3199999999997
between the moving thing it's only the

2292.56 --> 2296.0789999999997
only thing that's really part of the

2294.32 --> 2299.6800000000003
relative density theory

2296.079 --> 2303.44
is the relation the differential between

2299.68 --> 2306.72
the density of the object and the medium

2303.44 --> 2308.4
now what actually happens with an object

2306.72 --> 2310.3199999999997
that is displacing because of relative

2308.4 --> 2312.7200000000003
density this equilibrium

2310.32 --> 2313.52
yeah it accelerates surely but it's

2312.72 --> 2317.2
literally

2313.52 --> 2320.079
completely irrelevant all that's known

2317.2 --> 2321.04
is that there is basically a force

2320.079 --> 2323.2000000000003
introduced

2321.04 --> 2325.44
because of the disequilibrium the

2323.2 --> 2329.2799999999997
relative density this equilibrium

2325.44 --> 2331.68
is the force it causes the force right

2329.28 --> 2333.6800000000003
that eventually results in acceleration

2331.68 --> 2336.0
or when there's no maneuvering room

2333.68 --> 2339.52
in that pressure that has then been

2336.0 --> 2343.04
translated into the convention of weight

2339.52 --> 2344.079
right but it's completely irrelevant to

2343.04 --> 2346.24
the actual

2344.079 --> 2347.52
mechanical workings of the relative

2346.24 --> 2350.64
density theory

2347.52 --> 2352.4
because all that's required to know is

2350.64 --> 2354.64
the differential

2352.4 --> 2356.88
between the density of the medium and

2354.64 --> 2358.96
the density of the object at all times

2356.88 --> 2360.8
that there is displacement going on is

2358.96 --> 2364.88
completely irrelevant

2360.8 --> 2367.92
to the functioning of

2364.88 --> 2371.92
why the displacement happens you see

2367.92 --> 2371.92
it's not relevant in the experiment

2373.04 --> 2376.56
did i finish excalibur no i haven't yet

2375.76 --> 2379.0400000000004
i didn't

2376.56 --> 2379.599
get to that i will though it's a great

2379.04 --> 2383.119
movie

2379.599 --> 2385.599
i'm very impressed by it

2383.119 --> 2387.6800000000003
sounds very scientific yeah it is it is

2385.599 --> 2389.839
scientifically proven fact

2387.68 --> 2391.839
relative density theory is scientific

2389.839 --> 2393.52
fact it's repeatable it's empiric it

2391.839 --> 2396.4
abides by the scientific method

2393.52 --> 2397.92
it's been demonstrated endlessly and

2396.4 --> 2401.119
another funny part about it

2397.92 --> 2403.119
it's extremely easy

2401.119 --> 2404.4
to find examples of it in nature because

2403.119 --> 2407.52
it's literally happening

2404.4 --> 2407.52
everywhere at all time

2407.92 --> 2412.56
happens everywhere and you can very

2410.56 --> 2415.44
easily demonstrate it in many different

2412.56 --> 2417.52
ways to yourself how it works

2415.44 --> 2419.359
and i've said it before there could

2417.52 --> 2422.4
literally be

2419.359 --> 2425.68
mathematical formulas

2422.4 --> 2427.599
that could basically express exactly

2425.68 --> 2428.8799999999997
the workings of it i've just never

2427.599 --> 2430.6400000000003
really gotten to it

2428.88 --> 2432.56
but i've already pointed out there's the

2430.64 --> 2433.5989999999997
differential the differential of the

2432.56 --> 2435.839
density

2433.599 --> 2438.8
the medium and the object that's already

2435.839 --> 2440.64
kind of mathematical because it matters

2438.8 --> 2443.3590000000004
the bigger the differential

2440.64 --> 2444.16
the bigger the force the quicker it will

2443.359 --> 2446.88
fall or

2444.16 --> 2448.64
rise and the more the pressure will be

2446.88 --> 2450.1600000000003
in that

2448.64 --> 2451.68
differential if the differential is

2450.16 --> 2455.52
higher there will be more pressure

2451.68 --> 2455.52
see so vacuum weight

2456.0 --> 2459.44
when the medium is a vacuum will

2458.0 --> 2463.2
effectively cause

2459.44 --> 2466.319
more pressure more weight you see

2463.2 --> 2469.68
so that's

2466.319 --> 2472.72
those are the relevant parts but there's

2469.68 --> 2474.7999999999997
actually the reference frames or

2472.72 --> 2475.839
the acceleration how that works it's

2474.8 --> 2478.96
it's completely

2475.839 --> 2482.64
superfluous it has no relation no

2478.96 --> 2484.0
no relevance to the relative density

2482.64 --> 2486.7999999999997
theory

2484.0 --> 2488.48
because relative density theory has

2486.8 --> 2491.92
everything it needs

2488.48 --> 2493.92
in knowing the differential

2491.92 --> 2496.56
between the density of the object and

2493.92 --> 2498.64
the density of the medium you see

2496.56 --> 2500.16
that's the only really relevant data and

2498.64 --> 2503.5989999999997
that's the thing that's being

2500.16 --> 2506.48
varied and manipulated in order to

2503.599 --> 2507.839
prove the effects the displacement

2506.48 --> 2509.76
because of relative density this

2507.839 --> 2512.7999999999997
equilibrium

2509.76 --> 2514.88
the medium or potentially the object's

2512.8 --> 2516.319
density the average density could be

2514.88 --> 2518.96
altered and therefore

2516.319 --> 2520.48
thereby causing it is equilibrium and a

2518.96 --> 2523.839
displacement

2520.48 --> 2525.44
that's the experiment anthony reilly

2523.839 --> 2527.119
sleeping warrior has demonstrated this

2525.44 --> 2529.839
many times and causes

2527.119 --> 2530.7200000000003
caused a whole lot of ruckus on every

2529.839 --> 2532.48
front

2530.72 --> 2534.48
people just not wanting to accept it

2532.48 --> 2537.68
they just want to

2534.48 --> 2550.079
reify the concept of gravity

2537.68 --> 2551.5989999999997
of course

2550.079 --> 2554.1600000000003
all right that's that's correct yeah i

2551.599 --> 2555.28
argued for that when i was still arguing

2554.16 --> 2557.1189999999997
for gravity

2555.28 --> 2558.7200000000003
before i figured out that it's

2557.119 --> 2561.52
scientifically invalid

2558.72 --> 2562.24
and a reification fallacy but yes if

2561.52 --> 2564.16
there is

2562.24 --> 2566.0789999999997
an acceleration happening in some other

2564.16 --> 2570.16
way

2566.079 --> 2573.119
an accelerating vehicle for example yeah

2570.16 --> 2574.64
then there is an apparent within the

2573.119 --> 2578.079
medium which is moving

2574.64 --> 2581.7599999999998
so yeah it's different there

2578.079 --> 2583.52
manifests an apparent axial direction

2581.76 --> 2585.3590000000004
change for the relative density

2583.52 --> 2588.4
displacement i

2585.359 --> 2590.839
agree that seems to happen

2588.4 --> 2593.04
however because the entire thing is

2590.839 --> 2596.0789999999997
moving that's literally just

2593.04 --> 2598.56
other another force being introduced so

2596.079 --> 2599.599
the relative density this equilibrium

2598.56 --> 2601.92
forces are still

2599.599 --> 2603.3590000000004
in effect but there is other forces

2601.92 --> 2606.48
introduced

2603.359 --> 2607.92
right so that changes the apparent

2606.48 --> 2609.599
direction

2607.92 --> 2610.96
but it's still overlooking that the

2609.599 --> 2614.2400000000002
whole thing

2610.96 --> 2618.079
is moving in that case

2614.24 --> 2620.9599999999996
so yeah it's just what appears to be an

2618.079 --> 2623.52
axial direction change for the relative

2620.96 --> 2625.2
density displacement direction

2623.52 --> 2627.52
it's just appearances because the whole

2625.2 --> 2630.16
thing is moving you see

2627.52 --> 2632.64
it's kind of complex like that but that

2630.16 --> 2635.68
does happen i agree

2632.64 --> 2637.839
and there also by in for example the

2635.68 --> 2639.359
vomit comet plane if you dive down with

2637.839 --> 2643.119
an accelerated fashion

2639.359 --> 2646.72
then you can appear to neutralize

2643.119 --> 2650.0
the relative density displacement

2646.72 --> 2652.72
you can appear to neutralize it

2650.0 --> 2655.76
and things will in that situation seem

2652.72 --> 2658.8799999999997
to float within the entire medium

2655.76 --> 2662.0
that is part of an object that is

2658.88 --> 2665.119
accelerating right then it

2662.0 --> 2667.359
appears like like it's neutralized

2665.119 --> 2669.28
but that's technically not true because

2667.359 --> 2671.44
the whole thing is displacing

2669.28 --> 2672.96
it's just that the the medium in which

2671.44 --> 2676.48
the objects

2672.96 --> 2678.16
fall because it is falling the medium is

2676.48 --> 2680.96
falling with it

2678.16 --> 2682.8799999999997
so the object in that falling medium is

2680.96 --> 2685.28
still trying to find its equilibrium but

2682.88 --> 2688.48
the whole medium is moving in lockstep

2685.28 --> 2690.4
with its fall you see

2688.48 --> 2692.16
so relative density has not been

2690.4 --> 2695.2000000000003
neutralized

2692.16 --> 2697.359
effectively it just seems like it's

2695.2 --> 2700.56
neutralized because the whole thing

2697.359 --> 2703.44
is falling you see

2700.56 --> 2705.839
it's kind of tricky like that but that's

2703.44 --> 2705.839
how it works

2709.76 --> 2717.0400000000004
yes the plane would definitely be

2713.119 --> 2720.079
isolated or at least like the

2717.04 --> 2722.4
the compartment within in which

2720.079 --> 2724.319
yeah the effect is achieved because if

2722.4 --> 2727.04
the medium

2724.319 --> 2727.68
would be open then it would be pushed

2727.04 --> 2731.359
around

2727.68 --> 2734.0
and rushed through in the fall

2731.359 --> 2736.0789999999997
so then there would be no effective

2734.0 --> 2737.599
neutralization things would simply blow

2736.079 --> 2747.8390000000004
out of the plane

2737.599 --> 2747.839
right this is all logic

2748.319 --> 2750.56
what

2756.319 --> 2761.44
find the egg experiment yeah it's

2758.079 --> 2763.44
sleeping word

2761.44 --> 2764.48
sleeping warrior channel i'll link him

2763.44 --> 2767.52
up

2764.48 --> 2768.72
he's in in my favorite list too i really

2767.52 --> 2772.16
respect the guy

2768.72 --> 2774.2599999999998
he's done a lot of work

2772.16 --> 2777.3889999999997
for the flat earth debate

2774.26 --> 2777.389
[Music]

2783.2 --> 2790.72
i've been recently just talking a lot

2787.359 --> 2791.7599999999998
about other things about like protest

2790.72 --> 2795.7599999999998
situations

2791.76 --> 2798.3190000000004
in in the uk and all

2795.76 --> 2799.3590000000004
so it's been a while since he stuck only

2798.319 --> 2801.92
to

2799.359 --> 2802.96
flat earth and to his relative density

2801.92 --> 2806.48
experiment

2802.96 --> 2806.48
let's see if i can find something

2808.8 --> 2813.76
oh that's that's a lot of scrolling

2814.8 --> 2819.28
i think that you could probably comment

2817.839 --> 2822.319
on one of his videos

2819.28 --> 2824.2400000000002
and then ask about it like hey tony

2822.319 --> 2825.839
or sleeping warrior can you please link

2824.24 --> 2830.72
me up to the

2825.839 --> 2832.4
relative density experiment video

2830.72 --> 2834.16
and he'll probably respond to you

2832.4 --> 2835.52
because he's very eager to share all

2834.16 --> 2837.68
that information

2835.52 --> 2839.52
because he worked for that right so

2837.68 --> 2842.0
here's the

2839.52 --> 2843.599
link to sleeping wars youtube channel

2842.0 --> 2849.359
subscribe to him now

2843.599 --> 2849.3590000000004
he's awesome oh i think he's awesome

2849.599 --> 2854.4
and he always brings very interesting

2851.839 --> 2855.44
judicial details to the table because he

2854.4 --> 2859.599
is

2855.44 --> 2863.119
like into that

2859.599 --> 2864.559
and he's done he's dedicated a portion

2863.119 --> 2867.28
of his time

2864.559 --> 2869.92
a few years back to the relative density

2867.28 --> 2869.92
experiment

2871.52 --> 2875.04
yeah guns have never owned rmp i i agree

2874.319 --> 2877.839
i was

2875.04 --> 2881.2799999999997
very much overwhelmed by the movie i i

2877.839 --> 2882.7999999999997
got to one hour and 45 minutes

2881.28 --> 2885.28
and then i just had to break it's

2882.8 --> 2887.2000000000003
another 45 minutes

2885.28 --> 2888.44
but i'm extremely impressed by it

2887.2 --> 2891.5589999999997
extremely impressive

2888.44 --> 2891.559
[Music]

2891.68 --> 2896.0
it's so intense and raw it's

2894.559 --> 2899.44
unbelievable i've never seen

2896.0 --> 2901.599
anything like this not just the arthur

2899.44 --> 2904.8
movies just any move we have never seen

2901.599 --> 2910.319
any movie like this before

2904.8 --> 2910.319
it's so raw just so unapologetic it's

2912.839 --> 2915.839
amazing

2920.96 --> 2923.599
i don't know

2924.559 --> 2928.6400000000003
there were some there's some weird

2926.24 --> 2932.4799999999996
things that happened

2928.64 --> 2932.48
i've heard some things it was pretty

2933.04 --> 2935.359
weird

2938.079 --> 2941.92
but it's all rumors basically i heard

2939.92 --> 2942.88
like he got arrested for something and

2941.92 --> 2946.16
then he

2942.88 --> 2947.119
asked people to donate for bill and then

2946.16 --> 2949.7599999999998
i heard

2947.119 --> 2950.7200000000003
no confirmation i no confirmation so

2949.76 --> 2953.8390000000004
please

2950.72 --> 2955.5989999999997
don't mean to like

2953.839 --> 2957.599
poison the well or anything but i heard

2955.599 --> 2958.7200000000003
that like he didn't actually even need

2957.599 --> 2962.6400000000003
that money to bill

2958.72 --> 2964.3999999999996
it was just it was only if he would then

2962.64 --> 2966.96
commit an offense that he would have to

2964.4 --> 2968.64
pay that but he didn't

2966.96 --> 2971.28
so that was kind of weird i don't know

2968.64 --> 2974.72
what happened after that

2971.28 --> 2974.7200000000003
i haven't seen him in for a while

2975.119 --> 2981.28
so weird situations

2979.44 --> 2982.64
that might have just been a mistake or

2981.28 --> 2985.0400000000004
something you know i i

2982.64 --> 2987.04
i'm not i don't like the judge until i

2985.04 --> 2989.359
like really know what what actually

2987.04 --> 2989.359
happened

2996.8 --> 3002.88
yeah guns have never run r p i i i

3000.0 --> 3004.0
i take it you saw it recently because

3002.88 --> 3007.2000000000003
that's exactly

3004.0 --> 3007.839
how i felt i was so impressed i even

3007.2 --> 3010.64
kind of

3007.839 --> 3012.0
i even basically asked owen benjamin

3010.64 --> 3015.2
during his livestream have you seen

3012.0 --> 3018.96
this movie it's amazing i i

3015.2 --> 3027.839
rarely do that i was just so impressed

3018.96 --> 3027.839
by it

3029.2 --> 3031.52
right

3036.96 --> 3042.0
would we experience this or a form of it

3039.92 --> 3044.4
if the earth was a globe falling around

3042.0 --> 3044.4
the sun

3045.68 --> 3049.1189999999997
that's i don't know how to respond to

3048.64 --> 3052.0
that

3049.119 --> 3052.0
[ __ ] was all

3052.319 --> 3056.8
because none of that what you propose

3054.96 --> 3059.76
makes any sense yeah how would

3056.8 --> 3060.4
what is actually empirically provable

3059.76 --> 3063.8390000000004
work

3060.4 --> 3064.96
in that weird model conception i have no

3063.839 --> 3067.2799999999997
idea because

3064.96 --> 3069.04
there it's supposedly gravity that does

3067.28 --> 3071.119
things

3069.04 --> 3073.52
even though it's not even technically

3071.119 --> 3075.839
explained how it's supposed to do that

3073.52 --> 3077.52
it's also screwed up i would know how

3075.839 --> 3080.5589999999997
relative density

3077.52 --> 3083.52
works on the globe model

3080.559 --> 3084.96
no idea i don't even know like how how

3083.52 --> 3087.52
it's supposed to work

3084.96 --> 3089.28
keeping the gas pressure to the ball in

3087.52 --> 3091.7599999999998
the face of the outer space universe

3089.28 --> 3093.92
without a container

3091.76 --> 3094.88
specific to the earth because gravity

3093.92 --> 3098.559
isn't a container

3094.88 --> 3100.559
it's not a force and it cannot

3098.559 --> 3102.88
countermand the second law of

3100.559 --> 3104.4
thermodynamics which dictates that gas

3102.88 --> 3106.48
pressure will expand in all directions

3104.4 --> 3111.839
to meet the volume of the available

3106.48 --> 3111.839
container so yeah

3117.68 --> 3125.839
oh dude

3121.28 --> 3125.8390000000004
that's awesome

3127.44 --> 3139.18
right yeah i was just a baby when that

3129.76 --> 3142.8100000000004
movie came out

3139.18 --> 3142.81
[Music]

3144.72 --> 3153.839
yeah yeah i heard that here we go again

3148.24 --> 3153.839
thanks for the update

3157.76 --> 3160.8
i don't know what happened i haven't

3159.839 --> 3164.64
really kept track

3160.8 --> 3164.6400000000003
and i haven't seen him live streaming

3164.8 --> 3167.8390000000004
for a while

3186.8 --> 3190.96
right anyway uh

3192.839 --> 3197.359
anything else i just explained about

3196.0 --> 3200.4
relative density i thought it was a

3197.359 --> 3209.839
pretty good explanation anything else

3200.4 --> 3209.839
you guys want me to address

3220.839 --> 3223.839
hmm

3230.48 --> 3237.839
oh right stone monkey 3d thank you

3238.64 --> 3244.72
no no please

3242.16 --> 3245.7599999999998
why why i don't want to talk about

3244.72 --> 3249.4399999999996
vaccinations

3245.76 --> 3251.599
i just don't do it don't do it no matter

3249.44 --> 3255.839
what

3251.599 --> 3259.44
but that yeah look guys i

3255.839 --> 3260.64
this point it's so unbelievably

3259.44 --> 3263.119
dangerous

3260.64 --> 3264.96
you know like maybe a hundred years ago

3263.119 --> 3265.839
there were just doctors doing it right

3264.96 --> 3269.04
and

3265.839 --> 3271.2
was all honest based on on

3269.04 --> 3272.319
what they learned about it in medical

3271.2 --> 3274.96
school right

3272.319 --> 3276.839
they would just but nowadays these mega

3274.96 --> 3279.839
corporations and

3276.839 --> 3283.599
just

3279.839 --> 3286.319
it's so dangerous like if you care for a

3283.599 --> 3286.319
long-term

3286.72 --> 3290.319
like if you want your bloodline to

3288.72 --> 3294.72
continue i

3290.319 --> 3297.119
recommend against vaccinations entirely

3294.72 --> 3297.1189999999997
all right

3300.16 --> 3305.5989999999997
it's messed up and yes i've heard

3303.2 --> 3307.1189999999997
seen the articles everywhere all these

3305.599 --> 3310.88
trial runs and people

3307.119 --> 3313.119
die and get horrific brain injury or

3310.88 --> 3321.839
whatever organ damage i

3313.119 --> 3321.839
it's like come on people come on

3326.24 --> 3331.1189999999997
oh yeah oh yeah i heard that thank you

3328.799 --> 3333.44
stonemonkey3d for reminding me yeah elon

3331.119 --> 3336.88
musk starship crashed last night

3333.44 --> 3340.799
it was it kind of like

3336.88 --> 3341.839
it was on on video it tried to land was

3340.799 --> 3343.92
interesting looking

3341.839 --> 3348.0
but like it landed too hard and then

3343.92 --> 3350.16
basically it crunched itself open

3348.0 --> 3352.4
all right i'll laugh about it if you

3350.16 --> 3352.3999999999996
want

3353.44 --> 3356.16
i i yeah

3357.599 --> 3362.0
i don't know it's just that people that

3359.76 --> 3364.2400000000002
believe in that

3362.0 --> 3366.72
i think i don't know though does anybody

3364.24 --> 3370.0789999999997
believe in it still maybe some kids

3366.72 --> 3373.2
they're just going to be sad so

3370.079 --> 3376.96
i don't know why did that happen

3373.2 --> 3380.0
well maybe he is like eager to

3376.96 --> 3384.96
try out a new model or something

3380.0 --> 3384.96
now he has a reason to do that i don't

3388.839 --> 3391.839
know

3402.079 --> 3409.28
now come on control the explosion why

3406.079 --> 3412.079
would you say that it just crashed

3409.28 --> 3414.079
it's just supposed controlled landing

3412.079 --> 3416.319
land too hard and then it cracked itself

3414.079 --> 3419.44
open from the impact it's

3416.319 --> 3421.359
it's not a control explosion

3419.44 --> 3425.04
it wasn't much of an explosion it just

3421.359 --> 3425.04
burst open in flame that's it

3427.92 --> 3434.799
says fuel pressure dropped

3431.04 --> 3439.68
so engines didn't get enough fuel huh

3434.799 --> 3439.68
okay cgi yeah come on

3443.76 --> 3450.6400000000003
i know there has been cgi

3447.119 --> 3453.359
pretty silly looking cgi right

3450.64 --> 3454.5589999999997
but what i saw that that's not cgi i

3453.359 --> 3456.88
don't think so

3454.559 --> 3459.2000000000003
maybe i'm wrong though maybe maybe it'll

3456.88 --> 3460.799
turn out to be cgi after all i just took

3459.2 --> 3464.319
one glimpse at it

3460.799 --> 3464.319
just watched that video one time

3470.88 --> 3477.76
yeah that's rough stuff

3474.72 --> 3488.64
jim west don't do it just

3477.76 --> 3491.6800000000003
don't don't take it

3488.64 --> 3494.8799999999997
yes i know terra 306 i've seen

3491.68 --> 3497.359
like elon musk associated videos where

3494.88 --> 3499.839
he supposedly demonstrates

3497.359 --> 3502.64
these things where it is just blatantly

3499.839 --> 3506.72
cgi it's been treated everywhere

3502.64 --> 3510.5589999999997
even on globe busters and and

3506.72 --> 3511.1189999999997
gerunds them like treated that specific

3510.559 --> 3513.52
thing

3511.119 --> 3517.839
to no end with video and all that so

3513.52 --> 3517.839
yeah i know

3533.599 --> 3545.04
ah i'm getting kind of hungry i haven't

3535.04 --> 3547.359
really had breakfast yet

3545.04 --> 3547.359
oh

3549.76 --> 3553.0400000000004
that's wow guns have never owned those

3552.16 --> 3559.52
are all

3553.04 --> 3561.7599999999998
really good movies

3559.52 --> 3561.7599999999998
like

3562.96 --> 3566.64
before i knew excalibur i think that

3564.799 --> 3568.799
conan and barbara no it's still a tough

3566.64 --> 3570.48
match but conan barbarian the first ones

3568.799 --> 3572.96
just

3570.48 --> 3574.72
it was the best movie that i is one of

3572.96 --> 3575.92
the most inspiring movies to say at

3574.72 --> 3578.9599999999996
least to me

3575.92 --> 3581.52
many ways and i've seen escape from new

3578.96 --> 3585.04
york it's a classic it's like

3581.52 --> 3588.079
pretty astounding movie how that worked

3585.04 --> 3590.16
it's relatively low budget but just it

3588.079 --> 3593.119
really worked the whole thing the

3590.16 --> 3593.1189999999997
atmosphere was so

3594.36 --> 3597.4990000000003
[Music]

3598.839 --> 3601.839
convincing

3604.319 --> 3608.88
he's elon musk even the lydia engineer

3606.48 --> 3610.96
no no i don't think so

3608.88 --> 3612.88
he's just a guy that's been handed a lot

3610.96 --> 3615.839
of money

3612.88 --> 3615.839
and this is what he does

3624.079 --> 3630.6400000000003
oh god really rob h

3628.319 --> 3643.839
they're picking astronauts for upcoming

3630.64 --> 3643.839
moon expedition

3651.119 --> 3657.839
bill gates real founder i don't know man

3661.68 --> 3667.5989999999997
then yeah bill gates is a giant octopus

3665.28 --> 3668.3190000000004
and he's got his tentacles in a lot of

3667.599 --> 3670.319
things

3668.319 --> 3672.96
for a long time that that was even in

3670.319 --> 3672.96
the 90s

3675.28 --> 3679.76
he's all over this corona situation

3680.72 --> 3684.0789999999997
he's all over well the computer world

3683.68 --> 3686.48
still

3684.079 --> 3687.76
although not as bad as it used to be

3686.48 --> 3691.44
when he really

3687.76 --> 3693.44
actively helped destroy

3691.44 --> 3695.28
computer programmer initiatives and all

3693.44 --> 3699.839
that terrible

3695.28 --> 3699.8390000000004
terrible the damage he's done

3699.92 --> 3702.88
what the hell is that

3703.119 --> 3713.839
it's like casler come on

3706.96 --> 3713.839
that's that's unbelievably silly

3724.839 --> 3727.839
laughs

3738.839 --> 3741.839
ugh

3744.319 --> 3750.72
fine ryan earthen i i just

3747.839 --> 3752.839
the thing is with me you know i don't

3750.72 --> 3757.359
really care

3752.839 --> 3758.5589999999997
like every bit of attention i'll allow

3757.359 --> 3763.359
that guy to have

3758.559 --> 3763.3590000000004
in my mind is like literally a waste

3763.76 --> 3768.1600000000003
so i try to just not let him in in any

3767.599 --> 3770.4
way

3768.16 --> 3771.2
because i've hated bill gates for a long

3770.4 --> 3773.839
time

3771.2 --> 3775.5989999999997
like i pretty much hold him responsible

3773.839 --> 3778.5589999999997
for destroying the

3775.599 --> 3778.559
commodore brand

3778.799 --> 3783.599
alright and i'll never forgive him for

3782.319 --> 3785.44
that

3783.599 --> 3787.44
now of course the commodore company

3785.44 --> 3790.4
eventually pretty much destroyed itself

3787.44 --> 3794.0
with its own stupidity

3790.4 --> 3794.48
like a terrible game computer they tried

3794.0 --> 3796.72
to make

3794.48 --> 3797.92
terrible they never should have done

3796.72 --> 3800.0789999999997
that but

3797.92 --> 3803.6800000000003
like the whole grounds were just being

3800.079 --> 3806.4
ruined by this bill gates guy

3803.68 --> 3808.0789999999997
there's probably been like a lot of

3806.4 --> 3810.4
programmers that were

3808.079 --> 3811.92
really great that freaking killed

3810.4 --> 3812.48
themselves because of that son of a

3811.92 --> 3815.599
[ __ ]

3812.48 --> 3818.799
okay horrific

3815.599 --> 3821.6800000000003
what he's done but

3818.799 --> 3823.68
yeah so i just i don't care i only think

3821.68 --> 3824.72
i know about him is he's disgusting i

3823.68 --> 3828.5589999999997
hate him

3824.72 --> 3831.5989999999997
can't wait until he's till it's over

3828.559 --> 3833.119
that's it and he's freaking insanely

3831.599 --> 3836.799
rich and

3833.119 --> 3838.4
out of his mind and evil and obsessed

3836.799 --> 3840.559
with eugenics

3838.4 --> 3843.28
and everybody knows that he's brazen

3840.559 --> 3843.28
about it so

3843.599 --> 3853.839
why do you even want to know details

3845.44 --> 3853.839
about his life it's all just disgusting

3860.64 --> 3867.839
i seem tired no no not so much i'm a

3863.599 --> 3867.839
little hungry

3878.81 --> 3894.5589999999997
[Music]

3880.0 --> 3909.119
stone monkey 3d that's interesting

3894.559 --> 3910.7200000000003
i don't know

3909.119 --> 3912.799
all right well concerns of around that's

3910.72 --> 3915.9199999999996
not even

3912.799 --> 3917.7599999999998
most likely it's just the fact it's like

3915.92 --> 3919.52
historical registered fact

3917.76 --> 3921.5200000000004
you can literally look it up on

3919.52 --> 3924.799
wikipedia almost

3921.52 --> 3925.7599999999998
to that level so yeah he is groomed for

3924.799 --> 3929.0389999999998
power

3925.76 --> 3930.88
his his dad was his dad

3929.039 --> 3934.7990000000004
was like one of the most prominent

3930.88 --> 3936.88
eugenicists in the 20th century

3934.799 --> 3938.319
like he was one of almost one of the

3936.88 --> 3942.1600000000003
founders you could say

3938.319 --> 3945.52
right and yeah

3942.16 --> 3947.839
bill gates was like his his satanic

3945.52 --> 3949.839
little prince follow-up

3947.839 --> 3951.52
inheriting everything and just being

3949.839 --> 3953.839
taught like yeah just destroy

3951.52 --> 3955.52
everything and take absolute power so

3953.839 --> 3960.48
that eventually we can just

3955.52 --> 3960.48
force the world to commit suicide

3961.34 --> 3964.489
[Music]

3965.839 --> 3969.52
this is punishment will gates get after

3968.559 --> 3973.52
this demise i

3969.52 --> 3973.52
i don't even want to try to imagine it

3975.28 --> 3980.2400000000002
tear it i don't want it i don't wanna

3977.599 --> 3980.2400000000002
imagine it

3981.92 --> 3993.839
but it's gonna be pretty terrible i'm

3984.48 --> 3993.839
pretty sure that

4000.599 --> 4007.839
hwga what does that mean

4019.359 --> 4022.4
what if they understand oh that's a good

4020.799 --> 4024.72
question actually terret it's a

4022.4 --> 4025.599
very a young man's question it's a good

4024.72 --> 4027.1189999999997
one

4025.599 --> 4030.0
they understand this place better than

4027.119 --> 4033.599
us why do they commit such sins

4030.0 --> 4035.44
because they want to because what they

4033.599 --> 4038.1600000000003
figured out to be the truth

4035.44 --> 4038.88
they deemed unacceptable and when they

4038.16 --> 4041.839
figured out

4038.88 --> 4044.4
how much god is actually in control of

4041.839 --> 4044.4
all things

4044.48 --> 4049.839
they thought i cannot we don't

4048.0 --> 4051.119
accept this we're going to do everything

4049.839 --> 4055.599
in our power to just

4051.119 --> 4057.839
make him hurt for the perceived slavery

4055.599 --> 4060.1600000000003
that they see in what they've learned

4057.839 --> 4063.119
you see

4060.16 --> 4065.52
they think it's slavery they think they

4063.119 --> 4067.039
have no freedom because of creation

4065.52 --> 4070.72
so they will do everything in their

4067.039 --> 4070.7200000000003
power to recreation as

4070.799 --> 4074.4
as a response the essence core essence

4073.76 --> 4077.44
of

4074.4 --> 4079.76
like demonic possession even

4077.44 --> 4080.799
it's totally it's pure iron man it's

4079.76 --> 4082.7990000000004
just

4080.799 --> 4084.96
inacceptance of what is reality that's

4082.799 --> 4087.839
what it comes down to in acceptance

4084.96 --> 4088.799
of what is reality now they think they

4087.839 --> 4091.92
know it

4088.799 --> 4096.239
but they don't accept it

4091.92 --> 4098.719
right the problem is even if they did

4096.239 --> 4100.159
know the reality because they don't

4098.719 --> 4102.64
accept it

4100.159 --> 4103.5199999999995
they lose their minds and then

4102.64 --> 4107.52
eventually

4103.52 --> 4111.040000000001
they start to believe in the lies

4107.52 --> 4112.080000000001
that they made to try to destroy the

4111.04 --> 4114.64
world

4112.08 --> 4115.759
and then they become that lie and now

4114.64 --> 4118.4800000000005
they no longer

4115.759 --> 4119.92
really know the truth they've forgotten

4118.48 --> 4121.44
and it's like a blessing because

4119.92 --> 4123.6
suddenly they deal out all this

4121.44 --> 4125.839
punishment

4123.6 --> 4127.120000000001
but they don't really know anymore why

4125.839 --> 4129.04
for real

4127.12 --> 4130.96
so every time they're reminded about

4129.04 --> 4132.96
what is reality then they become

4130.96 --> 4134.88
really furious again because they're

4132.96 --> 4135.759
reminded why they're doing it in the

4134.88 --> 4139.52
first place

4135.759 --> 4142.08
because they hate

4139.52 --> 4143.1990000000005
the truth because they hate how things

4142.08 --> 4145.2789999999995
really are

4143.199 --> 4146.96
they don't accept it they can't forget

4145.279 --> 4150.319
about it because

4146.96 --> 4153.6
of the delusions they spin around them

4150.319 --> 4156.2390000000005
right it's very weird

4153.6 --> 4158.2390000000005
how the darkness works when somebody

4156.239 --> 4162.4
dives in full

4158.239 --> 4162.4
it's very strange what it does to you

4167.199 --> 4172.4
right when you create a false world to

4170.239 --> 4175.44
attack the real world

4172.4 --> 4177.839
then eventually you start to believe in

4175.44 --> 4180.5599999999995
the lies that you're making

4177.839 --> 4182.48
because you made them because you didn't

4180.56 --> 4183.04
really accept the truth in the first

4182.48 --> 4188.0
place

4183.04 --> 4191.5199999999995
see it's very strange how that works

4188.0 --> 4194.239
that's what happens every single time

4191.52 --> 4194.2390000000005
it's provable

4200.48 --> 4204.5599999999995
like at some point can you even remember

4202.64 --> 4205.04
what the truth is if all that you're

4204.56 --> 4207.4400000000005
doing

4205.04 --> 4209.199
is throwing like trying to condition

4207.44 --> 4210.4
every single individual in the world

4209.199 --> 4212.0
with your lies

4210.4 --> 4213.839999999999
if the lies are the only thing you

4212.0 --> 4216.159
respond with anymore

4213.84 --> 4218.159000000001
then at some point you're gonna you're

4216.159 --> 4220.159
gonna literally forget what the truth

4218.159 --> 4222.5599999999995
was you're gonna forget

4220.159 --> 4224.159
even what spurred the lie and you're

4222.56 --> 4226.0
just gonna believe that's the truth that

4224.159 --> 4230.5599999999995
the lie is the truth see it's

4226.0 --> 4233.199
kind of freaky that's why i used to say

4230.56 --> 4234.719
you make a mistake and you figure out

4233.199 --> 4235.919999999999
that you made a mistake and you don't

4234.719 --> 4239.04
correct that mistake

4235.92 --> 4241.6
then becomes a lie and when you stick to

4239.04 --> 4241.6
that lie

4242.159 --> 4248.5599999999995
then eventually that mistake

4245.6 --> 4250.159000000001
that you could have corrected it becomes

4248.56 --> 4252.88
you

4250.159 --> 4254.08
and then you become the mistake or the

4252.88 --> 4257.28
lie at that point

4254.08 --> 4258.08
right that's not just some mystical

4257.28 --> 4260.48
mumbo jumbo

4258.08 --> 4261.84
when i say that it's literally like the

4260.48 --> 4265.36
spiritual alchemy

4261.84 --> 4266.8
of how that works it literally happens

4265.36 --> 4268.719
like that

4266.8 --> 4271.1990000000005
you start to lie continually then

4268.719 --> 4272.0
eventually you become that lie you

4271.199 --> 4273.759999999999
forget what the

4272.0 --> 4275.84
truth was you start to believe in the

4273.76 --> 4280.08
lie and then it

4275.84 --> 4283.28
influences you it shapes your worldview

4280.08 --> 4285.679
excluding the truthfulness you no longer

4283.28 --> 4288.4
see it at some point if you continue it

4285.679 --> 4289.679
forever you forget you can't see it

4288.4 --> 4292.159
anymore you're blinded

4289.679 --> 4294.64
to the truth because of the lies that

4292.159 --> 4298.08
you chose

4294.64 --> 4298.08
it's fascinating how it works

4298.4 --> 4301.839999999999
it's always shocking if you figure out

4300.56 --> 4306.400000000001
something about yourself

4301.84 --> 4309.92
like that can hurt a lot

4306.4 --> 4312.4
i think that i got

4309.92 --> 4313.52
most of it out because everybody has

4312.4 --> 4316.08
that sort of things like

4313.52 --> 4317.280000000001
little things that you just stick to you

4316.08 --> 4318.96
heard it in your youth and you think

4317.28 --> 4320.239
yeah yeah i'm gonna champion this

4318.96 --> 4322.159
you think you're doing the right thing

4320.239 --> 4323.44
but then later eventually you find out

4322.159 --> 4326.799999999999
wait

4323.44 --> 4326.799999999999
that's not what i thought it was

4327.199 --> 4332.5599999999995
like is this right what i've been

4330.239 --> 4335.28
pursuing

4332.56 --> 4335.84
and then if you're like but i am on such

4335.28 --> 4338.8
a good

4335.84 --> 4339.52
road i am attaining power with what i've

4338.8 --> 4342.64
said

4339.52 --> 4346.88
now if you then choose to continue

4342.64 --> 4350.0
then then it's no longer a mistake

4346.88 --> 4352.4800000000005
then it's a lie see

4350.0 --> 4353.44
it's all about the conscious realization

4352.48 --> 4356.32
of what you're doing

4353.44 --> 4357.12
of any potential mistake once you figure

4356.32 --> 4359.84
it out

4357.12 --> 4361.599999999999
and you double down then you're actually

4359.84 --> 4365.28
lying then you are committing

4361.6 --> 4371.84
a spiritual sin effectively and that

4365.28 --> 4371.84
will alter you

4371.92 --> 4375.6
it's weird auto works but it is it works

4374.8 --> 4385.84
like this

4375.6 --> 4385.84
it really does

4387.41 --> 4395.599999999999
[Music]

4391.28 --> 4395.599999999999
once you learn all you don't come back

4396.4 --> 4400.799999999999
well look a lot look you can be

4399.679 --> 4403.76
confronted with like

4400.8 --> 4405.52
all the figured out truths of like a 60

4403.76 --> 4407.52
year old man or something that's

4405.52 --> 4409.360000000001
literally spent his entire life trying

4407.52 --> 4410.96
to figure out the truth and sifting

4409.36 --> 4411.5199999999995
through it all being the wisest and all

4410.96 --> 4413.6
that

4411.52 --> 4415.120000000001
or if you pour that on to like a really

4413.6 --> 4417.360000000001
young kid

4415.12 --> 4418.32
they're not gonna take it because it's

4417.36 --> 4420.4
too much

4418.32 --> 4422.639999999999
it'll literally feel like they're being

4420.4 --> 4424.32
stripped of their own intellectual

4422.64 --> 4426.0
development when that happens i've

4424.32 --> 4428.96
experienced that myself

4426.0 --> 4430.719
so they will only take out a few things

4428.96 --> 4432.56
of what is said and then start playing

4430.719 --> 4433.84
with that and forget the rest forget the

4432.56 --> 4435.84
wider implications

4433.84 --> 4437.52
because they can't handle it they're not

4435.84 --> 4440.0
ready to attain

4437.52 --> 4440.8
that level of insight yet they're not

4440.0 --> 4443.44
ready

4440.8 --> 4443.4400000000005
takes time

4446.159 --> 4450.4
it's not because they're lying it's

4448.56 --> 4452.400000000001
because they literally just can't handle

4450.4 --> 4455.12
it

4452.4 --> 4457.36
can carry the spiritual weight that

4455.12 --> 4460.64
comes with that they're not ready for it

4457.36 --> 4461.759999999999
they haven't grown to that level yet to

4460.64 --> 4469.84
be able to wield it

4461.76 --> 4469.84
that's how it works

4472.08 --> 4474.48
right

4476.32 --> 4483.84
hey julio pevin

4485.67 --> 4488.85
[Music]

4494.84 --> 4499.84
hmm

4496.4 --> 4499.839999999999
surrounded by masons eh

4508.84 --> 4511.84
hmm

4516.8 --> 4522.64
all right jahawashi our son

4520.64 --> 4524.56
kind of like the name jesus with the

4522.64 --> 4529.6
letter j only we've invented

4524.56 --> 4529.6
500 years ago yeah sure

4529.92 --> 4533.1990000000005
but i don't know it all depends on how

4532.8 --> 4536.320000000001
much

4533.199 --> 4538.799999999999
weight you put on

4536.32 --> 4540.159
exoterics like that like does it really

4538.8 --> 4542.320000000001
matter

4540.159 --> 4544.639999999999
how you pronounce the name or how you

4542.32 --> 4546.159
write it is there some kind of magical

4544.64 --> 4549.04
specific quality

4546.159 --> 4549.679
like you write down the name exactly

4549.04 --> 4552.239
correct

4549.679 --> 4553.4400000000005
and you you put down this secret extra

4552.239 --> 4555.199
dot

4553.44 --> 4557.199
that nobody understands that's supposed

4555.199 --> 4558.239
to be there in a very specific place

4557.199 --> 4560.879999999999
right and then

4558.239 --> 4562.32
then the gates of heaven opened oh i

4560.88 --> 4566.96
don't believe in that

4562.32 --> 4568.799999999999
i'm sorry i'm an as a terrorist

4566.96 --> 4570.88
the only thing relevant to me about

4568.8 --> 4574.159000000001
jesus

4570.88 --> 4576.8
is what he did

4574.159 --> 4578.839999999999
how he lived and the wisdom that he

4576.8 --> 4582.719
tried to convey to a world

4578.84 --> 4586.64
that is never ready

4582.719 --> 4589.44
until it is as an individual the path

4586.64 --> 4591.52
what he did how he did it the intention

4589.44 --> 4594.879999999999
behind it

4591.52 --> 4597.52
the con the philosophy behind it

4594.88 --> 4598.400000000001
and the principles the methods that he

4597.52 --> 4600.2390000000005
applied

4598.4 --> 4602.0
i don't really care how his name is

4600.239 --> 4602.5599999999995
written how is that relevant to anything

4602.0 --> 4605.76
how do you

4602.56 --> 4608.64
learn about that how do you grow

4605.76 --> 4610.2390000000005
from being very specific and you're

4608.64 --> 4611.1990000000005
right how you write down the name you

4610.239 --> 4613.12
see

4611.199 --> 4614.96
now you might be offended that i'm

4613.12 --> 4616.64
saying that maybe there probably are

4614.96 --> 4618.4800000000005
some people that hold a lot of weight on

4616.64 --> 4621.04
this but i don't really

4618.48 --> 4623.199
and i'm sorry if that offends you i do

4621.04 --> 4626.96
not mean to blaspheme

4623.199 --> 4630.879999999999
right but i personally just

4626.96 --> 4633.44
don't have that much weight on how you

4630.88 --> 4634.56
pronounce or write down the name i've

4633.44 --> 4638.639999999999
just learned him as

4634.56 --> 4638.64
jesus jesus christ

4638.8 --> 4642.56
i'm keeping it kind of basic that way

4640.719 --> 4645.6
and i know it's written

4642.56 --> 4646.96
it's passed around in books that are

4645.6 --> 4649.120000000001
also involved the

4646.96 --> 4650.0
jesuits and all that i know it's all so

4649.12 --> 4651.84
troublesome

4650.0 --> 4653.28
and that's why i've kind of discarded

4651.84 --> 4655.84
the exeteric approach

4653.28 --> 4657.84
entirely and just go by the essence of

4655.84 --> 4660.4800000000005
things

4657.84 --> 4662.159000000001
and in the book there are some things

4660.48 --> 4663.36
that are very dubious

4662.159 --> 4666.159
and then there are some things that are

4663.36 --> 4666.719
very good and what is most important to

4666.159 --> 4672.159
me

4666.719 --> 4675.76
is that i can distinguish between them

4672.159 --> 4676.48
and then decide this is good i'll try to

4675.76 --> 4679.360000000001
do that

4676.48 --> 4680.08
or in that direction that spirit that is

4679.36 --> 4681.839999999999
bad

4680.08 --> 4684.0
when i confront it with something like

4681.84 --> 4686.400000000001
that i will reject it or i will

4684.0 --> 4690.0
criticize it i will be wise about it

4686.4 --> 4693.36
but it will definitely not approve that

4690.0 --> 4706.56
you see and that's

4693.36 --> 4709.839999999999
how i do these things so

4706.56 --> 4712.56
uh [ __ ] wazzle i think that's you

4709.84 --> 4713.679
like even for me now the stream seems

4712.56 --> 4717.120000000001
pretty fluid

4713.679 --> 4718.84
so i know maybe refresh sometimes it

4717.12 --> 4721.84
helps sometimes you have to restart your

4718.84 --> 4721.84
browser

4725.199 --> 4727.759999999999
julio

4729.199 --> 4736.4
oh i never thought about that

4733.04 --> 4736.719
julia i am so used to just calling you

4736.4 --> 4739.839999999999
you

4736.719 --> 4739.84
julio i guess that

4741.04 --> 4746.32
is pronounced in a more hispanic way

4743.84 --> 4746.32
julio

4750.159 --> 4753.599999999999
it's going to be difficult i really got

4751.679 --> 4755.76
used to just calling you giulio i hope

4753.6 --> 4758.8
it you don't mind

4755.76 --> 4763.84
i'll try to adapt

4758.8 --> 4763.84
i never even asked silly me

4776.239 --> 4780.48
they say death was a concept introduced

4778.64 --> 4783.76
in humans do you agree or when

4780.48 --> 4784.959999999999
why don't we live at 10 000 years well

4783.76 --> 4789.04
how could you live 10

4784.96 --> 4789.04
000 years in world like it is now

4789.679 --> 4794.56
but i think that humans could probably

4793.12 --> 4797.28
live a lot longer

4794.56 --> 4797.679
if eugenicists weren't trying to destroy

4797.28 --> 4800.5599999999995
them

4797.679 --> 4802.4
every step of the way with everything

4800.56 --> 4805.04
their environment with their food with

4802.4 --> 4806.96
their psychology

4805.04 --> 4808.719
with their culture everything they can

4806.96 --> 4812.4
they try to introduce

4808.719 --> 4814.8
death or degeneration or hopelessness

4812.4 --> 4816.879999999999
demoralization in some kind of way and

4814.8 --> 4821.52
that all contributes

4816.88 --> 4821.52
to quicker death i agree

4825.84 --> 4833.84
yeah but i definitely know that how to

4827.76 --> 4833.84
pronounce that

4836.96 --> 4847.84
keep it the same alright thank you

4857.199 --> 4863.44
yeah ah digging back are we

4861.199 --> 4865.919999999999
maybe the world was more oxygen rich

4863.44 --> 4868.4
because of the giant trees

4865.92 --> 4868.4
who knows

4871.679 --> 4876.88
could be you know

4874.719 --> 4879.44
it's conceivable that if there was just

4876.88 --> 4880.4800000000005
more gas pressure and like more oxygen

4879.44 --> 4883.599999999999
rich

4880.48 --> 4886.839999999999
gas pressure that everything would

4883.6 --> 4889.84
be more healthy would potentially grow

4886.84 --> 4889.84
bigger

4905.199 --> 4910.96
right yeah terra 306 it

4908.4 --> 4913.759999999999
it's interesting because there's like

4910.96 --> 4917.52
this weird conundrum going on right

4913.76 --> 4921.1990000000005
on on all sides so poor people

4917.52 --> 4921.1990000000005
are basically subjected to

4921.44 --> 4924.48
the most poison [ __ ] the most delusion

4924.159 --> 4927.04
they

4924.48 --> 4928.879999999999
they try to get fooled in like yeah

4927.04 --> 4932.8
accidentally ending themselves

4928.88 --> 4935.04
the most now the super rich people

4932.8 --> 4937.360000000001
they got everything conceivable they

4935.04 --> 4940.0
could buy anything any cure

4937.36 --> 4942.159
they could literally just buy a

4940.0 --> 4944.0
laboratory and then make a cure with

4942.159 --> 4946.96
that laboratory by their own design

4944.0 --> 4950.08
if they wanted to right but you see

4946.96 --> 4953.52
that's not going to make them immortal

4950.08 --> 4956.5599999999995
why because

4953.52 --> 4961.4400000000005
they are all mentally deranged and

4956.56 --> 4964.159000000001
full of sin and guess what sin

4961.44 --> 4965.199
also is poison and it's not a poison you

4964.159 --> 4969.44
can neutralize

4965.199 --> 4972.5599999999995
unless you stop doing it huh

4969.44 --> 4976.159
so the sin will actually degenerate them

4972.56 --> 4978.400000000001
they got all the the food and all the

4976.159 --> 4979.92
things medical things they can buy it's

4978.4 --> 4982.08
just not going to help really

4979.92 --> 4983.84
yeah it might on the short term cure

4982.08 --> 4985.28
things that other people might be

4983.84 --> 4987.28
burdened with for years

4985.28 --> 4989.599999999999
because they can't pay for anything to

4987.28 --> 4992.5599999999995
do with anything about it

4989.6 --> 4993.92
but they're really super rich they got

4992.56 --> 4996.719
constant sin

4993.92 --> 4998.56
constant sin permanent it's tied into

4996.719 --> 5000.8
their being so that punished them

4998.56 --> 5002.0
over time degenerates them over time

5000.8 --> 5005.360000000001
that's god's punishment

5002.0 --> 5008.8
it's like no you can't you can't escape

5005.36 --> 5010.639
you can't they hate it but it is what it

5008.8 --> 5011.92
is and they often double down on it

5010.639 --> 5014.96
making it worse

5011.92 --> 5018.639
causing more punishment feedback

5014.96 --> 5020.4
from the creator from their sins right

5018.639 --> 5022.4800000000005
and at the same time yeah those poor

5020.4 --> 5025.5199999999995
people they eat

5022.48 --> 5027.599999999999
crappy food sometimes but hey if their

5025.52 --> 5028.0
morale is great if they're actually

5027.6 --> 5030.0
really

5028.0 --> 5031.36
good people and they take care of

5030.0 --> 5034.639
everybody and they're always

5031.36 --> 5036.799999999999
trying to help everybody then

5034.639 --> 5038.400000000001
you might be surprised that they might

5036.8 --> 5041.4400000000005
actually turn out to live

5038.4 --> 5043.599999999999
longer than some of these rich people

5041.44 --> 5045.36
that have everything available to them

5043.6 --> 5046.96
because these poor people they're not

5045.36 --> 5048.719
ever going to be demoralized to the

5046.96 --> 5050.2390000000005
point where they will literally consider

5048.719 --> 5054.2390000000005
killing themselves

5050.239 --> 5056.4
because they're loved and they do good

5054.239 --> 5057.839999999999
and they feel good because of it and god

5056.4 --> 5061.28
helps them

5057.84 --> 5064.639
and infuses their spirit with hope

5061.28 --> 5067.679
and regeneration power with healing

5064.639 --> 5069.52
just divine healing

5067.679 --> 5070.88
even though they might not be eating a

5069.52 --> 5073.92
lot

5070.88 --> 5078.08
or they have really shitty clothes

5073.92 --> 5081.04
or they yeah they don't even have a bike

5078.08 --> 5082.88
if they live with god morally and they

5081.04 --> 5084.48
do the right thing they follow the path

5082.88 --> 5086.88
of christ for example even though they

5084.48 --> 5090.5599999999995
don't necessarily even have to know

5086.88 --> 5093.84
the bible or christ exists if they just

5090.56 --> 5098.159000000001
follow the pattern they just do it right

5093.84 --> 5101.84
then they will be longer living

5098.159 --> 5102.5599999999995
than the rich people this is so this is

5101.84 --> 5105.52
kind of like

5102.56 --> 5106.2390000000005
kind of overlooked a little sometimes

5105.52 --> 5108.4800000000005
but yeah

5106.239 --> 5109.44
then again poor people also they're

5108.48 --> 5111.599999999999
they're also

5109.44 --> 5113.44
facing for the same trials as everybody

5111.6 --> 5114.96
else does and there's no guarantee that

5113.44 --> 5117.04
because you're poor you're also

5114.96 --> 5119.84
automatically going to be a good person

5117.04 --> 5122.4
you might turn into a complete demonic

5119.84 --> 5124.84
scammer that's just like i have to rob

5122.4 --> 5127.5199999999995
everything just to

5124.84 --> 5129.92
whatever

5127.52 --> 5131.4400000000005
get one specific drug or something to

5129.92 --> 5133.6
just forget about it all right

5131.44 --> 5135.199
that sort of thing then they will just

5133.6 --> 5139.120000000001
be

5135.199 --> 5141.04
yeah then they want to get the blessing

5139.12 --> 5142.32
and they'll just screw up their lives

5141.04 --> 5145.6
and everybody else's

5142.32 --> 5145.599999999999
just like the rich people

5152.84 --> 5155.84
right

5158.639 --> 5163.1990000000005
yeah well it depends on the region guns

5160.56 --> 5166.8
have never unlocked homeless people

5163.199 --> 5166.799999999999
but it kind of depends though you know

5166.84 --> 5170.159000000001
because

5168.159 --> 5171.679
there there could also be homeless

5170.159 --> 5173.759999999999
people that you just don't know are

5171.679 --> 5174.4
homeless they will figure out a way to

5173.76 --> 5176.88
get by

5174.4 --> 5178.4
they will know the right people and they

5176.88 --> 5179.04
will be good people and they will be

5178.4 --> 5181.679
welcomed

5179.04 --> 5182.08
even though they might not have a home

5181.679 --> 5185.4400000000005
but

5182.08 --> 5187.6
yeah if you're completely lost and a

5185.44 --> 5189.599999999999
total drug addict and you can barely

5187.6 --> 5191.04
think anymore yeah it's very easy to

5189.6 --> 5192.719
pluck you off the street in certain

5191.04 --> 5196.48
regions and then

5192.719 --> 5200.2390000000005
yeah disgusting [ __ ] might happen i know

5196.48 --> 5200.239
but it depends kind of on the region

5206.0 --> 5210.239
the more truer flat earth i become the

5208.639 --> 5212.96
more resistance i get from

5210.239 --> 5214.718999999999
people who don't even know me properly

5212.96 --> 5216.08
right well that depends on how open

5214.719 --> 5216.88
you're going to be with the sheeple you

5216.08 --> 5221.5199999999995
know

5216.88 --> 5224.639
because sheeple don't communicate

5221.52 --> 5226.96
openly as much as we

5224.639 --> 5229.36
learn to do so if you're just going to

5226.96 --> 5231.04
throw out the raw truth as you just

5229.36 --> 5232.48
figure it out yeah it's literally going

5231.04 --> 5233.44
to just hurt them it's going to offend

5232.48 --> 5234.718999999999
them of course they're going to get

5233.44 --> 5236.719
triggered you got to be careful with

5234.719 --> 5239.84
that

5236.719 --> 5240.56
you know when you approach cheap you

5239.84 --> 5242.88
don't go

5240.56 --> 5244.56
hey sheep ha ha this is awesome look at

5242.88 --> 5247.4400000000005
this they're all going to run away

5244.56 --> 5249.280000000001
yeah that's sheep sheep run away when

5247.44 --> 5250.719
you're too intense you're going to be

5249.28 --> 5253.36
careful you're going to kind of get to

5250.719 --> 5254.2390000000005
their level or they're just gonna get

5253.36 --> 5266.71
scared

5254.239 --> 5270.759999999999
and run away

5266.71 --> 5270.76
[Music]

5274.48 --> 5281.839999999999
yeah it certainly does change everything

5277.199 --> 5281.839999999999
guns have never run rmp

5293.28 --> 5295.84
hmm

5297.52 --> 5302.0
all right terror 306. yeah you could do

5300.08 --> 5304.96
that

5302.0 --> 5306.239
you got to realize that i i'm not sure

5304.96 --> 5309.28
it depends on the region

5306.239 --> 5313.759999999999
maybe you're in india right

5309.28 --> 5316.159
so it depends on the region but like

5313.76 --> 5318.08
the world's being bombarded with that

5316.159 --> 5318.638999999999
like a lot of people are talking about

5318.08 --> 5321.199
that now

5318.639 --> 5322.08
like even not that awake just people

5321.199 --> 5324.5599999999995
knows like

5322.08 --> 5326.0
this is wrong this is wrong this why is

5324.56 --> 5330.159000000001
this mainstream just

5326.0 --> 5332.88
putting out these blatantly wrong facts

5330.159 --> 5333.92
so even if you don't like to know about

5332.88 --> 5335.679
911 or

5333.92 --> 5336.96
anything or the moon landing or flat

5335.679 --> 5337.92
earth or any you don't want to know

5336.96 --> 5339.84
anything about it

5337.92 --> 5341.12
there's still a lot of these people that

5339.84 --> 5342.32
don't want to have anything to do with

5341.12 --> 5342.639
it they're still going to figure out

5342.32 --> 5344.5599999999995
like

5342.639 --> 5347.76
this is just wrong and they're going to

5344.56 --> 5347.76
try to talk about it

5348.84 --> 5354.4800000000005
so

5350.56 --> 5356.88
right but again it depends on the region

5354.48 --> 5362.0
and how exposed they are to

5356.88 --> 5362.0
for say the internet how much media they

5362.84 --> 5365.84
got

5371.12 --> 5375.44
right yeah here we go again i know it's

5376.88 --> 5381.92
it's still a concept though the the

5379.44 --> 5384.638999999999
actual proof

5381.92 --> 5385.52
that is missing but i really like the

5384.639 --> 5388.8
idea though i

5385.52 --> 5390.719
i am i am thinking in the same direction

5388.8 --> 5391.360000000001
for like the age of wonders which is

5390.719 --> 5394.8
like

5391.36 --> 5397.5199999999995
the pre-atlantean age when yeah

5394.8 --> 5399.679
i like that no trees it kind of spurred

5397.52 --> 5401.1990000000005
me to get inspired and really try to

5399.679 --> 5404.88
figure out the ages

5401.199 --> 5407.919999999999
of all of all earth

5404.88 --> 5410.159000000001
in a in any kind of fantastical way that

5407.92 --> 5414.0
in my vision would coincide

5410.159 --> 5417.5199999999995
with genesis it would just

5414.0 --> 5420.0
like fill in other things

5417.52 --> 5420.96
where there are in my few blanks and i

5420.0 --> 5423.76
don't know it was

5420.96 --> 5423.76
just an attempt

5425.76 --> 5429.280000000001
so i always thought that the no tree is

5428.32 --> 5431.5199999999995
on blood earth

5429.28 --> 5432.4
whatever no trees were interest of there

5431.52 --> 5434.88
no forest

5432.4 --> 5435.839999999999
whatever i thought it was a very

5434.88 --> 5438.4800000000005
interesting

5435.84 --> 5441.52
inspiring concept but i'm not saying

5438.48 --> 5444.159
that it's absolutely true

5441.52 --> 5445.120000000001
but there is like come on guys the earth

5444.159 --> 5448.48
is pretty

5445.12 --> 5451.36
freaky mysterious like really

5448.48 --> 5453.5199999999995
like it's really weird how it all works

5451.36 --> 5455.679
what is actually transpiring with just

5453.52 --> 5457.280000000001
like mountains for example

5455.679 --> 5459.12
there's mountains out there that

5457.28 --> 5463.12
literally

5459.12 --> 5466.159
like roots suck water

5463.12 --> 5470.08
up and then

5466.159 --> 5471.92
like yeah through the mountain it sucks

5470.08 --> 5475.92
water up and then

5471.92 --> 5480.56
kind of it ends up on top it's so weird

5475.92 --> 5480.56
this earth is so freaky weird sometimes

5489.36 --> 5491.839999999999
all right

5501.28 --> 5506.96
yeah twin wheel shield that's cute

5503.28 --> 5506.96
that's cute just call me arwin

5516.8 --> 5520.8
any trees wipe that all together at some

5518.8 --> 5526.08
point much cold

5520.8 --> 5526.08
perhaps but look the no trees

5526.719 --> 5533.44
it does kind of suggest like like

5529.92 --> 5535.4400000000005
really insanely colossal

5533.44 --> 5538.5599999999995
trees you know and like what is it even

5535.44 --> 5540.719
is it like stone or anything or

5538.56 --> 5542.2390000000005
were they silicon or is it actual wood

5540.719 --> 5544.84
well if it was actual wood that would be

5542.239 --> 5546.5599999999995
such an insane amount of wood that's

5544.84 --> 5550.56
just

5546.56 --> 5551.4400000000005
the ridiculous like where are the

5550.56 --> 5555.04
freaking

5551.44 --> 5559.28
dents of the trees falling over

5555.04 --> 5559.28
where are the giant dents like the

5559.36 --> 5564.799999999999
mile thick print of a tree

5562.639 --> 5566.2390000000005
falling down falling over you know that

5564.8 --> 5569.28
those things

5566.239 --> 5571.12
i don't see any of that so see

5569.28 --> 5573.36
it's it's complicated there's no

5571.12 --> 5575.92
guarantee that it was actually literal

5573.36 --> 5578.96
it's just a really fascinating idea

5575.92 --> 5582.88
and it does also just give you make you

5578.96 --> 5586.08
look again at how mysterious

5582.88 --> 5588.639
the workings of terra

5586.08 --> 5589.84
of the world of just the rocks alone on

5588.639 --> 5592.159000000001
this world are

5589.84 --> 5593.52
it's really mysterious and it's more

5592.159 --> 5598.239
complicated than

5593.52 --> 5598.2390000000005
on the surface it might seem so

5598.32 --> 5605.5199999999995
yes petrification can happen very fast

5602.159 --> 5609.44
but look a

5605.52 --> 5613.1990000000005
tree that is literally

5609.44 --> 5615.28
10 miles across thickness right

5613.199 --> 5617.12
that's not just gonna petrify all the

5615.28 --> 5621.199
way through very quickly

5617.12 --> 5624.639
right we can petrify things

5621.199 --> 5628.159
like a shoe

5624.639 --> 5631.76
relatively quickly but yeah

5628.159 --> 5633.36
a 10 mile thick thing

5631.76 --> 5635.280000000001
right that's that's not just going to

5633.36 --> 5638.48
petrify in a few days

5635.28 --> 5640.0
did that no no no that i don't believe

5638.48 --> 5641.839999999999
that could work

5640.0 --> 5643.04
right so there's complications with the

5641.84 --> 5645.84
whole concept

5643.04 --> 5649.04
it's it's it's very convoluted but it

5645.84 --> 5649.04
was an interesting idea

5655.84 --> 5660.8
are we all things following his script

5657.679 --> 5660.8
yes i believe we are

5663.44 --> 5667.04
we are as designed i think that even our

5665.92 --> 5669.76
very consciousness

5667.04 --> 5671.36
itself was basically part of the

5669.76 --> 5673.360000000001
original design

5671.36 --> 5675.599999999999
that the process of our consciousness is

5673.36 --> 5679.679
just another cog in the whole thing

5675.6 --> 5682.4800000000005
as designed and we just

5679.679 --> 5683.1990000000005
can choose to believe that we are

5682.48 --> 5686.159
separate

5683.199 --> 5689.678999999999
or that we are just a fluent part of the

5686.159 --> 5689.679
design and that was the choice

5689.84 --> 5693.4400000000005
but everything is accounted for like

5692.239 --> 5697.44
even the choice

5693.44 --> 5698.96
not to be real is accounted for in the

5697.44 --> 5702.159
design of it all

5698.96 --> 5704.159
so yeah at that i believe there's free

5702.159 --> 5707.599999999999
will

5704.159 --> 5710.96
but that free will is not the

5707.6 --> 5714.719
end all of creation it's still just

5710.96 --> 5718.2390000000005
what we deal with within

5714.719 --> 5720.96
our lesser consciousness

5718.239 --> 5722.718999999999
in relation to the designer who is

5720.96 --> 5726.08
absolute

5722.719 --> 5729.44
right that's how i see it now if you

5726.08 --> 5730.239
realize that you could just follow your

5729.44 --> 5733.119
design

5730.239 --> 5734.799999999999
and do as basically goddess yeah

5733.119 --> 5736.5599999999995
predicated

5734.8 --> 5738.96
then yeah there will be benefits there

5736.56 --> 5742.2390000000005
will be things you miss out on

5738.96 --> 5744.4
but that won't matter now if you don't

5742.239 --> 5746.4
if you choose all to ignore all of that

5744.4 --> 5748.799999999999
then there's the opposite side

5746.4 --> 5750.799999999999
but it's all part of the whole design

5748.8 --> 5751.52
all of it is there's no escape from the

5750.8 --> 5753.4400000000005
design

5751.52 --> 5755.040000000001
whether you believe in it whether you

5753.44 --> 5757.759999999999
believe in absolute lies

5755.04 --> 5760.719
or you believe in absolute truth how do

5757.76 --> 5763.76
you even determine that right

5760.719 --> 5766.4
it's all part of it all of it

5763.76 --> 5766.400000000001
everything is

5767.04 --> 5771.84
that's how i see it

5776.08 --> 5779.6
i discharge of electricity can turn wood

5778.639 --> 5783.52
into stone that's

5779.6 --> 5786.639
interesting look random i'm not

5783.52 --> 5789.119000000001
excluding it

5786.639 --> 5790.719
entirely i'm just saying it seems a

5789.119 --> 5794.159
little convoluted to me

5790.719 --> 5794.159
and the little extreme

5794.96 --> 5798.32
it's an interesting idea i'm just not

5797.52 --> 5801.4400000000005
100

5798.32 --> 5803.84
convinced but it does give a lot of

5801.44 --> 5804.879999999999
leads to mysteries in this world and

5803.84 --> 5808.0
that is

5804.88 --> 5810.4800000000005
what i really liked about it it made you

5808.0 --> 5814.8
look it made you think

5810.48 --> 5816.799999999999
i'm not i'm not gonna buy any concept

5814.8 --> 5819.92
totally like i'm not gonna say this is

5816.8 --> 5823.92
absolutely true because i don't know

5819.92 --> 5823.92
i don't know wasn't there

5824.159 --> 5827.839999999999
but i can think about it

5838.88 --> 5842.0
filled into accommodate humans yes yes

5841.199 --> 5843.839999999999
oh well i

5842.0 --> 5845.04
definitely this is another thing that's

5843.84 --> 5847.4400000000005
kind of separate but i

5845.04 --> 5848.88
definitely do believe there were giants

5847.44 --> 5851.759999999999
absolutely

5848.88 --> 5853.36
and the bible also supports this a lot

5851.76 --> 5855.679
of things support this and then

5853.36 --> 5858.32
definitely think they were

5855.679 --> 5860.4
giants i think there might still be

5858.32 --> 5862.4
giants

5860.4 --> 5866.159
that are like or half giants they're not

5862.4 --> 5869.28
gonna be as large as the giants of old

5866.159 --> 5872.719
right so that is one thing that i have

5869.28 --> 5876.159
much more yeah i have

5872.719 --> 5880.08
much less doubt about that giants

5876.159 --> 5884.08
yeah i'm pretty willing to say just yep

5880.08 --> 5884.08
with that i believe that

5884.96 --> 5892.2390000000005
i've yet to in person see one

5888.96 --> 5894.2390000000005
but there's just too much

5892.239 --> 5897.199
too much pointing at that there are

5894.239 --> 5899.44
giants and historically and

5897.199 --> 5902.96
the smithsonian throwing giant bones

5899.44 --> 5905.5199999999995
into the into the ocean and like history

5902.96 --> 5906.719
right goliath two is it's all over the

5905.52 --> 5909.280000000001
place so yeah

5906.719 --> 5910.639
giants i've made giants even an integral

5909.28 --> 5913.679
part of my

5910.639 --> 5916.08
of how i envisioned the atlantean age

5913.679 --> 5917.4400000000005
with the concept of building pyramids

5916.08 --> 5919.5199999999995
how they did that

5917.44 --> 5921.119
that they used giants and that giants

5919.52 --> 5923.92
then proceeded to feed

5921.119 --> 5926.32
of the electric energy output of the

5923.92 --> 5930.2390000000005
pyramids it was like a symbiotic

5926.32 --> 5932.32
system the giants and the pyramids

5930.239 --> 5935.44
that's a conception that i've brought

5932.32 --> 5939.199
forward a couple of years ago

5935.44 --> 5942.159
i believe in giants absolutely i do

5939.199 --> 5942.96
but that no trees i don't know it look

5942.159 --> 5946.159
it could be

5942.96 --> 5949.04
it's just it's a little too big for me

5946.159 --> 5951.28
it's too far away it's too much it's too

5949.04 --> 5953.92
complicated

5951.28 --> 5954.96
not excluding it entirely i'm just

5953.92 --> 5958.4
saying like i

5954.96 --> 5958.4
i can't just say yeah

5958.639 --> 5964.56
pyramid i mean pyramids

5965.199 --> 5974.4
or as they say or as i would

5969.199 --> 5974.4
say it hydroelectric

5975.4 --> 5983.119
hydroelectrostatic generators

5980.32 --> 5984.32
like you rock formations water running

5983.119 --> 5986.48
under them the rock

5984.32 --> 5988.48
collecting the tension and then by its

5986.48 --> 5988.959999999999
design outputting it almost like a

5988.48 --> 5991.759999999999
passive

5988.96 --> 5994.08
tesla coil creating a high tension

5991.76 --> 5996.400000000001
electrical field that literally feeds

5994.08 --> 5998.0
and purifies all forms of life in the

5996.4 --> 6009.839999999999
surrounding

5998.0 --> 6009.84
that that's what i believe

6011.44 --> 6017.44
you seem cynical to the one realtor what

6014.639 --> 6020.96
the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

6017.44 --> 6022.719
how the hell did you take that out of

6020.96 --> 6025.04
everything i've said

6022.719 --> 6027.679
that's ridiculous you're slandering me

6025.04 --> 6030.8
right now are you one of tony's

6027.679 --> 6032.2390000000005
this is absolutely sad that you would

6030.8 --> 6036.56
state such a

6032.239 --> 6039.04
shitty remark like if anything i believe

6036.56 --> 6039.92
absolutely in the true creator of

6039.04 --> 6041.92
everything i

6039.92 --> 6044.4
i literally just explained that did you

6041.92 --> 6047.119
were you not paying attention there

6044.4 --> 6048.159
are you here to troll me because i'm

6047.119 --> 6051.759999999999
just gonna ban you

6048.159 --> 6065.799999999999
just warning you right

6051.76 --> 6069.4490000000005
you insult me sir i don't accept that

6065.8 --> 6069.4490000000005
[Music]

6077.28 --> 6085.5199999999995
what's the evidence of giants oh

6080.48 --> 6085.5199999999995
giant graves giant doorways

6086.159 --> 6092.719
giant constructions that man still

6089.52 --> 6095.040000000001
cannot reproduce to this day

6092.719 --> 6095.04
uh

6096.0 --> 6102.159
historical recollections

6099.44 --> 6102.719
testimony written down about meeting

6102.159 --> 6105.5199999999995
giants

6102.719 --> 6107.6
giant tribes that in america for example

6105.52 --> 6111.84
the giant red-haired

6107.6 --> 6114.639
tribe uh giants in afghanistan

6111.84 --> 6117.28
it was said that in afghanistan even

6114.639 --> 6117.28
what is it the

6117.52 --> 6122.080000000001
2001 2002 when that happened they met

6120.48 --> 6124.08
giants and killed one

6122.08 --> 6125.92
like giant suddenly came walking up to

6124.08 --> 6127.04
them they scared the [ __ ] out and they

6125.92 --> 6131.28
shot it

6127.04 --> 6133.92
like a three meter tall humanoid so yeah

6131.28 --> 6136.08
lots and lots of data on giants lots of

6133.92 --> 6136.08
it

6141.52 --> 6145.76
right and that's just that's just what i

6144.239 --> 6148.4
just

6145.76 --> 6149.92
from easy memory picked out because

6148.4 --> 6152.48
there's just

6149.92 --> 6153.679
innumerable proofs of giants it's just

6152.48 --> 6155.599999999999
unbelievable

6153.679 --> 6158.2390000000005
everywhere everywhere in the world

6155.6 --> 6158.2390000000005
everywhere

6160.84 --> 6165.52
so

6163.679 --> 6167.36
yeah here we go again that's the one

6165.52 --> 6176.4800000000005
that i remember the most

6167.36 --> 6178.5599999999995
there's a lot of it

6176.48 --> 6180.879999999999
okay guns i've never run do you think

6178.56 --> 6182.639
there was free energy a few hundred

6180.88 --> 6185.119
years

6182.639 --> 6186.0
or sooner so many sprites and lightning

6185.119 --> 6188.0
rods

6186.0 --> 6191.04
well i think that tertaria definitely

6188.0 --> 6193.84
had electrical

6191.04 --> 6195.84
free energy that they utilized

6193.84 --> 6204.0
constantly yes

6195.84 --> 6206.4800000000005
and that's not too long ago

6204.0 --> 6208.08
so i think there's been several periods

6206.48 --> 6210.718999999999
in human history where that has been

6208.08 --> 6210.719
utilized

6211.679 --> 6218.2390000000005
i think that the atlantean age

6215.119 --> 6221.04
pre-flood was

6218.239 --> 6222.5599999999995
probably the yeah where they perfected

6221.04 --> 6224.639
it

6222.56 --> 6226.080000000001
and then after the flood like humans

6224.639 --> 6228.4800000000005
rebuild up and then

6226.08 --> 6231.199
i don't know maybe like the romans and

6228.48 --> 6232.879999999999
the egyptians were also kind of using it

6231.199 --> 6235.04
but more secretly and then later

6232.88 --> 6238.2390000000005
territory has like really started to

6235.04 --> 6238.239
just overtly use it

6238.48 --> 6247.839999999999
so yeah

6258.84 --> 6261.84
so

6264.48 --> 6271.04
if giants exists gravity and they

6267.76 --> 6275.84
add gravity add they teach us

6271.04 --> 6275.84
will be demon what

6278.4 --> 6280.879999999999
what's that

6282.32 --> 6289.84
if giants exists gravity's debunked why

6284.88 --> 6289.84
why would it

6291.679 --> 6296.4
i don't see the relevance there's very

6294.96 --> 6299.679
big animals too

6296.4 --> 6302.0
doesn't debunk gravity it like gravity

6299.679 --> 6305.28
bunks itself by not really having an

6302.0 --> 6307.6
empirical claim it's just a story

6305.28 --> 6308.8
a relative density can work with very

6307.6 --> 6311.92
big creatures

6308.8 --> 6313.6
it's no problem but yeah big creatures

6311.92 --> 6314.96
will have big issues of course because

6313.6 --> 6317.119000000001
they have a lot of

6314.96 --> 6318.2390000000005
a lot of mass you could say or a lot of

6317.119 --> 6320.48
weight

6318.239 --> 6321.599999999999
and if they don't have proper structural

6320.48 --> 6323.919999999999
support for that

6321.6 --> 6323.92
then

6329.44 --> 6333.199
oh okay well get the [ __ ] out then you

6332.159 --> 6335.28
don't like it

6333.199 --> 6337.28
after you freaking slander me for no

6335.28 --> 6339.92
damn reason

6337.28 --> 6339.92
scumbag

6340.88 --> 6344.96
yeah telling me i'm not believing the

6343.44 --> 6348.719
true creator who the [ __ ] do you think

6344.96 --> 6348.719
you are scumbag get the [ __ ] out

6350.88 --> 6355.36
go back to your little squirter circle

6353.84 --> 6359.84
your devil persecutor

6355.36 --> 6359.839999999999
family whatever that's supposed to be

6360.8 --> 6363.119000000001
right

6364.32 --> 6369.199
but anyway as i was saying yeah they

6366.96 --> 6370.4800000000005
will have to have the proper structural

6369.199 --> 6372.239
support in order to

6370.48 --> 6374.4
be that big is always the issue with

6372.239 --> 6376.718999999999
large creatures like even in nature

6374.4 --> 6378.879999999999
when they grow a certain size they get

6376.719 --> 6381.76
trouble with their joints

6378.88 --> 6383.119
the structural support can't hold their

6381.76 --> 6384.84
giant weight anymore now

6383.119 --> 6387.04
they can still use their weight to

6384.84 --> 6389.1990000000005
impose to dominate

6387.04 --> 6390.4
others of their kind but they will at

6389.199 --> 6392.799999999999
the same time

6390.4 --> 6394.0
despite despite this more psychological

6392.8 --> 6396.400000000001
influence

6394.0 --> 6398.239
they will have more trouble because

6396.4 --> 6398.879999999999
their structural support can't really

6398.239 --> 6401.28
handle

6398.88 --> 6401.92
all that weight as much as they grow

6401.28 --> 6405.679
bigger

6401.92 --> 6409.4400000000005
and that's i accounted for that

6405.679 --> 6413.6
that's why i think that the atlanteans

6409.44 --> 6414.0
had the pyramids because the pyramids

6413.6 --> 6417.76
would

6414.0 --> 6420.159
allow giants to become bigger

6417.76 --> 6421.6
because they would be electrostatically

6420.159 --> 6424.239
charged

6421.6 --> 6426.0
which is proven to give structural

6424.239 --> 6428.32
support

6426.0 --> 6430.48
right that's the train of thought behind

6428.32 --> 6432.239
it so that the pyramids were literally

6430.48 --> 6435.919999999999
the thing that would allow

6432.239 --> 6436.32
giants to survive up until they were

6435.92 --> 6440.159
like

6436.32 --> 6440.799999999999
20 meters or taller that without those

6440.159 --> 6442.879999999999
pyramids

6440.8 --> 6444.08
in that age where things obviously had

6442.88 --> 6447.36
changed and there was less

6444.08 --> 6447.36
energy in the air naturally

6447.6 --> 6451.4400000000005
that naturally they wouldn't become

6449.6 --> 6452.08
bigger than maybe three meters and then

6451.44 --> 6453.839999999999
they would just

6452.08 --> 6456.639
collapse under themselves or under the

6453.84 --> 6460.0
hunger right the the infamous hunger of

6456.639 --> 6460.0
the giants after the flood

6460.159 --> 6464.0
because all the pyramids were all subtly

6462.159 --> 6465.599999999999
disabled didn't work anymore so there

6464.0 --> 6467.119
was no more electric energy in the air

6465.6 --> 6469.04
and suddenly all the giants got

6467.119 --> 6471.599999999999
really really freaking hungry that's

6469.04 --> 6476.0
what i thought has happened that's my

6471.6 --> 6476.0
conception around that

6479.36 --> 6484.0
yeah there is no physical empirical

6481.52 --> 6487.360000000001
evidence i do not claim science

6484.0 --> 6489.52
it's a concept it's an idea but there is

6487.36 --> 6493.04
definitely something about pyramids

6489.52 --> 6494.88
being hydroelectrostatic generators

6493.04 --> 6496.159
look into the pyramid codes very

6494.88 --> 6499.6
extensive research

6496.159 --> 6502.799999999999
done these things are there

6499.6 --> 6505.4400000000005
it's all ancient tech

6502.8 --> 6507.1990000000005
like even using electrics natural

6505.44 --> 6510.08
electrics in rock

6507.199 --> 6511.5199999999995
to be able to naturally pump water for

6510.08 --> 6513.84
crying out loud that's

6511.52 --> 6514.96
unbelievable it still works to this day

6513.84 --> 6516.88
it's demonstrated

6514.96 --> 6518.639
in that movie it's like said like look

6516.88 --> 6522.08
here it is

6518.639 --> 6524.8
it's just there it is

6522.08 --> 6526.639
they show it and all kinds of things so

6524.8 --> 6529.28
i think that that's pyramids and the

6526.639 --> 6530.96
conception of how they were built

6529.28 --> 6532.32
and that they might electrostatically

6530.96 --> 6535.44
feed giants

6532.32 --> 6536.719
that is my concept that is my idea i

6535.44 --> 6540.32
thought that of that

6536.719 --> 6543.52
i think there might be something to it

6540.32 --> 6546.5599999999995
and it's interesting to think about

6543.52 --> 6548.159000000001
i i stuck to that i thought you could

6546.56 --> 6549.92
say i thought it up

6548.159 --> 6551.92
but i think there is something to it it

6549.92 --> 6554.159
might be true

6551.92 --> 6556.0
what killed off the giants well the

6554.159 --> 6559.5599999999995
flood

6556.0 --> 6561.52
the flood suddenly destroyed all the

6559.56 --> 6564.0
hydroelectrostatic

6561.52 --> 6566.0
generators it made the standard flow

6564.0 --> 6568.4
like it it buried it all in mud and

6566.0 --> 6570.8
suddenly the water flow underneath it

6568.4 --> 6571.44
would not continue anymore it would get

6570.8 --> 6573.599
stuck

6571.44 --> 6575.919999999999
the electrostatic output would be gone

6573.599 --> 6578.400000000001
and all the giants just starved to death

6575.92 --> 6579.84
started eating everything until they

6578.4 --> 6582.96
starved to death

6579.84 --> 6585.52
the big ones and the smaller ones they

6582.96 --> 6589.28
might have survived and then eventually

6585.52 --> 6589.280000000001
started to interbreed with humans

6590.159 --> 6593.36
and they might have by the way always

6591.599 --> 6595.1990000000005
have interbred with humans i've even got

6593.36 --> 6596.639
the concept that giants are actually

6595.199 --> 6598.32
born human-sized

6596.639 --> 6600.08
and that they just keep on growing and

6598.32 --> 6601.599
growing and growing and then at a

6600.08 --> 6603.679
certain point they can no longer

6601.599 --> 6606.8
reproduce because they're too big

6603.679 --> 6608.4800000000005
to mate with humans that was also part

6606.8 --> 6610.400000000001
of my conception of what

6608.48 --> 6612.239
giants were because i think that the

6610.4 --> 6613.44
giants kept on growing and then at a

6612.239 --> 6615.36
certain point if their

6613.44 --> 6616.96
structural support could not handle

6615.36 --> 6620.08
their size

6616.96 --> 6623.199
they would just die until the pyramids

6620.08 --> 6625.199
were built to provide

6623.199 --> 6627.44
extra nourishment so that they would

6625.199 --> 6630.0
survive longer and grow bigger

6627.44 --> 6631.839999999999
that's my concept it's a concept it's an

6630.0 --> 6634.639
idea i have no empirical proof for it

6631.84 --> 6634.639
it's an idea

6634.719 --> 6639.84
that's it

6647.76 --> 6654.159000000001
right well look i get it i totally get

6651.44 --> 6656.48
it about oh the giants were evil

6654.159 --> 6657.759999999999
yeah why why do you think that would

6656.48 --> 6660.5599999999995
happen could it be

6657.76 --> 6662.159000000001
because suddenly they were hungry and

6660.56 --> 6663.92
literally would just start

6662.159 --> 6665.679
plucking people off the streets and

6663.92 --> 6668.56
eating them

6665.679 --> 6670.4
right oh and then you think that was

6668.56 --> 6673.599
always there really so how

6670.4 --> 6676.239
were the giants even there why haven't

6673.599 --> 6678.159000000001
they all been hunted to extinction yet

6676.239 --> 6680.5599999999995
if they were always like that no that

6678.159 --> 6683.598999999999
makes no freaking sense

6680.56 --> 6685.360000000001
they were obviously able to sustain

6683.599 --> 6690.08
themselves without just

6685.36 --> 6693.44
eating everything before that

6690.08 --> 6695.28
obviously obviously

6693.44 --> 6697.44
makes no sense if they weren't like how

6695.28 --> 6699.679
could they then ever even grow that much

6697.44 --> 6702.4
what you think that over their lifetime

6699.679 --> 6703.679
whatever it's going to be like 200 years

6702.4 --> 6706.799999999999
they would just

6703.679 --> 6709.119
eat like millions or hundreds of

6706.8 --> 6710.0
millions of people and like all the wild

6709.119 --> 6713.04
animals and

6710.0 --> 6716.32
that makes no freaking sense makes no

6713.04 --> 6718.88
freaking sense whatsoever they had to be

6716.32 --> 6720.799999999999
able to feed themselves in another way

6718.88 --> 6723.04
the only way that i can think them off

6720.8 --> 6725.4400000000005
is by electrostatic

6723.04 --> 6728.48
electricity like mana they would just be

6725.44 --> 6732.0
fed by the electrics

6728.48 --> 6733.919999999999
in the air that's what i think

6732.0 --> 6737.84
it's the only way i can conceive that it

6733.92 --> 6737.84
makes any kind of sense

6740.0 --> 6744.32
how tall were the biggest giants do i

6741.92 --> 6747.04
think i don't know

6744.32 --> 6747.679
wasn't it said like in the bible that

6747.04 --> 6752.08
there were

6747.679 --> 6755.84
like 20 20 meters tall giants

6752.08 --> 6759.04
i don't know i don't know

6755.84 --> 6762.2390000000005
maybe in pre-atlantean age they

6759.04 --> 6764.88
there were humanoids that could grow

6762.239 --> 6766.32
a kilometer tall in like the age of

6764.88 --> 6768.08
wonders i don't know

6766.32 --> 6770.239
maybe there was infinite energy and they

6768.08 --> 6772.719
just just would never stop growing

6770.239 --> 6773.44
because they would never have any kind

6772.719 --> 6776.159
of problem

6773.44 --> 6776.719
with their size that could be i don't

6776.159 --> 6778.199
know

6776.719 --> 6779.76
but that would definitely be

6778.199 --> 6782.96
pre-atlantean

6779.76 --> 6782.96
before atlantis

6784.0 --> 6787.92
in what i've conceived of the age of

6786.08 --> 6789.199
wonders where technically everything is

6787.92 --> 6792.2390000000005
possible and they were just

6789.199 --> 6795.28
absurdly large creatures and

6792.239 --> 6799.44
and bizarre things just

6795.28 --> 6799.44
fantasy maximus basically

6799.52 --> 6802.88
but there's no proof of that whatsoever

6802.159 --> 6804.799999999999
there's no

6802.88 --> 6806.0
no remaining proof whatever was there

6804.8 --> 6809.92
it's all dead

6806.0 --> 6813.599
and it's all harvested recycled

6809.92 --> 6815.4400000000005
it's all gone but yeah atlanta still has

6813.599 --> 6818.159000000001
its remnants

6815.44 --> 6821.839999999999
the giant monolithic structures from

6818.159 --> 6821.839999999999
that time

6825.52 --> 6828.88
artifacts that will blow you away

6826.88 --> 6835.84
literally spiritually of course okay

6828.88 --> 6835.84
daniel field and no doubt

6838.239 --> 6842.799999999999
elephants and whales are able to feed

6840.08 --> 6846.719
themselves without eating people

6842.8 --> 6849.1990000000005
right patricia dockery but don't forget

6846.719 --> 6850.8
especially elephants after they grow too

6849.199 --> 6852.638999999999
large

6850.8 --> 6854.400000000001
eventually they will just collapse under

6852.639 --> 6857.84
their weight and don't forget

6854.4 --> 6861.598999999999
elephants eat enormous amounts of plants

6857.84 --> 6863.04
enormous amounts a lot they need a lot

6861.599 --> 6866.56
and whales

6863.04 --> 6868.8
well whales float so they have less

6866.56 --> 6870.56
they they basically only live in

6868.8 --> 6872.400000000001
effective water weight they will be in

6870.56 --> 6873.280000000001
equilibrium with their surroundings a

6872.4 --> 6875.44
lot

6873.28 --> 6877.28
they only have to withstand the pressure

6875.44 --> 6881.119
from the outside so they will not

6877.28 --> 6882.8
collapse under their own size

6881.119 --> 6886.08
right because they float they're in

6882.8 --> 6887.76
water they don't have the full weight

6886.08 --> 6889.599
they won't have as much structural

6887.76 --> 6892.0
support problems now of course we all

6889.599 --> 6895.04
know once a big whale washes on land

6892.0 --> 6896.88
they're done they will literally just

6895.04 --> 6898.159
collapse under their own weight and then

6896.88 --> 6899.84
die

6898.159 --> 6901.28
right and in the water they don't have

6899.84 --> 6905.599
that problem

6901.28 --> 6909.5199999999995
and then again they eat a lot of krill

6905.599 --> 6913.92
they eat they literally just scoop up

6909.52 --> 6919.84
entire colonies of micro creatures so

6913.92 --> 6919.84
whales do eat plenty

6920.32 --> 6924.159
hey chocolate saying what's up

6925.679 --> 6929.119
you should really watch my video i will

6928.159 --> 6931.199
i will

6929.119 --> 6935.199
but after the flat earth debates which

6931.199 --> 6935.199
is gonna start in about seven minutes so

6936.0 --> 6939.36
oh there's a new eight of hitler in

6937.52 --> 6940.96
namibia yeah i heard that from my own

6939.36 --> 6946.32
benjamin

6940.96 --> 6948.96
this black man called adolf hitler yeah

6946.32 --> 6948.96
so weird

6953.44 --> 6959.28
yo chocolate

6956.719 --> 6960.0
it's only two minutes i know i know i'm

6959.28 --> 6963.36
gonna watch

6960.0 --> 6975.119
it i'm not gonna watch it during my show

6963.36 --> 6976.88
so all right think of the pyramid as a

6975.119 --> 6978.96
battery yeah i do

6976.88 --> 6980.400000000001
or rather an electrostatic generator

6978.96 --> 6985.199
it's like a

6980.4 --> 6989.199
stone-based hydro-powered tesla coil

6985.199 --> 6993.04
that's how i see it i see pyramids as

6989.199 --> 6998.879999999999
stone electric hydro

6993.04 --> 6998.88
powered tesla coil that's how i see them

7001.599 --> 7006.639
or how they used to be that's how they

7003.76 --> 7006.639
used to operate

7009.76 --> 7013.599
back that battery yeah i've seen that

7012.0 --> 7019.199
that's fascinating isn't it

7013.599 --> 7022.8
like the vinegar vinegar-based batteries

7019.199 --> 7022.799999999999
that's pretty cool yeah

7023.92 --> 7028.56
and it's funny too because the that was

7026.4 --> 7029.199
addressed in the pyramid code too by the

7028.56 --> 7032.8
way

7029.199 --> 7034.48
that mini-series was addressed that yeah

7032.8 --> 7036.400000000001
technically you could charge these

7034.48 --> 7037.44
batteries by putting them in certain

7036.4 --> 7040.96
rooms that would be

7037.44 --> 7043.199
rich rife with electrostatic energy

7040.96 --> 7044.159
as as the pyramid was running and they

7043.199 --> 7048.4
would probably just

7044.159 --> 7050.08
bring the batteries in leave them in

7048.4 --> 7051.44
and then at a certain point like okay

7050.08 --> 7053.76
they're fully charged

7051.44 --> 7055.759999999999
then they bring them out and they

7053.76 --> 7059.360000000001
install them somewhere in the city

7055.76 --> 7061.84
with a lamp and that would just run

7059.36 --> 7063.598999999999
the entire day or who knows how long

7061.84 --> 7066.719
yeah it's fascinating how that works

7063.599 --> 7066.719
absolutely fascinating

7071.04 --> 7074.96
how many kilowatts could i don't know

7073.44 --> 7078.239
how

7074.96 --> 7080.8
i'm not an electro engineer really

7078.239 --> 7080.799999999999
i don't know

7082.56 --> 7086.0
the thing is to actually test that you

7085.44 --> 7088.638999999999
would have

7086.0 --> 7089.119
to basically restore one and get it

7088.639 --> 7091.04
running

7089.119 --> 7092.48
as it was originally intended to and

7091.04 --> 7094.96
then you can figure out how much

7092.48 --> 7099.199
electrical output actually comes from it

7094.96 --> 7101.84
you know but still beside

7099.199 --> 7103.919999999999
doing that you also have to realize that

7101.84 --> 7105.76
back then in the atlantean age when they

7103.92 --> 7108.0
were actually installed

7105.76 --> 7110.320000000001
the atmosphere might have been different

7108.0 --> 7112.159
remember the flood happened

7110.32 --> 7114.32
it might have changed a lot of things

7112.159 --> 7115.759999999999
including the content of the air or even

7114.32 --> 7119.44
the level of electric

7115.76 --> 7120.2390000000005
energy in the air the natural electric

7119.44 --> 7122.799999999999
energy

7120.239 --> 7123.598999999999
not created by the pyramids so you don't

7122.8 --> 7129.84
know

7123.599 --> 7129.84
i don't know man

7130.32 --> 7134.96
yeah well don't threaten me i literally

7132.719 --> 7136.639
explained that

7134.96 --> 7140.719
like not even half an hour ago i'm not

7136.639 --> 7140.719
gonna repeat myself in just five minutes

7140.84 --> 7143.84
so

7152.08 --> 7156.5599999999995
if you don't like it well that's fine we

7155.04 --> 7160.159
don't care

7156.56 --> 7162.080000000001
okay we don't care you don't like it

7160.159 --> 7163.598999999999
just get out of here go go somewhere

7162.08 --> 7164.719
else where you hear something that you

7163.599 --> 7168.400000000001
do like

7164.719 --> 7171.119
because we are not here to basically

7168.4 --> 7174.4
yeah might try to make you feel better

7171.119 --> 7174.4
because you don't like it

7174.48 --> 7178.5599999999995
so much has to oh yeah yeah that's why

7176.4 --> 7182.0
you're banned now

7178.56 --> 7182.4800000000005
[ __ ] off get the [ __ ] out you don't like

7182.0 --> 7185.52
it well

7182.48 --> 7188.959999999999
[ __ ] off then i don't have any

7185.52 --> 7192.88
empirical evidence i don't claim science

7188.96 --> 7195.199
it's a concept now the evidence provided

7192.88 --> 7198.32
to me

7195.199 --> 7201.839999999999
to lead to this concept is

7198.32 --> 7205.92
derived a lot from the pyramid code

7201.84 --> 7208.719
a mini series about the pyramids

7205.92 --> 7209.84
and that they are actually basically the

7208.719 --> 7212.0
evidence

7209.84 --> 7213.119000000001
and the research they did that they

7212.0 --> 7215.119
gathered

7213.119 --> 7216.799999999999
to come to the conclusion that the

7215.119 --> 7219.92
pyramids of giza were

7216.8 --> 7223.119000000001
actually hydroelectric

7219.92 --> 7224.88
generators right

7223.119 --> 7226.159
and they treat that in the course of

7224.88 --> 7228.8
like three hours

7226.159 --> 7230.239
in the mini series so yeah you want to

7228.8 --> 7232.88
know about it

7230.239 --> 7234.879999999999
you go look it i'm not just gonna do

7232.88 --> 7236.4800000000005
that for you you want to know it you're

7234.88 --> 7238.719
gonna have to do the research you don't

7236.48 --> 7241.759999999999
want to know it well [ __ ] off then

7238.719 --> 7243.18
i don't care right it's your problem not

very concise elaborate arguments on

7271.84 --> 7276.400000000001
several

7273.04 --> 7277.199
regions science with relative density as

7276.4 --> 7280.08
well as

7277.199 --> 7281.119
yeah getting back to some of the older

7280.08 --> 7283.44
concepts about

7281.119 --> 7285.199
the pyramids and the giants it's good to

7283.44 --> 7287.5199999999995
