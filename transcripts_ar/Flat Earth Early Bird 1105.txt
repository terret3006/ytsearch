90.119 --> 94.64
and yeah I could very much use it

95.04 --> 99.659
anyway

96.86 --> 102.24
whether today is

99.659 --> 104.88000000000001
yeah gray soup

102.24 --> 108.119
doesn't seem to be much moist

104.88 --> 111.5
hang around though it's not very Misty

108.119 --> 111.5
but yeah gray soup

111.659 --> 115.57900000000001
and seems to be kind of wind still

117.18 --> 123.0
but yeah I'm

120.0 --> 124.92
I feel it's kind of cold

123.0 --> 127.2
but yeah that might be just my own

124.92 --> 129.86
condition

127.2 --> 129.86
that

132.08 --> 137.0
because

133.92 --> 137.0
a little sore

137.16 --> 139.879
it's uh

145.26 --> 148.92
because

146.64 --> 150.48
yeah I've been basically forced to

148.92 --> 154.379
change

150.48 --> 157.07999999999998
my diet a little diet

154.379 --> 158.7
like not drinking any beers yesterday at

157.08 --> 162.36
all

158.7 --> 165.17999999999998
and yeah I'm kind of feeling that today

162.36 --> 168.0
and one way it's like good

165.18 --> 171.239
and the other way yeah the other hand

168.0 --> 172.8
there's some organs apparently that are

171.239 --> 175.879
like hey

172.8 --> 175.87900000000002
this is not normal

176.34 --> 181.08
but yeah it might be a good thing

177.92 --> 183.23899999999998
because I'm actually giving my organs a

181.08 --> 184.98000000000002
break like that

183.239 --> 187.26
right

184.98 --> 190.07999999999998
hello clutch

187.26 --> 191.519
first in chat Mike's dunnich Bill Nye

190.08 --> 193.37900000000002
the science denier

191.519 --> 199.459
good to see you all

193.379 --> 199.459
it is Sunday the 19th of December 2021

208.44 --> 214.459
you've been fasting it's been good okay

211.62 --> 214.459
good for you

216.78 --> 222.959
right yeah well for me like beer my

219.84 --> 227.06
beers are kind of like part of my diet

222.959 --> 227.06
it sounds weird but yeah it does

227.22 --> 234.06
actually nourish in some ways

231.42 --> 235.92
so to me it's like okay now this is

234.06 --> 238.92000000000002
weird because now I'm suddenly more

235.92 --> 241.26
hungry really

238.92 --> 243.89999999999998
uh

241.26 --> 246.78
I actually had it even a little bit of

243.9 --> 248.09900000000002
breakfast this morning because yeah it's

246.78 --> 250.2
different

248.099 --> 252.78
it's all different now

250.2 --> 255.54
because of this

252.78 --> 258.66
uh Jeff gassett

255.54 --> 262.28
did I watch those videos oh those yeah

258.66 --> 262.28000000000003
sure those videos

265.8 --> 272.6
now I did actually watch uh the video

269.34 --> 272.59999999999997
about southern France

272.639 --> 277.139
from that researcher historian

275.639 --> 280.68
guy

277.139 --> 285.479
and yeah watch the first three parts of

280.68 --> 285.479
that it was absolutely mind-blowing

286.02 --> 290.94
also yeah I've just right before the

288.72 --> 294.12
show start started

290.94 --> 296.699
I was watching Owen Benjamin

294.12 --> 299.639
and he was making mention of it too

296.699 --> 302.1
yesterday so

299.639 --> 304.32
southern France

302.1 --> 307.68
it's really interesting and yeah I'm

304.32 --> 311.039
gonna probably spend the rest of my day

307.68 --> 314.699
like continuing watching that because it

311.039 --> 318.08
was really interesting

314.699 --> 318.08
like so much detail

319.16 --> 323.41900000000004
yeah and watch the

324.9 --> 330.08
like especially the video about the

327.0 --> 330.08
qatars was

330.74 --> 334.52
absolutely mind-blowing

335.28 --> 339.59999999999997
was just

337.32 --> 341.699
to me surreal

339.6 --> 344.58000000000004
because I think I'm fun with that before

341.699 --> 347.759
in the time again when it wasn't

344.58 --> 350.46
all that serious

347.759 --> 352.97900000000004
and it's kind of like a shock flashback

350.46 --> 355.19899999999996
to me in ways

352.979 --> 359.0
I think I was like first informed about

355.199 --> 359.0
that when it was like 12 or something

359.039 --> 366.62
and yeah there they were very

363.259 --> 366.62
fascinating group

367.62 --> 370.22
uh

371.34 --> 374.35999999999996
hey service day

375.539 --> 379.979
I missed you yesterday I was actually

377.52 --> 383.29999999999995
hoping you would come by but yeah you

379.979 --> 383.3
weren't there probably busy

391.86 --> 397.68
9 10 11 0 Jesus all right yeah well I'm

395.22 --> 400.259
not there yet

397.68 --> 402.0
but uh yeah I'm definitely gonna spend

400.259 --> 404.539
more time watching that it's really

402.0 --> 404.539
interesting

410.699 --> 414.91900000000004
hey we're up h on sunchat

422.099 --> 424.639
right

424.68 --> 430.319
anyway

427.259 --> 433.56
yeah I'm up for

430.319 --> 436.34000000000003
a full show but yeah I do have like a

433.56 --> 436.34
weird neck

436.56 --> 440.28000000000003
it's like this

438.24 --> 442.319
feeling of muscle cramp in a very

440.28 --> 445.15999999999997
specific location and I'm pretty sure it

442.319 --> 445.16
probably has to do

445.62 --> 452.72
I'm fairly sure it has to do with

449.58 --> 452.71999999999997
my pancreas

454.319 --> 459.599
because yeah that's going to be involved

456.36 --> 462.319
in like alcohol as well

459.599 --> 462.319
uh

463.44 --> 466.21999999999997
uh

469.319 --> 474.91900000000004
oh okay service day all right that

472.319 --> 474.91900000000004
that's fine

478.8 --> 482.599
that must be nice to be busy

491.94 --> 494.94
foreign

520.14 --> 523.5
I do hope it's not going to get any

521.94 --> 526.019
worse

523.5 --> 528.86
because that's then yeah I'm gonna go

526.019 --> 528.86
into Sig mode

534.0 --> 539.82
but at least it's not like my my

536.94 --> 542.7600000000001
intestines or anything like all the week

539.82 --> 545.36
last week

542.76 --> 545.36
uh

552.0 --> 559.399
right yeah if this keeps up I might

555.48 --> 559.399
I have to cut the show a little short

576.54 --> 582.62
right yeah the cathars did indeed seem

579.48 --> 582.62
to be gnostics

583.2 --> 591.2
but I just have to think about it it I

587.16 --> 591.1999999999999
just watched it I still have to like

591.899 --> 597.24
get some more clarity

594.18 --> 600.9799999999999
in myself in order to like figure out

597.24 --> 600.98
how to regard that even

612.0 --> 616.64
yeah there are certain aspects about it

614.399 --> 619.079
that are like indirect

616.64 --> 621.92
opposition to my own personal

619.079 --> 621.92
convictions

622.44 --> 626.36
so I I gotta think about it

629.16 --> 633.12
he thinks they were the religious order

631.56 --> 635.8389999999999
well

633.12 --> 635.839
could be

662.399 --> 664.579
foreign

685.82 --> 691.1400000000001
yeah yesterday

688.079 --> 692.6999999999999
so overall very informative day since I

691.14 --> 695.899
did spend a lot of time actually

692.7 --> 695.899
watching these videos

696.0 --> 698.72
uh

699.899 --> 703.64
I also was on ball busters

704.04 --> 710.06
all sobered up

706.74 --> 710.0600000000001
uh yeah it was a good show

710.16 --> 714.779
we had this weird random super upvote

712.98 --> 718.9200000000001
thing again

714.779 --> 720.0
like it shot up to like 1100. really

718.92 --> 722.2199999999999
weird

720.0 --> 725.3
all in like the time span of like 30

722.22 --> 725.3000000000001
seconds crazy

730.26 --> 733.399
but it was a good show

735.12 --> 738.079
and

738.3 --> 743.04
I completely missed out on

740.639 --> 744.9590000000001
on flatter day night

743.04 --> 747.0
from Martin Luther because I was just

744.959 --> 750.7399999999999
hanging around with Adam afterward

747.0 --> 750.74
talking about well this sort of thing

750.959 --> 755.899
pretty much until like one o'clock at

753.12 --> 755.899
night so

758.1 --> 761.36
that's what I've been doing

769.44 --> 771.98
all right

772.5 --> 779.1
oh yeah I also yeah popped in randomly

775.92 --> 784.079
at somebody in D life

779.1 --> 787.139
was like going through like NASA CGI

784.079 --> 788.519
videos and he was a complete Normie like

787.139 --> 790.98
he didn't know so he was like oh yeah

788.519 --> 792.9590000000001
this is all science so I kind of started

790.98 --> 795.12
laying down

792.959 --> 797.5189999999999
without saying Flat Earth

795.12 --> 798.54
some details like yeah about that sun

797.519 --> 800.72
you know

798.54 --> 803.3389999999999
how do you know it's even an object

800.72 --> 805.0790000000001
approach angular size increase where's

803.339 --> 807.4200000000001
the live footage of the angular size

805.079 --> 809.459
increase while approaching the Sun

807.42 --> 811.139
and he was like like was totally

809.459 --> 814.1999999999999
flustered by that

811.139 --> 816.66
did not really know what to say about it

814.2 --> 820.32
didn't like get triggered or anything

816.66 --> 822.54
and then we like he moved on with

820.32 --> 823.8000000000001
another yeah it was just like reviewing

822.54 --> 825.24
videos

823.8 --> 827.8199999999999
but

825.24 --> 830.82
moved on to like some spooky ghost

827.82 --> 830.82
reviewer

832.199 --> 837.06
with some interesting footage and I yeah

834.6 --> 839.76
I gave my insights shared some things

837.06 --> 842.16
about myself like how I saw my mother's

839.76 --> 844.56
ghost and all that

842.16 --> 847.5
and then eventually started playing this

844.56 --> 850.199
video which was like really creepy

847.5 --> 851.94
he didn't expect that to happen too I

850.199 --> 854.699
think it was like the second part of

851.94 --> 859.019
that ghost show review what I basically

854.699 --> 862.019
like with happy corporate animation

859.019 --> 864.839
basically going through the entirety of

862.019 --> 866.94
demonology and just like saying like oh

864.839 --> 869.8800000000001
yeah this demon that team oh you can do

866.94 --> 873.3000000000001
this but you can have that sort of like

869.88 --> 877.4399999999999
a freaking manual on how to deal with

873.3 --> 880.38
demons it's like what the [ __ ] is that

877.44 --> 883.5
like that's a video that's just publicly

880.38 --> 885.62
available on the internet that is [ __ ]

883.5 --> 885.62
up

887.399 --> 892.139
like there's some really [ __ ] up

889.5 --> 895.74
videos out there and that are like being

892.139 --> 900.0790000000001
presented like it's all normal and cute

895.74 --> 900.0790000000001
really messed up satanic stuff

900.12 --> 907.76
like not glorifying it but just like

903.36 --> 907.76
sharing way too much information

908.399 --> 916.019
like you shouldn't be talking about that

911.639 --> 918.48
like unless you know who you are facing

916.019 --> 921.24
and then you adapt the information to

918.48 --> 923.94
that person in private

921.24 --> 927.139
it was crazy

923.94 --> 927.139
so that also happened

927.48 --> 931.22
that was before the ball busters

938.16 --> 944.16
it was five likes and yet well no

942.18 --> 947.279
that's maybe that's what you saw Jeff

944.16 --> 948.24
gas had but to me those votes are still

947.279 --> 951.48
there

948.24 --> 954.259
dude I'll show you I'll just show you

951.48 --> 954.259
how they're there

959.94 --> 963.259
Yep they're still there

986.579 --> 991.459
all right see

988.44 --> 991.4590000000001
it's right there

997.98 --> 1004.279
so yeah I don't know how that works on

1001.759 --> 1007.36
your side but it's right there

1004.279 --> 1007.36
1.1 k

1024.319 --> 1026.3799999999999
m

1026.9 --> 1030.4
hey that's that fellow

1030.919 --> 1033.5790000000002
see you

1044.5 --> 1049.22
777 views

1047.0 --> 1052.52
okay

1049.22 --> 1055.46
well the viewers do typically run up

1052.52 --> 1057.8799999999999
as more time passes that happens with

1055.46 --> 1057.88
any video

1058.94 --> 1062.44
hey seeking star water

1069.02 --> 1075.4
watch the ISS contest oh okay well I

1072.98 --> 1075.4
missed it

1087.26 --> 1092.5
I didn't see notification for that

1089.48 --> 1092.5
that's weird

1098.48 --> 1104.6
well Eric Dubai had a kind of a music

1101.36 --> 1108.74
video I think he wrapped on it himself

1104.6 --> 1112.0
psycho attention clowns yeah I was

1108.74 --> 1112.0
was pretty decent

1116.9 --> 1120.3400000000001
so he's keeping busy

1121.94 --> 1124.6000000000001
uh

1125.539 --> 1128.539
foreign

1151.28 --> 1154.28

1156.2 --> 1165.46
scared really Ralph Rodriguez

1160.46 --> 1165.46
come on let's Gary it was just well

1166.64 --> 1170.3600000000001
repulsive

1168.14 --> 1173.0
like yeah those types of people actually

1170.36 --> 1177.1399999999999
exist and

1173.0 --> 1177.14
in large numbers unfortunately

1185.98 --> 1192.88
intentionally stopped showering Isis

all right

1196.039 --> 1199.0
ah

1218.559 --> 1222.28

1226.64 --> 1229.1200000000001
after this

1231.08 --> 1236.9189999999999
maybe that'll help it a bit

1233.659 --> 1236.919
because it's really sore

1250.539 --> 1256.46
okay Ralph yeah I get what you mean yeah

1254.179 --> 1259.179
I felt that too I just just I'm not

1256.46 --> 1259.179
really afraid

1259.64 --> 1267.46
but it is worrisome

1263.36 --> 1267.4599999999998
all right that's how I would say it

1273.62 --> 1278.7399999999998
hey steamy traveler I'm a feeling today

1275.84 --> 1278.74
well

1278.78 --> 1282.799
different

1280.88 --> 1285.0200000000002
I hadn't been like I hadn't had any

1282.799 --> 1286.8799999999999
bears yesterday

1285.02 --> 1290.12
and

1286.88 --> 1292.22
yeah but barely had anything to smoke

1290.12 --> 1293.6
either well I did have tobacco but it's

1292.22 --> 1296.0
not the same

1293.6 --> 1299.9599999999998
and yeah today

1296.0 --> 1302.6
seems to be like a response from my

1299.96 --> 1305.9
organs like ouch

1302.6 --> 1308.059
but that could simply be like

1305.9 --> 1309.38
a relief ouch where they're actually

1308.059 --> 1312.46
like

1309.38 --> 1315.2600000000002
to look at me personifying my organs

1312.46 --> 1318.26
where they're like yeah finally we're

1315.26 --> 1320.299
actually getting a break

1318.26 --> 1322.46
because I have been drinking it daily

1320.299 --> 1324.799
for quite a while even though it's not

1322.46 --> 1327.6200000000001
been like too much or anything it still

1324.799 --> 1329.36
it was always there so maybe it's a

1327.62 --> 1332.26
response to that

1329.36 --> 1332.26
just like

1333.74 --> 1339.2
yeah just like if you're a really heavy

1337.22 --> 1341.059
worker and then you take a week off

1339.2 --> 1343.96
guess what you're gonna get sick it

1341.059 --> 1343.96
could be that effect

1345.34 --> 1350.72
but yeah this is involving my I think

1348.62 --> 1353.7199999999998
it's my pancreas it's

1350.72 --> 1356.1200000000001
it it kind of has to be it's not like my

1353.72 --> 1359.539
kidneys or anything it's just that one

1356.12 --> 1359.539
spot ah

1361.52 --> 1370.24
it might be like slightly inflamed

1365.299 --> 1370.24
it's it's not like really terrible but

1371.539 --> 1378.2
it it's kind of comparable to when you

1374.659 --> 1380.9
got a rip that's like slightly set wrong

1378.2 --> 1384.799
and that can hurt like the muscle type

1380.9 --> 1386.96
of cramp hurt that's what it feels like

1384.799 --> 1388.82
I thought it was my back at first but it

1386.96 --> 1391.48
no it's not

1388.82 --> 1391.48
ah

1396.679 --> 1404.919
but yeah I'll be all right

1400.179 --> 1404.919
I'm not expecting it to get any worse

1405.14 --> 1410.179
I think a hot shower might help

1407.539 --> 1413.5
but yeah other than that I'm just very

1410.179 --> 1413.5
clear-minded right now

1419.12 --> 1423.6399999999999
and I've been doing some studying

1425.659 --> 1432.2600000000002
as in watching really good videos with

1428.659 --> 1435.64
lots of research details

1432.26 --> 1435.64
from historians

1440.059 --> 1446.2
oh yeah also bumped into this article

1443.0 --> 1446.2
just browsing around

1449.779 --> 1452.559
apparently

1453.86 --> 1457.24
there's this going on

1457.58 --> 1462.62
which is kind of inter yeah well it's a

1460.22 --> 1466.039
creepy one hand it's interesting on the

1462.62 --> 1467.8999999999999
other because yeah that was even like a

1466.039 --> 1470.779
thing in

1467.9 --> 1474.6200000000001
Star Trek Voyager

1470.779 --> 1477.32
like that from the article is exactly

1474.62 --> 1481.059
what was used in Star Trek Voyager the

1477.32 --> 1481.059
main computer was organic

1482.72 --> 1491.3600000000001
it was basically yeah a brain system

1487.34 --> 1494.0
like like from scratch designed to do

1491.36 --> 1496.52
that and apparently

1494.0 --> 1499.52
well they're right now

1496.52 --> 1502.0
working with that in Australia in a

1499.52 --> 1502.0
laboratory

1504.38 --> 1508.22
so on the one hand that's kind of creepy

1506.659 --> 1510.7
on the other hand it's just really

1508.22 --> 1510.7
interesting

1512.48 --> 1519.26
NAC is amazing for Dragon I don't know

1516.679 --> 1521.5590000000002
what NAC is Ralph Rodriguez never heard

1519.26 --> 1521.559
of that

1529.76 --> 1534.5
you have never seen them more through

1531.919 --> 1538.659
research you mean thorough

1534.5 --> 1538.659
clutch sorrow researcher

1546.86 --> 1552.4599999999998
the planet well that's already

1548.919 --> 1552.46
presupposition right there

1560.26 --> 1564.74
it's almost what

1568.88 --> 1571.48
is this

1586.419 --> 1592.5200000000002
clutch catharts are an offshoot of a

1589.58 --> 1595.22
castle no they are not

1592.52 --> 1596.96
did you even know Matthew Hall

1595.22 --> 1600.2
that

1596.96 --> 1602.8400000000001
when they're The Crusade

1600.2 --> 1606.2
the first Target the Catholic Church

1602.84 --> 1610.279
targeted the very very first Target

1606.2 --> 1613.4
were the cathars did you even know that

1610.279 --> 1616.12
they are definitely not some branch of

1613.4 --> 1616.1200000000001
Catholicism

1619.52 --> 1626.44
and if you'd like look into their deeper

1621.74 --> 1626.44
philosophy you will know why not

1627.08 --> 1631.82
because they pretty much recognize that

1629.72 --> 1633.88
the Catholic church was the Earthly

1631.82 --> 1637.36
devil

1633.88 --> 1637.3600000000001
claiming domain

1638.539 --> 1644.419
so they're definitely not if they were

1641.0 --> 1646.6
not a branch of Catholicism at all

1644.419 --> 1646.6000000000001
foreign

1658.84 --> 1663.6999999999998
they are Matthew no no they were not

1679.64 --> 1684.74
they had the same start Point what does

1682.94 --> 1686.539
that have to do with it how does that

1684.74 --> 1690.34
make them Catholic

1686.539 --> 1690.34
that makes them competition

1732.38 --> 1738.14
so confused about sarcasm Oh you mean

1735.62 --> 1740.86
you don't have a point okay I'll get the

1738.14 --> 1740.8600000000001
[ __ ] out then

1742.46 --> 1745.46
uh

1765.2 --> 1773.559
okay Matthew Hall fine that's

1769.94 --> 1773.559
that's how you see it I'm sure

1822.98 --> 1825.76
man

1826.1 --> 1829.0
at all

1830.299 --> 1833.299
man

1848.36 --> 1853.58
hey

1850.7 --> 1855.7
hello Adam Price yeah thanks for popping

1853.58 --> 1855.6999999999998
by

1857.419 --> 1862.039
I'm glad you appreciate my contribution

1859.46 --> 1865.96
to Fed I do my best

1862.039 --> 1865.96
sometimes it's hard to get in between

1873.74 --> 1876.519
hello Jose

1902.84 --> 1905.4399999999998
ah

1938.84 --> 1944.899
yeah Adam

1941.74 --> 1947.86
hello by the way

1944.899 --> 1947.86
ah

1963.7 --> 1969.38
no they're not Jose you stupid baller

1968.0 --> 1972.74
wankers

1969.38 --> 1975.38
it's a freaking glitch

1972.74 --> 1978.08
it doesn't even work that way why would

1975.38 --> 1980.72
they give money for a bunch of useless

1978.08 --> 1984.26
votes they don't give a [ __ ] I don't

1980.72 --> 1987.98
give a [ __ ] it's a gimmick

1984.26 --> 1991.34
like have you even realized that it's

1987.98 --> 1994.88
probably a freaking baller

1991.34 --> 1998.08
that did that just so they could try and

1994.88 --> 1998.0800000000002
troll him about it

2000.519 --> 2006.039
there's not

2002.26 --> 2009.519
they're not gonna buy freaking up votes

2006.039 --> 2009.519
it's [ __ ]

2020.559 --> 2023.34
no

2024.82 --> 2029.86
I mean maybe if they like gotten an

2027.64 --> 2032.7990000000002
offer for free like oh yeah we can just

2029.86 --> 2034.1789999999999
do that then I think like okay Nathan

2032.799 --> 2036.7
might just say like oh yeah sure

2034.179 --> 2040.659
whatever it's if it's free

2036.7 --> 2044.38
he's not gonna pay money to do have that

2040.659 --> 2044.38
happen that's preposterous

2047.62 --> 2052.54
yeah by the way I even mentioned how

2049.839 --> 2056.399
it's actually a nuisance when it happens

2052.54 --> 2056.399
for the stats so

2057.579 --> 2059.76
foreign

2070.06 --> 2075.94
right well it might be a YouTube glitch

2072.52 --> 2078.339
or it might be a [ __ ] baller having

2075.94 --> 2081.099
done that because they can because

2078.339 --> 2084.099
stupid [ __ ] gamma Ballers out there

2081.099 --> 2085.54
make sock accounts they have thousands

2084.099 --> 2087.8790000000004
of them

2085.54 --> 2090.099
and they [ __ ] around like a bunch of

2087.879 --> 2092.44
political operatives

2090.099 --> 2093.76
trying to smear everybody that's flat

2092.44 --> 2095.919
earther yeah

2093.76 --> 2098.6800000000003
is much more likely that it was that

2095.919 --> 2102.06
like they're not gonna spend money on

2098.68 --> 2106.06
something that's completely useless

2102.06 --> 2106.06
completely useless

2107.26 --> 2111.119
only Ballers do that [ __ ]

2119.5 --> 2122.5
foreign

2165.4 --> 2167.579
foreign

2192.28 --> 2198.42
I don't even remember that service day

2195.16 --> 2198.42
oh my God

2228.359 --> 2234.359
cranberry juice

2231.16 --> 2234.359
I don't have that

2258.3 --> 2265.119
I'm gonna try some

2261.24 --> 2267.64
magnesium citrate maybe that'll help God

2265.119 --> 2269.82
because this is like getting it

2267.64 --> 2272.94
literally feels like somebody is like

2269.82 --> 2277.8
aggressively poking in my side

2272.94 --> 2277.8
constantly it's really distracting

2300.599 --> 2308.1400000000003
wear inside at my pancreas Zone monkey

2305.26 --> 2310.3590000000004
but it makes sense though

2308.14 --> 2313.18
been having some issues with that

2310.359 --> 2316.0
slightly not kidney stones no no no no

2313.18 --> 2318.339
no no no no that would be a lot more

2316.0 --> 2319.839
painful and would probably induce a

2318.339 --> 2322.18
fever

2319.839 --> 2325.42
it's probably my pancreas slightly

2322.18 --> 2328.6189999999997
inflamed because well radical diet

2325.42 --> 2328.619
change pretty much

2329.26 --> 2333.3
no it's not a freaking kidney stone

2334.24 --> 2338.3199999999997
oh

2335.56 --> 2340.24
yeah or well it would have literally

2338.32 --> 2343.3
appeared out of nowhere

2340.24 --> 2345.5789999999997
but it doesn't feel like that

2343.3 --> 2349.5
because I've had one before it's very

2345.579 --> 2349.5
different very different type of pain

2352.3 --> 2354.96
ugh

2364.48 --> 2367.48
foreign

2394.06 --> 2400.48
okay well look if it persists

2397.0 --> 2403.06
then I will probably have it

2400.48 --> 2404.319
I will like cross-reference it with my

2403.06 --> 2407.16
dad and

2404.319 --> 2407.16
and all that

2422.76 --> 2427.78
but I would be very surprised if it was

2426.7 --> 2430.56
that

2427.78 --> 2430.5600000000004
ah

2439.78 --> 2443.26
all right service day thanks for popping

2441.94 --> 2446.16
by

2443.26 --> 2446.1600000000003
see you next time

2460.9 --> 2469.1800000000003
yeah nobody cares Jose nobody cares here

2465.599 --> 2471.6400000000003
that you're all happy about being who

2469.18 --> 2473.98
you are with the delusion and the lies

2471.64 --> 2475.839
and the denial we don't care that you're

2473.98 --> 2478.42
happy about it okay

2475.839 --> 2481.599
if you're really happy about it just be

2478.42 --> 2483.52
happy about it we don't care

2481.599 --> 2486.42
that you're happy about your freaking

2483.52 --> 2486.42
delusion okay

2493.839 --> 2496.68
uh

2500.56 --> 2504.66
I was touching my kidney well

2505.48 --> 2509.7
no no I'm not

2510.52 --> 2516.7599999999998
kidney would be lower this is like

2513.579 --> 2519.3590000000004
behind my ribs okay that's not where my

2516.76 --> 2521.6800000000003
kidney is as far as I know

2519.359 --> 2524.68
kidney is like

2521.68 --> 2526.72
more lower back closer to my spine

2524.68 --> 2529.72
that's not where this is this is

2526.72 --> 2532.359
underneath the ribs that's why I thought

2529.72 --> 2535.8999999999996
at first like oh I got a wrong rib set

2532.359 --> 2536.74
or whatever but it I don't think it is

2535.9 --> 2539.859
that

2536.74 --> 2543.4799999999996
kidneys are huge well only if you

2539.859 --> 2543.48
if you overuse them

2547.359 --> 2555.5789999999997
no but I've never ever had an issue with

2551.44 --> 2559.14
my left kidney ever so no I don't think

2555.579 --> 2559.1400000000003
it is I really don't

2561.64 --> 2569.14
like I know where my organs are okay I'm

2565.3 --> 2570.46
like very consciously aware

2569.14 --> 2572.14
through

2570.46 --> 2575.5
sensory

2572.14 --> 2576.819
I know what it is I know where it is I'm

2575.5 --> 2579.72
not easily

2576.819 --> 2579.72
mistaken

2583.48 --> 2585.9
this thing

2600.76 --> 2605.1600000000003
pancreas is behind the stomach yeah

2606.7 --> 2614.7999999999997
well this is pretty much right beside it

2609.28 --> 2619.78
yeah but let me please clarify that the

2614.8 --> 2621.099
kidney is not behind your ribs okay

2619.78 --> 2622.78
yeah

2621.099 --> 2627.0
it isn't

2622.78 --> 2627.0
that's not where that is it's lower

2640.9 --> 2642.9
um

2646.24 --> 2650.7999999999997
developing an ulcer

2648.4 --> 2652.839
well then I would absolutely feel it in

2650.8 --> 2655.2400000000002
my stomach

2652.839 --> 2656.38
so I don't think it's that either look

2655.24 --> 2658.359
guys

2656.38 --> 2661.42
like what's the problem here I already

2658.359 --> 2664.48
said it's my pancreas yeah

2661.42 --> 2666.94
that's my conclusion

2664.48 --> 2669.64
I I don't understand why you're all just

2666.94 --> 2672.16
defaulting on me being wrong about that

2669.64 --> 2674.6189999999997
when I'm pretty sure it is right I've

2672.16 --> 2677.56
been having like slight issues with that

2674.619 --> 2680.079
I've pretty much inherited slight issues

2677.56 --> 2681.88
with that from my mother she had issues

2680.079 --> 2683.44
with it she eventually even got like

2681.88 --> 2686.619
diabetes from it

2683.44 --> 2689.68
or so she thought

2686.619 --> 2692.319
I'm pretty sure it's that and yeah it it

2689.68 --> 2693.7
makes perfect sense I basically quit an

2692.319 --> 2698.02
entire day

2693.7 --> 2701.68
like no alcohol whatsoever no sugar

2698.02 --> 2704.56
and every time like I would have coffee

2701.68 --> 2707.44
before it would like have a bad impact

2704.56 --> 2710.14
I'm pretty sure it's that yeah it's that

2707.44 --> 2712.96
it's that it's that I know what this is

2710.14 --> 2716.02
it's my pancreas it's that I know the

2712.96 --> 2719.619
location I know the relating issues I

2716.02 --> 2722.619
know what probably caused it yeah it's

2719.619 --> 2725.98
that it not my kidneys it's not an ulcer

2722.619 --> 2727.9
it's not anything else it's that

2725.98 --> 2730.68
crying out loud

2727.9 --> 2730.6800000000003
ah

2753.22 --> 2760.2999999999997
or I might be completely mistaken and it

2756.819 --> 2763.619
is actually a rip situation

2760.3 --> 2765.2200000000003
I might have like slept in a wrong

2763.619 --> 2768.6400000000003
composure

2765.22 --> 2770.56
last night right it might actually just

2768.64 --> 2773.5
be my rib and it just happens to be

2770.56 --> 2776.7
right there on that location

2773.5 --> 2776.7
that would be weird

2814.54 --> 2820.98
man he had a herdy as a kid wow that

2817.96 --> 2820.98
sucks Matthew Hall

2843.7 --> 2849.22
right but yeah I'm gonna

2845.68 --> 2852.66
keep doing it like I'm I'm really

2849.22 --> 2852.66
staying off the Bears for a while

2858.46 --> 2863.76
and yeah maybe even like

2861.22 --> 2863.7599999999998
everything

2864.339 --> 2867.64
because I feel like I need to recover

2865.96 --> 2869.8
I've been feeling like I needed to

2867.64 --> 2872.0789999999997
recover anyway that's why I wasn't all

2869.8 --> 2875.76
stressed out yesterday with the prospect

2872.079 --> 2875.76
of not being able to get beers

2882.04 --> 2886.839
upper abdominal pain

2884.619 --> 2890.94
radiating to your back

2886.839 --> 2890.94
tenderness when touching of them yeah

2892.059 --> 2898.6800000000003
fever rapid pulse nausea well okay well

2895.54 --> 2898.68
it's not that bad

2899.8 --> 2905.6800000000003
I'm just saying I think it's slightly

2902.619 --> 2907.839
inflamed because the conditions just

2905.68 --> 2911.9199999999996
changed radically

2907.839 --> 2914.98
compared to like the last three years

2911.92 --> 2917.579
that should be normal

2914.98 --> 2917.579
right

2941.8 --> 2946.48
or again it could literally just be a

2945.52 --> 2949.119
muscle

2946.48 --> 2954.099
it could be a muscle

2949.119 --> 2956.5
that's just really inconveniently placed

2954.099 --> 2958.6600000000003
I kind of hope it's a muscle I don't

2956.5 --> 2960.64
really want to have like various

2958.66 --> 2963.8999999999996
problems if you know what I mean not

2960.64 --> 2963.9
really like yeah

2965.44 --> 2970.0
and I do get like this impulse

2967.599 --> 2971.98
intuitively like I'm supposed to massage

2970.0 --> 2975.64
those rips

2971.98 --> 2978.7
so maybe maybe it is like the last rip

2975.64 --> 2979.92
you know the floaty one I think I might

2978.7 --> 2983.98
have like

2979.92 --> 2986.319
rested on it in a bad position where

2983.98 --> 2988.42
it's basically been sleeping on it while

2986.319 --> 2991.0
it was being bent

2988.42 --> 2993.94
because that's gonna hurt I yeah I

2991.0 --> 2997.2
actually think it might just be that

2993.94 --> 2999.7000000000003
I mean back issues can just be

2997.2 --> 3003.6189999999997
overwhelmingly painful

2999.7 --> 3003.6189999999997
even though they're not that severe

3007.26 --> 3013.3190000000004
so let's just go for that and forget

3009.66 --> 3015.98
about the organ issues

3013.319 --> 3015.98
huh

3028.02 --> 3035.28
all right yeah well back inside with me

3031.319 --> 3037.92
it's really local it's really local this

3035.28 --> 3041.6400000000003
is not like radiating out throughout my

3037.92 --> 3045.78
entire back or anything it's just this

3041.64 --> 3047.8799999999997
one spot one spot happens to be exactly

3045.78 --> 3051.2400000000002
where my floaty rib is

3047.88 --> 3053.04
so in retrospect with all the input you

3051.24 --> 3055.2599999999998
guys have given me also what typically

3053.04 --> 3057.599
accompanies issues

3055.26 --> 3062.0400000000004
I think it's probably just my freaking

3057.599 --> 3064.559
rib I just slept in a wrong position

3062.04 --> 3068.3
ah

3064.559 --> 3068.3
because I just keep

3068.76 --> 3072.0200000000004
I just wanna like

3072.48 --> 3079.8
like plop it like like I feel like it it

3076.319 --> 3082.079
is pro yeah it must be that

3079.8 --> 3084.3
I'm gonna get a hot shower after the

3082.079 --> 3087.3590000000004
show and that would probably fix it I'll

3084.3 --> 3089.46
get back to you about it tomorrow

3087.359 --> 3091.7999999999997
uh

3089.46 --> 3094.559
all right enough about that it's not

3091.8 --> 3097.3390000000004
really an interesting subject

3094.559 --> 3097.3390000000004
uh

3111.9 --> 3116.2200000000003
whoa Matthew okay that's some serious

3114.96 --> 3118.619
workouts

3116.22 --> 3119.8799999999997
yeah serious workouts do have side

3118.619 --> 3121.98
effects though

3119.88 --> 3124.44
got to be careful not to rush it too

3121.98 --> 3126.66
much or you're list literally like

3124.44 --> 3129.0
overburden

3126.66 --> 3132.0789999999997
your ligaments and all that

3129.0 --> 3132.079
you got to be careful

3135.18 --> 3139.5
it's the human equivalent of Googling

3137.22 --> 3141.54
your Symphony I know it is I know and I

3139.5 --> 3144.119
know you guys are just

3141.54 --> 3146.16
trying to care for me I appreciate that

3144.119 --> 3149.099
but

3146.16 --> 3152.16
like it's not that serious I like I'm

3149.099 --> 3155.2200000000003
just like kind of a pain wussy okay

3152.16 --> 3160.14
I'm sensitive and that includes to that

3155.22 --> 3161.819
sort of [ __ ] like pain really bothers me

3160.14 --> 3163.6189999999997
especially like

3161.819 --> 3166.859
oh

3163.619 --> 3167.6400000000003
muscle cramps relating to back and all

3166.859 --> 3170.04
that

3167.64 --> 3172.74
that's why I've developed a discipline

3170.04 --> 3176.16
for myself to avoid that

3172.74 --> 3178.2599999999998
but I guess that breaking my routine has

3176.16 --> 3182.1189999999997
made me

3178.26 --> 3182.119
not do that yesterday

3189.119 --> 3194.6600000000003
so yeah I'm gonna say it's it's my

3191.94 --> 3194.66
freaking rib

3194.94 --> 3200.4
because yeah every time I breathe

3198.96 --> 3203.4
feel it

3200.4 --> 3204.78
so yeah it's probably my rhythm I'll be

3203.4 --> 3207.42
all right guys

3204.78 --> 3210.599
it's just a nuisance a hot bath might be

3207.42 --> 3212.579
better yeah I don't have a bath if only

3210.599 --> 3214.7400000000002
hot bath men

3212.579 --> 3217.4
that would be amazing I haven't had one

3214.74 --> 3217.3999999999996
of those in

3218.76 --> 3221.6600000000003
five years

3222.96 --> 3227.2400000000002
but yeah I'll manage with the shower

3230.7 --> 3232.7
um

3239.7 --> 3244.5789999999997
all right but yeah I appreciate you guys

3241.92 --> 3244.579
don't worry

3247.2 --> 3253.2599999999998
I mean to be fair guys

3249.42 --> 3256.44
this is less of a nuisance than like

3253.26 --> 3259.98
a half a week ago being all tense and

3256.44 --> 3262.559
having to go to that was more disruptive

3259.98 --> 3264.66
to me like that really made me lose

3262.559 --> 3267.0
focus this is just like somebody's

3264.66 --> 3269.339
poking in my back constantly

3267.0 --> 3271.68
is really annoying and distractive

3269.339 --> 3273.0589999999997
especially like if you kind of forget

3271.68 --> 3274.7999999999997
about it

3273.059 --> 3277.02
that sort of thing

3274.8 --> 3279.9
that's less annoying than having like

3277.02 --> 3283.079
constant tension intolerance making you

3279.9 --> 3287.78
sick so I'm actually doing better than a

3283.079 --> 3287.78
week ago surprisingly enough ah

3291.66 --> 3297.0
avoid too much fat for a few days what

3295.44 --> 3300.42
no

3297.0 --> 3303.059
well too much yeah but I am I eat fat

3300.42 --> 3305.88
heavy overall and it's not giving me

3303.059 --> 3309.599
problems at all like it doesn't it's not

3305.88 --> 3313.02
like oh that's tough no not at all I'm

3309.599 --> 3315.0
used to like a lot of fat it's good for

3313.02 --> 3319.64
me actually

3315.0 --> 3319.64
so I yeah but thanks for the tips

3326.76 --> 3332.1600000000003
yeah Jose well you don't pay attention

3329.16 --> 3335.04
so yeah then you come to idiotic

3332.16 --> 3338.66
conclusions like that

3335.04 --> 3338.66
doesn't surprise me at all

3339.839 --> 3344.819
right not paying attention is a virtue

3342.66 --> 3347.04
that way you can uphold your stupid

3344.819 --> 3349.5
little flawed religion

3347.04 --> 3353.18
so yeah yeah there's no surprise here

3349.5 --> 3353.18
that you didn't pay attention

3358.2 --> 3360.74
ah

3376.02 --> 3380.119
high functioning autistic huh

3382.68 --> 3385.52
whoa

3391.859 --> 3396.7799999999997
all right

3393.96 --> 3399.66
well Matthew look when I got like Cuts

3396.78 --> 3402.42
or anything on my skin or whatever or

3399.66 --> 3404.64
even in a muscle that doesn't bother me

3402.42 --> 3405.9
too much either but when it comes to

3404.64 --> 3409.68
like back

3405.9 --> 3413.299
pain that bothers me a lot

3409.68 --> 3413.299
because there's a distinct difference

3422.4 --> 3427.88
is Jose new here no he's just he just

3425.04 --> 3427.88
doesn't pay attention

3427.98 --> 3433.7
he's just barely hearing things I guess

3446.88 --> 3449.599
ah

3452.119 --> 3456.2400000000002
oh Matthew ho Jose doesn't care if you

3455.04 --> 3458.7
hate on him

3456.24 --> 3461.0
or not he's going to be the way he is

3458.7 --> 3461.0
anyway

3461.64 --> 3466.52
so you don't have to get all apologetic

3469.799 --> 3475.339
say it as it is that that's the best you

3472.619 --> 3475.339
could do for him

3475.44 --> 3480.5
just a derp

3477.9 --> 3480.5
huh

3499.26 --> 3502.26
hmm

3506.099 --> 3512.059
yeah it is my rib

3508.559 --> 3512.059
yeah now we know for sure

3512.64 --> 3520.2799999999997
and I think that the Magnesium Citrate

3515.28 --> 3520.28
helped I can like I just felt like it

3520.5 --> 3525.5
ah

3521.9 --> 3525.5
it's still there

3529.319 --> 3534.7799999999997
but the like there's less passive

3532.26 --> 3537.2990000000004
pain radiation it's just now when I move

3534.78 --> 3539.4
error

3537.299 --> 3542.96
anyway enough about it

3539.4 --> 3542.96
what's going on out there

3577.44 --> 3579.619
thank you

3585.18 --> 3591.98
all right Matthew Hall thanks for for

3587.76 --> 3591.98
being in the chat I'll see you next time

3592.02 --> 3595.4
and yeah have a good meal

3612.0 --> 3617.099
huh

3613.799 --> 3619.74
that's so funny there's like these two

3617.099 --> 3621.839
green parrots wild parrots

3619.74 --> 3625.14
they're just sitting there in that tree

3621.839 --> 3627.9
and they've been sitting there all day

3625.14 --> 3631.46
so far I don't know why they're saying

3627.9 --> 3631.46
that's really unusual look

3644.46 --> 3649.7400000000002
I don't know if the camera can pick it

3646.68 --> 3651.7799999999997
up maybe just

3649.74 --> 3653.52
they're just sitting there on the left

3651.78 --> 3656.76
of the branch

3653.52 --> 3658.98
on the tree down here

3656.76 --> 3662.96
and they just they've been sitting there

3658.98 --> 3662.96
for like hours now

3663.18 --> 3665.72
weird

3705.78 --> 3710.76
your red Netherlands locked yeah I've

3708.96 --> 3713.7200000000003
read something like that too I don't

3710.76 --> 3713.7200000000003
know what's going on

3716.819 --> 3722.819
I just know there's like like

3719.94 --> 3725.78
serious dissatisfaction

3722.819 --> 3725.7799999999997
about it

3740.359 --> 3743.66
was this

3744.72 --> 3751.2799999999997
yeah an article

3747.78 --> 3751.28
or this what is it

3753.359 --> 3760.44
some Israeli American Nobel Prize winner

3757.44 --> 3763.02
says that the Netherlands has like the

3760.44 --> 3765.599
worst Corona approach

3763.02 --> 3769.579
resolution ever

3765.599 --> 3769.579
that's well yeah

3772.92 --> 3776.76
like I don't know how long it's going to

3774.78 --> 3780.299
persist but like this the missionary

3776.76 --> 3782.8190000000004
cabinet it's not even a real cabinet

3780.299 --> 3785.0389999999998
has been pushing it for a while now and

3782.819 --> 3788.16
I think that everybody's like almost

3785.039 --> 3792.0200000000004
ready to have them dragged out like okay

3788.16 --> 3792.02
and now you can [ __ ] off

3792.42 --> 3798.9
because everybody hates him

3796.2 --> 3804.14
it's like any people that were even like

3798.9 --> 3807.42
Pro vax before they're all like you suck

3804.14 --> 3810.839
you're idiots you're Liars

3807.42 --> 3811.859
you're literally contradict yourself on

3810.839 --> 3815.7599999999998
camera

3811.859 --> 3817.68
and we're sick of it you gotta get out

3815.76 --> 3819.7990000000004
so I I wonder how long it's going to

3817.68 --> 3819.799
last

3822.059 --> 3828.7200000000003
but I didn't I I kind of just ignore it

3826.14 --> 3830.7
like I don't care what they say I'm

3828.72 --> 3832.9199999999996
gonna do what I'm gonna do and I don't

3830.7 --> 3834.96
care

3832.92 --> 3838.6800000000003
and I think I'm not the only one I think

3834.96 --> 3841.559
that probably the majority by now is

3838.68 --> 3844.0389999999998
like so sick of this and they say even

3841.559 --> 3847.559
like oh yeah this

3844.039 --> 3851.099
87 or something like that there's all

3847.559 --> 3852.3590000000004
facts top and no it's a lie it's not

3851.099 --> 3855.48
even true

3852.359 --> 3857.22
no it isn't it's all lies they're just

3855.48 --> 3858.9
blabber they're like

3857.22 --> 3861.7799999999997
CNN

3858.9 --> 3863.76
in the cabinet

3861.78 --> 3867.2400000000002
that's what they're like now they're

3863.76 --> 3869.099
just straight out nonsensical [ __ ]

3867.24 --> 3871.9799999999996
lying

3869.099 --> 3875.94
and people are sick of it

3871.98 --> 3878.119
like they're really sick of it out here

3875.94 --> 3878.119
foreign

3901.74 --> 3905.7
you want everybody to go to heaven well

3904.02 --> 3907.68
screw that

3905.7 --> 3909.72
it's none of your damn business good

3907.68 --> 3911.5789999999997
servant why don't you take care of

3909.72 --> 3913.4399999999996
yourself

3911.579 --> 3915.0
why don't you get ready to go to heaven

3913.44 --> 3920.039
first yeah

3915.0 --> 3922.14
you can't make others do that you can't

3920.039 --> 3924.8390000000004
you can only provide them with an

3922.14 --> 3928.5
opportunity to long for pulling

3924.839 --> 3930.18
everybody in is ridiculous and a waste

3928.5 --> 3932.64
of your time and energy

3930.18 --> 3935.7599999999998
why don't you just focus on you getting

3932.64 --> 3938.4
there yeah you're not there yet

3935.76 --> 3939.38
you still got a lot of issues with

3938.4 --> 3942.6600000000003
yourself

3939.38 --> 3945.539
misconceptions foolish beliefs why don't

3942.66 --> 3947.7
you work on that first before you gush

3945.539 --> 3948.96
all over like I want to save everyone

3947.7 --> 3952.799
dude

3948.96 --> 3956.88
like not even Jesus wanted that you get

3952.799 --> 3961.02
it Jesus himself wasn't even like that

3956.88 --> 3963.44
so why don't you drop the gushing and

3961.02 --> 3963.44
get real

3964.2 --> 3970.5
yeah you know well do something about it

3967.46 --> 3973.799
recognize your feelings are ridiculous

3970.5 --> 3976.5
not productive not effective they're not

3973.799 --> 3979.68
going to lead to anything real it's just

3976.5 --> 3981.66
a foolish dream and Foolish Dreams don't

3979.68 --> 3987.5989999999997
help anybody

3981.66 --> 3990.42
get it Foolish Dreams don't help anybody

3987.599 --> 3993.92
they're not gonna make

3990.42 --> 3993.92
the world like that

4003.5 --> 4008.42
yeah well you love your friend well you

4005.9 --> 4010.1600000000003
don't have to be sorry about that hey if

4008.42 --> 4011.0
you want to help your friends that's

4010.16 --> 4014.42
cool

4011.0 --> 4017.68
don't say everybody

4014.42 --> 4017.6800000000003
that's [ __ ]

4019.46 --> 4026.319
that's just [ __ ] just yeah of course

4021.74 --> 4026.319
you want the people you're close to

4027.26 --> 4031.28
you want that for them that's completely

4029.359 --> 4032.96
understandable and that's reasonable

4031.28 --> 4036.02
right

4032.96 --> 4038.299
although you gotta like yeah it has

4036.02 --> 4041.42
consequences like when they ABS

4038.299 --> 4043.819
absolutely reject you

4041.42 --> 4045.26
you can't do anything about it right are

4043.819 --> 4047.96
they still going to be your friends even

4045.26 --> 4049.46
if they like become total Devils that's

4047.96 --> 4054.2
up to you

4049.46 --> 4055.46
but to just say everybody no no no no no

4054.2 --> 4059.4399999999996
no

4055.46 --> 4059.44
that's not gonna work ever

4060.859 --> 4065.92
right like this guy here in chat

4063.74 --> 4065.9199999999996
foreign

4068.42 --> 4072.579
you're not going to help him get to

4070.28 --> 4072.579
heaven

4073.88 --> 4078.38
he's an idiot

4075.92 --> 4081.28
he doesn't even have the senses to

4078.38 --> 4081.28
perceive heaven

4107.719 --> 4113.839
right this this idea that it's so easy

4111.739 --> 4116.0599999999995
all you have to do is chant this little

4113.839 --> 4118.58
thing you can go to heaven is absolutely

4116.06 --> 4121.64
it's a Ponzi scheme

4118.58 --> 4122.9
it's a Ponzi scheme one of the oldest in

4121.64 --> 4126.38
the world

4122.9 --> 4130.239
and if you buy it you're delusional and

4126.38 --> 4130.2390000000005
you're going to be sorely disappointed

4130.46 --> 4134.14
yeah it's not easy

4137.239 --> 4140.419999999999
right

4138.339 --> 4142.339
this place

4140.42 --> 4147.279
especially if you go by the cathar

4142.339 --> 4147.2789999999995
knowledge and I take it's very old

4149.299 --> 4155.42
right it's not easy to escape hell

4155.48 --> 4160.8189999999995
it's not easy to do that whether you

4158.6 --> 4164.719
believe that their ritual approach and

4160.819 --> 4167.299
like how to do that is real or not the

4164.719 --> 4170.06
mere recognition that it is hell and

4167.299 --> 4171.92
it's not easy to escape if you if you

4170.06 --> 4172.88
stick to the Earthly if you love the

4171.92 --> 4175.64
Earthly

4172.88 --> 4177.9800000000005
then you will according to the cathars

4175.64 --> 4180.1990000000005
reincarnate

4177.98 --> 4182.178999999999
and you have to start over again until

4180.199 --> 4185.48
you finally

4182.179 --> 4189.08
are ready to actually go there and let

4185.48 --> 4191.9
this all go like really Let It Go

4189.08 --> 4194.679
and that includes care whether others go

4191.9 --> 4194.679
to heaven or not

4195.38 --> 4203.7390000000005
because it's a huge deal

4199.159 --> 4203.739
it's super hard to escape

4204.14 --> 4209.7390000000005
and I think that's actually much more

4206.6 --> 4209.7390000000005
reasonable approach

4215.96 --> 4218.679
uh

4225.699 --> 4231.199
that's just this [ __ ] trolls get the

4228.56 --> 4233.900000000001
[ __ ] out nobody cares what you

4231.199 --> 4236.36
blabbering [ __ ] have to say nobody

4233.9 --> 4238.4
cares you are not productive you're not

4236.36 --> 4241.339999999999
even trying to develop your own thinking

4238.4 --> 4244.46
you're just trying to ruin what other

4241.34 --> 4248.14
people do because you live in hell

4244.46 --> 4248.14
and you will never get out

4248.3 --> 4251.14
Frankie

4257.42 --> 4260.8
it will last

4270.83 --> 4273.909
[Music]

4275.719 --> 4283.159
all right good servant I recommend you

4279.739 --> 4285.739
actually look into the cathars the

4283.159 --> 4289.099999999999
knowledge that is left of them

4285.739 --> 4291.799999999999
and don't just like say oh I'm going to

4289.1 --> 4295.34
erase it and then copy this don't do

4291.8 --> 4296.96
that but actually think about it

4295.34 --> 4301.04
carefully

4296.96 --> 4305.9
take the time don't let your emotions

4301.04 --> 4308.6
make decisions just look into that

4305.9 --> 4311.599999999999
look into how they

4308.6 --> 4316.780000000001
performed their Christianity and what

4311.6 --> 4316.780000000001
their existential spiritual goals were

4317.54 --> 4323.0199999999995
there's a whole bunch of things we can

4319.64 --> 4323.02
all learn from them

4324.32 --> 4329.12
because I think that their overall

4326.179 --> 4332.06
Outlook even on esoterics and the

4329.12 --> 4334.04
spiritual is much more realistic than

4332.06 --> 4336.64
like well the Catholic roots of

4334.04 --> 4336.64
Christianity

4342.679 --> 4347.4800000000005
Dutch why

4345.5 --> 4349.9
what so nobody can understand what I'm

4347.48 --> 4349.9
saying

4362.54 --> 4365.86
what's the point

4367.34 --> 4371.2390000000005
I mean maybe if service day was still

4369.5 --> 4373.58
here and Chad I would

4371.239 --> 4375.86
start talking Dutch because at least

4373.58 --> 4378.44
somebody would get it

4375.86 --> 4380.599999999999
I'm not just gonna talk to nobody just

4378.44 --> 4383.739
because of the sound of how it sounds

4380.6 --> 4383.7390000000005
it's no

4386.239 --> 4390.639999999999
I'm not like a carnival ride

4400.34 --> 4405.5
oh well you have to pay hey I I hadn't

4403.1 --> 4409.900000000001
made that offer yet

4405.5 --> 4409.9
but yeah sure I don't know

4410.06 --> 4415.159000000001
maybe for a slight PayPal donation I'll

4413.06 --> 4418.219
say something

4415.159 --> 4420.82
if you insist

4418.219 --> 4420.82
but

4420.98 --> 4425.659
no I don't even want to do that

4424.28 --> 4429.639999999999
I mean

4425.659 --> 4429.639999999999
no no conditional donations

4436.52 --> 4441.040000000001
all right David Davey little

4442.28 --> 4448.5199999999995
I mean like yeah dude I could do just a

4446.179 --> 4450.9800000000005
complete Dutch Hangout

4448.52 --> 4453.9800000000005
but that's not the early bird show the

4450.98 --> 4455.9
early bird show is English spoken

4453.98 --> 4456.98
but yeah there are Dutch people out

4455.9 --> 4458.78
there

4456.98 --> 4462.62
like Roger

4458.78 --> 4465.0199999999995
hangs around in sky in the Discord a lot

4462.62 --> 4466.58
for example East Dutch

4465.02 --> 4469.34
and

4466.58 --> 4472.1
some other guys too but like he's more

4469.34 --> 4474.62
like a really active flat earther

4472.1 --> 4476.96
so yeah I can I can have a Dutch

4474.62 --> 4479.36
conversation

4476.96 --> 4482.0
but I'm not just gonna speak Dutch here

4479.36 --> 4485.239
on my own when nobody in chat even

4482.0 --> 4487.48
speaks Dutch that's just pointless

4485.239 --> 4487.48
foreign

4493.36 --> 4498.82
spoke too soon I think it's getting a

4496.46 --> 4498.82
little better

4516.679 --> 4520.9
all right so good servant are you still

4518.659 --> 4520.9
there

4525.98 --> 4530.78
I'm gonna

4527.36 --> 4535.54
link you up with that video I want you

4530.78 --> 4535.54
to watch it serious are you still there

4554.659 --> 4563.62
ah right okay so yeah

4559.1 --> 4563.620000000001
check out this video take your time

4565.28 --> 4571.46
try not to

4567.5 --> 4574.28
either super embrace it or reject it

4571.46 --> 4576.32
just actually pay attention

4574.28 --> 4579.44
I know you have some steep condition

4576.32 --> 4582.38
with your form of Christianity

4579.44 --> 4586.48
but I think it would do you good if you

4582.38 --> 4586.4800000000005
actually looked into this

4592.219 --> 4598.28
takes you seriously no that's nonsense

4596.239 --> 4600.139999999999
oh you're going to retract that message

4598.28 --> 4602.48
get the [ __ ] out

4600.14 --> 4604.88
it's ridiculous A lot of people have

4602.48 --> 4607.04
like get

4604.88 --> 4610.28
they sleep they sleep in a slightly

4607.04 --> 4613.219
wrong position and then their back hurts

4610.28 --> 4615.92
a lot of people get that

4613.219 --> 4617.84
like that is how you typically get back

4615.92 --> 4621.08
issues like that

4617.84 --> 4624.58
it's not uncommon it's ridiculous has

4621.08 --> 4624.58
nothing to do with laziness

4636.26 --> 4643.88
all right good servant so will you take

4639.26 --> 4645.56
a look maybe you could like do a show

4643.88 --> 4648.679
later

4645.56 --> 4651.02
and basically talk about it talk about

4648.679 --> 4653.4800000000005
what you learned in there I would

4651.02 --> 4656.56
actually tune into that show and really

4653.48 --> 4656.5599999999995
I'm really curious

4656.659 --> 4662.179
like what

4658.699 --> 4664.879999999999
what you will feel about it

4662.179 --> 4666.86
it better not be just standard chanting

4664.88 --> 4668.900000000001
response that would be really annoying

4666.86 --> 4671.839999999999
and would be kind of evidence to me that

4668.9 --> 4673.339999999999
you completely ignored everything

4671.84 --> 4677.56
right

4673.34 --> 4677.56
but I am very curious as to

4679.699 --> 4684.46
yeah how you wouldn't respond other than

4681.86 --> 4684.46
enchanting

4690.5 --> 4695.06
you've pulled my back out just trying to

4692.659 --> 4697.099999999999
stand out oh that sucks yeah you got to

4695.06 --> 4699.52
be careful

4697.1 --> 4699.52
right

4700.04 --> 4703.84
like things like lifting

4706.4 --> 4712.159
if you like lift with your back not with

4708.38 --> 4714.26
legs this is a classic classic mistake

4712.159 --> 4716.239
lots of people get back injuries

4714.26 --> 4717.08
sometimes even really serious because of

4716.239 --> 4719.178999999999
that

4717.08 --> 4722.36
but it can also happen when you're just

4719.179 --> 4724.52
you go to bed sleeping or you're like

4722.36 --> 4726.38
even especially when you're like in a

4724.52 --> 4730.540000000001
rush to get to sleep

4726.38 --> 4730.54
I have to wake up early on then

4731.12 --> 4737.96
you don't yeah you don't fully just

4733.94 --> 4740.12
relax and make sure everything is

4737.96 --> 4741.92
smooth and all that and then you can

4740.12 --> 4744.86
just fall asleep in the wrong position

4741.92 --> 4749.26
and then you wake up all sore and like

4744.86 --> 4749.259999999999
ah yeah that's that happens

4760.58 --> 4762.76
foreign

4769.4 --> 4773.42
I'm going to take a two minute break

4771.02 --> 4776.42
I'll be back

4773.42 --> 4776.42
okay

4789.98 --> 4792.759999999999
foreign

4804.199 --> 4806.32
thank you

4861.24 --> 4863.739
[Music]

4861.739 --> 4863.739
um

4865.96 --> 4870.86
and get contained yeah

4894.139 --> 4897.82
wow our time has flown

4916.34 --> 4919.34
foreign

4964.4 --> 4969.638999999999
a random Explorer I've seen you in a

4967.58 --> 4969.639
while

4973.159 --> 4977.5599999999995
oh

4975.02 --> 4977.56
cool

4983.3 --> 4988.04
hope I feel better well I'm all right

4985.52 --> 4990.679
Jeff cassette it's just

4988.04 --> 4993.0199999999995
I thought at first like oh no my organs

4990.679 --> 4996.08
or something that was worrisome it's I

4993.02 --> 4997.580000000001
think I'm pretty sure it's just a rip

4996.08 --> 5001.719
like

4997.58 --> 5004.84
if it was Oregon it would still be very

5001.719 --> 5007.2390000000005
sore right now and it's already died

5004.84 --> 5010.6
down significantly

5007.239 --> 5013.138999999999
since it started the show so it's just a

5010.6 --> 5013.139
nuisance

5015.1 --> 5021.159000000001
especially because I can constantly want

5017.98 --> 5024.299999999999
to stretch or yawn but every time I do

5021.159 --> 5024.299999999999
it it hurts

5029.86 --> 5040.62
ow Jesus yeah definitely rib definitely

5034.96 --> 5040.62
and I could literally like feel the out

5040.78 --> 5043.78
foreign

5045.04 --> 5050.0199999999995
but it'll probably be gone tomorrow

5047.92 --> 5051.9400000000005
because it doesn't take too long

5050.02 --> 5053.5
especially if I'm going to take a shower

5051.94 --> 5055.659
and I will

5053.5 --> 5057.28
uh

5055.659 --> 5060.48
I'll be right

5057.28 --> 5060.48
don't worry about me guys

5061.78 --> 5068.639
but yeah

5064.06 --> 5068.639
I I can still use PayPal donations

5071.62 --> 5076.84
I'm not even sure if I'm gonna get any

5073.9 --> 5079.0599999999995
on Monday would be handy though

5076.84 --> 5082.0
because I lit I don't even have like

5079.06 --> 5086.02
french fries anymore at this point

5082.0 --> 5089.32
like I only got like dinner meal and

5086.02 --> 5091.540000000001
that can last like two three days

5089.32 --> 5094.659
but that's like the only thing I have I

5091.54 --> 5096.34
don't even have bread now

5094.659 --> 5097.9
I still have the peanut butter I just

5096.34 --> 5100.2390000000005
don't have bread

5097.9 --> 5103.299999999999
donut french fries I don't have eggs

5100.239 --> 5106.62
it's weird I don't have any packages of

5103.3 --> 5109.42
soup left I do still have like bouillon

5106.62 --> 5112.659
blocks so I guess I could still get some

5109.42 --> 5114.159
but I've never been this depleted in

5112.659 --> 5118.839999999999
food before

5114.159 --> 5121.92
uh well stop doing that yeah but ah

5118.84 --> 5121.92
it's in Stick

5123.159 --> 5127.239
now how much I do like Str like

5125.44 --> 5130.239
stretching and all that on my shows

5127.239 --> 5131.86
because it just keeps me fluid

5130.239 --> 5134.199
so it's just my instinct telling you

5131.86 --> 5138.159
you're like yeah it's stuck you gotta do

5134.199 --> 5140.638999999999
that and then it's like oh damn it

5138.159 --> 5140.638999999999
oh

5148.3 --> 5151.3
foreign

5158.82 --> 5162.9
wood for weeks wow

5163.6 --> 5167.860000000001
well

5164.739 --> 5170.0199999999995
that's great right

5167.86 --> 5173.94
that means you got

5170.02 --> 5173.9400000000005
a firewood isn't that's great

5174.159 --> 5177.299999999999
uh at least G

5185.02 --> 5190.659000000001
there you go doing sit again yeah I know

5188.02 --> 5193.02
it's Instinct it's really tough not to

5190.659 --> 5193.0199999999995
do it

5195.659 --> 5202.0
it's roughly comparable to like

5199.54 --> 5205.3
my stretching could be like considered

5202.0 --> 5208.179
like transforming in a Transformer and

5205.3 --> 5211.179
there's something stuck so it's like

5208.179 --> 5211.179
no

5218.5 --> 5225.1
if you don't move maybe it'll get

5221.199 --> 5226.62
maybe it'll get good point it might

5225.1 --> 5229.780000000001
I mean

5226.62 --> 5231.82
blood flow eventually you gotta keep

5229.78 --> 5234.699
that in mind right so if there is like a

5231.82 --> 5236.44
muscle thing wrong it's gonna get a

5234.699 --> 5238.78
little swollen

5236.44 --> 5240.82
and that's gonna cause the nuisance well

5238.78 --> 5242.86
the only thing that really gets it away

5240.82 --> 5246.099999999999
is blood flow

5242.86 --> 5250.36
so yeah moving around even though it's a

5246.1 --> 5254.46
nuisance eventually actually helps

5250.36 --> 5254.46
as long as you don't like force it

5255.76 --> 5261.1
stand up and touch my toes

5258.82 --> 5263.88
uh

5261.1 --> 5263.88
huh

5264.159 --> 5267.879999999999
that's interesting I might actually try

5266.44 --> 5270.339999999999
that

5267.88 --> 5274.1990000000005
see if I could do that

5270.34 --> 5274.1990000000005
I hope it doesn't get worse though

5275.02 --> 5278.76
okay that doesn't hurt at all actually

5281.08 --> 5285.46
that makes me

5282.699 --> 5288.879999999999
feel very little it's rather the other

5285.46 --> 5293.32
way around when I try to

5288.88 --> 5295.9800000000005
stretch the other way is Planet Earths

5293.32 --> 5295.98
huh

5308.98 --> 5315.82
a heating pad that's I don't have any

5311.98 --> 5317.86
but wait I do have like a water

5315.82 --> 5319.96
thing

5317.86 --> 5323.44
interesting

5319.96 --> 5326.88
you'll be fine yeah I know I'll be fine

5323.44 --> 5326.879999999999
it's just a nuisance

5345.94 --> 5349.599999999999
yeah Mike's yeah the heating pad's a

5347.98 --> 5352.0599999999995
good idea but I don't have those

5349.6 --> 5354.58
unfortunately

5352.06 --> 5357.2390000000005
not like with the Cherry pit

5354.58 --> 5357.239
cherry

5357.699 --> 5360.419999999999
things

5361.3 --> 5366.96
but I'm just going to take a hot shower

5363.58 --> 5366.96
that should do the trick too

5368.44 --> 5373.178999999999
and then maybe a quick nap and there's a

5370.36 --> 5376.08
great likelihood if I do that it'll like

5373.179 --> 5376.08
reset itself

5398.86 --> 5401.86
foreign

5416.26 --> 5423.04
so yeah this is kind of stupid it's like

5420.52 --> 5424.900000000001
half the show filled with me about oh my

5423.04 --> 5428.32
back

5424.9 --> 5430.48
it's not the best of shows when it's

5428.32 --> 5434.58
like that but yeah it's so distracting

5430.48 --> 5434.58
you know it's hard to get away from that

5434.92 --> 5437.76
uh

5439.48 --> 5444.339999999999
but I guess that I

5441.82 --> 5446.5599999999995
part of the early bird show is also just

5444.34 --> 5449.56
talking about common ailments and what

5446.56 --> 5454.860000000001
to do Etc because yeah people

5449.56 --> 5454.860000000001
do find themselves in such situations so

5455.8 --> 5458.159000000001
right

5461.32 --> 5464.94
I guess it serves a function

5480.699 --> 5484.36
all right so yeah

5483.159 --> 5487.0
I'm

5484.36 --> 5488.139
I'm gonna probably round out the show

5487.0 --> 5490.239
soon

5488.139 --> 5492.219
still wanted to ask you guys all of you

5490.239 --> 5493.78
guys though what are you doing for

5492.219 --> 5494.92
Christmas

5493.78 --> 5499.679
like

5494.92 --> 5499.679
are you still gonna visit families or

5510.639 --> 5513.719
what are you gonna do

5529.3 --> 5533.62
I mean I'm still gonna visit my dad if

5531.88 --> 5536.4400000000005
everything is all right

5533.62 --> 5539.139
I mean we've been doing that since I've

5536.44 --> 5541.419999999999
moved in here

5539.139 --> 5544.62
I'm kind of looking forward to it I

5541.42 --> 5544.62
haven't seen my dad in a while

5546.88 --> 5551.5
although we haven't like officially

5548.92 --> 5553.719
talked about it just yet but yeah even

5551.5 --> 5556.0
like last year too it was like

5553.719 --> 5560.4
called me up about it like just a week

5556.0 --> 5560.4
before that or even a few days

5561.94 --> 5566.638999999999
it's not like I'm gonna have any other

5564.04 --> 5566.639
plans

5586.78 --> 5592.44
or

5588.159 --> 5592.44
or we did just don't talk about it

5593.139 --> 5598.62
for four minutes and then I'm gonna

5595.78 --> 5598.62
round out the show

5599.5 --> 5604.06
been going for over one and a half hours

5601.659 --> 5605.86
so I guess I could just round out the

5604.06 --> 5608.34
show then

5605.86 --> 5608.339999999999
right

5610.54 --> 5615.6
visiting friends no worries about

5612.94 --> 5615.599999999999
all right

5621.34 --> 5623.9400000000005
oh

5624.94 --> 5629.678999999999
that sounds interesting at least she ice

5628.36 --> 5632.159
skating

5629.679 --> 5632.159
hmm

5636.58 --> 5641.8
right the good on you David little

5639.04 --> 5645.9
nobody should like at this point

5641.8 --> 5649.06
like government should be entirely

5645.9 --> 5652.96
entirely ignored concerning all this

5649.06 --> 5655.780000000001
it's like no keep on blabbering like a

5652.96 --> 5658.4800000000005
bunch of CNN with supposed power

5655.78 --> 5660.46
and go [ __ ] yourself because we are just

5658.48 --> 5663.759999999999
gonna do what we do what we've always

5660.46 --> 5665.94
done and you're not gonna take it from

5663.76 --> 5665.9400000000005
us

5667.48 --> 5672.218999999999
and we're not going to inform you about

5670.239 --> 5676.419999999999
anything either

5672.219 --> 5678.639
just gonna go no registry no reporting

5676.42 --> 5680.8
no telling

5678.639 --> 5684.1
anybody

5680.8 --> 5686.4400000000005
just do it and go screw them

5684.1 --> 5689.7390000000005
right oh what they're they're gonna go

5686.44 --> 5692.379999999999
by every single house

5689.739 --> 5694.78
every single house in your country and

5692.38 --> 5698.52
then just start pulling people out you

5694.78 --> 5698.5199999999995
don't have authority to dude

5698.92 --> 5703.3
like they don't even have the manpower

5701.08 --> 5706.3
to do that

5703.3 --> 5709.719
everybody just goes

5706.3 --> 5713.4400000000005
to their family to friends and as a good

5709.719 --> 5717.4800000000005
Christmas just do it screw them just do

5713.44 --> 5717.48
it everybody does it they can't stop you

5723.1 --> 5730.719
like and don't even be nervous about it

5725.8 --> 5733.78
just literally take the time

5730.719 --> 5737.38
go to the moment of Christmas and just

5733.78 --> 5740.619
literally forget they even exist it's

5737.38 --> 5742.3
like yeah this Christmas government

5740.619 --> 5745.0599999999995
doesn't exist

5742.3 --> 5749.26
I'm gonna 100 ignore it I'm not gonna

5745.06 --> 5751.2390000000005
turn on any news channel nothing

5749.26 --> 5752.92
just gonna have Chris's with my family

5751.239 --> 5755.619
or my friends

5752.92 --> 5756.76
and yeah government doesn't exist this

5755.619 --> 5759.78
Christmas

5756.76 --> 5759.780000000001
how about that

5767.44 --> 5772.839999999999
right and on that note I am gonna round

5769.9 --> 5774.5199999999995
out so thanks everyone for coming I hope

5772.84 --> 5777.659000000001
you like this show

5774.52 --> 5777.659000000001
I know it was a little

5778.619 --> 5786.46
oh crap cranky old are we yeah whatever

5784.119 --> 5789.639
there were interesting subjects

5786.46 --> 5793.119
discussed too in between all that

5789.639 --> 5795.34
mainly this whole

5793.119 --> 5798.4
southern France situation and it was

5795.34 --> 5799.96
interesting too because xiaom Benjamin

5798.4 --> 5802.0
yesterday

5799.96 --> 5803.92
it was no not yesterday I think it was

5802.0 --> 5806.44
Friday Also

5803.92 --> 5808.96
is addressing it so I don't know where

5806.44 --> 5812.08
he got that whether we both are getting

5808.96 --> 5814.719
it from same sources that it's just now

5812.08 --> 5816.58
happening out there or maybe he caught

5814.719 --> 5818.619
it from me it's a little weird when it

5816.58 --> 5819.94
happens right because I stream earlier

5818.619 --> 5822.159
than he does

5819.94 --> 5824.5599999999995
it's really weird to find out that on

5822.159 --> 5827.98
the same day he basically

5824.56 --> 5831.06
like cut into the same pie

5827.98 --> 5835.599999999999
that's weird when I find that out

5831.06 --> 5837.76
but it's cool it's a very interesting

5835.6 --> 5839.56
piece of research

5837.76 --> 5841.2390000000005
right it's very interesting to dig into

5839.56 --> 5843.400000000001
this and I'm

5841.239 --> 5844.718999999999
ready for more

5843.4 --> 5847.96
like

5844.719 --> 5850.5
what's going on in southern France like

5847.96 --> 5850.5
is that

5850.78 --> 5857.639
is that where actually a lot of the the

5853.78 --> 5857.639
biblical things really happened

5857.92 --> 5864.34
or is that like the retreat place where

5861.699 --> 5866.86
after Christ died that's where they all

5864.34 --> 5869.7390000000005
went and that's where it all continued

5866.86 --> 5872.5
because it's all kind of a big mystery

5869.739 --> 5876.339999999999
like a lot of it has been like erased

5872.5 --> 5879.4
like politically erased like

5876.34 --> 5882.9400000000005
scrapped out and ridiculous excuse

5879.4 --> 5886.599999999999
stories like this crazy story about the

5882.94 --> 5888.58
qatars had these amazing castles

5886.6 --> 5890.7390000000005
I'm not sure like if they were star

5888.58 --> 5892.78
forts but it could be that they actually

5890.739 --> 5895.718999999999
had the star forts

5892.78 --> 5898.0
and then this ridiculous story in

5895.719 --> 5900.58
response to that after they were all

5898.0 --> 5902.08
killed like Yeah The Nobles took over

5900.58 --> 5903.88
the castles

5902.08 --> 5906.28
and were destroyed then they rebuilt

5903.88 --> 5908.56
them then they ran out of money

5906.28 --> 5911.04
so they blew them up

5908.56 --> 5914.5
like

5911.04 --> 5916.54
you have to be a peon [ __ ] to believe

5914.5 --> 5919.48
that and yeah there were a lot of peon

5916.54 --> 5922.659
retards in those times but it's just

5919.48 --> 5925.9
looking back at it's such a ridiculous

5922.659 --> 5928.119
excuse so a lot has happened

5925.9 --> 5929.138999999999
in the southern of France the south of

5928.119 --> 5932.799999999999
France

5929.139 --> 5933.88
that is quite significant and yeah it's

5932.8 --> 5937.0
being

5933.88 --> 5939.0
slowly but steadily uncovered it's been

5937.0 --> 5942.04
like that for a while

5939.0 --> 5944.08
and I'm ready to dig into it and I think

5942.04 --> 5946.6
a whole bunch of people are it's going

5944.08 --> 5950.8
to be interesting

5946.6 --> 5953.280000000001
so yeah I'll keep you updated

5950.8 --> 5953.28
right

5955.54 --> 5961.119
