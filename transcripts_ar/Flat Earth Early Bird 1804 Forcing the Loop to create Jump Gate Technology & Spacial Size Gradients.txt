81.04 --> 88.60000000000001
yesterday weather does not

84.36 --> 92.079
suck today it's really wind still it's

88.6 --> 95.119
still kind of Cl cloudy but it's not a

92.079 --> 95.119
big gray soup or

95.159 --> 98.88000000000001
anything seems rather

100.32 --> 107.119
dry although it did there's still

103.079 --> 107.119
puddles around from last

109.479 --> 115.92
night and there's some sh sun coming

113.04 --> 118.2
through the clouds somehow I don't know

115.92 --> 121.96000000000001
but it looks like it might just clear up

118.2 --> 123.56
later down the day we'll see don't have

121.96 --> 128.84
to go

123.56 --> 132.44
anywhere all right so hello x 320 it's

164.48 --> 170.599
[Music]

167.44 --> 172.68
morning you saw one of my videos old one

170.599 --> 175.72
full of energy

172.68 --> 178.72
looked looked happy and

175.72 --> 178.72
all

178.76 --> 183.39999999999998
okay

180.28 --> 185.68
right well x320 yeah I mean those days

183.4 --> 188.799
have not all gone or

185.68 --> 192.44
anything actually I think on

188.799 --> 195.799
average yeah maybe less spontaneous

192.44 --> 197.72
happiness and all that but I think my

195.799 --> 202.08
overall attitude

197.72 --> 206.92
has improved on average I'd say anyway

202.08 --> 206.92000000000002
hello LSG steamy traveler and Richard

208.68 --> 212.15900000000002
G

210.599 --> 213.79899999999998
right I just

212.159 --> 217.12
overslept

213.799 --> 220.12
again worse actually than

217.12 --> 220.12
yesterday

224.08 --> 229.76000000000002
H it was one of those cases where I

226.799 --> 233.56
thought like oh yeah I'll get up soon

229.76 --> 237.2
and then I went into a deep Dream by

233.56 --> 241.0
accident I fell deeper into sleep yeah

237.2 --> 244.76
and then it like you wake up two hours

241.0 --> 244.76
later instead of one hour

247.51 --> 251.64
[Music]

248.799 --> 254.079
later

251.64 --> 256.28
anyway got banned from the QE channel

254.079 --> 259.279
for no Reas well that's too bad duper

256.28 --> 261.35999999999996
there's nothing I can do about

259.279 --> 264.44
[Music]

261.36 --> 266.96000000000004
it they just don't like you they don't

264.44 --> 271.6
trust you they think you're some kind of

266.96 --> 271.59999999999997
infiltrate or Troll and uh what

271.88 --> 274.36
is there

279.8 --> 286.32
loss right how are you all doing anyway

282.759 --> 289.72
I got an Illuminati croissant

286.32 --> 291.29
here weren't you like a big fan of them

289.72 --> 292.8
that

291.29 --> 297.8
[Music]

292.8 --> 297.8
x320 all right so uh got one right

298.56 --> 307.08
here

301.0 --> 307.08
hey ter 306 good to see you

315.24 --> 320.36
Tommy 14 different yeah Tommy now

323.52 --> 329.71999999999997
that's that makes me think you're

325.84 --> 332.88
probably real but I mean I don't think

329.72 --> 337.0
you've been around here for that long

332.88 --> 340.479
uh it's not really that odd that people

337.0 --> 343.72
here think the newcomer

340.479 --> 345.52
is all these different people because

343.72 --> 350.03900000000004
those different people have been like

345.52 --> 353.19899999999996
trying to infiltrate this place a lot

350.039 --> 355.639
and I mean a lot so

353.199 --> 357.16
excuse the chat members if they're a

355.639 --> 358.479
little little paranoid it's kind of

357.16 --> 361.47900000000004
tough to deal

358.479 --> 361.479
with

363.039 --> 366.88
anyway hello orle

367.319 --> 370.319
wble

387.479 --> 395.28
H and are then before you started yet oh

392.4 --> 395.28
you ate them

395.479 --> 401.28
before yeah I read it I don't it's not

398.68 --> 404.28000000000003
really properly constructed but I get

401.28 --> 405.88
you wanted to get an Illuminati kasan or

404.28 --> 409.31899999999996
a snack and you wanted to eat it but

405.88 --> 409.319
then I started late is

410.44 --> 418.4
that the third time now oh [ __ ] sorry

416.4 --> 420.4
Darren I

418.4 --> 422.19899999999996
mean

420.4 --> 423.79999999999995
what if I told you that it's probably

422.199 --> 425.72
going to happen tomorrow and then

423.8 --> 429.56
there's a good chance that I do actually

425.72 --> 432.319
get on time you know well it could

429.56 --> 435.759
happen it's like I'd like to say like

432.319 --> 437.91900000000004
okay guys for the next week I'm just

435.759 --> 440.96000000000004
going to start my show at 2: p.m.

437.919 --> 443.96
Amsterdam time and have a short show why

440.96 --> 443.96
not

445.759 --> 451.56
but yeah then I might like my

449.4 --> 453.84
subconscious might be like oh screw you

451.56 --> 458.039
then I'm going to wake you up perfectly

453.84 --> 458.039
on time every time then if you say

460.599 --> 465.4
that you want to show in this nexts at

463.0 --> 465.4
the same

465.639 --> 473.96000000000004
time crisp

467.879 --> 473.96000000000004
noodles liy liy juice oh

475.72 --> 480.03900000000004
nice well sorry ter I couldn't help you

478.479 --> 482.75899999999996
with that today

480.039 --> 485.96
say I mean would it help if you just

482.759 --> 490.56
told you like you just save it just save

485.96 --> 490.56
it till 2 p.m. amam

492.96 --> 499.19899999999996
time or or maybe then your stuff will

495.72 --> 499.199
get cold or something I don't

500.65 --> 506.919
[Music]

502.56 --> 506.919
know cards of your card game

508.24 --> 514.5600000000001
what are you actually writing it down

511.36 --> 518.64
duper this card game idea of

514.56 --> 518.64
yours I mean you probably

519.49 --> 522.629
[Music]

524.88 --> 530.279
should coming call 15 minutes right okay

528.6 --> 533.5600000000001
okay fair

530.279 --> 537.08
enough look tet I'm sorry I didn't know

533.56 --> 537.0799999999999
you were doing that by the way

538.04 --> 541.1999999999999
but yeah

541.29 --> 547.519
[Music]

543.92 --> 550.16
yeah now that I'm realizing you're doing

547.519 --> 551.87
that maybe that'll help to get me in

550.16 --> 553.279
time more or something I don't

551.87 --> 556.519
[Music]

553.279 --> 558.56
know it's just these winter days man I

556.519 --> 561.36
get

558.56 --> 562.959
weird I don't know it's my inner bear or

561.36 --> 564.0
something just makes me want to go to

562.959 --> 567.1999999999999
winter

564.0 --> 570.48
sleep it's like why what if I just don't

567.2 --> 574.1600000000001
get up for like six days

570.48 --> 576.9200000000001
like without eating or anything

574.16 --> 579.92
that probably not a good

576.92 --> 579.92
idea

582.57 --> 589.44
[Music]

585.32 --> 589.44
H hey clutch good to see

590.71 --> 593.879
[Music]

598.12 --> 601.12
you

601.48 --> 607.6
being respectful and silly by saying Mis

604.839 --> 611.24
yes I totally get that

607.6 --> 613.64
cut what you wrote down the rules and

611.24 --> 615.279
all the cards oh really

613.64 --> 619.88
is

615.279 --> 619.88
wow you got drawings for the cards

628.04 --> 633.4399999999999
too

630.0 --> 635.959
yeah ter no that's exactly what

633.44 --> 638.1600000000001
happens I mean I feel pretty energized

635.959 --> 638.16
right

643.399 --> 650.519
now although I I don't know maybe I'm

647.279 --> 652.8389999999999
experiencing time slower though I don't

650.519 --> 655.24
know I feel like everything is like

652.839 --> 656.9200000000001
getting happening really quickly but

655.24 --> 659.92
maybe that's just my Consciousness

656.92 --> 662.279
that's just at half speed or something

659.92 --> 662.279
I'm not

666.72 --> 670.76
sure good morning sir

675.44 --> 678.44
Arwin

682.2 --> 686.36
okay I didn't know I was a

687.959 --> 695.6389999999999
night respect oh I well I I feel

693.16 --> 700.48
honored if that is your intention behind

695.639 --> 700.48
it and if you're being silly that's fine

706.33 --> 710.5590000000001
[Music]

713.66 --> 718.4399999999999
[Music]

715.959 --> 720.6389999999999
too yeah by the way what have you been

718.44 --> 724.6
up to at Le I have not really heard a

720.639 --> 724.6
lot of what you've been doing

724.68 --> 727.76
recently last thing I heard was like

726.959 --> 732.2399999999999
these

727.76 --> 734.199
kittens again and with your dad and all

732.24 --> 739.519
that but

734.199 --> 739.519
uh like how's the new computer working

740.959 --> 746.56
out like have you like started to figure

744.72 --> 749.44
more things out or have you moved on to

746.56 --> 753.4399999999999
like other things like the out

749.44 --> 753.44
side maintenance and all

755.399 --> 762.839
that

757.92 --> 767.92
anyway I'm flat Earth royalty oh my God

762.839 --> 770.5600000000001
yes I was appointed by the Lord and Flat

767.92 --> 770.56
Earth

771.36 --> 776.04
royalty and you shall all address me as

774.519 --> 780.839
your

776.04 --> 780.8389999999999
highness no not really

786.96 --> 791.279
[Music]

792.0 --> 799.8
is Mark Sergeant Fe royalty well in that

795.839 --> 799.8000000000001
categorization system then

802.88 --> 812.0
yes I mean I like to think like yeah

806.68 --> 814.12
I'm a 2000 15 Awakening OG but I'm

812.0 --> 816.0
technically second wave dude but I have

814.12 --> 818.079
brought things to the table that I've

816.0 --> 821.399
really like

818.079 --> 823.8
kept pushing not just like oh here's my

821.399 --> 825.36
cool story I'm different and then just

823.8 --> 829.8
like leave it there

825.36 --> 833.6800000000001
and not develop it too much no I've got

829.8 --> 838.16
very dare I say radically alternative

833.68 --> 840.16
ideas about the nature of this place and

838.16 --> 842.759
I've really de I've pretty much

840.16 --> 842.759
developed

843.279 --> 849.12
them yeah until there's literally

845.759 --> 851.36
nothing else to figure out about how it

849.12 --> 851.36
could

852.36 --> 858.6
be right and especially with like

854.8 --> 860.639
looping and all that nonlinear looping

858.6 --> 864.44
like holy [ __ ] like the technically the

860.639 --> 865.72
possibilities are as wide as you can get

864.44 --> 868.1600000000001
so even

865.72 --> 869.839
like I I don't think I've actually

868.16 --> 873.0
talked about it on this show but I

869.839 --> 876.8000000000001
talked about it with

873.0 --> 878.56
clutch and Cold Springs Queen I think

876.8 --> 884.199
like at the end of the last time I was

878.56 --> 887.1199999999999
on like with the looping system that

884.199 --> 888.8389999999999
technically like the loop could have

887.12 --> 892.24
been like

888.839 --> 895.399
set that it wasn't there

892.24 --> 899.04
originally right so imagine like that it

895.399 --> 902.72
would be a dome like a dome like l Lally

899.04 --> 904.8389999999999
the classic Dome over Flat Earth and all

902.72 --> 908.759
that and maybe even a sort of an ice

904.839 --> 911.32
wall something but not like with the

908.759 --> 913.92
stuff the layout that we get to see in

911.32 --> 916.8000000000001
our typical projection because that's

913.92 --> 919.56
not of a consistent

916.8 --> 923.639
scale right

919.56 --> 926.6389999999999
but what if it actually was like take

923.639 --> 926.639
the

927.079 --> 931.3599999999999
uh the the

929.12 --> 933.199
rectangular looping map I'll just call

931.36 --> 936.04
it that it isn't that technically it's

933.199 --> 938.68
the the sideon projection where the

936.04 --> 942.279
equator is all straight lines on it

938.68 --> 946.68
right and everything parallel to

942.279 --> 950.56
that bat map what if that if you put

946.68 --> 952.199
that like and then a circle around that

950.56 --> 954.56
that's much

952.199 --> 957.199
bigger and then imagine that there's

954.56 --> 961.5999999999999
more land roughly

957.199 --> 964.68
there maybe and ocean and now imagine

961.6 --> 970.639
that inside of this bigger

964.68 --> 973.4799999999999
Circle a loop is set it's like a hole in

970.639 --> 979.44
space like a big circle just

973.48 --> 979.44
goes and suddenly it's looping

981.079 --> 986.4399999999999
interconnected so that there's basically

983.44 --> 989.36
other original space it connects to and

986.44 --> 992.12
that the loop might be secondary

989.36 --> 995.12
like so it's not like all the material

992.12 --> 998.279
and everything manifests and all that

995.12 --> 1002.36
and and God shapes

998.279 --> 1004.279
it and it was always looping right it

1002.36 --> 1007.519
might be like no the loop could have

1004.279 --> 1010.4399999999999
been set after it's all been

1007.519 --> 1012.279
created without any weird nonlinear

1010.44 --> 1014.2790000000001
situations so that it might have been

1012.279 --> 1017.48
like a secondary thing

1014.279 --> 1020.16
like another dimensional layer or

1017.48 --> 1024.039
another challenge to to it but I mean if

1020.16 --> 1026.0
there is a loop guys then one has to

1024.039 --> 1028.799
very seriously

1026.0 --> 1031.64
question this is logic this is pure

1028.799 --> 1034.16
pattern logic if there is a loop and it

1031.64 --> 1034.16
is like

1034.48 --> 1041.48
that we have to philosophically

1038.199 --> 1044.28
question the true nature of the globe

1041.48 --> 1049.2
Earth cosmology

1044.28 --> 1053.52
fantasy very seriously because if why

1049.2 --> 1053.52
would God set a

1056.32 --> 1064.6789999999999
loop the only logical conclusion would

1059.36 --> 1068.24
be to confuse us to what end well to

1064.679 --> 1071.3200000000002
imagine what this world is instead of

1068.24 --> 1073.28
flat I'm saying is that if it is looping

1071.32 --> 1075.3999999999999
like a tunnel and the equator is a

1073.28 --> 1080.3999999999999
perfect straight line looping in on

1075.4 --> 1080.4
itself that's almost made

1080.559 --> 1085.36
designed

1082.48 --> 1088.44
architected to give

1085.36 --> 1091.08
people that aren't High super bright

1088.44 --> 1094.24
that aren't super enlightened the

1091.08 --> 1097.0
impression that it must be a ball

1094.24 --> 1100.6
then cuz if you walk straight line on a

1097.0 --> 1100.6
ball you end up in the same

1102.28 --> 1108.3999999999999
place seriously this is a very

1105.679 --> 1110.5590000000002
serious philic philosophical con

1108.4 --> 1114.8400000000001
consideration like if there is a loop

1110.559 --> 1117.28
then the globe Earth must be

1114.84 --> 1121.36
like like a

1117.28 --> 1124.6789999999999
deliberate Challenge from God like not

1121.36 --> 1129.039
just Satan making up the the the

1124.679 --> 1133.1200000000001
opposite but a deliberate

1129.039 --> 1137.32
challenge that comes directly forth from

1133.12 --> 1139.52
the design that we find ourselves

1137.32 --> 1141.84
in

1139.52 --> 1144.8799999999999
maybe the a lot of you are getting like

1141.84 --> 1147.9599999999998
a really creepy feeling or something

1144.88 --> 1150.72
about this when I say that but this has

1147.96 --> 1153.64
been like it's part of the reason why

1150.72 --> 1156.08
I'm even like having this weird

1153.64 --> 1158.0800000000002
interpersonal relationship with Ballwin

1156.08 --> 1160.1589999999999
in my side myself

1158.08 --> 1165.08
it's

1160.159 --> 1167.64
like I truly believe in how I think the

1165.08 --> 1168.799
realm is with the looping I really think

1167.64 --> 1171.64
that

1168.799 --> 1176.799
and it makes sense

1171.64 --> 1179.679
that that the ball is like a deliberate

1176.799 --> 1183.4
challenging mind

1179.679 --> 1186.679
toy that can that will be the it will

1183.4 --> 1190.4
give them the people or it will give the

1186.679 --> 1193.3600000000001
devil metaphorically the domain of the

1190.4 --> 1195.52
ball because it is wrong it is a lie it

1193.36 --> 1197.84
is

1195.52 --> 1201.4
imaginary but it doesn't make the ball

1197.84 --> 1203.8799999999999
itself self evil it just makes it people

1201.4 --> 1206.3600000000001
that believe in it and deal with it more

1203.88 --> 1208.3200000000002
vulnerable to demonic influences which

1206.36 --> 1212.24
is very palpable

1208.32 --> 1215.039
to but it's not like if you believe it

1212.24 --> 1218.0
then you're automatically become a

1215.039 --> 1221.72
demon it just makes the chances of you

1218.0 --> 1225.84
dilapidating bigger because it's

1221.72 --> 1229.0
wrong but it's not just of the devil

1225.84 --> 1231.9599999999998
it's not just made to destroy our mind

1229.0 --> 1235.919
it's a challenge that's like

1231.96 --> 1239.6000000000001
naturally designed into the this

1235.919 --> 1243.3600000000001
place for our minds to stumble

1239.6 --> 1243.36
upon and have that

1247.919 --> 1254.919
consideration what do you think

1250.2 --> 1254.919
guys it's pretty good for a short show

1255.0 --> 1260.64
right anyway I think I'm going to turn

1257.36 --> 1262.799
on my taric coffee too I'm going to turn

1260.64 --> 1265.88
it on I'll be right back while you can

1262.799 --> 1265.8799999999999
think about what I just

1287.039 --> 1290.039
said

1314.64 --> 1319.98
and I'm

1317.039 --> 1324.2
back

1319.98 --> 1326.32
[Music]

1324.2 --> 1328.799
imagine Discovery is how to shorten

1326.32 --> 1332.9189999999999
distance from point A to point

1328.799 --> 1338.12
B verum inquir

1332.919 --> 1338.1200000000001
inquiry interesting name but

1339.96 --> 1345.88
yes I think

1342.039 --> 1349.36
that the way things are laid out and

1345.88 --> 1352.3600000000001
with the map we use it's already really

1349.36 --> 1353.76
weird like it already actually doesn't

1352.36 --> 1357.559
make

1353.76 --> 1360.52
sense I mean did you know that

1357.559 --> 1363.039
practically when you like deal with the

1360.52 --> 1365.6399999999999
land and everything that's on it

1363.039 --> 1366.799
everywhere if you just like move around

1365.64 --> 1368.4
on the

1366.799 --> 1371.549
map

1368.4 --> 1371.549
[Music]

1373.76 --> 1379.96
like it's flat it's all flat but

1380.76 --> 1386.1589999999999
it all just almost seems

1383.159 --> 1386.159
like

1388.76 --> 1395.8799999999999
maybe maybe like this the scale

1392.76 --> 1398.559
inconsistency is not because the layout

1395.88 --> 1401.72
is not really as is but

1398.559 --> 1405.2
because the realm itself might literally

1401.72 --> 1406.88
just have size

1405.2 --> 1409.1200000000001
differences I

1406.88 --> 1410.679
mean

1409.12 --> 1416.1589999999999
that's kind of

1410.679 --> 1419.279
weird but it's kind of like the idea of

1416.159 --> 1420.919
H what is it Doctor Who the Tardis that

1419.279 --> 1423.84
there's just more

1420.919 --> 1427.0
space in certain

1423.84 --> 1429.9599999999998
places what if there isn't just a wall

1427.0 --> 1433.6
to determine like where oh now within

1429.96 --> 1435.679
that wall it's more SP no what if it's

1433.6 --> 1439.12
just like no it's actually connect it's

1435.679 --> 1441.3200000000002
more like a a gradient

1439.12 --> 1443.32
a freaking

1441.32 --> 1444.9189999999999
gradient of

1443.32 --> 1447.9189999999999
Space

1444.919 --> 1447.919
volume

1449.84 --> 1456.6789999999999
Dynamics which is like extremely elusive

1453.84 --> 1458.1589999999999
when you think about it cuz it's like

1456.679 --> 1460.8400000000001
yeah you're just walking that yeah it's

1458.159 --> 1464.5200000000002
just there but really like if you if you

1460.84 --> 1469.1999999999998
want to like put it all together then it

1464.52 --> 1472.24
might just like yeah doesn't really fit

1469.2 --> 1476.24
somehow it it it should fit but it just

1472.24 --> 1479.0
doesn't fit how what like that and that

1476.24 --> 1482.44
that just keeps happening because well

1479.0 --> 1485.279
instead of everything being

1482.44 --> 1489.279
exactly the same volume Dynamics the

1485.279 --> 1491.6
same size in the same volume that's just

1489.279 --> 1493.72
like there might be a gradient some

1491.6 --> 1496.76
place it's just like no

1493.72 --> 1499.44
it's there literally is more in this

1496.76 --> 1501.76
volume but it's like really elusive

1499.44 --> 1503.24
because it like kind of gradates I I

1501.76 --> 1506.64
don't know maybe this is like super

1503.24 --> 1511.44
alien talk at this point for you guys I

1506.64 --> 1511.44
me yeah we talk about spatial Dynamics

1512.48 --> 1517.48
when yeah the best things I can even

1515.36 --> 1520.24
reference to is like oh the Tardis in

1517.48 --> 1521.919
Doctor Who or spatial looping the the

1520.24 --> 1523.6
tunnel in the train man station of the

1521.919 --> 1526.679
Matrix

1523.6 --> 1529.6789999999999
2 and then getting kind of wild with

1526.679 --> 1529.679
it

1533.48 --> 1537.96
right so the idea what I just tried to

1535.559 --> 1539.1589999999999
put down is like what if the Tardis

1537.96 --> 1542.44
effect

1539.159 --> 1547.8400000000001
isn't what if there was no wall to the

1542.44 --> 1550.6000000000001
Tardis but there is that volume there

1547.84 --> 1553.559
yeah I mean the walls a real convenient

1550.6 --> 1556.0
trick for the mind because the mind is

1553.559 --> 1558.36
very easy to think of like oh there's a

1556.0 --> 1560.36
little box I open the door there might

1558.36 --> 1561.52
be a room behind it it's like a

1560.36 --> 1566.0
magician's

1561.52 --> 1568.24
trick right but what if it's like no but

1566.0 --> 1573.12
you can literally see that square of

1568.24 --> 1576.2
space there but like as you look into

1573.12 --> 1579.32
it it's really big in there even though

1576.2 --> 1581.919
it only fits in

1579.32 --> 1584.76
there so it's like you're looking into

1581.919 --> 1587.3990000000001
something really small but then as you

1584.76 --> 1588.48
step into it it's really large and it's

1587.399 --> 1591.6
like

1588.48 --> 1594.559
no the outside world is actually really

1591.6 --> 1594.559
huge all of a

1595.399 --> 1602.9189999999999
sudden can you see

1598.08 --> 1604.84
it can you can you can you see that how

1602.919 --> 1607.76
that would

1604.84 --> 1611.4399999999998
work right and that's with a hard

1607.76 --> 1616.0
barrier like size change spatial Dynamic

1611.44 --> 1618.52
size change but if it was gradiated

1616.0 --> 1621.48
without a heart like oh miniature in

1618.52 --> 1625.12
here huge in comparison out there which

1621.48 --> 1627.64
is normal size but great you could never

1625.12 --> 1630.36
tell a a person that's literally this

1627.64 --> 1633.5590000000002
size could walk all the way over there

1630.36 --> 1635.52
and become that size and never notice

1633.559 --> 1637.799
the difference because everything else

1635.52 --> 1640.72
has changed exactly with it so to it

1637.799 --> 1645.44
it's always been the same and because of

1640.72 --> 1645.44
the gradiation you don't see the hard

1646.52 --> 1649.52
difference

1650.2 --> 1657.2
like the inside of a genie that's

1654.159 --> 1661.0
fascinating right this is the the

1657.2 --> 1661.0
complications of like spatial

1661.279 --> 1667.64
Dynamics you could say like oh this is

1664.2 --> 1670.519
Arn's pseudo ronian Force Space and I

1667.64 --> 1673.44
I'm afraid I could not really say like

1670.519 --> 1675.36
yeah well the difference though is is

1673.44 --> 1679.519
that

1675.36 --> 1682.32
this should be be

1679.519 --> 1686.559
falsifiable just like the

1682.32 --> 1686.559
loop should be

1686.88 --> 1692.64
falsifiable right and and that and

1689.48 --> 1694.88
that's very unlike einsteinian

1692.64 --> 1697.3200000000002
SpaceTime gravity mechanics where

1694.88 --> 1700.48
there's it's it's just there and you're

1697.32 --> 1702.799
supposed to like translate it but

1700.48 --> 1705.72
there's literally no actual connection

1702.799 --> 1708.32
while the looping aspects special

1705.72 --> 1711.679
nonlinearity there is liter test you can

1708.32 --> 1713.0
do to prove or disprove it there's this

1711.679 --> 1716.76
little

1713.0 --> 1721.039
hook that hooks in that that gives you

1716.76 --> 1721.039
this opportunity to make it

1721.6 --> 1728.1999999999998
empirical there I say to make it

1725.399 --> 1729.9189999999999
physical to make it provable this

1728.2 --> 1731.559
provable

1729.919 --> 1734.6000000000001
anyway

1731.559 --> 1735.96
portals have any place in this idea yeah

1734.6 --> 1739.399
well

1735.96 --> 1739.3990000000001
technically yes

1740.159 --> 1746.48
but the issue with portals is is it's

1742.64 --> 1750.3990000000001
again a hard barrier situation it's

1746.48 --> 1753.88
a portals and the idea of it just like a

1750.399 --> 1759.7199999999998
door to the Tardis that

1753.88 --> 1762.7600000000002
is like a hard barrier to

1759.72 --> 1765.64
refraction yeah it's like a hard Bearer

1762.76 --> 1768.2
to refraction oh poof angle

1765.64 --> 1770.88
change and it's very ible you see oh

1768.2 --> 1774.44
angle change right but now imagine that

1770.88 --> 1777.44
it's not a hard barrier but actually

1774.44 --> 1780.519
subtle how do you you see something

1777.44 --> 1783.3200000000002
changing a bit it's much harder to tell

1780.519 --> 1783.32
what's actually

1785.08 --> 1790.559
happening so if there's some kind of

1787.919 --> 1794.64
portal effects I don't think they're

1790.559 --> 1797.519
just hard bordered edged

1794.64 --> 1799.3200000000002
portals it as part of the realm it would

1797.519 --> 1802.32
be more like a a

1799.32 --> 1802.32
gradiated

1803.0 --> 1808.24
effect not hard

1805.24 --> 1808.24
barriered

1809.79 --> 1814.96
[Music]

1816.96 --> 1821.3600000000001
anyway navigation software is all over

1819.76 --> 1823.519
the place when it comes to exact

1821.36 --> 1826.12
distances oh

1823.519 --> 1829.24
really what kind of navigation software

1826.12 --> 1829.2399999999998
do you use very

1844.6 --> 1848.4399999999998
inquiry the jump

1853.679 --> 1859.24
location that's hilarious well Tommy

1856.24 --> 1859.24
look

1860.159 --> 1868.0390000000002
yeah a jump location a portal

1864.559 --> 1872.08
dude yeah sure I

1868.039 --> 1874.76
mean I think that like jump Gates or

1872.08 --> 1876.639
portals if you will is like actually

1874.76 --> 1880.48
much more attainable

1876.639 --> 1880.4799999999998
logically than things like

1881.559 --> 1888.48
teleportation I mean especially if it's

1885.039 --> 1891.799
literally inherent to the

1888.48 --> 1894.6390000000001
realm put there by the designer as in

1891.799 --> 1897.84
like there is Portal capabilities in the

1894.639 --> 1901.32
realm that's why the designer initiated

1897.84 --> 1903.399
them as part of the design well if it's

1901.32 --> 1906.4399999999998
there as part of the design well then it

1903.399 --> 1910.279
we it's only logical to conclude that we

1906.44 --> 1913.279
too might be

1910.279 --> 1916.159
capable of figuring out how that works

1913.279 --> 1918.399
and use it

1916.159 --> 1921.44
technologically

1918.399 --> 1921.4399999999998
and might already

1921.48 --> 1926.76
have right why everybody's still

1923.519 --> 1929.32
wondering about stupid Globe nonsense

1926.76 --> 1933.08
they probably figure that

1929.32 --> 1933.08
out probably in the

1935.279 --> 1940.08
60s but I don't know it might have like

1937.799 --> 1943.84
all kinds of dramatic side effects so

1940.08 --> 1947.799
that they just that it's

1943.84 --> 1950.0
not like with computers micronize like

1947.799 --> 1953.6
you could just like oh a

1950.0 --> 1955.88
micro portal or whatever without no it

1953.6 --> 1959.1999999999998
probably whenever that's done it has

1955.88 --> 1961.519
like massive energetic disruptions and

1959.2 --> 1963.559
might create giant lightning storms or

1961.519 --> 1966.36
something right that that could be

1963.559 --> 1968.36
really Savage it might have some or

1966.36 --> 1971.32
heavy Earth it might have all kinds of

1968.36 --> 1974.519
heavy side effects which is like why

1971.32 --> 1979.039
they don't just readily use it like

1974.519 --> 1979.039
teleportation in Star Trek

1979.2 --> 1984.2
right I mean if you're going to

1981.36 --> 1987.559
literally use the mechanisms of the

1984.2 --> 1989.6000000000001
realm to technological technologically

1987.559 --> 1992.24
bypass them well that's going to have

1989.6 --> 1994.84
some influence on the stability of the

1992.24 --> 1999.519
realm because it's literally

1994.84 --> 2002.1999999999998
inside of such a system so you're like

1999.519 --> 2004.08
messing with the Matrix you could say as

2002.2 --> 2006.24
a comparison you're just messing with

2004.08 --> 2007.799
the fabric of it in order to achieve

2006.24 --> 2009.159
something techn logically well they

2007.799 --> 2012.96
could have

2009.159 --> 2014.5500000000002
instabilities on the very nature of how

2012.96 --> 2017.88
things work

2014.55 --> 2017.8799999999999
[Music]

2018.399 --> 2024.559
so okay I'm still here OBS was acting

2022.2 --> 2024.559
weird

2032.559 --> 2039.9189999999999
again right so yeah hey short show

2038.159 --> 2042.5590000000002
but it's a good show right I'm going to

2039.919 --> 2044.8400000000001
get my coffee and then I'm just going to

2042.559 --> 2048.24
leave this idea for here find figure out

2044.84 --> 2050.7999999999997
a title and see if you guys can actually

2048.24 --> 2052.4799999999996
follow what I'm talking about and not

2050.8 --> 2055.679
just talking about other things like

2052.48 --> 2055.679
usual be right

2065.879 --> 2068.879
back

2109.599 --> 2111.96
I'm

2117.72 --> 2122.48
back oh are you guys happy that I came

2120.839 --> 2124.2
on to do the show even though it was

2122.48 --> 2128.52
short or

2124.2 --> 2132.7999999999997
not great ideas all right how do I put

2128.52 --> 2132.8
this translate this into a

2155.8 --> 2158.8
title

2167.75 --> 2171.099

2174.11 --> 2177.9390000000003
[Music]

2184.2 --> 2188.72

2185.72 --> 2188.72
e

2189.74 --> 2197.06
[Music]

2202.64 --> 2208.4
yeah that's

2205.35 --> 2208.4
[Music]

2214.2 --> 2219.68
it o I like that this this is almost

2217.2 --> 2222.64
science fiction

2219.68 --> 2223.96
material I was thinking first bypassing

2222.64 --> 2228.319
the

2223.96 --> 2231.0
loop then I was thinking forcing the

2228.319 --> 2233.56
loop yeah forcing the loop to create

2231.0 --> 2236.96
jump gate

2233.56 --> 2240.68
technology and of course spatial size

2236.96 --> 2240.68
gradients had to be in

2240.9 --> 2243.9390000000003
[Music]

2245.599 --> 2248.599
there

2253.72 --> 2262.2
baboom I reply sorry DED I've been

2257.04 --> 2266.64
really busy putting down my idea

2262.2 --> 2266.64
I I got time to read up

2271.76 --> 2278.599
now need physical barrier oh about the

2274.52 --> 2278.599
refraction there some energy or

2282.44 --> 2288.599
uh okay that sounds really interesting

2285.92 --> 2290.48
magical I mean we did get the video

2288.599 --> 2293.2000000000003
about the orbs that went around the

2290.48 --> 2296.68
airplane and then teleported or

2293.2 --> 2298.8799999999997
something right but I mean first off

2296.68 --> 2301.8799999999997
that literally might be

2298.88 --> 2304.079
CGI despite

2301.88 --> 2307.7200000000003
everything

2304.079 --> 2311.28
and yeah that might be it it might be a

2307.72 --> 2315.319
thing that they do it might literally be

2311.28 --> 2317.6800000000003
by like forcing the loop it it might be

2315.319 --> 2320.2799999999997
jump gate technology that you saw right

2317.68 --> 2323.0789999999997
there they might not even need like a

2320.28 --> 2326.0400000000004
a a gate thing they might they could

2323.079 --> 2330.1600000000003
just have like flying drones that can

2326.04 --> 2330.16
literally just do that on the

2333.56 --> 2338.68
spot it kind of reminds me of like

2336.56 --> 2342.0789999999997
Starcraft protos

2338.68 --> 2345.3999999999996
technology those spheres didn't it do

2342.079 --> 2345.4
that with you

2345.83 --> 2351.68
[Music]

2347.599 --> 2351.6800000000003
guys anyway cheers I'm going

2353.47 --> 2356.79
[Music]

2357.04 --> 2362.65
to did anybody notice that video you

2360.52 --> 2365.44
must have It's Been

[Music]

2365.44 --> 2371.599
Everywhere

2368.319 --> 2375.68
want to try to play my yeah sure duper

2371.599 --> 2379.15
not right now like the title

2375.68 --> 2382.8689999999997
good as star

2379.15 --> 2382.869
[Music]

2385.09 --> 2388.239
[Music]

2395.4 --> 2400.96
water but I'm very proud of just like

2398.72 --> 2403.16
explaining spatial size gradients this

2400.96 --> 2406.7200000000003
is not the first time by the way I

2403.16 --> 2409.92
brought that idea to the table because

2406.72 --> 2411.839
in my earlier modeling attempts of like

2409.92 --> 2414.04
the

2411.839 --> 2417.0
orientation this is the complication

2414.04 --> 2420.2
like I keep oversimplifying my own work

2417.0 --> 2424.2
just to keep it ex like clear to follow

2420.2 --> 2428.24
in the mind because like even if

2424.2 --> 2431.0
guys even if the equator is a circle

2428.24 --> 2434.56
that doesn't mean it's not spatially

2431.0 --> 2436.079
looping it actually means it even more

2434.56 --> 2440.2
because

2436.079 --> 2443.0
now that map has scale

2440.2 --> 2446.8799999999997
inconsistencies even though it's

2443.0 --> 2449.8
lital yeah there so like they don't say

2446.88 --> 2451.88
that over at Mark sard or David white or

2449.8 --> 2455.88
whatever oh look this is the thing look

2451.88 --> 2459.04
at this no yeah but there might lit it

2455.88 --> 2461.319
might guys this is so freaking

2459.04 --> 2464.079
weird I bet somebody's going to clip

2461.319 --> 2467.24
this I don't give a [ __ ]

2464.079 --> 2471.6800000000003
uh it might literally be a

2467.24 --> 2473.04
disc in which the inside of the disc

2471.68 --> 2477.24
everything is

2473.04 --> 2479.359
like twice as small as everything on the

2477.24 --> 2483.9599999999996
most outside of the disc and everything

2479.359 --> 2487.119
is twice as big like the actual realm

2483.96 --> 2490.96
might be a dis specific specifically if

2487.119 --> 2490.96
the equator is measured a

2491.72 --> 2496.7599999999998
circle and then we would have to take

2494.079 --> 2500.2400000000002
all the map reading of the circle centic

2496.76 --> 2504.1600000000003
dis map idea literal well then there is

2500.24 --> 2508.04
probably a spatial size gradient yeah it

2504.16 --> 2509.56
might literally be there and the thing

2508.04 --> 2513.319
is

2509.56 --> 2515.319
only a pure outside force that is

2513.319 --> 2518.079
unconnected to the world spatially in

2515.319 --> 2520.96
any way could look look at it and see

2518.079 --> 2524.6800000000003
the size difference of

2520.96 --> 2528.319
it because if you are in the world you

2524.68 --> 2531.2
are subjected to the spatial size

2528.319 --> 2534.2799999999997
gradient to the warping of space itself

2531.2 --> 2536.96
of the volume you move within and then

2534.28 --> 2538.6400000000003
to you it wouldn't be like that

2536.96 --> 2540.48
everything would be the same size and

2538.64 --> 2544.16
there would just be more space that

2540.48 --> 2546.319
didn't fit within that space that is

2544.16 --> 2548.7999999999997
what would it would be like to the

2546.319 --> 2551.04
person that is physically within that

2548.8 --> 2553.52
spatial

2551.04 --> 2556.64
gradient but to an

2553.52 --> 2559.4
outsider when projecting a map or

2556.64 --> 2561.0789999999997
whatever yeah yeah everything on the

2559.4 --> 2564.319
inside's twice as small as everything on

2561.079 --> 2566.96
the outside yeah what you going to do

2564.319 --> 2568.839
yeah it doesn't make sense but it is

2566.96 --> 2570.559
that and when you walk in there it's

2568.839 --> 2573.44
like yeah there's just more volume in

2570.559 --> 2575.2400000000002
the middle there yeah it's flat it fits

2573.44 --> 2577.92
more volume in there oh we go to the

2575.24 --> 2582.0789999999997
outside oh the out side ring is just as

2577.92 --> 2583.88
big or smaller even as the equator ring

2582.079 --> 2586.2400000000002
yeah that doesn't make any sense yeah

2583.88 --> 2589.839
but it's all flat and it all fits yeah

2586.24 --> 2592.839
so you [ __ ] think of an alternative

2589.839 --> 2592.839
then

2592.96 --> 2599.7200000000003
okay this is what I'm saying

2597.359 --> 2603.5589999999997
guys yeah this is starting to sound

2599.72 --> 2609.2
almost like 2015 what the [ __ ] isn't

2603.559 --> 2611.7200000000003
it well it was always that it's just so

2609.2 --> 2613.9199999999996
hard to catch on when people just trap

2611.72 --> 2616.72
you

2613.92 --> 2618.28
into scantly

2616.72 --> 2621.7999999999997
informed

2618.28 --> 2624.48
dichotomies with models with just very

2621.8 --> 2626.6800000000003
sparing information really and even

2624.48 --> 2628.28
deeper consideration and like the

2626.68 --> 2631.3999999999996
open-ended question of what we don't

2628.28 --> 2634.079
know is all so trimmed down skeletal

2631.4 --> 2636.7200000000003
version of it and then you're just like

2634.079 --> 2640.119
yeah you don't get those ideas like that

2636.72 --> 2642.52
are probably literally there like as in

2640.119 --> 2645.599
we're living that we're just not even

2642.52 --> 2648.44
close to realizing it because we're all

2645.599 --> 2649.96
stuck in stupid false dichotomies in a

2648.44 --> 2653.04
feast of

2649.96 --> 2656.64
nonsense and the official

2653.04 --> 2658.2
claims between those

2656.64 --> 2662.16
two

2658.2 --> 2664.0789999999997
right but hey thank God there's an Arn

2662.16 --> 2666.52
here

2664.079 --> 2670.6800000000003
that is able to l

2666.52 --> 2670.68
bypass all that crap

2673.43 --> 2676.5099999999998
[Music]

2678.4 --> 2685.8
mentally I make you all blow your mind

2682.48 --> 2687.72
with wonder about what the [ __ ] that

2685.8 --> 2691.1600000000003
could actually be real that's super

2687.72 --> 2694.9599999999996
surreal freaky [ __ ] that normally you'd

2691.16 --> 2697.7599999999998
reserve for some surreal movie or

2694.96 --> 2700.16
whatever like wo

2697.76 --> 2702.119
freaky like the world where they have

2700.16 --> 2703.839
like oh there's another world and you

2702.119 --> 2707.079
can just literally

2703.839 --> 2709.04
like upside down world right next like

2707.079 --> 2711.76
surreal [ __ ] right and you're like w

2709.04 --> 2713.72
that's freaky and then Arn's explaining

2711.76 --> 2717.0400000000004
like yeah there might be a spatial size

2713.72 --> 2719.9199999999996
gradian and it's like yeah that might

2717.04 --> 2723.2799999999997
literally be the case like it it sounds

2719.92 --> 2726.8
crazy right but it could literally be

2723.28 --> 2729.7200000000003
happening we might be in it and that is

2726.8 --> 2732.48
happening literally as described as

2729.72 --> 2732.48
crazy as it

2733.599 --> 2737.48
sounds are you going to disprove it or

2736.359 --> 2740.839
you just

2737.48 --> 2744.96
going that's ridiculous I

2740.839 --> 2747.44
mean Newton would never agree to that

2744.96 --> 2750.0
and all the other people from 200 years

2747.44 --> 2752.2400000000002
ago and even Einstein would maybe

2750.0 --> 2753.96
Einstein would though because Einstein

2752.24 --> 2758.3999999999996
was a freaky

2753.96 --> 2762.44
guy who married his cousin twice

2758.4 --> 2765.1600000000003
but yeah it's crazy what if it's

2762.44 --> 2768.48
real how are you going to prove it isn't

2765.16 --> 2772.7999999999997
real I know how to figure out whether it

2768.48 --> 2775.359
is real it's just you have to then still

2772.8 --> 2778.96
if you're going to see it be able to

2775.359 --> 2779.96
accept that as I would be testing it

2778.96 --> 2783.92
that the

2779.96 --> 2783.92
results might prove me

2784.8 --> 2790.0
right

2787.28 --> 2791.8390000000004
right but but first off before we do

2790.0 --> 2794.839
anything about testing the spatial

2791.839 --> 2797.319
looping nature it's just like yeah

2794.839 --> 2798.64
equator measure the equator you have to

2797.319 --> 2800.16
measure it you have to measure

2798.64 --> 2801.359
everything but you have to definitely

2800.16 --> 2804.16
start with the

2801.359 --> 2806.48
equator what is it is it a straight line

2804.16 --> 2811.24
is it an arc is it a full

2806.48 --> 2814.119
circle and then proceed from that point

2811.24 --> 2816.2799999999997
on and I mean just the implications of

2814.119 --> 2818.119
the results of that measurement is going

2816.28 --> 2820.52
to

2818.119 --> 2824.1600000000003
be

2820.52 --> 2825.4
heavy because now you got empirical data

2824.16 --> 2829.359
that's

2825.4 --> 2832.359
like basically going to severely

2829.359 --> 2836.44
limit the Dynamics of what could be

2832.359 --> 2839.359
possible but thereby also narrowing down

2836.44 --> 2841.44
that road and bringing those surreal

2839.359 --> 2844.64
options because in every freaking

2841.44 --> 2846.4
Direction guys it's surreal wherever you

2844.64 --> 2849.92
take the possibility it's going to be

2846.4 --> 2852.04
surreal because reality is surreal so no

2849.92 --> 2853.88
matter what it turns out to be it's

2852.04 --> 2856.88
going to be surreal

2853.88 --> 2856.88
guys

2857.24 --> 2862.04
right and so it's like oh just because

2860.24 --> 2862.839
the equator turns out to be a circle

2862.04 --> 2865.88
could

2862.839 --> 2868.4
be doesn't mean that it ends there man

2865.88 --> 2871.079
because yeah what about those scaling

2868.4 --> 2876.359
consist like oh David Wise marks are

2871.079 --> 2879.28
deal yes my app won my app won it is a

2876.359 --> 2883.48
disc woohoo I'm the winner I actually

2879.28 --> 2885.52
deserve my yacht now because I was right

2883.48 --> 2889.16
yeah but what about our skill

2885.52 --> 2892.48
inconsistencies though now right because

2889.16 --> 2895.3999999999996
now that's literal how are you going to

2892.48 --> 2898.96
explain all that stuff fitting at the

2895.4 --> 2901.319
North Pole when it shouldn't fit there

2898.96 --> 2904.76
cuz that shouldn't

2901.319 --> 2908.7599999999998
fit and H how come like all that edge of

2904.76 --> 2908.76
the Antarctica is

2909.68 --> 2918.5989999999997
also so small like that that shouldn't

2913.76 --> 2920.6800000000003
fit around everything makes no sense

2918.599 --> 2924.839
it's all flat how can it fit yeah yeah

2920.68 --> 2928.64
yeah oh see it doesn't end it never ends

2924.839 --> 2932.319
The Surreal nature never ends yeah CU if

2928.64 --> 2934.64
if it's actually a dis well then spatial

2932.319 --> 2937.7599999999998
size grad is going to be a very serious

2934.64 --> 2940.24
issue to figure out out because now we

2937.76 --> 2941.76
have this scaling consistency and there

2940.24 --> 2943.359
might be people that are going to think

2941.76 --> 2946.44
of the earth

2943.359 --> 2951.24
instead like a

2946.44 --> 2955.079
tube a flat tube or a looping

2951.24 --> 2960.2799999999997
realm at that point right I mean as soon

2955.079 --> 2962.7200000000003
as it it comes out like hey spatial size

2960.28 --> 2964.96
gradient people are going to ah yeah

2962.72 --> 2967.68
okay it's looping it's looping no size

2964.96 --> 2969.799
gradient shut up shut up Arwin it's just

2967.68 --> 2973.04
looping okay it's just looping there's

2969.799 --> 2975.44
no size gradients ah okay it's just

2973.04 --> 2976.68
looping it's just loop size gradients

2975.44 --> 2980.52
don't

2976.68 --> 2982.359
exist yes but it's looping that's cool

2980.52 --> 2984.7599999999998
yeah we get it there's movies they warn

2982.359 --> 2988.48
us oh we always knew it was looping what

2984.76 --> 2990.5200000000004
are you whining about yeah we knew 500

2988.48 --> 2991.76
years ago was looping because of blah

2990.52 --> 2994.92
blah blah

2991.76 --> 2998.1600000000003
blah but don't you dare talk about size

2994.92 --> 3000.76
gradients is too far man stop it you're

2998.16 --> 3000.7599999999998
giving me a

3001.119 --> 3004.52
headache R

3007.16 --> 3012.0789999999997
win

3009.72 --> 3015.0
right it's been a blast but I think I'm

3012.079 --> 3015.0
going to end the show

3015.28 --> 3020.28
now hope youve all been enjoying the

3017.72 --> 3020.2799999999997
very short

3021.72 --> 3029.4399999999996
show intense but short

3024.44 --> 3029.44
right no Illuminati I'm sorry

3030.599 --> 3035.28
x320 I just too busy talking to

3044.0 --> 3051.04
eat old stuff that Kenny was talking

3046.72 --> 3051.04
about Martin yeah I remember Martin

3051.96 --> 3057.44
Kenny Dragon Ball

3054.44 --> 3057.44
what

3073.319 --> 3079.0
what the

3075.079 --> 3079.0
pink right you

3079.24 --> 3086.359
have yeah verum inquiry you why the hell

3084.079 --> 3089.1600000000003
is that two re in

3086.359 --> 3091.839
but I mean you seem to be pretty cool

3089.16 --> 3095.16
but I mean yeah the it would be cool if

3091.839 --> 3098.119
you had a more custom made profile pick

3095.16 --> 3101.2
than that pink

3098.119 --> 3103.88
purple background with the v in

3101.2 --> 3106.16
it I think that's probably where terod

3103.88 --> 3107.6800000000003
objects a bit and I get that I it it

3106.16 --> 3108.799
didn't really care because what you're

3107.68 --> 3112.359
saying is

3108.799 --> 3114.359
cool but maybe like personalize your

3112.359 --> 3117.359
account a little bit more that would

3114.359 --> 3117.359
help

3118.24 --> 3123.839
yeah yeah don't worry

3120.96 --> 3126.92
tret yeah tet's sort of my security

3123.839 --> 3129.04
officer in a way and he takes that job

3126.92 --> 3133.7200000000003
very serious even though he's officially

3129.04 --> 3133.72
doesn't have it but I mean I'm cool with

3133.96 --> 3139.44
it it's only the lonely guy oh [ __ ]

3141.48 --> 3147.28
whatever is it is it though how do you

3144.76 --> 3147.28
know

3163.079 --> 3167.119
well don't you remember too what yeah of

3164.68 --> 3167.1189999999997
course I

3167.68 --> 3173.799
remember but

3170.52 --> 3176.28
who I mean ver inquir I don't know who

3173.799 --> 3178.359
he is he says he's going to like like

3176.28 --> 3180.3590000000004
get in that I don't think he's a sock I

3178.359 --> 3183.839
don't think he's one of them Tommy I

3180.359 --> 3187.4
don't know either but I mean yeah he

3183.839 --> 3189.4
could be but to be fair dude a newcomer

3187.4 --> 3192.64
might get a bit

3189.4 --> 3195.2400000000002
irritated when they're constantly being

3192.64 --> 3197.799
pointed at as well I

3195.24 --> 3201.319
mean now of course all the other

3197.799 --> 3203.839
infiltrants didn't do anything

3201.319 --> 3206.119
suspicious and neither is Tommy so that

3203.839 --> 3208.92
could mean that he will be an infiltrate

3206.119 --> 3212.44
I don't really care again

3208.92 --> 3215.119
teret right what are they going to

3212.44 --> 3217.839
achieve these people with their soccer

3215.119 --> 3221.6400000000003
accounts can already just watch the show

3217.839 --> 3223.68
so if they don't do anything suspicious

3221.64 --> 3225.72
except for being new and being

3223.68 --> 3227.64
potentially an infiltrator does it

3225.72 --> 3230.68
really matter right they're not going to

3227.64 --> 3233.7599999999998
get a wrench the original problem with

3230.68 --> 3236.24
the infiltrators was the wrenches it was

3233.76 --> 3237.96
the problem

3236.24 --> 3241.68
because somebody was [ __ ] around with

3237.96 --> 3243.799
my band list that problem is finished

3241.68 --> 3245.48
it's completely done there's no more

3243.799 --> 3247.88
infiltrators with wrenches and that

3245.48 --> 3250.48
means I'm never going to give anybody a

3247.88 --> 3253.4
wrench unless I fully vetted them that

3250.48 --> 3256.2
means I want to see you and hear you

3253.4 --> 3259.6800000000003
moving on

3256.2 --> 3262.96
camera and then and yeah you're one of

3259.68 --> 3262.96
the few exceptions though

3263.96 --> 3269.799
teret but but pretty much I just really

3267.72 --> 3272.3999999999996
want to know you as a person before I

3269.799 --> 3275.92
give you a wrench I want to know it's

3272.4 --> 3278.839
like I want your full passport

3275.92 --> 3282.359
photograph ID I want full ID before I

3278.839 --> 3285.7599999999998
give you a rent yeah sort of not

3282.359 --> 3289.2799999999997
literally but yeah I'm just really glad

3285.76 --> 3290.2400000000002
that that freaking wrench infiltrator is

3289.28 --> 3292.92
all

3290.24 --> 3296.2799999999997
gone and it doesn't really matter

3292.92 --> 3299.319
anymore now if they just want infiltrate

3296.28 --> 3299.3190000000004
because they're not going to get a

3300.44 --> 3306.76
wrench

3303.4 --> 3309.839
see still going four more hours thank

3306.76 --> 3312.7990000000004
you Rick backck but I actually it's more

3309.839 --> 3312.799
like four more

3314.68 --> 3319.64
minutes I started really late but it's

3317.599 --> 3322.319
been a fantastic show though so very if

3319.64 --> 3324.1189999999997
you haven't actually been there and seen

3322.319 --> 3326.319
the entire show I definitely recommend

3324.119 --> 3327.359
you go back because this was like very

3326.319 --> 3331.52
in

3327.359 --> 3331.52
intense you just read the

3331.88 --> 3337.88
title and then you get the idea of like

3334.76 --> 3337.88
what kind of a show this

3350.96 --> 3359.119
was ter you're so defensive I do like

3354.72 --> 3363.5589999999997
that though in a way I do like that it's

3359.119 --> 3365.599
like yeah man I want my Indian security

3363.559 --> 3367.92
at least they take it serious like they

3365.599 --> 3370.119
beat people with sticks if necessary

3367.92 --> 3372.599
they don't just like oh we're rolling

3370.119 --> 3375.2000000000003
here with the rainbow flag oh we're

3372.599 --> 3378.28
we're so harmless no no this is freaking

3375.2 --> 3379.4399999999996
Indian security they they use sticks I

3378.28 --> 3385.88
like

3379.44 --> 3389.2000000000003
that right I like that but in this case

3385.88 --> 3393.6400000000003
just take it easy Ted it's okay Stand

3389.2 --> 3393.64
Down Soldier it's okay for

3398.88 --> 3403.559
now activities to find trly tendency

3401.72 --> 3406.72
yeah it is great and I mean you're

3403.559 --> 3411.2000000000003
you're sharp dude you're doing

3406.72 --> 3411.2
great a little tense but you're doing

3412.4 --> 3419.28
great who would win between any and

3415.359 --> 3423.319
Moroccan security I don't

3419.28 --> 3426.92
know Moroccans are pretty badass some of

3423.319 --> 3430.599
them especially when they like are get

3426.92 --> 3432.52
older than like 30 then they really

3430.599 --> 3434.96
become awesome before that they're kind

3432.52 --> 3437.359
of [ __ ] annoying at

3434.96 --> 3440.359
times to

3437.359 --> 3443.799
me have ego issues a lot of them but

3440.359 --> 3445.44
like the older ones are like

3443.799 --> 3447.2
Epic

3445.44 --> 3450.44
they're so

3447.2 --> 3452.16
sharp and they're so good at reading

3450.44 --> 3455.28
people it's

3452.16 --> 3458.1189999999997
amazing so yeah I really appreciate

3455.28 --> 3460.44
Moroccans but the older ones the younger

3458.119 --> 3462.88
ones can be quite

3460.44 --> 3465.359
annoying not saying they all are I mean

3462.88 --> 3467.839
it all deter depends on like how much

3465.359 --> 3470.96
they hang around in groups and [ __ ] or

3467.839 --> 3473.88
if the ones that are like really

3470.96 --> 3475.599
self-reliant and independent minded and

3473.88 --> 3478.1600000000003
don't typically like the hanging groups

3475.599 --> 3478.1600000000003
those are

3479.039 --> 3486.48
epic

3480.68 --> 3488.2
Moroccans oh micans oh I read it wrong

3486.48 --> 3490.44
okay

3488.2 --> 3492.2799999999997
sorry that's funny because there are

3490.44 --> 3494.119
Moroccans here that's like a thing in

3492.28 --> 3496.6400000000003
the Netherlands so I thought

3494.119 --> 3498.799
Moroccans like Indian or Moroccan

3496.64 --> 3501.24
security that's like a legitimate

3498.799 --> 3503.88
question because there are like

3501.24 --> 3506.72
Moroccans in security business here in

3503.88 --> 3506.7200000000003
the Netherland so

3507.4 --> 3513.1600000000003
that's why I thought that I don't know

3510.16 --> 3513.16
man

3513.48 --> 3517.0
Americans or

3518.559 --> 3526.4
Indian it all depends on on the on the

3523.039 --> 3528.44
quality class I guess and the same would

3526.4 --> 3530.799
go with India too I mean I bet that

3528.44 --> 3533.2000000000003
India has like cheap ass

3530.799 --> 3536.48
security where it's just some dude that

3533.2 --> 3538.2799999999997
just like oh I I'm I'll not fall asleep

3536.48 --> 3540.64
he'll do be do a shitty job but he'll

3538.28 --> 3544.0
not fall asleep right and then there's

3540.64 --> 3544.0
like the high the

3545.24 --> 3551.64
high like high upgrade security where

3549.64 --> 3554.72
they're like ex military and they like

3551.64 --> 3556.839
really know their game and and they will

3554.72 --> 3559.0789999999997
be more expensive and with the US will

3556.839 --> 3563.119
be the same I mean you'll get the shitty

3559.079 --> 3567.119
fat X cop kind of like security guy or

3563.119 --> 3571.92
whatever and you get like basically the

3567.119 --> 3575.28
the Rambo guy that's like yeah this is

3571.92 --> 3578.2200000000003
secure right right going to be a giant

3575.28 --> 3591.0
difference in Pay class

3578.22 --> 3591.0
[Music]

3593.64 --> 3596.64
but

3605.2 --> 3610.16
the ones with the guns at

3607.52 --> 3613.48
least right anyway yeah hope you're all

3610.16 --> 3617.24
enjoying the show I'm going to round out

3613.48 --> 3620.48
I've been running 50 minutes

3617.24 --> 3622.839
overtime rounding after roughly an

3620.48 --> 3624.72
hour I hope you all enjoyed it I thought

3622.839 --> 3626.96
it was a great I'm kind of sorry to let

3624.72 --> 3626.9599999999996
It

3627.24 --> 3632.3999999999996
Go but I mean the subject has been fully

3630.52 --> 3634.799
discussed and now this is getting kind

3632.4 --> 3638.28
of weird with about security and

3634.799 --> 3640.28
stuff so I'm just going to run out

3638.28 --> 3642.3590000000004
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

3640.28 --> 3644.1600000000003
