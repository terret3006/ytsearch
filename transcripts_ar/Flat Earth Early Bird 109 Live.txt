[Music]

47.43 --> 56.449
Arwen and today is a very beautiful day

52.97 --> 56.449
it's very beautiful

58.04 --> 66.57
just as sunny as yesterday but for some

60.809 --> 71.3
reason do we see planes flying but they

66.57 --> 76.979
are not leaving any chemtrails this time

71.3 --> 80.0
why but yeah for whatever it's worth I

76.979 --> 80.0
thank them

85.84 --> 90.509
totally clear totally

93.13 --> 96.21
it is amazing

96.56 --> 101.77
and yeah I appreciate it a great deal

107.159 --> 118.159
so how are you guys all doing see a

112.409 --> 126.539
clouded chat Steve Voynich Nathan Oakley

118.159 --> 130.769
neon noodle ute Colin Turner / moko yeah

126.539 --> 136.68
I could see you all check my volume I

130.769 --> 137.22
think I forgot that yep this should be a

136.68 --> 145.19
little better

137.22 --> 145.19
oh my god so much happening

151.17 --> 156.89
like all these stories are just

153.569 --> 156.89
continuing and just

158.68 --> 167.11
becoming more extensive more complex

163.95 --> 169.79899999999998
just watching in awe as everything

167.11 --> 169.799
unfolds

174.69 --> 182.7
been watching quite a lot of videos

176.73 --> 186.0
today before the show started reading a

182.7 --> 188.28
lot of news articles again follow up

186.0 --> 191.76
another follow-up thing about the whole

188.28 --> 196.14000000000001
fatness away last situation it's just

191.76 --> 200.84
like what there's more I kind of felt it

196.14 --> 204.45
coming but yeah there's some really

200.84 --> 211.2
really elaborate articles about that on

204.45 --> 214.89
RT today just shows like how complex

211.2 --> 218.57
this whole scenario really is see if I

214.89 --> 218.57
can present that for a moment

234.55 --> 241.54000000000002
right I talked about yesterday about

237.57 --> 242.2
yeah who who lit the trucks on fire who

241.54 --> 244.95999999999998
did that

242.2 --> 247.72
well it seems to have moved on from hats

244.96 --> 250.92000000000002
a lot and it's weird

247.72 --> 250.92
we're discovery

254.19 --> 260.93
I'm still wondering like what why what's

258.81 --> 263.22
the meaning of this

260.93 --> 267.6
I'll just read out the title eight

263.22 --> 271.17
trucks carry nails and wire for

267.6 --> 276.74
barricades the Venezuelan foreign

271.17 --> 282.84000000000003
minister says showing photos and proof

276.74 --> 286.65000000000003
yeah that that's that makes it more

282.84 --> 295.82
complex now doesn't it it's a very

286.65 --> 299.48999999999995
elaborate article and yeah things like

295.82 --> 302.4
deep State players Marco Rubio Marco

299.49 --> 305.64
Rubio threatening sending the

302.4 --> 309.03
threatening tweet about comparing Maduro

305.64 --> 315.18
with Gadhafi it's just nasty

309.03 --> 320.25
and yeah the concept of Trojan Trojan

315.18 --> 327.96
horse eight trucks yeah there's this

320.25 --> 330.36
video report it's so big it is it's good

327.96 --> 335.53999999999996
that there are some people on this and

330.36 --> 338.34000000000003
writing concerning this because just

335.54 --> 339.93
little o me could never cover all of

338.34 --> 342.63
this and all the angles all the

339.93 --> 348.41
political angles and the historical

342.63 --> 351.18
angles of how the u.s. goes to work and

348.41 --> 354.72
also mentioning yeah they have been

351.18 --> 357.78000000000003
sanctioning Venezuela so it all just

354.72 --> 360.81
coming together and just showing this

357.78 --> 367.03999999999996
complex part of the geopolitical

360.81 --> 367.04
movement what's happening there and

368.21 --> 373.58
it's just heavy stuff and I really

371.78 --> 375.48999999999995
wonder what's gonna come out of it I

373.58 --> 379.90999999999997
really do

375.49 --> 382.94
so yeah that's that one and then there's

379.91 --> 385.49
another situation I kind of didn't get

382.94 --> 389.259
too much into it but that that's another

385.49 --> 393.83
typical thing let's switch right to it

389.259 --> 397.40000000000003
Pakistan India showdown and of course

393.83 --> 400.88
what we're not being told which is bound

397.4 --> 403.48999999999995
to be a lot but yeah that happened like

400.88 --> 405.979
an escalation between them now India and

403.49 --> 409.19
Pakistan are traditional enemies they

405.979 --> 411.56
have been for a long time fighting over

409.19 --> 415.099
the province of Kashmir that is right in

411.56 --> 419.32
between them and then you get into the

415.099 --> 424.06
long history of what happened there how

419.32 --> 424.06
it's also yeah

424.67 --> 432.46000000000004
and

427.389 --> 435.729
you call it like maybe I should call it

432.46 --> 438.849
Imperial Islam because yeah as I talked

435.729 --> 440.729
about earlier there is definitely good

438.849 --> 445.9
things about the religion of Islam

440.729 --> 450.55
there's also the hardcore Islamic state

445.9 --> 453.789
concept that is also has been floating

450.55 --> 458.11
for a while and is doing things and yet

453.789 --> 461.289
there was terrorist attack in Kashmir by

458.11 --> 463.539
Pakistan and then India started to send

461.289 --> 466.93
out planes and bombing Pakistani

463.539 --> 473.11
territory pretty pretty tense scenario

466.93 --> 476.349
and I guess it was bound to happen but

473.11 --> 479.349
yeah it does bring up the tension some

476.349 --> 481.529
more in that region and then there's the

479.349 --> 485.46
background of all that because yeah

481.529 --> 490.12
people know in the Middle East period

485.46 --> 493.29999999999995
Pakistan was also getting meddled with

490.12 --> 496.69
you could say or taking involvement of

493.3 --> 499.599
the US and the neocons what they did

496.69 --> 501.879
there and showing a little bit of

499.599 --> 507.539
background of yeah how the US has been

501.879 --> 516.149
using radical Islam basically for covert

507.539 --> 520.269
political meddling and it is something

516.149 --> 523.539
it really is and yeah these powers are

520.269 --> 526.839
nuclear both of them just thank God that

523.539 --> 529.39
they're not using that if it's real you

526.839 --> 533.3800000000001
can't say for sure let's just hope it

529.39 --> 538.029
isn't but it tends nevertheless and also

533.38 --> 543.579
in his article mention about yeah how

538.029 --> 547.1
Saudi Arabia is potentially getting

543.579 --> 549.019
nuclear capabilities apparently funneled

547.1 --> 554.2090000000001
through Pakistan I didn't know that

549.019 --> 556.3100000000001
angle yet it's good maybe it's rumor do

554.209 --> 559.16
they even say it's rumored so yeah

556.31 --> 562.43
God you know filling in the gaps of the

559.16 --> 564.05
narrative do have to realize yeah there

562.43 --> 567.8199999999999
is a narrative and a counter narrative

564.05 --> 571.779
and in ways they are both politicized

567.82 --> 575.1800000000001
it's so most impossible not to do it so

571.779 --> 579.76
how much of it is true can be confirmed

575.18 --> 583.9699999999999
how much of it is rumors that seem very

579.76 --> 587.269
likely you it's very hard to tell you

583.97 --> 590.0600000000001
know he can't just call up oh hey Secret

587.269 --> 591.79
Service can you please tell us what part

590.06 --> 593.959
of this is real and what isn't

591.79 --> 596.18
because yeah they're part of the

593.959 --> 599.5999999999999
narrative one way or the other so they

596.18 --> 601.91
will yeah nobody's gonna tell you the

599.6 --> 605.839
total absolute truth in these things

601.91 --> 610.93
it's it's all part of a game so yeah

605.839 --> 610.9300000000001
that's happening whoo

617.83 --> 626.89
and of course this is just released

622.74 --> 630.67
South America also stuff going on going

626.89 --> 633.67
down with from involvement with North

630.67 --> 635.9799999999999
Korea again and get a better feel of

633.67 --> 638.05
that there's also suspicions

635.98 --> 642.339
especially reflecting on the fenestella

638.05 --> 644.4699999999999
situation and people telling Kim Jong

642.339 --> 645.97
from a distance basically how you can't

644.47 --> 648.519
trust them if you're gonna do the way

645.97 --> 651.1
the nukes then they might do the same

648.519 --> 656.05
thing as with Qaddafi who also gave up

651.1 --> 658.8100000000001
his nukes and then yeah she came she saw

656.05 --> 663.519
and he died you know what happened that

658.81 --> 668.5889999999999
atrocity of history of recent history so

663.519 --> 673.39
yeah it stands it's complex it's the

668.589 --> 678.3100000000001
giant speed yes came which is unfolding

673.39 --> 680.61
right under our noses and it's big its

678.31 --> 680.6099999999999
massive

684.27 --> 693.49
and there's more of course there's the

690.01 --> 695.65
awakening awakening from the people side

693.49 --> 700.38
that that seems to be playing out at the

695.65 --> 707.68
same time I watched documentary

700.38 --> 711.22
concerning David Icke from 2015 and yeah

707.68 --> 716.53
I may have seen it before but it's just

711.22 --> 720.3100000000001
amazing how things even in the recent

716.53 --> 724.54
past just got this new layer of meaning

720.31 --> 727.4699999999999
this new tie in the synchronicity is

724.54 --> 732.03
coming together of all these things and

727.47 --> 735.4
it's just incredible it's all incredible

732.03 --> 738.13
like everybody had pieces of the puzzle

735.4 --> 742.09
and the puzzle is coming together from

738.13 --> 744.64
all sides oh yeah then of course there

742.09 --> 752.0500000000001
is the more recent documentary from

744.64 --> 757.47
Tommy Robinson how he basically went

752.05 --> 759.9699999999999
into Bieber's BBC covert

757.47 --> 762.58
journalistic operation from the people

759.97 --> 766.48
side and was very impressive like they

762.58 --> 769.72
really anticipated but people in the BBC

766.48 --> 771.57
do their tactics and and they yeah they

769.72 --> 775.0600000000001
tricked him they basically made him

771.57 --> 777.5500000000001
spill the beans on camera and then

775.06 --> 780.5999999999999
showed it to his face that guy was

777.55 --> 783.9699999999999
screwed he was screwed

780.6 --> 787.03
the Tommy got in a big time it was very

783.97 --> 789.76
impressive and a good point and it

787.03 --> 793.9599999999999
reflects back on even what happened a

789.76 --> 796.33
couple of days ago where remember how

793.96 --> 799.21
Bob was getting invitations to

796.33 --> 802.09
potentially do it documentary that from

799.21 --> 804.6700000000001
a separate Media Group but yet we talked

802.09 --> 806.2
about BBC BBC you know they have the

804.67 --> 807.52
final cut that they are going to do

806.2 --> 811.51
something with that

807.52 --> 817.89
and now Tommy shows it he shows it right

811.51 --> 817.89
there it's so amazing it's so amazing

820.17 --> 824.79
it all fits love it

828.11 --> 835.13
so yeah if you haven't seen that you

830.84 --> 839.69
know take a look at it I did post it in

835.13 --> 844.04
the chats that video you know what I'm

839.69 --> 848.72
gonna just post that video in bit chat

844.04 --> 853.49
right now it is a hour-long mini

848.72 --> 856.28
documentary but it is it is very

853.49 --> 858.14
interesting it's very with the nose on

856.28 --> 860.81
the detail so I do recommend that you

858.14 --> 863.3
watch it at some point maybe somewhere

860.81 --> 866.1999999999999
in the day it's pretty good it's very

863.3 --> 866.1999999999999
interesting

881.379 --> 884.7090000000001
all of it

885.74 --> 890.91
just makes

887.64 --> 893.96
my jaw drop in all

890.91 --> 893.9599999999999
of creation

894.07 --> 900.2
of

896.41 --> 904.149
how things fit together and

900.2 --> 908.1800000000001
how interesting all of these things are

904.149 --> 911.12
not just taken for face value but the

908.18 --> 913.6099999999999
complexities the motivations behind all

911.12 --> 916.43
of these actions all the parties that

913.61 --> 920.269
all have reasons for doing things the

916.43 --> 924.8
way they do whether their methodology be

920.269 --> 927.32
dark or pure freedom and light based

924.8 --> 929.3599999999999
they all have their reasons for doing

927.32 --> 936.49
what they do and it's all playing out

929.36 --> 936.49
and just wow creation man

937.99 --> 940.98
god is great

947.9 --> 953.43
let's hope

950.85 --> 956.87
we

953.43 --> 959.55
we all get out of it wiser the wiser and

956.87 --> 964.32
with not so much wreckage in the world

959.55 --> 968.3399999999999
let's hope that will not end up all

964.32 --> 969.5100000000001
imploding that will be terrible but I

968.34 --> 974.46
still have good hope

969.51 --> 977.91
just seeing the the intentions it's not

974.46 --> 981.4200000000001
just pure darkness really you know some

977.91 --> 983.85
people out there do this they they do

981.42 --> 988.4
seem to be religiously driven by the

983.85 --> 991.4
darkness but not all of them it's just

988.4 --> 991.4
fragments

994.86 --> 1002.72
ah anyway and yeah Harry's 101 I am

999.87 --> 1003.62
blowing my own mind but it's not really

1002.72 --> 1006.1700000000001
me doing it

1003.62 --> 1011.21
it's creation that's doing it and I'm

1006.17 --> 1014.18
seeing it yeah and it is kind of a bit

1011.21 --> 1018.9100000000001
of a monologue but it just I got a

1014.18 --> 1018.91
shared I got a share what I see

1021.54 --> 1024.56
and in a way

1026.35 --> 1030.6399999999999
it's it's all really a matter of

1028.42 --> 1032.8600000000001
perspective even to my own experience

1030.64 --> 1035.6200000000001
because like this ship was gone down

1032.86 --> 1038.32
like a month ago two months ago more in

1035.62 --> 1042.31
than in the winter I would have just

1038.32 --> 1048.58
done nuts like oh my god is so all gonna

1042.31 --> 1057.1599999999999
end and you know and I kind of did see

1048.58 --> 1059.11
that that's what got to me but now now

1057.16 --> 1061.15
there's the sunlight now there's this

1059.11 --> 1064.08
beautiful morning and it's funny because

1061.15 --> 1066.88
I reference it even yesterday like yeah

1064.08 --> 1072.12
glad the Sun is out there it really does

1066.88 --> 1072.1200000000001
help me handle all of this a lot better

1074.67 --> 1079.14
thank God for the sunlight as well

1079.85 --> 1084.08
and in the coming spring time that it's

1081.95 --> 1087.47
all coming it's all coming back the

1084.08 --> 1090.77
light is coming back and so is the

1087.47 --> 1094.4
beauty and and all the life and you know

1090.77 --> 1097.49
seeing new butts on the trees everywhere

1094.4 --> 1099.77
and it can't wait for that little tree

1097.49 --> 1101.45
down there to start to assuming again as

1099.77 --> 1106.01
it does every time they're in springtime

1101.45 --> 1111.73
it's so beautiful we get to see it every

1106.01 --> 1111.73
single year it's so amazing

1113.9 --> 1118.5800000000002
and good to hear all the birds just

1116.57 --> 1121.73
chirping out there doing their thing and

1118.58 --> 1127.1899999999998
yeah you know mating you know everything

1121.73 --> 1131.03
and doing their family rituals and also

1127.19 --> 1133.55
like I can feel it from the way they

1131.03 --> 1137.0
radiate that yeah they are also very

1133.55 --> 1139.22
happy that that they survived the winter

1137.0 --> 1146.96
and that spring is coming back and they

1139.22 --> 1151.15
can feel it as well this world is

1146.96 --> 1151.15
amazing it's absolutely amazing

1151.39 --> 1161.0490000000002
oh my god then we get into more Cletus

1156.37 --> 1165.1299999999999
hangout yesterday Jesus Martin what are

1161.049 --> 1171.61
you doing to us and that's a double

1165.13 --> 1174.22
meaning by the way because I'm seriously

1171.61 --> 1176.62
starting to wonder if if Martin can

1174.22 --> 1180.97
actually even handle the material he's

1176.62 --> 1182.6789999999999
being handed because I get the feeling

1180.97 --> 1185.049
more and more he's just trying to make

1182.679 --> 1190.0590000000002
some kind of sense out of it and

1185.049 --> 1201.1299999999999
narrative from it but it's so heavy and

1190.059 --> 1204.58
so bizarre and tragic and you know what

1201.13 --> 1212.22
those buildings photographs photographs

1204.58 --> 1216.9289999999999
of these massive wondrous buildings and

1212.22 --> 1216.929
and they're no longer there it's just

1219.22 --> 1225.43
it hurts it hurts me to know that these

1223.0 --> 1229.99
things have existed these absolute

1225.43 --> 1232.54
Marvel's that maybe even overshadow what

1229.99 --> 1235.44
is left of that culture right now and

1232.54 --> 1240.1299999999999
yeah what is left is still incredible

1235.44 --> 1243.49
but these buildings my god how are they

1240.13 --> 1248.25
made it I can't think of a way that

1243.49 --> 1252.49
humans could make that in a regular

1248.25 --> 1255.16
Mason masonry artistry fashion I just

1252.49 --> 1258.49
can't think of a way and I'm starting to

1255.16 --> 1267.19
wonder is that was that made through

1258.49 --> 1270.94
magic did they somehow use super-high

1267.19 --> 1273.3700000000001
wisdom and maybe some drugs involved and

1270.94 --> 1276.8500000000001
who knows what else comes in that to

1273.37 --> 1281.01
just make it crystallized like that on

1276.85 --> 1285.6699999999998
the spot just have the mud whatever

1281.01 --> 1288.79
there and just by force of will and

1285.67 --> 1292.9
frequency just make it crystallize the

1288.79 --> 1297.97
way it does because I that's the only

1292.9 --> 1299.92
thing I can think up its thought up to

1297.97 --> 1303.9
even conceptualize how something like

1299.92 --> 1303.9
that could be made it's just a miracle

1310.0 --> 1323.5
and who did that who did that

1313.86 --> 1325.99
you know who did that also it makes me

1323.5 --> 1329.19
reflect again on the whole concept art

1325.99 --> 1329.19
Aryans formation

1332.17 --> 1339.4
you know we we got

1334.75 --> 1342.39
ends of the methodology the darkness of

1339.4 --> 1344.3200000000002
the Four Nations the office darkness

1342.39 --> 1347.3700000000001
principalities of

1344.32 --> 1347.37
talk Aryans and

1348.27 --> 1356.07
but I get the feeling there is just so

1350.85 --> 1359.1599999999999
much more to it what they represent what

1356.07 --> 1366.33
they did what they do it seems like it's

1359.16 --> 1369.42
more than just 3d culture people through

1366.33 --> 1373.83
our time linearly there is something

1369.42 --> 1377.059
more to it there is this some kind of

1373.83 --> 1377.059
foundational role

1382.1 --> 1387.4299999999998
and yeah the the realization that the

1384.83 --> 1391.79
Phoenicians do seem to have their mark

1387.43 --> 1394.88
and so many things they were seemingly

1391.79 --> 1399.23
part of the creation process or maybe

1394.88 --> 1401.3000000000002
they just knew how to put literally a

1399.23 --> 1403.85
stamp on it like paint over it

1401.3 --> 1411.26
just give this extra signal like yeah we

1403.85 --> 1413.9599999999998
were here and why and I'm wondering now

1411.26 --> 1416.39
like even from a four-nation perspective

1413.96 --> 1422.3600000000001
like if the Phoenicians knew that they

1416.39 --> 1426.92
were culturally controlling the world

1422.36 --> 1431.1499999999999
and that the the others the other groups

1426.92 --> 1433.73
were by their own will destined to be

1431.15 --> 1436.94
destroyed were there Phoenicians that

1433.73 --> 1438.95
put their stamp on things to actually

1436.94 --> 1445.46
prevent them from being destroyed

1438.95 --> 1452.81
because they could not help but love the

1445.46 --> 1456.16
beauty of it for example just saying it

1452.81 --> 1456.1599999999999
just seems to be more to it

1456.46 --> 1464.409
I feel you hey yeah peanuts Clark hey

1460.99 --> 1468.73
man good timing for you to jump in kind

1464.409 --> 1472.5700000000002
of glad listen listen I did I ran into

1468.73 --> 1475.059
these articles and just that the world

1472.57 --> 1480.09
is crazy let me let me let you in on his

1475.059 --> 1485.9189999999999
articles okay which are so uh so at a

1480.09 --> 1489.009
disclosed location in the UK to animal

1485.919 --> 1491.259
rights protesters were protesting at a

1489.009 --> 1495.3990000000001
cruelty of sending pigs to a

1491.259 --> 1498.73
slaughterhouse and bond suddenly the

1495.399 --> 1501.369
pigs and all 2,000 of them escaped

1498.73 --> 1506.8890000000001
through a broken fence and stapled and

1501.369 --> 1511.119
killed the two protesters act on another

1506.889 --> 1513.34
woman a a woman came home to find her

1511.119 --> 1516.129
husband in the kitchen shaking

1513.34 --> 1518.1
frantically with what she had looked at

1516.129 --> 1522.129
what their wire running from his waist

1518.1 --> 1524.35
towards the electric kettle intending to

1522.129 --> 1526.629
jolt him away from the deadly current

1524.35 --> 1529.4499999999998
she whacked him with a handy click of

1526.629 --> 1532.84
wood to the back door breaking his arm

1529.45 --> 1536.759
into pieces until that moment he had

1532.84 --> 1536.759
been happily listening to his Walkman

1537.809 --> 1547.779

1544.69 --> 1549.8790000000001
confusing can you say that okay I'm

1547.779 --> 1552.159
trying to make a point to you okay these

1549.879 --> 1557.4599999999998
articles are fake but these articles

1552.159 --> 1561.009

1557.46 --> 1564.549
you're bringing me down by by me

1561.009 --> 1566.59
watching that and the whole intent of

1564.549 --> 1568.96
releasing those articles and for you to

1566.59 --> 1570.82
write them read them is to disempower

1568.96 --> 1573.509

1582.129 --> 1588.009
crazy and it's like dude you haven't

1584.74 --> 1588.53
confirmed any of that there's a reason

1588.009 --> 1591.5
it's called

1588.53 --> 1594.35
is controlling what like what like that

1591.5 --> 1598.7
footage of actual blown-up planes on the

1594.35 --> 1604.01
ground and [ __ ] was not real off those

1598.7 --> 1607.4
burn trucks that was all fake oh I don't

1604.01 --> 1611.81
trust anything that Liars tell me well

1607.4 --> 1615.3400000000001
he loves that everything a lie go go go

1611.81 --> 1619.85
in the woods in a mud hut and stay there

1615.34 --> 1622.9099999999999

1619.85 --> 1624.98
gonna get anywhere being fear poured by

1622.91 --> 1627.92
article fear point we're not talking

1624.98 --> 1630.17
about airport because why else would

1627.92 --> 1633.44
they tell us that what why else would I

1630.17 --> 1635.66
stuff happening so so all of a sudden

1633.44 --> 1637.94
liars are gonna tell us the truth why do

1635.66 --> 1639.16
you assume everything and everyone is

1637.94 --> 1644.2
liars

1639.16 --> 1647.9
anyone that has sold out to any type of

1644.2 --> 1650.15
mainstream answer to any type of script

1647.9 --> 1654.2900000000002
that is handed to him that's that's a

1650.15 --> 1657.1100000000001
liar how even though they have you know

1654.29 --> 1660.2
they write that it's from their

1657.11 --> 1662.4699999999998
symbolism from what they yeah I think

1660.2 --> 1665.42
you're being extremely

1662.47 --> 1670.52
overgeneralization say over generalizing

1665.42 --> 1672.92
here series okay well it it it it hurts

1670.52 --> 1674.54
my feelings to see you get upset over

1672.92 --> 1675.2
reading an article absolutely known

1674.54 --> 1679.97
liars

1675.2 --> 1683.48
yeah when did you watch my show when am

1679.97 --> 1685.8500000000001

you were like oh just creation it's just

1685.85 --> 1695.12
so daddy no oh no I did not I said it

1691.43 --> 1697.16
was amazing I didn't say it was bad I I

1695.12 --> 1699.9199999999998
really don't get where this angle is

1697.16 --> 1707.53
coming from I don't know it's really

1699.92 --> 1710.63
weird deduced negative 5i tell me this

1707.53 --> 1712.8799999999999
tell me this honor and and answer me

1710.63 --> 1716.1200000000001
honestly by me watching your show and

1712.88 --> 1719.0300000000002
you showing me articles that have not

1716.12 --> 1720.9799999999998
been verified by no enlarge what am I

1719.03 --> 1722.09
supposed to take out of that how am I

1720.98 --> 1727.58
supposed to start my day

1722.09 --> 1729.74
hearing about negative [ __ ] tell me how

1727.58 --> 1731.84
I'm supposed to approach this what am I

1729.74 --> 1734.1200000000001
supposed to do with it you got all these

1731.84 --> 1736.6599999999999
articles in Skype so what what am I

1734.12 --> 1740.3
supposed to do with it honestly tell me

1736.66 --> 1742.48
whatever you want okay so what is your

1740.3 --> 1745.73
intent behind it

1742.48 --> 1747.44
showing what's going on and and you

1745.73 --> 1749.48
believe it you've confirmed this you've

1747.44 --> 1751.94
went to Venezuela you've confirmed all

1749.48 --> 1754.25
this no yesterday no fragment no

1751.94 --> 1757.64
fragment oh okay

1754.25 --> 1760.52
but it's not nothing it's not just some

1757.64 --> 1762.8000000000002
virtual reality picture of which

1760.52 --> 1766.21
absolutely everything is totally 100%

1762.8 --> 1769.9099999999999
fake and to assume that is foolishness

1766.21 --> 1772.73
to assume however that it is 100% truth

1769.91 --> 1775.67
is foolishness as well that's the whole

1772.73 --> 1779.78
that's the trick you got to work your

1775.67 --> 1782.5
way through let me ask you this yes is

1779.78 --> 1785.51
it is it is it more is it dangerous for

1782.5 --> 1788.51
Humanity for someone's who otto believe

1785.51 --> 1790.37
whatever known liars tell them or is

1788.51 --> 1793.4
this better for or is it better for a

1790.37 --> 1798.61
person to say hey anything that they

1793.4 --> 1798.6100000000001
tell me is fake until it's proven real

1799.06 --> 1807.61
but that depends on what you let that

1803.12 --> 1810.08
stance propel you into doing because

1807.61 --> 1814.52
typically when people do that in

1810.08 --> 1817.01
themselves they don't pursue they don't

1814.52 --> 1818.84
actually go and figure out if it's real

1817.01 --> 1822.64
they just stay with the assumption no

1818.84 --> 1825.1699999999998
it's all fake and then they close off

1822.64 --> 1828.76
that's the basic reaction and that's

1825.17 --> 1828.76
what I'm actually trying to prevent

1829.32 --> 1836.02
and just like I'm watching you and I'm

1833.28 --> 1838.51
it's like you're showing this as if it's

1836.02 --> 1840.04
a fact you're not even letting you're

1838.51 --> 1842.17
not even letting your audience know hey

1840.04 --> 1844.84
this is just what known liars are

1842.17 --> 1847.8100000000002
telling us we haven't confirmed it you

1844.84 --> 1849.24
know I mean yes over here no there's no

1847.81 --> 1851.6499999999999
I'm not gonna do what a guy like

1849.24 --> 1853.78
everything and everyone out there lies

1851.65 --> 1856.8400000000001
you can only trust this guy

1853.78 --> 1858.8799999999999
no I'm not gonna do that it's ridiculous

1856.84 --> 1862.06
wait you're right it's your show you can

1858.88 --> 1864.49
do what you want but I just I don't know

1862.06 --> 1866.4099999999999
I don't like you're putting all this in

1864.49 --> 1869.77
skype you know which is cool I like I

1866.41 --> 1873.21
like information I just I want to know

1869.77 --> 1880.78
what you want me to do with this behold

1873.21 --> 1884.5900000000001
we go what it's so today while I'm at

1880.78 --> 1886.21
work I do I need to just go over in my

1884.59 --> 1888.34
mind all this bad [ __ ] that's happening

1886.21 --> 1890.52
in the world that depends if that is the

1888.34 --> 1895.06
angle you're gonna approach it with

1890.52 --> 1899.56
that's up to you or you could look at

1895.06 --> 1902.73
Wow look at this game being played out

1899.56 --> 1906.25
there and how complex is it really and

1902.73 --> 1909.48
what do all the involve people really

1906.25 --> 1913.06
want out of it why do they participate

1909.48 --> 1915.58
what's gonna be the result for them how

1913.06 --> 1918.6299999999999
is this gonna change all the maneuvering

1915.58 --> 1918.6299999999999
going around in the world

1926.59 --> 1933.9199999999998
it's complex notice it's not how I want

1929.78 --> 1936.41
to start my day hearing about its

1933.92 --> 1939.6200000000001
negative [ __ ] happening all the world

1936.41 --> 1940.5500000000002
that I cannot control there's nothing I

1939.62 --> 1943.55
could do about it

1940.55 --> 1946.22
that's wrong that's not true no there's

1943.55 --> 1947.56
nothing I can do yeah you can no you can

1946.22 --> 1953.92
yeah you can

1947.56 --> 1953.9199999999998
that's our Imam talking to you you can

1958.98 --> 1968.94
all I can do is leave that [ __ ] out

1966.509 --> 1970.47
of my mind and I can put positive

1968.94 --> 1972.809
thoughts in my mind and I can put a

1970.47 --> 1978.679
positive intent towards the other people

1972.809 --> 1982.19
around me in my local scenery thank you

1978.679 --> 1984.8400000000001
well that's a look that's good do that

1982.19 --> 1986.669
but wait so if I was to go to work and

1984.84 --> 1988.019
show everybody these articles is that

1986.669 --> 1991.46
gonna make them feel negative or

1988.019 --> 1997.71
positive it's gonna bring out a response

1991.46 --> 2001.22
and it's gonna basically probably if you

1997.71 --> 2003.499
do it reflect on people they're gonna

2001.22 --> 2004.94
crystallize in accordance to what is

2003.499 --> 2007.429
sort of happening and how they think

2004.94 --> 2009.799
they can interpret it there may be some

2007.429 --> 2013.489
polarization going on again but it's

2009.799 --> 2017.059
it'll be like a microcosm people are

2013.489 --> 2020.1390000000001
it's fascinating to figure it out it's

2017.059 --> 2020.139
just people do

2022.26 --> 2032.25
you know it's it's not it's not just bad

2027.179 --> 2036.3600000000001
and it's definitely not just good but it

2032.25 --> 2044.299
is something it's a lot of things in in

2036.36 --> 2049.02
2012 I I came home from work one day and

2044.299 --> 2051.57
almost on every channel there was a news

2049.02 --> 2057.359
story about some elementary kids that

2051.57 --> 2062.1000000000004
got shot at a elementary school I fell

2057.359 --> 2066.119
to my [ __ ] knees Arlen and I cried

2062.1 --> 2069.99
like a big [ __ ] baby and I let it

2066.119 --> 2071.79
ruin my whole week I even I even like

2069.99 --> 2077.52
wanted to send these parents the money I

2071.79 --> 2081.169
felt so bad I can't imagine two years

2077.52 --> 2084.169
later I found out that it was all

2081.169 --> 2084.169
[ __ ]

2085.56 --> 2091.139
so that's what any of their not baby

2087.659 --> 2095.31
that's right anything that no Liars tell

2091.139 --> 2098.04
me it's fake until they prove it's real

2095.31 --> 2100.77
right that's how I'm gonna be then

2098.04 --> 2101.64
that's good that's good but you gotta be

2100.77 --> 2106.41
careful

2101.64 --> 2109.25
you gotta be careful because just

2106.41 --> 2113.58
because a story painted around

2109.25 --> 2116.85
information and details can be faked or

2113.58 --> 2120.71
totally politicized or it doesn't mean

2116.85 --> 2120.71
that everything about it is fake

2121.85 --> 2128.31
just means there's been stuff added on

2125.07 --> 2132.54
to it and yeah when you talk about a

2128.31 --> 2135.33
fake school shooting that is obviously

2132.54 --> 2139.2599999999998
purely highlighted it's highlighted

2135.33 --> 2141.72
information emphasizing purely not on

2139.26 --> 2145.59
the mechanical structure of the events

2141.72 --> 2147.8999999999996
but on the concept on the tragedy so

2145.59 --> 2149.82
that is much more likely to be purely

2147.9 --> 2153.26
manipulative in nature in a very

2149.82 --> 2158.04
emotional way than for example complex

2153.26 --> 2162.4500000000003
geopolitical scenarios playing out and

2158.04 --> 2165.0299999999997
you you got distinguished you have to or

2162.45 --> 2171.21
you gotta walk away if you can't if you

2165.03 --> 2174.3
can't do it when I was a child I asked

2171.21 --> 2180.2400000000002
my dad one day I said I said how come

2174.3 --> 2183.1800000000003
the news is always bad minute you know

2180.24 --> 2184.5899999999997
and my dad told me you know there's a

2183.18 --> 2189.5099999999998
lot of bad people in the world or you

2184.59 --> 2192.81
know so so okay you know I always wonder

2189.51 --> 2196.5600000000004
why there's never any good news just a

2192.81 --> 2197.79
house doesn't stick no practical well

2196.56 --> 2200.07
well well

2197.79 --> 2202.5299999999997
good news also doesn't sell papers also

2200.07 --> 2204.57
- yeah but because what doesn't stick

2202.53 --> 2207.2900000000004
it's a statistical thing it's again

2204.57 --> 2211.4700000000003
corporate deduction ISM statistics

2207.29 --> 2213.18
that's what I choose that it's my also

2211.47 --> 2216.6299999999997
they're terrible side effect of

2213.18 --> 2220.62
corporate deduction ISM efficiency all

2216.63 --> 2222.75
right but I also I put two and two

2220.62 --> 2226.62
together because I got old enough to

2222.75 --> 2230.52
realize what was going on the reason why

2226.62 --> 2232.68
news is always bad it's because it's

2230.52 --> 2235.55
putting that negative vibration out

2232.68 --> 2240.1499999999996
there to the world and it's reminding

2235.55 --> 2243.3300000000004
every sleeping zombie out there that you

2240.15 --> 2248.01
do need big daddy government protecting

2243.33 --> 2249.5699999999997
you though they'll certainly try to

2248.01 --> 2254.6600000000003
suggest it yeah

2249.57 --> 2258.78
so just that that's the vibe that I got

2254.66 --> 2261.45
okay so I'm just being honest I care

2258.78 --> 2265.59
about you it's yourself you can show

2261.45 --> 2270.39
whatever article you want I will I know

2265.59 --> 2271.98
you will I just at least let your

2270.39 --> 2279.12
audience know that you haven't confirmed

2271.98 --> 2282.9900000000002
any of it well I kind of do that don't I

2279.12 --> 2286.5899999999997
you didn't today I did I did it in your

2282.99 --> 2289.8599999999997
aura see yesterday I do it every I never

2286.59 --> 2293.2200000000003
say this is real this is real I never do

2289.86 --> 2295.6200000000003
that I just say look at this what is

2293.22 --> 2298.5899999999997
going on there what are the political

2295.62 --> 2301.41
angles what is actually real about it

2298.59 --> 2303.9900000000002
and what is filler or politicized

2301.41 --> 2308.97
I absolutely emphasize that every single

2303.99 --> 2314.0699999999997
time because if I couldn't then it

2308.97 --> 2316.0499999999997
wasn't even interesting to me well thank

2314.07 --> 2318.6600000000003
you forgive me I didn't know so well

2316.05 --> 2322.0800000000004
thank you at least well you you air they

2318.66 --> 2323.8799999999997
got touched by our Iman and saw the

2322.08 --> 2329.88
daugther the dark side of it it's

2323.88 --> 2331.62
unfortunate you know it's weird you've

2329.88 --> 2337.4700000000003
been on my show a couple of times now

2331.62 --> 2341.0899999999997
and I'm just wondering like what is your

2337.47 --> 2344.4599999999996
job I don't think you ever told me

2341.09 --> 2348.4500000000003
that's what our head you had objections

2344.46 --> 2350.85
that didn't talk through with you about

2348.45 --> 2352.2599999999998
going to a job that seemed useless to

2350.85 --> 2353.43
you and then remind you yeah you're

2352.26 --> 2356.94
doing it for your family

2353.43 --> 2359.19
I'd have to continue so what what really

2356.94 --> 2364.68
is it what is it your job is what is it

2359.19 --> 2368.1
doing well so I was a certified master

2364.68 --> 2370.71
in mercedes-benz technician I have I was

2368.1 --> 2373.02
right move to another dealership and

2370.71 --> 2375.21
it's a it's a Toyota

2373.02 --> 2376.65
I work in automotive I will call corpse

2375.21 --> 2382.29
I'm not a mistake Misha

2376.65 --> 2385.9100000000003
okay so why do you get the feeling that

2382.29 --> 2385.91
that is so wrong somehow

2388.59 --> 2395.73
I don't get it I could because lot worse

2392.49 --> 2402.66
jobs to have really out there like yeah

2395.73 --> 2405.39
I mean I'm a bomb manufacturer for some

2402.66 --> 2406.02
big military industrial complex or

2405.39 --> 2409.44
something

2406.02 --> 2412.62
yeah that that's a job that really hits

2409.44 --> 2417.14
the conscious but making cars what's the

2412.62 --> 2422.7599999999998
problem with making cars so so uh

2417.14 --> 2426.75
basically automobiles have at least from

2422.76 --> 2428.1600000000003
my knowledge have for the last 80 to 100

2426.75 --> 2432.11
years have still been using the

2428.16 --> 2435.3599999999997
combustion engine right um

2432.11 --> 2441.75
therefore I know that the technology

2435.36 --> 2448.08
does exist to have electric right and I

2441.75 --> 2450.96
see that I feel as if technology that

2448.08 --> 2454.7999999999997
would benefit all of us is being put on

2450.96 --> 2460.26
the top step while we are being enslaved

2454.8 --> 2464.3
to use petroleum burning machines so the

2460.26 --> 2467.2200000000003
only reason that I have a job is because

2464.3 --> 2470.2400000000002
groups of sick individuals have decided

2467.22 --> 2474.02
to keep us with this hundred-year-old

2470.24 --> 2479.58
technology forcing us to pay for fuel

2474.02 --> 2483.03
forcing us to pay taxes on emissions so

2479.58 --> 2485.25
for that happy emission [ __ ] that is but

2483.03 --> 2488.94
I wouldn't want to blame that on cars I

2485.25 --> 2492.3
think that despite yeah fuel burning all

2488.94 --> 2493.42
that I think that even the combustion

2492.3 --> 2496.15
engine has made

2493.42 --> 2499.17
incredible technological progress over

2496.15 --> 2504.79
over the century that should not be

2499.17 --> 2508.29
overlooked and look about electrical

2504.79 --> 2511.799
cars they're not without problems okay

2508.29 --> 2516.46
they're not they still require energy

2511.799 --> 2520.99
creation and the batteries all that

2516.46 --> 2525.43
requires surprise specific metals and

2520.99 --> 2528.549
once again be the rare oils and

2525.43 --> 2530.5
everything that are very hard to come by

2528.549 --> 2536.0099999999998
when you compare it for example to steel

2530.5 --> 2539.799
and oil which is a plenty around so is

2536.01 --> 2542.28
electrical truly the ultimate step

2539.799 --> 2549.43
beyond that solved everything about

2542.28 --> 2551.8900000000003
gasoline cars I think I think because in

2549.43 --> 2556.18
a way you're right because in order to

2551.89 --> 2558.8489999999997
create the lithium-ion and or in order

2556.18 --> 2562.0299999999997
to create this electricity they have to

2558.849 --> 2567.4
burn more coal right it's all a problem

2562.03 --> 2570.849
just put in new coats right it's it's

2567.4 --> 2576.069
not really a solution I think that gas

2570.849 --> 2578.7400000000002
based trucks are really they can be very

2576.069 --> 2581.29
good can the in technology can even be

2578.74 --> 2584.319
further improved upon the biggest issue

2581.29 --> 2587.17
with me and fossil fuels all of them

2584.319 --> 2592.42
pretty much even coal have problems but

2587.17 --> 2594.339
it's it comes from the toxic waste side

2592.42 --> 2596.44
products that's where the real problem

2594.339 --> 2597.0099999999998
lies I've been trying to emphasize this

2596.44 --> 2600.309
forever

2597.01 --> 2602.38
like all this freakin co2 the co2 is

2600.309 --> 2605.799
like the only thing actually good coming

2602.38 --> 2607.69
from it besides yeah the use of the Mac

2605.799 --> 2611.02
mechanical properties and everything

2607.69 --> 2615.609
it's the toxins that's the problem but

2611.02 --> 2619.99
they all create that one way or the

2615.609 --> 2623.49
other but I don't see a problem with

2619.99 --> 2628.9799999999996
gasoline trucks they are actually quite

2623.49 --> 2632.0099999999998
an efficient and very useful for

2628.98 --> 2634.869
individuality and individual sovereignty

2632.01 --> 2638.92
because you can have like a gas tank

2634.869 --> 2641.349
full have it somewhere and the truck

2638.92 --> 2644.5
and society could like truly break down

2641.349 --> 2648.339
truly break down and you can go anywhere

2644.5 --> 2650.049
with that for a long time to come I

2648.339 --> 2652.5099999999998
tried to do that with an electric car

2650.049 --> 2654.0389999999998
where are you gonna load it what do you

2652.51 --> 2657.25
have a solar farm to do that or

2654.039 --> 2659.3190000000004
something you know if we breathe the

2657.25 --> 2661.839
gasoline and a truck you can have just

2659.319 --> 2663.2799999999997
the truck and a tank you can hide it

2661.839 --> 2665.02
nobody's gonna know if you're gonna have

2663.28 --> 2665.53
a solar farm yeah everybody will see

2665.02 --> 2672.299
that

2665.53 --> 2674.529
so look don't throw away all toys

2672.299 --> 2679.569
because you think something new is

2674.529 --> 2682.18
coming that will undo its necessity it's

2679.569 --> 2684.94
being improved upon it's made more

2682.18 --> 2688.0589999999997
efficient better it can still have a

2684.94 --> 2691.299
very viable function in this world for

2688.059 --> 2695.049
human beings sometimes I do get

2691.299 --> 2698.109
gratitude out of it because where I live

2695.049 --> 2700.18
a person if they want to commute they

2698.109 --> 2704.65
they either have to have a car or they

2700.18 --> 2707.319
have to ride the bus so a person's

2704.65 --> 2710.109
vehicle over here is one of their

2707.319 --> 2712.48
priorities and for me to be able to

2710.109 --> 2716.73
American you know long distances you got

2712.48 --> 2720.069
to have it right so for me to be able to

2716.73 --> 2722.68
keep a person door cuz without your car

2720.069 --> 2724.39
you you're really stuck you but you

2722.68 --> 2729.25
really can't do anything unless you have

2724.39 --> 2733.3289999999997
a bus pass like I said or a friend

2729.25 --> 2736.809
corporal so I do get gratitude sometimes

2733.329 --> 2740.42
also feeling like I am helping somebody

2736.809 --> 2741.6800000000003
with their daily commute because

2740.42 --> 2743.78
get to their job that I have to use

2741.68 --> 2746.12
their car therefore they have to bring

2743.78 --> 2749.3900000000003
it to me so alright and these cars

2746.12 --> 2751.79
require maintenance they require to be

2749.39 --> 2759.1099999999997
fixed they require people to understand

2751.79 --> 2761.06
how they work so I think your eye if I'd

2759.11 --> 2764.0
have your job I wouldn't feel bad about

2761.06 --> 2766.97
it at all really I actually be kind of

2764.0 --> 2775.28
proud of it you got a trait you you've

2766.97 --> 2776.81
got a a craft cars it's a craft I just

2775.28 --> 2781.9100000000003
got a raise yesterday I wanna watch

2776.81 --> 2783.86
something I got I got called into the

2781.91 --> 2786.23
office yesterday dude I thought I was in

2783.86 --> 2787.46
trouble yeah what did i do I was trying

2786.23 --> 2789.55
to contemplate I was thinking what

2787.46 --> 2794.06
didn't I do

2789.55 --> 2795.5600000000004
pulled out a sheet of paper like we're

2794.06 --> 2801.44
gonna raise you a dollar today it was

2795.56 --> 2803.54
like holy [ __ ] so awesome man

2801.44 --> 2805.01
congratulations I don't thank you so

2803.54 --> 2809.54
ratchets with your promotion it's

2805.01 --> 2812.0600000000004
awesome I still feel like a slave you

2809.54 --> 2815.72
know what in this world everyone is

2812.06 --> 2817.97
either at least a bit of a slave one way

2815.72 --> 2823.16
or the other it's just no real way

2817.97 --> 2827.83
around it but yeah you gotta find as

2823.16 --> 2827.83
much freedom within that as you can

2829.83 --> 2838.41
just manage your dependencies that's no

2832.89 --> 2841.3799999999997
bright words you know and I I can see

2838.41 --> 2844.56
how because a lot of people have told me

2841.38 --> 2846.33
you know it's like you know thinking

2844.56 --> 2851.79
that the earth is flat can be dangerous

2846.33 --> 2855.92
you know and in a way maybe it is

2851.79 --> 2860.25
because it's made me not trust anymore

2855.92 --> 2864.96
you know like I don't trust anything

2860.25 --> 2866.49
right yeah but I don't know how you get

2864.96 --> 2867.18
that I don't know if I can never get

2866.49 --> 2870.0499999999997
that back

2867.18 --> 2873.45
you can absolutely and you need to

2870.05 --> 2876.36
because I've been trying to say this

2873.45 --> 2880.0499999999997
like all throughout the Hangout it's you

2876.36 --> 2884.46
can't just over generalize realize that

2880.05 --> 2888.42
much of what people deal with is just

2884.46 --> 2891.09
trusting something above been above them

2888.42 --> 2893.64
and not really figuring out or even

2891.09 --> 2897.03
realize what about it is a lie it's just

2893.64 --> 2899.25
going with the flow and you can't just

2897.03 --> 2904.2200000000003
because you know that air is almost lies

2899.25 --> 2904.22
in everything then just blame the people

2904.49 --> 2910.5
for being the liars because most of them

2907.47 --> 2913.5499999999997
probably don't even know or they can't

2910.5 --> 2917.93
know they can't get themselves to see it

2913.55 --> 2917.9300000000003
because they don't want to be liars

2919.65 --> 2929.5
but uh I said before on this show that

2925.99 --> 2934.45
you know four years ago I may have been

2929.5 --> 2941.579
asleep but I was happy and I had no

2934.45 --> 2941.5789999999997
paranoia now I can't get away from it

2943.95 --> 2950.4399999999996
and it doesn't it doesn't really help

2947.77 --> 2955.29
with me because I've always kind of had

2950.44 --> 2955.29
a temper I get it from my father so

2955.319 --> 2961.0299999999997
that's why I smoke a lot of weed cuz the

2958.81 --> 2962.069
weed how am L the weed knows me I would

2961.03 --> 2970.78
bring me

2962.069 --> 2973.75
it helps careful with that because with

2970.78 --> 2975.55
me not saying that it works exactly the

2973.75 --> 2981.66
same you know cannabis works differently

2975.55 --> 2985.15
with it every person but I find that

2981.66 --> 2989.77
smoking cannabis like on the long run

2985.15 --> 2993.76
actually aggravates paranoia subtle in a

2989.77 --> 2996.099
subtle way like raises the tone maybe

2993.76 --> 3001.71
it's because I see more can't get away

2996.099 --> 3004.4700000000003
from it because of that but you might

3001.71 --> 3008.819
want to cut down a bit just to try it

3004.47 --> 3010.74
out cuz for me in the last few months

3008.819 --> 3014.069
yeah I have smoked cannabis here and

3010.74 --> 3017.1899999999996
there but I'm like this is not helping

3014.069 --> 3020.91
it it just it seems to be like a

3017.19 --> 3024.44
temporary escape thing but then it turns

3020.91 --> 3024.44
out to actually make things worse

3025.33 --> 3032.21
so Minister maybe maybe I just have a

3029.06 --> 3034.73
really high tolerance because you know

3032.21 --> 3037.37
like when some people smoke weed they

3034.73 --> 3042.11
they do get paranoid and they they gave

3037.37 --> 3044.24
they giggle and laugh you know like weed

3042.11 --> 3046.6400000000003
hasn't made me laugh in a long time like

3044.24 --> 3048.83
I don't I don't find things to be funny

3046.64 --> 3056.2599999999998
you know what I mean like what I'm hard

3048.83 --> 3058.85
I'm just so like why do you do it then

3056.26 --> 3064.76
because if for some reason if I don't

3058.85 --> 3075.44
smoke I get really I get what do you

3064.76 --> 3077.36
call it irritated irritated and right so

3075.44 --> 3079.31
maybe it's just my fallback maybe maybe

3077.36 --> 3082.1
in my mind I'm just thinking that it's

3079.31 --> 3085.94
helping me but well look getting

3082.1 --> 3090.86
irritated is generally in the counts for

3085.94 --> 3094.25
almost anything is a sign of retraction

3090.86 --> 3098.27
is a sign that there is some kind of

3094.25 --> 3101.51
metabolic Oh addiction going on and it's

3098.27 --> 3104.33
like a withdrawal symptom so maybe you

3101.51 --> 3107.5400000000004
should try at some point if you can find

3104.33 --> 3110.7799999999997
the room cuz ya need to be careful with

3107.54 --> 3113.33
that you might have unforeseen responses

3110.78 --> 3115.07
from the inside tried to actually sit

3113.33 --> 3119.86
through it and see what happens

3115.07 --> 3119.86
if you try to sit through that agitation

3120.93 --> 3128.3689999999997
and basically accept it try to work it

3125.46 --> 3131.599
through it get to the other side and

3128.369 --> 3134.759
have a period where are you not smoking

3131.599 --> 3136.7400000000002
to test it to test what it really does

3134.759 --> 3139.109
with you because if you're gonna smoke

3136.74 --> 3143.0389999999998
every single day and especially a lot

3139.109 --> 3147.0589999999997
yet it's gonna have impact on you so you

3143.039 --> 3149.46
gotta learn about what it does to you

3147.059 --> 3154.67
and one of the ways to do it is to

3149.46 --> 3156.15
actually quit and just see what happens

3154.67 --> 3158.13
all right

3156.15 --> 3161.359
maybe you'll actually find some peace

3158.13 --> 3164.1600000000003
back after you get through the agitation

3161.359 --> 3167.16
you might want to try it but be careful

3164.16 --> 3170.999
you know sounds like I would have to

3167.16 --> 3172.47
take week off the work maybe I'd rather

3170.999 --> 3182.9399999999996
go back to the ball and quit smoking

3172.47 --> 3187.319
weed that's not a good sign since I was

3182.94 --> 3189.63
16 yeah like it's just been my daily

3187.319 --> 3193.499
routine since I was 16 years old

3189.63 --> 3197.579
daily routine since I was 16 yeah but is

3193.499 --> 3202.009
really routine or a crutch you know you

3197.579 --> 3202.009
gotta you gotta test yourself

3209.19 --> 3213.81
be the master of your body

3214.5 --> 3220.78
you make it sound easy no it's not

3217.57 --> 3223.96
I'm know if it sounds like it's easy

3220.78 --> 3229.3900000000003
it's not but I do know how it works

3223.96 --> 3232.06
because I've done it okay I have had

3229.39 --> 3233.89
long long periods of completely not

3232.06 --> 3236.83
smoking cannabis for good reasons

3233.89 --> 3239.29
because it was having detrimental

3236.83 --> 3243.22
effects on me at the time it's very

3239.29 --> 3248.95
specific but I quit like five years

3243.22 --> 3250.3599999999997
straight at some point five years oh but

3248.95 --> 3254.08
that kind of sounds like maybe you

3250.36 --> 3256.48
needed to talk to your dealer no I have

3254.08 --> 3258.2799999999997
no leader did you try a different their

3256.48 --> 3260.77
scuffle herbs here everywhere I have no

3258.28 --> 3265.11
dealer on all sides at the time when I

3260.77 --> 3268.45
was actually growing my own so are you

3265.11 --> 3270.9100000000003
not it's not about the cannabis source

3268.45 --> 3273.96
it's about the effect of cannabis in

3270.91 --> 3273.96
general on you

3276.349 --> 3280.549
Thank You Harlan and I do have to go to

3279.919 --> 3282.3799999999997
work

3280.549 --> 3285.349
alright fortunately yeah thank you for

3282.38 --> 3287.6890000000003
coming in and listen you forgive me a

3285.349 --> 3289.909
man it's a go ahead you're putting your

3287.689 --> 3292.939
heart out there and I do appreciate the

3289.909 --> 3296.529
directness and the honesty I'm just

3292.939 --> 3300.799
saying that try not to over generalize

3296.529 --> 3304.519
and that's is just a system rule right

3300.799 --> 3307.669
it was like like I could like almost

3304.519 --> 3309.2889999999998
feel your energy as it was like bringing

3307.669 --> 3310.8489999999997
your spirits down and then it started

3309.289 --> 3314.2990000000004
bringing my Spurs down and then I got

3310.849 --> 3317.509
triggered so forgive me

3314.299 --> 3320.869
I just that's I have a hard time

3317.509 --> 3325.789
trusting anybody after I realized I

3320.869 --> 3330.4990000000003
didn't logic about where I live yeah I

3325.789 --> 3333.949
had a very hard time with trust I don't

3330.499 --> 3334.339
even trust my own father no that's not

3333.949 --> 3341.119
good

3334.339 --> 3343.009
well he's not a good person okay I don't

3341.119 --> 3346.279
know I just like to say you can only

3343.009 --> 3350.509
trust people as far as you understand

3346.279 --> 3356.359
what drives them and then you can trust

3350.509 --> 3360.979
in what you know they want that's how I

3356.359 --> 3363.38
learned to re-establish some kind of

3360.979 --> 3367.7889999999998
trust I basically trust my senses and

3363.38 --> 3371.839
understanding about other people so I

3367.789 --> 3374.509
will know what they will do and yeah and

3371.839 --> 3377.5589999999997
if I turn out to be wrong yeah I will

3374.509 --> 3377.559
figure that out eventually

3378.029 --> 3382.709
where the hell is Rhys when you need him

3380.129 --> 3384.719
uh that's not fair because every

3382.709 --> 3387.359
actually wanted to come on the show to

3384.719 --> 3393.949
present something but I told him like

3387.359 --> 3398.219
now maybe a little later he wanted to

3393.949 --> 3401.569
share something about wanted to discuss

3398.219 --> 3404.219
Hiroshima so maybe about the fake nuke

3401.569 --> 3408.509
situation it's a good topic to talk

3404.219 --> 3410.339
about it's much to discuss so I think

3408.509 --> 3412.699
I'm probably gonna do that the next show

3410.339 --> 3415.519
sorry Rhys sorry man

3412.699 --> 3419.129
shut out the reefs indeed Charlotte

3415.519 --> 3425.2189999999996
definitely Therese awesome guy he really

3419.129 --> 3430.649
does know how to how to shine the light

3425.219 --> 3433.919
and bring peace he's he's hit rock

3430.649 --> 3437.459
bottom and gotten that t-shirt now he's

3433.919 --> 3437.819
helping others you know you know what I

3437.459 --> 3441.359
mean

3437.819 --> 3446.579
someone who's been there and now has

3441.359 --> 3448.769
faced face the as you would call him you

3446.579 --> 3454.4990000000003
know he would call them demons you know

3448.769 --> 3456.5089999999996
I just think it's negative energy but I

3454.499 --> 3462.419
can I can relate to race he's a good guy

3456.509 --> 3465.029
yes and whether he be good or or

3462.419 --> 3466.769
something else he is doing good there

3465.029 --> 3470.609
are and that's what really counts that's

3466.769 --> 3472.64
how you should be judging people by what

3470.609 --> 3476.0299999999997
they do

3472.64 --> 3481.22
I think I can trust fries maybe

3476.03 --> 3483.7400000000002
I just have a hard time I have a hard

3481.22 --> 3490.1299999999997
time trusting people it's perfectly

3483.74 --> 3493.04
understandable and yeah I trust reason

3490.13 --> 3496.4900000000002
to be Reese and to do what he does and

3493.04 --> 3499.15
do it eloquently but yeah to be fair he

3496.49 --> 3502.85
lives on the other side of the globe

3499.15 --> 3505.4300000000003
just getting very far away and yeah I

3502.85 --> 3508.04
don't know much about him really except

3505.43 --> 3513.2799999999997
for what he shares with us right and

3508.04 --> 3513.2799999999997
he's focusing a lot on the message and

3513.85 --> 3519.77
yeah we'll figure it out

3517.16 --> 3522.3999999999996
maybe I will get to know him a lot

3519.77 --> 3524.78
better at some point we will meet him

3522.4 --> 3528.2000000000003
