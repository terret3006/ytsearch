I was gonna say it is Thursday the 17th

241.379 --> 247.14
of November 2022

244.26 --> 249.599
and hello logical observations first in

247.14 --> 252.55999999999997
chat Mike zadunich good to see you

249.599 --> 252.56
Supreme knowing

254.04 --> 261.99899999999997
how are you all doing

255.61 --> 261.999
[Music]

264.6 --> 270.54
I feel weird

267.18 --> 273.479
but I can't put my finger on it like

270.54 --> 277.40000000000003
what it's not like cranky or sad or it's

273.479 --> 277.4
just you know weird

280.199 --> 284.54
oh LSG let's see you

285.3 --> 291.18
all right so yeah right before the show

287.4 --> 296.0
I was kind of rounding up

291.18 --> 296.0
uh video I was watching from mine unveil

301.68 --> 304.979
and it's really good

303.9 --> 307.979
foreign

304.979 --> 311.34
I mean it's like one of the most

307.979 --> 314.96
detailed presentations about

311.34 --> 318.38
photo editing that I've ever seen

314.96 --> 318.38
really good

319.32 --> 323.3
and very clarifying

323.34 --> 329.039
so I definitely recommend everybody

325.44 --> 330.36
watches that at some point

329.039 --> 334.28999999999996
here's the link

330.36 --> 334.29
[Music]

335.52 --> 340.039
I mean this is just a full-blown

337.56 --> 343.639
presentation

340.039 --> 343.639
it is really good

346.199 --> 351.36
and it like it

347.88 --> 353.639
the way what he actually explains really

351.36 --> 356.46000000000004
will help you if you have the kind of

353.639 --> 358.32
talent for that spotting kind of thing

356.46 --> 361.25899999999996
it will help you

358.32 --> 363.18
to basically see where the trigger is

361.259 --> 364.91900000000004
the funny thing is that I've kind of

363.18 --> 367.62
been doing this

364.919 --> 369.419
with some of Martin's uh presentations

367.62 --> 372.96
where he's just like

369.419 --> 375.78
getting stuff and showing it

372.96 --> 379.88
I would already kind of have

375.78 --> 379.88
the eye to spot these types of things

381.66 --> 386.40000000000003
but it's really awesome to just have

383.759 --> 388.68
somebody like really explain it like

386.4 --> 391.44
with historical backing like full

388.68 --> 393.66
historical backing maximum it's really

391.44 --> 397.5
fascinating

393.66 --> 400.97900000000004
and also basically reveals that

397.5 --> 404.4
well photo editing

400.979 --> 408.78
like analog photo editing

404.4 --> 412.13899999999995
had been like a super powerful kindness

408.78 --> 415.94
secret propaganda tool

412.139 --> 417.72
for politicians and Bank yeah

415.94 --> 419.46
oligarchs

417.72 --> 420.96000000000004
robber barons

419.46 --> 424.039
probably

420.96 --> 424.039
for quite a while

424.62 --> 428.759
and it really does start to shine

426.96 --> 431.69899999999996
through that yeah

428.759 --> 434.699
I mean probably quite a few people had

431.699 --> 437.66
been like framed using this kind of

434.699 --> 440.28000000000003
photograph [ __ ]

437.66 --> 443.12
this there's a likelihood to that that

440.28 --> 443.11999999999995
had happened

443.52 --> 449.65999999999997
right so really fascinating video

446.34 --> 449.65999999999997
definitely check it out

449.73 --> 454.88
[Music]

452.4 --> 454.88
right

457.02 --> 459.979
so how are you doing

462.24 --> 465.199
uh

467.34 --> 471.29999999999995
yesterday were all kinds of streams

469.44 --> 474.78
again

471.3 --> 478.139
in this case I mostly

474.78 --> 479.71999999999997
stuck with Jim Bob

478.139 --> 483.24
was hilarious

479.72 --> 486.96000000000004
[Music]

483.24 --> 490.199
I mean he he just finds these people and

486.96 --> 493.5
gets like men just Allure them on his

490.199 --> 496.139
on this show and it is just it's so

493.5 --> 497.819
funny where he like he manages to find

496.139 --> 500.16
these types of people

497.819 --> 504.319
so yeah that was really hilarious in

500.16 --> 504.319
chat again with Jim Bob

531.18 --> 534.18
right

543.48 --> 546.559
[Music]

549.24 --> 553.519
yeah also more own Benjamin

555.24 --> 559.1
he's really on a roll I feel

567.54 --> 570.4399999999999
all right

577.68 --> 581.899
hey fiber outs good to see you

581.97 --> 586.74
[Music]

589.44 --> 593.3290000000001
[Music]

602.64 --> 609.06
right so any feedback guys what are you

606.24 --> 612.0
up to or maybe it's like super shitty

609.06 --> 613.6199999999999
wetter over there too it it seemed to be

612.0 --> 616.62
the last few days

613.62 --> 619.38
for you guys

616.62 --> 622.86
well I I kind of get it how you're then

619.38 --> 625.019
less inclined to just be chatty

622.86 --> 627.0
right but I don't want any more like

625.019 --> 630.44
five minutes of silence in the chat

627.0 --> 630.44
that's just too much

631.08 --> 634.22
if all possible

644.7 --> 649.86
all right so the title of today's show

646.8 --> 652.3199999999999
is kind of generic in a way but all

649.86 --> 654.25
right yeah it's becoming that you know

652.32 --> 655.74
it's fake because it looks so real

654.25 --> 658.5
[Music]

655.74 --> 661.94
while referencing to a couple of moments

658.5 --> 661.94
over at platzoids

662.64 --> 668.16
where they would like you would get to

664.98 --> 671.88
see the supposed footage of the launch

668.16 --> 674.579
of Artemis and and then yeah

671.88 --> 677.82
they would switch to like more beautiful

674.579 --> 681.7199999999999
pictures and they were like all very

677.82 --> 684.86
blatantly oh are yeah are

681.72 --> 687.24
tested up

684.86 --> 690.3000000000001
Aesthetics added

687.24 --> 691.98
so yeah conclusion you know it's fake

690.3 --> 695.5999999999999
because it looks so real because they

691.98 --> 695.6
just make it look like oh yeah

697.2 --> 703.0490000000001
yeah so that's that

699.82 --> 703.0490000000001
[Music]

705.73 --> 714.039
[Music]

714.98 --> 720.38

717.66 --> 720.38
pretty much open

720.72 --> 724.86
talking about whatever

749.88 --> 755.88
uh

752.7 --> 759.779
right anyway I haven't continued

755.88 --> 762.779

[Music]

839.639 --> 846.019

843.0 --> 846.019
present that

846.6 --> 852.5600000000001
that's really funny thank you for

848.579 --> 852.56
bringing that to my attention turret

879.779 --> 882.68
foreign

887.1 --> 890.899
yeah that should do right

894.72 --> 902.76
right so this is a video an official

898.199 --> 905.88
video from World Government Summit

902.76 --> 907.74
and the video

905.88 --> 909.8389999999999
is titled

907.74 --> 913.6800000000001
oh hold on

909.839 --> 916.339
as are we ready for a new world order

913.68 --> 919.8
and then there is a YouTube

916.339 --> 922.74
Wikipedia Auto warning

919.8 --> 926.76
the New World Order is a conspiracy

922.74 --> 930.98
theory which hypothesizes a secret

926.76 --> 930.98
emerging to Italian world government

932.779 --> 937.22
uh thank you for that tared

939.18 --> 943.0999999999999
that's just brilliant

944.82 --> 951.36
hmm

947.24 --> 951.36
[Music]

961.89 --> 965.08

[Music]

978.53 --> 981.8299999999999
[Applause]

998.759 --> 1003.139
it also matches the show too yeah yeah

1000.98 --> 1004.82
good one no thank you Terry I I kind of

1003.139 --> 1008.139
needed that

1004.82 --> 1008.139
and it's funny

1008.48 --> 1014.48
I mean

1010.1 --> 1018.339
the world cannot be that bad if these

1014.48 --> 1018.339
things just automatically happen

1018.68 --> 1021.2199999999999
right

1023.779 --> 1030.98
it just means that the elites

1027.679 --> 1033.8600000000001
have set out just propaganda or like

1030.98 --> 1036.919
censorship systems sort of

1033.86 --> 1039.62
but they they can't even properly wield

1036.919 --> 1043.1000000000001
them without accidentally making them

1039.62 --> 1046.52
screw yeah screw up

1043.1 --> 1049.12
when for their own use I mean that is

1046.52 --> 1049.12
just funny

1049.34 --> 1055.1789999999999
anyway

1051.559 --> 1055.1789999999999
thank you for that so

1061.49 --> 1064.96
[Music]

1070.2 --> 1074.93
[Music]

1081.32 --> 1084.32
foreign

1098.679 --> 1105.73
is dangerous now what

1103.4 --> 1120.679
what are you talking about

1105.73 --> 1123.4
[Music]

1120.679 --> 1123.4
no

1124.48 --> 1130.22
I'm not afraid of AI

1128.299 --> 1133.12
I mean it's just a system doing what

1130.22 --> 1133.1200000000001
it's programmed to do

1134.419 --> 1139.2990000000002
know the programmer and you know the

1137.059 --> 1139.299
program

1140.419 --> 1146.3200000000002
the thing that Tron got right

1143.36 --> 1146.32
with its lore

1146.99 --> 1150.039
[Music]

1156.559 --> 1160.34
because it couldn't catch the contact

1158.24 --> 1164.179
yeah of course it can't catch the

1160.34 --> 1166.6399999999999
context I mean the idea of like oh no

1164.179 --> 1170.0
these people

1166.64 --> 1173.66
can say whatever they want but these

1170.0 --> 1175.76
other people they have to be getting the

1173.66 --> 1178.4
procedure

1175.76 --> 1180.86
that's like how's the AI even picking up

1178.4 --> 1182.24
on that like how does it know the

1180.86 --> 1184.6999999999998
difference

1182.24 --> 1186.86
to when it should be doing that and when

1184.7 --> 1188.96
it shouldn't right I mean you'll have to

1186.86 --> 1192.32
go as far as to the like it literally

1188.96 --> 1194.24
insert word coding but yeah then people

1192.32 --> 1196.8799999999999
online will figure that out and we'll

1194.24 --> 1199.88
just start to mimic it so

1196.88 --> 1202.1200000000001
they can't make exceptions to their own

1199.88 --> 1202.1200000000001
[ __ ]

1202.22 --> 1207.8600000000001
that's the inevitable problem

1205.039 --> 1209.36
that they've gotten themselves into with

1207.86 --> 1211.6999999999998
this system

1209.36 --> 1214.299
and that's funny

1211.7 --> 1214.299
yeah

1216.679 --> 1220.9
anyway hello flutter Sage good to see

1218.78 --> 1220.8999999999999

1278.72 --> 1284.679

1281.84 --> 1284.6789999999999

1353.78 --> 1360.1399999999999
about seven and a half minutes ago

1357.08 --> 1362.4399999999998
if you scroll back from the light

1360.14 --> 1362.44
stream

1362.96 --> 1369.039
I showed it on screen letter Sage if you

1366.32 --> 1369.039
want to check it out

1371.08 --> 1374.23
[Music]

1376.82 --> 1388.1899999999998
[Music]

1406.88 --> 1411.44
right the otherwise did this yeah the

1409.34 --> 1414.799
well the only way they could ever even

1411.44 --> 1416.059
bypass it and it probably will some

1414.799 --> 1420.44
point

1416.059 --> 1422.6589999999999
if it even keeps continuing that long

1420.44 --> 1425.8400000000001
the only way to really bypass it is if

1422.659 --> 1428.48
you make like a special

1425.84 --> 1429.74
separate type of YouTube account like a

1428.48 --> 1431.8600000000001
news channel

1429.74 --> 1434.0
that just gets

1431.86 --> 1436.6399999999999
complete cover

1434.0 --> 1438.919
right so that the rules are slightly

1436.64 --> 1440.8400000000001
different for them and then you can

1438.919 --> 1444.919
basically exempt that entire channel

1440.84 --> 1446.6589999999999
from ever having the algorithm touch it

1444.919 --> 1449.65
like that

1446.659 --> 1450.919
for people right

1449.65 --> 1453.0800000000002
[Music]

1450.919 --> 1455.0
so you can have like an official Channel

1453.08 --> 1457.6999999999998
release where they just do talk about

1455.0 --> 1461.12
New World Order and all that [ __ ]

1457.7 --> 1463.7
without any comments to it because well

1461.12 --> 1465.3799999999999
the algorithm knows like this is an

1463.7 --> 1467.419
official Channel That's supposed to be

1465.38 --> 1470.5590000000002
saying that

1467.419 --> 1474.919
and not some guy on YouTube

1470.559 --> 1477.5
Bringing up a clip of him right because

1474.919 --> 1480.2
that's the issue they can't right now

1477.5 --> 1484.04
there's no difference because there's no

1480.2 --> 1486.0800000000002
specific designated exemption system

1484.04 --> 1491.299
[Music]

1486.08 --> 1492.49
I want to set that you don't unset that

1491.299 --> 1495.749
anyway

1492.49 --> 1495.749
[Music]

1502.76 --> 1505.9
It's a pasta right

1514.59 --> 1521.12
[Music]

1518.5 --> 1523.159
yeah but it's yeah it doesn't matter

1521.12 --> 1526.3999999999999
they could probably fix it it's still

1523.159 --> 1529.1200000000001
funny it's just freaking funny

1526.4 --> 1529.1200000000001
see that

1534.799 --> 1539.48
it's like they built that trap for us

1537.62 --> 1542.4799999999998
for everybody

1539.48 --> 1544.58
and then they accidentally step into

1542.48 --> 1548.32
their own set traps that's what it's

1544.58 --> 1548.32
like and that's just funny anyway

1549.47 --> 1553.68
[Music]

1576.02 --> 1578.679
foreign

1578.97 --> 1584.5
[Music]

1581.72 --> 1584.5
what you got

1586.6 --> 1589.83
[Music]

1595.1 --> 1601.82
oh video froze I think yep

1599.48 --> 1604.76
man

1601.82 --> 1607.82
my tech is certainly

1604.76 --> 1609.919
playing up today

1607.82 --> 1612.6399999999999
I guess my computer doesn't really like

1609.919 --> 1612.64
this weather either

1636.919 --> 1651.989
right so come on guys give me something

1642.27 --> 1651.989
[Music]

1655.58 --> 1662.1789999999999
YouTube restrict earlier yeah that's a

1659.24 --> 1665.419
good point but yeah I mean

1662.179 --> 1667.88
these types of measures

1665.419 --> 1670.5200000000002
have their moments like it's like

1667.88 --> 1673.0590000000002
decided like okay now you can't talk

1670.52 --> 1673.059
about that

1674.299 --> 1680.779
right that's and then

1676.94 --> 1684.2
after like a month or two then it just

1680.779 --> 1687.559
stops again they just turn it off again

1684.2 --> 1690.2
because like the it's really like a a

1687.559 --> 1692.059
wave breaker system that's how they use

1690.2 --> 1694.279
it they they want to use it like a wave

1692.059 --> 1696.46
breaker system right you know what that

1694.279 --> 1696.46
is

1697.46 --> 1701.6000000000001
like this obstacle

1701.96 --> 1708.02
that they put there at certain beaches

1705.74 --> 1709.4
where the waves can get really freaking

1708.02 --> 1713.0
big

1709.4 --> 1715.4
and it just like it's taking away of the

1713.0 --> 1716.96
momentum

1715.4 --> 1718.7
and that's what they want to do with it

1716.96 --> 1721.159
so yeah that's

1718.7 --> 1724.5800000000002
this is the way to do it this is to turn

1721.159 --> 1727.0390000000002
it into a wave Breakers by yeah oh the

1724.58 --> 1729.02
current thing oh they're rolling out a

1727.039 --> 1732.14
complete [ __ ] mind control scheme

1729.02 --> 1734.0
well don't talk about it the moment they

1732.14 --> 1736.3400000000001
do that because they got the wave

1734.0 --> 1739.58
breakers out as soon as you address it

1736.34 --> 1741.32
you're gonna be taken out of the picture

1739.58 --> 1744.32
I mean they might delete your account

1741.32 --> 1745.82
for it it'll go that far

1744.32 --> 1747.559
right

1745.82 --> 1750.32
it's the wavebreaker system because if

1747.559 --> 1752.539
they don't do that then literally just

1750.32 --> 1754.6399999999999
one person rolls in

1752.539 --> 1757.76
just happens to say the right

1754.64 --> 1758.8990000000001
combination of insights the the right

1757.76 --> 1761.419
way

1758.899 --> 1764.779
with the smooth tongue and suddenly like

1761.419 --> 1767.24
millions and millions of people rapidly

1764.779 --> 1770.539
figure this out and start spreading it

1767.24 --> 1774.22
right that's why they do it

1770.539 --> 1774.22
is the wave breaker system

1774.98 --> 1779.539
but yeah it seems like they occasionally

1777.44 --> 1782.6200000000001
bump into their own weight right Chris

1779.539 --> 1782.62
too so

1782.899 --> 1788.36
yes it is fed was good yeah yeah no fd's

1786.32 --> 1790.399
been good for a while and it's like

1788.36 --> 1793.1
getting better

1790.399 --> 1794.36
but yesterday was hilarious reviewing

1793.1 --> 1797.12
that old

1794.36 --> 1799.1589999999999
that older video with these numpy flat

1797.12 --> 1802.6999999999998
earthers

1799.159 --> 1805.0390000000002
that yeah it was very interesting

1802.7 --> 1808.159
I and I think that Nathan's gonna do

1805.039 --> 1809.96
this sort of thing more often because

1808.159 --> 1812.659
we haven't really

1809.96 --> 1814.7
you could almost say like maybe Patricia

1812.659 --> 1816.679
stair held him back a bit

1814.7 --> 1818.419
because Patricia stairs message would

1816.679 --> 1822.02
always be like don't

1818.419 --> 1823.7
just leave the Flat Earth or alone

1822.02 --> 1825.679
let them have their own opinion no

1823.7 --> 1829.039
infighting

1825.679 --> 1832.039
but yeah it's become kind of egregious

1829.039 --> 1835.1
or it has been for a while it just never

1832.039 --> 1839.299
really evolved into something better and

1835.1 --> 1843.3799999999999
so tackling that entire front

1839.299 --> 1844.76
yeah it's the new grounds for us for the

1843.38 --> 1848.419
Flat Earth debates

1844.76 --> 1851.48
and I'm I'm loving it I mean yeah get

1848.419 --> 1853.5200000000002
those those idiots

1851.48 --> 1856.34
those Pretender clowns that think

1853.52 --> 1858.74
they're I mean those figures yesterday

1856.34 --> 1861.4399999999998
supposedly being flat earthers in that

1858.74 --> 1863.96
debate that Nathan reviewed

1861.44 --> 1867.3990000000001
they were more concerned about getting

1863.96 --> 1868.96
their special boy victim status

1867.399 --> 1870.58
we're

1868.96 --> 1875.059
persecuted

1870.58 --> 1876.799
and like no refuting of any actual

1875.059 --> 1880.36
technicals

1876.799 --> 1880.36
it was all so lame

1889.279 --> 1894.919
no I have not played back the theme

1893.0 --> 1897.26
music

1894.919 --> 1899.919
to hear what it sounds like it's

1897.26 --> 1899.919
ridiculous

1901.88 --> 1906.94
I mean why would I even do that what's

1904.52 --> 1906.94
the point

1907.35 --> 1914.4399999999998
[Music]

1910.64 --> 1914.44
there's no secret message in there

1917.72 --> 1922.239
foreign

1919.15 --> 1922.239
[Music]

1933.58 --> 1938.539
no thank you Satan

1936.799 --> 1942.22
yes we can

1938.539 --> 1942.22
thank you Satan

1954.99 --> 1961.86
[Music]

1959.419 --> 1966.2900000000002
thank you

1961.86 --> 1966.29
[Music]

1966.82 --> 1972.3799999999999
but no there's no uh there's no vocals

1970.159 --> 1974.18
or text in the intro song so whatever

1972.38 --> 1978.6190000000001
man uh

1974.18 --> 1978.6190000000001
[Music]

1988.7 --> 1993.44
but anyway yeah good point flutter Sage

1992.179 --> 1998.8400000000001
well

1993.44 --> 2000.94
what this is like really using my deep

1998.84 --> 2002.799
dive skills you could say I think that

2000.94 --> 2005.019
those people

2002.799 --> 2007.6589999999999
I think that in a way they were actually

2005.019 --> 2009.6
flat earthers I think that they were

2007.659 --> 2011.22
like

2009.6 --> 2016.0
pretty

2011.22 --> 2019.179
integrated with society and then

2016.0 --> 2022.419
like it's trendy to them

2019.179 --> 2024.7
they think that flat what they feel like

2022.419 --> 2026.7990000000002
is that they are people that are flat

2024.7 --> 2030.72
earthers because they think it makes

2026.799 --> 2030.72
them special it's all the rage

2032.5 --> 2037.08
they seemed a little bit like well

2038.32 --> 2044.519
oh God I don't even did

2041.98 --> 2047.26
they seemed a little dewy

2044.519 --> 2050.379
I mean with all the oh

2047.26 --> 2053.639
um poor me oh no

2050.379 --> 2056.919
they trying to hurt me

2053.639 --> 2059.26
they're not literally like that but you

2056.919 --> 2061.48
you kind of probably know what I mean it

2059.26 --> 2064.179
felt a little dewy that doesn't mean

2061.48 --> 2065.679
that it's all an act and fake it just

2064.179 --> 2068.26
means that

2065.679 --> 2069.879
they seem just like oh yeah we're Flat

2068.26 --> 2072.2200000000003
Earth there's and oh we're so special

2069.879 --> 2076.899
they were just being

2072.22 --> 2079.1789999999996
like that not really focused

2076.899 --> 2082.0
flat earthers that were like really are

2079.179 --> 2084.339
into the technicals and all that

2082.0 --> 2088.179
didn't sound like that at all

2084.339 --> 2091.54
they did not sound even well researched

2088.179 --> 2094.96
even for years ago it was just like

2091.54 --> 2098.2599999999998
messy and trendy and and it seemed just

2094.96 --> 2101.44
like they were trendy flat earthers

2098.26 --> 2104.32
which are complete Duds and uninformed

2101.44 --> 2107.02
and just oh we're so special we want our

2104.32 --> 2110.079
special exemption status or religious

2107.02 --> 2111.7599999999998
status or victim status some kind of a

2110.079 --> 2115.7200000000003
status

2111.76 --> 2120.6600000000003
and that's what really stood out to me

2115.72 --> 2120.66
with yesterday's uh video analysis

2126.64 --> 2129.1189999999997
right

2129.16 --> 2134.68
so I do actually think that they wear

2131.32 --> 2137.079
flat earthers but well trendy flat

2134.68 --> 2140.64
earthers which is a sub-category of

2137.079 --> 2140.6400000000003
numpty flat earther basically

2143.46 --> 2148.38
they're into it because they think it's

2145.66 --> 2148.3799999999997
all trendy

2148.98 --> 2152.289
[Music]

2155.079 --> 2159.46
thank you

2157.24 --> 2162.16
I mean you could compare it to like oh

2159.46 --> 2165.28
wow this new church just opened up and

2162.16 --> 2166.7799999999997
it's totally new it's a new way and man

2165.28 --> 2171.8390000000004
I'm going to be part of that because

2166.78 --> 2171.8390000000004
it's just sounds so hip and [ __ ]

2172.38 --> 2177.3
that's kind of the feel it gave me so

2180.119 --> 2186.94
any feedback on that

2184.06 --> 2189.119
people just drop off a few words here

2186.94 --> 2192.099
and then like run away for 10 minutes

2189.119 --> 2193.96
desperately hoping I won't try to pull

2192.099 --> 2196.599
them back to the chat

2193.96 --> 2199.599
I mean God forbid we actually have a

2196.599 --> 2202.44
back and forth about something here

2199.599 --> 2202.44
uh

2202.48 --> 2206.87
anyway

2203.37 --> 2206.87
[Music]

2208.119 --> 2212.8
you did more as entertainment and

2209.98 --> 2215.56
educate well that's what like the

2212.8 --> 2218.82
the program maker seemed to have that

2215.56 --> 2218.82
attitude flatter Sage

2225.04 --> 2230.5
but yeah these supposed they seem just

2227.8 --> 2232.6600000000003
like oh we're we're so groundbreaking

2230.5 --> 2234.4
we're so trendy

2232.66 --> 2236.3199999999997
[Music]

2234.4 --> 2237.46
we're the Flat Earth there's we're

2236.32 --> 2240.04
special

2237.46 --> 2242.5
we can see through the lies of the

2240.04 --> 2244.96
government but you can barely even

2242.5 --> 2246.88
describe in a way that'll actually make

2244.96 --> 2249.579
sense to people in order for them to

2246.88 --> 2253.26
change their point of view yeah

2249.579 --> 2253.26
not very talented

2266.22 --> 2271.4199999999996
anti-flat earthers make made up

2268.9 --> 2273.599
characters where they can't get anyone

2271.42 --> 2273.599
else

2278.14 --> 2285.0
Maybe

2280.839 --> 2285.0
it didn't seem like it though

2286.599 --> 2292.119
I mean they did actually ask some good

2289.66 --> 2293.859
questions but then just didn't have the

2292.119 --> 2296.859
discipline to follow up on those

2293.859 --> 2298.7799999999997
questions with consequences right but

2296.859 --> 2300.4
they didn't seem like anti-flat Earth or

2298.78 --> 2302.6800000000003
an anti-flat earther that would act like

2300.4 --> 2306.46
a flat Earth they would never do that

2302.68 --> 2308.74
they would never accidentally take that

2306.46 --> 2310.359
lid off the jar never

2308.74 --> 2313.24
you know that

2310.359 --> 2316.2999999999997
because they're obsessed with such

2313.24 --> 2318.3999999999996
things even as they're acting so

2665.44 --> 2674.04
there is no measured distance to the Sun

2674.74 --> 2680.02
you can have vacuum

2680.02 --> 2684.119
gas pressure without a container

2686.46 --> 2693.339
gravity is a concept and people have

2690.7 --> 2695.5
lost track of what it actually is so

2693.339 --> 2698.68
nobody really knows because it doesn't

2695.5 --> 2701.22
exist it's conception

2698.68 --> 2701.22
huh

2701.26 --> 2707.3190000000004
relative density is how we stay on Earth

2703.98 --> 2710.56
also containment a very important factor

2707.319 --> 2713.38
of how to stay on Earth well the realm

2710.56 --> 2715.9
Earth being a contained system is very

2713.38 --> 2717.88
helpful to that detail

2715.9 --> 2720.78
yeah that's how we stay on Earth by

2717.88 --> 2720.78
being contained

2722.02 --> 2727.3
you cannot fly well

2724.599 --> 2730.599
depends on how you define as flying but

2727.3 --> 2733.319
I bet that we would be surrounding

2730.599 --> 2737.319
ourselves with some kind of

2733.319 --> 2741.2799999999997
gas that would be more dense than our

2737.319 --> 2743.74
averaged out body masses then yeah then

2741.28 --> 2746.2000000000003
we could fly

2743.74 --> 2750.8799999999997
because the only thing that matters as

2746.2 --> 2752.6189999999997
to our vertical displacement is relative

2750.88 --> 2756.4
density

2752.619 --> 2758.319
relative density this equilibrium Force

2756.4 --> 2762.339
to be more precise

2758.319 --> 2763.599
which is purely circumstantial based

2762.339 --> 2765.819
on

2763.599 --> 2768.9
the density of the medium versus the

2765.819 --> 2768.9
density of the object

2769.599 --> 2778.6200000000003
since well we are denser than air yeah

2774.819 --> 2781.889
that's how we then stay on the ground

[Music]

2786.63 --> 2789.849
[Music]

2795.04 --> 2802.359
how density works well there has been a

2799.359 --> 2804.52
sort of little coup attempt within the

2802.359 --> 2808.54
physics community and they've designated

2804.52 --> 2810.7
or redesignated relative density as

2808.54 --> 2815.02
specific gravity

2810.7 --> 2819.06
which actually lays it out how it works

2815.02 --> 2819.06
and that there is no downward bias

2819.4 --> 2825.4
that there's just an upward and a

2822.04 --> 2828.579
downward displacement based

2825.4 --> 2829.96
on the density relation of the object

2828.579 --> 2833.1800000000003
with the median

2829.96 --> 2836.41
the differential between them

2833.18 --> 2836.41
[Music]

2838.96 --> 2844.78
white things go up heavy things go down

2842.5 --> 2846.099
that that's a colloquial way of saying

2844.78 --> 2848.579
it right

2846.099 --> 2851.38
but yeah as long as you have

2848.579 --> 2852.4
uncontained gases that are out in the

2851.38 --> 2856.599
open

2852.4 --> 2859.06
not like stuck in a balloon then well

2856.599 --> 2860.44
they are going to spread out in all

2859.06 --> 2862.72
directions

2860.44 --> 2865.3
even if they're lighter than the average

2862.72 --> 2867.16
Arab like a helium it's still going to

2865.3 --> 2868.7200000000003
spread in all directions but it might

2867.16 --> 2872.7999999999997
have a slight

2868.72 --> 2875.68
upward bias as it spreads around

2872.8 --> 2879.579
just like sulfur hexafluoride the

2875.68 --> 2882.7599999999998
heavier gas when released

2879.579 --> 2886.1800000000003
will spread out in all directions with a

2882.76 --> 2889.42
slot slide downward bias because it is

2886.18 --> 2892.18
denser while it's still unmixed because

2889.42 --> 2895.54
yeah it mixes up in the inhomogeneous

2892.18 --> 2897.4199999999996
mesh of the air eventually and it will

2895.54 --> 2900.099
spread around in all directions

2897.42 --> 2901.96
uniformly with a slide downward bias

2900.099 --> 2904.1800000000003
because it's denser than the average air

2901.96 --> 2906.88
for as long as it's not mixed in

2904.18 --> 2909.94
same goes for helium up with the upward

2906.88 --> 2912.4
it will also eventually mix in

2909.94 --> 2915.16
as long as it isn't it will on average

2912.4 --> 2916.9
be less dense than the air and thus as

2915.16 --> 2919.72
it's spreading in all directions it will

2916.9 --> 2922.1800000000003
have a slight upward bias in its

2919.72 --> 2925.02
spreading out pattern

2922.18 --> 2925.02

2958.96 --> 2961.44

2977.22 --> 2985.66

well by riding the pressure local air

2985.66 --> 2989.819
pressure differential through movement

2997.54 --> 3001.319
I mean there's such a thing as air

2999.28 --> 3003.96
friction and what airplanes you could

3001.319 --> 3007.339
consider airplanes to be lifting due to

3003.96 --> 3007.339

[Music]

3026.18 --> 3032.16
it's possible to overcome relative

3028.98 --> 3033.96
density well relative density is just a

3032.16 --> 3035.819
force

3033.96 --> 3037.98
right it's just

3035.819 --> 3041.88
something that naturally happens without

3037.98 --> 3047.72
any influences but yeah you can move

3041.88 --> 3047.7200000000003
and movement does have another influence

3047.94 --> 3053.52
what causes the force well the relative

3050.46 --> 3054.48
density this equilibrium causes the

3053.52 --> 3056.4
force

3054.48 --> 3059.339
it is the force

3056.4 --> 3061.98
and it just happens it always happens

3059.339 --> 3064.74
every time it's scientifically valid

3061.98 --> 3066.839
could even be classified under natural

3064.74 --> 3070.5589999999997
law

3066.839 --> 3074.22
although that would require just more

3070.559 --> 3075.7200000000003
more development more bad more peer

3074.22 --> 3078.3799999999997
review ironically

3075.72 --> 3081.48
but

3078.38 --> 3084.54
it is basically scientifically proven

3081.48 --> 3086.94
through demonstration it always works

3084.54 --> 3089.339
there's no exception no matter what you

3086.94 --> 3091.8
do there will never be an exception to

3089.339 --> 3095.22
the influences of relative density

3091.8 --> 3098.6400000000003
it's always there cannot be taken away

3095.22 --> 3100.5589999999997
but other forces can be

3098.64 --> 3104.1189999999997
added

3100.559 --> 3104.119
and then they will combine

3104.16 --> 3111.0589999999997
right so if you accelerate in a car

3108.18 --> 3113.22
that is closed off with its own separate

3111.059 --> 3116.1800000000003
air compartment in it

3113.22 --> 3119.0989999999997
then if you accelerated a constant

3116.18 --> 3122.3999999999996
accelerating rate faster faster

3119.099 --> 3126.059
during that whole time you will have an

3122.4 --> 3128.819
apparent axial shift of the relative

3126.059 --> 3130.92
density distribution but it's apparent

3128.819 --> 3135.0
because what basically happening is that

3130.92 --> 3137.9
relative density has a certain axis and

3135.0 --> 3141.18
then another Force

3137.9 --> 3145.14
horizontal acceleration is added on top

3141.18 --> 3149.54
of that and so they then even out and

3145.14 --> 3149.54
form a new diagonal axis together

3153.96 --> 3156.96

3158.18 --> 3167.16

3163.38 --> 3170.6400000000003

3167.16 --> 3173.7599999999998
nothing nothing can stop it nothing can

3170.64 --> 3176.64
stop relative density from working the

3173.76 --> 3178.7400000000002
way it does but you can add other forces

3176.64 --> 3180.66
and other stuff to it

3178.74 --> 3183.24
thank you

3180.66 --> 3186.0
right

3183.24 --> 3188.12

3206.46 --> 3211.7400000000002

3208.28 --> 3214.26
no nobody had that theory

3211.74 --> 3216.5989999999997
nobody

3214.26 --> 3219.059
except for Einstein

3216.599 --> 3221.599
he's the one that brought that up

3219.059 --> 3223.8590000000004
and it's interesting because

3221.599 --> 3227.94
Einstein's conception of the earth

3223.859 --> 3230.5789999999997
accelerating up forever even though very

3227.94 --> 3233.4
ridiculous to be taken literal

3230.579 --> 3235.26
as a mathematical

3233.4 --> 3239.119
setting

3235.26 --> 3239.119
it is actually sensible

3239.339 --> 3246.14
I mean you could think of the earth as

3242.64 --> 3251.04
being accelerating up forever it isn't

3246.14 --> 3253.98
but yeah that would definitely explain

3251.04 --> 3256.74
demonstrably

3253.98 --> 3259.859
the axis of the relative density

3256.74 --> 3261.72
alignment and how you add another force

3259.859 --> 3263.52
and then change the axis well the axis

3261.72 --> 3266.9399999999996
is there naturally in a stationary

3263.52 --> 3268.859
setting if you then mathematically

3266.94 --> 3271.14
conclude that the entire Earth is

3268.859 --> 3273.18
accelerating up causing the relative

3271.14 --> 3276.2599999999998
density

3273.18 --> 3278.94
axis then that makes sense

3276.26 --> 3280.559
mathematically because practically of

3278.94 --> 3282.78
course it does and the Earth isn't

3280.559 --> 3285.599
freaking accelerating up where the hell

3282.78 --> 3288.78
would it be accelerating up into there's

3285.599 --> 3292.6800000000003
nothing there and it's stationary

3288.78 --> 3295.26
like it's just nothing about it could

3292.68 --> 3297.4199999999996
really literally be like that that would

3295.26 --> 3300.0
be

3297.42 --> 3303.1800000000003
I mean

3300.0 --> 3305.04
that would like then it would just be a

3303.18 --> 3306.72
freaking simulation that nothing is real

3305.04 --> 3309.3
then it's all a simulation because

3306.72 --> 3310.98
that's how you would do it in a

3309.3 --> 3313.079

3310.98 --> 3315.9
right you want gravity you just say oh

3313.079 --> 3317.94
yeah the entire thing oh we have physics

3489.96 --> 3495.28

3496.619 --> 3499.88
I mean come on

3512.72 --> 3519.359
yes Nemo

3515.579 --> 3523.98
I already said yes deaths dance stuff

3519.359 --> 3525.72
goes down less dense stuff goes up

3523.98 --> 3529.079
correct

3525.72 --> 3533.04
it's all about the density relation

3529.079 --> 3535.2200000000003
between the object and the medium it is

3533.04 --> 3535.22
in

3539.78 --> 3545.42
only downward

3542.04 --> 3545.42
okay dude

3546.059 --> 3553.5
I mean why don't humans have wings dude

3551.76 --> 3555.9
I mean that's a reasonable question

3553.5 --> 3558.72
right I mean if we'd have wings then we

3555.9 --> 3559.92
could fly so why don't we have wings

3558.72 --> 3562.819
Nemo

3559.92 --> 3562.819

3601.92 --> 3606.319
hey how are you doing man it's been ages

3612.96 --> 3618.78
if density Falls to density yeah but it

3616.02 --> 3621.78
doesn't do that

3618.78 --> 3624.5400000000004
it doesn't fall to anything

3621.78 --> 3627.8390000000004
if it's denser it goes down if it's less

3624.54 --> 3631.92
dense it goes up that is all it doesn't

3627.839 --> 3633.24
move towards anything specific to a

3631.92 --> 3638.0

3633.24 --> 3638.0

this [ __ ] dude

3668.339 --> 3676.44
I mean you do realize that your head is

3672.059 --> 3681.5
on your shoulders and your ass is below

3676.44 --> 3681.5
your belly you do know that right

3687.74 --> 3693.839
does even space exist no

3691.079 --> 3695.94
and it doesn't exist in any concept it

3693.839 --> 3699.319
cannot exist it can only exist in our

3695.94 --> 3704.76

3699.319 --> 3707.16
insurmountable natural law violation

3704.76 --> 3710.2200000000003

3707.16 --> 3713.2799999999997

3710.22 --> 3716.0589999999997
understand that it cannot even be

foreign

3720.26 --> 3725.2200000000003
sure that's very easy but as soon as you

3723.059 --> 3728.7000000000003
want to actually make it physics

3725.22 --> 3731.8799999999997
compliant then you're immediately

3728.7 --> 3734.64
done because you can't because they

3731.88 --> 3738.92
cannot simulate

3734.64 --> 3738.92
how gas pressure would even work

3739.2 --> 3744.48
in this supposed glow cosmology because

3741.839 --> 3746.04
they deny the second law of

3744.48 --> 3749.119
thermodynamics

3746.04 --> 3753.74
gas pressure expands in all directions

3749.119 --> 3753.7400000000002
to fill the available volume

3754.5 --> 3758.43
yeah and then

3756.48 --> 3759.98
yeah sure gradient might form

3758.43 --> 3763.44
[Music]

3759.98 --> 3766.7400000000002
afterward after that volume of the

container has been met

3766.74 --> 3771.5989999999997
yeah

3768.54 --> 3774.18
because if it doesn't meet it

3771.599 --> 3775.92
that container wall then there's not a

3774.18 --> 3778.2799999999997
gradient that's going to form It's Just

3775.92 --> 3780.5
Gonna Keep On blasting in all directions

until it

3780.5 --> 3785.4
binds the container wall

3783.059 --> 3789.619
which in this case it never will because

3785.4 --> 3793.28
Outer Space Universe volume is

3789.619 --> 3793.28
theoretically infinite

foreign

3819.15 --> 3823.4
[Music]

3824.46 --> 3830.52
why is there a stable pressure gradient

3826.5 --> 3834.359
well first off because there is

3830.52 --> 3838.319
a containment situation that will allow

3834.359 --> 3840.38
the gradient to form that's first off

3838.319 --> 3840.38
um

3842.579 --> 3845.579
second

3844.2 --> 3849.5989999999997
I don't

3845.579 --> 3851.2200000000003
fully with absolute certainty no

3849.599 --> 3855.3590000000004
but

3851.22 --> 3857.8799999999997
I've surmised to figure it out

3855.359 --> 3859.74
that there's a great likelihood

3857.88 --> 3862.6800000000003
that the gradient that we experience

3859.74 --> 3867.0589999999997
here in this realm is caused

3862.68 --> 3869.04
by very distinct temperature influences

3867.059 --> 3872.3390000000004
mainly Heat

3869.04 --> 3874.68
the ground from inside the earth and on

3872.339 --> 3875.7
the Earth's surface by being heated by

3874.68 --> 3878.7
sunlight

3875.7 --> 3881.7599999999998
and way up there

3878.7 --> 3884.52
through a cold element like where

3881.76 --> 3887.3390000000004
there's actual coals there

3884.52 --> 3889.559
that doesn't just slowly heat up over

3887.339 --> 3892.5
the ages it's just cold that it's always

3889.559 --> 3895.3390000000004
cold there

3892.5 --> 3898.68
and it well if you actually take a

3895.339 --> 3902.339
container like an aquarium

3898.68 --> 3904.5
and you put a heating element on one

3902.339 --> 3906.599
side of the aquarium and a cooling

3904.5 --> 3910.2
element on the other side

3906.599 --> 3913.319
you'll find measurably that there will

3910.2 --> 3917.1189999999997
be a gas pressure gradient forming

3913.319 --> 3917.119
within that tanker

3917.16 --> 3921.72
so that is

3918.839 --> 3925.0789999999997
well it's the only lead

3921.72 --> 3927.9599999999996
that would start to explain

3925.079 --> 3930.5
why there is a gradient within our

temperature influence

it means that

the space you're standing in

you wouldn't be able to get a euclidean

4682.46 --> 4686.4800000000005
it will beat the scale yeah but then you

4684.38 --> 4689.36
zoom out and then you put it all

with just that with like oh so you're

5362.44 --> 5367.0599999999995
talking about a flat map so that proves

5364.9 --> 5368.679
then that the Earth is flat according to

5367.06 --> 5370.96
you Flat Earth and that was what he was

is basically treating you like you were

5376.84 --> 5382.12
a dumb newbie flat earther

5379.0 --> 5383.679
like those people that Nathan reviewed

5382.12 --> 5386.44
yesterday

5383.679 --> 5388.719
that is what he thought you were you

5386.44 --> 5391.0599999999995
thought they even could easily straw man

5388.719 --> 5394.86

5408.219 --> 5414.159

5410.86 --> 5417.239
silverware edible that actually exists

not that I'm interested in that or

5421.9 --> 5426.759999999999

5425.199 --> 5431.699

5460.239 --> 5466.0
but the whole point about the map has

5463.54 --> 5470.139
nothing to do with oh it is flat biggest

5466.0 --> 5471.659
flat yeah yeah no no no no you see the

5470.139 --> 5474.84
map

5471.659 --> 5478.239
not being the scale

5474.84 --> 5480.46
it only really it I mean it doesn't

5478.239 --> 5482.739
imply all that much it's it's there's

5480.46 --> 5486.159
not even that many consequence it's just

5482.739 --> 5490.299999999999
one of the consequences is that well the

5486.159 --> 5494.099999999999
Earth is definitely not literally a ball

5490.3 --> 5496.84
okay that's like the conclusion

5494.1 --> 5498.159000000001
exclusively that you could get out of it

5496.84 --> 5502.12
not

5498.159 --> 5505.96
oh it has to be flat or you can come to

5502.12 --> 5508.239
that conclusion by other in other ways

5505.96 --> 5510.34
that it's not too difficult to figure

5508.239 --> 5513.0599999999995
out the Earth is flap but that doesn't

5510.34 --> 5513.06
mean that

5513.52 --> 5520.42
it's just like oh yeah it's the disc no

5516.76 --> 5522.04
no it isn't yes because that thing is

5520.42 --> 5524.62
not the scale either

5522.04 --> 5526.48
we don't have any two scale Maps no

5524.62 --> 5528.099999999999
matter the projection yeah do you

5526.48 --> 5533.5
understand that all these different

5528.1 --> 5537.76
projections oh the disc and the cube and

5533.5 --> 5539.639
and the ball and all guess what none of

5537.76 --> 5544.02
these Maps

5539.639 --> 5544.02
zero are to scale

5545.44 --> 5551.32
that doesn't automatically mean the

5547.78 --> 5554.62
Earth is flat it just means it is

5551.32 --> 5557.259999999999
definitely not that glow projection

5554.62 --> 5560.5
or that disc projection

5557.26 --> 5561.83
because they're not the scale

5585.219 --> 5590.679

5587.139 --> 5592.6

5590.679 --> 5594.219
stupid

5592.6 --> 5597.46
they will not

5594.219 --> 5601.26
like they'll lose track

5597.46 --> 5601.26

if you can prevent your subjects from

5605.04 --> 5612.3
becoming the wiser

5607.48 --> 5612.299999999999
then you retain mind control

5618.219 --> 5624.58
also simply because well the actual to

5621.52 --> 5628.360000000001
Scale map if if it exists it might not

5624.58 --> 5630.699
be possible to actually have it

5628.36 --> 5632.86

5630.699 --> 5635.739
too surreal and that it's been deemed

5632.86 --> 5638.62
like yeah this thing definitely people

5635.739 --> 5641.28
cannot handle this

5638.62 --> 5644.139
it might be to a degree that lets you

5641.28 --> 5646.179
secretly like some Jesuit came by it's

5644.139 --> 5648.159000000001

I'm going to show you the real thing now

5649.9 --> 5652.48

5651.58 --> 5653.92
be like

5652.48 --> 5655.959999999999
what

5653.92 --> 5659.02

5655.96 --> 5660.34
yeah yeah well [ __ ] then yeah yeah of

course you're not gonna show this that

5660.34 --> 5664.360000000001
this like people would go insane if they

5662.62 --> 5668.08
saw this was it

5664.36 --> 5671.98
right that might be the case it might be

5668.08 --> 5674.88
that it might simply be too crazy for

5671.98 --> 5674.879999999999
people to handle

5676.3 --> 5682.6
right I mean if it's if there's a loop

5679.06 --> 5685.120000000001
involved that's already freaking weird

5682.6 --> 5689.56
most people can't even you can't even

5685.12 --> 5692.46
explain to them what that means okay a

5689.56 --> 5692.46
loop in a system

5692.739 --> 5698.919999999999
so let alone telling them like oh yeah

5695.38 --> 5700.36
and you are in that Loop right now in

5698.92 --> 5702.9400000000005
this realm

5700.36 --> 5705.4
the like you think most people can just

5702.94 --> 5708.94
handle that just like oh yeah sure

5705.4 --> 5710.739
why not we're in a loop okay

5708.94 --> 5712.299999999999
well they might even have that attitude

5710.739 --> 5713.98
but does that mean that they actually

5712.3 --> 5716.8
understand it

5713.98 --> 5718.599999999999
I highly doubt it

5716.8 --> 5721.42
so

5718.6 --> 5723.9400000000005
that might be the reason why there's no

5721.42 --> 5725.38
to Scale map it's because people can't

5723.94 --> 5728.138999999999
handle the truth

5725.38 --> 5730.06
or have been size up as in not being

5728.139 --> 5732.28
able to handle the truth or

5730.06 --> 5735.34
alternatively

5732.28 --> 5738.46
it's a very specific key part of

5735.34 --> 5741.76
knowledge that from a very high top-down

5738.46 --> 5743.44
situation has not been green lighted to

5741.76 --> 5745.780000000001
be spread to the masses

5743.44 --> 5747.699
because it would like change key

5745.78 --> 5749.5
components in the mind control systems

5747.699 --> 5750.58
that have been built up for hundreds of

5749.5 --> 5753.63

5750.58 --> 5762.409
could be that too

[Music]

5762.82 --> 5767.94
which projection is the scale closest to

reality I don't know

5768.1 --> 5770.820000000001
don't know

5774.82 --> 5781.44
well there is one map I think that is

5778.08 --> 5781.44
pretty close

5784.239 --> 5789.78
find it

5785.739 --> 5789.78
keep forgetting the name of it though

5807.94 --> 5812.259999999999
I think yeah and it's still not the

5809.92 --> 5814.96
scale though just for the record

5812.26 --> 5818.4400000000005
I like to think that it is more to scale

5814.96 --> 5823.0
and also it was apparently made

5818.44 --> 5825.759999999999
specifically to be more to scale because

5823.0 --> 5828.46
there have been much worse scaling

5825.76 --> 5832.2390000000005
issues historically with the maps

5828.46 --> 5835.42
remember like the old age map

5832.239 --> 5836.919999999999
where Africa would be like the same size

5835.42 --> 5841.12
as Europe

5836.92 --> 5843.52
right so scaling issues have been around

5841.12 --> 5845.679
in maps for a while

5843.52 --> 5849.120000000001
really they have

5845.679 --> 5849.12
anyway this is uh

5850.06 --> 5856.7390000000005
the map that is probably the closest to

5853.96 --> 5856.7390000000005
being to scale

5863.699 --> 5867.4

5933.76 --> 5939.360000000001
but it is the projection this is what

5936.159 --> 5939.36
the projection is like though

5940.48 --> 5948.28
and this one is actually more accurately

5943.3 --> 5948.28
to scale than any of its counterparts

5954.6 --> 5960.06
equally distorted everywhere yeah that's

5956.98 --> 5960.0599999999995
one way you could say it

5960.69 --> 5963.849999999999
[Music]

5966.76 --> 5971.320000000001
you just everything oh well thank you

5969.219 --> 5974.139
for your [ __ ] little Brilliance eh

5971.32 --> 5976.12
you asked for it then I gave it to you I

5974.139 --> 5979.179
disclaimed it and now oh it's just only

5976.12 --> 5982.179
this yeah yeah yeah Mr numpty yeah

5979.179 --> 5986.02
you're not on top of the situation

5982.179 --> 5989.82
don't try to act like you are

5986.02 --> 5992.679
okay gave you what you asked for

5989.82 --> 5995.799999999999
disclaimed it for what it is

5992.679 --> 5998.4
that doesn't make you special

5995.8 --> 5998.400000000001
okay

6000.49 --> 6014.179
[Music]

6010.32 --> 6014.179
looked at these projections

6017.58 --> 6020.58
foreign

6033.27 --> 6036.319
[Music]

6036.9 --> 6040.759999999999
it's just another projection again

6046.08 --> 6050.639
and yeah

6047.94 --> 6053.5199999999995
I mean it should be blatantly obvious

6050.639 --> 6054.54
that Australia is completely weird in

6053.52 --> 6058.219
that one

6054.54 --> 6058.219
doesn't make any freaking sense

6063.9 --> 6068.699
it's weird it's a it's a really weird

6066.84 --> 6072.06
map

6068.699 --> 6075.419999999999
how is Antarctica even like

6072.06 --> 6078.54
on the same latitude as Australia

6075.42 --> 6082.1
doesn't make any freaking sense

6078.54 --> 6082.1
but anyway thanks for the link

6083.159 --> 6088.44
hey dank

6086.04 --> 6090.8
yeah you are late I was gonna round out

6088.44 --> 6090.799999999999
the show

6091.98 --> 6095.599999999999
I can't believe it went so fast

6096.44 --> 6100.699
I guess it was entertaining

6102.29 --> 6109.0289999999995
[Music]

6111.02 --> 6117.659000000001
my data I don't have data I literally

6114.9 --> 6118.739
looked it up and demonstrated it on my

6117.659 --> 6121.739
show

6118.739 --> 6124.44
by sliding over the map that you

6121.739 --> 6125.28
literally see the scale bar going up and

6124.44 --> 6127.86
down

6125.28 --> 6129.84
that's what I demonstrated that is my

6127.86 --> 6133.259999999999
data

6129.84 --> 6136.92
I haven't written a book about this

6133.26 --> 6138.900000000001
I just demonstrated that it's there that

6136.92 --> 6141.659
is all I've demonstrated over time and

6138.9 --> 6143.879999999999
demonstrated it like six years ago

6141.659 --> 6146.9
and then I demonstrated it

6143.88 --> 6146.900000000001
a month ago

6147.239 --> 6152.159
it's not changed

6149.52 --> 6155.179
not much anyway still scaling issues

6152.159 --> 6155.179
it's still right there

6156.139 --> 6159.619
okay right back

6177.739 --> 6183.379999999999
no you don't Nemo you dumbass

6185.719 --> 6193.219
freaking mountains is not the reason why

6189.48 --> 6193.218999999999
your globe map isn't working

6202.08 --> 6205.86
okay Mark Beck what a ridiculous

6204.719 --> 6208.08
statement

6205.86 --> 6209.099999999999
you can already use the map to navigate

6208.08 --> 6212.4
with

6209.1 --> 6215.400000000001
it's all based on Celestial navigation

6212.4 --> 6218.699
and the map doesn't have to beat the

6215.4 --> 6221.4
scale in order to find your way with it

6218.699 --> 6224.36
using Celestial navigation

6221.4 --> 6228.659
yeah this is not about the navigation

6224.36 --> 6231.659
it's about what is euclidean physical

6228.659 --> 6231.659
reality

6231.9 --> 6238.44
well the maps they show us are not a

6235.86 --> 6242.46
accurate representation of the terrain

6238.44 --> 6243.239
because it's not to scale that was the

6242.46 --> 6245.52
point

6243.239 --> 6248.599999999999
that was pretty much the only point

6245.52 --> 6248.6
about it

6249.04 --> 6252.25
[Music]

6254.57 --> 6259.389999999999
[Music]

6263.31 --> 6272.0
[Music]

6266.84 --> 6272.0
how much does it matter

6275.34 --> 6280.679
but yeah I think that

6278.04 --> 6285.6
I think like 30

6280.679 --> 6289.11
to 40 percent roughly in scale chain

6285.6 --> 6290.6990000000005
like you really see that bar sliding

6289.11 --> 6292.739
[Music]

6290.699 --> 6295.678999999999
so yeah

6292.739 --> 6298.5
it's not like oh there's like there's

6295.679 --> 6302.6990000000005
two percent off no no no no

6298.5 --> 6308.52
no no no the big scaling issues big

6302.699 --> 6313.099999999999
not just like two percent no like think

6308.52 --> 6313.1
offsets of like 30 40 percent

6314.28 --> 6320.179
big visually standing out scale

6317.639 --> 6320.179
differences

6324.94 --> 6331.1089999999995
[Music]

6331.56 --> 6337.4400000000005
yeah it does Misty it does change

6334.92 --> 6338.58
massively did you not see me describing

6337.44 --> 6341.599999999999
it to you

6338.58 --> 6347.28
yeah scale bar

6341.6 --> 6349.8
right here hey here yeah that's the

6347.28 --> 6352.38
scale bar that's how much it changes

6349.8 --> 6355.02
yeah that's a lot

6352.38 --> 6357.32
so you can stop trying to downplay this

6355.02 --> 6357.320000000001
now

6359.88 --> 6372.54
they're there they're visually striking

6363.61 --> 6374.46
[Music]

6372.54 --> 6375.42
all right anyway I'm gonna round out the

6374.46 --> 6377.88
show

6375.42 --> 6379.619
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6377.88 --> 6382.139
