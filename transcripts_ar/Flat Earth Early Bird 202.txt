7.45 --> 42.45
[Music]

38.51 --> 45.839999999999996
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.45 --> 49.02
early-bird number 202 202

45.84 --> 50.879000000000005
I'm your host Arwen and before I start

49.02 --> 54.36
to show please don't forget to share it

50.879 --> 55.83
on any platform you deem fit and also if

54.36 --> 57.57
you haven't already please subscribe to

55.83 --> 59.25
my channel and hit the bell notification

57.57 --> 62.1
so you know when I'm going live which is

59.25 --> 65.03
normally 2:00 p.m. after damn time today

62.1 --> 71.09
I'm just a tiny bit later arrived late

65.03 --> 75.93
because the weather today is it's hot

71.09 --> 79.55000000000001
it's like myths oh my god just grabbing

75.93 --> 83.22000000000001
the webcam it is like everything is hot

79.55 --> 85.17
pewter is hot electronics are hot it

83.22 --> 90.3
feels like a very heavy Midsummer's day

85.17 --> 92.67
and they're still continually

90.3 --> 94.38
cam trailing the [ __ ] out of the place

92.67 --> 99.03
like they haven't even stopped during

94.38 --> 100.94999999999999
the night and yeah there is a gray haze

99.03 --> 102.75
everywhere but it just doesn't really

100.95 --> 106.14
matter because it's just freakin hot

102.75 --> 110.58
like really really hot and the wind is

106.14 --> 115.74
hot as well well hot by Dutch standards

110.58 --> 118.92
anyway God so yeah go out there it was

115.74 --> 124.38
like nice but it does really slowly down

118.92 --> 126.36
I don't even want to think of what's

124.38 --> 132.98
hanging in the air basically now at this

126.36 --> 137.06
point so yeah today I got Tamara coffee

132.98 --> 140.459
very fresh and an apple again yeah

137.06 --> 143.01
especially with this heat you got and I

140.459 --> 145.26
got some water that has been in the in

143.01 --> 148.95999999999998
the cooler for two hours old

145.26 --> 157.48
oh what a luxury

148.96 --> 158.29000000000002
ah yeah that kind of thing becomes a

157.48 --> 165.19
necessity

158.29 --> 169.75
what is this hot so let's see who's in

165.19 --> 174.73
jet you can probably hear that I'm still

169.75 --> 176.77
a bit cold ish although yeah

174.73 --> 184.75
it mostly seems to be like after

176.77 --> 187.09
symptoms not sneezing a lot okay Steve

184.75 --> 188.8
righteous force drunken bullet for one

187.09 --> 195.85
one stopping traffic in my rest I had

188.8 --> 200.52
Daniel Valerio Nathan Oakley 90 80s with

195.85 --> 204.69
cloud James Mason hm

200.52 --> 210.42000000000002
yeah good to see you all perish Mike

204.69 --> 210.42
good morning ah Daniel

216.1 --> 226.31
mm-hmm don't don't be a dick

222.74 --> 229.60000000000002
Daniel it's not true you're you're

226.31 --> 229.6
literally making this [ __ ] up

236.58 --> 253.62
good you go get that Nobel Prize you do

242.46 --> 256.17
that that means so much to you all right

253.62 --> 259.41
so yeah Daniel look there's this thing

256.17 --> 261.69
you know about education and polish

259.41 --> 263.82000000000005
always shouting you have to get the

261.69 --> 267.66
education because they got it

263.82 --> 269.64
and they invested a lot in it of their

267.66 --> 272.1
personal things sacrificed things for

269.64 --> 274.05
that so they will basically always tell

272.1 --> 275.97
you yeah you have to get that because I

274.05 --> 277.53000000000003
got it and that's why I'm smarter

275.97 --> 281.39000000000004
because I've been through all that

277.53 --> 285.75
personally well you know you can also

281.39 --> 288.81
talk to other people that have went

285.75 --> 291.09
through that and basically go through

288.81 --> 293.7
the details with a fine-tooth comb

291.09 --> 296.52
and if the person that went through it

293.7 --> 299.90999999999997
is actually any kind of good he'll be

296.52 --> 303.53999999999996
able to like a teacher himself explained

299.91 --> 306.87
it properly to you the non studied

303.54 --> 308.66
person in order to really make it

306.87 --> 313.16
understood how it works

308.66 --> 316.26000000000005
so it's just a [ __ ] excuse Daniel

313.16 --> 318.48
look I've been talking with very

316.26 --> 323.28
freaking smart and educated people and

318.48 --> 325.68
free thinkers all my life okay

323.28 --> 329.94
I don't need a freaking piece of paper

325.68 --> 331.86
and a bunch of routines and tests in

329.94 --> 333.96
order to make me knowledgeable I just

331.86 --> 336.77000000000004
gathered the knowledge when I came

333.96 --> 336.77
across it

337.56 --> 346.73
[Music]

339.16 --> 350.51000000000005
no no but entropy is entropy is an

346.73 --> 353.48
effect it's like a standard effect

350.51 --> 356.99
thinks that happen everywhere it's them

353.48 --> 361.28000000000003
it's like a sub structure within the

356.99 --> 364.55
fractal of how reality has basically

361.28 --> 368.08
manifested an entropy is part of that

364.55 --> 370.55
pattern within it and that is expansion

368.08 --> 373.07
expansion of gas pressure within the

370.55 --> 375.35
container of heat going to cold all

373.07 --> 378.74
these effects that motion that one-way

375.35 --> 382.67
motion that is entropy and it is very

378.74 --> 385.34000000000003
well understood and that's basically

382.67 --> 387.41
what we are addressing the spirit of

385.34 --> 391.31
entropy basically that sounds kind of

387.41 --> 394.01000000000005
weird but if you go in more judicial

391.31 --> 398.72
terms like the spirit of the law that

394.01 --> 400.88
becomes very solid very specifically

398.72 --> 403.01000000000005
understood so I'm saying if we are

400.88 --> 406.79
basically addressing the spirit the

403.01 --> 411.34999999999997
wider meaning of entropy and that is

406.79 --> 413.6
based on natural law basically the wider

411.35 --> 416.51000000000005
understanding of the effect of entropy

413.6 --> 419.03000000000003
within the system of all things is that

416.51 --> 423.49
natural law that's basically what we are

419.03 --> 426.38
addressing we understand Daniel and

423.49 --> 429.29
whatever you're like twisting in your

426.38 --> 431.6
mind presupposing that we have to get

429.29 --> 434.84000000000003
wrong in order for your freaking belief

431.6 --> 437.54
to become reality and twist everything

434.84 --> 439.60999999999996
that you actually have learned in order

437.54 --> 442.82
to manifest that that's your freaking

439.61 --> 446.27000000000004
psychological issue okay we definitely

442.82 --> 448.15999999999997
do get entropy here Daniel and I'm

446.27 --> 455.34999999999997
really getting sick of your attitude

448.16 --> 455.35
you're turning into a Brenda stop it

459.44 --> 464.13
you're not being productive here you're

461.94 --> 467.16
not asking good questions you're making

464.13 --> 469.26
stupid claims it's like the baller [ __ ]

467.16 --> 474.06
I don't need you in here if you're gonna

469.26 --> 478.25
be doing that now you know don't outstay

474.06 --> 478.25
your welcome here I'm serious

492.46 --> 497.85999999999996
yeah yeah I seem to be a little bit more

496.27 --> 500.65
trigger bull than usual

497.86 --> 503.32
I guess this heat instead of just

500.65 --> 505.53999999999996
mellowing me out is actually basically

503.32 --> 510.88
and flaming me a little bit more to lash

505.54 --> 516.96
out and in general I

510.88 --> 521.47
I guess I'm despite my overall

516.96 --> 526.33
methodology methodological my

521.47 --> 528.82
methodologies my goals my focus I am

526.33 --> 532.5400000000001
still kind of really pissed off at the

528.82 --> 534.4300000000001
world in general like the average of it

532.54 --> 538.2099999999999
of what's out there and what people

534.43 --> 541.06
conduct like even the good ones what

538.21 --> 543.7
they let themselves get sunk into the

541.06 --> 548.4599999999999
lack of purity the complete disregard of

543.7 --> 553.3000000000001
purity systematically and I'm sick of it

548.46 --> 554.98
and I have been sick of it for a very

553.3 --> 556.9
long time and then you kind of forget

554.98 --> 558.4
about it until it slaps you back in the

556.9 --> 561.64
face how bad it really is

558.4 --> 564.04
and I can't really forget about it can't

561.64 --> 565.81
get it away I can take that sensory out

564.04 --> 567.91
because I'd have to chemically make

565.81 --> 570.28
myself into a psychopath in order to do

567.91 --> 572.64
that and I prefer not to if you know

570.28 --> 572.64
what I mean

580.61 --> 587.85
so yeah talking about psycho [ __ ] I

585.47 --> 589.62
addressed that cried Wales about it I

587.85 --> 594.5400000000001
don't think he's there but yeah I went

589.62 --> 598.519
to like a new coffee shop today and I

594.54 --> 600.3499999999999
don't like to do this but that was just

598.519 --> 602.88
insane

600.35 --> 604.38
like it was a new coffee shop I never

602.88 --> 606.899
even heard of it before it was on the

604.38 --> 612.42
industry terrain not too far away

606.899 --> 615.3
and now to be fair technically if I'd

612.42 --> 617.8199999999999
probably be able to like judge the

615.3 --> 620.04
cannabis quality it was probably okay I

617.82 --> 623.24
saw some there were some other people

620.04 --> 626.16
around they got stuff there as well and

623.24 --> 628.0790000000001
I take a look a look at that even got to

626.16 --> 630.5699999999999
smell some of it it was pretty good

628.079 --> 631.29
so not the quality but oh my god this

630.57 --> 634.8000000000001
place

631.29 --> 636.209
what the [ __ ] you know there's coffee

634.8 --> 638.13
shops all over the place and they're

636.209 --> 640.4899999999999
always full with artistic [ __ ] all over

638.13 --> 644.91
the place sometimes the left is through

640.49 --> 648.51
you know all the typical stuff but this

644.91 --> 653.85
place new know this place was actually

648.51 --> 655.92
like really it was it was called

653.85 --> 657.75
Colorado obviously it had called in the

655.92 --> 659.9699999999999
name Colorado and so I mean it's like oh

657.75 --> 662.1
wait so it's based on the legalization

659.97 --> 663.99
thing in Colorado branching out or

662.1 --> 666.4200000000001
something apparently it that is kind of

663.99 --> 669.779
what it's meant to be but what they

666.42 --> 673.68
didn't say is that in there are totally

669.779 --> 676.86
insane satanic Americans that have hung

673.68 --> 681.06
up pictures of demonic mutated people

676.86 --> 684.089
everywhere and freaking baby angels with

681.06 --> 688.41
impaled blood alley spouting all over

684.089 --> 693.87
the place with arrows that's like what

688.41 --> 695.91
the [ __ ] but you could smoke there cuz

693.87 --> 698.279
yeah who wouldn't want to smoke looking

695.91 --> 702.709
at all that you know let down your guard

698.279 --> 706.38
let it all sink in what the [ __ ] and

702.709 --> 708.51
there was like a mark and judge much

706.38 --> 710.569
about it was like a fully tattooed and

708.51 --> 710.569
pierced

710.879 --> 721.789
girl that look really I don't know I

716.399 --> 721.789
just she just made me uncomfortable and

722.66 --> 726.3589999999999
anyway

723.899 --> 729.209
yeah I'd out of courtesy I did by there

726.359 --> 731.1
and even kind of smoked something out

729.209 --> 734.2199999999999
there but I had to lit and now this

731.1 --> 736.229
sounds like fuzzy but I had to like

734.22 --> 738.72
literally erect a force field around

736.229 --> 740.369
myself and just force myself not to look

738.72 --> 743.97
at those paintings while I was smoking

740.369 --> 746.429
just to make a safe space in her because

743.97 --> 748.529
I realized like yeah yeah what I thought

746.429 --> 750.449
I don't know actually why I'm even

748.529 --> 752.369
smoking here maybe I'm doing this as a

750.449 --> 754.679
challenge because this place is freaking

752.369 --> 760.649
insane and I think I'm probably never

754.679 --> 763.799
gonna go here again but that happened no

760.649 --> 766.109
but like and other people there kind of

763.799 --> 768.66
didn't talk about it but they noticed as

766.109 --> 771.869
well so I said like yeah yeah the

768.66 --> 774.139
weights pretty good but I don't know

771.869 --> 778.919
what the [ __ ] is up with that freaking

774.139 --> 780.659
impaled bloody baby mutants there who

778.919 --> 783.539
the hell thought it was a good idea to

780.659 --> 784.739
hang that up in a coffee shop like what

783.539 --> 788.459
the [ __ ] man

784.739 --> 792.899
and they kind of agree so oh yeah and

788.459 --> 796.159
they had a weird freaky Bernie Sanders

792.899 --> 800.279
inhale smoking a joint painting as well

796.159 --> 804.389
so yeah another clue about what's going

800.279 --> 807.359
on over there so yeah I would experience

804.389 --> 818.05
something new was quite an experience

807.359 --> 821.23
but to be fair I'm not believing it yeah

818.05 --> 821.2299999999999
[Music]

822.44 --> 827.58
but yeah I'm not gonna say like oh it's

825.3 --> 832.05
the worst coffee shop ever because yeah

827.58 --> 839.58
the we seem kind of okay but it's not my

832.05 --> 841.41
thing not really maybe like 15 years ago

839.58 --> 842.7900000000001
I thought it would have been cool I

841.41 --> 846.48
would have been hanging around with my

842.79 --> 848.88
golf friends in that coffee shop but now

846.48 --> 856.28
no no thank you

848.88 --> 856.28
oh man how much I've changed seriously

863.44 --> 866.639
[Music]

868.019 --> 873.79
look I don't know how it even works like

871.66 --> 876.79
that kind of [ __ ] could definitely be

873.79 --> 879.1189999999999
like foundation sponsored I wouldn't be

876.79 --> 881.709
surprised at all if like sorrows like

879.119 --> 890.22
fun at that [ __ ] or something like

881.709 --> 893.169
really I don't know you know I

890.22 --> 895.2090000000001
as long as not every freaking coffee

893.169 --> 898.059
shop is like that then I'm just fine you

895.209 --> 900.459
know everybody can have their own thing

898.059 --> 902.529
they like apparently I'm not even

900.459 --> 904.8389999999999
accusing them of doing like secret

902.529 --> 908.439
satanic [ __ ] I'm not gonna go there and

904.839 --> 910.119
not being that ridiculous but it just in

908.439 --> 913.779
general there was definitely like

910.119 --> 915.73
something wrong with these people but

913.779 --> 917.859
yeah then again if I tell them about

915.73 --> 918.4590000000001
Flat Earth they might even like Oh My

917.859 --> 923.279
gods

918.459 --> 926.709
you lunatic and get out of here you know

923.279 --> 930.16
like how dare you suggest that God may

926.709 --> 935.41
be a real thing don't you know where you

930.16 --> 937.629
are we are in the 21st century we

935.41 --> 941.499
figured out through science that all the

937.629 --> 943.4490000000001
Bible was wrong and we are free to do

941.499 --> 947.019
whatever we want and we can grow as

943.449 --> 951.699
insane and demonic as just description

947.019 --> 955.329
wise as we like hmm and don't you get in

951.699 --> 959.079
our faces with your being normal and

955.329 --> 965.049
[ __ ] okay don't you dare be to normal or

959.079 --> 969.1289999999999
to nice-looking and when I mean nice I

965.049 --> 972.66
mean like not in a gay way yeah anyway

969.129 --> 975.66
I'm going off in a stupid tangent yes I

972.66 --> 975.66
just

982.149 --> 992.689
and the freaky thing is something like

988.339 --> 995.139
that like the leftist angle as it were

992.689 --> 998.5989999999999
to what that coffee shop represented

995.139 --> 1000.399
like if they touch just the overdid it a

998.599 --> 1002.999
little bit less it would have actually

1000.399 --> 1006.399
been kind of interesting like a more

1002.999 --> 1009.549
hallucinogenic world and not it was just

1006.399 --> 1014.709
so freakin grim and hateful and just

1009.549 --> 1017.439
yeah you know right cool that's cool

1014.709 --> 1027.99
yeah okay I'll shut up about this [ __ ]

1017.439 --> 1030.61
oh yeah I wasn't josé's yesterday I

1027.99 --> 1032.919
don't know I don't know how active I was

1030.61 --> 1037.329
no no I don't think I was too active I

1032.919 --> 1040.48
like got tired out at some point they

1037.329 --> 1042.819
were just blurting their ball [ __ ] and

1040.48 --> 1046.0
constantly and it just got a headache

1042.819 --> 1051.899
and didn't have the energy left to get

1046.0 --> 1051.899
into it so I just like yeah

1056.44 --> 1062.3600000000001
yeah ego planes ego plane in anchor the

1061.07 --> 1067.0
F is gravity

1062.36 --> 1067.0
it's a presupposition it's a system

1074.149 --> 1081.1689999999999
Oh hmm okay stopping traffic I'm arrests

1078.619 --> 1083.809
that I haven't heard I just figured out

1081.169 --> 1086.779
who Nathan Thompson is by the way he was

1083.809 --> 1090.379
on jose's as well I was with him on the

1086.779 --> 1092.329
panel he doesn't seem to be too

1090.379 --> 1097.849
technical but he has a good memory for

1092.329 --> 1099.889
examples so he has his own channel he

1097.849 --> 1103.629
seems to have a lot of more old-school

1099.889 --> 1107.089
people in his chats and everything I saw

1103.629 --> 1109.579
even David wise in there I did subscribe

1107.089 --> 1111.829
to him now I do recognize him from way

1109.579 --> 1114.259
back but I didn't really like it too

1111.829 --> 1117.019
much back then I'll I'll give it a

1114.259 --> 1119.479
second chance but I didn't know that he

1117.019 --> 1126.169
had debated my quest when did that

1119.479 --> 1126.979
happen with held by IPS I have no idea

1126.169 --> 1129.5790000000002
what you mean with that

1126.979 --> 1129.579
rest huh

1134.39 --> 1138.88
hello Hoagy Templars

1156.03 --> 1162.59
oh okay yep I got a lot of those

1166.95 --> 1176.69
hello Major Tom good bye Major Tom what

1174.239 --> 1176.69
did he do

1179.66 --> 1182.2
and

1182.33 --> 1185.859
he just said hi

1202.15 --> 1217.21
music man oh you meant music man yeah

1208.51 --> 1217.87
that's a little root there music man ok

1217.21 --> 1220.45
I get it

1217.87 --> 1222.3999999999999
yeah it just moved right when you wanted

1220.45 --> 1224.97
to do it I get it that happens sometimes

1222.4 --> 1224.97
ah

1226.029 --> 1229.529
I'm gonna enjoy this Apple

1241.71 --> 1252.19
well what did i do yesterday I went a

1246.82 --> 1254.86
bit to bed really freaking early I think

1252.19 --> 1259.72
like even before no no was just after 12

1254.86 --> 1261.8799999999999
and I guess that's a good thing because

1259.72 --> 1264.46
in the morning I was like literally at 8

1261.88 --> 1273.7600000000002
o'clock I was getting cooked by the Sun

1264.46 --> 1276.79
here mm-hmm okay look stopping traffic

1273.76 --> 1282.8799999999999
him arrest that I had no idea it is

1276.79 --> 1284.53
there a video if it's somewhere good

1282.88 --> 1287.16
yeah if you could link me up on skype

1284.53 --> 1287.16
that would be good

1311.96 --> 1321.14
all right well down covered I am pretty

1316.89 --> 1325.2900000000002
sure that there's no outer space vacuum

1321.14 --> 1330.0600000000002
of any kind there may be a very large

1325.29 --> 1332.1
space up there in some fashion but it's

1330.06 --> 1337.11
gonna be filled with gas pressure of

1332.1 --> 1339.4399999999998
some kind or maybe other weird an

1337.11 --> 1343.8899999999999
earthly setups

1339.44 --> 1347.4
maybe it's like weird cold situations

1343.89 --> 1349.2
that just make the irregular chemistry

1347.4 --> 1351.51
of gas completely different I don't know

1349.2 --> 1355.16
but there's definitely not a vacuum

1351.51 --> 1359.66
anywhere in nature

1355.16 --> 1359.66
yeah not out in the open so

1366.22 --> 1369.309
[Music]

1378.46 --> 1382.57
and airspace

1403.14 --> 1405.17
ooh

1408.46 --> 1422.3
I'm sorry I try to eat with my mouth

1412.85 --> 1425.78
closed I could try to eat the eat it

1422.3 --> 1429.3999999999999
like the Cookie Monster but yeah let's

1425.78 --> 1429.3999999999999
not do that that's gonna get messy

1447.24 --> 1454.2
of course you are chocolate jeez I don't

1452.92 --> 1459.1200000000001
know if you can see it but I'm like

1454.2 --> 1469.89
literally sweating from the heat yeah

1459.12 --> 1469.8899999999999
it's freaking hot like not funny hot god

1483.03 --> 1488.1499999999999
man

1485.54 --> 1490.94
if this keeps up I'm gonna have to do

1488.15 --> 1495.0800000000002
this bare-chested or something it's just

1490.94 --> 1499.1000000000001
too freaking hot let's just start by

1495.08 --> 1503.1999999999998
taking off my shoes that doesn't exactly

1499.1 --> 1503.1999999999998
help this kind of heat so

1513.9 --> 1520.0500000000002
yeah great idea righteous force let's

1516.69 --> 1523.5
just you know that's let's just turn our

1520.05 --> 1526.62
went into a clown show to reinforce the

1523.5 --> 1527.13
quality of my previous arguments that'll

1526.62 --> 1530.4499999999998
work

1527.13 --> 1530.45
they'll work perfectly

1546.68 --> 1558.19
and it's not like I'm ashamed of my

1549.26 --> 1560.51
upper body seriously but I don't know I

1558.19 --> 1563.71
think that if I'm gonna take off these

1560.51 --> 1566.93
shoes that's gonna cool me off plenty

1563.71 --> 1568.67
maybe I'm just gonna sit stand over

1566.93 --> 1570.5
there for a while because it is really

1568.67 --> 1572.18
the wind is blowing so it should help

1570.5 --> 1574.54
them it cool off let me get back to you

1572.18 --> 1574.54
in a minute

1597.87 --> 1607.59
ah that was good but yeah second day of

1605.159 --> 1610.0700000000002
June it's cooking here in the

1607.59 --> 1610.07
Netherlands

1658.1 --> 1666.26
try wearing a lighter color I could do

1662.33 --> 1669.08
that but I'm pretty sure that if I did

1666.26 --> 1673.22
that like for example a white shirt and

1669.08 --> 1676.22
I do have like one or two I'm pretty

1673.22 --> 1679.7
sure that if I keep keep on wearing that

1676.22 --> 1683.24
it's probably gonna get pretty dirty

1679.7 --> 1687.19
like in just a couple of days just heat

1683.24 --> 1687.19
but uh maybe you have a point

1691.52 --> 1694.6399999999999
[Music]

1697.38 --> 1704.0900000000001
what the [ __ ] flatlander that doesn't

1699.33 --> 1704.09
make any that supposed to be a joke

1704.6 --> 1709.82
all right yeah they like oh hi oh I

1707.49 --> 1714.929
technically a fan is kind of useless

1709.82 --> 1717.87
because I just have to take like three

1714.929 --> 1721.8300000000002
steps outside and I'm in the middle of a

1717.87 --> 1726.9289999999999
constant wind gale pretty much but it's

1721.83 --> 1729.629
just hot so even if I'd had a constant

1726.929 --> 1730.23
fan blowing on me hard it'd still be

1729.629 --> 1734.6
warm

1730.23 --> 1734.6
I just dry out a lot quicker pretty much

1783.48 --> 1791.58
hmm oh right I see pump I see Jessica is

1789.46 --> 1793.8990000000001
going into discussion here with Daniel

1791.58 --> 1797.08
careful with that because he'll never

1793.899 --> 1799.32
shut up if you really get going so know

1797.08 --> 1802.6589999999999
what you're getting yourself into

1799.32 --> 1809.11
yeah it's a Yona gold Apple Daniel

1802.659 --> 1812.259
Valarie Valarie oh but look we know

1809.11 --> 1816.519
about the container is that there is one

1812.259 --> 1818.47
in some way and the antecedent is that

1816.519 --> 1822.879
he gassed must have come to an

1818.47 --> 1825.6100000000001
equilibrium state within the total

1822.879 --> 1828.1899999999998
container or everything could not be as

1825.61 --> 1831.309
it is right now but how that actual

1828.19 --> 1833.8300000000002
container or how you know is contained

1831.309 --> 1837.639
which must be technically possible in

1833.83 --> 1839.83
some way that's another matter

1837.639 --> 1842.769
and yeah physical barrier seems to be

1839.83 --> 1846.07
the most straightforward conceptualize

1842.769 --> 1848.559
abow for people because we can make it

1846.07 --> 1849.039
so yeah a maker could make it for the

1848.559 --> 1853.36
world

1849.039 --> 1855.19
that's basically it but yeah what if the

1853.36 --> 1858.639
very confines of the world the realm

1855.19 --> 1864.039
itself has natural containing elements

1858.639 --> 1868.149
and they would simply be a point a like

1864.039 --> 1870.61
a height a certain height where space

1868.149 --> 1875.4089999999999
simply ends and there is just a barrier

1870.61 --> 1879.039
to where matter can reach and anything

1875.409 --> 1884.3790000000001
would deflect from that edge that edge

1879.039 --> 1886.629
of space like a barrier and like a

1884.379 --> 1888.279
mirror it could literally it doesn't

1886.629 --> 1892.4189999999999
have to be a physical object it could

1888.279 --> 1894.1
literally be the edge of the well you

1892.419 --> 1896.8600000000001
could conceptualize it an edge of the

1894.1 --> 1900.009
simulation it's simply where the space

1896.86 --> 1903.85
ends like up to here no further matter

1900.009 --> 1908.289
simply can't move beyond that special

1903.85 --> 1910.48
point in any way yeah a barrier could be

1908.289 --> 1912.46
that as well doesn't have to be material

1910.48 --> 1915.039
it could simply be an end to this

1912.46 --> 1920.529
special confined

1915.039 --> 1920.529
as I said to overcomplicate things

1955.8 --> 1964.8
yep well for a niche that seems to be

1959.58 --> 1969.11
the trend in my chats overall lots of

1964.8 --> 1969.11
bickering and lots of tomfoolery

1970.82 --> 1974.96
sometimes some good questions though

1980.4 --> 1983.0
yeah

1984.48 --> 1995.91
but yeah you know technically I wouldn't

1991.44 --> 1999.18
be surprised if we really like at some

1995.91 --> 2001.7900000000002
point get to very very very seriously

1999.18 --> 2005.18
explore the confines of the world like

2001.79 --> 2006.83
NASA has been ditched like okay you can

2005.18 --> 2008.96
just focus on your freaking dream

2006.83 --> 2012.02
universe and we're going to actually

2008.96 --> 2015.89
explore it now there's no more monopoly

2012.02 --> 2019.25
on that [ __ ] and you can just yeah get

2015.89 --> 2021.8300000000002
company based xxxx yeah expeditions to

2019.25 --> 2023.69
do that maybe military guided but

2021.83 --> 2025.25
they're not gonna actually obscure [ __ ]

2023.69 --> 2028.67
anymore they're gonna let you try out

2025.25 --> 2031.28
things hopefully we'll get there at some

2028.67 --> 2033.28
point and then I would be surprised if

2031.28 --> 2039.1399999999999
you had scenarios where we would be like

2033.28 --> 2042.11
some kind of ship or like a sorry

2039.14 --> 2044.0600000000002
another type of Zeppelin that could

2042.11 --> 2047.3799999999999
potentially go up incredibly high

2044.06 --> 2052.49
somehow maybe even with people in them

2047.38 --> 2057.08
and that you just like bump into the

2052.49 --> 2060.7599999999998
edge boom and you just stick there and

2057.08 --> 2064.31
while you're looking at that edge you

2060.76 --> 2068.6600000000003
literally see just the Sun coming

2064.31 --> 2071.36
through it from the other side as it

2068.66 --> 2073.85
always looks like it obviously that is

2071.36 --> 2077.2400000000002
the end to where space goes but the Sun

2073.85 --> 2081.49
will still be may still be visible

2077.24 --> 2084.1699999999996
beyond that and more light phenomena

2081.49 --> 2086.2099999999996
because I'd yeah it is holographic in

2084.17 --> 2088.13
nature and it's like the light itself

2086.21 --> 2093.25
doesn't seem to be confined by this

2088.13 --> 2095.9300000000003
physical realm in a in a linear way

2093.25 --> 2098.78
enough portals it's simply extra

2095.93 --> 2103.0099999999998
dimensional and origin by the nature of

2098.78 --> 2106.34
it of the light itself manifests into

2103.01 --> 2109.73
the third dimension in a specific way

2106.34 --> 2112.75
that defies the normal spatial confines

2109.73 --> 2112.75
of this realm

2127.9 --> 2137.01
don't don't talk like that in my Chad

2130.51 --> 2137.01
AGM please that's ridiculous

2142.0 --> 2149.38
like oh and Schroyer is not a Zionist

2145.9 --> 2153.1600000000003
okay he's actually pretty damn open

2149.38 --> 2156.099
about that stuff and he's even defended

2153.16 --> 2158.41
flat-earthers free speech so I don't get

2156.099 --> 2163.3300000000004
why while you're saying anything like

2158.41 --> 2167.02
that yeah yeah I am because they're also

2163.33 --> 2170.5
defending us some of them don't be dick

2167.02 --> 2175.65
hm don't be a stupid polarized [ __ ]

2170.5 --> 2179.34
about these things we're all the same

2175.65 --> 2184.09
oppositional team in a way

2179.34 --> 2187.48
despite their weird entanglements and

2184.09 --> 2197.44
business that's right in force isn't so

2187.48 --> 2201.19
bad indeed and look the bad is blatantly

2197.44 --> 2203.859
obvious if you get Flat Earth then you

2201.19 --> 2205.93
know what is potentially good and bad in

2203.859 --> 2207.64
that but if you're then gonna over

2205.93 --> 2209.68
generalize it like as you look at it

2207.64 --> 2212.3489999999997
it's like oh look he's doing this bad

2209.68 --> 2215.109
and he's doing that bad he's doing that

2212.349 --> 2218.26
bad oh look he's constructing like a

2215.109 --> 2221.41
wizardry 3 thing to fear pouring people

2218.26 --> 2223.9
and then you yeah then that's the only

2221.41 --> 2226.6299999999997
thing left for you to see and you don't

2223.9 --> 2229.54
see all the other stuff that's going on

2226.63 --> 2232.27
there because you got so triggered you

2229.54 --> 2234.88
got obsessed with everything bad now

2232.27 --> 2237.7599999999998
there's a serious psychological issue

2234.88 --> 2240.07
with a lot of people here especially if

2237.76 --> 2242.1400000000003
let earth once you start seeing

2240.07 --> 2244.06
something bad you become so obsessed

2242.14 --> 2248.8199999999997
you're blinded to everything else about

2244.06 --> 2248.82
it you got a problem

2252.0 --> 2263.91
no no look Alex Jones seems to be kind

2259.66 --> 2266.68
of like bucking around saying like yeah

2263.91 --> 2268.95
screw you I'm gonna be pro-israel I

2266.68 --> 2271.75
don't give a [ __ ] you can all die

2268.95 --> 2273.73
basically that's his stance on it like

2271.75 --> 2276.85
[ __ ] everything I'm going with this and

2273.73 --> 2281.32
for the rest I'll just gonna do what

2276.85 --> 2283.93
I've been doing that it's like hey

2281.32 --> 2287.26
that's him okay that's not everyone else

2283.93 --> 2289.6
and everyone else if you ever heard

2287.26 --> 2291.2700000000004
anybody bought Alex Jones himself speak

2289.6 --> 2296.31
on the Alex Jones Show and there's like

2291.27 --> 2299.65
six to ten people over the weeks and

2296.31 --> 2303.18
that speak like it's Alex Jones himself

2299.65 --> 2305.5
even like speaks maybe 15% these days

2303.18 --> 2307.1499999999996
doing the other stuff and constantly

2305.5 --> 2309.58
repeating advertisements where he speaks

2307.15 --> 2311.83
that's what he does mostly okay but the

2309.58 --> 2315.1
other crew members actually have their

2311.83 --> 2318.72
own opinion and speak against it say

2315.1 --> 2318.72
that they don't like that kind of thing

2318.87 --> 2327.31
yeah I rob do is not my thing either so

2323.59 --> 2332.02
it's a mixed bag but look Owen Schroyer

2327.31 --> 2335.43
is a pretty good lad you say and he's

2332.02 --> 2338.62
learning visibly and there's other guys

2335.43 --> 2341.47
like David Knight seems to be very much

2338.62 --> 2343.21
containing himself but he isn't like a

2341.47 --> 2345.1
Zionist at all

2343.21 --> 2347.59
it's a very more principled libertarian

2345.1 --> 2350.65
but he's just not gonna go all whiney

2347.59 --> 2354.7000000000003
pants about it but every time it's asked

2350.65 --> 2357.37
he'll say that so don't be so judgmental

2354.7 --> 2360.0899999999997
and over generalize all that [ __ ]

2357.37 --> 2360.0899999999997
constantly

2362.66 --> 2373.6499999999996
our generalization is a disease of the

2366.29 --> 2376.109
mind it's a sign of fatigue it's a sign

2373.65 --> 2376.59
of mental fatigue that you can't take it

2376.109 --> 2380.84
anymore

2376.59 --> 2385.71
so you basically abandon more in-depth

2380.84 --> 2387.3
honest conceptualization of what is

2385.71 --> 2389.52
going on in trade for an

2387.3 --> 2390.96
oversimplification in order to make it

2389.52 --> 2401.79
easy for you it's a sign of mental

2390.96 --> 2403.55
fatigue over generalization I'm not

2401.79 --> 2410.67
denying anything

2403.55 --> 2412.8590000000004
rasa I basically explained literally in

2410.67 --> 2418.9700000000003
detail what is going on don't be a

2412.859 --> 2422.0699999999997
patronizing dick and you know I'm right

2418.97 --> 2424.9199999999996
so don't try to throw more oil on that

2422.07 --> 2428.1800000000003
fire because it's burning brightly okay

2424.92 --> 2428.1800000000003
we don't need more fuel

2432.73 --> 2439.829
yeah accurately I said yeah Alec Jones

2437.14 --> 2444.94
is a shameful Zionists pro-zionist

2439.829 --> 2452.28
that's what I said Raza don't time Rasta

2444.94 --> 2457.66
out for niche that's that's like that's

2452.28 --> 2461.19
done I'm in the middle of a discussion

2457.66 --> 2464.5789999999997
with him okay

2461.19 --> 2464.579
what the [ __ ]

2489.49 --> 2498.29
wait they like how you're not really

2494.17 --> 2499.869
okay I thought you were you've been

2498.29 --> 2503.02
hanging around forever

2499.869 --> 2503.02
the year

2518.01 --> 2536.6800000000003
hmm yeah ate that Apple to the very to

2526.32 --> 2538.9700000000003
the very core so

2536.68 --> 2543.8289999999997
[Music]

2538.97 --> 2546.95
anyway yeah maybe in retrospect is good

2543.829 --> 2548.3
that that happened but ya don't time

2546.95 --> 2551.21
people out when I'm in the middle of a

2548.3 --> 2558.38
discussion with them if they need timing

2551.21 --> 2560.21
out I'll be the one doing that but yeah

2558.38 --> 2563.48
I thought it was pretty clear about the

2560.21 --> 2567.56
whole situation with Alex Jones he is

2563.48 --> 2571.849
definitely out there like defiantly

2567.56 --> 2573.44
openly sought pros honest and he's open

2571.849 --> 2576.67
about it and he's honest about it and

2573.44 --> 2579.7400000000002
it's not good that he is that but it's

2576.67 --> 2583.819
you know people make choices even if

2579.74 --> 2586.6699999999996
they're wrong choices no matter yeah but

2583.819 --> 2589.79
basically how other people conceptualize

2586.67 --> 2592.79
or over generalize that that doesn't

2589.79 --> 2595.94
mean [ __ ] and if that means that Oh from

2592.79 --> 2599.18
now on he did this thing so now he must

2595.94 --> 2602.0
die or that kind of [ __ ] or now he must

2599.18 --> 2604.6699999999996
be [ __ ] on until he's basically quit and

2602.0 --> 2608.569
then just kills himself or something

2604.67 --> 2614.079
that now that's just psychotic troll

2608.569 --> 2614.079
thing you know

2621.31 --> 2629.2
all right i like alex jones sora de i

2625.95 --> 2635.74
think he's kind of a very serious dick

2629.2 --> 2639.31
in a way and I wouldn't honestly really

2635.74 --> 2642.7
want to be his personal friend I think

2639.31 --> 2645.5499999999997
he's probably a very compulsive personal

2642.7 --> 2648.6099999999997
manipulator with people like a control

2645.55 --> 2651.88
freak and I've seen that reflected even

2648.61 --> 2654.67
in life footage and that's just his

2651.88 --> 2658.3
character which is like a he's

2654.67 --> 2660.55
constantly on fire and that means he's

2658.3 --> 2664.7200000000003
always burning and always doing

2660.55 --> 2667.02
something very actively in some way and

2664.72 --> 2670.54
that can include being a dick or

2667.02 --> 2677.38
manipulative or opinionated that's just

2670.54 --> 2680.95
how he is I get it yeah

2677.38 --> 2682.9
Angry Men you know that in Asia most

2680.95 --> 2687.04
regions in Asia Alex Jones is just

2682.9 --> 2688.83
simply recognized as angry man and they

2687.04 --> 2692.68
think it's funny especially in Japan

2688.83 --> 2694.6
they think it's like yeah he's funny how

2692.68 --> 2697.6
he gets angry and his message is good

2694.6 --> 2700.12
it's very basic because Japanese don't

2697.6 --> 2703.0899999999997
let them their culture get totally

2700.12 --> 2705.19
screwed over although they have their

2703.09 --> 2709.21
own faction that does that from another

2705.19 --> 2713.4
angle but they're still in their

2709.21 --> 2717.76
national national ISM are still yeah

2713.4 --> 2720.48
common sense based or like really right

2717.76 --> 2723.4
ring as we used to think in the night

2720.48 --> 2725.34
like a little xenophobic but yeah that

2723.4 --> 2728.9700000000003
that kind of pays off in a way

2725.34 --> 2732.9100000000003
especially in these types of ages so

2728.97 --> 2735.3399999999997
yeah you don't know everybody has their

2732.91 --> 2736.72
own angle in different regions of the

2735.34 --> 2739.09
world and the different types of

2736.72 --> 2741.37
cultural understandings and certain

2739.09 --> 2743.4100000000003
levels of feeling for things or the lack

2741.37 --> 2745.66
of feeling which makes everything

2743.41 --> 2749.5499999999997
different how they will interpret and

2745.66 --> 2752.45
use media information and memes and

2749.55 --> 2755.88
feelings so

2752.45 --> 2758.5499999999997
you know just because we are in a

2755.88 --> 2761.79
certain position in certain countries in

2758.55 --> 2764.07
a certain political situation and we

2761.79 --> 2765.93
feel about certain characters that

2764.07 --> 2768.78
doesn't mean that for example people we

2765.93 --> 2770.6099999999997
might technically or financially

2768.78 --> 2774.3
consider as our allies we'll think

2770.61 --> 2777.96
literally the same thing you know that

2774.3 --> 2779.76
would be Mitch misjudgment and there's a

2777.96 --> 2783.57
general problem I think with a lot of

2779.76 --> 2787.5600000000004
Europeans and Americans even more that

2783.57 --> 2791.36
they just don't understand that other

2787.56 --> 2794.04
cultures really think differently and

2791.36 --> 2796.92
then there's those that do and then

2794.04 --> 2798.96
choose to just like completely abandon

2796.92 --> 2806.46
their own culture and just become shape

2798.96 --> 2810.69
shifters for power and adapt to whatever

2806.46 --> 2824.18
culture is like primed pushed by the

2810.69 --> 2824.18
corporation's so yeah that was that

2828.88 --> 2839.88
oh yeah taking off my shoes definitely

2837.309 --> 2839.88
did the trick

2853.92 --> 2865.109
hmm all right yeah whoo nadine arsenic

2863.73 --> 2867.78
that's the weird thing about it

2865.109 --> 2871.29
if you're not used to it it's deadly

2867.78 --> 2873.03
toxic but yeah in small dosages you can

2871.29 --> 2876.18
get used to it there are certain types

2873.03 --> 2879.65
of nuts like almonds that naturally have

2876.18 --> 2882.75
some levels of arsenic arsenic in it and

2879.65 --> 2885.54
that's that's yeah let me give you a

2882.75 --> 2887.67
trade weird thing in the Netherlands we

2885.54 --> 2890.04
have a sinter Klass it's like Santa

2887.67 --> 2893.28
Claus but the Dutch version and one

2890.04 --> 2895.19
specific type of candy that is a compass

2893.28 --> 2898.92
with that is merciful

2895.19 --> 2903.7200000000003
now marzipan is literally like sugar

2898.92 --> 2907.859
with almond meal and I used to love that

2903.72 --> 2910.02
[ __ ] but yeah if you eat that you you're

2907.859 --> 2913.29
literally like eating lots of almond

2910.02 --> 2915.5099999999998
extract and if you're not yet I had

2913.29 --> 2917.43
moments where I almost poisoned myself

2915.51 --> 2919.619
because I'd never ate that [ __ ] and I

2917.43 --> 2922.109
was like awesome class and I would just

2919.619 --> 2924.54
stuff myself with like bags and bags of

2922.109 --> 2926.7599999999998
marzipan like a madman because I had no

2924.54 --> 2929.069
control over candy when I was little

2926.76 --> 2932.849
literally eating myself sick well I got

2929.069 --> 2934.95
like serious serious ill from that

2932.849 --> 2940.02
sometime and then a compass with like

2934.95 --> 2942.21
very very painful headaches so yeah it's

2940.02 --> 2944.63
all a matter of dosages like if you eat

2942.21 --> 2948.359
marzipan like all throughout the year

2944.63 --> 2950.7000000000003
yeah arsenic if you get like potentially

2948.359 --> 2953.22
deadly dosages that's not gonna harm you

2950.7 --> 2955.41
the to a deadly degree you'll get a

2953.22 --> 2957.93
shock from it maybe but you won't just

2955.41 --> 2959.91
immediately die well if you're not used

2957.93 --> 2963.359
to it at all then it can be potentially

2959.91 --> 2967.71
lethal so it's that's just a special

2963.359 --> 2971.67
thing about arsenic not all point it's

2967.71 --> 2974.04
not liked by you accumulative your body

2971.67 --> 2977.28
can break it down it's just that if it's

2974.04 --> 2979.349
overwhelmed then it becomes yeah then it

2977.28 --> 2981.3190000000004
just literally flips the switch in

2979.349 --> 2983.65
cripples you

2981.319 --> 2983.65
deadly

2989.72 --> 2992.41
yeah

2994.63 --> 2999.279
well proficient pirate I wouldn't know

2997.509 --> 3001.319
what my favorite part of living in

2999.279 --> 3003.869
Amsterdam is because I've never lived in

3001.319 --> 3010.249
Amsterdam my grandmother and mother

3003.869 --> 3012.989
lived in Amsterdam though and they

3010.249 --> 3017.009
thought they thought it was great

3012.989 --> 3019.17
I guess they loved Amsterdam I've never

3017.009 --> 3021.329
lived there to be fair I don't really

3019.17 --> 3025.92
like it all that much there's this weird

3021.329 --> 3029.67
atmosphere over there it's just it's

3025.92 --> 3031.529
just weird I like going there sometimes

3029.67 --> 3035.009
especially like if you're in a party

3031.529 --> 3037.519
mood it can be in but no I don't I don't

3035.009 --> 3037.5190000000002
know what's

3041.66 --> 3046.1299999999997
I don't know what's going on over there

3043.52 --> 3047.66
I did I don't know I just don't find

3046.13 --> 3050.6600000000003
Amsterdam that charming

3047.66 --> 3053.42
maybe it's because I'm Dutch you know

3050.66 --> 3055.7889999999998
all the tourists always know Amsterdam's

3053.42 --> 3059.329
like oh yeah what's what's the capital

3055.789 --> 3062.809
of Amsterdam it's the Netherlands oh you

3059.329 --> 3065.44
know that's that's International

3062.809 --> 3065.44
thinking

3074.3 --> 3085.8
well Voynich I wouldn't say that it's

3081.72 --> 3089.6099999999997
just that Amsterdam used to be like a

3085.8 --> 3095.1000000000004
celebrated true liberal hearth of

3089.61 --> 3098.34
freedom and tolerance and just like wild

3095.1 --> 3100.2
and wacky free will but since the weird

3098.34 --> 3102.96
freaky social justice worry [ __ ]

3100.2 --> 3106.0699999999997
happened yeah that got tainted with like

3102.96 --> 3108.89
all the demonic [ __ ] that was unleashed

3106.07 --> 3111.48
corporately that was decided to

3108.89 --> 3115.08
literally poison the entire liberal

3111.48 --> 3118.35
system everything that was basically

3115.08 --> 3120.93
resting on that liberal spirit it's all

3118.35 --> 3123.68
been taken with it so everything that

3120.93 --> 3126.2999999999997
was liberal and good has been poisoned

3123.68 --> 3129.23
culturally and energetically spiritually

3126.3 --> 3132.9900000000002
poisoned and Amsterdam is among that I

3129.23 --> 3134.85
think I think that is it but at the same

3132.99 --> 3138.2999999999997
time yeah it's all up to the people you

3134.85 --> 3140.19
know there will be like there's already

3138.3 --> 3142.11
so many people just sick of it and

3140.19 --> 3144.54
they're even like refusing to shut up

3142.11 --> 3147.4100000000003
about it now the yellow vest movement

3144.54 --> 3152.25
you know and that's not gonna grow less

3147.41 --> 3153.6299999999997
as in the yellow fest movements not

3152.25 --> 3155.61
gonna grow bigger and bigger bigger

3153.63 --> 3159.3
until like everyone is rioting

3155.61 --> 3161.55
necessarily but the general public

3159.3 --> 3163.86
getting sick of it that's gonna pretty

3161.55 --> 3167.4900000000002
much yeah go to a hundred percent

3163.86 --> 3169.4700000000003
eventually because the situation is not

3167.49 --> 3173.7
getting fixed by the establishment

3169.47 --> 3176.6699999999996
they're just closing the doors that's

3173.7 --> 3178.83
their policy now just saying like ya

3176.67 --> 3182.87
know it doesn't make sense but we're

3178.83 --> 3182.87
gonna do this and just try and stop us

3188.4 --> 3191.059
yeah

3193.5 --> 3198.06
well there is still just some great

3195.93 --> 3200.49
places in Amsterdam look I'm not saying

3198.06 --> 3203.72
like oh my god Amsterdam is no totally

3200.49 --> 3207.54
evil and every dark alley you go like a

3203.72 --> 3212.0099999999998
weirdo demon or drug figure is gonna Rob

3207.54 --> 3216.21
you no no it's not like that as far as I

3212.01 --> 3218.7900000000004
know I I don't think it's become that

3216.21 --> 3223.05
bad in such a short time last time I was

3218.79 --> 3225.84
there as like 4 years ago I think pretty

3223.05 --> 3228.8590000000004
much felt the same it's just that you

3225.84 --> 3232.4700000000003
know like when you go into into nature

3228.859 --> 3235.71
you kind of like try to get away maybe

3232.47 --> 3240.33
from the city things and electronics and

3235.71 --> 3242.64
noise and like like open open up your

3240.33 --> 3244.92
spirit you know and just breathe well

3242.64 --> 3246.8689999999997
some people have that with cities and

3244.92 --> 3248.55
they likes it like to go like certain

3246.869 --> 3250.7400000000002
specific type of cities because that

3248.55 --> 3253.44
type of energy atmosphere and the drive

3250.74 --> 3256.31
that's that appeals to them so they

3253.44 --> 3259.17
didn't open themselves up to that well

3256.31 --> 3261.869
if you'd open yourself up to Amsterdam

3259.17 --> 3263.58
you'd feel like pretty ancient ties of

3261.869 --> 3265.4700000000003
energies and there's a lot of special

3263.58 --> 3269.0699999999997
things and including witchcraft stuff

3265.47 --> 3272.0099999999998
not necessarily all evil okay that is

3269.07 --> 3276.15
all tied in that place but you can

3272.01 --> 3279.119
definitely feel the corruption also like

3276.15 --> 3281.849
us like an inflammation within it you

3279.119 --> 3288.2000000000003
can feel it I can feel it

3281.849 --> 3291.9
when I get there it's yeah it ruins it

3288.2 --> 3293.5499999999997
you can't really openly breathe with

3291.9 --> 3296.4900000000002
your spirit there except for a few

3293.55 --> 3298.88
locations like very interesting types of

3296.49 --> 3298.8799999999997
parks

3302.98 --> 3310.13
it's not what does that have to do with

3306.23 --> 3312.95
resets look a reset is only a reset if

3310.13 --> 3316.34
you let the people that are screwing

3312.95 --> 3318.2
everything up and literally degenerating

3316.34 --> 3320.63
the general public into committing

3318.2 --> 3323.93
suicide and mass murder among one

3320.63 --> 3327.1400000000003
another if you let that happen yeah

3323.93 --> 3331.49
that's a reset then everybody dies it's

3327.14 --> 3334.5099999999998
a [ __ ] and literally revolution and

3331.49 --> 3337.04
eventually military and just it's gone

3334.51 --> 3341.4500000000003
nobody even remembers what it was like

3337.04 --> 3345.5
because there's yeah but that's only if

3341.45 --> 3346.33
you let it happen only if you let it

3345.5 --> 3349.37
happen

3346.33 --> 3352.61
and there's a big difference now in this

3349.37 --> 3354.38
age and a hundred and two hundred and

3352.61 --> 3357.1400000000003
three hundred years ago a lot of

3354.38 --> 3359.75
difference because now there's more in

3357.14 --> 3363.58
individuality culture and a resistance

3359.75 --> 3368.21
culture something that was really

3363.58 --> 3371.24
dangerous and unsafe in the centuries

3368.21 --> 3377.03
preceding this so they really couldn't

3371.24 --> 3380.27
stop it they didn't have the tools the

3377.03 --> 3383.9
individual tools to deal with it to

3380.27 --> 3387.11
defend against it really there were two

3383.9 --> 3389.63
enslaved by the controllers in a more

3387.11 --> 3392.48
direct sense now we're all free

3389.63 --> 3396.8
individuals we can actually freakin stop

3392.48 --> 3399.7400000000002
it like really stop it doesn't mean that

3396.8 --> 3402.02
we'll win yeah you know it can stop it

3399.74 --> 3405.56
and then basically end up having just a

3402.02 --> 3407.99
giant bomb thrown on it like oh okay all

3405.56 --> 3410.0299999999997
right they didn't make it they did they

3407.99 --> 3412.1899999999996
refuse to just be destroyed okay we'll

3410.03 --> 3414.4700000000003
just freakin bomb it and just say oh it

3412.19 --> 3417.8
was Isis or something and that [ __ ]

3414.47 --> 3420.02
could still happen it's very annoying a

3417.8 --> 3423.5
bit fear porn ish so just don't think

3420.02 --> 3426.65
about it but winning doesn't have to

3423.5 --> 3430.46
mean that it's over it could also mean

3426.65 --> 3433.15
the end but yeah if you don't do

3430.46 --> 3435.65
anything it's gonna mean the end and

3433.15 --> 3439.1600000000003
guaranteed hell

3435.65 --> 3441.62
so and I'm not just talking about the

3439.16 --> 3444.31
experience of Hell on this world because

3441.62 --> 3447.35
if you let that type of degeneracy go on

3444.31 --> 3448.85
it'll literally just start opening up

3447.35 --> 3453.47
portals to hell

3448.85 --> 3458.72
spirits and you get weird freaky

3453.47 --> 3461.81
nightmare [ __ ] and everything so but

3458.72 --> 3463.91
yeah people are much more awake much

3461.81 --> 3471.31
more willing to resist try things out

3463.91 --> 3475.8799999999997
and I don't think a reset is inevitable

3471.31 --> 3478.37
and yeah their designs have moved it's

3475.88 --> 3480.83
not like oh and nothing happens no

3478.37 --> 3483.38
there's things happening there's like

3480.83 --> 3486.77
even in the Netherlands with our

3483.38 --> 3489.53
politics there's like Trump effects

3486.77 --> 3493.46
happening and now again that's not a

3489.53 --> 3497.0
guarantee because like the President or

3493.46 --> 3499.79
a yeah the successful political power

3497.0 --> 3503.78
player is still bound basically by the

3499.79 --> 3506.72
system that he's dealing with and you

3503.78 --> 3510.0800000000004
can't just enforce everything constantly

3506.72 --> 3511.4599999999996
so even yeah anyone in politics even if

3510.08 --> 3512.99
you're on the right side you're still

3511.46 --> 3515.48
going to be relatively limited what

3512.99 --> 3520.2999999999997
you're capable of doing unless you got

3515.48 --> 3520.3
the entire system in your direction and

3520.75 --> 3527.29
unfortunately most of politics worldwide

3524.41 --> 3531.91
for with a few exceptions is just

3527.29 --> 3534.95
contaminated with these communist

3531.91 --> 3537.6499999999996
infiltrators that are anti societal

3534.95 --> 3540.9399999999996
ist's that literally want to destroy

3537.65 --> 3544.82
culture and make humanity commit suicide

3540.94 --> 3547.16
that's what they are and they're showing

3544.82 --> 3549.8
themselves to be exactly that more and

3547.16 --> 3551.66
more and more so it's up to you you want

3549.8 --> 3554.03
to go with that I think that's a good

3551.66 --> 3557.5699999999997
idea let's just all go delirious drink

3554.03 --> 3562.01
ourselves to death and go totally insane

3557.57 --> 3565.46
and go to hell or maybe I don't know

3562.01 --> 3569.15
take it a little easy don't exaggerate

3565.46 --> 3569.6
so much and just to try to find some

3569.15 --> 3572.44
common

3569.6 --> 3572.44
since again

3587.39 --> 3594.64
now you don't know that arrest uh you

3590.99 --> 3594.64
don't know what the [ __ ] the Bible is

3600.38 --> 3605.42
as far as I'm concerned the Bible is a

3603.71 --> 3607.37
freaking magical book that's

3605.42 --> 3611.09
extra-dimensional in the origin and was

3607.37 --> 3615.19
literally written by very powerful time

3611.09 --> 3618.3500000000004
transcending wizards that then appointed

3615.19 --> 3621.11
yeah did that in the name of a certain

3618.35 --> 3624.2599999999998
very special spiritual figure that was

3621.11 --> 3626.7200000000003
alive back then and they probably tried

3624.26 --> 3629.51
to fit that spirit into it very

3626.72 --> 3632.4399999999996
accurately and at the same time unleash

3629.51 --> 3634.88
wizardry over the future of the world

3632.44 --> 3637.82
that's how I pretty much see it at this

3634.88 --> 3640.1
point and then that wizardry basically

3637.82 --> 3641.0
was passed down and passed down until it

3640.1 --> 3642.95
yeah

3641.0 --> 3646.19
turned to the dark side became the

3642.95 --> 3649.16
freakin Sith Empire the Catholic Empire

3646.19 --> 3651.53
that then proceeded to have a long term

3649.16 --> 3653.8999999999996
plan to completely take over the world

3651.53 --> 3656.0600000000004
and turn it all inside out and make the

3653.9 --> 3660.32
entire humanity destroy itself

3656.06 --> 3668.69
permanently so yeah kind of switched

3660.32 --> 3671.0
there at some point let's not do it but

3668.69 --> 3678.68
then to claim that the book is fake as

3671.0 --> 3681.31
[ __ ] no it's too powerful there's too

3678.68 --> 3681.31
much in it

3681.96 --> 3689.739
the frequencies are too precise and

3685.329 --> 3693.2490000000003
meticulous to be filled as [ __ ] but it's

3689.739 --> 3695.89
probably very easy for the less

3693.249 --> 3700.269
spiritual and the less intellectual to

3695.89 --> 3702.219
basically nitpick or cherry-pick things

3700.269 --> 3704.4689999999996
out of it and then construct your own

3702.219 --> 3707.38
type of political narrative with it as

3704.469 --> 3710.2000000000003
has been done since the Roman times

3707.38 --> 3712.119
through the theocracy for ever power

3710.2 --> 3715.359
politics yeah it can you empower

3712.119 --> 3718.329
politics can use the spirit of any type

3715.359 --> 3723.839
of writing to manipulate their people

3718.329 --> 3726.21
any type of writing including gay poetry

3723.839 --> 3729.67
okay

3726.21 --> 3732.339
politics can use freaking gay poetry to

3729.67 --> 3734.829
manipulate people it doesn't matter what

3732.339 --> 3736.15
type of writing you have if it's the

3734.829 --> 3740.19
Bible whatever

3736.15 --> 3743.38
writing can be used to manipulate people

3740.19 --> 3745.839
very powerful very wise writing or very

3743.38 --> 3747.809
crazy writing it all depends on what's

3745.839 --> 3751.42
going on what people will typically

3747.809 --> 3754.21
respect however they're being programmed

3751.42 --> 3758.859
by their ancestors or by the state or a

3754.21 --> 3763.299
combination of both has nothing to do

3758.859 --> 3766.69
with the freaking Bible the theocracy

3763.299 --> 3771.059
had nothing to do with Christ and with

3766.69 --> 3774.549
the Bible Bible was just the tool they

3771.059 --> 3777.489
abused mind control everyone by taking

3774.549 --> 3779.849
everything entirely out of context and

3777.489 --> 3782.799
completely unravel the meaning of it

3779.849 --> 3785.17
concealing everything about it and using

3782.799 --> 3788.829
it as a tool to mind-control everyone

3785.17 --> 3791.349
and just yeah and slave people

3788.829 --> 3793.299
spiritually and it's kind of what the

3791.349 --> 3798.219
Satanists are doing right now in their

3793.299 --> 3800.7889999999998
own way from the other side but the same

3798.219 --> 3804.85
methodology interesting isn't it

3800.789 --> 3816.4
just do it they just do it

3804.85 --> 3818.49
hey so man I've been going for over an

3816.4 --> 3818.4900000000002
hour

3833.04 --> 3836.34
oops sorry

3838.18 --> 3841.25
[Music]

3842.63 --> 3847.65
mm-hmm that's a funny one righteous

3845.97 --> 3849.2999999999997
force cherry-picking Bible like how

3847.65 --> 3853.38
ballers cherry-pick flatterer to me a

3849.3 --> 3856.9100000000003
ball it's like a baller can pick up

3853.38 --> 3860.4900000000002
anything and turn it into a ball

3856.91 --> 3867.2999999999997
anything a baller can make anything into

3860.49 --> 3872.04
a wall it's like basically by the system

3867.3 --> 3875.28
of it yeah everything is technically a

3872.04 --> 3878.94
ball to a baller because it's so easy to

3875.28 --> 3880.65
presuppose and why not it has to be

3878.94 --> 3882.87
right if even the earth it has to be a

3880.65 --> 3885.75
ball then everything has to be a ball

3882.87 --> 3889.41
everything is balls you know molecules

3885.75 --> 3891.84
are balls particles are balls the Sun is

3889.41 --> 3894.39
a ball the everything is a freaking ball

3891.84 --> 3896.25
everything everything is a ball it has

3894.39 --> 3897.96
to be because the earth is a ball and

3896.25 --> 3899.76
everything looks like a ball when you

3897.96 --> 3903.65
think that it has to be a ball so

3899.76 --> 3903.65
everything must be a ball right

3909.0 --> 3919.26
nah not right but you kind of think of

3916.32 --> 3922.04
it as right I'm gonna get me some teeth

3919.26 --> 3922.0400000000004
should be downstairs

4008.41 --> 4011.04
yeah

4012.79 --> 4015.96
what's going on here

4019.63 --> 4032.349
and nobody's censoring comments at the

4022.059 --> 4039.0690000000004
moment except me specifically forbid

4032.349 --> 4041.7290000000003
people to do that so right proficient

4039.069 --> 4045.969
pirate well that's the thing you know

4041.729 --> 4048.91
every generation is always smarter than

4045.969 --> 4051.2490000000003
the older generation but that smarts

4048.91 --> 4053.3799999999997
starts to degenerate as they become

4051.249 --> 4055.089
discouraged during their life and from

4053.38 --> 4057.4590000000003
the poison basically they allow

4055.089 --> 4059.709
themselves to be unraveled because their

4057.459 --> 4062.469
intelligence becomes a burden because of

4059.709 --> 4064.989
the wisdom that they gain so every

4062.469 --> 4066.88
generation may be extremely smart in

4064.989 --> 4069.13
figuring things out but that doesn't

4066.88 --> 4073.2090000000003
mean that they'll be wise in the

4069.13 --> 4075.599
contrary the more information will be

4073.209 --> 4080.1699999999996
thrown out in the open and basically

4075.599 --> 4084.219
shoved in the face of young people the

4080.17 --> 4086.41
more they risk not becoming wise because

4084.219 --> 4089.289
the patterns the energies they've been

4086.41 --> 4092.44
confronted with at a very young figuring

4089.289 --> 4095.7690000000002
out stage have become erratic and wild

4092.44 --> 4098.079
so they'll be much less likely to get a

4095.769 --> 4101.259
good feeling for what is normal and

4098.079 --> 4106.389
logical when they get older and you have

4101.259 --> 4109.359
to realize that that is a very very very

4106.389 --> 4112.329
serious problem for the next couple of

4109.359 --> 4116.5
generations because they're gonna have

4112.329 --> 4118.239
to be like trained by the olders other

4116.5 --> 4122.109
people to really figure out what is

4118.239 --> 4123.79
wisdom instead of just what is wisdom

4122.109 --> 4125.71
for a freaking psychopath

4123.79 --> 4127.54
it's just win win win win win no matter

4125.71 --> 4130.54
the cost I'll sacrifice everything

4127.54 --> 4133.619
because that is what is now being

4130.54 --> 4136.409
forwarded to the youngsters as wisdom

4133.619 --> 4142.509
it's just yet wisdom to basically

4136.409 --> 4147.369
abandon everything to win so we have to

4142.509 --> 4151.449
basically safeguard what is what we have

4147.369 --> 4153.48
still seen as common sense in order to

4151.449 --> 4161.679999999999
safeguard that with

4153.48 --> 4165.0599999999995
for the future cause the wisdom of

4161.68 --> 4167.740000000001
future generation on average will be

4165.06 --> 4170.320000000001
crippled compared to the older

4167.74 --> 4173.8
generations just as the older

4170.32 --> 4176.38
generations were relatively not so

4173.8 --> 4178.96
technical as the newer generations

4176.38 --> 4181.09
instead they had more common-sense

4178.96 --> 4184.3
wisdom because it was in green where it

4181.09 --> 4188.68
was untalented it was not unraveled

4184.3 --> 4190.33
during that time but as they grew older

4188.68 --> 4192.610000000001
they couldn't figure it out anymore

4190.33 --> 4195.22
because the intelligence never was

4192.61 --> 4197.139999999999
capable of adapting to all the

4195.22 --> 4199.6
developments and the newer generations

4197.14 --> 4202.27
can do that but instead they're being

4199.6 --> 4205.4800000000005
confronted by completely derailed moral

4202.27 --> 4210.1900000000005
and spirituality so they will lack

4205.48 --> 4213.07
wisdom as they age compared to the very

4210.19 --> 4216.549999999999
much older generations and that's gonna

4213.07 --> 4220.2699999999995
be a lasting problem an overall an over

4216.55 --> 4223.05
generalized problem but not over just a

4220.27 --> 4229.56
general problem it's gonna be epidemic a

4223.05 --> 4232.93
cultural burden so I'm warning for that

4229.56 --> 4237.55
ahead of time and I hope that a lot of

4232.93 --> 4240.700000000001
really big ya youngsters have the

4237.55 --> 4247.51
courage and the Sharps to basically see

4240.7 --> 4250.21
this and try to like prepare and really

4247.51 --> 4251.95
want to go back to the roots of it all

4250.21 --> 4253.87
and see why all this [ __ ] has been

4251.95 --> 4255.46
censored and what's really gonna get

4253.87 --> 4257.62
into it but yeah you learn that over

4255.46 --> 4262.17
your lifetime if you really want to know

4257.62 --> 4264.849999999999
if you want to oppose the mainstream

4262.17 --> 4268.74
narrative that tries to turn you into a

4264.85 --> 4268.740000000001
psychopath so it's up to you guys

4277.809 --> 4283.659000000001
I know to me it's like it's like this is

4281.739 --> 4287.7699999999995
simple choice either you can have like a

4283.659 --> 4291.489
a very tough road that is very

4287.77 --> 4297.579000000001
challenging very painful but satisfying

4291.489 --> 4300.699
and honorable with like pride at the end

4297.579 --> 4303.46
as a promise at least rather take that

4300.699 --> 4306.46
road then the very short road where

4303.46 --> 4309.3
you're basically like yeah you just have

4306.46 --> 4312.52
to kill yourself and then you win I

4309.3 --> 4317.409000000001
prefer to take that challenging tough

4312.52 --> 4320.9800000000005
road where in the end I'll be left with

4317.409 --> 4322.808999999999
more than just the idea that I've won

4320.98 --> 4328.32
and that I've outsmarted everything by

4322.809 --> 4328.320000000001
just ending it really quickly you know I

4328.86 --> 4334.869
wish a lot of more a lot more people

4331.659 --> 4337.23
would have seen it the same way a lot

4334.869 --> 4337.23
sooner

4338.699 --> 4344.289
anyway I think I'm gonna round out the

4340.869 --> 4350.889
