it's yeah

129.84 --> 135.9
clouded yeah it's very much similar to

132.12 --> 138.8
yesterday it's clouded still but no rain

135.9 --> 138.8
clouds or anything

140.04 --> 144.84
there's a couple of blue spots in

141.959 --> 147.12
between there and then yeah lovely Sun

144.84 --> 151.52
comes through

147.12 --> 151.52
so yeah it's overall kind of a nice day

152.04 --> 157.70999999999998
might be getting more clouded though as

154.319 --> 160.61999999999998
time passes but we'll see

157.71 --> 163.459
[Music]

160.62 --> 163.459
all right

173.099 --> 180.72
hello DJ one deck house music first in

176.819 --> 187.56
chat Mike studunich good to see you

180.72 --> 187.56
it is Tuesday the 31st of May 2022

188.34 --> 191.599
last day of May

199.379 --> 202.64
how are you all doing

207.18 --> 211.92000000000002
yeah yesterday's Flat Earth early bird

209.22 --> 214.019
show was a blast

211.92 --> 215.64
didn't watch it back but I want to watch

214.019 --> 217.019
it back because I laid down a whole

215.64 --> 218.159
bunch of things and I kind of want to

217.019 --> 220.37900000000002
see it back

218.159 --> 223.85999999999999
but I'll get to it I gave it a title

220.379 --> 223.85999999999999
afterward uh

224.22 --> 228.319
dream walking diviner of men

228.48 --> 235.319
uh also yeah the Flat Earth debates was

232.5 --> 237.84
very interesting Nathan went full on

235.319 --> 240.67999999999998
baller

237.84 --> 240.68
and

241.56 --> 247.939
like he is more fanatical than Baldwin

244.14 --> 247.939
in the sense that he's not

248.36 --> 254.64000000000001
submissive in the sense that Baldwin is

252.0 --> 256.919
always like but there's another way we

254.64 --> 260.4
can get out of this right

256.919 --> 263.21999999999997
but never like really

260.4 --> 265.85999999999996
going in at homes unless it is really

263.22 --> 266.88000000000005
like a genuine criticism that can even

265.86 --> 269.58000000000004
be

266.88 --> 270.9
perceived from a non-hostile angle of

269.58 --> 273.06
approach

270.9 --> 275.88
but Nathan is just like really

273.06 --> 280.44
anti-flatter when he's doing that

275.88 --> 283.259
although not gamma spiraling too much

280.44 --> 285.419
but yeah I joined up with him as Bowen

283.259 --> 288.54
eventually this is

285.419 --> 290.28
because it's just really tough dealing

288.54 --> 293.78000000000003
with an anti-flater when they're

290.28 --> 293.78
actually in control of the room

295.979 --> 301.74
but yeah that's a new stick

299.16 --> 304.08000000000004
that Nathan is using

301.74 --> 308.24
it is kind of interesting I hope it

304.08 --> 308.24
doesn't go out of hand probably not

312.419 --> 316.979
but it is kind of funny because now it

314.52 --> 320.15999999999997
feels to me a bit like like I've been

316.979 --> 322.919
doing Baldwin for a while and now Nathan

320.16 --> 324.84000000000003
is doing that and the other guys like

322.919 --> 328.08
John

324.84 --> 332.06
uh refracted curvature John also has

328.08 --> 332.06
been kind of doing it and even Brian

332.82 --> 340.58
seems like 10th manage and especially

336.24 --> 340.58
Neil just can't get themselves to do it

341.4 --> 346.19899999999996
but it is funny because I feel like I

343.5 --> 348.539
kind of started a trend

346.199 --> 351.479
and hey it's a good development because

348.539 --> 353.88
you just learn so much

351.479 --> 355.31899999999996
right and you don't need to be subjected

353.88 --> 357.96
to like the

355.319 --> 362.16
the Demonic influence of people actually

357.96 --> 364.25899999999996
in it to train it now

362.16 --> 368.24
right so the flatters debate yesterday

364.259 --> 368.24
the live show especially was great

368.759 --> 371.72
hey Adam Price

376.319 --> 381.38
actually trying debating Glovers as

378.539 --> 381.38
globers yeah

384.12 --> 389.52
right

385.62 --> 393.36
the but the way to do it is to just know

389.52 --> 395.46
it all and not end up fooling yourself

393.36 --> 398.1
about it because you really believe in

395.46 --> 401.78
it and then you can just be the master

398.1 --> 401.78000000000003
of that structure

402.6 --> 407.1
like it's not that hard to correct

405.3 --> 408.66
Ballers when they're incorrect about

407.1 --> 411.06
their belief

408.66 --> 414.36
if you do it as a as a flat earther then

411.06 --> 415.74
they'll never listen really

414.36 --> 419.22
[Music]

415.74 --> 421.56
they'll just run scared but if you do it

419.22 --> 423.18
as a baller then they will realize like

421.56 --> 426.86
oh [ __ ] yeah

423.18 --> 426.86
you have might have a point there

427.319 --> 431.3
hey LSG it's you

434.52 --> 439.139
um

436.01 --> 439.139
[Music]

445.08 --> 449.039
right also been watching part of own

447.12 --> 452.479
Benjamin stream

449.039 --> 452.479
which is really interesting

453.78 --> 458.75899999999996
from this Monday

455.759 --> 458.759
and

471.84 --> 474.5
oh yeah

474.599 --> 480.479
yeah Jim Bob also went live

477.78 --> 482.4
I did sit through like a big part of it

480.479 --> 484.8
at the beginning but then I got a call

482.4 --> 487.13899999999995
from my friend and name it and that

484.8 --> 490.16
kind of lasted a while so I missed that

487.139 --> 490.16
the rest of the Stream

493.259 --> 499.259
I advised my friend to go and watch

495.84 --> 502.13899999999995
blueberry surprise surprise

499.259 --> 505.5
but I think like that that movie will

502.139 --> 507.419
like go straight to the right spot with

505.5 --> 510.78
her

507.419 --> 514.64
in many different ways

510.78 --> 514.64
because she is kind of like

514.919 --> 522.06
like

516.959 --> 524.039
raised like a classical Catholic like

522.06 --> 526.9799999999999
the good kind

524.039 --> 529.86
and one that's actually really inspired

526.98 --> 532.08
by like Saints and all that to really be

529.86 --> 535.26
a better person right not so much to

532.08 --> 537.12
just like our religion is right there

535.26 --> 540.36
because he isn't really even a Christian

537.12 --> 543.899
like that she's much more well

540.36 --> 547.26
inspired by Natives and all that like

543.899 --> 552.24
a bit of a hippie so like this movie is

547.26 --> 555.899
just like the style and

552.24 --> 558.779
that's perfect for her I think that

555.899 --> 560.399
gonna really hit the spot with her but

558.779 --> 562.56
she gets to watch that

560.399 --> 564.72
and she could use some because she's in

562.56 --> 567.3599999999999
general under a lot of tension from all

564.72 --> 569.339
sides always trying to figure away how

567.36 --> 572.76
to keep things

569.339 --> 575.339
keep her home balanced

572.76 --> 577.76
I think this movie will do some good

575.339 --> 577.7600000000001
anyway

586.56 --> 590.54
hey Tony Whitcomb good to see you

592.68 --> 596.279
ah

594.899 --> 599.04
right

596.279 --> 602.88
also continue watching

599.04 --> 605.04
the fourth season of stranger things

602.88 --> 607.92
and

605.04 --> 611.16
starting to spot a very distinct formula

607.92 --> 613.5
of what how this show works

611.16 --> 615.7199999999999
but

613.5 --> 618.12
yeah

615.72 --> 620.64
I didn't really like the turn of things

618.12 --> 624.24
but then again I'm

620.64 --> 626.399
like always expecting more growth curve

624.24 --> 628.8
from people especially when they go

626.399 --> 631.8
through really extreme situations it

628.8 --> 634.8599999999999
tends to make you grow up very quickly

631.8 --> 636.5999999999999
like it accelerates that part well

634.86 --> 640.5790000000001
that's something that I noticed like

636.6 --> 640.5790000000001
that doesn't really seem to be happening

643.019 --> 647.1
which makes it kind of weird and surreal

645.839 --> 650.3000000000001
but yeah

647.1 --> 653.279
it's just I don't know

650.3 --> 656.76
mechanist Perfection or something

653.279 --> 660.86
but yeah it's still pretty

656.76 --> 660.86
it's interesting and and

663.079 --> 669.0
yeah they are seeming to roll out what I

666.959 --> 671.2199999999999
expected they would do

669.0 --> 674.399
mainly that like

671.22 --> 677.22
the the coolest man character in the

674.399 --> 680.399
series who kind of died at or

677.22 --> 683.64
suggestively died

680.399 --> 686.399
that he would come back and yeah like

683.64 --> 688.6999999999999
it's not a big spoiler to say that that

686.399 --> 691.079
is the case because it's like really

688.7 --> 693.0600000000001
it's splitting up

691.079 --> 695.3389999999999
and you get to see like what's happening

693.06 --> 699.42
with him and how it all got there and

695.339 --> 701.0400000000001
all that pretty quickly so

699.42 --> 703.459
yeah we'll see what they're gonna do

701.04 --> 703.459
with this

709.5 --> 715.26
I don't know like how this

711.899 --> 717.959
Phantom creature opponent how that thing

715.26 --> 720.899
is really holding up though

717.959 --> 724.4399999999999
not really getting a deeper visceral

720.899 --> 726.42
feel to it thus far maybe they'll go

724.44 --> 727.5600000000001
They're gonna build up better to that

726.42 --> 729.36
even

727.56 --> 732.0
we'll see

729.36 --> 734.1
because now it it's just

732.0 --> 736.7
the way it looks now it's like almost

734.1 --> 739.38
more kind of a ghost slasher thing

736.7 --> 742.639
instead of

739.38 --> 742.639
like yeah

744.54 --> 749.88
well like the first season when it's

746.22 --> 752.639
really about the other dimension and

749.88 --> 754.8
and like getting a grip on how that

752.639 --> 756.0
works and all anyway we'll see what

754.8 --> 758.88
happens

756.0 --> 761.399
I'm not through the series just yet

758.88 --> 764.6
ah

761.399 --> 764.6
HF gas head

768.22 --> 771.369
[Music]

773.399 --> 779.76
33 degrees is location also dude 33 is a

777.779 --> 782.9399999999999
lot of things

779.76 --> 785.459
yes stranger things says Moretz the

782.94 --> 788.639
fourth season is out

785.459 --> 791.76
oh and like

788.639 --> 794.399
already noted it yesterday

791.76 --> 796.4399999999999
they they like threw Helen Kellen in

794.399 --> 798.54
there as as somebody's School

796.44 --> 800.899
presentation and that's just hilarious

798.54 --> 800.899
to me

801.959 --> 805.8
I wonder if like Owen Benjamin already

804.06 --> 808.1389999999999
picked up on that but he probably really

805.8 --> 810.0
doesn't care about stranger things

808.139 --> 811.8
or maybe he does and he has to wait

810.0 --> 814.2
until he's like in the right mood for it

811.8 --> 815.9399999999999
or something I don't know

814.2 --> 818.339
but that immediately stood out to me

815.94 --> 820.82
like hey they've been watching Owen

818.339 --> 820.82
Benjamin

822.24 --> 825.0790000000001
hmm

825.899 --> 832.279
you just finished the fourth oh okay

827.94 --> 832.2790000000001
well don't tell me about it please

840.839 --> 844.5
a Slow Burn yeah it is a bit of a slower

843.42 --> 847.8199999999999
burn

844.5 --> 847.82
it does seem like that

854.16 --> 858.779
right by the way L has just a very

856.44 --> 861.0
serious problem because like in this

858.779 --> 864.12
fourth season it's just very very

861.0 --> 866.519
telling that she had basically become

864.12 --> 869.94
addicted to her power

866.519 --> 871.8
she just took it as her own and now she

869.94 --> 873.24
yeah that's like the whole thing oh she

871.8 --> 876.18
doesn't really know what to do without

873.24 --> 877.8
it but then supposedly she's gonna get

876.18 --> 881.04
it back I haven't even gotten to that

877.8 --> 883.019
yet but but to me that's like

881.04 --> 886.019
nobody's telling her

883.019 --> 888.839
like nobody's like hello

886.019 --> 891.839
they're all just like we want El to have

888.839 --> 893.0400000000001
powers back it was so safe with her

891.839 --> 897.0
powers

893.04 --> 899.399
and nobody's like uh this girl is like

897.0 --> 901.38
seriously addicted to her powers because

899.399 --> 903.959
she can't even like normally function

901.38 --> 905.459
without it she doesn't know who she is

903.959 --> 907.56
without it

905.459 --> 910.0189999999999
and nobody's doing anything nobody's

907.56 --> 912.92
telling that Terror right now that's a

910.019 --> 912.92
thing that I'm like

914.94 --> 918.139
you should know better

918.18 --> 923.06
then again it is supposedly like the 80s

920.82 --> 923.0600000000001
so

923.1 --> 925.88
uh

927.61 --> 934.139
[Music]

930.54 --> 936.36
but I mean even even me if I was like

934.139 --> 939.0
their age in that time frame I was a

936.36 --> 940.92
little younger actually more 90 80.

939.0 --> 943.079
so I would have been like six or

940.92 --> 944.459
something

943.079 --> 946.9799999999999
but

944.459 --> 951.38
I would have definitely recognized that

946.98 --> 955.8000000000001
about her and just like really like hey

951.38 --> 959.899
this is a like you not dealing with you

955.8 --> 959.899
not having powers is a problem

960.72 --> 966.9590000000001
like do you know what you are without it

964.259 --> 969.54
you have to like figure out

966.959 --> 972.1199999999999
how to do things differently and have a

969.54 --> 975.7199999999999
different composure without this knowing

972.12 --> 978.38
and having this backup of this power

975.72 --> 978.38
anyway

984.779 --> 988.459
American God God

989.639 --> 994.44
that sounds terrible

991.92 --> 997.079
says Moretz like with a title like that

994.44 --> 999.5
that makes me absolutely not want to

997.079 --> 999.5
click that

1008.48 --> 1012.74
it's not really what you think yeah but

1010.639 --> 1015.86
the title is just

1012.74 --> 1018.82
per definition blasphemous

1015.86 --> 1018.82
it's ridiculous

1023.24 --> 1029.6200000000001
it's not really what you think yeah it

1025.4 --> 1029.6200000000001
has a a giant Blasphemous title

1031.14 --> 1034.279
[Music]

1036.919 --> 1043.5200000000002
that's like having a series

1041.419 --> 1047.3600000000001
that's like colds

1043.52 --> 1051.08
let's all love Satan right

1047.36 --> 1051.9799999999998
but it's don't worry it's a comedy it's

1051.08 --> 1055.1
funny

1051.98 --> 1059.559
right oh wait it's really funny yeah but

1055.1 --> 1059.559
it's called Let's Love Satan like

1060.38 --> 1063.38
um

1061.52 --> 1065.12
right

1063.38 --> 1068.2600000000002
those things matter

1065.12 --> 1068.26
titles matter

1083.71 --> 1086.769
[Music]

1088.98 --> 1092.029
[Music]

1095.299 --> 1099.86
I'm judging book

1097.22 --> 1103.72
by its cover

1099.86 --> 1103.7199999999998
no I actually am

1104.48 --> 1109.22
I'm not saying it's not a well-written

1106.82 --> 1112.039
story or anything or execute it's just

1109.22 --> 1114.32
that yeah I do actually judge a book by

1112.039 --> 1118.72
its covers I do

1114.32 --> 1118.72
because a book's cover matters

1128.0 --> 1133.1
I mean a book's cover isn't gonna tell

1131.48 --> 1136.16
you how well

1133.1 --> 1139.34
the book is written how valuable it is

1136.16 --> 1141.5
what is in there but it is

1139.34 --> 1144.32
kind of important

1141.5 --> 1146.299
and should definitely been taken into

1144.32 --> 1149.1789999999999
account with your judgment of it all

1146.299 --> 1150.559
because it is the freaking title it is

1149.179 --> 1154.64
the thing

1150.559 --> 1157.039
the formula that rests on top of it all

1154.64 --> 1159.919
and you're always going to be reflecting

1157.039 --> 1164.059
to that when you dig into it so yeah the

1159.919 --> 1167.8600000000001
title matters cover of a book matters

1164.059 --> 1167.86
it's what you get to see the most

1168.5 --> 1171.22
you see

1174.44 --> 1179.5
I've had nobody ever thought about that

1176.36 --> 1179.5
I do

1182.9 --> 1190.13
[Music]

1208.039 --> 1213.74
okay DJ one deck house music if you say

1211.76 --> 1216.22
so I have no idea exactly what you're

1213.74 --> 1216.22
talking about

1220.7 --> 1227.0800000000002
I don't see it tied to Lord of the Rings

1223.58 --> 1227.08
really with Saturn

1227.12 --> 1232.78
just because it is suggested to have

1230.36 --> 1232.78
rings

1232.82 --> 1237.62
doesn't really it's just a weird thing

1235.82 --> 1238.7
that you get to see always in the same

1237.62 --> 1241.2199999999998
way

1238.7 --> 1244.46
and then they'd like to give you the CGI

1241.22 --> 1248.0
version where it is a planet with rings

1244.46 --> 1250.58
but there isn't actually that's just

1248.0 --> 1253.039
what it kind of looked like and then

1250.58 --> 1256.039
this is what they made out of it

1253.039 --> 1257.72
from the heliocentric

1256.039 --> 1260.26
Department

1257.72 --> 1260.26
anyway

1293.72 --> 1298.88
God idiot lighting fireworks again in

1296.96 --> 1301.659
the middle of the daytime I have no idea

1298.88 --> 1301.659
why they do that

1303.53 --> 1308.78
[Music]

1305.9 --> 1311.299
I can hear it's like way over there

1308.78 --> 1313.84
not out here so

1311.299 --> 1313.84
uh

1319.34 --> 1324.86
right so guys

1321.62 --> 1327.82
laid down pretty much

1324.86 --> 1327.82
my day

1330.08 --> 1333.58
what do you want me to talk about

1345.64 --> 1348.989
[Music]

1362.659 --> 1365.659
hmm

1367.73 --> 1374.23
[Music]

1374.299 --> 1379.82
or everybody just don't say anything for

1377.059 --> 1382.8999999999999
three minutes straight ah

1379.82 --> 1382.8999999999999
just do that then

1391.76 --> 1400.179
let's go with the planets what are they

1396.14 --> 1400.179
they're weird lights in the sky

1401.0 --> 1405.26
and I have a strong suspicion no direct

1403.76 --> 1407.179
confirmation

1405.26 --> 1409.7
but I have a model

1407.179 --> 1413.6000000000001
before its approach I think that there

1409.7 --> 1413.6000000000001
are non-local Holograms

1414.74 --> 1418.6
ah thank you for sharing Matthew Hall

1421.96 --> 1428.299
meltology that is real no

1426.2 --> 1431.059
you mean that idiotic idea that

1428.299 --> 1433.1
everything used to be like man-made

1431.059 --> 1436.059
architecture and it was molten

1433.1 --> 1436.059
absolutely not

1436.1 --> 1441.9189999999999
this is the most disprovable concept

1438.74 --> 1443.96
ever it's it's it's Fantastical but it's

1441.919 --> 1446.179
dumb

1443.96 --> 1449.98
because if it's Molten

1446.179 --> 1453.7
that means there will be absolute direct

1449.98 --> 1456.679
signs that it is molten architecture

1453.7 --> 1459.6200000000001
everything about it internally will have

1456.679 --> 1464.179
to be molten so potentially there would

1459.62 --> 1467.6
be parts that wouldn't have been Molten

1464.179 --> 1471.44
right melting is on the surface like the

1467.6 --> 1473.6589999999999
deeper inside the less heat will reach

1471.44 --> 1475.52
there that means that whenever it then

1473.659 --> 1477.0200000000002
is going to collapse melt on top of it

1475.52 --> 1479.059
they're still going to be complete

1477.02 --> 1481.82
architecture in between there it has to

1479.059 --> 1484.1589999999999
be right you can't you can't never

1481.82 --> 1486.5
universally remove all proof of

1484.159 --> 1490.279
architecture

1486.5 --> 1493.34
and just be left with suggestive shapes

1490.279 --> 1495.26
that are all like one block that just

1493.34 --> 1499.48
doesn't happen

1495.26 --> 1499.48
there will be signs and there aren't

1502.159 --> 1510.5200000000002
if that is what you're referring to uh d

1505.1 --> 1510.52
b l d v r

1516.32 --> 1520.539
make more than ambient heat

1520.58 --> 1524.059
foreign

1521.96 --> 1526.58
well that's just

1524.059 --> 1529.34
a thing about it presupposing it already

1526.58 --> 1534.4399999999998
right but the thing is

1529.34 --> 1538.6399999999999
it isn't it just isn't there is Rock

1534.44 --> 1539.96
in mountains that are provably not

1538.64 --> 1543.14
Molten

1539.96 --> 1546.32
done over Black Swan

1543.14 --> 1548.419
look there's proof rocks

1546.32 --> 1551.24
that are still like part of a mountain

1548.419 --> 1554.0
whatever have like polonium rings in

1551.24 --> 1555.559
them immediate proof this has never been

1554.0 --> 1558.44
molten ever

1555.559 --> 1559.52
or these could not have formed oh you

1558.44 --> 1561.44
don't know how they could have been

1559.52 --> 1563.84
formed yeah so very mysterious creation

1561.44 --> 1566.3600000000001
and all that but one thing is sure it

1563.84 --> 1570.1399999999999
was never molten Black Swan

1566.36 --> 1573.34
not all mountains used to be molten

1570.14 --> 1573.3400000000001
buildings done over

1573.799 --> 1578.69
just cold hard fact

1575.51 --> 1578.69
[Music]

1591.74 --> 1598.46
someone shared that Norwegian guy

1595.6 --> 1601.3999999999999
whatever yeah video with me

1598.46 --> 1604.039
oh look these guys especially the

1601.4 --> 1606.5590000000002
tartarian mud flutters

1604.039 --> 1608.059
they are trying to kind of be Wizards

1606.559 --> 1610.58
and they're going all over the place

1608.059 --> 1612.98
right the problem is is that they're

1610.58 --> 1615.559
more concerned with telling

1612.98 --> 1617.3600000000001
seemingly cohesive interesting stories

1615.559 --> 1620.299
and keeping everybody all fascinated

1617.36 --> 1623.779
than they are with actually

1620.299 --> 1626.299
physically proving their assertions

1623.779 --> 1628.46
so what happens they end up making

1626.299 --> 1631.46
[ __ ]

1628.46 --> 1633.919
and there are like Devils all over the

1631.46 --> 1636.98
place evil people that are literally

1633.919 --> 1638.26
like looking over at the Flat Earth

1636.98 --> 1640.46
whatever

1638.26 --> 1642.44
tartari and mudflood Community they're

1640.46 --> 1645.52
literally looking there with giant piles

1642.44 --> 1645.52
of money waiting

1645.679 --> 1650.72
till like

1648.2 --> 1653.419
yeah this crowd becomes

1650.72 --> 1655.279
do like oh we don't know what to talk

1653.419 --> 1656.419
about anymore we're afraid people are

1655.279 --> 1658.58
gonna get bored we need to make

1656.419 --> 1661.3400000000001
something up oh guess who's gonna help

1658.58 --> 1664.279
you with that they got all these

1661.34 --> 1668.4189999999999
freaking cult programming [ __ ] already

1664.279 --> 1672.44
tested for like a hundred years

1668.419 --> 1675.98
and they'll be very happy to share some

1672.44 --> 1678.679
of those gold programming concepts with

1675.98 --> 1680.48
very eager wannabe Wizards that want to

1678.679 --> 1684.0800000000002
continue making very fascinating videos

1680.48 --> 1686.0
yet it's very easy for them to seduce

1684.08 --> 1688.399
people like that

1686.0 --> 1690.5
because all you have to do is wait

1688.399 --> 1691.9399999999998
till they come

1690.5 --> 1694.46
looking

1691.94 --> 1698.0
then you just show them what you want

1694.46 --> 1701.14
them to copy it's so easy

1698.0 --> 1701.14
so easy

1702.62 --> 1710.0
yeah it's so easy it's that easy

1706.88 --> 1711.679
yeah now you know now you know how this

1710.0 --> 1713.059
actually all works

1711.679 --> 1716.24
right

1713.059 --> 1718.46
the entire point of Flat Earth and

1716.24 --> 1721.039
figuring out the truth and figuring out

1718.46 --> 1724.64
how things are tricked and like is to

1721.039 --> 1727.58
test is to test to ensure not to make

1724.64 --> 1730.159
[ __ ] up that makes you dream

1727.58 --> 1732.559
and then not back it up

1730.159 --> 1734.0
and then make everybody hang on to that

1732.559 --> 1736.94
without

1734.0 --> 1738.919
the actual proof because then you're

1736.94 --> 1741.44
just putting them in a dream again just

1738.919 --> 1742.46
like heliocentrism you're doing the same

1741.44 --> 1744.8600000000001
thing

1742.46 --> 1747.2
just this malicious potentially even

1744.86 --> 1749.899
though you in that moment you might not

1747.2 --> 1752.8400000000001
have some ambition to call this mind

1749.899 --> 1754.9399999999998
control people but that is effectively

1752.84 --> 1756.799
what you're doing when you realize it or

1754.94 --> 1759.0800000000002
not

1756.799 --> 1762.32
right unless

1759.08 --> 1764.779
you really ensure that you're gonna

1762.32 --> 1767.899
forward theories that you can back up

1764.779 --> 1770.059
with evidence and logical

1767.899 --> 1771.26
inquiry

1770.059 --> 1773.48
yeah

1771.26 --> 1776.48
that's the risk

1773.48 --> 1778.279
that's what happens yeah you go to very

1776.48 --> 1779.779
technical people with actual information

1778.279 --> 1781.46
and proof

1779.779 --> 1783.14
and then it might not be super

1781.46 --> 1784.279
interesting it might be a bummer here

1783.14 --> 1786.26
and there because there's a lot of

1784.279 --> 1788.36
dreams that are going to be dispelled or

1786.26 --> 1790.52
you can go over to the blabber Mouse

1788.36 --> 1792.86
where it's always party time it's like

1790.52 --> 1794.84
this open Cafe and oh there's all these

1792.86 --> 1796.76
stories around the campfire yeah you

1794.84 --> 1799.22
could go to that too you're gonna oh

1796.76 --> 1801.26
it's so great it's so fun

1799.22 --> 1804.6200000000001
you're not going to be the wiser though

1801.26 --> 1808.1
it's just enjoyment time

1804.62 --> 1810.08
and crazy stories it's very unlikely

1808.1 --> 1812.48
you're gonna learn how to figure out

1810.08 --> 1816.039
what's real and not quite the opposite

1812.48 --> 1816.039
and I've already proven that

1817.159 --> 1821.24
right for example When I visit Martin

1819.38 --> 1823.94
litke and hey

1821.24 --> 1827.299
I kind of like the guy but he blabbers

1823.94 --> 1830.0
like absolute [ __ ] [ __ ] he just does I

1827.299 --> 1831.32
don't care if he wants to recognize that

1830.0 --> 1834.02
or not

1831.32 --> 1836.48
I don't think it's like hostile intent

1834.02 --> 1839.24
but he is like a blabber to me and he

1836.48 --> 1841.82
just he does weird things he just shows

1839.24 --> 1844.52
images and talks about them like they're

1841.82 --> 1845.84
real when they're obviously

1844.52 --> 1848.84
like

1845.84 --> 1850.6999999999998
painted and [ __ ] and like he should know

1848.84 --> 1852.74
better if he doesn't know better and

1850.7 --> 1854.8400000000001
he's still doing this then like what the

1852.74 --> 1856.82
hell are you doing man you're just like

1854.84 --> 1859.1
randomly throwing [ __ ] you're coming

1856.82 --> 1861.5
across on the screen you literally don't

1859.1 --> 1864.9399999999998
even know what you're presenting then

1861.5 --> 1864.94
right which one is worse

1874.84 --> 1879.34
oh my God they're not coming for me

1880.76 --> 1885.41
I ain't doing nothing wrong

1882.36 --> 1885.4099999999999
[Music]

1885.919 --> 1893.0
right but yeah this fight

1890.179 --> 1895.519
me kind of using Martin Luther as an

1893.0 --> 1897.14
example of blabbers and like he doesn't

1895.519 --> 1899.84
know what the [ __ ] he's talking about I

1897.14 --> 1901.7
still like him and I still really

1899.84 --> 1904.279
appreciate

1901.7 --> 1906.44
while him also being a friend to me like

1904.279 --> 1910.34
he is a good friend

1906.44 --> 1911.779
he is he is a good guy just seems like

1910.34 --> 1914.62
he doesn't know what the [ __ ] he's doing

1911.779 --> 1914.62
most of the time

1914.659 --> 1918.0800000000002
uh

1916.82 --> 1920.48
so

1918.08 --> 1922.8799999999999
yeah I hope you don't take that too

1920.48 --> 1925.48
harshly Martin I do really appreciate

1922.88 --> 1925.48
you uh

1927.919 --> 1933.679
as you've been also very inspiring to me

1930.86 --> 1935.4189999999999
part partially part of my inspiration of

1933.679 --> 1938.98
leaving like getting on the seat and

1935.419 --> 1938.98
I'll never forget that right

1939.74 --> 1945.3990000000001
but I have to point out things that I

1943.76 --> 1947.84
see

1945.399 --> 1951.9399999999998
especially if I think that they're like

1947.84 --> 1951.9399999999998
detrimental because I care

1952.7 --> 1955.6000000000001
anyways

1959.36 --> 1962.799
hey Terror 306

1968.419 --> 1974.659
he claims ether is real

1970.94 --> 1978.919
this is okay right so he's one of the

1974.659 --> 1981.2600000000002
weirdo Ken wheeler wizard Club then

1978.919 --> 1984.3200000000002
I mean if they're talking about ether

1981.26 --> 1986.0
that means that like it has to be at

1984.32 --> 1987.86
this point they have to be freaking

1986.0 --> 1990.26
connected again really because he's been

1987.86 --> 1993.32
like the primary

1990.26 --> 1995.419
wizard doing that out there for a long

1993.32 --> 2000.72
time

1995.419 --> 2000.72
he had a grip on the aberration

2001.0 --> 2005.039
quite some time ago already

2007.12 --> 2012.6399999999999
Martin is a good F year what has weird

2010.419 --> 2015.7
idea yeah no [ __ ]

2012.64 --> 2018.48
he's just completely scatterbrain at the

2015.7 --> 2018.48
idea is completely

2020.5 --> 2026.38
right but at least he's always like

2023.5 --> 2029.1
doing his best to stay to do good so

2026.38 --> 2029.1000000000001
that's good enough

2037.84 --> 2043.55
and the audience provide range vests

2041.98 --> 2045.46
yeah no [ __ ]

2043.55 --> 2047.799
[Music]

2045.46 --> 2050.26
it's just a savonia breeding ground

2047.799 --> 2052.469
there all of the his followers all

2050.26 --> 2055.6690000000003
become savanyas all of them

2052.469 --> 2055.669
[Music]

2057.04 --> 2060.22
because you're defending something you

2058.78 --> 2064.44
can't prove

2060.22 --> 2064.4399999999996
you just wanted you just trying

2081.76 --> 2088.0600000000004
how flat earther to do is look at them

2083.919 --> 2090.339
and laugh well not all of them tear it

2088.06 --> 2094.74
I don't know if you know but I don't

2090.339 --> 2094.74
think we're like outnumbering them

2095.619 --> 2101.4
I mean there is a lot of discus there's

2098.2 --> 2101.3999999999996
a lot of ethereans

2102.04 --> 2109.06
right

2103.839 --> 2112.98
even to dielectrics boba tea style so

2109.06 --> 2112.98
I don't think we're in the majority

2113.8 --> 2119.26
I mean I think that like our side's

2116.56 --> 2121.7799999999997
percentage here is growing gradually but

2119.26 --> 2124.42
we've been kind of outnumbered for a

2121.78 --> 2126.579
while don't know when the Tide's gonna

2124.42 --> 2130.359
truly turn like that

2126.579 --> 2133.7200000000003
it might take some more time but

2130.359 --> 2136.119
we are like the spirit of the flatter of

2133.72 --> 2138.2799999999997
debate and all that it is still growing

2136.119 --> 2141.46
better it is still refining there's

2138.28 --> 2143.5
still more development

2141.46 --> 2145.66
more insights to come

2143.5 --> 2148.9
so I am kind of confident on the long

2145.66 --> 2152.5
run that we will overtake it all we will

2148.9 --> 2154.839
make people realize what's going on flat

2152.5 --> 2156.7
earthers and make them basically step

2154.839 --> 2160.56
away

2156.7 --> 2160.56
from the ethereum nonsense

2169.54 --> 2175.68
uh really

2171.64 --> 2175.68
pretend to not have heard their names

2193.96 --> 2199.48
we've had to our game leaving abolish

2197.26 --> 2202.92
behind what

2199.48 --> 2202.92
in general yeah

2209.32 --> 2214.44
well leaving them behind you can't

2211.66 --> 2214.44
really be

2216.099 --> 2222.2400000000002
Guided by them anymore because they just

2219.22 --> 2222.24
don't understand things

2223.06 --> 2228.46
like they don't see what is real what is

2226.119 --> 2232.56
not and therefore they have like a

2228.46 --> 2232.56
deranged prioritization system

2234.339 --> 2239.859
that's like the most typical thing about

2236.92 --> 2241.48
Ballers is they they have a uniform way

2239.859 --> 2243.7599999999998
of thinking because of what they believe

2241.48 --> 2248.98
in it just works in a very specific way

2243.76 --> 2251.619
very cohesive but it is incorrect though

2248.98 --> 2254.26
right now flat earthers don't really

2251.619 --> 2255.579
have that luxury because we're all much

2254.26 --> 2258.46
Freer

2255.579 --> 2260.7400000000002
when you're like really smart or not

2258.46 --> 2263.26
and people like really pick their own

2260.74 --> 2265.66
battles internally

2263.26 --> 2268.3
and philosophically within what is

2265.66 --> 2270.64
available and so flat earthers tend to

2268.3 --> 2273.04
like disagree about a whole bunch of

2270.64 --> 2274.54
things every single time you meet one

2273.04 --> 2277.0
there's always something you disagree

2274.54 --> 2279.24
about right Ballers don't have that

2277.0 --> 2279.24
problem

2281.38 --> 2286.3
I mean Ballers even allow themselves

2283.599 --> 2289.7200000000003
within heliocentric thinking to be

2286.3 --> 2293.5
corrected much easier than flat earthers

2289.72 --> 2294.7799999999997
can be persuaded about like a concept

2293.5 --> 2297.46
that they're

2294.78 --> 2299.26
defending or fighting against

2297.46 --> 2301.53
it's a very different

2299.26 --> 2304.76
internal way of going about

2301.53 --> 2304.76
[Music]

2307.62 --> 2316.6189999999997
[Music]

2320.5 --> 2324.46
apologies bring back arguments where

2322.599 --> 2327.6600000000003
it's well if they're facing Flat Earth

2324.46 --> 2327.66
there's Terror 306

2328.66 --> 2332.859
but that's very specific now we are

2330.82 --> 2335.079
talking specifically about Ballers

2332.859 --> 2337.0
facing flat earther

2335.079 --> 2339.52
flat earthers that's not what I was

2337.0 --> 2342.4
talking I was talking about how they do

2339.52 --> 2344.619
things internally among one another

2342.4 --> 2348.04
like the social rules and how it just

2344.619 --> 2350.619
works how your idea forming works

2348.04 --> 2352.7799999999997
versus flatter there's among one another

2350.619 --> 2354.52
when Ballers face flat earthers that's

2352.78 --> 2357.96
completely different

2354.52 --> 2357.96
it's completely different

2362.68 --> 2367.06
yeah of course they they do what they do

2365.14 --> 2369.52
they scatter gun

2367.06 --> 2372.54
forget about things and then just start

2369.52 --> 2372.54
over and it's like

2372.88 --> 2377.94
machine gunning us with blanks right

2379.72 --> 2386.02
and we were just standing there like

2382.14 --> 2388.359
like it's not doing anything here

2386.02 --> 2390.64
but you can't hear anything though

2388.359 --> 2393.22
because it's still making a lot of noise

2390.64 --> 2396.18
and it looks really dramatic

2393.22 --> 2396.18
ah

2397.0 --> 2404.079
we're just like uh yeah I mean

2401.2 --> 2407.3799999999997
can barely feel anything from that

2404.079 --> 2409.8
but yeah it's making a lot of noise

2407.38 --> 2409.8
right

2411.579 --> 2415.98
I think that is a pretty decent metaphor

2432.7 --> 2438.0989999999997
um nobody's talking about RV

2435.52 --> 2441.04
Terry 306

2438.099 --> 2445.619
literally where where did it say no

2441.04 --> 2445.619
nowhere you literally now bring it up

2459.819 --> 2464.8
and yeah RV calls everybody a fake flat

2463.359 --> 2467.0789999999997
earther

2464.8 --> 2470.8590000000004
it's like if he doesn't call you a fake

2467.079 --> 2472.9
flutter they need you need to be worried

2470.859 --> 2474.64
because that means he kind of wants

2472.9 --> 2476.7400000000002
something from you that's more dangerous

2474.64 --> 2478.54
than when he just calls you a fake flat

2476.74 --> 2480.22
earther because he calls everybody a

2478.54 --> 2482.88
fake flat earther to his own political

2480.22 --> 2482.8799999999997
convenience

2499.119 --> 2505.9
yeah nobody hired you RV nobody hired

2502.599 --> 2508.02
you to be a freaking truth police yeah a

2505.9 --> 2511.3
police officer

2508.02 --> 2512.74
works for the community

2511.3 --> 2517.8590000000004
yeah

2512.74 --> 2517.859
or the community they are policing

2518.02 --> 2523.78
they're paying the police officer in the

2521.319 --> 2524.859
department through the government to do

2523.78 --> 2528.88
that

2524.859 --> 2531.5789999999997
yeah our nobody here a hired RV oh

2528.88 --> 2537.119
please RV please correct me how I'm

2531.579 --> 2540.099
incorrect oh no no you're not a police

2537.119 --> 2542.92
officer okay it's not a police off

2540.099 --> 2547.1800000000003
nobody hired you to do that to them

2542.92 --> 2549.46
yeah nobody wants your protection from

2547.18 --> 2555.0
lies RV

2549.46 --> 2555.0
you're crooked you're a crooked fake cop

2556.96 --> 2561.28
and which is kind of bizarre because if

2559.599 --> 2564.819
you're fake up you can't be a crooked

2561.28 --> 2566.7400000000002
cop but he is nonetheless a crooked fake

2564.819 --> 2568.7799999999997
cop which is kind of paradoxical but

2566.74 --> 2571.56
that's what he is and nobody is paying

2568.78 --> 2571.5600000000004
him to do that

2576.46 --> 2582.04
foreign

2577.44 --> 2584.92
I mean his fans are not paying him to do

2582.04 --> 2588.599
that to them

2584.92 --> 2588.599
so it's not a police officer

2589.85 --> 2592.9
[Music]

2599.38 --> 2601.92
right

2603.88 --> 2608.1400000000003
it's more like a local Town bully and

2606.099 --> 2612.099
everybody's like oh yeah

2608.14 --> 2614.6189999999997
give RV wow we we need to send them into

2612.099 --> 2617.319
that other town so we can make a Ruckus

2614.619 --> 2619.7200000000003
and and we'll be like the big guys your

2617.319 --> 2622.859
go RV it's more like that he's not a

2619.72 --> 2622.859
freaking police officer

2624.64 --> 2627.18
anyway

2636.819 --> 2643.3
anything else want me to blabber more

2640.48 --> 2645.7
rumors and [ __ ] descriptions about other

2643.3 --> 2647.98
people on the Internet is that it is

2645.7 --> 2650.68
that going to be the extent of inquiry

2647.98 --> 2652.96
to my intellect

2650.68 --> 2656.339
is that when I'm gonna use my endless

2652.96 --> 2656.339
daily potential for

2679.06 --> 2685.14

I mean your lack of presence in it my in

2819.52 --> 2826.54
my chat is my failure do you understand

2824.02 --> 2830.079
it means apparently it's not important

2826.54 --> 2833.2599999999998
enough and you'll just sit around not

2830.079 --> 2835.92
even looking at anything

2833.26 --> 2840.7200000000003
and just have the chat be silent for

2835.92 --> 2840.7200000000003
five [ __ ] minutes guys

that's not what my show is

2942.88 --> 2946.78
yeah

2944.02 --> 2949.44
this is a workshop you have to get

2946.78 --> 2949.44
involved

2949.9 --> 2956.2000000000003
if you don't I stop talking

2953.619 --> 2959.98
and then if you still don't get involved

2956.2 --> 2964.14
I end the show and if that continues I

2959.98 --> 2964.14
end the entire show forever

2964.48 --> 2969.7
I don't want to be sitting here

2967.0 --> 2974.52
part of my show every day wasting my

2969.7 --> 2974.52
time because nobody says [ __ ]

2978.64 --> 2983.2799999999997
I'm not sure where to go with

2980.619 --> 2983.28
conversation

2983.74 --> 2987.72
but aren't you thinking about anything

2994.91 --> 2998.1099999999997
[Music]

3001.95 --> 3005.54
[Music]

3010.16 --> 3015.0
I mean really and by the way this is not

3013.14 --> 3018.359
just this show I think it's just

3015.0 --> 3020.9
everybody like nobody wants to know

3018.359 --> 3020.9
anything

3021.119 --> 3026.76
I don't want to know you guys don't even

3024.0 --> 3028.26
want to know nobody wants to [ __ ]

3026.76 --> 3031.44
know anything

3028.26 --> 3033.3590000000004
you just want to be entertained

3031.44 --> 3035.76
you don't want to know you're not

3033.359 --> 3039.319
curious you're not like on top of

3035.76 --> 3041.94
something really potentially

3039.319 --> 3044.359
world-changing Spirit realm changing

3041.94 --> 3044.359
nothing

3045.18 --> 3053.339
stop listening to blabberwers out there

3049.319 --> 3056.099
taking away your critical thinking and

3053.339 --> 3058.52
do some critical thinking and then come

3056.099 --> 3058.52
to me

3060.0 --> 3067.14
I mean seriously most videos out there

3063.3 --> 3069.8390000000004
are just like they take away your soul

3067.14 --> 3071.7599999999998
and I'm talking about stupid conspiracy

3069.839 --> 3076.44
videos not even the ones that are

3071.76 --> 3078.42
blatantly made to do that most videos

3076.44 --> 3081.66
out there

3078.42 --> 3083.46
oh look at these images oh I'm just

3081.66 --> 3086.46
gonna assert a couple of things that are

3083.46 --> 3089.2200000000003
gonna tint relate your fantasy but not

3086.46 --> 3092.579
actually prove anything oh let's do that

3089.22 --> 3095.0989999999997
again oh yes oh you like this baseless

3092.579 --> 3097.319
assertion idea fantasy well I'm gonna

3095.099 --> 3099.839
make it my thing now if you subscribe to

3097.319 --> 3102.42
me I'll give you my baseless assertion

3099.839 --> 3106.64
fantasy all the time until you start to

3102.42 --> 3106.64
believe it and repeat it like a [ __ ]

3109.38 --> 3114.1800000000003
right because you don't understand it

3111.78 --> 3115.8
you didn't inquire you didn't test it

3114.18 --> 3118.44
you didn't test the one that brought the

3115.8 --> 3120.78
idea forth did you you didn't ask

3118.44 --> 3123.18
anything you just let people grab a

3120.78 --> 3125.3
whole [ __ ] day long and you don't do

3123.18 --> 3130.5
anything

3125.3 --> 3136.1600000000003
inquire ask [ __ ] Christians

3130.5 --> 3139.94
stop being a wussy stop being a pacifist

3136.16 --> 3139.94
non-engagement person

3164.54 --> 3168.2599999999998
test things

3169.14 --> 3177.359
if something is wrong

3171.9 --> 3180.2400000000002
then that prioritizes that you like it

3177.359 --> 3181.74
because you need to correct what is

3180.24 --> 3184.319
wrong

3181.74 --> 3187.9799999999996
now whether that error

3184.319 --> 3189.54
is in what you perceive out there

3187.98 --> 3191.579
you got to figure it out because it

3189.54 --> 3196.319
could also be that you're wrong and

3191.579 --> 3199.02
that's why you got to do it because you

3196.319 --> 3201.96
might be wrong and you need to know you

3199.02 --> 3206.099
need to [ __ ] figure it out by asking

3201.96 --> 3208.8
questions and getting in people's way

3206.099 --> 3212.339
do not let them just believe whatever

3208.8 --> 3213.9
the [ __ ] they want but to test their

3212.339 --> 3219.02
ideas

3213.9 --> 3219.02
and not be a [ __ ] pacifist would say

3234.9 --> 3239.819
I'm not talking about pacifism in the

3237.24 --> 3243.74
sense of like political and violence and

3239.819 --> 3243.74
I'm talking about just your attitude

3243.78 --> 3249.059
sick of it I'm sick of the [ __ ] doing

3247.74 --> 3251.7799999999997
nothing

3249.059 --> 3255.0
oh you're working all day long

3251.78 --> 3257.4
but you use that as an excuse to that oh

3255.0 --> 3259.859
that means you don't have to actually

3257.4 --> 3262.079
inquire anywhere you have you you can't

3259.859 --> 3264.9
just let it go

3262.079 --> 3266.94
because oh but I do all that so I don't

3264.9 --> 3268.2000000000003
have to work on my critical thinking

3266.94 --> 3272.339
anymore

3268.2 --> 3275.22
I could just okay that now

3272.339 --> 3279.2
no

3275.22 --> 3279.2
stop growing you die

3287.16 --> 3293.16
shut some fire up your asses God damn it

3290.94 --> 3296.16
I hate it when you guys [ __ ] keep

3293.16 --> 3299.7
silent for five [ __ ] minutes

3296.16 --> 3304.3999999999996
pisses me off to no end it's an insult

3299.7 --> 3304.3999999999996
to me guys it is a direct insult

3322.559 --> 3329.28
no I don't have snacks for today x 320

3326.579 --> 3331.98
like are you even a real person

3329.28 --> 3333.48
are you just some stupid food bot is the

3331.98 --> 3335.66
only [ __ ] thing that you ever talk

3333.48 --> 3335.66
about

3345.06 --> 3350.5099999999998
[Music]

3353.01 --> 3356.469
[Music]

3365.94 --> 3370.14
the edge of the world's real YouTube

3367.98 --> 3372.48
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

3370.14 --> 3375.359
yeah I've seen video of a huge ice wall

3372.48 --> 3377.7
look see now that's at least something

3375.359 --> 3379.98
it is something that I could do

3377.7 --> 3382.6189999999997
something with see somebody asking a

3379.98 --> 3387.0
question it's so difficult

3382.619 --> 3389.599
so difficult right asking a question

3387.0 --> 3389.599
God

3390.72 --> 3394.74
video of the edge of the world real ice

3393.0 --> 3397.68
wall yeah there I think there is an ice

3394.74 --> 3399.54
wall or there was at least but I don't

3397.68 --> 3401.22
know where that was actually filmed and

3399.54 --> 3403.859
I don't know how long it's stretched on

3401.22 --> 3406.2599999999998
it's not like they didn't a Non-Stop

3403.859 --> 3409.0789999999997
shot of about

3406.26 --> 3410.3390000000004
going by it all they should have that

3409.079 --> 3411.8390000000004
would have been really interesting

3410.339 --> 3413.819
because then we could have got like

3411.839 --> 3417.0589999999997
really gotten the feel as to how big

3413.819 --> 3418.74
that thing is and even a hint that is

3417.059 --> 3419.88
orientation

3418.74 --> 3422.7
right

3419.88 --> 3425.339
so yeah there probably is a huge ice

3422.7 --> 3426.96
wall somewhere I don't know though if it

3425.339 --> 3429.96
is continual

3426.96 --> 3432.96
and I don't know the orientation is it a

3429.96 --> 3437.4
circle surrounding us I kind of doubt it

3432.96 --> 3440.339
is it an island like heliocentrics

3437.4 --> 3443.099
suggest no probably not

3440.339 --> 3446.64
but I think it's just a really big chunk

3443.099 --> 3449.2200000000003
of ice while on top of land

3446.64 --> 3452.2799999999997
but it's actually like

3449.22 --> 3454.2599999999998
a really big continent-sized

3452.28 --> 3457.2200000000003
piece of land

3454.26 --> 3457.2200000000003
that's what I think

3466.74 --> 3469.74
mandala

3473.04 --> 3475.94
what is that

3476.64 --> 3480.5
I recognize that word from something

3495.0 --> 3498.319
and mandala

3500.099 --> 3507.299
Mandela is a flat plate that's hilarious

3504.299 --> 3510.299
there should be a mandala effect

3507.299 --> 3513.72
maybe the mandala effect is when

3510.299 --> 3517.22
Ballers realize the Earth is flat

3513.72 --> 3517.22
the mandala effect

3524.16 --> 3528.0
and it's funny too if it's like a plate

3526.14 --> 3530.0989999999997
right because that means it's a disc so

3528.0 --> 3532.799
that is a typical like

3530.099 --> 3534.96
well a lot of Ballers turn into discus

3532.799 --> 3537.359
before they understand that it's

3534.96 --> 3540.7200000000003
probably not that disc

3537.359 --> 3545.72
maybe they are then like mandala

3540.72 --> 3545.72
affected anyway that was funny

3552.42 --> 3555.799
yeah that's right

3558.299 --> 3562.2599999999998
answer your question I did answer your

3561.359 --> 3566.24
question

3562.26 --> 3566.2400000000002
I literally answered your question

3566.94 --> 3570.78
I answer all questions hasn't anybody

3569.46 --> 3573.359
noticed

3570.78 --> 3576.0
hasn't anybody noticed that I actually

3573.359 --> 3578.7
do do that and that is why it pisses me

3576.0 --> 3581.579
off when there's five freaking minute

3578.7 --> 3584.819
silence and nobody's asking anything

3581.579 --> 3588.8390000000004
about just kind of stupid rumors

3584.819 --> 3590.2799999999997
like why who gives a fleeting [ __ ] about

3588.839 --> 3592.859
any of that

3590.28 --> 3595.44
who it's like oh yeah man oh did you

3592.859 --> 3597.54
know like oh the the dumpster yeah

3595.44 --> 3601.079
somebody just put a new trash back there

3597.54 --> 3602.04
it's like why the [ __ ] do you care about

3601.079 --> 3604.38
that

3602.04 --> 3605.64
unless it like really stinks and you

3604.38 --> 3610.94
have to close your window or something

3605.64 --> 3610.94
right why is that a conversation

3611.339 --> 3617.18
ah

3612.839 --> 3617.18
is it not a disc no it's not a disc

3619.38 --> 3626.339
the disk model projection is not the

3623.52 --> 3629.099
scale which means that's not what it

3626.339 --> 3631.44
literally is and that's a undeniable

3629.099 --> 3635.42
fact

3631.44 --> 3635.42
it is however very flat

3643.93 --> 3647.06
[Music]

3664.5 --> 3671.66
it looks like

3666.92 --> 3671.66
30k feet Dome done

3672.119 --> 3678.859
it's just dude check your freaking

3675.96 --> 3678.859
spelling man

3691.64 --> 3700.0789999999997
pretty kid there there is no mention of

3696.299 --> 3702.599
a 30k DOT feet Dome

3700.079 --> 3705.8390000000004
what are you talking about

3702.599 --> 3709.6800000000003
there's no such mention there's a very

3705.839 --> 3711.96
vague vague mention of how airplanes

3709.68 --> 3715.0389999999998
aren't supposed to fly

3711.96 --> 3717.059
after a certain degree which is

3715.039 --> 3719.3390000000004
suggestive that it might be because

3717.059 --> 3721.6800000000003
that's where the Dome

3719.339 --> 3724.859
gets closer to the ground so you might

3721.68 --> 3726.96
fly into it or something that's it

3724.859 --> 3729.0
there's no mention of the word though

3726.96 --> 3731.52
there's no mention of a word accident

3729.0 --> 3737.7
there's not even a reason giving us to

3731.52 --> 3742.38
why it's all suggestion there is no Dome

3737.7 --> 3745.2
no barrier nothing no mention of this no

3742.38 --> 3748.2200000000003
suggestion of this no hidden evidence of

3745.2 --> 3748.22
this nothing

3748.84 --> 3756.859
[Music]

3751.099 --> 3756.8590000000004
all speculation that you want it to be

3760.22 --> 3766.6189999999997
all story suggestion plants all of it

3764.819 --> 3770.08
it's what it is

3766.619 --> 3773.159
you have no evidence nothing

3770.08 --> 3773.159
[Music]

3776.12 --> 3779.27
[Music]

3799.38 --> 3804.42
the homework well that's not literally a

3801.96 --> 3806.4
dome now is it it's just a giant chunk

3804.42 --> 3810.14
of ice

3806.4 --> 3810.14
don't be as smart as George

3817.5 --> 3823.339
bird said extra land but he was amazing

3820.799 --> 3823.339
so

3829.38 --> 3832.55
[Music]

3835.559 --> 3839.579
I mean

3837.0 --> 3843.68
I'm pretty sure he did more than just

3839.579 --> 3843.6800000000003
say there was extra land

3848.7 --> 3855.0
I mean there are

3850.98 --> 3857.76
there is food it's very sparing it but

3855.0 --> 3861.78
like there remember

3857.76 --> 3865.3190000000004
there's potentially even photographs of

3861.78 --> 3866.6400000000003
like Beyond Antarctic of a another piece

3865.319 --> 3869.96
of land there's like potential

3866.64 --> 3869.96
photographs of that it's

3873.24 --> 3877.9199999999996
now whether the details of what Admiral

3876.0 --> 3879.78
Byrd mentioned about what was there is

3877.92 --> 3881.7000000000003
literally there of the or that he was

3879.78 --> 3883.559
like piling it on extra basically his

3881.7 --> 3884.9399999999996
advertisement to encourage everybody we

3883.559 --> 3886.92
got to go there

3884.94 --> 3889.319
that's another matter

3886.92 --> 3890.76
but there is a great likelihood that

3889.319 --> 3895.5589999999997
there is

3890.76 --> 3897.2990000000004
a piece of non-icy dry land surrounded

3895.559 --> 3899.4
by water I don't even know if it's like

3897.299 --> 3903.0
salt or fresh water

3899.4 --> 3907.039
that is there beyond the South Pole

3903.0 --> 3907.039
Beyond Antarctic icecape

3908.46 --> 3913.5
come from all suggestions

3910.799 --> 3916.04
from all sides I mean

3913.5 --> 3919.219
suggestions from all sides so

3916.04 --> 3919.219
[Music]

3925.2 --> 3931.0789999999997
it looked like many kilometers well

3927.359 --> 3933.5989999999997
that's nothing x320 the The Ice wall if

3931.079 --> 3936.96
there is going to be an ice wall there

3933.599 --> 3938.819
even in the rectangular model it's going

3936.96 --> 3941.579
to be

3938.819 --> 3945.5389999999998
like thousands

3941.579 --> 3947.94
it's it's going to be like a very very

3945.539 --> 3950.5200000000004
long freaking ice wall like a thousand

3947.94 --> 3952.799
kilometers or more I don't even know how

3950.52 --> 3955.339
big that will be

3952.799 --> 3955.339
so

3957.66 --> 3961.8799999999997
many cologne yeah a thousand

3964.38 --> 3970.26
at least I don't know exactly how much

3966.78 --> 3971.76
it would be but it's gonna be freaking

3970.26 --> 3975.0200000000004
massive

3971.76 --> 3975.0200000000004
like surreal

3980.88 --> 3986.1800000000003
dude from the grave what are you talking

3983.94 --> 3986.18
about

3987.319 --> 3992.64
investigating that the Dome what though

3990.599 --> 3994.8590000000004
where are you getting this freaking Dome

3992.64 --> 3999.2
from except your physicality assumption

3994.859 --> 3999.2
bias where's this Dome

3999.66 --> 4002.74
this is ridiculous

4003.98 --> 4008.78
why would Flat Earth is go to Antarctica

4006.5 --> 4011.24
to find the Dome

4008.78 --> 4013.039
I guess that if they are Earth discus

4011.24 --> 4015.74
then they wouldn't have to find that

4013.039 --> 4017.8390000000004
Dome now wouldn't they yeah but what if

4015.74 --> 4020.5
it's not there because it's just not a

4017.839 --> 4020.5
freaking Dome

4028.76 --> 4031.2400000000002
right

4036.5 --> 4041.44
this would be interested to see what's

4037.88 --> 4041.44
behind Greenland and more ice

4049.039 --> 4054.429
of course it's interesting but

4051.26 --> 4054.429
[Music]

4054.44 --> 4056.98
so

4058.28 --> 4062.0
so are you saying the container is

4060.26 --> 4064.3590000000004
non-physical no that's not what I'm

4062.0 --> 4064.359
saying

4064.88 --> 4069.559
I'm just saying that

4067.099 --> 4071.6600000000003
oh it could be non-physical it could

4069.559 --> 4073.599
simply be an empty space but that's

4071.66 --> 4075.5589999999997
already threading on

4073.599 --> 4079.6600000000003
conceptual grounds that most people

4075.559 --> 4082.7000000000003
would rather just squirt over instead of

4079.66 --> 4084.319
entertaining that it might be possible

4082.7 --> 4085.3999999999996
so

4084.319 --> 4087.68
yeah

4085.4 --> 4091.4
I think it's much more likely that the

4087.68 --> 4092.8999999999996
container or the orientation of the

4091.4 --> 4095.96
container

4092.9 --> 4100.06
the geometry of it is flat

4095.96 --> 4100.06
not a demise Fair

4113.38 --> 4120.46
lava no

4116.6 --> 4120.46
that's extremely unlikely

4126.739 --> 4132.919999999999
I mean lava is going to actually kind of

4129.5 --> 4136.159
like destroy ice skate right

4132.92 --> 4138.56
yeah because if those things erupt in

4136.159 --> 4140.7789999999995
Smoke clouds they literally that goes

4138.56 --> 4142.819
all that black

4140.779 --> 4146.0
stuff

4142.819 --> 4149.359
swoke falls down on the ice it's going

4146.0 --> 4151.279
to basically start kind of melting it

4149.359 --> 4153.4400000000005
because it's black and it'll absorb a

4151.279 --> 4155.0
lot more sunlight and that will cause it

4153.44 --> 4158.599999999999
to kind of like

4155.0 --> 4160.1
hip over to Melting Point potentially at

4158.6 --> 4162.64
some point right

4160.1 --> 4162.64
so

4164.659 --> 4169.159
yeah lava cools in time but it's also

4167.06 --> 4172.64
very black

4169.159 --> 4176.719
and black stuff on ice

4172.64 --> 4178.52
is like very likely to not make it just

4176.719 --> 4181.659
stay

4178.52 --> 4181.659000000001
ice forever

4182.14 --> 4187.339
it's a rough sketch but

4184.88 --> 4189.679
I it's unlikely that there's going to be

4187.339 --> 4192.44
a volcano like right next to an ice wall

4189.679 --> 4194.54
that's like that's illogical to me

4192.44 --> 4197.139999999999
because the Smoke's just gonna like make

4194.54 --> 4197.14
it break down

4198.92 --> 4204.26
right but who knows what is there I

4202.219 --> 4207.86
don't know you could and literally

4204.26 --> 4209.42
speculate about it none of it will end

4207.86 --> 4213.5199999999995
up to anything

4209.42 --> 4213.52
because it's just speculation

4213.739 --> 4218.36
what could be done there what could be

4215.48 --> 4220.04
done yeah there could be woolly mammoths

4218.36 --> 4221.96
down there there probably are woolly

4220.04 --> 4223.219
mammoths then

4221.96 --> 4225.8
right

4223.219 --> 4228.52
that and it's probably like swarming

4225.8 --> 4228.52
with birds

4229.1 --> 4233.0
I mean

4230.42 --> 4234.86
if it's like really not approached by

4233.0 --> 4236.54
humans and they leave it alone then it's

4234.86 --> 4238.54
probably going to be like this giant

4236.54 --> 4240.92
animal

4238.54 --> 4243.88
reservation where it's just full of

4240.92 --> 4243.88
animals everywhere

4257.12 --> 4263.599999999999
oh shut up Howard now how the [ __ ] do

4259.82 --> 4266.48
you know that oh they do it they lead no

4263.6 --> 4268.820000000001
it all yes Howard oh they're the

4266.48 --> 4271.94
almighty they know everything and

4268.82 --> 4277.099999999999
they're keeping it all a secret from you

4271.94 --> 4280.159
what a good level CIA story mind implant

4277.1 --> 4281.620000000001
slave you are Howard

4280.159 --> 4283.9
yeah

4281.62 --> 4286.58
good good

4283.9 --> 4288.0199999999995
fear your slave masters they know

4286.58 --> 4290.96
everything and they're keeping it a

4288.02 --> 4294.76
secret from you it's exactly what they

4290.96 --> 4294.76
want good good

4310.04 --> 4314.08
hours

4312.08 --> 4316.34
all right

4314.08 --> 4318.86
DBL dip

4316.34 --> 4320.12
DB I'm just going to call you DB

4318.86 --> 4325.719
right

4320.12 --> 4328.64
explain looping right well looping is a

4325.719 --> 4332.02
cosmogonical design concept

4328.64 --> 4335.12
where it is suggested that there is

4332.02 --> 4336.4400000000005
non-linear space situation going on in

4335.12 --> 4339.38
the sense that

4336.44 --> 4341.719
there is no Eternal space

4339.38 --> 4344.659000000001
or this filled up with gas or not like

4341.719 --> 4347.6
there is a finite amount of space but

4344.659 --> 4349.04
how does this space interconnect

4347.6 --> 4353.3
right

4349.04 --> 4354.679
so in certain video games

4353.3 --> 4357.02
yeah that's where I'm gonna start

4354.679 --> 4357.93
comparing it is where the idea also came

4357.02 --> 4359.719
from really

4357.93 --> 4361.400000000001
[Music]

4359.719 --> 4363.9800000000005
there is like

4361.4 --> 4367.159
a screen like Pac-Man

4363.98 --> 4370.4
and like this is the level but you go

4367.159 --> 4373.4
off on the right side you end up on the

4370.4 --> 4377.299999999999
left side of the same level right

4373.4 --> 4380.36
now that's looping

4377.3 --> 4382.64
and it would be inherent to the space in

4380.36 --> 4385.4
this case in the game's case program to

4382.64 --> 4388.52
be that it's programmed to be connected

4385.4 --> 4389.659
this is how this space has been designed

4388.52 --> 4392.120000000001
for

4389.659 --> 4395.659
the simulation

4392.12 --> 4397.76
so that's looping I think that applies

4395.659 --> 4400.82
to the entire realm I think there's a

4397.76 --> 4404.900000000001
distinct loop from east to west

4400.82 --> 4406.94
and like yeah it's all flat but you you

4404.9 --> 4410.239
could go in a straight line and end up

4406.94 --> 4413.299999999999
exactly the same spot every time

4410.239 --> 4415.28
or now let's get a little wonky and

4413.3 --> 4417.679
complicated because yeah what if the

4415.28 --> 4421.58
loop is not a perfect straight line what

4417.679 --> 4425.0
if it is a regular loop it's curved

4421.58 --> 4427.219
like an arc like not a circle but a

4425.0 --> 4428.6
partial Circle where you end up in the

4427.219 --> 4431.179
same spot right

4428.6 --> 4434.120000000001
like if there's a loop how does the

4431.179 --> 4437.3
looping space actually connect

4434.12 --> 4439.76
now there would be a big mystery but it

4437.3 --> 4441.08
can be falsified

4439.76 --> 4446.26
whether

4441.08 --> 4446.26
space is looping or not through tests

4450.8 --> 4455.1990000000005
Sean where's Sean slow mo

4460.159 --> 4462.82
what

4463.1 --> 4467.0
from the greatest [ __ ]

4467.179 --> 4471.1
I don't care whether it's him or not

4471.199 --> 4475.699
it doesn't sound like him I think you

4474.08 --> 4479.0
might be wrong because Sean Hawkins

4475.699 --> 4480.5599999999995
would immediately give his signature

4479.0 --> 4483.38
like

4480.56 --> 4485.26
personal gravel out he does that he's

4483.38 --> 4489.46
completely neurotic

4485.26 --> 4489.46
Howard doesn't or what is it

4494.84 --> 4497.9800000000005
what are you talking about

4499.699 --> 4504.339999999999
from the grave yeah I don't think he is

4505.46 --> 4509.6
right see

4507.199 --> 4512.0
now Sean would never say that about

4509.6 --> 4514.6990000000005
himself even undercover because Sean is

4512.0 --> 4517.94
very bad at being Undercover

4514.699 --> 4521.599999999999
right each Sean can only do Sean

4517.94 --> 4524.659
so from the grave is definitely not Sean

4521.6 --> 4527.3
I know this for certain

4524.659 --> 4529.599999999999
he's already proven he isn't right right

4527.3 --> 4529.6
there

4541.64 --> 4545.96
Howard needs to lay off binge watching

4543.98 --> 4548.5599999999995
Netflix

4545.96 --> 4552.199
uh

4548.56 --> 4555.080000000001
time traveler said no that's not what I

4552.199 --> 4558.0199999999995
said at all you dumbass

4555.08 --> 4561.38
stop putting ridiculous ideas in my

4558.02 --> 4564.860000000001
mouth I did not say that

4561.38 --> 4567.26
time traveler [ __ ] off no he's been

4564.86 --> 4571.639999999999
replaced he's been

4567.26 --> 4573.92
used as a concept the smart man

4571.64 --> 4575.900000000001
that just completely crippled and now

4573.92 --> 4578.84
it's a miracle he still lives yeah

4575.9 --> 4581.9
except it is somebody else literally

4578.84 --> 4585.32
another person another person born

4581.9 --> 4587.78
separately not Stephen Hawkins not even

4585.32 --> 4591.32
studied like Stephen Hawkins

4587.78 --> 4593.0599999999995
different dental records same physical

4591.32 --> 4594.62
issue though

4593.06 --> 4597.320000000001
probably

4594.62 --> 4600.5599999999995
like he's an actor he's an actor playing

4597.32 --> 4602.96
Stephen Hawkins that's already died

4600.56 --> 4605.2390000000005
it's playing him because he's such a

4602.96 --> 4607.6
smart special boy

4605.239 --> 4610.759999999999
and oh look and now is he championing

4607.6 --> 4612.8
heliocentris [ __ ] atheism even more

4610.76 --> 4615.04
even though kind of in the 90s he tried

4612.8 --> 4618.92
to kind of avoid that he was all about

4615.04 --> 4622.64
structure and math very purist yeah he

4618.92 --> 4625.82
didn't entertain [ __ ] iliocentric

4622.64 --> 4629.6
cultist programming yeah that's what the

4625.82 --> 4632.0
new Stephen Hawkins did

4629.6 --> 4635.179
who wasn't even Stephen Hawking just a

4632.0 --> 4637.64
freaking puppet in a wheelchair

4635.179 --> 4640.82
like he didn't even write the script

4637.64 --> 4643.34
it's just a guy getting run around in a

4640.82 --> 4644.54
wheelchair that's it he doesn't do the

4643.34 --> 4647.659000000001
talking

4644.54 --> 4649.82
it's somebody else he just has a staff

4647.659 --> 4651.92
that just programs what he's gonna say

4649.82 --> 4654.44
with Scripts

4651.92 --> 4657.26
it's a total Act

4654.44 --> 4659.178999999999
was I don't know the the fake Stephen

4657.26 --> 4662.06
Hawkins also die I don't know I don't

4659.179 --> 4664.82
care it's fake it's not a freaking time

4662.06 --> 4666.860000000001

4664.82 --> 4669.94
a used like an act

that's what it is

[ __ ] little [ __ ] Mr grimdale

4742.04 --> 4745.46
yes you

4743.659 --> 4749.92
can't

4745.46 --> 4752.96
not my conspiracy theory it's

4749.92 --> 4756.7390000000005
demonstrable fact yet [ __ ] different

4752.96 --> 4759.9800000000005

4756.739 --> 4762.199
it's not the same [ __ ] person

[Music]

4775.49 --> 4779.3
[Music]

4777.62 --> 4781.64
talked about

4779.3 --> 4784.6990000000005
time travel oh that makes him a time

4781.64 --> 4787.219
frail no that makes him Einstein and

4784.699 --> 4790.46
older Howard

4787.219 --> 4792.38
yeah when you talk about time travel it

4790.46 --> 4795.219
doesn't make you a time traveler it

4792.38 --> 4798.64
makes you a Einstein

4795.219 --> 4802.54
pseudoromonian four space fantasist

4798.64 --> 4802.54
that's what he did

4803.3 --> 4809.3
you understand you dumbass

4806.84 --> 4811.82
talking about time traveling doesn't

4809.3 --> 4815.38
make you a [ __ ] time traveler you

4811.82 --> 4815.38
numpty [ __ ]

4819.199 --> 4821.86
right

4836.0 --> 4842.739
surely demonstrable fact should be

4838.76 --> 4842.7390000000005
demonstrable yeah that's right

4870.32 --> 4877.28
let's start on the sealed argument

4873.82 --> 4879.799999999999
no what SEALs what are you talking about

4877.28 --> 4883.0
sealed

4879.8 --> 4883.0
there is containment

4884.719 --> 4889.34
a seal would suggest that there is more

4887.48 --> 4893.5599999999995
room there is absolutely no evidence

4889.34 --> 4893.56
that there even should be more room

4894.02 --> 4896.1990000000005
foreign

4898.719 --> 4904.52
space do you understand

4901.84 --> 4908.6
endless volume

4904.52 --> 4914.6
is a Fantastical concept that cannot

4908.6 --> 4917.84
exist it can not exist

4914.6 --> 4921.8
physically impossible you understand

4917.84 --> 4925.28
it's physically impossible endless space

4921.8 --> 4932.139
cannot exist amount of volume available

4925.28 --> 4932.139
in physical reality must be finite

4944.179 --> 4948.679
yeah and I know that's the first thing

4946.639 --> 4952.88
that heliocentrics

4948.679 --> 4955.84
ruined for everybody because now oh oh

4952.88 --> 4958.9400000000005
yeah oh there's always more room

4955.84 --> 4960.92
literally in the stories in the Sci-Fi

4958.94 --> 4963.5599999999995
it's always more space always more space

4960.92 --> 4965.2390000000005
Oh yeah so you're literally spiritually

4963.56 --> 4967.88
spoiled

4965.239 --> 4970.9
with a physicality assumption bias

4967.88 --> 4975.1990000000005
towards the irrational illogical

4970.9 --> 4976.28
position that there should be endless

4975.199 --> 4979.879999999999
space

4976.28 --> 4981.62
which there isn't

4979.88 --> 4984.679
you understand

4981.62 --> 4987.739
this is a hard one this is like

4984.679 --> 4990.32
pretty much the most painful part of

4987.739 --> 4992.299999999999
physicality assumption bias that you're

4990.32 --> 4994.179
gonna have to overcome

4992.3 --> 4997.900000000001
when you realize

4994.179 --> 4997.9
iliocentrism is fiction

shut up Howard I'm gonna time you out if

5037.96 --> 5042.34
you don't stop blabbering about this

5039.88 --> 5045.219
[ __ ] idea of yours

5042.34 --> 5048.58
you need to stop reading sci-fi science

5045.219 --> 5050.86
fiction books written by atheists Albert

5048.58 --> 5052.96
this is a really dumb childish idea of

5050.86 --> 5055.739
yours

5052.96 --> 5055.7390000000005
uh

5056.739 --> 5061.919999999999
unless you're trying to be funny ha ha

5059.56 --> 5061.92
ha

5082.12 --> 5086.98
is that meant to be an argument yeah

5084.46 --> 5090.34
yeah it is logical conclusion

5086.98 --> 5094.718999999999
huh an A logical conclusion unless you

5090.34 --> 5099.360000000001
also want to argue that yeah of course

5094.719 --> 5102.52
jet fuel melts steel beams in building

5099.36 --> 5106.0
specifically designed and insured

5102.52 --> 5107.1
to survive impacts of airplanes yeah

5106.0 --> 5110.98
yeah yeah yeah

5107.1 --> 5114.52
there's a conclusion there yeah like it

5110.98 --> 5117.94
never happens ever it didn't happen it

5114.52 --> 5122.1990000000005
can't happen that's called logic yeah

5117.94 --> 5125.799999999999
people with ALS don't live that long

5122.199 --> 5129.099999999999
it's impossible there's like literal

5125.8 --> 5130.179
biological study to each phase of how

5129.1 --> 5134.159000000001
that works

5130.179 --> 5138.52
did we get any feedback data about that

5134.159 --> 5141.46
about uh Stephen Hawkins oh no oh yeah

5138.52 --> 5143.02
just oh yeah it's so magical it's so

5141.46 --> 5144.76
special don't talk about it because it

5143.02 --> 5146.679
makes no [ __ ] sense that he lives

5144.76 --> 5148.0
this long because it's not him oh yeah

5146.679 --> 5150.219
and dental records they're kind of

5148.0 --> 5152.92
different you know he's like the

5150.219 --> 5157.06
Hallmark identification for a person

5152.92 --> 5160.92
even Beyond Death yeah

5157.06 --> 5163.0
then jaw their teeth yeah

5160.92 --> 5163.9
identification even if they're just

5163.0 --> 5166.12
bones

5163.9 --> 5170.82
that's how you do it yeah that's how you

5166.12 --> 5170.82
[ __ ] recognize a person you idiot

5176.29 --> 5180.5199999999995
[Music]

5177.639 --> 5183.34
yeah you don't even have to see the

5180.52 --> 5188.080000000001
[ __ ] records to know it you can

5183.34 --> 5191.860000000001
literally look at his freaking face his

5188.08 --> 5194.8
face is different his jaw is different

5191.86 --> 5196.78
his teeth are in different positions you

5194.8 --> 5200.04
[ __ ] idiot

5196.78 --> 5203.639
it's different it's not the same person

5200.04 --> 5203.639
different person

5203.739 --> 5210.459999999999
you can see it just photo 90s photo

5208.48 --> 5215.138999999999
21st century

5210.46 --> 5217.179
there you go it doesn't match yeah no

5215.139 --> 5219.9400000000005
[ __ ] it doesn't match because it's not

5217.179 --> 5222.639
the same person you dumbass or you think

5219.94 --> 5226.08
anybody that wears glasses look alike

5222.639 --> 5226.08
are you one of those guys

5227.38 --> 5236.08
and let no you [ __ ] wit

5231.76 --> 5238.92
it's not the same person you [ __ ]

5236.08 --> 5238.92
idiot

5242.32 --> 5250.299999999999
different teeth different job not the

5246.639 --> 5253.679
way it's set like on his face it's

5250.3 --> 5253.679
literally different

5257.639 --> 5265.06
it's not the guy it's not him

5262.659 --> 5267.28
I mean this guy probably doesn't even

5265.06 --> 5270.400000000001
know anything about math

5267.28 --> 5274.54
just a guy with ALS that kind of looked

5270.4 --> 5276.699
alike and just use him as an actor he

5274.54 --> 5278.26
doesn't have to write the scripts he

5276.699 --> 5280.54
doesn't even have to move his freaking

5278.26 --> 5283.38
face and he does it

5280.54 --> 5286.54
when he's supposedly doing there

5283.38 --> 5288.9400000000005
he's just [ __ ] bored he's just

5286.54 --> 5293.0199999999995
sitting there bored

5288.94 --> 5295.0599999999995
he's not focused on anything it's not

5293.02 --> 5298.360000000001
the guy

5295.06 --> 5302.9800000000005
he's just a puppet sitting there

5298.36 --> 5306.36
well a script writing team is making his

5302.98 --> 5312.36
voice box say [ __ ] he is not even

5306.36 --> 5312.36
involved when that happens you idiot

5316.719 --> 5321.82
you know he does yeah I know he died

5318.699 --> 5324.46
yeah I know I mentioned it already it's

5321.82 --> 5328.179
not him you hear me you [ __ ] [ __ ]

5324.46 --> 5330.34
it's not him it wasn't him it's another

5328.179 --> 5333.12
person and if you believe that was the

5330.34 --> 5336.76
actual Stephen Hawkins you're a [ __ ]

5333.12 --> 5339.04
[ __ ] you're a [ __ ] you have no

5336.76 --> 5340.96
critical thinking you have no sensory

5339.04 --> 5343.659
abilities left

5340.96 --> 5346.84
you've turned yourself into a deranged

5343.659 --> 5349.48
delusional [ __ ] with logical conclusion

5346.84 --> 5352.179
and you don't deserve that name you hear

5349.48 --> 5354.4
me you don't deserve your name

5352.179 --> 5356.92
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] if you believe

5354.4 --> 5359.339999999999
that's actually Stephen Hawkins you're a

5356.92 --> 5359.34
[ __ ]

5362.82 --> 5366.34
[Music]

5368.8 --> 5371.6990000000005
that's right there

5372.52 --> 5379.360000000001
no no it's not funny you're a [ __ ]

5375.94 --> 5381.699
[ __ ] logical conclusion you're a [ __ ]

5379.36 --> 5384.5199999999995
I bet you think Helen Keller was a real

5381.699 --> 5385.9
person too right was actually deaf and

5384.52 --> 5388.92
blind even though she had a freaking

5385.9 --> 5388.92
British accent

5389.679 --> 5395.92
are you one of those morons it's just oh

5391.96 --> 5398.56
but it's a special boy it's an icon was

5395.92 --> 5402.58
put in a pedestal I don't want that to

5398.56 --> 5405.659000000001
be taken away because I'm a [ __ ] and I

5402.58 --> 5409.0599999999995
believe demonstrably

5405.659 --> 5412.12
disprovable situations where the people

5409.06 --> 5412.96
are obviously not as they are shown to

5412.12 --> 5414.94
be

5412.96 --> 5417.28
you don't have critical thinking

5414.94 --> 5419.62
abilities left do you you just don't

5417.28 --> 5421.84
want to let go of that [ __ ] [ __ ]

5419.62 --> 5424.78
dream that they make you believe and

5421.84 --> 5427.06
shove it in your face

5424.78 --> 5428.92
and then peer pressure [ __ ] with it as

5427.06 --> 5431.5
well like how dare you question it yeah

5428.92 --> 5434.4400000000005
are you that weak are you that cocked

5431.5 --> 5438.28
logical conclusion you believe any

5434.44 --> 5440.82
shitty old story they shove in your face

5438.28 --> 5440.82
huh

5449.98 --> 5452.5199999999995
ah

5462.52 --> 5466.780000000001
definitely a little bit more pissed off

5465.219 --> 5469.12
today

5466.78 --> 5470.739
but yeah I think it was silence it's

5469.12 --> 5475.0
just like dude

5470.739 --> 5476.199
at least people are talking in chat

5475.0 --> 5478.0
huh

5476.199 --> 5481.48
that's better I guess I'll just have to

5478.0 --> 5485.02
get pissed off and curse you out

5481.48 --> 5486.82
for your weakness and sloth whenever

5485.02 --> 5489.42
that happens because at least now things

5486.82 --> 5489.42
are moving

5504.28 --> 5510.5199999999995
you want me no no

5506.56 --> 5513.639
just ban you logical conclusion yeah

5510.52 --> 5516.040000000001
nonsense right I'm gonna ban you get the

5513.639 --> 5520.3
[ __ ] out of here I can't believe you

5516.04 --> 5522.639
even hung around this long what a [ __ ]

5520.3 --> 5525.639
you're not worthy to be in my chat

5522.639 --> 5528.400000000001
anymore yeah back to work that's right

5525.639 --> 5531.34
bye you go back to work

5528.4 --> 5533.32
and believe in [ __ ] stories shoved in

5531.34 --> 5535.6
your face

5533.32 --> 5538.44
yeah

5535.6 --> 5538.4400000000005
don't do that

5539.739 --> 5544.799999999999
yeah the puppet was a real human yes

5542.26 --> 5544.8
Howard

5546.34 --> 5553.2390000000005
God that's a dumbass question

5550.659 --> 5555.46
I already explained everything about it

5553.239 --> 5558.4
but you didn't pay attention did you you

5555.46 --> 5560.62
never pay attention none of you do

5558.4 --> 5564.339999999999
except maybe like

5560.62 --> 5566.739
turret slow-mo

5564.34 --> 5569.38
Jeff

5566.739 --> 5571.718999999999
those guys

5569.38 --> 5574.4400000000005
they actually listen when I do that you

5571.719 --> 5578.08
I you guys all see people go like oh oh

5574.44 --> 5580.0
Arwin is kind of angry that means I'm

5578.08 --> 5582.94
literally going to blank out and not

5580.0 --> 5586.62
hear a word he's saying because we want

5582.94 --> 5586.62
to remain ignorant and dumb

5586.98 --> 5592.0
right it's much easier to just

5590.02 --> 5593.7390000000005
just not hear it so you let everybody

5592.0 --> 5595.54
like what oh I don't know what you're

5593.739 --> 5597.459999999999
talking about because I'm a [ __ ]

5595.54 --> 5601.86
[ __ ] that never pays attention when

5597.46 --> 5601.86
something is yelled to their face

5604.719 --> 5608.159
like a kumu virus here

5618.58 --> 5621.179
foreign

5625.36 --> 5629.799999999999
there would definitely pays attention

5628.179 --> 5632.08
but

5629.8 --> 5633.88
it gets a little distracted sometimes

5632.08 --> 5636.88
and a little caught up in his own

5633.88 --> 5638.9800000000005
passion so

5636.88 --> 5641.219
but he's a pretty young guy and he's

5638.98 --> 5641.218999999999
Indian

5643.48 --> 5648.339999999999
just how it works

5645.42 --> 5649.659
he's actually given me a lot of input

5648.34 --> 5652.900000000001
overall

5649.659 --> 5654.759999999999
and he's a pretty sharp fellow so yeah

5652.9 --> 5657.58
don't

5654.76 --> 5660.6
don't come in my chat saying [ __ ] like

5657.58 --> 5660.6
that thank you very much

5663.04 --> 5668.38
that time to walk in no Kuma virus is

5665.739 --> 5671.86

or are you actually gonna join the

5682.54 --> 5685.619
Discord for a change

5687.76 --> 5694.92
[Music]

5690.82 --> 5694.92
over at fpd huh

5695.139 --> 5698.219

I don't know if the real yeah he is dead

5725.86 --> 5729.42
Howard he is dead

5734.38 --> 5739.119
stuck in the no no

5737.619 --> 5741.58
dumbass

5739.119 --> 5744.78
stop fantasizing about physical time

5741.58 --> 5744.78
travel it doesn't exist

5746.56 --> 5752.860000000001
it's entirely derived from a conceptual

5750.28 --> 5756.699
medium that was never proven never even

5752.86 --> 5758.199
suggested to be able to be proven it

5756.699 --> 5760.0599999999995
doesn't exist

5758.199 --> 5763.839999999999
all right there's no physical time

5760.06 --> 5766.84
travel there is spiritual time travel

5763.84 --> 5769.5
it's really complicated enough as it is

5766.84 --> 5769.5
all right

5771.1 --> 5775.659000000001
Stephen Hawkins is dead

5773.86 --> 5777.88
the real one

5775.659 --> 5781.799999999999
he took his Brilliance with him because

5777.88 --> 5781.8
he was still very promising

5797.199 --> 5801.28
yeah

5798.36 --> 5804.099999999999
it is dumbass Howard

5801.28 --> 5806.32
I mean I can I can change that you being

5804.1 --> 5807.46
here I can easily change that if you're

5806.32 --> 5810.9
just gonna be

5807.46 --> 5810.9
more [ __ ]

5818.4 --> 5823.138999999999
okay smart ass Matthew Hall

5828.639 --> 5833.52
oh you said sorry I misread you there

5830.98 --> 5833.5199999999995
how what

5835.78 --> 5839.5
but why would you say it isn't proven

5837.88 --> 5842.4400000000005
yes it is

5839.5 --> 5845.619
I mean it's not scientifically proven

5842.44 --> 5848.739
because we can't really very manipulate

5845.619 --> 5851.619
it we shouldn't it's a what is question

5848.739 --> 5854.699
it's definitely proven

5851.619 --> 5854.699
Black Swan

5854.86 --> 5860.619
The Horizon is not geometric there's no

5857.5 --> 5863.139
earth spin and has to be contained it's

5860.619 --> 5865.0
absolutely proven

5863.139 --> 5868.36
has to be

5865.0 --> 5871.06
and it is it's measured to be flat

5868.36 --> 5873.759999999999
everything about it every single

5871.06 --> 5876.34
measurement all indicates flatness

5873.76 --> 5879.159000000001
even the entire construction of the

5876.34 --> 5881.92
heliocentric mathematical framework is

5879.159 --> 5884.82
based off a flat plane

5881.92 --> 5884.82
all of it

5885.639 --> 5890.8
you can't have something more proven at

5889.06 --> 5892.360000000001
this point than that the Earth is

5890.8 --> 5894.84
actually flat

5892.36 --> 5899.86
it's the most provable

5894.84 --> 5904.619000000001
demonstrable empirically validated

5899.86 --> 5904.619
what is question that exists

5930.639 --> 5935.26
yeah that's right Matthew ho that's why

5933.04 --> 5937.26
I liked him so much because the real

5935.26 --> 5941.26
Stephen Hawkins

5937.26 --> 5944.08
was an actual nerd and he wasn't like a

5941.26 --> 5946.84
a devil [ __ ] piece of [ __ ]

5944.08 --> 5949.36
he was actually like kind of almost

5946.84 --> 5952.4800000000005
divinely inspired like he

5949.36 --> 5954.82
so serious so pure non-corrupted

5952.48 --> 5956.739
and everybody hated him for it like

5954.82 --> 5958.84
everybody was just envious to work

5956.739 --> 5960.94
everybody like gamma

5958.84 --> 5966.3
like either try to suck up to him in

5960.94 --> 5966.299999999999
some way or like smirk his character

5968.139 --> 5972.219
right

5969.639 --> 5975.179
so that's how you know that's not just a

5972.219 --> 5975.179
a devil puppet

5984.159 --> 5988.379999999999
what the hell were you talking about

5985.84 --> 5988.38
Howard

5990.659 --> 5994.138999999999
incoherent question

5998.62 --> 6001.7699999999995
[Music]

6013.8 --> 6016.400000000001
okay

6022.98 --> 6027.599999999999
I didn't know about that part are you

6025.5 --> 6030.139
talking about the new Stephen Hawkins or

6027.6 --> 6030.139
the old one

6031.08 --> 6036.38
I think the Earth was flat no probably

6033.96 --> 6036.38
not

6039.78 --> 6045.44
but I don't think he was overly invested

6042.36 --> 6050.219
in heliocentrism he the guy was just

6045.44 --> 6052.5599999999995
totally about math like only that stuff

6050.219 --> 6054.06
like he didn't care whether the Earth

6052.56 --> 6055.1990000000005
was flat or a ball

6054.06 --> 6058.080000000001
right

6055.199 --> 6061.678999999999
he didn't care

6058.08 --> 6064.619
that came later after he died and oh

6061.679 --> 6067.1990000000005
look oh now I said the origin of the

6064.619 --> 6069.0
universe or it has to be heliocentric

6067.199 --> 6072.0
programming blah blah blah blah blah

6069.0 --> 6073.56
existential nonsense atheist blabber

6072.0 --> 6076.1
[ __ ]

6073.56 --> 6076.1
yeah

6076.44 --> 6080.82
that's not the old Stephen Hawkins he

6079.139 --> 6085.400000000001
wouldn't do that

6080.82 --> 6085.4
he would not lower himself to that

6085.44 --> 6090.0
yeah to that level because the guy

6087.84 --> 6093.179
really had like this internal strong

6090.0 --> 6096.42
Integrity in what he was doing so the

6093.179 --> 6100.8
new puppet was done to do that it was

6096.42 --> 6102.679
basically a giant backstab they created

6100.8 --> 6106.860000000001
a fake hymn

6102.679 --> 6109.26
to make him after he died

6106.86 --> 6112.82
say the things that he wouldn't say

6109.26 --> 6117.06
while he was alive you see how horrific

6112.82 --> 6120.84
the gravel really is they literally took

6117.06 --> 6123.1990000000005
somebody to make him say the [ __ ] that

6120.84 --> 6127.56
he would never say while he was alive

6123.199 --> 6130.379999999999
they made him do it after he died okay

6127.56 --> 6131.76
that's how much if they [ __ ] hated

6130.38 --> 6134.34
this guy

6131.76 --> 6136.4400000000005
because he wouldn't corrupt

6134.34 --> 6138.96
yeah I have a great respect for the

6136.44 --> 6140.879999999999
original Stephen Hawkins so did my

6138.96 --> 6143.219
brother by the way

6140.88 --> 6146.179
like we were kind of into him

6143.219 --> 6146.179
in the 90s

6154.619 --> 6160.86
right so yeah again all this Taco that's

6158.82 --> 6163.32
it the real Stephen yeah you know it's

6160.86 --> 6166.38
because why am I passionate about that

6163.32 --> 6167.639
because I [ __ ] hate that they did

6166.38 --> 6171.659000000001
that to him

6167.639 --> 6174.78
that they besmirched his pure spirit

6171.659 --> 6178.08
by making another guy

6174.78 --> 6180.3
into him and then making him say all

6178.08 --> 6181.199
those things that he would never ever

6180.3 --> 6182.820000000001
say

6181.199 --> 6185.5199999999995
in real life

6182.82 --> 6188.34
he would never lower himself

6185.52 --> 6191.34
but they did it to him after he died I

6188.34 --> 6194.219
mean how [ __ ] evil

6191.34 --> 6197.82
can he be to a person with a good spirit

6194.219 --> 6200.4
well this is how evil

6197.82 --> 6202.679
shattered to think that maybe one day

6200.4 --> 6205.44
they should do something like that to me

6202.679 --> 6206.82
horrible idea

6205.44 --> 6208.739
horrible

6206.82 --> 6211.44
but likely

6208.739 --> 6213.54
I mean I wouldn't be surprised

6211.44 --> 6216.299999999999
if they ended up doing something like

6213.54 --> 6217.92
that to me literally replace me with

6216.3 --> 6222.96
kind of a look-alike and that just

6217.92 --> 6224.1
became total ravenous evil ravenous

6222.96 --> 6227.219
right

6224.1 --> 6228.900000000001
you'd know I would never do that or

6227.219 --> 6231.96
you'd think this guy has gone completely

6228.9 --> 6232.92
crazy but I would never allow myself to

6231.96 --> 6236.159
do that

6232.92 --> 6238.76
I would rather suffer in silence

6236.159 --> 6238.759999999999
then

6239.699 --> 6246.36
right but anyway let's not draw overly

6244.5 --> 6249.02
dramatic conclusions about what would

6246.36 --> 6249.0199999999995
happen or not

6249.42 --> 6254.219
oh robot or when Global no but that's

6252.119 --> 6256.5
that's useless biscuit box that's

6254.219 --> 6260.52
[ __ ] there's no robot me

6256.5 --> 6262.26
and I'm already a global superhero okay

6260.52 --> 6265.1990000000005
I'm here

6262.26 --> 6269.52
to save your religion

6265.199 --> 6273.119
but with a very distinct

6269.52 --> 6275.040000000001
demand and that is you must admit it's a

6273.119 --> 6278.46
religion you must admit it's not real

6275.04 --> 6282.38
and then I can help you

6278.46 --> 6282.38
save your religion

6282.719 --> 6286.8
I can save the discipline I can save the

6285.54 --> 6291.54
artistry

6286.8 --> 6295.139
I can save the storytelling medium

6291.54 --> 6298.139
but I'm not gonna just give it to you

6295.139 --> 6300.6
while you remain ignorant

6298.139 --> 6301.5
that's not how we are going to be handed

6300.6 --> 6304.139
it

6301.5 --> 6306.6
right so I'm rounding out the show now

6304.139 --> 6308.159000000001
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6306.6 --> 6310.7390000000005

6308.159 --> 6312.54
it started kind of slow then I got

6310.739 --> 6315.0
pissed off and I finally got things

6312.54 --> 6318.48
rolling so maybe I'll just start out

6315.0 --> 6319.619

6322.139 --> 6327.0
what I'm gonna slap you in the face if

6324.719 --> 6330.8
you don't give me a straight look maybe

6327.0 --> 6330.8
I have to start my shows like that

6330.84 --> 6337.56
because I do not

6333.0 --> 6340.38
like and I mean never I never again want

6337.56 --> 6343.02

6353.82 --> 6358.5
