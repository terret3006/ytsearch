but it's just

111.6 --> 115.83999999999999
like a handful of droplets and then

247.2 --> 258.079
i actually watched glow busses

254.0 --> 258.079
was yeah it wasn't that bad

258.56 --> 263.519
it's interesting we're talking about

261.199 --> 263.519
again

263.6 --> 269.84000000000003
this is why i should make notes uh

281.199 --> 284.88
i don't know i can't recall at the

283.36 --> 287.52000000000004
moment maybe if one of you

284.88 --> 287.52
has seen it

288.479 --> 297.28
missed it all right

292.88 --> 300.32
well normally i i don't really watch it

297.28 --> 302.479
because i don't know it's to me it just

300.32 --> 304.24
it's not super interesting it doesn't

302.479 --> 308.32
seem to be focused

304.24 --> 311.84000000000003
on me as a group my interest so much

308.32 --> 311.84
but this time it was kind of interesting

312.08 --> 316.24
but yeah weirdly enough i don't remember

314.0 --> 316.24
why

316.4 --> 319.59999999999997
i have to look through it

321.36 --> 325.84000000000003
mr two everybody missed it but me it was

324.24 --> 329.6
actually kind of good

325.84 --> 329.59999999999997
i was hanging around in the life there

332.4 --> 336.15999999999997
but anyway yeah fun and afterward man i

335.759 --> 339.84000000000003
had

336.16 --> 344.24
another crazy call with rest i had like

339.84 --> 344.23999999999995
he called me up it's very enthusiastic

344.639 --> 347.68
and it was way too late for me and he

346.56 --> 353.84
had all these

347.68 --> 353.84000000000003
pretty good ideas but god

355.44 --> 367.28
hey ordinary bear good to see you and

358.08 --> 369.84
rob h

367.28 --> 369.84
but yeah

379.6 --> 382.639
yeah rust hat was basically sharing that

381.6 --> 385.84000000000003
he might be

382.639 --> 388.8
moving at some point

385.84 --> 388.79999999999995
because of uh

389.68 --> 394.88
yeah because of some things with flat

392.84 --> 396.479
earthers

394.88 --> 398.639
anyway i don't know if i'm supposed to

396.479 --> 401.52
be talking about that openly so i'm not

398.639 --> 405.12
gonna share the details but

401.52 --> 406.96
he might be moving at some point to yeah

405.12 --> 408.96
pretty good location from what i've

406.96 --> 414.31899999999996
heard uh

408.96 --> 417.75899999999996
also yeah he wanted to kind of

414.319 --> 419.84000000000003
he was suggesting i do a show other than

417.759 --> 422.0
flat earth early bird like on top of it

419.84 --> 425.11999999999995
it's not the first time somebody asks

422.0 --> 427.599
me this right and i was still like oh

425.12 --> 431.28000000000003
yeah it does seem like a good idea but i

427.599 --> 434.24
don't know if i have the energy for this

431.28 --> 436.4
i might have at some po at some point i

434.24 --> 439.44
am very active

436.4 --> 442.15999999999997
like as a as a

439.44 --> 444.0
chat character as on the side that works

442.16 --> 445.199
very well i can keep that up very well

444.0 --> 448.4
on a good level

445.199 --> 451.84000000000003
but to actually be part of the show

448.4 --> 451.84
itself that's slightly different

453.84 --> 460.56
so maybe like a weekly thing

457.599 --> 461.039
but it does seem kind of interesting

460.56 --> 463.599
like an

461.039 --> 465.12
option maybe just for temporary to try

463.599 --> 468.0
it out

465.12 --> 468.96
and rastad seems to have a lot of animo

468.0 --> 472.479
a lot of energy

468.96 --> 473.28
time on his hands to do something like

472.479 --> 476.96
that and he

473.28 --> 482.479
yeah he's he's full of ideas anyway

476.96 --> 482.479
so he was like he kind of wants a

484.0 --> 493.84
yeah a conspiracy talk show that's

488.72 --> 493.84000000000003
yeah much raw much more raw and rough

495.68 --> 500.319
and yeah maybe i will join in

498.72 --> 504.16
on something like that i don't know if

500.319 --> 504.16
i'd be running that show myself but

504.879 --> 508.56
i need to fill the evening spot now

507.599 --> 520.56
randy is on

508.56 --> 523.519
a break okay oh god

520.56 --> 526.88
how long a break is he i didn't even did

523.519 --> 526.88
did he have a daily show

527.2 --> 530.6400000000001
i thought it was like just sporadically

529.68 --> 535.8389999999999
i don't know man i

530.64 --> 535.8389999999999
haven't followed him in months so

536.08 --> 539.44
hello by the way adam meekin

542.16 --> 549.8389999999999
brandon toy is taking over okay

552.3 --> 555.3499999999999
[Music]

560.839 --> 563.839
hmm

574.839 --> 577.9200000000001
so

576.08 --> 581.279
you don't watch right here anymore

577.92 --> 581.279
amanda young i didn't know that

587.12 --> 591.839
i thought you really liked this [ __ ] his

588.839 --> 591.839
shows

593.12 --> 605.839
or is it that you're just short on time

596.16 --> 605.8389999999999
these days

606.399 --> 610.16
i wanted randy and sleeping warrior for

608.88 --> 614.079
god

610.16 --> 619.8389999999999
that's you don't know

614.079 --> 619.8389999999999
that's like half a year ago now or more

621.44 --> 625.519
it was because of the whole super chat

623.519 --> 627.6
situation

625.519 --> 628.64
when randy was promising to give it to

627.6 --> 632.72
roxanne and

628.64 --> 637.519
and that just became a huge hassle and

632.72 --> 640.24
tony just latched on to that

637.519 --> 642.32
and ranty just refused basically to take

640.24 --> 643.12
responsibility and that's kind of like a

642.32 --> 648.0790000000001
lawsuit

643.12 --> 648.079
or something like that happening

648.32 --> 653.44
so i yeah that's that's pretty much all

650.72 --> 653.44
i know about it

659.279 --> 665.8389999999999
peachey is ace really

662.56 --> 668.7199999999999
okay george sanford didn't know you were

665.839 --> 668.72
a big fan of him

670.32 --> 676.0
now he's he's kind of okay he's

673.44 --> 676.48
he's can be pretty shitty and he can be

676.0 --> 679.519
nah

676.48 --> 683.04
okay so he's not all bad

679.519 --> 688.64
but yeah he's some really

683.04 --> 690.7199999999999
bad habits

688.64 --> 692.3199999999999
court date is very close now irwin

690.72 --> 694.88
submitted my statement to the court that

692.32 --> 694.88
weekend woo

700.839 --> 704.8000000000001
exciting

702.0 --> 704.8
exciting and

707.04 --> 712.16
and pretty tense i bet ranty must be

710.56 --> 714.7199999999999
feeling it

712.16 --> 717.1999999999999
maybe that is also why he why he just

714.72 --> 721.6
halted the show

717.2 --> 721.6
i don't know i'm just speculating now

728.0 --> 732.72
anyway right so that's still happening

730.0 --> 732.72
in the background

737.839 --> 744.0790000000001
it's been almost three months you got

742.839 --> 747.44
bored

744.079 --> 749.3599999999999
okay amanda young i didn't know

747.44 --> 752.0790000000001
because i don't know it hasn't been that

749.36 --> 754.0
long ago that you were still

752.079 --> 756.8389999999999
basically telling me in chat that you

754.0 --> 759.76
really liked him

756.839 --> 762.1600000000001
so i don't know maybe time has just

759.76 --> 766.16
really flown

762.16 --> 766.16
it kind of has you know since i got

766.56 --> 770.4799999999999
on the other level how do you even call

768.8 --> 774.639
that since i just

770.48 --> 777.04
become became more focused in my show

774.639 --> 778.8
i think that time has flown a lot

777.04 --> 781.04
because to me it's almost like yeah

778.8 --> 782.639
like two weeks ago i really started to

781.04 --> 784.48
get this momentum

782.639 --> 787.04
that's kind of what it is in my mind in

784.48 --> 790.5600000000001
my in my feeling system

787.04 --> 795.279
but when i actually look back no

790.56 --> 798.8
no it's it's been months now months

795.279 --> 798.8
it's like 10 weeks more

798.88 --> 802.88
that i'm i'm doing pretty damn good

803.36 --> 811.279
so i don't know time is flying for me

807.44 --> 811.2790000000001
i guess it flies when you have fun

813.44 --> 819.6800000000001
maybe it's a trick of the mind also

817.04 --> 822.0
the time awareness part because when you

819.68 --> 825.199
are having fun

822.0 --> 827.44
there's no need to emphasize time for

825.199 --> 828.399
your ego because you want to keep it

827.44 --> 831.0400000000001
going

828.399 --> 832.16
so time then kind of passes by on you

831.04 --> 836.16
you don't worry about it

832.16 --> 838.3199999999999
well if you're not having as much fun

836.16 --> 840.24
your ego doesn't like it as much and

838.32 --> 842.639
it's kind of like in the waiting room

840.24 --> 843.279
and then it it's going to point out the

842.639 --> 857.839
time

843.279 --> 857.8389999999999
more so that makes it it's a mechanism

859.92 --> 866.079
your mom said flat earth is untrue

862.959 --> 868.88
did she give any arguments for that

866.079 --> 870.6389999999999
because i don't know most people when

868.88 --> 873.92
they just say

870.639 --> 876.639
it like that it's usually just a fending

873.92 --> 878.7199999999999
it off reflex it usually just means i

876.639 --> 880.9590000000001
don't want to know about it

878.72 --> 882.5600000000001
this is my reflex please don't confront

880.959 --> 884.6389999999999
me with that again that's really what

882.56 --> 886.959
that is usually

884.639 --> 888.72
unless they're like really in love with

886.959 --> 889.76
the globe and then they might forward

888.72 --> 892.32
some arguments

889.76 --> 895.92
to defend that position i don't know if

892.32 --> 895.9200000000001
they did the elf handler

897.519 --> 901.839
oh there okay so she's a uh she fell for

900.56 --> 905.279
it

901.839 --> 908.24
she's a moon landing uh boomer

905.279 --> 910.639
right oh there's nothing much you can do

908.24 --> 910.639
about it

911.04 --> 917.519
except yeah get hard on her

914.48 --> 919.6
you know but she said it it's your mom

917.519 --> 923.44
right

919.6 --> 925.44
right so you might wanna

923.44 --> 926.8000000000001
realize that of course it is your mom

925.44 --> 928.72
and if you're going to go

926.8 --> 929.92
hard at it because it is going to be

928.72 --> 933.6
hard al

929.92 --> 934.0
also with family you know family can be

933.6 --> 937.12
the

934.0 --> 940.639
most difficult to convince

937.12 --> 943.92
it some often impossible even often

940.639 --> 946.5600000000001
it's not it's not

943.92 --> 949.199
a small chat so you got to realize that

946.56 --> 952.399
like do you want to really engage

949.199 --> 955.279
that because they might play

952.399 --> 956.959
dirty because it's when they really love

955.279 --> 960.48
the ball like that

956.959 --> 963.8389999999999
they might start to play dirty

960.48 --> 966.72
declare you insane or even

963.839 --> 968.48
try to manipulate you to force you to to

966.72 --> 969.9200000000001
drop that position so you got to be

968.48 --> 972.5600000000001
careful you know this is your mother in

969.92 --> 972.56
this case so

975.279 --> 978.88
the ballers don't play fair

981.6 --> 988.5600000000001
i really need to believe in flat what

984.72 --> 991.0400000000001
oh oh you're just a troll

988.56 --> 994.4799999999999
because that is not a natural thing to

991.04 --> 994.48
say for any flat earther

994.839 --> 999.519
it's

996.639 --> 999.519
it's ridiculous

1004.959 --> 1008.4799999999999
you know there's a whole bunch of people

1007.279 --> 1009.92
out there

1008.48 --> 1013.9200000000001
that don't believe in flat earth

1009.92 --> 1017.759
including in my family

1013.92 --> 1018.399
you don't need them to believe the flat

1017.759 --> 1021.759
earth

1018.399 --> 1023.68
it's just pleasant if you can share your

1021.759 --> 1027.76
thoughts about it with some people

1023.68 --> 1029.52
sometime that's really more important

1027.76 --> 1031.439
because you're never gonna change their

1029.52 --> 1035.6
minds you know

1031.439 --> 1038.72
it's already pretty tough to transition

1035.6 --> 1039.9189999999999
yourself it's a big step to do that in

1038.72 --> 1043.679
the face of the

1039.919 --> 1045.1200000000001
thick thick layered multi-generational

1043.679 --> 1046.959
mind control

1045.12 --> 1048.319
that has been put in place in order to

1046.959 --> 1050.48
help prevent that

1048.319 --> 1053.6
now if you're gonna go over that

1050.48 --> 1056.24
threshold that's a big leap

1053.6 --> 1058.0
most people are just not gonna do that

1056.24 --> 1060.0
they're gonna be like super stubborn

1058.0 --> 1061.76
meals and no matter how much weight you

1060.0 --> 1064.84
pull

1061.76 --> 1066.4
on them they're just not gonna go there

1064.84 --> 1068.799
so

1066.4 --> 1070.88
it only works if it comes from the

1068.799 --> 1074.16
inside as it were if you're

1070.88 --> 1075.2
if you really want to you can't make

1074.16 --> 1077.28
somebody want to

1075.2 --> 1080.16
it's like trying to make somebody fall

1077.28 --> 1094.6399999999999
in love

1080.16 --> 1097.2
doesn't work

1094.64 --> 1098.4
unless you're going to use magic or

1097.2 --> 1101.3600000000001
something then

1098.4 --> 1101.919
yeah you can oh that's not yet see

1101.36 --> 1104.24
that's it

1101.919 --> 1105.2
make them fall in love you can make so

1104.24 --> 1107.679
you can

1105.2 --> 1109.679
get somebody obsessed with you that's

1107.679 --> 1112.0
not the same thing

1109.679 --> 1113.3600000000001
in love is something different it's very

1112.0 --> 1116.64
similar in many ways

1113.36 --> 1119.36
but yeah

1116.64 --> 1120.24
sexual attraction is not in love now if

1119.36 --> 1122.3999999999999
you don't

1120.24 --> 1124.72
understand that yourself you could

1122.4 --> 1128.48
mistake it

1124.72 --> 1130.72
for love and then think that love spells

1128.48 --> 1132.0
are actually making somebody in love no

1130.72 --> 1134.72
no

1132.0 --> 1134.72
not exactly

1135.2 --> 1142.559
so anyway

1138.64 --> 1145.2800000000002
let's not get the dark arch into this

1142.559 --> 1148.08
that's not my intention but yeah the the

1145.28 --> 1149.76
earth being flat

1148.08 --> 1151.6
there's yeah there's nothing you can do

1149.76 --> 1153.52
if you want to talk about it then you

1151.6 --> 1165.84
have to find your friend circles to talk

1153.52 --> 1165.84
about it

1168.799 --> 1178.559
well the quran default references to the

1171.679 --> 1180.96
old testament so

1178.559 --> 1180.96
you know

1186.24 --> 1194.799
well alf handler we don't know that

1192.16 --> 1196.0800000000002
it it all depends on the the nature of

1194.799 --> 1198.72
the realm

1196.08 --> 1200.48
whether it goes it or it seems to go on

1198.72 --> 1203.919
forever because it's never going to

1200.48 --> 1207.039
literally go on forever there cannot be

1203.919 --> 1210.159
an infinite physical volume

1207.039 --> 1212.1589999999999
in any in any factor whether it be the

1210.159 --> 1214.7990000000002
amount of land whether it be space

1212.159 --> 1217.2
above us there is no infinity in

1214.799 --> 1220.4
physicality

1217.2 --> 1222.24
so but it could be pretty damn big

1220.4 --> 1224.0
much bigger than we've made been made to

1222.24 --> 1228.159
believe

1224.0 --> 1231.679
and there could also be unexpected

1228.159 --> 1233.6000000000001
surreal like elements to

1231.679 --> 1235.8400000000001
the yeah the design of the realm there

1233.6 --> 1238.7199999999998
could be a loop

1235.84 --> 1241.039
which yeah a loop within the very space

1238.72 --> 1243.679
itself

1241.039 --> 1245.6
causing you to be able to basically walk

1243.679 --> 1248.72
in a straight line

1245.6 --> 1251.1999999999998
without going over any curve

1248.72 --> 1252.96
just in a perfect euclidean straight

1251.2 --> 1254.559
line and then end up in the same

1252.96 --> 1257.6000000000001
location

1254.559 --> 1258.6399999999999
back at the same spot and that would

1257.6 --> 1261.6789999999999
indicate

1258.64 --> 1264.3200000000002
looping nature of the realm

1261.679 --> 1265.919
and that could mean yeah that has a huge

1264.32 --> 1267.76
amount of potential

1265.919 --> 1270.7990000000002
implications which i have discussed on

1267.76 --> 1270.799
the show many times

1270.88 --> 1275.6000000000001
like for example spatially

1274.12 --> 1277.799
compartmentalized

1275.6 --> 1279.039
realm segments that are spatially

1277.799 --> 1281.2
compartmentalized

1279.039 --> 1282.8799999999999
you can't reach them because they're

1281.2 --> 1286.0
stuck in their own

1282.88 --> 1286.4
loop segments that are cut off from the

1286.0 --> 1290.08
other

1286.4 --> 1292.4
loop segments yeah anyway let's not make

1290.08 --> 1294.3799999999999
it too complicated

1292.4 --> 1297.2
just yet

1294.38 --> 1299.919
[Music]

1297.2 --> 1301.8400000000001
as for in the concept of an edge and i

1299.919 --> 1305.2
don't know

1301.84 --> 1308.8799999999999
could be but the edge is going to be the

1305.2 --> 1310.4
the a barrier it's going to be the edge

1308.88 --> 1315.2800000000002
of the container not

1310.4 --> 1317.2
an edge into the deep

1315.28 --> 1318.96
and then it turns out it's like a flat

1317.2 --> 1321.44
disc in outer space because that's not

1318.96 --> 1321.44
the case

1321.6 --> 1328.08
there is no infinite amount of room

1324.72 --> 1332.48
surrounding earth that's that's just

1328.08 --> 1347.84
not the case

1332.48 --> 1347.84
well not in a physical sense anyway

1358.32 --> 1365.28
now there is no euclidean space time

1361.6 --> 1368.0
of handler i think you're me

1365.28 --> 1370.48
you're you mean pseudo-ramonian for

1368.0 --> 1370.48
space

1372.84 --> 1378.48
space-time

1374.96 --> 1382.4
euclidean geometry deals with

1378.48 --> 1384.88
the physical realm

1382.4 --> 1384.88
only

1385.44 --> 1389.8400000000001
in a geometric sense so

1396.61 --> 1399.74
[Music]

1405.52 --> 1412.24
yeah well the antarctic tree tree

1408.96 --> 1414.72
creepy treaty that may not stop you from

1412.24 --> 1418.559
visiting but it definitely does prevent

1414.72 --> 1418.559
you from doing anything there

1421.52 --> 1426.4
you're not allowed to travel unlimited

1424.4 --> 1429.2
amounts of distances

1426.4 --> 1431.279
using your own or yeah using your

1429.2 --> 1434.24
yourself

1431.279 --> 1435.919
as an explorer or guide you can't do

1434.24 --> 1437.84
anything without a guide

1435.919 --> 1440.48
telling you basically where to go where

1437.84 --> 1440.48
not to go

1441.039 --> 1446.24
you can do anything you can dig anything

1443.2 --> 1446.24
you can't do anything

1446.4 --> 1459.8400000000001
so yeah you can go to a spot somewhere

1450.96 --> 1459.8400000000001
that's it

1472.88 --> 1475.8400000000001
no alf handler

1478.0 --> 1486.559
the fourth dimension has nothing to do

1480.159 --> 1490.0800000000002
with euclidean geometry

1486.559 --> 1492.1589999999999
the thing about geometry is that it's

1490.08 --> 1494.24
mathematical based

1492.159 --> 1495.6000000000001
and that means it's going to be a

1494.24 --> 1499.039
framework

1495.6 --> 1501.1999999999998
and that framework will apply to what

1499.039 --> 1503.039
it's dealing with only in this case it's

1501.2 --> 1505.919
3d space

1503.039 --> 1508.64
there is no fourth dimensional euclidean

1505.919 --> 1510.64
geometry it doesn't exist

1508.64 --> 1515.8400000000001
it could be conceived of but that would

1510.64 --> 1515.8400000000001
be completely pointless

1541.039 --> 1545.76
poof right well if you're going yeah if

1544.4 --> 1547.52
the u.n

1545.76 --> 1550.08
yeah there's no way they're gonna give

1547.52 --> 1551.039
you permission unless you are part of

1550.08 --> 1554.0
them

1551.039 --> 1555.44
and you go there in secret to screw the

1554.0 --> 1557.76
world over

1555.44 --> 1559.3600000000001
that's the only times the un allows

1557.76 --> 1563.84
anyone to do anything

1559.36 --> 1566.3999999999999
is if you have insidious goals

1563.84 --> 1570.08
that's true it's really sickening when

1566.4 --> 1573.919
you realize that

1570.08 --> 1573.9189999999999
it took me a while to figure that out

1574.32 --> 1585.84
embarrassingly enough

1624.84 --> 1627.84
hmm

1638.84 --> 1643.6
yep

1640.559 --> 1646.799
there is no postulates for time or

1643.6 --> 1649.1999999999998
fourth dimensional geometric orientation

1646.799 --> 1650.72
that's right there's no convention for

1649.2 --> 1654.559
it

1650.72 --> 1657.84
why would you you know i

1654.559 --> 1661.44
could just for the freaking fun of it

1657.84 --> 1664.0
devise a fourth dimensional

1661.44 --> 1667.279
geometrical relation between the fourth

1664.0 --> 1667.279
dimensional realm

1667.6 --> 1672.0
and the three-dimensional realm but god

1673.52 --> 1677.039
i don't know if it would help anyone

1678.559 --> 1683.039
it's probably really difficult to get it

1681.84 --> 1686.48
to be just

1683.039 --> 1688.96
just a visual to try and imagine the

1686.48 --> 1691.1200000000001
fourth dimension versus

1688.96 --> 1692.799
the third dimension because that is at

1691.12 --> 1695.039
this point the best that i can do it's

1692.799 --> 1695.039
just

1695.12 --> 1701.52
improvisingly trying to imagine what

1698.159 --> 1705.279
it would be the space through

1701.52 --> 1705.279
if you were to assume it existed

1705.679 --> 1708.88
and how the dynamics of it could work

1708.48 --> 1711.679
because

1708.88 --> 1713.0390000000002
just because there is space through

1711.679 --> 1715.6000000000001
doesn't mean

1713.039 --> 1717.039
the amount of space through is going to

1715.6 --> 1719.279
be equal everywhere

1717.039 --> 1719.279
see

1720.08 --> 1726.24
so there's all just these yeah i guess

1723.2 --> 1729.8400000000001
structural um

1726.24 --> 1732.72
consequences that you can figure out

1729.84 --> 1734.399
as you are conceptualizing it i'm very

1732.72 --> 1739.84
good at this

1734.399 --> 1739.84
so yeah that's

1740.159 --> 1745.1200000000001
yeah maybe in a way you could uh in a

1743.12 --> 1746.399
surface projection of the earth

1745.12 --> 1748.1589999999999
you could conceive of the fourth

1746.399 --> 1752.559
dimension as being like

1748.159 --> 1756.64
an extra layer that has like

1752.559 --> 1760.08
peaks and dales that's just a

1756.64 --> 1763.2
i don't know just a graph on top of it

1760.08 --> 1765.12
not as part of the

1763.2 --> 1766.3990000000001
of the shape of the earth's surface of

1765.12 --> 1768.2399999999998
course because

1766.399 --> 1770.799
yeah that would interfere with the 3d

1768.24 --> 1773.919
element of it but in order to basically

1770.799 --> 1780.08
show the spatial condensedness

1773.919 --> 1782.88
of the locations

1780.08 --> 1782.8799999999999
for example

1783.279 --> 1789.799
to try and represent the spatial

1786.74 --> 1789.799
[Music]

1792.84 --> 1795.84
dynamics

1802.32 --> 1808.08
yeah in that sense it it could just be

1804.399 --> 1810.7199999999998
represented even as a typical graph

1808.08 --> 1812.559
of situations on earth like magnetic

1810.72 --> 1815.679
lines

1812.559 --> 1818.6399999999999
uh magnetic strength

1815.679 --> 1820.0
those types of things you know the way

1818.64 --> 1822.48
that is represented you don't

1820.0 --> 1823.76
literally see that like magnetics is an

1822.48 --> 1827.039
invisible

1823.76 --> 1830.24
force like there's no visual

1827.039 --> 1833.279
representation for that but then they

1830.24 --> 1836.559
use like these colors

1833.279 --> 1838.799
graphs to represent it well that could

1836.559 --> 1840.1589999999999
be done with spatial density as well

1838.799 --> 1841.9189999999999
which would be

1840.159 --> 1843.3600000000001
i don't know what i could conclude is a

1841.919 --> 1851.8400000000001
natural component of

1843.36 --> 1851.84
a fourth dimension

1870.72 --> 1874.3990000000001
flat on relatively small areas yeah yeah

1873.2 --> 1878.0800000000002
but what about on

1874.399 --> 1881.279
all the relatively huge

1878.08 --> 1884.8799999999999
area surfaces

1881.279 --> 1888.24
photos where you could see the sun

1884.88 --> 1888.24
behind a mountain

1888.32 --> 1895.36
hundreds of miles away

1892.48 --> 1895.679
how about that see it the problem isn't

1895.36 --> 1899.1999999999998
that

1895.679 --> 1900.0800000000002
it just lurks looks so flat on the short

1899.2 --> 1903.1200000000001
term

1900.08 --> 1906.559
the problem for the globe is that

1903.12 --> 1910.0
that flatness can basic

1906.559 --> 1910.399
is only bound by our limit of sight due

1910.0 --> 1913.679
to

1910.399 --> 1916.2399999999998
refraction the blurring up

1913.679 --> 1918.0
of what we can see the edge of our

1916.24 --> 1921.679
vision due to

1918.0 --> 1924.72
well light deviation alteration due to

1921.679 --> 1928.24
what's just in the air it just diffuses

1924.72 --> 1931.039
that causes a limited sight well that

1928.24 --> 1932.08
limited sight varies depending on the

1931.039 --> 1934.24
atmospheric

1932.08 --> 1935.36
or the weather conditions and all that

1934.24 --> 1938.3990000000001
what's in the air how

1935.36 --> 1940.9599999999998
how thick it is and

1938.399 --> 1942.6399999999999
yeah the thing is in the situations

1940.96 --> 1946.799
where it is the thinnest

1942.64 --> 1950.5590000000002
you can just see insanely far so

1946.799 --> 1953.6
that's impossible on the globe

1950.559 --> 1955.9189999999999
that's just absolutely impossible the

1953.6 --> 1963.84
geometry would absolutely not

1955.919 --> 1963.8400000000001
allow that under any circumstances

1964.66 --> 1967.809
[Music]

1978.24 --> 1991.84
eat her band what

2001.76 --> 2005.679
oh that's very simple then charles the

2004.039 --> 2009.519
meruvinian

2005.679 --> 2012.48
troll then just become a flat earth and

2009.519 --> 2015.519
don't tell anyone

2012.48 --> 2017.039
and then you can master the globe

2015.519 --> 2018.3990000000001
arguments from a flat earther

2017.039 --> 2021.679
perspective

2018.399 --> 2022.32
become a much better glober at it and at

2021.679 --> 2024.24
least start

2022.32 --> 2026.399
pointing out everybody's freaking

2024.24 --> 2028.88
clowning around and stupidity

2026.399 --> 2030.4799999999998
on your side on the globe side because

2028.88 --> 2034.7990000000002
they're very stupid

2030.48 --> 2038.48
very stubborn people they'll prioritize

2034.799 --> 2041.519
trying to in their imagination not lose

2038.48 --> 2041.519
face and then lie

2041.679 --> 2049.28
to save face in utter failure well

2046.72 --> 2051.04
if i were really a glober i would hate

2049.28 --> 2053.9190000000003
all these people i can't

2051.04 --> 2056.96
it's just unimaginable that that's that

2053.919 --> 2056.96
they're just doing that

2057.44 --> 2062.2400000000002
to me it would be like yeah you're

2059.04 --> 2062.24
they're just ruining

2062.32 --> 2065.599
the reputation of it

2066.24 --> 2074.72
so yeah just be a flat earther

2070.399 --> 2078.399
if you want right if you want it so much

2074.72 --> 2080.48
and then don't start put a big sticker

2078.399 --> 2082.399
with flat earth on your forehead and

2080.48 --> 2089.839
totally talk about flat earth you know

2082.399 --> 2089.839
you don't have to do that

2100.839 --> 2103.839
so

2114.72 --> 2119.9199999999996
now but guys you're taking it even too

2117.44 --> 2119.92
personal

2120.0 --> 2124.56
people will call you a paranoid

2121.68 --> 2128.64
schizophrenic for a lot of things

2124.56 --> 2130.0789999999997
things that are much less controversial

2128.64 --> 2131.92
than flat earth even

2130.079 --> 2134.88
you gotta realize that and that is that

2131.92 --> 2134.88
people are just

2135.839 --> 2141.04
it the normalization of disgusting

2139.2 --> 2144.56
behavior

2141.04 --> 2147.839
that's why people will do that

2144.56 --> 2150.7999999999997
not even because of flat earth anymore

2147.839 --> 2153.68
people will call you that if you think

2150.8 --> 2153.6800000000003
trump is great

2154.48 --> 2159.2
for example just the universal example

2157.52 --> 2163.2
that a lot of people will get

2159.2 --> 2163.2
right so

2165.68 --> 2172.0789999999997
welcome to the real world where people

2168.64 --> 2173.359
will call you paranoid schizophrenic for

2172.079 --> 2186.7400000000002
disagreeing with

2173.359 --> 2189.8199999999997
their personal niche opinions

2186.74 --> 2189.8199999999997
[Music]

2193.599 --> 2198.4
yeah and

2196.8 --> 2200.2400000000002
yeah the best course of action in the

2198.4 --> 2204.8
face of all that is to

2200.24 --> 2208.7999999999997
avoid these people to absolutely

2204.8 --> 2211.599
no longer care about their opinions

2208.8 --> 2213.599
because they obviously have a severely

2211.599 --> 2218.96
impaired judgment

2213.599 --> 2218.96
to use such terminologies in the face of

2220.72 --> 2227.04
things that obviously do not prove

2223.76 --> 2227.0400000000004
paranoid schizophrenic

2227.2 --> 2231.5989999999997
because that has its own set of symptoms

2233.599 --> 2236.96
but yeah the people that use these words

2236.24 --> 2239.1189999999997
use them

2236.96 --> 2240.0
as a weapon they don't even care really

2239.119 --> 2243.04
about the meaning

2240.0 --> 2247.2
only that it is really mean-spirited

2243.04 --> 2247.2
you see that's the problem

2247.44 --> 2251.04
sliding down into the [ __ ]

2249.599 --> 2257.839
normalization of

2251.04 --> 2257.839
the demonic and disgusting behavior

2268.839 --> 2271.839
so

2273.44 --> 2276.56
oh my god

2277.28 --> 2279.6800000000003
really

2281.599 --> 2299.3590000000004
what the hell

2285.52 --> 2313.839
hold on

2299.359 --> 2313.839
no don't ban anyone

2315.76 --> 2322.1600000000003
right well see

2319.04 --> 2325.599
just look at the marvel

2322.16 --> 2329.1189999999997
of of just this situation happening

2325.599 --> 2330.0
because this is like the this is the

2329.119 --> 2333.52
switcheroo

2330.0 --> 2336.079
world it's like the quantum blinking

2333.52 --> 2336.72
of of certain realities and their exact

2336.079 --> 2338.5600000000004
opposite

2336.72 --> 2340.16
that that's what this guy here in chat

2338.56 --> 2344.4
is doing this is not a a

2340.16 --> 2347.04
ban worthy offense this is a little

2344.4 --> 2348.8
crystalline miracle to me just look at

2347.04 --> 2351.92
what he said

2348.8 --> 2354.0
hey you being brain dead and believing

2351.92 --> 2359.04
in everything that is false is the new

2354.0 --> 2359.04
normal he's right

2359.68 --> 2369.839
he's just probably projecting

2363.92 --> 2371.2000000000003
that into very specific type of category

2369.839 --> 2373.04
because i'm pretty sure the guy's a

2371.2 --> 2376.56
troll but

2373.04 --> 2383.44
yeah isn't that just miraculous he is

2376.56 --> 2386.96
absolutely right he's just not realizing

2383.44 --> 2390.96
that he's talking about himself and this

2386.96 --> 2390.96
this is what ballers do all the time

2395.359 --> 2398.56
unless i'm wrong and hey you is not a

2397.28 --> 2402.4
baller

2398.56 --> 2402.4
in that case it still works out

2409.76 --> 2416.6400000000003
not a bother okay then yeah it also

2413.28 --> 2419.0400000000004
because i have seen ballers do that sort

2416.64 --> 2421.44
of thing like oh

2419.04 --> 2423.119
oh usually they do say the word flat

2421.44 --> 2424.88
earther then next to it they do

2423.119 --> 2428.1600000000003
like to emphasize they don't even go

2424.88 --> 2428.1600000000003
covert with that anymore

2432.24 --> 2439.839
all right anyway welcome to my chat

2447.76 --> 2453.8390000000004
what somebody's claiming they went to

2449.359 --> 2453.839
the moon really

2464.839 --> 2472.88
okay oh i think

2468.48 --> 2475.28
that's pretty silly thing to say

2472.88 --> 2477.2000000000003
that you're able to teleport and that

2475.28 --> 2478.7200000000003
you've been to the fake moon and seen

2477.2 --> 2482.319
the earth is flat

2478.72 --> 2482.319
yeah that's ridiculous

2484.56 --> 2490.56
sometimes i should just not build my

2487.599 --> 2491.92
own fantastical response to just stupid

2490.56 --> 2495.839
comments

2491.92 --> 2495.839
even though i always have this tendency

2497.04 --> 2500.88
it's like every time it and this is

2499.599 --> 2505.04
really a thing that i

2500.88 --> 2508.0
do every time a troll takes a big dump

2505.04 --> 2509.04
like right in front of my feet what i do

2508.0 --> 2512.24
is

2509.04 --> 2515.839
i yeah i

2512.24 --> 2517.68
put some dirt on it plant a seed

2515.839 --> 2522.7999999999997
and then make a really good tree grow

2517.68 --> 2524.48
out of it this is what i do

2522.8 --> 2526.1600000000003
it's like yeah it was meant as a really

2524.48 --> 2528.64
stupid shitty comment and then i

2526.16 --> 2532.16
dissected that stupid shitty comment

2528.64 --> 2534.0789999999997
and turn it into a thing you can learn

2532.16 --> 2536.24
something about

2534.079 --> 2538.4
basically define it almost like

2536.24 --> 2540.24
astrology looking at the stars but no

2538.4 --> 2541.76
i'm just looking at the comment and i'm

2540.24 --> 2546.72
defining

2541.76 --> 2546.7200000000003
so much from it and i just love doing

2548.839 --> 2551.839
that

2553.04 --> 2567.599
what did he say

2565.599 --> 2569.599
yeah that was also kind of stupid i

2567.599 --> 2570.0
don't know if that was time-out worthy

2569.599 --> 2579.839
though

2570.0 --> 2579.839
george sanford

2600.56 --> 2605.52
[Music]

2602.48 --> 2610.96
okay now that's a funny comment tom

2605.52 --> 2621.839
thank you for that that's just hilarious

2610.96 --> 2621.839
it's wrong but it's still hilarious

2624.0 --> 2635.839
now the other tom is just tom

2628.4 --> 2635.839
not tom parker but hello by the way

2647.359 --> 2653.119
see he's had a lot of government funded

2650.88 --> 2655.6800000000003
deep state trolls in here that can't

2653.119 --> 2659.28
take the fact that the earth is concave

2655.68 --> 2663.839
this is thanks it's not concave though

2659.28 --> 2663.8390000000004
but that's kind of funny

2664.24 --> 2671.5989999999997
come on guys that's just

2668.0 --> 2672.56
a well-crafted little joke and if he's

2671.599 --> 2674.88
really concave or

2672.56 --> 2676.56
well yeah i'm sorry to say that if

2674.88 --> 2679.6800000000003
you're going to double down on that

2676.56 --> 2679.68
i will ban you

2682.0 --> 2693.459
but if it was just a joke that's fine

2690.42 --> 2693.4590000000003
[Music]

2700.079 --> 2705.8390000000004
with bird talking what

2710.64 --> 2719.839
okie dokie

2739.119 --> 2745.92
all right yeah and a koala indeed

2742.24 --> 2747.1189999999997
no curve means no concave cavity no

2745.92 --> 2750.2400000000002
convexity

2747.119 --> 2750.2400000000002
no sphericity

2752.319 --> 2755.52
although yeah i have i have reasoned out

2755.119 --> 2757.76
that

2755.52 --> 2760.079
technically it could be the earth is not

2757.76 --> 2764.88
perfectly flat

2760.079 --> 2769.2000000000003
that's why i like to call it flat enough

2764.88 --> 2772.2400000000002
but there's certainly not any type of

2769.2 --> 2774.72
slight curve that well with our limited

2772.24 --> 2779.52
line of sight or even

2774.72 --> 2782.72
i don't know radio scanning and all that

2779.52 --> 2785.839
that we can really get some real

2782.72 --> 2785.839
geometry out of it

2787.599 --> 2803.839
so it's as good as flat flat enough

2806.0 --> 2810.64
well if you're not here to troll well

2808.079 --> 2813.599
why are you picking such a name

2810.64 --> 2813.5989999999997
it's ridiculous

2813.76 --> 2817.28
but yeah i did got pissed off at

2816.16 --> 2820.64
sleeping warrior

2817.28 --> 2824.0
in the chat because of just

2820.64 --> 2827.5989999999997
uh yeah how do you call that

2824.0 --> 2829.599
quality control for the show

2827.599 --> 2831.2000000000003
because the timing when he was doing it

2829.599 --> 2834.2400000000002
was very bad

2831.2 --> 2834.96
he was basically removing simon dan from

2834.24 --> 2837.839
the chat

2834.96 --> 2840.0
as he was being grilled by nathan that's

2837.839 --> 2842.0789999999997
the worst time ever to do that

2840.0 --> 2844.319
because everybody wants to see dan

2842.079 --> 2847.04
squirting in the face of

2844.319 --> 2848.72
just yeah nathan level confrontation and

2847.04 --> 2850.96
it was pissed off because of that

2848.72 --> 2852.8799999999997
specifically

2850.96 --> 2854.7200000000003
like i didn't give a [ __ ] if he's gonna

2852.88 --> 2857.2000000000003
time out simon then

2854.72 --> 2859.839
but that time was it was not the time

2857.2 --> 2859.839
for it

2864.16 --> 2867.2799999999997
he basically ruined a little moment

2866.64 --> 2869.839
there

2867.28 --> 2873.8390000000004
and yeah that's just that got me pissed

2869.839 --> 2873.839
off and i don't think i was the only one

2873.92 --> 2878.48
but yeah than that we're good oh it's

2876.64 --> 2881.52
talking about sleeping worry he posted a

2878.48 --> 2881.52
really good video

2882.16 --> 2887.839
this morning i think or in the evening

2884.72 --> 2887.839
was it

2888.96 --> 2893.76
yeah three hours ago now about

2893.839 --> 2901.839
yeah a a doctor and like

2896.96 --> 2901.839
a pretty prominent person

2903.28 --> 2908.1600000000003
within the german government even that

2905.68 --> 2909.44
has dealt like with the medical boards

2908.16 --> 2911.52
and [ __ ]

2909.44 --> 2912.559
and yeah i haven't finished watching the

2911.52 --> 2914.72
entire thing but

2912.559 --> 2917.0400000000004
like half of it is i'm really impressed

2914.72 --> 2917.04
by it

2918.319 --> 2922.4
so definitely if you're interested in

2921.2 --> 2924.319
that in the slightest

2922.4 --> 2929.839
it's definitely worth checking that out

2924.319 --> 2929.839
at least

2931.359 --> 2946.0789999999997
i'll link up the video

2943.76 --> 2946.079
what

2946.96 --> 2949.2
no

2953.04 --> 2959.52
to explain not

2956.48 --> 2959.52
what i asked for

2964.16 --> 2966.48
all right

2968.4 --> 2988.48
okay here's the link there you go

2985.28 --> 2991.6800000000003
all right simon then that's okay i know

2988.48 --> 2991.68
it's you probably

2994.8 --> 3000.559
yeah but by the way just for the record

2998.24 --> 3002.5589999999997
i'm glad you appreciate me standing up

3000.559 --> 3006.3190000000004
for someone being muted

3002.559 --> 3009.2000000000003
but it was more for just quality

3006.319 --> 3011.2799999999997
control i just i cared more for the

3009.2 --> 3012.0
quality of the show moment than really

3011.28 --> 3015.119
for the person

3012.0 --> 3016.16
being muted because it's a nathan oakley

3015.119 --> 3018.6400000000003
chat

3016.16 --> 3019.2799999999997
there's a lot of shitty comments going

3018.64 --> 3021.44
on there

3019.28 --> 3021.44
so
