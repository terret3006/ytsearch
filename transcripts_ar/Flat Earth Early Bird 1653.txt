and thank you I think it was skeptic

118.5 --> 123.72
was it

120.42 --> 127.07900000000001
yeah I think so sorry I mean I do get

123.72 --> 129.539
PayPal donations but it's like

127.079 --> 130.85999999999999
I do get the names mixed up sometimes

129.539 --> 134.94
because

130.86 --> 137.94000000000003
your YouTube handle is not directly in

134.94 --> 139.2
the paypals and since there are multiple

137.94 --> 141.5
people

139.2 --> 142.92
I sometimes mix you up

141.5 --> 145.86
[Music]

142.92 --> 148.26
so but anyway thanks for the support and

145.86 --> 150.44000000000003
uh yeah hello slo-mo moon buggy first in

148.26 --> 151.79999999999998
chat and dank good to see you

150.44 --> 153.78
[Music]

151.8 --> 156.12
weather

153.78 --> 160.64000000000001
really turn around

156.12 --> 160.64000000000001
and it's just look at that

161.28 --> 167.34
that's not what I expected yesterday

164.59 --> 170.599
[Music]

167.34 --> 170.599
but uh yeah

171.3 --> 177.31900000000002
this pristine blue

173.599 --> 177.319
who would have thought that

183.18 --> 191.15900000000002
it overnight it really cleared up a lot

186.18 --> 196.31900000000002
like at the last half of the night

191.159 --> 199.14
and yeah we can view beautiful blue sky

196.319 --> 202.2
just a little wind but not even yeah the

199.14 --> 204.35999999999999
wind also went away most of it

202.2 --> 206.33999999999997
and I bet it's a lot warmer right now so

204.36 --> 207.72000000000003
yeah this makes perfect sense with what

206.34 --> 210.84
they said

207.72 --> 214.58
the temperature was going to shoot up

210.84 --> 214.58
right plants are enjoying

218.04 --> 221.9
I think by the way that my

222.72 --> 229.62
my second oregano plant is just

227.099 --> 231.599
I don't know what's wrong with it it

229.62 --> 233.159
might be that the roots are just there's

231.599 --> 236.57999999999998
something wrong

233.159 --> 240.239
because it keeps on getting

236.58 --> 242.459
red and basically dying like the new

240.239 --> 244.98000000000002
stuff do comes growing out but it might

242.459 --> 246.18
be like a disease like a rust disease or

244.98 --> 250.07999999999998
something

246.18 --> 254.04000000000002
but the other one isn't doing that

250.08 --> 256.68
but uh yeah yeah it's just

254.04 --> 259.82
this oregano plant it's just not doesn't

256.68 --> 259.82
seem to be working out

260.16 --> 265.46000000000004
anyway

262.919 --> 265.46
beautiful

266.46 --> 273.35999999999996
yellow Terry 306 slo-mo moon buggy

269.699 --> 274.199
skeptic cold yeah he does that doesn't

273.36 --> 278.22
he

274.199 --> 282.0
I saw a video was that him it wasn't on

278.22 --> 284.94000000000005
on a skeptic Channel or anything

282.0 --> 287.52
but he sent me like

284.94 --> 289.88
it was gold he sent me a gold panning

287.52 --> 289.88
video

293.82 --> 299.759
like on as a message on top of the

296.88 --> 302.15999999999997
PayPal and that was kind of interesting

299.759 --> 305.84000000000003
so if that's actually him well then yeah

302.16 --> 305.84000000000003
he scored pretty well I think

307.62 --> 311.52
that's like these giant gold flakes like

310.32 --> 314.65999999999997
really big

311.52 --> 314.65999999999997
that are pretty Epic

316.199 --> 320.54
no nuggets though but I mean still

323.28 --> 327.59999999999997
or is he out

325.139 --> 330.36
digging right now I don't know if he

327.6 --> 333.90000000000003
sent me a video that wasn't his or

330.36 --> 336.06
but yeah apparently he is out digging or

333.9 --> 338.59999999999997
a panning for gold

336.06 --> 338.6
anyway

340.08 --> 348.78
what would it be worth in dollars

345.479 --> 351.36
oh that's really hard to size up skeptic

348.78 --> 354.29999999999995
or turret uh

351.36 --> 357.12
from what I saw

354.3 --> 359.84000000000003
oh Jesus

357.12 --> 359.84000000000003
all together

362.759 --> 366.72
uh

364.44 --> 369.74
uh or if it was really pure gold it

366.72 --> 369.74
probably is then

371.039 --> 376.4
I'd say like a hundred dollars maybe two

374.16 --> 376.40000000000003
hundred

380.039 --> 385.139
but I mean I I I'm not there I can't see

383.4 --> 388.38
it in 3D

385.139 --> 390.84000000000003
I I don't even know physically how big

388.38 --> 392.699
those guys are how big those pans are

390.84 --> 394.31899999999996
I've seen really huge pants I've seen

392.699 --> 396.66
small pants so

394.319 --> 399.24
it's a really rough estimate on my

396.66 --> 402.56
clunky ability to size up the scale

399.24 --> 405.419
which is like one of my worst

402.56 --> 409.94
geometric talents

405.419 --> 409.94
is actually sizing up scale and distance

410.52 --> 417.96
I can really size up well ratios but not

414.36 --> 422.6
act yeah numericals

417.96 --> 422.59999999999997
just that's really difficult for me

423.24 --> 427.68
unless it's really small scale I mean I

425.4 --> 431.35999999999996
know that this is like 10 centimeters

427.68 --> 431.36
all right let's let's check that

431.819 --> 437.58000000000004
locking it in

434.52 --> 439.74
oh CR see I even got that wrong

437.58 --> 443.46
I thought that eight centimeters is 10

439.74 --> 446.16
centimeters it should be this so

443.46 --> 449.15999999999997
wow

446.16 --> 449.16
yeah

449.539 --> 453.3
that's probably why I didn't become a

452.039 --> 455.52
carpenter

453.3 --> 457.74
goes like that's the one skill you

455.52 --> 459.599
really need

457.74 --> 460.86
although I think that if you'd be doing

459.599 --> 464.46
it over and over and over again

460.86 --> 467.66
eventually you'll you'll get it right

464.46 --> 467.65999999999997
just by exposure

468.8 --> 471.999
[Music]

472.38 --> 475.56
but I'm excellent in finding ratios

474.479 --> 477.84
though

475.56 --> 480.62
like on any distance I'll find half of

477.84 --> 480.61999999999995
it like

487.38 --> 489.919
thank you

492.3 --> 499.44
oh you do that too slow mo that's cool

496.919 --> 500.87899999999996
man I would like to do it too sometime I

499.44 --> 502.379
mean there's nothing here in the

500.879 --> 505.62
Netherlands there's lots of rivers

502.379 --> 509.24
there's absolutely no gold

505.62 --> 509.24
I mean there might be some places

510.72 --> 514.2
now

512.159 --> 516.8389999999999
and I don't think there's a there's like

514.2 --> 520.26
barely maybe some places in like France

516.839 --> 521.7600000000001
or something but it's not in the rivers

520.26 --> 524.8199999999999
I don't think

521.76 --> 526.5
or it's just been like industrially

524.82 --> 528.72
mined and

526.5 --> 530.519
they got machines to dig it out or

528.72 --> 533.5400000000001
something I don't know

530.519 --> 535.74
see we have France has been

533.54 --> 537.12
civilized for a very long time so I

535.74 --> 539.36
don't think they have anything in it

537.12 --> 539.36
left

539.519 --> 544.38
maybe deep underground or something

542.459 --> 549.1999999999999
but uh

544.38 --> 549.2
yeah not like in America and Mexico

549.6 --> 553.76
so golden rivers in Mexico too

561.48 --> 567.14
England score what

563.94 --> 567.1400000000001
now maxi

567.54 --> 574.64
George Sanford is he your car over there

570.72 --> 574.64
my nephew became a car over there

598.05 --> 602.16
[Music]

607.7 --> 613.339
wait what are you guys talking about

609.959 --> 613.3389999999999
tarot moxie

618.98 --> 623.839
okay moxie

621.24 --> 623.839
huh

623.94 --> 627.86
okay

625.26 --> 632.04
wow I didn't expect you to be that old

627.86 --> 634.32
with the level of your behavior

632.04 --> 636.899
I thought that you were probably more in

634.32 --> 641.9590000000001
my at my age

636.899 --> 641.959
but on the other hand yeah you could

642.54 --> 648.079
definitely have mature Sons at my age

649.019 --> 654.12
oh Cricket oh okay yeah how am I

652.5 --> 655.86
supposed to know that

654.12 --> 658.5600000000001
fall of England I always thought there

655.86 --> 661.32
was a revolution or something

658.56 --> 664.9399999999999
unless you mentioned the word Cricket I

661.32 --> 664.94
have no idea what you're talking about

666.18 --> 671.0999999999999
you are 43.

669.24 --> 673.32
okay

671.1 --> 677.1
huh

673.32 --> 680.48
I guess you got added right away then

677.1 --> 680.48
I wish I had done that

681.66 --> 687.42
but I was like

683.779 --> 690.86
intangibly awkward

687.42 --> 690.86
around my 20s so

701.64 --> 705.4399999999999
I did sort of try though

705.66 --> 710.16
I might just like even just

708.32 --> 714.86
[Music]

710.16 --> 714.86
I was attracted to just more

714.959 --> 720.54
timid people

718.32 --> 723.9590000000001
because I felt so broken and then you

720.54 --> 725.88
really kind of like feel resonating with

723.959 --> 728.0999999999999
all their broken people

725.88 --> 730.14
that are like weakened because of [ __ ]

728.1 --> 732.6
that's happened

730.14 --> 735.779
seeking Comfort rather than like

732.6 --> 737.76
partnership and that's the girl that's

735.779 --> 740.579
most of the girlfriends I mean they were

737.76 --> 743.579
all except for my third

740.579 --> 743.579
awesome

744.24 --> 748.74
but they were all like damaged all my

747.3 --> 751.38
girlfriend's been damaged it's just

748.74 --> 754.82
because I because I get that because I'm

751.38 --> 754.82
damaged in a way

758.7 --> 764.339
so yeah but damaged girls typically are

762.48 --> 766.139
not very easy to convince to get

764.339 --> 768.86
children

766.139 --> 768.86
at all

769.44 --> 774.48
and at the time it's I started out not

772.079 --> 776.519
even really wanting to I just wanted sex

774.48 --> 779.519
I mean I was that guy

776.519 --> 783.24
because I've been dude I've been

779.519 --> 786.3
obsessed with sex my entire teens and I

783.24 --> 789.36
mean [ __ ] obsessed it wasn't funny

786.3 --> 792.06
it was like unwillingly obsessed with it

789.36 --> 794.339
like I didn't want to think about it but

792.06 --> 795.7199999999999
I continually thought about it was very

794.339 --> 798.9590000000001
annoying

795.72 --> 801.899
because I just couldn't act normal

798.959 --> 805.1999999999999
in the face of women

801.899 --> 807.3
like even the not so even the not so

805.2 --> 809.5790000000001
pretty ones and that's just [ __ ]

807.3 --> 812.279
annoying guys it's annoying when you

809.579 --> 815.0
just spaz out every time there's a woman

812.279 --> 815.0
talking to you

815.519 --> 819.72
ah well that happened most like the

818.04 --> 823.56
early teens I did

819.72 --> 826.88
it eventually learned to like lock it up

823.56 --> 826.88
to be more stoic

827.399 --> 831.3
but Underneath It All I do still just

829.92 --> 834.3
spaz out

831.3 --> 836.8199999999999
in the face of a pretty woman if yeah

834.3 --> 839.3389999999999
but now it's more in response to like

836.82 --> 843.0
it's not just oh they're pretty no

839.339 --> 844.22
it's a multi-dimensional step

843.0 --> 848.279
system

844.22 --> 849.6
is if are they pretty and then what did

848.279 --> 851.82
they do

849.6 --> 854.0400000000001
with their beauty

851.82 --> 858.0790000000001
because that reflects of the person you

854.04 --> 858.079
can see when a person's had a lot of

858.3 --> 862.74
when they build up spite because of

860.459 --> 865.5
misbehavior because they're pretty

862.74 --> 867.839
or you can see when they're like really

865.5 --> 869.94
ambitious and they're using their beauty

867.839 --> 873.48
for their ambition

869.94 --> 877.8000000000001
or when they're really [ __ ] stupid

873.48 --> 879.8000000000001
and they're just leaning on their beauty

877.8 --> 883.8
to get everything easy

879.8 --> 887.519
I can see that of somebody's look

883.8 --> 889.68
so that's what I look now at instead of

887.519 --> 891.6
just passing out over how beautiful they

889.68 --> 895.079
are and how much I want sex with Amazon

891.6 --> 897.5400000000001
because I it's not that

895.079 --> 900.3599999999999
urgent anymore

897.54 --> 902.699
I've had my fair share I mean

900.36 --> 906.66
I've had a bunch of sex

902.699 --> 909.7199999999999
and good good sex too like not where you

906.66 --> 911.9399999999999
just end up like feeling like uh

909.72 --> 914.94
or your dick hurts or something because

911.94 --> 916.62
that does happen if you have sex wrong

914.94 --> 919.32
that's right

916.62 --> 920.699
anyway this is not conversation for 12

919.32 --> 923.6600000000001
plus really

920.699 --> 923.66
but uh

924.54 --> 929.76
it it just

927.66 --> 933.42
I wanted to but it was like I wasn't

929.76 --> 936.6
ready for it yet and that means I wasn't

933.42 --> 940.139
I was probably gonna fail

936.6 --> 944.66
and I don't know I think I can still

940.139 --> 944.66
if but like who wants to you know

950.16 --> 955.5
I mean there's not so many women I I

953.519 --> 958.44
think even are out there that really

955.5 --> 960.6
want kids that aren't already kind of

958.44 --> 962.0400000000001
deranged

960.6 --> 964.5600000000001
because that's a problem there's

962.04 --> 965.519
deranged women out there that want kids

964.56 --> 969.0
too

965.519 --> 973.38
and they want to do the old lgbtq [ __ ]

969.0 --> 976.26
to them like that's out there too

973.38 --> 978.899
although those are usually the the less

976.26 --> 981.079
pretty ones it's a fact that's just a

978.899 --> 981.079
fact

tomorrow

1065.12 --> 1068.12
32.

1068.9 --> 1072.64
then it's going back down again

1073.46 --> 1078.1200000000001
oh well

1074.84 --> 1081.33

oh my God you guys are still talking

1085.64 --> 1088.2990000000002
about cricket

1092.15 --> 1095.3590000000002
[Music]

1100.58 --> 1104.74
yeah steamy traveler like I'm well sex

1103.34 --> 1107.4189999999999
talk it was

1104.74 --> 1109.58
rabbit Moxie and turret are just

1107.419 --> 1112.22
blabbing on about cricket and you can't

1109.58 --> 1116.6
stop them when they do that

1112.22 --> 1120.32
unless you yell at them I don't wanna

1116.6 --> 1123.1999999999998
and Moxie apparently already has kids

1120.32 --> 1125.4189999999999
that are working and all that so I was

1123.2 --> 1127.28
just like oh you can you're probably a

1125.419 --> 1129.2
boomer or something but I mean he's my

1127.28 --> 1132.1399999999999
age

1129.2 --> 1134.559
so yeah he got on the kids thing very

1132.14 --> 1134.5590000000002
quickly

1135.02 --> 1139.34
and so I explained how that didn't

1137.179 --> 1142.76
happen with me and then

1139.34 --> 1146.4189999999999
yeah and up

1142.76 --> 1149.059
talking about sex because of that but uh

1146.419 --> 1150.98
yeah I'm not making that like into an

1149.059 --> 1153.3799999999999
elaborate subject

1150.98 --> 1157.539
uh

1153.38 --> 1157.5390000000002
Moxie made me do it right

1162.74 --> 1165.64
hey clammy

1166.34 --> 1171.1399999999999
better move to it yeah

1168.559 --> 1175.48
I was in a fine mood yesterday

1171.14 --> 1175.48
wasn't a terrible mood the day before

1177.98 --> 1183.14
but I ate better

1181.1 --> 1185.24
a little better

1183.14 --> 1188.0
did try out something interesting that

1185.24 --> 1191.24
turned out to be working really well

1188.0 --> 1193.4
but I had like chicken soup chicken

1191.24 --> 1194.539
vermicelli soup

1193.4 --> 1197.539
like

1194.539 --> 1200.9
after 12 because I realized like no I

1197.539 --> 1203.72
can't fast this one I have to

1200.9 --> 1205.94
get something or I'll be aching

1203.72 --> 1209.059
so I took the chicken firmacelli soup

1205.94 --> 1210.5
and then end the whole bunch of

1209.059 --> 1214.52
spices

1210.5 --> 1216.86
edit like especially turmeric and pepper

1214.52 --> 1218.6
I took the mix that I normally used for

1216.86 --> 1221.7199999999998
turmeric coffee it's still there I

1218.6 --> 1224.36
haven't used it in years now but

1221.72 --> 1227.84
and just dumped a pretty damn big spoon

1224.36 --> 1229.76
in the soup and and it's added some

1227.84 --> 1233.84
ginger

1229.76 --> 1234.98
and man that really hit hit the spot I

1233.84 --> 1238.76
mean like

1234.98 --> 1240.38
I immediately noticed like whoa like all

1238.76 --> 1242.299
my joint issues were just gone

1240.38 --> 1245.0590000000002
immediately

1242.299 --> 1247.76
and I didn't even really expect it I

1245.059 --> 1250.3999999999999
just kind of like did it for the taste

1247.76 --> 1252.799
to see like ah because I do it more

1250.4 --> 1255.44
often that I add Ginger to

1252.799 --> 1257.059
chicken soup to make it like remind me

1255.44 --> 1258.919
more about

1257.059 --> 1261.1399999999999
chicken ginger

1258.919 --> 1264.8600000000001
which is a lot of work to make and

1261.14 --> 1266.8400000000001
expensive and this is much quicker and

1264.86 --> 1270.1999999999998
and I thought like oh yeah just add the

1266.84 --> 1272.84
turmeric mix to it with the pepper in it

1270.2 --> 1275.6200000000001
and dude that was like

1272.84 --> 1275.62
great

1278.179 --> 1283.8200000000002
I really needed that I didn't expect it

1280.4 --> 1286.48
to be that influential in a positive way

1283.82 --> 1286.48
pair

1287.059 --> 1291.9189999999999
one of my favorite spices to cook with

1289.34 --> 1294.08
pepper and salt

1291.919 --> 1297.26
those are definitely my favorites since

1294.08 --> 1300.08
I use them in almost everything

1297.26 --> 1302.36
but uh

1300.08 --> 1305.32
yeah

1302.36 --> 1305.32
oregano

1305.36 --> 1311.059
like

1306.679 --> 1314.02
half the type of meals I eat use oregano

1311.059 --> 1314.02
uh

1317.9 --> 1324.919
yeah and then

1320.419 --> 1328.64
Ginger ginger powder specifically

1324.919 --> 1331.5800000000002
garlic of course that's yeah but that's

1328.64 --> 1333.5
not for everything and

1331.58 --> 1337.6399999999999
basil

1333.5 --> 1340.76
but usually for tomato related meals

1337.64 --> 1344.2990000000002
and I I don't like it dry so

1340.76 --> 1348.919
that's I like the live herb for it

1344.299 --> 1351.58
like picked fresh ah

1348.919 --> 1351.5800000000002
what else

1355.28 --> 1359.6589999999999
I guess you could add turmeric to that

1357.679 --> 1361.94
list but I mean that's going to be very

1359.659 --> 1365.0
specific it's probably turmeric is

1361.94 --> 1366.799
mostly to add with things where I would

1365.0 --> 1369.7
add Ginger

1366.799 --> 1369.7
that were

1374.419 --> 1379.94
what I mean the weird thing is I've

1376.46 --> 1382.52
never really learned to use turmeric in

1379.94 --> 1385.3600000000001
cooking I just learned that it's really

1382.52 --> 1385.36
good for you

1386.059 --> 1391.52
so for me actually applying the tumeric

1388.94 --> 1393.3200000000002
is kind of experimental at this point

1391.52 --> 1395.36
and yesterday was one of those

1393.32 --> 1396.62
experiments and that worked out great it

1395.36 --> 1401.559
was delicious

1396.62 --> 1401.559
and it felt really good worked out great

1403.039 --> 1406.0
basil

1406.84 --> 1411.3999999999999
basil

1408.679 --> 1411.4
no

1415.039 --> 1421.24
I don't care that you pronounce it like

1416.96 --> 1421.24
that and do I'll do it like the British

1423.38 --> 1426.94
I'm not gonna say basil

1438.44 --> 1442.8400000000001
but I mean you can pronounce it that way

1440.36 --> 1442.84
if you want

1444.44 --> 1446.6200000000001
thank you

1447.039 --> 1452.919
can say major

1449.84 --> 1452.9189999999999
two if you like

1453.08 --> 1456.34
I say measure

1461.46 --> 1464.63

moon buggy

1475.22 --> 1481.419
you're in a funny mood I don't you you

1477.5 --> 1481.419

1497.36 --> 1504.28
well me too sort of

1500.78 --> 1504.28
I use potted plants

1519.799 --> 1522.799
hmm

1529.35 --> 1534.9399999999998
[Music]

1543.44 --> 1548.779
what okay

1546.22 --> 1552.7
I guess you really like the taste of

1548.779 --> 1552.7
Basil then there it

1586.9 --> 1590.5
right anyhow

1592.0 --> 1597.52
yeah you can turn it into pesto indeed

1594.74 --> 1597.52
if you're into that

1597.98 --> 1605.74
all amounts medicinal purp what oh okay

1602.559 --> 1605.74
it does

1608.6 --> 1611.86
I didn't realize that

1614.6 --> 1617.6
interesting

1619.7 --> 1623.74
I could technically try that right now

1624.08 --> 1629.6589999999999
let's see I mean yeah it's just just

1627.26 --> 1633.34
having basil the taste of it on its own

1629.659 --> 1633.3400000000001
it almost feels a bit weird to me

1644.84 --> 1647.26
yeah

1647.779 --> 1653.5
that's true

1649.52 --> 1653.5
ah it smells great

1654.799 --> 1659.6
it's a really healthy plant I mean

1657.5 --> 1661.58
the second bezel like really came out

1659.6 --> 1664.76
great although it's unfortunately

1661.58 --> 1666.74
already starting to bloom so

1664.76 --> 1669.62
I think I'm probably not really going to

1666.74 --> 1673.52
be able to use it for spaghetti anymore

1669.62 --> 1676.34
but I I just like basil plant so

1673.52 --> 1678.98
I'll just get another one

1676.34 --> 1682.48
why not

1678.98 --> 1682.48
all right cheers

1732.44 --> 1735.159
never heard of that

[Music]

1759.38 --> 1763.72
can you tell me where are you getting

1761.179 --> 1763.72
that from

1764.179 --> 1767.919
because I've never heard of that before

1786.98 --> 1792.88
I told sea leaves

1790.039 --> 1792.8799999999999

1814.64 --> 1819.0800000000002
wait is it

1816.62 --> 1821.4399999999998
that's a completely different type of

1819.08 --> 1821.4399999999998
bezel

1822.62 --> 1827.799
although it does have a lot of

1825.02 --> 1827.799
similarities

1829.22 --> 1833.74
what a weird it almost looked like a

1831.44 --> 1833.74
nettle

1842.24 --> 1849.02
but is that is that really the same to

1845.48 --> 1852.52
this type of bezel that I have

1849.02 --> 1852.52
like with the round leaves

1857.12 --> 1859.84
huh

1872.059 --> 1875.86
Tulsi Tea oh okay

1880.64 --> 1883.64
interesting

1887.419 --> 1890.0800000000002
foreign

1890.5 --> 1899.12
like that

1893.48 --> 1900.679
or do you actually also use it to like

1899.12 --> 1903.26
cook

1900.679 --> 1905.3600000000001
like add it with tomatoes

1903.26 --> 1907.64
because that's really the primary use

1905.36 --> 1909.74
that that I have for this plant is like

1907.64 --> 1911.6000000000001
this is the thing you want combined with

1909.74 --> 1915.52
tomatoes every time

1911.6 --> 1915.52
it always makes it better

1921.86 --> 1926.74
do you use that holy basil for that as

1924.559 --> 1926.74
well

1941.299 --> 1943.72
everybody

1943.96 --> 1950.799
I think I'm gonna take this Gusto wake

1948.2 --> 1950.799

1998.779 --> 2004.96
I really become I've become used to

2002.44 --> 2006.3400000000001
getting these uh this rookola in the

morning

2006.34 --> 2010.3799999999999

2022.779 --> 2026.86
okay Tara that's a thank you for sharing

2025.899 --> 2030.539
that but

2026.86 --> 2030.539
do you use it

2030.88 --> 2036.5390000000002
in cooking

2033.039 --> 2036.539
with tomatoes

2037.539 --> 2042.96
or do you not

2039.46 --> 2042.96
that was my question Terry

2073.72 --> 2078.6389999999997
come on turret

2075.52 --> 2080.239
this cannot be that hard a question to

2096.96 --> 2104.92

2104.92 --> 2110.2000000000003
like in spaghetti sauce do you guys ever

2108.16 --> 2115.2599999999998
make spaghetti

2110.2 --> 2115.2599999999998
like the Italian or European way

2123.28 --> 2127.1400000000003
10 seconds behind oh okay

2137.74 --> 2144.18
seems about three seconds behind for me

2141.339 --> 2144.18
but uh

2146.14 --> 2149.52
guess you're further away

2162.4 --> 2166.119
I'd still say that's pretty incredible

2164.2 --> 2167.98
by the way

2166.119 --> 2172.5
you imagine

2167.98 --> 2172.5
dared is all the way over in at India

2173.22 --> 2179.7999999999997
and people are all over the way

2177.7 --> 2181.7799999999997
in America

2179.8 --> 2183.4

2181.78 --> 2186.82
what I'm doing

2183.4 --> 2190.2000000000003
like potentially within three seconds

2186.82 --> 2190.2000000000003
that's pretty incredible

2192.339 --> 2195.06
isn't it

2195.76 --> 2201.78
just the effective speed that is

2199.24 --> 2201.7799999999997

2221.56 --> 2226.7999999999997
and I think most of it is thanks to

2223.839 --> 2226.7999999999997
optic fiber

2230.619 --> 2234.94
because the optic fiber is effectively

2232.96 --> 2238.2400000000002
instantaneous

2234.94 --> 2239.68
it it really is right

2238.24 --> 2240.359
the

2239.68 --> 2243.16
the

2240.359 --> 2245.3199999999997
using it as a pipeline to transfer

2243.16 --> 2248.44
information through that could be

2245.32 --> 2250.9
limited could be really big but the

2248.44 --> 2253.2400000000002
actual transfer from one point in the

2250.9 --> 2255.46
glass fiber cable to another is

2253.24 --> 2258.7
literally instantaneous

2255.46 --> 2259.38
it's only like the

2258.7 --> 2263.3199999999997
the

2259.38 --> 2265.599
encoding decoding thing that takes up

2263.32 --> 2267.099
some time it's like the electronic

2265.599 --> 2270.2200000000003
processes are the thing that are

2267.099 --> 2272.6400000000003
actually the time consuming part

2270.22 --> 2276.4599999999996
right from the computer digital

2272.64 --> 2278.68
electronic to then once they are

2276.46 --> 2281.02
transferred into light signals it's

2278.68 --> 2282.7
instantaneous it's effectively

2281.02 --> 2284.98
instantaneous

2282.7 --> 2287.5
but because there's processing times

2284.98 --> 2290.68
with electronics it takes longer right

2287.5 --> 2292.06
if everything would be pure wire

2290.68 --> 2294.339
pure

2292.06 --> 2297.7599999999998
glass wire everything can you imagine

2294.339 --> 2300.339
like no typical internet clicky cables

2297.76 --> 2302.6800000000003
but just everything is default glass

2300.339 --> 2306.099
wire

2302.68 --> 2309.54
dude it would be like there would be no

2306.099 --> 2312.04
delay there would be half a second delay

2309.54 --> 2315.52
at best

2312.04 --> 2319.32
like worldwide

2315.52 --> 2319.32
because light's instantaneous

2322.66 --> 2328.96
isn't that incredible

2325.78 --> 2331.1400000000003
Wireless is also very quick yeah sure it

2328.96 --> 2331.14
is

2339.06 --> 2344.46
delay is built into YouTube not really

2344.5 --> 2348.48
don't know where you're getting that no

2355.96 --> 2359.52
hey good to see you

2362.98 --> 2368.079
how did they turn it into Data into

2365.859 --> 2369.7
lightning back today

2368.079 --> 2372.96
what

2369.7 --> 2372.96
I mean that's not hard

2374.44 --> 2379.0
it's like how do you turn data into an

2376.72 --> 2380.0789999999997
imagery on your screen

2379.0 --> 2382.18
well

2380.079 --> 2384.579
you have a system that

2382.18 --> 2387.339
yeah you just encode it in a certain

2384.579 --> 2390.2200000000003
band of options

2387.339 --> 2393.7
in this case light pulses

2390.22 --> 2396.66
like a system for light pulses

2393.7 --> 2396.66
patterns

2425.2 --> 2428.2799999999997
oh wow really

2429.64 --> 2438.2999999999997
that's okay Georgetown

2433.48 --> 2438.3
800 milliseconds that's crazy

2443.32 --> 2446.98
right but I guess that there is like a

2445.66 --> 2449.6189999999997
whole bunch of

2446.98 --> 2452.2
filters

2449.619 --> 2454.0
now who says that it's actually a delay

2452.2 --> 2456.72
who says it's not just scanning

2454.0 --> 2456.72
processing

2463.42 --> 2469.32
I mean I don't think they just put it on

2465.64 --> 2469.3199999999997
hold for no reason

2469.42 --> 2474.42
they probably do something with that

2471.82 --> 2474.42
delay time

2478.18 --> 2481.98
when I go for a rage when you need to

2480.28 --> 2483.88
pause

2481.98 --> 2486.339
really

2483.88 --> 2489.3
why you need to pause is it because your

2486.339 --> 2492.72
head's gonna blow if you don't pause

2489.3 --> 2492.7200000000003
like mine

2493.69 --> 2496.909
[Music]

2504.57 --> 2507.829
[Music]

2510.52 --> 2515.859
a flatter Sage you can see you

2513.76 --> 2518.1400000000003
hey you you try to stream something

2515.859 --> 2521.3199999999997
yesterday but then before I could take a

2518.14 --> 2524.7599999999998
look you put it on private

2521.32 --> 2524.76
I have no idea what it was

2544.3 --> 2548.2000000000003
you listen to me on speaker while you're

2547.3 --> 2551.579
out

2548.2 --> 2551.5789999999997
okay turret

2552.579 --> 2558.2200000000003
wow so seriously sometimes in the

2555.52 --> 2561.22
streets of India they suddenly hear a

2558.22 --> 2561.22
berserking

2561.78 --> 2568.0600000000004
English-speaking European through some

2564.76 --> 2570.8390000000004
guy speaker all of a sudden

2568.06 --> 2570.839
dude

2574.119 --> 2578.82
and what do your fellow Indians think of

2576.579 --> 2578.82
that

2618.04 --> 2624.339
what

2620.5 --> 2627.119
oh okay flatters you used to you do that

2624.339 --> 2627.119
at your job

2627.28 --> 2632.94
I hope you didn't get fired because of

2629.14 --> 2636.04
doing that Jesus

2632.94 --> 2638.14
when I met share on any platform you

2636.04 --> 2642.16
deem fit that doesn't mean

2638.14 --> 2645.46
put it out of full blast and just

2642.16 --> 2648.7
like play it in the middle of the city

2645.46 --> 2651.46
I don't necessarily deem them fit but I

2648.7 --> 2654.18
mean it's up to you I guess

2651.46 --> 2654.18
Jesus

2663.46 --> 2666.0
thank you

2687.579 --> 2693.4
oh

2690.16 --> 2696.8999999999996
okay yeah why did you put it to private

2693.4 --> 2696.9
platter Sage I couldn't see it

2697.54 --> 2700.719
[Music]

2709.48 --> 2714.78
oh wait you unput it to private now

2720.339 --> 2725.16
why did you set them to private earlier

2733.119 --> 2739.8
cool anyway I'll check that out

2735.4 --> 2739.8
after the show somewhere today

2753.22 --> 2757.18
you didn't

2754.839 --> 2760.96
automatically yeah you have to do that

2757.18 --> 2763.8999999999996
in your uh

2760.96 --> 2766.9
live stream page

2763.9 --> 2768.04
when in your go live page there's a

2766.9 --> 2770.319
function

2768.04 --> 2774.7799999999997
there's basically like this Checker box

2770.319 --> 2774.7799999999997
you need to check all your Checker boxes

2776.44 --> 2781.599
and make sure that it's not

2778.96 --> 2784.119
set to private because after the stream

2781.599 --> 2786.339
is done because that is a yeah a typical

2784.119 --> 2788.46
function you should have that checked

2786.339 --> 2788.46
out

2789.04 --> 2794.68
I mean your go live page is probably the

2791.92 --> 2796.66
most important page to keep really well

2794.68 --> 2799.18
tracked off

2796.66 --> 2800.68
of any page you're doing using if you're

2799.18 --> 2802.839
going to be live streaming regularly

2800.68 --> 2806.5789999999997
it's really important to keep very

2802.839 --> 2806.5789999999997
careful track of what's in there

2807.16 --> 2815.04
or like copy down stream codes and [ __ ]

2811.54 --> 2815.04
in in text files

2816.339 --> 2824.099
all right because every show I do I have

2819.64 --> 2824.0989999999997
to re-edit the go live page

2824.579 --> 2831.2200000000003
and then only after I go live that's

2827.619 --> 2833.26
when I can then edit like a title in and

2831.22 --> 2835.24
I can do it just from this live

2833.26 --> 2837.8190000000004
streaming page

2835.24 --> 2840.5789999999997
don't have to go to go live page do it

2837.819 --> 2844.079
but before the stream the go live page

2840.579 --> 2844.079
is like the only one that

2844.24 --> 2847.54
enables you to properly set up

2846.28 --> 2850.5
everything

2847.54 --> 2850.5
ahead of time

2851.619 --> 2856.56
including what happens to your stream

2853.66 --> 2856.56
after you're done

2858.579 --> 2865.38
add stuff and all that

2862.18 --> 2865.3799999999997
if you have that

2872.14 --> 2876.66
I could help you out a bit if you wanted

2874.359 --> 2876.66
to

2877.42 --> 2882.76
dude if you're like doing live streams

2880.54 --> 2886.44
on camera and everything would you like

2882.76 --> 2886.44
to get on my show sometime

2887.5 --> 2890.94
or are you not risking it

2898.66 --> 2904.1189999999997
I mean that would seem like kind of cool

2902.079 --> 2908.04
and we could talk about gardening and

2904.119 --> 2908.04
stuff and about what you're doing and

2908.2 --> 2912.64
just as long as you don't go all full

2910.599 --> 2914.079
encouraging me oh you need some more

2912.64 --> 2916.42
encouragement because that's just

2914.079 --> 2918.4
annoying it's like not like I don't have

2916.42 --> 2920.7400000000002
enough enthusiasm

2918.4 --> 2924.04
really

2920.74 --> 2927.359
but uh yeah a garden talk like that

2924.04 --> 2927.359
want to do that sometime

2928.42 --> 2934.5
cool all right

2930.76 --> 2934.5
well let's do that sometime just

2934.96 --> 2938.579
get tell me when

2943.78 --> 2946.7400000000002
hello Donato

2948.94 --> 2955.619
what long time no see turret

2952.359 --> 2955.619
he's here all the time

2958.48 --> 2961.96
no uh

2965.619 --> 2970.0
the train needless

2967.78 --> 2971.3190000000004
yeah

2970.0 --> 2974.22
um

2971.319 --> 2974.22
no

2992.92 --> 2996.0
it's not a weird name

2998.2 --> 3001.46
I don't trust you

3014.04 --> 3019.619
like your schedule all right all right

3016.14 --> 3021.2999999999997
yeah because I mean you have a life very

3019.619 --> 3023.099
extensively I take

3021.3 --> 3025.26
so yeah

3023.099 --> 3028.46
just tell me

3025.26 --> 3028.46
when you want to do it

3042.06 --> 3046.7599999999998
oh man the weather is so beautiful

3048.96 --> 3052.28
it's really beautiful

3055.98 --> 3061.7400000000002
like there's no Trail in the sky I can

3058.68 --> 3065.2999999999997
see an airplane there leaving a contrail

3061.74 --> 3065.2999999999997
very little in length

3065.76 --> 3071.8390000000004
barely any Haze of any kind I mean it's

3068.4 --> 3071.839
a little gray near the horizon

3072.3 --> 3075.8
but that's just moist

3079.2 --> 3083.7
I mean if it would be deeper blue that

3081.9 --> 3086.04
would mean it's really dry

3083.7 --> 3087.72
if it were to be deeper blue that would

3086.04 --> 3089.4
actually be a bad sign because then

3087.72 --> 3092.72
probably a lot of the plants would

3089.4 --> 3092.7200000000003
dehydrate very quickly

3103.4 --> 3107.3
yeah the sun is right

3109.859 --> 3114.44
I think the jackdaw's gonna take a bath

3118.5 --> 3123.119
let's see if he's gonna do that yep

3123.24 --> 3126.319
I called it

3163.44 --> 3166.94
there he goes

3187.5 --> 3190.769
[Music]

3194.579 --> 3201.8
it's so funny because when they do that

3197.22 --> 3201.7999999999997
bathing it has this very distinct sound

3205.04 --> 3211.2799999999997
I can't even emulate it this is very

3208.14 --> 3211.2799999999997
specific rhythm

3213.66 --> 3217.859
so I can always hear like that's a bird

3216.119 --> 3220.7400000000002
bathing

3217.859 --> 3223.5789999999997
you can immediately recognize the sound

3220.74 --> 3226.02
foreign

3223.579 --> 3228.98
alike too they all do the same little

3226.02 --> 3228.98
pattern with their wings

3236.16 --> 3240.5
Fourth of July stream was good

3248.099 --> 3253.619
right yeah Donato yeah it must have been

3250.44 --> 3255.48
a long time then like years

3253.619 --> 3258.1400000000003
weren't you around like still in the

3255.48 --> 3258.14
ranty age

3270.0 --> 3275.54
few the outside as my background uh no

3276.119 --> 3280.859
now if I did that you wouldn't be able

3279.059 --> 3284.099
to see my face

3280.859 --> 3288.14
you just see this dark silhouette with a

3284.099 --> 3288.1400000000003
lot of background it wouldn't work

3288.48 --> 3295.02
like not unless my face is just as lit

3292.5 --> 3298.4
as the outside I would have to sit

3295.02 --> 3298.4
outside for that to work

3301.98 --> 3305.839
and then I have to deal with the Wind

3306.42 --> 3311.94
and that I still have to see my my video

3309.48 --> 3313.98
screen and some yeah then every time I

3311.94 --> 3316.44
have to do anything I have to like walk

3313.98 --> 3318.42
up away from the camera towards the

3316.44 --> 3319.619
keyboard to type something

3318.42 --> 3324.66
it's not

3319.619 --> 3324.6600000000003
really adorable plan

3332.76 --> 3337.8
no it's it's a nice idea then after it

3335.4 --> 3339.0
just it with my setup it doesn't really

3337.8 --> 3342.0
work

3339.0 --> 3343.98
I had died that idea like it would be

3342.0 --> 3345.359
kind of cool if I could do that

3343.98 --> 3348.119
but

3345.359 --> 3351.44
I mean it would be better if I had like

3348.119 --> 3355.319
a proper mobile camera or something

3351.44 --> 3357.78
I wonder if there's just webcams that go

3355.319 --> 3360.119
on Wi-Fi or something like not that I

3357.78 --> 3361.44
love that but I mean it would give me an

3360.119 --> 3364.26
option

3361.44 --> 3367.2000000000003
if I could just take a freaking webcam

3364.26 --> 3369.48
do it like a mobile non-stick type thing

3367.2 --> 3371.52
except I don't have a mobile I just have

3369.48 --> 3373.859
one webcam thingy

3371.52 --> 3375.72
that it could just walk outside and just

3373.859 --> 3379.859
go on the roof like yeah check it out

3375.72 --> 3381.2999999999997
this is this is my view 360. like that

3379.859 --> 3384.2999999999997
would be pretty cool if I could do that

3381.3 --> 3386.04
then it had a mic and a webcam

3384.3 --> 3389.8390000000004
that would still be connected to my

3386.04 --> 3389.839
computer through Wi-Fi or something

3390.78 --> 3395.599
it would be kind of cool to have that as

3393.119 --> 3395.599
an option

3398.28 --> 3402.5400000000004
especially if I could like live plug it

3400.619 --> 3405.3
although I think that

3402.54 --> 3408.48
if I did that like OBS probably would

3405.3 --> 3410.3390000000004
not take kindly to your new device in

3408.48 --> 3411.96
the middle of a recording

3410.339 --> 3415.02
this is

3411.96 --> 3417.599
but uh yeah I mean if there's something

3415.02 --> 3419.9
out there that is like that and it's not

3417.599 --> 3423.98
like immediately 200 Euros or something

3419.9 --> 3423.98
that would be pretty cool to have

3427.26 --> 3432.9
like a webcam with a good an actual good

3430.5 --> 3435.48
quality mic

3432.9 --> 3438.9
that is windproof

3435.48 --> 3440.78
or mostly windproof that has a decent

3438.9 --> 3443.1600000000003
Wi-Fi distance

3440.78 --> 3446.3590000000004
USB connection

3443.16 --> 3446.359
with the computer

3446.64 --> 3452.339
that could like reach

3450.359 --> 3455.46
50 feet

3452.339 --> 3458.2799999999997
50 or maybe even 100 feet

3455.46 --> 3461.28
I don't know if it could reach like from

3458.28 --> 3464.8190000000004
here to the end of that roof

3461.28 --> 3466.559
like where the cheat the last chimney is

3464.819 --> 3469.22
I don't know how much distance that is

3466.559 --> 3469.2200000000003
exactly

3470.4 --> 3473.6600000000003
that will be pretty cool

3476.88 --> 3483.9
hey Donata thanks for becoming a ranger

3480.78 --> 3486.02
thanks for becoming a member appreciate

3483.9 --> 3486.02
it

3486.599 --> 3491.2200000000003
hmm

3488.52 --> 3494.46
yeah if you also by the way want to

3491.22 --> 3497.339
directly support me because I do like

3494.46 --> 3500.4
support in general

3497.339 --> 3502.44
the PayPal would be the thing to do

3500.4 --> 3505.079
because I get

3502.44 --> 3507.059
the money directly out of the PayPal and

3505.079 --> 3511.2000000000003
then get it pretty quickly

3507.059 --> 3513.2400000000002
any support that is through Google

3511.2 --> 3516.299
well I don't get any income from that

3513.24 --> 3519.4799999999996
it's kind of good for my stats but

3516.299 --> 3521.52
that's about it and these days I I tend

3519.48 --> 3522.9
to not really care too much for the

3521.52 --> 3525.839
stats

3522.9 --> 3528.839
I mean it's also

3525.839 --> 3528.839
convoluted

3528.9 --> 3532.88
they already manipulate everything

3530.52 --> 3532.88
anyway

3540.18 --> 3542.72
what

3546.74 --> 3551.9399999999996
a curcuma

3549.48 --> 3554.7
you call that cumin

3551.94 --> 3556.619
of course of course the Americans would

3554.7 --> 3559.9199999999996
call it cumin because they just can't

3556.619 --> 3562.579
say a word that's slightly more

3559.92 --> 3562.579
complicated

3562.68 --> 3568.9199999999996
I mean what's Difficult about kurkuma

3565.92 --> 3568.92
ah

3569.7 --> 3575.16
no cumin we can say kurukuma because

3573.24 --> 3579.24
that would actually require us to have

3575.16 --> 3582.02
any kind of expression of verbal skills

3579.24 --> 3582.02
we're American

3584.339 --> 3586.819
sorry

3587.76 --> 3593.5400000000004
it's sometimes frustrates me how much

3590.04 --> 3593.54
that tends to happen

3594.839 --> 3603.599
I mean when I we have French words in

3599.339 --> 3606.54
Dutch and when I speak them I pronounce

3603.599 --> 3609.78
them like the French words

3606.54 --> 3611.099
because you're supposed to do that in

3609.78 --> 3613.079
Dutch

3611.099 --> 3616.38
there's Dutch people that don't even

3613.079 --> 3621.02
know those words just

3616.38 --> 3621.02
not everybody here has such an elaborate

3621.299 --> 3628.7
language palette available to them

3626.28 --> 3628.7000000000003
oh

3628.92 --> 3636.059
you sent me oh okay thanks Donato

3634.02 --> 3640.04
that was quick

3636.059 --> 3640.0400000000004
all right I'll check it out thank you

3646.98 --> 3651.839
whoa

3649.02 --> 3652.95
thank you very much for the for the

3651.839 --> 3654.9
support

3652.95 --> 3659.1189999999997
[Music]

3654.9 --> 3659.119
33 euros that's hilarious

3660.359 --> 3664.44
but uh

3661.74 --> 3666.359
hilariously useful

3664.44 --> 3668.64
thank you very much

3666.359 --> 3671.48
I really appreciate the sport

3668.64 --> 3671.48
welcome back

3675.9 --> 3678.7400000000002
hmm

3679.819 --> 3686.2799999999997
that 200 Reyes for what what does that

3684.839 --> 3689.599
mean

3686.28 --> 3689.599
what's a race

3703.98 --> 3708.059
300 react what

3706.26 --> 3711.9
okay

3708.059 --> 3715.099
does anybody know what race is I I don't

3711.9 --> 3715.099
even know how to pronounce that

3716.27 --> 3722.18
[Music]

3717.96 --> 3722.18
hell is it a race

3725.76 --> 3730.5200000000004
what country uses real oh Brazil

3730.619 --> 3733.1600000000003
huh

3733.339 --> 3737.7799999999997
all right

3735.54 --> 3741.619
one raise is

3737.78 --> 3741.619
0.90 Euro cents

3742.559 --> 3748.1400000000003
oh it's also called the Brazilian real

3745.92 --> 3750.799
they call that the riais

3748.14 --> 3750.799
weird

3754.14 --> 3759.5989999999997
what a strange choice for

3756.54 --> 3762.319
for that word but okay you're Brazilian

3759.599 --> 3762.319
thanks

3764.94 --> 3768.839
I was Brazil doing these days man I

3767.16 --> 3771.359
heard like a whole bunch of [ __ ] is

3768.839 --> 3775.98
happening there

3771.359 --> 3778.7599999999998
like liberals taken back like

3775.98 --> 3778.76
the place

3778.98 --> 3784.799
and like being trying to get the bull

3782.64 --> 3787.22
shanero like out of the picture and all

3784.799 --> 3787.22
that [ __ ]

3788.88 --> 3794.1800000000003
it's really a bummer because I mean

3790.799 --> 3794.18
Brazil was doing great

3794.4 --> 3797.7200000000003
for a whole long time

3801.42 --> 3804.78
think

3802.44 --> 3807.37
I don't know man it's very

3804.78 --> 3810.949
conflicting I guess

3807.37 --> 3810.949
[Music]

3821.28 --> 3828.599
but everybody kind of saw that guy like

3824.819 --> 3830.88
a bit like the Brazilian Trump

3828.599 --> 3833.2200000000003
so that might mean that a lot of people

3830.88 --> 3835.52
hate him and that is the same amount I

3833.22 --> 3835.52
don't know

3836.7 --> 3840.98
if you don't want to talk about it

3838.26 --> 3840.98
completely understand

3851.98 --> 3855.09
[Music]

3856.98 --> 3864.559
Ria the real it's a singular and Rey

3860.94 --> 3864.559
what a weird plural

3866.579 --> 3870.48
the current president has practically

3868.619 --> 3874.079
been put in the current position yeah

3870.48 --> 3877.7400000000002
because he's a globalist stooge

3874.079 --> 3879.2400000000002
like a blatant communist globalist too I

3877.74 --> 3881.4199999999996
don't even know why that guy's still

3879.24 --> 3881.4199999999996
alive

3886.68 --> 3891.96
I mean

3888.48 --> 3894.2400000000002
I hope Brazil actually realizes that

3891.96 --> 3896.94
that political group

3894.24 --> 3899.339
all they ever do is

3896.94 --> 3902.099
give Mega corporations that are

3899.339 --> 3903.0589999999997
completely Psychopathic more power and

3902.099 --> 3906.319
control

3903.059 --> 3906.3190000000004
instead of the nation

3907.619 --> 3914.46
and like they will destroy the quality

3912.119 --> 3916.26
of your country in every conceivable way

3914.46 --> 3917.46
whatever they can get away with that's

3916.26 --> 3919.0200000000004
what they do

3917.46 --> 3921.42
and they probably think they're doing

3919.02 --> 3924.119
the right thing too because those actual

3921.42 --> 3926.2200000000003
Communists are completely insane like

3924.119 --> 3928.2000000000003
that those types

3926.22 --> 3931.14
we're not talking about people that are

3928.2 --> 3933.48
like in communes

3931.14 --> 3936.7799999999997
talking about like

3933.48 --> 3940.079
political Marxist communists

3936.78 --> 3943.2000000000003
like the wef people

3940.079 --> 3945.2400000000002
right I understand that apparently in

3943.2 --> 3946.3799999999997
Eastern Europe and even Russia they're

3945.24 --> 3950.7599999999998
still like

3946.38 --> 3954.96
soft yet government structures

3950.76 --> 3957.2990000000004
and like setups that they still use and

3954.96 --> 3959.7
they just use it well

3957.299 --> 3962.9
and that's possible so that there you

3959.7 --> 3965.7599999999998
can't even have partial communist

3962.9 --> 3966.9
originated governments that are very

3965.76 --> 3969.9
functional

3966.9 --> 3972.48
right but that's why because they're not

3969.9 --> 3974.76
Marxist

3972.48 --> 3977.46
right even though communism was kind of

3974.76 --> 3980.059
founded with Marxism

3977.46 --> 3980.059
like

3980.099 --> 3985.02
at the back at the ready to use for

3983.099 --> 3987.78
power right

3985.02 --> 3989.9
they don't have you don't have to use it

3987.78 --> 3993.42
while this new

3989.9 --> 3996.119
wef communist type figures these

3993.42 --> 3998.52
globalists they like use Marxism as

3996.119 --> 4000.619
default like give them an inch and they

3998.52 --> 4003.74
will immediately start attacking

4000.619 --> 4007.819
everything to weaken it

4003.74 --> 4009.799
with corruption and poison just to get

4007.819 --> 4012.44
more control

4009.799 --> 4014.72
just to make them less capable of

4012.44 --> 4017.92
resisting

4014.72 --> 4017.9199999999996
and that's a big difference

4018.5 --> 4023.299
and that guy

4021.14 --> 4025.8799999999997
in Brazil That's now taken over

4023.299 --> 4028.52
everything that I've seen from who that

4025.88 --> 4031.48
is and how he's connected he is a Wes

4028.52 --> 4031.48
scumbag

4031.7 --> 4036.98
so he is a Marxist and he is going to

4034.359 --> 4039.859
degrade the quality of your country and

4036.98 --> 4042.559
do not underestimate how far people like

4039.859 --> 4045.98
that take it I mean if you let them

4042.559 --> 4048.6800000000003
they'll freaking like spray

4045.98 --> 4050.42
spray everything

4048.68 --> 4053.5389999999998
to kill it

4050.42 --> 4055.46
if if that kind of works out in a point

4053.539 --> 4058.8190000000004
they're making right

4055.46 --> 4061.76
I mean do not underestimate what what

4058.819 --> 4063.319
these types can do

4061.76 --> 4065.0
like

4063.319 --> 4067.16
they wouldn't just like oh we're gonna

4065.0 --> 4070.28
spray everything and it's dead no but if

4067.16 --> 4073.0389999999998
they had an excuse right just like

4070.28 --> 4075.02
what's happening in Canada it's like

4073.039 --> 4077.96
they have an excuse to do it right

4075.02 --> 4080.599
they're not just lighting the forest on

4077.96 --> 4082.42
Fires with all these climate cultists no

4080.599 --> 4084.1600000000003
they're doing it

4082.42 --> 4086.96
to

4084.16 --> 4088.64
force politically people into the

4086.96 --> 4090.319
climate change again so they're burning

4088.64 --> 4092.72
down the force for a reason that they

4090.319 --> 4095.5389999999998
think is good they just have to do it

4092.72 --> 4098.0
that's Marxism right that's the Mind

4095.539 --> 4100.279
Control Marxism that they're using

4098.0 --> 4103.16
well

4100.279 --> 4106.040000000001
they could do that anywhere

4103.16 --> 4109.5199999999995
like if they have a reason right I mean

4106.04 --> 4111.679
that's the type of thing like what if a

4109.52 --> 4113.4800000000005
country with the government and the

4111.679 --> 4115.339
military they're like yeah we're really

4113.48 --> 4117.3189999999995
prepared for a war we actually want to

4115.339 --> 4120.799
test out these new weapons

4117.319 --> 4123.4400000000005
well then a Marxist communist politician

4120.799 --> 4126.799
might get into a spat right with some

4123.44 --> 4128.719
Nash more nationalist oriented country

4126.799 --> 4131.48
that that isn't connected to the

4128.719 --> 4135.259
globalist and then like oh start poking

4131.48 --> 4137.3589999999995
them poking them and then get officials

4135.259 --> 4139.219
there to respond and get added or get

4137.359 --> 4141.679
the public riled up there so that they

4139.219 --> 4144.199
hate you and all that start yelling and

4141.679 --> 4147.02
then it's like oh oh okay send the guys

4144.199 --> 4151.04
out we need some false flag [ __ ] and

4147.02 --> 4153.7390000000005
then they oh they attacked us oh no see

4151.04 --> 4156.0199999999995
they cannot be trusted

4153.739 --> 4158.799
and then they'll attack the country

4156.02 --> 4161.96
weakening the public more

4158.799 --> 4165.0199999999995
deflecting anger towards the opponent

4161.96 --> 4167.0
with the ideological opponent

4165.02 --> 4170.0
and

4167.0 --> 4172.58
try to force the the get more arguments

4170.0 --> 4175.219
there or a war or something use that

4172.58 --> 4178.339
military right this is how

4175.219 --> 4181.52
communist marxists operate

4178.339 --> 4184.219
so you have to be very [ __ ] careful

4181.52 --> 4187.1
when you have those types of people at

4184.219 --> 4191.179
the help it's very dangerous because

4187.1 --> 4192.819
they will abuse any situation to [ __ ]

4191.179 --> 4197.92
the public over

4192.819 --> 4197.92
any situation every time

4198.5 --> 4203.56
very careful with that and be very very

4201.08 --> 4203.5599999999995
careful

4203.9 --> 4208.699
I mean the only proper

4206.84 --> 4212.96
solution to that

4208.699 --> 4217.879999999999
is what was it called again the guy

4212.96 --> 4219.7390000000005
wasn't that that Chilean General guy

4217.88 --> 4223.3
it's his name again I forgot somebody

4219.739 --> 4223.299999999999
brought that up a while ago

4225.739 --> 4228.5199999999995
let me check

4230.78 --> 4237.0199999999995
yeah Pinochet yeah

4233.6 --> 4239.900000000001
that's the way to fix it

4237.02 --> 4242.900000000001
you take them you take them all you take

4239.9 --> 4246.259999999999
them hard and you have like no you give

4242.9 --> 4250.82
them no way out no [ __ ] Mercy

4246.26 --> 4253.52
no mercy like under any circumstance

4250.82 --> 4254.78
like that's how you take care of

4253.52 --> 4256.46
communism

4254.78 --> 4260.92
and globalism

4256.46 --> 4260.92
no [ __ ] Mercy not an inch

4263.06 --> 4267.7390000000005
but I mean yeah if you're going to be oh

4265.4 --> 4270.44
but we're modern we're about to Glow

4267.739 --> 4272.239
well we'll even tolerate days yeah well

4270.44 --> 4273.5
then you're a bunch of [ __ ] wussies

4272.239 --> 4276.259999999999
and you're probably not gonna do that

4273.5 --> 4279.92
are you because you're too faggity

4276.26 --> 4282.679
do you actually do what needs to be done

4279.92 --> 4285.56
you're too much of a [ __ ] now yeah well

4282.679 --> 4288.26
Chile wasn't too much of a [ __ ]

4285.56 --> 4291.14
when Pinochet got in power and that's

4288.26 --> 4293.92
why they were able to do what's

4291.14 --> 4293.92
necessary

4295.64 --> 4301.219
so I hope that Brazil hasn't slid off

4298.699 --> 4303.98
too far

4301.219 --> 4307.78
and it can still achieve

4303.98 --> 4307.78
what is truly necessary

4314.9 --> 4316.9
um

4323.54 --> 4326.54
anyways

4347.06 --> 4349.54
there

4350.54 --> 4357.8
U.S could help them out yeah flatter

4354.679 --> 4360.82
Sage we all know how the US helps out

4357.8 --> 4364.58
other countries

4360.82 --> 4366.739
yeah oh they'll just help I mean they're

4364.58 --> 4369.739
not gonna like

4366.739 --> 4374.36
either plunder the resources secretly

4369.739 --> 4377.839999999999
plunder their museums or like force a

4374.36 --> 4380.179
deal of some kind like oh you oh that's

4377.84 --> 4383.6
cool we'll help you out but you have to

4380.179 --> 4386.5
now promote LGBT Pride

4383.6 --> 4392.179
you have to do that now

4386.5 --> 4394.64
right or I don't know trash a few places

4392.179 --> 4397.6990000000005
here and there that just people like

4394.64 --> 4399.62
Mega corporations just they just had all

4397.699 --> 4401.9
that plan they just happen to have that

4399.62 --> 4403.76
plan to build a compound there right and

4401.9 --> 4405.799999999999
all I was in the way is just these

4403.76 --> 4408.1990000000005
stupid people living there and oh well

4405.8 --> 4410.78
it was blown up

4408.199 --> 4415.12
yeah buddy by the enemy

4410.78 --> 4415.12
oh how convenient yeah yeah yeah

4416.36 --> 4421.099999999999
I mean

4418.34 --> 4423.32
America doesn't help out other countries

4421.1 --> 4427.120000000001
without a price

4423.32 --> 4427.12
and the price always sucks

4435.199 --> 4440.78
yeah

4436.76 --> 4443.780000000001
and I mean dude it it doesn't make any

4440.78 --> 4446.239
sense either like just imagine for a

4443.78 --> 4448.34
second that Trump would get back into

4446.239 --> 4450.86
power and I think he will actually

4448.34 --> 4452.78
I think he's gonna win maybe a bit early

4450.86 --> 4455.62
of me to say but

4452.78 --> 4455.62
I mean

4458.239 --> 4463.04
it comparts with my Visions I I

4460.82 --> 4465.199
shouldn't do that

4463.04 --> 4466.04
I shouldn't just overtly say who's gonna

4465.199 --> 4468.879999999999
win

4466.04 --> 4468.88
that's crazy

4469.4 --> 4473.36
or you're gonna think I'm crazy I don't

4471.32 --> 4476.179
know it makes me like I'm not supposed

4473.36 --> 4477.44
to do that but

4476.179 --> 4481.0
I mean

4477.44 --> 4481.0
would he even

4481.159 --> 4485.36
like help out somebody like Boston Arrow

4483.739 --> 4487.9
like that

4485.36 --> 4487.9
you know

4487.94 --> 4494.36
I mean Trump has praised good things of

4492.44 --> 4495.98
other leaders but would he then help

4494.36 --> 4499.96
them out

4495.98 --> 4499.959999999999
I haven't seen him actually do that

4500.659 --> 4507.98
right so even if there was a good leader

4504.26 --> 4509.54
or a better one in ways in control of

4507.98 --> 4512.78
the United States

4509.54 --> 4515.78
I don't really see them like helping a

4512.78 --> 4518.36
big country like Brazil

4515.78 --> 4522.139999999999
get back on top of the situation because

4518.36 --> 4525.08
it's a competition and the U.S is like

4522.14 --> 4528.26
really obsessed with other countries

4525.08 --> 4530.84
competing like all the time

4528.26 --> 4534.1990000000005
it's like their main Obsession they

4530.84 --> 4535.9400000000005
always want to be on top a pile of [ __ ]

4534.199 --> 4538.4
so if they're going to help out they

4535.94 --> 4541.219
always want to end up on top of that

4538.4 --> 4544.7
situation or they just don't do business

4541.219 --> 4547.8
on an international scale like that

4544.7 --> 4547.8
[Music]

4561.5 --> 4567.62
okay the right well Donato yeah voting

4564.92 --> 4570.9400000000005
it's cool

4567.62 --> 4574.5199999999995
well if you want your voting situation

4570.94 --> 4577.639999999999
improved well you I wouldn't exactly

4574.52 --> 4583.610000000001
look to the United States for help with

4577.64 --> 4590.25
that if you know what I mean Jesus

4583.61 --> 4590.25
[Music]

4597.56 --> 4604.6990000000005
to be fair you know at this point

4601.64 --> 4609.02
I wouldn't even do it like like it well

4604.699 --> 4611.599999999999
it is voting like this even

4609.02 --> 4614.0
durable for the future

4611.6 --> 4616.46
I mean the idea is cool

4614.0 --> 4619.46
but look at how many [ __ ] up crazy

4616.46 --> 4620.9
people there are that will just vote on

4619.46 --> 4624.14
their own destruction

4620.9 --> 4626.12
like knowingly like knowing oh it's bad

4624.14 --> 4627.92
for our country and we're racist or

4626.12 --> 4629.719
something right and they'll keep doing

4627.92 --> 4631.58
that now they keep doing that when

4629.719 --> 4634.46
people get slaughtered and they'll still

4631.58 --> 4635.659
keep doing like

4634.46 --> 4637.88
with

4635.659 --> 4641.719
a substantial amount of those people

4637.88 --> 4644.62
around and no way of making them decline

4641.719 --> 4644.62
in amounts

4644.96 --> 4650.06
how are you gonna

4646.94 --> 4653.239
form a durable democracy on the long run

4650.06 --> 4655.64
this is a serious question here

4653.239 --> 4658.4
yep

4655.64 --> 4662.2390000000005
I prefer

4658.4 --> 4663.679
teams like good solid teams and it's

4662.239 --> 4666.799999999999
really tough

4663.679 --> 4668.9
it's like the Putin government

4666.8 --> 4672.38
it's the same guys

4668.9 --> 4675.379999999999
like they are not gonna allow democracy

4672.38 --> 4677.62
to [ __ ] up their country anymore like

4675.38 --> 4677.62
that

4677.84 --> 4683.14
and I applaud them for it

4680.36 --> 4683.139999999999
yes

4687.739 --> 4691.459999999999
right

4688.82 --> 4695.54
if you're gonna allow a real democracy

4691.46 --> 4699.62
well then you have to get very strict

4695.54 --> 4701.9
and not liberal not free you want

4699.62 --> 4704.0
democracy that's cool then you can't

4701.9 --> 4707.5
have the freedom to do whatever the [ __ ]

4704.0 --> 4707.5
you want and get all insane

4711.56 --> 4716.780000000001
if you want democracy to work

4714.46 --> 4720.26
you can't

4716.78 --> 4722.42
like have gay marriage that sounds crazy

4720.26 --> 4725.0
like why not well because the people

4722.42 --> 4728.679
that want that are [ __ ] insane

4725.0 --> 4728.679
they're they're twisting everything

4730.64 --> 4734.780000000001
right

4731.96 --> 4735.92
it's because they want it publicly I

4734.78 --> 4738.139999999999
mean

4735.92 --> 4742.04
what you wanted Rachel to be seen and

4738.14 --> 4745.3
how gay you are like that's wrong

4742.04 --> 4749.06
that's degenerate it's gonna Echo more

4745.3 --> 4751.400000000001
degeneracy it's gonna make democracy go

4749.06 --> 4754.159000000001
screwed up and people obsessed with the

4751.4 --> 4757.78
wrong thing and ignoring the thing that

4754.159 --> 4757.78
are most the most important

4758.239 --> 4761.12
that's what's hap that's what's gonna

4759.92 --> 4763.1
happen

4761.12 --> 4764.96
so if you want a democracy then you're

4763.1 --> 4766.400000000001
gonna have to have really strict rules

4764.96 --> 4769.04
because

4766.4 --> 4772.159
if you want the people to have the power

4769.04 --> 4773.239
to vote then you must guarantee that

4772.159 --> 4777.92
they don't

4773.239 --> 4780.86
easily become degenerates

4777.92 --> 4783.62
why because

4780.86 --> 4785.839999999999
if that's possible then the amount of

4783.62 --> 4787.58
degenerates over time will grow and they

4785.84 --> 4791.84
will perpetuate and then they will

4787.58 --> 4794.0
outnumber the amount of sane voters and

4791.84 --> 4796.52
then they will actively and knowingly

4794.0 --> 4799.28
vote for the destruction of themselves

4796.52 --> 4802.400000000001
and their country just to avenge those

4799.28 --> 4803.239
that aren't insane just to get back at

4802.4 --> 4805.04
them

4803.239 --> 4807.379999999999
it's like you're not a [ __ ]

4805.04 --> 4810.14
degenerate so I'm gonna just destroy

4807.38 --> 4813.5
everything just to get to you

4810.14 --> 4815.780000000001
that's the situation you end up with

4813.5 --> 4818.84
you get a lot of degenerates that that

4815.78 --> 4822.5
destroy everything that will destroy

4818.84 --> 4826.64
their own food supply just to get at

4822.5 --> 4829.78
those that refuse to dance along with

4826.64 --> 4829.780000000001
their [ __ ]

4842.6 --> 4847.51
foreign

4844.42 --> 4847.51
[Music]

4851.48 --> 4858.459999999999
did my views on homosexuality changed

4854.179 --> 4858.46
drastically after I kissed the man yeah

4859.58 --> 4865.219
it did that was the turning point that

4862.52 --> 4868.219
was that the time that I realized I made

4865.219 --> 4870.26
a huge mistake not a big mistake a huge

4868.219 --> 4873.08
mistake

4870.26 --> 4874.820000000001
and that I was basically cursed all

4873.08 --> 4877.1
along because

4874.82 --> 4878.179
you got to realize that I was kind of

4877.1 --> 4880.88
like

4878.179 --> 4884.179
sort of thought I was gay

4880.88 --> 4887.179
in a in a non-sexual way I guess it's

4884.179 --> 4889.1
just everybody continually convinced me

4887.179 --> 4892.28
of that [ __ ]

4889.1 --> 4895.219
because I was just expressive

4892.28 --> 4898.34
and I wasn't like stoic like a man and

4895.219 --> 4900.62
all that and so people just assumed I

4898.34 --> 4903.08
was gay and all these [ __ ] gays were

4900.62 --> 4905.0599999999995
always like oh you're so cute

4903.08 --> 4906.739
and then yeah what the [ __ ] are you

4905.06 --> 4908.84
supposed to do with that if everybody

4906.739 --> 4911.839999999999
continually tells you you're [ __ ] gay

4908.84 --> 4914.96
when you don't even realize what that is

4911.84 --> 4917.659000000001
yeah they basically did with me what

4914.96 --> 4920.08
they do with little children now because

4917.659 --> 4923.659
I happen to be really childish

4920.08 --> 4926.719
childishly gullible for a very long

4923.659 --> 4929.599999999999
[ __ ] time into my 20s

4926.719 --> 4932.6
and it's really bizarre to realize that

4929.6 --> 4935.719
about myself but I was

4932.6 --> 4938.659000000001
yeah but yeah when I kissed that guy

4935.719 --> 4941.2390000000005
that one time one [ __ ] time

4938.659 --> 4943.759999999999
I almost literally threw up and I

4941.239 --> 4947.239
realized no

4943.76 --> 4949.6990000000005
this is as far as it goes like I am not

4947.239 --> 4953.178999999999
gay it's not gonna work I'm not gonna

4949.699 --> 4955.04
force myself to somehow make this work I

4953.179 --> 4957.679
don't want to have anything to do with

4955.04 --> 4960.62
anything about this and now I have to

4957.679 --> 4962.9
avoid all these [ __ ] gay guys that

4960.62 --> 4965.48
think that they can get me

4962.9 --> 4969.4
and that's a nightmare

4965.48 --> 4969.4
and it has been ever since

4969.62 --> 4974.3
yeah and that's like

4972.02 --> 4976.34
what was it

4974.3 --> 4978.76
I think that's like 20 years ago when

4976.34 --> 4978.76
that happened

4983.36 --> 4985.78
right

4986.239 --> 4988.78
so

4990.38 --> 4993.7390000000005
just imagine like what that was like I

4992.78 --> 4996.08
was like

4993.739 --> 4998.0599999999995
just kind of assuming oh I'm gay because

4996.08 --> 5000.28
then I'm popular or something that was

4998.06 --> 5002.02
it yeah I was one of those [ __ ]

5000.28 --> 5003.219
idiots that's like I want to be more

5002.02 --> 5006.400000000001
popular

5003.219 --> 5008.32
or if I say I'm gay then these and these

5006.4 --> 5011.08
guys that look cool

5008.32 --> 5014.08
and they're rich and [ __ ] they suddenly

5011.08 --> 5017.159
want to hang out with me yeah that's the

5014.08 --> 5017.159
[ __ ] reason okay

5018.1 --> 5024.219
I couldn't even imagine finding another

5021.699 --> 5028.739
man or guy attractive

5024.219 --> 5033.2390000000005
I can't even imagine it attempting it

5028.739 --> 5036.5199999999995
literally initiate like throwing up

5033.239 --> 5039.959999999999
impulses you understand I'm not [ __ ]

5036.52 --> 5039.96
gay it can't be

5041.199 --> 5044.199
foreign

5045.3 --> 5049.360000000001
thanks for bringing that up clammy

5047.679 --> 5051.9
thanks a lot

5049.36 --> 5051.9
[ __ ]

5053.88 --> 5058.149
[Music]

5072.1 --> 5077.38
become rare people

5074.8 --> 5079.360000000001
well unless enough women are just like

5077.38 --> 5083.02
oh

5079.36 --> 5085.12
procreate with me I mean

5083.02 --> 5087.820000000001
the biggest problem is not even that

5085.12 --> 5090.46
there's not enough heterosexual men out

5087.82 --> 5093.099999999999
there the biggest problem is that women

5090.46 --> 5094.38
have become have been programmed to be

5093.1 --> 5097.780000000001
like

5094.38 --> 5100.78
exorbitly deranged

5097.78 --> 5104.0199999999995
like really [ __ ] deranged like and

5100.78 --> 5105.699
it's hidden inside a lot of it it still

5104.02 --> 5107.92
shines out if you have the eye for it

5105.699 --> 5110.08
you have the empathy like I do I can

5107.92 --> 5112.54
still see it but I mean

5110.08 --> 5116.44
there's women out there that just they

5112.54 --> 5118.84
don't they're not sensible anymore

5116.44 --> 5121.9
there's women out there that like to get

5118.84 --> 5124.32
at a really heterosexual gaze to break

5121.9 --> 5124.32
them

5128.8 --> 5133.900000000001
and a lot of like those same women go

5131.8 --> 5138.28
out with like really gross looking

5133.9 --> 5140.5599999999995
[ __ ] weenie boys that are [ __ ]

5138.28 --> 5142.54
yeah the [ __ ] get the beautiful women

5140.56 --> 5144.280000000001
and those [ __ ] women actually

5142.54 --> 5147.179
procreate with them because they're

5144.28 --> 5147.179
[ __ ] insane

5147.699 --> 5152.28
they're their range they think they're

5149.38 --> 5152.28
doing the right thing

5153.4 --> 5158.5599999999995
like they actually think they're doing

5155.56 --> 5160.25
the right thing which is like a tragedy

5158.56 --> 5165.120000000001
that knows no limits

piece of [ __ ] go [ __ ] yourself dude why

5196.9 --> 5199.62
uh God

nobody had to do that yeah yeah

5207.52 --> 5212.7390000000005
well yeah well maybe you weren't

5210.04 --> 5215.08
surrounded in a time with a lot of

5212.739 --> 5217.419999999999
Anguish for yourself maybe you weren't

5215.08 --> 5219.9
surrounded by people you thought were

5217.42 --> 5222.88
your friends that were continually

5219.9 --> 5225.699
convincing you that you were gay

5222.88 --> 5228.1
yeah maybe you didn't have that well

5225.699 --> 5229.299999999999
people that are in that position trust

5228.1 --> 5232.860000000001
me

5229.3 --> 5232.860000000001
they're gonna try it out

5233.62 --> 5237.3
it happens yeah

5237.52 --> 5243.76
teens and [ __ ]

5239.26 --> 5247.5
they get like peer pressured to do it

5243.76 --> 5247.5
you get it you [ __ ]

5248.32 --> 5253.739
that happens it's [ __ ] happening in

5250.48 --> 5253.739
my country right now

5258.04 --> 5265.239
yeah when I was younger

5260.94 --> 5267.5199999999995
they literally [ __ ] told me to my

5265.239 --> 5271.599999999999
[ __ ] face

5267.52 --> 5273.96
if you're not gay then you don't get

5271.6 --> 5273.96
power

5278.699 --> 5284.82
which is an injustice that cannot be

5282.28 --> 5284.82
measured

5288.46 --> 5295.36
that kindled a response that I could

5291.82 --> 5298.36
never show to the outside world

5295.36 --> 5301.299999999999
cause I wanted to [ __ ] torture those

5298.36 --> 5303.4
people to death that said that

5301.3 --> 5304.4800000000005
if I had a sword I chopped them in

5303.4 --> 5307.239
pieces

5304.48 --> 5309.638999999999
like with so much force that literally

5307.239 --> 5313.0
like their entire body would be cleaved

5309.639 --> 5315.719
in pieces okay I would be I'm so [ __ ]

5313.0 --> 5318.76
angry that that happened

5315.719 --> 5322.0
multiple times during my teams people

5318.76 --> 5324.9400000000005
told me if you're not gay you don't get

5322.0 --> 5327.54
power yeah that's what [ __ ] led up to

5324.94 --> 5327.54
that [ __ ]

5332.26 --> 5340.6
did I know any gay friends no I did not

5337.06 --> 5343.179
except for the Jesuit guy but I don't

5340.6 --> 5346.42
think he's just a psychopath

5343.179 --> 5348.34
doesn't really have any feelings anyway

5346.42 --> 5351.46
he doesn't care

5348.34 --> 5353.9800000000005
he's he was gay because

5351.46 --> 5355.54
that's what God hated that's literally

5353.98 --> 5357.879999999999
why he did that

5355.54 --> 5360.04
he doesn't have any feelings

5357.88 --> 5363.6990000000005
so

5360.04 --> 5365.5
and that's yeah against it for it he

5363.699 --> 5369.54
just does that because that's what a

5365.5 --> 5369.54
Satanist does and he likes to do that

5372.9 --> 5378.46
so no I did not know any gay people the

5376.239 --> 5382.5599999999995
only gay people I knew were friends of

5378.46 --> 5382.56
my mother through the music scene

5382.659 --> 5386.219
and they behaved

5386.98 --> 5391.718999999999
there was one gay man of friend of my

5390.699 --> 5395.5599999999995
mother's

5391.719 --> 5398.7390000000005
is really modest very well spoken but

5395.56 --> 5401.139
also very very gay

5398.739 --> 5403.839999999999
but I kind of was friends with him and

5401.139 --> 5406.42
like I I kind of liked him but yeah I

5403.84 --> 5409.12
mean he did find me attractive and that

5406.42 --> 5412.84
was annoying at times

5409.12 --> 5414.28
because I made it clear like no

5412.84 --> 5417.28
never

5414.28 --> 5419.8
I'll be your friend but never that like

5417.28 --> 5422.139
don't fantasize it don't allow yourself

5419.8 --> 5423.639
to fantasize because I can literally see

5422.139 --> 5425.9800000000005
that

5423.639 --> 5428.56
I told them all that it was just as

5425.98 --> 5430.659
straightforward with him back then like

5428.56 --> 5434.46
20 years around 20 years ago

5430.659 --> 5434.46
as I am now on my show

5440.38 --> 5445.6
and yeah

5442.48 --> 5447.699
but I mean I it was not attracted there

5445.6 --> 5451.719
but I did think it was a pretty

5447.699 --> 5454.419999999999
cool guy like he was a sympathetic dude

5451.719 --> 5458.02
and like he did like have a lot of

5454.42 --> 5461.92
empathy for life and other people it

5458.02 --> 5464.92
wasn't like a communist [ __ ] like that

5461.92 --> 5467.38
he was very reasonable and he was really

5464.92 --> 5471.06
reasonable Underneath It All not just as

5467.38 --> 5471.06
a veneer to seem civilized

5474.94 --> 5480.12
all right so yeah I've meant a couple of

5477.88 --> 5480.12
days

5482.679 --> 5485.159
foreign

5499.36 --> 5505.659
did my mom know I was straight

5503.44 --> 5507.58
I don't know what my mother thought of

5505.659 --> 5509.86
me

5507.58 --> 5511.54
dude I got into like freaking black

5509.86 --> 5515.86
metal

5511.54 --> 5515.86
I hung around with Psychopaths

5520.84 --> 5527.26
like I was like sort of into Eugenics

5524.739 --> 5530.32
even like I was pretty [ __ ] up in ways

5527.26 --> 5532.54
I don't know if my mother had like she

5530.32 --> 5537.239
lost friend dude she could barely

5532.54 --> 5537.239
[ __ ] keep oversight over her own life

5539.5 --> 5544.12
and she could not handle me at all and

5542.199 --> 5547.739
neither could my dad like none of them

5544.12 --> 5547.739
knew what to [ __ ] do with me

5554.139 --> 5558.639
I had just made a couple of Maneuvers in

5556.659 --> 5561.04
my development that they just did not

5558.639 --> 5563.4400000000005
see coming at all and they had no idea

5561.04 --> 5566.139
what to do with it

5563.44 --> 5569.44
they try to be like sort of a default

5566.139 --> 5571.42
liberal in response to it like oh you

5569.44 --> 5574.78
just got to be

5571.42 --> 5576.76
accepting and just just be okay with it

5574.78 --> 5579.4
and just say yeah just accept them for

5576.76 --> 5582.9400000000005
the but I mean I was like doing things

5579.4 --> 5586.78
on purpose for them to respond it's like

5582.94 --> 5589.9
hello what I'm doing now is wrong

5586.78 --> 5592.54
why aren't you getting angry and telling

5589.9 --> 5595.36
me off why aren't you showing me

5592.54 --> 5598.48
that you like are real on the inside

5595.36 --> 5601.719
that you're not a snuffed out

5598.48 --> 5605.5
faded little light

5601.719 --> 5608.679
and then they wouldn't respond

5605.5 --> 5611.92
and that got to me more got to me more

5608.679 --> 5614.62
that they did not respond because I

5611.92 --> 5616.719
wouldn't it just do things like that

5614.62 --> 5618.34
just to get a response every time I

5616.719 --> 5621.04
wasn't like oh trying to get into your

5618.34 --> 5623.9800000000005
nerd currently I just wanted to see that

5621.04 --> 5626.86
they had the light inside

5623.98 --> 5629.379999999999
this slide yeah that rage that genuinely

5626.86 --> 5632.139
like no

5629.38 --> 5636.4800000000005
[ __ ] off with this [ __ ] go away demon

5632.139 --> 5636.4800000000005
and they didn't do it ever

5638.46 --> 5644.679
there were times where I was literally

5641.5 --> 5649.62
praying that they'd get angry and slap

5644.679 --> 5649.62
me in the face and they wouldn't do it

5655.84 --> 5659.219
and afterward

5659.38 --> 5665.1990000000005
after all that was over and I kind of

5662.199 --> 5667.719
separated and they separate yeah I I

5665.199 --> 5670.9
made sure that they knew that I thought

5667.719 --> 5673.6
they were [ __ ] weak

5670.9 --> 5677.86
I literally like told them to their fish

5673.6 --> 5680.679
you're weak you're a coward you're

5677.86 --> 5685.5
spiritually inept

5680.679 --> 5685.5
told that to my mother's face

5686.02 --> 5691.84
told it to my father's father's face

5688.36 --> 5695.94
like you are weak and inept you don't

5691.84 --> 5695.9400000000005
even know what's happening with me

5697.3 --> 5702.219
and not oh you don't understand me but

5699.82 --> 5704.98
like no you are literally doing things

5702.219 --> 5709.62
incorrect because you don't understand

5704.98 --> 5709.62
what's happening with me you're scared

5710.52 --> 5719.38
and you're being weak about it

5715.199 --> 5722.28
why don't you guys respond to when I do

5719.38 --> 5727.32
something atrocious

5722.28 --> 5727.32
I literally [ __ ] told them

5728.38 --> 5733.679
and they still won't you do anything

5747.74 --> 5750.95
[Music]

5756.219 --> 5760.6
what the [ __ ] are you saying there I

5758.02 --> 5765.040000000001
can't read that

5760.6 --> 5769.38
damn it I hate that [ __ ] little thing

5765.04 --> 5769.38
no they did not split because of me

5770.11 --> 5773.339999999999
[Music]

5774.52 --> 5779.4400000000005
absolutely not

5776.92 --> 5781.7390000000005
they held together because it made it

5779.44 --> 5781.739
more

5782.62 --> 5789.159
I was acting as their relationship

5785.739 --> 5791.98
counselor when I was 15.

5789.159 --> 5795.28
yeah they did not split up because of me

5791.98 --> 5798.419999999999
or my behavior yeah that behavior

5795.28 --> 5798.42
came after

5798.48 --> 5803.32
they split up

5800.62 --> 5805.96
after my mother started to go [ __ ]

5803.32 --> 5811.0599999999995
insane and started to project her

5805.96 --> 5814.3
relationship issues with my dad onto me

5811.06 --> 5816.9400000000005
like accusing me

5814.3 --> 5819.2390000000005
of that [ __ ] like a [ __ ] insane

5816.94 --> 5819.239
person

5839.98 --> 5844.138999999999
they just let you be gay yeah

5846.82 --> 5851.159
I guess if you want to say it like that

5851.62 --> 5857.139
and it's intolerable

5854.56 --> 5860.8
it's absolutely intolerable that they

5857.139 --> 5863.7390000000005
did that like I am seriously and

5860.8 --> 5865.42
permanently angry I'm still angry at my

5863.739 --> 5867.459999999999
father for that

5865.42 --> 5869.9800000000005
although it's in the background because

5867.46 --> 5873.04
it can never be addressed I can only lay

5869.98 --> 5877.44
down the complaint at God when I'm dead

5873.04 --> 5877.44
like he did not do that

5877.9 --> 5885.94
you must get through to my dad you'll be

5882.699 --> 5887.98
dead by then as I am I get through and

5885.94 --> 5890.5199999999995
make sure that he knows that he did that

5887.98 --> 5890.5199999999995
wrong

5892.179 --> 5897.42
that they should have punished me

5897.52 --> 5903.6
that they should have forced me

5906.4 --> 5915.48
I wanted that I wanted it desperately my

5911.02 --> 5915.4800000000005
parents did not give me what I needed

[Music]

5929.32 --> 5932.4
hey Amanda you

5932.86 --> 5938.0199999999995
they sounded like narcissists narcissist

5938.82 --> 5944.199
narcissistic what

5941.199 --> 5944.199
nerested

5947.38 --> 5952.6
yeah you mean narcissist but that's

5950.26 --> 5956.159000000001
really spelled incorrectly there hello

5952.6 --> 5956.159000000001
Emmanuel good to see you by the way

5958.6 --> 5963.659000000001
but no they weren't narcissists they

5961.12 --> 5963.659
were just

5964.36 --> 5970.239
not capable of being a parent on the

5967.239 --> 5974.259999999999
level that it actually required to raise

5970.239 --> 5978.099999999999
a kid like me who is like three kids

5974.26 --> 5979.84
who goes farther and higher in all

5978.1 --> 5983.1990000000005
directions

5979.84 --> 5986.1990000000005
intellectually emotionally

5983.199 --> 5989.0199999999995
everything I was always [ __ ]

5986.199 --> 5990.28
concerned about the world like all the

5989.02 --> 5993.4800000000005
[ __ ] time

5990.28 --> 5993.48
just like I am now

5995.02 --> 5999.88
and even though I like didn't understand

5997.6 --> 6003.0
the things I would still be concerned

5999.88 --> 6005.46
with everything all the time

6003.0 --> 6007.98
but I would use it as a crutch as an

6005.46 --> 6010.38
Escapist crutch to not actually engage

6007.98 --> 6012.54
more in my own life because I felt so

6010.38 --> 6014.1
[ __ ] vulnerable every [ __ ] time

6012.54 --> 6017.04
everywhere

6014.1 --> 6018.780000000001
and always end up like oh just just get

6017.04 --> 6020.76
a job okay well just gotta get a job

6018.78 --> 6023.28
there oh guess what oh it seems like

6020.76 --> 6026.159000000001
okay and then a couple of guys happen to

6023.28 --> 6027.78
not like me very much and now suddenly I

6026.159 --> 6030.96
have to permanently deal with some

6027.78 --> 6033.9
stupid bully tension [ __ ]

6030.96 --> 6035.4
that really disrupts my growing ability

6033.9 --> 6037.5
and my focus

6035.4 --> 6040.799999999999
and I had to [ __ ] deal with those

6037.5 --> 6044.4
degenerates every [ __ ] where I went

6040.8 --> 6046.6990000000005
every [ __ ] job I tried every [ __ ]

6044.4 --> 6046.699

6050.219 --> 6054.5
everywhere the [ __ ] degenerates

6059.47 --> 6062.629
[Music]

6066.96 --> 6073.38
and I mean who's blaming him right I was

6070.38 --> 6076.139
dressing like a weirdo had weird mult

6073.38 --> 6078.719
like multi-colored

6076.139 --> 6081.6
hippie like clothing

6078.719 --> 6083.94
that kind of [ __ ] and spikies and I mean

6081.6 --> 6086.6990000000005
that's my [ __ ] fault but I mean I

6083.94 --> 6091.4
just was desperate to have any kind of

6086.699 --> 6091.4
identity like any kind

6091.62 --> 6095.28
and this was it this is like yeah I

6093.54 --> 6097.69
could do something with this this fits

6095.28 --> 6099.78
with my music

6097.69 --> 6102.178999999999
[Music]

6099.78 --> 6104.58
all that and then dude I didn't know

6102.179 --> 6108.06
what the [ __ ] I was doing man

6104.58 --> 6110.5199999999995
I hate it like suits and [ __ ] when that

6108.06 --> 6114.179
was exactly what I should have done

6110.52 --> 6116.820000000001
just like just go for the heart

6114.179 --> 6119.46
[ __ ] businessman and see everybody

6116.82 --> 6123.32
fall to their knees

6119.46 --> 6126.659
but nowhere to be a special artist type

6123.32 --> 6128.94
I'm hippie I'm an artist oh I'm so

6126.659 --> 6130.679
special I'm gonna be hippie and Gothic

6128.94 --> 6132.719
at the same time because they're

6130.679 --> 6135.4800000000005
incompatible but I could do it because

6132.719 --> 6140.4
I'm so [ __ ] special

6135.48 --> 6143.299999999999
idiot [ __ ] weak ass [ __ ]

6140.4 --> 6143.299999999999
hmm

6146.639 --> 6150.5
shut should have gotten a suit

6150.6 --> 6154.46
and like clothes that are like

6152.9 --> 6157.799999999999
absolutely

6154.46 --> 6161.28
absolutely ungay

6157.8 --> 6163.92
and then got out there and just [ __ ]

6161.28 --> 6165.119
get a [ __ ] job when I'm still [ __ ]

6163.92 --> 6167.9400000000005
young

6165.119 --> 6171.38
not get bullied all the time

6167.94 --> 6175.379999999999
but no I have to reveal away

6171.38 --> 6177.139
no I don't want to I don't want to do

6175.38 --> 6181.46
that

6177.139 --> 6181.46
I [ __ ] hate myself guys

6183.06 --> 6188.159000000001
like I regret almost every [ __ ]

6186.06 --> 6191.46
decision I made when I was a team like

6188.159 --> 6194.5199999999995
almost every single one

6191.46 --> 6197.82
all I've ever had memories of being

6194.52 --> 6199.9800000000005
proud for are still stupid useless

6197.82 --> 6201.659
[ __ ] ball base Theory

6199.98 --> 6203.638999999999
Theory I was so [ __ ] proud of that

6201.659 --> 6207.119
[ __ ] I thought it was better because of

6203.639 --> 6209.159000000001
that [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ]

6207.119 --> 6211.4
they're like that's the only [ __ ]

6209.159 --> 6211.4
thing

6213.5 --> 6220.56
why did I make those goddamn choices why

6216.719 --> 6224.96
did my parents just let me do that why

6220.56 --> 6224.96
weren't they forcing me

6231.42 --> 6237.32
did my brother give my parents a rough

6233.88 --> 6237.32
time no my brother like

6237.42 --> 6240.38
my brother

6241.679 --> 6247.08
is not like me he's like exactly the

6244.98 --> 6250.199
opposite in many ways

6247.08 --> 6252.619
and he just went out there and did

6250.199 --> 6252.619
everything

6253.44 --> 6256.799999999999
sport wise

6255.42 --> 6260.04
dude

6256.8 --> 6261.84
he had a job career he hated it in the

6260.04 --> 6264.84
end it was a program and he hated it he

6261.84 --> 6266.82
quit it because he just really hated it

6264.84 --> 6270.139
I get that hate part

6266.82 --> 6270.139
now he makes puzzles

6271.139 --> 6278.659000000001
and his wife is sad laboratory worker I

6276.119 --> 6278.659
don't know where

6279.6 --> 6282.8
and he's raising his kids

6283.139 --> 6288.179
and

6285.48 --> 6290.218999999999
my parents did not need to give my

6288.179 --> 6293.34
brother a rough time because he was

6290.219 --> 6296.179
always like an exemplary

6293.34 --> 6296.179
guy

6298.44 --> 6301.339999999999
a little bit

6302.1 --> 6306.659000000001
so no he did not give my parents a rough

6304.739 --> 6309.419999999999
time at all

6306.659 --> 6310.799999999999
although he was just not sympathetic I

6309.42 --> 6313.38
mean you can't have a car you couldn't

6310.8 --> 6315.78
have a conversation with my brother

6313.38 --> 6318.4800000000005
barely

6315.78 --> 6319.98
like as soon as any kind of emotions or

6318.48 --> 6323.04
something got involved he would

6319.98 --> 6329.119
immediately tap out

6323.04 --> 6329.119
so I was talking all the [ __ ] time

6329.219 --> 6335.52
I like we wanted exactly the opposite he

6333.119 --> 6337.0199999999995
never wanted to talk I always wanted to

6335.52 --> 6340.860000000001
talk

6337.02 --> 6343.320000000001
until everybody got sick of it

6340.86 --> 6345.679
so we were like extremely contrasting in

6343.32 --> 6345.679
that sense

6347.52 --> 6351.4800000000005
but no

6349.199 --> 6354.0199999999995
he did not give my parents a tough time

6351.48 --> 6354.0199999999995
at all

6354.48 --> 6360.959999999999
and in ways neither did I I mean I

6357.3 --> 6363.719
didn't like break things make a mess

6360.96 --> 6367.02
get into actual trouble with Outsiders

6363.719 --> 6369.96
that much as a as a pre-team I mean

6367.02 --> 6371.219
teens different but still I managed to

6369.96 --> 6373.679
stay out of trouble even though I was

6371.219 --> 6376.7390000000005
hanging around with blatant criminals

6373.679 --> 6379.56
at times I wouldn't do it myself I just

6376.739 --> 6382.259999999999
wanted to see it I just wanted to see

6379.56 --> 6384.119000000001
what was real out there I wanted to see

6382.26 --> 6387.360000000001
how far things went

6384.119 --> 6390.78
how [ __ ] up things really are

6387.36 --> 6393.179
how far people would just add a whim

6390.78 --> 6396.0
allow themselves to do something really

6393.179 --> 6399.38
[ __ ] up and just be okay with I wanted

6396.0 --> 6399.38
to see what was real

6404.34 --> 6409.639
okay

6406.26 --> 6409.639
okay hello

6411.12 --> 6416.43
[Music]

6413.159 --> 6419.7699999999995
hello Billy bars

6416.43 --> 6419.77
[Music]

6423.119 --> 6426.38
I was up with that

6432.54 --> 6436.219
what the [ __ ] is up with your videos

6445.86 --> 6451.04
all right

6448.26 --> 6451.04
so

6454.199 --> 6458.04
right I didn't give my parents a rough

6456.54 --> 6461.639
time

6458.04 --> 6462.96
I just made it too hard for them to help

6461.639 --> 6465.119
me out

6462.96 --> 6467.52
like I needed them to get really

6465.119 --> 6469.5
aggressive and break me break my

6467.52 --> 6472.619000000001
resistance and they just wouldn't do it

6469.5 --> 6474.719
they were too weak they were so [ __ ]

6472.619 --> 6477.0199999999995
weak that I could physically assault

6474.719 --> 6477.02
them

6477.239 --> 6482.58
and they wouldn't be able to do anything

6480.36 --> 6485.099999999999
because they were psychologically they

6482.58 --> 6487.5599999999995
just couldn't handle it anymore right

6485.1 --> 6488.46
because I wouldn't be physically violent

6487.56 --> 6490.38
really

6488.46 --> 6491.88
I didn't even have that impulse but I

6490.38 --> 6494.88
would just be unbreakable

6491.88 --> 6497.76
psychologically I would intellectually

6494.88 --> 6499.92
be ahead of the curve like with every

6497.76 --> 6503.6990000000005
[ __ ] sentence they said

6499.92 --> 6505.56
like I would be unbreakable guys

6503.699 --> 6508.339999999999
and like it didn't matter that I didn't

6505.56 --> 6510.54
understand things I would just

6508.34 --> 6513.96
interactively in the moment understand

6510.54 --> 6516.36
whatever I needed to do whatever I

6513.96 --> 6518.58
needed to know and understand to be

6516.36 --> 6522.299999999999
ahead of the curve of whatever they were

6518.58 --> 6525.48
doing in order to try to adjust me

6522.3 --> 6527.639
I was so unbelievably good at avoiding

6525.48 --> 6529.86
it that I couldn't get through to me and

6527.639 --> 6532.38
they gave up

6529.86 --> 6534.619
and that was like the worst moment in my

6532.38 --> 6534.619
life

6535.38 --> 6539.76
because I was desperate for them to

6537.719 --> 6542.1
break through to that to that system

6539.76 --> 6545.04
they needed to be stronger they needed

6542.1 --> 6547.02
to overcome me like viscerally and they

6545.04 --> 6550.98
didn't

6547.02 --> 6554.1
they tapped out because of weakness

6550.98 --> 6556.739
and that is kind of the thing in me that

6554.1 --> 6559.320000000001
really made me go over that satanic Edge

6556.739 --> 6562.98
and made me even at for a while think

6559.32 --> 6566.699
like this family deserves to die

6562.98 --> 6569.54
that was before my mother actually died

6566.699 --> 6573.599999999999
that did change everything

6569.54 --> 6575.94
made those feelings less ethereal

6573.6 --> 6577.26
and made me drop them because yeah I

6575.94 --> 6579.839999999999
mean if your mother really dies that

6577.26 --> 6582.84
does change everything

6579.84 --> 6585.360000000001
but I hated them for them for that for

6582.84 --> 6587.04
their weakness that they were always too

6585.36 --> 6589.92
weak to handle me

6587.04 --> 6591.3
like it's not fun you want your parents

6589.92 --> 6595.56
to be strong

6591.3 --> 6600.06
to be able to to to get to you I wanted

6595.56 --> 6602.280000000001
that I really really wanted that I

6600.06 --> 6603.4800000000005
literally told them to and they would

6602.28 --> 6605.699
just be like

6603.48 --> 6608.04
I don't know what to say

6605.699 --> 6610.44
dude my dad said that a couple of times

6608.04 --> 6612.6
where I was so [ __ ] furious I I

6610.44 --> 6615.96
wanted to punch him in the face so hard

6612.6 --> 6619.9400000000005
that he would literally break his skull

6615.96 --> 6619.94
so pissed off for his weakness

6630.719 --> 6635.4
a lot of anger man yeah we have a lot of

6633.659 --> 6639.0
intensity

6635.4 --> 6641.28
and I needed a lot of strength to forge

6639.0 --> 6642.9
that iron

6641.28 --> 6645.48
that iron

6642.9 --> 6649.92
and that carbon enriched iron that I was

6645.48 --> 6652.678999999999
I needed a hard Hammer to forge it I

6649.92 --> 6655.9800000000005
would literally describe it like that

6652.679 --> 6658.08
and they just wouldn't do it and they

6655.98 --> 6660.32
didn't know anybody that could do it

6658.08 --> 6664.679
because they were all hanging around

6660.32 --> 6669.78
liberal wussies and [ __ ]

6664.679 --> 6669.78
and women living with their dogs alone

6670.679 --> 6676.38
that was actually a nice girl with one

6673.8 --> 6679.56
but I mean

6676.38 --> 6683.04
they didn't they were not surrounded

6679.56 --> 6686.780000000001
with strength I was desperately looking

6683.04 --> 6690.119
for somebody that had real strength

6686.78 --> 6693.42
somebody that could immediately make me

6690.119 --> 6695.4
shock my [ __ ] mouth when I was being

6693.42 --> 6698.4
all wise ass

6695.4 --> 6701.58
that could actually make me shut up

6698.4 --> 6707.099999999999
I was desperately in need for somebody

6701.58 --> 6707.1
that could do that and there was nobody

6707.6 --> 6715.58
nobody was strong enough to do any of

6710.76 --> 6715.58
that they were all [ __ ] weak

6723.179 --> 6728.52
and it is partially what made me go to

6725.88 --> 6730.7390000000005
Satanist because at least they weren't

6728.52 --> 6732.84
that [ __ ] weak

6730.739 --> 6736.138999999999
the problem was they were weak in

6732.84 --> 6739.56
another way that was even worse

6736.139 --> 6742.1990000000005
took me long enough to find that out

6739.56 --> 6744.96
but at first it was a relief it's like

6742.199 --> 6748.799999999999
ah at least somebody that's never gonna

6744.96 --> 6750.06
respond a week in that sense against one

6748.8 --> 6755.4800000000005
another

6750.06 --> 6755.4800000000005
because they wouldn't act weak socially

6755.94 --> 6762.0
it would overall be completely insane

6759.36 --> 6764.339999999999
in ways but at least they didn't have a

6762.0 --> 6767.34
weak attitude toward one another

6764.34 --> 6771.96
and that that was the one [ __ ] thing

6767.34 --> 6776.179
that was so goddamn desperate for just

6771.96 --> 6776.179
don't be [ __ ] weak

6776.54 --> 6785.1
just don't be weak for the love of God

6782.52 --> 6787.679
and those were the only people that

6785.1 --> 6790.02
didn't have a [ __ ] weak attitude

6787.679 --> 6793.38
every [ __ ] time

6790.02 --> 6796.080000000001
problem was is that they had absolutely

6793.38 --> 6799.1990000000005
no connection

6796.08 --> 6802.199
to the real world in ways and had no

6799.199 --> 6804.0599999999995
sympathy whatsoever they they weren't

6802.199 --> 6807.299999999999
strong because you're supposed to be

6804.06 --> 6809.34
strong they were strong

6807.3 --> 6811.5
because it was a luxury that they could

6809.34 --> 6815.6990000000005
afford because they didn't really have a

6811.5 --> 6818.82
lot of moral burden resting on them

6815.699 --> 6820.619
they didn't have to contemplate like oh

6818.82 --> 6823.199
I gotta be weak because I don't want to

6820.619 --> 6827.36
hurt anybody now they were like no we're

6823.199 --> 6827.36
just strong we don't care what happens

6828.56 --> 6835.4400000000005
you die I die whatever the [ __ ]

6832.199 --> 6838.44
at least they weren't weak in social

6835.44 --> 6841.138999999999
interactions

6838.44 --> 6842.879999999999
and they would punish the weak verbally

6841.139 --> 6844.92
and I really appreciate that it's like

6842.88 --> 6846.96
somebody's acting like a stupid little

6844.92 --> 6849.78
[ __ ] [ __ ]

6846.96 --> 6851.28
and they would like really venomous

6849.78 --> 6854.28
tongue like

6851.28 --> 6856.8
like you're a weak piece of [ __ ]

6854.28 --> 6858.96
oh

6856.8 --> 6861.3
yeah

6858.96 --> 6863.46
in that sense yeah there's some

6861.3 --> 6866.1
behaviors that I literally took over

6863.46 --> 6868.679
from satanists

6866.1 --> 6872.34
because those were the few [ __ ]

6868.679 --> 6875.1
things that were actually good

6872.34 --> 6877.860000000001
but because of the wrong

6875.1 --> 6880.7390000000005
conditions because they had already left

6877.86 --> 6883.259999999999
they had already no more soul

6880.739 --> 6885.659
they were already Hellbound they were

6883.26 --> 6887.159000000001
obsessed with death and destruction in

6885.659 --> 6889.32
the end

6887.159 --> 6892.0199999999995
right and that was never going to go

6889.32 --> 6895.08
that way but at least they weren't

6892.02 --> 6898.820000000001
[ __ ] weak

6895.08 --> 6902.58
hate weak

6898.82 --> 6905.71
spiritually weak I hate it so much

6902.58 --> 6905.71
[Music]

6907.02 --> 6909.8
ah

6916.85 --> 6919.869000000001
[Music]

6924.0 --> 6927.54
but of course from another perspective

6926.1 --> 6930.719
they were

6927.54 --> 6932.699
much more weak because to them they were

6930.719 --> 6935.3
again they were strong because it didn't

6932.699 --> 6935.299999999999
matter anymore

6936.06 --> 6939.360000000001
because they had already lost everything

6937.739 --> 6941.638999999999
it was like

6939.36 --> 6943.679
you're holding in there to keep yourself

6941.639 --> 6946.08
in balance and honor all these things

6943.679 --> 6947.52
well they didn't they were just doing it

6946.08 --> 6949.199
because they could and they didn't

6947.52 --> 6952.8
really care because they'd already

6949.199 --> 6955.879999999999
thrown everything overboard basically

6952.8 --> 6955.88
so in that sense

6955.98 --> 6960.959999999999
it was more like a accidental side

6959.4 --> 6964.32
effect

6960.96 --> 6966.06
than a solid way of a principled solid

6964.32 --> 6969.719
way of doing things

6966.06 --> 6974.0
like I am trying to do with it

6969.719 --> 6974.0
I am driven by principle

6974.159 --> 6980.339999999999
they were driven by

6976.88 --> 6983.76
convenience because they didn't have

6980.34 --> 6988.02
those internal feelings anymore

6983.76 --> 6991.639
they could just do it out of efficiency

6988.02 --> 6991.639
had nothing that stopped them

7001.699 --> 7006.638999999999
vaingler yes streets of gold indeed

7010.36 --> 7014.54
did

7012.04 --> 7016.94
discovery of flatter drastically changed

7014.54 --> 7019.82
my life for the better

7016.94 --> 7023.119
that you can't really say that

7019.82 --> 7025.5199999999995
it changed everything and

7023.119 --> 7027.0199999999995
the difference is like Flat Earth every

7025.52 --> 7030.4400000000005
time it came up

7027.02 --> 7032.659000000001
was like a veil that gets lifted up

7030.44 --> 7034.699
you get to see a reality that you can't

7032.659 --> 7038.54
handle because it's so [ __ ] up and so

7034.699 --> 7042.138999999999
painful but at the same time at least

7038.54 --> 7044.659
you feel more you feel like you're

7042.139 --> 7047.38
more of a person more of a human being

7044.659 --> 7047.379999999999
more of a man

7047.96 --> 7052.639
so every time it would bring a lot of

7050.239 --> 7054.98
hurt because it's just like oh my God

7052.639 --> 7057.86
the world's so [ __ ] up

7054.98 --> 7060.44
but at the same time at least

7057.86 --> 7062.9
I would feel like

7060.44 --> 7064.82
but more and more I can handle this

7062.9 --> 7066.619
every time and I would still forget

7064.82 --> 7068.239
about it because there's nobody to talk

7066.619 --> 7071.0599999999995
to about it

7068.239 --> 7073.638999999999
but every time I would just know like I

7071.06 --> 7079.179
can actually handle this I can handle

7073.639 --> 7079.179
how unbelievably [ __ ] up this world is

7079.28 --> 7081.88
you

7087.02 --> 7091.179
so is that for the better

7093.32 --> 7100.219
it's just from confusion and like oh it

7098.179 --> 7101.84
could be anything I don't know oh there

7100.219 --> 7104.36
might be something creepy all there's

7101.84 --> 7106.58
bound to be good like ignorant

7104.36 --> 7109.54
enthusiastic

7106.58 --> 7109.54
a foolish

7109.76 --> 7113.84
that's one side not knowing and then

7111.86 --> 7116.598999999999
there's the other side that is

7113.84 --> 7118.219
shocked

7116.599 --> 7120.619000000001
nauseated

7118.219 --> 7122.92
overwhelmed

7120.619 --> 7127.119
but like

7122.92 --> 7127.119
elated as well

7127.219 --> 7132.619
so is that for the better

7129.98 --> 7135.98
you see is that actually for no it's

7132.619 --> 7137.659
just completely different

7135.98 --> 7141.58
and there are good things about it and

7137.659 --> 7141.58
there's also very bad things

7141.639 --> 7148.099
that will have a negative influence on

7144.92 --> 7148.099
you permanently

7148.58 --> 7153.619
that you don't get burdened by when

7151.099 --> 7156.52
you're still in that ignorant dream

7153.619 --> 7156.5199999999995
that's the difference

7165.679 --> 7172.0
how long did you come to realize it was

7168.679 --> 7172.0
flat and not globular

7173.9 --> 7178.219
well I actually believe there was both

7176.179 --> 7180.7390000000005
for a long time

7178.219 --> 7184.099
and it couldn't match it I was like no

7180.739 --> 7186.379999999999
it's a globe and it's flat at the same

7184.099 --> 7190.04
time like it's a globe in outer space

7186.38 --> 7191.599
and flat and enclosed at the same time I

7190.04 --> 7192.92
actually thought that for a while during

7191.599 --> 7195.56
my teens

7192.92 --> 7198.139
like is there a parallel reality where

7195.56 --> 7201.139
it's both flat and enclosed

7198.139 --> 7203.42
and a ball in outer space

7201.139 --> 7205.84
somehow

7203.42 --> 7209.719
how is that working is there like a

7205.84 --> 7212.360000000001
dimensional entanglement going on

7209.719 --> 7216.619
I had a whole bunch of weird

7212.36 --> 7219.139
hippie dippy sci-fi-ish ideas about it

7216.619 --> 7222.44
looping it I didn't really realize about

7219.139 --> 7225.92
looping until much later

7222.44 --> 7228.98
although I had seen hints of it

7225.92 --> 7231.619
in my vision when I was 17.

7228.98 --> 7233.36
but I got to see like a square and then

7231.619 --> 7236.48
a dotted

7233.36 --> 7239.9
dome which is obviously presenting like

7236.48 --> 7242.44
stars but it was like on a square and I

7239.9 --> 7242.44
was like oh

7244.88 --> 7250.159000000001
is that it is but I don't understand

7246.98 --> 7252.86
what I'm seeing but is that it

7250.159 --> 7254.78
is that actually the realm and that's

7252.86 --> 7258.98
later what I figured out like oh the

7254.78 --> 7261.259999999999
cube the cube of the realm

7258.98 --> 7263.119
and that eventually turned into the

7261.26 --> 7265.96
looping realization but that really

7263.119 --> 7269.0
happened around 2015.

7265.96 --> 7272.42
16. that's like the first time when I

7269.0 --> 7275.9
really actually realized it might be a

7272.42 --> 7277.639
looping system like that I never had the

7275.9 --> 7281.299999999999
hint before that

7277.639 --> 7283.82
I just couldn't understand that

7281.3 --> 7285.08
that a square could mean that it's a

7283.82 --> 7288.08
loop

7285.08 --> 7290.179
I never thought that before that moment

7288.08 --> 7292.84
I just didn't see that that it could be

7290.179 --> 7292.84
a possibility

7302.239 --> 7310.699
right but I mean even like when I was

7304.82 --> 7313.04
what is it around 14 15 in school

7310.699 --> 7315.5
I remember

7313.04 --> 7317.9
talking yeah this might be literally in

7315.5 --> 7320.06
a vision not in the in in class in the

7317.9 --> 7323.239
real world but I remember interfacing

7320.06 --> 7325.400000000001
with teachers which is really weird

7323.239 --> 7328.159
that I've like interacted with them

7325.4 --> 7329.9
separately in another in a dream

7328.159 --> 7332.96
Dimension and I think they even

7329.9 --> 7336.0199999999995
consciously knew that that had happened

7332.96 --> 7338.9
it's really weird guys [ __ ] Dark

7336.02 --> 7341.3
World stuff is really weird

7338.9 --> 7343.28
because some of the people that

7341.3 --> 7346.46
interface with you in the Dark World

7343.28 --> 7349.58
they know about it in the waking world

7346.46 --> 7351.38
that's the freakiest part right but they

7349.58 --> 7354.5599999999995
were the first ones and I think it was

7351.38 --> 7359.36
when I was 15 explained to me like no

7354.56 --> 7361.34
like the Horizon is refracted it looks

7359.36 --> 7364.46
flat but it's because the light is being

7361.34 --> 7366.56
bent away from the how it's spherical

7364.46 --> 7369.679
like and it's just bent into this flat

7366.56 --> 7370.9400000000005
plate so that's the first time

7369.679 --> 7373.3
like

7370.94 --> 7376.339999999999
that's the thing that kind of in my mind

7373.3 --> 7378.139
sealed the subject enough for me to

7376.34 --> 7380.0
really Let It Go

7378.139 --> 7383.42
it's like yeah

7380.0 --> 7386.3
when I was 15 in the Dark World my

7383.42 --> 7387.86
actual history teacher from there

7386.3 --> 7392.0
it's a woman

7387.86 --> 7393.199
told me in my dream

7392.0 --> 7396.199
that

7393.199 --> 7398.0
you know it's just fear because it looks

7396.199 --> 7400.4
so flat now I'm saying that in the

7398.0 --> 7403.04
context of the Elon Musk saying but

7400.4 --> 7405.46
that's effectively what she told me in

7403.04 --> 7405.46
my vision

7406.76 --> 7411.08
wait I'm pretty sure that she was in the

7409.52 --> 7414.320000000001
knowledge of that

7411.08 --> 7416.599
that that's happened that Vision that

7414.32 --> 7418.46
she did that in the real world afterward

7416.599 --> 7419.42
I think that she actually knew that she

7418.46 --> 7422.78
did that

7419.42 --> 7423.679
so it's it's really weird magic stuff I

7422.78 --> 7426.0199999999995
guess

7423.679 --> 7430.099
but she basically told me like no no it

7426.02 --> 7432.26
is a sphere it just it's bent

7430.099 --> 7434.06
it's bent into an apparent flat plane

7432.26 --> 7436.400000000001
it's like a challenge and I was like oh

7434.06 --> 7439.42
well that makes perfect sense

7436.4 --> 7439.42
it's a puzzle

7443.3 --> 7447.02
it's a very challenging point and I

7445.159 --> 7449.719
still believed in God the one thing that

7447.02 --> 7453.080000000001
no demon no vision

7449.719 --> 7455.96
thing no person could ever get out of me

7453.08 --> 7457.82
is the absolute default assumption that

7455.96 --> 7459.619
there is a God and that all things have

7457.82 --> 7461.299999999999
a reason

7459.619 --> 7463.46
and they would object to that I'd

7461.3 --> 7465.619000000001
believe anything but you could never

7463.46 --> 7468.38
convince me there was no God at any

7465.619 --> 7472.179
point I would always be like

7468.38 --> 7472.179
yeah that's that's gone

7472.28 --> 7477.619
but I was yeah there is fed

7474.92 --> 7479.2390000000005
I'm just continuing talking there was

7477.619 --> 7482.299999999999
definitely

7479.239 --> 7483.799999999999
for me just like oh yeah that makes

7482.3 --> 7486.619000000001
sense

7483.8 --> 7488.84
that's a challenge from God right the

7486.619 --> 7490.94
more I learn the more I realize how

7488.84 --> 7493.52
[ __ ] up reality is and that it must be

7490.94 --> 7495.379999999999
there for a reason it must be like that

7493.52 --> 7497.4800000000005
for a reason God is challenging us

7495.38 --> 7500.42
everywhere when we dive with our

7497.48 --> 7501.799999999999
intellect to find out what reality is we

7500.42 --> 7504.8
encounter

7501.8 --> 7507.5
surreal obstacles

7504.8 --> 7510.1990000000005
so it at the time I accepted that

7507.5 --> 7513.8
explanation in my dream

7510.199 --> 7517.159
yeah you know it's a sphere because it

7513.8 --> 7520.099
looks so flat because

7517.159 --> 7522.699
I saw it as a challenge from God to do

7520.099 --> 7526.96
that to us

7522.699 --> 7526.96
that's how I saw it at the time

7530.659 --> 7536.48
anyway I'm gonna run out the show this

7532.82 --> 7539.48
has been very intense show today lots of

7536.48 --> 7542.48
Vision stuff and oh my God climb me down

7539.48 --> 7544.759999999999
[ __ ] ask me about the gay thing again

7542.48 --> 7546.138999999999
I mean that is that is a bit of a red

7544.76 --> 7548.599
flag question

7546.139 --> 7551.06
trolls asked me that question trolls

7548.599 --> 7552.32
that are [ __ ] scumbags

7551.06 --> 7556.0
so

7552.32 --> 7556.0
don't do that again

7557.119 --> 7562.339999999999
it's on your record now

7559.699 --> 7564.199
anyway thanks everyone for coming

Donato yeah thank you so much for the

7599.42 --> 7603.08
PayPal donation like right away that was

7601.82 --> 7606.28
awesome

7603.08 --> 7606.28
really appreciate it

7607.639 --> 7614.06
I brought it up in

7610.099 --> 7615.92
known not really though clammy

7614.06 --> 7618.76
not really but I how do you even

7615.92 --> 7618.76
remember that

7621.739 --> 7628.638999999999
I don't know right it's fine just don't

7625.099 --> 7632.360000000001
bring that up again like you immediately

7628.639 --> 7634.52
get all the trolls all squirting please

7632.36 --> 7635.598999999999
that's the consequence when you bring it

7634.52 --> 7638.179
up

7635.599 --> 7639.860000000001
I don't like that anyway I'll be back to

7638.179 --> 7640.96
tomorrow with flat Earth early bird

7639.86 --> 7644.239
number

7640.96 --> 7645.619
1654 on a Saturday and I'm going to join

7644.239 --> 7647.299999999999
the flight of debates over at Nathan

7645.619 --> 7649.699
Oakley 9080 Channel which is already

7647.3 --> 7652.159000000001
started up I think

7649.699 --> 7654.259999999999
I think is it

7652.159 --> 7656.119
yeah

7654.26 --> 7662.02
anyway hope to see you there in the chat

7656.119 --> 7662.0199999999995
and until the next video keep it flat

7662.38 --> 7665.5
thank you

7666.54 --> 7669.0199999999995
