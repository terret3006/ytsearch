from right behind me is

88.0 --> 91.6
pretty damn gorgeous again

92.88 --> 97.6
seem to be a couple of trails up there

95.52 --> 100.39999999999999
though

97.6 --> 102.0
making it a little bit hazy but it's

100.4 --> 104.24000000000001
overall

102.0 --> 106.96
cloudless sky

104.24 --> 110.15899999999999
a lot of sun

106.96 --> 113.15899999999999
a mild breeze and it's it's pretty

110.159 --> 113.159
hot

115.92 --> 120.32000000000001
it's really really nice weather today

120.96 --> 127.96
it's probably gonna stay like that in

122.719 --> 127.96
the evening too as it was yesterday

131.84 --> 135.36
all right hello

133.28 --> 137.04
clutch

135.36 --> 140.31900000000002
bearless clutch

good to see you

147.36 --> 152.56
yeah yeah

149.52 --> 152.56
i know you told us

153.12 --> 157.12
that's all just fine yeah sorry for

155.04 --> 159.84
starting a little late i was very

157.12 --> 159.84
distracted

161.04 --> 164.72
yeah a new roommate

162.879 --> 167.92
came by

164.72 --> 170.56
with more furniture installing it

167.92 --> 173.35999999999999
and they have they brought this little

170.56 --> 175.2
doggie with them from home

173.36 --> 177.44000000000003
and it's like

175.2 --> 181.599
very close to like riley's dog except

177.44 --> 181.599
this one is like long hair the special

182.0 --> 186.319
anti-hair shedding species that you have

184.319 --> 189.67999999999998
to literally cut his hair but it's just

186.319 --> 189.67999999999998
such a cutie and he just

190.4 --> 194.8
i couldn't stop petting him

192.86 --> 197.8
[Laughter]

194.8 --> 197.8
uh

198.959 --> 204.48
anyway they're still working

201.92 --> 207.67999999999998
in the next room here uh

204.48 --> 210.159
hello from the grave

207.68 --> 212.72
does my roommate believe in flat earth i

210.159 --> 214.64
don't know

212.72 --> 219.319
i have no idea

214.64 --> 219.319
i haven't dropped any hints so far

226.56 --> 234.519
right so yeah it is

228.879 --> 234.51899999999998
sunday the fifth of september 2021

234.72 --> 238.159
and since i did start a little late i'll

236.799 --> 240.959
just

238.159 --> 243.92
continue on streaming a little longer

240.959 --> 246.31900000000002
at least fill an hour

243.92 --> 249.439
yeah yesterday's show

246.319 --> 249.439
it's pretty intense

249.92 --> 255.83999999999997
yeah now that you're mentioning it there

252.159 --> 255.84
wasn't any live ball busters

256.0 --> 258.56
there wasn't

259.04 --> 264.24
not even a premiere

261.44 --> 264.24
that was weird

264.88 --> 269.84
right but martin litke went live that

267.12 --> 269.84000000000003
was a lot of fun

274.24 --> 278.8
oh brian's logic

276.32 --> 280.56
had a couple of pretty good videos he

278.8 --> 282.88
made very short

280.56 --> 285.759
very effective

282.88 --> 285.759
somewhere in the night

287.44 --> 290.56
it was uh yeah that guy he stayed up

289.44 --> 293.759
very late

290.56 --> 295.84
it was on brandon's too

293.759 --> 299.36
uh but yeah check out brian's logic

295.84 --> 301.039
videos very short very mechanical about

299.36 --> 303.84000000000003
one is about

301.039 --> 305.44
gases effectively not having mass

303.84 --> 306.71999999999997
and it's something that i've been

305.44 --> 309.199
talking about

306.72 --> 310.72
more recently with more certainty

309.199 --> 312.639
because it's something that was kind of

310.72 --> 314.56
explained to me before but it was always

312.639 --> 316.479
kind of like what what what

314.56 --> 318.72
i don't really get it

316.479 --> 321.12
just like oh yeah it's tied into gravity

318.72 --> 323.44000000000005
or something so it's inappropriate that

321.12 --> 325.84000000000003
was like the extent of my understanding

323.44 --> 325.84
in like

327.199 --> 332.40000000000003
like since qe came onto the scene pretty

329.6 --> 334.24
much up until half a year ago and then i

332.4 --> 336.23999999999995
really started to get it

334.24 --> 339.36
and

336.24 --> 342.16
yeah so i explained that now too

339.36 --> 342.88
gas doesn't have mass and makes a bunch

342.16 --> 345.6
of

342.88 --> 347.919
ballers out there very triggered when i

345.6 --> 349.84000000000003
talk about that

347.919 --> 353.24
anyway

349.84 --> 353.23999999999995
hello tonoid

356.88 --> 360.84
call him

357.84 --> 360.84
what

367.039 --> 371.12
somebody said that martin luther was

369.36 --> 373.759
gollum what what are you talking about

371.12 --> 373.759
terminoid

377.68 --> 382.639
hey i don't get it

379.759 --> 382.639
but anyway

383.52 --> 385.75899999999996
uh

390.319 --> 393.96000000000004
what did i do

401.36 --> 406.96000000000004
oh yeah also had a very long call with

404.16 --> 408.96000000000004
rasta head again last night like up

406.96 --> 412.56
until way too late it's almost getting

408.96 --> 412.56
pissed off like damn it rasta

414.88 --> 418.96
it was a really good call though

417.12 --> 421.759
very intense

418.96 --> 423.84
like he's trying stuff out

421.759 --> 427.84000000000003
he's doing some serious spiritual

423.84 --> 427.84
exploring and we have a lot of like

430.88 --> 435.12
almost telepathic communication

433.52 --> 437.19899999999996
it gets a little annoying sometimes

435.12 --> 439.039
because it's so it becomes almost

437.199 --> 441.44
impossible to

439.039 --> 442.31899999999996
not interrupt one another because

441.44 --> 443.84
it's like

442.319 --> 446.16
you know someone one of us starts

443.84 --> 447.75899999999996
talking the other one immediately gets

446.16 --> 449.44
gets it

447.759 --> 451.36
and the funny thing is that might

449.44 --> 452.88
normally happen

451.36 --> 454.88
but it's like

452.88 --> 457.12
yeah

454.88 --> 460.08
you can't even argue about it we just

457.12 --> 462.88
we know it about one another

460.08 --> 465.84
it's it's funny

462.88 --> 465.84
but yeah doing some

466.0 --> 470.759
deep

467.759 --> 470.759
considerations

471.599 --> 474.96
is trying to figure things out

474.24 --> 477.84000000000003
like

474.96 --> 481.52
spiritual origins of religions and

477.84 --> 481.52
issues hey even that i talk about

484.4 --> 488.56
and he's been talking a lot about it

486.08 --> 492.4
apparently said that he had a long call

488.56 --> 494.72
with you too good servant

492.4 --> 497.039
right anyway that

494.72 --> 499.03900000000004
that was pretty much the last half of my

497.039 --> 501.68
day yesterday

499.039 --> 503.36
started at like 10 o'clock and ended up

501.68 --> 506.919
like being

503.36 --> 506.91900000000004
past three

509.12 --> 511.44
right

517.839 --> 521.719
many calls right

525.2 --> 528.44
that's good

537.6 --> 544.72
so right i am pretty much up for

541.2 --> 544.72
whatever you guys want to talk about

544.88 --> 550.64
pretty well rested

546.8 --> 550.64
got got lots of energy

555.2 --> 558.72
it's like even

556.08 --> 561.44
[Music]

558.72 --> 563.839
in the v situation out there there's

561.44 --> 564.85
just a lot of

563.839 --> 567.6
resistance and

564.85 --> 569.2
[Music]

567.6 --> 573.0400000000001
momentum building

569.2 --> 574.48
right momentum in a good way

573.04 --> 577.8389999999999
it's very yeah

574.48 --> 577.839
it's very exhilarating

583.519 --> 588.76
uh

585.76 --> 588.76
right

591.519 --> 594.9590000000001
so yeah bring it on

595.12 --> 598.519
i'm here

613.279 --> 619.8389999999999
oh from the grave what's today's topic i

615.68 --> 619.8389999999999
don't really have a topic

620.88 --> 624.64
but i yeah what yeah it could be any

623.44 --> 628.48
topic

624.64 --> 628.48
anyway hello one father unit

629.36 --> 632.36
blaboski

633.519 --> 637.519
considered it to be the same well

638.8 --> 644.8
that depends on the context though

642.56 --> 644.8
right

645.68 --> 648.959
i

646.48 --> 650.5600000000001
personally prefer the

648.959 --> 653.04
rudolf steiner

650.56 --> 655.279
spiritual cosmology

653.04 --> 656.959
where there's a distinct difference

655.279 --> 658.959
between

656.959 --> 662.2399999999999
the dark influences

658.959 --> 664.7199999999999
lucifer and ahriman although

662.24 --> 667.92
i have like debated this even with my

664.72 --> 667.9200000000001
healer and he said like

669.44 --> 677.12
ariman is kind of like a niche name

672.64 --> 677.12
but satan would do just fine

679.12 --> 684.0
but yeah luciferian influences are

682.079 --> 688.2399999999999
different though right and you know the

684.0 --> 689.6
difference by the spiritual nature of it

688.24 --> 692.24
and like

689.6 --> 694.64
what things can be attained

692.24 --> 696.64
from within that frequency

694.64 --> 698.24
like

696.64 --> 699.8389999999999
right and i've been talking about that

698.24 --> 702.839
right the difference between devils and

699.839 --> 702.839
demons

702.88 --> 705.279
anyway

708.079 --> 712.4799999999999
hester smith welcome to chat do you

710.079 --> 714.399
think gases have mass when they condense

712.48 --> 716.8000000000001
into liquid

714.399 --> 719.68
well not while they're gases but once

716.8 --> 722.88
they do condense into liquid yes they

719.68 --> 725.8389999999999
attain effective mass

722.88 --> 725.8389999999999
and gaining weight

728.079 --> 731.399
that's correct

733.6 --> 740.44
as as long as the material is in a

735.839 --> 740.44
gaseous state there is no mass

752.0 --> 756.639
oh yeah yeah sorry dude not today

757.519 --> 762.32
i think uh

759.839 --> 764.639
there's no more point in analyzing your

762.32 --> 766.88
behavior i've i've pretty much

764.639 --> 769.04
done anything i could

766.88 --> 773.8389999999999
so

769.04 --> 773.8389999999999
i'll have none no no more of that thanks

783.92 --> 789.1999999999999
lucifer bears knowledge that corrupts

786.639 --> 789.2
innocence

789.92 --> 794.4399999999999
yeah

790.72 --> 794.44
you could say that

801.6 --> 807.279
but lucifer is all about exploitation

804.8 --> 807.279
basically

808.24 --> 815.16
wow aroman is more about just erasing

812.16 --> 815.16
destruction

817.68 --> 820.6389999999999
but

818.56 --> 822.8
mechanically spirit mechanically in the

820.639 --> 824.48
root of steiner says this too and so

822.8 --> 826.8
does my healer

824.48 --> 830.0
like eventually if you give in to

826.8 --> 832.8
lucifer and the more you give in once

830.0 --> 834.48
you attain a certain level arimon will

832.8 --> 836.16
take over

834.48 --> 837.44
and there will be very little you can do

836.16 --> 840.7199999999999
about it

837.44 --> 843.839
it's actually very tough

840.72 --> 843.839
preventing that

844.399 --> 848.0
and

845.92 --> 849.279
yeah even without knowing those

848.0 --> 851.519
mechanics

849.279 --> 854.56
everybody does know that

851.519 --> 854.5600000000001
in in feelings

855.36 --> 860.88
right the devils on top playing their

857.76 --> 863.199
nasty games and doing blatantly immoral

860.88 --> 864.16
things but always under some kind of a

863.199 --> 866.0
cover

864.16 --> 867.92
everybody like knows yeah they're gonna

866.0 --> 868.88
eventually just stumble in what they're

867.92 --> 871.12
doing

868.88 --> 873.92
go overboard

871.12 --> 876.9590000000001
and lose grip and it all collapses

873.92 --> 879.68
that's iriman taking over from lucifer

876.959 --> 881.5999999999999
and everybody knows that everybody knows

879.68 --> 884.16
that that happens

881.6 --> 886.399
however they describe the mechanic you

884.16 --> 886.399
see

886.88 --> 889.36
anyway

895.6 --> 899.839
a full argon bottle

899.92 --> 905.68
it's heavier

902.24 --> 910.12
and slightly for one or really

905.68 --> 910.12
so if it is contained then

913.76 --> 918.3199999999999
well that still doesn't make it have

915.68 --> 921.12
mass though

918.32 --> 921.12
effectively

921.44 --> 926.5600000000001
right it it has a density and that

923.76 --> 929.68
density will be offset by the air really

926.56 --> 931.68
which is what mass is derived from it's

929.68 --> 934.399
based on air weight

931.68 --> 936.079
so if a gas contained perfectly

934.399 --> 937.279
contained is

936.079 --> 939.12
denser

937.279 --> 941.199
in its gaseous state

939.12 --> 944.639
then the surrounding air it's going to

941.199 --> 946.16
have some disequilibrium force exerting

944.639 --> 949.12
to the hole

946.16 --> 954.199
but that doesn't mean it effectively has

949.12 --> 954.199
mass it's relative density offset

964.16 --> 970.639
right the the weight extra

968.24 --> 974.0790000000001
shouldn't be

970.639 --> 974.9590000000001
in a linear correlation with the atomic

974.079 --> 977.04
mass

974.959 --> 979.3599999999999
see

977.04 --> 981.36
don't know this 100 sure but i think

979.36 --> 983.279
that that is

981.36 --> 985.12
it's something that came to me earlier

983.279 --> 987.759
thinking about it like yeah there is

985.12 --> 989.44
like apparent weight offset

987.759 --> 992.9590000000001
but is it

989.44 --> 995.6
accurate to the atomic mass

992.959 --> 999.92
probably not because the atomic mass is

995.6 --> 999.9200000000001
not really based on mass

1000.16 --> 1003.399
it's different

1013.92 --> 1019.5999999999999
can something be said to exist without

1016.48 --> 1019.6
mass yet of course

1019.759 --> 1025.1200000000001
still has other properties it still has

1021.839 --> 1028.48
has density right there is no material

1025.12 --> 1031.4389999999999
that does not have density in any state

1028.48 --> 1034.079
if it is material it has a density

1031.439 --> 1037.28
that is universal that is like

1034.079 --> 1038.6399999999999
universal applies to all matter all of

1037.28 --> 1039.52
it

1038.64 --> 1040.7990000000002
but

1039.52 --> 1042.72
mass

1040.799 --> 1045.6
is derived

1042.72 --> 1045.6000000000001
from density

1046.319 --> 1050.8799999999999
right from the effect of density in an

1049.36 --> 1054.3999999999999
environment

1050.88 --> 1056.96
in a container it's derived from that

1054.4 --> 1059.52
and things in gaseous state

1056.96 --> 1061.76
simply don't work you

1059.52 --> 1064.48
gas

1061.76 --> 1067.919
like weighed

1064.48 --> 1069.679
in as air weight well the

1067.919 --> 1071.1200000000001
the differential is going to be too

1069.679 --> 1074.3200000000002
small it's not going to really

1071.12 --> 1077.52
accurately represent the atomic weight

1074.32 --> 1077.52
that's my suspicion

1078.24 --> 1084.4
get out of here scum

1081.44 --> 1084.4
not today boy

1088.96 --> 1094.08
yeah no it's not just twice i'm gonna

1091.039 --> 1095.2
block you a thousand times if necessary

1094.08 --> 1097.52
because

1095.2 --> 1098.38
you're now just spamming and wasting my

1097.52 --> 1101.469
time

1098.38 --> 1101.469
[Music]

1101.52 --> 1105.76
i know that's what you already

1103.039 --> 1108.8799999999999
originally intended to do

1105.76 --> 1110.64
but yeah i can actually use

1108.88 --> 1112.0
people

1110.64 --> 1115.6000000000001
like that

1112.0 --> 1117.44
for psychoanalysis and that's what i do

1115.6 --> 1121.52
but i've already said anything i can

1117.44 --> 1123.44
about this particular troll

1121.52 --> 1127.08
and so i'm not just gonna let him fill

1123.44 --> 1127.0800000000002
up my chat anymore

1143.36 --> 1148.28
all right infinite loops lawson that's

1145.28 --> 1148.28
interesting

1162.16 --> 1164.64
okay

1163.039 --> 1166.48
i what

1164.64 --> 1169.5200000000002
a full gas bottle

1166.48 --> 1172.24
weighs more than a half full one

1169.52 --> 1175.6
right but look gas bottles typically

1172.24 --> 1175.6
using for welding

1176.4 --> 1181.679
for heat generation right gases

1179.12 --> 1184.6399999999999
they don't

1181.679 --> 1186.5590000000002
like if it's only gas

1184.64 --> 1189.44
in the tanker that's like nothing right

1186.559 --> 1191.9189999999999
so it's always compacted in there until

1189.44 --> 1193.3600000000001
it reaches liquid state and in its

1191.919 --> 1196.88
liquid state

1193.36 --> 1198.9599999999998
it does have mass you see

1196.88 --> 1201.6000000000001
so it's not actually the gas

1198.96 --> 1203.039
that weighs anything in that sense

1201.6 --> 1206.0
it's

1203.039 --> 1209.6
the gas condensed into liquid state and

1206.0 --> 1211.52
then it starts to attain weight

1209.6 --> 1215.559
because of the mass

1211.52 --> 1215.559
because it is a liquid now

1237.28 --> 1239.52
yeah

1240.0 --> 1244.4
right but yeah infinite loops loss and

1241.919 --> 1246.159
i've worked i'm uh i've been a

1244.4 --> 1249.2
practicing goldsmith

1246.159 --> 1250.7990000000002
haven't done it in a while but yeah i've

1249.2 --> 1254.4
worked with

1250.799 --> 1256.32
gas pressurized gas bottles as well

1254.4 --> 1257.44
for soldering

1256.32 --> 1260.24
and

1257.44 --> 1262.0
yeah melting metals to cast them and all

1260.24 --> 1265.559
that so yeah i've had some experience

1262.0 --> 1265.559
with it as well

1276.64 --> 1282.24
intermolecular bonds is what gives us

1279.52 --> 1284.4
mass yeah yeah

1282.24 --> 1287.64
that seems about right

1284.4 --> 1287.64
good servant

1293.76 --> 1296.76
so

1317.52 --> 1319.84
what

1325.6 --> 1330.7199999999998
i've never heard of that one infinite

1327.52 --> 1330.72
loops lawson serious

1330.88 --> 1333.8400000000001
how does that work

1335.6 --> 1342.0
i've never heard of that

1338.48 --> 1343.3600000000001
not that i typically like to work

1342.0 --> 1346.159
with like

1343.36 --> 1349.6789999999999
gas and soldering with greasy hands mind

1346.159 --> 1349.679
you but i've never heard of that

1353.28 --> 1357.76
the wind blows your roof off can it be

1355.2 --> 1359.1200000000001
said to have mass well your roof has

1357.76 --> 1362.1589999999999
mass

1359.12 --> 1366.1589999999999
and gas pressure differential which we

1362.159 --> 1368.4
know as wind definitely exerts force

1366.159 --> 1370.159
right it exerts force it just doesn't

1368.4 --> 1373.44
have any mass at it

1370.159 --> 1376.48
equalizes very quickly

1373.44 --> 1378.64
right the wind doesn't have mass

1376.48 --> 1382.32
but it can exert pressure

1378.64 --> 1383.76
against solid objects and even liquid

1382.32 --> 1386.72
and thereby

1383.76 --> 1386.72
insert a force

1387.679 --> 1390.72
and that force can then rip your roof

1389.76 --> 1394.48
off

1390.72 --> 1394.48
right because your roof has mass

1396.0 --> 1402.24
but the wind itself doesn't you don't

1398.32 --> 1406.36
need mass to exert pressure

1402.24 --> 1406.36
it's actually not that relevant

1421.919 --> 1425.3600000000001
hmm

1423.36 --> 1429.9599999999998
okay infinite loops loss and i i've

1425.36 --> 1429.9599999999998
never seen one of those videos

1432.72 --> 1437.679
i know that anything fire related even

1435.279 --> 1440.4
just the spark

1437.679 --> 1443.52
is pretty damn dangerous if you

1440.4 --> 1447.52
yeah expose pure oxygen to it

1443.52 --> 1447.52
that that is the thing that i do know

1457.039 --> 1461.279
yeah air is the curse of man but i'm not

1459.12 --> 1463.6
talking about

1461.279 --> 1468.0
that specifically

1463.6 --> 1472.6
i'm not talking about a specific entity

1468.0 --> 1472.6
when i talk about satan and lucifer

1476.88 --> 1482.4
like in general i consider satan not so

1479.44 --> 1484.159
much as a spiritual entity as just more

1482.4 --> 1485.52
like a

1484.159 --> 1487.279
a force

1485.52 --> 1490.559
a force of nature

1487.279 --> 1493.679
within the design of the spirit

1490.559 --> 1498.52
or rather externally

1493.679 --> 1498.52
influencing the design of the spirit

1500.32 --> 1506.3999999999999
and yeah those spirits may have at some

1503.919 --> 1508.0800000000002
point just be embodied

1506.4 --> 1510.159
by an entity

1508.08 --> 1512.32
but that doesn't mean that

1510.159 --> 1514.64
it is the entity it just means that the

1512.32 --> 1516.559
entity kind of like perfectly channeled

1514.64 --> 1520.3200000000002
that frequency at that but that's how i

1516.559 --> 1520.32
see that's even how i see jesus

1520.4 --> 1526.0
it just embodied the perfect frequency

1523.76 --> 1528.1589999999999
for the first time like that or maybe

1526.0 --> 1531.44
not for the first time but

1528.159 --> 1531.44
a registered time

1533.36 --> 1538.0
with a lasting impact despite everything

1536.32 --> 1541.3999999999999
that's been done

1538.0 --> 1541.4
with his legacy

1553.44 --> 1557.919
okay one further unit that's very dark

1556.48 --> 1561.52
dude

1557.919 --> 1561.5200000000002
i wouldn't dwell on it too much

1564.32 --> 1568.32
but it is

1565.76 --> 1572.0
interesting to conceive even in spirit

1568.32 --> 1574.559
mechanics that it is devils that are

1572.0 --> 1578.559
really in control not demons because

1574.559 --> 1578.559
demons only destroy things

1579.52 --> 1583.279
but because of the

1581.12 --> 1584.559
attainment of power and insight and

1583.279 --> 1586.64
control

1584.559 --> 1591.039
the spirit of devils

1586.64 --> 1591.039
will kind of naturally flow to the top

1592.0 --> 1598.64
even whether they like it or not

1594.48 --> 1601.279
that's something that i have considered

1598.64 --> 1603.2
right and that might actually fit

1601.279 --> 1605.52
well the

1603.2 --> 1606.88
metaphysical metaphor of what you just

1605.52 --> 1609.6
said

1606.88 --> 1611.2
in command of the kernel world right but

1609.6 --> 1614.0
the way you said it the luciferious

1611.2 --> 1616.64
command of the colonel ward

1614.0 --> 1619.2
typically that would be envisioned when

1616.64 --> 1621.44
you say it like that as some kind of a

1619.2 --> 1623.8400000000001
specific entity

1621.44 --> 1625.3600000000001
the red man with the horns and

1623.84 --> 1628.08
the goat hooves

1625.36 --> 1632.32
sitting on some physical thrones thrown

1628.08 --> 1632.32
somewhere right ruling the world well

1632.799 --> 1638.039
that is a little bit over exit

1634.64 --> 1640.88
terrorized that's exoteric that is like

1638.039 --> 1643.12
iconization i see it more as energy

1640.88 --> 1646.64
mechanics

1643.12 --> 1648.7199999999998
and that's what i try to touch upon

1646.64 --> 1649.6000000000001
when i talk about these things rather

1648.72 --> 1652.3990000000001
than

1649.6 --> 1655.84
icons that have been conjured by people

1652.399 --> 1655.84
in response to that information

1658.0 --> 1663.52
satan is the astral [ __ ]

1661.36 --> 1666.52
george sanford that's just

1663.52 --> 1666.52
no

1672.08 --> 1676.52
right clutch logos in the flesh yeah the

1674.96 --> 1678.32
the perfect

1676.52 --> 1681.279
manifestation

1678.32 --> 1682.48
of that spiritual frequency

1681.279 --> 1685.039
and all the

1682.48 --> 1687.6
the rewards that come with it

1685.039 --> 1690.1589999999999
for being there

1687.6 --> 1693.48
and the toll

1690.159 --> 1693.48
all of it

1728.08 --> 1733.6789999999999
the devil was cast out

1730.399 --> 1736.8799999999999
well the devil and in that context when

1733.679 --> 1739.76
when you can say like an entity is

1736.88 --> 1742.88
fallen not allowed into heaven anymore

1739.76 --> 1742.8799999999999
what does that really mean

1743.12 --> 1745.4399999999998
right

1746.399 --> 1750.9599999999998
that

1747.679 --> 1753.44
refers more to a demonic effect right

1750.96 --> 1757.1200000000001
the cutting off

1753.44 --> 1759.1200000000001
if you cut yourself off from god from

1757.12 --> 1760.6399999999999
the recognition of that and the truth

1759.12 --> 1762.799
and the methods

1760.64 --> 1765.6000000000001
then you become demonic and then yeah

1762.799 --> 1767.36
then literally by those actions by those

1765.6 --> 1769.6789999999999
choices

1767.36 --> 1771.36
you are cut off from heaven you don't

1769.679 --> 1773.44
even understand it anymore and

1771.36 --> 1775.36
eventually you won't even you you'll

1773.44 --> 1778.48
think you won't even want it anymore

1775.36 --> 1781.4799999999998
that's when you're fully possessed

1778.48 --> 1781.48
right

1798.08 --> 1801.84
right but dude that's just

1800.799 --> 1805.039
that is

1801.84 --> 1808.24
iconizing what you describe is very well

1805.039 --> 1811.919
repeated right but it is iconography it

1808.24 --> 1815.039
is an iconization a visualization

1811.919 --> 1817.5200000000002
that actually represents a metaphysical

1815.039 --> 1821.44
truth a mechanic

1817.52 --> 1824.24
in the spirit i believe right

1821.44 --> 1826.0
like even if it was absolutely literal

1824.24 --> 1828.24
how is it

1826.0 --> 1829.76
relevant and relatable

1828.24 --> 1832.48
to the direct

1829.76 --> 1835.84
icon to the direct

1832.48 --> 1837.919
acceptance of a literal event right how

1835.84 --> 1841.039
is that relevant to anything not so much

1837.919 --> 1842.88
right but the metaphor you get out of it

1841.039 --> 1844.0
that is something that carries through

1842.88 --> 1846.279
so it is

1844.0 --> 1848.0
the way you said it is a well-known

1846.279 --> 1851.039
iconization

1848.0 --> 1853.679
of a metaphysical process that i by the

1851.039 --> 1857.679
way also just described

1853.679 --> 1860.0800000000002
in metaphysical mechanics

1857.679 --> 1862.48
you see

1860.08 --> 1865.36
because that look not everybody gets

1862.48 --> 1867.6
esoterics a lot of people don't how do

1865.36 --> 1869.6
you then

1867.6 --> 1872.0
carry on the knowledge

1869.6 --> 1874.24
when nobody understands it by creating

1872.0 --> 1875.919
icons out of it by presenting it in a

1874.24 --> 1878.559
way it's like a bardic tradition the

1875.919 --> 1881.2
parts were very good at that

1878.559 --> 1884.24
making a story out of information in a

1881.2 --> 1886.799
way that would grip people's imagination

1884.24 --> 1889.679
on the archaic level so that they would

1886.799 --> 1891.279
remember the icons even if they at some

1889.679 --> 1893.6000000000001
point would completely lose the

1891.279 --> 1896.64
understanding of it if they just passed

1893.6 --> 1898.559
on the tradition through the icons

1896.64 --> 1901.2
then eventually

1898.559 --> 1903.36
somebody in the next generation at some

1901.2 --> 1906.64
point would wake up

1903.36 --> 1909.279
and start to see the esoterics that were

1906.64 --> 1911.2
always in it because they were supposed

1909.279 --> 1912.559
to be in it because that's why it was

1911.2 --> 1915.44
designed

1912.559 --> 1918.6
to carry through ignorant times

1915.44 --> 1918.6000000000001
you see

1923.36 --> 1926.799
right like a really

1925.679 --> 1928.72
basic

1926.799 --> 1930.96
person that's

1928.72 --> 1933.3600000000001
just not very intellectually curious and

1930.96 --> 1935.519
all that you can't make them understand

1933.36 --> 1937.6789999999999
spiritual things

1935.519 --> 1940.88
but you can just like

1937.679 --> 1943.1200000000001
show them a little story

1940.88 --> 1944.88
a couple of statues maybe and then just

1943.12 --> 1946.8799999999999
tell the story well they might

1944.88 --> 1950.3200000000002
definitely remember that because it's

1946.88 --> 1952.5590000000002
like easy as if you were

1950.32 --> 1955.039
trying to teach a kid right they'll

1952.559 --> 1956.96
remember it they might never learn to

1955.039 --> 1959.2
truly understand its

1956.96 --> 1961.44
its esoteric essence but they will

1959.2 --> 1965.519
remember it right right

1961.44 --> 1966.88
and that's kind of been very important

1965.519 --> 1970.48
because

1966.88 --> 1973.1200000000001
the wise ones of our far past knew about

1970.48 --> 1975.44
the cycles knew about the cycles where

1973.12 --> 1975.4399999999998
people

1975.6 --> 1980.7199999999998
all of them a lot of them would reach a

1977.919 --> 1982.5590000000002
peak in consciousness would ascend

1980.72 --> 1983.919
and understand all kinds of things that

1982.559 --> 1986.32
were always there

1983.919 --> 1988.64
but then after a while other things

1986.32 --> 1992.48
happen the tide turns and they would

1988.64 --> 1992.48
lose it or the the peak

1993.6 --> 1999.279
ascended ones would like die eventually

1996.64 --> 2000.64
or something would happen

1999.279 --> 2002.96
and then

2000.64 --> 2005.6000000000001
the shock of it would literally

2002.96 --> 2009.1200000000001
extinguish that flame

2005.6 --> 2011.279
and then people become ignorant again

2009.12 --> 2012.32
and

2011.279 --> 2014.0
right

2012.32 --> 2016.84
in their ignorance

2014.0 --> 2020.159
the esoteric insight would be

2016.84 --> 2022.8799999999999
lost but it would still be stored in the

2020.159 --> 2025.88
iconography

2022.88 --> 2025.88
right

2035.36 --> 2039.039
it's all about how do you

2040.96 --> 2044.159
how do you

2041.58 --> 2046.6399999999999
[Music]

2044.159 --> 2048.7200000000003
express knowledge in a way that will

2046.64 --> 2052.399
carry through time

2048.72 --> 2052.399
far beyond your own lifetime

2057.04 --> 2059.359
right

2059.76 --> 2063.8790000000004
anyway let's get back to chat

2084.399 --> 2091.52
okay well everything you just described

2087.679 --> 2091.52
is literally metaphysical

2096.56 --> 2100.72
wearing the armor of god

2099.119 --> 2103.839
literally

2100.72 --> 2103.839
how is that literal

2105.599 --> 2110.2400000000002
so you seem to be entangling

2108.88 --> 2113.28
literalism

2110.24 --> 2116.9199999999996
iconography with metaphysics there are

2113.28 --> 2116.92
riskers man

2134.56 --> 2136.96
faith

2137.44 --> 2139.76
oh

2142.839 --> 2149.92
really faith sounds pretty damn

2147.04 --> 2152.72
not physically literal to me

2149.92 --> 2155.28
is per definition

2152.72 --> 2158.48
in the experience

2155.28 --> 2160.32
it is information it is the conscious

2158.48 --> 2162.96
choice of

2160.32 --> 2164.4
trusting and dwelling and

2162.96 --> 2166.48
acting

2164.4 --> 2168.2400000000002
right how is that

2166.48 --> 2171.68
physically literal how is that

2168.24 --> 2173.04
physically literal and armor

2171.68 --> 2176.7999999999997
isn't

2173.04 --> 2176.8
it's about the spirit mechanics

2178.0 --> 2183.68
metaphysical

2180.16 --> 2187.3999999999996
spirit mechanics are not physical just

2183.68 --> 2187.3999999999996
to clear that up

2187.92 --> 2194.0
it's supernatural it physically falls

2190.96 --> 2197.04
under the category of supernatural

2194.0 --> 2197.04
spirit mechanics

2198.8 --> 2206.0
and it arguably comes from god

2202.079 --> 2206.0
right just like all the information

2219.68 --> 2223.24
hey john john

2243.04 --> 2246.48
sound

2244.16 --> 2246.48
what

2246.56 --> 2250.52
sounds should be just fine

2263.68 --> 2266.68
uh

2288.96 --> 2293.76
yeah well aries the curse of man

2292.16 --> 2296.3999999999996
no

2293.76 --> 2296.4
that that's

2296.8 --> 2302.0
i don't know what trainer thought you're

2298.88 --> 2306.079
on but that's just wrong

2302.0 --> 2306.079
right doesn't protect you from the devil

2306.56 --> 2313.119
may protect you from satan from darkness

2311.52 --> 2314.4
from death

2313.119 --> 2315.28
erosion

2314.4 --> 2316.4
right

2315.28 --> 2318.0
but

2316.4 --> 2321.04
the devil

2318.0 --> 2322.32
is very very capable of seducing you

2321.04 --> 2324.72
while you

2322.32 --> 2329.119
have faith

2324.72 --> 2329.1189999999997
trust and not understanding

2330.0 --> 2334.48
right you might be thinking you're doing

2331.92 --> 2336.56
the right thing it might all work out by

2334.48 --> 2338.079
your knowledge but yeah

2336.56 --> 2341.359
devil's

2338.079 --> 2343.6800000000003
lucifer doesn't really give a [ __ ]

2341.359 --> 2344.88
they have their own

2343.68 --> 2346.64
insights

2344.88 --> 2347.92
and they still know how to trick you and

2346.64 --> 2350.64
corrupt you

2347.92 --> 2352.839
right you may think you're safe but

2350.64 --> 2358.3199999999997
you're not

2352.839 --> 2358.32
safe only safe if you are vigilant

2358.64 --> 2363.359
of all

2360.4 --> 2365.359
misunderstanding and if you are aware

2363.359 --> 2368.3199999999997
that

2365.359 --> 2370.24
you will always bump into things that

2368.32 --> 2372.96
you've taken for granted that turn out

2370.24 --> 2372.9599999999996
to be false

2373.839 --> 2377.7599999999998
and once you understand that it's not

2375.839 --> 2379.52
relevant whether you believe something

2377.76 --> 2382.8
is false or not

2379.52 --> 2386.0
it is the actions that come from

2382.8 --> 2386.0
whatever you believe

2386.079 --> 2388.96
that really matters

2390.8 --> 2394.88
that's another type of faith that's

2392.72 --> 2398.48
another way to describe what faith could

2394.88 --> 2398.48
be and in my opinion should be

2399.119 --> 2402.7200000000003
it's trust in the design

2404.319 --> 2411.119
trust in what you don't know now but you

2407.92 --> 2412.8
know you will know and you might even

2411.119 --> 2414.6400000000003
know how

2412.8 --> 2419.8
you will know and what that will be like

2414.64 --> 2419.7999999999997
even though you don't know at the time

2429.04 --> 2431.68
the devil

2431.76 --> 2436.6400000000003
no it's a spirit clutch

2434.24 --> 2438.8799999999997
i'm talking metaphysics i'm not talking

2436.64 --> 2441.2
about entities walking around in this

2438.88 --> 2442.0
world i'm not talking cosmogeny right

2441.2 --> 2445.68
now

2442.0 --> 2445.68
i'm talking spirit mechanics

2448.72 --> 2453.72
things that we deal with as mankind

2469.94 --> 2474.7490000000003
[Music]

2476.94 --> 2482.64
[Music]

2478.839 --> 2483.839
right it's just my own personal rule of

2482.64 --> 2486.16
fist

2483.839 --> 2486.96
faith

2486.16 --> 2490.56
is

2486.96 --> 2492.56
a preliminary necessity right you got to

2490.56 --> 2494.48
have faith in order to learn to

2492.56 --> 2496.72
understand something

2494.48 --> 2498.64
because if you have no faith in it then

2496.72 --> 2500.9599999999996
why would you engage to try and

2498.64 --> 2502.96
understand it

2500.96 --> 2505.119
but faith is not the thing you should

2502.96 --> 2508.0
end up with

2505.119 --> 2510.079
right there might always be new things

2508.0 --> 2511.44
to engage with

2510.079 --> 2513.6800000000003
but it

2511.44 --> 2516.0
with every thing

2513.68 --> 2518.16
you deal with it should not be the thing

2516.0 --> 2520.319
you end up with you should be ending up

2518.16 --> 2523.1189999999997
with understanding

2520.319 --> 2525.2799999999997
that's where i make my mark

2523.119 --> 2526.2400000000002
of different interpretation even of the

2525.28 --> 2528.079
entire

2526.24 --> 2531.52
jesus legacy

2528.079 --> 2531.52
it's about understanding

2532.079 --> 2536.88
faith comes before understanding if

2534.88 --> 2538.2400000000002
understanding isn't reached

2536.88 --> 2539.52
then faith

2538.24 --> 2541.5989999999997
becomes

2539.52 --> 2543.44
ignorance

2541.599 --> 2544.8
then you don't understand what you're

2543.44 --> 2546.48
doing yeah you might have faith you

2544.8 --> 2548.4
might carry through you might even feel

2546.48 --> 2553.119
very good about it

2548.4 --> 2555.6800000000003
but you don't understand

2553.119 --> 2558.2400000000002
exorcisms are yeah i know aries the

2555.68 --> 2560.64
curse of man i i perform them i know

2558.24 --> 2563.359
they're real

2560.64 --> 2564.64
i know it's all real aries

2563.359 --> 2566.56
i'm just

2564.64 --> 2569.52
not talking

2566.56 --> 2570.88
in the same train of thinking

2569.52 --> 2573.28
as you are

2570.88 --> 2575.599
right i'm not concerned

2573.28 --> 2577.6800000000003
by exoterics right now

2575.599 --> 2580.0
and priestly traditions i'm talking

2577.68 --> 2583.96
about spirit mechanics

2580.0 --> 2583.96
things that apply always

2610.319 --> 2612.56
yeah

2612.96 --> 2617.76
and hey if you are fully possessed

2616.079 --> 2619.44
then

2617.76 --> 2623.28
you think that it's

2619.44 --> 2625.44
like a miracle that you would claim

2623.28 --> 2627.3590000000004
that you would even go to the point as

2625.44 --> 2629.52
to be claiming

2627.359 --> 2631.119
to be satan himself

2629.52 --> 2632.8
and even

2631.119 --> 2635.44
showing off

2632.8 --> 2637.52
bizarre things that the person in their

2635.44 --> 2642.079
normal state of mind would know

2637.52 --> 2642.079
in order to bluff that extra

2642.48 --> 2646.64
it's easier than you might think aries

2644.88 --> 2648.2400000000002
the curse of man

2646.64 --> 2650.56
doesn't mean that they're not possessed

2648.24 --> 2651.5989999999997
though

2650.56 --> 2654.0789999999997
right

2651.599 --> 2658.0
but i talked about possession

2654.079 --> 2658.0
a lot in the last two shows

2658.24 --> 2663.839
that wasn't just an isolated story no

2661.359 --> 2667.2799999999997
that absolutely fits in everything else

2663.839 --> 2667.2799999999997
that i'm talking about right now

2671.68 --> 2674.3999999999996
no

2672.48 --> 2677.28
no aries

2674.4 --> 2678.92
it doesn't you're wrong

2677.28 --> 2683.76
it requires

2678.92 --> 2686.64
understanding it doesn't require faith

2683.76 --> 2686.6400000000003
it's ridiculous

2687.92 --> 2692.4
i mean it could work with faith

2691.119 --> 2695.6800000000003
it could

2692.4 --> 2699.599
depends on the exorcist

2695.68 --> 2702.3999999999996
and the the one being exercised

2699.599 --> 2704.1600000000003
but in general it is it is not the faith

2702.4 --> 2706.64
the faith is the straw man it is the

2704.16 --> 2708.7999999999997
knowledge it is the taking serious of

2706.64 --> 2711.359
the knowledge

2708.8 --> 2713.599
that was presented to you and then using

2711.359 --> 2715.5989999999997
it as a guide

2713.599 --> 2719.04
for your principles

2715.599 --> 2720.56
and for your actions

2719.04 --> 2723.2
right and it

2720.56 --> 2724.72
why would you have faith in that when

2723.2 --> 2728.64
you know

2724.72 --> 2728.64
it is it works right

2730.4 --> 2733.839
through practical experience

2736.48 --> 2740.16
what does that have to do with faith

2737.92 --> 2741.76
that's just trusting what you learned

2740.16 --> 2744.7599999999998
that's trusting what you know to be

2741.76 --> 2744.76
correct

2747.359 --> 2750.64
dude are you going to keep repeating

2748.96 --> 2751.92
that [ __ ] over and over again you're

2750.64 --> 2754.0
getting on my nerves here is this

2751.92 --> 2756.48
getting annoying aries cursor man this

2754.0 --> 2759.72
is getting really annoying

2756.48 --> 2759.72
you're chanting

2764.4 --> 2769.839
faith is confidence

2766.8 --> 2771.8390000000004
no confidence is confidence

2769.839 --> 2775.599
but

2771.839 --> 2778.0789999999997
having faith in yourself is confidence

2775.599 --> 2780.48
it's complicated

2778.079 --> 2782.96
but yes one for the unit

2780.48 --> 2784.72
you're a lot closer to

2782.96 --> 2789.48
understanding what we're talking about

2784.72 --> 2789.48
here than aries curse of man it seems

2793.119 --> 2797.76
yeah aries curse of man foundation of

2795.04 --> 2800.4
kriya christianity is faith

2797.76 --> 2804.8
just like the foundation

2800.4 --> 2808.52
of president obama's campaign was hope

2804.8 --> 2808.52
yeah we know

2816.079 --> 2821.76
we also know through a certain quote

2820.24 --> 2826.24
that

2821.76 --> 2826.2400000000002
men will perish for a lack of knowledge

2829.76 --> 2834.4
right not a lack of faith lack of

2831.92 --> 2834.4
knowledge

2835.359 --> 2839.96
or do you disagree with that too

2854.319 --> 2860.8
you know what inspires confidence

2857.599 --> 2862.96
a lot if you know how to deal with

2860.8 --> 2865.2000000000003
learning things

2862.96 --> 2866.4
knowing it right because when you know

2865.2 --> 2868.0789999999997
it

2866.4 --> 2870.1600000000003
you can trust it

2868.079 --> 2872.88
and then when you trust things you have

2870.16 --> 2873.839
confidence about dealing with it

2872.88 --> 2876.079
right

2873.839 --> 2876.0789999999997
so

2878.4 --> 2883.0
what are we really talking about here

2920.319 --> 2924.88
yeah we do practically lovejoy welcome

2922.559 --> 2924.88
to the

2926.839 --> 2932.16
chat earth is flat and stationary

2932.24 --> 2937.24
and

2934.24 --> 2937.24
contain

2948.079 --> 2951.92
right

2949.28 --> 2954.1600000000003
the word contained should definitely be

2951.92 --> 2957.16
the the third

2954.16 --> 2957.16
element

2959.04 --> 2964.16
flat stationary contained it's critical

2962.4 --> 2968.2400000000002
right

2964.16 --> 2972.16
it's the the the trinity of the earth

2968.24 --> 2972.16
huh let's play around a little

2975.359 --> 2980.68
flat stationary

2977.68 --> 2980.68
contained

2995.44 --> 2998.839
time is flying

3001.599 --> 3006.0
you would love to go up to the moon

3006.4 --> 3010.96
really

3008.0 --> 3014.72
well how would you do that

3010.96 --> 3016.88
ever tried to catch a rainbow

3014.72 --> 3019.9199999999996
anybody ever found that pot of gold at

3016.88 --> 3019.92
the end of the rainbow

3023.04 --> 3027.52
but yeah

3024.839 --> 3031.2799999999997
antarctica it's still a very interesting

3027.52 --> 3035.2
region who knows what is in there

3031.28 --> 3035.2000000000003
right underneath perhaps

3035.76 --> 3042.6400000000003
because i think that

3038.64 --> 3042.64
antarctica really is like a

3043.44 --> 3047.28
a part of

3045.04 --> 3050.5589999999997
an ancient civilization that even like

3047.28 --> 3054.6400000000003
was probably connected to the same

3050.559 --> 3057.92
civilization that also erected like the

3054.64 --> 3058.96
the ancient buildings in america

3057.92 --> 3060.079
before

3058.96 --> 3063.28
europe

3060.079 --> 3065.6800000000003
europeans settled in

3063.28 --> 3067.92
and then claimed that they built it

3065.68 --> 3070.48
right i think that

3067.92 --> 3072.64
underneath antarctica is probably

3070.48 --> 3075.28
remnants of the same civilization and

3072.64 --> 3076.24
who knows what is underneath there

3075.28 --> 3077.6800000000003
right

3076.24 --> 3080.0789999999997
doesn't have even have to be like

3077.68 --> 3082.48
glacial caverns or anything it could

3080.079 --> 3085.3590000000004
literally be just a giant

3082.48 --> 3088.559
giant cave underneath there

3085.359 --> 3091.359
or a tunnel system leading to the other

3088.559 --> 3093.6800000000003
side of the ice or leading to

3091.359 --> 3096.96
even another

3093.68 --> 3100.3999999999996
realm layer underneath

3096.96 --> 3103.839
shale something who knows man who knows

3100.4 --> 3103.839
it could be so many things

3104.8 --> 3110.119
tartar yeah you could call it tartaria

3106.96 --> 3110.119
why not

3122.839 --> 3127.2799999999997
uh

3124.8 --> 3131.04
wow clutch bear

3127.28 --> 3131.0400000000004
that's very hard to tell really

3134.4 --> 3139.119
i think that we've been presented by an

3136.319 --> 3140.88
ironic false dichotomy

3139.119 --> 3144.48
where on one hand

3140.88 --> 3146.0
it is said yeah it's very very young

3144.48 --> 3149.839
very very young and we were like

3146.0 --> 3149.839
basically the first one to enter

3150.48 --> 3155.599
and

3151.68 --> 3156.48
the other false dichotomy says

3155.599 --> 3159.2000000000003
oh

3156.48 --> 3160.48
but we evolved from

3159.2 --> 3162.96
mammals

3160.48 --> 3165.359
and before that the dinosaurs and

3162.96 --> 3167.76
millions and millions of years ago right

3165.359 --> 3169.119
that's the other side right so it's like

3167.76 --> 3172.3190000000004
too short

3169.119 --> 3174.319
versus insanely out of proportion long

3172.319 --> 3176.16
and irrealistic

3174.319 --> 3178.4
unrealistic

3176.16 --> 3182.24
but i think that the idea that like

3178.4 --> 3182.2400000000002
earth is only 5 000 years old

3183.119 --> 3187.119
i think that's

3184.319 --> 3188.5589999999997
probably incorrect i think that just a

3187.119 --> 3191.28
lot but

3188.559 --> 3194.6400000000003
maybe human beings have been around for

3191.28 --> 3197.119
5 000 years for or something or this

3194.64 --> 3199.2799999999997
version of humans right

3197.119 --> 3201.52
maybe they were just

3199.28 --> 3205.52
humans were slightly different before

3201.52 --> 3209.16
that and all that history is just gone

3205.52 --> 3209.16
like it's all gone

3209.44 --> 3213.119
and maybe

3210.8 --> 3217.599
they were the ones to leave some of

3213.119 --> 3217.599
these miraculous ancient buildings even

3218.48 --> 3221.68
some of them

3219.839 --> 3224.88
that still for some reason stand the

3221.68 --> 3224.8799999999997
test of time who knows

3227.68 --> 3232.64
right it gets recycled yeah that's what

3230.079 --> 3232.6400000000003
i think too

3234.48 --> 3238.079
it's like

3235.599 --> 3239.839
well not to take it too literal but you

3238.079 --> 3243.3590000000004
could compare it

3239.839 --> 3246.88
from a certain perspective with a

3243.359 --> 3246.88
simulator sandbox

3247.04 --> 3252.48
but it isn't it's not literally that but

3249.04 --> 3254.64
it i wouldn't be surprised if like the

3252.48 --> 3256.8
design just had elements of that and

3254.64 --> 3260.16
this is also why i've been calling it

3256.8 --> 3263.28
for such a long time

3260.16 --> 3267.7599999999998
physical reality is assimilatory

3263.28 --> 3270.1600000000003
not a simulation it's not the sims game

3267.76 --> 3273.5200000000004
there's not a over reality and this is

3270.16 --> 3278.319
not real it is real but the way it works

3273.52 --> 3280.72
seems like as if it was a simulation

3278.319 --> 3283.119
but we have no proof that there is

3280.72 --> 3284.48
an over reality

3283.119 --> 3286.079
that

3284.48 --> 3288.2400000000002
that basically

3286.079 --> 3289.76
nullifies this

3288.24 --> 3292.4799999999996
simulation

3289.76 --> 3294.48
to potentially be assumed right

3292.48 --> 3297.04
and that's why i say yeah i think it

3294.48 --> 3299.44
might be like a primary testing ground

3297.04 --> 3301.7599999999998
and it should be taken very serious

3299.44 --> 3304.839
but it is almost like as

3301.76 --> 3308.6400000000003
as humans would on their computers

3304.839 --> 3310.88
simulate a virtual environment

3308.64 --> 3312.96
in many ways

3310.88 --> 3315.76
in many mechanics it just seems like

3312.96 --> 3318.0
that probably for the

3315.76 --> 3320.4
designer's convenience even like because

3318.0 --> 3322.48
if you were gonna literally fabricate

3320.4 --> 3326.96
the very patterns that would naturally

3322.48 --> 3330.88
unfold of reality in every factor

3326.96 --> 3332.96
wouldn't you try to construct that as

3330.88 --> 3335.44
a computer programmer would try to

3332.96 --> 3337.68
construct a realm just element by

3335.44 --> 3340.2400000000002
element programming it and then if they

3337.68 --> 3343.52
were smart designers they would

3340.24 --> 3346.3999999999996
lay out standard structural patterns

3343.52 --> 3348.64
that they could easily follow

3346.4 --> 3350.64
right they wouldn't just clunk in [ __ ]

3348.64 --> 3352.16
try to make it fit and then rearrange

3350.64 --> 3355.359
everything every single time no they

3352.16 --> 3357.44
would like pre-envision

3355.359 --> 3360.0
the structures of it and then build

3357.44 --> 3361.92
accordingly well

3360.0 --> 3363.599
that gives the impression that it is

3361.92 --> 3365.119
simulatory

3363.599 --> 3366.6400000000003
i i don't know if anybody can still

3365.119 --> 3368.319
follow what i'm talking about at this

3366.64 --> 3369.839
point

3368.319 --> 3371.839
but

3369.839 --> 3374.839
right that's that's what i think about

3371.839 --> 3374.839
it

3387.839 --> 3396.04
rainbows are toxic what

3390.48 --> 3396.04
it's only on flags dude only on flags

3415.2 --> 3421.04
regarding trouble as an aries scripture

3417.52 --> 3421.04
man you seem very scared

3421.44 --> 3426.48
what's next you're gonna tell me i have

3423.2 --> 3426.48
to believe in the trinity

3426.96 --> 3432.44
you're gonna go that way

3428.799 --> 3432.44
are you so scared

3433.04 --> 3439.04
why are you scared

3434.799 --> 3439.04
didn't jesus tell you to not be afraid

3439.68 --> 3444.3999999999996
a lot

3441.68 --> 3444.3999999999996
are you scared

3445.04 --> 3447.839
if you have a

3448.72 --> 3452.24
legitimate point

3450.4 --> 3455.2000000000003
that will actually stand the test of

3452.24 --> 3458.52
time and our combined ascension then why

3455.2 --> 3458.52
are you afraid

3465.76 --> 3468.8390000000004
all right

3477.44 --> 3482.0
oh requires yeah

3479.599 --> 3486.52
you know why air is the curse of man

3482.0 --> 3486.52
because it's all ridiculous

3494.24 --> 3497.2799999999997
yeah

3495.119 --> 3500.7200000000003
the trinity is ridiculous the virgin

3497.28 --> 3502.4
birth is just not necessary

3500.72 --> 3503.839
what you're you're going to suggest he's

3502.4 --> 3507.6800000000003
not human

3503.839 --> 3510.16
his need to make him into that

3507.68 --> 3511.52
physical avatar

3510.16 --> 3512.799
praying to himself and

3511.52 --> 3516.24
[Music]

3512.799 --> 3520.559
oh why have i

3516.24 --> 3520.5589999999997
forsaken me all that [ __ ] come on

3520.96 --> 3525.76
i mean the resurrection perhaps but hey

3523.28 --> 3528.0
i have an alternative idea to that maybe

3525.76 --> 3530.7200000000003
he didn't actually die maybe he just

3528.0 --> 3533.44
survived through a gruesome process

3530.72 --> 3535.1189999999997
which is in my opinion a legitimate

3533.44 --> 3538.4
miracle

3535.119 --> 3539.599
and a testament of personal spiritual

3538.4 --> 3540.96
power

3539.599 --> 3542.839
and

3540.96 --> 3546.2400000000002
knowledge application

3542.839 --> 3546.24
both right

3553.92 --> 3557.96
yeah

3554.96 --> 3557.96
so

3558.319 --> 3562.96
it requires faith well does it

3561.04 --> 3565.04
does it really need your faith do you

3562.96 --> 3567.359
really need to believe that

3565.04 --> 3567.359
why

3568.559 --> 3571.119
he died

3571.44 --> 3577.76
maybe he did clutch maybe he didn't

3575.2 --> 3579.9199999999996
there's definitely signs that he might

3577.76 --> 3581.6800000000003
have potentially possibly survived

3579.92 --> 3584.079
through it

3581.68 --> 3586.319
but yeah

3584.079 --> 3588.96
it's not like oh i would survive through

3586.319 --> 3591.04
that no no no it's just saying that it

3588.96 --> 3595.28
might technically be possible that he

3591.04 --> 3595.2799999999997
hadn't actually fully died

3597.68 --> 3603.44
but hey if he did and he was resurrected

3601.119 --> 3606.319
i'm okay with that

3603.44 --> 3608.7200000000003
i just don't think that the actual dying

3606.319 --> 3610.48
and resurrection is even

3608.72 --> 3613.4399999999996
that important

3610.48 --> 3616.48
in the face of just the

3613.44 --> 3618.319
the level of insight and purity that he

3616.48 --> 3620.2400000000002
brought

3618.319 --> 3623.64
with his words

3620.24 --> 3623.64
and his actions

3641.839 --> 3644.16
fine

3644.48 --> 3648.88
fine well

3646.88 --> 3650.6400000000003
who am i to judge you know i don't know

3648.88 --> 3653.28
whether they were

3650.64 --> 3656.5989999999997
even capable of understanding anything

3653.28 --> 3656.599
about it

3659.839 --> 3664.0
i i just know that

3661.839 --> 3666.24
if i had been there with the knowledge i

3664.0 --> 3668.48
do now i would have tested certain

3666.24 --> 3668.4799999999996
things

3668.839 --> 3674.64
right maybe he was in a state of

3672.559 --> 3676.7200000000003
hibernation

3674.64 --> 3680.5589999999997
just spitballing at this point but in

3676.72 --> 3680.5589999999997
that direction like he was just

3680.799 --> 3687.359
turned off but not dead but seemed dead

3685.119 --> 3687.359
right

3688.16 --> 3693.1189999999997
were they experts were they all medical

3690.88 --> 3695.599
experts that his family

3693.119 --> 3695.599
and all that

3697.44 --> 3702.88
i mean for most people if they just saw

3700.079 --> 3704.1600000000003
somebody that's all beaten up and bloody

3702.88 --> 3705.2000000000003
and [ __ ]

3704.16 --> 3707.04
and they

3705.2 --> 3709.359
like would notice like oh he doesn't

3707.04 --> 3711.2
seem to have a pulse might did he even

3709.359 --> 3714.88
check that right well they watched him

3711.2 --> 3717.1189999999997
but did they specifically check a pulse

3714.88 --> 3719.28
and then if i would see like oh he's not

3717.119 --> 3720.799
breathing then i would kind of very

3719.28 --> 3722.88
quickly assume

3720.799 --> 3725.2
he must be dead right

3722.88 --> 3727.839
but how do you absolutely know with

3725.2 --> 3727.839
certainty

3728.88 --> 3734.4
well maybe they just didn't check

3730.4 --> 3736.64
because just the idea that he was dead

3734.4 --> 3739.599
just shocked them so much that they

3736.64 --> 3740.5589999999997
didn't even think to really

3739.599 --> 3742.559
inquire

3740.559 --> 3744.1600000000003
further

3742.559 --> 3746.6400000000003
i don't know

3744.16 --> 3748.5589999999997
i don't know with certainty

3746.64 --> 3750.4
i just know

3748.559 --> 3751.6800000000003
that i don't think it's really that

3750.4 --> 3753.039
important

3751.68 --> 3755.52
in the face

3753.039 --> 3758.76
of what he actually taught

3755.52 --> 3758.7599999999998
two people

3765.43 --> 3769.839
[Music]

3768.079 --> 3772.319
all right because all the other stuff

3769.839 --> 3775.359
this faith and all these things and him

3772.319 --> 3777.839
making him the literal god

3775.359 --> 3780.839
physical god in the world

3777.839 --> 3784.64
like how is that helping you how is

3780.839 --> 3786.88
that helping you ascend how does that

3784.64 --> 3789.2
teach you to do the right thing no it

3786.88 --> 3791.599
doesn't it just distracts you and makes

3789.2 --> 3794.96
you overconfident like i'm on the right

3791.599 --> 3796.6400000000003
side i got a god on my side

3794.96 --> 3797.76
that means i don't have to take [ __ ]

3796.64 --> 3800.16
anymore

3797.76 --> 3802.2400000000002
yeah that in reality that's how a lot of

3800.16 --> 3804.319
people respond to that

3802.24 --> 3805.5989999999997
right

3804.319 --> 3809.359
it's

3805.599 --> 3811.839
they turned him into a little g

3809.359 --> 3813.5989999999997
and then people worship him as a little

3811.839 --> 3816.0
g

3813.599 --> 3818.88
even though he literally

3816.0 --> 3820.079
did his utmost best

3818.88 --> 3822.88
to teach

3820.079 --> 3825.8390000000004
everybody in his core teachings to not

3822.88 --> 3825.839
do that

3836.559 --> 3840.7200000000003
okay clutch hey gem

3848.079 --> 3853.8390000000004
pre-incarnation of vegetarianism cool

3851.599 --> 3853.839
why not

3871.2 --> 3876.24
oh yeah yeah i know er you think i

3873.839 --> 3878.839
didn't know that i haven't heard all

3876.24 --> 3882.0
those things everything

3878.839 --> 3884.48
yeah dude there's movies about that

3882.0 --> 3886.559
specific about all the freaking torture

3884.48 --> 3888.96
now yeah we know

3886.559 --> 3891.76
we know the iconography you got stuck in

3888.96 --> 3891.76
your head we know

3899.599 --> 3904.799
and i know that the roman centurion was

3902.16 --> 3907.96
definitely confident that he was dead

3904.799 --> 3907.96
but they

3909.92 --> 3914.079
yeah

3911.76 --> 3916.7990000000004
they didn't break his legs though

3914.079 --> 3918.2400000000002
so he wasn't literally in all his wounds

3916.799 --> 3919.68
hanging

3918.24 --> 3922.799
on the nails

3919.68 --> 3925.2
he actually had kind of room to

3922.799 --> 3925.2
stand

3925.44 --> 3929.28
so maybe he just

3927.359 --> 3931.44
actually did survive that

3929.28 --> 3933.119
despite that right

3931.44 --> 3934.839
i mean

3933.119 --> 3938.1600000000003
people can

3934.839 --> 3940.72
survive devastating wounds

3938.16 --> 3942.8799999999997
seemingly miraculously because it just

3940.72 --> 3945.4399999999996
despite how it looks despite all the

3942.88 --> 3947.6800000000003
physical the shock response and all that

3945.44 --> 3949.599
and even blood

3947.68 --> 3951.1189999999997
it might just

3949.599 --> 3954.0
not have killed him

3951.119 --> 3956.7200000000003
despite it being very convincing

3954.0 --> 3956.72
you don't know

3956.88 --> 3963.6800000000003
people like have gotten like

3960.319 --> 3966.48
giant spikes through their skull

3963.68 --> 3968.96
and literally survived with like having

3966.48 --> 3970.079
visible holes right through them

3968.96 --> 3972.48
right

3970.079 --> 3975.3590000000004
like yeah normally you die yeah yeah we

3972.48 --> 3978.319
know that happens normally

3975.359 --> 3980.24
sometimes it doesn't go

3978.319 --> 3983.24
and then everybody gets kind of freaked

3980.24 --> 3983.24
out

3993.599 --> 3999.119
yeah dude i do i don't want to talk

3995.839 --> 4002.72
about that [ __ ] i i don't

3999.119 --> 4005.44
i don't care i don't care

4002.72 --> 4006.5589999999997
i don't care that you believe he had to

4005.44 --> 4008.7200000000003
die

4006.559 --> 4010.799
because it allows you to get away with

4008.72 --> 4012.319
whatever you want in this life squirt

4010.799 --> 4015.839
all you like and then you go to heaven

4012.319 --> 4020.319
because he died he died he had to die

4015.839 --> 4022.72
put some more torture representations up

4020.319 --> 4026.48
as an excuse to do whatever the [ __ ] you

4022.72 --> 4029.0389999999998
want because he died yeah that's not my

4026.48 --> 4029.039
religion

4030.48 --> 4035.839
that is not my religion

4034.079 --> 4037.3590000000004
i don't care if you think that doesn't

4035.839 --> 4038.96
make me a christian

4037.359 --> 4040.48
because i take

4038.96 --> 4043.119
his words

4040.48 --> 4045.359
and his actions very serious

4043.119 --> 4047.599
and i apply them

4045.359 --> 4050.0
to what most people would consider

4047.599 --> 4052.079
insane levels

4050.0 --> 4055.039
not that i'm perfect

4052.079 --> 4057.599
but in my consciousness

4055.039 --> 4060.0
i make no

4057.599 --> 4063.76
mistake i do not

4060.0 --> 4066.72
try to even justify sins like i

4063.76 --> 4070.48
recognize what it is

4066.72 --> 4070.48
right i'm very serious about

4074.839 --> 4078.0789999999997
that so

4079.28 --> 4085.92
yeah it blocked the spiritual current

4081.68 --> 4088.72
that's just disgusting that's satanic

4085.92 --> 4092.48
literally arie manic

4088.72 --> 4095.52
blood blood spilling death

4092.48 --> 4097.04
to accomplish something

4095.52 --> 4100.319
there's a certain

4097.04 --> 4102.08
very specific spirit frequency

4100.319 --> 4103.4400000000005
that dwells

4102.08 --> 4105.04
in this realm

4103.44 --> 4106.08
among men

4105.04 --> 4109.359
that

4106.08 --> 4112.96
absolutely agrees with that

4109.359 --> 4112.96
and it's called death

4114.56 --> 4120.080000000001
it's called iriman it's called satan

4118.08 --> 4122.88
he agrees with that

4120.08 --> 4126.48
blood the spiritual currency shedding of

4122.88 --> 4130.04
blood killing to accomplish something

4126.48 --> 4130.04
satan agrees

4138.56 --> 4142.719
lucifer is the bearer of lard

4143.04 --> 4149.48
like the fat of the land kind of lard

4146.159 --> 4149.48
that's interesting

4175.04 --> 4177.2789999999995
right

4179.839 --> 4186.44
that's right aries cursor man

4182.239 --> 4186.44
he knew it was gonna happen

4188.799 --> 4192.88
but since he knew was gonna happen

4193.12 --> 4197.04
if he knew

4194.8 --> 4199.4400000000005
he would be able to survive through it

4197.04 --> 4202.32
and make everybody believe he died you

4199.44 --> 4204.799999999999
think he'd say that or would he

4202.32 --> 4207.12
definitely lay it out like yeah i am

4204.8 --> 4209.360000000001
gonna die

4207.12 --> 4212.239
because if he hadn't he said

4209.36 --> 4212.96
yeah you know i will

4212.239 --> 4217.839999999999
be

4212.96 --> 4220.4
assumed to be completely dead and then

4217.84 --> 4222.88
later i will live through it you guess

4220.4 --> 4225.92
what's gonna happen then the people that

4222.88 --> 4228.08
actually want him dead or the spirit

4225.92 --> 4230.56
through others that want him dead

4228.08 --> 4232.4
they will get wind of it and they will

4230.56 --> 4234.4800000000005
finish him off they would have probably

4232.4 --> 4235.599999999999
cut his freaking head off

4234.48 --> 4238.159
okay

4235.6 --> 4240.2390000000005
if they knew that he might potentially

4238.159 --> 4244.28
somehow survive through it

4240.239 --> 4244.28
you think he would say that

4263.679 --> 4267.52
you don't even think about these things

4265.36 --> 4270.96
you're just trying to reinforce the

4267.52 --> 4273.360000000001
faith that you have been cursed with

4270.96 --> 4275.04
to believe that you must believe or

4273.36 --> 4277.12
you're in big trouble and you're no

4275.04 --> 4279.44
longer part of the group

4277.12 --> 4282.32
right seems like you're just trying to

4279.44 --> 4285.678999999999
find reinforcement for that faith

4282.32 --> 4288.639999999999
instead of joining me on this journey of

4285.679 --> 4291.92
figuring it out and understanding what

4288.64 --> 4294.0
could be what could have been

4291.92 --> 4297.36
what might have been

4294.0 --> 4299.199
as an honest analysis you don't seem to

4297.36 --> 4301.44
really want to be

4299.199 --> 4303.199
joining me in this aries the cursor man

4301.44 --> 4304.639999999999
you're just chanting it's getting on my

4303.199 --> 4307.12
nerves again

4304.64 --> 4307.12
stop it

4308.719 --> 4315.679
but you respond to something i lay down

4311.44 --> 4319.28
why don't you respond rebut

4315.679 --> 4321.679
not move on to another chant

4319.28 --> 4325.04
like a baller does

4321.679 --> 4328.64
but instead address

4325.04 --> 4332.12
what i have said

4328.64 --> 4332.12
how about that

4346.08 --> 4350.32
that's not a rebuttal

4347.92 --> 4352.8
that's literally throwing a book at the

4350.32 --> 4352.799999999999
argument

4353.36 --> 4359.599999999999
your argument doesn't contain

4356.719 --> 4362.32
specific information that is relevant to

4359.6 --> 4362.320000000001
what i said

4363.36 --> 4365.92
yeah

4364.48 --> 4369.5199999999995
what i said

4365.92 --> 4372.88
is my own investigation of this book

4369.52 --> 4372.88
you are throwing at me

4373.199 --> 4378.719
yeah where do you think i get these

4375.84 --> 4378.719
ideas from

4379.36 --> 4384.48
it's based on what i read in the bible

4381.84 --> 4387.12
and what other people have been saying

4384.48 --> 4389.759999999999
about it yeah

4387.12 --> 4392.32
the bible is my rebuttal is not a

4389.76 --> 4392.320000000001
rebuttal

4393.84 --> 4398.4800000000005
that's like rumpus saying the body of

4396.159 --> 4400.4
science proves i'm right

4398.48 --> 4401.678999999999
you know how stupid that sounded when

4400.4 --> 4403.12
you did that

4401.679 --> 4404.8
remember that

4403.12 --> 4407.12
maybe it's too long ago for you i

4404.8 --> 4411.400000000001
definitely remember or what you just did

4407.12 --> 4411.4
it sounds exactly like that

4416.53 --> 4419.62
[Music]

4424.65 --> 4427.679999999999
[Music]

4438.56 --> 4444.400000000001
what the hell nature well is what does

4441.36 --> 4447.4
that have to do with anything

4444.4 --> 4447.4
hi

4466.8 --> 4470.8
all right yeah by the way that one for

4469.28 --> 4472.719
the unit

4470.8 --> 4476.719
that quotes a good quote

4472.719 --> 4476.719
be of good cheer i've overcome the world

4481.12 --> 4484.64
you could

4482.48 --> 4487.12
it it would literally be paraphrasing

4484.64 --> 4488.719
but in a way i'd like to read in that

4487.12 --> 4490.88
i'd like to i'm not

4488.719 --> 4493.36
going to claim it is legit or anything

4490.88 --> 4495.6
but it might be in other versions

4493.36 --> 4497.199
described like that instead of i have

4495.6 --> 4501.76
overcome the world

4497.199 --> 4501.759999999999
but i have not succumbed to the world

4505.04 --> 4509.679
or how about my spirit has endured the

4508.08 --> 4510.64
world

4509.679 --> 4513.36
right

4510.64 --> 4516.52
all those things would mean the same in

4513.36 --> 4516.5199999999995
my opinion

4539.199 --> 4543.04
all right by the way does anybody have

4541.04 --> 4544.48
an idea why yesterday's show has so

4543.04 --> 4547.36
little views

4544.48 --> 4549.12
that was like weird never had that low

4547.36 --> 4551.679
amount of views

4549.12 --> 4554.48
a long time that was just odd

4551.679 --> 4556.8
it was a kind of short show too but

4554.48 --> 4556.799999999999
still

4556.96 --> 4560.56
i don't know

4558.56 --> 4563.56
maybe everybody's just really busy this

4560.56 --> 4563.56
weekend

4572.08 --> 4575.08
so

4586.88 --> 4590.2390000000005
