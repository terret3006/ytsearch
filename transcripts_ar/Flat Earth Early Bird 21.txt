0.86 --> 8.099
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

5.43 --> 10.23
early-bird number 21 the three-week

8.099 --> 13.95
anniversary I'm your host

10.23 --> 18.6
Arwen today starting out I have no

13.95 --> 20.85
guests again usual not expecting anyone

18.6 --> 24.18
specific but anyone is welcome to join

20.85 --> 26.340000000000003
you know what to do in the description

24.18 --> 30.929
below you can see my skype address add

26.34 --> 34.8
me and yeah that way we can talk over

30.929 --> 37.41
Skype I think your you would be rude

34.8 --> 39.149
guests for the show I'll add you I'll

37.41 --> 44.3
give you a hang up Nick

39.149 --> 49.17
so yeah yesterday's hangout was bit of a

44.3 --> 55.23
unexpected blast the Hori is quite the

49.17 --> 56.760000000000005
showman and even though his approach is

55.23 --> 59.968999999999994
I guess you could say very

56.76 --> 63.78
commercialized and he's good at it it's

59.969 --> 66.15
not really to my taste on average but

63.78 --> 69.74
yeah he's so good at it you can't help

66.15 --> 75.77000000000001
but have some respect for that and he is

69.74 --> 79.32
just deep down a really good person so

75.77 --> 81.96
yeah it was good to have him on and to

79.32 --> 86.39999999999999
talk about a little thing that triggered

81.96 --> 87.36
it his use of the flat earth or the

86.4 --> 90.92
early birds

87.36 --> 95.64
you made an icon for it just like an AK

90.92 --> 99.72
you know I'm all for spreading good

95.64 --> 104.64
ideas but yeah I do have an ego and well

99.72 --> 108.06
anyway we talked about it and yeah he's

104.64 --> 111.63
just doing what he does has no hostile

108.06 --> 115.409
intentions or anything so he'll it'll be

111.63 --> 118.52
what it'll be and I'm fine with it so as

115.409 --> 121.259
long as this show just keeps running

118.52 --> 125.149
it's what it is what it is it's a very

121.259 --> 125.149
different type of show was how he does

125.36 --> 130.929
are we being much more organized and

128.16 --> 134.379
much more topic specific and

130.929 --> 137.56
yeah more commercial obviously makes

134.379 --> 140.379
vert Iseman calls and all kinds of

137.56 --> 143.739
things he does it's a very busy guy very

140.379 --> 149.01
professional in that sense and here we

143.739 --> 153.489
just talk I just talked to your eyes and

149.01 --> 157.23899999999998
try to educate in my own way and if

153.489 --> 160.299
people help to give people the tools

157.239 --> 164.25
they need to actually see through how

160.299 --> 168.48000000000002
things work in the world both on

164.25 --> 171.159
cosmogonic a level as on social level

168.48 --> 174.879
societal level that's well that's what I

171.159 --> 176.909
try to do on this show anyway and it's a

174.879 --> 180.989
it's a different approach a different

176.909 --> 183.42999999999998
atmosphere different target audience I

180.989 --> 186.09900000000002
guess a little bit more niche

183.43 --> 188.37900000000002
what's yeah everyone has their own

186.099 --> 190.17999999999998
target audience this is what I'm good at

188.379 --> 192.54899999999998
this is what I like to do is where I

190.18 --> 197.37900000000002
feel at home and I look forward every

192.549 --> 199.12
day to the show now so never yeah with

197.379 --> 201.76
flatter talks there was a lot of nerves

199.12 --> 205.81
but that was also because I was really

201.76 --> 208.78
putting out concepts yeah that I know

205.81 --> 211.599
were extremely important but usually

208.78 --> 213.97
when I started up about it I still was

211.599 --> 215.59
working through it and I was just scared

213.97 --> 217.239
that I would get something wrong and

215.59 --> 219.849
that would look really stupid later on

217.239 --> 220.949
and that did happen here and there are

219.849 --> 223.89999999999998
few incidents

220.949 --> 226.239
it's a dental misinterpretations blah

223.9 --> 229.989
blah it's a gradual learning process it

226.239 --> 233.109
has been for me but yeah i acted most

229.989 --> 234.84900000000002
things and redone things here and there

233.109 --> 235.419
and they're still gonna be more flatter

234.849 --> 239.88899999999998
talks

235.419 --> 241.54000000000002
although yeah nervous about that now but

239.889 --> 246.09900000000002
there are so many things that have come

241.54 --> 249.489
up even from the historical perspectives

246.099 --> 255.33999999999997
that i could basically add an addendum

249.489 --> 259.12
about the the post floods the ancient

255.34 --> 262.12
era the classical era as i call it and

259.12 --> 263.83
the age of illusions the industrial era

262.12 --> 267.009
there's so much

263.83 --> 269.229
new data new developments more

267.009 --> 271.81
refinement of what seems to have

269.229 --> 274.78
happened there that I could also let out

271.81 --> 280.539
better even try to make some kind of

274.78 --> 284.25899999999996
flowchart for the events would be worth

280.539 --> 287.68
digging into but it needs a with me the

284.259 --> 289.569
heaviest subjects especially Novi the

287.68 --> 292.78000000000003
bigger insights take some time to

289.569 --> 294.72900000000004
sinking unless everything just flash

292.78 --> 296.19899999999996
flash comes on to me and I'm just so

294.729 --> 299.349
inspired just have to put it out

296.199 --> 303.159
immediately doesn't always happen and it

299.349 --> 306.25
happens rarely actually but there will

303.159 --> 309.639
be more Flat Earth talks and I just need

306.25 --> 313.09
to get organized and get busy and stop

309.639 --> 317.71000000000004
relying on just my improvisation skills

313.09 --> 320.349
and that you have what I also do I look

317.71 --> 324.539
back these flattered talks a lot but did

320.349 --> 327.31
these Flat Earth early birds because

324.539 --> 328.99
because I improvise in my thinking and

327.31 --> 331.63
my thoughts sometimes I put things out

328.99 --> 335.68
there that are pretty damn detailed but

331.63 --> 338.77
that I will actually just forget really

335.68 --> 340.569
quickly after because there is so much

338.77 --> 345.06899999999996
on my mind it's good to then hear it

340.569 --> 349.3
back and like resize it up like what is

345.069 --> 351.13
this that I dug up in that in that

349.3 --> 355.12
thinking process is that really

351.13 --> 358.09
something good so yeah it's like the

355.12 --> 360.52
life thing is rough mining for me and

358.09 --> 363.92999999999995
then afterwards I can just pick out the

360.52 --> 366.099
gems as where that seems to work

363.93 --> 368.919
probably other people doing it as well

366.099 --> 375.4
but well oh well freedom of information

368.919 --> 377.81899999999996
it's a learning process for everyone but

375.4 --> 384.4
yeah there is a lot of developments a

377.819 --> 386.949
lot of new ideas you know over

384.4 --> 391.08
generalize so much that I basically lost

386.949 --> 396.789
track but the specifics of this was

391.08 --> 397.57
anyway the a call to the world to anyone

396.789 --> 400.5
listening out

397.57 --> 405.65999999999997
style still stands open if there's

400.5 --> 410.65
people that have really well studied in

405.66 --> 412.90000000000003
religion specific types and also in a

410.65 --> 418.29999999999995
historical context that have really dug

412.9 --> 420.31
into the details not necessarily very

418.3 --> 423.7
religious themselves but just well

420.31 --> 425.88
studied device might be some friction

423.7 --> 428.46999999999997
here and there don't want to do that

425.88 --> 430.96
please do come on the show because there

428.47 --> 432.91
is so many ideas that I want to reflect

430.96 --> 439.71999999999997
upon the finer details because knowledge

432.91 --> 442.24
with it's so big and it's like too big

439.72 --> 447.73
for me to just start out I need some

442.24 --> 451.09000000000003
structural oversight first before I can

447.73 --> 453.46000000000004
pick out parts that are just yet before

451.09 --> 457.09
I can recognize parts in the vast

453.46 --> 460.53999999999996
library of knowledge that are really

457.09 --> 463.27
worthy to actually look into and study

460.54 --> 467.62
and from there I'm develop my wider

463.27 --> 471.25
knowledge the religions their insights

467.62 --> 473.59000000000003
and their wisdoms and their roots where

471.25 --> 478.72
is it coming from the structure patterns

473.59 --> 481.97999999999996
yeah so anyone that's better that the

478.72 --> 486.28000000000003
Hindu religion or even the Nordic

481.98 --> 489.81
religion the myths and what else is out

486.28 --> 492.78999999999996
there yeah some Islamic background

489.81 --> 495.91
knowledge is also very interesting

492.79 --> 498.88
especially concerning the the Sufi

495.91 --> 501.25
branch of Islam that nobody ever talks

498.88 --> 506.59
about it is so much extinct you know

501.25 --> 509.62
which is a 1/3 the third branch compared

506.59 --> 512.28
to the Sunnis and the Shiites and it is

509.62 --> 516.36
a much more philosophical almost

512.28 --> 519.88
Buddhist like very liberal very free

516.36 --> 522.19
type of Islam and yet the other groups

519.88 --> 524.02
the other two groups actually don't like

522.19 --> 527.2
them and they have persecuted them all

524.02 --> 528.79
since the beginning so but they're out

527.2 --> 530.37
there and they're very interesting I

528.79 --> 531.75
have one friend over the

530.37 --> 533.79
never known for a very long time that

531.75 --> 535.98
has looked into it and she knows a lot

533.79 --> 541.74
about it and we talks there are some

535.98 --> 546.45
really good things in there and it's it

541.74 --> 554.58
has a very the people that are in there

546.45 --> 557.99
are not wiser they understand the the

554.58 --> 561.48
extremities of yeah yeah how you say

557.99 --> 564.86
fundamentalism and that and they reject

561.48 --> 567.9
that and they have a very well argued

564.86 --> 569.67
approach this is very interesting yet

567.9 --> 574.56
nobody knows about this but yeah if

569.67 --> 576.8389999999999
you're interested in Islam or think that

574.56 --> 580.7399999999999
it's all just to the same you should

576.839 --> 583.19
look into the Sufi branch of it because

580.74 --> 586.98
it is really interesting and different

583.19 --> 589.5290000000001
just do it if you have the opportunity

586.98 --> 592.86
maybe you can find a finding in library

589.529 --> 596.12
or something but yeah that's also out

592.86 --> 598.74
there add religious discussions always

596.12 --> 601.589
interesting they have so many questions

598.74 --> 605.19
and all religions I want to compare that

601.589 --> 607.589
the system structures and also the

605.19 --> 611.1
psychological I analyzed the

607.589 --> 613.3800000000001
psychological angle of the people in the

611.1 --> 616.1700000000001
religion like how does it work and how

613.38 --> 619.5889999999999
does it steer everything to work

616.17 --> 623.01
what is inevitably to come from it that

619.589 --> 625.589
kind of thing philosophers so yeah I

623.01 --> 628.26
love to do that anyone out there that

625.589 --> 631.2600000000001
happens to stumble upon this show and

628.26 --> 633.54
it's not like startled I yeah the hell

631.26 --> 636.3
out because of the flat earth in the

633.54 --> 638.13
title don't worry we don't need to talk

636.3 --> 642.3299999999999
about that it is something that I do

638.13 --> 645.209
talk about pretty much yeah widely but

642.33 --> 647.82
I'm not like so obsessed over it that

645.209 --> 649.89
somebody doesn't like it or doesn't want

647.82 --> 652.6500000000001
to talk about it that I will force it

649.89 --> 655.3199999999999
upon them so don't worry about that just

652.65 --> 658.65
religion talk absolutely fine I'm not

655.32 --> 661.98
gonna necessarily ask even cosmogony

658.65 --> 665.649
related questions about two religions

661.98 --> 667.72
I'm more interested in the in the

665.649 --> 670.569
characters mostly in it and where do

667.72 --> 674.2900000000001
they come from what are they like

670.569 --> 676.209
and compare it to other religions for

674.29 --> 680.379
example that's kind of thing that I'm

676.209 --> 682.949
really interested in doing so yeah a lot

680.379 --> 682.9490000000001
of meta talk

689.399 --> 693.36
what about next

714.91 --> 723.3399999999999
again I do a lot of things look surreal

719.56 --> 725.31
things and like presupposition and not

723.34 --> 727.51
because watching it based but

725.31 --> 729.9699999999999
presuppositional things like things that

727.51 --> 733.2
I remember from my patients like what it

729.97 --> 736.1700000000001
is was true what if that was true and

733.2 --> 743.8900000000001
sometimes I get caught up in a lot of

736.17 --> 749.9499999999999
pretty supposition Oh mind bickering

743.89 --> 752.11
into my own how do you say contemplating

749.95 --> 764.9200000000001
let me finish find the right word if

752.11 --> 770.26
there's a specific touch huh okay it's

764.92 --> 774.76
called mull fancy yeah to worry say

770.26 --> 777.28
there yeah right Wow okay there's a lot

774.76 --> 779.83
of words for it but anyway I just think

777.28 --> 782.5
about basically presuppositional well is

779.83 --> 785.26
like what if this is true what is gonna

782.5 --> 788.89
happen and what if it's not true how

785.26 --> 792.64
will I notice this integration of this

788.89 --> 796.68
possibility that I of it like okay it's

792.64 --> 801.0699999999999
not making starting to make a mark as I

796.68 --> 803.9499999999999
expect it so it must be illusion based

801.07 --> 806.6500000000001
and then are there any other signs in

803.95 --> 810.1500000000001
the indications that I have and yes I

806.65 --> 810.15
talked about earlier I can actually

810.84 --> 816.61
figure out better and more detailed of

813.97 --> 820.08
my just through my memory as to what

816.61 --> 820.08
I've been going through and

823.379 --> 827.999
how do you say it's almost like taking a

826.019 --> 830.939
step back and just letting the

827.999 --> 834.5690000000001
experience be the experience but detach

830.939 --> 836.639
my own personal feelings of what I went

834.569 --> 838.139
through from it and just look at it from

836.639 --> 840.479
a distance like what is actually

838.139 --> 842.339
happening what are the process says that

840.479 --> 845.249
I'm going through and what is actually

842.339 --> 848.249
it is really complex to do because the

845.249 --> 850.9490000000001
experience by default was so close to me

848.249 --> 855.259
I couldn't shut off my feelings it's one

850.949 --> 858.779
of the very annoying side effects so I

855.259 --> 860.4590000000001
had to constantly temper my feelings

858.779 --> 864.329
while I was going through it not to go

860.459 --> 866.7589999999999
insane and was yeah there will come

864.329 --> 870.2389999999999
simply poking me and like trying to

866.759 --> 874.409
trigger that so because now the pleasant

870.239 --> 876.599
thing and hey good morning yeah some

874.409 --> 879.829
people may have like these types of

876.599 --> 882.5390000000001
experience in nightmares or anything

879.829 --> 885.539
makes you feel very powerless and I did

882.539 --> 888.059
that I did feel powerless a lot

885.539 --> 891.809
throughout even though intellectually

888.059 --> 895.7389999999999
during some parts I did get a grip and I

891.809 --> 897.7199999999999
did realize intellectually that things

895.739 --> 899.789
were going very well

897.72 --> 903.8090000000001
better than I originally expected in

899.789 --> 907.529
certain areas what was going to happen

903.809 --> 909.269
in the world but at the same time it's

907.529 --> 911.669
like being depressed it's just that

909.269 --> 915.029
feeling of like oh you're going to [ __ ]

911.669 --> 917.399
it didn't go away despite the

915.029 --> 921.239
intellectual realizations it was very

917.399 --> 924.359
annoying you could basically say okay I

921.239 --> 928.799
was clinically depressed all throughout

924.359 --> 930.8090000000001
the entire experience and if you

928.799 --> 932.85
consider that then I did very well

930.809 --> 937.169
coming through such a long experience

932.85 --> 945.109
and managing myself because it was

937.169 --> 951.149
extremely fast anyway yeah it's tough

945.109 --> 954.13
don't recommend be careful with harness

951.149 --> 956.38
energetics and especially

954.13 --> 959.05
if you're considering it our risk in

956.38 --> 962.43
with the people that you're doing it

959.05 --> 966.37
with trust them can you really trust

962.43 --> 970.12
like it's gotta be so careful with this

966.37 --> 972.52
kind of thing I just recommend not to do

970.12 --> 975.22
it at all you know like smoking cannabis

972.52 --> 977.77
is one thing but like the real serious

975.22 --> 981.25
stuff that is just poof

977.77 --> 984.01
I don't even try mushrooms I know some

981.25 --> 987.07
people that do that I just bump into and

984.01 --> 990.49
talk with them but yeah it's apparently

987.07 --> 992.83
really amazing but know you the

990.49 --> 995.65
experiences that they describe are very

992.83 --> 998.73
very mild compared to the experience

995.65 --> 1002.22
that I went through how that was it is a

998.73 --> 1005.46
full-blown timeless hallucination

1002.22 --> 1010.08
resident it's incredible and terrifying

1005.46 --> 1015.0600000000001
and too much like pretty full it is all

1010.08 --> 1017.61
too much like and there's no moment

1015.06 --> 1019.9499999999999
where it's actually going down from

1017.61 --> 1022.17
being too much it's always going to be

1019.95 --> 1027.02
too much that's the crazy thing of the

1022.17 --> 1027.02
experiences just oh no one there

1028.579 --> 1037.55
everything took so long for me anyway

1033.14 --> 1039.959
patient talk let's see who is in chat

1037.55 --> 1042.18
God is which Bella hello

1039.959 --> 1047.13
signs proof it's flat flat earther

1042.18 --> 1052.41
welcome Nicolas Roeg Thorson was good to

1047.13 --> 1057.75
see you dank David Reed hello Ellen be

1052.41 --> 1068.49
we yet have you don't be it's nice in

1057.75 --> 1074.84
this show all right Sabrina browning hey

1068.49 --> 1078.44
another David Reed huh another color you

1074.84 --> 1078.4399999999998
flat ball ooh

1080.36 --> 1087.02
a McKinsey flat astok good to see you

1084.35 --> 1089.03
guys welcome to the show yeah I've been

1087.02 --> 1092.929
talking for 50 minutes feels like an

1089.03 --> 1097.299
hour because just was bit tense enough

1092.929 --> 1099.38
to just always need to be careful it is

1097.299 --> 1101.48
even if I talked about it

1099.38 --> 1104.3300000000002
yeah I have this distance now but still

1101.48 --> 1108.44
it it was so extreme that every time

1104.33 --> 1112.76
it's got to be careful not to dive too

1108.44 --> 1115.46
deep or I'll be touched by the feelings

1112.76 --> 1122.59
of them and might rub off don't want

1115.46 --> 1122.5900000000001
that but yeah something isn't it

1134.95 --> 1144.309
and I've been studying more and more

1139.95 --> 1147.19
geopolitics a lot more and I've also

1144.309 --> 1149.889
noticed that before when you start out

1147.19 --> 1153.8200000000002
you start out like I can izing certain

1149.889 --> 1158.32
elements to get a rough picture and as

1153.82 --> 1161.95
time has settled now I see that it's not

1158.32 --> 1164.139
really as unified as it all seems kind

1161.95 --> 1165.73
of the government effect I guess but

1164.139 --> 1168.7199999999998
there are so many other little countries

1165.73 --> 1171.22
that have their own specific type of

1168.72 --> 1174.7
relations with each other country it's

1171.22 --> 1178.029
like it's really complex how it all

1174.7 --> 1182.5800000000002
works but also fascinating to learn the

1178.029 --> 1185.98
methodologies of each country and theirs

1182.58 --> 1189.039
we are more than plenty brutal elements

1185.98 --> 1191.489
either secret or in the open in in a lot

1189.039 --> 1196.09
of countries most countries I would say

1191.489 --> 1199.45
but still yeah if you can step away from

1196.09 --> 1202.059
that moral aspect of it with yeah it it

1199.45 --> 1205.299
is there and you can't act like it's not

1202.059 --> 1207.34
there but if you look away and approach

1205.299 --> 1210.6689999999999
it from a pragmatic perspective then

1207.34 --> 1215.559
suddenly it all makes more sense

1210.669 --> 1219.009
and you could almost see how it is

1215.559 --> 1221.98
workable to a certain degree although

1219.009 --> 1225.759
that burden of yeah that there is [ __ ]

1221.98 --> 1227.769
going on will always be there hiding in

1225.759 --> 1231.46
the background of it but it's

1227.769 --> 1236.97
fascinating and then I want to learn

1231.46 --> 1240.779
more like I want to learn more about

1236.97 --> 1240.779
diplomacy and how that works

1240.929 --> 1247.029
everything seems always straightforward

1243.129 --> 1253.119
but there are so many subtleties and

1247.029 --> 1257.109
detailed knowledge that real long

1253.119 --> 1259.359
lasting diplomats use like they they

1257.109 --> 1262.059
will learn a culture another culture

1259.359 --> 1264.46
that they're focused on so well that it

1262.059 --> 1266.049
will find these my new details that even

1264.46 --> 1268.27
the general public in that culture

1266.049 --> 1271.37
doesn't know but the

1268.27 --> 1273.77
people that are high standing will know

1271.37 --> 1275.3899999999999
and highly respect if somebody else

1273.77 --> 1277.8799999999999
especially an outsider will have that

1275.39 --> 1280.13
knowledge that type of thing it's

1277.88 --> 1286.22
fascinating it's so fascinating for me

1280.13 --> 1290.659
how it works and what you can do with

1286.22 --> 1294.8600000000001
that still of course all diplomats are

1290.659 --> 1299.2
always found by just the general plan of

1294.86 --> 1301.58
each country what their directive is

1299.2 --> 1309.289
they can have their own opinion about it

1301.58 --> 1311.1789999999999
and all that stuff and but yeah they

1309.289 --> 1313.1299999999999
must always be looking through the

1311.179 --> 1316.8500000000001
different options and directions things

1313.13 --> 1318.74
could be taking in and then putting

1316.85 --> 1321.5
their recommendation like yeah we got to

1318.74 --> 1323.39
do this because even in this situation

1321.5 --> 1326.33
or in that situation whatever might turn

1323.39 --> 1331.01
out this would always be better here and

1326.33 --> 1333.71
therefore and yeah that will contribute

1331.01 --> 1340.97
to decision-making in policies and

1333.71 --> 1344.26
that's it's awesome if you're if you are

1340.97 --> 1348.919
genuinely trying to do the right thing

1344.26 --> 1355.429
trying to create peace and good trade

1348.919 --> 1359.3600000000001
relations and hopefully we try to help

1355.429 --> 1362.0
cultures strengthen human rights that

1359.36 --> 1364.01
kind of thing yeah that's what a good

1362.0 --> 1367.13
diplomat should be doing and that's very

1364.01 --> 1370.73
respectable for me Mike you know yeah

1367.13 --> 1371.929
the person like that that would inspire

1370.73 --> 1374.33
our to me

1371.929 --> 1379.01
definitely though they are a part of

1374.33 --> 1383.1789999999999
government because yeah but what do they

1379.01 --> 1388.46
all do they all have like secrets all of

1383.179 --> 1392.7800000000002
them that like it always makes me wonder

1388.46 --> 1395.47
like the whole concept of like that

1392.78 --> 1397.9089999999999
there's these evil satanic cults and

1395.47 --> 1401.09
sacrifices know that I'm not gonna go

1397.909 --> 1401.8100000000002
into detail you know what I mean that's

1401.09 --> 1403.79
out there

1401.81 --> 1406.22
and that's blackmailing all government

1403.79 --> 1408.52
and everything like do these diplomats

1406.22 --> 1411.23
that even try to do the good thing also

1408.52 --> 1414.44
are forced to get involved in that

1411.23 --> 1422.51
doesn't be extremely sad and man how to

1414.44 --> 1425.93
deal with that [ __ ] like probably

1422.51 --> 1430.42
difficult is there a possibility to

1425.93 --> 1434.15
evade that how wide is this this dark

1430.42 --> 1437.45
organization or I guess killed off just

1434.15 --> 1440.3000000000002
loose crazy people how big is that even

1437.45 --> 1443.51
is it really completely world wide or is

1440.3 --> 1448.75
it like some regions they're there other

1443.51 --> 1448.75
regions they are specifically not cause

1449.2 --> 1454.67
yeah they couldn't get the culture

1451.69 --> 1456.5900000000001
locally or whatever to to not reject

1454.67 --> 1459.5600000000002
them or theirs so a couple of people out

1456.59 --> 1461.84
there that are just real guardians that

1459.56 --> 1464.03
you've refused to be corrupted what are

1461.84 --> 1466.9299999999998
also resourceful and have connections

1464.03 --> 1470.18
and so they just can't get in there

1466.93 --> 1472.7
what's really going on in this world I'm

1470.18 --> 1474.8300000000002
still doing that you know you can always

1472.7 --> 1477.14
over generalize everything so it was oh

1474.83 --> 1480.26
it's always this group or they are all

1477.14 --> 1484.1200000000001
this but everything is always like a

1480.26 --> 1489.11
fractal much more complicated with

1484.12 --> 1491.81
people of left hand right hand path any

1489.11 --> 1493.58
direction in all these groups there oh

1491.81 --> 1496.55
and they always will have their own

1493.58 --> 1500.26
challenges and some will eventually

1496.55 --> 1505.07
corrupt over time and some will actually

1500.26 --> 1508.46
be shocked into waking up to and just

1505.07 --> 1511.37
like spontaneous very serious repentance

1508.46 --> 1513.47
that can happen people can like change

1511.37 --> 1516.4399999999998
their character completely if the

1513.47 --> 1519.4
pressure just goes too deep or too

1516.44 --> 1522.53
sudden they can go nuts as well with

1519.4 --> 1528.0800000000002
yeah you know sufficient pressure can

1522.53 --> 1531.59
cause a lot of things but everything is

1528.08 --> 1534.99
much more complex and good and evil are

1531.59 --> 1537.9599999999998
never as black and white

1534.99 --> 1539.61
as we would conveniently like to think

1537.96 --> 1543.8700000000001
and that doesn't mean that everything is

1539.61 --> 1547.62
gray and that evil people that dabble in

1543.87 --> 1548.1599999999999
evil deeds and are okay with it all

1547.62 --> 1551.1899999999998
right

1548.16 --> 1553.8600000000001
are like oh well you gotta consider that

1551.19 --> 1559.1100000000001
even they know that then you get into

1553.86 --> 1561.4499999999998
serious apologizing no that's that's too

1559.11 --> 1563.9699999999998
far that's like that's overly liberal

1561.45 --> 1568.0800000000002
that's insane people are evil they are

1563.97 --> 1572.16
really evil but there is no good person

1568.08 --> 1576.3899999999999
that's never done anything yeah evil

1572.16 --> 1579.51
even by accident or just checking out

1576.39 --> 1581.0700000000002
and in a very bad situation causing ugly

1579.51 --> 1585.23
you know all these kind of things happen

1581.07 --> 1585.23
to people especially in their youth and

1585.35 --> 1589.02
engaging if they try things out if

1587.52 --> 1592.02
they're curious and nature [ __ ] will

1589.02 --> 1594.78
happen and they will accidentally get

1592.02 --> 1596.37
caught into things so it always happens

1594.78 --> 1602.25
to everyone no matter how good you are

1596.37 --> 1605.28
in nature and at the same time all evil

1602.25 --> 1607.53
people or evil people most people that

1605.28 --> 1610.02
do actually allow themselves to be

1607.53 --> 1614.25
corrupted they will always have good

1610.02 --> 1617.46
weaknesses and if they don't then they

1614.25 --> 1621.95
tend to completely lose their minds like

1617.46 --> 1626.78
for example Hillary Clinton was clearly

1621.95 --> 1629.7
like rejects love so systematically I

1626.78 --> 1633.21
think it's even said that she does that

1629.7 --> 1635.55
I don't know so many rumors out there

1633.21 --> 1638.3700000000001
it's hard to even tell but if I assume

1635.55 --> 1640.95
that she would be the way s is described

1638.37 --> 1643.62
that she just completely vanished love

1640.95 --> 1645.63
like a pure Satanist or whatever you

1643.62 --> 1648.12
want to call it out there and that will

1645.63 --> 1651.8700000000001
drive you insane there's nobody you

1648.12 --> 1657.4499999999998
connecting with your being a human with

1651.87 --> 1661.9099999999999
them yeah you will go insane it will

1657.45 --> 1666.179
become unstable or erratic or maniacal

1661.91 --> 1668.48
these are the typical elements that when

1666.179 --> 1671.48
that happens

1668.48 --> 1671.48
anyway

1679.539 --> 1682.519
all right two runs awesome there's a

1681.769 --> 1685.07
good comment

1682.519 --> 1687.049
it says terribly complicated yes if we

1685.07 --> 1690.47
insist on breaking it down like that

1687.049 --> 1694.46
well the thing is that is what's really

1690.47 --> 1696.1100000000001
going on so yeah if you just want to

1694.46 --> 1699.44
talk about it superficially give

1696.11 --> 1702.2299999999998
somebody you like a clear-cut basic

1699.44 --> 1704.48
diagram as it were what's going on yeah

1702.23 --> 1707.989
you could oversimplify say oh this is

1704.48 --> 1710.509
that all the rulers all are into this

1707.989 --> 1714.559
yeah you could oversimplify it to keep

1710.509 --> 1717.2
it simple but yeah if you actually want

1714.559 --> 1720.44
to come closer to doing something about

1717.2 --> 1723.529
it then you can to oversimplify it like

1720.44 --> 1726.0700000000002
that you have to get real because you're

1723.529 --> 1729.049
dealing with reality you're not just

1726.07 --> 1731.45
conceptualizing it in your mind see

1729.049 --> 1738.83
that's the problem and I'm trying to

1731.45 --> 1741.5900000000001
move closer I I really want to use my

1738.83 --> 1744.619
insight and my knowledge and my spirit

1741.59 --> 1747.859
to get things changed in the West best

1744.619 --> 1751.009
way possible not just talk about it like

1747.859 --> 1754.82
I guess with with my rectangular looping

1751.009 --> 1759.799
model for example yeah I at this time

1754.82 --> 1762.59
just talking about all I can do but when

1759.799 --> 1765.1689999999999
it comes to societal changes there is a

1762.59 --> 1767.149
lot happening and technology there is a

1765.169 --> 1769.999
lot there is so much happening and that

1767.149 --> 1777.139
we can interact with and have influence

1769.999 --> 1780.739
on it's very directly that we can use to

1777.139 --> 1783.9189999999999
make new concepts new ideas with that

1780.739 --> 1787.1000000000001
will naturally because of the grow it

1783.919 --> 1790.159
just keeps on going the inspiration the

1787.1 --> 1792.98
new things keep on coming they will they

1790.159 --> 1795.0800000000002
might actually catch on just by

1792.98 --> 1797.809
sprouting up somebody might catch it

1795.08 --> 1799.97
apply it and then suddenly yeah that

1797.809 --> 1802.19
good idea will suddenly become part of

1799.97 --> 1804.2
the technological revolution or whatever

1802.19 --> 1806.269
and that's always a good thing because

1804.2 --> 1810.98
if things are better it's always good

1806.269 --> 1816.59
you know like would it be better

1810.98 --> 1821.57
it was left out no so anyway I'm losing

1816.59 --> 1825.76
track was I was talking about shame walk

1821.57 --> 1825.76
Walter caught his worm but for you

1838.61 --> 1846.6399999999999
hmm right did we read and check says the

1844.07 --> 1849.799
Adam and Eve story scares a nerd like me

1846.64 --> 1858.919
cause I want to know everything why

1849.799 --> 1861.11
would that scare you but why right well

1858.919 --> 1863.24
but why then you're going into

1861.11 --> 1867.769
philosophical reasons and that is why

1863.24 --> 1872.48
did God create it and why did God

1867.769 --> 1876.2
created man why did God basically

1872.48 --> 1884.0
designate man to be the ruler or the

1876.2 --> 1888.6490000000001
arno ruler of the world right why did he

1884.0 --> 1892.539
do that well because apparently God made

1888.649 --> 1896.57
man in His image it's like a

1892.539 --> 1900.649
extra-dimensional offspring I guess to

1896.57 --> 1902.6899999999998
him another part of him like father

1900.649 --> 1905.4799999999998
would have a son and the son would be

1902.69 --> 1908.539
another part of him to him and that's

1905.48 --> 1909.7
how he made it he is God he is all about

1908.539 --> 1914.09
assumingly

1909.7 --> 1917.44
all-knowing all that and yeah if you

1914.09 --> 1922.1299999999999
know everything then what is there left

1917.44 --> 1924.71
so I would naturally then conclude that

1922.13 --> 1927.169
you would try to experience it from

1924.71 --> 1928.25
another direction it's almost like like

1927.169 --> 1930.8890000000001
playing a video game

1928.25 --> 1934.61
once you played through it yeah you know

1930.889 --> 1936.309
it now but does that mean that you know

1934.61 --> 1938.57
everything about it

1936.309 --> 1940.8799999999999
that you don't want to experience it

1938.57 --> 1943.34
again or look it through another angle

1940.88 --> 1945.679
approach it from another angle no so you

1943.34 --> 1947.779
can just start it up again and yeah even

1945.679 --> 1949.909
though you know what's going on how it

1947.779 --> 1952.25
works the rough lines or some of them

1949.909 --> 1954.5
you can still play it again so maybe

1952.25 --> 1958.37
it's like that maybe just God created

1954.5 --> 1963.049
man to experience the world from a more

1958.37 --> 1967.2199999999998
limited perspective and then combining

1963.049 --> 1970.389
all of this and to enrich him basically

1967.22 --> 1970.3890000000001
in the total experience

1972.79 --> 1977.11
that does make a lot of sense to me

1980.95 --> 1985.1100000000001
I hope it does make the sense to you

1989.03 --> 1999.12
but yeah it seems that through the story

1993.78 --> 2002.059
of creation and I have to add to that

1999.12 --> 2004.7299999999998
that we have no absolute confirmation

2002.059 --> 2008.51
that it is completely true although it

2004.73 --> 2012.14
is probably the best we have to go on at

2008.51 --> 2017.59
the time there are other myths of course

2012.14 --> 2020.39
of how the world came into being but

2017.59 --> 2027.1399999999999
yeah what else do we really have to go

2020.39 --> 2029.179
on you know would you go with a it has

2027.14 --> 2032.5700000000002
always been there and just constantly

2029.179 --> 2034.63
changing and nobody knows where it came

2032.57 --> 2034.6299999999999
from

2036.07 --> 2046.6699999999998
yeah I I proposed it and yeah it's yeah

2043.21 --> 2048.889
by default it is based on the amnesia of

2046.67 --> 2054.26
time like yeah if things are long enough

2048.889 --> 2058.879
ago then would you ever know could you

2054.26 --> 2065.5400000000004
ever figure it out that it was there you

2058.879 --> 2070.46
know maybe up to a certain time ago yeah

2065.54 --> 2075.0099999999998
things will be will stay in shape we'll

2070.46 --> 2078.86
have remnants of its original conception

2075.01 --> 2082.19
but yeah when enough time passes things

2078.86 --> 2086.3
will deteriorate things will break up

2082.19 --> 2090.29
will scatter will be become part of

2086.3 --> 2093.6200000000003
these the cycle of life in the world

2090.29 --> 2095.6
basically so if things are yeah who

2093.62 --> 2099.58
knows maybe it's a freaking million

2095.6 --> 2105.86
years ago there were like other beings

2099.58 --> 2109.0699999999997
yeah you know in my original setup for

2105.86 --> 2111.58
the world like the ad Alumnus which was

2109.07 --> 2115.1600000000003
pretty much right after creation

2111.58 --> 2117.3199999999997
assuming that creation must have

2115.16 --> 2119.33
happened so that's always gonna start

2117.32 --> 2121.1000000000004
out with that and yeah just go back to

2119.33 --> 2125.39
the my flatter talk hangouts about

2121.1 --> 2128.24
that and any age of one there's nobody

2125.39 --> 2129.74
knows how long this could have been and

2128.24 --> 2131.87
anything could have happened

2129.74 --> 2135.43
so yeah who knows maybe it was a freakin

2131.87 --> 2137.8399999999997
million years who the hell knows

2135.43 --> 2141.6499999999996
you know once a certain level of

2137.84 --> 2144.08
destruction is applied then doesn't

2141.65 --> 2150.44
matter how long ago it is there's just

2144.08 --> 2153.59
not gonna be any trace left no matter

2150.44 --> 2157.88
how old it is like yeah especially if

2153.59 --> 2160.04
it's a fiery Cataclysm and yeah

2157.88 --> 2163.73
everything is just going to be destroyed

2160.04 --> 2168.29
and yeah you can't carbon-date anything

2163.73 --> 2170.48
from before that fiery classicism has

2168.29 --> 2173.06
happened so almost anything would be

2170.48 --> 2176.36
destroyed unless for some possible

2173.06 --> 2179.93
reason it was hidden deep inside the

2176.36 --> 2183.35
earth beneath rock deep enough to beast

2179.93 --> 2186.5
be protected from a fiery Cataclysm of

2183.35 --> 2190.19
unknown proportions you don't know how

2186.5 --> 2193.25
heavy that went although yes some things

2190.19 --> 2195.2000000000003
must have survived otherwise yeah there

2193.25 --> 2198.53
would be nothing left so it should not

2195.2 --> 2201.8799999999997
be all consuming up world penetrating

2198.53 --> 2204.4700000000003
really so deep fiery Cataclysm

2201.88 --> 2208.07
but yeah the age of Wonders could have

2204.47 --> 2210.3799999999997
lasted a hundred years could have lasted

2208.07 --> 2216.6400000000003
a thousand could have lasted it in the

2210.38 --> 2216.6400000000003
million years there's no way to tell

2219.849 --> 2232.509
okay I'd see Oh Alan Chris Barrie Jessa

2227.839 --> 2232.509
Conda Karen be good see you in chat

2242.98 --> 2251.23
what is that Allenby asks a weird

2246.16 --> 2256.41
question am I going for the image Yuri

2251.23 --> 2256.41
look I have no idea who or what that is

2277.789 --> 2286.849
it's a rainy outside not too bad though

2283.609 --> 2286.8489999999997
it's cold

2288.89 --> 2300.2599999999998
the summer would come back mm-hmm okay

2300.349 --> 2306.6800000000003
right Bambi says he's apparently some

2303.99 --> 2306.68
singer

2322.2 --> 2324.77
yeah

2327.93 --> 2336.23
oh dear so I guess you're referring to

2333.9 --> 2342.299
the guy with the mustache in that band

2336.23 --> 2348.539
mm-hmm no its first time I'm seeing that

2342.299 --> 2353.0099999999998
and although it's not bad seeing worse

2348.539 --> 2354.4500000000003
no I'm just trying stuff out this is

2353.01 --> 2361.0200000000004
like the first time I've even had a

2354.45 --> 2367.71
mustache but I'm still not sure I don't

2361.02 --> 2369.63
know what I can do with it on the other

2367.71 --> 2373.799
hand yeah with this weather it's kind of

2369.63 --> 2380.549
nice having a mustache that's helped a

2373.799 --> 2382.89
bit against cold so maybe I'll just keep

2380.549 --> 2386.15
it throughout the winter and then in the

2382.89 --> 2386.15
spring see if I still like it

2415.62 --> 2421.37
you know if you want if you want me to

2418.5 --> 2426.87
speak in my native language then you

2421.37 --> 2428.3399999999997
need somebody to speak in my native

2426.87 --> 2432.38
language to me otherwise

2428.34 --> 2432.38
yeah I'm just it's just weird

2439.13 --> 2448.239
my favorite video game I think well at

2445.219 --> 2450.829
least people are asking questions ma'am

2448.239 --> 2452.66
that was really hard in the earlier Flat

2450.829 --> 2455.2690000000002
Earth talks I was like all people just

2452.66 --> 2458.209
asking please ask me some questions and

2455.269 --> 2460.279
people are just like really like kids in

2458.209 --> 2462.229
class like trying to like figure out

2460.279 --> 2466.219
what a good question could be because

2462.229 --> 2468.1699999999996
they just couldn't I guess they couldn't

2466.219 --> 2472.94
really grab the material as well back

2468.17 --> 2475.099
then as they can now but yeah people

2472.94 --> 2477.079
asking questions good so what is my

2475.099 --> 2480.589
favorite video game well my favorite

2477.079 --> 2482.3900000000003
video game but a very careful thought

2480.589 --> 2485.15
about it and it would have to definitely

2482.39 --> 2495.859
be baldur's gate the baldur's gate

2485.15 --> 2499.339
series and why well because it's D&D or

2495.859 --> 2502.239
start it's what got me into the indie it

2499.339 --> 2505.19
has very interesting characters and

2502.239 --> 2508.64
character actors as Cleve the speakers

2505.19 --> 2510.949
very good voice actors in it the the

2508.64 --> 2515.9
story is really fascinating and

2510.949 --> 2519.6800000000003
well-written and the artwork is good and

2515.9 --> 2523.789
what most importantly the music for its

2519.68 --> 2528.279
time it's astounding but they did with

2523.789 --> 2532.4
music it's like full-blown pom pom

2528.279 --> 2535.309
bombastic Orchestra with chorus and

2532.4 --> 2540.4100000000003
everything and it is really well themed

2535.309 --> 2542.599
it's I yep don't get me on this but it

2540.41 --> 2546.1299999999997
is like on par with like the Star Wars

2542.599 --> 2550.239
theme although that is really pure

2546.13 --> 2555.17
classical this is like more Roman

2550.239 --> 2559.729
medieval style I guess in its steam but

2555.17 --> 2562.16
glorious and really well fast in its

2559.729 --> 2564.229
spectrum the music the action music just

2562.16 --> 2567.41
a regular music back from this it's like

2564.229 --> 2569.479
it really good movie music that guides

2567.41 --> 2570.6299999999997
the entire game and the game itself is

2569.479 --> 2575.0389999999998
pretty

2570.63 --> 2576.7400000000002
see but the music makes it awesome and I

2575.039 --> 2580.039
love it I've played it so many times

2576.74 --> 2589.74
geez it's insane

2580.039 --> 2591.2400000000002
they'd probably like 400 times now yeah

2589.74 --> 2592.9199999999996
it's a good game and the music is

2591.24 --> 2594.93
awesome I really do

2592.92 --> 2599.46
keep on playing it for the music again

2594.93 --> 2601.14
again so that's my favorite game there's

2599.46 --> 2603.9
other games that are really good too but

2601.14 --> 2616.339
yeah this game is one of the oldest that

2603.9 --> 2618.9300000000003
I still keep on playing anyway alright

2616.339 --> 2622.97
one source and now asking a loaded

2618.93 --> 2627.589
question load it get it school shootings

2622.97 --> 2632.7889999999998
crisis actors see the thing or no yeah

2627.589 --> 2635.49
but again it's not as oversimplified as

2632.789 --> 2638.96
people really tend to assume because

2635.49 --> 2642.029
it's not always the exact same scenario

2638.96 --> 2642.75
sometimes a crowd is in on it sometimes

2642.029 --> 2646.65
they are not

2642.75 --> 2653.609
and sometimes [ __ ] does really happen

2646.65 --> 2657.839
and they then the media then fabricates

2653.609 --> 2660.99
a almost prefab level story afterward to

2657.839 --> 2663.15
propagandize it so yeah it's all over

2660.99 --> 2665.22
the place what's going on and there is a

2663.15 --> 2669.15
lot of fake things going on but not

2665.22 --> 2671.009
everything is fake so yeah if you really

2669.15 --> 2672.9900000000002
want to know what's faking what is it

2671.009 --> 2679.099
you gotta have to make it your hobby and

2672.99 --> 2683.069
try not to go and sing stay really sharp

2679.099 --> 2684.569
watch it like a detective but not in a

2683.069 --> 2687.18
childish way you got to be really

2684.569 --> 2688.71
careful what you're going to assume if

2687.18 --> 2693.93
you really want to figure out what's

2688.71 --> 2699.119
going on and so many things can be going

2693.93 --> 2701.3999999999996
on and not for agendas being unfolded

2699.119 --> 2703.08
even unwitting of each other

2701.4 --> 2707.7000000000003
at the same time in certain

2703.08 --> 2711.84
aspect so double-cross agendas of so

2707.7 --> 2716.0099999999998
many things but yeah it is a thing

2711.84 --> 2719.13
definitely and almost seems like they're

2716.01 --> 2723.2400000000002
ramping it up they're increasing the

2719.13 --> 2731.28
amounts and really trying to push it in

2723.24 --> 2736.8599999999997
everyone's face agitating but yeah it

2731.28 --> 2739.7400000000002
does happen definitely does but there

2736.86 --> 2745.71
are signs to look out for how you

2739.74 --> 2748.4399999999996
recognize a typical crisis act oh wait I

2745.71 --> 2750.36
really nothing happened to something

2748.44 --> 2752.1
where things did happen because things

2750.36 --> 2755.15
that did happen they will have remnants

2752.1 --> 2758.25
and they will probably be visual

2755.15 --> 2760.56
recognizable it's just like you

2758.25 --> 2763.17
recognize a real scene where real [ __ ]

2760.56 --> 2765.39
happens very quickly also by the people

2763.17 --> 2768.2400000000002
that were there if if the journalists

2765.39 --> 2771.3599999999997
are there quick enough because you can

2768.24 --> 2774.3799999999997
fake real stuff being really startled

2771.36 --> 2777.6600000000003
you can't fake that most people can't

2774.38 --> 2780.96
especially the standard basic cheap

2777.66 --> 2783.06
prices actors can so you can't fake that

2780.96 --> 2787.4700000000003
but it doesn't mean that it couldn't

2783.06 --> 2791.2799999999997
have been like in a in act in which the

2787.47 --> 2795.98
public was just not informed especially

2791.28 --> 2798.42
in no gun zones we have acting a fake

2795.98 --> 2800.82
robbery or whatever is going to be

2798.42 --> 2803.03
pretty easy because at least nobody's

2800.82 --> 2806.4
going to accidentally shoot the actors

2803.03 --> 2809.1600000000003
see and you can even put in the act with

2806.4 --> 2812.9100000000003
with fake guns that somebody would be

2809.16 --> 2815.3999999999996
killed or shot and then it's reported

2812.91 --> 2817.74
and they are brought to the to the

2815.4 --> 2820.44
hospital and they could walk walk away

2817.74 --> 2823.3199999999997
without a problem that kind of all these

2820.44 --> 2826.11
things are possible if they wanted to do

2823.32 --> 2828.3300000000004
it so is that going on or you have to

2826.11 --> 2830.88
dig deep to figure it out if that is

2828.33 --> 2832.95
really going on to take a look at every

2830.88 --> 2834.73
footage take a look as many reports as

2832.95 --> 2838.48
you can

2834.73 --> 2841.06
and see is there real things here or is

2838.48 --> 2843.88
it just a lot of footage of police cars

2841.06 --> 2847.48
big buses standing around with

2843.88 --> 2849.4300000000003
flickering lights and people just

2847.48 --> 2851.92
looking from a distance is that it

2849.43 --> 2858.25
that's no sign at all that something

2851.92 --> 2864.82
reals happened at all that's yeah you

2858.25 --> 2866.41
should see a lot more people like yeah

2864.82 --> 2868.81
you got to see the wounded people

2866.41 --> 2871.72
basically that's if you see that that

2868.81 --> 2873.19
and then yeah those could be crisis

2871.72 --> 2874.6899999999996
actors as well so you have to look

2873.19 --> 2877.27
careful what are you looking at is this

2874.69 --> 2879.28
resource is easily affected they really

2877.27 --> 2882.28
look like they're seriously wounded are

2879.28 --> 2885.369
they in shock how is their their

2882.28 --> 2886.9300000000003
condition how's their eyes you know if

2885.369 --> 2889.359
they're really wounded you will know

2886.93 --> 2892.18
absolutely your mistake could be almost

2889.359 --> 2894.46
embarrassingly obviously will feel yeah

2892.18 --> 2897.609
that's real it's very uncomfortable

2894.46 --> 2899.46
if it's an act then things will look out

2897.609 --> 2901.839
of place and you would just see like

2899.46 --> 2905.109
this doesn't this is stupid

2901.839 --> 2909.19
and I had this experience and they'll

2905.109 --> 2912.5499999999997
just put it out there at the the the

2909.19 --> 2915.4
Manchester attack and there's so much

2912.55 --> 2918.4
controversy surrounding it but there was

2915.4 --> 2922.03
a footage of crisis acting in there very

2918.4 --> 2925.03
upfront and the show and that was so

2922.03 --> 2927.9
incredibly embarrassing me fake just

2925.03 --> 2930.579
like oh my god you do this really and

2927.9 --> 2932.77
yeah it's gonna freak out little kids

2930.579 --> 2935.4300000000003
for sure because they can tell but I

2932.77 --> 2935.43
can't

2939.3 --> 2946.26
absolutely ridiculous oh that's is one

2942.51 --> 2948.78
of the events that I am adamant about

2946.26 --> 2952.46
that that was absolutely fake and

2948.78 --> 2955.8900000000003
everyone was included almost everyone or

2952.46 --> 2958.05
they just didn't give [ __ ] they just

2955.89 --> 2959.94
also assumed it was a public stunt which

2958.05 --> 2964.98
it was and just played along because -

2959.94 --> 2967.71
oh yeah you gotta help out the

2964.98 --> 2971.46
government or whatever who knows how

2967.71 --> 2973.83
that really unfolded but it was more

2971.46 --> 2976.34
than obvious that a lot of people a lot

2973.83 --> 2980.16
of youth that were present there in that

2976.34 --> 2985.38
event were in on it it's very obvious

2980.16 --> 2987.8399999999997
and one of the more obvious examples of

2985.38 --> 2991.1400000000003
this being visible contrast to many

2987.84 --> 2992.67
other events and shootings not so

2991.14 --> 2995.0099999999998
straightforward and there's more complex

2992.67 --> 3000.38
elements to it sometimes okay ultra

2995.01 --> 3002.15
angle and move yeah so the bill was a

3000.38 --> 3002.9900000000002
little bit of false flags let's not get

3002.15 --> 3008.03
too much into it

3002.99 --> 3011.109
yeah annoying subject fascinating but

3008.03 --> 3011.1090000000004
also annoying

3014.95 --> 3024.979
right we've got 10 more minutes

3017.479 --> 3030.049
nobody joining hi so just like run round

3024.979 --> 3034.509
out the show a little bit earlier this

3030.049 --> 3034.509
damn weather looking forward to that

3043.69 --> 3051.4900000000002
all right I'm getting some feedback on

3045.73 --> 3053.859
the Manchester interesting anyway there

3051.49 --> 3056.1699999999996
has already been so much said you know I

3053.859 --> 3059.5789999999997
went through it with vegan warrior back

3056.17 --> 3063.609
in the day when his channel was still

3059.579 --> 3066.6090000000004
doing that yeah but pretty much after

3063.609 --> 3067.92
that the false flag censorship started

3066.609 --> 3073.5989999999997
up big time

3067.92 --> 3075.849
big big big time so yeah he's not that

3073.599 --> 3077.6800000000003
active that I know maybe he did maybe

3075.849 --> 3084.1600000000003
he's just keep on making new channels

3077.68 --> 3089.64
but I can't keep track of it it's some

3084.16 --> 3092.319
time ago now but yeah I don't wanna

3089.64 --> 3095.3799999999997
spend a lot of time on that subject

3092.319 --> 3099.49
although I will give my opinion about it

3095.38 --> 3102.94
and do yeah what I just shared with you

3099.49 --> 3105.0099999999998
guys that it's not always just one

3102.94 --> 3107.2000000000003
unified monolithic thing that's always

3105.01 --> 3109.8100000000004
happening there's several angles to it

3107.2 --> 3112.359
several different layers of things that

3109.81 --> 3114.94
could be happening and how you recognize

3112.359 --> 3118.7799999999997
these elements so good to keep in mind

3114.94 --> 3125.81
when looking at the news and getting

3118.78 --> 3142.8500000000004
into these events yeah

3125.81 --> 3146.06
Oh What did he say about the Glovers you

3142.85 --> 3148.22
know if they're in chat and just let

3146.06 --> 3151.7599999999998
them be asses as long as they don't get

3148.22 --> 3152.33
really nasty or disgusting just leave

3151.76 --> 3160.15
him be

3152.33 --> 3160.15
no that's all so

3164.81 --> 3167.44
right

3179.619 --> 3193.839
well people are getting really Ricky and

3183.039 --> 3197.079
gent here uh-huh yeah I know Karen but

3193.839 --> 3199.989
look the way I deal with this with chat

3197.079 --> 3202.299
usually is and just let everybody do

3199.989 --> 3204.9990000000003
their due and if they're like really

3202.299 --> 3207.45
obviously in your face disgusting then

3204.999 --> 3211.479
I'll just remove them or block them and

3207.45 --> 3211.739
usually am I headed a little here and

3211.479 --> 3215.049
there

3211.739 --> 3218.68
afterward if it is if I see it's

3215.049 --> 3221.829
necessary but I prefer just not like as

3218.68 --> 3225.009
moderators I'm giving you it rather too

3221.829 --> 3226.7490000000003
so that you can put out links rather

3225.009 --> 3229.749
than moderate because I don't think I

3226.749 --> 3232.2099999999996
really need moderation that much Chad's

3229.749 --> 3234.279
been pretty nice to me despite all the

3232.21 --> 3237.549
trolls they seem to be leaving me alone

3234.279 --> 3240.779
I guess they really know how far they

3237.549 --> 3243.549
can go now and that if they go too far

3240.779 --> 3246.369
yeah they can pretend like nothing's go

3243.549 --> 3248.89
on or I will block them but it seems

3246.369 --> 3253.7690000000002
yeah my Chad's been pretty nice in the

3248.89 --> 3257.19
last month now so I like it
