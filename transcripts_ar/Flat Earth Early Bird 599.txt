little early compensate for yesterday ah

140.84 --> 148.8
though yeah I'm a bit off my system here

146.76 --> 152.84
anyway yeah the weather again turned

148.8 --> 155.34
around and it's now kind of beautiful I

152.84 --> 157.17000000000002
thought this morning that it was gonna

155.34 --> 163.82
be all cloudy again but apparently not

157.17 --> 163.82
so this time not so much at least

166.33 --> 173.67000000000002
so it's actually kind of nice and sunny

168.37 --> 176.61
right now hope that's gonna keep keep up

173.67 --> 179.73999999999998
have to do my newspaper rounds later

176.61 --> 188.77
somewhere it would be nice if it stayed

179.74 --> 194.8
dry alright okay I see the weather in

188.77 --> 199.15
and in England is not so good still

194.8 --> 201.67000000000002
right well maybe you guys ill the good

199.15 --> 207.13
weather come we'll arrive later in the

201.67 --> 212.5
day I hope it for you guys anyway I feel

207.13 --> 215.04999999999998
a bit uh and I'll be sickish because

212.5 --> 222.79
like I had it really unusually late

215.05 --> 226.48000000000002
night up until 4:00 not exactly as

222.79 --> 229.23999999999998
planned but yeah it was pretty late

226.48 --> 232.45
already and then I caught up got caught

229.24 --> 235.66
up in a conversation with my roommate on

232.45 --> 242.92
the balcony over here and that talk

235.66 --> 244.81
lasted like almost two hours oh thank

242.92 --> 252.16
you dank thank you for the support I

244.81 --> 255.58
will check it later but yeah a little

252.16 --> 257.62
bit too much wine to drink over all too

255.58 --> 260.89
late so I don't feel all that great

257.62 --> 267.01
it'll recover it's not that bad it's

260.89 --> 269.88
just that a bit wobbly in but yeah I had

267.01 --> 274.87
a very long conversation basically

269.88 --> 279.31
showed her who I am including some of my

274.87 --> 284.47
more controversial sites looting what I

279.31 --> 289.57
do and about Flat Earth even and there

284.47 --> 293.29
was a yeah expected initial response she

289.57 --> 298.33
was kind of flexible about about it

293.29 --> 300.07
initially but when it eventually got to

298.33 --> 302.94899999999996
her attention like

300.07 --> 305.53
are you saying that those lights over

302.949 --> 307.78000000000003
there are not physical places while that

305.53 --> 310.38899999999995
weird are out but then when started to

307.78 --> 312.88
hit her like but there's like other

310.389 --> 315.96000000000004
people's on other planets right and all

312.88 --> 318.55
the aliens I was like nope

315.96 --> 323.289
not they're not like that

318.55 --> 325.78000000000003
and yet that kind of freaked her out and

323.289 --> 333.01
after that we kind of moved on into

325.78 --> 336.15999999999997
other subjects but yeah guess what guess

333.01 --> 337.199
what my original assessment of her was

336.16 --> 343.35
correct

337.199 --> 343.35
surprise surprise yeah she's a lesbian

344.34 --> 351.789
it's like wow

346.62 --> 354.94
remember I said like a week ago so it's

351.789 --> 359.889
everybody's a lesbian now well yeah yeah

354.94 --> 364.56
they really are freaky and I even kind

359.889 --> 368.08
of told it to her face like yeah I think

364.56 --> 370.24
homosexuality is a mistake then she got

368.08 --> 372.729
like really like what what what do you

370.24 --> 376.74
mean with that and then I tried to

372.729 --> 382.659
explain it from a creation perspective

376.74 --> 385.18
that it's not from a social idealist

382.659 --> 387.099
perspective telling you should not do

385.18 --> 389.949
that you should not do that but that

387.099 --> 392.889
it's rather a mistake from a natural

389.949 --> 397.0
perspective even though in nature there

392.889 --> 399.599
are yeah other social creatures that

397.0 --> 404.979
have homosexual behavior as well and

399.599 --> 407.32
sometimes they even sort of accompanying

404.979 --> 410.65
behavior that still manages to allow

407.32 --> 412.81
them to procreate despite that and we

410.65 --> 414.789
talked a bit about that to kind of

412.81 --> 418.36
soothe their nervous is that I said that

414.789 --> 420.4
but yeah I do hold my ground basically

418.36 --> 423.61
it is technically a mistake you could

420.4 --> 425.32
have yeah I didn't even go there by the

423.61 --> 428.65000000000003
way but in my mind it's like yeah you

425.32 --> 431.12
you could have chosen to ignore your

428.65 --> 432.73999999999995
initial suspicions and

431.12 --> 434.32
work on that it would be a struggle it

432.74 --> 437.54
would be a different type of struggle

434.32 --> 440.71999999999997
probably much harder in this world but

437.54 --> 444.71000000000004
eventually yeah then you might still get

440.72 --> 449.72
kids and then later figure out like okay

444.71 --> 454.43
maybe I'll go for the ladies after all

449.72 --> 455.81
or something or maybe it'll not be like

454.43 --> 459.979
that anymore because yeah when you have

455.81 --> 469.49
kids it really does something to your to

459.979 --> 472.15999999999997
your system also psychological right but

469.49 --> 475.22
yeah that was it was kind of interesting

472.16 --> 478.03900000000004
that I that at least she wasn't so

475.22 --> 482.15000000000003
easily triggered and [ __ ] she even

478.039 --> 483.53
though apparently she does she hanging

482.15 --> 490.01
around as though she just as worried

483.53 --> 493.09
good circles alright but I kind of made

490.01 --> 496.07
her well aware that yeah I am a

493.09 --> 499.48999999999995
fanatical anti-marxist what does that

496.07 --> 501.889
mean there's issues with that and the

499.49 --> 505.94
funny thing was she kind of agreed with

501.889 --> 507.95
me like she noticed those things those

505.94 --> 510.68
influences and she does regard them as

507.95 --> 512.3
like bad corporate influences and she

510.68 --> 514.669
even brought forth like yeah and this

512.3 --> 518.209
whole situation with the P being added

514.669 --> 521.419
on and first out she kind of started to

518.209 --> 526.3389999999999
automatically be apologist for it right

521.419 --> 527.87
towards me because she that's in sjw

526.339 --> 529.37
Circle she kind of have to do that if

527.87 --> 531.23
you're against it because people are

529.37 --> 535.16
like triggered about that and then I

531.23 --> 539.5600000000001
made it apparent to her like yeah I have

535.16 --> 541.12
very specific opinions about that and

539.56 --> 544.3699999999999
[Music]

541.12 --> 551.18
right so despite it all there is still

544.37 --> 555.5600000000001
like the way our spirit seems to work

551.18 --> 557.9
the spiritual chemistry seems similar in

555.56 --> 563.93
some ways which is odd because she's a

557.9 --> 564.6
girl right but it seems relatively easy

563.93 --> 567.5999999999999
for me

564.6 --> 569.37
communicate things to her even on a more

567.6 --> 572.009
complex spiritual level even though she

569.37 --> 574.589
doesn't really have the verbal capacity

572.009 --> 575.97
to put it down as eloquently as I

574.589 --> 578.399
typically can because I have the

575.97 --> 582.4200000000001
training for that she does have the

578.399 --> 586.56
intuition and you would have to because

582.42 --> 590.13
she is also like a sports trainer so she

586.56 --> 593.5189999999999
is like a has a teacher role towards

590.13 --> 597.4399999999999
other people you need to have spiritual

593.519 --> 600.63
instincts or you're gonna mess up so

597.44 --> 602.94
yeah that was kind of interesting it

600.63 --> 605.069
really kept me up very long and then

602.94 --> 607.589
Owen Benjamin started kind of right as I

605.069 --> 610.38
wanted to go to bed didn't finish

607.589 --> 613.6990000000001
watching it but yeah all of that kept me

610.38 --> 613.699
up extremely late

619.87 --> 622.53
right

628.79 --> 634.949
forth on this subject right

632.069 --> 636.689
well I okay sure if we're gonna expand

634.949 --> 639.449
on that like I also shared to her like

636.689 --> 641.04
yeah in the past people kind of like

639.449 --> 641.6099999999999
we're trying to push in me that I was

641.04 --> 646.319
gay

641.61 --> 658.98
and now I'm not like I really like girls

646.319 --> 661.889
and yeah I know let's move on oh yeah I

658.98 --> 663.72
watched the Red October hunt for the Red

661.889 --> 666.089
October haven't seen that in a long time

663.72 --> 669.749
was interesting to see that again what

666.089 --> 674.0690000000001
kind of movie it is and just some weird

669.749 --> 677.279
little like secret placements in there

674.069 --> 680.61
like this the odd odd situation about

677.279 --> 682.11
basically yeah party member puddin

680.61 --> 686.49
getting in there and then getting

682.11 --> 692.149
murdered that was like whoa that's kind

686.49 --> 695.79
of freaky like that was weird

692.149 --> 698.49
to see that old-school movie what well

695.79 --> 701.329
what's going on here what are you doing

698.49 --> 701.3290000000001
Tom Parker

706.66 --> 718.2199999999999
okay there right yeah yeah yeah Voynich

712.81 --> 720.55
that's that's bad yeah if you're here

718.22 --> 725.11
because you find me attractive

720.55 --> 725.1099999999999
then you're here for the wrong reasons

726.07 --> 738.08
it's not not worth a joke mm right yeah

734.36 --> 741.58
it is an old-school movie og and it's

738.08 --> 744.2
it's a pretty interesting movie and

741.58 --> 746.779
especially now that we have learned so

744.2 --> 750.2
much more about the control opposition

746.779 --> 752.75
situation in the deep state it's really

750.2 --> 755.48
interesting to see what they are doing

752.75 --> 761.23
in the movie it is really interesting

755.48 --> 763.04
from that perspective from a post-911

761.23 --> 766.279
deep state

763.04 --> 771.3199999999999
illuminati research the news how it

766.279 --> 773.62
works to see ya periscope don't work on

771.32 --> 773.62
a globe

775.69 --> 778.889
[Music]

783.32 --> 786.94
what were you on about

792.46 --> 797.5500000000001
why did you post woman what does that

795.19 --> 797.5500000000001
mean

808.17 --> 817.4399999999999
girl you mean my roommate well she is 26

814.11 --> 820.519
and she's kind of small so she really is

817.44 --> 820.519
like a girl to me

823.889 --> 831.239
I don't know I don't easily say woman to

827.1 --> 834.299
a woman unless they're like really to

831.239 --> 839.639
the level in the email impression on me

834.299 --> 841.889
I don't know I just these days there's a

839.639 --> 853.879
lot of girls around a lot of boys but

841.889 --> 853.879
they're very few men and women one word

862.48 --> 874.16
idea what you're talking about right

866.81 --> 878.3299999999999
anyway hmm yeah I actually wrote half a

874.16 --> 880.49
page of my book this morning like I

878.33 --> 884.99
wrote something but I kind of thought it

880.49 --> 887.99
was [ __ ] but I'm basically gonna start

884.99 --> 895.37
continuing doing that until I have a lot

887.99 --> 898.07
of stuff and then see what I can make of

895.37 --> 901.07
it I'm just gonna basically do filler

898.07 --> 905.3000000000001
and then see later what I can extract

901.07 --> 909.4300000000001
from it how I can rewrite it I'm doing

905.3 --> 909.43
it in English so far

914.0 --> 920.389
right it's just that it's really the

918.079 --> 922.9699999999999
freaking like how do I start it up so I

920.389 --> 925.069
just basically started in the middle of

922.97 --> 927.259
a sentence as if I were explaining a

925.069 --> 929.66
typical problem and try to put it down a

927.259 --> 932.36
little bit more elaborately and then I'm

929.66 --> 934.43
going to keep on seeing like how can I

932.36 --> 937.85
continue this basically try to make a

934.43 --> 940.31
giant blabbering piece that kind of

937.85 --> 944.149
touches upon the subjects to see what it

940.31 --> 949.0089999999999
will be and see like yeah I just have to

944.149 --> 956.629
study it my own writing as I go and I

949.009 --> 958.91
know the startup look the content is

956.629 --> 961.22
already in my mind I just don't know how

958.91 --> 964.55
to put it down and order it like how do

961.22 --> 968.48
I translate this for other people to

964.55 --> 970.0999999999999
read from a non-interactive perspective

968.48 --> 972.0500000000001
where I can't explain it

970.1 --> 973.639
re-explaining on the spot I have to put

972.05 --> 976.67
it all down in the paper and they have

973.639 --> 979.5790000000001
to get it all from that that's a tough

976.67 --> 982.55
one like I also even have to kind of

979.579 --> 984.3499999999999
build up an approach because yeah there

982.55 --> 986.569
will be people that are completely

984.35 --> 988.91
ignorant about this oh how do I make

986.569 --> 991.91
them get the really complicated end

988.91 --> 996.529
result I have to build it up all the

991.91 --> 999.74
step of the way every step of the way

996.529 --> 1002.459
what are you talking about 100 pound

999.74 --> 1002.4590000000001
fine what

1010.16 --> 1015.629
[Music]

1012.829 --> 1024.36
I'm a skinny okay shops became law

1015.629 --> 1025.6490000000001
second day oh goody yeah I still don't

1024.36 --> 1029.87
know about the fine though

1025.649 --> 1033.36
you know I'm starting to wonder really

1029.87 --> 1036.089
like it is said that people are getting

1033.36 --> 1038.339
fines I even asked her my roommate

1036.089 --> 1040.62
it's like yeah I know somebody who did

1038.339 --> 1044.85
get it I'm fine like how did they get it

1040.62 --> 1049.86
they got it through company policy not

1044.85 --> 1053.61
through law they got it through their

1049.86 --> 1056.7299999999998
company which means that they could have

1053.61 --> 1058.3799999999999
technically just refused it and then got

1056.73 --> 1061.74
in trouble with the company because then

1058.38 --> 1065.7600000000002
the company is responding but it's on

1061.74 --> 1068.94
them because they're not really allowed

1065.76 --> 1071.519

1068.94 --> 1076.98
policy and then suggesting it is part of

1071.519 --> 1078.8700000000001

right but I don't know in the

1189.78 --> 1215.28
Netherlands it's not really a problem I

1192.559 --> 1217.29
haven't seen any of this nonsense yeah I

1215.28 --> 1223.5
heard that Robin Stanley it's weird or

1217.29 --> 1226.74
you showed me in the pamphlet like like

1223.5 --> 1228.87
what are they gonna do like they'd have

1226.74 --> 1231.75
to have a warrant to even be allowed to

1228.87 --> 1234.6299999999999
get in so if you see it's just one of

1231.75 --> 1237.33
those fatty masks wearing police with

1234.63 --> 1246.0
the stupid little cars Corona Finers you

1237.33 --> 1247.1699999999998
just don't let him in to say no you have

1246.0 --> 1253.26
no business here

1247.17 --> 1255.8700000000001
you'll have no warrant [ __ ] off and some

1253.26 --> 1259.62
mandate or order from some stupid

1255.87 --> 1261.59
official is not a house is not a syringe

1259.62 --> 1266.01
search warrant or something like that

1261.59 --> 1271.8899999999999
that's not a court order so yeah [ __ ]

1266.01 --> 1273.9
off that's what I would do but yeah easy

1271.89 --> 1275.3700000000001
kind of for me to talk because I live in

1273.9 --> 1279.8400000000001
the Netherlands and it doesn't seem to

1275.37 --> 1282.27
be any issues in that direction like it

1279.84 --> 1284.3999999999999
like that in here even though they are

1282.27 --> 1288.42
trying to push all kinds of [ __ ] but

1284.4 --> 1291.0
everybody is really fed up with it and

1288.42 --> 1291.3000000000002
it's even become now kind of official

1291.0 --> 1293.46
that

1291.3 --> 1296.3899999999999
yeah the Prime Minister and this party

1293.46 --> 1299.55
is like has a major tanking like this

1296.39 --> 1303.5
the most unpopular he has been since

1299.55 --> 1306.45
he's been Prime Minister pretty much

1303.5 --> 1308.82
because of this because of specifically

1306.45 --> 1310.47
the corona [ __ ] and the climate

1308.82 --> 1314.37
change also and how he dealt with

1310.47 --> 1317.28
farmers and and everything but the other

1314.37 --> 1320.1599999999999
corona situation now he's still trying

1317.28 --> 1321.18
to push it is just like no everybody's

1320.16 --> 1325.52
just done with it

1321.18 --> 1325.52
here we all know it's [ __ ]

1343.51 --> 1353.7
all right anyway I'm gonna check PayPal

1375.74 --> 1378.58
yeah

1384.57 --> 1387.77
[Music]

1389.309 --> 1395.62
you hold a yeoman sorry this sounds

1393.67 --> 1396.52
silly okay but I literally don't know

1395.62 --> 1398.4399999999998
who that is

1396.52 --> 1399.429
although the name sounds halfway

1398.44 --> 1410.22
familiar

1399.429 --> 1413.22
I guess I'm googling I don't know oh god

1410.22 --> 1413.22
wait

1414.99 --> 1422.1
all right that guy wasn't he the guy

1417.929 --> 1423.1100000000001
that yeah they didn't want to have him

1422.1 --> 1425.49
win

1423.11 --> 1431.9099999999999
wasn't that him or wasn't that was that

1425.49 --> 1434.76
another guy so he made it through after

1431.91 --> 1440.19
all they they tried to force the force a

1434.76 --> 1442.62
revote because he he got out with the

1440.19 --> 1451.65
most votes if I remember correctly there

1442.62 --> 1457.1299999999999
was him so anyway look that the whole

1451.65 --> 1461.75
party CDA is just it's a mess it's a

1457.13 --> 1466.89
corporate virtue signaling Christian

1461.75 --> 1469.5
wannabe yeah just it's one of the big

1466.89 --> 1471.9
parties that is very susceptible to

1469.5 --> 1474.78
globalism and all that [ __ ]

1471.9 --> 1477.24
kind of always has been it's like we are

1474.78 --> 1487.27
the globalist Christian party almost

1477.24 --> 1490.18
sort of so yeah

1487.27 --> 1493.6
and in the past you know and it's a long

1490.18 --> 1495.8500000000001
time it was during the time of 9/11 like

1493.6 --> 1498.25
I even fell for it at a time because

1495.85 --> 1499.9599999999998
there was one prime minister who became

1498.25 --> 1503.26
prime minister later turning out to be

1499.96 --> 1506.05
like the biggest nerd and double

1503.26 --> 1507.8799999999999
speaking liar ever well not the biggest

1506.05 --> 1511.24
now because our current Prime Minister

1507.88 --> 1513.5500000000002
has topped that by far but at the time

1511.24 --> 1514.8700000000001
like he gave a great intro speech that

1513.55 --> 1517.54
was really like yeah we're gonna go

1514.87 --> 1519.37
really back to the old values and I

1517.54 --> 1522.7
bought it and a lot of people bought it

1519.37 --> 1524.9199999999998
and then when he got in power he just

1522.7 --> 1526.75
immediately became a globalist war

1524.92 --> 1530.77
monger and all that [ __ ] and a suck-up

1526.75 --> 1533.26
was terrible it's a major betrayal for

1530.77 --> 1538.45
me was like really the first sign that

1533.26 --> 1540.94
politics is just completely [ __ ] all

1538.45 --> 1543.79
right yeah well maybe the first moment

1540.94 --> 1546.73
was it wasn't after or before that I

1543.79 --> 1549.25
think before that it was pimp for time

1546.73 --> 1551.23
happened he was assassinated so that

1549.25 --> 1553.15
yeah there was an earlier sign I think

1551.23 --> 1557.17
or it could be an after I don't remember

1553.15 --> 1562.24
exactly when sorry guys you know which

1557.17 --> 1566.38
one was first but yeah the CDA it's it's

1562.24 --> 1571.54
just not Christian it's not not really

1566.38 --> 1573.64
and even the more serious Christian

1571.54 --> 1577.72
parties in the Netherlands are in the

1573.64 --> 1580.0300000000002
ends more just nitpicky Christians and

1577.72 --> 1583.54
not really getting the spirit of it not

1580.03 --> 1585.85
really realizing that just the bigger

1583.54 --> 1591.24
dangers of globalism and just the beast

1585.85 --> 1593.9499999999998
system and not addressing it properly so

1591.24 --> 1595.8700000000001
yeah in my opinion there's no real

1593.95 --> 1601.15
Christian parties in the Netherlands not

1595.87 --> 1602.8899999999999
really but it's almost impossible now

1601.15 --> 1605.77
just

1602.89 --> 1610.0300000000002
the way everything has been arranged the

1605.77 --> 1611.71
way the nation functions like it's all

1610.03 --> 1614.2
about the trade all about the business

1611.71 --> 1619.049
so global ISM globalism can make us

1614.2 --> 1622.5
great yeah it's just freaking great

1619.049 --> 1628.03
at the same time we're being just

1622.5 --> 1631.299
squeezed out of all sovereignty out of

1628.03 --> 1632.95
all self-reliance farmers getting

1631.299 --> 1635.02
attacked they want to turn it all into

1632.95 --> 1640.24
big city-states all of these parties all

1635.02 --> 1642.8799999999999
of the bigger ones and yeah to turn us

1640.24 --> 1647.22
into a globalist city-state that's gonna

1642.88 --> 1650.3200000000002
be completely dependent on globalism to

1647.22 --> 1652.72
survive literally for the people to

1650.32 --> 1658.12
survive and they are going to abuse it

1652.72 --> 1660.1000000000001
yeah it's going to happen just like or

1658.12 --> 1662.37
maybe a little bit dramatic but kind of

1660.1 --> 1666.76
just like what happened in Ukraine

1662.37 --> 1671.4399999999998
during the Soviet era that's exactly

1666.76 --> 1673.929
what it is you take control over the

1671.44 --> 1675.64
self-reliance you just confiscate under

1673.929 --> 1677.95
direct threat that's kind of how they

1675.64 --> 1680.3200000000002
did it well with us it's like yeah you

1677.95 --> 1684.01
give it away now you don't have it

1680.32 --> 1685.23
anymore and they're not allowing you to

1684.01 --> 1690.72
get it back

1685.23 --> 1694.41
making it too difficult so for me like

1690.72 --> 1697.929
my spiritual focus as it were with in

1694.41 --> 1700.929
politics when I'm I don't just outright

1697.929 --> 1705.3090000000002
a bad in it is to get the farming

1700.929 --> 1707.38
situation back and stable and real and

1705.309 --> 1712.4189999999999
get it sensible and just drop the

1707.38 --> 1715.39
freaking migration policy yeah for the

1712.419 --> 1720.51
immigration policy just it has to stop

1715.39 --> 1720.51
we have to start just

1720.78 --> 1730.36
start I guess giving people time for a

1726.01 --> 1733.6
breather and like refigure out our

1730.36 --> 1740.26
national identity for eve every person

1733.6 --> 1742.4499999999998
and yeah flourish again instead of just

1740.26 --> 1744.82
constantly following in the tracks of

1742.45 --> 1748.659
globalism and letting everyone be

1744.82 --> 1753.12
programmed with with stupid nonsense and

1748.659 --> 1755.71
useless skills that overall degrades

1753.12 --> 1761.53
just the culture and the quality of

1755.71 --> 1764.23
labor that comes out of it so that it

1761.53 --> 1766.87
has been my focus and I've heard there

1764.23 --> 1768.25
is like a party now that is specifically

1766.87 --> 1770.4699999999998
about the farmers it's interesting

1768.25 --> 1772.72
although it seems to me on the surface

1770.47 --> 1775.1200000000001
that it's mostly more an action

1772.72 --> 1777.669
committee that's getting political to

1775.12 --> 1780.6999999999998
stop the current situation but who knows

1777.669 --> 1783.97
where it'll grow into or if it will stop

1780.7 --> 1786.22
I will see anyway I'm not directly

1783.97 --> 1788.44
getting involved or contacting anyone if

1786.22 --> 1793.08
anybody was wondering that it's just all

1788.44 --> 1793.0800000000002
observation at a distance at this point

1793.289 --> 1801.07
my momma is ready for other input like

1796.809 --> 1806.97
hey if Roche has things to share about

1801.07 --> 1806.97
it it's always welcome

1809.94 --> 1814.75
and now maybe you know at this point

1812.53 --> 1816.3
maybe we could even do a show just you

1814.75 --> 1820.87
and me about it

1816.3 --> 1822.79
okay maybe even in Dutch maybe maybe we

1820.87 --> 1825.9399999999998
should do that if you are comfortable

1822.79 --> 1827.86
with that little bit it's not going to

1825.94 --> 1830.98
be on the early bird show though it's

1827.86 --> 1832.4499999999998
gonna have to be a separate thing but I

1830.98 --> 1837.4
think it would be interesting to have

1832.45 --> 1842.05
like a Dutch conversation about politics

1837.4 --> 1845.92
and a little bit yeah about Flat Earth

1842.05 --> 1849.55
in the Netherlands and like how is that

1845.92 --> 1851.02
working out know general stuff I really

1849.55 --> 1854.43
want to beat and make it about the

1851.02 --> 1858.25
Netherlands if we're going to do a Dutch

1854.43 --> 1861.94
anyway a little plan maybe somewhere the

1858.25 --> 1863.77
next week or who knows maybe later in

1861.94 --> 1868.0
the evening now probably not I have my

1863.77 --> 1870.43
newspaper round but yeah keep it in mind

1868.0 --> 1872.14
and yeah if I forget about it because

1870.43 --> 1874.3600000000001
that [ __ ] does happen I forget about

1872.14 --> 1875.71
these things like even if I do make

1874.36 --> 1878.07
notes and they're probably gonna make it

1875.71 --> 1878.07
now

1894.1 --> 1901.59
Yeah right no it is made not gonna

1896.8 --> 1904.12
forget this one so easily uh you know

1901.59 --> 1905.83
maybe somewhere in the afternoon or

1904.12 --> 1907.6599999999999
evening we could do that sometime and

1905.83 --> 1910.51
yeah if I don't bring it up again then

1907.66 --> 1914.71
you can remind me especially if you're

1910.51 --> 1916.23
like really up to it because with me

1914.71 --> 1921.55
[Music]

1916.23 --> 1923.53
yeah usually unless I'm like really in

1921.55 --> 1926.2
the evening and I'm like toasty and all

1923.53 --> 1929.3799999999999
that and tired then I'm not really good

1926.2 --> 1931.39
for that but in all the other times of

1929.38 --> 1933.2800000000002
the day usually am including really

1931.39 --> 1936.88
early in the morning by the way if you

1933.28 --> 1938.92
are up for such a thing but and when I

1936.88 --> 1941.0700000000002

[Music]

2007.35 --> 2013.74
yeah alright I think I've pretty much

2010.419 --> 2013.74
went through the entire notes

mm-hmm

2046.27 --> 2052.06

2061.21 --> 2067.4700000000003
in a chat without doing that and

2063.1 --> 2067.47

2089.97 --> 2093.2999999999997
deal with it

2103.8 --> 2110.28
and I don't care how much people like

2106.78 --> 2110.28
you I really don't care

2112.12 --> 2115.2799999999997
[Music]

2122.15 --> 2131.339
banned for being an advertisement board

2125.309 --> 2133.559
for his stupid religion he is like a

2131.339 --> 2137.19
baller except he's an inside-out baller

2133.559 --> 2140.01
but other than that is exactly that and

2137.19 --> 2142.65
he doesn't even know anything but he

2140.01 --> 2146.03
will spam his [ __ ] every time he

2142.65 --> 2150.77
pops up and he keeps on doing that and

2146.03 --> 2150.77
yeah that's not somebody I want in here

2152.21 --> 2158.809
that's right it is my show yeah inside

2156.059 --> 2162.15
out baller that's exactly what he is

2158.809 --> 2165.1090000000004
never address is just the absolute

2162.15 --> 2167.609
absence of curvature

2165.109 --> 2170.19
he doesn't address anything he's just

2167.609 --> 2173.04
inserting as a religion well that's not

2170.19 --> 2178.53
the place for this this is not yeah

2173.04 --> 2183.2599999999998
insert your religion show now this is if

2178.53 --> 2187.5
you got an idea then yeah support it and

2183.26 --> 2191.849
if it doesn't work try to make it work

2187.5 --> 2196.049
and if you can't then yeah you can hold

2191.849 --> 2198.98
on to it but yeah I don't want to learn

2196.049 --> 2198.98
I would don't want to know

2210.81 --> 2217.54
and besides if he it's just plain stupid

2215.26 --> 2221.4300000000003
at this point the whole concave earth is

2217.54 --> 2225.88
just dumb the only reason the only

2221.43 --> 2228.04
reason it even exists is because of yet

2225.88 --> 2233.23
another form of physicality assumption

2228.04 --> 2237.61
bias because the realm layout is just

2233.23 --> 2239.7400000000002
not as literal as we want to come cavers

2237.61 --> 2242.13
realize this early on when they saw the

2239.74 --> 2246.16
disk model and say yeah it's not really

2242.13 --> 2248.05
the scale is it right there's still

2246.16 --> 2251.68
these issues that kind of suggest it's

2248.05 --> 2257.1400000000003
sort of globular in some way even though

2251.68 --> 2259.45
there is no curvature so yeah they just

2257.14 --> 2262.48
can't let it go so they just make it an

2259.45 --> 2264.5499999999997
inside-out globe it's not though you

2262.48 --> 2267.43
know hey and if they want some kind of

2264.55 --> 2269.32
come find to be and yeah it's there the

2267.43 --> 2272.3799999999997
earth is definitely within a confined

2269.32 --> 2279.61
it's definitely a realm with spatial

2272.38 --> 2281.92
limits that is it and there is yeah

2279.61 --> 2284.53
nothing physically outside of those

2281.92 --> 2287.01
spatial limits now how far do these

2284.53 --> 2291.7900000000004
spatial limits reach especially

2287.01 --> 2294.3100000000004
laterally or horizontally I don't know

2291.79 --> 2296.68
and there are possibilities and that's

2294.31 --> 2299.22
typically what I talk about but there's

2296.68 --> 2303.25
one certainty there is a limit to it and

2299.22 --> 2307.7799999999997
yeah after after it's figured out how

2303.25 --> 2309.7
all the flat surface segments of the

2307.78 --> 2313.1200000000003
earth interconnect yeah there's all

2309.7 --> 2318.1899999999996
kinds of possibilities and dude if you

2313.12 --> 2321.79
want you can think of it as concave but

2318.19 --> 2325.11
it's not a geometrical literal globe not

2321.79 --> 2328.57
on not on the outside not on the inside

2325.11 --> 2333.76
if you can't get over that geometrical

2328.57 --> 2335.71
fact then you have no place in cosmology

2333.76 --> 2338.28
in actually trying to figure out what

2335.71 --> 2338.28
reality is

2338.39 --> 2347.5899999999997
I like to talk to me in private okay Tom

2344.99 --> 2347.5899999999997
Parker sure

2352.089 --> 2361.859
oh hello Troy cyka cyka glad to see you

2362.489 --> 2366.479
right okay

2376.32 --> 2381.81
okay well glad you enjoyed the show I

2379.44 --> 2387.3
hope you think it's worth your time

2381.81 --> 2394.29
listening this is normally outside of

2387.3 --> 2397.26
your time zone not sure tenth man

2394.29 --> 2399.57
Cooking Channel yeah if you like just

2397.26 --> 2402.48
looking at food and tenth man filming

2399.57 --> 2407.15
and commenting on food while his wife

2402.48 --> 2413.97
and daughter make it yeah enjoy that

2407.15 --> 2419.73
like his his ladies do know how to make

2413.97 --> 2422.5099999999998
some really good meals so yeah great

2419.73 --> 2422.51
good for him man

2425.94 --> 2430.11
[Music]

2427.19 --> 2432.57
no but you hey if you think he's

2430.11 --> 2435.0
actually making it himself then I'd like

2432.57 --> 2437.1600000000003
you to basically watch every video

2435.0 --> 2441.56
segment and see if you can find any

2437.16 --> 2444.5099999999998
evidence actually prove that he is

2441.56 --> 2450.69
cooking that he's actually performing

2444.51 --> 2452.1600000000003
the act other than just showing because

2450.69 --> 2455.16
that's the only thing he ever does he's

2452.16 --> 2458.19
never actually performed a cooking act

2455.16 --> 2460.89
on camera where you can see it's his

2458.19 --> 2464.16
hands know there's people even let his

2460.89 --> 2468.24
wife and his daughter work on it on

2464.16 --> 2471.6299999999997
camera while he films it he doesn't do

2468.24 --> 2476.0699999999997
it though and yeah in an indirect way

2471.63 --> 2479.13
he's kind of conceded this so this is

2476.07 --> 2483.48
like our little mystery and I'm gonna

2479.13 --> 2485.6400000000003
keep trolling about it he's filming it

2483.48 --> 2491.19
oh so now are you are gonna make excuses

2485.64 --> 2494.46
are ya he's filming it this has good

2491.19 --> 2497.43
reason never to do it ever you know he

2494.46 --> 2500.52
can't just put his camera on a tripod or

2497.43 --> 2503.91
ask his wife to maybe hold the camera

2500.52 --> 2507.599
while he's doing something no no no he's

2503.91 --> 2512.759
never ever performed a cooking act on

2507.599 --> 2514.8590000000004
camera in his entire show and I pick up

2512.759 --> 2517.729
on these details and then I make a lot

2514.859 --> 2517.729
of fun about it

2520.23 --> 2523.42
[Music]

2527.41 --> 2530.6099999999997
[Music]

2538.09 --> 2542.17
what I think the dens man is really the

2541.03 --> 2548.86
one singing

2542.17 --> 2550.6800000000003
that's hilarious dank no massage Salim

2548.86 --> 2553.63
he does not and that's the funny thing

2550.68 --> 2558.24
what it is highly suggested throughout

2553.63 --> 2562.3
the entire show it's called tenth man

2558.24 --> 2564.1899999999996
cooking isn't it so I'm pretty sure it

2562.3 --> 2569.3500000000004
doesn't mean that tenth man is getting

2564.19 --> 2573.4
cooked it's pretty suggested that he is

2569.35 --> 2575.86
the person doing the cooking yet there

2573.4 --> 2579.1
is no proof that he is actually doing

2575.86 --> 2582.21
the cooking it's almost like this

2579.1 --> 2590.77
obscure little Grabel in plain sight I

2582.21 --> 2596.8
don't know it's just an innocent little

2590.77 --> 2600.52
gravel just a silly detail but I don't

2596.8 --> 2603.3300000000004
know I does he really not do it I don't

2600.52 --> 2606.0099999999998
know at this moment at this point I

2603.33 --> 2608.38
can't really tell although he's been

2606.01 --> 2611.44
very persistent in responding that he's

2608.38 --> 2613.12
not going to change the format so he

2611.44 --> 2617.41
doesn't really want to prove that he

2613.12 --> 2620.97
actually does any cooking yes yeah so

2617.41 --> 2620.97
think of that what you will

2629.45 --> 2635.24
what are you talking about start a

2631.82 --> 2638.26
hashtag Arwen get him over at Nathan

2635.24 --> 2638.2599999999998
what are you talking about

2655.61 --> 2660.35
I've already widely addressed tenth man

2658.34 --> 2664.9300000000003
not actually doing the cooking on the

2660.35 --> 2667.7
show plenty of it but it's it's a joke

2664.93 --> 2669.83
you know even if it turns out to be

2667.7 --> 2672.2799999999997
accurate it's still got to be a joke

2669.83 --> 2675.91
because technically who really cares

2672.28 --> 2675.9100000000003
it's just silly

2677.92 --> 2682.91
now we cannot insist he show his face

2680.99 --> 2685.4599999999996
you can't make somebody show their face

2682.91 --> 2686.24
you know he might be not showing it for

2685.46 --> 2688.2200000000003
a good reason

2686.24 --> 2690.4399999999996
because he might turn out to be one of

2688.22 --> 2693.62
the most ugly guys you have ever seen

2690.44 --> 2698.62
you know and he just doesn't want to do

2693.62 --> 2698.62
that to his audience you know

2754.9 --> 2756.9300000000003
Oh

2773.36 --> 2779.6600000000003
well I Jam are you talking about me or

2777.95 --> 2782.14
are you talking about tenth man because

2779.66 --> 2786.29
tenth man he does kind of drag me on the

2782.14 --> 2788.45
wall sometimes with this justice it's

2786.29 --> 2791.12
funny interruptions

2788.45 --> 2795.77
sometimes it does get annoying he he

2791.12 --> 2797.99
puns too much but yeah I know sometimes

2795.77 --> 2801.74
he is funny and sometimes it's just ink

2797.99 --> 2804.1699999999996
yeah it so he can be very disruptive but

2801.74 --> 2806.9599999999996
then again we all have our moments like

2804.17 --> 2810.19
chocolate it's been kind of interruptive

2806.96 --> 2814.88
to a couple of shows and last week and

2810.19 --> 2815.27
I've had my moments of course how about

2814.88 --> 2822.2000000000003
me

2815.27 --> 2824.24
all right all right well you know jokes

2822.2 --> 2827.54
with me they just happen I just noticed

2824.24 --> 2829.31
them and if yeah if I got a grip on it I

2827.54 --> 2834.62
put it down and just do it but I don't

2829.31 --> 2841.22
plan jokes I don't dance man he's

2834.62 --> 2846.02
annoying right he doesn't really care

2841.22 --> 2848.18
about that you know tenth man is gonna

2846.02 --> 2850.48
keep on joking as long as he thinks it's

2848.18 --> 2850.48
funny

2866.92 --> 2869.4900000000002
he

2875.23 --> 2880.21
and you can be a pun in yes that's a

2877.91 --> 2880.21
good one

2887.039 --> 2894.42
you must pay a lot of money to be on

2891.16 --> 2897.49
Nate what are you blabbering about

2894.42 --> 2900.4900000000002
that's ridiculous nobody pays Nathan

2897.49 --> 2904.089
money to get on the show it's absolutely

2900.49 --> 2909.7799999999997
absurd no now tenth man is around

2904.089 --> 2912.2799999999997
because he is a relatively reliable

2909.78 --> 2914.38
fallback guy for Nathan because he's

2912.28 --> 2916.78
always there have you seen the free show

2914.38 --> 2919.1800000000003
he's like always there it's just 10th

2916.78 --> 2923.02
man and Nathan usually maybe Paul Hall

2919.18 --> 2926.0789999999997
or someone so yeah Nathan likes him

2923.02 --> 2932.95
because 10th man is can always perform

2926.079 --> 2938.619
filler as it were because he is really

2932.95 --> 2940.72
always there most of the time and he

2938.619 --> 2941.1400000000003
does also yeah he does pair it that's

2940.72 --> 2943.8999999999996
right

2941.14 --> 2947.68
but hey there's a you know a parrot what

2943.9 --> 2954.13
parody the academics the things we have

2947.68 --> 2957.819
figured out and some part you like you

2954.13 --> 2960.1800000000003
like boho the the opinions vary on that

2957.819 --> 2960.18
as well

2963.339 --> 2970.119
I know a certain individual that like

2965.559 --> 2973.779
really has bizarre fantasies about Paul

2970.119 --> 2982.77
Hall getting eaten by baby zombies live

2973.779 --> 2982.77
on air is probably not the only ones

2994.92 --> 3000.17
[Music]

3010.37 --> 3015.38
come on Amanda young technically I

3013.31 --> 3018.08
haven't talked about Nathan I'm talking

3015.38 --> 3021.98
about the people that bad thing these

3018.08 --> 3024.77
are people that I am amidst no color to

3021.98 --> 3027.58
get to know them deal with them find my

3024.77 --> 3027.58
place among them

3033.36 --> 3039.27
but I guess that you've grown like

3036.33 --> 3040.83
really weary of Nathan more and more you

3039.27 --> 3045.15
really don't seem to want to go there

3040.83 --> 3050.33
anymore I take it probably because of

3045.15 --> 3050.33
the shouting I get that

3055.16 --> 3064.19
enough about my friends already you

3058.07 --> 3067.09
wanna hear about me me little me how

3064.19 --> 3067.09
they love me

3077.539 --> 3086.989
and I just go there for the woodshed all

3082.519 --> 3090.2589999999996
right well you know maybe it is also

3086.989 --> 3092.209
kind of like a a psychological war thing

3090.259 --> 3098.239
and maybe that it just appeals to men a

3092.209 --> 3102.169
little more sounds weird maybe but yeah

3098.239 --> 3104.659
we as men I don't even know if this

3102.169 --> 3108.0789999999997
makes any sense to have you but as men

3104.659 --> 3110.659
like we I have this need to basically

3108.079 --> 3114.079
fight for the sanity of my world and

3110.659 --> 3117.109
yeah the ballers are like an Marxists

3114.079 --> 3119.8390000000004
and all of it are almost everyone in

3117.109 --> 3123.799
some way is in direct opposition of that

3119.839 --> 3126.38
and to then sit through a specific

3123.799 --> 3130.779
scenario where that typical opposition

3126.38 --> 3135.649
just gets mangled to bloody pulp is

3130.779 --> 3138.469
almost like a relief that's yeah it's

3135.649 --> 3140.149
like yeah finally they're getting what

3138.469 --> 3142.309
they deserve even though they

3140.149 --> 3144.439
technically probably didn't really

3142.309 --> 3146.8990000000003
deserve it to that extent but then again

3144.439 --> 3154.8689999999997
eventually they will because they do

3146.899 --> 3154.8689999999997
double down on their [ __ ] as well so

3155.229 --> 3160.3089999999997
don't I don't go to knitting because I

3158.119 --> 3163.1890000000003
needed to learn from it you got what you

3160.309 --> 3166.699
needed to learn from Nathan okay okay

3163.189 --> 3169.8089999999997
why if that's enough I get it what the

3166.699 --> 3177.699
thing between Emma and QE now oh god

3169.809 --> 3182.059
yeah it's it's messy it's gonna be messy

3177.699 --> 3185.329
very very messy it seems like it's

3182.059 --> 3187.13
another in-fight issue situation I try

3185.329 --> 3189.739
to enquire I even talked to Emma

3187.13 --> 3192.349
afterward and there's just some weird

3189.739 --> 3195.229
[ __ ] going on I think it's I think it's

3192.349 --> 3200.9190000000003
personal I think it's very very personal

3195.229 --> 3204.9689999999996
and both sides seem to have like really

3200.919 --> 3208.2599999999998
really badly have gone past one another

3204.969 --> 3213.33
but if it doesn't connect

3208.26 --> 3216.63
like it cannot be undone like QE has had

3213.33 --> 3220.59
a certain attitude as he always

3216.63 --> 3223.2000000000003
typically does he yeah he might have

3220.59 --> 3226.4700000000003
been a little bit elbowing at a certain

3223.2 --> 3229.77
point although he dare in a direct sense

3226.47 --> 3237.02
denies that for social tactical reasons

3229.77 --> 3240.03
probably and yeah Emma God like took it

3237.02 --> 3242.4
personal and even took it as a suspicion

3240.03 --> 3244.98
that he might be gatekeeping like he

3242.4 --> 3247.7400000000002
prevented them from engaging when he

3244.98 --> 3250.65
himself later did a video about that

3247.74 --> 3256.5499999999997
subject exactly and that is what am I

3250.65 --> 3256.55
like it really got to her and she's not

3256.58 --> 3263.49
reasonable about it didn't come out

3259.68 --> 3266.3999999999996
right not she she can't see reason about

3263.49 --> 3268.5899999999997
it when explained I try to explain that

3266.4 --> 3271.32
this is how we work and there ya know

3268.59 --> 3273.42
nothing personal but I heard a certain

3271.32 --> 3275.81
type of tremor in a voice in certain

3273.42 --> 3280.08
moments when she was explaining that

3275.81 --> 3283.7999999999997
gave me the feeling like whoa there's

3280.08 --> 3287.52
like a really compressed hidden issue

3283.8 --> 3291.51
there that can never that nobody can

3287.52 --> 3295.47
ever safely extract from her so there is

3291.51 --> 3297.78
a tension between those two I don't

3295.47 --> 3298.2599999999998
think I can fix it I don't think it's

3297.78 --> 3300.1200000000003
possible

3298.26 --> 3302.61
oh by the way Thank You Troy chuka chuka

3300.12 --> 3304.5
for the $5 super chat donation thank you

3302.61 --> 3308.78
very much that's very generous of you

3304.5 --> 3308.78
for a first visit thank you

3311.069 --> 3316.329

3314.47 --> 3321.1899999999996
boundless I have no idea what you're

3316.329 --> 3324.3390000000004
talking about Marceline no idea it

3321.19 --> 3327.579
sounds like a silly rumor to me Tom

3324.339 --> 3329.14
Parker qyz is extremely smart in certain

3327.579 --> 3332.9500000000003
ways he is absolutely

3329.14 --> 3336.49
he is say he has great talent for

3332.95 --> 3341.049
academics he has a really sharp memory

3336.49 --> 3343.799
that's his primary academic skill that's

3341.049 --> 3350.819
counter balanced by his social ineptness

3343.799 --> 3355.119
this is what he knows it yeah

3350.819 --> 3357.579
although at this oh well hello there

3355.119 --> 3361.299

3388.569 --> 3398.079
thank you for becoming a member much

3389.98 --> 3403.119
appreciated that what my last question

3398.079 --> 3408.059
earned you a super jet what's that so

3403.119 --> 3408.059
Salim oh yeah okay

3408.539 --> 3421.2700000000004
about Emma no hmm no QE is not just

3418.029 --> 3424.38
another shouting clown although he can

3421.27 --> 3428.68
be very clownish and he is very shouty

3424.38 --> 3431.049
but that does not point out the limits

3428.68 --> 3434.89
of what he is it just shows a certain

3431.049 --> 3437.02
aspect it's character and yeah that can

3434.89 --> 3439.839
be very annoying to people they may be

3437.02 --> 3442.18
so triggered by that aspect that they

3439.839 --> 3443.849
just step away with me personal it's

3442.18 --> 3447.16
when he starts to sing

3443.849 --> 3449.7000000000003
that's literally when I start to scream

3447.16 --> 3456.549
with my fingers in my ears basically

3449.7 --> 3459.029
it's bad move are we into the states

3456.549 --> 3459.029
really

3465.21 --> 3471.089
okay who knows I have actually

3469.319 --> 3477.569
considered that in the past although at

3471.089 --> 3480.0299999999997
this point it might be unwise but yeah

3477.569 --> 3481.589
if things grow much worse here in the

3480.03 --> 3484.1090000000004
Netherlands and at this point it doesn't

3481.589 --> 3487.5299999999997
really show look like that is going to

3484.109 --> 3489.569
eventually happen but if it will then

3487.53 --> 3492.15
yeah I might move to another country

3489.569 --> 3494.22
although I don't know if if the United

3492.15 --> 3497.19
States would be a wise first choice with

3494.22 --> 3502.1299999999997
that you know maybe I should visit it

3497.19 --> 3502.13
first before I decide to move there and

3502.339 --> 3508.68
we'll see after that you know and if I'm

3504.93 --> 3512.91
gonna be overrun by zombie hordes and

3508.68 --> 3517.6189999999997
attacked by BLM weirdos and looked down

3512.91 --> 3519.839
upon by yeah gun wielding nationalists

3517.619 --> 3523.17
that are just looking at me oh you look

3519.839 --> 3525.7799999999997
you wear weird clothes you have a weird

3523.17 --> 3527.339
accent we don't trust you yeah if that's

3525.78 --> 3530.46
gonna be then I don't think it will by

3527.339 --> 3532.92
the way but yeah I've gotta bump into

3530.46 --> 3534.48
that then I know and that at least

3532.92 --> 3537.2400000000002
doesn't happen here like everybody's

3534.48 --> 3541.14
freaking gay hair and everybody is just

3537.24 --> 3542.6699999999996
morally deranged through the system but

3541.14 --> 3546.089
at least everybody is still kind of

3542.67 --> 3546.799
trying to be nice here for whatever

3546.089 --> 3551.54
that's worth

3546.799 --> 3554.96
so yeah but before I'm gonna move

3551.54 --> 3557.22
anywhere anytime I'm gonna be just

3554.96 --> 3561.17
traveling some places visiting some

3557.22 --> 3561.1699999999996
people first and then we'll see

3569.64 --> 3572.269
yeah

3574.33 --> 3579.22
I have no idea about that dank that's

3577.81 --> 3581.74
the first time I'm hearing of that's

3579.22 --> 3583.93
pretty disgusting I did see a little

3581.74 --> 3589.33
video I don't know if it's the same one

3583.93 --> 3593.95
about a car that was built as a probably

3589.33 --> 3596.38
as a some kind of creepy black up van

3593.95 --> 3599.71
potentially organ extraction or whatever

3596.38 --> 3601.48
I did see that I don't think that's the

3599.71 --> 3604.81
one you're talking about because that

3601.48 --> 3609.58
was a car that was not a container yeah

3604.81 --> 3611.62
but yeah that [ __ ] is dude there are

3609.58 --> 3613.42
some really [ __ ] up Psychopaths out

3611.62 --> 3616.0299999999997
there and they are just building their

3613.42 --> 3617.62
things and they're kind of counting on

3616.03 --> 3620.4700000000003
that people will just overlook it

3617.62 --> 3623.3199999999997
because they can't even approach how

3620.47 --> 3625.99
terrible it might actually be it's thick

3623.32 --> 3628.06
it's the quick move strategy of the

3625.99 --> 3630.1
darkness if you just quickly rush them

3628.06 --> 3632.14
with darkness they'll be shocked and

3630.1 --> 3634.45
just don't know how to respond and then

3632.14 --> 3639.16
you can get away it's a tactic it's a

3634.45 --> 3642.79
darkness tactic it's unbelievably evil

3639.16 --> 3646.99
and in my personal opinion like yeah

3642.79 --> 3649.12
that's people that do that are in my

3646.99 --> 3654.7
personal opinion not really classified

3649.12 --> 3657.7
as human anymore but yeah who cares

3654.7 --> 3660.2799999999997
about my classification of individuals

3657.7 --> 3663.81
out there it is what it is it's [ __ ]

3660.28 --> 3668.4700000000003
up it's disgusting it does happen and

3663.81 --> 3670.66
yeah every time something like that well

3668.47 --> 3671.9199999999996
Wells up gets discovered yeah

3670.66 --> 3673.74
everybody's gonna be like what the [ __ ]

3671.92 --> 3677.19
is this what do you even do with this

3673.74 --> 3677.1899999999996
this knowledge

3683.71 --> 3687.41
so I don't know I don't know in the

3686.72 --> 3692.2099999999996
Netherlands

3687.41 --> 3696.29
if that is real or not or how or I have

3692.21 --> 3700.19
no idea what kind of creepy plans they

3696.29 --> 3702.829
have you know may-maybe it's just

3700.19 --> 3706.01
it could be just purely intimidation

3702.829 --> 3709.2400000000002
tactics that it's like okay they are

3706.01 --> 3711.88
literally trying to well threaten

3709.24 --> 3714.6699999999996
mortally threaten the farmers and [ __ ]

3711.88 --> 3717.619
that are protesting against measurements

3714.67 --> 3720.13
so maybe this is just like oh yeah we're

3717.619 --> 3723.05
gonna show you organ extraction

3720.13 --> 3726.109
execution [ __ ] just show it might even

3723.05 --> 3729.4700000000003
be a prop it might even be faked just to

3726.109 --> 3732.68
show it off to try to push them to

3729.47 --> 3735.5
finally collapse under the pressure by

3732.68 --> 3738.02
just kind of suggesting like yeah we are

3735.5 --> 3738.77
going to [ __ ] execute you just a

3738.02 --> 3741.41
suggestion

3738.77 --> 3743.119
on to these people that are under high

3741.41 --> 3746.27
pressure from the government the so it

3743.119 --> 3749.7200000000003
might literally be a covert Bluff tactic

3746.27 --> 3753.53
at it have you ever considered that just

3749.72 --> 3757.1899999999996
the psychological pressure it could be a

3753.53 --> 3760.2400000000002
prop not real you know unless you are

3757.19 --> 3764.42
finding I don't know pieces of bone or

3760.24 --> 3767.45
skin or blood now that's another matter

3764.42 --> 3769.4900000000002
then you have an actual potential victim

3767.45 --> 3774.16
right well I didn't see that in the

3769.49 --> 3774.16
video it seemed like it was just built

3774.64 --> 3783.339
there was no proof of any actual

3777.29 --> 3783.339
physical activity there so

3794.98 --> 3802.03
finished basement what you want me to

3798.4 --> 3803.89
