[Music]

102.299 --> 105.89
is

104.22 --> 108.479
kind of nice

105.89 --> 110.22
[Music]

108.479 --> 112.799
it's not as clear sky as it was

110.22 --> 116.899
yesterday but

112.799 --> 116.899
there have been some Trails I think

117.78 --> 120.43900000000001
too much

122.52 --> 128.099
Cloud sheep little clouds up there and

125.759 --> 132.3
unless it's kind of like

128.099 --> 134.879
blue but hazy

132.3 --> 136.86
and there's not a lot of wind so with

134.879 --> 139.459
the Sun out it's actually really nice

136.86 --> 139.459
and warm

145.739 --> 149.16
all right

147.03 --> 151.4
[Music]

149.16 --> 151.4
foreign

166.14 --> 171.79999999999998
so hello Cleary first in chat PGC net

172.739 --> 177.31900000000002
what happened to this it was deleted

178.86 --> 185.4
Theory

180.54 --> 187.92
but uh Flat Earth debate and QE shows

185.4 --> 189.3
are gonna continue

187.92 --> 193.159
over

189.3 --> 193.15900000000002
that killed it

193.5 --> 196.76
very similar program

198.659 --> 204.17999999999998
it's probably even better

200.94 --> 207.35999999999999
right so the funny thing was well it

204.18 --> 209.94
isn't funny at all but we basically got

207.36 --> 211.31900000000002
like report attacked and it just got

209.94 --> 213.48
deleted

211.319 --> 216.48
but Betty had apparently already

213.48 --> 216.48
anticipated

216.84 --> 221.94
that they might need to change servers

219.12 --> 223.86
because Discord was just getting a lot

221.94 --> 225.0
of there's like political activity

223.86 --> 228.12
happening

225.0 --> 229.379
behind the scenes there it's terrible

228.12 --> 231.72
so

229.379 --> 235.159
she had already kind of looked into

231.72 --> 235.159
Gillette and

235.2 --> 239.879
yeah that seems to be a an easy quick

238.379 --> 243.12
replacement

239.879 --> 245.76
because of that so thanks to Betty

243.12 --> 248.70000000000002
to her foresight

245.76 --> 254.0
we're able to move on this one or yeah

248.7 --> 254.0
flatter debates is and ball busters

256.62 --> 261.73900000000003
anyway hello at least G good to see you

258.72 --> 261.73900000000003
how are you doing

267.9 --> 271.94
started your new job day all right

272.34 --> 276.38
I was gonna ask about that actually

281.1 --> 284.1
exciting

294.18 --> 299.66
wet here oh so it's still raining over

296.639 --> 299.66
there right

308.97 --> 315.8
[Music]

311.16 --> 315.8
oh it's 23 degrees Celsius here

317.759 --> 322.139
the forecast is it's not going to rain

319.919 --> 326.479
until Friday

322.139 --> 326.479
so just keeps on moving and moving

327.9 --> 330.44
all right

337.95 --> 341.06
[Music]

350.96 --> 357.23999999999995
right so yeah uh called Today's show

355.02 --> 359.75899999999996
running on fumes because I am kind of

357.24 --> 362.639
running on fumes

359.759 --> 366.02000000000004
I did not have

362.639 --> 366.02
proper dinner yesterday

366.24 --> 374.479
and today I will only thanks to yeah the

370.74 --> 374.479
the donations from yesterday

374.639 --> 380.479
but uh yeah I am really kind of stressed

377.699 --> 380.479
out at the moment

383.759 --> 390.12
not gonna be smoking anything

387.06 --> 392.699
except for the tobacco I got left

390.12 --> 396.86
and uh

392.699 --> 396.86
yeah in the same time

396.9 --> 403.73999999999995
is this new infighting wave and I find

400.86 --> 407.40000000000003
it extremely unpleasant

403.74 --> 410.039
I mean I might even dig into it a bit if

407.4 --> 412.25899999999996
I if I wouldn't be so freaking stressed

410.039 --> 416.0
out and running on fumes

412.259 --> 416.0
but it's just too tiresome

427.259 --> 434.039
right so yeah I'm gonna have to

430.62 --> 436.319
basically ins yeah introduce a policy

434.039 --> 438.479
emergency

436.319 --> 443.06
if I don't get a donation

438.479 --> 443.06
on the show I'm not doing the next show

443.699 --> 446.84000000000003
I can't do it

447.479 --> 452.3
like I'm already in debt I mean

452.9 --> 458.4
there's literally nowhere left for me to

456.18 --> 460.98
pull money from

458.4 --> 464.09999999999997
right now

460.98 --> 464.1
[Music]

467.41 --> 470.53900000000004
[Music]

470.599 --> 476.46
and yeah

473.52 --> 477.599
if the situation does not improve I will

476.46 --> 481.4
have to quit

477.599 --> 481.4
I have no choice

482.039 --> 487.139
because I can't do this

484.8 --> 488.46000000000004
if I'm stressed out about money and

487.139 --> 490.319
hungry

488.46 --> 493.79999999999995
a lot

490.319 --> 496.5
I mean like a day and a month or

493.8 --> 500.16
something that's one thing I'm kind of

496.5 --> 501.82
used to that but if it's gonna just be

500.16 --> 505.139
continual

501.82 --> 509.34
[Music]

505.139 --> 512.82
then I have to basically scramble

509.34 --> 516.4399999999999
to get out there and try to figure out

512.82 --> 516.44
some kind of new career because

521.82 --> 528.12
right because the as they said yeah it

525.899 --> 530.22
feels like the river's running dry

528.12 --> 533.82
not even with inspiration or anything

530.22 --> 537.839
and I think that you guys

533.82 --> 540.5400000000001
have learned a lot and I do appreciate

537.839 --> 542.7600000000001
you and the contributions

540.54 --> 545.2199999999999
because I know that you care and that

542.76 --> 547.3199999999999
you with the little bits even when you

545.22 --> 548.4590000000001
don't have it almost you'll still do

547.32 --> 550.32
that

548.459 --> 554.18
and

550.32 --> 554.1800000000001
I do my best to

555.36 --> 558.6800000000001
accommodate for it

559.32 --> 561.9200000000001
but

566.519 --> 571.44
right so either I just have to

568.92 --> 576.019
completely rearrange the format and

571.44 --> 576.019
somehow get more popularity

576.66 --> 582.7199999999999
and that way just get a bit more income

580.68 --> 585.7199999999999
but

582.72 --> 587.76
it's like really

585.72 --> 590.519
it brings a lot of internal friction

587.76 --> 594.06
because I feel that I'm doing a good

590.519 --> 596.339
thing at least when I'm just in the flow

594.06 --> 598.26
when I'm not stressed out because the

596.339 --> 602.1
stressed out parts do kind of take away

598.26 --> 604.88
from the quality overall

602.1 --> 604.88
perhaps

604.98 --> 609.019
or maybe you find it really interesting

610.1 --> 612.5
foreign

611.38 --> 616.88
[Music]

612.5 --> 616.88
I'm just kind of stressed out right now

624.48 --> 631.64
but we can discuss

628.44 --> 631.6400000000001
whatever you guys like

633.24 --> 638.94
I wonder if Tera 306 is going to come

635.519 --> 642.2
back I did unban him but

638.94 --> 642.2
maybe he just

642.42 --> 645.7199999999999
yeah

643.56 --> 648.0
I don't know

645.72 --> 651.62
I mean those types of situations like

648.0 --> 651.62
yesterday it doesn't make me very happy

660.24 --> 667.22
anyway sorry if I bring you down

663.839 --> 667.22
did not intend to

670.019 --> 674.519
thank God I got the inner food I mean

672.36 --> 677.88
without that stuff I feel like

674.519 --> 680.48
incredibly bad right now

677.88 --> 680.48
right

683.29 --> 686.429
[Music]

695.3 --> 699.54
so anyhow just want to inform you guys

698.399 --> 703.8
that

699.54 --> 706.079
flatters debate is basically fooling in

703.8 --> 710.06
I mean the chat has just not been

706.079 --> 710.06
stopping in in Skype

710.94 --> 718.3800000000001
especially concerning

713.42 --> 721.68
jiren's video which was so ridiculous

718.38 --> 726.26
and embarrassing really from a technical

721.68 --> 726.26
perspective that it's just crazy

727.68 --> 731.3
and I'm not happy about that

735.24 --> 741.67
because I don't want like jiren to fall

738.0 --> 742.92
I think he's been incredibly valuable

741.67 --> 745.92
[Music]

742.92 --> 747.959
in the Flat Earth Community just for

745.92 --> 750.959
learning purposes he makes pretty good

747.959 --> 754.1999999999999
videos especially the ones about

750.959 --> 755.5999999999999
space it's been very good I don't want

754.2 --> 758.909
him to crumble

755.6 --> 758.909
[Music]

763.32 --> 770.639
you know I met Jaren in 2019

767.16 --> 773.459
and I've immediately recognize that he

770.639 --> 776.5790000000001
has issues but

773.459 --> 779.1199999999999
he just like

776.579 --> 779.12
uh

789.5 --> 793.519
he's a large following yes

795.0 --> 799.04
or he's put a lot of work into it

801.48 --> 806.4590000000001
and he's like a first waiver so he's

804.24 --> 809.4590000000001
been around like forever

806.459 --> 809.459
foreign

814.57 --> 817.889
[Music]

828.74 --> 834.1800000000001
but yeah I don't know

831.899 --> 837.0
I have no problem with jiren having a

834.18 --> 838.56
big following I mean I'd like a bigger

837.0 --> 841.68
following too

838.56 --> 844.4399999999999
even if just for more chat activity that

841.68 --> 846.54
isn't just disgusting trolls trying to

844.44 --> 847.98
demoralize me

846.54 --> 851.899
right

847.98 --> 851.899
because I get already plenty of that

851.94 --> 856.2600000000001
but I don't really know even what's

855.06 --> 857.5189999999999
stopping people

856.26 --> 860.519
[Music]

857.519 --> 863.82
hey Susie s

860.519 --> 865.44
I mean I am widely known I get mentions

863.82 --> 868.8000000000001
everywhere

865.44 --> 871.019
and even if you get like bad mentions by

868.8 --> 873.3599999999999
big channels there's gonna be plenty of

871.019 --> 874.93
people checking it out

873.36 --> 881.86
so

874.93 --> 881.8599999999999
[Music]

894.65 --> 897.77
[Music]

904.699 --> 909.42
but yeah there's a lot of things that

907.199 --> 911.04
jiren talks about that I absolutely do

909.42 --> 914.2199999999999
not like

911.04 --> 916.139
I think it his biblical perspective is

914.22 --> 918.5400000000001
kind of ridiculous and strong Manny

916.139 --> 920.399
although there is plenty wrong with it

918.54 --> 923.7199999999999
so I agree with that it's just the way

920.399 --> 923.72
he does it I don't like that

924.959 --> 927.7399999999999
and

930.54 --> 936.36
yeah and now like he's literally just

934.26 --> 939.86
attacked the scientific method

936.36 --> 939.86
said it doesn't prove anything

943.74 --> 950.399
and it's not like he retracted or made

946.38 --> 953.76
it like an after video like yeah maybe I

950.399 --> 957.68
I went a little overboard no no no this

953.76 --> 957.68
is like they're all proud of it

958.74 --> 963.66
like the guys of red glow Busters

961.92 --> 967.86
so

963.66 --> 969.36
it's just it just feels like tragedy all

967.86 --> 971.16
of it

969.36 --> 976.22
to me

971.16 --> 976.2199999999999
sorry for being a a bummer like that

981.899 --> 986.36
and then she noticed at guests on the

984.18 --> 986.3599999999999
show

986.639 --> 993.779
I wouldn't do that well I could it's

989.579 --> 996.12
just that Skype has been really sucky

993.779 --> 998.1
doing that

996.12 --> 1001.579
it's just not

998.1 --> 1004.399
working great sound always sound issues

1001.579 --> 1006.3199999999999
always but sure

1004.399 --> 1008.18
I'd have guessed some

1006.32 --> 1010.5400000000001
at this point I mean if that's gonna

1008.18 --> 1010.54
help

1012.279 --> 1019.8389999999999
as long as it's not like anti-flat

1015.8 --> 1019.8389999999999
earthers because I'm not gonna do it

1020.06 --> 1025.52
and I don't want to have like I don't

1022.94 --> 1028.88
know wits it over or something

1025.52 --> 1031.04
or Bev just because it's gonna become

1028.88 --> 1033.919
complaining about Flat Earth debate and

1031.04 --> 1035.78
they're gonna literally on air try to

1033.919 --> 1037.64
tell me maybe you shouldn't be

1035.78 --> 1039.62
associating with them anymore because

1037.64 --> 1042.2800000000002
that shit's been happening for like

1039.62 --> 1042.28
three years

1042.5 --> 1046.54
so I I don't

1046.699 --> 1051.44
need guests like that

1049.04 --> 1054.08
if somebody else who just wants to pop

1051.44 --> 1057.64
up and just have a conversation or share

1054.08 --> 1057.6399999999999
some information yeah sure

1061.64 --> 1066.0200000000002
or look if it's like Babs wants to come

1064.76 --> 1068.81
on

1066.02 --> 1071.059
and just have a talk and not

1068.81 --> 1072.1399999999999
[Music]

1071.059 --> 1075.2
get

1072.14 --> 1075.2
to debatey

1075.26 --> 1080.02
I do it as well

1077.539 --> 1080.02
fine

1080.84 --> 1085.1299999999999
[Music]

1093.559 --> 1098.1789999999999
right so hey do any of you want to try

1096.2 --> 1100.4
coming on with me

1098.179 --> 1102.8600000000001
I mean I could try it

1100.4 --> 1105.2
you could just call me on Skype

1102.86 --> 1107.299
and I'll just take the call

1105.2 --> 1109.78
and we'll see what happens sound wise

1107.299 --> 1109.78
and all that

1117.16 --> 1120.269
[Music]

1144.679 --> 1149.48
foreign

1146.86 --> 1151.6399999999999
by the way there's some interesting

1149.48 --> 1155.26
things happening in the Netherlands also

1151.64 --> 1155.26
it's still kind of in the background

1155.66 --> 1164.72
but there is like a a legal case rolling

1161.419 --> 1166.8200000000002
against like the yeah the prime figures

1164.72 --> 1168.14
in their government for their criminal

1166.82 --> 1171.02
actions

1168.14 --> 1174.38
on a variety of situations

1171.02 --> 1176.66
and like they're basically just

1174.38 --> 1180.88
obstructing

1176.66 --> 1180.88
Justice and doing weird things

1181.34 --> 1184.76
and

1182.9 --> 1186.919
well since the one who wrote this

1184.76 --> 1189.799
article mentioned that yeah there was

1186.919 --> 1193.039
somebody else in the Netherlands in 1946

1189.799 --> 1195.2
that it did exactly the same things

1193.039 --> 1199.84
and he was actually

1195.2 --> 1199.8400000000001
like executed for that

1199.94 --> 1202.8400000000001
so

1203.539 --> 1207.58
things are getting very serious I think

1213.74 --> 1220.179
I forgot to go out shortly all right

1216.74 --> 1220.179
you have an umbrella

1221.419 --> 1224.14
umbrella could help

1229.0 --> 1236.299
I mean when it's like kind of rainy I

1233.12 --> 1237.9799999999998
always take my umbrella even on my bike

1236.299 --> 1241.34
because yeah

1237.98 --> 1243.559
it's not that much in the way but if it

1241.34 --> 1247.059
starts raining then at least I'm not

1243.559 --> 1247.059
gonna get completely soaked

1252.919 --> 1257.679
yeah I know Susie ass

1259.34 --> 1264.1599999999999
it's just there's so much tension from

1261.799 --> 1269.26
so many sides

1264.16 --> 1269.26
it's not making me feel great

1270.87 --> 1273.9599999999998
[Music]

1279.62 --> 1282.4599999999998
I mean

1291.559 --> 1296.8999999999999
yeah oh I've been having weird dreams

1294.5 --> 1301.24
too not pleasant ones

1296.9 --> 1301.24
not nightmares but just weird

1308.78 --> 1314.86
if you want to

1310.82 --> 1314.86
I don't think he wants to talk to me

1317.539 --> 1323.3799999999999
I mean I went full at him in chat

1321.26 --> 1325.8799999999999
was it the on Friday

1323.38 --> 1329.419
[Music]

1325.88 --> 1332.419
and yeah I mean

1329.419 --> 1334.46
I I don't really want to talk to him I

1332.419 --> 1336.7
think that he's acting like really

1334.46 --> 1339.8600000000001
disgusting and is basically

1336.7 --> 1343.1200000000001
violating the sanctity of his own skills

1339.86 --> 1343.12
doing all this

1350.36 --> 1354.559
and I'm not going to be able to talk him

1352.159 --> 1358.6000000000001
out of it I mean he's already done it

1354.559 --> 1358.6
so he's not gonna stop

1359.24 --> 1366.34
I don't think he's gonna even just walk

1360.98 --> 1366.34
away and like why would he just yeah

1366.88 --> 1372.8200000000002
I think he's probably gonna end up

1369.32 --> 1372.82
burning himself out with this

1384.919 --> 1388.9
if I don't burn out first

1395.34 --> 1398.52
[Music]

1400.34 --> 1405.6789999999999
well hey sure if you guys say oh you're

1402.679 --> 1408.2
gonna do that you're gonna do that Arwin

1405.679 --> 1410.6000000000001
sure I'll do it I'll [ __ ] do it man

1408.2 --> 1413.059
I'll I'll have an apologetic

1410.6 --> 1414.1999999999998
conversation with Bob no Dell himself

1413.059 --> 1416.96
okay

1414.2 --> 1418.4
and I apologize for everything bad that

1416.96 --> 1420.559
I've ever said about him even though

1418.4 --> 1421.76
it's all based on the real things that

1420.559 --> 1425.12
happened

1421.76 --> 1427.52
I'll do all that yeah you got me guys

1425.12 --> 1429.9799999999998
you got me through the money you got

1427.52 --> 1432.799
more money aren't you proud

1429.98 --> 1436.1
good old Arwen couldn't hold his tongue

1432.799 --> 1438.44
couldn't just carry those beans without

1436.1 --> 1440.1789999999999
spilling it

1438.44 --> 1443.14
so now

1440.179 --> 1446.14
Arwin gets exactly what he deserves

1443.14 --> 1448.94
starvation and poverty

1446.14 --> 1451.46
everybody's happy

1448.94 --> 1454.78
shouldn't talk like that I just feel

1451.46 --> 1454.78
really [ __ ] miserable

1462.86 --> 1467.559
I know where Whitsett got his stuff

1465.02 --> 1467.559
Clary

1469.22 --> 1476.1200000000001
I know he got that from Ken wheeler

1472.64 --> 1479.48
but it's all a giant straw man

1476.12 --> 1480.86
nothing about it is anything beyond

1479.48 --> 1483.74
philosophical

1480.86 --> 1486.6789999999999
I mean changing your model of what you

1483.74 --> 1489.26
think things are doesn't change the

1486.679 --> 1491.3600000000001
experiment results

1489.26 --> 1494.9
it doesn't matter what you call it

1491.36 --> 1497.86
whether you call it an atom or a wave or

1494.9 --> 1499.8200000000002
a manifested

1497.86 --> 1501.62
non-manifestation whatever the [ __ ]

1499.82 --> 1504.5
you're gonna call it it is what it is

1501.62 --> 1508.82
it's only a model it's not relevant

1504.5 --> 1511.94
it's not relevant to the actual physics

1508.82 --> 1516.02
so his entire argumentation based on Ken

1511.94 --> 1519.38
Wheeler's is just one giant straw man

1516.02 --> 1521.6
it's almost not a straw man it's just a

1519.38 --> 1524.2600000000002
very distracting story that doesn't add

1521.6 --> 1524.26
up to anything

1532.78 --> 1535.839
[Music]

1537.679 --> 1541.419
hmm okay if you just seen it

1549.5 --> 1556.1
yeah I mean the official story of 9 11

1553.52 --> 1556.8799999999999
is so ridiculous I don't even find it

1556.1 --> 1559.9599999999998
worth

1556.88 --> 1559.96
discussing anymore

1562.34 --> 1568.52
I didn't watch like a video on

1567.32 --> 1571.52
um

1568.52 --> 1571.52
freevoice.io

1571.82 --> 1578.6
from Mad Quantum of conscious about 911

1574.539 --> 1580.46
like a pretty much a mood piece

1578.6 --> 1582.62
really

1580.46 --> 1585.8600000000001
yeah that

1582.62 --> 1589.2199999999998
really with your nose right on to it

1585.86 --> 1593.32
I mean the whole thing is so bizarre

1589.22 --> 1593.32
and also that freaking sound

1594.919 --> 1599.48
so weird

1597.08 --> 1603.02
I mean where's that coming from that's

1599.48 --> 1604.88
not like a Electro box that's like oh

1603.02 --> 1606.5
there's some short circuit happening

1604.88 --> 1610.1000000000001
right

1606.5 --> 1612.919
no was super loud I mean that must have

1610.1 --> 1616.58
been sound

1612.919 --> 1620.0
like oh yeah and the hell half molten

1616.58 --> 1622.46
cars are just exactly half of it is

1620.0 --> 1625.46
completely like torched and the other

1622.46 --> 1629.74
half is completely clean including the

1625.46 --> 1629.74
gas tank that type of freaky [ __ ]

1630.44 --> 1634.779
so yeah the footage he showed definitely

1635.38 --> 1640.419
emphasized to me that

1638.0 --> 1644.72
there's just a likelihood that there is

1640.419 --> 1648.8600000000001
electromagnetic like the Tesla weapon

1644.72 --> 1651.919
to justify it like where did it all go

1648.86 --> 1653.8999999999999
just like there should be a huge pile of

1651.919 --> 1658.0
rubble there that like a hundred meters

1653.9 --> 1658.0
tall or something there was nothing

1659.059 --> 1664.94
it was just almost all gone

1662.799 --> 1666.44
totally disintegrated

1664.94 --> 1668.98
[Music]

1666.44 --> 1668.98
so

1676.279 --> 1681.46
I think that Owen bench May really be on

1679.039 --> 1681.46
to something

1682.24 --> 1689.0
with Trump using that Tesla attack to do

1687.799 --> 1692.74
that

1689.0 --> 1692.74
to be part of that setup

1694.94 --> 1698.089
[Music]

1702.38 --> 1706.72
yeah that that too PGC net

1712.7 --> 1715.539
ah

1733.159 --> 1736.5390000000002
right so yeah

1753.46 --> 1759.8600000000001
by the way uh

1757.52 --> 1762.1399999999999
like a guy from

1759.86 --> 1764.7199999999998
our local government here might be

1762.14 --> 1765.98
watching my show right now I don't know

1764.72 --> 1767.8990000000001
if he is

1765.98 --> 1770.24
but he was actually really eager to

1767.899 --> 1773.26
check out my channel and he had my name

1770.24 --> 1773.26
wrong the first time

1773.899 --> 1779.7199999999998
but he's checking it out I

1777.02 --> 1781.279
we'll see

1779.72 --> 1783.679
I wonder if he's going to give me some

1781.279 --> 1786.22
feedback

1783.679 --> 1790.46
I mean he's bound to be

1786.22 --> 1792.799
interacting with other people too that

1790.46 --> 1794.6000000000001
probably also live on social welfare and

1792.799 --> 1798.62
that are trying to like stream on top of

1794.6 --> 1800.9599999999998
that so maybe I could get some valuable

1798.62 --> 1803.7199999999998
analytical data from him

1800.96 --> 1806.0
I really hope so

1803.72 --> 1808.82
because I don't really know how well I'm

1806.0 --> 1811.039
doing compared to others other than

1808.82 --> 1816.46
a lot of other streamers

1811.039 --> 1816.46
I'm just it's just really [ __ ] boring

1818.899 --> 1823.82
I don't want to be mean but for example

1821.419 --> 1826.8200000000002
I checked out Bev's hangout yesterday

1823.82 --> 1828.86
which lasted like freaking six hours

1826.82 --> 1831.98
like what the [ __ ]

1828.86 --> 1835.52
what the [ __ ] man way too long

1831.98 --> 1839.059
and it was just

1835.52 --> 1841.399
it was like 24 7 flattered Discord it

1839.059 --> 1842.96
was just guys hanging talking and then

1841.399 --> 1845.779
it turned out that Blue Marble science

1842.96 --> 1848.3600000000001
was on there but I didn't even recognize

1845.779 --> 1850.399
it that he was on there I didn't even

1848.36 --> 1856.039
recognize him there

1850.399 --> 1856.039
because it was just so freaking boring

1856.24 --> 1865.34
boring oh my God I'm sorry I don't want

1861.26 --> 1868.1
that to be what it is but it is

1865.34 --> 1869.4189999999999
well nothing's happening no guidance no

1868.1 --> 1871.2199999999998
rules

1869.419 --> 1873.14
everybody's just

1871.22 --> 1875.48
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

1873.14 --> 1877.7
whatever they want in every any

1875.48 --> 1880.48
Direction they want

1877.7 --> 1880.48
and

1882.08 --> 1886.76
when I zoom tune tune in a couple of

1884.539 --> 1889.58
times it was like discussing again about

1886.76 --> 1890.84
oh The Horizon is not in the right place

1889.58 --> 1893.1789999999999
and I mean

1890.84 --> 1895.1589999999999
is that the reason is that the reason

1893.179 --> 1897.98
why you say there's something wrong with

1895.159 --> 1900.7990000000002
the Black Swan argument because you want

1897.98 --> 1904.64
the Ballers to be able to blabber on for

1900.799 --> 1908.32
hours and hours about nonsense

1904.64 --> 1908.3200000000002
is that the reason Bev

1909.08 --> 1912.8799999999999
so yeah I'm not doing that again

1914.96 --> 1919.3400000000001
I mean

1916.94 --> 1921.38
sometimes I think that my shows can be a

1919.34 --> 1923.539
bit boring it's just me here on camera

1921.38 --> 1926.659
for like two hours

1923.539 --> 1930.919
but holy [ __ ]

1926.659 --> 1933.2
I'm not that boring apparently

1930.919 --> 1935.8400000000001
maybe it's because it can be loud and

1933.2 --> 1938.539
very emotioned

1935.84 --> 1941.36
in my expression and all that

1938.539 --> 1944.48
they don't seem to be doing that at all

1941.36 --> 1947.12
it's just boring I'm sorry sorry Beth

1944.48 --> 1948.559
it's boring I can't I can't be part of

1947.12 --> 1951.82
that

1948.559 --> 1951.82
it's just nothing happening

1958.85 --> 1962.05
[Music]

1966.32 --> 1973.1589999999999
20 let it right yeah but to be fair pjc

1970.22 --> 1975.52
net I mean it is literally a 24 7

1973.159 --> 1975.5200000000002
Channel

1976.76 --> 1983.48
so you'd expect that to kind of get

1980.659 --> 1986.1200000000001
sporadic and boring and Silent at times

1983.48 --> 1987.8600000000001
I mean that's logical it's a 24 7

1986.12 --> 1989.899
Channel

1987.86 --> 1994.279
it's always live

1989.899 --> 1997.039
it's a miracle that they even have

1994.279 --> 2000.159
daily content really

1997.039 --> 2003.6
but yeah bab does not have that

2000.159 --> 2003.6000000000001
so he has no excuse

2009.59 --> 2015.72
[Music]

2011.919 --> 2015.72
hello flatter Sage by the way

2023.08 --> 2027.1
oh hello dala notice that the sign

2025.419 --> 2029.14
pseudoscience server is missing yeah

2027.1 --> 2031.6589999999999
it's deleted

2029.14 --> 2036.1200000000001
the crew has moved on

2064.48 --> 2066.599
okay

2068.46 --> 2072.429
[Music]

2073.119 --> 2080.44
right so I went to bed pretty early

2075.099 --> 2080.44
yesterday which is good enough average

2080.74 --> 2084.9599999999996
not too late but yeah just

2085.24 --> 2090.58
because hunger

2087.899 --> 2093.54
I mean hunger does not make it Pleasant

2090.58 --> 2093.54
to stay up very late

2093.879 --> 2096.8199999999997
but at least I'll have dinner proper

2096.04 --> 2100.2
dinner

2096.82 --> 2100.2000000000003
this evening so

2102.82 --> 2108.46
I still got my inner food

2105.88 --> 2109.96
you had some dreams

2108.46 --> 2112.9
yes

2109.96 --> 2115.859
weird dreams

2112.9 --> 2115.859
kind of gross

2118.0 --> 2122.68
I think it's probably a reflection of my

2120.7 --> 2124.72
desperation

2122.68 --> 2127.06
because sometimes when I get really

2124.72 --> 2129.52
desperate then the things that I dream

2127.06 --> 2132.7599999999998
it's like all the people in there

2129.52 --> 2136.839
suddenly turn into

2132.76 --> 2138.88
ugly and like super insecure people

2136.839 --> 2142.72
it's really weird how that works it's

2138.88 --> 2144.82
not identifiable people by the way so

2142.72 --> 2146.7999999999997
like Conjuring

2144.82 --> 2148.78
but normally when I dream it's like

2146.8 --> 2152.7400000000002
everybody when I feel great everybody

2148.78 --> 2155.32
looks great and beautiful and attractive

2152.74 --> 2157.8999999999996
that's I don't even like interact with

2155.32 --> 2160.3590000000004
people that much but it's like that but

2157.9 --> 2163.98
yeah yesterday it was like

2160.359 --> 2163.98
completely the opposite

2170.8 --> 2173.8
foreign

2181.18 --> 2186.54
at least I was able to actually notice

2183.94 --> 2186.54
in the dream

2189.82 --> 2194.92
right but I think that the the dream was

2192.22 --> 2197.3199999999997
basically trying to express to me the

2194.92 --> 2199.66
nature of desperation and that hey if

2197.32 --> 2203.76
you get desperate enough anything is is

2199.66 --> 2203.7599999999998
good anything like even

2204.579 --> 2210.1800000000003
ugly and stupid people

2207.82 --> 2213.1800000000003
which is like really

2210.18 --> 2216.339
counter-intuitive to me

2213.18 --> 2218.6189999999997
although yeah in the dream like if real

2216.339 --> 2222.4
ugly people are not always like that

2218.619 --> 2224.98
it's so complicated how that it's the

2222.4 --> 2226.54
spirit and then there's the body and the

2224.98 --> 2231.7
talents

2226.54 --> 2231.7
and somebody can be like really just

2233.74 --> 2239.2599999999998
be Fantastical even though they seem

2236.32 --> 2242.579
like they're like decrepit it's weird

2239.26 --> 2242.579
it's unpredictable

2243.81 --> 2246.94
[Music]

2256.14 --> 2260.8199999999997
it's a reflection on how you're feeling

2258.46 --> 2260.82
yeah

2269.5 --> 2274.54
all right but yeah I mean those types of

2271.9 --> 2275.619
Dreams in ways are better than when I

2274.54 --> 2279.099
feel like

2275.619 --> 2281.38
I have weird angry dreams too

2279.099 --> 2284.5
where I feel like the rage win type

2281.38 --> 2287.1400000000003
feelings but not like really active it's

2284.5 --> 2289.96
just it's doorman but it does set the

2287.14 --> 2291.94
tone and I've had like dreams where it's

2289.96 --> 2294.64
so [ __ ] up that

2291.94 --> 2298.68
just people in my dreams come up to me

2294.64 --> 2298.68
and ask me if I could please kill them

2299.32 --> 2304.98
and they like stalk me

2301.54 --> 2304.98
to do that it's

2308.32 --> 2311.6400000000003
very unnerving

2319.18 --> 2324.22
yeah it is it is kind of scary also

2322.359 --> 2327.64
because

2324.22 --> 2330.52
they actually wanted to get me in

2327.64 --> 2333.1189999999997
trouble like they literally

2330.52 --> 2333.119
like

2333.339 --> 2340.2599999999998
try to make me kill them to get me in

2337.24 --> 2340.2599999999998
trouble but

2340.78 --> 2343.26
yeah

2343.54 --> 2347.5
safe to say I don't typically like

2345.88 --> 2350.88
talking about those dreams because

2347.5 --> 2350.88
they're really [ __ ] up

2357.3 --> 2362.8590000000004
right but maybe that's an expression of

2359.92 --> 2365.02
some how some of these trolls just sound

2362.859 --> 2366.64
I really feel sometimes like they they

2365.02 --> 2369.04
really just want to be put out of their

2366.64 --> 2372.0989999999997
misery and they don't know how to do it

2369.04 --> 2374.859
and then they see

2372.099 --> 2376.54
how relatively unrestrained I am and

2374.859 --> 2380.44
it's almost like oh could you please

2376.54 --> 2382.72
release me from this nightmare

2380.44 --> 2384.4
and it's not like I haven't played into

2382.72 --> 2388.6189999999997
that

2384.4 --> 2388.619
verbally on my show because I have

2390.22 --> 2394.839
but yeah

2392.04 --> 2397.619
sometimes it comes back as dreams not

2394.839 --> 2397.619
very pleasant

2398.579 --> 2403.5
but that doesn't happen regularly so

2406.27 --> 2409.32
[Music]

2413.0 --> 2420.0
[Music]

2416.26 --> 2420.0
oh man it's kind of warm here

2420.22 --> 2422.7
thank you

2429.18 --> 2434.98
it is literally warm I don't know why

2432.099 --> 2437.579
I'm surprised that I'm feeling warm it

2434.98 --> 2440.5
is warm and I got two t-shirts on

2437.579 --> 2442.599
but yeah this this will be with the door

2440.5 --> 2444.839
open it'll work out better nobody's home

2442.599 --> 2444.839
anyway

2459.16 --> 2462.16
foreign

2467.32 --> 2471.0
right so yeah dreams

2471.46 --> 2474.9
dreams dreams dreams

2493.78 --> 2499.0
I'm wondering sometimes if there would

2495.82 --> 2501.7000000000003
be like radio shows out there that would

2499.0 --> 2503.26
actually have me

2501.7 --> 2505.359
I mean

2503.26 --> 2508.6600000000003
as long as I don't have to be some kind

2505.359 --> 2510.94
of CNN news reader that just

2508.66 --> 2512.92
only manipulates with terrible things

2510.94 --> 2514.839
and so sphere porn

2512.92 --> 2518.079
that'll be great

2514.839 --> 2520.599
especially if I can basically unleash a

2518.079 --> 2522.1800000000003
bit of Armenian Insight some things if

2520.599 --> 2527.02
they allow me to do that

2522.18 --> 2528.94
but just fantasizing I guess

2527.02 --> 2531.52
in our day out there

2528.94 --> 2533.44
I mean I can't do this sort of thing in

2531.52 --> 2535.24
Dutch as well I've been doing it in

2533.44 --> 2537.9
English forever but I can't do it in

2535.24 --> 2537.8999999999996
Dutch as well

2538.0 --> 2543.72
I mean they want English or if there

2540.7 --> 2543.72
even is a day

2553.48 --> 2557.82
but it's probably more likely that

2559.96 --> 2563.32
I don't know I don't know what I'm

2561.76 --> 2566.32
saying

2563.32 --> 2566.32
uh

2568.92 --> 2573.7200000000003
hey Jeff gashead good to see you

2579.76 --> 2584.3190000000004
I'm glad that still plenty of you are

2582.04 --> 2587.92
left here

2584.319 --> 2589.9
because some people have actually left

2587.92 --> 2592.48
I think

2589.9 --> 2595.38
because of the ether Wars

2592.48 --> 2595.38
I think they left

2605.8 --> 2610.3
you didn't leave okay good to hear that

2608.02 --> 2613.24
that flat fellow I haven't seen you in a

2610.3 --> 2616.119
while though but good to see you

2613.24 --> 2618.3999999999996
hmm

2616.119 --> 2620.48
all right I'm gonna take a bite of this

2622.119 --> 2625.079
solid in me

2625.78 --> 2629.8590000000004
29 viewing seems average no that but

2628.24 --> 2633.4199999999996
that's not what I mean I mean people

2629.859 --> 2633.42
that actually get in the chat

2646.599 --> 2649.5
foreign

2667.14 --> 2670.2599999999998
by the way

2670.599 --> 2675.1600000000003
and Godzilla

2673.54 --> 2680.099
good to see you

2675.16 --> 2680.0989999999997
hmm actually kind of a nice full chat

2681.28 --> 2687.01
[Music]

2695.26 --> 2702.4
so again I'd like to emphasize that

2698.92 --> 2704.819
Running on Fumes financially in nerve

2702.4 --> 2704.819
wise

2706.06 --> 2710.52
I'm gonna have to get some donations

2708.04 --> 2710.52
today

2710.98 --> 2717.94
and tomorrow and the day after and

2715.079 --> 2719.98
if I don't then there will not be a show

2717.94 --> 2721.94
the next day

2719.98 --> 2726.0190000000002
I have to do it

2721.94 --> 2726.0190000000002
[Music]

2730.5 --> 2736.42
now somebody for some reason starts to

2733.72 --> 2738.8999999999996
pile on then that kind of changes the

2736.42 --> 2738.9
situation

2739.119 --> 2744.2200000000003
and it could basically take that as like

2741.28 --> 2745.599
oh wow do that much well that's gonna

2744.22 --> 2748.18
give me

2745.599 --> 2750.7200000000003
like half a week

2748.18 --> 2750.72
right

2750.76 --> 2756.1600000000003
so yeah don't hold back if you were

2753.7 --> 2758.9199999999996
planning to donate to me

2756.16 --> 2760.41
but uh yeah

2758.92 --> 2764.17
it's kind of tight

2760.41 --> 2764.17
[Music]

2769.3 --> 2774.88
of course I am open for questions

2773.5 --> 2778.0
you want me to address something

2774.88 --> 2781.2000000000003
something specific

2778.0 --> 2781.2
let me know

2788.92 --> 2792.96
okay there was still somebody home

2800.45 --> 2803.58

2921.22 --> 2926.22
explain

how do you see that

2928.0 --> 2934.319
how desperate the trolls really are

2931.66 --> 2934.319
why

2962.02 --> 2965.56
are you saying that dry thinking is

2964.42 --> 2967.48
basically

2965.56 --> 2972.18
a channel

2967.48 --> 2972.18
like Jose's is that what you're saying

2973.48 --> 2979.0
that he's really just

2975.88 --> 2983.4
there to entertain the ballers

2979.0 --> 2983.4
is that what you're saying Jeff gas said

2985.42 --> 2988.539
[Music]

3004.859 --> 3008.0989999999997
he lets them paint themselves into a

3007.079 --> 3009.6600000000003
corner

3008.099 --> 3012.38
okay but

3009.66 --> 3012.3799999999997
right

3012.859 --> 3016.88

yeah I mean

3083.37 --> 3086.64
[Music]

3084.54 --> 3088.38
is it really painting themselves in a

3086.64 --> 3090.859

3088.38 --> 3090.859
six hours

3100.5 --> 3103.5
foreign

3125.0 --> 3128.38
[Music]

3138.44 --> 3142.099
what was the challenge

3150.72 --> 3156.5589999999997
I mean I I did not

3154.4 --> 3159.6600000000003
really see

3156.559 --> 3161.46
the vast majority of the show I wasn't

3159.66 --> 3163.319
even sure I just noticed at some point

3161.46 --> 3166.099
that they were just still talking about

3163.319 --> 3166.099
the horizon

3167.54 --> 3173.94
that's like the only technical argument

3170.22 --> 3176.9399999999996
that I could still live out of that

3173.94 --> 3176.94

[Music]

3194.33 --> 3198.56
[Music]

3204.42 --> 3208.319
or did they actually talk about that

3206.7 --> 3210.1189999999997
most of the time

3208.319 --> 3213.02
didn't seem to be talking about that

3210.119 --> 3213.02

[Music]

3280.26 --> 3282.26
um

3300.359 --> 3305.16
well look

3303.119 --> 3309.1800000000003
there is some things you could probably

3305.16 --> 3312.359
talk about with the baller about ligo

3309.18 --> 3314.819
Beyond oh it's a presupposed thing of

3312.359 --> 3317.0989999999997
course but just about

3314.819 --> 3319.74
the reading what you're actually reading

3317.099 --> 3323.099
how did they get that data

3319.74 --> 3324.839
how was that established how was that

3323.099 --> 3327.1800000000003
photograph

3324.839 --> 3331.7
allegedly

3327.18 --> 3331.7
just about the visuals themselves right

3333.48 --> 3336.44
I mean can

3337.339 --> 3342.42
telescopes

3338.94 --> 3345.2000000000003
even give those types of sites

3342.42 --> 3345.2000000000003
with anything

3352.26 --> 3358.3390000000004
all right how how are they supposed to

3354.3 --> 3358.3390000000004
get like a focused image out of that

3359.16 --> 3362.48
at these distances

3363.18 --> 3367.6189999999997
I don't think that's even possible

3364.68 --> 3369.0589999999997
that's why I am just presuming like with

3367.619 --> 3372.839
everything else

3369.059 --> 3374.0400000000004
just probably take a few pixels on some

3372.839 --> 3376.44
photo

3374.04 --> 3380.04
and then they unleash artists on it like

3376.44 --> 3382.319
okay you just fill this in

3380.04 --> 3384.119
so that they can have like an original

3382.319 --> 3387.24
actual

3384.119 --> 3389.46
photograph which barely shows anything

3387.24 --> 3392.16
and then they have the enhanced version

3389.46 --> 3394.38
where it's all basically filled in by

3392.16 --> 3397.16
artists and then it becomes this amazing

3394.38 --> 3397.1600000000003
beautiful thing

3407.099 --> 3411.2400000000002
they set straight lines pins

3410.01 --> 3413.7700000000004
[Music]

3411.24 --> 3416.8799999999997
oh

3413.77 --> 3416.88
[Music]

3435.96 --> 3441.54
yeah that's also part of the reason like

3439.559 --> 3443.6400000000003
I don't want to go up against Ballers

3441.54 --> 3446.96
anymore

3443.64 --> 3446.96
because of that reason

3447.059 --> 3451.92
because the double speak that they now

3449.28 --> 3455.3390000000004
utilize has become so

3451.92 --> 3457.98
overt so painful

3455.339 --> 3460.68
it's just not worth having a discussion

3457.98 --> 3463.26
about the ball anymore

3460.68 --> 3467.0989999999997
I mean I'm pretty sure that Ballwin is

3463.26 --> 3469.88
right now the purest baller

3467.099 --> 3469.88
out there

3470.76 --> 3475.38
I mean you actually want to have a

3472.68 --> 3478.859
conversation with a baller an actual one

3475.38 --> 3480.7200000000003
one that's not turned into a sick double

3478.859 --> 3482.4
speaking demon that doesn't know what

3480.72 --> 3485.0989999999997
the [ __ ] they're saying anymore

3482.4 --> 3487.92
me come to me

3485.099 --> 3490.5
I can do it I can be bowling I mean

3487.92 --> 3492.92
that's not exclusive to the Flat Earth

3490.5 --> 3492.92

that's right Baldwin is the best Glover

3495.599 --> 3499.46
they have I am I know

3500.46 --> 3506.46
but even that side of me

3503.7 --> 3509.7599999999998
it's just not worth it anymore it's not

3506.46 --> 3511.92
worth Turk talking to these crazy double

3509.76 --> 3513.78
speakers

3511.92 --> 3516.1800000000003
say

3513.78 --> 3518.52
four three years ago it was actually

3516.18 --> 3521.04
kind of entertaining I've had some

3518.52 --> 3523.14
really entertaining conversations with

3521.04 --> 3525.0
rumpus or where I was in the panel with

3523.14 --> 3527.299
rompers and then we would kind of team

3525.0 --> 3527.299
up

3527.4 --> 3533.339
because at least back then he wasn't

3530.46 --> 3535.02
just straight out double speaking about

3533.339 --> 3537.0589999999997
everything he would actually be

3535.02 --> 3538.74
corrected within the ball lore and then

3537.059 --> 3541.2000000000003
get it straight

3538.74 --> 3544.22
and he would correct me and I like that

3541.2 --> 3548.7
it's not out there anymore

3544.22 --> 3552.319
it's become a Pure weaponized

3548.7 --> 3552.319
political system to them

3554.579 --> 3558.8390000000004
it comes down to they basically don't

3556.44 --> 3560.76
want to argue

3558.839 --> 3565.339
their Globe anymore they don't actually

3560.76 --> 3565.3390000000004
want to argue they just want us to stop

3605.48 --> 3612.2400000000002
I'm still introducing new Concepts

3610.079 --> 3616.02
right

3612.24 --> 3618.24
and actually forging it into the

3616.02 --> 3620.16
alternative

3618.24 --> 3621.8999999999996
heliocentric lore it is basically

3620.16 --> 3623.52
anti-flatter at this point but it

3621.9 --> 3626.339
doesn't matter

3623.52 --> 3629.7
like lunar refraction

3626.339 --> 3633.38
why do parallel light rays from the Sun

3629.7 --> 3633.3799999999997
leave an umbrella penumbra

3633.9 --> 3639.42
from the Moon on the earth well

3637.14 --> 3642.1189999999997
lunar refraction like terrestrial

3639.42 --> 3644.16
refraction it bends it even though it

3642.119 --> 3646.799
went straight because it's going past

3644.16 --> 3650.18
the Moon

3646.799 --> 3650.18
that's refracted

3653.579 --> 3658.079
at 1 6.

3655.64 --> 3660.5989999999997
or something

3658.079 --> 3663.5800000000004
a terrestrial refraction amount

3660.599 --> 3665.4
it yeah but it doesn't even

3663.58 --> 3666.7799999999997
[Music]

3665.4 --> 3668.28
yeah

3666.78 --> 3671.28
I mean terrestrial refraction

3668.28 --> 3673.38
technically is a tool a mathematical

3671.28 --> 3677.1600000000003
tool specifically

3673.38 --> 3677.1600000000003
machination two

3677.339 --> 3682.619
literally pull straight what should be a

3680.46 --> 3684.799
globe visually

3682.619 --> 3684.799
foreign

3693.42 --> 3698.7000000000003
then well the moon should have some too

3695.94 --> 3700.44
less of course much less

3698.7 --> 3703.799
but some

3700.44 --> 3705.48
so on the moon with lunar refraction it

3703.799 --> 3708.059
would look

3705.48 --> 3709.619
still very much like a ball compared to

3708.059 --> 3712.1400000000003
the earth because it's smaller and

3709.619 --> 3715.4
there's less of this

3712.14 --> 3715.4
R based refraction

3717.299 --> 3722.819
but yeah that is indeed at least enough

3719.819 --> 3725.22
to suggest oh why doesn't the moon get

3722.819 --> 3727.2
this weird Shadow then when it's getting

3725.22 --> 3729.5989999999997
when it's eclipsing the Sun

3727.2 --> 3730.98
well because of lunar refraction

3729.599 --> 3734.2200000000003
right

3730.98 --> 3736.559
like one of the few options

3734.22 --> 3738.9599999999996
given out by terrestrial refraction it

3736.559 --> 3741.26
actually solves something out there in

3738.96 --> 3741.26
the model

3742.44 --> 3747.54
it didn't need to but yeah I just

3745.26 --> 3749.7000000000003
connected it like yeah

3747.54 --> 3754.38
limiter refraction of course Umbra

3749.7 --> 3756.299
penumbra before it was all parallel

3754.38 --> 3758.04
I mean it doesn't make sense but it

3756.299 --> 3761.04
doesn't have to make sense you just have

3758.04 --> 3764.72
to seem to make sense that's the almost

3761.04 --> 3764.72
makes sense that's how it all works

3790.92 --> 3796.339
in the next year

3792.72 --> 3796.339
in the next few months

3802.5 --> 3806.76
because lunar refraction is a concept

3804.9 --> 3809.339
definitely addresses an issue that

3806.76 --> 3812.2900000000004
before has just never been addressed

3809.339 --> 3814.0789999999997

his elect I don't know which one

3833.099 --> 3839.7000000000003
I've heard of electric universe theory

3836.04 --> 3841.2599999999998
is he one is he like a guy that made a

3839.7 --> 3844.799
movie out of it because there is like

3841.26 --> 3848.2400000000002
movies made about the electric universe

3844.799 --> 3848.24
from some time ago

3851.52 --> 3855.02
like documentary style

[Music]

3879.96 --> 3885.2400000000002

3882.24 --> 3888.74
yeah it's the electric universe

3885.24 --> 3888.74
guy who made Thunderbolts

3892.92 --> 3897.2400000000002
what do I think about it it's

3897.54 --> 3901.98
typical it's just like yeah I always

3900.66 --> 3906.299
thought like yeah that's the next

3901.98 --> 3908.94
logical conclusion Within heliocentrism

3906.299 --> 3911.46
that the sun is in the burning ball like

3908.94 --> 3914.819
ass that's not burning but that it's

3911.46 --> 3917.42
being electrified like a gas lamp

3914.819 --> 3922.819
makes more sense

3917.42 --> 3922.819
within a heliocentric framework sort of

3925.92 --> 3930.42
before I became a flat earther like

3928.5 --> 3932.64
consciously

3930.42 --> 3935.28
I was all about the electric Universe I

3932.64 --> 3937.24
thought that was like yeah of course of

3935.28 --> 3940.42
course that's it

3937.24 --> 3940.4199999999996
[Music]

3943.74 --> 3948.24
I mean hydrogen isn't just gonna keep

3946.5 --> 3952.099
burning and burning and burning for

3948.24 --> 3952.0989999999997
billions of years that's ridiculous

3957.119 --> 3962.2200000000003
but if it was electrified

3960.119 --> 3965.28
then yeah it could potentially last

3962.22 --> 3967.52
forever how long the electricity is just

3965.28 --> 3967.52
there

4005.359 --> 4008.2

4014.619 --> 4018.38
yeah yeah I remember that yeah no it's

4017.24 --> 4020.9599999999996
great

4018.38 --> 4023.359
I mean as a heliocentric model the

4020.96 --> 4026.299
electric Universe Works much much lot

4023.359 --> 4029.24
more logical much better

4026.299 --> 4030.44
it's still a mess though

4029.24 --> 4035.319
but

4030.44 --> 4035.319
it's a slightly more cohesive mess

I'm Gonna Take It To The Next Step

4067.76 --> 4072.92
I don't think

4070.16 --> 4074.66
I think somebody's even already like

4072.92 --> 4077.599
declared this or something I've already

4074.66 --> 4078.98
heard about this

4077.599 --> 4080.839
maybe it was through my Dark World

4078.98 --> 4082.46
stations maybe I heard it like in the

4080.839 --> 4085.0589999999997
late 90s somewhere

4082.46 --> 4085.059
TV

4085.28 --> 4090.7400000000002
that that's a step Beyond not electric

4087.92 --> 4095.14
universe but a holographic universe that

4090.74 --> 4095.14
is actually just a giant hologram

4102.739 --> 4107.839
foreign but then if you did that then

4105.62 --> 4110.48
you get like really bizarre

4107.839 --> 4114.199
complications namely oh you so it's not

4110.48 --> 4116.54
actually there then yeah it isn't

4114.199 --> 4117.45
it's just a hologram

4116.54 --> 4118.819
it always was

4117.45 --> 4120.739
[Music]

4118.819 --> 4122.299

4120.739 --> 4126.3189999999995
point

4122.299 --> 4128.6
of the yeah of heliocentrism where there

4126.319 --> 4132.02
is the point is that you're supposed to

4128.6 --> 4133.339
be able to go to other places out there

4132.02 --> 4135.92
well

4133.339 --> 4139.9
the universe is holographic

4184.16 --> 4188.38
what are you talking about Mary hinge

4189.199 --> 4192.879999999999
there's so much we just don't know

4195.98 --> 4203.239
but I think that my conception

4200.0 --> 4207.5
of the celestial OB celestials or being

4203.239 --> 4209.9
holographic is very much known now

4207.5 --> 4212.06
I mean I don't know how

4209.9 --> 4214.179
but I'm pretty sure that that is what it

4212.06 --> 4214.179
is

4216.44 --> 4219.74
in the real world by the way not just as

4219.02 --> 4227.21
a concept

4219.74 --> 4227.21
[Music]

4229.82 --> 4234.38
is it just my idea I don't know I think

4233.0 --> 4237.02
I've heard

4234.38 --> 4240.9800000000005
although we're heliocenters I think I

4237.02 --> 4244.46
heard Helios interests say it before

4240.98 --> 4246.799999999999
suggest that now it's actually all just

4244.46 --> 4248.6
light there's no objects there I think

4246.8 --> 4251.12
I've heard it before

4248.6 --> 4254.719
but that was still within the framework

4251.12 --> 4256.9
of of yeah Julius centers of an outer

4254.719 --> 4256.9
space

4259.1 --> 4265.9400000000005
I mean my Approach

4261.82 --> 4267.799999999999
was the holographic celestials is within

4265.94 --> 4271.5199999999995
The Limited

4267.8 --> 4273.92
confine of of the realm of Earth

4271.52 --> 4276.620000000001
so there is nothing out there

4273.92 --> 4278.719
except apparent lights

4276.62 --> 4281.12
Holograms

4278.719 --> 4282.43
I'd like to say that's my idea I think

4281.12 --> 4283.699
that others have also

4282.43 --> 4285.5
[Music]

4283.699 --> 4287.9
pondered upon that

4285.5 --> 4291.26
but the more widely known ideas

4287.9 --> 4293.9
alternative ideas are like oh but oh

4291.26 --> 4297.5
maybe it's all plasma or something which

4293.9 --> 4300.5599999999995
would require it to be actual objects in

4297.5 --> 4304.78
in actual positions in space

4300.56 --> 4304.780000000001
I do not have that problem with my model

4309.98 --> 4315.0199999999995
so no I have not really heard a lot of

4313.04 --> 4318.14
people out there just saying that no

4315.02 --> 4320.42
it's it's holographic although there is

4318.14 --> 4322.1
some people that say that the moon's a

4320.42 --> 4324.4400000000005
hologram

4322.1 --> 4328.34
but that's been like classified as like

4324.44 --> 4331.0599999999995
big Food level conspiracy theory now

4328.34 --> 4331.06
so

4331.94 --> 4338.839999999999
even though it's absolutely true

4335.6 --> 4342.58
because the Moon is definitely not a
