and it was even kind of weird because I

282.84 --> 286.52
don't know some people have might yeah

285.08 --> 287.919
especially when you get older you get

286.52 --> 291.32
reoccurring

287.919 --> 294.84
ailments that always follow a typical

291.32 --> 296.88
pattern unless they get worse but yeah

294.84 --> 300.039
that's not really happening too much

296.88 --> 302.32
here but certain like typ type of

300.039 --> 304.24
symptoms now like it's almost like

302.32 --> 307.36
through the Regeneration things have

304.24 --> 310.36
changed it's like what

307.36 --> 310.36
oh

312.16 --> 318.03900000000004
okay so yeah sort of certain ailment

315.52 --> 318.039
seem to have

318.319 --> 323.12
like

320.199 --> 327.24
regressed which I'm very happy about cuz

323.12 --> 327.24
those have been like plaguing me for

328.479 --> 331.479
decades

342.28 --> 345.35999999999996
now you got snowfall

347.6 --> 350.6
clutch

352.759 --> 358.12
huh yeah well it gets a lot colder in

355.44 --> 361.479
the in

358.12 --> 364.759
Canada and the north of

361.479 --> 364.75899999999996
us right

370.24 --> 375.96000000000004
anyway yeah no fed again yesterday

373.599 --> 380.36
either so it was pretty much only QE

375.96 --> 380.35999999999996
live in the evening Bad Moon

380.8 --> 388.28000000000003
Shadow and for me oh Benjamin I watched

383.8 --> 388.28000000000003
that and infow wars and all

388.4 --> 391.4
that

405.479 --> 408.56
the song was the worst

411.8 --> 416.56
thing

413.56 --> 421.4
H it's just really

416.56 --> 421.4
funny but yeah it is the worst

429.51 --> 432.74
[Music]

436.56 --> 439.919
hello o good to see

444.639 --> 451.599
you right and yeah no fed today either

448.36 --> 455.08000000000004
it seems is just

451.599 --> 458.44
having continual

455.08 --> 461.599
calamities like he got his computer back

458.44 --> 465.84
from the repair guy and it like doesn't

461.599 --> 471.639
work or we got something back so it's

465.84 --> 471.63899999999995
just yeah he's in a bad mood I

473.52 --> 480.44
think I hope it will work out

478.08 --> 481.31899999999996
eventually and yeah he still sent me

480.44 --> 483.4
that

481.319 --> 484.91900000000004
monitor I don't know when it's going to

483.4 --> 486.31899999999996
arrive and how that's going to work I

484.919 --> 490.31899999999996
hope they're not going to leave it

486.319 --> 493.759
somewhere like oh just collect it here

490.319 --> 496.91900000000004
what collect a monitor on my bike yeah

493.759 --> 496.91900000000004
there's no way that's going to

497.28 --> 501.84
work so I really hope that's not the

508.24 --> 511.24
case

518.12 --> 521.919
hey Richard G good good to see

525.72 --> 529.08

538.2 --> 541.2
CCR

543.32 --> 549.36
right anyway good to see you

545.24 --> 552.32
all hope you're having a less dreary

549.36 --> 552.32
morning than I

554.519 --> 560.64
have and I feel completely blank too I

557.76 --> 564.0
mean I had a full day and all that but I

560.64 --> 564.0
mean I really just

566.48 --> 571.12
like I be yeah

574.64 --> 579.68
I didn't get any brilliant ideas over

577.48 --> 579.6800000000001
the

580.399 --> 585.56
night although look I've come up with so

583.519 --> 587.399
many different things like on my show in

585.56 --> 590.16
recent times

587.399 --> 592.839
that they're not just at the

590.16 --> 596.64
ready but if somebody reminded me of

592.839 --> 596.6400000000001
anything that will always get me

598.12 --> 601.12
going

606.079 --> 610.279
it's a

607.56 --> 613.279
band

610.279 --> 613.279
DW

617.64 --> 625.76
okay creton clear water

622.76 --> 625.76
revival

628.04 --> 631.04
h

631.519 --> 638.16
Fortunate Son

634.04 --> 638.16
nope never heard of any of

649.36 --> 655.32
that Proud Mary never heard of it at

653.399 --> 657.519
least by name you know maybe I've heard

655.32 --> 659.6800000000001
one of those songs at some point or

657.519 --> 661.48
something but

659.68 --> 665.16
I have no idea

661.48 --> 665.16
about any of those

675.399 --> 680.2
names

677.2 --> 680.2
H

687.959 --> 690.959
Maybe

692.68 --> 697.4799999999999
I mean if it's like songs that typically

695.24 --> 701.04
would come on the radio in the90s or

697.48 --> 701.04
whatever then I probably heard

716.839 --> 720.9590000000001
it right anyhow

725.02 --> 728.0799999999999
[Music]

747.88 --> 750.88
for

768.61 --> 771.69
[Music]

777.839 --> 780.839
for

783.279 --> 788.279
all right yeah I haven't like I have

786.12 --> 789.92
watched some like I continued watching

788.279 --> 793.0
that series

789.92 --> 795.279
bodies and it was there was something

793.0 --> 797.72
interesting of course it had they had to

795.279 --> 800.48
have some freaking gay [ __ ] in there too

797.72 --> 803.1990000000001
I hate it when they do that I can't like

800.48 --> 806.639
literally skip those scenes thank

803.199 --> 807.519
God it's like oh oh they might be Parts

806.639 --> 809.44
I don't

807.519 --> 813.6
care [ __ ]

809.44 --> 815.5600000000001
H I'm not watching that I don't care I

813.6 --> 818.6800000000001
don't want to be I don't want to know

815.56 --> 820.6389999999999
about that didn't need like it was kind

818.68 --> 824.5999999999999
of interesting

820.639 --> 827.5600000000001
though but it was kind of weird and

824.6 --> 829.639
silly it was it was like real it was

827.56 --> 833.4799999999999
time-based science

829.639 --> 836.839
fiction but basically was resting on a

833.48 --> 840.0790000000001
paradox like it doesn't make any

836.839 --> 842.48
sense but it was very

840.079 --> 846.5999999999999
entertaining to try that out as a

842.48 --> 849.12
paradox it's almost a little bit like oh

846.6 --> 852.24
oh like

849.12 --> 854.24
Bravada to do that in a movie I mean who

852.24 --> 856.5600000000001
gives a [ __ ] anyway I mean this stuff

854.24 --> 856.5600000000001
doesn't

862.0 --> 867.639
exist and yeah I don't know I don't want

864.32 --> 869.519
to if I just explain it that would like

867.639 --> 871.839
spoil the whole ser series if you want

869.519 --> 874.399
to watch

871.839 --> 877.639
it but it's really

874.399 --> 882.44
funny and it sort of comes down to

877.639 --> 882.44
like I am my own

886.56 --> 893.1199999999999
father what is it on it's

890.0 --> 897.16
about well it's very similar to

893.12 --> 901.0
dark where there is some time travel

897.16 --> 903.24
thing sort of a gate and it's really

901.0 --> 904.56
cool it's really I mean what they did

903.24 --> 908.44
all with

904.56 --> 912.2399999999999
it like the style of it was really cool

908.44 --> 914.24
like I really appreciated it it felt

912.24 --> 916.639
very real and like eventually like

914.24 --> 920.279
there's like paradoxical

916.639 --> 923.0790000000001
erasing and that is like that creeped me

920.279 --> 926.72
out how freaking real that seemed like

923.079 --> 926.7199999999999
it's just like oh

927.6 --> 930.6
Jesus

931.279 --> 936.079
like sort of the idea of

934.24 --> 938.839
uh what is

936.079 --> 940.959
it of Back to the Future like oh

938.839 --> 946.1600000000001
paradoxical erasing oh I'm starting to

940.959 --> 946.88
fade out but like no not so Dramatical

946.16 --> 950.279
and

946.88 --> 953.48
silly and it was just really shocking a

950.279 --> 953.48
lot about it was really

955.079 --> 959.399
shocking but fascinating like it was

957.68 --> 962.319
like one of those real mystery things

959.399 --> 965.36
that keeps pulling for I did like bodies

962.319 --> 967.279
but I mean I really did not like the

965.36 --> 969.839
freaking gay [ __ ] in there it's just

967.279 --> 972.759
like as far as I'm concerned I would

969.839 --> 974.9590000000001
like create another like I would go

972.759 --> 977.88
through the gates specifically to

974.959 --> 982.16
prevent that freaking gay [ __ ] from

977.88 --> 983.959
happening and then have the perfect

982.16 --> 985.6
series

983.959 --> 988.079
anyway

985.6 --> 990.9200000000001
H it was kind of interesting and the

988.079 --> 990.92
style was very

993.519 --> 998.079
cool cuz they did like a bit of a split

996.279 --> 1000.6
screen thing like

998.079 --> 1005.0
24

1000.6 --> 1007.0400000000001
almost throughout the times and it was

1005.0 --> 1010.44
just all kinds of things it was it was

1007.04 --> 1013.7199999999999
cool except for the gay [ __ ] it's like I

1010.44 --> 1017.48
don't care about your freaking oh it was

1013.72 --> 1021.0400000000001
so tough for G back [ __ ] you just

1017.48 --> 1023.6
freaking [ __ ] up off I don't care how

1021.04 --> 1025.559
much you had trouble being in the closet

1023.6 --> 1028.559
[ __ ]

1025.559 --> 1028.559
off

1032.079 --> 1035.608
[Music]

1037.12 --> 1042.9589999999998
sorry what streaming service has I don't

1040.039 --> 1046.4
know it was on Netflix I think it's like

1042.959 --> 1046.4
one of those Netflix only

1047.4 --> 1050.4
series

1051.5 --> 1055.799
[Music]

1053.84 --> 1058.8799999999999
right so yeah but I finished watching

1055.799 --> 1062.84
that like days ago actually I just been

1058.88 --> 1062.8400000000001
really I needed to let it sink for a

1065.12 --> 1072.84
bit I also watched another

1068.88 --> 1073.8000000000002
movie and that thing like was really

1072.84 --> 1076.839
[ __ ]

1073.8 --> 1076.839
[Music]

1077.039 --> 1083.4
up also on Netflix of course but that

1080.52 --> 1086.72
was a Hollywood movie with Matt

1083.4 --> 1091.96
Damon and he did an absolutely amazing

1086.72 --> 1095.44
job in it though I mean it is quite

1091.96 --> 1095.44
amazing what he can

1096.64 --> 1103.2800000000002
do but yeah the movie was it The

1100.32 --> 1105.6
Talented Mr Ripley and it starts out

1103.28 --> 1109.2
like wow this is like actual talent this

1105.6 --> 1111.76
is really cool and then like it gets

1109.2 --> 1114.24
really [ __ ] up and then continues to

1111.76 --> 1119.0
get more [ __ ] up and and then of

1114.24 --> 1121.72
course [ __ ] gay like oh I hate it no

1119.0 --> 1125.039
you ruined everything like it ruined the

1121.72 --> 1128.32
entire [ __ ] thing for me like yeah

1125.039 --> 1131.44
now I freaking hate you

1128.32 --> 1133.48
all like I really wanted to like that

1131.44 --> 1137.0800000000002
guy because he was talented but he was

1133.48 --> 1141.679
just like such a disgusting scumbag in

1137.08 --> 1141.6789999999999
the end like

1145.08 --> 1150.96
just that is a

1148.32 --> 1154.1589999999999
remake oh

1150.96 --> 1157.44
okay I didn't know it was a remake it

1154.159 --> 1157.44
was very well

1165.559 --> 1172.6399999999999
done like it had it had the feeling like

1168.6 --> 1177.08
it was some sort of a spy situation

1172.64 --> 1177.0800000000002
but it just got really [ __ ]

1182.51 --> 1185.65
[Music]

1186.919 --> 1191.3600000000001
up right anyway I got an Illumina go on

1189.96 --> 1193.96
here and I'm

1191.36 --> 1197.079
really wanting to take a bite out of

1193.96 --> 1197.079
[Music]

1197.24 --> 1200.24
this

1204.36 --> 1211.6399999999999
but yeah that movie is messed

1207.76 --> 1213.6
up like that's one that you like yeah

1211.64 --> 1215.5200000000002
both of them really are like you have to

1213.6 --> 1219.799
keep that away from

1215.52 --> 1221.4
kids but uh yeah I mean most people

1219.799 --> 1224.4
realize that very

1221.4 --> 1224.4
easily

1227.159 --> 1230.96
uh

1228.72 --> 1233.08
so yeah

1230.96 --> 1235.96
that's

1233.08 --> 1239.9189999999999
some movie stuff

1235.96 --> 1239.919
series I've been watching

1243.679 --> 1250.799
and it's kind of funny now hearing on

1246.679 --> 1254.88
Infowars like the positions of the guys

1250.799 --> 1257.1589999999999
and and Alex and about the whole Israel

1254.88 --> 1258.96
situation also because some of things

1257.159 --> 1262.64
that I said

1258.96 --> 1265.64
like before I went it all like bar Mo

1262.64 --> 1267.96
which is really stupid and I definitely

1265.64 --> 1269.76
didn't mean that and I don't mean it if

1267.96 --> 1273.72
I say it

1269.76 --> 1276.559
now right not saying

1273.72 --> 1280.2
it but the things that I said beside it

1276.559 --> 1282.84
like yeah they seem like pretty fullon

1280.2 --> 1287.039
control opposition they're like both

1282.84 --> 1290.84
satanic like yeah

1287.039 --> 1290.84
that's they figured it

1291.159 --> 1298.0
out like Hamas is like its own separate

1294.36 --> 1300.84
agent basically doesn't do anything that

1298.0 --> 1303.12
is benefits any

1300.84 --> 1308.48
Palestinian they're like satanists that

1303.12 --> 1311.6399999999999
are just like probably in some way like

1308.48 --> 1314.48
taking money and it's like it's crazy

1311.64 --> 1314.48
that that's

1317.039 --> 1320.039
there

1321.559 --> 1326.6399999999999
right anyway I'm not going to go too

1323.799 --> 1329.2
deeply into it but I'm or not at all

1326.64 --> 1333.1200000000001
basically cuz that'll just ruin my mood

1329.2 --> 1335.32
and everybody will go crazy

1333.12 --> 1340.08
again but

1335.32 --> 1344.8799999999999
uh it's kind of funny to see them like

1340.08 --> 1344.8799999999999
really getting it in

1346.96 --> 1349.96
ways

1355.799 --> 1361.96
right and weird situations going on with

1358.72 --> 1361.96
uh with

1362.44 --> 1370.0
Bobby right Sly going

1367.76 --> 1372.8799999999999
communist that's

1370.0 --> 1374.84
weird Alex having a theory about he how

1372.88 --> 1377.64
he's making asymmetrical

1374.84 --> 1379.6
Maneuvers basically like spy work and

1377.64 --> 1382.48
yeah could be

1379.6 --> 1384.9189999999999
right but it still like gives me the

1382.48 --> 1386.44
creeps man that guy gives me the creeps

1384.919 --> 1388.24
and now he does something like this and

1386.44 --> 1390.88
yeah that gives me the

1388.24 --> 1393.08
creeps I knew he had that kind of thing

1390.88 --> 1393.0800000000002
in

1397.4 --> 1407.48
him flip-flopping basically right and uh

1403.84 --> 1410.6399999999999
oh God in this interview yesterday Jesus

1407.48 --> 1416.32
I is ter here by the

1410.64 --> 1416.3200000000002
way H Alex Jones went with that

1416.44 --> 1425.039
W that that Shiva

1420.24 --> 1429.279
clone and he's oh my God that guy is so

1425.039 --> 1434.039
freaking gross he is and they

1429.279 --> 1438.08
literally they literally just

1434.039 --> 1442.08
copied everything that Shiva said about

1438.08 --> 1446.48
how that guy is a copy of him and then

1442.08 --> 1449.76
pretended like like that's happening to

1446.48 --> 1453.52
him that was like one of the the

1449.76 --> 1458.24
grossest most slippery things I've ever

1453.52 --> 1462.9189999999999
seen Alex like gushingly take part in I

1458.24 --> 1468.159
mean that was like a Brotherhood of

1462.919 --> 1469.48
grifter Peak situation there and Alex is

1468.159 --> 1474.1200000000001
like

1469.48 --> 1475.96
yeah he loves it oh my God is he part of

1474.12 --> 1477.36
the Brotherhood of grifters and he

1475.96 --> 1482.1200000000001
[ __ ] knows

1477.36 --> 1484.8799999999999
it and I don't know man it's so [ __ ]

1482.12 --> 1487.039
up and I said like oh Shiva for

1484.88 --> 1490.8400000000001
president like in the comment section

1487.039 --> 1493.36
there and I got like this in gigantic

1490.84 --> 1496.52
comment response from some guy that was

1493.36 --> 1500.12
like oh no he's

1496.52 --> 1503.12
a what is it again like he's a Clinton

1500.12 --> 1508.6789999999999
agent cuz he made like some email system

1503.12 --> 1508.6789999999999
for a Clinton company like what the

1510.0 --> 1517.08
[ __ ] like there was some serious chill

1513.919 --> 1520.5200000000002
bastard trolling like go going around

1517.08 --> 1523.24
and like being like ah let me bury you

1520.52 --> 1525.76
under these supposed

1523.24 --> 1528.52
facts like it was a whole baller thing

1525.76 --> 1532.64
or what crazy [ __ ] I mean Brotherhood of

1528.52 --> 1534.96
grifters guys it's what it is is these

1532.64 --> 1538.72
people maniacally defending it's almost

1534.96 --> 1542.44
like a new Roman empire style it's like

1538.72 --> 1544.799
no we [ __ ] make up whatever we want

1542.44 --> 1547.44
it's all there to just get everybody on

1544.799 --> 1549.6
our side as long as they like don't

1547.44 --> 1551.159
really understand too much because then

1549.6 --> 1553.8799999999999
they'll see like what the hell we're

1551.159 --> 1558.3200000000002
doing is like

1553.88 --> 1562.5590000000002
crazy like literally like just using the

1558.32 --> 1565.2
same tactics as the Communist Empire the

1562.559 --> 1568.799
emperium and doing Marxist like

1565.2 --> 1571.919
completely copying gaslighting like that

1568.799 --> 1571.9189999999999
it's so [ __ ]

1577.08 --> 1584.279
up the brother yeah brother of grifters

1580.44 --> 1586.24
is growing do you know David no night

1584.279 --> 1589.6
yeah yeah yeah I'm subscribed to him

1586.24 --> 1589.6
like on D life

1590.72 --> 1598.64
it's it's kind of bland but he does a

1595.84 --> 1601.48
good job of keeping his

1598.64 --> 1604.24
level but it's like it's like American

1601.48 --> 1606.3990000000001
it's political it's like I know he has

1604.24 --> 1608.44
like a a

1606.399 --> 1611.6399999999999
market there's going to be a lot of

1608.44 --> 1613.2
people out there especially if the older

1611.64 --> 1616.24
Generations that are really going to

1613.2 --> 1620.2
appreciate that but I mean for me it's

1616.24 --> 1624.2
not super fascinating to listen

1620.2 --> 1625.24
to sometimes I tune in but it goes live

1624.2 --> 1628.48
like every

1625.24 --> 1628.48
day every

1628.88 --> 1632.0800000000002
weekday hey

1635.12 --> 1641.9599999999998
T tap on the shoulder but it's for

1638.919 --> 1645.919
what for what ter what the hell would I

1641.96 --> 1645.919
have done for the CIA to do

1646.52 --> 1649.52
that

1652.48 --> 1657.3600000000001
I've kept all their

1654.64 --> 1659.5590000000002
secrets waited all till the right time

1657.36 --> 1662.0
with

1659.559 --> 1664.9189999999999
everything I would have just sounded

1662.0 --> 1666.44
crazy anyway right if they had tapped on

1664.919 --> 1671.519
my shoulders they would have done that

1666.44 --> 1671.519
years ago not now like I'm

1671.72 --> 1680.279
not I'm not saying anything too much not

1675.279 --> 1680.279
spilling their into dimensional

1683.32 --> 1686.76
beans anyway

1700.4 --> 1705.3090000000002
[Music]

1706.44 --> 1709.44
cheers

1716.799 --> 1722.6399999999999
for being outright hardcore content too

1719.08 --> 1724.399
hot for YouTube

1722.64 --> 1726.44
well

1724.399 --> 1729.4399999999998
what that's

1726.44 --> 1733.919
ridiculous they would just kick me

1729.44 --> 1735.559
off then so I'm too hot for YouTube well

1733.919 --> 1738.96
why the hell would they give me a visit

1735.559 --> 1741.1589999999999
they would just like shut my channel off

1738.96 --> 1741.159
or

1744.12 --> 1749.84
something oh my God I took I tried to

1747.039 --> 1751.84
take a look on Rumble yesterday but what

1749.84 --> 1756.0
they showed me on the front page was

1751.84 --> 1757.84
like oh my God everything I see here is

1756.0 --> 1761.519
so [ __ ]

1757.84 --> 1766.1589999999999
atrocious it made me want to throw

1761.519 --> 1769.36
up it was so shouty so dumb I can't

1766.159 --> 1771.7990000000002
believe that that's normal

1769.36 --> 1775.32
there

1771.799 --> 1779.0
oh and I thought [ __ ] stuff was on

1775.32 --> 1779.0
YouTube holy

1786.96 --> 1794.279
[ __ ] they need to opposite to exist

1790.679 --> 1799.3200000000002
that's why they don't ban me yeah sort

1794.279 --> 1799.32
of maybe I don't know

1801.399 --> 1806.039
I think I'm one of those guys where they

1803.32 --> 1808.4399999999998
just put me in a classification like we

1806.039 --> 1811.08
don't know what the [ __ ] to do with

1808.44 --> 1813.44
this and in a way that's kind of where I

1811.08 --> 1813.4399999999998
like to

1826.24 --> 1829.24
be

1846.08 --> 1850.76
yeah maximum they go a

1848.48 --> 1853.6
strike

1850.76 --> 1856.399
well I feel

1853.6 --> 1857.9599999999998
like the system is not even really

1856.399 --> 1861.36
interested

1857.96 --> 1866.559
I think it's mostly just

1861.36 --> 1870.36
trolls trolls that are like doing it for

1866.559 --> 1872.12
them cuz it's usually like a couple of

1870.36 --> 1874.399
people out there I don't exactly even

1872.12 --> 1875.9189999999999
know who they are with certainty I mean

1874.399 --> 1878.1999999999998
there's people out there with their

1875.919 --> 1880.3990000000001
accounts that claim they do everything

1878.2 --> 1883.279
right they like there could be four

1880.399 --> 1888.039
people simultaneously claiming like I

1883.279 --> 1890.2
cost the trke oh hor [ __ ] why do know is

1888.039 --> 1894.039
that there are certain people if they

1890.2 --> 1898.24
get in a really bad mood and I explode

1894.039 --> 1898.24
they just like like try to bury my

1899.12 --> 1902.6
channel and that's

1911.399 --> 1917.9599999999998
it I mean I'm not even like these trolls

1914.919 --> 1920.48
don't even strike my channel they seem

1917.96 --> 1922.96
to be too obsessed with trying to make

1920.48 --> 1927.24
me look bad

1922.96 --> 1927.24
or just complaining about

1927.639 --> 1933.32
me to actually want to take me down it's

1930.96 --> 1936.24
like but then they don't have somebody

1933.32 --> 1938.8799999999999
to whine and complain about and make

1936.24 --> 1941.039
content in their own super super shitty

1938.88 --> 1943.6390000000001
channels of course have more subscribers

1941.039 --> 1946.08
than me of

1943.639 --> 1948.399
course

1946.08 --> 1949.96
right

1948.399 --> 1952.32
but I don't think that they're doing

1949.96 --> 1954.44
that I mean what the hell would be left

1952.32 --> 1955.399
for them like there's no more point to

1954.44 --> 1959.72
their

1955.399 --> 1959.7199999999998
lives if they actually took me

1965.0 --> 1972.399
down ironically I might

1968.32 --> 1974.76
be the final straw that is preventing

1972.399 --> 1979.039
these people from just outright killing

1974.76 --> 1979.039
themselves because they're so [ __ ]

1979.48 --> 1987.6390000000001
and me being here and them to be

1984.48 --> 1990.6
obsessively being able to bully me might

1987.639 --> 1993.12
be literally the last thing that's

1990.6 --> 1995.4399999999998
preventing them from killing

1993.12 --> 1997.6789999999999
themselves I've never thought of it like

1995.44 --> 1997.679
that

1999.38 --> 2002.519
[Music]

2005.96 --> 2008.96
before

2018.36 --> 2024.399
right yeah flat SIDS n but at flat SIDS

2022.159 --> 2029.44
there are

2024.399 --> 2033.4799999999998
some just miserable trolls troll

2029.44 --> 2035.96
guys I'm not those guys don't like

2033.48 --> 2038.159
continually make videos about

2035.96 --> 2041.3600000000001
me

2038.159 --> 2041.3600000000001
you should listen to steamy

2042.24 --> 2047.96
traveler he's seen some [ __ ] out there

2045.799 --> 2050.679
he's been digging through like troll

2047.96 --> 2050.679
channels and

2050.76 --> 2055.159
[ __ ] I've told him like maybe should cut

2053.599 --> 2057.28
down on that it's probably not too

2055.159 --> 2058.7200000000003
healthy to continually expose yourself

2057.28 --> 2062.599
to

2058.72 --> 2064.6789999999996
that but he's just out of Fascination

2062.599 --> 2068.3590000000004
gone digging around to see like what's

2064.679 --> 2071.119
out there and there's like

2068.359 --> 2076.159
just entire channels that make multiple

2071.119 --> 2079.32
videos about me a day like what the [ __ ]

2076.159 --> 2082.2000000000003
those and those guys are [ __ ]

2079.32 --> 2085.76
insane and so I'm I'm just wondering

2082.2 --> 2085.7599999999998
like am I the thing that's

2086.96 --> 2092.2
like the last thing to distract them

2089.96 --> 2094.7200000000003
before they finally collapse in on

2092.2 --> 2094.72
themselves or

2095.879 --> 2098.879
something

2100.34 --> 2103.53
[Music]

2441.88 --> 2448.319
terribly he's a terrible idiot but what

2445.92 --> 2450.7200000000003
did he do to make him the dumbest I

2448.319 --> 2450.72
don't get

2451.56 --> 2459.4
it I mean if you count with him just

2455.92 --> 2461.48
that he is actually smart but he acts

2459.4 --> 2464.88
like a complete

2461.48 --> 2467.16
[ __ ] then I get it but that's so

2464.88 --> 2469.48
disgusting with him is that he does have

2467.16 --> 2470.7999999999997
actual intelligence he just doesn't use

2469.48 --> 2473.0
it

2470.8 --> 2475.5600000000004
right it's

2473.0 --> 2476.76
aggravating it's like he continually

2475.56 --> 2479.7599999999998
abusing

2476.76 --> 2479.76
himself

2485.24 --> 2488.24

right about F snake with un Alex Jones I

2512.28 --> 2517.5600000000004

2515.16 --> 2519.2799999999997
you weren't there yet

2517.56 --> 2522.44
but that was ridiculous like they

2519.28 --> 2527.0400000000004
completely just like a bunch of marxist

2522.44 --> 2529.2400000000002
scum copied shiva's act and and

2527.04 --> 2531.96
basically we're like oh there's somebody

2529.24 --> 2536.4399999999996
out there pretending to be like me

2531.96 --> 2536.44
They're copying my ACT my Brilliance

don't pass down the line so he just

2565.359 --> 2570.16
happened to stand I don't really get it

2567.64 --> 2570.16
too much

2573.16 --> 2578.72
teret but yes he is dumb I get

2587.01 --> 2590.199
[Music]

2604.52 --> 2609.4
that right I mean passing on

2612.839 --> 2618.5589999999997
stupidity I don't yeah it's weird like

2616.04 --> 2621.079
how can there be somebody not to pass it

2618.559 --> 2624.7200000000003
on to anywhere it's like it's not like

2621.079 --> 2628.88
the stupidity isn't like a literal

2624.72 --> 2628.8799999999997
object that you can just put in a

2629.0 --> 2632.72
vault it's a weird

2635.079 --> 2644.869
one

2636.74 --> 2644.8689999999997
[Music]

2652.4 --> 2657.88
like and stupidity is like a ratio game

2655.4 --> 2660.8
too it can be very hard to

2657.88 --> 2662.8
like figure out what is really stupid

2660.8 --> 2666.8
because one thing a person in their

2662.8 --> 2669.8390000000004
behavior can seem extremely stupid until

2666.8 --> 2674.2400000000002
you then relate it to something

2669.839 --> 2676.7599999999998
else or have it interact and happen with

2674.24 --> 2678.0789999999997
something else and then the responses

2676.76 --> 2681.88
might

2678.079 --> 2684.88
be offsetting the actual

2681.88 --> 2687.52
values like other people can make things

2684.88 --> 2690.8
that are stupid become less

2687.52 --> 2690.8
stupid in

2691.96 --> 2699.52
contrast it's really weird but stupidity

2695.72 --> 2699.52
is is basically like a ratio

2706.04 --> 2712.0
game like is like what what is more

2708.96 --> 2715.0
stupid somebody that buys

2712.0 --> 2715.0
everything

2716.4 --> 2722.4
outright or somebody that refuses to buy

2719.96 --> 2722.4
basic

2724.88 --> 2727.88
logic

2730.0 --> 2735.68
Ah that's a tough one

2733.04 --> 2740.119
right I used to be the

2735.68 --> 2743.9199999999996
first like I'd buy anything like yes I

2740.119 --> 2746.319
accept because I can understand it that

2743.92 --> 2748.599
means I can imagine it and then it can

2746.319 --> 2748.599
be

2754.88 --> 2760.6800000000003
real it would be

2757.839 --> 2763.839
weird I mean I'd still have fail safe

2760.68 --> 2766.72
mechanism like I had internal security

2763.839 --> 2769.68
that would basically let me do that

2766.72 --> 2771.2
without getting in IR reable damage

2769.68 --> 2775.68
situations

2771.2 --> 2775.68

so

3031.319 --> 3037.64

for

3265.68 --> 3269.8799999999997
you seen Spider-Man meme where they

3267.68 --> 3275.24
point at each other what happened when

3269.88 --> 3277.48
they when Dr Shiva act wow I mean that

3275.24 --> 3279.9599999999996
would be the most surreal thing ever

3277.48 --> 3284.359
though tered if could you imagine that

3279.96 --> 3284.359
Dr Shiva against

3285.839 --> 3291.68
ramaswami and then he would literally he

3289.52 --> 3294.72
would just be standing there like a

3291.68 --> 3296.44
mirror just like doing exactly the same

3294.72 --> 3298.4399999999996
thing

3296.44 --> 3301.04
just saying the same thing in the same

3298.44 --> 3305.32
way every time Shiva says

3301.04 --> 3308.409
anything that would be like so

3305.32 --> 3308.409
[Music]

3312.599 --> 3318.2400000000002
freaky but I mean what would practically

3315.2 --> 3320.7599999999998
happen is that ramas Swami would just

3318.24 --> 3322.9599999999996
like start talking about the issues in

3320.76 --> 3325.4
the world and he would do his best doing

3322.96 --> 3328.2400000000002
it right and then Shiva would basically

3325.4 --> 3330.039
go like yeah but you let's talk about

3328.24 --> 3332.24
you for a minute and where you came from

3330.039 --> 3335.6400000000003
and like it would

3332.24 --> 3338.8799999999997
like totally go at home

3335.64 --> 3343.4
basically and then RW would basically

3338.88 --> 3346.44
accuse Shiva of being just a like a

3343.4 --> 3348.92
troll a troll trying to copy his act so

3346.44 --> 3352.319
he's just ad Haring it would dude it

3348.92 --> 3352.319
would be freaking

3354.0 --> 3357.0
insane

3357.119 --> 3362.6800000000003
did I see the wited Zera debate nope

3360.24 --> 3366.68
sorry D I did

3362.68 --> 3366.68
not hey Dan good to see

3372.079 --> 3376.2400000000002
you Dr Shiva would beat

3376.52 --> 3379.96
him

3378.48 --> 3382.039
[Music]

3379.96 --> 3385.52
eventually but I mean it would be

3382.039 --> 3387.76
freaking insane to behold all that like

3385.52 --> 3391.72
you would start to see like the demon

3387.76 --> 3393.44
coming out of Rama if like you would see

3391.72 --> 3396.4399999999996
like that demon from the Brotherhood of

3393.44 --> 3399.28
a grifters coming out eventually it

3396.44 --> 3399.28
would be

3413.88 --> 3416.88
crazy

3418.839 --> 3424.359
YouTube chat wouldn't allow me to send

3421.359 --> 3424.359
it in one

3425.119 --> 3430.559
what okay beat him to pop is that's

3443.799 --> 3446.799
weird

3456.119 --> 3463.039
got to check out Dr Shiva yeah yeah no

3459.4 --> 3465.44
he Dr Shiva does like daily streams like

3463.039 --> 3469.1600000000003
he gets on with people every day

3465.44 --> 3473.799
sometimes two people a day or

3469.16 --> 3475.48
something and basically does his

3473.799 --> 3477.319
thing

3475.48 --> 3480.319
I've watched a lot of it eventually it

3477.319 --> 3483.96
does get kind of like I can't just keep

3480.319 --> 3483.96
watching it every day that gets

some reason at

3619.0 --> 3626.119
F like I can't see his super chats like

3626.119 --> 3631.6400000000003
account and I cannot explain it he's not

3629.4 --> 3635.119
in the block

3631.64 --> 3635.1189999999997
list I don't get

3652.039 --> 3658.6400000000003

things like what is he well he's not

3661.64 --> 3668.52
like oh he learned all this smart stuff

3665.0 --> 3670.079
no he literally invented systems he

3668.52 --> 3673.28
invented

3670.079 --> 3675.7200000000003
things like a new biological system like

3673.28 --> 3677.079
where you can basically like input

3675.72 --> 3681.2
information

3677.079 --> 3683.48
about certain people biologically into a

3681.2 --> 3687.0789999999997
system and it'll tell you exactly what

3683.48 --> 3691.92
you need and it's like what is it like

3687.079 --> 3691.92
99% correct without

3701.0 --> 3704.0
exception

3713.44 --> 3718.359
right

3715.839 --> 3721.359
yeah that's not true Aries I don't know

3718.359 --> 3725.839
where the [ __ ] you're getting that but

3721.359 --> 3725.839
he's on record he's got the patent for

3726.079 --> 3732.6800000000003
it what is it patent he's like the the

3730.039 --> 3736.6800000000003
dec what is not a pton the

3732.68 --> 3737.8799999999997
opposite like ah did he get it pton I

3736.68 --> 3740.3999999999996
don't know where the hell he's getting

3737.88 --> 3740.4
it from

3740.799 --> 3746.359
but teret you filin

3748.079 --> 3757.48
Johnny just [ __ ]

3751.799 --> 3757.48
off you're not part of this show

3773.359 --> 3776.359
[ __ ]

3801.359 --> 3806.279
right

3803.279 --> 3806.279
interesting

3863.2 --> 3866.2
for

3876.68 --> 3880.44
don't get jailed for it

3890.64 --> 3897.92
what all right

3893.16 --> 3897.92
anyway Dr Shiva is the real

3900.319 --> 3908.96
deal he's incredibly smart and like much

3905.44 --> 3911.4
more efficient than anybody that I that

3908.96 --> 3911.4
I've ever

3917.2 --> 3923.68
seen what timeout what AR's timeout no

3920.92 --> 3926.079
he's just being an obstructive [ __ ]

3923.68 --> 3926.0789999999997
as us

3935.44 --> 3943.48
just just let him do

3938.079 --> 3943.48
that cuz yeah you can be wrong about

3945.64 --> 3950.0389999999998
that as you said there's a lot like Dr

3948.64 --> 3953.16
Shiva has had

3950.039 --> 3954.96
copycats that try to tr take credit for

3953.16 --> 3956.8799999999997
his work since he was a

3954.96 --> 3959.88
teen

3956.88 --> 3963.079
so that's going to happen the entire

3959.88 --> 3968.599
system like doesn't want him to really

3963.079 --> 3968.599
exist cuz it wants the credit for the

3970.599 --> 3974.079
scammers and not

3976.4 --> 3986.0
him yes Aries 106 I know you're just a

3979.96 --> 3986.0
useless copy paste drone I know

4008.079 --> 4011.279
does Shiva reject

4011.88 --> 4016.0
virology uh

4019.96 --> 4024.359
basically not entirely sure with the

4026.279 --> 4034.44
virology heliocentric beliefs well he

4030.119 --> 4036.92
uses those met as metaphors all the

4034.44 --> 4039.079
time yeah Google also says the

4036.92 --> 4041.079
suddenness 93 million miles away that is

4039.079 --> 4045.92
correct logical

4041.079 --> 4045.92
observations but uh

4045.96 --> 4049.44
I know Dr Shiva

4050.64 --> 4060.64
like hangs around ow Benjamin and who is

4053.88 --> 4063.7200000000003
a flat earther and like he might

4060.64 --> 4067.0789999999997
yeah like he's not an open flat earther

4063.72 --> 4068.9199999999996
if anything he's probably afraid to be

4067.079 --> 4071.799
associated with it even though he might

4068.92 --> 4075.2000000000003
know it's true it's just

4071.799 --> 4076.96
that he's not really going in getting

4075.2 --> 4078.5989999999997
into it he's not like being a flat

4076.96 --> 4081.68
earther or

4078.599 --> 4084.559
anything but he

4081.68 --> 4087.2
doesn't like ban or silence flat

4084.559 --> 4087.2000000000003
earthers at

4089.0 --> 4096.4
all doesn't avoid

4091.64 --> 4096.4
them so that's a that's a good

4102.839 --> 4108.08
thing

4104.92 --> 4108.08
oh really he said it this

4109.279 --> 4115.4400000000005
flat oh

4111.799 --> 4115.44
wow I didn't know

4118.239 --> 4124.599999999999
that

4120.56 --> 4124.6
huh that's why he's super

4132.799 --> 4137.719
pissed

4135.719 --> 4140.08
because he found out that that was all

4137.719 --> 4143.679
fake you

4140.08 --> 4147.799
mean why would you because then bunch of

4143.679 --> 4151.1990000000005
numpty [ __ ] like you Aries 106 could

4147.799 --> 4153.679
be worse though and and there's other

4151.199 --> 4156.04
the troll ass wipes that continually

4153.679 --> 4158.279
this have no life because they then they

4156.04 --> 4161.2789999999995
all get on his

4158.279 --> 4163.839000000001
ass

4161.279 --> 4165.56
yeah I mean the Earth might be flat but

4163.839 --> 4168.0
if you're going to openly talk about it

4165.56 --> 4172.04
you get swarmed by parasites and he's

4168.0 --> 4174.96
already got parasites all over the place

4172.04 --> 4174.96
is trying to get rid

4186.839 --> 4192.5599999999995
of right and hey as long as he knows it

4189.92 --> 4195.64
that's good like as long as he doesn't

4192.56 --> 4196.84
like play in because if he knows it that

4195.64 --> 4198.52
will help

4196.84 --> 4202.04
him

4198.52 --> 4205.1990000000005
avoid brother Brotherhood of grifters

4202.04 --> 4208.76
which are all about the globe and outer

4205.199 --> 4212.0
space talk that's brother of gri

4208.76 --> 4215.52
Brotherhood of grifter is all about that

4212.0 --> 4217.96
right liberal Imperium not so much but

4215.52 --> 4221.8
the brother of grifters are all about

4217.96 --> 4221.8
that freaking globe and going to the

4222.64 --> 4225.64
Stars

4230.76 --> 4235.8
so if he F I don't know when he figured

4233.159 --> 4237.48
out that the Earth is flat maybe he did

4235.8 --> 4240.64
a long time ago maybe he did pretty

4237.48 --> 4243.239
recently but yeah if you

4240.64 --> 4245.159000000001
see if you know that then you're going

4243.239 --> 4246.759999999999
to see like similar then he's going to

4245.159 --> 4249.04
see similar things to like what I'm

4246.76 --> 4249.04
looking

4249.679 --> 4255.76
at you're going to recognize those

4251.96 --> 4262.08
patterns that they like to use the globe

4255.76 --> 4262.08
stuff as a popular talking point to for

4262.44 --> 4268.199
entertainment like it draws in certain

4265.8 --> 4268.1990000000005
type of

4274.44 --> 4280.719
people that good [ __ ] Carlson pretends

4278.04 --> 4282.0
to know about F oh but they all heard

4280.719 --> 4285.56
about

4282.0 --> 4288.44
it ter it don't you know trau mentioned

4285.56 --> 4290.400000000001
like they all have heard about it oh the

4288.44 --> 4292.719
phenomenon oh there are these flat

4290.4 --> 4297.759999999999
earthers out there yeah they've all

4292.719 --> 4297.76
heard about it they will all like say

4297.88 --> 4302.719
it but none of them actually give a

4305.0 --> 4311.719
[ __ ] they all want to just like oh get

4307.92 --> 4314.679
away from me like just you're just dumb

4311.719 --> 4316.719
and crazy and like oh so a new cultural

4314.679 --> 4318.719
thing I mean they're probably in their

4316.719 --> 4321.4
minds just comparing it to like well

4318.719 --> 4324.679
there's like trans kids with surgery and

4321.4 --> 4327.839999999999
all that so if you compare flat earthers

4324.679 --> 4330.84
to that it's not that

4327.84 --> 4333.679
crazy and we accept that

4330.84 --> 4337.2390000000005
so but they don't want it they don't

4333.679 --> 4337.2390000000005
want the flat earthers not

4342.48 --> 4345.48
really

4372.88 --> 4377.92
I haven't heard heard that

4375.04 --> 4381.96
teret X Jones said he actually wanted to

4377.92 --> 4384.4400000000005
learn about it absolute

4381.96 --> 4386.6
[ __ ] maybe he thinks he needs to

4384.44 --> 4389.839999999999
learn he can't do

4386.6 --> 4391.2390000000005
it he is too like Alex Jan is like a

4389.84 --> 4395.4400000000005
genuine

4391.239 --> 4398.32
bolard like he can't do

4395.44 --> 4401.04
it you might have been like subjected to

4398.32 --> 4404.799999999999
some weird conditioning or something

4401.04 --> 4409.159
just can't do it he is like he is the

4404.8 --> 4409.159000000001
globe he even looks like a freaking

4425.28 --> 4431.159
Globe yeah but ter have you ever

4428.52 --> 4433.400000000001
considered that maybe it is that he says

4431.159 --> 4435.839999999999
it's the first time he ever heard it

4433.4 --> 4438.28
because it is the first time he's ever

4435.84 --> 4441.32
heard it every single time that

4438.28 --> 4443.759999999999
happens cuz he can't handle it so he's

4441.32 --> 4446.5599999999995
literally like all that information you

4443.76 --> 4450.0
get when you're like a

4446.56 --> 4452.1990000000005
glober it's just erased it's like you

4450.0 --> 4454.92
can't remember it there's nothing there

4452.199 --> 4456.759999999999
in your head where you can let it settle

4454.92 --> 4460.12
and have a

4456.76 --> 4462.0
place it's just it just all collapses

4460.12 --> 4463.679
and you forget about it so it's like

4462.0 --> 4466.88
every time you hear it's like the first

4463.679 --> 4470.4800000000005
time I used to have

4466.88 --> 4472.400000000001
that before 2015 remember I was

4470.48 --> 4474.879999999999
confronted with flatter so many times

4472.4 --> 4478.04
and then I would really get into it

4474.88 --> 4480.12
actually for a little bit because I

4478.04 --> 4483.5199999999995
would just be so easy to accept like oh

4480.12 --> 4486.08
oh the Earth's flat oh oh okay let me

4483.52 --> 4487.280000000001
let me hear about it and then I would

4486.08 --> 4491.48
understand

4487.28 --> 4494.32
it and be like wow this is amazing and

4491.48 --> 4498.12
then I just forget about it

4494.32 --> 4502.5199999999995
to completely forget that that happened

4498.12 --> 4502.5199999999995
like the next day I wouldn't

4503.12 --> 4509.8
remember but then if somebody else would

4505.96 --> 4514.199
bring it up at some other point in time

4509.8 --> 4516.76
I would like oh oh yeah sort of maybe a

4514.199 --> 4520.32
little bit of headache like oh yeah I

4516.76 --> 4523.280000000001
remember something about it was kind of

4520.32 --> 4525.159
interesting but it was just like never

4523.28 --> 4526.719
it would compartmentalize in my mind

4525.159 --> 4528.36
basically it's like this Flat Earth

4526.719 --> 4532.199
knowledge would be there it just

4528.36 --> 4534.96
wouldn't fit it wouldn't stay it's just

4532.199 --> 4537.799999999999
something like oh yeah like something

4534.96 --> 4540.56
that's there and then you can't really

4537.8 --> 4543.639
place it you can't really

4540.56 --> 4545.4800000000005
accept that the ball isn't real yet but

4543.639 --> 4546.719
you understand something about how the

4545.48 --> 4549.44
Earth is

4546.719 --> 4550.52
flat right so it stays compartmentalized

4549.44 --> 4554.36
and it

4550.52 --> 4558.400000000001
can't merge with the Earth being a globe

4554.36 --> 4560.719
so then it just it just snaps out of it

4558.4 --> 4562.96
you forget about it just goes away again

4560.719 --> 4564.28
it's like Amnesia you forget about it

4562.96 --> 4566.8
like that

4564.28 --> 4570.5599999999995
happened that's what it does so I'm not

4566.8 --> 4572.28
surprised at all that Alex Jones said it

4570.56 --> 4575.0
like oh that's the first time I've ever

4572.28 --> 4577.32
heard it because he would have literally

4575.0 --> 4581.56
forgotten cuz that's what happens when

4577.32 --> 4581.5599999999995
you're a genuine ballb believing

4582.12 --> 4588.239
Ballard you've heard all those arguments

4585.48 --> 4591.5199999999995
maybe if you hang around flat earthers

4588.239 --> 4596.32
like hundreds of times but they don't

4591.52 --> 4599.120000000001
fit they just slide off like you can't

4596.32 --> 4602.239
it can't stick long enough for you to

4599.12 --> 4604.639
actually create a bigger picture with

4602.239 --> 4609.718999999999
it that's what's probably happening with

4604.639 --> 4609.719
him just slips off just just doesn't

4612.08 --> 4615.08
fit

4627.96 --> 4632.199
yeah that's a good point AR 106

4642.0 --> 4645.0
yes

4651.639 --> 4656.4400000000005
maybe teret that's going to be part of

4655.199 --> 4659.44
it

4656.44 --> 4661.04
maybe but I do think that the Alex is

4659.44 --> 4666.799999999999
just genuinely

4661.04 --> 4666.8
barded you just can't can can't make it

4667.199 --> 4673.5599999999995
fit like he can't let go of that he

4670.719 --> 4675.4800000000005
thinks it's ridiculous he can't do it he

4673.56 --> 4678.719
can't let go of

4675.48 --> 4681.36
that that judgment like it's ridiculous

4678.719 --> 4683.679
yeah it it makes sense but it's

4681.36 --> 4686.28
ridiculous he can't do

4683.679 --> 4689.159
it he can't stop ridicul it's like it's

4686.28 --> 4691.12
so conditioned in there like in the past

4689.159 --> 4693.44
he might have like even like as a kid

4691.12 --> 4696.44
like really bullied flat earthers or

4693.44 --> 4699.759999999999
something like really

4696.44 --> 4704.36
fanatically maybe that's it so it just

4699.76 --> 4706.96
can't make it fit can't take it serious

4704.36 --> 4706.96
he can't do

4723.84 --> 4728.84
it Bravo was super angry at Alex J

4731.32 --> 4735.239
really you mean super

4738.32 --> 4743.28
disappointed just actually angry I can't

4741.12 --> 4746.159
imagine that but frustrated and

4743.28 --> 4746.159
disappointed I

4761.84 --> 4764.84
can

4772.28 --> 4776.28
they can't get it yeah fibr but it's not

4774.4 --> 4779.44
because they don't understand it's just

4776.28 --> 4782.08
they can't accept it they don't

4779.44 --> 4784.159
understand they just don't understand

4782.08 --> 4787.159
right it's not like they can't

4784.159 --> 4789.5599999999995
comprehend they just can't accept

4787.159 --> 4791.839999999999
it and the funny thing is that

4789.56 --> 4793.719
understand basically means the same

4791.84 --> 4796.159000000001
thing

4793.719 --> 4798.56
that's why

4796.159 --> 4799.92
sometimes it's not about whether they

4798.56 --> 4804.120000000001
understand it it's whether they

4799.92 --> 4806.159
understand it or to make it more easily

4804.12 --> 4808.199
comprehensible it's not about whether

4806.159 --> 4811.239
they can comprehend it it's better

4808.199 --> 4811.239
whether they can accept

4821.76 --> 4824.76
it

4831.08 --> 4835.159
there ingredients okay teret

4838.12 --> 4846.08
sure hard they've been tricked so they

4841.8 --> 4850.719
deny no I don't think it is that at

4846.08 --> 4850.719
all it's not about being tricked it's

4851.719 --> 4857.199
about

4854.04 --> 4860.32
you just can't accept it you're just so

4857.199 --> 4864.44
used to seeing it like that to have that

4860.32 --> 4867.92
lock on your mind to see it like that

4864.44 --> 4870.719
and to rearrange it it's like it it

4867.92 --> 4872.84
rearranges the energy Pathways that go

4870.719 --> 4875.88
through your body in a way and it's

4872.84 --> 4879.04
really uncomfortable because it

4875.88 --> 4881.639
like if you admit it it literally

4879.04 --> 4884.639
changes you as a

4881.639 --> 4884.639
person

4885.48 --> 4894.159
and then takes you away from that very

4888.719 --> 4894.159
familiar and trusted way of that you

4897.28 --> 4903.36
work and people don't like to change

4900.28 --> 4905.96
away from what they're used to be like

4903.36 --> 4909.839999999999
what they're used

4905.96 --> 4909.84
to what they're counting

4911.639 --> 4914.639
on

4924.159 --> 4928.638999999999
curvature evidence and deniable flatness

4927.08 --> 4931.88
oh yeah he would have definitely

4928.639 --> 4934.08
respected the Black Swan argument and he

4931.88 --> 4936.4400000000005
would absolutely know about gas pressure

4934.08 --> 4936.44

like he would absolutely recognize

4961.44 --> 4964.44
that

4966.679 --> 4971.8
so yeah if Dr Shiva has set out to

4970.199 --> 4974.159
figure it out then he would have figured

4971.8 --> 4978.92
it out pretty quick

4974.159 --> 4978.92

people don't actually want to know they

side with the narrative in an eloquent

5426.6 --> 5431.1990000000005
enough way that is

5428.8 --> 5435.28

yes space is fake and

5474.96 --> 5481.199
gay and it's it's weird

5478.56 --> 5483.639
too because it is actually a thing you

5481.199 --> 5486.759999999999
know

5483.639 --> 5489.52
that they're trying to pull the gays in

space like

5489.52 --> 5494.159000000001

5491.44 --> 5497.36
trickery like they're actively trying to

5494.159 --> 5497.36
lure gay people

5498.199 --> 5503.5199999999995
in which is just

5501.119 --> 5507.5599999999995
crazy when you think about

5503.52 --> 5507.56
it it makes it even

The Gaze from

5537.239 --> 5540.08
appeal to

5540.679 --> 5549.119
gay say like oh but

5544.239 --> 5549.119
you they want the gays to care about

5551.4 --> 5558.599999999999
it right next before you know it like

5555.199 --> 5562.0
they want sjws and all that to start

5558.6 --> 5565.04
complaining about how there's not enough

5562.0 --> 5567.4
gay people on the the space station or

5565.04 --> 5570.119
something I'm not joking

5567.4 --> 5572.08
dude but you think that sounds

5570.119 --> 5575.08
ridiculous well you should should know

5572.08 --> 5577.92
by now that it sounds exactly ridiculous

5575.08 --> 5577.92

real

5608.86 --> 5611.929999999999
[Music]

5620.32 --> 5623.4
that's ridiculous I

5624.719 --> 5630.36
know and I've I've been thinking about

5627.28 --> 5632.199
like why why would they push it so far

5630.36 --> 5636.08
and I really think that

5632.199 --> 5639.32
at the root of it this whole

5636.08 --> 5642.76
hyperness and its connection with

5639.32 --> 5642.759999999999
Satanism which it

5642.88 --> 5652.32
is are very PR gay the satanic Club

5649.199 --> 5653.239
fairy and it really is because gays

5652.32 --> 5658.08
don't

5653.239 --> 5658.08
procreate and usually don't want

5659.159 --> 5665.159
that selfishness too and not procreation

5663.159 --> 5668.719
so if you have like everybody believes

5665.159 --> 5670.36
in space but like Eugenics is still a

5668.719 --> 5672.92
thing and people are still like

5670.36 --> 5674.839999999999
anti-human and afraid that there be too

5672.92 --> 5677.679
much population well they if they

5674.84 --> 5679.96
believe in space on top of that which is

5677.679 --> 5683.679
bizarre but it happens there's

5679.96 --> 5683.679
billionaires that believe in space

5684.159 --> 5691.879999999999
probably yes really it's crazy but it's

5687.6 --> 5694.08
probably true well they wouldn't want

5691.88 --> 5697.04
the the

5694.08 --> 5700.0
fertile people that are with living with

5697.04 --> 5703.56
God properly they wouldn't want them to

5700.0 --> 5706.48
go out and escape and baby basically

5703.56 --> 5708.04
start procreating again somewhere else

5706.48 --> 5711.959999999999
on some other

5708.04 --> 5715.44
planet no so they would want the gays to

5711.96 --> 5717.4
go to space right cuz gays don't

5715.44 --> 5720.719
procreate and so if you have all the

5717.4 --> 5723.4
astronauts and spaceship operators be

5720.719 --> 5723.4
gays

5724.0 --> 5730.4
well then they can't just secretly go

5726.88 --> 5730.400000000001
off and start a new Colony

5736.32 --> 5741.04
somewhere that you didn't think of that

5738.84 --> 5741.04
did

5742.76 --> 5750.96
you clutch te it logical

5869.119 --> 5874.4
sorry there's a bridge on on the moon I

5871.84 --> 5874.400000000001
can sell

5875.56 --> 5880.84
you I have a train

5878.239 --> 5883.08

5913.92 --> 5918.76

5917.0 --> 5922.08
about if you're going to have a train

5918.76 --> 5925.2390000000005
station on the moon is can it function

5922.08 --> 5927.599
with the low air pressure very very low

5925.239 --> 5930.48
air pressure and is there going to be

5927.599 --> 5933.679
viable technology to basically collect

5930.48 --> 5936.5199999999995
the their and pressurize the very thin

5933.679 --> 5939.8
air from the earth atmosphere that

5936.52 --> 5942.8
surrounds the moon right like how much

5939.8 --> 5944.96
energy would it take to have like a a

5942.8 --> 5948.92
motor pump system that could

5944.96 --> 5952.92
just suck off the lower air pressure

5948.92 --> 5956.2390000000005
that's is around in the moon and create

5952.92 --> 5960.04
pre properly pressurized atmosphere like

5956.239 --> 5963.04
in glass systems and all that like in

5960.04 --> 5963.04
tanks

5965.32 --> 5972.799999999999
right because I'm pretty sure you could

5968.44 --> 5976.239
just use very easy vacuum

5972.8 --> 5979.320000000001
systems to have like a vacuum propelled

5976.239 --> 5981.08
train tube on the moon and I'm probably

5979.32 --> 5984.4
not the first one to ever bring that up

5981.08 --> 5988.32
I mean a lot of sci-fi about bases on

5984.4 --> 5988.32
the moon or whatever have that sort of

5990.04 --> 5993.04
thing

5995.8 --> 5999.360000000001
the whole point of course about if

5997.32 --> 6001.84
you're going to have mass transport on

5999.36 --> 6004.32
the moon is like what the hell is it

6001.84 --> 6006.8
necessary for what are you going to

6004.32 --> 6008.36
transport from one facility to another

6006.8 --> 6012.28
for what what what are you going to be

6008.36 --> 6014.5199999999995
doing there right only if multiple

6012.28 --> 6018.28
locations have

6014.52 --> 6022.2390000000005
interest for activity human activity

6018.28 --> 6025.5199999999995
only then becomes a train station Act

6022.239 --> 6028.04
a viable project to

6025.52 --> 6029.84
pursue and yes I'm still talking about

6028.04 --> 6032.56
on the

6029.84 --> 6038.159000000001
moon if you believe that's actually a

6032.56 --> 6038.159000000001
place you can visit and stand on and do

6042.04 --> 6046.96

government of

6049.92 --> 6052.92
course

6079.48 --> 6084.4
really teret that's hilar is somebody

6081.88 --> 6089.08
actually managed to sell the Eiffel

6084.4 --> 6089.08
Tower twice that's

6090.679 --> 6097.2390000000005
amazing and who said the government owns

6093.159 --> 6098.44
the moon well they do they're selling it

6097.239 --> 6101.159
to you aren't

6098.44 --> 6104.0
they well if they're selling it to you

6101.159 --> 6106.759999999999
that means they are saying that they own

6104.0 --> 6111.08
it that's how that works when you sell

6106.76 --> 6113.599
something it's it's it includes a DE

6111.08 --> 6116.719
ation for default of owning it otherwise

6113.599 --> 6116.719
how the hell are you going to sell

6117.36 --> 6123.679
it they sell stallers as well that's

6120.32 --> 6123.679
going to be a bit more difficult

but

6142.65 --> 6145.688999999999
[Music]

6164.96 --> 6169.76

belongs to the

6169.76 --> 6174.719
government

what you want it to belong to the United

6178.4 --> 6185.04
teret dude you could just say well screw

6181.36 --> 6189.28
it all I'm just going to go there on my

6185.04 --> 6193.159
own I'm going to just claim it just put

6189.28 --> 6195.599
my terit 306 flag in the ground and like

6193.159 --> 6198.92
I am now The Sovereign of the

moon but yeah then what like who's going

6198.92 --> 6205.4400000000005
to help you out when things go wrong you

6202.32 --> 6207.48
know by making letting government take

6205.44 --> 6209.32
the claim that they means that they also

6207.48 --> 6213.44
take the responsibility so that if

6209.32 --> 6214.88
something goes wrong on it by a citizen

6213.44 --> 6218.879999999999
that they will have to take

6214.88 --> 6218.88
responsibility officially

6223.199 --> 6228.28
see whether it's real or not is really

6226.04 --> 6230.76
not really

6228.28 --> 6232.4
relevant it's just about whether who's

6230.76 --> 6235.4400000000005
going to take responsibility for

6232.4 --> 6235.44
whatever seems to

6256.8 --> 6262.599
happen so the idiots who are buying it

6289.56 --> 6292.56
that

6298.8 --> 6304.04
I can get you a piece of

6301.239 --> 6306.638999999999
IO I mean you're going to have to like

6304.04 --> 6312.44
build the the moon or the base there and

6306.639 --> 6312.4400000000005
all that but I can get get you that

6392.36 --> 6398.96
you need to research this

6395.639 --> 6398.96
really okay

6409.4 --> 6412.4
teret

6421.84 --> 6426.88
all right but I mean historically on

6424.04 --> 6430.92
Earth our land is

6426.88 --> 6433.52
claimed it's it's just passed on it's

6430.92 --> 6436.96
like who lives

6433.52 --> 6436.96
there they own

6437.84 --> 6445.719
it like land is

6441.32 --> 6447.96
like kept by families that's how it used

6445.719 --> 6447.96
to

6449.28 --> 6454.5599999999995
be and then like during the colonization

6452.159 --> 6458.5199999999995
is really the first time that there was

6454.56 --> 6461.4400000000005
such a thing as like oh let's go out and

6458.52 --> 6464.8
claim the land with flags I

6461.44 --> 6467.44
mean that's that's relatively new it's

6464.8 --> 6469.4400000000005
like a a corporate Endeavor you have to

6467.44 --> 6472.919999999999
see it as like that like it's a

6469.44 --> 6476.08
colonization based corporate Endeavor to

6472.92 --> 6478.32
just let people go out and claim a piece

6476.08 --> 6478.32
of

6480.159 --> 6486.879999999999
land that that's not normal that's not

6484.599 --> 6490.159000000001
like how they did it in ancient times I

6486.88 --> 6493.4800000000005
can tell you that it's just like no the

6490.159 --> 6497.33
the ones that live there the families

6493.48 --> 6499.239
that have lived there own

6497.33 --> 6502.239
[Music]

6499.239 --> 6502.239
it

6515.639 --> 6519.96
the cies

6517.4 --> 6522.92
did buying land on the

6519.96 --> 6525.76
moon now they're just going with some

6522.92 --> 6529.4
Ledger I mean those ledgers like how

6525.76 --> 6532.1990000000005
they technically work I think is like

6529.4 --> 6534.879999999999
it's like a what if statement it's like

6532.199 --> 6537.28
a legend that just says like if the moon

6534.88 --> 6539.119
is like if there is ever going to be

6537.28 --> 6543.28
anything that happens

6539.119 --> 6545.598999999999
there and it's real place then you own

6543.28 --> 6548.28
this part of that

6545.599 --> 6550.159000000001
place but I mean just because you have

6548.28 --> 6553.36
that doesn't mean

6550.159 --> 6555.719
that yeah you you you can't afford to

6553.36 --> 6560.0
just go there I mean it's just like in

6555.719 --> 6562.52
case it's real you own it that's kind of

6560.0 --> 6562.52
what it

6565.92 --> 6571.4400000000005
is and so it's just all about like do

6569.159 --> 6574.638999999999
you actually believe space is real and

6571.44 --> 6578.08
the Moon is a real place cuz if you do

6574.639 --> 6581.1990000000005
well then by that standard you have that

6578.08 --> 6583.84
legal claim kind of

6581.199 --> 6586.119
thing sort of

6583.84 --> 6588.719
although you can do that now because

6586.119 --> 6592.119
there's no regulating body about

6588.719 --> 6592.119
ownership of the Moon

6593.679 --> 6599.08
I can't believe I just said that but

6595.4 --> 6602.839999999999
yeah that's what it is that there's

6599.08 --> 6607.08
no there's no legal body

6602.84 --> 6612.639
that's that like determines on

6607.08 --> 6615.8
how ownership of the moon or parts of it

6612.639 --> 6617.88
work so it's kind of up for grab still

6615.8 --> 6621.719
because well doesn't really exist so

6617.88 --> 6624.679
it's just like a fantasy game

6621.719 --> 6627.76
but yeah people do pay money for

6624.679 --> 6629.84
it based on the Assumption on their

6627.76 --> 6633.639
belief that the Moon is a real place

6629.84 --> 6636.84
that you can be on and have that it has

6633.639 --> 6639.06
land I mean I'd love Mining rights to

6636.84 --> 6641.04
the Moon that would be

6639.06 --> 6643.4800000000005
[Music]

6641.04 --> 6645.639
awesome who knows what kind of stuff you

6643.48 --> 6648.32
can find on there I mean they found

6645.639 --> 6652.04
petrified wood on there so who knows

6648.32 --> 6652.04
what else you can find you know

6653.4 --> 6660.159
like I'm really wondering like where's

6655.639 --> 6660.159000000001
the water and how pure a water is

6666.079 --> 6672.079
it cuz Hey if if you want any viable

6669.719 --> 6676.599
long-term space exploration you're going

6672.079 --> 6678.92
to have to have a tanking station on the

6676.599 --> 6680.719
moon where you can basically tank

6678.92 --> 6682.599
hydrogen fuel

6680.719 --> 6684.679
which is much easier on the moon if

6682.599 --> 6687.0
there's water there you can do that and

6684.679 --> 6688.119
then you don't have to carry all that

6687.0 --> 6690.719
fuel

6688.119 --> 6693.239
material as you try to escape the

6690.719 --> 6696.2390000000005
gravity on Earth right cuz once you're

6693.239 --> 6699.598999999999
at the moon it's much easier the weight

6696.239 --> 6702.839999999999
is less so it's much easier to just tank

6699.599 --> 6704.84
up there and then move on at much

6702.84 --> 6708.52
further

6704.84 --> 6712.4400000000005
distances right without having to waste

6708.52 --> 6712.4400000000005
all that fuel just getting of the

6715.28 --> 6721.159
earth see and that's a business plan on

6718.28 --> 6723.759999999999
how to sell a part of the Moon that's

6721.159 --> 6723.759999999999
how you do

6725.639 --> 6731.719
that that's how you get somebody really

6728.679 --> 6734.119
interested that's how I get myself

6731.719 --> 6735.76
interested the only thing I regret is

6734.119 --> 6738.079
that it's not

6735.76 --> 6741.88
real because if it were real that would

6738.079 --> 6741.88
be damn awesome

6768.84 --> 6771.84
h

6787.199 --> 6792.119
I just kind of hope that one day they

6789.0 --> 6796.159
will make the

6792.119 --> 6799.04
uh the rocket Arbiter

6796.159 --> 6801.28
simulator I mean it's a crazy project

6799.04 --> 6804.04
though

6801.28 --> 6807.599
where you can have like total perfect

6804.04 --> 6811.56
freef fall for like 10

6807.599 --> 6811.56
minutes and it would be like

6812.04 --> 6817.56
seamless so that you like had a real

6815.32 --> 6819.599
suspension of this belief that you are

6817.56 --> 6821.159000000001
actually in space wouldn't that be

6819.599 --> 6824.84
absolutely

6821.159 --> 6827.719
amazing and not like the the weird wonky

6824.84 --> 6830.28
vomit comat experience which is like the

6827.719 --> 6833.119
closest you can get now but it's still

6830.28 --> 6835.199
got to be shaky and like oh [ __ ] bang

6833.119 --> 6837.839999999999
you go against the wall right well how

6835.199 --> 6840.5199999999995
about it being so perfect that you

6837.84 --> 6843.4400000000005
literally could just like stare at a

6840.52 --> 6845.96
droplet hanging there perfectly still

6843.44 --> 6851.079
for like 10 minutes I

6845.96 --> 6853.96
mean that's Zerg not some weird shaky

6851.079 --> 6856.04
[ __ ] in an airplane that only last for

6853.96 --> 6858.679
like 2 minutes or

6856.04 --> 6861.4
something

6858.679 --> 6863.56
right I'm really kind of like hoping

6861.4 --> 6865.719
that at some point that that project

6863.56 --> 6871.119000000001
would be

6865.719 --> 6873.2390000000005
done so we can have a proper space

6871.119 --> 6875.799999999999
experience and not just a bunch of

6873.239 --> 6878.598999999999
horeshit talk like

6875.8 --> 6880.92
usual like people want to actually

6878.599 --> 6883.400000000001
experience space guys they don't want to

6880.92 --> 6885.1990000000005
just have the freaking CGI and a lot of

6883.4 --> 6889.079
talk about they want to feel it they

6885.199 --> 6892.32
want to actually have that feeling where

6889.079 --> 6895.5599999999995
physically like w it's whoa It's space

6892.32 --> 6898.84
they want to feel it you can make it

6895.56 --> 6903.4400000000005
happen it's really [ __ ] expensive but

6898.84 --> 6906.079
it can be done and that like

6903.44 --> 6909.5199999999995
that's it would be like

6906.079 --> 6912.239
a yeah a

6909.52 --> 6917.88
Wonder of modern

6912.239 --> 6917.879999999999
civilization an actual zerog G space

6918.599 --> 6921.599
emulator

6921.92 --> 6926.84
I got it all in my head and I had an

6924.0 --> 6929.599
episode about this like months

6926.84 --> 6930.8
ago or like maybe a year ago I don't

6929.599 --> 6934.0
know when it

6930.8 --> 6936.360000000001
was but I still like it would be really

6934.0 --> 6940.4
cool if one day that could be like

6936.36 --> 6944.239
done but I mean it's going to be very

6940.4 --> 6945.598999999999
costly like digging tunnels through

6944.239 --> 6948.839999999999
mountains

6945.599 --> 6953.4800000000005
diagonally with extreme Precision that's

6948.84 --> 6953.4800000000005
not going to be cheap I can tell you

6954.28 --> 6959.759999999999
that have you ever

6956.719 --> 6962.56
seen Pilots Fall unconscious due to zero

6959.76 --> 6965.04
G force in the when plane is flipped

6962.56 --> 6968.280000000001
yeah there's all kinds of dangers right

6965.04 --> 6971.079
that's why it shouldn't be airplane

6968.28 --> 6975.079
dependent right that's why it should be

6971.079 --> 6980.5599999999995
roller coaster system based sort of

6975.079 --> 6984.0
magl a magav roller coaster semi

6984.0 --> 6988.159

6985.92 --> 6990.719
rock around kind of thing in that

6988.159 --> 6994.719
direction like a virtual reality

6990.719 --> 6998.599
simulator remember those from the '90s

6994.719 --> 7001.8
that on a roller coaster sort of that's

6998.599 --> 7005.639
very careful magl and then with like

7001.8 --> 7008.4800000000005
perfect parabolic fall for an extreme

7005.639 --> 7011.32
length talking about

7008.48 --> 7013.799999999999
kilometers

7011.32 --> 7015.719
mult like a very long pathway that's

7013.8 --> 7018.92
basically like has to be a tunnel that's

7015.719 --> 7020.719
dug like through a mountain into the

7018.92 --> 7022.719
ground I mean you could do it fully in

7020.719 --> 7025.0
the ground but my God that would be so

7022.719 --> 7028.4
insanely deep that would have some like

7025.0 --> 7028.4
creepy pressures and all

7029.639 --> 7035.159000000001
that and then you can have like the

7031.92 --> 7038.4
perfect zero g experience like not no

7035.159 --> 7039.92
danger because it's like literally a

7038.4 --> 7042.159
pure

7039.92 --> 7044.84
high-tech machine

7042.159 --> 7047.719
operation with enormous fail save and

7044.84 --> 7047.719
precision and

7048.04 --> 7052.199
like so you could literally just be in

7051.199 --> 7055.04
that

7052.199 --> 7057.5599999999995
capsule and then when it first the

7055.04 --> 7059.119
rocket launch and you get the extra

7057.56 --> 7062.280000000001
pressure it's like oh you're in a rocket

7059.119 --> 7064.88
it's rocket launch it launches you up

7062.28 --> 7067.599
then eventually it's like oh we're in

7064.88 --> 7070.2390000000005
orbit or we're getting like in orbit and

7067.599 --> 7074.159000000001
then you literally feel feel the zero g

7070.239 --> 7074.159
it's like oh you're locked in because

7076.96 --> 7084.199
poof and you fall perfectly with a

7079.96 --> 7086.44
perfect pabor Arc for very long distance

7084.199 --> 7089.4
where it's perfectly seamless like

7086.44 --> 7092.079
there's nothing shaking no vibration no

7089.4 --> 7096.239
turbulence nothing it's

7092.079 --> 7100.759999999999
perfect like we can literally

7096.239 --> 7104.28
hear a screw hitting the wall

7100.76 --> 7105.88
cuz it's so perfectly still like that's

7104.28 --> 7109.84
what I'm looking

7105.88 --> 7109.84
for a machine like

7116.38 --> 7119.539
[Music]

7119.639 --> 7124.599
that that what the [ __ ] Z tappy that's

7125.52 --> 7131.92
lame no I'm looking for the perfect

7129.4 --> 7131.92
space

7132.719 --> 7137.8
experience you can have a like a

7135.04 --> 7140.599
advanced projector around you literally

7137.8 --> 7144.2390000000005
showing you oh the Earth is a globe oh

7140.599 --> 7148.76
we're in space Oh in the simulator while

7144.239 --> 7148.759999999999
you feel perfect seamless

7159.48 --> 7164.199
have this [ __ ] this the seamless perfect

7178.91 --> 7181.989
[Music]

7189.28 --> 7193.239
what a great

7190.44 --> 7195.119
idea I mean if the Earth were a globe

7193.239 --> 7196.919999999999
then a space elevator is like the most

7195.119 --> 7200.5199999999995
brilliant idea

7196.92 --> 7200.52
ever it really

7201.36 --> 7209.28
is right before like in 2014 I was like

7205.4 --> 7211.679
trying to design one of those on

7209.28 --> 7215.5199999999995
paper and then I figured out that the

7211.679 --> 7215.52
Earth was flat

7218.159 --> 7221.159
again

7228.28 --> 7232.239
yeah now a space elevator is never going

7230.079 --> 7236.5199999999995
to be actually a useful thing but you

7232.239 --> 7236.5199999999995
could make like a mega antenna

7237.4 --> 7242.48
though like can you imagine space

7240.639 --> 7245.400000000001
elevator but it's not really an elevator

7242.48 --> 7248.5199999999995
it's just a gigantic antenna that could

7245.4 --> 7250.598999999999
like reach everywhere in the world

7248.52 --> 7252.56
Absolut Maybe maybe even like beyond the

7250.599 --> 7256.84
North and South Pole or

7252.56 --> 7256.84
something right that would be

7262.719 --> 7268.0
interesting like it's not completely

7265.36 --> 7270.239
useless to like have super tall

7268.0 --> 7276.0
structures like

7270.239 --> 7276.0
that they can be used as radio

7278.04 --> 7280.96
antenna

7280.159 --> 7283.719
and

7280.96 --> 7285.719
broadcasting positions like technically

7283.719 --> 7289.44
it's like if you have a high enough

7285.719 --> 7292.4
Tower is almost like who needs

7289.44 --> 7294.879999999999
satellites or satoon I

7292.4 --> 7297.598999999999
mean although they'll still be cheaper

7294.88 --> 7301.04
but you could just have a system there

7297.599 --> 7301.04
that's just at this fixed

7301.199 --> 7307.159
place it's not going to run out although

7304.119 --> 7309.96
yeah how safe is that structure right

7307.159 --> 7312.5599999999995
like the higher it is the more

7309.96 --> 7312.56
risky it

7313.159 --> 7318.32
becomes especially if there's going to

7315.159 --> 7323.5599999999995
be something heavy at the

7318.32 --> 7323.5599999999995
top like the toor Babel no not

7337.96 --> 7340.96
really

7346.8 --> 7352.159000000001
right anyway I think I'm going to run

7348.4 --> 7352.159
out the show I've been doing it for two

7352.76 --> 7356.35
[Music]

7361.44 --> 7367.96
hours really hope to get some support

7364.119 --> 7370.96
guys I'm going to have a tough month

7367.96 --> 7370.96
again

7373.4 --> 7378.28
also I'm going to probably need it soon

7375.28 --> 7380.159
because well Nathan's has sent me a

7378.28 --> 7383.599
monitor

7380.159 --> 7386.079
apparently but it doesn't have a stand

7383.599 --> 7390.8
for it so I'm going to have to like buy

7386.079 --> 7390.799999999999
a stand alongside it

7395.159 --> 7401.32
unfortunately but I mean the monitor is

7397.36 --> 7401.32
going to be pretty cool though I

7409.56 --> 7417.159000000001
have right but I mean the best option

7413.88 --> 7419.4400000000005
the easiest quickest option is like 60

7417.159 --> 7422.4
and then I yeah then I can have like a

7419.44 --> 7424.558999999999
really good stand like way better than

7422.4 --> 7429.0
how having it now that I can actually

7424.559 --> 7431.079000000001
have it attached to the desk here and

7429.0 --> 7433.199
even make it like flexible and all that

7431.079 --> 7436.4
that that would be freaking

7433.199 --> 7438.598999999999
epic and really useful too like I could

7436.4 --> 7441.96
actually use

7438.599 --> 7445.84
that so I'm really hoping it's going to

7441.96 --> 7448.04
work out with the monitor shipping here

7445.84 --> 7449.88
they not going to leave it at some drop

7448.04 --> 7454.679
point because yeah I can't collect like

7449.88 --> 7457.52
a 8 kilogram monitor like on a bicycle

7454.679 --> 7457.52
like this not going to

7457.8 --> 7460.8
work

7478.04 --> 7484.4
anyway actively searching for the Dome I

7482.32 --> 7487.759999999999
don't think they ever imagined that they

7484.4 --> 7490.759999999999
would literally be able to reach that Z

7487.76 --> 7490.76
heavy

7507.32 --> 7514.96
by the way theoretically even uh the

7511.36 --> 7517.799999999999
closer you would get to the Dome the top

7514.96 --> 7521.4
whatever it is I think you'd probably

7517.8 --> 7521.400000000001
get severe lightning

7523.87 --> 7528.0
[Music]

7525.28 --> 7529.5199999999995
issues cuz it's like there's like two

7528.0 --> 7532.52
poles

7529.52 --> 7532.52
happening

7533.96 --> 7540.04
potentially so it would be enormously

7537.079 --> 7543.119
Hazard to just keep building like super

7540.04 --> 7543.119
high up like

7543.599 --> 7548.96
that they were trying to reach yeah sure

7546.44 --> 7552.44
they were trying that sa but I mean they

7548.96 --> 7552.44
could never actually make

7554.04 --> 7560.28
it cuz they'd get so many hazards they

7557.44 --> 7563.239
could never finish

7560.28 --> 7565.4
it that they probably get non-stop

7563.239 --> 7568.919999999999
lightning at like the last

7565.4 --> 7572.159
kilometer just nonstop just never stop

7568.92 --> 7572.159
lightning bolts never

7577.599 --> 7580.599
stop

7580.68 --> 7583.729
[Music]

7586.599 --> 7593.84
what the [ __ ] are you whining about dude

7588.92 --> 7593.84
zap tappy what the [ __ ] are you whining

7594.28 --> 7601.079
about no we have to

7597.4 --> 7603.4
build a freaking Tower of Babel to prove

7601.079 --> 7605.28
there's a dome according to Zep tappy

7603.4 --> 7607.558999999999
here like what the [ __ ] is wrong with

7605.28 --> 7607.559
you

7607.599 --> 7613.119000000001
man

7609.599 --> 7615.4800000000005
I don't have any interested in in

7613.119 --> 7618.48
proving where the flat top I don't think

7615.48 --> 7620.32
it's a dome is I don't have any

7618.48 --> 7621.839999999999
interested or vested interest in

7620.32 --> 7627.119
anything about

7621.84 --> 7629.2390000000005
that I don't need it to be at any point

7627.119 --> 7634.04
or prove that it is there because I'm

7629.239 --> 7636.638999999999
breathing and I trust in the laws of

7634.04 --> 7638.76
nature that tell me there has to be a

7636.639 --> 7641.400000000001
limitation to the available volume for

7638.76 --> 7644.0
the gas in order to have it be

7641.4 --> 7647.4
pressurized the way it

7644.0 --> 7651.8
is I don't know where I don't need to

7647.4 --> 7656.199
know where the Dome or Flat Top

7651.8 --> 7660.559
is all I need to know is that it is at

7656.199 --> 7662.719
some point there because there's a

7660.559 --> 7665.4800000000005
limitation there has to be otherwise

7662.719 --> 7667.28
there can't be any gas pressure divided

7665.48 --> 7670.718999999999
the way it

7667.28 --> 7670.719
is very very

7673.87 --> 7678.14
[Music]

7678.719 --> 7684.679
simple you could just go to where it

7681.719 --> 7684.679
touch what the

7685.599 --> 7692.0
[ __ ] but that's your claim there that

7688.719 --> 7694.679
that's your stupid ass Dome claim yeah I

7692.0 --> 7698.159
don't think it touches the

7694.679 --> 7701.52
Earth that's why I say flat top flat top

7698.159 --> 7704.5199999999995
that does not touch the

7701.52 --> 7704.52
Earth

7707.079 --> 7714.799999999999
anywhere it's just there cuz it's

7711.04 --> 7718.0
probably the end of available volume for

7714.8 --> 7718.0
material to exist

7726.559 --> 7734.96
in so it's open on the S side yeah it's

7731.4 --> 7739.159
looping it's a looping available space

7734.96 --> 7739.159
you know I see it like that Z

7757.32 --> 7760.32

7763.36 --> 7769.36
looping dead

7765.559 --> 7774.04

perfect straight line perfect

7774.04 --> 7779.4
straight yeah straight

7779.76 --> 7784.4800000000005
continual you move the straight line you

7782.48 --> 7787.32
end up in the same

7784.48 --> 7789.04

globe

7789.04 --> 7795.559
straight perfect straight dead reckoning

7791.8 --> 7798.0
straight you fire a laser enormously

7795.559 --> 7801.8
powerful enormously

7798.0 --> 7804.679
powerful and you watch as it shoot right

7801.8 --> 7804.679
past your

7805.079 --> 7811.079

7808.599 --> 7811.079

7822.92 --> 7827.119
[ __ ] Ballard [ __ ]

with yeah a straight line that means not

7831.28 --> 7837.0
a

7832.8 --> 7839.079000000001
globe yeah cuz that's a circle it's a

7837.0 --> 7840.559
vertical Circle you're talking about

7839.079 --> 7844.0
[ __ ]

7840.559 --> 7850.2390000000005
[ __ ] yeah I'm talking about a straight

7844.0 --> 7850.239
line not a circle a straight line

7864.119 --> 7869.719
dumbass yeah that's because I'm kicking

7866.52 --> 7874.84
him out zp tappy he's not supposed to be

7869.719 --> 7874.84
here he's unblocking himself

7877.159 --> 7880.159
somehow

7883.48 --> 7887.598999999999
yeah Earth is not a

7897.159 --> 7904.879999999999
ball yeah straight line equator a

7899.96 --> 7910.36
straight line that straight forward not

7904.88 --> 7918.119
curving not a circle around a

7910.36 --> 7918.119
globe or a circle on a disc a straight

7918.48 --> 7926.598999999999
line yeah we live in a spal

7923.92 --> 7930.76
Continuum there's a

7926.599 --> 7933.52
loop we live in a Continuum yeah there's

7930.76 --> 7935.559
a space it Loops in on itself it's the

7933.52 --> 7938.119000000001
available space it's a death straight

7935.559 --> 7940.400000000001
line you end up in the same place that

7938.119 --> 7945.639
that's what this place is that's this

7940.4 --> 7949.879999999999
realm it's a Continuum a realm a looping

7945.639 --> 7952.1990000000005
system and we don't know yet if it Loops

7949.88 --> 7955.159000000001
north to south it

7952.199 --> 7958.96
could it could also be that there's just

7955.159 --> 7963.4
a long stretch of land north and south

7958.96 --> 7967.04
much longer than the east to west loop

7963.4 --> 7970.04
is hey Elanor strand good to see

7967.04 --> 7970.04
you

7996.96 --> 8001.559
a

7999.159 --> 8004.719
right but uh yeah I'm going to run out

8001.559 --> 8009.04
the show I think I've uh made myself

8004.719 --> 8011.8
clear enough about the looping how that

8009.04 --> 8014.88
works and how that means there's a flat

8011.8 --> 8017.360000000001
top yeah there's no touchdown point if

8014.88 --> 8019.0
there's a loop north and

8017.36 --> 8023.239
south

8019.0 --> 8023.239
then there is no

8025.559 --> 8031.360000000001
touchdown it's just there

8029.199 --> 8035.199
it's part of the Continuum if there's a

8031.36 --> 8039.5199999999995
loop north and east north south east

8035.199 --> 8043.079
west then it's just stuck in

8039.52 --> 8047.320000000001
space like within the volumetric

8043.079 --> 8050.32
position and that could be most likely

8047.32 --> 8053.96
because there is simply no more space

8050.32 --> 8056.719
available for material to move

8053.96 --> 8060.079
into what I called

8056.719 --> 8064.559
non-space and so a flat top May simply

8060.079 --> 8067.159
be the end of available space and Beyond

8064.559 --> 8072.0
it would be

8067.159 --> 8075.239
non-space but non-space to the to

8072.0 --> 8078.639
us is like an

8075.239 --> 8081.04
infinitely strong impenetrable

8078.639 --> 8082.559
barrier which you would try to knock on

8081.04 --> 8085.079
it would

8082.559 --> 8088.04
be like the only thing you would be

8085.079 --> 8091.799999999999
hearing knocking is the sound of the the

8088.04 --> 8093.84
material tapping against it because is

8091.8 --> 8098.679
you're literally tapping on

8093.84 --> 8102.96
nothing on literal nothing like it's

8098.679 --> 8104.679
like volume but there's M no material

8102.96 --> 8108.76
can move into

8104.679 --> 8110.599
it this is like perfect emptiness where

8108.76 --> 8114.320000000001
material cannot

8110.599 --> 8116.360000000001
exist well but if there is such a place

8114.32 --> 8118.079
there nons space then yeah that would be

8116.36 --> 8120.91
like a barrier to us maybe even look

8118.079 --> 8123.239
like a mirror all

8120.91 --> 8125.5199999999995
[Music]

8123.239 --> 8127.638999999999
depends you might be able to look

8125.52 --> 8131.599
through it and see Darkness you might

8127.639 --> 8133.2390000000005
even be able to see or to shine light

8131.599 --> 8135.76
through

8133.239 --> 8137.638999999999
non-space and almost have the impression

8135.76 --> 8143.119000000001
like there's something Beyond but there

8137.639 --> 8147.4400000000005
literally cannot be anything material

8143.119 --> 8150.48
Beyond because material requires space

8147.44 --> 8154.36
to exist in and if there's no more

8150.48 --> 8157.799999999999
available space then material can't go

8154.36 --> 8157.799999999999
there and that's

8160.639 --> 8165.92
non-space

8162.28 --> 8168.599
right logical observations by the way so

8165.92 --> 8169.88
yeah just a quick summarization there

8168.599 --> 8173.400000000001
some of

8169.88 --> 8176.1990000000005
the effects

8173.4 --> 8178.679
conceptions about the looping Flat Earth

8176.199 --> 8181.839999999999
realm and what would be there how it

8178.679 --> 8184.84
would work cuz this is what I have been

8181.84 --> 8187.0
talking about a lot in the past working

8184.84 --> 8187.0
it

8187.28 --> 8191.84
out and I don't really like bring it to

8189.92 --> 8195.359
the table every day because I just get

8191.84 --> 8197.84
these disgusting [ __ ] trolls

8195.359 --> 8200.960000000001
continually trying to ruin

8197.84 --> 8204.479
it every single time I bring it

8200.96 --> 8206.678999999998
up they insist that I can't talk about

8204.479 --> 8208.358999999999
that without

8206.679 --> 8212.16
ridicule

8208.359 --> 8215.359
because I'm probably dead right I'm

8212.16 --> 8218.16
probably absolutely right way beyond

8215.359 --> 8222.439
what people should be

8218.16 --> 8225.0
capable of figuring out well I freaking

8222.439 --> 8225.0
figured it

8225.559 --> 8230.438999999998
out and that's why people really don't

8228.519 --> 8233.719000000001
like me some of

8230.439 --> 8236.599
them like how how are you figuring this

8233.719 --> 8239.598999999998
out how are you thinking this

8236.599 --> 8239.599
up

8243.88 --> 8249.279999999999
you're not supposed to figure things out

8247.04 --> 8251.04
like that especially if it's out of your

8249.28 --> 8253.2
reach you're not supposed to be able to

8251.04 --> 8256.399000000001
figure that out you're supposed to just

8253.2 --> 8258.240000000002
be mopy about it and complaining and

8256.399 --> 8259.8
whiny and go with the latest narrative

8258.24 --> 8261.92
and [ __ ] kill

8259.8 --> 8263.84
yourself that's what you're supposed to

8261.92 --> 8266.439
do you're not supposed to actually

8263.84 --> 8268.12
figure things out about what is beyond

8266.439 --> 8271.24
your reach

8268.12 --> 8272.319000000001
logically put it together gives you way

8271.24 --> 8275.559
too much

8272.319 --> 8279.24
Freedom you're not supposed to do that

8275.559 --> 8281.96
or win you're supposed to just shut the

8279.24 --> 8283.639
[ __ ] up be like everybody else and

8281.96 --> 8285.039999999999
[ __ ] kill yourself because there's

8283.639 --> 8287.358999999999
too many

8285.04 --> 8290.599
people

8287.359 --> 8294.880000000001
right that's what it is

8290.599 --> 8294.880000000001
right yeah I'm not playing that

8295.439 --> 8299.519
game not doing it

8299.84 --> 8303.439
I'm going to do what I like to do and

8302.319 --> 8308.84
figure

8303.439 --> 8312.04
out about how things are beyond my

8308.84 --> 8314.24
reach I've gotten quite well at it I'm

8312.04 --> 8316.04
very good at describing it and making

8314.24 --> 8319.039999999999
things

8316.04 --> 8321.28
understood and I know I'm going to turn

8319.04 --> 8324.2
out to be right about a whole lot of

8321.28 --> 8329.319000000001
things that I've con conceived

8324.2 --> 8331.84
of as I already am like about the

8329.319 --> 8335.279999999999
holographic nature of the celestial

8331.84 --> 8341.76
light something which was absolutely not

8335.28 --> 8345.319000000001
even considered in any way in 2015 16

8341.76 --> 8348.84
17 and then I literally like a crazy

8345.319 --> 8351.84
person started just saying that to

8348.84 --> 8354.8
people and guess what now people are

8351.84 --> 8358.2
figuring out that yeah they're not

8354.8 --> 8361.319
actually light emanating object in

8358.2 --> 8364.359
locations exactly and what is this and

8361.319 --> 8367.319
yeah yeah that wasn't normal guys that

8364.359 --> 8371.84
was [ __ ] rwin

8367.319 --> 8377.119999999999
exclusively not Owen Benjamin not David

8371.84 --> 8378.76
Weiss not Eric dubet not Eric Dollard

8377.12 --> 8382.359
none of those

8378.76 --> 8386.639000000001
[ __ ] out there ever have ever put

8382.359 --> 8390.0
together an official system like it's a

8386.639 --> 8394.199999999999
non-local hologram yeah nobody has done

8390.0 --> 8398.6
that that was me this one [ __ ] person

8394.2 --> 8401.399000000001
on Earth has done that me in

8398.6 --> 8404.92
2016 I brought that to the table that

8401.399 --> 8408.68
was me nobody else has done it and it's

8404.92 --> 8411.64
now getting accepted on higher level

8408.68 --> 8416.0
people are figuring out yeah it isn't a

8411.64 --> 8418.68
light in a specific position people know

8416.0 --> 8422.12
that now yeah I

8418.68 --> 8424.880000000001
exclusively Arwin brought that on

8422.12 --> 8427.240000000002
YouTube to the table in

8424.88 --> 8431.358999999999
2016 and

8427.24 --> 8434.199999999999
nobody else that was

8431.359 --> 8437.720000000001
me and some people are still trying to

8434.2 --> 8441.479000000001
ridicule it even though I'm right and

8437.72 --> 8443.358999999999
I'm the only one that even suggested

8441.479 --> 8446.358999999999
anything like this

8443.359 --> 8448.479000000001
yeah so good [ __ ] luck with your

8446.359 --> 8450.800000000001

sending emails and all that crap cuz you

8454.04 --> 8459.359
can't stop the

8455.6 --> 8463.16
signal I brought this idea to the world

8459.359 --> 8466.319
