least

80.88 --> 84.56
so far i hope it's gonna stay that way

82.72 --> 85.67999999999999
because i have to do my newspaper rounds

112.56 --> 121.84
truth hey it's not a dating stream

116.96 --> 121.83999999999999
uh matthew eastman hello

121.92 --> 127.52
brent m good servant tom parker

125.2 --> 129.28
stopping trafficking marista hat yeah

127.52 --> 132.48
good to see you

129.28 --> 134.64000000000001
sorry ma i'm a little late but yeah

132.48 --> 136.39999999999998
i went to bed really early yesterday

134.64 --> 138.55999999999997
like two o'clock which is really early

136.4 --> 142.4
for me now

138.56 --> 145.76
yeah i'm trying but despite that

142.4 --> 150.239
i uh i think i slept like

145.76 --> 150.239
11 hours it's pretty crazy

150.4 --> 156.0
because i got up at like past one yeah i

153.84 --> 157.68
slept a lot but i needed it and i had

156.0 --> 160.239
very extensive dreams so that was

157.68 --> 160.239
probably it

163.28 --> 169.28
i woke up at like between five and six

169.44 --> 172.8
and then went back to bed again and then

172.4 --> 176.239
just

172.8 --> 178.87900000000002
i had a very extensive dreams but it was

176.239 --> 180.4
more like a world construction dream so

178.879 --> 183.92
you can't really explain that

180.4 --> 186.4
it's just it's like what i do puzzling

183.92 --> 189.599
except with a virtual interface

186.4 --> 192.239
visual representation

189.599 --> 193.83999999999997
and yeah that just kept on going it was

192.239 --> 194.4
very interesting because i got the

193.84 --> 197.519
feeling

194.4 --> 200.08
i basically had like visual

197.519 --> 203.68
representation of very ethereal things

200.08 --> 205.68
so i it was almost like i was

203.68 --> 207.59900000000002
looking slightly into the future and

205.68 --> 210.56
trying to figure out

207.599 --> 210.56
what i was gonna do

210.799 --> 217.28
but yeah it's i can't

213.84 --> 217.28
i can only describe it

222.959 --> 228.799
yeah tom parker i saw the new video

225.76 --> 228.79899999999998
haven't watched it yet

229.28 --> 236.0
anyway i got green tea with me

232.799 --> 239.36
and another

236.0 --> 239.36
illuminati croissant

239.439 --> 241.84
i don't know

242.799 --> 246.72
i appreciated the one yesterday

247.12 --> 255.84
so i got another one ah hello m1 bear v3

256.959 --> 262.799
same weather in germany good to know to

260.079 --> 262.79900000000004
be expected

263.6 --> 269.84000000000003
uh right oh it's wednesday

270.72 --> 277.04
and well at least i made some notes but

275.04 --> 280.32
yeah it could be better

277.04 --> 281.68
but yesterday was a bit of a weird day

280.32 --> 283.759
for example because there was a

281.68 --> 286.16
wallbusters live

283.759 --> 288.16
because apparently there wasn't one

286.16 --> 291.84000000000003
tuesday

288.16 --> 293.759
uh no wait yesterday was tuesday what am

291.84 --> 295.59999999999997
i talking about

293.759 --> 298.32
what i thought it was wednesday

295.6 --> 301.52000000000004
yesterday what

298.32 --> 303.52
ah wow okay

301.52 --> 305.28
apparently it was quite off it was

303.52 --> 306.88
actually tuesday yesterday and anyway

305.28 --> 310.71999999999997
there was a ball buster's life and it

306.88 --> 313.6
was pretty good i was part of it

310.72 --> 315.52000000000004
and it's gonna be yeah like the a

313.6 --> 316.72
collection of baller fallacies it's

315.52 --> 320.0
basically

316.72 --> 322.88000000000005
the history of the fallacy pioneers

320.0 --> 324.96
[Music]

322.88 --> 328.56
and yeah it was fun to get over it again

324.96 --> 330.32
and to give my analysis of

328.56 --> 331.68
yeah where it's going and how things

330.32 --> 333.28
have changed

331.68 --> 335.68
it's a really good yeah that's what i

333.28 --> 338.32
like about ball busters it's very

335.68 --> 340.16
technical and concise it's like on the

338.32 --> 342.08
tip of the spear of the technical

340.16 --> 344.32000000000005
developments in a way

342.08 --> 346.479
everybody does act like that everybody

344.32 --> 348.56
puts in that level of effort and that is

346.479 --> 352.71999999999997
a really good moment

348.56 --> 355.36
for me too to do that

352.72 --> 356.88000000000005
so i feel very reinforced when i do it

355.36 --> 358.96000000000004
on there

356.88 --> 360.56
uh anyway it was that was a good ball

358.96 --> 362.96
buster show and the flat earth debates

360.56 --> 365.12
was also pretty decent

362.96 --> 366.79999999999995
although i did miss the entire after

365.12 --> 369.039
show i think

366.8 --> 372.16
because i went out for groceries then i

369.039 --> 374.96
do that more often you know

372.16 --> 377.199
i find a mo yeah usually when it's like

374.96 --> 379.35999999999996
when the ballers bite

377.199 --> 380.479
an ad or something is coming on then i

379.36 --> 383.6
know okay that's

380.479 --> 385.199
going to be at least a half hour or 45

383.6 --> 386.24
minutes and probably other abolishers

385.199 --> 390.479
step in

386.24 --> 392.479
so i'm i would be sitting

390.479 --> 396.15999999999997
just listening and probably laughing

392.479 --> 398.0
maybe some comments or a chat

396.16 --> 399.52000000000004
and that's the best that i would get out

398.0 --> 401.36
of it so then i'm just going to get

399.52 --> 403.44
groceries and hopefully when i get back

401.36 --> 404.96000000000004
it's kind of over or people will be sick

403.44 --> 406.96
of it and i'll

404.96 --> 410.0
be able to insert something again so

406.96 --> 412.31899999999996
that's my tactics

410.0 --> 413.52
and usually works out but sometimes when

412.319 --> 417.28000000000003
i come back

413.52 --> 418.96
it's just after the after show has ended

417.28 --> 421.11999999999995
that's too bad when it happens but oh

418.96 --> 423.75899999999996
well

421.12 --> 426.24
uh oh and benjamin was also alive pretty

423.759 --> 426.24
awesome

435.68 --> 442.08
trump was on tv wrestling

438.88 --> 443.759
what being an actor and all what do you

442.08 --> 448.0
mean

443.759 --> 449.91900000000004
only thing i've seen so far is just his

448.0 --> 451.599
after he came out of the hospital a

449.919 --> 456.15999999999997
little speech

451.599 --> 465.84
and he looked really good really radiant

456.16 --> 465.84000000000003
so that's it

476.84 --> 479.84
huh

482.4 --> 487.52
okay rasta that's that's a very funny

485.199 --> 487.52000000000004
dream

489.44 --> 493.84
it's flexing his muscles that's

504.84 --> 509.28
hilarious

506.319 --> 511.759
right yeah i think i saw that too george

509.28 --> 511.75899999999996
sanford

517.76 --> 522.24
yeah trump was getting involved in the

519.839 --> 525.44
tv

522.24 --> 525.44
situation a lot

526.56 --> 530.64
he really is a high profile guy he

528.8 --> 535.8389999999999
always was

530.64 --> 535.8389999999999
or always tried to be

544.959 --> 549.8389999999999
angela renee

552.64 --> 555.8389999999999
anyway uh yeah

556.8 --> 563.3599999999999
that was pretty much it uh i don't

558.959 --> 565.76
remember watching any movies or anything

563.36 --> 565.76
did i

566.8 --> 573.12
oh yeah now i just got stuck

569.92 --> 575.04
watching silly videos

573.12 --> 577.44
sometimes in that mood and then it just

575.04 --> 580.959
like two straight hours watch like a

577.44 --> 584.32
very specific type of silly video that

580.959 --> 586.0799999999999
it's just very distracting it's

584.32 --> 588.9590000000001
very distracting and that's why i like

586.08 --> 589.6800000000001
that it's basically so i don't have to

588.959 --> 592.399
actively

589.68 --> 592.7199999999999
think about lots of things all the time

592.399 --> 594.64
it's

592.72 --> 596.48
just a good distraction almost like a

594.64 --> 599.8389999999999
little puppet show

596.48 --> 603.04
it works on me so yep

599.839 --> 605.839
but no real movie watching or anything

603.04 --> 605.8389999999999
uh

609.519 --> 616.88
i given james true listen yet

613.6 --> 622.0
karen b invited him really

616.88 --> 625.04
no i haven't listened to him extensively

622.0 --> 628.16
i remember him being

625.04 --> 631.5999999999999
on owen benjamin

628.16 --> 634.64
and that there were some really weird

631.6 --> 637.36
things that he did and expressed

634.64 --> 638.24
and owen benjamin like kept track of him

637.36 --> 641.6800000000001
and he

638.24 --> 645.279
well he said that he pretty much

641.68 --> 648.4799999999999
went overboard immediately after

645.279 --> 651.519
they did that show and then

648.48 --> 654.48
he became the target of yeah

651.519 --> 655.68
of typical omen benjamin ridicule which

654.48 --> 659.2
is usually

655.68 --> 663.5999999999999
quite on target so

659.2 --> 663.6
yeah james true is a satanist yeah

665.2 --> 668.8000000000001
he's certainly not trying to be a

666.88 --> 673.12
christian

668.8 --> 673.12
recently so yeah

673.44 --> 678.6400000000001
i i wouldn't say satanist

676.56 --> 681.279
because i don't know enough details i

678.64 --> 684.8
don't even remember like what

681.279 --> 686.48
how far he went so

684.8 --> 688.079
you know it's been it's been a while but

686.48 --> 690.48
i haven't really watched any of his

688.079 --> 690.4799999999999
videos

696.64 --> 700.8389999999999
you say if you're listening to him you

699.04 --> 705.4399999999999
are worshiping him

700.839 --> 705.44
well look

705.519 --> 709.6
when somebody says that it depends

707.839 --> 710.1600000000001
really on the context of what they're

709.6 --> 713.44
trying to

710.16 --> 716.399
express yeah you could interpret that as

713.44 --> 718.72
haha i am giving myself up for worship

716.399 --> 720.32
and if you listen to me you worship me

718.72 --> 722.5600000000001
as a statement

720.32 --> 724.32
like a religious statement or you could

722.56 --> 727.1999999999999
say

724.32 --> 727.9200000000001
you could consider that he was trying to

727.2 --> 730.88
compare

727.92 --> 733.04
the act of worship with just paying

730.88 --> 733.68
attention to something or focusing on

733.04 --> 736.3199999999999
something

733.68 --> 736.8
because that's a way of thinking that i

736.32 --> 738.88
also

736.8 --> 741.1999999999999
considered it's just a very easy

738.88 --> 744.0
mechanical conclusion to draw

741.2 --> 746.1600000000001
that he was trying to express that but

744.0 --> 750.24
it depends on the context of what

746.16 --> 754.399
what he was saying around it basically

750.24 --> 759.839
so there's many ways to interpret that

754.399 --> 759.839
hello agm

770.48 --> 773.839
would you not agree

775.04 --> 787.8389999999999
m1 bare v3

800.72 --> 803.12
anyway

804.959 --> 815.8389999999999
you don't have to respond

816.0 --> 823.04
i think my focus is a lot similar

819.36 --> 823.04
what do you mean angela renee

823.92 --> 827.199
my focus is similar to his are you

826.399 --> 830.72
saying that

827.199 --> 833.04
what is he an esoteric christian

830.72 --> 833.0400000000001
really

836.0 --> 842.88
am i focusing to worship so worship is

840.839 --> 845.7600000000001
attention well the thing is

842.88 --> 845.76
it's a bit of a

847.519 --> 851.279
in the direction of like a formal

849.199 --> 854.3199999999999
logical fallacy situation

851.279 --> 858.959
it's like worshiping is giving attention

854.32 --> 858.9590000000001
but not all attention is giving worship

860.079 --> 865.199
you know focus is a part

863.199 --> 867.4399999999999
of worship that doesn't mean that all

865.199 --> 870.7199999999999
focus is worship

867.44 --> 872.5600000000001
that's kind of the the

870.72 --> 875.0400000000001
little mistake because it's a little

872.56 --> 875.04
mistake

875.12 --> 883.04
it's reef reifying one into the other

879.12 --> 885.519
p therefore q you know

883.04 --> 888.0
q therefore p does not have to be

885.519 --> 888.0
correct

896.839 --> 899.839
see

919.36 --> 924.32
would thinking satan is real make you a

924.839 --> 927.839
satanist

929.12 --> 933.519
that depends on what you think he or it

932.639 --> 937.6
is

933.519 --> 942.399
see but yes obsessing all day

937.6 --> 944.48
over some virtual or actual enemy

942.399 --> 945.44
that you are taking a hostile attitude

944.48 --> 948.48
towards at least

945.44 --> 951.12
and focusing on that a lot obsessing

948.48 --> 954.5600000000001
they call that negative obsession

951.12 --> 956.34
it is

954.56 --> 958.16
well

956.34 --> 961.759
[Applause]

958.16 --> 965.36
can you say this it's complex

961.759 --> 967.92
it's like in a statistical sense

965.36 --> 969.92
in a statistical sense it could be

967.92 --> 971.5999999999999
considered the same because of the

969.92 --> 973.04
effective results

971.6 --> 976.16
because if somebody is talking

973.04 --> 980.0
negatively about something

976.16 --> 982.959
then that will spread it

980.0 --> 984.079
just as much as somebody talking about

982.959 --> 988.0
it constantly

984.079 --> 990.0
positive see now it is not because of

988.0 --> 992.48
the intention behind it

990.0 --> 994.399
and that will draw in other types of

992.48 --> 997.6
approaches when people listening but

994.399 --> 999.12
on average the total spread the total

997.6 --> 1001.519
wave out

999.12 --> 1003.12
will effectively be the same much more

1001.519 --> 1006.32
dramatic differences

1003.12 --> 1007.92
are talking about it extensively

1006.32 --> 1011.6800000000001
positive or negative

1007.92 --> 1013.5999999999999
versus ignoring it and not giving it any

1011.68 --> 1014.2399999999999
attention now there is a dramatic

1013.6 --> 1017.6800000000001
difference

1014.24 --> 1020.48
see so statistically it's very important

1017.68 --> 1020.4799999999999
distinction here

1022.72 --> 1025.839
it's just the effective results that

1024.72 --> 1029.3600000000001
doesn't mean

1025.839 --> 1032.559
the act and what defines the act

1029.36 --> 1034.799
that's not the same problem is what are

1032.559 --> 1037.6789999999999
the effective results

1034.799 --> 1041.36
and statistically things yeah turn out

1037.679 --> 1045.1200000000001
not always as you would like them

1041.36 --> 1045.12
from a more personal perspective

1045.199 --> 1052.0
it was a hard pill to swallow for me in

1047.199 --> 1054.72
general and i'm still working on it

1052.0 --> 1054.72
that you can

1055.039 --> 1058.72
yeah you can the best you can do is set

1056.88 --> 1061.0390000000002
a good example and just hope

1058.72 --> 1063.3600000000001
it will be responded to correctly but at

1061.039 --> 1065.679
the same time consequentially it will

1063.36 --> 1066.08
also clear it up to the enemy and help

1065.679 --> 1069.919
them

1066.08 --> 1071.1999999999998
plan against it and that counts for both

1069.919 --> 1081.8400000000001
sides

1071.2 --> 1081.8400000000001
it's quite surreal statistically

1092.24 --> 1099.919
i don't know i didn't like him too much

1096.16 --> 1103.2
on owen benjamin i thought he was

1099.919 --> 1108.0800000000002
i thought it was kind of gay

1103.2 --> 1111.2
so yeah

1108.08 --> 1114.0
that's i don't like that so

1111.2 --> 1114.0
yeah sorry

1114.4 --> 1118.64
just because the ideas are good doesn't

1116.96 --> 1120.4
mean i'm gonna like the person you know

1118.64 --> 1122.4
there's other people out there whose

1120.4 --> 1124.64
ideas are actually kind of interesting

1122.4 --> 1125.52
but just their personality just makes it

1124.64 --> 1127.679
impossible

1125.52 --> 1129.44
for me to constructively engage with

1127.679 --> 1133.679
them

1129.44 --> 1135.679
for example pga right to hand

1133.679 --> 1137.52
those are great examples of people that

1135.679 --> 1139.52
actually have

1137.52 --> 1141.679
an interesting element about them but

1139.52 --> 1144.799
yeah the rest of it

1141.679 --> 1147.8400000000001
you know what i mean well

1144.799 --> 1150.32
maybe it's not like

1147.84 --> 1152.72
james true would be literally in their

1150.32 --> 1158.48
type of classification

1152.72 --> 1158.48
from my perspective but it is a similar

1162.84 --> 1165.84
dilemma

1173.52 --> 1180.0
right m1 bear 3 v3

1177.2 --> 1181.919
yeah i don't even know in what i don't

1180.0 --> 1183.76
remember in what kind of levels of

1181.919 --> 1186.96
wizardry he is what type of

1183.76 --> 1190.0
wizard standardized story

1186.96 --> 1192.0
element choices he has made in his

1190.0 --> 1194.72
vernacular i don't know i don't remember

1192.0 --> 1196.72
because as soon as i figured out i'm not

1194.72 --> 1199.2
gonna like this guy i just put it out of

1196.72 --> 1199.2
my mind

1200.64 --> 1206.159
you know that's my strategy because

1202.159 --> 1221.8400000000001
statistically that's more effective just

1206.159 --> 1221.8400000000001
forget about it

1236.72 --> 1241.28
on re what

1241.6 --> 1245.9189999999999
i think you got some keyboard problems

1243.679 --> 1245.919
there

1246.799 --> 1254.799
angel renee do i ever make bone broth

1251.76 --> 1258.96
never done it no

1254.799 --> 1261.84
uh i do remember that my dad has made it

1258.96 --> 1262.32
way back in the past like as a project

1261.84 --> 1265.84
hell

1262.32 --> 1268.32
during like a health project phase

1265.84 --> 1270.08
my mother and him organized it but

1268.32 --> 1273.28
that's like a long time ago

1270.08 --> 1277.9189999999999
i personally never made it also it

1273.28 --> 1279.84
stinks a lot for a very long time

1277.919 --> 1282.3200000000002
i'm not gonna do that in this kitchen

1279.84 --> 1285.76
here that's gonna make everybody

1282.32 --> 1291.6789999999999
really complain and i don't know

1285.76 --> 1291.679
i think you can buy it organic variants

1294.32 --> 1302.24
remember when

1298.799 --> 1304.799
alex jones used to sell it and then it

1302.24 --> 1306.48
kind of discontinued

1304.799 --> 1310.24
unfortunately it was a really good

1306.48 --> 1310.24
product with nice chocolate taste

1310.4 --> 1314.5590000000002
and other good ingredients accompanying

1312.64 --> 1316.64
it

1314.559 --> 1319.36
but yeah but i haven't had that for like

1316.64 --> 1322.5590000000002
two years now

1319.36 --> 1326.24
it's been a while but still i get

1322.559 --> 1329.12
organic chicken soup and all that

1326.24 --> 1329.1200000000001
it's close enough

1330.84 --> 1333.84
uh

1342.32 --> 1344.6399999999999
what

1345.36 --> 1361.84
who is our ease

1348.48 --> 1361.84
i don't know who you are referring to

1369.28 --> 1375.84
i know him

1386.84 --> 1389.84
so

1390.16 --> 1393.259
[Music]

1396.88 --> 1403.919
okay m1 bear v3 if you're saying so

1400.64 --> 1408.3200000000002
she didn't correct it you know so

1403.919 --> 1408.3200000000002
but that makes a little bit more sense

1411.84 --> 1415.12
yeah that's right it's not nice george

1413.52 --> 1418.4
sanford but now everybody

1415.12 --> 1420.32
is telling me it's qe in but but

1418.4 --> 1421.52
angela renee who hasn't corrected it

1420.32 --> 1424.72
here see

1421.52 --> 1424.72
does it again ari

1426.4 --> 1431.8400000000001
do you mean to round earth

1429.76 --> 1434.24
is that that's a weird terminology i've

1431.84 --> 1439.279
never seen that before

1434.24 --> 1439.279
flat earth is referencing it like that

1441.84 --> 1447.36
i think that the terminology we use is

1444.559 --> 1447.36
globe earth

1453.039 --> 1461.039
yeah by the way see i was right see how

1456.24 --> 1461.039
easy such mistakes are made

1462.159 --> 1469.44
this is the accident with

1466.159 --> 1472.7990000000002
quick remarks and then word of mouth

1469.44 --> 1474.88
rumors so you see things can

1472.799 --> 1477.36
very easily be taken out of context

1474.88 --> 1480.88
that's why i always

1477.36 --> 1480.8799999999999
ask the person who said it

1483.44 --> 1489.039
right because you never know for sure if

1487.12 --> 1491.039
you're just going to baseline assume it

1489.039 --> 1493.6
and build on that then later it may turn

1491.039 --> 1496.0
out to all have been wrong

1493.6 --> 1496.0
anyway

1498.24 --> 1502.799
so she was saying so right there and

1501.12 --> 1505.9189999999999
videos like this point

1502.799 --> 1508.799
on globe earth

1505.919 --> 1510.24
comparing it to faith religion well yeah

1508.799 --> 1513.36
not i'm not surprised

1510.24 --> 1516.08
because right hand really gets that part

1513.36 --> 1517.36
and he's you know right to hands

1516.08 --> 1519.36
cognition

1517.36 --> 1521.279
has not always been the biggest problem

1519.36 --> 1524.1589999999999
his problem is his

1521.279 --> 1527.52
social interaction and his well savonia

1524.159 --> 1530.5590000000002
tendencies obsession negative obsession

1527.52 --> 1532.24
and attacking and all that that's been

1530.559 --> 1536.1589999999999
his main problem

1532.24 --> 1538.799
but yeah right to hand has been

1536.159 --> 1540.0
i think he even follows my channel

1538.799 --> 1541.84
sometimes when he's

1540.0 --> 1544.08
in the mood for it even though he's

1541.84 --> 1547.12
banned from commenting

1544.08 --> 1548.32
or at least he seems to be i can't find

1547.12 --> 1551.36
him

1548.32 --> 1553.4399999999998
in my moderation list he says he's

1551.36 --> 1557.76
banned so i don't know what's going on

1553.44 --> 1559.44
on that department but whatever

1557.76 --> 1561.039
but i'm not surprised that he's been

1559.44 --> 1564.159
paying attention to my

1561.039 --> 1565.919
analogies com yeah to basically

1564.159 --> 1567.679
describe the globe religion and the

1565.919 --> 1569.44
psychological mechanics and i think that

1567.679 --> 1570.88
a lot of flat earthers are probably

1569.44 --> 1573.279
paying attention

1570.88 --> 1574.7990000000002
to me when i do that sort of thing

1573.279 --> 1576.96
because it is in

1574.799 --> 1579.52
a lot of flat earthers interest to get a

1576.96 --> 1581.919
grasp on that

1579.52 --> 1583.6
just in order to get some oversight and

1581.919 --> 1585.44
calm the [ __ ] down versus all this

1583.6 --> 1588.7199999999998
trolling and [ __ ]

1585.44 --> 1591.3600000000001
so there is a need to understand global

1588.72 --> 1592.32
psychological mechanics and how their

1591.36 --> 1594.9599999999998
faith works

1592.32 --> 1596.6399999999999
how their trains of thinking work in

1594.96 --> 1600.24
order to

1596.64 --> 1603.76
defend against all the

1600.24 --> 1604.72
oh all the yeah the side effects all

1603.76 --> 1607.12
that

1604.72 --> 1609.44
all the ruckus that it causes especially

1607.12 --> 1612.1589999999999
among flat earthers

1609.44 --> 1614.64
because that's who they seem to target

1612.159 --> 1614.64
the most

1615.36 --> 1618.7199999999998
they're not targeting normies they're

1617.279 --> 1621.76
not like

1618.72 --> 1624.08
oh let's look out for normies and let's

1621.76 --> 1626.1589999999999
send them messages about ooh

1624.08 --> 1627.4399999999998
flat earthers are a problem no no no

1626.159 --> 1633.0390000000002
they get on

1627.44 --> 1636.159
our backs in our chats

1633.039 --> 1638.799
and then maybe newcomers

1636.159 --> 1640.3200000000002
if they're there then maybe they'll try

1638.799 --> 1643.52
to peer pressure them

1640.32 --> 1648.399
out of like going away again

1643.52 --> 1649.84
that's i think their primary strategy to

1648.399 --> 1651.52
deal with normies

1649.84 --> 1653.039
but other than that they're just trying

1651.52 --> 1655.36
to be a burden on us

1653.039 --> 1657.52
effectively statistically on the long

1655.36 --> 1657.52
run

1658.559 --> 1664.399
discouraging policy so they're basically

1662.32 --> 1666.1589999999999
creating a psychological warfare

1664.399 --> 1669.039
extension of a very

1666.159 --> 1670.7990000000002
basic system of peer pressure

1669.039 --> 1672.799
discouraging

1670.799 --> 1675.6
which is what happens in school very

1672.799 --> 1675.6
young and all that

1676.159 --> 1679.5200000000002
and they're just continuating that

1678.08 --> 1683.84
effect with

1679.52 --> 1683.84
psychological warfare strategies

1684.48 --> 1687.52
and i'll bet you that the things they

1686.48 --> 1690.559
are doing

1687.52 --> 1691.76
could be found in manuals for such a

1690.559 --> 1693.9189999999999
thing

1691.76 --> 1696.64
you would find it back and then see like

1693.919 --> 1699.919
wow that reminds me a lot of this

1696.64 --> 1699.919
that's happening everywhere

1701.679 --> 1704.3200000000002
i'll bet you

1705.6 --> 1711.279
because these people are often

1708.64 --> 1714.0
have like literate backgrounds they have

1711.279 --> 1714.0
read books

1715.52 --> 1722.48
doesn't mean that they'll embrace

1719.279 --> 1724.32
absolute fact and logic but it means

1722.48 --> 1726.48
they have seen a lot of material

1724.32 --> 1728.32
and that includes probably just

1726.48 --> 1731.52
strategies

1728.32 --> 1731.9189999999999
because yeah it is good to learn that to

1731.52 --> 1734.6399999999999
gain

1731.919 --> 1736.7990000000002
more grip on the situation especially if

1734.64 --> 1740.72
you have no moral objections to

1736.799 --> 1743.2
just be more manipulative with everyone

1740.72 --> 1745.279
and yeah a lot of globals have no

1743.2 --> 1749.6000000000001
objection to that because they are

1745.279 --> 1752.24
doing exactly that now they're doing it

1749.6 --> 1753.36
for their religious faith for their love

1752.24 --> 1757.76
of the globe and to

1753.36 --> 1761.1999999999998
save it from the flood earthers

1757.76 --> 1764.64
but they still engage to that level of

1761.2 --> 1766.159
well social disrespect you could call it

1764.64 --> 1768.96
you can consider it

1766.159 --> 1769.7600000000002
as such to just be more manipulative and

1768.96 --> 1781.8400000000001
to lie to

1769.76 --> 1781.84
people's face to accomplish something

1784.559 --> 1795.84
oh dear what's this

1800.159 --> 1809.8400000000001
oh god freaking yeah

1810.32 --> 1823.84
it's the mask slavery revolution

1829.039 --> 1833.44
you know that the entire premise for the

1831.039 --> 1837.039
whole corona mask situation

1833.44 --> 1840.799
is very basic

1837.039 --> 1844.8799999999999
premise it's very a basic old trick

1840.799 --> 1844.8799999999999
that is just you spread rumors

1845.6 --> 1849.52
about something terrible and then you

1848.08 --> 1852.799
sell the solution

1849.52 --> 1855.9189999999999
to it everywhere

1852.799 --> 1856.96
that works it's a very basic marketing

1855.919 --> 1860.72
scam

1856.96 --> 1863.279
now of course it's been elaborated upon

1860.72 --> 1865.6000000000001
very extensively it's like find tailored

1863.279 --> 1869.76
how it's been worked out

1865.6 --> 1873.84
but the basic premise is just that

1869.76 --> 1875.76
because if you don't fall for it then

1873.84 --> 1877.4399999999998
yeah you're not gonna buy the mask of

1875.76 --> 1880.48
course

1877.44 --> 1883.679
but yeah this enforcing

1880.48 --> 1886.64
it is coming through people that are

1883.679 --> 1886.64
buying into it

1887.519 --> 1895.29
so the scam is like invading

1892.24 --> 1896.48
through corporations and politicians

1895.29 --> 1898.799

1896.48 --> 1900.3990000000001
that are buying into it now whether they

1898.799 --> 1902.96
know it's all false

1900.399 --> 1905.279
and are just going for the scam or for

1902.96 --> 1907.6000000000001
some money interest

1905.279 --> 1910.159
or whether they really believe it and

1907.6 --> 1913.4399999999998
are just really naive

1910.159 --> 1914.64
that's up for each individual to figure

1913.44 --> 1918.48
that out

1914.64 --> 1921.519
about the yeah the people that do that

1918.48 --> 1924.3990000000001
you got to size them up like are they

1921.519 --> 1925.919
actively trying to fool everyone you can

1924.399 --> 1928.2399999999998
feel it

1925.919 --> 1930.3990000000001
to what degree and some people may have

1928.24 --> 1932.88
like a feeling like oh [ __ ]

1930.399 --> 1934.08
yeah it's probably fake but i have no

1932.88 --> 1936.48
choice or something so

1934.08 --> 1939.76
just don't think about it too much that

1936.48 --> 1939.76
can also be going on

1940.96 --> 1943.279
right

1944.559 --> 1948.08
but there's definitely plenty of players

1946.96 --> 1950.08
out there that are

1948.08 --> 1952.0
in the know it's all a scam and that are

1950.08 --> 1955.4399999999998
just

1952.0 --> 1960.84
very actively doubling down on it

1955.44 --> 1963.8400000000001
and yeah making things worse for

1960.84 --> 1963.84
everyone

1974.559 --> 1978.72
yeah we'll see about sinterklaas this

1976.559 --> 1980.1589999999999
year you know it might be that santa

1978.72 --> 1982.3990000000001
claus might be

1980.159 --> 1984.88
might be cancelled because he has corona

1982.399 --> 1984.8799999999999
so he can

1985.679 --> 1990.48
he has to stay in spain this time maybe

1988.72 --> 1992.96
i don't know they could go for something

1990.48 --> 1992.96
like that

1993.039 --> 2005.84
that would be terrible especially for

1995.44 --> 2005.8400000000001
little kids

2007.44 --> 2013.8400000000001
i always loved like that celebration

2011.279 --> 2016.24
even when i did figure out he was fake

2013.84 --> 2019.519
because of the tradition of just

2016.24 --> 2022.159
making presents and just not just

2019.519 --> 2022.72
presents like christmas but like are you

2022.159 --> 2026.3200000000002
called

2022.72 --> 2027.919
supr supresses surprise gifts it's like

2026.32 --> 2030.559
you get creative

2027.919 --> 2032.0
and you can make a puzzle out of it or

2030.559 --> 2034.399
really yeah

2032.0 --> 2035.84
some oh practical jokes there's all

2034.399 --> 2037.4399999999998
kinds of things you can do

2035.84 --> 2040.1589999999999
that are traditionally part of

2037.44 --> 2040.159
sinterklaas

2041.519 --> 2049.359
it's a time to get creative

2047.039 --> 2050.159
anyway i haven't personally done it in a

2049.359 --> 2053.52
long time

2050.159 --> 2056.399
because yeah it's no

2053.52 --> 2058.56
yeah i've always done that with family

2056.399 --> 2062.3199999999997
and yeah we haven't been

2058.56 --> 2062.32
haven't done that since my mother died

2065.839 --> 2071.679
if i'm gonna have kids someday i will

2068.96 --> 2074.48
definitely do that again

2071.679 --> 2076.0
it's almost like a necessity because

2074.48 --> 2080.8
it's also an opportunity

2076.0 --> 2080.8
for kids to learn how to get creative

2081.28 --> 2085.679
and the funny thing is is because you

2083.28 --> 2088.0
have full control over the situation you

2085.679 --> 2090.159
can be creative in a specific type of

2088.0 --> 2091.679
way if you want you have full control

2090.159 --> 2093.28
over the process

2091.679 --> 2096.0
depending on your family if somebody in

2093.28 --> 2099.2000000000003
your family is nutty and you can't

2096.0 --> 2102.32
make them stop they'll do that

2099.2 --> 2104.16
but it's not like with television and

2102.32 --> 2106.2400000000002
all that that there's always going to be

2104.16 --> 2106.7999999999997
programming of a certain type sneaking

2106.24 --> 2110.0789999999997
in

2106.8 --> 2113.2000000000003
so you can be very creative

2110.079 --> 2118.1600000000003
and completely on your own

2113.2 --> 2118.16
compass when you do this with your kids

2119.76 --> 2124.88
oh god grow new mask wearing sinter

2122.48 --> 2124.88
glass

2125.03 --> 2128.0890000000004
[Music]

2128.64 --> 2134.0789999999997
i don't think so you know sinterklaas

2130.96 --> 2134.079
lived through the plague

2134.4 --> 2138.32
so he does not need no freaking face

2137.52 --> 2145.839
mask

2138.32 --> 2145.839
dude that guy's practically immortal

2147.26 --> 2150.3590000000004
[Music]

2150.4 --> 2154.64
if you're going to presuppose he's a

2151.92 --> 2154.64
real figure

2154.96 --> 2173.839
which i have no objection to for the fun

2158.16 --> 2173.839
of it

2180.16 --> 2187.04
masked reindeer oh god

2184.0 --> 2189.92
that's just terrible but yeah

2187.04 --> 2191.599
sans interclass here in the netherlands

2189.92 --> 2195.04
he doesn't use reindeer

2191.599 --> 2198.48
he has a boat and

2195.04 --> 2201.119
other than boat he rides by horse

2198.48 --> 2202.96
it is said he also rides on his horse

2201.119 --> 2204.88
over the rooftops

2202.96 --> 2207.119
so there's no flight going on with santa

2204.88 --> 2210.079
he's just going by old-fashioned boat

2207.119 --> 2212.079
i think that america got it in her head

2210.079 --> 2213.28
to make him a flying figure thanks to

2212.079 --> 2215.44
coca-cola

2213.28 --> 2217.76
because it was the same period it was

2215.44 --> 2218.8
the same time period of futurism and

2217.76 --> 2222.0
superman

2218.8 --> 2225.599
i think superman originally inspired

2222.0 --> 2229.119
santa claus to have flying reindeer

2225.599 --> 2231.599
uh huh

2229.119 --> 2233.52
now of course i could be adam yeah

2231.599 --> 2236.32
extremely wrong it might be that he

2233.52 --> 2239.2
yeah i've heard that there's like this

2236.32 --> 2239.2000000000003
very old

2240.0 --> 2246.4
caucasian native russian as it were

2244.0 --> 2248.24
santa claus type figure there as well

2246.4 --> 2249.28
and that he might also have been derived

2248.24 --> 2252.56
from that

2249.28 --> 2253.119
but the flying part i'm not sure if that

2252.56 --> 2256.7999999999997
is also

2253.119 --> 2260.6400000000003
part of that ancient story

2256.8 --> 2260.6400000000003
telling tradition which is much older

2260.72 --> 2265.1189999999997
compared to santa claus which is really

2263.28 --> 2271.8390000000004
a 20th century invention

2265.119 --> 2271.839
guys it's 20th century

2275.52 --> 2280.079
he's older than the globe and the moon

2278.8 --> 2284.11
landing

2280.079 --> 2287.309
but he's not that old

2284.11 --> 2287.309
[Music]

2289.52 --> 2292.96
yeah but santa's horse ain't wearing no

2291.76 --> 2298.1600000000003
mask

2292.96 --> 2299.119
he needs to sniff out the carrots know

2298.16 --> 2302.8799999999997
that horse

2299.119 --> 2305.599
should be like fat as [ __ ] because

2302.88 --> 2306.7200000000003
i was always taught as a kid like you

2305.599 --> 2309.119
have to

2306.72 --> 2312.0
put your shoe next to the heart that we

2309.119 --> 2313.92
don't use socks we just put shoes

2312.0 --> 2316.72
and then yeah you put something in the

2313.92 --> 2319.839
shoe like a carrot

2316.72 --> 2320.7999999999997
for the horse that's how we used to do

2319.839 --> 2324.0789999999997
it but yeah just

2320.8 --> 2325.599
imagine like hundreds thousands

2324.079 --> 2328.079
maybe millions of kids in the

2325.599 --> 2330.1600000000003
netherlands probably millions

2328.079 --> 2332.079
doing that every night that horse is

2330.16 --> 2336.0
gonna be fat as [ __ ]

2332.079 --> 2337.8390000000004
this is on the other hand i guess that

2336.0 --> 2341.119
riding rooftops all the time

2337.839 --> 2343.44
without making noise is probably really

2341.119 --> 2345.599
energy consuming so he just

2343.44 --> 2347.92
his metabolism must be super high it

2345.599 --> 2351.52
must be just going in and out

2347.92 --> 2355.839
in a matter of seconds so he probably

2351.52 --> 2355.839
needs all that food

2361.04 --> 2366.56
yeah roger i think they're having

2364.16 --> 2368.72
trouble catching on

2366.56 --> 2370.96
yeah i'm talking about dutch tradition

2368.72 --> 2370.9599999999996
now

2371.76 --> 2379.119
yeah sinterklaas is not santa claus

2375.359 --> 2383.839
sinterklaas we were first our tradition

2379.119 --> 2383.839
is from the 19th century we were first

2387.79 --> 2390.969
[Music]

2394.07 --> 2400.32
[Music]

2396.32 --> 2403.76
you know have you ever tried

2400.32 --> 2404.7200000000003
that that rasta that's literally called

2403.76 --> 2407.5200000000004
the muzzle

2404.72 --> 2409.1189999999997
if you would put a face diaper that we

2407.52 --> 2411.839
put on on a horse

2409.119 --> 2412.7200000000003
they would just eat it up in like five

2411.839 --> 2416.0789999999997
seconds

2412.72 --> 2420.319
it would just go i'll

2416.079 --> 2420.319
maybe spit it out maybe just swallow it

2420.56 --> 2424.7999999999997
besides where are you going to put those

2422.16 --> 2425.7599999999998
rings the horse ears are like way back

2424.8 --> 2430.96
there

2425.76 --> 2430.96
it's not really gonna work yeah feeding

2436.839 --> 2439.839
bag

2441.04 --> 2444.64
i guess that masking a horse will be

2443.28 --> 2449.599
very easy

2444.64 --> 2453.52
to do but they don't need to though

2449.599 --> 2457.2000000000003
i don't think yeah horses are viable

2453.52 --> 2460.48
to viruses or even colds

2457.2 --> 2460.48
i don't think they get them

2461.04 --> 2467.839
not our colds anyway

2471.2 --> 2481.839
their metabolism works differently

2473.44 --> 2481.839
although they do get sick no doubt

2484.88 --> 2492.7200000000003
i've have seen horses having colds

2487.92 --> 2492.7200000000003
but it's just it's not the same

2492.88 --> 2496.079
so there's officially it's not the same

2495.04 --> 2498.4
it's like

2496.079 --> 2502.0
horses can't catch human colds and

2498.4 --> 2504.1600000000003
humans can't catch horse colds

2502.0 --> 2505.92
and i've experienced that because i've

2504.16 --> 2509.7599999999998
done horseback riding quite

2505.92 --> 2511.52
a long time when i was a kid and

2509.76 --> 2514.1600000000003
yeah i have seen those horses getting

2511.52 --> 2517.359
colds and me riding those horses even

2514.16 --> 2520.8799999999997
because they would still ride

2517.359 --> 2520.88
they would just be very snotty

2521.52 --> 2526.16
and yeah i wouldn't get a cold from that

2523.359 --> 2526.16
at all ever

2527.52 --> 2537.839
it's just a bit yucky with all that snot

2530.96 --> 2537.839
that's all

2553.599 --> 2559.76
mink and ferret what

2557.359 --> 2562.319
yeah they always go for these freaking

2559.76 --> 2564.8
animal genocides every time don't they

2562.319 --> 2567.359
the medical industrial complex

2564.8 --> 2569.44
they're all about genocide and if they

2567.359 --> 2572.319
can't genocide people away then they

2569.44 --> 2574.2400000000002
usually just attack farms and [ __ ] they

2572.319 --> 2577.2799999999997
just start genociding animals

2574.24 --> 2579.2799999999997
declare good it's sick now they must all

2577.28 --> 2582.5600000000004
die just like that

2579.28 --> 2582.5600000000004
it's so disgusting

2582.72 --> 2593.839
it's unbelievable that that happens

2596.55 --> 2601.2000000000003
[Music]

2597.76 --> 2603.28
i have foot and mouth right from what i

2601.2 --> 2604.3999999999996
remember that wasn't even a really bad

2603.28 --> 2607.119
disease

2604.4 --> 2609.119
it wasn't contagious it was just more

2607.119 --> 2611.839
like an ailment

2609.119 --> 2613.44
and only animals in really terrible

2611.839 --> 2616.48
living conditions would

2613.44 --> 2621.839
like potentially die from it

2616.48 --> 2621.839
that's what i remember

2622.96 --> 2628.48
but you know yours universally it is

2626.0 --> 2628.48
like that

2628.56 --> 2632.7999999999997
if if you're gonna keep farming animals

2631.44 --> 2636.319
you should just keep them

2632.8 --> 2639.04
under organic conditions feed them the

2636.319 --> 2642.64
right stuff give them enough space

2639.04 --> 2644.96
give them enough moments in their life

2642.64 --> 2646.96
to actually feel what it is like to be

2644.96 --> 2649.68
that animal in a natural way

2646.96 --> 2650.8
because that helps a lot against them

2649.68 --> 2654.56
getting sick

2650.8 --> 2654.5600000000004
against the quality of their meat

2655.52 --> 2657.92
you know

2659.52 --> 2662.64
and i don't think that i don't remember

2662.24 --> 2666.0
ever

2662.64 --> 2677.839
any organic forms having disease

2666.0 --> 2677.839
outbreaks like that they shouldn't

2686.8 --> 2691.76
maybe a mistake maybe there have been

2688.64 --> 2694.7999999999997
some farms organic farms that have been

2691.76 --> 2699.2000000000003
like cleared out

2694.8 --> 2705.8390000000004
animal genocided at some point

2699.2 --> 2705.839
i don't know i hope not

2723.2 --> 2733.839
yuck it don't get all dirty and

2727.599 --> 2733.839
perverted in my chat thanks

2739.2 --> 2744.72
elf on the back of a poor sick horse

2742.64 --> 2746.16
not poor and sick they were very happy

2744.72 --> 2749.2799999999997
to get out

2746.16 --> 2752.48
like horses with colds have need

2749.28 --> 2755.92
to move it as well you know

2752.48 --> 2759.2
like horses really need time to move

2755.92 --> 2760.48
every day if they don't get it if you

2759.2 --> 2763.2799999999997
like keep a horse

2760.48 --> 2765.04
in a stable for an entire day longer

2763.28 --> 2766.6400000000003
than a single day

2765.04 --> 2769.44
there's a big chance that they'll get

2766.64 --> 2771.52
like depressed or even hysterical

2769.44 --> 2773.2000000000003
they will start like kicking against the

2771.52 --> 2775.28
walls and [ __ ]

2773.2 --> 2777.4399999999996
it's like get me out here i need to move

2775.28 --> 2779.92
i'm sick i'm getting

yeah matthew eastman that's that's what

2888.4 --> 2892.4
i call it

very old running gag on the flat earth

2896.559 --> 2900.88
early bird show

2897.839 --> 2905.52
i used to like eat them a lot

2900.88 --> 2907.76
when i guess wasn't as fluid

2905.52 --> 2908.64
as i am now so i just kind of used it as

2907.76 --> 2911.6800000000003
an extra just

2908.64 --> 2913.68
yeah just eating because i

2911.68 --> 2916.0
yeah the first the primary objective was

2913.68 --> 2919.04
to just somehow do an

2916.0 --> 2921.76
an everyday an hour show

2919.04 --> 2923.839
and at first that was quite a challenge

2921.76 --> 2927.2000000000003
now i'm used to it

2923.839 --> 2929.7599999999998
so yeah that prop base it's not a prop

2927.2 --> 2931.2799999999997
it's it's literally food

2929.76 --> 2933.6800000000003
