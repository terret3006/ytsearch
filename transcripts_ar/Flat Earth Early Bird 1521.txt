actually raining here up until like 15

92.04 --> 94.759
minutes ago

96.42 --> 99.9
so yeah there's some slightly bigger

98.759 --> 103.68
clouds

99.9 --> 105.24000000000001
flying over with rain in them coming out

103.68 --> 107.04
other than that it's pretty much the

105.24 --> 109.32
same weather as yesterday seems to be

107.04 --> 111.60000000000001
very little wind

109.32 --> 115.1
a lot of moist in the air

111.6 --> 118.28999999999999
so it does feel kind of cold

115.1 --> 118.28999999999999
[Music]

121.92 --> 124.759
let's see

133.2 --> 137.17999999999998

then according to this V3 really clear

178.08 --> 184.56
days with some freezing at night

181.8 --> 186.36
but clear sunny days Monday to Wednesday

184.56 --> 188.58
according to this

186.36 --> 190.68
we'll see

188.58 --> 192.78
looking forward to some more sun

190.68 --> 195.3
actually

192.78 --> 196.68
right so yeah a little gloomy indeed

195.3 --> 199.68
Goldie

196.68 --> 199.68
huh

202.26 --> 207.659
man my tea is so freaking hot you can

205.319 --> 210.5
actually see the steam of it

207.659 --> 210.5
on the camera

214.09 --> 217.24
[Music]

222.739 --> 228.299
ah right

226.2 --> 231.26
so yeah I'm uh

228.299 --> 231.26000000000002
doing okay

232.26 --> 236.29899999999998
yesterday was a bit of a weird day

237.239 --> 241.56
like lots of tensions going around

239.22 --> 244.56
apparently

241.56 --> 247.14000000000001
and then I got into like this spat it's

244.56 --> 250.08
a spat it's just I tried to correct

247.14 --> 252.54
somebody's behavior and they are still

250.08 --> 254.959
complaining about it

252.54 --> 254.959
foreign

272.18 --> 279.6
chat no no no over at fed

277.08 --> 282.18
it's just Michael Khan was like

279.6 --> 285.06
continually timing somebody out that

282.18 --> 287.639
really didn't do anything

285.06 --> 289.32
just trying to say something and but he

287.639 --> 291.12
just said no you're a troll I'm just

289.32 --> 294.0
gonna keep

291.12 --> 297.0
timing you out even though he didn't say

294.0 --> 297.96
anything like or well you would say like

297.0 --> 299.58
huh

297.96 --> 302.4
or like

299.58 --> 304.5
just not ad homing just trying to say

302.4 --> 307.44
like no it's a globe or something right

304.5 --> 310.259
it's just thick thick globally for and

307.44 --> 313.44
it's like not fair

310.259 --> 315.54
it's not fair to just keep yeah pushing

313.44 --> 316.86
them just because they believe in

315.54 --> 318.62
something else when they're not

316.86 --> 321.78000000000003
misbehaving

318.62 --> 323.22
so I I didn't really do anything other

321.78 --> 325.44
than just hey could you please stop

323.22 --> 328.259
doing that

325.44 --> 331.979
and then he kept complaining about like

328.259 --> 334.139
oh my God he's a troll and I'm like okay

331.979 --> 337.139
this duper poons character you might

334.139 --> 339.66
have seen him around he hangs in at flat

337.139 --> 343.46000000000004
swords too and all that you can see him

339.66 --> 343.46000000000004
in over at Jim Bob I think

343.62 --> 350.52
and he's just a dumb Globe believer

347.46 --> 352.08
but he doesn't seem like a troll and so

350.52 --> 353.639
I asked like so what's the evidence

352.08 --> 356.28
what's the evidence that he is a troll

353.639 --> 359.88
what did he do what did you catch him

356.28 --> 363.35999999999996
doing to justify that he is a troll

359.88 --> 364.86
and he'd had nothing he had nothing to

363.36 --> 366.90000000000003
present for it

364.86 --> 369.78000000000003
and instead

366.9 --> 371.09999999999997
tenth man dove in there because it's all

369.78 --> 374.75899999999996
on Skype

371.1 --> 378.06
this bickering and now Neil

374.759 --> 380.639
and he has not still provided any

378.06 --> 383.1
measure of evidence that is Patrol and

380.639 --> 388.699
they're all siding with Michael

383.1 --> 388.699
okay this is [ __ ] annoying as [ __ ]

389.1 --> 394.139
like how dare you correct your fellow

392.34 --> 396.29999999999995
flat earther when they're misbehaving

394.139 --> 400.02
and making us all look bad how dare you

396.3 --> 402.479
Arwin let's pile on the three of us

400.02 --> 404.34
to make you think that you've done

402.479 --> 408.18
something bad for trying to correct

404.34 --> 410.28
somebody's misbehavior how dare you and

408.18 --> 412.74
I've already done that with Paul and she

410.28 --> 414.84
left because of it oh yes dance man drag

412.74 --> 417.36
all that [ __ ] back in there

414.84 --> 419.88
pull in the bed the Dead Horse let's

417.36 --> 423.139
kick it some

419.88 --> 423.139
like what the [ __ ]

428.34 --> 433.56
you're familiar with him yeah

430.56 --> 438.18
and I mean he's not a troll

433.56 --> 440.4
he's just a dumb Globe believer

438.18 --> 442.919
I've had interactions with him where he

440.4 --> 445.56
would actually just give honest

442.919 --> 448.919
responses being flustered by my

445.56 --> 451.86
explanations which tells me he is a

448.919 --> 453.0
Glover not an anti-flat earth or not a

451.86 --> 454.68
troll

453.0 --> 457.259
because there's still globers out there

454.68 --> 459.3
and they ride with this role

457.259 --> 460.8
but they don't know what they're doing

459.3 --> 463.38
that's the glober

460.8 --> 465.599
and so they get flustered and they are

463.38 --> 467.3
honestly expressing it because they

465.599 --> 471.06
don't have any

467.3 --> 474.139
negative motivations

471.06 --> 478.02
they're not there to lie and deceive

474.139 --> 479.699
they really think that

478.02 --> 482.34
they're doing the right thing and that

479.699 --> 484.5
they're correct

482.34 --> 486.0
they're still out there yeah oh after

484.5 --> 488.639
seven years yeah that's really cute

486.0 --> 491.46
there's people popping up just getting

488.639 --> 492.3
to know about this and they will be like

491.46 --> 495.25899999999996
that

492.3 --> 498.419
and if you then start bullying them

495.259 --> 501.18
guess how that's gonna turn out in the

498.419 --> 504.78
end yeah then probably going to then

501.18 --> 506.039
turn into an anti-flat earther

504.78 --> 508.919
yeah

506.039 --> 510.599
why do you think I I make this effort to

508.919 --> 513.539
correct

510.599 --> 515.779
because I know what happens when you

513.539 --> 515.779
don't

516.419 --> 522.4789999999999
creating more enemies creating more

520.2 --> 525.0600000000001
people that will do more stupid things

522.479 --> 527.0400000000001
stuck in the Reversed world because you

525.06 --> 528.959
insist that they were a troll and

527.04 --> 531.54
thought that was a green light to start

528.959 --> 534.5
bullying them

531.54 --> 534.5
foreign

543.39 --> 546.87
[Music]

547.22 --> 553.38
yeah that was another thing that Charlie

549.779 --> 556.86
girl got I had to literally just

553.38 --> 559.2
PVP complained to flat side

556.86 --> 562.26
and he's just oh I can't do anything oh

559.2 --> 564.24
no I can't do anything no but then he

562.26 --> 566.3389999999999
removed everybody's wrenches and then

564.24 --> 567.72
she stopped acting like a freaking

566.339 --> 569.7
Madman

567.72 --> 572.1600000000001
mad woman

569.7 --> 574.32
so that was the solution oh we can take

572.16 --> 578.519
everybody's wrenches and then maybe

574.32 --> 581.0400000000001
she'll not go angry oh no I'm I'm a boy

578.519 --> 582.839
I'm a little [ __ ] can't handle a stupid

581.04 --> 584.519
[ __ ] in the chat with a wrench that's

582.839 --> 587.6400000000001
going berserk

584.519 --> 590.88
or you really want them why why would

587.64 --> 594.18
you really want them you have a wife

590.88 --> 596.72
makes no [ __ ] sense

594.18 --> 596.7199999999999
foreign

600.42 --> 604.9799999999999
people with terrible behavior in chat

602.7 --> 608.6
that are out of control and when you try

604.98 --> 612.24
to correct them they'll spend hours

608.6 --> 616.32
whining and bickering against you about

612.24 --> 619.6800000000001
it how [ __ ] dare you you humiliate Me

616.32 --> 623.519
by correcting my terrible Behavior

619.68 --> 628.019
how dare you you're the you're a troll

623.519 --> 631.44
lover I'm a troll lover according

628.019 --> 633.48
to Michael Khan I protect the trolls

631.44 --> 636.74
even though he doesn't have any evidence

633.48 --> 636.74
that he is a troll

637.94 --> 645.12
self-admittedly but he'll still spend

641.399 --> 647.519
another full day bickering about it

645.12 --> 649.74
even though he did not actually have

647.519 --> 652.86
that proof that he was a troll

649.74 --> 655.2
with two other people willing to side

652.86 --> 658.82
with him even though he did not provide

655.2 --> 658.82
any evidence that he was a troll

660.839 --> 665.5790000000001
yeah

662.579 --> 667.76
God I don't want this to be a complainy

665.579 --> 667.76
show

669.24 --> 673.44
but I mean

670.82 --> 676.339
right before I even started the show

673.44 --> 682.8000000000001
like it still went on in the Skype

676.339 --> 682.8000000000001
meal God damn it these guys ah

697.56 --> 701.66
yeah I agree Zepp tappy

702.12 --> 711.72
because troll is a is a very it infers

707.64 --> 714.24
directly a whole bunch of specific types

711.72 --> 715.62
of behavior that are palpable and

714.24 --> 718.86
measurable

715.62 --> 721.98
and referenceable

718.86 --> 727.14
right and so when somebody's just really

721.98 --> 728.88
annoying really no no it's not that yeah

727.14 --> 730.86
that's not a troll that's just somebody

728.88 --> 733.14
getting on your nerves

730.86 --> 734.88
that's stupid they are around

733.14 --> 736.74
unfortunately

734.88 --> 740.36
but they're not a troll just because

736.74 --> 740.36
they're whiny and [ __ ]

744.36 --> 750.36
and hey to be fair

747.48 --> 753.24
it's an easy mistake to make

750.36 --> 755.399
I did that too but now

753.24 --> 756.839
my chat has turned around dramatically

755.399 --> 760.92
and there's just

756.839 --> 763.3800000000001
Global people here that are not trolls

760.92 --> 766.1999999999999
and I bet that all these guys in here

763.38 --> 769.2
that are are that including zap tapi

766.2 --> 771.5400000000001
probably has turned down the overall

769.2 --> 773.519
troll behavior that they would have on

771.54 --> 775.3199999999999
other platforms as well

773.519 --> 780.12
I'll bet that

775.32 --> 782.1600000000001
because now they have a stable footing a

780.12 --> 784.5600000000001
good code of conduct

782.16 --> 787.68
that they have to uphold here to

784.56 --> 788.8199999999999
reference to fall back on and it's much

787.68 --> 791.16
better

788.82 --> 794.3000000000001
to feel better about yourself because

791.16 --> 794.3
you're responsible

795.959 --> 801.1199999999999
I try to create order

799.019 --> 804.54
that's what I'm doing

801.12 --> 807.66
and some people are just not thankful

804.54 --> 810.56
for that at all

807.66 --> 810.56
foreign

811.579 --> 817.3199999999999
how dare you get in their way what on

815.22 --> 819.6600000000001
your freaking holy Crusade where you

817.32 --> 821.0400000000001
just attack people because they looked

819.66 --> 824.42
at you wrong

821.04 --> 824.42
[ __ ] is wrong with you man

824.459 --> 832.279
if you know consideration whatsoever as

827.339 --> 832.2790000000001
to how that makes you and us look

834.0 --> 839.76
right and I mean yeah I've been Ben

836.639 --> 842.7
hammery here in my channel right I mean

839.76 --> 843.959
fair enough but I'm the I'm the channel

842.7 --> 845.339
owner

843.959 --> 849.54
and

845.339 --> 851.1
and when I kind of overdo it I unban

849.54 --> 854.6999999999999
them

851.1 --> 857.22
yeah I correct it I never just uh throw

854.7 --> 860.6600000000001
you away never look again

857.22 --> 860.6600000000001
never even consider

863.88 --> 871.38
and I think I've like plenty rolled down

867.24 --> 874.88
just the amount of Bannings in general

871.38 --> 874.88
how many clovers come here

876.36 --> 882.48
well there's like at least like 10

879.18 --> 885.3199999999999
General chat goers that are globers that

882.48 --> 885.32
like to come here

885.86 --> 889.519
including you Aaron

893.399 --> 897.8
and zap tappy who's also here in chat

898.24 --> 901.429
[Music]

901.5 --> 906.72
right and the funny thing is sometimes I

903.899 --> 908.04
even forget it's like I just assume

906.72 --> 911.399
they're a flat Earth and they're like oh

908.04 --> 913.699
no wait I'm a glober like oh oh okay

911.399 --> 917.339
yeah miss Mr my mistake

913.699 --> 920.459
so I mean it doesn't even matter to me

917.339 --> 923.4590000000001
that much it's all about the behavior

920.459 --> 926.04
that's what it's really about

923.459 --> 930.5999999999999
and terrible Behavior

926.04 --> 933.199
can arise in both flat earthers and

930.6 --> 933.1990000000001
globers

933.959 --> 938.399
and even more prevalent in actual

936.36 --> 941.519
anti-flatter authors of course but

938.399 --> 943.079
that's a whole nother game one that I

941.519 --> 945.54
don't allow here

943.079 --> 947.76
and you guys know that you know how it

945.54 --> 951.139
works

947.76 --> 951.139
right no lying

952.56 --> 959.399
and no continual attacking of somebody's

957.18 --> 961.68
person

959.399 --> 963.66
because if you do that then you start to

961.68 --> 967.019
behave like a troll like an anti-flat

963.66 --> 969.86
earther like a vicious gamma back ankle

967.019 --> 969.86
biting gamma

971.77 --> 976.8
[Music]

973.86 --> 978.899
and you guys know that the globers in my

976.8 --> 982.459
chat know that

978.899 --> 982.459
and the flat earthers too

987.18 --> 989.3599999999999
foreign

994.94 --> 1000.8000000000001
er's profile pic apply

998.22 --> 1004.0400000000001
she's irrational now

1000.8 --> 1008.8599999999999
it's just a joke about pie

1004.04 --> 1008.86
it's just being a math nerd thingy

1011.62 --> 1017.0600000000001
or virtue signaling to math nerds at

1015.019 --> 1019.94
least

1017.06 --> 1023.4799999999999
that's what that tells me Jared

1019.94 --> 1025.22
but I mean her using that pie picture is

1023.48 --> 1026.78
really recognizable I mean you

1025.22 --> 1031.339
immediately don't know that's random

1026.78 --> 1033.9189999999999
because whatever has been using that

1031.339 --> 1036.74
picture since the start

1033.919 --> 1038.66
that's like eight years like ever it's

1036.74 --> 1041.74
always been that pie

1038.66 --> 1041.74
never changed it

1045.14 --> 1049.72
you can understand what Mile Square

1046.88 --> 1049.72
means of

1054.88 --> 1060.0800000000002
Brenda doesn't understand a whole bunch

1057.559 --> 1061.8799999999999
of things but she I will keep

1060.08 --> 1066.98
referencing it as she I don't know it

1061.88 --> 1069.679
just it's I don't want to think about it

1066.98 --> 1072.08
but she thinks she knows a lot more than

1069.679 --> 1075.039
she actually does she Bluffs and she

1072.08 --> 1075.039
knows she Bluffs

1075.14 --> 1079.72
I mean Brenda is a pretty devious person

1083.12 --> 1088.4189999999999
and if she hates you for some personal

1086.059 --> 1092.08
reason then she can be

1088.419 --> 1092.0800000000002
unbelievably vicious

1093.02 --> 1099.74
like as I would be as I was rage win

1097.28 --> 1102.2
but without the loudness

1099.74 --> 1103.94
and actually directed to a person

1102.2 --> 1108.22
mercilessly

1103.94 --> 1108.22
which I don't do

1110.78 --> 1115.46
it can be extremely mean and like

1113.179 --> 1117.679
threatened and all that

1115.46 --> 1121.72
she threatened people like oh send the

1117.679 --> 1121.72
FBI after you and it's that kind of [ __ ]

1126.2 --> 1131.74
or some other agency it's she's [ __ ]

1132.38 --> 1137.0590000000002
and by the way she never actually does

1134.539 --> 1141.039
that but she's like nasty enough to

1137.059 --> 1141.039
Bluff people with that sort of [ __ ]

1141.62 --> 1146.799
record is I don't bring that up please

1147.38 --> 1150.2800000000002
it's just

1150.679 --> 1155.799
Brenda is not worthy enough to be called

1153.26 --> 1155.799
he

1156.26 --> 1163.58
right if it's just some real dude

1159.799 --> 1166.34
oh my armatrons now for some reason are

1163.58 --> 1168.32
political or whatever or it's just I was

1166.34 --> 1170.36
foolish enough to be convinced that I

1168.32 --> 1172.82
should be like that and

1170.36 --> 1175.34
but they're actually really manly of

1172.82 --> 1177.6789999999999
manly but then I will call them he right

1175.34 --> 1180.6789999999999
but Brenda is not

1177.679 --> 1185.3200000000002
whatever that is and what it's become

1180.679 --> 1185.3200000000002
I'd refuse to call that a e okay

1190.039 --> 1194.72
so yeah

1191.299 --> 1197.179
that's right I'm calling Brenda a she

1194.72 --> 1200.72
because she's not worthy enough to

1197.179 --> 1202.16
actually be addressed by her actual sex

1200.72 --> 1205.64
that's right

1202.16 --> 1208.76
huh what are you gonna do about that

1205.64 --> 1212.8400000000001
say how dare you Arwin use the correct

1208.76 --> 1215.299
pronoun on somebody as an insult yeah

1212.84 --> 1218.6789999999999
what what you gonna do about that huh

1215.299 --> 1218.679
what you gonna do

1228.37 --> 1232.34
[Music]

1230.059 --> 1233.96
yeah how are you even gonna process that

1232.34 --> 1237.28
oh I don't know

1233.96 --> 1241.66
it's an insult but it's the right thing

1237.28 --> 1241.66
yeah I know I know that's what happens

1244.76 --> 1247.97
[Music]

1261.82 --> 1268.72
yeah no Tara don't don't over generalize

1265.58 --> 1268.72
like that please

1275.0 --> 1278.5
foreign

1276.44 --> 1281.63
to

1278.5 --> 1281.63
[Music]

1285.02 --> 1291.22
right well Terry if you want to call

1287.0 --> 1291.22
Brenda it that's your privilege

1291.26 --> 1297.3799999999999
I mean I refuse to even address her

1294.919 --> 1300.26
okay it's like

1297.38 --> 1302.7800000000002
I will address her like a passerby I

1300.26 --> 1305.78
will give her politeness courtesy but I

1302.78 --> 1308.539
do not want to engage in a conversation

1305.78 --> 1311.059
and it's like that makes me want to

1308.539 --> 1313.46
throw up very quickly

1311.059 --> 1316.94
like you address me and I'll literally

1313.46 --> 1319.64
get an Impulse of throwing up sometimes

1316.94 --> 1322.3400000000001
see I'm not even joking she is that

1319.64 --> 1324.679
repulsive to me like I have to actually

1322.34 --> 1327.1399999999999
erect some kind of spiritual Shield

1324.679 --> 1329.539
because she's so [ __ ] gross

1327.14 --> 1332.0
in so many ways it's unbelievable she's

1329.539 --> 1335.179
barely human to me

1332.0 --> 1338.78
her spirit is not

1335.179 --> 1340.96
not the way a human Spirit should be

1338.78 --> 1340.96
thank you

1341.0 --> 1347.0
and that's Glenn that looks like Greta

1343.88 --> 1350.179
sir well she wish it wishes I don't

1347.0 --> 1353.299
think this is gonna look that good

1350.179 --> 1355.1000000000001
and Greta is not unbelievably

1353.299 --> 1359.62
ugly or anything she just has this

1355.1 --> 1359.62
terrible attitude look on her

1360.44 --> 1365.3600000000001
I actually believe that Greta could one

1362.6 --> 1368.0
day completely turn around

1365.36 --> 1370.52
may sound really silly

1368.0 --> 1373.179
but I do I see things in people

1370.52 --> 1373.179
sometimes

1373.22 --> 1376.22
foreign

1378.34 --> 1385.4599999999998
spirit is real you see

1381.919 --> 1387.8600000000001
it's under control by Outsiders they're

1385.46 --> 1390.559
playing her but it's real though her

1387.86 --> 1393.02
outrage about things are real

1390.559 --> 1395.84
and so there will be a point where she's

1393.02 --> 1398.299
really gonna catch on like actually

1395.84 --> 1400.58
catch on the whole play and I think

1398.299 --> 1402.26
she's probably already there

1400.58 --> 1404.4189999999999
and when that happens you have two

1402.26 --> 1407.419
choices either you lose your soul and

1404.419 --> 1410.0590000000002
continue and then she loses the actual

1407.419 --> 1412.4
fire the the realness of her passion

1410.059 --> 1414.1399999999999
when she's doing it becomes just a bland

1412.4 --> 1417.6200000000001
actor like most of them

1414.14 --> 1420.38
or she'll actually Rebel

1417.62 --> 1422.539
and say like this sucks

1420.38 --> 1425.24
I wanted to make the environment better

1422.539 --> 1427.1589999999999
you're not doing that

1425.24 --> 1429.38
and I've already seen like articles

1427.159 --> 1431.5390000000002
where she would kind of like speak up

1429.38 --> 1433.8200000000002
like that a bit where she was like I

1431.539 --> 1438.64
don't like this

1433.82 --> 1438.6399999999999
or she's going slightly Off Script so

1439.7 --> 1443.78
yeah call me weird

1441.98 --> 1446.059
I think there might be something with

1443.78 --> 1448.46
Greta in the future

1446.059 --> 1451.0
even though she's really annoying right

1448.46 --> 1451.0
now still

1455.36 --> 1459.8799999999999
anyway

1456.919 --> 1459.88
how dare you

1461.299 --> 1465.5
yeah she made a complete cartoon of

1463.159 --> 1467.179
herself without with that speech

1465.5 --> 1470.26
[Music]

1467.179 --> 1472.94
worldwide meme

1470.26 --> 1475.58
but the thing is I do think that she

1472.94 --> 1476.9
just actually means it which made it

1475.58 --> 1480.26
really silly

1476.9 --> 1482.179
but you gotta understand she means the

1480.26 --> 1485.9
context of it she just doesn't really

1482.179 --> 1488.0590000000002
like the reality of how the things work

1485.9 --> 1489.919
but I think that her intent was probably

1488.059 --> 1491.84
always

1489.919 --> 1494.7800000000002
well meant

1491.84 --> 1498.08
although she might have been caught in

1494.78 --> 1500.059
like gross Eugenics type people that

1498.08 --> 1502.9399999999998
talk to her all the time so she's

1500.059 --> 1506.12
probably has been Afflicted with some

1502.94 --> 1509.8600000000001
Eugenics ideas but those conflict with

1506.12 --> 1509.86
inner rebellious Spirit really

1511.159 --> 1517.5200000000002
so she still has a chance spiritually I

1515.539 --> 1519.62
mean yeah maybe this is all completely

1517.52 --> 1522.08
alien to you guys what I'm saying right

1519.62 --> 1524.059
now but I really feel that

1522.08 --> 1528.5
there might be something but you'll see

1524.059 --> 1533.299
if Greta's gonna turn into a full

1528.5 --> 1535.64
full Sith Lord like that you will see it

1533.299 --> 1538.4
hasn't happened thus far I haven't seen

1535.64 --> 1540.0800000000002
it where it's like okay she's definitely

1538.4 --> 1543.3400000000001
never coming back

1540.08 --> 1543.34
haven't seen that yet

1544.58 --> 1549.62
she's still very young anyway

1547.34 --> 1552.82
hello Nathan Oakley thanks for sharing

1549.62 --> 1552.82
on Facebook okay

1557.84 --> 1565.8799999999999
very attractive woman was moving in

1561.74 --> 1567.86
six months ah yeah well that did happen

1565.88 --> 1570.44
but she also went away again there's

1567.86 --> 1573.26
another girl here now who's by the way

1570.44 --> 1575.72
he has a boyfriend also

1573.26 --> 1579.62
yeah

1575.72 --> 1581.539
but she is really nice I really like

1579.62 --> 1584.1789999999999
interacting with her

1581.539 --> 1586.64
she's a very

1584.179 --> 1589.7
she has a real female spirit

1586.64 --> 1592.5800000000002
and she like she likes strong guys so

1589.7 --> 1596.539
it's kind of connecting like that

1592.58 --> 1598.6399999999999
and absolutely nothing it like I'm

1596.539 --> 1601.22
keeping it purely gentlemanly of course

1598.64 --> 1604.2990000000002
again and she's like she really likes

1601.22 --> 1604.299
she appreciates me

1605.779 --> 1611.96
and she like very much is aware that I

1609.679 --> 1614.48
really do like

1611.96 --> 1617.02
clean up things that nobody else does

1614.48 --> 1617.02
and all that

1619.52 --> 1625.36
so in in a way she knows that I'm also

1622.22 --> 1629.84
taking care of her in the indirect sense

1625.36 --> 1634.84
and that's just like she has just

1629.84 --> 1634.84
I have pretty intense eye contact

1635.299 --> 1640.46
not that we staring at each other's eyes

1637.46 --> 1643.64
but it's just that she has really

1640.46 --> 1646.039
strong eyes with a lot of spirit kind of

1643.64 --> 1648.38
like me in a way but female and it's

1646.039 --> 1651.4
like it's just we have a chemistry that

1648.38 --> 1651.4
works really well together

1652.1 --> 1656.299
but not in a way that oh my God I'm so

1654.74 --> 1658.22
attracted or anything

1656.299 --> 1660.62
although I do find her kind of

1658.22 --> 1662.059
attractive and she probably thinks I'm

1660.62 --> 1663.799
kind of attracted but it doesn't really

1662.059 --> 1666.26
matter

1663.799 --> 1669.74
we're just we're getting along great so

1666.26 --> 1671.779
I'm really happy with the new roommate

1669.74 --> 1674.72
also getting along better with the other

1671.779 --> 1676.46
roommate that have been kind of bit

1674.72 --> 1678.14
distant to but she's like a very

1676.46 --> 1681.2
different type she's more a very

1678.14 --> 1684.3200000000002
introvert person very creative

1681.2 --> 1687.32
and she's just like a lot of times just

1684.32 --> 1689.12
staring like doing something staring

1687.32 --> 1690.799
into the distance thinking while with

1689.12 --> 1693.5
headphones on and then she's like

1690.799 --> 1695.24
doesn't even know that I'm walking in so

1693.5 --> 1697.1
it's a little bit different type of

1695.24 --> 1699.32
person but I'm getting along with her

1697.1 --> 1703.7199999999998
fine as well and she's actually really

1699.32 --> 1703.72
smart and creative like but she's smart

1703.88 --> 1708.5
she's good with words

1706.159 --> 1710.0590000000002
and Ken is good explainer so she's been

1708.5 --> 1711.62
even trying to explain some of the work

1710.059 --> 1714.76
that she's been doing

1711.62 --> 1714.76
with her education

1715.039 --> 1719.539
and it's interesting it's it's

1716.9 --> 1723.1000000000001
interesting to listen to so yeah I'm

1719.539 --> 1723.1
getting along with my roommates fine

1724.7 --> 1731.419
like even basically the the dust between

1727.58 --> 1734.6589999999999
me and the gay roommate guy has kind of

1731.419 --> 1736.5800000000002
settled apparently he was uh why do you

1734.659 --> 1738.14
say overworked

1736.58 --> 1741.1399999999999
he

1738.14 --> 1744.14
he had a burnout I didn't he didn't even

1741.14 --> 1747.0200000000002
tell me he didn't I didn't know that

1744.14 --> 1749.5
he had a burnout like in December

1747.02 --> 1749.5
apparently

1750.38 --> 1755.2990000000002
he didn't tell me I didn't know but he

1753.02 --> 1757.1589999999999
was acting really stressed out

1755.299 --> 1760.22
but I mean I didn't know what was going

1757.159 --> 1762.7990000000002
on but I heard it by over listening a

1760.22 --> 1766.1000000000001
conversation he had with the lamp with

1762.799 --> 1769.399
my landlord it's like okay

1766.1 --> 1770.539
I'm glad you never tell me anything this

1769.399 --> 1773.26
is

1770.539 --> 1773.26
uh

1780.799 --> 1786.94
come on zap tappy stop doing that and

1784.159 --> 1790.7600000000002

could be danger the little offerings

2258.64 --> 2262.14
when you start harassing them

2299.079 --> 2304.8590000000004
ashwagand there really I think there's

2301.3 --> 2304.8590000000004
already pretty Forte

2343.56 --> 2351.599

2351.76 --> 2357.599
it doesn't really go out of control

2408.22 --> 2411.8799999999997
can't I seem to be able to remember more

2410.38 --> 2414.76
things

2411.88 --> 2416.26
especially at the start I had like wow I

2414.76 --> 2419.079
didn't know my memory could work this

2416.26 --> 2421.42
well it was really weird although it has

2419.079 --> 2424.48
kind of

2421.42 --> 2426.52
yeah it's not that

2424.48 --> 2429.22
intense anymore

2426.52 --> 2431.56
which in a way I do regret

2429.22 --> 2433.72
I wish I would have that for for a long

2431.56 --> 2435.839
time but unfortunately it's not meant to

2433.72 --> 2435.839
be

2441.339 --> 2448.5
angry increases Pitta what

2445.599 --> 2448.5
foreign

2462.64 --> 2468.5789999999997
yeah well if yeah I mean if you're

2465.88 --> 2473.339
actually depressed then yes in

2468.579 --> 2473.3390000000004
johnsworth would work well I've tried it

2480.04 --> 2484.839
but I mean

2481.9 --> 2487.619
I'd only ever try that if I was actually

2484.839 --> 2487.619
depressed

2488.619 --> 2496.1800000000003
like drain from energy then yeah it it

2492.22 --> 2497.9199999999996
does actually work it's very doable to

2496.18 --> 2499.96
re-kick start you but you would actually

2497.92 --> 2501.88
have to take it you'd actually have to

2499.96 --> 2504.9
want to restart

2501.88 --> 2504.9
and then it works

2505.9 --> 2511.3
or at least it has for me in the past

2509.44 --> 2513.94
but people that are more typically

2511.3 --> 2514.8390000000004
chronically depressed it doesn't work on

2513.94 --> 2516.64
them

2514.839 --> 2518.74
when it's usually because there's a

2516.64 --> 2524.02
spiritual component to it

2518.74 --> 2525.64
that they just they refuse to try

2524.02 --> 2528.599
complicated

2525.64 --> 2528.5989999999997
psychological

2529.06 --> 2534.22
right there's no antidepressant you just

2532.119 --> 2537.46
shove it in the person they stop being

2534.22 --> 2541.18
depressed it's not how it works

2537.46 --> 2543.46
they have to actually want to stop it

2541.18 --> 2544.8999999999996
because it sounds really bizarre

2543.46 --> 2547.2400000000002
especially for an outsider but

2544.9 --> 2549.46
depression can be addictive

2547.24 --> 2551.2599999999998
not because it's pleasurable but because

2549.46 --> 2553.859
it's measurable and extremely

2551.26 --> 2553.8590000000004
predictable

2559.54 --> 2563.079
you can't force somebody to stop being

2561.579 --> 2565.6600000000003
depressed

2563.079 --> 2568.6600000000003
when they're addicted to it right these

2565.66 --> 2571.8999999999996
things are not outspoken but they are

2568.66 --> 2574.54
there it's what it is people don't just

2571.9 --> 2578.7000000000003
get addicted to positive emotions they

2574.54 --> 2578.7
also get addicted to misery

2580.54 --> 2586.06
it's just true it makes no logical sense

2584.079 --> 2588.04
except for

2586.06 --> 2589.7799999999997
if you approach it from a conditioning

2588.04 --> 2593.2599999999998
perspective and from

2589.78 --> 2595.0600000000004
all animals do what they're used to

2593.26 --> 2598.78
and if that what you're used to is

2595.06 --> 2603.7
misery then misery will feel like home

2598.78 --> 2603.7000000000003
it's it's literally true anyway

2622.5 --> 2625.619
oh okay

2632.56 --> 2638.04
I'm not aware of that sis I do know

2635.5 --> 2638.04
ayuveda

2638.079 --> 2643.3

2641.619 --> 2645.6400000000003

about it itself

2645.64 --> 2649.0
ayurveda

2647.02 --> 2650.5
you know very little in content about

2649.0 --> 2653.68
that

2650.5 --> 2657.22
I just know that I've been

2653.68 --> 2659.74
willing to trust it like for food

2657.22 --> 2662.319
and that I enjoyed that greatly

2659.74 --> 2663.64
and I've never had like wow I shouldn't

2662.319 --> 2665.44
have done that

2663.64 --> 2667.96
so

2665.44 --> 2671.099

about ayurveda

2684.88 --> 2687.88
foreign

2702.96 --> 2709.96
it's not with just one it's not just the

2706.48 --> 2714.42
other two components there's the will

2709.96 --> 2714.42
then there's the bodily influence right

2714.96 --> 2721.359
but your will can basically resign

2719.2 --> 2723.3999999999996
if you get addicted to the bodily

2721.359 --> 2724.48
influence you're just you'll just resign

2723.4 --> 2726.52
to it

2724.48 --> 2728.5
that's a choice and then it can be

2726.52 --> 2730.98
extremely difficult to overcome the mind

2728.5 --> 2734.5
in order to get the person to actually

2730.98 --> 2736.66
choose to stop doing that

2734.5 --> 2738.76
because their mind is under control of

2736.66 --> 2740.74
their addiction then

2738.76 --> 2745.3
and they don't even know that they're

2740.74 --> 2748.359
it's not logically identified

2745.3 --> 2750.3390000000004
by people they just don't understand why

2748.359 --> 2752.44
you're just so miserable oh they're so

2750.339 --> 2754.4

identify what's going on

2766.66 --> 2772.2999999999997
they're just really apt and making

2769.54 --> 2773.74
excuses for their condition for why

2772.3 --> 2775.96
things have to stay the way they are

2773.74 --> 2777.339
they don't realize that they're addicted

2775.96 --> 2780.339
to it

2777.339 --> 2780.339
foreign

2781.98 --> 2785.92
[Music]

2783.52 --> 2788.099
I know I can speak from experience with

2785.92 --> 2788.099
that

2808.78 --> 2810.96
thank you

2811.72 --> 2818.859
yeah yeah but zept happy just feeling

2814.96 --> 2821.02
depressed it's not the same thing

2818.859 --> 2822.339
everybody feels depressed about things

2821.02 --> 2824.2
sometimes

2822.339 --> 2827.859
it's not the same thing as actually

2824.2 --> 2832.2599999999998
dealing with like internal depression

2827.859 --> 2832.2599999999998
where it's really about your identity

2834.099 --> 2840.54
where it's more personal than just a

2836.619 --> 2840.54
situation making you feel bad okay

2840.819 --> 2846.579
what defines the actual depression is

2843.7 --> 2848.56
that it's a reoccurring thing and that

2846.579 --> 2850.32
it ruins

2848.56 --> 2852.2799999999997
things for you

2850.32 --> 2854.619
[Music]

2852.28 --> 2856.53
then it actually becomes depression and

2854.619 --> 2859.2400000000002
that's very different anyway

2856.53 --> 2862.8590000000004
[Music]

2859.24 --> 2862.859
not depression God

2866.06 --> 2871.2
[Music]

2868.42 --> 2871.2000000000003
okay

2871.96 --> 2877.54
right so there's not a lot of points

2874.72 --> 2878.7999999999997
you're too bickering about it then since

2877.54 --> 2882.24
you're both

2878.8 --> 2882.2400000000002
have experience with it

2883.0 --> 2886.2
right anyway

2890.94 --> 2896.28
some blue sky

2893.859 --> 2896.2799999999997
well

2896.319 --> 2899.319
nice

2903.22 --> 2908.4599999999996
smoke too much to have depression okay

2911.52 --> 2914.64
alrighty then

2917.38 --> 2920.2000000000003
but my life what was the happiest period

2919.18 --> 2922.4199999999996
in my life

2920.2 --> 2924.16
well that's a trick question

2922.42 --> 2925.839
because there were plenty of times where

2924.16 --> 2928.0
I definitely felt like it was the

2925.839 --> 2930.16
happiest time of the life but when I

2928.0 --> 2933.48
look at it now

2930.16 --> 2933.48
it's all tainted

2943.8 --> 2949.54
but on average like when I'm with a

2947.44 --> 2950.7400000000002
girlfriend that I'm actually really in

2949.54 --> 2953.44
love with

2950.74 --> 2956.2599999999998
like the first year of my ex

2953.44 --> 2958.18
that dude you cannot imagine how

2956.26 --> 2961.0600000000004
freaking ecstatic I am when I'm like

2958.18 --> 2964.44
that like it's hard to actually Express

2961.06 --> 2964.44
how intensely

2964.54 --> 2970.96
riveting that is to me

2967.839 --> 2973.96
so yeah I could probably say the most

2970.96 --> 2974.859
intense Joy I've ever felt was in times

2973.96 --> 2977.76
of

2974.859 --> 2977.7599999999998
relationship

2984.579 --> 2991.38
only to be evened out by the extreme

2988.599 --> 2991.38
dread

2991.9 --> 2998.619
and pain that happens when that's over

2996.76 --> 3000.619
right so

2998.619 --> 3000.619
um

3009.079 --> 3012.5600000000004
on the other hand

3013.319 --> 3017.7599999999998
in times where I've been like really in

3015.96 --> 3019.98
a creative flow

3017.76 --> 3021.42
like for example in certain periods when

3019.98 --> 3023.96
I was making my Dungeons and Dragons

3021.42 --> 3028.7400000000002
book trolls and tyrants

3023.96 --> 3033.02
those are pretty damn ecstatic as well

3028.74 --> 3033.02
I mean I really love doing that

3033.06 --> 3038.88
problem with my book is is that

3036.06 --> 3042.0
it's done

3038.88 --> 3044.46
I mean anything I add on top on onto it

3042.0 --> 3047.339
will just like kind of drape off because

3044.46 --> 3050.16
it's there's nothing more to improve

3047.339 --> 3053.22
about it

3050.16 --> 3054.74
I've worked for over a decade on it on a

3053.22 --> 3057.4199999999996
daily basis

3054.74 --> 3059.7
there's really nothing more I can

3057.42 --> 3062.04
improve about it

3059.7 --> 3063.98
the only alternative would be to

3062.04 --> 3067.5
completely

3063.98 --> 3069.48
rearrange everything once again

3067.5 --> 3073.76
and I don't feel like it at all because

3069.48 --> 3073.76
I think it's very efficient right now

3073.8 --> 3081.54
but yeah in Creative processes

3077.28 --> 3084.0
been very feels great

3081.54 --> 3087.7799999999997
but I mean when I'm actually in love the

3084.0 --> 3090.54
way I feel when when that works

3087.78 --> 3093.599
and like your girlfriend is actually

3090.54 --> 3096.859
like being your partner and you're like

3093.599 --> 3101.48
a team I I cannot describe how

3096.859 --> 3101.48
unbelievably ecstatic that is to be

3103.319 --> 3108.18
I mean that feels makes me feel so great

3105.599 --> 3111.3590000000004
that sometimes it sounds really silly

3108.18 --> 3113.52
that sometimes I just have to like go

3111.359 --> 3117.2
around in another room just to cry for a

3113.52 --> 3117.2
bit because it's just too much

3126.0 --> 3130.619
but yeah that intensity usually

3128.339 --> 3133.2
eventually wears off a bit and then it's

3130.619 --> 3135.78
just extremely comfortable and reliable

3133.2 --> 3139.16
and it feels strong and

3135.78 --> 3139.1600000000003
they're like it could do anything

3139.38 --> 3146.2200000000003
and that usually lasts the problem's

3142.319 --> 3149.46
always been that my girlfriend it

3146.22 --> 3150.5989999999997
doesn't last with them and I just don't

3149.46 --> 3153.9
understand

3150.599 --> 3156.059
I don't understand why except for well I

3153.9 --> 3161.2200000000003
have weaknesses I've done stupid things

3156.059 --> 3163.8
but I'm always very like

3161.22 --> 3166.02
have humility towards that and try to

3163.8 --> 3168.96
correct really and never like I don't

3166.02 --> 3172.2
make issues in that sense I'm like a cop

3168.96 --> 3176.0
but I'm a [ __ ] for love like for actual

3172.2 --> 3176.0
love for the spirit connection

3176.52 --> 3181.68
and if the if my girlfriend would just

3180.54 --> 3184.8
start to

3181.68 --> 3186.4199999999996
kind of push me around with that then it

3184.8 --> 3190.099
becomes unreliable and I have to

3186.42 --> 3190.099
disconnect which is very miserable

3194.76 --> 3200.0400000000004
and that happened with my ex and I held

3197.819 --> 3201.54
on for like two years after that even

3200.04 --> 3203.819
happened

3201.54 --> 3205.74
she started to disconnect and I'm like I

3203.819 --> 3207.66
don't want to lose you I really really

3205.74 --> 3209.64
don't and then in the end like she

3207.66 --> 3212.22
really didn't care

3209.64 --> 3214.2599999999998
foreign

3212.22 --> 3216.98
and I don't know how to deal with that

3214.26 --> 3216.98
at all

3217.44 --> 3221.76
because once I really fall in love with

3219.54 --> 3224.7599999999998
the girl it doesn't stop

3221.76 --> 3227.7000000000003
I mean the first initial Overkill

3224.76 --> 3230.4
hormone burst that stops thank God

3227.7 --> 3233.339
because that literally makes me sick in

3230.4 --> 3236.1600000000003
how intense it is

3233.339 --> 3238.859
like when I fall in love

3236.16 --> 3241.14
I go like Stan well not Lich I don't

3238.859 --> 3242.7599999999998
puke in their faces but I do get like

3241.14 --> 3245.04
really sick

3242.76 --> 3247.8590000000004
from it the initial

3245.04 --> 3249.54
period right but then once like after

3247.859 --> 3252.24
like the first

3249.54 --> 3254.88
month or two three

3252.24 --> 3256.859
then it becomes tenable to me then

3254.88 --> 3260.099
actually it's like oh the sickness is

3256.859 --> 3262.94
going away and then it's like yeah

3260.099 --> 3262.94
full power

3263.52 --> 3268.28
is basically after the in love period

3268.74 --> 3277.0989999999997
because my in love is just Overkill

3272.64 --> 3280.92
so for me falling or the initial

3277.099 --> 3282.059
hormones wearing off makes it livable to

3280.92 --> 3285.059
me

3282.059 --> 3285.059
laughs

3285.75 --> 3294.139
[Music]

3299.52 --> 3303.9
right because I'm the type I fall in

3301.92 --> 3305.76
love and then I'm so in love that I'm

3303.9 --> 3308.819
literally sick of it

3305.76 --> 3312.119
I'm that just because like I'm so

3308.819 --> 3315.619
[ __ ] in love I can't stop having

3312.119 --> 3315.619
that image in my head

3317.28 --> 3321.7200000000003
I've had that quite a few times by the

3319.68 --> 3325.3999999999996
way as a teen

3321.72 --> 3325.3999999999996
with very little success

3332.66 --> 3339.0
because I just get sick and then I

3336.18 --> 3340.2
didn't know how to compose myself

3339.0 --> 3342.599
anyway

3340.2 --> 3345.8999999999996
that did change definitely

3342.599 --> 3348.54
like in the later teens

3345.9 --> 3351.6800000000003
when I realized like yeah maybe I just

3348.54 --> 3351.68
shouldn't be in love

3352.92 --> 3357.559
it's more important that they're in love

3355.2 --> 3357.5589999999997
with me

3361.319 --> 3367.319
but then I end up being the party that

3364.14 --> 3370.44
just doesn't really care too much and

3367.319 --> 3372.42
that's not fair to my girls that would

3370.44 --> 3374.09
fall in love with me and so then I kind

3372.42 --> 3376.559
of stopped doing that too

3374.09 --> 3378.9
[Music]

3376.559 --> 3382.02
and then I bumped into my ax which was

3378.9 --> 3385.26
like mind-blowing to me I didn't believe

3382.02 --> 3387.8
that somebody like that could exist

3385.26 --> 3387.8
anyway

3391.68 --> 3395.66
what are you guys bickering about

3396.48 --> 3400.44
the truth about Fe bring me lots of

3399.24 --> 3403.16
happiness

3400.44 --> 3403.16
no

3404.579 --> 3411.0
no not at all

3407.339 --> 3414.0789999999997
but it's a great relief

3411.0 --> 3414.079
for my mind

3417.54 --> 3426.839
it's very helpful to survive spiritually

3421.98 --> 3430.14
and mentally to really know what's what

3426.839 --> 3432.0589999999997
to not be able to have that mystery and

3430.14 --> 3434.2799999999997
just like I don't know so whatever

3432.059 --> 3436.1400000000003
somebody's could be telling me about it

3434.28 --> 3438.7200000000003
might be right

3436.14 --> 3441.5989999999997
like I know now I can differentiate with

3438.72 --> 3443.2799999999997
that I know now what is what I know now

3441.599 --> 3444.48
when somebody's bullshitting and when

3443.28 --> 3447.9
they aren't

3444.48 --> 3451.559
before Flat Earth I didn't know

3447.9 --> 3456.1800000000003
it was a mystery but I would be playable

3451.559 --> 3460.1600000000003
because of it now I can't be played it

3456.18 --> 3460.16
doesn't work anymore I know too much

3462.0 --> 3467.7
so does Effie bring me happiness no but

3464.76 --> 3470.599
it did bring me

3467.7 --> 3470.5989999999997
stability

3476.579 --> 3480.3
yeah

3478.02 --> 3483.48
oddly enough stability

3480.3 --> 3486.2400000000002
in my mind inside but I mean social

3483.48 --> 3490.44
life-wise yeah it created more distance

3486.24 --> 3492.839
but I mean I've been I've had been I've

3490.44 --> 3495.96
have been creating distances between me

3492.839 --> 3499.0789999999997
and Society for a while before that even

3495.96 --> 3501.559
I mean 911 definitely created distance

3499.079 --> 3505.559
just the overall recognition that

3501.559 --> 3509.78
official truth about events are lies

3505.559 --> 3509.78
was already creating quite a rift

3510.599 --> 3515.94
so to me Flat Earth has not done that

3513.599 --> 3520.38
much damage because I wasn't like at the

3515.94 --> 3523.079
time in a widespread social community

3520.38 --> 3524.1600000000003
that then break broke with me because of

3523.079 --> 3526.98
it

3524.16 --> 3530.1189999999997
I mean I had like

3526.98 --> 3530.119
yeah I had

3530.22 --> 3536.24
one couple of friends that broke with me

3533.579 --> 3536.2400000000002
because of it

3536.88 --> 3541.559
right the other was not because of Flat

3538.98 --> 3543.599
Earth oh no it was actually so yeah I

3541.559 --> 3546.42
guess that three of my old Remnant

3543.599 --> 3547.799
friends which were like the rat the last

3546.42 --> 3550.799
of it

3547.799 --> 3554.579
they broke with me over Flat Earth

3550.799 --> 3556.38
and it seemed absolutely insane to me

3554.579 --> 3558.1800000000003
that they did that

3556.38 --> 3560.28
like I was just like

3558.18 --> 3562.98
can't be serious

3560.28 --> 3565.2000000000003
it's like it's just an idea you

3562.98 --> 3566.819
entertain any kind of nonsense idea and

3565.2 --> 3569.22
you're just staring at like Ah that's

3566.819 --> 3573.0
just silly or whatever just Folly

3569.22 --> 3576.2599999999998
entertaining why is this enough to say I

3573.0 --> 3576.26
never want to see you again

3582.059 --> 3588.5400000000004
the robots they didn't say that it just

3585.48 --> 3590.46
suddenly everything changed around I got

3588.54 --> 3593.16
threatened over it

3590.46 --> 3596.52
bring it by bringing it up

3593.16 --> 3599.46
they were like genuinely scared

3596.52 --> 3602.7
of it genuinely scared

3599.46 --> 3605.2200000000003
like suddenly some fear overcame it's

3602.7 --> 3607.46
really weird at the time was really

3605.22 --> 3607.4599999999996
weird

3607.68 --> 3612.0589999999997
but yeah I did not have like hundreds of

3610.14 --> 3613.799
people that I hung around that suddenly

3612.059 --> 3616.5
were like oh my God what has happened to

3613.799 --> 3618.9
him he's got my flat earther oh no no I

3616.5 --> 3620.28
had like three thin friends and they're

3618.9 --> 3624.14
just

3620.28 --> 3624.1400000000003
they hooked off that's it

3640.74 --> 3644.9399999999996
what's going on here

3642.54 --> 3647.099
load Den is real

3644.94 --> 3650.42
hi

3647.099 --> 3650.42
what are you doing here

3650.46 --> 3653.819
were you bickering with people in my

3652.44 --> 3656.599
chat

3653.819 --> 3656.599
foreign

3685.619 --> 3690.1800000000003
the more you educate yourself the less

3687.599 --> 3692.88
you're confident you hold your claims

3690.18 --> 3696.0
well that's good

3692.88 --> 3698.119
because then you'll realize how Loosely

3696.0 --> 3701.04
founded a lot of the knowledge

3698.119 --> 3704.6400000000003
mainstream knowledge really is

3701.04 --> 3707.22
so that's a good attitude to have yeah

3704.64 --> 3708.5989999999997
we don't have that problem with flat

3707.22 --> 3711.4199999999996
Earth though

3708.599 --> 3713.1600000000003
because the evidence is Rife it's there

3711.42 --> 3716.16
for the picking it's straight in your

3713.16 --> 3717.96
face the only reason it's not being

3716.16 --> 3722.839
picked up on this is because it's being

3717.96 --> 3726.42
actively ignored and rerouted with crazy

3722.839 --> 3730.319
unproven arguments

3726.42 --> 3731.52
like terrestrial refraction

3730.319 --> 3734.46
right

3731.52 --> 3736.68
or gravity being the container those

3734.46 --> 3741.619
types of arguments is what we get

3736.68 --> 3741.6189999999997
against it and it makes it doesn't work

3742.38 --> 3749.7000000000003
so we get the confidence concerning Flat

3746.46 --> 3752.18
Earth from the actual arguments

3749.7 --> 3752.18
themselves

3774.619 --> 3780.119
all right yeah that's good point there

3777.48 --> 3783.18
you have to educate yourself you can't

3780.119 --> 3784.859
just be educated by others you have to

3783.18 --> 3788.0989999999997
do it yourself you're the one that's

3784.859 --> 3791.24
going to have to take the wheel the helm

3788.099 --> 3791.2400000000002
and decide

3792.66 --> 3797.64
can't just have other people tell you

3794.76 --> 3799.5
how to think doesn't work

3797.64 --> 3801.74
then you don't have any will to do

3799.5 --> 3801.74
anything

3802.98 --> 3805.579
okay

3805.88 --> 3810.26
I'm not bickering okay fine

3810.53 --> 3813.739
[Music]

3826.02 --> 3830.339
you could do everything yourself yeah

3828.24 --> 3833.3999999999996
but you can figure out

3830.339 --> 3834.859
what is what and realize oh wait these

3833.4 --> 3838.559
people are now

3834.859 --> 3840.359
really concerned about some stupid meta

3838.559 --> 3842.88
nonsense

3840.359 --> 3845.7599999999998
about something that is clearly

3842.88 --> 3847.799
presupposed and not actually has

3845.76 --> 3851.099
physical evidence to back it just some

3847.799 --> 3853.74
vague mathematical inference yeah you

3851.099 --> 3855.54
can definitely figure that out and

3853.74 --> 3857.819
realize like yeah oh they're so

3855.54 --> 3859.92
concerned about this little math detail

3857.819 --> 3861.7799999999997
about something that's complete nonsense

3859.92 --> 3864.839
and unproven

3861.78 --> 3865.8590000000004
and that that is actually happening a

3864.839 --> 3869.339
lot

3865.859 --> 3871.319
in the Science World and at universities

3869.339 --> 3875.22
and all that yeah

3871.319 --> 3877.5589999999997
people squirting on with math about some

3875.22 --> 3880.2599999999998
details and philosophy surrounding that

3877.559 --> 3883.079
about things that are all pre-assumed

3880.26 --> 3885.78
in many many things it's like all the

3883.079 --> 3888.2400000000002
preponderance of this pre-assembed work

3885.78 --> 3891.48
will somehow make it cohesive and then

3888.24 --> 3893.0989999999997
we can find this logical derived formula

3891.48 --> 3896.339
from all these pre-assumed little

3893.099 --> 3898.6800000000003
details and then that's what's going on

3896.339 --> 3900.24
a lot out there there's very little

3898.68 --> 3902.24
physical

3900.24 --> 3905.819
proven things

3902.24 --> 3908.24
that scientists concern themselves with

3905.819 --> 3908.24
these days

3910.71 --> 3913.7490000000003
[Music]

3927.44 --> 3930.78
[Music]

3928.98 --> 3933.96
where do globers get their information

3930.78 --> 3935.8190000000004
from well from the globe propagandists

3933.96 --> 3938.76
which can be anti-flat earthers from

3935.819 --> 3941.16
people that gets really want everybody

3938.76 --> 3943.619
to believe it

3941.16 --> 3945.0
and they will come to you so somebody's

3943.619 --> 3947.46
on the scene like oh I want to know

3945.0 --> 3950.579
about this flat earth like it's a bow

3947.46 --> 3953.04
right but like how what do I say and

3950.579 --> 3955.26
guess what all the anti-flighters like

3953.04 --> 3957.839
oh yes oh please oh we know everything

3955.26 --> 3960.1800000000003
oh just follow this Playbook and here's

3957.839 --> 3962.46
the guy you want to listen to how he

3960.18 --> 3964.5589999999997
said it uh this is how you become an

3962.46 --> 3966.66
anti-flatter and that's how a lot of

3964.559 --> 3968.4
people that just go on the scene like oh

3966.66 --> 3970.2599999999998
I'm gonna go against that's why they

3968.4 --> 3972.359
always end up sounding like anti-flat

3970.26 --> 3974.0
earthers because they've all been

3972.359 --> 3977.16
coached

3974.0 --> 3980.7
by anti-flat Earth there's because those

3977.16 --> 3984.48
guys go straight at it and like give you

3980.7 --> 3986.7
everything that you could ever use

3984.48 --> 3990.359
because they're desperate for people to

3986.7 --> 3994.5
come on the scene and do their research

3990.359 --> 3996.0
like utilize their anti-flat Earth

3994.5 --> 3998.099
research

3996.0 --> 3999.9
they're [ __ ] machinations the things

3998.099 --> 4001.88
that aren't even officially claimed but

3999.9 --> 4003.38
still can be used as an argument so

4001.88 --> 4006.46
that's what they give to you they

4003.38 --> 4010.1600000000003
basically pile on a giant supply of

4006.46 --> 4013.099
Weaponry arguments that you could use as

4010.16 --> 4015.0789999999997
a baller while you don't know anything

4013.099 --> 4016.819
about it you didn't have any training

4015.079 --> 4019.039
with any of it you don't even know how

4016.819 --> 4020.299
those things came to be so you're just

4019.039 --> 4023.119
echoing

4020.299 --> 4025.819
like a speaking Point not actually

4023.119 --> 4028.039
knowing what it all means and that's

4025.819 --> 4030.319
what happens a lot now

4028.039 --> 4033.26
yeah a new guy comes on the scene ball

4030.319 --> 4035.24
Defender rolling out typical anti-flat

4033.26 --> 4037.6400000000003
Earth arguments not actually

4035.24 --> 4039.68
interactively being able to explain any

4037.64 --> 4040.94
of it because they don't understand what

4039.68 --> 4044.299
they're saying because they've been

4040.94 --> 4046.579
coached by anti-flat earthers this is

4044.299 --> 4048.44
the material you need to use

4046.579 --> 4050.599
and they don't even understand the

4048.44 --> 4051.98
history of the reasoning of all any of

4050.599 --> 4054.5
that

4051.98 --> 4056.359
so they literally roll out anti-flat

4054.5 --> 4058.819
Earth or speaking points not knowing

4056.359 --> 4061.7599999999998
what it even means

4058.819 --> 4063.92
just barely able to hold on to it in

4061.76 --> 4066.2000000000003
their mind to roll it out as a somewhat

4063.92 --> 4070.299
cohesive sentence right that's what's

4066.2 --> 4070.299
happening out there now a lot

4070.339 --> 4076.099
anti-flat Arthur coaches

4073.22 --> 4077.839
jump onto new globers that want to go

4076.099 --> 4080.059
against Flat Earth and hand them all

4077.839 --> 4082.16
their [ __ ] they use it

4080.059 --> 4083.9
I think they're all smart but they

4082.16 --> 4085.2799999999997
literally don't understand the material

4083.9 --> 4087.319
that they're using they don't understand

4085.28 --> 4090.799
the logic or the history of any of it

4087.319 --> 4093.68
that's what's happening now a lot it's

4090.799 --> 4095.359
been happening for years now

4093.68 --> 4097.58
like a couple of years that's

4095.359 --> 4099.739
continually happens somebody news comes

4097.58 --> 4101.359
on the scene immediately anti-flat Earth

4099.739 --> 4103.639999999999
arguments

4101.359 --> 4105.38
and they don't understand it they don't

4103.64 --> 4108.7390000000005
actually talk about the arguments they

4105.38 --> 4110.900000000001
just roll it out and move on

4108.739 --> 4113.299
never go into the details because they

4110.9 --> 4116.62
don't understand what they just mimicked

4113.299 --> 4116.62
what they just roll out

4118.219 --> 4120.759
right

4122.0 --> 4128.179
I mean the anti-flat earthers themselves

4125.0 --> 4130.279
that give all that advice to the newbies

4128.179 --> 4132.679
that come on the scene

4130.279 --> 4135.799000000001
when you put them on the spot they can't

4132.679 --> 4137.6
even properly explain their train of

4135.799 --> 4138.92
thought and reasoning behind their

4137.6 --> 4141.859
arguments

4138.92 --> 4143.6
so yeah how would you ever expect a day

4141.859 --> 4145.759
the instructors don't even understand

4143.6 --> 4148.279
what they're doing

4145.759 --> 4150.199
and how it doesn't work they don't even

4148.279 --> 4153.38
know yeah what do you think that those

4150.199 --> 4156.3189999999995
newly informed people they will not know

4153.38 --> 4159.38
anything about it they'll just be like I

4156.319 --> 4163.46
don't know I don't understand let me ask

4159.38 --> 4168.56
around I don't know because they don't

4163.46 --> 4171.859
they're just echoing their instructions

4168.56 --> 4176.299
given to them by people that really

4171.859 --> 4179.299
don't even understand like the logic

4176.299 --> 4181.839
of their arguments that they've

4179.299 --> 4181.839
constructed

4189.04 --> 4192.64
what is going on

4203.6 --> 4206.679
hello tensor

4210.98 --> 4217.699
yeah that's really nice dinosaur yeah

4213.44 --> 4220.5199999999995
but video games is part of my potential

4217.699 --> 4221.719
future profession and dude I've been

4220.52 --> 4224.120000000001
active

4221.719 --> 4227.179
yeah yeah

4224.12 --> 4229.82
I've been making notes for a script for

4227.179 --> 4232.54
the video game that I had a vision about

4229.82 --> 4232.54
yeah

4234.56 --> 4240.8
and it's really manifesting I mean I'm

4237.86 --> 4243.58
literally seeing a real Baldur's guide 3

4240.8 --> 4243.58
in my mind

4246.92 --> 4254.179
I I really am like starting to like it's

4250.52 --> 4256.159000000001
getting more expensive extensive it

4254.179 --> 4259.9400000000005
would actually become an actual script

4256.159 --> 4263.78
that did and dude this one could become

4259.94 --> 4266.0199999999995
really [ __ ] huge

4263.78 --> 4272.42
as in

4266.02 --> 4275.360000000001
very extensive storyline very long like

4272.42 --> 4277.52
it could potentially

4275.36 --> 4279.38
it could doesn't mean that it would

4277.52 --> 4282.14
eventually happen but it could be as big

4279.38 --> 4287.06
as like Baldur's Gate one one and a half

4282.14 --> 4290.84
and two and the extension all combined

4287.06 --> 4293.06
but as a continuation of that entire

4290.84 --> 4295.82
thing so it would be very different but

4293.06 --> 4298.219
it's all about the Realms and the

4295.82 --> 4301.099999999999
deities and the balance between them and

4298.219 --> 4303.92
like what happens after the Throne of

4301.1 --> 4307.6
Baal had been retaken I mean I've I've

4303.92 --> 4307.6
read it I've written it down

4307.78 --> 4313.219
it could be a real video game that's

4311.12 --> 4314.84
actually a continuation of that original

4313.219 --> 4317.179
Saga

4314.84 --> 4320.54
and like as good as you would have

4317.179 --> 4321.9800000000005
imagined it the continuation to be back

4320.54 --> 4325.3
then

4321.98 --> 4325.299999999999
it can be done

4326.84 --> 4331.64
RPG yeah

4329.54 --> 4333.739
well it would become something else

4331.64 --> 4336.4400000000005
because it's not just an RPG anymore

4333.739 --> 4338.599999999999
it's not just an adventure RPG

4336.44 --> 4341.659
which was really the the standard

4338.6 --> 4344.120000000001
setting for the original trilogy but I

4341.659 --> 4347.239
mean you become a deity so it's not just

4344.12 --> 4351.4
an RPG anymore

4347.239 --> 4351.4
it becomes more like a complex

4351.76 --> 4357.9800000000005
strategy game I mean it's a strategy

4355.04 --> 4362.179
game with the freaking deities of DnD

4357.98 --> 4364.699
that's basically what it would become

4362.179 --> 4368.2390000000005
and that you're actually like trying to

4364.699 --> 4369.739
attain a position in the pantheon you

4368.239 --> 4372.678999999999
would like one of the first things would

4369.739 --> 4375.86
be like you have to go to other Realms

4372.679 --> 4377.659
and like reclaim lands from the devils

4375.86 --> 4380.78
and demons that have taken it up because

4377.659 --> 4382.82
no deity would take lay claim to it

4380.78 --> 4385.58
because they were preoccupied with war

4382.82 --> 4387.92
with each other in the time of troubles

4385.58 --> 4390.26
which is what preceded

4387.92 --> 4393.679
the ball there's gay in the history of

4390.26 --> 4396.26
it what created it right so this is a

4393.679 --> 4401.14
complex big storyline thing and it's

4396.26 --> 4401.14
working I've got an idea I can see it

4407.26 --> 4412.1
prioritizing my time designing dude what

4410.239 --> 4414.199
do you think I do I'm not just playing

4412.1 --> 4417.7390000000005
through the video game over and over and

4414.199 --> 4419.919999999999
over again just I'm always thinking and

4417.739 --> 4424.94
listening and just trying to figure out

4419.92 --> 4427.1
what gave me that squirt what made it so

4424.94 --> 4431.48
[ __ ] awesome

4427.1 --> 4432.76
what keeps you bound to it why was it so

4431.48 --> 4435.259999999999
intensely

4432.76 --> 4439.46
exciting to me

4435.26 --> 4442.52
and I'm like how do you continuate this

4439.46 --> 4445.28
so I've been playing it with that in

4442.52 --> 4447.7390000000005
mind because I'm always have been

4445.28 --> 4450.38
playing that in mind I was always like

4447.739 --> 4453.139999999999
why doesn't this game continue and then

4450.38 --> 4455.36
Ballers Gate 3 came on I'm like whoa is

4453.14 --> 4458.42
it actually boss gets the holy [ __ ] uh

4455.36 --> 4460.219
uh and then yeah I bought it thanks to

4458.42 --> 4462.1990000000005
so your guy's support

4460.219 --> 4464.4800000000005
and then it turned out to be complete

4462.199 --> 4466.699
[ __ ] as in oh this is a pretty

4464.48 --> 4470.0
interesting continuation

4466.699 --> 4471.919999999999
of never winter nights like what the

4470.0 --> 4475.58
[ __ ] does that game have to do anything

4471.92 --> 4478.6990000000005
with baller's gate whatsoever nothing

4475.58 --> 4481.219
it's not even the same character in the

4478.699 --> 4483.759999999999
story it's [ __ ]

4481.219 --> 4483.76
anyway

4484.46 --> 4491.12
so yeah I'm just like no this that

4487.699 --> 4494.178999999999
bullish gate can be continued

4491.12 --> 4495.92
we can have a continuation

4494.179 --> 4499.9400000000005
that doable

4495.92 --> 4504.26
it is very doable now

4499.94 --> 4507.259999999999
and it can be really awesome there's so

4504.26 --> 4510.92
much Dungeons and Dragons lore and even

4507.26 --> 4513.56
like art even just the art and the art

4510.92 --> 4516.82
ideas for the other planes

4513.56 --> 4520.580000000001
there's so much developed material

4516.82 --> 4522.86
culture to basically just put it

4520.58 --> 4525.739
together so you don't have to make

4522.86 --> 4528.259999999999
everything up from scratch like some new

4525.739 --> 4531.139999999999
Total new imagination no you just have

4528.26 --> 4534.62
to use what's already there and then

4531.14 --> 4537.679
make a very relatable and logically

4534.62 --> 4540.8
consistent with the lore of DnD story

4537.679 --> 4544.58
within it that involves deities there's

4540.8 --> 4548.320000000001
literal DND books about deities okay

4544.58 --> 4548.32
it's a developed thing

4548.719 --> 4556.84
you can do something with it

4553.04 --> 4558.56
and actually have make it

4556.84 --> 4563.3
purposeful

4558.56 --> 4566.080000000001
and logical and in a way that puts it

4563.3 --> 4566.08
all together

4572.12 --> 4575.62
I intend to do that

4577.52 --> 4582.92
now I'm not there yet tensor what the

4580.1 --> 4586.52
[ __ ] I've never produced a video game

4582.92 --> 4587.9800000000005
ever I'm just a designer

4586.52 --> 4591.38
I have

4587.98 --> 4593.9
designs I'm not a programmer I'm not an

4591.38 --> 4596.4800000000005
organizer I couldn't even get the rights

4593.9 --> 4599.78
right dude if this game

4596.48 --> 4602.299999999999
would be it would be such a freaking

4599.78 --> 4606.92
expensive project because it would

4602.3 --> 4609.860000000001
require actual real talent

4606.92 --> 4612.08
you would have to have really good voice

4609.86 --> 4614.239
actors you would have to have

4612.08 --> 4615.94
well basically the same guy that made

4614.239 --> 4619.82
the original music

4615.94 --> 4622.5199999999995
and have them as inspired as they were

4619.82 --> 4624.739
with the original music

4622.52 --> 4626.42
which is like I don't even know if that

4624.739 --> 4628.699
can be accompli I don't even know if the

4626.42 --> 4630.26
guy is still alive I hope so

4628.699 --> 4633.5
right I mean

4630.26 --> 4639.26
this is like a masterpiece thing I am

4633.5 --> 4639.26
not a a game developer professionally

4640.04 --> 4643.94
so it's a really nice oh yeah this is

4642.679 --> 4646.46
how are you gonna roll it I don't

4643.94 --> 4648.5
[ __ ] know dude I'm not even close to

4646.46 --> 4652.659
knowing how that works

4648.5 --> 4652.659
I'm just about that game

4652.699 --> 4657.799999999999
I'm just about the game about the script

4655.04 --> 4659.48
about roughly how I think it should be

4657.8 --> 4663.4400000000005
created

4659.48 --> 4666.739
which would be a big roll back from oh

4663.44 --> 4668.659
we have to have the latest CGI [ __ ] your

4666.739 --> 4672.44
latest CGI how about that how about you

4668.659 --> 4675.98
go [ __ ] your latest CGI up the ass until

4672.44 --> 4680.239
it dies and we can just have a good game

4675.98 --> 4684.139999999999
instead of the word is CGI [ __ ] you yeah

4680.239 --> 4685.759999999999
how about a really [ __ ] awesome new

4684.14 --> 4689.0
game

4685.76 --> 4692.84
new game that's really awesome that can

4689.0 --> 4695.719
even play on all their computers ah how

4692.84 --> 4699.6990000000005
about that huh

4695.719 --> 4699.699
that's gonna be my strategy

4702.8 --> 4707.900000000001
it's going to save a ton of money

4705.44 --> 4711.199
and all that money can then be used to

4707.9 --> 4712.759999999999
get the actual best voice actors in the

4711.199 --> 4715.699
world

4712.76 --> 4718.280000000001
and not just the most famous ones but

4715.699 --> 4722.0199999999995
just nobody has to know who they are

4718.28 --> 4725.3
they just have to be really [ __ ] epic

4722.02 --> 4727.580000000001
and actually convincing and not like

4725.3 --> 4730.58
really [ __ ] pretentious oh I'm

4727.58 --> 4734.0599999999995
special I'm rich I'm popular so I'm good

4730.58 --> 4736.28
no you got the [ __ ] out of here I want

4734.06 --> 4738.4400000000005
actual people that really are so good

4736.28 --> 4740.9
that nobody even knows who they are but

4738.44 --> 4745.178999999999
you recognize their work and love it

4740.9 --> 4745.179
yeah that's the people that I want

4745.28 --> 4748.0
foreign

4749.79 --> 4752.859
[Music]

4757.78 --> 4762.0199999999995
but yeah I don't know if I'm gonna get

4760.46 --> 4763.94
that

4762.02 --> 4765.5
I don't know if anybody that will ever

4763.94 --> 4767.659
get that

4765.5 --> 4770.179
maybe at some point I've got the script

4767.659 --> 4772.339999999999
developed and I could just roll out like

4770.179 --> 4773.78
to one of the bigger companies and say

4772.34 --> 4777.1990000000005
like hey

4773.78 --> 4780.139999999999
how about an actual awesome game to

4777.199 --> 4783.339999999999
really round out bulbers game instead of

4780.14 --> 4787.42
that crap that was rolled out

4783.34 --> 4787.42
and then maybe they'll do it

4793.4 --> 4800.96
or maybe I'll have to just build it

4796.88 --> 4803.36
through fans I mean Dragon spear Siege

4800.96 --> 4804.92
of the Dragon spear

4803.36 --> 4807.98
The Boulders gate one and a half that

4804.92 --> 4810.26
came after like years after what was

4807.98 --> 4812.599999999999
gate two

4810.26 --> 4815.3
that was made by fans and it looks

4812.6 --> 4816.620000000001
pretty good it's just music

4815.3 --> 4820.159000000001
it's not

4816.62 --> 4821.96
really up to up to par in my okay there

4820.159 --> 4823.639999999999
was some good stuff in there but it was

4821.96 --> 4825.9800000000005
overall it's just like no it's not

4823.64 --> 4828.46
Baldur's Gate really it's not as good as

4825.98 --> 4830.599999999999
that because that music was just

4828.46 --> 4832.28
unbelievably good

4830.6 --> 4834.56
like durable

4832.28 --> 4838.12
as in you hear it 20 years later and

4834.56 --> 4838.120000000001
it's still just as riveting

4839.12 --> 4842.38
that Dragon Spirit

4842.42 --> 4848.179
yeah I don't know it's it's just it's

4845.12 --> 4851.42
stepped down I can feel it right

4848.179 --> 4853.6990000000005
but it was made by fans and The Voice

4851.42 --> 4855.92
work was great

4853.699 --> 4858.98
was really liked it

4855.92 --> 4861.08
so there is that potential

4858.98 --> 4863.839999999999
and that's the like I'd like those

4861.08 --> 4866.48
people that worked on that to also be

4863.84 --> 4869.12
part of this

4866.48 --> 4870.86
because it will have character

4869.12 --> 4872.42
continuations

4870.86 --> 4875.42
I mean there's these characters in

4872.42 --> 4878.06
Baldur's Gate that really

4875.42 --> 4880.34
roll through the entire game and have

4878.06 --> 4883.46
actual character

4880.34 --> 4887.179
and it would be great if that if those

4883.46 --> 4888.44
character could return in Boulders in my

4887.179 --> 4890.719
game

4888.44 --> 4892.759999999999
after you're a deity

4890.719 --> 4895.9
the idea has to have followers and

4892.76 --> 4895.900000000001
friends too

4899.239 --> 4904.339999999999
and it would just they could work it

4902.239 --> 4906.32
could really work and continue that

4904.34 --> 4907.82
chemistry that there was

4906.32 --> 4911.78
anyway

4907.82 --> 4914.48
dude I just have ideas about this and

4911.78 --> 4917.9
probably will never happen anything with

4914.48 --> 4919.94
it but I am going to write a script for

4917.9 --> 4923.739
it just as I did with the Matrix three

4919.94 --> 4923.739
uh Matrix 4.

4923.96 --> 4929.55
which I sent to you by the way LSG you

4927.08 --> 4931.64
never responded to that

4929.55 --> 4934.28
[Music]

4931.64 --> 4937.52
hello by the way

4934.28 --> 4940.099999999999
but yeah I sent you like the text file

4937.52 --> 4943.2390000000005
for that script for the Matrix but you

4940.1 --> 4943.2390000000005
never responded to it

4944.48 --> 4949.839999999999
I think you might have been sick or

4946.46 --> 4949.84
something at the time but

4967.219 --> 4972.26
your gravity blue Dynamics yeah well

4970.1 --> 4973.88
give the [ __ ] they want to include

4972.26 --> 4976.76
gravity

4973.88 --> 4979.88
that's cute because they don't have to

4976.76 --> 4983.0
deal with gases

4979.88 --> 4985.46
in physics engines yeah so it's very

4983.0 --> 4987.8
easy it's very easy model to use yeah

4985.46 --> 4990.44
they can use gravity all they like

4987.8 --> 4992.06
they could also use relative density but

4990.44 --> 4993.919999999999
yeah then you have to deal with actual

4992.06 --> 4996.26
fluid dynamics

4993.92 --> 4999.1990000000005
with the actual fluid dynamics and then

4996.26 --> 5002.8
you have to have substance

4999.199 --> 5005.08
of gas density within the renderings and

5002.8 --> 5007.900000000001
all that seems a little excessive

5005.08 --> 5010.78
right so gravity is very easy right I

5007.9 --> 5013.0
mean you have objects polygons and it

5010.78 --> 5016.0599999999995
just like yeah this is material and then

5013.0 --> 5018.34
yeah and the rest is vacuum but you

5016.06 --> 5021.88
doesn't I mean there's doesn't have to

5018.34 --> 5023.9800000000005
actually be air in the visual simulation

5021.88 --> 5027.34
now does it so yeah it's very easy to

5023.98 --> 5029.98
just say oh gravity that's fine

5027.34 --> 5032.02
yeah that doesn't make reality have

5029.98 --> 5034.98
gravity though because in reality

5032.02 --> 5034.9800000000005
there's gas pressure

5037.719 --> 5044.44
and there's relative density

5040.719 --> 5045.76
things also go up yeah

5044.44 --> 5050.5
that's

5045.76 --> 5052.84
there's no helium balloon mechanics

5050.5 --> 5056.02
physics engine

5052.84 --> 5058.84
in a typical 3D game if there would be

5056.02 --> 5061.179
well guess what guess what yeah that's

5058.84 --> 5062.860000000001
not gravity formula then then they've

5061.179 --> 5065.4400000000005
actually applied a relative density

5062.86 --> 5068.679
formula but I've never seen that

5065.44 --> 5070.839999999999
right balloons in games are usually just

5068.679 --> 5072.64
like static they're just an object and

5070.84 --> 5075.400000000001
yeah they can just say oh you're fixed

5072.64 --> 5078.179
to this position even if you're mid-air

5075.4 --> 5078.179
so

5078.34 --> 5082.719
that's much easier to do

5081.04 --> 5085.6
I mean they're not actually going to

5082.719 --> 5089.38
simulate a real physics Engine with gas

5085.6 --> 5091.900000000001
pressure in some 3D game

5089.38 --> 5094.96
you know how much freaking extra

5091.9 --> 5097.5599999999995
rendering time that would take

5094.96 --> 5097.56
a lot

5097.9 --> 5101.62
that's like unnecessary amounts of

5100.239 --> 5103.959999999999
rendering time

5101.62 --> 5105.82
so yeah gravity makes it very easy it

5103.96 --> 5107.92
just says oh that's a standard full

5105.82 --> 5110.08
mechanism everything goes down goes boom

5107.92 --> 5112.36
boom very easy because anything that

5110.08 --> 5115.12
wouldn't go down go boom boom you can't

5112.36 --> 5117.699
see it anyway because it's not there

5115.12 --> 5121.36
you're looking through it

5117.699 --> 5122.98
yeah there's no rendering for gas

5121.36 --> 5127.92
even like oh there's a bit of

5122.98 --> 5127.919999999999
gaseousness yeah that's usually just

5127.96 --> 5133.2390000000005
a visual obstruction then that's just

5130.659 --> 5136.12
added on and it can be artistically made

5133.239 --> 5138.4
very realistically looks unlike some gas

5136.12 --> 5140.0199999999995
bloom or whatever but it there's no

5138.4 --> 5142.0
actual gas mechanics it's just a

5140.02 --> 5146.46
freaking other polygon

5142.0 --> 5146.46
okay I know how that works

5155.199 --> 5160.0599999999995
right but in my game there will be no

5157.6 --> 5162.820000000001
such issue because it's not going to be

5160.06 --> 5163.900000000001
3D

5162.82 --> 5166.36
yeah

5163.9 --> 5169.0
it's not

5166.36 --> 5171.159
the only 3D about it is not going to be

5169.0 --> 5174.78
the actual game itself but a lot of the

5171.159 --> 5174.78
looks I mean you're gonna have

5175.179 --> 5180.34
like an overview screen of the of the

5179.02 --> 5185.26
dimensions

5180.34 --> 5188.38
of the Realms and the deities over their

5185.26 --> 5190.96
respective personal realms

5188.38 --> 5193.06
and that's going to be like a it's very

5190.96 --> 5195.76
special very 3D

5193.06 --> 5200.580000000001
because yeah the gods are gonna have to

5195.76 --> 5200.58
look pretty spectacular as they do

5201.34 --> 5203.82
right

5204.159 --> 5209.138999999999
and as things change around

5206.56 --> 5211.780000000001
but that would be more like an over map

5209.139 --> 5214.4800000000005
basically over map of like the material

5211.78 --> 5217.48
plane and the other planes the Outer

5214.48 --> 5219.04
Planes with their respective deities and

5217.48 --> 5222.04
whatever you're doing

5219.04 --> 5225.34
and your new deity realm that you have

5222.04 --> 5228.82
to basically defend again against cyric

5225.34 --> 5231.159000000001
who was also the previous one to

5228.82 --> 5234.78
destroy your father

5231.159 --> 5234.78
that's how the whole thing happened

5234.94 --> 5237.9
right anyway

5240.699 --> 5245.739
there's a lot that can be done

5243.3 --> 5248.9400000000005
and I've got a vision for it and I'm

5245.739 --> 5248.94
gonna keep working it out

5270.1 --> 5277.06
foreign

5272.46 --> 5277.06
the fourth movie sucks

5283.179 --> 5287.38
like they ruined it

5284.98 --> 5289.78
they made a stupid Future movie it's

5287.38 --> 5292.06
like oh it's so much years later oh yeah

5289.78 --> 5294.699
well then you [ __ ] everything up what

5292.06 --> 5298.360000000001
you think just everything just nothing's

5294.699 --> 5300.299999999999
is gonna happen in all that time

5298.36 --> 5303.54
dude you're dealing with machines

5300.3 --> 5307.78
machines are quick

5303.54 --> 5310.6
machines change quick

5307.78 --> 5312.759999999999
there's no freaking way it's just gonna

5310.6 --> 5314.5
be like 80 years later with nothing

5312.76 --> 5316.2390000000005
special occurring except some

5314.5 --> 5318.179
technological development it was the

5316.239 --> 5321.699
dumbest [ __ ] thing I've ever seen

5318.179 --> 5324.1
worst decision you could imagine

5321.699 --> 5325.78
I mean that movie should have been like

5324.1 --> 5327.280000000001
The Matrix

5325.78 --> 5328.599999999999
six

5327.28 --> 5331.48
like

5328.6 --> 5333.58
a later Matrix after all the really

5331.48 --> 5334.659
important stuff in between has really

5333.58 --> 5338.159
happened

5334.659 --> 5338.159
I mean ugh

5340.9 --> 5343.44
right

5346.6 --> 5350.52
it was G why did you say something

5350.86 --> 5355.839999999999
oh that was good oh you did say it

5353.679 --> 5359.46
yeah you got another picture

5355.84 --> 5359.46
that was good so you liked it

5365.98 --> 5370.0199999999995
and the Matrix is still my favorite okay

5371.92 --> 5375.6990000000005
oh yeah well I have a script for the

5374.199 --> 5378.36
Matrix Four

5375.699 --> 5378.36
sort of

5401.52 --> 5407.26
pre-sequels before this is

5404.26 --> 5410.400000000001
no no you can't accept that b because

5407.26 --> 5410.400000000001
they [ __ ] it all up

5416.26 --> 5421.659000000001
but you can make another version of it

5418.54 --> 5423.28
you could technically say oh it was all

5421.659 --> 5429.58
an illusion

5423.28 --> 5432.46
it was The Matrix for that he believed

5429.58 --> 5434.5599999999995
right I mean a controlled internal

5432.46 --> 5436.179
Matrix like oh there is an Awakening

5434.56 --> 5439.120000000001
happy you're figuring it out it's not

5436.179 --> 5442.2390000000005
the real Matrix well yeah that could be

5439.12 --> 5444.94
the new Matrix the new Matrix that they

5442.239 --> 5446.259999999999
made after the whole thing could be

5444.94 --> 5448.48
oh yeah

5446.26 --> 5451.360000000001
that's Neo

5448.48 --> 5453.5199999999995
he's there again and oh he's figuring

5451.36 --> 5456.639
out it's not really the Matrix yeah that

5453.52 --> 5458.26
is the new Matrix the new Matrix is that

5456.639 --> 5459.9400000000005
you're in a world that's kind of pushing

5458.26 --> 5461.5
it in your face that it is a matrix so

5459.94 --> 5464.138999999999
that you will figure out is the Matrix

5461.5 --> 5466.32
and then try to awaken from it and then

5464.139 --> 5469.4800000000005
you will awaken from it

5466.32 --> 5472.84
within the new Matrix

5469.48 --> 5475.48
so that they made a matrix of the Zion

5472.84 --> 5478.42
situation which in reality wouldn't

5475.48 --> 5480.5199999999995
exist like that anymore huh

5478.42 --> 5483.12
yeah you could do it like that it's just

5480.52 --> 5485.679
slightly convoluted

5483.12 --> 5488.5199999999995
but I mean

5485.679 --> 5488.52
it's

5490.3 --> 5494.4400000000005
another Matrix

5492.4 --> 5495.699
the con actual continuation would be

5494.44 --> 5498.879999999999
great

5495.699 --> 5501.28
what I mean also yeah the the title

5498.88 --> 5503.38
character is not is it get is older now

5501.28 --> 5506.44
so it doesn't really work my my movie

5503.38 --> 5509.7390000000005
was literally a direct continuation

5506.44 --> 5512.98
a direct continuation

5509.739 --> 5515.739
where it's not too much later

5512.98 --> 5519.459999999999
and then Neo awakens

5515.739 --> 5522.58
like in The Matrix but not checked in

5519.46 --> 5525.54
like he is almost like an agent

5522.58 --> 5525.54
but he doesn't understand

5527.199 --> 5531.46
so yeah I got a one and a half page

5529.06 --> 5533.92
script about that

5531.46 --> 5536.02
and I shared it with LSG

5533.92 --> 5539.62
and there's still a lot of expand

5536.02 --> 5542.5
extension expansion to be added probably

5539.62 --> 5545.28
more detail but I thought it was a

5542.5 --> 5545.28
pretty good concept

5548.199 --> 5552.759999999999
Matrix within the Matrix in The Matrix

5550.54 --> 5554.739
yeah

5552.76 --> 5556.719
it doesn't have to be presented that

5554.739 --> 5559.44
lame though

5556.719 --> 5559.44
but

5560.44 --> 5566.98
yeah I mean if they just like it's very

5564.4 --> 5570.04
easy to just continue the movie and then

5566.98 --> 5574.419999999999
or the movie franchise and just make

5570.04 --> 5574.42
them all figure out like ship

5574.719 --> 5581.5
this whole thing the Machine World

5578.26 --> 5584.320000000001
right Zion

5581.5 --> 5587.08
we're figuring out that this is a matrix

5584.32 --> 5590.0199999999995
too but it makes us really uncomfortable

5587.08 --> 5592.179
and scared so nobody's really gonna

5590.02 --> 5594.1
give in to it because they don't know

5592.179 --> 5596.139
what the [ __ ] to do about it it's not

5594.1 --> 5598.120000000001
just some other Matrix you can wake up

5596.139 --> 5599.62
from in there

5598.12 --> 5602.38
like there's no there wouldn't be

5599.62 --> 5605.58
anybody there in that uh if you woke up

5602.38 --> 5605.58
from this Matrix right

5606.1 --> 5612.820000000001
from that second layer Matrix into the

5609.34 --> 5616.139
yeah the deeper underneath that so you

5612.82 --> 5616.139
would have the main Matrix

5616.199 --> 5621.099999999999
the or the final Matrix which would be

5619.239 --> 5623.98
well

5621.1 --> 5627.58
The Matrix then you have the Machine

5623.98 --> 5629.379999999999
World and Zion which would be the second

5627.58 --> 5632.38
tier Matrix and then you would have

5629.38 --> 5633.400000000001
another layer of the Matrix underneath

5632.38 --> 5637.56
that

5633.4 --> 5637.5599999999995
but that one would be very different

5637.719 --> 5642.219
and not

5639.28 --> 5644.92
like organized

5642.219 --> 5647.679
not like things happening in there in

5644.92 --> 5650.9800000000005
which all of this is a sub factor and

5647.679 --> 5653.32
that's part of my story in it

5650.98 --> 5655.959999999999
that it's actually sort of like the

5653.32 --> 5659.139
whole thing is lost

5655.96 --> 5661.6
like they lost themselves into Matrix a

5659.139 --> 5663.6990000000005
within a matrix it's basically like it

5661.6 --> 5665.679
would make the whole thing a bit like uh

5663.699 --> 5667.54
Dream Within A Dream Within a dream and

5665.679 --> 5670.179
that they got lost in the dream and that

5667.54 --> 5672.1
the Matrix is actually the result of

5670.179 --> 5676.54
getting lost

5672.1 --> 5678.9400000000005
with in virtual reality matrixes

5676.54 --> 5680.32
and that they caught themselves in there

5678.94 --> 5683.799999999999
by accident

5680.32 --> 5686.98
or Yeah by mistake

5683.8 --> 5689.34
and that everybody just forgot it wasn't

5686.98 --> 5689.339999999999
real

5692.92 --> 5697.659
and that the machine

5695.08 --> 5700.48
all the machines were all there always

5697.659 --> 5704.339999999999
there just to prevent you from figuring

5700.48 --> 5707.32
out that it is the Matrix and then

5704.34 --> 5708.03
everything falls into place in a real

5707.32 --> 5710.199
big way

5708.03 --> 5713.639
[Music]

5710.199 --> 5713.638999999999
that was part of my idea

5716.8 --> 5721.78
I'd love to maybe read out my script

5719.26 --> 5724.659000000001
sometime although I yeah it could

5721.78 --> 5727.259999999999
probably be better written it's still

5724.659 --> 5727.259999999999
very rough

5728.44 --> 5732.699
and there can be improvements

5735.58 --> 5740.739
but yeah I'm not gonna do that today

5737.139 --> 5742.9800000000005
because the show is almost rounding out

5740.739 --> 5742.98
foreign

5748.32 --> 5754.719
oh my God

5751.36 --> 5757.12
then is real oh God what I never thought

5754.719 --> 5759.4
of that oh my God if I

5757.12 --> 5761.639
if I move Flat Earth and then I can't

5759.4 --> 5766.239
get a job in

5761.639 --> 5769.84
geosciences oh my god what have I done

5766.239 --> 5772.299999999999
I always wanted a job in geosciences

5769.84 --> 5775.12
where they teach you how to presuppose a

5772.3 --> 5777.76
globe with every single thing you do

5775.12 --> 5781.0
how could have I missed that overlooked

5777.76 --> 5783.159000000001
that amazing opportunity of becoming a

5781.0 --> 5785.94
Geo scientist

5783.159 --> 5785.94
oh no

5796.36 --> 5804.599999999999
no right geoscientist

5799.179 --> 5804.6
also known as professional ball [ __ ]

5816.58 --> 5821.26
yeah turret

5818.56 --> 5823.179
it is

5821.26 --> 5826.719
but I mean

5823.179 --> 5830.62
dude you gotta be demoralized right

5826.719 --> 5833.56
after being told that you can't actually

5830.62 --> 5836.38
get a job in geosciences if you're a

5833.56 --> 5839.1990000000005
flat earther oh no oh my god what have

5836.38 --> 5842.32
we done what have we done the ultimate

5839.199 --> 5844.839999999999
opportunity becoming a geoscientist

5842.32 --> 5847.259999999999
where you presuppose the ball in

5844.84 --> 5851.139
everything you do

5847.26 --> 5853.659000000001
no what have I done the ultimate job

5851.139 --> 5857.219
opportunity I've missed it because I I'm

5853.659 --> 5857.219
a flat earther no

5862.06 --> 5868.02
yeah

5863.679 --> 5868.02
it is professional ball tired

5871.48 --> 5875.62
yeah because you want to be an

5873.159 --> 5878.219
astronomer

5875.62 --> 5878.219
oh God

5883.719 --> 5889.12
I mean you could make a lot of money

5886.659 --> 5891.46
say a lot of [ __ ] and be worshiped

5889.12 --> 5893.44
by a whole bunch of retards

5891.46 --> 5895.2390000000005
as well

5893.44 --> 5896.5599999999995
how could you pass up such an

5895.239 --> 5899.62
opportunity

5896.56 --> 5903.0
you can have all the money and retards

5899.62 --> 5903.0
and delusion in the world

5904.48 --> 5912.459999999999
I mean what could possibly go wrong

5907.36 --> 5914.199
how could you ever not enjoy that

5912.46 --> 5916.7390000000005
uh

5914.199 --> 5916.739
anyway

5925.239 --> 5929.62
how do you develop a game do you

5927.219 --> 5931.96
establish computer

5929.62 --> 5934.139
I don't know

5931.96 --> 5938.7390000000005
are you asking me I've never done it

5934.139 --> 5940.6
I've only ever just written ideas down

5938.739 --> 5944.199
formulas

5940.6 --> 5946.84
like I still have an entire boulder dash

5944.199 --> 5949.239
like super Bulba Dash like concept which

5946.84 --> 5952.0
is based on a game from the freaking 80s

5949.239 --> 5955.36
on my commodore 64.

5952.0 --> 5957.639
it's still ready to like you could

5955.36 --> 5960.04
almost have it scanned by the freaking

5957.639 --> 5962.86
AI or something the witch could

5960.04 --> 5966.96
literally just make the game from the

5962.86 --> 5966.96
data that I already have on paper

5967.3 --> 5970.3
right

5975.1 --> 5982.719
I just make Concepts that's what I do

5980.679 --> 5984.58
and I write it down on paper and then

5982.719 --> 5986.38
it's like yeah okay here's the

5984.58 --> 5988.62
instructions on how the game's gonna be

5986.38 --> 5988.62
gone

5993.159 --> 5998.44
I don't know how to actually do all that

5996.1 --> 6000.780000000001
I have no idea

5998.44 --> 6003.0
I mean I have a rough idea but I don't

6000.78 --> 6005.759999999999
know how complicated that is what the

6003.0 --> 6008.4
people are even like

6005.76 --> 6010.4400000000005
that would be working on it I don't know

6008.4 --> 6013.08
what they're like

6010.44 --> 6016.259999999999
I've never actually rolled into the

6013.08 --> 6019.88
gaming industry I really wanted to but I

6016.26 --> 6019.88
was just like rejected

6022.98 --> 6028.678999999999
like I I tried to roll into like an

6026.219 --> 6032.2390000000005
education for that at the time in huge

6028.679 --> 6034.1990000000005
amounts of effort to do that let me just

6032.239 --> 6036.48
rejected me

6034.199 --> 6039.599999999999
okay

6036.48 --> 6041.339999999999
it's like yeah oh I re I want to be a

6039.6 --> 6044.159000000001
video game maker

6041.34 --> 6046.38
my entire life here's like several

6044.159 --> 6048.54
extensive Concepts

6046.38 --> 6052.1990000000005
like a game that can be completely

6048.54 --> 6054.6
programmed just from this paper alone

6052.199 --> 6057.48
oh and here's in my ideas about virtual

6054.6 --> 6060.360000000001
reality and all that and a device that I

6057.48 --> 6062.159
devised on what I called actual reality

6060.36 --> 6066.239
where you would have literal an

6062.159 --> 6068.879999999999
exoskeleton that would stop that could

6066.239 --> 6072.239
stop your Motion in order to within the

6068.88 --> 6075.6
game simulate actually touching things

6072.239 --> 6079.0199999999995
so that you would have like a

6075.6 --> 6080.76
a wall or brick or something and in the

6079.02 --> 6083.040000000001
virtual reality it would be looking at

6080.76 --> 6087.360000000001
it you would touch it and then you would

6083.04 --> 6090.0
feel the pressure of it yeah I freaking

6087.36 --> 6092.219
designed a concept for a virtual reality

6090.0 --> 6098.1
suit that would actually make things

6092.219 --> 6098.1
touchable yeah and that was in 97.

6099.679 --> 6105.719
in 1997 I came up with that yeah

6103.679 --> 6108.4800000000005
and they really liked the idea though

6105.719 --> 6111.659
but they didn't and they didn't get I

6108.48 --> 6114.239
wasn't allowed in they took my idea

6111.659 --> 6118.58
though yeah they loved it love taking

6114.239 --> 6118.58
people's ideas and then kicking them up

6121.4 --> 6126.08
Illuminati got some funds incoming

6123.719 --> 6126.08
awesome

6129.0 --> 6131.78
let me check

6138.42 --> 6143.1
two I can get several Illuminati

6141.78 --> 6146.659
costumes from there thank you very much

6143.1 --> 6146.659000000001
dank I really appreciate the support

6157.739 --> 6160.58
that's awesome

6163.8 --> 6167.76
hmm

6165.719 --> 6172.82
right

6167.76 --> 6172.820000000001
man show is almost drawing to an end

6180.659 --> 6185.58
do you physicist why is it yeah it has

6184.199 --> 6187.799999999999
nothing to do with the Earth being a

6185.58 --> 6190.08
globe though that's just

6187.8 --> 6191.96
ground scanners yeah that's people

6190.08 --> 6195.179
trying to figure out

6191.96 --> 6198.659
what what is in the ground

6195.179 --> 6201.719
using several techniques yeah

6198.659 --> 6204.659
that's just people that know how to scan

6201.719 --> 6208.219
the ground to find things based on

6204.659 --> 6208.219
reading materials

6208.739 --> 6213.0199999999995
using scanners

6210.48 --> 6213.0199999999995
right

6214.02 --> 6218.46
you don't have to believe it's a globe

6216.06 --> 6221.280000000001
for that like that's not even that

6218.46 --> 6224.4
doesn't even get involved yeah

6221.28 --> 6225.78
because there's no geophysicist or

6224.4 --> 6226.86
people that are going to mine for

6225.78 --> 6229.86
material

6226.86 --> 6233.82
that are gonna go that deep

6229.86 --> 6236.099999999999
they never do because you can't you

6233.82 --> 6239.28
can't scan beyond the certain points

6236.1 --> 6240.6
can't even predict what's there

6239.28 --> 6242.759999999999
yeah

6240.6 --> 6245.1
so yeah it's just people that know how

6242.76 --> 6249.360000000001
to figure out what material is in the

6245.1 --> 6251.1
ground where up to a certain depth

6249.36 --> 6255.739
and then

6251.1 --> 6255.7390000000005
they can't be on the certain depth

6264.0 --> 6270.9
you should do physics no no it's just a

6267.0 --> 6274.1
freaking radar it doesn't use geophysics

6270.9 --> 6274.099999999999
it's [ __ ]

6276.84 --> 6283.88
yeah geophysics is just Globe

6280.219 --> 6283.88
presuppositional modeling

6284.58 --> 6290.34
it's just presupposition everything

6287.34 --> 6293.219
about it is presupposition

6290.34 --> 6295.38
there is no Globe there is no Globe

6293.219 --> 6298.02
measurement it's all just calculated

6295.38 --> 6299.46
with the presupposition of a sphere it's

6298.02 --> 6301.8
what they do

6299.46 --> 6305.159
all they ever do

6301.8 --> 6307.619000000001
yeah that's geophysics geophysics is

6305.159 --> 6311.219
presupposing that the actual flattered

6307.619 --> 6313.5599999999995
readings are sphere-based because of

6311.219 --> 6315.8
your calculation of it having to be a

6313.56 --> 6315.8
sphere

6322.03 --> 6325.349999999999
[Music]

6329.84 --> 6334.860000000001
yeah no [ __ ]

6332.34 --> 6337.219
thanks Dan is real thanks for the

6334.86 --> 6337.219
obvious

6337.98 --> 6347.28
yeah that's right Geo globe

6341.94 --> 6349.86
Globe presupposing math [ __ ]

6347.28 --> 6351.96
we know

6349.86 --> 6355.44
there's no proof of a globe the Earth is

6351.96 --> 6357.719
flat it's very very [ __ ] measurably

6355.44 --> 6362.599999999999
flat

6357.719 --> 6367.08
and all the data is organized in a way

6362.6 --> 6370.9800000000005
categorized that it's flat and then

6367.08 --> 6373.0199999999995
Globe [ __ ] Believers or religious nut

6370.98 --> 6375.36
cases that insist that everybody has to

6373.02 --> 6378.84
believe it's a globe will then use the

6375.36 --> 6382.32
Haver sign formula among other things

6378.84 --> 6384.4800000000005
to then bend that flat plane reading

6382.32 --> 6387.44
into a ball

6384.48 --> 6387.44
that's what happens

6391.639 --> 6397.7390000000005
right but I'm gonna run out the Shelf

6395.1 --> 6400.139
so thanks everyone for coming

6397.739 --> 6402.299999999999

Channel which should start up in just a

6443.52 --> 6448.5
few minutes from now hope to see you

6445.56 --> 6451.6900000000005
there in chat and until the next video

6448.5 --> 6465.109
keep it flat
