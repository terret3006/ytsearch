glass shard that I mentioned you before

358.1 --> 366.55
right anyway

361.13 --> 366.55
yeah good morning everyone it's Monday

368.559 --> 373.589
and I don't know yesterday was kind of a

377.159 --> 382.569
it was a pretty nice day the weather and

380.559 --> 385.899
all and I don't know I got to cool down

382.569 --> 389.529
a little needed that also went to bed

385.899 --> 392.679
really early like one o'clock and I

389.529 --> 395.319
needed it it was good because I guess I

392.679 --> 399.909
felt coming that the morning was going

395.319 --> 403.599
to be very hot so that way I actually

399.909 --> 409.449
managed to get a lot of sleep and get up

403.599 --> 412.62899999999996
relatively early and it's all good so

409.449 --> 423.759
there I got Tamera coffee by the way and

412.629 --> 425.499
green tea Tamera coffee is the best you

423.759 --> 429.789
know I've been drinking it now for how

425.499 --> 431.379
long half a year and I don't want

429.789 --> 433.36
regular coffee anymore

431.379 --> 437.34900000000005
I really don't I'm never gonna drink

433.36 --> 440.829
coffee without tumeric anymore cuz it is

437.349 --> 442.899
just so much better you know it's kind

440.829 --> 446.159
of its kind of odd when you first try it

442.899 --> 452.429
out but it's just better it feels better

446.159 --> 452.429
it's awesome yeah

455.26 --> 460.63
yeah just wanted to make note of that

461.81 --> 467.9
[Music]

464.32 --> 477.26
well they burned down a 5g tower in the

467.9 --> 482.0
UK last night really right well I am

477.26 --> 485.02
pretty much call it I got really a you

482.0 --> 488.27
guys probably heard yesterday's

485.02 --> 490.60999999999996
extremely long ball busters after-show

488.27 --> 495.71
I'm over at Nathan's I didn't even know

490.61 --> 499.18
what's recorded okay so but I got pretty

495.71 --> 503.32
much forward like yeah this is just like

499.18 --> 506.39
I'm not gonna go along with that like

503.32 --> 510.05
basically my attitude is like yeah when

506.39 --> 512.15
you go too far you're cooperating with

510.05 --> 514.4
something that is just blatantly illegal

512.15 --> 517.49
by any standards and then you're

514.4 --> 521.78
breaking the civil contract as a

517.49 --> 525.82
whatever you're supposed to be so Oh

521.78 --> 525.8199999999999
Chet froze thank you for telling me

536.49 --> 544.12
dank Mark Taylor dangerous really no

540.069 --> 547.0889999999999
he's just a news bulletin speaking

544.12 --> 550.269
points drum he's just copy pasting

547.089 --> 554.9200000000001
whatever he airs on the news you know he

550.269 --> 558.73
has already trouble just keeping his

554.92 --> 560.439
thinking in a consistent line so he just

558.73 --> 562.9300000000001
doesn't have room for critical thought

560.439 --> 565.529
it edit he's just really freaking dumb

562.93 --> 565.529
he's not dangerous

569.55 --> 586.24
yeah anyway okay on a plane

581.74 --> 589.839
well my Tamara coffee is basically two

586.24 --> 595.0600000000001
scoops like those typical coffee scoops

589.839 --> 599.5600000000001
of coffee and then ya spoon like this

595.06 --> 602.92
and just relatively flattened out mix

599.56 --> 606.3889999999999
through the bottom or the top part of

602.92 --> 614.819
the coffee powder in the filter and that

606.389 --> 614.819
gives me this that's the tea

625.37 --> 631.44
the ratio that's right that's the ratio

628.59 --> 632.34
between the tumeric and and the coffee

631.44 --> 635.48
that I use

632.34 --> 638.88
also don't forget I add a little pepper

635.48 --> 642.87
it's like with Tamera with the powder

638.88 --> 647.96
that I use it is five parts tumeric

642.87 --> 651.54
powder and one part black pepper powder

647.96 --> 654.02
so that is basically the recipe it's

651.54 --> 654.02
pretty basic

660.08 --> 672.33
leave my you go ahead your life well

668.13 --> 674.73
it's not very spicy it it has no

672.33 --> 677.3100000000001
sharpness no heat remnant because hey it

674.73 --> 678.84
is being water and filtered and all

677.31 --> 681.5699999999999
remember and even the coffee is

678.84 --> 685.89
filtering some of it know the pepper as

681.57 --> 690.1500000000001
a special mix yeah effect combined with

685.89 --> 692.31
new tumeric right pepper has a lot of

690.15 --> 694.8299999999999
influence on a lot of spicy type of

692.31 --> 696.81
things and that includes coffee it

694.83 --> 701.13
includes tumeric which by the way are

696.81 --> 703.38
both products that are typically from

701.13 --> 705.78
the same region so you got to keep that

703.38 --> 710.21
in mind it's a good combination anyway

705.78 --> 713.76
and the pepper the sharpness is not

710.21 --> 718.08
transferred it's so you have more like a

713.76 --> 720.6
very mild black pepper flavor flare

718.08 --> 723.57
through it all but it does help I think

720.6 --> 727.98
with with just the effectiveness of the

723.57 --> 729.9300000000001
tumeric I think I don't know it's kind

727.98 --> 734.98
of guesswork but I've been trying this

729.93 --> 737.9799999999999
that in mind and I love my Tamera coffee

734.98 --> 740.47
I don't drink too much of it I don't

737.98 --> 743.41
drink more than two cups like it's just

740.47 --> 747.87
never do that because that's just not

743.41 --> 747.87
healthy for me no matter how much do

749.68 --> 754.63
no matter how much to America using it

760.45 --> 764.6600000000001
but yeah I've been using that for quite

762.98 --> 769.58
a while now and I really like it so

764.66 --> 774.02
that's to wear a coffee invention barely

769.58 --> 776.63
invention is just anyone could basically

774.02 --> 778.73
try that has these types of herbs that

776.63 --> 785.99
has some - American yeah who doesn't

778.73 --> 790.66
have black pepper these days anyway also

785.99 --> 794.36
I used the coffee that I use is like a

790.66 --> 796.6899999999999
chiapas type very mild coffee because if

794.36 --> 800.42
you have the very strong Moreira

796.69 --> 801.98
arabic type coffees I don't know what

800.42 --> 804.77
that would be like I think it will

801.98 --> 808.6700000000001
probably not taste as nice as this

804.77 --> 812.24
variety so I've been using tumeric

808.67 --> 816.11
coffee with a mild type of coffee that's

812.24 --> 818.3
not really bitter and heavy you know

816.11 --> 825.4
some people like that like hard-hitting

818.3 --> 832.13
coffees I don't like those at all anyway

825.4 --> 838.37
uh right so man yeah that stream was

832.13 --> 840.23
pretty heavy and long and I even when it

838.37 --> 842.51
happened I had a suspicion like wow

840.23 --> 846.35
nathan is like putting in so much energy

842.51 --> 848.93
so long like he would never put in that

846.35 --> 850.7
much energy if he wasn't for if he

848.93 --> 852.53
wasn't able to show off with it if he

850.7 --> 854.4200000000001
wasn't recording so I I kind of had a

852.53 --> 857.15
suspicion like Matt this is too good he

854.42 --> 865.3
must be recording but I didn't know when

857.15 --> 869.39
he started up cuz yeah earlier

865.3 --> 871.88
qe was there as well then he said like

869.39 --> 872.68
no I'm not recording basically when the

871.88 --> 877.46
ball-busters

872.68 --> 880.0699999999999
show ended but apparently nathan then at

877.46 --> 880.82
some point did start recording but he

880.07 --> 882.61
didn't tell anyone

880.82 --> 891.82
Oh

882.61 --> 891.82
hey Adam ikan Tom Parker on a koala

898.6 --> 915.37
yep good to see you guys girls I was

911.14 --> 920.02
almost thinking of like could I do like

915.37 --> 925.0600000000001
a show outside somewhere that's probably

920.02 --> 929.04
not gonna be that easy cuz yeah just

925.06 --> 929.04
moving my computer is not gonna work

930.96 --> 942.25
wait although I might might be able to

935.86 --> 944.98
do it on the laptop but I'd first have

942.25 --> 947.74
to install all the proper things for

944.98 --> 949.9
that I don't know oh by the way yeah

947.74 --> 954.03
then still it needed internet cable for

949.9 --> 958.8
that well I could potentially do that

954.03 --> 958.8
hmm I wish I thought of that before

959.79 --> 965.11
maybe for a next time maybe for when it

962.5 --> 970.81
gets even hotter I will do it I'll just

965.11 --> 974.8000000000001
go there on the roof and do a show like

970.81 --> 977.91
on the middle of the roof in the great

974.8 --> 977.91
weather why not

983.67 --> 988.5
although there probably be a lot of

985.62 --> 990.15
noise around me you know I hope I'd have

988.5 --> 995.01
to do it on a day where there's not a

990.15 --> 996.84
lot of work because I thought like oh

995.01 --> 998.97
the roads kind of finished now right and

996.84 --> 1002.21
well then they started another project

998.97 --> 1005.9
apparently as I think they're building

1002.21 --> 1009.6800000000001
another bridge I have no idea why it

1005.9 --> 1013.2099999999999
doesn't even connect any Street crossing

1009.68 --> 1017.9899999999999
or anything into such a weird they just

1013.21 --> 1020.8000000000001
like bridge over there it's the road

1017.99 --> 1022.4
like the cars coming across it right now

1020.8 --> 1025.9099999999999
that bridge

1022.4 --> 1028.1
well apparently like a hundred meters to

1025.91 --> 1031.0700000000002
the right there and building another

1028.1 --> 1034.9699999999998
bridge but there's no crossing there or

1031.07 --> 1037.4299999999998
anything it's just the road and a

1034.97 --> 1039.8
walking path on the other it's like it

1037.43 --> 1041.329
makes no sense to me that they're doing

1039.8 --> 1043.48
that I have no idea why they're doing

1041.329 --> 1043.48
that

1046.27 --> 1063.58
shut up side five bridge oh that doesn't

1055.19 --> 1063.5800000000002
make any sense yeah

1068.51 --> 1074.99
is this the new thing now it's like okay

1071.67 --> 1077.76
since there is a serious issue

1074.99 --> 1080.19
concerning crooner and that it's

1077.76 --> 1083.64
probably not what yeah it's the

1080.19 --> 1086.6100000000001
situation seems to be hoaxed up and all

1083.64 --> 1088.8000000000002
that and then there's the g5 secret

1086.61 --> 1092.34
installation and stuff so does that mean

1088.8 --> 1095.1599999999999
that we can all they just mention those

1092.34 --> 1099.24
words as many times as a joke because

1095.16 --> 1102.27
it's funny right it's funny when that

1099.24 --> 1103.71
[ __ ] actually transpires a majority of

1102.27 --> 1106.68
people don't even know about it and we

1103.71 --> 1109.77
are literally being assaulted with this

1106.68 --> 1114.5700000000002
by governments in a concerted effort I

1109.77 --> 1116.8799999999999
don't think it's even funny you know but

1114.57 --> 1124.02
yeah maybe I'm a little bit too tense

1116.88 --> 1126.24
about this you know I just don't think

1124.02 --> 1133.32
it's funny at all I think it's very

1126.24 --> 1138.42
serious and I'm I'm kind of like I I can

1133.32 --> 1141.0
I can't accept that the majority of

1138.42 --> 1144.92
people would just let this all happen

1141.0 --> 1144.92
like that it's unacceptable

1151.07 --> 1156.09
yeah there was this video there was a

1153.51 --> 1162.3
one video that kind of expressed my

1156.09 --> 1164.4499999999998
feelings pretty directly I kind of liked

1162.3 --> 1168.68
it

1164.45 --> 1168.68
let's see if I can find it again

1181.6 --> 1184.6499999999999
[Music]

1190.59 --> 1193.6499999999999

so yeah that video definitely caught me

1617.49 --> 1626.1
and it's like yeah yeah that's I am NOT

1623.26 --> 1628.36
like putting it all directly on a

1626.1 --> 1631.4499999999998
specific nation or anything but

1628.36 --> 1633.9089999999999
basically yeah that's that's the type of

1631.45 --> 1634.0900000000001
rage yet that I have to deal with on my

1633.909 --> 1638.909
own

1634.09 --> 1642.4289999999999
- and I don't really have a a proper

1638.909 --> 1645.7800000000002
thing to do that - so I just shout it

1642.429 --> 1650.169
out when I think no people are listening

1645.78 --> 1657.6
but yeah that that's it that's exactly

1650.169 --> 1657.6000000000001
how I feel I'm so sick of it

1663.95 --> 1671.49
yeah there is none

1666.48 --> 1675.63
oh I think I do have a wit well not one

1671.49 --> 1678.03
like that not a real serious one but and

1675.63 --> 1680.0600000000002
not a fluffy one either it's I don't

1678.03 --> 1682.08
know it's a horseback riding whip I

1680.06 --> 1683.99
didn't know I think I threw it away I

1682.08 --> 1688.52
think you've got too old

1683.99 --> 1692.16
it would be like 230 years old

1688.52 --> 1694.56
no so I guess I don't have a whip but I

1692.16 --> 1696.8300000000002
know how to use one it's not that

1694.56 --> 1696.83
difficult

1715.029 --> 1722.0
yeah bate sexy RMC I know this guy was

1718.1 --> 1725.57
literally just say China China China he

1722.0 --> 1732.429
was believing the virus basically it's

1725.57 --> 1734.899
like the other side of yeah of the story

1732.429 --> 1736.159
so if you fully believe in that [ __ ]

1734.899 --> 1742.5189999999998
then what he does

1736.159 --> 1744.5
yeah that's also what happens but it it

1742.519 --> 1746.779
pretty much you know it doesn't really

1744.5 --> 1749.179
matter whether it is literally that

1746.779 --> 1751.82
supposed virus and all the situation no

1749.179 --> 1754.49
it is basically a communist assault a

1751.82 --> 1759.23
new world order assault psychologically

1754.49 --> 1763.58
through media on the people and attempts

1759.23 --> 1766.279
at martial medical martial law so it is

1763.58 --> 1772.99
a communist attack it's just not just

1766.279 --> 1772.99
China you know

1776.57 --> 1782.6
but yeah it's I get it it's very tough

1779.42 --> 1786.3700000000001
to basically blame your own country in

1782.6 --> 1786.37
such scenarios like that

1809.82 --> 1818.31
yesthank of course of course China dude

1814.41 --> 1821.96
yes that it is true what you're saying

1818.31 --> 1824.9099999999999
it's Kate it's always escape code look

1821.96 --> 1828.99
they they build up the tension and then

1824.91 --> 1831.69
they make groups whatever as countries

1828.99 --> 1834.41
people kill one another instead of

1831.69 --> 1834.41
killed them

1835.22 --> 1842.72
by constantly suggesting who your enemy

1838.83 --> 1845.8799999999999
is basically telling you or showing you

1842.72 --> 1848.81
who your enemy is and then pushing you

1845.88 --> 1857.13
until you attack them that's that it's

1848.81 --> 1859.98
the trick it's the same old trick but we

1857.13 --> 1862.98
could just point at the people that are

1859.98 --> 1866.58
literally doing these idiotic things

1862.98 --> 1870.65
that are making up these excuses and

1866.58 --> 1874.28
then creating these bills and just say

1870.65 --> 1878.43
we know what the [ __ ] you're doing

1874.28 --> 1884.25
you're not gonna get away with this it's

1878.43 --> 1885.99
like I don't know how far are people

1884.25 --> 1889.47
willing to go how much spirit do they

1885.99 --> 1891.72
have left in order to even stop this to

1889.47 --> 1896.52
literally just stop these papers from

1891.72 --> 1899.22

2435.91 --> 2440.92
that stopping your government from

2438.19 --> 2443.35
turning into a communist mind control

2440.92 --> 2448.6
police state how does that relate to

2443.35 --> 2451.75
anything about that it is that the the

2448.6 --> 2454.7799999999997
band-aid to make it all right so that

2451.75 --> 2456.97
it's okay that it this is all happening

2454.78 --> 2459.15
because supposedly that that is

2456.97 --> 2461.68
happening to that makes it all right no

2459.15 --> 2463.75
sorry to lash out like this it's just

2461.68 --> 2466.7799999999997
that all the responses here it's all

2463.75 --> 2470.76
like oh but this over that a thousand

2466.78 --> 2474.76
excuses to do nothing a thousand excuses

2470.76 --> 2478.84
to do nothing that's what your smarts

2474.76 --> 2482.4100000000003
are giving you right now where first

2478.84 --> 2485.08
your smarts were your effective tool to

2482.41 --> 2486.3399999999997
find a way out now your smarts are your

2485.08 --> 2488.86
the worst

2486.34 --> 2492.88
obstruction you got it's the thing that

2488.86 --> 2495.58
makes you make a thousand excuses in

2492.88 --> 2498.73
some way to get distracted in some way

2495.58 --> 2505.39
not to do anything about it not to do

2498.73 --> 2509.59
what is absolutely required right now my

2505.39 --> 2513.3399999999997
plans is to spread these ideas because I

2509.59 --> 2517.09
don't even really know any people really

2513.34 --> 2519.4
I'm not a community guy at all I'm a

2517.09 --> 2521.86
very much a loner and a very

2519.4 --> 2525.4900000000002
controversial figure especially in the

2521.86 --> 2528.51
Netherlands like but I do resonate with

2525.49 --> 2531.85
some people and there are some very

2528.51 --> 2533.8
crowdy guys out there not crowder but

2531.85 --> 2538.12
just even the net and there are guys

2533.8 --> 2540.96
that do have a lot of community feel and

2538.12 --> 2543.64
I think that they do pick up on this

2540.96 --> 2544.63
they do I think some of them may even be

2543.64 --> 2546.97
listening to my show

2544.63 --> 2549.46
it's kind of weird realization like

2546.97 --> 2551.83
really my show it's way too boring right

2549.46 --> 2554.29
way too boring for the Dutch standard

2551.83 --> 2555.39
it's like I even have long pauses that's

2554.29 --> 2557.99
just a no no

2555.39 --> 2560.67
I know but yeah I have to stay natural

2557.99 --> 2561.7799999999997
so that is what I'm gonna do I'm the

2560.67 --> 2564.57
idea guy

2561.78 --> 2568.4100000000003
I see things coming I see inevitability

2564.57 --> 2572.52
and this is what I see and I hope that

2568.41 --> 2577.95
people are really gonna take this very

2572.52 --> 2581.61
serious because yeah the psychological

2577.95 --> 2585.0899999999997
and societal assault by government just

2581.61 --> 2587.3700000000003
went from a March to a sprint it's

2585.09 --> 2591.78
happening right now it's not gonna stop

2587.37 --> 2593.97
unless it's very blatantly obvious it is

2591.78 --> 2596.2200000000003
stopping and you would notice that by

2593.97 --> 2599.0099999999998
subtly government just something

2596.22 --> 2600.8999999999996
switches around like people are getting

2599.01 --> 2603.57
arrested it's like yeah yeah this we got

2600.9 --> 2606.6
him like that that's the only way you

2603.57 --> 2610.4700000000003
know okay this is actually now real when

2606.6 --> 2613.5299999999997
the blabbering political idiots with

2610.47 --> 2618.87
their freakin climate change in nonsense

2613.53 --> 2623.01
policies and and the corona panic [ __ ]

2618.87 --> 2625.62
and then all that when they suddenly get

2623.01 --> 2627.2700000000004
silenced and it's like yeah we're done

2625.62 --> 2634.23
with this [ __ ] now we're gonna actually

2627.27 --> 2637.71
continue just working on the country no

2634.23 --> 2639.63
more [ __ ] and that's the only way

2637.71 --> 2640.86
you would know and hey this could happen

2639.63 --> 2643.4900000000002
in countries you know I think they're

2640.86 --> 2648.78
maybe even already moves by certain

2643.49 --> 2653.22
leaders to kind of do that so it's up to

2648.78 --> 2655.71
each each country everywhere to figure

2653.22 --> 2657.6899999999996
this out and a if there's an if if it's

2655.71 --> 2660.42
too corrupt if everything everyone in

2657.69 --> 2662.9700000000003
government is just gonna make it just

2660.42 --> 2664.5
gonna let it all happen then it's up to

2662.97 --> 2669.3799999999997
the people there's no other choice

2664.5 --> 2673.62
because this is neo feudalism this is a

2669.38 --> 2676.55
enslavement move this is them with a

2673.62 --> 2679.2
lasso putting around your neck and

2676.55 --> 2681.78
tightening it up because they don't want

2679.2 --> 2683.9399999999996
you to get your oxygen so you bill can

2681.78 --> 2686.5800000000004
building up up enough strength to kind

2683.94 --> 2688.68
of stop them so they can keep dragging

2686.58 --> 2688.89
you around with that lasso it's going to

2688.68 --> 2690.72
be

2688.89 --> 2692.7599999999998
very tough to get it off again once they

2690.72 --> 2697.47
get it on that's happening right now

2692.76 --> 2700.4300000000003
people right now this is not a joke this

2697.47 --> 2706.1899999999996
is not it is a metaphor but it is

2700.43 --> 2710.46
happening right now this is being done

2706.19 --> 2713.43
and there's a lot of people just letting

2710.46 --> 2717.15
it happen or even saying like oh well

2713.43 --> 2720.5099999999998
they all lie so I'm just gonna ignore

2717.15 --> 2725.01
everything well guess what that doesn't

2720.51 --> 2728.34
really solve everything I they're you

2725.01 --> 2735.8700000000003
know they're still gonna come on they're

2728.34 --> 2738.57
gonna find new more worse ways and then

2735.87 --> 2742.2599999999998
do it again and then after that more

2738.57 --> 2746.96
it's see they will not stop until they

2742.26 --> 2746.96
are stopped so it's up to you

2755.86 --> 2763.6
well Plata Arda maybe in the Netherlands

2759.7 --> 2766.06
it's not that terribly bad yet but

2763.6 --> 2769.33
there's some it is pretty bad you know

2766.06 --> 2772.0
this there's still there's a lot of

2769.33 --> 2773.83
counter movement though you know there's

2772.0 --> 2778.06
a lot of spirits still left in the Dutch

2773.83 --> 2781.5
people on some sites but at the same

2778.06 --> 2781.5
time they keep on pushing it

2786.29 --> 2793.33
yeah yeah guys look I this is not doom

2790.01 --> 2796.0400000000004
and gloom ah it is not it is just

2793.33 --> 2798.08
pragmatic I'm just being pragmatic here

2796.04 --> 2801.95
it's not doom and gloom you know I don't

2798.08 --> 2805.06
do that you know it you know that I have

2801.95 --> 2809.39
a great confidence in creation and in

2805.06 --> 2812.33
ultimate balance even and in in God this

2809.39 --> 2816.02
is not gloom and doom this is reality

2812.33 --> 2820.49
you can see it happening you can hear

2816.02 --> 2823.7
the people you have to respond now you

2820.49 --> 2825.89
have to respond now and responding does

2823.7 --> 2828.49
not mean blah blah blah blah blah blah

2825.89 --> 2832.16
blah blah blah blah blah blah all day no

2828.49 --> 2835.04
responding means condensing it realizing

2832.16 --> 2839.6299999999997
that shit's gonna get real we are under

2835.04 --> 2843.2599999999998
assault by government a conspiracy it is

2839.63 --> 2845.87
a conspiracy against the people and it's

2843.26 --> 2852.7000000000003
unfolding now it's moving from a march

2845.87 --> 2852.7
to a sprint Spears pointing right at us

2855.73 --> 2862.4900000000002
this is not a time to just sit and stand

2859.61 --> 2864.59
by anymore and it's not a time to just

2862.49 --> 2866.0299999999997
talk all day long bla bla bla bla bla

2864.59 --> 2867.71
about the same thing other thing over

2866.03 --> 2871.57
again until you get so sick of it that

2867.71 --> 2875.63
you forget about it because there is

2871.57 --> 2878.03
that's not an option that means you will

2875.63 --> 2881.11
do the same thing as the ones that just

2878.03 --> 2883.5800000000004
completely don't even know it's gonna

2881.11 --> 2886.9700000000003
it's the same thing if you do that no no

2883.58 --> 2891.2
this is something you gotta get serious

2886.97 --> 2896.27
now you got a size up the people around

2891.2 --> 2900.29
you and gotta figure out like how are we

2896.27 --> 2902.12
gonna stop this who are there still good

2900.29 --> 2906.02
enough people around that are gonna

2902.12 --> 2910.49
really defend make a last stand against

2906.02 --> 2914.57
this absolute demonic mind-control [ __ ]

2910.49 --> 2915.5989999999997
and stop the government with their

2914.57 --> 2920.2200000000003
insane

2915.599 --> 2921.869
and slave Minh who is gonna stop it

2920.22 --> 2924.269
who is gonna stand up he you know you

2921.869 --> 2926.19
know with their yeah they're gonna throw

2924.269 --> 2929.4599999999996
it's same like Flat Earth you know

2926.19 --> 2931.529
everything Flat Earth God that's just

2929.46 --> 2933.42
the standard that that response that

2931.529 --> 2936.809
society gives to Flat Earth is that's

2933.42 --> 2939.089
the standard everyone that resists will

2936.809 --> 2940.8590000000004
get that one way or the other they will

2939.089 --> 2943.019
call you all kinds of things it will be

2940.859 --> 2945.38
the same attitude like a robot because

2943.019 --> 2948.749
that's what it really is it's a giant

2945.38 --> 2951.509
soulless robots and everybody's a little

2948.749 --> 2953.609
switch in it because they gave up they

2951.509 --> 2956.579
gave up for whatever reason trinkets

2953.609 --> 2960.39
being overwhelmed just being freaking

2956.579 --> 2963.599
weak they're all part of that giant

2960.39 --> 2967.14
robot and as soon as you say no no no I

2963.599 --> 2972.9
am an individual I have my own destiny

2967.14 --> 2976.92
and I trust God then the robots will

2972.9 --> 2981.2690000000002
show we'll take off the mask and show it

2976.92 --> 2983.849
is a robot and say you are bigots you

2981.269 --> 2986.8999999999996
are a racist you're an anti-semite test

2983.849 --> 2989.009
you're an anarchist you're a terrorist

2986.9 --> 2991.9790000000003
that's exactly what's going to happen

2989.009 --> 2996.839
there's no other way people there's no

2991.979 --> 3000.3489999999997
other way than to step there to let it

2996.839 --> 3002.63
happen like that keep to your principles

3000.349 --> 3004.7000000000003
be very careful everything they throw at

3002.63 --> 3007.549
you is pretty much bluff but if you step

3004.7 --> 3009.859
out of line with what is real the large

3007.549 --> 3013.359
rules the real rules then you got a

3009.859 --> 3016.16
problem it's a it's a great trial but if

3013.359 --> 3018.14
if nobody does it if not enough people

3016.16 --> 3024.71
do it if you don't get a mass together

3018.14 --> 3026.66
to do this then then Satan wins it's not

3024.71 --> 3032.2
gonna win forever but when Satan wins

3026.66 --> 3032.2
that means huge amounts of people die

3032.44 --> 3040.539
that's pretty much it so yeah what

3037.19 --> 3043.219
you're gonna do I'm gonna sit back lazy

3040.539 --> 3045.7990000000004
so tough all the mind control but look

3043.219 --> 3047.119
it's so peaceful oh I just can't ignore

3045.799 --> 3050.559
all of it

3047.119 --> 3054.65
and yeah and then you get to find out

3050.559 --> 3056.239
afterward like well well there's some

3054.65 --> 3059.029
genocide happen over there

3056.239 --> 3062.95
oh wow all these people suddenly died

3059.029 --> 3062.95
ooh oh well

3071.8 --> 3080.38
right so again being a bit of an

3076.75 --> 3083.38
alarmist this is not doom this is

3080.38 --> 3087.78
absolutely not doom it's only doom if

3083.38 --> 3087.78
you if you just let it go

3087.9 --> 3106.1800000000003
it's all fine no it has to stop the

3100.39 --> 3109.21
[ __ ] has to stop the [ __ ] in

3106.18 --> 3112.7799999999997
politics there are stupid policies that

3109.21 --> 3113.89
only corporations want okay it is

3112.78 --> 3116.92
already corporatist

3113.89 --> 3120.64
it the practically corporatist the

3116.92 --> 3123.73
politicians are there to blabber on to

3120.64 --> 3126.85
convince the people that it is there in

3123.73 --> 3130.75
in their interest that they want this

3126.85 --> 3133.2
[ __ ] that the corporation's want that's

3130.75 --> 3137.7
that's what they do now

3133.2 --> 3140.7
this is unacceptable people it is

3137.7 --> 3140.7
unacceptable

3163.78 --> 3172.61
yes yes it is

3168.13 --> 3174.38
tiny womble but the problem is it

3172.61 --> 3177.05
doesn't even matter if a country does

3174.38 --> 3180.44
not lock down or if it does the problem

3177.05 --> 3185.6600000000003
is is that so many countries have so the

3180.44 --> 3187.19
damage is already done so technically it

3185.66 --> 3189.8599999999997
doesn't even matter anymore it's just

3187.19 --> 3192.77
like okay how quickly do you want your

3189.86 --> 3194.54
country to go financially bust if you

3192.77 --> 3197.96
want it very quickly then go in a full

3194.54 --> 3200.5099999999998
lockdown you don't then just let it sit

3197.96 --> 3203.59
by closed off the borders or something

3200.51 --> 3208.7000000000003
and is this fine nobody is gonna die

3203.59 --> 3218.54
not really it's just stats nobody dies

3208.7 --> 3221.6299999999997
of Corona it's all just stats and I

3218.54 --> 3223.7599999999998
actually I've seen the freaking news

3221.63 --> 3225.92
again in the Netherlands they had a

3223.76 --> 3229.4900000000002
freaking item where they would literally

3225.92 --> 3232.73
just with picture and all say look this

3229.49 --> 3235.7
Dutch person some old person he

3232.73 --> 3238.16
contracted to Corona and then he died so

3235.7 --> 3241.37
they were literally like yeah people die

3238.16 --> 3244.04
of Corona people this person died of

3241.37 --> 3246.79
Corona he died a corona Oh guess what

3244.04 --> 3251.45
does an old person with health problems

3246.79 --> 3257.24
but he died of Corona here people die of

3251.45 --> 3259.49
Corona they died of yeah because we say

3257.24 --> 3263.3799999999997
it on the news now you can feel guilty

3259.49 --> 3267.04
you can feel guilty for not going along

3263.38 --> 3270.59
we're not locking down for not dying

3267.04 --> 3273.5299999999997
because somebody died of Corona because

3270.59 --> 3276.23
we say they did and they say you to

3273.53 --> 3279.05
their family says it do they say they

3276.23 --> 3281.69
died of Corona and that's the proof and

3279.05 --> 3285.5600000000004
now you can all feel guilty you can all

3281.69 --> 3288.68
feel very very guilty now for saying

3285.56 --> 3290.99
that Corona doesn't exist that maybe

3288.68 --> 3294.3199999999997
it's [ __ ] you can feel very guilty

3290.99 --> 3296.27
now because we showed it at a whole news

3294.32 --> 3298.6400000000003
item look this

3296.27 --> 3301.97
person he was so nice and then he got

3298.64 --> 3305.6299999999997
Corona and then he died and now you can

3301.97 --> 3308.39
feel guilty all day for daring to think

3305.63 --> 3311.9500000000003
that Corona is not a worthy enough cause

3308.39 --> 3316.85
to completely [ __ ] up the country with

3311.95 --> 3319.33
ridiculous measures and just financial

3316.85 --> 3322.7599999999998
collapse you can all feel guilty now

3319.33 --> 3329.75
because we on the television we showed

3322.76 --> 3332.42
you people that died of Corona yeah it's

3329.75 --> 3337.1
my own fault I D I was the one that did

3332.42 --> 3338.4500000000003
it I turn it on I asked for it because

3337.1 --> 3340.88
it's a [ __ ] Netherlands

3338.45 --> 3343.97
it's the Netherlands and they're like

3340.88 --> 3347.51
the worst mind assaulting television

3343.97 --> 3350.54
ever dude if you think that like

3347.51 --> 3353.51
American television is bad you should

3350.54 --> 3356.45
check out the Dutch television it's it's

3353.51 --> 3358.2200000000003
another level man because they are

3356.45 --> 3360.89
actually a little bit more careful

3358.22 --> 3363.62
they're not just hammering you with

3360.89 --> 3368.42
idiotic [ __ ] on your head no they they

3363.62 --> 3373.25
sneak it in there it's so creepy it

3368.42 --> 3375.9500000000003
literally makes me feel every time I see

3373.25 --> 3378.95
that kind of [ __ ] they put everything in

3375.95 --> 3382.31
everything they got into manipulating

3378.95 --> 3384.62
it's full mind control it's so sick and

3382.31 --> 3390.0099999999998
the people just they get into it and

3384.62 --> 3393.71
they even feel like ah I matter

3390.01 --> 3397.05
I'm on the television

3393.71 --> 3397.05
[Music]

3398.76 --> 3403.78
yeah I can only speak for the

3400.81 --> 3418.48
Netherlands by the way I don't watch

3403.78 --> 3422.6800000000003
German television oh really because that

3418.48 --> 3426.04
is how it happened tiny Womble the one

3422.68 --> 3428.3799999999997
third die from the Spanish flu one-third

3426.04 --> 3429.0099999999998
of the world's population I don't think

3428.38 --> 3433.1800000000003
so buddy

3429.01 --> 3437.32
but we get it right so how did that

3433.18 --> 3440.44
happen that the Spanish flu not just

3437.32 --> 3445.56
suddenly over the time span of a few

3440.44 --> 3450.58
days everywhere but didn't everywhere

3445.56 --> 3453.85
how is the corona measures and social

3450.58 --> 3458.64
distancing gonna stop that are you

3453.85 --> 3463.36
[ __ ] how is that gonna stop that

3458.64 --> 3465.64
it's ridiculous I'm pretty sure that the

3463.36 --> 3469.1800000000003
vast vast majority of the world's

3465.64 --> 3473.2
population has already gotten this

3469.18 --> 3475.66
Corona and got over it maybe even have

3473.2 --> 3478.96
gotten it again and then got over it

3475.66 --> 3482.0099999999998
again already okay I think this is

3478.96 --> 3488.79
probably one of the most the least

3482.01 --> 3488.7900000000004
lethal things we've experienced

3507.249 --> 3512.66
okay Thank You pelota I appreciate that

3510.109 --> 3517.819
I I have some communication with my

3512.66 --> 3524.319
healer who kind of says that to shut up

3517.819 --> 3526.91
tiny wubble I yeah I appreciate that I

3524.319 --> 3533.959
don't know for sure but all I know is

3526.91 --> 3536.209
that I'm not gonna hide anymore it's but

3533.959 --> 3540.1699999999996
it maybe this is like my alex jones

3536.209 --> 3543.8799999999997
moment before yet the old one it's

3540.17 --> 3546.7690000000002
because it feels like yeah i must be

3543.88 --> 3549.049
there must be people out there that kind

3546.769 --> 3552.2889999999998
of look at me and they're just that in

3549.049 --> 3554.509
the netherlands that probably in in

3552.289 --> 3558.13
power places and they probably cannot

3554.509 --> 3561.709
stand me and they're probably really

3558.13 --> 3564.349
really thankful that i kind of avoid the

3561.709 --> 3567.94
dutch scene because that would be an

3564.349 --> 3572.029
absolute nightmare to them because i

3567.94 --> 3573.589
freaking hate what's going on here so

3572.029 --> 3575.719
they're kind of happy that i just stick

3573.589 --> 3578.479
to my english crowd and all that and the

3575.719 --> 3583.4
americans and kind of stay out of their

3578.479 --> 3586.3689999999997
way but yeah that may change at some

3583.4 --> 3589.039
point but it's not gonna be it's gonna

3586.369 --> 3593.089
be rough one that when i do that they're

3589.039 --> 3595.579
gonna attack me so bad it's like if you

3593.089 --> 3597.92
see what you see in the nastiness of

3595.579 --> 3598.9300000000003
trolls in chat right how they get

3597.92 --> 3603.799
sometimes

3598.93 --> 3608.18
well there's dutch people that'll do

3603.799 --> 3612.65
that level of talking psychological salt

3608.18 --> 3616.489
to your face and they'll do it like

3612.65 --> 3618.0190000000002
hoping you will attack them because then

3616.489 --> 3620.329
they'll send your load their lawyers

3618.019 --> 3621.319
after you there's yeah that happens here

3620.329 --> 3624.829
hmm

3621.319 --> 3628.099
looking so forward to that looking so

3624.829 --> 3632.329
forward to that I'm actually being yeah

3628.099 --> 3634.2490000000003
sarcastic here but it's just like yeah

3632.329 --> 3636.88
there's just no way to avoid that [ __ ]

3634.249 --> 3636.8799999999997
at some point

3640.58 --> 3643.58
yeah

3652.369 --> 3657.319
we already got the virus and we got over

3655.339 --> 3659.98
a tiny one but maybe you should get over

3657.319 --> 3659.98
it too

3665.73 --> 3671.789
[Music]

3675.83 --> 3678.96
[Music]

3683.43 --> 3689.3689999999997

3686.799 --> 3691.869
some Dutch people here just so you know

3689.369 --> 3694.869
I've been offered it sort of before like

3703.18 --> 3709.75
fully Dutch spoken right but I am open

3727.45 --> 3734.02
on the Dutch platform but you got to

3731.47 --> 3736.48

3736.48 --> 3747.28
the Dutch scene I don't keep track it's

3742.77 --> 3749.549
so it would be interesting if somebody

3811.63 --> 3821.3900000000003

3912.359 --> 3916.5
don't just sit in the back and let
