became super stormy and I mean super

119.52 --> 124.79899999999999
storm Army like so heavy that sometimes

122.799 --> 127.119
it felt like the entire house was going

124.799 --> 131.72

127.119 --> 134.319
something really really powerful wind G

139.68 --> 146.92000000000002
rosemary plant actually just sat through

146.92 --> 155.04
I this rosemary plant is just real to me

151.36 --> 155.04000000000002

282.36 --> 287.12

285.759 --> 291.28000000000003
lot better

370.199 --> 372.479
strong

372.96 --> 379.23999999999995
emotions but also great I think a real

376.199 --> 381.36
big sense of like responsibility and all

379.24 --> 385.72
that

381.36 --> 385.72

443.759 --> 447.44
moving what do you guys

448.319 --> 451.319
think

454.68 --> 461.319
you like the try Illuminati okay well

457.72 --> 461.319
you can get them at the EO

463.28 --> 471.79999999999995
Plaza I yeah I don't know about like in

467.919 --> 471.79999999999995
England or the unit I don't

472.199 --> 478.639
know I'm sure there's something that's

475.12 --> 482.0
very similar out there I mean it's it's

478.639 --> 487.40000000000003
a pretty bad basic thing I mean it's

482.0 --> 487.4
it's just like a cross like wrap

487.96 --> 494.56
dough thing like with some vegetable

492.159 --> 499.12
paste that seems

494.56 --> 503.24
like with yeah grounded up peas

499.12 --> 506.28000000000003
and and celery and that kind of

503.24 --> 508.24
thing so there's this vegetable paste

506.28 --> 512.4399999999999
inside it's it's very

508.24 --> 512.44
basic I mean I bet

512.88 --> 519.64
that like a real homesteading cooking

517.08 --> 521.6800000000001
woman could probably figure out how to

519.64 --> 524.68
make them

521.68 --> 524.68
themselves

524.72 --> 529.88
right but it's just very convenient to

527.16 --> 533.7199999999999
me of course because I am not really a

529.88 --> 533.72
home cooker that

538.2 --> 544.0400000000001
much

541.079 --> 548.1999999999999
well maybe there is like cant do and all

544.04 --> 550.88
that for sale so if I had

548.2 --> 553.279
like if I knew exactly how to make that

550.88 --> 555.959
vegetable paste properly then maybe one

553.279 --> 558.48
time I could try to make it

555.959 --> 561.16
myself right and I'm sure that if I'd

558.48 --> 564.76
get in in better positions financially

561.16 --> 567.8389999999999
and all that I would love to start doing

564.76 --> 569.8389999999999
trying that I mean if I had the time and

567.839 --> 571.519
the money for that sort of thing yeah I

569.839 --> 575.1600000000001
definitely go

571.519 --> 576.8
like try to get interesting in the

575.16 --> 579.519
kitchen

576.8 --> 582.959
concerning like trying to make things

579.519 --> 586.04
myself that I like that are out there

582.959 --> 588.8389999999999
which I've done like with most

586.04 --> 592.079
food cuz I learned to cook everything

588.839 --> 592.0790000000001
