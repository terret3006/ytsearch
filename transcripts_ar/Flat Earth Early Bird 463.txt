the last week very happy about that said

95.899 --> 99.289
no no it was just a man too young right

98.33 --> 101.96

107.9 --> 130.84
oh yeah first of course the weather no

127.67 --> 130.84
ring at the moment

132.14 --> 137.57
oh yeah and it seems like they've almost

135.59 --> 139.76
pretty much finished a road they even

137.57 --> 145.19
put some stripes on it on the asphalt

139.76 --> 150.17
over there already from here

145.19 --> 152.21
but yeah people walking bicycling across

150.17 --> 159.76999999999998
the bridge at least I don't love the

152.21 --> 165.89000000000001
cars yet I think but anyway I got green

159.77 --> 171.56
tea with me so let's see who is in jet

165.89 --> 180.91
today ah a GM was first good servant

171.56 --> 180.91
uber macaw rented flat earthers in there

183.43 --> 186.61
Amanda young

190.44 --> 202.32
more colors when when rockhound new

193.32 --> 210.48
english by or english be I said it a

202.32 --> 211.07999999999998
Cosentino dank yeah I think I got all of

210.48 --> 219.20999999999998
you now

211.08 --> 221.76000000000002
thanks for joining it's okay you're

219.21 --> 224.86
going after gatekeepers are you Randy

221.76 --> 224.85999999999999
[Music]

232.1 --> 236.82999999999998
so what does that mean exactly

239.22 --> 242.31
[Music]

276.24 --> 281.99
alright that yeah Randy just as long as

279.24 --> 285.0
you don't go too far concerning

281.99 --> 288.84000000000003
individuals that are part of the Flat

285.0 --> 291.96
Earth debate you know legitimate

288.84 --> 296.94
criticism is it's not I do it myself but

291.96 --> 300.06
just don't go too far don't don't try to

296.94 --> 302.87
polarize things for your games that

300.06 --> 302.87
would not be appreciated

307.479 --> 313.15
yeah yeah I am one of those people Randy

310.659 --> 317.919
I don't think that viruses are really

313.15 --> 322.56899999999996
even what they say it is medically okay

317.919 --> 326.229
so yeah but the impact of course the

322.569 --> 328.509
impact is mostly psychological and all

326.229 --> 330.87899999999996
these people that love to talk about it

328.509 --> 332.83000000000004
love to grip the people's imagination oh

330.879 --> 335.86
the opportunity well guess what you're

332.83 --> 341.81899999999996
the ones actually causing most of the

335.86 --> 344.83000000000004
damage to the economy because you're

341.819 --> 347.529
feeding into the fear that'll make

344.83 --> 354.219
people retract from their normal

347.529 --> 357.759
economic activities hmm yeah no games

354.219 --> 361.12
it's the real deal yeah it is it is the

357.759 --> 364.3
damage is the real deal the actual

361.12 --> 367.18
damage not the not the story the fear in

364.3 --> 369.339
front of it I already gave my prognosis

367.18 --> 373.979
as to what is really probably gonna go

369.339 --> 376.899
down it's just gonna be like 90 90 80s

373.979 --> 380.62
just a Spanish flu and everybody's gonna

376.899 --> 386.459
get it because it's like a wave that

380.62 --> 391.629
just overcomes everyone eventually

386.459 --> 394.93
that's what I think and yeah it's not

391.629 --> 397.439
what they say it is I think it's just a

394.93 --> 401.649
natural part of the metabolic system and

397.439 --> 405.31
all these correlative things that have

401.649 --> 411.31
been concluded on which the entire virus

405.31 --> 414.279
concept is based yeah that is just it's

411.31 --> 416.949
it's presuppositional science fiction in

414.279 --> 418.93
my opinion although there are effects

416.949 --> 424.06
there are definitely things that happen

418.93 --> 428.289
even with those with these micro micro

424.06 --> 430.81
cellular things it does respond it does

428.289 --> 432.009
do things the body does actually create

430.81 --> 436.629
them out of nothing

432.009 --> 440.889
right and can be yeah but it's not yeah

436.629 --> 441.639
genetic marker right but it's also real

440.889 --> 443.939
much

441.639 --> 448.3
the genetic markers even really matter

443.939 --> 451.97900000000004
because I don't think like how can a

448.3 --> 457.96000000000004
certain genetic marker just pop up out

451.979 --> 461.979
of nothing without any contact like ever

457.96 --> 464.789
and this is also in my opinion one of

461.979 --> 468.81899999999996
the mysteries concerning the Spanish flu

464.789 --> 472.599
because it didn't just slowly go around

468.819 --> 476.319
no it almost hit everyone at the same

472.599 --> 486.52
time like it was incredible literally

476.319 --> 489.37
like a wave overcoming everything people

486.52 --> 491.349
barely even saw it coming and of course

489.37 --> 492.909
there's there was a niche as an

491.349 --> 495.93899999999996
elaborate media system and it was

492.909 --> 499.33
basically the news two more gold the

495.939 --> 502.18
people and they probably gave the best

499.33 --> 505.539
advice is just like yeah just make sure

502.18 --> 507.729
you got people guarding over you in in

505.539 --> 511.36
your worst fever conditions so you don't

507.729 --> 515.05
accidentally choke and vitamin C chicken

511.36 --> 516.82
soup and keep morale high that's it that

515.05 --> 522.519
is it it's what I've been saying from

516.82 --> 525.149
the start it's just that is the train

522.519 --> 528.76
the line of thinking that I route my

525.149 --> 530.41
approach in really and all that that in

528.76 --> 534.3389999999999
combination with the German new medicine

530.41 --> 536.23
approach the that lights the concept of

534.339 --> 539.86
viruses and infection in a whole

536.23 --> 546.49
different light in a much more holistic

539.86 --> 551.38
approach so yeah you you keep on

546.49 --> 554.17
persisting the the fear if it's coming

551.38 --> 557.98
it's coming the plague it's coming yeah

554.17 --> 562.11
you do that you keep on conjuring the

557.98 --> 566.6800000000001
spell hey if you believe it or not that

562.11 --> 569.5500000000001
is what it is and to me it's just

566.68 --> 569.55
another ball

576.52 --> 584.289
[Music]

600.64 --> 608.98
yeah yeah a ranty a ranty and what what

605.14 --> 611.86
if they tell you that 50% of their

608.98 --> 614.5600000000001
population has died and they showed a

611.86 --> 622.0600000000001
statistic for it ranty will you believe

614.56 --> 626.29
that - you seem to be thinking so -

622.06 --> 628.81
dimensionally it's like oh they must be

626.29 --> 631.54
hiding the numbers because the actual

628.81 --> 639.0999999999999
numbers are always hires because that is

631.54 --> 641.529
what the viral I just told me yeah well

639.1 --> 645.6700000000001
maybe the higher numbers are not

641.529 --> 648.1899999999999
actually lower than their the lower

645.67 --> 651.13
numbers are not actually lower they may

648.19 --> 653.44
be even more exaggerated from the zero

651.13 --> 655.51
point because it's just the flu and it's

653.44 --> 658.1800000000001
being overhyped to take control ever

655.51 --> 659.709
consider that oh really

658.18 --> 662.4399999999999
have you never seen a dead body before

659.709 --> 666.7299999999999
you know how many people die every year

662.44 --> 668.1300000000001
from the flu and bad colds when their

666.73 --> 671.13
body is in bad condition

668.13 --> 671.13
mm-hmm

678.89 --> 690.75
I'm not buying it Randy you can take all

688.17 --> 692.43
these schemes and and just find another

690.75 --> 694.9
crowd for it we'll buy it

692.43 --> 697.9399999999999
I am not buying it

694.9 --> 697.9399999999999
[Music]

703.27 --> 706.4499999999999
[Music]

722.01 --> 725.059
[Music]

729.52 --> 737.31
what do you mean Erwin Oh scheme

733.83 --> 740.1700000000001
coronavirus panic scheme fear porn

737.31 --> 742.3
wielding power over people's minds

740.17 --> 744.79
because you caught them in your spell of

742.3 --> 748.26
fear and they think you have something

744.79 --> 751.8
sensible to say about it that scheme

748.26 --> 751.8
ranty flat earth

774.17 --> 780.9499999999999
right because that aham that's actually

777.95 --> 782.71
I don't like you using caps but you

780.95 --> 785.7800000000001
actually said something sensible there

782.71 --> 790.33
because yeah the plagues in the Bible

785.78 --> 793.1899999999999
they describe famine yeah that's because

790.33 --> 797.48
the bodies in the bad condition and

793.19 --> 800.47
morale is low that is when this virus

797.48 --> 804.74
this effect that is part of our nature's

800.47 --> 806.45
metabolism a yearly cycle then is that

804.74 --> 808.34
is when it hits the heart and that is

806.45 --> 812.2700000000001
when it could potentially overcome

808.34 --> 817.4
almost anyone if everybody is in a bad

812.27 --> 820.3299999999999
condition and demoralized exactly so by

817.4 --> 824.36
creating more Fairport your are

820.33 --> 827.12
aggravating the conditions creating

824.36 --> 829.85
while potentially contributing to a

827.12 --> 832.52
psychosomatic critical mass mass

829.85 --> 842.5400000000001
hysteria that will cause the plague to

832.52 --> 846.0699999999999
actually hit yeah I see you darkness you

842.54 --> 851.03
can't escape my sight

846.07 --> 853.37
even if everywhere you are carrying with

851.03 --> 855.4
people even if they don't see it I see

853.37 --> 855.4
it

866.52 --> 869.62
[Music]

871.66 --> 878.54
prevention cure it's a metabolic process

875.71 --> 880.37
so if you just make sure that you're in

878.54 --> 882.68
a good condition and you have the right

880.37 --> 884.3
typical type of substances that involve

882.68 --> 887.0
metabolic healing in the first place

884.3 --> 891.13
like colloidal silver very good

887.0 --> 893.96
especially topically vitamin C overall

891.13 --> 896.57
immune system including viruses

893.96 --> 899.11
parasites everything it's good for the

896.57 --> 902.87
entire stability of your body right

899.11 --> 905.57
those two chicken soup typical for post

902.87 --> 907.88
fever restoration you need certain type

905.57 --> 911.74
of nourishment to restore yourself so

907.88 --> 914.63
you can't basically mutter on and

911.74 --> 917.86
potentially get trapped in some kind of

914.63 --> 920.93
new cycle because that can't happen and

917.86 --> 924.17
of course most important of all take it

920.93 --> 928.4899999999999
easy and get plenty of sleep don't think

924.17 --> 931.1899999999999
like well I'm sick but yeah I'll just

928.49 --> 933.74
sleep that six hours and then get back

931.19 --> 935.87
to work because I have to you know no

933.74 --> 937.61
matter what yeah if you're gonna do that

935.87 --> 942.26
and if you're gonna keep on doing that

937.61 --> 944.9
that'll actually that could potentially

942.26 --> 946.55
cause a big backlash even if you pump

944.9 --> 948.3199999999999
yourself full with all kinds of

946.55 --> 950.3599999999999
substance with good substances like

948.32 --> 953.09
vitamins you know even if you do that if

950.36 --> 954.77
you don't let your body have the period

953.09 --> 957.38
where it is not under constant stress

954.77 --> 959.66
that will have a great detriment on the

957.38 --> 962.93
healing process and will potentially not

959.66 --> 966.1
complete the cycle of the healing

962.93 --> 970.13
process it's very important to sleep and

966.1 --> 972.89
taking it easy it's critical keep that

970.13 --> 976.06
in mind so that is my advice the real

972.89 --> 980.36
advice in how to deal with this and

976.06 --> 983.66
whether it is before you catch it or

980.36 --> 989.09
after it always works keep it in mind

983.66 --> 992.38
don't forget it don't be fooled vaccines

989.09 --> 992.38
are not gonna work

995.95 --> 1003.1
if anything if anything just

998.72 --> 1007.029
theoretically theoretically this is kind

1003.1 --> 1010.66
of defining but I've seen fiafia just

1007.029 --> 1014.04
imagine that they could somehow they

1010.66 --> 1017.5889999999999
figured out a way to suppress the cold

1014.04 --> 1020.8
system from being able to be triggered

1017.589 --> 1024.459
like you could prevent having a common

1020.8 --> 1026.02
cold forever oh the common cold forever

1024.459 --> 1030.3700000000001
gone ooh

1026.02 --> 1033.4
seems great you never have to have to

1030.37 --> 1035.7399999999998
report in sick on work right Oh such a

1033.4 --> 1038.3190000000002
great idea well guess what will happen

1035.74 --> 1040.42
to people that take that if it would

1038.319 --> 1046.03
actually do as advertised

1040.42 --> 1048.6100000000001
remember well the cold metabolic process

1046.03 --> 1052.78
a cleaner process on a micro cellular

1048.61 --> 1056.83
level that does cleanup in unique ways

1052.78 --> 1060.67
that the normal standard system cannot

1056.83 --> 1062.1999999999998
process properly if you take that off if

1060.67 --> 1064.5700000000002
you take that out of the loop if you

1062.2 --> 1066.3400000000001
somehow block that process from being

1064.57 --> 1068.6499999999999
able to be triggered and you'll never

1066.34 --> 1072.33
get a cold again well there's a great

1068.65 --> 1075.8500000000001
likelihood that certain type of toxic

1072.33 --> 1078.79
wastes and blockages will start to pile

1075.85 --> 1081.01
up you could compare it roughly

1078.79 --> 1084.58
metaphorically to kidney stones it'll

1081.01 --> 1086.23
pile up and it'll one not be able to get

1084.58 --> 1087.85
away properly now of course with kidney

1086.23 --> 1091.84
stones you can actually externally do

1087.85 --> 1095.3799999999999
something to get that yet to resolve it

1091.84 --> 1098.35
and all that cleanses but yeah with this

1095.38 --> 1100.66
you need the cold process to basically

1098.35 --> 1104.76
start the cleanup well if you can't do

1100.66 --> 1109.26
that anymore because it's blocked yeah

1104.76 --> 1111.8799999999999
there's a chance you just I don't know

1109.26 --> 1113.29
depending on how well you live on what

1111.88 --> 1115.1200000000001
you're gonna absorb how much stress

1113.29 --> 1117.7
you're and they could potentially just

1115.12 --> 1122.86
be a sudden death collapse at some point

1117.7 --> 1125.66
because of a a niche toxic shock

1122.86 --> 1127.61
that'll just cognitively build up so

1125.66 --> 1129.98
that's yeah bit of science fiction

1127.61 --> 1133.78
concerning what would happen if they

1129.98 --> 1136.22
actually managed to block the the flu

1133.78 --> 1139.97
triggering mechanism and call it the

1136.22 --> 1144.38
cure to the to the flu the actual cure

1139.97 --> 1146.24
to the common cold and all that sorry

1144.38 --> 1149.0300000000002
I'm mixing up flu and the common colds

1146.24 --> 1153.19
it's but yeah it's theoretical just

1149.03 --> 1156.59
think about it think about it carefully

1153.19 --> 1159.5
this idea that the cold is a natural

1156.59 --> 1162.8899999999999
metabolic process it is not some kind of

1159.5 --> 1167.48
weird little irony are we nyan trinket

1162.89 --> 1170.0600000000002
there is whole studies about this people

1167.48 --> 1173.63
have been struggling against the the

1170.06 --> 1175.73
monstrous system of society to have

1173.63 --> 1179.3000000000002
there'll are two alternative approach

1175.73 --> 1184.1200000000001
just to be able to do it to expand it

1179.3 --> 1184.12
and to work it out they've had trouble

1185.14 --> 1189.94
so yeah

1193.24 --> 1199.28
yeah Randy flat earth yeah I know

1196.34 --> 1203.48
because it is a freaking project of the

1199.28 --> 1206.95
bank's its economic warfare how many

1203.48 --> 1211.16
[ __ ] times you ever tell you this

1206.95 --> 1213.8
it's economic warfare they decide this

1211.16 --> 1216.5600000000002
is the case they will close it down and

1213.8 --> 1218.33
there is [ __ ] all you can do about it

1216.56 --> 1221.48
and it has nothing to do with any

1218.33 --> 1228.6699999999998
freaking virus it is their control freak

1221.48 --> 1228.67
crackdown it's called punishment ranty

1230.92 --> 1234.67
you're getting it yet

1243.789 --> 1259.809
you're getting it yet buddy sorry to jar

1258.309 --> 1264.58
you with this ton I'm just getting

1259.809 --> 1267.129
really pissed off of this this [ __ ]

1264.58 --> 1271.499
that's coming from ranty who obviously

1267.129 --> 1271.4989999999998
doesn't get it or doesn't want to get it

1283.83 --> 1290.2289999999998
you think I don't know that potentially

1287.32 --> 1293.9089999999999
even my country could be subjected to

1290.229 --> 1299.229
this [ __ ] and I'd be absolutely screwed

1293.909 --> 1302.3200000000002
yeah me I'd be screwed absolutely

1299.229 --> 1305.039
screwed I could potentially die not from

1302.32 --> 1309.279
a freaking disease but from starvation

1305.039 --> 1310.989
or I don't know panic in a hunger

1309.279 --> 1313.989
situation who knows what the hell's

1310.989 --> 1317.32
gonna happen I don't know and that's why

1313.989 --> 1320.109
I'm spouting out the most hardcore

1317.32 --> 1322.749
[ __ ] truth that I can find in the

1320.109 --> 1325.809
situation in the hopes that will shine

1322.749 --> 1332.309
bright enough on to prevent a giant

1325.809 --> 1336.22
giant spell Cataclysm a giant death

1332.309 --> 1338.6789999999999
spiral Cataclysm because of this spell

1336.22 --> 1340.8990000000001
that is being unleashed on everyone and

1338.679 --> 1343.5590000000002
everyone is going with this spell while

1340.899 --> 1345.7289999999998
it is being used as a cover for

1343.559 --> 1348.7
potentially one of the most brutal

1345.729 --> 1350.769
crackdowns on Western society and more

1348.7 --> 1353.019
types of countries and what if we ever

1350.769 --> 1355.8990000000001
have seen punishment

1353.019 --> 1359.849
it's called punishment can you hear me

1355.899 --> 1359.849
Randy can you hear me

1387.51 --> 1394.77
yeah so you got your [ __ ] fair spiral

1391.44 --> 1397.3200000000002
now everybody all has an excuse to [ __ ]

1515.44 --> 1521.5700000000002
nobody tells me anything about freaking

1519.02 --> 1525.74
Auto hoaxing [ __ ] I don't pick up

1521.57 --> 1530.12
some outside narrative it's being hand

1525.74 --> 1535.16
down to me by a bunch of goons that just

1530.12 --> 1537.7399999999998
feed the cattle no I see I see right

1535.16 --> 1540.49
through it right through all the feeder

1537.74 --> 1543.11
II right through the construction I see

1540.49 --> 1547.01
you can't tell me I'm freaking out a

1543.11 --> 1551.059
hoaxing I'm exposing I'm shining the

1547.01 --> 1553.64
wrath of exposure real light shining

1551.059 --> 1557.1789999999999
right through all of it right through

1553.64 --> 1559.16
all of it maximum risk you can see all

1557.179 --> 1564.16
of it all what you're not supposed to

1559.16 --> 1566.5700000000002
and then you draw the conclusions then

1564.16 --> 1569.419
everybody then it sinks in what

1566.57 --> 1571.6399999999999
everybody's caught up in the decisions

1569.419 --> 1574.1000000000001
they've made what they're going with and

1571.64 --> 1576.8600000000001
what they might even be caught up

1574.1 --> 1578.75
believing lowering down their conscience

1576.86 --> 1581.4799999999998
in order to believe the foolishness they

1578.75 --> 1586.429
if they've contracted in their higher

1581.48 --> 1589.429
moments yeah literally signing a

1586.429 --> 1592.97
contract with the devil in the higher

1589.429 --> 1595.669
consciousness and then sink back from

1592.97 --> 1599.83
the higher consciousness in normal

1595.669 --> 1605.7700000000002
consciousness but bound by the contract

1599.83 --> 1609.6399999999999
yeah that's how it works you [ __ ] and

1605.77 --> 1609.6399999999999
I'm not doing it

1612.17 --> 1615.219
[Music]

1625.37 --> 1628.7399999999998
[Music]

1632.66 --> 1640.5
yes I bet I did

1635.58 --> 1650.48
ADM yeah sorry I wasn't planning to get

1640.5 --> 1653.13
pissed off but yeah anyway I've been

1650.48 --> 1655.1100000000001
looking around in media land everywhere

1653.13 --> 1657.1200000000001
pretty much blunt randy's although I put

1655.11 --> 1659.85
did fall by for a while until things got

1657.12 --> 1662.6
annoying again but man there's so many

1659.85 --> 1662.6
strange these days

1666.97 --> 1669.999
[Music]

1674.54 --> 1682.54
[Music]

1676.86 --> 1686.1899999999998
yeah dart stream always halfway

1682.54 --> 1699.37
interesting our Benjamin was crushing

1686.19 --> 1701.3500000000001
twice I think again there's so much good

1699.37 --> 1706.5
stuff going down a medial and now it's

1701.35 --> 1706.5
just pretty astounding and

1711.63 --> 1718.669
yes it makes me wonder like what did I

1715.62 --> 1722.25
get caught up in really this this

1718.669 --> 1724.41
awakening this revealing of myself that

1722.25 --> 1727.08
what I can do with my consciousness with

1724.41 --> 1732.78
that I can see why is it having a

1727.08 --> 1734.9399999999998
shockwave effect our people basically

1732.78 --> 1737.85
paying attention maybe even through

1734.94 --> 1740.76
their subconscious I don't know I don't

1737.85 --> 1742.83
know how much attention my presence is

1740.76 --> 1744.539
really catching but sometimes I get the

1742.83 --> 1751.47
feeling like the whole world is watching

1744.539 --> 1754.37
it is a crazy sensation okay like I used

1751.47 --> 1758.13
to think that that's purely because of

1754.37 --> 1760.86
like being overwhelmed from centuries in

1758.13 --> 1762.8700000000001
some way from but I'm not so sure

1760.86 --> 1766.74
anymore because I just see so many

1762.87 --> 1770.9699999999998
reflections of what I do in pretty much

1766.74 --> 1773.429
everything i watch and even even in just

1770.97 --> 1777.0
regular TV you can see there's like a

1773.429 --> 1778.919
shift he under all the layers of

1777.0 --> 1782.99
deception even there is some kind of

1778.919 --> 1787.0200000000002
shift it's it's just so astounding and

1782.99 --> 1788.73
it's just everywhere makes me

1787.02 --> 1790.679
enthusiastic but it also makes me a

1788.73 --> 1792.9
little bit scared because of the natural

1790.679 --> 1794.669
consequences of ascension as I've been

1792.9 --> 1797.88
trying to describe for a very long time

1794.669 --> 1799.7990000000002
as careful as I could what happens is

1797.88 --> 1803.96
when you just suddenly see things more

1799.799 --> 1806.309
clearly is you're confronted with

1803.96 --> 1808.919
uncomfortable details and thinks

1806.309 --> 1815.19
everything will effectively start to

1808.919 --> 1818.039
look more ugly and then if you are too

1815.19 --> 1821.8200000000002
black and white about it then you become

1818.039 --> 1823.679
a destroyer it's very yeah you become

1821.82 --> 1826.08
very disruptive because there are so

1823.679 --> 1833.21
many complex subtle processes so many

1826.08 --> 1838.559
gray areas out there so essentially is

1833.21 --> 1842.04
great because of the the real new ground

1838.559 --> 1843.96
it's like it it's like a new land rush

1842.04 --> 1844.35
of sudden lands it's just all this room

1843.96 --> 1847.169
all

1844.35 --> 1849.8999999999999
no maneuvering room but at the same time

1847.169 --> 1853.2800000000002
more polarization and that we've seen

1849.9 --> 1857.45
this the polarization and it's even been

1853.28 --> 1859.77
when you say like saddled the

1857.45 --> 1863.01
polarization as it arrived has all been

1859.77 --> 1865.95
saddled has all been put to work into

1863.01 --> 1871.549
specific like these groups versus these

1865.95 --> 1877.2
groups in this politics medical field in

1871.549 --> 1882.3899999999999
working class versus elite class and

1877.2 --> 1885.0
everywhere and yeah if everybody becomes

1882.39 --> 1887.159
more drawn out of their comfort zone

1885.0 --> 1889.71
effectively and because they see more

1887.159 --> 1892.409
and become more confronted then the risk

1889.71 --> 1895.89
of further polarization also puts more

1892.409 --> 1897.659
tension on everything and that's like

1895.89 --> 1900.0900000000001
the real risk of a session it is the

1897.659 --> 1902.75
greatest challenge it is literally what

1900.09 --> 1905.1589999999999
happens to an individual comparing it to

1902.75 --> 1908.34
certain moments that I experienced when

1905.159 --> 1910.5900000000001
you suddenly get all this power like

1908.34 --> 1914.25
extra inside a lot of confidence or

1910.59 --> 1918.8999999999999
extra money and like if it all combines

1914.25 --> 1924.09
then you just suddenly get overwhelmed

1918.9 --> 1926.2800000000002
and if you don't if you don't if you're

1924.09 --> 1928.049
not properly spiritually defended

1926.28 --> 1930.299
against the overwhelmingness of the

1928.049 --> 1933.4189999999999
power you may accidentally contract

1930.299 --> 1935.549
ideas that you may be some kind of a god

1933.419 --> 1937.8600000000001
or something that is kind of what

1935.549 --> 1942.179
happened it's like being overwhelmed and

1937.86 --> 1947.25
then the conscious decision making

1942.179 --> 1950.669
starts to make really weird ideas it's

1947.25 --> 1952.65
it's what I like to describe as Lucifer

1950.669 --> 1955.3500000000001
seducing you because of the overwhelming

1952.65 --> 1960.27
this of the power so it all ties back

1955.35 --> 1962.1
into metaphoric s-- as well but yeah

1960.27 --> 1964.46
that is kind of the bigger risk of the

1962.1 --> 1969.87
combined ascension of all people more

1964.46 --> 1973.08
polarization more tension but also the

1969.87 --> 1975.78
new ground new feet unfortunately new

1973.08 --> 1977.4499999999998
Grabill also new gravel they're always

1975.78 --> 1980.97
going to be a part of that

1977.45 --> 1984.75
everybody will or not everybody but like

1980.97 --> 1986.25
even if the old relic travelers as it

1984.75 --> 1988.74
were even if they'd fall away there

1986.25 --> 1990.54
would be new people that would just

1988.74 --> 1993.57
stand up they were always in the shadow

1990.54 --> 1995.82
waiting for the for the ancient ones to

1993.57 --> 2002.809
fall and then they'd take over it is

1995.82 --> 2006.08
what will happen forever until until

2002.809 --> 2008.57
maybe maybe until hopefully not until

2006.08 --> 2011.53
there becomes some you know like until

2008.57 --> 2015.32
the darkness is no longer allowed and

2011.53 --> 2018.35
until freedom is no longer allowed and

2015.32 --> 2020.9289999999999
then yeah then there would be a unified

2018.35 --> 2023.12
tyrannical mind and there would be no

2020.929 --> 2027.0800000000002
more being a human there would be no

2023.12 --> 2030.559
more UN experience nothing so let's hope

2027.08 --> 2033.3799999999999
that can never be allowed to transpire

2030.559 --> 2036.98
that our hysteria will never make us

2033.38 --> 2041.15
resort to the crazy notion that we must

2036.98 --> 2046.1
all unify minds out of out of some kind

2041.15 --> 2050.389
of threat like a worldwide ego threat

2046.1 --> 2057.23
response becoming oversimplified

2050.389 --> 2061.159
dangerous destructive anyway yeah I'm

2057.23 --> 2064.51
all over the place today let's calm it

2061.159 --> 2064.51
down and get back to Chet

2075.07 --> 2079.9300000000003
I could write some interesting

2076.87 --> 2082.93
literature I know I could but would that

2079.93 --> 2088.21
literature would some arbitrary story be

2082.93 --> 2090.0699999999997
worth the power of reality or would it

2088.21 --> 2092.86
be a waste to it and would it just be a

2090.07 --> 2096.1600000000003
distraction from the actual reality this

2092.86 --> 2101.28
is one of my subconscious fears that has

2096.16 --> 2104.3199999999997
prevented me from doing a lot of artwork

2101.28 --> 2108.15
from actually manifesting it because of

2104.32 --> 2108.15
I'm afraid of the consequences

2134.69 --> 2137.289
nope

2138.49 --> 2145.54
no paid 60 RMC he's contracted to the

2142.03 --> 2149.2900000000004
coronavirus he is there to use it in

2145.54 --> 2151.33
some way in some kind of way I think he

2149.29 --> 2155.8
probably hopped onto idea

2151.33 --> 2158.89
I think his dark buddy all right mr.

2155.8 --> 2162.4900000000002
fear porn himself I think he probably

2158.89 --> 2165.16
told him yeah yeah when the Corona fires

2162.49 --> 2167.3489999999997
hit then afterward we can use the

2165.16 --> 2170.17
outrage to topple the elite

2167.349 --> 2172.089
I think that's literally what that freak

2170.17 --> 2179.44
told him and he bought it

2172.089 --> 2182.89
gobbled it all up because ranty is kind

2179.44 --> 2185.56
of easily seduced when it comes to that

2182.89 --> 2187.18
it's very easily contracted in the

2185.56 --> 2194.56
higher conscious that's the problem with

2187.18 --> 2196.859
him playing the game I'm not playing

2194.56 --> 2196.859
that game

2203.32 --> 2206.55
[Music]

2228.09 --> 2234.2000000000003
Wow a gem really huh

2237.91 --> 2246.1
yeah well you know what in a way I do

2241.69 --> 2249.13
play the game but I don't play by their

2246.1 --> 2251.5
rules really but at the same time I try

2249.13 --> 2253.27
not to ruin their game too much because

2251.5 --> 2255.46
I know all of these people have

2253.27 --> 2259.42
basically invested in it one way or

2255.46 --> 2263.34
another and I don't as Owen Benjamin

2259.42 --> 2266.5
always says and it's it's insanely

2263.34 --> 2267.94
critical advice as ever and it is you

2266.5 --> 2271.66
gotta be careful in getting in people's

2267.94 --> 2275.86
way because if you take something from

2271.66 --> 2281.44
others then they will feel you owe them

2275.86 --> 2283.59
and I don't really want that so my

2281.44 --> 2289.7200000000003
approach from a very high consciousness

2283.59 --> 2292.96
perspective call me arrogant call me

2289.72 --> 2298.6299999999997
whatever you like my my universal

2292.96 --> 2301.45
solution was is to try to hold every

2298.63 --> 2303.94
group that is growing towards a dark

2301.45 --> 2306.96
mistake toward some kind of dark caught

2303.94 --> 2309.34
up in a spell in their own professions

2306.96 --> 2312.34
to halt that in their tracks and

2309.34 --> 2315.46
basically instead of then exposing and

2312.34 --> 2318.13
shaming them to no end like persecuting

2315.46 --> 2321.2400000000002
them for for their well witchcraft you

2318.13 --> 2327.19
can say for their magic for their spells

2321.24 --> 2331.4199999999996
instead kind of force them to to alter

2327.19 --> 2336.01
it and use spells in a more benevolent

2331.42 --> 2337.78
way a more subtle careful way so it

2336.01 --> 2340.6200000000003
actually has a good influence on the

2337.78 --> 2345.2400000000002
people that that's the whole thing

2340.62 --> 2348.7
that's and that way everybody can

2345.24 --> 2351.91
potentially be redeemed you just have to

2348.7 --> 2358.24
step away from the darkness and I have a

2351.91 --> 2360.2799999999997
belief in this I have a belief in in

2358.24 --> 2362.1699999999996
that in the people that make that choice

2360.28 --> 2364.6000000000004
to step away from the darkness and

2362.17 --> 2366.82
actually use the light and it's

2364.6 --> 2369.85
enlightenment and the deeper insight to

2366.82 --> 2371.3500000000004
kind of overcome the base conflicts that

2369.85 --> 2374.56
kept them stuck

2371.35 --> 2378.0099999999998
and then realize wait there's another

2374.56 --> 2382.35
way there is the middle way there is the

2378.01 --> 2382.3500000000004
other way in between Lucifer and Ahriman

2385.92 --> 2392.88
and that is kind of part of my principle

2417.39 --> 2424.5589999999997
right Marco bucks yes well hatred is

2421.369 --> 2427.4990000000003
kind of in on your inside so yeah if you

2424.559 --> 2429.9
if you latch on to hatred or even on to

2427.499 --> 2432.48
fear then yeah that will feed into

2429.9 --> 2438.7490000000003
demons and fear typically what if fear

2432.48 --> 2441.569
does is it it relieves you of certain

2438.749 --> 2445.14
levels of conscious in order to make

2441.569 --> 2449.73
more room for the safety mechanism but

2445.14 --> 2452.16
all that room is left and your

2449.73 --> 2454.68
subconscious and whatever dwells there

2452.16 --> 2456.6299999999997
whatever weird secret little ego plans

2454.68 --> 2459.779
you got covered up way in the back of

2456.63 --> 2462.96
your mind it may potentially use all

2459.779 --> 2464.73
that extra room from the the parts that

2462.96 --> 2468.059
are cut off from your personal conscious

2464.73 --> 2470.16
to do other things and this is also I

2468.059 --> 2472.8190000000004
believe part of the mechanism is what

2470.16 --> 2474.69
propels the ballers to be so

2472.819 --> 2480.18
perfectionist in their doublethink

2474.69 --> 2482.5190000000002
deception because they are basically out

2480.18 --> 2484.95
of control they have no no conscious

2482.519 --> 2487.049
control anymore really because they've

2484.95 --> 2490.1699999999996
lost and they can't let go and they're

2487.049 --> 2491.609
so in grief and fear and pain that in

2490.17 --> 2495.21
the process their consciousness just

2491.609 --> 2496.819
starts to drift away it starts to go to

2495.21 --> 2500.759
the back and there's just the automatic

2496.819 --> 2506.549
mechanisms that just take over do damage

2500.759 --> 2509.239
control until it's done it's all

2506.549 --> 2509.239
mechanisms

2519.47 --> 2522.52
[Music]

2524.54 --> 2530.16
Big Mike what

2527.37 --> 2533.0899999999997
my Columbo watch I don't know I don't

2530.16 --> 2533.0899999999997
know what that is sorry

2561.55 --> 2568.03
all right that's true Marco bags it's

2566.29 --> 2570.64
because they don't make it their highest

2568.03 --> 2572.05
priority because they just like to go

2570.64 --> 2576.91
around together around because it's

2572.05 --> 2579.9100000000003
easier I awareness is everything but

2576.91 --> 2584.23
easy that's the whole deal will you pick

2579.91 --> 2586.6299999999997
up the flame of Anor the true light not

2584.23 --> 2589.42
a limited light not a system that allows

2586.63 --> 2593.59
you to control within a certain time but

2589.42 --> 2598.09
the true light into the distance beyond

2593.59 --> 2600.73
control the light of honor will you

2598.09 --> 2604.92
wield it well it's a big freakin burden

2600.73 --> 2607.66
it's literally just stress

2604.92 --> 2610.9
so most people of course they'll go to

2607.66 --> 2612.8199999999997
as I describe they will send in their

2610.9 --> 2615.01
conscious moment to a higher and then

2612.82 --> 2618.01
together understanding and then they see

2615.01 --> 2621.0400000000004
oh wait I can do this that that I'll go

2618.01 --> 2623.65
this and they make the contracts in

2621.04 --> 2627.4
their minds and then they sick sink back

2623.65 --> 2630.1
into their regular busying therapy or

2627.4 --> 2633.46
whatever where they do well or their

2630.1 --> 2635.62
their personal concerns and that's how

2633.46 --> 2638.83
contracts spiritual contracts are made

2635.62 --> 2644.52
how people contract to something to a

2638.83 --> 2644.52
principle - to a concept - with scheme

2649.05 --> 2652.8590000000004
[Music]

2659.359 --> 2665.5789999999997
see all my conceptualizations they all

2662.67 --> 2668.75
fit in one another you could potentially

2665.579 --> 2671.849
take every example I did record it and

2668.75 --> 2673.38
when I get really descriptive record it

2671.849 --> 2675.63
in little pieces and put them all

2673.38 --> 2678.15
together if you don't think about it

2675.63 --> 2681.17
really carefully you'll see that this

2678.15 --> 2684.1800000000003
virtual model that I'm trying to explain

2681.17 --> 2690.9300000000003
framework by framework that it really is

2684.18 --> 2696.359
a unified whole it is a pattern and how

2690.93 --> 2698.16
it fits so well it's it's yeah as a

2696.359 --> 2700.2
whole it's too complicated to describe

2698.16 --> 2702.72
but you can just take out a piece by

2700.2 --> 2704.31
piece and piece and it just fits it's

2702.72 --> 2712.68
incredible

2704.31 --> 2715.74
I don't know how or well in a way I do

2712.68 --> 2718.04
know how but it is just so mystical it's

2715.74 --> 2718.04
just

2721.019 --> 2733.649
it's the deepest principles of design

2723.449 --> 2736.609
itself anyway I need to get back down to

2733.649 --> 2736.609
earth for a second

2758.319 --> 2761.669
I'm talking about weed

2765.049 --> 2774.38
yeah Oh in a way I realize also that in

2770.959 --> 2776.359
what I typically do on my show that it

2774.38 --> 2779.119
must be quite a challenge to some people

2776.359 --> 2782.569
that sometimes you know it may be like

2779.119 --> 2784.849
really picking up a level of pressure

2782.569 --> 2787.069
just trying to follow what I'm saying it

2784.849 --> 2789.38
is I bet it is pretty tense for some

2787.069 --> 2793.009
people to listen like well where is he

2789.38 --> 2796.609
gonna bring me now yeah I do realize it

2793.009 --> 2800.179
is it my show is not like oh let's just

2796.609 --> 2804.489
all relax no you're gonna be confronted

2800.179 --> 2805.7290000000003
with some mind-blowing stuff so it is

2804.489 --> 2808.64
yeah

2805.729 --> 2812.1189999999997
it's just the consequences of of insight

2808.64 --> 2814.0389999999998
it's the pressure the responsibilities

2812.119 --> 2815.8990000000003
that come with it and like can you

2814.039 --> 2819.759
handle it can you go there can you

2815.899 --> 2822.259
maintain it can you do it without

2819.759 --> 2828.739
instantly disrupting everything you've

2822.259 --> 2832.369
done up until that point can you figure

2828.739 --> 2835.309
out a way to carefully transition from

2832.369 --> 2838.609
the old way of you you doing things into

2835.309 --> 2841.279
the higher level because it's yeah

2838.609 --> 2844.609
you're gonna be left with people from

2841.279 --> 2847.339
your old world that suddenly make that

2844.609 --> 2849.229
did make no more sense to you that are

2847.339 --> 2851.779
just too caught up in their own nonsense

2849.229 --> 2853.6389999999997
and they can understand you anyway so

2851.779 --> 2856.489
there's no use for you even talking to

2853.639 --> 2858.679
them that kind of thing and that's the

2856.489 --> 2860.899
transition when you ascend in

2858.679 --> 2863.089
consciousness in level when you ascend

2860.899 --> 2864.8289999999997
the staircase you unfortunate you and

2863.089 --> 2869.169
fortunately you're gonna leave behind a

2864.829 --> 2873.3990000000003
lot but not everything and maybe some

2869.169 --> 2878.6299999999997
may actually see you ascending and

2873.399 --> 2881.3289999999997
carefully ascend with you or after some

2878.63 --> 2886.009
time try to catch up with you that can

2881.329 --> 2888.619
also happens so Omar Kovacs yeah sure we

2886.009 --> 2891.14
can talk on skype sometimes did you add

2888.619 --> 2895.569
me I think so

2891.14 --> 2895.569
but yeah we could talk that's no problem

2898.119 --> 2906.4100000000003
right so I'm probably going to talk

2903.259 --> 2909.65
about this a lot more as a as an

2906.41 --> 2911.989
esoteric example as a yeah as an

2909.65 --> 2915.849
esoteric example the the staircase the

2911.989 --> 2920.329
the infamous Freemason staircase right

2915.849 --> 2926.329
that has been kind of translated in many

2920.329 --> 2929.6600000000003
ways as the control pyramid each group

2926.329 --> 2932.619
controls the person on the next group

2929.66 --> 2935.239
well I'm gonna bypass that

2932.619 --> 2937.46
conceptualization and say no it is much

2935.239 --> 2940.279
more has to do with literally the level

2937.46 --> 2942.89
of consciousness where on the spectrum

2940.279 --> 2947.119
of consciousness are you and what is the

2942.89 --> 2948.799
natural result because as a very

2947.119 --> 2950.589
conscious person if you want to be

2948.799 --> 2956.089
responsible and not destroy everything

2950.589 --> 2959.8089999999997
you're kind of have to then take care

2956.089 --> 2963.109
Shepherd the cattle of those not ascend

2959.809 --> 2966.3190000000004
it around you make sure they don't get

2963.109 --> 2972.489
damaged by the specific insights you've

2966.319 --> 2975.23
gained see and I think that that that

2972.489 --> 2978.4700000000003
conceptualization is what the staircase

2975.23 --> 2982.67
really is much more about and the

2978.47 --> 2985.8799999999997
grabbers have simply reverse engineered

2982.67 --> 2991.91
it to make it all about control and

2985.88 --> 2995.989
power and authoritarianism they reverse

2991.91 --> 3001.359
engineered the very map of consciousness

2995.989 --> 3005.079
itself into a control system for us to

3001.359 --> 3009.97
believe in and they may have even

3005.079 --> 3013.0190000000002
literally utilized it the that concept

3009.97 --> 3013.019
on their own

3014.61 --> 3023.1
ever realize that that the ladder the

3020.45 --> 3026.46
staircase of the Freemason may simply be

3023.1 --> 3030.24
about the level of consciousness how far

3026.46 --> 3032.6
can you see what can you grip how much

3030.24 --> 3032.6
can you handle

3051.35 --> 3054.79
[Music]

3064.0 --> 3076.28
so they hide it in plain sight what they

3068.66 --> 3080.81
basically did is they took a very

3076.28 --> 3084.1400000000003
powerful graph of data do you understand

3080.81 --> 3086.3289999999997
like a graphics say like the economics

3084.14 --> 3090.3799999999997
graphics or whatever they took a graph

3086.329 --> 3094.4500000000003
of consciousness of the spirit

3090.38 --> 3098.77
consciousness and the consequences and

3094.45 --> 3101.39
then they made a science fiction story

3098.77 --> 3104.119
squished it on top of it look oh it's a

3101.39 --> 3107.72
mighty control mechanism ooh the evil

3104.119 --> 3109.82
world so dangerous and they painted it

3107.72 --> 3112.3999999999996
they basically just violated the

3109.82 --> 3114.65
painting and made their own science

3112.4 --> 3120.67
fiction version on top of its framework

3114.65 --> 3124.7000000000003
that's basically what they've done and

3120.67 --> 3127.569
that's what we got presented with fear

3124.7 --> 3127.569
porn and Sue

3134.119 --> 3139.7690000000002
altered carbon what is that is that some

3137.309 --> 3141.7200000000003
series I don't really watch those series

3139.769 --> 3144.839
you know i I've heard of all those

3141.72 --> 3146.0499999999997
carbon I think but it's not I've not

3144.839 --> 3149.169
watched it

3146.05 --> 3149.1690000000003
[Music]

3177.39 --> 3180.14
okay

3205.72 --> 3208.7099999999996
waitwhat

3226.26 --> 3241.65
right yeah I think I've I feel like I

3235.059 --> 3241.65
spend a lot of energy today who are you

3253.03 --> 3261.73
so yeah I think I'm gonna round out to

3258.95 --> 3261.73
show pretty soon

3289.3 --> 3298.3
what huh the consciousness the transfer

3296.2 --> 3301.83
of consciousness from one sleeve to

3298.3 --> 3305.28
another that's it that's very clever I

3301.83 --> 3305.2799999999997
like that

3312.99 --> 3326.16
okay okay base 60 RMC I appreciate the

3318.599 --> 3329.9100000000003
intent let's hope it'll never be really

3326.16 --> 3332.0989999999997
necessary look I'm really gonna set my

3329.91 --> 3337.5
trust I'm just having freaking chicken

3332.099 --> 3342.57
soup or whatever maybe in a way I should

3337.5 --> 3346.91
just stack up on that you know as long

3342.57 --> 3351.69
as I can get water out of the tap and

3346.91 --> 3354.5099999999998
basically and some electricity and just

3351.69 --> 3357.15
have huge stocks of chicken soup

3354.51 --> 3359.94
I'd probably survive for a year is this

3357.15 --> 3362.76
all the other I get like bored out of my

3359.94 --> 3375.17
mind I'd start cackling cackling like a

3362.76 --> 3379.38
chicken after a few weeks though but

3375.17 --> 3384.03
anyway I appreciate the the intent I

3379.38 --> 3386.4300000000003
look some technically financial help if

3384.03 --> 3389.4900000000002
you guys can must you guys and girls can

3386.43 --> 3393.1499999999996
master it it may help me actually to to

3389.49 --> 3395.49
stock up on some stuff I could the

3393.15 --> 3398.55
problem so far is that I just didn't
