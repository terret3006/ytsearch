sniffles here and there but not a very

60.66 --> 69.21
sunny Sunday so yeah yesterday was a

67.65 --> 74.39

76.76 --> 83.93
travel and all that stuff and yeah I

79.82 --> 88.30999999999999
almost like to get that back because it

83.93 --> 90.97900000000001

105.26 --> 113.66000000000001
anything it's totally open and yeah we

111.2 --> 118.61
can make this hangout the yeah pretty

113.66 --> 121.67
long to just like it yesterday if it

118.61 --> 123.68
comes to that although just on my own

121.67 --> 126.82000000000001
that's probably not gonna happen that

123.68 --> 129.739
long so let's see you as in check

126.82 --> 133.54999999999998
lots of people hacker dwells stop

129.739 --> 140.38
trafficking my rest I had Voynich Nathan

133.55 --> 140.38000000000002
Oakley Steve Nick over McCool

140.66 --> 149.29
Sean Becker Julie Bennett yeah good to

146.84 --> 149.29
see you all

154.28 --> 159.63
so

156.75 --> 160.2
I managed to get myself to go to bed

159.63 --> 163.07999999999998
early

160.2 --> 169.67999999999998
although I kind of did have to cheat to

163.08 --> 172.05
do it a bit because yeah I'm still in

169.68 --> 175.77
that mood to stay up pretty late but I

172.05 --> 178.62
also know that when I drink wine for

175.77 --> 181.74
example in the evening then eventually

178.62 --> 182.46
I'll just run out of steam so that's

181.74 --> 185.52
what I did

182.46 --> 189.72
had some fun mostly during Martin Lucas

185.52 --> 192.51000000000002
hangout which was an absolute blast was

189.72 --> 194.46
really cool live stream yeah he does a

192.51 --> 196.01999999999998
lot of premieres but yeah this time he

194.46 --> 197.79000000000002
didn't live stream and it was awesome

196.02 --> 200.66
it's just really good when you can

197.79 --> 204.23999999999998
directly interact through chat that way

200.66 --> 208.07999999999998
it was really cool and I had a few

204.24 --> 212.52
drinks and so I went that early because

208.08 --> 216.11
of that as yes kind of cheating now next

212.52 --> 216.11
time I'm gonna try to do that without

218.86 --> 223.23000000000002
although yasiel pretty good I didn't

220.81 --> 223.23
overdo it

225.44 --> 232.25
just too bad about this weather I would

230.12 --> 238.06
have really appreciated some Sun but oh

232.25 --> 246.85
well this time of year can't always have

238.06 --> 246.85
vacation whether you know snow fire

249.55 --> 256.54900000000004
yeah the ads are adapted to the to the

253.88 --> 260.2
person watching so if you're from India

256.549 --> 264.14
then you'll very likely have Indian

260.2 --> 267.56
advertisements showing as do when I

264.14 --> 270.5
watch advertisements there are a lot of

267.56 --> 272.69
Dutch advertisements like a lot of them

270.5 --> 275.09
actually most of them are Dutch

272.69 --> 278.45
advertisements so the advertisements are

275.09 --> 280.65999999999997
always adapted to the viewer not to the

278.45 --> 280.65999999999997
show

282.4 --> 294.969
yeah and I don't use ad locker I don't

288.61 --> 294.969
add blockers actually bad for a channel

296.879 --> 303.24
just you know just get them [ __ ] it's

301.379 --> 306.749
not that hard when is it in like five

303.24 --> 310.169
seconds usually it's very rarely you

306.749 --> 313.91900000000004
have to watch a full-out advertisement

310.169 --> 318.719
they only really do that when they think

313.919 --> 324.05899999999997
oh it's like really really good video so

318.719 --> 328.49899999999997
we will put that in there but mostly you

324.059 --> 330.689
just get like a pop-up thing down at the

328.499 --> 333.53900000000004
bottom that's usually how to do it

330.689 --> 336.509
standard advertisement and come on how

333.539 --> 339.199
much is that in the way really I don't

336.509 --> 339.199
use ad blocker

347.96 --> 357.34999999999997
right and with the VPN thing or tor if

353.84 --> 363.44
you're using that then yeah you will get

357.35 --> 366.56
ads adapted to the the sock location

363.44 --> 369.21999999999997
that you're doing it from so yeah that

366.56 --> 369.22
that happens

372.71 --> 378.349
I've been thinking about VPN also

375.78 --> 381.69
although yeah it's not for free

378.349 --> 386.21999999999997
but yeah since I may be getting a credit

381.69 --> 388.59
card pretty soon and plan to order

386.22 --> 391.8
things with it online as well

388.59 --> 394.08
I might need VPN because that's what it

391.8 --> 400.639
primarily seems to be aimed at making

394.08 --> 406.979
sure that nobody snatches the there's a

400.639 --> 409.62
credit card code when you use it I'm not

406.979 --> 411.419
too sure though I I need to be a little

409.62 --> 414.919
bit more informed but yeah I definitely

411.419 --> 419.479
don't want that to happen so we'll see

414.919 --> 419.479
all right share the show yep

420.62 --> 432.83
a dearth of the bird Sunday morning but

428.75 --> 435.5
yeah look especially for my show at this

432.83 --> 440.0
point I would really appreciate it if

435.5 --> 444.47
you guys did not use ad blocker I know

440.0 --> 446.66
it's annoying but thing is the more you

444.47 --> 449.93
people actually click on advertisements

446.66 --> 452.15000000000003
and all that's [ __ ] even though yeah you

449.93 --> 455.6
don't really want to probably mostly

452.15 --> 461.40999999999997
most of the time but it will bring in

455.6 --> 465.59000000000003
like this standard revenue for me for

461.41 --> 468.98
for my youtube channel and that will

465.59 --> 471.95
eventually allow me to get to that

468.98 --> 475.52000000000004
threshold of 70 euros which is purely

471.95 --> 479.18
based on the ad revenue and not on the

475.52 --> 481.64
super chat donation so yeah in order for

479.18 --> 483.95
me to get access to all those super chat

481.64 --> 486.8
donations I need to get there first so

483.95 --> 489.83
yeah the more you guys help me out by

486.8 --> 492.26
actually not using ad blocker and and

489.83 --> 495.2
yeah against better judgement click on

492.26 --> 497.57
those ads the quicker I will be able to

495.2 --> 501.02
get access to the super chat donations

497.57 --> 502.76
so think about that you know it doesn't

501.02 --> 505.64
have to go on forever I just need to

502.76 --> 507.59
reach that threshold and the sooner the

505.64 --> 509.81
better because yeah for now I'll be

507.59 --> 512.42
super chat well that's super chat money

509.81 --> 514.51
is just sitting there in YouTube's fault

512.42 --> 518.42
and I can't do anything with him

514.51 --> 522.23
until I reach that 70 euro threshold for

518.42 --> 524.5999999999999
ad revenue so just think about that if

522.23 --> 525.95
you want to help me out that's a good

524.6 --> 528.23
way to do it

525.95 --> 530.2090000000001
and yeah you're not gonna have to do

528.23 --> 532.82
that like forever only until I reach

530.209 --> 537.8
that threshold I don't know how long it

532.82 --> 541.339
will take but yeah you use ad blocker

537.8 --> 543.79
then it's gonna take longer so just

541.339 --> 543.7900000000001
think about that

546.96 --> 553.83
for that talk about Martin litas hangout

549.75 --> 556.56
yesterday it was awesome I sent him an

553.83 --> 560.5500000000001
email by the way I mentioned that that

556.56 --> 562.5
is the way to get the materials because

560.55 --> 566.43
yeah through YouTube doesn't work so

562.5 --> 568.02
well I mean through Skype I did that I

566.43 --> 570.779
still have to check it you know it

568.02 --> 572.61
probably gets a lot of emails but would

570.779 --> 574.23
be awesome because I basically asked him

572.61 --> 580.95
like can you send me some of those

574.23 --> 583.08
ancient very old hidden history books in

580.95 --> 585.3000000000001
Dutch because they were in all Dutch and

583.08 --> 588.5400000000001
I can actually read that it's not that

585.3 --> 591.209
difficult and I can read it and actually

588.54 --> 593.61
translate it on the spot to English and

591.209 --> 596.0699999999999
that will be very interesting endeavor

593.61 --> 599.82
for me to do with it just like do a

596.07 --> 602.88
specific hangout like look this book I'm

599.82 --> 604.74
gonna read it first in Dutch the right

602.88 --> 607.92
way and then I'm gonna directly

604.74 --> 610.64
translate every piece of it to English

607.92 --> 613.709
for you guys on the spot I can do that

610.64 --> 616.709
you know I'm good at languages I can do

613.709 --> 619.41
that translating Dutch to English is

616.709 --> 621.8699999999999
like the foundation talent that I have

619.41 --> 627.6899999999999
I've worked on it my entire life so I

621.87 --> 629.22
can do that so yeah I hope I get access

627.69 --> 632.6700000000001
to some of these books that would be

629.22 --> 636.45
very cool yeah German not so much

632.67 --> 640.5889999999999
unfortunate like I can sort of make out

636.45 --> 642.779
German as in from one third to two

640.589 --> 647.2790000000001
thirds of German I can pretty much

642.779 --> 649.23
figure out what it's saying but I yeah

647.279 --> 651.54
there's always going to be missing gaps

649.23 --> 653.49
and then they'll gonna have to look up

651.54 --> 655.8
the words and it's gonna take so much

653.49 --> 657.45
longer I can do it live on the spot with

655.8 --> 659.3
Dutch and all Dutch however it's gonna

657.45 --> 663.26
be very easy for me

659.3 --> 668.3299999999999
very easy so just an idea all right

663.26 --> 671.149
also yeah a bit of a mean mean time it's

668.33 --> 674.7090000000001
so funny how Martin like has brought up

671.149 --> 678.62
this new word that he uses the juice

674.709 --> 680.66
he's got the juice and we all know what

678.62 --> 684.8
it means is like the fuel the fuel for

680.66 --> 687.35
the spirit that which drives us and

684.8 --> 691.76
drives our curiosity I love I love how

687.35 --> 696.649
he says it got the juice so I thought

691.76 --> 701.209
yeah I'm gonna make I'm kind of a kind

696.649 --> 703.55
of a parody parody picture of it which

701.209 --> 705.4399999999999
has like multiple layers of

703.55 --> 708.38
interpretation because I always do that

705.44 --> 715.5100000000001
[ __ ] so I'm gonna present that for a

708.38 --> 715.51
moment you figure it out oh yeah

715.87 --> 721.6
Martin's got the juice thrashing through

719.269 --> 721.6
the wall

723.91 --> 729.77
now you can of course since it is the

727.459 --> 733.0999999999999
kool-aid guy which is based on say

729.77 --> 736.43
overuse got the kool-aid yeah but that's

733.1 --> 738.1700000000001
kind of an intentional side effect so it

736.43 --> 739.279
could be interpreted in a trollish way

738.17 --> 741.2299999999999
but it yeah

739.279 --> 745.209
it's talking about the juice he's got

741.23 --> 749.11
the juice he crashes through the wall so

745.209 --> 749.1099999999999
Martin's got the juice

751.45 --> 761.88
love you Martin keep up the awesome work

755.1 --> 765.97
try not to drown in it all and yeah I

761.88 --> 768.24
definitely will call out wide to support

765.97 --> 773.1700000000001
this guy because yeah it's a lot of work

768.24 --> 777.34
what he does and if you wanted yeah if

773.17 --> 779.4699999999999
you wanted work that intense then he's

777.34 --> 781.6
gonna have to get some financial support

779.47 --> 784.47
because yeah it takes up all the time

781.6 --> 787.0
and you can't like get a job beside that

784.47 --> 791.0500000000001
don't know he does that kind of thing I

787.0 --> 795.13
think I don't but yeah if you want his

791.05 --> 797.5899999999999
full dedication if you want to if you

795.13 --> 800.89
want the juice all the time then

797.59 --> 801.82
financially support him yeah yes say

800.89 --> 805.66
that did happen

801.82 --> 811.0300000000001
got London Nations good also yeah it's

805.66 --> 814.6899999999999
funny thing a bit of alchemy talk here

811.03 --> 819.9599999999999
so yeah super jet donation its cash and

814.69 --> 826.6
we all know that cash is like dirt it's

819.96 --> 829.6
it's the dirt of the earth sign you

826.6 --> 833.59
consider juice the juice that's kind of

829.6 --> 836.74
that could be considered water so super

833.59 --> 841.12
chat donation plus juice was that gonna

836.74 --> 845.53
make it's gonna make mud so super chat

841.12 --> 846.02
donations plus juice is mud flood that

845.53 --> 851.99
was

846.02 --> 855.98
kind of appropriate yeah it's spamming

851.99 --> 858.86
that in this chat right am i - yeah yeah

855.98 --> 861.9200000000001
good stuff I'm gonna hang out yesterday

858.86 --> 863.99
up to see that more I love when he's

861.92 --> 866.24
live streaming I think he's doing a lot

863.99 --> 875.57
better even than he's doing the

866.24 --> 877.99
premieres so yeah go and subscribe to

875.57 --> 877.99
Martinique

883.69 --> 890.59
oh yeah also a bit of a short mention

887.56 --> 895.4499999999999
was kind of disappointing but look back

890.59 --> 897.46
this morning to Owen Benjamin in the

895.45 --> 901.1800000000001
reports and he had like several things

897.46 --> 904.09
and they were all blocked and that was

901.18 --> 907.4499999999999
just so annoying and unfair because

904.09 --> 911.2
apparently he wanted to show a stand-up

907.45 --> 915.4300000000001
comedy skit he made with his old friend

911.2 --> 919.0
that fortunately committed suicide like

915.43 --> 922.12
a few weeks ago and YouTube just didn't

919.0 --> 925.15
allow it and yeah he ended up with like

922.12 --> 927.43
a seven minute hangout and he cut it off

925.15 --> 932.56
because he was so frustrated that they

927.43 --> 935.68
that YouTube just directly refused to

932.56 --> 938.38
let him show his skit that he was a part

935.68 --> 940.75
of like he is in it and he can't even

938.38 --> 944.37
show it on YouTube and it's outrageous I

940.75 --> 944.37
think it's outrageous that they did that

944.49 --> 951.67
it's like shame on you YouTube how dare

947.53 --> 955.3299999999999
you how dare you not let somebody show a

951.67 --> 959.88
video which he himself is a part of how

955.33 --> 959.88
can you do that it's just

960.51 --> 963.62
just sick

964.12 --> 972.339
so yeah too bad that that thing was cut

967.089 --> 974.35
short it's really too bad because on

972.339 --> 983.0500000000001
Benjamin is like really awesome long

974.35 --> 985.6800000000001
hangouts really on the edge of comedy so

983.05 --> 985.68
yeah too bad

993.01 --> 1003.41
so yeah about upload my video if you

998.68 --> 1006.75
like it let's get in already with that

1003.41 --> 1009.7199999999999
and yeah share the show again like this

1006.75 --> 1011.61
is this show is gonna last I'll do it

1009.72 --> 1015.9300000000001
for a while I I got an appointment with

1011.61 --> 1018.63
Hagrid Wells in before the evening gonna

1015.93 --> 1022.019

things anything I'm all up for it and

1078.36 --> 1083.6999999999998
anyone in the panel you know except for

1081.45 --> 1087.74
like the really trollish rollers but

1083.7 --> 1092.4
they'll never come on a panel anyway

1087.74 --> 1095.13
yeah Colin Turner I had a new mic and it

1092.4 --> 1097.3500000000001
turned out to be broken and that sucks

1095.13 --> 1100.41
and I'm really pissed off at it I sent

1097.35 --> 1103.02
it back the very day because I checked

1100.41 --> 1106.2
that hang out I did with it and the

1103.02 --> 1107.94
sound was all in and out in and out in

1106.2 --> 1110.7
and out totally random

1107.94 --> 1113.04
didn't make any damn sense it was wasted

1110.7 --> 1115.77
the entire hangout was wasted because of

1113.04 --> 1118.3799999999999
it I double-checked it through Skype did

1115.77 --> 1120.53
the same damn thing so there's like this

1118.38 --> 1124.46
regulator in there and it's broken

1120.53 --> 1124.46
so I sent it back in

1124.849 --> 1131.989
all right yeah Hagrid well said he he

1127.859 --> 1137.4289999999999
showed me he had a basic mic thingy and

1131.989 --> 1140.1290000000001
yeah he's yeah it doesn't really mean it

1137.429 --> 1142.499
says so he's offered up to give it to me

1140.129 --> 1146.009
I'll try it out it's really basic mic

1142.499 --> 1148.32
well I'm not as basic this thing which

1146.009 --> 1152.879
is the most basic mic in existence

1148.32 --> 1156.529
probably but sure I'll try out that

1152.879 --> 1156.529
thing see if how that sounds

1156.859 --> 1160.609
we good to try out

1174.17 --> 1182.5700000000002
right yeah this mic does seems to be

1177.5 --> 1186.02
seem to be a little bit noisy and it has

1182.57 --> 1189.26
and it is low in volume for some reason

1186.02 --> 1194.96
it's just like it works but it's only

1189.26 --> 1197.24
five euros okay it's basically a simple

1194.96 --> 1202.88
mic in a piece of plastic that's it

1197.24 --> 1205.13
that's it there's nothing yeah

1202.88 --> 1207.14
dynamic design or anything to account

1205.13 --> 1209.39
for how sound works now it's just the

1207.14 --> 1213.71
freakin basic mic and get more basic

1209.39 --> 1216.2
than this so yeah can't complain about

1213.71 --> 1218.96
something that is almost practically

1216.2 --> 1221.3
free but yeah I would be good to have a

1218.96 --> 1224.68
better mic so I hope I'll try out

1221.3 --> 1224.68
Hagrid's mic

1225.38 --> 1233.43
hmm hey Turner they cheap mics better

1230.1 --> 1235.9199999999998
than no mic at all right and this thing

1233.43 --> 1240.02
okay this silly little mic has been

1235.92 --> 1244.71
functioning for two and a half years now

1240.02 --> 1247.59
it hasn't broken down so yeah look if

1244.71 --> 1248.43
something doesn't break that's

1247.59 --> 1249.87
incredible

1248.43 --> 1251.97
if it's cheap and it doesn't break

1249.87 --> 1257.6299999999999
that's just really good even though the

1251.97 --> 1260.76
quality is kind of shitty you know so

1257.63 --> 1262.14
not complaining about this mic but yeah

1260.76 --> 1265.47
I definitely would like to have a little

1262.14 --> 1270.26
bit better sound quality it is what it

1265.47 --> 1274.47

1647.48 --> 1653.77
long time hey that sounds to say fine

1651.56 --> 1653.77
with that

1660.38 --> 1669.23
hmm just can't be here where's Lucy

1665.21 --> 1669.23
let's see Caribbean here

1675.39 --> 1683.47
yeah yes sometimes YouTube just starts

1678.79 --> 1688.71
to like do the twirly thing and yeah

1683.47 --> 1688.71
just reload and it worked

1690.69 --> 1695.999
unfortunately I'm not having severe

1692.82 --> 1698.399
connection problems but yeah is it like

1695.999 --> 1701.159
City territory in the Netherlands so

1698.399 --> 1704.849
internet here is all pretty damn fast

1701.159 --> 1707.759
I got pure landlines only so there's no

1704.849 --> 1710.07
Wi-Fi disruption or blah blah blah it's

1707.759 --> 1712.229
all just a big landline on the fast

1710.07 --> 1715.499
internet connection so I rarely rarely

1712.229 --> 1717.3890000000001
have streaming problems usually it's

1715.499 --> 1718.979
like the connection gets interrupted or

1717.389 --> 1721.2589999999998
something that's really annoying when

1718.979 --> 1723.659
that happens but there's no low

1721.259 --> 1725.909
bandwidth issues ever pretty much

1723.659 --> 1734.2990000000002
haven't had any of those since I started

1725.909 --> 1734.2990000000002
doing YouTube live streams alright yeah

1734.629 --> 1740.549
while Karen didn't really make the

1737.34 --> 1742.9499999999998
jingle but she did help do the text

1740.549 --> 1745.769
animation for it indeed indeed she did

1742.95 --> 1748.759
very thankful for that thanks again

1745.769 --> 1748.759
Karen B for doing that

1756.38 --> 1764.19
all right so what's happening I'm gonna

1761.279 --> 1773.929
fish in chat to see if there's anything

1764.19 --> 1773.929
to talk about Wi-Fi amorous right

1794.36 --> 1798.399
Oh goddess which Bella

1799.82 --> 1806.509
flat earth see some new people in chat

1803.239 --> 1812.41

1819.4 --> 1823.14
me say i'll only the wise

1824.999 --> 1827.6290000000001
Decker

1828.77 --> 1832.3
Steve right

1842.14 --> 1850.0
well rust I had is probably up very late

1845.53 --> 1852.96
still from yesterday or did you get up

1850.0 --> 1852.96
really early this time

1866.23 --> 1874.71
oh you did get Hurley nice nice good

1870.57 --> 1874.71
much healthier to do it like that

1878.48 --> 1883.45
yeah I'm trying to do that as well

1886.06 --> 1892.72
much better to sleep Suns down and be

1890.68 --> 1894.16
awake and the Sun is up even if it is

1892.72 --> 1898.42
kind of behind the clouds

1894.16 --> 1901.77
just better and yeah you do get to catch

1898.42 --> 1901.77
the worm that way

1905.9 --> 1913.7
yeah and I do yeah look I feel I feel

1908.57 --> 1916.49
great I've been going better last few

1913.7 --> 1918.5900000000001
days and yesterday's seems like there

1916.49 --> 1919.64
was a switch again and things work

1918.59 --> 1922.4599999999998
differently now

1919.64 --> 1925.159
metabolic wise so yeah I'm feeling great

1922.46 --> 1927.89
I'm like ready for spring I'm doing a

1925.159 --> 1931.159
bit of workouts here and there yeah

1927.89 --> 1934.97
not super strong yet been taking a lot

1931.159 --> 1937.1000000000001
of fish oil also and that does help and

1934.97 --> 1940.309
it's funny because like even ten years

1937.1 --> 1944.4189999999999
ago when I was with my ex living with

1940.309 --> 1947.51
her I I knew like yeah fish oil

1944.419 --> 1951.26
it helps against the depression very

1947.51 --> 1953.36
vividly and I needed it back then

1951.26 --> 1955.75
because I was still going through weird

1953.36 --> 1955.75
[ __ ]

1956.47 --> 1964.5
I have been taking it pretty much

1961.57 --> 1967.6899999999998
continually except for a few moments

1964.5 --> 1970.42
especially last year when I just ran out

1967.69 --> 1973.3600000000001
of money and just decided like yeah this

1970.42 --> 1976.8100000000002
is it's not gonna work but I'm gonna try

1973.36 --> 1982.4399999999998
to do it without and then apparently

1976.81 --> 1985.57
that didn't do too well with me so I am

1982.44 --> 1987.99
yeah getting more fish oil and it works

1985.57 --> 1987.99
really well

1998.39 --> 2004.2

panel first

2296.63 --> 2303.77
right Oliver Farney good question I'm

2300.23 --> 2305.96
not entirely sure yet but it seems like

2303.77 --> 2309.77
globe Buster's videos are down due to

2305.96 --> 2311.6
copyright issues oh yeah

2309.77 --> 2313.64
it's my it's probably just set to

2311.6 --> 2321.2799999999997
private and they're figuring out how to

2313.64 --> 2327.92
replace the now copyrighted stuff that's

2321.28 --> 2329.57
what I gathered from from people yeah at

2327.92 --> 2331.7000000000003
first I thought like oh my god he just

2329.57 --> 2337.9
deleted everything or something that

2331.7 --> 2337.8999999999996
crazy but yeah it's very unlikely

2338.05 --> 2346.1000000000004
although I haven't heard anything from

2340.97 --> 2348.1099999999997

2346.1 --> 2350.44

it

2366.34 --> 2372.8700000000003
stone monkey 3d yeah you've been

2368.86 --> 2378.31
haunting my comment sections with your

2372.87 --> 2382.96
innate questions knowing yeah what I

2378.31 --> 2387.04
think about baller tests is they're

2382.96 --> 2391.62
usually presuppositional based and they

2387.04 --> 2391.62
don't cut anything really

2396.46 --> 2400.69
it's just fooling around suggesting a

2398.83 --> 2404.14
ball that's what it's become for ballers

2400.69 --> 2407.35
now there's very little you can do at

2404.14 --> 2413.04
this point to basically prove your ball

2407.35 --> 2420.85
some way it's it's just fooling around

2413.04 --> 2428.56
playing around all right question about

2420.85 --> 2431.29
conferences you can see that a question

2428.56 --> 2434.67
about conferences right so what is your

2431.29 --> 2434.67
question about conferences

2450.25 --> 2457.34
what so what is your question type it

2453.98 --> 2460.03
out right now I'm gonna move on and

2457.34 --> 2460.03
ignore you

2467.02 --> 2474.82
think they will be infiltrated well how

2470.65 --> 2476.6800000000003
is that gonna happen how are you gonna

2474.82 --> 2478.57
infiltrate a conference what do you

2476.68 --> 2482.8489999999997
think like some outsiders gonna pay for

2478.57 --> 2485.8300000000004
a ticket to go there and then troll it I

2482.849 --> 2488.9500000000003
think they're gonna like do an ante [ __ ]

2485.83 --> 2491.71
kind of shitty thing on us like well

2488.95 --> 2495.22
these people are all insane protests

2491.71 --> 2497.23
this must be shut that really think

2495.22 --> 2501.2999999999997
people are gonna pay money just to do

2497.23 --> 2505.44
that that will be kind of silly and yeah

2501.3 --> 2508.869
do you think flat earthers that everyone

2505.44 --> 2512.56
trust that the organization trusts are

2508.869 --> 2516.31
gonna like switch around in the middle

2512.56 --> 2520.599
of the conference and subtly do

2516.31 --> 2524.02
something crazy or actually go pro ball

2520.599 --> 2525.4900000000002
yeah that's gonna not last very long if

2524.02 --> 2527.65
they do that yeah they might get like a

2525.49 --> 2531.339
moment of attention out of nowhere

2527.65 --> 2538.869
and they'll never be invited to a

2531.339 --> 2540.77
conference again so control the position

2538.869 --> 2551.6800000000003
gatekeeping

2540.77 --> 2551.68
mmm yeah look how how does that work

2553.39 --> 2560.1299999999997
because like everyone has their own set

2557.799 --> 2564.19
of ideas they're unfocused like you have

2560.13 --> 2566.65
discursive donors you have those that

2564.19 --> 2568.7200000000003
are like the ether and like woo gravity

2566.65 --> 2571.2000000000003
use electromagnetism blah blah and there

2568.72 --> 2575.0789999999997
have convictions in that area and they

2571.2 --> 2577.8089999999997
they go out to kind of prove it though

2575.079 --> 2581.079
not very scientifically is that a

2577.809 --> 2584.369
gatekeeper again keeper for what for who

2581.079 --> 2588.069
for progress or is it just a

2584.369 --> 2590.98
misconception a personal endeavor that

2588.069 --> 2594.0389999999998
they want to do within the Flat Earth

2590.98 --> 2596.22
I don't see that as gatekeeper at all at

2594.039 --> 2596.2200000000003
all

2615.73 --> 2618.48
hello

2620.47 --> 2630.4599999999996
all right hey what any dude thanks for

2625.45 --> 2633.7599999999998
joining and the wind is blowing around

2630.46 --> 2641.56
the chair shot tonight and still asking

2633.76 --> 2646.4500000000003
for the curve what is that Martin I got

2641.56 --> 2652.66
the juice yep yeah I was inspired to

2646.45 --> 2655.21
make that yesterday because yeah Martin

2652.66 --> 2658.66
is always on about got some real juice

2655.21 --> 2662.8
this time the Jews like the nectar of

2658.66 --> 2664.6299999999997
knowledge him that started the tartarean

2662.8 --> 2670.2400000000002
thing or just in the bullets of Flat

2664.63 --> 2672.31
Earth kind of I'm not entirely sure but

2670.24 --> 2675.25
he did personally bring it to my

2672.31 --> 2676.65
attention at least that area I still

2675.25 --> 2681.64
don't know what that is

2676.65 --> 2683.14
that's history vodka its history

2681.64 --> 2686.02
what what's really out there has been

2683.14 --> 2689.5299999999997
removed from history all right did they

2686.02 --> 2691.9
have like Easter Tareq hidden truths

2689.53 --> 2694.96
why were they removed from history

2691.9 --> 2699.099
because they were two principles too

2694.96 --> 2700.839
strong to peak civilization and that

2699.099 --> 2703.21
could not coincide with the narrative

2700.839 --> 2708.04
that everything is gradually building up

2703.21 --> 2710.02
to this peak Society yeah well I'll give

2708.04 --> 2714.369
it some credibility just knowing that

2710.02 --> 2717.069
and nothing else but it was there it's

2714.369 --> 2718.7400000000002
been historically regarded is that

2717.069 --> 2722.17
photos of them yeah

2718.74 --> 2724.6299999999997
photographs or just what a system oh

2722.17 --> 2728.53
nice historical records what they were

2724.63 --> 2731.2000000000003
doing how the Empire worked was well the

2728.53 --> 2731.5
arguments against it it and there aren't

2731.2 --> 2734.98
any

2731.5 --> 2736.31
oh it's just being ignored it's just

2734.98 --> 2739.46
like now

2736.31 --> 2741.46
yeah that don't think about it that's

2739.46 --> 2744.05
the argument against it

2741.46 --> 2746.3
there is no respond

2744.05 --> 2747.8300000000004
maybe there are some weirdos out there

2746.3 --> 2750.3500000000004
that are going to say it's all

2747.83 --> 2753.49
propaganda or something all of it

2750.35 --> 2756.5299999999997
so we quite elaborate and detailed

2753.49 --> 2759.77
propaganda in an age where that wouldn't

2756.53 --> 2764.09
make any damn sense to do that turn out

2759.77 --> 2766.22
to all be removed so no it's just for a

2764.09 --> 2768.4700000000003
moved history I definitely believe

2766.22 --> 2773.5099999999998
history's manipulated and told as a

2768.47 --> 2777.1099999999997
story by the authority the author but

2773.51 --> 2779.42
some of us gotta be true well most of it

2777.11 --> 2783.11
is true it's just always the context

2779.42 --> 2786.08
yeah every time something happens in the

2783.11 --> 2789.35
past it happens in a context of what is

2786.08 --> 2791.7799999999997
happening there in that culture in that

2789.35 --> 2794.15
time period with the time struggles that

2791.78 --> 2797.3
were happening there and everything you

2794.15 --> 2799.55
read from that era you have to interpret

2797.3 --> 2801.3500000000004
through that through an understanding of

2799.55 --> 2805.4900000000002
what is actually going on there and not

2801.35 --> 2807.5899999999997
just through modern-day eyes because

2805.49 --> 2811.0099999999998
then you can widely misinterpret and

2807.59 --> 2813.08
extremophiles and put total magic and

2811.01 --> 2816.32
weird [ __ ] spiritual [ __ ] in there if

2813.08 --> 2818.33
you like but yeah that's it's another

2816.32 --> 2821.6000000000004
time it's another mindset another

2818.33 --> 2825.11
culture and I find that personally the

2821.6 --> 2830.0299999999997
most interesting thing about it it's

2825.11 --> 2832.85
culturally alien to us yeah I've been

2830.03 --> 2834.26
listening to Terrence McKenna but you

2832.85 --> 2836.6
just made me think of him because so

2834.26 --> 2839.21
he's his big theory is that the way we

2836.6 --> 2844.25
develop this high consciousness is

2839.21 --> 2847.06
through mushrooms and psychedelics so

2844.25 --> 2850.55
I'll give that some credibility right

2847.06 --> 2853.07
would you I seem to like kind of trigger

2850.55 --> 2855.6200000000003
that kind of thing yeah like the third

2853.07 --> 2857.21
eye awakening over over a long period of

2855.62 --> 2860.2999999999997
time not just like suddenly someone ate

2857.21 --> 2863.48
a mushroom a little bit we became egoic

2860.3 --> 2865.88
or whatever but I don't agree concepts

2863.48 --> 2868.07
were added into our consciousness from

2865.88 --> 2870.07
slowly in mushrooms over a long period

2868.07 --> 2872.9900000000002
of time maybe

2870.07 --> 2877.5800000000004
an extra type of thinking you know I

2872.99 --> 2881.12
pass what a monkey what about what no no

2877.58 --> 2884.5699999999997
absolutely not no this is nothing to do

2881.12 --> 2887.75
with evolution it's okay another factor

2884.57 --> 2890.84
that allows us an extra dimensional

2887.75 --> 2892.94
approach you could say yeah so it was

2890.84 --> 2896.1800000000003
always there it was always there it's

2892.94 --> 2899.4500000000003
just as soon as you start to use the app

2896.18 --> 2904.22
psychedelics then you touch upon that

2899.45 --> 2908.66
field that was always there always yeah

2904.22 --> 2910.8199999999997
it's a natural part of what humans are

2908.66 --> 2912.74
what the theory is you know back when we

2910.82 --> 2914.96
were early early humans and we were

2912.74 --> 2917.62
still living in the jungle like cavemen

2914.96 --> 2920.33
or wherever I don't know the back then

2917.62 --> 2923.18
well that boy his theory is much more

2920.33 --> 2924.14
never caveman [ __ ] well whatever we

2923.18 --> 2926.45
were back then

2924.14 --> 2928.16
he believes mushrooms is what helped us

2926.45 --> 2935.3599999999997
develop the high consciousness we have

2928.16 --> 2939.47
now no didn't it was always there it

2935.36 --> 2943.6400000000003
just makes you touch upon it there is no

2939.47 --> 2945.5299999999997
evolution there was no cavemen humans

2943.64 --> 2948.0699999999997
have always been humans and we've gone

2945.53 --> 2951.77
through Imperial cycles of all kinds

2948.07 --> 2953.84
okay and humans existed in the Atlantean

2951.77 --> 2956.15
age as well do you think our brains

2953.84 --> 2960.4700000000003
developed somewhat though since humans

2956.15 --> 2963.92
started no not oh wow no it's just the

2960.47 --> 2966.47
way information is handled the way

2963.92 --> 2969.23
things are structured yeah force the

2966.47 --> 2970.8799999999997
brain to adapt to that culture to that

2969.23 --> 2975.44
way of thinking that's what it does it

2970.88 --> 2977.03
adapts what it has evolved well I own a

2975.44 --> 2981.44
mine called an adoption O'Brien's

2977.03 --> 2983.7400000000002
adopted right I think it's depressing

2981.44 --> 2987.29
out of cus cuz now we think too much

2983.74 --> 2989.8399999999997
that's that's the culture of now it's

2987.29 --> 2993.2799999999997
the Information Age so yeah information

2989.84 --> 2993.28
is what we're gonna be drowning in

2996.03 --> 3000.53
nice it should wait so your shows

2997.83 --> 3002.5099999999998
finished before starting his shirt no ha

3000.53 --> 3004.73
ha it's a premiere he can do whatever he

3002.51 --> 3006.65
likes oh it's only a premiere right

3004.73 --> 3008.6
there's no life debates anyway I was

3006.65 --> 3011.69
gonna address him from chat if you want

3008.6 --> 3014.06
it but that's just silliness right well

3011.69 --> 3020.09
Nathan can come on the show if he wants

3014.06 --> 3022.85
and get all Nathan E if he likes on you

3020.09 --> 3026.33
this is fine by me or he can stay in

3022.85 --> 3032.8399999999997
check well what else has happened what's

3026.33 --> 3034.22
interesting so yeah I heard you say fish

3032.84 --> 3037.25
oil for depression I've never tried that

3034.22 --> 3039.3199999999997
I've had depression before hmm never

3037.25 --> 3041.69
tried fish oil but I've heard it's

3039.32 --> 3045.29
healthy for other things well it it

3041.69 --> 3047.69
directly feeds the brain goes when you

3045.29 --> 3054.77
are depressed the depression comes from

3047.69 --> 3057.56
a general state it's usually has to do

3054.77 --> 3060.89
with a kind of hormonal imbalance the

3057.56 --> 3064.25
inability to function in a balanced way

3060.89 --> 3066.7999999999997
it has to do with the serotonin levels

3064.25 --> 3071.6
all the pretty complex hormonal

3066.8 --> 3075.3500000000004
interactions and fish oil provides your

3071.6 --> 3078.0499999999997
brain with the direct fuel that it can

3075.35 --> 3083.06
use to fill up all these missing

3078.05 --> 3086.3300000000004
shortages yeah some very directly like

3083.06 --> 3088.13
you can be severely depressed I'm not

3086.33 --> 3089.66
saying this always works especially if

3088.13 --> 3092.03
you do take pharmaceuticals like

3089.66 --> 3094.1299999999997
antidepressants Android [ __ ] then yeah

3092.03 --> 3096.6800000000003
anything can happen but if you just are

3094.13 --> 3099.02
seriously depressed you take fish oil

3096.68 --> 3102.02
I'll tell you is a great likelihood that

3099.02 --> 3105.68
in within a week most of it will

3102.02 --> 3108.65
probably go away there are no sort of a

3105.68 --> 3110.93
real serious impulsive problems and same

3108.65 --> 3113.26
[ __ ] not about side effects from facial

3110.93 --> 3117.3799999999997
daven none whatsoever

3113.26 --> 3119.8100000000004
absolutely none if you take good good

3117.38 --> 3121.9100000000003
stuff look if you take regular cheap as

3119.81 --> 3123.68
fish oil yeah there may be all kinds of

3121.91 --> 3125.5
side effects because there's probably

3123.68 --> 3127.8999999999996
gonna be toxic

3125.5 --> 3130.57
stuff dissolved in it potentially

3127.9 --> 3133.39
pesticides which dissolve in fats and

3130.57 --> 3136.1800000000003
that is what fish oil mostly is or heavy

3133.39 --> 3139.72
metals which can also gather up so you

3136.18 --> 3142.66
gotta take an unpiloted variety of it or

3139.72 --> 3147.3399999999997
no grana Klee produced fish oil and then

3142.66 --> 3149.6499999999996
it really works John Watson's making

3147.34 --> 3151.3900000000003
some big claims in the chart he said UK

3149.65 --> 3153.55
and other nations are sending troops to

3151.39 --> 3155.68
north polar regions to state claims on

3153.55 --> 3157.57
territories absolutely there's more

3155.68 --> 3159.5499999999997
regions that's ridiculous

3157.57 --> 3163.2000000000003
absolutely there's more land which is

3159.55 --> 3165.67
why Flat Earth is being introduced where

3163.2 --> 3168.0699999999997
we're I don't know he's got the inside

3165.67 --> 3174.01
tracks or some big information there oh

3168.07 --> 3176.1090000000004
sure he does he's probably looking at

3174.01 --> 3178.57
different websites than what I like look

3176.109 --> 3181.96
there are regions there there are

3178.57 --> 3184.7200000000003
islands a lot of islands there the claim

3181.96 --> 3187.69
has been taken Norway Russia owns

3184.72 --> 3190.06
merciful maybe the some true for but

3187.69 --> 3193.51
places are still trying to say claim on

3190.06 --> 3197.02
some territory somewhere no no no it's

3193.51 --> 3200.17
all been claimed I think well even with

3197.02 --> 3203.08
the the four islands and the river thing

3200.17 --> 3207.73
I think in retrospect that that is

3203.08 --> 3209.77
actually misleading propaganda right

3207.73 --> 3212.5
because I don't think there is anything

3209.77 --> 3214.99
there anything at all I think are things

3212.5 --> 3218.98
John it might have been something there

3214.99 --> 3222.1299999999997
once but I think that the idea that

3218.98 --> 3223.72
Mount Meru and that big landmass and the

3222.13 --> 3226.42
four rivers is there I think that's

3223.72 --> 3231.8799999999997
actually a misconception egg is rather

3226.42 --> 3234.67
that Antarctica is that I think Mount

3231.88 --> 3236.98
Meru is a metaphor for all you know

3234.67 --> 3240.2200000000003
ascension up mountains like spiritually

3236.98 --> 3244.089
and physically but I think if earth is a

3240.22 --> 3245.68
flat earth puddle then the edge is where

3244.089 --> 3249.22
they would be sending people to claim

3245.68 --> 3251.589
territory or yes that's really already

3249.22 --> 3255.49
happened by the way somewhere on the ice

3251.589 --> 3258.16
no no land look Antarctica is land and

3255.49 --> 3261.0589999999997
there's ice there but it is land and

3258.16 --> 3265.1499999999996
the territory has already been claimed

3261.059 --> 3268.48
scores ago but there are maps off these

3265.15 --> 3269.98
regions at the new circle and if you

3268.48 --> 3272.079
presume that is literally what it is

3269.98 --> 3275.109
that have names on them

3272.079 --> 3278.9500000000003
Rockefeller Plateau for example that's

3275.109 --> 3280.869
there it's already claimed but they've

3278.95 --> 3281.3089999999997
just changed the shape of what the area

3280.869 --> 3284.0190000000002
is

3281.309 --> 3287.8900000000003
on the masses or in heart concern no

3284.019 --> 3291.3999999999996
it's all a projection and that's the

3287.89 --> 3292.779
thing it's a projection and what are

3291.4 --> 3298.089
they trying to suggest with the

3292.779 --> 3299.88
projection see troops are sent under the

3298.089 --> 3302.68
premise of meeting a Russian threat

3299.88 --> 3305.5
right well that [ __ ] is going on

3302.68 --> 3308.279
yeah Russia is trying to pretty much

3305.5 --> 3311.95
gain some kind of dominance over them

3308.279 --> 3313.539
over to see there in that regions and it

3311.95 --> 3317.3999999999996
rights right next to them and yeah

3313.539 --> 3320.9500000000003
there's be encountered in blah blah blah

3317.4 --> 3323.259
Nick swinging contests on a national

3320.95 --> 3327.22
level that's what's happening there's no

3323.259 --> 3330.5190000000002
no territorial claim it's all about

3327.22 --> 3332.5589999999997
strategic positioning all that [ __ ] so

3330.519 --> 3333.8799999999997
even on my model that I believe in the

3332.559 --> 3337.119
global model with the continent at the

3333.88 --> 3340.21
bottom or at the bomb as we look at it

3337.119 --> 3341.65
as we conceptualize it I think there's

3340.21 --> 3343.2400000000002
lots of strange stuff going on in

3341.65 --> 3345.339
Antarctica and it's very mysterious and

3343.24 --> 3347.41
suspicious anyway or even in my belief

3345.339 --> 3349.8089999999997
system I just don't think there's an

3347.41 --> 3354.46
edge I think it's a mysterious place on

3349.809 --> 3359.4700000000003
the bomb and the globe right well I

3354.46 --> 3361.38
think it is a landmass and how deep it

3359.47 --> 3365.2889999999998
goes that's another matter

3361.38 --> 3369.359
like I'd conceived that especially from

3365.289 --> 3371.92
a rectangular looping setup yeah

3369.359 --> 3377.0989999999997
Antarctica could be fast it could in

3371.92 --> 3380.799
actuality be so fast that it its entire

3377.099 --> 3385.0
land mass could be just as big as our

3380.799 --> 3386.619
known earth realm entirely yeah just a

3385.0 --> 3389.71
giant

3386.619 --> 3392.2200000000003
land mass as big as her as everything

3389.71 --> 3395.38
the continents and the sea then we know

3392.22 --> 3397.6299999999997
we don't know look if you go down there

3395.38 --> 3401.589
you might bump into a barrier I don't

3397.63 --> 3404.619
know that's there yeah or yeah it just

3401.589 --> 3407.23
continues on until potentially you end

3404.619 --> 3408.9700000000003
up in a new seat how do you feel about

3407.23 --> 3410.7400000000002
this container argument because this is

3408.97 --> 3415.2099999999996
the bane of my life right now the last

3410.74 --> 3417.8489999999997
few months that there's like 10

3415.21 --> 3420.369
definitions in science that say a gas

3417.849 --> 3421.9300000000003
pressure needs a container right but

3420.369 --> 3423.7000000000003
they're not referring to the whole of

3421.93 --> 3425.859
the planet or atmospheric pressure

3423.7 --> 3427.6299999999997
they're referring to what we do with gas

3425.859 --> 3430.63
pressure kinds of gas basketballs car

3427.63 --> 3434.289
tires vacuum cleaners other other things

3430.63 --> 3436.96
vacuum chambers do you believe those

3434.289 --> 3439.059
definitions and that natural law you

3436.96 --> 3443.44
believe that means there has to be a

3439.059 --> 3445.63
container in the sky nice to know the

3443.44 --> 3449.2000000000003
gas pressure has to be contained

3445.63 --> 3451.69
so there is a clam how a container and

3449.2 --> 3454.049
that can mean a lot of things okay

3451.69 --> 3456.009
that's mean is an infinite open space

3454.049 --> 3458.47
there instantly got my respect for

3456.009 --> 3460.93
saying that can mean lots of things this

3458.47 --> 3463.5389999999998
is no I got from some people right but

3460.93 --> 3467.14
that lots of things is still pretty

3463.539 --> 3469.3590000000004
narrow okay because it cannot be a wide

3467.14 --> 3470.739
open space it doesn't have to be

3469.359 --> 3472.5389999999998
physical are you saying but it has to

3470.739 --> 3474.759
have the same properties as a container

3472.539 --> 3477.2490000000003
how we observe it on earth has to be

3474.759 --> 3480.7
limited that's the right that's the

3477.249 --> 3485.7099999999996
final factor it has to be limited then

3480.7 --> 3488.98
no gaps right cuz if there's a gap then

3485.71 --> 3491.43
it's not a container it's open right so

3488.98 --> 3493.329
you kind of you sound like you're half

3491.43 --> 3495.759
inferring there has to be a sky

3493.329 --> 3497.619
container or you do agree but your

3495.759 --> 3500.799
interpretation of what sky container is

3497.619 --> 3503.1400000000003
is open delimiters

3500.799 --> 3506.44
no I was very straight to the point it

3503.14 --> 3509.049
has to be a limited amount that's what

3506.44 --> 3512.0190000000002
makes it a container and how that

3509.049 --> 3514.66
limitation is enforced that's another

3512.019 --> 3517.75
matter could be a dome

3514.66 --> 3520.66
or a a table on top of us and yeah

3517.75 --> 3523.42
whether the nature it all depends on the

3520.66 --> 3526.87
very nature of this world is this just a

3523.42 --> 3530.6800000000003
literal spatial literal world then yeah

3526.87 --> 3532.96
a disc may seem absolutely never but if

3530.68 --> 3536.1099999999997
there is a looping element a similar

3532.96 --> 3540.52
torii looping element to it then the

3536.11 --> 3545.05
loop the loop of these special confine

3540.52 --> 3546.73
may be the container itself is a limited

3545.05 --> 3550.3900000000003
space and the gas is going to be

3546.73 --> 3554.32
pressing on one side to itself and on

3550.39 --> 3557.08
the other side to itself so the spatial

3554.32 --> 3559.54
confined loop will then function as a

3557.08 --> 3561.34
container although that's not yeah on

3559.54 --> 3564.61
the top there still would have to be

3561.34 --> 3566.83
some kind of limiter how that works I

3564.61 --> 3571.26
have no idea a platform or maybe maybe

3566.83 --> 3571.2599999999998
the very bottom of this world is there

3571.83 --> 3579.73
you're thinking like something solid

3575.52 --> 3582.4
tangible very likely what doesn't

3579.73 --> 3588.22
necessarily have to be it could be some

3582.4 --> 3590.4700000000003
kind of natural occurring force field of

3588.22 --> 3592.8399999999997
some kind but yeah then you get into

3590.47 --> 3595.54
science fiction territories don't even

3592.84 --> 3599.3500000000004
hope or maybe it's just frozen up maybe

3595.54 --> 3601.72
it gets so cold high up so cold that the

3599.35 --> 3607.0899999999997
gas simply turns liquid and then turns

3601.72 --> 3608.3799999999997
solid what's the barrier see when you

3607.09 --> 3610.96
say forcefield I've heard a globe

3608.38 --> 3613.3
actually describe and say gravity can

3610.96 --> 3614.95
act as a force field I said no don't

3613.3 --> 3617.59
call it that don't call it a force field

3614.95 --> 3618.52
and then they say Garrity gravity can

3617.59 --> 3621.52
act as a barrier

3618.52 --> 3624.07
I said no don't call our barrier well

3621.52 --> 3625.69
not know but not the concept of gravity

3624.07 --> 3627.1000000000004
as we know it right now and it is a

3625.69 --> 3631.14
concept you can't actually

3627.1 --> 3634.15
scientifically prove it's there but I've

3631.14 --> 3636.99
speculated we can prove that the devil's

3634.15 --> 3640.9300000000003
advocate speculated for the freakin NASA

3636.99 --> 3642.91
as the craft stubborn that yep what if

3640.93 --> 3644.1499999999996
gravity if you're gonna go the

3642.91 --> 3646.49
Einsteinian route

3644.15 --> 3648.529
relative what if gravity is not

3646.49 --> 3652.1299999999997
straightforward for you you have this

3648.529 --> 3654.5
mass it exerts a gravity field that over

3652.13 --> 3656.6600000000003
distance dies down what if it's not a

3654.5 --> 3659.18
regular thing and it's very long it's

3656.66 --> 3661.16
Soundwave where it has strength points

3659.18 --> 3664.64
it get weaker and then something for

3661.16 --> 3666.47
example if parts like kind of like you

3664.64 --> 3669.71
shut up for a second

3666.47 --> 3672.4399999999996
where it becomes really strong and then

3669.71 --> 3677.75
perhaps at the lower pressure systems

3672.44 --> 3680.809
that super strong point that's which is

3677.75 --> 3682.549
highly speculative could then exert

3680.809 --> 3685.88
enough pressure to keep it all in there

3682.549 --> 3688.609
most of it in there but this is just

3685.88 --> 3690.02
hyper speculation well I don't mind that

3688.609 --> 3692.299
theory because I think nature is

3690.02 --> 3694.369
variable lots of it and saying we know

3692.299 --> 3700.0099999999998
the universal law however I think is

3694.369 --> 3704.27
naive no it's not so I agree it could be

3700.01 --> 3706.76
variable in some ways you don't know you

3704.27 --> 3709.609
can't even prove it is actually there

3706.76 --> 3711.7990000000004
it's completely did you theory it's an

3709.609 --> 3715.46
aberration we prove the effect

3711.799 --> 3717.799
no no you've not well I believe we have

3715.46 --> 3720.7400000000002
oh you're sure I'm sure you believe you

3717.799 --> 3722.359
do but you haven't you haven't proven

3720.74 --> 3724.97
anything scientifically you've only

3722.359 --> 3727.5789999999997
deduced on the widespread amount of

3724.97 --> 3729.529
aberrations but there must be something

3727.579 --> 3731.8390000000004
there because everything points at it

3729.529 --> 3735.17
well it's not well that's a good enough

3731.839 --> 3737.779
come on well it's not good have it's an

3735.17 --> 3741.38
aberration you don't have proof you just

3737.779 --> 3744.5
have widely suggested things out there

3741.38 --> 3748.9100000000003
doesn't mean it's actually their water

3744.5 --> 3752.2
suggested evidence of the effect yeah

3748.91 --> 3754.67
yeah but suggestions are not proof

3752.2 --> 3757.3089999999997
that's what makes it an aberration it's

3754.67 --> 3759.38
just like oh I see a hologram of

3757.309 --> 3761.8390000000004
something Wow

3759.38 --> 3764.059
everything in my senses tells me it is

3761.839 --> 3767.5099999999998
there there's a physical thing there yet

3764.059 --> 3771.3190000000004
if you approach it it's gone well yeah

3767.51 --> 3772.789
you're widely suggested information may

3771.319 --> 3775.38
have pointed you that there's something

3772.789 --> 3777.0890000000004
physically there but it's not

3775.38 --> 3780.15
and the same thing goes for gravity

3777.089 --> 3783.9
there's heavily suggested elements out

3780.15 --> 3786.809
there phenomena that suggest a force is

3783.9 --> 3789.559
equilibrium being doesn't but there's

3786.809 --> 3794.2690000000002
not you can't prove it

3789.559 --> 3797.549
well strongly suggest is enough for me

3794.269 --> 3801.269
good for you what you was your theory

3797.549 --> 3803.13
about the Lupus the rectangular looping

3801.269 --> 3804.8089999999997
thing I don't believe that physically

3803.13 --> 3806.46
but I give it some credit because I

3804.809 --> 3808.1400000000003
think nature and spirituality is a bit

3806.46 --> 3809.849
like looping you know with cycles like

3808.14 --> 3814.799
life and death I think that's kind of

3809.849 --> 3817.4700000000003
like a loop and cultures and our

3814.799 --> 3821.309
everything goes around in loops so you

3817.47 --> 3827.279
know the physical loop isn't past me

3821.309 --> 3833.4300000000003
giving it an idea okay sure

3827.279 --> 3835.5
it's one step if you consider a similar

3833.43 --> 3840.569
torii nature then it's really not that

3835.5 --> 3842.88
difficult and doesn't mean it's all the

3840.569 --> 3846.5389999999998
computer simulation this is all not real

3842.88 --> 3850.259
you're interfacing through you yeah to

3846.539 --> 3852.509
suggest that this is real no cement or

3850.259 --> 3855.69
assimilatory means that the foundation

3852.509 --> 3857.97
of it is built like a simulation that

3855.69 --> 3860.819
doesn't mean it's not real just because

3857.97 --> 3862.98
that creation is similar Tory in nature

3860.819 --> 3864.72
because when you go round a sphere

3862.98 --> 3868.67
that's kind of like a loop right it's

3864.72 --> 3873.45
almost the same theoretically but a

3868.67 --> 3876.329
physical like loop like a pacman it's

3873.45 --> 3879.779
like the flour version I don't know yeah

3876.329 --> 3883.349
except it has no curvature yeah it's the

3879.779 --> 3886.67
earth does not have well we see the

3883.349 --> 3896.9100000000003
effects of coach or a lot on obstruction

3886.67 --> 3898.6800000000003
yes and first code you see straight on

3896.91 --> 3901.81
from there and perspective applies

3898.68 --> 3905.7999999999997
that's how it works

3901.81 --> 3907.84
that's how visuals how sites of optics

3905.8 --> 3910.71
work yeah I agree with that but I don't

3907.84 --> 3915.27
think so there is no curvature

3910.71 --> 3915.27
like the Sun and yeah
