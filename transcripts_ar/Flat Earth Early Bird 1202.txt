118.719 --> 123.119
but then i restarted my computer and it

121.119 --> 126.24

126.24 --> 131.679
i do have to reset the volume so is my

128.879 --> 131.679
volume okay

132.64 --> 137.2
right

134.72 --> 137.2
anyway

137.44 --> 141.16
maybe a bit higher

146.96 --> 151.84
[Music]

149.44 --> 151.84
right

152.4 --> 156.4
yeah it's not as scratchy i don't know

154.16 --> 159.44
what was going on yesterday anyway the

156.4 --> 159.44
weather today is

160.08 --> 162.87900000000002
something else

163.76 --> 166.72
merry christmas

175.44 --> 181.12
so there was a pretty severe snow storm

178.64 --> 183.27999999999997
here last night

181.12 --> 185.59900000000002
was so heavy at times that they actually

183.28 --> 187.44
just had to keep my window completely

185.599 --> 190.07999999999998
closed

187.44 --> 193.84
which normally i don't even do when it's

190.08 --> 196.239
raining but it was snow storming so hard

193.84 --> 199.84
that literally snow was just blowing

196.239 --> 199.84
into my room

200.8 --> 204.08
and yeah it's still there

205.44 --> 209.35999999999999
birds are getting a little

208.159 --> 210.879
weirded out

209.36 --> 213.76000000000002
i guess

210.879 --> 216.959
like yeah that's not the same place

213.76 --> 216.959
this was yesterday

223.519 --> 228.799
i did notice yesterday that i was giving

226.159 --> 231.12
also some bread to the birds

228.799 --> 234.87900000000002
not while it was snowing

231.12 --> 234.879
and they were all super eager

235.84 --> 240.31900000000002
so yeah

237.84 --> 244.0
they they probably felt it coming like

240.319 --> 245.67999999999998
oh we need to stock up on some extra

244.0 --> 248.08
food

245.68 --> 250.15900000000002
reserves in our bellies

248.08 --> 252.56
because there's probably something cold

250.159 --> 253.76
coming

252.56 --> 256.0
i mean

253.76 --> 257.519
the animals usually know these things

256.0 --> 261.919
ahead of time

257.519 --> 261.919
they just know how to read the feelings

262.639 --> 265.199
anyway

266.08 --> 271.68
hello crockett first in chat wrath

269.12 --> 273.84000000000003
geo-shifter mike sidoonich borders boy

271.68 --> 276.479
it's been a while

273.84 --> 278.32
hospital for a couple weeks

276.479 --> 281.68
okay

278.32 --> 284.15999999999997
they block live jets really

281.68 --> 284.16
what the

290.32 --> 294.08
did you know they just released polish

292.32 --> 297.56
gate five

294.08 --> 297.56
five what

300.56 --> 307.32
hello ares 106.

303.6 --> 307.32000000000005
what are you talking about

311.12 --> 316.32
right anyway it is

314.4 --> 320.32
uh oh

316.32 --> 322.56
camera just froze out of nowhere

320.32 --> 324.71999999999997
just just like that did you hear the

322.56 --> 324.72
that

325.28 --> 330.15999999999997
just

327.44 --> 330.16
just like that

332.32 --> 336.199
let's see where's the camera

346.639 --> 348.88
uh

350.8 --> 357.6
you wanted to oh okay

354.08 --> 357.59999999999997
okay oh you got me there

359.6 --> 364.24
it's a potter's gate five

362.319 --> 366.24
they'd have to do baldur's gate four

364.24 --> 369.199
first and i don't think polish gate 3

366.24 --> 369.199
was all that of a

369.44 --> 372.8
explosive success

376.639 --> 382.319
although i haven't really kept track

379.44 --> 382.319
i haven't even like

382.4 --> 387.44
opened it up

385.039 --> 387.44
months

388.319 --> 392.84000000000003
update your usb drivers

395.36 --> 400.08000000000004
okay

396.72 --> 401.36
pretty sure my usb drives are up to date

400.08 --> 402.88
i think it's

401.36 --> 405.88
probably just

402.88 --> 405.88
old

410.56 --> 414.24
anyway yeah good to have you back

412.0 --> 417.44
borders boy and

414.24 --> 417.44
good to see the rest of you

419.039 --> 423.84
bad for fruit trees

420.88 --> 423.84
yeah

424.4 --> 430.08
well i don't know though you know

427.68 --> 432.8
this is april this is not too out of the

430.08 --> 432.8
ordinary

433.44 --> 440.08
for there to be snow in april

437.199 --> 443.12
and i think that like the fruit trees

440.08 --> 446.71999999999997
and the blossoms only really damage

443.12 --> 448.479
if it actually freezes

446.72 --> 450.639
on top of the snow right it's the

448.479 --> 454.24
freezing that does it but the snow is

450.639 --> 454.24
just kind of sitting there it's

454.96 --> 461.039
like it's not super cold it's not like

457.599 --> 461.039
freezing cold outside

463.68 --> 468.56
it's just apparently not warm enough for

466.0 --> 471.28
the snow to melt that quickly but it is

468.56 --> 471.28000000000003
melting though

471.68 --> 475.44
visibly

473.68 --> 478.479
like right now

475.44 --> 480.479
the snow on the bushes there

478.479 --> 483.919
are mostly gone in

480.479 --> 486.0
like was it three four hours ago

483.919 --> 488.15999999999997
they were just completely stuffed with

486.0 --> 490.0
snow

488.16 --> 493.84000000000003
right so it's not going to be that bad

490.0 --> 493.84
for blossoms and all that

494.639 --> 500.16
right as long as it doesn't freeze up

497.44 --> 502.37
on the trees and on the blossom

500.16 --> 505.48
anyway

502.37 --> 505.48
[Music]

508.319 --> 512.72
18 degrees in scotland snow the next day

512.8 --> 516.64
yeah that's a very early april

518.0 --> 523.36
but still guys like yes this might not

520.88 --> 524.08
like happen every year

523.36 --> 526.0
but

524.08 --> 528.8000000000001
over my lifetime i've seen it happen

526.0 --> 530.24
plenty of times around april usually in

528.8 --> 532.959
april

530.24 --> 535.839
this is like snow yesterday was a little

532.959 --> 538.2399999999999
early usually it really hits during

535.839 --> 538.24
april

547.12 --> 550.64
falling off a motorbike at easter during

549.279 --> 553.2
ice and snow

550.64 --> 553.1999999999999
easter

556.08 --> 560.25
what is that

557.44 --> 565.6800000000001
again

560.25 --> 569.73
[Music]

565.68 --> 572.929
and 17th of april right

569.73 --> 572.929
[Music]

584.08 --> 587.9200000000001
this is spring sauce this a few weeks

586.08 --> 590.72
yes well spring break it's like the

587.92 --> 592.959
spring break effect

590.72 --> 592.9590000000001
right

593.279 --> 596.64
that

594.399 --> 597.68
it's an oscillation thing

596.64 --> 599.68
in the

597.68 --> 602.2399999999999
in this yeah in the

599.68 --> 604.399
seasonal patterns

602.24 --> 606.64
so right after the winter phase there's

604.399 --> 607.68
like an unexpected little

606.64 --> 609.92
dip

607.68 --> 612.16
where it gets really warm then it kind

609.92 --> 616.16
of goes back again

612.16 --> 616.16
until the actual spring comes

616.959 --> 622.2399999999999
i thought that was called spring break

618.48 --> 622.24
did my camera just freeze up again

624.48 --> 628.76
didn't even hear a sound this time

640.0 --> 646.519
in the 70s what jeff

643.519 --> 646.519
oh

647.279 --> 651.12
right

648.88 --> 654.12
falling off your motorbike during easter

651.12 --> 654.12
okay

669.92 --> 672.92
anyway

675.839 --> 679.36
how are you guys all doing

677.92 --> 682.4799999999999
are you having this kind of weird

679.36 --> 682.48
weather out there as well

682.64 --> 688.36
with snow

684.48 --> 688.36
i know some of you do

694.399 --> 699.2
any

695.76 --> 702.8389999999999
any reflections on yesterday's show

699.2 --> 702.839
it's quite a ruckus

703.44 --> 708.399
i think i pissed off steamy traveler

706.8 --> 710.7199999999999
well and

708.399 --> 713.04
guns have never owned that was plenty of

710.72 --> 715.2
clear although that it really didn't

713.04 --> 717.4399999999999
make any sense

715.2 --> 719.279
right i did unban him at the last moment

717.44 --> 721.12
i just didn't want him to continue

719.279 --> 724.56
commenting

721.12 --> 724.5600000000001
during that show

726.24 --> 731.2
but was like i'm still not entirely sure

728.959 --> 733.04
was that really me

731.2 --> 736.0790000000001
did i really

733.04 --> 739.76
justify a response like that i did did

736.079 --> 742.56
go typical arwenian

739.76 --> 744.24
like a bit overboard

742.56 --> 747.3599999999999
i think

744.24 --> 747.36
people consider that

748.959 --> 756.2099999999999
it's like an unexpected all-in

752.43 --> 756.2099999999999
[Music]

757.44 --> 761.12
and it

758.399 --> 762.639
pissed people off

761.12 --> 765.519
this time

762.639 --> 766.8
it's kind of weird too because

765.519 --> 769.76
i

766.8 --> 771.76
tend to get quite riled up about

769.76 --> 773.4399999999999
things

771.76 --> 775.4399999999999
regularly

773.44 --> 776.399
not too regularly

775.44 --> 778.32
but

776.399 --> 780.48
people don't seem to have too much of

778.32 --> 782.639
trouble with that but this time

780.48 --> 784.8000000000001
they did

782.639 --> 787.44
and guns even called me a satanist and

784.8 --> 790.24
was really like what he never explained

787.44 --> 790.24
it even how

792.75 --> 797.169
[Music]

797.92 --> 800.88
it's good to shake things up now and

799.519 --> 802.32
then

800.88 --> 804.8
and again yeah

802.32 --> 804.8000000000001
i guess

811.92 --> 817.5999999999999
but also like it it's required because

815.36 --> 819.6800000000001
we're all being shushed to sleep

817.6 --> 823.1990000000001
constantly

819.68 --> 825.3599999999999
in ways or bound to very specific

823.199 --> 826.88
thinking nightmare

825.36 --> 828.48
situations

826.88 --> 832.24
getting obsessed

828.48 --> 832.24
with with [ __ ] up things

835.6 --> 839.0400000000001
i just really like to

840.399 --> 844.32
put my

843.04 --> 846.48
overview

844.32 --> 847.6
of how i treat the situation in the

846.48 --> 851.1990000000001
world and just

847.6 --> 851.1990000000001
basically just put it down

853.44 --> 859.0400000000001
and i really do it to basically break

856.079 --> 862.4799999999999
the spell break the flow

859.04 --> 866.399
of just even the general awareness of

862.48 --> 866.399
like decision making concerning that

867.199 --> 870.079
because i think that a whole bunch of

868.48 --> 872.88
people don't even think that they have a

870.079 --> 872.88
choice really

872.92 --> 877.279
[Music]

874.8 --> 877.279
what the

878.639 --> 882.279
oh my god

886.639 --> 892.399
i'll just keep it like this

888.959 --> 895.81
so i can instantly click it

892.399 --> 898.93
it's like the third time

895.81 --> 898.93
[Music]

900.639 --> 906.839
no not steamy borders boy it was guns

902.8 --> 906.8389999999999
have never owned that said that

916.24 --> 920.72
and

917.519 --> 923.68
in a way i i'm not blaming him too much

920.72 --> 923.6800000000001
i mean it's kind of

923.839 --> 927.7600000000001
for the keeping of order that was like

925.839 --> 929.36
really on the line

927.76 --> 930.3199999999999
here

929.36 --> 933.279
right

930.32 --> 934.9590000000001
unjustified but i mean the guy is very

933.279 --> 936.32
passionate i've seen him in in other

934.959 --> 938.959
chats

936.32 --> 942.24
and he is kind of a bit of he has a bit

938.959 --> 945.199
of a wild streak too it can get quite

942.24 --> 945.199
emotional but

946.56 --> 950.2399999999999
not out of control usually

951.839 --> 958.0
and i kind of like the guy but

954.56 --> 960.4799999999999
i don't know it seems like in the last

958.0 --> 962.88
year or so he's not really liking me

960.48 --> 964.16
anymore for some reason maybe it's

962.88 --> 966.48
because

964.16 --> 969.519
i don't know i don't even know him well

966.48 --> 971.6800000000001
enough i guess maybe it's like about the

969.519 --> 975.04
trinity or something

971.68 --> 977.5999999999999
that i've basically made such a heavy

975.04 --> 979.4399999999999
stand for myself

977.6 --> 982.9200000000001
in the face of

979.44 --> 982.9200000000001
modern christianity

983.36 --> 987.12
because i know there's people out there

984.959 --> 988.399
that really can't

987.12 --> 991.12
handle that

988.399 --> 995.6
like they want to accept that they can't

991.12 --> 998.16
they just their heart just will not

995.6 --> 999.6800000000001
go over that threshold and

998.16 --> 1005.519
i get it

999.68 --> 1005.519
it's super tough the community cohesion

1005.839 --> 1009.839
aspect

1008.24 --> 1012.48
is yeah

1009.839 --> 1013.759
i understand if you like put that on a

1012.48 --> 1016.0
high

1013.759 --> 1018.399
ladder for yourself

1016.0 --> 1020.56
right because yeah if you just start to

1018.399 --> 1022.639
like joke around with that

1020.56 --> 1023.5999999999999
a whole bunch of christians out there do

1022.639 --> 1025.28
get

1023.6 --> 1028.319
just really

1025.28 --> 1028.319
super triggered

1028.48 --> 1033.52
and you don't want that to happen if you

1031.199 --> 1039.0790000000002
associate yeah if you want to be part of

1033.52 --> 1039.079
that specific community cohesion thing

1040.799 --> 1045.679
right but i don't

1042.959 --> 1046.72
not really i mean i really want to in a

1045.679 --> 1049.6000000000001
way

1046.72 --> 1052.72
but i've prioritized

1049.6 --> 1055.12
figuring out what is true because i've

1052.72 --> 1058.48
learned over the course of my life that

1055.12 --> 1058.4799999999998
everything is about

1060.64 --> 1063.8400000000001
like all the information we're presented

1062.799 --> 1064.96
with

1063.84 --> 1067.1999999999998
is

1064.96 --> 1070.24
structured

1067.2 --> 1072.64
purposely in ways

1070.24 --> 1075.36
to make us

1072.64 --> 1079.24
imprison ourselves through our ideas

1075.36 --> 1079.24
that they give us

1081.52 --> 1085.76
and it's in everything everything

1083.36 --> 1087.84
everything everything everything

1085.76 --> 1090.8799999999999
including the bible

1087.84 --> 1092.32
not so much even the bible or rather the

1090.88 --> 1094.48
people that

1092.32 --> 1097.2
teach the bible and how they've been

1094.48 --> 1098.16
taught and where that came from

1097.2 --> 1099.8400000000001
right

1098.16 --> 1101.52
it's the other layer

1099.84 --> 1104.9599999999998
of the whole thing

1101.52 --> 1108.0
just imagine that you'd read the bible

1104.96 --> 1110.08
and never met another person that read

1108.0 --> 1113.12
the bible ever

1110.08 --> 1114.6399999999999
and you completely just you

1113.12 --> 1116.8799999999999
worked it out

1114.64 --> 1121.039
spiritual deep diving trying to puzzle

1116.88 --> 1122.96
it like without any other person

1121.039 --> 1125.039
reflecting their things and what they

1122.96 --> 1126.799
heard about and what they believe about

1125.039 --> 1129.28
it to you

1126.799 --> 1131.84
would you ever come

1129.28 --> 1133.12
to the point where you would be able to

1131.84 --> 1134.3999999999999
integrate

1133.12 --> 1137.9189999999999
seamlessly

1134.4 --> 1140.72
with yourself dug up belief in the bible

1137.919 --> 1142.4
with the people out there

1140.72 --> 1143.6000000000001
there's no way

1142.4 --> 1146.64
because

1143.6 --> 1150.0
it's not the bible it's what people have

1146.64 --> 1151.2
said about it that is actually ruling

1150.0 --> 1154.559
there

1151.2 --> 1158.64
it's the people not the bible

1154.559 --> 1158.6399999999999
and that's something that's really like

1159.679 --> 1164.24
that's a really tough challenge

1162.0 --> 1167.76
psychologically

1164.24 --> 1169.52
to all of christianity all of it

1167.76 --> 1171.52
like you

1169.52 --> 1175.2
are potentially

1171.52 --> 1177.52
part of creating the problem

1175.2 --> 1179.8400000000001
that's actually keeping the real power

1177.52 --> 1180.8799999999999
of christianity down

1179.84 --> 1183.36
right

1180.88 --> 1184.24
the devil's making you do it

1183.36 --> 1185.84
christ

1184.24 --> 1187.919
predicted that that sort of thing

1185.84 --> 1188.9599999999998
happens

1187.919 --> 1191.76
right

1188.96 --> 1194.24
if you're gonna get on a tighter

1191.76 --> 1196.24
writer path closer to god everything's

1194.24 --> 1197.84
gonna close in on you

1196.24 --> 1200.32
from your own

1197.84 --> 1200.32
side

1201.52 --> 1204.52
anyway

1208.24 --> 1211.1200000000001
hey adam price

1213.12 --> 1217.559
okay my camera seems to do fine

1220.3 --> 1223.3999999999999
[Music]

1226.799 --> 1231.2
right anyway that was all just me trying

1229.28 --> 1232.799
to figure out why he was like it could

1231.2 --> 1236.559
be that he's just

1232.799 --> 1236.559
kind of in a shitty mood because

1237.36 --> 1242.9599999999998
painful things might have happened or

1238.96 --> 1242.96
something right but there's plenty

1243.44 --> 1248.799
friends and [ __ ] that like get vaccine

1246.32 --> 1250.72
damaged or whatever you know this enough

1248.799 --> 1252.8799999999999
in certain

1250.72 --> 1254.72
swings of the pendulum

1252.88 --> 1256.4
where you just

1254.72 --> 1260.919
you're just looking for something to

1256.4 --> 1260.919
smack so maybe it was that

1262.799 --> 1267.52
but it was still

1264.32 --> 1267.52
disappointing to me

1272.0 --> 1276.24
seen randy's no i don't

1274.0 --> 1279.12
dude i don't even know what his channel

1276.24 --> 1279.1200000000001
is adam price

1287.679 --> 1291.3200000000002
hmm anyways

1298.0 --> 1301.0
wow

1304.64 --> 1310.44
man all that light reflecting of the

1306.72 --> 1310.44
snow is so bright

1313.76 --> 1316.91
[Music]

1347.039 --> 1349.919
right anyway

1352.799 --> 1355.36
what's that

1358.64 --> 1363.679
don't think it's real oh dear

1362.32 --> 1364.559
that sounds

1363.679 --> 1366.88
bad

1364.559 --> 1366.8799999999999
pretty

1372.84 --> 1376.1589999999999
full oh

1375.28 --> 1377.6
yeah

1376.159 --> 1378.64
no

1377.6 --> 1380.9599999999998
god

1378.64 --> 1384.76
look at those eyes

1380.96 --> 1384.76
holy [ __ ] dude

1389.84 --> 1395.1999999999998
he's starting to look more like roof as

1392.4 --> 1395.2
time passes

1396.48 --> 1400.08
but yeah oh

1398.24 --> 1402.08
earth is flat yeah the of course he's an

1400.08 --> 1404.6399999999999
april's fool's joke that guy's never

1402.08 --> 1405.6789999999999
coming back you understand

1404.64 --> 1409.2
you

1405.679 --> 1410.24
literally shouldn't even want ranty to

1409.2 --> 1412.64
come back

1410.24 --> 1414.799
we don't want him anymore

1412.64 --> 1417.8400000000001
yeah none of us do

1414.799 --> 1419.679
he's gross

1417.84 --> 1421.4399999999998
he's gross

1419.679 --> 1424.0
he's a liar

1421.44 --> 1425.6000000000001
he admittedly like to plays games with

1424.0 --> 1426.72
people's feelings

1425.6 --> 1428.6399999999999
you just

1426.72 --> 1430.48
overtly

1428.64 --> 1431.5200000000002
we don't want him

1430.48 --> 1433.679
yeah

1431.52 --> 1435.52
we don't need

1433.679 --> 1438.799
ranty

1435.52 --> 1439.6
on the flat earth side we don't need you

1438.799 --> 1441.36
right

1439.6 --> 1444.24
i mean i don't i think at this point not

1441.36 --> 1446.32
even bob wants him

1444.24 --> 1449.64
although maybe i'm wrong about i doesn't

1446.32 --> 1449.6399999999999
really matter

1466.0 --> 1470.64
to rile up flirt yeah well that's what

1467.76 --> 1470.64
he likes to do

1471.679 --> 1477.159
he's dude he's just another anti-flat

1474.159 --> 1477.159
earther

1488.72 --> 1494.769
so

1491.7 --> 1494.769
[Music]

1504.159 --> 1509.919
it was it an act well was it convincing

1506.96 --> 1509.919
in the slightest

1510.4 --> 1514.6000000000001
or was it just stumbling

1514.72 --> 1517.76
kind of nervous

1520.72 --> 1525.4
i don't know i just shouldn't even be

1522.4 --> 1525.4
asking

1554.84 --> 1560.6399999999999
oh

1556.559 --> 1560.6399999999999
oh i missed a little video from jimbo

1560.799 --> 1566.12
check that out

1562.72 --> 1566.1200000000001
later on

1576.08 --> 1580.48
oh yeah i figured out why om benjamin

1578.4 --> 1582.64
didn't have a stream

1580.48 --> 1586.08
apparently he was really sick

1582.64 --> 1589.279
at the flu the entire family did one at

1586.08 --> 1589.279
a time interesting

1595.919 --> 1600.5590000000002
i always like his like he's also going

1599.039 --> 1601.6
sort of

1600.559 --> 1604.08
well

1601.6 --> 1606.32
fully terrain theory

1604.08 --> 1607.76
maybe even in direction of german new

1606.32 --> 1610.799
medicine

1607.76 --> 1614.08
or he would be ready for that

1610.799 --> 1616.6399999999999
it is quite next to it

1614.08 --> 1616.6399999999999
it fits

1617.84 --> 1623.3999999999999
but i i like his way of thinking with

1620.4 --> 1623.4
that

1632.72 --> 1638.0
the flu how dare you yeah well he

1634.96 --> 1639.919
doesn't even he says it and i agree

1638.0 --> 1643.2
it's not even an infection it has

1639.919 --> 1644.5590000000002
nothing to do with that it's not a

1643.2 --> 1646.3990000000001
virus or

1644.559 --> 1648.399
anything

1646.399 --> 1652.559
coming from the outside and ruining

1648.399 --> 1652.559
things it's your body that's doing that

1653.36 --> 1658.24
because you need it

1655.44 --> 1659.039
because of build up toxins

1658.24 --> 1661.679
and

1659.039 --> 1663.6
your body is a wants a purge right and

1661.679 --> 1667.039
it's he even explained that for a moment

1663.6 --> 1670.7199999999998
it communicated just a lot of detail

1667.039 --> 1673.039
just through the subtlety of the inside

1670.72 --> 1675.44
now my empath just when it goes off

1673.039 --> 1678.32
sometimes my empaths empathic senses

1675.44 --> 1681.039
really go off at times when owen is

1678.32 --> 1681.039
talking about

1681.12 --> 1687.1999999999998
such things

1682.96 --> 1687.2
just feel so much detail in there

1688.399 --> 1692.799
that yeah

1690.24 --> 1696.32
if you see somebody else sick your body

1692.799 --> 1697.12
may literally decide like hey i want

1696.32 --> 1698.0
that

1697.12 --> 1699.36
right

1698.0 --> 1701.6
it's like

1699.36 --> 1703.36
yeah your consciousness doesn't want to

1701.6 --> 1705.1999999999998
get sick

1703.36 --> 1707.4399999999998
because then you'd lose a grip on what

1705.2 --> 1709.6000000000001
you were doing or what you were planning

1707.44 --> 1712.24
to do or wanted to do

1709.6 --> 1713.76
but your body is like a separate like

1712.24 --> 1716.0
technically your body doesn't give a

1713.76 --> 1716.0
[ __ ]

1716.24 --> 1718.64
live your body

1717.919 --> 1721.279
and

1718.64 --> 1722.96
using your senses too

1721.279 --> 1725.679
subconscious

1722.96 --> 1728.88
sees somebody else being sick

1725.679 --> 1730.799
then it could be like yeah i want that

1728.88 --> 1732.72
almost like a little kid i want the

1730.799 --> 1736.24
candy too

1732.72 --> 1736.24
and then you just get sick

1737.679 --> 1743.3600000000001
but there is like this

1740.48 --> 1746.32
spiritual maneuvering room

1743.36 --> 1749.039
owen also explained that how

1746.32 --> 1751.52
everybody got sick in very specific

1749.039 --> 1753.039
phases like first the kids

1751.52 --> 1755.84
then mom

1753.039 --> 1758.1589999999999
then owen

1755.84 --> 1759.84
one after another and that it really

1758.159 --> 1762.48
worked out like that and that's

1759.84 --> 1764.62
fascinating to me

1762.48 --> 1766.559
that's like

1764.62 --> 1769.36
[Music]

1766.559 --> 1772.32
sort of a subconscious control

1769.36 --> 1774.9599999999998
over how it's going to happen

1772.32 --> 1774.96
amazing

1778.0 --> 1781.0
right

1781.36 --> 1786.559
now me as a lonely solitary hermit

1785.6 --> 1789.6789999999999
guy

1786.559 --> 1792.08
i don't really have a lot of people

1789.679 --> 1794.72
around me to compare that with

1792.08 --> 1797.1999999999998
because i'm isolated

1794.72 --> 1799.679
but even like memories from when i was

1797.2 --> 1802.0800000000002
still back with my parents and all that

1799.679 --> 1804.72
and my brother there

1802.08 --> 1807.1999999999998
there was it was there

1804.72 --> 1809.679
unfortunately there was another variable

1807.2 --> 1814.72
in those situations that is that i was

1809.679 --> 1814.72
always trying to step out of everything

1815.44 --> 1819.76
yeah almost like subconsciously

1818.08 --> 1821.84
anti-social

1819.76 --> 1824.1589999999999
so i also

1821.84 --> 1826.0
avoided that

1824.159 --> 1828.7990000000002
and there were times where everybody got

1826.0 --> 1831.6
sick and i didn't get sick

1828.799 --> 1831.6
just at all

1832.08 --> 1837.84
and then sometimes i would get sick and

1834.08 --> 1837.84
really bad and then nobody else would

1839.2 --> 1845.2
but i think it's because of the factor

1841.279 --> 1848.159
where i have effectively isolated myself

1845.2 --> 1851.8400000000001
like on a spiritual level

1848.159 --> 1853.1200000000001
kept myself separate

1851.84 --> 1855.76
anyway

1853.12 --> 1858.08
it's so a bit vague now at this point

1855.76 --> 1858.08
maybe

1859.84 --> 1866.1589999999999
but he doesn't necessarily want but need

1862.159 --> 1866.159
yeah but needing is wanting isn't it

1877.2 --> 1881.44
right it's like a need to go to sleep

1883.36 --> 1890.36
oh if you need to go to sleep you're

1886.159 --> 1890.3600000000001
gonna long for sleep

1899.44 --> 1902.3600000000001
all right well yeah okay fine singing

1901.36 --> 1905.279
star wars if you're gonna

1902.36 --> 1908.7199999999998
compartmentalize it

1905.279 --> 1909.84
between like the conscious wanting

1908.72 --> 1912.159
and the

1909.84 --> 1915.12
subconscious needing sure

1912.159 --> 1917.7600000000002
i i sometimes just like to address

1915.12 --> 1919.36
subconscious elements like if it's its

1917.76 --> 1921.6
own

1919.36 --> 1923.9189999999999
entity

1921.6 --> 1926.48
it to me it kind of is

1923.919 --> 1926.48
in a way

1928.48 --> 1933.64
i guess everybody has their own personal

1930.64 --> 1933.64
approach

1935.36 --> 1938.36
okay

1938.54 --> 1941.809
[Music]

1944.63 --> 1948.8290000000002
[Music]

1958.24 --> 1962.6
great i gotta kill song here

1964.24 --> 1967.24
hmm

1988.32 --> 1991.32
hmm

1995.039 --> 2000.1589999999999
all right

1997.2 --> 2002.88
i understand seeking star wars

2000.159 --> 2005.8400000000001
i function differently

2002.88 --> 2005.8400000000001
i don't really

2007.6 --> 2012.6
keep my will and wants that separate

2016.19 --> 2019.4
[Music]

2026.32 --> 2031.36
because if i really need it to go

2029.12 --> 2033.9189999999999
then i would just go

2031.36 --> 2037.039
even if i don't want to

2033.919 --> 2039.519
that's how i choose

2037.039 --> 2041.279
unless i wouldn't actually need to

2039.519 --> 2044.76
because i could just sit through it and

2041.279 --> 2044.76
ignore it

2046.64 --> 2051.359
and but then i didn't actually really

2048.879 --> 2052.879
need to right the the necessity comes

2051.359 --> 2054.72
from

2052.879 --> 2057.44
actual

2054.72 --> 2058.7999999999997
through time logical

2057.44 --> 2061.839
conclusion

2058.8 --> 2061.8390000000004
to me

2072.13 --> 2075.3
[Music]

2082.399 --> 2085.399
hmm

2112.72 --> 2117.3689999999997
anyway

2114.3 --> 2117.369
[Music]

2118.16 --> 2122.48
he was back

2120.56 --> 2124.31
owen that's where this conversation

2122.48 --> 2127.389
started with

2124.31 --> 2127.389
[Music]

2149.359 --> 2154.4
have i ever been in a no waters boy

2155.68 --> 2159.839
or at least not that i can't remember

2160.32 --> 2166.0
i mean in the dark world plenty of times

2162.96 --> 2168.56
yeah that's weird thing to say

2166.0 --> 2170.88
can't actually pinpoint like in the

2168.56 --> 2173.359
physical reality where where i would

2170.88 --> 2175.119
have done that

2173.359 --> 2177.2799999999997
i've known other people that have done

2175.119 --> 2177.28
it

2181.76 --> 2190.8
access the subconscious what

2186.4 --> 2190.8
would it be a way to access what

2194.88 --> 2200.2000000000003
what do you mean

2197.2 --> 2200.2
access

2202.079 --> 2205.599
you mean you don't have access

2206.72 --> 2210.8799999999997
you have no

2207.92 --> 2213.6800000000003
no control over your subconscious

2210.88 --> 2217.359
no inquiry that's weird

2213.68 --> 2218.8799999999997
my subconscious is an open line to me

2217.359 --> 2220.56
it's like another

2218.88 --> 2223.599
it's like a phone line

2220.56 --> 2223.599
to another place

2223.92 --> 2229.92
i don't need a deprivation tank anything

2228.72 --> 2232.48
like it's

2229.92 --> 2232.48
i'm there

2233.92 --> 2239.2000000000003
the only points where i'm not there

2236.96 --> 2241.599
is when i'm just really distracted or

2239.2 --> 2244.0
like feel kind of sick

2241.599 --> 2246.2400000000002
and then i can't interfere i can't

2244.0 --> 2248.56
actually lay the connection but if i am

2246.24 --> 2251.68
okay

2248.56 --> 2255.68
i am fully connected

2251.68 --> 2255.68
it's how i'm able to do what i do

2255.76 --> 2258.079
hmm

2268.72 --> 2273.1189999999997
noisy emf environment

2271.04 --> 2275.7599999999998
if you go into a dark cave you want to

2273.119 --> 2275.76
hallucinate

2276.72 --> 2279.1189999999997
maybe

2281.119 --> 2285.92
it depends on the cave

2284.32 --> 2287.44
stone also

2285.92 --> 2290.0
does things

2287.44 --> 2293.079
i've been like in caves and on rocks and

2290.0 --> 2293.079
all that

2298.4 --> 2304.1600000000003
you might at first have to get used to

2301.119 --> 2304.1600000000003
basically the void

2307.2 --> 2310.2
but

2313.44 --> 2316.0
i don't know

2316.64 --> 2323.1189999999997
unless you're like

2319.52 --> 2325.2
like radiating things out from yourself

2323.119 --> 2326.88
which by the way typically happens more

2325.2 --> 2327.68
with people

2326.88 --> 2330.48
in

2327.68 --> 2334.24
like tense city environments they're

2330.48 --> 2335.359
just constantly shedding off

2334.24 --> 2336.56
well

2335.359 --> 2338.7999999999997
things they

2336.56 --> 2343.44
need to get out of their system

2338.8 --> 2345.6800000000003
but if you're then suddenly in a cave

2343.44 --> 2348.4
and it's all silence yeah you might

2345.68 --> 2351.04
still be auto shedding but that might

2348.4 --> 2352.8
actually then start to reflect back to

2351.04 --> 2356.88
you

2352.8 --> 2359.28
off the rocks sounds a bit weird right

2356.88 --> 2361.44
i've experienced that

2359.28 --> 2364.6400000000003
if there's a certain switch

2361.44 --> 2367.44
and if you get used to it though

2364.64 --> 2369.5989999999997
then you just start to stop

2367.44 --> 2373.119
doing that

2369.599 --> 2376.079
behaving in a modus

2373.119 --> 2377.92
like in a very crowded city that's very

2376.079 --> 2379.92
noisy

2377.92 --> 2382.48
because

2379.92 --> 2384.88
people like switch modes they don't even

2382.48 --> 2386.88
realize it a lot of the time

2384.88 --> 2388.8
you just act differently depending on

2386.88 --> 2391.04
the environment and what you're gonna do

2388.8 --> 2391.04
there

2391.359 --> 2395.359
and if you're used to like really noisy

2394.32 --> 2397.28
and

2395.359 --> 2399.44
grabby crowds

2397.28 --> 2402.1600000000003
because that's what people do

2399.44 --> 2404.0
you're going to be like shedding

2402.16 --> 2406.56
extra things

2404.0 --> 2408.88
feeling wise

2406.56 --> 2411.44
radiating it out because

2408.88 --> 2412.96
it's gonna reflect off everything anyway

2411.44 --> 2416.16
so it's like

2412.96 --> 2417.599
acting out without people picking it up

2416.16 --> 2421.04
right

2417.599 --> 2421.04
get a bit of stress off

2421.52 --> 2426.16
but if you're really used that or you

2423.359 --> 2428.64
grow up in that exclusively

2426.16 --> 2431.2799999999997
then a person like that

2428.64 --> 2433.1189999999997
might become really unnerved if they're

2431.28 --> 2434.8
in

2433.119 --> 2436.48
closed yeah

2434.8 --> 2439.76
silent places

2436.48 --> 2441.76
that are really silent and like

2439.76 --> 2443.28
don't have a lot of visuals to distract

2441.76 --> 2445.0400000000004
you etc

2443.28 --> 2446.7200000000003
they might get really unnerved from that

2445.04 --> 2448.88
because they're just used to that

2446.72 --> 2450.72
specific motives where they can always

2448.88 --> 2453.839
shed

2450.72 --> 2453.839
their feelings

2454.56 --> 2459.04
do that

2456.64 --> 2462.2799999999997
i don't know i hope this makes sense to

2459.04 --> 2462.2799999999997
you guys

2494.24 --> 2499.1189999999997
meld the two okay borders boy

2497.92 --> 2500.8
i don't know

2499.119 --> 2503.119
if

2500.8 --> 2504.6400000000003
yeah

2503.119 --> 2509.319
i

2504.64 --> 2509.319
i think i'm effectively doing that

2512.16 --> 2517.839
i mean i'm very it's there

2515.76 --> 2523.079
it's like a phone to me and i use it

2517.839 --> 2523.0789999999997
regularly and i'm learning more and more

2524.56 --> 2530.0
but male like to say meld is kind of a

2527.76 --> 2533.0400000000004
weird thing to say because it's like two

2530.0 --> 2535.359
completely different things

2533.04 --> 2537.119
i mean conscious is very different from

2535.359 --> 2539.44
the subconscious

2537.119 --> 2542.88
the entire field

2539.44 --> 2544.7200000000003
that these states operate in is very

2542.88 --> 2547.119
different

2544.72 --> 2550.8799999999997
i don't see how you can meld that you

2547.119 --> 2554.0
could seamlessly connect them

2550.88 --> 2556.7200000000003
to work perfectly smooth

2554.0 --> 2559.2
and like gain a conscious grip on

2556.72 --> 2561.04
subconscious effects right

2559.2 --> 2563.2
well that is effectively what i have

2561.04 --> 2565.2
been doing in ways

2563.2 --> 2567.2
exclusively

2565.2 --> 2569.52
so does that mean that i'm an ascended

2567.2 --> 2572.0
master

2569.52 --> 2573.7599999999998
and how do you practice for that

2572.0 --> 2576.16
did i pract is that what i have been

2573.76 --> 2576.1600000000003
doing

2577.28 --> 2582.4
i mean i'm kind of obsessed with

2580.079 --> 2584.079
all the psychology and skills and the

2582.4 --> 2587.119
analytics of

2584.079 --> 2589.8390000000004
the workings of the subconscious etc etc

2587.119 --> 2592.319
dream world are yeah

2589.839 --> 2595.2
is that what an ascended master does i

2592.319 --> 2595.2
have no idea

2597.68 --> 2601.48
it's what i've been doing

2604.27 --> 2607.389
[Music]

2625.04 --> 2627.2799999999997
hmm

2631.44 --> 2634.56
what i have found in my personal

2633.44 --> 2638.319
experience

2634.56 --> 2640.56
because i've met some remarkable people

2638.319 --> 2643.37
i have

2640.56 --> 2646.5299999999997
or even indirectly

2643.37 --> 2646.5299999999997
[Music]

2648.88 --> 2651.359
that all

2652.319 --> 2656.0
real what we associate with ascended

2654.8 --> 2658.7200000000003
power

2656.0 --> 2661.52
intuitively

2658.72 --> 2663.839
it's really all about

2661.52 --> 2663.839
confidence

2664.8 --> 2670.0
and just acceptance of

2667.44 --> 2674.0
the power you really have and the

2670.0 --> 2676.88
consequences it really has

2674.0 --> 2679.52
right that's kind of like the only real

2676.88 --> 2679.52
key to it

2680.16 --> 2686.0
if you're just confident like yeah i can

2683.44 --> 2690.68
do incredible things

2686.0 --> 2690.68
i will go through this go through that

2691.04 --> 2696.72
and just like

2693.04 --> 2698.8
incorporate the magic you have within

2696.72 --> 2700.56
what you're gonna plan

2698.8 --> 2704.44
right that's like integrating

2700.56 --> 2704.44
subconscious things

2704.64 --> 2709.52
that you deal with

2706.56 --> 2712.52
with your conscious

2709.52 --> 2712.52
life

2729.599 --> 2733.839
oh with descended wow you me you mean

2731.92 --> 2737.52
like prophets

2733.839 --> 2737.52
is that an ascended man okay

2738.72 --> 2741.7599999999998
right makes sense

2742.64 --> 2748.16
then okay and that if it

2745.68 --> 2752.48
to that then i do under more understand

2748.16 --> 2752.48
what you mean with melding the two

2754.8 --> 2758.319
but with these individuals it seemed

2757.119 --> 2761.52
much more

2758.319 --> 2764.96
dramatic it's like they literally just

2761.52 --> 2764.96
broke open the gate

2771.04 --> 2776.8
right it's more than just

2773.359 --> 2779.68
learn like what jesus did

2776.8 --> 2783.1600000000003
is more than just learning

2779.68 --> 2783.16
how you work

2798.48 --> 2803.0
hmm

2800.0 --> 2803.0
okay

2803.2 --> 2806.3999999999996
seth books

2806.56 --> 2813.4
how to serve consciousness levels what

2810.4 --> 2813.4
okay

2832.319 --> 2838.0
the break open dark

2834.56 --> 2838.0
good point borders boy

2841.839 --> 2845.119
good point

2843.44 --> 2847.44
it might have been

2845.119 --> 2850.559
seriously

2847.44 --> 2853.359
in a way it's what i wanted

2850.559 --> 2853.3590000000004
it's just that

2856.72 --> 2860.72
i don't

2858.559 --> 2863.599
know

2860.72 --> 2864.7999999999997
or experience like i actually succeeded

2863.599 --> 2867.6800000000003
i

2864.8 --> 2871.04
i figured things out

2867.68 --> 2875.2
but did i like equal to that i don't

2871.04 --> 2875.2
know maybe it's just not time yet

2877.2 --> 2881.2799999999997
there's so many

2879.04 --> 2884.72
relatively basic obstacles that i'm

2881.28 --> 2887.3590000000004
still just not overcoming

2884.72 --> 2890.359
that an ascended master would absolutely

2887.359 --> 2890.359
do

2903.2 --> 2908.0789999999997
right but i know it could be worse at

2905.839 --> 2908.0789999999997
least

2908.8 --> 2915.3590000000004
i'm trying to kind of slowly

2911.839 --> 2917.92
steadily build towards it though

2915.359 --> 2922.64
because i really do want to overcome my

2917.92 --> 2925.599
sin obstacles i really really do

2922.64 --> 2925.5989999999997
it's just that

2926.079 --> 2930.319
yeah

2927.44 --> 2933.68
the other side it's been kind of brutal

2930.319 --> 2936.16
like my ego really

2933.68 --> 2940.44
doesn't like

2936.16 --> 2940.44
letting go of things you see

2943.84 --> 2948.48
[Music]

2947.2 --> 2951.9199999999996
and habits

2948.48 --> 2954.48
because every habit i have is like is

2951.92 --> 2957.6800000000003
what's even left

2954.48 --> 2960.16
of experiences i picked my habits even

2957.68 --> 2962.5589999999997
relatively careful

2960.16 --> 2965.04
right that i always have habits even

2962.559 --> 2968.4
though they're flawed or not optimal

2965.04 --> 2971.44
that i'd still get something out of it

2968.4 --> 2974.88
that they actually do bring me joy

2971.44 --> 2974.88
even just temporarily

2975.76 --> 2979.3590000000004
but because of that

2977.599 --> 2980.8
mechanism

2979.359 --> 2983.359
i'm also

2980.8 --> 2985.52
therefore very defensive

2983.359 --> 2987.92
for anything that tries to take that

2985.52 --> 2987.92
away

2988.88 --> 2992.92
even with the best intentions

3002.559 --> 3006.0
hello seth wilderberg

3009.5 --> 3013.68
[Music]

3010.96 --> 3016.2400000000002
anyway i had a really great conversation

3013.68 --> 3019.04
yesterday with

3016.24 --> 3021.4399999999996
my roommate like really

3019.04 --> 3021.44
awesome

3023.28 --> 3027.3190000000004
i kind of had like a

3028.48 --> 3034.2400000000002
i call that

3030.72 --> 3034.24
genie out of the bottle moment

3034.8 --> 3038.1600000000003
because i had

3036.24 --> 3040.24
like i had to communicate where and but

3038.16 --> 3043.44
i noticed like i'm getting closed off

3040.24 --> 3046.64
intense and that's not good

3043.44 --> 3046.64
so i kind of just like

3047.04 --> 3053.44
open up my heart for a second

3050.24 --> 3055.7599999999998
and just try to lay down like

3053.44 --> 3058.079
ah things are so hectic out there and

3055.76 --> 3061.3590000000004
psychological warfare is getting worse

3058.079 --> 3061.3590000000004
and all this double think

3061.599 --> 3066.319
and she was like

3063.04 --> 3068.96
really with me

3066.319 --> 3072.48
when i did that so it almost felt like

3068.96 --> 3074.8
we were like in her own little dimension

3072.48 --> 3074.8
and

3075.119 --> 3080.52
i just love that woman i really love

3077.28 --> 3080.52
that girl

3082.319 --> 3087.44
i asked her if i could hug her but she

3085.68 --> 3090.3999999999996
got a bit

3087.44 --> 3092.7200000000003
deflective when i said that so i guess

3090.4 --> 3094.96
that's not

3092.72 --> 3097.04
she's not that comfortable with me just

3094.96 --> 3099.599
yet

3097.04 --> 3102.079
but i was just so happy to be able to

3099.599 --> 3104.88
express myself kind of in a

3102.079 --> 3106.079
yeah unlimited way

3104.88 --> 3107.76
and not

3106.079 --> 3110.4
face somebody that

3107.76 --> 3111.92
that visibly is like i have to pull on

3110.4 --> 3113.119
the shield because you're too much for

3111.92 --> 3115.6800000000003
me

3113.119 --> 3118.8
but she was actually really like giving

3115.68 --> 3122.839
feedback with intensity that's just oh

3118.8 --> 3122.8390000000004
made me just want to kiss her

3124.24 --> 3129.04
i so appreciate when women are good at

3126.8 --> 3129.04
that

3132.4 --> 3139.839
my ex was only moderate at it

3135.2 --> 3139.839
but good enough to survive on

3143.81 --> 3146.909
[Music]

3155.76 --> 3163.0
um okay buddhist borders boy interesting

3159.28 --> 3163.0
a flatter stage

3176.48 --> 3179.2
awesome

3177.44 --> 3180.7200000000003
indeed dude

3179.2 --> 3182.96
i was

3180.72 --> 3182.9599999999996
yeah

3183.44 --> 3187.92
he was basically like one step away from

3185.839 --> 3190.48
just

3187.92 --> 3190.48
romance

3193.599 --> 3196.88
but

3195.359 --> 3199.92
not yeah

3196.88 --> 3199.92
unfortunately not

3200.8 --> 3203.8390000000004
i'm just

3201.839 --> 3206.16
kind of excited to know that that's

3203.839 --> 3209.599
still possible that i haven't like

3206.16 --> 3214.24
spiritually mutated so far

3209.599 --> 3216.319
into the unnatural by accident that

3214.24 --> 3219.359
that i can't even connect on that

3216.319 --> 3221.52
department anymore i i can so i

3219.359 --> 3225.359
apparently am not even that unnatural

3221.52 --> 3226.96
and that's a great relief by itself

3225.359 --> 3229.359
because there's still somebody that

3226.96 --> 3233.16
could just like seemingly seamlessly

3229.359 --> 3233.16
connect in the moment

3242.8 --> 3246.8
hmm dreamer has awakened yeah yeah

3247.44 --> 3254.96
it's funny because i was like kind of

3250.079 --> 3254.96
overtly classified a dreamer as a kid

3260.96 --> 3266.2400000000002
and in a way i still am

3263.359 --> 3266.24
i managed to

3266.319 --> 3271.52
not throw those tool sets into the

3269.119 --> 3272.8
garbage can because of some humiliation

3271.52 --> 3275.68
or some

3272.8 --> 3277.6800000000003
dwelling that cost me more than i wanted

3275.68 --> 3280.5589999999997
to admit

3277.68 --> 3280.5589999999997
and i retained it

3281.2 --> 3284.0
and

3282.4 --> 3286.559
i forged

3284.0 --> 3288.799
a grasp

3286.559 --> 3291.8390000000004
on heliocentrism with it

3288.799 --> 3294.799
and on how it's made how people are

3291.839 --> 3297.2799999999997
actually making that like to me it's

3294.799 --> 3300.079
really sometimes like it

3297.28 --> 3302.559
like i'm a game master again

3300.079 --> 3305.44
playing dungeons and dragons

3302.559 --> 3307.119
and guiding players except

3305.44 --> 3309.599
these players

3307.119 --> 3311.839
are virtual

3309.599 --> 3314.559
they're actual people out there i don't

3311.839 --> 3317.52
even know who they are i can't

3314.559 --> 3320.4
literally see them but i can figure out

3317.52 --> 3323.359
what would be roughly realistic as to

3320.4 --> 3326.64
what they would be doing in the moment

3323.359 --> 3327.5989999999997
and then really visualize that

3326.64 --> 3329.359
and

3327.599 --> 3332.88
being a game master in dungeons and

3329.359 --> 3334.72
dragons has really assisted me in

3332.88 --> 3337.359
the ability

3334.72 --> 3337.359
to do that

3337.839 --> 3343.4
and i'm using it

3339.599 --> 3343.4
i'm using it a lot

3358.96 --> 3363.839
the seth books what were you talking to

3361.76 --> 3363.8390000000004
no

3373.44 --> 3377.799
okay borders boy yeah that's interesting

3380.48 --> 3385.68
right well there's one way to do that in

3382.559 --> 3385.6800000000003
a way i do that too

3386.64 --> 3391.68
except i do it in my mind

3389.119 --> 3394.0
like i'm just never forgetting who i was

3391.68 --> 3397.2
throughout time like i'm not allowing

3394.0 --> 3397.2
myself to forget that

3398.079 --> 3404.0
even though it was very repulsive and

3401.2 --> 3406.72
counter opposite to things that i stand

3404.0 --> 3406.72
for right now

really appreciate that that's great

tired of your little chillum what

3495.359 --> 3497.92
what's that

3500.48 --> 3505.28
is that like a just a pipe or something

3506.72 --> 3509.72
hmm

3527.2 --> 3530.7599999999998
very major

3531.2 --> 3534.799
what what's major

3535.2 --> 3538.3999999999996
you mean mature

3540.48 --> 3543.88
seth wildenberg

3567.119 --> 3570.119
hmm

3572.01 --> 3575.099
[Music]

3577.36 --> 3581.2090000000003
[Music]

3581.359 --> 3585.24
so most flat earthers

3586.319 --> 3592.16
uh yeah i don't know though

3588.4 --> 3595.44
to say that children equals open mind

3592.16 --> 3597.359
is kind of a bit of a reification

3595.44 --> 3599.04
understand what you mean

3597.359 --> 3600.64
we associate children with

3599.04 --> 3601.68
open-mindedness

3600.64 --> 3605.44
like this

3601.68 --> 3605.44
archetypal to do that

3607.28 --> 3611.92
but yeah not all flat earthers are

3609.44 --> 3614.7200000000003
necessarily open-minded though it's just

3611.92 --> 3617.52
that the ones that we get to see

3614.72 --> 3619.68
the ones that come out with it that are

3617.52 --> 3623.52
in hanging in the chats that are doing

3619.68 --> 3625.7599999999998
shows about it etc right yeah

3623.52 --> 3625.7599999999998
they

3626.24 --> 3631.68
are very open-minded about it there's

3628.64 --> 3633.5989999999997
still plenty of people out there

3631.68 --> 3635.839
that kind of know about flat earth in

3633.599 --> 3637.3590000000004
the globe things or just sci-fi and

3635.839 --> 3640.88
nonsense

3637.359 --> 3640.88
they just don't really care

3641.119 --> 3645.599
they just like oh okay

3643.119 --> 3648.2400000000002
so it's just a story fine

3645.599 --> 3650.0
they don't they're not really

3648.24 --> 3652.3999999999996
curious

3650.0 --> 3654.839
why and how and how can we change this

3652.4 --> 3657.359
and no we have to do something

3654.839 --> 3660.0
now they might just know it and be like

3657.359 --> 3662.5589999999997
yeah whatever

3660.0 --> 3664.96
i don't care

3662.559 --> 3666.3190000000004
but yeah the the ones that we interact

3664.96 --> 3668.079
with

3666.319 --> 3670.799
they're the ones that

3668.079 --> 3672.799
are much more engaging that's why we get

3670.799 --> 3675.359
to see them we don't get to see the ones

3672.799 --> 3675.359
that don't

3675.76 --> 3680.3190000000004
so we then associate it with the

3677.68 --> 3682.16
engagers we think that is all the flat

3680.319 --> 3685.839
earthers but no that's the ones that are

3682.16 --> 3685.839
just very forward with it

3700.24 --> 3702.5589999999997
what

3703.599 --> 3707.599
what are you

3704.64 --> 3709.5989999999997
what do you mean borders boy

3707.599 --> 3712.559
staggering how much we have to learn

3709.599 --> 3716.92
from pre-birth

3712.559 --> 3716.92
until we die what do you mean

3732.16 --> 3736.0
it's not oh you think

3734.96 --> 3738.319
okay

3736.0 --> 3738.319
well

3738.4 --> 3744.079
it's it's really hard to tell in the end

3742.0 --> 3746.0
because of the rose color darkly that we

3744.079 --> 3749.039
all look through no matter how

3746.0 --> 3749.039
insightful we are

3749.44 --> 3752.88
but

3750.559 --> 3755.8390000000004
i've reasoned out that

3752.88 --> 3756.96
all of that could be specifically

3755.839 --> 3758.799
for

3756.96 --> 3762.88
this experience

3758.799 --> 3762.88
because there's actual logical

3764.0 --> 3769.039
yeah reasoning

3767.2 --> 3771.52
that would actually indicate that

3769.039 --> 3774.079
everything else the whole throughout

3771.52 --> 3777.68
time thing pre-birth afterlife

3774.079 --> 3780.0
is all a crystallized effect

3777.68 --> 3782.799
that only exists

3780.0 --> 3785.52
because of the physical manifestation

3782.799 --> 3788.24
which it is entangled with

3785.52 --> 3788.24
you understand

3790.079 --> 3792.6400000000003
maybe not

3794.4 --> 3800.4
but i see often like the earthly

3797.68 --> 3803.359
manifestation god's creation

3800.4 --> 3805.28
is actually the real seed

3803.359 --> 3808.88
that carries

3805.28 --> 3808.88
all the spiritual realms

3809.44 --> 3813.92
that they exist in the way that we

3811.52 --> 3816.24
experience them because of the material

3813.92 --> 3816.2400000000002
realm

3818.319 --> 3823.44
right because the spiritual is

3822.0 --> 3825.44
fluid

3823.44 --> 3827.68
where is it going to anchor in

3825.44 --> 3830.0
well the material realm seems to be the

3827.68 --> 3830.0
only

3830.72 --> 3837.1189999999997
stable consistent thing

3834.48 --> 3840.079
and therefore it is the standard even

3837.119 --> 3844.0
for spiritual reflection like all my

3840.079 --> 3847.2000000000003
dark world experiences were all

3844.0 --> 3848.319
one way or another reflections

3847.2 --> 3850.72
or

3848.319 --> 3851.52
simulacrum

3850.72 --> 3854.319
of

3851.52 --> 3856.64
physical experiences

3854.319 --> 3860.0
right our very

3856.64 --> 3862.799
conscious design of what we do

3860.0 --> 3865.28
and what we think about is based on

3862.799 --> 3867.68
reflections of the material realm every

3865.28 --> 3868.7200000000003
single thing about it every single thing

3867.68 --> 3871.68
ever

3868.72 --> 3874.48
you understand so you might then draw

3871.68 --> 3876.64
the conclusion that

3874.48 --> 3878.72
maybe it all only exists because the

3876.64 --> 3881.72
material realm and our experience here

3878.72 --> 3881.72
exists

3894.61 --> 3897.7490000000003
[Music]

3898.24 --> 3903.0389999999998
all right i don't see this earthly life

3901.359 --> 3905.0389999999998
as a

3903.039 --> 3907.039
just another level

3905.039 --> 3911.039
i don't see it like that

3907.039 --> 3914.6400000000003
i see it as the level it's the scent is

3911.039 --> 3917.039
pandemonium it's the central thing

3914.64 --> 3919.44
in which everything else rests that's

3917.039 --> 3920.7990000000004
also why i get so

3919.44 --> 3923.92
fanatical

3920.799 --> 3925.92
when it comes to like spiritual

3923.92 --> 3928.48
war

3925.92 --> 3931.92
because i trust

3928.48 --> 3933.52
that my refined senses and journey

3931.92 --> 3935.44
and the conclusions that came from that

3933.52 --> 3937.599
were not incorrect

3935.44 --> 3939.92
i don't see this as just another train

3937.599 --> 3939.92
stop

3940.559 --> 3944.96
this is the

3942.16 --> 3944.96
train stop

3945.44 --> 3952.4
without this train stop

3947.839 --> 3952.4
there might not be any railroad

[Music]

3960.72 --> 3965.52
that's why i'm taking yeah it's very

3963.039 --> 3968.7990000000004
serious and also

3965.52 --> 3968.799
perceived failure

3969.039 --> 3975.6800000000003
really weighs heavy on my soul

3973.039 --> 3978.6400000000003
so i'm very punishing towards myself at

3975.68 --> 3980.48
times because of that

3978.64 --> 3983.0389999999998
because i take it very serious i always

3980.48 --> 3985.28
have even as a kid i take everything

3983.039 --> 3987.2000000000003
extremely serious and people will be

3985.28 --> 3990.4
like oh why are you

3987.2 --> 3993.839
taking it so serious

3990.4 --> 3993.839
just enjoy the moment

3996.24 --> 4001.359
well yeah then i'd be like okay well

3999.44 --> 4004.7200000000003
i already know where you're going with

4001.359 --> 4006.5589999999997
that frequency with that level of

4004.72 --> 4008.3999999999996
engagement

4006.559 --> 4010.0
for your for your consciousness i

4008.4 --> 4012.2400000000002
already know where that's going to end

4010.0 --> 4013.359
up you're going to be sorry about that

4012.24 --> 4015.0389999999998
and then you're going to blame

4013.359 --> 4017.2799999999997
everything else

4015.039 --> 4019.5200000000004
once you're sorry about that

4017.28 --> 4021.44
till it's over and then

4019.52 --> 4024.0
you'll just think like that again that's

4021.44 --> 4024.0
what happens

4025.359 --> 4028.799
i'm just

4026.559 --> 4032.8390000000004
taking everything really serious that

4028.799 --> 4036.48
also makes the punishment effectively

4032.839 --> 4038.24
higher things hurt more

4036.48 --> 4039.839
but

4038.24 --> 4040.8799999999997
this is

4039.839 --> 4043.2799999999997
the

4040.88 --> 4043.28
place

4043.68 --> 4046.16
it is

4046.24 --> 4051.9199999999996
everything else is crystallized

4049.839 --> 4054.24
of our subconscious of our conscious

4051.92 --> 4056.64
everything is crystallized around this

4054.24 --> 4056.64
place

4058.559 --> 4061.3590000000004
can you see it

4061.52 --> 4066.96
where does the fractal where do the

4063.599 --> 4069.52
fractal patterns come from

4066.96 --> 4070.559
of our our memories or sites what are

4069.52 --> 4074.319
they

4070.559 --> 4076.6400000000003
it's all reflections of physical

4074.319 --> 4079.119
physical things

4076.64 --> 4080.96
and life including it's also physical

4079.119 --> 4084.6400000000003
life

4080.96 --> 4084.64
it's all reflections of that

4085.44 --> 4090.799
all our conceptions are based on

4088.88 --> 4093.28
physical substance

4090.799 --> 4093.28
all of it

4093.44 --> 4097.52
even when we try to in visualize

4096.0 --> 4100.48
esoterics

4097.52 --> 4103.4400000000005
typically people do it in their minds

4100.48 --> 4104.639999999999
based on physical things

4103.44 --> 4105.919999999999
like even

4104.64 --> 4108.08
ghosts

4105.92 --> 4110.799
are just like mist

4108.08 --> 4112.96
or a veil right what are those things

4110.799 --> 4116.2789999999995
physical things

4112.96 --> 4120.08
so in the end even the esoteric even the

4116.279 --> 4121.4400000000005
non-material we represent in some way

4120.08 --> 4124.719
with an anchor

4121.44 --> 4126.0
of a physical thing every

4124.719 --> 4127.04
single

4126.0 --> 4129.92
thought

4127.04 --> 4132.92
in existence

4129.92 --> 4132.92
yeah

4140.319 --> 4145.6
because our thoughts are shaped by the

4142.4 --> 4148.92
reflections of physical things

4145.6 --> 4148.92
all of it

4164.0 --> 4169.04
yeah and when i explain this by the way

4166.0 --> 4171.92
it made really makes me feel think about

4169.04 --> 4173.5199999999995
the scene in interstellar

4171.92 --> 4176.08
in the end

4173.52 --> 4179.759
is it the uh

4176.08 --> 4183.44
like the fifth dimension thing

4179.759 --> 4184.64
everything our spirit

4183.44 --> 4185.44
does

4184.64 --> 4187.759
is

4185.44 --> 4190.3189999999995
based on reflections of physical

4187.759 --> 4194.159
interaction through our sensories

4190.319 --> 4194.159000000001
everything everything we think

4194.719 --> 4201.36
it's all based off some reflection of

4198.32 --> 4202.96
the physical world all of it

4201.36 --> 4205.839999999999
be honest

4202.96 --> 4208.8
it is it is the very fabric

4205.84 --> 4212.08
of our spirit

4208.8 --> 4217.84
the way it's woven is all based on

4212.08 --> 4217.84
reflections of physical things all of it

4232.48 --> 4237.759999999999
huh

4234.159 --> 4237.759999999999
okay elise g that's interesting

4238.08 --> 4243.36
so we're having a you having a

4240.159 --> 4245.599999999999
synchronicity moment then

4243.36 --> 4248.599999999999
the hundred what is d hundred i have no

4245.6 --> 4248.6
idea

4258.239 --> 4262.718999999999
yeah talking about which

4260.239 --> 4266.4
netflix

4262.719 --> 4266.4
i finished up watching the uh

4267.6 --> 4273.76
lost in space series

4270.239 --> 4277.5199999999995
they did round it out but it still

4273.76 --> 4278.56
left open room for potentially more

4277.52 --> 4280.8
but it

4278.56 --> 4282.159000000001
the way they rounded it out yeah it does

4280.8 --> 4283.37
make me think that they're not going to

4282.159 --> 4285.04
continue in the series

4283.37 --> 4286.5599999999995
[Music]

4285.04 --> 4288.88
but it's been good

4286.56 --> 4291.360000000001
very enjoyable

4288.88 --> 4292.2390000000005
and i i dug into something new which is

4291.36 --> 4294.799999999999
just

4292.239 --> 4297.12
really hilarious to me

4294.8 --> 4298.84
i just it popped by and it was like what

4297.12 --> 4304.08
the hell is

4298.84 --> 4306.32
this is really funny and interesting

4304.08 --> 4306.32
it's

4306.719 --> 4311.679
it's like a

4308.88 --> 4311.679
an anime

4313.28 --> 4317.5199999999995
but also

4314.56 --> 4319.52
with some real footage sep is like

4317.52 --> 4321.76
compartment and it's all about

4319.52 --> 4323.76
bath houses

4321.76 --> 4326.88
and that's weird a bit because there's

4323.76 --> 4329.4400000000005
like constantly naked men

4326.88 --> 4332.719
everywhere but it's non-sexual you never

4329.44 --> 4333.5199999999995
get to see a single penis not a single

4332.719 --> 4336.64
one

4333.52 --> 4338.400000000001
it's very japanese but it's also about

4336.64 --> 4341.76
the romans

4338.4 --> 4343.759999999999
and this architect guy

4341.76 --> 4347.1990000000005
in rome who wanted to be an architect of

4343.76 --> 4349.679
bath houses and he is such a fanatic

4347.199 --> 4352.96
he is like so

4349.679 --> 4356.4800000000005
into bath houses it's like whoa dude

4352.96 --> 4359.04
this guy's like tripping balls on his

4356.48 --> 4360.48
obsession with bath houses

4359.04 --> 4363.76
and it's

4360.48 --> 4366.5599999999995
it's exhilarating it's so funny and it's

4363.76 --> 4369.04
interesting because yeah there's a lot

4366.56 --> 4369.04
of like

4369.28 --> 4374.88
fascinating things

4371.52 --> 4374.88
in that series it's like

4375.28 --> 4380.48
oh did somebody send me a paypal

4377.52 --> 4380.4800000000005
oh thank you for that

4380.96 --> 4385.12
thank you dank i really really

4382.8 --> 4386.8
appreciate that i absolutely need to

4385.12 --> 4389.36
support

4386.8 --> 4392.08
thank you very much uh

4389.36 --> 4393.28
what's the name again

4392.08 --> 4395.679
because

4393.28 --> 4398.48
if if you can stomach

4395.679 --> 4401.92
like anime a bit

4398.48 --> 4404.639999999999
and yeah on top of it that this is like

4401.92 --> 4407.1990000000005
absolutely non-sexual

4404.64 --> 4407.1990000000005
it really is

4407.76 --> 4410.719
right

4408.56 --> 4413.719
yeah it's called

4410.719 --> 4413.719
tereme

4418.4 --> 4423.759999999999
i don't know how to pronounce that

4421.44 --> 4425.12
and yeah it's about a bathhouse

4423.76 --> 4427.92
architect

4425.12 --> 4429.28
from ancient rome who for some reason

4427.92 --> 4430.88
like

4429.28 --> 4433.28
gets these

4430.88 --> 4435.84
psychedelic trips

4433.28 --> 4438.719
from his own pineal gland

4435.84 --> 4440.400000000001
and then like goes through time

4438.719 --> 4443.04
to future japan

4440.4 --> 4445.12
and then learns of the modern day bath

4443.04 --> 4446.56
housing techniques and is like really

4445.12 --> 4448.88
like whoa

4446.56 --> 4450.2390000000005
[ __ ] what is this and then he tries to

4448.88 --> 4452.4800000000005
adapt that

4450.239 --> 4456.08
in rome and he becomes kind of

4452.48 --> 4456.08
successful with that too but it's

4457.76 --> 4465.04
it's extremely entertaining to me

4462.159 --> 4467.199
and hilarious it's like really

4465.04 --> 4468.8
fascinating and hilarious at the same

4467.199 --> 4472.719
time so yeah

4468.8 --> 4472.719
it's a weird little japanese

4472.88 --> 4477.28
series on netflix that i caught on if

4475.44 --> 4479.759999999999
you want to know everything about bath

4477.28 --> 4479.759999999999
houses

4480.88 --> 4485.6
if you don't mind seeing a lot of naked

4483.6 --> 4487.84
men without seeing genitals a single

4485.6 --> 4487.84
time

4487.92 --> 4492.32
but yeah that's kind of weird about it

4489.92 --> 4495.12
but it's it's like more of like yeah

4492.32 --> 4497.5199999999995
just nudist like

4495.12 --> 4500.08
i have weird background [ __ ] because my

4497.52 --> 4500.080000000001
mom was

4500.159 --> 4504.32
my mom was about baths we had a swimming

4502.64 --> 4505.92
pool a heated swimming pool in the back

4504.32 --> 4508.88
of her garden

4505.92 --> 4511.1990000000005
and my mom yeah so i'm kind of used to i

4508.88 --> 4513.04
like i wasn't like oh

no i'm like no

4513.04 --> 4516.08
it's non-sexual

4517.12 --> 4522.64
but on top of that it's really hilarious

4522.96 --> 4525.84
and interesting

4528.96 --> 4532.159
anyway yeah

4531.199 --> 4536.239
that's

4532.159 --> 4539.04
very fitting there godzilla 37

4536.239 --> 4542.179999999999
thank you for the super chat with the

4539.04 --> 4545.57
japanese dog

4542.18 --> 4545.570000000001
[Laughter]

4546.56 --> 4551.320000000001
tara no faith no it's not terra novae

4554.96 --> 4557.6
wait let me

4561.12 --> 4564.32
let me just try to write

4564.84 --> 4569.32
it tear me

4577.54 --> 4581.149
[Music]

4589.43 --> 4598.56
[Music]

4595.47 --> 4598.56
[Applause]

4606.48 --> 4613.32
now

4608.96 --> 4613.32
there may not terra

4628.32 --> 4633.28
dude if it was that

4630.32 --> 4634.88
yeah duh then i'd probably even bring it

4633.28 --> 4637.199
up at the flat earth debates and all

4634.88 --> 4640.400000000001
that no it has nothing to do with that

4637.199 --> 4642.0
this is purely culture and engineering

4640.4 --> 4643.12
that's what this

4642.0 --> 4645.12
weird

4643.12 --> 4647.199
little series hilarious weird little

4645.12 --> 4649.28
series is about

4647.199 --> 4652.08
it's about culture and it's about

4649.28 --> 4657.159
engineering it's very serious actually

4652.08 --> 4657.159
but it's also hilarious within that

4664.4 --> 4668.719
right i guess it's about spas yeah i

4666.48 --> 4668.718999999999
guess

4671.12 --> 4675.44
but seriously like

4672.96 --> 4678.2390000000005
it's pretty much everything you would

4675.44 --> 4680.96
have ever imagined

4678.239 --> 4681.678999999999
that could associate with bath or a spa

4680.96 --> 4686.0
or

4681.679 --> 4688.32
anything ever is probably in that series

4686.0 --> 4690.88
every example you would have ever heard

4688.32 --> 4693.04
of in your lifetime is probably in that

4690.88 --> 4694.719
series it's super fanatical in its

4693.04 --> 4697.6
research

4694.719 --> 4699.92
truly it is

4697.6 --> 4702.4800000000005
like it was literally i think that the

4699.92 --> 4704.56
series might have been written

4702.48 --> 4707.5199999999995
by

4704.56 --> 4710.159000000001
like this lady that is like

4707.52 --> 4712.320000000001
is like that she is super fanatical

4710.159 --> 4714.4
about bath houses and she has bath

4712.32 --> 4715.759999999999
houses and she creates bath houses and

4714.4 --> 4716.879999999999
she does study

4715.76 --> 4718.96
like

4716.88 --> 4722.32
because that's like the second or that's

4718.96 --> 4727.04
like the last part of every show is like

4722.32 --> 4729.759999999999
her basically explaining in real world

4727.04 --> 4732.32
how she came up with the ideas for that

4729.76 --> 4734.2390000000005
episode where she went and then she

4732.32 --> 4736.239
actually just on you get to see the

4734.239 --> 4739.839999999999
actual places that were that inspired

4736.239 --> 4739.839999999999
her to make that episode it's

4739.92 --> 4747.32
it's very japanese

4742.08 --> 4747.32
but it's awesome i really like it so far

4748.08 --> 4751.92
yes that was the name of the series

4755.92 --> 4763.32
it's on netflix

4757.76 --> 4763.320000000001
i bumped into it just yesterday evening

4768.159 --> 4773.44
but you gotta realize

4771.44 --> 4776.5599999999995
like the cartoon part

4773.44 --> 4777.759999999999
it's mostly you're looking at well naked

4776.56 --> 4779.52
people

4777.76 --> 4781.1990000000005
a lot

4779.52 --> 4782.080000000001
that are like

4781.199 --> 4784.879999999999
not

4782.08 --> 4786.5599999999995
it's not yeah it's very uh drawn

4784.88 --> 4789.96
honestly

4786.56 --> 4789.96
with human

4790.159 --> 4795.44
it's very human

4792.8 --> 4798.679
i don't know it's human it's hilarious i

4795.44 --> 4798.678999999999
don't know

4812.719 --> 4817.52
i thought it was

4814.4 --> 4818.48
very very entertaining it made me smile

4817.52 --> 4820.8
a lot

4818.48 --> 4822.879999999999
and that's something that's very tough

4820.8 --> 4826.12
to achieve sometimes

4822.88 --> 4826.12
for me

4830.67 --> 4833.84
[Music]

4840.8 --> 4843.8
hey

4848.56 --> 4851.84
i'm just looking for the imdb there you

4851.12 --> 4854.32
go

4851.84 --> 4856.88
oh it's brand new by the way

4854.32 --> 4856.88
apparently

4857.44 --> 4861.44
right

4858.84 --> 4865.6
so here you go

4861.44 --> 4865.599999999999

4885.3 --> 4888.869000000001
[Music]

4897.92 --> 4903.4
like even the trailer is just freaking

4900.4 --> 4903.4
hilarious

4914.08 --> 4917.21
[Music]

4919.88 --> 4923.06
[Music]

4937.36 --> 4944.12
oh just watching that

4939.36 --> 4944.12
makes me smile again it's so hilarious

4944.719 --> 4947.719
ugh

4966.639 --> 4969.639
hmm

4979.36 --> 4983.759999999999
yeah me too godzilla

4981.679 --> 4986.0
that i don't have a bath right here it's

4983.76 --> 4988.639
been

4986.0 --> 4988.639
a decade

4988.88 --> 4992.400000000001
and i really do like baths

4993.28 --> 4998.8
well no wait i did have one actually

4996.8 --> 5002.320000000001
and i was kind of sick

4998.8 --> 5005.1990000000005
went to like old neighbor lady

5002.32 --> 5005.199
who has a bath

5011.6 --> 5017.52
but seriously like if you watch this

5013.92 --> 5020.719
series it'll bring you like

5017.52 --> 5024.4800000000005
it's really serious

5020.719 --> 5024.4800000000005
it's something else it's like

5024.639 --> 5030.400000000001
really it's like

5027.199 --> 5033.36
fanatical like these

5030.4 --> 5036.638999999999
the characters in there are like

5033.36 --> 5039.44
bath houses are our survival it's our

5036.639 --> 5042.32
culture it means everything if we can't

5039.44 --> 5044.96
have bath houses and relax afterward we

5042.32 --> 5047.199
would lose wars

5044.96 --> 5047.199
like

5051.12 --> 5054.4
it was hilarious

5055.12 --> 5061.44
but like it did have actually a point

5057.84 --> 5062.8
it's just so funny to actually see it

5061.44 --> 5065.12
and to

5062.8 --> 5067.04
to have you yeah to think about that

5065.12 --> 5070.5599999999995
anyway

5067.04 --> 5073.36
hello paul cuddle good to see you

5070.56 --> 5073.360000000001
yeah you're late

5079.6 --> 5082.729
[Music]

5083.6 --> 5086.8
oh borders boy look

5086.96 --> 5092.2390000000005
watch the series

5089.28 --> 5093.36
and you will know how to use

5092.239 --> 5094.959999999999
the bath

5093.36 --> 5096.639
properly

5094.96 --> 5100.719
oh wait

5096.639 --> 5100.719
now it's shifted from japanese to

5101.6 --> 5104.719
slavic

5102.719 --> 5106.56
uh

5104.719 --> 5108.639
no really

5106.56 --> 5112.080000000001
i think that this series probably

5108.639 --> 5113.92
contains every little refined piece of

5112.08 --> 5115.6
knowledge that concerns

5113.92 --> 5117.28
bathing

5115.6 --> 5118.159000000001
spas

5117.28 --> 5121.599999999999
bath

5118.159 --> 5124.5599999999995
bath engineering that has ever existed

5121.6 --> 5127.52
it might literally all be in that one

5124.56 --> 5129.679
series it's not even a joke when i say

5127.52 --> 5129.679
that

5130.719 --> 5136.88
but i haven't watched through it all but

5133.199 --> 5138.08
so far it's like really impressive

5136.88 --> 5140.719
i'm like

5138.08 --> 5143.44
three episodes in

5140.719 --> 5145.04
and just the amount of information that

5143.44 --> 5146.32
you're presented with is pretty

5145.04 --> 5148.88
staggering

5146.32 --> 5152.44
and fascinating and you're like damn it

5148.88 --> 5152.4400000000005
i wanna do that

5156.639 --> 5160.159000000001
yeah paul connell yeah it's it's more

5158.639 --> 5163.61
wrenches

5160.159 --> 5166.8099999999995
than wrenchless now

5163.61 --> 5166.8099999999995
[Music]

5184.48 --> 5187.759999999999
ah you were looking for enemy oh flatter

5186.88 --> 5191.76
sage

5187.76 --> 5191.76
you're gonna love this series

5194.96 --> 5197.84
i know you will

5199.92 --> 5203.1990000000005
like

5200.719 --> 5205.12
seriously this series is is really

5203.199 --> 5208.4
probably a serious

5205.12 --> 5209.5199999999995
even a spell a construction

5208.4 --> 5212.159
spell

5209.52 --> 5214.159000000001
because i i know

5212.159 --> 5216.0
that as this thing is spreading around

5214.159 --> 5218.32
there's gonna be a whole bunch of people

5216.0 --> 5220.719
that are gonna be like violently

5218.32 --> 5224.239
inspired

5220.719 --> 5226.88
to like do something like that

5224.239 --> 5228.638999999999
and to get like a special type of bath

5226.88 --> 5231.679
right or an outdoor

5228.639 --> 5233.92
it's going to do that this series is

5231.679 --> 5236.4
guaranteed to do that it's almost like

5233.92 --> 5238.159
an industrial promotion

5236.4 --> 5240.719
film but it's not it's beyond that

5238.159 --> 5244.638999999999
because it's so cultural

5240.719 --> 5244.639
and historical it's amazing

5245.88 --> 5249.079
[Music]

5250.84 --> 5256.4800000000005
anyway build bath houses then win the

5253.6 --> 5256.4800000000005
war that's right

5258.56 --> 5264.4400000000005
get a bath or die no not that far

5267.04 --> 5271.679
it's just that they basically say if

5268.96 --> 5273.36
they don't have bath houses

5271.679 --> 5277.36
and they don't can't wind down then

5273.36 --> 5281.48
they'd all become demoralized and sick

5277.36 --> 5281.48
and then they'd lose the war

5281.679 --> 5286.76
and

5282.719 --> 5286.76
might be something to that

5313.52 --> 5316.52
uh

5322.159 --> 5326.239
hmm

5324.0 --> 5327.679
right anyway just wanted to share that

5326.239 --> 5331.12
for a bit because

5327.679 --> 5334.76
it it really just made me laugh and kind

5331.12 --> 5334.76
of feel happy

5336.96 --> 5340.639
technically like i i'm looking forward

5339.6 --> 5342.88
to

5340.639 --> 5346.4400000000005
continue watching that

5342.88 --> 5346.4400000000005
later in the evening

5353.199 --> 5356.799999999999
fairly common in europe yeah yeah

5361.12 --> 5365.679
oh there's bath houses and

5363.52 --> 5368.2390000000005
fall swords like spread around over the

5365.679 --> 5368.2390000000005
netherlands

5369.7 --> 5372.75
[Music]

5377.12 --> 5382.08
oh that sounds amazing seeing star wars

5379.679 --> 5383.07
yeah this series is all about that kind

5382.08 --> 5386.18
of thing

5383.07 --> 5386.179999999999
[Music]

5386.239 --> 5391.4
at least

5387.28 --> 5391.4
most of it seems like that

5396.96 --> 5399.96
so

5413.199 --> 5416.919999999999
right borders boy

5436.48 --> 5443.799999999999
oh really what is why i didn't know that

5438.96 --> 5443.8
dude you seem to know a lot about it

5445.0 --> 5449.489
[Music]

5471.76 --> 5475.320000000001
anyway yes

5476.239 --> 5479.839999999999
i just wanted to share that with you

5478.239 --> 5481.599999999999
guys and

5479.84 --> 5484.56
like i haven't watched the whole thing

5481.6 --> 5487.04
through just yet so i'm not

5484.56 --> 5489.84
like fully saturated with like

5487.04 --> 5491.92
interesting little details just yet but

5489.84 --> 5495.360000000001
it might be

5491.92 --> 5495.36
over the course of next week

5496.639 --> 5501.04
or i'll just kind of like slip into the

5498.56 --> 5501.84
background but yeah i shared it check it

5501.04 --> 5504.4
out

5501.84 --> 5506.2390000000005
watch that if you're in into like

5504.4 --> 5508.96
anime type

5506.239 --> 5508.959999999999
japanese

5509.28 --> 5515.44
series and it's really funny

5512.639 --> 5517.4400000000005
it's not sexual which i really really

5515.44 --> 5520.719
liked about this series is that it's

5517.44 --> 5522.799999999999
like completely not sexual

5520.719 --> 5526.4
and that they really made an effort to

5522.8 --> 5528.719
like make things funny but not sexual

5526.4 --> 5532.04
i really appreciated that

5528.719 --> 5532.04
so far

5538.4 --> 5542.4
yeah and be

5539.84 --> 5544.56
you know why

5542.4 --> 5546.879999999999
why i like that so much because it's

5544.56 --> 5548.400000000001
such a contrast

5546.88 --> 5550.639
with the [ __ ]

5548.4 --> 5552.96
that's going down

5550.639 --> 5556.8
out there right now

5552.96 --> 5556.8
where it's exactly the opposite

5556.88 --> 5561.28
everybody's just like

5558.719 --> 5566.159
sexualize everything and uh

5561.28 --> 5567.5199999999995
sexualized even children and so gross ah

5566.159 --> 5570.48
then to watch

5567.52 --> 5575.4800000000005
is like a hilarious series that's very

5570.48 --> 5575.48
serious and inspired and cultural and

5576.32 --> 5580.159
where

5577.84 --> 5583.12
yeah you get to basically see a whole

5580.159 --> 5584.239
bunch of naked people and none of it is

5583.12 --> 5587.76
sexual

5584.239 --> 5590.638999999999
you did they don't talk about it

5587.76 --> 5592.8
it's all not everything they do is just

5590.639 --> 5595.28
like how things like that would happen

5592.8 --> 5598.320000000001
in the real world with people

5595.28 --> 5601.199
it's amazing it's such a

5598.32 --> 5602.799999999999
breath of fresh air in this [ __ ] up

5601.199 --> 5605.678999999999
world

5602.8 --> 5605.679
it really is

5608.27 --> 5616.1990000000005
[Music]

5613.199 --> 5616.199
ah

5625.679 --> 5630.4
yeah anime is good for yeah the the

5627.76 --> 5631.52
animes that do that are like really good

5630.4 --> 5634.719
at it

5631.52 --> 5639.1990000000005
they do know how to do that

5634.719 --> 5639.199
how to just make something not sexual

5642.719 --> 5647.679
and more focused more on just like the

5645.12 --> 5649.92
the humanity of it and they do it so

5647.679 --> 5649.92
well

5650.96 --> 5653.67
at least in this one they do it really

5652.56 --> 5656.85
well

5653.67 --> 5656.85
[Music]

5674.36 --> 5677.5199999999995
[Music]

5678.0 --> 5682.32
ah borders boy yeah yeah

5681.04 --> 5685.119
well

5682.32 --> 5688.08
i think that the series is actually

5685.119 --> 5690.4
playing on that as a sci-fi element i

5688.08 --> 5692.32
think they really are doing that and

5690.4 --> 5694.879999999999
it's fascinating it's fascinating to

5692.32 --> 5694.88
think about

5697.199 --> 5700.44
but yeah

5700.48 --> 5704.32
it's kind of what this the yeah what the

5702.8 --> 5706.639
series suggests

5704.32 --> 5709.679
that the romans might have brought it

5706.639 --> 5711.52
back from japan

5709.679 --> 5714.0
but in this series it's basically the

5711.52 --> 5716.4800000000005
guy got the inspiration from the future

5714.0 --> 5716.48
japan

5717.28 --> 5720.84
it's really weird

5732.96 --> 5735.199

6004.239 --> 6008.5599999999995
well it's usually like when somebody

6006.239 --> 6010.32
else comes on with me

6008.56 --> 6014.2390000000005
but i had like an early word show with

6010.32 --> 6014.239
nathan on and there were like

6014.56 --> 6018.2390000000005
300 live viewers

6057.28 --> 6061.119
they're gonna talk technical technical

6059.36 --> 6063.44
and they flat earth or anti-flat earth

6061.119 --> 6064.96
they're technical technical technical

6063.44 --> 6066.719
right

6064.96 --> 6069.119
and i typically

6066.719 --> 6070.639
like to reserve that sort of thing

6069.119 --> 6073.04
just for the flat earth debates where

6070.639 --> 6076.159000000001
everybody's really into that and i

6073.04 --> 6079.36
kind of make room to get into that too

6076.159 --> 6083.28
but over here on my own show

6079.36 --> 6083.28
i just like to get all over the place

6085.36 --> 6090.719
and if i draw in the guys from fed yeah

6088.08 --> 6094.4
that's not gonna happen in that show

6090.719 --> 6096.96
but yeah might still be worth it

6094.4 --> 6099.96
it'd be nice to have just a bit of

6096.96 --> 6099.96
change

6100.09 --> 6103.22
[Music]

6109.44 --> 6114.159
i don't know if i can actually get

6111.6 --> 6116.08
nathan on my show though

6114.159 --> 6118.5599999999995
on the early bird show because he's like

6116.08 --> 6121.76
already too busy

6118.56 --> 6123.72
and he has the the pre-show which is

6121.76 --> 6124.96
during my show

6123.72 --> 6127.52
[Music]

6124.96 --> 6128.719
he's in in his pre-show recording right

6127.52 --> 6131.360000000001
now

6128.719 --> 6133.36
in the last 20 minutes

6131.36 --> 6135.199
so it's kind of tough getting him on

6133.36 --> 6137.759999999999
right now

6135.199 --> 6139.5199999999995
but maybe anthony reilly i could get him

6137.76 --> 6142.400000000001
i'm sleeping warrior

6139.52 --> 6144.4800000000005
if he's up for that

6142.4 --> 6147.48
i don't know how early he gets up these

6144.48 --> 6147.48
days

6150.159 --> 6154.36
or if he has the time for that

6171.36 --> 6174.639
what was the question

6174.8 --> 6178.639
fm 888

6176.56 --> 6182.56
the question was if you know the series

6178.639 --> 6182.56
that i just linked from the imdb

6182.88 --> 6186.679
have you ever seen that

6194.32 --> 6199.92
have you thought about running it after

6196.719 --> 6202.719
nathan yeah no that's not gonna work

6199.92 --> 6205.28
like after the show ends

6202.719 --> 6207.04
most of the time we end up still talking

6205.28 --> 6210.159
for at least an hour

6207.04 --> 6214.56
borders boy there's no time after

6210.159 --> 6217.28
also i'm i usually like a bit

6214.56 --> 6219.84
just tired after

6217.28 --> 6222.8
i originally did the early bird show so

6219.84 --> 6225.52
i would stop being so rambly

6222.8 --> 6227.679
on nathan's show

6225.52 --> 6229.76
because i was just being very dominant

6227.679 --> 6232.8
because i had a lot of things to say but

6229.76 --> 6234.96
i didn't really have my own show so then

6232.8 --> 6237.52
nathan said like why don't you do your

6234.96 --> 6238.96
own little show before it and then i did

6237.52 --> 6241.52
that

6238.96 --> 6242.96
and then i became a lot more reserved

6241.52 --> 6244.639
and

6242.96 --> 6246.88
not so dominant

6244.639 --> 6250.2390000000005
and that i think that he thought it

6246.88 --> 6252.4800000000005
improved his show and yeah my show was

6250.239 --> 6254.5599999999995
great

6252.48 --> 6256.5599999999995
i'm still happy with the early bird show

6254.56 --> 6261.84
even though i'm not always super

6256.56 --> 6261.84
satisfied with how fluid i am on it

6262.159 --> 6268.0
i'm not gonna get stressed out over that

6264.88 --> 6268.0
detail either

6269.6 --> 6274.58
i just try to keep drawing in

6272.48 --> 6275.759999999999
interesting things that'll make

6274.58 --> 6278.8
[Music]

6275.76 --> 6280.0
the not so good things about how i do

6278.8 --> 6283.119000000001
the show

6280.0 --> 6284.96
still worth it to sit through

6283.119 --> 6286.08
kind of like fishing right i mean

6284.96 --> 6288.2390000000005
fishing

6286.08 --> 6291.04
is technically boring as [ __ ] you're

6288.239 --> 6293.28
just sitting there waiting is like that

6291.04 --> 6294.639
could be hours now is that really the

6293.28 --> 6298.4
interesting part

6294.639 --> 6301.4400000000005
or is it the the rare times or regular

6298.4 --> 6303.839999999999
times where fish actually bites

6301.44 --> 6303.839999999999
right

6304.88 --> 6309.76
so that's how i

6306.719 --> 6312.4
try to mix in just being me here being

6309.76 --> 6314.08
natural and sometimes silent and a bit

6312.4 --> 6316.5599999999995
boring or like

6314.08 --> 6318.96
not super confident

6316.56 --> 6320.8
in the moment

6318.96 --> 6324.2390000000005
and exchange that with

6320.8 --> 6329.4400000000005
great learning moments

6324.239 --> 6331.44
deep like very specific analysis details

6329.44 --> 6333.839999999999
and of course the whole range of my

6331.44 --> 6338.08
mechanical lore spirit mechanics

6333.84 --> 6338.08
psychology etc etc etc

6339.36 --> 6342.759999999999
right anyway

6347.36 --> 6351.759999999999

snow is certainly persisting but a lot

6467.76 --> 6471.92
of it is

6469.28 --> 6473.84
i think it's just sublimated away

6471.92 --> 6478.28
because the snow is a lot lower now than

6473.84 --> 6478.28
it was even at the start of this show

6492.719 --> 6495.04
hmm

6497.36 --> 6501.679
just remained so incredibly clouded up

6500.0 --> 6505.44
there though
