and yeah it's kind of wind still and

83.84 --> 87.43900000000001
peaceful and

84.64 --> 88.0
even a little bit warm because there has

87.439 --> 90.96
been

88.0 --> 91.439
plenty of sun around despite it being

90.96 --> 94.079
somewhat

91.439 --> 97.03999999999999
dimmed up by the clouds right now also

94.079 --> 100.39999999999999
there does seem to be some kind of haze

97.04 --> 103.60000000000001
up there which suspiciously is

100.4 --> 109.28
sorta chemtrail or trail

103.6 --> 109.28
based looking but i yeah i didn't see it

110.0 --> 117.759
and yeah it's not all spread out

115.759 --> 118.799
but yeah pretty nice day i haven't

117.759 --> 122.799
really been out

118.799 --> 122.799
yet except for smoking

127.2 --> 131.28
even though i did get up quite early

128.879 --> 131.28
today

131.36 --> 137.36
right yeah sorry for being a little late

135.2 --> 140.56
here

137.36 --> 140.56
i got green tea with me

140.64 --> 145.76
yeah i was distracted because uh yeah

144.0 --> 149.28
the iron realm media

145.76 --> 151.28
is still going or the yeah iron works

149.28 --> 152.64000000000001
that tuesday shown is pretty interesting

151.28 --> 154.879
it's still going

152.64 --> 156.0
and also very weirdly enough owen

154.879 --> 158.0
benjamin just basically

156.0 --> 160.64
did a premiere on d life and that was

158.0 --> 160.64
like what

160.879 --> 164.72
so yeah i got a bit distracted there

167.92 --> 172.39999999999998
yeah i don't really have all the time

170.8 --> 176.0
slot to myself but

172.4 --> 179.12
yeah whatever is what it is

176.0 --> 181.519
uh so

179.12 --> 182.879
let's see who's in chat eagle playing

181.519 --> 185.20000000000002
anchor was first stop

182.879 --> 186.07999999999998

obamacare yeah good to see you all

190.0 --> 193.04
it's tuesday

196.319 --> 201.83999999999997
oh [ __ ] i just noticed i didn't make any

199.04 --> 206.0
notes for yesterday what the

201.84 --> 206.0
just staring at this paper and now i see

206.08 --> 213.84
okay let's fill that up quick

214.239 --> 220.48000000000002
yeah the flat earth debate yesterday was

218.159 --> 220.48
weird

221.519 --> 231.20000000000002
it was kind of fun but yeah

224.84 --> 231.20000000000002
i i noticed a disturbance in the force

231.84 --> 238.159
that was a mistake and

236.08 --> 241.84
right it's after show stuff so i don't

238.159 --> 241.84
know what nathan's going to do with it

249.28 --> 256.32
read my joke i have black tea with me it

252.879 --> 259.519
keeps protesting the sugar resistance

256.32 --> 262.4
well don't use white sugar then it's not

259.519 --> 262.4
good for you anyway

263.12 --> 266.32
yeah very funny

266.479 --> 274.639
sugar privilege okay

270.4 --> 282.0
right uh

274.639 --> 285.52
what else

282.0 --> 288.56
yeah there was an own benjamin

285.52 --> 288.56
that wasn't right

288.72 --> 299.6
one day

297.12 --> 299.6
okay

306.88 --> 311.52
all right okay i guess i'm going to have

308.639 --> 313.919
to do a slow start

311.52 --> 325.84
i i really kind of want to take it more

313.919 --> 325.84
easy anyway

335.52 --> 340.479
okay it's fairy tales

344.16 --> 348.88000000000005
okay let me just browse through youtube

346.479 --> 348.88
see if

349.28 --> 354.479
something comes back to mind

364.88 --> 368.479
i think yeah but owen benjamin did just

367.84 --> 372.08
really go

368.479 --> 374.96
live right he did or

372.08 --> 376.479
is this some mislocated memory from the

374.96 --> 378.15999999999997
day before

376.479 --> 379.59999999999997
no it can't be because he didn't go live

378.16 --> 382.88000000000005
on sunday it's just uh

379.6 --> 386.24
whatever but i remember he him

382.88 --> 387.919
basically continuing on the same trump

386.24 --> 390.40000000000003
slaughterhouse

387.919 --> 391.039
situation and while the stream today

390.4 --> 395.84
that he

391.039 --> 395.84
pretty much started up 30 minutes ago

395.919 --> 403.919
he went in depth into explaining

400.24 --> 405.919
why and what the function was and was

403.919 --> 407.44
that's partially why it's just like

405.919 --> 408.639
frustrating because it was pretty

407.44 --> 411.28
interesting

408.639 --> 414.319
and now i can't follow it because it's

411.28 --> 414.31899999999996
during my own show

414.88 --> 417.36
oh well

420.84 --> 423.84
uh

425.199 --> 430.40000000000003
right well my memory goes as

428.4 --> 432.15999999999997
far as far as that i was high

430.4 --> 433.52
performance on the flat earth debate

432.16 --> 437.84000000000003
yesterday

433.52 --> 437.84
for the times i got involved

438.08 --> 445.28
fluid and clear

441.44 --> 448.56
i like that uh oh yeah

445.28 --> 451.84
right oh now i remember now i remember

448.56 --> 451.84
what it got blurred up

453.84 --> 457.75899999999996
yeah yeah yeah i discovered a massive

456.639 --> 459.84000000000003
mistake

457.759 --> 461.44
it's really annoying and yeah thanks

459.84 --> 465.039
rasta hat oh it's so

461.44 --> 468.24
funny to you so funny

465.039 --> 469.84
yeah but yeah i discovered that i've

468.24 --> 473.28000000000003
basically been switching around

469.84 --> 479.75899999999996
two words in my even in my

473.28 --> 482.479
perspective drawing and

479.759 --> 484.72
yeah i don't know how it happened but i

482.479 --> 487.28
literally switched around refraction and

484.72 --> 492.0
diffraction it's pretty bizarre

487.28 --> 494.87899999999996
like suddenly seeing that

492.0 --> 497.039
so yeah i guess a mistake easily fixed

494.879 --> 500.24
but the thing is i basically have now

497.039 --> 500.96
two years of just explaining and showing

500.24 --> 504.0
pictures

500.96 --> 507.12
of it switched around and that just

504.0 --> 510.08
really really sucks

507.12 --> 510.08
to realize that

511.36 --> 521.839
because i can't do anything about it

513.279 --> 521.8389999999999
it's just tainted now

522.76 --> 525.85
[Music]

528.24 --> 533.279
because it was not just like oops i

530.8 --> 535.68
switched around the words no i literally

533.279 --> 537.68
imprinted the wrong meanings on the

535.68 --> 541.04
words in the switched setting and is

537.68 --> 541.04
very difficult to deal with

541.44 --> 545.839
because i've been kind of railroading

543.279 --> 548.88
myself in order to

545.839 --> 553.2790000000001
yeah get it out there but i did it wrong

548.88 --> 553.279
and it really really sucks

561.519 --> 566.48
the david weiss put a video with owen

563.44 --> 566.48
benjamin oh sure

566.959 --> 570.959
i i didn't i s i did see the pop-up i

569.12 --> 577.839
didn't watch it

570.959 --> 577.8389999999999
it was still during the after show

581.91 --> 584.9699999999999
[Music]

588.839 --> 593.44
ugh

590.399 --> 597.68
uh right so that pretty much

593.44 --> 599.519
made me kind of pissed off yesterday

597.68 --> 601.1999999999999
on the moment of year i really threw it

599.519 --> 602.9590000000001
out there i don't know how many of you

601.2 --> 605.2
have heard that

602.959 --> 608.2399999999999
now rasta did because he's the one that

605.2 --> 608.24
actually hurt me

608.32 --> 612.0
and basically yeah told me that i don't

610.8 --> 615.04
know he says

612.0 --> 617.279
he says right that he said that before

615.04 --> 621.279
but i was unable to pick it up in the

617.279 --> 621.279
moments that he said it apparently

624.16 --> 629.04
if he did so he didn't double check if

627.68 --> 631.3599999999999
it got through to me or

629.04 --> 632.16
maybe i was getting personal and

631.36 --> 633.92
offensive

632.16 --> 635.68
that you noticed and then you didn't

633.92 --> 637.12
inquire further i guess that's kind of

635.68 --> 639.4399999999999
the strategy that i would

637.12 --> 641.04
also do it's just really frustrating

639.44 --> 641.44
realizing you're on the other side

641.04 --> 644.8389999999999
they're

641.44 --> 647.839
really really [ __ ] frustrating

644.839 --> 647.839
uh

648.45 --> 651.57
[Music]

654.12 --> 661.76
[Music]

658.839 --> 664.6400000000001
anyway

661.76 --> 666.88
yeah too touchy but it's also because

664.64 --> 668.3199999999999
look during the entire development of

666.88 --> 671.4399999999999
optics and i've always said

668.32 --> 672.32
it's very difficult to me it is always

671.44 --> 676.399
has been

672.32 --> 679.839
like i have a feel for it but

676.399 --> 681.839
it's so many different things

679.839 --> 683.839
pieces that are all involved all

681.839 --> 685.44
entangled with one another it gives me a

683.839 --> 688.0
headache

685.44 --> 690.5600000000001
and because i was really basically from

688.0 --> 692.0
ground up trying to figure out a pure

690.56 --> 695.04
understanding

692.0 --> 697.2
i had to fend off other people's

695.04 --> 698.7199999999999
explanations a lot because everybody was

697.2 --> 700.88
digging but they were digging in all

698.72 --> 702.72
directions and much more sloppy in my

700.88 --> 705.92
opinion

702.72 --> 706.9590000000001
and i i just had to carefully do that

705.92 --> 709.76
but

706.959 --> 710.3199999999999
i wish i had realized this it's just

709.76 --> 712.16
really

710.32 --> 714.32
it feels like my mind played a trick on

712.16 --> 714.3199999999999
me

715.04 --> 717.8389999999999
of course we're cool

722.72 --> 726.24
i'm not pissed off at you

728.88 --> 732.399
i'm pissed off at myself that i didn't

731.6 --> 735.279
get it

732.399 --> 736.88
first just feel embarrassed to be human

735.279 --> 740.16
again

736.88 --> 742.399
ugh you know i talk about it all the

740.16 --> 745.6
time how that works and then it happens

742.399 --> 749.04
and it's like yeah

745.6 --> 751.8100000000001
talk about it all day doesn't mean that

749.04 --> 754.99
you'll be able to avoid it for yourself

751.81 --> 754.9899999999999
[Music]

756.16 --> 762.24
right but as usual i will do everything

759.76 --> 762.959
humanly possible to get absolutely

762.24 --> 764.88
everything

762.959 --> 767.5189999999999
i can out of my mistakes and i'm doing

764.88 --> 767.519
that right now

768.399 --> 772.24
because other people will probably be

770.24 --> 775.44
faced with similar

772.24 --> 777.04
very concerning mistakes might be so

775.44 --> 777.839
concerning they even have to keep it a

777.04 --> 780.3199999999999
secret for

777.839 --> 781.12
them to themselves or they get in real

780.32 --> 787.279
trouble like

781.12 --> 789.76
their boss or work whatever

787.279 --> 792.48
how do you re-railroad it how do you

789.76 --> 792.48
correct it

792.8 --> 799.68
no because you can

797.279 --> 801.92
now i am very open and honest so i don't

799.68 --> 804.399
have to worry about keeping it a secret

801.92 --> 806.16
oh my god my reputation i had a mistake

804.399 --> 810.16
for two years

806.16 --> 813.1999999999999
oh god no yeah well i make mistakes i

810.16 --> 815.4399999999999
already conceded that

813.2 --> 818.24
and yeah the most important but the

815.44 --> 822.0
thing about is you correct them

818.24 --> 823.92
the mandela right yeah now i'm not gonna

822.0 --> 829.839
throw that on the mandela effect that's

823.92 --> 829.8389999999999
just silly

837.92 --> 844.399
no but i think i hope

841.36 --> 846.9590000000001
that if it's all now truly in place

844.399 --> 850.24
that'll also mean that maybe i will let

846.959 --> 852.3199999999999
have less of a pushback in

850.24 --> 854.0
gaining this full oversight because it

852.32 --> 856.639
is like a crystal to me

854.0 --> 860.0
and apparently this switch still allowed

856.639 --> 862.32
it to function but it would convolute

860.0 --> 863.36
connective understanding into the outer

862.32 --> 866.639
world because of it

863.36 --> 868.839
and stay isolated of myself

866.639 --> 870.0790000000001
like i would not be able to connect it

868.839 --> 871.7600000000001
eventually

870.079 --> 873.5999999999999
because i'm pretty sure there are people

871.76 --> 877.04
that have full understanding

873.6 --> 879.76
even though they might not be sharing it

877.04 --> 880.3199999999999
but because i had that mistake yeah it

879.76 --> 884.56
would

880.32 --> 887.36
connect less and now that i got it right

884.56 --> 889.68
which i to my intuition is still like

887.36 --> 892.8000000000001
very confused about this

889.68 --> 895.3599999999999
i have to re-attune myself

892.8 --> 896.3199999999999
and then see like is and then eventually

895.36 --> 899.44
like really

896.32 --> 901.839
confirm it on a deeper level

899.44 --> 904.639
in my virtual building once it's settled

901.839 --> 904.639
all the stress

905.519 --> 909.199
and then who knows maybe i will finally

908.0 --> 912.56
overcome that in

909.199 --> 913.8389999999999
understanding obstacles in a more

912.56 --> 916.56
permanent fashion

913.839 --> 916.5600000000001
because of this

921.36 --> 927.839
do a video with it yeah of course i will

924.079 --> 927.8389999999999
i was already gonna do that

931.04 --> 939.279
it's just that i forgot about it

936.16 --> 941.36
see how that works i literally it's it's

939.279 --> 944.0
so sucky

941.36 --> 947.279
and i focus always to basically get up

944.0 --> 947.279
freshly in a new day

949.12 --> 956.399
and yeah i kind of forgot about it

953.279 --> 959.279
it wasn't very deeply hidden

956.399 --> 962.48
but i did forget about it and thus i was

959.279 --> 962.48
also not bothered with it

965.12 --> 974.16
a convolution of terms

969.12 --> 976.88
right well or a mix-up

974.16 --> 978.24
literally is quite quite a perfect

976.88 --> 980.56
switch so

978.24 --> 982.16
the weird thing is this is what i try to

980.56 --> 985.68
explain it is basically a

982.16 --> 987.68
semantic error the problem was is that

985.68 --> 989.7589999999999
the semantic error

987.68 --> 991.92
did not stick to just being a semantic

989.759 --> 994.72
error in my mind for that entire period

991.92 --> 996.4799999999999
and my entire inside basically crystal

994.72 --> 1000.0790000000001
crystallized around that semantic

996.48 --> 1000.0790000000001
mistake that's my problem

1000.959 --> 1007.92
ah now i have to unrail wrote that

1004.24 --> 1011.199
as i call it right

1007.92 --> 1015.5999999999999
a zip tippy and yeah

1011.199 --> 1015.5999999999999
seven men like me

1023.759 --> 1039.839
i'm okay it's good whether it's nice

1026.0 --> 1039.839
it's calm

1064.84 --> 1067.84
hey

1078.72 --> 1081.84
have a like thanks

1092.84 --> 1095.84
right

1097.76 --> 1103.2
anyway i'm yeah open for discussions at

1100.72 --> 1103.2
this point

1105.44 --> 1109.8400000000001
in the meanwhile i can basically

1111.2 --> 1115.28
spend some of my time right now to

1113.2 --> 1118.32
correct

1115.28 --> 1120.16
the optical slant picture it's a very

1118.32 --> 1123.76
basic procedure because i only have to

1120.16 --> 1127.44
switch out two words basically

1123.76 --> 1127.44
oh wait no no no

1127.84 --> 1137.84
where are ya

1139.679 --> 1143.6000000000001
it's great i had to put it all over

1141.36 --> 1143.6
there

1148.84 --> 1153.6
okay

1151.039 --> 1153.6
okay

1156.32 --> 1160.6399999999999
i'll get back to chat every now and then

1161.6 --> 1168.48
oh god rasta hat i don't care

1165.36 --> 1168.4799999999998
ah come on man

1170.0 --> 1179.84
i'm not that amused by that

1185.84 --> 1189.76
it feels entitled to a larger cup really

1188.799 --> 1193.84
so how large

1189.76 --> 1193.84
is the cup of tea

1196.48 --> 1208.96
that's flat so it's question by the way

1206.32 --> 1208.96
uh wait

1210.4 --> 1216.0
okay oh all right yeah it's really going

1213.2 --> 1216.0
to be an easy

1218.84 --> 1221.84
exchange

1233.919 --> 1238.0800000000002
ha brilliant i even had

1247.44 --> 1250.88
oh there might be some font

1252.559 --> 1263.84
right whatever

1265.679 --> 1270.0800000000002
kind of have to do it by intuition right

1268.559 --> 1277.76
okay that

1270.08 --> 1281.1999999999998
should do yeah

1277.76 --> 1284.559
that's good enough for me so it's gonna

1281.2 --> 1284.559
have to be good enough for you

1286.48 --> 1293.76
save as uh all right okay this is

1290.559 --> 1293.76
version 1.3

1295.039 --> 1305.84
okay let's move this

1298.32 --> 1305.84
freaking thing

1307.28 --> 1309.76
that's

1316.84 --> 1319.84
better

1320.559 --> 1328.08
all right sorry for uh yeah delay but

1324.96 --> 1329.8400000000001
i don't really have anything special

1328.08 --> 1331.6
else to talk about and i wanted to

1329.84 --> 1332.0
really kind of try to keep it a little

1331.6 --> 1334.6399999999999
easy

1332.0 --> 1335.52
today because i've been kind of like

1334.64 --> 1338.64
over

1335.52 --> 1340.96
exciting myself recently

1338.64 --> 1340.96
uh

1342.159 --> 1347.8400000000001
wait no i'm gonna do this

1350.32 --> 1353.84
oh damn it

1355.6 --> 1361.84
what oh right right

1362.34 --> 1369.9189999999999
[Music]

1366.559 --> 1369.9189999999999
yes got him

1372.84 --> 1376.799
uh

1374.08 --> 1376.799
i'm going to share it

1377.52 --> 1384.1589999999999
come on come on yes

1380.559 --> 1384.1589999999999
oh god why is it so small

1397.36 --> 1403.9189999999999
okay yeah

1400.88 --> 1407.0390000000002
looks a bit messy but yeah i just

1403.919 --> 1409.039
switched around the two words there

1407.039 --> 1412.24
wait let me just do that it properly in

1409.039 --> 1417.84
a full window

1412.24 --> 1417.84
hold on

1418.08 --> 1421.4399999999998
all right that's much better

1428.84 --> 1431.84
wait

1433.039 --> 1445.84
yay it's still an eyeball and a stick

1469.36 --> 1476.08
yeah but sept happy

1472.48 --> 1479.1200000000001
the voting system is rigged as [ __ ]

1476.08 --> 1481.039
this is just not real it hasn't been for

1479.12 --> 1482.9599999999998
a long time and it's been times where

1481.039 --> 1483.84
the fights are great and then like after

1482.96 --> 1488.0
an hour i got

1483.84 --> 1492.24
zero zero they they reduce it to zero

1488.0 --> 1494.96
so i still call for it though

1492.24 --> 1498.32
because it shouldn't be like that this

1494.96 --> 1501.76
is literal just political rigging

1498.32 --> 1505.36
makes no sense

1501.76 --> 1507.679
it's like not even really informing

1505.36 --> 1509.12
or getting giving notification of a

1507.679 --> 1511.279
reason why or if

1509.12 --> 1514.3999999999999
this should even be if this is even

1511.279 --> 1516.64
supposed to be like that

1514.4 --> 1519.039
this just this dishonest mechanical

1516.64 --> 1519.039
rigging

1524.64 --> 1528.5590000000002
i don't know if youtube does it or if

1527.44 --> 1531.679
somebody is just

1528.559 --> 1533.44
hacking the data that i get or that is

1531.679 --> 1534.64
eventually put out there i don't know

1533.44 --> 1536.96
what's going on

1534.64 --> 1539.3600000000001
but i just know the votes are rigged as

1536.96 --> 1539.3600000000001
[ __ ]

1539.52 --> 1544.08
i don't know if it is youtube doing it

1541.44 --> 1546.3200000000002
or if it's some agency or whatever

1544.08 --> 1546.32
man

1549.84 --> 1557.84
yeah it is insane it is insane that's

1554.84 --> 1557.84
correct

1560.18 --> 1565.3600000000001
[Music]

1563.36 --> 1567.6
dude i've been talking about this for

1565.36 --> 1567.6
like

1568.4 --> 1572.72
yeah over a year it's been with my

1571.36 --> 1576.4799999999998
subscribers

1572.72 --> 1577.3600000000001
makes no sense like when i certainly get

1576.48 --> 1581.279
a lot of reach

1577.36 --> 1583.039
audibly people say hello to me in chat

1581.279 --> 1586.159
everywhere

1583.039 --> 1589.6
that my subscribers just went

1586.159 --> 1589.6000000000001
up a hundred

1589.84 --> 1595.279
in like two years or something

1592.88 --> 1597.3600000000001
like eventually i really hit that mark

1595.279 --> 1599.6
and then it just kept stuck

1597.36 --> 1600.4799999999998
and just and recently i was all

1599.6 --> 1603.6789999999999
surprised that i

1600.48 --> 1608.08
went past the 1800 marker

1603.679 --> 1612.159
because it had been stuck on like 70 60

1608.08 --> 1615.039
for almost a year a year

1612.159 --> 1615.919
that it hang around that and just at

1615.039 --> 1619.279
some point it

1615.919 --> 1621.76
it went up to 70 and so i just

1619.279 --> 1623.12
i've never seen such insane slow growth

1621.76 --> 1625.36
it's like

1623.12 --> 1626.1589999999999
like i'm literally a guy that nobody

1625.36 --> 1630.24
knows

1626.159 --> 1630.24
that type speed suggestion it's

1638.84 --> 1641.84
ridiculous

1652.24 --> 1658.88
and also it's very noticeable to me that

1657.039 --> 1660.1589999999999
i don't get a lot of people contacting

1658.88 --> 1664.0800000000002
me you know

1660.159 --> 1668.64
compared to i guess other people

1664.08 --> 1671.9189999999999
that have higher reach i don't know why

1668.64 --> 1673.039
i get people from bottom up uh just from

1671.919 --> 1675.65
the grass root type

1673.039 --> 1676.96
like you guys in chat i get just people

1675.65 --> 1680.8400000000001
[Music]

1676.96 --> 1682.559
but i don't get any like oh do this do

1680.84 --> 1685.52
that

1682.559 --> 1686.0
maybe it is because yeah because i guess

1685.52 --> 1689.6
sort of

1686.0 --> 1690.32
a litmus test on hey do you want to go

1689.6 --> 1691.9189999999999
on the tour

1690.32 --> 1694.1589999999999
all of a sudden out of nowhere i

1691.919 --> 1696.5590000000002
stressed the [ __ ] out back in during the

1694.159 --> 1699.2
amsterdam conference right before that

1696.559 --> 1701.76
and maybe they think i can't handle it i

1699.2 --> 1701.76
get that

1701.84 --> 1705.9189999999999
i'm not much of a tour guide

1706.64 --> 1710.48
but that doesn't mean that i can't just

1709.12 --> 1713.6789999999999
work

1710.48 --> 1717.039
that i can't help

1713.679 --> 1720.48
out in many ways and i do

1717.039 --> 1722.32
i do that i comment i i i'm always a

1720.48 --> 1724.64
teacher i can't help it

1722.32 --> 1727.36
or i just try to make people laugh

1724.64 --> 1731.039
because it's also teaching

1727.36 --> 1732.6399999999999
it's i correct people i do everything i

1731.039 --> 1735.12
do everything everywhere

1732.64 --> 1736.7990000000002
always i can't help it it's i'm addicted

1735.12 --> 1739.4399999999998
to it this is what i'm i feel like

1736.799 --> 1745.36
that's what i'm supposed to do it's my

1739.44 --> 1745.3600000000001
yeah i just do what i do

1747.52 --> 1749.84
and

1751.279 --> 1759.2
right i'm always about improvising

1755.919 --> 1760.48
always so i am not good in like oh i'm

1759.2 --> 1764.8400000000001
going to make a

1760.48 --> 1767.84
recorded presentation how many recorded

1764.84 --> 1767.84
presentations

1770.399 --> 1773.76
do you know of me

1774.24 --> 1778.24
where it's literally like oh i'm gonna

1776.159 --> 1783.2
have a video about this i'd

1778.24 --> 1783.2
i've never done that because

1783.279 --> 1792.08
i i it my entities don't come

1788.559 --> 1794.399
it doesn't work for me

1792.08 --> 1795.36
it's just i'm not that effective with

1794.399 --> 1797.4399999999998
that

1795.36 --> 1798.399
i'm more effective with such things i

1797.44 --> 1802.159
guess

1798.399 --> 1804.799
as a maybe from a designer's perspective

1802.159 --> 1804.7990000000002
but yeah

1805.2 --> 1811.76
it feels off i just

1808.48 --> 1813.44
want to do it natural just direct always

1811.76 --> 1817.84
just

1813.44 --> 1819.52
basically saying it out loud every time

1817.84 --> 1821.36
and then saying it better and better and

1819.52 --> 1824.799
better and better and then

1821.36 --> 1827.36
yeah it's maybe slower

1824.799 --> 1829.52
more prone to mistakes but that means

1827.36 --> 1831.52
that eventually instead of having had

1829.52 --> 1834.6399999999999
the presentation

1831.52 --> 1837.9189999999999
that doesn't in effect master your skill

1834.64 --> 1840.0800000000002
it just puts it down well enough instead

1837.919 --> 1844.88
of that

1840.08 --> 1844.8799999999999
i literally become the knowledge

1847.919 --> 1853.679
and that's also why i'm so frustrated

1850.32 --> 1853.6789999999999
about having that error

1862.84 --> 1865.84
see

1866.48 --> 1880.159
the introvert's curse is it can be

1878.24 --> 1883.519
but i don't know in a way i'm both

1880.159 --> 1883.519
introvert and extrovert

1885.44 --> 1889.679
it's just that usually the introvert

1889.2 --> 1893.279
kind of

1889.679 --> 1897.519
sacrifices the extrovert

1893.279 --> 1902.159
rich powers energy to favor the focus

1897.519 --> 1904.88
on the introvert skills or the extrovert

1902.159 --> 1906.7990000000002
shies away from the introversy it's

1904.88 --> 1909.519
often too confronting

1906.799 --> 1911.519
or something too much hurt maybe and

1909.519 --> 1914.559
then they throw it out there and like

1911.519 --> 1918.64
bloom up in the extrovert skills

1914.559 --> 1921.2
well i started out introvert

1918.64 --> 1922.24
and then realized i still had extrovert

1921.2 --> 1925.039
skills

1922.24 --> 1927.36
was just like out of reach it was it was

1925.039 --> 1930.48
very

1927.36 --> 1932.24
lonely painful also knowing that i could

1930.48 --> 1934.88
do more it's not like i

1932.24 --> 1935.44
can never get out of this so i'll just

1934.88 --> 1939.1200000000001
settle

1935.44 --> 1943.679
with what i am right now no i knew i had

1939.12 --> 1947.6
[ __ ] i just was introvert

1943.679 --> 1948.3990000000001
so i had to slowly slowly break that

1947.6 --> 1952.1589999999999
open

1948.399 --> 1952.1589999999999
and now yeah i'm pretty far

1952.399 --> 1956.32
because i kind of made it into my public

1954.32 --> 1958.24
project you can't get more extrovert

1956.32 --> 1959.6789999999999
than literally addressing the entire

1958.24 --> 1962.19
world

1959.679 --> 1968.259
live recorded

1962.19 --> 1968.259
[Music]

1976.32 --> 1979.4399999999998
so i balance it out

1977.78 --> 1982.48
[Music]

1979.44 --> 1982.48
extrovert time

1982.72 --> 1987.44
and then i retract and then i like

1985.36 --> 1990.6399999999999
really need to

1987.44 --> 1993.679
so i can get the introvert

1990.64 --> 1993.679
things going again

1997.2 --> 2004.72
i could metaphorize it in a pretty

2001.12 --> 2008.0
weird way not gonna do that

2004.72 --> 2011.279
not gonna yeah

2008.0 --> 2019.84
but it is a mechanism

2011.279 --> 2019.84
that kind of works

2022.96 --> 2027.2
it's weird when you talk to people for

2025.679 --> 2030.24
years over the internet

2027.2 --> 2033.519
then to then meet them in real life

2030.24 --> 2037.279
yeah can be but to me

2033.519 --> 2039.039
it's literally it's the same person

2037.279 --> 2040.48
it is it was to me like when i met

2039.039 --> 2044.72
nathan oakley

2040.48 --> 2047.3600000000001
it's like literally what i feel of him

2044.72 --> 2048.399
know of him on the internet that's him

2047.36 --> 2050.56
it's just that

2048.399 --> 2052.56
there's also like the rest of the

2050.56 --> 2056.0
physical body

2052.56 --> 2057.679
and like the physical presence energy

2056.0 --> 2060.56
and some of the things that you can't

2057.679 --> 2063.359
hide face to face

2060.56 --> 2063.359
when i met him

2064.079 --> 2069.3590000000004
and so it is like whoa dude and i i'm

2067.119 --> 2071.28
sure i had the same reaction to many

2069.359 --> 2072.48
other people as well they were probably

2071.28 --> 2074.7200000000003
weirded out

2072.48 --> 2076.879
by me it was kind of my real first

2074.72 --> 2080.48
appearance kind of way

2076.879 --> 2080.48
to prove that i'm not cgi

2081.28 --> 2087.119
uh and i have that too

2084.879 --> 2089.04
and i'm i'm trying to even be open about

2087.119 --> 2091.2000000000003
it like

2089.04 --> 2092.879
i i guess some people have experienced

2091.2 --> 2096.0789999999997
being with me

2092.879 --> 2098.72
not saying everyone is like

2096.079 --> 2101.76
stepping into another dimension it's

2098.72 --> 2105.2799999999997
almost like you can step with me into

2101.76 --> 2108.1600000000003
into the virtual world

2105.28 --> 2108.1600000000003
of description

2110.16 --> 2115.2799999999997
it works and it works better when you're

2113.28 --> 2117.8390000000004
actually face to face with me and you

2115.28 --> 2117.8390000000004
dare to

2118.32 --> 2124.8
to open up like that to actually

2122.0 --> 2126.32
trust that i'm not gonna do something

2124.8 --> 2128.32
bad

2126.32 --> 2130.0
and then yeah it becomes even stronger

2128.32 --> 2131.599
than whatever people

2130.0 --> 2145.2
experience over the internet when

2131.599 --> 2147.6800000000003
listening to me and people have gotten

2145.2 --> 2149.5989999999997
to know also just my human flaws like

2147.68 --> 2152.7999999999997
how are my emotions

2149.599 --> 2155.76
i do give it a space

2152.8 --> 2157.599
i can sometimes get outraged a little

2155.76 --> 2160.8
overboard even

2157.599 --> 2163.28
or be very hurt unnecessarily

2160.8 --> 2167.599
this sort of thing still happens so

2163.28 --> 2167.599
people know that i am a human being

2169.28 --> 2172.96
i'm not gonna hide any of that i'm not

2170.72 --> 2176.56
gonna try to pretend like i am

2172.96 --> 2180.7200000000003
more more than human or something

2176.56 --> 2184.64
i just try to be honest and then

2180.72 --> 2187.839
by that standard attain more than human

2184.64 --> 2189.44
by being human and recognizing that and

2187.839 --> 2192.88
then

2189.44 --> 2195.52
expanding from within a human

2192.88 --> 2195.52
perspective

2196.56 --> 2202.16
guided by moral and the inside of

2199.68 --> 2202.16
creation

2206.64 --> 2213.7599999999998
okay cool um yeah that's very nice

2210.48 --> 2216.56
i've had people that that talked to me

2213.76 --> 2216.5600000000004
and like uh

2216.64 --> 2219.92
what's his name again sorry i forget

2218.72 --> 2221.7599999999998
this guy also met

2219.92 --> 2224.2400000000002
in the amsterdam conference great guy

2221.76 --> 2227.0400000000004
but his wife they lived in utrecht

2224.24 --> 2229.2
his wife bumped into me one time and she

2227.04 --> 2232.4
said like hey i know you

2229.2 --> 2232.3999999999996
like what this is

2234.88 --> 2239.359
i killed a hope that's that's the guy

2237.47 --> 2243.839
[Music]

2239.359 --> 2243.839
so that was pretty cool

2255.76 --> 2262.5600000000004
but i do wonder though am i

2259.359 --> 2265.44
much more known percentile wise

2262.56 --> 2266.24
in for example the united states or

2265.44 --> 2269.68
england

2266.24 --> 2273.1189999999997
or the netherlands i wonder

2269.68 --> 2273.7599999999998
i wonder also like because i'm not sure

2273.119 --> 2276.1600000000003
sometimes

2273.76 --> 2279.92
if people kind of know what i do who i

2276.16 --> 2284.3199999999997
am and they just choose to ignore me

2279.92 --> 2287.28
because i don't know my

2284.32 --> 2288.0
memory of how dutch people typically are

2287.28 --> 2290.48
is that they do

2288.0 --> 2293.839
fanatically research something once they

2290.48 --> 2296.96
allow themselves to do so

2293.839 --> 2298.48
and some especially are about

2296.96 --> 2300.4
like people in their neighborhood they

2298.48 --> 2301.04
can be yeah it's like the old village

2300.4 --> 2302.64
effect

2301.04 --> 2304.96
they basically do that through the

2302.64 --> 2306.56
internet

2304.96 --> 2308.48
they just really have to know everything

2306.56 --> 2311.44
about the person

2308.48 --> 2312.0
that's it so i don't know i don't know

2311.44 --> 2314.96
if that

2312.0 --> 2317.2
is also here if people know who i am or

2314.96 --> 2317.2
not

2317.599 --> 2321.28
or if they just think wow that guy is

2320.0 --> 2324.64
weird he's always

2321.28 --> 2326.6400000000003
wearing black and whether black gloves

2324.64 --> 2327.2799999999997
and who does he think he's a jew or

2326.64 --> 2329.2
something

2327.28 --> 2332.2400000000002
i do have the ring and of course the

2329.2 --> 2334.0789999999997
ring being a ten-sided stars most people

2332.24 --> 2336.0
see that and think oh this is excited

2334.079 --> 2339.8390000000004
stories must be as you

2336.0 --> 2342.96
because they don't look i don't care

2339.839 --> 2342.96
so i don't know

2343.44 --> 2346.48
i don't know

2352.96 --> 2359.44
say you was known in uk

2356.0 --> 2363.44
as you visit nathan's is he

2359.44 --> 2368.4
very well known in england

2363.44 --> 2371.28
then i don't know i don't know

2368.4 --> 2372.48
i know he has a yeah there's plenty of

2371.28 --> 2375.0400000000004
british people

2372.48 --> 2378.0
british trolls so i guess by that

2375.04 --> 2383.839
standard he has a wide reach in england

2378.0 --> 2383.839
but i

2385.359 --> 2390.7999999999997
but also the united states or less

2388.72 --> 2392.0
you think that they know me more in

2390.8 --> 2397.119
england than they know

2392.0 --> 2399.599
me in the united states

2397.119 --> 2401.119
and i am basically asking you guys to do

2399.599 --> 2404.4
wet finger work

2401.119 --> 2407.44
unless you have like some grasp on

2404.4 --> 2410.319
real statistics i don't have really good

2407.44 --> 2413.04
sources for that

2410.319 --> 2414.72
i i know they're probably programs on

2413.04 --> 2417.44
how to do that and [ __ ] but

2414.72 --> 2417.4399999999996
uh just

2418.48 --> 2422.48
maybe we should ask mark sargen he seems

2420.4 --> 2426.2400000000002
to have a grip on that sort of thing

2422.48 --> 2428.96
it's done dedicated research

2426.24 --> 2428.9599999999996
statistics

2431.359 --> 2435.44
yeah wet finger work but hey it's better

2434.56 --> 2437.7599999999998
than nothing

2435.44 --> 2439.119
it's just like trying to remember how

2437.76 --> 2442.3190000000004
many people

2439.119 --> 2444.2400000000002
reflected and could you attain ascertain

2442.319 --> 2447.7599999999998
whether they were british

2444.24 --> 2449.68
or american or or i don't know some

2447.76 --> 2453.8390000000004
other european or

2449.68 --> 2455.839
or australian no

2453.839 --> 2459.04
but it is really wet finger we're going

2455.839 --> 2461.7599999999998
by rough memory it's just like trying to

2459.04 --> 2461.7599999999998
weigh it off

2463.2 --> 2466.64
and it's of course going to be very

2464.72 --> 2468.319
scattered because everybody only has the

2466.64 --> 2470.16
experiences where they are present they

2468.319 --> 2474.24
can't experience it all

2470.16 --> 2474.24
so it's just a yeah wet finger work

2479.2 --> 2484.72
unless you have access to good

2480.96 --> 2484.7200000000003
statistics programs like that

2485.2 --> 2489.9199999999996
so just know like okay what are the

2487.2 --> 2493.2799999999997
percentile audience of nathan's

2489.92 --> 2495.839
what are they of my show

2493.28 --> 2495.8390000000004
uh

2502.72 --> 2508.72
what what is so funny about wet finger

2506.839 --> 2510.72
work

2508.72 --> 2514.0
i'm not trying to do any scientific

2510.72 --> 2514.0
inquiry i'm just trying to

2514.88 --> 2517.52
figure out

2520.079 --> 2523.76
how i am reflecting on the world that's

2522.56 --> 2526.0789999999997
all

2523.76 --> 2526.079
it's like

2533.44 --> 2538.56
authority what are you talking about in

2536.0 --> 2538.56
authority

2548.319 --> 2553.2799999999997
the real world what

2560.48 --> 2566.56
it's a dutch saying translated

2563.52 --> 2570.079
in english really it's

2566.56 --> 2570.0789999999997
it doesn't exist in english

2570.24 --> 2576.64
really it it came out so smoothly i'm

2574.56 --> 2580.0
surprised

2576.64 --> 2585.1189999999997
it's just uh quick estimation

2580.0 --> 2585.119
wet finger work right

2585.2 --> 2594.0789999999997
no not sexual god

2589.28 --> 2594.079
this is geesh

2595.839 --> 2600.96
it has a sexual what the [ __ ] is this

2603.52 --> 2624.96
what no no

2621.44 --> 2627.76
okay okay i get it

2624.96 --> 2630.0
well this is a weird language barrier i

2627.76 --> 2630.0
guess

2633.2 --> 2636.96
now there's more of that like my my

2635.76 --> 2640.6400000000003
dad's name

2636.96 --> 2643.28
for example so yeah so very funny

2640.64 --> 2643.2799999999997
hilarious

2643.76 --> 2648.2400000000002
but oh well oh yeah that's a different

2647.2 --> 2651.4399999999996
kind of cookie

2648.24 --> 2651.4399999999996
yeah andre

2653.839 --> 2659.2799999999997
yeah the dutch have many sayings

2656.96 --> 2660.079
and look we've we've been very used

2659.28 --> 2663.44
we've been like

2660.079 --> 2665.599
anglified in a cultural way at a certain

2663.44 --> 2668.0
period

2665.599 --> 2669.3590000000004
where it would become popular to

2668.0 --> 2672.319
basically

2669.359 --> 2675.119
switch to english speak kind of to rub

2672.319 --> 2677.68
english over the dutch

2675.119 --> 2678.6400000000003
i was annoyed shitless but it was very

2677.68 --> 2680.16
annoying

2678.64 --> 2682.48
because it basically just breaks the

2680.16 --> 2682.48
dutch

2683.04 --> 2688.079
but i guess that it's just so easy to

2685.839 --> 2693.839
just switch

2688.079 --> 2693.8390000000004
this is including with sayings

2696.56 --> 2705.839
what about the dutch cricket team

2699.76 --> 2705.8390000000004
i what

2708.319 --> 2711.52
that's not proper dutch

2711.599 --> 2719.839
em yeah

2725.68 --> 2733.5989999999997
oh oh okay

2730.48 --> 2736.4
dude i'm not into dutch sports

2733.599 --> 2736.4
like at all

2737.04 --> 2742.56
but i do kind of like dutch

2740.24 --> 2746.4799999999996
international football and all that

2742.56 --> 2750.319
i guess or soccer not football

2746.48 --> 2754.319
but i don't know i'm overall not that

2750.319 --> 2754.319
much of a sport interested person

2757.359 --> 2762.319
mma fighters god no i don't watch that

2760.0 --> 2762.319
either

2763.04 --> 2769.2
too much empathy like

2766.319 --> 2769.2
literally like it

2771.68 --> 2778.72
but i do know a guy here that i met

2776.48 --> 2780.4
weirdly enough just looks like joe rogan

2778.72 --> 2783.1189999999997
except not so small

2780.4 --> 2783.52
he literally has like the face he knows

2783.119 --> 2786.88
it

2783.52 --> 2788.16
and his daughter like went into the

2786.88 --> 2792.079
championship in

2788.16 --> 2793.68
mma no not or mma or kickboxing or

2792.079 --> 2797.6800000000003
something

2793.68 --> 2799.2
and she i think she even like won the

2797.68 --> 2804.0789999999997
title one time

2799.2 --> 2817.839
so but that's as far as it goes

2804.079 --> 2817.8390000000004
with me knowing about sports really

2821.119 --> 2831.839
i feel final all right

2837.119 --> 2841.2000000000003
i know cricket is an english sport by

2839.2 --> 2845.359
the way except happy

2841.2 --> 2848.72
i know

2845.359 --> 2851.839
like i'm pretty familiar with

2848.72 --> 2854.72
so what the sports that are there

2851.839 --> 2855.359
sort of it's just that i'm not really

2854.72 --> 2859.839
interested

2855.359 --> 2862.96
in like knowing about

2859.839 --> 2862.96
about it all that much

2867.2 --> 2871.839
most sports are english have you ever

2868.96 --> 2874.559
seen the icelandic

2871.839 --> 2876.7999999999997
olympics or so whatever they call it

2874.559 --> 2880.3190000000004
your icelandic games

2876.8 --> 2880.319
now that's freaking weird

2881.839 --> 2885.359
was it was it icelandic

2885.52 --> 2888.24
i think it was

2894.0 --> 2900.8
they have some unusual

2897.04 --> 2903.68
sport games like way up north

2900.8 --> 2906.1600000000003
on average it's really bizarre and

2903.68 --> 2906.16
interesting

2908.0 --> 2915.92
antarctic games no

2914.24 --> 2917.68
the only game you're gonna play there is

2915.92 --> 2920.4
how long can you hold out

2917.68 --> 2921.359
doing anything before freezing to death

2920.4 --> 2929.839
so

2921.359 --> 2929.839
this is not much of a sport

2930.2 --> 2933.9199999999996
[Music]

2939.45 --> 2957.839
[Music]

2940.839 --> 2957.839
okay so heavy whatever

2971.44 --> 2985.839
okay well goody

2996.839 --> 2999.839
and

3001.52 --> 3003.7599999999998
right

3006.559 --> 3011.0400000000004
touch judo right

3011.44 --> 3015.92
can be interesting i just i don't seek

3013.92 --> 3018.319
out sports

3015.92 --> 3019.28
i just don't do that anymore but i've

3018.319 --> 3021.7599999999998
actually

3019.28 --> 3022.559
done a little bit of judo when i was a

3021.76 --> 3026.079
little kid

3022.559 --> 3027.6800000000003
didn't like it much though i've mostly

3026.079 --> 3029.599
done taekwondo

3027.68 --> 3032.16
now sometimes if i notice there's

3029.599 --> 3035.92
something special going on with that

3032.16 --> 3035.92
then i will watch just to see

3036.64 --> 3041.68
that yeah i also done a lot of tennis

3041.2 --> 3044.0789999999997
table

3041.68 --> 3045.359
when i was a kid i could probably still

3044.079 --> 3048.2400000000002
do it

3045.359 --> 3052.24
it's all about quickness and

3048.24 --> 3052.24
coordination and i'm very good at that

3053.68 --> 3057.359
i did yeah like i've even been able to

3056.64 --> 3060.96
like do those

3057.359 --> 3060.96
like quick aggressive

3061.119 --> 3065.2000000000003
it's just i don't hold out that long

3063.2 --> 3068.8799999999997
usually

3065.2 --> 3072.24
but i can do it i've beat some

3068.88 --> 3074.48
people that were like like yeah

3072.24 --> 3076.3999999999996
pro not professional but they were like

3074.48 --> 3083.44
really sports

3076.4 --> 3085.76
table tennisers and i held out for a few

3083.44 --> 3088.0
yeah and my reflexes are excellent

3085.76 --> 3090.7200000000003
always have been

3088.0 --> 3092.559
and i've trained them with my taekwondo

3090.72 --> 3097.839
a lot

3092.559 --> 3097.8390000000004
reflexes and balance

3100.49 --> 3103.5499999999997
[Music]

3111.92 --> 3116.8
but it's been a while though now i'm

3114.88 --> 3119.44
just working with the mind you know

3116.8 --> 3120.0
that's what i'm doing got a few levels

3119.44 --> 3122.839
of monk

3120.0 --> 3124.16
and now i'm just going straight towards

3122.839 --> 3128.72
the

3124.16 --> 3128.72
dual classing through paladin and wizard

3129.119 --> 3135.44
oh yeah only need a few pilot levels

3133.119 --> 3135.44
sorry

3137.359 --> 3143.5989999999997
boo that's pretty slow reflexes

3146.16 --> 3153.68
what you mean with taekwondo but it all

3149.2 --> 3157.1189999999997
depends what you're gonna do with it

3153.68 --> 3160.16
i i kind of broke with this i was

3157.119 --> 3162.6400000000003
very rebellious

3160.16 --> 3166.16
in taekwondo not aggressive but always

3162.64 --> 3169.68
trying to

3166.16 --> 3172.48
something that was unexpected and i

3169.68 --> 3174.48
literally like made moves that were not

3172.48 --> 3177.839
even registered

3174.48 --> 3180.96
like the double spin

3177.839 --> 3184.72
double k like or spin

3180.96 --> 3187.04
double kick spin around double kick

3184.72 --> 3187.9199999999996
it's like that's not even a move i could

3187.04 --> 3190.16
do it

3187.92 --> 3192.48
this is i even did it during an exam

3190.16 --> 3196.16
then they were like what

3192.48 --> 3196.16
like during a spar thing

3197.76 --> 3204.1600000000003
so i definitely got

3201.359 --> 3204.96
balance out of it for sure and a good

3204.16 --> 3206.8799999999997
knowledge of my

3204.96 --> 3209.2
body and that just helps a lot with

3206.88 --> 3211.44
reflexes

3209.2 --> 3212.48
and also makes you less afraid of

3211.44 --> 3215.52
physical

3212.48 --> 3218.48
pain because you know what does what

3215.52 --> 3220.559
i've been i've had a couple of light

3218.48 --> 3225.76
bruises

3220.559 --> 3225.76
but very light because i hate that

3226.96 --> 3230.64
and that's also why it became kind of

3229.359 --> 3233.52
prioritized just

3230.64 --> 3235.2
avoiding it first you do it with the

3233.52 --> 3237.839
diplomacy and then you do it with

3235.2 --> 3237.839
evasion

3239.119 --> 3244.559
or just running away really freaking

3242.079 --> 3244.559
quickly

3249.359 --> 3254.48
