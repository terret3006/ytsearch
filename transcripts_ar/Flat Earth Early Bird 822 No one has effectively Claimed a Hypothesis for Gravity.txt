i got green tea with me

180.0 --> 187.36
and i was almost going to be even later

183.44 --> 189.44
because i'm kind of hungry actually

187.36 --> 191.44000000000003
i didn't get up too late as i went to

189.44 --> 193.2
bed again early

191.44 --> 195.35999999999999
so this is a new thing i'm just going to

193.2 --> 198.319
bed around one o'clock these days

195.36 --> 201.36
between one and two and yeah that's

198.319 --> 201.35999999999999
working out just fine

201.92 --> 209.51899999999998
i am really feeling

205.84 --> 213.84
the sleep regenerating me so

209.519 --> 213.84
definitely gonna do that more often

222.48 --> 227.84
yesterday was a good day very active day

232.239 --> 236.64000000000001
a day where i completely forgot to make

234.799 --> 240.239
any kind of notes

236.64 --> 243.599
so see if you can

240.239 --> 243.59900000000002
back engineer all that

247.519 --> 252.31900000000002
yeah the flat earth debate yesterday was

249.36 --> 257.04
pretty good my show was pretty good too

252.319 --> 257.03999999999996
i thought pretty direct

258.239 --> 262.96
sleeping warrior had his channel nuked

261.12 --> 266.84000000000003
uh well apparently

262.96 --> 268.08
what his video had a copyright strike or

266.84 --> 270.96
something

268.08 --> 270.96
it's pretty weird

276.639 --> 282.96000000000004
well is it entirely gone

280.96 --> 285.68
because i did see the the video was

282.96 --> 285.68
removed but

289.12 --> 297.84000000000003
what the hell

302.0 --> 311.84
holy [ __ ]

315.84 --> 321.28
video just says

319.12 --> 325.84000000000003
video has been removed due to guidelines

321.28 --> 325.84
i can't really find his channel back

333.28 --> 339.84
hey nathan oakley

342.16 --> 344.47900000000004
right

345.84 --> 353.28
okay that's freaky i did he also

349.84 --> 356.88
he didn't say anything in skype so far

353.28 --> 356.88
at least did i miss it no

358.4 --> 370.4
so i wonder why

367.28 --> 370.4
maybe he'll pop up

371.759 --> 377.68
like i'm perfectly fine just getting him

375.199 --> 381.84000000000003
on the show right now through skype to

377.68 --> 381.84000000000003
basically see what's going on

386.16 --> 395.84000000000003
yeah that's pretty messed up i didn't

388.479 --> 395.84
realize that

406.84 --> 409.84
what

417.44 --> 423.84
yeah that was my homo erotics stalker

420.84 --> 423.84
again

442.08 --> 451.84
a random explorer yeah well i don't know

445.199 --> 451.84000000000003
i don't know what's happened no idea

461.12 --> 468.319
so yeah for starters everybody in chat

464.16 --> 471.12
if you like my show then

468.319 --> 473.68
please give it an up vote let's start

471.12 --> 473.68
out with that

474.8 --> 478.0
but uh yeah i'll see if i can maybe tr

477.52 --> 480.08
i'm just

478.0 --> 482.16
gonna try to skype call him hopefully

480.08 --> 485.12
you'll pick up

482.16 --> 485.12
let's see what happens

486.479 --> 493.84
uh if everything is correct you should

489.919 --> 493.84
be able to just hear him

503.879 --> 509.199
you know

506.8 --> 509.199
hello

510.879 --> 521.839
and so are you i i don't think i

514.8 --> 521.8389999999999
i'm not sure if it is registering

522.719 --> 526.0
yeah it's just that i didn't uh add an

525.36 --> 529.36
extra

526.0 --> 529.36
type of sound

530.08 --> 537.44
hold on maybe this

533.279 --> 548.24
no can anybody in chat and hear

537.44 --> 551.12
tony he is on with me on skype

548.24 --> 552.399
how about now well i can hear myself

551.12 --> 555.12
feeding back

552.399 --> 555.12
this is weird

558.72 --> 562.399
uh they it seems like the chat can't

561.44 --> 566.0
hear you

562.399 --> 568.64
unfortunately so i would have to

566.0 --> 568.64
work in

574.839 --> 577.839
yes

585.6 --> 589.839
yeah it seems that i forgot to do that

588.16 --> 594.3199999999999
i'm gonna try to do that

589.839 --> 594.32
right now hold on

595.92 --> 609.8389999999999
window capture should suffice

605.6 --> 609.839
let's see come on

615.2 --> 619.839
come on what is this

636.399 --> 639.68
okay let's try that again

643.12 --> 662.32
ah finally okay can you speak up again

659.92 --> 667.04
okay well sorry it's not gonna work out

662.32 --> 675.839
uh but yeah your channel got banned

667.04 --> 675.8389999999999
apparently what happened can you tell me

686.959 --> 691.8389999999999
the gravity bombs and it was only like a

690.399 --> 694.399
50-second video

691.839 --> 694.8800000000001
but somebody reported it and they took

694.399 --> 697.279
it down

694.88 --> 699.04
saying that it was um promoting

697.279 --> 703.04
dangerous acts

699.04 --> 703.04
and i was like so

721.92 --> 725.1999999999999
official narrative that got me in

723.44 --> 726.639
trouble and but

725.2 --> 728.1600000000001
eventually if they throw enough stop

726.639 --> 729.44
their mother will stick and eventually

728.16 --> 730.7199999999999
it'll come down but

729.44 --> 733.44
it doesn't really change anything

730.72 --> 734.9590000000001
because i wasn't really like

733.44 --> 736.24
it doesn't it's not going to stop

734.959 --> 736.8
anything that's happening it's just

736.24 --> 739.12
going to

736.8 --> 740.7199999999999
start again but it doesn't mean i've

739.12 --> 741.6
left it doesn't mean that they've won it

740.72 --> 743.12
doesn't mean

741.6 --> 746.5600000000001
it just means that youtube are

743.12 --> 749.839
supportive of extreme left-wingest

746.56 --> 751.92
censorship and this i'm proof of it so

749.839 --> 753.7600000000001
they can claim the victory wish the

751.92 --> 754.4799999999999
reality is it doesn't really change

753.76 --> 756.079
anything

754.48 --> 757.519
and i don't make any money from my

756.079 --> 759.519
channel i don't

757.519 --> 761.36
still got all my videos they can all be

759.519 --> 762.72
re-uploaded it's not going to take long

761.36 --> 764.72
to do them all but

762.72 --> 766.0
it just takes a little bit but

764.72 --> 767.6
eventually if you throw enough

766.0 --> 770.079
reports in and you know eventually

767.6 --> 773.44
they'll get something

770.079 --> 776.2399999999999
but what i don't understand is why

773.44 --> 777.839
why they didn't just like take down the

776.24 --> 779.519
video then

777.839 --> 781.36
why why would they then take down the

779.519 --> 782.9590000000001
whole thing i don't get it

781.36 --> 784.48
because i got i got two community

782.959 --> 786.7199999999999
strikes when it was to do with colbit

784.48 --> 788.48
stuff the human rights stuff and that's

786.72 --> 790.88
obviously anti-narrative

788.48 --> 791.519
and so i have two community strikes from

790.88 --> 793.4399999999999
that point

791.519 --> 794.72
and then eventually if they keep

793.44 --> 795.6800000000001
peppering it and keep pepper and keep

794.72 --> 798.5600000000001
prepping it they'll

795.68 --> 799.12
they'll win and but it's only a short

798.56 --> 800.3199999999999
term

799.12 --> 801.839
i mean they can claim the victory if

800.32 --> 804.0790000000001
they wish it won't change anything it's

801.839 --> 807.0400000000001
still but i've still got my videos so

804.079 --> 807.68
yeah i didn't want in the short term but

807.04 --> 811.04
it's just

807.68 --> 813.04
left being natured and youtube don't

811.04 --> 814.24
the end of the day the third strike was

813.04 --> 817.92
literally the

814.24 --> 819.12
the um the 50-second video was deemed by

817.92 --> 822.24
somebody to be

819.12 --> 823.92
um promoting dangerous acts

822.24 --> 825.36
and i'm like it's not really pronounced

823.92 --> 826.4799999999999
in danger so is it they've just been

825.36 --> 828.0
clicking it in the hope that they'll

826.48 --> 829.36
catch someone they're stuck

828.0 --> 831.12
and it seems to have stopped for the

829.36 --> 833.519
moment it's been appealed and

831.12 --> 835.279
i i'm hoping that it gets put back in

833.519 --> 836.8
place but

835.279 --> 838.48
what can you do when they when they

836.8 --> 840.7199999999999
lefties start complaining

838.48 --> 841.839
they need me show up it is that simple

840.72 --> 843.1990000000001
they don't want me talking about

841.839 --> 844.8800000000001
relative density they don't won't be

843.199 --> 847.8389999999999
talking about einsteinian gravity

844.88 --> 847.8389999999999
because that's their model

849.199 --> 852.7199999999999
states that yes accelerating upwards

850.959 --> 856.16
right that's what einstein

852.72 --> 857.519
gravitation like me telling is

856.16 --> 859.199
they're pointing that out because it's

857.519 --> 860.8
against their model so

859.199 --> 862.24
that's why they report every single

860.8 --> 863.68
video but

862.24 --> 865.12
you know it's not gonna change anything

863.68 --> 867.199
it's just gonna make a short term

865.12 --> 870.8
problem

867.199 --> 871.4399999999999
i don't know like because i talk about

870.8 --> 873.8389999999999
this stuff

871.44 --> 875.44
all the time as well and i've never had

873.839 --> 877.6800000000001
a single strike

875.44 --> 878.48
so i think they're yeah sure they're

877.68 --> 881.5999999999999
after you

878.48 --> 883.9200000000001
and after some are after me but

881.6 --> 886.0790000000001
i make sure that i literally have

883.92 --> 888.399
absolutely no angle

886.079 --> 890.56
of something to report through youtube

888.399 --> 892.32
by basically never really introducing

890.56 --> 895.04
anything except

892.32 --> 897.519
from people close to me that i know and

895.04 --> 900.639
i get direct permission from them right

897.519 --> 902.24
so i think they might have just kind of

900.639 --> 905.36
like been nitpicky

902.24 --> 905.76
and just yeah use the video to take you

905.36 --> 908.9590000000001
down

905.76 --> 911.12
technically let me just address dr gonzo

908.959 --> 913.279
crying warrior no no there's no tears

911.12 --> 916.079
here no tears at all it just

913.279 --> 917.68
reaffirms the position that is if you

916.079 --> 919.68
question the narrative

917.68 --> 921.76
people that are on that on the side

919.68 --> 924.2399999999999
pushing the narrative get offended

921.76 --> 927.8389999999999
they play the victim card and then

924.24 --> 927.839
because youtube

938.16 --> 941.8389999999999
all right i'll talk to you later

947.36 --> 949.759
all right

951.12 --> 955.68
so yeah he's probably just gonna start

953.519 --> 958.399
another channel and just start uploading

955.68 --> 962.079
videos again anyway

958.399 --> 964.16
but this is kind of like disappointing

962.079 --> 965.68
so i really have been enjoying his

964.16 --> 969.8389999999999
channel

965.68 --> 969.8389999999999
i put it in my favorites after all

984.399 --> 988.88
the reason is he violated the terms of

987.12 --> 991.839
service well yeah

988.88 --> 993.759
basically on a technicality it's like

991.839 --> 996.24
people complain

993.759 --> 997.04
but the complaining is not really the

996.24 --> 1001.04
reason

997.04 --> 1002.959
why people get taken down it's just that

1001.04 --> 1004.399
it is like an incentive for the

1002.959 --> 1007.4399999999999
moderators to start

1004.399 --> 1009.759
looking for technical reasons violation

1007.44 --> 1013.6800000000001
of the youtube service

1009.759 --> 1017.12
and then then if they find anything

1013.68 --> 1017.12
that's how they take it down

1018.72 --> 1025.839
ah look who's here

1030.959 --> 1039.8390000000002
you're praying for him capitaine

1034.88 --> 1039.8390000000002
tying sure

1040.559 --> 1044.24
i'll tell him if he calls back

1048.64 --> 1056.24
what did he supposedly do uh well

1053.12 --> 1059.6
in his last video he basically used some

1056.24 --> 1062.559
um practical joke

1059.6 --> 1063.6789999999999
thing that somebody didn't record it and

1062.559 --> 1067.28
use that as an

1063.679 --> 1070.0
analogy for

1067.28 --> 1071.6
for the situation typically happening in

1070.0 --> 1074.72
globe versus

1071.6 --> 1077.4399999999998
flat earth when telling a

1074.72 --> 1078.88
glober that gravity is not a force i

1077.44 --> 1081.76
don't know he just thought it was funny

1078.88 --> 1085.44
i thought it was funny too

1081.76 --> 1086.96
but apparently yeah that video was kind

1085.44 --> 1089.52
of on the edge

1086.96 --> 1092.8400000000001
it's like something that they can latch

1089.52 --> 1096.72
onto and get all disapproving

1092.84 --> 1099.9189999999999
so yeah i think that's

1096.72 --> 1099.919
what happened probably

1106.84 --> 1109.84
um

1120.72 --> 1126.64
i'm just kind of shocked about the level

1123.36 --> 1131.1999999999998
of petty behavior currently

1126.64 --> 1133.6000000000001
like like censorship is a win

1131.2 --> 1135.52
that's the sense that i'm getting from

1133.6 --> 1138.559
some people in chats very

1135.52 --> 1138.559
very disappointing

1143.28 --> 1148.0
like maybe against better judgment i

1146.32 --> 1149.6
thought that at least some of you were

1148.0 --> 1165.84
better than that

1149.6 --> 1165.84
yes i was mistaken

1171.84 --> 1174.08
what

1175.36 --> 1180.32
did you made what are you blabbering

1177.679 --> 1180.3200000000002
about dude

1181.12 --> 1185.1999999999998
dude mellow fellow what is your issue

1190.84 --> 1193.84
here

1199.36 --> 1207.84
hey judy of heaven good to see you

1218.0 --> 1225.12
okay well on buchanan i i do appreciate

1221.919 --> 1228.0800000000002
that the compliment in the sentiment but

1225.12 --> 1229.36
personally i do kind of enjoy the other

1228.08 --> 1233.039
channels

1229.36 --> 1236.24
you know like these people

1233.039 --> 1236.24
are my friends

1236.96 --> 1242.559
and there's a lot of in jokes going on

1240.48 --> 1243.76
you know i hang around with sleeping

1242.559 --> 1246.6399999999999
warrior

1243.76 --> 1248.64
and adam meekin and chocolate saiyan

1246.64 --> 1251.2800000000002
sometimes 10th man

1248.64 --> 1252.72
after the recording is over for like

1251.28 --> 1254.32
hours sometimes

1252.72 --> 1256.159
all kinds of conversation so they're

1254.32 --> 1257.2
kind of my friends and there's just a

1256.159 --> 1259.7600000000002
lot of in jokes

1257.2 --> 1260.8400000000001
like we we do make a lot of jokes about

1259.76 --> 1265.039
ballers

1260.84 --> 1265.36
okay and sometimes take it to the level

1265.039 --> 1268.559
that

1265.36 --> 1269.039
yeah it's not very sensible to put that

1268.559 --> 1272.24
out

1269.039 --> 1274.84
and sometimes yeah

1272.24 --> 1278.88
tony sleeping warrior gets into a jokey

1274.84 --> 1282.559
mood and he kind of wants to poke at him

1278.88 --> 1282.5590000000002
then he does that with these videos

1288.159 --> 1292.88
but yeah he's just an uploader that's

1290.48 --> 1295.1200000000001
how he does things

1292.88 --> 1296.48
i have another project of course the

1295.12 --> 1299.6789999999999
flat earth early bird show

1296.48 --> 1303.2
live and the interactions and answering

1299.679 --> 1306.4
the questions and being open for inquiry

1303.2 --> 1308.72
and that's different setup so

1306.4 --> 1310.159
it's not really fair to compare it you

1308.72 --> 1312.17
know but

1310.159 --> 1314.0800000000002
tony's insight and work and

1312.17 --> 1316.159
[Music]

1314.08 --> 1318.32
just overall contribution on the flat

1316.159 --> 1321.2
earth scene and in the flat earth debate

1318.32 --> 1322.3999999999999
has been like really supporting to my

1321.2 --> 1325.6000000000001
efforts

1322.4 --> 1327.44
and to progressing my understanding of

1325.6 --> 1330.1589999999999
the mechanics of it all

1327.44 --> 1331.1200000000001
it's pretty much him that's gotten me to

1330.159 --> 1333.1200000000001
the point that i

1331.12 --> 1334.799
started to figure out relative density

1333.12 --> 1338.2399999999998
is really

1334.799 --> 1343.36
the foundation instead of gravity

1338.24 --> 1343.36
that was not easy to start to see that

1344.84 --> 1347.84
right

1352.0 --> 1357.28
yeah indifference the entire world knows

1355.12 --> 1361.12
that

1357.28 --> 1364.32
because you guys rarely hold back

1361.12 --> 1364.32
seem to have no shame

1366.24 --> 1369.1200000000001
that's your problem

1371.6 --> 1378.799
that acceleration deceleration is a form

1375.039 --> 1381.919
of acceleration the opposite form

1378.799 --> 1384.72
no no it's not

1381.919 --> 1386.24
no acceleration and deceleration are not

1384.72 --> 1388.96
the same thing

1386.24 --> 1391.039
but you could mathematically equivocate

1388.96 --> 1394.32
them

1391.039 --> 1397.919
because there's the same type of

1394.32 --> 1399.84
alteration mechanically it's just it's a

1397.919 --> 1403.2
similar type of alteration

1399.84 --> 1405.84
though when you define it physically

1403.2 --> 1408.159
it's not the same thing deceleration is

1405.84 --> 1410.799
not a form of acceleration

1408.159 --> 1410.7990000000002
not really

1414.32 --> 1419.2
but you could think of it as such and

1417.12 --> 1422.559
equate it mathematically

1419.2 --> 1422.559
but they are not the same

1428.559 --> 1432.1589999999999
yeah so when you say it's a form of

1430.72 --> 1435.2
acceleration

1432.159 --> 1437.2
you're not being literal

1435.2 --> 1438.72
you're basically placing it into the

1437.2 --> 1442.88
field of mechanics

1438.72 --> 1446.559
and math so it is an equivocation

1442.88 --> 1448.4
it's not literal right so i was correct

1446.559 --> 1450.8799999999999
and i don't know why you keep harping on

1448.4 --> 1452.0
about this like i was incorrect i'm not

1450.88 --> 1455.44
incorrect

1452.0 --> 1459.84
just being extremely specific

1455.44 --> 1459.8400000000001
pedantic if you will

1460.72 --> 1473.84
and now that opposite form all that it's

1463.919 --> 1473.8400000000001
not the same thing

1479.52 --> 1483.679
right the deceleration just isn't an

1482.32 --> 1486.0
acceleration

1483.679 --> 1488.72
it's a deceleration that's why it has a

1486.0 --> 1492.159
separate word

1488.72 --> 1495.2
that signifies the opposite so

1492.159 --> 1496.3200000000002
i don't know why you got so caught up on

1495.2 --> 1501.8400000000001
this

1496.32 --> 1501.84
it's kind of a waste of my time

1509.36 --> 1513.52
now i laid down exactly the train of

1512.96 --> 1516.64
thought

1513.52 --> 1516.6399999999999
where it's coming from

1518.72 --> 1525.039
why i say it's not the same thing

1522.32 --> 1525.36
just in a different field you could put

1525.039 --> 1528.1589999999999
them

1525.36 --> 1530.32
in a similar basket due to the effect

1528.159 --> 1534.64
the mechanical effect

1530.32 --> 1537.9189999999999
but practically just in the real world

1534.64 --> 1540.96
it's not the same thing

1537.919 --> 1540.96
that's all i've said

1541.2 --> 1547.2
in form of a form of okay mellow fellow

1544.24 --> 1549.6
well look if you're not gonna drop this

1547.2 --> 1551.919
[ __ ] because i have addressed you

1549.6 --> 1553.4399999999998
right i have and i explained it i've

1551.919 --> 1554.96
done it a couple of times if you're not

1553.44 --> 1557.039
gonna stop

1554.96 --> 1558.88
i'm just gonna ban you because you're

1557.039 --> 1561.279
not a mellow fellow anymore

1558.88 --> 1562.7990000000002
you're being a whiny [ __ ] and you're

1561.279 --> 1565.12
being pedantic

1562.799 --> 1565.84
nitpicky over something that is

1565.12 --> 1571.84
literally

1565.84 --> 1571.84
completely irrelevant to anything

1572.24 --> 1577.679
you know your caps is not helping either

1575.44 --> 1580.0
because i heard you everybody's hurt you

1577.679 --> 1581.919
yeah

1580.0 --> 1584.4
so i don't know why you're so upset

1581.919 --> 1586.3200000000002
about this thing

1584.4 --> 1599.8400000000001
and if you're not gonna drop it i will

1586.32 --> 1599.84
ban you

1609.36 --> 1612.6399999999999
well for any misunderstanding you might

1612.08 --> 1616.3999999999999
have had

1612.64 --> 1619.44
about my explanation i've already

1616.4 --> 1621.52
clarified that yeah

1619.44 --> 1623.52
i've already clarified exactly what i

1621.52 --> 1626.8799999999999
mean several times

1623.52 --> 1629.84
so that you get caught up

1626.88 --> 1631.7600000000002
on your interpretation of what i might

1629.84 --> 1635.039
have originally said

1631.76 --> 1638.08
i've already elaborated and

1635.039 --> 1640.8799999999999
cleared up details about what i meant

1638.08 --> 1643.9189999999999
i have not made a mistake you simply

1640.88 --> 1643.919
didn't understand

1679.84 --> 1683.84
right nathan

1697.36 --> 1704.7199999999998
no no in the in the real world

1701.36 --> 1709.12
in the physical literal world where

1704.72 --> 1712.159
things have names acceleration

1709.12 --> 1714.1589999999999
is not deceleration and deceleration is

1712.159 --> 1717.7600000000002
not acceleration they are separately

1714.159 --> 1719.2
named for a reason because they are not

1717.76 --> 1720.24
the same thing but yeah if you're going

1719.2 --> 1722.64
to

1720.24 --> 1723.279
draw the patterns and overlay them oh

1722.64 --> 1727.3600000000001
yeah you

1723.279 --> 1730.0
could you could if you want through math

1727.36 --> 1731.4399999999998
say that deceleration is a form of

1730.0 --> 1734.559
acceleration

1731.44 --> 1735.3600000000001
right mathematically describing it all

1734.559 --> 1738.399
those things

1735.36 --> 1740.799
comparing it the patterns right but in

1738.399 --> 1745.4399999999998
the real world

1740.799 --> 1749.36
it's not the same thing

1745.44 --> 1752.3990000000001
yeah and i'm kind of done

1749.36 --> 1755.1999999999998
elaborating this [ __ ] i don't

1752.399 --> 1757.6789999999999
know why you keep hammering on this

1755.2 --> 1757.679
nonsense

1758.0 --> 1763.84
i don't care what

1761.2 --> 1766.0
you think i am implying that you're

1763.84 --> 1768.559
saying i'm explaining it right now

1766.0 --> 1771.279
right you're putting [ __ ] in my shoes

1768.559 --> 1773.84
about what i've supposedly done wrong

1771.279 --> 1774.88
whining about what i've supposedly said

1773.84 --> 1777.9189999999999
that you said

1774.88 --> 1779.8400000000001
i'm just saying exactly how i see it

1777.919 --> 1781.279
to elaborate to get any

1779.84 --> 1784.0
misunderstandings

1781.279 --> 1784.64
out of the way and i don't give a [ __ ]

1784.0 --> 1787.84
what you

1784.64 --> 1789.1200000000001
said mellow fellow i don't care what you

1787.84 --> 1791.6
said

1789.12 --> 1793.36
and i don't care even how i responded to

1791.6 --> 1796.8799999999999
that

1793.36 --> 1796.8799999999999
my position is clear

1798.48 --> 1809.84
stop whining

1831.76 --> 1837.679
it can be a form now

1834.96 --> 1839.679
yeah not a form as in you could

1837.679 --> 1841.2
equificate it you could compare it

1839.679 --> 1844.799
mathematically yeah

1841.2 --> 1846.96
oh a form of well not in the physical

1844.799 --> 1849.039
literal world though

1846.96 --> 1851.1200000000001
acceleration is acceleration and

1849.039 --> 1853.52
deceleration is deceleration

1851.12 --> 1854.2399999999998
but yeah they definitely have matching

1853.52 --> 1857.76
patterns

1854.24 --> 1860.64
in certain ways i know doesn't make them

1857.76 --> 1860.64
the same thing though

1862.84 --> 1865.84
huh

1876.84 --> 1879.84
good

1891.2 --> 1893.8400000000001
hmm

1896.96 --> 1900.64
all right yeah foul and volcanic sure

1899.76 --> 1907.84
sometime

1900.64 --> 1907.8400000000001
i i don't know if right now

1908.96 --> 1914.559
so i'm a relatively distracted tension

1912.159 --> 1917.1200000000001
seemed to be high

1914.559 --> 1919.6789999999999
and it was already high with me a little

1917.12 --> 1935.84
even though i'm fairly under control

1919.679 --> 1935.8400000000001
before i started the show

1938.96 --> 1942.88
but yeah at some point i would

1940.799 --> 1946.84
definitely like to continue that

1942.88 --> 1949.8400000000001
conversation fabulous that would be

1946.84 --> 1949.84
great

1964.559 --> 1971.6
it's a mellow fellow again i'm

1967.919 --> 1974.0
not i don't care what you said

1971.6 --> 1976.1589999999999
you know where it came from where it

1974.0 --> 1980.0
came from right was from the situation

1976.159 --> 1982.72
at a flat earth debate with rumpus

1980.0 --> 1983.679
who did say that right so that's the

1982.72 --> 1986.72
starting point

1983.679 --> 1987.279
like i don't know if you realize but i

1986.72 --> 1989.84
don't think

1987.279 --> 1990.32
anybody really cares what you said in

1989.84 --> 1993.76
chat

1990.32 --> 1997.519
at some time right because the argument

1993.76 --> 1997.519
isn't about what you said

1998.72 --> 2003.519
it's about what was being said what

2001.679 --> 2005.8400000000001
rampa said

2003.519 --> 2005.84
right

2012.799 --> 2016.799
so when i'm addressing it in general i'm

2016.08 --> 2018.96
using

2016.799 --> 2020.0
the conversation between nathan and

2018.96 --> 2022.64
rompus

2020.0 --> 2024.24
as a vantage point because rumpus did

2022.64 --> 2029.6000000000001
claim they were the same thing

2024.24 --> 2029.6
persistently he was quite literal

2030.48 --> 2034.159
he didn't care to explain it the way

2033.2 --> 2037.799
that i have

2034.159 --> 2040.3200000000002
to yeah make it clear that there's a

2037.799 --> 2043.679
differentiation between

2040.32 --> 2047.84
mathematical extractions

2043.679 --> 2047.8400000000001
and literal reality

2065.28 --> 2070.7200000000003
yes foul and buchanan okay looking

2068.0 --> 2070.72
forward to it

2073.76 --> 2076.96
like it would be good too if you would

2075.919 --> 2080.24
uh

2076.96 --> 2080.2400000000002
contact me on skype

2080.56 --> 2083.679
so skype address is like the first line

2082.879 --> 2086.48
in the

2083.679 --> 2089.04
description box of the youtube video it

2086.48 --> 2092.8
would be good to have you there

2089.04 --> 2092.8
it's much easier also to

2093.44 --> 2097.52
communicate outside of the show of

2095.2 --> 2097.52
course

2098.0 --> 2103.839
i think that i'm gonna give you a wrench

2100.64 --> 2103.839
for now

2120.24 --> 2123.68
acceleration deceleration has to do with

2122.56 --> 2125.44
relativity

2123.68 --> 2127.2
point of view right so that's

2125.44 --> 2130.8
immediately into the

2127.2 --> 2133.1189999999997
conceptual realm that was my point

2130.8 --> 2135.04
within mathematics and hey that's

2133.119 --> 2135.839
exactly the field of the relativity

2135.04 --> 2138.4
theory

2135.839 --> 2138.96
theory as in colloquial theory no actual

2138.4 --> 2142.2400000000002
proof

2138.96 --> 2144.0
it's just a conception yeah

2142.24 --> 2146.0
in that sense it's like oh yeah

2144.0 --> 2146.56
deceleration acceleration doesn't really

2146.0 --> 2150.0
matter

2146.56 --> 2152.64
right in that way of thinking

2150.0 --> 2154.64
which is not physical reality it's just

2152.64 --> 2157.1189999999997
a conception it's another way of looking

2154.64 --> 2157.1189999999997
at things

2157.2 --> 2173.839
more mathematical

2184.24 --> 2188.3199999999997
it's still forming the same thing oh

2186.72 --> 2193.1189999999997
yeah you can think of it if

2188.32 --> 2200.079
if you want to live in relativity world

2193.119 --> 2202.96
then sure sure it's the same thing

2200.079 --> 2203.44
stopping you thinking about it as such

2202.96 --> 2205.599
because

2203.44 --> 2207.599
there's no point to that if you want to

2205.599 --> 2215.839
think about it as such you're going to

2207.599 --> 2215.839
do it anyway

2232.16 --> 2240.96
chris what's new

2236.72 --> 2243.839
well tony's channel got taken down

2240.96 --> 2243.839
that's new

2250.24 --> 2258.3999999999996
the uh the gti website has

2254.72 --> 2258.3999999999996
engaged in the reboot

2264.48 --> 2271.839
so it's very exciting bit nervous about

2268.839 --> 2271.839
that

2278.32 --> 2285.839
right uh and yeah i did do quite

2282.079 --> 2285.8390000000004
a few things i think

2286.32 --> 2290.7200000000003
just a whole bunch of videos here and

2288.4 --> 2290.7200000000003
there

2294.96 --> 2299.04
oh yeah of course kiwi live it was qe

2298.079 --> 2300.8
live and i was

2299.04 --> 2303.119
part of that although i was a little

2300.8 --> 2303.119
late

2307.28 --> 2310.8
more about the scientific method

2310.88 --> 2315.6800000000003
oh yeah and afterward i had a decent

2313.52 --> 2318.72
conversation with some people

2315.68 --> 2319.9199999999996
a new guy what was his name again who

2318.72 --> 2322.16
was hanging around in the

2319.92 --> 2323.76
just in discord and he was very

2322.16 --> 2326.16
interested in

2323.76 --> 2326.96
he was basically we were left the two of

2326.16 --> 2329.1189999999997
us and

2326.96 --> 2330.56
he kind of like started asking questions

2329.119 --> 2333.92
and i

2330.56 --> 2336.48
rolled out a lot of my background

2333.92 --> 2337.119
like a rough summaration of my channel

2336.48 --> 2340.079
even like

2337.119 --> 2342.56
i've had visions and stuff and trying to

2340.079 --> 2344.96
put it quickly all together

2342.56 --> 2347.119
and he was interested and he said he

2344.96 --> 2350.4
subscribed

2347.119 --> 2353.52
so i don't know he might be here

2350.4 --> 2356.1600000000003
but i don't recognize the name if he is

2353.52 --> 2356.8
here but it might also be a little bit

2356.16 --> 2359.7599999999998
too

2356.8 --> 2359.76
early for him

2361.68 --> 2366.64
so that happened oh yeah that was

2364.64 --> 2369.0499999999997
baldur's gate 3 update

2366.64 --> 2370.72
now there's a druid character possible

2369.05 --> 2372.5600000000004
[Music]

2370.72 --> 2376.8799999999997
i haven't really played it elaborately

2372.56 --> 2376.88
but it's yeah this is kind of cute

2377.28 --> 2381.6800000000003
druids are very cool in d d always have

2380.0 --> 2384.88
been

2381.68 --> 2384.8799999999997
because of the shape shifting

2394.839 --> 2397.839
right

2398.48 --> 2411.04
yeah that was pretty much it some

2401.76 --> 2414.8
yeah also watching infowars some of that

2411.04 --> 2415.92
aaron brown hello i haven't played

2414.8 --> 2418.96
baldur's game since

2415.92 --> 2421.839
the first one oh you missed out man

2418.96 --> 2424.2400000000002
dude if you liked baldisgate one like if

2421.839 --> 2427.7599999999998
you actually like the way it felt

2424.24 --> 2430.4799999999996
progressed all that and how the game is

2427.76 --> 2432.079
you should absolutely try out the second

2430.48 --> 2435.68
one

2432.079 --> 2435.6800000000003
it's really heavy stuff

2437.359 --> 2441.52
it works really well together just bald

2440.56 --> 2444.319
skate one

2441.52 --> 2445.359
with the extension and voltage gate 2

2444.319 --> 2448.8
with the

2445.359 --> 2453.839
rounding out extension it's just the

2448.8 --> 2453.8390000000004
whole package is really awesome

2454.64 --> 2457.7599999999998
uh but yeah i was talking about baldur's

2456.96 --> 2461.68
gate 3

2457.76 --> 2463.8390000000004
which is like a completely new interface

2461.68 --> 2465.5989999999997
and that's been happening for a while

2463.839 --> 2468.0789999999997
although there seems to be some

2465.599 --> 2470.7200000000003
production delay apparently going on

2468.079 --> 2474.1600000000003
i've read into that a little

2470.72 --> 2474.16
people complaining about that

2476.079 --> 2481.44
because it's like i already bought the

2477.92 --> 2484.8
game last year

2481.44 --> 2485.839
in october or something but it's still

2484.8 --> 2488.0
in

2485.839 --> 2489.2799999999997
it's still not finished that's just the

2488.0 --> 2492.64
first

2489.28 --> 2495.8390000000004
region big slab or region

2492.64 --> 2495.839
and that's it

2496.319 --> 2509.839
and there should be a lot more but

2498.4 --> 2509.839
apparently there's production delay so

2510.56 --> 2514.0789999999997
let's see what you guys are talking

2520.839 --> 2523.839
about

2543.28 --> 2545.599
right

2547.04 --> 2551.359
it really seems that before this show

2550.16 --> 2553.52
started nobody's

2551.359 --> 2555.68
taking notice of it it's only now

2553.52 --> 2558.88
sinking into the

2555.68 --> 2558.8799999999997
skype chats here

2559.359 --> 2565.839
the tony's channel got banned

2591.68 --> 2593.839
what

2609.44 --> 2612.4
hey samson

2614.72 --> 2621.839
good to see you live in the chat

2643.52 --> 2650.64
is it going what

2648.96 --> 2652.96
all right how's it going yeah i'm doing

2650.64 --> 2652.96
okay

2658.079 --> 2660.6400000000003
it's a little

2661.119 --> 2667.119
chilly now so

2664.16 --> 2677.839
yeah starting to regret just taking off

2667.119 --> 2677.839
my sweater

2692.4 --> 2694.7200000000003
what

2695.92 --> 2701.359
oh i didn't know

2699.359 --> 2705.839
sorry i completely missed out on that

2701.359 --> 2705.839
julio pavin

2707.28 --> 2710.3190000000004
i'll check it right now

2711.44 --> 2719.839
ah thank you very much

2720.96 --> 2725.04
this is good it's been a while what

2725.28 --> 2727.52
oh

2730.839 --> 2733.839
right

2746.64 --> 2750.72
like seriously it's been it's been over

2748.88 --> 2754.4
a week

2750.72 --> 2756.9599999999996
since the previous donation of anyone

2754.4 --> 2756.96
but yeah

2758.56 --> 2762.48
might be because i've been so talking

2761.92 --> 2764.8
about

2762.48 --> 2765.68
like this potential financial thing

2764.8 --> 2769.76
going better

2765.68 --> 2771.68
but it's still not there though you know

2769.76 --> 2775.8390000000004
i still do need support so thank you

2771.68 --> 2775.839
very much julia pembin

2778.48 --> 2783.2
ah so it's all melted good to hear

2786.839 --> 2789.839
samson

2800.839 --> 2803.839
okay

2816.88 --> 2820.2400000000002
yeah i know rufus and hubbins i do try

2819.599 --> 2823.76
to be

2820.24 --> 2827.839
exactly on time it's just that

2823.76 --> 2827.8390000000004
sometimes it just doesn't really work

2828.839 --> 2834.88
out

2831.28 --> 2834.88
but i've been like on time

2835.2 --> 2839.1189999999997
pretty well in the recent days like it's

2837.44 --> 2841.119
been worse

2839.119 --> 2844.079
i've had periods where i was late a lot

2841.119 --> 2847.76
of the times

2844.079 --> 2849.44
but yeah that you know i can't really

2847.76 --> 2851.6800000000003
help it

2849.44 --> 2852.7200000000003
if i'm gonna be late or if i suddenly

2851.68 --> 2854.64
feel just

2852.72 --> 2855.9199999999996
not really good and i have to do

2854.64 --> 2858.319
something about it

2855.92 --> 2859.04
before i can start and that's just the

2858.319 --> 2862.079
way it is

2859.04 --> 2865.7599999999998
you know better late than

2862.079 --> 2868.1600000000003
like forced on stage in a bad

2865.76 --> 2870.48
mood or something you know not feeling

2868.16 --> 2870.48
good

2871.04 --> 2875.04
like in a way i have to like kind of

2874.0 --> 2878.559
zone into

2875.04 --> 2880.96
doing the show that requires some time

2878.559 --> 2883.76
to focus

2880.96 --> 2885.44
i it's not for me like oh yeah a lot of

2883.76 --> 2888.079
doing this doing that and then

2885.44 --> 2890.079
just click just go live just like that

2888.079 --> 2893.92
no no it

2890.079 --> 2897.599
requires me to really basically imagine

2893.92 --> 2897.599
like i am going to do the show

2898.559 --> 2902.96
what kind of feelings can i be expecting

2901.44 --> 2906.079
should i be preparing for

2902.96 --> 2909.68
all that right

2906.079 --> 2910.7200000000003
so yeah unfortunately sometimes that

2909.68 --> 2913.9199999999996
means i get late

2910.72 --> 2914.7999999999997
i yeah i show up late especially today

2913.92 --> 2918.559
when

2914.8 --> 2920.2400000000002
like groceries all went kind of wrong

2918.559 --> 2922.2400000000002
like i went all the way over there and

2920.24 --> 2925.2
then suddenly i didn't have enough money

2922.24 --> 2929.2799999999997
then i got back i worked out something

2925.2 --> 2932.16
with my dad

2929.28 --> 2934.7200000000003
and then i had yeah i was like i just

2932.16 --> 2934.72
went back

2937.44 --> 2941.2000000000003
but oh yeah that's not something that

2939.359 --> 2943.68
normally happens and because of that

2941.2 --> 2945.52
yeah it just took just this little bit

2943.68 --> 2946.319
amount too much time and i need to kind

2945.52 --> 2948.48
of cool off

2946.319 --> 2950.88
afterward too because i i didn't really

2948.48 --> 2950.88
hurry

2950.96 --> 2955.92
then i had to cool down again so anyway

2954.0 --> 2957.76
that's just the reason i'm late sorry

2955.92 --> 2960.8
about that can't

2957.76 --> 2965.8390000000004
really do anything about it

2960.8 --> 2965.8390000000004
except just try to have that not happen

2966.8 --> 2971.8390000000004
no guarantees

2984.0 --> 2999.839
fashionably late well it's not really a

2988.0 --> 2999.839
party though

3002.16 --> 3006.0789999999997
all right oh yeah i remember that like

3005.2 --> 3009.839
david ike

3006.079 --> 3013.6800000000003
got on with alex jones

3009.839 --> 3016.5589999999997
yesterday oh like for a long time

3013.68 --> 3018.48
a pretty long interview it was kind of

3016.559 --> 3021.3590000000004
interesting to hear that back and to see

3018.48 --> 3021.359
like how he's

3021.599 --> 3027.839
like focused refocused

3028.8 --> 3041.8390000000004
so that was kind of interesting tuning

3030.559 --> 3041.8390000000004
into that

3073.04 --> 3080.8
commitment organization preparation well

3076.48 --> 3080.8
preparation yeah

3080.88 --> 3085.359
now look it's not that much of a hassle

3093.92 --> 3098.88
but yes afterwards i definitely do

3097.04 --> 3100.16
need some relaxed time but at the same

3098.88 --> 3102.7200000000003
time you know

3100.16 --> 3104.7999999999997
being on the flat earth early bird show

3102.72 --> 3107.52
is very different from being on

3104.8 --> 3108.2400000000002
the flat earth debate show and in a way

3107.52 --> 3110.88
i

3108.24 --> 3112.3999999999996
like i can't take a cup like a gear

3110.88 --> 3114.96
switch back

3112.4 --> 3116.64
when i get on there because i'm not the

3114.96 --> 3119.04
show host

3116.64 --> 3120.48
i'm not constantly on camera so i can

3119.04 --> 3123.2
literally just

3120.48 --> 3124.559
take a break very easily don't have to

3123.2 --> 3126.8799999999997
be

3124.559 --> 3130.88
strained about the constant attention as

3126.88 --> 3130.88
much it's much more easy for me

3133.04 --> 3136.96
and again if i'm very passionate about

3135.44 --> 3140.64
something then i can just

3136.96 --> 3143.2
try to dive in and then i'm very active

3140.64 --> 3152.96
but i don't have to be necessarily

3143.2 --> 3154.96
because i'm not running the show

3152.96 --> 3156.96
but yeah getting to the point of just

3154.96 --> 3160.48
like yeah i am doing a show it's

3156.96 --> 3160.48
something that's on the long run

3160.559 --> 3165.44
there's all kinds of people watching

3162.8 --> 3170.0
including people that

3165.44 --> 3170.0
that basically want to get rid of me

3170.16 --> 3175.2
right even people that i don't know who

3172.72 --> 3175.2
they are

3175.839 --> 3179.599
i know this so i'm just taking it very

3178.559 --> 3183.44
seriously

3179.599 --> 3185.92
not goofing around really i try to be

3183.44 --> 3186.64
personal and still have fun and still be

3185.92 --> 3189.839
human

3186.64 --> 3192.64
but at the same time i know i'm not just

3189.839 --> 3193.04
like oh i'm free i could do whatever i

3192.64 --> 3195.1189999999997
want

3193.04 --> 3196.8
there's no danger yeah there is freaking

3195.119 --> 3201.2000000000003
danger constantly

3196.8 --> 3204.7200000000003
and being myself is almost like a luxury

3201.2 --> 3204.72
but a necessary luxury

3204.88 --> 3210.6400000000003
because it's a part what i do

3208.88 --> 3212.319
and i have to defend it against the

3210.64 --> 3213.1189999999997
world that's constantly trying to

3212.319 --> 3218.079
diffuse

3213.119 --> 3220.6400000000003
what you do make you force yourself to

3218.079 --> 3224.2400000000002
to give up something constantly

3220.64 --> 3224.24
constantly constantly

3227.68 --> 3235.839
how many accounts do you reckon are

3230.8 --> 3239.92
your on my blog list right now

3235.839 --> 3239.92
should be about 10 people

3241.599 --> 3251.839
alright pill true

3254.48 --> 3262.319
well dr gonzo i personally believe

3258.559 --> 3265.92
i don't get paid enough money to even

3262.319 --> 3268.8
consider ever doing such a setup

3265.92 --> 3268.8
thank you very much

3270.16 --> 3276.48
maybe for a few hundred thousand a day

3273.359 --> 3279.359
you know but other than that no

3276.48 --> 3282.2400000000002
i'd like to have some level of peace and

3279.359 --> 3282.24
quiet in my life

3290.839 --> 3293.839
thanks

3308.799 --> 3321.839
hold on

3365.44 --> 3370.0
yeah dr gonzo that's that's a really

3367.839 --> 3374.0
cute idea

3370.0 --> 3377.839
but i don't have the energy

3374.0 --> 3381.839
or just like there's no there's no way

3377.839 --> 3385.04
i can do that not in this position

3381.839 --> 3387.52
right now maybe in the future who knows

3385.04 --> 3389.359
what i could eventually choose to try

3387.52 --> 3393.839
out to do

3389.359 --> 3397.119
if i'm in a more self-sufficient setup

3393.839 --> 3400.72
where i don't have people in my hair or

3397.119 --> 3401.04
constantly have to watch however loud i

3400.72 --> 3404.0
get

3401.04 --> 3406.319
or all of that you know when i got more

3404.0 --> 3409.119
actual freedom to completely do it

3406.319 --> 3411.839
however i like then who knows what i

3409.119 --> 3411.839
could try out

3413.68 --> 3433.839
do i wear boots yeah i do

3417.04 --> 3433.839
sure i did boots there we go boots

3459.04 --> 3466.64
i hope you set up an only fancy what

3462.96 --> 3466.64
dr gonzo dude

3469.52 --> 3475.839
you're weird

3483.2 --> 3486.24
look not right now i appreciate if

3485.119 --> 3487.92
that's real

3486.24 --> 3490.319
and you're not just fooling around with

3487.92 --> 3493.839
me or trying to get some in

3490.319 --> 3495.04
some hook in me right then i do

3493.839 --> 3498.5589999999997
appreciate it but

3495.04 --> 3498.5589999999997
just now is not the time

3500.559 --> 3504.799
come back come back to me in the future

3503.359 --> 3517.839
or maybe i'll come back

3504.799 --> 3517.839
to you about it if you're still around

3518.16 --> 3524.16
i think it's for me to write a book

3520.96 --> 3524.16
nathan yamaha

3528.839 --> 3531.839
um

3536.64 --> 3539.7599999999998
all right fellain

3541.76 --> 3546.4
paratrooper woods okay well these are

3543.76 --> 3546.7990000000004
not like a real military issue but they

3546.4 --> 3552.0
are

3546.799 --> 3554.4
basically modeled after it sort of

3552.0 --> 3555.76
they used to have very thick soles now

3554.4 --> 3557.52
that's kind of worn down but i've

3555.76 --> 3561.3590000000004
wearing these boots forever

3557.52 --> 3561.359
and i keep repairing them as well

3564.319 --> 3568.48
and yeah i love these types i've been

3566.48 --> 3572.799
wearing these types of shoes

3568.48 --> 3578.559
boots whatever you want to call them for

3572.799 --> 3578.559
wow yeah for 20 years

3578.799 --> 3583.7599999999998
it was quite a hassle to wear them at

3580.88 --> 3588.6400000000003
first they kind of hurt my feet

3583.76 --> 3588.6400000000003
because yeah just the way they are

3591.839 --> 3598.0
but now it's just second nature and i

3594.48 --> 3598.0
really love these types of boots

3598.16 --> 3604.0
they look like dr martin's no they

3600.88 --> 3607.44
aren't dr martin's but

3604.0 --> 3607.44
they are kind of similar

3611.359 --> 3615.839
great for stopping the devil what

3616.559 --> 3619.92
stomping oh okay

3625.2 --> 3631.68
well i'm not going to yeah

3628.4 --> 3633.52
get into that but safe to say there's

3631.68 --> 3636.24
all kinds of benefits of having these

3633.52 --> 3636.24
types of boots

3641.52 --> 3644.88
would you accept second

3645.68 --> 3652.799
the [ __ ] no i'm i'm not gonna

3649.839 --> 3653.44
i'm not gonna take your uh your covet

3652.799 --> 3656.96
laced

3653.44 --> 3660.799
blankets clothing

3656.96 --> 3660.799
thank you very much red pill trill

3662.4 --> 3667.839
and my t-shirt is just fine this t-shirt

3665.44 --> 3671.839
is not even half a year old

3667.839 --> 3671.839
it's great

3680.96 --> 3685.839
that was a joke dude

3711.92 --> 3717.6800000000003
uh well roof and saint hubbins

3714.96 --> 3719.44
the sun and moon five years ago it's

3717.68 --> 3722.24
more like four years ago

3719.44 --> 3723.44
but yes i used to be part of that group

3722.24 --> 3725.5989999999997
for a time

3723.44 --> 3727.039
and they were the first channel that i

3725.599 --> 3730.6400000000003
even found

3727.039 --> 3733.6800000000003
that just talked about it

3730.64 --> 3735.44
like the very first that ever had

3733.68 --> 3737.359
discussions about it

3735.44 --> 3739.52
because yeah people might have uploaded

3737.359 --> 3742.799
a couple of videos

3739.52 --> 3746.72
or made short mention but this group

3742.799 --> 3750.24
actually went for an attempt to really

3746.72 --> 3751.68
take it more literal and not just oh

3750.24 --> 3754.72
it's just another way to

3751.68 --> 3757.44
represent the disk right

3754.72 --> 3758.319
and that i really appreciated about the

3757.44 --> 3761.52
channel

3758.319 --> 3762.72
not so much the intellectual cohesion

3761.52 --> 3765.119
level

3762.72 --> 3767.2
that was not all that great and i did

3765.119 --> 3770.799
not get really respect for

3767.2 --> 3772.5589999999997
my level in that area but yeah i was

3770.799 --> 3775.0389999999998
part of that for a short period

3772.559 --> 3776.799
because they entertained the rectangular

3775.039 --> 3780.1600000000003
looping model or at least

3776.799 --> 3784.64
a version of it now since that time

3780.16 --> 3788.24
i've expanded a lot on the conceptions

3784.64 --> 3790.4
of the potentially looping realm and

3788.24 --> 3791.52
what the orientation is and how you

3790.4 --> 3794.64
figure that out so

3791.52 --> 3797.839
i surpassed the work

3794.64 --> 3797.839
in that direction

3797.92 --> 3803.359
i pretty much surpassed anybody that's

3800.079 --> 3803.3590000000004
ever gone there

3803.68 --> 3807.0389999999998
and the funny thing is i can say this

3806.0 --> 3809.52
and

3807.039 --> 3811.76
be sure that it is actually true there's

3809.52 --> 3816.0
just literally nobody out there

3811.76 --> 3817.039
nobody hey and if they are out there i'd

3816.0 --> 3819.44
like to beat you

3817.039 --> 3822.88
and then i'll look into your

3819.44 --> 3822.88
videographer history

3823.52 --> 3828.559
and we'll see who got there first

3828.64 --> 3835.68
yeah i'm the first first first

3831.76 --> 3839.8390000000004
nah i don't think i'm the first

3835.68 --> 3839.839
i think that uh

3840.16 --> 3844.319
free energy who's now called square

3843.28 --> 3847.44
earth

3844.319 --> 3850.0
cosmology i think he

3847.44 --> 3851.599
was on there probably way earlier than

3850.0 --> 3854.48
anybody

3851.599 --> 3854.48
it's just that

3854.799 --> 3858.079
he's never been much of a debater he

3857.599 --> 3861.039
just

3858.079 --> 3864.88
had an idea he's expanded that idea he

3861.039 --> 3868.4
made some really awesome cgi models

3864.88 --> 3871.52
so he's like had a very rigid

3868.4 --> 3874.1600000000003
view of how the rectangular looping

3871.52 --> 3874.16
model is

3874.24 --> 3880.3999999999996
right so i'm more of a theorist

3877.359 --> 3881.5989999999997
it by nature and i do debate things and

3880.4 --> 3883.76
possibilities and

3881.599 --> 3886.2400000000002
basically help others to try and

3883.76 --> 3889.5200000000004
conceive of these things themselves

3886.24 --> 3889.52
and not get confused

3891.28 --> 3896.3190000000004
and in that i am the first

3894.48 --> 3899.92
i am the first to actually have some

3896.319 --> 3899.92
cohesive ideas

3900.72 --> 3913.5989999999997
in that area so that's the difference

3908.88 --> 3923.839
can i put it on paper what

3913.599 --> 3923.839
are you talking to me

3935.2 --> 3938.8799999999997
yeah foul and vocab well what look these

3937.839 --> 3942.24
trolls are so

3938.88 --> 3946.559
tired out intellectually

3942.24 --> 3950.0789999999997
that their primary goal is not even to

3946.559 --> 3953.599
win against us it's just a throw off us

3950.079 --> 3956.88
of us of course distraction

3953.599 --> 3960.2400000000002
like in the face of a no-win situation

3956.88 --> 3961.839
distraction is the only viable strategy

3960.24 --> 3963.839
and that's exactly what they do and

3961.839 --> 3964.16
they're very good at it so they'll draw

3963.839 --> 3966.0
in

3964.16 --> 3968.0789999999997
things that they think will throw me off

3966.0 --> 3971.44
course in a moment break me the moment

3968.079 --> 3974.88
overlooking then i'm very apt

3971.44 --> 3978.2400000000002
at times to actually pick up

3974.88 --> 3979.28
on such an attempt and then completely

3978.24 --> 3982.3999999999996
reverse it around

3979.28 --> 3984.559
and show that i can actually in detail

3982.4 --> 3985.44
answer every aspect about it and i'm not

3984.559 --> 3988.079
afraid to

3985.44 --> 3989.839
even though they thought i would be

3988.079 --> 3993.8390000000004
because they can't imagine

3989.839 --> 3993.839
that i'm not afraid about it

4011.359 --> 4014.96
now if you're just gonna make just

4013.039 --> 4016.48
random stupid remarks

4014.96 --> 4018.2400000000002
as a first appearance then i'm just

4016.48 --> 4021.839
gonna ban you

4018.24 --> 4021.839
because that's what socks do

4032.0 --> 4039.039
dr gonzo well almost

4036.0 --> 4042.24
not so much cohesive ideas right because

4039.039 --> 4044.559
hey there's a lot of cohesive ideas

4042.24 --> 4045.4399999999996
in the flat earth and a lot of woozy

4044.559 --> 4048.48
ideas

4045.44 --> 4053.039
more fantastical ideas

4048.48 --> 4058.16
but i've been cosmogeny

4053.039 --> 4058.1600000000003
wise the most cohesive

4060.0 --> 4066.88
like i can really tell you what

4063.44 --> 4069.359
is what i don't know

4066.88 --> 4070.6400000000003
and what could be and and map it out

4069.359 --> 4073.7599999999998
perfect

4070.64 --> 4077.2
map it out perfectly

4073.76 --> 4078.1600000000003
and expand it as i'm going as i'm going

4077.2 --> 4090.0789999999997
on this

4078.16 --> 4093.5989999999997
journey with everybody

4090.079 --> 4095.76
dr gonzo maybe there just isn't any edge

4093.599 --> 4096.64
maybe the edge is too hard to attain

4095.76 --> 4100.08
whatever

4096.64 --> 4100.08
that's even supposed to mean

4101.92 --> 4105.679
you know in a rectangular looping setup

4104.319 --> 4110.4800000000005
there is no edge

4105.679 --> 4110.4800000000005
it loops get it it loops

4111.679 --> 4119.839
plane flat plane looping in

4115.679 --> 4119.839
on itself

4120.159 --> 4128.239
yeah no edge

4123.679 --> 4128.2390000000005
flat and no edge yeah i know it's a real

4130.839 --> 4133.839
disappointment

4156.4 --> 4162.719
so yeah when it comes to modeling

4159.679 --> 4165.759
modeling the realm

4162.719 --> 4169.44
i think i am

4165.759 --> 4172.96
pretty pretty efficient and cohesive

4169.44 --> 4176.239
good at it and quick

4172.96 --> 4178.719
like i don't need to look oh oh let me

4176.239 --> 4180.799
let me quickly google something green no

4178.719 --> 4183.359
no if you ask me about

4180.799 --> 4184.88
that field specifically like the layout

4183.359 --> 4188.96
the cosmogeny

4184.88 --> 4192.08
all i don't have to look [ __ ] up

4188.96 --> 4194.2390000000005
i just know it because it's important to

4192.08 --> 4194.239
me

4196.159 --> 4199.759999999999
how many people you know do that i know

4199.199 --> 4204.08
a couple

4199.76 --> 4207.6
you know nathan does it too but

4204.08 --> 4208.159
with his priorities he's kind of fixated

4207.6 --> 4211.76
on a more

4208.159 --> 4215.92
narrow field the the edge

4211.76 --> 4216.400000000001
of the sword that he chops clovers down

4215.92 --> 4220.719
with

4216.4 --> 4225.44
that's the part that he learns by heart

4220.719 --> 4228.4
right it's his focus qe

4225.44 --> 4229.44
has slightly different focus like his

4228.4 --> 4232.799999999999
sharpened edge

4229.44 --> 4232.799999999999
is like really the

4233.12 --> 4237.04
the mechanics like the

4238.239 --> 4242.0
the academic mechanics

4243.12 --> 4249.04
and he doesn't like me

4246.4 --> 4250.799999999999
nathan even we do have to look some of

4249.04 --> 4252.96
that up sometimes

4250.8 --> 4255.84
huey doesn't have to look it up he just

4252.96 --> 4255.84
freaking knows it

4256.84 --> 4259.84
right

4261.199 --> 4269.839999999999
right so flat earth loops within itself

4266.719 --> 4274.32
that's a weird way to formulate it but

4269.84 --> 4274.32
yes it it it remains a possibility

4278.719 --> 4287.84
specifically east to west

4294.88 --> 4302.56
they don't believe in the looping model

4298.719 --> 4302.56
they don't leave what

4302.64 --> 4306.0
you're talking about nathan and kiwi

4305.12 --> 4309.04
well they're not

4306.0 --> 4309.04
they don't really care

4313.679 --> 4317.28
they're just not concerned really they

4316.0 --> 4319.52
understand

4317.28 --> 4322.239
the model i've explained it in ways that

4319.52 --> 4324.719
they at least can conceive of it

4322.239 --> 4328.959999999999
they're just not really prepared to take

4324.719 --> 4330.159
it serious because they're more

4328.96 --> 4333.84
concerned with

4330.159 --> 4343.839999999999
chopping globers right that's what they

4333.84 --> 4343.84
like to do

4348.08 --> 4352.719
ah yeah that's a very wishful thinking

4351.6 --> 4355.84
red pill trail

4352.719 --> 4359.76
there's no curvature though not at all

4355.84 --> 4360.400000000001
it's flat yeah yeah so i know you you

4359.76 --> 4363.679
can

4360.4 --> 4366.5599999999995
if you just presuppose are

4363.679 --> 4368.159
yeah then it's very easy to imagine the

4366.56 --> 4370.320000000001
earth to be a globe because

4368.159 --> 4372.639999999999
it's east to west looping yeah but

4370.32 --> 4376.239
you're overlooking there's no curvature

4372.64 --> 4377.4400000000005
it's actually i think is perfectly

4376.239 --> 4379.839999999999
straight line

4377.44 --> 4381.5199999999995
might also be a not perfectly straight

4379.84 --> 4385.4400000000005
line

4381.52 --> 4388.88
there's no curve so whether that line is

4385.44 --> 4389.759999999999
into the straight distance perfectly

4388.88 --> 4393.6
straight or

4389.76 --> 4396.8
if it has a weird curve maybe

4393.6 --> 4399.92
not even a non-circle curve like a

4396.8 --> 4402.08
incomplete circle like an arc or hey

4399.92 --> 4404.4
maybe it does turn out to connect like a

4402.08 --> 4407.6
circle

4404.4 --> 4408.32
and there's yeah it's warped in other

4407.6 --> 4412.08
ways so

4408.32 --> 4414.239
this yeah spatial non-linearity

4412.08 --> 4415.5199999999995
the options are just there to be

4414.239 --> 4418.799999999999
discovered

4415.52 --> 4422.56
or rather to be figured out and then

4418.8 --> 4424.400000000001
test it like how does it interconnect

4422.56 --> 4426.56
and while you're trying to do that can

4424.4 --> 4430.639999999999
you let go

4426.56 --> 4433.52
can you let go of the notion that maybe

4430.64 --> 4433.84
maybe space is not entirely linear and

4433.52 --> 4436.8
like

4433.84 --> 4438.84
how things are connected are not

4436.8 --> 4441.76
actually

4438.84 --> 4444.88
geometrical like they're interconnected

4441.76 --> 4448.320000000001
in a very weird way

4444.88 --> 4451.52
that you just can't really ascribe

4448.32 --> 4453.5199999999995
to any literal geometry

4451.52 --> 4454.8
because of the flatness of it all right

4453.52 --> 4456.88
it's all flat so yeah

4454.8 --> 4458.8
even hey even it's always been an option

4456.88 --> 4460.400000000001
it's always been a lovely lovely option

4458.8 --> 4463.4400000000005
the flat globe

4460.4 --> 4465.12
yeah landmasses maybe antarctica is this

4463.44 --> 4467.12
weird little island

4465.12 --> 4469.5199999999995
i don't think it is i think it's rather

4467.12 --> 4474.159
just an entire region

4469.52 --> 4478.080000000001
potentially blocking another region

4474.159 --> 4479.199
but if it is an island then yeah maybe

4478.08 --> 4482.719
this

4479.199 --> 4485.199
this flat realm interconnects exactly

4482.719 --> 4487.28
like a freaking globe it is in the globe

4485.199 --> 4488.719
though but it might actually connect

4487.28 --> 4490.719
like a globe

4488.719 --> 4492.64
and then it's all still flat and then

4490.719 --> 4494.32
there's some people that will have so

4492.64 --> 4498.8
much trouble in their mind

4494.32 --> 4503.5199999999995
just just letting it slip in

4498.8 --> 4506.8
just accepting that it's freaking flat

4503.52 --> 4508.64
and the glow at the same time not

4506.8 --> 4511.84
literal glow

4508.64 --> 4511.84
but interconnected

4527.44 --> 4531.599999999999
dude just stop it already

4536.48 --> 4539.919999999999
right so it might turn out to be just

4538.239 --> 4543.36
that

4539.92 --> 4548.4
flat globe oh flat globe

4543.36 --> 4551.12
flat globe yeah not geometrical globe

4548.4 --> 4552.5599999999995
but interconnected as if it were a globe

4551.12 --> 4555.719
but it's flat

4552.56 --> 4556.88
ah oh isn't that just nice this

4555.719 --> 4560.64
geometrically

4556.88 --> 4563.679
unsolvable mystery yeah a mystery that

4560.64 --> 4565.04
might potentially be unsolvable no

4563.679 --> 4568.4
matter what you do

4565.04 --> 4571.92
like a living mathematical paradox

4568.4 --> 4574.0
in your face in the real world forever

4571.92 --> 4575.1990000000005
oh yeah some people are gonna have some

4574.0 --> 4577.12
trouble with that

4575.199 --> 4579.36
pretty sure if that turns out to be the

4577.12 --> 4582.5599999999995
case that the earth is

4579.36 --> 4584.639999999999
actually a flat globe and that's a

4582.56 --> 4586.56
concept that i called on the very

4584.64 --> 4588.88
first live show that i ever did on this

4586.56 --> 4588.88
channel

4589.28 --> 4593.679
and by the way i have all the flat earth

4590.88 --> 4596.2390000000005
talks i have them all downloaded

4593.679 --> 4597.679
so whatever youtube's going to do with

4596.239 --> 4600.08
my channel

4597.679 --> 4601.76
all the early stuff it's all there and

4600.08 --> 4602.159
everything that came after it's pretty

4601.76 --> 4605.52
much

4602.159 --> 4607.599999999999
been me developing

4605.52 --> 4610.88
but it's good to have those very very

4607.6 --> 4610.88
very early days

4611.199 --> 4617.5199999999995
to show you that i did not

4614.32 --> 4619.5199999999995
gradually fabricate my ideas now i

4617.52 --> 4622.8
pretty much had the ideas

4619.52 --> 4625.92
at the start they were there

4622.8 --> 4628.88
i just needed to learn to

4625.92 --> 4629.4400000000005
figure it out better what i was thinking

4628.88 --> 4631.679
and

4629.44 --> 4632.799999999999
figuring out like what is it actually

4631.679 --> 4636.159
that

4632.8 --> 4640.08
i'm suspecting here

4636.159 --> 4640.08
what does it mean what does it imply

4647.199 --> 4651.839999999999
what samson

4660.88 --> 4665.84
since when is my chat so filled with

4663.12 --> 4665.84
ballers

4669.92 --> 4674.56
i hope you guys still realize there's

4671.679 --> 4677.679
still rules right

4674.56 --> 4693.84
so just

4677.679 --> 4693.84
whatever you'll find out

4709.6 --> 4713.1990000000005
okay fellow lambo cannon

4716.0 --> 4722.159
dude isn't it a little early for a

4719.679 --> 4722.159
whiskey

4732.159 --> 4737.5199999999995
all right but do you guys at least get

4734.719 --> 4740.96
it the flat globe

4737.52 --> 4743.1990000000005
like how freaky would that be

4740.96 --> 4744.32
we know it's flat it's geometrically

4743.199 --> 4746.4
flat

4744.32 --> 4748.239
but yeah who knows when you start to

4746.4 --> 4751.599999999999
just put everything together

4748.239 --> 4754.0
euclidean wise you start you you try to

4751.6 --> 4754.719
put it together piece by piece every

4754.0 --> 4757.679
piece of

4754.719 --> 4758.2390000000005
ocean bottom every piece of land put it

4757.679 --> 4760.88
together

4758.239 --> 4763.199
like a puzzle and we know it's flat it's

4760.88 --> 4766.56
geometrically flat

4763.199 --> 4768.5599999999995
measurable flat but

4766.56 --> 4769.6
yeah what if it actually when you puzzle

4768.56 --> 4771.4400000000005
it together it does

4769.6 --> 4772.64
freaking connect like a globe what the

4771.44 --> 4775.919999999999
hell do you do with that

4772.64 --> 4776.56
you know that is so freaky it's like a

4775.92 --> 4779.04
huge

4776.56 --> 4780.88
surreal slap in the face from god it's

4779.04 --> 4785.199
like oh oh you think you

4780.88 --> 4789.36
can figure out the world bang

4785.199 --> 4789.36
yeah unsolvable puzzle

4789.52 --> 4805.84
what do you do then

4823.679 --> 4829.12
wait are you talking to me i have no

4830.84 --> 4833.84
escobar

4847.679 --> 4852.719
i watched that video which video clutch

4850.48 --> 4852.718999999999
bear

4854.0 --> 4857.36
you mean my first video

4859.28 --> 4862.719
when it was all pale with nerves and

4861.36 --> 4875.839999999999
[ __ ]

4862.719 --> 4875.84
man i was nervous crazy

4881.199 --> 4888.4
especially nervous to basically reveal

4884.239 --> 4890.48
my mannerisms and how i am on camera

4888.4 --> 4892.638999999999
in public that was the thing that i was

4890.48 --> 4895.678999999999
most nervous about now of course i

4892.639 --> 4896.719
am used to it it's like yeah yeah people

4895.679 --> 4898.56
got used to me

4896.719 --> 4901.12
there's probably people out there that

4898.56 --> 4905.120000000001
are getting more used to me

4901.12 --> 4905.12
than i get to myself

4905.36 --> 4909.5199999999995
but it's like it's already done you know

4907.679 --> 4912.96
it's not a new thing anymore

4909.52 --> 4917.84
i know what it's like i know i am

4912.96 --> 4917.84
known as who i am out there

4922.4 --> 4931.839999999999
what is the end goal of what

4927.6 --> 4931.84
of what

4949.199 --> 4959.839999999999
okay never heard of that easy monkeys

4952.88 --> 4959.84
what's it about

4970.96 --> 4974.4800000000005
oh you sent a link yesterday can't

4972.32 --> 4977.599999999999
remember the dude name

4974.48 --> 4979.44
yeah yeah what he

4977.6 --> 4980.88
coned in terry what are you talking

4979.44 --> 4983.678999999999
about is he

4980.88 --> 4984.0
declared terrorist serious or is that

4983.679 --> 5001.84
just

4984.0 --> 5001.84
social media sjw [ __ ]

5040.84 --> 5043.84
what

5046.4 --> 5052.32
what's your knowledge about algorithms

5049.44 --> 5052.32
the [ __ ] dude

5052.639 --> 5056.08
yeah this japan guy is kind of like

5055.12 --> 5061.44
entered the

5056.08 --> 5061.44
the chat all sorting it's a little silly

5066.159 --> 5069.599999999999
it may be you think it may be yeah yeah

5068.88 --> 5073.1990000000005
it's called

5069.6 --> 5075.120000000001
honesty yeah

5073.199 --> 5085.839999999999
it's called honesty about what you don't

5075.12 --> 5085.84
know with certainty

5087.92 --> 5092.2390000000005
maybe you did actually no if it were

5090.4 --> 5094.638999999999
there was no curvature

5092.239 --> 5096.239
that would be curvature yeah if it is a

5094.639 --> 5099.84
globe it would be curvature

5096.239 --> 5102.4
and don't you know you know

5099.84 --> 5104.400000000001
the deal in ifranzi you know the

5102.4 --> 5107.759999999999
arguments those arguments still

5104.4 --> 5109.759999999999
stand yeah yeah this this is this is the

5107.76 --> 5110.56
funny part this is the funny part where

5109.76 --> 5114.56
it's almost

5110.56 --> 5116.0
funny to have funny zealot globers like

5114.56 --> 5118.88
yourself

5116.0 --> 5119.84
to know what could happen to you in the

5118.88 --> 5123.04
end

5119.84 --> 5126.159000000001
when it's literally the lie that you

5123.04 --> 5128.48
accept it is going to literally destroy

5126.159 --> 5130.0
you from the inside like nothing you've

5128.48 --> 5133.678999999999
ever seen

5130.0 --> 5136.0
right because what if yeah we

5133.679 --> 5137.84
know the earth is flat we know it there

5136.0 --> 5141.04
is no evidence it is a

5137.84 --> 5144.08
literal geometrical globe of any sort

5141.04 --> 5146.08
right everything has been drawn into it

5144.08 --> 5147.44
everything that is real and physical has

5146.08 --> 5150.639
been drawn into it

5147.44 --> 5154.159
in order to disprove a literal

5150.639 --> 5156.159000000001
globular geometry of the earth right

5154.159 --> 5157.199
but yeah maybe in the end it would be

5156.159 --> 5159.759999999999
connected like that

5157.199 --> 5161.12
and it's like it would be staring you in

5159.76 --> 5164.159000000001
the face it would be

5161.12 --> 5166.5599999999995
screaming from your inside but

5164.159 --> 5168.4
it is a globe but it is a globe because

5166.56 --> 5170.96
it's connected like a glove we just oh

5168.4 --> 5174.4
we found the proof it's a globe

5170.96 --> 5175.92
even though it's all flat all of it is

5174.4 --> 5179.679
flat

5175.92 --> 5181.92
yeah and it's gonna torture you forever

5179.679 --> 5184.159
until you freaking end yourself if that

5181.92 --> 5184.88
happens if it actually turns out to be

5184.159 --> 5189.04
like that

5184.88 --> 5189.04
yeah it's gonna freaking kill you

5189.52 --> 5196.159000000001
because it's not a literal globe

5193.52 --> 5196.719
but you'll you'll be tortured by that

5196.159 --> 5200.0
last

5196.719 --> 5202.56
puzzle piece giving you like a last

5200.0 --> 5204.56
kick in the balls like yeah yeah yeah

5202.56 --> 5207.6
but you could think of it as a globe

5204.56 --> 5209.360000000001
you could think of it yeah yeah yeah it

5207.6 --> 5212.400000000001
may turn out to be like that

5209.36 --> 5216.08
in that way i would be kind of like

5212.4 --> 5218.799999999999
satisfied because of

5216.08 --> 5221.84
basically the indoctrination you've

5218.8 --> 5224.88
subjected yourself and the world to

5221.84 --> 5226.08
that you'll be punished for that from

5224.88 --> 5229.76
the inside

5226.08 --> 5232.88
by god's design it would be a

5229.76 --> 5236.0
lovely round out to

5232.88 --> 5237.4400000000005
to round out the sin process that you've

5236.0 --> 5253.84
engaged in

5237.44 --> 5253.839999999999
with your religious fanaticism

5259.199 --> 5262.48
no i'm not saying flat is curved it is

5261.12 --> 5265.679
flat

5262.48 --> 5267.678999999999
did i say that the interconnection of

5265.679 --> 5271.1990000000005
the land masses

5267.679 --> 5273.1990000000005
are curved no it's all flat and flat is

5271.199 --> 5276.4
not curved

5273.199 --> 5277.599999999999
so those are geometrically opposite of

5276.4 --> 5280.08
one another

5277.6 --> 5281.04
one is straight the other is curved yeah

5280.08 --> 5284.48
it's flat

5281.04 --> 5288.32
the earth is flat this is a fact

5284.48 --> 5290.32
can never be any other way it is flat

5288.32 --> 5292.4
but yeah maybe it'll just interconnect

5290.32 --> 5297.12
like a globe just to kick you

5292.4 --> 5299.599999999999
in the nuts one last time

5297.12 --> 5300.88
i would actually be kind of gratified by

5299.6 --> 5303.04
that

5300.88 --> 5306.08
just to know that you're gonna get a one

5303.04 --> 5309.36
last kick in the nuts

5306.08 --> 5311.6
one last punch in the face

5309.36 --> 5315.759999999999
to basically from the inside out

5311.6 --> 5319.120000000001
reinforce the disproven thing

5315.76 --> 5323.92
because i really really hate

5326.32 --> 5333.5199999999995

5328.48 --> 5334.799999999999
inflame them get them more more terrible

5333.52 --> 5337.4400000000005

5334.8 --> 5339.84
with it better but in a way i'm

5337.44 --> 5341.5199999999995
like i am so much with the truth and

5339.84 --> 5342.400000000001
actually being honest and technically
