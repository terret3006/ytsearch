i want to hear your

261.519 --> 266.479

263.84 --> 266.479
blueberry

266.84 --> 270.23999999999995

esoterics

270.24 --> 275.6
spirit mechanics

271.919 --> 275.59999999999997
that you got out of it

276.8 --> 279.8
etc

282.8 --> 287.12
but i'll get into that as more people

284.72 --> 287.12
get in

288.4 --> 290.63899999999995
yeah

291.28 --> 295.67999999999995
right so yeah flat earth debates

293.6 --> 298.72
yesterday was really good although

295.68 --> 301.84000000000003
nathan cut it short again

298.72 --> 304.47900000000004
and we were disappointed again

301.84 --> 306.479
because we had a lot of energy the guys

304.479 --> 307.68
during the after show and we were

306.479 --> 310.08
like

307.68 --> 311.44
getting going and then just like i don't

310.08 --> 313.68
know nathan just

311.44 --> 315.919
kind of slipped away

313.68 --> 315.919
uh

316.16 --> 321.12
maybe today he'll have a longer show

318.88 --> 323.039
longer after show he usually does pick

321.12 --> 325.68
out like a

323.039 --> 329.12
day or a couple of days a week when he

325.68 --> 329.12
does do a long after show

329.52 --> 333.919
uh

331.36 --> 333.91900000000004
we'll see

334.96 --> 340.0
thursday usually if he does it it is on

337.759 --> 343.199
thursday

340.0 --> 347.12
it's usually thursday or friday

343.199 --> 347.12
sometimes wednesday anyway

347.44 --> 351.08
how are you guys doing

352.88 --> 356.0
hey pgcnet

357.039 --> 363.199
yeah yesterday man over at gymbops

360.08 --> 363.199
was quite a blast

364.16 --> 368.0
because owen benjamin was on there

367.039 --> 370.479
and

368.0 --> 371.759
they were like

370.479 --> 375.52
wow

371.759 --> 375.52000000000004
it was it was really great

378.319 --> 381.84000000000003
it's like the best of both sides

386.72 --> 391.68
ascension day

389.52 --> 395.35999999999996
right

391.68 --> 398.08
when jesus ascended to heaven after the

395.36 --> 398.08000000000004
resurrection

398.56 --> 401.36
that makes sense

402.72 --> 407.40000000000003
it's a very funny overcoming gravity

408.56 --> 414.0
right or maybe he simply didn't have any

412.88 --> 416.15999999999997
mass

414.0 --> 418.0
in his body

416.16 --> 421.12
in order to

418.0 --> 424.8
have obstruction maybe like

421.12 --> 424.8
let's get a little weird maybe

425.36 --> 429.039
it's not like the first time i even

426.88 --> 430.96
heard anybody say that

429.039 --> 433.28
that

430.96 --> 434.96
what returned wasn't literally his

433.28 --> 437.75899999999996
physical body

434.96 --> 440.31899999999996
it was more like

437.759 --> 443.91900000000004
like an astral projection made solid

440.319 --> 443.91900000000004
like a true projection

445.44 --> 449.599
right

447.199 --> 451.84000000000003
that isn't like obstructed by the

449.599 --> 454.4
typical physical limits

451.84 --> 454.4
i don't know

455.84 --> 460.0
check out gym up yeah yeah certainly do

458.16 --> 462.8
yeah yesterday's show was really amazing

460.0 --> 462.8
and i was like

463.36 --> 468.40000000000003
i was having a great time in the chat

465.52 --> 468.4
very inspired

473.12 --> 476.919
i'll link you up

485.919 --> 492.19899999999996
wow

487.759 --> 492.199
three over three thousand views

513.839 --> 516.839
uh

521.76 --> 525.519
anyway

522.719 --> 526.9590000000001
yeah i chosen the title for today but

525.519 --> 528.88
it's basically

526.959 --> 531.1999999999999
i don't even necessarily want to talk

528.88 --> 533.519
about that so i might just erase the

531.2 --> 533.519
title

533.92 --> 537.519
it's

534.72 --> 540.1600000000001
almost a trope

537.519 --> 540.16
at this point

540.64 --> 545.48
yeah

541.68 --> 545.4799999999999
looking back at it

560.56 --> 567.1199999999999
right so

563.68 --> 569.5999999999999
pjc net did you see

567.12 --> 574.36
blueberry did you get to see it

569.6 --> 574.36
you said that you were gonna watch it

607.92 --> 611.12
yeah god damn it

617.279 --> 623.36
um right you haven't found a good

619.76 --> 626.3199999999999
reasonable quality stream yet

623.36 --> 626.32
yeah that's annoying

628.0 --> 632.8
i mean i could

630.079 --> 634.88
like look it up

632.8 --> 637.04
through torrents

634.88 --> 639.68
like one that certainly will have like

637.04 --> 641.68
subtitles i i could go out and look for

639.68 --> 646.5999999999999
one

641.68 --> 646.5999999999999
i'm fairly sure i will find it

652.0 --> 657.839
oh god you watched ride watching it with

654.079 --> 660.8389999999999
that so i warned you about that seth

657.839 --> 660.839
uh

667.68 --> 673.4399999999999
subtitles are portuguese well if you hey

670.64 --> 674.88
if you can speak portuguese then why not

673.44 --> 677.2
but

674.88 --> 677.2
yeah

686.16 --> 689.6
yeah but

687.44 --> 691.9200000000001
just don't watch it

689.6 --> 694.0790000000001
don't watch it until you just get proper

691.92 --> 696.16
subtitles

694.079 --> 698.399
because i warned you about it like you

696.16 --> 702.279
will just go and watch it for the

698.399 --> 702.279
visuals and then

702.48 --> 706.0

704.079 --> 710.8
before you know it you like ruined half

706.0 --> 712.639

712.639 --> 715.639
subtitles

716.16 --> 719.8389999999999
can't say i didn't try this

re-spoken

881.279 --> 885.8389999999999
verbals

1057.6 --> 1063.1999999999998
very easy for me to just give you

1060.72 --> 1066.559
any kind of raw link

1063.2 --> 1068.96
bypassing all social media

1066.559 --> 1070.6399999999999
situations

1068.96 --> 1073.039
it can just

1070.64 --> 1076.24
much quicker give you access to whatever

1073.039 --> 1076.24
i'm even talking about

1078.08 --> 1085.36
yes metal slugs cockatiel

1081.84 --> 1085.36

1092.72 --> 1097.679
you have to get on skype i'm just saying

1094.96 --> 1100.16
like oh if you have trouble it's

1097.679 --> 1100.16
not like

1100.4 --> 1104.72
look at all these other guys here in

1102.16 --> 1108.4
chat that all have their own

1104.72 --> 1110.32
ability ranges and their own fields

1108.4 --> 1113.52
that they kind of master

1110.32 --> 1116.72
why don't you use it

1113.52 --> 1118.96

1116.72 --> 1120.88
everyone here is very it will very

1118.96 --> 1122.799
easily help you out

1120.88 --> 1123.919
like if you have some trouble finding

1122.799 --> 1126.24
something

1123.919 --> 1128.16
or whatever

1126.24 --> 1132.4
if you connect up

1128.16 --> 1134.559
outside of just the chat here

1132.4 --> 1138.5590000000002
the live chat

1134.559 --> 1140.96
then you can share these things that's

1138.559 --> 1144.32
like social media connecting like that's

1140.96 --> 1146.96
why there even is like this skype group

1144.32 --> 1149.12
around flat earth debates

1146.96 --> 1151.6000000000001
i mean that skype chat's been out there

1149.12 --> 1154.9599999999998
for what is it now

1151.6 --> 1154.9599999999998
five or six years

1156.24 --> 1161.76
we use that constantly to connect each

1159.679 --> 1163.039
other to like say oh look at this video

1161.76 --> 1165.919
look at that

1163.039 --> 1168.72
drop this music file

1165.919 --> 1170.4
or some pdf file right you could just

1168.72 --> 1174.52
share anything

1170.4 --> 1174.52
so much easier that way

1178.799 --> 1182.48
do they have to self-serving supermarket

1181.2 --> 1185.1200000000001
checkouts

1182.48 --> 1186.799
yes they do in

1185.12 --> 1190.0
in the yeah and some of the more

1186.799 --> 1193.84
mainstream supermarkets yeah

1190.0 --> 1193.84
not in the one where i'm at

1194.96 --> 1199.08
i i don't really use that

1215.679 --> 1220.0800000000002
yeah right

1217.12 --> 1222.1589999999999
tony

1220.08 --> 1223.9189999999999
but look

1222.159 --> 1225.3600000000001
just think about it

1223.919 --> 1228.64
and maybe

1225.36 --> 1231.36
some other maybe skype is like you guys

1228.64 --> 1235.3600000000001
have some objections

1231.36 --> 1238.799
for whatever reason and well

1235.36 --> 1241.6
i'd be even willing to try some other

1238.799 --> 1243.44
type of yeah social media communication

1241.6 --> 1248.12
form

1243.44 --> 1248.1200000000001
another type of chat box system

1249.679 --> 1256.4
if that would work out even better it's

1252.48 --> 1257.2
just that skype i'm very used to it

1256.4 --> 1258.96
like

1257.2 --> 1260.72
i've been using it

1258.96 --> 1264.24
very long i know

1260.72 --> 1266.72
what it is how it works how it's changed

1264.24 --> 1269.28
like what the gravels of it effectively

1266.72 --> 1269.28
are even

1271.039 --> 1276.1589999999999
because i am pretty sure it is being

1273.6 --> 1278.7199999999998
spied upon it's just not never really

1276.159 --> 1279.919
used for legal things

1278.72 --> 1281.84
but

1279.919 --> 1283.679
like i'm quite certain in general

1281.84 --> 1288.12
there's a lot of like

1283.679 --> 1288.1200000000001
idea fishing going on

1290.48 --> 1293.1200000000001
right that's why

1291.919 --> 1295.5200000000002
i always

1293.12 --> 1296.9599999999998
i never think like oh is this truly

1295.52 --> 1299.9189999999999
private

1296.96 --> 1302.32
no it's just private for

1299.919 --> 1305.039
that person and me versus the other

1302.32 --> 1307.36
people kind of going around us because

1305.039 --> 1310.64
i'm pretty sure there will be spying

1307.36 --> 1314.32
upon effectively what we're saying

1310.64 --> 1314.3200000000002
and there might be idea fishing

1314.96 --> 1319.919
right i'm always like assuming that

1317.52 --> 1323.12
everybody's reading it oh it's private

1319.919 --> 1325.039
yeah no that i really don't

1323.12 --> 1328.1589999999999
believe in that anymore

1325.039 --> 1328.1589999999999
that that's real

1328.48 --> 1332.0
so

1330.159 --> 1334.96
but yeah that's just the way

1332.0 --> 1334.96
how i go about it

1339.2 --> 1346.2
skype is owned by bill gaten

1342.64 --> 1346.2
it's part of microsoft

1368.96 --> 1371.96
hmm

1374.159 --> 1377.5200000000002
the whatsapp right

1381.039 --> 1384.24
now they used to be very popular here as

1383.2 --> 1387.52
well

1384.24 --> 1391.36
i've actually kind of avoided it

1387.52 --> 1391.36
because i don't know what it is

1391.52 --> 1394.24
was it again

1395.679 --> 1399.5590000000002
some issues with it

1410.16 --> 1415.88
[Music]

1412.4 --> 1415.88
sucker third

1416.77 --> 1420.6399999999999
[Music]

1418.24 --> 1423.919
right anyway

1420.64 --> 1423.919
it was just an idea

1425.84 --> 1430.8799999999999
right it's not like oh the opportunity

1428.159 --> 1432.88
oh we can have social media contact that

1430.88 --> 1435.679
means that we can like have all these

1432.88 --> 1438.159
secret idea exchanges

1435.679 --> 1441.039
yeah no i don't believe that exists

1438.159 --> 1441.0390000000002
anymore really

1441.2 --> 1446.96
you always i always assume that

1443.679 --> 1446.96
somebody's listening anyway

1447.679 --> 1452.5590000000002
anyway but

1449.279 --> 1452.559
that's just me again

1453.6 --> 1459.84
brandon has a lot of issues

1456.64 --> 1459.8400000000001
oh dear

1463.2 --> 1468.32
why not discord you could do look i

1465.919 --> 1473.3200000000002
effectively have a discord channel i

1468.32 --> 1473.32
just don't really do anything with it

1477.12 --> 1480.76
it's kind of abandoned

1482.19 --> 1485.39
[Music]

1510.159 --> 1517.0800000000002
what the [ __ ]

1512.96 --> 1517.08
rich from sc jesus

1530.08 --> 1532.3999999999999
what

1540.159 --> 1546.7990000000002
okay so what the hell so he saw a sign

1544.799 --> 1549.2
bring your own bag

1546.799 --> 1551.2
and he just assumed

1549.2 --> 1555.1200000000001
it was his mother and went berserk like

1551.2 --> 1555.1200000000001
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

1555.52 --> 1560.279
i don't get it

1556.96 --> 1560.279
that's crazy

1570.0 --> 1574.32
okay if it's just a joke i get it if

1572.559 --> 1576.24
you're actually describing something

1574.32 --> 1578.72
that's supposedly real that's quite

1576.24 --> 1578.72
insane

1582.32 --> 1585.32
uh

1586.7 --> 1589.769
[Music]

1603.679 --> 1607.52
look at my discord no not really look

1605.76 --> 1609.84
it's not gonna work out with the discord

1607.52 --> 1609.84
because

1610.64 --> 1617.279
if you actually want to have a discord

1612.72 --> 1620.559
server it becomes high maintenance

1617.279 --> 1620.559
and i don't want that

1621.2 --> 1626.96
like i'm naturally

1623.36 --> 1629.12
inclined to withdraw from discord

1626.96 --> 1631.039
i just i've never really thought it was

1629.12 --> 1634.08
a pleasant platform

1631.039 --> 1637.76
so many issues and it's

1634.08 --> 1637.76
just there's something weird about it

1638.559 --> 1643.36
so i have that thing but if we're

1641.52 --> 1646.08
actually gonna use it then it's gonna

1643.36 --> 1649.279
require like a maintenance that i'm not

1646.08 --> 1652.96
willing to basically provide

1649.279 --> 1655.84
because i find it very draining

1652.96 --> 1655.8400000000001
uh

1668.88 --> 1673.6000000000001
you could have the wrenches here

1670.96 --> 1673.6000000000001
maintain it

1674.96 --> 1678.559
no

1676.32 --> 1682.799
no you know what that's gonna actually

1678.559 --> 1684.799
cause like friction among you guys

1682.799 --> 1687.96
it's just gonna be a giant distraction

1684.799 --> 1687.96
to this

1708.96 --> 1713.8400000000001
tony whitcomb is in a

1711.12 --> 1713.84
silly mood

1722.88 --> 1725.8400000000001
right so

1729.279 --> 1734.399
yeah what do you guys want me to address

1731.44 --> 1736.88
i mean this is kind of getting a bit

1734.399 --> 1736.8799999999999
fuzzy

1737.12 --> 1742.08
i guess nobody watched blueberry because

1739.36 --> 1745.4399999999998
they all tried to find subtitles good at

1742.08 --> 1748.6399999999999
find it or like had the italian version

1745.44 --> 1752.52
i forgot that there is like multiple

1748.64 --> 1752.5200000000002
language versions

1753.76 --> 1758.6
but yeah kind of disappointed about that

1775.44 --> 1780.3200000000002
all right

1776.559 --> 1783.12
to take monkey pox

1780.32 --> 1783.12
well yeah

1785.36 --> 1791.84
i think it's completely like it might be

1789.919 --> 1794.7990000000002
even more

1791.84 --> 1797.6789999999999
phantomic

1794.799 --> 1797.679
than covet

1798.24 --> 1802.48
where there were yeah like oh benjamin

1800.48 --> 1804.48
also addressed this

1802.48 --> 1806.84
and i very much agree with him

1804.48 --> 1810.3990000000001
very typical

1806.84 --> 1812.8799999999999
that like with covet at least like the

1810.399 --> 1815.6789999999999
symptoms that were associated would

1812.88 --> 1818.24
typically appear like it had a

1815.679 --> 1820.159
logical covering ground for people to

1818.24 --> 1821.1200000000001
basically latch on to and get worried

1820.159 --> 1823.279
and then

1821.12 --> 1824.559
get strung up in it in the medical

1823.279 --> 1826.48
process

1824.559 --> 1828.6399999999999
but with this it's just

1826.48 --> 1828.64
no

1830.32 --> 1835.279
it doesn't work like that like nobody's

1832.24 --> 1837.76
gonna get those symptoms

1835.279 --> 1841.2
there's very specific conditions that

1837.76 --> 1844.48
lead to that so it's all kind of just

1841.2 --> 1844.48
like superficial

1845.88 --> 1852.64
xenophobia like fear porn but it's not

1849.36 --> 1854.08
not in in how we all politically used to

1852.64 --> 1855.279
that word

1854.08 --> 1858.08
but right

1855.279 --> 1859.6
it's like afraid of something that's out

1858.08 --> 1861.519
there

1859.6 --> 1863.1999999999998
but you've never seen it it's just

1861.519 --> 1865.2
everybody talks about it and you're like

1863.2 --> 1867.3600000000001
become really defensive against a

1865.2 --> 1870.0
phantom right so that's why i call it

1867.36 --> 1870.0
phantomic

1870.559 --> 1874.799
it's like a phantom nobody's ever gonna

1872.32 --> 1877.519
see that like nobody's gonna ever see

1874.799 --> 1880.48
somebody that has that

1877.519 --> 1882.559
except maybe yeah well in africa or

1880.48 --> 1884.64
india or some

1882.559 --> 1886.6399999999999
sort of places

1884.64 --> 1888.7990000000002
where there's monkeys and i don't know

1886.64 --> 1892.3200000000002
like where those symptoms typically do

1888.799 --> 1894.0
arrive because it is something that does

1892.32 --> 1896.399
sometimes pop off

1894.0 --> 1898.96
rarely in certain regions it's just

1896.399 --> 1901.279
isolated cases

1898.96 --> 1905.159
right but like in the western world

1901.279 --> 1905.159
nobody's gonna see that

1906.88 --> 1911.8400000000001
right and i assumed

1909.2 --> 1914.0
that well maybe it will come forth from

1911.84 --> 1916.48
the jabs

1914.0 --> 1918.559
like there is a chance to that because

1916.48 --> 1920.64
yeah who knows what they throw in that

1918.559 --> 1922.96
[ __ ]

1920.64 --> 1924.64
predicted many times like

1922.96 --> 1926.799
the amount of things that were in there

1924.64 --> 1929.919
is just unknown

1926.799 --> 1931.039
in things that have already been

1929.919 --> 1934.5590000000002
submitted

1931.039 --> 1937.12
already put in people's bodies like we

1934.559 --> 1938.559
still don't fully know what is all in

1937.12 --> 1940.4799999999998
there

1938.559 --> 1943.36
and i suspected that there's like a

1940.48 --> 1945.2
whole chain of stuff

1943.36 --> 1947.279
like

1945.2 --> 1949.8400000000001
spells ready to get triggered all

1947.279 --> 1949.84
inserted

1951.519 --> 1955.36
that are over time going to be

1955.519 --> 1958.799
triggered

1957.36 --> 1961.4399999999998
used

1958.799 --> 1964.0
right that's a possibility but in this

1961.44 --> 1967.6000000000001
case it might simply be that there isn't

1964.0 --> 1970.24
enough vaccination spread really of that

1967.6 --> 1972.0
very specific sort so that it's just a

1970.24 --> 1973.2
complete dud like nobody's actually

1972.0 --> 1975.519
getting it

1973.2 --> 1979.3600000000001
except for a couple of guys at the gay

1975.519 --> 1982.799
rave in belgium and threatens in spain

1979.36 --> 1984.9599999999998
and literally nobody else

1982.799 --> 1986.399
and then they just try to initiate the

1984.96 --> 1988.96
whole

1986.399 --> 1991.6
virus statistical

1988.96 --> 1994.48
coronation panic process that doesn't

1991.6 --> 1996.48
make any logical sense it's just like a

1994.48 --> 1999.3600000000001
science fiction

1996.48 --> 2001.679
intervention like oh this potential like

1999.36 --> 2004.32
this is considered a virus so we're

2001.679 --> 2006.5590000000002
going to now trace people and where they

2004.32 --> 2009.4399999999998
went and how it could potentially blah

2006.559 --> 2011.36
blah blah blah virology technobabble

2009.44 --> 2013.279
endless nonsense

2011.36 --> 2015.6
and lockdowns

2013.279 --> 2018.08
and sowing of panic for absolutely no

2015.6 --> 2019.12
reason

2018.08 --> 2023.039
right

2019.12 --> 2023.039
you should know the patterns by now

2029.36 --> 2033.1589999999999
hey max the niche

2035.6 --> 2041.6399999999999
literally nobody succeeded

2038.64 --> 2041.64
jesus

2058.72 --> 2062.399
that is almost remarkable

2063.28 --> 2067.76
that it is that hard to find if just a

2065.76 --> 2070.3990000000003
normal english version with english

2067.76 --> 2072.8390000000004
subtitles

2070.399 --> 2075.919
like that is

2072.839 --> 2079.919
weird that you found it in italian and

2075.919 --> 2079.919
all these others portuguese or whatever

2080.159 --> 2083.2000000000003
but

2080.96 --> 2083.2
not

2083.76 --> 2088.8
just in english like why not like

2086.879 --> 2090.24
english is like a

2088.8 --> 2094.0
lot a lot of

2090.24 --> 2094.0
regions in the world i don't get it

2098.16 --> 2102.359
what feel

2099.359 --> 2102.359
blueberry

2111.52 --> 2116.32
yeah that's the subject i was talking

2113.2 --> 2116.3199999999997
about before this

2122.16 --> 2126.3199999999997
jim bob sneaking her own benjamin

2124.56 --> 2129.7999999999997
back yeah

2126.32 --> 2129.8
that was amazing

2135.57 --> 2138.76
[Music]

2149.76 --> 2153.599
even yes the doctor said

2154.079 --> 2157.079
purified

2158.56 --> 2164.48
oh okay tony well i said it too

2161.04 --> 2166.64
yesterday i'm not a doctor but

2164.48 --> 2168.88
pretty much

2166.64 --> 2169.92
i'm saying that too

2168.88 --> 2172.48
it's true

2169.92 --> 2174.96
i'm taking it a step further saying like

2172.48 --> 2176.88
yeah that's just

2174.96 --> 2180.079
technically yeah this hasn't been

2176.88 --> 2182.56
purified and isolated yeah neither has

2180.079 --> 2184.88
any other virus

2182.56 --> 2184.88
ever

2185.119 --> 2187.44
huh

2191.119 --> 2197.28
the entire model conception is science

2194.8 --> 2197.28
fiction

2199.359 --> 2201.839
uh

3455.68 --> 3457.9199999999996
right

3458.48 --> 3463.839

3540.16 --> 3544.96

3542.559 --> 3547.8390000000004
to be surrounded by mud and [ __ ]

3544.96 --> 3549.68

likely no it's just that everything

3602.799 --> 3606.839
about it is just hard

water related engineering there's going

3764.48 --> 3768.64
to be dutch people involved they kind of

3766.319 --> 3769.599
made it their business to do that their

3768.64 --> 3772.16
field

3769.599 --> 3772.1600000000003
a lot of them

3776.799 --> 3782.119
it's an accuracy yeah i know gorzilla

3787.28 --> 3791.2000000000003
and it is a pretty

3790.24 --> 3794.24
like

3791.2 --> 3796.64
fractal message also it's like

3794.24 --> 3798.72
just to make you aware like because what

3796.64 --> 3800.0789999999997
the hell is the supposed mark of the

3798.72 --> 3802.16
beast

3800.079 --> 3804.1600000000003
got descriptions we got endless

3802.16 --> 3805.68
fantasies and suggestions like this is

3804.16 --> 3806.96
the market reason that is the market

3805.68 --> 3809.839
that and that

3806.96 --> 3812.48
oh i think the mark of the beast is

3809.839 --> 3815.599
spiritual it's not actually physical

3812.48 --> 3817.44
it's a spiritual mark

3815.599 --> 3819.839
that's what i think and i think that

3817.44 --> 3822.4
marxism is

3819.839 --> 3824.4
that mark

3822.4 --> 3826.4
it's the things you do the objectives

3824.4 --> 3829.44
what that you sacrifice everything you

3826.4 --> 3833.2000000000003
sacrifice meaning itself

3829.44 --> 3836.319
or like this undead victory

3833.2 --> 3838.0789999999997
it is the mark of the beast marxism

3836.319 --> 3840.64
itself

3838.079 --> 3841.92
and all of these marxists that are like

3840.64 --> 3845.839
in history

3841.92 --> 3846.7200000000003
they all like virtue signal to satan

3845.839 --> 3849.2
even

3846.72 --> 3850.48
they literally do that

3849.2 --> 3854.0789999999997
you understand

3850.48 --> 3857.28
it is the mark

3854.079 --> 3857.28
marxism itself

3857.92 --> 3863.359
and you can only take it

3861.119 --> 3863.359
right

3865.119 --> 3868.88
you can't really be forced into it

3867.2 --> 3871.2
although yeah you can be basically

3868.88 --> 3872.4
deprived of a normal life so that it

3871.2 --> 3874.48
will be more

3872.4 --> 3877.44
seemingly appealing to you to choose

3874.48 --> 3880.88
that which would be a dire mistake

3877.44 --> 3883.2000000000003
but yeah the conditions right but it is

3880.88 --> 3885.599
always a choice

3883.2 --> 3885.5989999999997
anyway

3886.24 --> 3891.359
that's kind of where that came from

3888.799 --> 3891.359
the title

3891.599 --> 3895.559
thanks for addressing it

3909.039 --> 3911.3590000000004
hmm

3914.16 --> 3920.1189999999997
yep gordzilla that's pretty much hits

3916.559 --> 3920.119
the nail on the head

3924.43 --> 3927.5899999999997
[Music]

3965.46 --> 3969.03
[Music]

3984.319 --> 3988.72
the netherlands are cool yeah

3987.44 --> 3992.119
it's

3988.72 --> 3992.1189999999997
it's all right

3992.16 --> 3998.319
we got a big like liberal toxicity

3995.599 --> 3998.319
problem though

4003.599 --> 4009.92
let's just say there's a lot of jews

4006.96 --> 4012.16
here that are being put to the test

4009.92 --> 4013.359
naturally

4012.16 --> 4015.44
through everything that's happening

4013.359 --> 4016.72
they're really being put to the test

4015.44 --> 4018.799
like

4016.72 --> 4021.359
where's your loyalty

4018.799 --> 4023.839
right where's your loyalty really is it

4021.359 --> 4026.88
to just power

4023.839 --> 4029.2
the craziness of some elite

4026.88 --> 4030.799
or is it real like what is it you're

4029.2 --> 4032.16
really loyal to

4030.799 --> 4034.24
jew

4032.16 --> 4036.3999999999996
right

4034.24 --> 4039.52
i just get this feeling

4036.4 --> 4042.319
like there's so much testing going on

4039.52 --> 4043.599
right now psychological

4042.319 --> 4047.079
moral

4043.599 --> 4047.079
here in the netherlands

4061.839 --> 4063.92
you

4078.88 --> 4082.7200000000003
right

4080.96 --> 4085.28
by the way yeah i hope you got out of

4082.72 --> 4088.0
that i'm not like oh it's all the jews

4085.28 --> 4089.8390000000004
it's all them no

4088.0 --> 4092.559
just saying there seem to be a lot of

4089.839 --> 4096.3189999999995
them here and it

4092.559 --> 4098.4800000000005
it's been like that it's just like

4096.319 --> 4101.4400000000005
we have jews

4098.48 --> 4103.04
here in the netherlands

4101.44 --> 4106.719
and there's mixed feelings about that

4103.04 --> 4106.719
but overall it's been kind of a

4108.159 --> 4114.0
a decent balance i guess but yeah in

4111.199 --> 4117.44
this media age yeah we've had

4114.0 --> 4119.759
major liberal squirt effects because of

4117.44 --> 4123.759
it

4119.759 --> 4127.199
right not like the the aggressive

4123.759 --> 4129.44
fanaticism and violence like for example

4127.199 --> 4132.0
in some places in the usa where this

4129.44 --> 4133.12
red's really bad right we don't have

4132.0 --> 4135.839
that

4133.12 --> 4138.799
but there's a lot of indoctrination

4135.839 --> 4143.3189999999995
happening in general here

4138.799 --> 4143.319
media wise with liberalism

4147.92 --> 4154.319
and yeah that's kind of their thing it's

4152.319 --> 4156.400000000001
they're just being trendy

4154.319 --> 4161.159000000001
way in over their heads right right

4156.4 --> 4161.159
that's that's how i kind of see it

4164.88 --> 4169.92
but yeah there is a lot of information

4167.279 --> 4171.4400000000005
going around there's still

4169.92 --> 4173.6
i mean

4171.44 --> 4174.799
it's not like everything is censored

4173.6 --> 4177.52
here

4174.799 --> 4177.5199999999995
not like that

4179.569 --> 4183.6
[Music]

4180.88 --> 4185.279
it's just that in the mainstream you

4183.6 --> 4187.120000000001
can't really get

4185.279 --> 4188.64
you can't get your foot in between that

4187.12 --> 4190.4
door you just

4188.64 --> 4191.92
if you're not going to be

4190.4 --> 4194.4
a liberal

4191.92 --> 4196.64
liberal then they're just like no like

4194.4 --> 4199.639999999999
you're not welcome you're just a

4196.64 --> 4199.64
outsider

4217.04 --> 4219.92
huh interesting

4225.6 --> 4229.120000000001
that sounds like it's an older movie

4227.36 --> 4230.5599999999995
logical conclusion

4229.12 --> 4233.44
i mean there's been

4230.56 --> 4236.400000000001
there was a lot of

4233.44 --> 4238.5599999999995
interesting liberal developments

4236.4 --> 4240.4
in the 20th century here

4238.56 --> 4241.679
that were

4240.4 --> 4245.04
arguably

4241.679 --> 4248.159
okay like good

4245.04 --> 4249.76
decent liberals not like overly like oh

4248.159 --> 4252.5599999999995
we're gonna tear

4249.76 --> 4254.320000000001
the norms apart not marxist

4252.56 --> 4256.56
right and there's been like a lot of

4254.32 --> 4261.599999999999
movies dutch movies and all kinds of

4256.56 --> 4261.6
directions and yeah not bad i mean

4263.84 --> 4269.04
the netherlands was definitely there

4267.12 --> 4270.84
i still try to be but it's just they're

4269.04 --> 4274.239
they're so liberal now

4270.84 --> 4276.32
it's yeah they've been poisoned along

4274.239 --> 4279.599999999999
with everything else out there

4276.32 --> 4279.599999999999
that's on that frequency

4279.76 --> 4285.12
but there is still a struggle going on

4282.48 --> 4287.44
spiritually overall

4285.12 --> 4289.5199999999995
there's just a lot of animal

4287.44 --> 4291.12
from the grass roots you could say from

4289.52 --> 4293.4400000000005
the people in general it's always been

4291.12 --> 4296.239
there that spirit like like we really

4293.44 --> 4296.239
don't want this

4297.52 --> 4301.76
like we're not going to just

4299.6 --> 4304.96
roll over to this we're not weak we're

4301.76 --> 4308.56
dutch we're not actually weak

4304.96 --> 4308.56
and even like people that

4308.64 --> 4314.2390000000005
wanted to come and live here migrants or

4311.12 --> 4316.719
whatever right even a lot of them

4314.239 --> 4319.759999999999
understand that

4316.719 --> 4319.76
like they get it

4321.199 --> 4326.719
like we're all here together and we

4324.4 --> 4328.5599999999995
we're being psychologically attacked by

4326.719 --> 4330.8
the beast

4328.56 --> 4333.52
in a way and we're all trying to deal

4330.8 --> 4335.4400000000005
with this trying to figure it out

4333.52 --> 4337.76
yeah

4335.44 --> 4341.0
you think of everyone's you i don't know

4337.76 --> 4341.0
jim west

4344.64 --> 4350.08
become liberal no let's not then win

4347.28 --> 4350.08
it's not the time

4350.32 --> 4355.5199999999995
i mean liberalism needs to be detoxed it

4353.44 --> 4357.04
needs to be detoxified

4355.52 --> 4359.360000000001
if that's even possible they're all

4357.04 --> 4360.96
going nuts

4359.36 --> 4364.08
they've taken it too far they're

4360.96 --> 4365.199
basically bad tripping

4364.08 --> 4366.96
and

4365.199 --> 4368.48
we they don't want to come out of that

4366.96 --> 4370.719
bad trip

4368.48 --> 4373.5199999999995
they're just obsessed now with

4370.719 --> 4376.32
winning and dominating it with a devil

4373.52 --> 4377.360000000001
spirit a demon

4376.32 --> 4379.679
and they're

4377.36 --> 4381.04
forgone they've thrown off the

4379.679 --> 4383.6
subtleties

4381.04 --> 4384.56
and the values that they actually held

4383.6 --> 4386.96
they

4384.56 --> 4388.96
thrown it away

4386.96 --> 4392.2390000000005
right and a lot of people in general

4388.96 --> 4392.2390000000005
don't agree with that

4396.88 --> 4402.400000000001
we don't want to be part of some

4399.199 --> 4405.28
corruption club that has disdain for

4402.4 --> 4407.839999999999
humanity and underestimates people

4405.28 --> 4410.639999999999
constantly

4407.84 --> 4411.84
just turns them into numbers to be

4410.64 --> 4414.2390000000005
erased

4411.84 --> 4417.84
from the board

4414.239 --> 4417.839999999999
we don't like that

4418.0 --> 4421.6
we have a lot of faith

4420.08 --> 4423.12
like in

4421.6 --> 4425.280000000001
in just

4423.12 --> 4428.5599999999995
people in general that they have

4425.28 --> 4432.5599999999995
potential that they have talents and

4428.56 --> 4432.56
that that's just a dutch thing

4432.96 --> 4439.28
i think i think that's very dutch

4436.8 --> 4442.2390000000005
i'm not sure i mean yeah i that this is

4439.28 --> 4443.5199999999995
where i grew up i don't know

4442.239 --> 4445.36
if that's

4443.52 --> 4448.400000000001
there might be a lot of places out there

4445.36 --> 4448.4
where it's the same

4448.88 --> 4452.6
this is what i experienced

4454.08 --> 4458.88
like there's enough good energy that we

4456.08 --> 4461.36
just we don't want to let see

4458.88 --> 4463.76
everything get corrupted we just don't

4461.36 --> 4466.08
like that we don't

4463.76 --> 4468.400000000001
we can't turn a blind eye to a blind eye

4466.08 --> 4470.48
to that we might not know exactly how to

4468.4 --> 4472.32
deal with it all

4470.48 --> 4475.5199999999995
but we're not going to turn the blind to

4472.32 --> 4475.5199999999995
it typically the dutch

4480.8 --> 4485.4400000000005
very awakened like that and i'm happy

4483.28 --> 4487.679
about that i like that that

4485.44 --> 4489.919999999999
is the thing i like about the dutch is

4487.679 --> 4489.92
that

4492.719 --> 4499.92
they do catch on pretty quickly compared

4496.48 --> 4499.919999999999
to other people

4500.239 --> 4505.44
i like that about them

4502.56 --> 4507.76
it also makes our politician much worse

4505.44 --> 4509.599999999999
though because they're like the ultimate

4507.76 --> 4513.04
savonier

4509.6 --> 4516.08
just wizards constantly red-hairing and

4513.04 --> 4518.4
like like a master like we got like the

4516.08 --> 4520.239
most terrible politicians really it is

4518.4 --> 4523.12
like

4520.239 --> 4525.839999999999
i mean seriously guys

4523.12 --> 4528.88
i mean american politics is like pretty

4525.84 --> 4532.400000000001
atrocious right by now it is like gross

4528.88 --> 4535.04
and idiotic and total nonsense

4532.4 --> 4538.159
well our politicians here are terrible

4535.04 --> 4541.04
but more subtle and just nasty and just

4538.159 --> 4544.48
lying and with a smile on their face

4541.04 --> 4547.12
really going for gaslighting you right

4544.48 --> 4548.159
it is terrible here it is really

4547.12 --> 4550.719
terrible

4548.159 --> 4552.639999999999
like sometimes when i watch like videos

4550.719 --> 4554.96
where there's stuff in like the

4552.64 --> 4557.84
cabinet going and talking like i'm

4554.96 --> 4557.84
sitting here like

4558.8 --> 4564.320000000001
oh it's so painful

4562.239 --> 4566.959999999999
i don't even have that when i watch like

4564.32 --> 4570.0
american politics or anything it's just

4566.96 --> 4572.08
like oh so stupid right

4570.0 --> 4574.0
but it doesn't like attack you

4572.08 --> 4576.88
spiritually it's not

4574.0 --> 4579.36
sophisticated enough to do that it's

4576.88 --> 4580.400000000001
it's almost burned out

4579.36 --> 4585.36
the netherlands

4580.4 --> 4585.36
is terrible that it's terrible

4585.44 --> 4589.599999999999
like what what they do how they play the

4588.4 --> 4592.96
game

4589.6 --> 4595.120000000001
on the liberal side terrible what they

4592.96 --> 4597.36
do it's really painful to sit through

4595.12 --> 4597.36
that

4597.52 --> 4602.56
because it's more subtle because it's

4600.48 --> 4604.159
actually thought through

4602.56 --> 4605.92
and engineered

4604.159 --> 4609.44
carefully

4605.92 --> 4612.32
and that just makes it even more painful

4609.44 --> 4614.08
so yeah we we got we catch on typical

4612.32 --> 4616.88
but our politicians

4614.08 --> 4619.679
thus also tend to catch on a bit more

4616.88 --> 4623.84
and thus become more terrible so it

4619.679 --> 4623.84
definitely has a downside

4626.56 --> 4630.719
could say the same about their poland

4628.239 --> 4630.718999999999
yeah but

4634.32 --> 4639.5199999999995
i mean if you're dutch you're probably

4635.92 --> 4639.52
gonna get what i'm saying right now

4646.4 --> 4650.92
yeah some are worse than others

4647.92 --> 4650.92
definitely

4655.04 --> 4660.0
maybe it's like just as bad as that in

4657.679 --> 4661.84
in germany i don't know i don't speak

4660.0 --> 4663.679
german so i can't really follow the

4661.84 --> 4666.64
subtle details when i see a video like

4663.679 --> 4668.8
that and thus don't typically hang

4666.64 --> 4670.08
around to actually watch it

4668.8 --> 4671.76
so i have less

4670.08 --> 4674.159
impressions

4671.76 --> 4678.08
but it seems on the surface kind of like

4674.159 --> 4680.239
just as terrible but

4678.08 --> 4683.76
just that these dutch

4680.239 --> 4685.839999999999
liberal politicians with wef and all

4683.76 --> 4689.12
that [ __ ]

4685.84 --> 4690.56
they're just really refined in their

4689.12 --> 4694.239
evil

4690.56 --> 4695.6
they are really refined

4694.239 --> 4697.919999999999
and i

4695.6 --> 4700.320000000001
i'm not sure if other

4697.92 --> 4702.8
liberal politicians in other countries

4700.32 --> 4707.0
really achieve it to that level

4702.8 --> 4707.0
or if they just kind of stumble

4708.56 --> 4710.96
anyway

4712.96 --> 4716.08
irish politicians are no better over

4714.8 --> 4718.84
there

4716.08 --> 4722.96
but they're irish that's

4718.84 --> 4724.719
yeah i mean they're irish it

4722.96 --> 4727.04
works very differently with the irish

4724.719 --> 4727.04
people

4728.64 --> 4732.56
but yeah i haven't heard a lot of good

4730.48 --> 4735.5199999999995
things i heard that there's been a lot

4732.56 --> 4737.84
of liberalization

4735.52 --> 4743.159000000001
that nobody really agrees to

4737.84 --> 4743.159000000001
in in ireland in the last few decades

4750.239 --> 4756.5199999999995
better than the taliban no dan you don't

4752.719 --> 4756.52
know what you're talking about

4782.8 --> 4786.04
come on

4799.52 --> 4804.84
because she seems less likely yeah

4801.36 --> 4804.839999999999
because they are

4819.28 --> 4824.239
right yeah that that's right right then

4822.159 --> 4826.48
russia has effectively maneuvered

4824.239 --> 4830.32
towards

4826.48 --> 4832.879999999999
more of an old liberal style position

4830.32 --> 4834.48
like a 20th century style liberal that's

4832.88 --> 4837.84
kind of like where he's maneuvering

4834.48 --> 4839.199
while at the same time still being very

4837.84 --> 4842.2390000000005
strong

4839.199 --> 4845.5599999999995
it's like that's

4842.239 --> 4845.5599999999995
pretty remarkable

4848.8 --> 4851.360000000001
and yeah

4855.6 --> 4860.96
like i have confidence

4858.08 --> 4862.32
in in russia and the russian people and

4860.96 --> 4864.32
and how they're dealing with this

4862.32 --> 4867.28
situation i have a lot of confidence in

4864.32 --> 4867.28
them right now

4868.719 --> 4871.36
and i think that

4870.4 --> 4872.839999999999
yeah

4871.36 --> 4877.04
statements i've made

4872.84 --> 4878.56
earlier like months ago when yeah

4877.04 --> 4880.8
earlier this year

4878.56 --> 4882.8
i think i called it like completely when

4880.8 --> 4885.12
everybody was still like oh no this and

4882.8 --> 4887.360000000001
that and i'm like no no they're just

4885.12 --> 4889.679
gonna win i know where they are like

4887.36 --> 4891.199
they can't not win

4889.679 --> 4894.08
with everything that's involved they

4891.199 --> 4896.08
just can't not win it's

4894.08 --> 4897.84
they're gonna do it

4896.08 --> 4899.92
and even now

4897.84 --> 4902.96
i've been hearing that like even like

4899.92 --> 4904.159
these weird chrome the old crones from

4902.96 --> 4906.2390000000005
the

4904.159 --> 4908.48
from the dark round table and all that

4906.239 --> 4910.718999999999
henry kissinger and

4908.48 --> 4912.5599999999995
that even they're like now starting to

4910.719 --> 4915.04
object and all that

4912.56 --> 4915.04
to like

4915.199 --> 4919.759999999999
like supporting ukraine it's really like

4917.92 --> 4922.2390000000005
whoa what what

4919.76 --> 4924.639
what's going on there

4922.239 --> 4928.159
are they actually starting to catch on

4924.639 --> 4928.159000000001
that this was a bad idea

4928.8 --> 4932.400000000001
you'd almost think so

4941.28 --> 4945.12
it would be yeah no [ __ ] sherlock i mean

4943.76 --> 4947.76
come on

4945.12 --> 4951.12
it's not like come on

4947.76 --> 4951.12
it's ridiculous like

4954.8 --> 4961.1990000000005
like why why would they do that

4958.32 --> 4964.159
it's ridiculous it's terrible idea for

4961.199 --> 4964.159
finland to do that

4969.28 --> 4974.5599999999995
i mean the only reason i could imagine

4972.159 --> 4977.04
why that would work is if they decided

4974.56 --> 4980.400000000001
to basically go mercenary got a huge

4977.04 --> 4983.36
amount of money to just basically be

4980.4 --> 4984.48
a proxy now

4983.36 --> 4987.839999999999
right

4984.48 --> 4987.839999999999
on that border

4990.639 --> 4996.32
like what's the long-term benefit is

4992.719 --> 4998.32
there really any long-term benefit there

4996.32 --> 5001.599999999999
i don't think so i think that finland's

4998.32 --> 5003.759999999999
gonna like really

5001.6 --> 5006.56
just kind of get

5003.76 --> 5009.92
rolled over and closed in

5006.56 --> 5013.4800000000005
like they're not really gonna

5009.92 --> 5013.4800000000005
turn the tide

5016.8 --> 5021.52
turkey might reject finland membership

5018.8 --> 5021.52
really okay

5027.76 --> 5032.2390000000005
uh now the best thing that could really

5029.76 --> 5035.4400000000005
happen at this point is that nato would

5032.239 --> 5035.44
be disbanded

5040.32 --> 5042.799999999999
and then

5041.28 --> 5045.12
yeah

5042.8 --> 5048.0
let's get around the table

5045.12 --> 5050.639
honestly hopefully without liberal

5048.0 --> 5053.04
freaks doing what they typically do

5050.639 --> 5055.6
let's kick them out

5053.04 --> 5057.84
of these discussions and actually form a

5055.6 --> 5058.88
new

5057.84 --> 5061.12
group

5058.88 --> 5062.96
to balance it out with different

5061.12 --> 5065.84
objectives and

5062.96 --> 5065.84
more checks

5066.32 --> 5069.84
so that this can't really happen like

5068.159 --> 5072.08
this again that they can't that's not

5069.84 --> 5075.12
just another new

5072.08 --> 5079.719
machine that that's prone to do like

5075.12 --> 5079.719
political abuse like this

5084.18 --> 5088.75
[Music]

5093.43 --> 5096.8
[Music]

5095.44 --> 5099.839999999999
all right i'm going to take two minute

5096.8 --> 5099.84
break we'll be right back

5204.08 --> 5207.08
hmm

5214.32 --> 5219.36
yeah i'm a few whole people seem to be

5216.239 --> 5221.44
in a very weird mood today

5219.36 --> 5223.36
fine i guess it's one of those days i'm

5221.44 --> 5224.96
not gonna

5223.36 --> 5226.28
keep

5224.96 --> 5227.76
whipping you

5226.28 --> 5231.88
[Music]

5227.76 --> 5235.01
i'm a bit fuzzy too today so

5231.88 --> 5235.01
[Music]

5237.96 --> 5241.21
[Music]

5265.36 --> 5269.28
right but anyway there's there are

5267.44 --> 5270.719
things happening out there apparently i

5269.28 --> 5273.12
mean

5270.719 --> 5275.679
i do always pay attention to when

5273.12 --> 5278.48
individuals like

5275.679 --> 5281.36
henry kissinger or even what's the other

5278.48 --> 5283.599999999999
guy

5281.36 --> 5285.679
all these old crones

5283.6 --> 5289.52
that specific

5285.679 --> 5292.0
category when they start to like

5289.52 --> 5292.0
counter

5292.08 --> 5296.159
things that are being done by the beast

5293.92 --> 5297.84
because that's always interesting when

5296.159 --> 5300.4
that happens

5297.84 --> 5302.32
they never just randomly do something

5300.4 --> 5305.36
like that

5302.32 --> 5307.599999999999
so just interesting so i am gonna like

5305.36 --> 5309.5199999999995
keep a bit of a lookout what's what's

5307.6 --> 5312.8
gonna happen

5309.52 --> 5315.120000000001
it might all just like literally

5312.8 --> 5315.12
stop

5318.719 --> 5326.32
right they might the the ukraine project

5321.84 --> 5326.32
as it were might literally be abandoned

5326.88 --> 5333.36
that's my suspicion this might happen

5330.4 --> 5335.679
would be probably better for everybody

5333.36 --> 5337.839999999999
because it's just a completely senseless

5335.679 --> 5337.84
war

5338.8 --> 5343.76
and russia is absolutely contractually

5341.44 --> 5345.759999999999
in the right and there's nothing that

5343.76 --> 5347.76
that yeah the

5345.76 --> 5350.320000000001
the crones and the new world order

5347.76 --> 5354.96
people and

5350.32 --> 5354.96
the american liberals can do about it

5356.639 --> 5359.84
hey the other mikin

5360.56 --> 5365.84
was it a good idea for the uk to leave

5362.88 --> 5365.84
the eu

5367.92 --> 5370.2390000000005
yeah

5368.8 --> 5372.08
i guess

5370.239 --> 5374.32
in ways it was

5372.08 --> 5377.199
definitely

5374.32 --> 5379.679
i mean the the eu is not getting any

5377.199 --> 5382.239
better

5379.679 --> 5384.88
if you know what i mean

5382.239 --> 5386.718999999999
the eu might also at some point just

5384.88 --> 5390.08
scatter

5386.719 --> 5393.52
because of what's going down right now

5390.08 --> 5396.96
it's a mess and they are pushing more

5393.52 --> 5398.88
unelected bureaucracy on everybody and

5396.96 --> 5400.88
nobody wants it

5398.88 --> 5401.84
and we're like getting really sick of it

5400.88 --> 5405.96
now

5401.84 --> 5405.96
most people in europe

5423.679 --> 5427.84
maybe

5424.639 --> 5427.84
tony not sure

5427.92 --> 5431.639
i think probably

5438.96 --> 5443.84
i do remember there's one dutch guy that

5440.96 --> 5443.84
did do that

5444.8 --> 5448.320000000001
got pretty heavy

5446.8 --> 5449.92
so that's probably the one you're

5448.32 --> 5450.96
talking about right now yeah i did see

5449.92 --> 5451.63
that

5450.96 --> 5454.0
i think

5451.63 --> 5456.88
[Music]

5454.0 --> 5461.0
maybe the uk is the start of the breakup

5456.88 --> 5461.0
of the uk no

5468.88 --> 5472.08
od

5469.76 --> 5472.08
right

5472.96 --> 5478.08
well maybe

5474.88 --> 5481.12
maybe i mean it it didn't like

5478.08 --> 5483.04
immediately trigger it from falling

5481.12 --> 5484.5599999999995
apart

5483.04 --> 5486.88
but it is

5484.56 --> 5490.080000000001
it did happen and

5486.88 --> 5492.2390000000005
it at least showed that it's possible

5490.08 --> 5496.08
right

5492.239 --> 5499.28
it it set a precedent like yeah it they

5496.08 --> 5500.639
can actually leave and that part is kind

5499.28 --> 5503.44
of good

5500.639 --> 5504.8
because that means that yeah

5503.44 --> 5507.28
there might be a little bit more

5504.8 --> 5509.360000000001
confidence by other parties involved to

5507.28 --> 5511.5199999999995
also separate that at least it's

5509.36 --> 5513.92
possible

5511.52 --> 5516.2390000000005
right i kind of want the netherlands to

5513.92 --> 5519.84
separate but

5516.239 --> 5519.839999999999
good luck with that

5521.28 --> 5526.44
he got like heavy investors and all that

5554.82 --> 5558.009999999999
[Music]

5573.32 --> 5577.8099999999995
[Music]

5580.67 --> 5583.909
[Music]

5620.48 --> 5625.08
anyway indeed godzilla

5631.6 --> 5637.84
but china no

5633.92 --> 5637.84
no china is china

5638.08 --> 5644.199
so now but there's the jews is still

5640.96 --> 5644.199
right there

5645.04 --> 5649.84
nobody took over for them they're still

5647.28 --> 5652.4
doing what they do

5649.84 --> 5655.28
that china is just

5652.4 --> 5656.638999999999
doing its own thing but it is

5655.28 --> 5659.84
poised to

5656.639 --> 5659.84
collapse at some point

5661.6 --> 5666.56
they're just

5663.6 --> 5669.04
being too evil

5666.56 --> 5669.04
in ways

5669.36 --> 5673.839999999999
which in my opinion is completely

5671.36 --> 5673.839999999999
unnecessary

5674.0 --> 5677.04
they're just doing it

5677.36 --> 5682.96
so they have like their own

5680.639 --> 5685.4400000000005
issues that are kind of reflecting of

5682.96 --> 5686.4800000000005
what's going on here in europe and

5685.44 --> 5687.759999999999
america

5686.48 --> 5692.28
just as well

5687.76 --> 5692.280000000001
but they have it internally it just

5700.96 --> 5705.04
i mean at some point it's like the

5703.04 --> 5708.159
spirit of control that's driving all

5705.04 --> 5710.639
that over there it's going to break

5708.159 --> 5713.28
like it's going to break

5710.639 --> 5717.28
the spirit of china and the energy

5713.28 --> 5719.199
source that basically feed every person

5717.28 --> 5722.08
they're gonna break it and then they're

5719.199 --> 5726.0
gonna collapse and then

5722.08 --> 5727.679
it's just gonna be giant riots and then

5726.0 --> 5730.32
dead ccp

5727.679 --> 5730.32
everywhere

5730.96 --> 5735.96
if they

5731.92 --> 5735.96
if they keep pushing this

5755.84 --> 5761.52
when you see jewelry no

5759.04 --> 5761.5199999999995
i'm not

5769.52 --> 5775.719
all right see you later gordzilla

5771.84 --> 5775.719
thanks for popping by

5856.4 --> 5861.199
not like what the hell does that have to

5858.08 --> 5861.199
do with anything he said

5863.119 --> 5866.48
oh

5864.159 --> 5868.239
lead to back to rome

5866.48 --> 5871.48
what does that have to do with religion

5868.239 --> 5871.48
in politics

5909.76 --> 5912.639
the vatican

5914.0 --> 5918.159
okay

5915.199 --> 5919.839999999999
yeah fair enough

5918.159 --> 5921.199
i hadn't actually thought about it like

5919.84 --> 5923.04
that

5921.199 --> 5925.839999999999
i was just thinking of the general

5923.04 --> 5927.199
saying or roads lead back to rome but i

5925.84 --> 5929.52
guess that

5927.199 --> 5932.5599999999995
that could be

5929.52 --> 5934.8
perceived as actually a covert sign like

5932.56 --> 5938.2390000000005
yeah because of the vatican which is

5934.8 --> 5940.4800000000005
there in rome

5938.239 --> 5942.08
but that's like kind of an esoteric

5940.48 --> 5944.32
interpretation of that kind of

5942.08 --> 5947.92
generalized saying

5944.32 --> 5948.799999999999
as like it's just like a central point

5947.92 --> 5950.719
like

5948.8 --> 5955.0
across roads

5950.719 --> 5955.0
on the map sort of

5977.52 --> 5984.4800000000005
man i'm really really freaking hungry

5981.84 --> 5986.639

5984.48 --> 5988.159
