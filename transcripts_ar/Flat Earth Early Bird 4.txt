fluent conversation I'm not so good at

94.209 --> 104.529
it on my own unfortunately lo flatlander

99.119 --> 108.119
so please please come and join the show

104.529 --> 110.859
oh yeah sorry by the way for being late

108.119 --> 115.6
this early bird was a little bit late

110.859 --> 118.029
today so I was a very late night and I

115.6 --> 121.749
ate very late and that was probably due

118.029 --> 124.209
and the reason that I slept really

121.749 --> 127.67999999999999
really late tends to happen I shouldn't

124.209 --> 130.869
be eating like after a certain point

127.68 --> 133.06
after midnight and I did anyway because

130.869 --> 136.81
I was just really hungry and I watched

133.06 --> 139.15
movie which happened to be a Birdman

136.81 --> 141.7
it's very funny concerning the title of

139.15 --> 144.81900000000002
the show but yeah I was a really really

141.7 --> 148.72
really good movie but about Broadway

144.819 --> 153.67
basically and was fascinating that's in

148.72 --> 155.05
any good movie yeah it's really fresh

153.67 --> 159.099
probably gonna watch it again at some

155.05 --> 166.60000000000002
point definitely recommended it's very

159.099 --> 167.29
interesting and what jumped out the most

166.6 --> 170.88
to me

167.29 --> 175.62
besides the overall quality and style

170.88 --> 179.47
was that there was no politicization of

175.62 --> 182.14000000000001
any kind in this movie which is rather

179.47 --> 185.44
surprising consider it is a Hollywood

182.14 --> 188.23
movie and they would tell her normally

185.44 --> 190.45
typically throw in a lot of liberal

188.23 --> 193.01899999999998
elements in there just liberal

190.45 --> 195.459
characters that that kind of thing like

193.019 --> 197.56
not that I have problem with it but for

195.459 --> 202.54
example like really gay people would

197.56 --> 206.2
typically be in in this type of movie

202.54 --> 208.42
Broadway movies and well there might

206.2 --> 210.51899999999998
have been like gay individuals in there

208.42 --> 213.25
but they didn't really like stand out in

210.519 --> 215.89000000000001
lots being gay or anything so it was

213.25 --> 217.81
just not about that was just really

215.89 --> 220.17999999999998
about Broadway about the main character

217.81 --> 223.359
and I liked it a lot it's very very

220.18 --> 227.459
impressed that's the kind of movies you

223.359 --> 230.019
want to see how Hollywood just technical

227.459 --> 231.93
masterpieces with great great acting and

230.019 --> 238.26
great story

231.93 --> 243.359
so yeah I was very pleasantly surprised

238.26 --> 243.35899999999998
and we're still without a guest here

248.65 --> 256.949
now what can I talk about on my own

250.84 --> 262.93
let's see what was going on yesterday

256.949 --> 266.53000000000003
besides the debates movie I know there's

262.93 --> 269.83
a lot going on it's always been a bit

266.53 --> 271.38899999999995
hard to keep track of it all like after

269.83 --> 276.03999999999996
the first year because then things

271.389 --> 278.08
became so wide so many people I just

276.04 --> 280.72
can't keep track of it all and yeah you

278.08 --> 282.90999999999997
need a real knack for that to be able to

280.72 --> 285.699
do that like Mark sergeant and Patricia

282.91 --> 290.11
steer they really really keep track I

285.699 --> 293.5
I'm not that good at that so for me it's

290.11 --> 295.84000000000003
just whatever bumps into me whatever I

293.5 --> 298.57
come across whenever YouTube suggests

295.84 --> 302.34999999999997
that catches my attention or whatever

298.57 --> 305.639
a fellow flat earther will bring up or

302.35 --> 309.91
if it happens to pop up on the

305.639 --> 312.01
alternative news cycle but yeah not a

309.91 --> 313.96000000000004
lot of flyers to relay the things to be

312.01 --> 317.83
found there although there's a lot of

313.96 --> 320.73999999999995
funny NASA related stories that do is

317.83 --> 322.96
spread around daily weird suggestions

320.74 --> 325.33
and everything that's always fun

322.96 --> 330.25
but yeah when it comes to Flat Earth I

325.33 --> 337.44899999999996
really have to get it a man to man or a

330.25 --> 339.82
woman woman to man and well I did keep

337.449 --> 342.789
keep a little up today but usually a

339.82 --> 345.099
little bit afterwards so I'm not like oh

342.789 --> 347.26
yeah this happened right now this

345.099 --> 350.349
happened yesterday I'll probably find

347.26 --> 354.88
out like at least the day after or maybe

350.349 --> 357.55
weeks after sometimes YouTube just after

354.88 --> 360.12
a video I'm watching will make me jump

357.55 --> 362.979
to another video that's been like

360.12 --> 365.169
produced a half a year ago that I've

362.979 --> 367.33
never seen before in the end it will it

365.169 --> 370.51
turned out turns out to be really good

367.33 --> 374.289
or even relevant to discussions it's

370.51 --> 378.19
funny to see the earlier perspectives on

374.289 --> 380.229
certain issues that we've now dealt with

378.19 --> 382.759
and progressed with and just see how

380.229 --> 385.729
people responded to that early

382.759 --> 387.44
when we haven't figured it out yet and

385.729 --> 392.15
that's really fascinating to me as well

387.44 --> 396.169
to just see like where were we back then

392.15 --> 399.979
and how did we approach new grounds it's

396.169 --> 403.19
just fascinating to see how our minds

399.979 --> 410.46999999999997
respond to this and how we develop find

403.19 --> 413.57
it fascinating anyway come on guys still

410.47 --> 426.77000000000004
some one-man show this way I need some

413.57 --> 431.0

talk on my own but nothing very super

521.569 --> 529.9699999999999
interesting

523.93 --> 532.819
Jose yesterday I called a mr. Jaime

529.97 --> 535.339
Brown it been he's been sending for a

532.819 --> 539.24
while he had a he got the hangouts and

535.339 --> 541.0100000000001
he got like personal you know he sent

539.24 --> 543.35
links to people that he throws and they

541.01 --> 546.079
join him and they she chat and he

543.35 --> 547.61
everybody the ballers are celebrating

546.079 --> 550.819
because they say he went back to the

547.61 --> 553.5790000000001
globe coming actually he titled the the

550.819 --> 556.579
show like after all I think earth is a

553.579 --> 560.0
globe and he didn't look to the shot and

556.579 --> 563.959
he did a long speech he sounded sane he

560.0 --> 567.29
sounded decent but the arguments yeah he

563.959 --> 569.3599999999999
say he I don't know he's tired of

567.29 --> 571.819
Florida and he everything works in the

569.36 --> 573.8290000000001
globe and he might continue doing the

571.819 --> 576.55
shows he might not so keep in touch he

573.829 --> 582.91
say yeah and everybody like boo yeah

576.55 --> 585.4699999999999
maybe it is awesome fatigue you know I

582.91 --> 587.51
had moments to where I thought like oh

585.47 --> 589.22
I'm I'm kind of sick of this Oh

587.51 --> 592.34
I want to get out like do something

589.22 --> 594.08
entirely new get away from it all it's

592.34 --> 597.89
not because of Flat Earth but just

594.08 --> 600.95
because of the social setup and all the

597.89 --> 603.86
things that you ineptly

600.95 --> 606.6800000000001
and it revoke ibly get involved with

603.86 --> 609.13
basically on social level but yeah I

606.68 --> 613.91
would never then say okay I'm gonna

609.13 --> 616.55
refer guys I'm a glue over now and cuz I

613.91 --> 620.0
would be sick of it now I just said look

616.55 --> 623.4499999999999
guys you know it's still very conflicted

620.0 --> 627.01
I I have my doubts maybe and I'm just

623.45 --> 630.0200000000001
gonna retract for a while to to recharge

627.01 --> 632.6899999999999
that's what I what I was it's

630.02 --> 634.46
understandable yeah I I feel you I feel

632.69 --> 638.3900000000001
like this actually many days pretty much

634.46 --> 640.94
apply right now I say sometimes like in

638.39 --> 642.71
what do I get myself into in the first

640.94 --> 644.8100000000001
place when I look in the Flat Earth and

642.71 --> 647.3000000000001
I took it so seriously I'm too personal

644.81 --> 650.3
you know try to research this and I

647.3 --> 652.25
started with the just shutting in the

650.3 --> 654.17
shows and say hi and getting shoutouts

652.25 --> 658.7
until I've been in pretty much Nate and

654.17 --> 660.9799999999999
almost daily I do like this the debate

658.7 --> 662.84
format I cannot debate personally but I

660.98 --> 666.35
love the debate and I love love

662.84 --> 668.12
answering asking questions and figuring

666.35 --> 670.52
out from the soldier you know from from

668.12 --> 672.59
the smart people sometimes they don't

670.52 --> 675.86
think we are genuine because we don't

672.59 --> 680.99
accept the explanation given if not

675.86 --> 683.96
being genuine is that there are always

680.99 --> 687.14
broken links and missing links in the

683.96 --> 688.5500000000001
explanation it is something that I know

687.14 --> 690.88
I'm not getting satisfied by the

688.55 --> 693.4399999999999
explanations it's red herrings and

690.88 --> 697.1899999999999
presuppositions that's what it's always

693.44 --> 699.5
been and in my opinion this is so

697.19 --> 702.9200000000001
obvious that we should just emphasize

699.5 --> 705.05
this to no end and I find some of well

702.92 --> 708.9699999999999
the the tactics you could call it

705.05 --> 714.65
applied at Nathan's unnecessary like

708.97 --> 718.61
superfluous too much and if you're gonna

714.65 --> 721.16
use dubious arguments or controversial

718.61 --> 724.7
arguments that are not too

721.16 --> 729.0799999999999
then the ballers will latch onto that to

724.7 --> 731.3000000000001
in their minds keep us in the wrong like

729.08 --> 734.0600000000001
oh yeah see we are using the vyas

731.3 --> 738.1099999999999
tactics or whatever to get our way it's

734.06 --> 740.1199999999999
not necessary but hey it's it's a bit of

738.11 --> 745.24
a discovery choice I guess for Nathan as

740.12 --> 749.48
well and yesterday has to adapt he and

745.24 --> 752.92
everyone else and they will and I don't

749.48 --> 755.4200000000001
know we're gonna win anyway you know

752.92 --> 759.769
they're still all all their arguments

755.42 --> 761.5699999999999
are all red herring and presupposition

759.769 --> 763.73
based all of them without a single

761.57 --> 766.4590000000001
exception so it's a lot of faith and

763.73 --> 768.9200000000001
believe in bold but also the system in

766.459 --> 780.3699999999999
chocolate yes by the way hello chocolate

768.92 --> 780.37
sorry good morning anything - sure just

781.779 --> 788.329
talk about the debates a bit actually

785.81 --> 791.8699999999999
this devious show is this is the

788.329 --> 794.329
evolution that the true evolution let's

791.87 --> 797.54
say Nate and as a host since the flood

794.329 --> 799.4899999999999
divided one he have evolved to this this

797.54 --> 802.399
machine debater machine that he don't

799.49 --> 804.6800000000001
let any fallacies on any anything slide

802.399 --> 806.959
you know and everybody has pretty much

804.68 --> 810.1899999999999
evolved does the evolution I think this

806.959 --> 812.3199999999999
the psychological and the you know the

810.19 --> 814.4300000000001
the

812.32 --> 817.22
I'm trying to look for the world you

814.43 --> 820.52
know this Mars you know being smarter on

817.22 --> 823.61
on the details you know just just cash

820.52 --> 827.39
and and try to receive all the details

823.61 --> 829.16
possible and it's been the point that we

827.39 --> 832.01
just catch if a sentence is been

829.16 --> 834.02
structured and one letter is missing in

832.01 --> 836.0889999999999
the sentence we're gonna catch it like a

834.02 --> 837.62
you know what you say y'all are you

836.089 --> 839.6600000000001
supposed to say you all you know

837.62 --> 841.519
something like that we're gonna catch

839.66 --> 845.149
the details right there yeah but those

841.519 --> 847.73
are mostly like semantics and if you go

845.149 --> 852.529
for an official debate type format and

847.73 --> 854.6
yeah that is relevant although yeah it's

852.529 --> 857.12
so yeah yeah

854.6 --> 859.61
for example that's my example I mean it

857.12 --> 862.009
debates are like at a higher standard in

859.61 --> 865.22
a way so but that yeah everyone knows

862.009 --> 869.6800000000001
that's like much harsher much stricter

865.22 --> 872.089
and if you start to show

869.68 --> 875.12
presuppositional beliefs or red herrings

872.089 --> 878.5400000000001
then yeah you will get grilled you home

875.12 --> 881.12
your toes will be held to the fire yep

878.54 --> 883.579
until evolved is there anything I think

881.12 --> 887.089
that's a natural progression of the show

883.579 --> 889.13
it's needed to go because absolutely I

887.089 --> 892.73
agree the debates definition a very

889.13 --> 894.949
important word here all inside earlier

892.73 --> 897.11
debates were just full of ballers

894.949 --> 901.069
throwing all sexist crap all over the

897.11 --> 903.5600000000001
place and it would be just one two flat

901.069 --> 906.889
earthers and you know it that would be

903.56 --> 909.199
hard because the flatterer would be like

906.889 --> 911.8100000000001
whether it be Riley or whoever it was

909.199 --> 914.209
back then you know they made struggle

911.81 --> 917.149
with the argument because there's so

914.209 --> 918.8499999999999
many people throwing so many points that

917.149 --> 922.73
it's like how the hell can you even

918.85 --> 926.3000000000001
maintain that but I can an and gotten to

922.73 --> 926.899
a point where we can like wait it's like

926.3 --> 928.8499999999999
anything else

926.899 --> 932.24
surprise practice makes perfect we

928.85 --> 934.91
debate every day well obviously we're

932.24 --> 937.279
going to get better at it well I I see a

934.91 --> 939.259
distinct pattern in how it went and that

937.279 --> 943.31
is basically the globert had a vast

939.259 --> 945.38
library of systems and their usual

943.31 --> 948.8889999999999
tactic which works against the general

945.38 --> 950.93
public is just overwhelmed everyone with

948.889 --> 953.389
the amount of information but what we

950.93 --> 956.4799999999999
then did at first we were like oh [ __ ]

953.389 --> 959.6
is so much what are we gonna do but then

956.48 --> 963.139
we started to dig into the subjects one

959.6 --> 965.4200000000001
at a time and really explore it look

963.139 --> 967.67
into the source it and really structure

965.42 --> 970.939
eyes really learn it and then we figure

967.67 --> 973.25
out like hey wait every single one of

970.939 --> 976.3389999999999
these arguments that first overwhelmed

973.25 --> 978.11
us all has their roots and there's all

976.339 --> 980.72
kinds of issues with it and that's how

978.11 --> 985.639
we eventually came to our housekeeping

980.72 --> 988.08
questions and we Mawson it and that's

985.639 --> 990.99
why because that's why this guy and so

988.08 --> 993.1500000000001
much better because not only has the

990.99 --> 995.4300000000001
information gotten that are like the

993.15 --> 997.41
research we've done the things we've

995.43 --> 1000.1999999999999
figured out just by talking to each

997.41 --> 1003.77
other right but then there's also our

1000.2 --> 1007.7900000000001
tactics of the debate like now I feel

1003.77 --> 1010.73
like I can go out and and I can do like

1007.79 --> 1015.17
when I get into a flat earth argument

1010.73 --> 1017.62
with somebody I feel more confident

1015.17 --> 1020.24
about what I'm saying because I've

1017.62 --> 1021.8
practiced it I listen to it indeed you

1020.24 --> 1028.3700000000001
know I'm busy listening to these debates

1021.8 --> 1032.36
and sorry to interrupt but all of us fix

1028.37 --> 1034.58
panel members like two years ago we if

1032.36 --> 1037.04
we would have been confronted with like

1034.58 --> 1042.4399999999998
a real studied astronomer or a

1037.04 --> 1044.75
mathematician or a physicist then we

1042.44 --> 1046.79
would be super nervous and like oh my

1044.75 --> 1050.09
god this person knows so much details

1046.79 --> 1052.85
they're so sharp in the field now we

1050.09 --> 1055.1299999999999
figured pretty much out like what are

1052.85 --> 1056.78
these types how do they think of what

1055.13 --> 1059.69
what is the material they really have

1056.78 --> 1062.44
learned so now if we would bump into one

1059.69 --> 1065.51
of these persons we wouldn't shy away

1062.44 --> 1068.03
because we would be we would feel

1065.51 --> 1071.99
prepared we would have you're absolutely

1068.03 --> 1075.1399999999999
right Mace's approach these I seek out

1071.99 --> 1079.73
the the smarter ones I seek out the ones

1075.14 --> 1082.5400000000002
like the scientists quote the engineers

1079.73 --> 1086.81
the ones that have a little bit more

1082.54 --> 1089.03
authority then yeah the regular person

1086.81 --> 1090.56
on the street cuz Escalade

1089.03 --> 1092.45
the regular person on the street they

1090.56 --> 1094.49
they won't be able to even deal with

1092.45 --> 1096.5
whatever arguments I bring notes

1094.49 --> 1100.7
they'll go straight to both disappeared

1096.5 --> 1102.74
as a curve and we see curve from a plane

1100.7 --> 1105.02
and I mean that that's gonna be the

1102.74 --> 1107.69
level of argument the ruler Joe is going

1105.02 --> 1111.74
to come with you know gravity gravity

1107.69 --> 1113.63
everything's gravity just curve at first

1111.74 --> 1115.3
you know most people don't even concern

1113.63 --> 1119.8400000000001
themselves with gravity

1115.3 --> 1120.71
no but start to debunk because I've

1119.84 --> 1123.74
experienced

1120.71 --> 1126.26
yeah but that's right ball in space but

1123.74 --> 1128.779
people don't usually even start out with

1126.26 --> 1131.059
that usually what most people know it's

1128.779 --> 1134.179
like ships going over the horizon in a

1131.059 --> 1136.94
plane it might look curved satellite

1134.179 --> 1138.8300000000002
pictures that's what everyone pretty

1136.94 --> 1141.919
much knows we trust in confirmed of what

1138.83 --> 1144.6789999999999
the back-and-forth that I've had it's

1141.919 --> 1148.0700000000002
it's it usually starts with the

1144.679 --> 1150.169
curvature and then once there do they

1148.07 --> 1152.6589999999999
see that curvature argument isn't

1150.169 --> 1154.76
working and then you get to something

1152.659 --> 1156.8600000000001
let's say like the gas pressure next to

1154.76 --> 1158.99
a vacuum you know it comes right to

1156.86 --> 1162.77
gravity because that's the only other

1158.99 --> 1165.529
thing that you know the average Joe

1162.77 --> 1166.7
knows about this type of system if

1165.529 --> 1170.149
they're not into it

1166.7 --> 1173.659
it's so silly because I I don't I really

1170.149 --> 1177.649
don't get why the ballers say that

1173.659 --> 1181.25
gravity could contain the gas pressure

1177.649 --> 1184.6399999999999
versus a vacuum because by official

1181.25 --> 1187.58
standards this is when it's reason our

1184.64 --> 1190.01
grains not love it doesn't work if you

1187.58 --> 1192.8899999999999
assume gravity is a force

1190.01 --> 1195.11
the way it should be the way it measures

1192.89 --> 1198.26
out it can't work so even in their

1195.11 --> 1200.0
theory it can't work honestly and it's

1198.26 --> 1203.0
just so silly that they keep

1200.0 --> 1206.899
perpetuating this myth is fairy tale

1203.0 --> 1209.6
about this basic visualization about how

1206.899 --> 1211.9399999999998
it's supposed to be working when the

1209.6 --> 1215.149
force of gravity yeah it would pull

1211.94 --> 1219.529
somewhat on the gas but yeah

1215.149 --> 1224.75
the entropy force that causes gas to

1219.529 --> 1227.47
rapidly expand into a vacuum to fill the

1224.75 --> 1230.899
container whatever it may be is

1227.47 --> 1233.059
astronomically stronger astronomically

1230.899 --> 1235.1589999999999
stronger than gravity gravity is

1233.059 --> 1239.779
relatively weak force it's admitted and

1235.159 --> 1243.529
entropy the gas expansion power the the

1239.779 --> 1246.23
inherent force of of material basically

1243.529 --> 1250.909
of gaseous material to expand into a

1246.23 --> 1253.09
vacuum is so strong it's a very strong

1250.909 --> 1255.46
natural phenomena you could call it

1253.09 --> 1258.28
and I think can't work it can't work in

1255.46 --> 1263.32
their model and they still they keep on

1258.28 --> 1265.93
saying like it is it's sad you know it

1263.32 --> 1267.6399999999999
depends also on the type of person

1265.93 --> 1269.77
you're talking to because I did bring

1267.64 --> 1272.8600000000001
that up to somebody the other day I

1269.77 --> 1274.84
asked him simply because I say he said

1272.86 --> 1278.56
something about space and I flippantly

1274.84 --> 1280.99
said you know space is fake and he

1278.56 --> 1281.5
wanted to stop me and say wait a minute

1280.99 --> 1287.35
wait a minute

1281.5 --> 1289.99
what do you mean space is fake whoa it's

1287.35 --> 1292.4199999999998
not what they were telling you with this

1289.99 --> 1293.86
I'll tell you that he was like what what

1292.42 --> 1296.4
do you mean by that well I was like well

1293.86 --> 1299.85
you explain to me how you could have

1296.4 --> 1305.3500000000001
vacuum next to a pressurized system I

1299.85 --> 1311.35
can do that I think the biggest the

1305.35 --> 1317.02
biggest benefit that yeah you're

1311.35 --> 1319.27
breaking up a little bit chocolate the

1317.02 --> 1323.56
biggest benefit that I have get out of

1319.27 --> 1326.62
this latter debates is actually in the

1323.56 --> 1329.26
personal personal side of things by that

1326.62 --> 1332.4699999999998
I mean but job wise we learn how I

1329.26 --> 1334.57
learned how to dissect the contracts you

1332.47 --> 1336.3700000000001
know the rules the regulations of the

1334.57 --> 1340.78
jobs you know the duties and all that

1336.37 --> 1343.8999999999999
stuff and then when I'm spoken to by by

1340.78 --> 1346.3
manager boss or whatever I know you know

1343.9 --> 1350.16
the lines if they cross the lines if

1346.3 --> 1352.54
they try to do to save fallacies and

1350.16 --> 1355.68
exaggerations and [ __ ] like that that

1352.54 --> 1359.32
are not in the rules and regulations I

1355.68 --> 1361.99
argue that [ __ ] up to the dead and

1359.32 --> 1363.6699999999998
with the right you know like no this is

1361.99 --> 1364.8700000000001
the way it should be and this is the way

1363.67 --> 1366.73
you're gonna do I don't care if you've

1364.87 --> 1369.28
been 20 years in the job and I just be

1366.73 --> 1372.25
in one week this is the way it should be

1369.28 --> 1374.35
because that's it I mean is the rules is

1372.25 --> 1376.39
the law is the contractor is that oh no

1374.35 --> 1379.59
but everybody has to do this I said like

1376.39 --> 1382.45
yeah but not me because I'm not you know

1379.59 --> 1385.03
it's not mandatory is you know whatever

1382.45 --> 1386.95
you know and everywhere you know in

1385.03 --> 1388.69
interactions in the street

1386.95 --> 1390.43
you know you can uh kind of hear people

1388.69 --> 1392.23
and I cache what they're talking about

1390.43 --> 1394.15
if it's philosophy if it's something

1392.23 --> 1395.92
really fees [ __ ] they're talking

1394.15 --> 1396.72
about little stories and see I don't

1395.92 --> 1399.5800000000002
know I just

1396.72 --> 1401.74
discerned better what the people is made

1399.58 --> 1402.1599999999999
out of after talking to them for a few

1401.74 --> 1406.0
minutes

1402.16 --> 1409.24
only you know yep hey you when you let

1406.0 --> 1411.85
somebody share what they know about it

1409.24 --> 1413.98
you really get to size up what their

1411.85 --> 1416.1999999999998
level of knowledge is cuz you've seen

1413.98 --> 1418.54
everybody go through the step so many

1416.2 --> 1420.8500000000001
time you're just gonna feel for it you

1418.54 --> 1423.69
you could hear somebody talk and you

1420.85 --> 1426.25
could say then okay they have like a

1423.69 --> 1429.16
level three knowledge on this and a

1426.25 --> 1431.79
level one knowledge on this and you can

1429.16 --> 1435.01
just see okay they're here on the scale

1431.79 --> 1436.81
it's lovely because you've seen it so

1435.01 --> 1440.56
many times she could just size it up all

1436.81 --> 1443.23
of a sudden almost like a businessman

1440.56 --> 1446.4099999999999
can size up an investment because

1443.23 --> 1450.31
they've dealt with it so many times you

1446.41 --> 1453.5800000000002
get the feel for it you can see it's

1450.31 --> 1457.27
interesting we have we have become

1453.58 --> 1463.33
experts on learning about this basically

1457.27 --> 1469.26
that you're three are women behind me no

1463.33 --> 1469.26
I eat like pecan like walnuts and pecans

1471.12 --> 1479.05
it's not a walnut tree that does look

1474.04 --> 1481.8999999999999
different yeah beacon beacon it cool if

1479.05 --> 1484.3
it's hazy and cloudy my planning me my

1481.9 --> 1485.68
wife and my in-laws my in-laws came to

1484.3 --> 1486.94
visit from Puerto Rico they're gonna be

1485.68 --> 1489.55
here about a week and a half

1486.94 --> 1491.71
my sister-in-law and we're gonna go hang

1489.55 --> 1493.8899999999999
out we're gonna take a ferry over here

1491.71 --> 1496.21
I'm gonna take my p900 in the ferry

1493.89 --> 1498.1000000000001
record around you know document a little

1496.21 --> 1500.8600000000001
bit take pictures of the family and go

1498.1 --> 1502.27
to the other side and the shore and zoom

1500.86 --> 1503.8899999999999
over here to see what I'm gonna catch

1502.27 --> 1507.07
him my side you know it's gonna be cool

1503.89 --> 1511.8100000000002
is really cloudy I don't have long

1507.07 --> 1514.47
visibility maybe 10 miles maybe 15 tops

1511.81 --> 1517.1799999999998
but it's gonna be cool still you know to

1514.47 --> 1519.1000000000001
take my my [ __ ] home to the photo ride

1517.18 --> 1520.3600000000001
and take a little bit of food is you

1519.1 --> 1522.03
know write a

1520.36 --> 1523.8999999999999
if you wanna be a little bit

1522.03 --> 1529.049
attention-grabber you should call it

1523.9 --> 1531.3700000000001
flat earth fairy photography nice yeah

1529.049 --> 1532.0
yeah because I will upload you no later

1531.37 --> 1534.25
than tonight

1532.0 --> 1535.65
although whatever little snippets of

1534.25 --> 1539.29
whatever I cut today

1535.65 --> 1540.94
cool can't wait to see it awesome yeah

1539.29 --> 1544.8999999999999
yeah I can't wait to share it with

1540.94 --> 1546.52
everybody when were they coming they are

1544.9 --> 1549.75
here they've been here for three days

1546.52 --> 1551.77
yeah so are we are we are gonna leave is

1549.75 --> 1553.66
7:42 in the morning we're gonna leave at

1551.77 --> 1556.24
10 in the morning so I'm gonna be maybe

1553.66 --> 1558.28
halfway in the second show so I'm gonna

1556.24 --> 1560.169
probably hang up and just hang out with

1558.28 --> 1562.57
the family go over there yeah like a

1560.169 --> 1565.45
half an hour drive to the ferry we're

1562.57 --> 1567.82
gonna put hop the car inside the big

1565.45 --> 1570.07
boat you know and then I think it's like

1567.82 --> 1572.4099999999999
an hour later ride in the on the big

1570.07 --> 1573.79
ferry and then we're gonna just hang out

1572.41 --> 1577.48
in the other side for a few hours and

1573.79 --> 1579.1599999999999
come back cool well can't wait to see

1577.48 --> 1581.6200000000001
you some of those photographs tomorrow

1579.16 --> 1583.27
or yeah yeah video you're probably gonna

1581.62 --> 1585.58
make a video but yeah I'll probably

1583.27 --> 1588.4
upload one one or two short ones today

1585.58 --> 1590.9189999999999
and then then review and really good and

1588.4 --> 1600.0400000000002
make a better ones for the next couple

1590.919 --> 1601.75
days cool nice so halfway or well we're

1600.04 --> 1606.48
half hour into the show the show's

1601.75 --> 1609.4
totally going to be 45 minutes max

1606.48 --> 1611.919
Nathan's already put out his link and

1609.4 --> 1614.799
the link to his show to the first debate

1611.919 --> 1617.5300000000002
show is already in the description so

1614.799 --> 1624.4
make sure to check go there after the

1617.53 --> 1627.37
show everyone in chat please remind

1624.4 --> 1629.38
yourself to subscribe and you might have

1627.37 --> 1632.86
been subscribed to the check if you

1629.38 --> 1635.65
still are because yeah people still do

1632.86 --> 1638.53
get unsubscribe from my channel for no

1635.65 --> 1641.1100000000001
good reason and I regularly see people

1638.53 --> 1643.87
that I know were subscribed to me just

1641.11 --> 1648.1
subscribe to me again so this seems to

1643.87 --> 1650.1999999999998
be happening despite all that still my

1648.1 --> 1653.9399999999998
subscriber base has been growing

1650.2 --> 1657.0900000000001
steadily very happy about that so yeah

1653.94 --> 1660.96
this is keeps on going I might actually

1657.09 --> 1662.6999999999998
get to those thousand subscribers well

1660.96 --> 1665.6100000000001
who knows how long it will take maybe

1662.7 --> 1667.3500000000001
the end of the year maybe halfway next

1665.61 --> 1669.87
year I don't know all depends on the

1667.35 --> 1672.03
interest and on the guests we're gonna

1669.87 --> 1673.2299999999998
be having here because yeah the guests

1672.03 --> 1677.19
do make the show if you're just gonna

1673.23 --> 1681.6
see me talking on my own but yeah that's

1677.19 --> 1684.06
gonna on a daily basis it's gonna get a

1681.6 --> 1688.5
little boring I think I would be bored

1684.06 --> 1694.73
personally thanks Michael O'Rourke for

1688.5 --> 1697.05
subscribing so yeah what else what

1694.73 --> 1703.65
anything that you guys want to talk

1697.05 --> 1707.09
about anything else maybe some

1703.65 --> 1707.0900000000001
suggestions in chat

1713.08 --> 1720.12
a five artists liber Alice good to see

1716.17 --> 1720.1200000000001
you hey if I participial

1720.9 --> 1725.91
just hit me up up on skype and I will

1724.54 --> 1728.53
send you the hang-up link

1725.91 --> 1731.89
although the show is gonna last a

1728.53 --> 1735.79
maximum of 15 minutes but otherwise yeah

1731.89 --> 1738.8200000000002
you can always come tomorrow and join

1735.79 --> 1740.86
them if you have the time I missed the

1738.82 --> 1743.62
first this is the third edition right

1740.86 --> 1746.02
before one supportive awesome I missed

1743.62 --> 1748.36
the first three completely because I

1746.02 --> 1750.79
work till late you know I usually get

1748.36 --> 1752.59
off work maybe a few minutes before the

1750.79 --> 1754.8999999999999
night ends oh or halfway into Nathan's

1752.59 --> 1757.6899999999998
show so alright how did it go in the

1754.9 --> 1761.5600000000002
first few you got a bunch of views great

1757.69 --> 1766.63
it was fantastic yeah went much it was

1761.56 --> 1768.6699999999998
pretty spontaneous for me to do this I

1766.63 --> 1772.2700000000002
would think it out like yeah I wanted to

1768.67 --> 1774.6000000000001
do a a daily show but I can't do the

1772.27 --> 1777.75
flatter talks thing because the way I

1774.6 --> 1781.3899999999999
designed that was to have unique

1777.75 --> 1784.18
separate subjects so that the separate

1781.39 --> 1786.76
hangouts would keep on standing out over

1784.18 --> 1790.78
time and stay relevant like a kind of

1786.76 --> 1792.79
like a painting a a a time-based

1790.78 --> 1794.62
painting that's how I treated those and

1792.79 --> 1796.06
yeah I ran out of subjects and now that

1794.62 --> 1796.54
gravity has pretty much been laid to

1796.06 --> 1801.3999999999999
rest

1796.54 --> 1805.12
I might make like an aftermath hangout

1801.4 --> 1807.16
about gravity is an aberration still

1805.12 --> 1812.32
considering that I I probably will do

1807.16 --> 1813.39
that somewhere one of the last ones for

1812.32 --> 1815.98
for a while

1813.39 --> 1818.8300000000002
any special subject anything that comes

1815.98 --> 1822.4
to mind you feel I got better you know

1818.83 --> 1829.6599999999999
oh no I'm still really interested in is

1822.4 --> 1831.67
what causes lava what actually makes it

1829.66 --> 1835.3600000000001
where does the laughs I come into being

1831.67 --> 1840.45
we know it could be sustained for

1835.36 --> 1840.4499999999998
example they're like compartments or

1840.63 --> 1845.2600000000002
yeah places where there is lava and it

1843.97 --> 1846.429
stays that way

1845.26 --> 1849.009
so why

1846.429 --> 1852.6390000000001
keeps it that hot we know how heat is

1849.009 --> 1854.679
transferred from well from one material

1852.639 --> 1857.889
to another so yeah there's something

1854.679 --> 1861.159
heating it what is keeping it heated to

1857.889 --> 1863.4989999999998
the level that it is liquid that it is

1861.159 --> 1866.71
actually magma what keeps it that way I

1863.499 --> 1870.22
want to know it I have absolutely no

1866.71 --> 1872.8600000000001
idea yeah close

1870.22 --> 1874.57
there is one theory I laid out and just

1872.86 --> 1876.1589999999999
on the level as the gravity thing like

1874.57 --> 1881.139
oh yeah what could cause gravity it

1876.159 --> 1883.2990000000002
could be in a Mobius disk what's called

1881.139 --> 1886.869
then this could be centrifugal force

1883.299 --> 1891.19
like very nice solution to it well with

1886.869 --> 1893.98
lava yeah I could theorize okay it's

1891.19 --> 1896.259
coil induction it's like natural or

1893.98 --> 1898.96
artificially created coil induction in

1896.259 --> 1900.97
the ground melting the lava it's strong

1898.96 --> 1902.559
enough electricity to do that but it

1900.97 --> 1905.83
would leave remnants it would be

1902.559 --> 1908.83
measurable it is the only way I could

1905.83 --> 1911.74
think of for lava to be created and

1908.83 --> 1914.59
sustained in such a way but first

1911.74 --> 1917.98
research all the signs of something

1914.59 --> 1919.749
being there like that yeah we try and

1917.98 --> 1922.48
there's currents of lava that's it

1919.749 --> 1925.299
that's on Google on Google and

1922.48 --> 1927.34
everywhere else on the internet find

1925.299 --> 1929.649
every information that is available on

1927.34 --> 1932.559
the narrative that we all know what the

1929.649 --> 1935.1999999999998
heliocentric model so download it all

1932.559 --> 1936.639
learn at all dissected watched all day

1935.2 --> 1939.1290000000001
all these documentaries that you can

1936.639 --> 1940.899
find all these videos and then put it

1939.129 --> 1945.82
all together and then you know it's

1940.899 --> 1948.879
gonna bloom so yeah I've already seen

1945.82 --> 1952.72
pretty much any story about lava and

1948.879 --> 1957.009
it's always the same throw back at the

1952.72 --> 1959.59
just so story nobody is actually like

1957.009 --> 1962.74
getting technical or chemical like how

1959.59 --> 1966.73
does laughs I come into existence what

1962.74 --> 1970.119
are the things what needs there to be to

1966.73 --> 1971.74
keep it in the liquid state nobody asks

1970.119 --> 1973.48
these questions in the mainstream is

1971.74 --> 1974.919
always like oh that could look at here

1973.48 --> 1978.6390000000001
is lava oh this is where it's supposed

1974.919 --> 1980.14
to be coming from that's it that's the

1978.639 --> 1983.1899999999998
only information that's

1980.14 --> 1986.95
out there nobody's doing any actual

1983.19 --> 1990.25
experiments yeah you got it started

1986.95 --> 1993.67
you gotta create it it can't get down

1990.25 --> 1996.97
there man yeah but nobody even tries to

1993.67 --> 2000.39
artificially create lava that I know of

1996.97 --> 2003.9
for example so who wants towards to

2000.39 --> 2006.8600000000001
create something that hot because you

2003.9 --> 2012.0
can because you want to know what it is

2006.86 --> 2014.4599999999998
you know I can already I can already see

2012.0 --> 2015.63
your document your special happening you

2014.46 --> 2019.41
go in the camera

2015.63 --> 2023.5500000000002
what is lava okay billion some billions

2019.41 --> 2025.71
of years ago when they forgive you do a

2023.55 --> 2027.3899999999999
little little two minutes explanation

2025.71 --> 2029.4
the heliocentric model you know maybe

2027.39 --> 2031.5600000000002
put a little graphic and a colorful

2029.4 --> 2034.5
thing and then you're like but that's

2031.56 --> 2039.51
all [ __ ] you know and then you start

2034.5 --> 2041.81
with your funny idea yeah I'll keep that

2039.51 --> 2046.05
in the back of my mind Thank You Jose

2041.81 --> 2047.85
it's cool but yeah though those are two

2046.05 --> 2050.52
subjects I could still do for the

2047.85 --> 2053.13
flatter socks but yeah I'll leave that

2050.52 --> 2056.85
to the Flat Earth talks okay because the

2053.13 --> 2061.77
more I think of that molten iron core it

2056.85 --> 2065.25
just becomes sillier every day they do

2061.77 --> 2067.71
seem to kind of one evade that maybe

2065.25 --> 2072.12
it's not iron core maybe it's a sodium

2067.71 --> 2074.85
car it's like that's that they know

2072.12 --> 2078.2999999999997
there's any core like the whole core

2074.85 --> 2083.1
thing would come from a bunch of rocks

2078.3 --> 2086.34
just coalescing into the engine because

2083.1 --> 2088.47
of gravity into the tight ball and then

2086.34 --> 2090.929
of course a for surprise but are all

2088.47 --> 2094.5899999999997
this crap that turns around it and then

2090.929 --> 2100.4900000000002
I don't know like the whole story of of

2094.59 --> 2105.0
how the earth came to be it's ridiculous

2100.49 --> 2109.95
but I think personally that they might

2105.0 --> 2111.78
actually try to how do you say I think

2109.95 --> 2114.02
they're really gonna try to kind of

2111.78 --> 2117.349
switch it and say that although

2114.02 --> 2120.56
we always thought it was actually iron

2117.349 --> 2122.9
down there but we have discovered

2120.56 --> 2126.29
something new we scan something new and

2122.9 --> 2129.08
it was actually a sodium card they may

2126.29 --> 2132.589
actually pull something like that and it

2129.08 --> 2134.23
would be a more constructive solution to

2132.589 --> 2137.39
their problem isn't it

2134.23 --> 2139.79
because then yeah they wouldn't have to

2137.39 --> 2141.8799999999997
be confronted with the question of like

2139.79 --> 2144.099
yeah how is molten iron gonna be

2141.88 --> 2147.589
magnetic you know that kind of nonsense

2144.099 --> 2149.69
it's not nonsense it's just interference

2147.589 --> 2151.82
for them but if they just say okay it

2149.69 --> 2156.619
actually turned out to be a sodium core

2151.82 --> 2158.6600000000003
so then one will play at what point is

2156.619 --> 2162.05
like okay so it's supposed to be

2158.66 --> 2166.8799999999997
magnetic right so now when does that

2162.05 --> 2168.8590000000004
turn into gravity you know what I mean

2166.88 --> 2170.9
no it doesn't right now but that's

2168.859 --> 2173.5099999999998
nothing to do with that gravity is

2170.9 --> 2177.19
always going to be caused by matter

2173.51 --> 2180.7700000000004
itself in accordance to people's minds

2177.19 --> 2184.099
okay but all right so what there's

2180.77 --> 2187.07
gravity that supposedly pulls everything

2184.099 --> 2192.76
to the center of the earth if we're not

2187.07 --> 2196.04
talking about Newtonian yeah but that's

2192.76 --> 2198.2000000000003
really no look the Einsteinian concept

2196.04 --> 2201.2
it is so ethereal that most people might

2198.2 --> 2204.29
have heard about it yeah they'll just

2201.2 --> 2206.8999999999996
say like yeah that probably gotten all

2204.29 --> 2208.79
the fine for everybody who follows

2206.9 --> 2211.339
science fiction sort of bending of

2208.79 --> 2213.44
space-time at some point but look the

2211.339 --> 2219.619
only thing that Einstein basically did

2213.44 --> 2224.119
is really give in well in a theory the

2219.619 --> 2226.94
cause - well Newton's workings it's just

2224.119 --> 2230.69
another approach but it doesn't actually

2226.94 --> 2233.23
look like a nice just tells it how it

2230.69 --> 2236.599
works how it how the gravity

2233.23 --> 2240.29
interactions work of magic because of

2236.599 --> 2243.349
the molten iron core then multi-item

2240.29 --> 2245.69
core pulls everything so in my client or

2243.349 --> 2246.5
even though it literally to attract

2245.69 --> 2250.79
matter

2246.5 --> 2252.71
no miss magnet even notice is magnetic

2250.79 --> 2256.46
force when is molting in the Curie

2252.71 --> 2259.01
temperature but there's they this the

2256.46 --> 2261.71
rotation of the earth is the outside

2259.01 --> 2264.4700000000003
force that keep you know making it

2261.71 --> 2277.18
softer patty wait so the gravity works I

2264.47 --> 2277.18
don't know some kind of [ __ ] sorry I

2277.36 --> 2281.9900000000002
got it explain like a little kid no no

2280.34 --> 2284.27
no but you don't understand this is the

2281.99 --> 2285.95
way in the discord over there and I

2284.27 --> 2287.78
gotta I'm listening I'm they explain

2285.95 --> 2289.1899999999996
everything to me they say you got it you

2287.78 --> 2291.0800000000004
gotta learn their ride and you gotta

2289.19 --> 2292.64
defend your stuff and you gotta bring

2291.08 --> 2294.7999999999997
this to Nate and when they talk about is

2292.64 --> 2297.2599999999998
a dude I just forgot I mean I've I

2294.8 --> 2298.9100000000003
remembered like a handful of words of

2297.26 --> 2301.67
you told me what I cannot articulate

2298.91 --> 2303.08
this you know in a good sense to the

2301.67 --> 2304.73
fame that even though I if I don't

2303.08 --> 2307.31
believe it I would like to propose these

2304.73 --> 2310.46
in in behalf of the ballers because I

2307.31 --> 2313.04
like the argument but I cannot propose

2310.46 --> 2314.51
the point and try to defend it I mean

2313.04 --> 2317.0
I'm not going to learn them because it's

2314.51 --> 2320.69
just [ __ ] and it's just I don't know

2317.0 --> 2324.74
to come believe it if it's broken man no

2320.69 --> 2327.14
but it all depends on your psychological

2324.74 --> 2331.1899999999996
angle of approach becomes involved I

2327.14 --> 2333.8599999999997
could defend any of it any of it and I

2331.19 --> 2338.9
would improve upon it but only because

2333.86 --> 2343.61
it is a virtual to be it is a system we

2338.9 --> 2347.51
built science fiction system built on

2343.61 --> 2350.3900000000003
theoretical principles and I know how

2347.51 --> 2352.01
that works so I absolutely defended but

2350.39 --> 2354.95
yeah if people would ask so where's your

2352.01 --> 2357.59
proof or yeah and I thought it's like

2354.95 --> 2360.7999999999997
yeah it's all presuppositional it anyway

2357.59 --> 2362.7200000000003
so it's it's a game it's like a game

2360.8 --> 2364.34
it's like we are competing against

2362.72 --> 2371.06
Nathan right now he's live already oh

2364.34 --> 2373.6000000000004
he's already live yeah damn it come on

2371.06 --> 2373.6
Nathan

2375.47 --> 2382.43
I will cut this show then for now and

2380.54 --> 2385.069
hey thank you two guys for coming and

2382.43 --> 2387.02
William to freak music not a problem

2385.069 --> 2387.47
here or with knife to how I said will

2387.02 --> 2390.68
you go

2387.47 --> 2393.47
indeed yeah please do come again if you

2390.68 --> 2397.25
can tomorrow and if you mute now round

2393.47 --> 2398.9599999999996
out the show thank you everyone in chat

2397.25 --> 2401.72
for coming

2398.96 --> 2404.96
this was early bird a flat earth early

2401.72 --> 2408.589
bird number four said yeah it was little

2404.96 --> 2411.5
shorter than usual because I wasn't that

2408.589 --> 2414.0499999999997
early this as an early bird today but

2411.5 --> 2416.63
yeah we still had a great talk with Jose

2414.05 --> 2419.7200000000003
and chocolatine about Flat Earth debates

2416.63 --> 2422.329
and about psychology of the globe and a

2419.72 --> 2425.4199999999996
lot of things still so it was a good
