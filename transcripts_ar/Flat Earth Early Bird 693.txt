100.72 --> 108.15899999999999
it's been very cold all night like

103.84 --> 111.119
really cold and yeah

108.159 --> 112.0
you just notice it that a lot of trees

111.119 --> 116.24
are really

112.0 --> 116.24
getting into autumn colors

116.64 --> 120.07900000000001
but right now it's kind of nice it's

118.799 --> 122.96000000000001
sort of wind still

120.079 --> 129.039
and there's some some in between yeah

122.96 --> 131.95
the fluffy looking clouds

129.039 --> 134.55999999999997
yeah and i got up pretty early today

131.95 --> 138.0
[Music]

134.56 --> 141.599
like 11 o'clock

138.0 --> 142.48
uh didn't go to bed too late last night

141.599 --> 146.959
so yeah

142.48 --> 146.959
i don't know it's an interesting morning

147.2 --> 155.44
i feel very calm compared to yesterday

152.4 --> 157.68
also skipped dinner yesterday

155.44 --> 158.959
because i did i don't know man maybe i

157.68 --> 161.28
think it might have been

158.959 --> 162.8
like the soy after all but it just felt

161.28 --> 164.879
bloaty

162.8 --> 167.20000000000002
the whole day it was weird and i just

164.879 --> 169.44
skipped my dinner

167.2 --> 171.51899999999998
thought okay i'm gonna do do like

169.44 --> 173.599
miniature fasting even though i was kind

171.519 --> 177.20000000000002
of hungry

173.599 --> 177.2
and that does feel better today

177.44 --> 185.84
so yeah

187.2 --> 190.48
yeah i'm not sure i just i'm not willing

189.68 --> 193.68
to now

190.48 --> 195.84
go eat more so i just feel like

193.68 --> 197.12
whatever it is that it did it didn't

195.84 --> 200.239
feel all that great

197.12 --> 205.20000000000002
it was sufficient to feed

200.239 --> 205.20000000000002
the body but it i don't know

209.44 --> 214.0
didn't get any allergic reactions or

211.92 --> 216.319
anything but still

214.0 --> 217.36
it's not something i'm gonna use as a

216.319 --> 222.39999999999998
staple food

217.36 --> 222.4
that's for sure right anyway

222.48 --> 227.84
uh yeah flat earth debates was pretty

224.959 --> 227.84
was pretty good

230.879 --> 234.72
so it's not very good for you regardless

232.799 --> 237.28
of what they say

234.72 --> 238.84
well you know maybe it could be

237.28 --> 241.76
considered as like an

238.84 --> 244.31900000000002
emergency ration type food or something

241.76 --> 244.319
i don't know

246.08 --> 249.84
i don't know what like organic soy does

248.72 --> 251.12
for example to

249.84 --> 254.879
[Music]

251.12 --> 257.919
or as animal feed i don't know

254.879 --> 261.03999999999996
i should ask organic farmers about that

257.919 --> 261.59999999999997
i don't know well maybe yeah some of

261.04 --> 263.6
these

261.6 --> 268.47900000000004
guests that big bear has on know more

263.6 --> 270.96000000000004
about that

268.479 --> 272.8
i'll make sure to ask that question

270.96 --> 273.59999999999997
sometime the next time he has some kind

272.8 --> 277.04
of farmer guy

273.6 --> 277.04
on huh

277.12 --> 283.84000000000003
right anyway there was also yeah no

280.639 --> 283.84000000000003
benjamin live yesterday

284.96 --> 290.479
and talking a lot about politics

288.4 --> 292.71999999999997
the political situation and from his

290.479 --> 297.84
perspective

292.72 --> 297.84000000000003
and it was very interesting

300.32 --> 305.68
like he he does basically with his ideas

303.52 --> 309.039
that are very grounded

305.68 --> 310.96
he's very consistent and

309.039 --> 313.52
i know he has a very good way to put it

310.96 --> 316.96
down it really makes me think

313.52 --> 316.96
and reconsider things

317.6 --> 327.199
way more carefully anyway

324.0 --> 329.919
right yeah something

327.199 --> 330.479
that i did i usually didn't do that was

329.919 --> 334.15999999999997
during d

330.479 --> 337.4
live after that after big bear somewhere

334.16 --> 339.12
and i just saw some one of the random

337.4 --> 342.15999999999997
recommendations

339.12 --> 343.919
for streams that dlive also does

342.16 --> 346.40000000000003
and there was this guy apparently

343.919 --> 350.0
streaming baldur's gate 3

346.4 --> 351.67999999999995
so i was like okay

350.0 --> 353.36
i didn't know that was there was

351.68 --> 355.039
something live about that so i checked

353.36 --> 357.36
it out

355.039 --> 359.68
was just a small time guy there were

357.36 --> 362.08000000000004
like seven people in chat and but he was

359.68 --> 364.24
very communicative and

362.08 --> 366.71999999999997
didn't bring a flat earth didn't think

364.24 --> 370.24
he was the type for that who knows

366.72 --> 372.639
he didn't inquire but yeah into the game

370.24 --> 374.72
into baldur's gate asked questions about

372.639 --> 376.96000000000004
the game so far took a look at some of

374.72 --> 381.91900000000004
the things he showed and

376.96 --> 385.35999999999996
hmm and it was apparently a trial run

381.919 --> 390.31899999999996
like a pre-game a lot of cutscenes

385.36 --> 390.319
and it reminded me a lot about uh

391.039 --> 395.84
recall again the other um

395.919 --> 401.039
i have that it's a dragon siege

399.6 --> 402.96000000000004
what's it called dragon siege or

401.039 --> 406.31899999999996
something

402.96 --> 409.919
well done because i yeah

406.319 --> 413.12
back in like 2006 or something 2007

409.919 --> 415.19899999999996
i bought that game and this the way the

413.12 --> 416.08
cut scenes were reminded me a lot about

415.199 --> 419.039
there were very

416.08 --> 422.479
extensive detailed cutscenes and then

419.039 --> 425.039
immediately as a designer basically

422.479 --> 427.36
already foreseeing problems with how

425.039 --> 430.96
different the game is going to be

427.36 --> 434.96000000000004
they modeled it after certain things

430.96 --> 436.31899999999996
but will that keep the baldur's gate

434.96 --> 438.479
essence

436.319 --> 439.52000000000004
alive in order to actually call it

438.479 --> 441.75899999999996
baldur's gate 3

439.52 --> 442.88
see because the first and the second

441.759 --> 445.28000000000003
game they have were

442.88 --> 448.15999999999997
i i'd like to talk about this typically

445.28 --> 452.0
because i'm such fans of these games

448.16 --> 454.8
and i listen a lot to the music and

452.0 --> 455.199
polish gate the baldur's gate one and

454.8 --> 459.28000000000003
two

455.199 --> 462.0
they're not really about the graphics

459.28 --> 465.44
they're not it's all about it's a sound

462.0 --> 469.039
game most of it

465.44 --> 472.24
and and text so

469.039 --> 474.15999999999997
and with these cutscenes they

472.24 --> 475.36
they show off like oh look at the

474.16 --> 477.759
amazing models

475.36 --> 479.599
like i was just staring at this freaking

477.759 --> 480.96000000000004
armor that a character was wearing just

479.599 --> 482.96
like what

480.96 --> 485.44
that's insane they had literally had

482.96 --> 487.44
like encrusted rubies in there

485.44 --> 488.879
and sometimes you could literally like

487.44 --> 491.84
see

488.879 --> 492.72
through them it was like i was astounded

491.84 --> 494.87899999999996
my mind was blown

492.72 --> 498.0
like what the [ __ ] that really looks

494.879 --> 501.12
like a real ruby this is insane

498.0 --> 504.4
and but it's so distracting so

501.12 --> 508.08
visual see

504.4 --> 509.28
so i wonder what it's going to turn out

508.08 --> 511.52
to be

509.28 --> 514.0799999999999
i'm kind of pessimistic i think it might

511.52 --> 515.039
be of just a very high quality game

514.08 --> 516.8000000000001
overall

515.039 --> 520.0
but i think that it's going to be just

516.8 --> 523.039
very different

520.0 --> 525.519
know but then again

523.039 --> 527.8389999999999
also the guy said he played his own

525.519 --> 530.08
music over it

527.839 --> 531.2
and i don't know who's gonna direct the

530.08 --> 533.36
music

531.2 --> 535.839
if it's gonna be the same couple of

533.36 --> 535.839
people

536.16 --> 543.1999999999999
right but anyway that's something i did

539.76 --> 544.72
gaming and it's funny like it just

543.2 --> 546.72
popped up i clicked on it

544.72 --> 548.8000000000001
never saw the guy before and you had it

546.72 --> 550.9590000000001
this whole conversation basically

548.8 --> 550.959
so

552.48 --> 557.519
and was funny enough he didn't know that

555.12 --> 560.0
much about mother's day want to do

557.519 --> 562.08
so i was asking him these very specific

560.0 --> 564.8
questions and he was just giving

562.08 --> 565.76
his overall gamer of like the last 10

564.8 --> 567.4399999999999
years

565.76 --> 569.04
type of opinion and that i really

567.44 --> 571.44
noticed uh

569.04 --> 573.76
it's funny for me it was an interesting

571.44 --> 576.8000000000001
experience

573.76 --> 578.08
yeah sounds whoa arwen is talking to

576.8 --> 580.16
somebody

578.08 --> 581.6800000000001
random and now that's an interesting

580.16 --> 585.92
experience yeah yeah

581.68 --> 585.92
because i really don't do it that often

586.0 --> 592.399
i rarely find a good angle to really in

589.6 --> 592.399
an outsider

593.04 --> 596.7199999999999
because i just think about conspiracy

595.44 --> 600.48
things and

596.72 --> 603.279
ethereal things yeah

600.48 --> 604.32
and a lot of people yeah they really

603.279 --> 607.68
have to

604.32 --> 608.24
like that and then be in the mood for

607.68 --> 611.8389999999999
that or

608.24 --> 615.12
have a place for that yeah so i usually

611.839 --> 618.1600000000001
don't really talk to people a lot

615.12 --> 620.88
outsiders outsiders

618.16 --> 622.3199999999999
outside of the flat earth now outside of

620.88 --> 624.88
youtube

622.32 --> 627.12
and skype outside of the internet pretty

624.88 --> 627.12
much

629.839 --> 635.0400000000001
but it was good uh

635.12 --> 639.04
right uh here we have some

639.92 --> 644.3199999999999
lift the feel at this weird little

641.6 --> 647.6
hangout but i don't know man

644.32 --> 648.88
but apparently somebody supposedly came

647.6 --> 652.0790000000001
out that they were

648.88 --> 652.8
cute just immediately had like ah come

652.079 --> 656.959
on

652.8 --> 659.5999999999999
really but apparently

656.959 --> 660.0
that's sort of happened i think it's

659.6 --> 663.279
probably

660.0 --> 665.36
a dud but who knows maybe they

663.279 --> 668.399
are like a segment because it's

665.36 --> 672.24
obviously not as individual

668.399 --> 675.279
but anyway uh and iron rail media was

672.24 --> 680.5600000000001
on later

675.279 --> 683.36
oh god here we go again this guy again

680.56 --> 685.8389999999999
is bothering me in my chat about it too

683.36 --> 687.92
yeah i did time you out

685.839 --> 690.1600000000001
because you were asserting that

687.92 --> 691.92
cavendish was an experiment

690.16 --> 694.24
and it's not it's not a scientific

691.92 --> 698.0
experiment you could call it a

694.24 --> 700.72
test but there's not being proven

698.0 --> 702.079
the cause of any effect so it's not an

700.72 --> 705.12
actual experiment

702.079 --> 705.12
you can't call it that

706.079 --> 713.279
right and whatever you're going to say

709.6 --> 716.8000000000001
that it supposedly proves it's not

713.279 --> 719.4399999999999
even designed to do that

716.8 --> 719.8389999999999
the mass attracting mass part right

719.44 --> 721.519
right

719.839 --> 723.9200000000001
because that's supposedly happening well

721.519 --> 727.36
the whole thing was designed

723.92 --> 729.76
to designate basically a weight

727.36 --> 731.92
to the earth that's literally what it's

729.76 --> 734.959
officially for so

731.92 --> 745.8389999999999
whatever you're going to say about it

734.959 --> 745.8389999999999
it's not what you think

748.84 --> 754.72
[Music]

750.56 --> 754.7199999999999
right immediately moving on to the next

755.279 --> 760.16
surprise surprise what's

758.48 --> 764.0
with the bow and a quiver on the wall

760.16 --> 764.0
well it's hanging there

766.0 --> 773.839
that's what it is

781.839 --> 785.6
hey michael jones yeah thank you for the

784.24 --> 789.76
paypal donation

785.6 --> 789.76
last night i really appreciate that

798.16 --> 801.8389999999999
another question i didn't answer what is

801.2 --> 804.9590000000001
there any

801.839 --> 807.6800000000001
relevance to my answer to what's with

804.959 --> 810.3199999999999
the bow in the quiver

807.68 --> 812.2399999999999
is it really that important it's a bow

810.32 --> 814.9590000000001
and a quiver

812.24 --> 817.6
they're real but i'm hanging there

814.959 --> 820.6389999999999
pretty much as a prop

817.6 --> 824.399
and since i have a

820.639 --> 825.44
i don't know a name association with the

824.399 --> 828.88
elves

825.44 --> 832.0
well they like bows and

828.88 --> 834.8
so yeah it's a prop

832.0 --> 834.8
it's a bow

839.6 --> 843.839
what do you want from me

853.68 --> 858.2399999999999
the proof isn't utilized with it well

856.639 --> 862.639
look if you're going to claim

858.24 --> 862.639
scientifically that mass attracts mass

863.6 --> 866.72
then yeah you're going to have to prove

865.519 --> 870.48
that scientifically

866.72 --> 873.36
by proving a natural phenomenon

870.48 --> 873.9200000000001
the cause of it that is you have to

873.36 --> 876.16
prove

873.92 --> 877.68
what causes it by varying and manipulate

876.16 --> 880.48
it so

877.68 --> 880.4799999999999
good luck with that

881.279 --> 885.76
you know the housekeeping questions been

883.92 --> 888.56
out here

885.76 --> 889.12
for at least three years now i think

888.56 --> 891.68
what

889.12 --> 894.0
two years i don't know man time flies

891.68 --> 895.92
time is flying

894.0 --> 898.16
the debates have been going for so long

895.92 --> 900.24
but it's it's well established

898.16 --> 902.24
now you know so if there's any

900.24 --> 904.48
scientific evidence for gravity that you

902.24 --> 908.24
would like to present

904.48 --> 910.48
by formulating a valid hypothesis

908.24 --> 912.5600000000001
that would be interesting you would be

910.48 --> 916.24
the first to actually

912.56 --> 919.199
really try that because most yeah fumble

916.24 --> 921.04
very very badly they tend to refer to

919.199 --> 922.88
something they're read somewhere else

921.04 --> 923.5999999999999
that was sort of peer reviewed to be

922.88 --> 925.36
okay

923.6 --> 926.8000000000001
and then they think it's a valid

925.36 --> 931.44
experiment when it's

926.8 --> 935.199
not pseudoscience that's the problem

931.44 --> 938.0
so if you could actually

935.199 --> 939.199
devise a real experiment to prove

938.0 --> 942.48
gravity

939.199 --> 946.639
i'd be very interested i tried myself

942.48 --> 949.04
and i'm quite yeah apt

946.639 --> 949.839
when it comes to yeah physics concepts

949.04 --> 953.12
like that

949.839 --> 955.9200000000001
so i really tried but yeah there's just

953.12 --> 958.16
these problems with it

955.92 --> 960.24
mainly that it's an aberration that that

958.16 --> 961.4399999999999
was my eventual conclusion it's an

960.24 --> 964.0790000000001
aberration because this

961.44 --> 965.839
it's tied together from several

964.079 --> 970.16
different

965.839 --> 973.1990000000001
phenomenon phenomena that can be

970.16 --> 976.24
very well explained by more

973.199 --> 979.92
scientifically valid effect

976.24 --> 982.88
things like for example relative density

979.92 --> 985.279
most of the effects can be explained

982.88 --> 988.88
through relative density even modeled

985.279 --> 991.759
pretty much but i'm not into that

988.88 --> 992.56
but i know it's possible like i did a

991.759 --> 996.0
hangout with

992.56 --> 998.16
the tony sleeping warrior the other day

996.0 --> 1000.48
or the other day it's months ago now

998.16 --> 1002.88
where we were basically discussing that

1000.48 --> 1004.5600000000001
and that's how i came to the eventual

1002.88 --> 1006.639
conclusion

1004.56 --> 1007.8389999999999
presented in a more mathematical model

1006.639 --> 1011.199
sense

1007.839 --> 1013.1990000000001
the the density differential

1011.199 --> 1016.0
it's all about the density differential

1013.199 --> 1019.04
between the object and the medium

1016.0 --> 1022.16
and that is what causes yeah

1019.04 --> 1024.0
a force or a lack thereof depending on

1022.16 --> 1027.439
the relation between the different

1024.0 --> 1031.839
yeah between the two the differential

1027.439 --> 1031.8390000000002
and what it looks like you can basically

1032.16 --> 1035.919
describe that numerically if you like

1034.959 --> 1038.559
but

1035.919 --> 1039.439
yeah this is this turns out to be the

1038.559 --> 1042.319
scientifically

1039.439 --> 1045.52
valid proven cause of all the phenomena

1042.319 --> 1047.6
associated with gravity

1045.52 --> 1049.2
the ones that are not just completely

1047.6 --> 1052.1599999999999
conjured out of thin or

1049.2 --> 1052.799
thin air based on many presuppositions

1052.16 --> 1056.16
out there

1052.799 --> 1058.24
like the earth being a sphere like that

1056.16 --> 1059.6000000000001
there's such a thing possible as gas

1058.24 --> 1061.76
pressure

1059.6 --> 1062.799
without a container on the earth versus

1061.76 --> 1067.2
the outer space

1062.799 --> 1068.8799999999999
all that

1067.2 --> 1071.1200000000001
yeah that's all presuppositional

1068.88 --> 1074.3200000000002
nonsense so it's completely

1071.12 --> 1077.6
irrelevant to the phenomena that are

1074.32 --> 1080.1599999999999
ascribed to gravity here on earth

1077.6 --> 1081.76
that are there they're there there's

1080.16 --> 1085.28
these things happening things

1081.76 --> 1086.559
heavy things fall healing balloons go up

1085.28 --> 1089.9189999999999
there's not so much mention

1086.559 --> 1091.12
right but all that there are things here

1089.919 --> 1095.5200000000002
on earth you can do

1091.12 --> 1098.08
and test that are ascribed to gravity

1095.52 --> 1100.4
but the way gravity is described

1098.08 --> 1104.24
mathematically

1100.4 --> 1104.24
simply does not add up

1105.36 --> 1109.36
so if you don't then go take all these

1108.559 --> 1111.039
phenomena

1109.36 --> 1113.4399999999998
and you're going to analyze them

1111.039 --> 1114.4
separately and cross-reference them with

1113.44 --> 1116.799
other concepts

1114.4 --> 1118.0
like relative density you'll find out it

1116.799 --> 1121.039
all works out

1118.0 --> 1123.52
works out brilliantly

1121.039 --> 1124.16
so that was my eventual conclusion on my

1123.52 --> 1127.52
quest

1124.16 --> 1130.64
to figure out gravity it's an aberration

1127.52 --> 1132.72
it's a ghost a mathematical

1130.64 --> 1135.039
dream that is placed over several

1132.72 --> 1138.48
phenomena that are actually

1135.039 --> 1142.0
explained by other concepts much more

1138.48 --> 1144.24
easy and provable

1142.0 --> 1144.24
so

1146.48 --> 1151.84
right there you go

1153.2 --> 1157.919
nothing can ever be scientifically

1155.52 --> 1160.76
proven only disproven yeah

1157.919 --> 1162.48
that's a very nice phyllis philosophy

1160.76 --> 1164.4
extrapolation

1162.48 --> 1166.32
bit that you didn't understand and

1164.4 --> 1168.96
that's now very popular

1166.32 --> 1171.6789999999999
double speak thing to say these days

1168.96 --> 1173.76
it's absolute nonsense though

1171.679 --> 1176.0800000000002
because by if you realize even what

1173.76 --> 1177.6
you're saying when you say that

1176.08 --> 1179.76
when you say that you're basically

1177.6 --> 1182.6399999999999
saying everything

1179.76 --> 1184.72
you in your vernacular in your way of

1182.64 --> 1187.76
thinking ascribe to science

1184.72 --> 1193.27
is not actually proof that's what you're

1187.76 --> 1196.41
saying but you don't even realize it

1193.27 --> 1196.41
[Music]

1211.52 --> 1221.84
hey vegan bear lots of people lots of

activity in chat

1223.76 --> 1230.24
zeno paradox

1227.039 --> 1234.4
specific infrastructure what what does

1230.24 --> 1238.799
that mean

1234.4 --> 1242.24
slowly picking up this comment

1238.799 --> 1246.1589999999999
from three minutes ago what if i had a

1242.24 --> 1248.24
self i it would say f3 is wasting

1246.159 --> 1249.679
his time and energy attempting to

1248.24 --> 1253.44
traverse irwin's

1249.679 --> 1253.44
xeno paradox

1253.6 --> 1260.0
not with an x but with a z

1256.72 --> 1263.039
probably ending in scissor

1260.0 --> 1265.76
frustration what is that i

1263.039 --> 1267.6
recognize the word so it was sisyphus

1265.76 --> 1269.78
right

1267.6 --> 1272.8999999999999
what does it

1269.78 --> 1272.8999999999999
[Music]

1274.159 --> 1279.44
oh never can be completed hmm

1279.679 --> 1285.2
right it's a long time ago since i last

1282.0 --> 1285.2
heard that word interesting

1288.799 --> 1292.6399999999999
but what is the zeno paradox

1301.76 --> 1306.32
god is this some new mathematical thing

1307.2 --> 1313.039
let's see xenoparadoxes oh there are

1310.48 --> 1313.039
multiple

1315.2 --> 1319.3600000000001
philosophical problems generally thought

1317.6 --> 1321.52
to have been devised by greek

1319.36 --> 1324.0
philosopher zeno

1321.52 --> 1324.0
okay

1324.33 --> 1328.48
[Music]

1326.159 --> 1330.8400000000001
doctrine that contrary to evidence of

1328.48 --> 1333.679
one's senses

1330.84 --> 1337.36
hmm wow dude you really

1333.679 --> 1337.3600000000001
freaking studied up on this [ __ ]

1337.76 --> 1347.84
hasten slowly dude

1357.039 --> 1362.32
like i'm really impressed because i get

1360.4 --> 1364.64
it i had to look up some of these words

1362.32 --> 1364.6399999999999
though

1370.64 --> 1376.88
although i don't see how it's my zeno

1374.24 --> 1380.24
paradox

1376.88 --> 1383.6000000000001
how what what xenoparadox

1380.24 --> 1387.36
is mine like

1383.6 --> 1390.32
i i've tried to specifically not do that

1387.36 --> 1392.32
and always only latch on to things that

1390.32 --> 1395.28
could be disproven

1392.32 --> 1396.559
and then just leave the rest open for

1395.28 --> 1399.6789999999999
ideas

1396.559 --> 1403.44
you know and i've always been very

1399.679 --> 1406.5590000000002
like nervously holding on

1403.44 --> 1408.72
to the looping concept because it's

1406.559 --> 1411.84
apparently not very popular

1408.72 --> 1413.84
even among flat earthers or maybe

1411.84 --> 1416.6399999999999
not or maybe people just don't get it or

1413.84 --> 1417.84
think it's too weird but i've always

1416.64 --> 1419.919
said like

1417.84 --> 1421.4399999999998
why i'm holding on to it and not just

1419.919 --> 1423.1200000000001
saying like oh this is just like

1421.44 --> 1426.0
space-time banning or something

1423.12 --> 1428.559
no no no no because it could be

1426.0 --> 1432.4
falsified but that it could be

1428.559 --> 1435.84
the case that it is here

1432.4 --> 1438.3200000000002
but it's not scientifically provable

1435.84 --> 1440.0
just like shape it's not scientifically

1438.32 --> 1443.279
provable but it could be

1440.0 --> 1447.2
very well deduced in

1443.279 --> 1449.679
ways that you eventually end up with an

1447.2 --> 1451.6000000000001
occam's razor situation

1449.679 --> 1454.0800000000002
and when people are going to say oh

1451.6 --> 1456.0
warping this or some special super

1454.08 --> 1459.84
effect or something

1456.0 --> 1460.559
versus no it's just interconnected space

1459.84 --> 1464.24
this space

1460.559 --> 1466.08
is just uniform and it explains

1464.24 --> 1467.6
how there doesn't need to be a container

1466.08 --> 1470.1589999999999
wall

1467.6 --> 1471.1999999999998
on the side because it's pushing against

1470.159 --> 1473.679
itself

1471.2 --> 1475.52
sealed like that cannot be like that on

1473.679 --> 1476.88
the top because yeah the bottom is

1475.52 --> 1479.679
obviously

1476.88 --> 1480.48
yeah it's the earth but who yeah

1479.679 --> 1484.96
whatever

1480.48 --> 1486.159
so eventually that would be the simplest

1484.96 --> 1489.679
solution

1486.159 --> 1490.5590000000002
if that turns out to be the case that

1489.679 --> 1492.5590000000002
there is

1490.559 --> 1494.8799999999999
something weird with with how land

1492.559 --> 1496.72
masses are interconnected

1494.88 --> 1498.88
and that if you move in a literal

1496.72 --> 1503.1200000000001
geometrical straight line

1498.88 --> 1505.1200000000001
you would end up in the same location

1503.12 --> 1506.1589999999999
or if you do that in an arc and not a

1505.12 --> 1508.3999999999999
full circle

1506.159 --> 1509.5200000000002
all these things the orientation and

1508.4 --> 1511.6000000000001
it's not about

1509.52 --> 1513.76
that it has been derived from celestial

1511.6 --> 1515.76
bodies because the celestial body

1513.76 --> 1518.48
orientation

1515.76 --> 1519.6
doesn't really change in its standard

1518.48 --> 1523.2
pathways

1519.6 --> 1526.32
so that predictability is what made

1523.2 --> 1528.24
map makers make their maps

1526.32 --> 1530.24
dependent on the celestial bodies

1528.24 --> 1531.76
because they are always in the same

1530.24 --> 1535.76
trajectories

1531.76 --> 1538.8799999999999
right so there is an

1535.76 --> 1542.08
a conjured concept of an equator line

1538.88 --> 1545.279
but yeah it is said to be throughout

1542.08 --> 1546.96
the earth realm so it's a good vantage

1545.279 --> 1550.32
point to start

1546.96 --> 1552.48
literally physically measuring how

1550.32 --> 1554.6399999999999
is this interconnected is it moving in a

1552.48 --> 1557.3600000000001
circle when you go past it

1554.64 --> 1560.4
or is it an incomplete circle something

1557.36 --> 1563.6
where very weird would be going on

1560.4 --> 1564.0
or is it indeed a perfect straight line

1563.6 --> 1566.8799999999999
which

1564.0 --> 1567.279
yeah how do you explain that if it's if

1566.88 --> 1569.6000000000001
it's

1567.279 --> 1571.039
perfectly geometrical flat straight line

1569.6 --> 1573.6
like a perfect

1571.039 --> 1575.12
looping in on itself line how line how

1573.6 --> 1579.039
other do you explain that

1575.12 --> 1581.6789999999999
then by just saying it's

1579.039 --> 1583.44
interconnected in a looping way

1581.679 --> 1586.3200000000002
otherwise you would have to say

1583.44 --> 1586.72
the alternative explanation would be

1586.32 --> 1590.799
much

1586.72 --> 1594.88
freakier and that is saying that

1590.799 --> 1596.72
straight is not straight it's curved

1594.88 --> 1601.2
something like that see that would be

1596.72 --> 1601.2
the alternative route to try to avoid

1601.44 --> 1606.24
clamping down on the concept of a

1603.76 --> 1608.8799999999999
looping interconnected space

1606.24 --> 1609.919
well i'm yeah this is almost like a

1608.88 --> 1612.64
debate stage

1609.919 --> 1613.3600000000001
discussion maybe in the future if it if

1612.64 --> 1616.0
anything

1613.36 --> 1618.08
like this would ever be established

1616.0 --> 1622.64
which i'm hoping for so much

1618.08 --> 1626.48
or to somebody just ramming that literal

1622.64 --> 1626.7990000000002
ring in my face like it is a litter ring

1626.48 --> 1630.48
we

1626.799 --> 1634.4
literally measured it piece by piece

1630.48 --> 1636.88
with physical rulers and lasers and

1634.4 --> 1638.0800000000002
everything so perfectly confirmed this

1636.88 --> 1640.96
is like we know

1638.08 --> 1642.48
it is a perfectly geometrical

1640.96 --> 1645.76
interlocking ring

1642.48 --> 1649.76
and that is what it is and then i'd be

1645.76 --> 1652.799
crap but it's not the end yet because

1649.76 --> 1653.44
yeah could we do the same for more to

1652.799 --> 1657.279
the north

1653.44 --> 1659.039
or to the south is it a literal disc

1657.279 --> 1660.799
or something else going on it's the

1659.039 --> 1661.6
starting point i'm not giving up that

1660.799 --> 1664.399
easily

1661.6 --> 1665.4399999999998
you know within my conceptions because

1664.399 --> 1669.12
there could still be

1665.44 --> 1671.3600000000001
non-linear stuff going on i just want to

1669.12 --> 1674.399
completely exclude that every point

1671.36 --> 1679.039
and basically show yes it is a

1674.399 --> 1681.36
perfect perfect euclidean

1679.039 --> 1683.039
disc pizza whatever you're going to call

1681.36 --> 1684.559
it and it's perfectly literal there's

1683.039 --> 1687.36
nothing weird going on

1684.559 --> 1688.08
it all interlocked perfectly like a

1687.36 --> 1691.36
pizza

1688.08 --> 1692.6399999999999
perfectly okay if that might be that

1691.36 --> 1694.9599999999998
might be the case

1692.64 --> 1696.7990000000002
kind of skeptical but if it is the case

1694.96 --> 1699.679
then i i want

1696.799 --> 1701.2
to literally see it measured out because

1699.679 --> 1701.76
otherwise i'm not just going to give it

1701.2 --> 1704.159
up

1701.76 --> 1704.1589999999999
like that

1705.6 --> 1716.1589999999999
right call me stubborn

1711.2 --> 1716.159
this is what i want i want to

1716.96 --> 1720.08
yeah i don't want to know for sure is it

1719.2 --> 1722.32
a disc

1720.08 --> 1724.0
let's find proof that it is a disc no

1722.32 --> 1727.6
i'm set out to disprove

1724.0 --> 1730.559
the disc and finding alternative

1727.6 --> 1732.559
conceptions in order to latch onto

1730.559 --> 1733.279
something else in order to keep a

1732.559 --> 1736.84
neutral

1733.279 --> 1738.0
mind versus the disc a skeptical mind to

1736.84 --> 1741.9189999999999
ensure

1738.0 --> 1745.12
then we're not being fooled again

1741.919 --> 1748.3200000000002
by people that handed down the concept

1745.12 --> 1749.12
as a prefab to some people it became

1748.32 --> 1751.039
occulted

1749.12 --> 1753.6789999999999
then we're curious why did they occult

1751.039 --> 1755.2
it did these people discover something

1753.679 --> 1758.3200000000002
or where they handed that

1755.2 --> 1760.0800000000002
those discoveries and then they there

1758.32 --> 1763.12
was something weird with it

1760.08 --> 1765.279
they were like erased or yeah something

1763.12 --> 1766.7199999999998
suspicious was came out of that

1765.279 --> 1768.24
well that's going to trigger people

1766.72 --> 1769.76
they're going to mistake that those

1768.24 --> 1772.0
people that were disappeared or

1769.76 --> 1775.84
something were the creators and then

1772.0 --> 1775.84
yeah that's a possibility

1776.32 --> 1780.72
right that's technically a possibility

1779.279 --> 1782.799
every time

1780.72 --> 1784.559
so if you want to know for sure you

1782.799 --> 1786.399
can't just go with something that

1784.559 --> 1789.44
somebody did

1786.399 --> 1790.1589999999999
you have to measure it out you have to

1789.44 --> 1794.48
confirm

1790.159 --> 1797.6000000000001
is this literally the case

1794.48 --> 1799.84
if it is not what parts about it are

1797.6 --> 1802.1589999999999
literally the case and what parts about

1799.84 --> 1804.399
it are not

1802.159 --> 1806.5590000000002
and what is the case then with those

1804.399 --> 1809.12
parts that are not

1806.559 --> 1811.039
that's how you get to the real truth of

1809.12 --> 1815.039
things

1811.039 --> 1818.08
right what about a cube

1815.039 --> 1818.08
well what about a cube

1818.24 --> 1825.6
inside the celestial sphere what

1822.32 --> 1828.4399999999998
what do you mean q and what do you mean

1825.6 --> 1830.6399999999999
inside a celestial sphere

1828.44 --> 1833.039
[Music]

1830.64 --> 1834.8400000000001
that's a when you say inside that

1833.039 --> 1837.279
suggests

1834.84 --> 1840.72
like spatially

1837.279 --> 1842.24
literally geometrically in relation to

1840.72 --> 1844.64
one another and i don't think the

1842.24 --> 1847.84
celestial sphere is physically

1844.64 --> 1850.24
in a 3d realm it's just a light

1847.84 --> 1851.9189999999999
manifestation you might consider that it

1850.24 --> 1853.6
might be in a fourth dimension or

1851.919 --> 1865.8400000000001
something like that

1853.6 --> 1865.84
but you can never physically prove that

1866.399 --> 1870.32
beside a sphere or a circle

1870.72 --> 1878.24
well if you're gonna go with a

1874.399 --> 1881.36
sphere or a cube or any kind of dice

1878.24 --> 1886.64
shape right that's all

1881.36 --> 1890.4799999999998
excluded because it's flat

1886.64 --> 1893.44
now however that flatness interlocks

1890.48 --> 1894.799
with itself if you can take

1893.44 --> 1897.6000000000001
considerations that

1894.799 --> 1898.08
space might be looping in certain ways

1897.6 --> 1900.8799999999999
or

1898.08 --> 1902.559
yeah not entirely linear remember my

1900.88 --> 1904.88
original

1902.559 --> 1906.799
channel statement space is not linear

1904.88 --> 1907.44
right well that's what i've been talking

1906.799 --> 1909.36
about

1907.44 --> 1910.88
that option that possibility well if you

1909.36 --> 1913.84
consider that if you take that

1910.88 --> 1913.8400000000001
consideration

1913.919 --> 1918.3200000000002
and then measure out how everything is

1916.0 --> 1921.039
well who knows what you end up with

1918.32 --> 1924.96
it might be like a almost like a paper

1921.039 --> 1924.96
cut out maybe it is like a cross

1925.6 --> 1930.7199999999998
like it's literally flat but it's almost

1927.6 --> 1933.36
like a a paper cut out of a cross

1930.72 --> 1935.44
that you could fold into a cube and it

1933.36 --> 1936.799
would even interconnect looping wise

1935.44 --> 1940.0
like that

1936.799 --> 1943.519
but it's literally flat

1940.0 --> 1946.64
right so these are potential

1943.519 --> 1947.679
yeah surreal-like options that are based

1946.64 --> 1951.039
on

1947.679 --> 1953.519
spatial non-linear considerations

1951.039 --> 1955.519
things that become possible when space

1953.519 --> 1957.84
turns out not to be linear within the

1955.519 --> 1961.2
design of this realm

1957.84 --> 1962.48
but yeah it's all about confirmation

1961.2 --> 1964.48
it's all about actually

1962.48 --> 1966.0
testing the orientation of the land

1964.48 --> 1969.3600000000001
segments and all that

1966.0 --> 1970.24
the relation to one another what

1969.36 --> 1974.7199999999998
location is

1970.24 --> 1974.72
where on in a euclidean

1974.84 --> 1978.8799999999999
sense

1976.64 --> 1978.88
right

1985.41 --> 1990.24
[Music]

1987.279 --> 1991.279
start answering questions to get paid

1990.24 --> 1996.88
yeah but that

1991.279 --> 1996.88
what what the [ __ ]

1997.6 --> 2006.559
f3 stop motion are you serious

2004.88 --> 2008.7990000000002
are you you're saying that i'm a

2006.559 --> 2010.24
freaking satan worshiper are you [ __ ]

2008.799 --> 2012.32
out of your mind man

2010.24 --> 2013.76
have you never seen the flower of life

2012.32 --> 2019.84
dude

2013.76 --> 2019.84
i've never seen the flower alive do you

2021.6 --> 2025.1999999999998
now this might just be an honest

2023.76 --> 2028.24
squirters mistake here

2025.2 --> 2030.8400000000001
it might just be freaking dumb i kind of

2028.24 --> 2034.72
think he is because he hasn't

2030.84 --> 2035.519
really been even creative in his retreat

2034.72 --> 2038.48
rebuttals

2035.519 --> 2040.159
that shows that he's not as apt as a

2038.48 --> 2044.84
high standard baller

2040.159 --> 2047.8400000000001
wizard so i think he's a bit

2044.84 --> 2047.84
dumb

2049.76 --> 2061.8390000000004
no you're not bending it if you do that

2052.0 --> 2061.839
i'm taking away your wrench

2065.2 --> 2075.839
so i'd like to hear a rebuttal now

2091.839 --> 2098.56
okay well why would you then assume

2095.839 --> 2101.2
that some pendant somebody's wearing is

2098.56 --> 2103.119
automatically satanic

2101.2 --> 2104.7999999999997
what is it written in the bible that you

2103.119 --> 2107.92
can never wear anything

2104.8 --> 2111.76
silver around your neck is that

2107.92 --> 2117.839
evil where are you getting this

2111.76 --> 2117.8390000000004
conclusion from

2122.079 --> 2131.8390000000004
i'm talking to f3 stop motion and ball

2149.04 --> 2154.32
so f3 stop motion do you actually know

2152.0 --> 2158.24
anything about symbols or about

2154.32 --> 2159.92
satanism or or what the why have you

2158.24 --> 2163.359
ever read the bible even

2159.92 --> 2166.48
right or did you just

2163.359 --> 2169.44
squirt watching a lot of like attention

2166.48 --> 2172.48
grabby scary satanist youtube video

2169.44 --> 2175.52
conspiracy theorists whatever

2172.48 --> 2176.8
what is it because that would make sense

2175.52 --> 2179.839
because when you watch those

2176.8 --> 2182.1600000000003
yeah everything becomes a satanist right

2179.839 --> 2184.48
that would explain some things here

2182.16 --> 2187.52
otherwise i i don't know why you would

2184.48 --> 2190.32
say in my chat

2187.52 --> 2190.32
that yeah

2196.8 --> 2200.5600000000004
what is that necklace it's a silver

2199.44 --> 2204.2400000000002
pendant

2200.56 --> 2208.7999999999997
that i myself made it's pure silver

2204.24 --> 2208.7999999999997
and i engraved the flower of life on it

2212.079 --> 2219.119
okay i guess i could show it huh

2215.76 --> 2221.92
it's getting a bit rusty because

2219.119 --> 2223.52
pure silver does oxidize it does respond

2221.92 --> 2227.04
to like

2223.52 --> 2230.24
uh to your sweat and everything

2227.04 --> 2230.24
but anyway here it is

2233.04 --> 2238.88
come on you see the pattern

2239.44 --> 2244.7200000000003
i don't know if you guys can see this i

2241.52 --> 2246.96
cannot see this well

2244.72 --> 2246.9599999999996
right

2248.96 --> 2257.839
right anyway

2258.67 --> 2262.16
[Music]

2260.16 --> 2263.5989999999997
yeah you never know well that's usually

2262.16 --> 2265.68
because

2263.599 --> 2266.6400000000003
it's not always on camera it's sometimes

2265.68 --> 2269.5989999999997
just right

2266.64 --> 2271.0499999999997
off camera so it doesn't always stand

2269.599 --> 2274.1890000000003
out

2271.05 --> 2274.1890000000003
[Music]

2285.52 --> 2289.52
now every stop motion my issue is why

2288.16 --> 2292.3199999999997
would you

2289.52 --> 2294.8
oh okay thank you for the super chat

2292.32 --> 2294.8
donation

2295.28 --> 2299.8390000000004
all right see i didn't ban him and now i

2299.04 --> 2303.2799999999997
got five

2299.839 --> 2303.2799999999997
dollars isn't that just great

2304.56 --> 2308.0
it was another as i said it was probably

2307.76 --> 2313.0400000000004
an

2308.0 --> 2316.24
honest squirting mistake

2313.04 --> 2318.16
he's not a he's not a real baller troll

2316.24 --> 2319.1189999999997
if he was i would have banned him long

2318.16 --> 2322.3199999999997
time ago

2319.119 --> 2322.7200000000003
they have a very distinct frequency this

2322.32 --> 2324.96
guy

2322.72 --> 2326.3999999999996
is he's more like an a real baller

2324.96 --> 2329.68
believer

2326.4 --> 2331.92
and he's kind of new to the scene

2329.68 --> 2331.9199999999996
so

2332.8 --> 2337.119
yeah but thank you for the super chat

2334.48 --> 2339.92
donation i truly appreciate that

2337.119 --> 2342.0
no but my most of my issue is that why

2339.92 --> 2345.359
would you

2342.0 --> 2347.04
just think associate yeah like in

2345.359 --> 2348.7999999999997
general you don't want to associate with

2347.04 --> 2349.119
the satanist i get that but why would

2348.8 --> 2352.2400000000002
you

2349.119 --> 2352.6400000000003
assume that after everything we've been

2352.24 --> 2356.64
through

2352.64 --> 2358.8799999999997
pretty much that i'm satanist

2356.64 --> 2360.56
what about me would you associate with

2358.88 --> 2363.92
satanist

2360.56 --> 2369.839
i know i do wear a black sweater

2363.92 --> 2369.839
you know but other than that

2372.0 --> 2376.079
i've i've tried to be a very good

2374.72 --> 2378.7999999999997
christian

2376.079 --> 2382.079
as as well as i can with who i am and

2378.8 --> 2385.6800000000003
what i'm dealing with in my head

2382.079 --> 2389.92
and i'm trying to build

2385.68 --> 2390.8799999999997
and refine because that is what i think

2389.92 --> 2393.359
that's really

2390.88 --> 2393.359
the point

2394.8 --> 2398.0
so yeah i'm just wondering like what why

2397.28 --> 2401.2000000000003
would you

2398.0 --> 2403.68
bring that up but never mind

2401.2 --> 2403.68
it's okay

2404.64 --> 2408.319
one big pond band limit

2409.2 --> 2416.56
ban limit there is no ban limit

2414.8 --> 2418.96
there are simply just rules about

2416.56 --> 2418.96
banning

2419.92 --> 2426.96
and technically i only ban real trolls

2424.4 --> 2428.2400000000002
if you're a ball skeptic i'm not gonna

2426.96 --> 2431.92
ban you

2428.24 --> 2435.04
but if you prove that you're capable

2431.92 --> 2435.92
and not ashamed to lie in the face of

2435.04 --> 2438.72
everyone

2435.92 --> 2441.44
for personal reasons or other then i

2438.72 --> 2443.68
will definitely time you out at times

2441.44 --> 2445.2000000000003
if you double down on that get worse i

2443.68 --> 2447.7599999999998
will ban you

2445.2 --> 2449.52
so i technically just ban people for bad

2447.76 --> 2451.92
behavior

2449.52 --> 2453.04
but not for your belief or your

2451.92 --> 2456.0
inability to

2453.04 --> 2456.0
understand something

2456.319 --> 2459.44
but if you do understand it and you then

2458.72 --> 2462.3999999999996
on purpose

2459.44 --> 2463.92
ignore it for some political win then

2462.4 --> 2467.28
you got a problem

2463.92 --> 2471.119
because i do pick up on that

2467.28 --> 2475.0400000000004
i ban cleary could be

2471.119 --> 2475.04
cleary can be a real dick sometimes

2475.28 --> 2478.7200000000003
but maybe not i don't know

2479.52 --> 2482.16
is he bad

2485.839 --> 2490.16
i think he was just being very stupid

2488.24 --> 2494.0789999999997
and annoying

2490.16 --> 2496.8999999999996
about owen benjamin

2494.079 --> 2500.329
and i just don't want to hear that [ __ ]

2496.9 --> 2500.329
[Music]

2501.359 --> 2507.359
timeout not a bad oh yeah it could be

2504.64 --> 2509.839
i i rarely ban people these days come on

2507.359 --> 2509.839
guys

2512.16 --> 2515.68
and not not to say that it might not

2514.319 --> 2518.64
come back right

2515.68 --> 2519.44
i might i might just at some point crack

2518.64 --> 2522.48
down

2519.44 --> 2525.2000000000003
do a hard sweep if especially if people

2522.48 --> 2526.4
all get all frolicky and weird and lose

2525.2 --> 2529.1189999999997
their

2526.4 --> 2530.8
discipline right and those times do

2529.119 --> 2533.359
arrive

2530.8 --> 2535.3590000000004
i will do that but i don't know overall

2533.359 --> 2537.92
i'm kind of satisfied with the

2535.359 --> 2541.2799999999997
consistency of the chat

2537.92 --> 2544.48
and the understanding of people of what

2541.28 --> 2547.2000000000003
how to behave in chat and that it's more

2544.48 --> 2547.76
it's much more like a class and yeah not

2547.2 --> 2550.24
so much

2547.76 --> 2553.0400000000004
a kindergarten anymore and i really

2550.24 --> 2553.04
appreciate that

2559.52 --> 2562.839
crypto address is up so you can send

2561.92 --> 2566.7200000000003
directly

2562.839 --> 2566.72
what uh

2567.119 --> 2569.44
maybe

2571.119 --> 2574.6400000000003
but i don't really know what to do with

2572.88 --> 2576.88
that

2574.64 --> 2578.7999999999997
it would just be piling up might even

2576.88 --> 2581.76
get me into trouble

2578.8 --> 2582.8
you know i already have a crypto plan

2581.76 --> 2585.6800000000003
but it's separate

2582.8 --> 2587.52
it's not really open yeah and exactly

2585.68 --> 2589.52
like good servant says if you really

2587.52 --> 2592.16
want to support me

2589.52 --> 2594.4
and actually make sure and sure that it

2592.16 --> 2596.319
it gets in my pocket and doesn't

2594.4 --> 2598.64
disappear into some tax hole or

2596.319 --> 2601.44
something

2598.64 --> 2604.24
because i i live on social welfare

2601.44 --> 2604.2400000000002
unfortunately

2605.44 --> 2609.599
although i do have some income also

2607.68 --> 2611.2
especially through this

2609.599 --> 2612.96
through just the the google and the

2611.2 --> 2615.2
advertising income

2612.96 --> 2616.4
but it all disappears it just they just

2615.2 --> 2618.24
take it out again

2616.4 --> 2621.28
if you want to support me directly do it

2618.24 --> 2623.04
through paypal that works the best

2621.28 --> 2625.3590000000004
and the address is in the description

2623.04 --> 2625.359
box

2630.34 --> 2635.2000000000003
[Music]

2632.72 --> 2637.68
crypto addresses everyone can see your

2635.2 --> 2640.3999999999996
transaction

2637.68 --> 2643.04
right well i don't even have that too

2640.4 --> 2646.319
many transactions i have like a

2643.04 --> 2648.48
i'm on to a company that works with

2646.319 --> 2653.2
cryptocurrency and they're they are

2648.48 --> 2656.0
really on point with this [ __ ]

2653.2 --> 2657.839
like they yeah i've been looking at it

2656.0 --> 2660.72
from background my dad is really

2657.839 --> 2661.68
on top of it and he relays a lot of

2660.72 --> 2663.7599999999998
things

2661.68 --> 2665.9199999999996
that i can then cross reference from

2663.76 --> 2668.7200000000003
everything everywhere that i hear

2665.92 --> 2670.96
on social media and through all that

2668.72 --> 2672.7999999999997
right

2670.96 --> 2675.2
and i've come to the conclusion that

2672.8 --> 2680.0
they've got some really high tech

2675.2 --> 2681.839
guys that are basically maintaining it

2680.0 --> 2683.839
and it's working out great so far they

2681.839 --> 2684.56
haven't they haven't avoided all

2683.839 --> 2687.359
problems

2684.56 --> 2689.2
which is a good sign this is a good sign

2687.359 --> 2691.7599999999998
it means that they're being taken

2689.2 --> 2693.68
seriously and they've got like lawyer

2691.76 --> 2695.92
problems in the sense that there's all

2693.68 --> 2695.9199999999996
these

2696.56 --> 2701.44
lawyer groups that are funded by bankers

2701.68 --> 2706.3999999999996
that are lobbying to basically get them

2704.72 --> 2708.48
yeah to really they're really being

2706.4 --> 2708.96
attacked through judicial system and

2708.48 --> 2711.68
everything

2708.96 --> 2713.04
really it's all being kept silent you

2711.68 --> 2714.48
don't really hear about it in the papers

2713.04 --> 2716.839
they don't want anybody to know about

2714.48 --> 2719.68
that but it's happening

2716.839 --> 2721.2
and has been for some time but they're

2719.68 --> 2723.1189999999997
doing great and they have

2721.2 --> 2726.319
like products so it's literally like a

2723.119 --> 2728.96
company it works with cryptocurrency and

2726.319 --> 2730.88
it's almost like a decentralized banking

2728.96 --> 2732.88
system but you can't call it that

2730.88 --> 2734.1600000000003
that's why i'm not associating it with

2732.88 --> 2736.8
the name

2734.16 --> 2737.839
but it kind of feels like that it's very

2736.8 --> 2741.6800000000003
interesting what

2737.839 --> 2745.599
what's going on in there with all these

2741.68 --> 2749.2799999999997
things that are associating

2745.599 --> 2749.599
yeah but it's it's very remote from

2749.28 --> 2752.079
where

2749.599 --> 2754.2400000000002
my thailand talents lie when it comes to

2752.079 --> 2756.8
oversight on things so it's like kind of

2754.24 --> 2757.68
alien to me at this point but it's

2756.8 --> 2760.6400000000003
working out

2757.68 --> 2762.56
great there were some obstacles they

2760.64 --> 2765.68
were overcome

2762.56 --> 2766.0789999999997
and now i still have not went into the

2765.68 --> 2769.7599999999998
red

2766.079 --> 2769.76
it's still a basically a

2770.0 --> 2778.4
you call it

2774.56 --> 2780.64
a lossless investment it has been a pure

2778.4 --> 2782.7200000000003
lossless investment for me so far and

2780.64 --> 2786.16
that yeah

2782.72 --> 2789.1189999999997
what do i got to lose nothing no losses

2786.16 --> 2789.44
zero no investment losses it was free to

2789.119 --> 2792.8
me

2789.44 --> 2795.28
basically so

2792.8 --> 2796.0
but i'm keeping that pretty much to

2795.28 --> 2798.48
myself

2796.0 --> 2800.4
until i can until i suddenly it's going

2798.48 --> 2801.52
to be pretty suddenly when it happens i

2800.4 --> 2803.359
think

2801.52 --> 2804.96
because that that would be the way i do

2803.359 --> 2808.96
it that i certainly have

2804.96 --> 2812.0
like crypto available to do stuff with

2808.96 --> 2815.2
i don't know to what extent it could be

2812.0 --> 2817.04
a lot i don't know i don't know yet

2815.2 --> 2819.4399999999996
how much it'll turn out to be because

2817.04 --> 2821.599
it's this crypto land man it drives me

2819.44 --> 2823.52
nuts

2821.599 --> 2824.88
these values and the cross values and

2823.52 --> 2826.24
then the cross value with the cross

2824.88 --> 2829.119
value with that and that

2826.24 --> 2832.0789999999997
and that and oh then you know but it's

2829.119 --> 2834.0
all swinging around and ah

2832.079 --> 2836.319
getting cancelled the new one spawning

2834.0 --> 2841.359
up it's driving me nuts

2836.319 --> 2841.359
this is not my thing right

2842.839 --> 2845.839
no

2847.599 --> 2854.2400000000002
no no no i'm definitely gonna apply

2852.24 --> 2856.3999999999996
my knowledge to the flat earth because

2854.24 --> 2857.2799999999997
that is where most of my talents lie and

2856.4 --> 2859.04
i knew that

2857.28 --> 2861.119
every step of the way that i was

2859.04 --> 2864.88
confronted with anything like this

2861.119 --> 2867.92
world design i liked computer games

2864.88 --> 2870.88
because of world design because it

2867.92 --> 2873.119
that yeah that was the first thing that

2870.88 --> 2873.92
got close to easy modeling something

2873.119 --> 2877.839
like that

2873.92 --> 2879.119
and yeah cosmogeny is my thing i i'm

2877.839 --> 2881.68
just

2879.119 --> 2885.599
i'm destined they're cursed from some

2881.68 --> 2885.5989999999997
people's perspective to do this

2885.68 --> 2891.2
i can't help it it's just that right now

2888.96 --> 2894.0
there's a lot of attention to it so i

2891.2 --> 2895.4399999999996
it actually sort of can make it

2894.0 --> 2897.92
professional

2895.44 --> 2897.92
sort of

2898.72 --> 2901.839
this is what i want to do

2904.72 --> 2909.2
no that doesn't work like that at all

2907.359 --> 2909.92
first you get the money then you get the

2909.2 --> 2913.1189999999997
power

2909.92 --> 2916.8
oh really really you think that no

2913.119 --> 2919.52
no no if you're gonna get the money

2916.8 --> 2920.88
you're going to have to sign a lot of

2919.52 --> 2923.92
contracts

2920.88 --> 2925.839
that if you read very carefully and most

2923.92 --> 2928.0
people don't just like with computer

2925.839 --> 2931.04
programs you don't really read

2928.0 --> 2932.96
the entire notification thing because

2931.04 --> 2936.64
it's just

2932.96 --> 2938.559
very tedious it's insane amounts

2936.64 --> 2940.24
every time with every program but almost

2938.559 --> 2941.6800000000003
nobody reads that right but if you're

2940.24 --> 2945.2
gonna

2941.68 --> 2945.68
do business and get money and sign on to

2945.2 --> 2947.1189999999997
groups

2945.68 --> 2948.7999999999997
yeah you're going to find that you're

2947.119 --> 2951.04
going to have to exclude

2948.8 --> 2953.6800000000003
a lot of things and guess what's first

2951.04 --> 2956.88
excluded on the list

2953.68 --> 2959.7599999999998
flat earth yeah

2956.88 --> 2960.96
so you're not gonna get that money and

2959.76 --> 2963.44
then the power

2960.96 --> 2964.4
and then get back to flat earth because

2963.44 --> 2966.4
you can't

2964.4 --> 2967.44
because those contracts are not gonna go

2966.4 --> 2969.44
away

2967.44 --> 2971.839
if they do you're gonna get in real big

2969.44 --> 2971.839
trouble

2972.4 --> 2977.52
they will literally try to rip

2975.119 --> 2979.359
everything away from you again

2977.52 --> 2980.8
if you do that if you break those

2979.359 --> 2984.0789999999997
contracts

2980.8 --> 2987.76
so no that doesn't work like

2984.079 --> 2989.7200000000003
that that's even why i haven't been

2987.76 --> 2995.28
overly enthusiastic to

2989.72 --> 2999.52
re-engage with corporate society

2995.28 --> 3001.28
because i wanted to do this

2999.52 --> 3004.079
now if corporate society suddenly

3001.28 --> 3007.3590000000004
decides that it's perfectly fine

3004.079 --> 3009.2000000000003
to have i don't know a religion of flat

3007.359 --> 3009.839
earth you know it might be that [ __ ]

3009.2 --> 3012.72
that we

3009.839 --> 3013.119
just that it's no other way that they

3012.72 --> 3014.8799999999997
can

3013.119 --> 3017.28
accept it other than this is their

3014.88 --> 3019.52
religion and they'd see it as like our

3017.28 --> 3021.119
reversed world religion out there they

3019.52 --> 3022.64
they're the real satanists because they

3021.119 --> 3026.2400000000002
don't believe the earthly

3022.64 --> 3029.7599999999998
globally right right but that might

3026.24 --> 3031.52
be the only way that eventually it might

3029.76 --> 3033.44
from this vantage point where it's

3031.52 --> 3034.88
official be with this globe

3033.44 --> 3037.119
through everything through government

3034.88 --> 3038.96
through banks for corporations

3037.119 --> 3040.559
it might be the only way that i could

3038.96 --> 3042.96
ever

3040.559 --> 3045.119
not have to sign off completely and

3042.96 --> 3048.0
silence myself on flat earth

3045.119 --> 3049.839
with some kind of stupid hope that i

3048.0 --> 3052.079
would rise in the rank and then be able

3049.839 --> 3056.4
to talk about it again

3052.079 --> 3056.4
and it doesn't work like that so

3057.119 --> 3063.6800000000003
yeah no i'll just try to do it bottom up

3061.68 --> 3066.839
i'm i'm doing this grassroots i'm

3063.68 --> 3069.68
literally trying to survive

3066.839 --> 3072.5589999999997
grassroots yeah

3069.68 --> 3073.52
on government welfare but the minimum

3072.559 --> 3077.119
okay

3073.52 --> 3080.72
this is the thing listen carefully

3077.119 --> 3082.6400000000003
it is it seems almost like

3080.72 --> 3084.0789999999997
from certain perspectives or three

3082.64 --> 3086.16
perspectives like a

3084.079 --> 3088.319
useless vantage point where i am i'm

3086.16 --> 3089.68
just on basic social welfare that's the

3088.319 --> 3092.64
only thing

3089.68 --> 3093.839
only thing the basic of the basic the

3092.64 --> 3096.4
minimum package

3093.839 --> 3097.44
that's what i've oh i've never taken

3096.4 --> 3099.119
more

3097.44 --> 3101.599
unless there was some kind of emerging

3099.119 --> 3104.0
than like an emergency fund

3101.599 --> 3105.28
for medical things that happened one

3104.0 --> 3108.96
time

3105.28 --> 3111.2000000000003
but other than that minimum you know why

3108.96 --> 3113.52
because there are other people that also

3111.2 --> 3116.7999999999997
live on social welfare

3113.52 --> 3119.28
and they can't do that they

3116.8 --> 3120.76
i don't know why it baffles me every

3119.28 --> 3123.92
time they get on

3120.76 --> 3125.2000000000003
pharmaceuticals they they get on things

3123.92 --> 3128.319
they think they need to do

3125.2 --> 3130.319
and they got fully branched social

3128.319 --> 3132.5589999999997
welfare integration and people that

3130.319 --> 3136.0
constantly bother them

3132.559 --> 3138.3190000000004
terrible right

3136.0 --> 3139.52
well when i started to notice that that

3138.319 --> 3142.64
is a pattern

3139.52 --> 3145.119
i basically vowed i will never

3142.64 --> 3147.04
never grab more than just the minimum

3145.119 --> 3148.6400000000003
social welfare and i want to get out of

3147.04 --> 3152.16
this

3148.64 --> 3152.96
but it's working out fine they don't

3152.16 --> 3156.1189999999997
bother me

3152.96 --> 3158.7200000000003
you know why because it's in the dutch

3156.119 --> 3163.52
constitution

3158.72 --> 3166.24
as a spawn citizen with the right

3163.52 --> 3167.28
to a social welfare and that's

3166.24 --> 3170.0789999999997
constitution they

3167.28 --> 3172.0
can't do anything about it they can tell

3170.079 --> 3175.3590000000004
you you have to do [ __ ]

3172.0 --> 3178.559
but in actuality you don't

3175.359 --> 3180.88
but has consequence if you don't

3178.559 --> 3182.1600000000003
because you can't just squirm and

3180.88 --> 3185.359
scrabble and

3182.16 --> 3189.68
beg for more than that only works

3185.359 --> 3194.0789999999997
if you do do everything they say

3189.68 --> 3197.359
see that's why this works for me

3194.079 --> 3197.76
but i wanna grow i wanna extend i don't

3197.359 --> 3201.2
wanna

3197.76 --> 3204.88
be yeah

3201.2 --> 3208.16
sort of poor not really poor compared to

3204.88 --> 3212.079
third world countries when i'm like

3208.16 --> 3213.7599999999998
i feel isolated because i don't do a lot

3212.079 --> 3216.48
of things

3213.76 --> 3217.119
and yeah not having a lot of money is

3216.48 --> 3219.44
not very

3217.119 --> 3220.6400000000003
inviting to go out and meet people and

3219.44 --> 3225.2000000000003
[ __ ]

3220.64 --> 3228.24
for me because i like to be very

3225.2 --> 3228.24
giving and like

3228.319 --> 3233.7599999999998
my having money gives me confidence

3231.359 --> 3235.359
too much confidence at times even right

3233.76 --> 3236.0
and i've had issues with that as i

3235.359 --> 3238.72
shared i don't

3236.0 --> 3240.48
like what it does with me some yet but

3238.72 --> 3242.3999999999996
that's why i would never go for a big

3240.48 --> 3245.839
pile that would be terrible

3242.4 --> 3247.44
but i still yeah i'm in a position where

3245.839 --> 3247.7599999999998
i don't have a lot of money so i'm not

3247.44 --> 3250.4
i'm

3247.76 --> 3253.119
isolated to basically not accidentally

3250.4 --> 3255.52
spend too much

3253.119 --> 3256.96
and it works because that way i can

3255.52 --> 3260.8
focus a lot on my

3256.96 --> 3264.319
work on my thinking i literally spent

3260.8 --> 3266.079
hours a day sounds really ridiculous

3264.319 --> 3269.2
it's not really haunting but it's 10

3266.079 --> 3273.119
hours a day just walking back and forth

3269.2 --> 3275.2
back and forth thinking listening

3273.119 --> 3276.2400000000002
thinking more thinking more thinking

3275.2 --> 3278.0
more listening

3276.24 --> 3280.64
considering everything that's happening

3278.0 --> 3282.24
everything that has happened

3280.64 --> 3283.72
things that i've considered before

3282.24 --> 3285.7599999999998
reconsidering

3283.72 --> 3286.799
cross-referencing remodeling it in my

3285.76 --> 3290.0
head this

3286.799 --> 3292.559
is my full-time occupation it ra

3290.0 --> 3294.16
it requires more baffling amount of

3292.559 --> 3297.0400000000004
concentration

3294.16 --> 3299.44
to keep it all consistent and not like

3297.04 --> 3301.2
end up at a loss like i don't know what

3299.44 --> 3304.7200000000003
to do anymore with this

3301.2 --> 3304.72
and i've had those moments

3305.359 --> 3309.04
or i would like almost feel like i'm

3307.44 --> 3309.599
gonna crash i don't know what to do

3309.04 --> 3312.96
anymore

3309.599 --> 3316.48
on this on the show even sort of right

3312.96 --> 3317.2
but that's years ago now i've grown into

3316.48 --> 3320.88
this

3317.2 --> 3323.359
i understand now what i'm actually doing

3320.88 --> 3324.96
isn't that baffling i've been doing it

3323.359 --> 3327.2799999999997
but i'm getting to understand

3324.96 --> 3329.599
more and more what it actually is that

3327.28 --> 3332.3190000000004
i'm doing

3329.599 --> 3334.559
what it's doing with me what it's doing

3332.319 --> 3337.599
with other people

3334.559 --> 3339.76
and giving me some time to study other

3337.599 --> 3343.6800000000003
people more closely from a

3339.76 --> 3343.6800000000003
safe vantage point

3344.0 --> 3349.52
because for example here's a real life

3346.839 --> 3351.7599999999998
situation i'm very sensitive guy and the

3349.52 --> 3353.52
internet really does help like a barrier

3351.76 --> 3354.3190000000004
in a way because if you insult somebody

3353.52 --> 3359.04
on the internet

3354.319 --> 3360.64
it's it it's not that close

3359.04 --> 3362.5589999999997
it's not that shocking even if they get

3360.64 --> 3365.2799999999997
pissed off it might be consequences but

3362.559 --> 3367.2000000000003
you can easily keep your distance

3365.28 --> 3369.44
it's not shocking if you do that well if

3367.2 --> 3371.4399999999996
i do it in the real world i accidentally

3369.44 --> 3373.2000000000003
say something that insults somebody and

3371.44 --> 3376.4
they're really pissed off that's a real

3373.2 --> 3379.7599999999998
shocker to me

3376.4 --> 3384.559
like that it's a difference

3379.76 --> 3388.48
so this place gives me much more

3384.559 --> 3390.88
room for my mind to kind of

3388.48 --> 3392.799
well act in a way that in the

3390.88 --> 3394.7200000000003
face-to-face world would be kind of

3392.799 --> 3398.0
anti-social to do that

3394.72 --> 3399.839
right it would be kind of anti-social to

3398.0 --> 3402.0
be literally like we are here

3399.839 --> 3404.0789999999997
on the internet even for me and i'm

3402.0 --> 3406.799
trying to i'm a very decent person

3404.079 --> 3408.079
social like i freaking i opened that

3406.799 --> 3410.88
door for a lady you

3408.079 --> 3411.2000000000003
damn well better believe it that's [ __ ]

3410.88 --> 3415.04
i

3411.2 --> 3418.72
always say hello when somebody

3415.04 --> 3419.92
is is walking past me and looks at me

3418.72 --> 3423.839
always

3419.92 --> 3426.0
you have to do that i don't know

3423.839 --> 3428.5589999999997
it's a religious gentleman or something

3426.0 --> 3432.559
i this just this thing i need to do that

3428.559 --> 3437.8390000000004
it's healthy for me if i do that

3432.559 --> 3441.28
right so i can't be like this

3437.839 --> 3444.5589999999997
in face-to-face situations

3441.28 --> 3446.0
i'm much more silent and i know there's

3444.559 --> 3447.599
people that can attest to that the

3446.0 --> 3450.16
people that i've met

3447.599 --> 3451.76
at the amsterdam conference they've

3450.16 --> 3454.96
noticed this about me yeah when you

3451.76 --> 3457.6800000000003
break me open i get like this and

3454.96 --> 3459.04
but still i'm a little bit more like a

3457.68 --> 3462.16
little bit more nervous

3459.04 --> 3462.16
because i'm physically there

3462.72 --> 3465.5989999999997
that's the difference

3468.88 --> 3477.76
anyway talking a lot about myself today

3475.04 --> 3479.44
oh wow it's already three o'clock damn

3477.76 --> 3481.5200000000004
our time has flown

3479.44 --> 3482.88
i thought it was a good introspective

3481.52 --> 3485.359
hangout i've

3482.88 --> 3489.839
been very detailed and hey every stop

3485.359 --> 3489.839
motion is still here

3490.079 --> 3494.4
money can't buy happiness but poverty

3492.079 --> 3498.559
sucks so well that kind of makes it an

3494.4 --> 3501.44
even choice to me you know in ways

3498.559 --> 3502.0
the full realization is that every

3501.44 --> 3504.2400000000002
choice

3502.0 --> 3506.4
is an equal balanced out choice because

3504.24 --> 3507.7599999999998
god balances out the choice and that was

3506.4 --> 3509.76
one of the freakiest

3507.76 --> 3511.119
introspective realizations that i've

3509.76 --> 3515.0400000000004
ever

3511.119 --> 3516.48
encountered no that's during my freaking

3515.04 --> 3519.04
dark world experience

3516.48 --> 3521.599
was terrifying realizing that when

3519.04 --> 3521.599
you're in it

3522.319 --> 3526.96
yeah anyway i'm rounding out the show so

3524.96 --> 3528.88

i mixed it up again okay i'm staying a

3567.76 --> 3571.5200000000004
little bit longer

3569.119 --> 3572.96

3572.96 --> 3579.68
i'm going to do a half more hour so

3576.27 --> 3581.68
[Laughter]

3579.68 --> 3583.7599999999998
well at least i got an opportunity to

3581.68 --> 3587.839
round out that

3583.76 --> 3587.8390000000004
that talk needed a break from that

3591.04 --> 3597.599
right oh i'll hang a little bit more

3594.079 --> 3601.8390000000004
maybe yeah it's saturday what

3597.599 --> 3601.839
saturday oh dear

3601.88 --> 3615.839
[Music]

3612.839 --> 3615.839
hmm

3616.44 --> 3623.12
[Music]

3627.04 --> 3633.7599999999998
hmm right september

3630.4 --> 3635.119
well so the so was i i was very much

3633.76 --> 3639.76
like that before i

3635.119 --> 3643.04
got on the internet you know

3639.76 --> 3646.079
the thing is

3643.04 --> 3647.2799999999997
part of the reason why i do it is

3646.079 --> 3648.75
because of the

3647.28 --> 3651.28
personal

3648.75 --> 3654.48
[Music]

3651.28 --> 3657.2000000000003
therapeutical benefits

3654.48 --> 3659.68
because it does counter the loneliness

3657.2 --> 3662.96
it doesn't really do it perfectly

3659.68 --> 3666.16
gives you a yeah you can

3662.96 --> 3668.64
put out as much as you dare about you

3666.16 --> 3670.0
as much as you feel safe and i've opened

3668.64 --> 3672.64
up the doors

3670.0 --> 3672.64
completely

3676.079 --> 3678.319
so

3679.92 --> 3685.839
and that gives me just a lot of space as

3682.24 --> 3685.839
i explained

3686.88 --> 3691.52
do i shoot to go oh quickly move on to

3689.68 --> 3694.8799999999997
another more

3691.52 --> 3696.079
material subject uh no i don't really

3694.88 --> 3701.28
shoot the ball i have

3696.079 --> 3701.28
shot it in the past but

3710.839 --> 3717.599
now

3712.88 --> 3721.92
did karen be denied selenium

3717.599 --> 3721.92
as a globe falsification i don't know

3722.4 --> 3726.7200000000003
i'm not entirely sure what that means

3724.839 --> 3729.92
entirely

3726.72 --> 3729.9199999999996
hey yellow rest dad

3737.039 --> 3743.76
well saptapi that's all up to you

3740.799 --> 3743.7599999999998
that's the whole point

3744.24 --> 3748.3999999999996
the internet isn't genuine interaction

3746.799 --> 3751.599
well that's up to the purp

3748.4 --> 3754.0
the people that's the whole point i am

3751.599 --> 3756.799
doing a genuine

3754.0 --> 3758.799
and with that sort of breaking the

3756.799 --> 3762.4
normal

3758.799 --> 3762.4
and just being freaking honest

3763.52 --> 3770.079
and yeah that way

3766.64 --> 3772.319
i'm known and relied upon as honest and

3770.079 --> 3772.319
open

3774.72 --> 3779.68
and other people that

3777.92 --> 3781.52
think they can deal with that want to

3779.68 --> 3782.72
deal with that can approach that and

3781.52 --> 3784.88
deal with that and be

3782.72 --> 3786.799
open and honest and then reap the

3784.88 --> 3789.92
enormous benefits of

3786.799 --> 3793.44
actually doing that

3789.92 --> 3795.6800000000003
which was kind of originally the benefit

3793.44 --> 3797.28
of even like going to church before they

3795.68 --> 3800.799
turn into this freaking

3797.28 --> 3805.92
nonsense corona and ball

3800.799 --> 3808.24
earth indoctrination camps

3805.92 --> 3810.0
all that nonsense see it was all about

3808.24 --> 3812.24
the truth and what a relief it

3810.0 --> 3813.92
is to just be in the presence of truth

3812.24 --> 3816.799
and be part of it

3813.92 --> 3817.599
and reflect truthfully upon truthful

3816.799 --> 3825.839
things

3817.599 --> 3825.839
in yourself and others

3830.23 --> 3839.839
[Music]

3831.68 --> 3839.839
oh rest ahead looking for trouble again

3841.2 --> 3846.0
yeah he has a bit of a loud mouth that's

3843.599 --> 3846.0
correct

3846.88 --> 3852.6400000000003
but i already addressed all that earlier

3850.64 --> 3855.1189999999997
he actually super chatted though super

3852.64 --> 3855.1189999999997
chatted me

3857.76 --> 3862.559
oh god okay well uh look if you want to

3861.52 --> 3867.839
stay here

3862.559 --> 3867.8390000000004
f3 stop motion don't ban him ask that

3868.079 --> 3872.48
yeah don't do that

3875.839 --> 3879.359
don't address people in my chat like

3878.319 --> 3881.0389999999998
that

3879.359 --> 3883.52
especially since you're pretty much a

3881.039 --> 3885.92
newcomer here

3883.52 --> 3888.0
and obviously you don't know who rasta

3885.92 --> 3895.839
hat is because if you did you wouldn't

3888.0 --> 3895.839
say something like that

3897.36 --> 3900.4590000000003
[Music]

3902.48 --> 3905.68
come on the panel

3906.559 --> 3909.76
on the panel what i have to have him on

3908.88 --> 3911.839
the show really

3909.76 --> 3913.6800000000003
he would probably get on the show you

3911.839 --> 3918.4
know he's

3913.68 --> 3921.1189999999997
he's not really a completely

3918.4 --> 3922.079
full-on ballers just yet or has that

3921.119 --> 3925.44
he's a relative

3922.079 --> 3937.44
newcomer it's just

3925.44 --> 3940.7200000000003
started out with the ball

3937.44 --> 3941.839
okay well technically look if he wants

3940.72 --> 3944.5589999999997
to

3941.839 --> 3944.88
the way to do it is contact me on skype

3944.559 --> 3946.7200000000003
it's

3944.88 --> 3949.119
it's literally the first thing you see

3946.72 --> 3951.359
in the description box

3949.119 --> 3953.44
that's the address add me on skype and

3951.359 --> 3953.68
then yeah i could potentially call you

3953.44 --> 3958.2400000000002
in

3953.68 --> 3958.24
if you like if you think you're up for

3962.839 --> 3965.839
that

3973.839 --> 3979.839
i don't know what that means but thank

3975.52 --> 3979.839
you for the super chat donation

3981.0 --> 3985.28
[Music]

3982.88 --> 3993.839
oh okay that sounds good it's over

3985.28 --> 3993.8390000000004
trafficking arrested

4012.4 --> 4021.839
right mark collard no he doesn't sound

4015.359 --> 4021.839
like brenda at all

4022.4 --> 4026.48
muscle mass well

4026.72 --> 4033.68
i don't know i've always just been like

4030.079 --> 4034.96
my muscle mass isn't that bad come on

4033.68 --> 4039.0389999999998
yeah

4034.96 --> 4041.28
look i'm not like a super muscly guy but

4039.039 --> 4043.6800000000003
it's not that bad so i've always been

4041.28 --> 4043.6800000000003
like this

4044.64 --> 4048.72
yeah i can get a little bit more muscly

4046.799 --> 4049.359
but the problem is if i build a lot of

4048.72 --> 4051.68
muscles

4049.359 --> 4053.92
i get certain type of problems with them

4051.68 --> 4056.8799999999997
i always had

4053.92 --> 4058.0
get issues with my back it's very

4056.88 --> 4060.559
annoying

4058.0 --> 4062.24
so this is just kind of the ideal form

4060.559 --> 4065.92
and i do keep in shape you know

4062.24 --> 4067.4399999999996
sort of but just in a minor way i don't

4065.92 --> 4069.2000000000003
really want to have like these huge

4067.44 --> 4072.079
muscles or anything i don't need them

4069.2 --> 4072.0789999999997
i have quickness

4073.92 --> 4079.119
and yeah my what do you call it

4082.16 --> 4087.7599999999998
ligaments what yeah

4085.839 --> 4089.7599999999998
the turning party the body i can't find

4087.76 --> 4091.44
the word for it but yeah those are

4089.76 --> 4093.76
working great

4091.44 --> 4097.68
so if i'm then gonna build muscle it's

4093.76 --> 4097.68
gonna like rearrange it all again

4098.799 --> 4103.44
i think i'm fine how i am and the only

4101.839 --> 4119.839
one that could probably change my mind

4103.44 --> 4119.839
about that would be a girlfriend so

4122.159 --> 4126.239
it will help me why would i

4127.44 --> 4133.839
what is your fascination with this bow

4129.52 --> 4133.839000000001
constantly it's just a bow

4134.799 --> 4139.199
it's not even a really special one well

4136.88 --> 4143.12
i think it's special because it's

4139.199 --> 4143.12
not a modern bow

4143.6 --> 4147.92
although i think it does have like glass

4145.759 --> 4149.92
fiber parts but it's just glass fiber

4147.92 --> 4151.839
and wood i think

4149.92 --> 4154.2390000000005
there's no real plastic on there so it's

4151.839 --> 4156.239
not really like a sports bow or anything

4154.239 --> 4160.0
it wasn't even that expensive it's

4156.239 --> 4174.4
just a bow it works that's good enough

4160.0 --> 4189.839
for me

4174.4 --> 4189.839
stop come on stop it you two

4200.84 --> 4203.84
so

4207.92 --> 4217.84
is that happy yeah well not always but

4220.88 --> 4225.28
usually when he gets very active he yeah

4226.88 --> 4231.28
ah come on stop a traffic get mrs that

4229.679 --> 4232.88
you know that's not the right word it's

4231.28 --> 4245.84
called a scaredy cat

4232.88 --> 4245.84
these days

4247.1 --> 4250.35
[Music]

4254.96 --> 4260.0
you want to more know about the quiver

4257.12 --> 4263.84
it has arrows in it

4260.0 --> 4266.56
yeah with actual pointy steel

4263.84 --> 4266.56
thingy so

4267.12 --> 4273.84
yeah they're real arrows

4275.36 --> 4279.36
like they shoot into trees

4284.84 --> 4287.84
so

4294.64 --> 4301.84
anyway yeah good night vegan bear

4305.04 --> 4307.92
bear arms

4309.04 --> 4315.28
armor piecing air what

4312.239 --> 4317.678999999999
no and i don't have any explosive arrows

4315.28 --> 4317.679
either

4319.76 --> 4332.400000000001
i'm not rambo

4329.76 --> 4332.400000000001
but yeah

4332.8 --> 4335.84
you know it's

4337.36 --> 4342.159
it can potentially be an effective

4340.84 --> 4344.88
deterrent

4342.159 --> 4346.719
but yeah i wasn't planning on assaulting

4344.88 --> 4348.400000000001
any government or anything with that

4346.719 --> 4352.4
it's ridiculous

4348.4 --> 4354.48
no not doing that at all

4352.4 --> 4355.44
that's not what it's for but like if

4354.48 --> 4359.28
there's just some

4355.44 --> 4361.28
bunch of [ __ ] thugs or anything yeah

4359.28 --> 4362.4
they don't like getting hurt with an

4361.28 --> 4365.679
arrow

4362.4 --> 4368.159
so it's a potential deterrent you know

4365.679 --> 4368.159
that's it

4369.8 --> 4378.0
incendiary arrows what the

4372.96 --> 4380.88
now dude only in my dnd book

4378.0 --> 4382.48
i have actually designed for designed

4380.88 --> 4385.6
virtually designed

4382.48 --> 4389.199
in dnd a lot of different types of

4385.6 --> 4389.1990000000005
arrows that do all kinds of things

4392.96 --> 4399.84
special arrows

4410.84 --> 4415.76
uh

4413.84 --> 4419.12
in the original zelda game you could

4415.76 --> 4419.12
shoot bomb arrows

4419.76 --> 4422.159000000001
okay

4424.719 --> 4427.84
i did not know that

4440.48 --> 4445.44
what the [ __ ] what kind of a question is

4444.239 --> 4447.919999999999
that

4445.44 --> 4448.799999999999
are you like trying to dig for dirt on

4447.92 --> 4450.88
me

4448.8 --> 4455.84
at three stop motion because this is

4450.88 --> 4455.84
really starting to sound like that

4460.64 --> 4464.88
like what the [ __ ] you want to know

4462.48 --> 4464.879999999999
about

4468.719 --> 4475.6
but seriously no

4471.92 --> 4475.6
no i've never paid anyone

4475.92 --> 4482.64
for sex this is i have

4479.199 --> 4486.239
paid for

4482.64 --> 4486.2390000000005
having girlfriends

4486.4 --> 4490.639999999999
in the sense that yeah but that's not

4489.04 --> 4491.6
something you pay up front that's

4490.64 --> 4495.1990000000005
something you pay

4491.6 --> 4497.4400000000005
afterwards with a broken heart

4495.199 --> 4499.28
and realizing how stupid you've been

4497.44 --> 4503.28
trusting them and [ __ ]

4499.28 --> 4503.28
but yeah

4504.96 --> 4511.199
yeah that's too bad because you can rest

4508.84 --> 4513.84
ahead

4511.199 --> 4516.159
known for their red light districts oh

4513.84 --> 4516.159000000001
really

4516.64 --> 4519.4400000000005
okey dokey

4520.56 --> 4525.84
did yeah you know

4528.4 --> 4532.32
i think it's probably more known

4534.239 --> 4541.28
okay f3 stop motion stop

4538.32 --> 4541.759999999999
stop biting and stop calling him a beta

4541.28 --> 4544.48
that's

4541.76 --> 4547.84
really [ __ ] dumb you don't even know

4544.48 --> 4547.839999999999
what a [ __ ] beta is

4548.56 --> 4552.080000000001
you know that that vernacular you pick

4550.719 --> 4557.52
that up

4552.08 --> 4557.5199999999995
from a very very old tear

4558.0 --> 4562.8
like that it's really stupid to call

4562.32 --> 4566.0
somebody

4562.8 --> 4570.0
beta you know that actual

4566.0 --> 4570.0
betas are pretty awesome people

4574.8 --> 4577.92
yeah rasta had knows that that's why

4576.96 --> 4582.2390000000005
he's calling you

4577.92 --> 4582.2390000000005
a gamma because that is the real thing

4584.719 --> 4589.65
betas are not like that at all but you

4587.76 --> 4592.729
probably would know

4589.65 --> 4592.728999999999
[Music]

4593.28 --> 4596.639999999999
i'm not talking about who's starting

4595.28 --> 4600.08
insults here i'm just

4596.64 --> 4608.96
addressing your vernacular

4600.08 --> 4611.12
seems very outdated

4608.96 --> 4613.44
you don't even realize that technically

4611.12 --> 4616.88
calling somebody a beta

4613.44 --> 4616.879999999999
is not even an insult

4617.04 --> 4623.84
on average if you tell somebody that

4620.719 --> 4624.96
that's actually a compliment because the

4623.84 --> 4628.0
vast majority is

4624.96 --> 4631.52
gammas this is well not the fast

4628.0 --> 4634.239
a lot of them so data is really not

4631.52 --> 4636.0
bad betas are awesome people betas are

4634.239 --> 4639.599999999999
great assistants

4636.0 --> 4641.36
i am kind of beta type in my own ways

4639.6 --> 4643.4400000000005
but yeah i got all kinds of things i'm

4641.36 --> 4647.199
also very contra opposite

4643.44 --> 4647.199
betas usually are not that much

4647.52 --> 4651.52
the betas are basically just one step

4649.36 --> 4654.639999999999
away from an alpha

4651.52 --> 4656.400000000001
but they're more flexible owen benjamin

4654.64 --> 4658.320000000001
explained this many times

4656.4 --> 4659.92
how that works but that's that's a while

4658.32 --> 4664.719
ago now like a year ago

4659.92 --> 4668.08
i guess beta is a [ __ ]

4664.719 --> 4669.199
really why tell no no nobody touched

4668.08 --> 4671.199
this guy

4669.199 --> 4672.4
and i want you to go into conversation

4671.199 --> 4676.32
with me about this so

4672.4 --> 4679.44
tell me why a beta

4676.32 --> 4684.239
is a [ __ ] in your opinion

4679.44 --> 4684.239
why why can you explain that

4686.96 --> 4690.8
do you understand the words that you're

4690.84 --> 4693.84
using

4694.32 --> 4706.88
aufus have zero intellect no that's not

4696.8 --> 4710.08
necessarily true

4706.88 --> 4714.32
the guys well that's fine

4710.08 --> 4721.04
but that's not a beta just so you know

4714.32 --> 4723.28
that's a gamma

4721.04 --> 4726.0
funnily enough i think that you might

4723.28 --> 4730.08
actually be more of a beta

4726.0 --> 4730.08
but you're kind of fresh you're kind of

4732.84 --> 4735.84
green

4743.76 --> 4753.280000000001
i punch an alpha in his bird chest what

4749.199 --> 4753.28
what does that even mean good servant

4760.4 --> 4763.44
yeah one big pond you you got a point

4763.04 --> 4765.28
but

4763.44 --> 4767.5199999999995
i'm just trying to sit this out

4765.28 --> 4770.48
otherwise it's

4767.52 --> 4774.320000000001
gonna make a mess i don't want f3 stop

4770.48 --> 4777.44
motion to basically permanently go away

4774.32 --> 4781.44
but he's being kind of reckless so

4777.44 --> 4783.759999999999
i'm just preventing that from happening

4781.44 --> 4786.639999999999
that's why i'm kind of yeah addressing

4783.76 --> 4786.64
this sorry

4788.08 --> 4791.76
the beta male is an unremarkable

4790.64 --> 4796.0
mediocre

4791.76 --> 4796.0
careful man voice fresh concoction

4796.48 --> 4809.759999999999
beta meal what

4805.76 --> 4813.12
no i i don't know where you're

4809.76 --> 4819.84
getting that where did you derive

4813.12 --> 4819.84
that description from george sanford

4825.44 --> 4830.799999999999
because that's drawn way out of

4828.4 --> 4834.879999999999
proportion that's like a

4830.8 --> 4834.88
beta male in a terrible position

4835.84 --> 4839.84
look a beta male is basically a beta

4838.0 --> 4840.719
male because they're not an alpha male

4839.84 --> 4844.56
they're just

4840.719 --> 4849.12
like half an alpha male but they

4844.56 --> 4851.6
they do lack some natural confidence

4849.12 --> 4852.5599999999995
but they don't lack it entirely at all

4851.6 --> 4855.76
they just

4852.56 --> 4857.76
lend confidence from others from being

4855.76 --> 4861.76
with others they

4857.76 --> 4864.2390000000005
they yeah they they don't do great on

4861.76 --> 4864.2390000000005
their own

4869.44 --> 4875.839999999999
beta doesn't where did you copy it from

4882.88 --> 4887.1990000000005
guys can you please tell me urban

4885.679 --> 4889.76
dictionary what

4887.199 --> 4891.36
oh god yeah right well urban dictionary

4889.76 --> 4895.6
well sorry i don't really talk

4891.36 --> 4895.599999999999
urban if you know what i mean

4900.96 --> 4905.199
yeah i think that's kind of outdated

4912.08 --> 4918.8
all right okay we get what you meant we

4915.84 --> 4921.32
understand what your intention was when

4918.8 --> 4924.56
you use that word don't worry we're not

4921.32 --> 4928.0
misunderstanding what you meant

4924.56 --> 4931.280000000001
i'm just disagreeing with

4928.0 --> 4932.8
that vernacular use of the word that's

4931.28 --> 4934.8
all

4932.8 --> 4936.08
because there's a much more constructive

4934.8 --> 4945.84
way to get

4936.08 --> 4945.84
yeah with the archetypes

4947.92 --> 4951.28
yeah here we go again i know i know they

4950.4 --> 4954.0
do

4951.28 --> 4955.28
they still hang on to that but it's kind

4954.0 --> 4956.96
of old

4955.28 --> 4958.4
there's just better ways to define it

4956.96 --> 4961.6
it's not a beta it's a gamma they're

4958.4 --> 4961.599999999999
talking about gammas

4964.0 --> 4969.28
and technically it's a sliding scale and

4967.12 --> 4971.84
it's like alpha is the exact counter

4969.28 --> 4975.199
opposite of a gamma

4971.84 --> 4978.719
the beta is slightly in between more

4975.199 --> 4982.5599999999995
next to the alpha but they yeah a person

4978.719 --> 4985.679
in their lifetime can slide down

4982.56 --> 4990.56
or rise up between

4985.679 --> 4990.56
these kind of frequency positions

4990.719 --> 4994.08
so it's much more purposeful instead of

4993.6 --> 4997.120000000001
just

4994.08 --> 5001.04
taking a word and then using it as a

4997.12 --> 5003.76
as a scapegoat bet it's just a beta just

5001.04 --> 5006.159
oh beta is bad beta bad bait to bad

5003.76 --> 5008.159000000001
i don't know i'd like to actually get

5006.159 --> 5009.12
into character types with this like what

5008.159 --> 5011.44
is actually

5009.12 --> 5013.04
the issue how are they why are they like

5011.44 --> 5015.199
that

5013.04 --> 5016.4
what are the different types of ways to

5015.199 --> 5028.96
be

5016.4 --> 5043.839999999999
and there's a lot of types

5028.96 --> 5043.84
[ __ ] sake stupid kids

5051.36 --> 5056.88
did you work on your written why no

5054.639 --> 5059.679
there's i've already pretty much done

5056.88 --> 5061.92
almost everything i can conceive of

5059.679 --> 5063.76
with the rectangular looping models at

5061.92 --> 5067.4400000000005
happy

5063.76 --> 5068.56
i literally today gave a roll out

5067.44 --> 5071.5199999999995
example again

5068.56 --> 5073.6
of how to falsify it and what would

5071.52 --> 5076.8
happen every step of the way

5073.6 --> 5080.639
because i can be wrong

5076.8 --> 5084.719
so yeah i addressed that today

5080.639 --> 5087.84
if you missed it then re-watch the show

5084.719 --> 5087.84
it's a good show today

5095.6 --> 5099.6
i don't know is that tappy because

5097.12 --> 5102.239
sometimes you you are kind of like

5099.6 --> 5104.08
frolicky and silly so i i i don't know

5102.239 --> 5107.599999999999
it's just force a habit

5104.08 --> 5110.159
it's frequency association i think you

5107.6 --> 5111.679
probably do have a bit of a silly voice

5110.159 --> 5113.199
and if not

5111.679 --> 5116.159
i think you're a little bit of a silly

5113.199 --> 5118.5599999999995
person sometimes so that's why

5116.159 --> 5120.239
it's automatic i don't i don't plan to

5118.56 --> 5127.84
do this

5120.239 --> 5127.839999999999
i'm serious it's just association

5132.639 --> 5136.2390000000005
the [ __ ] here you goes again

5136.639 --> 5141.84
it's none of your damn business dude

5152.08 --> 5156.639
yeah what you think i'm i'm gonna tell

5154.0 --> 5157.84
you about the nuclear bomb in my

5156.639 --> 5159.679
basement

5157.84 --> 5162.2390000000005
or something like what the [ __ ] is your

5159.679 --> 5162.2390000000005
point here

5164.4 --> 5167.759999999999
you think if i got something illegal or

5167.04 --> 5171.28
anything

5167.76 --> 5171.280000000001
i'm just gonna say it

5171.6 --> 5176.88
like that's what are you an

5174.719 --> 5178.639
ex-cop or something they they do that

5176.88 --> 5180.639
[ __ ] just ask you

5178.639 --> 5182.719
do you have anything illegal you want to

5180.639 --> 5185.679
report really

5182.719 --> 5186.32
what the [ __ ] is the point here dude

5185.679 --> 5188.08
like

5186.32 --> 5189.679
yeah i've had been very patient but

5188.08 --> 5190.08
you're getting on my nerves now here

5189.679 --> 5196.4800000000005
it's

5190.08 --> 5211.84
very annoying

5196.48 --> 5211.839999999999
why do you want to know

5215.36 --> 5225.839999999999
why are you asking me about weapons

5228.32 --> 5233.599999999999
where is the associate why why would you

5231.36 --> 5238.48
go to my channel and ask me about

5233.6 --> 5240.4800000000005
weapons what the [ __ ] is this yes i do

5238.48 --> 5242.799999999999
need more money send me to my paypal

5240.48 --> 5242.799999999999
please

5244.639 --> 5253.84
but you're right i definitely do need

5246.719 --> 5253.84
more money

5256.719 --> 5267.84
stop i dressed ahead

5268.65 --> 5271.799999999999
[Music]

5283.36 --> 5287.679
[Music]

5285.36 --> 5295.839999999999
jesus [ __ ] these kids like a lot of

5287.679 --> 5298.88
explosives out there

5295.84 --> 5309.84
yes f-tappy why do you think that is

5298.88 --> 5309.84
why do you think that is

5315.12 --> 5320.639
yeah because there's a lot of people out

5317.679 --> 5324.0
there that don't like flat earthers

5320.639 --> 5327.679
that or that have fears

5324.0 --> 5330.48
that flat earth movement will

5327.679 --> 5333.76
i don't know risk their business

5330.48 --> 5336.239
investment or something

5333.76 --> 5336.8
so yeah they are there are people out

5336.239 --> 5339.919999999999
there

5336.8 --> 5342.159000000001
i guarantee i'm not saying it's you

5339.92 --> 5344.639
but just in general there are people

5342.159 --> 5347.04
that are scouring

5344.639 --> 5348.400000000001
for information for blackmail

5347.04 --> 5351.679
information they always do

5348.4 --> 5354.159
especially in open communication places

5351.679 --> 5354.159
they do

5354.719 --> 5357.84
and i'm not saying that this guy is

5357.12 --> 5359.92
doing that

5357.84 --> 5361.360000000001
but every time somebody brings that up

5359.92 --> 5363.92
yeah that's what i'm gonna say

5361.36 --> 5365.599999999999
yeah it's fireworks a free stop-motion

5363.92 --> 5369.52
this is the netherlands

5365.6 --> 5372.88
so yeah every year the last few months

5369.52 --> 5375.1990000000005
it's a war zone and in the last

5372.88 --> 5376.96
in the last week it's an absolute war

5375.199 --> 5378.638999999999
zone constantly

5376.96 --> 5380.0
and then after the new year it stops

5378.639 --> 5381.84
again

5380.0 --> 5383.28
because yeah we're the netherlands and

5381.84 --> 5386.8
we're explosives

5383.28 --> 5390.159
enthusiasts we blow [ __ ] up

5386.8 --> 5391.92
little kids get explosives

5390.159 --> 5393.599999999999
legally and they walk the streets and

5391.92 --> 5395.04
just blow [ __ ] up even though they're

5393.6 --> 5398.88
not even supposed to do it

5395.04 --> 5399.44
except for the last like the last three

5398.88 --> 5402.639
days or

5399.44 --> 5404.32
it's legal to do that but little kids

5402.639 --> 5407.36
just walk around

5404.32 --> 5410.32
three months in advance with super heavy

5407.36 --> 5413.44
explosives on the streets

5410.32 --> 5415.84
anyway because

5413.44 --> 5417.678999999999
nobody's doing [ __ ] about it i guess

5415.84 --> 5418.159000000001
police doesn't even come by for that

5417.679 --> 5419.84
[ __ ]

5418.159 --> 5421.5199999999995
sometimes it really pisses me off

5419.84 --> 5423.360000000001
because i don't mind if they

5421.52 --> 5425.360000000001
play around with stupid firecrackers

5423.36 --> 5425.839999999999
even little loud firecrackers but these

5425.36 --> 5429.199
are like

5425.84 --> 5431.52
freaking detonation

5429.199 --> 5432.5599999999995
type explosives and they're very

5431.52 --> 5435.040000000001
disruptive

5432.56 --> 5437.280000000001
they're very disruptive to nature like

5435.04 --> 5439.36
the animals are really having a bad time

5437.28 --> 5442.639
because of that [ __ ]

5439.36 --> 5444.08
you know a little expl like just gaseous

5442.639 --> 5447.36
explosions

5444.08 --> 5448.96
are not as disruptive as detonations

5447.36 --> 5451.599999999999
because they are like shock waves and

5448.96 --> 5455.28
they you can't shield yourself from that

5451.6 --> 5455.280000000001
it's very disruptive to animals

5461.12 --> 5465.04
even though i do love like fireworks

5463.44 --> 5467.199
[ __ ] i i wish they really

5465.04 --> 5470.08
just didn't do it all the time with the

5467.199 --> 5473.12
hard explosives

5470.08 --> 5473.679
you know in the last three days sure go

5473.12 --> 5476.0
ahead

5473.679 --> 5478.32
make it a war zone the all the birds

5476.0 --> 5481.52
have flown away by that time anyway

5478.32 --> 5483.199
they do and then yeah it's like the

5481.52 --> 5486.56
three days of hells for

5483.199 --> 5488.239
hell for a lot of cats and dogs usually

5486.56 --> 5489.1990000000005
[ __ ] on the carpet inside and all

5488.239 --> 5493.199
that

5489.199 --> 5497.28
during that time but yeah it's

5493.199 --> 5500.4
it it can't be like hard explosives

5497.28 --> 5502.719
throughout like an entire season

5500.4 --> 5503.599999999999
i i really think they do should stop

5502.719 --> 5505.84
that

5503.6 --> 5508.56
that police should go after the hard

5505.84 --> 5508.56
explosives

5510.4 --> 5513.839999999999
not saying this should be illegal it

5511.92 --> 5515.04
should they should just go off them

5513.84 --> 5518.8
because they're very

5515.04 --> 5521.04
disruptive you know fine

5518.8 --> 5523.4400000000005
bang bang bang yeah yeah you can hear

5521.04 --> 5526.0
that it'll distract you it will not

5523.44 --> 5526.5599999999995
cause a shockwave that is going to like

5526.0 --> 5528.719
give

5526.56 --> 5529.679
little animals heart attacks for three

5528.719 --> 5533.84
months straight

5529.679 --> 5533.84
you know

5534.48 --> 5539.44
