there isn't any like fluffy clouds

153.36 --> 157.84

trail haze

161.68 --> 164.08
up there

164.48 --> 169.67999999999998

sun all that much

169.68 --> 173.12
oh yeah also

171.12 --> 174.64000000000001
noticeable is that there's almost no

173.12 --> 177.519
wind and that's probably why it's so

174.64 --> 177.51899999999998
incredibly hot

so

181.84 --> 187.84

299.68 --> 304.72
so that helps

302.56 --> 307.36
but

304.72 --> 309.759
yeah basically i started to show like 10

307.36 --> 311.36
15 minutes late because i was having a

309.759 --> 313.199
siesta

311.36 --> 315.68
for like 30 minutes

313.199 --> 317.44
downstairs on the couch where it's a

315.68 --> 321.28000000000003
little cooler

317.44 --> 321.28
that did feel like great though

323.36 --> 328.24
i'm glad i did that

326.0 --> 329.6
otherwise i might be having some issues

328.24 --> 332.479
like

329.6 --> 335.96000000000004
again so just did that

332.479 --> 335.96

343.84 --> 347.35999999999996
john quantum eraser was complaining

346.16 --> 349.36
about

347.36 --> 352.88
like everything just burning to death

349.36 --> 356.08000000000004

352.88 --> 356.08
heat wave zone

360.479 --> 364.84

362.96 --> 368.08

364.84 --> 371.61999999999995

368.08 --> 373.59999999999997
used to the sun constantly scorching him

371.62 --> 376.08
[Music]

373.6 --> 378.639
the white doves here are like constantly

376.08 --> 381.33

396.639 --> 399.84000000000003

402.96 --> 407.59999999999997
putting water outside like six or seven

406.479 --> 410.919
times

is it over what do you mean

735.68 --> 740.079
okay elise g that that is funny

740.24 --> 747.24
especially that the cat like gets along

742.56 --> 747.2399999999999
with your dog as well it's hilarious

755.55 --> 758.7099999999999
[Music]

759.519 --> 764.32
yeah

761.36 --> 764.32
yeah that's how like

765.36 --> 769.6800000000001
the mother of my cat that i had like 14

767.92 --> 772.959
years

769.68 --> 775.76
they she was a stray cat too that like

772.959 --> 777.92
ate bread we left out for the birds in

775.76 --> 780.0
at winter

777.92 --> 781.76
like she was eating the bread and we

780.0 --> 786.24
were like holy [ __ ]

781.76 --> 788.56
that's like a really cute cat

786.24 --> 790.72
she's looks starved so we kind of

788.56 --> 791.5999999999999
adopted her and like

790.72 --> 793.0400000000001
like

791.6 --> 795.76
yeah

793.04 --> 798.0
it's amazing amazing experience amazing

795.76 --> 798.0
cat

799.279 --> 803.76
right

800.72 --> 803.76
and straight cats

804.0 --> 810.32
usually have pretty good genes

807.2 --> 814.1600000000001
sounds weird right because they can

810.32 --> 817.1600000000001
survive on instinct in the wild

814.16 --> 817.16
right

828.399 --> 832.16
anyway that's that's nice at least g

832.88 --> 838.279
ah a flatter sage good see you

852.56 --> 858.8399999999999
to see the other side of cat lifestyle

855.76 --> 861.9399999999999
that's hilarious matthew hall

858.84 --> 861.94
[Music]

867.76 --> 873.12
never considered yourself a cat person

870.32 --> 874.72
right until you meet the right cat

873.12 --> 876.5600000000001
and i'm the same there's a lot of

874.72 --> 878.24
different cats out there that you might

876.56 --> 880.7199999999999
bump into like in the days when i was

878.24 --> 881.44
still doing paper routes

880.72 --> 884.0
and

881.44 --> 885.44
made me realize how many cats are just

884.0 --> 887.199
kind of annoying

885.44 --> 889.1990000000001
they're just like

887.199 --> 890.16
skinny and

889.199 --> 891.76
like

890.16 --> 894.56
have just

891.76 --> 897.76
unbalanced characters right

894.56 --> 900.2399999999999
but there are some cats that are like

897.76 --> 903.519
brilliant compared to others

900.24 --> 907.12
and that are like really smart and like

903.519 --> 910.079
almost telepathic and all that

907.12 --> 913.519
and yeah those are the cats those are

910.079 --> 916.959
amazing i love those

913.519 --> 916.9590000000001
the special ones in between

917.279 --> 922.16
but yeah i agree most a lot of cats are

919.68 --> 923.68
just annoying they're just like scaredy

922.16 --> 926.079
cats or

923.68 --> 927.8389999999999
they're always in a bad mood or they're

926.079 --> 930.959
just super

927.839 --> 930.9590000000001
super arrogant

931.44 --> 933.759
this is

934.88 --> 941.399
hmm

936.56 --> 941.399
so i don't like every cat either

945.68 --> 951.0
ah yeah pjc [ __ ] you told me yesterday

947.839 --> 951.0
as well

962.399 --> 966.32
yeah that's what they do that's how they

964.56 --> 969.7199999999999
claim ya

966.32 --> 969.72
really she

973.36 --> 976.9590000000001
yeah and if you have like a connection

975.04 --> 979.04
with a cat like that they'll they'll be

976.959 --> 981.5189999999999
doing that and they have their they are

979.04 --> 984.3199999999999
like energy transformers

981.519 --> 986.5600000000001
like they literally are that they can

984.32 --> 988.0
a cat that like instinctually wants to

986.56 --> 988.88
sit on your lap

988.0 --> 990.399
like

988.88 --> 993.199
sounds weird

990.399 --> 997.16
but like they can take away

993.199 --> 997.16
your disease even

998.48 --> 1003.839
like if you have something that's like

1000.399 --> 1003.839
coming in through the spirit

1003.92 --> 1008.4799999999999
there's some yeah they can literally

1006.16 --> 1011.759
just take that away

1008.48 --> 1013.6800000000001
make you bypass on it entirely

1011.759 --> 1016.5600000000001
so yeah cats are

1013.68 --> 1016.56
therapeutical

1018.16 --> 1021.8389999999999
some

1020.16 --> 1023.6
when they do that

1021.839 --> 1025.52
you can't just like pick up a cat and

1023.6 --> 1028.0
put it on your lap and make it do that

1025.52 --> 1029.52
like it will have to like do that by

1028.0 --> 1033.679
itself

1029.52 --> 1033.679
and then it like does miracles

1036.16 --> 1039.8390000000002
germline's what

1044.4 --> 1049.76
and oh by the way

1046.72 --> 1051.52
there are dogs that do that too

1049.76 --> 1053.679
maybe they're not gonna sit on your lap

1051.52 --> 1054.559
but they effectively do it they're like

1053.679 --> 1056.96
more

1054.559 --> 1059.6789999999999
they put your head in your

1056.96 --> 1061.8400000000001
on your leg that sort of thing

1059.679 --> 1064.5590000000002
that's kind of the same effect

1061.84 --> 1067.84
as what cats do except cats just go and

1064.559 --> 1067.84
sit on your lap

1089.84 --> 1093.36
oh

1091.679 --> 1094.96
wow

1093.36 --> 1097.52
wait what

1094.96 --> 1101.679
frequency range of cat purring that

1097.52 --> 1103.679
promotes bone density development that

1101.679 --> 1105.8400000000001
that is just surreal

1103.679 --> 1109.16
i didn't know that matthew where are you

1105.84 --> 1109.1599999999999
getting that

1110.4 --> 1113.2800000000002
that's amazing

1116.48 --> 1122.0
can't see the spirit world

1118.72 --> 1125.1200000000001
yeah but so do dogs

1122.0 --> 1125.12
nathan queering

1126.799 --> 1131.84
right and some cats are like

1129.28 --> 1134.3999999999999
almost demon possessed

1131.84 --> 1136.9599999999998
and some dogs are just

1134.4 --> 1139.44
well they're like too distracted so in

1136.96 --> 1141.8400000000001
that sense they're just like humans cats

1139.44 --> 1144.0800000000002
and dogs

1141.84 --> 1144.08
right

1144.88 --> 1149.0390000000002
except that cats and dogs are just not

1147.2 --> 1151.1200000000001
distracted by

1149.039 --> 1153.76
human

1151.12 --> 1153.76
ideas

1153.84 --> 1160.24
that's the big difference

1155.919 --> 1162.5590000000002
so if they have focus or care to see

1160.24 --> 1164.48
then they will see it

1162.559 --> 1166.559
dogs and cats

1164.48 --> 1169.6
where humans will have much greater

1166.559 --> 1172.16
chance to have like entire routines

1169.6 --> 1173.28
built to distract themselves from seeing

1172.16 --> 1176.28
such things

1173.28 --> 1176.28
serious

1180.799 --> 1185.039
okay

1182.24 --> 1187.36
dr karen

1185.039 --> 1187.36
hmm

1189.84 --> 1195.1999999999998
okay well it might be a bit of a weird

1192.72 --> 1197.76
rumor then i'd have to like look that up

1195.2 --> 1199.76
if that's actually true interesting

1197.76 --> 1204.6
but even if it weren't true then it's

1199.76 --> 1204.6
still therapeutical anyway so

1212.159 --> 1218.5590000000002
but like i mean

1214.4 --> 1221.52
did the guy do medical research

1218.559 --> 1223.36
like with test groups and some would

1221.52 --> 1225.76
just like have

1223.36 --> 1228.1589999999999
cats on their laps

1225.76 --> 1231.039
every day for like

1228.159 --> 1233.2
an hour or something for a year time and

1231.039 --> 1235.52
the other group want and then check that

1233.2 --> 1237.2
bone dance is that did he actually do

1235.52 --> 1239.76
such research

1237.2 --> 1243.28
that is hilarious it is not difficult to

1239.76 --> 1244.96
do such research i can imagine

1243.28 --> 1247.52
it's really funny

1244.96 --> 1251.8400000000001
like how would he even

1247.52 --> 1254.08
come to the idea that that's the case

1251.84 --> 1255.76
that's the more weird part like how

1254.08 --> 1258.32
where did he get the idea that that

1255.76 --> 1260.08
actually works

1258.32 --> 1262.24
right you have to have an idea of what's

1260.08 --> 1264.24
going on before you even come up with

1262.24 --> 1267.52
like scientific

1264.24 --> 1267.52
test groups and all that

1271.12 --> 1274.1589999999999
oh

1271.919 --> 1274.159
okay

1274.72 --> 1278.159
oh

1276.88 --> 1281.5200000000002
oh that's

1278.159 --> 1282.72
yeah those are the best that's

1281.52 --> 1284.6399999999999
like

1282.72 --> 1290.0
mother of my cat

1284.64 --> 1292.5590000000002
was like that too it's like a apache

1290.0 --> 1292.559

1300.72 --> 1304.28
i'll share it

1305.919 --> 1309.3200000000002
if that's okay

1321.99 --> 1328.069
[Music]

1329.84 --> 1332.84

hmm

1447.2 --> 1451.6000000000001
well i got the impression to she matthew

1449.84 --> 1454.08
hall

1451.6 --> 1454.08
typical

1454.32 --> 1457.799
female cat

1465.12 --> 1469.76
ah calico oh it's a breed

1468.559 --> 1472.72
all right

1469.76 --> 1474.8799999999999
it's always a female is it

1472.72 --> 1478.2
why is that

1474.88 --> 1478.2
that's weird

1485.11 --> 1490.1899999999998
[Music]

1508.96 --> 1512.96
this is hilarious but

1511.12 --> 1516.32
a calico cat

1512.96 --> 1520.559
that has cream and gray patches

1516.32 --> 1523.559
is called a muted calico

1520.559 --> 1523.559
beauty

1531.12 --> 1534.9189999999999
serious look it up

1549.36 --> 1555.24
cat one blue

1552.24 --> 1555.24
hmm

1560.96 --> 1563.3600000000001
okay

1563.44 --> 1569.96
if you're comfortable with giving that

1565.44 --> 1569.96
kind of a name to your cat

1570.96 --> 1575.44
that's fine it's your cat or

1574.559 --> 1576.3999999999999
your

1575.44 --> 1578.799
her

1576.4 --> 1578.799
human

1580.48 --> 1584.96
i wonder if cats actually give people

1582.96 --> 1587.52
names

1584.96 --> 1587.52
in their head

1592.559 --> 1598.1589999999999
like has anybody ever like

1594.96 --> 1601.2
noticed that cats do kind of like can

1598.159 --> 1602.88
when they do like special meows

1601.2 --> 1605.44
that

1602.88 --> 1606.96
like sometimes it's just a general meow

1605.44 --> 1608.159
and it's always the same thing but

1606.96 --> 1611.52
sometimes

1608.159 --> 1614.4
they give like weird twists to the name

1611.52 --> 1616.4
of just to the to the way they meow

1614.4 --> 1618.159
and i always thought like that's because

1616.4 --> 1622.159
they're actually

1618.159 --> 1622.159
like giving you a meow name

1623.36 --> 1628.32
where they meow in a

1625.2 --> 1630.64
in a very distinct way to like give

1628.32 --> 1634.8799999999999
recognition to that person as an

1630.64 --> 1634.88
individual anybody else ever

1634.96 --> 1638.48
picked up on anything like that

1639.84 --> 1644.08
my cat was

1641.44 --> 1646.88
very very special

1644.08 --> 1648.799
was like a hostess like my cat was the

1646.88 --> 1650.7990000000002
hostess

1648.799 --> 1653.52
she would always like come in to

1650.799 --> 1655.039
entertain new people and like be super

1653.52 --> 1657.039
super cute

1655.039 --> 1659.44
like stand on their back legs and then

1657.039 --> 1660.559

1689.36 --> 1695.1999999999998

1693.039 --> 1697.36
for the really cheeky ones that have

1695.2 --> 1699.8400000000001
moods and all that [ __ ]

1697.36 --> 1699.84
indeed

1700.799 --> 1704.48
i think that cats that really like

1703.039 --> 1706.64
people

1704.48 --> 1709.039
i don't think they basically treat us

1706.64 --> 1712.0800000000002
like that

1709.039 --> 1715.8799999999999
they think of us more than just that

1712.08 --> 1715.8799999999999
hello gary wiebenga

1749.44 --> 1752.44

1784.799 --> 1791.24
scaredy cat or sacred cat

1787.919 --> 1791.24
hello cleary

1795.12 --> 1800.399
yeah so welcome to the flat earth early

1797.039 --> 1802.799
bird show where sometimes we just talk

1800.399 --> 1805.279
about cats

1802.799 --> 1805.279
meow

1806.799 --> 1812.96
right

1809.6 --> 1814.559
i mean it's it's not always about like

1812.96 --> 1816.32
oh yeah

1814.559 --> 1818.559
oh did you know that the celestials are

1816.32 --> 1820.24
holographic and no sometimes we just

1818.559 --> 1822.399
talk about cats

1820.24 --> 1824.48
like what are cats like oh look at the

1822.399 --> 1826.4799999999998
cat right over here and cat right over

1824.48 --> 1828.559
there and

1826.48 --> 1830.64
what do you think about cats

1828.559 --> 1832.48
yeah

1830.64 --> 1837.0
it can happen all

1832.48 --> 1837.0
on the flat earth early bird show

1838.32 --> 1842.1589999999999
it's the early cat show yeah there's no

1840.399 --> 1844.799
such thing

1842.159 --> 1846.7990000000002
there's no early cats no

1844.799 --> 1848.559
cats are not early

1846.799 --> 1851.84
cats are late

1848.559 --> 1853.44
that's why they always start like

1851.84 --> 1855.6
like having sex in the middle of the

1853.44 --> 1858.48
night making all that noise

1855.6 --> 1861.12
and then i've never seen an early cat

1858.48 --> 1864.0
that's like oh i'm so early oh yes i

1861.12 --> 1867.6789999999999
want to do stuff no they're always like

1864.0 --> 1870.24
just lying around like leave me alone

1867.679 --> 1870.24
in the morning

1876.72 --> 1881.44
i mean dogs are often very early

1879.12 --> 1883.76
creatures cats are not

1881.44 --> 1886.799
maybe that's why cats

1883.76 --> 1889.2
would typically find dogs so annoying

1886.799 --> 1891.36
because cats are like

1889.2 --> 1892.72
all knackered just when the dogs are

1891.36 --> 1895.9189999999999
going to be like

1892.72 --> 1898.799
attention grabby and pokey

1895.919 --> 1900.7990000000002
i mean if i were a cat

1898.799 --> 1903.2
and there was constantly a dog trying to

1900.799 --> 1906.679
disturb my sleep i'd start to freaking

1903.2 --> 1906.679
hate them too

1908.159 --> 1912.0690000000002
right

1908.92 --> 1912.069

swan footage from what is it now 2020

1943.279 --> 1948.72
or early a long time ago

1946.72 --> 1950.88
i mean it's out there for for a long

1948.72 --> 1954.64
time if you go to quantum eraser channel

1950.88 --> 1956.96
and search on a show title black swan

1954.64 --> 1959.1200000000001
well you find a whole bunch of them if

1956.96 --> 1961.039

1961.039 --> 1965.919
presented like video footage and

1963.76 --> 1968.1589999999999
isolated images from that footage that

1965.919 --> 1971.8400000000001

1975.519 --> 1980.48

they're like like racing dogs there's no

2016.159 --> 2022.64
racing cats but there is racing dogs

2018.96 --> 2026.3990000000001
though cats can be incredibly fast

2022.64 --> 2026.3990000000001
but usually not for that long

2026.48 --> 2032.32
they're just like adrenal

2029.12 --> 2035.12
but there is like really fast long

2032.32 --> 2035.12
running dogs

2037.44 --> 2041.48
and i've been bred for that

2071.839 --> 2075.839
okay

2072.8 --> 2075.8390000000004
right back

2098.56 --> 2103.119
what are you talking about rig bag so

2100.88 --> 2106.4
you rescued two cats and they turned out

2103.119 --> 2106.4
to be a bit feral

2107.04 --> 2111.839
and like attacked you in your sleep or

2109.359 --> 2111.839
something

2113.599 --> 2118.96
i mean feral if if cats are like

2115.839 --> 2121.2799999999997
abandoned and they end up like

2118.96 --> 2122.48
fearing or hating humanity that can

2121.28 --> 2125.76
happen

2122.48 --> 2128.8
yeah they can be very

2125.76 --> 2131.8390000000004
it's like ptsd cats

2128.8 --> 2132.6400000000003
kind of dangerous

2131.839 --> 2134.0789999999997

this thing is an [ __ ] it's okay to

2152.0 --> 2158.56
what are you talking about

2155.119 --> 2161.359
that makes no logical sense in the rest

2158.56 --> 2161.359
of the sentence

2170.32 --> 2174.96
what are you talking about some dog that

2172.56 --> 2178.72

what are you talking i don't understand

2179.839 --> 2184.16
saves its life

2182.4 --> 2186.4
but it only attacks

2184.16 --> 2189.2
right so it's gone feral then it's

2186.4 --> 2189.2000000000003
traumatized

2189.839 --> 2194.72
ah yeah that's terrible it's traumatized

2267.28 --> 2271.8390000000004

2272.96 --> 2277.28
don't say things that directly

2274.96 --> 2280.0
contradict one another

2277.28 --> 2282.0

all these animals sent me like how is a

snake even gonna write a male

2407.68 --> 2411.0

2412.079 --> 2416.96
oh mold you say oh

2414.96 --> 2419.599
okay

2416.96 --> 2423.88
i did not know that yeah of course i saw

2419.599 --> 2423.88
that but it's just come on

2426.24 --> 2431.839
sometimes you just gotta go with the

2428.0 --> 2431.839
spelling error it's too funny not to

2432.24 --> 2434.56
ah

2432.96 --> 2436.839
why the hell do you even have

2434.56 --> 2439.119
autocorrect who the hell uses

2436.839 --> 2442.56
autocorrect ever

2439.119 --> 2447.0
only people that don't know how to write

2442.56 --> 2447.0
their own language use autocorrect

okay right back that's fine it's just

2544.079 --> 2549.76
oh [ __ ] you've got broken fingers okay

2547.44 --> 2553.52
well you're forgiven that

2549.76 --> 2555.92
if you get issues with spelling

2553.52 --> 2557.839
is just in general i don't like it when

2555.92 --> 2560.0
people get sloppy

2557.839 --> 2561.2
with their text especially in my chat

2560.0 --> 2563.04
because

2561.2 --> 2566.48
i that's

2563.04 --> 2569.04
like my interactions here

2566.48 --> 2572.0
so i appreciated everybody paid extra

2569.04 --> 2575.119
careful attention to what they

2572.0 --> 2578.16
write down before they press enter

2575.119 --> 2580.2400000000002
in general

2578.16 --> 2581.2799999999997
right

2580.24 --> 2584.56
it's like

2581.28 --> 2586.7200000000003
take a little extra time

2584.56 --> 2588.7999999999997
like if you're a little slower that's a

2586.72 --> 2590.839
lot less annoying than when you're

2588.8 --> 2593.119
constantly misspelling

2590.839 --> 2595.68
things especially

2593.119 --> 2599.76
if that like messes up the logical

2595.68 --> 2599.7599999999998
consistency of the sentences you say

2600.319 --> 2606.52
shut up godzilla

2601.92 --> 2606.52
i'm gonna need a paypal for that now

2625.44 --> 2629.599
what

2627.04 --> 2632.24
you mean you got like micro fractures or

2629.599 --> 2632.2400000000002
something or

2632.48 --> 2636.4
old sports injuries

2645.119 --> 2649.839
but i know what you mean like in the

2646.64 --> 2652.0789999999997
winter if it's super cold yeah i i hate

2649.839 --> 2654.56
that on my hands as well that's why i

2652.079 --> 2657.04
typically like to wear

2654.56 --> 2657.04
gloves

2658.079 --> 2660.8
in the winter

2661.28 --> 2664.3190000000004
right like these

2664.56 --> 2668.16
because

2665.52 --> 2669.7599999999998
like i tried i tried just like oh just

2668.16 --> 2674.48
do it raw

2669.76 --> 2674.48
and then my [ __ ] hands hurt like hell

2674.96 --> 2679.28
like i got

2677.04 --> 2681.7599999999998
family bones through my mother's where

2679.28 --> 2683.28
were like we cannot handle the coal very

2681.76 --> 2687.4
well

2683.28 --> 2687.4
on our feet and our hands

2691.04 --> 2694.24
there's people that like

2692.96 --> 2696.64
it just like

2694.24 --> 2699.1189999999997
ice water whatever

2696.64 --> 2702.16
they don't care

2699.119 --> 2705.44
i can handle heat incredibly like re i

2702.16 --> 2708.0789999999997
can literally pick out burning hot coals

2705.44 --> 2710.8
out of a fire with my hands i mean i'm

2708.079 --> 2712.88
not going to just grab it and shh no but

2710.8 --> 2714.19
i can literally just

2712.88 --> 2715.6800000000003
do that

2714.19 --> 2716.56
[Music]

2715.68 --> 2720.8799999999997
but

2716.56 --> 2724.92
i cannot handle excessive cold very well

2720.88 --> 2724.92
that actually does hurt

2737.92 --> 2743.56
let's

2738.8 --> 2743.5600000000004
what are you talking about lex what

2746.0 --> 2750.56
with hot things ah okay gorzilla yeah

2748.0 --> 2750.56
that's cool

2750.8 --> 2754.96
right i've always had it it was part of

2753.04 --> 2758.48
the reason why i decided to become a

2754.96 --> 2760.2400000000002
goldsmith it just seemed like yeah

2758.48 --> 2761.92
that only makes sense that i'm going to

2760.24 --> 2764.9599999999996
do that

2761.92 --> 2767.04
and by yeah my father was into it

2764.96 --> 2769.52
sort of as well

2767.04 --> 2771.04
a little here and there very i didn't

2769.52 --> 2772.72
like like his style but he was doing

2771.04 --> 2774.64
that and then i thought like i can do it

2772.72 --> 2776.0
too

2774.64 --> 2778.319
right

2776.0 --> 2780.64
and it's funny because like even

2778.319 --> 2785.119
things like burning wounds

2780.64 --> 2785.1189999999997
like heal much faster with me

2786.0 --> 2793.44
like one time i got like a terrible

2790.16 --> 2793.44
scorch on my hand

2794.079 --> 2797.8390000000004
like where it was just like totally

2796.319 --> 2800.079
white

2797.839 --> 2802.4
like like

2800.079 --> 2804.7200000000003
yeah where it is like

2802.4 --> 2808.079
almost incinerated

2804.72 --> 2810.64
it was from like a oxygen flame

2808.079 --> 2813.92
and i like just like a quarter of a

2810.64 --> 2813.92
second and it was like

2814.4 --> 2819.04
that did hurt like hell i still got like

2816.88 --> 2821.28
a weird scar

2819.04 --> 2823.839
issue on my skin from that don't if you

2821.28 --> 2823.8390000000004
can see that

2824.16 --> 2827.5989999999997
i hate the camera delay

2827.68 --> 2831.7599999999998
all

2828.839 --> 2833.7599999999998
right can you see that like

2831.76 --> 2837.0400000000004
right below the knuckle there's this

2833.76 --> 2840.1600000000003
weird sort of uneven thing

2837.04 --> 2840.16
see over here

2841.92 --> 2847.52
and that's still like because yeah

2845.599 --> 2849.6800000000003
because it got burned really bad but

2847.52 --> 2852.12
other than that like

2849.68 --> 2855.2999999999997
everything just works fine

2872.48 --> 2876.72
do i enjoy non-computer games

2877.359 --> 2882.24
sure

2878.72 --> 2882.24
i haven't done it in like

2884.0 --> 2889.68
wow

2885.28 --> 2889.6800000000003
in like over a decade though

2891.44 --> 2897.319
i used to do that all the time like with

2893.44 --> 2897.319
my family and all that

2900.319 --> 2904.48
i think i might even still have a big

2902.24 --> 2906.0
gaming game but no i think my brother

2904.48 --> 2909.559
has it

2906.0 --> 2909.559
but yeah

2914.319 --> 2918.5589999999997
i mean like

2915.92 --> 2920.64
if there's people and like i'm spending

2918.559 --> 2923.52
time with them anyway

2920.64 --> 2926.5589999999997
then i'm like yeah games why not

2923.52 --> 2927.52
like dude i used to like make board

2926.559 --> 2931.119
games

2927.52 --> 2931.119
literally i made them

2931.92 --> 2935.119
just like a hobby

2935.52 --> 2939.68
pretty elaborately too

2938.319 --> 2943.04
but

2939.68 --> 2945.2799999999997
they're all kinds like cle types oh but

2943.04 --> 2947.599
i used to like make that

2945.28 --> 2949.28
i used to actually like design them more

2947.599 --> 2950.4
than i would actually end up playing

2949.28 --> 2952.3190000000004
them

2950.4 --> 2957.2400000000002
because i just had this fascination with

2952.319 --> 2957.24
like board games and all types

2958.0 --> 2961.68
and it's it was pretty fun to like make

2960.0 --> 2963.839
them yourself

2961.68 --> 2963.839
but

2967.839 --> 2974.0
okay that it

2970.96 --> 2974.0
what does that mean

2974.16 --> 2980.7999999999997
do u p r have uh do

2978.64 --> 2982.8799999999997
speak english

nathan queering

2991.119 --> 2996.6800000000003
do you play falheim never heard of it

3020.079 --> 3023.44
hmm

3021.2 --> 3025.1189999999997
okay we just seen it so you're a chesser

3023.44 --> 3028.319
you're a chess player

3025.119 --> 3031.6800000000003
i was never super into chess

3028.319 --> 3034.88
but i do respect it it's just that

3031.68 --> 3037.68
i'm too impul i'm like too intuitive i

3034.88 --> 3038.839
every time i play that i'm like

3037.68 --> 3040.64
almost like

3038.839 --> 3042.7999999999997
yeah

3040.64 --> 3045.44
i'm gonna defy

3042.8 --> 3048.079
how people normally play chess by like

3045.44 --> 3049.359
letting my intuition do things

3048.079 --> 3052.1600000000003
that are so

3049.359 --> 3052.16
unusual

3052.319 --> 3058.5589999999997
like i'm playing to confuse the opponent

3055.599 --> 3060.6400000000003
rather than to find a winning strategy

3058.559 --> 3063.28
that's what i end up doing with chess so

3060.64 --> 3065.2
i'm just not i'm not patient enough to

3063.28 --> 3066.88
play it the right way

3065.2 --> 3069.52
i i'm not

3066.88 --> 3072.1600000000003
i never was too impatient

3069.52 --> 3072.16
for chess

3073.2 --> 3077.7599999999998
i mean if it's like really important and

3075.359 --> 3080.4
there's like weight on it then i would

3077.76 --> 3082.3190000000004
try to play it very serious but i just

3080.4 --> 3083.599
naturally i don't have the patience for

3082.319 --> 3087.599
it

3083.599 --> 3091.76
like to really dig into like oh

3087.599 --> 3094.0
so many steps ahead like i just i

3091.76 --> 3097.28
i don't get into it

3094.0 --> 3099.119
i don't wanna

3097.28 --> 3102.0
i just wanna do something that the other

3099.119 --> 3103.92
one doesn't expect

3102.0 --> 3105.52
that's what i mostly like to do with

3103.92 --> 3107.599
jess

3105.52 --> 3111.839
because it's a lot easier and you don't

3107.599 --> 3111.839
have to like break your head over that

3111.92 --> 3115.44
but yeah you're not gonna

3113.839 --> 3116.88
if you actually play against somebody

3115.44 --> 3118.64
that knows what they're doing you're not

3116.88 --> 3121.6400000000003
gonna end up winning that way

3118.64 --> 3121.64
tried

3141.119 --> 3145.0

the entirety of the energy that just

3494.319 --> 3496.64

3658.24 --> 3663.2
while i was alive in the face of the

3660.559 --> 3666.559
overwhelming amount of globe propaganda

3663.2 --> 3669.5589999999997
that i really wanted to like be part of

3666.559 --> 3669.559
too

3670.799 --> 3675.7599999999998
but effectively uh like i had the

3673.2 --> 3677.839
permanent transition

3675.76 --> 3679.76
where i basically figured out like okay

3677.839 --> 3682.799
it's like

3679.76 --> 3683.76
i can come out of the flat earth closet

3682.799 --> 3687.319
now

3683.76 --> 3687.3190000000004
and that was in 2015.

3688.079 --> 3690.88
it was scary

3697.28 --> 3702.6400000000003
all right hey casey bear by the way did

3698.799 --> 3702.64
you see me on jim bob the other day

3708.72 --> 3715.839
i i watched that part back

3711.2 --> 3715.839
and like we had a great conversation

3718.079 --> 3725.2000000000003
like that was fun listening

3720.799 --> 3725.2
uh it's like apathetic revolt that

3725.599 --> 3730.2400000000002
i show it's now two maybe three days ago

3733.119 --> 3737.88
if you don't miss that his streams okay

3738.48 --> 3741.539
[Music]

3743.2 --> 3747.839
yeah me neither unless like

3745.599 --> 3749.599
some yeah my friend from emme calls me

3747.839 --> 3752.16
up on the phone because she usually

3749.599 --> 3755.839
picks like an hour that coincides with

3752.16 --> 3755.839
when jim bob does a live stream

3755.92 --> 3761.359
she actually called me when i was on the

3758.48 --> 3761.359
show that time

3764.0 --> 3767.559
but i hung up

3790.88 --> 3797.119
like it when i jump on yeah me too but

3794.16 --> 3800.64
i have to be kind of like in the

3797.119 --> 3801.44
in still an energetic vibe to do it

3800.64 --> 3804.24
and

3801.44 --> 3806.88
sometimes i'm just kind of toasty

3804.24 --> 3809.2799999999997
around that time

3806.88 --> 3811.76
because it's basically just a few hours

3809.28 --> 3816.559
before i go to bed

3811.76 --> 3816.559
and i'm not like super energetic anymore

3817.92 --> 3821.52
so

3818.88 --> 3824.1600000000003
but when i am then i like to jump on for

3821.52 --> 3828.96
sure especially if it's a subject that

3824.16 --> 3828.96
he's treating that i can contribute to

3837.28 --> 3841.039
but yeah i really appreciate even being

3839.599 --> 3844.0
on with jim bob

3841.039 --> 3846.3190000000004
because i think he really gets me like i

3844.0 --> 3850.68
feel like he could be my brother or

3846.319 --> 3850.68
something when i'm on with him

3852.319 --> 3855.68
it's it's very different like from when

3854.64 --> 3857.68
i

3855.68 --> 3860.64
am with like the guys over at the flat

3857.68 --> 3863.68
earth debates it's very different

3860.64 --> 3866.96
so they treat me more like

3863.68 --> 3869.5989999999997
yeah like

3866.96 --> 3872.48
it's like a group a group of friends a

3869.599 --> 3875.76
gymbop is just like really like i just

3872.48 --> 3876.799
feel like wow like i like i know he gets

3875.76 --> 3880.48
me

3876.799 --> 3884.4
and that's rare that's very rare

3880.48 --> 3884.4
that i have that feeling about people

3885.28 --> 3890.079
but he's just proven it the way that he

3887.2 --> 3892.64
addresses me the way he talks me like

3890.079 --> 3894.88
like he knows my empathic nature and

3892.64 --> 3896.799
he's very careful and he does it like

3894.88 --> 3900.7200000000003
really well so

3896.799 --> 3902.64
i'm like yeah with jim bob i can just be

3900.72 --> 3905.68
like the perfect beta

3902.64 --> 3905.68
that's how it feels

3906.24 --> 3910.5589999999997
or delta however you want to see that

3911.2 --> 3915.1
i'm like yeah

3913.28 --> 3918.23
let's do this

3915.1 --> 3918.23
[Music]

3922.079 --> 3928.319
least you do it yeah casey bear but look

3926.72 --> 3932.72
i've got like

3928.319 --> 3934.88
10 000 plus hours of online on camera

3932.72 --> 3937.839
time

3934.88 --> 3937.839
you know

3939.119 --> 3945.119
trust me when i started this [ __ ]

3942.72 --> 3946.5589999999997
i like almost threw up i was that

3945.119 --> 3949.2000000000003
nervous

3946.559 --> 3952.079
like those first flatter talks i was so

3949.2 --> 3955.0389999999998
freaking nervous that like i cancelled

3952.079 --> 3957.92
doing it for a couple of times before i

3955.039 --> 3960.559
finally was like no i'm gonna do it

3957.92 --> 3963.599
because it was just so scary also

3960.559 --> 3966.2400000000002
because well flat earth was just really

3963.599 --> 3967.92
scary for me i was actually thinking i

3966.24 --> 3969.839
actually thought this that if i'm just

3967.92 --> 3971.92
gonna publicly do that and come out for

3969.839 --> 3974.48
flat earth like they're gonna come for

3971.92 --> 3976.319
me and they're gonna literally kill me

3974.48 --> 3979.52
i thought that and i had to take the

3976.319 --> 3980.96
risk anyway so it's just really scary

3979.52 --> 3983.7599999999998
back then for me

3980.96 --> 3987.2
but that's because i was like

3983.76 --> 3989.8390000000004
a whole can of vision [ __ ] from my past

3987.2 --> 3993.839
had just opened freshly after having

3989.839 --> 3993.839
been closed for like 20 years

3995.61 --> 3998.96
[Music]

3997.599 --> 4000.7200000000003
so

3998.96 --> 4001.76
good and you for conquering your fear

4000.72 --> 4003.52
yeah

4001.76 --> 4005.44
well i didn't have much choice it was

4003.52 --> 4007.839
either that or

4005.44 --> 4010.4
i lose it and then

4007.839 --> 4012.16
probably get myself killed because of

4010.4 --> 4014.079
the fear

4012.16 --> 4017.359
so

4014.079 --> 4019.76
i figured like okay i can just like

4017.359 --> 4022.0789999999997
let the fear rule over me and like hide

4019.76 --> 4024.079
in a corner and then probably have more

4022.079 --> 4025.119
chance to actually get killed because of

4024.079 --> 4028.1600000000003
the fear

4025.119 --> 4030.799
or i could just like go with it

4028.16 --> 4032.3999999999996
as other people are going with it and

4030.799 --> 4035.0389999999998
just take the risk

4032.4 --> 4037.599
right take the risk to do it take the

4035.039 --> 4038.4
risk that we might all get killed by

4037.599 --> 4040.48
some

4038.4 --> 4042.2400000000002
jesuit group or whatever

4040.48 --> 4044.16
but it turned out that wasn't the case

4042.24 --> 4048.64
no that killing

4044.16 --> 4051.5989999999997
was actually just sending merciless

4048.64 --> 4053.2
disgusting trolls after you that just

4051.599 --> 4056.4
never stop

4053.2 --> 4058.72
that was actually the real

4056.4 --> 4061.039
fear

4058.72 --> 4064.0789999999997
i thought it was like literally death

4061.039 --> 4066.079
but it wasn't it's just like people come

4064.079 --> 4068.88
after you that just start nagging you to

4066.079 --> 4071.92
death and that follow you around

4068.88 --> 4074.96
for seven years

4071.92 --> 4077.44
seven years people the same people

4074.96 --> 4079.44
comment in my comment section with the

4077.44 --> 4081.76
same crap

4079.44 --> 4083.839
seven years

4081.76 --> 4086.079
that's how long some of those trolls out

4083.839 --> 4088.72
there are doing it

4086.079 --> 4090.88
i recognize they didn't change icon they

4088.72 --> 4092.48
didn't change their tone they're exactly

4090.88 --> 4094.6400000000003
the same

4092.48 --> 4097.679
as they were seven years ago saying the

4094.64 --> 4099.199
same [ __ ] like they did seven years ago

4097.679 --> 4103.719
constantly

4099.199 --> 4103.719
like everywhere on all my videos

4104.88 --> 4108.159000000001
my groupies got

4111.44 --> 4116.839
more like basement gimps

4114.64 --> 4120.08
that they wouldn't call them groupies

4116.839 --> 4121.2789999999995
yuck bro guys anyway

4120.08 --> 4124.6
gross

4121.279 --> 4124.6
gay guys

4133.04 --> 4140.319
oh yeah elise did you hear me sing

4136.08 --> 4142.799
yesterday over at kiwis

4140.319 --> 4144.799
i was on ball busters

4142.799 --> 4146.48
and i had like a

4144.799 --> 4149.2789999999995
spurt of the moment

4146.48 --> 4149.2789999999995
inspiration

4153.12 --> 4156.44
that was hilarious

4165.6 --> 4170.400000000001
hello very tone

4167.52 --> 4172.719
yeah yeah unfortunately i can't actually

4170.4 --> 4176.48
make the bass i can't

4172.719 --> 4176.4800000000005
like i'm really disappointed that i

4176.719 --> 4182.4
that i couldn't like do it like half an

4179.6 --> 4184.56
octave lower

4182.4 --> 4186.719
i could but then some of the tones are

4184.56 --> 4187.6
literally just going to drop off

4186.719 --> 4189.44
so

4187.6 --> 4191.120000000001
i had to do it on that so yeah low

4189.44 --> 4194.5599999999995
baritone

4191.12 --> 4194.5599999999995
what i wanted to do at base

4195.15 --> 4198.299999999999
[Music]

4199.76 --> 4203.84
am i fluent in another language

4203.92 --> 4207.84
well casey bear english is my second

4206.56 --> 4211.92
language

4207.84 --> 4211.92
my first language is actually dutch

4214.4 --> 4219.12
but i don't know if you take my entire

4217.92 --> 4221.6
life

4219.12 --> 4225.04
and like put it all together like the

4221.6 --> 4227.6
amount of english i've spoken in total

4225.04 --> 4231.84
is starting to outgrow the amount of

4227.6 --> 4231.84
dutch i've spoken in total

4235.6 --> 4240.8
although

4237.92 --> 4243.12
that might still take a while

4240.8 --> 4245.04
but yeah when it comes to writing i've

4243.12 --> 4247.76
written a lot more english than i've

4245.04 --> 4249.5199999999995
written dutch

4247.76 --> 4251.92
like just

4249.52 --> 4254.8
just check out my trolls and tyrants

4251.92 --> 4259.8
book like just look at it that's all

4254.8 --> 4259.8
english all of it like a thousand pages

4260.0 --> 4263.199
you will

4261.04 --> 4266.719
will you say something in dutch now well

4263.199 --> 4266.719
what do you want me to say in dutch

4267.12 --> 4273.36
well i can say that in dutch

4269.679 --> 4275.6
though it's in it nederland sehr

4273.36 --> 4275.599999999999
no

4282.8 --> 4288.08
by the way it's really hilarious

4285.52 --> 4289.76
that if you listen to dutch and

4288.08 --> 4292.4
especially with the dutch farmers and

4289.76 --> 4294.159000000001
stuff like those dutch farmers like have

4292.4 --> 4296.0
real potty mouth

4294.159 --> 4298.96
and i love it

4296.0 --> 4301.199
they're like yeah like screw you we are

4298.96 --> 4303.6
like we just say this [ __ ] and we say it

4301.199 --> 4304.639999999999
on camera and we don't give a [ __ ]

4303.6 --> 4306.96
this is

4304.64 --> 4309.04
it's awesome but i think that like

4306.96 --> 4311.36
foreigners don't even recognize it when

4309.04 --> 4314.239
we get potty mouth

4311.36 --> 4316.96
it's amazing to just hear that that's

4314.239 --> 4316.959999999999
still out there

4319.12 --> 4323.96
smells like an hour in the wind

4331.52 --> 4337.040000000001
yeah that is extremely random bladder

4334.32 --> 4337.04
sage it is

4339.04 --> 4342.8
i don't know what what kind of opinion

4340.8 --> 4345.04
should i be having

4342.8 --> 4347.76
i mean the vikings are the vikings they

4345.04 --> 4350.32
have a certain system

4347.76 --> 4352.88
of religion and motivation it is all

4350.32 --> 4355.88
very played in on the instincts of the

4352.88 --> 4355.88
germanics

4356.0 --> 4361.52
right nordic germanics

4359.04 --> 4364.239
that culture is like

4361.52 --> 4368.96
the whole concept of valhalla

4364.239 --> 4368.959999999999
like it cannot be any more germanic

4369.04 --> 4373.36
it really like that because that where i

4372.64 --> 4375.280000000001
wa

4373.36 --> 4377.839999999999
appeals to me

4375.28 --> 4381.12
because of my germanic side

4377.84 --> 4383.360000000001
it's like when the spirit becomes like

4381.12 --> 4386.0
allows it when you allow your spirit to

4383.36 --> 4387.5199999999995
become like more than just the average

4386.0 --> 4391.92
normie

4387.52 --> 4391.92
then it valhalla starts to appeal

4392.0 --> 4396.64
so

4392.8 --> 4399.52
yeah i totally get the nordics

4396.64 --> 4401.6
and the germanics i mean the netherlands

4399.52 --> 4403.120000000001
has a germanic religion originally

4401.6 --> 4405.92
didn't you know

4403.12 --> 4409.04
like we're officially like protestant

4405.92 --> 4410.8
but the original dutch religion is a

4409.04 --> 4413.84
germanic religion

4410.8 --> 4415.6
it's almost the same as the german

4413.84 --> 4417.76
pantheon except

4415.6 --> 4419.56
the names are different so instead of

4417.76 --> 4422.649
odin we have bodan

4419.56 --> 4422.649
[Music]

4423.28 --> 4428.48
that's really fascinating because in our

4425.92 --> 4429.6
pagan religion

4428.48 --> 4432.959999999999
like

4429.6 --> 4436.8
there's literally tales of local giants

4432.96 --> 4439.52
like like with like location names in

4436.8 --> 4439.52
the country

4443.679 --> 4445.76
so

4444.88 --> 4449.28
dutch

4445.76 --> 4451.04
old religion is really amazing it's not

4449.28 --> 4453.679
super elaborate but it's really

4451.04 --> 4455.76
fascinating and almost nobody in the

4453.679 --> 4457.4400000000005
world knows about it everybody knows

4455.76 --> 4459.12
about the germanic religion and the

4457.44 --> 4461.28
norse religion nobody's heard about the

4459.12 --> 4462.719
oh that dutch yeah they had their own

4461.28 --> 4464.88
religion too

4462.719 --> 4466.8
before it kind of like got outwashed by

4464.88 --> 4469.8
the protestants and

4466.8 --> 4469.8
jews

4470.239 --> 4472.48
so

4477.6 --> 4483.56
how did viking ships communicate with

4480.239 --> 4483.5599999999995
each other

4484.239 --> 4489.959999999999
norse code

4486.08 --> 4489.96
god stevie traveler

4498.08 --> 4501.92
although

4499.679 --> 4504.159
i maybe they had like mirrors and they

4501.92 --> 4505.6
could just use the sun to kind of like

4504.159 --> 4507.199
communicate

4505.6 --> 4508.400000000001
maybe they did that

4507.199 --> 4510.159
i don't know

4508.4 --> 4512.879999999999
i mean i'm pretty sure the norse could

4510.159 --> 4514.639999999999
like make very primitive like reflective

4512.88 --> 4517.1990000000005
surfaces

4514.64 --> 4519.679
i mean if you can make

4517.199 --> 4522.32
like axes then you could potentially

4519.679 --> 4524.64
have a piece of metal polish it until it

4522.32 --> 4526.639999999999
like reflects a bit of light from the

4524.64 --> 4528.08
sun and then you could use it to like

4526.64 --> 4528.8
code

4528.08 --> 4530.5599999999995
so

4528.8 --> 4532.719
but i think i'm already taking your

4530.56 --> 4536.8
question that was actually meant as a

4532.719 --> 4539.8
joke way too serious as i do typically

4536.8 --> 4539.8
uh

4552.88 --> 4558.159000000001
dutch sayings sound really silly in

4555.76 --> 4558.159000000001
english

4562.48 --> 4566.48
well that's only because you're not

4564.239 --> 4568.5599999999995
competent enough to actually understand

4566.48 --> 4570.4
dutch

4568.56 --> 4572.88
in contrary

4570.4 --> 4576.159
almost all dutch people that have half a

4572.88 --> 4579.04
brain know how to fluently speak english

4576.159 --> 4581.679
yeah so yeah our language sounds really

4579.04 --> 4582.56
silly to you

4581.679 --> 4585.679
yeah

4582.56 --> 4585.679
because you don't get it

4587.84 --> 4593.92
i mean do you even realize that like

4591.44 --> 4595.28
an entire section of the english

4593.92 --> 4599.76
language

4595.28 --> 4602.08
is completely cornered by dutch language

4599.76 --> 4602.08
yeah

4603.679 --> 4608.719
you know where a yacht comes from where

4606.159 --> 4611.199
that word yacht comes from yeah it makes

4608.719 --> 4613.28
no sense in english does it like oh

4611.199 --> 4615.678999999999
what does that mean etymologically yeah

4613.28 --> 4615.679
comes from

4616.63 --> 4620.96
[Music]

4619.12 --> 4624.0
which is a dutch word

4620.96 --> 4624.0
or hunt

4624.88 --> 4632.8
which is what we call our ships

4629.12 --> 4634.08
typically yeah so the entire shipping

4632.8 --> 4637.52
industry

4634.08 --> 4639.76
and the words that are used are all

4637.52 --> 4643.360000000001
lent from the dutch language in the

4639.76 --> 4645.1990000000005
entirety of the english language yeah

4643.36 --> 4647.839999999999
just so you know

4645.199 --> 4649.759999999999
like you didn't just get

4647.84 --> 4652.159000000001
new york from us which was originally

4649.76 --> 4654.64
new amsterdam we also gave you your

4652.159 --> 4657.36
entire

4654.64 --> 4657.360000000001
what you call that

4659.92 --> 4664.719
yeah the entire etymological route for

4663.44 --> 4667.599999999999
shipping

4664.719 --> 4671.679
language for shipping industry language

4667.6 --> 4671.679
so that all com came from the dutch

4673.44 --> 4677.599999999999
and french a little bit of french here

4675.36 --> 4681.599999999999
and there but we have like french

4677.6 --> 4681.6
origins in the dutch language as well

4682.719 --> 4686.0
right

4683.6 --> 4688.0
it's it's really funny because i see it

4686.0 --> 4690.08
as like when all the language

4688.0 --> 4691.76
revolutions really happened when english

4690.08 --> 4694.159
was made and

4691.76 --> 4696.08
the french was modernized when all of it

4694.159 --> 4698.32
was like modernized during the

4696.08 --> 4700.8
renaissance medieval times

4698.32 --> 4703.36
the dutch were literally in the dead

4700.8 --> 4705.76
middle point of it all happening

4703.36 --> 4707.5199999999995
and so we had like influences on

4705.76 --> 4709.679
everything around us

4707.52 --> 4711.280000000001
we could like just travel abroad and

4709.679 --> 4713.679
then whoa look at what they've just

4711.28 --> 4714.88
developed we can

4713.679 --> 4717.12
use that

4714.88 --> 4719.84
we can assimilate that and then oh wow

4717.12 --> 4722.159
they they want this haha this is time to

4719.84 --> 4724.64
put our dutch stamp in there we're gonna

4722.159 --> 4726.5599999999995
like become the center of shipping

4724.64 --> 4729.4400000000005
industry

4726.56 --> 4729.4400000000005
for the world

4730.0 --> 4733.0
shapeshift

4733.86 --> 4739.28
[Music]

4736.8 --> 4741.52
it's amazing

4739.28 --> 4743.679
now the dutch were like in the middle

4741.52 --> 4746.0
like geographically in the middle of

4743.679 --> 4749.92
like all the developments like

4746.0 --> 4752.88
in between it all england france spain

4749.92 --> 4755.36
germany and that that side norway like

4752.88 --> 4757.6
just look at europe netherlands is like

4755.36 --> 4760.159
literally if you draw a circle around

4757.6 --> 4762.0
the entire continent of europe

4760.159 --> 4763.839999999999
netherlands is pretty much in the dead

4762.0 --> 4766.56
center

4763.84 --> 4769.04
so that has a lot of advantages or it

4766.56 --> 4771.84
used to have a lot of advantages because

4769.04 --> 4775.08
we were yeah at the middle ground

4771.84 --> 4775.08
for everything

4779.28 --> 4784.639999999999
we don't all use the hard g in the

4781.92 --> 4786.4800000000005
netherlands okay jarvis

4784.64 --> 4788.64
i know

4786.48 --> 4788.639999999999
but

4788.84 --> 4793.92
yeah that but that's just the southern

4791.52 --> 4795.76
part that's kind of like

4793.92 --> 4799.719
half belgium

4795.76 --> 4799.719
but they don't really count

4806.239 --> 4810.5599999999995
i mean if you can't properly pronounce

4811.84 --> 4815.1990000000005
then you're not really dutch

4815.84 --> 4819.04
yeah you could just as well be german

4817.92 --> 4821.92
then

4819.04 --> 4824.719
right belgium german

4821.92 --> 4824.719
brabants

4826.08 --> 4830.239
that's not really dutch if you can't say

4831.12 --> 4836.159
then you're not dutch

4833.04 --> 4838.88
i'm sorry yeah i know

4836.159 --> 4841.759999999999
like raw noise sound you get over the

4838.88 --> 4844.639
radio is literally incorporated in our

4841.76 --> 4848.84
language it is a verb you have to be

4844.639 --> 4848.84
able to pronounce that's right

4867.6 --> 4871.1990000000005
yeah

4869.28 --> 4873.28
so the norse

4871.199 --> 4875.839999999999
languages scandinavians they have all

4873.28 --> 4875.84
the weird

4877.199 --> 4880.638999999999
and we have

4879.44 --> 4882.4
[Music]

4880.639 --> 4884.159000000001
and uh

4882.4 --> 4886.239
you know we have a bit of the weird

4884.159 --> 4888.638999999999
vowel rotation that all english is

4886.239 --> 4890.239
confused by two but like the norse are

4888.639 --> 4893.76
much worse at it they have like all

4890.239 --> 4895.919999999999
these different letters for it even

4893.76 --> 4899.52
but yeah we have the

4895.92 --> 4902.719
which is quite quite unique

4899.52 --> 4907.0
sounds like i'm choking no not at all

4902.719 --> 4907.0
no it doesn't even hurt my throat

4920.159 --> 4924.5599999999995
right so what i was just doing that's

4922.0 --> 4927.44
actually like

4924.56 --> 4930.159000000001
a what do you call it a verb it's not a

4927.44 --> 4932.5599999999995
noise that i was making that's actually

4930.159 --> 4934.5599999999995
a sound you have to be able to make in

4932.56 --> 4937.04
our language if you want to speak it

4934.56 --> 4937.04
properly

4938.88 --> 4944.0
there's a lot of people that have a lot

4940.4 --> 4947.28
of trouble with that

4944.0 --> 4947.28
especially the english

4948.56 --> 4952.56
and the germans too i think

4950.88 --> 4954.400000000001
they don't really have it

4952.56 --> 4955.6
they have all the sh

4954.4 --> 4957.679
all the sh

4955.6 --> 4960.159000000001
the in the world right is all german and

4957.679 --> 4962.4
we have two but we have

4960.159 --> 4964.0
we even have

4962.4 --> 4967.36
and that's really something that just

4964.0 --> 4969.52
like blows german minds

4967.36 --> 4970.719
that you have to sh and the

4969.52 --> 4974.080000000001
in one

4970.719 --> 4976.4800000000005
single line that just like

4974.08 --> 4978.8
germans just cannot handle that and we

4976.48 --> 4981.36
used to use that in order to identify

4978.8 --> 4983.04
german spines in world war two isn't

4981.36 --> 4986.759999999999
that interesting

4983.04 --> 4986.76
that's official

4990.84 --> 4993.939
[Music]

4995.04 --> 5000.32
the south is more heavily populated in

4997.12 --> 5004.159
the netherlands for a reason

5000.32 --> 5004.159
yeah well they're more catholic

5007.44 --> 5010.759999999999
so yeah

5018.159 --> 5023.839999999999
no i never got into assassin's creed i

5020.88 --> 5026.400000000001
think it really sucks

5023.84 --> 5028.56
like i hate that game

5026.4 --> 5031.04
i think it is evil

5028.56 --> 5034.320000000001
i think the story is evil

5031.04 --> 5036.639
very very evil

5034.32 --> 5038.88
and sick and satanic i hate it i've

5036.639 --> 5041.4400000000005
watched like the movie once

5038.88 --> 5043.4400000000005
and that just immediately confirmed like

5041.44 --> 5046.08
this is just [ __ ]

5043.44 --> 5046.08
like the whole

5046.48 --> 5051.839999999999
it's like worse than even the diablo

5049.84 --> 5054.8
cosmology

5051.84 --> 5056.56
i mean it's terrible i don't like it i

5054.8 --> 5060.320000000001
don't like that game i don't like the

5056.56 --> 5060.320000000001
concept i don't like the story

5061.84 --> 5066.679
you play them all that's your problem

5063.679 --> 5066.679
then

5075.12 --> 5079.76
i mean

5076.88 --> 5081.76
i think that there's only one game more

5079.76 --> 5084.4800000000005
famous that i hate even more and that's

5081.76 --> 5084.4800000000005
the witcher

5087.12 --> 5092.659
[Music]

5116.32 --> 5120.48
i haven't played yeah good on you

5118.159 --> 5124.159
because it's not good for you the entire

5120.48 --> 5124.159
thing is like a gamma trap

5124.8 --> 5130.8
trap of darkness and self-imposed

5127.6 --> 5133.52
importance and broodiness oh

5130.8 --> 5137.719
oh we're so special

5133.52 --> 5137.719
i just hate it yeah

5141.84 --> 5146.8
yeah i can say i hate that bjc net i

5144.88 --> 5148.08
really don't liked it

5146.8 --> 5150.320000000001
no

5148.08 --> 5154.48
and like i don't like the game i think

5150.32 --> 5157.5199999999995
the game like really sucks it sucks the

5154.48 --> 5157.5199999999995
game sucks

5159.28 --> 5165.599999999999
like i can't play that game it's stupid

5163.28 --> 5167.44
like you have to like literally like

5165.6 --> 5170.08
decide to waste

5167.44 --> 5172.96
your life in order to just be able to

5170.08 --> 5177.5199999999995
play the basic game it's so annoying and

5172.96 --> 5177.52
frustrating it's not fun it sucks

5178.0 --> 5182.719
my favorite video game then anything but

5180.4 --> 5186.0
those types of games anything but that i

5182.719 --> 5188.88
don't like those games never have i'm

5186.0 --> 5191.92
much more of a strategy gamer

5188.88 --> 5196.08
i like top-down view

5191.92 --> 5198.96
or like what like uh

5196.08 --> 5200.96
like semi top down

5198.96 --> 5203.679
and that's usually a lot of strategy

5200.96 --> 5205.92
type games i have more affinity for for

5203.679 --> 5208.2390000000005
strategy games in general

5205.92 --> 5208.2390000000005
and

5209.44 --> 5212.32
that's really it

5212.48 --> 5217.36
yeah civilization five is pretty much

5215.12 --> 5220.0
the game that i've played the most

5217.36 --> 5222.0
by now although yeah

5220.0 --> 5223.679
easily followed second would be the

5222.0 --> 5225.84
balder's gate

5223.679 --> 5229.04
games

5225.84 --> 5230.8
one and two i've played that so much

5229.04 --> 5233.12
unbelievable

5230.8 --> 5233.12
and

5240.719 --> 5244.4
those are the types of games i like

5251.28 --> 5256.88
i mean also like other games

5254.159 --> 5260.08
like xcom i think that xcom is a pretty

5256.88 --> 5263.36
interesting game because of

5260.08 --> 5265.92
like when it's a very well balanced

5263.36 --> 5268.239
uh what do you call it a turn based game

5265.92 --> 5271.679
is very hard to make a well-balanced

5268.239 --> 5274.159
turn-based game it's extremely hard

5271.679 --> 5276.8
right well i thought that x-com

5274.159 --> 5278.799999999999
like even the the newer version

5276.8 --> 5280.719
because their x-com was originally very

5278.8 --> 5281.6
old game very tough i'd never played

5280.719 --> 5283.36
that

5281.6 --> 5286.4800000000005
but there was a remake

5283.36 --> 5288.32
like 2010 or something it was actually

5286.48 --> 5290.799999999999
pretty good

5288.32 --> 5293.679
so i've played that a couple of times it

5290.8 --> 5296.719
can be fun to play every now and then

5293.679 --> 5298.88
and it's a well-made game

5296.719 --> 5301.92
it has it has some bugs but it still

5298.88 --> 5301.92
works really well

5302.239 --> 5305.599999999999
uh

5303.04 --> 5305.6
but again

5305.88 --> 5310.4800000000005
semi-top-down

5307.6 --> 5312.96
strategy type games

5310.48 --> 5315.839999999999
turn based games

5312.96 --> 5317.28
like an adventure group combat

5315.84 --> 5319.84
situation

5317.28 --> 5323.759999999999
or like build your base and stuff and

5319.84 --> 5326.88
that's what i that's what i like

5323.76 --> 5326.88
those are the games i like

5333.92 --> 5338.2390000000005
dungeon keeper yeah oh yeah that's a

5336.239 --> 5341.199
long time ago but yeah dungeon keeper

5338.239 --> 5341.199
was pretty awesome

5343.44 --> 5349.36
it was kind of messed up

5346.32 --> 5351.5199999999995
but it was still pretty cool

5349.36 --> 5354.239
i've played it a lot

5351.52 --> 5354.2390000000005
back in the day

5355.199 --> 5360.879999999999
late 90s early 2000s

5358.0 --> 5360.88
around that time

5362.239 --> 5366.4
roller coaster yeah i remember that

5367.199 --> 5370.5599999999995
i mean look

5368.48 --> 5371.839999999999
those types of games you know they were

5370.56 --> 5375.4400000000005
fun

5371.84 --> 5378.2390000000005
it's just after a while it's like

5375.44 --> 5379.839999999999
it's just you're done with it it's like

5378.239 --> 5383.44
you know you know everything there's

5379.84 --> 5383.4400000000005
it's not funny doing it again

5383.84 --> 5389.12
with baldur's gate however

5386.4 --> 5390.96
i've played the game over and over again

5389.12 --> 5394.32
like 50 to

5390.96 --> 5396.56
a 200 times or something i thought okay

5394.32 --> 5399.679
i lost count a long time ago

5396.56 --> 5402.400000000001
because the music is cool the story is

5399.679 --> 5404.56
cool the voice acting is cool

5402.4 --> 5406.5599999999995
and you can like build a completely

5404.56 --> 5410.320000000001
different type of character and then

5406.56 --> 5410.320000000001
play the game with that see what happens

5410.56 --> 5414.400000000001
so those are games that i absolutely

5413.52 --> 5416.88
that are

5414.4 --> 5419.36
like infinite replay value as far as i'm

5416.88 --> 5421.36
concerned and they have been remade like

5419.36 --> 5424.719
to a higher resolution and all that and

5421.36 --> 5424.719
with the huge improvement

5425.199 --> 5427.678999999999
zelda

5428.48 --> 5432.32
yeah i did

5429.84 --> 5435.52
i had one zelda game that i've played a

5432.32 --> 5435.5199999999995
lot and that's uh

5435.6 --> 5438.96
back to the past

5437.12 --> 5442.719
from the super nintendo

5438.96 --> 5444.96
great game like that is a good good game

5442.719 --> 5447.199
i still have it like on an emulator so i

5444.96 --> 5449.92
can literally play it still

5447.199 --> 5452.159
and i have occasionally so i really i

5449.92 --> 5454.4
really like that game it's a really well

5452.159 --> 5457.759999999999
made game it's very

5454.4 --> 5459.839999999999
very exciting to play

5457.76 --> 5461.12
but that's the only zelda game i've ever

5459.84 --> 5464.04
played

5461.12 --> 5467.599999999999
i've never even tried another

yeah but all

5471.12 --> 5478.0
i've never played a first person shooter

5474.48 --> 5480.0
after half-life 2 got me so sick that i

5478.0 --> 5483.199
decided i'm never going to play

5480.0 --> 5486.56
first-person shooters again

5483.199 --> 5487.5599999999995
and i haven't i just never tried them

5486.56 --> 5489.360000000001
after

5487.56 --> 5492.88
2006.

5489.36 --> 5492.88
never tried them ever again

5495.6 --> 5500.2390000000005
wait except maybe unreal tournament 4

5502.159 --> 5507.28
but that didn't last very long either

5504.48 --> 5509.199
but i have i have that game i thought it

5507.28 --> 5513.719
was pretty good

5509.199 --> 5513.719
yeah maybe i still have like the dvd

5548.48 --> 5555.919999999999
it might be in here i can't find it

5552.0 --> 5555.92
i'd literally have to move my bed

5558.88 --> 5563.84
that's so funny i still remember the

5560.88 --> 5566.0
days where i literally just bought games

5563.84 --> 5567.92
so i have those dvds i'm still kind of

5566.0 --> 5569.679
glad that i did but

5567.92 --> 5575.0
i haven't like even

5569.679 --> 5575.0
bought any dvds in a long time

pokemon silver 200 okay jarvis

5601.28 --> 5607.599999999999
yes casey yeah of course tetris

5604.48 --> 5610.32
but tetris is like the game boy game

5607.6 --> 5610.320000000001
so i get it

5612.32 --> 5617.84
tetris is like

5613.84 --> 5617.84
a board game that you play solo

5618.96 --> 5623.28
like

5619.84 --> 5627.719
it's always kind of a fun distraction

5623.28 --> 5627.719
if you're on vacation or something

5648.08 --> 5651.08
pong

5659.84 --> 5665.1990000000005
old game boy i used like the only game

5662.88 --> 5666.639
boy game that i even remember that i

5665.199 --> 5667.36
really liked

5666.639 --> 5668.8
was

5667.36 --> 5671.759999999999
mario land

5668.8 --> 5673.360000000001
just the mario land it was really great

5671.76 --> 5674.96
to play

5673.36 --> 5676.719
i think i even like

5674.96 --> 5679.679
finished the game once

5676.719 --> 5682.159
it's very difficult

5679.679 --> 5684.4
but it's just it was so fun like on the

5682.159 --> 5688.159
gameboy it was almost even more fun than

5684.4 --> 5689.759999999999
like on the nintendo i don't know why

5688.159 --> 5692.159
good memories of that

5689.76 --> 5697.0
and like everybody had that game

5692.159 --> 5697.0
it was like the game boy game marioland

5710.96 --> 5713.96
it's

5719.84 --> 5722.84
hmm

5733.199 --> 5741.599999999999
but there's like some really ultra old

5737.36 --> 5744.4
like pc games that are really fun

5741.6 --> 5745.92
like that were on like commodore 64 i

5744.4 --> 5748.5599999999995
still don't even remember what their

5745.92 --> 5750.159
name was i just remember i had so much

5748.56 --> 5751.92
fun playing that

5750.159 --> 5754.4
because it was just like you're a thing

5751.92 --> 5757.119
you're shooting at [ __ ] and like

5754.4 --> 5758.799999999999
chaos happens all the time like weird

5757.119 --> 5760.799999999999
things fun and you don't even understand

5758.8 --> 5762.719
what the hell that is

5760.8 --> 5765.1990000000005
and just keep shooting just keep

5762.719 --> 5766.4800000000005
shooting and try to avoid [ __ ]

5765.199 --> 5768.5599999999995
god

5766.48 --> 5770.4
i have no idea what that was but that

5768.56 --> 5772.2390000000005
was such a rush

5770.4 --> 5773.759999999999
i played that like when i was six and

5772.239 --> 5775.199
[ __ ]

5773.76 --> 5777.360000000001
six

5775.199 --> 5778.96
so that's like 86

5777.36 --> 5781.599999999999
old old stuff

5778.96 --> 5784.76
i have no idea what that was called

5781.6 --> 5784.76
don't remember

5785.52 --> 5789.1990000000005
but it was like

5787.28 --> 5792.08
space invaders

5789.199 --> 5796.199
plus plus plus plus like like much more

5792.08 --> 5796.199
chaotic than space invaders

5799.199 --> 5803.5199999999995
like there would be like worms growing

5801.76 --> 5806.2390000000005
in there and like

5803.52 --> 5807.92
so many different weird [ __ ] would come

5806.239 --> 5809.839999999999
on the screen that would be really

5807.92 --> 5810.719
chaotic

5809.84 --> 5814.2390000000005
so

5810.719 --> 5814.2390000000005
i don't know what it's called though

5830.4 --> 5836.5599999999995
never played it except on other people's

5833.44 --> 5838.32
consoles but yeah goldeneye was like the

5836.56 --> 5842.56
shooter game back then

5838.32 --> 5842.5599999999995
like everybody knew that game

5843.28 --> 5847.84
was because it was like the least buggy

5846.32 --> 5850.32
online

5847.84 --> 5851.28
game where you could yeah online do

5850.32 --> 5853.5199999999995
shooter

5851.28 --> 5856.0
where it wasn't buggy like all the other

5853.52 --> 5858.320000000001
games always had bugs and [ __ ] and gold

5856.0 --> 5861.92
and i for some reason just worked really

5858.32 --> 5866.119
well it would like never crash and [ __ ]

5861.92 --> 5866.119
and that was rare back then

5870.45 --> 5876.2

5899.679 --> 5904.28
i'm glad you have a life now

5925.28 --> 5930.639
yeah i remember populis never played it

5927.52 --> 5932.56
but it was like whoa look at this

5930.639 --> 5936.159000000001
real graphics

5932.56 --> 5936.159000000001
it's not interactive but

5936.4 --> 5941.679
oh no wait that's another one ah

5939.04 --> 5943.44
i don't remember [ __ ]

5941.679 --> 5947.28
i didn't i was still playing on my

5943.44 --> 5947.28
commodore 64 back then so

5951.28 --> 5955.679
and then later i got to the amiga

5954.56 --> 5957.76
like after

5955.679 --> 5959.84
92

5957.76 --> 5963.84
to

5959.84 --> 5966.719
98 and that's when i kind of like

5963.84 --> 5970.56
bought to pay i literally bought a pc

5966.719 --> 5970.56
just to be able to play baldur's game

5971.44 --> 5976.32
yeah

5973.76 --> 5978.8
it's also when like it was

5976.32 --> 5981.36
really understood now that the amiga

5978.8 --> 5983.92
would be discontinued which was

5981.36 --> 5985.92
extremely disappointing

5983.92 --> 5988.0
because the amiga just had the best

5985.92 --> 5991.679
video game music that was around back

5988.0 --> 5994.88
then like it really did like even shitty

5991.679 --> 5998.56
games just had epic music because of the

5994.88 --> 6001.04
the sound chips from the amiga which was

5998.56 --> 6001.04
unique

6002.719 --> 6006.4
and it's literally still being used in

6004.96 --> 6008.4
retro music

6006.4 --> 6012.239
it's a really very

6008.4 --> 6012.239
great sounding chipset

6013.84 --> 6017.4400000000005
and now can be just emulated

6016.4 --> 6021.638999999999
but

6017.44 --> 6021.638999999999
it just has this unique sound

6024.239 --> 6028.638999999999
amigo 32 no 1200

6030.32 --> 6035.639
i had a 1200 which is the best one

6053.84 --> 6057.76
i was so incredibly impressed when i

6056.08 --> 6061.119
first got like a

6057.76 --> 6063.360000000001
an amiga that it had a hard disk

6061.119 --> 6065.199
still put floppy disks in but it also

6063.36 --> 6067.679
had like a hard disk and it was just

6065.199 --> 6070.5599999999995
like whoa dude

6067.679 --> 6071.92
it had like a basic windows type

6070.56 --> 6072.96
interface

6071.92 --> 6075.6
right

6072.96 --> 6079.28
did you know that did you know that

6075.6 --> 6084.0
huh that amiga had like a windows type

6079.28 --> 6086.239
interface before windows even existed

6084.0 --> 6086.239
right

6086.639 --> 6091.52
and then and then absolutely oh apple

6089.199 --> 6095.5199999999995
all now apple has this

6091.52 --> 6100.96
oh and now pc oh now windows oh yes yes

6095.52 --> 6100.96
yes amiga had it it was just there

6101.44 --> 6107.04
amiga had a windows interface when pcs

6104.56 --> 6108.320000000001
were still like

6107.04 --> 6111.44
ugh

6108.32 --> 6113.92
you had to like type in the code to get

6111.44 --> 6117.75
to the directory okay

6190.56 --> 6194.88
i'm still convinced that it was pretty

6192.8 --> 6197.52
much bill gates's fault that amiga was

6194.88 --> 6197.52
destroyed

6198.08 --> 6202.639
they like

6200.08 --> 6205.04
amiga was just attacked from all sides

6202.639 --> 6206.8
like bill gates was trying to like just

6205.04 --> 6209.28
destroy

the value of the company like dirty

6209.28 --> 6212.4
tricks

6210.4 --> 6214.08
and he was buying up other [ __ ] and all

6212.4 --> 6217.679
that back then

6214.08 --> 6221.36
and then like some [ __ ] [ __ ] at the

6217.679 --> 6223.4400000000005
top of amiga like like a numpty [ __ ]

6221.36 --> 6224.5599999999995
corporate house

6223.44 --> 6227.119
decided

6224.56 --> 6230.320000000001
we're gonna make a gaming console which

6227.119 --> 6233.44
was like the worst gaming console in

6236.0 --> 6241.44
that were like worse

6241.44 --> 6244.879999999999
worse

6242.48 --> 6247.199

commodore company terrible i hated that

6268.0 --> 6272.96
that it's a it's a dead dream now but i

6270.56 --> 6274.56
used to dream like that amiga would take

6272.96 --> 6275.84
over the world that it would be the

standard

6275.84 --> 6280.96
and like who the [ __ ] needs video game

6278.0 --> 6284.56
consoles when you get an amiga like you

6280.96 --> 6288.639
don't need a freaking game console if

6284.56 --> 6290.96
you have an amiga it can do anything and

6288.639 --> 6293.28
if you want you can do like your

administration on it too

6293.28 --> 6298.48
right

6295.36 --> 6298.48

6319.36 --> 6324.48
amiga sold better in europe than it did

and bill gates numpty slave yeah

6331.04 --> 6334.96
and now bill gates got all your farmland

6333.36 --> 6336.799999999999
huh huh

6334.96 --> 6338.88
yeah so of course you didn't know

6336.8 --> 6341.119000000001
anything about the amiga

6338.88 --> 6344.119
because you're all numpty slaves over

6341.119 --> 6344.119
there

6368.8 --> 6373.84
right i still remember like me and my

6370.96 --> 6376.32
brother we were a lot into amiga and we

6373.84 --> 6379.28
would go like to

6376.32 --> 6382.48
computer nerd conventions

6379.28 --> 6385.5199999999995
yeah i did that before fluttered meetups

6382.48 --> 6388.0
yeah we had amiga meetups

6385.52 --> 6390.719
and like like every super nerd with

6388.0 --> 6393.04
their glasses awkward would come over

6390.719 --> 6395.92
there it would literally be like a nerd

6393.04 --> 6398.719
convention like way

6395.92 --> 6401.36
way worse more nerdy

6398.719 --> 6403.76
than any anime

6401.36 --> 6406.08
or gamers convention now where like most

6403.76 --> 6408.08
of them are just like random weirdos and

6406.08 --> 6413.04
larpers and gays

6408.08 --> 6415.84
right no no no you go to the 80s and 90s

6413.04 --> 6417.199
nerd conventions

6415.84 --> 6418.639
and then all the nerds would come

6417.199 --> 6420.4
together and you would just be walking

6418.639 --> 6421.76
around looking at what they were playing

6420.4 --> 6423.119
because yeah you're not gonna talk

6421.76 --> 6424.2390000000005
they're nerfed they're just gonna play

6423.119 --> 6425.839999999999
the games

6424.239 --> 6428.879999999999
right but you would look around and be

6425.84 --> 6430.56
like oh what's that game can i copy that

6428.88 --> 6432.400000000001
because it was just like yeah [ __ ] that

6430.56 --> 6433.76
we're all just gonna copy each other's

6432.4 --> 6437.36
games

6433.76 --> 6439.76
it was like a a nerd game orgy

6437.36 --> 6440.96
where everybody could just exchange

6439.76 --> 6443.52
games

6440.96 --> 6445.52
and we would and like thousands and

6443.52 --> 6448.400000000001
thousands of video games would be copied

6445.52 --> 6450.96
on such conventions it was brilliant

6448.4 --> 6455.4
was like the best experience

6450.96 --> 6455.4
nerd experience ever

6456.239 --> 6460.718999999999
it was so great and like they were all

6459.679 --> 6464.159
nerds

6460.719 --> 6467.679
and not nerds of now they were like old

6464.159 --> 6471.719
nerd they were actually nerds

6467.679 --> 6471.719
not stupid gays

6475.679 --> 6480.4
and it was like

6477.119 --> 6481.44
like literally no girls there like no

6480.4 --> 6483.5199999999995
girls

6481.44 --> 6485.36
like ever

6483.52 --> 6487.4400000000005
ever

6485.36 --> 6489.679
only nerds

6487.44 --> 6492.96
i was like already kind of out of place

6489.679 --> 6495.119
there because i didn't have glasses

6492.96 --> 6496.96
and i wasn't a programmer

6495.119 --> 6498.639
i was just kind of there for the game so

6496.96 --> 6500.8
even when i went there and i had the

6498.639 --> 6503.679
time of my life i was kind of out of

6500.8 --> 6506.4800000000005
place because i wasn't actually a nerd

6503.679 --> 6506.4800000000005
not like them

6509.76 --> 6515.4400000000005
lawn parties yeah but lan parties came

6512.48 --> 6516.638999999999
all later dude lan parties is like late

6515.44 --> 6518.638999999999
90s

6516.639 --> 6521.28
when the internet came right when the

6518.639 --> 6524.2390000000005
internet came the nerd conventions were

6521.28 --> 6526.5599999999995
over was over because the nerds didn't

6524.239 --> 6528.718999999999
actually want to do that they didn't

6526.56 --> 6531.4400000000005
want to come together all in a giant

6528.719 --> 6534.56
pool of nerds they just wanted to stay

6531.44 --> 6536.5599999999995
at home well the internet made sure that

6534.56 --> 6538.88
oh finally we don't have to go to the

6536.56 --> 6540.400000000001
nerd convention and show how incredibly

6538.88 --> 6542.08
nerdy we are

6540.4 --> 6543.04
we could just do it through the internet

6542.08 --> 6545.5199999999995
now

6543.04 --> 6548.5199999999995
so it was the end of those gaming

6545.52 --> 6548.52
conventions

6563.92 --> 6568.28
what's between nerds and geeks

6569.04 --> 6573.28
nerds are old style geeks are

6577.199 --> 6581.119
more quirky

6579.119 --> 6583.679
nerds are like

6581.119 --> 6585.92
not very sociable geeks are more like

6583.679 --> 6588.32
weird quirky

6585.92 --> 6588.32
people

6588.4 --> 6593.199
that just

6589.44 --> 6594.96
really like odd things that's a geek

6593.199 --> 6597.598999999999
the nerd is just like

6594.96 --> 6601.52
leave me alone i just want to do this

6597.599 --> 6601.52
brilliant thing here on my computer

6604.159 --> 6609.5199999999995
and geeks just have like weird awkward

6607.04 --> 6613.119
things they like

6609.52 --> 6615.040000000001
so geeks are often more like artists

6613.119 --> 6617.759999999999
while nerds really are typically

6615.04 --> 6617.76
programmers

6618.0 --> 6625.84
it in my experience right

6621.44 --> 6625.839999999999
that's how i kind of see it so

6629.28 --> 6634.88
geeks are try hard to want to be

6631.28 --> 6634.88
sometimes they can be

6640.8 --> 6646.8
in that sense i was a bit of a geek

6643.92 --> 6646.8
and not a nerd

6647.28 --> 6651.4
although i knew i'm not a nerd

6677.679 --> 6683.92
right man how long

6680.88 --> 6683.92
time has been flying

6686.32 --> 6690.199
guess we're having fun

6700.32 --> 6704.08
yeah pjc yeah the crackers yeah but

6702.719 --> 6705.92
that's the whole that was the whole

6704.08 --> 6709.28
point everything was cracked all the

6705.92 --> 6711.76
games were cracked all of it

6709.28 --> 6714.0
it's like the only sales of games that

6711.76 --> 6717.52
were even made

6714.0 --> 6720.84
whether it's like pc or or amiga

6717.52 --> 6724.2390000000005
was by crackers to crack

6720.84 --> 6726.96
it they would just buy it and just like

6724.239 --> 6729.678999999999
okay now everybody has this

6726.96 --> 6730.96
and that's like how it spread around

6729.679 --> 6735.28
i

6730.96 --> 6737.36
i think i like only saw a a bot game

6735.28 --> 6740.48
like one time

6737.36 --> 6742.799999999999
i've seen a bot game like once

6740.48 --> 6744.4
that's it like all the other thousands

6742.8 --> 6747.360000000001
of games that i've ever had on my

6744.4 --> 6751.48
commodore 64 or amiga 1200 were all

6747.36 --> 6751.48
cracked all of it

6754.0 --> 6757.199
sort of the good old days

6757.52 --> 6762.84
and the copy protection things sucked

6760.32 --> 6765.92
they really sucked back then

6762.84 --> 6767.92
like if the crackers hadn't stepped in

6765.92 --> 6770.8
and done what they'd done there's a good

6767.92 --> 6773.92
chance the video game industry

6770.8 --> 6776.400000000001
would have completely imploded and then

6773.92 --> 6780.2390000000005
we wouldn't have a gaming industry right

6776.4 --> 6782.799999999999
now serious i'm not even joking

6780.239 --> 6785.28
copy protection was so terrible that it

6782.8 --> 6787.4400000000005
was off-putting to people like they just

6785.28 --> 6788.5599999999995
didn't want to buy it anymore it sucked

6787.44 --> 6790.96
too bad

6788.56 --> 6792.400000000001
so that's where the crackers came in and

6790.96 --> 6795.679
they just

6792.4 --> 6797.598999999999
they just took the games and like

6795.679 --> 6799.84
took all the crap out of it the crack

6797.599 --> 6801.52
the security crap and then it was a

6799.84 --> 6802.4800000000005
great game and now everybody knew the

6801.52 --> 6804.0
game

6802.48 --> 6805.598999999999
and they loved the game

6804.0 --> 6808.56
that they wouldn't have because they

6805.599 --> 6810.08
wouldn't have bought it with the crappy

6808.56 --> 6812.320000000001
crappy ass

6810.08 --> 6813.92
copy protection [ __ ]

6812.32 --> 6816.4
which sucked

6813.92 --> 6819.599
everybody hated it nobody wanted it like

6816.4 --> 6819.598999999999
those companies like

6819.679 --> 6824.4800000000005
like they didn't respond

6822.0 --> 6826.159
like they they learned that that was

6824.48 --> 6829.759999999999
even happening and they still just

6826.159 --> 6829.759999999999
refused to stop doing that

6829.92 --> 6836.4800000000005
they insisted stupid ass copy protection

6833.52 --> 6839.280000000001
crap that everybody hates

6836.48 --> 6841.678999999999
that nobody wanted that people probably

6839.28 --> 6843.92
would have paid for more

6841.679 --> 6846.92
if it didn't have that i'm not even

6843.92 --> 6846.92
kidding

6853.599 --> 6859.360000000001
right but then i think that that same

6856.48 --> 6861.28
copy protection racket i'm gonna call it

6859.36 --> 6863.598999999999
a racket because it was completely

6861.28 --> 6865.599
useless and everybody hated it

6863.599 --> 6867.28
i think that they kind of moved away

6865.599 --> 6869.599
from video games

6867.28 --> 6873.04
to when the dvd

6869.599 --> 6875.599
and the blu-ray things came out

6873.04 --> 6877.44
right dvd players

6875.599 --> 6880.719
i think that they kind of jumped ship

6877.44 --> 6882.719
from computer game security [ __ ]

6880.719 --> 6885.599
to like oh that's let's we're going to

6882.719 --> 6887.52
do that with the dvds now and the dvds

6885.599 --> 6889.679
became very popular so

6887.52 --> 6891.360000000001
they kind of switched

6889.679 --> 6892.8
targets

6891.36 --> 6895.119
good

6892.8 --> 6897.04
that probably saved the video game

6895.119 --> 6897.45
industry that they stopped doing that

6897.04 --> 6899.199
crap

6897.45 --> 6902.239
[Music]

6899.199 --> 6904.719
and after that yeah video games were

6902.239 --> 6908.5599999999995
probably more bought

6904.719 --> 6913.44
than ever before because the stupid

6908.56 --> 6915.76
copy protection racket [ __ ] off

6913.44 --> 6918.638999999999
they [ __ ] off so now people suddenly

6915.76 --> 6921.76
start buying your product again you dumb

6918.639 --> 6923.76
[ __ ] why did you wait like two decades

6921.76 --> 6927.360000000001
to do that you should have kicked those

6923.76 --> 6930.2390000000005
[ __ ] out of there right away

6927.36 --> 6933.119
and you would have had record profits

6930.239 --> 6934.32
record

6933.119 --> 6937.759999999999
but no

6934.32 --> 6940.639
copy protection yeah almost destroyed

6937.76 --> 6943.1990000000005
the industry didn't it huh huh

6940.639 --> 6946.92
dumbasses

6943.199 --> 6946.919999999999
corporate wankers

6950.51 --> 6953.68
[Music]

6962.719 --> 6967.76
that's right pj i see that yeah so they

6965.04 --> 6970.719
should just [ __ ] off and die

6967.76 --> 6973.1990000000005
like stop it it's not gonna work it's

6970.719 --> 6975.92

6975.92 --> 6981.36
they're willing to like invest multiple

6978.56 --> 6984.159000000001
generations of ensuring that everything

6981.36 --> 6988.0
you do is completely pointless

6984.159 --> 6990.799999999999
yeah so just [ __ ] off with your [ __ ]

6988.0 --> 6993.0

oh because it's also nostalgic oh

7119.04 --> 7123.599
heartstrings or we could just

7121.599 --> 7127.04
think about what happened

7123.599 --> 7130.2390000000005
right remember what actually happened

7127.04 --> 7131.76
back then i know you were all in it at

7138.88 --> 7142.56
why don't we think about what was really

7141.44 --> 7144.96
happening

7142.56 --> 7146.320000000001
around us think back

7144.96 --> 7149.36
back then you didn't have the time you

7146.32 --> 7151.599
were just doing stuff right

7149.36 --> 7153.92
now think back what actually all

7151.599 --> 7156.4800000000005
happened what happened in the 80s what

7153.92 --> 7158.8
happened in the 90s how did things work

7156.48 --> 7161.199
how did things develop there's so much

7158.8 --> 7164.0
we can all learn

7161.199 --> 7167.678999999999
from our experience back then

7164.0 --> 7169.36
it was a time of computer development

7167.679 --> 7172.0
right where it was literally like

7169.36 --> 7174.159
springing up grassroots from programmers

7172.0 --> 7176.4
that were doing it all on their own

7174.159 --> 7178.799999999999
right it's an important time to reflect

7176.4 --> 7181.28
upon

7178.8 --> 7182.4800000000005
the even in the face of situations of

7181.28 --> 7183.679
now

7182.48 --> 7185.598999999999
because

7183.679 --> 7187.52
we just need to learn

7185.599 --> 7189.679
from the mistakes back then or they're

7187.52 --> 7192.88
gonna slip back in they're gonna get

7189.679 --> 7194.4800000000005
right back i mean corporate [ __ ]

7192.88 --> 7196.639
that ruin

7194.48 --> 7197.44
software

7196.639 --> 7200.32
like

7197.44 --> 7203.678999999999
that's not over right it's not over yet

7200.32 --> 7205.679
those asses corporate asses

7203.679 --> 7207.679
still are out there

7205.679 --> 7209.92
and if we all don't like

7207.679 --> 7212.08
get sharp on how this works and what the

7209.92 --> 7215.119
mistakes were in the past then it's

7212.08 --> 7218.4
probably gonna return

7215.119 --> 7222.08
yeah those pieces of [ __ ] are probably

7218.4 --> 7222.879999999999
gonna return if we are not vigilant and

7222.08 --> 7225.28
learn

7222.88 --> 7227.92
from the mistakes in the past and be

7225.28 --> 7229.759999999999
very vigilant about it

7227.92 --> 7233.679
it's very important to

7229.76 --> 7233.679
learn from those past events

7233.84 --> 7238.719
or they're going to be repeated right

7236.56 --> 7240.56
well oh what everything changed now oh

7238.719 --> 7241.76
the industry is all different and like

7240.56 --> 7244.0
yeah

7241.76 --> 7244.96
but the cyclical nature

7244.0 --> 7248.0
is

7244.96 --> 7250.0
it's still gonna return if you ignore it

7248.0 --> 7253.199
if you don't learn from it's still gonna

7250.0 --> 7256.239
return doesn't matter if we're 30 years

7253.199 --> 7258.4
later 40 years later it doesn't matter

7256.239 --> 7260.718999999999
it's still cyclical even though

7258.4 --> 7264.08
everything seems to have changed the

7260.719 --> 7266.4800000000005
cyclical nature is still there we're not

7264.08 --> 7269.36
vigilant that same crap

7266.48 --> 7273.119
that we all had to deal with 30 40 years

7269.36 --> 7274.08
ago is gonna return even now

7273.119 --> 7277.199
right

7274.08 --> 7279.92
just like this disgusting

7277.199 --> 7282.638999999999
bank heads mega corporation hats that

7279.92 --> 7285.119
are like old farts from like the early

7282.639 --> 7287.76
20th century

7285.119 --> 7290.0
they're still doing their [ __ ]

7287.76 --> 7294.719
they're still inserting their way

7290.0 --> 7297.52
outdated principles and methods

7294.719 --> 7299.639
like that are just not welcome anymore

7297.52 --> 7303.119000000001
recycling it

7299.639 --> 7306.2390000000005
re-cycle they cycle over and over and

7303.119 --> 7307.44
over again and they just keep going

7306.239 --> 7309.598999999999
why

7307.44 --> 7311.36
because in all that time we haven't

7309.599 --> 7312.56
really learned

7311.36 --> 7315.199
we haven't

7312.56 --> 7317.52
like we're not immune to them you have

7315.199 --> 7319.04
to learn what they're doing how they're

7317.52 --> 7322.2390000000005
doing and how they're getting away with

7319.04 --> 7324.32
it in order to build up public

7322.239 --> 7326.48
immunity

7324.32 --> 7330.48
to what they do

7326.48 --> 7334.239
if you don't the cycle is gonna recycle

7330.48 --> 7336.5599999999995
over and over and over again and then

7334.239 --> 7339.36
before you know it your grandchildren

7336.56 --> 7341.04
are gonna have the exact same problems

7339.36 --> 7344.639
as you did

7341.04 --> 7346.4
the exact same problems

7344.639 --> 7348.2390000000005
you've got to learn

7346.4 --> 7350.08
in order to help

7348.239 --> 7352.879999999999
avoid

7350.08 --> 7355.5199999999995
the cycles that are unwanted from coming

7352.88 --> 7355.52
back again

7355.76 --> 7358.88
so

7357.119 --> 7361.5199999999995
how's my twitter account doing i don't

7358.88 --> 7364.159000000001
know pretty well i think

7361.52 --> 7368.639
i've been thrown off yet

7364.159 --> 7368.638999999999
i got six follow of four followers

7368.8 --> 7373.76
like yeah so it's fine

7371.52 --> 7377.360000000001
i mean it's it's just two days old and i

7373.76 --> 7380.56
wasn't expecting to explode or anything

7377.36 --> 7382.88
but yeah i'm getting some attention and

7380.56 --> 7386.400000000001
doing fine

7382.88 --> 7386.400000000001
so yeah follow me on twitter

7387.92 --> 7391.67
link is in the description

7390.159 --> 7394.8589999999995
box

7391.67 --> 7394.859
[Music]

7399.679 --> 7405.4
yeah i know pgcnet

7402.159 --> 7405.4
that's right

7410.32 --> 7415.719
hmm

7411.36 --> 7415.719
that's cool george sanford yeah

7422.159 --> 7426.48
right yeah if you never vax people

7425.119 --> 7428.719
grow older

7426.48 --> 7431.199
more healthy

7428.719 --> 7434.159
that's just universal rule because

7431.199 --> 7437.598999999999
vaccines are all crap

7434.159 --> 7440.48
they're a fraudulent industry

7437.599 --> 7442.2390000000005
and its time is going to come

7440.48 --> 7444.718999999999
it's going to be over and it's going to

7442.239 --> 7447.44
be incredibly embarrassing when we all

7444.719 --> 7448.56
realize that it had to take like 200

7447.44 --> 7451.36
years

7448.56 --> 7453.119000000001
for us to realize that it was 100

7451.36 --> 7456.96
percent fake

7453.119 --> 7459.5199999999995
yeah 200 years

7456.96 --> 7463.44
really it took us like

7459.52 --> 7465.599
six generate six eight generations

7463.44 --> 7468.32
before we can finally

7465.599 --> 7470.4800000000005
kill this thing off

7468.32 --> 7472.239
and only because it's trying to kill us

7470.48 --> 7474.48
off

7472.239 --> 7477.36
i mean like we really

7474.48 --> 7481.04
like it it took 200 years to figure this

7477.36 --> 7483.199
out how incredibly embarrassing right if

7481.04 --> 7484.8
there was like anything about it that

7483.199 --> 7488.719
was real

7484.8 --> 7491.52
then i get it like yeah keep it alive

7488.719 --> 7494.159
but this

7491.52 --> 7496.0
like what it is what it does is it's all

7494.159 --> 7498.719
just

7496.0 --> 7500.639
nonsense it's all necromancy eugenics

7498.719 --> 7502.96
it's just like oh we're gonna help you

7500.639 --> 7505.599
no actually we're killing you and then

7502.96 --> 7508.4
we're gonna use you as an example

7505.599 --> 7510.719
for others why we they need that same

7508.4 --> 7512.32
treatment that is going to kill them

7510.719 --> 7514.2390000000005
because we're going to make them afraid

7512.32 --> 7517.44
if they don't do it it's going to kill

7514.239 --> 7521.119
them so just reversed world necromancy

7517.44 --> 7522.96
eugenics killing off people yeah that's

7521.119 --> 7526.4
vaccination industry it's been around

7522.96 --> 7527.36
for most for like 200 years how can this

7526.4 --> 7529.598999999999
happen

7527.36 --> 7533.28
how can this happen

7529.599 --> 7534.400000000001
how can we keep buying into this for 200

7533.28 --> 7536.239
years

7534.4 --> 7539.199
ridiculous

7536.239 --> 7539.199
embarrassing

7539.84 --> 7545.360000000001
