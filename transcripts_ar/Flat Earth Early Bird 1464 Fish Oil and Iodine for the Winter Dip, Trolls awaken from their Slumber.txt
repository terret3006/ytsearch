yeah

105.479 --> 109.5
we'll see

107.579 --> 111.83999999999999
I mean this year is going to be an

109.5 --> 115.16
expensive year overall

111.84 --> 116.759
because of obvious reasons

115.16 --> 119.84
[Music]

116.759 --> 119.84
The Siege

120.18 --> 123.96000000000001
but yeah I still have

122.22 --> 125.7
plenty of confidence that I can pull

123.96 --> 128.64
through

125.7 --> 131.64000000000001
with the help of you guys because

128.64 --> 133.14
yeah I mean without support I wouldn't

131.64 --> 135.05999999999997
be here

133.14 --> 138.05999999999997
not because I wouldn't want to but

135.06 --> 141.06
because I wouldn't be able to get around

138.06 --> 144.66
anyway so the weather

141.06 --> 147.02
is kind of sucky today it's raining and

144.66 --> 147.02
yeah

147.42 --> 153.379
try to get the rain off the window but

150.12 --> 153.379
it just got right back on

157.14 --> 163.2
it's rainy kind of steady rainy

161.22 --> 167.42
which I do not like because I have to go

163.2 --> 167.42
through this later for groceries

169.41 --> 173.819
[Music]

171.36 --> 174.54000000000002
and it's been storming by the way in the

173.819 --> 178.94
night

174.54 --> 178.94
it was like really unnerving

179.9 --> 184.20000000000002
it's just like in the middle of the

182.22 --> 186.739
night it started to really storm hey

184.2 --> 186.73899999999998
what's this

189.239 --> 193.519
the blackout what the hell is going on

194.6 --> 202.739
[Music]

199.739 --> 202.739
okay

204.06 --> 207.98
okay never makes sense when that happens

212.76 --> 217.07999999999998
right

214.62 --> 219.3
hello generally first in chat good to

217.08 --> 223.04000000000002
see you

219.3 --> 224.94
it is Wednesday the 20 uh December

223.04 --> 228.9
28th

224.94 --> 231.07999999999998
28th of September 2022

228.9 --> 231.08
foreign

233.97 --> 237.659
[Music]

235.379 --> 240.959
it's weird because

237.659 --> 245.459
from a certain perspective it seems like

240.959 --> 249.239
this went by in a Flash but then when I

245.459 --> 251.58
basically start to dig into it

249.239 --> 253.98000000000002
but everything happened then I started

251.58 --> 255.17000000000002
to realize no no it actually took a very

253.98 --> 258.59999999999997
long time

255.17 --> 261.139
[Music]

258.6 --> 261.139
anyway

264.78 --> 270.05999999999995
I mean the year always to people seems

267.6 --> 272.41900000000004
like it went by quick when it's almost

270.06 --> 272.419
over

275.0 --> 280.5
anyway right

277.62 --> 282.84000000000003
so how are you doing

280.5 --> 287.16
I'm doing pretty good

282.84 --> 290.419
a pretty good sleep not too late

287.16 --> 290.41900000000004
not too early either

292.32 --> 296.82
uh

294.24 --> 299.1
was watching some Owen Benjamin great

296.82 --> 301.01
stuff hilarious

299.1 --> 302.82000000000005
he was playing the uh

301.01 --> 304.259
[Music]

302.82 --> 305.94
is it

304.259 --> 308.52000000000004
the

305.94 --> 310.979
the Bing

308.52 --> 312.12
comedy sketch again about the Christmas

310.979 --> 314.03999999999996
singer

312.12 --> 316.56
Christmas song singer that constantly

314.04 --> 318.86
gets dirty in the mind it's it's really

316.56 --> 318.86
funny

319.32 --> 324.36
very funny

321.66 --> 327.139
so I was enjoying that pretty much right

324.36 --> 327.139
before the show

337.32 --> 340.34
hello hello

342.12 --> 345.12
okay

350.12 --> 353.479
there's everybody

354.4 --> 357.96
[Music]

355.68 --> 359.58
or maybe you all are expecting me to

357.96 --> 363.29999999999995
start an hour later

359.58 --> 365.82
now this period

363.3 --> 367.979
because people are probably staying up a

365.82 --> 371.09999999999997
little later than normal

367.979 --> 372.39
ah hey Brandon Cook good to see you hope

371.1 --> 376.079
you're doing better today

372.39 --> 376.079
[Music]

384.479 --> 389.58
if you were truly as Delirious as you

387.96 --> 392.15999999999997
said you were yesterday then you

389.58 --> 394.81899999999996
probably have a slight hangover

392.16 --> 394.819
today

400.8 --> 404.3
hope it was worth it

408.06 --> 422.519
yeah yeah I know

410.79 --> 422.519
[Music]

439.319 --> 442.319

[Music]

447.03 --> 450.34999999999997
[Applause]

454.04 --> 457.35900000000004
[Music]

459.06 --> 463.58
I'm a bit slow starting up

464.699 --> 468.12
I'm trying to figure out what was going

467.16 --> 470.639
on

468.12 --> 472.979
right I'm starting to remember

470.639 --> 475.40000000000003
first I'm trying to find if my comment's

472.979 --> 475.4
still here

487.639 --> 491.12
oh my God

492.24 --> 496.639
uh

494.88 --> 499.68
yeah

496.639 --> 503.78000000000003
all right

499.68 --> 503.78000000000003
oh God so many comments

506.06 --> 515.678
ears have a topic

509.53 --> 515.678
[Music]

516.919 --> 520.76
what the hell does that mean

528.36 --> 534.3000000000001
anyway yeah I was watching

531.959 --> 536.04
Jim mob yesterday yeah there was no flat

534.3 --> 539.279
Earth debates

536.04 --> 543.0
just the premiere and Premiere later and

539.279 --> 545.1
it was fun hanging there but I mean yeah

543.0 --> 548.94
but Nathan did say

545.1 --> 550.08
they heard him watched him say it in

548.94 --> 554.1800000000001
chat

550.08 --> 554.1800000000001
he is gonna do a live show today

557.04 --> 559.88
uh

561.36 --> 569.04
right I was watching Jim Bob

565.019 --> 571.44
and was yeah there was this guy on there

569.04 --> 573.959
I was basically giving his own

571.44 --> 576.899
perspective

573.959 --> 579.959
of religion and I thought it was

576.899 --> 582.66
actually pretty decent it was a very

579.959 --> 585.4799999999999
interesting thing it was yeah with Jim

582.66 --> 588.48
Bob and Posh and they did get it like

585.48 --> 591.3000000000001
they did let a little bit of Priestly

588.48 --> 594.36
manipulation Behavior get in there

591.3 --> 596.5999999999999
and I kind of went off about it in the

594.36 --> 596.6
chat

598.32 --> 603.899
I I basically did what what would be

600.899 --> 606.54
considered for those who know who that

603.899 --> 608.9
is I did a Rasta hat on him

606.54 --> 611.88
but not Fallout

608.9 --> 615.0
[Music]

611.88 --> 618.4399999999999
using a lot of your innuendo

615.0 --> 618.44
right but

618.72 --> 624.5600000000001
it wasn't interesting

620.94 --> 624.5600000000001
show to sit through

624.6 --> 628.399
and just doing my comments

630.12 --> 635.3
laying down my view

633.3 --> 639.8599999999999
or Christianity and the whole

635.3 --> 639.8599999999999
perspective on Paul and all that

649.019 --> 655.87
right what else

652.65 --> 655.87
[Music]

661.339 --> 664.4590000000001
all right

683.03 --> 686.049
[Music]

689.24 --> 696.48
I don't know what was I doing

693.66 --> 700.399
just that

696.48 --> 700.399
you know watch a movie or something

714.6 --> 719.66
I'm a little fuzzy

717.18 --> 719.66
today

720.6 --> 726.0790000000001
see I thought I downloaded a bunch of

722.64 --> 726.079
stuff what was it

740.459 --> 745.56
um

741.5 --> 747.54
no wow right now remember

745.56 --> 749.88
nope

747.54 --> 751.74
just watching old videos

749.88 --> 753.72
for fun

751.74 --> 757.04
to distract me

753.72 --> 757.0400000000001
what the [ __ ] generally

758.579 --> 761.3
bro

769.5 --> 773.48
not watching porn thanks

775.45 --> 781.9200000000001
[Music]

778.44 --> 783.8900000000001
Hey DJ one deck house music

781.92 --> 787.13
good to see you

783.89 --> 787.13
[Music]

790.82 --> 794.119
[Music]

812.16 --> 817.86
was also interesting because I was at

815.94 --> 819.74
dinner I was still eating like some of

817.86 --> 823.5
the

819.74 --> 826.399
uh black sour chicken

823.5 --> 826.399
and I mean

827.16 --> 831.7199999999999
there's so many herb or like uh spices

830.339 --> 833.7600000000001
in there

831.72 --> 835.5600000000001
not that it's like overdone but it's

833.76 --> 840.26
like there is a lot of stuff in there

835.56 --> 840.26
like cinnamon and clove and

842.639 --> 845.54
other things

845.88 --> 852.24
probably but

849.06 --> 854.579
it's just so different from what I

852.24 --> 856.44
typically I mean I don't really marinate

854.579 --> 859.5
meat

856.44 --> 861.7790000000001
and it just does something to you I had

859.5 --> 864.12
the same effect

861.779 --> 866.279
like during Christmas dinner while I was

864.12 --> 868.98
eating I had like several moments where

866.279 --> 870.3
I had like my ear would just like poop

868.98 --> 875.54
and start

870.3 --> 875.54
beeping but like that's usually a sign

878.16 --> 882.54
that's pretty good

879.899 --> 884.1
unless I don't know starts to hurt or

882.54 --> 886.26
you get dizzy or something that that

884.1 --> 888.12
didn't happen but that happened like

886.26 --> 890.279
three times during Christmas dinner and

888.12 --> 893.1
when I was eating it again

890.279 --> 896.48
it happened again and was like what

893.1 --> 896.48
what is that

896.579 --> 901.9399999999999
it just does something to you it's it's

898.86 --> 901.94
very fascinating

903.12 --> 908.24
and it immediately got me back in that

905.279 --> 908.24
Spirit again too

908.639 --> 912.12
you were so bloated after your Christmas

910.68 --> 914.6389999999999
dude

912.12 --> 916.98
yeah that happens a lot

914.639 --> 918.66
we specifically had a conversation about

916.98 --> 921.48
it

918.66 --> 922.98
as we were like reaching the end of the

921.48 --> 926.24
dinner

922.98 --> 930.48
how well my dad always used to do that

926.24 --> 933.36
and me too and we were both

930.48 --> 935.22
like my stepmother not but she's like a

933.36 --> 936.48
pretty small person

935.22 --> 938.399
[Music]

936.48 --> 941.04
very slim

938.399 --> 943.98
also so she just doesn't eat that much

941.04 --> 946.4399999999999
anyway never has never fit it it's just

943.98 --> 948.899
a bit

946.44 --> 951.6600000000001
but yeah we were talking about how we're

948.899 --> 954.72
both like eating less actually

951.66 --> 958.199
and like I was referring to my own

954.72 --> 961.1990000000001
lifestyle how I eat less and even like

958.199 --> 963.7199999999999
like I only have half a dinner really on

961.199 --> 965.959
a regular basis and that that works just

963.72 --> 965.9590000000001
fine

967.26 --> 975.18
and that it does definitely keep me

971.1 --> 978.6
looking forward to like eating

975.18 --> 982.16
more like a reward than just like oh

978.6 --> 982.16
this is where I have to eat

983.399 --> 988.74
so neither of us got really stuffed even

986.04 --> 990.36
though the chicken was very tempting

988.74 --> 993.86
there were still some chunks over and I

990.36 --> 993.86
was like oh I want to taste it again

994.139 --> 996.6800000000001
right

997.8 --> 1001.04
but yeah you got to be careful with

999.6 --> 1003.38
stuffing

1001.04 --> 1005.5999999999999
literally because that's what people

1003.38 --> 1010.06
haven't eaten turkeys and all that but

1005.6 --> 1010.0600000000001
just stuffing yourself too full with it

1020.06 --> 1024.44
you have to finish it right

1025.819 --> 1030.98
well or

1028.76 --> 1032.839
but this is it's difficult because you

1030.98 --> 1034.88
really have to have like a very

1032.839 --> 1036.9189999999999
proficient

1034.88 --> 1038.179
planner type cook

1036.919 --> 1040.459
I mean

1038.179 --> 1042.0790000000002
if you typically do the same type of

1040.459 --> 1044.48
meal every time

1042.079 --> 1046.52
and it's not like random situations

1044.48 --> 1049.76
where people bring their own versions

1046.52 --> 1052.1
over but that it's all like

1049.76 --> 1054.679
mate

1052.1 --> 1057.3799999999999
there whatever that yeah you know the

1054.679 --> 1059.419
portions and there's no unexpected like

1057.38 --> 1061.94
oh people might come extra and then

1059.419 --> 1064.76
you'll need more right because

1061.94 --> 1066.559
then you can like perfectly size up how

1064.76 --> 1068.24
much you actually need

1066.559 --> 1071.12
as a good cook

1068.24 --> 1073.76
and then you won't have the problems oh

1071.12 --> 1074.8999999999999
I can't leave it I have to finish it

1073.76 --> 1077.0
right

1074.9 --> 1079.22
you could have attempted to do that way

1077.0 --> 1081.88
but you have to have pretty rigorous

1079.22 --> 1081.88
schedule

1082.4 --> 1089.679
and no unexpected guests

1085.88 --> 1089.679
or yeah maybe eventually

1091.76 --> 1095.62
also vegetarian what

1096.5 --> 1100.52
okay

1098.78 --> 1104.559
well what are you roasting then if

1100.52 --> 1104.559
you're vegetarian that's weird

1109.34 --> 1114.98
or are you generally a vegetarian but

1112.58 --> 1117.559
you do eat

1114.98 --> 1119.3600000000001
turkey or something at Christmas I mean

1117.559 --> 1122.9189999999999
that's a way to go about if you're not

1119.36 --> 1122.9189999999999
like a strict vegetarian

1133.82 --> 1139.6
let me see what are you talking about

1136.28 --> 1139.6
Rand cook what are you doing

1151.34 --> 1157.1599999999999
right shout out to fiber oats by the way

1154.4 --> 1160.1200000000001
just a shout out because well fiber out

1157.16 --> 1160.1200000000001
seem to have a little

1161.12 --> 1167.6599999999999
tough tense times

1164.179 --> 1169.76
and at least G2

1167.66 --> 1172.46
so yeah

1169.76 --> 1174.5
I mean you don't have to show up if it

1172.46 --> 1177.94
if you like need to like some time for

1174.5 --> 1177.94
yourself or something I get it

1178.52 --> 1183.9189999999999
but yeah I really I am thinking about

1180.86 --> 1186.62
you I really hope you guys are gonna

1183.919 --> 1189.1000000000001
climb out of that I'll do my best to try

1186.62 --> 1189.1
and help you

1194.12 --> 1198.26
and yeah I haven't really called My

1196.1 --> 1201.76
Healer yet

1198.26 --> 1201.76
but I'll bring it up

1201.86 --> 1206.059
I'm sure he'll do he'll be able to do at

1204.44 --> 1209.419
least something on the surface which

1206.059 --> 1211.8799999999999
will probably help a lot

1209.419 --> 1214.76
if you're like kind of in standby

1211.88 --> 1217.5200000000002
waiting to receive

1214.76 --> 1220.16
and who knows maybe if you do it like if

1217.52 --> 1222.9189999999999
you stand by to receive like energy for

1220.16 --> 1225.6200000000001
restoration to climb out of it

1222.919 --> 1227.66
then maybe even just doing that and

1225.62 --> 1228.4399999999998
keeping focused and not panicking and

1227.66 --> 1231.679
not

1228.44 --> 1234.5
focusing on Doom might already

1231.679 --> 1238.52
give you an opportunity

1234.5 --> 1240.559
from the spirit world man some way

1238.52 --> 1243.74
on the other side

1240.559 --> 1245.6
without my healer right because there's

1243.74 --> 1247.4
a lot of things happening out there in

1245.6 --> 1249.98
the spirit world

1247.4 --> 1253.299
and yeah

1249.98 --> 1253.299
things respond to you

1254.48 --> 1259.48
it's not all dark things out there

1260.179 --> 1265.2800000000002
don't go try to actively look them up

1262.76 --> 1267.14
like let them do their thing you do your

1265.28 --> 1269.36
thing

1267.14 --> 1272.14
and when you do it right then things

1269.36 --> 1272.1399999999999
work out right

1273.2 --> 1275.98
anyway

1278.559 --> 1283.059
s they're mushrooms okay

1287.66 --> 1292.8400000000001
right yeah that yeah I know what that's

1290.539 --> 1292.84
like

1293.24 --> 1296.08
I've seen

1299.48 --> 1304.52
like really that's way in the past by

1302.12 --> 1307.1589999999999
the way but in the past

1304.52 --> 1309.86
where there was like

1307.159 --> 1312.6200000000001
family don't even remember what family

1309.86 --> 1315.1399999999999
that was but not my own

1312.62 --> 1318.08
and they had like a dinner Christmas

1315.14 --> 1321.0800000000002
dinner combined

1318.08 --> 1322.6399999999999
so on one hand there was a turkey and on

1321.08 --> 1324.799
the other there was also vegetarian

1322.64 --> 1327.2800000000002
stuffed indeed with like nut roast and

1324.799 --> 1338.9
mushrooms and all that

1327.28 --> 1340.1499999999999
[Music]

1338.9 --> 1344.709
all right

1340.15 --> 1344.709
[Music]

1349.1 --> 1352.1
foreign

1353.28 --> 1363.109
[Music]

1373.52 --> 1377.539
right anyway yeah my Christmas dinner

1376.52 --> 1381.4
was

1377.539 --> 1381.4
black sour chicken

1381.74 --> 1386.539
made by my dad very proficiently made I

1384.559 --> 1389.4189999999999
mean it was absolutely gorgeous and was

1386.539 --> 1392.24
also like this special chicken like

1389.419 --> 1393.7990000000002
Beyond Organic like from some fanatical

1392.24 --> 1397.1
farmer

1393.799 --> 1399.1399999999999
lady or something that like feeds her

1397.1 --> 1400.539
chicken like with like the best type of

1399.14 --> 1403.2800000000002
feed

1400.539 --> 1406.1589999999999
fanatically and you could taste it I

1403.28 --> 1409.1589999999999
mean it's it was gorgeous

1406.159 --> 1409.159
foreign

1409.39 --> 1413.419
[Music]

1410.679 --> 1415.299
part of it with delicious fat skin

1413.419 --> 1419.0800000000002
everything

1415.299 --> 1419.08
was off

1433.28 --> 1439.46
right and yes green beans and little

1437.12 --> 1441.9189999999999
Tutti Frutti which is typical you're

1439.46 --> 1444.6000000000001
supposed to have a little of that with

1441.919 --> 1446.0
black sour chicken and

1444.6 --> 1447.6789999999999
[Music]

1446.0 --> 1450.52
yeah some

1447.679 --> 1450.52
Rosemary

1451.1 --> 1454.0
potatoes

1455.419 --> 1458.14
great

1458.72 --> 1463.659
relatively simple but like really great

1481.039 --> 1486.08
oh I think people eat away too much food

1483.38 --> 1490.0590000000002
nowadays I don't know

1486.08 --> 1490.059
I don't know how much people eat

1491.9 --> 1497.3600000000001
but what I do know is that in my own

1494.9 --> 1499.159
experience once I started to eat organic

1497.36 --> 1501.62
and like

1499.159 --> 1504.6200000000001
not just oh I'll eat some organic with

1501.62 --> 1506.84
that no no just like when I thought okay

1504.62 --> 1509.0
I'm going to eat exclusively organic and

1506.84 --> 1512.48
that thereby also

1509.0 --> 1514.34
losing that freedom of oh you can walk

1512.48 --> 1516.26
into pretty much any supermarket and

1514.34 --> 1519.86
just oh they have everything you want

1516.26 --> 1522.919
right because you lose that then

1519.86 --> 1525.74
I chose to do that

1522.919 --> 1527.8400000000001
and after that I just noticed that okay

1525.74 --> 1530.9
since I started to adapt to a fully

1527.84 --> 1535.279
organic only diet

1530.9 --> 1537.14
I just started to eat less because

1535.279 --> 1541.22
yeah there's no

1537.14 --> 1543.919
weird chemicals or preservatives added

1541.22 --> 1546.22
like that already was such a big

1543.919 --> 1546.22
difference

1547.64 --> 1553.46
my taste completely transformed

1550.52 --> 1555.679
and then I stopped drinking like

1553.46 --> 1558.02
sodas all together like first it's like

1555.679 --> 1560.24
oh you could have another type of colon

1558.02 --> 1561.9189999999999
organic coal and I was like oh cool

1560.24 --> 1564.02
and it was actually like oh that's

1561.919 --> 1567.14
actually kind of nice but then

1564.02 --> 1569.299
eventually yeah I I still like

1567.14 --> 1570.74
all those things that I replaced first

1569.299 --> 1574.82
with Organic

1570.74 --> 1577.52
versions I just then eventually like no

1574.82 --> 1579.4399999999998
no I don't need that anymore

1577.52 --> 1582.2
for some reason like the original

1579.44 --> 1584.0
product had some addictive element that

1582.2 --> 1586.039
really kept you from taking it and it

1584.0 --> 1587.299
was the convenience

1586.039 --> 1592.419
but

1587.299 --> 1592.4189999999999
once I dropped that convenience factor

1592.58 --> 1598.059
it I just was able to discard it

1598.34 --> 1603.6299999999999
like I didn't long for it anymore

1601.52 --> 1605.96
starting with sodas

1603.63 --> 1607.5400000000002
[Music]

1605.96 --> 1612.95
right

1607.54 --> 1612.95
[Music]

1615.62 --> 1620.559
all right and and when you're just when

1618.14 --> 1624.26
you when you eat good nutritious stuff

1620.559 --> 1626.559
and good supplements that are actually

1624.26 --> 1630.3799999999999
nutritional

1626.559 --> 1632.96
then suddenly also just having a bit of

1630.38 --> 1637.179
hunger doesn't bring like a weird

1632.96 --> 1637.179
feeling of Despair with it

1639.559 --> 1643.76
because

1641.0 --> 1645.62
if I'd have to like reason it out

1643.76 --> 1649.46
like why

1645.62 --> 1651.799
why do people that like keep eating

1649.46 --> 1653.659
like why it's kind of known right in

1651.799 --> 1656.0
Psychology like typical eaters

1653.659 --> 1658.88
depression eaters or something

1656.0 --> 1660.74
they eat to suppress the feeling of

1658.88 --> 1662.3600000000001
Despair well where's that feeling of

1660.74 --> 1666.64
Despair coming from other than the

1662.36 --> 1666.6399999999999
psychological reinforcement I mean

1674.9 --> 1677.5
right

1678.14 --> 1682.88
I mean it seems logical that even

1680.12 --> 1685.2199999999998
somebody that would typically like

1682.88 --> 1687.6200000000001
overeat like that if they just

1685.22 --> 1692.3600000000001
transition to all organic

1687.62 --> 1695.539
that they would get a much easier handle

1692.36 --> 1698.799
on the psychological reinforcement right

1695.539 --> 1698.799
on letting it go

1699.08 --> 1702.46
then they slim down

1705.559 --> 1710.98
all right Brandon Cook

1707.6 --> 1710.98
you started with soda

1712.76 --> 1718.46
I started with transitioning to organic

1715.76 --> 1721.1
first red cook but then

1718.46 --> 1725.71
as I transitioned then I started

1721.1 --> 1728.1789999999999
dropping Habits Like sodas entirely

1725.71 --> 1730.039
[Music]

1728.179 --> 1734.679
right

1730.039 --> 1734.679
and then I only wanted filtered water

1735.02 --> 1738.1
no more tap water

1747.679 --> 1752.8400000000001
and then eventually also starting taking

1750.2 --> 1754.52
supplements starting with fish oil wow

1752.84 --> 1758.0
what a world of difference that was

1754.52 --> 1760.6399999999999
because I don't eat fish you see if I'd

1758.0 --> 1762.62
eat fish I'd probably would just eat

1760.64 --> 1764.3600000000001
fish regularly and I wouldn't really

1762.62 --> 1766.34
need fish oil

1764.36 --> 1769.7199999999998
or less of it

1766.34 --> 1769.72
because now I take it daily

1769.82 --> 1775.1
but that makes a huge difference on Just

1772.76 --> 1778.039
My overall

1775.1 --> 1780.08
ability range like how how much I could

1778.039 --> 1781.76
do

1780.08 --> 1784.46
in a moment

1781.76 --> 1786.919
that really changed that because before

1784.46 --> 1790.76
that it was just like

1786.919 --> 1793.159
closed off like like in depression not

1790.76 --> 1794.899
like actively destroying depression but

1793.159 --> 1797.8990000000001
it was just kind of blocking it off it

1794.899 --> 1798.6789999999999
just couldn't find the energy you could

1797.899 --> 1803.059
say

1798.679 --> 1805.279
facial change that and also made it it

1803.059 --> 1808.7
prevented me from falling into like

1805.279 --> 1810.919
really deep depression holes where you

1808.7 --> 1814.64
really collapse and like completely lose

1810.919 --> 1816.3200000000002
yourself and your sense of self-dignity

1814.64 --> 1818.72
because that happened a couple of times

1816.32 --> 1821.4189999999999
during my teens

1818.72 --> 1824.059
[Music]

1821.419 --> 1826.76
and I would be mostly the one to really

1824.059 --> 1830.24
be subjected to that because I was never

1826.76 --> 1833.86
like if I get depressed my reaction is I

1830.24 --> 1833.86
close off I hide

1833.98 --> 1840.9
to protect other people from because I'm

1837.559 --> 1844.46
afraid it'll rub off on that you see

1840.9 --> 1848.14
[Music]

1844.46 --> 1848.14
but fish oil changed that

1852.919 --> 1857.3600000000001
you want to try fish you haven't

1855.5 --> 1861.88
fibroids

1857.36 --> 1861.8799999999999
you you don't take any fish oil

1862.159 --> 1865.179
do you eat fish

1866.96 --> 1870.64
hello by the way good to see you

1872.779 --> 1877.039
they're sippy I don't know who that is

1875.059 --> 1879.2
DJ one deck

1877.039 --> 1881.14
don't need him oh

1879.2 --> 1883.76
well

1881.14 --> 1887.539
in that case my man

1883.76 --> 1889.1
I definitely recommend you try it make

1887.539 --> 1890.059
sure you get a really good quality

1889.1 --> 1892.279
though

1890.059 --> 1893.899
I mean especially the the first time

1892.279 --> 1896.659
you're gonna try it

1893.899 --> 1898.6399999999999
try not to think of your expenditure

1896.659 --> 1901.3400000000001
about it too much and really just try to

1898.64 --> 1905.0590000000002
go for the best thing that is within

1901.34 --> 1907.48
logical Financial range but good one I

1905.059 --> 1907.48
take

1907.7 --> 1913.3990000000001
this fish oil

1910.64 --> 1915.919
from Royal green which is there is there

1913.399 --> 1917.2399999999998
are cheaper ones like right next to it

1915.919 --> 1921.0200000000002
but

1917.24 --> 1923.6
I've tried those it's this one is the

1921.02 --> 1926.4189999999999
best out there that I can find

1923.6 --> 1928.6399999999999
although we like maybe Alex Jones's fish

1926.419 --> 1931.46
all is even better I don't know

1928.64 --> 1934.0590000000002
it could be I mean

1931.46 --> 1934.059
but

1934.58 --> 1941.4189999999999
yeah try it out man I mean

1937.82 --> 1945.52
I I kind of assumed you already took to

1941.419 --> 1945.5200000000002
me like it's so logical like oh

1945.86 --> 1949.58
you have mood swing issues or something

1948.08 --> 1952.899
or

1949.58 --> 1952.899
yeah fish oil

1958.22 --> 1962.659
I mean it is the ultimate brain support

1960.94 --> 1966.14
[Music]

1962.659 --> 1969.2
the oil in that is a big chunk of what

1966.14 --> 1971.5590000000002
your brain is material wise

1969.2 --> 1971.559
foreign

1980.32 --> 1986.21
[Music]

1986.96 --> 1991.64
well yeah it helps with any kind of

1989.72 --> 1993.5
mental state

1991.64 --> 1996.44
if you don't have it

1993.5 --> 1999.14
that is I mean if you just typically get

1996.44 --> 2000.7
those nutritions through your diet

1999.14 --> 2003.279
already

2000.7 --> 2005.74
then yeah then it might not make any

2003.279 --> 2008.2
difference but if you're like completely

2005.74 --> 2009.79
without it and you never realized that

2008.2 --> 2012.93
yeah definitely try it because

2009.79 --> 2012.93
[Music]

2012.94 --> 2018.7
to me it's like another part of you just

2016.0 --> 2020.44
like awakens and that you feel more

2018.7 --> 2022.98
complete

2020.44 --> 2022.98
so

[Music]

2029.76 --> 2039.1
yeah Brandon Cook just take it easy man

2034.779 --> 2041.38
and why don't you talk about flood I do

2039.1 --> 2043.799
talk about flareth as well just not

2041.38 --> 2043.7990000000002
right now

2056.2 --> 2059.58
yeah

2057.7 --> 2062.1389999999997
no

2059.58 --> 2064.379
I I don't know how to pronounce that

2062.139 --> 2064.379
name

2065.44 --> 2073.02
whatever it is but yeah no no I am going

2070.119 --> 2073.02
to take fish oil

2075.399 --> 2082.2999999999997
not walnuts or flaxseed

2079.72 --> 2086.2
I've I've tried it a bit

2082.3 --> 2088.8390000000004
with plants it doesn't work with me it

2086.2 --> 2091.3199999999997
might work great for others

2088.839 --> 2091.32
right

2099.76 --> 2107.0800000000004
I mean with me it's it's this weird Okay

2102.9 --> 2110.6800000000003
technically if I'd be deprived of these

2107.08 --> 2114.64
fish oil supplements for a while

2110.68 --> 2117.339
I'll start to get like hungry for fish

2114.64 --> 2118.72
which is really bizarre it's happened

2117.339 --> 2121.599
before

2118.72 --> 2124.4199999999996
because I despise it I really don't like

2121.599 --> 2127.7200000000003
the taste of it but I'll literally just

2124.42 --> 2130.48
start almost like I need that like I

2127.72 --> 2133.8999999999996
like ah get it in me I don't want to

2130.48 --> 2137.38
taste it but get it in me so

2133.9 --> 2137.9300000000003
do you burp that fish now barely and I

2137.38 --> 2141.1600000000003
don't really care

2137.93 --> 2141.16
[Music]

2143.14 --> 2148.2999999999997
I mean the smell of fish I mean yeah I

2146.079 --> 2150.82
don't really love it but I don't

2148.3 --> 2153.76
really detest it it doesn't make me sick

2150.82 --> 2156.76
or nauseous it's just the taste of it in

2153.76 --> 2159.5200000000004
my mouth I do not like

2156.76 --> 2162.5200000000004
lingers

2159.52 --> 2164.74
but the smell I don't care

2162.52 --> 2168.42
that doesn't linger except in the place

2164.74 --> 2168.4199999999996
well where the fish is

2169.0 --> 2172.66
doesn't come with you really unless you

2171.16 --> 2173.8199999999997
rub it off on your clothes or something

2172.66 --> 2175.2999999999997
but anyway

2173.82 --> 2177.82
[Music]

2175.3 --> 2181.6800000000003
fish oil works for me if you've never

2177.82 --> 2181.6800000000003
tried that definitely try it

2185.98 --> 2191.26
and

2187.9 --> 2193.859
while you're at it do use any kind of

2191.26 --> 2193.8590000000004
iodine

2197.68 --> 2201.94
because

2199.66 --> 2204.339
if you haven't if it's the same story

2201.94 --> 2206.2000000000003
well that would

2204.339 --> 2210.18
help

2206.2 --> 2210.18
because if you use iodine

2210.22 --> 2214.1189999999997
it will

2211.599 --> 2217.6800000000003
yeah it will help your pineal gland

2214.119 --> 2217.6800000000003
directly like that's provable

2217.96 --> 2222.88
it supports

2219.66 --> 2225.339
well if you have for example issue over

2222.88 --> 2227.2000000000003
your youth or like with fluoridated

2225.339 --> 2231.359
water or something or even through your

2227.2 --> 2234.3999999999996
toothpaste well sodium fluoride

2231.359 --> 2237.5789999999997
basically calcifies your pineal gland

2234.4 --> 2240.04
the numbing you down closing off your

2237.579 --> 2242.44
empathy and for some people turning them

2240.04 --> 2246.82
into zombies

2242.44 --> 2249.76
is like the poisoning effect of fluoride

2246.82 --> 2252.099
is the it calcifies your pineal gland

2249.76 --> 2255.3390000000004
literally because it literally turns it

2252.099 --> 2258.1600000000003
into a solid Crystal it's very weird but

2255.339 --> 2260.74
it can be decalcified

2258.16 --> 2264.22
by basically replacing

2260.74 --> 2266.04
the halogen type with the best one and

2264.22 --> 2269.02
that is iodine

2266.04 --> 2271.06
and any type of iodine would already do

2269.02 --> 2272.2599999999998
like you can get it from kelp from

2271.06 --> 2273.7599999999998
seaweed

2272.26 --> 2277.7200000000003
or

2273.76 --> 2281.619
well there's from raw mineral dug up

2277.72 --> 2283.8999999999996
pure iodine and and I've yeah that

2281.619 --> 2286.859
product I got to know through Alex Jones

2283.9 --> 2286.859
exclusively

2288.7 --> 2294.0989999999997
survival shoe next too but this is like

2292.3 --> 2296.5
the best thing I've ever come across

2294.099 --> 2298.1800000000003
when it comes to iodine I cannot imagine

2296.5 --> 2300.76
there being anything better out there

2298.18 --> 2303.66
than this seriously you might never ever

2300.76 --> 2303.6600000000003
come ever

2304.54 --> 2309.16
but

2306.42 --> 2312.16
I mean that stuff

2309.16 --> 2314.94
effectively or like raises your IQ IQ

2312.16 --> 2314.94
proofably

2318.46 --> 2323.44
anyway what about the toothpaste well

2321.04 --> 2326.64
don't take fluoridated toothpaste you

2323.44 --> 2326.64
absorb it with your gums

2328.24 --> 2332.5789999999997
generally what the [ __ ] is up with you

you out

2336.88 --> 2343.2000000000003
[ __ ] off you're a disrupter

2340.599 --> 2347.6400000000003
all you've done is try to insert

2343.2 --> 2347.64
disruptive words get the [ __ ] out

2350.44 --> 2354.07

2355.48 --> 2361.859
all right give it both a try

2358.3 --> 2361.8590000000004
start with the fish oil though

2374.32 --> 2379.2400000000002
I am a support

2376.54 --> 2382.2599999999998
Brandon Cook not talking to you I was

2379.24 --> 2382.2599999999998
talking to Gina Lee

2394.8 --> 2404.52
what do you think of this algorithm Army

2399.52 --> 2404.52
I think it's boring and a waste of time

2406.359 --> 2411.5789999999997
I mean there's even barely anything

2408.339 --> 2414.52
there to analyze

2411.579 --> 2418.8590000000004
I I mean I'd keep trolls around if they

2414.52 --> 2418.859
were actually funny or interesting

2419.2 --> 2427.68
if they'd use like real information to

2422.44 --> 2427.68
distract now that's smart trolling right

2428.859 --> 2434.859
but it's just dumb [ __ ] it's like oh

2431.5 --> 2437.44
let's forward all the stupid stereotype

2458.8 --> 2463.599
like review

2460.72 --> 2466.359
stupid anti-flat earthers negatively or

2463.599 --> 2470.82
anything I don't even do that I mean

2466.359 --> 2470.8199999999997
have you ever seen me do that

2476.02 --> 2480.579
I think I might have like once tried to

2478.359 --> 2483.16
do it for like two minutes and then it

2480.579 --> 2486.76
just like felt oh God I'm stuck I'm not

2483.16 --> 2489.8799999999997
doing this screw that

2486.76 --> 2494.1600000000003
because I just don't do that but they

2489.88 --> 2494.1600000000003
yeah they all keep coming over

2495.7 --> 2498.8999999999996
trying to poke me

2499.96 --> 2505.48
I mean I don't even

2501.76 --> 2509.579
talk about Flat Earth all the time

2505.48 --> 2509.579
yeah it's in the title every single time

2510.82 --> 2516.339
but yeah hey if Flat Earth comes up I'll

2514.3 --> 2519.6400000000003
talk about it

2516.339 --> 2522.339
but yeah people have other things in

2519.64 --> 2524.3199999999997
their lives than Flat Earth too like

2522.339 --> 2526.839
their own health

trying to get around

2529.0 --> 2536.099
psychologically

2531.52 --> 2536.099
so I talk about that a lot too

2543.52 --> 2546.119
huh

2549.88 --> 2555.82
you think Brandon Cook is an algorithm

2553.18 --> 2557.2
that would be weird because he's an old

2555.82 --> 2559.96
one

2557.2 --> 2563.2
if he's in there but

2559.96 --> 2565.839
I don't know I don't think he is

2563.2 --> 2567.64
Ben Cook's been around for a while I

2565.839 --> 2571.32
also banned him at some point I mean

2567.64 --> 2571.3199999999997
he's not a guy without issues

2572.8 --> 2578.38
but it's kind of like how I see a jam I

2575.68 --> 2581.2599999999998
mean ATM is a pretty good guy but he

2578.38 --> 2584.76
gets caught up in nonsense and he has

2581.26 --> 2584.76
Sylvania syndrome at times

2584.92 --> 2589.2400000000002
it doesn't mean that is I'm thinking

2587.079 --> 2592.119
he's an algorithm

2589.24 --> 2595.4199999999996
just means he's a guy with some issues

2592.119 --> 2599.1400000000003
Brandon Cook since he allows himself to

2595.42 --> 2601.359
get Delirious clearly has some issues at

2601.359 --> 2605.02
isolated incident because otherwise

2603.04 --> 2607.319
that's a pretty miserable way of going

2605.02 --> 2607.319
about

2609.16 --> 2612.839

2616.96 --> 2622.2

he's always had that picture

2646.66 --> 2651.8999999999996
it's part of the reason I recognize it's

2648.64 --> 2651.9

you're actually a projecting bot

yes

out like yeah that war is out there now

3017.88 --> 3020.7200000000003
what are you gonna do

3020.76 --> 3024.8
basically what side are you gonna take

3026.46 --> 3030.7400000000002
because you're gonna get caught up one

3028.2 --> 3030.74
way or the other

3039.619 --> 3047.52
just fight for Flat Earth subject

3042.9 --> 3049.319
excuse me but don't tell me what to do

3047.52 --> 3052.2
lady

3049.319 --> 3054.74
who just joined my stream

3052.2 --> 3059.04
that's first off you you

3054.74 --> 3060.2999999999997
should definitely know better than that

3059.04 --> 3062.339
right

3060.3 --> 3065.579
your newcomer

3062.339 --> 3067.5
and I don't like to be narrowed down to

3065.579 --> 3072.0
a singular subject thank you very much

3067.5 --> 3075.2
I'll be the judge and the determiner of

3072.0 --> 3075.2
what I do on my show

3077.88 --> 3082.38
if I want to talk about Flat Earth then

3080.22 --> 3084.359
I'm going to talk about Flat Earth if I

3082.38 --> 3086.04
don't want to talk about it

3084.359 --> 3087.96
because

3086.04 --> 3091.319
I don't know

3087.96 --> 3094.7400000000002
maybe I'm a little full of it you know I

3091.319 --> 3096.359
talk about it continually and I like I

3094.74 --> 3097.9799999999996
always I'm part of the flatter of

3096.359 --> 3100.74
debates

3097.98 --> 3104.359
I mean I'm getting a big dose of Flat

3100.74 --> 3104.359
Earth every day through that

3107.819 --> 3110.0
thank you

3110.04 --> 3115.44
and I'm just not the type to continually

3112.98 --> 3118.64
keep repeating myself like on a daily

3115.44 --> 3118.64
basis I hate that

3123.48 --> 3129.599
unless it's like my intro riddle because

3126.78 --> 3133.76
yeah that's something that I do exactly

3129.599 --> 3133.76
the same every time or I try to

3134.4 --> 3139.98
but not when it comes to subject I don't

3136.5 --> 3142.68
I don't want to be a tape recorder

3139.98 --> 3144.9
no matter how good the tape is

3142.68 --> 3148.0789999999997
don't want to just be a tape you keep

3144.9 --> 3150.3
playing over and over again

3148.079 --> 3154.1400000000003
that's a waste of my potential a lot of

3150.3 --> 3157.94
my Powers lie in

3154.14 --> 3157.94
in improvisation itself

3163.28 --> 3169.8590000000004
improvisation with what I got

3165.44 --> 3171.76
information energy anything

3169.859 --> 3178.969
people

3171.76 --> 3178.969
[Music]

3201.119 --> 3204.559
right so yeah

3209.339 --> 3212.7799999999997
oh Banks I guess

3216.599 --> 3221.3
where are you from

3218.28 --> 3221.3
if I may ask

3228.78 --> 3233.1600000000003
I mean like which

3231.48 --> 3236.18
Arabic

3233.16 --> 3236.18

Morocco wow okay

3255.42 --> 3261.119
interesting

3258.02 --> 3263.94
right and I heard a lot of people there

3261.119 --> 3268.819
like into Flat Earth or is this

3263.94 --> 3268.819
something you recently just rolled into

3268.98 --> 3273.42
or like

3271.26 --> 3275.7000000000003
how long have you been doing this so do

3273.42 --> 3280.16
you know the other guys like Eric de Bay

3275.7 --> 3283.68
and Mark Sergeant Nathan Oakley

3280.16 --> 3286.2599999999998
clubbusters probably heard of that

3283.68 --> 3289.68
so many others but I mean

3286.26 --> 3292.5
my Channel's been going since 2016.

3289.68 --> 3296.339
that's who I am doing a flat Earth early

3292.5 --> 3296.339
bird show number 1464.

3299.52 --> 3305.4
and others other channels have also been

3302.4 --> 3308.78
going for a long long time so when did

3305.4 --> 3308.78
you get on the ride

3312.72 --> 3316.68
and how

3314.4 --> 3319.28
if it's recent then how how did you roll

3316.68 --> 3319.2799999999997
into it

3319.319 --> 3325.14
did somebody tell you hey

3321.839 --> 3326.64
like a fellow Muslim or something talk

3325.14 --> 3328.5
about like that the Earth is actually

3326.64 --> 3330.7999999999997
flat and not a glow because I've heard

3328.5 --> 3330.8
that

3333.599 --> 3338.6400000000003
before all of them what are you talking

3336.54 --> 3341.24
about woman

3338.64 --> 3341.24
foreign

3356.599 --> 3361.8590000000004
yeah I know that

3359.28 --> 3362.73
but I'm not talking about that I'm

3361.859 --> 3364.38
talking about when

3362.73 --> 3367.079
[Music]

3364.38 --> 3370.619
when did you start getting involved with

3367.079 --> 3374.6600000000003
flat earthers online like myself

3370.619 --> 3374.6600000000003
you suddenly showing up

3376.74 --> 3384.9599999999996
that you get a YouTube recommendation

3379.74 --> 3388.319
did you do a search on flatter when why

3384.96 --> 3392.119
did somebody recommend you do that I

3388.319 --> 3392.119
want to know like how you arrived here

3400.26 --> 3404.76
search

3402.9 --> 3406.559
just now

3404.76 --> 3410.3
why

3406.559 --> 3410.3
what made you do that search

3410.7 --> 3415.859
who cares I care Brandon Cook dude

3418.38 --> 3423.98
I gave Muslims a bad name of the night

3420.78 --> 3423.98
yeah no [ __ ] Sherlock

3437.28 --> 3440.2400000000002
foreign

3466.619 --> 3472.1600000000003
okay so you're not gonna answer my

3469.559 --> 3472.1600000000003
question then

3472.5 --> 3477.859
thank you

3474.66 --> 3477.859
Moroccan lady

3478.14 --> 3485.46
oh

3480.76 --> 3487.5
[Music]

3485.46 --> 3488.68
what

3487.5 --> 3491.93
okay

3488.68 --> 3491.93
[Music]

3494.7 --> 3500.339
well in that case

3497.28 --> 3504.3
have yet checked out Nathan Oakley 1980

3500.339 --> 3507.359
channel the show that follows up mine

3504.3 --> 3509.46
because I don't know anybody that is

3507.359 --> 3512.22
basically more the tip of the Spear of

3509.46 --> 3515.099
fighting the globe

3512.22 --> 3517.5
and corruption in general among Flat

3515.099 --> 3520.7000000000003
Earth as well

3517.5 --> 3520.7
then Nathan Oakley

3521.24 --> 3524.3999999999996
[Music]

3529.559 --> 3535.28
if that makes you happy then you'll have

3532.44 --> 3535.28
a good time

3536.76 --> 3544.5
because I am not super aggressive with

3539.579 --> 3547.2000000000003
the globe I mean I am actually kind of a

3544.5 --> 3550.26
weirdo when it comes to that because I

3547.2 --> 3553.68
believe in the future with Duo cosmagana

3550.26 --> 3558.1400000000003
made with the Dual customers

3553.68 --> 3558.14
dual cosmology basically I believe that

3560.4 --> 3565.7400000000002
Flat Earth can be Declassified and the

3563.52 --> 3568.38
globe as a dream

3565.74 --> 3570.4799999999996
as a fictional medium storytelling

3568.38 --> 3574.26
medium can still be

3570.48 --> 3578.94
persisted in a better way and not just

3574.26 --> 3582.7990000000004
as a tool of Satan to corrupt everything

3578.94 --> 3582.799
like what the US is typically doing

3585.24 --> 3591.72
right and Russia with its space stuff is

3588.42 --> 3594.7200000000003
doing less it's not that bad it's not

3591.72 --> 3598.2799999999997
that corrupting comparative I mean not

3594.72 --> 3598.2799999999997
super gay and all that right

3599.099 --> 3605.579
good job you're keeping the fight going

3602.52 --> 3607.619
okay why

3605.579 --> 3611.2400000000002
why

3607.619 --> 3611.2400000000002
it's a weird motivation there

3616.079 --> 3620.4
I'm actually trying to stop the fight

3618.059 --> 3624.1800000000003
I'm trying to create peace

3620.4 --> 3626.64
in which the globe as a dream as a as a

3624.18 --> 3630.4199999999996
live piece of art

3626.64 --> 3632.46
that we all can share can continue on

3630.42 --> 3635.579
but people

3632.46 --> 3639.42
will be made much more clear

3635.579 --> 3641.579
and trained to know like to know the

3639.42 --> 3644.64
difference like this is the dream this

3641.579 --> 3646.319
is like the societal secular dream right

3644.64 --> 3648.839
this is outer space but it's nonsense

3646.319 --> 3650.94
it's a science fiction story but that's

3648.839 --> 3653.819
what we do we build that science fiction

3650.94 --> 3655.14
story like we build art

3653.819 --> 3660.319
right

3655.14 --> 3660.319
wow Flat Earth is definitely respected

3661.02 --> 3666.72
except if you're kind of a whiny bastard

3664.079 --> 3669.0
that constantly just tries to

3666.72 --> 3671.52
tell little kids like oh it's actually

3669.0 --> 3676.079
flat did you know they're lying to you

3671.52 --> 3679.14
uh because that is like super disruptive

3676.079 --> 3681.6600000000003
I'm against that I mean

3679.14 --> 3683.46
this other guy once again the other

3681.66 --> 3685.44
Nathan guy

3683.46 --> 3687.119
forgets last name

3685.44 --> 3688.92
there's some flat earthers out there

3687.119 --> 3691.6400000000003
that do that and that's just super

3688.92 --> 3691.64
disruptive

3692.04 --> 3695.24
doesn't help at all

3699.96 --> 3706.94
lies and Corruption on NASA right well I

3703.74 --> 3710.4199999999996
have more motivation to actually fight

3706.94 --> 3712.2000000000003
they're gay and trans

3710.42 --> 3717.559
agenda

3712.2 --> 3717.5589999999997
and their well mind distortion

3718.5 --> 3724.079
because

3719.78 --> 3726.299
technically you could do a theater it is

3724.079 --> 3729.599
a theatric piece right you do realize

3726.299 --> 3730.98
that of course NASA is all theater

3729.599 --> 3733.339
but yeah what can you do with the

3730.98 --> 3736.559
theater you can do that make everybody

3733.339 --> 3738.7799999999997
like subliminally program them to become

3736.559 --> 3740.7200000000003
gay and pro-trance and everything that's

3738.78 --> 3743.4
wrong and Pro

3740.72 --> 3746.2799999999997
pro-medical experiments or

3743.4 --> 3749.099
you could literally make it like a

3746.28 --> 3753.48
well a bit like

3749.099 --> 3757.319
Japanese uh anime sci-fi does which is

3753.48 --> 3760.46
like more glorified more like serious

3757.319 --> 3763.2
and like strong

3760.46 --> 3764.579
commendable feelings that are emphasized

3763.2 --> 3766.3799999999997
and

3764.579 --> 3768.78
and sometimes it gets a little weird and

3766.38 --> 3772.2200000000003
squirty but yeah I'm excluding that

3768.78 --> 3776.46
sector of what they do

3772.22 --> 3776.4599999999996
Ren cook dude

3778.76 --> 3784.099
one more time and you're out

3792.54 --> 3798.859
it's not my [ __ ] problem okay what

3794.7 --> 3798.859
what your sexual orientation is

3801.599 --> 3806.2200000000003
you know where I'm at

3804.119 --> 3808.5
you should know

3806.22 --> 3811.6189999999997
if that's what you are then keep it to

3808.5 --> 3815.359
your [ __ ] self or get the [ __ ] out

3811.619 --> 3815.359
okay I don't care

3825.66 --> 3830.42
all right

3827.7 --> 3830.4199999999996
uh

3832.2 --> 3838.2
right but you could do you could use

3834.42 --> 3840.42
NASA to really like get little kids like

3838.2 --> 3842.339
to actually believe

3840.42 --> 3844.38
they could be astronauts and then

3842.339 --> 3847.04
actually show them what it is really

3844.38 --> 3847.04
like to be

3847.619 --> 3850.7400000000002
awesome

3849.299 --> 3853.68
right

3850.74 --> 3855.299
which is like what now is done with

3853.68 --> 3857.7
movies and all that like they put

3855.299 --> 3859.2
characters there and well if it's a

3857.7 --> 3861.66
really good movie it's usually because

3859.2 --> 3863.46
an actor is playing a really awesome

3861.66 --> 3865.5589999999997
role

3863.46 --> 3868.26
that's like real

3865.559 --> 3870.48
well you can do that with the astronaut

3868.26 --> 3873.559
[ __ ] too it would become much more like

3870.48 --> 3873.559
space movies then

3875.819 --> 3879.839
but it yeah I don't know they're not

3878.04 --> 3881.819
doing it I don't know if they're like

3879.839 --> 3884.22
not allowed to do it I don't know

3881.819 --> 3886.38
technically why

3884.22 --> 3888.839
they're doing it like this like whether

3886.38 --> 3892.26
it was always corrupted or whether it

3888.839 --> 3894.0
became infected with Satanism that just

3892.26 --> 3895.559
trying to make everybody gay and all

3894.0 --> 3900.14
that

3895.559 --> 3900.1400000000003
I'm not sure I mean

3900.42 --> 3906.2000000000003
like they're really early NASA materials

3903.059 --> 3906.2000000000003
60s and all that

3908.28 --> 3913.3190000000004
if there was any like secret subliminal

3912.059 --> 3915.9
sex

3913.319 --> 3918.66
agenda in there then it was pretty much

3915.9 --> 3921.0
the Rockets themselves and all that

3918.66 --> 3923.52
because that remains of course like

3921.0 --> 3924.78
symbolic for that

3923.52 --> 3926.94
but

3924.78 --> 3929.7000000000003
it's not like everybody was just

3926.94 --> 3931.7400000000002
disgusting and like evil wizards trying

3929.7 --> 3934.02
to corrupt you which is what they are

3931.74 --> 3936.359
like now I mean these NASA people are

3934.02 --> 3941.0
just evil

3936.359 --> 3941.0
they're like creepy manipulators

3942.72 --> 3946.02
it doesn't have to be like that but it

3945.059 --> 3951.309
is now

3946.02 --> 3951.309
[Music]

3956.34 --> 3970.76
[Music]

3967.2 --> 3970.7599999999998
it's not like that

3974.9 --> 3980.96
manipulation and lies no yeah but that's

3977.819 --> 3980.96
what a theater is

3981.359 --> 3984.44
it's make believe

3985.44 --> 3989.2200000000003
so it is of course lies in that sense

3988.02 --> 3993.359
but

3989.22 --> 3996.5989999999997
it's a story I mean a fairy tale is

3993.359 --> 3999.299
satanic then by that standard

3996.599 --> 4001.599
what even if you preface it of not being

3999.299 --> 4001.599
real

4001.88 --> 4009.799
okay well in that case then yeah every

4005.68 --> 4013.3999999999996
movie it should say ahead of time this

4009.799 --> 4017.299
is not reality then

4013.4 --> 4021.02
I mean it's kind of general knowledge

4017.299 --> 4024.44
and even NASA in their own way do it in

4021.02 --> 4027.319
minor ways I mean they do

4024.44 --> 4030.26
right they do not say like oh this is a

identify that

seen many different sides of him he's

gay he just came out in some stupid

unban him when I unban everything in a

delirious

4589.4 --> 4594.139999999999

like my brother was a programmer

my older brother who basically did all

4693.739 --> 4698.12
that when I was a little kid and I

4696.02 --> 4699.5
figured out like what programming is how

4698.12 --> 4701.9
it works

4699.5 --> 4704.78
later I had friends that literally

4701.9 --> 4709.599999999999
programmed artificial intelligence and

4704.78 --> 4709.599999999999

everything about what that is and the

with people that work with social

4837.14 --> 4844.1
interaction programs and dude I

4841.88 --> 4846.92
I knew a guy who was actually my

4844.1 --> 4848.179
Dungeons and Dragons game master back in

4846.92 --> 4852.5
the day

4848.179 --> 4854.96
who was programming the Mars rover AI

4852.5 --> 4856.58
I'm not even joking and he thought it

4854.96 --> 4859.28
was real by the way

4856.58 --> 4862.82
but the program the system that he built

4859.28 --> 4865.179
that was real it was just not really on

4862.82 --> 4865.179
Mars

4875.719 --> 4883.179
oh so like yeah

4878.42 --> 4886.88
I mean just the interfacing program

4883.179 --> 4889.88
to like translate through models

4886.88 --> 4891.86
instructions to Machinery that's a very

4889.88 --> 4892.82
different type of programming compared

4891.86 --> 4895.46
to

4892.82 --> 4899.599999999999
actual algorithms

4895.46 --> 4902.2390000000005
with flow charts for communication which

4899.6 --> 4904.9400000000005
can get extremely complicated because

4902.239 --> 4907.159
people are extremely Dynamic it's very

4904.94 --> 4911.0
hard to make it natural

4907.159 --> 4913.699
in the interaction a very very hard lots

4911.0 --> 4916.54
and lots of work very tedious actually

4913.699 --> 4916.54
to do it right

4916.88 --> 4920.2390000000005
yeah

4918.02 --> 4923.719
I'm not a programmer but I know about

4920.239 --> 4927.799999999999
this [ __ ] yeah I know I don't have to be

4969.14 --> 4973.12
oh Jesus Tony with him

4977.9 --> 4984.86
yeah well those high-tech on like

4981.52 --> 4987.4400000000005
industrial state-of-the-art programs for

4984.86 --> 4989.0599999999995
yeah operating Machinery yeah those are

4987.44 --> 4991.46
freaking expensive

4989.06 --> 4994.820000000001
but as soon as something replaces them

4991.46 --> 4998.3
in being better then they're worth

4994.82 --> 5001.239
downgrade dramatically

4998.3 --> 5003.6990000000005
it yeah that's how I'm literally using

5001.239 --> 5005.678999999999
Photoshop 7 which is ancient but it

5003.699 --> 5007.0
works great I mean it works great for

5005.679 --> 5009.219
what I want to do

5007.0 --> 5013.6
but if you compare that to the newest

5009.219 --> 5016.12
then it's like just one little thing you

5013.6 --> 5017.9800000000005
can do with it with a giant amount of

5016.12 --> 5022.32
things compared to the newer one right

5017.98 --> 5022.32
that's why that is extremely expensive

5027.4 --> 5031.839999999999
I wouldn't even do it you can do so many

5029.8 --> 5032.7390000000005

5031.84 --> 5037.1990000000005

I've not even mastered the entire thing

I've tried a couple of things though

5039.34 --> 5042.99
it's pretty but I mean I'm very

satisfied with what I can do with it

5045.04 --> 5050.32
then again I'm not like an animator

know but I want this little special

5052.12 --> 5056.159
effect and that little special effect

5056.26 --> 5060.58
no you're not blocked again George

5058.06 --> 5063.219
Sanford what the [ __ ] is your issue

5060.58 --> 5066.239
just don't use blocked words

5063.219 --> 5066.2390000000005
it's very simple

5066.5 --> 5069.59
[Music]

5072.58 --> 5077.5
if you don't show up

5074.38 --> 5079.12
can mean only one thing you your used

5077.5 --> 5084.06
words

5079.12 --> 5084.0599999999995
that I block or that YouTube blocks

5085.42 --> 5090.219
but just for the record

5088.12 --> 5091.659
blocked words I'm not revealing all of

5090.219 --> 5095.38
them

5091.659 --> 5098.5599999999995
but the more General words that might

5095.38 --> 5100.6
cause your comment in my chat to be

5098.56 --> 5103.7390000000005
blocked

5100.6 --> 5103.7390000000005
would be

5104.199 --> 5110.98
let's see what I think where's the words

5106.96 --> 5112.08
yeah well the c word

5110.98 --> 5115.0
yeah

5112.08 --> 5118.44
I'm not even gonna say it out loud but

5115.0 --> 5118.44
you should know that

5118.719 --> 5124.179
only fans

5121.0 --> 5127.9
literally the word it's not I'm not

5124.179 --> 5130.06
allowing that ever it's [ __ ] up where

5127.9 --> 5132.219
pedo

5130.06 --> 5137.7390000000005
is man

5132.219 --> 5139.9
and yeah the word vax with an x i banned

5137.739 --> 5142.54
that one too

5139.9 --> 5146.699
so if you use that

5142.54 --> 5146.699
yeah it's gonna show up

5147.28 --> 5154.239
I don't care how how much of a how much

5150.219 --> 5156.82
you want that over generalized

5154.239 --> 5159.5199999999995
statement to keep rolling out of you I

5156.82 --> 5162.099999999999
don't care it's not gonna happen here

5159.52 --> 5163.120000000001
yeah everybody knows and I don't give a

5162.1 --> 5165.34
[ __ ]

5163.12 --> 5167.44
everybody knows about it if you don't

5165.34 --> 5170.159000000001
know then you're not going to be long

5167.44 --> 5170.159
for this world

5171.639 --> 5178.1990000000005
because if you don't know at this point

5173.32 --> 5178.199
it's too late in my opinion

5192.699 --> 5196.78
so as long as you don't use any of those

5194.92 --> 5200.1990000000005
words

5196.78 --> 5202.659
your comments will just show up normal

5200.199 --> 5206.5
so yeah that's for me an indication that

5202.659 --> 5211.32
you wanted to be annoying because people

5206.5 --> 5211.32
that bring those things up are annoying

5213.94 --> 5217.259999999999
the [ __ ] out of your [ __ ]

I guess the trolls are

5226.0 --> 5233.8
out from there Slumber again

5230.44 --> 5235.48
you know got away from their families so

5233.8 --> 5238.900000000001
they're now

5235.48 --> 5241.48
waiting to unleash their bitter

5238.9 --> 5244.42
pointless vengeance

5241.48 --> 5246.718999999999
more than ever before I bet seems so

5244.42 --> 5246.719
today

5247.36 --> 5252.219
some people out there probably

5249.6 --> 5254.76
rediscovered how much they actually hate

5252.219 --> 5254.76
themselves

5258.46 --> 5262.56
and yeah those people tend to come to me

5263.86 --> 5270.36
meet the end of the month quotas yeah

5266.5 --> 5270.36
yeah exactly hello seeking star water

5315.76 --> 5318.4800000000005
okay

5318.58 --> 5324.639
really big ass gray clouds coming over

5321.219 --> 5326.82
but the rain has actually seemed to stop

5324.639 --> 5326.82
foreign

5328.92 --> 5337.32
seems to have actually stopped

5333.04 --> 5337.32
this I hope it's gonna stay like that

5337.78 --> 5341.0599999999995
because I still have to go through all

5339.58 --> 5346.12
that later

5341.06 --> 5348.4800000000005
[Music]

5346.12 --> 5348.48
hey

5348.699 --> 5353.04
why are thing always gets caught up

5354.34 --> 5358.139
hey flatten the curve good see you

5377.02 --> 5387.46
um yeah she does doesn't she

[Music]

5388.0 --> 5390.179

5397.98 --> 5403.599999999999
style water always typically suddenly

5400.54 --> 5406.139
shows up right after I ban some trolls

5403.6 --> 5406.139
like she's

5406.179 --> 5411.78
like an old lady with the broom just

5408.28 --> 5411.78
like ah sweeping it

5412.84 --> 5417.2390000000005
after the trolls have been dislodged

5422.26 --> 5425.6990000000005
brightening up the place

5427.76 --> 5430.97
[Music]

5434.139 --> 5439.0
you were right about the verse mortar

5436.36 --> 5443.58
missing in bricks

5439.0 --> 5443.58
called it I called it

5446.62 --> 5450.96
because that happens a lot more than

5448.48 --> 5450.959999999999
you'd expect

5454.06 --> 5459.120000000001
but that's pretty that's that's amazing

5464.26 --> 5469.4800000000005
so they did actually worm themselves

5466.78 --> 5471.159
through they can do that I mean rats can

5469.48 --> 5474.28
get through and mice can get through

5471.159 --> 5476.5
like microscopic spaces but birds some

5474.28 --> 5477.699
birds especially

5476.5 --> 5479.679
well

5477.699 --> 5482.32
especially the smaller ones but I guess

5479.679 --> 5485.219
a lot of them can do that too if they

5482.32 --> 5485.219
really want to get in

5495.699 --> 5502.0599999999995
it's kind of essential for nesting in

5498.1 --> 5502.06
the wild too you know right

5504.219 --> 5508.2390000000005
but did any more get in

5506.56 --> 5510.76
or did you just

5508.239 --> 5513.699
yeah check

5510.76 --> 5516.54
just the entire wall to see if there was

5513.699 --> 5516.54
a hole after all

5537.76 --> 5545.56
turbo broom from Santa oh wow

5542.62 --> 5547.3
you did actually that's hilarious that's

5545.56 --> 5549.04
hilarious that I said that you came in

5547.3 --> 5552.0
with the broom

5549.04 --> 5552.0
I didn't know that

5559.179 --> 5563.92
I had to chase out like the white cat

5561.76 --> 5565.179
out of the house with a broom yesterday

5563.92 --> 5566.86
evening

5565.179 --> 5568.96
because that cat was just going

5566.86 --> 5572.259999999999
completely insane

5568.96 --> 5574.6
he just kept on like rolling around and

5572.26 --> 5576.58
clawing at everything just it wouldn't

5574.6 --> 5578.7390000000005
stop it was like hanging on the stairs

5576.58 --> 5580.6
and you think he'd fall off any second

5578.739 --> 5584.199
but he just wouldn't

5580.6 --> 5585.9400000000005
kept on crawling and

5584.199 --> 5588.099999999999
was like get the hell out of here

5585.94 --> 5590.5
creature you're just driving me like if

5588.1 --> 5593.320000000001
I tried to touch her immediately claws

5590.5 --> 5598.08
was a hit my thing

5593.32 --> 5598.08
so I literally had to broom that cat out

5604.78 --> 5610.239
I probably shouldn't have given it like

5607.78 --> 5613.0
a little piece of that

5610.239 --> 5616.44
black sour chicken I think probably went

5613.0 --> 5616.44
a little nuts because of that

5617.56 --> 5621.719
but I didn't have anything else to give

5619.54 --> 5621.719
it

5628.679 --> 5634.5
but you were joking oh

5631.9 --> 5634.5
okay

5648.3 --> 5652.900000000001
Workman punching hole for security

5650.86 --> 5655.5
camera cable oh

5652.9 --> 5655.5
okay

5656.86 --> 5659.46
hmm

5661.84 --> 5667.12
by the way yeah you could just make it

5664.719 --> 5670.0
into a nest too

5667.12 --> 5672.46
I mean technically

5670.0 --> 5674.44
yeah depends on what the location really

5672.46 --> 5676.36
is and if there's a lot of wiring might

5674.44 --> 5678.339999999999
not be all that handy

5676.36 --> 5682.5599999999995
but you could basically like turn it

5678.34 --> 5682.56
into a an indoor nest

5683.199 --> 5686.94
hey did my camera freeze

5707.38 --> 5713.1
but I mean yeah depend it all depends if

5710.199 --> 5713.099999999999
you want that

5715.239 --> 5719.62
right

5717.28 --> 5722.679
but I mean for a bird that's a real

5719.62 --> 5724.26
blessing to have like a a basically a

5722.679 --> 5729.0
nest

5724.26 --> 5729.0
that is partially heated

5732.76 --> 5738.04
and if you you could really take it far

5734.92 --> 5741.46
and even like like build them on purpose

5738.04 --> 5743.62
in your house just like have holes

5741.46 --> 5745.78
for small birds and even for bigger

5743.62 --> 5747.34
birds and then just build a nest on the

5745.78 --> 5750.4
other side

5747.34 --> 5752.8
you can have it in like a glass nasty

5750.4 --> 5754.659
even it would get kind of dirty though

5752.8 --> 5758.76
or

5754.659 --> 5758.759999999999
or completely closed off one

5758.8 --> 5761.8
and then you wouldn't notice on the

5760.84 --> 5764.7390000000005
inside

5761.8 --> 5766.96
right you could do all kinds of things

5764.739 --> 5768.759999999999
but it is about the heating that's where

5766.96 --> 5772.62
they that's why they come they're coming

5768.76 --> 5772.62
for the heating to Shelter From the coal

5776.08 --> 5782.32
or to find a potential nesting space

5779.98 --> 5786.0
because a hole in the wall or in a tree

5782.32 --> 5786.0
yeah that works for them

5786.8 --> 5796.35
[Music]

5800.56 --> 5804.96
right I'm gonna take a two minute break

5802.179 --> 5804.96

5912.82 --> 5916.12
don't care about the nesting yeah as

5914.44 --> 5919.239
long as they don't flap around and

5916.12 --> 5922.84
create a Ruckus

5919.239 --> 5924.5199999999995
and you have cats of course I get it and

5922.84 --> 5926.8
that's gonna be

5924.52 --> 5929.400000000001
a mess potentially

5926.8 --> 5929.400000000001
foreign

5958.9 --> 5964.96
Hmm this is looking good

5963.24 --> 5968.92
[Music]

5964.96 --> 5972.52
brightening up more oh more still big

5968.92 --> 5976.06
clouds but they're less gray now

5972.52 --> 5978.650000000001
anyway yeah the show is coming to an end

5976.06 --> 5981.88
what am I gonna call this thing

5978.65 --> 5981.879999999999

his little food tip fish oil and iodine

6029.88 --> 6034.86
for the winter dip

6031.92 --> 6037.58
I think it's something that means we did

6034.86 --> 6037.58
talk about that

6038.4 --> 6043.5199999999995
the rest was just but just social

6040.139 --> 6043.52
interactions and all that

6046.68 --> 6051.56
[Music]

6049.02 --> 6051.56
oh

6072.32 --> 6080.759999999999
think the show might be Bev orientated

6078.3 --> 6083.76
on the flatters debates today

6080.76 --> 6086.76
you said more more stupid [ __ ] it just

6083.76 --> 6089.159000000001
keeps on getting worse and worse

6086.76 --> 6093.06
I mean Bev might turn out to be like the

6089.159 --> 6095.339999999999
worst anti-flatter of them all

6093.06 --> 6099.6
because it doesn't seem to have any

6095.34 --> 6101.9400000000005
limit as to how deep he sinks

6099.6 --> 6103.9800000000005
I mean that guy effectively knows no

6101.94 --> 6109.219
shame I think he might actually

6103.98 --> 6109.218999999999
literally not have that sensation at all

6114.719 --> 6117.44
anyway

6118.56 --> 6123.860000000001
a brief history in how not to troll

6124.679 --> 6128.96
yeah but that's not very positive

6130.76 --> 6136.08
besides I mean

6133.56 --> 6139.38
telling how not to troll is exactly

6136.08 --> 6142.92
gonna give them pointers on how to draw

6139.38 --> 6146.179
so I don't want to really do that it's

6142.92 --> 6146.179
probably gonna make it worse

6147.179 --> 6155.28
it's better to put positive titles

6151.76 --> 6157.8
instead of disapproving or negative

6155.28 --> 6160.199
titles because yeah when you do that

6157.8 --> 6163.38
people respond to it the other way

6160.199 --> 6163.379999999999
around typically

6176.84 --> 6183.4400000000005
I could say maybe trolls awaken from

6180.239 --> 6183.44
their Christmas slumber

6184.02 --> 6188.76
that might be a funny one

6187.56 --> 6192.619000000001
yeah

6188.76 --> 6192.619000000001
May let's see if that fits

6194.58 --> 6202.28
[Music]

6198.54 --> 6202.28
nah Christmas doesn't fit

6211.12 --> 6215.699
[Music]

6213.659 --> 6218.96
the pros awakened from their Slumber

6215.699 --> 6218.96
I'll just keep it like that

6219.719 --> 6222.26
foreign

6234.96 --> 6238.7390000000005
that's hilarious but I don't know if

6237.0 --> 6241.739
they actually get paid

6238.739 --> 6244.799999999999
maybe they get paid by the demons that

6241.739 --> 6247.619
push them to do that

6244.8 --> 6248.639
they maybe they get paid out in internal

6247.619 --> 6250.0199999999995
squirt

6248.639 --> 6252.2390000000005
right

6250.02 --> 6255.900000000001
it's like oh if you do this continually

6252.239 --> 6257.839999999999
I'll guarantee at least five to fifteen

6255.9 --> 6259.86
percent squared

6257.84 --> 6262.7390000000005
[Music]

6259.86 --> 6266.88
because that's that's a way you could

6262.739 --> 6270.119
talk about like demon economy

6266.88 --> 6274.5
they they're

6270.119 --> 6277.86
payment system is in square

6274.5 --> 6280.02
and getting off on something in the joy

6277.86 --> 6283.58
the temporary Joy of something the drug

6280.02 --> 6283.580000000001
of the moment whatever it is

6284.84 --> 6290.54
so they provide a service in squirt

6293.94 --> 6296.36
anyway

6303.42 --> 6309.84
but we shouldn't

6306.3 --> 6312.719
linger talking about trolls because they

6309.84 --> 6315.360000000001
will give them the false impression that

6312.719 --> 6318.32
the internet is all about them when it

6315.36 --> 6318.32
clearly isn't

6320.76 --> 6327.119000000001

6364.08 --> 6368.84
Genie

6366.0 --> 6368.84
desert

6369.84 --> 6373.4490000000005
[Music]

6375.239 --> 6377.959999999999
whatever

6378.78 --> 6383.4
thanks everyone did my freaking camera

6381.6 --> 6386.179
freeze again

6383.4 --> 6386.179
really

6388.679 --> 6392.639
seen me on all the shows okay well what

6391.02 --> 6395.179
do you don't what what is it about it

6392.639 --> 6395.179
you don't understand

6407.4 --> 6412.699
I do a show every day it's called The

6409.5 --> 6412.699
Flat Earth early bird show

6415.679 --> 6420.9800000000005
I can't tell what the main message is

6418.139 --> 6420.9800000000005
you can't

6421.38 --> 6424.639
the main message is

6424.86 --> 6427.88
do your best

6430.26 --> 6435.119000000001
and I don't know there's a lot of

6432.42 --> 6438.84
messages but the main message it's like

6435.119 --> 6442.44
I'm not a OneNote kind of guy

6438.84 --> 6444.84
I have a lot of different things

6442.44 --> 6447.119
that I do and that I stand for and that

6444.84 --> 6450.179
I have been rolling out

6447.119 --> 6452.699
different ideas that are that do have

6450.179 --> 6456.719
cohesion together

6452.699 --> 6459.48
I have methods very open

6456.719 --> 6462.06
like one of my main principles is that

6459.48 --> 6464.58
I'm extremely open and honest like

6462.06 --> 6467.219
there's nothing

6464.58 --> 6471.96
I I hold back

6467.219 --> 6474.119
for secret occult exploitation

6471.96 --> 6476.28
I only hold back because I think like

6474.119 --> 6477.9
it's just going to be destructive or

6476.28 --> 6480.3
unproductive

6477.9 --> 6482.219
but never because I want to keep some

6480.3 --> 6485.820000000001
secret to myself

6482.219 --> 6488.36
and so I'm extremely detailed in what I

6485.82 --> 6488.36
put down

6489.119 --> 6494.299999999999
so honesty is one of the main factors

6501.119 --> 6507.78
right also I'm not as much about

6503.9 --> 6510.78
attacked a lie no just know what it is

6507.78 --> 6512.639
like know what evil is that evil is a

6510.78 --> 6516.199
mistake

6512.639 --> 6516.1990000000005
and what happens with that

6518.639 --> 6522.56
are you a philosopher a teacher

6522.96 --> 6528.54
well

6525.54 --> 6531.86
I'm a Layman

6528.54 --> 6535.44
I don't have any papers I don't have any

6531.86 --> 6536.88
graduation paper [ __ ] except for while

6535.44 --> 6539.879999999999
my

6536.88 --> 6541.92
diplomas I mean did go to school I did

6539.88 --> 6545.04
do pretty well

6541.92 --> 6547.08
never finished like any continuation

6545.04 --> 6548.699
education because none of it actually

6547.08 --> 6550.679
turned out to be anything that I could

6548.699 --> 6553.739
do something with

6550.679 --> 6557.34
tried like healthcare

6553.739 --> 6559.619
I tried programming a bit

6557.34 --> 6561.84
I tried art

6559.619 --> 6565.08
like direct art

6561.84 --> 6567.679
and all of that just rejected me or it

6565.08 --> 6567.679
didn't work out

6568.44 --> 6575.78
so I'm just doing what I've always done

6573.0 --> 6579.42
apply the Socratic method

6575.78 --> 6582.239
be basically neurotically

6579.42 --> 6584.54
dedicated to doing things the way that I

6582.239 --> 6584.54
do them

6587.46 --> 6592.9800000000005
so yeah I definitely think that I would

6590.04 --> 6596.1
fall under teacher

6592.98 --> 6599.58
but not by any official registry I just

6596.1 --> 6603.54
teach is what I do everybody that's ever

6599.58 --> 6606.239
met me and has been my friend knows that

6603.54 --> 6608.82
I am compulsive about that

6606.239 --> 6609.839999999999
that I'm all yeah almost artistic about

6608.82 --> 6613.38
it like

6609.84 --> 6616.1990000000005
I do kind of use my teacher method

6613.38 --> 6618.54
to also hide

6616.199 --> 6621.719
in a social way I do that

6618.54 --> 6626.04
I've always done that

6621.719 --> 6629.04
I just I just like to teach why because

6626.04 --> 6632.219
I can't stand how stupid people are

6629.04 --> 6634.08
and that stupidity is not just because

6632.219 --> 6636.199
they can't learn it's also because they

6634.08 --> 6639.719
just never had the opportunity or never

6636.199 --> 6641.04
realized the will you need to actually

6639.719 --> 6644.4
get there

6641.04 --> 6647.34
so they can do it they just refuse or

6644.4 --> 6649.5599999999995
they haven't gotten to it

6647.34 --> 6651.900000000001
and that's the only way I can make this

6649.56 --> 6655.5
world world more bearable

6651.9 --> 6657.48
to myself so it's like I teach as a

6655.5 --> 6660.6
survival mechanism

6657.48 --> 6664.28
to make the world more bearable for me

6660.6 --> 6664.280000000001
because I hate ignorance

6665.34 --> 6671.1
like actually hate it and it's not just

6667.38 --> 6673.7390000000005
what is deemed or declared to be ignored

6671.1 --> 6676.7390000000005
no literally the spiritual effect of it

6673.739 --> 6678.119
I am repulsed by it I hate it it makes

6676.739 --> 6681.178999999999
me aggressive

6678.119 --> 6684.0599999999995
when people reinforce

6681.179 --> 6687.659
ignorance

6684.06 --> 6689.1
the effect of it the disengagement of

6687.659 --> 6692.099999999999
inquiry

6689.1 --> 6694.58
the stifling of the Socratic method I

6692.1 --> 6694.58
hate it

6695.1 --> 6699.4800000000005
right so I'm a lot of things I do a lot

6697.679 --> 6701.159
of things and

6699.48 --> 6704.759999999999
that's what it is

6701.159 --> 6706.92
right the part of my thing is that yeah

6704.76 --> 6708.900000000001
I am kind of hard to figure out

6706.92 --> 6711.56
you're gonna have to get to know me to

6708.9 --> 6711.5599999999995
figure me out

6716.94 --> 6721.678999999999
yeah Genie yeah pretty much not seeing

6720.6 --> 6724.5
through the veils meant to hide

6721.679 --> 6726.659
spiritual truth that's definitely a good

6724.5 --> 6729.48
way to say that right anyway I'm

6726.659 --> 6731.759999999999
