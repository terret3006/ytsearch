147.959 --> 150.959
mm-hmm

153.18 --> 159.62
hello Gadget inspector first in chat

155.64 --> 159.61999999999998
indeed PGC net

161.7 --> 167.04
how are you both doing

164.04 --> 168.42

Wednesday

190.379 --> 194.06
it's gonna be one of those days again

210.72 --> 213.9
right so I did get a PayPal from Rick

212.94 --> 216.42
back

213.9 --> 218.84
yesterday evening thank you for that

216.42 --> 218.83999999999997
work back

253.56 --> 258.239
right

255.239 --> 260.16
so yeah I had a very long sleep today

258.239 --> 262.67999999999995
and went to bed pretty early and then

260.16 --> 265.5
like woke up very early again

262.68 --> 270.02
then went back to bed

265.5 --> 270.02
and just had like this really

270.36 --> 276.66
great second sleep

273.66 --> 279.78000000000003
so but I feel a bit like

276.66 --> 284.54
a bit dreamy right now

279.78 --> 284.53999999999996
it's nice nice and relaxing for a change

288.479 --> 293.96
uh

291.24 --> 293.96000000000004
let's see

294.0 --> 298.4
yeah Flat Earth debate it's great

304.58 --> 310.74
again I don't remember

308.16 --> 312.96000000000004
I didn't I don't remember exactly what

310.74 --> 315.6
it was but I did know I was making a

312.96 --> 317.09999999999997
bunch of hassle even in the Live

315.6 --> 319.08000000000004
recorded show

317.1 --> 320.84000000000003
about something what was it again I

319.08 --> 322.32
don't know somebody refreshed my mind

320.84 --> 324.419
[Music]

322.32 --> 327.02
my memory I mean

324.419 --> 327.02
uh

346.32 --> 351.979
any feedback from you guys about like

349.02 --> 351.979
the Akira movie

352.32 --> 357.36
don't know if any of you have watched it

354.3 --> 359.94
it is extremely intense so I don't

357.36 --> 363.0
necessarily recommend it unless you're

359.94 --> 365.71999999999997
up for a real challenge

363.0 --> 365.72
uh

365.94 --> 371.0
holographic Sun yeah low Bundy bear

375.84 --> 383.46
they push it in the media oh

379.919 --> 385.68
right speed DJ pjc net

383.46 --> 387.29999999999995
I bet they do I don't even watch like

385.68 --> 391.1
the new

387.3 --> 391.1
but yeah sure they're gonna do that

391.44 --> 397.5
they don't realize that this has pretty

393.66 --> 401.47900000000004
much been one of the better type Summers

397.5 --> 401.479
or at least here it has been

403.74 --> 409.08
you know media at this point is just

406.62 --> 411.24
trying to fool everybody in being scared

409.08 --> 413.43
of their own shadow it really comes down

411.24 --> 416.619
to that

413.43 --> 416.619
[Music]

418.139 --> 423.24
for 1988 yeah

420.479 --> 425.52
yeah I know

423.24 --> 427.979
that's it but it's not even just the

425.52 --> 430.85999999999996
animation I think though I think the

427.979 --> 433.08
whole thing just the attention to detail

430.86 --> 435.47900000000004
the way they

433.08 --> 438.479
like how much they took like facial

435.479 --> 441.71999999999997
expression serious like it is

438.479 --> 445.919
it is still like this anime

441.72 --> 448.68
but it's like half anime half real it's

445.919 --> 452.479
it's quite unique I've never seen any

448.68 --> 452.479
other thing out there

452.759 --> 457.16
that was basically like this

458.039 --> 463.86
and the story guys like the story and

460.979 --> 465.3
how it progresses it is like a chart it

463.86 --> 468.97900000000004
is a chart

465.3 --> 468.979
specifically about like

469.8 --> 475.379
a metaphorical chart of power corruption

472.86 --> 478.5
what happens

475.379 --> 481.91900000000004
like tetsuo to me is like

478.5 --> 484.08
in a way the Ultimate Nightmare

481.919 --> 485.81899999999996
it should be quite obvious why and

484.08 --> 487.5
that's also part of the reason why I

485.819 --> 489.84000000000003
think it's like the scariest movie I've

487.5 --> 492.36
ever seen

489.84 --> 494.63899999999995
because this guy is like obviously

492.36 --> 498.3
having all this freaking ego issue

494.639 --> 501.3
self-worth issues he's he's grown up in

498.3 --> 503.34000000000003
a [ __ ] up world as an orphan bullied

501.3 --> 507.74
all the time

503.34 --> 507.73999999999995
so he's just like super defensive

508.379 --> 516.3000000000001
with a little heart very little

512.159 --> 519.899
right very egotistical and Escapist in

516.3 --> 524.5799999999999
nature and then he just gets told you

519.899 --> 527.58
you gotta realize this like he is

524.58 --> 530.1
he didn't choose to get that

527.58 --> 531.48
they just did it to him they're just

530.1 --> 534.12
like oh we're curious oh look what

531.48 --> 537.0600000000001
happened oh let's just do it right they

534.12 --> 539.3
don't even address it they just do it do

537.06 --> 539.3
it

543.06 --> 546.1999999999999
so he is like

547.86 --> 553.32
almost innocent while being given like

550.68 --> 556.56
this unbelievable power

553.32 --> 558.9590000000001
and they take it way too far immediately

556.56 --> 562.6199999999999
and it's just a complete it's a full bar

558.959 --> 564.7199999999999
experiment right and that's who is just

562.62 --> 567.12
like an innocence

564.72 --> 570.0
torture victim

567.12 --> 573.36
and he just completely loses his mind in

570.0 --> 575.88
the entire thing like and you could the

573.36 --> 578.82
Expressions on his face everything they

575.88 --> 582.38
put so much attention to it

578.82 --> 582.38
and it's really scary

582.899 --> 585.38
yeah

585.48 --> 591.98
all right

587.399 --> 591.98
but yeah just just like the motorcycle

592.019 --> 598.62
action scene at the start alone is just

595.019 --> 602.18
like whoa dude

598.62 --> 602.18
now that's action

605.04 --> 608.459
uh

606.36 --> 610.38
right but still the bells are still

608.459 --> 613.16
echoing

610.38 --> 613.16
in my head

624.779 --> 630.18
right I'm still not getting a good

627.48 --> 631.26
bearing on this situation with Abe as

630.18 --> 633.7199999999999
well

631.26 --> 635.22
apparently he was Trump's friend or

633.72 --> 638.22
something

635.22 --> 641.1
but he was also a world economic Forum

638.22 --> 643.6800000000001
participant

641.1 --> 645.779
so

643.68 --> 650.0
I still don't exactly know what to make

645.779 --> 650.0
of it like in The Wider context

662.64 --> 667.86
uh having a tooth well when I forget

665.459 --> 669.3
toothache is definitely not the time to

667.86 --> 671.279
watch this movie because it's gonna

669.3 --> 673.5
overload you with

671.279 --> 676.279
Darkness

673.5 --> 676.279
so

679.079 --> 684.779
right in that sort of situation I I'd

681.959 --> 687.1199999999999
rather recommend you just you just watch

684.779 --> 690.2
blueberry or something it's much better

687.12 --> 690.2
for that type of

691.26 --> 696.899
situation

693.36 --> 699.62
uh much more smooth not so much Darkness

696.899 --> 699.62
piling on

707.72 --> 713.5790000000001
the Holograms or what

711.48 --> 714.3000000000001
that was that the other day yeah I don't

713.579 --> 717.7399999999999
know

714.3 --> 717.74
I don't remember this

722.76 --> 727.98
there was one time where that was like

725.579 --> 731.279
earlier in the week

727.98 --> 732.899
where Adam brought up looping and he'd

731.279 --> 734.459
said it in a funny way and then I

732.899 --> 736.32
thought it was like he was trying to

734.459 --> 739.0189999999999
mock my looping

736.32 --> 741.3000000000001
so I got a bit pissed off but then

739.019 --> 742.5600000000001
realized like oh he was actually trying

741.3 --> 745.68
to make a joke

742.56 --> 748.079
that's not the time I'm talking

745.68 --> 751.5
it was just

748.079 --> 753.42
I just declared like no it's looping

751.5 --> 755.959
or was no it was the holographic Sun

753.42 --> 755.959
this time

757.019 --> 760.98
that's the thing I brought up I think

758.7 --> 763.44
that was yesterday

760.98 --> 768.019
when like the question the housekeeping

763.44 --> 768.019
question came up distance to the Sun

774.0 --> 776.54
right

777.0 --> 781.019
but I don't know

778.92 --> 782.8389999999999
like it's weird every time I bring it up

781.019 --> 786.24
there everybody's just like oh

782.839 --> 788.399
disapproving like what

786.24 --> 789.9590000000001
I don't even understand necessarily why

788.399 --> 792.06
it's like

789.959 --> 794.88
dude none of them actually understand

792.06 --> 796.8
what it even is I'm saying

794.88 --> 799.639
because if they do then they should

796.8 --> 801.8389999999999
realize like yeah it is

799.639 --> 804.48
unfortunately not all that

801.839 --> 807.36
straightforward

804.48 --> 809.279
but it is it really is a realistic

807.36 --> 814.399
Insight I really do believe the

809.279 --> 814.399
celestial lights are non-local Holograms

817.56 --> 823.5
all right non well non-physical object

820.56 --> 826.1389999999999
is a contradiction in terms really it's

823.5 --> 830.12
just it's non-physical

826.139 --> 832.86
and it's a hologram like based image

830.12 --> 834.48
literal but it's very specifically

832.86 --> 836.6990000000001
non-local

834.48 --> 839.04
because a local hologram is something

836.699 --> 841.4399999999999
you could make with the device and then

839.04 --> 843.54
you'd have an apparent image that even

841.44 --> 847.1990000000001
was subjectable to perspective that

843.54 --> 849.36
would adhere to The Observer to be in a

847.199 --> 851.279
specific location right

849.36 --> 853.32
and then you move up to it and then yeah

851.279 --> 857.459
it's angular size increases because you

853.32 --> 861.779
approach the point in space of a parent

857.459 --> 865.26
of its apparent origin or it's Epic

861.779 --> 867.6
uh its apparent position so that's a

865.26 --> 871.139
local hologram that's like technology we

867.6 --> 873.24
can make right well the celestials are

871.139 --> 876.3
not like that they're non-local so they

873.24 --> 878.279
are always just at an angle that's like

876.3 --> 880.88
the Hologram is that they are only

878.279 --> 880.88
angular

881.579 --> 884.2399999999999
like that

886.44 --> 890.639
but yeah I am trying to emphasize more

888.779 --> 892.92
and more the difference between local

890.639 --> 895.92
and non-local holograph because it is

892.92 --> 898.139
like it's a world of difference pun

895.92 --> 900.26
intended

898.139 --> 900.26
yeah

900.899 --> 906.18
oh Susie yes

903.139 --> 911.339
the blessed

906.18 --> 914.12
and fiber oats of course from earlier

911.339 --> 914.12
uh

923.8 --> 926.9699999999999
[Music]

936.24 --> 941.149
foreign

937.95 --> 941.149
[Music]

951.98 --> 957.12
one thing that really stands out to me

954.42 --> 959.279
is that nobody's nobody out there that

957.12 --> 961.5600000000001
I've seen is actually trying to address

959.279 --> 962.88
the concept

961.56 --> 964.8
like

962.88 --> 966.959
the only reason I can think of is

964.8 --> 970.199
they're either too scared of it or they

966.959 --> 971.8199999999999
just really don't get it

970.199 --> 975.7199999999999
like yeah

971.82 --> 978.0600000000001
is it that hard to just say and show

975.72 --> 979.38
that's a non-local hologram I think that

978.06 --> 982.2589999999999
even

979.38 --> 984.12
what's his name again lost souls that

982.259 --> 988.38
guy

984.12 --> 993.36
no wait I've lost souls uh

988.38 --> 995.279
the guy with this weird warped Earth

993.36 --> 997.32
awakened Souls

995.279 --> 999.8389999999999
yeah that wasn't

997.32 --> 1000.9200000000001
like I think he is like the only one

999.839 --> 1004.6990000000001
that

1000.92 --> 1006.62
even seems to be getting close to what

1004.699 --> 1008.66
I'm understanding about it

1006.62 --> 1011.0600000000001
like at least he's attempting it the

1008.66 --> 1013.04
rest just not doing it they're all just

1011.06 --> 1015.9799999999999
sitting on the

1013.04 --> 1018.5
standard disc Flat Earth model versus

1015.98 --> 1022.339
the globe and just like oh see we're

1018.5 --> 1024.799
better we're much more logical yeah it's

1022.339 --> 1027.22
like that's the only thing they could do

1024.799 --> 1027.22
or something

1027.439 --> 1032.0790000000002
do Holograms need a projector

1034.22 --> 1037.4
that depends on the nature of the

1036.439 --> 1039.679
hologram

1037.4 --> 1043.0
if it is like an image that is being

1039.679 --> 1043.0
inserted in space

1045.799 --> 1050.84
but the nature of the non-local Hologram

1049.039 --> 1053.0
of the celestial light might be a lot

1050.84 --> 1057.1399999999999
more complex than that I personally

1053.0 --> 1060.559
think it's a signature just off

1057.14 --> 1064.0590000000002
the space itself

1060.559 --> 1064.059
it's like built in

1064.46 --> 1069.559
it's just something that manifests it's

1067.16 --> 1072.2
like a hologram that's onto it's almost

1069.559 --> 1074.6
like a watermark

1072.2 --> 1076.3400000000001
of the realm

1074.6 --> 1079.0
I think that would be a pretty good

1076.34 --> 1079.0
comparison

1086.78 --> 1092.44
it's just in here it's part of this

1090.14 --> 1092.44
space

1095.66 --> 1101.38
need a energy source well the energy

1098.48 --> 1101.38
plenty

1117.02 --> 1120.02
foreign

1122.0 --> 1125.0
clutch

1127.48 --> 1133.1
what is it the first

1130.58 --> 1135.76
imagine that first made me think it was

1133.1 --> 1135.76
holographic

1136.24 --> 1142.82
uh actually the debates between flat

1140.24 --> 1144.559
earthers and globers about the path of

1142.82 --> 1146.539
the sun

1144.559 --> 1148.94
and how the Glovers would point out like

1146.539 --> 1151.22
oh wait but the angular speed doesn't

1148.94 --> 1154.46
decrease which is what you would see if

1151.22 --> 1156.08
it was actually an object moving over a

1154.46 --> 1158.24
disk it would move into the distance

1156.08 --> 1159.86
like perspective it would slow down yeah

1158.24 --> 1162.02
in the beginning there were glowers that

1159.86 --> 1165.9189999999999
were actually making that argument it

1162.02 --> 1167.84
was like yeah yeah they're right they're

1165.919 --> 1170.7800000000002
just not right because of the reason

1167.84 --> 1173.12
that they think they're right but they

1170.78 --> 1175.039
are correct in their perception and then

1173.12 --> 1178.36
I started saying as like yeah that's

1175.039 --> 1178.36
because it's holographic

1179.059 --> 1184.94
it's a it's a sphere

1181.94 --> 1187.16
that only is like a sphere to The

1184.94 --> 1190.94
Observer it's not actually there and

1187.16 --> 1193.94
everybody shares the same type of

1190.94 --> 1195.799
sight of it

1193.94 --> 1198.26
but it's always just moving at a

1195.799 --> 1200.4189999999999
consistent angular speed

1198.26 --> 1202.82
not because it's a giant ball of fire

1200.419 --> 1205.5800000000002
that surrounds a ball of dirt that we're

1202.82 --> 1207.799
standing on and and it we're rotating

1205.58 --> 1211.8799999999999
underneath that

1207.799 --> 1214.6399999999999
but because it's like us yeah

1211.88 --> 1217.64
like it

1214.64 --> 1221.7800000000002
a light image that just circles around

1217.64 --> 1224.3600000000001
us in a very consistent pattern

1221.78 --> 1227.48
but it doesn't it's it's only light that

1224.36 --> 1230.4189999999999
circles around us and only appears

1227.48 --> 1232.4
like that from our specific Observer

1230.419 --> 1234.74
Vantage coin if you go to another's

1232.4 --> 1237.02
Observer vantage point then that same

1234.74 --> 1239.659
light that the first person sees is not

1237.02 --> 1242.36
going to show the same

1239.659 --> 1244.5200000000002
output it's look it's going to look

1242.36 --> 1245.6589999999999
different it's non-local holographic

1244.52 --> 1247.8799999999999
right

1245.659 --> 1250.5200000000002
pretty much the debate between flat

1247.88 --> 1252.3200000000002
earthers and globers made me see that

1250.52 --> 1254.24
that's when I first started saying wait

1252.32 --> 1257.3799999999999
it's holographic

1254.24 --> 1257.38
and nobody got it

1258.679 --> 1266.8600000000001
oh wow got some real intellect here

1264.08 --> 1266.86
jeez

1271.159 --> 1278.0590000000002
perhaps no it's not noonak to blessed

1274.94 --> 1281.6200000000001
the stars are also holographic all the

1278.059 --> 1281.62
celestials are holographic

1289.94 --> 1295.039
and Holograms produce an amount of heat

1292.34 --> 1298.4599999999998
yeah they can all agree you can get a

1295.039 --> 1301.58
tan from a hologram yeah oh the other

1298.46 --> 1304.82
polishes they get so funny yeah I named

1301.58 --> 1305.78
in my show that once or twice I don't

1304.82 --> 1308.48
remember

1305.78 --> 1311.24
but yeah you can get a tan from a

1308.48 --> 1313.34
hologram the holographic

1311.24 --> 1315.6200000000001
light output because yeah that's the

1313.34 --> 1317.539
only thing that we can make yeah

1315.62 --> 1319.4599999999998
if it's strong enough yeah then you can

1317.539 --> 1320.6
have a hologram of something that's not

1319.46 --> 1322.52
really there it's going to be quite

1320.6 --> 1325.1589999999999
blinding and if you stand next to it

1322.52 --> 1327.02
you're gonna get a tan from it

1325.159 --> 1330.38
even though

1327.02 --> 1336.22
it's not really a thing that's there

1330.38 --> 1336.22
it's just light emanating from there

1338.299 --> 1342.46
in relation to you the Observer

1344.9 --> 1348.88
whoever it's a hologram God

1349.34 --> 1354.1589999999999
like

1350.36 --> 1354.1589999999999
[ __ ] kind of question is that

1356.539 --> 1364.34
it's a clock it's a mechanism it just

1358.76 --> 1364.34
functions as as it Cycles dictate

1375.62 --> 1381.4399999999998
the energy that creates heat comes from

1377.84 --> 1383.48
it yeah sure it does and I'm sure that

1381.44 --> 1386.419
that works the same with the holographic

1383.48 --> 1389.1200000000001
celestials the thing that is causing

1386.419 --> 1392.179
them is the energy source that causes us

1389.12 --> 1393.86
to get a tannin etc etc yeah

1392.179 --> 1396.26
I'm sure

1393.86 --> 1399.1999999999998
I don't know how I don't know how to

1396.26 --> 1401.299
simulate anything like that

1399.2 --> 1403.94
dude you could like get all these

1401.299 --> 1407.4189999999999
pointless imaginations of how that

1403.94 --> 1412.22
mechanical would work I could it's

1407.419 --> 1415.1000000000001
outside of the Dome or a device in the

1412.22 --> 1417.38
earth blah blah or you could just like

1415.1 --> 1420.62
leave it the [ __ ] alone and just figure

1417.38 --> 1425.0800000000002
out how it works exactly and not get

1420.62 --> 1425.08
deluded by physicality assumption bias

1426.559 --> 1431.4189999999999
I would want God want Holograms

1429.919 --> 1433.039
ah

1431.419 --> 1435.26
well

1433.039 --> 1437.419
there's a certain part of those

1435.26 --> 1441.08
Holograms

1437.419 --> 1445.3400000000001
that are basically the thing that keeps

1441.08 --> 1447.98
life going here in the realm say that's

1445.34 --> 1449.24
a pretty good reason why God wants that

1447.98 --> 1450.799
hologram

1449.24 --> 1453.2
yeah

1450.799 --> 1455.3799999999999
it's kind of part of the plan I would

1453.2 --> 1455.38
say

1458.179 --> 1460.779
foreign

1461.97 --> 1465.4
[Music]

1469.19 --> 1473.209
[Music]

1474.86 --> 1479.32
yes the Moon is a hologram also

1481.22 --> 1484.1200000000001
all of it is

1484.7 --> 1491.919
all of those lights up there

1487.1 --> 1491.9189999999999
Stars moons planets and all of it

1492.64 --> 1498.7990000000002
including the weird infrared lights you

1495.98 --> 1501.2
see like scouring around like

1498.799 --> 1503.9
little fishes in a pond

1501.2 --> 1505.88
all of it all those effects all

1503.9 --> 1508.3400000000001
holographic

1505.88 --> 1511.64
none of it is actually originating from

1508.34 --> 1514.22
objects in a specific position in

1511.64 --> 1517.24
euclidean space within this realm it's

1514.22 --> 1517.24
all holographic

1523.14 --> 1527.3600000000001
[Music]

1525.799 --> 1531.22
what the hell are you talking about

1527.36 --> 1531.2199999999998
Terry 306 I have no idea

1533.0 --> 1537.799
what

1534.14 --> 1540.14
[Music]

1537.799 --> 1542.179
you're not talking about that silly

1540.14 --> 1544.46
conception of the black Sun that comes

1542.179 --> 1546.8200000000002
out of the Freemason cosmology model

1544.46 --> 1546.82
right

1547.039 --> 1549.98
because that thing is completely

1548.659 --> 1552.3200000000002
delusional

1549.98 --> 1555.98
has nothing to do with physical reality

1552.32 --> 1559.34
it might be something in like the

1555.98 --> 1561.52
other dimension or whatever man I don't

1559.34 --> 1561.52
know

1562.94 --> 1567.0800000000002
like even the Dark World I'd been

1564.919 --> 1568.5200000000002
referenced to the black Sun it was all

1567.08 --> 1569.84
just weird

1568.52 --> 1571.8799999999999
like

1569.84 --> 1573.5
it's yeah

1571.88 --> 1577.24
it

1573.5 --> 1577.24
didn't seem real to me

1587.24 --> 1594.6200000000001
there's no black sun in the physical

1589.779 --> 1597.22
experienced reality I can tell you that

1594.62 --> 1597.2199999999998
foreign

1604.299 --> 1610.22
even in my visions

1607.1 --> 1612.3999999999999
it does not look like a solar eclipse at

1610.22 --> 1612.4
all

1612.679 --> 1615.22
so

1620.179 --> 1623.779
although that would have been

1621.44 --> 1626.26
interesting but it didn't just look

1623.779 --> 1626.26
black

1628.64 --> 1631.96
like a hole

1650.899 --> 1655.1589999999999
okay Georgetown yeah that's interesting

1653.36 --> 1657.9189999999999
I know Eric dollar has said some

1655.159 --> 1661.22
interesting things about the Sun

1657.919 --> 1663.6200000000001
but say it's a converter

1661.22 --> 1665.8990000000001
that's already too much physicality

1663.62 --> 1669.02
assumption bias like it is not a thing

1665.899 --> 1671.4799999999998
it is a output

1669.02 --> 1673.76
now that output may be specifically

1671.48 --> 1676.779
designated

1673.76 --> 1680.059
to be a converter of all types of

1676.779 --> 1685.419
spectrum of energy as he said yeah

1680.059 --> 1685.4189999999999
but it is not a thing you see

1685.76 --> 1692.059
it what you're seeing is the effect it's

1688.46 --> 1695.74
just an effect Holograms are effects

1692.059 --> 1695.74
they're not objects

1717.86 --> 1724.84
the moon's hologram supposed to make it

1720.98 --> 1724.84
believe it is a solid object

1725.44 --> 1732.3200000000002
well supposed to are you trying to

1728.96 --> 1736.1000000000001
Define God's will concerning the Moon

1732.32 --> 1738.8799999999999
and the reason for its appearance

1736.1 --> 1738.8799999999999
I don't know

1749.299 --> 1753.22
maybe maybe it was

1756.26 --> 1761.899
look

1757.34 --> 1763.52
it might simply be like a warning sign

1761.899 --> 1766.2199999999998
like

1763.52 --> 1768.2
because of the power of knowledge of

1766.22 --> 1769.76
astrology

1768.2 --> 1772.22
right

1769.76 --> 1775.58
that they put it in there

1772.22 --> 1777.46
to not make it too easy to access so

1775.58 --> 1782.84
there are like weird

1777.46 --> 1784.76
effects about it to make your mind dwell

1782.84 --> 1787.059
so yeah maybe

1784.76 --> 1791.6
maybe the Moon looks the way it does

1787.059 --> 1794.96
specifically to distract you away

1791.6 --> 1798.1
of the astrological implications of the

1794.96 --> 1798.1000000000001
celestials entirely

1799.1 --> 1801.58
Maybe

1810.93 --> 1814.17
[Music]

1819.08 --> 1824.4399999999998
do what are why are you asking this

1842.24 --> 1849.039
dude if you've misspelled that just

1844.64 --> 1849.039
remove the sentence and type it again

1853.24 --> 1862.72
[Music]

1858.919 --> 1862.72
hello Andrea coombe

1871.91 --> 1875.15
[Music]

1882.6 --> 1885.79
[Music]

1930.559 --> 1932.6789999999999
okay

1958.399 --> 1962.12
sorry I got some internet connection

1960.44 --> 1964.64
issue

1962.12 --> 1967.789
hey Kitty

1964.64 --> 1967.789
[Music]

1997.88 --> 2005.519
being dishonest with us

2000.76 --> 2005.519
no it's not being dishonest with us

2006.64 --> 2012.279
it's just testing you it's another part

2009.7 --> 2014.32
of creation

2012.279 --> 2017.559
it's the distraction part it's the

2014.32 --> 2020.5
aberrations I mean seriously

2017.559 --> 2024.7
what you're gonna blame

2020.5 --> 2026.74
like the idea of gravity onto God as

2024.7 --> 2030.519
well because that is what people then

2026.74 --> 2033.22
naturally tend to stumble onto right

2030.519 --> 2035.559
just as you would be looking at the

2033.22 --> 2038.2
holographic Moon and think like wow that

2035.559 --> 2039.8799999999999
kind of looks like a ball with craters

2038.2 --> 2042.82
or something

2039.88 --> 2045.5390000000002
cheese right

2042.82 --> 2045.539
I mean

2049.599 --> 2055.2400000000002
all those appearances don't actually

2052.119 --> 2059.099
take away from just the astrological

2055.24 --> 2059.0989999999997
Rhythm of the sky clock

2059.2 --> 2064.1389999999997
but it can distract you away from that

2084.75 --> 2087.94
[Music]

2090.159 --> 2094.139
gravity is just a concept

2099.7 --> 2105.4199999999996
and God didn't make gravity gravity is

2102.7 --> 2105.4199999999996
an aberration

2105.64 --> 2113.0789999999997
God did make was relative density

2109.9 --> 2115.599
that this equilibrium of it

2113.079 --> 2118.7200000000003
and then man

2115.599 --> 2121.2400000000002
created a formula to oversimplify that

2118.72 --> 2123.4599999999996
and they named it gravity and the

2121.24 --> 2125.0789999999997
creative options that were tied in and

2123.46 --> 2128.02
could be locked in

2125.079 --> 2131.7400000000002
with the physical physicality assumption

2128.02 --> 2134.2
bias based view of the celestial lights

2131.74 --> 2136.0
as a giant outer space cosmology and

2134.2 --> 2138.5789999999997
then it all fits together that's what

2136.0 --> 2140.68
happened it's aberration hooked into

2138.579 --> 2144.099
another aberration

2140.68 --> 2146.2599999999998
and those are dwellings for the mind and

2144.099 --> 2149.02
yeah that it was always going to be

2146.26 --> 2151.119
there it is part of creation

2149.02 --> 2153.64
it's part of creation that there are

2151.119 --> 2157.54
dwellings everywhere you go

2153.64 --> 2161.7999999999997
there is no Flawless Road

2157.54 --> 2164.98
to Ascension it doesn't exist

2161.8 --> 2167.38
God is not just going to give it to you

2164.98 --> 2169.18
yeah it's a narrow path

2167.38 --> 2171.099
it's tough

2169.18 --> 2173.2599999999998
you're gonna face challenges and then

2171.099 --> 2175.42
when you face the challenges and you get

2173.26 --> 2179.0200000000004
it right then everybody's against you

2175.42 --> 2181.7200000000003
yeah you think that's a joke

2179.02 --> 2184.48
it's not a joke

2181.72 --> 2186.5789999999997
it it is what happens

2184.48 --> 2189.52
because everybody

2186.579 --> 2191.5600000000004
Taps into the same aberration the same

2189.52 --> 2194.619
mind dwellings and most people aren't

2191.56 --> 2197.2
even willing to consider dwelling with

2194.619 --> 2200.38
their Consciousness on them they will

2197.2 --> 2202.96
just per default give the the basic

2200.38 --> 2205.54
Earthly response to it

2202.96 --> 2208.0
and that's how somebody has really high

2205.54 --> 2210.64
insight and dares to the threat outside

2208.0 --> 2213.28
of the norm with very complex things

2210.64 --> 2217.7799999999997
gets those responses from everybody

2213.28 --> 2217.78
including their peers ridicule

2220.06 --> 2222.96
it's what happens

2224.56 --> 2230.98
God did not make a mistake with gravity

2227.2 --> 2233.2599999999998
gravity doesn't exist It's Made Up by

2230.98 --> 2235.66
man

2233.26 --> 2236.6800000000003
it's an oversimplification of relative

2235.66 --> 2239.8799999999997
density

2236.68 --> 2239.8799999999997
that's what it is

2251.98 --> 2256.7400000000002
lots of new you yeah it's just trolls

2254.32 --> 2256.7400000000002
mostly

2257.859 --> 2264.839
or I don't know weirdo followers who

2260.98 --> 2264.839
like to hang around at Jim Bob's too

2266.38 --> 2269.5
I think I'm getting quite a bit of

2268.0 --> 2271.72
attention through Jim Bob Channel

2269.5 --> 2273.4
because I do like to hang around in that

2271.72 --> 2274.8999999999996
chat and Jim Bob actually does address

2273.4 --> 2278.52
me and all that

2274.9 --> 2278.52
and I get on there sometimes

2278.92 --> 2286.8
but yeah Jim Bob does also attract

2282.64 --> 2286.7999999999997
like intellectual weirdos

2289.18 --> 2295.68
people that are smart and have very

2291.579 --> 2295.6800000000003
weird social habits

2319.02 --> 2325.54
right so yeah to finally answer like

2323.619 --> 2327.88
since you're saying oh gravity it's made

2325.54 --> 2330.2799999999997
by God right he made everything yeah

2327.88 --> 2333.46
yeah he provides

2330.28 --> 2336.76
all things all possibilities even to

2333.46 --> 2338.5
those who are wrong yeah even when

2336.76 --> 2340.9
you're wrong when you're dwelling when

2338.5 --> 2343.96
you're in the grip of Satan even then he

2340.9 --> 2346.54
provides yeah so in that sense yeah God

2343.96 --> 2348.76
made gravity God made that structural

2346.54 --> 2350.16
misunderstanding

2348.76 --> 2354.7000000000003
through

2350.16 --> 2357.22
man's mind through demonic dwellings

2354.7 --> 2359.2599999999998
because they are all basically all

2357.22 --> 2362.859
directed by him anyway

2359.26 --> 2365.1400000000003
since it's all part of the same system

2362.859 --> 2367.359
so in that sense yeah God makes

2365.14 --> 2369.8199999999997
everything everything you've ever

2367.359 --> 2372.52
thought of the most Splendid things the

2369.82 --> 2375.4
grossest nightmares all of it all

2372.52 --> 2379.44
factors all powers all forces all of it

2375.4 --> 2379.44
it's all from God that's right

2381.4 --> 2387.099
it's very important to make a

2383.44 --> 2390.579
distinguishment though as to what type

2387.099 --> 2395.099
of side of God made it

2390.579 --> 2395.099
instead of the Gods is it of the Demons

2397.48 --> 2402.16
is it being Guided by Devils or is it

2400.0 --> 2405.3
being torn down by demons

2402.16 --> 2405.2999999999997
all of this matters

2410.92 --> 2416.5
I think the gym UPS it's

2413.079 --> 2419.6400000000003
it's in my favorite list

2416.5 --> 2419.64
in the grass Tyson

2425.319 --> 2427.98
but sure

2431.98 --> 2434.98
foreign

2464.44 --> 2467.4
uh

2470.02 --> 2476.8
hello Godzilla by the way I have to what

2474.28 --> 2479.2200000000003
Jay Dyer but I don't know what you're

2476.8 --> 2479.2200000000003
talking about

2519.28 --> 2522.28
foreign

2539.319 --> 2544.8
dude sounds like you need to clean up

2542.44 --> 2544.8
your desk

2586.06 --> 2592.42
this hologram theory is hard to grasp

2588.88 --> 2594.94
yeah no [ __ ] Sherlock

2592.42 --> 2597.7000000000003
I mean it's a non-local hologram you

2594.94 --> 2600.04
literally can never grasp it it's it

2597.7 --> 2602.68
will never come within physical reach

2600.04 --> 2605.56
ever yeah that is kind of hard to grasp

2602.68 --> 2608.2599999999998
I get it it's freaky

2605.56 --> 2610.24
it makes me feel like yeah actually it's

2608.26 --> 2612.4
like everything is like a Holodeck it's

2610.24 --> 2615.8999999999996
just always something there

2612.4 --> 2615.9
like a background picture

2616.66 --> 2621.22
that you can never reach it

2618.819 --> 2622.839
yeah that's freaky I know it is really

2621.22 --> 2625.359
weird

2622.839 --> 2628.0789999999997
it's the most sensible model that I can

2625.359 --> 2628.0789999999997
make of it though

2650.5 --> 2655.119
and if you want to look into it more

2652.72 --> 2657.0989999999997
that that will be great I don't know any

2655.119 --> 2658.78
sources though other than me talking

2657.099 --> 2661.839
about it

2658.78 --> 2663.8190000000004
and I'm not joking I don't know anybody

2661.839 --> 2666.7599999999998
else

2663.819 --> 2668.98
I I don't I have not seen a single

2666.76 --> 2672.2200000000003
person out there ever

2668.98 --> 2675.099
that is like on to this thing in the

2672.22 --> 2678.24
same way that I am zero they're always

2675.099 --> 2681.579
stuck in physical world

2678.24 --> 2685.2999999999997
always local always local always local

2681.579 --> 2686.5600000000004
always always always always local

2685.3 --> 2689.28
yeah

2686.56 --> 2694.56
you go and find me another

2689.28 --> 2694.5600000000004
non-local hologram Celestial guy

2694.619 --> 2699.42
that'll just blow my mind by itself

2714.06 --> 2720.9
Jesus Godzilla

2717.819 --> 2720.9
that's just terrible

2725.5 --> 2730.18
if she's just playing Candy Crush and

2728.079 --> 2730.92
why didn't you just get her like an iPad

2730.18 --> 2735.0989999999997
or something

2730.92 --> 2735.099
[Music]

2743.02 --> 2746.02
anyways

2756.4 --> 2762.339
once you find the projector the

2759.04 --> 2764.7
Holograms falls into place well what if

2762.339 --> 2767.68
you could never find it because it is

2764.7 --> 2770.68
outside of reach

2767.68 --> 2773.3799999999997
what did if it is outside of

2770.68 --> 2776.98
physical reach what if the projector is

2773.38 --> 2778.839
right outside of the barrier

2776.98 --> 2781.119
but you wouldn't be able to see it

2778.839 --> 2784.06
anyway it's just coming from it's all

2781.119 --> 2788.1400000000003
non-local like the entire thing what if

2784.06 --> 2790.48
like the entire top plate of it all is

2788.14 --> 2793.0
the projector the top plate is the

2790.48 --> 2795.4
projector and from within the realm you

2793.0 --> 2798.099
could never see how it's just the cause

2795.4 --> 2800.079
of it oh you want to cover it up yeah

2798.099 --> 2803.8
that'll probably stop all the celestial

2800.079 --> 2806.5
lights if you just go there somehow and

2803.8 --> 2810.6400000000003
you you foam over

2806.5 --> 2812.68
the entire firmament Plateau that'll

2810.64 --> 2814.2999999999997
probably make the celestial lights go is

2812.68 --> 2816.339
that good enough for you I mean we only

2814.3 --> 2818.92
have to like destroy our life on Earth

2816.339 --> 2821.02
to test it I mean that's worth it right

2818.92 --> 2823.2400000000002
right

2821.02 --> 2827.94
uh

2823.24 --> 2827.9399999999996
that's my point like uh

2832.18 --> 2837.52
then maybe even that just wouldn't do it

2834.819 --> 2839.8
at all and it turns out like it's

2837.52 --> 2842.02
just the projectors in the fourth

2839.8 --> 2843.819
dimension it's just not in third

2842.02 --> 2845.5
Dimensions projecting in from fourth

2843.819 --> 2847.68
dimension you can't see it because

2845.5 --> 2851.5
you're locked into a

2847.68 --> 2854.5589999999997
three-dimensional experience yes yeah so

2851.5 --> 2857.92
it would be literally never testable

2854.559 --> 2860.6800000000003
ever in physical reality ever

2857.92 --> 2862.78
it's a non-local hologram it's there you

2860.68 --> 2865.66
can't do anything about it you could

2862.78 --> 2868.78
never do anything to test its nature

2865.66 --> 2872.319
scientifically and that's that

2868.78 --> 2875.44
where we can definitely figure out how

2872.319 --> 2877.96
it seems to work

2875.44 --> 2880.059
the exact patterns of it we already have

2877.96 --> 2882.819
the Cycles we already have the cyclical

2880.059 --> 2885.6400000000003
nature of it how it's a sky clock and we

2882.819 --> 2888.16
can progress that knowledge by figuring

2885.64 --> 2892.96
out how it is uh how it is

2888.16 --> 2896.02
holographically apparent to us

2892.96 --> 2897.76
make it into a 3D like hologram path

2896.02 --> 2901.059
system

2897.76 --> 2903.1600000000003
just to have understanding of how it

2901.059 --> 2906.94
will appear to you on every location

2903.16 --> 2908.5
imaginable within the realm right that's

2906.94 --> 2911.8
like that's as far as you could go

2908.5 --> 2915.88
probably it probably is limited to that

2911.8 --> 2919.48
that means that yes I will never ever

2915.88 --> 2922.0
within my life probably be able to lay

2919.48 --> 2923.859
down scientific evidence to prove that

2922.0 --> 2928.18
the celestials are holographic that's

2923.859 --> 2931.0
right yep never ever in my lifetime it's

2928.18 --> 2934.9199999999996
the most likely end result I know does

2931.0 --> 2934.92
it mean I'm not [ __ ] right though

2936.64 --> 2939.18
foreign

2945.24 --> 2951.04
ties are

2947.44 --> 2953.68
we don't know we're so special because

2951.04 --> 2956.92
we don't make a claim oh it's a we can

2953.68 --> 2960.16
get it wrong oh yes

2956.92 --> 2961.78
yes just just don't think about it

2960.16 --> 2965.46
that's the solution

2961.78 --> 2965.46
that's the smartest thing to do

2967.85 --> 2971.31
[Music]

2972.839 --> 2979.38
you and B no I never heard of that Mike

2976.599 --> 2979.38
said the niche

2996.819 --> 3002.2799999999997
I thought you said this was a concept

2999.46 --> 3004.92
though yeah no [ __ ] Sherlock I just said

3002.28 --> 3007.619
that I just laid down I can never

3004.92 --> 3009.839
scientifically prove it

3007.619 --> 3012.48
what do you mean you thought it was just

3009.839 --> 3015.0589999999997
a concept yeah it's a concept that is

3012.48 --> 3017.76
the [ __ ] reality and I will never be

3015.059 --> 3021.3
able to prove it yeah it's still the

3017.76 --> 3024.2400000000002
reality this is what is going on I am

3021.3 --> 3025.8
correct I will turn out to be correct I

3024.24 --> 3030.8999999999996
will never be able to prove

3025.8 --> 3033.119
scientifically that I am correct yeah

3030.9 --> 3037.76
good enough for you are you getting it

3033.119 --> 3037.76
yet are you getting it yet huh

3038.9 --> 3042.239
[Music]

3043.079 --> 3047.4900000000002
foreign

3044.24 --> 3047.49
[Music]

3056.45 --> 3059.62
[Music]

3069.14 --> 3075.9
Mining and complaining about it

3072.96 --> 3078.599
just you just don't understand in this

3075.9 --> 3081.599
case I feel like that Flat Earth they're

3078.599 --> 3084.1800000000003
talking to anti-flat earthers except

3081.599 --> 3087.3590000000004
all of you guys are the anti-flat

3084.18 --> 3090.72
authors in this regard

3087.359 --> 3092.4
starting to get kind of annoying

3090.72 --> 3093.9599999999996
right

3092.4 --> 3099.619
doesn't mean I'm gonna stop though

3093.96 --> 3099.619
because I need this to be understood

3114.599 --> 3119.42
it is when it's a concept

3119.64 --> 3122.64
foreign

3124.339 --> 3130.38
rectangular looping Realm

3127.26 --> 3133.38
direct the looping is a concept that's

3130.38 --> 3136.5
one that is disprovable

3133.38 --> 3138.54
it's very testable you could you could

3136.5 --> 3141.319
basically expose it to a black swarm

3138.54 --> 3141.319
like situation

3141.839 --> 3150.42
right and then deduce that it is correct

3146.579 --> 3153.059
or incorrect and what the loop is how it

3150.42 --> 3154.98
connects all these things it don't give

3153.059 --> 3156.78
a [ __ ] if anybody doesn't understand it

3154.98 --> 3158.22
I've been talking about for [ __ ] five

3156.78 --> 3160.26
years now

3158.22 --> 3161.9399999999996
still don't get it it's not my [ __ ]

3160.26 --> 3166.0200000000004
problem

3161.94 --> 3169.16
that's a concept it's testable yeah the

3166.02 --> 3171.48
holographic nature of the celestials

3169.16 --> 3176.04
non-local hologram

3171.48 --> 3179.46
you can't ever prove that within physics

3176.04 --> 3182.2799999999997
not even within the Carl popper analogy

3179.46 --> 3185.52
just can't do it

3182.28 --> 3188.52
only thing I could ever prove is

3185.52 --> 3191.52
or this is not proof it's just like yeah

3188.52 --> 3193.92
there's absolute hundred percent absence

3191.52 --> 3197.46
of evidence that the celestial bodies

3193.92 --> 3199.6800000000003
are objects in euclidean space from

3197.46 --> 3202.44
which this light emanates that is

3199.68 --> 3206.16
something that's as far as it goes

3202.44 --> 3209.339
there's nothing more I can do

3206.16 --> 3212.04
unless you want to risk destroying all

3209.339 --> 3215.22
life on Earth just to [ __ ]

3212.04 --> 3217.319
quench your [ __ ] little curiosity

3215.22 --> 3221.04
about the cosmology because you can't

3217.319 --> 3224.0589999999997
help yourself yeah well how about not

3221.04 --> 3224.0589999999997
doing that

foreign

3306.25 --> 3309.32
[Music]

3314.42 --> 3318.42
that have wrenches that have actually

3316.92 --> 3323.48
proven

3318.42 --> 3323.48
that they have like an inkling of reason

3324.54 --> 3328.5589999999997
that help you figure it out

3327.299 --> 3331.319
yeah

3328.559 --> 3333.7400000000002
I just don't understand is a pointless

3331.319 --> 3333.74
comment

3333.9 --> 3337.5
and it is a troll and I don't care even

3335.94 --> 3340.38
if it is a troll

3337.5 --> 3342.059
or somebody that is acting trollish

3340.38 --> 3344.2200000000003
because they don't know what to do in

3342.059 --> 3346.799
response to what I'm talking

3344.22 --> 3348.8999999999996
which would be a poser troll somebody

3346.799 --> 3350.7
actually curious but just not knowing

3348.9 --> 3353.2200000000003
how to compose themselves and end up

3350.7 --> 3355.4399999999996
acting like a troll I don't know it

3353.22 --> 3358.339
could be either and both need to shut

3355.44 --> 3358.339
the [ __ ] up

3365.25 --> 3371.11
[Music]

3372.619 --> 3378.1800000000003
yeah we got definite dirt gone for

3376.619 --> 3381.98
oh well

3378.18 --> 3381.98
at least yesterday was all peaceful

3385.319 --> 3389.819
you were up early today okay

3388.02 --> 3393.98
well that means you had the time to

3389.819 --> 3393.98
watch my show yesterday entirely then

3403.319 --> 3407.94
I'm not that late suddenly like half an

3406.2 --> 3410.1189999999997
hour late yesterday I was an hour late

3407.94 --> 3413.099
almost

3410.119 --> 3415.559
and I'm Gonna Keep yeah I'm gonna keep

3413.099 --> 3419.0
doing the show

3415.559 --> 3419.0
until I'm done anyway

3440.54 --> 3444.9
clutch what the hell are you talking

3442.559 --> 3447.48
about dark energy

3444.9 --> 3449.76
what sounds like dark energy like where

3447.48 --> 3452.04
did that come in

3449.76 --> 3456.42
dark energy is just a bunch of math

3452.04 --> 3458.94
nonsense extract based on gravity that's

3456.42 --> 3462.38
it I don't see how that has to do with a

3458.94 --> 3462.38
light anything about it

3505.859 --> 3511.4
yeah all is good

3508.44 --> 3511.4
I'm fine

3528.72 --> 3535.04
by the way if you have seen Akira or if

3531.66 --> 3535.04
you were gonna watch Akira

3535.14 --> 3540.1189999999997
you might see why that movie also

3537.72 --> 3544.4599999999996
resonates with me so much because people

3540.119 --> 3544.46
are just so [ __ ] aggressive in them

3544.819 --> 3549.359
they're like aggressive all the [ __ ]

3548.52 --> 3551.88
time

3549.359 --> 3555.359
oh

3551.88 --> 3557.9
and I so get it man

3555.359 --> 3557.9
like

3558.299 --> 3563.099
I kind of used to be like that except I

3561.059 --> 3565.2000000000003
had it all locked in

3563.099 --> 3567.299
so I I was just practically never

3565.2 --> 3569.2799999999997
aggressive it was just so aggressive in

3567.299 --> 3572.7599999999998
my mind all the time and then watching

3569.28 --> 3575.099
this movie was like what the [ __ ] like

3572.76 --> 3577.619
what is this world

3575.099 --> 3581.1800000000003
I never knew there was anything like

3577.619 --> 3581.1800000000003
that outside of me

3583.02 --> 3585.619
huh

3591.96 --> 3596.54
kept refreshing looking for the Stream

3596.7 --> 3601.5789999999997
I don't get it

3599.099 --> 3601.579
whatever

3617.94 --> 3626.16
I'm gonna suggest an anime Maybe

3623.099 --> 3629.78
ninja Scrolls

3626.16 --> 3629.7799999999997
yeah I have seen that one

3629.94 --> 3639.299
this is a long time ago by the way

3633.78 --> 3643.7400000000002
that's a decent one it just never really

3639.299 --> 3646.02
got to me or anything not like Akira

3643.74 --> 3647.9399999999996
that's a long time ago since I watched

3646.02 --> 3649.559
that maybe I should watch it again

3647.94 --> 3650.819
because I almost don't remember what

3649.559 --> 3654.48
it's about

3650.819 --> 3656.2799999999997
but it's more like ancient Japan

3654.48 --> 3659.599
not

3656.28 --> 3659.599
modern but

3661.14 --> 3664.74
like Akira by the way one thing that

3663.18 --> 3667.44
really stood out to me also in

3664.74 --> 3670.2
retrospect is just that

3667.44 --> 3674.76
there's no mobile phones in Akira it's

3670.2 --> 3677.16
like kind of cool it's like huh

3674.76 --> 3679.3190000000004
not everybody's staring in this stupid

3677.16 --> 3683.0989999999997
little phone all day

3679.319 --> 3685.44
it's kind of cool like it almost makes

3683.099 --> 3687.839
me like that world more than the real

3685.44 --> 3689.4
one even though everything is going to

3687.839 --> 3691.74
[ __ ]

3689.4 --> 3696.319
because there's no mobile phones in that

3691.74 --> 3696.319
world I mean there are like lasers

3696.66 --> 3703.22
and of course that light Weaponry yeah

3700.68 --> 3703.22
but

3704.64 --> 3712.3799999999997
like that's actually like delightful to

3709.02 --> 3716.599
see a future Envision without [ __ ]

3712.38 --> 3716.599
mobile phones I mean what a great

3719.52 --> 3724.5
just look at everything we sacrificed in

3722.4 --> 3727.02
our way of going about in our expression

3724.5 --> 3728.819
in our planning because of the [ __ ]

3727.02 --> 3731.46
mobile phones man

3728.819 --> 3733.68
and you can really see that if you pay

3731.46 --> 3735.539
attention in Akira too because you get

3733.68 --> 3737.819
to see this modern world he has gone to

3735.539 --> 3739.8590000000004
[ __ ] but at least people are not staring

3737.819 --> 3742.0389999999998
in their [ __ ] little mobiles all day

3739.859 --> 3742.0389999999998
long

3748.38 --> 3754.039
since the Avengers the Sci-Fi is

3754.079 --> 3758.48
okay Tony with him

3764.039 --> 3770.539
I think a lot of sci-fi is kind of

3766.2 --> 3770.5389999999998
[ __ ] even from the start

3780.059 --> 3784.5
that's right everyone got on just fine

3782.64 --> 3786.1189999999997
the four mobiles

3784.5 --> 3787.859
and there's just like there's still

3786.119 --> 3789.96
local phones they're still girls

3787.859 --> 3792.7799999999997
blabbering on the phone

3789.96 --> 3794.099
right that there's a scene like that in

3792.78 --> 3796.38
Akira

3794.099 --> 3798.0
like get some laundry

3796.38 --> 3801.48
place

3798.0 --> 3804.96
since some girl talking on the phone

3801.48 --> 3807.599
right so it's still gonna be girls

3804.96 --> 3809.819
talking on phones it's just not

3807.599 --> 3811.98
everybody in the [ __ ] streets is just

3809.819 --> 3813.5389999999998
staring in a stupid mobile people are

3811.98 --> 3815.88
actually looking around like hey who's

3813.539 --> 3818.88
there hey who's that do I recognize that

3815.88 --> 3821.839
person instead of like

3818.88 --> 3821.839
all day long

3831.09 --> 3834.2690000000002
[Music]

3843.48 --> 3849.18
gotta try and keep us fixed on globes in

3846.359 --> 3852.48
films lately yeah before you know it

3849.18 --> 3855.0
you're gonna have like a

3852.48 --> 3857.76
dude you could have technically already

3855.0 --> 3859.68
make that you have those like Nintendo

3857.76 --> 3862.079
switch or something that has like a

3859.68 --> 3864.1189999999997
hologram effect

3862.079 --> 3867.42
they just have a glow Earth projector on

3864.119 --> 3872.52
it just like oh and you can stare all

3867.42 --> 3874.6800000000003
day at a 3D hologram of the globe

3872.52 --> 3877.319
yes

3874.68 --> 3879.98
just look at the globe look at the globe

3877.319 --> 3879.98
forget everything

3881.76 --> 3886.92
all right I mean the spinning ball Earth

3884.16 --> 3889.22
is effectively a hypnot a hypnotizing

3886.92 --> 3889.2200000000003
device

3890.88 --> 3894.26
isn't it

3892.38 --> 3898.28
spinning glow

3894.26 --> 3898.28
it's a hypnotizing device

3904.079 --> 3908.6400000000003
then especially if you just freshly

3906.42 --> 3911.16
awoken to Flat Earth

3908.64 --> 3913.2599999999998
away from the globe light then you will

3911.16 --> 3915.5989999999997
feel that you will see a spinning glove

3913.26 --> 3918.119
you'll be like ah freaking hypnotized

3915.599 --> 3920.4
device go away

3918.119 --> 3923.28
it'll hurt

3920.4 --> 3925.98
I'm kind of over it now I'm used to it

3923.28 --> 3929.96
but it is the hypnotizing device in my

3925.98 --> 3929.96
opinion the spinning globe

3943.799 --> 3947.46
huh yeah that's good to hear Godzilla

3946.2 --> 3950.64
yeah

3947.46 --> 3954.78
dude I'm seeing people go around and

3950.64 --> 3958.14
they don't even have like a a bank pass

3954.78 --> 3961.8590000000004
they have it on their mobile now they

3958.14 --> 3965.819
can just do their mobile like oh that's

3961.859 --> 3969.859
not gonna make you dependent at all oh

3965.819 --> 3971.52
you put it all in that one device

3969.859 --> 3975.319
yes

3971.52 --> 3975.319
nothing could go wrong

3975.96 --> 3978.68
God

4000.38 --> 4005.6600000000003
but they're watching yeah that too

4002.38 --> 4007.099
that's stupid weird Google watch [ __ ]

4005.66 --> 4009.2599999999998
whatever

4007.099 --> 4012.5
I just don't get it I don't want to get

4009.26 --> 4016.2990000000004
it I think that a fast multi-pass thing

4012.5 --> 4016.299
that's good enough you know

4016.819 --> 4021.02
you don't

4018.38 --> 4025.119
don't make your freaking Electronics

4021.02 --> 4025.119
device your multi-pass don't do it

4025.88 --> 4028.9
keep it separate

4033.98 --> 4038.979
[Music]

4040.0 --> 4047.98
give me convenience or gifty death that

4044.059 --> 4047.98
is hilarious Godzilla thank you for that

4048.07 --> 4054.1600000000003
[Music]

4051.319 --> 4054.16
God

4056.0 --> 4058.599
oh

4062.839 --> 4072.14
use cash only well I mean monthly pass

4068.24 --> 4076.359
is pretty handy but yeah I just make

4072.14 --> 4076.359
sure that cash never becomes

4077.359 --> 4083.5989999999997
no longer an option just make sure it is

4080.24 --> 4085.16
always like legal tender right

4083.599 --> 4087.38
and then

4085.16 --> 4089.42
then it's fine like whether you like

4087.38 --> 4092.48
using it or you don't like using it

4089.42 --> 4095.9
right just keep it an option make sure

4092.48 --> 4098.239
they never make it illegal make sure

4095.9 --> 4100.9
it's always declared legal tender like

4098.239 --> 4100.9
that you know

4113.839 --> 4118.46
our goes out only when will be cash well

4116.779 --> 4120.92
you have power but if power goes out

4118.46 --> 4123.7390000000005
then everything is [ __ ] George

4120.92 --> 4125.299
right so either power won't go out

4123.739 --> 4127.639999999999
because everybody know everybody's going

4125.299 --> 4129.319
to be [ __ ] so there will be like

4127.64 --> 4131.900000000001
emergency

4129.319 --> 4135.02
electricity aggregates

4131.9 --> 4136.639999999999
Motors in the back room and all that

4135.02 --> 4138.7390000000005
to keep things running because if

4136.64 --> 4141.38
literally that's not there then that

4138.739 --> 4143.178999999999
means that all refrigerators unthaw

4141.38 --> 4146.179
Foods couldn't spoil everything is

4143.179 --> 4148.46
[ __ ] no into no internet no

4146.179 --> 4150.02
communication no trade

4148.46 --> 4151.46
so

4150.02 --> 4153.859
yeah

4151.46 --> 4156.02
if everything is down cash might still

4153.859 --> 4159.52
function there's just not going to be a

4156.02 --> 4159.52
lot to do with it left

4160.339 --> 4165.799
right unless you're like on the Outback

4162.62 --> 4168.259
in the Wilder in the wilderness

4165.799 --> 4170.239
and you're not dealing with communities

4168.259 --> 4172.219
that are very dependent on cash and then

4170.239 --> 4174.5599999999995
it's still are on electricity and then

4172.219 --> 4177.7390000000005
it's still going to work fine

4174.56 --> 4179.96
I should say on the electricity grid

4177.739 --> 4181.58
because they will probably need some

4179.96 --> 4182.839
electricity but they'll just produce it

4181.58 --> 4186.46
themselves

4182.839 --> 4186.46
with Aggregates and whatever

4192.42 --> 4200.899
[Music]

4206.36 --> 4210.799999999999
right okay I don't know why I use the

4208.159 --> 4213.339999999999
word aggregate for that the power

4210.8 --> 4213.34
generator

4214.4 --> 4217.73
maybe it's different in Dutch that's why

4217.04 --> 4222.199
I'm using it

4217.73 --> 4224.299999999999
[Music]

4222.199 --> 4228.5599999999995
yeah it is

4224.3 --> 4232.28
in Dutch aggregate he is literally like

4228.56 --> 4235.219
one of those power generator thingies

4232.28 --> 4237.5599999999995
like a Diesel steam generator they call

4235.219 --> 4241.0
it an aggregate but in English it's not

4237.56 --> 4241.0

4286.94 --> 4291.08
ads for like oh this power generator

4289.1 --> 4293.780000000001
that power generator so

4291.08 --> 4296.42
the Dutch clearly assimilated the word

to specifically mean those types of

use object or

the food you produce as currency of

you could use milk or cheese if you're

making that right there's all kinds of

4934.12 --> 4941.179
bypass the taxation system

be more subtle then it's really fun

5347.679 --> 5354.28
that's so brutal hahaha

5351.1 --> 5356.9800000000005
but if I then really think about it it's

5354.28 --> 5359.5599999999995
just actually not funny at all and it's

5356.98 --> 5361.419999999999
just the shock and my inability to deal

5359.56 --> 5362.4400000000005
with it in that moment that made me

5361.42 --> 5366.46
laugh

5362.44 --> 5368.379999999999
and then afterwards confuse me about it

5366.46 --> 5370.2390000000005
being funny

5368.38 --> 5373.139
because I don't think it is actually

5370.239 --> 5373.138999999999
funny like that

5381.6 --> 5387.58
laughs

5383.199 --> 5389.62
yes of course yeah Life of Brian is yeah

5387.58 --> 5393.659
that

5389.62 --> 5393.659
you'll find it please

5394.139 --> 5400.6
oh God they're not gonna do that right

5396.94 --> 5405.419999999999
now but yeah that scene is probably the

5400.6 --> 5405.42
funnest funniest scene in cinema history

5408.58 --> 5414.58
do I get it Google

5412.06 --> 5418.9800000000005
when I say the name

5414.58 --> 5418.98
because did this

5421.36 --> 5428.08
he has a wife you know

5425.08 --> 5430.719
you know what she is cooked

5428.08 --> 5434.08
in Continental

5430.719 --> 5434.08
in continents

5436.42 --> 5440.02
of course

5437.86 --> 5442.78
because that you don't have to even know

5440.02 --> 5446.320000000001
what the hell is going on in that movie

5442.78 --> 5449.259999999999
to see the that that is just hilarious

5446.32 --> 5451.599999999999
in a very juvenile way but in a

5449.26 --> 5453.219
universally juvenile way like everybody

5451.6 --> 5455.860000000001
in the world

5453.219 --> 5457.96
pretty much that's like a boy

5455.86 --> 5460.0599999999995
at least would think that's funny

5457.96 --> 5462.82
everywhere in the world you don't have

5460.06 --> 5465.400000000001
to know anything about the movie to get

5462.82 --> 5468.46
a giggle out of that

5465.4 --> 5472.239
you just gotta like understand

5468.46 --> 5475.26
learning Roman in school

5472.239 --> 5475.259999999999
that's all

5475.3 --> 5478.369000000001
[Music]

5481.16 --> 5484.349999999999
[Music]

5504.58 --> 5508.3
I don't know how we ended up talking

5506.56 --> 5509.9800000000005
about this I don't know what I'm doing

5508.3 --> 5514.7390000000005
today man

5509.98 --> 5514.739
I'm very much going all over the place

5540.82 --> 5545.139
blowing

5543.34 --> 5548.34
yeah sure

5545.139 --> 5548.34
well I'm feeling good

5549.699 --> 5555.58
I mean I've had like an exceptionally

5552.46 --> 5557.56
good sleep this night

5555.58 --> 5560.5
it helped that I kind of synchronized

5557.56 --> 5562.900000000001
having taken a shower yesterday and like

5560.5 --> 5565.84
washing my entire bed

5562.9 --> 5567.759999999999
and it not being a super hot

5565.84 --> 5569.26
morning

5567.76 --> 5571.54
it's just

5569.26 --> 5573.88
because like the last week I've almost

5571.54 --> 5576.28
been like waking up kind of sweaty every

5573.88 --> 5578.139
morning and it's really annoying

5576.28 --> 5580.12
and it just didn't have that this time

5578.139 --> 5582.639
and then I had some extra sleep that

5580.12 --> 5586.32
really hit the spot

5582.639 --> 5586.32
so I just feel much more

5586.659 --> 5593.98
rather less unstable it's just

5589.96 --> 5598.0
everything just I don't seem to be

5593.98 --> 5601.839999999999
easily moved around in my energy

5598.0 --> 5604.84
in a bad way I mean it's good that it's

5601.84 --> 5606.46
not being moved around easily in a bad

5604.84 --> 5608.46
way

5606.46 --> 5608.46
um

5614.62 --> 5619.3
what

5617.139 --> 5622.36
no idea who you're talking about borders

5619.3 --> 5624.6990000000005
boy then again I've never been like all

5622.36 --> 5626.799999999999
too familiar with stand-up comedy

5624.699 --> 5630.099999999999
universally

5626.8 --> 5633.04
barely barely

5630.1 --> 5635.620000000001
I was a little into it sort of in the

5633.04 --> 5637.6
Netherlands in the 90s it's just the

5635.62 --> 5641.679
Netherlands stuff never even heard

5637.6 --> 5644.5
anybody else out there like I only heard

5641.679 --> 5647.92
this is George Carlin I only got to know

5644.5 --> 5650.679
him like after are you already dead

5647.92 --> 5652.54
I never heard of him before that

5650.679 --> 5654.76
amazing

5652.54 --> 5657.96
uh

5654.76 --> 5657.96
and all those others

5658.659 --> 5664.96
it's really kind of when I dove onto the

5661.48 --> 5666.638999999999
English scene I guess through Alex Jones

5664.96 --> 5669.46
also

5666.639 --> 5671.92
and the conspiracy sector which most of

5669.46 --> 5674.56
it is just English

5671.92 --> 5675.639
and that's how I got to know all this

5674.56 --> 5681.06
media

5675.639 --> 5681.06
before that I it was just Dutch media

5681.159 --> 5685.179
right in a couple of movies here and

5683.44 --> 5688.0599999999995
there from America

5685.179 --> 5689.619
but a lot of Dutch media before that I

5688.06 --> 5693.42
did they had no idea what was actually

5689.619 --> 5693.42
going on in in detail

5693.46 --> 5698.56
the entire 20th century

5696.34 --> 5701.400000000001
I had no idea what's going on in America

5698.56 --> 5701.400000000001
or England

5719.739 --> 5724.44
right so I don't know who you're talking

5721.48 --> 5724.44
about borders boy

5742.36 --> 5748.799999999999
oh by the way little

5744.58 --> 5748.8
a little weird Oddity

5749.38 --> 5755.4400000000005
I don't know if you guys remember I was

5751.36 --> 5758.199
watching like blood of Zeus right

5755.44 --> 5760.48
was it now two weeks ago or something

5758.199 --> 5761.379999999999
very impressed by still I watched it

5760.48 --> 5762.879999999999

5762.88 --> 5769.719
season coming woohoo

5765.76 --> 5772.659000000001
so looking forward to that universally

5769.719 --> 5775.679
also I noticed like in the voice list

5772.659 --> 5775.679
like what the [ __ ]

5775.719 --> 5780.88
Hera was actually voiced by

5779.619 --> 5783.5199999999995
uh

5780.88 --> 5786.6990000000005
I'm sorry I never I'd never get a name

5786.699 --> 5791.199

5791.199 --> 5795.5199999999995

5803.8 --> 5810.4800000000005

5995.26 --> 6000.719
is offensive now okay well then

5998.98 --> 6004.138999999999
that means

6000.719 --> 6005.76
let's make fun of how everything is

6004.139 --> 6009.78
offensive then

6005.76 --> 6012.54
to a bunch of nut cases

6009.78 --> 6016.44
right is what I've been doing it's just

6012.54 --> 6018.9
like I'm gonna just do it anyway then

6016.44 --> 6021.599999999999
and then I'm gonna like extra press on

6018.9 --> 6023.96
it how stupid it is that you're offended

6021.6 --> 6023.96
by it

6025.92 --> 6030.78
I don't know if that's a good stand-up

6027.9 --> 6033.179
comedy tactic but then again I am not a

6030.78 --> 6036.139
stand-up comic so

6033.179 --> 6036.139
comedian

6061.86 --> 6064.86
anyhow

6065.82 --> 6068.719
foreign

6097.76 --> 6100.879
[Music]

6100.88 --> 6106.02

6103.739 --> 6108.259999999999
it is now what you guys are talking

6106.02 --> 6108.26
about

6109.26 --> 6112.26
foreign

6132.719 --> 6136.58
but I guess I'll check it out

6139.139 --> 6141.7390000000005

6142.8 --> 6145.400000000001
foreign

6164.639 --> 6168.92
thanks for looking that up for me guys

6170.88 --> 6174.38
let's have to do everything here

6174.42 --> 6177.26
foreign

6179.239 --> 6183.78
so I don't know if he's actually funny

6181.679 --> 6186.02
but that's what everybody's talking

6183.78 --> 6186.0199999999995
about

6255.06 --> 6260.6990000000005
I'm going to give you a minute

6258.36 --> 6263.339999999999
if nobody says anything then I'm gonna

6260.699 --> 6266.419999999999
run out the show immediately

6263.34 --> 6266.42
I'm not having this

6277.98 --> 6281.48
hey kiwi gamer

6282.179 --> 6287.9400000000005
streaming for tonight oh yeah you're in

6285.239 --> 6290.94
Australia take it

6287.94 --> 6294.299999999999
now I've been going for an hour 43

6290.94 --> 6299.178999999999
minutes so far I was planning on going

6294.3 --> 6299.179
another 17 minutes but yeah

6299.639 --> 6305.46
people are just gonna leave the chat

6302.4 --> 6309.619
alone for five minutes straight huh

6305.46 --> 6309.619
you know how I feel about that one

6337.86 --> 6340.46
foreign

6377.699 --> 6381.619
then we can dig something up

6420.0 --> 6425.04
so does anybody have any idea basically

6422.88 --> 6428.6990000000005
what was going on yesterday yesterday

6425.04 --> 6430.679
seems to have been like a Pivot Point

6428.699 --> 6433.44
somehow

6430.679 --> 6436.5
ah we just got shot

6433.44 --> 6439.82
still don't know much about it very

6436.5 --> 6439.82
little data about it

6440.82 --> 6447.0
on Benjamin's duck got murdered by a

6444.239 --> 6448.98
by a weasel

6447.0 --> 6452.0
sounds like it all happened in pretty

6448.98 --> 6452.0
much the same moment

6455.58 --> 6460.82
what happened when I was

6457.8 --> 6460.820000000001
I'm stupid

6471.84 --> 6476.28
I was still in the middle of like the

6473.699 --> 6478.5
whole Akira thing

6476.28 --> 6480.9
so maybe that's it

6478.5 --> 6483.08
maybe that's why I got pulled into it so

6480.9 --> 6483.08
much

6483.54 --> 6486.8
I don't know what's going on

6488.34 --> 6494.54
yeah lots of things so there's like a

6490.56 --> 6494.54
pivot point somehow yesterday

6495.659 --> 6501.96
let's

6497.4 --> 6504.5
yeah the 8th of July 2022 something was

6501.96 --> 6504.5
going on

6505.92 --> 6510.32
and for that of course like the

6510.54 --> 6514.92
Georgia Guidestones got blown up the

6513.06 --> 6516.54
night before

6514.92 --> 6519.6
and then

6516.54 --> 6522.5
yeah the eighth all kinds of [ __ ] just

6519.6 --> 6522.5
started happening

6522.6 --> 6528.179
like a chopping block event type

6525.36 --> 6530.4
situation so what else has happened I

6528.179 --> 6532.7390000000005
mean I wouldn't be surprised if some

6530.4 --> 6534.599999999999
like people got assassinated all over

6532.739 --> 6537.48
the world we're just not even hearing

6534.6 --> 6539.88
about it like what happened

6537.48 --> 6541.379999999999
is there some kind of astrological

6539.88 --> 6544.6990000000005
conjunction

6541.38 --> 6544.6990000000005
that I don't know about

6575.159 --> 6577.699
foreign

6602.0 --> 6608.0
this guy looked like what are you

6604.44 --> 6608.0
talking about this guy

6616.26 --> 6621.619000000001
no I don't have a younger brother in

6619.139 --> 6621.619
Australia

6621.659 --> 6627.44
that would be weird I don't know like

6624.06 --> 6627.4400000000005
how that would even be possible

6630.84 --> 6634.6990000000005
unless they clone me or something

6639.179 --> 6643.92
and how do you even know how I look like

6641.28 --> 6646.44
without the mustache I mean are you

6643.92 --> 6652.02
comparing that to like my

6646.44 --> 6652.0199999999995
pre mustache online appearance really

6653.699 --> 6658.739
because I am quite a

6655.98 --> 6662.638999999999
quite a bit of a mix of different types

6658.739 --> 6662.638999999999
of regions Eurasian

6662.76 --> 6666.900000000001
right Indonesia

6665.219 --> 6671.4800000000005
China

6666.9 --> 6671.48
Germany Netherlands Belgium

6672.54 --> 6677.719
dad a little bit of Jew in there

6678.659 --> 6684.659
mostly Dutch I mean that's

6681.719 --> 6686.88
maybe it's the Indonesian element that's

6684.659 --> 6688.5599999999995
recognizable because that is kind of

6686.88 --> 6691.26
close to

6688.56 --> 6693.8
Australia and all that

6691.26 --> 6693.8
so

6695.219 --> 6700.86
I very I've I don't see a lot of people

6698.099 --> 6704.0
that look like me

6700.86 --> 6704.0
I really don't

6711.48 --> 6718.159
but I don't know maybe to you guys all

6714.48 --> 6718.159
our wins look alike or something

6762.179 --> 6768.54
I need all they are when you know right

6765.179 --> 6770.52
well I'm the only R when I know but

6768.54 --> 6771.32
I wish to say that's going to stay like

6770.52 --> 6774.5
that

6771.32 --> 6774.5
you know

6812.78 --> 6817.86
[Music]

6815.699 --> 6819.0599999999995
in a way it's actually kind of a scary

6817.86 --> 6822.92
idea

6819.06 --> 6822.92
to have a whole group of arwins

6823.26 --> 6827.88
like

6824.52 --> 6831.4800000000005
what if we formed a gang or something

6827.88 --> 6833.639
then every Arwen would try to be like

6831.48 --> 6835.5599999999995
the biggest arowin

6833.639 --> 6837.900000000001
so they were almost all constantly be

6835.56 --> 6840.719
Arwen pushing each other to be even more

6837.9 --> 6842.219
Arwin dude that could like get pretty

6840.719 --> 6844.219
out of hand

6842.219 --> 6844.219
s

6844.8 --> 6850.56
yep ah

6847.199 --> 6853.08
I could Envision almost like Akira like

6850.56 --> 6854.639
motor gang type situations because we

6853.08 --> 6856.08
would all be pushing each other like

6854.639 --> 6858.38
what are you scared what are you scared

6856.08 --> 6858.38
or something

6858.56 --> 6862.34
oh sweet no

6877.38 --> 6883.4400000000005
your laptop is near potatoes

6881.52 --> 6886.02
right

6883.44 --> 6887.699
well technically if you're doing virus

6886.02 --> 6889.92
scans and all that you shouldn't be

6887.699 --> 6892.678999999999
having any activity on your computer

6889.92 --> 6895.5
while you're doing that

6892.679 --> 6899.179
because that can like

6895.5 --> 6899.179
stall the process a lot

6903.96 --> 6908.179
that mostly mean like internet activity

6938.76 --> 6943.92
well yeah PGC dude I don't know but I

6941.82 --> 6945.179
don't know if like it all depends you

6943.92 --> 6947.4
know if you're like in the middle of a

6945.179 --> 6950.04
city it doesn't matter but

6947.4 --> 6952.379999999999
yeah if those cats would literally go

6950.04 --> 6956.54
out into jungle Wilderness they are

6952.38 --> 6956.54
gonna ravage the wildlife they do

6967.739 --> 6973.08
what I'd instead like opt for is more

6970.26 --> 6975.599
like a cat Garden situation is just like

6973.08 --> 6978.0
the territory where they can kind of be

6975.599 --> 6981.360000000001
out in the open and trees and grass and

6978.0 --> 6981.36
whatever bushes

6982.02 --> 6986.6990000000005
but they should not go out into wild

6984.719 --> 6990.08
parameters

6986.699 --> 6990.08
I kind of agree to that

6993.599 --> 6999.4800000000005
how to actually accomplish that

6997.56 --> 7002.0
there's many ways of approaching that

6999.48 --> 7004.82
but everybody has to First decide like

7002.0 --> 7008.36
yeah we're not gonna allow these cats to

7004.82 --> 7010.94
go out into the jungle

7008.36 --> 7014.739
and then kind of like

7010.94 --> 7014.739
figure out how to do that

7018.619 --> 7025.48
oh Jeff gashead

7020.659 --> 7025.48
no I'm not going to be a [ __ ] pirate

7026.72 --> 7030.7390000000005
[Music]

7028.58 --> 7033.0199999999995
so not as a film so maybe as an extra

7030.739 --> 7034.699
I'd be a pirate

7033.02 --> 7038.619000000001
but I'm not gonna be a freaking film

7034.699 --> 7038.619
star as a pirate thank you very much

7046.94 --> 7049.419999999999
hmm

7050.06 --> 7053.38
uh psych bear

7055.46 --> 7060.4
they're all kind of late I was about to

7057.619 --> 7060.4
round out the show

7080.05 --> 7085.9400000000005
[Music]

7081.739 --> 7088.28
right yeah Terry 306 yeah thank God it

7085.94 --> 7091.839999999999
is your cord and not the battery I mean

7088.28 --> 7091.84
the cord is a lot cheaper to replace

7097.76 --> 7101.92
oh [ __ ]

7099.32 --> 7101.92
what

7108.38 --> 7111.28
what the

7112.46 --> 7116.26
that sounds painful

7118.639 --> 7123.86
maybe you were you rode that same wave

7122.119 --> 7126.619
of like

7123.86 --> 7129.38
wave of sacrifice that hit the rest of

7126.619 --> 7130.46
the world if if that is the moment when

7129.38 --> 7135.219
it happened

7130.46 --> 7135.219
territ that's kind of uncanny

7139.88 --> 7144.7390000000005
oh you're not feeling good oh okay sorry

7142.28 --> 7148.3
Jeff gassett I hope you get better soon

7144.739 --> 7148.299999999999
what seems to be the problem

7153.08 --> 7155.92
foreign

7182.92 --> 7188.679
jeez Terrace it's quite a Calamity there

7239.36 --> 7244.78
ain't your medication

7241.36 --> 7244.78
what do you mean

7245.08 --> 7248.86
from what to what

7330.619 --> 7338.619
yeah Terra 306 yes speedy recovery and

7334.94 --> 7338.619
just make sure that's

7340.04 --> 7344.08
keep all your wounds clean and all that

7379.239 --> 7384.759999999999
see what is that and for what

7384.8 --> 7388.42
never even heard of that

7396.27 --> 7399.469
[Music]

7418.04 --> 7420.699
what

7424.219 --> 7427.42
what the [ __ ]

7433.94 --> 7437.619
oh okay

7440.179 --> 7445.46
right so it's a

7442.4 --> 7450.879999999999
it's just stuff that makes you like

7445.46 --> 7450.88
eject excess fluids a lot

7453.02 --> 7455.8
hmm

7458.0 --> 7463.55
yeah that well that would make make you

7460.52 --> 7466.219
feel pretty terrible I can imagine

7463.55 --> 7468.860000000001
[Music]

7466.219 --> 7471.86
so it's like a post operation type

7468.86 --> 7471.86
substance

7497.42 --> 7500.96
all right okay I guess you speedy

7499.52 --> 7503.179
recovery too do you have guys ahead and

7500.96 --> 7505.46
I hope you uh

7503.179 --> 7508.0
get out of it well

7505.46 --> 7508.0
oh

7549.56 --> 7553.6990000000005
all right I'll take it easy then Jeff

7552.199 --> 7557.178999999999
and uh

7553.699 --> 7560.598999999999
make sure you don't stress yourself out

7557.179 --> 7563.02
by getting all caught up in nonsense of

7560.599 --> 7563.02
this world

7564.02 --> 7567.280000000001
that would be my advice

7583.699 --> 7586.239
hmm

7606.619 --> 7611.92
uh yeah don't do what water's voice says

7612.44 --> 7618.5599999999995
brilliant yes post operation borders boy

7617.0 --> 7620.599
oh yeah that's

7618.56 --> 7623.679
yeah you're a little bit too late for

7620.599 --> 7623.679
that advice buddy

7625.579 --> 7632.599
I mean if somebody's already in issues

7628.76 --> 7634.599
oh let's just completely

7632.599 --> 7636.8
from scratch

7634.599 --> 7640.34
fundamentally rearranged their diet

7636.8 --> 7642.88
that's not gonna give trouble at all yes

7640.34 --> 7642.88
it is

7654.619 --> 7663.0199999999995
like going vegan would potentially be a

7659.44 --> 7665.78
preventative measure

7663.02 --> 7668.42
she already like post operation and all

7665.78 --> 7671.599
dude that's not

7668.42 --> 7674.96
that's not gonna work out great

7671.599 --> 7677.54
unless the person like when they hear

7674.96 --> 7679.699
like oh vegan diet oh that might really

7677.54 --> 7681.8
be a good idea if they have the impulse

7679.699 --> 7684.259999999999
of like yeah oh that has that's the

7681.8 --> 7687.5
thing I need to do then yeah sure go for

7684.26 --> 7688.280000000001
it I wouldn't recommend it per default I

7687.5 --> 7690.32
mean

7688.28 --> 7692.36
your body's already in position where it

7690.32 --> 7695.0599999999995
like is needing to recover

7692.36 --> 7698.659
that's not the time to just radically

7695.06 --> 7700.579000000001
rearrange your entire diet

7698.659 --> 7704.5
right

7700.579 --> 7704.5
it's not the right timing for that

7706.639 --> 7713.42
I mean if you eat super unhealthy then

7710.06 --> 7716.4800000000005
it is kind of time to radically cut down

7713.42 --> 7720.02
on the Terrible Things You Eat Right

7716.48 --> 7722.54
but not just and rearrange your entire

7720.02 --> 7723.92
Foundation of how you eat that's not the

7722.54 --> 7727.42
time

7723.92 --> 7727.42
party's in recovery

7727.52 --> 7731.02
could give complications

7733.82 --> 7736.0
foreign

7739.82 --> 7746.659
anyway I am rounding out the shell half

7743.06 --> 7748.88
past the two hour mark already

7746.659 --> 7752.54
but uh yeah

7748.88 --> 7756.52
I really want some lunch

7752.54 --> 7756.5199999999995
so yeah best of luck Jeff

7758.179 --> 7763.78

7760.639 --> 7763.78

7811.28 --> 7815.96
please keep supporting me

7813.44 --> 7818.299999999999
I yeah I'm gonna have to get through

7815.96 --> 7821.96
this summer too you know

7818.3 --> 7825.860000000001
right so I'll be back tomorrow with flat

7821.96 --> 7825.86
Earth early bird number 1299

7826.099 --> 7831.92
um so I'm reaching the 1300 mark

7829.94 --> 7834.5599999999995
it's really interesting

7831.92 --> 7837.679
13's always been my lucky number

7834.56 --> 7840.320000000001
like especially concerning financial

7837.679 --> 7842.96
situation serious it's my financial

7840.32 --> 7846.32
lucky number every time

7842.96 --> 7850.4
how did I come to grow into that belief

7846.32 --> 7852.32
well because every time Friday the 13th

7850.4 --> 7855.32
happened like throughout my youth I

7852.32 --> 7857.5599999999995
would always find excessive amounts of

7855.32 --> 7857.5599999999995
money

7857.78 --> 7861.679
that would be shocking to me I'd find

7860.119 --> 7863.96
like

7861.679 --> 7866.84
uh what is it

7863.96 --> 7868.82
then Gilder bills or

7866.84 --> 7872.3
other currencies if I was in another

7868.82 --> 7874.46
like I would always find money

7872.3 --> 7878.3
on days like that

7874.46 --> 7882.28
and like every time every time

7878.3 --> 7885.8
it still kind of happens it's weird

7882.28 --> 7887.599
but yeah it's I'm not like oh I'm so

7885.8 --> 7890.06
enthusiastic because it's Friday the

7887.599 --> 7892.04
13th because then that typically happens

7890.06 --> 7894.5
now it's like oh yeah it's a good day

7892.04 --> 7895.88
I'm just not afraid of Friday the 13th

7894.5 --> 7898.34
I'm

7895.88 --> 7901.46
I'm not I'm not going out to find money

7898.34 --> 7902.659000000001
or anything he used to actually do that

7901.46 --> 7905.179
okay

7902.659 --> 7907.638999999999
finding money was always great

7905.179 --> 7909.4400000000005
it's like treasure hunting

7907.639 --> 7912.56
anyhow

7909.44 --> 7915.159
approaching the 1300s

7912.56 --> 7915.159000000001
quickly

7916.04 --> 7920.659
but uh yeah still the 12.99 on the

7919.639 --> 7924.7390000000005
Sunday

7920.659 --> 7927.259999999999
I'll try to be a little bit more on time

7924.739 --> 7928.94
and otherwise I'll just won't be on time

7927.26 --> 7930.56
and then I'll just keep going a little

7928.94 --> 7937.239
longer

7930.56 --> 7937.2390000000005
so anyhow I hope I see you all tomorrow

7937.82 --> 7942.259999999999
on that Sundays no ball busters this

7939.92 --> 7945.639
evening so it's going to be a bit of a

7942.26 --> 7945.639
quiet Saturday I think

7945.92 --> 7953.41
but

7947.78 --> 7963.32
