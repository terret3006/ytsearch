2.27 --> 9.96
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.0 --> 19.17
early-bird number 56 I'm your host

9.96 --> 22.5
Arwen and today's not too cold day not

19.17 --> 25.14
too warm funny because I see chickens

22.5 --> 27.33
walking around right across the street

25.14 --> 30.48
like a big horde of them they've been

27.33 --> 37.079
walking around in that small patch of

30.48 --> 39.51
woods what's been left all day it's not

37.079 --> 43.46
the chickens I was trying to protect

39.51 --> 43.46
earlier you can see them

43.86 --> 49.309
the camera can sharpen they're across

47.1 --> 49.309000000000005
the street

50.43 --> 53.66
walking back into the garden

56.42 --> 65.03
and anyway yeah birds are all over the

61.76 --> 71.74
place they really get it and that the

65.03 --> 73.43
fireworks gone just roaming around so

71.74 --> 81.16999999999999
hello everyone

73.43 --> 83.45
in chat Cleary Flat Earth Nichols in

81.17 --> 88.67
earlier life is shortened

83.45 --> 92.99000000000001
Daniel fields and yeah we've been having

88.67 --> 94.85
a very elaborate discussion also I've

92.99 --> 104.509
been having an elaborate discussion on

94.85 --> 109.929
skype with Kosho and yeah matrix media

104.509 --> 111.229
hello andreas design mark Matthews but

109.929 --> 114.56
over

111.229 --> 116.36
Mukul Nicolas good to see you truth

114.56 --> 120.369
seeker mafia 36

116.36 --> 121.82
yeah yesterday's hangout man that was a

120.369 --> 126.88
blast

121.82 --> 130.78
literally was a record record hangout

126.88 --> 133.64
it's the biggest one I've ever had and

130.78 --> 139.66
yeah it was really nice to have Nathan

133.64 --> 139.66
back on and everything let's see

142.79 --> 152.569
yeah like people been telling me nobody

144.83 --> 155.62900000000002
cares but I do care I got yeah it's like

152.569 --> 161.17999999999998
the fourth highest ranking huge videos

155.629 --> 165.79899999999998
that I had within two hours so that was

161.18 --> 169.93
pretty badass very happy about it then

165.799 --> 169.93
let's see if I can share that for a sec

172.15 --> 178.12
call me vain or whatever

182.37 --> 185.33
so yeah

185.53 --> 193.83
pretty excited and it was so long so I

189.49 --> 193.83
guess yeah that's to be expected

202.61 --> 211.29000000000002
hey hey hello Anthony what about me I

210.09 --> 212.76
hate you man

211.29 --> 215.19
and she Nathan in all the goodness well

212.76 --> 215.79
didn't hear my name okay there's a

215.19 --> 218.64
breakthrough

215.79 --> 221.25
oh sorry now I think I mentioned you

218.64 --> 223.79999999999998
anyway you were in the title so now yeah

221.25 --> 227.97
you and Nathan I think you haven't you

223.8 --> 230.01000000000002
being racist racist against what I mean

227.97 --> 231.93
what everybody's a victim out when

230.01 --> 236.76
everybody's a victim Oh God

231.93 --> 239.3
it seems so or silly or what are just

236.76 --> 247.59
very very silly

239.3 --> 253.59
so we're famous comedians one kids just

247.59 --> 254.88
doesn't give her the fireworks yeah so

253.59 --> 259.979
yeah you were on there and you were

254.88 --> 263.1
great I loved the miniature debates that

259.979 --> 263.96
you did with cinder and with was was

263.1 --> 267.3
really good

263.96 --> 271.669
and Nathan like really moving into his

267.3 --> 277.55
thing again almost like a holiday

271.669 --> 281.09999999999997
debates but he just yeah that was good

277.55 --> 283.169
he loves it a little too much well

281.1 --> 288.26000000000005
that's okay he's so good at it so why

283.169 --> 288.26
wouldn't he well exactly

288.289 --> 293.81
so where what's new what's new

297.43 --> 304.06
while siblings in curvature yep any

301.72 --> 307.449
evidence for curvature or gravity axial

304.06 --> 309.24
rotation no no how many people don't

307.449 --> 313.03000000000003
even know what the actual rotation

309.24 --> 316.06
anymore you know cause of Corey's effect

313.03 --> 318.039
and everything and because it is such a

316.06 --> 320.139
small thing it's only like yeah the

318.039 --> 323.34999999999997
heavens rotate so the earth must rotate

320.139 --> 326.289
that's pretty much it and of course

323.35 --> 333.25
doing this less gravity at the equator

326.289 --> 336.57
than the poles two things have you have

333.25 --> 342.07
you seen Nick pick up words latest video

336.57 --> 345.09999999999997
probably not basically he's asking if if

342.07 --> 346.63
a plane takes off in London say and

345.1 --> 348.82000000000005
flies right the way around to Australia

346.63 --> 350.26
why is it balls can't prove that the

348.82 --> 352.03
plane is actually flown around a curve

350.26 --> 354.21999999999997
why does everything indicate that it's

352.03 --> 356.79999999999995
flat so like gyroscopes or theodolites

354.22 --> 358.59900000000005
so it's a valid question what why why

356.8 --> 360.789
can ball does not show that the plane is

358.599 --> 366.849
flown and around around a curve before

360.789 --> 369.13
anything disspell that's yeah every time

366.849 --> 371.15999999999997
what they do is discredit or dispel the

369.13 --> 373.81
functions of something that's real and

371.16 --> 376.0
demonstrable like they dispel

373.81 --> 377.74
diffraction they just say no that's not

376.0 --> 379.75
what it's for it has nothing to do with

377.74 --> 381.31
anything it is curvature just stop

379.75 --> 382.69
talking about it's all nonsense all

381.31 --> 386.199
misinterpretation that's what they do

382.69 --> 390.4
with that and with gyroscopes say no no

386.199 --> 392.979
it adapts to the gravity of the earth so

390.4 --> 393.729
it is our base so they declared it is

392.979 --> 397.09
our based

393.729 --> 397.99
they just declare it and yeah but

397.09 --> 401.919
wouldn't you think there would be a

397.99 --> 404.349
scientific way to record the orientation

401.919 --> 405.789
of that plane when it takes off that's

404.349 --> 407.62
that's not gonna be affected by gravity

405.789 --> 409.3
you know like a physical way of doing it

407.62 --> 411.159
so that when it did land you could show

409.3 --> 413.62
that the plane had rotated rotated by

411.159 --> 415.09
you say 180 degrees and then you could

413.62 --> 417.55
marry up with your latitude and

415.09 --> 419.13899999999995
longitude positions and then cut make

417.55 --> 421.24
the prediction on the cut on them on the

419.139 --> 423.22
globe what would that what should be and

421.24 --> 425.05
obviously then you could test it over

423.22 --> 429.40000000000003
this doesn't even exist so it's like I

425.05 --> 430.569
was interested I don't know I think one

429.4 --> 433.179
way to really

430.569 --> 436.41900000000004
tested in a neutral way would be well

433.179 --> 438.429
all airplanes all modern airplanes have

436.419 --> 440.19899999999996
really good gyroscopes with pendulous

438.429 --> 445.37899999999996
vanes to correct for certain turns and

440.199 --> 449.469
all that go in there and have like a

445.379 --> 451.92900000000003
access to the I just say to the cockpit

449.469 --> 455.379
or have a camera installed specially to

451.929 --> 457.27
keep the the leveling parts track you

455.379 --> 459.09900000000005
have to like really get ya in

457.27 --> 461.289
conversation with the pilot to allow

459.099 --> 464.319
that so it's not going to be that easy

461.289 --> 467.169
but and at the same time have a regular

464.319 --> 468.78900000000004
gyroscope without pendulous face just

467.169 --> 472.899
sitting there in the back keep track of

468.789 --> 475.33
them both keep track of the GPS all of

472.899 --> 477.699
it simultaneously all that information

475.33 --> 482.08
simultaneously and just see what is the

477.699 --> 485.289
route what are the turns and really see

482.08 --> 488.25899999999996
what's happening but because we kinda

485.289 --> 490.659
flame a lot that pilots are just in on

488.259 --> 493.509
it and that they trick us with the

490.659 --> 496.209
routes that they just wanna do things

493.509 --> 498.339
like several turns or you know not even

496.209 --> 500.139
senators like very subtle turns and

498.339 --> 505.019
regions that you just don't notice it or

500.139 --> 505.019
something I don't know what they do but

506.55 --> 514.95
sorry drifting off you wanted to say

509.52 --> 516.51
something several times and I think the

514.95 --> 518.1
pendulous feigns argument is nonsense

516.51 --> 520.17
anyway I think we all realize that the

518.1 --> 522.57
pendulous famed is for high speed

520.17 --> 524.4
correction when the planes falling up

522.57 --> 526.6500000000001
the sky it stops the gyroscope from

524.4 --> 529.35
toppling basically it's a talk with

526.65 --> 532.35
juicer or a talk offer and what they

529.35 --> 534.27
claim it and that is just pure blatant

532.35 --> 539.52
dishonesty its complete lies it's not

534.27 --> 542.64
true what we claim it believe it we can

539.52 --> 544.41
counter prove that because if weren't

542.64 --> 546.99
you the same wouldna look theoretically

544.41 --> 549.9
if the pendulum would be correcting for

546.99 --> 553.53
the rotation of the earth bla bla ba or

549.9 --> 555.3299999999999
anything like that then just test it by

553.53 --> 557.37
having one with him his fame no one

555.33 --> 559.2900000000001
without just go with straight path

557.37 --> 562.47
regular straight path without sudden

559.29 --> 564.99
turns like in a jet or whatever just in

562.47 --> 567.45
a regular plane and just see does it do

564.99 --> 569.73
that because this one doesn't have the

567.45 --> 574.58
pendulous fame so you can immediately

569.73 --> 577.74
dispel that myth with actual proof

574.58 --> 580.5500000000001
recorded proof well they believe it if

577.74 --> 583.62
somebody like Wolfie claims it because

580.55 --> 586.1999999999999
will be some kind of like don't I'm like

583.62 --> 588.75
what right but if you actually have a

586.2 --> 594.99
set of that demonstrate that that isn't

588.75 --> 596.94
the case then you can just don't don't

594.99 --> 598.47
don't reduces if you talk to the cockpit

596.94 --> 600.99
you will see they have a three percent

598.47 --> 606.26
turning except by default and I'd like

600.99 --> 609.27
to see the evidence for that claim so

606.26 --> 610.71
where we oh the other thing was what's

609.27 --> 612.9
going on with peelers I believe that he

610.71 --> 616.95
had a bit of a rundown with the Ramsey

612.9 --> 620.22
last thing in the Sun way Oh God you

616.95 --> 624.35
mean yeah that nasty thing that happened

620.22 --> 624.35
um what is his name again

625.67 --> 636.509
Bronk ronsis no a video we on there this

632.519 --> 637.97
guy will refer him for if evidence or

636.509 --> 641.819
something like that

637.97 --> 645.9590000000001
yeah Flat Earth something yeah a guy

641.819 --> 648.42
that they bumped into talk to and he had

645.959 --> 650.5189999999999
a hangout and Randy went on and then P

648.42 --> 652.439
Mars went on and then he started getting

650.519 --> 655.74
in the trolling mood and then apparently

652.439 --> 659.49
he porn bombed him so this guy is now

655.74 --> 661.3100000000001
off his channel for like four months or

659.49 --> 668.519
something really evil

661.31 --> 671.0089999999999
so yeah P Mars you know kind of glad I

668.519 --> 672.86
banned him because he's really in a

671.009 --> 678.72
dangerous mood right now

672.86 --> 679.8000000000001
you can't trust him fourth theta what

678.72 --> 683.22
yeah could be

679.8 --> 685.1099999999999
Flat Earth data so unsalted says echo

683.22 --> 689.759
echo echo I guess that means you won't

685.11 --> 691.23
blink echo who's echoing no I think he's

689.759 --> 696.9590000000001
just saying that it's not a public link

691.23 --> 698.97
no no I've been telling you the P versus

696.959 --> 700.7399999999999
a scrum of the excellence I agree he

698.97 --> 703.259
doesn't I don't know why I don't always

700.74 --> 705.75
for all the busy I don't know what you

703.259 --> 711.029
know it's not a baller though he just

705.75 --> 716.309
seems to be a dick he's a troll and he's

711.029 --> 718.47
lonely so he likes doing this stuff yeah

716.309 --> 722.0889999999999
says this but then he gets in a favor

718.47 --> 725.129
and he starts to become reckless and

722.089 --> 727.889
shameless and borderline the heavy

725.129 --> 733.139
borderline stuff and yeah that's what

727.889 --> 733.8
we're seeing right now hey Jose boom I'm

733.139 --> 737.22
getting old

733.8 --> 739.17
look at that white beard wow I'm looking

737.22 --> 742.649
like pshare all of the sudden what do I

739.17 --> 746.55
know you're gonna turn into Gondo way

742.649 --> 749.309
before I do are you doing guys good

746.55 --> 751.49
morning good morning I was like how are

749.309 --> 751.49
you

751.79 --> 756.29
I am excellent just got off work maybe I

754.79 --> 759.699
don't know 20 minutes ago

756.29 --> 764.0
so yeah jumping in here with you

759.699 --> 766.79
so do you at night yeah nighttime 10

764.0 --> 769.69
p.m. I start 10 p.m. for me and get off

766.79 --> 769.6899999999999
at 6:30 in the morning

770.529 --> 776.449
so she finished with him right

773.709 --> 779.9899999999999
yeah just finish yeah

776.449 --> 782.24
little little past 6:30 today so at

779.99 --> 785.089
least I got time to now there are some

782.24 --> 789.0790000000001
days when the Florida Bay was on I could

785.089 --> 792.0500000000001
bernly never join the early bird because

789.079 --> 796.1899999999999
I they always keep us like an extra hour

792.05 --> 804.709
two hours after scheduled time so yeah

796.19 --> 806.4200000000001
he's good now getting off on time they

804.709 --> 807.68
cut my hours to be another week they

806.42 --> 809.6899999999999
said like you got to live like an hour

807.68 --> 813.949
earlier coming an hour late or take it

809.69 --> 814.7600000000001
two hours lunch like [ __ ] don't you over

813.949 --> 817.13
8 hours for it

814.76 --> 822.55
that's so you in the morning take it two

817.13 --> 826.55
hours loans bro man that's crazy

822.55 --> 829.43
yeah that's annoying if they make you do

826.55 --> 832.639
all the hours and then don't give you

829.43 --> 834.68
overtime and just try to manipulate the

832.639 --> 837.11
rest of your schedule to make it fit

834.68 --> 840.4699999999999
that's really annoying yeah they're

837.11 --> 843.4590000000001
[ __ ] Dana yeah I learned how to just

840.47 --> 846.1990000000001
[ __ ] with them I just say whenever I see

843.459 --> 849.1389999999999
half of the night I see that I'm gonna

846.199 --> 851.12
stay extra or they gonna want me to ask

849.139 --> 854.0600000000001
me after I go to the mill I said hey I'm

851.12 --> 856.4590000000001
living right on time at 6:30 I'm running

854.06 --> 858.17
out of here oh but we need you to I say

856.459 --> 859.91
yeah you need me to but I'm scheduled

858.17 --> 862.9699999999999
till this time and I'm gonna go home at

859.91 --> 864.649
this time so boom and yeah they kind of

862.97 --> 869.029
learn how to deal with now and they

864.649 --> 875.99
leave me alone when see Russian vids

869.029 --> 877.88
video about doubt it I have seen it when

875.99 --> 879.769
was there basically a man a Mandela

877.88 --> 882.92
fallin out for some reason I'm not sure

879.769 --> 884.649
what what Earnhardt's it was criticized

882.92 --> 887.2299999999999
in Delft for being like

884.649 --> 889.569
a gate keeper or whatever I'm not sure

887.23 --> 892.389
it was drama they fallen out how obvious

889.569 --> 893.3499999999999
or no you know who knows what and it

892.389 --> 895.389
made a couple of interesting points

893.35 --> 896.74
about his tattoos and I knew he had

895.389 --> 898.3
tattoos but I was never really

896.74 --> 900.85
interested in what we were sound

898.3 --> 903.429
basically suggested that perhaps he's

900.85 --> 906.61
some kind of gatekeeping idiot that's

903.429 --> 908.92
basically trying to control em flieth by

906.61 --> 911.819
keeping it divided as hell and not

908.92 --> 915.309
allowing any like kind of community

911.819 --> 919.149
integration really basically saying that

915.309 --> 922.149
yeah even really punishing that as a

919.149 --> 922.689
one-man show renting an example is

922.149 --> 924.91
absolute

922.689 --> 927.04
he's absolutely divisive but he divides

924.91 --> 929.319
him from everybody else me like I said I

927.04 --> 931.029
said to Russian goods in this in these

929.319 --> 933.04
comments I said that I've only ever

931.029 --> 934.66
spoken to him twice um once I went on

933.04 --> 937.3
his show and then once he get more

934.66 --> 938.889
Nathan show and he publicly spat at me

937.3 --> 941.16
each time and I was like you know what

938.889 --> 944.769
this is nonsense this is just ridiculous

941.16 --> 947.709
now it's it's a little bit of agitation

944.769 --> 950.7090000000001
for that he's using it's just a strategy

947.709 --> 953.1389999999999
and he has it in him he is very much

950.709 --> 954.8789999999999
like that time he has moves a lot of

953.139 --> 959.47
mood but seriously how is he a

954.879 --> 961.809
gatekeeper does he have actual Oh Karis

959.47 --> 964.8290000000001
what authority over people that people

961.809 --> 969.999
are like okay well if this says it then

964.829 --> 981.37
really yeah del yeah yeah yes follow

969.999 --> 983.679
Antonio people you know Tonio tells

981.37 --> 985.629
people that Patricia was a B or C and

983.679 --> 986.949
people sense it like question it but

985.629 --> 988.4490000000001
actually be believing it because he says

986.949 --> 990.549
it's true and they accepted his word

988.449 --> 992.559
then he's got the same kind of mentality

990.549 --> 995.199
but some of this follow us so that they

992.559 --> 996.549
think the same things that he so if he

995.199 --> 998.799
tells people not to integrate with

996.549 --> 1001.019
people and keep it individual I'm not

998.799 --> 1003.299
keeping it really low-key I don't agree

1001.019 --> 1005.689
with that I think the mission visit was

1003.299 --> 1007.949
really quite correct to point out that

1005.689 --> 1010.019
generally in the global light or were

1007.949 --> 1013.5889999999999
fantastic and they were really United

1010.019 --> 1015.24
and unity is the reason why I mean I'm

1013.589 --> 1016.35
more United than I am this United what

1015.24 --> 1018.48
he's clearly disunited

1016.35 --> 1022.5600000000001
I don't agree with this

1018.48 --> 1024.54
and I fit so well in the grant on the

1022.56 --> 1026.52
grand scale things to be fair I don't

1024.54 --> 1031.11
think that Dell has too much influence

1026.52 --> 1035.01
really I hope he doesn't now go all

1031.11 --> 1037.9799999999998
ranting and raving about now yeah when I

1035.01 --> 1040.11
can't show I know you have you have good

1037.98 --> 1043.199
sides you've bad sides you're just a guy

1040.11 --> 1047.54
and you're just being yourself really

1043.199 --> 1050.91
and yeah you are divisive at times and I

1047.54 --> 1053.6399999999999
don't know that's just part of who he is

1050.91 --> 1058.65
I don't know when he gets all divisive I

1053.64 --> 1063.3300000000002
just ignore him I get divisive no when

1058.65 --> 1064.74
devil gets divisive yeah sound on us did

1063.33 --> 1066.72
you join me in character or was it

1064.74 --> 1069.03
annoying to be honest on cap was a

1066.72 --> 1071.72
gentleman he was really he was a really

1069.03 --> 1074.07
nice guy he liked his book

1071.72 --> 1076.799
he's probably bad-mouthed me elsewhere

1074.07 --> 1078.36
on the online what I he was he was a

1076.799 --> 1079.44
gentleman to me and well he bought me a

1078.36 --> 1081.78
drink I bought him a drink back we

1079.44 --> 1085.5900000000001
shared a taxi and then he went oh I mean

1081.78 --> 1087.36
good night overall Lewis Hackett he did

1085.59 --> 1089.4599999999998
a little hangout and cut there was there

1087.36 --> 1092.4599999999998
I was there too and they talked a little

1089.46 --> 1095.49
bit about your your interaction and cut

1092.46 --> 1096.96
third he gave you kudos he say you are

1095.49 --> 1098.49
the best

1096.96 --> 1100.71
he said you were the man you're the best

1098.49 --> 1103.169
and you're awesome like he hung out with

1100.71 --> 1105.51
you and he felt good and he you know you

1103.169 --> 1108.0590000000002
guys clicked somehow you know for having

1105.51 --> 1110.34
this this opposite view and you guys

1108.059 --> 1113.1
click like you made before so he he

1110.34 --> 1116.309
actually yeah he took well about you for

1113.1 --> 1117.9599999999998
real I've know we got on strim in the

1116.309 --> 1119.46
minute I recognize his voice the minute

1117.96 --> 1121.8600000000001
I knew who he was all I had to give him

1119.46 --> 1123.809
a big hug there was no handshake it was

1121.86 --> 1126.059
just a big hug because I like I like

1123.809 --> 1127.32
kinda think that he's wrong but I like

1126.059 --> 1129.9289999999999
the guy I think he's a really nice guy

1127.32 --> 1139.6499999999999
and obviously seen in real world I put

1129.929 --> 1141.99
my opinion never changed right so I a

1139.65 --> 1144.3300000000002
quick a my my my view on this Dale

1141.99 --> 1147.929
Russian visa and there I saw the video

1144.33 --> 1149.82
the original and I was like holy [ __ ]

1147.929 --> 1151.89
you know because Russian Russian did he

1149.82 --> 1154.4399999999998
jump a lot in the del panel there

1151.89 --> 1155.97
sometimes question me like like what the

1154.44 --> 1157.68
hell would you with this numbers on

1155.97 --> 1160.4
whatever [ __ ] they bump heads and

1157.68 --> 1163.05
then they keep shouting along but then

1160.4 --> 1164.91
what I see the last time that they did a

1163.05 --> 1167.6699999999998
show maybe last week or the week before

1164.91 --> 1170.5800000000002
I was in the shot and I just listening

1167.67 --> 1173.22
to him like for the first time and if

1170.58 --> 1175.32
you were a baller if anybody is the

1173.22 --> 1177.45
baller I wanted to talk to them they

1175.32 --> 1180.1799999999998
have to be one of two either water

1177.45 --> 1182.43
benders because they have to show like a

1180.18 --> 1185.67
physical waterbending or they have to be

1182.43 --> 1187.65
gas master manipulators to show the gas

1185.67 --> 1189.78
pressure without a container other than

1187.65 --> 1193.17
that he doesn't accept optics he doesn't

1189.78 --> 1195.09
accept citations books and original you

1193.17 --> 1197.16
know paper world he said like the only

1195.09 --> 1199.02
thing is gonna convince him is show him

1197.16 --> 1201.3300000000002
bendy water or a gas pressure or

1199.02 --> 1204.36
container I don't see that as a as a

1201.33 --> 1206.6399999999999
good argument you know for anybody that

1204.36 --> 1207.9299999999998
because me aflutter that if I wanna go

1206.64 --> 1209.7900000000002
over there and say yeah I caught some

1207.93 --> 1211.71
really cool footage he's gonna shut me

1209.79 --> 1213.69
down he said you got nothing foolish can

1211.71 --> 1215.91
be manipulated can be CGI or whatever so

1213.69 --> 1220.3500000000001
I don't know Adam I don't appreciate

1215.91 --> 1221.97
that at all together I feel as though he

1220.35 --> 1224.01
treats me I don't have all the people

1221.97 --> 1225.3
but my own perception is that he treats

1224.01 --> 1228.36
me worse than he treats some of the

1225.3 --> 1229.68
ballers all right half the ballers some

1228.36 --> 1230.9699999999998
of the ball is where he talks to them he

1229.68 --> 1232.5
actually has a conversation and better

1230.97 --> 1234.54
be there and then he does with me and

1232.5 --> 1235.92
I'm on I'm on the face side of hood and

1234.54 --> 1238.02
it's like why am I getting treated so

1235.92 --> 1240.0500000000002
badly and I mean I'll give you an

1238.02 --> 1242.46
example when he came into Nathan's Show

1240.05 --> 1243.72
yeah he made the point I can't remember

1242.46 --> 1245.19
what the point was now but I asked him

1243.72 --> 1246.72
where did you get that point from it was

1245.19 --> 1249.39
it his own creation or did someone tell

1246.72 --> 1250.68
him and then initially head bother

1249.39 --> 1252.63
himself and then he said actually it

1250.68 --> 1255.24
would golf that told it me and I said

1252.63 --> 1258.0
well pass on our or agree that's a great

1255.24 --> 1261.33
great point and he basically spat at me

1258.0 --> 1263.37
by saying that it was on the and for

1261.33 --> 1264.1499999999999
credited in golf and not sucking his

1263.37 --> 1266.2199999999998
dick at the same time

1264.15 --> 1267.96
and I'm like well think so you just said

1266.22 --> 1275.67
it was came it came from that gap and

1267.96 --> 1278.22
all I'm doing is acknowledging golf yes

1275.67 --> 1280.23
somebody that I appreciate is a vegan

1278.22 --> 1282.15
warrior appreciate vegan warrior because

1280.23 --> 1284.85
he can have a conversation he can have a

1282.15 --> 1285.69
discussion and he can entertain anything

1284.85 --> 1287.519
you know he can

1285.69 --> 1290.009
you talk and then he talked he was but

1287.519 --> 1294.0
as for Dale he just shot everybody down

1290.009 --> 1295.98
is what he says or else and I really

1294.0 --> 1301.2
don't like that [ __ ] in a [ __ ]

1295.98 --> 1304.25
I don't just did I did I swear than are

1301.2 --> 1309.8700000000001
we what we really put into me yeah

1304.25 --> 1317.159
just don't get too smutty please I'm

1309.87 --> 1319.4399999999998
sorry but that's forget it come on you

1317.159 --> 1326.5390000000002
were just getting very descriptive about

1319.44 --> 1326.539
certain sexual things oh yeah you know

1326.6 --> 1331.86
yeah after yesterday I get okay Nathan

1329.669 --> 1337.0490000000002
does go that far but it's just part of

1331.86 --> 1345.899
his thing but I prefer not so smutty

1337.049 --> 1349.47
ness anyway yeah keep it up I it's good

1345.899 --> 1352.9799999999998
that you have met face to face with

1349.47 --> 1357.1200000000001
Kenneth and these guys and that's going

1352.98 --> 1360.21
good and also yeah del I kind of agree

1357.12 --> 1362.1899999999998
with you and I just I don't know I just

1360.21 --> 1363.8700000000001
don't see him with that much as an

1362.19 --> 1365.6100000000001
influencer you know if he just makes

1363.87 --> 1367.559
enemies everywhere people are just gonna

1365.61 --> 1370.11
kick him away and if he's been pranked

1367.559 --> 1372.72
to suck up to be friends again or

1370.11 --> 1375.24
whatever gets some attention well yeah

1372.72 --> 1379.049
then people eventually will catch on to

1375.24 --> 1381.389
that happening all the time and you know

1379.049 --> 1383.94
you'll just end up isolating himself so

1381.389 --> 1386.549
I'm not really worried about del del

1383.94 --> 1390.299
just does what he does and but after

1386.549 --> 1393.69
whatever he chooses yeah he will reap

1390.299 --> 1396.289
what he shows so that's how he's

1393.69 --> 1400.049
isolated himself already owes me hmm

1396.289 --> 1402.1
he's isolating himself already that's up

1400.049 --> 1406.05
to him now

1402.1 --> 1411.82
maybe he has a winter mood too and just

1406.05 --> 1413.77
pushing everyone away no it's clear it

1411.82 --> 1415.96
says the globe EDS are trying to build a

1578.79 --> 1584.42
little while and maybe a big wide room

1581.13 --> 1584.42
or something and chill out

1585.53 --> 1589.1499999999999

2042.779 --> 2053.82
don't need to like you know talk about

2044.37 --> 2055.109
whether or not you can see the curve you

2053.82 --> 2055.889
know you know he's no standing issue

2055.109 --> 2058.98
week so right

2055.889 --> 2060.629
what's that you know what their

2058.98 --> 2061.889
conspiracy capped out standing issue is

2060.629 --> 2063.24
you know Paul Voight's the one that's

2061.889 --> 2065.3990000000003
gotta prove that was a molten iron core

2063.24 --> 2066.9289999999996
what conspiracy cats has gotta prove

2065.399 --> 2068.8199999999997
that there's a gas pressure possible

2066.929 --> 2072.3
next to a vacuum without some kind of

2068.82 --> 2073.679
membrane he's gotta prove that one only

2072.3 --> 2075.179
Athens because he knows that well he

2073.679 --> 2078.149
claims that Nathan's meat buttons the

2075.179 --> 2085.29
issue and I'm like well whatever needs

2078.149 --> 2088.44
to prove somebody something Louis with a

2085.29 --> 2091.82
voice changer and the other guy sounds

2088.44 --> 2094.26
like LaVon with a voice changer a Waze

2091.82 --> 2096.1490000000003
then there's the other guy was the one

2094.26 --> 2097.9500000000003
guy who sounds like Lewis he was talking

2096.149 --> 2100.44
about Eminem's in a bag and I was like

2097.95 --> 2103.1699999999996
yeah nobody brought up the fact that

2100.44 --> 2105.03
there's a bag involved you know and I

2103.17 --> 2107.099
mean like and like just all these

2105.03 --> 2115.2900000000004
interesting little I just I love these

2107.099 --> 2118.23
arguments like you know yeah he bring

2115.29 --> 2119.7599999999998
Eminem's Hey look here with that's fine

2118.23 --> 2121.29
bring Eminem's into the equation the

2119.76 --> 2123.2000000000003
point is you also got Eminem's in a bag

2121.29 --> 2125.97
and there's like you know so it's like

2123.2 --> 2127.5
it's just so many variables and such

2125.97 --> 2129.9599999999996
interesting stuff to think about it

2127.5 --> 2134.46
Sharon but like some people can't handle

2129.96 --> 2137.29
that that thought process

2134.46 --> 2139.33
you know what it wasn't our styling

2137.29 --> 2141.82
sentence the mark of a wise man to

2139.33 --> 2143.85
entertain two opposing ideas and accept

2141.82 --> 2146.8300000000004
neither

2143.85 --> 2152.08
yeah he also he also believed that life

2146.83 --> 2154.5699999999997
to grow out of mud so what the that life

2152.08 --> 2159.13
could grow out of mud huh

2154.57 --> 2161.23
iris tall yeah yeah he was a geocentric

2159.13 --> 2166.11
wasn't he got superseded by Aristophanes

2161.23 --> 2166.11
and then but became became a healer

2169.23 --> 2173.35
Aristophanes wasn't that the sticks and

2171.58 --> 2176.35
they got in the ground guy yeah yeah

2173.35 --> 2178.8399999999997
yeah that's not Aristotle Aristotle was

2176.35 --> 2180.25
the geocentrism comes from Aristotle and

2178.84 --> 2183.46
that's what we still get taught our only

2180.25 --> 2186.97
and it was superseded by Aristophanes

2183.46 --> 2189.16
and stick in a graphical and then

2186.97 --> 2193.23
heliocentric was born as a result of

2189.16 --> 2195.49
Copernicus so Aristotle resides and pick

2193.23 --> 2197.83
our startled jumped sides and became a

2195.49 --> 2206.89
capper kaput the Copernicus priest

2197.83 --> 2209.83
spreading the good word Socrates and

2206.89 --> 2211.12
Plato they're the three missionaries

2209.83 --> 2211.7799999999997
that were spreading the word of

2211.12 --> 2213.6099999999997
Kaepernick

2211.78 --> 2217.38
okay so but according sent what signee

2213.61 --> 2220.7200000000003
talking about Aristotle was beefy I

2217.38 --> 2222.31
would start old Plato and Socrates all

2220.72 --> 2223.87
right yeah we're all be seasoned

2222.31 --> 2225.58
O'Reilly right but they didn't jump but

2223.87 --> 2232.63
they couldn't jump on the Copernican

2225.58 --> 2234.43
trade it's the furniture thing you know

2232.63 --> 2236.32
but I think that they have been wrecked

2234.43 --> 2239.1099999999997
they were basically stumbling on a

2236.32 --> 2241.7200000000003
similar type of startup of that thought

2239.11 --> 2244.54
process they kind of discovered it

2241.72 --> 2248.0499999999997
philosophically and then later

2244.54 --> 2252.37
their work was basically in used as

2248.05 --> 2255.61
inspiration to build the the

2252.37 --> 2258.88
presuppositional system using astronomy

2255.61 --> 2260.11
and geometry Pilate with them were dick

2258.88 --> 2262.42
better because the point is the fact

2260.11 --> 2264.25
they didn't jump on the Copernican train

2262.42 --> 2265.53
Copernicus maybe jumped on their

2264.25 --> 2269.22
philosophical train

2265.53 --> 2272.3
exactly xa the other way around makes it

2269.22 --> 2272.2999999999997
sound like a stork

2273.47 --> 2279.18
morning fellas

2275.01 --> 2289.9500000000003
hey good my funny joke is that yeah

2279.18 --> 2292.56
what's up man everybody so yeah they

2289.95 --> 2295.0499999999997
built this foundation and right now the

2292.56 --> 2297.09
modern time science they keep building

2295.05 --> 2299.8500000000004
and keep building on it on the

2297.09 --> 2302.9700000000003
foundation it's been laid for us for us

2299.85 --> 2305.7
from the back in the day you know it has

2302.97 --> 2309.2999999999997
to be a spinning ball with this way

2305.7 --> 2310.74
freakin orbits and [ __ ] you know and we

2309.3 --> 2312.1800000000003
keep building I mean the the modern

2310.74 --> 2313.3199999999997
science keep building and building they

2312.18 --> 2314.73
don't want to entertain nothing else

2313.32 --> 2315.8700000000003
because they don't want to start from

2314.73 --> 2320.19
scratch they want to keep throwing

2315.87 --> 2323.3399999999997
layers and layers to this model right

2320.19 --> 2326.76
and they want new grounds for investment

2323.34 --> 2330.77
like China is now delving into the dark

2326.76 --> 2334.59
side of the moon look all this new and

2330.77 --> 2339.32
checkable region that yeah you can

2334.59 --> 2339.32
invest in basically in new projects

2340.18 --> 2349.72
you heard about the shadow right back

2342.16 --> 2358.48
side of the nerd yeah what a close call

2349.72 --> 2361.0299999999997
guys did you think it squeak we really

2358.48 --> 2363.46
[ __ ] squeaked by that one

2361.03 --> 2369.67
what about China's moon London supposed

2363.46 --> 2377.079
to be on the back of the moon we send

2369.67 --> 2379.3
the images yes yes I am sure no you know

2377.079 --> 2381.4900000000002
that Google told us we have to believe

2379.3 --> 2388.27
everything China said is that what they

2381.49 --> 2390.64
say right well one thing that really

2388.27 --> 2391.45
stood out for me is that it is even

2390.64 --> 2394.15
being reported

2391.45 --> 2395.8289999999997
ANBU Dutch News and then you get to see

2394.15 --> 2397.48
like oh yeah this happened first you see

2395.829 --> 2399.7000000000003
some picture of the so-called moon

2397.48 --> 2402.13
surface then they show you the animation

2399.7 --> 2407.109
of the landing that it Chinese forwarded

2402.13 --> 2410.92
which is like really basic like maybe

2407.109 --> 2413.5589999999997
like 2005 level CGI of the thing and

2410.92 --> 2415.809
then they do the animation again but

2413.559 --> 2418.2400000000002
from the Dutch studio with much more

2415.809 --> 2424.1400000000003
sophisticated 3d animation the so they

2418.24 --> 2426.7599999999998
shall see it's like this crappy version

2424.14 --> 2428.47
this is what it really should look like

2426.76 --> 2434.2000000000003
it is supposed to be the first moon

2428.47 --> 2436.24
landing since the 17th it is hold on

2434.2 --> 2438.1899999999996
hold on hold on I think there is an

2436.24 --> 2440.859
option to these people to basically

2438.19 --> 2444.7000000000003
start declaring that this is the first

2440.859 --> 2447.64
real moon landing that's the political

2444.7 --> 2449.95
angle to it know how real it is if it's

2447.64 --> 2452.44
the first moon landing after the 70s

2449.95 --> 2455.74
since the Americans they they did like a

2452.44 --> 2457.9
like a report news in the NASA website

2455.74 --> 2460.1189999999997
when it is happening a few years ago

2457.9 --> 2461.77
like a 30 snake on this side oh yeah by

2460.119 --> 2463.809
the way China landed on the moon this is

2461.77 --> 2465.49
one picture of it they never they never

2463.809 --> 2468.549
mention it again they never showed it

2465.49 --> 2469.9599999999996
again in NASA how you know right yeah

2468.549 --> 2471.549
what's cool is like they landed on the

2469.96 --> 2472.31
dark side of the moon so that we

2471.549 --> 2476.96
couldn't say

2472.31 --> 2478.34
what we couldn't do it right like they

2476.96 --> 2482.36
land on with our cousin one so you

2478.34 --> 2484.3700000000003
couldn't but yeah and not only not film

2482.36 --> 2486.44
it you can't see it in telescope so it's

2484.37 --> 2490.13
completely concealed its genius its

2486.44 --> 2494.12
genius it's an untraceable spot it's out

2490.13 --> 2496.34
of sight officially so they can just do

2494.12 --> 2497.75
whatever and no risk I call it fake

2496.34 --> 2499.13
because you can't see it yeah you

2497.75 --> 2511.46
couldn't see it because it's on the

2499.13 --> 2513.53
other side of the moon I think you know

2511.46 --> 2515.7200000000003
that way that there is all the stuff

2513.53 --> 2517.5800000000004
that is there any stuff like everyone

2515.72 --> 2519.56
wants to terribly anything down and

2517.58 --> 2521.06
stuff but I don't think that that's the

2519.56 --> 2528.74
move it's just teach your children how

2521.06 --> 2531.95
to think fantasy fairy tale it is like

2528.74 --> 2533.66
Santa Claus but with the cosmos do you

2531.95 --> 2536.0899999999997
know what's really funny about this this

2533.66 --> 2539.69
a Chinese thing is that essentially

2536.09 --> 2543.17
they've given the same lunar lander is

2539.69 --> 2547.46
the the Apollo landings it's an almost

2543.17 --> 2548.69
identical you know tweak a whole you

2547.46 --> 2552.41
saying that they just drugged it out the

2548.69 --> 2553.67
prop core didn't use it again I know I

2552.41 --> 2558.58
know what this is

2553.67 --> 2558.58
they bootleg the American version

2559.75 --> 2563.24
they've even got it with the same you

2562.91 --> 2565.58
know

2563.24 --> 2569.24
legs on it and everything wrapped in

2565.58 --> 2575.33
tinfoil his hood joke so they literally

2569.24 --> 2579.83
bootleg did it that is so typical what

2575.33 --> 2581.86
you expect made in China I picked up

2579.83 --> 2586.36
smart they could sleep like got fine

2581.86 --> 2586.36
officer yeah I long made it to the moon

2586.57 --> 2590.4100000000003
doctor Chinese Mel

2590.779 --> 2604.589
also I'm - and bring some images of it

2593.599 --> 2606.7490000000003
when I win you want to watch a good

2604.589 --> 2610.95
indoctrination movie I watched one

2606.749 --> 2614.3089999999997
yesterday the Cloverfield paradox it was

2610.95 --> 2616.9199999999996
like 90% in in an space station like an

2614.309 --> 2618.3590000000004
International Space Station and they

2616.92 --> 2621.4790000000003
were doing all these thing and it was

2618.359 --> 2624.029
ridiculous all these ball earth in the

2621.479 --> 2628.46
scenes and a Space Station [ __ ] it

2624.029 --> 2628.46
was really cool for indoctrinating kids

2642.14 --> 2665.729
okay thank you see you later I might

2657.42 --> 2669.329
come back a little bit cool right okay

2665.729 --> 2671.609
so can you see this images of the far

2669.329 --> 2674.5190000000002
side of the Moon captured by a Chinese

2671.609 --> 2676.0789999999997
probe and with that China has made

2674.519 --> 2679.2
history yeah you gotta tell me the first

2676.079 --> 2681.2690000000002
ever landing in that area the touchdown

2679.2 --> 2683.1899999999996
of the channel 4 probe is the most

2681.269 --> 2689.5789999999997
significant success of a Chinese space

2683.19 --> 2692.099
program so far it aims to catch up with

2689.579 --> 2694.049
or even surpass the US and Russia in the

2692.099 --> 2697.619
next decade by building a lunar powers

2694.049 --> 2699.45
and sending probes and Rovers to Mars so

2697.619 --> 2705.21
what's driving China's space mission oh

2699.45 --> 2707.2189999999996
why is it making the u.s. so uneasy I'm

2705.21 --> 2710.489
not gonna show the entire video I might

2707.219 --> 2712.2290000000003
get copyright strike but yeah you got a

2710.489 --> 2713.81
little picture let me just see if I can

2712.229 --> 2717.89
ooh

2713.81 --> 2722.57
the president ah is this it no there you

2717.89 --> 2725.48
go look at earth Oh what is that really

2722.57 --> 2727.76
meant to be me a lot this is now this is

2725.48 --> 2728.6
a CGI representation of what it's

2727.76 --> 2731.03
supposed to look like

2728.6 --> 2735.44
oh I'll be broken down into hydrogen and

2731.03 --> 2739.8100000000004
oxygen and used as rock yeah but what

2735.44 --> 2742.25
you know real because it looks so fake

2739.81 --> 2745.34
who took the images of the man on the

2742.25 --> 2747.49
moon now but this is not over this is

2745.34 --> 2753.56
officially according to them a CGI

2747.49 --> 2755.2099999999996
representation now this and now what

2753.56 --> 2758.86
you're seeing right now is an actual

2755.21 --> 2764.3
rocket launch but these things are all

2758.86 --> 2766.36
CGI I couldn't tell what's real what's

2764.3 --> 2766.36
fake

2771.13 --> 2779.289
author and strategic analyst cool she

2774.13 --> 2785.19
wrote a book Protectorate do Mirada goes

2779.289 --> 2785.19
Ronnie to now now we're back to reality

2787.95 --> 2801.27
Oh Oh see that graphical simulation by

2795.9 --> 2802.859
NASA see yeah because there's no

2801.27 --> 2808.02
satellite that can take that picture of

2802.859 --> 2810.5699999999997
the ISS and earth in the background you

2808.02 --> 2811.28
know it must be fake because it looks so

2810.57 --> 2813.78
real

2811.28 --> 2815.4900000000002
but where's that satellite that took the

2813.78 --> 2817.7000000000003
other footage of the moon behind the

2815.49 --> 2822.06
earth supposedly a million miles away

2817.7 --> 2824.1299999999997
epic chocolate just just see this just

2822.06 --> 2826.7999999999997
see what you're looking at see how real

2824.13 --> 2829.4300000000003
this looks and it's right there these

2826.8 --> 2833.79
graphics em you can take it all it

2829.43 --> 2838.0789999999997
this is admittedly in your face faked by

2833.79 --> 2841.079
them right now here in whew so what the

2838.079 --> 2846.599
[ __ ] this is really real looking I

2841.079 --> 2848.579
couldn't tell well the unless I just say

2846.599 --> 2851.099
it's it this can't be possible of course

2848.579 --> 2853.05
but this looks incredibly real they

2851.099 --> 2857.369
didn't even fisheye lens

2853.05 --> 2859.1400000000003
the panel yeah it's this is incredible

2857.369 --> 2861.109
but they say this is a simulation this

2859.14 --> 2865.859
is not real

2861.109 --> 2867.8289999999997
so yes mind-boggling that if they can

2865.859 --> 2871.2
make a simulation that looks this real

2867.829 --> 2873.69
how would you ever be able to tell what

2871.2 --> 2876.66
is not real unless you just trust them

2873.69 --> 2879.14
to tell you already you told me that's

2876.66 --> 2882.93
not real yeah

2879.14 --> 2885.5989999999997
they say it's not real but the ISS is

2882.93 --> 2888.24
real no but this what you're seeing

2885.599 --> 2891.3590000000004
right here is a graphical simulation by

2888.24 --> 2893.97
NASA so this is in simulation they're

2891.359 --> 2899.869
that good at faking the real things

2893.97 --> 2903.0
apparently ISS ISS where's my SS bomb

2899.869 --> 2905.6400000000003
well it's supposedly still out there but

2903.0 --> 2907.89
what you're seeing right here is a 3d

2905.64 --> 2911.0989999999997
animation probably or something in that

2907.89 --> 2913.02
lawyer and just when the globus was

2911.099 --> 2914.79
showing this and saying this is the ISS

2913.02 --> 2915.9
and we're saying well who took the image

2914.79 --> 2918.119
and then well

2915.9 --> 2919.6800000000003
there they've got technology to do this

2918.119 --> 2922.71
and then they absolutely said it's a

2919.68 --> 2927.27
graphical representation yep graphical

2922.71 --> 2929.279
simulation so cuz in 2018 we can't get

2927.27 --> 2933.559
HD cameras all over the place right

2929.279 --> 2939.42
oh this was actually posted in 2019

2933.559 --> 2941.52
think today okay so yeah indicating

2939.42 --> 2943.65
opposed allele and what he gave poor

2941.52 --> 2946.5
clouds in they've even put clouds in

2943.65 --> 2947.2200000000003
this graphical simulation yeah it's

2946.5 --> 2951.839
pretty damn good

2947.22 --> 2954.089
why would because of that trouble cuz

2951.839 --> 2958.41
they probably heard way too many times

2954.089 --> 2960.779
there are no clouds well maybe they took

2958.41 --> 2963.0
some note of that the actual footage of

2960.779 --> 2966.559
how it's a real look really high up is

2963.0 --> 2970.47
like one big ball of cloud so maybe they

2966.559 --> 2972.9900000000002
isn't they're starting to wake up to a

2970.47 --> 2979.9199999999996
more realistic presuppositional system

2972.99 --> 2982.0789999999997
good eat anyway yeah the funny things

2979.92 --> 2984.559
you bump into when you go looking and

2982.079 --> 2987.48
pay attention

2984.559 --> 2992.4900000000002
okay I'm gonna present now let's get

2987.48 --> 2997.039
back but yeah the this the the moon

2992.49 --> 3002.1989999999996
lander look very familiar didn't it oh

2997.039 --> 3005.4990000000003
wow even more realistic looking

3002.199 --> 3005.4990000000003
just kidding

3005.769 --> 3014.3799999999997
so you guys still there

3010.329 --> 3014.38
yep right yeah

3015.63 --> 3021.7490000000003
yeah and that works well I'm you yeah

3019.16 --> 3025.14
landing on the back of the moon doing

3021.749 --> 3027.299
whatever also they said it was ace

3025.14 --> 3032.009
yeah even on the news on the Dutch news

3027.299 --> 3034.949
they said it was a smart move to to go

3032.009 --> 3037.349
one step further into eventually going

3034.949 --> 3039.779
to Mars so they're suggesting okay

3037.349 --> 3043.079
they're gonna use the backside of the

3039.779 --> 3046.289
moon as a in-between station to get to

3043.079 --> 3049.319
Mars yeah obviously no we're on the

3046.289 --> 3054.529
backside and they were gonna install a

3049.319 --> 3060.529
moon orbiting satellite also as a

3054.529 --> 3062.43
communication are they who the garbage I

3060.529 --> 3071.039
thought it was pretty interesting

3062.43 --> 3073.109
science fiction but yeah well on the

3071.039 --> 3077.3900000000003
other hand seriously if there is gonna

3073.109 --> 3083.39
be a satellite orbiting the moon then

3077.39 --> 3086.729
shouldn't that become visible occasions

3083.39 --> 3089.1299999999997
pass in front of side of the Moon if

3086.729 --> 3092.1299999999997
it's looking it's going around it's not

3089.13 --> 3093.869
just hovering but if we have all these

3092.13 --> 3095.9100000000003
satellites up there already why don't

3093.869 --> 3098.609
why aren't there a bunch of satellites

3095.91 --> 3100.709
orbiting just a moment yeah they never

3098.609 --> 3103.4
ever transit the full face of the Moon

3100.709 --> 3103.3999999999996
ever

3103.709 --> 3109.259
my name's well I don't know we can't see

3105.93 --> 3111.66
the far side of the Moon why haven't you

3109.259 --> 3114.68
seen why is there not I mean all right

3111.66 --> 3119.0389999999998
yeah they're supposedly in that epic

3114.68 --> 3122.519
nonsensical footage but I mean come on

3119.039 --> 3125.1600000000003
why aren't there three four maybe 20

3122.519 --> 3126.479
satellites just on the moon itself with

3125.16 --> 3130.019
all the satellites they got up there

3126.479 --> 3134.279
really I got another one for you in that

3130.019 --> 3137.43
note if the moon supposedly on a daily

3134.279 --> 3138.719
basis as a gravity pole that actually

3137.43 --> 3141.56
causes the tides

3138.719 --> 3144.23
then why don't the satellites

3141.56 --> 3146.63
get sucked up and just crash in the moon

3144.23 --> 3157.45
when that happens they're much closer

3146.63 --> 3157.4500000000003
oh so silly isn't it

3162.13 --> 3169.4790000000003
yeah guys I've been going for an hour I

3166.979 --> 3172.3289999999997
was thinking maybe rounding out the show

3169.479 --> 3174.5789999999997
unless you have more subjects to delve

3172.329 --> 3177.369
into or want to get into it a discussion

3174.579 --> 3183.7290000000003
maybe I could invite a baller just to

3177.369 --> 3185.319
spy some things up what do you say I'm

3183.729 --> 3186.66
already more than one on to be honest I

3185.319 --> 3193.41
don't mind

3186.66 --> 3193.41
alright ok I will put the link out

3194.279 --> 3203.009
conspiracy can you're gonna put the link

3197.17 --> 3203.009
out no no no not in the in sky bunny

3214.89 --> 3220.95
oh man I got so many new contact Oh God

3218.58 --> 3226.29
even Louis Hackett said he wants to go

3220.95 --> 3228.8999999999996
on Jesus either time wait well most of

3226.29 --> 3234.17
them are yeah

3228.9 --> 3237.48
well he's like one of the worst yeah I

3234.17 --> 3244.13
don't know I could get moss back on he's

3237.48 --> 3246.68
always pretty drilled hmm is that okay

3244.13 --> 3253.9500000000003
was wasn't maybe a little bit

3246.68 --> 3256.1099999999997
no salt out saucy sauce too much sauce

3253.95 --> 3257.46
I'll wait drink out of the night time

3256.11 --> 3260.3700000000003
mm-hmm

3257.46 --> 3265.14
maybe I don't know I don't know if he's

3260.37 --> 3267.83
even online good I don't think he's

3265.14 --> 3267.83
online right now

3327.78 --> 3334.4700000000003
some PhD physicist lecturer University

3331.7 --> 3337.7999999999997
so somebody with more credentials than

3334.47 --> 3340.0789999999997
these globe trolls that come in debate

3337.8 --> 3341.46
didn't like a pattern like questions

3340.079 --> 3343.4100000000003
already set for debate

3341.46 --> 3344.819
yeah I've given him the questions I'll

3343.41 --> 3346.5
be asking super job provide the evidence

3344.819 --> 3348.3
for and I've been really really specific

3346.5 --> 3349.619
so I'm not gonna pull a rabbit out of a

3348.3 --> 3351.329
hat or last minute I'm gonna ask them

3349.619 --> 3353.04
the exact questions I asked him but all

3351.329 --> 3355.53
to do with base to the housekeeping

3353.04 --> 3357.66
gravity at civilization okay gas

3355.53 --> 3362.13
pressure without without membrane of

3357.66 --> 3363.5989999999997
some kind all that canister how long was

3362.13 --> 3366.96
this debate well it's a last you know

3363.599 --> 3368.6400000000003
don't know he's telling me to let the

3366.96 --> 3372.06
cats on they're all pushing me

3368.64 --> 3375.3289999999997
good catching good catchin me nuts a

3372.06 --> 3375.96
home health car I'm not gonna do it but

3375.329 --> 3378.96
it's just

3375.96 --> 3384.66
god damn it they're all whining to me to

3378.96 --> 3386.9
let freakin cats but not this one so let

3384.66 --> 3386.8999999999996
Amon

3390.569 --> 3393.95
Nathan on let's see if you then come on

3396.8 --> 3401.3100000000004
no but I think I'm just gonna round out

3399.78 --> 3403.36
the show we've been going for an hour

3401.31 --> 3406.95
it's been pretty good we talked

3403.36 --> 3410.05
several things and I think Nathan is

3406.95 --> 3411.8199999999997
premiering something

3410.05 --> 3414.61
the trouble with cats is he just wants

3411.82 --> 3416.8300000000004
content for his next video and all's it

3414.61 --> 3420.4
is is hit pieces every video that he's

3416.83 --> 3422.2
ever put out is injured piece so when

3420.4 --> 3423.79
he's doing when he's when he's wanting

3422.2 --> 3424.96
to come on he's doing it for an angle

3423.79 --> 3426.07
he's doing it for a reason he'll be

3424.96 --> 3428.05
looking for a sound bite

3426.07 --> 3430.06
it'll be looking for some kind of gotcha

3428.05 --> 3431.8300000000004
moment something that he couldn't save

3430.06 --> 3434.68
and then he can release it as a video

3431.83 --> 3436.42
and there's no benefit in it because

3434.68 --> 3438.8799999999997
he's not here for a debate he's not here

3436.42 --> 3441.48
for answers he's here to get his next

3438.88 --> 3443.86
video clip that's what he's here for

3441.48 --> 3446.53
