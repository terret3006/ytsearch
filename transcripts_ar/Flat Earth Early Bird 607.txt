yesterday stayed up until 4:00 and

179.79 --> 187.35999999999999
because I got kind of gripped by new

182.14 --> 189.48
series and it was pretty good so yeah I

187.36 --> 191.89000000000001
keep surprised by a series that are

189.48 --> 193.14999999999998
still around on Netflix that it will

191.89 --> 194.79999999999998
appeal to me and this one was

193.15 --> 198.16
recommended although I don't remember

194.8 --> 204.91000000000003
for sure who did it but I was being what

198.16 --> 208.209
I've been watching glitch and yeah it's

204.91 --> 211.29999999999998
it's a concept series very much

208.209 --> 214.69
surrounding characters and I really like

211.3 --> 218.739
it it's like a piece of Australian

214.69 --> 221.459
history as it were and yeah the

218.739 --> 224.26
characters in there are really

221.459 --> 225.94
fascinating like especially the

224.26 --> 229.7
[Music]

225.94 --> 231.26
the man of the old block everybody yeah

229.7 --> 233.29
everybody that knows the series will

231.26 --> 235.88
know who that is

233.29 --> 238.97
like I think he's one of the oldest

235.88 --> 240.41
people as it were you'll figure out what

238.97 --> 244.13
that means I'm not gonna spoil anything

240.41 --> 246.10999999999999
about it until people yeah get into that

244.13 --> 251.03
but it's it's a pretty good series and

246.11 --> 254.45000000000002
it's very Australian and I like it so

251.03 --> 258.11
far I'm like a episode 5 I think or 6

254.45 --> 261.40999999999997
it's great definitely gonna be enjoying

258.11 --> 269.39
that also because it's it's it's kind of

261.41 --> 275.5
lied back and I like that it's just a

269.39 --> 277.78999999999996
lot of time to basically enjoyed it yeah

275.5 --> 282.89
one of the bigger advantages of

277.79 --> 287.15000000000003
Australia big houses and just a lot of

282.89 --> 291.08
out and spice and I like that sorry I'll

287.15 --> 301.72999999999996
stop doing that now but I appreciate the

291.08 --> 304.4
series also yeah a movie getting really

301.73 --> 306.98
stupid now not remembering the net just

304.4 --> 308.56
anyway it's a start of the show so yeah

306.98 --> 311.96000000000004
everybody should be expecting that

308.56 --> 314.35
completely forget names because I didn't

311.96 --> 314.34999999999997
write it down

323.31 --> 330.48
right was it that one was that one no

327.68 --> 346.82
I'm just gonna IMDB it because this is

330.48 --> 352.14000000000004
ridiculous that I don't remember right

346.82 --> 355.77
okay there you go yeah it was a 2018

352.14 --> 361.07
movie the week off with Adam Sandler and

355.77 --> 365.84999999999997
Chris Rock and it was it was about I

361.07 --> 367.68
think small had culture in a kind of a

365.85 --> 369.96000000000004
neutral way I don't know this seems to

367.68 --> 374.73
be kind of a thing with with Adam

369.96 --> 376.73999999999995
Sandler and yeah it was really another

374.73 --> 379.65000000000003
one of those I thought it was freaking

376.74 --> 383.27
hilarious and like sneaky and I don't

379.65 --> 386.64
know I thought it was funny and crazy

383.27 --> 390.24
cuz that guy just keeps on inviting

386.64 --> 393.57
people in when there's blink like it's

390.24 --> 399.84000000000003
very big yeah his home basically turns

393.57 --> 401.96999999999997
into this household of young stain I

399.84 --> 403.71
don't know it's like overcrowded gets

401.97 --> 405.84000000000003
all knotty but it still kind of works

403.71 --> 410.13
it's it's funny what he did in that

405.84 --> 414.33
movie I thought anyway it reminds me a

410.13 --> 416.07
little bit certain details about how

414.33 --> 419.72999999999996
things went with my parents as well

416.07 --> 421.71
though it's was never this blatant but

419.73 --> 424.71000000000004
they also had a weird habit to sometimes

421.71 --> 427.79999999999995
just pull a lot of people into the house

424.71 --> 429.03
that I didn't know about but like didn't

427.8 --> 430.44
know anything about it was just kind of

429.03 --> 432.09
young it but it still yeah that

430.44 --> 434.46
sometimes haven't and then the entire

432.09 --> 438.9
house just turned into like a party but

434.46 --> 441.69
not like like adults acting still

438.9 --> 445.22999999999996
normally it's not like crazy crazy party

441.69 --> 448.849
but yeah it's just funny reminded me

445.23 --> 455.119
about way back a lil

448.849 --> 456.05
and gay robot are you talking about Ari

455.119 --> 463.869
macGruber

456.05 --> 463.869
Oh Orochimaru I have here pronounce it

464.679 --> 474.60999999999996
you never told me I asked you yeah

479.12 --> 489.86
all right anyway that was kind of what I

482.9 --> 490.669
was doing yesterday yeah there was no Oh

489.86 --> 495.04
Benjamin

490.669 --> 499.46
none of it no no it's weird I even had

495.04 --> 501.77000000000004
the life open till very late and then I

499.46 --> 504.13899999999995
noticed that crow triple7 went life

501.77 --> 505.69899999999996
didn't really watch that because it was

504.139 --> 516.909
way too late and I went to bed after

505.699 --> 516.909
that it's a skit okay like a comedy skit

522.59 --> 528.62
right anyway yeah the movie the week of

526.58 --> 530.57
what I've thought was kind of

528.62 --> 535.67
spectacular about it is that they got

530.57 --> 540.47
like every type so I'd caricature but

535.67 --> 542.68
still like like seriously like it I

540.47 --> 546.65
can't explain it

542.68 --> 548.12
you have to see it to believe it I don't

546.65 --> 551.27
know I thought it was freaking hilarious

548.12 --> 554.089
and just like ah cringe-worthy too at

551.27 --> 557.5889999999999
times it's just but that's just what

554.089 --> 557.589
that is anyway

561.17 --> 567.529
like especially yeah I'll spoiler that

564.86 --> 570.95
one it's like this big one of the guys

567.529 --> 574.16
and yeah it's like a family like a giant

570.95 --> 576.4100000000001
family parade thing the whole the whole

574.16 --> 579.98
movie and one of the guys is like a

576.41 --> 582.65
surgeon and then he has this habit of

579.98 --> 584.4200000000001
like oh I have to take this the call no

582.65 --> 586.91
matter what and he's always like oh I'm

584.42 --> 589.16
chill he's like you can do anything he's

586.91 --> 590.8389999999999
like he's not fazed by anything and then

589.16 --> 593.12
he takes a call like in the middle of a

590.839 --> 598.22
surgery and I think it like this even

593.12 --> 599.99
reoccurs because it's like this friend

598.22 --> 601.5500000000001
and he will always take the call of this

599.99 --> 603.92
friend but then the friend is kind of

601.55 --> 605.87
like reckless it's like yeah Adam santhu

603.92 --> 609.1999999999999
and he basically hands his the phone to

605.87 --> 613.22
his wife who then starts to just blabber

609.2 --> 617.3000000000001
like a maniac like most unbelievably

613.22 --> 620.6600000000001
stupid [Â __Â ] and like big surgeon guys

617.3 --> 623.4499999999999
basically and he doesn't he doesn't make

620.66 --> 626.92
a mistake by the way that's yeah and

623.45 --> 626.9200000000001
tough but it's like oh my god

628.41 --> 635.0899999999999
yeah they have to see it to believe it I

630.78 --> 638.67
thought it was freaking hilarious anyway

635.09 --> 640.83
hang out in 24/7 Effy discord yeah oh

638.67 --> 642.5699999999999
yeah I have seen you there more around I

640.83 --> 647.4000000000001
I have personally haven't been hanging

642.57 --> 651.3000000000001
around too much there recently I don't

647.4 --> 653.91
know I think that I'm dealing like with

651.3 --> 661.4399999999999
a lot of energy that's kind of changed

653.91 --> 664.0799999999999
and it makes me the last and yeah

661.44 --> 670.5300000000001
let's it makes it less easy for me to

664.08 --> 672.7800000000001
engage I think I don't know maybe it's

670.53 --> 674.5799999999999
just like swing of the pendulum thing

672.78 --> 677.6999999999999
you know because a month ago I was like

674.58 --> 679.35
yeah I'm at it I'm just gonna seek out

677.7 --> 680.97
rooms and start something and they're

679.35 --> 684.9
recorded it and then it kind of like

680.97 --> 687.51
phase out and now I feel more need to

684.9 --> 689.91
basically retract myself and just go

687.51 --> 694.17
into really deep thinking and feeling

689.91 --> 697.05
and trying to somehow get a grip yeah on

694.17 --> 700.5
the interdimensional part of my

697.05 --> 702.9799999999999
experience like and that it's in my mind

700.5 --> 705.57
and that like takes a lot of room to

702.98 --> 710.45
really figure out what the [Â __Â ] is going

705.57 --> 710.45
on with me that is

717.45 --> 724.6800000000001
yeah so I'm just not so much hanging

722.4 --> 727.05
around of seeking out other places and

724.68 --> 728.8499999999999
especially not really I'm just not in

727.05 --> 731.7299999999999
the mood for this attacking anymore and

728.85 --> 735.24
it's kind of funny because yeah I posted

731.73 --> 738.51
a link to a video that Dacian found he

735.24 --> 743.88
always finds these jewels this great guy

738.51 --> 747.39
datian it's very interesting ideas but

743.88 --> 750.78
yeah I posted that I think it's our

747.39 --> 754.1899999999999
dollar but he put down a video that was

750.78 --> 757.9499999999999
just really it we put down the

754.19 --> 760.4100000000001
psychological dichotomy systems in there

757.95 --> 763.1700000000001
really well it's not even too long a

760.41 --> 764.79
video that's why I posted it at a time

763.17 --> 767.16
that yeah if you were around then you

764.79 --> 771.9
could watch the video and still finish

767.16 --> 776.03
it before the start of my show but yeah

771.9 --> 782.55
I'm I'm really I'm kind of sick of the

776.03 --> 784.97
the entak impulses of like this already

782.55 --> 784.9699999999999
occurred

786.8 --> 795.63
responsive no yeah it's reactionary like

792.81 --> 798.1199999999999
the reactionary energy of it I don't

795.63 --> 801.27
like it and I also as I've explained

798.12 --> 807.35
kind of confessed I have it in me and

801.27 --> 807.35
that bothers me John John's back no caps

807.89 --> 813.779
it's your final warning gave AGM the

811.8 --> 824.25
same standard and I'm gonna give it to

813.779 --> 826.98
you no caps right anyway um yeah I have

824.25 --> 829.8
impulses where I basically from the

826.98 --> 835.5600000000001
inside get a lot of anger it's like up

829.8 --> 839.8199999999999
to very dark hatred levels and it's just

835.56 --> 844.02
like I'm not letting it latch on to what

839.82 --> 846.75
I got in order to kind of do something

844.02 --> 852.0
manifest that rage but it is like

846.75 --> 858.39
welling up periodically and it's

852.0 --> 861.0
annoying and apparently like yeah I got

858.39 --> 862.5889999999999
some feedback indirectly because I still

861.0 --> 866.61
have very good hearing and apparently

862.589 --> 869.1600000000001
like my roommate over there as a

866.61 --> 873.36
girlfriend they get very loud and she's

869.16 --> 875.61
kind of giddy in yeah it's very hairy

873.36 --> 877.29
but I forget that sometimes they could

875.61 --> 879.36
be there and when I get really pissed

877.29 --> 880.92
off they'll be hearing it and I won't

879.36 --> 882.9590000000001
realize it and they keep silent about

880.92 --> 886.56
but she was kind of like maybe she was

882.959 --> 888.7199999999999
in a giddy mood and she was emulating my

886.56 --> 892.2299999999999
rage because she thought it was funny

888.72 --> 895.4
but I heard that so it's kind of

892.23 --> 899.91
shocking to hear somebody act that out

895.4 --> 900.66
like [Â __Â ] yeah that yeah that is what

899.91 --> 902.39
that was

900.66 --> 907.49
it's

902.39 --> 909.38
it's not good and right so there's a lot

907.49 --> 913.67
of things out there that are basically

909.38 --> 916.04
trying to trigger that and it's kind of

913.67 --> 918.11
inside of me it wants to be triggered it

916.04 --> 919.43
wants to latch on I don't want it to I

918.11 --> 924.53
want it to go away

919.43 --> 928.5699999999999
and I've appealed to Christ

924.53 --> 931.37
I've appealed to every soothing force

928.57 --> 939.5300000000001
frequency out there and just keeps

931.37 --> 942.5600000000001
coming back and yeah it worries me a

939.53 --> 944.6
little not because I'm afraid that I

942.56 --> 947.0899999999999
will lose control of red and basically

944.6 --> 949.58
do damage and yeah destroy everything

947.09 --> 956.96
that I've tried to build for myself but

949.58 --> 959.75
because I feel it's burning me out all

956.96 --> 962.09
right don't let others get you well it's

959.75 --> 964.76
not look Roche it's that this is not for

962.09 --> 967.82
example about that troll in chat yeah he

964.76 --> 970.28
did get to me I get got back to that but

967.82 --> 971.9000000000001
what that was but that's not really it's

970.28 --> 974.15
not even about person-to-person

971.9 --> 978.41
communication I have that under control

974.15 --> 982.04
most of the time almost perfectly no

978.41 --> 986.5699999999999
it's reactionary it's just bumping into

982.04 --> 989.9
a remark or into a video or such

986.57 --> 991.7
suggestion or just a thing that happens

989.9 --> 993.9499999999999
in-between something you're watching

991.7 --> 996.7700000000001
that you guy didn't see coming it's just

993.95 --> 999.6800000000001
stupid little things so it's it's

996.77 --> 1003.88
reactionary it doesn't it's not even a

999.68 --> 1008.1099999999999
personal person-to-person thing and it

1003.88 --> 1013.59
just it's like it takes me it just Wells

1008.11 --> 1013.59
up like it has this yeah

1014.55 --> 1020.17
and I basically then get so fired up

1017.8 --> 1023.6099999999999
it's like I get adrenaline in me and it

1020.17 --> 1026.29
just needs to be expressed somehow and

1023.61 --> 1032.53
there's like a lot of powerlessness in

1026.29 --> 1040.11
it as well it's almost like yeah my I

1032.53 --> 1040.11
think that maybe my ego is kind of like

1042.57 --> 1048.04
unwilling to adapt but it's crazy

1045.52 --> 1051.27
because it's it's worse than then I

1048.04 --> 1056.8
would suspect it's like I've been

1051.27 --> 1063.87
pushing it half my life and it's kind of

1056.8 --> 1068.61
like ya know I want to undo it all it's

1063.87 --> 1072.61
dramatic and it's like yeah this

1068.61 --> 1075.79
petulant side of me that just is too

1072.61 --> 1082.75
headstrong it just won't listen like

1075.79 --> 1086.11
stop it this but yeah it is like a child

1082.75 --> 1088.51
I am in in my conscious self now an

1086.11 --> 1092.32
adult so I can definitely just say like

1088.51 --> 1095.26
nope I'm not gonna allow you to do

1092.32 --> 1099.27
anything but I am kind of stuck with it

1095.26 --> 1099.27
so yeah that's metaphorical

1104.77 --> 1109.24
but it is someone what it's like and I'm

1106.96 --> 1111.76
just wondering like is there like what

1109.24 --> 1115.44
I've been trying to discuss it with

1111.76 --> 1120.22
other people person yeah for example

1115.44 --> 1124.0
Robin Stanley and she what she suggested

1120.22 --> 1127.1200000000001
that it it's something that I didn't

1124.0 --> 1128.71
even expect or yeah I didn't expect to

1127.12 --> 1131.9799999999998
hear that like she kind of suggested

1128.71 --> 1137.26
like but if it's there then isn't it

1131.98 --> 1139.99
there for a reason isn't it isn't it

1137.26 --> 1142.66
also part of God's plan and just like

1139.99 --> 1147.07
[Â __Â ] that blows my mind like I don't

1142.66 --> 1153.46
understand like I don't I I can't seem

1147.07 --> 1156.61
to it only seems to disrupt so why why

1153.46 --> 1159.13
would that be there in the way and can

1156.61 --> 1163.1499999999999
it is it supposed to be fizzling out why

1159.13 --> 1165.94
is it getting stronger because I think

1163.15 --> 1168.929
it is but maybe that's just because my

1165.94 --> 1171.55
consciousness is reaching wider I'm more

1168.929 --> 1173.17
putting myself out there in the open so

1171.55 --> 1176.29
maybe it is kind of counter weighing

1173.17 --> 1178.21
that it's like oh yeah you want to

1176.29 --> 1181.92
connect well then I'm going to burden

1178.21 --> 1185.28
your you more from the inside with the

1181.92 --> 1188.95
things you are basically suppressing

1185.28 --> 1192.67
about the things you are interconnecting

1188.95 --> 1194.95
with for yourself just to go along to

1192.67 --> 1199.1100000000001
get along one of my favorite

1194.95 --> 1199.1100000000001
terminologies right

1201.549 --> 1207.95
but yeah I want to deal with it because

1203.899 --> 1209.899
I'm not gonna retract I'm not gonna step

1207.95 --> 1217.97
back again I've done that too many times

1209.899 --> 1221.389
in my life I'm sick of it and I think it

1217.97 --> 1227.48
is sick of it too it's just doesn't know

1221.389 --> 1230.9289999999999
any better that part maybe it is almost

1227.48 --> 1234.559
like a personal demon manifested by

1230.929 --> 1237.019
myself and my persistent mistakes so

1234.559 --> 1239.57
it's becoming more personified to be and

1237.019 --> 1240.019
it therefore yeah you can't just drop it

1239.57 --> 1246.95
anymore

1240.019 --> 1249.499
I don't know and with personal demon I

1246.95 --> 1253.039
don't mean an external spirit it's

1249.499 --> 1256.509
definitely a part of me it does feel

1253.039 --> 1261.32
like a part of me and yeah other people

1256.509 --> 1265.6390000000001
they may have experiences like that -

1261.32 --> 1268.1589999999999
for example when they've watch like a

1265.639 --> 1270.08
video or whatever video recording their

1268.159 --> 1273.3790000000001
parents made when they were very little

1270.08 --> 1276.1689999999999
seeing themselves walk around as a

1273.379 --> 1279.6789999999999
little kid they may see that and then

1276.169 --> 1281.6000000000001
like unexpectedly remember certain type

1279.679 --> 1283.8200000000002
of sensations that they only had as a

1281.6 --> 1285.559
kid that they overcome but then they

1283.82 --> 1288.499
kind of remember what it was like just

1285.559 --> 1294.33
by seeing themselves again like that see

1288.499 --> 1302.3500000000001
and yeah

1294.33 --> 1306.549
this is like an old thing that snuck

1302.35 --> 1309.85
there in there as a as a kid and I think

1306.549 --> 1313.539
I even like was worried about it when I

1309.85 --> 1319.6899999999998
was younger like how do i why am i so

1313.539 --> 1323.669
headstrong why am I so stubborn why do I

1319.69 --> 1328.0900000000001
refuse to be corrected and yeah now see

1323.669 --> 1330.7
in retrospect again there is an answer

1328.09 --> 1333.61
to this in the face of what the world is

1330.7 --> 1336.6390000000001
if I hadn't had that that strong impulse

1333.61 --> 1338.889
to basically make me disconnect then I

1336.639 --> 1341.59
probably would have engaged more and

1338.889 --> 1342.879
would have definitely been okay with to

1341.59 --> 1346.629
go along to get along

1342.879 --> 1348.399
and got myself into huge trouble and

1346.629 --> 1353.1689999999999
would never been able to do what I do

1348.399 --> 1356.0189999999998
now so that is the reason but now what

1353.169 --> 1358.21
now now I'm in this position now the

1356.019 --> 1363.629
element that basically allowed this to

1358.21 --> 1363.6290000000001
manifest as it has is it helping

1372.49 --> 1383.32
is there still a reason why this part of

1379.48 --> 1385.57
me that tends to cost me to isolate more

1383.32 --> 1390.33
is there and still a good reason for it

1385.57 --> 1390.33
to be there are the same risks present

1391.14 --> 1400.6000000000001
I'm not sure anyway a Anamika

1398.1 --> 1407.6499999999999
rectangular looping yeah that's right

1400.6 --> 1412.03
John John Mack anyway it's interesting

1407.65 --> 1418.21
too you know because now this is gonna

1412.03 --> 1420.28
get a little weird weird but this first

1418.21 --> 1422.53
happened roughly in the time when I

1420.28 --> 1425.74
started when I discovered Baldur's Gate

1422.53 --> 1428.29
bhavish Gate was kind of like a direct

1425.74 --> 1432.73
post panic thing that happened like I

1428.29 --> 1434.71
started to realize like this Who am I

1432.73 --> 1437.08
what is my place in this world that

1434.71 --> 1440.8
doesn't make it it doesn't fit and then

1437.08 --> 1443.98
Baldur's Gate came out and just that

1440.8 --> 1448.0
story and that experienced like I kind

1443.98 --> 1451.24
of escaped into it very deeply now I'm

1448.0 --> 1453.43
and now I'm talking about escapism that

1451.24 --> 1456.66
even cross the suspense of disbelief

1453.43 --> 1459.3400000000001
borders because yeah extreme distress

1456.66 --> 1460.8400000000001
caused this extreme escapism if you

1459.34 --> 1462.76
don't have any code of conduct to

1460.84 --> 1469.3
protect you from diving that deep yet

1462.76 --> 1471.97
and I basically thought like yeah what

1469.3 --> 1474.07
the character in the game the you

1471.97 --> 1478.95
character does kind of go through it

1474.07 --> 1483.6899999999998
feels very similar it's like you you get

1478.95 --> 1486.5800000000002
dislocated from the world because of

1483.69 --> 1489.28
yeah basically thinks that you were born

1486.58 --> 1494.82
with and that's how I experienced it too

1489.28 --> 1498.82
and it's funny because yeah because of

1494.82 --> 1503.6699999999998
going through that game with that yeah

1498.82 --> 1505.96
that experienced the music directly

1503.67 --> 1509.5
basically triggers

1505.96 --> 1511.1200000000001
very deep energies like very deep it if

1509.5 --> 1514.69
the weird thing is is that in certain

1511.12 --> 1517.809
phases when I literally just didn't want

1514.69 --> 1519.88
yeah when I was just like they what just

1517.809 --> 1524.32
wanted to forget everything because that

1519.88 --> 1526.6000000000001
happened to just couldn't handle even

1524.32 --> 1529.12
yeah basically when I was depressed then

1526.6 --> 1532.649
if I would listen to that it would

1529.12 --> 1535.299
terrify me because it was actually a

1532.649 --> 1538.75
confrontation with the energy frequency

1535.299 --> 1543.4189999999999
when it was really on to it and that was

1538.75 --> 1547.409
by the way pre pre damage situated pre

1543.419 --> 1550.74
[Â __Â ] up situation as it were and yeah

1547.409 --> 1554.0490000000002
the way because of how it played out

1550.74 --> 1556.659
there's kind of like I think I'm getting

1554.049 --> 1558.97
really psycho therapeutical maybe on

1556.659 --> 1563.0200000000002
myself I think there is like a distinct

1558.97 --> 1566.049
pattern that kind of has a

1563.02 --> 1572.1299999999999
post-traumatic cycle effect because of

1566.049 --> 1574.33
the the way things proceeded one another

1572.13 --> 1576.7
my peak energy

1574.33 --> 1578.4289999999999
I realized because of my ascension in

1576.7 --> 1581.74
that moment that I didn't fit in society

1578.429 --> 1585.5700000000002
then society from that perspective

1581.74 --> 1588.279
wasn't society it was secret society

1585.57 --> 1591.6589999999999
technically attacked me because of my

1588.279 --> 1595.71
peak energy that refused to attack and

1591.659 --> 1598.0
traumatized me with great horrors and

1595.71 --> 1599.8600000000001
because of that yeah and the fucked-up

1598.0 --> 1606.13
thing is in the game that happens too

1599.86 --> 1609.6689999999999
it's it's it's a synchronicity and that

1606.13 --> 1611.98
is scary to me in this case it is scary

1609.669 --> 1615.0700000000002
but because of this it is like I now

1611.98 --> 1617.169
have I've had and I'm dropping it

1615.07 --> 1620.649
because I'm confident enough that I can

1617.169 --> 1624.8200000000002
defend or die and then at least I will

1620.649 --> 1628.87
have tried to basically get peak energy

1624.82 --> 1631.96
back but because of the Association what

1628.87 --> 1636.52
happened I have like every time I grow

1631.96 --> 1638.44
more I have fear they'll come again if

1636.52 --> 1639.76
that even works that way I don't think

1638.44 --> 1641.68
it does because I'm

1639.76 --> 1643.75
in the same position I'm not in between

1641.68 --> 1648.04
group of people doing certain things

1643.75 --> 1653.02
following certain routes like I used to

1648.04 --> 1663.04
and the Jessie what guy was there it's

1653.02 --> 1665.02
part of it teaches heart lessons right

1663.04 --> 1667.84
eyes wide shut thank you for sharing

1665.02 --> 1672.1
this very personal right I have been

1667.84 --> 1675.04
bullied too but not there when my I've

1672.1 --> 1680.4699999999998
had severe bullying period but that was

1675.04 --> 1688.42
pretty much up until I was 10 like after

1680.47 --> 1690.3700000000001
that I maybe that is why the rage maybe

1688.42 --> 1694.2
that is where it was born from because I

1690.37 --> 1699.2199999999998
was like pretty freakin severely bullied

1694.2 --> 1702.07
like medieval-style where they would

1699.22 --> 1704.83
literally like outside the knowledge of

1702.07 --> 1709.4399999999998
teachers line up and just do [Â __Â ] to me

1704.83 --> 1712.78
I couldn't get past its [Â __Â ] up and

1709.44 --> 1715.42
maybe that is where the rage was born

1712.78 --> 1717.19
from originally because I was vulnerable

1715.42 --> 1720.8500000000001
didn't have a response and it's like my

1717.19 --> 1724.63
ego and the powerlessness just made

1720.85 --> 1727.03
itself bigger as a response and in a

1724.63 --> 1730.7800000000002
form of rage his vengeance or what I

1727.03 --> 1735.01
been through but then it kind of stopped

1730.78 --> 1738.04
I like got stronger after my preteens

1735.01 --> 1740.68
I got on sports since [Â __Â ] neither in

1738.04 --> 1743.26
Taekwondo horseback riding even before

1740.68 --> 1745.6000000000001
that but it was very serious with

1743.26 --> 1747.76
Taekwondo not that it was like oh I want

1745.6 --> 1751.6899999999998
to climb the ladder no I was literally

1747.76 --> 1755.17
that was my my my Zen training I learned

1751.69 --> 1756.88
balance that that's when I mastered

1755.17 --> 1760.1200000000001
balance I'm really good at it

1756.88 --> 1765.64
I'm not a tightrope guy I don't because

1760.12 --> 1767.4699999999998
I don't like it but in my in a station

1765.64 --> 1768.47
every way my balance is absolutely

1767.47 --> 1770.57
brilliant I

1768.47 --> 1772.73
and I've been training that [Â __Â ] forever

1770.57 --> 1775.52
forever that's why when I drop something

1772.73 --> 1777.38
or something falls over it I know things

1775.52 --> 1779.809
don't break because I always manage to

1777.38 --> 1783.89
catch it would be it with my hand or

1779.809 --> 1787.1299999999999
with my feet like I know forces I know

1783.89 --> 1789.919
impact it's like a computer level at

1787.13 --> 1792.679
that sometimes and that started like I

1789.919 --> 1794.39
discovered that potential in me through

1792.679 --> 1797.98
Taekwondo through what I could do with

1794.39 --> 1801.5300000000002
in with balancing compared to others

1797.98 --> 1805.07
right and yeah with that became like

1801.53 --> 1806.6
this a physical ability that also gave

1805.07 --> 1810.049
me more confidence and then people

1806.6 --> 1811.8799999999999
really didn't didn't bully me anymore

1810.049 --> 1813.47
last time I kind of sort of got Billy

1811.88 --> 1818.63
was a guy that's just dumb and

1813.47 --> 1820.809
headstrong and he basically cost me to

1818.63 --> 1824.8700000000001
burn myself when I was working and I

1820.809 --> 1828.6499999999999
basically went yeah temporary role

1824.87 --> 1831.4089999999999
berserk and used my early Taekwondo

1828.65 --> 1834.65
skills to just did him in his solar

1831.409 --> 1837.38
plexus and he just fell over how to

1834.65 --> 1841.64
breath and after that it's like nobody

1837.38 --> 1844.88
ever ever physically bullied me again no

1841.64 --> 1848.6200000000001
that's when they started to bully me

1844.88 --> 1848.6200000000001
psychologically after that point only

1854.68 --> 1863.3200000000002
like holding over my head like because

1857.62 --> 1865.6299999999999
people did see learn of me and like

1863.32 --> 1869.77
there were very envious people on those

1865.63 --> 1872.7700000000002
schools as well like there were really

1869.77 --> 1875.11
great people and there were really yeah

1872.77 --> 1877.06
disgusting people that would just look

1875.11 --> 1881.62
down on everybody that didn't have

1877.06 --> 1884.05
enough money or and now the general

1881.62 --> 1885.8799999999999
order the atmosphere after school was

1884.05 --> 1888.19
kept balanced like there were people

1885.88 --> 1890.95
there that made sure that there weren't

1888.19 --> 1893.44
any like really asymmetrical situations

1890.95 --> 1896.5900000000001
going on but there were still these

1893.44 --> 1902.92
people there and yeah just guy was one

1896.59 --> 1906.51
of them but yeah no more physical

1902.92 --> 1911.5
bullying after that pretty much ever

1906.51 --> 1914.32
because yeah you have physical adrenal

1911.5 --> 1917.71
response seems to be just naturally

1914.32 --> 1919.75
built in there my problem with it is

1917.71 --> 1928.5900000000001
that it probably be too strong in

1919.75 --> 1928.59
response right

1934.55 --> 1939.5
I thank you that flat fellow for the

1937.19 --> 1941.6000000000001
99-cent superjet the nation and good

1939.5 --> 1946.49
servant earlier for again another dollar

1941.6 --> 1949.6699999999998
uh anyway yeah I kind of like went on

1946.49 --> 1954.4
this dive and way back what yeah I'm

1949.67 --> 1954.4
kind of profiling my development here

1963.34 --> 1972.31
it's it's kind of weird I've actually

1965.56 --> 1977.01
considered like could I learn to

1972.31 --> 1979.54
actually become an effective beserker

1977.01 --> 1981.34
I'm not gonna do it through any freaking

1979.54 --> 1985.12
mushrooms thank you very much don't need

1981.34 --> 1986.6799999999998
that anymore because I think that is

1985.12 --> 1988.4699999999998
kind of how do you used to do but I

1986.68 --> 1992.5
guess there a way that I could

1988.47 --> 1994.66
potentially just yeah do actual I don't

1992.5 --> 1996.67
know straw man attacking with weapons

1994.66 --> 2003.89
and [Â __Â ] something like that

1996.67 --> 2003.89
to really see if the rage can like be

2005.06 --> 2014.79
effectively controlled because I never

2009.0 --> 2019.25
really tried it it's just I know every

2014.79 --> 2019.25
adrenal response adrenal reflexes so far

2025.84 --> 2033.34
yeah yeah martial arts Taekwondo for me

2029.92 --> 2035.89
it did a lot of good it's very important

2033.34 --> 2050.4
that I did that and in a way I do miss

2035.89 --> 2050.4
it a little it's just another time

2065.78 --> 2068.5
hmm

2071.84 --> 2079.56
yes as moretz that's that's great yeah I

2077.31 --> 2090.75
said tell myself the same thing but it's

2079.56 --> 2093.0299999999997
like I've I it's it seems more

2090.75 --> 2098.04
disruptive to me to try and contain it

2093.03 --> 2100.4
and not express it then to somehow find

2098.04 --> 2104.13
a non damaging way to express it like

2100.4 --> 2109.35
the strain of having that well up is

2104.13 --> 2111.9900000000002
extreme sometimes but on the other hand

2109.35 --> 2115.61
maybe it is because I have kind of let

2111.99 --> 2115.6099999999997
myself do that I don't know

2127.0 --> 2132.1
all right yes Desmond rats well yeah it

2129.85 --> 2133.8399999999997
is it is hard when you're passionate

2132.1 --> 2138.5499999999997
about something the problem with me is

2133.84 --> 2145.63
is that I'm passionate about a lot of

2138.55 --> 2150.4300000000003
things maybe everything and it's always

2145.63 --> 2155.35
like I have to try not to let it all in

2150.43 --> 2156.94
because I'm certain levels in certain

2155.35 --> 2159.22
moments because sometimes yes sometimes

2156.94 --> 2161.29
there is like almost like this barrier

2159.22 --> 2164.3199999999997
and it works yeah I can really dig and

2161.29 --> 2167.05
realize the energies and kind of keep it

2164.32 --> 2169.3300000000004
off up to a certain point and then I

2167.05 --> 2172.03
drop out when it becomes a little too

2169.33 --> 2174.25
strong for me to handle but other times

2172.03 --> 2178.75
like that defense is just not there and

2174.25 --> 2185.98
whatever I face it just gets in by

2178.75 --> 2190.93
accident maybe I should develop my

2185.98 --> 2194.02
instincts better to focus on yeah really

2190.93 --> 2204.6099999999997
trying to expect such things to come

2194.02 --> 2209.02
unexpectedly no iron Fe I didn't know

2204.61 --> 2211.11
huh some connection problems stream

2209.02 --> 2214.21
seems to be going fine here

2211.11 --> 2220.32
I'm watching myself on YouTube on

2214.21 --> 2220.32
silence and just no no lag or anything

2229.53 --> 2249.8700000000003
anyway of man she's talking 40 minutes

2234.54 --> 2253.5
about the [Â __Â ] yeah the Eddie Bravo

2249.87 --> 2255.99
situation with the Nate yeah basically

2253.5 --> 2260.55
shouting out Nathan isn't that like the

2255.99 --> 2268.25
second time he did that but yeah that's

2260.55 --> 2268.25
pretty interesting and yeah good on him

2269.06 --> 2278.46
but yeah to me you know that clique that

2273.72 --> 2281.43
group of people where Eddie Bravo

2278.46 --> 2284.78
typically hangs around like I I don't

2281.43 --> 2288.66
really know what to think of them in

2284.78 --> 2291.9300000000003
comparison to well the regular flat

2288.66 --> 2294.81
earth scene that I know that is a little

2291.93 --> 2298.5899999999997
bit then will loot more loose because

2294.81 --> 2301.95
yeah these people have they have

2298.59 --> 2306.1200000000003
contrary it's more more of a business

2301.95 --> 2308.1899999999996
they're involved into I think so it's

2306.12 --> 2312.69
just different and they have all these

2308.19 --> 2318.57
connections and I don't know I have

2312.69 --> 2321.35
trouble figuring it out yeah exactly

2318.57 --> 2324.92
status Moretz that's Eddie Bravo yeah

2321.35 --> 2324.92
some Joe Rogan

2325.69 --> 2334.03
and yeah maybe people remember like the

2330.94 --> 2339.91
the Joe Rogan with Eddie Bravo and Alex

2334.03 --> 2342.3
Jones I think that happened twice ha ok

2339.91 --> 2342.2999999999997
hojae

2342.57 --> 2347.59
they have big egos though

2345.28 --> 2352.1800000000003
well yeah you would have to have that

2347.59 --> 2356.7400000000002
and hey dude look at me I'm four pretty

2352.18 --> 2360.58
big ego I've literally been this sharing

2356.74 --> 2362.74
you details and even how where it's

2360.58 --> 2365.08
coming from so but that doesn't mean

2362.74 --> 2368.14
that I am now they're just gonna call me

2365.08 --> 2374.0499999999997
I look oh yeah yeah no that doesn't seem

2368.14 --> 2380.5299999999997
to be happening so if you know what I

2374.05 --> 2382.7400000000002
mean but yeah big ego is not really the

2380.53 --> 2382.7400000000002
problem

2391.39 --> 2401.3799999999997
you know I think that the ego is is very

2398.14 --> 2408.43
important to keep things running to keep

2401.38 --> 2411.2400000000002
it going and not to worry too much I'm

2408.43 --> 2415.2889999999998
kind of using my eager like that as well

2411.24 --> 2415.2889999999998
it sounds weird to say that

2427.22 --> 2433.3199999999997
all right anyway that happened again and

2430.16 --> 2439.62
yeah we'll see we'll see where it all

2433.32 --> 2442.38
goes oh man I kind of disconnected from

2439.62 --> 2444.15
my book writing project didn't I like I

2442.38 --> 2447.12
literally even have been forgetting

2444.15 --> 2449.88
about it it's still there though

2447.12 --> 2457.5299999999997
and of course like yeah the structure is

2449.88 --> 2468.1800000000003
also still there I she did meets

2457.53 --> 2470.4900000000002
catalyst right Hanako ella yeah because

2468.18 --> 2473.8199999999997
she you like David he brings Effie

2470.49 --> 2480.1499999999996
pretty good yeah yeah David wise right

2473.82 --> 2482.5800000000004
yeah he's awesome that a great honor to

2480.15 --> 2486.92
meet him very early on he was kind of

2482.58 --> 2491.88
like pushing me a little again yeah yeah

2486.92 --> 2500.07
do something I was like what me yeah you

2491.88 --> 2504.3900000000003
do something then others too but like I

2500.07 --> 2506.52
remember yeah yeah I I kind of offered

2504.39 --> 2508.65
myself very early on like ah I want to

2506.52 --> 2510.45
get involved I don't necessarily want to

2508.65 --> 2514.17
do a show but I'll help out and he kind

2510.45 --> 2516.0899999999997
of said okay do my comments of my

2514.17 --> 2518.16
youtube channel because he gets a lot of

2516.09 --> 2521.04
troll comments even back then and I did

2518.16 --> 2523.89
help help him out with that and it was

2521.04 --> 2526.35
it was interesting I did learn about

2523.89 --> 2527.8199999999997
like the trolls pretty early on because

2526.35 --> 2531.18
of that like how they work how to

2527.82 --> 2532.34
recognize it so that were even that was

2531.18 --> 2537.6299999999997
a good experience

2532.34 --> 2541.28
hey I Amanda you thank you for $2

2537.63 --> 2541.28
shapurji donation PayPal

2552.069 --> 2556.259
hmm thank you very much

2562.75 --> 2571.21
that's great thank you for all of you

2565.48 --> 2577.93
our support yesterday is well it's very

2571.21 --> 2581.88
helpful my worries are slowly slipping

2577.93 --> 2581.8799999999997
away like that thank you very much

2594.42 --> 2600.91
right was talking about David wise yeah

2597.46 --> 2606.2400000000002
dude I love freaking David wise but I

2600.91 --> 2608.5299999999997
think we have a personal issue and it's

2606.24 --> 2611.95
the weird thing is I think I even

2608.53 --> 2614.02
face-to-face had talks with him I don't

2611.95 --> 2615.5499999999997
really it was some time ago I've talked

2614.02 --> 2619.42
to a lot of freaking people I don't

2615.55 --> 2626.5600000000004
remember like maybe it was just through

2619.42 --> 2631.7400000000002
chat but yeah for some reason they've

2626.56 --> 2636.5499999999997
advised us always kind of stick to the

2631.74 --> 2640.24
the snowglobe model he's like a one

2636.55 --> 2647.23
model guy and he's always expanding on

2640.24 --> 2649.54
that and like I think I remember trying

2647.23 --> 2652.39
to explain to it I don't where was that

2649.54 --> 2657.25
that way it wasn't some show where was

2652.39 --> 2659.41
that it was in some group show with

2657.25 --> 2664.45
Patricia stairs I don't know it's a long

2659.41 --> 2667.66
time ago but I just remember that I

2664.45 --> 2669.6699999999996
really kind of tried to explain for

2667.66 --> 2674.6189999999997
example the holographic concept of the

2669.67 --> 2678.599
global of the heavens early on and that

2674.619 --> 2681.339
it didn't go into the distance over disk

2678.599 --> 2684.27
but that the globe is like a globe and

2681.339 --> 2688.24
it's just cut off point at the end aside

2684.27 --> 2690.64
and he never really responded well to

2688.24 --> 2691.839
that he's always just said now this is

2690.64 --> 2694.0299999999997
how I learned it

2691.839 --> 2699.46
it's a dome

2694.03 --> 2703.0
and they go around like that right now I

2699.46 --> 2705.52
don't know even into detail or how much

2703.0 --> 2709.2
he's even changed his personal views on

2705.52 --> 2714.07
that since then I don't see him like

2709.2 --> 2716.3799999999997
talking about his that I have well

2714.07 --> 2720.69
that's not sure he does talk about just

2716.38 --> 2720.69
I know he's just taking that route and

2721.98 --> 2727.09
yeah that seems to be like the only

2724.75 --> 2729.82
thing that seems yak is getting anyway

2727.09 --> 2733.27
because I every time I will always be

2729.82 --> 2737.32
like oh come on still don't get it like

2733.27 --> 2742.53
here's the issues like I could basically

2737.32 --> 2744.82
just go at him and just I don't want to

2742.53 --> 2747.27
create some kind of few dares that I

2744.82 --> 2750.7000000000003
could just disprove it like no no it's

2747.27 --> 2752.74
see there's no no object going distance

2750.7 --> 2758.89
and yeah that footage that footage is so

2752.74 --> 2763.8999999999996
in the Mirage in zone you know even in

2758.89 --> 2765.16
every system math system visual system

2763.9 --> 2766.4500000000003
it's like there's a difference between

2765.16 --> 2770.2599999999998
the Celestials

2766.45 --> 2771.8799999999997
and the terrestrials every time it works

2770.26 --> 2777.1600000000003
different it's not the same it's not

2771.88 --> 2780.36
objects it just isn't and I can really

2777.16 --> 2783.1299999999997
prove that and that would absolutely

2780.36 --> 2785.8
kind of get in the way of some of the

2783.13 --> 2788.17
his little things that he does and he

2785.8 --> 2790.69
does it eloquently and hey in a in a

2788.17 --> 2795.07
dichotomy system where you are

2790.69 --> 2797.7400000000002
considering the globe and the standard

2795.07 --> 2800.53
Flat Earth model as I just call it the

2797.74 --> 2807.33
disc then yeah it would get into the way

2800.53 --> 2807.3300000000004
of that and he wouldn't like it see

2812.32 --> 2817.48
and I think yeah I don't know if that's

2815.29 --> 2822.31
changed I don't really talk to him I

2817.48 --> 2828.42
would if he'd had the time very busy guy

2822.31 --> 2841.68
I think always was talk to little old me

2828.42 --> 2841.6800000000003
no apparent to us individually he did

2842.85 --> 2849.58
all right but but what does that mean is

2846.31 --> 2853.99
he stepping away from the conception

2849.58 --> 2856.45
that they are little lamps in the sky

2853.99 --> 2858.64
that are in physical literal positions

2856.45 --> 2867.49
over disk has he stepped away from that

2858.64 --> 2869.7999999999997
or is he because yeah the the technical

2867.49 --> 2872.02
consequences would be there like I'm

2869.8 --> 2875.4700000000003
just staring at that constant I don't

2872.02 --> 2878.2599999999998
know if he's even seeing that but yeah

2875.47 --> 2881.02
I've been basically laying out how that

2878.26 --> 2883.03
works here I'm flattered the early bird

2881.02 --> 2888.49
and the Flat Earth debates for years now

2883.03 --> 2891.1000000000004
and I see it I explain it I don't know

2888.49 --> 2894.4599999999996
how well that catches on to that do

2891.1 --> 2899.37
people have that oversight as well as I

2894.46 --> 2899.37
do it's all seeing around Sun right

2903.36 --> 2916.5
okay cool to me the Sun isn't like I

2913.65 --> 2919.92
don't even think that these lights are

2916.5 --> 2923.36
objects I think they're like

2919.92 --> 2928.32
manifestations or Holograms if you will

2923.36 --> 2930.59
that are a signature of that specific

2928.32 --> 2933.09
order of light that comes from that

2930.59 --> 2935.3700000000003
direction in relation to the position of

2933.09 --> 2937.44
the earth and it's like a holographic

2935.37 --> 2939.54
trademark at the epicenter of the

2937.44 --> 2943.05
direction of that specific light that is

2939.54 --> 2946.49
for the Sun for the moon with very weird

2943.05 --> 2950.04
with the moon because it's so big and

2946.49 --> 2953.16
not even that strong a light and even

2950.04 --> 2954.99
stars and planets so it's all just light

2953.16 --> 2957.1099999999997
manifests not even coming from something

2954.99 --> 2959.4599999999996
it's like a manifestation of life

2957.11 --> 2960.06
specific angular relation to that

2959.46 --> 2965.13
position

2960.06 --> 2967.89
and when you look straight at it you

2965.13 --> 2971.37
just see like a holographic signature at

2967.89 --> 2974.37
the edge of your vision you see the

2971.37 --> 2978.21
trademark of the correlating heavenly

2974.37 --> 2980.58
body as a holographic print at the edge

2978.21 --> 2987.2400000000002
of your vision and that includes the Sun

2980.58 --> 2992.36
and the moon so yeah that's currently

2987.24 --> 2992.3599999999997
how I understand it is probably like

2996.359 --> 3003.089
she's 19 all right Thunder Target so

2999.579 --> 3006.6890000000003
what's gonna happen if you just take one

3003.089 --> 3008.429
of those everybody say the Boone right

3006.689 --> 3010.199
and you just keep on going straight out

3008.429 --> 3015.779
you just have this camera on top of

3010.199 --> 3017.669
whatever probably have to be a rocket or

3015.779 --> 3019.799
something you just point it straight at

3017.669 --> 3022.679
the moon you keep on go and you keep on

3019.799 --> 3027.5389999999998
going is that moon gonna be increasing

3022.679 --> 3030.679
in angular size are you actually

3027.539 --> 3034.4390000000003
approaching and physical object that

3030.679 --> 3039.299
that is presumed to be the moon when

3034.439 --> 3042.9289999999996
that happens I've never seen that oh

3039.299 --> 3046.169
really so can you show me that show me

3042.929 --> 3051.63
some actual footage the approach of the

3046.169 --> 3055.589
moon from Earth go it is physical oh

3051.63 --> 3063.569
you're just gonna assert your your blank

3055.589 --> 3065.669
statement it is physical no proof or are

3063.569 --> 3067.859
we gonna reference the suppose that

3065.669 --> 3070.0789999999997
signal bounced nonsense now for which I

3067.859 --> 3073.109
still have not had any proof it's just

3070.079 --> 3075.15
stories and people pretending like

3073.109 --> 3081.869
they're enacting that process and

3075.15 --> 3084.539
they're not look for yourself

3081.869 --> 3086.789
well yeah looking well you can look at a

3084.539 --> 3090.4190000000003
hologram too you can look at your screen

3086.789 --> 3094.1690000000003
and think that a miniature our Wynn is

3090.419 --> 3096.779
sitting in a box behind the window in a

3094.169 --> 3098.069
moving jungle literally in front of you

3096.779 --> 3100.89
whether that's a phone or whatever

3098.069 --> 3104.119
you're looking at but no it's not it's

3100.89 --> 3107.1189999999997
not physically there it's a projection

3104.119 --> 3110.9990000000003
but your eyes will tell you it is

3107.119 --> 3113.1890000000003
physically there but your mind will then

3110.999 --> 3116.609
say wait yeah it isn't physically there

3113.189 --> 3119.489
but it is physically somewhere but you

3116.609 --> 3122.279
have no absolute proof of that but it

3119.489 --> 3124.349
seems logical all right it's not

3122.279 --> 3126.359
physically there so you can definitely

3124.349 --> 3126.779
look at things that are not literally as

3126.359 --> 3131.219
what you

3126.779 --> 3133.13
mine thinks it is bear right you have to

3131.219 --> 3137.039
actually collect some proof for that and

3133.13 --> 3138.4190000000003
yeah I've suggested many times why

3137.039 --> 3141.2690000000002
didn't you get some proof of that why

3138.419 --> 3143.249
don't you approach the moon and sing

3141.269 --> 3146.1589999999997
your shot from Earth just go and just

3143.249 --> 3149.819
see how the angular size of the moon

3146.159 --> 3151.619
increases as you approach right and you

3149.819 --> 3154.199
can oh we're getting so close you're

3151.619 --> 3155.969
you're probably gonna see now better how

3154.199 --> 3160.7690000000002
the craters are actually supposed to be

3155.969 --> 3162.779
creators and like all the moon shadows

3160.769 --> 3164.3689999999997
you know that you should see that

3162.779 --> 3167.489
definitely in approach still right

3164.369 --> 3168.989
because it is basically a reflection of

3167.489 --> 3171.119
the Sun right that we're seeing from

3168.989 --> 3173.909
Earth so yeah where's the moon shadows

3171.119 --> 3176.609
when there's a moon approach and all

3173.909 --> 3179.369
that like let's see that let's see it

3176.609 --> 3182.459
correlate with the moon phases on the

3179.369 --> 3186.299
earth and all that this that will be

3182.459 --> 3193.549
interesting NASA not need it just look

3186.299 --> 3198.049
for yourself is that funder foot

3193.549 --> 3198.049
something ridiculous

3207.46 --> 3214.329
yeah it's very confusing that there is

3210.16 --> 3216.67
an inherent hologram in the very design

3214.329 --> 3219.03
of the realm that you visually cannot

3216.67 --> 3221.829
escape from it's called the moon and

3219.03 --> 3226.8390000000004
yeah it'll drive people to become

3221.829 --> 3229.5
lunatics if they can't figure it out if

3226.839 --> 3232.869
they become obsessed over it

3229.5 --> 3239.079
because it is weird because yeah did the

3232.869 --> 3241.859
signature of the Moon apparition is just

3239.079 --> 3244.3590000000004
like really piling on top there the

3241.859 --> 3248.619
physicality assumption bias it does

3244.359 --> 3250.66
suggest heavily to the mind it makes the

3248.619 --> 3253.2400000000002
mind to reify it into physicality

3250.66 --> 3256.7799999999997
because it's just too mind-blowing to

3253.24 --> 3259.27
conceive that that might be the

3256.78 --> 3262.9300000000003
holographic blueprint of a light

3259.27 --> 3265.839
signature you're staring at I know it's

3262.93 --> 3268.66
too much for the mind to handle so

3265.839 --> 3273.5789999999997
people turn to lunacy it drives them

3268.66 --> 3275.95
crazy I can't handle it and then yeah

3273.579 --> 3278.5
the the heliocentric religion came along

3275.95 --> 3281.46
and gave that a very soothing easy

3278.5 --> 3285.28
solutions it's just no it's just a ball

3281.46 --> 3286.51
just just imagine frickin curvature and

3285.28 --> 3287.9500000000003
that you're spinning even though you

3286.51 --> 3292.48
don't feel anything and nothing

3287.95 --> 3296.2
displaces with Coriolis and just but at

3292.48 --> 3298.18
least you can rest your mind a little

3296.2 --> 3304.299
bit more about the moon that you're

3298.18 --> 3308.109
going to be seeing on nightly basis you

3304.299 --> 3311.46
know just it does come with the entire

3308.109 --> 3317.29
pile of other garbage that eventually

3311.46 --> 3320.23
rips you away from sensibility logos

3317.29 --> 3323.079
truth but yeah at least you don't have

3320.23 --> 3325.03
to worry about the moon so much you know

3323.079 --> 3328.1800000000003
that's what happened when heliocentrism

3325.03 --> 3331.21
arrived before that buffet and it's

3328.18 --> 3333.5789999999997
probably not even too long ago I really

3331.21 --> 3336.4
got in there before that yeah there were

3333.579 --> 3338.26
probably a lot of people getting very

3336.4 --> 3341.2200000000003
distressed when they saw the moon and

3338.26 --> 3347.2900000000004
and thought about what had boss

3341.22 --> 3351.5099999999998
yeah freak people out probably so and

3347.29 --> 3354.16
they if they would have really serious

3351.51 --> 3355.7200000000003
impulses you know that if they were

3354.16 --> 3358.18
crazy and talking about the moon

3355.72 --> 3360.64
regularly frustrated about not being

3358.18 --> 3363.64
able to figure out what it was then they

3360.64 --> 3371.92
would be deemed lunatics and that's

3363.64 --> 3374.74
historical can't get down no that's not

3371.92 --> 3376.9500000000003
true Thunderfoot even calling a

3374.74 --> 3380.95
Thunderfoot yeah it's not true I

3376.95 --> 3385.29
personally in a physical life experience

3380.95 --> 3387.6699999999996
seen a planet shine through the moon

3385.29 --> 3397.39
through the dark side of the Moon

3387.67 --> 3398.25
I think it was Venus was that should

3397.39 --> 3406.1099999999997
have been

3398.25 --> 3409.54
mm no 1998 must have been over 1999

3406.11 --> 3412.6600000000003
proof yeah I saw it I was there if you

3409.54 --> 3414.94
can actually probe my memory then you'll

3412.66 --> 3422.17
see that I actually did experience that

3414.94 --> 3425.76
I saw it and there was somebody else

3422.17 --> 3425.76
with me also seeing it

3431.32 --> 3435.34
and I have no proof yeah well I didn't

3433.39 --> 3438.0699999999997
even have a camera back then I died I

3435.34 --> 3439.9300000000003
was a heliocentrism I didn't know what

3438.07 --> 3442.51
the [Â __Â ] I was looking at I just didn't

3439.93 --> 3443.3799999999997
understand I was just like what this is

3442.51 --> 3450.3700000000003
impossible

3443.38 --> 3456.73
what is that yeah Hey and it's freakin

3450.37 --> 3459.27
23 years ago okay was concerned with

3456.73 --> 3459.27
other [Â __Â ]

3459.75 --> 3470.76
23 years 21 year a long time ago yeah

3472.74 --> 3479.83
yeah the camera oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

3475.45 --> 3482.89
yeah get out of here your your chat

3479.83 --> 3486.19
