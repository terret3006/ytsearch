as you can already tell it's hot out

99.439 --> 101.83999999999999
there

106.0 --> 112.079
it is very hot out there

109.36 --> 115.84
it's mostly clear sky but there are some

112.079 --> 115.83999999999999
trails being left behind

118.719 --> 125.28
can't exactly say it's covering the sky

122.32 --> 128.79999999999998
it's a really little

125.28 --> 131.28
fluffy micro clouds too and a bit of

128.8 --> 132.72
well a cloud bank but it's

131.28 --> 135.84
it's a thin one

132.72 --> 135.84
out there in the distance

135.92 --> 138.879
but not over there

139.04 --> 145.44
right but it's it's not very windy and

141.52 --> 145.44
it's it's really hot right now

149.12 --> 151.92000000000002
getting cooked

153.92 --> 157.16
oh yeah

161.2 --> 166.28
all right

163.28 --> 166.28
hmm

171.599 --> 177.959
it is thursday the 9th of september 2021

179.04 --> 184.76
started almost exactly on time for a

181.76 --> 184.76
change

188.0 --> 191.519
let's see what the temperature is

192.4 --> 198.59900000000002
yeah 25 degrees celsius i thought

195.04 --> 198.599
something like that

201.28 --> 203.599
all right

205.519 --> 210.08
yeah yesterday evening it peaked at like

207.599 --> 212.48
26 degrees

210.08 --> 213.36
but yeah there was much more wind

212.48 --> 215.84
so it

213.36 --> 218.08
was very bearable but i did like haul

215.84 --> 219.12
out

218.08 --> 221.59900000000002
uh

219.12 --> 224.4
three bowls of water for the birds out

221.599 --> 227.04
there because they just kept on coming

224.4 --> 228.159
it was nice because it's just this big

227.04 --> 230.72
flock of

228.159 --> 232.159
white doves there's like

230.72 --> 234.4
10

232.159 --> 237.12
of them

234.4 --> 240.31900000000002
and yeah i find them very beautiful to

237.12 --> 243.28
behold and they're like really cute

240.319 --> 247.76
sensitive little doves unlike like their

243.28 --> 247.76
regular gray pinions pigeons

247.84 --> 253.12
which are more like flying rats

251.28 --> 255.599
and they really love feeding off that

253.12 --> 257.44
water so as soon as they know there's

255.599 --> 259.519
it's it's what there's water there they

257.44 --> 261.68
just keep on coming back and coming back

259.519 --> 263.759
and coming back

261.68 --> 265.919
and i love to provide

263.759 --> 269.36
because it's just water

265.919 --> 271.59999999999997
okay it's filtered water

269.36 --> 274.8
it's a very little effort with a lot of

271.6 --> 274.8
payoff in my opinion

275.36 --> 278.639
hello mike

277.68 --> 280.08
zee

278.639 --> 282.08
dunich

280.08 --> 284.4
zidonich

282.08 --> 287.19899999999996
return to normal

284.4 --> 287.19899999999996
good to see you

290.8 --> 296.24
yeah still got nice weather here return

292.88 --> 298.56
to normal very much so

296.24 --> 300.8
although yeah during this first hour

298.56 --> 303.039
it's always kind of hot when it's like

300.8 --> 303.039
this

303.199 --> 308.0
and then after two

305.28 --> 310.15999999999997
the sun stops hitting the wall

308.0 --> 312.0
and then it becomes much more bearable

310.16 --> 313.759
and i become much more

312.0 --> 315.44
active

313.759 --> 319.039
because if i get overactive now i'll

315.44 --> 321.36
just start subtly getting a heat rash

319.039 --> 321.36
yeah

321.44 --> 326.56
that is not fair i'm sorry returns to

324.16 --> 326.56
normal

328.639 --> 331.52
hello cleary

332.16 --> 335.72
good to see you

338.96 --> 342.63899999999995
man

340.639 --> 346.479
yesterday was

342.639 --> 346.479
a lot of interesting streams

347.44 --> 352.12
i was very happy with my show yesterday

352.96 --> 357.19899999999996
except maybe for the part with ajm but i

355.36 --> 358.319
did i don't think i like punished him

357.199 --> 359.84000000000003
too hard but

358.319 --> 362.0
just

359.84 --> 362.96
i hope he's doing all right

362.0 --> 365.759
he did

362.96 --> 368.479
he did just walk away so that is

365.759 --> 368.47900000000004
admirable

371.6 --> 373.91900000000004
right

378.4 --> 383.75899999999996
right because remember

380.8 --> 387.44
why why it was it was because he thought

383.759 --> 389.199
that formula one race cars

387.44 --> 391.759
had

389.199 --> 392.56
vacuum drive engines

391.759 --> 394.72
that

392.56 --> 397.44
a lot of us suspect

394.72 --> 400.47900000000004
big jumbo jets have secretly and they

397.44 --> 403.199
consume us much less fuel and to be fair

400.479 --> 405.919
the idea is not really even that crazy

403.199 --> 407.039
it's just the way

405.919 --> 409.599
he just

407.039 --> 412.08
full-on assumed that it was real that

409.599 --> 415.039
was my problem with it and that he got

412.08 --> 416.8
very over enthusiastic about it it kind

415.039 --> 418.88
of in a bad way when i confronted him

416.8 --> 423.16
with it

418.88 --> 423.15999999999997
right you gotta test these things

423.36 --> 427.039
london weather is crap uh

425.52 --> 430.79999999999995
i'm sorry

427.039 --> 430.8
it is london though this is

434.84 --> 439.67999999999995
right so yeah the title today

440.479 --> 444.479
has a whole history as some of you might

442.8 --> 448.479
already know because i've been pretty

444.479 --> 448.479
much spamming it in chats

448.8 --> 453.36
it's a new game it's a rock paper

450.96 --> 456.039
scissor game

453.36 --> 460.0
and it describes a

456.039 --> 462.84
argumentation loop that we flat earthers

460.0 --> 465.68
are now confronted with every

462.84 --> 468.31899999999996
time ballers like to claim there's

465.68 --> 468.319
curvature

468.479 --> 471.919
and it's been yeah

470.0 --> 473.52
there were great streams yesterday jim

471.919 --> 476.4
bob went live

473.52 --> 479.68
that was awesome

476.4 --> 482.15999999999997
and also mitchell from australia

479.68 --> 484.8
that was awesome too

482.16 --> 486.47900000000004
and then later in the evening i watched

484.8 --> 489.759
part of brandon's

486.479 --> 493.039
that was also amusing

489.759 --> 495.28000000000003
didn't really chat too much

493.039 --> 495.28
uh

498.639 --> 504.40000000000003
right but yeah somewhere along the way

500.72 --> 504.40000000000003
i've i kind of figured it out

505.12 --> 507.84000000000003
right

509.039 --> 513.919
because this is like a thingy this is

511.199 --> 516.32
like a little puzzle

513.919 --> 518.4789999999999
and i wonder if you guys can

516.32 --> 521.839
tell i'd like to hear

518.479 --> 521.839
if you're up for it

522.8 --> 528.64
your insights as in how this is a

526.56 --> 532.16
a

528.64 --> 535.92
circle of arguments

532.16 --> 538.56
and how one negates the other

535.92 --> 540.4799999999999
every time

538.56 --> 543.5999999999999
although in the end the black swan is

540.48 --> 543.6
obviously going to remain

547.04 --> 551.5999999999999
anyway good to see you pj crew shank

551.92 --> 554.88
still at the missus

557.19 --> 561.519
[Music]

559.44 --> 564.48
all

561.519 --> 566.16
i right try not to forget to have some

564.48 --> 568.24
kind of fun right

566.16 --> 571.4399999999999
it's just like a ball and chain effect

568.24 --> 571.44
that's not really good

571.6 --> 575.6800000000001
all right if you gotta be with the wife

573.36 --> 577.6800000000001
then make sure it's gonna be a good time

575.68 --> 580.3199999999999
for her too

577.68 --> 580.3199999999999
but yeah

582.16 --> 588.1999999999999
you'll figure it out

583.68 --> 588.1999999999999
or you have already figured it out

594.72 --> 600.839
saw a video once it

596.48 --> 600.839
said alex was bill hicks

604.079 --> 608.64
yeah that that is that is a conspiracy

606.399 --> 610.56
theory all right

608.64 --> 613.12
and alex jones even talked about it

610.56 --> 613.1199999999999
himself

613.2 --> 617.76
he at one point he acted like he really

615.68 --> 619.5999999999999
was

617.76 --> 623.6
get bill hicks

619.6 --> 623.6
that was that was weird and funny

624.0 --> 629.04
but yeah i don't know i i don't think so

630.88 --> 636.16
but

633.279 --> 638.8
i can't exclude it from being possible

636.16 --> 638.8
completely

641.76 --> 645.959
all right see you later pj grushank

649.44 --> 652.8000000000001
videos can be convinced yes of course

651.36 --> 656.48
they can be

652.8 --> 657.92
especially if like if they

656.48 --> 659.839
have a

657.92 --> 661.68
well refined

659.839 --> 665.2
music track

661.68 --> 667.68
to support it because music

665.2 --> 669.2
makes things very convincing if it is

667.68 --> 671.8389999999999
played right

669.2 --> 674.8000000000001
the right song with the right suggestion

671.839 --> 677.44
right

674.8 --> 680.16
it's i find that if you just if you're

677.44 --> 683.7600000000001
just presented by pretty raw data maybe

680.16 --> 686.3199999999999
a couple of pictures but like no music

683.76 --> 687.68
things tend to be like less

686.32 --> 689.9200000000001
convincing

687.68 --> 691.4399999999999
but in a way that's good

689.92 --> 693.04
because then

691.44 --> 695.519
without music you don't have the

693.04 --> 697.92
tendency to jump to conclusions and hang

695.519 --> 700.32
on to those as easily

697.92 --> 703.04
because that in my experience is what

700.32 --> 705.279
music kind of tends to do

703.04 --> 705.279
right

707.36 --> 712.0
it's part of the reason why i've kind of

709.04 --> 714.24
avoided music in general like i got my

712.0 --> 715.519
intros on

714.24 --> 718.8
and that's it

715.519 --> 723.2
but i don't really play music

718.8 --> 723.1999999999999
because i find it to be a distraction

724.72 --> 728.639
but yeah if you want to conspiracy

727.04 --> 730.399
videos

728.639 --> 732.48
you want to make those

730.399 --> 734.399
you just of course you're going to use

732.48 --> 736.0790000000001
music right if you have time to edit

734.399 --> 738.24
then you might just as well edit in

736.079 --> 740.399
music and

738.24 --> 743.36
make it like a movie more compelling

740.399 --> 743.36
right more clicks

743.44 --> 745.839
but

746.639 --> 753.12
yeah people do tend to get lost a little

750.399 --> 753.12
because of that

754.32 --> 759.6
because eventually you start coming for

756.8 --> 761.5999999999999
the movie feel of it

759.6 --> 763.9200000000001
and not so much for the information the

761.6 --> 766.0
information is going to be the site it's

763.92 --> 768.24
going to be like the reason to go

766.0 --> 771.12
through it right if that becomes your

768.24 --> 773.04
motivation then you pay less attention

771.12 --> 776.9590000000001
you question less

773.04 --> 776.959
of the logic that is presented

777.36 --> 782.32
and that's a natural fact

779.36 --> 782.32
i think at least

783.68 --> 788.399
volume a bit low yeah sorry i can't help

786.16 --> 788.399
that

792.0 --> 795.519
i mean i could try to move the mic

793.76 --> 800.12
closer but i don't know if that's gonna

795.519 --> 800.12
help a lot i don't really think so

804.079 --> 807.04
oh moon shadow

807.68 --> 812.4799999999999
am i today i'm doing great

809.76 --> 815.8
but yeah i'm kind of cooking

812.48 --> 815.8000000000001
right now

831.36 --> 835.6
right man i've been watching some own

833.36 --> 838.0
benjamin this morning

835.6 --> 840.32
from his last upload

838.0 --> 842.8
it's just really good again sometimes he

840.32 --> 845.279
just like blows me away

842.8 --> 847.04
like sometimes oh benjamin just says

845.279 --> 849.519
things that are so

847.04 --> 851.68
fractally accurate and detailed and

849.519 --> 853.04
condensed that i just kind of feel

851.68 --> 854.16
ashamed

853.04 --> 857.48
this is

854.16 --> 857.48
like [ __ ]

859.76 --> 865.279
almost gives me sometimes it's personal

862.639 --> 866.8
but it's like a sensation like like wow

865.279 --> 868.32
i i

866.8 --> 870.959
if i just

868.32 --> 873.6800000000001
drop off the scene completely

870.959 --> 874.8
i don't think i'd even be missed

873.68 --> 876.959
because

874.8 --> 879.3599999999999
people like owen benjamin and others are

876.959 --> 881.8389999999999
like doing just fine with this whole

879.36 --> 886.0790000000001
project i'm trying to tackle

881.839 --> 888.32
of fractal thinking and esoterics

886.079 --> 888.3199999999999
so

889.279 --> 896.32
right it's always a bit of a challenge

893.279 --> 898.88
esoterically not saying whatever

896.32 --> 902.0790000000001
it's a bit of a challenge when a teacher

898.88 --> 903.4399999999999
feels their students have gotten better

902.079 --> 905.12
than them

903.44 --> 908.9590000000001
right because then you get like this

905.12 --> 912.32
weird ego sense of superfluousness

908.959 --> 914.88
and i'm not there yet i know i got more

912.32 --> 916.8000000000001
more gems to be revealed that i don't

914.88 --> 918.72
even consciously know about yet but i

916.8 --> 921.279
know they're coming because that's how

918.72 --> 922.88
it works it's how it has been working

921.279 --> 924.24
and it's not like the first time i had

922.88 --> 926.399
the feeling like

924.24 --> 928.399
wow these are these guys are so much

926.399 --> 929.44
better than me like i don't even need to

928.399 --> 931.839
be here

929.44 --> 934.8000000000001
well every time in reality that turns

931.839 --> 934.8000000000001
out to be wrong

935.279 --> 938.639
because it swings and if somebody hits a

937.519 --> 940.48
peak

938.639 --> 942.5600000000001
it's almost inevitable they are going to

940.48 --> 945.6800000000001
go through a slope and then they need

942.56 --> 947.3599999999999
another person to peek

945.68 --> 949.7589999999999
and then they might feel the same way

947.36 --> 952.0790000000001
about it

949.759 --> 952.0790000000001
right

952.24 --> 957.839
sensation which i often attribute to

955.199 --> 959.68
some form of jealousy

957.839 --> 961.44
i don't hold on to that

959.68 --> 963.8389999999999
don't let it make me bitter i don't let

961.44 --> 966.0
it make me alter my course and then

963.839 --> 967.6800000000001
everything is all right

966.0 --> 970.16
because it just goes away again and you

967.68 --> 972.4799999999999
just stop being distracted and continue

970.16 --> 976.24
on what you were doing

972.48 --> 976.24
the thing that was working out well

977.04 --> 979.36
right

981.279 --> 986.0
don't od on ob what

984.8 --> 989.0
what do you mean

986.0 --> 989.0
cleary

1003.759 --> 1008.72
wearing a damp shirt

1006.56 --> 1008.7199999999999
no

1009.839 --> 1013.519
now that wouldn't really work out too

1011.6 --> 1016.32
well

1013.519 --> 1019.04
i mean if it's really bad like if it

1016.32 --> 1020.1600000000001
would get like five degrees hotter god

1019.04 --> 1022.3199999999999
forbid

1020.16 --> 1025.199
september that would be crazy then i

1022.32 --> 1027.839
just get like a foot bath to cool me off

1025.199 --> 1027.8390000000002
that helps

1030.319 --> 1033.76
but i'm not gonna sit here with a wet

1032.0 --> 1035.439
shirt and like

1033.76 --> 1036.959
make my chair

1035.439 --> 1039.1200000000001
soak up

1036.959 --> 1041.28
the water and just

1039.12 --> 1041.28
no

1041.36 --> 1044.4799999999998
gravy overload

1050.559 --> 1054.8799999999999
rtn what is rtn

1057.039 --> 1062.559
hello applesmith

1059.6 --> 1065.8799999999999
what are my thoughts on the mud flood

1062.559 --> 1065.8799999999999
it's complicated

1067.039 --> 1071.28
i think it is being overblown but i

1069.6 --> 1072.6399999999999
think that the most important thing

1071.28 --> 1075.2
about

1072.64 --> 1078.0800000000002
the mud flood as

1075.2 --> 1080.48
as it is gone around the name of it the

1078.08 --> 1082.1599999999999
associations is that it does draw your

1080.48 --> 1083.1200000000001
attention in

1082.16 --> 1084.64
to

1083.12 --> 1087.9189999999999
reveal

1084.64 --> 1090.0
that the not too far past

1087.919 --> 1092.3200000000002
has been completely

1090.0 --> 1093.76
rearranged that the history is incorrect

1092.32 --> 1098.0
and that things

1093.76 --> 1100.4
have happened very differently from what

1098.0 --> 1103.039
how history

1100.4 --> 1104.64
says it did

1103.039 --> 1106.559
like the assumed stories about

1104.64 --> 1108.72
everything like that america was

1106.559 --> 1110.72
probably

1108.72 --> 1111.919
a really powerful

1110.72 --> 1114.559
nation

1111.919 --> 1117.6000000000001
with very wise people at some point an

1114.559 --> 1121.12
empire maybe even atlantis

1117.6 --> 1121.12
and that it fell and then

1121.44 --> 1127.44
europeans kind of

1124.4 --> 1129.3600000000001
colonized it again

1127.44 --> 1131.44
after it was no longer that powerful and

1129.36 --> 1133.76
there might have been like a sort of a

1131.44 --> 1135.3600000000001
flood event even like a separate flood

1133.76 --> 1137.28
event not even

1135.36 --> 1138.559
well you would be yeah you would call it

1137.28 --> 1140.799
the mud flood

1138.559 --> 1144.08
not the main flood that supposedly

1140.799 --> 1144.08
flooded the entire world

1144.799 --> 1148.6399999999999
right and that's what i think really the

1146.4 --> 1152.0
mud flood is all about right of course

1148.64 --> 1154.16
you have mud flood liquefication

1152.0 --> 1156.64
right then we're literally talking about

1154.16 --> 1159.039
what mud flood is how that can be caused

1156.64 --> 1159.039
all that

1159.44 --> 1163.3600000000001
but yeah some people like to think like

1161.28 --> 1165.2
oh everything was covered by mud the

1163.36 --> 1166.9599999999998
whole world's covered by mud and then

1165.2 --> 1169.28
i'd say no

1166.96 --> 1171.039
not really

1169.28 --> 1173.6
but there were a whole bunch of places

1171.039 --> 1173.6
that did

1174.96 --> 1178.96
and it was pretty much

1176.48 --> 1181.6
at the same time

1178.96 --> 1181.6000000000001
worldwide

1182.4 --> 1187.52
and it might have been this the thing

1184.08 --> 1187.52
that has basically made the

1187.919 --> 1193.8400000000001
the old world

1190.24 --> 1193.84
a lot of it collapse

1199.6 --> 1201.9189999999999
right

1205.28 --> 1209.76
so i hope that sort of answers your

1207.36 --> 1211.6
question

1209.76 --> 1213.6
if there was anything more specific

1211.6 --> 1217.6399999999999
you'd like to know about it you would

1213.6 --> 1217.6399999999999
have to inquire further

1222.32 --> 1230.1589999999999
here garnier bulgaria the roman ruins

1227.12 --> 1233.7199999999998
three meters of mud

1230.159 --> 1233.72
wow really

1237.6 --> 1239.84
huh

1242.0 --> 1247.039
well

1244.24 --> 1250.48
yeah what type of ruins are they and

1247.039 --> 1253.12
what what are the foundations they're on

1250.48 --> 1254.4
like i take it they're not on a mountain

1253.12 --> 1255.6
side

1254.4 --> 1256.88
right

1255.6 --> 1260.24
because

1256.88 --> 1263.6000000000001
lake of affection is not gonna make

1260.24 --> 1266.559
buildings sink into solid rock

1263.6 --> 1266.559
that doesn't happen

1266.64 --> 1270.96
but if it's not on solid rock but on

1269.36 --> 1271.9189999999999
dirt

1270.96 --> 1275.1200000000001
or

1271.919 --> 1278.3200000000002
well anything but pretty much solid rock

1275.12 --> 1281.6789999999999
yeah then liquefaction

1278.32 --> 1282.559
cymatic vibration might definitely make

1281.679 --> 1286.48
a

1282.559 --> 1288.559
big stone blocks sink into the

1286.48 --> 1290.88
into the sand

1288.559 --> 1294.28
or dirt or whatever it is except for

1290.88 --> 1294.2800000000002
solid rock

1309.28 --> 1313.84
right

1310.96 --> 1318.44
yeah apple smith dude the black sea man

1313.84 --> 1318.4399999999998
the black sea is freaking weird

1318.48 --> 1323.679
like the black sea is

1320.88 --> 1326.64
like one of the weirdest lakes in the

1323.679 --> 1331.48
world i think there's creatures in there

1326.64 --> 1331.48
that just like terrify you

1334.32 --> 1337.6
i mean

1335.28 --> 1340.72
it would not be

1337.6 --> 1342.9599999999998
strange to consider that like monsters

1340.72 --> 1345.039
coming out of the sea

1342.96 --> 1347.6000000000001
would have originally been based whether

1345.039 --> 1349.6
that really happened or not

1347.6 --> 1353.4399999999998
of just some of the creatures that can

1349.6 --> 1355.6
be fished up out of the black sea

1353.44 --> 1358.8400000000001
super freaky

1355.6 --> 1358.84
this is

1374.64 --> 1380.159
maybe top soil accumulation accumulation

1377.919 --> 1385.4
what

1380.159 --> 1385.4
a convention what does that mean

1390.559 --> 1394.559
all right

1392.159 --> 1397.1200000000001
seems like the

1394.559 --> 1399.2
clouds are moving over i actually

1397.12 --> 1402.76
welcome that

1399.2 --> 1402.76
at least for now

1427.12 --> 1431.12
dude

1428.159 --> 1433.0390000000002
but yeah look the mud flood

1431.12 --> 1435.36
what caused that

1433.039 --> 1436.96
if it is indeed liquefaction then i can

1435.36 --> 1440.1589999999999
only think of one thing that would have

1436.96 --> 1442.96
caused it and that is a giant

1440.159 --> 1442.96
sound event

1443.6 --> 1448.559
must have been pretty powerful whereas

1445.36 --> 1450.8799999999999
literally a certain sound

1448.559 --> 1452.08
very specific resonating type of sound

1450.88 --> 1454.7990000000002
is just

1452.08 --> 1456.72
massively loud and then would

1454.799 --> 1459.84
literally cause everything to very

1456.72 --> 1459.84
quickly liquefy

1460.48 --> 1466.4
to cause liquefaction

1462.64 --> 1466.4
it would have happened pretty quickly

1468.0 --> 1471.679
like suddenly you're just walking on the

1469.679 --> 1474.159
street everywhere and suddenly it's like

1471.679 --> 1477.6000000000001
ah buildings are just

1474.159 --> 1482.4
just sinking and you're like ah

1477.6 --> 1484.799
trying not to get swallowed by the road

1482.4 --> 1486.88
right and then suddenly it stops and you

1484.799 --> 1488.32
might be stuck with your foot somewhere

1486.88 --> 1490.48
or something

1488.32 --> 1492.0
like probably like that

1490.48 --> 1493.279
pretty freaky really when you think

1492.0 --> 1496.72
about it

1493.279 --> 1498.799
but then when i realized that

1496.72 --> 1499.84
then i remember a personal

1498.799 --> 1501.2
witness

1499.84 --> 1503.9189999999999
event

1501.2 --> 1507.44
from around 2012

1503.919 --> 1510.7990000000002
where we literally heard

1507.44 --> 1510.799
like giant horns

1511.84 --> 1513.6
like

1512.72 --> 1515.44
can't

1513.6 --> 1518.24
we couldn't even pinpoint like i was

1515.44 --> 1520.559
with my ex then and we

1518.24 --> 1522.32
it was like also going around like oh

1520.559 --> 1524.72
this is happening this is it people were

1522.32 --> 1526.8799999999999
like oh my god 2012 is the world going

1524.72 --> 1529.52
to end it's all going to go nuts

1526.88 --> 1531.8400000000001
but there were some really odd events

1529.52 --> 1534.08
like these horns

1531.84 --> 1535.52
almost like angel horns and i wonder

1534.08 --> 1537.6
like

1535.52 --> 1540.559
whenever that's coming from

1537.6 --> 1543.6789999999999
that might be the same root cause

1540.559 --> 1546.72
that sound effect however it is caused

1543.679 --> 1548.3200000000002
as what might have originally caused the

1546.72 --> 1551.76
the mud flood

1548.32 --> 1553.6
if that horn sound was like louder and

1551.76 --> 1555.76
at a

1553.6 --> 1559.6
very specific frequency that might have

1555.76 --> 1561.36
been able to cause the must flood

1559.6 --> 1563.84
and it's just really weird to realize

1561.36 --> 1566.1589999999999
that like yeah i did hear that

1563.84 --> 1568.1589999999999
i wasn't alone you would just hear horns

1566.159 --> 1571.8400000000001
what is that

1568.159 --> 1571.8400000000001
where is it coming from

1578.72 --> 1582.799
right we might not have seen the last

1580.799 --> 1585.279
mudflat

1582.799 --> 1586.48
right maybe it is gonna happen somewhere

1585.279 --> 1590.84
again

1586.48 --> 1590.84
within our lifetimes who knows

1599.679 --> 1602.679
anyway

1622.4 --> 1626.52
some feedback would be great

1628.4 --> 1632.799
better than a five minutes of silence in

1630.48 --> 1632.799
chat

1633.6 --> 1639.12
oh i didn't see that coming

1636.159 --> 1639.1200000000001
you know so little

1639.2 --> 1642.32
not necessarily

1646.159 --> 1652.3200000000002
i've figured out that if you're

1648.64 --> 1652.3200000000002
if you're not distracted

1652.48 --> 1657.6
if you're not distracted by things that

1654.72 --> 1659.919
are made to distract you away from truth

1657.6 --> 1664.0
that with just

1659.919 --> 1665.279
a fragments of knowledge and insight

1664.0 --> 1667.44
you can

1665.279 --> 1668.72
reconstruct things

1667.44 --> 1670.96
actual

1668.72 --> 1674.24
mechanical events and all that not to

1670.96 --> 1677.1200000000001
it's not too difficult to do that

1674.24 --> 1679.2
right it's the distractions though that

1677.12 --> 1682.7199999999998
pull you away

1679.2 --> 1685.44
from being able to quickly build

1682.72 --> 1687.6000000000001
reconstructed

1685.44 --> 1689.6000000000001
whatever you're thinking about like how

1687.6 --> 1692.24
does this happen

1689.6 --> 1695.26
like if i would have just been like oh

1692.24 --> 1697.039
like oh pyramids are satanic and

1695.26 --> 1698.72
[Music]

1697.039 --> 1701.44
yeah if i would have gone that like

1698.72 --> 1703.84
everything out that is

1701.44 --> 1705.8400000000001
like out of the ordinary satanic and

1703.84 --> 1707.12
it's all evil

1705.84 --> 1710.399
and like

1707.12 --> 1711.76
i would have never even come up with my

1710.399 --> 1713.9189999999999
idea

1711.76 --> 1714.96
of like the pyramids

1713.919 --> 1718.3200000000002
and how they might have been

1714.96 --> 1720.799
electrostatic generators to feed mana to

1718.32 --> 1722.399
giants that probably helped construct

1720.799 --> 1724.399
them

1722.399 --> 1728.0
right they would have just been like oh

1724.399 --> 1731.12
it's all evil it's all evil oh

1728.0 --> 1735.6
then yeah that would have distracted me

1731.12 --> 1738.6399999999999
from just putting those pieces together

1735.6 --> 1740.6399999999999
and then

1738.64 --> 1744.44
yeah considering that

1740.64 --> 1744.44
and putting it out there

1764.84 --> 1771.12
hmm yeah cleary i know

1768.559 --> 1773.9189999999999
yeah nathan is getting really good at

1771.12 --> 1776.7199999999998
like barbecuing ballers

1773.919 --> 1779.279
really good at it and yeah dude

1776.72 --> 1780.96
when the cook is good

1779.279 --> 1783.36
you get hungry

1780.96 --> 1786.72
so i know what you mean it's like oh we

1783.36 --> 1789.12
need another baller on the barbecue oh

1786.72 --> 1789.919
so good just the smell of

1789.12 --> 1792.9189999999999
them

1789.919 --> 1792.919
cooking

1807.2 --> 1813.679
bacon didn't last long unfortunately

1811.36 --> 1816.1589999999999
right well look part of that cooking

1813.679 --> 1818.3990000000001
process what we like so much

1816.159 --> 1820.7990000000002
when ballers get stuck and they're

1818.399 --> 1823.36
arguing and they start looping around

1820.799 --> 1825.9189999999999
well the title of today's show is just

1823.36 --> 1825.9189999999999
about that

1826.08 --> 1830.96
right this is about one of the cycles

1828.88 --> 1833.2
that ballers get stuck in when they try

1830.96 --> 1835.2
to argue curvature

1833.2 --> 1837.44
it's basically part of the

1835.2 --> 1839.52
one of the set games

1837.44 --> 1842.3200000000002
that nathan plays with him right the

1839.52 --> 1844.08
coriolis is one

1842.32 --> 1846.1589999999999
just a back and forth like a deviation

1844.08 --> 1848.799
no deviation but there's partial

1846.159 --> 1851.44
deviation no there's no deviation like

1848.799 --> 1853.44
it gets completely out of whack

1851.44 --> 1856.3200000000002
but with the curvature

1853.44 --> 1858.799
of earth based on the supposed horizon

1856.32 --> 1860.72
claim to be geometric

1858.799 --> 1863.2
that's a whole different game that's not

1860.72 --> 1864.48
just a back and forth well it is in a

1863.2 --> 1867.3600000000001
way but

1864.48 --> 1870.24
how the argument transpires is more

1867.36 --> 1873.36
cyclical as a little circle

1870.24 --> 1873.36
and the circle could be

1874.0 --> 1879.039
made into separate items and i did just

1876.399 --> 1882.399
that terrestrial refraction the radius

1879.039 --> 1882.399
value and the black swan

1884.64 --> 1888.88
and i kind of hope that you guys are

1886.64 --> 1890.88
going to look at that title and then see

1888.88 --> 1893.279
if you

1890.88 --> 1895.679
in a comment in chat

1893.279 --> 1898.64
could lay out how that works i've done

1895.679 --> 1901.44
that in chat like 10 times yesterday in

1898.64 --> 1901.44
different shows

1902.96 --> 1907.32
and i wonder if you could do it too

1907.919 --> 1911.8400000000001
if you could describe

1910.96 --> 1914.64
the

1911.84 --> 1914.6399999999999
the trinity

1915.12 --> 1921.0
the trinity of

1917.12 --> 1921.0
curvature argumentation

1925.2 --> 1932.279
nathan didn't win that argument

1929.279 --> 1932.279
uh

1934.96 --> 1937.6000000000001
okay

1944.88 --> 1950.0
so i'm gonna

1947.039 --> 1952.1589999999999
check out the chat and hope you guys try

1950.0 --> 1952.159
it

1959.45 --> 1964.799
[Music]

1960.88 --> 1968.159
no them versus them versus us no

1964.799 --> 1968.1589999999999
no he has done that

1969.279 --> 1974.48
that black swan phone is a really poor

1971.44 --> 1977.279
quality yeah it doesn't matter though

1974.48 --> 1979.1200000000001
because it's good enough quality and by

1977.279 --> 1982.08
the way it's not a photo it's a still

1979.12 --> 1982.9599999999998
shot from a live shot video

1982.08 --> 1985.519
yeah

1982.96 --> 1988.0
it's not as just a photo it's from a

1985.519 --> 1988.0
video

1989.76 --> 1996.1589999999999
it yeah it's of sufficient quality for

1992.559 --> 1997.519
you to make out that the horizon

1996.159 --> 2000.3990000000001
is not

1997.519 --> 2002.3990000000001
in the photo and still shot in the video

2000.399 --> 2004.799
where it's supposed to be according to

2002.399 --> 2006.4799999999998
spherical geometry

2004.799 --> 2008.399
so it doesn't really matter if it's poor

2006.48 --> 2009.519
quality doesn't matter if there's bendy

2008.399 --> 2012.7199999999998
cranes

2009.519 --> 2014.32
or anything like that has no relevance

2012.72 --> 2017.3600000000001
to the actual

2014.32 --> 2019.519
established argument of the black swan

2017.36 --> 2022.4799999999998
bad karma

2019.519 --> 2022.48
do you understand that

2030.24 --> 2036.64
so return to normal you want to try it

2032.64 --> 2036.64
jason brown you want to try it

2039.12 --> 2042.32
this is basically like a school

2041.2 --> 2044.0800000000002
assignment

2042.32 --> 2046.6399999999999
i don't do it often but i want to do it

2044.08 --> 2049.36
today i want to see you

2046.64 --> 2049.36
roll it out

2055.119 --> 2058.8
what is the circular

2057.679 --> 2061.839
what is

2058.8 --> 2061.8390000000004
one step to another

2062.079 --> 2066.7200000000003
argumentation

2064.879 --> 2069.1189999999997
what are the three steps and how do they

2066.72 --> 2071.2799999999997
work in relation to one another

2069.119 --> 2073.119
right terrestrial refraction radius

2071.28 --> 2075.599
value black swan

2073.119 --> 2077.679
this is basically a rock paper scissor

2075.599 --> 2079.76
mechanism i hope

2077.679 --> 2081.359
you feel that

2079.76 --> 2082.2400000000002
right

2081.359 --> 2085.2
now

2082.24 --> 2087.4399999999996
lay it out to me how it is a rock paper

2085.2 --> 2090.1589999999997
scissor mechanism and i will be very

2087.44 --> 2090.159
pleased with you

2092.32 --> 2096.0
what is terrestrial refraction

2094.399 --> 2098.16
measurement again no it isn't a

2096.0 --> 2101.04
measurement right

2098.16 --> 2103.92
it is a presupposition that light is

2101.04 --> 2104.96
bending around the sphere in order to

2103.92 --> 2108.88
present

2104.96 --> 2108.88
a non-geometric sighting

2109.52 --> 2113.92
that allows the baller to believe

2112.4 --> 2116.079
he's standing on the globe even though

2113.92 --> 2118.0
everything looks as if it was perfectly

2116.079 --> 2120.079
flat

2118.0 --> 2123.079
that's terrestrial refraction in the

2120.079 --> 2123.079
argument

2131.119 --> 2137.76
oh my god this guy is actually

2134.64 --> 2142.2799999999997
actually trying to break the the

2137.76 --> 2142.28
the curve trinity that's hilarious

2145.28 --> 2151.8390000000004
if you do not have to draw a line

2149.2 --> 2153.4399999999996
around the refracted curve

2151.839 --> 2155.7599999999998
to the horizon

2153.44 --> 2157.52
straight lines still exist despite

2155.76 --> 2159.92
refraction

2157.52 --> 2161.92
yeah but not to the horizon though which

2159.92 --> 2165.76
is what you need in order to establish

2161.92 --> 2168.88
the geometry them versus them versus us

2165.76 --> 2170.8
yeah i know straight lines ooh

2168.88 --> 2171.6800000000003
close proximity they're straight lines

2170.8 --> 2173.119
but

2171.68 --> 2176.24
you see

2173.119 --> 2178.88
the sphere earth that you believe it is

2176.24 --> 2180.56
is very big and so when you look at the

2178.88 --> 2182.0
horizon that's going to be pretty far

2180.56 --> 2184.32
away and if you then assume that

2182.0 --> 2185.599
terrestrial refraction exists you cannot

2184.32 --> 2187.839
avoid it

2185.599 --> 2190.48
and that means because you cannot avoid

2187.839 --> 2191.52
it you can never

2190.48 --> 2193.599
measure

2191.52 --> 2197.28
the geometry

2193.599 --> 2200.28
of earth in order to come to a radius

2197.28 --> 2200.28
value

2202.32 --> 2205.76
right

2203.92 --> 2208.0
do you see now

2205.76 --> 2212.0
that's step one that's terrestrial

2208.0 --> 2212.0
refraction to radius value all right

2212.079 --> 2216.0
well

2213.119 --> 2217.359
if you then abandon terrestrial

2216.0 --> 2219.119
refraction

2217.359 --> 2222.0
because you couldn't have established a

2219.119 --> 2224.32
radius value you need the horizon to be

2222.0 --> 2226.839
geometric and not terrestrially

2224.32 --> 2229.04
refracted in order to have a radius

2226.839 --> 2230.24
value well then

2229.04 --> 2232.32
guess what

2230.24 --> 2234.24
black swan oh so the horizon is

2232.32 --> 2236.1600000000003
geometric well guess what there's these

2234.24 --> 2239.4399999999996
sightings you see

2236.16 --> 2242.3999999999996
and in those sightings the geometry of

2239.44 --> 2245.599
sphere earth is defiled that's not

2242.4 --> 2247.359
possible in a geometric sphere

2245.599 --> 2249.599
black swan

2247.359 --> 2251.04
right and then the ballers forget

2249.599 --> 2252.7200000000003
everything and then they say oh

2251.04 --> 2254.24
terrestrial refraction it has to be

2252.72 --> 2256.3999999999996
terrestrially refracted because it has

2254.24 --> 2258.4799999999996
to be a ball right terrestrially

2256.4 --> 2260.7200000000003
terrestrial refraction

2258.48 --> 2263.599
negates the black swan argument well

2260.72 --> 2266.16
then you go oh really so

2263.599 --> 2268.4
if there is terrestrial refraction then

2266.16 --> 2269.52
how did you establish the radial value

2268.4 --> 2271.599
again

2269.52 --> 2272.72
if you can't draw straight lines to the

2271.599 --> 2274.32
horizon

2272.72 --> 2277.2
with sight then how did you establish

2274.32 --> 2280.2400000000002
the radius value see

2277.2 --> 2280.24
that's the cycle

2280.96 --> 2284.7200000000003
remember it

2282.56 --> 2286.16
play it out in your head as you read the

2284.72 --> 2288.24
title

2286.16 --> 2290.96
like see how they do

2288.24 --> 2293.359
connect how one would be used in

2290.96 --> 2297.96
response to the other and then how the

2293.359 --> 2297.96
next step immediately lockstep

2298.079 --> 2300.88
negates it

2305.28 --> 2312.2000000000003
hello james mason and hello by the way

2307.68 --> 2312.2
nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

2322.96 --> 2327.44
right so nathan yeah

2324.88 --> 2328.96
i have uncovered the mechanism of the

2327.44 --> 2331.52
curvature

2328.96 --> 2335.56
argumentation trinity

2331.52 --> 2335.56
it's the title of the show

2355.359 --> 2357.52
the

2360.32 --> 2367.92
you use the visible horizon as a point

2364.4 --> 2369.28
and use a straight line from you to the

2367.92 --> 2370.96
point

2369.28 --> 2375.28
would would this straight line be

2370.96 --> 2375.28
visible would it be based on your vision

2376.0 --> 2380.48
because i don't even understand how

2377.76 --> 2383.3590000000004
that's not supposed to be visible

2380.48 --> 2385.839
if you are going to base it on the site

2383.359 --> 2388.3199999999997
right which is your vision so if you're

2385.839 --> 2391.04
going to base anything on vision and

2388.32 --> 2392.88
yeah and the horizon is based on vision

2391.04 --> 2394.8
that's why there is a horizon because

2392.88 --> 2396.88
you're looking at things

2394.8 --> 2398.079
without vision there is no horizon it's

2396.88 --> 2400.1600000000003
a vision

2398.079 --> 2401.599
effect

2400.16 --> 2404.16
right so

2401.599 --> 2406.7200000000003
yeah you can imagine it's not visible

2404.16 --> 2409.52
but if you're basing it on site and the

2406.72 --> 2412.72
horizon it is visible because that's the

2409.52 --> 2412.72
medium it exists in

2414.72 --> 2420.0
yeah and yeah refraction might

2417.839 --> 2422.4
not affect

2420.0 --> 2424.88
things you imagine not to be visible but

2422.4 --> 2426.56
if it is taking place in a medium of

2424.88 --> 2429.359
sight

2426.56 --> 2431.92
everything according to the belief that

2429.359 --> 2436.4
there is terrestrial refraction would

2431.92 --> 2436.4
always be influencing sight

2437.44 --> 2441.52
at least a little

2439.2 --> 2443.2799999999997
further away from you than directly

2441.52 --> 2445.119
surrounding you

2443.28 --> 2447.2000000000003
and that would include the horizon which

2445.119 --> 2449.44
is always going to be far away

2447.2 --> 2453.0
and thus influenced by the assumed to be

2449.44 --> 2453.0
terrestrial refraction

2463.28 --> 2468.7200000000003
light deviation on a non-visible

2466.079 --> 2468.7200000000003
straight line

2471.2 --> 2475.2799999999997
yeah but this

2472.88 --> 2476.7200000000003
how did you establish that straight line

2475.28 --> 2479.52
though

2476.72 --> 2482.3999999999996
i mean you can imagine a spherical

2479.52 --> 2486.48
geometry then don't look at the world

2482.4 --> 2488.1600000000003
and then go measure to that math

2486.48 --> 2490.4
but that would have nothing to do with

2488.16 --> 2492.56
real world observation then right that's

2490.4 --> 2496.64
just your math it hasn't do hasn't

2492.56 --> 2496.64
anything to do with the physical reality

2497.359 --> 2501.359
so yeah keep imagining that you can make

2499.92 --> 2505.76
lines

2501.359 --> 2505.7599999999998
to visible things that you cannot see

2507.76 --> 2511.92
like you can't see the lines but it is

2509.839 --> 2514.64
to something that is visible well if

2511.92 --> 2516.8
you're doing anything in relation to

2514.64 --> 2519.359
something that is visible then yeah

2516.8 --> 2521.52
light and light bending

2519.359 --> 2522.88
whatever you assume to exist is going to

2521.52 --> 2524.8
be involved

2522.88 --> 2526.88
right

2524.8 --> 2528.96
so if you're going to measure anything

2526.88 --> 2531.04
in the real world

2528.96 --> 2532.56
and not just in a mathematical model

2531.04 --> 2533.44
that has nothing to do with the real

2532.56 --> 2535.7599999999998
world

2533.44 --> 2539.52
you're going to be subjected by light

2535.76 --> 2542.48
effects because it is the visible world

2539.52 --> 2544.079
you are trying to apply your math to

2542.48 --> 2545.76
you see

2544.079 --> 2547.92
you probably don't see

2545.76 --> 2551.119
probably just broke yourself your own

2547.92 --> 2553.44
mind apart so much to try and get away

2551.119 --> 2553.44
from

2553.92 --> 2558.319
from consequences of vision

2556.48 --> 2560.2400000000002
because of your terrestrial refraction

2558.319 --> 2562.4
claim that you just you don't you just

2560.24 --> 2564.4799999999996
want don't want it anymore you just want

2562.4 --> 2566.319
the straight lines back again in the

2564.48 --> 2568.88
visual world don't you

2566.319 --> 2570.72
you want it back

2568.88 --> 2572.96
well you can have that back you can't

2570.72 --> 2575.5989999999997
have your straight lines back but

2572.96 --> 2576.8
if you do then unfortunately the black

2575.599 --> 2579.28
swan

2576.8 --> 2582.079
argument negates

2579.28 --> 2585.2400000000002
any claim of spherical geometry of earth

2582.079 --> 2585.2400000000002
you see

2596.88 --> 2602.56
no straight lines unless you remove the

2599.04 --> 2602.56
fantasy of atmosphere

2604.319 --> 2607.52
well that's never going to happen is an

2605.92 --> 2610.48
oakley

2607.52 --> 2612.8
i mean where would all that gas go to

2610.48 --> 2615.44
it's contained within a limited volume

2612.8 --> 2616.6400000000003
container so it's not going to just

2615.44 --> 2619.599
go away

2616.64 --> 2621.2
in order to reveal

2619.599 --> 2622.7200000000003
the magical

2621.2 --> 2624.8799999999997
ball earth

2622.72 --> 2628.359
without a terrestrial refraction that's

2624.88 --> 2628.359
never going to happen

2634.16 --> 2640.48
apparent position of objects changes

2636.96 --> 2642.319
yeah that's correct 3e8

2640.48 --> 2645.76
the thing though is the apparent

2642.319 --> 2647.7599999999998
position of the horizon

2645.76 --> 2650.3190000000004
doesn't change

2647.76 --> 2652.7200000000003
according to condition it's only objects

2650.319 --> 2654.8
in relation to the horizon

2652.72 --> 2657.359
that change

2654.8 --> 2660.8390000000004
because of conditions you see

2657.359 --> 2665.24
the horizon cannot be refracted in

2660.839 --> 2665.24
relation to the horizon

2676.4 --> 2681.56
somebody seems to be very triggered in

2678.24 --> 2681.56
chat here

2690.319 --> 2693.319
what

2709.76 --> 2715.76
perfecting an imaginary line

2713.04 --> 2719.8
i know it's so funny right

2715.76 --> 2719.8
but the joke's on you

2720.24 --> 2725.68
terrestrial refraction is your anti-flat

2723.839 --> 2726.88
earth claim

2725.68 --> 2728.64
okay

2726.88 --> 2730.48
you're the one that's

2728.64 --> 2731.7599999999998
gonna have to deal with these problems

2730.48 --> 2734.16
if you wanna

2731.76 --> 2736.88
claim your ball belief is based on

2734.16 --> 2737.5989999999997
physical reality them versus them versus

2736.88 --> 2740.48
us

2737.599 --> 2744.04
so keep laughing

2740.48 --> 2744.04
you're the joke

2748.72 --> 2752.56
i'm making you think no not that much

2750.96 --> 2754.2400000000002
i've seen it all before i don't really

2752.56 --> 2756.64
have to think about what you're saying

2754.24 --> 2758.56
it's very familiar like a kumo virus

2756.64 --> 2761.1189999999997
does that all the time

2758.56 --> 2763.68
just starts laughing when he is being

2761.119 --> 2765.359
humiliated intellectually

2763.68 --> 2766.72
when he has nowhere else to go he's just

2765.359 --> 2769.359
like

2766.72 --> 2771.9199999999996
i'm going to ignore it all now and just

2769.359 --> 2774.56
emotionally claim victory

2771.92 --> 2776.4
forget about it and move on to make the

2774.56 --> 2777.68
same argument again

2776.4 --> 2780.319
that's what you're doing i don't have to

2777.68 --> 2782.72
think about that them versus them

2780.319 --> 2784.56
i just know it i know it because i

2782.72 --> 2786.64
recognize it because i've seen it before

2784.56 --> 2789.599
i don't really have to

2786.64 --> 2792.24
apply a lot of thinking

2789.599 --> 2794.319
right it's not that complicated

2792.24 --> 2798.56
your state of mind

2794.319 --> 2801.44
is not really complicated to analyze

2798.56 --> 2803.359
although it must be very confusing to

2801.44 --> 2804.7200000000003
somebody that is in that state of mind

2803.359 --> 2806.319
because when you're in that state of

2804.72 --> 2808.72
mind

2806.319 --> 2811.2799999999997
you are like that to

2808.72 --> 2813.52
subconsciously avoid

2811.28 --> 2815.8390000000004
certain pieces of information from

2813.52 --> 2817.28
sinking in

2815.839 --> 2819.2799999999997
that would

2817.28 --> 2820.6400000000003
hurt your belief that you're holding on

2819.28 --> 2824.5600000000004
to

2820.64 --> 2824.56
it's really not that complicated

2827.44 --> 2830.8
i don't

2828.839 --> 2832.64
understand well

2830.8 --> 2835.8390000000004
maybe you need to think about it a

2832.64 --> 2835.839
little more huh

2836.0 --> 2840.68
i don't i know what this is

2846.88 --> 2852.4
why does the horizon appear much closer

2849.76 --> 2855.44
in clear conditions well because your

2852.4 --> 2859.6800000000003
site limit can be altered right you can

2855.44 --> 2862.079
see only as far as the air does not

2859.68 --> 2865.2799999999997
blur things up for you right because the

2862.079 --> 2867.04
air does blur things up for you

2865.28 --> 2869.2000000000003
if there's very thick air with a lot of

2867.04 --> 2871.359
moist in it that's gonna cause your line

2869.2 --> 2873.839
of sight to be much closer

2871.359 --> 2876.5589999999997
and with that the apparent the apparent

2873.839 --> 2879.359
horizon site

2876.559 --> 2880.6400000000003
the thing is though that it only has to

2879.359 --> 2882.96
be

2880.64 --> 2884.96
too far once

2882.96 --> 2888.7200000000003
for the geometry

2884.96 --> 2891.839
of earth not to be spherical

2888.72 --> 2894.24
and that's the black swan argument

2891.839 --> 2896.319
and that's why terrestrial refraction

2894.24 --> 2898.319
was conjured to counter that specific

2896.319 --> 2900.24
geometric argument

2898.319 --> 2904.24
by claiming that things are not where

2900.24 --> 2906.0
they seem to be including the horizon

2904.24 --> 2908.64
that the horizon

2906.0 --> 2911.52
itself could displace because of a

2908.64 --> 2914.4
visual effect

2911.52 --> 2915.68
that would justify why the geometry of

2914.4 --> 2917.839
the site

2915.68 --> 2921.2
is not in the proper place according to

2917.839 --> 2921.2
spherical geometry right

2921.599 --> 2926.88
the horizon isn't in the right spot

2924.48 --> 2929.839
so yeah at some point yeah it might be

2926.88 --> 2932.8
apparently very close dude it might even

2929.839 --> 2937.119
be apparently too close right planet

2932.8 --> 2941.04
louisiana remember soundly's bridge

2937.119 --> 2942.8
planet louisiana like that that geometry

2941.04 --> 2945.52
if you assume the horizon there was a

2942.8 --> 2947.52
geometry was too close

2945.52 --> 2949.44
suddenly it's a very very small planet

2947.52 --> 2951.52
you think you're standing on how does

2949.44 --> 2952.88
that make sense

2951.52 --> 2955.88
right

2952.88 --> 2955.88
now

2956.16 --> 2960.96
it's just not

2958.319 --> 2964.079
geometric the horizon that you get to

2960.96 --> 2965.52
see is not a geometric horizon based on

2964.079 --> 2967.6800000000003
a spherical

2965.52 --> 2970.559
surface orientation

2967.68 --> 2972.64
that's not what it is

2970.559 --> 2975.28
i am a physics professor yeah

2972.64 --> 2977.2799999999997
effectively i am i know

2975.28 --> 2979.44
i'm a layman

2977.28 --> 2982.079
very dedicated

2979.44 --> 2985.44
i don't take no [ __ ]

2982.079 --> 2987.8390000000004
and i also have a layman's degree in

2985.44 --> 2989.2000000000003
psychological warfare right because

2987.839 --> 2990.88
that's what i'm going to be dealing with

2989.2 --> 2993.359
a lot people

2990.88 --> 2995.76
that are highly delusional religious

2993.359 --> 2999.2799999999997
fanatics that will lie

2995.76 --> 3001.599
to everybody and themselves to reinforce

2999.28 --> 3003.76
their beliefs

3001.599 --> 3006.7200000000003
right that's what a physics teacher a

3003.76 --> 3010.3190000000004
modern physics teacher has to deal with

3006.72 --> 3013.04
religious fanatics

3010.319 --> 3014.96
you're forced to deal with them

3013.04 --> 3018.319
so that's why i did that

3014.96 --> 3020.96
yeah a layman's degree that's right

3018.319 --> 3022.8
i don't need no stinking paper i got my

3020.96 --> 3026.48
skills

3022.8 --> 3029.2000000000003
to present for it

3026.48 --> 3031.92
and i don't need religious fanatical

3029.2 --> 3035.9199999999996
opponent opinions

3031.92 --> 3038.2400000000002
to reinforce that value that i know i

3035.92 --> 3038.2400000000002
have

3038.4 --> 3045.04
yeah i don't need your approval

3041.52 --> 3048.04
i don't need your peer review

3045.04 --> 3048.04
understand

3056.4 --> 3058.7200000000003
ah

3059.04 --> 3062.7599999999998
look at all these fans

3079.04 --> 3084.72
yeah dude

3082.16 --> 3087.7599999999998
citing yourself is great

3084.72 --> 3090.72
if you cite yourself that means

3087.76 --> 3092.8
you have a consistent memory of what you

3090.72 --> 3094.8799999999997
have said

3092.8 --> 3097.8390000000004
right

3094.88 --> 3097.839
and i know

3098.4 --> 3103.599
for a fact

3100.48 --> 3104.8
that you ballers and especially you flat

3103.599 --> 3107.599
earthers

3104.8 --> 3109.3590000000004
don't have that luxury so much

3107.599 --> 3112.0
so why you don't

3109.359 --> 3113.5989999999997
often cite yourself

3112.0 --> 3116.2
you know why that is

3113.599 --> 3118.8
because you constantly

3116.2 --> 3120.96
constantly get caught

3118.8 --> 3123.2000000000003
on video

3120.96 --> 3125.44
auditory everybody hears it everybody

3123.2 --> 3128.24
can replay you constantly get caught

3125.44 --> 3129.92
double speaking your own arguments

3128.24 --> 3133.04
constantly

3129.92 --> 3135.6800000000003
right so yeah then citing yourself is

3133.04 --> 3137.599
not that useful because you're just

3135.68 --> 3139.52
gonna point at oh look yeah i'm a double

3137.599 --> 3141.3590000000004
speaker i literally don't know what the

3139.52 --> 3143.2
[ __ ] i'm talking about at times because

3141.359 --> 3145.04
i literally contradict myself in the

3143.2 --> 3147.68
same sentence yeah if i do that

3145.04 --> 3148.96
constantly i wouldn't be citing myself

3147.68 --> 3150.96
either

3148.96 --> 3152.96
the thing is

3150.96 --> 3154.319
i don't do that

3152.96 --> 3155.52
i develop

3154.319 --> 3158.319
arguments

3155.52 --> 3161.359
i discover insights and then work with

3158.319 --> 3162.88
them and integrate them in the body of

3161.359 --> 3165.119
knowledge

3162.88 --> 3167.92
that we are gathering

3165.119 --> 3168.88
here over at flat earth

3167.92 --> 3171.359
and then

3168.88 --> 3173.76
it suddenly becomes a luxury to be able

3171.359 --> 3175.5989999999997
to cite yourself because yeah i said

3173.76 --> 3177.8390000000004
that i said that all that time ago i've

3175.599 --> 3180.8
learned so much since then

3177.839 --> 3183.119
but even then i got it right right or

3180.8 --> 3184.8
maybe i did get it wrong right i had a

3183.119 --> 3186.6400000000003
period where i went up against sleeping

3184.8 --> 3189.6800000000003
water and i thought that gravity was

3186.64 --> 3191.7599999999998
real it was just not

3189.68 --> 3193.68
you couldn't very manipulate it right i

3191.76 --> 3195.44
didn't understand that yet right so i

3193.68 --> 3198.0
haven't always been right

3195.44 --> 3200.48
but i can still cite that because i've

3198.0 --> 3202.559
went through that learning process and i

3200.48 --> 3205.04
came out victorious

3202.559 --> 3209.3590000000004
i recognized when i was wrong

3205.04 --> 3210.96
then i adapted then i corrected myself

3209.359 --> 3212.88
and then it's still

3210.96 --> 3214.48
something i can cite i can decide oh

3212.88 --> 3217.04
look yeah yeah some things are really

3214.48 --> 3219.359
difficult right to figure out

3217.04 --> 3221.68
this is what typically happens when you

3219.359 --> 3223.44
have trouble figuring it out and look i

3221.68 --> 3226.96
have myself

3223.44 --> 3229.119
on record as an example to give on how

3226.96 --> 3231.04
that process works

3229.119 --> 3234.079
isn't that just great

3231.04 --> 3236.079
i love citing myself

3234.079 --> 3238.8
because i'm a very good source for

3236.079 --> 3238.8
citation

3240.0 --> 3243.04
at least i think so

3245.04 --> 3248.48
right if people want to cite me that's

3247.599 --> 3249.52
fine

3248.48 --> 3251.599
do it

3249.52 --> 3255.04
if you dare

3251.599 --> 3255.04
if you can get a grip on it

3257.44 --> 3260.88
see

3258.319 --> 3263.599
so now you spent like four people in

3260.88 --> 3263.599
chat spent

3263.68 --> 3268.8799999999997
like at least three minutes to try to

3266.16 --> 3270.72
roll something out to shame me over oh

3268.88 --> 3273.44
layman's degree and oh i'm a psych

3270.72 --> 3275.9199999999996
myself but you see

3273.44 --> 3278.559
everything you roll out you think is an

3275.92 --> 3282.96
at home that could demoralize

3278.559 --> 3285.8390000000004
but in fact i'm very very good

3282.96 --> 3287.52
at taking that

3285.839 --> 3290.48
turning it around

3287.52 --> 3290.48
and then showing

3290.839 --> 3298.0789999999997
value right the value that you try to

3294.64 --> 3301.1189999999997
hide as you present it as an at home i

3298.079 --> 3305.119
turn it around and i show the actual

3301.119 --> 3307.119
value of what you think is junk

3305.119 --> 3308.96
yeah that's what i do

3307.119 --> 3313.2400000000002
very good at it now

3308.96 --> 3313.2400000000002
i've been training this for years

3321.76 --> 3325.48
yeah that's cute

3344.0 --> 3348.04
wow look at them squirting

3355.52 --> 3360.839
well them versus them versus us i think

3358.0 --> 3363.839
that you kind of

3360.839 --> 3365.92
blew your intellectual credit when you

3363.839 --> 3369.2799999999997
said that

3365.92 --> 3372.16
you can have a straight line

3369.28 --> 3374.559
despite terrestrial refraction bendings

3372.16 --> 3376.799
straight lines inside yet you can still

3374.559 --> 3379.0400000000004
do straight line geometry

3376.799 --> 3382.4
based on sight according to you which

3379.04 --> 3385.2
makes you just as delusional as a kumu

3382.4 --> 3387.44
virus was yesterday when he basically

3385.2 --> 3390.799
claimed the same

3387.44 --> 3393.04
it's a serious mental break point

3390.799 --> 3394.96
in plain sight

3393.04 --> 3396.64
because you think you can

3394.96 --> 3399.52
have

3396.64 --> 3402.0789999999997
you you think you can do geometry

3399.52 --> 3404.96
based on optics without the optics

3402.079 --> 3409.44
consequences you see

3404.96 --> 3411.839
that's delusional in plain sight

3409.44 --> 3414.319
anybody that has a lick a sense and a

3411.839 --> 3416.96
bit of talent

3414.319 --> 3419.44
can easily spot that

3416.96 --> 3420.48
if they still want to right because most

3419.44 --> 3423.119
people

3420.48 --> 3425.52
that do understand this [ __ ] they try to

3423.119 --> 3429.359
avoid you people

3425.52 --> 3433.839
at all costs because you're dirt

3429.359 --> 3436.5589999999997
you're literally stinky troll dirt

3433.839 --> 3439.119
and most people get very distracted and

3436.559 --> 3440.559
demoralized by your existence

3439.119 --> 3444.0
i however

3440.559 --> 3446.48
special armor developed for that

3444.0 --> 3447.44
right at that i am kind of a troll

3446.48 --> 3448.96
hunter

3447.44 --> 3451.119
i know what i'm doing here i got a lot

3448.96 --> 3452.319
of experience with this

3451.119 --> 3454.799
and

3452.319 --> 3454.799
already

3454.96 --> 3459.04
presided

3456.88 --> 3461.04
to the knowledge that

3459.04 --> 3462.24
i'm gonna have to deal with

3461.04 --> 3467.04
psycho

3462.24 --> 3470.4799999999996
freaks delusional idiots like yourselves

3467.04 --> 3474.2799999999997
probably for the rest of my life

3470.48 --> 3474.28
and i'm okay with that

3476.64 --> 3480.5589999999997
hmm

3478.0 --> 3480.559
what happened

3487.68 --> 3491.839
hmm

3489.839 --> 3493.359
you ban somebody but i don't see them in

3491.839 --> 3496.24
chat

3493.359 --> 3496.24
when did that happen

3500.88 --> 3503.839
what

3507.599 --> 3511.4
how does that work

3519.04 --> 3521.359
oh

3528.4 --> 3533.76
what happened there return to normal

3531.04 --> 3533.7599999999998
that's weird

3536.96 --> 3541.92
a real scientist well you know

3540.0 --> 3544.0
you're only a real scientist if you

3541.92 --> 3545.92
recognize the scientific method and if

3544.0 --> 3548.24
you recognize that if you don't use the

3545.92 --> 3550.16
scientific method correctly

3548.24 --> 3553.2
yet still claim science you are

3550.16 --> 3556.16
officially a pseudo-scientist

3553.2 --> 3559.839
pukinia shift

3556.16 --> 3559.839
perkins shift

3564.72 --> 3569.1189999999997
enjoy your echo chamber oh you mean that

3567.2 --> 3570.0
echo chamber in which

3569.119 --> 3573.2000000000003
four

3570.0 --> 3576.0
very enthusiastic anti-flat earthers are

3573.2 --> 3578.3999999999996
constantly trying to shame everyone and

3576.0 --> 3580.319
telling us we're stupid that's such an

3578.4 --> 3582.1600000000003
echo chamber man

3580.319 --> 3584.0
i mean that's what echo chambers are

3582.16 --> 3587.359
right

3584.0 --> 3590.559
that's what they are right places where

3587.359 --> 3592.72
people that hate you and try to shame

3590.559 --> 3594.2400000000002
you just get in

3592.72 --> 3596.319
and say

3594.24 --> 3598.72
whatever they can think of that's an

3596.319 --> 3600.96
echo chamber right

3598.72 --> 3602.799
it's not like they would typically get

3600.96 --> 3607.2
banned and nobody would ever catch on

3602.799 --> 3608.64
they ever existed in an echo chamber

3607.2 --> 3612.04
i don't think you know what an echo

3608.64 --> 3612.04
chamber is

3616.96 --> 3619.76
oh my god

3623.04 --> 3625.7599999999998
never ends

3625.92 --> 3630.2400000000002
people are

3627.359 --> 3631.7599999999998
intellectually doomed you really are

3630.24 --> 3634.24

single time doesn't matter how bad how

3653.839 --> 3659.44
personal it gets there is nothing you

3657.839 --> 3662.319
can say

3659.44 --> 3664.0
that's gonna make a dent or a scratch

3662.319 --> 3667.119
nothing

3664.0 --> 3668.72
you can look up

3667.119 --> 3671.52
anything you like

3668.72 --> 3675.359
spend thousands of hours of research and

3671.52 --> 3678.079
there is nothing you can say

3675.359 --> 3681.44
just make a scratch in what i do

3678.079 --> 3684.76
not a scratch i'm sorry

3681.44 --> 3686.96
but you can be of use to me for

3684.76 --> 3688.7990000000004
demonstrative purposes and

3686.96 --> 3691.68
psychoanalysis

3688.799 --> 3691.68
so don't leave

3691.92 --> 3696.76

3713.42 --> 3716.51
[Music]

3725.039 --> 3728.559
dude

3726.48 --> 3732.799
when's the last time i screamed at my

3728.559 --> 3732.799
camera that's a long time ago

3733.28 --> 3738.4
i mean i get a little animated here and

3734.96 --> 3741.64
there but i don't scream at my

3738.4 --> 3741.64
my mic

3742.72 --> 3746.5589999999997
it's ridiculous i think you're just

3744.64 --> 3748.8799999999997
squirting it i think you're just trying

3746.559 --> 3752.079
to reconstruct some pornographic version

3748.88 --> 3754.88
of me in your head and that's what you

3752.079 --> 3757.3590000000004
tried to project on me

3754.88 --> 3759.44
right i predicted that even i predicted

3757.359 --> 3761.5989999999997
everything about that people that can't

3759.44 --> 3764.319
handle what i do and how i do it they

3761.599 --> 3767.2000000000003
create this inside out world

3764.319 --> 3769.599
pantheon of figures i'm a part of that

3767.2 --> 3772.64
pantheon and that nathan is in there and

3769.599 --> 3774.0
a whole bunch of other people

3772.64 --> 3776.16
and you just

3774.0 --> 3778.799
create a mockery

3776.16 --> 3780.72
icon of us in your mind that has

3778.799 --> 3785.2
absolutely nothing to do with the real

3780.72 --> 3786.9599999999996
person no sensibility or likeness

3785.2 --> 3788.5589999999997
but that's what you have in your head

3786.96 --> 3790.4
and that's what you're going to reflect

3788.559 --> 3791.3590000000004
on everywhere

3790.4 --> 3793.28
right

3791.359 --> 3796.0789999999997
because you're stuck in your mind

3793.28 --> 3799.2000000000003
there's a nightmare in your head the

3796.079 --> 3800.7200000000003
nightmare is the inside out

3799.2 --> 3803.7599999999998
personification

3800.72 --> 3804.72
visually to your in your imagination

3803.76 --> 3806.559
of

3804.72 --> 3809.5989999999997
people

3806.559 --> 3812.6400000000003
that do and say things that you

3809.599 --> 3814.799
can't deal with that you can't handle

3812.64 --> 3818.0789999999997
but you don't feel you can step away you

3814.799 --> 3821.0389999999998
don't feel you can overcome it so you

3818.079 --> 3823.599
have to create an inside out icon of

3821.039 --> 3825.6800000000003
them in your imagination

3823.599 --> 3827.6800000000003
and then use that to

3825.68 --> 3829.7599999999998
project

3827.68 --> 3831.359
to just psychological attack like a

3829.76 --> 3835.039
demon does

3831.359 --> 3837.2799999999997
just lie slander

3835.039 --> 3840.0
bring down the level bring down the

3837.28 --> 3842.4
moral on every conceivable aspect

3840.0 --> 3844.559
because you're demonic you are currently

3842.4 --> 3847.28
demonically possessed

3844.559 --> 3847.28
you understand

3848.079 --> 3852.319
i can tell by the behavior by the

3850.559 --> 3855.44
mindset

3852.319 --> 3857.92
by the blank spots the white noise

3855.44 --> 3861.28
the non-response

3857.92 --> 3861.28
to things said and done

3861.44 --> 3864.079
i can tell

3864.72 --> 3868.72
i do this for a living pretty much now

3879.599 --> 3884.96
oh cps it's all still there in chat so

3883.359 --> 3887.2
it's all right there you can all scroll

3884.96 --> 3887.2
back

3890.559 --> 3894.3190000000004
no

3891.52 --> 3895.359
see it's projecting see now now this guy

3894.319 --> 3898.16
in chat

3895.359 --> 3899.5989999999997
now he's the one see it's so easy for

3898.16 --> 3900.319
them to just

3899.599 --> 3903.2000000000003
like

3900.319 --> 3906.88
yeah that makes perfect sense but

3903.2 --> 3910.24
i'll just make the target the obvious

3906.88 --> 3912.079
non-target so i don't have to deal

3910.24 --> 3916.0789999999997
internally with the spiritual

3912.079 --> 3919.119
consequences right i can just pretend

3916.079 --> 3920.559
very quickly it's about you

3919.119 --> 3922.7200000000003
not about me

3920.559 --> 3924.96
when it is about you

3922.72 --> 3924.9599999999996
huh

3926.88 --> 3930.799
you know what each category of people do

3929.52 --> 3932.48
that to

3930.799 --> 3935.119
they learn that and then they keep

3932.48 --> 3938.4
holding on to that for quite some time

3935.119 --> 3942.28
it's called six-year-olds

3938.4 --> 3942.28
they're very good at that

3958.4 --> 3963.599
no rodney blanket folding now the

3960.48 --> 3965.68
screaming is not going to stop but

3963.599 --> 3968.2400000000002
it's not gonna come from me it's inside

3965.68 --> 3971.68
your head that's where it's screaming

3968.24 --> 3974.16
right that's the memory you hold on to

3971.68 --> 3976.3999999999996
that one time that the few times when

3974.16 --> 3978.96
arwyn couldn't handle his feelings and

3976.4 --> 3979.92
then he expressed them frustration and

3978.96 --> 3984.0
you're like

3979.92 --> 3985.76
yes yes oh my god thank god irwin had a

3984.0 --> 3988.88
moment of weakness

3985.76 --> 3992.6400000000003
now try to hold on to that view

3988.88 --> 3995.039
arwen had a weakness moment oh

3992.64 --> 3998.0
if if i could just

3995.039 --> 4000.079
displace his current strength with

3998.0 --> 4002.559
just that one moment of weakness then

4000.079 --> 4002.559
maybe

4003.839 --> 4008.5589999999997
i can just magic him into that weakness

4006.72 --> 4009.9199999999996
moment

4008.559 --> 4013.039
it's magic

4009.92 --> 4014.16
yeah i know that's what you're doing

4013.039 --> 4017.28
i know

4014.16 --> 4017.2799999999997
it's really petty

4019.52 --> 4022.16
yeah

4020.559 --> 4024.6400000000003
but the thing is

4022.16 --> 4027.92
i got over that

4024.64 --> 4030.0
when that happened when i got really

4027.92 --> 4031.44
frustrated and like

4030.0 --> 4033.76
insidious

4031.44 --> 4035.28
on camera

4033.76 --> 4036.1600000000003
that was pain

4035.28 --> 4037.599
but i

4036.16 --> 4039.2
overcame

4037.599 --> 4042.319
the pain

4039.2 --> 4045.2
i confronted it i faced it i first

4042.319 --> 4047.0389999999998
revealed it to the world so i couldn't

4045.2 --> 4048.3999999999996
hide from it anymore

4047.039 --> 4050.1600000000003
i came out

4048.4 --> 4052.559
for my pain

4050.16 --> 4054.0
came out of the closet for my pain with

4052.559 --> 4055.6800000000003
the world

4054.0 --> 4058.64
with things in the world that have been

4055.68 --> 4060.96
burdening me very hard

4058.64 --> 4063.44
and yeah that's the revealing of a

4060.96 --> 4065.2
weakness but i didn't

4063.44 --> 4068.16
reveal it

4065.2 --> 4071.68
to parade my weakness around and then

4068.16 --> 4074.96
like oh give me something i'm a poor me

4071.68 --> 4077.5989999999997
poor frustrated irwin beggar please give

4074.96 --> 4080.16
me money because i am weak and i need

4077.599 --> 4082.2400000000002
help because i'm weak no no

4080.16 --> 4086.0789999999997
i presented it

4082.24 --> 4088.16
as a challenge to myself

4086.079 --> 4090.319
because i didn't want it anymore i was

4088.16 --> 4092.799
holding on to it but by putting it out

4090.319 --> 4095.2799999999997
in the open

4092.799 --> 4097.12
i confront myself and the world with

4095.28 --> 4098.400000000001
something that is there

4097.12 --> 4100.96
and then

4098.4 --> 4102.879999999999
it forces me to deal with it

4100.96 --> 4105.6
deal with it or break deal with it or

4102.88 --> 4108.2390000000005
break and i successfully dealt with it

4105.6 --> 4111.04
and that's why i no longer really have

4108.239 --> 4112.799
moments like that to that level anymore

4111.04 --> 4114.48
because i don't need to go there anymore

4112.799 --> 4117.44
i dealt

4114.48 --> 4119.12
with what was there inside of me

4117.44 --> 4122.0
i overcame

4119.12 --> 4125.04
right so that weakness that you think i

4122.0 --> 4128.08
have that you hold on to so desperately

4125.04 --> 4128.08
you try to magically

4128.4 --> 4133.92
project that onto me

4131.52 --> 4136.2390000000005
it's to no avail

4133.92 --> 4138.159
you see once you truly overcome an

4136.239 --> 4140.08
obstacle

4138.159 --> 4141.92
you can't go there anymore it's not like

4140.08 --> 4144.159
you don't want to you try to prevent you

4141.92 --> 4147.92
know you can't go there anymore because

4144.159 --> 4151.599999999999
you fixed it you changed you see

4147.92 --> 4153.4400000000005
that's what happens when you move on

4151.6 --> 4155.759
when you face something that you can't

4153.44 --> 4157.759
deal with that hurts you

4155.759 --> 4159.12
and then you actually tackle it and deal

4157.759 --> 4160.48
with it personally take the

4159.12 --> 4163.2789999999995
responsibility

4160.48 --> 4165.04
for you for your pain and frustrations

4163.279 --> 4167.4400000000005
and then deal with it

4165.04 --> 4170.96
and then hopefully fix it

4167.44 --> 4170.96
at least try to deal with it

4171.199 --> 4175.12
right that's what you're supposed to do

4173.44 --> 4177.3589999999995
that's how you move on that's how you

4175.12 --> 4179.3589999999995
grow that's how you build

4177.359 --> 4180.96
you have to face

4179.359 --> 4182.4800000000005
painful things

4180.96 --> 4184.4
inside

4182.48 --> 4185.3589999999995
and then deal with them because if you

4184.4 --> 4187.839
don't

4185.359 --> 4190.4800000000005
they're gonna lead their own life

4187.839 --> 4193.359
they're gonna turn you

4190.48 --> 4195.199
into what you

4193.359 --> 4196.0
three

4195.199 --> 4197.5199999999995
e

4196.0 --> 4200.88
eight

4197.52 --> 4202.96
and mr russian letters whatever that is

4200.88 --> 4205.28
and the other guy

4202.96 --> 4206.4800000000005
that's what's gonna happen

4205.28 --> 4208.639999999999
if you don't

4206.48 --> 4211.04
face it

4208.64 --> 4213.360000000001
it's gonna take you it's gonna cause

4211.04 --> 4215.28
white noise now you can never deal with

4213.36 --> 4217.199
that obstacle mentally again you can

4215.28 --> 4219.679
never face it again

4217.199 --> 4221.839999999999
but what you can do is make your mind

4219.679 --> 4224.08
twist itself inside out so you don't

4221.84 --> 4226.8
have to remember that you can never face

4224.08 --> 4228.96
it again and instead you'll just lie to

4226.8 --> 4231.04
yourself and to others and slander

4228.96 --> 4232.719
others demoralize others

4231.04 --> 4234.0
to avoid

4232.719 --> 4238.0
feeling

4234.0 --> 4239.92
that you avoided the confrontation

4238.0 --> 4241.12
and that the pain is still hiding inside

4239.92 --> 4243.28
of you

4241.12 --> 4246.0
but yeah because it is concealed inside

4243.28 --> 4248.239
of you you are gonna have a lot of pain

4246.0 --> 4249.76
oozing out and it

4248.239 --> 4253.919999999999
you're gonna need to get rid of that

4249.76 --> 4255.92
right so project it project it

4253.92 --> 4257.28
now it's our win according to you that

4255.92 --> 4259.84
has the pain

4257.28 --> 4261.04
i am the one that's not dealing with the

4259.84 --> 4263.52
obstacles

4261.04 --> 4264.64
it's not you it's not you hiding it from

4263.52 --> 4266.96
yourself

4264.64 --> 4269.52
and making yourself become a liar

4266.96 --> 4270.719
because of it to yourself and others no

4269.52 --> 4272.8
it's me

4270.719 --> 4274.32
it's the flat earther that's a liar

4272.8 --> 4275.84
we're the one that's can't face the

4274.32 --> 4278.0
facts because we don't believe in the

4275.84 --> 4280.56
body of science

4278.0 --> 4282.8
right and science is not a method not

4280.56 --> 4286.4800000000005
science doesn't prove anything blah blah

4282.8 --> 4291.4400000000005
blah blah complete nonsense

4286.48 --> 4291.44
right so delusion delusion

4291.6 --> 4298.56
a tapestry of delusion woven by the

4294.96 --> 4301.92
delusional to comfort themselves

4298.56 --> 4303.120000000001
when they get hints from the inside that

4301.92 --> 4304.08
they can't

4303.12 --> 4306.08
face

4304.08 --> 4309.76
their own obstacles

4306.08 --> 4312.719
then you have the tapestry of delusion

4309.76 --> 4314.64
to look over and be distracted by and

4312.719 --> 4317.199
find solace in

4314.64 --> 4318.719
right and even try to roll it up and try

4317.199 --> 4321.919999999999
to bang people over the head with it

4318.719 --> 4324.92
that don't know what it is

4321.92 --> 4324.92
yeah

4337.44 --> 4342.599999999999
i love doing what i do i really do

4349.04 --> 4357.239
science doesn't deal in proofs

4352.0 --> 4357.239
okay bobby stills okay

4358.0 --> 4361.159
all right

4377.36 --> 4380.36
huh

4386.48 --> 4388.799999999999
oh

4390.4 --> 4394.08
why mission russian letters why do you

4392.48 --> 4396.48
know how old i am

4394.08 --> 4397.6
are you considering asking me out on a

4396.48 --> 4401.32
date

4397.6 --> 4401.320000000001
did it give you a boner

4439.52 --> 4443.120000000001
okay

4441.12 --> 4444.48
well yeah that's

4443.12 --> 4447.12
i don't

4444.48 --> 4450.919999999999
that's not how i give out information

4447.12 --> 4450.92
that's not how it works

4471.52 --> 4476.719
ah george sanford that's what you get

4474.64 --> 4479.1990000000005
when you say things like oh

4476.719 --> 4482.2390000000005
this wouldn't be visible

4479.199 --> 4484.32
on the globe that yeah but what do you

4482.239 --> 4485.678999999999
think is gonna happen

4484.32 --> 4487.599999999999
seriously

4485.679 --> 4489.28
like you know what should be happening

4487.6 --> 4490.88
after you say that

4489.28 --> 4493.36
give them a foot in the door and then

4490.88 --> 4495.679
they're gonna say no of course it works

4493.36 --> 4498.0
out of course it works on the globe

4495.679 --> 4501.28
because we can see it

4498.0 --> 4501.28
what do you think what's going to happen

4503.76 --> 4508.56
right

4505.92 --> 4510.719
personally when it comes to like planets

4508.56 --> 4512.320000000001
i always like to think and remind

4510.719 --> 4514.56
everybody

4512.32 --> 4517.44
about how mercury

4514.56 --> 4519.679
within the solar system

4517.44 --> 4524.36
orbital mechanics

4519.679 --> 4524.36
is not calculated in

4525.04 --> 4532.08
right orbital mechanics still based on

4528.88 --> 4535.36
newtonian gravitation model

4532.08 --> 4537.36
well the funny i i just i love it i it's

4535.36 --> 4538.48
such a bizarre little

4537.36 --> 4540.239
factoid

4538.48 --> 4542.959999999999
that during the construction of the

4540.239 --> 4544.32
heliocentric model based on newtonian

4542.96 --> 4547.04
mechanics

4544.32 --> 4550.0
they had to leave mercury out

4547.04 --> 4552.64
because if they put it in there

4550.0 --> 4555.04
even like changing parameters and all

4552.64 --> 4557.280000000001
that the whole thing would constantly

4555.04 --> 4559.199
collapse they it would end up collapsing

4557.28 --> 4560.96
very quickly

4559.199 --> 4563.28
so what they did is they then just

4560.96 --> 4565.76
decide okay well screw it we're just not

4563.28 --> 4568.08
going to calculate mercury

4565.76 --> 4569.6
and then it works out perfectly then it

4568.08 --> 4572.48
balances then

4569.6 --> 4574.64
they can make it work lock step with all

4572.48 --> 4576.0
the gravitational forces calculations

4574.64 --> 4579.12
and all that right

4576.0 --> 4581.199
it's really really amazing to me

4579.12 --> 4583.92
it's like this aberration thing in the

4581.199 --> 4585.919999999999
process is that yeah it can be balanced

4583.92 --> 4587.1990000000005
out using newtonian mechanics in the

4585.92 --> 4589.6
modeling

4587.199 --> 4591.759999999999
but they have to leave mercury out or it

4589.6 --> 4593.4400000000005
collapses

4591.76 --> 4595.92
but still yeah

4593.44 --> 4598.48
when we look at the sky

4595.92 --> 4599.84
mercury is there

4598.48 --> 4603.12
so

4599.84 --> 4605.28
how does that work out for you

4603.12 --> 4609.599999999999
huh

4605.28 --> 4612.5599999999995
now i know that of course afterward

4609.6 --> 4615.6
they basically edit mercury and it's

4612.56 --> 4618.4800000000005
presumed orbit in it's just not viable

4615.6 --> 4620.56
by newtonian gravity and then they say

4618.48 --> 4622.639999999999
no no it's there

4620.56 --> 4626.2390000000005
in accordance to a

4622.64 --> 4626.2390000000005
einsteinian gravity model

4626.8 --> 4630.64
right

4627.679 --> 4634.32
they just calculate how mercury would

4630.64 --> 4636.719
orbit the sun because it's just one body

4634.32 --> 4640.08
and then it kind of works then they can

4636.719 --> 4641.84
get it a new numerical system for it in

4640.08 --> 4643.76
place

4641.84 --> 4646.4800000000005
but yeah they can never

4643.76 --> 4649.1990000000005
adapt mercury to the newtonian mechanics

4646.48 --> 4653.12
because then the whole thing collapses

4649.199 --> 4653.12
isn't that just fascinating

4654.56 --> 4660.320000000001
how do you explain that ballers

4657.679 --> 4663.84
what do you have to say for yourself

4660.32 --> 4666.08
i mean newtonian mechanics the modeling

4663.84 --> 4668.64
has been around for

4666.08 --> 4671.04
roughly 200 years

4668.64 --> 4673.1990000000005
why do they still

4671.04 --> 4675.44
use a solar system

4673.199 --> 4677.28
mechanical model based on newtonian

4675.44 --> 4679.759999999999
mechanics

4677.28 --> 4681.5199999999995
without mercury even though they still

4679.76 --> 4684.400000000001
just

4681.52 --> 4685.84
paint it over the model

4684.4 --> 4688.08
without any

4685.84 --> 4689.52
gravitational consequences

4688.08 --> 4691.76
they have to put it in there because we

4689.52 --> 4694.719
see mercury it's there right the visual

4691.76 --> 4697.1990000000005
is there it's part of the planetary

4694.719 --> 4697.199
cycles

4697.36 --> 4702.639999999999
but yeah in 200 years roughly

4700.48 --> 4705.36
they still have not been able to

4702.64 --> 4707.360000000001
complete the newtonian model for our

4705.36 --> 4711.759999999999
solar system right this is not even like

4707.36 --> 4714.0
well the galaxy's far away no no no our

4711.76 --> 4716.4800000000005
solar system right there right

4714.0 --> 4718.56
supposedly surrounding us

4716.48 --> 4721.04
they still can't get the newtonian model

4718.56 --> 4722.2390000000005
to work because mercury doesn't fit in

4721.04 --> 4725.28
there

4722.239 --> 4729.239
how do you explain that ballers

4725.28 --> 4729.239
why don't you address that

4735.679 --> 4740.88
it took

4737.28 --> 4743.44
einstein's special relativity

4740.88 --> 4745.679
yeah you mean no longer newtonian

4743.44 --> 4747.12
mechanics they had to get einstein in

4745.679 --> 4749.1990000000005
there i know that's what i just

4747.12 --> 4752.159
explained they couldn't use the

4749.199 --> 4754.639999999999
newtonian mechanics model

4752.159 --> 4757.839999999999
for the orbits in the solar system with

4754.64 --> 4760.8
mercury so it had to require einstein's

4757.84 --> 4763.92
little pseudo-ammonian wizardry

4760.8 --> 4766.0
to be able to find an excuse

4763.92 --> 4768.2390000000005
like oh no it's all works newtonian

4766.0 --> 4770.719
except for mercury

4768.239 --> 4772.879999999999
but einstein fixed it right he fixed it

4770.719 --> 4774.4
you just calculated in a completely

4772.88 --> 4776.88
different way

4774.4 --> 4779.759999999999
and then yeah it kind of works out but

4776.88 --> 4781.84
don't ask us about gravitational forces

4779.76 --> 4783.1990000000005
with mercury because then it all

4781.84 --> 4787.64
collapses

4783.199 --> 4787.639999999999
yeah we know we know

4791.44 --> 4795.839999999999
nobody disagrees that einstein corrects

4793.92 --> 4797.1990000000005
newton oh really

4795.84 --> 4800.4800000000005
well could you

4797.199 --> 4800.48
transform a uh

4800.8 --> 4806.639
a three-body planetary moon situation

4804.159 --> 4808.5599999999995
from newtonian mechanics to einstein

4806.639 --> 4810.159000000001
gravity mechanics please could could you

4808.56 --> 4812.080000000001
do that

4810.159 --> 4814.96
can you

4812.08 --> 4817.28
quickly transit newtonian mechanics into

4814.96 --> 4820.96
an einstein gravity mechanics piece

4817.28 --> 4820.96
could you please present how that works

4827.76 --> 4832.0
and that was a trick question because it

4829.6 --> 4834.400000000001
doesn't work because einstein in gravity

4832.0 --> 4835.92
can't calculate for more than one body

4834.4 --> 4840.638999999999
of attraction

4835.92 --> 4840.639
yeah i know this newtonian mechanics can

4840.719 --> 4847.36
right they're not compatible

4844.639 --> 4851.04
they're not compatible newtonian

4847.36 --> 4854.5599999999995
revitation and einsteinian gravitation

4851.04 --> 4856.88
are not compatible

4854.56 --> 4859.280000000001
they will never be compatible it's so

4856.88 --> 4861.1990000000005
incompatible it was even addressed in

4859.28 --> 4863.679
the movie interstellar and then

4861.199 --> 4866.0
suggested that this girl

4863.679 --> 4868.32
magical

4866.0 --> 4869.92
mathematics girl

4868.32 --> 4871.679
fixed

4869.92 --> 4873.4400000000005
the issue

4871.679 --> 4875.1990000000005
of newtonian mechanics not being

4873.44 --> 4877.5199999999995
compatible with einsteinian mechanics

4875.199 --> 4879.759999999999
which is ludicrous but hilarious though

4877.52 --> 4882.0
that they did that like that's funny to

4879.76 --> 4885.96
a mathematician that knows about that

4882.0 --> 4885.96
it's funny it's hilarious

4891.28 --> 4896.199
that's not a citation it's just an

4893.199 --> 4896.199
example

4904.639 --> 4908.08
yeah that's right return to normal yeah

4906.8 --> 4909.04
newton never

4908.08 --> 4911.12
or

4909.04 --> 4911.84
never does not like he never claimed now

4911.12 --> 4914.719
he

4911.84 --> 4916.639
specifically officially in a letter

4914.719 --> 4919.92
disclaimed

4916.639 --> 4922.639
scientific validity a hypothesis to

4919.92 --> 4924.88
gravitation he was appalled by that

4922.639 --> 4926.32
notion yeah

4924.88 --> 4928.84
appalled by it

4926.32 --> 4932.639
he didn't want that to be attributed to

4928.84 --> 4934.4800000000005
him it was just a mechanical game to him

4932.639 --> 4938.639
he would never

4934.48 --> 4943.879999999999
be caught claiming science over it

4938.639 --> 4943.88
yeah officially in a letter google it

4959.199 --> 4962.199
hmm

4972.32 --> 4975.759999999999
discovered a law

4974.56 --> 4977.52
no

4975.76 --> 4980.08
no that's not a natural law that's a

4977.52 --> 4983.040000000001
newtonian law that's a law

4980.08 --> 4985.04
within his model

4983.04 --> 4989.28
you don't seem to understand what you're

4985.04 --> 4989.28
talking about 3 e 8

4992.0 --> 4996.48
like the law of gravity little g and all

4995.6 --> 5000.56
that

4996.48 --> 5003.5199999999995
that's a law in his specific model it's

5000.56 --> 5006.400000000001
not natural law nobody actually claims

5003.52 --> 5008.639
that is natural if they do

5006.4 --> 5010.879999999999
then they probably have not graduated on

5008.639 --> 5014.2390000000005
the university of physics

5010.88 --> 5017.04
because they completely misunderstood

5014.239 --> 5018.799999999999
like you guys like you trolls you just

5017.04 --> 5021.36
don't get it you don't want to get it

5018.8 --> 5022.88
it's all too complicated because nothing

5021.36 --> 5025.44
works

5022.88 --> 5026.8
the more you learn the less you the more

5025.44 --> 5030.799999999999
you find out

5026.8 --> 5032.719
that your belief is a lie

5030.8 --> 5034.88
it's very frustrated

5032.719 --> 5034.88
i

5040.84 --> 5046.8
know yeah that's right newton's law of

5044.32 --> 5049.04
universal gravitation isn't a law that's

5046.8 --> 5049.04
right

5049.76 --> 5055.76
it's only a law within his model

5053.36 --> 5058.96
the model

5055.76 --> 5062.56
that excludes

5058.96 --> 5064.88
gas behavior right he got it wrong

5062.56 --> 5067.280000000001
he got it wrong

5064.88 --> 5069.6
gas does not go down go boom boom

5067.28 --> 5072.719
it spreads out in all directions to fill

5069.6 --> 5076.639
the available container and newton's

5072.719 --> 5079.36
physics model forces and all that didn't

5076.639 --> 5082.08
account for that it didn't deal with

5079.36 --> 5084.639
gases the only way gases were ever even

5082.08 --> 5086.08
involved in any sort of way

5084.639 --> 5088.719
is

5086.08 --> 5091.679
within calculations of trajectories

5088.719 --> 5093.6
mainly the friction of the gas an object

5091.679 --> 5096.0
would go through that's the only way

5093.6 --> 5099.120000000001
gases were effectively involved in any

5096.0 --> 5101.92
calculations within newton's model

5099.12 --> 5104.639
right he didn't account for the natural

5101.92 --> 5107.1990000000005
workings of gas he didn't apply relative

5104.639 --> 5107.1990000000005
density

5108.0 --> 5114.159
it's a faulty model it doesn't work it's

5111.84 --> 5117.28
incomplete

5114.159 --> 5120.719
right and within that incomplete model

5117.28 --> 5123.44
yeah newtonian's newtonian law

5120.719 --> 5128.159
is a law within the model it's a law but

5123.44 --> 5128.159
the model is incomplete it doesn't work

5130.239 --> 5135.159
because it excludes gas behavior

5148.159 --> 5154.36
it's only a flirt thing no it's

5150.159 --> 5154.36
scientifically proven fact

5155.04 --> 5160.239
you can do it yourself it's a very easy

5157.199 --> 5161.919999999999
to repeat experiment scientific

5160.239 --> 5166.08
experiment

5161.92 --> 5168.4800000000005
where you vary and manipulate

5166.08 --> 5170.5599999999995
the medium is the easiest way to do it

5168.48 --> 5173.04
the medium in order to cause a

5170.56 --> 5176.320000000001
disequilibrium

5173.04 --> 5179.6
between the density and the medium

5176.32 --> 5181.5199999999995
causing a disequilibrium force to

5179.6 --> 5183.92
displace it

5181.52 --> 5186.719
that's how you can scientifically prove

5183.92 --> 5189.12
relative density

5186.719 --> 5192.4800000000005
it's a scientific theory it's provable

5189.12 --> 5195.599999999999
and repeatable it's scientific fact

5192.48 --> 5199.28
it you cannot refute it it always works

5195.6 --> 5199.280000000001
it always works forever

5200.8 --> 5206.159000000001
you can do it very easy you don't even

5203.28 --> 5208.08
require a laboratory all you need is

5206.159 --> 5210.96
a container a bunch of liquids and an

5208.08 --> 5213.84
object that's it

5210.96 --> 5213.84
maybe some salt

5214.08 --> 5218.48
or just other liquids right it's right

5217.199 --> 5223.04
there

5218.48 --> 5225.599999999999
he's just buoyancy no no no buoyancy

5223.04 --> 5226.36
and gravity

5225.6 --> 5227.92
are

5226.36 --> 5230.719
derived

5227.92 --> 5232.56
from relative density

5230.719 --> 5234.719
yeah

5232.56 --> 5239.84
because there is no gravity there is no

5234.719 --> 5239.84
uniform force field pulling things

5242.88 --> 5247.679
yeah buoyancy

5244.56 --> 5250.2390000000005
is what happens when an object

5247.679 --> 5252.56
is less dense than its medium

5250.239 --> 5254.159
it goes upward

5252.56 --> 5257.04
because that's

5254.159 --> 5259.92
where the less dense material is that's

5257.04 --> 5261.76
where it can find equilibrium

5259.92 --> 5264.0
so while it is in equilibrium it's going

5261.76 --> 5266.320000000001
to go upward yeah you can call that

5264.0 --> 5269.44
buoyancy you can even calculate it with

5266.32 --> 5274.159
a g in there it's very cute

5269.44 --> 5275.919999999999
but yeah g excludes gas behavior

5274.159 --> 5277.44
that's the newtonian model it's

5275.92 --> 5279.92
incomplete

5277.44 --> 5282.0
relative density is not

5279.92 --> 5287.32
incomplete

5282.0 --> 5287.32
it does take into account gas behavior

5294.0 --> 5300.89
man i got the trolls squirting in today

5297.78 --> 5300.889999999999
[Music]

5304.639 --> 5309.84
ah

5305.76 --> 5309.84
sound was gone there for a second

5312.8 --> 5317.4400000000005
okay i'm gonna kick some of this out

5314.48 --> 5319.678999999999
this is getting really annoying

5317.44 --> 5324.32
right yeah if you have a persistent

5319.679 --> 5325.12
account and you wish to go up against me

5324.32 --> 5326.799999999999
like

5325.12 --> 5328.5599999999995
three e8

5326.8 --> 5330.639
and them versus them versus us that's

5328.56 --> 5333.120000000001
fine if you're just gonna make stupid

5330.639 --> 5337.2390000000005
sock accounts just to say some stupid at

5333.12 --> 5337.239
home i'm just gonna kick you

5338.719 --> 5342.96
or if you

5340.159 --> 5344.96
immediately continue on with only at

5342.96 --> 5347.04
home in response to anything that i do

5344.96 --> 5349.04
then i'm also going to kick you

5347.04 --> 5351.84
because

5349.04 --> 5355.04
i already utilized you

5351.84 --> 5356.08
i've already used you up

5355.04 --> 5359.28
yeah

5356.08 --> 5361.44
like a slave [ __ ] i've already used you

5359.28 --> 5364.639
up you understand

5361.44 --> 5367.36
and i can cast you aside in a ditch

5364.639 --> 5369.36
ban you whenever i like whenever i

5367.36 --> 5372.36
please

5369.36 --> 5372.36
alright

5383.92 --> 5387.36
but they don't really feel the need to

5385.679 --> 5388.4
anyway i'm just gonna let you squirt in

5387.36 --> 5389.679
chat

5388.4 --> 5391.36
for a bit

5389.679 --> 5393.04
and see what happens if it's not going

5391.36 --> 5395.199
to die down then i will kick you out

5393.04 --> 5396.719
because i want the last 50 minutes of my

5395.199 --> 5399.04
show to be

5396.719 --> 5401.84
kind of peaceful at least and it doesn't

5399.04 --> 5404.48
seem like you trolls are gonna get

5401.84 --> 5407.84
gonna find any peace anytime soon if you

5404.48 --> 5407.839999999999
know what i mean

5429.04 --> 5435.12
okay why does dry ice when it sublimates

5432.0 --> 5438.0
to gas stay down by the ground well if

5435.12 --> 5439.04
you can still see it it's not entirely

5438.0 --> 5440.48
gas

5439.04 --> 5443.5199999999995
right

5440.48 --> 5446.08
so it might turn into gas but then kind

5443.52 --> 5449.280000000001
of appear like it's clouds right i know

5446.08 --> 5450.8
how that works

5449.28 --> 5453.36
if you can

5450.8 --> 5456.08
see it

5453.36 --> 5458.48
it's not fully gas

5456.08 --> 5461.76
it's probably in an in-between state and

5458.48 --> 5463.759999999999
as long as it's not fully gas it's like

5461.76 --> 5465.84
partial droplets

5463.76 --> 5468.400000000001
as a mist

5465.84 --> 5469.360000000001
liquids

5468.4 --> 5472.719
do

5469.36 --> 5472.719
have inertia

5472.96 --> 5479.44
right they will sink to the ground but

5476.32 --> 5482.48
then as soon as the cloudiness of it the

5479.44 --> 5486.159
visibility as it dissipates

5482.48 --> 5488.5599999999995
and it truly fully transits into a full

5486.159 --> 5491.12
gaseous form

5488.56 --> 5493.360000000001
it's gonna spread in all directions you

5491.12 --> 5493.36
see

5494.239 --> 5499.5199999999995
i know you like to overlooked it i know

5495.92 --> 5501.6
you like to think that you can see gas

5499.52 --> 5505.040000000001
yeah

5501.6 --> 5507.92
that's extremely rare

5505.04 --> 5510.639
there's only a few materials which

5507.92 --> 5512.56
actually are visible in a pure gaseous

5510.639 --> 5513.52
state

5512.56 --> 5516.8
is it

5513.52 --> 5518.88
iodine i think and argon maybe or what

5516.8 --> 5520.4800000000005
is it

5518.88 --> 5522.8
was it bromine

5520.48 --> 5525.04
certain types of material that

5522.8 --> 5527.84
in gaseous form are still visible but

5525.04 --> 5530.96
that's extremely rare

5527.84 --> 5533.92
those are rare bromine right right those

5530.96 --> 5536.56
are rare things

5533.92 --> 5539.12
vast vast majority of

5536.56 --> 5543.679
materials in their gaseous state are

5539.12 --> 5544.96
completely transparent you don't see it

5543.679 --> 5548.08
you see

5544.96 --> 5549.84
so if you have some gas

5548.08 --> 5550.96
like co2

5549.84 --> 5553.52
whatever

5550.96 --> 5555.6
dry ice and you pour it

5553.52 --> 5557.92
and then it's like oh look at the mist

5555.6 --> 5560.08
oh if it's mist

5557.92 --> 5562.8
it's not gas

5560.08 --> 5564.08
because you can't see the gas

5562.8 --> 5567.4400000000005
you can see

5564.08 --> 5568.8
mist that means it has to be droplets

5567.44 --> 5571.44
because otherwise you wouldn't be able

5568.8 --> 5571.4400000000005
to see it

5572.239 --> 5575.839999999999
people don't seem to get this they think

5574.639 --> 5577.36
that

5575.84 --> 5579.84
clouds are

5577.36 --> 5581.599999999999
gas or something you should know better

5579.84 --> 5583.28
than that

5581.6 --> 5586.159000000001
mist clouds

5583.28 --> 5586.159
that's not gas

5586.719 --> 5591.679
it's droplets

5588.56 --> 5591.679
otherwise you couldn't see it

5597.92 --> 5602.84
ah anyway i'll be back in two minutes

5650.08 --> 5653.08
so

5669.04 --> 5672.04
ah

5672.32 --> 5677.759999999999
damn it

5674.8 --> 5680.2390000000005
somebody's on the toilet

5677.76 --> 5683.4800000000005
it's a try again

5680.239 --> 5683.48
and a few

5694.88 --> 5698.6
used to math

5716.08 --> 5719.76
yeah good point return to normal

5724.159 --> 5729.28
now but the demon

5726.159 --> 5730.96
the demon troll part is really there to

5729.28 --> 5732.639
help

5730.96 --> 5734.56
soothe him

5732.639 --> 5737.04
back from being restless because of the

5734.56 --> 5740.080000000001
confrontation right

5737.04 --> 5742.08
it's all just chanting

5740.08 --> 5744.48
chanting themselves back to sleep

5742.08 --> 5746.4
basically

5744.48 --> 5747.678999999999
and it is demonic because

5746.4 --> 5750.08
no any

5747.679 --> 5751.76
measure of lies or peer pressure

5750.08 --> 5755.28
intimidation

5751.76 --> 5757.6
shaming will be applied no hold bars

5755.28 --> 5759.119
like they give it air everything

5757.6 --> 5761.84
because all they want is just to go back

5759.119 --> 5761.839999999999
to sleep right

5762.32 --> 5768.04
so yeah that's pretty much why why they

5764.8 --> 5768.04
do it

5777.92 --> 5783.36
no cps it's not the disagreement with

5780.96 --> 5785.92
him that makes people demon trolls it's

5783.36 --> 5788.5599999999995
the actual being demon trolls in their

5785.92 --> 5791.92
behavior having been extensively

5788.56 --> 5793.679
analyzed and described to detail

5791.92 --> 5797.4400000000005
that makes them a demon troll not the

5793.679 --> 5801.119
disagreement right because cps

5797.44 --> 5803.44
and then first them for us and

5801.119 --> 5806.96
three e8

5803.44 --> 5810.239
we don't give a flying [ __ ] if you

5806.96 --> 5812.0
disagree with us you don't care you

5810.239 --> 5814.08
disagree with us we'll make an argument

5812.0 --> 5817.84
then oh the argument makes no sense and

5814.08 --> 5819.679
is easily refuted and you ignore that

5817.84 --> 5823.92
well we don't care either it's a

5819.679 --> 5825.76
nuisance it's annoying to deal with that

5823.92 --> 5828.2390000000005
we don't care if you disagree because

5825.76 --> 5831.280000000001
you don't have a case you don't have an

5828.239 --> 5833.759999999999
argument you don't make any arguments

5831.28 --> 5836.8
that cannot be quickly and easily

5833.76 --> 5839.280000000001
refuted based on sound logic

5836.8 --> 5841.84
right that thing you abandoned for your

5839.28 --> 5841.84
belief

5859.92 --> 5862.92
so

5879.92 --> 5883.92
you're massive okay you mean you're a

5882.4 --> 5885.599999999999
fat [ __ ]

5883.92 --> 5886.639
them versus them versus us yeah i

5885.6 --> 5891.0
believe you

5886.639 --> 5891.0
because see you're right in front of me

5898.4 --> 5902.879999999999
foreign

5901.119 --> 5904.96
good picture in my head of what you

5902.88 --> 5907.52
probably look like

5904.96 --> 5908.88
not that i necessarily want to stare at

5907.52 --> 5910.56
that

5908.88 --> 5912.96
right

5910.56 --> 5915.96
but when you say massive yeah i bet you

5912.96 --> 5915.96
are

5929.84 --> 5933.92
what

5932.159 --> 5936.799999999999
origin

5933.92 --> 5939.4400000000005
can you show me the math that shows that

5936.8 --> 5942.56
have refracted horizon is higher or

5939.44 --> 5944.159
lower than a less refracted horizon

5942.56 --> 5948.2390000000005
no i can't

5944.159 --> 5949.599999999999
you know why because it doesn't exist

5948.239 --> 5954.718999999999
you dummy

5949.6 --> 5956.8
the horizon cannot be refracted

5954.719 --> 5958.08
that's not part of the

5956.8 --> 5960.56
spectrum

5958.08 --> 5962.0
of refraction effects that naturally

5960.56 --> 5964.719
occur

5962.0 --> 5967.199
specifically noted in the research

5964.719 --> 5970.159
everywhere in the effects

5967.199 --> 5972.48
that doesn't happen the horizon doesn't

5970.159 --> 5974.638999999999
displace in relation to the horizon so

5972.48 --> 5977.44
yeah i can't show you the math for that

5974.639 --> 5980.08
that's right because it doesn't exist

5977.44 --> 5983.36
that [ __ ] only exists within a paradigm

5980.08 --> 5985.679
of terrestrial r assuming refraction

5983.36 --> 5987.839999999999
and i don't care to get into that

5985.679 --> 5991.2390000000005
because it's complete machination and a

5987.84 --> 5991.2390000000005
waste of time

6026.4 --> 6030.719
so

6027.28 --> 6033.759999999999
the line drawn to the horizon would

6030.719 --> 6035.28
always be the same height

6033.76 --> 6036.400000000001
no

6035.28 --> 6039.199
well

6036.4 --> 6040.799999999999
yeah actually in a way it is

6039.199 --> 6042.159
but yeah that's

6040.8 --> 6045.4400000000005
the horizon

6042.159 --> 6047.679
can be closer by and further away

6045.44 --> 6049.199
and literally if you take a 2d still

6047.679 --> 6052.159
shot of that

6049.199 --> 6054.159
it will appear lower when it's closer by

6052.159 --> 6056.32
and further away when it's farther into

6054.159 --> 6058.32
the distance but that's not actually

6056.32 --> 6062.239
vertical displacement

6058.32 --> 6064.0
you see that's far away close by

6062.239 --> 6065.839999999999
it's perspective i know it's not

6064.0 --> 6069.52
included in the curvature calculation

6065.84 --> 6069.52
now that's very easy to overlook

6070.719 --> 6074.56
but what refraction definitely doesn't

6073.199 --> 6075.759999999999
do

6074.56 --> 6078.84
is take

6075.76 --> 6082.0
very far distant sites and then

6078.84 --> 6084.400000000001
significantly displace the horizon and

6082.0 --> 6086.159
objects and everything upward

6084.4 --> 6089.119
dramatically

6086.159 --> 6089.119
that can't happen

6089.44 --> 6094.159
right that's what i mean when i say the

6092.08 --> 6096.88
horizon doesn't

6094.159 --> 6098.879999999999
displace because of refraction

6096.88 --> 6100.88
terrestrial refraction

6098.88 --> 6103.1990000000005
that can't happen

6100.88 --> 6106.400000000001
it's not among the possibilities of what

6103.199 --> 6109.36
can come out of refraction effects

6106.4 --> 6112.96
but what can happen is that the horizon

6109.36 --> 6115.839999999999
might seem closer by or further away

6112.96 --> 6119.44
and that will in relation to the viewer

6115.84 --> 6119.4400000000005
change the angle slightly

6119.6 --> 6124.08
because if it's closer by it's going to

6121.44 --> 6124.08
seem lower

6124.159 --> 6131.638999999999
seem lower it's not actually lower

6128.639 --> 6131.639
right

6141.6 --> 6145.96
yeah thank you for that return to normal

6149.76 --> 6154.400000000001
so how does refraction change the angle

6151.92 --> 6157.84
relation to the sextant uh well it

6154.4 --> 6160.239
doesn't you know why

6157.84 --> 6162.56
because refraction

6160.239 --> 6165.678999999999
is negligible

6162.56 --> 6165.679
it's negligible

6168.96 --> 6173.04
you don't need to

6170.639 --> 6173.04
really

6173.119 --> 6177.199
yeah figure out calculate for fraction

6175.44 --> 6179.759999999999
when you use a sextant because it's

6177.199 --> 6182.159
negligible

6179.76 --> 6184.4800000000005
right you don't zoom in

6182.159 --> 6187.759999999999
on the horizon

6184.48 --> 6187.759999999999
when you use a sextant

6187.84 --> 6191.84
so it's all completely negligible

6207.679 --> 6210.4
no i'm not

6214.48 --> 6219.119
you're just saying that doesn't make it

6216.4 --> 6223.04
true no what i said is true refraction

6219.119 --> 6226.5599999999995
is negligible for all practical purposes

6223.04 --> 6226.56
refraction is negligible

6228.4 --> 6234.719
real refraction only takes place in very

6231.28 --> 6237.679
far away distant sites anyway

6234.719 --> 6239.92
with the normal eye you don't get to see

6237.679 --> 6242.159
them after you really have to have a

6239.92 --> 6246.639
good high resolution camera and zoom in

6242.159 --> 6249.28
to even see a lot of refraction effects

6246.639 --> 6252.08
so it's overall negligible and that's a

6249.28 --> 6254.88
fact i'm not debunking the sexton i'm

6252.08 --> 6257.44
simply refuting your notion that

6254.88 --> 6260.0
refraction changes the angle it's just

6257.44 --> 6261.759999999999
not true you're just wrong and i'm not

6260.0 --> 6265.04
debunking

6261.76 --> 6269.1990000000005
the flat earth sextant argument by by

6265.04 --> 6269.199
making that statement yeah

6272.96 --> 6277.88
yeah

6273.76 --> 6277.88
that's right it isn't

6303.36 --> 6307.839999999999
you can't guess like me into making a

6305.6 --> 6312.4800000000005
mistake about this okay

6307.84 --> 6312.4800000000005
i know you like to try it doesn't work

6312.639 --> 6318.0
we're not gonna make that error

6317.04 --> 6319.36
right

6318.0 --> 6321.76
if it didn't

6319.36 --> 6324.0
have certainty about what i'm talking

6321.76 --> 6325.84
about concerning this subject

6324.0 --> 6327.84
then i would say that and i would just

6325.84 --> 6330.2390000000005
say like yeah i don't know for sure like

6327.84 --> 6332.639
ask 10th man he knows absolutely

6330.239 --> 6336.08
everything that relates to the sextant

6332.639 --> 6336.08
like he's specialized in that

6337.04 --> 6342.32
but i know enough to make that statement

6339.84 --> 6345.6
yeah refraction is negligible it's not

6342.32 --> 6346.799999999999
part of working with the sexton

6345.6 --> 6349.8
it's not

6346.8 --> 6349.8
important

6369.92 --> 6373.4400000000005
really well said by the way their return

6371.679 --> 6375.92
to normal

6373.44 --> 6378.0
i really like that statement

6375.92 --> 6380.639
i have to admire your dedication to this

6378.0 --> 6382.8
non-existent gotcha that you think you

6380.639 --> 6386.04
have is well said

6382.8 --> 6386.04
like that

6391.44 --> 6397.119
oh dear you still don't have an argument

6394.4 --> 6399.679
refraction is still negligible is not a

6397.119 --> 6402.799999999999
part of working with the sextant oh dear

6399.679 --> 6405.96
yeah you haven't addressed that right

6402.8 --> 6405.96
at all

6418.8 --> 6422.2390000000005
i'm gonna try the

6420.48 --> 6426.599999999999
toilet again

6422.239 --> 6426.599999999999
and then i'm gonna run out when i'm back

6516.08 --> 6519.08
hmm

6531.199 --> 6534.44
all right

6547.76 --> 6551.360000000001
hmm

6549.52 --> 6553.84
yeah rob h

6551.36 --> 6555.839999999999
return to normal ielts g i think that

6553.84 --> 6558.400000000001
denver's them versus us

6555.84 --> 6560.08
thinks he really has a gotcha but he

6558.4 --> 6562.32
seems to overlook that he doesn't

6560.08 --> 6563.92
actually fully understand what he's

6562.32 --> 6566.08
talking about

6563.92 --> 6567.679
so he must be going on intuition right

6566.08 --> 6571.76
now

6567.679 --> 6576.08
and yeah when you are a religious zealot

6571.76 --> 6578.4800000000005
that intuition plays tricks on you a lot

6576.08 --> 6578.48
this is

6578.639 --> 6583.84
he still thinks that he actually has an

6580.48 --> 6583.839999999999
argument that's hilarious

6605.04 --> 6608.4
yep

6606.96 --> 6611.679
oh wow

6608.4 --> 6614.48
you actually got the hint

6611.679 --> 6614.4800000000005
what is this

6616.159 --> 6620.799999999999
are you just trying to mimic that and

6618.88 --> 6622.88
then fake it out

6620.8 --> 6625.76
that would be kind of the thing to do

6622.88 --> 6630.52
for a ball or zealot

6625.76 --> 6630.52
whatever it doesn't really matter anyway

6641.28 --> 6644.719
anyone know how much these shows cost me

6643.84 --> 6649.96
to put

6644.719 --> 6649.96
hey i'm right here dude i'm right here

6652.32 --> 6656.719
what does it cost me

6655.28 --> 6660.96
nothing

6656.719 --> 6663.44
it cost my time because my dedication

6660.96 --> 6666.76
costs

6663.44 --> 6666.759999999999
some electricity

6667.199 --> 6672.4
and well if you want quality out of me

6669.92 --> 6675.4
then it's gonna require some financial

6672.4 --> 6675.4
support

6718.96 --> 6726.2390000000005
trying to say to nathan yes oh you mean

6723.119 --> 6729.28
in another argument

6726.239 --> 6731.5199999999995
them versus them versus us yeah i know

6729.28 --> 6734.32
the horizon effect is not the issue with

6731.52 --> 6736.8
the sextant because that's another

6734.32 --> 6739.36
argument we know

6736.8 --> 6741.679
it's very easy to just bob

6739.36 --> 6743.759999999999
into something else and then pretend

6741.679 --> 6746.639
like it's the same argument but we don't

6743.76 --> 6747.92
fall for that [ __ ] you see

6746.639 --> 6750.159000000001
because when

6747.92 --> 6752.8
the argument about the nature of the

6750.159 --> 6754.0
horizon and its claim geometry is

6752.8 --> 6756.56
discussed

6754.0 --> 6758.0
that's something completely different in

6756.56 --> 6761.679
relation to

6758.0 --> 6763.199
mechanical operation of a sextant yeah

6761.679 --> 6765.84
what do you think you could just slip

6763.199 --> 6765.839999999999
that in there

6766.32 --> 6769.44
without me noticing

6770.96 --> 6776.2390000000005
so you disagree with nathan then no

6773.599 --> 6779.119000000001
no i don't it's another argument

6776.239 --> 6780.159
has nothing to do with it

6779.119 --> 6782.88
yeah

6780.159 --> 6785.36
the nature of the horizon

6782.88 --> 6787.679
and terrestrial refraction black swan

6785.36 --> 6789.839999999999
radius value yeah that the title of the

6787.679 --> 6792.4
show

6789.84 --> 6797.04
is completely different from how to

6792.4 --> 6797.04
operate a sextant you get it

6797.679 --> 6805.28
and when we say refraction is negligible

6802.88 --> 6807.04
in the operating of a sextant we're

6805.28 --> 6808.88
talking about

6807.04 --> 6811.28
actual

6808.88 --> 6812.08
refraction which does exist

6811.28 --> 6813.0
right

6812.08 --> 6816.159
not

6813.0 --> 6817.36
terrestrial refraction

6816.159 --> 6820.32
because

6817.36 --> 6822.159
that can't work with this accident at

6820.32 --> 6824.639
all

6822.159 --> 6826.638999999999
if terrestrial refraction was real if

6824.639 --> 6828.4800000000005
the earth was actually a globe there was

6826.639 --> 6830.56
terrestrial refraction or even if there

6828.48 --> 6835.839999999999
wasn't terrestrial refraction the

6830.56 --> 6835.84
sextant would not be operable

6843.199 --> 6847.598999999999
no it doesn't

6845.28 --> 6849.44
dude you can't

6847.599 --> 6852.159000000001
tie these things together you got to

6849.44 --> 6854.799999999999
stop trying to ram

6852.159 --> 6856.719
that puzzle piece in that spot it's not

6854.8 --> 6858.719
supposed to be there you're trying to

6856.719 --> 6862.44
force something to connect that doesn't

6858.719 --> 6862.44
it doesn't work dude

6864.159 --> 6870.04
you're you're being really desperate now

6866.239 --> 6870.04
it's it's getting annoying

6904.08 --> 6908.96
no you guys are now gaslighting me it's

6906.239 --> 6908.959999999999
not gonna work

6917.04 --> 6923.679
no no you're a filthy liar you're a liar

6921.52 --> 6926.159000000001
this is where i draw the line i will ban

6923.679 --> 6926.159
you now

6927.44 --> 6932.159
never mind i'm not gonna ban you

6930.08 --> 6935.119
i'll ban you tomorrow i'll just leave

6932.159 --> 6938.719
all this garbage you puked out

6935.119 --> 6941.598999999999
right in here for everybody to see

6938.719 --> 6943.44
right so they can keep more easily track

6941.599 --> 6946.4800000000005
of what i discussed

6943.44 --> 6949.5199999999995
but you are lying now you are a lying

6946.48 --> 6952.48
filthy scumbag you just went from a

6949.52 --> 6955.679
squirting religious fanatic loser

6952.48 --> 6957.36
to a full-on lying piece of [ __ ] demon

6955.679 --> 6959.1990000000005
now

6957.36 --> 6960.48
this is really bad

6959.199 --> 6962.879999999999
and i will not

6960.48 --> 6962.879999999999
have it

6963.76 --> 6968.639
you can't try to guess like me by

6965.92 --> 6970.56
connecting puzzle pieces that don't fit

6968.639 --> 6972.08
that you took out of context you are a

6970.56 --> 6973.52
liar

6972.08 --> 6976.159
and you could go

6973.52 --> 6978.159000000001
[ __ ] yourself

6976.159 --> 6979.679
tomorrow you're banned

6978.159 --> 6980.719
nobody touch

6979.679 --> 6982.719
it

6980.719 --> 6985.44
all right i'm gonna run out

6982.719 --> 6987.599
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6985.44 --> 6989.5199999999995

membership system join button that would

7010.56 --> 7014.400000000001
be much appreciated i can definitely

7026.36 --> 7029.5199999999995
1008

7028.0 --> 7031.36
and i'm gonna of course join the flat

7029.52 --> 7032.8

7031.36 --> 7035.04
minute now

7032.8 --> 7038.84
until the next video

7035.04 --> 7038.84
