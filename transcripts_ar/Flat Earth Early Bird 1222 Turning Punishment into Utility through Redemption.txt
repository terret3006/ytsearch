91.799 --> 94.56
right

93.299 --> 98.84
so

94.56 --> 98.84
today is it oh dear

100.439 --> 104.65899999999999
camera's still going yeah it's still

102.24 --> 104.65899999999999
going right

105.899 --> 110.84
it's a pretty nice spring day

112.439 --> 117.96
it's not super blue up there but it

115.38 --> 119.52
doesn't seem like it's from Trails it

117.96 --> 121.259
seems like there's just a lot of moist

119.52 --> 124.32
in here

121.259 --> 128.299
and there's a bunch of fluffy clouds but

124.32 --> 128.299
yes also the Sun

128.459 --> 131.53900000000002
there's a bit of wind

134.16 --> 138.42
so it's not super warm outside like this

137.099 --> 140.04
but

138.42 --> 143.78
yeah if you're behind the window or

140.04 --> 143.78
something I bet it's really nice

147.3 --> 154.08
and still yeah the the air the air is

150.48 --> 158.04
very fresh and refreshing

154.08 --> 161.18
so typically in the daytime Now open up

158.04 --> 161.17999999999998
all the windows in the house

161.519 --> 165.78
so that the air just keeps blowing

163.5 --> 167.519
through everything I got to be careful

165.78 --> 171.06
with the doors though because they do

167.519 --> 173.959
tend to Ram themselves shut

171.06 --> 173.959
you don't block them

176.519 --> 179.87900000000002
but yeah the fresh air is certainly

178.62 --> 182.87900000000002
welcome

179.879 --> 184.62
hello Jeff gas head first in chat tablet

182.879 --> 187.2
3006

184.62 --> 190.22
PJ CNET good to see you guys hello

187.2 --> 190.22
seeking star water

190.92 --> 198.05999999999997
it is Saturday the 23rd of April

195.06 --> 198.06
2022

199.92 --> 202.51899999999998
ah

205.099 --> 211.7
was just watching

208.2 --> 211.7
old Benjamin from yesterday

213.0 --> 219.06
it was very interesting

216.659 --> 221.519
like these are the type of things that

219.06 --> 223.98
truly interest me and I like it that

221.519 --> 227.0
he's interested in the same thing and he

223.98 --> 227.0
does a lot of digging

228.0 --> 234.959
being proficient in history and all that

231.48 --> 236.39999999999998
focusing on that even during his study

234.959 --> 239.599
age

236.4 --> 239.59900000000002
but yeah the whole

239.64 --> 243.77999999999997
again

241.5 --> 246.56
Thomas Jefferson

243.78 --> 246.56
and

247.2 --> 258.12
yeah Muslims and that he had a the Quran

253.379 --> 261.359
and like was was there ever a hostility

258.12 --> 263.699
and what do you call that anonymity

261.359 --> 265.85999999999996
towards Islam

263.699 --> 269.479
from them and it doesn't really seem

265.86 --> 269.47900000000004
like it but there was a competition

269.58 --> 274.94
right

271.02 --> 274.94
like there was a trade war going on

275.04 --> 280.02000000000004
with the berbers and they were Islamic

278.46 --> 282.78
and

280.02 --> 284.94
yeah own Benjamin reasoned out that and

282.78 --> 286.44
it seems very logical that he studied

284.94 --> 289.259
Islam

286.44 --> 290.639
to kind of understand them better and

289.259 --> 294.0
then be able to

290.639 --> 295.8
well do with them as a competing trade

294.0 --> 298.139
Empire Force

295.8 --> 300.78000000000003
and it makes perfect sense to me

298.139 --> 303.919
but yeah the apparently the Quran is

300.78 --> 303.919
still in his Temple

305.52 --> 310.79999999999995
and yeah

308.46 --> 313.25899999999996
he was never like oh look I can't wait

310.8 --> 315.06
to get rid of this book now that I'm

313.259 --> 317.699
that I know what I need to know or

315.06 --> 320.34
anything he respected it because it's in

317.699 --> 322.8
his Temple it's just very interesting

320.34 --> 326.71999999999997
show I'm kind of halfway

322.8 --> 326.72
but yeah very inspiring

327.3 --> 332.759
hello tree Bob

330.96 --> 336.919
m

332.759 --> 336.91900000000004
what Peter Griffin what

346.02 --> 353.399
um

347.26 --> 353.399
[Music]

363.479 --> 369.36
it's also for me it's very interesting

366.24 --> 373.919
to like reflect on shows like that oh

369.36 --> 376.319
Benjamin does it the historical study

373.919 --> 377.88
especially concerning religions and

376.319 --> 379.62
Empire

377.88 --> 382.56
it's really interesting to me because

379.62 --> 385.44
now in this age I know so much more

382.56 --> 388.74
about how things really work

385.44 --> 392.539
when I was much younger

388.74 --> 394.38
all these things out there

392.539 --> 397.38
Islam and

394.38 --> 397.38
Christianity

397.56 --> 403.8
they were also oversimplified based on

401.16 --> 407.52000000000004
very sparing

403.8 --> 409.5
information and opinions about it

407.52 --> 412.31899999999996
because it kind of scared me when I was

409.5 --> 413.88
younger like like I was just afraid like

412.319 --> 416.759
people get fanatical and I didn't

413.88 --> 419.34
understand it and that scared me

416.759 --> 420.12
right now I now understand it's so much

419.34 --> 422.71999999999997
better

420.12 --> 422.72
but

424.139 --> 429.66
I'm just reflecting upon like learning

426.84 --> 433.81899999999996
about this let's say

429.66 --> 433.819
25 or more years ago

434.099 --> 438.599
in my teens still and then learning

436.5 --> 441.06
about like oh yeah I had a Quran and you

438.599 --> 442.86
respected the Quran and I probably back

441.06 --> 445.56
then like that was like I don't

442.86 --> 448.74
understand that kind of scares me

445.56 --> 450.479
like that makes him a bit suspicious

448.74 --> 452.759
like that impulse because I didn't

450.479 --> 454.44
understand what it was

452.759 --> 458.16
but now

454.44 --> 459.78
I got like even more respect because I

458.16 --> 462.36
do understand

459.78 --> 463.55999999999995
it's just really interesting to connect

462.36 --> 466.58000000000004
that up

463.56 --> 466.58
throughout my life

468.3 --> 474.96000000000004
also gives me a better view on like how

471.66 --> 477.3
I was actually deluded

474.96 --> 479.94
back then and that I really couldn't

477.3 --> 483.84000000000003
reach out of it that much I just didn't

479.94 --> 486.78
have to the faculties the wisdom

483.84 --> 488.58
to grasp the true nature the true

486.78 --> 492.419
frequency of it all in order to put it

488.58 --> 496.02
into a realistic context

492.419 --> 500.12
and I'm much better now

496.02 --> 500.12
anyway hello Crockett

508.319 --> 514.32
right so yeah one thing that my very

511.5 --> 516.8
slow Awakening one could say in certain

514.32 --> 518.94
ways I was always like

516.8 --> 521.3389999999999
mechanically awakened at a very young

518.94 --> 524.0390000000001
age it just had this pure system readily

521.339 --> 525.1800000000001
available but I kind of like leaned on

524.039 --> 528.0
it

525.18 --> 530.6999999999999
it decreased from The Challenge that I

528.0 --> 533.76
was facing in the world

530.7 --> 536.4590000000001
that made me more isolated

533.76 --> 537.899
naturally like that's I didn't know any

536.459 --> 539.9399999999999
of that it's just like I have these

537.899 --> 542.04
things available I'm like yeah I'm using

539.94 --> 544.2
it I'm not going to be discouraged in

542.04 --> 547.38
using that I'm gonna especially like

544.2 --> 548.88
very focused on myself not so much on

547.38 --> 552.74
interconnecting with other people or

548.88 --> 552.74
even trying to understand them that much

552.899 --> 555.09
right

554.459 --> 557.279
huh

555.09 --> 559.6800000000001
[Music]

557.279 --> 563.459
but now

559.68 --> 566.0999999999999
I spent half a lifetime basically

563.459 --> 568.56
realizing that connecting is a challenge

566.1 --> 571.32
and understanding is a challenge but I

568.56 --> 574.16
have this mechanical

571.32 --> 578.279
thing Talent

574.16 --> 581.519
structurizing like on a micro scale

578.279 --> 583.74
and it's like it's fractal I I've

581.519 --> 585.72
interconnected it with time for myself

583.74 --> 588.72
in the modeling

585.72 --> 588.72
apparently

589.8 --> 593.3599999999999
so what my subconscious does

594.42 --> 597.019
huh

601.56 --> 607.8
but right yeah back then

604.38 --> 610.26
with how I was I was doing things I

607.8 --> 612.959
wasn't really able to get things and

610.26 --> 615.54
even in like conversational interactions

612.959 --> 618.5999999999999
with people that were wiser but were not

615.54 --> 621.12
super mechanically talented necessarily

618.6 --> 624.12
but good enough in explaining usually

621.12 --> 626.9590000000001
parents that helps being a parent you

624.12 --> 626.9590000000001
helps a lot

627.54 --> 632.899
in being able to communicate with me I

630.779 --> 632.899
think

635.339 --> 638.94
because you as a parent you're going to

637.079 --> 642.62
face like all kinds of frequencies from

638.94 --> 642.62
your kid and you must deal with it

642.899 --> 648.6
and that way you

644.94 --> 651.3000000000001
will be will have more Dynamic available

648.6 --> 653.64
for yourself to interact with me

651.3 --> 656.8389999999999
because I am weird

653.64 --> 656.8389999999999
and complicated

658.86 --> 663.6
on the other hand I'm really easy going

660.72 --> 665.519
now but back then I I wasn't back then I

663.6 --> 667.38
was always trying to push boundaries I

665.519 --> 669.0
was always like I need to apply this I

667.38 --> 671.899
need to apply this

669.0 --> 671.899
but it didn't connect

672.54 --> 677.459
a lot of people thought I was just crazy

674.519 --> 680.64
and in ways I thought I was just crazy

677.459 --> 685.6999999999999
because the isolation

680.64 --> 685.6999999999999
desperation Factor started seeping in

693.18 --> 698.459
where does crop circle patterns fall

696.18 --> 701.16
into fractal thinking

698.459 --> 704.279
uh

701.16 --> 706.8
well they're stimulating they're

704.279 --> 709.38
inspiring aren't they

706.8 --> 712.5
remind me of

709.38 --> 715.68
like mechanical constellations that

712.5 --> 719.04
would be used for atom models

715.68 --> 720.779
for uh yeah Stellar models right even

719.04 --> 724.4399999999999
though that's fiction

720.779 --> 727.5
but also Electronics right it's always

724.44 --> 729.9200000000001
on a flat thing it's just it's both it's

727.5 --> 733.68
constellations and electronics and it is

729.92 --> 735.36
they're they're basically attempted

733.68 --> 739.56
glyphs

735.36 --> 740.82
which is kind of like magical symbols

739.56 --> 744.42
they have

740.82 --> 748.9200000000001
things they affects

744.42 --> 753.42
like the patterns but

748.92 --> 757.6999999999999
that's the patterns in themselves right

753.42 --> 757.6999999999999
and a lot of them seem very

758.839 --> 765.6
man thinking skill designed so I think

763.139 --> 768.6
that they were all designed by men

765.6 --> 771.6
and that they applied this trick to do

768.6 --> 774.12
that I think it's all man-made

771.6 --> 775.32
but high-tech stuff they're like this is

774.12 --> 778.2
like

775.32 --> 781.2
super secret society [ __ ] but it's like

778.2 --> 785.839
one of their big magical tricks maybe

781.2 --> 785.839
it's even relatively recent I don't know

789.06 --> 793.68
crop circles for 40 years

791.579 --> 797.779
yeah

793.68 --> 797.779
I bet I was a bit into it

804.12 --> 809.94
I think I even like saw a few

807.42 --> 812.04
not but I'm not sure about that

809.94 --> 814.5600000000001
it's like yeah with my first girlfriend

812.04 --> 816.36
she was really into UFO so it also into

814.56 --> 818.88
crop circles

816.36 --> 820.98
remember if we actually went to a place

818.88 --> 824.16
like that anymore that's

820.98 --> 826.26
yeah it's 25 years ago

824.16 --> 828.24
24.

826.26 --> 830.54
I don't remember what we were doing at

828.24 --> 830.54
the time

833.339 --> 835.94
but

836.339 --> 843.6
I think yeah whatever it is it

839.519 --> 844.94
it seemed the pat look I

843.6 --> 849.36
I like

844.94 --> 851.22
derive intelligence levels from patterns

849.36 --> 854.5790000000001
so there's a pattern coming out of

851.22 --> 858.48
somebody I can immediately size up

854.579 --> 862.1389999999999
like what's going on in their

858.48 --> 865.44
syntax mechanism

862.139 --> 868.8
it's a way of frequency dividing it's

865.44 --> 871.9200000000001
very telling especially because artists

868.8 --> 873.779
typically hang on to a certain frequency

871.92 --> 875.279
and that expresses itself in art and

873.779 --> 877.079
then they're impressed by it and then

875.279 --> 878.519
they kind of hang on to it or keep

877.079 --> 882.3599999999999
improving even

878.519 --> 885.66
so you can read what's going on in a

882.36 --> 887.839
person based on the patterns of their

885.66 --> 887.8389999999999
art

888.06 --> 894.8389999999999
and yeah gets even weirder

891.12 --> 896.76
when I also shared that that account for

894.839 --> 901.2600000000001
speaking

896.76 --> 902.639
for narrative craft word smithing

901.26 --> 905.279
both

902.639 --> 908.42
but that's yeah it's a different type of

905.279 --> 908.42
mechanism they're separate

908.76 --> 914.04
but already like the syntax of course of

911.459 --> 916.9799999999999
somebody's mechanical system internal

914.04 --> 919.8
workings or will always show themselves

916.98 --> 922.38
it just the way

919.8 --> 924.3
and they talk

922.38 --> 926.3389999999999
the word range

924.3 --> 927.4799999999999
and what they like to do with that word

926.339 --> 930.9590000000001
range

927.48 --> 936.0
and what they're seeking out

930.959 --> 936.0
with their mental Endeavors anyway

949.32 --> 953.94
is it really man-made they happen in an

952.44 --> 955.1990000000001
instant

953.94 --> 960.72
well

955.199 --> 963.7199999999999
not handmade my man territ 306

960.72 --> 966.5
there is high tech going on

963.72 --> 966.5
pretty sure

968.639 --> 973.8
but

970.44 --> 975.1800000000001
I'm saying that the patterns that we get

973.8 --> 979.639
to see

975.18 --> 979.6389999999999
are very recognizable to me

980.1 --> 984.0790000000001
in what I'm seeing

984.36 --> 991.62
life made I literally made it's still a

987.959 --> 994.56
website a study about patterns okay

991.62 --> 998.22
and how to read them even

994.56 --> 999.76
on symbolics.nl my website from like

998.22 --> 1001.279
2006.

999.76 --> 1004.699
[Music]

1001.279 --> 1006.62
I made a very deep study about that on

1004.699 --> 1009.92
an intuitive level and attempted to

1006.62 --> 1015.94
basically give a framework for that

1009.92 --> 1015.9399999999999
like how it is like how to look

1016.459 --> 1022.3
and what you can derive from patterns

1019.88 --> 1022.3
typically

1023.3 --> 1028.22
to basically start crawling in

1025.459 --> 1030.76
somebody's mind potentially

1028.22 --> 1030.76
anyway

1031.459 --> 1037.8390000000002
crop circle connector one of the

1034.16 --> 1037.8390000000002
original sources for info all right

1053.92 --> 1057.009
[Music]

1059.95 --> 1065.3600000000001
[Music]

1062.539 --> 1067.52
what I'd be interested in seeking Star

1065.36 --> 1069.32
Wars if you're really into that and if

1067.52 --> 1071.4189999999999
you are proficient with like dealing

1069.32 --> 1074.5
with data right because it's all so much

1071.419 --> 1074.5
freaking data

1074.84 --> 1078.9189999999999
it would be interesting to kind of like

1076.88 --> 1082.3600000000001
try to cross connect where the crop

1078.919 --> 1082.3600000000001
circles have all appeared

1082.46 --> 1088.4
where mostly

1084.38 --> 1090.919
and then try to cross connect it with

1088.4 --> 1094.94
secret societies

1090.919 --> 1096.5
where they typically gather for example

1094.94 --> 1098.72
right

1096.5 --> 1100.76
because I really think that it crop

1098.72 --> 1103.82
circles come from like a

1100.76 --> 1106.1
it's like a play they do

1103.82 --> 1108.62
secretly I've never actually heard

1106.1 --> 1113.26
anybody connected to that

1108.62 --> 1113.26
like directly say that to me

1114.32 --> 1119.4189999999999
or maybe they kind of like hinted at it

1116.9 --> 1122.24
to but I thought it was a bluff right

1119.419 --> 1124.76
because the guy was always bluffing that

1122.24 --> 1127.72
they were all powerful

1124.76 --> 1127.72
like to me

1130.1 --> 1135.1999999999998
so yeah

1131.9 --> 1138.8200000000002
there is reasonable suspicion for me to

1135.2 --> 1143.8400000000001
believe that crop circles are actually

1138.82 --> 1146.5
man-made using very unique you could say

1143.84 --> 1148.22
Tesla era technology probably

1146.5 --> 1150.799
[Music]

1148.22 --> 1153.02
it for sure it has something to do with

1150.799 --> 1156.3799999999999
electrics that there is or even like

1153.02 --> 1158.84
plasma but we don't know what the device

1156.38 --> 1160.94
is they use for that like maybe they

1158.84 --> 1164.78
figured out how to freaking do it with

1160.94 --> 1167.539
like radio projection or something even

1164.78 --> 1171.98
I don't know I don't know exactly how to

1167.539 --> 1173.96
do it but I do know that the designs

1171.98 --> 1176.74
that they do make which get very

1173.96 --> 1180.14
complicated especially more recently

1176.74 --> 1182.6200000000001
compared to like old early 20th century

1180.14 --> 1182.6200000000001
sightings

1182.679 --> 1189.76
they're like

1185.059 --> 1189.76
what man could make on a computer

1191.66 --> 1194.2
you see

1195.08 --> 1202.3999999999999
it's not that alien it's not that like

1198.559 --> 1206.96
what is this this is not

1202.4 --> 1208.52
it seems very much designed by it by men

1206.96 --> 1210.2
to me

1208.52 --> 1212.84
like I

1210.2 --> 1215.1200000000001
even had impulses seeing those the first

1212.84 --> 1217.1589999999999
time like oh I can make that and I would

1215.12 --> 1219.8799999999999
literally like draw my own crop circle

1217.159 --> 1219.88
patterns

1221.059 --> 1225.08
like sketch them out a bit and then I

1223.52 --> 1227.96
got bored

1225.08 --> 1230.6589999999999
so because that's just

1227.96 --> 1234.52
that looked like art class to me like oh

1230.659 --> 1234.5200000000002
that's a very interesting glyph

1234.799 --> 1238.22
it's very inspiring and there's all

1236.48 --> 1242.2
kinds of things you can see in that and

1238.22 --> 1242.2
what does it remind you of right

1251.12 --> 1255.4399999999998
yeah that's right BJC that they're

1253.4 --> 1257.48
definitely not caused by aliens from

1255.44 --> 1260.659
outer space

1257.48 --> 1263.26
but since that is also a secret society

1260.659 --> 1263.2600000000002
story

1263.419 --> 1268.4
right

1265.6 --> 1271.24
they tie it in

1268.4 --> 1271.24
because they can

1271.46 --> 1277.6000000000001
because yeah nobody knows like these

1273.919 --> 1277.6000000000001
outer these crop circles made

1280.1 --> 1285.1399999999999
not really

1281.6 --> 1287.0
maybe some plants like in meetings or

1285.14 --> 1288.98
whatever that do know just to see what's

1287.0 --> 1293.5
going on no nothing gets out of hand

1288.98 --> 1293.5
nobody spills the beans or something but

1293.6 --> 1298.2199999999998
yeah

1296.12 --> 1300.08
in general people really don't

1298.22 --> 1303.5
understand like what's going on with

1300.08 --> 1307.6589999999999
these crop circles I didn't when I was

1303.5 --> 1307.659
like getting into that at 18

1309.98 --> 1314.299
. yeah exactly yeah I know but I

1312.08 --> 1317.96
remember stocks of the plants explode

1314.299 --> 1320.78
they like microwave it just

1317.96 --> 1323.96
they like it's a controlled microwave

1320.78 --> 1325.94
burst that's what it seems like

1323.96 --> 1328.58
it's just like an energy field they

1325.94 --> 1330.919
project and just like

1328.58 --> 1332.6589999999999
it breaks and it snaps in a very

1330.919 --> 1334.8500000000001
specific Direction and then everything

1332.659 --> 1336.0800000000002
just folds it's

1334.85 --> 1338.4189999999999
[Music]

1336.08 --> 1341.86
it's art

1338.419 --> 1341.8600000000001
isn't it it's art

1343.76 --> 1349.82
the Precision they achieve with it

1347.059 --> 1351.98
like that cannot be handmade like people

1349.82 --> 1355.0
can't do that

1351.98 --> 1355.0
just by hand

1357.62 --> 1360.3999999999999
that's right

1363.799 --> 1367.22
it's like high-tech

1365.82 --> 1370.8799999999999
[Music]

1367.22 --> 1373.22
electric Fields manipulated

1370.88 --> 1375.44
braiding

1373.22 --> 1378.1000000000001
that's what they can do with it

1375.44 --> 1378.1000000000001
it's art

1378.2 --> 1380.919
secret art

1381.08 --> 1387.1999999999998
and they attribute it to a mysterious

1383.679 --> 1389.419
thing that they can then shape they can

1387.2 --> 1392.72
they latch on to people's imagination

1389.419 --> 1396.5200000000002
and then they plant their stories their

1392.72 --> 1396.52
narratives that they want like aliens

1397.88 --> 1404.0
see that's the trick that's like a

1402.38 --> 1407.0
rudimentary

1404.0 --> 1409.28
mechanism even in Freemasonry it's like

1407.0 --> 1412.039
the general way of doing things it's

1409.28 --> 1415.1
what they're there for

1412.039 --> 1417.5
they do magic tricks that are like super

1415.1 --> 1420.3799999999999
mysterious

1417.5 --> 1422.84
then they use that Fascination and they

1420.38 --> 1425.6000000000001
latch on a story narrative that they

1422.84 --> 1429.82
want the people to believe in

1425.6 --> 1429.82
for marketing purposes basically

1430.58 --> 1434.6789999999999
it's industrialized Magic

1445.64 --> 1450.22
oh dear got a derp alert

1461.84 --> 1467.6
they started in about the 1990s

1466.159 --> 1470.38
well

1467.6 --> 1470.3799999999999
they did

1477.1 --> 1484.039
well it I know that the crop circle

1480.32 --> 1486.32
amounts increased a lot around that time

1484.039 --> 1487.7
they started like popping out all over

1486.32 --> 1489.74
the place but

1487.7 --> 1491.059
I think there's been very early crop

1489.74 --> 1494.539
circles too

1491.059 --> 1497.36
you could say that those might have been

1494.539 --> 1500.0
insufficiently

1497.36 --> 1502.6399999999999
effective they weren't convincing enough

1500.0 --> 1504.74
so they kept them off the Record like oh

1502.64 --> 1505.8200000000002
that would obviously man-made yeah no

1504.74 --> 1509.299
[ __ ]

1505.82 --> 1512.48
yeah just like the new ones too except

1509.299 --> 1514.72
they have advanced technology to do that

1512.48 --> 1514.72
now

1515.84 --> 1522.1399999999999
oh but it's aliens see see how simple

1520.159 --> 1526.659
it really is

1522.14 --> 1526.659
you just put the pieces together

1528.32 --> 1531.82
majority in England right

1536.779 --> 1542.6
just read the 70s

1540.08 --> 1546.34
what

1542.6 --> 1546.34
are you talking about Jared Sanford

1555.919 --> 1562.7
yeah I got bacon in the 90s

1558.14 --> 1564.94
that's me 98. that was me getting into

1562.7 --> 1564.94
it

1566.659 --> 1570.98
so I got in pretty late stage when

1568.94 --> 1572.659
everything was already pretty digested

1570.98 --> 1575.9
and a lot of people doing that were

1572.659 --> 1579.2600000000002
already comfortable doing that

1575.9 --> 1581.659
and then I yeah got in there and had

1579.26 --> 1586.34
this interesting experience

1581.659 --> 1587.48
a UFO Gathering thing it was like a flat

1586.34 --> 1591.02
Earth

1587.48 --> 1593.48
meet up except it wasn't flat Earth it

1591.02 --> 1597.46
was crop circles

1593.48 --> 1600.6200000000001
alien abduction stories and like

1597.46 --> 1602.9
divining art basically people make it

1600.62 --> 1605.6
showing Pat like

1602.9 --> 1608.659
making patterns in art and saying that

1605.6 --> 1610.8799999999999
it was channeled to them by an alien

1608.659 --> 1614.1200000000001
that was that that was what that was

1610.88 --> 1617.659
that was the entire thing and I was very

1614.12 --> 1620.6589999999999
fascinated by that and I tested people

1617.659 --> 1623.779
I tested like

1620.659 --> 1626.2990000000002
like they have an ability do they really

1623.779 --> 1629.12
know what it is that they're doing

1626.299 --> 1631.76
because I would recognize what it is

1629.12 --> 1633.4399999999998
like on an intuitive level like you're

1631.76 --> 1635.779
doing this

1633.44 --> 1638.179
but they would have their own belief

1635.779 --> 1641.24
structure developed on kind of

1638.179 --> 1643.3400000000001
platitudes and typical

1641.24 --> 1646.279
basic thinking

1643.34 --> 1648.6789999999999
I can really made me do it right

1646.279 --> 1650.419
or not people that are like oh we were

1648.679 --> 1653.24
yeah we were the aliens came for us

1650.419 --> 1655.64
again and I'm like okay

1653.24 --> 1658.3990000000001
were you using drugs at the time

1655.64 --> 1662.2990000000002
like I'm okay with that like yeah yeah

1658.399 --> 1663.9189999999999
yeah oh okay so do you remember standing

1662.299 --> 1665.6589999999999
up

1663.919 --> 1668.0590000000002
and like

1665.659 --> 1670.279
opening the window or the door and

1668.059 --> 1672.9189999999999
moving out as you were

1670.279 --> 1675.02
getting going towards the ship and

1672.919 --> 1677.2990000000002
they're like no no everything just

1675.02 --> 1679.76
changed and we were like pulled in by a

1677.299 --> 1683.059
beam and there was no more house

1679.76 --> 1685.82
okay then well that means there wasn't

1683.059 --> 1690.1589999999999
physical reality that means you were

1685.82 --> 1690.1589999999999
having a extra dimensional experience

1690.26 --> 1695.36
they were basically entities and they

1692.84 --> 1698.24
were pulling you in

1695.36 --> 1701.779
and they were like what the [ __ ]

1698.24 --> 1704.36
oh I don't understand they were like

1701.779 --> 1706.58
yeah they're super drugged out like

1704.36 --> 1710.24
those guys were like Junkies

1706.58 --> 1711.86
they're nice junkies not like super sick

1710.24 --> 1714.919
freaks

1711.86 --> 1717.62
but kind of slo-mos like hippies but

1714.919 --> 1719.6000000000001
really junky hippies but they were on

1717.62 --> 1721.8799999999999
that convention giving their testimony

1719.6 --> 1723.799
about their UFO Abduction experience and

1721.88 --> 1725.659
I inquired them in private didn't shame

1723.799 --> 1727.8799999999999
them right it was just like hey I got

1725.659 --> 1730.1000000000001
these questions to figure it out like

1727.88 --> 1732.0800000000002
what was it actually that they

1730.1 --> 1734.7199999999998
experienced they probably don't realize

1732.08 --> 1737.5
I can figure it out

1734.72 --> 1742.539
see and that was in

1737.5 --> 1742.539
2000 and 1998 I was doing that

1744.62 --> 1748.9399999999998
do you believe we're the only ones in

1747.32 --> 1752.08
the universe

1748.94 --> 1752.0800000000002
what does that mean

1754.1 --> 1758.86
like can you be more specific Dr Dino

1761.059 --> 1767.6589999999999
I mean in this realm we the only one

1765.14 --> 1768.74
excuse me but we share this realm with

1767.659 --> 1772.779
like

1768.74 --> 1775.64
a hundred billion different separated

1772.779 --> 1779.38
sort of life forms

1775.64 --> 1779.38
no we're not the only one

1787.46 --> 1793.279
is there other life out there well

1791.24 --> 1795.5
it all depends on how you're gonna see

1793.279 --> 1797.96
out there it's not a bad question you

1795.5 --> 1799.94
know it's very basic it's not a bad

1797.96 --> 1801.679
question like even in the Flat Earth

1799.94 --> 1804.74
conception that there's no outer space

1801.679 --> 1807.159
in other planets right because

1804.74 --> 1810.74
do we know the full

1807.159 --> 1813.2
confine of our Realm

1810.74 --> 1814.88
no not really there could be

1813.2 --> 1818.659
Giant

1814.88 --> 1819.7990000000002
like continent-sized Island masses Out

1818.659 --> 1821.72
Of Reach

1819.799 --> 1824.48
where there are

1821.72 --> 1826.64
other type of humanoids right they're

1824.48 --> 1829.1
not the first one to say that like some

1826.64 --> 1832.3400000000001
people believe there's like blue skinned

1829.1 --> 1835.76
alien somewhere and or that they're

1832.34 --> 1840.3799999999999
still like just a full race of giants

1835.76 --> 1843.32
separated or that there's like weird

1840.38 --> 1846.88
elf-like creatures there's all kinds of

1843.32 --> 1846.8799999999999
ideas about that

1847.159 --> 1852.2600000000002
so there could be other humanoids they

1850.46 --> 1855.2
would be humanoid though there's no

1852.26 --> 1859.58
weird multiple tentacle

1855.2 --> 1862.76
Ricky alienoid mutant creatures that's

1859.58 --> 1865.399
sci-fi those don't exist I'm very

1862.76 --> 1868.0
certain of that

1865.399 --> 1868.0
right

1870.98 --> 1875.8990000000001
and who knows man maybe

1874.159 --> 1878.14
like when it comes to even Animal

1875.899 --> 1881.299
Kingdom there might be like

1878.14 --> 1883.5800000000002
proto-animals or even insects that are

1881.299 --> 1885.98
just super intelligent and can even like

1883.58 --> 1887.4189999999999
communicate with humans

1885.98 --> 1889.7
somewhere

1887.419 --> 1891.7990000000002
right and then

1889.7 --> 1893.779
that's still within the presupposition

1891.799 --> 1895.6399999999999
that it's like in the same Physical

1893.779 --> 1898.159
Realm

1895.64 --> 1900.919
but there might be other Realms that can

1898.159 --> 1904.5800000000002
periodically connect or never ever

1900.919 --> 1907.64
connect where there are other

1904.58 --> 1910.22
like civilizations there's it's just a

1907.64 --> 1914.72
separated Realm

1910.22 --> 1917.48
but it's very very likely that if there

1914.72 --> 1918.74
are any intelligent creatures there they

1917.48 --> 1921.559
would be

1918.74 --> 1925.159
humanoid as well

1921.559 --> 1926.84
maybe even like totally similar but they

1925.159 --> 1929.0800000000002
went their own development round who

1926.84 --> 1929.08
knows

1929.72 --> 1933.98
so

1931.58 --> 1937.1589999999999
no we're not like this Niche little

1933.98 --> 1939.279
corner of oh we just humanoid and oh

1937.159 --> 1943.7600000000002
there's all these

1939.279 --> 1947.019
six-legged aliens over there no no

1943.76 --> 1947.019
that's not happening

1954.32 --> 1956.799
right

1959.539 --> 1966.019
I mean whatever Realms are out there

1963.019 --> 1969.039
if they're out there then they were

1966.019 --> 1971.8990000000001
very likely part of the same original

1969.039 --> 1973.399
unified Realm

1971.899 --> 1975.6789999999999
once

1973.399 --> 1977.899
so everything that is pretty much in

1975.679 --> 1981.019
physical existence would have had One

1977.899 --> 1982.58
Singular original root for everything

1981.019 --> 1984.799
right

1982.58 --> 1986.559
there's something split off from our

1984.799 --> 1988.58
realm like

1986.559 --> 1991.34
unattainable because it's literally

1988.58 --> 1995.72
there is a

1991.34 --> 1997.399
a no space in between like it just

1995.72 --> 1999.32
doesn't connect the volumes don't

1997.399 --> 2002.6789999999999
connect

1999.32 --> 2006.1
all of those would still have originally

2002.679 --> 2006.1000000000001
been Unified

2007.48 --> 2013.0
like

2009.159 --> 2016.0590000000002
I I doubt that like oh our realm is Our

2013.0 --> 2019.059
God's realm and there are other Realms

2016.059 --> 2022.12
by completely different gods that are

2019.059 --> 2023.32
like like it's a garden right you I

2022.12 --> 2026.86
don't know

2023.32 --> 2029.1399999999999
it seems very unlikely because

2026.86 --> 2031.9599999999998
like

2029.14 --> 2033.8200000000002
it would be like a super Pantheon all

2031.96 --> 2036.76
over again

2033.82 --> 2038.5
and then even the consequences of like

2036.76 --> 2042.779
interconnecting Realms you would

2038.5 --> 2045.64
literally have the designer

2042.779 --> 2047.919
potentially getting in an argument with

2045.64 --> 2052.06
another designer and that could like

2047.919 --> 2054.399
absolutely [ __ ] everything up

2052.06 --> 2058.06
like the designs might not be compatible

2054.399 --> 2061.48
you see but you have a total different

2058.06 --> 2064.179
way of design and that might just not be

2061.48 --> 2066.579
compatible so they would never allow

2064.179 --> 2068.32
that to connect up then so it just just

2066.579 --> 2071.7400000000002
kind of seems pointless

2068.32 --> 2075.639
that there is for us

2071.74 --> 2079.859
to focus beyond beyond the designer of

2075.639 --> 2079.859
what we already see around us

2081.94 --> 2086.2000000000003
because I don't think we could ever

2083.56 --> 2088.96
connect up to anything that wasn't also

2086.2 --> 2092.1389999999997
designed by that Designer you see

2088.96 --> 2095.76
does that make logical sense

2092.139 --> 2095.76
from a designer's perspective

2100.66 --> 2106.2599999999998
there has to be something outside your

2102.64 --> 2106.2599999999998
Universe yeah well you would never know

2107.74 --> 2113.02
right

2109.18 --> 2116.9199999999996
there's already more sides to this

2113.02 --> 2118.42
universe than most can ever hope to to

2116.92 --> 2120.88
figure out

2118.42 --> 2124.02
there's the inward Dimensions there's

2120.88 --> 2124.02
like the Dark World

2124.9 --> 2130.3
and more

2126.88 --> 2131.5
there's like mechanics the sixth

2130.3 --> 2133.3
dimension

2131.5 --> 2135.52
rarely talk about it because I've only

2133.3 --> 2138.46
seen glimpses But the Glimpse is that I

2135.52 --> 2142.42
did see were pretty

2138.46 --> 2144.06
like just constant non-stop mind-blowing

2142.42 --> 2147.579
experience

2144.06 --> 2149.56
where what would be visually represented

2147.579 --> 2152.92
wasn't even the thing that blew my mind

2149.56 --> 2155.5
but just the sheer energy of it all

2152.92 --> 2157.48
Non-Stop mind-blowing

2155.5 --> 2160.78
right it's the architect it's like where

2157.48 --> 2164.079
the architecture really is

2160.78 --> 2167.619
where you can see design

2164.079 --> 2168.7000000000003
translated into patterns like a sub

2167.619 --> 2172.0
pattern

2168.7 --> 2173.7999999999997
six Dimension yeah

2172.0 --> 2175.96
been there a couple of times this is

2173.8 --> 2177.099
also where I saw the mechanism of the

2175.96 --> 2178.96
heavens

2177.099 --> 2181.7200000000003
this device

2178.96 --> 2184.5
that was placed on a stone pedestal like

2181.72 --> 2184.5
in a corner

2188.68 --> 2193.96
it's also where I had my really weird

2190.9 --> 2198.7000000000003
Atlas experience

2193.96 --> 2201.88
like and a council of Mages like people

2198.7 --> 2204.3999999999996
that were like trying to confront me

2201.88 --> 2205.839
with Pandora's Box and ask me what to do

2204.4 --> 2208.119
about it

2205.839 --> 2210.88
those types of experience were all the

2208.119 --> 2212.92
sixth Dimension very distinct very

2210.88 --> 2216.099
separate from regular Dark World

2212.92 --> 2220.859
Experience because I was different there

2216.099 --> 2220.8590000000004
I was only in one certain modus

2220.96 --> 2227.92
it's a different me very specific

2224.68 --> 2230.3199999999997
specific frequency very cleared up very

2227.92 --> 2234.839
unburdened

2230.32 --> 2234.839
by Earthly emotional burdens

2236.44 --> 2241.14
ah

2237.95 --> 2241.14
[Music]

2243.339 --> 2246.5789999999997
right so there's all these inner

2245.2 --> 2249.3999999999996
dimensions

2246.579 --> 2252.3390000000004
and then we can interconnect the

2249.4 --> 2254.92
potential for telepathy

2252.339 --> 2257.2
dude

2254.92 --> 2262.119
like I don't know why anybody would be

2257.2 --> 2264.7
like oh I wish there was more like dude

2262.119 --> 2266.26
look what you got man look at what you

2264.7 --> 2269.02
could

2266.26 --> 2270.82
figure out with what you got

2269.02 --> 2273.579
it's unbelievable

2270.82 --> 2276.28
to me it's like overwhelming

2273.579 --> 2281.099
that's why I'm not like constantly eager

2276.28 --> 2281.099
to like oh I have to like do more

2282.76 --> 2287.7400000000002
all these I gotta experience all these

2285.52 --> 2289.96
new things I'm not super eager because I

2287.74 --> 2292.72
find them overwhelming

2289.96 --> 2294.579
I get like way too much data it makes me

2292.72 --> 2297.0989999999997
feel

2294.579 --> 2299.8590000000004
in a way like a little kid again

2297.099 --> 2301.9
but not in a good way the overwhelming

2299.859 --> 2304.42
part of it

2301.9 --> 2306.579
right so I really when I do something I

2304.42 --> 2309.46
have to really have like this plan and

2306.579 --> 2311.8
prepare myself mentally to actually do

2309.46 --> 2314.859
that and because otherwise if things

2311.8 --> 2317.5
just oh like suddenly knock at my door I

2314.859 --> 2319.66
get really flustered unexpected things

2317.5 --> 2322.119
happen I get really flustered it's also

2319.66 --> 2326.44
what happened during like the

2322.119 --> 2329.44
a 2019 Amsterdam conference

2326.44 --> 2331.2400000000002
guys just suddenly like had it got in my

2329.44 --> 2333.579
face like hey how would you like to come

2331.24 --> 2336.7
on the tour and I was like

2333.579 --> 2339.3390000000004
like totally crushed

2336.7 --> 2342.04
shocked

2339.339 --> 2344.74
and literally like got almost like a

2342.04 --> 2347.02
nervous breakdown from it because it was

2344.74 --> 2349.4799999999996
just very sudden

2347.02 --> 2353.56
and new things especially if they really

2349.48 --> 2357.099
want them very overwhelming that prepare

2353.56 --> 2360.82
a lot and the more it

2357.099 --> 2362.92
heavy it is the more I need to prepare

2360.82 --> 2365.4
mentally

2362.92 --> 2365.4
anyway

2367.66 --> 2372.06
new documentary Next Level right

2372.22 --> 2375.4199999999996
came out today okay

2383.56 --> 2389.339
it's way beyond our comprehension did

2385.9 --> 2389.339
speak for yourself Dr Dino

2390.04 --> 2394.7799999999997
it's not Way Beyond my comprehension

2392.2 --> 2398.2
what could be out there

2394.78 --> 2402.8390000000004
I mean I will be amazed by it probably

2398.2 --> 2402.839
but it's not beyond my comprehension

2403.3 --> 2407.98
can very much Envision what can

2406.3 --> 2411.3590000000004
potentially be out there as part of what

2407.98 --> 2411.359
I do here on the show

2441.16 --> 2446.27
hmm

2443.14 --> 2446.27
[Music]

2446.28 --> 2454.1400000000003
unboxing you saw or not no

2449.98 --> 2454.14
I I'm not [ __ ]

2456.88 --> 2460.56
I'll get to see it soon enough

2465.88 --> 2473.28
is it really good or is it just like

2469.18 --> 2473.2799999999997
kind of a summarization of things

2475.78 --> 2482.1400000000003
by the way I did see a trailer before so

2478.42 --> 2484.7400000000002
it seemed like a very summarizing

2482.14 --> 2484.74
movie

2489.94 --> 2494.92
for newbies right

2492.099 --> 2499.619
yeah well I'm not

2494.92 --> 2499.619
yeah not really for me now is it

2505.72 --> 2511.1189999999997
I mean dare I say I'm almost getting

2508.839 --> 2513.04
bored with the Flat Earth debates

2511.119 --> 2515.38
almost

2513.04 --> 2517.42
it's still fantastic to hang around I

2515.38 --> 2519.6400000000003
mean it's still the guys it's like the

2517.42 --> 2521.859
one of the few groups I've ever

2519.64 --> 2524.68
experienced in my life where there's

2521.859 --> 2526.96
actually this level

2524.68 --> 2528.7599999999998
that is kept High

2526.96 --> 2531.7
and that's

2528.76 --> 2534.579
I like that and

2531.7 --> 2536.98
at the same time it kind of helps me to

2534.579 --> 2540.54
actually let that go a bit because I'm

2536.98 --> 2540.54
usually the one trying to do that

2540.64 --> 2544.7799999999997
and then when other people's uphold the

2542.5 --> 2547.72
level then I can like be a little bit of

2544.78 --> 2550.599
a kid again and just give more

2547.72 --> 2554.68
Personal Expressions

2550.599 --> 2557.579
and they accept that

2554.68 --> 2557.5789999999997
I like it

2558.579 --> 2564.1800000000003
do you believe we've been contacted by

2561.339 --> 2564.18
other life now

2567.339 --> 2572.0789999999997
plenty of spirits going around

2570.52 --> 2574.66
to not

2572.079 --> 2575.8
life forms and they're not from outer

2574.66 --> 2578.0789999999997
space

2575.8 --> 2581.5
Dr Dino you should know better by now I

2578.079 --> 2583.48
already gave you a full-on explanation

2581.5 --> 2585.66
as to what could potentially be out

2583.48 --> 2585.66
there

2589.06 --> 2597.42
right if there's something contacting us

2592.96 --> 2597.42
it's within the same Realm

2598.06 --> 2603.7
either physically somewhere else in the

2600.579 --> 2606.28
realm or spirits in the in the nether

2603.7 --> 2610.1189999999997
realm right

2606.28 --> 2613.0600000000004
or in the dark world if you will

2610.119 --> 2616.0
if there's creatures like inseparated

2613.06 --> 2617.98
Realm segments that are not connected to

2616.0 --> 2620.2
the volume of our Realm

2617.98 --> 2622.96
then we would not be able to

2620.2 --> 2626.7999999999997
telepathically connect with them

2622.96 --> 2629.38
because that goes through matter

2626.8 --> 2632.5600000000004
very certain of it

2629.38 --> 2635.859
have to be in the same Realm

2632.56 --> 2638.5
to have like telepathic connection

2635.859 --> 2642.46
it's very sci-fi like statement of mine

2638.5 --> 2644.079
but yeah I'm very certain about that

2642.46 --> 2646.96
if there even is such a thing as

2644.079 --> 2649.119
separated realm segments if there would

2646.96 --> 2651.18
be then I'm very certain you could not

2649.119 --> 2655.079
have telepathic connection

2651.18 --> 2658.4199999999996
across separated realm segments

2655.079 --> 2660.7000000000003
or any sort of material communication

2658.42 --> 2664.9
right because there's literally

2660.7 --> 2667.359
nothing in between not space that's void

2664.9 --> 2669.52
there's just no nothing

2667.359 --> 2672.88
it's not connected

2669.52 --> 2675.22
like even like after that point when

2672.88 --> 2677.859
it's not connected distance becomes

2675.22 --> 2679.48
irrelevant could be infinitely large it

2677.859 --> 2683.56
could be infinitely small the point is

2679.48 --> 2687.119
it's not connected there's no way to

2683.56 --> 2687.119
communicate to connect

2688.66 --> 2694.0789999999997
because connection goes through matter

2694.66 --> 2698.859
and even Spirit connection goes through

2697.54 --> 2700.54
matter

2698.859 --> 2703.74
through the Dark World still through

2700.54 --> 2703.74
matter yeah

2724.839 --> 2730.119
is that your belief now that's that

2727.48 --> 2732.46
physical fact Dr Dinah there is no outer

2730.119 --> 2736.2400000000002
space vacuum

2732.46 --> 2739.66
there is no infinite or seemingly

2736.24 --> 2741.9399999999996
infinite large volume that surrounds a

2739.66 --> 2744.16
supposed ball Earth

2741.94 --> 2746.14
and where we have gas pressure at ground

2744.16 --> 2749.319
level and then

2746.14 --> 2751.06
it transitions into endless amount of

2749.319 --> 2753.16
volume of void

2751.06 --> 2756.18
yeah that that doesn't exist it's

2753.16 --> 2756.18
physically impossible

2765.819 --> 2772.2
has nothing to do with belief

2768.52 --> 2772.2
it's physically impossible

2772.839 --> 2777.64
you could never demonstrate anything

2774.76 --> 2780.5200000000004
like that on a small scale

2777.64 --> 2783.4
right you can have gradation

2780.52 --> 2785.619
within a set volume due to temperature

2783.4 --> 2788.56
influence

2785.619 --> 2790.7200000000003
but yeah even no matter how aggravated

2788.56 --> 2794.38
that temperature influence is

2790.72 --> 2796.5989999999997
Never Gonna cause gas to kind of Heap up

2794.38 --> 2800.2000000000003
on one side

2796.599 --> 2802.599
and then quickly

2800.2 --> 2806.98
like become lower pressure and then have

2802.599 --> 2808.3590000000004
a very large majority of void vacuum on

2806.98 --> 2811.78
the other side

2808.359 --> 2815.619
that is physically impossible to create

2811.78 --> 2820.2400000000002
under any circumstance yeah because it

2815.619 --> 2822.1600000000003
it is basically it opposes natural law

2820.24 --> 2828.0
doesn't work like that gradient's always

2822.16 --> 2828.0
going to be linear it mostly linear

2828.22 --> 2834.66
might be a little bit like this

2831.04 --> 2834.66
right that's it

2835.24 --> 2839.859
that's how a gradient is going to be

2836.98 --> 2840.48
it's never going to be like

2839.859 --> 2842.38
um

2840.48 --> 2844.859
[Music]

2842.38 --> 2844.859

2853.119 --> 2858.42
look at me making finger graphs in the

air

2864.16 --> 2867.1189999999997
I need a wider screen

2876.4 --> 2881.52
we live in a snow globe then no

2884.02 --> 2889.9
but we live in a contained system though

2887.38 --> 2892.9
there is a limited amount of volume in

2889.9 --> 2894.94
order for well the gas pressure gradient

2892.9 --> 2896.26
as we experience to even be able to

2894.94 --> 2898.359
manifest

2896.26 --> 2901.7400000000002
in that pattern

2898.359 --> 2901.74
there's a limited volume

2907.42 --> 2913.6800000000003
definitely not

2909.339 --> 2913.68
an astronomical sized volume

2916.48 --> 2923.099
and it doesn't surround the Earth

2919.9 --> 2923.099
from all sides

2938.8 --> 2941.3390000000004
okay

2948.72 --> 2953.859
Timothy Jordan outer space was created

2951.339 --> 2957.339
the high Jesus well that's a bit of a

2953.859 --> 2960.7
stretch but yeah indirectly

2957.339 --> 2962.2
outer space was created to

2960.7 --> 2964.0
make

2962.2 --> 2967.4199999999996
man

2964.0 --> 2968.98
and Earth insignificant

2967.42 --> 2973.7400000000002
right

2968.98 --> 2973.7400000000002
which is the opposite of what Jesus did

[ __ ]

3010.14 --> 3016.7
this channel is Comedy gold wow you're

3013.5 --> 3016.7
so entertained I guess

3018.66 --> 3022.5789999999997
you got any questions

3023.48 --> 3028.8
dbldv or whatever the [ __ ] that's

3026.28 --> 3031.02
supposed to mean

3028.8 --> 3034.7000000000003
are you just a 12 year old kid that's

3031.02 --> 3034.7
just like oh is this

3035.579 --> 3043.319
which I'm fine with like I would do that

3040.02 --> 3046.02
but yeah even as a 12 year old kid I

3043.319 --> 3048.2
would freaking ask questions a lot of

3046.02 --> 3048.2
that

3051.48 --> 3055.8
I would just start to ask questions

3053.339 --> 3058.14
upping the ladder until the person would

3055.8 --> 3060.119
just be like scared

3058.14 --> 3061.859
and then I'd stop I know like okay this

3060.119 --> 3064.619
is how much they can handle

3061.859 --> 3067.2799999999997
it's a lot less subtle like that when I

3064.619 --> 3067.28
was 12.

3085.319 --> 3088.04
foreign

3095.54 --> 3101.4
I learned Flat Earth good and you

3099.66 --> 3104.8799999999997
I learned it a couple of times

3101.4 --> 3107.7000000000003
throughout my life but it never stuck

3104.88 --> 3110.76
because there were basically people

3107.7 --> 3112.3799999999997
very around me

3110.76 --> 3116.1600000000003
that would

3112.38 --> 3118.559
like become very hostile

3116.16 --> 3121.0789999999997
so is basically

3118.559 --> 3123.3
without even realizing it too much peer

3121.079 --> 3125.579
pressured out of it a lot of the time

3123.3 --> 3127.6800000000003
like I just realized like yeah with

3125.579 --> 3130.1400000000003
everything that I do and the people that

3127.68 --> 3133.339
I hang around with I cannot

3130.14 --> 3133.339
get into this

hmm

3211.02 --> 3216.2599999999998
cool

3212.22 --> 3216.2599999999998
that's awesome there 306

3223.14 --> 3228.66
yeah well there look if we are raising

3226.68 --> 3231.96
up in all this

3228.66 --> 3233.8799999999997
we manifested what we did well then the

3231.96 --> 3236.76
newer there will be newer Generations

3233.88 --> 3239.1600000000003
that do it too and that will surpass us

3236.76 --> 3240.7200000000003
again

3239.16 --> 3244.14
because they're much more

3240.72 --> 3246.839
they basically came out in the Deep

3244.14 --> 3249.54
in yeah in the slide

3246.839 --> 3253.38
of it all in the Awakening itself so

3249.54 --> 3256.14
they might be brilliant very young

3253.38 --> 3257.819
oh let's hope they are able to maintain

3256.14 --> 3261.3799999999997
it right because if you manifest

3257.819 --> 3261.38
Brilliance you get attacked

3262.38 --> 3268.2200000000003
it will happen at some point

3264.66 --> 3268.22
it will be jealous people

3274.619 --> 3280.619
must be born genius

3277.559 --> 3283.52
right well that's what my mother used to

3280.619 --> 3283.52
say about me too

3284.579 --> 3292.2000000000003
I think that yeah people that are like

3288.96 --> 3294.7200000000003
like really smart like actually smart

3292.2 --> 3295.98
and have like this this Spirit also that

3294.72 --> 3297.839
protects it

3295.98 --> 3300.54
it's not just like mechanical

3297.839 --> 3303.66
intelligence and just an idiot an

3300.54 --> 3305.579
impulsive idiot on top of that

3303.66 --> 3308.0989999999997
that

3305.579 --> 3310.559
they are born like that

3308.099 --> 3312.1800000000003
and they're usually the younger they are

3310.559 --> 3315.059
the purer they are

3312.18 --> 3316.6189999999997
but also the more vulnerable in that so

3315.059 --> 3319.98
that yeah they have to have proper

know the word

3454.02 --> 3459.599
fossilization is a very natural process

3456.839 --> 3461.04
and can happen very rapidly

now

3461.04 --> 3466.5589999999997
it's the Beast system

3466.559 --> 3471.8390000000004
proves

Evolution like petrified animals and

3471.839 --> 3477.66
super far past that part and especially

they can be cute

3580.26 --> 3586.44
I mean I'm very certain that oil

3582.799 --> 3589.02
replenishes itself right oil

3586.44 --> 3591.02
so

3589.02 --> 3593.339
right do you have an oil well

3591.02 --> 3595.2
replenishes itself when it's depleted

3593.339 --> 3598.0789999999997
after a while

it like

3615.42 --> 3621.059
look

3616.5 --> 3623.54
it filled up with coal again what

3621.059 --> 3623.5400000000004
no

3624.42 --> 3631.02
but oil yes it's because it's very

3628.68 --> 3634.2
likely to be caused by bacteria it's

3631.02 --> 3635.64
abiotic bacteria created oil that under

pressure

3635.64 --> 3640.68
eat

3636.96 --> 3643.94
away at rocks and turn it into the oil

3705.599 --> 3711.2400000000002
of heliocentrism

3707.96 --> 3714.839
dinosaurs it's the next step they

3711.24 --> 3718.6189999999997
planted it they like Bankers were giving

huge

3723.119 --> 3728.6400000000003
it's like the biggest creative burst

3725.7 --> 3729.96
that was ever probably done in those

3728.64 --> 3732.72
times

3729.96 --> 3735.119
a lot of people were just like building

that [ __ ]

3735.119 --> 3739.799
people were getting very creative you

3737.579 --> 3741.9
had to keep it a secret don't talk about

3739.799 --> 3744.299
how you faked it

3741.9 --> 3746.6600000000003
because then the money investment would

3744.299 --> 3746.66
be lost

3746.7 --> 3752.7599999999998
like rich people were just kind of using

3749.76 --> 3755.7000000000003
it all to be entertained by it

3752.76 --> 3757.6800000000003
to like have a delusion

3755.7 --> 3759.4199999999996
overcome them

3757.68 --> 3762.8999999999996
and then be entertained by it and like

3759.42 --> 3767.64
oh well Superior Evolution and oh let's

3762.9 --> 3770.839
go to a dinosaur convention and see

3767.64 --> 3775.98
what they dug up this time oh

3770.839 --> 3778.859
magnificent example right it's just like

3775.98 --> 3781.44
stupid Nouveau riche entertainment

3778.859 --> 3783.42
that's how they put it in there that's

3781.44 --> 3785.16
how they got the money and and then it

3783.42 --> 3788.46
became kind of standardized and

3785.16 --> 3791.7799999999997
integrated and education that's how the

3788.46 --> 3791.78
dinosaur thing happened

3798.299 --> 3801.92
okay David Berry what

3811.559 --> 3817.619
don't you mean first you read this no no

3814.38 --> 3822.96
they were planted

3817.619 --> 3828.319
not ReDiscover Dr Dino plant it people

3822.96 --> 3828.319
made props in workshops

3828.48 --> 3835.799
then went to dig sites

3833.16 --> 3840.0789999999997
placed the [ __ ] there

3835.799 --> 3840.079
then the archaeologist

3840.119 --> 3844.98
like they would maybe cover it up but

3843.119 --> 3847.98
usually they wouldn't just they just

3844.98 --> 3849.599
placed it like a an exposition they put

3847.98 --> 3852.799
it in the ground

3849.599 --> 3855.42
put it there then the archaeologist

3852.799 --> 3858.5389999999998
starts making photographs of the

3855.42 --> 3860.28
uncovered supposed uncovered [ __ ] get

3858.539 --> 3862.6800000000003
the newspaper

3860.28 --> 3865.5
get their investment

3862.68 --> 3868.02
and then they would dig it up again and

3865.5 --> 3870.059
put it together in some Museum that's

3868.02 --> 3873.68
what they did they placed it they

3870.059 --> 3873.6800000000003
literally made props

3874.079 --> 3879.299
put it in the ground then call the

3876.66 --> 3882.72
newspaper that's what they did it was

3879.299 --> 3886.5
all fake no exception all of it was fake

3882.72 --> 3889.8799999999997
it was all man-made in workshops

3886.5 --> 3889.88
every part of it

3891.78 --> 3897.0
and yeah and it could also be used for

3894.299 --> 3900.0
land grabs because it was like oh we're

3897.0 --> 3903.48
gonna build This Magnificent noob

3900.0 --> 3906.0
whatever Factory for this great product

3903.48 --> 3908.099
and then rubber Barons would be like

3906.0 --> 3911.94
we don't like that that competes with us

3908.099 --> 3914.1600000000003
oh oh archaeologists oh look oh on your

3911.94 --> 3916.02
side oh there's a bone literally they

3914.16 --> 3919.44
would make props

3916.02 --> 3922.079
get people to sneak in on work sites at

3919.44 --> 3925.92
night maybe bribe some guards and [ __ ]

3922.079 --> 3927.299
Place some prop bones there then the

3925.92 --> 3930.2400000000002
next day

3927.299 --> 3931.859
a shell that part of it is part of this

3930.24 --> 3933.5989999999997
fly they would be like oh we found

3931.859 --> 3936.48
something special archeology would come

3933.599 --> 3938.6400000000003
in like oh this is this is a an

3936.48 --> 3940.98
archeology site you can you have to stop

3938.64 --> 3944.0389999999998
the works right now we have to dig this

3940.98 --> 3947.88
up and they could like delay [ __ ] for

3944.039 --> 3950.4
months or years yeah and completely ruin

3947.88 --> 3953.039
the entire project

3950.4 --> 3956.88
yeah that's what they did too

3953.039 --> 3961.28
they were not shy of abusing that system

3956.88 --> 3961.28
to literally route out competition

3963.04 --> 3967.22
[Music]

3965.039 --> 3967.2200000000003
foreign

3969.76 --> 3976.15
[Music]

3984.38 --> 3990.7200000000003
don't think they were planted there I

3987.299 --> 3993.74
know they were planted Dr Dino it was an

3990.72 --> 3993.74
entire industry

3994.94 --> 4000.38
workshops yeah

3998.46 --> 4003.859
casting

4000.38 --> 4006.94
grinding up chicken bones

4003.859 --> 4006.94
putting it together

4007.819 --> 4013.7599999999998
plaster molds

4010.039 --> 4016.94
build fake skeletons and use parts of

4013.76 --> 4020.42
real skeletons like whale

4016.94 --> 4022.64
skeleton parts and whatever there was

4020.42 --> 4024.559
available horses like big they wanted

4022.64 --> 4027.14
big right so they were just looking out

4024.559 --> 4029.2400000000002
for real big bones and then they kind of

4027.14 --> 4032.0589999999997
just made the rest of chicken bones

4029.24 --> 4033.9799999999996
glued together chicken bones

4032.059 --> 4036.7400000000002
that's what they did

4033.98 --> 4037.7
there's like the molds are even like on

4036.74 --> 4040.2799999999997
record

4037.7 --> 4042.799
officially they literally made that

4040.28 --> 4044.599
official and people just didn't get it

4042.799 --> 4047.18
and then later they made a cover story

4044.599 --> 4049.6400000000003
for it like yeah we can't actually show

4047.18 --> 4052.2799999999997
you the real bones because it's

4049.64 --> 4055.339
dangerous radioactive [ __ ] whatever

4052.28 --> 4056.3590000000004
so they keep the supposed real [ __ ] in a

4055.339 --> 4058.2799999999997
box

4056.359 --> 4062.72
and they had to make

4058.28 --> 4065.2400000000002
fake ones for display and that's what

4062.72 --> 4067.0989999999997
the casts are for so they make this fake

4065.24 --> 4068.839
one and then they say oh look we got the

4067.099 --> 4070.52
real stuff but you can't see it it's

4068.839 --> 4074.119
dangerous

4070.52 --> 4075.92
to pay for it gets special permission to

4074.119 --> 4078.559
deal with it maybe like even get a

4075.92 --> 4080.78
certain degree in something

4078.559 --> 4084.5
getting on the club in order to even

4080.78 --> 4088.1600000000003
handle that yeah that's how they do it

4084.5 --> 4090.5
it's all a giant scam

4088.16 --> 4092.66
gigantic

4090.5 --> 4095.96
colossal

4092.66 --> 4101.5599999999995
feel free to ban you out

4095.96 --> 4101.56
bad me please I feel so humiliated

4101.6 --> 4105.1990000000005
now

4103.159 --> 4108.44
I don't know why it would ban you you

4105.199 --> 4112.0
just kind of dumb

4108.44 --> 4112.0
you're not threatening at all

4117.739 --> 4122.259
popped up tells gyroscopes God

4127.27 --> 4133.88
[Music]

4129.679 --> 4137.4800000000005
so now you know dinosaurs are fake

4133.88 --> 4140.719
had workshops to make skeletons

4137.48 --> 4143.959999999999
put it in the ground and then pick up

4140.719 --> 4145.779
huge amounts of cash to do that

4143.96 --> 4148.299
get

4145.779 --> 4151.279
conventions going

4148.299 --> 4153.98
museums going about it

4151.279 --> 4156.9800000000005
and that would be like a tourist

4153.98 --> 4158.9
attraction for the super rich that we're

4156.98 --> 4161.0599999999995
all into it because it was the latest

4158.9 --> 4163.4
rage it's the new thing

4161.06 --> 4167.179
right Evolution oh look here's the proof

4163.4 --> 4170.179
dinosaurs and they were very

4167.179 --> 4172.339
yeah they were glad to be fooled as long

4170.179 --> 4173.659
as they weren't publicly shamed or

4172.339 --> 4176.7789999999995
anything right

4173.659 --> 4178.8189999999995
they didn't care about reality only the

4176.779 --> 4181.219
only freaking thing they cared about was

4178.819 --> 4183.7390000000005
just public reputation they didn't care

4181.219 --> 4186.319
about freaking reality

4183.739 --> 4188.48
there were totally out of their mind

4186.319 --> 4191.900000000001
rich people

4188.48 --> 4194.12
they they lose track of reality it is

4191.9 --> 4197.48
what happens

4194.12 --> 4200.78
right it worked it was a scam it brought

4197.48 --> 4205.239
in huge amounts of money it worked and

4200.78 --> 4205.239
now it's like standardized in society

4210.32 --> 4217.9
oh my God stop whining

4213.38 --> 4217.900000000001
I'm addressing you and your name

4220.94 --> 4227.12

4224.48 --> 4228.379999999999
dinosaur bones conceal US History indeed

4227.12 --> 4230.9
they do

4228.38 --> 4233.4800000000005
because there is actual interesting

4230.9 --> 4236.599999999999
archery archeology that could be done

4233.48 --> 4239.839999999999
like dinosaur or not dinosaur

4236.6 --> 4242.4800000000005

people in America right it's on record

4242.48 --> 4246.5599999999995
that they've been found and every time

4244.4 --> 4250.04
the freaking Museum gets involved they

4246.56 --> 4252.4400000000005
destroy it literally on record like

4250.04 --> 4255.0199999999995
destroy it they destroy the evidence

4252.44 --> 4258.339999999999
people from the museum

4255.02 --> 4262.9400000000005
the Smithsonian Institute they destroy

4258.34 --> 4265.159000000001
the archaeological evidence on purpose

4262.94 --> 4268.5199999999995
yeah

4265.159 --> 4272.659
and then they plant their bull shitty

4268.52 --> 4274.76
Workshop made dinosaur skeletons

4272.659 --> 4277.179
and strike up a lot of money it's what

4274.76 --> 4277.179

foreign

4428.12 --> 4434.48
guys in chat can I have a vote

4432.02 --> 4437.3
whether I should ban this ass clown

4434.48 --> 4439.58

4437.3 --> 4442.34
complaining

4439.58 --> 4446.0199999999995
one if you want him banned zero if you

4442.34 --> 4446.02
wanna let him linger

4448.12 --> 4452.199
Democratic decision about it

4455.179 --> 4459.28
or say Ben that's fine

4461.0 --> 4463.84
foreign

4471.58 --> 4475.36
just trolling okay

4476.42 --> 4480.82
that's immediate man then

4496.58 --> 4500.96
unless he's with nobody Rick back he

4498.62 --> 4502.5199999999995
isn't that's the problem he was only

4500.96 --> 4505.34
complaining

4502.52 --> 4508.06
and then he's even got the god to say

4505.34 --> 4508.06
like oh

4508.88 --> 4515.02
you still believe in the flat earth like

4511.28 --> 4515.0199999999995
dude shut the [ __ ] up

4515.12 --> 4519.04
get

4516.5 --> 4519.04
out

4519.26 --> 4526.52
get a point just get the [ __ ] out

4523.699 --> 4529.28
like I'm willing to sit through your

4526.52 --> 4533.56
terrible mood or behavior or whatever if

4529.28 --> 4533.5599999999995
you actually have a point you see

4536.719 --> 4539.44
ah

4539.719 --> 4543.7390000000005
once it's heartbroken by showing him

4541.94 --> 4546.799999999999
Flat Earth

4543.739 --> 4550.299999999999
well yeah it's in the title

4546.8 --> 4550.3
he knows it's here

4550.82 --> 4557.86
yet they come here to do that

4554.96 --> 4557.86
what's the point

4559.219 --> 4565.34
like why are you following me then

4562.76 --> 4567.14
if you can't stand Flat Earth or

4565.34 --> 4569.0
whatever I do

4567.14 --> 4572.4800000000005
why

4569.0 --> 4574.58
why would you be watching me in order to

4572.48 --> 4578.178999999999
get triggered about that I mean is

4574.58 --> 4581.719
getting triggered about something

4578.179 --> 4583.9400000000005
is that like a worthwhile endeavor

4581.719 --> 4587.0
to you or something like is that does

4583.94 --> 4590.0599999999995
that have value getting triggered like

4587.0 --> 4592.94
what why why do you do that

4590.06 --> 4594.4400000000005
what's the point

4592.94 --> 4596.299999999999
why don't you go do something more

4594.44 --> 4598.94
productive with your life if you just

4596.3 --> 4601.900000000001
here to get triggered

4598.94 --> 4601.9
I don't get it

4605.239 --> 4609.259999999999
by making him realize it's real well

4607.34 --> 4612.02
yeah they do that in every opportunity

4609.26 --> 4614.719
right but they have to be willing you

4612.02 --> 4615.9800000000005
can't make somebody want

4614.719 --> 4617.4800000000005
to learn

4615.98 --> 4620.36
you see

4617.48 --> 4623.54
they have to want it

4620.36 --> 4626.48
that might brace against it right that's

4623.54 --> 4628.58
natural I expect that I expect like

4626.48 --> 4630.98
Ballers to get in here and be like oh

4628.58 --> 4633.8
this stupid Flat Earth

4630.98 --> 4636.139999999999
I mean this is wrong that's wrong I

4633.8 --> 4638.659000000001
expect that because then they're dealing

4636.14 --> 4641.3
with the pain bracing against it but

4638.659 --> 4643.879999999999
they're still inquiring they're still

4641.3 --> 4645.4400000000005
actually looking at the model and

4643.88 --> 4648.1990000000005
thinking about it and getting feelings

4645.44 --> 4650.299999999999
right you can play with that you can

4648.199 --> 4651.919999999999
actually then engage and then just tell

4650.3 --> 4653.4800000000005
them a couple of things and see if

4651.92 --> 4655.34
they're letting it in

4653.48 --> 4656.78
they're actually evolving they're trying

4655.34 --> 4659.719
to thinking

4656.78 --> 4664.239
right of course they're going to start

4659.719 --> 4667.1
out bracing against it it's very scary

4664.239 --> 4668.659
they don't like it they don't like

4667.1 --> 4671.120000000001
thinking about but they want to know

4668.659 --> 4673.58
right it's natural that they'll have

4671.12 --> 4675.679
some like uh annoying arrogance or

4673.58 --> 4677.659
scoffing at flat earthers

4675.679 --> 4681.14
that's fine

4677.659 --> 4685.099999999999
if they then actually inquire if they're

4681.14 --> 4687.860000000001
only here just like Oh I'm a badass I'm

4685.1 --> 4691.04
the badass I'm gonna sit in class and

4687.86 --> 4694.88
act like oh I don't care oh I'm so cool

4691.04 --> 4698.0
oh I don't need to know that that's just

4694.88 --> 4700.76
[ __ ] that's a waste of time you're

4698.0 --> 4703.1
not doing anything here you're just

4700.76 --> 4705.8
wasting people's time

4703.1 --> 4707.96
those are like the asses

4705.8 --> 4709.46
that some of you might remember in

4707.96 --> 4711.9800000000005
school days

4709.46 --> 4714.32
that were just like wasting everybody's

4711.98 --> 4718.599999999999
time and then ended up

4714.32 --> 4718.599999999999
being a poor [ __ ]

4718.64 --> 4722.659000000001
that doesn't do anything and nobody

4720.38 --> 4724.159000000001
likes them they have no life and then

4722.659 --> 4725.48
they start to hang around with like

4724.159 --> 4728.54
trash

4725.48 --> 4729.86
that's those people

4728.54 --> 4732.44
yeah

4729.86 --> 4733.82
you can have a bit of lip you can have a

4732.44 --> 4738.62
bit of attitude

4733.82 --> 4740.78
but only if you actually want to know

4738.62 --> 4742.699
if you still want to improve if you're

4740.78 --> 4745.599999999999
just there to be a dick

4742.699 --> 4745.599999999999
then get out

4756.32 --> 4760.239
and good luck with your cheese and wine

4775.28 --> 4782.139999999999
yeah psych where I know it's deranged

4778.1 --> 4782.14
and like what are they accomplishing

4783.8 --> 4791.14
and like how

4786.8 --> 4791.14
how can they waste their time like this

4794.54 --> 4799.64
is it just like escapism they just like

4797.659 --> 4801.739
they just don't want to feel terrible

4799.64 --> 4803.96
about doing absolutely nothing and

4801.739 --> 4805.28
wasting their own time

4803.96 --> 4808.58
so they just

4805.28 --> 4811.219
go here be a troll and then they feel up

4808.58 --> 4812.96
this fake temporary feeling that they're

4811.219 --> 4815.56
actually worth something I don't know

4812.96 --> 4815.56
what it is

4815.84 --> 4823.54
but I never get like an actual feeling

4819.679 --> 4823.54
of accomplishment from any of them

4828.32 --> 4835.699
it's mostly just tragic

4830.71 --> 4835.699
[Music]

4836.78 --> 4841.88
right

4838.46 --> 4843.38
just trust me you really do trust me on

4841.88 --> 4845.54
this if

4843.38 --> 4848.6
if you're a passionate person and you're

4845.54 --> 4851.9
like I hate this I hate that I get it

4848.6 --> 4854.7390000000005
dude I hate a lot of freaking things

4851.9 --> 4858.259999999999
it's quite disruptive

4854.739 --> 4860.54
to myself because I walk around and it's

4858.26 --> 4862.820000000001
like oh I love this and then something

4860.54 --> 4865.159
happens like I hate that and then I was

4862.82 --> 4868.0599999999995
like oh then let it go let it go okay

4865.159 --> 4872.299999999999
let's do it again right it

4868.06 --> 4874.34
I get that it's very tough it's tough I

4872.3 --> 4876.679
have

4874.34 --> 4880.6990000000005
like

4876.679 --> 4881.9
yeah Commodities I have ways of dealing

4880.699 --> 4885.379999999999
with that

4881.9 --> 4886.879999999999
so I get it passionate maybe out of

4885.38 --> 4889.219
control a bit

4886.88 --> 4890.84
there's a need for that right it's it's

4889.219 --> 4892.34
the energy and you don't know really

4890.84 --> 4895.04
what to do with it so it expresses

4892.34 --> 4898.6990000000005
itself like that or I'm here

4895.04 --> 4901.94
I can help you to basically turn that

4898.699 --> 4904.4
like rebellious

4901.94 --> 4908.299999999999
feeling and sensation into like

4904.4 --> 4912.86
connected with actually having a grip

4908.3 --> 4917.4400000000005
on what frustrates you to fix it

4912.86 --> 4917.44
but you gotta allow that to happen

4917.9 --> 4923.839999999999
and you gotta want to understand things

4920.96 --> 4925.88
you gotta want to understand what's

4923.84 --> 4929.139
bothering you

4925.88 --> 4929.139
and make the effort

4958.659 --> 4963.5
that's right seeking star water globers

4961.219 --> 4964.88
think pointing and laughing at others

4963.5 --> 4966.139
makes them smart you know where they

4964.88 --> 4969.34
learned that

4966.139 --> 4969.34
in school

4970.94 --> 4973.0
um

4974.06 --> 4978.1990000000005
it's a bluff

4975.62 --> 4981.0199999999995
it's a bluff system

4978.199 --> 4983.9
a lot of people use that on me as I as

4981.02 --> 4986.540000000001
they were kids and I was

4983.9 --> 4989.179
and I was so freaking gullible I

4986.54 --> 4990.08
believed every single one of them every

4989.179 --> 4994.04
time

4990.08 --> 4997.04
I was a kid like no matter how weird

4994.04 --> 4999.86
Elias or a bluff that you told me I

4997.04 --> 5002.739
would believe it

4999.86 --> 5006.219
it's like I could like instantly create

5002.739 --> 5009.28
an entire cosmology just to

5006.219 --> 5010.3
to continuate the belief in whatever was

5009.28 --> 5012.94
said

5010.3 --> 5015.54
I worked like it was very weird in a way

5012.94 --> 5015.54
crazy

5016.84 --> 5020.860000000001
but

5018.34 --> 5023.860000000001
yeah when you grow up you start to see

5020.86 --> 5026.199
things for what they really are

5023.86 --> 5029.38
and then it doesn't work anymore but

5026.199 --> 5032.138999999999
there's still these people later in life

5029.38 --> 5033.76
they keep holding on to that

5032.139 --> 5036.96
they can think that they can just like

5033.76 --> 5039.6990000000005
in school just like you're so stupid

5036.96 --> 5042.58
point at the flat earther and the class

5039.699 --> 5044.86
laughs with the teacher that looks very

5042.58 --> 5048.239
disapproving and then they feel like yes

5044.86 --> 5048.239
we're on the smart side

5048.88 --> 5053.5
yeah

5050.62 --> 5056.5
that doesn't work

5053.5 --> 5058.42
it doesn't work anymore

5056.5 --> 5060.58
and if it would work then you're

5058.42 --> 5062.92
surrounded by numpties

5060.58 --> 5064.48
and that numptiness is constantly going

5062.92 --> 5068.46
to be rubbing off so you're already

5064.48 --> 5068.459999999999
pretty much an empty at that point

5068.86 --> 5074.5
you're just stuck in the delusion where

5071.08 --> 5076.9
you keep reenacting that school level of

5074.5 --> 5078.88
social hierarchy where you can just

5076.9 --> 5081.699
Bluff you're smarter and if you're with

5078.88 --> 5085.36
the big group then you win

5081.699 --> 5087.94
it's a reenactment it's a reenactment of

5085.36 --> 5090.88
that school social mechanic

5087.94 --> 5092.98
very certain and it is literally created

5090.88 --> 5095.5
invoked

5092.98 --> 5098.08
in the at the age where they start to

5095.5 --> 5100.54
showed globe in class

5098.08 --> 5103.12
the peer pressure effect is a part of

5100.54 --> 5106.12
that I went through that I still

5103.12 --> 5108.94
remember it this to this day

5106.12 --> 5110.5
I remember that moment

5108.94 --> 5112.239
like oh

5110.5 --> 5113.44
yeah we're going to talk about what the

5112.239 --> 5115.419999999999
Earth is

5113.44 --> 5116.678999999999
here's a picture of what they thought it

5115.42 --> 5119.56
used to be

5116.679 --> 5123.159
a flat Earth in a snow globe and I'm

5119.56 --> 5126.400000000001
like oh whoa that's so epic what is that

5123.159 --> 5129.099999999999
you're like no bad they literally talk

5126.4 --> 5131.32
to me like a dog bat

5129.1 --> 5132.639
that's stupid

5131.32 --> 5136.599999999999
like

5132.639 --> 5139.4800000000005
but I just want to know what that is

5136.6 --> 5140.26
no you're not supposed to want to do

5139.48 --> 5142.178999999999
that

5140.26 --> 5145.360000000001
this is what the Earth really is is a

5142.179 --> 5148.0
glow I'm like yeah

5145.36 --> 5151.599999999999
I just wanted to know what that picture

5148.0 --> 5152.8
is that's all

5151.6 --> 5154.780000000001
right

5152.8 --> 5156.9400000000005
but there was just this peer pressure

5154.78 --> 5159.88
thing that they enacted and everybody

5156.94 --> 5163.299999999999
just fell in line

5159.88 --> 5167.28
and I was at a pretty young age like

5163.3 --> 5167.28
is it seven or something

5168.58 --> 5171.78
I still remember that

5172.179 --> 5180.639
it creates that school level

5176.62 --> 5183.58
social hierarchy effect and people to

5180.639 --> 5186.52
this day still some of them hang on to

5183.58 --> 5190.42
that like it still works and they bound

5186.52 --> 5193.900000000001
together to basically reenact to

5190.42 --> 5196.36
themselves that school level way of

5193.9 --> 5199.36
going about where if you're

5196.36 --> 5201.88
with the narrative you win

5199.36 --> 5204.339999999999
it's not just like with Ballers against

5201.88 --> 5206.62
flat earthers by the way the the whole

5204.34 --> 5208.06
bunch of categories of groups of people

5206.62 --> 5210.34
that do that

5208.06 --> 5211.84
sometimes very small sometimes it's

5210.34 --> 5215.1990000000005
pretty wide

5211.84 --> 5218.38
but people do that they reenact

5215.199 --> 5222.04
a little Club to reenact like it used to

5218.38 --> 5224.1990000000005
be not adult smart Dynamic way of going

5222.04 --> 5228.639
about being very honest with yourself

5224.199 --> 5231.5199999999995
being cordial right no no no reenact the

5228.639 --> 5233.86
old school days of social going about if

5231.52 --> 5236.860000000001
you're with the group

5233.86 --> 5239.9
you win

5236.86 --> 5243.07
people do that

5239.9 --> 5243.07
[Music]

5249.88 --> 5255.52
right and it is ego driven it is

5252.52 --> 5257.620000000001
absolutely ego driven it's but you know

5255.52 --> 5260.4400000000005
that's the social

5257.62 --> 5261.94
hierarchy and social behavior is

5260.44 --> 5264.58
basically

5261.94 --> 5266.44
a lot of it is directly involving the

5264.58 --> 5269.38
ego

5266.44 --> 5270.638999999999
like what position your ego wants to

5269.38 --> 5275.28
take

5270.639 --> 5275.28
our fuel feels forced to take

5275.32 --> 5278.98
right all those things it is involved

5277.719 --> 5280.96
with the ego it doesn't make it

5278.98 --> 5283.659
automatically bad

5280.96 --> 5286.78
but it is yeah if people have ego

5283.659 --> 5288.82
problems then they will

5286.78 --> 5291.34
start yeah they will start to reenact

5288.82 --> 5293.82
the old days when that just seemed fine

5291.34 --> 5293.82
to do

5298.6 --> 5303.42
they don't grow out of it

5300.82 --> 5303.42
anyway

5311.679 --> 5316.659
the elite play high school magic yeah

5314.199 --> 5318.46
they do in a way

5316.659 --> 5321.9
that's right

5318.46 --> 5321.9
David Berry good one

5338.32 --> 5344.159
you can dazzle with your Brilliance

5340.719 --> 5344.159
baffle with bullshits

5353.199 --> 5356.46
my ego

5358.6 --> 5361.1990000000005
all right

5362.62 --> 5366.5199999999995
I mean

5364.06 --> 5368.56
that's the weird thing right

5366.52 --> 5371.26
the ego

5368.56 --> 5374.219
is just another fragment of your spirit

5371.26 --> 5374.219
in ways

5374.5 --> 5378.4
and you can do all kinds of things with

5376.9 --> 5380.98
your ego

5378.4 --> 5384.58
I mean I have a pretty Dynamic relation

5380.98 --> 5386.199
with my own ego my ego is very strong

5384.58 --> 5388.36
you know why

5386.199 --> 5389.32
because I've been through things that

5388.36 --> 5392.32
were

5389.32 --> 5395.699
where I literally took risk

5392.32 --> 5395.699
for my own sanity

5397.0 --> 5403.179
to basically

5399.699 --> 5406.599999999999
get a grip on

5403.179 --> 5409.0
very Niche frequencies

5406.6 --> 5410.860000000001
and the Darkness

5409.0 --> 5414.82
took risk for that

5410.86 --> 5417.5199999999995
that forced my ego to basically get a

5414.82 --> 5421.32
boost it forced it and it is

5417.52 --> 5421.320000000001
like I have to deal with it

5421.6 --> 5428.56
it's a punishment

5423.52 --> 5430.06
effectively but I can use that

5428.56 --> 5434.9800000000005
I use it

5430.06 --> 5436.900000000001
to maintain Insight on what it is to be

5434.98 --> 5439.86
consumed by vengeance

5436.9 --> 5439.86
for example

5440.38 --> 5444.6990000000005
without losing the principles because

5442.54 --> 5447.34
that is the primary goal of all things

5444.699 --> 5449.62
with whatever I'm doing is to maintain

5447.34 --> 5451.0
as much natural

5449.62 --> 5454.96
traits

5451.0 --> 5458.92
without letting them corrupt me

5454.96 --> 5461.44
you can only do that with an ego

5458.92 --> 5466.1990000000005
if you have very little ego

5461.44 --> 5466.199
then it's just not gonna happen

5472.6 --> 5477.639
right

5474.46 --> 5480.639
but if you get carried away by whatever

5477.639 --> 5483.76
you're gonna allow your ego to get

5480.639 --> 5485.679
then it will turn against you like the

5483.76 --> 5488.9800000000005
devil

5485.679 --> 5491.92
right you have to look up

5488.98 --> 5494.138999999999
The Devil in a cage

5491.92 --> 5496.2390000000005
you have to be dynamic about it if you

5494.139 --> 5499.78
just lock it up and just never look

5496.239 --> 5502.54
again then it will die and you will lose

5499.78 --> 5505.0
it you will lose the power but if you

5502.54 --> 5507.04
have a dynamic with it if you give it a

5505.0 --> 5508.36
place where it is allowed to come out

5507.04 --> 5512.699
for a few

5508.36 --> 5512.699
if you basically enslave it

5512.86 --> 5517.179
is all internal if you enslave it but

5516.219 --> 5520.9
still

5517.179 --> 5522.6990000000005
are like a generous reasonable slave

5520.9 --> 5525.159
owner this is trigger trigger trigger

5522.699 --> 5528.5199999999995
trigger right this is all internal

5525.159 --> 5532.239
then you can use it

5528.52 --> 5534.88
this is how I deal with Baldwin

5532.239 --> 5537.879999999999
he's in a golden cage

5534.88 --> 5540.2390000000005
has all kinds of power and megalomania

5537.88 --> 5540.2390000000005
even

5540.34 --> 5544.96
but he does not have control over me I

5543.28 --> 5548.4
am not addicted

5544.96 --> 5548.4
to that state of mind

5553.36 --> 5558.179
that's just the ego playing with itself

5562.12 --> 5567.719
that's right seeking star water when you

5564.04 --> 5567.719
tame the line it becomes an ally

5568.96 --> 5573.42
make great effort to do that

5573.94 --> 5579.4
because I took a whole bunch of [ __ ] on

5576.88 --> 5583.84
my shoulders as I was young that at

5579.4 --> 5583.839999999999
first just seemed like corruption

5584.5 --> 5588.78
but because of my focus and the

5586.659 --> 5591.58
principles and Never Letting Go really

5588.78 --> 5594.58
Underneath It All

5591.58 --> 5598.84
I've been able to transform it all and

5594.58 --> 5598.84
just turn it into utility

5599.139 --> 5606.639
I turned the punishment into utility

5603.46 --> 5609.46
but it can only work if you honor if you

5606.639 --> 5612.219
have honor right you can't fake that you

5609.46 --> 5615.28
can't take punishment and then like I'm

5612.219 --> 5617.44
going to from like a evil controlling

5615.28 --> 5619.54
mindset like I want to rule the world I

5617.44 --> 5620.919999999999
have no respect for anything you can't

5619.54 --> 5623.56
fake it

5620.92 --> 5625.719
it can only work

5623.56 --> 5628.320000000001
if you're like with God if you're

5625.719 --> 5631.62
truthful if you're not consumed by a

5628.32 --> 5631.62
demonic will

5631.659 --> 5637.08
it can only work if you actually let

5634.6 --> 5637.08
that go

5640.42 --> 5645.659
it's it's the reward for Redemption

5675.219 --> 5680.679
yeah you cannot fake Redemption it is a

5678.4 --> 5683.44
transformation and

5680.679 --> 5686.1990000000005
if you're lying about it then it doesn't

5683.44 --> 5688.54
work it doesn't happen

5686.199 --> 5691.299999999999
you're just Faking It

5688.54 --> 5692.86
more lies

5691.3 --> 5695.02
you're not gonna go through a

5692.86 --> 5697.599999999999
transformation until the lies are all

5695.02 --> 5700.0
washed off you've until you've come

5697.6 --> 5702.52
clean until you

5700.0 --> 5704.34
redeem

5702.52 --> 5707.38
and then

5704.34 --> 5710.5
if you have the talent and the will and

5707.38 --> 5713.8
the principles then you can turn the

5710.5 --> 5714.88
punishment into a utility that you can

5713.8 --> 5718.6
build on

5714.88 --> 5721.5
and like help others with understanding

5718.6 --> 5721.5
and all that

5745.719 --> 5750.2390000000005
anyways turning out to be a pretty good

5747.699 --> 5750.239
show today

5777.58 --> 5781.08
I got a title for today

5781.71 --> 5786.54
[Music]

5783.699 --> 5786.54
foreign

5789.36 --> 5798.58
[Music]

5795.54 --> 5800.38
punishment into utility through

5798.58 --> 5803.5199999999995
Redemption

5800.38 --> 5803.52
it's a great title

5816.699 --> 5821.32
two

5818.08 --> 5825.1
David what are you talking about

5821.32 --> 5827.58
what's this freaking hashtag [ __ ]

5825.1 --> 5827.58
what

5842.35 --> 5845.4890000000005
[Music]

5869.38 --> 5873.84
hello hello hello hello hello

5874.48 --> 5880.419999999999
is anybody out there

5877.42 --> 5882.82
you're getting hypnotized turning inward

5880.42 --> 5885.1
with your thinking cross-referencing

5882.82 --> 5887.58
everything I've said to a whole bunch of

5885.1 --> 5887.58
memories

5891.76 --> 5895.08
my style yeah I agree

5896.32 --> 5901.78
and it's like a formula on its own

5899.32 --> 5904.42
it's basically a formula that directly

5901.78 --> 5906.82
expresses

5904.42 --> 5909.58
like a wider tactic that I've used

5906.82 --> 5912.4
throughout my entire life

5909.58 --> 5914.58
because I have been I I like to be a

5912.4 --> 5916.138999999999
naughty boy

5914.58 --> 5918.5199999999995
naturally

5916.139 --> 5921.159000000001
I had that from my mother

5918.52 --> 5923.76
it's very annoying by the way

5921.159 --> 5923.759999999999
I know

5924.159 --> 5928.599999999999
what

5925.719 --> 5931.6
should I then extinguish

5928.6 --> 5933.1
that impulse of being naughty

5931.6 --> 5937.2390000000005
or

5933.1 --> 5938.92
can I actually use it right

5937.239 --> 5940.659
there's all kinds of way you can use

5938.92 --> 5943.119
that impulse

5940.659 --> 5946.799999999999
can use it for comedy

5943.119 --> 5946.799999999999
you can use it for

5950.02 --> 5953.280000000001
counter propaganda

5954.58 --> 5958.44
like not being affected

5960.159 --> 5965.339999999999
by like Imperial lies or mind control

5969.34 --> 5973.84
right so it starts out with punishment

5971.86 --> 5976.78
of course when you're naughty you get

5973.84 --> 5979.119000000001
punished well if you can then learn from

5976.78 --> 5980.259999999999
every of those experiences of through

5979.119 --> 5984.219
the punishment

5980.26 --> 5988.0
you learn a lot yeah somebody that's a

5984.219 --> 5991.78
naughty boy throughout their youth

5988.0 --> 5994.659
they end up on average learning a lot

5991.78 --> 5996.099999999999
more practical things about life and

5994.659 --> 5999.82
about people

5996.1 --> 6002.6
then Goody Two-Shoes

5999.82 --> 6002.599999999999
uh-huh

6003.239 --> 6008.759999999999
because the Goody Two-Shoes never

6006.54 --> 6011.04
they suppressed it or extinguished The

6008.76 --> 6013.92
Naughty Boy spirit so they're always

6011.04 --> 6016.5
good but then they never really learn

6013.92 --> 6018.2390000000005
too much

6016.5 --> 6021.78
about it

6018.239 --> 6024.919999999999
about that inner nature

6021.78 --> 6028.82
right goody two shoes are usually

6024.92 --> 6028.82
repulsed by Naughty Boys

6039.36 --> 6042.86
Rogan's up yeah thanks

6044.82 --> 6049.139
that title is the path for perpetual

6047.219 --> 6051.54
energy of your soul hey thank you that

6049.139 --> 6053.88
yeah I'm I'm pretty impressed by the

6051.54 --> 6058.159
title too but

6053.88 --> 6058.159000000001
yeah it's a good formula

6075.06 --> 6079.52
Naughty Boy versus goody two shoes

6084.119 --> 6089.219
where did the rogans it up thing Cube

6087.78 --> 6090.239
from

6089.219 --> 6095.1
what

6090.239 --> 6099.239
where it came from this uh Owen Benjamin

6095.1 --> 6103.7390000000005
it's part of his height Supremacy lore

6099.239 --> 6105.78
and Rogan is is well a thumb he's a

6103.739 --> 6108.0
human thumb because he's so incredibly

6105.78 --> 6111.719
tiny

6108.0 --> 6115.08
so that's why it's Rogan's up

6111.719 --> 6118.88
it's just to remind everybody that Joe

6115.08 --> 6118.88
Rogan is a human thumb

6119.46 --> 6121.699
foreign

6123.5 --> 6128.1
like underestimate it though like it's a

6126.36 --> 6129.9
pretty freaking strong thumb it could

6128.1 --> 6132.96
probably break my neck

6129.9 --> 6137.159
if he really wanted to

6132.96 --> 6141.5
but yeah he is a human thumb

6137.159 --> 6141.5
so you can thank Owen Benjamin for that

6145.02 --> 6151.38
right so now you can never yeah my I've

6148.08 --> 6153.179
nailed so you can never look at it at a

6151.38 --> 6155.219
thumb like this without seeing Joe

6153.179 --> 6156.9
Rogan's face on it

6155.219 --> 6158.699
see

6156.9 --> 6161.699
[Music]

6158.699 --> 6164.219
you can never unsee that I could

6161.699 --> 6168.5
literally draw a face on it

6164.219 --> 6168.5
he win the Thumb Wars oh you know it

6171.6 --> 6177.0
especially now that he's nicknamed the

6174.3 --> 6178.8
human thumb like he could never use he

6177.0 --> 6180.0
can never lose that Thumb Wars ever

6178.8 --> 6184.219
again

6180.0 --> 6184.219
that could literally cost him his soul

6206.219 --> 6211.46
um okay David Barry that's

6209.34 --> 6215.9400000000005
a little stretch but I get it yeah yeah

6211.46 --> 6218.159
nail thumb nail nailing Jesus yeah yeah

6215.94 --> 6219.54
I think Rogan would certainly like to

6218.159 --> 6221.94
see that

6219.54 --> 6224.1
in himself

6221.94 --> 6225.659
sort of I don't know I don't know really

6224.1 --> 6228.360000000001
what's going on in Rogan's head anymore

6225.659 --> 6230.159
I don't like the last time I've even

6228.36 --> 6233.46
watched any of his

6230.159 --> 6235.58
stuff just like with Alex Jones on it or

6233.46 --> 6235.58
something

6237.96 --> 6245.52
but yeah Joe Rogan seems in many ways

6241.32 --> 6248.58
kind of vacated to me like

6245.52 --> 6249.719
things don't really touch him anymore

6248.58 --> 6253.139
right

6249.719 --> 6255.719
it doesn't have like this response to

6253.139 --> 6259.82
things anymore it's like it's all

6255.719 --> 6259.82
erased or suppressed

6261.6 --> 6266.58
I think that Joe Rogan is a very

6263.699 --> 6269.58
seriously desensitized person

6266.58 --> 6273.6
when he still has faculties but he's

6269.58 --> 6276.44
just it doesn't really respond to things

6273.6 --> 6276.4400000000005
naturally

6277.29 --> 6281.3
[Music]

6279.119 --> 6281.299999999999
foreign

6288.98 --> 6294.299999999999
who cares

6291.17 --> 6294.3
[Music]

6295.92 --> 6301.32
I mean I'm never really gonna forgive

6299.639 --> 6302.52
him for certain things that he's done

6301.32 --> 6305.759999999999
right

6302.52 --> 6308.159000000001
to actually promote very severe

6305.76 --> 6311.900000000001
hallucinogenics

6308.159 --> 6311.9
even to children

6312.36 --> 6317.4
like

6313.679 --> 6320.52
that's to me that's like a violation of

6317.4 --> 6323.759999999999
like a sacred right

6320.52 --> 6326.3
because I take hallucinogenics very

6323.76 --> 6326.3
seriously

6328.38 --> 6334.400000000001
it's not something you should [ __ ]

6330.06 --> 6334.400000000001
around with especially at a young age

6334.56 --> 6342.02
and he's unrepented about it that's like

6337.619 --> 6342.0199999999995
in a way that's unforgivable to me

6342.3 --> 6348.900000000001
because it is going to wreck people

6346.98 --> 6352.699
mentally

6348.9 --> 6352.699
that's what's gonna end up happening

6359.69 --> 6364.5199999999995
[Music]

6375.179 --> 6381.119
I know David Berry I know it's there

6378.96 --> 6384.619
it's all the more reason why you

6381.119 --> 6384.619
shouldn't be [ __ ] around with it

6386.159 --> 6388.82
I mean

6388.86 --> 6394.099999999999
they can't really [ __ ] up people David

6391.619 --> 6394.099999999999
Barry

6395.94 --> 6399.599999999999
it's like if they're not properly guided

6398.04 --> 6403.46
it's like if they're doing it while

6399.6 --> 6403.46
they're not being serious

6403.82 --> 6410.639
it's like when you do DMT or something

6408.06 --> 6413.9400000000005
in that direction it gets to like a

6410.639 --> 6416.9400000000005
reversed will outer body like experience

6413.94 --> 6419.4
things don't work the same way

6416.94 --> 6421.739
right all the discovery oh it's so

6419.4 --> 6425.699
amazing yeah yeah but you also get like

6421.739 --> 6428.28
very serious in very serious trouble

6425.699 --> 6430.86
if you're not following

6428.28 --> 6432.54
very strong spiritual principles while

6430.86 --> 6435.9
you do it

6432.54 --> 6438.659
if you're not guided properly

6435.9 --> 6442.04
you could literally just like fall into

6438.659 --> 6446.46
the hands of devils that will rip

6442.04 --> 6449.82
abilities away from you or even like put

6446.46 --> 6452.699
curses on you that will act like Express

6449.82 --> 6455.639
themselves into like permanent medical

6452.699 --> 6459.199
issues you understand

6455.639 --> 6459.1990000000005
is very serious

6462.42 --> 6467.659
it's not to be taken lightly ever in my

6465.3 --> 6467.659000000001
opinion

6476.639 --> 6482.04
right and yeah even especially as a kid

6479.88 --> 6485.2390000000005
you might think that you'll have good

6482.04 --> 6487.92
principles yeah so did I

6485.239 --> 6490.259999999999
holy [ __ ] was I wrong about a whole

6487.92 --> 6493.08
bunch of them just go wrong and I just

6490.26 --> 6496.619000000001
at the time I Unleashed my fractal

6493.08 --> 6499.98
creative thinking to kind of try to make

6496.619 --> 6501.839999999999
sense of these things and weave them in

6499.98 --> 6504.86
yeah

6501.84 --> 6504.860000000001
I was wrong

6505.38 --> 6512.82
and I have faced situations in the dark

6508.38 --> 6515.1
world where that was a huge detriment

6512.82 --> 6517.799999999999
that I was wrong about these things I

6515.1 --> 6520.46
dwelled off into illusion and it's the

6517.8 --> 6522.719
miracle I got out of it

6520.46 --> 6528.02
relatively intact

6522.719 --> 6528.02
with only a few medical issues

6530.94 --> 6537.54
like for example I'm pretty decently

6534.0 --> 6540.36
sure that my jaw situation is a direct

6537.54 --> 6542.94
result of some of these things

6540.36 --> 6545.88
that I experienced

6542.94 --> 6549.0
like when I was 17.

6545.88 --> 6551.28
like before that it was never prominent

6549.0 --> 6554.88
it was reoccurring it was never after

6551.28 --> 6557.099
that like things really went bad

6554.88 --> 6559.32
for a while

6557.099 --> 6561.92
and it's kind of like it's worse now

6559.32 --> 6561.92
than it was

6562.44 --> 6568.86
I mean when before that

6565.619 --> 6571.5
it's just that happens you get to face

6568.86 --> 6576.0599999999995
things that are literally gonna tell you

6571.5 --> 6579.54
to like you want this pay a price like

6576.06 --> 6583.639
where what do you pay what if your body

6579.54 --> 6587.54
Integrity are you going to pay down pay

6583.639 --> 6587.54
for something to happen

6589.619 --> 6592.159
this

6592.26 --> 6598.04
is

6594.119 --> 6598.04
you you shouldn't

6598.32 --> 6603.659
open that up you shouldn't just like

6600.9 --> 6607.638999999999
open that up for the public for idiots

6603.659 --> 6607.638999999999
to wander in and do that

6609.3 --> 6612.38
it's dangerous

6613.86 --> 6618.0
it requires proper guidance and

6616.32 --> 6621.239
instruction

6618.0 --> 6625.4
and a certain level of mental Mentor

6621.239 --> 6625.4
maturity and emotional

6631.86 --> 6634.4
right

6650.34 --> 6653.78
right yeah LSD

6654.84 --> 6660.2390000000005
look the thing is

6657.179 --> 6665.719
there are things you can

6660.239 --> 6665.718999999999
do with it like LSD micro dosing

6666.06 --> 6670.38
right that people can do something with

6669.3 --> 6674.28
it

6670.38 --> 6678.54
has to be controlled it requires a sense

6674.28 --> 6680.88
of responsibility and mental maturity

6678.54 --> 6683.4
to do that

6680.88 --> 6685.88
like it should never be treated like a

6683.4 --> 6685.879999999999
party drug

6689.04 --> 6695.9
very food to what

6692.639 --> 6695.900000000001
the hell are you talking about

6696.119 --> 6703.699
am I free mason no

6700.5 --> 6703.699
not that I know of

6707.52 --> 6714.540000000001
I mean I might have like sort of

6710.28 --> 6717.739
connected up but like I'm solitary so

6714.54 --> 6720.659
what if I've actually been part of

6717.739 --> 6723.36
Freemasonry for some reason during like

6720.659 --> 6725.219
my wild times where I didn't was like

6723.36 --> 6727.58
connecting up to a whole bunch of crazy

6725.219 --> 6727.58
things

6728.659 --> 6735.719
then yeah I've probably been dislodged

6733.38 --> 6740.639
already very quickly

6735.719 --> 6743.52
because I was never gonna abide by rules

6740.639 --> 6750.54
like dictates of organizations I just

6743.52 --> 6752.52
like no no never not a single detail not

6750.54 --> 6754.38
a single detail

6752.52 --> 6756.659000000001
no church

6754.38 --> 6759.56
no Freemasons

6756.659 --> 6759.5599999999995
nothing

6760.32 --> 6767.0599999999995
but I will take your power thank you

6764.46 --> 6767.06
very much

6771.92 --> 6775.459
[Music]

6797.58 --> 6802.38
right

6799.739 --> 6805.5
so yeah

6802.38 --> 6810.719
you could think of me as a Freemason

6805.5 --> 6814.02
but if so I'm a free Freemason I'm

6810.719 --> 6816.0
actually unconnected but I think I get a

6814.02 --> 6818.159000000001
whole bunch of the Freemasons I

6816.0 --> 6821.599
understand what they're doing there

6818.159 --> 6821.598999999999
and I'm kind of like

6822.599 --> 6827.88
I still have some

6825.119 --> 6829.82
vision and ideas that they could be

6827.88 --> 6834.3
transformed into something better

6829.82 --> 6837.259999999999
instead of just being devil slaves

6834.3 --> 6837.26
a lot of them

6840.54 --> 6845.82
so I'm not a person that's like yeah all

6843.239 --> 6850.138999999999
the Freemasons have to be taken down and

6845.82 --> 6853.139
like no no no no no no give them a

6850.139 --> 6856.159000000001
chance to redeem themselves

6853.139 --> 6856.159000000001
and to actually

6856.88 --> 6863.159000000001
reconfigure how they're going to apply

6860.099 --> 6866.28
their abilities and talents

6863.159 --> 6869.098999999999
now to the detriment of humanity but for

6866.28 --> 6871.8
the embedterment on an individual level

6869.099 --> 6876.3
so not just freaking

6871.8 --> 6878.9400000000005
like Mass hoarding like hurting people

6876.3 --> 6881.76
with mind control right that's a factor

6878.94 --> 6883.739
with that they busy themselves with plan

6881.76 --> 6886.860000000001
that

6883.739 --> 6889.86
but yeah if that is the only thing then

6886.86 --> 6892.259999999999
they're basically just to covert mind

6889.86 --> 6895.08
control organization

6892.26 --> 6897.599
that should not be the only thing that

6895.08 --> 6900.36
they use their talents for it's a

6897.599 --> 6902.400000000001
terrible idea

6900.36 --> 6906.719
it's just gonna

6902.4 --> 6909.598999999999
like eventually unroute all the

6906.719 --> 6913.38
potential that they would have had

6909.599 --> 6916.9400000000005
to don't fixate so much on Darkness

6913.38 --> 6916.9400000000005
and control all the time

6939.48 --> 6946.58
Creator and create Taurus what

6943.44 --> 6946.58
what are you talking about

6961.5 --> 6964.219
what what

6974.52 --> 6980.3
are you talking about

6976.679 --> 6980.3
what does this have to do with anything

6996.599 --> 7003.58
oh dropo paint tank on the ball yeah I

7000.139 --> 7003.58
don't recommend you try that out

7021.199 --> 7025.5199999999995
if the Creator creators made the Moon

7023.179 --> 7029.08
and Sun just an optical illusion not

7025.52 --> 7029.080000000001
physical did the creator

7030.699 --> 7036.619
that did the creator that you mean do

7035.599 --> 7041.179
that

7036.619 --> 7043.5199999999995
to deliberately deceive us well who

7041.179 --> 7046.639
knows

7043.52 --> 7050.06
I mean that it is deceiving like it is

7046.639 --> 7052.88
suggestive in ways maybe God was like

7050.06 --> 7056.4800000000005
yeah oh you you want to understand it

7052.88 --> 7060.1990000000005
all well when I'm not gonna like

7056.48 --> 7063.879999999999
like give it all to you right

7060.199 --> 7063.879999999999
he made a challenge out of it

7064.94 --> 7070.699
that's how I see it and or maybe get a

7068.119 --> 7072.86
bit of like fiction idea of how it

7070.699 --> 7075.619
happened maybe it was originally really

7072.86 --> 7081.139
simple and then maybe

7075.619 --> 7085.4
the higher Mages in the spirit Realm

7081.139 --> 7087.56
were given like an opposition role and

7085.4 --> 7090.619
they modified it and they modified it

7087.56 --> 7092.780000000001
too deliberately make it confusing and

7090.619 --> 7095.179
suggestive mainly with the Moon

7092.78 --> 7097.219
to make it look like a rock

7095.179 --> 7099.32
that they could alter the original

7097.219 --> 7102.86
appearance

7099.32 --> 7105.739
like modifying a hologram so maybe

7102.86 --> 7108.46
it was later inserted to look like it

7105.739 --> 7108.459999999999
does right now

7108.739 --> 7113.959999999999
I don't know

7110.36 --> 7116.719
was it always exactly like this did the

7113.96 --> 7120.92
moon always exactly look like that

7116.719 --> 7123.8
it's not changing slowly right but it

7120.92 --> 7127.76
might have been modified at some point

7123.8 --> 7130.04
somehow to become looking like this

7127.76 --> 7132.820000000001
we don't know

7130.04 --> 7135.0199999999995
we don't know if it is the original

7132.82 --> 7139.42
hologram blueprint

7135.02 --> 7139.42
right I mean let's just say

7140.54 --> 7146.9
eternity civilization like

7143.96 --> 7150.619
Eternity for ancients Ancient Ancient

7146.9 --> 7152.78
high power High civilization

7150.619 --> 7154.58
who's to say that they didn't at some

7152.78 --> 7158.3
point just figure out through their

7154.58 --> 7159.92
energy mechanics how to like modify the

7158.3 --> 7161.96
skies

7159.92 --> 7165.26
like that they could literally just like

7161.96 --> 7167.32
we do this and then it's like the stars

7165.26 --> 7170.0
just start to light up super bright

7167.32 --> 7172.159
something right

7170.0 --> 7175.219
and maybe they were like yes

7172.159 --> 7177.0199999999995
we figured out a way to modify the

7175.219 --> 7179.4800000000005
appearance of the Moon

7177.02 --> 7181.400000000001
this is what the priesthood has decided

7179.48 --> 7183.739
that it's going to be looking like and

7181.4 --> 7184.94
these are the existential plans into the

7183.739 --> 7187.879999999999
future

7184.94 --> 7190.5199999999995
and they made it so mankind could have

7187.88 --> 7194.06
made it so at the high peak civilization

7190.52 --> 7196.280000000001
where they were able to somehow modify

7194.06 --> 7200.860000000001
the signature

7196.28 --> 7200.86
of the celestial light Holograms

7202.82 --> 7208.34
or it was simply always like that and

7205.28 --> 7210.259999999999
God was always just like making it like

7208.34 --> 7214.119000000001
that because oh you want to figure it

7210.26 --> 7214.119000000001
out okay let's make it complicated then

7214.88 --> 7220.76
because

7217.099 --> 7224.619000000001
yeah if it was all too straightforward

7220.76 --> 7224.619000000001
you might not be as interested

7225.8 --> 7231.76
and maybe not everybody should know

7228.08 --> 7231.76
everything like common knowledge

7233.719 --> 7236.679
could be either

7239.84 --> 7244.58
wow I can't believe there's already two

7241.94 --> 7248.5
hours past yeah

7244.58 --> 7248.5
so sure it was an intense show today

7266.42 --> 7274.9
no no borders boy don't encourage people

7269.719 --> 7274.9
to throw gas tanks on bonfires

7275.8 --> 7279.28
look at yourself

7302.36 --> 7308.48
why is David Berry asking what strange

7305.719 --> 7311.36
[ __ ] I don't know

7308.48 --> 7314.98
oh apparently because he's drinking Fat

7311.36 --> 7314.98
Cats dude what the [ __ ]

7315.679 --> 7321.619
why would you be drinking vodka at that

7319.04 --> 7325.9
time of the day that's sick

7321.619 --> 7325.9
David that's not good man

7327.08 --> 7332.42
don't do that that's like especially

7329.96 --> 7336.82
heavy alcohol in the morning is

7332.42 --> 7336.82
extremely bad for your brain

7351.02 --> 7355.280000000001
like don't

7353.54 --> 7357.619
and if you're even like if you're an

7355.28 --> 7358.94
alcoholic or whatever man I know it must

7357.619 --> 7361.339999999999
be very tough

7358.94 --> 7363.379999999999
drink something light at least in the

7361.34 --> 7365.96
mood don't drink heavy alcohol in the

7363.38 --> 7367.9400000000005
morning it's terrible

7365.96 --> 7369.8
if you do that and you keep that up

7367.94 --> 7372.919999999999
regularly

7369.8 --> 7374.900000000001
you're gonna have like serious physical

7372.92 --> 7376.159
damage from it you're gonna die from

7374.9 --> 7379.598999999999
that

7376.159 --> 7379.598999999999
seen it happen to people

7381.8 --> 7387.38
I may be your balance okay well your

7384.56 --> 7390.5
balance is telling you don't drink heavy

7387.38 --> 7391.46
alcohol in the morning don't ever do

7390.5 --> 7394.4
that

7391.46 --> 7397.04
start something light like

7394.4 --> 7399.92
like a

7397.04 --> 7402.38
like what I got I'll show you

7399.92 --> 7404.619
I'm gonna drink it on there but chill

7402.38 --> 7404.619
yeah

7427.099 --> 7429.28
okay

7429.44 --> 7433.82
all right

7431.78 --> 7437.0599999999995
drink this

7433.82 --> 7438.799999999999
don't drink vodka drink this

7437.06 --> 7441.8
it's called rattler

7438.8 --> 7444.38
it's basically half strong beer 2.2

7441.8 --> 7446.719
percent with lemon juice in it

7444.38 --> 7449.54
drink this in the morning

7446.719 --> 7451.28
not brain damage and you'll still get a

7449.54 --> 7454.4
bit of a buzz right because it's gonna

7451.28 --> 7457.34
be strong anyway in the morning after

7454.4 --> 7459.739
yeah it's all gotten out of your system

7457.34 --> 7463.659000000001
don't be an idiot

7459.739 --> 7463.659
yeah drinking water doesn't do it

7463.699 --> 7468.678999999999
no

7465.26 --> 7470.360000000001
don't drink strong alcohol in the

7468.679 --> 7473.119
morning ever

7470.36 --> 7474.92
if you're a drinker or an alcoholic

7473.119 --> 7476.96
don't do that

7474.92 --> 7478.579
it's gonna kill you

7476.96 --> 7480.92
yeah

7478.579 --> 7483.739
take something light like this it has

7480.92 --> 7485.4800000000005
orange juice in it which is good because

7483.739 --> 7487.78
you're going to need extra vitamin C

7485.48 --> 7487.78
anyway

7503.96 --> 7507.52
I hope you're listening to me

7510.86 --> 7515.239
yeah David is now yeah if you're gonna

7512.84 --> 7517.34
if you're gonna do that yet you're

7515.239 --> 7519.699
definitely an alcoholic even if you're

7517.34 --> 7523.34
an alcoholic you can still

7519.699 --> 7527.119
get a decent life with that

7523.34 --> 7528.92
don't drink strong alcohol in the

7527.119 --> 7531.5599999999995
morning

7528.92 --> 7532.52
don't do it don't start off with that

7531.56 --> 7535.76
ever

7532.52 --> 7538.400000000001
it's really really bad for you

7535.76 --> 7540.8
start out with something light

7538.4 --> 7544.598999999999
especially if it has orange juice in it

7540.8 --> 7544.599
there's this specific product

7545.84 --> 7548.619000000001
it's much better

7550.699 --> 7558.4
and that way yeah you'll give yourself

7553.04 --> 7558.4
like 10 or 20 years extra to live right

7560.179 --> 7566.06
because yeah dying from like liver

7562.579 --> 7567.98
cirrhosis or like brain damage that's

7566.06 --> 7571.219
really painful I've seen it happen to

7567.98 --> 7572.598999999999
people a good friend of mine uh like

7571.219 --> 7575.4800000000005
that's now

7572.599 --> 7578.599
15 years ago we both went to

7575.48 --> 7580.579
goldsmithing school his dad was an

7578.599 --> 7584.4800000000005
alcoholic like that

7580.579 --> 7587.42
and that guy was in terrible agony

7584.48 --> 7590.32
and a complete mental block right and he

7587.42 --> 7590.32
died like

7591.139 --> 7596.3
like a few years later then

7593.719 --> 7598.82
he literally drank himself to death

7596.3 --> 7601.159000000001
why because he was always drinking

7598.82 --> 7603.0199999999995
strong drinks

7601.159 --> 7605.239
especially very early in the morning

7603.02 --> 7606.9800000000005
then at some point he couldn't eat

7605.239 --> 7609.5599999999995
anymore

7606.98 --> 7611.598999999999
he would throw it up it just totally

7609.56 --> 7614.3
[ __ ] him up

7611.599 --> 7616.82
why because he had the strong drinks in

7614.3 --> 7618.26
the morning that kills you you

7616.82 --> 7622.54
understand

7618.26 --> 7622.54
it kills you don't do that

7639.739 --> 7645.459999999999
okay

7641.78 --> 7645.46
that guys get the [ __ ] out

7645.679 --> 7649.36

I gave you your advice take it

7653.239 --> 7656.379999999999
and [ __ ] off

7662.42 --> 7668.0
everyone's more beneficial than sure it

7664.88 --> 7673.179
is man on the edge but yeah if

7668.0 --> 7673.179
not people end up liking Alco more

7673.34 --> 7679.84
you can still live with it and not get

7676.88 --> 7679.84
yourself killed

7715.94 --> 7720.079
yeah if only you just shut his [ __ ]

7719.119 --> 7721.88

7842.3 --> 7846.860000000001
Arch note

7844.119 --> 7848.299999999999
unpleasant note around my around out my

7846.86 --> 7851.739
show with

7848.3 --> 7851.7390000000005
the rest was really great

7853.52 --> 7859.0
at least G

7856.04 --> 7859.0
you're late

7860.3 --> 7864.52
I was kind of about to round out the

7862.34 --> 7864.52
show

7879.92 --> 7886.639
I have to watch it back yeah indeed

7882.679 --> 7889.219
indeed you do it was a great show

7886.639 --> 7891.619
too bad you weren't there but I take it

7889.219 --> 7895.36
you were doing something worthwhile like

7891.619 --> 7895.36
taking care of your garden and all that

7895.639 --> 7899.679
and that's important right

7905.9 --> 7911.78
the whiskey could have been

7909.079 --> 7914.78
all right

7911.78 --> 7918.259999999999
all right that's funny

7914.78 --> 7920.5
since I just had this rant against the

7918.26 --> 7920.5
guy

7924.32 --> 7926.799999999999
yeah

7926.84 --> 7930.8
yeah I don't uh I don't touch anything

7929.659 --> 7935.0
like that

7930.8 --> 7937.099
like regular beer like like

7935.0 --> 7939.02
I like to start out with this especially

7937.099 --> 7941.2390000000005
like in spring and summer time because

7939.02 --> 7942.679
it's refreshing and it has lemon in it

7941.239 --> 7945.079
which is always good

7942.679 --> 7949.2390000000005
like to start out with that

7945.079 --> 7952.5199999999995
and then regular beer which is like

7949.239 --> 7956.839999999999
4.4 or four or five percent regular

7952.52 --> 7960.320000000001
alcohol strength beer and that's like

7956.84 --> 7963.1990000000005
no further I will not take anything

7960.32 --> 7966.079
stronger I refuse I literally refused

7963.199 --> 7968.299999999999
yeah I could I might even like the taste

7966.079 --> 7969.619
it's always going to feel shitty

7968.3 --> 7972.26
afterwards

7969.619 --> 7974.48
doesn't do anything good for me

7972.26 --> 7977.719
it never did anything good for me strong

7974.48 --> 7979.098999999999
like I could drink strong drinks when I

7977.719 --> 7981.619
was younger

7979.099 --> 7984.32
I've never had a single experience where

7981.619 --> 7985.46
I did that and it was the next day like

7984.32 --> 7989.36
yeah

7985.46 --> 7992.06
I gotta do that again sometimes never a

7989.36 --> 7993.679
single time had that experience

7992.06 --> 7996.9800000000005
with beer

7993.679 --> 7999.26
I have a lot of good experiences I don't

7996.98 --> 8002.86
really feel that bad the next day

7999.26 --> 8005.320000000001
and I know my limits I know how it works

8002.86 --> 8007.719
I know when I've had enough

8005.32 --> 8009.94
sometimes I push it a bit and then I'm

8007.719 --> 8012.099
like immediately it's proven to me again

8009.94 --> 8016.299999999999
like yeah yeah I my limits were exactly

8012.099 --> 8017.679
right I it should not try to push it but

8016.3 --> 8019.96
I have to test it you have to test

8017.679 --> 8022.9
what's real but I never try anything

8019.96 --> 8024.699
other than bear anymore I don't do it I

8022.9 --> 8027.28
don't even drink regular wine because

8024.699 --> 8028.36
it's like it does not feel good on my

8027.28 --> 8031.679
stomach

8028.36 --> 8031.679
bear feels great

8034.119 --> 8037.619
and of course marijuana

8038.739 --> 8045.239
and the combination I like the

8040.84 --> 8045.2390000000005
combination beer and cannabis

8046.119 --> 8048.598999999999
right

8048.88 --> 8055.42
and that way it's like both stronger and

8051.82 --> 8057.099
it all it like immediately slows down

8055.42 --> 8058.84
if you if you do both and don't

8057.099 --> 8061.119000000001
recommend anybody do this by the way

8058.84 --> 8063.46
some people react really badly to

8061.119 --> 8064.96
combining alcohol and cannabis so be

8063.46 --> 8067.179
careful

8064.96 --> 8069.76
for me however it's turned out to be

8067.179 --> 8072.82
like quite useful it's like it balances

8069.76 --> 8076.179
itself out you drink beer and I smoke

8072.82 --> 8078.5199999999995
marijuana and I drink less beer I drink

8076.179 --> 8081.52
slower because of the marijuana

8078.52 --> 8082.540000000001
I smoke less of the marijuana because in

8081.52 --> 8086.619000000001
beer

8082.54 --> 8087.76
and then that way I get less of both yet

8086.619 --> 8090.28
still

8087.76 --> 8093.639
and enjoying myself

8090.28 --> 8095.5
but that might not be working for the

8093.639 --> 8099.2390000000005
majority of people it might not have

8095.5 --> 8099.239
that effect so be careful with that

8099.4 --> 8103.5599999999995
but it's worked out for me fine

8116.199 --> 8122.379999999999
St dad passed away a few weeks oh [ __ ]

8120.52 --> 8124.719
cleaning out his apartment found all

8122.38 --> 8126.9400000000005
about oh right right

8124.719 --> 8130.54
yeah of course LSG well that's that's

8126.94 --> 8133.598999999999
like a a special occasion

8130.54 --> 8136.96
if it's in memory of somebody yeah that

8133.599 --> 8138.099
especially if you're with other people

8136.96 --> 8140.199
yeah

8138.099 --> 8142.3
that's that's different then it's like

8140.199 --> 8144.699
part of a ritual of just the family

8142.3 --> 8147.179
ritual

8144.699 --> 8147.178999999999
right

8148.3 --> 8154.3
I mean if I was in a situation like that

8151.42 --> 8157.599
then I would probably also

8154.3 --> 8159.46
like yeah take a drink of that

8157.599 --> 8162.78
because I'm with other people and then I

8159.46 --> 8162.78
also wouldn't drink too much

8163.84 --> 8168.82
unless I was like really emotional I

8166.719 --> 8172.54
mean

8168.82 --> 8175.0599999999995
in the time when my mom died

8172.54 --> 8177.28
we had those types of moments where we

8175.06 --> 8179.56
would drink and then I would actually

8177.28 --> 8180.4
drink too much because I was kind of

8179.56 --> 8182.320000000001
like

8180.4 --> 8183.219
I don't know what the hell to do with my

8182.32 --> 8185.38
life

8183.219 --> 8187.179
and then I'd like try to forget it so I

8185.38 --> 8189.88
kept like chugging and then yeah

8187.179 --> 8191.679
eventually feel sick but it the problem

8189.88 --> 8194.019
was mostly that I just didn't know what

8191.679 --> 8196.479
the hell to do with all that with the

8194.019 --> 8198.460000000001
situation and the energies and it had

8196.479 --> 8200.74
despair

8198.46 --> 8204.24
like help everything is crumbling around

8200.74 --> 8204.24
me I don't know what to do

8204.28 --> 8206.76
anyway

8208.3 --> 8212.259999999998
you consider not buying pot and beer and

8210.76 --> 8214.54
saving that money

8212.26 --> 8217.24
uh

8214.54 --> 8219.599
yeah I considered that not for very long

8217.24 --> 8219.599
though

8220.059 --> 8227.5
but I'm always considering like how can

8223.3 --> 8230.5
I minimize my expenditures on that

8227.5 --> 8233.16
right so my beer expenditures are really

8230.5 --> 8233.16
not that big

8234.46 --> 8239.438999999998
and yeah cannabis

8237.28 --> 8241.719000000001
it has ups and downs there's times when

8239.439 --> 8243.7
it really just starts to pull me in and

8241.719 --> 8245.858999999999
I smoke more and then there's times

8243.7 --> 8247.899000000001
where I'm like okay I need to take it

8245.859 --> 8250.78
easy and then I smoke very little

8247.899 --> 8254.819
it goes up and down

8250.78 --> 8254.819000000001
all together it is doable

8263.92 --> 8270.34
right but yeah

8267.099 --> 8274.66
I use both of it I use

8270.34 --> 8276.58
cannabis and I use beer I use beer

8274.66 --> 8278.139
to basically break down a couple of

8276.58 --> 8280.12
barriers of mine

8278.139 --> 8282.399
so I can engage something without

8280.12 --> 8284.92
constantly getting slapped in the face

8282.399 --> 8287.979
about how it's wrong about things

8284.92 --> 8292.12
yeah that's why I drink beer

8287.979 --> 8294.639
use pot because it really does pull me

8292.12 --> 8297.399000000001
into higher dimensional contact it makes

8294.639 --> 8298.719
it easier for me to use my spirit

8297.399 --> 8301.96
Dynamics

8298.719 --> 8304.178999999998
and to like tune into frequencies it

8301.96 --> 8306.759999999998
helps with that that's usually why I

8304.179 --> 8307.899
smoke a little bit of cannabis before I

8306.76 --> 8310.359
start the show

8307.899 --> 8311.319
sometimes it makes me really kind of

8310.359 --> 8313.179
slow

8311.319 --> 8316.3
at the start

8313.179 --> 8319.0
but that then goes away most of the

8316.3 --> 8320.619999999999
times it just helps me to get really

8319.0 --> 8322.479
tunneled in

8320.62 --> 8325.300000000001
into the subjects that I talk about

8322.479 --> 8327.938999999998
that's what the Cannabis does

8325.3 --> 8330.938999999998
I will still tunnel in naturally

8327.939 --> 8334.319
but the Cannabis like does definitely

8330.939 --> 8334.319
give me an extra push

8334.78 --> 8340.979000000001
and it makes me discover gems

8337.42 --> 8340.979
ideas conceptions

8343.0 --> 8347.2
don't you get worried you won't have

8345.04 --> 8349.899000000001
enough money for food yeah well if

8347.2 --> 8353.679
people don't donate to my show

8349.899 --> 8357.639
regularly yeah then I will get worried

8353.679 --> 8360.519
but it's not like oh I'm I have to buy

8357.639 --> 8363.339999999998
the drink and the Cannabis but I can't

8360.519 --> 8366.460000000001
buy food no

8363.34 --> 8369.819
if I'm running out of funding then I

8366.46 --> 8373.419999999998
also rolled I tighten up my drinks and

8369.819 --> 8373.42
my smokes naturally

8376.78 --> 8383.099
because of course eating is eventually

8379.66 --> 8383.099
the number one priority

8393.939 --> 8399.7
I call damages the brain so that you

8395.979 --> 8401.979
when you get old you forget who you are

8399.7 --> 8403.6
right well if that's the case then I'm

8401.979 --> 8405.76
already having that sort of damage

8403.6 --> 8407.800000000001
sometimes but

8405.76 --> 8410.14
but I've always had that so it's it's

8407.8 --> 8412.179999999998
probably not that

8410.14 --> 8414.279999999999
but I don't think that alcohol even

8412.18 --> 8418.12
damages the brain that much I think it's

8414.28 --> 8420.640000000001
being overplayed a lot I think that

8418.12 --> 8423.7
it's not good for the brain

8420.64 --> 8425.8
but if you have a good system and you're

8423.7 --> 8429.240000000002
filled with good nutrients and healthy

8425.8 --> 8432.22
eating and very little other poison

8429.24 --> 8434.26
biocumulative toxins and pesticides all

8432.22 --> 8436.599999999999
that crap if you don't have that in you

8434.26 --> 8439.359
then your system is actually quite

8436.6 --> 8442.0
capable of repairing that minor damage

8439.359 --> 8444.76
perfectly

8442.0 --> 8448.12
and that's how there's people that do

8444.76 --> 8451.359
drink even strong drinks that grow to be

8448.12 --> 8454.439
like 80 and they're fully sharp even at

8451.359 --> 8454.439
80. yeah

8456.46 --> 8460.858999999999
they are

8458.14 --> 8460.858999999999
so

8461.08 --> 8465.58
I think alcohol damages the brain is a

8463.359 --> 8468.1
bit of an over generalization

8465.58 --> 8469.96
I mean if you eat shitty you don't eat

8468.1 --> 8472.12
well

8469.96 --> 8474.699999999999
and you drink strong drink on top of

8472.12 --> 8477.28
that or maybe do other drugs too yeah

8474.7 --> 8479.740000000002
then it's gonna [ __ ] you up

8477.28 --> 8482.979000000001
because you don't have the the juices

8479.74 --> 8484.78
the the good stuff to regenerate

8482.979 --> 8487.479
yourself after it

8484.78 --> 8489.640000000001
you need that

8487.479 --> 8491.92
you need to be able to regenerate if you

8489.64 --> 8493.96
don't have the right nutritions and you

8491.92 --> 8495.819
drink strong yeah you're gonna freaking

8493.96 --> 8499.119999999999
break yourself down it's literally gonna

8495.819 --> 8500.199999999999
eat you up from the inside

8499.12 --> 8503.08
right

8500.2 --> 8507.16
so make sure you have a healthy diet and

8503.08 --> 8509.52
you accommodate for the alcohol

8507.16 --> 8511.66
maybe a little extra boost right like

8509.52 --> 8516.12
vitamin C

8511.66 --> 8516.119999999999
like some good orange juice the next day

8516.52 --> 8522.34
and make sure you eat like good fats

8520.06 --> 8524.199999999999
like these are all basic tips but

8522.34 --> 8526.479
they're critical like if you don't do

8524.2 --> 8529.859
that then it's actually going to start

8526.479 --> 8529.858999999999
wearing on you over time

8539.02 --> 8541.5
huh

8543.46 --> 8548.64
80 12 pack and Tequila all right

8549.88 --> 8553.74
sounds like he's having a good time

8554.62 --> 8557.28
Maybe

8557.68 --> 8562.68
yeah you can grow pretty old with it

8560.38 --> 8562.679999999998
right

8562.899 --> 8569.14
just be careful not to push it

8566.2 --> 8571.060000000001
like if it's like oh I want to oh

8569.14 --> 8573.34
sensation

8571.06 --> 8574.899
yeah then you're gonna push your body

8573.34 --> 8576.58
too far

8574.899 --> 8579.399
you're gonna need more and more and more

8576.58 --> 8582.34
and then it's going to break you up

8579.399 --> 8585.34
so find the right balance make sure

8582.34 --> 8588.28
you're taking enough nutrition

8585.34 --> 8592.439
to basically balance it out and then

8588.28 --> 8592.439
yeah don't overstep those boundaries

8593.439 --> 8597.66
anyway I'm rounding out the show

8598.479 --> 8603.938999999998
