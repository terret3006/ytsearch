colder although just now been a sun was

119.6 --> 123.67999999999999
C coming

120.799 --> 125.64

123.68 --> 129.56
very hazy up

125.64 --> 129.56
there weird hazy

129.959 --> 135.959
clouds some blue is very sparingly

141.08 --> 147.0
present very little wind too yeah by the

144.68 --> 148.76000000000002
way the mint plant has been exploding I

147.0 --> 153.08
think

148.76 --> 157.2
that I think it is like Inc increased in

153.08 --> 160.64000000000001
volume by like 50% since I potted it put

157.2 --> 163.35999999999999
it in there it's pretty incredible so

160.64 --> 165.95899999999997
many new leaves have

163.36 --> 167.59900000000002
sprouted like leaves new leaves in the

165.959 --> 170.599
armpits

167.599 --> 170.599
everywhere

170.959 --> 174.76
basically so that's pretty

175.159 --> 178.4
cool all

178.76 --> 181.76
right

186.4 --> 193.56
hello LSG first in chat teret 306

190.519 --> 199.799
Richard G good to see you

193.56 --> 199.799

206.44 --> 210.92
2023 how are you all

208.68 --> 213.68
doing

210.92 --> 216.83999999999997
oh man it was a bit of a late night last

213.68 --> 218.959
night because just Owen started live

216.84 --> 220.04
streaming which is weird on Saturday but

218.959 --> 225.799
like at

220.04 --> 225.79899999999998
a just terrible hour way too

231.079 --> 237.56
late but it was an interesting

234.84 --> 242.48
stream I'm watching like the second half

237.56 --> 242.48
of it right before I started the

258.68 --> 265.759
show okay

261.919 --> 265.75899999999996
terret I don't who is

268.6 --> 271.6
that

280.88 --> 283.8
right

288.199 --> 294.639
okay like is he like a Indian politician

292.0 --> 296.759
or something ter it I'm not entirely

294.639 --> 301.56
sure who you're talking about I mean I

296.759 --> 301.56
could Google his name but

305.88 --> 310.08
oh why SN

312.32 --> 318.479
that is that all I think is that like

315.759 --> 322.84000000000003
the brown guy that Republicans pushed

318.479 --> 322.84
forward that's like the the Shiva

325.44 --> 328.44
clone

328.479 --> 331.479
[ __ ]

331.6 --> 334.6
by

343.919 --> 348.96
right

345.96 --> 348.96
Noami

349.36 --> 356.24
right yeah that

351.88 --> 356.24
guy yeah he's

357.72 --> 362.40000000000003
terrible it's all plastered over infow

360.68 --> 364.96
Wars now to in

362.4 --> 367.56
advertisement it's like it is like

364.96 --> 369.68
shiva's totally I I didn't even actually

367.56 --> 372.4
need to do any confirming research to

369.68 --> 375.24
know exact exactly

372.4 --> 378.15999999999997
because that started to stand out to me

375.24 --> 380.68
even before Dr Shiva mentioned it or

378.16 --> 382.28000000000003
before I first noticed Dr Shiva

380.68 --> 383.68
mentioning that it was like what the

382.28 --> 387.44
[ __ ] is

383.68 --> 389.639
this Indian guy doing pretending like he

387.44 --> 392.8
old Grassroots like it's [ __ ]

389.639 --> 395.08
embarrassing man in these ads like can

392.8 --> 397.96000000000004
hear in his voice that is just a [ __ ]

395.08 --> 400.28
chill it's just lying to

397.96 --> 405.15999999999997
you trying to tell you what you want to

400.28 --> 408.15999999999997
hear and not feeling into it

405.16 --> 408.16
terrible

408.88 --> 413.28
terrible total total

413.72 --> 417.12
actor hello

418.4 --> 421.4
speeder

422.08 --> 427.96
yeah Shiva calls him the brown noser I

425.199 --> 427.96000000000004
thought that was kind of

437.12 --> 440.12
funny

440.56 --> 447.639
what account got

443.36 --> 449.12
suspended for visiting his post really I

447.639 --> 451.319
didn't even know he was on Twitter by

449.12 --> 453.199
the way like I guess I'm not really

451.319 --> 456.72
going to check it out I don't really use

453.199 --> 456.72
Twitter to dive around too

456.879 --> 461.96000000000004
much I actually use it more to keep

459.56 --> 465.479
track of Dutch politics stuff which is

461.96 --> 468.56
like super tedious to me by the way I

465.479 --> 471.52
mean you think that we're dealing with

468.56 --> 475.599
gamas here on Flat

471.52 --> 480.24
Earth holy [ __ ] man like the

475.599 --> 482.08
politics like it's just terrible

480.24 --> 484.24
and it always was terrible it's just

482.08 --> 486.919
like the terribleness is like really

484.24 --> 486.919
coming out

490.919 --> 498.19899999999996
now all these parties here are just like

495.479 --> 500.75899999999996
the old guard like has fallen you could

498.199 --> 502.84000000000003
say or they resign and now there's all

500.759 --> 505.52000000000004
these new little parties that are coming

502.84 --> 508.11999999999995
forward like oh yeah we're going to like

505.52 --> 511.44
we're going to do it right and blah this

508.12 --> 513.5600000000001
and that and they all secretly have the

511.44 --> 516.719
same agendas as the party that just

513.56 --> 518.8389999999999
scattered all of them and it's like

516.719 --> 522.0
really in your face and everybody is

518.839 --> 524.8800000000001
like pointing fingers continuous like oh

522.0 --> 526.12
I'm here and everybody like ah this

524.88 --> 529.04
freaking

526.12 --> 531.839
establishment like we know that like

529.04 --> 534.0
immediately there's no research required

531.839 --> 535.9590000000001
we just know that immediately we were

534.0 --> 539.279
already

535.959 --> 541.079
researched it's pretty weird and

539.279 --> 543.56
interesting in that sense what's going

541.079 --> 543.56
on here in the

547.48 --> 554.6
Netherlands it's like this establishment

550.8 --> 554.5999999999999
like it's really

558.64 --> 564.079
failed

560.88 --> 565.8
so my Dark World Visions also actually

564.079 --> 568.12
support that at some point there would

565.8 --> 570.7199999999999
be sort of a change of the

568.12 --> 573.519
Guard

570.72 --> 574.519
but that they also would basically start

573.519 --> 578.279
to

574.519 --> 580.6
apply more changes in the other

578.279 --> 583.279
direction that actually everybody

580.6 --> 583.279
doesn't really

583.8 --> 590.519
want so that's the problem and it's like

588.36 --> 592.2
there is no other way out like there

590.519 --> 593.64
it's basically there is no way out

592.2 --> 597.279
really

593.64 --> 600.8389999999999
like ah I'll start start to sound black

597.279 --> 605.16
fill don't want that it's just that this

600.839 --> 607.0400000000001
political situation the machine like

605.16 --> 609.8389999999999
there is only the

607.04 --> 613.279
machine it's like nobody can take the

609.839 --> 616.0400000000001
Reigns unless they are the machine now

613.279 --> 621.12
what type of machine they are is another

616.04 --> 621.12
matter I think there's like two

621.68 --> 627.8
programs and these programs it's like a

624.76 --> 631.24
devil competing with a demon

627.8 --> 632.8389999999999
and that's basically a metaphor derived

631.24 --> 634.88
from Dungeons and Dragons in which

632.839 --> 638.7600000000001
that's literally

634.88 --> 641.76
happening hell against the abyss demons

638.76 --> 644.399
against devils and they literally are at

641.76 --> 647.48
war with one another right they call it

644.399 --> 649.0
the Eternal war and it's kind of like

647.48 --> 651.639
that with

649.0 --> 654.639
politics and there's like two two

651.639 --> 657.76
factions within them it really is but

654.639 --> 660.279
they're also corrupt as [ __ ] most of

657.76 --> 662.079
them it's like like they're two factions

660.279 --> 665.04
but they can also just become so

662.079 --> 668.04
corrupted that it's

665.04 --> 673.48
like it's like a a little be system

668.04 --> 677.279
within a be system like there are like

673.48 --> 681.76
factions conspiring together against the

677.279 --> 683.88
rest and that's like this the the actual

681.76 --> 685.279
top shelf Beast system that's like the

683.88 --> 689.399
terrible

685.279 --> 692.36
stuff is the conspiracy of both of

689.399 --> 696.36
opponents to get together and actually

692.36 --> 701.2
do a worse job than ever like that group

696.36 --> 704.6800000000001
tries to like upturn the very rules of

701.2 --> 707.1600000000001
reality and that's palpable like they

704.68 --> 710.8389999999999
actually try to completely derail

707.16 --> 710.8389999999999
reality itself in people's

711.399 --> 714.8
heads the

714.92 --> 719.639
factions when just normally functioning

718.399 --> 721.68
as their

719.639 --> 725.36
component within the Beast system don't

721.68 --> 728.68
normally do that like that they try to

725.36 --> 732.04
abuse foreign knowledge of how people

728.68 --> 733.88
work and like use certain story formulas

732.04 --> 736.639
to get them to move in a certain

733.88 --> 740.48
direction right what they don't do is

736.639 --> 740.48
actually try to completely

741.32 --> 749.9590000000001
uproot reality like normal view of

745.6 --> 753.32
things and that's what this consp iring

749.959 --> 753.3199999999999
micr Beast system is

755.199 --> 759.519
doing so you could say that they're

757.56 --> 762.1199999999999
actually like a third party that's just

759.519 --> 763.88
Breaking All the Rules and that's also

762.12 --> 767.76
why they are failing but they are

763.88 --> 767.76
creating a lot of Chaos in the

770.92 --> 777.68
process which political party in the ne

774.639 --> 781.9590000000001
well I'm not really making a habit of

777.68 --> 786.12
voting but but I have had some interest

781.959 --> 788.3199999999999
in the forum for Democracy party but

786.12 --> 790.76
that's also just because the people in

788.32 --> 794.5600000000001
there

790.76 --> 797.3199999999999
just they're very pure they really do

794.56 --> 799.3599999999999
their best to be very very

797.32 --> 802.48
honest and they're

799.36 --> 805.76
very good at psycho and they they're

802.48 --> 808.12
very sharp at analyzing and figuring

805.76 --> 810.76
things out like they're actually good at

808.12 --> 810.76
it

811.76 --> 816.12
and and that is interesting

817.48 --> 823.12
that it gives me some hope somewhere

820.839 --> 825.32
because for me I guess that just having

823.12 --> 828.12
a high standard being upheld as an

825.32 --> 832.8000000000001
example is probably more important than

828.12 --> 832.8
whether somebody's even effectively

835.32 --> 839.639
ruling and they're not because nobody's

837.639 --> 842.519
giving them the Reign they are being

839.639 --> 845.04
like treated like Trump the whole party

842.519 --> 847.8
is they actually the other side is

845.04 --> 850.519
actually having the go to have public

847.8 --> 853.079
conversations and [ __ ] on how that party

850.519 --> 857.16
should be abolished because they're

853.079 --> 860.4799999999999
Nazis or something like the

857.16 --> 864.7199999999999
yeah it's a third party Beast system

860.48 --> 864.72
right total just destroy

867.68 --> 870.92
everything

869.48 --> 872.5600000000001
right you can't really call them the

870.92 --> 874.8389999999999
left because they're literally just

872.56 --> 879.4399999999999
creating war

874.839 --> 883.9590000000001
and they're doing both sides the third

879.44 --> 886.8800000000001
party does the the bad [ __ ] from both

883.959 --> 891.4399999999999
sides and

886.88 --> 893.759
more while they claim to be ending the

891.44 --> 895.0790000000001
old guards always right that's always

893.759 --> 897.639
their

895.079 --> 899.92
claim but what they do instead is take

897.639 --> 902.639
the worst aspect effect of the old

899.92 --> 906.36
guards and combine them for their own

902.639 --> 910.12
selfish purposes to to numb down and

906.36 --> 912.399
derail and Destroy people's minds more

910.12 --> 915.279
so their overall tactic is to literally

912.399 --> 917.72
Mesmerize everything into passivity that

915.279 --> 919.6
seems to be the primary tactic of the

917.72 --> 922.6800000000001
the third Beast

919.6 --> 924.6800000000001
party the the third

922.68 --> 927.5999999999999
faction that by the way the third

924.68 --> 930.6389999999999
faction is relatively

927.6 --> 933.44
new before that things were much more

930.639 --> 937.12
stable and the two factions were just

933.44 --> 940.44
doing their dance and it worked much

937.12 --> 943.68
better but with this third party in

940.44 --> 946.48
there the original dances are disrupted

943.68 --> 948.3599999999999
and people do also see now and study

946.48 --> 951.6800000000001
them more

948.36 --> 954.839
easily to elude their grip but at the

951.68 --> 957.319
same time the influencing Factor that's

954.839 --> 959.8800000000001
causing all that to happen is actually

957.319 --> 963.4399999999999
taking the power off of the old factions

959.88 --> 963.4399999999999
and abusing them even

964.0 --> 971.16
more hope this makes any kind of sense

967.279 --> 971.16
to you it's very

982.279 --> 988.72
esoteric right but for me I really do

985.48 --> 990.6
see also a form of democracy like the

988.72 --> 993.0790000000001
are in

990.6 --> 996.16
ways part of the be

993.079 --> 999.8
system they're just not part part of

996.16 --> 999.8
this third

1001.88 --> 1008.36
faction like because the third faction

1004.959 --> 1011.5189999999999
is like hyper Marxist and they literally

1008.36 --> 1014.519
just develop to destroy their own

1011.519 --> 1017.16
country the most likely outcome to be

1014.519 --> 1019.5600000000001
that Mega corporations that have no

1017.16 --> 1022.0
responsibility to rep people whatsoever

1019.56 --> 1024.8
literally buy everything up kind of like

1022.0 --> 1024.8
what they've tried in

1024.839 --> 1029.3999999999999
Maui and getting some serious push back

1027.64 --> 1033.959
by the

1029.4 --> 1036.88
way so that's kind of its design it's

1033.959 --> 1041.959
basically blow it all

1036.88 --> 1044.4
up and then a an autocratic zombie

1041.959 --> 1046.6000000000001
machine can just take it over that can

1044.4 --> 1049.4
treat people like Commodities because

1046.6 --> 1054.28
they have no responsibility toward

1049.4 --> 1054.2800000000002
them that is the third party Beast

1056.24 --> 1060.88
system maybe now that I've told you

1058.799 --> 1063.799
you'll be able to actually see that

1060.88 --> 1066.48
effect there's three parties it's not

1063.799 --> 1068.039
two parties there's three parties and

1066.48 --> 1072.88
the third

1068.039 --> 1075.679
party is part of both other parties they

1072.88 --> 1080.4
assimilate steal their powers and their

1075.679 --> 1080.4
conceptions and abuse them even more

1088.159 --> 1092.0390000000002
right anybody following

1094.559 --> 1101.6
me right but how do you know the third

1096.96 --> 1104.24
party system well because they will be

1101.6 --> 1107.9599999999998
rightwing but not behaving like

1104.24 --> 1110.159
right-wing or they will be leftwing but

1107.96 --> 1112.559
not behaving actually like left wing

1110.159 --> 1115.2
there will be well it's been happening

1112.559 --> 1118.2
for a while what do you call that

1115.2 --> 1118.2
liberal

1118.64 --> 1123.919
unaccountable self-appointed autocrats

1122.08 --> 1126.48
that think they know better than

1123.919 --> 1129.5200000000002
everybody but that's not left wing you

1126.48 --> 1131.64
see that's not really that original

1129.52 --> 1134.679
format

1131.64 --> 1139.76
of freedom to be who you want to be and

1134.679 --> 1141.799
no more war and right they're not that

1139.76 --> 1145.12
you can see

1141.799 --> 1148.72
that they're not

1145.12 --> 1152.7199999999998
actually that third they're not left

1148.72 --> 1152.72
wing they're the third

1156.0 --> 1161.88
party they'll take anything like they'll

1159.24 --> 1164.44
they'll go as far as to even go if it

1161.88 --> 1167.5590000000002
seemed like it like there was like it

1164.44 --> 1169.6000000000001
could be help them they would even act

1167.559 --> 1172.32
kind of like they right wi in certain

1169.6 --> 1174.799
moments just to score some apparent

1172.32 --> 1177.32
popularity points like that's how left

1174.799 --> 1177.32
they really

1177.44 --> 1185.8400000000001
are and because of that also well it's

1180.72 --> 1188.72
the derailing people lose track because

1185.84 --> 1191.32
a lot of people go on autopilot but if

1188.72 --> 1193.6000000000001
the ground destabilizes through which

1191.32 --> 1196.48
you are autop piloting well then you

1193.6 --> 1199.12
will literally just end up doing things

1196.48 --> 1201.559
not understanding why

1199.12 --> 1204.32
why

1201.559 --> 1206.48
literally and that's the effect effect

1204.32 --> 1207.52
of the third party of the third Beast

1206.48 --> 1210.72
system

1207.52 --> 1210.72
party that

1213.08 --> 1219.559
format hyper Marxist destructive

1216.6 --> 1222.76
literally trying to

1219.559 --> 1226.72
derail like spiritual logic and just

1222.76 --> 1229.919
like what is what completely undoing

1226.72 --> 1232.76
everything undoing like God's

1229.919 --> 1235.2800000000002
Logic that's what the third party does

1232.76 --> 1235.28
it's not

1238.36 --> 1244.4399999999998
leftwing right and when the rightwing is

1241.76 --> 1247.039
going to actually be like more

1244.44 --> 1250.2
Progressive and more gay and more

1247.039 --> 1251.8799999999999
protective of minorities and more that

1250.2 --> 1253.76
well guess what they're not actually

1251.88 --> 1256.0
really

1253.76 --> 1260.12
right-wing they're

1256.0 --> 1260.12
leftwing pretending to be right

1262.28 --> 1268.84
rightwing because they look rightwing in

1266.44 --> 1271.1200000000001
comparison to the third Beast party

1268.84 --> 1271.12
which

1271.4 --> 1278.88
is it's so far out there anything looks

1275.159 --> 1278.88
right-wing compared to

1282.96 --> 1288.919
that right so I guess I'm not going to

1285.72 --> 1291.0
have any form of feedback you know fine

1288.919 --> 1293.64
rolling out A New Concept why would I

1291.0 --> 1295.799
expect anybody to have anything to say

1293.64 --> 1299.039
in response to that ever even after I

1295.799 --> 1299.039
asked that multiple

1301.13 --> 1308.0490000000002
[Music]

1313.36 --> 1318.6789999999999
times ah hey Richard

1315.799 --> 1321.0
G description what's going on Canada

1318.679 --> 1323.0
yeah it's not just Canada but Canada is

1321.0 --> 1326.559
very in your face with

1323.0 --> 1330.08
it but you get it right left wing is not

1326.559 --> 1333.1589999999999
left wing they're not acting like let's

1330.08 --> 1337.6399999999999
say how what you would see as left wing

1333.159 --> 1340.279
20 30 years ago makes no

1337.64 --> 1343.159
sense they're a third

1340.279 --> 1346.96
party they're not

1343.159 --> 1349.88
left they're out of their

1346.96 --> 1352.559
mind and they're two- faced they'll

1349.88 --> 1355.7990000000002
assimilate whatever they can it's like

1352.559 --> 1359.6789999999999
it's pure about mind control in the

1355.799 --> 1362.84
moment morality is completely cut out of

1359.679 --> 1366.6000000000001
the picture there is no rules there's no

1362.84 --> 1369.3999999999999
rules but power for them it's the Only

1366.6 --> 1371.9599999999998
Rule they have is power if it brings

1369.4 --> 1376.039
power you do it no matter the

1371.96 --> 1378.8400000000001
cost have no principles principles are

1376.039 --> 1381.64
like magic tricks for them that they can

1378.84 --> 1385.08
rearrange to maintain control to

1381.64 --> 1388.24
maintain power that's what they do and

1385.08 --> 1391.1589999999999
if it completely breaks apart well too

1388.24 --> 1393.039
bad it's like oh we're a bit embarrassed

1391.159 --> 1395.2
oh okay yeah we'll get back to that

1393.039 --> 1397.48
later oh look at what we now put

1395.2 --> 1401.0800000000002
together oh see it's sort of cohesive

1397.48 --> 1404.84
right we're sort of reliable again right

1401.08 --> 1409.8799999999999
right the third Beast party they're

1404.84 --> 1409.8799999999999
completely insane and power mad

1411.76 --> 1420.1589999999999
there is a group of people that are like

1416.84 --> 1424.48
actually possessed by Satan it would be

1420.159 --> 1427.7990000000002
those people because power is like the

1424.48 --> 1429.72
only factor that even is involved sort

1427.799 --> 1433.12
of with the their Consciousness it's

1429.72 --> 1435.84
like the only thing they care

1433.12 --> 1438.4399999999998
about I don't I can't imagine anything

1435.84 --> 1441.3999999999999
more close to Satan

1438.44 --> 1445.6000000000001
than such a spirit could

1441.4 --> 1448.72
you it might be there though let's not

1445.6 --> 1451.76
ask God for showing us something like

1448.72 --> 1455.679
that but I mean at this point I can't

1451.76 --> 1459.96
imagine anything closer to representing

1455.679 --> 1462.3600000000001
Satan in a person pure power

1459.96 --> 1465.76
hunger pure

1462.36 --> 1468.559
ruthlessness like no more sensibility no

1465.76 --> 1470.36
more sizing up of what is what it's only

1468.559 --> 1473.2
only thing that matters is control it's

1470.36 --> 1475.559
the only thing that matters Nothing Else

1473.2 --> 1478.2
Matters whether you go through Hell or

1475.559 --> 1480.0
Heaven it doesn't matter only that you

1478.2 --> 1483.52
end up with the

1480.0 --> 1483.52
control that's how they

1484.18 --> 1490.48
[Music]

1486.159 --> 1495.6000000000001
operate and if they get caught for being

1490.48 --> 1497.44
violent vies thieves and murderers like

1495.6 --> 1501.6789999999999
they'll just stand there embarrassed

1497.44 --> 1504.3990000000001
like oh oh oops like they don't care

1501.679 --> 1506.3600000000001
they don't even have fear about it

1504.399 --> 1508.2399999999998
really they might have fear in the back

1506.36 --> 1511.76
of their mind when they're alone but

1508.24 --> 1514.2
it's like they're just openly

1511.76 --> 1517.72
Psychopaths it's like that's that spirit

1514.2 --> 1521.8400000000001
it's like oh oops oops Yeah I got caught

1517.72 --> 1524.039
in a very criminal action yeah oh well

1521.84 --> 1524.039
you

1526.679 --> 1529.679
know

1535.24 --> 1542.24
politicians are seduced by the desire of

1539.24 --> 1544.52
power that depends steamy traveler it

1542.24 --> 1547.559
depends on how they got into politics if

1544.52 --> 1549.36
they got into politics with a specific

1547.559 --> 1552.12
eternal

1549.36 --> 1555.6399999999999
mission then that eternal

1552.12 --> 1557.32
mission deflects any power seduction

1555.64 --> 1560.48
they may attain because the power

1557.32 --> 1562.96
becomes secondary that's what the really

1560.48 --> 1569.0
spirited politicians do that's what

1562.96 --> 1571.52
these guys at fed fed form f

1569.0 --> 1575.039
f

1571.52 --> 1577.84
FD form for democracy that's what they

1575.039 --> 1579.48
seem like they're all very focused and

1577.84 --> 1581.4399999999998
like they have this Mission they have

1579.48 --> 1583.3990000000001
these methods that they are they're just

1581.44 --> 1585.2
do they're processing it like comp like

1583.399 --> 1588.0
living

1585.2 --> 1591.24
computers and that's how you you can

1588.0 --> 1593.36
feel that they're not playing with power

1591.24 --> 1596.2
they're not they don't care about it

1593.36 --> 1601.9599999999998
it's like they know it's just going to

1596.2 --> 1601.96
consume them and and make their mission

1602.039 --> 1606.1589999999999
impossible you can feel that about him

1604.559 --> 1608.279
they're just they're just doing the

1606.159 --> 1611.5200000000002
struggle they're just doing the fight

1608.279 --> 1615.039
the spiritual war that's

1611.52 --> 1618.559
it so if somebody is like seduced by

1615.039 --> 1622.799
that devil through politics

1618.559 --> 1622.799
they get the smell of the pure power

1623.039 --> 1628.559
hunger of which like the third part

1626.039 --> 1631.039
Beast system party is like the most

1628.559 --> 1633.8799999999999
prominent example of like fullon

1631.039 --> 1638.96
corruption to that

1633.88 --> 1638.96
power now I've lost my point

1642.36 --> 1648.6
uh if you have a mission when you enter

1645.279 --> 1651.039
it's like I'm here to achieve a certain

1648.6 --> 1653.4399999999998
goal and I'm going to keep focused on

1651.039 --> 1655.64
that goal no matter what happens if you

1653.44 --> 1657.48
have that in enter politics then you

1655.64 --> 1660.159
don't risk

1657.48 --> 1661.24
corruption because you're not there to

1660.159 --> 1664.44
settle

1661.24 --> 1666.919
down you're not there to gather party a

1664.44 --> 1669.559
power like currency you're there to

1666.919 --> 1671.679
achieve something

1669.559 --> 1675.799
specific and when

1671.679 --> 1678.3990000000001
you are set up like that internally then

1675.799 --> 1680.559
you can deflect power corruption because

1678.399 --> 1682.9189999999999
it'll literally not mean anything to you

1680.559 --> 1686.8799999999999
it'll just be like Devil's strength oh

1682.919 --> 1689.6000000000001
come on come on take this Take This Ring

1686.88 --> 1692.72
it's so it's so awesome look you could

1689.6 --> 1695.6789999999999
just have it oh yeah it's so safe like

1692.72 --> 1698.679
and they're like get away from me you

1695.679 --> 1701.88
Devils I'm here to do something you're

1698.679 --> 1701.88
just trying to distract

1706.44 --> 1709.44
me

1722.12 --> 1726.4399999999998
fibro

1723.44 --> 1726.44
yeah

1728.76 --> 1735.12
right well when power is the only thing

1731.48 --> 1738.279
you care about then when you have power

1735.12 --> 1740.84
you will brag about it you will brag

1738.279 --> 1743.32
about your nastiness or your

1740.84 --> 1747.32
lawlessness because you're you feel

1743.32 --> 1751.039
ensured you have enough power to make

1747.32 --> 1753.96
yeah to ensure that it doesn't matter

1751.039 --> 1756.0
that you violated the law right that's

1753.96 --> 1758.559
it's what power

1756.0 --> 1761.12
does when you have

1758.559 --> 1765.32
power you have to show up you have to

1761.12 --> 1767.8799999999999
brag about it by showing how much law

1765.32 --> 1772.6789999999999
doesn't apply to you Etc

1767.88 --> 1777.48
otherwise well You' not seem that

1772.679 --> 1777.48
powerful to other people that are power

1782.76 --> 1787.32
drunk power is a very disgusting

1788.24 --> 1795.3990000000001
thing when it actually affects your egoo

1791.679 --> 1800.279
when it when it takes hold of you like a

1795.399 --> 1800.279
sin like an addiction it's a horrible

1800.799 --> 1806.519
thing a dirty horrible shameful

1814.159 --> 1821.48
thing yes fbrs yeah like a serial killer

1818.64 --> 1823.64
they don't want to get caught but they

1821.48 --> 1826.64
want to

1823.64 --> 1830.0800000000002
brag about how what they did because

1826.64 --> 1830.0800000000002
they're Act proud of

1836.279 --> 1842.44
it and it's not like a sick enjoyment

1839.399 --> 1846.279
like it it's not even when Ser it's not

1842.44 --> 1850.2
even about like ha they're all scared oh

1846.279 --> 1853.919

what look at how [ __ ] brilliant I am

1853.919 --> 1859.8400000000001
that I was able to do this and just get

1857.12 --> 1862.84
away way SC free that's the thing they

1859.84 --> 1866.6789999999999
don't necessarily want to like oh I'm so

1862.84 --> 1869.12
scary h no that's like the too much

1866.679 --> 1872.279
cartoons watching is what that is yeah

1869.12 --> 1876.8799999999999

I can do

1899.84 --> 1904.0
anything all right and that is more

1901.96 --> 1907.3990000000001
Psychopathic because it's like they

1904.0 --> 1907.399
don't even care about the

1910.0 --> 1913.0
feelings

1916.159 --> 1919.159
anyway

1925.88 --> 1932.3200000000002
it's getting a bit dark the

1928.96 --> 1934.8400000000001
subject right so maybe let's move on to

1932.32 --> 1937.1589999999999
something that I put in the

1934.84 --> 1939.6789999999999
title it's taken a

1937.159 --> 1943.48
while but I've been thinking further

1939.679 --> 1943.48
about light and the nature of

1945.84 --> 1953.279
it in eduction right

1949.88 --> 1957.3600000000001
the the excitation of matter that that

1953.279 --> 1961.08
might have a speed just like with

1957.36 --> 1963.7199999999998
lightning and if it's instantaneous well

1961.08 --> 1963.72
what else is

1963.76 --> 1968.639
instantaneous field right field is

1966.84 --> 1971.4399999999998
instantaneous like a magnetic field is

1968.639 --> 1974.1999999999998
instantaneous it's

1971.44 --> 1978.8400000000001
there it doesn't have a

1974.2 --> 1980.919
speed it's just boom

1978.84 --> 1983.8799999999999
it's just

1980.919 --> 1985.6000000000001
there it can move with the object

1983.88 --> 1987.7600000000002
causing it but it's just there it

1985.6 --> 1991.9189999999999
doesn't have a speed it's there so I was

1987.76 --> 1991.919
thinking what if light is actually a

1995.519 --> 2000.559
field a field that can be blocked right

1999.0 --> 2002.919
because that's the thing about magnetism

2000.559 --> 2005.08
it can really be blocked although I'd

2002.919 --> 2008.159
like to know some more about it because

2005.08 --> 2009.76
I know that electricity a magnetism can

2008.159 --> 2013.72
be like

2009.76 --> 2014.8799999999999
insulated I think with certain plastic

2013.72 --> 2018.3990000000001
and

2014.88 --> 2022.3600000000001
rubber but I wonder like can a

2018.399 --> 2024.36
magnet be completely blocked in towards

2022.36 --> 2027.399
an entire Direction by

2024.36 --> 2029.639
Rubber cuz I know it can get go through

2027.399 --> 2031.12
the magnetism can go through like

2029.639 --> 2032.6789999999999
concrete or

2031.12 --> 2038.12
whatever

2032.679 --> 2040.3600000000001
but can it go through rubber and or will

2038.12 --> 2042.6789999999999
that rubber act or will you be able to

2040.36 --> 2045.76
have like one magnet on one side of the

2042.679 --> 2047.88
rubber like a block a substantial block

2045.76 --> 2050.48
of rubber one magnet on one side and

2047.88 --> 2052.7200000000003
another magnet on the other side or will

2050.48 --> 2055.2400000000002
that literally disable the magnetic

2052.72 --> 2058.5989999999997
field something in that direction I I

2055.24 --> 2058.5989999999997
need to know more about

2061.399 --> 2067.72
because could a field like a magnetic

2065.24 --> 2069.0
field basically be like

2067.72 --> 2071.52
a beam

2069.0 --> 2074.839
expression you see could a beam and a

2071.52 --> 2077.639
field be the same thing in a way that's

2074.839 --> 2079.72
my qu like I'm trying to be kind of

2077.639 --> 2082.2000000000003
creative still it's not very concrete

2079.72 --> 2082.2
yet

2082.48 --> 2088.2400000000002
ironically could light be a

2085.28 --> 2090.5600000000004
field and the beam is

2088.24 --> 2094.04
simply one

2090.56 --> 2099.44
fraction a fraction of the

2094.04 --> 2099.44
field and can be bent and

2112.28 --> 2118.0
everything right also like is magnetism

2115.72 --> 2121.16
and light

2118.0 --> 2123.64
generation is there a connection there

2121.16 --> 2123.64
like how

2124.359 --> 2129.96
much energy like

2127.76 --> 2132.48
it's like you have a piece of metal you

2129.96 --> 2135.0
you put electricity through it it can

2132.48 --> 2137.28
become magnetic right under the right

2135.0 --> 2138.359
circumstances and if you then amp it up

2137.28 --> 2142.079
so

2138.359 --> 2145.0789999999997
much like insanely much then literally

2142.079 --> 2147.88
that same metal will start glowing and

2145.079 --> 2147.88
giving off

2147.96 --> 2152.839
light yeah see how weird there is a

2151.52 --> 2158.68
direct

2152.839 --> 2161.88
connection electricity plus metal

2158.68 --> 2164.48
magnetism and then more

2161.88 --> 2169.2000000000003
electricity

2164.48 --> 2172.2
light magnetism field Light

2169.2 --> 2176.24
Beam both

2172.2 --> 2178.56
instantaneous is light like another form

2176.24 --> 2178.56
of

2180.04 --> 2185.72
magnetism I know this is all kind of

2182.24 --> 2187.24
primitive how I'm putting it down

2185.72 --> 2190.0789999999997
but

2187.24 --> 2190.0789999999997
I'm genuinely

2193.88 --> 2198.359
wondering there is no Shield or

2196.64 --> 2199.5989999999997
substance that will effectively block

2198.359 --> 2204.7999999999997
magnetic

2199.599 --> 2208.0
fields what about a faraday cage steamy

2204.8 --> 2210.319
traveler does it not because you can

2208.0 --> 2212.079
completely isolate electrical effects

2210.319 --> 2215.04
within a faraday

2212.079 --> 2218.6800000000003
gaug wouldn't it then also block

2215.04 --> 2218.68
magnetic fields

2223.56 --> 2229.44
okay our W

2226.4 --> 2231.28
report I've not been anything of I have

2229.44 --> 2233.92
nothing to do with your streets closing

2231.28 --> 2233.92
down last

2239.839 --> 2247.48
night can redirect magnetic field lines

2244.0 --> 2251.119
she very fascinating steam of tra

2247.48 --> 2251.119
there very very

2258.4 --> 2263.44
fascinating right so yeah if you yeah

2261.359 --> 2265.0
magnetic shielding would then be just

2263.44 --> 2268.88
like

2265.0 --> 2271.8
creating a powerful field of influence

2268.88 --> 2274.52
of magnetic influence that will

2271.8 --> 2274.52
influence

2274.92 --> 2282.0
whatever material or mat yeah whatever

2278.68 --> 2285.44
material enters or matter excitation

2282.0 --> 2287.96
like with lasers right it's light light

2285.44 --> 2289.7200000000003
is instant the matter excitation is what

2287.96 --> 2292.04
actually does the damage potentially

2289.72 --> 2295.2
talking about laser

2292.04 --> 2297.319
beams right magnetic Shield I mean Star

2295.2 --> 2299.1189999999997
Wars is full of this language by the way

2297.319 --> 2301.56
I I haven't even picked up on they talk

2299.119 --> 2304.6800000000003
about like magnetic shielding and they

2301.56 --> 2305.52
have a lot of like detail words for

2304.68 --> 2307.2
their

2305.52 --> 2309.96
weaponry

2307.2 --> 2312.72
which is kind of like you overlook that

2309.96 --> 2314.4
a lot a lot of sci-fi movies and stuff

2312.72 --> 2316.72
it's just like no you just have the

2314.4 --> 2318.88
weapon it just looks cool PE this is

2316.72 --> 2321.68
just really heavy that's it they don't

2318.88 --> 2324.7200000000003
talk about exactly what it is like oh

2321.68 --> 2326.3999999999996
this is the type of shielding they have

2324.72 --> 2328.7999999999997
Star Wars is actually full of that I

2326.4 --> 2331.44
kind of forgot that about it I watched

2328.8 --> 2335.44
the second Star Wars movie by the way

2331.44 --> 2335.44
Empire Strikes Back really good

2335.52 --> 2342.4
one I mean the story is just so

2338.599 --> 2342.4
good such a great

2344.079 --> 2348.5600000000004
story very serious

2352.48 --> 2357.44
anyway what's that what are you

2363.72 --> 2369.1189999999997
doing oh yeah that's not funny good

2375.119 --> 2383.6400000000003
call really a compass still works inside

2377.96 --> 2383.64
the par gauge a real one

2383.68 --> 2387.359
wow that is really

2388.319 --> 2393.04
bizarre have there been like further

2390.88 --> 2395.4
detailed studies on magnetic fields as

2393.04 --> 2399.68
to like what they really

2395.4 --> 2403.319
are like is a magnetic field like

2399.68 --> 2406.2
basically a fractal of micro Fields is

2403.319 --> 2408.359
that why you can't block it it's like oh

2406.2 --> 2409.68
it's a field but it's also a field and a

2408.359 --> 2411.359
field and a field and a field and a

2409.68 --> 2412.96
field and so if there's something being

2411.359 --> 2415.56
blocked it's like no the field in field

2412.96 --> 2419.0
in field is just like no it's

2415.56 --> 2421.24
everywhere you can't stop it because

2419.0 --> 2425.359
like how does it work how does a

2421.24 --> 2427.2
magnetic field actually work besides oh

2425.359 --> 2429.7999999999997
you

2427.2 --> 2432.2
you have the magnetic field originating

2429.8 --> 2435.6800000000003
from the mag magnet but

2432.2 --> 2438.64
but like what is a magnetic field

2435.68 --> 2438.64
basically that's my

2440.44 --> 2446.2400000000002
question right so one thing we can

2443.839 --> 2447.64
already tell from all this information

2446.24 --> 2448.8799999999997
thanks for that steam traveler by the

2447.64 --> 2450.5989999999997
way it's very

2448.88 --> 2454.0
helpful

2450.599 --> 2456.7200000000003
that magnetic fields are apparently very

2454.0 --> 2460.64
tenacious and hard to block is

2456.72 --> 2460.64
ironically light

2460.92 --> 2466.64
isn't light is not hard to

2465.04 --> 2471.72
block

2466.64 --> 2477.7599999999998
opacity it's very straightforward and

2471.72 --> 2477.7599999999998
common trait of matter that just blocks

2478.0 --> 2485.24
light so magnets are very hard to

2481.96 --> 2489.319
block but light is very easy to

2485.24 --> 2489.319
block they're both

2493.8 --> 2501.4
instantaneous and the funny thing is

2495.839 --> 2505.319
that well the very different trade guess

2501.4 --> 2505.319
oh yeah these are more questions

2506.8 --> 2514.8390000000004
like do magnetic fields

2510.56 --> 2518.2799999999997
like decrease at a distance permanently

2514.839 --> 2521.52
like can magnets with very sensitive

2518.28 --> 2524.5600000000004
sensors be detected even at a very fast

2521.52 --> 2526.04
distance because there's such a trace

2524.56 --> 2528.68
amount of

2526.04 --> 2531.8
magnetism or is it really like the

2528.68 --> 2533.72
magnet at some point it just stops and

2531.8 --> 2536.119
then right outside of it it's like

2533.72 --> 2538.52
there's no magnetism whatsoever like how

2536.119 --> 2541.319
does that work is a magnetic field

2538.52 --> 2544.48
created with with the

2541.319 --> 2546.72
magnet does it technically like have a

2544.48 --> 2550.559
half life over distance and then it just

2546.72 --> 2553.8799999999997
isn't influential enough but it's still

2550.559 --> 2556.92
you can still read it or is it just like

2553.88 --> 2559.839
it no at some point it's like the

2556.92 --> 2563.8
outside and then it's just poof no more

2559.839 --> 2563.7999999999997
influence whatsoever how does that work

2568.4 --> 2575.1600000000003
really anyway I'm gonna take a bite of

2570.96 --> 2578.16
this before it gets cooler

2575.16 --> 2578.16
cheers

2586.16 --> 2589.27
[Music]

2603.0 --> 2611.4
no Shaka obviously not

2607.52 --> 2611.4
blatantly obviously

2611.599 --> 2620.44
not it's not obviously directed energy

2616.28 --> 2622.88
weapons it's blatantly not directed

2620.44 --> 2622.88
energy

2624.599 --> 2627.599
weapons

2628.44 --> 2631.559
yeah I

2632.24 --> 2640.04
mean I'm sure you suspected that when I

2636.68 --> 2642.359
lit a cigarette the other day it was

2640.04 --> 2644.04
actually lit by a directed energy

2642.359 --> 2648.2
weapons

2644.04 --> 2648.2
but no it wasn't you

2650.839 --> 2658.52
see the whole result was completely

2653.839 --> 2658.52
different another cause has already been

2661.88 --> 2666.6800000000003
established so CA Burn yeah yeah that's

2665.0 --> 2669.76
right

2666.68 --> 2669.7599999999998
yeah that's called a

2669.8 --> 2677.599
firestorm yeah anything that is remotely

2674.079 --> 2681.7200000000003
flamable just bursts out into

2677.599 --> 2687.319
fire yeah but what it doesn't

2681.72 --> 2690.4399999999996
do firestorms is melt cars down into

2687.319 --> 2693.839
pudles of metal

2690.44 --> 2697.2000000000003
yeah that's what directed energy weapons

2693.839 --> 2699.2
do like in California

2697.2 --> 2701.4399999999996
where everything is just nice and green

2699.2 --> 2705.04
and completely unscorched and

2701.44 --> 2708.64
then like a house Stone House just

2705.04 --> 2712.16
completely disintegrated and cars where

2708.64 --> 2715.24
cars stand just pools of metal that's

2712.16 --> 2719.5989999999997
directed energy weapons

2715.24 --> 2722.4399999999996
Maui not directed energy weapons

2719.599 --> 2724.88
Firestorm cause

2722.44 --> 2729.7200000000003
established electrical

2724.88 --> 2732.76
fire shrubs not being cut down for fire

2729.72 --> 2734.04
safety yeah officially recognized

2732.76 --> 2738.0400000000004
officially

2734.04 --> 2742.2799999999997
admitted the cause of the Maui Firestorm

2738.04 --> 2742.2799999999997
has been established

2743.359 --> 2748.88
officially yeah not directed energy

2746.28 --> 2750.6800000000003
there how the [ __ ] would you even apply

2748.88 --> 2754.92
directed energy weapons during a

2750.68 --> 2756.5589999999997
freaking hurricane are you crazy how the

2754.92 --> 2759.28
hell are you going to do that

2756.559 --> 2762.1600000000003
like the only way to sort of do that

2759.28 --> 2765.2400000000002
would be to have like a freighter a very

2762.16 --> 2769.839
big ship because yeah you're not going

2765.24 --> 2772.5589999999997
to have an airplane in the sky firing a

2769.839 --> 2775.88
directed energy weapons during a

2772.559 --> 2778.88
hurricane because you're not

2775.88 --> 2778.88
[ __ ]

2779.559 --> 2784.88
yeah besides there's no evidence that

2782.16 --> 2786.68
directed energy weapons were used

2784.88 --> 2790.04
because cars

2786.68 --> 2791.24
despite being burned out were not pools

2790.04 --> 2793.599
of

2791.24 --> 2797.8799999999997
metal

2793.599 --> 2802.079
shrubs were all burned trees were all

2797.88 --> 2805.1600000000003
scorched no more green leaves left not

2802.079 --> 2807.48
completely burnt but scorched yeah when

2805.16 --> 2810.359
there's directed energy weapons around

2807.48 --> 2810.359
trees aren't

2811.079 --> 2816.88
scorched and cars aren't burned out

2814.44 --> 2821.2400000000002
they're pools of metal

2816.88 --> 2824.0
okay is that cleared up [ __ ] with

2821.24 --> 2826.4399999999996
conspiracy tart [ __ ] with is that clear

2824.0 --> 2826.44
enough for

2827.16 --> 2833.2
you [ __ ] [ __ ]

2830.76 --> 2834.92
yeah am I going to have to kick you out

2833.2 --> 2837.96
because you're a [ __ ] conspirator

2834.92 --> 2841.48
[ __ ] in my chat trying to muck up with

2837.96 --> 2844.7200000000003
your retardation and your ill drawn

2841.48 --> 2847.72
conclusions without

2844.72 --> 2847.72
evidence

2860.0 --> 2866.559
I've seen videos of melted cars not a

2862.839 --> 2866.5589999999997
Maui though not at

2871.119 --> 2877.2400000000002
all selective fire Stars yeah you know

2874.52 --> 2881.92
how they are selective

2877.24 --> 2885.2
by not cutting down the brushes in the

2881.92 --> 2889.2400000000002
specific area you want to have burned

2885.2 --> 2894.7599999999998
down by a firestorm yeah that's how you

2889.24 --> 2894.7599999999998
do that am I getting through de numnuts

2935.2 --> 2940.04
shut the the [ __ ]

2936.68 --> 2941.44
up and they'll get the [ __ ] out done

2940.04 --> 2943.359
with your retardation there's no

2941.44 --> 2946.64
directed energy weapons

2943.359 --> 2946.64
involved it's

2948.48 --> 2953.2400000000002
ridiculous Firestorm does a lot of

2953.28 --> 2957.2000000000003
damage and I don't believe you about

2955.68 --> 2961.359
melted cars

2957.2 --> 2965.0789999999997
because the overall situation wasn't

2961.359 --> 2967.799
there but hey a firestorm is literally

2965.079 --> 2971.079
like a low torch so yeah if your car

2967.799 --> 2975.16
happens to sit in exactly a crossing

2971.079 --> 2977.2400000000002
point where like maximum fire comes well

2975.16 --> 2978.96
then maybe some of those cars could

2977.24 --> 2981.799
completely be

2978.96 --> 2986.28
melted but it's not a sign of directed

2981.799 --> 2986.28
energy weapons at all at

2994.52 --> 2999.64
all

2996.799 --> 2999.64
thanks [ __ ]

3001.13 --> 3004.329
[Music]

3010.559 --> 3017.96
ad yeah there's no melted

3014.0 --> 3021.52
cars VI roads there's nothing there it's

3017.96 --> 3024.4
all burnt that's not melted that's

3021.52 --> 3026.4
burnt don't you [ __ ] sit on that

3024.4 --> 3029.64
[ __ ] train

3026.4 --> 3033.119
don't you [ __ ] dare fiber

3029.64 --> 3036.319
roats don't you [ __ ] dare be that

3033.119 --> 3038.2400000000002
[ __ ] stupid there's no directed

3036.319 --> 3040.64
energy weapons involved I'm not saying

3038.24 --> 3043.7599999999998
they don't exist I'm just saying not

3040.64 --> 3046.04
every [ __ ] thing every [ __ ] fire

3043.76 --> 3048.96
in the world is caused by a directed

3046.04 --> 3052.16
energy weapon you retards yeah there's

3048.96 --> 3054.599
such a thing as matches electrical fires

3052.16 --> 3056.5989999999997
yeah just because there's a thing out

3054.599 --> 3059.2400000000002
there doesn't mean mean that every

3056.599 --> 3061.4
[ __ ] thing in the world is now caused

3059.24 --> 3062.9599999999996
by that [ __ ] one

3061.4 --> 3066.76
thing

3062.96 --> 3070.2400000000002
okay now [ __ ] quit it already with

3066.76 --> 3070.2400000000002
your conspiratard

3072.359 --> 3078.5589999999997
idiocy there's already proof of a

3075.68 --> 3081.44
criminal setup I already explained it

3078.559 --> 3084.0
there is no directed energy weapons

3081.44 --> 3087.359
involved stop being a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3084.0 --> 3087.359
about it

3091.799 --> 3095.96
no molten cars the video does not have

3094.92 --> 3099.76
molten

3095.96 --> 3099.76
cars it's not the

3114.359 --> 3117.359
same

3139.52 --> 3143.079
like they scripted it this be no slow

3141.839 --> 3147.2799999999997
moon

3143.079 --> 3147.28
buggy it was a literal

3147.96 --> 3156.7200000000003
out it was a planned organized

3153.359 --> 3159.7599999999998
murder through deliberate

3156.72 --> 3162.72
negligence the oops by

3159.76 --> 3165.7200000000003
accident but this everything was

3162.72 --> 3168.0
there deliberate neglect they didn't cut

3165.72 --> 3171.64
down the the brushes which is standard

3168.0 --> 3174.799
policy like you have to do that it's

3171.64 --> 3178.1189999999997
criminal not to do that it's not the

3174.799 --> 3181.599
first fight Firestorm haai has ever

3178.119 --> 3186.599
had that's why they do it yeah and then

3181.599 --> 3190.28
they left the power on they didn't

3186.599 --> 3194.2000000000003
switch it off during the storm which is

3190.28 --> 3198.119
standard procedure you know why because

3194.2 --> 3200.24
electrical lines above ground break and

3198.119 --> 3204.6400000000003
then they caus

3200.24 --> 3207.5989999999997
fires it's all on record the entire

3204.64 --> 3211.04
thing is on record not directed energy

3207.599 --> 3213.52
weapons was a criminal setup by the

3211.04 --> 3216.319
[ __ ] government there they literally

3213.52 --> 3219.92
had police blockades preventing people

3216.319 --> 3219.92
from leaving the fire

3222.24 --> 3229.4399999999996
zone on record it's all on record

3225.4 --> 3230.28
there's nothing [ __ ] else okay it's

3229.44 --> 3232.76
right

3230.28 --> 3235.599
there the whole setup is there there's

3232.76 --> 3237.7990000000004
no [ __ ] directed energy weapons it's

3235.599 --> 3240.44
all completely there these people are

3237.799 --> 3243.64
going to go to jail at

3240.44 --> 3247.68
minimum because the perpetrators have

3243.64 --> 3250.64
been figured out the crimes have been

3247.68 --> 3253.44
back engineered it's completely there on

3250.64 --> 3256.96
record it's going to happen trials will

3253.44 --> 3256.96
come this is

3264.079 --> 3267.079
inevitable

3287.76 --> 3294.079
what LSG I can get pissed

3291.04 --> 3297.079
off I can't get what the [ __ ] is

3294.079 --> 3297.079
this

3305.119 --> 3310.319
I'm pissed off I'm pissed off at

3307.52 --> 3313.119
people like turning every [ __ ] little

3310.319 --> 3316.48
thing that happens in the world into a

3313.119 --> 3319.359
miracle like stop trying to live in a

3316.48 --> 3319.359
science fiction

3324.0 --> 3327.0
book

3341.88 --> 3345.149
[Music]

3354.0 --> 3362.92
m yeah that's not melted entirely to the

3358.079 --> 3362.92
ground that that a heavy fire will do

3366.96 --> 3372.0
that it's weird how those trees behind

3369.559 --> 3372.0
there I'll

3372.039 --> 3377.3590000000004
still that that is

3374.92 --> 3380.599
odd is this really in

3377.359 --> 3380.5989999999997
MyUI the

3383.44 --> 3386.92
[ __ ] h

3397.44 --> 3400.319
okay that is very

3403.88 --> 3408.92
odd like how the [ __ ] did that even

3406.44 --> 3412.16
catch flame then while all those trees

3408.92 --> 3412.16
behind didn't that is

3412.599 --> 3419.2000000000003
weird but where is even is this this is

3416.359 --> 3421.88
this like in the same place or is this

3419.2 --> 3421.8799999999997
like somewhere

3425.16 --> 3431.0789999999997
else I don't trust this I'm not trusting

3428.48 --> 3432.92
it I think there's misinformation

3431.079 --> 3435.6400000000003
rolling out there I've already seen it

3432.92 --> 3437.92
I've seen misinformation there's literal

3435.64 --> 3440.1189999999997
misinformation being

3437.92 --> 3443.44
created a

3440.119 --> 3443.44
Maui I'm not

3443.799 --> 3446.799
trusting

3465.839 --> 3471.0789999999997
no directed enery weapons are not sci-fi

3468.839 --> 3472.92
it's just not every [ __ ] fire in the

3471.079 --> 3476.799
world is caused by directed energy

3472.92 --> 3476.799
weapons that's my point

3489.799 --> 3495.319
all right but anyhow one thing I do know

3493.559 --> 3497.559
for certain and that is that the fires

3495.319 --> 3501.0
weren't started by directed energy

3497.559 --> 3503.2000000000003
weapons maybe there is a a

3501.0 --> 3505.68
thing but I don't know how the [ __ ]

3503.2 --> 3507.72
they'd even achieve something like that

3505.68 --> 3510.319
maybe they started

3507.72 --> 3513.64
like once they realized that their

3510.319 --> 3515.7599999999998
region was on fire that they just fired

3513.64 --> 3519.92
a bunch of directed energy weapons Into

3515.76 --> 3522.1600000000003
the Fire to like do more damage or

3519.92 --> 3524.319
something but it definitely wasn't

3522.16 --> 3529.1189999999997
started by directed energy weapons that

3524.319 --> 3529.119
is absolute fact but

3529.559 --> 3535.8100000000004
weird another fire

3533.72 --> 3538.9399999999996
what

3535.81 --> 3538.94
[Music]

3559.799 --> 3565.799
look all I want to know is if there are

3562.48 --> 3571.359
supposedly directed energy weapons

3565.799 --> 3574.799
from fired from where what fired them

3571.359 --> 3576.5589999999997
yeah it cannot be like a thing on the

3574.799 --> 3581.0389999999998
other side of the world or

3576.559 --> 3585.2000000000003
whatever a thousand kilometers away okay

3581.039 --> 3586.6800000000003
so what thing fired it then they have to

3585.2 --> 3588.799
have a big

3586.68 --> 3592.839
vehicle somehow

3588.799 --> 3597.24
Airborne or in the ocean to be able to

3592.839 --> 3600.96
do that so where the the [ __ ] was it

3597.24 --> 3602.799
then was there a freighter off the

3600.96 --> 3606.28
coast of

3602.799 --> 3608.599
Maui is there still one there is there

3606.28 --> 3608.599
where is

3623.24 --> 3629.1189999999997
it yeah that's right guy says so

3643.16 --> 3651.989
[Music]

3653.52 --> 3656.52
where

3657.28 --> 3663.3590000000004
dude go [ __ ] yourself

3660.92 --> 3665.92
speeder saying [ __ ] like that is what

3663.359 --> 3667.92
gets you kicked out of my chat if yall

3665.92 --> 3670.319
want to be like oh the entire world is

3667.92 --> 3672.359
getting light lit on fire everything's

3670.319 --> 3676.119
being lit up by directed energy weapons

3672.359 --> 3677.799
well go [ __ ] yourself then yeah I guess

3676.119 --> 3681.0
it's the end of the world everything's

3677.799 --> 3685.2
now going to go up in fire then at some

3681.0 --> 3687.92
point because of some remote thing yeah

3685.2 --> 3691.0789999999997
well good [ __ ] luck with

3687.92 --> 3693.52
that yeah this was an electrical fire

3691.079 --> 3696.039
that's what I

3693.52 --> 3698.839
seen how it

3696.039 --> 3701.599
progress criminal negligence was

3698.839 --> 3704.359
obviously there in official capacity

3701.599 --> 3706.3590000000004
like nothing else is [ __ ] even

3704.359 --> 3708.5989999999997
relevant

3706.359 --> 3713.359
man the

3708.599 --> 3713.3590000000004
perpetrators have already been

3713.44 --> 3716.44
caught

3719.279 --> 3725.68
just this stupid endless

3723.16 --> 3728.3999999999996
whining I don't want to have you here if

3725.68 --> 3731.0
you're just going to whine about all

3728.4 --> 3733.799
this weapons and so directed energy

3731.0 --> 3736.44
weapons is just another nukes now all of

3733.799 --> 3738.279
you are just whining about the new nukes

3736.44 --> 3740.64
oh the secret weapon we're all going to

3738.279 --> 3742.72
die go [ __ ]

3740.64 --> 3746.839
yourself yeah if that's what you want to

3742.72 --> 3746.839
do then I don't want you here in my

3765.839 --> 3768.839
chat

3770.88 --> 3778.2000000000003
dude yeah next time I'm kicking you out

3775.079 --> 3779.76
okay I I guess it's [ __ ] grass mowing

3778.2 --> 3783.279
time

3779.76 --> 3787.2000000000003
again bunch of retards trying to slip in

3783.279 --> 3790.0
[ __ ] making accusations here time to

3787.2 --> 3791.48
to ban some people again what you could

3790.0 --> 3793.799
think you could slip in with your

3791.48 --> 3793.799
[ __ ]

3797.119 --> 3800.119
horeshit

3802.16 --> 3808.24
no yeah that's really cool yeah I never

3805.279 --> 3810.64
denied that they exist okay I never

3808.24 --> 3815.16
denied that those things

3810.64 --> 3817.4
exist I'm just saying where where was it

3815.16 --> 3821.279
where is the

3817.4 --> 3824.88
device where was it on the night of the

3821.279 --> 3829.96
event where stop whining about that

3824.88 --> 3829.96
those things exist show me where it

3833.279 --> 3836.279
was

3844.079 --> 3849.92
yeah I know Richard G yeah the one in

3847.039 --> 3849.92
Canada was very

3851.92 --> 3856.44
suspect but at the same

3857.44 --> 3863.2000000000003
time it could very well have been just

3860.119 --> 3864.92
lit by hand in Canada

3863.2 --> 3867.5589999999997
simultaneously

3864.92 --> 3871.44
so unless you're going to actually trace

3867.559 --> 3873.599
it back to a device like oh look there

3871.44 --> 3877.319
is the

3873.599 --> 3878.76
device oh look now it is happening yeah

3877.319 --> 3881.5589999999997
that's

3878.76 --> 3883.3190000000004
proof not just shouting oh this fire

3881.559 --> 3886.44
that fire oh it can't be any other way

3883.319 --> 3891.4
oh everything's costed by wa yeah then

3886.44 --> 3893.96
the [ __ ] wa is now your nuke

3891.4 --> 3897.319
congratulations Satan rules your world

3893.96 --> 3897.319
again again you [ __ ]

3901.2 --> 3908.16
idiots start by actually proving it was

3904.92 --> 3911.64
there prove it prove that it was there

3908.16 --> 3911.64
otherwise stop whining about

3923.079 --> 3926.079
it

3936.88 --> 3942.92
barely know what they are well I get

3939.0 --> 3942.92
undirected energy weapons it's not that

3944.119 --> 3951.48
complicated but the point

3948.16 --> 3956.0789999999997
is if it's supposedly causing something

3951.48 --> 3956.079
well then where is it then

3957.119 --> 3963.359
yeah stop imagining these things being

3960.52 --> 3966.119
everywhere without actually proving that

3963.359 --> 3969.319
they're there when a fire that you think

3966.119 --> 3973.359
is caused by it happens [ __ ] prove it

3969.319 --> 3973.359
already stop whining about

3983.0 --> 3987.72
it

3984.68 --> 3990.5989999999997
according to Maxwell phoms are like

3987.72 --> 3992.16
electric fi oh I didn't even know that

3990.599 --> 3994.52
that's

3992.16 --> 3998.0389999999998
interesting yeah qwi by the way thinks

3994.52 --> 3999.92
that Maxwell is completely Punk so just

3998.039 --> 4002.88
giving you heads up this is for me it's

3999.92 --> 4005.2000000000003
all exploration like I've never read

4002.88 --> 4005.2000000000003
about

4005.839 --> 4011.0389999999998
Maxwell This is just ex no that's not

4008.319 --> 4015.68
entirely true I have known about maxo a

4011.039 --> 4017.6400000000003
while back kind of forgot about it

4015.68 --> 4019.7599999999998
but Q is not on with him but I don't

4017.64 --> 4021.72
give a [ __ ] because I'm on an Eclectic

4019.76 --> 4024.599
journey of Discovery and I don't give a

4021.72 --> 4024.5989999999997
[ __ ] what anybody

4028.44 --> 4032.96
says including self-proclaimed

4040.079 --> 4045.2000000000003
experts

4041.68 --> 4047.8799999999997
right but yeah I mean like maybe it is a

4045.2 --> 4051.16
field maybe it really

4047.88 --> 4051.1600000000003
is I don't

4068.68 --> 4074.52
know give a [ __ ] about no I'm just

4071.88 --> 4077.2400000000002
referencing people with their exper

4074.52 --> 4082.2
that say oh no don't go into

4077.24 --> 4084.9199999999996
that that's the part that I don't care

4082.2 --> 4087.2
about I do care what people say in my

4084.92 --> 4089.96
chat but I do also get pissed off when

4087.2 --> 4091.8799999999997
people in my chat are just getting

4089.96 --> 4095.119
conspiratard about

4091.88 --> 4096.88
things it pisses me off I don't want to

4095.119 --> 4099.319
deal with

4096.88 --> 4101.719
that I don't want to get all hyped up

4099.319 --> 4105.1990000000005
about how the world's going to

4101.719 --> 4108.0
[ __ ] because you're just going to fault

4105.199 --> 4110.759
assume they're the worst I just don't

4108.0 --> 4113.4
want to deal with that yeah the world

4110.759 --> 4117.679
already is going to [ __ ] well enough on

4113.4 --> 4120.4
its own without any of us just putting

4117.679 --> 4124.4
maximum [ __ ] piles on

4120.4 --> 4127.759
top yeah I'm so sick of that I'm sick of

4124.4 --> 4130.3189999999995
having to deal with people that do that

4127.759 --> 4132.799
continually I don't want to hear about

4130.319 --> 4135.799
your conspirator

4132.799 --> 4135.799
nonsense

4146.719 --> 4151.759
having that g that tell me like oh

4148.64 --> 4154.839
you've been misinformed by mainstream

4151.759 --> 4156.96
media go [ __ ] yourself you scumbag what

4154.839 --> 4159.799
you think that I can't see that I can't

4156.96 --> 4162.44
tell the difference what I'm

4159.799 --> 4165.839
seeing from what people are saying about

4162.44 --> 4169.199
it go [ __ ] you yourself this is my

4165.839 --> 4171.759
[ __ ] field this is my expertise it's

4169.199 --> 4174.879999999999
literally all I ever do all day long

4171.759 --> 4177.199
yeah watch [ __ ] media it's literally

4174.88 --> 4177.1990000000005
my

4177.839 --> 4183.759
life don't [ __ ] tell me that I don't

4181.56 --> 4187.4400000000005
get it yeah [ __ ]

4183.759 --> 4187.44
with where the hell you

4192.12 --> 4200.239
are you listen to wit in oh God

4196.159 --> 4200.239
yes it's very tedious

4204.199 --> 4209.96
though and after the initial first hour

4207.4 --> 4213.159
and a half I never got there

4209.96 --> 4215.199
richardy I I couldn't take any like more

4213.159 --> 4219.04
than half an hour of that [ __ ] angry

4215.199 --> 4222.36
show today hey maybe maybe I just kick

4219.04 --> 4225.08
you the [ __ ] out and it's none of your

4222.36 --> 4226.96
[ __ ] business Mr

4225.08 --> 4229.5599999999995
newcomer

4226.96 --> 4232.32
huh yeah we had some great conversation

4229.56 --> 4235.56
yeah that doesn't mean you own me now as

4232.32 --> 4238.36
a friend you hear you're a newcomer

4235.56 --> 4239.719
maybe you don't get to say how the [ __ ]

4238.36 --> 4243.239
I run my

4239.719 --> 4243.2390000000005
show how about

4244.88 --> 4247.88
that

4249.64 --> 4255.04
yeah right stey traveler doesn't even

4252.84 --> 4257.679
get to say that

4255.04 --> 4262.76
and he's been following me for years

4257.679 --> 4266.88
yeah so you Mr newcomer in less than a

4262.76 --> 4269.96
week certainly don't get the right to

4266.88 --> 4273.6
say that in my chat

4269.96 --> 4274.679
yeah maybe I'll move on when I [ __ ]

4273.6 --> 4279.320000000001
feel like

4274.679 --> 4281.96
it maybe I'll get angry when I choose to

4279.32 --> 4285.679
and it doesn't make it an angry show it

4281.96 --> 4288.4
just makes me angry in that moment until

4285.679 --> 4290.28
there's no more reason to be angry

4288.4 --> 4292.599999999999
yeah is that

4290.28 --> 4294.759999999999
clear I don't care if it's clear because

4292.6 --> 4294.76
you're

4307.159 --> 4312.5599999999995
banned excitation of the medium is what

4310.56 --> 4315.120000000001
we observe light

4312.56 --> 4317.88
is well when you try to look at it from

4315.12 --> 4317.88
the side

4319.199 --> 4324.32
yeah no but this excitation of the

4321.76 --> 4328.96
medium it makes a lot of sense to me I

4324.32 --> 4328.96
literally talked about it on my show

4333.88 --> 4339.679
yesterday which it could not be more

4336.199 --> 4342.678999999999
wrong why why could he not be more wrong

4339.679 --> 4345.639
look this whole [ __ ] that he talks about

4342.679 --> 4348.4400000000005
it just not has nothing to do with ether

4345.639 --> 4351.6
right if you just cut The Ether nonsense

4348.44 --> 4354.599999999999
out of his explanation it's perfectly

4351.6 --> 4356.719
fine yeah what we get to see that has a

4354.6 --> 4357.92
speed is the excitation of matter it's a

4356.719 --> 4360.52
very

4357.92 --> 4363.84
reasonable

4360.52 --> 4365.679
idea it's very reasonable yeah it has

4363.84 --> 4367.84
nothing to do with ether though yeah

4365.679 --> 4370.719
there's no necessity for ether ether is

4367.84 --> 4375.159000000001
like a stupid mathematical framework

4370.719 --> 4379.719
add-on that has no reason to exist or be

4375.159 --> 4379.719
conceived of it's literally

4380.32 --> 4386.199
Superfluous right is not involved in

4384.0 --> 4389.08
trying to explain the nature of light at

4386.199 --> 4391.919999999999
all it's all horeshit the only reason

4389.08 --> 4393.6
why it had to exist why an ether would

4391.92 --> 4395.6
be necessary is if you had the

4393.6 --> 4397.6
misconception that light was a wave

4395.6 --> 4398.719
which it isn't and it doesn't have a

4397.6 --> 4403.6
speed

4398.719 --> 4407.32
either so ether is just superfluous

4403.6 --> 4409.96
sense there's no reason to to even con

4407.32 --> 4409.96
conceive of

4420.95 --> 4424.01
[Music]

4432.36 --> 4435.36
it

4462.28 --> 4465.28
for

4470.88 --> 4475.4400000000005
[Music]

4472.48 --> 4478.159
he talking about photons yeah

4475.44 --> 4479.96
yeah now the whole thing was ridiculous

4478.159 --> 4482.839999999999
Richard

4479.96 --> 4485.52
G but I mean I couldn't really follow it

4482.84 --> 4488.28
though it was just very hard to sit

4485.52 --> 4490.120000000001
through that and there was gigantic

4488.28 --> 4492.28
amount of trolls in the chat too was

4490.12 --> 4495.28
quite

4492.28 --> 4495.28
annoying

4502.08 --> 4508.28
each Photon kicks off

4505.04 --> 4511.719
yeah but it's not a unit though it's

4508.28 --> 4515.08
just a quanta maximum flat

4511.719 --> 4517.6
yes but nobody really addresses that

4515.08 --> 4519.4
because people that whine about photons

4517.6 --> 4523.4800000000005
whine about

4519.4 --> 4525.679
the misconceived idea that most most

4523.48 --> 4529.44
people don't even really hang on to that

4525.679 --> 4532.6
much they just like to overemphasize it

4529.44 --> 4535.719
that photons are like an a unit an

4532.6 --> 4539.280000000001
indivisible unit like an atom right it's

4535.719 --> 4542.32
atom Atomic thinking Atomic reification

4539.28 --> 4544.599999999999
of photons that's what

4542.32 --> 4547.36
happening these people that think that

4544.6 --> 4549.92
photons don't exist because they're

4547.36 --> 4552.199
straw Manning it they think that they're

4549.92 --> 4555.679
straw man

4552.199 --> 4558.4
atomist idea of what a photon is

4555.679 --> 4559.88
represent supposedly representing that's

4558.4 --> 4561.719
what they don't believe in but that's

4559.88 --> 4567.36
not the

4561.719 --> 4567.36
claim they're strawmanning what a photon

4567.88 --> 4574.56
is yeah that's right maximum

4571.0 --> 4577.44
platus discrete unit of energy

4574.56 --> 4581.159000000001
right and that discrete unit of energy

4577.44 --> 4583.599999999999
could potentially be less it's just

4581.159 --> 4587.32
that's the amount you need admitt minum

4583.6 --> 4587.320000000001
to trigger the photoelectric

4588.199 --> 4594.879999999999
effect it's still an amount it's not a

4591.52 --> 4598.679
thing it's not an indivisible unit it's

4594.88 --> 4601.04
an amount which means it could be less

4598.679 --> 4605.639
it could be slightly more there could be

4601.04 --> 4605.639
one and a half Photon worth of

4606.8 --> 4614.08
energy I bet you yeah because it's not a

4611.679 --> 4617.12
unit it's not a

4614.08 --> 4619.6
marble that has to be as big as exactly

4617.12 --> 4622.5599999999995
that marble that is a photon that's not

4619.6 --> 4624.76
a photon it's just an amount and it's

4622.56 --> 4627.6
the amount that is required to trigger

4624.76 --> 4630.12
the photoelectric effect that's what a

4627.6 --> 4630.120000000001
photon

4633.36 --> 4638.08
is do I really what the [ __ ] are you

4636.08 --> 4640.6
talking about no I don't

4638.08 --> 4642.0
realize how who the [ __ ] gave him a

4640.6 --> 4645.0
[ __ ]

4642.0 --> 4645.0
wrench

4646.239 --> 4652.5599999999995
how the hell did that

4648.08 --> 4652.5599999999995
happen who the [ __ ] is handing out

4659.08 --> 4663.0
wrenches the [ __ ] is

4664.0 --> 4672.0
this I'm going to remove all

4668.239 --> 4675.0
wrenches somebody's [ __ ] with my

4672.0 --> 4675.0
wrenches

4679.48 --> 4686.199
when the hell did I I didn't give him a

4681.56 --> 4686.1990000000005
[ __ ] wrench who the [ __ ] did

4701.92 --> 4704.92
that

4726.719 --> 4731.92
see if there's more people in here that

4728.44 --> 4734.919999999999
have wrenches that I've never even heard

4731.92 --> 4734.92
of

4745.84 --> 4750.4800000000005
at least there's no managing moderators

4748.0 --> 4750.48
that's one

4752.84 --> 4761.84
thing just needed to make sure of

4756.76 --> 4763.92
that what the [ __ ] who the hell is

4761.84 --> 4768.360000000001
that

4763.92 --> 4768.36
see people in I've never even heard of

4785.08 --> 4790.04
them I don't get it is that might be

4788.239 --> 4793.919999999999
people changing their names I'm just

4790.04 --> 4796.6
[ __ ] I'm just going crazy with these

4793.92 --> 4797.88
people just have wrenches I don't

4796.6 --> 4801.120000000001
recognize

4797.88 --> 4802.96
them did I give maximum flatus a wrench

4801.12 --> 4806.599999999999
any anytime

4802.96 --> 4806.6
recently when did that

4812.52 --> 4818.2390000000005
happen [ __ ] sake I'm not I'm not handing

4815.28 --> 4820.639
out any more wrenches it's over nobody

4818.239 --> 4823.678999999999
gets a wrench anymore you can now from

4820.639 --> 4826.679
now on only lose wrenches there will be

4823.679 --> 4829.52
no more ranches I'm done I'm not giving

4826.679 --> 4831.12
out any more ranches ever again I'm

4829.52 --> 4834.159000000001
[ __ ]

4831.12 --> 4837.44
done all these [ __ ] people just

4834.159 --> 4837.44
sneaking in with their

4851.719 --> 4854.719
crap

4868.0 --> 4871.92
I guess today is a bit of a Rowdy

4873.52 --> 4880.4800000000005
[Music]

4876.4 --> 4880.48
day I didn't mean to do

4881.159 --> 4886.159
that just

4883.52 --> 4887.88
stop whining about [ __ ] dired energy

4886.159 --> 4889.839999999999
weapons I mean I'm going to put that

4887.88 --> 4891.76
word in the [ __ ] band list like I

4889.84 --> 4894.679
don't want to hear anything about it

4891.76 --> 4898.08
anymore I'm so [ __ ] sick of people

4894.679 --> 4902.04
whining about directed energy

4898.08 --> 4903.719
weapons so [ __ ] sick of directed

4902.04 --> 4907.96
energy weapon

4903.719 --> 4907.96
whining I don't want to hear it

4911.639 --> 4914.639
anymore

4941.56 --> 4944.56
okay

4964.48 --> 4971.44
yeah just so you know if anybody accuses

4967.36 --> 4974.759999999999
anybody else if a wrench in in my chat

4971.44 --> 4978.638999999999
accuses any body in the chat that has a

4974.76 --> 4982.76
wrench of not being who they say they

4978.639 --> 4986.36
are you they lose that wrench no matter

4982.76 --> 4987.92
what yeah that's the rule now teret so

4986.36 --> 4989.44
you better [ __ ] be sure about what

4987.92 --> 4992.04
you're saying because if you're going to

4989.44 --> 4994.799999999999
accuse anybody like even if it was O

4992.04 --> 4996.88
here or slow-mo moon buggy of not being

4994.8 --> 4999.52
who they say they are you're going to

4996.88 --> 5002.0
tell them oh that's actually the other

4999.52 --> 5004.280000000001
person with a wrench I will take their

5002.0 --> 5006.639
wrench even if you're wrong just so you

5004.28 --> 5011.639
know ter

5006.639 --> 5014.76
it you hear me any accusation towards

5011.639 --> 5016.96
another means they immediately lose

5014.76 --> 5019.56
their wrench because you accuse them of

5016.96 --> 5023.28
it is that clear hope that you're going

5019.56 --> 5023.280000000001
to take some responsibility

5024.56 --> 5030.400000000001
now I don't care about your refutation

5028.48 --> 5033.32
of a claim I'm telling you some

5030.4 --> 5036.48
instructions right now

5033.32 --> 5039.639
you accuse maximum flatus of being Dr

5036.48 --> 5041.0
Phil Bell Dr Phil Bell doesn't have the

5039.639 --> 5043.4800000000005
right to be in my

5041.0 --> 5047.28
chat because you accused him of it

5043.48 --> 5047.28
whether that was true or not I took his

5049.36 --> 5054.0
wrench yeah Revelation whatever you

5052.32 --> 5056.12
better damn well be sure that you're

5054.0 --> 5060.239
right about it because I just took his

5056.12 --> 5064.36
wrench because you said so teret I hope

5060.239 --> 5064.36
you know the responsibility of that

5073.12 --> 5079.32
so if you're ever going to call anybody

5076.56 --> 5082.04
somebody else again you better [ __ ]

5079.32 --> 5083.92
be sure of it because because of you I

5082.04 --> 5087.8
will take their

5083.92 --> 5090.76
wrench and not give it back just so you

I don't know what the [ __ ] going

5611.56 --> 5617.159000000001
on is the weather

5615.199 --> 5620.759999999999
nah I don't

5617.159 --> 5623.638999999999
know yesterday was such a fun day I mean

5620.76 --> 5623.639
yesterday's show was

5626.48 --> 5630.5599999999995
hilarious today for some reason I know

5629.199 --> 5633.5599999999995
what it

5630.56 --> 5633.56
is

5636.36 --> 5640.159
just seem to be kind of pissed

5641.08 --> 5645.679
off right and I'm not really making

5643.52 --> 5647.2390000000005
super headways with the light being a

5645.679 --> 5649.56
field I

5647.239 --> 5652.119
mean maybe it was just a mistake

5649.56 --> 5652.119000000001
starting

5658.36 --> 5664.44
this Al I laid it down but it's like

5661.76 --> 5666.719
yeah comparison comparison just

5664.44 --> 5669.199
comparing all the time I'm like I'm

5666.719 --> 5673.44
fascinated by the comparison between a

5669.199 --> 5675.44
magnetic field and light that's it

5673.44 --> 5678.719
that's where I'm at now that's just the

5675.44 --> 5682.159
thing I'm just doing a ratio test yeah

5678.719 --> 5684.96
this is internal ratio contemplation

5682.159 --> 5687.0
like magnetism light magnetism light

5684.96 --> 5690.0
magnetism light mag like how is it

5687.0 --> 5694.639
different how is the same what about it

5690.0 --> 5697.0
is different right and Etc just keeping

5694.639 --> 5699.8
keeping that continually going that's

5697.0 --> 5701.76
been happening like the last few days

5699.8 --> 5704.04
and just noticing like yeah there may be

5701.76 --> 5707.320000000001
more similarities than originally took

5704.04 --> 5709.44
for granted just being too distracted by

5707.32 --> 5711.759999999999
this false dichotomy of the particle

5709.44 --> 5711.759999999999
wave

5719.32 --> 5723.799999999999
Duality it's something in the ether

5721.8 --> 5727.119000000001
that's very

5723.8 --> 5727.119000000001
funny I don't

5728.44 --> 5733.839999999999
know haven't even touched my

5731.06 --> 5737.52
[Music]

5733.84 --> 5739.6
gust I'm also pissed off that my

5737.52 --> 5742.040000000001
roommates there because that means that

5739.6 --> 5745.280000000001
I can't yell as loud as I would like or

5742.04 --> 5747.88
start whining get about it

5745.28 --> 5753.4
again I do feel

5747.88 --> 5753.400000000001
very frustrated in ways

5756.32 --> 5760.4
I've been having a lot of confrontations

5758.32 --> 5763.199
on a personal level as to like what I'm

5760.4 --> 5763.199
doing if it's

5763.32 --> 5768.119
Justified

5764.92 --> 5770.76
because I see it like

5768.119 --> 5772.0
this this and this is like oh the trolls

5770.76 --> 5774.04
are going to love this I don't give a

5772.0 --> 5775.84
[ __ ] I'll kick you out immediately I

5774.04 --> 5781.159
don't care but

5775.84 --> 5783.32
like is what I do working in the eyes of

5781.159 --> 5783.32
God

5785.639 --> 5790.52
that is the question is what I do work

5788.28 --> 5792.5199999999995
is the whole thing my whole effort is

5790.52 --> 5797.0
this

5792.52 --> 5801.040000000001
work like not if other people see it as

5797.0 --> 5804.4
work I wouldn't give a fleeting [ __ ] if

5801.04 --> 5806.239
they thought that I was be working or

5804.4 --> 5808.879999999999
just wasting my time all day I don't

5806.239 --> 5812.239
give a [ __ ] I only care whether God sees

5808.88 --> 5816.08
it like that and whether I see it like

5812.239 --> 5817.959999999999
that cuz if I see if I feel like

5816.08 --> 5821.04
everything I do is just a waste of time

5817.96 --> 5821.04
yeah that's not good for

5822.679 --> 5829.92
morale so is what I do actually work in

5827.159 --> 5833.879999999999
the eyes of God or is it not I'm

5829.92 --> 5837.52
attempting for that but is

5833.88 --> 5840.2390000000005
it or am I going to get like it after my

5837.52 --> 5844.159000000001
life this gigantic bill of like yeah you

5840.239 --> 5848.239
got like you owe the world 80 years of

5844.159 --> 5851.799999999999
work you didn't do it because you

5848.239 --> 5853.32
avoided social pressure [ __ ] which is

5851.8 --> 5856.679
arguably

5853.32 --> 5859.5599999999995
true that's the reason it's because of

5856.679 --> 5862.36
social [ __ ] every time it's just like

5859.56 --> 5866.4800000000005
can't get along with people can't handle

5862.36 --> 5869.119
other people like dominating me when

5866.48 --> 5871.32
they're [ __ ] retards just because

5869.119 --> 5874.598999999999
they're in a higher function like I I

5871.32 --> 5874.599
just can't deal with that

5876.92 --> 5882.92
crap like cocking to that has proven to

5881.52 --> 5887.8
be

5882.92 --> 5889.08
extremely detrimental on my like on on a

5887.8 --> 5893.679
physical

5889.08 --> 5897.679
level to me like doing that like it

5893.679 --> 5900.119
depletes me it takes away my sense of

5897.679 --> 5903.119
wanting to live

5900.119 --> 5903.119
literally

5903.199 --> 5908.598999999999
and this this show this what I do

5906.48 --> 5913.598999999999
following the media figuring things out

5908.599 --> 5914.679
dream walking developing my eclectic

5913.599 --> 5920.0
spiritual

5914.679 --> 5924.599
ways it's like the only thing in my life

5920.0 --> 5926.96
that hasn't led to the same kind of

5924.599 --> 5929.32
depletion because when you allow

5926.96 --> 5931.199
yourself to get DEET when I and I'm

5929.32 --> 5933.639
going to let's just keep it to me I

5931.199 --> 5936.0
don't know how it affects you guys but

5933.639 --> 5939.8
with me like

5936.0 --> 5942.639
depletion leads to I don't give a [ __ ]

5939.8 --> 5944.639
about anything anymore that's what that

5942.639 --> 5947.4400000000005
leads to with me it leads to the point

5944.639 --> 5949.719
where like I don't even care if like

5947.44 --> 5953.08
beautiful people just get murdered like

5949.719 --> 5955.599
I just stop caring about everything

5953.08 --> 5955.599
because of

5957.92 --> 5964.88
that and it's scary to remember having

5962.599 --> 5968.96
been in that state where I just don't

5964.88 --> 5968.96
care anymore it's

5980.04 --> 5985.88
scary hey that's interesting did I watch

5984.04 --> 5989.76
Alex J with

5985.88 --> 5992.599
am yeah I did watch it it

5989.76 --> 5995.04
was re

5992.599 --> 5997.96
ridiculous but

5995.04 --> 6001.5199999999995
also a little interesting here and there

5997.96 --> 6003.92
but I mean seriously like it's it's gay

6001.52 --> 6007.1990000000005
and [ __ ] these two together is just

6003.92 --> 6009.08
gay and [ __ ] like they are I I can't

6007.199 --> 6013.44
get over

6009.08 --> 6016.5599999999995
this it's really

6013.44 --> 6016.5599999999995
H I

6019.44 --> 6024.48
mean it was just it's like a poser

6022.08 --> 6024.48
puppet

6025.639 --> 6030.639
show it's just h i it

6032.08 --> 6038.32
just it was annoying I thought it was

6035.08 --> 6040.159
annoying watching that I I think that

6038.32 --> 6043.5199999999995
Andrew Tate is very

6040.159 --> 6046.159
annoying and he brings out annoying

6043.52 --> 6048.76
parts of in Alex Jones too because Alex

6046.159 --> 6050.5599999999995
Jones has a lot of annoying sides to him

6048.76 --> 6051.84
and Andrew Tate brings out those

6050.56 --> 6056.8
annoying

6051.84 --> 6056.8
sides it's I just

6056.84 --> 6064.719
H now for my actual Andrew Tate related

6061.32 --> 6067.239
reviews I refer to Owen Benjamin Owen

6064.719 --> 6072.76
Benjamin had a great video of an

6067.239 --> 6072.759999999999
interview with Andrew Andrew K Andrew

6073.159 --> 6079.679

that

6139.76 --> 6145.159000000001
cheers

6142.199 --> 6150.96
but seriously that video of Andrew

6145.159 --> 6150.96
tape that was made with that was like so

6151.8 --> 6154.8
funny

6159.84 --> 6165.1990000000005
H let me see let's see if he posted it

6162.56 --> 6166.119000000001
separately that would be amazing damn it

6165.199 --> 6169.759999999999
he

6166.119 --> 6172.759999999999
didn't was so

6169.76 --> 6172.76
funny

6172.84 --> 6177.84
it was basically like that interview he

6175.0 --> 6181.719
did about with that woman that like oh

6177.84 --> 6185.400000000001
but you mind controlled women into doing

6181.719 --> 6188.52
stuff for you prostituting themselves or

6185.4 --> 6190.5199999999995
something and then Andrew Tate trying to

6188.52 --> 6192.159000000001
justify that oh blah you know what he

6190.52 --> 6194.4800000000005
does it's like this thing that's gone

6192.159 --> 6199.5599999999995
around and then Owen Benjamin instead

6194.48 --> 6201.239
just talks like a [ __ ] I'm inry day

6199.56 --> 6203.400000000001
and that's like played over

6201.239 --> 6206.638999999999
it's one of the funniest videos I've

6203.4 --> 6206.638999999999
seen this

6211.239 --> 6217.04
month I'm top G Andrew

6217.8 --> 6224.719

okay I got a

6402.69 --> 6405.799999999999
[Music]

6409.4 --> 6412.4
Bugatti

6416.679 --> 6420.639
by the

6418.04 --> 6423.08
way I've gotten through season one of

6420.639 --> 6425.92
lock and key and holy [ __ ] I didn't even

6423.08 --> 6429.28
realize there were like two more of them

6425.92 --> 6431.639
Jesus but man it's been a very

6429.28 --> 6435.639
heavy intense

6431.639 --> 6435.639
siries Ser is very

6436.199 --> 6442.32
good one of the best Netflix series I've

6439.8 --> 6442.320000000001
seen this

6454.719 --> 6459.32
far like at the end of season was I was

6457.56 --> 6462.2390000000005
genuinely shocked that there were two

6459.32 --> 6464.119
more seasons like wait what I just

6462.239 --> 6466.678999999999
expected that there would only be one

6464.119 --> 6469.4
season because then that the effort

6466.679 --> 6471.32
would have run out or something because

6469.4 --> 6473.5599999999995
they put in a lot lot of effort into

6471.32 --> 6473.5599999999995
this

6499.239 --> 6502.239
thing

6508.92 --> 6513.2390000000005
I'm just

6510.599 --> 6515.400000000001
wondering spoilers for lock and key

6513.239 --> 6517.36
people if they haven't watched it I'm

6515.4 --> 6521.0
just wondering if like

6517.36 --> 6524.28
the these the Demonic bullets that came

6521.0 --> 6525.32
out of the Omega door that try to

6524.28 --> 6527.759999999999
possess

6525.32 --> 6531.28
people and then if they miss they just

6527.76 --> 6535.400000000001
turn into this lump of metal

6531.28 --> 6535.4
is that what the magic keys are made

6535.639 --> 6540.36
of because I'm totally anticipating that

6538.8 --> 6542.360000000001
I was like yeah when are they going to

6540.36 --> 6545.28
find out that those bullet things are

6542.36 --> 6548.0
actually the magic keys origin because

6545.28 --> 6552.119
it has to be it's like my architectural

6548.0 --> 6555.92
internal person is just like they must

6552.119 --> 6558.839999999999
have that like it has to be this that

6555.92 --> 6562.4800000000005
right the the bullets have to be the M

6558.84 --> 6564.159000000001
they must be the magic e like that they

6562.48 --> 6568.4
are

6564.159 --> 6572.239
effectively like demon in origin like it

6568.4 --> 6575.44
has to be that it's the only logical

6572.239 --> 6579.159
architectural way to to put it down

6575.44 --> 6581.799999999999
so it hasn't been revealed yet

6579.159 --> 6585.638999999999
though but I'm I'm like kind of betting

6581.8 --> 6588.8
on I this one i' p money on that those

6585.639 --> 6591.1990000000005
Omega door bullets are going to turn out

6588.8 --> 6594.96
to be the thing that the magic keys are

6591.199 --> 6599.36
made of am I right or did everybody just

6594.96 --> 6599.36
leave all of a sudden now that's

6607.3 --> 6614.58
[Music]

6619.04 --> 6622.04
fine

6627.52 --> 6634.76
right I'll unban Planet Earthling

6631.8 --> 6637.2390000000005
but don't say something as stupid again

6634.76 --> 6638.8
like oh I heard Benjamin is not a flat

6637.239 --> 6642.36
earther you heard

6638.8 --> 6642.360000000001
wrong you heard

6649.04 --> 6652.04
wrong

6654.719 --> 6658.199
you're afraid of teret

6660.52 --> 6666.0
good cuz teret is like Indian police the

6664.119 --> 6668.159
ones that if you don't directly do what

6666.0 --> 6670.76
they tell you he beats you with a

6668.159 --> 6673.638999999999
stick I like that kind of police I think

6670.76 --> 6677.639
that we need that kind of police again

6673.639 --> 6677.639
instead of the fat wastified

6677.679 --> 6683.63
idiots that never do anything because

6680.4 --> 6686.719
otherwise they'd have to like write a

6683.63 --> 6690.119
[Music]

6686.719 --> 6693.52
report I like Indian police officers

6690.119 --> 6695.88
that beat people with sticks I like them

6693.52 --> 6697.8
I want those types of police officers

6695.88 --> 6701.2390000000005
that beat people with

6697.8 --> 6701.2390000000005
sticks I like

6706.719 --> 6711.96
it that's right

6708.96 --> 6711.96
d

6724.84 --> 6729.96
I mean how the hell are you going to

6727.199 --> 6734.199
win against the Marxist Communist

6729.96 --> 6736.32
Revolution finet style if you don't have

6734.199 --> 6738.44
Indian police officers that are willing

6736.32 --> 6740.44
to beat anybody with a stick if they

6738.44 --> 6743.638999999999
don't do what they tell you what you

6740.44 --> 6747.598999999999
tell them I mean you got to have that

6743.639 --> 6747.599
otherwise you could never

6753.8 --> 6758.2390000000005
win Indian police yeah but I'm not

6756.56 --> 6763.320000000001
talking about the small stick I'm

6758.239 --> 6763.32
talking about those long sticks they're

6763.679 --> 6768.84
like that that's the type of police I'm

6767.56 --> 6772.84
talking

6768.84 --> 6772.84
about with the long

6779.88 --> 6785.639
sticks I'm not talking about beating

6782.4 --> 6788.44
people with clubs that just the long

6785.639 --> 6790.679
sticks that don't really damage you they

6788.44 --> 6790.678999999999
just

6790.92 --> 6798.76
hurt it's kind of like a whip but it's a

6795.159 --> 6801.799999999999
stick for protest right

6798.76 --> 6804.719
right I think they should probably use

6801.8 --> 6804.719
for more than just

6817.36 --> 6821.48
protests but thanks I didn't know

6828.52 --> 6832.599
that I just those videos really

6831.0 --> 6835.96
impressed me because they were very

6832.599 --> 6839.0
funny oh and Benjamin even played

6835.96 --> 6841.679
them Indian

6839.0 --> 6845.28
police like hitting people on the hands

6841.679 --> 6845.28
with this with the big

6846.76 --> 6853.0
stick I mean because to us in the west

6849.639 --> 6856.32
that's just like wow that's magical that

6853.0 --> 6858.679
that can still work like that [ __ ] can't

6856.32 --> 6860.4
work here in the Netherlands like people

6858.679 --> 6864.0
go ape [ __ ]

6860.4 --> 6864.0
if the police did anything like

6867.239 --> 6871.119
that yeah that's right you can hit them

6869.76 --> 6874.119000000001
as they run

6871.119 --> 6874.119
away

6888.679 --> 6891.679
exactly

6904.719 --> 6909.4800000000005
right don't the cops over there have

6907.04 --> 6909.48
taser

6910.92 --> 6916.96
guns maybe I don't

6913.56 --> 6916.96
know I'm not

6917.079 --> 6923.96
sure I've never seen a police use

6920.44 --> 6929.36
anything I've never even seen a police

6923.96 --> 6932.8
officer like hit anyone or grab hold of

6929.36 --> 6932.799999999999
any I've never seen them do

6948.599 --> 6951.599
anything

6965.28 --> 6969.639
St going yeah it is brutal it's very

6972.639 --> 6978.52
painful Netherlands is fairly safe and

6975.679 --> 6981.52
peaceful it is super safe and

6978.52 --> 6981.52
peaceful

6982.8 --> 6987.639
because there's also plenty of just

6985.44 --> 6990.28
Dutch guys that just have a natural

6987.639 --> 6992.639
instinct to be like yeah it doesn't

6990.28 --> 6996.04
really matter police whatever like we're

6992.639 --> 6999.04
here to defend my people like

6996.04 --> 7001.44
that's a Dutch thing

6999.04 --> 7002.92
too right you have the Dutch gravers

7001.44 --> 7006.799999999999
that are just

7002.92 --> 7009.84
basically it's all about money and mind

7006.8 --> 7011.360000000001
control Power and media and then there's

7009.84 --> 7014.119000000001
the other Dutch and they're like no

7011.36 --> 7018.5599999999995
we're hyper

7014.119 --> 7018.5599999999995
nationalist like I defend my

7018.599 --> 7026.4400000000005
territory like if you want to enter my

7022.0 --> 7026.44
territory you have to be approved by

7033.599 --> 7040.159000000001
me and that does actually make it very

7038.239 --> 7042.04
safe cuz

7040.159 --> 7043.719
it's like you just don't go [ __ ]

7042.04 --> 7046.8
around in the Netherlands because we're

7043.719 --> 7049.4
going to get you

7046.8 --> 7053.76
eventually right at first you might like

7049.4 --> 7058.5599999999995
hit on some wussies or whatever but we

7053.76 --> 7060.639
don't take kindly to your can if you do

7058.56 --> 7063.84
that

7060.639 --> 7067.679
here and eventually

7063.84 --> 7067.679
like you're going to be

7068.4 --> 7071.4
isolated

7080.8 --> 7085.079000000001
cops have no problem jacking people up

7082.88 --> 7087.52
yeah no they're but the the the cops

7085.079 --> 7091.159
here have so many

7087.52 --> 7096.400000000001
rules like they can't afford to do that

7091.159 --> 7096.4
Dutch cops can like they can't use it do

7096.48 --> 7101.44
anything I like I think I'm not enti

7099.679 --> 7105.28
sure it might be slightly different the

7101.44 --> 7107.96
rules but I think it's even like police

7105.28 --> 7111.48
officers that that have a gun can't even

7107.96 --> 7114.4
fire it unless they are literally being

7111.48 --> 7114.4
shot on

7114.639 --> 7120.28
First on them by the perpetrator that

7117.88 --> 7121.28
has the gun and like even if they knew

7120.28 --> 7123.719
they had a

7121.28 --> 7125.96
gun even if they pointed at it like they

7123.719 --> 7128.0
can't even do anything until one shot

7125.96 --> 7130.119
has been fired at least or I think it's

7128.0 --> 7132.56
something like that not sure but it

7130.119 --> 7134.639
might be already changed around but I

7132.56 --> 7137.56
think it was like that at one point like

7134.639 --> 7139.639
yeah you're not even allowed to fire

7137.56 --> 7142.280000000001
Adam even if they are wielding a gun

7139.639 --> 7146.32
until they fire the shot at

7142.28 --> 7146.32
you it's like

7153.04 --> 7160.5199999999995
okay rules are very strict here for

7157.48 --> 7163.119
police and it's also Troublesome because

7160.52 --> 7165.92
that makes them extremely inflexible of

7163.119 --> 7168.92
dealing with situations

7165.92 --> 7172.679
actually that's the problem is they

7168.92 --> 7176.639
police doesn't have enough freedom to be

7172.679 --> 7179.079
able to actually take care of situations

7176.639 --> 7181.119
properly and functions more like a

7179.079 --> 7182.84
bureaucracy in that sense it's like oh

7181.119 --> 7185.5199999999995
if you're more cops well then they can

7182.84 --> 7186.84
just like wall you in and and like

7185.52 --> 7191.2390000000005
convince

7186.84 --> 7191.2390000000005
you and [ __ ]

7192.639 --> 7200.56
so I think the police in general now

7196.679 --> 7201.679
apply tactical diplomacy a lot more than

7200.56 --> 7204.159000000001
any kind of

7201.679 --> 7206.079
violence in contrast to the United

7204.159 --> 7210.679
States where they seem to do exactly the

7206.079 --> 7210.679
opposite shoot first ask questions

7218.159 --> 7221.159
later

7230.56 --> 7235.52
oh that's

7231.52 --> 7235.52
interesting Le I didn't know

7237.76 --> 7243.360000000001
that is that like

7240.48 --> 7246.678999999999
a

7243.36 --> 7249.92
traditional africanamerican

7246.679 --> 7252.28
thing or is that just Owen Benjamin's

7249.92 --> 7257.119
fault that I now automatically associate

7252.28 --> 7259.84
bike Thief like that I'm not sure is it

7257.119 --> 7263.28
actually about bike

7259.84 --> 7263.28
thieves what are you

7273.639 --> 7281.04
saying it's like my my own Benjamin lore

7277.639 --> 7281.04
is playing up

7289.239 --> 7293.879999999999
yeah ter I know that has happened it's

7298.639 --> 7304.92
terrible I mean it's and it's [ __ ]

7301.32 --> 7308.04
problematic too I mean a lot of American

7304.92 --> 7311.88
police officers like don't deal with it

7308.04 --> 7315.599
correctly like there are really [ __ ]

7311.88 --> 7319.1990000000005
up blacks out

7315.599 --> 7321.119000000001
there like that just like they have no

7319.199 --> 7324.48
respect for human life they don't give a

7321.119 --> 7326.679
[ __ ] they'll just crunk or whatever

7324.48 --> 7329.079
they'll just [ __ ] anybody up because

7326.679 --> 7331.679
they feel like it it's really [ __ ] up

7329.079 --> 7334.079
and those are the ones that the police

7331.679 --> 7335.92
should be [ __ ] brutal to those are

7334.079 --> 7337.28
the ones that you should [ __ ] shoot

7335.92 --> 7339.639
in the

7337.28 --> 7343.239
head for real

7339.639 --> 7346.28
but then instead of that no no the cops

7343.239 --> 7350.0
go after just general black people that

7346.28 --> 7351.92
are really like got bit scared they had

7350.0 --> 7354.52
racist

7351.92 --> 7356.679
stories and they don't want to like be

7354.52 --> 7358.76
violent or anything and then those cops

7356.679 --> 7362.04
just like assume that they're criminals

7358.76 --> 7364.159000000001
and that's so [ __ ] up like that's just

7362.04 --> 7366.119
terrible that that and that's bad for

7364.159 --> 7368.159
them that's bad for the [ __ ] cops

7366.119 --> 7370.28
because they're not getting the right

7368.159 --> 7372.199
ones and they're [ __ ] with the good

7370.28 --> 7374.5599999999995
ones guess what happens when you [ __ ]

7372.199 --> 7376.919999999999
with the good ones it create more bad

7374.56 --> 7380.719
ones you [ __ ]

7376.92 --> 7380.719
[ __ ] yeah that's the

7381.4 --> 7385.4
problem everything every

7385.599 --> 7393.96
time they hurt or kill a good guy or at

7391.119 --> 7396.96
least not somebody that's blatantly

7393.96 --> 7400.88
evil then that creates more

7396.96 --> 7400.88
indoctrinated [ __ ] up Gangster

7401.639 --> 7406.639
people it literally creates them it's so

7409.719 --> 7416.88
stupid cops go after black people is a

7413.04 --> 7420.0
myth sometimes it isn't a myth good work

7416.88 --> 7424.0
going it all depends all

7420.0 --> 7427.88
depends some cops are

7424.0 --> 7430.84
racist and some cops are not

7427.88 --> 7432.84
racist

7430.84 --> 7434.92
I don't think like on average the

7432.84 --> 7437.52
majority of cops are racist but there

7434.92 --> 7440.32
are some that are just they do that and

7437.52 --> 7440.320000000001
they because they

7448.48 --> 7453.959999999999
can yeah would work in guny Bear and

7451.0 --> 7457.28
that is just a statistical

7453.96 --> 7457.28
fact that's

7457.8 --> 7460.8
right

7469.76 --> 7472.92
right but

7474.119 --> 7480.759999999999
yeah black cops yeah that's

7477.44 --> 7484.28
right and [ __ ] gangsters they often

7480.76 --> 7487.1990000000005
go after the black cops too cuz the

7484.28 --> 7490.239
gster scumbags those are like really

7487.199 --> 7495.32
satanic [ __ ]

7490.239 --> 7498.678999999999
and they want the racism they want white

7495.32 --> 7500.799999999999
cops to shoot black people they want

7498.679 --> 7503.52
that they want just hate hate hate

7500.8 --> 7505.559
because all they want is like bring out

7503.52 --> 7507.679
the weapons and just [ __ ] murder

7505.559 --> 7511.52
everybody that's what they secretly

7507.679 --> 7514.159
want those are like Devil possessed

7511.52 --> 7517.159000000001
blacks those are [ __ ] up people they

7514.159 --> 7520.679
are very Marxist often in

7517.159 --> 7520.679
nature and

7529.84 --> 7534.400000000001
yeah those are the ones that you often

7532.32 --> 7536.84
see like oh they've just been released

7534.4 --> 7540.159
again after they just murdered somebody

7536.84 --> 7540.159000000001
released within 24

7540.239 --> 7547.678999999999
hours I don't get how those people are

7545.04 --> 7550.44
alive

7547.679 --> 7553.4800000000005
like everything that's around like how

7550.44 --> 7556.159
how do they not just oh they just seem

7553.48 --> 7558.32
to randomly get shot in an alley or

7556.159 --> 7560.0
something I don't get it like why are

7558.32 --> 7563.239
those [ __ ] people walking around

7560.0 --> 7565.48
after all that how do other people just

7563.239 --> 7568.079
let that walk

7565.48 --> 7570.28
around all the opportunities to do

7568.079 --> 7574.719
something about

7570.28 --> 7576.8
it I mean America really is the land of

7574.719 --> 7579.0
opportunities right you have

7576.8 --> 7581.8
opportunities to do something about

7579.0 --> 7586.639
demonically possessed [ __ ] up people

7581.8 --> 7586.639
that we in Europe don't have all that

7586.92 --> 7592.599
opportunity you can actually do

7589.36 --> 7594.839999999999
something about it here it's much more

7592.599 --> 7597.04
difficult to do something about it much

7594.84 --> 7597.04
more

7607.599 --> 7610.599
tedious

7637.52 --> 7640.52
that

7644.28 --> 7650.44
right but I mean look those [ __ ]

7647.679 --> 7653.32
gangsters a lot of those retards are

7650.44 --> 7655.079
like you know that they are so [ __ ]

7653.32 --> 7658.04
full of themselves that they actually

7655.079 --> 7660.0
feel themselves of as Martyrs against

7658.04 --> 7663.96
the

7660.0 --> 7667.52
police it's like oh he got shot oh he's

7663.96 --> 7671.599
a martyr now for our calls against the

7667.52 --> 7674.040000000001
police with our Utopia where there's no

7671.599 --> 7677.079
more government and police so that you

7674.04 --> 7680.159
can be the top G that can just steal and

7677.079 --> 7682.159
rape and murder and everybody worships

7680.159 --> 7684.92
you for it like that's

7682.159 --> 7687.159
their that's their their Holy Kingdom

7684.92 --> 7689.079
that they're fighting for and if

7687.159 --> 7693.679
somebody gets shot by the cops well then

7689.079 --> 7697.199
they're just a Marty Marty to them cuz

7693.679 --> 7697.1990000000005
those people are [ __ ] up and

7697.44 --> 7700.44
insane

7707.04 --> 7713.199
they're

7709.0 --> 7716.639
like like jungle Warlords that are just

7713.199 --> 7720.839999999999
nestling themselves into weaker parts of

7716.639 --> 7724.76
Western society and they are there to

7720.84 --> 7728.559
replace Western Society like they don't

7724.76 --> 7732.119000000001
give a [ __ ] about any order or

7728.559 --> 7736.679
production or transport or

7732.119 --> 7736.679
availability those people those gangster

7737.559 --> 7742.360000000001
[ __ ] they don't care about any of

7744.4 --> 7749.32
that they just want to be on top of

7747.48 --> 7752.919999999999
whatever is

7749.32 --> 7755.558999999999
left and they don't care if it runs out

7752.92 --> 7757.32
permanently as long as they're on top I

7755.559 --> 7760.320000000001
don't

7757.32 --> 7760.32
care

7763.119 --> 7769.96
because they have no vested interests

7766.48 --> 7772.199
spiritual or otherwise in the

7769.96 --> 7774.88
consistence of Western

7772.199 --> 7778.079
Society they have no investment in that

7774.88 --> 7780.28
they're not going to grow towards any of

7778.079 --> 7782.28
that they're not like oh they're just

7780.28 --> 7785.159
still young and they still have to like

7782.28 --> 7787.32
get through things get no no

7785.159 --> 7790.799999999999
no they don't

7787.32 --> 7793.159
care and they don't want to care and

7790.8 --> 7795.719
they're just having their

7793.159 --> 7798.759999999999
own alternative

7795.719 --> 7801.96
vision for how things work and in that

7798.76 --> 7805.159000000001
Vision everything keeps breaking down

7801.96 --> 7808.76
more and more until there's nothing

7805.159 --> 7808.759999999999
left and they don't

7815.599 --> 7820.400000000001
care right and that's that's the Marxist

7818.4 --> 7823.558999999999
demon that's the

7820.4 --> 7825.879999999999
demon power no matter the cost even if

7823.559 --> 7828.1990000000005
that means you lose

7825.88 --> 7831.04
everything it's what

7828.199 --> 7832.32
defines on a spiritual level esoterical

7831.04 --> 7835.599
it's what

7832.32 --> 7839.48
defines the Marxist

7835.599 --> 7842.96
demon you sacrifice

7839.48 --> 7846.0
everything to get power even if that

7842.96 --> 7846.0
means you have nothing

7847.239 --> 7852.959999999999
left it's the ultimate

7850.76 --> 7856.280000000001
autocracy the

7852.96 --> 7859.96
ultimate power hungry

7856.28 --> 7863.8
move it's also known as selling your

7859.96 --> 7863.8
soul there's no way

7866.719 --> 7870.2390000000005
back that's what they

7871.0 --> 7878.719
do it is Marxist That's What I Call

7875.079 --> 7881.679
Marxist this the relentless

7878.719 --> 7885.639
sacrifice of any

7881.679 --> 7887.2390000000005
normaly or social

7885.639 --> 7891.92
loyalty

7887.239 --> 7895.44
towards others in yeah in trade of like

7891.92 --> 7898.28
the ultimate power and mind control over

7895.44 --> 7902.44
everybody that you collectively share

7898.28 --> 7904.84
with those that partake in using that

7902.44 --> 7907.32
power as

7904.84 --> 7910.1990000000005
well but I mean it's just a loose

7907.32 --> 7913.558999999999
Alliance like like marxists are Loosely

7910.199 --> 7914.759999999999
allied with each other and hey if they

7913.559 --> 7918.400000000001
could

7914.76 --> 7921.04
like take the power of their colleague

7918.4 --> 7922.719
Marxist they'd [ __ ] murder them no

7921.04 --> 7927.559
problem they don't give a

7922.719 --> 7932.2390000000005
[ __ ] they don't care at all about each

7927.559 --> 7935.159000000001
other they only share the power to

7932.239 --> 7938.879999999999
uphold the power and pursue the power

7935.159 --> 7942.199
together they're only team up against

7938.88 --> 7944.8
those that oppose the

7942.199 --> 7947.04
power but they'll take each other's

7944.8 --> 7948.76
lives and each other's power no problem

7947.04 --> 7951.4
they don't

7948.76 --> 7954.4800000000005
care they don't care

7951.4 --> 7957.92
if they take the power of

7954.48 --> 7957.919999999999
another they don't

7967.04 --> 7970.04
care

7972.44 --> 7978.759999999999
many demonic Le says taken out by go

7975.28 --> 7982.32
yeah law-abiding gun owners that's

7978.76 --> 7982.320000000001
right and that's

7983.639 --> 7990.2390000000005
great and I know that those law-abiding

7986.44 --> 7992.919999999999
gun owners don't get

7990.239 --> 7995.48
nightmares they're not punished by God

7992.92 --> 7997.599
with nightmares for their

7995.48 --> 7999.959999999999
actions which means they're doing the

7997.599 --> 7999.96
right thing

8011.44 --> 8015.919999999999
I mean some might get like

8012.84 --> 8021.679
post-traumatic stress from

8015.92 --> 8024.079
it but their conscious state will not be

8021.679 --> 8026.2390000000005
polluted because they haven't committed

8024.079 --> 8028.199
evil they just they might have been

8026.239 --> 8030.959999999999
shocked by those actions but but they

8028.199 --> 8032.119
haven't committed evil so they will be

8030.96 --> 8034.599
able to

8032.119 --> 8036.598999999999
sleep they might have fear issues but

8034.599 --> 8039.28
they will be able to eventually get

8036.599 --> 8040.88
overcome that and they will because they

8039.28 --> 8044.5199999999995
did the right

8040.88 --> 8047.28
thing and God knows that because it is

8044.52 --> 8047.280000000001
the right thing to

8049.76 --> 8056.92
do right if people are completely out of

8052.88 --> 8061.679
control they throw off all forms of

8056.92 --> 8065.4
normaly or yeah normal behavior social

8061.679 --> 8067.719
behavior in favor of some shortterm lust

8065.4 --> 8067.719
or

8067.8 --> 8073.4400000000005
power and it becomes

8070.599 --> 8076.1990000000005
apparent that there's victims involved

8073.44 --> 8078.598999999999
because of that yeah then you have to

8076.199 --> 8078.598999999999
stop

8080.119 --> 8088.44
them and God rewards that or rather

8083.679 --> 8090.4800000000005
God allows you to do that without

8088.44 --> 8093.239
punishment and that you you could

8090.48 --> 8095.919999999999
consider that as a reward that you don't

8093.239 --> 8099.239
get punished for something that in

8095.92 --> 8101.52
general would be considered a sin but in

8099.239 --> 8105.119
that specific context it isn't and then

8101.52 --> 8105.119000000001
you don't get punished and that's the

8111.04 --> 8114.84
reward

8112.559 --> 8118.4400000000005
right and it is a

8114.84 --> 8121.400000000001
reward why because doing that does act

8118.44 --> 8124.4
like it is a manifestation of power and

8121.4 --> 8127.44
order that people will give you respect

8124.4 --> 8129.638999999999
for that even if the law goes against

8127.44 --> 8131.759999999999
you and it tries to frame you for it or

8129.639 --> 8133.32
whatever you will get respect for it you

8131.76 --> 8136.079000000001
will

8133.32 --> 8138.079
get that like respect that last you will

8136.079 --> 8141.239
get a good reputation because you did

8138.079 --> 8145.04
that with people that that are right in

8141.239 --> 8148.0
their minds and so that is the actual

8145.04 --> 8151.199
reward you might attain such action

8148.0 --> 8154.4
through a lie or an act or

8151.199 --> 8157.0
something right and then people fall for

8154.4 --> 8158.598999999999
give you that but you still know it's a

8157.0 --> 8161.639
lie and that would then burden you

8158.599 --> 8165.0
negate the the trophy you got out of the

8161.639 --> 8166.96
action but if it all naturally really

8165.0 --> 8169.36
happened Well normally if you kill

8166.96 --> 8170.76
somebody you get punished but because

8169.36 --> 8173.239
you did it for the right reason you

8170.76 --> 8175.76
don't get punished so that's like the

8173.239 --> 8177.28
the reward from God not getting punished

8175.76 --> 8179.320000000001
for something that normally you would

8177.28 --> 8182.559
get punished for because of the the

8179.32 --> 8185.159
reason the situation and you still get

8182.559 --> 8185.159000000001
the bonus

8189.28 --> 8198.08
reputation because people appreciate

8192.359 --> 8198.08
when other people take risk to stop

8198.319 --> 8204.399
evil that makes them feel comfortable

8201.12 --> 8206.519
that makes them feel to have hope it

8204.399 --> 8209.24
reinforces

8206.519 --> 8213.2
the the the part of the conscious that

8209.24 --> 8215.199999999999
like deals with the nation your people

8213.2 --> 8218.389000000001
it it enforces

8215.2 --> 8221.12
that so there is rewards for such a

8218.389 --> 8223.279999999999
[Music]

8221.12 --> 8225.92
thing hope you guys could still follow

8356.439 --> 8359.439
general

8360.559 --> 8366.319
like taking care of their own goes like

8364.04 --> 8370.12
to all lengths pretty

8366.319 --> 8372.599
much it's like protecting their own and

8370.12 --> 8376.519
well if one of them turns out to be a

8372.599 --> 8379.439
[ __ ] vile demonic

8376.519 --> 8380.880000000001
scumbag well then they're taken care of

8379.439 --> 8383.399
as

8380.88 --> 8386.479
well like they're not going to be like

8383.399 --> 8389.16
oh oh let's get the media let's get the

8386.479 --> 8390.24
media oh we got this this rapist guy is

8389.16 --> 8391.56
going to get on the court and

8390.24 --> 8393.56
everybody's going to know about our

8391.56 --> 8396.8
village now for having that rape no no

8393.56 --> 8399.359
no no they don't like that so they just

8396.8 --> 8401.92
take care of him and then suddenly he

8399.359 --> 8404.56
gets an accident in the woods

8401.92 --> 8407.24
yeah and that happens much more often

8404.56 --> 8410.359
than you would realize there's plenty of

8407.24 --> 8413.359
pedos getting caught in the act and such

8410.359 --> 8416.359
and then having an unfortunate accident

8413.359 --> 8419.359
it happens much more than You'

8416.359 --> 8419.359
expect

8428.08 --> 8434.84
so is anybody still

8430.88 --> 8434.839999999998
here anybody wonder

8436.0 --> 8440.52
off I'm G to change this title I mean

8438.64 --> 8443.16
I'm barely even talked about freaking

8440.52 --> 8443.16
light being a

8446.319 --> 8449.319
field

8455.55 --> 8459.08
[Applause]

8456.06 --> 8459.08
[Music]

8476.24 --> 8479.24
that

8506.24 --> 8509.24
is

8515.359 --> 8518.28
okay I'm changing the

8519.96 --> 8524.279999999999
title I'm dropping the light being a

8522.28 --> 8526.399000000001
field I mean it's a cool question it's

8524.28 --> 8529.16
just that it's not been the primary

8526.399 --> 8532.68
subject here so instead I'm calling it

8529.16 --> 8535.84
Indian Riot police with sticks taking

8532.68 --> 8539.84
care of your own I think that's more

8535.84 --> 8539.84
appropriate to like the

8540.28 --> 8547.0
overall

8542.52 --> 8547.0
atmosphere of this show what do you guys

8556.64 --> 8562.68
think let loaded with those what what

8560.0 --> 8565.96
are you talking about Richard

8562.68 --> 8565.960000000001
G what

8566.16 --> 8569.16
videos

8570.28 --> 8575.219000000001
[Music]

8586.28 --> 8592.28
you mean loaded with videos where people

8589.08 --> 8594.64
being taken care of their own yeah

8592.28 --> 8597.640000000001
vigilante justice being all right so

8594.64 --> 8600.358999999999
there's videos of that oh creepy I have

8597.64 --> 8602.319
to say making a video about it that is

8600.359 --> 8605.08
kind of [ __ ] creepy

8602.319 --> 8608.96
though that is kind of

8605.08 --> 8611.68
creepy but okay thanks at least I know

8608.96 --> 8615.919999999998
that that is out there I

8611.68 --> 8619.279
guess right and it has to be to be fair

8615.92 --> 8619.279
it has to be no you're not off

8619.64 --> 8628.439
topic right because if the system the

8624.76 --> 8631.08
government doesn't take care of them

8628.439 --> 8634.2
well they have to be taken care of it it

8631.08 --> 8636.96
just so if the system doesn't then yeah

8634.2 --> 8639.76
then the the the Grassroots will have to

8636.96 --> 8641.56
do it it's going to be

8639.76 --> 8644.439
ugly

8641.56 --> 8647.0
but somebody has to take care of it it's

8644.439 --> 8649.52
like if you know there's just a murderer

8647.0 --> 8651.64
rapist in your village and the police

8649.52 --> 8655.0
isn't stopping

8651.64 --> 8658.88
it like or they got some freaking

8655.0 --> 8662.16
liability Shield or whatever right

8658.88 --> 8664.479
well it's not tolerable to have that

8662.16 --> 8667.8
person just be around and doing that

8664.479 --> 8669.479
continually so then you just have to

8667.8 --> 8672.438999999998
going to have

8669.479 --> 8675.64
to ensure that there's just going to be

8672.439 --> 8676.92
this unfortunate accident then just

8675.64 --> 8678.8
because you

8676.92 --> 8682.6
can't

8678.8 --> 8685.8
have that keep happen you can't have it

8682.6 --> 8689.359
it's not tolerable it's like all the

8685.8 --> 8691.92
mothers that they're just like their

8689.359 --> 8694.439
lives are ruined forever and just

8691.92 --> 8696.52
thinking of their dead kid and and and

8694.439 --> 8699.64
the guy that did it is still living

8696.52 --> 8701.279
there it's just that nobody can that's

8699.64 --> 8704.119999999999
not

8701.279 --> 8707.04
durable you take care of it or people

8704.12 --> 8707.04
are going to kill

8708.0 --> 8715.8
themselves and for some people that's

8710.8 --> 8715.8
not an option they'll take care of

8715.88 --> 8718.88
it

8729.92 --> 8734.56
that's [ __ ] up Richard G Canada is

8732.6 --> 8737.16
really [ __ ] I

8734.56 --> 8739.92
mean they have to do something about

8737.16 --> 8743.8
this government the government is so

8739.92 --> 8748.88
[ __ ] in Canada it is just I can't

8743.8 --> 8748.88
believe how far they've pushed that

8755.319 --> 8758.479
it is almost like

8759.8 --> 8766.039999999999
a it's almost retro in a

8763.279 --> 8768.399000000001
way where it's it's becoming like the

8766.04 --> 8771.6
French like France in the Renaissance

8768.399 --> 8773.8
it's like the way they unroll the rules

8771.6 --> 8775.800000000001
it's like super liberal but it's

8773.8 --> 8778.8
actually super

8775.8 --> 8778.8
autocratic

8781.12 --> 8790.76
so it's just this pretense of being free

8785.56 --> 8790.76
and equal but it actually is exactly the

8805.8 --> 8809.72
opposite

8807.96 --> 8811.64
if you look

8809.72 --> 8814.64
over

8811.64 --> 8814.64
okay

8815.08 --> 8819.88
whatever man it's just raining and

8820.64 --> 8825.72
raining thank God I don't have to get

8822.8 --> 8825.72
out for groceries

8835.72 --> 8838.72
today

8852.72 --> 8857.319
all right anyway going to take a two

8854.12 --> 8857.319000000001
minute break I'll be right

8865.68 --> 8868.68
back

8895.64 --> 8898.64
for

8925.6 --> 8928.6
e

8985.52 --> 8988.52
for

8997.0 --> 8999.52
and I'm

9002.72 --> 9005.72
back

9015.279 --> 9019.279
right right

9017.6 --> 9020.2
anyway hope you guys are enjoying the

9019.279 --> 9024.76
show

9020.2 --> 9024.76
sorry was kind of grouchy at the

9028.399 --> 9033.519999999999
start it's just this freaking weather

9030.84 --> 9033.52
man it's not

9045.439 --> 9048.439
great

9066.72 --> 9074.599999999999
that's weird LG by the way yeah reading

9069.0 --> 9074.6
back to what you said so switch is a

9074.64 --> 9081.119999999999
stick used to go convey that the bike

9077.56 --> 9084.519999999999
will be returned that is just Is that

9081.12 --> 9089.12
real it's called a

9084.52 --> 9092.84
switch really I didn't get that

9089.12 --> 9092.84
earlier never heard of

9105.359 --> 9108.359
that

9115.52 --> 9120.960000000001
right so guys I can round out the show

9118.76 --> 9120.960000000001
you

9123.319 --> 9127.92
know people on multiple occasions not

9126.16 --> 9130.319
saying anything in the chat for five

9127.92 --> 9132.399
minutes and all that it it does make me

9130.319 --> 9135.8
move towards rounding out the

9132.399 --> 9137.0
show you're all okay with that then I

9135.8 --> 9139.8
can just do

9137.0 --> 9141.88
that or I could go on another one and a

9139.8 --> 9145.438999999998
half hour if people

9141.88 --> 9145.438999999998
actually wanted

9165.24 --> 9168.24
that

9193.279 --> 9199.439
to go pick his own switch to get

9196.479 --> 9199.438999999998
discipline oh

9203.479 --> 9208.72
dear where did you get all this

9205.6 --> 9212.6
information IG I've never heard about

9208.72 --> 9214.358999999999
that haing a stick a switch I literally

9212.6 --> 9217.439
it's the first time I'm ever hearing

9214.359 --> 9220.16
about this I mean this is something I'd

9217.439 --> 9222.6
expect to learn from Owen Benjamin to

9220.16 --> 9224.399
expand upon the bike feed Flor and

9222.6 --> 9228.24
because this should be like directly

9224.399 --> 9231.24
evolved in bike Fe the L wouldn't

9228.24 --> 9232.8
it so why am I hearing this from you and

9231.24 --> 9235.199999999999
not from Owen Benjamin I'm kind of

9232.8 --> 9238.679999999998
weirded

9235.2 --> 9241.68
out how is this not said by Owen

9238.68 --> 9246.479000000001
Benjamin before I mean this is like

9241.68 --> 9246.479000000001
intricate lore very relevant for

9255.08 --> 9258.08
him

9272.399 --> 9278.64
you know okay you knew that that's very

9275.6 --> 9281.479000000001
interesting I

9278.64 --> 9283.64
mean I'm I am shocked though that I

9281.479 --> 9285.08
haven't heard Owen Benjamin mention

9283.64 --> 9288.08
anything about

9285.08 --> 9288.08
this

9291.84 --> 9296.16
I guess no black kid ever brought him a

9296.439 --> 9301.880000000001
stick but now I guess I know what that

9298.88 --> 9303.72
means it's like oh my bike got stolen

9301.88 --> 9306.72
and if then somebody shows up with a

9303.72 --> 9309.88
stick that's basically oh that means

9306.72 --> 9312.358999999999
they're going to give the bike back okay

9309.88 --> 9312.358999999999
now I

9315.0 --> 9318.0
know

9326.24 --> 9328.72
what the

9332.16 --> 9336.08
hell what the hell is

9344.96 --> 9347.96
that

9351.34 --> 9360.309
[Music]

9353.08 --> 9360.309
[Applause]

9360.95 --> 9364.009
[Music]

9366.25 --> 9369.389
[Music]

9371.399 --> 9377.92
Eric Deb just posted a very very

9374.56 --> 9377.92
clickbait type

9378.8 --> 9382.08
title the

9391.0 --> 9394.359
[ __ ] that's

9397.64 --> 9402.88
this I just [ __ ] love that when that

9404.88 --> 9410.559
happens

9407.33 --> 9410.559
[Music]

9417.68 --> 9422.92
picking a large switch and or small

9420.24 --> 9425.119999999999
switch of different outut what how does

9422.92 --> 9425.12
that

9434.8 --> 9437.8
work

9484.16 --> 9489.84
right okay so I'm gonna well what's this

9488.64 --> 9493.439
take a look

9489.84 --> 9493.439
around one more

9494.72 --> 9499.56
time and then I'm probably gonna round

9497.2 --> 9499.560000000001
out the

9507.68 --> 9511.03
[Music]

9524.72 --> 9527.72
show

9554.64 --> 9557.64
for

9582.65 --> 9587.64
[Music]

9584.64 --> 9587.64
for

9595.64 --> 9601.399
right I'm just looking

9598.2 --> 9604.6
around checking out if there's any worth

9601.399 --> 9604.599999999999
worthwhile news to

9614.56 --> 9617.56
share

9644.16 --> 9652.0
H yeah I I guess that just still had

9648.439 --> 9654.84
like I didn't I barely had any kind of

9652.0 --> 9654.84
like physical

9656.319 --> 9661.439
punishment I think I like got that once

9659.359 --> 9664.880000000001
as like a really little

9661.439 --> 9664.880000000001
kid one

9665.84 --> 9674.319
time and that's it like after that it

9669.84 --> 9676.880000000001
was all like psychological mostly it was

9674.319 --> 9679.92
just like for to be made aware of what I

9676.88 --> 9680.88
was doing and then self-correct and all

9679.92 --> 9684.479
that

9680.88 --> 9686.92
like my parents like really avoided

9684.479 --> 9686.92
physical

9687.439 --> 9692.359
punishment it did like decently

9701.56 --> 9708.56
effective yeah picking yeah choosing

9704.2 --> 9708.560000000001
your punishment is very tough tough I

9718.88 --> 9726.08
know but I mean look at some point to be

9722.08 --> 9728.359
fair though and for real like if they if

9726.08 --> 9731.479
my parents for whatever reason had kind

9728.359 --> 9734.359
of like done physical punishment I would

9731.479 --> 9735.88
have eventually fled the

9734.359 --> 9738.0
house

9735.88 --> 9742.039999999999
I would I would literally give up

9738.0 --> 9745.92
everything because it's like I have to

9742.04 --> 9748.76
do what I do like I have to do it for my

9745.92 --> 9751.76
self-development to be more I have to do

9748.76 --> 9754.52
these things all these

9751.76 --> 9758.2
things and if I'd be physically

9754.52 --> 9760.2
threatened like that I would eventually

9758.2 --> 9762.960000000001
just say like yeah you can't do this

9760.2 --> 9767.359
anymore or I'm going to run away for

9762.96 --> 9767.358999999999
real and I would have actually done

9769.399 --> 9776.56
that like I would literally then as an

9772.88 --> 9778.199999999999
alternative torture myself in protest

9776.56 --> 9781.519999999999
until there would be no more physical

9778.2 --> 9781.52
punishment that's what would have

9791.319 --> 9798.119999999999
happened I

9794.279 --> 9801.16
think but I don't know I can't really

9798.12 --> 9803.12
size it up properly because that time

9801.16 --> 9805.88
has

9803.12 --> 9808.880000000001
passed it went the way it

9805.88 --> 9810.679999999998
did I can't really imagine what would

9808.88 --> 9812.839999999998
have happened if like the entire

9810.68 --> 9814.52
disciplinary situation for my parents

9812.84 --> 9817.56
would have been completely different I

9814.52 --> 9819.92
just can't imagine it I might have

9817.56 --> 9824.278999999999
become a completely different type of

9819.92 --> 9827.279
person as much less upfront like I am

9824.279 --> 9827.279
now

9835.12 --> 9838.439
you put a book in your

9840.92 --> 9848.56
PS from that day on your punishment

9843.8 --> 9848.56
shifted to yard work and labor

9849.92 --> 9853.8
right yeah that's much more

9854.2 --> 9857.2
effective

9859.319 --> 9863.56
I think my parents did that kind of

9861.24 --> 9868.84
disciplinary action as well they just

9863.56 --> 9868.84
like now we have to clean this or

9875.0 --> 9881.16
that right but for me most of the time

9877.72 --> 9883.08
punishment was basically like you're not

9881.16 --> 9885.84
allowed to do the thing that you like to

9883.08 --> 9887.56
do and that's it so it's like little kid

9885.84 --> 9890.24
like yeah now you don't get to play with

9887.56 --> 9892.76
your Legos which is like mortifying to

9890.24 --> 9896.039999999999
me like oh my God

9892.76 --> 9898.2
you like I would have been less

9896.04 --> 9900.240000000002
horrified if You' literally lock me up

9898.2 --> 9903.12
in a dungeon

9900.24 --> 9906.16
parents then deprive me of Lego it's

9903.12 --> 9906.160000000002
just you can't do

9906.399 --> 9909.399
that

9909.8 --> 9915.479
but it's like

9912.92 --> 9918.68
yeah later it became the computer it's

9915.479 --> 9920.84
like oh yeah you have if you misbehave

9918.68 --> 9923.0
then you can't play on the computer it's

9920.84 --> 9925.8
like

9923.0 --> 9928.439
okay or if sometimes it would still

9925.8 --> 9930.56
happen and be like please what can I do

9928.439 --> 9932.960000000001
like can I do any chores or anything

9930.56 --> 9937.319
just please don't tell me that I can't

9932.96 --> 9940.88
play computer later please like I'll do

9937.319 --> 9944.359
anything like and then they sometimes do

9940.88 --> 9948.08
that it's like okay well if you do this

9944.359 --> 9951.720000000001
and that then you can

9948.08 --> 9953.92
afterward so it was a lot of negotiation

9951.72 --> 9955.399
negotiating I was like a business

9953.92 --> 9958.399
contract

9955.399 --> 9962.24
negotiating like labor versus allowing

9958.399 --> 9962.24
me to just amuse

9963.68 --> 9970.12
myself there are

9966.2 --> 9970.12
no no Devin

9972.56 --> 9977.88
bog yeah what are your thoughts on

9975.319 --> 9977.88
unicorn

9981.68 --> 9987.84
farts yeah what the [ __ ] does any of

9984.24 --> 9987.84
this have to do with what I'm talking

9988.16 --> 9995.2
about

9990.8 --> 9998.16
yeah so tell me Devin B what are your

9995.2 --> 10002.399000000001
thoughts on unicorn thought

9998.16 --> 10005.319
farts tell me in the chat right now cuz

10002.399 --> 10008.72
it's super important to sly out of

10005.319 --> 10008.72
nowhere ask you about

10014.0 --> 10019.439
that it's not like we were talking about

10016.64 --> 10021.319
a subject like discipline parental

10019.439 --> 10022.76
discipline or anything no no no you have

10021.319 --> 10025.96
to bring that

10022.76 --> 10025.960000000001
up of

10026.68 --> 10031.04
course you happen to Believe In

10031.399 --> 10036.92
Unicorns all righty

10033.92 --> 10036.92
then

10060.2 --> 10065.800000000001
right but for me yeah basically the

10062.64 --> 10068.519999999999
discipline eventually it brought out my

10065.8 --> 10071.96
more jewy side and it would just

10068.52 --> 10075.08
negotiate it's like oh how can I

10071.96 --> 10077.8
negotiate the optimum outcome for me

10075.08 --> 10080.84
just being a junkie to playing video

10077.8 --> 10083.24
games or whatever more Saturday morning

10080.84 --> 10089.08

10083.24 --> 10089.08
Legos versus chores that needed to be

10189.68 --> 10193.800000000001
big food could be the missing link with

10204.04 --> 10209.52
what I didn't know link was

10212.479 --> 10218.278999999999
missing I thought he was on a quest to

10215.76 --> 10218.279
save

10219.2 --> 10223.84
Zelda not dress up like

10243.64 --> 10246.64
Bigfoot

10247.439 --> 10252.319
just wanted to know if he's a Believer

10249.279 --> 10254.960000000001
or not well I've talked about it before

10252.319 --> 10259.039999999999
nobody

10254.96 --> 10263.358999999999
cares like I've already shared this with

10259.04 --> 10264.439
people I don't want people to even think

10263.359 --> 10268.439
about

10264.439 --> 10272.479000000001
it anymore yeah because for some people

10268.439 --> 10278.08
big food is just cookie it's just cookie

10272.479 --> 10280.76
soon as you say it it's like oh oh so

10278.08 --> 10285.2
everything he says is [ __ ]

10280.76 --> 10289.800000000001
now okay like some people have with flat

10285.2 --> 10291.960000000001
earth like people have that with Bigfoot

10289.8 --> 10294.96
and other people even had that with

10291.96 --> 10300.919999999998
aliens in the '90s like oh aliens oh

10294.96 --> 10307.199999999999
okay right oh Bigfoot oh okay right so

10300.92 --> 10312.04
I'm not just going to tell you now out

10307.2 --> 10313.960000000001
of nowhere what my position on that is

10312.04 --> 10315.76
in the middle of a completely

10313.96 --> 10317.358999999999
differently themed

10315.76 --> 10322.08
hangout

10317.359 --> 10324.239
yeah I'm going to give you your little

10322.08 --> 10329.439
tag that you

10324.239 --> 10332.359
need to diffuse people's attention to my

10329.439 --> 10336.76
work just not just going to give it to

10332.359 --> 10336.76
you cuz I know what you're

10338.72 --> 10344.92
doing

10341.12 --> 10349.640000000001
yeah and you're not going to graft it

10344.92 --> 10352.16
into the thing that I was talking about

10349.64 --> 10354.84
either it was just a burning question

10352.16 --> 10358.8
yeah well let it burn

10354.84 --> 10358.8
then let it burn in

10363.439 --> 10366.439
hell

10374.91 --> 10378.6
[Music]

10382.399 --> 10388.358999999999
yeah may maybe if you just ask the right

10385.92 --> 10393.2
question

10388.359 --> 10395.359
like what do you think Bigfoot actually

10393.2 --> 10398.319000000001
is right

10395.359 --> 10403.0
now there you have a question that is

10398.319 --> 10403.0
actually somewhat interesting to

10405.04 --> 10411.160000000002
explore not do you believe in Bigfoot Oh

10408.84 --> 10413.12
Oh you mean the standard horeshit

10411.16 --> 10416.96
vacular that's been rolled out about it

10413.12 --> 10420.76
for decades it's being systematically

10416.96 --> 10423.199999999999
exploited by grifters through the system

10420.76 --> 10425.880000000001
yeah yeah yeah how about I don't give

10423.2 --> 10429.0
all of that app absolute propaganda

10425.88 --> 10431.239
horeshit garbage a green light

10429.0 --> 10432.479
unconditionally how about I don't do

10431.239 --> 10435.479
that

10432.479 --> 10435.479
yeah

10451.84 --> 10457.399
yeah now are there any

10455.8 --> 10462.199999999999
seemingly

10457.399 --> 10466.479
hairy humanoids out there that seem to

10462.2 --> 10468.04
be able to phase into and out to of

10466.479 --> 10471.8
physical

10468.04 --> 10471.800000000001
reality yeah well maybe they

10472.319 --> 10478.16
are or there were who knows if they're

10475.84 --> 10478.16
still

10478.359 --> 10482.720000000001
there maybe they all

10481.16 --> 10485.359
died

10482.72 --> 10488.278999999999
maybe all the

10485.359 --> 10492.04
cell phone towers literally disrupted

10488.279 --> 10496.16
their their ability to

10492.04 --> 10497.800000000001
exist phased out and they just died as

10496.16 --> 10502.64
soon as those Towers were activated

10497.8 --> 10505.64
maybe like hundreds of thousands of big

10502.64 --> 10508.479
food people in the world all

10505.64 --> 10510.88
simultaneously died once they turned on

10508.479 --> 10513.84
the radar

10510.88 --> 10516.96
system in the early 20th century maybe

10513.84 --> 10520.2
they literally all simultaneously died

10516.96 --> 10520.199999999999
just Dro Dead all at

10522.16 --> 10525.56
once how do you

10526.8 --> 10531.399
know right and if you're going to find

10529.12 --> 10533.84
some corpse of a humanoid guess what

10531.399 --> 10536.92
you're going to think it's a humanoid

10533.84 --> 10536.92
you're going to think it's a

10538.239 --> 10542.239
human so

10543.2 --> 10546.2
yeah

10546.359 --> 10551.720000000001
