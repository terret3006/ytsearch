65.67 --> 73.259
appreciated so I don't know why but my

69.78 --> 74.91
volume seems to be low for some reason

73.259 --> 77.3
even though the sound settings haven't

74.91 --> 82.08
been changed I don't understand this

77.3 --> 87.09
it's weird hope I'm getting through loud

82.08 --> 93.3
and clear enough it seems a bit low to

87.09 --> 96.54
my - yeah to what I'm used to even

93.3 --> 99.06
though it's still set to +10 decibel

96.54 --> 105.74000000000001
sounds okay okay fine I'll just go with

99.06 --> 109.65
that yeah the weather today is it's okay

105.74 --> 116.39
it's clouded but not not that moist

109.65 --> 116.39
hasn't been raining or anything and yeah

118.13 --> 129.709
nothing special I haven't seen the Sun

120.979 --> 134.18
so far right I got with me today Tamara

129.709 --> 141.5
coffee and tea that's it

134.18 --> 148.12
so let's see it was in chat alright ajm

141.5 --> 148.12
was first secret Asian man second Steve

150.52 --> 157.13000000000002
Mike O'Rourke you go playing an anchor

154.01 --> 160.34
secret Asian man again

157.13 --> 168.73
I think yeah righteous force Amanda

160.34 --> 172.61
young Julia Pavan Pegasus Vegas Sun Rise

168.73 --> 175.09
Records Stefan hey listen yeah good to

172.61 --> 175.09
see you all

190.319 --> 203.33999999999997
yeah calm day didn't go to bed too late

198.629 --> 210.689
now I know I think I had a very good

203.34 --> 212.879
rest this night because I feel very very

210.689 --> 218.549
relaxed this morning well I did have a

212.879 --> 220.39999999999998
really good dinner yesterday so I got

218.549 --> 222.42000000000002
lots of food

220.4 --> 229.709
probably double the amount that I

222.42 --> 233.54899999999998
normally eat I was nice I tried to

229.709 --> 239.09
improvise gado-gado which is basically a

233.549 --> 241.739
lot of vegetables in this case mostly

239.09 --> 245.78
potatoes and cauliflower

241.739 --> 250.769
and some other stuff with that and then

245.78 --> 254.579
peanut sauce or satay sauce and egg

250.769 --> 256.47
baked egg this case and it was just it

254.579 --> 262.71000000000004
was a huge meal and it was really good

256.47 --> 267.78000000000003
and I think I needed that it's something

262.71 --> 270.77
that I normally don't even think of and

267.78 --> 273.69
then I remembered like oh wait I

270.77 --> 275.46
actually have all these very ingredients

273.69 --> 277.38
that would be really good to eat now

275.46 --> 283.459
with this weather

277.38 --> 283.459
[Music]

286.52 --> 289.52
right

295.66 --> 302.84000000000003
yeah also yesterday evening not too late

302.12 --> 308.12
this time

302.84 --> 312.36999999999995
I had a Skype call with em with Adam

308.12 --> 318.17
akin and basically installing the new

312.37 --> 320.33
format for the show and I'm gonna do a

318.17 --> 323.33000000000004
test run with that in the evening just

320.33 --> 325.94
to see there's probably I've already

323.33 --> 331.78999999999996
spotted some issues with it like this is

325.94 --> 334.07
there's a different type of chat system

331.79 --> 339.38
a different output than the YouTube

334.07 --> 342.08
thing itself and it's not relaying all

339.38 --> 344.45
the symbols that's what I've spotted so

342.08 --> 347.18
far but other than that yeah Adam

344.45 --> 349.96999999999997
managed to get together a couple of

347.18 --> 352.49
really interested interesting things

349.97 --> 355.13000000000005
does make it feel a little bit gamey but

352.49 --> 359.75
I don't know what we worked out so far

355.13 --> 361.55
as it seems tasteful and I'm gonna try

359.75 --> 364.25
it out so yeah I hope to see you guys

361.55 --> 367.79
again this evening somewhere don't know

364.25 --> 372.56
where it's probably gonna be after

367.79 --> 377.96000000000004
debates somewhere maybe it's somewhere

372.56 --> 378.53000000000003
between six and eight yeah gonna gonna

377.96 --> 383.06
test that

378.53 --> 384.67999999999995
what about whatever and let's see what

383.06 --> 389.33
yeah what you guys think some think

384.68 --> 392.96
about the new format with some options

389.33 --> 395.84
because now it has a sort of animated

392.96 --> 400.65999999999997
background which is yeah it's it's in

395.84 --> 405.73999999999995
the theme but what I really want is a

400.66 --> 412.94
more still like background that would

405.74 --> 416.08
look over an animated landscape I don't

412.94 --> 421.55
know it may be a loop of for example

416.08 --> 424.81899999999996
high quality setting of the game

421.55 --> 426.77000000000004
what's the name again Skyrim just

424.819 --> 429.849
standing somewhere look out looking out

426.77 --> 433.81899999999996
and seeing things being animated

429.849 --> 436.21999999999997
something like that maybe that what's

433.819 --> 438.59000000000003
yeah that I just thought of that that

436.22 --> 441.86
could be funny just gonna find a very

438.59 --> 444.919
picturesque spots I still have the game

441.86 --> 445.55
I could potentially even try to film it

444.919 --> 452.24
myself

445.55 --> 456.8
huh to figure out how the game works

452.24 --> 461.0
again it's been a long time anyway yeah

456.8 --> 463.43
I'm gonna test out the new format this

461.0 --> 467.09
evening but for today it's still going

463.43 --> 470.349
to be the same old same old without a

467.09 --> 470.349
lot of moving things

474.53 --> 477.67999999999995
[Music]

482.9 --> 491.01
[Music]

487.95 --> 494.01
hmm oh yeah

491.01 --> 496.46
hello Brendan cook right away and dock

494.01 --> 496.46
Michael

500.57 --> 506.93
so yeah yesterday got pretty heated

504.31 --> 507.8
seems today things are a little bit more

506.93 --> 514.69
calm

507.8 --> 517.28
hey you Anna Coren laser eyes it's just

514.69 --> 519.32
it doesn't really even seem to matter

517.28 --> 521.419
anymore these days what I talk about

519.32 --> 523.5500000000001
like anything I'll bring forth is gonna

521.419 --> 532.43
be contested somehow by the same group

523.55 --> 535.06
of people and then it's kind of its kind

532.43 --> 537.9799999999999
of surreal to me in a way because like

535.06 --> 540.53
during the show I get like bombarded by

537.98 --> 544.52
all these trolls really trying to meddle

540.53 --> 548.18
with me and sometimes I have a bit

544.52 --> 550.9399999999999
trouble distinguishing and then they

548.18 --> 553.9699999999999
yeah they kind of do take hold and I try

550.94 --> 557.2700000000001
to bend it my way that's what happens

553.97 --> 559.36
usually then but afterward I feel like

557.27 --> 562.85
yeah man I totally screwed that up

559.36 --> 566.0600000000001
because yeah even though I could stand

562.85 --> 570.26
my ground with the arguments it felt

566.06 --> 571.13
like I lost control of the way I wanted

570.26 --> 572.99
things to go

571.13 --> 575.68
but then afterward I just hear

572.99 --> 583.37
compliments from the people that I know

575.68 --> 586.0999999999999
it's really weird yeah so just another

583.37 --> 591.38
one of the reasons why I just go with

586.1 --> 594.35
the principles and stick to that and not

591.38 --> 598.1
to my even to my feelings as to if

594.35 --> 599.9
things are good or bad you know I have

598.1 --> 603.1700000000001
to deal with those feelings on the spot

599.9 --> 608.29
but I'm gonna be letting myself hit I'm

603.17 --> 608.29
gonna be guided by the principles and

609.37 --> 613.18
right so anyway

618.05 --> 624.3389999999999
yeah Crockett family farms Lucas

621.739 --> 624.339
P bear

631.99 --> 644.38
Wow right also have you guys girls kept

639.38 --> 650.78
up to date with the the globe light or

644.38 --> 655.25
that thing's just unbelievable they're

650.78 --> 657.02
just keeping on going and and they seem

655.25 --> 661.76
to be very lucky with their weather as

657.02 --> 664.27
well just I'm really glad you know it's

661.76 --> 664.27
just good

671.53 --> 674.1
what

677.37 --> 685.65
yeah edit or his ace Brandon cook it's

681.87 --> 690.69
very impressive and I also find it just

685.65 --> 693.42
generally impressive how in all these

690.69 --> 696.3000000000001
foreign countries that I know very

693.42 --> 700.02
little about about what goes into the

696.3 --> 702.5999999999999
the people's minds they're like how they

700.02 --> 704.4
respond to whatever is gone whatever

702.6 --> 707.99
there is gonna be subjected and should

704.4 --> 710.64
to just see that everywhere they go

707.99 --> 713.67
somebody there's always gonna be some

710.64 --> 718.68
person they'll find them and that'll be

713.67 --> 724.29
a flat earther and yeah that is just

718.68 --> 728.0699999999999
amazing like it that is something in a

724.29 --> 732.0
way that statistically you should expect

728.07 --> 738.9000000000001
but I didn't expect despite that because

732.0 --> 747.38
I I guess I overestimated the level of

738.9 --> 752.3
fear that that yeah people would be

747.38 --> 752.3
experiencing being subjected to all this

753.02 --> 759.9
so yeah it's just amazing to see all

756.06 --> 764.01
that to see yeah and also some really

759.9 --> 769.8
awesome life discussions with people

764.01 --> 772.17
being curious and stuff there's some

769.8 --> 774.9
really smart people out there that were

772.17 --> 778.26
genuinely even trying to find inquiry

774.9 --> 782.88
into what it is and everything and it

778.26 --> 785.75
was really awesome so yeah it's good

782.88 --> 785.75
good to keep track

786.25 --> 790.97
and they still technically have a long

788.84 --> 794.45
way to go so that could go on for at

790.97 --> 795.08
least another month or so I think so

794.45 --> 797.029
yeah

795.08 --> 798.74
curious to see how that will keep on

797.029 --> 801.17
going

798.74 --> 804.23
the same time the other debates were

801.17 --> 809.81
pretty awesome yesterday especially when

804.23 --> 812.66
the guy or now I maybe sometimes it's

809.81 --> 814.8389999999999
weird with me my memory because I'm

812.66 --> 820.61
doing this like every freaking day

814.839 --> 822.47
sometimes I like after I've had a big

820.61 --> 825.25
part of a flattered debate and whatever

822.47 --> 828.62
I just completely forget about it and

825.25 --> 831.86
the next day I might be reminded somehow

828.62 --> 833.93
but it won't hit hit anything won't

831.86 --> 836.27
remind me of it really it won't come

833.93 --> 838.0699999999999
back to me and then some period after

836.27 --> 840.86
suddenly it all comes back to me and

838.07 --> 842.3900000000001
then I misplace it as like oh this is

840.86 --> 844.79
yesterday but it wasn't actually

842.39 --> 848.87
yesterday was the day before that or two

844.79 --> 851.14
days before that my memory works weird

848.87 --> 851.14
sometimes

853.27 --> 863.27
but anyway vividly remember the Flat

859.07 --> 866.63
Earth debates where the guy came on who

863.27 --> 872.42
was kind of new to Flat Earth and was

866.63 --> 875.78
seeking reaffirmation of the data and

872.42 --> 878.75
wanted to know more details and it had a

875.78 --> 880.67
few good moments with that and the

878.75 --> 883.01
opposition tried to rump is over me and

880.67 --> 885.6999999999999
all that but didn't really matter and I

883.01 --> 889.73
managed to explain relative density

885.7 --> 891.98
really not in the nice way I thought it

889.73 --> 895.01
was probably good enough to just take

891.98 --> 897.28
that as a snippet I should probably find

895.01 --> 897.28
it

899.93 --> 907.1099999999999
it's just that finding pieces of things

904.5 --> 911.16
that I've said and then making them into

907.11 --> 913.26
sound bites is something that I don't

911.16 --> 917.85
really like doing because I don't really

913.26 --> 919.59
like hearing my voice a lot it's maybe

917.85 --> 924.48
I'm just being necessarily difficult

919.59 --> 931.3100000000001
with myself but yeah it was it was good

924.48 --> 934.94
that to do that also because of just the

931.31 --> 937.29
when there's real open energy that's

934.94 --> 942.12
that is really open to the

937.29 --> 946.17
transformation - yeah - building the

942.12 --> 948.66
more complex things let things older

946.17 --> 951.4499999999999
things change in its view in order to

948.66 --> 954.39
establish the new that openness that

951.45 --> 956.4000000000001
energy release is palpable in such

954.39 --> 959.52
moments and that is one of the things

956.4 --> 962.0699999999999
that really when that situation happens

959.52 --> 965.4
something special triggers with me and

962.07 --> 968.82
you might have noticed that when that

965.4 --> 972.0
happens it's almost like magic arrives

968.82 --> 974.6700000000001
for me because suddenly because of that

972.0 --> 976.8
openness it seems like my explanation

974.67 --> 980.91
skills the condensity

976.8 --> 984.3
the the condenses the density of my

980.91 --> 986.8199999999999
energy frequency what I can do with my

984.3 --> 990.66
mind subtly sharpens much much better

986.82 --> 992.5500000000001
than in a more conflicting situation

990.66 --> 994.11
even though in conflicting situations

992.55 --> 998.1899999999999
I've practice it so much that it can

994.11 --> 1000.25
still uphold quite high levels when the

998.19 --> 1004.99
energy is all there is actually open for

1000.25 --> 1011.51
transformation then suddenly I just get

1004.99 --> 1014.51
more capability to wield language and

1011.51 --> 1018.1
inside and all that it's just it's great

1014.51 --> 1023.26
when that happens it's a delight today

1018.1 --> 1023.26
to be a part of such moments anyway

1024.639 --> 1032.809
yes on the debates I'm doing generally

1027.769 --> 1037.3990000000001
okay I think sometimes it's kind of

1032.809 --> 1039.799
tough to get in between get a usual

1037.399 --> 1043.1299999999999
angry moments from Nathan when they

1039.799 --> 1045.319
interrupt in the wrong moments and you

1043.13 --> 1054.409
know sometimes it isn't really bad

1045.319 --> 1057.34
timing from my part it's almost it's

1054.409 --> 1061.6390000000001
kind of a stubbornness it's like I don't

1057.34 --> 1063.889
really like yeah the energy type or the

1061.639 --> 1066.769
flow or whatever so I try to kind of

1063.889 --> 1071.57
break it in order to force a quick

1066.769 --> 1074.659
transit into a better a better set up

1071.57 --> 1078.559
where everyone can utilize a little bit

1074.659 --> 1080.69
more create creative energy and yeah

1078.559 --> 1083.809
Nathan doesn't like it when I break the

1080.69 --> 1085.3700000000001
energy setup of what he does so he of

1083.809 --> 1090.62
course it's gonna get very pissed off

1085.37 --> 1092.9289999999999
but I kind of it's not really an

1090.62 --> 1096.11
accident what I do it it's just that my

1092.929 --> 1098.8400000000001
intuition kind of does it because I want

1096.11 --> 1100.9699999999998
a more creative conversation in general

1098.84 --> 1102.9399999999998
that's what I always want well that's

1100.97 --> 1113.57
not always what the show is about so

1102.94 --> 1118.25
that's what happens yeah and also I kind

1113.57 --> 1121.9399999999998
of also do it because practically if you

1118.25 --> 1125.21
let that Inquisition type feel that

1121.94 --> 1128.72
energy of just cracking their cognitive

1125.21 --> 1130.6100000000001
dissonance if you let that linger on for

1128.72 --> 1132.559
too long and everybody is going to be so

1130.61 --> 1134.5089999999998
triggered there's not going to be any

1132.559 --> 1136.7
type of normal conversation anymore

1134.509 --> 1140.8700000000001
after that between the parties it's

1136.7 --> 1142.49
going to be very very rare that's also

1140.87 --> 1144.379
why I tend to interrupt with that

1142.49 --> 1147.049
because I would just want to have some

1144.379 --> 1150.4289999999999
more the constructive conversation

1147.049 --> 1153.6689999999999
before they all get smashing or just

1150.429 --> 1153.669
stumbling around

1153.7 --> 1158.79
yeah you know anyway

1162.52 --> 1165.99
[Music]

1178.2 --> 1186.299
yeah Giulio Pepin but yeah you gotta

1181.83 --> 1190.399
realized though that Brenda is among the

1186.299 --> 1190.399
ballers Brenda is one of the most

1190.7 --> 1197.299
possessed you could say the most fun of

1193.919 --> 1200.0700000000002
the most damaged physically

1197.299 --> 1203.989
self-inflicted and that has consequences

1200.07 --> 1207.779
as to the depth of where you will go to

1203.989 --> 1210.559
try to avoid the break of the cognitive

1207.779 --> 1215.009
dissonance so it's not surprising that

1210.559 --> 1218.1
because of that stage is in she will let

1215.009 --> 1225.72
the demon driver actions up to the

1218.1 --> 1228.1789999999999
maximum so in that sense as religious

1225.72 --> 1232.619
fanaticism goes Brenda is one of the

1228.179 --> 1235.049
most fanatical religious globus it's

1232.619 --> 1243.72
taken her this period of the globe has

1235.049 --> 1248.879
taken earth like really deep it's all

1243.72 --> 1255.57
the sacrifices that come with it all the

1248.879 --> 1260.1789999999999
atheist dedications and yeah that

1255.57 --> 1263.279
doesn't with all those decisions as a

1260.179 --> 1267.659
person and the way that she just deals

1263.279 --> 1270.48
with people is not always bad it's just

1267.659 --> 1272.7890000000002
when you start to touch upon subjects

1270.48 --> 1275.929
that I don't know trigger her

1272.789 --> 1280.2
politically or religiously concerning

1275.929 --> 1283.0800000000002
science or the globe yeah then we're

1280.2 --> 1287.1290000000001
gonna see that the dark side free pop

1283.08 --> 1289.59
very blatantly if you try to avoid that

1287.129 --> 1295.83
then yeah she is actually kind of a

1289.59 --> 1299.3799999999999
decent person so it is yeah you could

1295.83 --> 1301.4099999999999
consider a day what is it

1299.38 --> 1301.41
a

1306.58 --> 1319.54
damnit what's it called again so stupid

1317.14 --> 1323.74
when you lose the names of very familiar

1319.54 --> 1325.8999999999999
things that the situation where it's

1323.74 --> 1328.27
that super old classic about the

1325.9 --> 1331.8700000000001
supposed scientist taking the potion and

1328.27 --> 1334.9
then getting a dark alters and alternate

1331.87 --> 1337.09
self height what's the original name of

1334.9 --> 1342.49
the scientist the supposed scientist the

1337.09 --> 1347.8899999999999
chemist Jack Jack Jack oh and hide it

1342.49 --> 1351.1
wasn't that stupid stupid names anyway

1347.89 --> 1353.71
you probably get the picture it's that

1351.1 --> 1356.32
kind of thing it's just the threshold

1353.71 --> 1358.21
and if you pass the threshold suddenly

1356.32 --> 1361.6299999999999
they transform into a completely

1358.21 --> 1367.9
different character yeah Jack Jack Lee

1361.63 --> 1372.3600000000001
and I have Jacquelyn I'd right Jack girl

1367.9 --> 1372.3600000000001
that's right dr. Jack Oh

1373.21 --> 1383.24
thank you so that's mostly how I were

1379.25 --> 1387.76
yeah and added yeah for me I approach it

1383.24 --> 1391.31
as a psychologist because if I didn't

1387.76 --> 1400.6
then I would just avoid her because

1391.31 --> 1403.6399999999999
she's a like if yeah a mess many ways

1400.6 --> 1406.34
and I've it's not unique you know I've

1403.64 --> 1409.13
it bumped into some really messed up

1406.34 --> 1411.77
people like and you wouldn't tell if you

1409.13 --> 1414.3200000000002
wouldn't be sensitive but just the way

1411.77 --> 1416.51
they act the way they what they're

1414.32 --> 1419.51
keeping in and I sense that [ __ ] and

1416.51 --> 1422.36
there's some messed up people yeah not

1419.51 --> 1425.89
not sparingly so as one would hope

1422.36 --> 1425.8899999999999
there's more people than you think

1432.549 --> 1438.5
anyway

1434.18 --> 1440.8700000000001
[Music]

1438.5 --> 1445.34
right it's it's all about common decency

1440.87 --> 1449.75
and and the way how consistent you are

1445.34 --> 1451.1589999999999
in your principles and behaviors and and

1449.75 --> 1456.86
all that that's really what it comes

1451.159 --> 1462.0100000000002
down to that's the baseline and if you

1456.86 --> 1462.01
lack control well then that's a sign

1468.03 --> 1471.19
[Music]

1473.28 --> 1479.67
but yet despite all this like in moments

1477.34 --> 1482.47
when brenda is not super triggered

1479.67 --> 1484.63
acutely by being slapped around by

1482.47 --> 1488.68
nathan for example or some other video

1484.63 --> 1491.41
or riley or whatever randy then in combo

1488.68 --> 1491.68
moments i definitely have her on because

1491.41 --> 1496.0900000000001
i

1491.68 --> 1500.97
yeah as i said when it's not past that

1496.09 --> 1505.32
threshold you can have quite interesting

1500.97 --> 1505.32
constructive conversations with brenda

1505.59 --> 1510.57
but you gotta approach it carefully i

1513.12 --> 1517.35
don't know if the same goes for the

1515.32 --> 1521.05
other ballers though you know in a way

1517.35 --> 1525.87
they keep each other in the dark so and

1521.05 --> 1529.6599999999999
they they all push each other's buttons

1525.87 --> 1532.1499999999999
to turn each other into soldiers in the

1529.66 --> 1538.78
moment it's weird how have you noticed

1532.15 --> 1542.8600000000001
that they attack us but they also attack

1538.78 --> 1547.12
each other just with just as much vice

1542.86 --> 1549.8799999999999
and they do it too as a peer pressure

1547.12 --> 1554.4099999999999
tactic to trigger that person in their

1549.88 --> 1557.5
ego and become more aggressive or more

1554.41 --> 1564.3700000000001
rigid or more hardcore it's a part of

1557.5 --> 1568.15
the whole religious mechanism it's also

1564.37 --> 1571.3
because once as a global you go past

1568.15 --> 1576.2800000000002
that threshold where you start to attack

1571.3 --> 1579.07
back yeah it's not uncommon that you

1576.28 --> 1581.74
eventually get so attacked that you're

1579.07 --> 1583.96
going to be ejected from the social

1581.74 --> 1584.92
circle and become an outsider it's

1583.96 --> 1588.28
tagging along

1584.92 --> 1590.3200000000002
and there's ballers out there that

1588.28 --> 1593.1
probably can't handle that so they play

1590.32 --> 1593.1
it super safe

1594.36 --> 1599.07
and even within that playing it's super

1597.419 --> 1601.769
safe they're still not safe because

1599.07 --> 1603.9289999999999
there's despite their tactic out of

1601.769 --> 1608.82
control and will still just throw out

1603.929 --> 1611.6100000000001
insane [ __ ] at times making it a mess

1608.82 --> 1613.8799999999999
anyway and then again they're all

1611.61 --> 1618.9289999999999
getting used to doing that it's like

1613.88 --> 1624.63
normalizing idiotic behavior as yeah as

1618.929 --> 1627.0800000000002
a social standing yeah now that's a big

1624.63 --> 1629.6100000000001
problem hmm

1627.08 --> 1631.9399999999998
media isn't exactly helping with that

1629.61 --> 1631.9399999999998
either

1636.34 --> 1642.53
[Music]

1642.9 --> 1649.6100000000001
anyway that's my my analysis on ballers

1650.21 --> 1661.02
yeah thank you Giulio Pavan yeah it was

1653.04 --> 1662.9099999999999
it was cool if anyone feels that's worth

1661.02 --> 1665.31
the rewards you know Europe you're

1662.91 --> 1669.0
always welcome to reward me by donating

1665.31 --> 1675.09
something to my paypal or maybe adding

1669.0 --> 1679.29
to my patreon it all helps you know

1675.09 --> 1681.57
every time I worry about finances and at

1679.29 --> 1687.29
this time it's it's going pretty it's

1681.57 --> 1690.84
it's okay for now but every time that

1687.29 --> 1693.0
eats away at me it really does take away

1690.84 --> 1696.6899999999998
from my momentum at other times I'm not

1693.0 --> 1701.13
trying to blackmail everyone like pay up

1696.69 --> 1709.5
or I'm not gonna perform but technically

1701.13 --> 1712.5300000000002
it does work like that just saying and

1709.5 --> 1715.89
not because I'm enforcing that mechanism

1712.53 --> 1718.53
it just works like that if I'm all fine

1715.89 --> 1722.7800000000002
I'll be more free I'll have more energy

1718.53 --> 1722.78
available to me in the right moment

1723.29 --> 1726.3899999999999
[Music]

1731.12 --> 1734.2199999999998
[Music]

1740.35 --> 1746.3999999999999
mmm

1742.96 --> 1746.4
is hoping for a lunch

1763.7 --> 1769.19
feed the birds

1766.5 --> 1777.07
[Music]

1769.19 --> 1779.6290000000001
I could try to get a little cheeky okay

1777.07 --> 1781.389
but I don't know it's probably not gonna

1779.629 --> 1786.32
work it didn't really work last time

1781.389 --> 1789.4089999999999
let's see what I can do oh god I can't

1786.32 --> 1791.95
get this thing to balance it's gonna be

1789.409 --> 1791.95
a tough one

1795.33 --> 1807.1299999999999
it's not recommendable to balance

1799.17 --> 1812.1000000000001
objects on round surfaces okay yeah let

1807.13 --> 1812.1000000000001
me get something right back

1858.04 --> 1860.6399999999999
okay

1863.36 --> 1872.26
see doesn't give no [ __ ] just patiently

1866.54 --> 1872.26
waiting hello

1960.58 --> 1967.22
see

1963.3 --> 1967.22
that creatures not scared of me

1987.549 --> 1998.3899999999999
didn't seem to get it though it's a Mac

1992.6 --> 2018.9399999999998
by no it's not a magpie it's a crow it's

1998.39 --> 2021.19
a crow with a pigmentation mutation well

2018.94 --> 2023.2
Dave Johnson it's not just my mentality

2021.19 --> 2025.24
although that matters if you get

2023.2 --> 2030.22
overexcited while you do it they pick up

2025.24 --> 2032.919
on it but it's mostly just a reflection

2030.22 --> 2037.63
of what's inside of you with your body

2032.919 --> 2046.419
it really matters like how you compose

2037.63 --> 2049.78
yourself as you do it and also take very

2046.419 --> 2054.339
clear notice of the creature you're

2049.78 --> 2057.099
trying to impose upon basically for

2054.339 --> 2059.619
science and if you respond to those

2057.099 --> 2063.2200000000003
signs they will pick up on you

2059.619 --> 2069.339
responding to their signs and that gives

2063.22 --> 2071.77
them a sense of trust it does it's

2069.339 --> 2073.419
interesting even the other crows are not

2071.77 --> 2075.25
as scared of me anymore it's funny

2073.419 --> 2079.81
although they do maintain their distance

2075.25 --> 2081.78
overall like at least three meters and

2079.81 --> 2087.369
then they're a little bit more jittery I

2081.78 --> 2089.909
click to Balta way yeah but this guy we

2087.369 --> 2089.909
once more

2099.92 --> 2119.09
yeah mr. jingles right anyway yeah I

2114.2 --> 2121.5499999999997
know it's a hobby of mine I used to like

2119.09 --> 2123.53
birds even when I was a little kid but I

2121.55 --> 2126.26
was I was always so disappointed that

2123.53 --> 2129.8900000000003
when I came running up to them that they

2126.26 --> 2133.5800000000004
would play with her and now I've learned

2129.89 --> 2146.6299999999997
so much more about them since since

2133.58 --> 2149.74
those 35 years ago yeah no no mark colic

2146.63 --> 2149.7400000000002
that's terrible

2164.21 --> 2170.93
it's moment a way of the dodo that's

2168.059 --> 2170.9300000000003
hilarious

2176.93 --> 2186.6699999999996
hmm yeah doc Michel they are crows are

2182.69 --> 2192.41
very smart and dynamic Ravens though are

2186.67 --> 2194.9
even smarter but they're very they have

2192.41 --> 2197.0299999999997
a lot of character flaws coming with

2194.9 --> 2201.26
that intelligence just like all

2197.03 --> 2204.9500000000003
intelligent creatures so the Ravens are

2201.26 --> 2214.4900000000002
really quite the characters they're

2204.95 --> 2218.7799999999997
difficult it's tough and almost

2214.49 --> 2222.14
impossible to befriend a raven unless

2218.78 --> 2230.9
you do it in a in a bad way try to mind

2222.14 --> 2233.24
control it cuckoos are the smartest well

2230.9 --> 2237.44
they're cuckoos are definitely one of

2233.24 --> 2242.2
the cheekiest they're this they're Oh

2237.44 --> 2248.11
God yeah they're there they have like

2242.2 --> 2253.37
similar properties as two small Hatter's

2248.11 --> 2255.71
among the bird world so they're fair

2253.37 --> 2256.0
they're crafty let's just say it like

2255.71 --> 2258.62
that

2256.0 --> 2260.57
although craftiness is not overall

2258.62 --> 2263.06
intelligence it just means they're a

2260.57 --> 2269.05
little bit more artistic with what they

2263.06 --> 2277.2799999999997
do true intelligence is improvisation

2269.05 --> 2279.53
dynamics and building insights if you're

2277.28 --> 2281.7200000000003
just very crafty then creatures

2279.53 --> 2284.78
creatures that have craftiness can just

2281.72 --> 2288.2
be very precise with their theatrics and

2284.78 --> 2290.6200000000003
everything that's a different type of

2288.2 --> 2290.62
skill

2291.08 --> 2297.97
and it doesn't automatically make them

2293.45 --> 2297.97
super smart makes them crafty though

2313.069 --> 2325.959
hmm anyway yeah birds we patiently

2323.209 --> 2325.959
waiting

2330.49 --> 2337.2999999999997
I think it's just being very efficient

2333.88 --> 2339.67
in multitasking because sometimes the

2337.3 --> 2342.04
crows and other crows they just sit on

2339.67 --> 2346.33
the rooftop and I think they're just

2342.04 --> 2350.17
trying to take in the smell of what's

2346.33 --> 2352.18
blowing past I think it's doing that and

2350.17 --> 2355.78
at the same time hoping by standing

2352.18 --> 2359.68
relatively close to me that it might

2355.78 --> 2363.42
score some food at the same time so I

2359.68 --> 2363.4199999999996
think it's just being very efficient

2378.87 --> 2387.98
yeah students at lunch and take their

2383.19 --> 2387.98
sandwich right

2396.099 --> 2400.559
indeed imitating other bird voices

2407.22 --> 2411.8999999999996
but yeah but that's the thing if you're

2409.829 --> 2415.65
if if a bird is very good at imitating

2411.9 --> 2418.53
other birds or sounds that's craftiness

2415.65 --> 2428.089
that's not necessarily intelligence like

2418.53 --> 2428.0890000000004
even what they called let me find

2438.94 --> 2446.7000000000003
okay a black bird right black birds have

2444.039 --> 2449.65
amazing vocal capabilities and

2446.7 --> 2452.799
especially the males they yeah they have

2449.65 --> 2455.619
those vocal capabilities the females are

2452.799 --> 2458.41
usually just making a lot of noise

2455.619 --> 2461.109
trying to hide from people that's just I

2458.41 --> 2464.74
don't know that's just female black

2461.109 --> 2468.16
birds do it's weird but the male's when

2464.74 --> 2471.1899999999996
they start singing they take over very

2468.16 --> 2474.339
elaborate sound patterns and can be all

2471.19 --> 2479.619
kinds of things that they pick up even

2474.339 --> 2485.0789999999997
mobile mobile phone rings or other type

2479.619 --> 2487.75
of birds and and they can do it very

2485.079 --> 2490.3900000000003
precisely sometimes like we in a weird

2487.75 --> 2494.559
way almost parrot like but yeah those

2490.39 --> 2497.92
creatures are not really smart they're

2494.559 --> 2499.78
pretty basic birds so it's just another

2497.92 --> 2501.809
example for creature with a lot of

2499.78 --> 2504.809
craftiness but doesn't make them

2501.809 --> 2504.809
intelligent

2510.65 --> 2517.9990000000003
all right yeah Tony Tony okay hi I again

2514.519 --> 2521.779
with your copy/paste messaging that you

2517.999 --> 2524.66
persist on putting everywhere I go when

2521.779 --> 2527.329
you feel like it right so when are you

2524.66 --> 2531.499
gonna provide the evidence for your

2527.329 --> 2535.789
claim of a moon signal rebound

2531.499 --> 2537.499
phenomenon I would like to see you

2535.789 --> 2541.0690000000004
provide the evidence for your claim

2537.499 --> 2544.819
concerning that and whatever I do is my

2541.069 --> 2550.009
own business really so if you please

2544.819 --> 2555.769
toady please provide the evidence for

2550.009 --> 2558.0190000000002
your claim thank you yeah Tony that's

2555.769 --> 2560.9599999999996
projection you are the one putting you

2558.019 --> 2564.68
at fear in the ears fingers in your ears

2560.96 --> 2566.839
here and not realizing that you're the

2564.68 --> 2568.8489999999997
one making the claim of a phenomena and

2566.839 --> 2571.97
refusing to provide evidence for it

2568.849 --> 2576.529
other than hearsay and trying to peer

2571.97 --> 2579.6189999999997
pressure people making the inquiry to

2576.529 --> 2581.66
get the evidence for your claim that

2579.619 --> 2584.4500000000003
should be provided by the one making the

2581.66 --> 2586.5789999999997
claim which is you and then you're

2584.45 --> 2590.3289999999997
trying to peer pressure them into doing

2586.579 --> 2592.9100000000003
it for you well no you're the one making

2590.329 --> 2596.7200000000003
the claim so you provide the evidence as

2592.91 --> 2599.0589999999997
I described I made a special episode in

2596.72 --> 2602.0589999999997
the flood of the early bird show not too

2599.059 --> 2604.369
long ago about it so why don't you go

2602.059 --> 2607.2200000000003
and do that and stop trolling me with

2604.369 --> 2610.6400000000003
your copy/paste messages where you

2607.22 --> 2613.73
falsely assume that I have anything to

2610.64 --> 2619.3089999999997
prove I'm not the one making the claim

2613.73 --> 2623.2690000000002
that a moon signal rebounds phenomenon

2619.309 --> 2625.279
is a real thing I'm just asking for the

2623.269 --> 2631.4599999999996
people that claim that to provide the

2625.279 --> 2634.099
evidence yeah I have looked into the

2631.46 --> 2639.41
evidence it didn't it didn't suffice

2634.099 --> 2642.289
I've said pretty logical empirical

2639.41 --> 2643.42
standards for what should be in proper

2642.289 --> 2645.5490000000004
evidence of the

2643.42 --> 2648.88
phenomena I described it in utter detail

2645.549 --> 2651.25
and I haven't come across that yeah you

2648.88 --> 2654.46
in that hangout on Jose's right a long

2651.25 --> 2657.28
time ago you provided or some of you

2654.46 --> 2660.25
provided like two videos in which there

2657.28 --> 2661.9900000000002
was no proof that any kind of device was

2660.25 --> 2664.0
aiming at the moon in the first place

2661.99 --> 2666.7599999999998
there was no sight of it and there was

2664.0 --> 2669.76
nothing very it wasn't aimed away so

2666.76 --> 2672.25
there was just complete lack of evidence

2669.76 --> 2675.7900000000004
in the suppose of examples of evidence

2672.25 --> 2678.79
and I haven't gotten anything since then

2675.79 --> 2681.22
but just a bunch of threats and peer

2678.79 --> 2684.7
pressure whining about that I'm supposed

2681.22 --> 2687.609
to go to some club that's probably gonna

2684.7 --> 2689.47
create a machination set up to

2687.609 --> 2693.5789999999997
supposedly prove this phenomena if you

2689.47 --> 2697.3289999999997
even thought of how you can do that well

2693.579 --> 2700.329
let me tell you if whatever I would be

2697.329 --> 2702.25
doing if I would want to do it because I

2700.329 --> 2704.9500000000003
don't need to because it's not my claim

2702.25 --> 2707.47
that this supposed phenomena is a real

2704.95 --> 2709.39
thing if I ever feel like doing it you

2707.47 --> 2711.0099999999998
know what would be my demand for

2709.39 --> 2715.2599999999998
whatever they're gonna be presenting to

2711.01 --> 2718.4100000000003
me is okay that's really nice now

2715.26 --> 2721.9900000000002
unscrew this mechanism from the ground

2718.41 --> 2724.839
put it on a cart and I'm gonna roll it

2721.99 --> 2728.6189999999997
out I roll it out about a mile away

2724.839 --> 2730.9
outside of any wall or potential

2728.619 --> 2733.359
building they may may be installing this

2730.9 --> 2735.52
thing in to fool me and they're gonna do

2733.359 --> 2737.95
it at what I know is the outside for

2735.52 --> 2739.75
sure gonna use that device and gonna do

2737.95 --> 2741.609
it right there and they're gonna stop me

2739.75 --> 2744.64
and then I know they're gonna be fooling

2741.609 --> 2747.0989999999997
me because that's what they do but

2744.64 --> 2750.16
that's gonna be how it works it's gonna

2747.099 --> 2753.13
it's called confirmation it's making

2750.16 --> 2755.92
sure you're not being tricked it's very

2753.13 --> 2758.04
important when you establish signs very

2755.92 --> 2761.6800000000003
very important if you're going to be

2758.04 --> 2763.93
subjecting yourself to just one setup to

2761.68 --> 2767.5
which you have no oversight and no

2763.93 --> 2770.8799999999997
ability to change anything then yeah

2767.5 --> 2774.04
it's just very little very little value

2770.88 --> 2775.9300000000003
you can even control the location you

2774.04 --> 2777.609
know it shouldn't matter which location

2775.93 --> 2779.89
so there should be no

2777.609 --> 2783.609
problem relocating the device at any

2779.89 --> 2786.249
moment just aiming it slightly different

2783.609 --> 2788.799
you know it's very simple

2786.249 --> 2795.509
so yeah who knows I might actually

2788.799 --> 2801.509
eventually get to it but I don't need to

2795.509 --> 2801.509
because it's not my claim toady

2816.03 --> 2819.73
if you keep on doing what you do each

2818.32 --> 2822.9100000000003
other you're just gonna be stomped on

2819.73 --> 2826.12
over and over again that's not gonna

2822.91 --> 2829.21
change the facts are the facts I'm not

2826.12 --> 2831.88
the one making the claim I'm just asking

2829.21 --> 2835.75
to provide proper evidence for the claim

2831.88 --> 2840.4900000000002
which has very logical but simplistic

2835.75 --> 2843.46
conditions and if you can't abide by

2840.49 --> 2845.8599999999997
that then I will not put my stamp of

2843.46 --> 2847.66
approval on it and if you don't care

2845.86 --> 2850.15
about that well I don't care about that

2847.66 --> 2855.85
either I will just keep on demanding

2850.15 --> 2858.13
evidence that would suffice to prove be

2855.85 --> 2861.25
provided for the claim made by the

2858.13 --> 2865.71
people that make that claim which is you

2861.25 --> 2865.71
and other ballers so

2872.64 --> 2884.3199999999997
yeah I'm not avoiding it because I don't

2880.63 --> 2887.32
have a position bill Thompson thank you

2884.32 --> 2891.04
for trying to put that straw man on me

2887.32 --> 2893.5
okay I'm not avoiding the evidence that

2891.04 --> 2897.43
could potentially did disprove my

2893.5 --> 2899.95
position it's not because I don't have a

2897.43 --> 2904.45
position I already said that I made that

2899.95 --> 2907.72
blatantly obvious that either it's not

2904.45 --> 2909.6699999999996
real or it is real and if it is real I

2907.72 --> 2913.0
would find that absolutely fascinating

2909.67 --> 2914.04
and that's not some I know it's never

2913.0 --> 2918.4
gonna happen

2914.04 --> 2920.14
victory painting that I'm sufficed

2918.4 --> 2923.71
that's never going to be touched no I'm

2920.14 --> 2927.5099999999998
actually very open to the possibility of

2923.71 --> 2930.34
a moon signal rebounds phenomenon I am

2927.51 --> 2933.13
it's just that I haven't seen any

2930.34 --> 2936.48
evidence provided for it by the people

2933.13 --> 2940.3900000000003
that claim it that's the problem

2936.48 --> 2943.15
but I'm very open to the possibility of

2940.39 --> 2946.0
it and I'm actually quite hopeful that

2943.15 --> 2948.2200000000003
it might be real but I'm not going to

2946.0 --> 2952.3
assume that it's real because I haven't

2948.22 --> 2959.77
seen any sufficient evidence provided to

2952.3 --> 2963.9100000000003
back the claim that it is real so thank

2959.77 --> 2968.14
you for that straw man I definitely do

2963.91 --> 2971.5
not have a position concerning whether

2968.14 --> 2975.54
the moon signal rebounds phenomena is

2971.5 --> 2979.0
real or not I just want the evidence

2975.54 --> 2983.05
provided to back the claim of its

2979.0 --> 2987.72
existence through proper experimental

2983.05 --> 2987.7200000000003
setup as I have described in detail

2988.8 --> 2995.5800000000004
see the baller squirm see them squirm

2991.65 --> 2998.55
squirm squirm they can't help it it

2995.58 --> 3001.25
hurts when people speak the actual truth

2998.55 --> 3003.2000000000003
and try to hold them by the standards

3001.25 --> 3006.44
that they claim they have but in reality

3003.2 --> 3025.7599999999998
those it's just a mask it's just a

3006.44 --> 3028.3
safety mask hurts yeah you know what the

3025.76 --> 3031.73
funny thing is doesn't even concern

3028.3 --> 3034.3300000000004
earth being flat or not the actual

3031.73 --> 3038.21
geometry is completely unrelated to a

3034.33 --> 3040.73
moon signal rebounds phenomenon it's

3038.21 --> 3043.04
just an establishment whether there be a

3040.73 --> 3049.13
potential physical nature or other

3043.04 --> 3053.0299999999997
phenomena and other relation to that

3049.13 --> 3055.88
light phenomena in the sky and would be

3053.03 --> 3059.86
fascinated to know more about the nature

3055.88 --> 3063.29
of it because they're so little we have

3059.86 --> 3066.23
that's the issue what we have about the

3063.29 --> 3068.42
heavens we have in detail it's recorded

3066.23 --> 3070.19
it's been anticipated be used history

3068.42 --> 3075.61
has been written the religions have been

3070.19 --> 3079.9700000000003
made around it but as to what it is why

3075.61 --> 3080.84
we have so little that's the hysterical

3079.97 --> 3083.6299999999997
part about it

3080.84 --> 3086.9
so hey any phenomena anything that is

3083.63 --> 3092.6800000000003
ten tangible in in some kind of way it's

3086.9 --> 3096.29
I'll take it you know call it actual

3092.68 --> 3098.48
astronomical interest just I wanna know

3096.29 --> 3100.43
about the phenomena of the lights in the

3098.48 --> 3103.22
sky I'm just not gonna presuppose the

3100.43 --> 3105.89
whole heliocentric universe nonsense

3103.22 --> 3109.7
when I do it but I'm still interested in

3105.89 --> 3112.43
the phenomena in the nature of them so

3109.7 --> 3115.58
any phenomena that would turn out to be

3112.43 --> 3118.16
real would be a blessing because it then

3115.58 --> 3120.92
suddenly I got some stepping-stone to

3118.16 --> 3122.91
work with when trying to figure out what

3120.92 --> 3126.539
the freaking heavens

3122.91 --> 3126.5389999999998
you know what I mean

3135.71 --> 3140.64
well-recognized Stefan Halverson why

3138.6 --> 3143.94
would anyone convince me well maybe to

3140.64 --> 3147.69
get me to shut up in asking for evidence

3143.94 --> 3150.57
that might not be there while people

3147.69 --> 3152.64
still claim it is there and people that

3150.57 --> 3155.73
main potential II know that don't like

3152.64 --> 3158.7
that or people that are frustrated about

3155.73 --> 3161.64
not being able to get it themselves that

3158.7 --> 3165.8689999999997
really do want it want me to shut up so

3161.64 --> 3168.0899999999997
they can get their treat for the thing

3165.869 --> 3171.03
that they believe in they want to see

3168.09 --> 3174.06
the evidence themselves but I don't know

3171.03 --> 3176.76
they they've bumped into obstacles of

3174.06 --> 3181.0499999999997
some kind but there's plenty of reasons

3176.76 --> 3184.619
why the baller should absolutely provide

3181.05 --> 3186.3300000000004
the evidence and and get it real so it's

3184.619 --> 3188.7000000000003
out of the way for effort don't settle

3186.33 --> 3191.31
for some kind of trickery quick setup or

3188.7 --> 3193.23
people that just something looks gadgety

3191.31 --> 3196.859
and it's just like oh man it's look so

3193.23 --> 3198.93
real well you know it's fake when it

3196.859 --> 3204.359
looks so real right no that's just a

3198.93 --> 3207.0899999999997
joke but thing is when you got physics

3204.359 --> 3210.81
when you got physics claims physics

3207.09 --> 3213.78
things related to it into the claim you

3210.81 --> 3216.119
just gotta get it right you gotta get

3213.78 --> 3218.9700000000003
the independent variable going you got

3216.119 --> 3222.69
to change what you do in the setup in

3218.97 --> 3225.45
order to establish whether it is real or

3222.69 --> 3228.6
not that's just part of it and if you

3225.45 --> 3232.3799999999997
want to properly get that evidence then

3228.6 --> 3235.5
make sure it's all filmed and in one

3232.38 --> 3238.25
video shot could be split up in maybe

3235.5 --> 3241.23
four screens whatever to get it

3238.25 --> 3244.53
completely established as real no

3241.23 --> 3248.64
trickery possible or easily figure it

3244.53 --> 3251.1000000000004
out afterward but just cross screening

3248.64 --> 3254.8799999999997
multiple cameras from different angles

3251.1 --> 3257.69
at the same time so you just yeah that

3254.88 --> 3261.48
would be the best and just get it done

3257.69 --> 3264.119
just put that ham radio or radio

3261.48 --> 3267.42
whatever thingy any kind of device that

3264.119 --> 3271.32
could send any kind of signal

3267.42 --> 3273.75
aiming at the moon put a camera parallel

3271.32 --> 3276.57
to the aim of it so you can see it is

3273.75 --> 3279.96
actually pointing at the moon as you

3276.57 --> 3282.96
point it and another camera fixed at the

3279.96 --> 3286.98
screen with the readout of the signal

3282.96 --> 3288.66
bounced back receive thingy sorry that

3286.98 --> 3292.26
then you've pointed away from the moon

3288.66 --> 3294.18
you see if things change if it looks

3292.26 --> 3295.8300000000004
like there's nothing coming through or

3294.18 --> 3299.1
whatever and then you point it at the

3295.83 --> 3300.7799999999997
moon and see if something changed if it

3299.1 --> 3302.88
doesn't right we'll try to point it

3300.78 --> 3305.19
better whatever do whatever you think is

3302.88 --> 3307.59
necessary in order for this changing

3305.19 --> 3309.66
signal to establish hey and if it does

3307.59 --> 3312.8700000000003
really noticeably change and

3309.66 --> 3316.2599999999998
persistently and that's all in camera in

3312.87 --> 3323.67
the in a setup that I just described

3316.26 --> 3327.15
then I'd be enthusiastic and saying wow

3323.67 --> 3331.4700000000003
that looks interesting I want to try to

3327.15 --> 3336.26
recreate that and suddenly you got an

3331.47 --> 3339.4199999999996
experiment that people can repeat and

3336.26 --> 3341.9300000000003
that's actually has an establishing

3339.42 --> 3344.34
factor that's real and not just some

3341.93 --> 3346.9199999999996
yeah that's a mecha nation or some

3344.34 --> 3348.81
trickery to make people believe the

3346.92 --> 3352.4700000000003
story or whatever it's got to be

3348.81 --> 3354.69
properly done not do it and we got

3352.47 --> 3356.97
something we got a phenomena until that

3354.69 --> 3358.65
time I'm not gonna make a claim about it

3356.97 --> 3360.5099999999998
because I'm fine whether it is a

3358.65 --> 3364.08
phenomena or it turns out to be a

3360.51 --> 3369.48
complete myth hoax I'm fine either way I

3364.08 --> 3372.21
have no bias in the outcome of the

3369.48 --> 3376.53
experiment to establish this phenomena

3372.21 --> 3380.73
I'm fine either way so I don't have a

3376.53 --> 3382.32
stake in the claim it's not my claim

3380.73 --> 3386.25
that the phenomena is real I'm fine

3382.32 --> 3389.7000000000003
either way so yeah those making the

3386.25 --> 3392.67
claim would do great for themselves for

3389.7 --> 3395.52
the fact that they make the claim to get

3392.67 --> 3400.049
that proof as I described in detail once

3395.52 --> 3403.5389999999998
again on this show so go go guys

3400.049 --> 3406.18
do it and if you think going to your

3403.539 --> 3409.119
local ham radio Club to get them as a

3406.18 --> 3413.319
demonstration sure go and do that film

3409.119 --> 3414.67
it and take a good look at the region

3413.319 --> 3417.4
while you're at it make sure that

3414.67 --> 3419.619
wherever it's set up you're gonna film

3417.4 --> 3423.67
it and you're gonna walk outside and

3419.619 --> 3427.089
then walk around that region so it could

3423.67 --> 3431.529
get a clear view as to where you're at

3427.089 --> 3436.0589999999997
and then we'll move from there on that's

3431.529 --> 3440.559
fine so go ahead you do something to try

3436.059 --> 3442.96
to find proof for your claims and yeah

3440.559 --> 3444.789
we'll see from there on what happens

3442.96 --> 3446.26
will be better if you just did it

3444.789 --> 3448.0
yourself you know if it's not supposed

3446.26 --> 3451.9
to be that expensive if you got all

3448.0 --> 3456.01
these all this money for expensive

3451.9 --> 3458.9700000000003
equipment constantly it must be that

3456.01 --> 3461.7990000000004
expensive maybe you could like put some

3458.97 --> 3465.22
snobbish expensive baller farm together

3461.799 --> 3469.119
to build that thing and do it yourself

3465.22 --> 3472.18
without the local ham radio club without

3469.119 --> 3475.1800000000003
hiring any special type of locations but

3472.18 --> 3478.0589999999997
just do it in your you don't want put it

3475.18 --> 3482.2
on the freakin on the back of a truck

3478.059 --> 3484.5690000000004
and just drive around with it that would

3482.2 --> 3489.66
be the best that would be ideal if you

3484.569 --> 3494.619
could get it to fit on that so anyway

3489.66 --> 3499.44
it's been interesting and very very full

3494.619 --> 3502.299
of triggered messages very triggered

3499.44 --> 3507.779
very very very triggered

3502.299 --> 3507.779
tody really doesn't like it doesn't

3513.44 --> 3519.9700000000003
see you'll even brag about his freakin

3516.44 --> 3524.42
money but still he refuses to actually

3519.97 --> 3526.52
go and provide the evidence which he can

3524.42 --> 3529.46
he admits it that he can right now

3526.52 --> 3532.13
because he has money and still he

3529.46 --> 3534.32
refuses to actually do what is required

3532.13 --> 3538.34
in order to provide the evidence for his

3534.32 --> 3547.2200000000003
claim isn't that just typical isn't that

3538.34 --> 3549.26
just a sign you know there might be flat

3547.22 --> 3551.54
earthers out there that do also have

3549.26 --> 3554.32
money that would just build a freaking

3551.54 --> 3557.27
device like this themselves just to

3554.32 --> 3558.6200000000003
disprove their [ __ ] well I'm not one of

3557.27 --> 3561.47
those people I don't have the money for

3558.62 --> 3567.7
that kind of thing or the technical

3561.47 --> 3570.98
technical ingenuity engineering-wise so

3567.7 --> 3574.5499999999997
but I can definitely point at people

3570.98 --> 3576.47
making claims about a phenomena and then

3574.55 --> 3578.7200000000003
saying look you got to do this and that

3576.47 --> 3582.14
in order to actually provide evidence

3578.72 --> 3587.4199999999996
that the phenomena is real and I love

3582.14 --> 3589.67
doing that it's it's very basic and if

3587.42 --> 3591.41
you just keep on doing it it seems to

3589.67 --> 3594.14
trigger a lot of ballers they'll just

3591.41 --> 3597.83
squirm and twist everything in every

3594.14 --> 3599.9
direction just put up this theater and

3597.83 --> 3601.58
it's like this craftiness again you know

3599.9 --> 3605.15
you don't have to be intelligent to be

3601.58 --> 3608.42
crafty well it seems like ballers have a

3605.15 --> 3610.61
common skill in their craftiness a lot

3608.42 --> 3616.19
of them they all know how to try and

3610.61 --> 3618.86
twist the train of thought of whoever is

3616.19 --> 3620.9900000000002
reading anything into different

3618.86 --> 3623.42
directions they're very theatrical at it

3620.99 --> 3625.1299999999997
very manipulative and it is a skill but

3623.42 --> 3627.52
it's not a sign of intelligence at all

3625.13 --> 3630.94
it's funny how things come together

3627.52 --> 3635.39
subject wise in a hangout now isn't it

3630.94 --> 3640.16
yeah so with that I'm gonna run out the

3635.39 --> 3645.65
show so thanks everyone for coming on

3640.16 --> 3647.299
this flat earth early-bird number 332 if

you'd like to show please don't forget

it is I can't help it at this point I'm

3686.179 --> 3693.619
I'm trying to be crafty myself as - I'm

3691.219 --> 3696.9790000000003

3703.909 --> 3710.119
special episode number Flat Earth

3706.339 --> 3712.479
early-bird number 333 and it's probably

3710.119 --> 3716.839
going to be in a special format let's

3712.479 --> 3718.2189999999996
