2.27 --> 9.719
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.0 --> 20.519
early-bird number 31 I'm your host

9.719 --> 26.64
Arwen and today it's pretty nice it's

20.519 --> 29.098999999999997
not perfect there's some chemtrails

26.64 --> 30.929000000000002
apparently that have happened somewhere

29.099 --> 35.13
really really early in the morning late

30.929 --> 40.25
at night they are starting to form these

35.13 --> 43.47
things but yeah it's not too windy

40.25 --> 50.09
not really rainy so that's pretty nice

43.47 --> 56.39
Sunday for December you all doing chat

50.09 --> 62.42
chocolate saying Sean - Nicholas Lance

56.39 --> 70.71000000000001
Cara CEO now can I see your lead cäcilie

62.42 --> 75.32000000000001
hoof I got it and a J M yeah it's pretty

70.71 --> 75.32
much the one month anniversary now yes

75.35 --> 79.759
so just keeps on going

84.28 --> 91.429
yeah there were some good for

87.799 --> 103.24000000000001
conversations happening yesterday they I

91.429 --> 103.24000000000001
was kind of annoyed in the end it's

104.77 --> 111.49
let's just say the Erik Russian he's a

112.06 --> 122.03
kind of a smooth talking guy and he is

115.28 --> 125.959
cool and he's flexible minded it's

122.03 --> 130.9
reasonable but yeah he tends to go into

125.959 --> 134.959
these spirals where it just gets

130.9 --> 138.079
apparently to me negatively obsessed

134.959 --> 142.459
with things resulting in over

138.079 --> 145.31
generalization and tendencies to me

142.459 --> 147.26
he'll ISM and I don't like that I

145.31 --> 149.989
personally have a strong dislike for

147.26 --> 154.54899999999998
that attitude and it's what I'm fighting

149.989 --> 158.739
against myself and in the world so yeah

154.549 --> 161.329
I find him a little disruptive so Erik

158.739 --> 166.03
probably gonna see this or not I don't

161.329 --> 170.769
know if you can care probably you do but

166.03 --> 170.769
if you're gonna be part of this show I

171.43 --> 181.19
want some attitude adjustments I know

175.4 --> 185.87
your opinions and they're well thought

181.19 --> 191.18
out in the darkness basically yeah

185.87 --> 194.06
you're not stupid but I don't think

191.18 --> 197.389
that's effective it's an effective

194.06 --> 200.48
approach an effective strategy on the

197.389 --> 202.79000000000002
long run and I don't want to engage in

200.48 --> 205.01
it and I don't want to get dragged into

202.79 --> 209.82899999999998
that as well and I don't want to drag my

205.01 --> 209.82899999999998
audience into that so let that be clear

209.95 --> 214.82999999999998
yeah

211.74 --> 221.25
it's I guess a ground rule for this show

214.83 --> 224.04000000000002
part of breakfast no no- spiraling it's

221.25 --> 226.98
very important you know there's

224.04 --> 229.89
something yeah

226.98 --> 231.35999999999999
something that's hurtful or whatever

229.89 --> 234.42
that happened you could share it maybe

231.36 --> 239.25
it's not too gruesome or disgusting or

234.42 --> 243.26999999999998
however they'll adapt it but yeah don't

239.25 --> 245.22
then start negative spiralling just

243.27 --> 247.56
don't start negative spoiling for any

245.22 --> 252.66
good reason there is no good reason to

247.56 --> 257.34
do that oh and it's not just you by the

252.66 --> 262.2
way Eric don't worry it's not there's

257.34 --> 269.09999999999997
more people doing that and I used to do

262.2 --> 276.51
it it's a nasty habit it occupies the

269.1 --> 280.17
mind and provides a false sense of

276.51 --> 287.53999999999996
control it's like it's basically the

280.17 --> 290.94
effect like yeah you admit to yourself

287.54 --> 293.67
the bottom-line truth that it's out of

290.94 --> 298.62
control everything it's all going worst

293.67 --> 300.96000000000004
and that is a false trust as it were

298.62 --> 305.3
it's something you can falsely trust on

300.96 --> 305.29999999999995
it's not a good way to look at the world

306.62 --> 312.93
because if you do that then you're going

309.45 --> 315.15
to be focusing on that instead of seeing

312.93 --> 318.6
and working with and working on and

315.15 --> 321.69
working to spawn the change from that

318.6 --> 324.54
like each individual has their own

321.69 --> 328.8
journey in life to step away from it

324.54 --> 332.61
that's part of the path yeah whether you

328.8 --> 335.06
see it as a personal religion or as just

332.61 --> 335.06
common sense

336.17 --> 345.14000000000004
so yeah me preaching about behavior

341.73 --> 348.72
don't don't get negatively obsessed it

345.14 --> 352.7
it's can be addictive that is and that

348.72 --> 355.41
is a depression element as well so

352.7 --> 357.9
usually people tend to fall into this

355.41 --> 365.33000000000004
kind of behavior a lots on average

357.9 --> 369.35999999999996
during these winter times just happens

365.33 --> 374.13
everybody does but yeah you have to

369.36 --> 377.3
still can't just let that manifest in my

374.13 --> 377.3
opinion I think it's better

392.74 --> 400.06
AJ and and Nicholas are added in chat

396.909 --> 400.06
see ya

411.79 --> 416.49
all right Nicholas it's your birthday

420.569 --> 423.469
hmm

426.919 --> 429.52
right

430.7 --> 432.72999999999996
Oh

434.7 --> 455.02
okay they're having a private

436.69 --> 460.24
conversation my charity yeah to continue

455.02 --> 467.83
on the subject negative spiraling it's

460.24 --> 470.68
not necessary because yeah it is kind of

467.83 --> 473.59
a default position but you can't

470.68 --> 478.96
underestimate the extra dimension on top

473.59 --> 485.44
of it of personal Drive and interaction

478.96 --> 490.2
what you can do to change things that's

485.44 --> 490.2
still possible so I find it much more

490.89 --> 496.74
productive to instead of just

498.75 --> 504.42
seeing things as in tenable to just

502.29 --> 507.93
figure out what is driving them and how

504.42 --> 511.66900000000004
they came into this position and what

507.93 --> 515.28
keeps them there and why and how can you

511.669 --> 519.06
how can it be changed and usually it

515.28 --> 522.0
requires the person itself to of course

519.06 --> 526.5899999999999
allow that to happen but yeah

522.0 --> 528.93
how can you basically get through to a

526.59 --> 531.0500000000001
person like that enough that they can

528.93 --> 537.26
truly feel the weight and take the

531.05 --> 537.26
responsibility to choose the face

537.32 --> 542.69
everything they're hiding from

538.86 --> 549.51
themselves or as much as possible so

542.69 --> 552.75
they can work on it and get out of the

549.51 --> 556.35
negative spiral of some sort or being

552.75 --> 559.76
stuck in a position where where they

556.35 --> 559.76
can't get where they want to go

563.05 --> 565.74
yeah

577.52 --> 583.15
they believe okay AJ asks a question

584.44 --> 593.36
ruin Thorson yeah this is green tea and

588.52 --> 595.34
yeah I always drink that rain show and a

593.36 --> 597.53
lot during the day as well in the winter

595.34 --> 600.64
times not so much in the summer because

597.53 --> 604.9
don't like warm drinks during summer and

600.64 --> 612.4399999999999
AJ asks do you have a belief or faith

604.9 --> 617.51
wow that's so such a simple question it

612.44 --> 621.2600000000001
all depends I think it's a a to narrowed

617.51 --> 627.79
down question to even say that is belief

621.26 --> 627.79
and faith parts of Who I am

627.82 --> 638.3000000000001
yeah yeah look you don't know everything

635.75 --> 642.26
and actually there's so much that we

638.3 --> 644.81
don't really know we just deduce like

642.26 --> 647.99
most of what we know is deduced so we

644.81 --> 650.18
have to trust on a certain belief and

647.99 --> 653.75
then compare these structures of

650.18 --> 659.87
possibilities to see what is most likely

653.75 --> 663.68
and then if you don't rest on a certain

659.87 --> 665.9
trust about something yeah then you're

663.68 --> 666.8299999999999
never going to be able to truly that

665.9 --> 668.6
everything's going to be

666.83 --> 671.0
presuppositional to everything

668.6 --> 675.5600000000001
everything everything so yeah you have

671.0 --> 678.32
to have some faith and belief that some

675.56 --> 682.06
things may actually be as they appear to

678.32 --> 689.0
you otherwise you're in big trouble

682.06 --> 692.7199999999999
as for a religion because they're also

689.0 --> 695.51
often called beliefs or faiths that's

692.72 --> 701.48
different I have a personal religion

695.51 --> 705.53
which it's not so easy to describe it's

701.48 --> 709.649
kind of a spiritual based life ethics

705.53 --> 711.869
code a directive

709.649 --> 719.009
you could call it is that a faith or a

711.869 --> 722.9100000000001
belief it is trusting on spiritual laws

719.009 --> 726.99
as you could call it positive attracting

722.91 --> 730.6189999999999
positive off well what I've learned of

726.99 --> 732.389
the extra dimensional beings from my own

730.619 --> 735.4200000000001
experience although I didn't learn much

732.389 --> 738.66
just experienced a lot and through my

735.42 --> 741.5999999999999
either learned a lot about the Rudolf

738.66 --> 745.649
Steiner approach of the spiritual world

741.6 --> 748.589
and basically giving some kind of

745.649 --> 756.17
identity structure to some of these

748.589 --> 756.1700000000001
entities and it works really well so I

756.559 --> 766.92
trust in that because it was

762.709 --> 771.929
demonstrated to me that it works really

766.92 --> 775.3789999999999
vividly really instantly it's like when

771.929 --> 779.249
I talked to this guy I can't just think

775.379 --> 783.2090000000001
about somebody that they've never heard

779.249 --> 786.6
about never met just have to mention a

783.209 --> 790.0189999999999
name and could be a person that I met

786.6 --> 792.48
just that day and I will have if I've

790.019 --> 794.73
talked with this person and I just as I

792.48 --> 797.8190000000001
do in the debates and with every social

794.73 --> 800.0690000000001
encounter I size them up and then I

797.819 --> 807.389
figure out certain obstacles or problems

800.069 --> 810.8389999999999
or dangers and even as I engage in the

807.389 --> 814.11
wider explanation just like in 1/4 1/5

810.839 --> 815.5490000000001
of it my healer through just listening

814.11 --> 818.339
to me over the phone will already know

815.549 --> 821.249
like yeah your intuition is right or

818.339 --> 823.4390000000001
almost right and just exactly describe

821.249 --> 826.649
the character of the person I'm talking

823.439 --> 835.42
about much better than I can and that's

826.649 --> 838.48
like holy roof over the phone just bang

835.42 --> 842.3199999999999
that exists and it's all part of the

838.48 --> 846.19
path it's all part clarity the clarity

842.32 --> 849.2800000000001
that comes with staying spiritually pure

846.19 --> 851.2900000000001
as it were and you have to really figure

849.28 --> 861.4
out what that means to you because

851.29 --> 865.51
purity is also partially it's also a

861.4 --> 867.61
social element purity because yeah is

865.51 --> 870.04
something technically pure or not it all

867.61 --> 873.79
depends on what the effect will be on

870.04 --> 877.3
yourself and the people involved and on

873.79 --> 880.93
the people that witness it or hear about

877.3 --> 882.55
it yes so complicated everybody has

880.93 --> 885.52
their own judgment doesn't necessarily

882.55 --> 890.4599999999999
need to be right but the response often

885.52 --> 890.46
is the indicator that there is something

896.41 --> 903.06
not necessarily talking about like

898.75 --> 907.33
purely religiously or scripture based

903.06 --> 909.13
book based motivation that that's a

907.33 --> 911.74
different matter it's like okay you're

909.13 --> 914.89
not doing this by these rules so that

911.74 --> 917.41
I'm talking about personal responses and

914.89 --> 921.28
personal attitude changes toward certain

917.41 --> 924.06
things that somebody could do and

921.28 --> 927.6999999999999
there's all kinds of levels to this

924.06 --> 931.9
that's logical like if you socially

927.7 --> 934.21
misbehave that is kind of like a sin the

931.9 --> 936.55
sin word is of course very little

934.21 --> 938.74
religiously tainted to many people but

936.55 --> 941.14
you can it's like a little negative and

938.74 --> 943.45
it doesn't have to be too bad and a lot

941.14 --> 946.93
of people can tolerate it but if you get

943.45 --> 949.8100000000001
too bad then yeah that toleration a lot

946.93 --> 952.42
of more people will cut off so and if

949.81 --> 955.38
you don't do it a no then even the more

952.42 --> 961.12
sensitive people will be very

955.38 --> 965.47
comfortable and that's just one little

961.12 --> 967.39
social interaction thing it all has

965.47 --> 973.27
influence everything is influenced

967.39 --> 977.31
socially even and as long as people are

973.27 --> 980.0799999999999
basically natural and not completely

977.31 --> 984.01
denaturalized and conditioned in some

980.08 --> 988.33
kind of weird cultish way where they

984.01 --> 992.17
believe obvious false things yeah that

988.33 --> 995.32
must sound so so asinine to to a

992.17 --> 998.9699999999999
religious guru but yeah pretty much

995.32 --> 998.97
everyone else will know what I mean

1011.37 --> 1020.79
but yeah the the better you walk the

1015.24 --> 1022.5600000000001
path the purer you keep yourself the

1020.79 --> 1025.77
more strict a more disciplined you are

1022.56 --> 1028.86
in the regions where it is effective

1025.77 --> 1032.79
because everybody has different things

1028.86 --> 1035.79
to deal with and different approaches

1032.79 --> 1037.86
required for that and they also have to

1035.79 --> 1039.54
overcome very eager to decide it the

1037.86 --> 1040.9499999999998
challenges are different on different

1039.54 --> 1042.75
levels for everyone

1040.95 --> 1045.24
so people may have no trouble at all

1042.75 --> 1047.88
soon as they figure something out others

1045.24 --> 1058.14
may have like huge obstacles and again

1047.88 --> 1059.6100000000001
not hey Jose hey I guess I just got off

1058.14 --> 1061.74
work I got a good news while I was

1059.61 --> 1063.4699999999998

1164.76 --> 1170.76
day yet no no you know it's important

1168.65 --> 1177.69
yeah congratulations

1170.76 --> 1181.64
four puppies so what were you rambling

1177.69 --> 1184.8
about today I was basically preaching

1181.64 --> 1189.0900000000001
but my personal religion and why I do it

1184.8 --> 1193.1299999999999
and by walking the path and staying

1189.09 --> 1196.1399999999999
spiritually pure and how it actually

1193.13 --> 1200.4
that the benefits should not be

1196.14 --> 1203.8500000000001
overlooked or underestimated and gave an

1200.4 --> 1209.5400000000002
example through my healer as to what

1203.85 --> 1213.81
type of powers you could call it he has

1209.54 --> 1217.5
inside powers I have sort of that as

1213.81 --> 1220.71
well little and I still consider myself

1217.5 --> 1222.81
to be experimental but I think I'm done

1220.71 --> 1225.51
pretty good at it it's it's weird to

1222.81 --> 1228.0
talk about it I know people just it's

1225.51 --> 1231.24
part of who I am I guess to most people

1228.0 --> 1234.21
do it just I don't know where figure

1231.24 --> 1237.06
stuff out well my healer does it too but

1234.21 --> 1241.13
he doesn't so incredibly well it it

1237.06 --> 1249.8999999999999
humbles me it's like like it's like

1241.13 --> 1252.8000000000002
everything like a high yeah he's not a

1249.9 --> 1256.8600000000001
holy man or anything needs like pretty

1252.8 --> 1260.52
modest and not like with the weird tone

1256.86 --> 1264.27
he's like a really pretty basic guy but

1260.52 --> 1267.77
in his knowledge of Rudolf Steiner and

1264.27 --> 1271.35
his practical application of it he is

1267.77 --> 1274.2
astoundingly well and he has this skill

1271.35 --> 1277.32
because of it I guess it's you could

1274.2 --> 1279.05
ferry a little bit to Shaolin monks it's

1277.32 --> 1282.4399999999998
just a pure dedication

1279.05 --> 1288.4199999999998
to that path to the principles that

1282.44 --> 1292.3700000000001
allow these amazing things to happen did

1288.42 --> 1295.95
you feel discipline and like real self

1292.37 --> 1299.1
reconstruction in a positive natural way

1295.95 --> 1303.69
that is the critical element to

1299.1 --> 1308.37
achieving it yeah the way I pictured it

1303.69 --> 1310.92
as you were explaining it to me is have

1308.37 --> 1313.32
you watched the movie Doctor Strange the

1310.92 --> 1316.2
marvel movie where he manipulates time

1313.32 --> 1318.0
something like the the show thing one

1316.2 --> 1319.89
whatever her name was like he was the

1318.0 --> 1322.71
teacher you know something like that

1319.89 --> 1324.7700000000002
like holy very knowledgeable and just

1322.71 --> 1330.3600000000001
give you these nuggets of knowledge

1324.77 --> 1333.36
until you yeah yeah that movie was

1330.36 --> 1338.07
awesome up until she started spinning

1333.36 --> 1352.2299999999998
her Globa hologram stuff that was

1338.07 --> 1354.96
annoying you have to do it hey it's a

1352.23 --> 1357.66
movie by Disney they gotta throw the day

1354.96 --> 1363.38
program in there mm-hmm but if you just

1357.66 --> 1366.0900000000001
cut that part out then it is an

1363.38 --> 1368.66
astounding movie oh yeah really good

1366.09 --> 1368.6599999999999
movie yeah

1375.69 --> 1381.13
yeah how many people you got view not

1378.49 --> 1387.04
gonna get that why though unless I find

1381.13 --> 1389.74
some Infiniti stuff yeah right yeah

1387.04 --> 1391.9289999999999
there's the Avengers endgame is the new

1389.74 --> 1394.09
movie the trailer is out for the new

1391.929 --> 1395.47
movie kind of a teaser trailer I'm

1394.09 --> 1399.6399999999999
looking forward for it I'm a fan of the

1395.47 --> 1402.55
Marvel movies why not yeah I appreciate

1399.64 --> 1407.5300000000002
them some of them are really good some

1402.55 --> 1408.04
of them are no okay yeah my favorite is

1407.53 --> 1411.58
I think

1408.04 --> 1415.059
Iram I don't man the first one that was

1411.58 --> 1417.79
such a big impact that was revolutionary

1415.059 --> 1420.16
back then it was excellent

1417.79 --> 1422.71
it's really cute freaking build a robot

1420.16 --> 1425.5
in a freaking cave like with nothing

1422.71 --> 1430.17
just a handful of tools amazing Iron Man

1425.5 --> 1434.679
was like the first movie that was like

1430.17 --> 1437.0500000000002
robotics after the transformers that was

1434.679 --> 1438.7
was not totally freaking annoying in

1437.05 --> 1443.11
just a really good movie it was like the

1438.7 --> 1450.309
first tech no good movie using the new

1443.11 --> 1452.5
CGI yeah I think so yeah also like the

1450.309 --> 1454.3899999999999
new Batman series was also pretty decent

1452.5 --> 1459.61
but yeah the Iron Man really stood out

1454.39 --> 1461.6200000000001
oh yeah they the story is well told in

1459.61 --> 1464.1399999999999
and it's colorful you know and you you

1461.62 --> 1466.36
get to to appreciate the characters in

1464.14 --> 1469.179
the movie yeah they thought it well man

1466.36 --> 1472.4799999999998
they caught us all in the freaking wave

1469.179 --> 1474.6100000000001
of throwing out all those movies and

1472.48 --> 1476.35
we'll just follow and because they we

1474.61 --> 1478.09
are the Chiefs of the Marvel you leave

1476.35 --> 1480.79
her something I love and you know why

1478.09 --> 1481.7099999999998
not I live I'm not demanding anybody by

1480.79 --> 1484.71
watching a minute

1481.71 --> 1490.42
as long as you keep it clear that it's

1484.71 --> 1493.3
fantasy some of this could potentially

1490.42 --> 1496.8700000000001
be possible they're always gonna give

1493.3 --> 1500.35
some kind of stupid globe heliocentric

1496.87 --> 1502.36
based science-fiction technobabble

1500.35 --> 1504.6689999999999
explanation for it instead of something

1502.36 --> 1506.9189999999999
that could actually be viable to make it

1504.669 --> 1508.98
possible they're always gonna do that

1506.919 --> 1508.98
[ __ ]

1509.429 --> 1514.75
yeah yep

1511.5 --> 1515.76
or just saying it's just power of the

1514.75 --> 1519.309
gods

1515.76 --> 1520.809
one explanation they do that too and

1519.309 --> 1528.1789999999999
that's actually I kind of appreciate

1520.809 --> 1528.1789999999999
that instead of like medic clarifying it

1529.32 --> 1534.58
if you know what I mean

1531.66 --> 1536.71
yep true that I just thought about that

1534.58 --> 1540.1599999999999
it was a really good movie I used to

1536.71 --> 1541.3
watch when I was was teenager the gods

1540.16 --> 1544.45
must be crazy

1541.3 --> 1546.34
he was like an African tribe living

1544.45 --> 1548.89
really old school a handful of people

1546.34 --> 1550.4499999999998
black people in the tribe and then some

1548.89 --> 1553.5400000000002
plane went by and they were like whoa

1550.45 --> 1555.429
they they worship in the plane because

1553.54 --> 1559.12
it's a weird thing you know and the guy

1555.429 --> 1560.679
he was drinking a coke a glass jar of

1559.12 --> 1563.29
Coca he threw it out the window

1560.679 --> 1566.19
he felt in the in the food of the one of

1563.29 --> 1570.1599999999999
the one of the tribe members

1566.19 --> 1573.28
sorry for the dogs barking and then he

1570.16 --> 1576.22
grabbed a did a coke jar and he brought

1573.28 --> 1578.32
it to the to his place and everybody was

1576.22 --> 1581.41
looking at it and they find all kinds of

1578.32 --> 1583.6599999999999
uses for it to grind you know to do

1581.41 --> 1585.76
smash stuff and you see a hammer and I

1583.66 --> 1587.74
said smacking [ __ ] and then they start

1585.76 --> 1589.72
firing and one smack one of the little

1587.74 --> 1592.809
kids smack the only one in the head and

1589.72 --> 1599.02
they they they leader you know no no no

1592.809 --> 1600.76
no they spoke like so we're like now in

1599.02 --> 1602.32
subtitles I'm gonna take this jar and

1600.76 --> 1605.11
I'm gonna take it to the end of the

1602.32 --> 1607.1499999999999
world and I'm gonna get rid of it and he

1605.11 --> 1610.09
just strong you know and he then he

1607.15 --> 1612.1000000000001
start his journey leave the place in the

1610.09 --> 1613.6299999999999
mountains in the center of nowhere where

1612.1 --> 1616.12
he lived and then he found the

1613.63 --> 1618.42
civilization and he seemed the things

1616.12 --> 1621.1899999999998
for the first time the cars white people

1618.42 --> 1625.54
technology you know it was made in day I

1621.19 --> 1628.15
think in the eighties yes it's really

1625.54 --> 1634.09
good movie man really a movie are gonna

1628.15 --> 1636.73
have to release it again yeah it was

1634.09 --> 1639.9099999999999
hilarious and a the guy the main actor

1636.73 --> 1641.29
from the tribe he's a good actor man I

1639.91 --> 1644.44
mean he looked like

1641.29 --> 1649.23
if the real deal you know mm-hmm yeah

1644.44 --> 1649.23
well nobody mentioned she watch it back

1650.82 --> 1656.02
yeah one hit me

1652.66 --> 1659.16
it's a he needed to find the end of the

1656.02 --> 1661.78
world so I guess you know in their

1659.16 --> 1663.7
believes you know it was an end you know

1661.78 --> 1665.77
how did they picture the world that he

1663.7 --> 1669.31
had to find the edge you know the end

1665.77 --> 1672.79
any kind of everything together now it's

1669.31 --> 1675.73
like The Hobbit thing it's like behavior

1672.79 --> 1678.75
you know like they just don't wander out

1675.73 --> 1683.38
they just stay there in their region

1678.75 --> 1685.63
they have no drive to go beyond

1683.38 --> 1688.66
apparently there's nothing they need

1685.63 --> 1696.67
outside of their territory and why would

1688.66 --> 1698.44
you go exactly yeah that's it

1696.67 --> 1700.8400000000001
they just live in their in their bubble

1698.44 --> 1702.55
you know with their own people and their

1700.84 --> 1706.27
own they don't try to reach out and

1702.55 --> 1708.43
explore nothing we I mean if not that

1706.27 --> 1715.6299999999999
wishes to be like that but we just are

1708.43 --> 1717.3400000000001
like that because we are right we don't

1715.63 --> 1719.8600000000001
go anywhere even if we want to you know

1717.34 --> 1722.83
but it's it's if something is good then

1719.86 --> 1727.1799999999998
why would you change it you know it's

1722.83 --> 1731.76
how look we have media that constantly

1727.18 --> 1736.03
manipulate us to create unrest and and

1731.76 --> 1737.98
dissatisfaction to push us to demand go

1736.03 --> 1739.45
into a certain direction that kind of

1737.98 --> 1741.19
yeah if you don't have that if you don't

1739.45 --> 1745.75
have media if you just have a family a

1741.19 --> 1748.6000000000001
tribe and just good smart old wise

1745.75 --> 1751.27
elders and nice stories and everybody is

1748.6 --> 1754.6
social with each other then yeah it's

1751.27 --> 1756.94
just gonna stay exactly the same and if

1754.6 --> 1759.01
you admire your elders then when you

1756.94 --> 1762.1200000000001
become elder you will very likely be

1759.01 --> 1765.91
very much like them and so that just

1762.12 --> 1773.11
keeps a certain culture completely the

1765.91 --> 1774.91
same over the ages yeah indeed what did

1773.11 --> 1776.35
I watch was it in your soul

1774.91 --> 1781.3300000000002
I don't know if it was yesterday or the

1776.35 --> 1785.1699999999998
day before and the TV subject was talked

1781.33 --> 1787.4499999999998
about and why was the TV invented and

1785.17 --> 1789.5800000000002
when did they coming when they program

1787.45 --> 1792.01
in what was the intention to create the

1789.58 --> 1794.05
TV and they programs and the news and

1792.01 --> 1796.54
all that I seen I don't know if it was a

1794.05 --> 1798.55
documentary or some kind of hangout a

1796.54 --> 1803.05
show it was really interesting and it

1798.55 --> 1805.51
was all for propaganda oh it was I'm the

1803.05 --> 1807.9099999999999
last the last show that Gianni's them

1805.51 --> 1809.68
did with Yolanda she they were talking

1807.91 --> 1811.5700000000002
about it and in Iran dude she brought

1809.68 --> 1814.69
like for example like he brought the

1811.57 --> 1816.8799999999999
example of the national anthem when they

1814.69 --> 1819.6100000000001
play when they play really fast and then

1816.88 --> 1821.2600000000002
they later start changing and you don't

1819.61 --> 1824.02
realize them when you put it in slow-mo

1821.26 --> 1825.79
he has a subliminal message she behind

1824.02 --> 1830.5
it after the letters change you know

1825.79 --> 1832.09
there are really cool stuff I mean if

1830.5 --> 1835.45
school is scary but that was the

1832.09 --> 1838.48
intention they to throw subliminal

1835.45 --> 1842.17
messages and program us to leave certain

1838.48 --> 1844.69
way obey the government consume you know

1842.17 --> 1847.95
like they they leave movie like the

1844.69 --> 1851.68
Roddy Piper movie something like that

1847.95 --> 1857.14
right but even before the television

1851.68 --> 1859.69
movie theaters it's just all media when

1857.14 --> 1861.96
it really became a public thing when it

1859.69 --> 1866.8300000000002
became industrialized it was always

1861.96 --> 1870.3400000000001
meant to manipulate like even in the

1866.83 --> 1873.21
most early experimental little clips

1870.34 --> 1875.7099999999998
there's always something about it like

1873.21 --> 1877.96
everything is manipulative it was all

1875.71 --> 1884.8600000000001
one giant manipulation scan the entire

1877.96 --> 1888.01
media revolution yeah and I mean it's

1884.86 --> 1891.8799999999999
the social media is basically the

1888.01 --> 1895.69
public's own natural creation to counter

1891.88 --> 1897.8200000000002
it a bit of it yeah I didn't understand

1895.69 --> 1899.5
before when I was a teenager my dad and

1897.82 --> 1901.6599999999999
my mom like I stopped watching those

1899.5 --> 1903.73
cartoons so that movies has to blame in

1901.66 --> 1906.43
our messages like what the hell they say

1903.73 --> 1907.81
yeah you don't you hear the whatever you

1906.43 --> 1908.71
when we went to the church and they were

1907.81 --> 1910.45
talking about

1908.71 --> 1912.6390000000001
when they play the music backward cease

1910.45 --> 1914.019
worshipping Satan and she like that I

1912.639 --> 1915.639
said I'm not listening the music for

1914.019 --> 1917.169
dari schooled the rhythm and I'm just

1915.639 --> 1919.9289999999999
watching the cartoons and the movies I'm

1917.169 --> 1923.1100000000001
doing when the internet came when

1919.929 --> 1926.769
YouTube came up I was a big fan I got a

1923.11 --> 1928.809
big fan in like 2001 big fan of YouTube

1926.769 --> 1932.379
and I started this was my first of my

1928.809 --> 1936.19
researches on subliminal messages and I

1932.379 --> 1938.23
was like actually was my first kind of

1936.19 --> 1939.519
conspiracy that I looked at I looked at

1938.23 --> 1941.23
it as that conspiracy I say it's

1939.519 --> 1943.389
[ __ ] but it makes sense

1941.23 --> 1945.669
because even in Spanish there was a lot

1943.389 --> 1948.49
of subliminal messages in movie sing

1945.669 --> 1952.419
like the clowns clown characters in

1948.49 --> 1954.789
Argentine television and it was a scary

1952.419 --> 1957.1290000000001
guy looking and he had these songs for

1954.789 --> 1960.19
kids and it was all kind of weird

1957.129 --> 1962.35
messages when they flip a on record

1960.19 --> 1964.8600000000001
backwards this weird subliminal

1962.35 --> 1968.11
programming thing how it really works is

1964.86 --> 1972.6589999999999
it works really on subconscious people

1968.11 --> 1975.9989999999998
unconscious people on sleepers because

1972.659 --> 1979.8090000000002
they don't really care and what it does

1975.999 --> 1983.529
is it helps you to take away some of the

1979.809 --> 1986.73
counter response once this thing comes

1983.529 --> 1989.47
to being in the real world because

1986.73 --> 1993.1490000000001
you're already been confronted with it's

1989.47 --> 1997.059
subliminal so it takes away some of the

1993.149 --> 1999.309
outrage for example or it's like yeah

1997.059 --> 2003.36
see they've we've been hearing about

1999.309 --> 2005.82
this all the time it's yeah it's gonna

2003.36 --> 2010.039
take away the spontaneous outrage that

2005.82 --> 2013.049
is also what subliminal and yeah

2010.039 --> 2016.83
mentioning just basically what you're

2013.049 --> 2019.429
going to be doing beforehand that's what

2016.83 --> 2022.1689999999999
that does that's the effect that's the

2019.429 --> 2024.659
effect on the average person it's a

2022.169 --> 2027.99
statistical effect takes away some of

2024.659 --> 2032.1290000000001
those when you do that and if known by

2027.99 --> 2034.619
by the big social media will tell me

2032.129 --> 2036.24
maybe is one day the other is government

2034.619 --> 2038.759
and everything you know about it it's

2036.24 --> 2041.57
basic sociology it's one of the actually

2038.759 --> 2046.6390000000001
the more foundational things

2041.57 --> 2047.4189999999999
discovered and they've been using it

2046.639 --> 2053.71
ever since

2047.419 --> 2058.04
with all media radio television theater

2053.71 --> 2060.02
movies yeah I'm they she had change he

2058.04 --> 2063.29
has evolved he has he bought yeah video

2060.02 --> 2067.04
games I think it has evolved now in the

2063.29 --> 2070.069
point that they don't do it as hidden as

2067.04 --> 2072.349
before as a backward messages or a quick

2070.069 --> 2077.149
flip in the screen they do it in your

2072.349 --> 2079.46
face with the symbolism and they all

2077.149 --> 2081.74
these Illuminati symbols and the one I

2079.46 --> 2085.399
and the pyramids and all these shitty

2081.74 --> 2086.9289999999996
movies the rings of the Masonic rings on

2085.399 --> 2088.7599999999998
the movies all this kind of stuff they

2086.929 --> 2090.4700000000003
just put it in your face

2088.76 --> 2094.659
those are you know those are basically

2090.47 --> 2094.6589999999997
just symbols of the greater plan right

2095.78 --> 2103.0
it's like us each of these symbols is

2098.45 --> 2106.04
basically a description a visual icon a

2103.0 --> 2111.53
basic description of one of the elements

2106.04 --> 2115.3089999999997
of the uniform and as you the eye

2111.53 --> 2116.5690000000004
pyramid the the Rings stands for the

2115.309 --> 2120.8900000000003
regions of the world

2116.569 --> 2124.16
the our world our realm every singer

2120.89 --> 2126.23
that they constantly overuse is always a

2124.16 --> 2127.16
part of that plan that's what it's

2126.23 --> 2130.88
really about

2127.16 --> 2133.46
so it's not necessarily magic it's only

2130.88 --> 2135.829
magic when you don't understand what

2133.46 --> 2137.63
they're trying to achieve they're

2135.829 --> 2140.51
basically telling you the plan like yeah

2137.63 --> 2142.309
I know you love this but and you

2140.51 --> 2144.38
probably don't want to know this so

2142.309 --> 2146.5400000000004
that's why we're just gonna show you and

2144.38 --> 2148.73
not literally tell you and sometimes

2146.54 --> 2152.27
they even do you're gonna just tell you

2148.73 --> 2154.579
what we're part of right there yeah

2152.27 --> 2157.04
through that they all see that you think

2154.579 --> 2159.349
you know that if you eventually end up

2157.04 --> 2161.869
hurting yourself or getting in something

2159.349 --> 2166.48
it's going to be purely your own fault

2161.869 --> 2169.48
because we told you so if factly yeah

2166.48 --> 2169.48
right

2171.21 --> 2177.94
crazy stuff man that's why I just hate

2175.0 --> 2180.21
television so much I watch movies and I

2177.94 --> 2182.5
still watch some shows but I'm just

2180.21 --> 2184.15
amazed by them because they're cool like

2182.5 --> 2187.48
the Carbonaro effect

2184.15 --> 2190.33
some hidden-camera magic TV show so they

2187.48 --> 2191.83
did the do like magic little tricks but

2190.33 --> 2193.54
is in the hidden camera and you see the

2191.83 --> 2196.39
expressions and the people like holy

2193.54 --> 2198.2799999999997
[ __ ] really cool stuff and there's

2196.39 --> 2199.42
another one I love is a funny one of the

2198.28 --> 2205.3300000000004
Impractical Jokers

2199.42 --> 2208.98
funny I like making unafraid Street

2205.33 --> 2212.2599999999998
stuff can be kind of amusing sometime

2208.98 --> 2215.35
yeah so that's the only way I click my

2212.26 --> 2217.63
TV log in my phone search it in my phone

2215.35 --> 2221.88
whatever I want to see put it in the TV

2217.63 --> 2225.27
but the actual media channels like the

2221.88 --> 2227.35
stream whatever regular TV having

2225.27 --> 2232.21
clicking any channel at all

2227.35 --> 2236.56
mm-hmm I sometimes do it still just see

2232.21 --> 2246.09
how bad it's become and it is mortifying

2236.56 --> 2249.93
me bad like yeah what I know about

2246.09 --> 2255.52
opening up the media here is so liberal

2249.93 --> 2259.5699999999997
it's it's just become a cartoon of

2255.52 --> 2262.45
itself it's it is literally what Alex

2259.57 --> 2264.7000000000003
Channel says like our Alex Jones

2262.45 --> 2269.29
describes liberals that's literally

2264.7 --> 2273.64
what's happening like I don't like to

2269.29 --> 2275.86
talk about it even it because yeah I'm

2273.64 --> 2281.49
not the ultra conservative or anything

2275.86 --> 2287.6800000000003
what obviously but they are in media

2281.49 --> 2292.02
promoting gay so actually horrible is

2287.68 --> 2299.02
developing it is beyond indoctrination

2292.02 --> 2303.07
it is it's so blatant like yeah the only

2299.02 --> 2303.88
way you can be happy is by being a

2303.07 --> 2308.529
that's Lee

2303.88 --> 2312.88
really almost every involving social

2308.529 --> 2314.92
things it's terrifying and they're all

2312.88 --> 2317.049
presenting it every time like oh this is

2314.92 --> 2322.9
the newest thing and you're literally

2317.049 --> 2324.91
being bombarded I did it a lot on

2322.9 --> 2327.4
Facebook because I got Facebook for

2324.91 --> 2329.589
years and I do it to contact my family

2327.4 --> 2332.4700000000003
and to share pictures and videos with

2329.589 --> 2334.9
them but I don't type I don't post a lot

2332.47 --> 2337.45
but I always click in and scroll around

2334.9 --> 2339.029
to see what people is posting and the

2337.45 --> 2340.24
sponsor news and stuff is just

2339.029 --> 2343.029
ridiculous

2340.24 --> 2346.839
so people post this video it was this

2343.029 --> 2349.859
little this little boy they do makeup

2346.839 --> 2352.599
tutorials or whatever people do like

2349.859 --> 2354.43
this little boy like a ten-year-old boy

2352.599 --> 2360.009
putting makeup on and I'm looking at

2354.43 --> 2362.019
videos and they're like oh how cute how

2360.009 --> 2366.94
adorable the comments I go like you guys

2362.019 --> 2370.6899999999996
are sick well dude look it all depends

2366.94 --> 2375.369
you know to be honest I did that kind of

2370.69 --> 2378.7200000000003
stuff too like one time just to see when

2375.369 --> 2381.88
I was really small like five or six and

2378.72 --> 2385.4199999999996
my parents were liberal that they really

2381.88 --> 2389.0190000000002
didn't care but yeah I wasn't really

2385.42 --> 2391.38
planning to be gay or I yeah I just

2389.019 --> 2394.299
wanted to see what it would look like

2391.38 --> 2397.3900000000003
sorry I guess more like an actor thing

2394.299 --> 2400.45
and there's no issue with that in my

2397.39 --> 2404.589
opinion it's when like okay this is your

2400.45 --> 2411.64
identity little is every freaking day

2404.589 --> 2414.099
that's no dude I got I got two sisters

2411.64 --> 2415.93
and they used to put makeup on me and

2414.099 --> 2417.339
dress me as a girl and we should in the

2415.93 --> 2418.8089999999997
neighborhood when I was like five and

2417.339 --> 2420.13
six years old just a little one and

2418.809 --> 2421.809
there are few years older than me

2420.13 --> 2423.549
anybody go wrong how cute you guys are

2421.809 --> 2428.71
and this little girl you know how are

2423.549 --> 2432.279
you all looking at them like what but it

2428.71 --> 2434.5
was to say as a game nore acid now they

2432.279 --> 2436.39
do it just to push a like say this is

2434.5 --> 2437.44
right this is what you have to do you

2436.39 --> 2439.69
just you

2437.44 --> 2442.48
read your child if you see anything that

2439.69 --> 2445.66
they they touch it little doll a little

2442.48 --> 2449.79
dog toy then it's gonna be a girl or

2445.66 --> 2453.67
whatever ridiculous

2449.79 --> 2456.37
yeah yeah when you get into kindergarten

2453.67 --> 2459.85
you have to roll a dice and the outcome

2456.37 --> 2463.48
will be what gender you're gonna be they

2459.85 --> 2465.88
give you a little toy car a little Hot

2463.48 --> 2467.65
Wheel and a little Barbie doll when

2465.88 --> 2469.4500000000003
you're just learning to work

2467.65 --> 2470.83
one-year-old and then when you grab they

2469.45 --> 2473.02
say all right he's gonna be a boy oh

2470.83 --> 2474.34
he's gonna be a girl bro if that extreme

2473.02 --> 2476.0099999999998
that's the way I see it it's just

2474.34 --> 2480.28
disgusting

2476.01 --> 2483.07
yeah bizarre pseudo scientific

2480.28 --> 2485.26
psychology of the world and I'm not anti

2483.07 --> 2487.1200000000003
I'm not anti gay I don't care anybody

2485.26 --> 2489.4900000000002
can have their own exactly but what I

2487.12 --> 2492.73
see is they they push their agenda they

2489.49 --> 2494.68
then like making it right making it

2492.73 --> 2497.41
right as a little boy little girl notice

2494.68 --> 2499.5099999999998
their own personal personal decision

2497.41 --> 2503.3199999999997
when you grow up however you feel like

2499.51 --> 2505.7200000000003
it used to be not now in right yeah then

2503.32 --> 2509.17
let I need to purchase ignore for a

2505.72 --> 2513.31
moment no but for real like I've had gay

2509.17 --> 2518.17
friends I still one of my best friends

2513.31 --> 2520.5099999999998
is like a transsexual like from the old

2518.17 --> 2522.04
days like a really early order there's a

2520.51 --> 2526.15
lot of medical problems because of it

2522.04 --> 2529.39
but like yeah serious I don't care I

2526.15 --> 2533.7400000000002
love this person like like a sister or

2529.39 --> 2536.5299999999997
yeah and I don't care about that it's

2533.74 --> 2540.9599999999996
all about how you conduct yourself if

2536.53 --> 2543.3100000000004
you're gonna be gay are you gonna be is

2540.96 --> 2546.19
disgusting all the time in everybody's

2543.31 --> 2549.61
face or are you gonna be some kind of

2546.19 --> 2552.67
gay Nazi like oh my god how dare you say

2549.61 --> 2555.28
anything or how dare you be homophobic

2552.67 --> 2558.55
or have some kind of response to a gay

2555.28 --> 2560.44
thing that's where I definitely draw the

2558.55 --> 2563.44
line I have no problem with people being

2560.44 --> 2566.68
gay but like all these things you should

2563.44 --> 2568.57
just kind of keep it to yourself like

2566.68 --> 2571.859
it's not like you have to hide it or

2568.57 --> 2577.539
anything you know but don't

2571.859 --> 2579.729
just be a living gay parade or if you

2577.539 --> 2584.0690000000004
want to be that there's like special

2579.729 --> 2590.229
cities what I love that [ __ ] I guess I

2584.069 --> 2593.65
don't know maybe now I am being I just I

2590.229 --> 2599.799
don't my gays absolutely not but I don't

2593.65 --> 2604.569
want everyone to be freaking gay yeah I

2599.799 --> 2608.38
want there to just be families out there

2604.569 --> 2611.849
as well and heterosexual activity

2608.38 --> 2619.7690000000002
I am heterosexual definitely trust me I

2611.849 --> 2621.88
know like like I am physically unable to

2619.769 --> 2624.519
do it the other way

2621.88 --> 2626.9790000000003
literally nauseates me physically like

2624.519 --> 2628.979
even if I would try to suspend or

2626.979 --> 2636.359
pretend no that doesn't work

2628.979 --> 2636.359
I am definitely a heterosexual male

2637.559 --> 2647.259
indeed change the subject

2639.579 --> 2651.819
yes good one so yeah that's happening

2647.259 --> 2655.599
and it saddened me and nauseates me and

2651.819 --> 2659.319
I just I don't know there's a lot of

2655.599 --> 2662.319
people kind of like drifting that are

2659.319 --> 2668.92
getting caught up in this and I see it

2662.319 --> 2671.41
and it almost makes me feel bad even

2668.92 --> 2675.309
pointing it out but they are like people

2671.41 --> 2677.949
like lost soy boys that are not like

2675.309 --> 2680.049
antifa agitated bastards or anything

2677.949 --> 2681.989
necessarily but they are like lost

2680.049 --> 2687.16
they've lost

2681.989 --> 2690.369
they've yeah they've cracked and they're

2687.16 --> 2693.8799999999997
just okay this is what I suspected of me

2690.369 --> 2696.88
this is popular I'll just do it and it

2693.88 --> 2699.94
makes me so sad to see these people walk

2696.88 --> 2706.4100000000003
around it's just like oh my god what

2699.94 --> 2706.41
have you done to yourself no no you know

2706.619 --> 2713.53
and just hope that someday they will be

2709.72 --> 2715.4199999999996
able to climb out of it yeah hold on one

2713.53 --> 2722.799
second I can I'm listening to you but I

2715.42 --> 2725.2000000000003
cannot speak but I think that pretty

2722.799 --> 2733.049
much anyone in this kind of state that's

2725.2 --> 2736.4399999999996
lost anyone can be potentially recovered

2733.049 --> 2740.17
unless they literally give over to evil

2736.44 --> 2743.2000000000003
like if they let themselves become

2740.17 --> 2746.6800000000003
totally nasty and they eventually lose

2743.2 --> 2748.839
their their spirit that the anger the

2746.68 --> 2752.0789999999997
negative structures override their

2748.839 --> 2755.23
normal spiritual human function those

2752.079 --> 2757.3900000000003
people rarely can be saved because they

2755.23 --> 2760.839
become mad they become like possessed

2757.39 --> 2763.39
and you can't get in a way but people

2760.839 --> 2766.42
that are lost and then they're still

2763.39 --> 2769.8089999999997
desperately like a flickering candle

2766.42 --> 2771.609
flame trying to stay some yeah still

2769.809 --> 2773.26
stay a human being and they're just

2771.609 --> 2775.92
severely weakened by everything that's

2773.26 --> 2778.65
lay down to them that they've taken on

2775.92 --> 2783.4
are the Solidarity illusion its

2778.65 --> 2786.2200000000003
foundation these people can be helped in

2783.4 --> 2788.44
my opinion they either need to slowly

2786.22 --> 2793.8689999999997
wake up just figure out like what am i

2788.44 --> 2800.9500000000003
doing or they need some really good

2793.869 --> 2803.77
friends that just see pretend see the

2800.95 --> 2807.18
hidden potential it's almost like it's

2803.77 --> 2811.69
like a Disney story at this point but

2807.18 --> 2812.44
yeah and you had all depends on the

2811.69 --> 2816.67
timing I guess

2812.44 --> 2821.829
No with so many awakened people in this

2816.67 --> 2824.589
world any one of these teenagers that

2821.829 --> 2826.51
are now drowning in this like they will

2824.589 --> 2827.95
become twenty years and they will do it

2826.51 --> 2829.8390000000004
in their own way they will get their own

2827.95 --> 2832.5989999999997
issues and they either to completely

2829.839 --> 2836.2889999999998
arrest in that crazy mindset or

2832.599 --> 2838.9
potentially partially crazy mindset or

2836.289 --> 2843.3100000000004
they just outgrow it

2838.9 --> 2845.26
and it loses its grip on them and they

2843.31 --> 2849.61
will just start trying out new things

2845.26 --> 2852.34
and yeah some of the people that I bump

2849.61 --> 2854.35
into them do start conversations do seem

2852.34 --> 2855.9100000000003
to have been like this some can even

2854.35 --> 2858.43
have story yep

2855.91 --> 2862.0899999999997
many people have many stories of how

2858.43 --> 2865.5099999999998
they changed and everything so there's

2862.09 --> 2868.9900000000002
just so much potential in in so many

2865.51 --> 2871.48
human beings over generalizing or just

2868.99 --> 2876.7599999999998
judging them by their apparent current

2871.48 --> 2882.79
condition on the surface it seriously

2876.76 --> 2886.09
amiss analysis usually although it's

2882.79 --> 2889.66
yeah it's you can be agitated by the

2886.09 --> 2891.58
surface of it because that that's what's

2889.66 --> 2893.71
what's going to be seen that's what's

2891.58 --> 2895.87
gonna be part of the color of the world

2893.71 --> 2900.88
scene so yeah that can be aggravating

2895.87 --> 2902.89
annoying a bad example but to reduce a

2900.88 --> 2906.03
person's identity purely to that

2902.89 --> 2909.2999999999997
superficial visible thing and not their

2906.03 --> 2912.4300000000003
potential over time and how they can

2909.3 --> 2918.27
potentially grow that's just dishonest

2912.43 --> 2918.27
really again

2921.61 --> 2928.07
good stuff I heard him and I was trying

2925.31 --> 2930.41
to one of the little doggies he was born

2928.07 --> 2933.32
a chi one of their little girls she was

2930.41 --> 2938.33
born with day how do you call with the

2933.32 --> 2943.04
like the leap thing like she got like

2938.33 --> 2944.99
the cut in the the top lip the sickness

2943.04 --> 2948.02
like working Phoenix what how do you

2944.99 --> 2950.0899999999997
call that daddy what's it like the

2948.02 --> 2952.85
palate it did they say there's a

2950.09 --> 2956.06
condition that people are born and they

2952.85 --> 2959.72
got this like in the top lip they got

2956.06 --> 2961.52
this like sliced all right yeah I know

2959.72 --> 2965.0
what you mean let me find that word

2961.52 --> 2968.09
laboring apparently in Spanish it's love

2965.0 --> 2971.87
in Spanish is Lipari no la vie au lait

2968.09 --> 2973.61
Purina are annoying English yeah so

2971.87 --> 2976.5499999999997
cheese one of those and she doesn't want

2973.61 --> 2980.44
to lactate she doesn't she cannot get

2976.55 --> 2988.84
the milk because she's like a help like

2980.44 --> 2988.84
Haley yeah yeah yeah or Shiloh she sees

2988.99 --> 2995.47
yeah weird name anyway yeah

2997.44 --> 3000.4
it happens

3003.89 --> 3006.549
yeah

3016.52 --> 3025.58
so anything else you want to bring up

3021.91 --> 3029.0899999999997
maybe some leading to debates we got 10

3025.58 --> 3034.67
more minutes Jose Hey

3029.09 --> 3037.67
I'm good all right right

3034.67 --> 3046.01
what's the matter talk I hope you all

3037.67 --> 3048.05
enjoyed the show I do see a more I see I

3046.01 --> 3050.15
am tending to become a little bit more

3048.05 --> 3053.48
preachy but yeah I need to fill the time

3050.15 --> 3059.36
in the show so it's okay yeah do it man

3053.48 --> 3063.08
be you right and I have I have noticed

3059.36 --> 3065.9900000000002
this plus I give you a thumbs up since

3063.08 --> 3068.81
you start doing the early bird when it's

3065.99 --> 3073.4599999999996
the time of the florid debate you have

3068.81 --> 3075.619
been less less argumentative less

3073.46 --> 3078.44
targeted even by the other guys because

3075.619 --> 3080.48
you kind of just release it in the early

3078.44 --> 3082.609
bird you get to talk and speak up and

3080.48 --> 3084.14
and you know just just faint a little

3082.609 --> 3085.97
bit a nice kid you know in Iraq with

3084.14 --> 3087.92
with some of us and then in the fly I

3085.97 --> 3090.08
devalue Galaga ride in my part Austin

3087.92 --> 3091.88
gonna interject I still gonna argue you

3090.08 --> 3093.79
know but but it's cool it's cool I'm

3091.88 --> 3098.42
happy for you man it's working out good

3093.79 --> 3100.16
yeah indeed yeah yeah you hit the nail

3098.42 --> 3105.38
on the head that's exactly how I feel

3100.16 --> 3108.47
about it I experienced it yeah because I

3105.38 --> 3112.04
do need to talk I have things to express

3108.47 --> 3113.39
and I want to show things that I'm

3112.04 --> 3117.56
dealing with the way that I'm thinking

3113.39 --> 3120.44
and yeah I need that off my chest

3117.56 --> 3123.56
basically in social interaction and I

3120.44 --> 3127.7000000000003
can do it complete yeah more than I need

3123.56 --> 3132.08
in here so I can just not have this

3127.7 --> 3134.47
factly flu really if you manifest on the

3132.08 --> 3137.5099999999998
show so much I'll be less interruptive

3134.47 --> 3139.1299999999997
unless I just really see like okay this

3137.51 --> 3141.8
is not going anywhere I need to

3139.13 --> 3145.4300000000003
interject this right now and that's why

3141.8 --> 3147.5
I do that yeah good and nobody's gonna

3145.43 --> 3150.2889999999998
tell you no no no no that's no science

3147.5 --> 3152.059
so you you just just so story not these

3150.289 --> 3154.219
Joe is yours if you wanted to your eyes

3152.059 --> 3156.3190000000004
if you and I created your so story if we

3154.219 --> 3158.63
want to tell stories I mean do you do it

3156.319 --> 3160.91
if your job is your you rules and

3158.63 --> 3164.119
regulations you know so yeah I guess

3160.91 --> 3167.479
good for you I like it but I'm also just

3164.119 --> 3169.819
working it out like in the past I did

3167.479 --> 3171.439
this kind of thing just in conversations

3169.819 --> 3176.479
a lot I've been doing this since I was

3171.439 --> 3178.669
like 15 but yeah in my thinking

3176.479 --> 3180.439
structures I had a lot of Miss

3178.669 --> 3183.049
assumptions early on because I just

3180.439 --> 3184.759
didn't see didn't understand a lot of

3183.049 --> 3187.279
things had never experienced things so I

3184.759 --> 3190.999
would just theorize in the social manner

3187.279 --> 3195.259
but now that I'm much older like

3190.999 --> 3198.229
seriously I just twenty three years okay

3195.259 --> 3200.179
twenty three years is a lot I know so

3198.229 --> 3204.6789999999996
much more about how things actually work

3200.179 --> 3207.739
from experience and I learned like how I

3204.679 --> 3210.65
made my mistakes that I'm just more

3207.739 --> 3212.329
careful now in doing this and I'm pretty

3210.65 --> 3214.9990000000003
certain that most of the things that I

3212.329 --> 3222.0190000000002
structure eyes that I reason about are

3214.999 --> 3225.1989999999996
as good as correct are mostly correct

3222.019 --> 3225.919
I might make just a language mistake

3225.199 --> 3228.4990000000003
here and there

3225.919 --> 3230.029
I still do that's very annoying I hate

3228.499 --> 3235.3999999999996
it when I do that but it happens and it

3230.029 --> 3238.359
just I slips my attention and but I

3235.4 --> 3242.2090000000003
think that many of the predictions I do

3238.359 --> 3247.219
our analysis are pretty good and they

3242.209 --> 3251.39
will stand the test of time I I believe

3247.219 --> 3253.64
this I feel this I am certain that I

3251.39 --> 3257.749
know my skill I know myself I know what

3253.64 --> 3259.3089999999997
I'm doing enough to have this certainty

3257.749 --> 3261.4289999999996
about it that's basically it's

3259.309 --> 3265.8190000000004
confidence it's just confidence and

3261.429 --> 3269.179
experience because yeah oh my god when I

3265.819 --> 3272.419
was younger I underestimated so badly

3269.179 --> 3274.759
how much experience matters

3272.419 --> 3276.2889999999998
I thought that you could get anything

3274.759 --> 3280.029
with insight it's the kind of Miss

3276.289 --> 3283.6090000000004
assumption that also ballers have with

3280.029 --> 3283.94
calculus that just if you can reason it

3283.609 --> 3286.64
out

3283.94 --> 3288.92
it must be real that's one of the merits

3286.64 --> 3293.2999999999997
they love your money girl I was young a

3288.92 --> 3296.0
lot but you really gotta see the whole

3293.3 --> 3297.92
thing to confirm it to see how it

3296.0 --> 3302.42
actually works and to see what you

3297.92 --> 3305.21
didn't know yet of what is actually in

3302.42 --> 3306.89
being and what actually exists and it's

3305.21 --> 3310.67
only when you know everything that you

3306.89 --> 3313.25
get a more clear full picture and you've

3310.67 --> 3316.7000000000003
got to realize that yeah even with this

3313.25 --> 3320.45
apparent full picture right now I might

3316.7 --> 3324.35
still be just not even seeing certain

3320.45 --> 3326.93
fields of influences even with the

3324.35 --> 3329.0
theories I have about them and like the

3326.93 --> 3331.8799999999997
New World Order thing controllers ply

3329.0 --> 3333.92
mind control all that there may still be

3331.88 --> 3336.65
other elements out there in spiritual

3333.92 --> 3339.89
energy the godly there may be structures

3336.65 --> 3343.13
elements out there that I haven't even

3339.89 --> 3346.45
really touched upon that will give a new

3343.13 --> 3348.94
structure a new depth a new solidity to

3346.45 --> 3352.0699999999997
so much as I've been dealing with and

3348.94 --> 3354.89
dispelling certain elements that were

3352.07 --> 3357.56
slightly uncertain orders despite

3354.89 --> 3361.79
speculation anyways want a meta talk I'm

3357.56 --> 3363.47
gonna round out the show yeah it might

3361.79 --> 3365.15
