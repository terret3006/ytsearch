71.85 --> 82.94999999999999
weather today is absolutely gorgeous

77.09 --> 86.84
it's amazing it's hot it's nice fresh

82.95 --> 91.02000000000001
wind and there's just a couple of clouds

86.84 --> 94.41
like in-between the pretty much blue sky

91.02 --> 98.25
makes a very nice variation of some and

94.41 --> 100.59
a bit of shadow it's just one of them

98.25 --> 104.729
yeah one of the most beautiful days

100.59 --> 107.76
practically that I've had so far and I

104.729 --> 111.81
enjoyed basically laying down in the

107.76 --> 114.869
grass at a little park in the shadow of

111.81 --> 118.65
a tree smoking a joint looking upwards

114.869 --> 122.25
into the blue sky and also seeing

118.65 --> 124.67
swallows by the way in the middle of the

122.25 --> 128.21
daytime and there were pretty high up

124.67 --> 128.21
was interesting

129.11 --> 133.37
yeah and all the birds out here are just

132.08 --> 138.56
killing everywhere

133.37 --> 140.87
bees bumble bees also seen I haven't

138.56 --> 143.24
seen any wasps and I'm kind of glad of

140.87 --> 145.87
that because I hate wasps but I haven't

143.24 --> 157.0
seen them at all but a lot of bees a

145.87 --> 157.0
nice overall nice ecology yeah

157.92 --> 165.83999999999997
and there's a lot of seagulls going

160.23 --> 169.069
around as usual they're just floating up

165.84 --> 169.06900000000002
there all day with this heat

173.49 --> 179.86
also yeah a few days ago I saw what

177.43 --> 181.989
seemed to be like a flock of bugs I

179.86 --> 183.61
thought at first they were like Jun

181.989 --> 186.39000000000001
bucks because they were that size they

183.61 --> 186.39000000000001
were really big

187.09 --> 192.73
and they weren't huge bumble beads they

189.4 --> 195.459
were a really different type of beetle

192.73 --> 200.41
very much like a June bug but not with

195.459 --> 205.53
those typical colors and the fuzziness

200.41 --> 210.04
to it but rather more a brown a

205.53 --> 211.87
reddish-brown color with some I don't

210.04 --> 214.39
know I didn't get a real careful look

211.87 --> 217.06
for too long they actually have one on

214.39 --> 219.60999999999999
my hand at some point but they weren't

217.06 --> 221.5
really very clingy like June bugs

219.61 --> 223.989
typically just go and sit on you they

221.5 --> 227.11
don't give a [Â __Â ] sometimes they seem a

223.989 --> 228.91
bit lost fly into things these books

227.11 --> 230.38000000000002
were seemed to have been a little bit

228.91 --> 231.88
more coordinated in the way they were

230.38 --> 237.329
spreading out it seems like they were

231.88 --> 240.22
doing a an evening dance of some kind

237.329 --> 244.0
they're all hanging around here at the

240.22 --> 246.64
corner of the roof it was really

244.0 --> 252.75
interesting to see that anyway the

246.64 --> 256.65
nature report here so let's use in chat

252.75 --> 256.65
interesting person in chat

260.489 --> 268.67999999999995
see a check oh good to see you Daniel

263.83 --> 271.78
yes you are unlocked son monkey 3d and

268.68 --> 275.62
beyond the imaginary curve of Dell has

271.78 --> 280.09
honored us with his presence seems to be

275.62 --> 283.0
in a the mood looking for trouble I

280.09 --> 287.46999999999997
think I wonder how he's doing I haven't

283.0 --> 290.29
really paid a lot of attention I'd

287.47 --> 292.51000000000005
recommend him to basically go go out

290.29 --> 293.95000000000005
it's the perfect weather for it he

292.51 --> 297.73
shouldn't always hang around in this

293.95 --> 299.53
basement you know what people's what

297.73 --> 301.24
some people what some groups say about

299.53 --> 306.13
the influence of the Sun it's really

301.24 --> 308.08
nonsense every person needs Sun you

306.13 --> 312.49
don't need to like bathe in it all day

308.08 --> 314.68
long but you just even if just in direct

312.49 --> 316.21000000000004
sunlight you just need you need some of

314.68 --> 320.02
this it's really important for your

316.21 --> 321.60999999999996
metabolism and your overall health and I

320.02 --> 324.13
don't think Dell does that a lot

321.61 --> 326.16900000000004
although I'm not too sure but I would

324.13 --> 329.29
recommend that to go on the same route

326.169 --> 331.24
as Roxanne has who is by the way life

329.29 --> 333.16
right now at this moment for those who

331.24 --> 336.90000000000003
are interested in some actual live

333.16 --> 339.64000000000004
street activism concerning flat earth I

336.9 --> 343.12
can't top this it's yeah this is what

339.64 --> 349.89
Rick said Roxanne does you know what I

343.12 --> 349.89
presented for for a sec I can do that

350.63 --> 366.29
Oh to find the right hold on guys anyway

362.12 --> 370.52
I put the link out so you can already go

366.29 --> 373.72
there but I'll just show it without

370.52 --> 376.54999999999995
sound that's to show what it's like and

373.72 --> 378.98
yeah it's basically this with with

376.55 --> 381.14
actual interactive talking and now

378.98 --> 382.34000000000003
Roxanne is discussing something with a

381.14 --> 385.07
fellow flat earther

382.34 --> 387.89
we're also vegan by the way I heard one

385.07 --> 389.57
of his speeches and they had discussions

387.89 --> 392.71999999999997
with Globus as well there was this one

389.57 --> 397.79
guy that came up to them like really

392.72 --> 399.5
proud like oh yeah I I remember exactly

397.79 --> 401.06
what my teacher taught me about the glow

399.5 --> 403.34
and he was basically putting it down

401.06 --> 406.4
like oh yeah I paid so much attention to

403.34 --> 410.69
class and super confident any basically

406.4 --> 413.69
pulled out the the ultra basics it was

410.69 --> 416.93
so typical so it's very interesting

413.69 --> 422.68
I do recommend for people to subscribe

416.93 --> 425.84000000000003
to your channel it's yeah I advertise

422.68 --> 428.45
my's my show on other people on other

425.84 --> 430.19
people shows in the chat but if I think

428.45 --> 432.2
it's really awesome what they're doing I

430.19 --> 435.02
will definitely also give them a

432.2 --> 439.96999999999997
shout-out and link up with them so that

435.02 --> 443.12
people go and subscribe and Roxanne

439.97 --> 447.64000000000004
currently has I think 3.2 K subscribers

443.12 --> 447.64
well for all the work she puts into it

448.66 --> 454.55
constant personal exposure I think

452.0 --> 456.35
that's very yeah I think that's very

454.55 --> 458.92
decent she should probably have a lot

456.35 --> 458.92
more than that

460.69 --> 467.09
as I sometimes feel about myself so yeah

464.33 --> 471.34999999999997
check it out if you don't want to see

467.09 --> 474.09999999999997
our when talking but yeah I hope I will

471.35 --> 474.1
make it worth it

477.5 --> 482.75
oh yeah that's a good one James Mason

480.32 --> 489.2
indeed grounding take off your shoes

482.75 --> 493.1
bare feet take off your socks and indeed

489.2 --> 495.74
let them touch the grass and like what

493.1 --> 500.66
what can also be very satisfying is like

495.74 --> 504.61
forest dirt but not the type that you

500.66 --> 507.8
would typically have a tape a a pathway

504.61 --> 509.96000000000004
from walking over because that's yeah

507.8 --> 512.65
it's like dirty but like more in the

509.96 --> 517.76
middle of the forest just a patch of

512.65 --> 520.039
uncovered dirt or mud or something if

517.76 --> 522.77
it's not yeah if that's doable and just

520.039 --> 527.18
yeah I love that stuff I've also had

522.77 --> 533.6899999999999
awesome experiences just sitting in at

527.18 --> 535.64
the edge of a small brook it is I guess

533.69 --> 537.74
is like it's not like it's not a river

535.64 --> 542.33
it's a small brook there are some of

537.74 --> 544.28
those well where I used to live in in

542.33 --> 547.7900000000001
the south of south east of holland and

544.28 --> 549.86
limber and over that yeah they have

547.79 --> 553.9699999999999
these rivers that come in from Germany

549.86 --> 555.8000000000001
and this they're sort of artificially

553.97 --> 558.9100000000001
kept like that and it's just glorious

555.8 --> 562.4599999999999
these little streams keep on going it's

558.91 --> 566.27
it is magical and yeah I went out even

562.46 --> 568.3100000000001
with my ex and just sit there put your

566.27 --> 569.8299999999999
feet in that water at the side of it

568.31 --> 573.26
it's just an amazing experience

569.83 --> 578.0
beautiful woods around it and creatures

573.26 --> 581.0699999999999
all over the place fishies tadpoles

578.0 --> 586.41
you know I love that stuff

581.07 --> 589.4100000000001
I miss that a bit because yeah that

586.41 --> 593.009
region was had a lot of that more

589.41 --> 595.139
pristine forest like regions to visit

593.009 --> 598.44
not so much over it

595.139 --> 604.17
it's still pretty damn decent for an for

598.44 --> 607.259
a urban / suburban area like they really

604.17 --> 609.5999999999999
maintained the green well enough but

607.259 --> 612.899
it's not the same thing as more a wild

609.6 --> 614.759
forest type region where we're really

612.899 --> 616.649
there's just no houses anywhere and

614.759 --> 622.13
there's not people walking around or

616.649 --> 622.13
cars it's it's not the same

623.54 --> 631.68
[Music]

625.85 --> 634.5
so I do miss that a bit but yeah it's

631.68 --> 636.39
good enough it's doable for now but I do

634.5 --> 644.79
kind of start too long for it a little

636.39 --> 648.36
bit back mm-hmm yeah yeah Dell yeah I'm

644.79 --> 649.98
just talking about my life and what I'm

648.36 --> 653.82
thinking about what I'm doing and

649.98 --> 657.33
sometimes yeah I do deal with really

653.82 --> 660.71
complicated subjects or people ask me

657.33 --> 664.6800000000001
complicated questions and then the

660.71 --> 667.4100000000001
intellects that you find so hilarious to

664.68 --> 669.5999999999999
quote then it sets in and then I

667.41 --> 671.4
actually do that but it's not like I'm

669.6 --> 676.34
constantly on that level that's

671.4 --> 685.47
impossible you can't have a conversation

676.34 --> 695.0400000000001
constantly doing that hmm and besides it

685.47 --> 697.77
is Sunday and it's a warm Sunday and I

695.04 --> 699.66
have plenty of time to do to do my show

697.77 --> 703.17
you know I could potentially go on for

699.66 --> 705.51
three hours I have in the past depending

703.17 --> 708.36
of um if there were some guests because

705.51 --> 712.41
it's just me talking I'm not gonna hang

708.36 --> 714.3000000000001
in there for three hours but yeah if

712.41 --> 717.06
people are interested to get on have

714.3 --> 721.56
something to share or newcomers wanna

717.06 --> 725.51
like take a chance and come live on my

721.56 --> 728.0699999999999
show then yeah this is the time to do it

725.51 --> 731.54
Saturday as well but sunday seems to

728.07 --> 731.5400000000001
work even better for a lot of people

734.48 --> 745.29
you do I'm passing comments on you come

741.57 --> 747.63
on look I do joke a little bit about

745.29 --> 750.75
certain character traits that you

747.63 --> 753.93
possess but I don't have ill-will

750.75 --> 757.23
towards you I hope you realize that you

753.93 --> 760.53
know I joke I try to joke about everyone

757.23 --> 767.52
a little bit because that's good I about

760.53 --> 770.61
myself as much as I can because that

767.52 --> 772.4399999999999
gives opportunity to see things and then

770.61 --> 774.63
be able to potentially improve them

772.44 --> 777.96
because if you never joke about if you

774.63 --> 780.3
never touch upon those things then

777.96 --> 784.01
they'll start to become hidden and your

780.3 --> 784.01
subconscious will take over the reins

788.57 --> 791.96
holy [Â __Â ]

792.83 --> 799.1700000000001
wow that's

794.37 --> 801.62
that sounds really grim Dell Dell says

799.17 --> 807.41
all I ever hear is negative and

801.62 --> 807.41
barefaced lies why are you hearing that

812.529 --> 818.579
well what did I lie about about you -

815.139 --> 818.5790000000001
please tell me can you be more specific

820.139 --> 826.9590000000001
look I'm pretty aware that I probably

822.729 --> 828.479
have like ya poked at your feelings I do

826.959 --> 835.2689999999999
that sometimes

828.479 --> 840.129
what Oh in chat okay all right let's see

835.269 --> 842.259
what what was said okay you came in I'm

840.129 --> 842.739
interested to see what's so different

842.259 --> 845.8290000000001
about

842.739 --> 849.909
Arwen and its format after hearing all

845.829 --> 855.2489999999999
the criticism has of everyone else go on

849.909 --> 857.379
our win you wannabe [Â __Â ] well that

855.249 --> 859.269
last set and seems kind of like ruining

857.379 --> 862.719
the whole set up now does it because

859.269 --> 864.879
yeah you know you may have somewhat of a

862.719 --> 869.4090000000001
point I do indeed

864.879 --> 872.9490000000001
like apply criticism but I've also been

869.409 --> 880.989
pretty clear why I do that and I have no

872.949 --> 886.5089999999999
ill will you know I I try to provide

880.989 --> 890.889
constructive criticism and sometimes

886.509 --> 895.689
that can be a little bit touchy so yeah

890.889 --> 898.029
oh yeah and then I love it when you say

895.689 --> 901.179
things like this show me the level of

898.029 --> 901.809
your superior intellect I know you say

901.179 --> 904.209
it like that

901.809 --> 906.159
and that's why when you type it I just

904.209 --> 909.2489999999999
hear it like that and I love that [Â __Â ]

906.159 --> 912.489
I love the way how you pronounce some

909.249 --> 919.509
things when you're when you're trying to

912.489 --> 925.269
make fun of it so oh yeah yeah okay

919.509 --> 931.719
right I said hey oh you said hey gum

925.269 --> 934.289
bumper I don't even know I wonder if I I

931.719 --> 938.979
truly want to know what that means but

934.289 --> 940.689
I'll just leave that to what you like to

938.979 --> 944.249
think about then I asked how's the

940.689 --> 944.2489999999999
weather over there have you checked yet

944.66 --> 952.5
and you never answered that and you just

948.69 --> 955.62
said piss flaps as usual it's it's weird

952.5 --> 958.38
it must be like your local type of way

955.62 --> 965.009
of talking local slang because it just

958.38 --> 968.61
seems kind of surreal to me is that your

965.009 --> 969.779
psychic power at work again there you go

968.61 --> 972.63
again I love it

969.779 --> 975.149
I almost wish you were actually live on

972.63 --> 978.24
my show to say that in person because I

975.149 --> 982.56
know you would say it in a very very

978.24 --> 984.69
interesting way and then you ask how

982.56 --> 989.25
many fingers am i holding up well that's

984.69 --> 991.6800000000001
obvious okay one of course after that

989.25 --> 995.519
you kind of stay silent because I was

991.68 --> 999.5
probably right at it so yeah that's

995.519 --> 999.5
that's what we were talking about

1008.1 --> 1016.89
right thanks James Mason indeed I was

1012.48 --> 1023.1800000000001
not being malicious with with slick but

1016.89 --> 1023.18
I was very very agitated by him though

1025.67 --> 1031.22
he started to feel very monotonous to me

1043.59 --> 1049.99
well what I said about have you checked

1046.51 --> 1052.6
the weather that that was actually very

1049.99 --> 1055.0
carefully covered up joke that

1052.6 --> 1059.1699999999998
references to a rumor that goes around

1055.0 --> 1061.96
about Dell that he's always in his man

1059.17 --> 1065.92
cave in the shadows like some vampire

1061.96 --> 1069.49
and I have no idea to what extent that

1065.92 --> 1072.3400000000001
is actually accurate but it is something

1069.49 --> 1074.53
that it is why more widely recognized

1072.34 --> 1076.78
and that is how the joke was constructed

1074.53 --> 1078.73
without being politically oh you're

1076.78 --> 1084.22
stupid too Empire or something like that

1078.73 --> 1087.4
because that's just a yeah a dumb thing

1084.22 --> 1089.3500000000001
to do and I don't think that they'll

1087.4 --> 1094.8100000000002
really is like that I think they'll has

1089.35 --> 1099.1599999999999
some issues with with his emotions in

1094.81 --> 1102.1299999999999
the sense that his emotions can take

1099.16 --> 1104.44
over control pretty easily in relation

1102.13 --> 1108.3100000000002
to the average and that's pretty much it

1104.44 --> 1111.49
he has good sides he is yes angry sighs

1108.31 --> 1118.84
he has dark sides but he also has just

1111.49 --> 1120.79
very modest side so the only real big

1118.84 --> 1122.6799999999998
problem he has is that he gets really

1120.79 --> 1126.6399999999999
moody and he apparently doesn't really

1122.68 --> 1131.23
know how to break that cycle that's

1126.64 --> 1134.5600000000002
really in my personal analysis is yeah

1131.23 --> 1139.81
my opinion that he somehow needs to

1134.56 --> 1142.6
break his bad mood cycle and find some

1139.81 --> 1145.33
way to reroute that energy which is kind

1142.6 --> 1149.35
of like a superfluous extra energy that

1145.33 --> 1154.21
he can't use and enable himself to

1149.35 --> 1156.4599999999998
invest it more constructively so that

1154.21 --> 1160.45
he's not moody all the time and just his

1156.46 --> 1162.73
more clear mind itself because that's

1160.45 --> 1166.75
the way how you progress understanding

1162.73 --> 1172.09
and find solutions not by being angry

1166.75 --> 1175.049
and agitated all the time so yeah I got

1172.09 --> 1179.6789999999999
to Mara coffee of course

1175.049 --> 1183.399
immediately kept going I got tea oh yeah

1179.679 --> 1184.96
I got an apple a new type I the other

1183.399 --> 1188.379
one wasn't around but this one looked

1184.96 --> 1191.08
pretty decent and I'm gonna try it see

1188.379 --> 1194.1689999999999
if it's nice also I got this awesome

1191.08 --> 1198.1
there's like this lemonade and if you

1194.169 --> 1200.6490000000001
dilute it really slightly very subtly

1198.1 --> 1201.7489999999998
with like good filtered water it looks

1200.649 --> 1206.07
delicious

1201.749 --> 1209.47
it's lemon with a bit of ginger in it

1206.07 --> 1212.889
but it's very light very very very light

1209.47 --> 1214.809
and if you put it in this bottle which

1212.889 --> 1219.34
is a very interesting drink bottle but

1214.809 --> 1223.6589999999999
that's look at the shape it's a what is

1219.34 --> 1226.09
it a Tartarian design from Spain I might

1223.659 --> 1227.44
actually I was kind of joking but there

1226.09 --> 1230.379
there is something very interesting

1227.44 --> 1231.279
about this bowl the way it pours it's

1230.379 --> 1234.9989999999998
very stable

1231.279 --> 1238.029
there is some kind of weird design thing

1234.999 --> 1240.97
to this and it's beautiful and if you

1238.029 --> 1244.299
put this in the fridge it stays once it

1240.97 --> 1246.8990000000001
really gets cold it stays cold very long

1244.299 --> 1249.369
even in the heat like this is still

1246.899 --> 1255.1899999999998
really cold and I took it out of the

1249.369 --> 1259.59
fridge one and a half hour ago like if I

1255.19 --> 1262.24
do that with this bottle it's gonna be

1259.59 --> 1266.1689999999999
room temperature within half an hour

1262.24 --> 1271.05
I think I haven't actually checked this

1266.169 --> 1277.8200000000002
but I don't know it's interesting

1271.05 --> 1277.82
oh so good

1281.559 --> 1288.02
it's not as impactful as a fresh organic

1285.41 --> 1289.0400000000002
orange juice you know because that just

1288.02 --> 1291.95
boom

1289.04 --> 1294.32
but still it's so nice it's the best

1291.95 --> 1296.179
form a lemonade in my opinion there's

1294.32 --> 1298.6799999999998
other tastes too but this for this type

1296.179 --> 1301.8190000000002
of weather this is the best

1298.68 --> 1301.819
[Music]

1308.91 --> 1317.67
what my deep insecurities you mean the

1314.94 --> 1326.28
ones that I actually completely openly

1317.67 --> 1331.5900000000001
talk about on my show where I bear one

1326.28 --> 1336.45
of the more well sensitive regions with

1331.59 --> 1341.72
the world openly it's very rare that

1336.45 --> 1345.06
people actually do that I'm not hiding

1341.72 --> 1349.8
from my issues I'm very open

1345.06 --> 1353.28
I'm almost religiously open and honest

1349.8 --> 1360.27
about these things because there's an

1353.28 --> 1363.3899999999999
extra reward for doing that it is logos

1360.27 --> 1365.34
it's walking the path and I trust in

1363.39 --> 1368.64
this I've experienced this to be true

1365.34 --> 1370.59
and I'm learning as I go over the years

1368.64 --> 1374.0400000000002
and this is taking a very long time in

1370.59 --> 1376.62
my personal opinion it's taken too long

1374.04 --> 1381.3899999999999
but there's no use complaining about it

1376.62 --> 1385.77
only good thing to do is finally get it

1381.39 --> 1389.5500000000002
rolling and apply harvest all the skill

1385.77 --> 1392.12
that I've gained with what seemed at

1389.55 --> 1394.98
first like completely wasting my time

1392.12 --> 1398.2199999999998
but I have gained skill and I need to

1394.98 --> 1402.65
harvest that refine it and then apply it

1398.22 --> 1407.07
retroactively Lee basically use it and

1402.65 --> 1411.38
make up for what appear to be wasting my

1407.07 --> 1411.3799999999999
time at first and making bad decisions

1417.36 --> 1422.889
surrounding myself with the wrong people

1419.74 --> 1426.48
wait are you criticizing the people in

1422.889 --> 1430.99
chat here they're great people like

1426.48 --> 1437.7
seriously the people in my chat I really

1430.99 --> 1441.009
well I love him okay a lot of them and

1437.7 --> 1443.259
like I feel a bond even though it's just

1441.009 --> 1445.3890000000001
a piece of text with most of them but I

1443.259 --> 1450.879
can feel them I can sense if it is them

1445.389 --> 1455.1999999999998
and they're very decent and they really

1450.879 --> 1458.9989999999998
listen and I've seen them evolve their

1455.2 --> 1458.999
thinking as I've done the show

1475.869 --> 1487.549
what but okay so how do I do that

1482.21 --> 1490.3400000000001
do I go to your chat now and tell people

1487.549 --> 1495.44
oh my God look at this guy he's totally

1490.34 --> 1499.609
an idiot or something do I do that where

1495.44 --> 1502.239
am i spreading where I'm telling where

1499.609 --> 1504.32
am i telling people not to watch you

1502.239 --> 1506.659
look there may have been certain

1504.32 --> 1510.9189999999999
specific situations in the past where

1506.659 --> 1513.919
you have absolutely displayed very bad

1510.919 --> 1516.5590000000002
behavior dark behavior and I've you know

1513.919 --> 1520.3090000000002
this is true whether you are gonna admit

1516.559 --> 1523.19
it in public or not and then then only

1520.309 --> 1525.399
really will I tell people okay just if

1523.19 --> 1528.0990000000002
he behaves like that just don't go there

1525.399 --> 1530.57
it's no use

1528.099 --> 1531.229
starting to fight that behavior zone and

1530.57 --> 1534.769
get worse

1531.229 --> 1537.979
and that's really it because I in yeah I

1534.769 --> 1541.549
don't tell people oh my god we have to

1537.979 --> 1544.3990000000001
boycott Dell from the imaginary Kurth I

1541.549 --> 1555.889
did I don't get this hostility from you

1544.399 --> 1558.649
really passing false judgment how I'm

1555.889 --> 1562.2199999999998
basically just analyzing people and

1558.649 --> 1567.039
giving my analysis how is that passing

1562.22 --> 1567.039
false judgment I don't get it

1572.05 --> 1582.1599999999999
I don't say it directly

1577.65 --> 1585.39
stop acting sorry but I get the feeling

1582.16 --> 1587.98
you're trying to dig for some kind of

1585.39 --> 1592.63
conspiratorial underline to what I'm

1587.98 --> 1596.95
doing but I'm not doing that any kind of

1592.63 --> 1599.5900000000001
seemingly conspiratorial Subs framework

1596.95 --> 1603.7
structure that you find that you detect

1599.59 --> 1605.35
within everything I say it may be there

1603.7 --> 1609.45
there may be something there but you

1605.35 --> 1613.12
know why it's there because I can

1609.45 --> 1615.76
because I get that [Â __Â ] and I kind of

1613.12 --> 1618.4599999999998
love to [Â __Â ] around with it sometimes in

1615.76 --> 1624.34
a in a non-hostile way in a creative way

1618.46 --> 1631.0
like Legos I like tinkering with a cult

1624.34 --> 1633.1899999999998
[Â __Â ] but I also detach from the people

1631.0 --> 1635.41
that tend to over in the power structure

1633.19 --> 1638.04
apply those messages in this very

1635.41 --> 1640.8400000000001
specific setting and what I'm doing is

1638.04 --> 1642.55
taking their symbols that they've

1640.84 --> 1645.37
hijacked that they've taken and

1642.55 --> 1648.07
corrupted and set into a into a vile

1645.37 --> 1650.32
framework taking them out and trying to

1648.07 --> 1653.8899999999999
give them new energetic purpose a new

1650.32 --> 1657.1899999999998
place to switch to to change the

1653.89 --> 1659.47
energies I've been trying this for a

1657.19 --> 1664.14
long time it's how my symbol came into

1659.47 --> 1668.8600000000001
being that the two conjoined pentagrams

1664.14 --> 1672.0400000000002
the the ten star do you see how far that

1668.86 --> 1674.9499999999998
reach is now even now with the

1672.04 --> 1680.6399999999999
revivalism of the male-female relation

1674.95 --> 1684.91
which the two pentagrams also represent

1680.64 --> 1689.2
besides the Oh be trying to be human and

1684.91 --> 1694.38
trying to be inhuman because that was

1689.2 --> 1694.38
hijacked symbols are extremely ancient

1698.0 --> 1703.07
okay hello trolls versus trolls

1705.39 --> 1708.539
[Music]

1711.41 --> 1718.5800000000002
now but look the two pentagrams in this

1714.92 --> 1726.0500000000002
are conjoined that doesn't mean that

1718.58 --> 1728.6
they literally become one there are two

1726.05 --> 1732.85
separate line structures still

1728.6 --> 1735.3799999999999
technically that just conjoined like a

1732.85 --> 1741.59
man and a woman having sex for example

1735.38 --> 1743.63
and add that the possibilities for

1741.59 --> 1745.73
structural interpretations of these

1743.63 --> 1748.8200000000002
types of symbols that I have created

1745.73 --> 1752.06
even myself a long time ago and didn't

1748.82 --> 1753.98
even completely understand it but still

1752.06 --> 1761.1499999999999
had a feel for it had a feel for the

1753.98 --> 1762.83
direction and I've written pieces that

1761.15 --> 1766.1000000000001
are still on the internet to this day

1762.83 --> 1770.26
about the effects of symbols and

1766.1 --> 1773.51
patterns and what it does to the psyche

1770.26 --> 1774.98
I've studied this I've made it I tried

1773.51 --> 1777.53
to make an ohm oh yeah it's a

1774.98 --> 1780.2
pseudoscience psychological study that I

1777.53 --> 1783.26
did just in the run it took me like half

1780.2 --> 1785.42
a year to completely get a kind of

1783.26 --> 1788.57
balance tree read on it

1785.42 --> 1790.91
it's it's yeah it could do a lot more

1788.57 --> 1793.61
work and unleash the a eye on it

1790.91 --> 1796.0700000000002
metadata statistical analysis oh yeah

1793.61 --> 1798.77
then it probably turns out to be a

1796.07 --> 1800.6299999999999
pretty cheap attempt at a final

1798.77 --> 1801.92
framework of how it actually all works

1800.63 --> 1804.74
which is probably a little bit more

1801.92 --> 1808.3400000000001
complicated but still for me it provided

1804.74 --> 1813.68
a very good framework in how shapes and

1808.34 --> 1815.84
symbols work and what they do to those

1813.68 --> 1820.25
that open themselves up to it that to

1815.84 --> 1822.7099999999998
those that have thoughts and how typical

1820.25 --> 1824.69
types of thoughts and trains of thoughts

1822.71 --> 1828.14
and trains of feelings directions in

1824.69 --> 1833.0800000000002
their lives will reflect on those types

1828.14 --> 1833.0800000000002
of symbol and pattern effects

1844.389 --> 1850.4599999999998
well beyond the imaginary curve no

1848.119 --> 1856.1899999999998
there's not a symbol a symbol to make

1850.46 --> 1860.109
you believe anything but see look there

1856.19 --> 1863.5700000000002
are always reflections of the mind okay

1860.109 --> 1865.519
symbols can't make you do anything but

1863.57 --> 1867.649
if you have certain energy certain

1865.519 --> 1872.809
states of minds then it may be like a

1867.649 --> 1876.32
transformer it may change your angle to

1872.809 --> 1877.9089999999999
things because of the influence it has

1876.32 --> 1880.1589999999999
on your consciousness on what it is

1877.909 --> 1890.3300000000002
actually you're seeing and what it means

1880.159 --> 1892.8490000000002
to you because of where you are I have

1890.33 --> 1894.9789999999998
no idea beyond the imaginary curve if we

1892.849 --> 1896.979
can train babies with these symbols I

1894.979 --> 1901.039
have no freaking idea

1896.979 --> 1903.909
Huna I wouldn't I'm not for that I'm for

1901.039 --> 1913.269
natural bringing of infants with

1903.909 --> 1913.269
breastfeeding no vaccines and yeah

1918.23 --> 1924.4
no I'm not for conditioning of children

1922.07 --> 1930.1699999999998
of any kind of any type really

1924.4 --> 1932.39
so who knows if people what black

1930.17 --> 1934.52
projects are out there trying to try

1932.39 --> 1937.46
this out trying to make warlocks other

1934.52 --> 1942.02
babies or something who knows what's

1937.46 --> 1944.03
going on out there but I have

1942.02 --> 1948.59
experienced personally that symbols can

1944.03 --> 1951.35
definitely have influences but it's

1948.59 --> 1954.79
basically just an influence on the mind

1951.35 --> 1954.79
through reflection

1963.43 --> 1971.49
Wow Dell gets really really pissy today

1967.57 --> 1971.49
isn't he sheesh

1976.02 --> 1984.69
that's ridiculous why would I use a

1980.04 --> 1989.01
symbol to get a woman and besides I wear

1984.69 --> 1991.29
this ring when I go out and you better

1989.01 --> 1993.12
believe that I'll bring it up when I

1991.29 --> 1996.75
actually find a woman that I find

1993.12 --> 2004.7299999999998
interesting and worth engaging with so

1996.75 --> 2006.62
yeah in that sense yeah I do use my

2004.73 --> 2010.91
symbols and my knowledge especially I

2006.62 --> 2013.61
mostly just use my knowledge to try find

2010.91 --> 2018.5900000000001
a right angle to impress a girl because

2013.61 --> 2023.6599999999999
that is very easy to me the less easy

2018.59 --> 2026.72
part is finding compatibility for my own

2023.66 --> 2029.27
personal feeling life which is kind of

2026.72 --> 2032.0
separate from my intellect that's much

2029.27 --> 2038.6
harder to find something for that works

2032.0 --> 2041.69
and also partially due to my my yeah

2038.6 --> 2043.28
overall perception quality and through

2041.69 --> 2049.429
yeah what I've experienced with

2043.28 --> 2054.669
ex-girlfriends I kind of have a high

2049.429 --> 2058.09
standard like unreasonably high like

2054.669 --> 2061.1
inconveniently high and I can't help

2058.09 --> 2066.98
it's just very hard for me to really

2061.1 --> 2069.5899999999997
fall in love with a girl but it's

2066.98 --> 2072.78
definitely not impossible

2069.59 --> 2072.78
[Music]

2079.79 --> 2085.85
[Music]

2082.8 --> 2088.92
dark behaviors

2085.85 --> 2088.92
[Music]

2089.94 --> 2092.4500000000003
yeah

2097.42 --> 2104.799
why are you so interested in all dark

2100.269 --> 2108.9399999999996
behaviors though I kind of personally

2104.799 --> 2111.97
like to avoid them I'm not gonna try to

2108.94 --> 2113.799
pretend they don't exist out there but I

2111.97 --> 2119.7099999999996
like to keep them out of my conscience

2113.799 --> 2121.779
as much much as I can and I find people

2119.71 --> 2123.91
that are constantly dealing with that

2121.779 --> 2126.88
tend to become obsessed with it and then

2123.91 --> 2131.74
so used to it that it becomes like a bad

2126.88 --> 2134.109
addiction so I hope you're not falling

2131.74 --> 2137.9199999999996
into that category of people though that

2134.109 --> 2143.98
would be really sad because I don't know

2137.92 --> 2146.71
anyone that has done that especially of

2143.98 --> 2149.589
a certain age over a certain age that

2146.71 --> 2152.289
are happy people they always become more

2149.589 --> 2156.359
miserable as they get older so I don't

2152.289 --> 2156.3590000000004
want to wish that for you my friend

2166.94 --> 2179.5
well dark behavior is just it's I try to

2176.079 --> 2182.0
approach it more from a frequency thing

2179.5 --> 2184.099
so dark behavior could be all kinds of

2182.0 --> 2188.24
thing it could be like virtue signaling

2184.099 --> 2189.1400000000003
to the extreme anti-human left behavior

2188.24 --> 2194.049
type thing

2189.14 --> 2194.049
that's dark behavior in my opinion or

2194.17 --> 2199.579
trying to teach unnatural things to very

2197.569 --> 2205.19
small children i think thats dark

2199.579 --> 2207.349
behavior and well the obvious worse you

2205.19 --> 2210.799
know i don't even want to say all that

2207.349 --> 2213.92
[Â __Â ] but yeah it can get pretty freakin

2210.799 --> 2219.14
horrific potentially and that's of

2213.92 --> 2221.9
course dark behavior or way beyond but

2219.14 --> 2222.23
dark behavior could also be just I don't

2221.9 --> 2225.799
know

2222.23 --> 2228.44
in a way I'm starting to just also get a

2225.799 --> 2232.13
feel that some women for example are

2228.44 --> 2235.789
just so drunk on their own glory and

2232.13 --> 2240.039
beauty that they are afraid to lose it

2235.789 --> 2245.0190000000002
and that's kind of keeping them from

2240.039 --> 2248.69
engaging in settling down in the family

2245.019 --> 2250.7299999999996
so they'll just escaped from boyfriend

2248.69 --> 2252.92
the boyfriend probably or try to fool

2250.73 --> 2254.42
around play around with them because

2252.92 --> 2257.029
they're just so beautiful

2254.42 --> 2259.25
they'll be bothered with their beauty

2257.029 --> 2260.69
anyway or they have to really attempt to

2259.25 --> 2262.309
hide it and they're not going to do that

2260.69 --> 2265.789
because they also enjoy it but at the

2262.309 --> 2269.17
same time it is keeping them addicted to

2265.789 --> 2273.65
that state that state of affairs

2269.17 --> 2277.46
literally and discouraging them from

2273.65 --> 2279.65
settling down and just learn to become

2277.46 --> 2283.789
older and wiser and have children and

2279.65 --> 2287.359
all that and that in a way could also be

2283.789 --> 2291.5190000000002
considered dark behavior all depends it

2287.359 --> 2291.519
all depends on how far they will take it

2293.21 --> 2298.61
but I I don't like that this happens

2301.61 --> 2304.61
what

2307.78 --> 2310.5600000000004
No

2317.28 --> 2320.09
right

2320.22 --> 2327.89
okay Dell well thank you for that I I

2328.4 --> 2335.04
don't think you'll really have to write

2331.23 --> 2337.23
to talk about it about any of my past

2335.04 --> 2339.319
relationships in that manner because you

2337.23 --> 2342.54
have absolutely no idea what I was like

2339.319 --> 2346.589
and I lived with my ex-girlfriend it was

2342.54 --> 2349.44
like the first time actually lived with

2346.589 --> 2351.569
a girlfriend for three years and was

2349.44 --> 2354.839
most amazing time of my life it truly

2351.569 --> 2359.4
was at least that's how I experienced it

2354.839 --> 2362.39
it wasn't perfect and I definitely

2359.4 --> 2365.76
bumped into some of my own flaws that

2362.39 --> 2370.7999999999997
also contributed in ruining that

2365.76 --> 2375.42
relationship it was not just me but I'm

2370.8 --> 2378.869
not gonna basically try to expose

2375.42 --> 2383.52
whatever character flaw she has because

2378.869 --> 2387.96
I don't wanna you know she chose her

2383.52 --> 2390.18
path and yeah besides she didn't really

2387.96 --> 2392.9700000000003
want to have children from the get-go

2390.18 --> 2394.5299999999997
and I kind of stuck around hoping that I

2392.97 --> 2396.1189999999997
would get her that far but she was

2394.53 --> 2400.28
pretty damn persistent and that is

2396.119 --> 2400.28
probably the biggest blow of it all

2404.17 --> 2407.71
so yeah

2413.98 --> 2422.95
but yeah del sorry but if you'd been

2419.98 --> 2425.98
there like especially the first year

2422.95 --> 2431.6499999999996
when I was with my ex and we would go to

2425.98 --> 2434.22
like public situations you'd been there

2431.65 --> 2437.2000000000003
you'd be looking and you'd be hurt

2434.22 --> 2439.66
because that was freaking beautiful and

2437.2 --> 2441.3289999999997
I still have some photographs but I'm

2439.66 --> 2444.94
not gonna share them in public like that

2441.329 --> 2447.76
but yeah I doubt it

2444.94 --> 2451.9
I doubt that you've ever experienced

2447.76 --> 2454.3900000000003
anything like that in your life and I

2451.9 --> 2457.53
doubt that you ever will although maybe

2454.39 --> 2457.5299999999997
you have in the past

2459.0 --> 2463.75
that probably bypassed you completely

2461.77 --> 2467.02
while I was full aware that what was

2463.75 --> 2469.0
going on and they also had a forefront

2467.02 --> 2473.23
fear like this is gonna end at some time

2469.0 --> 2475.42
like knew it and but I I hid that from

2473.23 --> 2479.89
myself because I was so glorious I just

2475.42 --> 2485.53
didn't want it to end and I hope that I

2479.89 --> 2487.42
could switch over to her to a family and

2485.53 --> 2491.369
that didn't work out at all

2487.42 --> 2491.369
so yeah it is what it is

2497.94 --> 2504.42
well that's that's kind of demeaning

2501.73 --> 2512.53
trolls versus trolls but I understand

2504.42 --> 2514.48
look it's very complicated because she

2512.53 --> 2517.63
was so beautiful

2514.48 --> 2521.25
in ways what I looked for also for

2517.63 --> 2525.2200000000003
character for demeanor for dynamic

2521.25 --> 2527.32
ability to respond to things for even

2525.22 --> 2531.22
her acting capabilities very subtle

2527.32 --> 2537.369
things all that combined she was

2531.22 --> 2546.8799999999997
absolutely a9 absolutely incredible the

2537.369 --> 2550.32
talent but I know if you judge purely by

2546.88 --> 2552.88
beauty then yeah she was not the

2550.32 --> 2557.349
prettiest of all she was freaking

2552.88 --> 2559.9900000000002
beautiful really she was like but she

2557.349 --> 2562.81
wasn't like absolutely perfect and she

2559.99 --> 2565.39
knew that but I was blah you'd still

2562.81 --> 2568.72
she's a person that especially if she's

2565.39 --> 2571.23
in a good mood you'll notice when she

2568.72 --> 2574.23
enters the room I did every single time

2571.23 --> 2574.23
so

2583.08 --> 2598.95
okay stop watching porn Adele yeah sex

2595.99 --> 2605.2299999999996
is really awesome and you can definitely

2598.95 --> 2607.75
get some peaks with that but I really

2605.23 --> 2612.369
wanted that because I wanted to create a

2607.75 --> 2615.22
magical child basically with that energy

2612.369 --> 2617.1400000000003
with that focus that's what it really

2615.22 --> 2619.1189999999997
what that's what really drove me to

2617.14 --> 2621.79
those Peaks to be able to uphold that

2619.119 --> 2624.369
and as soon as that stopped as soon as I

2621.79 --> 2627.46
really figured out that she really

2624.369 --> 2631.63
didn't want it and I was not going to be

2627.46 --> 2633.52
able to convince her it's almost and not

2631.63 --> 2636.57
completely what it was almost that I

2633.52 --> 2639.07
just became important not like totally

2636.57 --> 2642.28
but I just didn't have that energy

2639.07 --> 2644.55
anymore it's just like yeah it's no more

2642.28 --> 2644.55
use

2648.55 --> 2652.7200000000003
I don't know it's always been there I've

2650.68 --> 2655.18
never been a guy like oh yeah I want to

2652.72 --> 2658.2099999999996
keep on [Â __Â ] your [Â __Â ] and like

2655.18 --> 2661.54
dumpster pumping as as Owen Benjamin

2658.21 --> 2664.78
says I never really wanted that it's

2661.54 --> 2668.97
always been about I want love I want

2664.78 --> 2668.9700000000003
that connection I want a magic I want

2669.72 --> 2676.68
the bring in a new spirit in the world

2672.97 --> 2682.6299999999997
that is attuned to us and that I can

2676.68 --> 2685.33
help overcome its issues much better

2682.63 --> 2687.4300000000003
much clearer probably than my parents

2685.33 --> 2691.99
ever were able to even though they did

2687.43 --> 2694.8689999999997
pretty okay but I think that I can

2691.99 --> 2696.7299999999996
definitely do better just with the sheer

2694.869 --> 2701.65
knowledge it's probably more gonna turn

2696.73 --> 2703.66
out to be like that I might risk over

2701.65 --> 2706.78
filling them with talk and that they'll

2703.66 --> 2708.8199999999997
be like yeah yeah dad blah blah blah so

2706.78 --> 2711.9
I have to like be careful with how much

2708.82 --> 2714.46
I'm not gonna have much I'm not gonna

2711.9 --> 2716.619
I'm gonna have to make sure not to end

2714.46 --> 2718.9900000000002
up in a situation with my children where

2716.619 --> 2721.78
I'm literally gonna use my children to

2718.99 --> 2724.6299999999997
just do my talking because that's gonna

2721.78 --> 2726.76
overwhelm them I'm yeah don't want to do

2724.63 --> 2729.4
that I'd a gonna have to naturally

2726.76 --> 2733.21
deploy and then when would they feel

2729.4 --> 2737.14
that the the gust of the mind wind

2733.21 --> 2740.02
coming in probably between there they're

2737.14 --> 2742.42
10 and they're 12 somewhere that's what

2740.02 --> 2744.79
happened with me then I'll be ready

2742.42 --> 2748.03
they're almost like in the Flat Earth

2744.79 --> 2750.13
debates I'll be ready there to take that

2748.03 --> 2752.17
wind and to give a direction and to

2750.13 --> 2757.38
teach them how to deal with that energy

2752.17 --> 2757.38
I can't wait for it I really want kids

2765.42 --> 2772.12
ya know but I'm doing fine

2768.58 --> 2774.31
look the whole thing about the whole set

2772.12 --> 2776.29
up and wasn't even an issue with my ex

2774.31 --> 2779.7999999999997
and it is still an issue to this day is

2776.29 --> 2782.86
really the financial security and I've

2779.8 --> 2785.44
never been properly to fix that for

2782.86 --> 2789.61
myself to myself to my own satisfaction

2785.44 --> 2793.0
and I'm now at least being very serious

2789.61 --> 2795.01
and about it not trying to act like a

2793.0 --> 2798.27
teenager like oh it's not my fault

2795.01 --> 2801.46
because that stuck to me very long I

2798.27 --> 2803.73
basically neurotically refused the

2801.46 --> 2808.6
responsibility for my own financial

2803.73 --> 2811.21
inabilities because it was so painful so

2808.6 --> 2813.19
it was too painful to realize for a long

2811.21 --> 2816.07
time yeah now that's personal though

2813.19 --> 2818.38
that is that is honesty see how many

2816.07 --> 2821.5
people would actually say that about

2818.38 --> 2825.9700000000003
themselves okay I was like that but I

2821.5 --> 2829.39
know it now and I'm putting it out there

2825.97 --> 2831.8199999999997
because I now have a view a vision a

2829.39 --> 2833.7999999999997
hope that I'm not certainly gonna die

2831.82 --> 2837.73
and it's all gonna be over so there's no

2833.8 --> 2840.67
use investing in that but that I'm gonna

2837.73 --> 2843.76
have a period to basically develop all

2840.67 --> 2846.01
this stuff much more focused than before

2843.76 --> 2849.1800000000003
because I can focus now I can actually

2846.01 --> 2851.92
steer myself in two directions and then

2849.18 --> 2853.81
continue developing just because I'm

2851.92 --> 2856.21
almost 40 doesn't mean I can have to

2853.81 --> 2859.99
stop learning I don't feel like I will

2856.21 --> 2862.51
be stopping the wave the mind wave

2859.99 --> 2866.79
anytime soon and at that mentally I

2862.51 --> 2869.9700000000003
still feel like I'm I'm just in my 20s I

2866.79 --> 2869.97
really do

2871.94 --> 2877.619
so I have hope now and now I am fixing

2876.0 --> 2879.839
everything I'm gonna fix everything

2877.619 --> 2881.94
about myself if you want to fix the

2879.839 --> 2887.94
world start with yourself and then when

2881.94 --> 2889.829
you fix yourself you will know what you

2887.94 --> 2891.9900000000002
should be doing in the world what you

2889.829 --> 2895.53
should be fixing and what you should not

2891.99 --> 2900.5389999999998
be fixing because other people need to

2895.53 --> 2902.099
learn to fix it themselves and that's

2900.539 --> 2904.079
what are the things that people that

2902.099 --> 2906.119
don't fix themselves just can't see

2904.079 --> 2908.9700000000003
because they don't understand the

2906.119 --> 2911.46
progress of the learning of your

2908.97 --> 2912.45
mistakes they don't they're not they

2911.46 --> 2914.64
haven't done it yet they're still

2912.45 --> 2917.3999999999996
avoiding it so they don't understand the

2914.64 --> 2924.44
necessity of this spiritual cycle people

2917.4 --> 2928.049
go through its choice

2924.44 --> 2930.089
it's the lessons of God that we need to

2928.049 --> 2934.349
learn that's part of why we're here and

2930.089 --> 2937.89
that's very tough for a young individual

2934.349 --> 2941.7000000000003
to accept and much much easier for an

2937.89 --> 2944.48
older individual that has actually fixed

2941.7 --> 2944.48
their problems

2953.7 --> 2961.5789999999997
having some real sensory problems though

2956.67 --> 2961.579
if you think that this is dark behavior

2966.59 --> 2976.56
[Music]

2967.94 --> 2979.71
anyway oh really

2976.56 --> 2987.0
really Dell I don't well that's wrong I

2979.71 --> 2990.0
do I do have yeah at least three very

2987.0 --> 2994.32
solid friends very solid friends that

2990.0 --> 2999.06
includes my dad which I have an amazing

2994.32 --> 3001.9100000000003
relationship with that if you compare it

2999.06 --> 3004.75
to how it used to be when I think about

3001.91 --> 3008.2999999999997
it sometimes it sounds kind of weird I

3004.75 --> 3012.32
almost have to cry because I would never

3008.3 --> 3015.65
believe he it could be become turn out

3012.32 --> 3019.55
to be this good when I was younger

3015.65 --> 3022.34
okay because I hated my dad because he

3019.55 --> 3024.44
was a coward and he's not a coward

3022.34 --> 3027.65
anymore and he's become very wise and

3024.44 --> 3029.54
totally happy about it and he is so

3027.65 --> 3032.0
generous that I just can't believe it

3029.54 --> 3033.8
sometimes okay I can't believe I feel

3032.0 --> 3039.65
like I don't deserve a dad like this and

3033.8 --> 3043.9
he is a good friend as well so there's

3039.65 --> 3046.2200000000003
that wonder if you have that Dell I

3043.9 --> 3049.36
don't have a mother anymore by the way

3046.22 --> 3054.41
I haven't for a long time since 2006 and

3049.36 --> 3058.6400000000003
then there's my transsexual friend I

3054.41 --> 3062.48
love to say it just just because I know

3058.64 --> 3066.2599999999998
what we'll do but I've known her who

3062.48 --> 3071.42
used to be a heat in the 80s and she's

3066.26 --> 3074.05
now think almost 60 maybe in her 60s and

3071.42 --> 3078.26
I've known her and talked to her for

3074.05 --> 3083.02
hundreds of hours maybe thousands in the

3078.26 --> 3087.98
last decade yeah

3083.02 --> 3090.65
2009 yeah and she knows everything about

3087.98 --> 3092.98
me and she I know everything about her

3090.65 --> 3098.2400000000002
and the issues and I've learned

3092.98 --> 3102.11
incredible much about what it is to be

3098.24 --> 3106.16
like that and what drove her to actually

3102.11 --> 3108.71
do that back then it is very very

3106.16 --> 3111.02
complicated surreal and there's

3108.71 --> 3114.59
definitely issues it's not like she is a

3111.02 --> 3117.1
fanatical left is absolutely not very

3114.59 --> 3120.4700000000003
wise person oh my god the knowledge

3117.1 --> 3123.65
she's a librarian okay it's been a

3120.47 --> 3127.16
library in all our life and she can just

3123.65 --> 3129.98
drag out books from one culture after

3127.16 --> 3133.64
another referencing the most incredible

3129.98 --> 3136.34
historical things every single time and

3133.64 --> 3138.62
it's almost drives me to tears because

3136.34 --> 3142.52
it's so beautiful she has such a vast

3138.62 --> 3144.49
library of knowledge and she's extremely

3142.52 --> 3147.41
happy she said this to me with me

3144.49 --> 3151.52
because I'm one of the few people that

3147.41 --> 3153.98
literally drag that out of her and that

3151.52 --> 3159.47
can actually appreciate the glory of it

3153.98 --> 3161.75
and she's not a like a rich person she

3159.47 --> 3163.64
has definitely issued very loyal to a

3161.75 --> 3166.46
friend and everything and she's also

3163.64 --> 3168.8599999999997
financially helped me way back when it

3166.46 --> 3170.84
was in serious psychological disarray

3168.86 --> 3173.81
way before the Flat Earth shows and all

3170.84 --> 3177.01
that like right when we me and my ex

3173.81 --> 3180.67
broke up she helped me just with money

3177.01 --> 3182.51
just when I didn't even ask for it and

3180.67 --> 3184.2200000000003
incredible friend okay

3182.51 --> 3186.7400000000002
and that's number two now here comes

3184.22 --> 3189.9199999999996
number three there's a girl that I

3186.74 --> 3193.49
actually had a relationship with when I

3189.92 --> 3196.31
was doing my goldsmithing study and they

3193.49 --> 3198.9799999999996
kind of went wrong it was weird but she

3196.31 --> 3204.5
has a kid now and we've been like a

3198.98 --> 3208.3
phone friend forever and just she is a

3204.5 --> 3210.62
mother and she has just this crazy life

3208.3 --> 3212.63
but she's always trying to be

3210.62 --> 3215.42
responsible and do it right and things

3212.63 --> 3216.9500000000003
still go completely chaotic also because

3215.42 --> 3219.7400000000002
she has a tendency to just

3216.95 --> 3222.68
be overly tolerant towards certain

3219.74 --> 3226.22
people like for example really trollish

3222.68 --> 3227.6299999999997
people in in chat she has this weird

3226.22 --> 3229.52
habit of falling in love with those

3227.63 --> 3232.1600000000003
types of people and then trying to fix

3229.52 --> 3233.84
them and she's getting better at I've

3232.16 --> 3235.64
actually been giving her advice because

3233.84 --> 3239.6600000000003
she's not gonna stop doing it

3235.64 --> 3243.95
so I just do that with her and she also

3239.66 --> 3246.41
gives me a financial backup in the sense

3243.95 --> 3248.75
that I can lend money from her in a

3246.41 --> 3251.45
second and I'll always pay it back

3248.75 --> 3254.54
because she has it she just had happens

3251.45 --> 3256.85
to be lucky right now had an inheritance

3254.54 --> 3259.79
from her mom which is a lot of struggle

3256.85 --> 3263.0
so she will she's not lucky she had a

3259.79 --> 3266.57
lot of struggle in her life and she's

3263.0 --> 3269.15
been very wise in realising what to do

3266.57 --> 3272.03
with her money also because I've

3269.15 --> 3274.94
experienced this before her and I've

3272.03 --> 3277.88
reflected to her how I made mistakes

3274.94 --> 3280.85
with it and she's really wise with it

3277.88 --> 3283.52
now and also because of that she's just

3280.85 --> 3286.2799999999997
lending me money if I need it in the

3283.52 --> 3289.07
spot but I'm not gonna like stay in that

3286.28 --> 3290.7200000000003
with her like I I refuse to do that no

3289.07 --> 3293.3
matter what but if it's like an

3290.72 --> 3296.27
emergency I can do it now that's a

3293.3 --> 3303.77
friend okay how many super good friends

3296.27 --> 3306.65
do you have though I'd like to hear how

3303.77 --> 3308.48
many friends do you have that could

3306.65 --> 3315.34
compare to any of these three people

3308.48 --> 3315.34
that I just mentioned exactly

3319.699 --> 3322.969
that's right

3324.72 --> 3328.0389999999998
I believe you are

3332.269 --> 3339.1989999999996
but yeah complaining about it's not

3336.919 --> 3344.899
gonna help anyone the only way to find

3339.199 --> 3347.7490000000003
friends is to do new things let yourself

3344.899 --> 3349.429
in new groups and then go through all

3347.749 --> 3351.439
that [Â __Â ] again because if you're always

3349.429 --> 3353.119
isolated then doing something new

3351.439 --> 3355.459
getting into new groups is always gonna

3353.119 --> 3357.889
give all that friction again and you'll

3355.459 --> 3360.189
feel very uncomfortable it's extremely

3357.889 --> 3363.7090000000003
annoying I know everything about it

3360.189 --> 3366.859
I've a weakness with that with me it

3363.709 --> 3369.769
hits very hard I hate it but you have to

3366.859 --> 3373.159
do it it's the only way to find new

3369.769 --> 3375.0789999999997
roads to find new people that you really

3373.159 --> 3378.219
could put that could help potentially

3375.079 --> 3383.299
change you adjust by meeting them and

3378.219 --> 3387.4990000000003
give you a new direction to walk at find

3383.299 --> 3390.349
a better purpose for yourself and then

3387.499 --> 3392.749
see what you can learn in that in the

3390.349 --> 3399.529
new path you're taking it's the only way

3392.749 --> 3401.109
to do it what's no I'm not rejecting you

3399.529 --> 3404.539
are you listening

3401.109 --> 3408.049
I'm literally giving you good advice

3404.539 --> 3410.3190000000004
here advice that I would take if I were

3408.049 --> 3410.319
you

3422.91 --> 3431.5499999999997
no I'm not talking down to you I just

3426.9 --> 3434.79
said if I were you I would do that and I

3431.55 --> 3436.26
have and I explained why why why would

3434.79 --> 3438.66
that be talking down I'm literally

3436.26 --> 3440.5200000000004
trying to give you advice I'm not

3438.66 --> 3444.39
telling you you're stupid because you

3440.52 --> 3447.09
have this because I have it and I just

3444.39 --> 3450.5099999999998
know how that works and if you really

3447.09 --> 3452.31
feel stuck and you don't have great

3450.51 --> 3455.6000000000004
friends on which you can fall back you

3452.31 --> 3460.0499999999997
gotta have you gotta have to move and

3455.6 --> 3462.18
touch new energies new people expands

3460.05 --> 3464.13
that's the only way you can ever find

3462.18 --> 3466.1099999999997
real friends it's not gonna work over

3464.13 --> 3468.81
you internet never really does you can

3466.11 --> 3471.09
find colleagues people you can rely on

3468.81 --> 3473.43
do you think I have found some of these

3471.09 --> 3476.78
people but it's still different it's

3473.43 --> 3481.44
very different to people you get to know

3476.78 --> 3483.5400000000004
naturally face-to-face yeah touch new

3481.44 --> 3486.66
energies people have an energy field

3483.54 --> 3489.69
around them when people combine in a

3486.66 --> 3492.42
room the combination of them sets an

3489.69 --> 3495.54
atmosphere has an energy that's the

3492.42 --> 3497.4900000000002
energies of people and you got to expose

3495.54 --> 3499.77
yourself to those energies and when you

3497.49 --> 3501.93
isolate yourself in a single room or in

3499.77 --> 3504.48
a basement or whatever then you don't

3501.93 --> 3507.18
get exposed to new energies the energy

3504.48 --> 3511.11
field that you feel is only your own

3507.18 --> 3513.87
that's very safe it may help you on the

3511.11 --> 3514.8900000000003
short run to concentrate but if you stay

3513.87 --> 3518.1
there too long

3514.89 --> 3520.7999999999997
then you'll start to feel isolated feel

3518.1 --> 3523.44
lonely potentially get nervous side

3520.8 --> 3527.1600000000003
effects from it and that can lead to

3523.44 --> 3529.98
paranoia that's just natural that that

3527.16 --> 3531.12
happens it's not a psychological

3529.98 --> 3538.05
weakness that's just a natural

3531.12 --> 3541.7599999999998
consequence of doing that no energy is

3538.05 --> 3541.76
not Jesus del

3550.09 --> 3557.94
I'm just gonna enjoy the Zeppo hmm

3566.7 --> 3569.359
okay

3573.77 --> 3580.36
hmm okay not as sweet as the other one

3577.52 --> 3585.14
the other ones that I had before a

3580.36 --> 3588.17
little bit more sour and I can even feel

3585.14 --> 3589.79
that a little my teeth so yeah it's not

3588.17 --> 3592.9700000000003
gonna be a favorite app of mine but it's

3589.79 --> 3600.47
decent and it's juicy it's a good Apple

3592.97 --> 3603.79
Cheers mmm although no flatlander nathan

3600.47 --> 3603.79
is not live that's a premiere

3607.02 --> 3610.17
[Music]

3613.4 --> 3616.9390000000003
[Applause]

3655.18 --> 3658.23
oh wait

3676.97 --> 3686.02
mm-hmm ah yeah I've been going for an

3682.46 --> 3689.18
hour I could still go on a little longer

3686.02 --> 3693.29
I'm totally fine with me it's 45

3689.18 --> 3698.4199999999996
watching right now hope you're enjoying

3693.29 --> 3702.8
the show so far my my bit of personal

3698.42 --> 3706.19
advice concerning loneliness and the

3702.8 --> 3707.9900000000002
consequences it kind of addressed to

3706.19 --> 3710.0
beyond the imaginary curve here was

3707.99 --> 3712.16
being very trollish and sarcastic with

3710.0 --> 3714.26
everything because it probably feels

3712.16 --> 3719.66
like I'm exposing him in public so he's

3714.26 --> 3722.9900000000002
trying to act like I'm totally off but

3719.66 --> 3725.089
that's fine as long as he remembers it

3722.99 --> 3727.49
and takes it to heart that's all good

3725.089 --> 3731.29
and it's also addressed to anyone else

3727.49 --> 3737.29
out there that has loneliness issues and

3731.29 --> 3740.0
difficulty getting to know people and

3737.29 --> 3745.39
yeah people that have a hard time

3740.0 --> 3745.39
finding really good friends it's tough

3751.26 --> 3756.6400000000003
yeah beyond the imaginary curve it's

3753.91 --> 3758.7999999999997
about friendship remember the three

3756.64 --> 3761.44
examples of really good friends

3758.8 --> 3764.71
including my own dad to which you

3761.44 --> 3767.29
responded that you didn't have that so

3764.71 --> 3772.3
it's not about a spouse it's not about

3767.29 --> 3776.17
wealth financial wealth right it's about

3772.3 --> 3778.0600000000004
having friendship the ability to really

3776.17 --> 3781.119
fall back on somebody when you really

3778.06 --> 3800.0499999999997
need it talking about that that's what

3781.119 --> 3802.9900000000002
my advice is about there's a projection

3800.05 --> 3806.67
if I've ever read one if you want to be

3802.99 --> 3806.6699999999996
sad do as our windows

3811.339 --> 3817.999
who says I'm sad I'm pretty happy with

3815.569 --> 3824.169
my situation I'm happy with myself are

3817.999 --> 3827.4489999999996
you happy where I'm going I have hope a

3824.169 --> 3831.0789999999997
few I have my health that I've invested

3827.449 --> 3835.369
a great deal in and that is now starting

3831.079 --> 3839.4190000000003
to really pay off more and more I'm not

3835.369 --> 3841.069
sad at all I think you're kinda sad why

3839.419 --> 3843.979
else would you be so negative all the

3841.069 --> 3845.869
time why else would you even just say

3843.979 --> 3850.1299999999997
yeah I don't really have really good

3845.869 --> 3853.179
friends you think that not having really

3850.13 --> 3856.179
good friends makes people more happy

3853.179 --> 3856.179
Dell

3863.26 --> 3867.94
well Dell we could be friends that don't

3865.81 --> 3872.38
necessarily need to be pen pals that's

3867.94 --> 3874.359
the we both have YouTube channels but in

3872.38 --> 3877.6
order for us to be friends you're gonna

3874.359 --> 3880.99
have to conform a little to my standards

3877.6 --> 3883.72
or it's not gonna work out and your

3880.99 --> 3886.5699999999997
behavior is all over the place too far

3883.72 --> 3889.27
and when people correct you you don't

3886.57 --> 3892.6600000000003
accept it you actually attack them and

3889.27 --> 3897.73
that's a type of behavior that is above

3892.66 --> 3899.52
my yeah above my tolerance limit so

3897.73 --> 3901.75
unless you're gonna deal with that and

3899.52 --> 3904.56
kind of doubt you will because she's

3901.75 --> 3907.57
doing exactly this for a long time then

3904.56 --> 3910.2599999999998
friendship I don't know we look I'm not

3907.57 --> 3912.7000000000003
gonna attack you might just appear

3910.26 --> 3914.71
whatever we could do something together

3912.7 --> 3919.5099999999998
have a hangout just on the fling I

3914.71 --> 3924.21
wouldn't mind that but to say okay yeah

3919.51 --> 3924.21
we're gonna be buddies nod sorry

3952.06 --> 3961.6
I'm pretty sure that I've gotten to know

3955.56 --> 3965.41
enough of you they'll the way you talk

3961.6 --> 3965.97
life on your show the way you talk in

3965.41 --> 3971.14
chat

3965.97 --> 3972.27
that's giving a pretty good read out as

3971.14 --> 3975.3799999999997
to what drives you

3972.27 --> 3975.38
[Music]

3981.57 --> 3987.0
look there's not a lot of things you

3983.76 --> 3991.1600000000003
could keep secret that would gravely

3987.0 --> 3991.16
alter my perception of who you are

3996.39 --> 4003.67
I thought you could definitely make

3998.94 --> 4003.67
things worse but I wouldn't do that

4019.37 --> 4032.46
this you check oh I don't know maybe

4029.01 --> 4035.8500000000004
Dell just has some unresolved like gay

4032.46 --> 4040.23
feelings then that are pestering ya

4035.85 --> 4042.15
getting in his way you know I tend to do

4040.23 --> 4047.79
that with more people have experienced a

4042.15 --> 4055.11
lot of men just turning or yeah going

4047.79 --> 4057.0299999999997
more gay than usual in my presence so I

4055.11 --> 4059.01
wouldn't be surprised but I'm not gonna

4057.03 --> 4064.46
just say okay he's doing that this

4059.01 --> 4064.46
because he's gay could simply be jealous

4080.16 --> 4087.29
you know

4082.77 --> 4087.29
okay don't get to pervy now Casey Jones

4088.58 --> 4094.38
no I'm not calling you gay Dell I'm just

4092.19 --> 4099.24
saying look it's a lot of men out there

4094.38 --> 4101.16
that still have these weird unresolved

4099.24 --> 4102.7789999999995
feelings towards men that they don't

4101.16 --> 4104.91
really know what to do with them they

4102.779 --> 4107.67
don't know how to build something a

4104.91 --> 4108.99
social construct in their behavior and

4107.67 --> 4112.259
how to deal with them and that can

4108.99 --> 4114.96
result into thinking that might be some

4112.259 --> 4116.97
kind of gayness there it will pop up at

4114.96 --> 4118.529
an expected moments toward certain

4116.97 --> 4121.17
individuals that will bring it out in

4118.529 --> 4124.259
yeah I've seen it happen and maybe you

4121.17 --> 4126.18
have this too that would explain a few

4124.259 --> 4129.08
things but I'm not claiming that that is

4126.18 --> 4129.08
absolutely the case

4145.639 --> 4148.27
Wow

4171.63 --> 4179.9490000000005
so hey dough when sliced the last time

4175.569 --> 4182.88
you've done some Street activism because

4179.949 --> 4186.759
some time ago you were doing that and

4182.88 --> 4188.859
you were really respected for it because

4186.759 --> 4191.469
you did quite a good job we thought

4188.859 --> 4193.56
we're in France right and Scotland and

4191.469 --> 4197.619
doing that why don't you do that again

4193.56 --> 4200.2300000000005
because then you will get outside you

4197.619 --> 4201.969
will actually bump into new people and

4200.23 --> 4204.759999999999
who knows you might find some really

4201.969 --> 4206.889
interesting new people that could be

4204.76 --> 4208.570000000001
really good friends at some point so why

4206.889 --> 4210.07
don't you just do that again instead of

4208.57 --> 4214.239
just hanging around in your basement all

4210.07 --> 4216.28
the time you know you already know how

4214.239 --> 4218.5
to do it you've done it before so why

4216.28 --> 4221.099
wouldn't you just do that again just go

4218.5 --> 4224.369
with something that's then it will work

4221.099 --> 4224.369000000001
so go

4241.98 --> 4248.759999999999
well who knows maybe you can find a good

4245.25 --> 4251.46
friend like Riley that'll actually be

4248.76 --> 4254.46
okay with the overall way you conduct

4251.46 --> 4257.88
yourself who knows you know maybe some

4254.46 --> 4261.96
