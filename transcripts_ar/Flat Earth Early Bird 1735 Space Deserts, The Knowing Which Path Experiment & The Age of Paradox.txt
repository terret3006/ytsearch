[Music]

50.6 --> 56.0
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

54.12 --> 59.76
bird number

56.0 --> 61.44
1735 I'm your host arwyn and before I

59.76 --> 63.899
start the show please don't forget to

61.44 --> 66.72
share it on any platform you deem fit

63.899 --> 69.24
and if you haven't already subscribe to

66.72 --> 71.46
my channel hit the Bell notification so

69.24 --> 73.91999999999999
you know when I'm going live which is

71.46 --> 76.67999999999999
normally 1pm Amsterdam time in weekdays

73.92 --> 79.02
and 2PM Amsterdam time in a weekend and

76.68 --> 81.119
please also do support me through the

79.02 --> 83.759
PayPal and the patreon that we much

81.119 --> 87.78
appreciated and it can really use the

83.759 --> 91.82
support so please keep it coming

87.78 --> 91.82000000000001
right so the weather

92.28 --> 97.68
oh right now it's really cloudy it was

94.799 --> 100.43900000000001
really sunny before this

97.68 --> 101.82000000000001
up until like 15 minutes ago and then

100.439 --> 105.67999999999999
this

101.82 --> 105.67999999999999
giant Cloud just moved over

106.439 --> 112.03999999999999
it's really standing out how little wind

108.659 --> 112.04
there is overall

114.299 --> 119.399
today

116.04 --> 123.43900000000001
this is like really wind still

119.399 --> 123.43900000000001
plants are doing great

124.2 --> 128.64000000000001
I still have to give them water because

126.06 --> 131.42000000000002
it's not raining a lot despite all the

128.64 --> 131.42
clouds and all that

132.48 --> 139.319
but yeah they're still growing just fine

135.2 --> 143.099
especially the mint still crushing it

139.319 --> 146.54
a big cloud so

143.099 --> 146.54
blocking my son

147.54 --> 155.7
well hopefully they'll be gone in like a

152.22 --> 158.34
15 minutes or maybe 20 I don't know

155.7 --> 160.85999999999999
anyway

158.34 --> 164.58
low into the break first in chat good to

160.86 --> 167.519
see you Terry 306 good to see you

164.58 --> 169.739
it is Saturday the 30th of September

167.519 --> 173.0
2023

169.739 --> 173.0
temperature dipped there

174.84 --> 178.519
hmm

175.98 --> 178.51899999999998
all right

184.62 --> 187.879
20 degrees Celsius

190.68 --> 196.44
it's not cold

193.5 --> 198.48
right so yeah I feel great today

196.44 --> 201.44
I had a really good dinner yesterday was

198.48 --> 201.44
what's very needed

201.599 --> 204.07999999999998
ah

204.959 --> 209.76
and had a really great interesting

207.48 --> 211.67999999999998
conversation that I thought was being

209.76 --> 212.879
still recorded by Nathan but he wasn't

211.68 --> 214.92000000000002
apparently

212.879 --> 218.04
so I'm gonna have to like bring it up

214.92 --> 220.55999999999997
today I put it in the title

218.04 --> 223.67999999999998
right and that's the knowing witch path

220.56 --> 226.739
experiment like QE

223.68 --> 230.04000000000002
I guess finally managed to explain it to

226.739 --> 232.019
me in a way that I really got it

230.04 --> 235.319
like

232.019 --> 238.31900000000002
it's weird because

235.319 --> 240.42
and he even explained this to me he was

238.319 --> 243.54
basically using the knowing which math

240.42 --> 245.879
experiment all the time to prove the

243.54 --> 248.57999999999998
through knowing that there is God and

245.879 --> 250.739
that is true it's ontological primitive

248.58 --> 252.54000000000002
but the point is is that that made me

250.739 --> 254.84
kind of misunderstand the actual

252.54 --> 256.88
experiment because

254.84 --> 262.28000000000003
here's the thing

256.88 --> 262.28
knowing is not the independent variable

262.32 --> 267.3
and I always thought that because of

264.96 --> 269.88
that because of his strategical

267.3 --> 271.8
explanation but he really explained it

269.88 --> 274.68
to me in detail and it is not actually

271.8 --> 277.199
the knowing that is the independent

274.68 --> 279.68
variable how about that did you guys

277.199 --> 279.68
know that

282.32 --> 287.09999999999997
it is

284.699 --> 289.639
what the actual independent variable is

287.1 --> 289.639
is

290.82 --> 294.59999999999997
information retrievable

294.84 --> 298.34
it has to be like

298.44 --> 305.84
information that has been created and it

302.699 --> 305.84000000000003
has to be retrievable

306.3 --> 311.46000000000004
like at the time of the firing of the

310.32 --> 313.919
device

311.46 --> 316.19899999999996
so like

313.919 --> 319.02
it doesn't even matter if somebody takes

316.199 --> 320.759
a look at it ever

319.02 --> 323.94
it doesn't even matter whether people

320.759 --> 326.94
know whether the information exists or

323.94 --> 329.28
not it only matters that it exists at

326.94 --> 333.06
the time

329.28 --> 335.69899999999996
and that it is retrievable

333.06 --> 337.32
like theoretically as in if there's a

335.699 --> 340.38
code key

337.32 --> 344.039
then that code key must be available to

340.38 --> 346.68
someone so it's like somebody has to be

344.039 --> 348.84
able to retrieve the information even if

346.68 --> 350.40000000000003
nobody knows who that is except for the

348.84 --> 353.15999999999997
person that can

350.4 --> 355.85999999999996
it's really bizarre but

353.16 --> 358.44
it's not the knowing that actually does

355.86 --> 362.28000000000003
the very in manipulating of the of the

358.44 --> 364.74
wave function collapse it's that it is

362.28 --> 367.5
information

364.74 --> 370.199
the existence of the information of the

367.5 --> 373.8
witch path that has to be the existence

370.199 --> 376.02000000000004
of it and that it has to be retrievable

373.8 --> 378.06
if you just write it but it's like at

376.02 --> 382.039
the bottom of a volcano

378.06 --> 382.039
nobody will ever be able to get it

383.16 --> 387.78000000000003
or you don't know where it is it's like

385.62 --> 390.24
deposit the information but it's like

387.78 --> 391.13899999999995
hidden nobody knows where it is then

390.24 --> 393.84000000000003
it's

391.139 --> 396.0
then it's not gonna happen

393.84 --> 397.25899999999996
so is the information and it has to be

396.0 --> 400.22
retrievable

397.259 --> 400.22
how about that

403.199 --> 409.16
hello gamer guy

406.38 --> 409.15999999999997
it's been a while

415.139 --> 422.18
it made a lot of sense body Club this is

418.68 --> 422.18
okay gamer guy

423.36 --> 427.38
I mean when you're on the globe

425.58 --> 431.65999999999997
everything is super convincing it's a

427.38 --> 431.65999999999997
globe even though it's complete nonsense

438.72 --> 443.40000000000003
right so that's the one thing

441.12 --> 446.58
The Knowing witch math experiment I will

443.4 --> 449.099
yeah I'm explaining it very quickly but

446.58 --> 451.5
hey if anybody else

449.099 --> 453.479
wants to get into it it's in the title

451.5 --> 456.36
you can address me about it I'll talk

453.479 --> 459.56
back I'll try to explain it too because

456.36 --> 459.56
I finally get it now

462.479 --> 468.0
like I even proposed like a

465.74 --> 471.8
Schrodinger's cat

468.0 --> 471.8
setup for the information

472.62 --> 478.08
like the information receiver so that

475.259 --> 480.3
the experiment set up basically beams uh

478.08 --> 483.919
the information through Wireless

480.3 --> 487.979
transfer to a device that's in a box

483.919 --> 489.96
that's potentially above a

487.979 --> 492.65999999999997
what is it a

489.96 --> 495.29999999999995
a beaker of acid

492.66 --> 498.66
and it's like a random system that it

495.3 --> 501.419
can fall in there right but it just

498.66 --> 503.22
doesn't matter even if anybody knows

501.419 --> 505.44
whether it exists or not

503.22 --> 507.53900000000004
it only matters that it exists so

505.44 --> 509.52
literally like the wave function will

507.539 --> 513.24
collapse

509.52 --> 515.6999999999999
if it fell in the acid

513.24 --> 518.399
uh wait it will not collapse if it fell

515.7 --> 520.8000000000001
in the asset so you can literally know

518.399 --> 522.779
whether the information is retrievable

520.8 --> 525.62
or Not by whether the wave function

522.779 --> 529.76
collapses it's that fascinating

525.62 --> 529.76
AEV 97 good to see you

531.25 --> 535.2
[Music]

532.8 --> 538.26
hilarious

535.2 --> 540.0600000000001
the black thumb yeah I was stuck on a

538.26 --> 541.019
black thumb for a year so I got my thumb

540.06 --> 543.2399999999999
back

541.019 --> 544.8
thanks to Evie

543.24 --> 548.48
don't know I think I told you guys

544.8 --> 548.4799999999999
yesterday I'm not sure

548.7 --> 553.74
yesterday was a very Rowdy day I got

551.58 --> 556.32
into an argument too on

553.74 --> 559.6800000000001
on Nathan's again

556.32 --> 561.779
but like with uh with bride but it was

559.68 --> 563.959
like a yeah

561.779 --> 568.38
we were both

563.959 --> 570.5999999999999
emphasizing different things all that

568.38 --> 572.1
but in the end we did agree

570.6 --> 573.5400000000001
and I thought it was an interesting

572.1 --> 577.019
discussion

573.54 --> 579.12
it was during the after show so

577.019 --> 581.899
kind of looking forward to listening

579.12 --> 581.899
back to that part

587.94 --> 592.0400000000001
just

589.019 --> 592.04
oh my God

592.5 --> 596.899
it's really pathetic gamer guy

601.8 --> 607.3389999999999
yeah

603.36 --> 607.339
hey Richard G it's you

608.8 --> 612.01
[Music]

615.54 --> 621.38
yeah it's it's not just not a globe

618.54 --> 621.38
gamer guy

623.7 --> 629.519
it's not just a glow

626.7 --> 632.58
it's a flat plane

629.519 --> 635.94
in a container the dimensions of the

632.58 --> 639.4200000000001
container are not completely known

635.94 --> 644.899
but can be estimated

639.42 --> 644.899
yeah and there's lights in the sky

645.0 --> 649.399
that we cannot basically

649.56 --> 657.7199999999999
prove to be in any actual location so

652.68 --> 660.5999999999999
they're like a a holographic spectacle

657.72 --> 663.0600000000001
which is a colloquial description

660.6 --> 665.72
right that that is reality that is what

663.06 --> 665.7199999999999
we're living in

667.32 --> 674.6
yeah is is that sufficient for it's not

671.16 --> 674.6
a globe instead of that

678.66 --> 684.86
I know who you are gamer guy

681.72 --> 684.86
I Know Who You Are

693.0 --> 699.5
we had a whole conversation about that

695.1 --> 699.5
like weeks ago I I haven't forgotten

704.279 --> 707.72
because all you said was

707.94 --> 713.1600000000001
well I didn't say that today so

710.88 --> 716.48
if you're just here to be whiny and

713.16 --> 716.48
complaining I'll kick you out

717.6 --> 722.72
I'm not in the mood for a dumb trolling

719.76 --> 722.72
[ __ ] okay

724.44 --> 730.1600000000001
I got too much good energy to waste it

726.959 --> 730.16
on that sort of nonsense

730.5 --> 735.2
I gotta talk about space desert you see

736.44 --> 740.5790000000001
oh

737.88 --> 744.36
I'm not a troll if I think you're oh

740.579 --> 748.3199999999999
okay well in that case get the [ __ ] out

744.36 --> 753.24
I'm lying yes I'm lying guys

748.32 --> 754.5
I'm so lying of course I am [ __ ] [ __ ]

753.24 --> 756.9590000000001
off

754.5 --> 759.48
right this time you're I'm gonna keep

756.959 --> 761.459
you on the banned list you probably went

759.48 --> 763.62
shitty like this the last time and I

761.459 --> 766.68
kind of forgot about it and I just

763.62 --> 768.72
retained the memory of like oh that's an

766.68 --> 771.18
actually nice person

768.72 --> 773.5790000000001
I have that sometimes you see Mandela

771.18 --> 775.38
effect applies to me too where if

773.579 --> 777.5999999999999
somebody starts out kind of nice and

775.38 --> 779.88
then turns shitty and I kick him out I

777.6 --> 782.22
forget about the Turning shitty and

779.88 --> 785.959
getting and kicking them out part I just

782.22 --> 785.9590000000001
forget about that part a lot of time

786.3 --> 791.279
and that's probably what happened here

789.24 --> 793.76
I just saw oh gamer guy why is he bad

791.279 --> 793.76
huh

794.12 --> 799.32
oh this is why he's mad

797.04 --> 803.36
just called me a liar for absolutely

799.32 --> 803.36
nothing but it's a gamma [ __ ]

808.639 --> 816.5
you wanted to know what's the LIE

813.0 --> 816.5
do you really want to know

817.019 --> 821.0600000000001
I don't know man why don't you just

821.399 --> 826.1
talk to the trolls or something

826.2 --> 831.839
oh by the way if any other troll dickwad

829.56 --> 834.66
thinks it's a good idea to just

831.839 --> 837.0
completely copy my show and in its

834.66 --> 839.2199999999999
entirety and then post itself with an

837.0 --> 841.26
alter title if you think you can get

839.22 --> 843.98
away with that think again George

841.26 --> 843.98
Sanford

850.139 --> 854.339
I mean Clips is one thing especially if

852.779 --> 856.079
you're gonna give commentary I'm fine

854.339 --> 859.8000000000001
with that you know

856.079 --> 863.2199999999999
it's pointless most of the time

859.8 --> 865.079
but and you know I don't respond to

863.22 --> 867.48
those things like I don't make separate

865.079 --> 870.9799999999999
videos response videos I'll talk about

867.48 --> 870.98
it on my show perhaps but

871.62 --> 876.18
yeah if you're just gonna copy my entire

873.839 --> 879.1800000000001
show I will give you a copyright strike

876.18 --> 881.3389999999999
just so you know yeah

879.18 --> 883.9799999999999
this is my work

881.339 --> 887.8800000000001
literally

883.98 --> 891.0
and you're not just gonna copy my shows

887.88 --> 893.519
like even if you're a cool guy

891.0 --> 895.26
I wouldn't even well I wouldn't strike

893.519 --> 899.16
you for it I just ask you to take it

895.26 --> 903.019
down but like don't just copy my shows

899.16 --> 903.019
want to make Clips that's cool

906.0 --> 908.839
don't be a dick

917.16 --> 923.779
space deserts while what's this now yeah

919.68 --> 923.779
Oz yeah I've been thinking

923.88 --> 927.56
my ball win got restless

929.279 --> 935.04
this is science fiction of course it is

932.279 --> 937.92
right space desert so

935.04 --> 939.42
we all know supposedly according to

937.92 --> 943.26
heliocentrism

939.42 --> 947.04
meteor belts exists and meteors exist

943.26 --> 949.139
right could be whatever an exploded

947.04 --> 951.8389999999999
planet or something

949.139 --> 953.5790000000001
whatever they say it could cause usually

951.839 --> 955.74
I think it's like an exploded Planet

953.579 --> 958.92
that's what they say it is supposedly

955.74 --> 962.12
the meteor belt in our solar system

958.92 --> 962.12
but here's the thing

963.06 --> 967.68
it's super unstable

965.339 --> 970.74
meat tears basically go smacking into

967.68 --> 973.62
one another all the time

970.74 --> 976.74
this is like no it's like even like

973.62 --> 979.139
demonstrated you could say in well who

976.74 --> 981.6
was first with that [ __ ] Star Wars they

979.139 --> 983.399
showed that like oh meteors oh [ __ ]

981.6 --> 986.339
we're going into the media belt like

983.399 --> 989.04
they were the first to really show how

986.339 --> 991.8000000000001
calamitous that is great special effects

989.04 --> 995.699
for a Time by the way amazing

991.8 --> 998.639
like George Lucas really really knew how

995.699 --> 1000.68
to how to make it feel real

998.639 --> 1003.44
with that part

1000.68 --> 1005.42
great job but yeah there's this

1003.44 --> 1008.62
consequence you see

1005.42 --> 1012.62
there's still well even if you're gonna

1008.62 --> 1013.759
ignore entropy concerning gas laws and

1012.62 --> 1016.639
all that

1013.759 --> 1019.16
even if you do that well then like meet

1016.639 --> 1020.54
your belts how long is it gonna stay

1019.16 --> 1022.899
rocks

1020.54 --> 1025.819
because the thing is about

1022.899 --> 1030.559
deterioration here on Earth too

1025.819 --> 1033.28
uh well rocks eventually turn to sand

1030.559 --> 1033.28
and dust

1033.799 --> 1037.04
all right it gets smaller and smaller

1036.079 --> 1038.24
until

1037.04 --> 1042.02
yeah

1038.24 --> 1044.66
like eventually it'll become grapple

1042.02 --> 1047.36
like well what would be considered micro

1044.66 --> 1049.8200000000002
meteorites right which can still go very

1047.36 --> 1052.4599999999998
fast yeah but

1049.82 --> 1054.74
if it's all just gonna smack into one

1052.46 --> 1058.88
another how long is it gonna take

1054.74 --> 1062.66
before it's all turned to sand

1058.88 --> 1065.679
meteor belts should only exist for a

1062.66 --> 1065.679
very short period

1066.02 --> 1073.1
like in astronomical time lines right

1069.919 --> 1075.38
into extreme development yeah it should

1073.1 --> 1079.6
only take a very short time before it

1075.38 --> 1079.6000000000001
actually turns into a space desert

1081.02 --> 1085.34
yeah the meteor belt by now if it's

1083.539 --> 1087.44
really billions of years well then

1085.34 --> 1091.0
shouldn't it be like a

1087.44 --> 1091.0
a sand belt

1092.78 --> 1095.539
right

1094.039 --> 1097.96
all those meteors are going to keep

1095.539 --> 1100.7
smashing into each other

1097.96 --> 1103.3400000000001
unpredictably well then it should just

1100.7 --> 1105.679
become grinded down smaller and smaller

1103.34 --> 1109.0
and smaller and it shouldn't be a lot of

1105.679 --> 1109.0
rocks floating around anymore

1109.52 --> 1114.8799999999999
should be a lot of sand floating around

1114.919 --> 1120.6200000000001
and maybe even like coagulating

1118.299 --> 1123.98
microgravity or blah blah blah something

1120.62 --> 1125.6
right but giant rocks will deteriorate

1123.98 --> 1126.7
if they keep smashing into each other

1125.6 --> 1129.1399999999999
for

1126.7 --> 1132.64
billions of years

1129.14 --> 1132.64
seriously think about it

1135.62 --> 1141.559
look at how much sand formed here on

1138.32 --> 1143.12
Earth in supposedly all the time that it

1141.559 --> 1146.12
existed

1143.12 --> 1147.6789999999999
according to heliocentrism well if it

1146.12 --> 1150.7399999999998
formed over here

1147.679 --> 1152.96
what about a much more violent scenario

1150.74 --> 1157.22
of rocks continually

1152.96 --> 1160.16
flying around bashing into one another

1157.22 --> 1163.58
potentially really hard really fast too

1160.16 --> 1165.8600000000001
and like that forever without any moment

1163.58 --> 1170.24
where it gets to settle

1165.86 --> 1173.4799999999998
like yeah shouldn't there then also be

1170.24 --> 1177.28
just a lot of space deserts

1173.48 --> 1177.28
instead of meat ear belts

1180.14 --> 1185.74
so yeah that was my uh idea about space

1183.08 --> 1185.74
deserts

1187.7 --> 1189.88
foreign

1190.059 --> 1194.559
just logic sort of

1196.16 --> 1202.3400000000001
scratch out a few things to make it work

1198.32 --> 1204.5
but still I mean that's supposedly like

1202.34 --> 1206.6
how it works right so why are there

1204.5 --> 1209.299
still meteor belts why isn't it all just

1206.6 --> 1214.12
grappled and

1209.299 --> 1214.12
piles of space sand and dust

1219.919 --> 1223.94
and technically

1221.96 --> 1227.419
if you're going to continuate that

1223.94 --> 1231.02
wouldn't eventually gravity or whatever

1227.419 --> 1233.3600000000001
like make it have tendency to coagulate

1231.02 --> 1236.84
in its powder form right it's not really

1233.36 --> 1238.8799999999999
gonna just bash or displace much and in

1236.84 --> 1241.4599999999998
static electricity perhaps does that

1238.88 --> 1243.5200000000002
even work in space whatever it's

1241.46 --> 1246.14
something some

1243.52 --> 1249.2
coagulating force it might even like

1246.14 --> 1252.0200000000002
turn into a desert planet or something

1249.2 --> 1255.4
eventually

1252.02 --> 1255.4
wouldn't that be logical

1255.5 --> 1261.14
so that even planets that are not like

1258.02 --> 1263.66
wildly kicked out of their orbit somehow

1261.14 --> 1265.64
but get destroyed then there might be

1263.66 --> 1268.16
some meteorable it's like think about it

1265.64 --> 1269.9
like all Duran right Alderaan got blew

1268.16 --> 1272.8400000000001
up boom

1269.9 --> 1274.94
in Star Wars well there's this meteor

1272.84 --> 1275.9599999999998
[ __ ] that they ran into it's just debris

1274.94 --> 1280.1000000000001
everywhere

1275.96 --> 1283.24
eventually shouldn't that like just be

1280.1 --> 1283.24
powdery stuff

1285.2 --> 1290.539
then again thinking carefully like even

1287.66 --> 1293.059
how much meteors are supposedly in the

1290.539 --> 1294.919
media like do they even say it that it

1293.059 --> 1296.78
used to be a planet the meteor belt here

1294.919 --> 1299.659
in the solar system

1296.78 --> 1301.46
like thinking about how much stones and

1299.659 --> 1304.46
all that would be all spread around in

1301.46 --> 1307.3400000000001
that well joy and orbit

1304.46 --> 1309.5
is that even enough could that even have

1307.34 --> 1311.62
been a planet originally or is it too

1309.5 --> 1314.659
much debris

1311.62 --> 1317.1789999999999
volumetric wise I'm wondering

1314.659 --> 1320.24
or was it actually the largest planet

1317.179 --> 1325.179
ever was it like a super

1320.24 --> 1325.179
like a solid Jupiter or something

1327.559 --> 1332.96
that blew up

1330.38 --> 1336.7600000000002
I never understood the story really too

1332.96 --> 1336.76
much about the supposed meteor belt

1338.12 --> 1341.02
huh

1348.159 --> 1354.8600000000001
yeah AV yeah I know he's doing that and

1351.98 --> 1358.78
it's bad I mean dude if you want to like

1354.86 --> 1358.78
collect Clips then just make a playlist

1375.679 --> 1381.46
nothing can stop us now because Roe made

1378.26 --> 1381.46
a Stars uh

1381.679 --> 1386.3600000000001
sorry am I triggering you guys too much

1384.559 --> 1388.6399999999999
or something is this too much space

1386.36 --> 1391.78
fantasy is this too much borrowing for

1388.64 --> 1391.7800000000002
you in the early morning

1394.7 --> 1397.419
thank you

1409.22 --> 1412.72
Oh I thought he was a good guy

1416.179 --> 1420.1000000000001
I thought it was kind of neutral

1423.02 --> 1427.22
but he was trying to stay out of trouble

1425.419 --> 1429.7990000000002
most of the time

1427.22 --> 1433.039
and that's already like oh wow you're

1429.799 --> 1436.299
actually making effort well yeah

1433.039 --> 1436.299
that's good enough for me

1450.799 --> 1454.52
hmm

1452.419 --> 1455.96
low M appeal

1454.52 --> 1458.4189999999999
yeah

1455.96 --> 1461.8600000000001
I guess I guess you're right it's really

1458.419 --> 1461.8600000000001
just pointless

1466.45 --> 1470.9
[Music]

1467.9 --> 1470.9
okay

1477.4 --> 1483.98
right I got an illuminatios on here

1482.059 --> 1486.2
and I'm going to take a bite out of it

1483.98 --> 1488.78
because I'm hungry

1486.2 --> 1492.52
cheers

1488.78 --> 1492.52
really this one's really beautiful

1492.919 --> 1495.5200000000002
perfect

1496.76 --> 1499.78
anyway cheers

1544.1 --> 1547.1
ah

1549.38 --> 1552.0390000000002
me

1557.72 --> 1562.1000000000001
used to make this early videos early

1559.88 --> 1564.679
well no Terry he doesn't really make

1562.1 --> 1567.08
this videos it just copies them and

1564.679 --> 1570.679
gives them shitty titles

1567.08 --> 1573.6999999999998
and yes he used to do that before

1570.679 --> 1573.7
even with me

1578.9 --> 1584.48
I just didn't really see it as hostile

1582.62 --> 1587.7199999999998
first

1584.48 --> 1590.179
it's just like okay

1587.72 --> 1592.039
I guess I just thought like oh well

1590.179 --> 1594.02
apparently he thinks it's a really good

1592.039 --> 1595.94
show or something so he wanted to upload

1594.02 --> 1597.559
it on his channel

1595.94 --> 1600.22
because he didn't give really shitty

1597.559 --> 1600.22
titles first

1616.21 --> 1619.4
[Music]

1626.659 --> 1631.8200000000002
right anyway I don't want to talk about

1629.72 --> 1635.0
George Sanford just for the record I

1631.82 --> 1637.58
know you guys are like

1635.0 --> 1639.799
a little bit heard about it

1637.58 --> 1641.059
because he has been like very familiar

1639.799 --> 1643.779
in the chat he has been hanging around

1641.059 --> 1643.779
here for years

1644.299 --> 1650.48
to be fair

1647.059 --> 1652.34
I never really liked him that much

1650.48 --> 1654.32
I thought he was he had interesting

1652.34 --> 1656.8999999999999
things to say at times though

1654.32 --> 1660.3799999999999
and he'd had also

1656.9 --> 1662.419
given me some pretty good tips from a

1660.38 --> 1664.3400000000001
very neutral perspective because he

1662.419 --> 1665.779
didn't seem to like get emotionally

1664.34 --> 1668.1789999999999
carried away

1665.779 --> 1669.98
but he was still intellectually helpful

1668.179 --> 1673.039
he was genuinely

1669.98 --> 1675.22
so he's not like a completely piece of

1673.039 --> 1675.22
trash

1677.419 --> 1685.179
he's just super gamma spiraling right

1680.539 --> 1685.179
now because I heard him or something

1690.02 --> 1695.4189999999999
but yeah I'm not gonna tolerate just

1692.419 --> 1698.24
people copying videos from my channel

1695.419 --> 1701.2990000000002
which is literally my product

1698.24 --> 1702.74
that is monetized and and then expect me

1701.299 --> 1705.6399999999999
to not

1702.74 --> 1705.64
strike them

1706.7 --> 1713.679
if they give shitty titles to it like

1709.84 --> 1713.6789999999999
dude forget it

1714.14 --> 1720.919
if you want to make some commentary

1716.48 --> 1723.14
video or point out how crazy I am

1720.919 --> 1724.279
well means dude go review me good luck

1723.14 --> 1727.039
with that

1724.279 --> 1729.38
good luck with not looking like a

1727.039 --> 1731.12
complete ass for completely not

1729.38 --> 1735.14
understanding what I'm even getting

1731.12 --> 1738.039
excited about for example right

1735.14 --> 1738.039
good luck with that

1745.779 --> 1750.62
because that's what mostly happens when

1748.64 --> 1751.76
when Sean Hawkins does that kind of

1750.62 --> 1755.02
thing

1751.76 --> 1755.02
or reichi

1755.84 --> 1758.4399999999998
anyway

1762.82 --> 1768.76
Irene Pro editors just the troll Nathan

1766.22 --> 1768.76
what

1776.48 --> 1779.679
what are you talking about

1796.46 --> 1801.679
right yeah turret but it's not just

1798.74 --> 1804.6200000000001
changing the title because of that it's

1801.679 --> 1807.279
all because the video was the video from

1804.62 --> 1807.279
the day before

1809.84 --> 1815.6
look if you wanted to highlight the part

1812.539 --> 1816.86
where I I told you off I was mean to you

1815.6 --> 1820.1
or whatever

1816.86 --> 1822.62
then edit that part out

1820.1 --> 1826.399
and then add your commentary do it in

1822.62 --> 1828.26
text like reichi or actually hey make a

1826.399 --> 1831.62
bit of an appearance and use your voice

1828.26 --> 1833.36
to criticize it yeah do that if you had

1831.62 --> 1836.12
done that

1833.36 --> 1838.279
I would have not given you a copyright

1836.12 --> 1842.62
strike if you're just gonna copy my

1838.279 --> 1842.62
entire show from the previous day dude

1844.279 --> 1847.779
that's yeah

1848.12 --> 1851.3799999999999
I ain't having that

1857.179 --> 1860.179
foreign

1873.62 --> 1876.6599999999999
[Music]

1890.679 --> 1899.26
yeah well AV

1894.08 --> 1899.26
you are just here relatively recent

1899.419 --> 1905.8990000000001
you haven't been there in the early days

1903.32 --> 1906.98
Nathan was getting professional trolls

1905.899 --> 1909.1399999999999
after him

1906.98 --> 1911.6
they really like to try to shut his

1909.14 --> 1914.38
channel down all kinds of things pour

1911.6 --> 1914.3799999999999
and bomb him

1919.46 --> 1925.3990000000001
and also the Ballers were literally or

1923.0 --> 1928.399
the anti-flat earthers now back then

1925.399 --> 1931.9399999999998
some of them had quite a lot of money

1928.399 --> 1934.9599999999998
it's been very very strong indications

1931.94 --> 1934.96
that some of them

1937.1 --> 1945.399
was like throwing around serious money

1940.64 --> 1945.3990000000001
in like anti-flat Earth operations

1947.899 --> 1953.299
some people even suspect

1950.48 --> 1955.7
I have I'm not gonna source that I'm not

1953.299 --> 1960.08
gonna confirm it either it's a rumor and

1955.7 --> 1961.94
even Randy had actually partaken in that

1960.08 --> 1964.539
so pretty weird

1961.94 --> 1964.539
right

1964.82 --> 1970.34
but yeah there is actually like money

1968.24 --> 1973.6
going around for

1970.34 --> 1973.6
for troll activities

1976.64 --> 1982.22
but it's not like oh here comes another

1979.399 --> 1984.799
pay troll no that's nonsense that

1982.22 --> 1987.559
doesn't happen if if they're gonna spend

1984.799 --> 1989.6589999999999
money on trolling they're gonna make it

1987.559 --> 1991.22
much better than just a little bit of

1989.659 --> 1995.019
nuisance yeah because a little bit of

1991.22 --> 1995.019
nuisance doesn't break a Channel at all

1995.539 --> 2001.059
no there will be attempting to hack

1999.62 --> 2004.1789999999999
to like

2001.059 --> 2007.539
collect evidence and like

2004.179 --> 2010.3600000000001
do all kinds of things to like make

2007.539 --> 2013.0
police reporting all kinds of [ __ ] like

2010.36 --> 2015.299
that's actual trolling and that can be

2013.0 --> 2015.299
paid

2024.46 --> 2028.38
people yeah they do

2028.96 --> 2032.039
oh and by the way

2033.82 --> 2038.2
what

2036.399 --> 2040.12
no but it doesn't matter the amount of

2038.2 --> 2042.3990000000001
people sometimes when people are at a

2040.12 --> 2044.9189999999999
threat they get trolled yeah this

2042.399 --> 2048.94
literally I think probably

2044.919 --> 2050.919
or even the classified I'm not sure

2048.94 --> 2053.139
but they did that to a whole bunch of

2050.919 --> 2057.04
alternative medical people like wherever

2053.139 --> 2061.119
they'd show up they'd get zerked yeah

2057.04 --> 2065.32
my paid trolls paid like thousands of

2061.119 --> 2068.02
them that good that got super nasty

2065.32 --> 2070.9190000000003
and like threatening with life death

2068.02 --> 2070.919
threats everything

2070.96 --> 2077.02
as soon as you touch certain subjects

2073.899 --> 2078.58
those were paid by big Pharma like

2077.02 --> 2081.04
blatantly

2078.58 --> 2082.899
anything that would like oh you're

2081.04 --> 2086.44
saying anything bad about a vaccine oh

2082.899 --> 2087.879
an entire troll doctor shows up

2086.44 --> 2089.5
right

2087.879 --> 2091.839
and threatening you oh medical

2089.5 --> 2093.399
misinformation now that it doesn't

2091.839 --> 2095.919
really happen like that anymore now it's

2093.399 --> 2096.94
the corporate system doing this mostly

2095.919 --> 2099.52
just

2096.94 --> 2102.64
saying like oh this is misinformation uh

2099.52 --> 2107.02
Flack if it's a hot item

2102.64 --> 2109.839
but back then like 10 years ago and more

2107.02 --> 2112.48
they really went after alternative

2109.839 --> 2114.16
doctors on social media really hard to

2112.48 --> 2117.599
say some of them even got freaking

2114.16 --> 2117.5989999999997
assassinated allegedly

2117.76 --> 2123.099
okay

2119.14 --> 2125.5789999999997
paid paid trolls definitely

2123.099 --> 2128.98
hardcore

2125.579 --> 2132.099
so they exist and they do go after

2128.98 --> 2136.54
relatively small groups of people

2132.099 --> 2139.06
like doctors that they don't have like a

2136.54 --> 2141.64
billion audience live [ __ ]

2139.06 --> 2144.339
often they just do

2141.64 --> 2148.3799999999997
streams on their own and then they they

2144.339 --> 2148.38
upload their fit stuff now right

2152.02 --> 2157.02
because they get shut down when they do

2153.46 --> 2157.02
it live and they get too much audience

2157.78 --> 2161.0400000000004
so yeah

2161.32 --> 2167.079
I'm pretty convinced that a few years

2163.839 --> 2169.619
back fpd did have actual pay trolls go

2167.079 --> 2169.619
after them

that all the driver instructors all use

2826.839 --> 2831.04

something

2926.44 --> 2933.04
well personally I like driving fast

2930.28 --> 2935.38
but it's also because I just like I'm

2933.04 --> 2938.16
weirdly obsessed with like logistical

2935.38 --> 2938.1600000000003
perfection

2940.66 --> 2944.94
I even do it on my bicycle too

2948.04 --> 2951.579
like

2949.3 --> 2955.119
I do that all the time it's like I

2951.579 --> 2957.099
puzzle so I'm driving on my bicycle

2955.119 --> 2960.4
there's going to be a Crossroads ahead

2957.099 --> 2961.54
then I look at where everything is at at

2960.4 --> 2963.94
what speed

2961.54 --> 2965.859
and if people are like

2963.94 --> 2968.619
standing still or doubting or like

2965.859 --> 2972.5789999999997
whatever is happening like all at once

2968.619 --> 2975.1600000000003
and then I calculate in my head exactly

2972.579 --> 2977.079
when the moment is where I could

2975.16 --> 2979.8999999999996
basically go through all of it without

2977.079 --> 2983.02
slowing down

2979.9 --> 2985.1800000000003
to like as ever the apparent chaos is

2983.02 --> 2987.52
going to just like have that perfect

2985.18 --> 2990.52
moment where I just go

2987.52 --> 2993.46
through it all like cars going across

2990.52 --> 2995.92
bicycles stuff happening like that's

2993.46 --> 2998.5
what I do and that's the thing I really

2995.92 --> 3001.339
get a kick out of because I've gotten

2998.5 --> 3001.339
very good at it

3003.96 --> 3008.18
and all you need to do is just timing

3009.359 --> 3014.7599999999998
it's all about like looking ahead and

3011.94 --> 3017.819
then really really understand what's

3014.76 --> 3021.1400000000003
happening like movement wise and like

3017.819 --> 3021.14
what is going to do what

3028.74 --> 3032.4599999999996
and then just find the perfect timing

3030.54 --> 3035.52
then you just know like oh no there's no

3032.46 --> 3037.819
point in rushing now I just wait a bit

3035.52 --> 3040.5
and then start back up again and I go

3037.819 --> 3042.85
right through it because it'll work

3040.5 --> 3046.02
perfectly because I timed it

3046.74 --> 3052.02
like I barely even have to use the

3048.839 --> 3055.5

3052.02 --> 3057.359
great by the way but in well if I really

3055.5 --> 3059.16
needed the early break I'm gonna stand

3057.359 --> 3061.92
on the ground with my heels because

3059.16 --> 3066.3799999999997
those freaking brakes will not they will

3061.92 --> 3066.38
not like bring me to a halt very quickly

3069.0 --> 3077.66
so yeah it really pays off to be

3073.64 --> 3077.66
extraordinarily well timed

3078.96 --> 3084.5

3081.839 --> 3084.5
have to break

3091.859 --> 3097.0789999999997

3424.8 --> 3427.7000000000003
working that's all

3430.98 --> 3435.44
as everybody in chat is now talking

3432.96 --> 3435.44
about him

3441.48 --> 3446.64
like he did with Evie

3443.7 --> 3448.02
well Evie's account wasn't made on that

3446.64 --> 3450.9
day

3448.02 --> 3453.9
and I'd seen Evie around and actually

3450.9 --> 3457.28
addressing subjects of the show and all

3453.9 --> 3457.28
that that's the difference

3463.319 --> 3467.599
born list just wants the attention there

3470.28 --> 3475.3190000000004
just trying to move in there it's like

3472.14 --> 3477.18
oh no it's my chat no I'm I'm one of you

3475.319 --> 3480.9
guys

3477.18 --> 3483.98
yes yeah and you're all biting in

3480.9 --> 3483.98
you're all biting

3486.059 --> 3491.8390000000004
it's not funny you're out of here I

3488.28 --> 3491.8390000000004
don't trust you get the [ __ ] out

3493.5 --> 3496.64
you're not funny

3496.74 --> 3501.2999999999997
you haven't identified yourself you

3499.14 --> 3504.2599999999998
clearly know people here

3501.3 --> 3504.26
get the [ __ ] up

3505.579 --> 3512.94
oh you you think are we might have

3509.22 --> 3514.9199999999996
spoken in Nathan's before here

3512.94 --> 3517.68
could be Evie

3514.92 --> 3519.54
I think I banned you first because you

3517.68 --> 3522.24
were immediately getting annoying just

3519.54 --> 3526.079
because I said you were probably a troll

3522.24 --> 3528.54
then I saw you well just around other

3526.079 --> 3530.6400000000003
places having conversations

3528.54 --> 3533.48
and getting on people's nerves and then

3530.64 --> 3533.48
I realized wait

3534.599 --> 3537.8590000000004
maybe I was wrong

3544.02 --> 3548.339
as you were not just having

3545.94 --> 3550.44
conversations only about things that

3548.339 --> 3552.48
weren't the subject of the video

3550.44 --> 3555.359
so I was like oh no wait you might

3552.48 --> 3557.52
actually not be there to disrupt you're

3555.359 --> 3559.2
just you just have a tendency to get on

3557.52 --> 3563.059
people's nerves a bit

3559.2 --> 3563.0589999999997
it's your your personality

3563.7 --> 3567.299
crypto stuff

3565.98 --> 3569.76
yeah

3567.299 --> 3573.2
oh yeah I remember that yeah yeah don't

3569.76 --> 3573.2000000000003
promote crypto [ __ ] here

3574.799 --> 3580.02
like that crypto is not the answer at

3577.079 --> 3581.28
all I explained that yeah I I still

3580.02 --> 3584.16
stand by that

3581.28 --> 3587.6600000000003
hey you can be in it all you like don't

3584.16 --> 3587.66
don't try to sell

3588.24 --> 3594.0
unless you're selling your stuff to

3590.52 --> 3596.94
support me then yeah then that's fine

3594.0 --> 3599.72
you can sell it all you like

3596.94 --> 3599.7200000000003
hmm

3602.579 --> 3608.119
but I I'm not recommending crypto to

3605.28 --> 3608.119
like my followers

3608.579 --> 3613.619
for the record

3611.099 --> 3615.7200000000003
like not as an investment worthy thing

3613.619 --> 3617.88
like if you're like if you happen to

3615.72 --> 3620.8999999999996
have it you yeah you might be able to do

3617.88 --> 3620.9
stuff with it that's cool

3622.38 --> 3628.559
just don't go getting loans at the bank

3625.5 --> 3630.059
to invest that into crypto

3628.559 --> 3632.96
if you're like that I don't want

3630.059 --> 3632.96
anything to do with you

3642.119 --> 3647.04
right but uh yeah whoever this bornless

3644.94 --> 3650.52
one is I don't trust him I think he

3647.04 --> 3653.46
might be like Bobby steals or something

3650.52 --> 3657.68
it's just this

3653.46 --> 3657.68
definitely not a new person

3659.64 --> 3664.4
definitely a soccer count guaranteed

3666.96 --> 3672.02
if that was a new person they would have

3668.76 --> 3672.0200000000004
responded completely different

3673.98 --> 3677.52
they would probably be like what what

3675.72 --> 3680.819
the [ __ ]

3677.52 --> 3683.46
I just got here

3680.819 --> 3686.72
I don't know anything

3683.46 --> 3690.0
why are you being so suspicious no no no

3686.72 --> 3692.54
this person definitely knows how things

3690.0 --> 3692.54
work here

3708.059 --> 3713.579
spot on

3710.339 --> 3715.5589999999997
you talking to me Richard

3713.579 --> 3717.7400000000002
are you talking to somebody else in the

3715.559 --> 3717.7400000000002
chat

3720.359 --> 3724.94
George Sanford

3722.16 --> 3724.94
Maybe

3727.38 --> 3731.359
it didn't seem like him though

3732.119 --> 3738.059
like too gay to be George George Sanford

3735.359 --> 3741.2
is like too stoic to act like that

3738.059 --> 3741.2000000000003
like he's too I

3741.72 --> 3745.68
I don't know for sure anymore but I

3743.52 --> 3747.78
would almost say like he's too proud to

3745.68 --> 3750.18
like start showing up as a soccer guy

3747.78 --> 3753.6600000000003
he's not that game

3750.18 --> 3756.0589999999997
okay unless he is and that's really

3753.66 --> 3759.48
horrific idea if he actually became that

3756.059 --> 3762.63
bad let's hope he didn't

3759.48 --> 3762.63
[Music]

3763.88 --> 3766.88
yeah

3770.54 --> 3776.099
whoever it was it was very well familiar

3773.28 --> 3779.6400000000003
with everybody here

3776.099 --> 3782.2200000000003
and yeah definitely not a newcomer

3779.64 --> 3784.2
and he did not or he or she did not

3782.22 --> 3785.66
identify themselves

3784.2 --> 3788.339
ah

3785.66 --> 3790.74
yeah probably not quality steals Barbie

3788.339 --> 3793.2599999999998
steals just make soccer counts

3790.74 --> 3796.04
he always shows up as himself

3793.26 --> 3796.0400000000004
like now

3798.96 --> 3801.7400000000002

[Music]

3890.48 --> 3893.9

but he also get he can get on people's

3905.339 --> 3909.18
nerves

3906.9 --> 3911.7000000000003
especially when it gets when he gets

3909.18 --> 3914.48
carried away with like ball fanaticism

3911.7 --> 3914.48
things

3918.48 --> 3920.4
okay

3919.23 --> 3923.299
[Music]

3920.4 --> 3927.0

3941.64 --> 3947.7799999999997

3944.58 --> 3947.7799999999997
[Music]

3947.88 --> 3951.079
hey Amy s

closet Effie

3977.64 --> 3981.66
I don't know

3980.339 --> 3983.7

maybe I could move virus is kind of like

3983.7 --> 3988.8799999999997
a ball win too except he's really stuck

3986.22 --> 3988.8799999999997
in that part

3991.02 --> 3997.38
[Music]

3994.5 --> 4000.38
and I get it I mean it's a real rush to

3997.38 --> 4003.619
be a Ballwin it is

4000.38 --> 4007.4
it really is I mean me figuring out

4003.619 --> 4010.2200000000003
space deserts huge kick

4007.4 --> 4012.26
just such a kick about the just the

4010.22 --> 4015.3799999999997
mechanical thinking about is like yeah

4012.26 --> 4018.619
like yeah meteor belts

4015.38 --> 4020.78
they should all be space deserts

4018.619 --> 4023.059
what do you mean a bunch of rocks

4020.78 --> 4024.92
floating for billions of years

4023.059 --> 4027.799
no no

4024.92 --> 4031.7000000000003
yeah maybe one rock that's completely uh

4027.799 --> 4035.48
like wildly going somewhere out of orbit

4031.7 --> 4037.7
you know yeah sure it'll fly and fly for

4035.48 --> 4039.7400000000002
who knows how long and it'll almost

4037.7 --> 4042.5
nothing will hit it sure but if it's

4039.74 --> 4045.799
like stuck in a belt

4042.5 --> 4048.74
and moving and [ __ ] like hello that's

4045.799 --> 4052.9
gonna like turn to sand over it maybe

4048.74 --> 4052.8999999999996
just a million a couple of million years

4053.18 --> 4057.799
let alone billions

4055.16 --> 4059.5989999999997
I mean if sand forms from

4057.799 --> 4062.0
weather stuff

4059.599 --> 4064.6400000000003
right sand in deserts formed from

4062.0 --> 4066.44
weather erosion and all that on Earth

4064.64 --> 4068.42
in what is it

4066.44 --> 4071.18
a billionaire how old is Earth supposed

4068.42 --> 4074.059
to be a couple of billion years well why

4071.18 --> 4078.14
the hell wouldn't flee free-floating

4074.059 --> 4080.599
bashing rocks in a giant ring not turn

4078.14 --> 4083.24
to Desert why wouldn't it turn to just

4080.599 --> 4085.4
all sand and dust

4083.24 --> 4086.66
why are there still just big rocks

4085.4 --> 4089.98
around there

4086.66 --> 4089.98
it should all be dust

4091.52 --> 4098.38
space deserts that's right space

4095.0 --> 4098.38
the final frontier

4098.54 --> 4104.299
final frontier of the imagination

4101.779 --> 4108.339000000001
the virtual existence

4104.299 --> 4108.339
Beyond available volume

4118.04 --> 4123.0199999999995
he deleted the channel slo-mo wow

4121.51 --> 4127.0
[Music]

4123.02 --> 4127.0
yeah not suspicious at all

4128.54 --> 4135.64
thanks by the way for the uh Intel I

4131.779 --> 4135.64
really appreciate that SoMo

4139.94 --> 4145.639999999999
I thought I didn't believe in space no

4142.52 --> 4148.52
no no I believe in space

4145.64 --> 4151.52
but it's not real though yeah

4148.52 --> 4153.620000000001
I don't have to work at the really is

4151.52 --> 4155.900000000001
level okay Evie

4153.62 --> 4158.9
I can believe

4155.9 --> 4161.0599999999995
I can believe in space

4158.9 --> 4165.679
I can't believe in the ball Earth I

4161.06 --> 4167.54
can't believe yeah I know it's flat

4165.679 --> 4170.179
I know we're contained and there's

4167.54 --> 4173.54
definitely not something outside of that

4170.179 --> 4175.88
that's accessible to us and the lights

4173.54 --> 4178.1
that we see in the sky are definitely

4175.88 --> 4182.42
not outside

4178.1 --> 4186.14
of the available volume literally but I

4182.42 --> 4189.339
can definitely believe in outer space

4186.14 --> 4189.339
when I choose to

4194.36 --> 4196.36
do

4206.179 --> 4212.4400000000005
you would spend more time on a globe

4208.34 --> 4212.4400000000005
Channel if you were a flat earther

4212.56 --> 4217.280000000001
that statement really proves that you're

4216.38 --> 4219.02
not

4217.28 --> 4220.34
a flat earther

4219.02 --> 4223.34
yeah

4220.34 --> 4224.900000000001
yeah we we don't like to hang around

4223.34 --> 4230.02
Glovers

4224.9 --> 4230.0199999999995
it's really [ __ ] annoying you see

4231.56 --> 4237.679
we find it really annoying on average

4234.76 --> 4240.5
flat earthers don't really like to hang

4237.679 --> 4242.719
around clovers you know

4240.5 --> 4244.1
and on average globers don't really like

4242.719 --> 4247.219
to hang around flat earthers either

4244.1 --> 4249.38
you're kind of an exception like that

4247.219 --> 4253.2390000000005
you're just kind of a weirdo but hey

4249.38 --> 4253.2390000000005
it's a good type of weirdo

4257.42 --> 4261.82
and so zept happy

4259.46 --> 4261.82
hahaha

4267.14 --> 4271.64
right

4269.659 --> 4273.679
your person has to understand yeah but

4271.64 --> 4275.4800000000005
we don't need to understand the

4273.679 --> 4277.1
opposition what they're doing on Google

4275.48 --> 4278.659
virus

4277.1 --> 4282.860000000001
because

4278.659 --> 4284.599999999999
we know exactly how anti-flatter authors

4282.86 --> 4287.719
and Ballers think

4284.6 --> 4291.860000000001
we've back engineered the entire

4287.719 --> 4296.38
Fantastical cosmology I use it as a

4291.86 --> 4300.159
playground like Lagos in my head

4296.38 --> 4300.159000000001
Baldwin does that

4300.56 --> 4306.320000000001
we're not entertained by the clumsiness

4303.92 --> 4308.179
and ignorance of people that believe

4306.32 --> 4311.48
that's real

4308.179 --> 4314.08
it's quite agitating actually to sit

4311.48 --> 4314.08
around that

4324.92 --> 4330.02
you don't think you observe there's a

4327.739 --> 4331.4
difference right

4330.02 --> 4332.540000000001
I think

4331.4 --> 4334.46
what

4332.54 --> 4336.64
hey Gideon Sick by the way good to see

4334.46 --> 4336.64
you

4341.12 --> 4344.199
oh I do think

4344.96 --> 4351.1
I think I imagine I observe I do all of

4348.92 --> 4351.1
it

4352.1 --> 4360.08
I just keep them apart I'm not like well

4355.34 --> 4363.26
if I imagine this I observe this and I

4360.08 --> 4364.94
believe or like what is it

4363.26 --> 4367.04
what did you say again

4364.94 --> 4369.62
observe

4367.04 --> 4371.9
I observe this I imagine this and I

4369.62 --> 4374.659
believe that well that means it must all

4371.9 --> 4376.94
be won no

4374.659 --> 4379.96
no because I can believe in things that

4376.94 --> 4379.96
I know aren't true

4380.719 --> 4385.36
it's like a game you can just do that

4386.719 --> 4391.82
right when you're playing a video game

4388.52 --> 4393.080000000001
aren't you sort of like imagining that

4391.82 --> 4395.719
the game

4393.08 --> 4397.1
is the thing that is real where you're

4395.719 --> 4399.5
doing something

4397.1 --> 4402.26
isn't that happening in your mind aren't

4399.5 --> 4404.719
you suspending your disbelief well I can

4402.26 --> 4407.06
do that with the globe and just talking

4404.719 --> 4409.94
about that cosmology to me it's this

4407.06 --> 4412.96
giant science fiction story that we're

4409.94 --> 4412.96
all telling together

4414.739 --> 4418.879999999999
and unfortunately a whole bunch of

4416.6 --> 4420.1990000000005
people are not very good at it and a lot

4418.88 --> 4423.679
of people

4420.199 --> 4425.419999999999
just like they believe in it no matter

4423.679 --> 4428.3
what even if it doesn't make any sense

4425.42 --> 4430.88
and they don't know that it's not real

4428.3 --> 4433.06
and it's just it's kind of gone out of

4430.88 --> 4433.06
control

4433.46 --> 4437.12
in ways

4435.199 --> 4438.739
it's not clear as to what it is I

4437.12 --> 4441.76
thought originally it's just a

4438.739 --> 4441.759999999999
storytelling tradition

4443.0 --> 4450.02
that was spawned from storytelling

4446.659 --> 4454.5199999999995
Traditions based on astronomy

4450.02 --> 4456.320000000001
right like I think genuinely that the

4454.52 --> 4458.42
whole Global cosmology we talk about it

4456.32 --> 4460.46
right now and imagine things that that

4458.42 --> 4462.14
basically started out with astronomers

4460.46 --> 4465.08
pointing at like oh you see the

4462.14 --> 4467.84
constellation that's Orion see that's

4465.08 --> 4468.8
his belt and like imagine how that is

4467.84 --> 4471.02
that

4468.8 --> 4474.56
and then it just like

4471.02 --> 4476.3
just migrated the stories about the

4474.56 --> 4478.219
stars and how we recognize them

4476.3 --> 4481.219
basically started to like get

4478.219 --> 4483.32
re-engineered all their ideas about it

4481.219 --> 4485.54
other ways of what you're supposed to

4483.32 --> 4488.0599999999995
imagine they might have conjured up all

4485.54 --> 4491.06
kinds of the ideas like when this star

4488.06 --> 4494.0
becomes visible like all the spirits

4491.06 --> 4496.400000000001
will get like you're gonna be tested and

4494.0 --> 4498.5
if you don't like be pure then your

4496.4 --> 4500.0
spirit might be sucked away like who

4498.5 --> 4502.9
knows what the priests would have made

4500.0 --> 4502.9
up about it right

4503.12 --> 4508.699
the point is is that the stars were

4505.04 --> 4510.679
being used eventually to imagine things

4508.699 --> 4513.379999999999
about and basically become part of

4510.679 --> 4517.1
religion the imagination about them was

4513.38 --> 4519.32
being religiously used by priests

4517.1 --> 4522.4400000000005
that then later

4519.32 --> 4524.36
by the Jesuits much later

4522.44 --> 4528.5199999999995
was actually

4524.36 --> 4532.699
then math was being used to basically

4528.52 --> 4534.92
instead of telling a a story about like

4532.699 --> 4537.86
Fantastical things like gods or whatever

4534.92 --> 4540.679
doing things in the Stars

4537.86 --> 4543.679
it became like no literally we're gonna

4540.679 --> 4546.32
like create a like a

4543.679 --> 4548.4800000000005
an inside out reality we're gonna like

4546.32 --> 4551.659
make people imagine it completely

4548.48 --> 4553.4
different like everything is different

4551.659 --> 4556.339999999999
that it's like we're standing on a bow

4553.4 --> 4559.46
and there's infinite amount of room

4556.34 --> 4562.46
and other lights are also balls

4559.46 --> 4565.4
and they're just like used math to to

4562.46 --> 4567.56
design

4565.4 --> 4571.94
that system

4567.56 --> 4574.64
and then that became the religion

4571.94 --> 4577.879999999999
before it was just used for mythological

4574.64 --> 4580.76
references and maybe like priesthood

4577.88 --> 4583.58
tricks mysticism tricks referencing to

4580.76 --> 4586.34
the stars and oh fear the comet

4583.58 --> 4589.76
for example

4586.34 --> 4592.6
and then yeah the Jesuits I say it

4589.76 --> 4595.34
mostly that through Catholicism

4592.6 --> 4599.1990000000005
the Reversed world of the Outer Space

4595.34 --> 4599.1990000000005
Universe was conjured

4601.82 --> 4607.219
and it's it's been there ever since that

4605.12 --> 4609.44
story I mean it's not really gonna go

4607.219 --> 4611.84
away and I I like the story I think it's

4609.44 --> 4614.0
a very entertaining story

4611.84 --> 4615.860000000001
it's not good that it's believed to be

4614.0 --> 4618.199
real though

4615.86 --> 4619.219
but it is a good story like I've never

4618.199 --> 4622.04
been

4619.219 --> 4623.86
a fan of the idea like we need it to be

4622.04 --> 4627.92
abolished

4623.86 --> 4631.099999999999
forbid the globe cosmology

4627.92 --> 4634.04
like no no why the hell would you do

4631.1 --> 4636.58
that that's such a shame

4634.04 --> 4641.3
it's such an interesting

4636.58 --> 4643.4
storytelling medium science fiction idea

4641.3 --> 4644.6
and there's already so much based on

4643.4 --> 4647.299999999999
that

4644.6 --> 4650.84
why would you completely take it away

4647.3 --> 4653.1990000000005
it just needs to be clearly defined as

4650.84 --> 4653.1990000000005
fiction

4655.1 --> 4660.9800000000005
like this is fiction enjoy the fiction

4659.0 --> 4663.14
you could think of it as real but it is

4660.98 --> 4665.599999999999
fiction

4663.14 --> 4667.46
do that and that will fix like a whole

4665.6 --> 4668.14
bunch of things and we can have

4667.46 --> 4672.38
um

4668.14 --> 4675.7390000000005
amazing amazing surreal entertainment

4672.38 --> 4678.1990000000005
space movies man space look really if

4675.739 --> 4681.699
you really think about it space movies

4678.199 --> 4681.699
are freaking miracles

4682.58 --> 4688.28
like that's miraculous

4685.219 --> 4690.92
they literally make something that's so

4688.28 --> 4695.36
freaking realistic looking

4690.92 --> 4698.2390000000005
in a situation that literally was made

4695.36 --> 4701.12
up out of thin air because it never

4698.239 --> 4702.739
existed anywhere it was creatively

4701.12 --> 4706.099999999999
assembled

4702.739 --> 4707.959999999999
from three thinking people that made

4706.1 --> 4710.06
that in secret

4707.96 --> 4712.04
and then used math to put it all

4710.06 --> 4713.6
together and sort of make it work

4712.04 --> 4716.36
because they could never get it to work

4713.6 --> 4718.280000000001
foolproof of course with physics

4716.36 --> 4719.239
but they could make it mathematically

4718.28 --> 4721.34
fit

4719.239 --> 4723.5
that was their trick like they didn't

4721.34 --> 4725.679
use physics they used math to make it

4723.5 --> 4725.679
work

4728.0 --> 4731.9
and it's amazing to me

4730.699 --> 4736.28
like

4731.9 --> 4739.699
what what they made believable I think

4736.28 --> 4742.28
I'm truly like in awe of it in a way is

4739.699 --> 4745.0599999999995
like wow I can just watch this

4742.28 --> 4748.219
Space movie and it's just like

4745.06 --> 4749.780000000001
whoa I really believe it's real when I

4748.219 --> 4752.54
watch that stuff

4749.78 --> 4754.159
like I believe that it can be real it

4752.54 --> 4756.739
feels real

4754.159 --> 4758.9
a lot of the time

4756.739 --> 4761.36
most of the time now with the good the

4758.9 --> 4763.94
modern space movies with the good CGI it

4761.36 --> 4766.699
looks just so real

4763.94 --> 4768.799999999999
feels so it just

4766.699 --> 4771.0199999999995
and I mean like in the 90s in the 80s

4768.8 --> 4774.26
they had space stuff and two but it with

4771.02 --> 4776.900000000001
like more props and then it felt more

4774.26 --> 4779.4400000000005
like like it was just toys right it was

4776.9 --> 4782.839999999999
just like oh this is a nice expensive

4779.44 --> 4785.78
and now it just looks like oh my God it

4782.84 --> 4789.02
looks so freaking real man

4785.78 --> 4791.599999999999
but it's completely made up like it is

4789.02 --> 4793.9400000000005
something that never existed and just

4791.6 --> 4797.719
look at how convincing they made that

4793.94 --> 4800.96
thing that never existed it's amazing

4797.719 --> 4804.219
it's astounding to me

4800.96 --> 4804.219
that that's possible

4804.26 --> 4810.02
It's Magic it's literal magic of the

4807.199 --> 4812.799999999999
mind it is it is Magic of the mind that

4810.02 --> 4812.8
that works

4814.1 --> 4818.96
100 hours into start yeah well that's

4816.44 --> 4821.599999999999
another example I mean that's Space

4818.96 --> 4823.76
games these days are like very realistic

4821.6 --> 4825.679
they are probably what we all dreamed of

4823.76 --> 4828.7390000000005
20 years ago

4825.679 --> 4833.36
well 3D oh we could have in space

4828.739 --> 4835.879999999999
finally 3D I wanna I wanna do Star Wars

4833.36 --> 4838.28
in space getting my TIE fighter and

4835.88 --> 4840.679
shoot at Death Star Destroyers and all

4838.28 --> 4843.5
that like dude

4840.679 --> 4844.88
we were all wanting that

4843.5 --> 4848.3
right

4844.88 --> 4849.86
so I get it these these games now I I

4848.3 --> 4851.3
never really get into them though

4849.86 --> 4854.659
personally

4851.3 --> 4857.179
but man did I long in that late 90s for

4854.659 --> 4859.82
like a real 3D

4857.179 --> 4862.58
Star Wars space Shooters and stuff I

4859.82 --> 4865.88
longed for that stuff

4862.58 --> 4869.84
But as time passed

4865.88 --> 4872.3
I kind of like yeah other like

4869.84 --> 4876.08
I got more I got caught up by the real

4872.3 --> 4879.92
world things and Alex Jones and all that

4876.08 --> 4881.739
that yeah which is very

4879.92 --> 4884.4800000000005
very gripping

4881.739 --> 4886.599999999999
or at least he was very much at that

4884.48 --> 4886.599999999999
time

4886.82 --> 4889.0
foreign

4890.659 --> 4898.659
but I mean yeah are there really good

4893.78 --> 4898.659
Star Wars space Shooters now

4898.94 --> 4905.44
or is it like more focused on just

4901.46 --> 4905.44
lightsaber Jedi stuff

4914.239 --> 4921.5599999999995
I never wanting to fly through space why

4918.32 --> 4924.92
one in a computer game

4921.56 --> 4927.14
I don't actually physically want to fly

4924.92 --> 4931.1
through space well because it doesn't

4927.14 --> 4933.14
exist and we all know what a vacuum does

4931.1 --> 4935.06
what's

4933.14 --> 4938.02
you weren't in the Star Wars oh okay

4935.06 --> 4938.02
fine

4949.19 --> 4952.389999999999
[Music]

4953.62 --> 4958.46
I just think

4955.64 --> 4960.7390000000005
like these types of things right

4958.46 --> 4963.199
because every time there's like a space

4960.739 --> 4966.139999999999
battle in a movie or even in a game

4963.199 --> 4968.739
going on every time in my mind what I'm

4966.14 --> 4971.12
doing is I'm comparing I'm comparing

4968.739 --> 4973.218999999999
what it looks like

4971.12 --> 4976.219
and it's always because in my mind it's

4973.219 --> 4978.32
like logically based on

4976.219 --> 4981.679
Naval Warfare

4978.32 --> 4982.9
yeah Outer Space Battles are like Naval

4981.679 --> 4985.58
Warfare

4982.9 --> 4988.159
and even in the Star Wars movie they've

4985.58 --> 4989.239
done this consistently they presented as

4988.159 --> 4992.48
such right

4989.239 --> 4994.099999999999
the ships all hang around with the same

4992.48 --> 4996.678999999999
side up

4994.1 --> 4998.0
there's always a virtual up even though

4996.679 --> 5000.46
there technically isn't like there might

4998.0 --> 5003.58
be the planet there and then the Star

5000.46 --> 5006.76
Destroyers and they're all like pointing

5003.58 --> 5008.04
at the same side up because

5006.76 --> 5012.219
it's

5008.04 --> 5014.08
intuitively based on Naval Warfare

5012.219 --> 5016.54
and so I'm always looking at the

5014.08 --> 5018.46
pictures like how does this how is this

5016.54 --> 5020.98
Lent from Neville because it's never

5018.46 --> 5024.4800000000005
just all the ships all are all just

5020.98 --> 5024.48
chaotically parked

5024.58 --> 5030.4
they rarely do that

5026.86 --> 5032.08
because it just gives weird freaky this

5030.4 --> 5035.259999999999
or vertigo

5032.08 --> 5038.14
like that induces vertigo when you look

5035.26 --> 5040.2390000000005
at it and it's interesting because there

5038.14 --> 5042.280000000001
is an example of that actually Star Wars

5040.239 --> 5045.5199999999995
never really does they always like make

5042.28 --> 5047.259999999999
it look like Naval Warfare with warping

5045.52 --> 5049.0
in and all the same sides up and all

5047.26 --> 5051.400000000001
that never chaotic

5049.0 --> 5054.64
in the place where they did do that was

5051.4 --> 5058.299999999999
Babylon 5. in the later parts of the

5054.64 --> 5063.06
series especially with the Great War

5058.3 --> 5063.06
or like the the shadows and the

5063.1 --> 5068.679
any other ones go at it

5065.26 --> 5071.14
and then it's chaos and and then

5068.679 --> 5072.9400000000005
yeah it gets pointing in all directions

5071.14 --> 5076.12
and [ __ ]

5072.94 --> 5078.639999999999
but that induces vertigo to the viewer

5076.12 --> 5081.699
you see it's a side effect it's a side

5078.64 --> 5084.58
effect that's basically caused by the

5081.699 --> 5087.82
this cohesion of the spell that's being

5084.58 --> 5089.62
cast because if there's no logical

5087.82 --> 5092.259999999999
reference if all the ships are not

5089.62 --> 5095.32
pointing with the Satan side up

5092.26 --> 5097.0
it'll make it will induce this vertigo

5095.32 --> 5100.08
to The Watcher

5097.0 --> 5102.52
because now they can't

5100.08 --> 5106.48
subconsciously reference frame it all

5102.52 --> 5109.320000000001
like it's a naval Warfare scenario

5106.48 --> 5109.32
oh that works

5109.659 --> 5116.139999999999
I pay attention to this stuff I'm

5112.36 --> 5120.04
fascinated by it I'm fascinated by how

5116.14 --> 5123.58
the spell makes it seem real what things

5120.04 --> 5124.719
is it using in its setup to create that

5123.58 --> 5127.42
right

5124.719 --> 5130.42
and hey like even things like Star Trek

5127.42 --> 5131.1990000000005
and all that they employ it too they do

5130.42 --> 5133.659
it

5131.199 --> 5135.58
I've actually seen it around much more

5133.659 --> 5138.159
effectively I don't like Star Trek the

5135.58 --> 5141.1
series is nearly as much as I did like

5138.159 --> 5143.799999999999
Star Wars franchise overall though the

5141.1 --> 5148.659000000001
modern newer Star Wars things are like

5143.8 --> 5148.659000000001
series are not super great but

5148.84 --> 5154.42
in Star Trek series I've always noticed

5151.239 --> 5157.239
that you really know how to use the

5154.42 --> 5160.54
atmosphere the emotional atmosphere and

5157.239 --> 5162.638999999999
they do like on purpose try to induce

5160.54 --> 5165.46
the vertigo sometimes it's like super

5162.639 --> 5167.56
chaotic situation and then you they on

5165.46 --> 5169.96
purpose they show the ships going all

5167.56 --> 5171.6990000000005
directions in all orientations like

5169.96 --> 5174.1
completely chaos

5171.699 --> 5175.9
because you're supposed to get a

5174.1 --> 5177.88
vertical because somebody's like trying

5175.9 --> 5180.4
to escape and it's like very dangerous

5177.88 --> 5183.9400000000005
things exploding behind him they want

5180.4 --> 5184.9
you to have like so they create the

5183.94 --> 5187.299999999999
chaos

5184.9 --> 5189.099999999999
when at the start of it there was no

5187.3 --> 5191.9800000000005
chaos it's like oh

5189.1 --> 5194.139
we're we're might engage

5191.98 --> 5196.48
well they're all pointing the same the

5194.139 --> 5199.2390000000005
right side up so you have the naval

5196.48 --> 5202.178999999999
reference it's stable then the battle

5199.239 --> 5204.58
happens and it goes like this and this

5202.179 --> 5207.34
and it reminds you of jet fighters right

5204.58 --> 5210.5199999999995
flying and going at each other's

5207.34 --> 5212.38
and then eventually like all the ships

5210.52 --> 5214.360000000001
crash into each other like it really

5212.38 --> 5216.6990000000005
gets destroyed

5214.36 --> 5219.219
people try to get away Escape whatever

5216.699 --> 5223.44
and then you get some vertical

5219.219 --> 5223.44
situations and they do that on purpose

5223.48 --> 5227.159
I'm fascinated by this

5227.98 --> 5231.879999999999
space you with yo-yo

5230.8 --> 5234.28
yeah

5231.88 --> 5235.96
or in real space you're literally it's

5234.28 --> 5239.0199999999995
it should be feeling like you're

5235.96 --> 5241.659
perpetually falling it's the abyss

5239.02 --> 5244.0
if you would actually experience what

5241.659 --> 5247.719
they say it would be like

5244.0 --> 5248.739
it would literally be like you're in the

5247.719 --> 5252.46
black

5248.739 --> 5256.36
falling forever

5252.46 --> 5257.86
would you like to experience that

5256.36 --> 5259.78
would you

5257.86 --> 5261.82
huh

5259.78 --> 5265.42
Eternal Black around you

5261.82 --> 5267.5199999999995
feeling like you're falling forever

5265.42 --> 5271.659
yes

5267.52 --> 5271.659000000001
what a great idea

5272.5 --> 5274.719
um

5273.34 --> 5277.12
laughs

5274.719 --> 5279.54
no

5277.12 --> 5279.54
no no no no no

5282.639 --> 5284.639
no no no

5292.96 --> 5296.699
but it's fascinating though

5298.0 --> 5303.76
a falling motion though no no no no no

5300.699 --> 5307.659
no no no don't you see

5303.76 --> 5310.84
acceleration you will feel

5307.659 --> 5313.659
permanent acceleration Evie it's not a

5310.84 --> 5315.6990000000005
steady speed fall it there's no air to

5313.659 --> 5318.28
stop you know it will feel like you're

5315.699 --> 5320.259999999999
accelerating forever Evie that's the

5318.28 --> 5323.639
point

5320.26 --> 5326.38
a fall feeling that will never go away

5323.639 --> 5329.02
you will it feels like you never stop

5326.38 --> 5331.36
accelerating it's while you're

5329.02 --> 5334.540000000001
surrounded by black I mean I can't think

5331.36 --> 5337.9
of more terrifying idea I mean that's

5334.54 --> 5339.94
literally to me like that's the abyss

5337.9 --> 5344.159
that's the abyss that you're gonna be

5339.94 --> 5344.159
feeling that's so [ __ ] up

5345.699 --> 5349.739
right

5347.199 --> 5354.219
I mean falling in a black hole forever

5349.739 --> 5356.739
for like the endless pit

5354.219 --> 5359.5
that's it it's outer space it's the

5356.739 --> 5360.759999999999
endless pit you fall forever in absolute

5359.5 --> 5365.679
black

5360.76 --> 5365.679
does that seem like a nice idea no

5366.219 --> 5370.7390000000005
to actually experience no but I mean

5370.9 --> 5377.638999999999
to play around in

5373.06 --> 5377.639
like a video game freaking awesome

5378.58 --> 5382.659
you wouldn't

5380.139 --> 5386.1990000000005
no no you would

5382.659 --> 5387.46
the point is Evie come on Evie you

5386.199 --> 5389.799999999999
should know this

5387.46 --> 5393.159
when we're on Earth

5389.8 --> 5394.900000000001
we're subjected to the gravity or

5393.159 --> 5397.78
whatever don't even get me into this I'm

5394.9 --> 5399.82
I'm going by Baldwin standards well not

5397.78 --> 5401.5
even I'm going by official standards you

5399.82 --> 5404.0199999999995
get the gravity pull

5401.5 --> 5406.54
but when you escape the gravity pool

5404.02 --> 5408.34
because you're out of the atmosphere and

5406.54 --> 5411.699
you're far away enough

5408.34 --> 5413.32
then suddenly well you don't have that

5411.699 --> 5415.48
thing pulling on you

5413.32 --> 5417.96
so it then starts to feel like you're

5415.48 --> 5417.959999999999
falling

5418.84 --> 5425.02
like some things

5421.78 --> 5427.42
yeah it feels like falling forever

5425.02 --> 5429.6990000000005
I'm sorry that's literally how they

5427.42 --> 5431.4400000000005
describe that

5429.699 --> 5434.5599999999995
right

5431.44 --> 5436.36
zero g what is that thing well you're

5434.56 --> 5439.3
literally falling

5436.36 --> 5441.94
but without the air friction to

5439.3 --> 5443.9800000000005
stabilize your speed you see

5441.94 --> 5445.839999999999
that's the point

5443.98 --> 5448.0599999999995
when you fall you got the terminal

5445.84 --> 5450.42
velocity what is that that's where the

5448.06 --> 5453.52
friction of the air

5450.42 --> 5456.34
causes your acceleration to slow down

5453.52 --> 5458.7390000000005
and reach a steady speed

5456.34 --> 5461.56
well that doesn't happen

5458.739 --> 5462.879999999999
in a vomit Comet they specifically make

5461.56 --> 5465.580000000001
sure that it doesn't

5462.88 --> 5468.52
and it's not supposed to happen in space

5465.58 --> 5471.82
so you literally feel like you're

5468.52 --> 5475.5
accelerating forever that's the point

5471.82 --> 5475.5
that's how it's supposed to be

5477.9 --> 5483.58
yeah that's literally what it is Evie

5481.36 --> 5486.699
I'm sorry if you don't understand that's

5483.58 --> 5489.659
how it works it really is

5486.699 --> 5489.659
it's official

5494.92 --> 5499.2390000000005
okay

5497.139 --> 5500.89
that's not how it's supposed to be oh

5499.239 --> 5503.0199999999995
really akumu virus explain

5500.89 --> 5506.159000000001
[Music]

5503.02 --> 5506.159000000001
oh God

5507.699 --> 5516.78
where did I get that I figured it out as

5511.239 --> 5516.78
Baldwin in the last 30 years Akuma virus

5517.12 --> 5523.599999999999
watched a lot of baller talk on TV I

5521.32 --> 5526.179
asked a lot of questions to my physics

5523.6 --> 5530.280000000001
teachers I asked I was into that [ __ ]

5526.179 --> 5530.28
dude I was into it a lot

5536.92 --> 5542.639
things like Voyager want to do what what

5540.159 --> 5542.638999999999
about it

5545.26 --> 5550.7390000000005
they didn't accelerate infinitely what

5548.02 --> 5550.7390000000005
are you talking about

5559.3 --> 5564.639
are you talking about how it's supposed

5561.94 --> 5568.138999999999
to have worked with Voyager 1 and 2

5564.639 --> 5570.82
because in reality it's just yeah

5568.139 --> 5572.62
suppose it's satellite or whatever or

5570.82 --> 5574.9
maybe not even that

5572.62 --> 5577.0
it's just a rocket being dumped it's

5574.9 --> 5579.299999999999
just going in an arc and Bloom in the

5577.0 --> 5579.3
Pacific

5579.88 --> 5586.12
or in the Bermuda Triangle or whatever

5583.3 --> 5588.6990000000005
is gone that's what they do

5586.12 --> 5590.92
nothing actually went anywhere but are

5588.699 --> 5593.5
you or are you talking theoretically how

5590.92 --> 5595.4800000000005
that's supposed to work

5593.5 --> 5599.44
with these supposed satellites getting

5595.48 --> 5602.879999999999
sent out to communicate life we have

5599.44 --> 5602.879999999999
we're living people here

5609.76 --> 5614.5
they didn't accelerate infinite yeah but

5612.159 --> 5616.299999999999
there's not Evie the point is if

5614.5 --> 5618.28
something travels in space freely

5616.3 --> 5620.860000000001
without getting caught in orbits of

5618.28 --> 5623.259999999999
planets or Suns or whatever

5620.86 --> 5626.139
okay

5623.26 --> 5627.639
well not Sun that's not relevant planet

5626.139 --> 5630.28
planet planet planetary orbits are

5627.639 --> 5633.1
really relevant or yeah close by the sun

5630.28 --> 5637.44
we would burn up the point is is

5633.1 --> 5637.4400000000005
there's nothing to stop the acceleration

5638.08 --> 5644.219
in free space floaty space without

5641.08 --> 5644.219
anything pulling

5645.82 --> 5649.84
there's nothing to stop the X like as

5648.4 --> 5651.759999999999
long as you're accelerated Nothing is

5649.84 --> 5655.0
Stopping as soon as you basically turn

5651.76 --> 5657.639
on the acceleratory device which is

5655.0 --> 5659.5
supposed to beat a rocket in a vacuum

5657.639 --> 5660.46
whatever let's just imagine that that

5659.5 --> 5663.58
works

5660.46 --> 5666.88
yeah as soon as the rocket stops firing

5663.58 --> 5669.4
the acceleration doesn't increase but

5666.88 --> 5670.679
the speed will remain there because

5669.4 --> 5673.78
there's nothing

5670.679 --> 5674.9800000000005
breaking it like

5673.78 --> 5677.139
uh

5674.98 --> 5680.58
pulling it pulling its speed down

5677.139 --> 5680.58
there's no friction from anything

5686.739 --> 5690.759999999999
there's nothing to make the Excel it

5689.199 --> 5694.239
doesn't matter no it doesn't accelerate

5690.76 --> 5695.4400000000005
any further then it will just retain its

5694.239 --> 5698.44
speed

5695.44 --> 5700.9
until it's there's a break until there's

5698.44 --> 5703.239
counter acceleration

5700.9 --> 5705.839999999999
there's a push the other direction to

5703.239 --> 5705.839999999999
slow it down

5713.86 --> 5720.339999999999
right yeah Kuma virus seems to get it

5718.239 --> 5723.12
that's how it works out there supposedly

5720.34 --> 5723.12
in outer space

5726.219 --> 5732.76
right nothing is there's nothing in

5728.56 --> 5735.52
space to slow you down is the idea

5732.76 --> 5736.96
once you catch some insane speed you

5735.52 --> 5740.38
will go forever there's nothing that

5736.96 --> 5743.44
could stop you unless you have thrusters

5740.38 --> 5746.88
to to point in the other direction and

5743.44 --> 5746.879999999999
hope to slow you down

5754.98 --> 5760.48
accelerations edit just thrust it's

5758.56 --> 5762.1
supposedly through thrust you can't

5760.48 --> 5765.099999999999
accelerate

5762.1 --> 5767.02
in space without thrust

5765.1 --> 5769.06
even though that actually doesn't work

5767.02 --> 5771.820000000001
the only thing that really works in

5769.06 --> 5775.780000000001
space logically is momentum right you

5771.82 --> 5778.599999999999
need pressure to create thrust but

5775.78 --> 5781.9
yeah they chose to like

5778.6 --> 5784.0
just screw it we're gonna make it we got

5781.9 --> 5789.179
special nozzles and it's pushing against

5784.0 --> 5789.179
itself okay NASA okay sure

5796.659 --> 5800.5599999999995
yeah

5798.76 --> 5802.12
that's why I always wonder like why

5800.56 --> 5805.3
didn't they test that why didn't they

5802.12 --> 5809.38
take those like Saturn Rockets they use

5805.3 --> 5813.88
Rockets engines and like I don't know

5809.38 --> 5817.900000000001
put it in the vacuum chamber that really

5813.88 --> 5821.4400000000005
giant one put the rockets in there and

5817.9 --> 5824.92
see how well they create thrust

5821.44 --> 5827.199
in that Mega vacuum chamber oh yeah

5824.92 --> 5830.4400000000005
that's isn't that exactly what it should

5827.199 --> 5833.799999999999
be tested for I mean seriously

5830.44 --> 5836.86
but they've never done that as far as I

5833.8 --> 5839.08
know I've never heard of that being done

5836.86 --> 5841.78
and if they did they certainly didn't

5839.08 --> 5844.0199999999995
show it to us with video footage did

5841.78 --> 5844.0199999999995
they

5844.6 --> 5847.96
maybe they couldn't because they

5846.28 --> 5850.96
couldn't get a camera to actually

5847.96 --> 5853.4800000000005
function in that vacuum chamber

5850.96 --> 5855.3
even though they get did get it to work

5853.48 --> 5857.62
on the moon

5855.3 --> 5859.3
right there might be all kinds of

5857.62 --> 5862.12
complications maybe they built that

5859.3 --> 5865.78
vacuum chamber specifically

5862.12 --> 5868.179
because they wanted to do that they were

5865.78 --> 5869.92
like logically thinking yeah we gotta

5868.179 --> 5871.96
have a big vacuum chamber to test our

5869.92 --> 5875.56
Saturn Rockets right

5871.96 --> 5879.34
see how well they work in space

5875.56 --> 5882.219
but then last days like okay let's do

5879.34 --> 5883.78
the test it's like it's not working [ __ ]

5882.219 --> 5886.3
okay

5883.78 --> 5888.46
let's try another design yeah it's not

5886.3 --> 5891.34
working [ __ ]

5888.46 --> 5892.8
okay well can we get the camera to work

5891.34 --> 5895.0
at least

5892.8 --> 5898.360000000001
yeah we're trying all these different

5895.0 --> 5901.0
things it's not working it's like [ __ ]

5898.36 --> 5904.0
it's not nothing's working damn it screw

5901.0 --> 5907.12
it we're not we never did this

5904.0 --> 5909.06
we never did these tests we just built a

5907.12 --> 5912.4
vacuum chamber just for the hell of it

5909.06 --> 5915.1
yes I mean

5912.4 --> 5917.08
this never happened we never tested

5915.1 --> 5918.639
these Rockets or the cameras in this big

5917.08 --> 5922.179
vacuum chamber

5918.639 --> 5924.400000000001
we just build it because we thought yeah

5922.179 --> 5925.54
just randomly build a huge vacuum

5924.4 --> 5928.44
chamber

5925.54 --> 5928.44
laughs

5928.6 --> 5932.5
yes metal slugs crocodile you didn't

5930.94 --> 5935.259999999999
know

5932.5 --> 5938.02
NASA has the biggest vacuum chamber on

5935.26 --> 5941.34
Earth it's enormous

5938.02 --> 5941.34
it's like a warehouse

5948.52 --> 5951.780000000001
it's huge

5952.12 --> 5958.36
and it's [ __ ] up I mean the vacuum in

5955.659 --> 5959.5
that is really heavy it's or like while

5958.36 --> 5962.0199999999995
it's really

5959.5 --> 5964.36
it's the strongest vacuum that has ever

5962.02 --> 5966.639
been created it's of course nothing even

5964.36 --> 5970.839999999999
close to the supposed vacuum of outer

5966.639 --> 5973.719
space right what it's so enormous that

5970.84 --> 5977.219
like that building like when they it's

5973.719 --> 5977.219
dangerous for the entire building

5978.1 --> 5983.4400000000005
a vacuum that large well the risk of

5981.639 --> 5985.36
that entire building collapsing is

5983.44 --> 5988.9
enormous that's why it's basically just

5985.36 --> 5992.799999999999
one gigantic concrete wall

5988.9 --> 5992.799999999999
it's just insane

5993.82 --> 5998.139
it's a giant hole in a mountain or

5996.4 --> 5999.94
something I don't know exactly where it

5998.139 --> 6002.6990000000005
is but it's the biggest vacuum chamber

5999.94 --> 6006.299999999999
ever they probably build it originally

6002.699 --> 6008.638999999999
to to logically test Rockets right test

6006.3 --> 6011.400000000001
the rocket engine for in the vacuum

6008.639 --> 6013.1990000000005
and then they never ever got one of

6011.4 --> 6015.48
those Rockets to actually work in a

6013.199 --> 6018.48
vacuum and neither did they with any

6015.48 --> 6022.159
cameras so there's like okay we can't

6018.48 --> 6025.5199999999995
leave this on the record

6022.159 --> 6029.12
so we never did these tests

6025.52 --> 6032.34
we just have a giant vacuum chamber yeah

6029.12 --> 6035.88
we never did any rocket tests there no

6032.34 --> 6037.679
really because they just work yeah

6035.88 --> 6040.5
it just work

6037.679 --> 6042.54
that's what I think really happened

6040.5 --> 6044.46
and why it's there

6042.54 --> 6046.44
where they barely ever used it

6044.46 --> 6048.96
supposedly

6046.44 --> 6051.178999999999
because when they did they found out

6048.96 --> 6053.58
that nothing worked in a vacuum like

6051.179 --> 6056.28
they can't get anything to work nothing

6053.58 --> 6058.5
works in vacuum chemical reactions that

6056.28 --> 6059.639
work in a vacuum Fire doesn't work in a

6058.5 --> 6061.62
vacuum

6059.639 --> 6065.6990000000005
like they can't even get thermite to

6061.62 --> 6068.58
burn in a vacuum and thermite is like

6065.699 --> 6070.08
like nothing can stop thermite from

6068.58 --> 6073.679
burning

6070.08 --> 6075.719
except the vacuum it's not even joking

6073.679 --> 6079.38
guys you can't get a you can't get it to

6075.719 --> 6083.4
burn and the oxygen is in the thermite

6079.38 --> 6085.1990000000005
you can't get it to burn in a vacuum you

6083.4 --> 6086.5199999999995
can't do it

6085.199 --> 6089.638999999999
okay

6086.52 --> 6092.6990000000005
nothing can stop thermite from burning

6089.639 --> 6095.1
literally nothing well maybe water if it

6092.699 --> 6095.699
gets wet

6095.1 --> 6098.58
um

6095.699 --> 6100.08
but other than it getting wet

6098.58 --> 6103.26
nothing

6100.08 --> 6104.4
oh by the way if it's already burning

6103.26 --> 6106.860000000001
no

6104.4 --> 6109.619
like even if you like have the thermite

6106.86 --> 6112.199
like a whole bunch of it and you burn it

6109.619 --> 6114.599999999999
if you pour water on that it doesn't

6112.199 --> 6116.339999999999
care it'll literally evaporate the water

6114.6 --> 6119.46
and just continue burning right because

6116.34 --> 6121.5
nothing can stop thermite burning once

6119.46 --> 6126.06
it gets going

6121.5 --> 6129.3
except the vacuum yeah nothing

6126.06 --> 6132.6
can stop ceramide from burning nothing

6129.3 --> 6134.88
yeah think of it nothing can once it

6132.6 --> 6136.320000000001
burns nothing can make it stop except

6134.88 --> 6140.76
for one thing

6136.32 --> 6144.199
a vacuum okay that's very telling

6140.76 --> 6144.1990000000005
very very telling

6147.48 --> 6152.58
chemical reactions still work no they

6149.82 --> 6155.659
don't akumu virus that's the funny thing

6152.58 --> 6155.659
about it they don't

6157.38 --> 6164.28
yeah thermite has oxygen in it it's

6162.06 --> 6165.96
literally

6164.28 --> 6168.119
rust

6165.96 --> 6170.96
iron oxide

6168.119 --> 6173.88
and

6170.96 --> 6176.1
the another Catalyst thing I don't

6173.88 --> 6178.1990000000005
remember what it was but that that's

6176.1 --> 6181.219
what it does right the oxygen is

6178.199 --> 6181.219
literally in it

6181.5 --> 6186.9
that's what it like it doesn't

6182.94 --> 6189.299999999999
technically need the oxygen right in the

6186.9 --> 6190.92
air it's not burning that thermite

6189.3 --> 6192.6
doesn't burn the oxygen in the air

6190.92 --> 6195.0
because it doesn't need it you see it

6192.6 --> 6198.119000000001
get it is in the substance

6195.0 --> 6200.639
what it does need however

6198.119 --> 6202.5
is pressure

6200.639 --> 6204.4800000000005
it doesn't need the oxygen it needs the

6202.5 --> 6206.34
pressure you see

6204.48 --> 6209.218999999999
without the pressure

6206.34 --> 6211.26
it can't react

6209.219 --> 6213.2390000000005
it can have all the oxygen in the world

6211.26 --> 6215.58
but it won't react

6213.239 --> 6219.419999999999
that's the bizarre thing about it that's

6215.58 --> 6222.84
why it's just utterly impossible to get

6219.42 --> 6224.76
a rocket in a vacuum to work it can't

6222.84 --> 6227.1
it can't

6224.76 --> 6228.84
if it's really a vacuum it just don't

6227.1 --> 6231.3
doesn't work anymore it needs pressure

6228.84 --> 6233.719
to work if it doesn't work without

6231.3 --> 6233.719
pressure

6239.4 --> 6244.138999999999
what

6242.06 --> 6247.400000000001
constantly not letting what are you

6244.139 --> 6247.400000000001
talking about Evie

6253.44 --> 6258.48
you know metal just water what

6261.06 --> 6267.860000000001
oh metal slugs cockatiel Nate oh you

6264.0 --> 6267.86
talk about nothing else whatever

6268.94 --> 6273.54
Nathan is a primer yeah that's but he

6271.44 --> 6274.739
always has a Premiere going Evie that's

6273.54 --> 6278.34
standard

6274.739 --> 6280.86
yeah who cares

6278.34 --> 6282.6
I'm in the live show here he always has

6280.86 --> 6285.599999999999
a premiere

6282.6 --> 6288.780000000001
like after my first hour of my show in

6285.6 --> 6291.54
the weekends so what

6288.78 --> 6293.219
not everybody likes my show some people

6291.54 --> 6295.44
really want to watch The Flat Earth

6293.219 --> 6299.54
debate premieres so let them watch The

6295.44 --> 6299.54
Flat Earth debate premieres right

6302.54 --> 6309.44
yeah who cares this is a live show you

6305.76 --> 6309.4400000000005
can be here right now and watch it

6311.159 --> 6316.08
don't

6312.96 --> 6318.42
they don't need people to be like oh

6316.08 --> 6322.5199999999995
those people are competing with our

6318.42 --> 6322.52
winner I know dude

6323.76 --> 6326.900000000001
don't worry about it

6335.1 --> 6341.719
besides the premiere is probably about a

6337.679 --> 6341.719
show that I am on too right

6342.0 --> 6349.08
I get really good parts like on the FED

6346.34 --> 6350.88
especially in the after show I I really

6349.08 --> 6352.98
have good parts yes they have a really

6350.88 --> 6357.139
great great elaborate discussion in

6352.98 --> 6357.138999999999
which I was very dominant by the way

6358.02 --> 6362.820000000001
I made my stand and all that and like

6360.54 --> 6366.36
got it through got the ideas through and

6362.82 --> 6370.139
eventually we all were the wiser I

6366.36 --> 6373.639
so looking forward to that premiere

6370.139 --> 6373.639
Halo fruit good to see you

6374.46 --> 6379.92
you treats me like crap on this show

6376.32 --> 6383.219
yeah sometimes I feel like that Evie

6379.92 --> 6385.08
thanks for yeah I don't need anybody to

6383.219 --> 6386.82
emphasize that hey and I make public

6385.08 --> 6389.94
complaints about it

6386.82 --> 6391.799999999999
and Nathan knows I mean I think it's

6389.94 --> 6393.78
just kind of a weird force of habit or

6391.8 --> 6395.1
something they just all like oh yeah of

6393.78 --> 6397.08
course our win and then I have to get

6395.1 --> 6400.26
pissed off again so they realize oh wait

6397.08 --> 6403.04
yeah uh okay

6400.26 --> 6403.04
I don't know

6408.6 --> 6416.34
and besides if I not show up anymore

6412.56 --> 6419.52
they just start to treat Brian like me

6416.34 --> 6423.38
I'm like the Irish Irish

6419.52 --> 6423.38
nah but Ryan doesn't treat me like that

6426.179 --> 6430.8
but they have like yeah this really

6429.06 --> 6433.26
weird comparison anyway I do feel

6430.8 --> 6435.360000000001
sometimes like I'm just not the actual

6433.26 --> 6437.159000000001
English guy like they treat me like I'm

6435.36 --> 6439.5
not actually English

6437.159 --> 6441.42
I don't know what it is

6439.5 --> 6444.239
but other times

6441.42 --> 6446.1
it also depends just on the quality of

6444.239 --> 6447.659
how I'm talking you know because my

6446.1 --> 6449.639
quality what comes out of me isn't

6447.659 --> 6452.46
always super consistent sometimes I'm

6449.639 --> 6453.84
just kind of like I just stumble over my

6452.46 --> 6455.699
own tongue where I can't find the right

6453.84 --> 6457.02
words and it ruins what I'm trying to

6455.699 --> 6459.0599999999995
say

6457.02 --> 6461.639
and then it's annoying

6459.06 --> 6464.04
and other times I'm super sharp and I

6461.639 --> 6467.0
just like way quicker

6464.04 --> 6467.0
than everybody else

6468.06 --> 6474.119000000001
so yeah

6470.88 --> 6476.82
what I roll out on the show fed is some

6474.119 --> 6481.4
is mixed sometimes I'm kind of stumbly

6476.82 --> 6481.4
other times I'm super super Sharp

6483.32 --> 6488.099999999999
belittling me and Neil yeah well I don't

6486.0 --> 6490.619
I don't like that either like I don't

6488.1 --> 6492.96
it's really assign it I find it actually

6490.619 --> 6494.4
insulting that he Compares me to Neil

6492.96 --> 6497.219
like that

6494.4 --> 6500.699
because when I interrupt I really

6497.219 --> 6503.219
interrupt with actual points that are

6500.699 --> 6504.659
relevant and not just regurgitation of

6503.219 --> 6506.28
things that everybody already knows

6504.659 --> 6509.179
about

6506.28 --> 6509.179
that's the difference

6511.679 --> 6515.0
but uh yeah whatever

6527.42 --> 6534.08
in you are your favorites okay I could

6530.88 --> 6534.08
move Vibes thanks for that

6534.239 --> 6537.44
again in second

6541.92 --> 6548.58
hey weren't you in there earlier

6545.52 --> 6551.2390000000005
yeah you were in here

6548.58 --> 6551.239
hello

6567.96 --> 6573.96
man getting sick has been like

6571.26 --> 6575.76
here for a long time

6573.96 --> 6579.659
give me a sick why didn't you hear like

6575.76 --> 6581.52
since 2017 or something

6579.659 --> 6583.5599999999995
I'm not sure anymore

6581.52 --> 6584.9400000000005
so much this happened since all that

6583.56 --> 6587.9400000000005
time

6584.94 --> 6591.5
can't believe I'm almost getting around

6587.94 --> 6591.5
to do this like a decade

6594.54 --> 6599.58
there's gonna be doing this for a decade

6596.52 --> 6602.360000000001
can you guys believe that

6599.58 --> 6602.36
wow

6609.96 --> 6615.56
you always sounds like he's yelling from

6612.6 --> 6615.56
20 feet away

6615.98 --> 6619.699
oh yeah he does

6625.619 --> 6633.38
tenth man in the celestial navigation

6627.78 --> 6633.38
Almanac Sexton talk hey but yeah I mean

6634.38 --> 6637.88
it is informative

6648.719 --> 6652.26
got a Gideon Bible

6651.3 --> 6654.860000000001
what

6652.26 --> 6654.860000000001
okay

6679.07 --> 6682.188999999999
[Music]

6684.02 --> 6687.679
let's check the

6687.8 --> 6692.360000000001
the list let's see

6752.699 --> 6755.699
foreign

6757.5 --> 6763.699
that seems like it's all good

6760.56 --> 6763.6990000000005
hey what the [ __ ]

6765.42 --> 6768.4400000000005
how the hell did

6770.52 --> 6776.360000000001
the [ __ ]

6772.26 --> 6776.360000000001
so guns have never owned opening there

6783.84 --> 6790.6990000000005
Arthur B flat what the [ __ ]

6786.96 --> 6790.699
what the hell are they doing in there

6808.5 --> 6814.04
okay

6810.6 --> 6814.04
I'm a good that I checked

6815.1 --> 6817.860000000001
what the hell how the hell did they get

6816.84 --> 6821.400000000001
man

6817.86 --> 6824.48
was an Arthur B flat in here

6821.4 --> 6824.48
in the beginning of the show

6824.88 --> 6830.52
hmm

6826.57 --> 6830.5199999999995
[Music]

6834.5 --> 6841.38
it's here yesterday okay well he was in

6837.9 --> 6844.339999999999
the banned list for some weird reason

6841.38 --> 6844.34
hahaha

6855.54 --> 6861.54
always says you have to let me say this

6858.96 --> 6862.199
right now because I have to leave in a

6861.54 --> 6867.38
minute

6862.199 --> 6867.379999999999
then he says yeah that's tenth man yeah

6877.08 --> 6881.3
I like to see the way they time travel

6884.52 --> 6890.159000000001
you can't physically do time travel

6888.0 --> 6892.199
you can only time travel through the

6890.159 --> 6895.5199999999995
spirit

6892.199 --> 6895.5199999999995
don't recommend it

6895.98 --> 6899.239
it'll [ __ ] you up

6911.28 --> 6916.08
too many creative posts yeah yeah but

6914.34 --> 6918.119000000001
that's yeah it's metal slugs cockatiel

6916.08 --> 6920.04
indeed time travel but that's like the

6918.119 --> 6922.199
I'm because of Einstein right it's the

6920.04 --> 6925.139
Einstein time travel

6922.199 --> 6927.419999999999
where time is like physical and thus it

6925.139 --> 6931.38
can be altered and then oh you can be

6927.42 --> 6933.54
physically somewhere else in the time

6931.38 --> 6936.119
that yeah that's all science fiction all

6933.54 --> 6938.76
came from space-time mending from the

6936.119 --> 6941.299999999999
reification of time as a substance which

6938.76 --> 6941.3
it isn't

6943.44 --> 6948.78
but yeah I mean

6945.78 --> 6950.82
in my experience spiritual time travel

6948.78 --> 6953.46
is actually possible where you can

6950.82 --> 6957.799999999999
attain information

6953.46 --> 6957.8
that is literally not passed yet

6963.3 --> 6969.179
that it doesn't exist yet like that has

6965.639 --> 6971.58
not been designed yet by people you can

6969.179 --> 6975.42
attain information that has not been

6971.58 --> 6977.82
thought up yet in the physical reality

6975.42 --> 6980.639
but that will and they do

6977.82 --> 6983.4
and then you get confronted with the

6980.639 --> 6987.0
Cassandra effect

6983.4 --> 6988.98
because beside knowing what is to be

6987.0 --> 6992.1
there's nothing you could do to change

6988.98 --> 6994.199
it from coming into being if you don't

6992.1 --> 6997.26
like it from coming into being

6994.199 --> 6999.54
or to even do anything in anticipation

6997.26 --> 7003.6990000000005
of it too much

6999.54 --> 7003.699
like you can't become part of it

7004.82 --> 7009.92
you can sit on the side of it

7007.52 --> 7014.139
and like give it an extra push perhaps

7009.92 --> 7014.139
but that's as far as it goes

7015.44 --> 7020.379999999999
but I don't think you're actually

7017.48 --> 7023.0599999999995
interested in actual time travel

7020.38 --> 7024.86
experience based things and more into

7023.06 --> 7027.26
the science fiction of

7024.86 --> 7030.2789999999995
physical time travel

7027.26 --> 7030.279
[Music]

7034.76 --> 7038.780000000001
you know what the dumb thing about

7036.38 --> 7043.150000000001
physical time travel is

7038.78 --> 7046.2699999999995
it never prevents you from getting older

7043.15 --> 7046.2699999999995
[Music]

7050.54 --> 7055.159
was Cassandra and redbrook I don't know

7053.54 --> 7057.46
what the hell

7055.159 --> 7060.679
what does this have to do with red dwarf

7057.46 --> 7064.2390000000005
no Cassandra complex is a classic that's

7060.679 --> 7064.2390000000005
from the Greek mythology

7066.56 --> 7070.84
right that's Greek

7068.239 --> 7070.839999999999
yeah

7074.36 --> 7079.699
Cassandra complex is a official thing

7077.179 --> 7082.58
that's real you could Google that it has

7079.699 --> 7085.94
a Wikipedia page

7082.58 --> 7091.119
and it's philosophy because of course

7085.94 --> 7091.119
they don't actually recognize that

7091.9 --> 7097.219
experiences Beyond normal linear time or

7095.119 --> 7101.259999999999
even a possibility so

7097.219 --> 7101.26
but that's how it is described

7105.699 --> 7111.159
what what are you talking about the food

7111.44 --> 7113.5
um

7115.0 --> 7119.9
String Theory right yeah by the way I'm

7118.219 --> 7122.199
taking a two minute break I'll be right

7119.9 --> 7122.199
back

7123.139 --> 7127.42
because we can have definitely have a

7124.94 --> 7127.419999999999
longer show

7149.3 --> 7152.3
foreign

7224.3 --> 7226.96
foreign

7275.56 --> 7281.360000000001
if you go back in time you simply Place

7278.659 --> 7282.92
yourself in a tall alternate possible

7281.36 --> 7285.5599999999995
reality

7282.92 --> 7288.4400000000005
an infinite amount of possibilities to

7285.56 --> 7292.34
avoid paradox

7288.44 --> 7295.82
okay so we have to determine to

7292.34 --> 7298.76
first if an infinite setup alternative

7295.82 --> 7300.44
timelines exist okay that's hilarious

7298.76 --> 7302.599
metal slugs cockatoo I have a different

7300.44 --> 7304.28
view on that

7302.599 --> 7307.04
and that is

7304.28 --> 7310.699
if there were such a thing as physically

7307.04 --> 7313.82
displacing yourself to another time

7310.699 --> 7317.0
within physical reality then by doing

7313.82 --> 7320.119
that you irrevocably alter reality

7317.0 --> 7322.94
beyond that point in time

7320.119 --> 7325.699
there is no paradox

7322.94 --> 7328.04
once you go back

7325.699 --> 7330.379999999999
you can go back forward

7328.04 --> 7332.78
or well you can but you don't know what

7330.38 --> 7336.38
you're gonna find yourself at

7332.78 --> 7338.9
because as soon as something goes back

7336.38 --> 7342.139
for the ones that stay behind the one

7338.9 --> 7344.719
that goes back is gone forever

7342.139 --> 7347.179
forever they will never be seen again

7344.719 --> 7350.659
ever

7347.179 --> 7352.46
to that person they will go to a

7350.659 --> 7355.339999999999
previous time

7352.46 --> 7357.5
and they will never meet the time that

7355.34 --> 7359.900000000001
they came from ever again they will

7357.5 --> 7361.639
never be able to go back ever like once

7359.9 --> 7366.5199999999995
you go back you can never it's

7361.639 --> 7366.52
physically impossible to ever get back

7366.679 --> 7372.56
you might come across that time you

7370.099 --> 7375.32
might go back forward an amount of time

7372.56 --> 7377.119000000001
equal to where you came from but

7375.32 --> 7379.34
everything will be different it can

7377.119 --> 7382.04
never be the same

7379.34 --> 7385.82
because you altered the past by

7382.04 --> 7389.54
literally coming into being there

7385.82 --> 7391.5199999999995
it's not the same thing anymore

7389.54 --> 7394.219
it's like once you start time traveling

7391.52 --> 7396.92
you can't go back you can only like

7394.219 --> 7399.139
create new realities in which you can

7396.92 --> 7402.139
appear and do things

7399.139 --> 7404.3
you can never go back to anything

7402.139 --> 7406.76
really

7404.3 --> 7409.159000000001
well yeah you can go back to it but by

7406.76 --> 7410.96
going back to it you already irrevocably

7409.159 --> 7414.799999999999
change everything and how it's going to

7410.96 --> 7417.08
be and there can be no paradoxes so once

7414.8 --> 7420.320000000001
you go back to the past there is no

7417.08 --> 7423.139
relevance as to like whoever is there

7420.32 --> 7425.299999999999
even if they were you like technically

7423.139 --> 7427.6990000000005
in my view once you go back to the past

7425.3 --> 7432.320000000001
you can literally find your old self

7427.699 --> 7437.839999999999
there kill them and it wouldn't matter

7432.32 --> 7441.199
because you are an entity on its own

7437.84 --> 7444.860000000001
there is no relation in time

7441.199 --> 7447.32
once you jump you are a new entry you

7444.86 --> 7449.98
have no relation to anything in the time

7447.32 --> 7449.98
that you enter

7455.139 --> 7462.02
I just described your week oh okay I'm

7458.239 --> 7462.0199999999995
getting sick what

7467.9 --> 7472.04
a different timelapse through alteration

7469.94 --> 7474.0199999999995
yes

7472.04 --> 7476.659
okay well glad we agree then because

7474.02 --> 7479.540000000001
that's exactly how my feel on time is

7476.659 --> 7481.82
I even wrote my little science fiction

7479.54 --> 7484.4
short

7481.82 --> 7487.179
my time-based shines fiction short based

7484.4 --> 7487.179
on those principles

7492.92 --> 7499.159
it's like I even said it then I I added

7496.639 --> 7501.619
an alternative and that is that as soon

7499.159 --> 7504.199
as something goes back in time

7501.619 --> 7506.54
physically

7504.199 --> 7507.919999999999
all of reality is instantaneously

7506.54 --> 7510.199
destroyed

7507.92 --> 7512.9
like everything that's left behind

7510.199 --> 7515.32
immediately starts to de-resolute it's

7512.9 --> 7518.5
like it started

7515.32 --> 7518.5
So Gone

7519.199 --> 7523.58
it's like as soon as something time

7521.0 --> 7525.38
travels back everything just

7523.58 --> 7528.28
disintegrates it's like it it

7525.38 --> 7528.28
de-resolates

7528.86 --> 7534.32
because it can't exist anymore if there

7531.8 --> 7536.599
is a direct gun if there is a

7534.32 --> 7538.82
irrevocable connection

7536.599 --> 7541.219
then buy something going back to the

7538.82 --> 7544.42
past that literally makes that current

7541.219 --> 7544.42
no longer possible

7544.639 --> 7550.58
if there is a connection

7546.56 --> 7552.9800000000005
that's how I solved it in my little uh

7550.58 --> 7557.739
science fiction time travel based chart

7552.98 --> 7557.739
that I wrote like in 2015

7560.119 --> 7564.219
I still have it on my computer somewhere

7571.04 --> 7577.06
what do they call it age of paradox

7574.52 --> 7577.06
yeah

7577.34 --> 7585.56
there's two that's 2000 2016. not 15.

7582.92 --> 7588.38
but I call that the age of paradox

7585.56 --> 7591.92
or maybe I wrote in 2014 and then later

7588.38 --> 7594.5
unveiled it at 2016 when I found it back

7591.92 --> 7598.06
yeah I think that's how it went

7594.5 --> 7598.06
see if I have it somewhere

7598.76 --> 7602.8
Paradox where the hell is that thing

7604.94 --> 7608.799999999999
where did I even store that

7614.79 --> 7618.0
[Music]

7621.139 --> 7624.099
hmm

7625.52 --> 7628.179
pump

7630.92 --> 7634.42
where is it today

7635.0 --> 7639.58
where the [ __ ] did I store that [ __ ]

7639.679 --> 7643.639
it's on a sticky somewhere I'm pretty

7641.9 --> 7646.48
sure but it should be in my computer

7643.639 --> 7646.4800000000005
somewhere too

7647.619 --> 7651.098999999999
yeah here it is

7655.099 --> 7658.42
damn yeah it's pretty big

7659.06 --> 7663.639
it's a seven page book

7664.159 --> 7668.96
oh wait no this is the game

7666.619 --> 7671.78
holy [ __ ]

7668.96 --> 7675.8
that's right I forgot I made it into

7671.78 --> 7676.94
sort of a game first a time travel based

7675.8 --> 7679.219
game

7676.94 --> 7682.36
a time travel based role-playing game

7679.219 --> 7682.36
now I remember

7683.599 --> 7686.32
huh

7691.76 --> 7697.179
wow the order of the pre-eclecticum

7697.28 --> 7704.54
laws of the provisionary

7700.58 --> 7704.54
the D foundationists

7705.5 --> 7707.619
um

7709.599 --> 7717.860000000001
holy [ __ ] this stuff is cool so just

7713.239 --> 7717.86
looking back at it says Whoa damn

7718.159 --> 7720.82
ah

7733.88 --> 7738.28
shall I read like the uh

7739.659 --> 7745.28
shall I read the first page again of the

7743.659 --> 7746.48
age of paradox

7745.28 --> 7750.28
guys

7746.48 --> 7750.28
would you find that entertaining

7756.199 --> 7760.82
I don't know how well this is written it

7758.42 --> 7762.9800000000005
could be written better it's not it's

7760.82 --> 7765.5599999999995
not reading material it's like a game

7762.98 --> 7768.638999999999
description but

7765.56 --> 7768.639
uh we'll see

7770.119 --> 7778.0
if you're interested in me reading it

7774.139 --> 7778.0
type 1 in chat

7784.84 --> 7791.119000000001
if you don't care

7788.119 --> 7791.119
zero

7803.9 --> 7806.9
okay

7812.96 --> 7819.099
cool all right

7815.9 --> 7819.098999999999
so this is

7819.679 --> 7826.06
it is very well the the name d

7823.48 --> 7828.98
foundationists already

7826.06 --> 7832.76
reveals like sort of what this is based

7828.98 --> 7835.699
on in a way right the foundation

7832.76 --> 7838.280000000001
wasn't again as a famous science fiction

7835.699 --> 7841.78
book very technobabble

7838.28 --> 7841.78
who was the writer again

7843.26 --> 7847.4800000000005
forget the name let me look that up

7847.67 --> 7850.77
[Music]

7852.88 --> 7858.679
Foundation series was by

7858.739 --> 7863.138999999999
for [ __ ] sake why did it just say the

7860.9 --> 7863.138999999999
name

7866.719 --> 7872.199
ah I yeah Isaac Asimov yeah yeah Asimov

7872.9 --> 7878.739
right so it is it is kind of inspired on

7876.139 --> 7878.7390000000005
Asimov

7880.82 --> 7886.58
a little because of the technobab and

7883.28 --> 7889.219
because of how short it is right anyway

7886.58 --> 7890.719
this is not going to be Asimov quality

7889.219 --> 7892.58
okay this is like one of the first

7890.719 --> 7894.92
attempts at actually writing something

7892.58 --> 7897.98
science fiction oriented like the first

7894.92 --> 7900.02
time ever just like the first time I

7897.98 --> 7903.0199999999995
ever made a gold ring or a gold anything

7900.02 --> 7905.320000000001
it was this and it kind of like that's

7903.02 --> 7905.320000000001
it

7905.659 --> 7910.46
anyway

7907.639 --> 7913.659000000001
so yeah age of paradox role-playing game

7910.46 --> 7913.659
based on time travel

7914.26 --> 7921.58
keywords order of the pre-eclecticum

7918.32 --> 7925.28
the foundationists

7921.58 --> 7927.739
provisionary and the pre-clect

7925.28 --> 7929.739
right intro

7927.739 --> 7932.919999999999
in the near future

7929.739 --> 7936.32
paradoxic elements arrive rapidly

7932.92 --> 7939.619
destabilizing human culture distribution

7936.32 --> 7943.0
of wealth and even the stability of land

7939.619 --> 7947.0
itself an Ancient Order called the

7943.0 --> 7949.699
preclecticum moves out of the shadows in

7947.0 --> 7952.88
the final age and reveals that they are

7949.699 --> 7955.4
the guardians of time itself existing

7952.88 --> 7958.28
since the earliest beginnings of mankind

7955.4 --> 7960.379999999999
to prevent the destruction of the world

7958.28 --> 7963.32
that's intro

7960.38 --> 7966.139
here's the order of the preclectica all

7963.32 --> 7968.84
precollecticum agents are taught that in

7966.139 --> 7972.02
the ancient past a person of great

7968.84 --> 7975.38
wisdom named a pre-visionary

7972.02 --> 7977.599
by the preclecticon foresaw the age of

7975.38 --> 7980.36
paradox where time travel would

7977.599 --> 7983.4800000000005
inevitably be invented and the world

7980.36 --> 7986.179
destroyed because of it to prevent this

7983.48 --> 7989.239
he created the order of the proclecticum

7986.179 --> 7992.2390000000005
this order would guard the true history

7989.239 --> 7994.94
of things as they occurred and hide this

7992.239 --> 7997.4
knowledge from political influences and

7994.94 --> 7999.86
tyrannical rulers that would seek to

7997.4 --> 8002.44
erase the true history and bend it to

7999.86 --> 8005.799999999999
their own agenda why would the history

8002.44 --> 8008.44
be so significant because it was

8005.8 --> 8011.38
required to determine where and when

8008.44 --> 8016.36
time travelers would meddle with the

8011.38 --> 8019.719
timeline and in thus

8016.36 --> 8022.96
and in thus spawn the beginnings of what

8019.719 --> 8025.36
would eventually create World destroying

8022.96 --> 8027.94
paradoxes

8025.36 --> 8029.98
that's order of the proclectica now

8027.94 --> 8031.78
here's the pre-clect and the laws of the

8029.98 --> 8033.699
provisionary

8031.78 --> 8035.679
should I write that the foundation is

8033.699 --> 8037.36
first

8035.679 --> 8039.88
now I'll go with the pre-clicked and

8037.36 --> 8041.619
loss of provisionary right

8039.88 --> 8044.7390000000005
the pre-clect and the laws of the

8041.619 --> 8047.079
provisionary the knowledge and wisdom of

8044.739 --> 8050.799999999999
the pre-clecticum would be written down

8047.079 --> 8052.0599999999995
in the most sacred and secret book The

8050.8 --> 8055.119000000001
pre-clect

8052.06 --> 8057.88
a book would contain passages of the

8055.119 --> 8060.699
most significant event events that would

8057.88 --> 8062.86
shape Mankind's history in a way that

8060.699 --> 8066.28
would lower

8062.86 --> 8069.098999999999
nowhere to remove ah lower to remove the

8066.28 --> 8073.119
chances of paradoxes occurring but the

8069.099 --> 8074.32
book on its own would only be a

8073.119 --> 8077.38
guideline

8074.32 --> 8080.259999999999
the perklectica must follow the laws of

8077.38 --> 8082.78
the provisionary written down in the

8080.26 --> 8086.92
book of the pre-clect

8082.78 --> 8090.579
one the order must survive at all cost a

8086.92 --> 8093.04
significant element of this is that time

8090.579 --> 8095.86
travel may not be prevented from coming

8093.04 --> 8099.099
into existence

8095.86 --> 8101.98
two the order must send back agents to

8099.099 --> 8105.099
the Past once paradoxes are discovered

8101.98 --> 8108.459999999999
and meet up with their colleagues from

8105.099 --> 8111.76
the past to find the moment where the

8108.46 --> 8113.8
interferers would enter the past and

8111.76 --> 8115.360000000001
stop their influence from changing

8113.8 --> 8119.38
history

8115.36 --> 8122.199
three the eclecticum agents

8119.38 --> 8124.4800000000005
of the future may not share any

8122.199 --> 8126.82
foreknowledge of the future with their

8124.48 --> 8129.159
past agents due to the risk of changing

8126.82 --> 8131.799999999999
future themselves the only things they

8129.159 --> 8133.659
may share are what has been written down

8131.8 --> 8135.6990000000005
in the pre-clect

8133.659 --> 8139.0
the preclecticum

8135.699 --> 8142.598999999999
has their own special paradox

8139.0 --> 8145.42
that cannot be prevented because they

8142.599 --> 8148.179
must survive at all costs they will be

8145.42 --> 8149.56
at times be forced to use knowledge of

8148.179 --> 8152.26
the future to guarantee their own

8149.56 --> 8155.34
Survival this process is extremely risky

8152.26 --> 8158.7390000000005
must be engaged in with Extreme Caution

8155.34 --> 8162.639
5. the eclecticum agents that break the

8158.739 --> 8165.759999999999
code must be prevented from doing so and

8162.639 --> 8168.400000000001
when purposefully gone Rogue hunted down

8165.76 --> 8171.76
and destroyed and if not possible

8168.4 --> 8173.86
prevent it from ever being born

8171.76 --> 8176.860000000001
the pre-clect

8173.86 --> 8180.098999999999
s that pre-clicked nor time travel

8176.86 --> 8183.098999999999
technology may fall into the hands of

8180.099 --> 8183.099
non-preklecticum

8184.659 --> 8189.879999999999
all right

8187.119 --> 8191.739
so that's the preclectica

8189.88 --> 8195.82
that's their rules

8191.739 --> 8198.88
so here are the D foundationists

8195.82 --> 8201.519
the foundationists as agents of the

8198.88 --> 8204.098999999998
proclecticum is dealing with solving

8201.519 --> 8207.179
time paradoxes they are confronted with

8204.099 --> 8210.639000000001
agents of a disturbing opposing faction

8207.179 --> 8212.38
naming themselves the defoundationists

8210.639 --> 8215.858999999999
these radical

8212.38 --> 8217.899
radicals interfere with actions of the

8215.859 --> 8220.960000000001
proclecticum to prevent them from

8217.899 --> 8223.96
preventing paradoxes because they

8220.96 --> 8226.24
believe that only the only reason that

8223.96 --> 8228.699999999999
time paradoxes are happening is because

8226.24 --> 8230.92
of the order of the proclecticum and the

8228.7 --> 8233.019
Book of the preclect they believe that

8230.92 --> 8235.479
the provisionary was not actually a

8233.019 --> 8238.0
prophet but the first time traveler

8235.479 --> 8241.059
attempting to gain control over time

8238.0 --> 8242.859
itself and the Book of the pre-clect is

8241.059 --> 8245.858999999999
the source of his power

8242.859 --> 8249.54
the main goal is to get their hands on

8245.859 --> 8249.54
the pre-clect and destroy it

8254.559 --> 8257.559
cockatiel

8272.099 --> 8275.519
what do you think

8276.399 --> 8281.439
but the rest is just it's like what

8279.04 --> 8283.960000000001
would a typical age of paradox campaign

8281.439 --> 8285.460000000001
be like it's like oh this is if you

8283.96 --> 8287.018999999998
actually want to play a role-playing

8285.46 --> 8289.139
game with it that's what this was meant

8287.019 --> 8289.139000000001
for

8290.08 --> 8298.599
oh here's another part the views

8294.88 --> 8300.839999999998
here's the the proclecticum view of the

8298.599 --> 8300.84
world

8302.979 --> 8306.358999999999
didn't realize I wrote that yeah how I

8305.32 --> 8310.019
wrote that

8306.359 --> 8310.019
Evie that's right

8320.139 --> 8324.16
you could

8321.519 --> 8326.439
vase a whole science fiction fantasy

8324.16 --> 8328.059
epic around yeah you could make a

8326.439 --> 8329.800000000001
freaking television series out of this

8328.059 --> 8331.899
is it if it hasn't already been done

8329.8 --> 8334.92
technically because there's so many

8331.899 --> 8334.92
things like that

8335.859 --> 8341.34
all right

8337.0 --> 8341.34
I mean this is basically like time cop

8344.32 --> 8350.679
but what I spent on was mostly like the

8348.04 --> 8353.62
structure of this reality right the

8350.679 --> 8356.859
reality of how the time works the time

8353.62 --> 8359.439
paradoxes it's like it's a universe what

8356.859 --> 8362.5
I what I just wrote out is literally a

8359.439 --> 8365.32
cosmology complete set

8362.5 --> 8368.38
it's a world a world in which time

8365.32 --> 8371.76
travel is and really thought through to

8368.38 --> 8371.759999999998
the to the to the end

8372.399 --> 8375.0
right

8375.519 --> 8378.719000000001
so let me continue

8380.439 --> 8386.74
with the World Views because that is

8382.66 --> 8389.08
very wow damn it I wrote a lot of things

8386.74 --> 8393.42
like yeah I got

8389.08 --> 8393.42
seven pages but man

8394.72 --> 8397.74
so here's the

8397.859 --> 8402.7
pre-eclecticum view of the world yeah

8400.78 --> 8406.060000000001
it's complete culture

8402.7 --> 8409.6
that's what it is this is a universe

8406.06 --> 8412.06
okay the order of the preclecticon all

8409.6 --> 8414.52
precollecticum agents are taught the

8412.06 --> 8417.22
same Legend the proclecticum is centered

8414.52 --> 8419.140000000001
around one person of great wisdom named

8417.22 --> 8422.019999999999
the provisionary the provisionary saw

8419.14 --> 8424.42
through all time and souls

8422.02 --> 8429.460000000001
how wait

8424.42 --> 8431.979
yeah so through all time and souls

8429.46 --> 8434.38
how the structure of the universe was

8431.979 --> 8438.279999999999
formed and with this foreknowledge he

8434.38 --> 8440.74
lifted out the key points and wrote it

8438.28 --> 8443.439
in his book The pre-clect

8440.74 --> 8445.859
this is literally a Visionary the

8443.439 --> 8450.16
pre-clect contains all key events

8445.859 --> 8452.62
throughout the ages up to its up from

8450.16 --> 8454.38
its creation until the inevitable age of

8452.62 --> 8456.939
paradox where time travel would

8454.38 --> 8458.38
inadvertently be invented through the

8456.939 --> 8461.02
technium

8458.38 --> 8464.74
and through sorcery

8461.02 --> 8467.140000000001
upon the arrival of time travel the

8464.74 --> 8469.66
world would be destroyed by paradoxes

8467.14 --> 8471.939
that unfolded soon after the

8469.66 --> 8474.039999999999
provisionary gave the pre-clect a clear

8471.939 --> 8477.1
Mission throughout the ages

8474.04 --> 8479.979000000001
it alone would be the Guardians

8477.1 --> 8481.54
on the pre-clacked and the true history

8479.979 --> 8484.358999999999
of things

8481.54 --> 8486.460000000001
each new generation would swear to have

8484.359 --> 8489.24
their pre-eclectic and Heritage remain

8486.46 --> 8493.14
hidden from folklore and history books

8489.24 --> 8495.399
secrecy is key because

8493.14 --> 8498.399
political influence and tyrannical

8495.399 --> 8500.68
rulers would always seek to erase the

8498.399 --> 8503.019999999999
true history and bend it to their own

8500.68 --> 8505.720000000001
agenda thus risking the mission of the

8503.02 --> 8507.76
proclecticum to invent time travel and

8505.72 --> 8509.5
prevent the age of paradox within the

8507.76 --> 8512.26
past

8509.5 --> 8515.02
the D foundationists

8512.26 --> 8517.479
the pre-eclecticum Swarm Rivals would

8515.02 --> 8520.6
search the history books and use time

8517.479 --> 8522.88
travel of their own to seek the

8520.6 --> 8526.18
pre-clects out and Destroy them as

8522.88 --> 8529.179999999998
pre-foundation is do there there is a

8526.18 --> 8531.220000000001
forbidden prophecy that one day the

8529.18 --> 8533.859
final D foundationist

8531.22 --> 8536.519999999999
would come to end the order of the

8533.859 --> 8536.52
proclectica

8540.58 --> 8545.319
right and then there's like what are the

8543.1 --> 8547.479000000001
members of the order of the proclecticon

8545.319 --> 8549.939
typically like

8547.479 --> 8552.938999999998
free collect individuals throughout the

8549.939 --> 8555.359
ages pre-clect during the age of the

8552.939 --> 8557.56
paradox

8555.359 --> 8559.54
pre-eclectic and view of the foundation

8557.56 --> 8561.699999999999
is throughout the ages for eclectic and

8559.54 --> 8564.160000000002
view of the on the foundation is during

8561.7 --> 8566.34
the age of paradox

8564.16 --> 8570.46
and then there's the defoundationist

8566.34 --> 8573.7
Rebellion view of the world

8570.46 --> 8575.199999999999
and then there few

8573.7 --> 8577.54
the foundation is from the age of

8575.2 --> 8579.460000000001
paradox the great revelation of the

8577.54 --> 8582.04
pre-eclecticum

8579.46 --> 8584.619999999999
those that witness the end

8582.04 --> 8587.2
the foundation is Time Travelers the

8584.62 --> 8590.399000000001
foundation is Cults the found the final

8587.2 --> 8590.399000000001
the foundationist

8594.78 --> 8600.28
foreign

8597.3 --> 8606.358999999999
and the technium

8600.28 --> 8606.359
the order of time Refuge the Dema trucks

8609.06 --> 8614.14
the ruthless Mages of the spinning

8612.7 --> 8617.5
spheres

8614.14 --> 8619.42
Disciples of the Holy flame those are

8617.5 --> 8622.42
other

8619.42 --> 8622.42
influences

8626.859 --> 8632.26
I should freaking I should just [ __ ]

8629.439 --> 8634.359
publish this just like this I mean yeah

8632.26 --> 8636.16
seven pitch who gives a [ __ ] man read

8634.359 --> 8639.12
this [ __ ] and you'll like have things

8636.16 --> 8639.119999999999
running in your head

8642.04 --> 8645.04
foreign

8669.72 --> 8675.64
Disciples of the Holy you want to know

8671.92 --> 8678.88
what that is okay let me read it out

8675.64 --> 8681.64
Disciples of the Holy flame an Ancient

8678.88 --> 8684.46
Order of Mages that has mastered magic

8681.64 --> 8685.539999999999
and time travel long before mankind was

8684.46 --> 8688.539999999999
created

8685.54 --> 8690.7
they sent forth their tentacled

8688.54 --> 8694.6
monstrosities

8690.7 --> 8697.66
Through Time physically and then possess

8694.6 --> 8698.859
them from within at the gate in the

8697.66 --> 8701.38
heavens

8698.859 --> 8704.5
at a point these bizarre creatures

8701.38 --> 8706.539999999999
managed to find their way into that into

8704.5 --> 8709.68
time periods where time travel is

8706.54 --> 8713.26
rampant on a very rare occasion

8709.68 --> 8715.78
Disciples of the Holy flame descend upon

8713.26 --> 8718.359
the Earth in person their appearance is

8715.78 --> 8722.380000000001
so profound and impressive that all that

8718.359 --> 8725.439
gaze upon them go in a forgetful but

8722.38 --> 8728.099999999999
Pleasant dream state

8725.439 --> 8728.1
foreign

8733.0 --> 8737.04
it's not exactly what you're thinking

8734.8 --> 8737.039999999999
right

8745.66 --> 8749.88
wanna hear what the dayma trucks is

8758.319 --> 8766.119999999999
all right the demo trucks is a bizarre

8761.979 --> 8769.479
occurrence lost in Paradox before the

8766.12 --> 8773.26
age of paradox the technium created by

8769.479 --> 8776.019999999999
Solon Left Behind many traces thanks to

8773.26 --> 8777.399
solon's Relentless time traveling ways I

8776.02 --> 8778.899000000001
should actually read that out first

8777.399 --> 8783.0
because it's

8778.899 --> 8783.0
oh I'll leave that later wait

8783.1 --> 8787.84
no I should definitely read that first

8785.08 --> 8789.52
because it's like okay here it goes so

8787.84 --> 8790.72
long and a technium you need to know

8789.52 --> 8794.560000000001
that first

8790.72 --> 8798.699999999999
Solon was the one of the most powerful

8794.56 --> 8802.359
of pre-clects that was both Master of

8798.7 --> 8806.92
the circle and inventor of the technium

8802.359 --> 8809.859
his power and wickedness were unmatched

8806.92 --> 8812.92
as he seated his Spirit upon a machine

8809.859 --> 8815.26
of his own creation that he would send

8812.92 --> 8817.960000000001
back in time physically

8815.26 --> 8820.6
so long discovered that it does not

8817.96 --> 8824.858999999999
matter how much you change the timeline

8820.6 --> 8827.380000000001
by leaving behind traces as long as you

8824.859 --> 8829.42
spread enough fear everyone will forget

8827.38 --> 8830.74
about it and erase it from their

8829.42 --> 8834.7
memories

8830.74 --> 8838.42
fear must be stronger than curiosity

8834.7 --> 8842.26
this is one of his most infinite sayings

8838.42 --> 8844.42
Solon stayed seemingly forever as the

8842.26 --> 8846.7
last elements of the world

8844.42 --> 8849.84
has all had this

8846.7 --> 8853.439
what this interferrating

8849.84 --> 8853.439
disintegrating what the hell

8854.02 --> 8859.0
integrating around him leaving behind

8856.479 --> 8862.3
only a blinding white light hungrily

8859.0 --> 8865.479
closing in around him the space he had

8862.3 --> 8868.0
left his laboratory was protected by a

8865.479 --> 8870.819
powerful energy field created by the

8868.0 --> 8874.12
endless smarts of the technium keeping

8870.819 --> 8876.46
the paradoxes out as so long kept

8874.12 --> 8879.28
sending forth his drone monstrosities

8876.46 --> 8882.16
back in time

8879.28 --> 8885.880000000001
so that's so long and the technium it's

8882.16 --> 8889.18
literally somebody who somehow managed

8885.88 --> 8891.16
to survive as the Paradox already

8889.18 --> 8894.28
destroy reality

8891.16 --> 8896.74
so it's like found a way to basically

8894.28 --> 8899.140000000001
halt himself from being destroyed even

8896.74 --> 8901.42
as reality is disintegrating around him

8899.14 --> 8904.24
through paradox

8901.42 --> 8907.439
pretty heavy right so that's so London

8904.24 --> 8911.439
attacked him so here's the demo trucks

8907.439 --> 8914.319
is a bizarre occurrence lost in Paradox

8911.439 --> 8916.960000000001
before the age of paradox the technium

8914.319 --> 8919.3
created by so long left behind many

8916.96 --> 8921.759999999998
traces thanks to solon's Relentless time

8919.3 --> 8924.46
traveling ways the machine without

8921.76 --> 8927.0
solon's control could not be animated

8924.46 --> 8931.479
but sometimes

8927.0 --> 8934.42
sometimes Travelers yeah

8931.479 --> 8936.64
sometimes Travelers Came Upon solon's

8934.42 --> 8939.52
creation and managed to use their

8936.64 --> 8943.24
telepathic and telekinetic powers to

8939.52 --> 8945.399000000001
animate them like puppets in the end

8943.24 --> 8948.1
when the universe is darkened until

8945.399 --> 8950.08
space itself has been erased and there

8948.1 --> 8954.1
is nothing but darkness and a flat plane

8950.08 --> 8956.56
of Cold Stone the techniums remnants had

8954.1 --> 8959.62
been reprogrammed

8956.56 --> 8962.439
had been reprogrammed their inner

8959.62 --> 8964.899000000001
curiosity either inner circuitry to

8962.439 --> 8968.859
animate themselves and using their power

8964.899 --> 8972.64
cores to summon Consciousness into the

8968.859 --> 8975.58
technium managed to emulate mind powers

8972.64 --> 8978.76
the technium's part throughout eternity

8975.58 --> 8981.64
dwell upon the endless flat plain

8978.76 --> 8985.06
at the full cycle it managed to gather

8981.64 --> 8987.46
itself and how big it became the

8985.06 --> 8991.119999999999
daematrucks the self-designed

8987.46 --> 8993.819
Consciousness machine immune to Paradox

8991.12 --> 8996.04
it dwells in the darkness for all

8993.819 --> 9000.439
eternity Meeting those that have

8996.04 --> 9000.439
ascended into immunity to paradox

9001.74 --> 9005.18
are you still following

9027.54 --> 9032.0
I'll take the silence in chat as a no

9033.96 --> 9036.56
foreign

9060.37 --> 9065.239000000001
[Music]

9068.44 --> 9075.2
[Music]

9083.359 --> 9087.08
everybody else is doing

9105.5 --> 9110.22
that was really good

9108.18 --> 9112.439
I want to hear about nebular they're

9110.22 --> 9114.66
ruthless

9112.439 --> 9116.58
and yes every single example of these

9114.66 --> 9119.22
are total mind [ __ ] every single one

9116.58 --> 9121.319
just so you're sitting for your record

9119.22 --> 9124.319
for the record

9121.319 --> 9127.5
right so nebular the ruthless

9124.319 --> 9129.42
or nebular the horit was the first of

9127.5 --> 9132.899
the pre-clect time travelers that

9129.42 --> 9135.72
ruthlessly decided to

9132.899 --> 9138.84
time himself in

9135.72 --> 9140.938999999998
with as many possible key moments of the

9138.84 --> 9143.58
proclectic and critical moments in the

9140.939 --> 9145.14
occulted history attempting to reinsure

9143.58 --> 9147.78
his own existence

9145.14 --> 9150.66
but unfortunately he would find out that

9147.78 --> 9154.2
his actions got more backlash the

9150.66 --> 9156.72
closure the age of paradox arrived thus

9154.2 --> 9159.78
the nebular

9156.72 --> 9161.938999999998
thus navalar only left his mark on the

9159.78 --> 9164.640000000001
most ancient period

9161.939 --> 9166.92
which two current day would be the

9164.64 --> 9169.619999999999
considered ancient ruins

9166.92 --> 9171.0
his incredible knowledge and magic of

9169.62 --> 9175.68
magic

9171.0 --> 9178.08
and design left a special mark on his

9175.68 --> 9180.24
designing wait this might not be

9178.08 --> 9183.3
perfectly edited

9180.24 --> 9186.3
perfectly carved Stone of incredible

9183.3 --> 9188.819
sizes it was easy

9186.3 --> 9191.46
for the mighty Naval era that was

9188.819 --> 9194.039999999999
worshiped like a god in the time where

9191.46 --> 9196.8
he ruled all openly and kept the

9194.04 --> 9198.960000000001
pre-clect hidden from the public nebular

9196.8 --> 9201.66
never saw the paradox

9198.96 --> 9205.38
as he was among the first to time travel

9201.66 --> 9207.899
back in time his ambition overtook him

9205.38 --> 9210.839999999998
once he realized he could rule his

9207.899 --> 9213.24
chosen era he never time traveled back

9210.84 --> 9216.66
to the future again and died of natural

9213.24 --> 9219.72
causes ending up in a giant carved out

9216.66 --> 9222.0
tomb in a mountainous desert guarded by

9219.72 --> 9224.76
an ancient Cult of Ruthless Nomad

9222.0 --> 9228.3
Hunters sworn to protect his corpse

9224.76 --> 9230.880000000001
from the Devil eventually in the age of

9228.3 --> 9234.358999999999
paradox some managed to find the Ancient

9230.88 --> 9237.479
Temple of nebilar and use his body parts

9234.359 --> 9240.0
in Magic rituals that would allow

9237.479 --> 9242.539999999999
spiritual time travel to those not

9240.0 --> 9242.54
trained

9264.54 --> 9271.7
oh Loose Ends yeah metal slugs what do

9268.62 --> 9271.7
you think is keeping it together

9273.899 --> 9281.519999999999
what what you need some

9276.78 --> 9282.42
some midichlorians to explain why no no

9281.52 --> 9286.979000000001
no

9282.42 --> 9288.84
no it's just yeah you just use magic as

9286.979 --> 9291.72
in powers

9288.84 --> 9294.72
time travel through powers

9291.72 --> 9296.039999999999
in word travel spiritual time travel

9294.72 --> 9298.319
right

9296.04 --> 9301.28
to connect with other time through the

9298.319 --> 9301.279999999999
Timeless dimension

9301.56 --> 9304.699999999999
and then manifest

9312.479 --> 9317.46
if I'd had to explain every single

9315.78 --> 9321.439
mechanic

9317.46 --> 9321.438999999998
you think it'd still be interesting

9323.939 --> 9330.54
no the whole point of it is it's all

9327.84 --> 9333.54
very rapid paced suspense of disbelief

9330.54 --> 9335.7
that's the entire point of it that's the

9333.54 --> 9337.140000000001
entire point of high heavy science

9335.7 --> 9339.6
fiction

9337.14 --> 9341.399
is the entire point of the foundation

9339.6 --> 9344.52
series

9341.399 --> 9346.619999999999
how that was is exactly that it's all

9344.52 --> 9348.42
just this that this that this that just

9346.62 --> 9351.060000000001
you gotta go with everything you just

9348.42 --> 9352.58
you don't try to freaking explain the

9351.06 --> 9356.539999999999
details

9352.58 --> 9356.539999999999
they'll lose the effects

9360.42 --> 9364.5
I'm not saying you have to explain all

9362.399 --> 9367.439
of it yeah but once you start

9364.5 --> 9369.42
then you would you would have to it's

9367.439 --> 9372.66
like yeah but

9369.42 --> 9375.899
but how does the vacuum

9372.66 --> 9378.66
how does the air stay in the cockpits of

9375.899 --> 9381.479
the Thai fighters when it's just a

9378.66 --> 9384.539999999999
little square with thin glass like yeah

9381.479 --> 9386.46
yeah yeah that's why we don't try to

9384.54 --> 9388.439
explain that

9386.46 --> 9389.88
yeah

9388.439 --> 9393.800000000001
it's very simple

9389.88 --> 9393.8
you don't address it

9394.74 --> 9401.76
asking questions it's a movie

9398.52 --> 9404.959
okay that's the trick

9401.76 --> 9404.959
[Music]

9409.26 --> 9413.54
choose a Wiki that's hilarious

9414.12 --> 9419.84
all right

9416.64 --> 9419.84
[Music]

9449.1 --> 9453.439
anyway I hope you enjoyed that

9453.6 --> 9456.979000000001
it's pretty cool to find it back

9462.54 --> 9468.5
put the book on my book it's just a text

9466.02 --> 9468.5
file

9502.319 --> 9505.319
foreign

9510.68 --> 9516.0
publishing whatever the

9513.54 --> 9518.34
we'll see about that I mean it's just

9516.0 --> 9521.96
seven pages and as you said there's no

9518.34 --> 9521.960000000001
real coherence it's just

9522.06 --> 9527.399
it's just like a quick doodle right it's

9524.88 --> 9529.259999999998
a it's a science fiction writing doodle

9527.399 --> 9530.819
that's what it is she goes oh I'm

9529.26 --> 9533.880000000001
thinking about some time travel stuff

9530.819 --> 9535.319
let's overdo this [ __ ] and that's what

9533.88 --> 9538.08
came out

9535.319 --> 9540.979
the total time I spent on writing that

9538.08 --> 9540.979
is like a month

9545.34 --> 9548.54
[Music]

9552.24 --> 9558.66
I do rich you know okay okay maybe I'll

9556.439 --> 9561.62
think about it we'll see

9558.66 --> 9561.619999999999
we'll see

9580.62 --> 9587.899000000001
oh there's the ball busters live to this

9583.08 --> 9587.899
evening by the way just so you guys know

9589.08 --> 9592.22
it's Saturday of course

9592.38 --> 9597.48
and ball busters is live once again this

9596.04 --> 9600.53
evening and I will be on it

9597.48 --> 9600.529999999999
[Music]

9619.26 --> 9628.28
okay love fruit dude just contact me

9622.979 --> 9628.279999999999
like on Skype and we'll talk about it

9634.2 --> 9639.6
is that good I mean the thing needs to

9637.26 --> 9641.76
be like proof read first

9639.6 --> 9644.300000000001
I mean there's spelling errors in that

9641.76 --> 9644.300000000001
thing still

9648.24 --> 9653.88
also don't expect it to be complete it's

9651.78 --> 9655.800000000001
it's not complete it's not even supposed

9653.88 --> 9658.858999999999
to be complete

9655.8 --> 9662.938999999998
okay we'll do at some good love I really

9658.859 --> 9665.1
want you as contact for multiple reasons

9662.939 --> 9667.26
because I I also want to be able to

9665.1 --> 9671.24
probably ask you some tips about

9667.26 --> 9671.24
programming when I get to that stage

9675.18 --> 9678.74
I'm gonna need a lot of help

9685.56 --> 9689.939
thank you I'm great when I'm positive

9688.08 --> 9691.859
and a bit yeah I think so too metal

9689.939 --> 9696.02
slugs got a deal it's like

9691.859 --> 9696.02
sometimes I just can't prevent myself

9696.979 --> 9702.479
I just can't sometimes it just it's like

9700.08 --> 9705.479
sometimes the dog just goes barking you

9702.479 --> 9707.039999999999
know I just can't stop it

9705.479 --> 9708.24
but

9707.04 --> 9710.04
well

9708.24 --> 9712.38
when it's just everything comes together

9710.04 --> 9714.359
there's good things there's especially

9712.38 --> 9718.319
purpose since I got into this boulder

9714.359 --> 9721.5
dash I really feel so much stronger

9718.319 --> 9723.72
I really feel very strong like because I

9721.5 --> 9726.54
got a mission right

9723.72 --> 9730.199999999999
before this my only real mission is like

9726.54 --> 9731.640000000001
you gotta do the show every day

9730.2 --> 9733.68
but

9731.64 --> 9738.539999999999
yeah what do I do in the evening then

9733.68 --> 9740.819
right except watch other shows

9738.54 --> 9743.819000000001
well now I have this creative project

9740.819 --> 9745.5
and it's like a huge solution for me

9743.819 --> 9748.08
it's like oh suddenly all these chains

9745.5 --> 9749.819
are coming off because there's like more

9748.08 --> 9752.22
complicated things that I can now

9749.819 --> 9754.199999999999
continually do

9752.22 --> 9758.099999999999
that will actually amount to something

9754.2 --> 9762.12
and not just yay you won the level again

9758.1 --> 9766.640000000001
you know because that gaming is fun and

9762.12 --> 9766.640000000001
all but sometimes it just sucks

9768.67 --> 9773.22
[Music]

9769.979 --> 9775.56
and I'm already a dude I'm

9773.22 --> 9777.92
there's crazy things gonna happen in

9775.56 --> 9777.92
this game

9778.74 --> 9783.96
I'm actually considering now multiple

9781.68 --> 9786.479000000001
gases

9783.96 --> 9789.5
right there was a vacuum option in the

9786.479 --> 9793.679999999998
Bulova Dash game I'm actually

9789.5 --> 9795.3
considering having hydrogen gas

9793.68 --> 9798.06
and by the way that you could

9795.3 --> 9800.3
technically create using electrodes in

9798.06 --> 9800.3
water

9800.46 --> 9805.08
so that it's a complete chemistry

9803.0 --> 9807.24
session and you can have like

9805.08 --> 9809.88
electrolysis

9807.24 --> 9812.46
because why not

9809.88 --> 9814.5
but yeah I'm considering making a system

9812.46 --> 9816.779999999999
where they're beside there being air and

9814.5 --> 9820.319
vacuum you could also have

9816.78 --> 9822.720000000001
well effectively explosive gas that you

9820.319 --> 9824.22
wouldn't be able to see but if it can be

9822.72 --> 9826.819
triggered and then it will literally

9824.22 --> 9826.819
explode

9828.84 --> 9833.3
so that just never stops

9833.46 --> 9839.039999999999
freaking ideas really just never stop

9835.859 --> 9842.0
just more and more and more and more and

9839.04 --> 9842.0
just like oh my God

9845.1 --> 9850.979000000001
right but even if I wouldn't do that I

9848.1 --> 9853.800000000001
already got so much

9850.979 --> 9855.8
it's incredible

9853.8 --> 9859.979
walls

9855.8 --> 9863.64
Boulders in air in vacuum

9859.979 --> 9867.479
in water in ice

9863.64 --> 9869.16
in lava in acid

9867.479 --> 9871.619999999999
yeah

9869.16 --> 9873.119999999999
but I'm also like I'm noticing that I am

9871.62 --> 9875.460000000001
trying to make up new things because

9873.12 --> 9877.68
there's a really tedious part that I

9875.46 --> 9879.839999999998
actually should be getting to now

9877.68 --> 9882.6
and that is the total check routines

9879.84 --> 9884.7
like literally the commands as to what

9882.6 --> 9888.6
to do but I've been like heavily

9884.7 --> 9890.7
organizing the the command words the the

9888.6 --> 9893.7
action words

9890.7 --> 9898.220000000001
as to make it all much smoother and

9893.7 --> 9898.220000000001
logical and easy to oversee

9899.64 --> 9904.019999999999
because the setting work and like how

9902.34 --> 9905.52
does this work how does this respond to

9904.02 --> 9907.859
that how does that respond to that

9905.52 --> 9910.319000000001
that's pretty much been not pretty much

9907.859 --> 9912.66
it's completely hundred percent iron out

9910.319 --> 9915.899
I got it complete I know how everything

9912.66 --> 9917.76
reacts to everything I know I know how

9915.899 --> 9920.279999999999
it all works

9917.76 --> 9923.22
I just gotta like

9920.28 --> 9926.28
create the checks

9923.22 --> 9929.22
and that can be pretty big ass blocks of

9926.28 --> 9932.28
text too which is really tedious and

9929.22 --> 9933.358999999999
very easy to to get to make a mistake in

9932.28 --> 9936.479000000001
that

9933.359 --> 9939.11
so I'm like it's a bit of an

9936.479 --> 9942.188999999998
organization challenge at this point

9939.11 --> 9942.189
[Music]

9951.54 --> 9954.899000000001
anyway thanks for being there this metal

10031.64 --> 10036.74
space deserts The Knowing witch path

10034.16 --> 10038.539999999999
experiment and the age of paradox and it

10036.74 --> 10040.88
all fits too that's the most awesome

10038.54 --> 10044.300000000001
part sometimes it's really hard to fit

10040.88 --> 10047.858999999999
the title when there's multiple subjects

10044.3 --> 10047.858999999999
but it all fits perfectly

10048.2 --> 10051.34
character's despair

10060.5 --> 10064.0
what okay

10072.02 --> 10076.359
okay I don't know what you're talking

10073.64 --> 10076.358999999999
about love fruit

10079.819 --> 10086.08
project you're working on so are you a

10083.0 --> 10086.08
professional programmer

10086.66 --> 10091.119999999999
like are you actually doing that right

10088.939 --> 10091.12
now

10092.3 --> 10095.3
cool

10096.319 --> 10098.8
okay

10103.46 --> 10108.46
what are you using are you using like C

10105.92 --> 10108.460000000001
plus plus

10111.68 --> 10115.78
or some other

10113.24 --> 10115.78
thing

10124.899 --> 10132.699999999999
Maui see hashtag

10129.319 --> 10132.699999999999
what is C hashtag

10134.06 --> 10138.619999999999
see hashtag is that plus plus plus or

10137.0 --> 10144.819
something

10138.62 --> 10144.819000000001
e is four pluses C sharp okay

10146.899 --> 10151.72
why the hell is it called Maui that's so

10149.479 --> 10151.72
weird

10153.5 --> 10155.68
thank you

10174.76 --> 10181.960000000001
right okay whatever it's called I don't

10178.28 --> 10181.960000000001
know what it is are the works

10183.859 --> 10188.62
is it better

10185.84 --> 10192.939
is it easier

10188.62 --> 10192.939
multi-platform app okay

10198.92 --> 10202.78
net multi

10203.02 --> 10209.62
multi-app user interface sounds kind of

10206.72 --> 10212.979
stupid why isn't it called

10209.62 --> 10212.979000000001
nmp app

10215.54 --> 10224.84
like n m p a u e

10220.66 --> 10229.359
map pooey right

10224.84 --> 10229.359
they wanted it to be called Maui

10229.7 --> 10235.1
they wanted it so that makes it all

10232.16 --> 10238.1
really oh conspiracy why is it called

10235.1 --> 10242.02
Maui Maui just got torched by directed

10238.1 --> 10242.02
energy weapons in the New World Order

10242.62 --> 10248.84
why the [ __ ] would they call it Maui

10245.3 --> 10253.96
when it's not literally Maui except to

10248.84 --> 10253.960000000001
just create a giant weird confusion

10254.44 --> 10257.549
[Music]

10261.5 --> 10266.54
been about four years yeah makes it even

10264.68 --> 10271.24
more suspicious why the [ __ ] would it be

10266.54 --> 10271.240000000002
called Maui in the recent four years

10271.46 --> 10276.5
I mean if it would have been called Maui

10274.04 --> 10279.979000000001
say 20 years ago I'd be like yeah yeah

10276.5 --> 10282.38
why not you know oh good sure it's Maui

10279.979 --> 10285.199999999999
it's four years old and they call it

10282.38 --> 10286.938999999998
Maui when that's not even literally the

10285.2 --> 10288.560000000001
acronym

10286.939 --> 10290.2
that's just

10288.56 --> 10292.539999999999
I'm sorry

10290.2 --> 10296.54
that's weird

10292.54 --> 10299.300000000001
conspiracy devil foresight [ __ ]

10296.54 --> 10300.92
somebody [ __ ] told them to call it

10299.3 --> 10303.259999999998
Maui okay

10300.92 --> 10305.74
somebody [ __ ] told them to call it

10303.26 --> 10305.74
Maui

10306.979 --> 10314.06
you know they did

10309.88 --> 10319.16
why the [ __ ] else would you want to call

10314.06 --> 10322.58
it Maui when the acronym isn't even Maui

10319.16 --> 10325.16
it's like oh why did why did the the

10322.58 --> 10327.74
Vatican call their super telescope

10325.16 --> 10329.18
Lucifer well it just

10327.74 --> 10331.399
happens to

10329.18 --> 10334.64
me that it just couldn't help it it's

10331.399 --> 10336.68
not like it was like really blatantly on

10334.64 --> 10339.38
purpose

10336.68 --> 10343.1
yeah it was

10339.38 --> 10345.278999999999
Microsoft open source ah [ __ ] sake of

10343.1 --> 10345.279
course

10353.5 --> 10357.58
well that makes perfect sense

10357.62 --> 10364.1
right of course you want to name your

10360.68 --> 10366.939
open source stuff after places that have

10364.1 --> 10369.800000000001
been completely torched to the ground

10366.939 --> 10373.399
including Women and Children of course

10369.8 --> 10375.74
you want the open source software to be

10373.399 --> 10378.699999999999
referencing that

10375.74 --> 10378.699999999999
am I right

10379.16 --> 10384.439
just for the association oh you want to

10381.92 --> 10386.66
use the the free open source stuff

10384.439 --> 10389.899
that's okay

10386.66 --> 10392.42
but only if we give it a name that you

10389.899 --> 10397.24
will directly reference

10392.42 --> 10397.24
to like mass destruction and death

10397.88 --> 10401.358999999999
right

10399.02 --> 10403.819000000001
it's like calling your new programming

10401.359 --> 10404.62
your new programming open source

10403.819 --> 10407.72
language

10404.62 --> 10410.0
Stalingrad yeah this is Stalingrad the

10407.72 --> 10412.278999999999
new programming language it's

10410.0 --> 10415.64
it's not a reference to like biggest

10412.279 --> 10418.18
Slaughter in history or anything

10415.64 --> 10418.18
right

10420.02 --> 10425.42
or what else could you call it

10423.38 --> 10429.099999999999
give me another name

10425.42 --> 10429.1
that would be like oh

10429.319 --> 10432.46
what would be a good one

10437.54 --> 10440.800000000001
you know what I mean right

10445.24 --> 10450.399
before it

10447.62 --> 10450.399000000001
oh

10450.859 --> 10459.68
so they just change it to Maui

10455.6 --> 10463.359
just a few years ago it's not [ __ ]

10459.68 --> 10463.359
suspicious at all

10469.76 --> 10473.56
a flatter Sage could see you

10478.03 --> 10481.219000000001
[Music]

10493.04 --> 10499.04
okay

10494.2 --> 10502.04
Huey 2 Chain is Maui

10499.04 --> 10502.04
okay

10503.359 --> 10509.0
okay never mind it's just weird calling

10506.899 --> 10510.858999999999
like now it's weird

10509.0 --> 10515.02
but even then it would be we're like why

10510.859 --> 10515.02
the [ __ ] would you call it Maui why

10515.06 --> 10520.88
why was it called Maui why

10518.479 --> 10523.039999999999
and don't give me that acronym [ __ ]

10520.88 --> 10527.358999999999
because the acronym wasn't even Maui so

10523.04 --> 10530.359
why the [ __ ] would you call it Maui why

10527.359 --> 10534.34
give me the reason love fruit why the

10530.359 --> 10534.34
[ __ ] would they call it Maui

10535.359 --> 10541.960000000001
yeah you we I know user interface why

10539.06 --> 10541.96
Maui

10553.819 --> 10560.119999999999
and by the way the the more official is

10556.399 --> 10561.858999999999
gooey yeah graphic user interface

10560.12 --> 10564.819000000001
because user interface is always

10561.859 --> 10564.819
Graphics based

10573.279 --> 10578.54
explosive chemicals in the present in

10576.08 --> 10581.12
the waters I heard that too flutter said

10578.54 --> 10583.1
yeah I heard that too that was really

10581.12 --> 10585.319000000001
weird

10583.1 --> 10587.859
you're bad don't worry low fruit don't

10585.319 --> 10587.859
worry about it

10588.26 --> 10593.899
I mean I know you did it wasn't your

10591.26 --> 10596.0
programming interface thing right you

10593.899 --> 10598.099999999999
didn't call it that I'm not blaming you

10596.0 --> 10600.859
I've just like so what why the [ __ ]

10598.1 --> 10603.439
would you call it Maui

10600.859 --> 10605.6
it's like you're just doing that on

10603.439 --> 10608.06
purpose didn't you Bill Gates it's

10605.6 --> 10610.279
[ __ ] Bill Gates Again just like oh oh

10608.06 --> 10613.34
we're gonna yeah we're gonna torch this

10610.279 --> 10616.52
place gonna buy it up except for Obama's

10613.34 --> 10619.04
homes and my home and oh but they're

10616.52 --> 10622.1
gonna get torched so let's call our new

10619.04 --> 10624.26
programming language Maui

10622.1 --> 10626.960000000001
I mean that is just so [ __ ] Bill

10624.26 --> 10630.880000000001
Gates dude

10626.96 --> 10630.88
why else would you do that

10638.66 --> 10644.38
it's safe to drink

10641.779 --> 10644.380000000001
okay

10667.7 --> 10672.26
two chain for you bro

10672.68 --> 10677.800000000001
okay just for the record low fruit I am

10674.899 --> 10677.8
not a programmer

10677.899 --> 10682.64
to me it's all the same oh tool chain

10680.6 --> 10684.979000000001
it's a tool chain that one is the

10682.64 --> 10687.56
language yeah dude it's all freaking

10684.979 --> 10690.858999999999
programming language to me just because

10687.56 --> 10692.24
one is the thing within the programming

10690.859 --> 10694.939
language and the other is the language

10692.24 --> 10696.399
it's all the programming language to me

10694.939 --> 10701.25
okay

10696.399 --> 10708.559
you're all using it for programming

10701.25 --> 10708.559
[Music]

10708.7 --> 10713.319000000001
but it's okay it's cool it's cool

10717.5 --> 10721.16
it's not your bad it's not your dude

10719.479 --> 10723.858999999999
you're a programmer you're supposed to

10721.16 --> 10726.2
be correct programmers are supposed to

10723.859 --> 10729.319
be super nitpicky

10726.2 --> 10731.359
because yeah if you're not then you get

10729.319 --> 10734.0
an error and like one stupid little

10731.359 --> 10736.1
error could cost you like hours and

10734.0 --> 10738.62
hours of multiple employees trying to

10736.1 --> 10742.1
find the [ __ ] error so yeah you need

10738.62 --> 10745.1
to be detailed I get it thank you for

10742.1 --> 10747.02
the information about which is which is

10745.1 --> 10749.62
just that

10747.02 --> 10752.720000000001
it's all the same to me baby

10749.62 --> 10754.52
no not really I get it now one is the

10752.72 --> 10756.8
graphics interface

10754.52 --> 10758.68
tool

10756.8 --> 10761.479
so it's like the intermediary

10758.68 --> 10763.7
intermediary unit specifically for

10761.479 --> 10766.22
interface programming and the other one

10763.7 --> 10770.18
is the actual language probably that

10766.22 --> 10774.979
that interface programming unit uses to

10770.18 --> 10777.08
do its thing in that language I get it

10774.979 --> 10779.679999999998
it's still weird that they called it

10777.08 --> 10783.38
Maui when it's not even the acronym

10779.68 --> 10786.02
that is just weird that's that's like oh

10783.38 --> 10788.358999999999
it just happened to call that our super

10786.02 --> 10790.939
telescope Lucifer it's like yeah but

10788.359 --> 10792.979000000001
you're Catholic yeah but I mean it just

10790.939 --> 10795.1
had to be Lucifer you know it's like you

10792.979 --> 10799.46
couldn't call it like

10795.1 --> 10802.399000000001
lucif like Lucifer or no it's just it

10799.46 --> 10805.58
has to be that that acronym

10802.399 --> 10807.939
just an accident really wasn't on

10805.58 --> 10807.939
purpose

10808.22 --> 10812.14
that's just what it feels like to me

10817.32 --> 10821.84
[Music]

10819.979 --> 10824.42
what

10821.84 --> 10826.58
you could watch people like fruit for

10824.42 --> 10829.18
hours okay that's just that just sounds

10826.58 --> 10829.18
creepy

10832.939 --> 10843.02
you split on invoke for calling the

10837.859 --> 10843.02
underlying OS at peace okay

10843.439 --> 10846.16
right

10870.2 --> 10873.34
you're a death

10874.1 --> 10876.640000000001
okay

10888.399 --> 10892.18
developer oh okay

10892.52 --> 10895.060000000001
right

10895.34 --> 10897.880000000001
foreign

10903.34 --> 10908.899
for a half a second there that you said

10905.72 --> 10911.26
I'm Bev but thank God that's not what

10908.899 --> 10911.26
you said

10913.22 --> 10918.34
you're a lot you're way too coherent to

10915.859 --> 10918.34
be Bev

um

10964.22 --> 10966.34
okay

10997.34 --> 11002.74
oh cool so it's really in the family

11000.1 --> 11005.34

11002.74 --> 11005.34

11038.14 --> 11040.199999999999
yeah

11040.62 --> 11047.34
now that's a great risk of multiple

11043.359 --> 11047.34
generation programming is

11049.779 --> 11055.359
it's going to be very tempting to just

11052.84 --> 11059.439
put on those glasses or just relax out

11055.359 --> 11062.1
eyes muscles so you'll be I gay for the

11059.439 --> 11062.1
rest of your life

11063.7 --> 11067.359
PornHub did that

11065.62 --> 11069.34
fruit

11067.359 --> 11073.380000000001
how dare you

11069.34 --> 11073.380000000001
how dare you mention that in my chat

11076.6 --> 11079.02
okay

11080.74 --> 11086.319
damaged his eye

11083.26 --> 11088.439
wait PornHub it damaged his eye I don't

11086.319 --> 11091.72
want to know how that damaged his eye

11088.439 --> 11094.439
physically but

11091.72 --> 11094.438999999998
ugh

11094.54 --> 11097.300000000001
I mean I could guess but I don't really

11096.52 --> 11100.4
want to

11097.3 --> 11100.4
[Music]

11108.66 --> 11114.96
much viewing time

11112.24 --> 11114.96
damn

11120.88 --> 11125.679999999998
right well it is like you know what it

11123.34 --> 11130.24
also is low fruit what's so terrible

11125.68 --> 11134.2
about screen time too long is when the

11130.24 --> 11135.819
screen is the only light source yeah if

11134.2 --> 11139.42
you're just staring at a freaking screen

11135.819 --> 11141.88
in the dark that will [ __ ] you up

11139.42 --> 11144.399
trust me I know I've been like computer

11141.88 --> 11146.259999999998
screen television screen addict since I

11144.399 --> 11150.519999999999
was six

11146.26 --> 11154.2
so it will [ __ ] you up

11150.52 --> 11157.84
so since I was like what is it

11154.2 --> 11160.779
24 I really figured it out

11157.84 --> 11162.279
like I whenever if I'm gonna watch a

11160.779 --> 11165.1
screen

11162.279 --> 11167.68
like it has to be other layer has to be

11165.1 --> 11169.960000000001
other light

11167.68 --> 11173.319
like there must either be sunlight

11169.96 --> 11175.0
surrounding the screen or a lamp that's

11173.319 --> 11178.18
shining on a wall

11175.0 --> 11181.96
some like it can be just the screen that

11178.18 --> 11184.54
is the light if I do that man I get like

11181.96 --> 11187.0
I can literally like it can like

11184.54 --> 11190.18
destabilize my eye muscles

11187.0 --> 11192.58
make me not capable of focusing from

11190.18 --> 11194.2
that I used to have those issues when I

11192.58 --> 11197.02
was much younger too when I would like

11194.2 --> 11198.819000000001
get super like oh I'm gonna play my

11197.02 --> 11202.0
Nintendo game

11198.819 --> 11205.18
new Nintendo game and then I did it like

11202.0 --> 11206.439
in the dark I had like oh I'm doing it

11205.18 --> 11208.720000000001
in the closet

11206.439 --> 11210.04
in the dark so that only the television

11208.72 --> 11212.14
screen was there and it could be like

11210.04 --> 11214.720000000001
completely obsessed with the game like

11212.14 --> 11218.439
whoa I'm in the world of the video game

11214.72 --> 11220.72
but that completely [ __ ] my eyes up

11218.439 --> 11224.34
back then like gave me headaches and

11220.72 --> 11224.34
[ __ ] and make me nauseated

11229.62 --> 11233.939
so then I stopped doing that

11237.939 --> 11242.859
a lamp on that yeah exactly so yeah

11241.0 --> 11247.319
whenever there's a screen there has to

11242.859 --> 11247.319
be another source of light around it

11247.72 --> 11251.64
that's just a rule for me now

11262.54 --> 11266.7
okay that's enough now Oz

11267.22 --> 11270.96
is taking a bit too far

11281.08 --> 11285.24
San Andreas uh oh

11291.88 --> 11297.278999999999
well last time I had like a real

11294.16 --> 11302.22
obsessive gaming time

11297.279 --> 11302.220000000001
was when never winter nights 2 came out

11302.439 --> 11306.819

11308.2 --> 11311.34
see if I can find them

11312.34 --> 11317.2
I made these crazy photos for the fun of

11315.16 --> 11319.979

11317.2 --> 11319.979000000001
where's it

those photos oh wait they're on the main

11369.88 --> 11374.16
page of course why am I looking there

11396.52 --> 11400.08
I look so young

11401.08 --> 11406.479
Arena still look young but I mean I

11403.3 --> 11409.06
really it's big difference though

11406.479 --> 11411.84
maybe it's just a mustache no but I do

11409.06 --> 11411.84
look different now

11415.0 --> 11418.02
look at this guy

11422.859 --> 11425.460000000001
foreign

11439.24 --> 11443.46
so yeah I was all about that game

11444.779 --> 11450.54
handsome yeah

11447.88 --> 11450.539999999999
fair enough

11457.96 --> 11461.819
my hairline was a lot more stable

11463.42 --> 11467.88
I really looked outside yeah no [ __ ]

11465.399 --> 11467.88
Sherlock

11470.68 --> 11475.08
yeah very excited because yeah I was

11505.24 --> 11509.46
I haven't ate much mm-hmm

11511.3 --> 11515.14
I know

11512.62 --> 11519.42
I'm an elf

11515.14 --> 11519.42
why do you think I say that I'm an elf

11525.34 --> 11532.859
by the way that photo was from

11528.7 --> 11532.859
specific I think 2000

11534.1 --> 11537.52
no 2007.

11540.46 --> 11543.58
hmm

11542.2 --> 11547.140000000001
guys

11543.58 --> 11547.14
13 years ago

11551.38 --> 11554.339999999998
can you believe that

11554.5 --> 11559.08
it's the freaking 13 years ago man

11565.72 --> 11568.14
okay

11570.58 --> 11576.039999999999
it's getting bigger let's get it bigger

11573.279 --> 11578.92
that's not bigger damn it

11576.04 --> 11581.380000000001
I just wanted to get the scale all right

11578.92 --> 11584.7
see if I can

11581.38 --> 11584.699999999999
really compare it

11590.02 --> 11593.399000000001
is it that much different

11597.84 --> 11607.62
let's see so see how much

11602.439 --> 11607.62
it looks oh that's good it's too big

11611.7 --> 11616.140000000001
yeah this is the proper scale

11635.8 --> 11640.8
right so yeah this is 13 years ago

11651.939 --> 11658.69
the lighting is of course very different

11655.96 --> 11664.419999999998
put some lighting over here

11658.69 --> 11666.34
[Music]

11664.42 --> 11674.64
yeah it's on the wrong side

11666.34 --> 11674.64
[Music]

11684.1 --> 11688.140000000001
so yeah hairline better

11688.779 --> 11693.7
you look a lot younger than that in the

11691.6 --> 11696.300000000001
photo

11693.7 --> 11696.300000000001
I do

11701.979 --> 11704.58
hmm

11707.14 --> 11712.479
compared to 20 yeah I know I at that age

11710.319 --> 11714.278999999999
I had to show my freaking driver's

11712.479 --> 11716.14
license because they weren't sure I was

11714.279 --> 11719.08
old enough to get the party where you

11716.14 --> 11720.278999999999
needed to be at least 14.

11719.08 --> 11721.12
yeah

11720.279 --> 11724.659
that happened

11721.12 --> 11724.659000000001
[Music]

11752.68 --> 11757.74
I got photos where I'm even younger

11754.96 --> 11757.74
looking right away

11759.88 --> 11762.539999999999
see

11766.0 --> 11769.74
I got a picture when I was six

11770.96 --> 11774.039999999999
[Music]

11774.88 --> 11778.858999999999
let's see what's a good one

11779.2 --> 11784.319000000001
is that all out the old stuff

11784.359 --> 11788.56
now what should I take 2003

11789.88 --> 11792.599999999999
four

11792.819 --> 11799.96
I'm not doing that one screw you

11797.319 --> 11803.039999999999
oh my God I look like trash

11799.96 --> 11803.039999999999
that's terrible

11805.479 --> 11809.199999999999
it's not even that I look like trashy

11807.279 --> 11811.18
it's just that ever it looks wrong but

11809.2 --> 11812.92
because it is wrong I was in a really

11811.18 --> 11817.14
bad place

11812.92 --> 11817.14
early 2000s were terrible

11819.42 --> 11825.42
what the [ __ ] am I looking at here okay

11855.7 --> 11860.460000000001
let's see if there's a good picture of

11857.979 --> 11860.46
me here

11862.42 --> 11865.8
doesn't seem like it

11866.38 --> 11868.858999999999
but

11870.16 --> 11874.319
I felt really shitty at this time

11879.819 --> 11885.519999999999
yeah

11882.22 --> 11888.119999999999
looked fine but I felt shitty

11885.52 --> 11888.12
uh

11888.3 --> 11891.819
I got more photography I don't know

11890.439 --> 11894.04
where they are

11891.819 --> 11897.479
it's not that well or it's not organized

11894.04 --> 11897.479000000001
in years unfortunately

11938.08 --> 11944.02
I mean this is one of the better photos

11941.439 --> 11945.52
where I'm actually sort of smiling like

11944.02 --> 11948.16
a human being

11945.52 --> 11951.52
not looking like a [ __ ] weirdo from

11948.16 --> 11954.88
2006 it is a photo that I use a lot too

11951.52 --> 11956.5
like in forums and [ __ ]

11954.88 --> 11960.06
I'll show it

11956.5 --> 11960.06
you've probably seen it before

11968.74 --> 11971.88
and that's this one

11972.34 --> 11975.76
that's 2006.

11984.1 --> 11989.800000000001
do I really look that different or is it

11986.859 --> 11992.62
just the lighting because I think that

11989.8 --> 11994.0
just the lighting sucks

11992.62 --> 11996.880000000001
here

11994.0 --> 12000.3
in my room

11996.88 --> 12003.438999999998
like if I'd be outside I kind of still

12000.3 --> 12003.438999999998
would look like that

12006.0 --> 12009.0
right

12018.18 --> 12023.359
see not that much has really changed

12029.0 --> 12033.319
26 they look like 16 yeah

12034.56 --> 12039.6
with a Facebook now there's no filters

12037.14 --> 12041.278999999999
on these pictures I don't take filters

12039.6 --> 12043.68
on pictures ever

12041.279 --> 12045.979000000001
I've never photoshopped my photographs

12043.68 --> 12045.979000000001
ever

12046.319 --> 12051.96
I wouldn't want to damage the Perfection

12049.2 --> 12055.52
that is my fate no I'm just kidding

12051.96 --> 12055.519999999999
it's just why the hell would I do that

12061.38 --> 12065.819
there's a lot to use them though yeah

12063.42 --> 12067.26
and they're [ __ ] [ __ ] pathetic

12065.819 --> 12069.72
[ __ ]

12067.26 --> 12071.84
you're a pathetic [ __ ] when you use a

12069.72 --> 12071.84
filter

12075.24 --> 12079.1
and I guess there are a lot of those

12083.04 --> 12088.439
anyway

12085.08 --> 12092.64
whoa going three hours 20 minutes so

12088.439 --> 12096.779
yeah I hope I made up for only half hour

12092.64 --> 12098.76
losses from last from the from this week

12096.779 --> 12101.76
sorry about that I mean it is gonna

12098.76 --> 12103.800000000001
happen more often I'm afraid weekdays I

12101.76 --> 12105.54
am gonna be like a little late and then

12103.8 --> 12108.479
it's gonna only be like one and a half

12105.54 --> 12110.220000000001
hour show that kind of thing but hey I'm

12108.479 --> 12112.858999999999
making up for it in the weekend right

12110.22 --> 12116.42
that's good right

12112.859 --> 12116.42
are you guys entertained

12130.92 --> 12135.960000000001
all good at the weekend great yeah I'm

12132.84 --> 12136.7
great I'm I mean I'm glad about this I

12135.96 --> 12140.339999999998
mean

12136.7 --> 12142.859
I'd probably be cool with doing longer

12140.34 --> 12146.24
weekday shows as I seem to like well

12142.859 --> 12149.399000000001
perform better after that first hour

12146.24 --> 12150.96
usually nowadays I can just go on longer

12149.399 --> 12153.0
but yeah if letters the way it starts

12150.96 --> 12155.399
and all that I am part of that

12153.0 --> 12157.26
but I like long weekend shows too and

12155.399 --> 12159.18
there's just a lot of people that come

12157.26 --> 12162.359
by and

12159.18 --> 12164.34
I am very much the only live show during

12162.359 --> 12167.939
this hour in the weekend

12164.34 --> 12172.439
yeah about Flat Earth oriented

12167.939 --> 12174.12
nobody else does it nobody oh maybe Paul

12172.439 --> 12176.479000000001
Cook but he doesn't really talk about

12174.12 --> 12178.979000000001
Flat Earth really he talks about

12176.479 --> 12181.819
geopolymer and all that and then

12178.979 --> 12181.819
antiquity

12183.0 --> 12187.5
but I'm glad to do it I'm glad that it's

12185.939 --> 12189.720000000001
being appreciated

12187.5 --> 12192.72
I really hope to get some support though

12189.72 --> 12192.72
also

12195.3 --> 12201.479
I'm not trying to bang you over the head

12197.399 --> 12207.539999999999
with it all that but I mean I do need it

12201.479 --> 12211.26
and last last month was uh kind of tough

12207.54 --> 12212.939
but I did manage to just save save

12211.26 --> 12215.399
enough

12212.939 --> 12218.16
thanks to to the the support that they

12215.399 --> 12221.58
did get just just there managed to get

12218.16 --> 12224.1
get through but I mean I'm gonna

12221.58 --> 12226.02
have Financial issues again soon I'm

12224.1 --> 12228.84
afraid

12226.02 --> 12231.12
I really don't like that because I just

12228.84 --> 12234.06
like to focus on the show be able to eat

12231.12 --> 12236.479000000001
it Illuminati Castle have a regular

12234.06 --> 12236.479
smoke

12237.06 --> 12243.239
but everything's so [ __ ] up expensive

12239.939 --> 12246.42
and the Netherlands already was very

12243.239 --> 12249.319
expensive and now it's basically doubled

12246.42 --> 12253.68
in price without income going up

12249.319 --> 12255.239
and it's really bad in that sense there

12253.68 --> 12258.300000000001
are people out there

12255.239 --> 12260.039999999999
that are not like good speakers good

12258.3 --> 12263.34
looking whatever

12260.04 --> 12265.02
right they can't just like do a show and

12263.34 --> 12268.2
like get some funds together they don't

12265.02 --> 12272.0
know how to do that they're just [ __ ]

12268.2 --> 12272.0
they're more [ __ ] than I am

12272.819 --> 12278.76
I'm just barely holding on they really

12275.64 --> 12281.039999999999
have to scramble and it's like I I'm not

12278.76 --> 12284.819
happy about it I'm not happy about that

12281.04 --> 12287.279
the condition financially of my country

12284.819 --> 12288.239
because also I know that it can be

12287.279 --> 12291.54
stopped

12288.239 --> 12294.779
I know it can be stopped it's like being

12291.54 --> 12296.819000000001
kept like this artificially as a

12294.779 --> 12298.859
political tool

12296.819 --> 12303.359
but the political tool is literally

12298.859 --> 12306.84
being used against us against the people

12303.359 --> 12312.12
like this [ __ ] war in Ukraine

12306.84 --> 12315.3
is about the elites war on Russia

12312.12 --> 12317.880000000001
but that war is also a war against us

12315.3 --> 12319.858999999999
because they literally steal our money

12317.88 --> 12322.08
to do this thing

12319.859 --> 12324.6
that we don't get to say and we don't

12322.08 --> 12327.84
get to vote on it they're just wasting

12324.6 --> 12328.859
our money on this completely unwinnable

12327.84 --> 12332.64
War

12328.859 --> 12334.380000000001
and thereby they are attacking us it's a

12332.64 --> 12337.14
war on us

12334.38 --> 12339.239
the war on us is literally giving our

12337.14 --> 12341.099999999999
money away without us having any say

12339.239 --> 12344.16
about it

12341.1 --> 12347.7
that's like a war it's Criminal

12344.16 --> 12349.56
and it's useless anyway like I don't

12347.7 --> 12351.54
even at this point it doesn't even seem

12349.56 --> 12353.34
like they're giving the money away just

12351.54 --> 12357.239000000001
so they can win now they're giving the

12353.34 --> 12360.06
money away so that we become broke

12357.239 --> 12364.26
that's the reason they're not giving the

12360.06 --> 12365.939
money so they can win they can't win all

12364.26 --> 12367.62
the money in the world will not make

12365.939 --> 12370.62
Ukraine win this war

12367.62 --> 12374.34
but they're giving the money away so

12370.62 --> 12377.58
that we lose the money it seems like

12374.34 --> 12379.92
that is the point the point is to make

12377.58 --> 12383.18
super rich countries that kept

12379.92 --> 12389.12
everything together broke and destitute

12383.18 --> 12389.12
for nothing that seems to be the purpose

12389.88 --> 12397.619999999999
it's like this entire Ukrainian war is

12392.819 --> 12400.8
just a sham-cover [ __ ] story just to

12397.62 --> 12402.859
ensure that Western countries are

12400.8 --> 12406.019999999999
completely made broke

12402.859 --> 12408.84
that I think is the purpose of the war

12406.02 --> 12412.5
not the war because the war was never

12408.84 --> 12415.56
going to be won and they knew it

12412.5 --> 12417.239
they're just doing the war to make the

12415.56 --> 12421.619999999999
West broke

12417.239 --> 12424.5
that is the reason it's happening not to

12421.62 --> 12426.060000000001
win a war from Russia it's to make the

12424.5 --> 12429.239
West broke

12426.06 --> 12431.42
that seems to be the primary reason for

12429.239 --> 12431.42
it

12437.76 --> 12443.18
and in that sense it's the the war is

12440.279 --> 12443.18
actually on the people

12443.34 --> 12447.84
that it's physically taking place in

12445.62 --> 12451.34
Ukraine is

12447.84 --> 12451.34
barely of consequence

12452.1 --> 12456.6
there's not a difference going to be

12453.66 --> 12459.539999999999
made there except for well more dead and

12456.6 --> 12462.66
more landmines and that kind of crap

12459.54 --> 12465.800000000001
but there there's no map lines gonna be

12462.66 --> 12465.8
redrawn here

12471.319 --> 12476.1
except for well the one that Russia Drew

12474.18 --> 12478.800000000001
but the Don bass and all that yeah

12476.1 --> 12481.140000000001
that's that's how it is now

12478.8 --> 12484.739
there's nothing you can do about it you

12481.14 --> 12487.319
can like it doesn't matter what it is

12484.739 --> 12489.479
no amount of people that you could kill

12487.319 --> 12492.539999999999
no amount of things that you could

12489.479 --> 12495.26
destroy is going to change it nothing

12492.54 --> 12495.26
will

12506.819 --> 12510.319
so yeah that's the thing too

12510.54 --> 12514.5
and it's getting recognized by the way

12512.52 --> 12518.04
yeah my prediction

12514.5 --> 12521.04
is getting very much through now yeah

12518.04 --> 12524.0
that prediction that I made

12521.04 --> 12527.7
that I made

12524.0 --> 12530.64
Russia will win it will win guess what's

12527.7 --> 12533.279
gonna happen Russia's winning

12530.64 --> 12534.72
yeah there's literally reports already

12533.279 --> 12538.08
getting out

12534.72 --> 12540.778999999999
Ukrainian soldiers are surrendering in

12538.08 --> 12543.06
well 100 percent

12540.779 --> 12546.060000000001
like as soon as they can get away from

12543.06 --> 12549.18
the [ __ ] executioners people that are

12546.06 --> 12552.66
basically the slave soldiers

12549.18 --> 12555.06
slave masters that are like you fight or

12552.66 --> 12557.039999999999
you die because they do that [ __ ] there

12555.06 --> 12559.019999999999
it's like if you refuse to fight they

12557.04 --> 12561.479000000001
literally execute you even if there's

12559.02 --> 12564.060000000001
zero percent chance of winning

12561.479 --> 12566.039999999999
so they're just like your entire units

12564.06 --> 12568.019999999999
are surrendering because they're like oh

12566.04 --> 12570.300000000001
we're finally Out Of Reach of those

12568.02 --> 12572.7
[ __ ] executioners

12570.3 --> 12574.92
immediately surrender

12572.7 --> 12577.939
and Russians are very eloquent with it

12574.92 --> 12580.739
they know they know they are like yep

12577.939 --> 12584.399
we're just trying to prevent as many

12580.739 --> 12587.1
Slavic people from getting killed here

12584.399 --> 12588.66
which is the best thing they could the

12587.1 --> 12591.319
best stance they could have and but

12588.66 --> 12591.319
that's happening

12593.22 --> 12598.319
and it's great I'm very glad that

12595.56 --> 12600.72
they're not just all dying

12598.319 --> 12602.699999999999
that they're actually capable of

12600.72 --> 12605.16
surrendering without getting executed

12602.7 --> 12606.779
very happy about that

12605.16 --> 12611.22
because

12606.779 --> 12613.76
despite this freaking satanic [ __ ] Nazi

12611.22 --> 12616.679999999998
being in power there

12613.76 --> 12618.72
ukrainians are actually like kind of

12616.68 --> 12620.399
beautiful people

12618.72 --> 12624.72
a lot of them

12620.399 --> 12626.519999999999
and really nice also a lot of them and I

12624.72 --> 12628.08
really don't like that that they're just

12626.52 --> 12629.880000000001
getting slaughtered like this I think

12628.08 --> 12633.2
it's horrendous

12629.88 --> 12633.199999999999
I think it's terrible

12635.34 --> 12642.479
yeah and I also think it's definitely

12638.76 --> 12646.16
not the [ __ ] Russian's fault

12642.479 --> 12646.16
they didn't start anything

12649.92 --> 12657.54
I'm sick of these Ukrainian Nazi

12653.939 --> 12660.18
Satanist freaks slaughtering their own

12657.54 --> 12663.54
people and then blaming it on Russia and

12660.18 --> 12666.960000000001
then the freaking crazy ass satanic

12663.54 --> 12670.2
media in the west literally echoing that

12666.96 --> 12672.56
nonsense propaganda it's blatantly

12670.2 --> 12677.16
reversed World nonsense

12672.56 --> 12680.819
echoing that [ __ ] I can't believe it

12677.16 --> 12686.279
and I I really think that media that do

12680.819 --> 12686.278999999999
that should be criminally persecuted

12688.38 --> 12697.92
you're rolling out War propaganda lies

12693.96 --> 12700.519999999999
that are covering up for blatant war

12697.92 --> 12700.52
crimes

12701.76 --> 12707.880000000001
in my opinion if you as a media

12704.76 --> 12711.300000000001
organization cooperate with the covering

12707.88 --> 12713.699999999999
up of blatant war crimes then you're an

12711.3 --> 12716.699999999999
accomplice

12713.7 --> 12720.359
I don't know how that works legally but

12716.7 --> 12723.319000000001
it seems logical that there should be a

12720.359 --> 12723.319
punishment for that

12726.239 --> 12730.22
have I been to Russia no

12732.66 --> 12737.66
East Germany is as far as I've ever been

12735.18 --> 12737.66
East

12741.239 --> 12745.739
stop sending more it's about damn time

12743.76 --> 12747.899
Elizabeth happy

12745.739 --> 12751.68
it's about I mean this is gonna end

12747.899 --> 12754.5
quick and I want I want [ __ ] silencio

12751.68 --> 12756.18
I want them executed I want to see it I

12754.5 --> 12758.279
want to see the [ __ ] video of his

12756.18 --> 12761.1
execution I don't care if it's not gonna

12758.279 --> 12764.42
be horrendous enough for him because he

12761.1 --> 12768.42
deserves a [ __ ] pyre for this [ __ ]

12764.42 --> 12768.42
absolutely pyre

12770.46 --> 12777.479
public pyre on the Square burning

12774.479 --> 12777.479
burning

12778.14 --> 12783.119999999999
they are not in a hot oven on a pyre

12780.96 --> 12787.14
slow burning

12783.12 --> 12789.54
on record or the more painful terrifying

12787.14 --> 12791.22
death he should experience that he

12789.54 --> 12793.319000000001
should go out that way for what he's

12791.22 --> 12795.66
done

12793.319 --> 12797.64
absolutely

12795.66 --> 12800.16
a pyre

12797.64 --> 12801.96
and probably the the Ukraine is probably

12800.16 --> 12803.3
want to do that and they should

12801.96 --> 12807.06
absolutely

12803.3 --> 12810.0
be allowed to do that

12807.06 --> 12813.899
after the trial [ __ ] is done and it's

12810.0 --> 12816.359
it's obvious how zielinski is like this

12813.899 --> 12819.358999999999
is like the bottom [ __ ] of the whole

12816.359 --> 12823.68
project he is obviously there to take

12819.359 --> 12826.140000000001
the fall for all criminal things which

12823.68 --> 12828.12
is a lot of globalists

12826.14 --> 12830.88
a lot of globalists getting involved

12828.12 --> 12834.060000000001
doing horrendous [ __ ] organ trafficking

12830.88 --> 12838.92
who knows how terrible this is but

12834.06 --> 12842.76
zelenski is obviously there as the

12838.92 --> 12844.02
bottom [ __ ] to take the blame for all

12842.76 --> 12846.479
of it

12844.02 --> 12849.66
you do understand that right

12846.479 --> 12850.92
you do understand that with everything I

12849.66 --> 12853.619999999999
mean

12850.92 --> 12855.42
there's literally no other way this

12853.62 --> 12859.279
thing could have been

12855.42 --> 12859.279
that is what it must be

12867.42 --> 12872.42
they see the herb of that stuff for a

12869.939 --> 12872.42
long either

12874.5 --> 12879.62
your son has been in the Kremlin for a

12876.479 --> 12879.619999999999
new year so oh cool

12884.279 --> 12890.220000000001
yeah how did they do that in New Year's

12887.88 --> 12891.839999999998
celebration in in Russia I have no ideas

12890.22 --> 12895.08
it's kind of the same as in the west

12891.84 --> 12897.3
right it's just fireworks and

12895.08 --> 12900.18
are they publicly allowed to use

12897.3 --> 12904.519999999999
fireworks like in the Netherlands and

12900.18 --> 12904.52
some other European countries

12905.04 --> 12911.54
or is it only the state fires fireworks

12908.64 --> 12911.539999999999
how does it work there

12919.14 --> 12924.199999999999
you know

12921.479 --> 12924.199999999999
lucky

12926.88 --> 12930.358999999999
I mean Rush has some really good

12929.04 --> 12932.640000000001
programmers

12930.359 --> 12935.84
it is the country of programmers that

12932.64 --> 12935.84
you realize that right

12939.42 --> 12945.6
it's like I think that

12942.6 --> 12947.7
like Russia has very significant amount

12945.6 --> 12950.66
of programmers for

12947.7 --> 12950.66
Well the West

12957.359 --> 12963.479000000001
like go to any programmers Department

12960.14 --> 12965.46
you I guarantee you're gonna find a rush

12963.479 --> 12967.38
in there

12965.46 --> 12969.119999999999
because there's a lot of Russians that

12967.38 --> 12972.858999999999
they're just good programmers always

12969.12 --> 12972.859
have been since the start

12974.42 --> 12979.859
right and our talk programmers I don't

12976.92 --> 12983.22
mean all managing computer I mean like

12979.859 --> 12985.92
actual complicated programming and stuff

12983.22 --> 12988.319
like they pioneered stuff programming in

12985.92 --> 12992.84
ways well America did too

12988.319 --> 12992.84
but Russia's also been at it

12993.84 --> 12996.14
foreign

13007.06 --> 13013.72
from Street Fighter

13010.04 --> 13017.720000000001
quickly change the channel

13013.72 --> 13019.76
sorry no when I think of Russia I

13017.72 --> 13023.679999999998
definitely don't think of Zangief since

13019.76 --> 13023.68
he was the complete cartoon character

13037.72 --> 13044.5
python C plus plus what

13041.72 --> 13044.5
when

13062.899 --> 13067.0
all right the Como virus yeah fair

13064.819 --> 13067.0
enough

13067.16 --> 13072.5
right anyway programmers good to have

13070.64 --> 13075.64
some connections to Russia

13072.5 --> 13075.64
I wish I had more

13076.1 --> 13079.880000000001
it's just that I don't really know a lot

13078.08 --> 13083.539999999999
of Russia there are I think some

13079.88 --> 13085.58
Russians that are like around

13083.54 --> 13088.220000000001
the other day I was just asking somebody

13085.58 --> 13090.64
for directions that person seemed to be

13088.22 --> 13090.64
Russian

13101.06 --> 13106.1
or maybe he was Ukrainian I don't know I

13104.06 --> 13108.439
mean ukrainians and Russians are they

13106.1 --> 13111.319
have trouble keeping them apart

13108.439 --> 13113.42
is there like a really distinct typical

13111.319 --> 13115.1
difference between ukrainians and

13113.42 --> 13118.7
Russians

13115.1 --> 13121.04
because I can not really tell

13118.7 --> 13123.439
it's weird to me that oh you're we're

13121.04 --> 13125.18
gonna kill all the Russians in Ukraine

13123.439 --> 13126.92
like how the [ __ ] can you tell the

13125.18 --> 13128.84
difference other than whatever is

13126.92 --> 13131.26
registered how the hell do you even see

13128.84 --> 13131.26
the difference

13137.239 --> 13142.539999999999
does anybody know

13139.22 --> 13142.539999999999
here in the chat

13146.18 --> 13150.68
you can start a war to keep them for

13148.88 --> 13153.14
okay that's funny

13150.68 --> 13155.779
that is funny no food

13153.14 --> 13158.68
I'm sure Russians would appreciate the

13155.779 --> 13158.68
joke there

13170.12 --> 13175.939
it's just that how can they tell

13174.14 --> 13178.778999999999
they're like looking like a at a group

13175.939 --> 13182.239
and they're like there's a lot of that

13178.779 --> 13184.279
opposite race there like oh I'm

13182.239 --> 13186.14
Ukrainian oh there's a lot of Russians

13184.279 --> 13187.880000000001
in that group I can see it other than

13186.14 --> 13189.68
them wearing the Russian flag or

13187.88 --> 13192.319
something like

13189.68 --> 13194.66
how do they know the difference

13192.319 --> 13197.239
other than through background checks or

13194.66 --> 13199.42
something like can they really tell the

13197.239 --> 13199.42
difference

13199.76 --> 13205.58
it's like oh that's a Russian oh that's

13202.52 --> 13208.939
your Ukrainian other than flags and

13205.58 --> 13211.779
uniform badges or something

13208.939 --> 13211.779
I don't get it

13220.64 --> 13225.5
you can't travel to Russia until it's

13223.1 --> 13227.359
all done yeah yeah yeah now that's

13225.5 --> 13230.0
sensible no fruit

13227.359 --> 13231.62
accent Maybe

13230.0 --> 13235.399
hmm

13231.62 --> 13237.800000000001
right but you can't see it thus so it is

13235.399 --> 13240.08
really all about the culture it is

13237.8 --> 13244.759999999998
purely cultural differences

13240.08 --> 13244.76
they don't look any different then

13246.2 --> 13252.739000000001
other than all they're like slightly

13248.779 --> 13255.460000000001
More Southern looking Russian like right

13252.739 --> 13258.5
they're basically just South Western

13255.46 --> 13260.358999999999
Russians that you could just fit them in

13258.5 --> 13261.8
that entire Southwest that you probably

13260.359 --> 13263.6
wouldn't even be able to tell the

13261.8 --> 13265.46
difference between any of it

13263.6 --> 13268.04
right I mean you go further north they

13265.46 --> 13271.759999999998
get more pale go further east they

13268.04 --> 13274.279
become more [ __ ] but I mean

13271.76 --> 13276.319
there's not like oh Gloom there's their

13274.279 --> 13278.239
ukrainians oh they're looking like quite

13276.319 --> 13281.119999999999
different oh they have this typical

13278.239 --> 13282.979
thing now that's how you see no no it's

13281.12 --> 13285.630000000001
just like yeah but just Russians they

13282.979 --> 13287.858999999999
just look like Russians foreign

13285.63 --> 13290.899
[Music]

13287.859 --> 13293.359
by their accent by their language or by

13290.899 --> 13295.939
the any badges or a flag but other than

13293.359 --> 13298.84
that like you can't look like oh that's

13295.939 --> 13301.1
a Ukrainian and that's a Russian

13298.84 --> 13304.899
I don't know

13301.1 --> 13304.899000000001
well that's also why I'm asking

13309.38 --> 13316.759999999998
so since Ukraine was a part USSR now not

13313.279 --> 13318.26
just USSR it was a part of Russia ukuma

13316.76 --> 13321.979
virus

13318.26 --> 13326.0
it's been a part of Russia after the

13321.979 --> 13330.019999999999
USSR it became Ukraine

13326.0 --> 13331.04
before the USSR Ukraine was part of

13330.02 --> 13334.479000000001
Russia

13331.04 --> 13334.479000000001
I always was part of Russia

13339.319 --> 13347.08
like a self-sufficient State like

13342.08 --> 13347.08
Ukraine that's not that's very recent

13347.12 --> 13352.160000000002
I mean maybe in the very far past it had

13349.819 --> 13353.84
like a separated state or whatever

13352.16 --> 13356.3
before

13353.84 --> 13357.739
the Russian

13356.3 --> 13360.08
yeah although I didn't know before

13357.739 --> 13362.06
desire conquest or whatever happened in

13360.08 --> 13363.8
the past I'm not gonna have a very

13362.06 --> 13366.319
elaborate history they know all about it

13363.8 --> 13369.019999999999
I know nothing about it it's elaborate

13366.319 --> 13371.66
right so maybe Ukraine in the fair far

13369.02 --> 13374.54
past and then I don't know in the fifth

13371.66 --> 13377.359
century or something maybe they were

13374.54 --> 13379.640000000001
a separate nation before they became

13377.359 --> 13382.58
entangled with Russia but before the

13379.64 --> 13385.0
Soviet Union it was already a part of

13382.58 --> 13385.0
Russia

13393.2 --> 13399.58
right or or am I like completely [ __ ]

13396.8 --> 13399.58
it up right now

13400.28 --> 13405.25
[Music]

13408.38 --> 13411.339999999998
let me see

13412.399 --> 13419.319
during the 15th 14th century territory

13415.7 --> 13419.319000000001
rule for external powers

13419.66 --> 13425.869
Rebel for Cossacks

13422.79 --> 13425.869
[Music]

13427.58 --> 13432.439
Russia remained a matter of scholarly

13430.279 --> 13434.859
God what

13432.439 --> 13434.859
foreign

13438.14 --> 13443.599999999999
oh my God this is so

13440.359 --> 13445.279
ah hectic

13443.6 --> 13448.239
it's giving me a headache trying to

13445.279 --> 13448.239
decipher all this

13452.72 --> 13455.199999999999
hmm

13455.899 --> 13461.84
okay so maybe they were sort of separate

13459.08 --> 13464.06
then a lot of it

13461.84 --> 13466.16
I know maybe Ukraine is just kind of

13464.06 --> 13469.22
like

13466.16 --> 13471.02
Russia's freezeland

13469.22 --> 13473.3
like we have freezeland here in the

13471.02 --> 13475.58
Netherlands but it's like it is separate

13473.3 --> 13477.619999999999
they even have their own language

13475.58 --> 13480.5
they do speak Dutch

13477.62 --> 13483.34
but it is a province and they are so

13480.5 --> 13483.34
maybe it's like that

13508.7 --> 13513.140000000001
you don't do history they know yeah USSR

13511.52 --> 13516.739
yeah of course they were part of it then

13513.14 --> 13518.96
but I think that they were part of it

13516.739 --> 13521.539999999999
I mean they've been like a province and

13518.96 --> 13524.419999999998
then in Wartime sometimes like they go

13521.54 --> 13526.880000000001
rebellious and stuff

13524.42 --> 13529.64
but I mean Tech it's never been like oh

13526.88 --> 13532.339999999998
yeah completely independent Ukraine I

13529.64 --> 13533.84
don't think that even existed at any

13532.34 --> 13536.0
stage

13533.84 --> 13539.739
not from the what I could when I was

13536.0 --> 13543.22
browsing through Wikipedia it didn't

13539.739 --> 13543.22
show that

13574.76 --> 13578.319
who are these people

13580.52 --> 13584.2
looking in the wrong chat

13607.939 --> 13612.56
right anyway I think I'm gonna round out

13610.1 --> 13613.880000000001
the show guys it's been almost four

13612.56 --> 13616.46
hours

13613.88 --> 13620.06
three hours 45 minutes

13616.46 --> 13623.119999999999
and I'm getting kind of tired I need to

13620.06 --> 13625.96
get some lunch again it's been a lot of

13623.12 --> 13625.960000000001
fun though the show

13627.319 --> 13633.8
talking about space deserts

13630.08 --> 13635.779
meet your showers yeah that's cute cool

13633.8 --> 13639.08
well they break up don't they they crash

13635.779 --> 13642.08
into each other so it should be all sand

13639.08 --> 13644.239
meteor Fields shouldn't really be fields

13642.08 --> 13647.12
for very long they should all just turn

13644.239 --> 13649.1
into space deserts

13647.12 --> 13651.08
right also lay down the knowing witch

13649.1 --> 13653.42
path experiment how it actually works

13651.08 --> 13656.899
nobody freaking asked me about it even

13653.42 --> 13660.26
once by the way for the record

13656.899 --> 13662.778999999999
what I did explain well the recent

13660.26 --> 13666.380000000001
understanding that I've attained of it

13662.779 --> 13669.319000000001
thanks to QE explaining it again to me

13666.38 --> 13671.72
but without drawing in the ontological

13669.319 --> 13673.519999999999
Primitive stuff which was technically

13671.72 --> 13674.899
not involved

13673.52 --> 13677.960000000001
it's

13674.899 --> 13679.939
proof for it for the ontological

13677.96 --> 13682.46
Primitive but it's not literally a part

13679.939 --> 13684.319
of the actual experiment

13682.46 --> 13685.46
so that's at the beginning of this large

13684.319 --> 13688.16
show

13685.46 --> 13690.919999999998
and then of course I wrote out my age of

13688.16 --> 13695.08
paradox got back into my old

13690.92 --> 13695.08
time travel based sci-fi story

13695.12 --> 13699.02
that I wrote years ago and read out some

13697.819 --> 13701.479
of that

13699.02 --> 13704.42
so it's been a very diverse show today

13701.479 --> 13708.08
hope you all appreciated it I really

13704.42 --> 13711.04
hope to also get some support for this

13708.08 --> 13711.039999999999
I mean really

13713.06 --> 13717.26
so yeah

13714.859 --> 13719.359

13752.42 --> 13756.14
