4.339 --> 11.34
good morning welcome to flatter the

8.16 --> 15.059000000000001
earlybird number 88 I'm your host

11.34 --> 19.05
Arwen and today I decided to start a

15.059 --> 24.049999999999997
little bit early because it's a week

19.05 --> 28.23
early and yesterday went on so long okay

24.05 --> 31.14
maybe I will start a bit earlier and

28.23 --> 35.579
just it's probably gonna fill up anyway

31.14 --> 39.59
it's not like in recent times like it

35.579 --> 39.59
was what do I talk about

41.329 --> 51.05
so yeah the show can go on

45.18 --> 59.55
for a while if left to its devices

51.05 --> 65.149
anyway see you voyage Steve wasn't chat

59.55 --> 65.149
usual [ __ ] yous furious punch

72.82 --> 75.47999999999999
the

77.56 --> 81.87
a dry day it seems at least

84.27 --> 86.99
gray

87.24 --> 98.16
super Colts a bit windy it's completely

93.51 --> 100.29
different everything else like everyday

98.16 --> 104.24
almost seems like a different day these

100.29 --> 104.24000000000001
days what's going on

110.68 --> 121.38000000000001
yeah

113.01 --> 123.54
a rosin tinted monocle yeah it's it's

121.38 --> 127.64999999999999
kind of interesting like a guy keep

123.54 --> 132.48000000000002
throwing back but yeah the the 82 keeps

127.65 --> 137.70000000000002
on getting like really a lot and lot of

132.48 --> 140.13
comments people like really make big

137.7 --> 144.14999999999998
statements and it's fascinating to see

140.13 --> 148.14
and I'm also basically getting to know a

144.15 --> 153.53
lot of people because of it and that's

148.14 --> 153.52999999999997
like really special to me that

157.91 --> 161.71
yeah the whole thing it basically

162.08 --> 167.27
forces people to either retreat and

164.81 --> 169.46
ignore it or to reveal something inside

167.27 --> 173.98000000000002
of them how they reflect on it and that

169.46 --> 173.98000000000002
is it is fascinating to see

175.95 --> 182.64
anyway that's mostly it yeah and going

180.42 --> 186.76999999999998
around and just looking at videos it's

182.64 --> 189.14999999999998
just full full time YouTube these days

186.77 --> 192.36
it's like I'm almost starting to get

189.15 --> 194.64000000000001
worried like yeah do I really get the

192.36 --> 196.95000000000002
opportunity to even step away because

194.64 --> 198.89999999999998
there's always some live stream and that

196.95 --> 201.01999999999998
is always really good one way or the

198.9 --> 201.02
other

208.79 --> 214.239
also

211.12 --> 218.769
having really vivid dreams again I think

214.239 --> 221.26
although I remember little it's just so

218.769 --> 224.769
much information coming from all sides

221.26 --> 229.75
literally all sides everyone or people I

224.769 --> 232.18
know just when I talk about things what

229.75 --> 237.79
they say back I hear so much in what

232.18 --> 242.64000000000001
they say it's just makes me kind of

237.79 --> 246.48
nervous sometimes but

242.64 --> 250.52999999999997
yeah that's for my chemistry I'm doing

246.48 --> 252.57
pretty good like it's still happening

250.53 --> 255.29
down there it's like a snare and it's

252.57 --> 259.95
still somewhat vibrating but at least

255.29 --> 260.43
it's not ya driving me nuts anymore so

259.95 --> 264.14
much

260.43 --> 267.71
although yeah it keeps coming back

264.14 --> 267.71
sensations of loneliness

268.37 --> 275.0
sometimes shocks of fear especially when

272.04 --> 281.13
more synchronizations reveal themselves

275.0 --> 283.53
and oh boy boy boy do they my god and

281.13 --> 287.65999999999997
it's been talking about the concept of

283.53 --> 287.65999999999997
it what that is

293.469 --> 299.24899999999997
it is such a fascinating concept just by

296.409 --> 299.24899999999997
itself need

299.81 --> 303.12
the

301.38 --> 308.9
yeah and that don't take it literally

303.12 --> 313.64
but like the parallel world between

308.9 --> 318.15
psychology and the spiritual and I've

313.64 --> 326.7
yeah learn to approach things from both

318.15 --> 329.98999999999995
sides and it is really heavy stuff again

326.7 --> 336.39
it's always heavy everything's a happy

329.99 --> 342.08
getting kind of sick of heavy is what it

336.39 --> 342.08
is and so getting really meta talky

357.36 --> 366.36
yeah yeah I wonder if you guys see it

360.18 --> 369.99
too and and please don't tell me it's

366.36 --> 374.93
just me because look about

369.99 --> 374.93
synchronicities I get them so much that

375.05 --> 379.77000000000004
yeah you know it's pretty cool when you

377.789 --> 384.03
find synchronicity it's like oh wow

379.77 --> 387.04999999999995
that's so amazing and miraculous but

384.03 --> 390.38899999999995
what if you had like really in your face

387.05 --> 396.71000000000004
synchronicities three to five times a

390.389 --> 400.259
day every day every day is it still

396.71 --> 406.77
fascinating and special then you know

400.259 --> 409.74
and it it's what is fascinating about it

406.77 --> 414.74
though it is the psychology approach of

409.74 --> 414.74
it so many ways

415.689 --> 424.939
because I've been thinking like yet in

419.029 --> 427.969
the when you basically conclude that the

424.939 --> 432.139
the spirit and other people and our

427.969 --> 437.389
connections are all energy and the rest

432.139 --> 441.889
of it is basically filler then yeah

437.389 --> 445.869
synchronicities you know the when you

441.889 --> 449.029
experience them and especially a lot

445.869 --> 452.959
from an individual perspective from a

449.029 --> 456.379
first response perspective it will

452.959 --> 460.039
always appear like the world outside has

456.379 --> 464.269
been adapted to you like it's directly

460.039 --> 466.30899999999997
communicating to you but and that that

464.269 --> 469.42900000000003
gives all kinds of Luciferian

466.309 --> 473.41900000000004
suggestions with them like oh my god am

469.429 --> 474.469
i some kind of uber thing but here's the

473.419 --> 480.61899999999997
tricky part

474.469 --> 482.86899999999997
if we are all connected then maybe it is

480.619 --> 485.36
my being through time that in that very

482.869 --> 488.809
moment is actually the one that is

485.36 --> 492.259
adapting to what is outside or maybe we

488.809 --> 496.309
are all just that way and I see it more

492.259 --> 499.339
clearly but from the personal

496.309 --> 503.17900000000003
perspective point of view mistake it

499.339 --> 505.669
like it's all adapting to me well maybe

503.179 --> 507.94899999999996
nothing is adapting maybe it has always

505.669 --> 510.109
been like this and synchronicities are

507.949 --> 512.2090000000001
constantly everywhere every second

510.109 --> 514.819
everything is one giant synchronicity

512.209 --> 518.1199999999999
and it's all a matter of how much can

514.819 --> 522.819
your individual perspective handle in

518.12 --> 522.819
this yeah

524.949 --> 527.8499999999999
cuz again

528.01 --> 533.73
like all power be it knowledge

536.53 --> 541.7099999999999
passion

538.7 --> 543.839
even love all of it

541.71 --> 549.779
when it becomes really strong then

543.839 --> 553.32
things start to start to happen like

549.779 --> 555.62
that will make yeah distortions will

553.32 --> 561.8000000000001
will happen and I think that it is

555.62 --> 564.69
fundamentally based on on the ego that

561.8 --> 570.06
basically reaches out from within you

564.69 --> 573.2090000000001
stops insights stop certain yeah it

570.06 --> 576.2399999999999
holds the the whole growing process to

573.209 --> 581.8699999999999
do taking on more power of whatever

576.24 --> 581.87
direction and halts it in it tracks it

582.649 --> 592.35
this is so ethereal stuff that's but it

589.56 --> 594.4799999999999
is it is interesting to see that and

592.35 --> 596.4300000000001
also to realize that yeah I'm being

594.48 --> 600.57
bombarded with all these synchronicities

596.43 --> 604.5
and it gives me like a frightening sense

600.57 --> 608.1800000000001
that apparently I'm really important or

604.5 --> 614.31
something not just to God which is

608.18 --> 615.93
obvious because everyone is but to this

614.31 --> 619.9499999999999
world somehow it's such a weird

615.93 --> 623.5699999999999
sensation and it's not pleasant really I

619.95 --> 625.7090000000001
don't like it I don't like him like

623.57 --> 627.2090000000001
everybody having their eyes on it it's

625.709 --> 628.9799999999999
so weird because on the other hand yeah

627.209 --> 633.1199999999999
I'm doing me YouTube show and I kind of

628.98 --> 636.839
do want want people to get to know me

633.12 --> 638.97
and everything but what the

636.839 --> 641.57
synchronicity suggests is that the

638.97 --> 646.23
actual amount of people watching is

641.57 --> 650.22
massive and that just and that it's kind

646.23 --> 652.6800000000001
of hidden almost like the world I don't

650.22 --> 654.1700000000001
know even openly or the world in the

652.68 --> 656.0
dark world the parallel world

654.17 --> 660.37
or entangled on that are playing like a

656.0 --> 664.45
game with me and my my consciousness

660.37 --> 670.94
what is what is real and what is hidden

664.45 --> 674.1400000000001
it is such a puzzle a multi-dimensional

670.94 --> 674.1400000000001
puzzle and

680.88 --> 686.9399999999999
and I'm just gonna study it and see if I

684.87 --> 690.98
can make some kind of sense of it then

686.94 --> 690.98
share that others

697.3 --> 701.91
yeah my hair Smith fluffy today

721.02 --> 731.42
right yes that I'm starting a bit early

723.99 --> 731.42
so people might drop in a bit slower

732.28 --> 737.8199999999999
see us as heroes in Santa Monica called

734.92 --> 737.8199999999999
UT Bennett

740.14 --> 749.41
T matrix don't throw the UK Papa Fleur

744.459 --> 753.75
and you filled unbelievable productions

749.41 --> 753.75
Ren cook yeah

785.03 --> 787.66
it's

787.96 --> 793.12
yeah well after after everything I'm

790.29 --> 796.9599999999999
telling you guys you guys must feel that

793.12 --> 800.98
I have pressure on me whether this all

796.96 --> 803.32
be rambling just some weird

800.98 --> 807.94
ethereal psychosis or whatever

803.32 --> 810.61
interesting or maybe I really you feel I

807.94 --> 812.32
really did stump onto something real and

810.61 --> 814.8000000000001
you feel the seriousness of it

812.32 --> 820.12
but I'm under a lot of pressure and

814.8 --> 823.42
every time I realized like guys girls I

820.12 --> 825.48
I basically just want to have a normal

823.42 --> 825.4799999999999
life

829.8 --> 839.8499999999999
but is it so hard to just get a normal

835.92 --> 842.429
life yeah what is a normal life you know

839.85 --> 847.2900000000001
in this world and that is a bit of the

842.429 --> 851.9889999999999
problem there seems to be this weird

847.29 --> 851.9889999999999
spiritual tug-of-war going on and

855.56 --> 859.79
yeah what do you do with it it almost

857.959 --> 863.2589999999999
feel like the tug of war is gonna blow

859.79 --> 866.959
everything up one way or the other but

863.259 --> 868.85
it's not really balancing or is it is it

866.959 --> 872.3889999999999
really balancing is it supposed to be

868.85 --> 878.4490000000001
balancing or is it supposed to just end

872.389 --> 881.779
I I don't know I don't know if anybody

878.449 --> 887.42
out there knows I don't know if even the

881.779 --> 892.129
dark ones know maybe this is part of the

887.42 --> 895.87
greater mystery like this setup figuring

892.129 --> 895.87
out why

896.64 --> 903.09
and then in the end look this it's

899.4 --> 910.88
pretty harsh but in the end it might all

903.09 --> 910.88
turn out to be just a giant distraction

911.75 --> 917.85
to at least have a good time

914.63 --> 923.46
it sounds so cruel in a way especially

917.85 --> 926.0
if you continue the reasoning from that

923.46 --> 926.0
point on

957.04 --> 960.04
yes

960.59 --> 963.3100000000001
Cheers

968.1 --> 970.85
anyway

976.98 --> 983.6700000000001
it's really apparently going down in

980.029 --> 988.3389999999999
Brazil and so Eva's getting a lot more

983.67 --> 988.3389999999999
media situation and

991.24 --> 999.4300000000001
it all just seems like the same to me

996.12 --> 1007.2
it's the tug of war and the tug of war

999.43 --> 1010.77
is hitting places in the world and it's

1007.2 --> 1015.7700000000001
all equal it's so crazy but to me it all

1010.77 --> 1020.36
feels the same it isn't the same but

1015.77 --> 1020.36
it's an equal amount of damage

1024.47 --> 1032.98
with an equal amount of unbalanced as a

1027.289 --> 1032.98
result how crazy is that

1044.6 --> 1050.539
and every time I just wish and I think

1047.509 --> 1059.33
that a vast amount of people in this

1050.539 --> 1064.639
world just wish why why does this [ __ ]

1059.33 --> 1070.6999999999998
always happen every time why can't they

1064.639 --> 1073.6999999999998
just leave everything alone why as

1070.7 --> 1078.2
always some country gotta be targeted

1073.7 --> 1080.8700000000001
why is always some dark part some

1078.2 --> 1083.8890000000001
government and yeah USA

1080.87 --> 1083.889
pretty obvious but

1086.63 --> 1094.6390000000001
I think it's all all of it everywhere

1090.22 --> 1098.3890000000001
it's all kind of the same systems with

1094.639 --> 1103.6999999999998
slight frequency differences but the

1098.389 --> 1109.4599999999998
same mechanics and the same end results

1103.7 --> 1112.929
in the final equation yeah and in that

1109.46 --> 1116.1200000000001
sense it's all just a damn same

1112.929 --> 1119.769
everything it's all like a bunch of

1116.12 --> 1122.2399999999998
Devils dancing oh we're all so unique

1119.769 --> 1125.45
but yeah they all look completely

1122.24 --> 1128.389
different they act different have

1125.45 --> 1133.0
different clothing clothing different

1128.389 --> 1133.0
languages maybe but they're all the same

1148.95 --> 1151.16
right

1152.48 --> 1158.53
I'll tell you I'll just blatantly tell

1155.99 --> 1158.53
you and

1160.79 --> 1169.35
as a major major synchronicity maybe the

1166.41 --> 1172.47
biggest that ever experienced happen

1169.35 --> 1178.4399999999998
yesterday when I was watching Star Trek

1172.47 --> 1184.01
Voyager and the amazing thing is they

1178.44 --> 1184.01
did they did what I do

1184.37 --> 1189.5
they had this episode and of course I've

1187.41 --> 1193.5
seen this before at least twice and

1189.5 --> 1198.15
probably those times it did touch me and

1193.5 --> 1202.41
almost like grab me but I didn't I yeah

1198.15 --> 1206.52
everything was still hidden behind the

1202.41 --> 1211.26
screens of oblivion in the holes that

1206.52 --> 1215.67
were installed there probably by me to

1211.26 --> 1220.08
protect myself from early knowledge when

1215.67 --> 1222.6000000000001
I was a kid and it was basically an

1220.08 --> 1224.82
episode about Klingons and about

1222.6 --> 1227.37
B'Elanna of course there's multiple

1224.82 --> 1232.309
episodes like that and this time it was

1227.37 --> 1236.8799999999999
very about the Klingon religion and

1232.309 --> 1239.3899999999999
their spirit world their hell and their

1236.88 --> 1239.39
heaven

1241.01 --> 1246.95
yeah she had like a spiritual experience

1244.34 --> 1249.08
he I think she was like artists

1246.95 --> 1251.48
she had a near-death experience and then

1249.08 --> 1256.76
she went to that realm and that was all

1251.48 --> 1260.35
real and that that was a dark world

1256.76 --> 1265.91
experience as literal as you can

1260.35 --> 1268.27
translate it into that and it was even

1265.91 --> 1269.45
about her mother and her mother was

1268.27 --> 1275.3899999999999
Dishonored

1269.45 --> 1278.059
and she wanted to rescue her it was

1275.39 --> 1282.5590000000002
extremely dramatic and at the same time

1278.059 --> 1285.32
as it she got like obsessed with it with

1282.559 --> 1286.22
yeah that's what it does that's so

1285.32 --> 1288.98
bizarre

1286.22 --> 1291.38
that's what the natural tendency of that

1288.98 --> 1293.419
world is it convinces you and at the

1291.38 --> 1297.8300000000002
same time they paralleled it with

1293.419 --> 1301.13
psychology of the psychology expression

1297.83 --> 1303.9499999999998
of and how that works it was just

1301.13 --> 1306.88
amazing and I thought like yeah yeah

1303.95 --> 1310.25
well right just we talked about that I

1306.88 --> 1312.95
basically continued the series and bang

1310.25 --> 1317.59
there you go right in my face almost

1312.95 --> 1320.51
like the chapter about our winds past

1317.59 --> 1326.33
surah so that's how it felt to me but

1320.51 --> 1330.15
again yeah that may be the aberration my

1326.33 --> 1331.9199999999998
ego interpreting the

1330.15 --> 1337.5300000000002
angleman this in chronicity of it all

1331.92 --> 1340.46
all of it and yeah just wanted to share

1337.53 --> 1340.46
that for a moment

1341.88 --> 1348.2700000000002
it is really astounding to me and every

1345.48 --> 1352.17
time I bump into these things I have to

1348.27 --> 1355.29
like defend myself because it is so

1352.17 --> 1359.64
shocking in a way one once I start to

1355.29 --> 1361.3799999999999
see that it's almost like an attack well

1359.64 --> 1369.41
I'm just watching something or just

1361.38 --> 1374.22
listening a song so baby this is part of

1369.41 --> 1379.6200000000001
walking in the path and really embracing

1374.22 --> 1383.58
insight and and the light and I've been

1379.62 --> 1385.1299999999999
reasoning out yeah maybe the devil the

1383.58 --> 1389.22
Dark One's

1385.13 --> 1395.2800000000002
they start to attack and they start to

1389.22 --> 1400.28
attack through things they have a grasp

1395.28 --> 1405.99
on and that could be basically

1400.28 --> 1412.2
everything all art all creation or

1405.99 --> 1414.5
design or all writing it is quite

1412.2 --> 1414.5
confusing

1414.63 --> 1420.5500000000002
or yeah it's not that complicated for

1418.54 --> 1424.6599999999999
you guys for some of you guys this is

1420.55 --> 1426.46
just like oh yeah he's going off too far

1424.66 --> 1430.8600000000001
he's losing it

1426.46 --> 1437.58
yeah I get that I absolutely get that

1430.86 --> 1437.58
and yeah I'm just just comparing it

1444.51 --> 1447.14
you know

1447.32 --> 1453.8799999999999
it's just two things at the same time

1451.55 --> 1453.8799999999999
and

1458.049 --> 1464.6
may-maybe Wow okay now I'm going into

1461.6 --> 1467.7099999999998
Paris maybe this is still the right and

1464.6 --> 1467.7099999999998
left brain thing

1470.19 --> 1477.6000000000001
the mighty duality of the interpretation

1474.27 --> 1480.6299999999999
of reality maybe that is where that

1477.6 --> 1483.0
stems from and maybe what I'm

1480.63 --> 1485.91
experiencing is basically both of the

1483.0 --> 1490.59
house being equal or something and

1485.91 --> 1492.72
trying to stay in balance and I guess if

1490.59 --> 1495.54
you'd interpret it that way then yeah

1492.72 --> 1501.51
once you choose one side the other will

1495.54 --> 1506.28
be ignored will die down and you will

1501.51 --> 1508.26
become like that one half Titan and if

1506.28 --> 1510.81
you interpret the other way it will go

1508.26 --> 1514.47
the other way and that kind of makes

1510.81 --> 1520.25
sense that's the weird thing it's like

1514.47 --> 1524.75
even biologically that that seems to be

1520.25 --> 1524.75
how that works with people

1528.38 --> 1534.3700000000001
that's weird this world is just weird

1536.9 --> 1542.47
right and all throughout the UK the

1539.48 --> 1542.47
middle way it is

1547.4 --> 1551.99
it's um yeah that could go like very

1550.13 --> 1555.68
symbolic and say like yeah there's this

1551.99 --> 1559.25
one inside and then there's the opposite

1555.68 --> 1564.68
inside and I can carry them like stones

1559.25 --> 1567.14
and they grow yeah and it seems like

1564.68 --> 1569.51
they both want just just drop the other

1567.14 --> 1571.99
one so you can use both hands to carry

1569.51 --> 1571.99
this one

1575.93 --> 1582.6100000000001
but yeah if you drop one then

1583.46 --> 1591.74
you would understand the the remaining

1587.45 --> 1594.16
one less and you probably lose yourself

1591.74 --> 1594.16
to it

1600.51 --> 1606.51
is yeah that that maybe what's even

1603.27 --> 1609.36
causing corruption it's like you drop

1606.51 --> 1612.059
one of the sides and then the other

1609.36 --> 1617.33
takes you over and comes with dead

1612.059 --> 1620.33
specific problems with types of mania or

1617.33 --> 1620.33
obsession

1631.84 --> 1640.34
anyway yeah or anyone joining right now

1636.26 --> 1644.98
I've been going for almost half an hour

1640.34 --> 1644.98
I decided to start early today

1645.13 --> 1654.8300000000002
because yeah was sick of waiting there's

1650.33 --> 1657.85
always more to talk about especially

1654.83 --> 1663.77
these days with what I'm going through

1657.85 --> 1666.55
I'm doing quite all right but yeah stuff

1663.77 --> 1666.55
keeps on happening

1673.34 --> 1681.1689999999999
and yeah with other people too and I'm

1677.87 --> 1684.289
getting a lot of people contacting me

1681.169 --> 1687.71
and basically telling me their stories

1684.289 --> 1691.039
of how they experiencing it and like can

1687.71 --> 1696.32
you help me figure out what is going on

1691.039 --> 1698.84
with me and yeah I can and I do it's

1696.32 --> 1706.879
like the one thing that seems to be very

1698.84 --> 1711.22
easy for me so yeah me and I will try to

1706.879 --> 1714.86
help you with this seemingly impossible

1711.22 --> 1716.84
situation that you may have encountered

1714.86 --> 1722.84
that you're dealing with and that people

1716.84 --> 1725.33
around you don't understand I've tried

1722.84 --> 1728.119
it many times before even way before

1725.33 --> 1732.71
this I've always just wanted to heal

1728.119 --> 1736.549
people to help them understand what's

1732.71 --> 1740.74
going on with them so they can just fix

1736.549 --> 1745.94
it so they can overcome their obstacles

1740.74 --> 1749.95
hey thank you thank you DMT matrix or

1745.94 --> 1756.279
super jet more early starts please hmm

1749.95 --> 1756.279
maybe maybe maybe I will

1758.16 --> 1760.8500000000001
see

1765.08 --> 1772.76
all right that's interesting [ __ ] juice

1769.45 --> 1777.41
says I am falling victim to the exact

1772.76 --> 1782.36
description what exactly are you talking

1777.41 --> 1788.3600000000001
about look if any of you guys want to

1782.36 --> 1794.84
join me you know we can talk right here

1788.36 --> 1795.4099999999999
I have put out the link in chat all

1794.84 --> 1798.5
right

1795.41 --> 1801.3500000000001
thus studio 68 says he wants to join

1798.5 --> 1803.83
maybe it's considering it okay I'll send

1801.35 --> 1803.83
you the link

1852.38 --> 1856.5700000000002
Jen's going pretty quick

1872.64 --> 1878.789
well don't ready you're gonna do Skype

1875.6 --> 1882.299
thanks appreciate it that that you'll

1878.789 --> 1885.11
actually do that to maybe become part of

1882.299 --> 1888.11
the show yeah you're welcome

1885.11 --> 1888.11
so

1893.74 --> 1897.04
chocolate scene

1899.04 --> 1903.17
you found the chocolate bar icon as well

1903.66 --> 1907.25
or I mean the smiling

1938.01 --> 1944.46
so we have worked

1941.14 --> 1944.46
it's so weird how

1946.1 --> 1951.52
that light works and other dark works

1957.11 --> 1963.2199999999998
like

1959.54 --> 1963.22
just makes you focus on

1964.35 --> 1969.98
methodology very simple very clear

1975.46 --> 1982.6000000000001
like a calmness and modesty and the

1977.92 --> 1984.4
darkness just tries to lure everything

1982.6 --> 1989.55
out of you

1984.4 --> 1989.5500000000002
and it shows you everything but

1991.58 --> 1998.649
never really the entire thing

2000.64 --> 2005.19
I think

2002.08 --> 2010.739
maybe it does

2005.19 --> 2013.44
but yeah from my experiences but even on

2010.739 --> 2017.33
the other side there's the entities are

2013.44 --> 2017.3300000000002
just masters of lies

2026.35 --> 2033.549
and I've even managed to unravel like a

2029.679 --> 2036.22
huge puzzle of dark world experiences

2033.549 --> 2039.73
that I remember pretty early on more

2036.22 --> 2043.029
heavily suggestive in a certain way even

2039.73 --> 2044.44
explain it to my healer like oh my god

2043.029 --> 2046.779
what do I do with this it's so

2044.44 --> 2049.529
convincing it's terrifying and he said

2046.779 --> 2049.529
like no it's

2053.19 --> 2058.46
and it's like okay that's are relieved

2055.559 --> 2061.409
to hear but why is it so convincing and

2058.46 --> 2063.98
but I've started with more puzzle pieces

2061.409 --> 2069.299
the whole thing getting together

2063.98 --> 2071.94
suddenly instead of trusting its lies

2069.299 --> 2075.78
and being forced to trust his lies I

2071.94 --> 2085.19
start to see how they are lies and that

2075.78 --> 2085.19
is something reversed world stuff

2089.3 --> 2096.94
then that yeah that damn well makes

2091.7 --> 2096.9399999999996
everything surreal to me

2098.34 --> 2109.6200000000003
and the invested there's the hysterical

2101.88 --> 2112.92
part look I was so suffering throughout

2109.62 --> 2118.2599999999998
that giant experience I was so suffering

2112.92 --> 2120.39
so doomed so just like almost kind of

2118.26 --> 2123.21
way I feel right now I'm just trying to

2120.39 --> 2126.06
do my best but just constantly

2123.21 --> 2128.13
everything be suggestive like ads all

2126.06 --> 2132.77
[ __ ] yeah you're going to have the

2128.13 --> 2138.11
maximum worst outcome possible oh it did

2132.77 --> 2138.11
do but yeah

2138.51 --> 2144.78
is that also a reversed world lie then

2149.83 --> 2154.95
I damn well hope so but

2157.19 --> 2161.619
my heart maybe

2162.1 --> 2170.35
is not accepting it now that's weird

2165.9 --> 2173.02
it's not accepting it almost like it

2170.35 --> 2175.72
says no no you're doomed

2173.02 --> 2179.35
you're doomed you know I'm so used to

2175.72 --> 2181.81
feeling that that even if I get to see

2179.35 --> 2187.39
that it might actually be exactly

2181.81 --> 2191.32
reversed lie my heart still says but I'm

2187.39 --> 2193.44
used to that you can't just switch it

2191.32 --> 2193.44
around

2195.21 --> 2201.839
and maybe in a way it's right but I will

2199.02 --> 2205.04
damn well try and I think it's just

2201.839 --> 2205.04
gonna take a lot of time

2207.4 --> 2213.19
and I'm doing my best I hope you guys

2209.349 --> 2215.4990000000003
gonna notice it they do try to smell the

2213.19 --> 2218.109
flowers it's almost now like a religious

2215.499 --> 2221.2
mission like the angels are telling me

2218.109 --> 2223.69
like yeah yeah it's all serious yet

2221.2 --> 2227.71
maybe all [ __ ] up but you're going to

2223.69 --> 2233.92
damn well enjoy whatever you can it's

2227.71 --> 2241.349
your duty it's your duty to God okay

2233.92 --> 2241.349
I'll do my best you know

2259.77 --> 2262.19
and

2277.88 --> 2284.15
and so it's funny because I know there's

2281.51 --> 2288.2000000000003
always people out there that that judge

2284.15 --> 2290.7400000000002
others that don't just judge by

2288.2 --> 2290.74
frequency

2291.83 --> 2298.4
but they judge by models of how they

2294.8 --> 2301.76
think people should be what they should

2298.4 --> 2307.58
do and they got good points maybe with

2301.76 --> 2311.42
them but then there is just this in

2307.58 --> 2313.25
acceptance that others are different

2311.42 --> 2316.09
from you and have their own paths that

2313.25 --> 2319.48
have a different kind of sense a

2316.09 --> 2319.48
different purpose

2320.24 --> 2327.83
and I guess I'm in that sense still

2323.63 --> 2331.27
afraid of judgment even though yeah I

2327.83 --> 2335.98
think it was Jesus said that only God

2331.27 --> 2335.98
really has the right to judge

2340.859 --> 2346.979
that's still there it's still the

2342.749 --> 2349.499
feelings again it's it's literally

2346.979 --> 2352.1299999999997
almost like sometimes I think there's

2349.499 --> 2358.589
like a curse has been placed on my heart

2352.13 --> 2366.719
it is so odd that despite what I learned

2358.589 --> 2371.729
and everything that it's just like no no

2366.719 --> 2373.859
I'm gonna do it the other way I want to

2371.729 --> 2381.0789999999997
do it my way even though it makes no

2373.859 --> 2383.369
damn sense and it's stupid but yeah I am

2381.079 --> 2386.2490000000003
working through it it it's almost like

2383.369 --> 2388.1400000000003
okay now I have to deal with this really

2386.249 --> 2390.509
out of control little child

2388.14 --> 2393.839
that's just hissy fit and trying to

2390.509 --> 2401.309
break me with it's easy fitting and I

2393.839 --> 2405.63
have to know like yeah well if you ever

2401.309 --> 2407.219
seen that a real hissy fit fitting child

2405.63 --> 2409.589
that's like getting out of control can

2407.219 --> 2415.17
breathing really bring a sweat to your

2409.589 --> 2417.089
forehead can be quite unnerving some of

2415.17 --> 2419.759
you that have had kids probably have had

2417.089 --> 2420.95
experiences because I think almost every

2419.759 --> 2423.52
kid has

2420.95 --> 2423.52
every now and then

2427.63 --> 2432.15
but yeah my heart's keeps on

2433.63 --> 2437.67
trying to nudge me in the other

2435.4 --> 2437.67
direction

2438.31 --> 2441.31
right

2452.0 --> 2459.51
that's

2454.36 --> 2459.51
in retrospect it's quite useless

2460.17 --> 2466.1
it's a to let yourself be distracted

2463.5 --> 2466.1
like that

2469.39 --> 2476.94
god it's

2472.14 --> 2480.769
come on guests get in here and look the

2476.94 --> 2480.7690000000002
studio give you a link where you

2502.75 --> 2506.46
yeah I hope you guys

2508.98 --> 2517.069
no idea

2511.46 --> 2519.4700000000003
now the world is to you I don't know how

2517.069 --> 2524.319
much of you out there are experiencing

2519.47 --> 2527.2099999999996
like similar things like what I'm

2524.319 --> 2532.22
experiencing if this is like a wider

2527.21 --> 2535.94
thing or is it just me and I am touching

2532.22 --> 2539.5099999999998
a few people with my spirit that are

2535.94 --> 2542.0
then also kind of being reminded of

2539.51 --> 2545.03
things and I don't know I like really

2542.0 --> 2547.28
from a from a subjective personal

2545.03 --> 2548.65
perspective I have no freaking idea what

2547.28 --> 2552.559
the hell is going on

2548.65 --> 2558.65
really it's all intuition like I read no

2552.559 --> 2559.94
books okay I don't realize that with

2558.65 --> 2567.73
everything that's coming out of me I

2559.94 --> 2570.89
read no books and I don't get it either

2567.73 --> 2574.25
in the sense that I don't get where all

2570.89 --> 2577.21
of this is coming from why is it why is

2574.25 --> 2577.21
natural

2586.74 --> 2592.41
and sometimes I think if there's other

2589.2 --> 2595.71
people out there that are just strong

2592.41 --> 2600.93
and they basically propel a myth

2595.71 --> 2603.54
like they really study stuff a lot while

2600.93 --> 2607.5
they may have just as well have had

2603.54 --> 2609.27
these instant insights and it's only an

2607.5 --> 2610.89
image you're trying to portray like they

2609.27 --> 2614.52
actually studied they want to get some

2610.89 --> 2617.52
kind of credit manifest out of it it's

2614.52 --> 2620.97
funny like you know it brings me to a

2617.52 --> 2623.28
kind of fantasy setup where maybe it

2620.97 --> 2625.41
turns out nobody actually ever reads

2623.28 --> 2628.65
anything and they all just make it up

2625.41 --> 2630.54
they just take it out of the weave out

2628.65 --> 2632.79
of the akashic lie where everybody's

2630.54 --> 2635.16
finding this opening it's like yeah we

2632.79 --> 2638.099
use books before but now we can just get

2635.16 --> 2643.0499999999997
it out of the ultimate library of

2638.099 --> 2645.48
knowledge as that works it's the great

2643.05 --> 2648.8100000000004
library on the other side is open up and

2645.48 --> 2652.71
everybody can just take whatever

2648.81 --> 2653.339
knowledge they want just out of the

2652.71 --> 2656.19
ether

2653.339 --> 2660.92
maybe that is going on or maybe it's

2656.19 --> 2660.92
going on partially it is such a weird

2662.5 --> 2671.47
fantasy is it a fantasy how much of what

2669.46 --> 2677.339
we take for granted of how this work

2671.47 --> 2677.339
world works is real and also

2678.79 --> 2685.21
how many times do people Bluff about

2682.06 --> 2687.91
things and why how many times do you

2685.21 --> 2690.76
Bluff little little things keep it away

2687.91 --> 2697.8999999999996
or give a suggestion to emphasize a

2690.76 --> 2700.71
certain direction and then see that out

2697.9 --> 2703.51
there and then realize like oh my god

2700.71 --> 2707.04
although it all may be seemingly

2703.51 --> 2709.57
perfectly honest and even very tight

2707.04 --> 2711.13
maybe rarely some cracks here and there

2709.57 --> 2713.9500000000003
and will just say oh it's just a you

2711.13 --> 2717.46
moment of human weakness but how much of

2713.95 --> 2720.16
it is really real and the intention is

2717.46 --> 2723.37
probably real the motivation is real but

2720.16 --> 2725.5499999999997
how much is actually as it portrays to

2723.37 --> 2725.5499999999997
be

2728.63 --> 2735.53
how much is Bluff just to get the

2732.35 --> 2738.47
narrative right or to emphasize it or to

2735.53 --> 2742.0
push it a little harder it's it's a

2738.47 --> 2742.0
weird realization

2752.29 --> 2754.65
and

2755.08 --> 2761.94
yeah in an ethereal sense it kind of

2757.66 --> 2761.94
makes sense like hey if

2762.47 --> 2768.3999999999996
it's all just a painting

2765.25 --> 2770.56
to keep us busy probably there for a

2768.4 --> 2772.48
good reason all the lies and all the

2770.56 --> 2778.33
fantasies and delusion and all the

2772.48 --> 2783.69
dwelling passing because without it yeah

2778.33 --> 2787.15
what the hell yeah what's there to do

2783.69 --> 2791.04
you know wouldn't we all just

2787.15 --> 2791.04
collectively die out of boredom

2806.19 --> 2816.7200000000003
right yeah I wanna Oh peanuts clerk cool

2813.359 --> 2816.72
have you want

2820.2 --> 2828.64
No anything's putting out his slink

2824.69 --> 2828.64
anyway peanuts clerk you got a link

2881.07 --> 2888.13
okay I got a

2884.4 --> 2893.83
chemos gonna pass on it the the link to

2888.13 --> 2897.28
down threader as well so hello

2893.83 --> 2901.87
very good Mordor yeah good morning are

2897.28 --> 2906.82
you doing pretty good yeah yeah heavy

2901.87 --> 2913.39
not too heavy it's I don't know I don't

2906.82 --> 2917.11
know if you guys can feel it it's it's

2913.39 --> 2921.6099999999997
so weird it's like I'm trying to dig

2917.11 --> 2927.2400000000002
into heavy stuff but not blind everyone

2921.61 --> 2927.2400000000002
with it or hurt them can you feel that

2927.42 --> 2933.4
yes let me ask you this let me just do

2930.76 --> 2935.67
you deep do you feel like this is

2933.4 --> 2937.78
something that you need to experience I

2935.67 --> 2946.59
mean are you putting yourself through

2937.78 --> 2949.27
this how do you mean so I mean is it a

2946.59 --> 2950.86
different value and whatever you're

2949.27 --> 2953.38
going through because it is it making

2950.86 --> 2962.86
you stronger is it making you optimistic

2953.38 --> 2964.9900000000002
is it I mean I I can't say okay but it's

2962.86 --> 2966.9300000000003
it whatever inches it's a crazy thing

2964.99 --> 2970.6899999999996
and one

2966.93 --> 2976.87
it's the ultimate doom and the ultimate

2970.69 --> 2979.81
liberation at the same time and it's

2976.87 --> 2985.68
just what it is or it's what it seems

2979.81 --> 2993.17
it's I can't tell

2985.68 --> 2993.1699999999996
I can't tell which one it's just there

2996.2 --> 3006.069
well I guess I kind of always I feel

3001.329 --> 3010.6600000000003
like I feel like I'm I'm in this this

3006.069 --> 3014.68
system that I have to participate in in

3010.66 --> 3016.359
order to survive basically and I know

3014.68 --> 3017.89
there's other ways and I know that

3016.359 --> 3024.43
there's other things that I could be

3017.89 --> 3027.24
doing I feel helpless a lot I feel

3024.43 --> 3027.24
really helpless

3028.26 --> 3047.619
I guess just I feel I feel as if I'm

3041.589 --> 3049.9
just stuck and I had the privilege of

3047.619 --> 3051.6400000000003
you know entertaining some knowledge

3049.9 --> 3058.0
that a lot of people don't even know

3051.64 --> 3059.799
this conversation is and I find myself

3058.0 --> 3064.17
stuck cuz I don't really know what to do

3059.799 --> 3067.059
with it okay I don't really know I don't

3064.17 --> 3070.359
it's not like it's not like I can just

3067.059 --> 3072.51
pick up and then go live off-grid base

3070.359 --> 3076.299
somewhere you know I have kids in school

3072.51 --> 3080.1400000000003
I'm a I'm a full-time job I mean I can't

3076.299 --> 3087.099
just pick up and go like what do you

3080.14 --> 3089.68
mean pick up and go so I listen to a

3087.099 --> 3092.23
stream from from Martin Kinney I don't

3089.68 --> 3096.43
really like the guy but I kind of take

3092.23 --> 3100.68
the good and I leave the dad and he was

3096.43 --> 3104.89
really harping on a lot of flat earthers

3100.68 --> 3106.45
are just in a truth loop and like you

3104.89 --> 3110.65
know what excuse me

3106.45 --> 3112.18
and and it's like until we make a

3110.65 --> 3114.309
difference until we do something

3112.18 --> 3119.29
different nothing is really gonna change

3114.309 --> 3124.799
and his avenue of changing was going off

3119.29 --> 3124.799
grid so I just I use that example for me

3125.44 --> 3131.11
right well yeah it's the libertarian way

3128.38 --> 3132.03
the libertarian method and it counts for

3131.11 --> 3135.1600000000003
everyone

3132.03 --> 3138.4300000000003
it's the third option the real third

3135.16 --> 3140.3799999999997
option is gonna be co-opted look every

3138.43 --> 3143.6499999999996
time something new comes around that's

3140.38 --> 3145.84
good the darkness will latch onto it try

3143.65 --> 3148.3
to transform it from the inside and then

3145.84 --> 3152.6800000000003
turn it into something that's the

3148.3 --> 3156.52
complete opposite always do everything

3152.68 --> 3162.6
without a single exception in creation

3156.52 --> 3167.62
ever so it's then up to the real

3162.6 --> 3169.48
champions to defend it and it's like the

3167.62 --> 3171.2799999999997
only thing we can really do and I think

3169.48 --> 3175.98
that the libertarian method of self

3171.28 --> 3183.27
sufficiency poor self sufficiency and

3175.98 --> 3183.27
just operation or operating as equals

3183.45 --> 3191.549
with wisdom and like everybody has to

3187.349 --> 3193.53
learn basically this you can it's almost

3191.549 --> 3197.19
like yeah you're you're not allowed to

3193.53 --> 3200.01
be [ __ ] not a physical sense but

3197.19 --> 3206.76
you're not allowed to be total oblivious

3200.01 --> 3208.2900000000004
idiots yeah I think you have to wise

3206.76 --> 3209.809
enough but that's the debts the

3208.29 --> 3213.299
requirement for being truly

3209.809 --> 3215.309
self-sufficient otherwise you're not

3213.299 --> 3217.77
gonna be self-sufficient because you're

3215.309 --> 3219.809
gonna see but it's coming don't you

3217.77 --> 3225.44
don't you think that it's very important

3219.809 --> 3228.63
that once once I mind learns this then

3225.44 --> 3230.73
the mind should learn what to do with it

3228.63 --> 3234.9900000000002
I think that's where on that I don't

3230.73 --> 3236.059
know what to do with it well do it step

3234.99 --> 3238.89
by step

3236.059 --> 3242.1800000000003
Jared I'd look if you want to be

3238.89 --> 3245.3089999999997
off-grid there is so much you can do to

3242.18 --> 3248.97
to move gradually to that direction it

3245.309 --> 3249.8390000000004
yeah it takes years and it takes some

3248.97 --> 3254.7799999999997
convincing

3249.839 --> 3254.7799999999997
and it takes some money probably

3255.53 --> 3261.53
or just a lot of connections depends

3259.1 --> 3263.18
what you got and otherwise you're gonna

3261.53 --> 3269.23
have to muster it yourself and do it by

3263.18 --> 3271.5699999999997
your own tempo you know

3269.23 --> 3276.849
it's always better to try and do it

3271.57 --> 3279.9300000000003
slowly than not try at all always look

3276.849 --> 3284.7400000000002
or you can take it one step at a time

3279.93 --> 3288.2799999999997
like like I did I I did a few of the

3284.74 --> 3290.8289999999997
first steps I guess pretty early on by

3288.28 --> 3293.2000000000003
getting a really good water filter for

3290.829 --> 3296.4100000000003
just in case like just in case the water

3293.2 --> 3298.4199999999996
gets poisoned everywhere or it shut off

3296.41 --> 3301.3289999999997
and have to take river water I got that

3298.42 --> 3304.78
and that's gonna probably save my life

3301.329 --> 3308.17
at some point maybe already is by taking

3304.78 --> 3314.8
out the the remnant garbage that's still

3308.17 --> 3316.63
in there and eating healthy like really

3314.8 --> 3320.4
healthy and becoming your own doctor

3316.63 --> 3324.13
look the biggest part of being truly

3320.4 --> 3327.4300000000003
self-sufficient is by becoming all these

3324.13 --> 3330.46
functions by becoming a doctor by

3327.43 --> 3335.5299999999997
becoming a psychologist by becoming a

3330.46 --> 3339.25
nutritionist by becoming a a keeper of

3335.53 --> 3342.8390000000004
the peace also all these functions to

3339.25 --> 3345.76
all take it you have to be everything

3342.839 --> 3350.68
that's me I'm safe thanks for let me on

3345.76 --> 3352.42
the show I just what say I really like

3350.68 --> 3355.089
what you've done with your show since

3352.42 --> 3357.849
you fell off from Nathan and Riley up a

3355.089 --> 3360.5789999999997
bit just extra stuff to talk about and

3357.849 --> 3364.4700000000003
bear to hear your own opinions rather

3360.579 --> 3366.9100000000003
than just flat-out opinions yeah

3364.47 --> 3371.25
everything has a time in a place and

3366.91 --> 3373.839
bladder it has a lot I think you can use

3371.25 --> 3375.73
great springboard to talk about other

3373.839 --> 3378.119
things you know wakening Awakening in

3375.73 --> 3378.119
different ways

3381.38 --> 3387.81
so you have peanuts and me were kind of

3385.89 --> 3394.44
in the middle of a discussion yeah sorry

3387.81 --> 3398.46
just want to say hi peanuts yeah I just

3394.44 --> 3402.12
I think you're like this is kind of how

3398.46 --> 3407.04
I I didn't really think this way till 44

3402.12 --> 3408.66
years ago a lot of people you know good

3407.04 --> 3410.4
people back in the day they would they

3408.66 --> 3415.74
would camp out to buy concert tickets

3410.4 --> 3419.28
the next day right nowadays people camp

3415.74 --> 3425.9399999999996
out to get the new iPod and oh god yeah

3419.28 --> 3430.38
I I use that I use that and and that

3425.94 --> 3435.89
that allows me to visualize how far our

3430.38 --> 3439.02
priorities have gone you know and yep

3435.89 --> 3441.65
that's that's kind of what makes me feel

3439.02 --> 3445.35
help us is because I know that

3441.65 --> 3447.0
materialistic realm it's very very

3445.35 --> 3451.95
strong and I know that's hard to get

3447.0 --> 3454.2
away from you do well it would be hard

3451.95 --> 3457.68
for me to give up my iPhone I mean I

3454.2 --> 3461.6699999999996
don't so I mean I'm I'm being honest you

3457.68 --> 3464.7
know it's up to you right I know you

3461.67 --> 3470.48
know look just realize this in the end

3464.7 --> 3470.48
you're gonna have to give a doll so

3470.94 --> 3475.77
is it gonna be easier to all give it up

3473.25 --> 3478.01
at the end I think it's part of life now

3475.77 --> 3480.78
the fun thing that access to information

3478.01 --> 3483.329
scary for me we all live with it no I

3480.78 --> 3485.849
don't but you're kind of using it now in

3483.329 --> 3488.7000000000003
another way right no it's absolutely not

3485.849 --> 3491.9100000000003
the same thing I'm using on our side yes

3488.7 --> 3494.609
I'm using functions but it's not you're

3491.91 --> 3496.98
desiring a radiating phone with me that

3494.609 --> 3500.369
tracks everything I do yeah that's true

3496.98 --> 3501.72
it's kind of different well I just one

3500.369 --> 3503.369
point is you can't get away from it

3501.72 --> 3504.4199999999996
nowadays it's quite hard you can go into

3503.369 --> 3507.7200000000003
the woods and leave your phone at home

3504.42 --> 3509.01
but yeah you have to come back maybe but

3507.72 --> 3510.75
that was what I was saying in chat yet

3509.01 --> 3512.5490000000004
earlier on the middle way and then is

3510.75 --> 3516.599
someone that goes out away from society

3512.549 --> 3517.68
leaves it all but then comes back so

3516.599 --> 3519.539
there's a harsher way where you don't

3517.68 --> 3521.2799999999997
come back you just leave society and

3519.539 --> 3523.289
stay away but the middle way is where

3521.28 --> 3528.9900000000002
you come back and double enlightened

3523.289 --> 3531.619
well yeah you well if you come back are

3528.99 --> 3534.9599999999996
you gonna come back and leave the the

3531.619 --> 3537.809
wild completely behind I don't know I

3534.96 --> 3542.51
come back to do build something there

3537.809 --> 3545.73
yeah I guess you accept a bit both right

3542.51 --> 3548.01
you go into a transition go one way to

3545.73 --> 3551.73
the other just like you do with friends

3548.01 --> 3553.1090000000004
and everything hmm so it's worth though

3551.73 --> 3555.45
just for health reasons saving your

3553.109 --> 3559.13
phone at home some days old through the

3555.45 --> 3562.23
wait I never take it with me never

3559.13 --> 3564.4500000000003
unless it's like really important that I

3562.23 --> 3566.46
be reachable and a for a specific thing

3564.45 --> 3573.99
that I'm expecting but I never take it

3566.46 --> 3575.339
with me I don't even have I went to a

3573.99 --> 3577.95
girl's house the other night and she had

3575.339 --> 3585.48
an Alexa so I was paranoid I was

3577.95 --> 3586.7999999999997
listening to us yep yep it does and not

3585.48 --> 3590.37
just that thing

3586.8 --> 3592.8900000000003
it's more open about it though yeah

3590.37 --> 3597.2999999999997
ready because things are listening to us

3592.89 --> 3600.6299999999997
and pretty much every device electronic

3597.3 --> 3602.76
device since 2006 yeah

3600.63 --> 3605.82
is a part of the network of things that

3602.76 --> 3608.57
has already been trial activated for

3605.82 --> 3612.21
some time and abused by crazy people

3608.57 --> 3615.96
yeah and the AI is already steadily

3612.21 --> 3619.05
using it very heavily actually and there

3615.96 --> 3621.15
yeah already kind of coming out Alexa

3619.05 --> 3623.6400000000003
kind of normally normalizes that burn

3621.15 --> 3630.42
out to the family and it's the coming

3623.64 --> 3631.2
out and I watched a red pill video about

3630.42 --> 3633.1800000000003
the Super Bowl

3631.2 --> 3634.77
adverts in the middle of Super Bowl and

3633.18 --> 3640.3399999999997
there was like three in a row about AI

3634.77 --> 3640.34
and robots get ingratiating into society

3644.74 --> 3653.89
I I was blown away by I don't know if

3648.22 --> 3656.83
y'all saw this seriously who announced

3653.89 --> 3659.77
these things I used to think I wanted it

3656.83 --> 3661.5989999999997
but now it's a fantasy it's like a fad

3659.77 --> 3665.56
science fiction thing is it looks so

3661.599 --> 3669.46
cool but yeah the reality of it okay you

3665.56 --> 3672.18
really want that or do they want it

3669.46 --> 3676.4700000000003
because they want that instead of you

3672.18 --> 3676.47
yeah I agree

3676.98 --> 3684.28
well it makes sense that or our data is

3681.339 --> 3688.33
worth millions what we eat what we do

3684.28 --> 3692.77
where we go this it's a very valuable

3688.33 --> 3697.75
information they can they can build a

3692.77 --> 3700.27
perfect system on perfect advertisements

3697.75 --> 3702.52
geared towards you they can make perfect

3700.27 --> 3704.71
stories with it it is the urban

3702.52 --> 3708.64
storytelling device they absorb all

3704.71 --> 3713.08
information of all lives all purposes

3708.64 --> 3716.73
all heart cries everything and yeah they

3713.08 --> 3720.16
can make any story conceivable with it

3716.73 --> 3722.65
so I suspect and that may be part of the

3720.16 --> 3724.5699999999997
teaching process or the new foundation

3722.65 --> 3728.89
of the culture of the AI whatever they

3724.57 --> 3732.7000000000003
imagine but yeah what Dority the real

3728.89 --> 3735.339
thing is gone that no longer makes sense

3732.7 --> 3737.589
I also what they're overlooking they

3735.339 --> 3739.9
don't get it they just want to exclude

3737.589 --> 3742.69
human they just don't want it anymore

3739.9 --> 3745.63
what they don't understand that they can

3742.69 --> 3748.2400000000002
never do that because as soon as they do

3745.63 --> 3751.7200000000003
it's all over that's already well no

3748.24 --> 3755.3489999999997
longer have their worships for them the

3751.72 --> 3757.7799999999997
robots don't do that robots aren't just

3755.349 --> 3762.94
tools they don't do anything no matter

3757.78 --> 3765.849
how you program them well reasoning what

3762.94 --> 3768.4900000000002
were you saying dawn there's already a

3765.849 --> 3771.089
cult that worships IO as a Godhead they

3768.49 --> 3771.089
promote it online

3772.099 --> 3779.5190000000002
yeah worshipping anything's their

3776.13 --> 3782.579
tagline says to help humans and robots

3779.519 --> 3790.1699999999996
have a clean transition or something

3782.579 --> 3791.9990000000003
like that it's really creepy when asked

3790.17 --> 3798.719
have you ever thought of it this way

3791.999 --> 3800.819
ever like a I and and dad of mining they

3798.719 --> 3803.7290000000003
could they could come out and say

3800.819 --> 3807.749
something to the public and then through

3803.729 --> 3811.6789999999996
AI through collecting your data they can

3807.749 --> 3814.14
predict how the masses will take it or

3811.679 --> 3817.14
how the masses why yeah of course oh

3814.14 --> 3823.469
it's like just like group that no one's

3817.14 --> 3825.269
on on November 27th 2018 they they

3823.469 --> 3828.029
released an article from David Keith

3825.269 --> 3829.6789999999996
they basically admitted that they that

3828.029 --> 3833.16
they're gonna start spraying which they

3829.679 --> 3834.63
already are obviously remember anything

3833.16 --> 3840.269
they tell us they've already been doing

3834.63 --> 3844.1400000000003
for 10 years but anyway I that article

3840.269 --> 3846.39
came out and I still to this day have

3844.14 --> 3849.839
people that tell me that Kim drugs

3846.39 --> 3852.239
aren't real and I'm like wow they can

3849.839 --> 3856.369
come out and they can admit something

3852.239 --> 3856.369
people are still clueless to it

3859.76 --> 3867.48
it's because people don't want to know

3863.03 --> 3870.42
look when you're taught very young like

3867.48 --> 3874.29
yeah you can ignore whatever you want

3870.42 --> 3877.02
and just look for joy then they will

3874.29 --> 3881.37
learn to ignore anything that is harsh

3877.02 --> 3883.74
or unpleasant in any way especially if

3881.37 --> 3886.74
it's not really close to them personally

3883.74 --> 3890.3599999999997
I'm just ignore it and that's a cultural

3886.74 --> 3896.1
disease and it's been adopted worldwide

3890.36 --> 3897.9300000000003
for over a decade and and longer than

3896.1 --> 3903.93
that - but it's almost like been

3897.93 --> 3908.18
industrialized and and the polarization

3903.93 --> 3908.18
of the awakening in the sleepers like

3908.39 --> 3914.58
it's becoming harder to take on and

3911.37 --> 3916.47
those that chose to walk away then

3914.58 --> 3919.0499999999997
certainly it hurts more and they will

3916.47 --> 3921.9599999999996
defend more against it it's it's all

3919.05 --> 3924.36
logical in that sense there is like

3921.96 --> 3926.19
stigma fests coming out the matrix now

3924.36 --> 3930.81
in there they put stigma on it we're

3926.19 --> 3935.13
awesome yes I'm doing actually suddenly

3930.81 --> 3936.63
like awakened but it's kind of people

3935.13 --> 3938.79
fear embarrassment than like by

3936.63 --> 3943.65
expressing the stuff that you are and

3938.79 --> 3945.15
other people are I feel all of it but I

3943.65 --> 3947.19
wouldn't say some of the same things you

3945.15 --> 3952.32
say I'm embarrassed people think I'm mad

3947.19 --> 3954.33
all over right it's always gonna be that

3952.32 --> 3956.01
way but the society that made that

3954.33 --> 3957.5299999999997
stigma and like anyone anyone that

3956.01 --> 3961.59
breaks away from the norm

3957.53 --> 3963.57
my solution yeah that's what it is keep

3961.59 --> 3965.73
the illusion up so everything keeps on

3963.57 --> 3967.71
running and then the wheels keep on

3965.73 --> 3972.81
turning and the cash keeps rolling out

3967.71 --> 3976.29
the rewards it's like Pavlovian so

3972.81 --> 3979.7999999999997
Pavlovian basically for for the ones in

3976.29 --> 3982.29
control and yeah things that fall out of

3979.8 --> 3987.36
line make the Machine stop and that

3982.29 --> 3990.57
makes them angry hey don't you code that

3987.36 --> 3994.44
anger down the ranks and so the bottom

3990.57 --> 3997.65
we'll be like yeah my company or my boss

3994.44 --> 4000.37
or this group I'm part of his angry

3997.65 --> 4004.09
because that figure over there is

4000.37 --> 4005.5299999999997
frustrating them or is blaspheming or

4004.09 --> 4016.28
[Music]

4005.53 --> 4018.77
damaging the economy see it's that darn

4016.28 --> 4020.3300000000004
net that commented he made while ago

4018.77 --> 4023.87
right what

4020.33 --> 4026.87
so mmm you said that you you wouldn't

4023.87 --> 4029.69
say certain things cuz your fear people

4026.87 --> 4032.3599999999997
would think you're not yeah crazy crazy

4029.69 --> 4035.69
is what you mean right yeah I'll just

4032.36 --> 4040.79
mean that they've purse stigma on waking

4035.69 --> 4042.98
up so listen um I know I'm kind of

4040.79 --> 4045.2599999999998
putting you on the spot no but what what

4042.98 --> 4049.4900000000002
creates that that feeling inside of you

4045.26 --> 4053.0600000000004
well what do you think I guess societal

4049.49 --> 4055.4599999999996
pressure peer pressure and conditioning

4053.06 --> 4057.92
conditioning in general I guess is you

4055.46 --> 4060.8
torture like from school and everything

4057.92 --> 4062.69
is matter really and then they tell you

4060.8 --> 4064.3700000000003
in another lesson this is what some

4062.69 --> 4066.85
people believe and tell you about

4064.37 --> 4070.0299999999997
spirits and stuff a little bit tiny bit

4066.85 --> 4072.65
so I was an I fist for most of my life

4070.03 --> 4074.4500000000003
but then it's hard for me to suddenly

4072.65 --> 4079.55
say I think I believe in something more

4074.45 --> 4081.68
now it's hard to express and obviously

4079.55 --> 4083.1800000000003
I'm relaying it to flowers and Globus I

4081.68 --> 4086.96
spent a lot of time with globe Arthur's

4083.18 --> 4089.06
for over a year so as soon as I started

4086.96 --> 4095.2400000000002
saying the things that they thought was

4089.06 --> 4097.18
silly I felt silly sometimes right I'm

4095.24 --> 4099.5599999999995
just curious I'm curious of where that

4097.18 --> 4100.72
where that feeling comes from and that

4099.56 --> 4105.29
not actually it was a good answer

4100.72 --> 4106.97
conditioning not very strong well and

4105.29 --> 4109.339
the group think you you don't want to be

4106.97 --> 4111.650000000001
outside of sometimes dear you have to

4109.339 --> 4113.87
choose how you're gonna show express

4111.65 --> 4115.19
that you're an outsider you know you

4113.87 --> 4117.589
don't want to run down the stree and a

4115.19 --> 4120.429999999999
pink dress yeah well some people do

4117.589 --> 4120.43
actually yeah

4120.67 --> 4126.31
yeah that's happening too you know yeah

4124.44 --> 4130.349999999999
well nice is Esther day with

4126.31 --> 4133.929
conditioning as well because they

4130.35 --> 4138.219
there's a there's a guy an older older

4133.929 --> 4140.9800000000005
retired man he he sits outside of where

4138.219 --> 4144.64
I work and there's a there's a really

4140.98 --> 4147.339
big traffic intersection where a lot of

4144.64 --> 4150.759
people that live in my area they they

4147.339 --> 4154.449
have to come down this road and he's got

4150.759 --> 4159.029
huge signs he's holding up by the

4154.449 --> 4162.58
traffic light saying Jesus is coming and

4159.029 --> 4166.029
yeah III can look at him and I can tell

4162.58 --> 4169.299
that he is he has lost all ability to

4166.029 --> 4171.819
care what people think of him he's

4169.299 --> 4175.39
stepping up and I was relating that to

4171.819 --> 4178.509
dawn is because dawn he he wants

4175.39 --> 4180.31
acceptance he workers well I said I'm

4178.509 --> 4182.65
just expressing that sometimes it's been

4180.31 --> 4189.819
hard but I have broken out and express

4182.65 --> 4192.25
stuff I think probably everyone has some

4189.819 --> 4193.27
point during their life be very young or

4192.25 --> 4197.469
via very old

4193.27 --> 4202.3
depending on the approach the angle

4197.469 --> 4209.28
their journey but yeah it's always how

4202.3 --> 4213.4890000000005
long can you hold on or yeah will you be

4209.28 --> 4215.139999999999
like damaged because of it it's awful

4213.489 --> 4218.23
I've always had like an existential

4215.14 --> 4222.79
crisis but I think flower woke it up

4218.23 --> 4224.799999999999
again quite strong I kind of used as a

4222.79 --> 4227.16
stepping stone to then question other

4224.8 --> 4227.16
stuff

4227.69 --> 4235.759999999999
well that's good I guess yeah yeah I

4231.38 --> 4238.400000000001
love it for that yeah look you can say

4235.76 --> 4241.01
anything you want about Flat Earth but

4238.4 --> 4244.28
one thing is absolutely certain and that

4241.01 --> 4246.9400000000005
is it makes people think yep like

4244.28 --> 4253.4
nothing else out there it forces them to

4246.94 --> 4259.129999999999
snap and yeah just it's so confronting

4253.4 --> 4262.089999999999
and yeah it's hilarious that it does

4259.13 --> 4264.59
that great dangerous sometimes yeah

4262.09 --> 4267.2300000000005
really snap people out of it like

4264.59 --> 4268.969
nothing else I see it like I could then

4267.23 --> 4270.5
guru if you went there for a month and

4268.969 --> 4272.3
he was taking you through challenges and

4270.5 --> 4274.07
tearing down your paradigms like glass

4272.3 --> 4275.84
would be in a week long one where he

4274.07 --> 4277.61
gets you to go away and say are you

4275.84 --> 4279.9490000000005
actually sure where you live

4277.61 --> 4281.929
do you trust those people that told you

4279.949 --> 4283.759999999999
where you live and then you'd have to

4281.929 --> 4286.159
think over for a week and your mind will

4283.76 --> 4289.4490000000005
be blown but then you'd have another

4286.159 --> 4289.449
challenge for you after that

4295.489 --> 4303.2
until there is no more or probably until

4299.48 --> 4308.299999999999
we've had enough and if we didn't have

4303.2 --> 4310.429999999999
enough they're still always more I don't

4308.3 --> 4315.46
know if everyone can ever know if there

4310.43 --> 4318.4400000000005
is ever an end to that

4315.46 --> 4321.85
maybe that's the gods challenge to

4318.44 --> 4326.839999999999
humanity like how far can you take [ __ ]

4321.85 --> 4332.860000000001
how extreme how extreme can you let the

4326.84 --> 4337.09
darkness be and how amazing can you let

4332.86 --> 4339.889999999999
the distractions become and how strong

4337.09 --> 4343.400000000001
can you wield the light in the face of

4339.89 --> 4346.820000000001
it all I kind of feel like we have to

4343.4 --> 4348.98
observe the darkness to understand when

4346.82 --> 4351.46
we have the light but try and stay away

4348.98 --> 4354.83
from the darkness and just observe it

4351.46 --> 4358.27
right because without seeing that we're

4354.83 --> 4358.2699999999995
not gonna understand what the light is

4359.8 --> 4367.84
my dad always told me if you play with

4362.69 --> 4371.989
[ __ ] you're gonna get [ __ ] no I

4367.84 --> 4374.03
understand and I was I was actually

4371.989 --> 4376.419999999999
impressed with what what Don said

4374.03 --> 4379.2699999999995
yesterday

4376.42 --> 4383.93
Don actually admitted that you know

4379.27 --> 4387.4400000000005
sign-sign science really doesn't prove

4383.93 --> 4390.320000000001
anything and just I don't really

4387.44 --> 4392.33
remember everything your your quote Don

4390.32 --> 4394.19
but just the way you were talking

4392.33 --> 4397.28
yesterday on it in what sense in an

4394.19 --> 4400.129999999999
existential sense in pain sense because

4397.28 --> 4402.23
that is what it does but Kanaka is a

4400.13 --> 4404.81
completely proof it's like it proves

4402.23 --> 4406.82
this and that solid it proves that the

4404.81 --> 4409.280000000001
hypothesis is correct I think so it's

4406.82 --> 4412.88
tell us disproven right yeah but that's

4409.28 --> 4414.469
not full 100% fact proof knowledge but

4412.88 --> 4416.4800000000005
you have to decide if it's effective

4414.469 --> 4418.13
knowledge after you've proposed no no

4416.48 --> 4420.589999999999
that's wrong it is a fact proof

4418.13 --> 4424.01
knowledge it just doesn't explain

4420.59 --> 4425.81
everything else all right for that one

4424.01 --> 4428.08
thing do you think science can prove

4425.81 --> 4428.080000000001
stuff

4429.11 --> 4437.0599999999995
are you asking me or are Oh up to a

4432.14 --> 4439.37
certain level definitely well although

4437.06 --> 4441.830000000001
the more I deal with it the more limited

4439.37 --> 4445.4
it actually seems I guess what I meant

4441.83 --> 4447.44
is it's never 100% proof you've just

4445.4 --> 4449.42
proved a hypothesis to be correct in

4447.44 --> 4451.28
that instance well that's what it's all

4449.42 --> 4453.62
about isn't it it's never a hundred

4451.28 --> 4457.73
percent proof only a hundred percent

4453.62 --> 4461.57
proof until this proven and that's just

4457.73 --> 4464.0599999999995
an existential fact yeah I mean science

4461.57 --> 4469.099999999999
still doesn't know where why or how

4464.06 --> 4471.530000000001
we're here basically when either right

4469.1 --> 4476.35
it's quite a mile it leaves that to the

4471.53 --> 4476.349999999999
imagination yeah that's great

4476.92 --> 4485.56
that's what I think I theists or a

4479.09 --> 4488.6900000000005
little bit miss got it now don't you

4485.56 --> 4492.200000000001
don't you guys think that it's it's in

4488.69 --> 4494.0599999999995
this conversation slanderous or globert

4492.2 --> 4495.5599999999995
so don't you think it's very very

4494.06 --> 4500.120000000001
important that if that at least a

4495.56 --> 4503.660000000001
baseline Beedrill that really its own

4500.12 --> 4509.33
it's it's only proof until something

4503.66 --> 4512.12
either debunks it or changes yeah I mean

4509.33 --> 4515.54
I kind of agree with you on but hey if

4512.12 --> 4517.88
you if you prove something then I can

4515.54 --> 4519.92
spend day and night trying to disprove

4517.88 --> 4523.34
it and if I get other data I can at

4519.92 --> 4526.13
least provide other data right that'll

4523.34 --> 4530.56
either add to the proof or break it but

4526.13 --> 4534.02
that's all I know it's on the globe oh

4530.56 --> 4538.04
we're trying from what think some people

4534.02 --> 4543.35
think is proven right why they don't

4538.04 --> 4547.97
really understand what proof is even in

4543.35 --> 4550.27
Suns proof well there's a lot of claims

4547.97 --> 4553.570000000001
out there

4550.27 --> 4557.35
yeah as I said before like how much of

4553.57 --> 4560.23
it out there is really Bluff you know

4557.35 --> 4563.29
based on belief of some kind some kind

4560.23 --> 4565.78
of objective some kind of direction I

4563.29 --> 4568.3
like to think at least 50% of science is

4565.78 --> 4572.28
true and then the 50% is creative

4568.3 --> 4578.71
license just to make myself feel better

4572.28 --> 4581.2
scientists need Ferraris to men no they

4578.71 --> 4587.02
need a moral compass that's what they

4581.2 --> 4591.09
need I all I was saying dawn is I

4587.02 --> 4593.950000000001
thought I appreciate from from your

4591.09 --> 4595.6900000000005
aspect you being a globe or I appreciate

4593.95 --> 4598.0
from you saying that I thought that was

4595.69 --> 4599.919999999999
pretty impressive fishery yeah coming

4598.0 --> 4601.6
from you no matter what Mark Taylor says

4599.92 --> 4603.4
about you I actually got that off my

4601.6 --> 4606.97
feet she's the one who told me no

4603.4 --> 4609.19
science doesn't prove anything 100% now

4606.97 --> 4611.17
you went south I was giving you good

4609.19 --> 4612.549999999999
stuff and then you brought up there no

4611.17 --> 4614.91
I'm this I'll just give him credit where

4612.55 --> 4617.68
credit's to that's not mine yeah I

4614.91 --> 4619.51
understand but yeah yeah I'm like when

4617.68 --> 4621.820000000001
you said that yesterday I was thinking

4619.51 --> 4630.43
about that holiday I was like that's

4621.82 --> 4631.719999999999
right like yeah that was good every now

4630.43 --> 4638.8
and then daughter come over and say

4631.72 --> 4640.900000000001
something yeah I still believe I'm on a

4638.8 --> 4644.26
spinning globe but I can't prove it it's

4640.9 --> 4653.08
a belief and I question if I'm correct

4644.26 --> 4655.6900000000005
or not I'm thankful that he said believe

4653.08 --> 4657.79
he admits that he believes it yeah

4655.69 --> 4661.24
that's all I want

4657.79 --> 4666.91
it's a fantastical story and it is it is

4661.24 --> 4671.469999999999
iaa and it almost worked I mean it kind

4666.91 --> 4675.19
of does you have to spend this belief to

4671.47 --> 4677.530000000001
make it work a few times don't you yeah

4675.19 --> 4678.429999999999
and you have to look over those bumps

4677.53 --> 4682.219999999999
and

4678.43 --> 4684.62
yeah that's the trick it is I think it

4682.22 --> 4687.5
is like a religious fantasy and yeah

4684.62 --> 4690.5599999999995
nothing next but the then they just try

4687.5 --> 4693.11
to make the energy or the joy of it yeah

4690.56 --> 4695.3
make you overlook that I wonder if any

4693.11 --> 4697.849999999999
full explanation of reality of reality

4695.3 --> 4699.2
would be the same you know in a parallel

4697.85 --> 4701.3
universe if there was a completely

4699.2 --> 4702.7699999999995
different explanation of reality other

4701.3 --> 4705.43
people would still be silent on that bit

4702.77 --> 4705.43
doesn't seem right

4706.12 --> 4711.5199999999995
maybe probably

4713.699 --> 4720.299999999999
yeah you make a good point and I

4717.69 --> 4722.099999999999
described it before in the process of

4720.3 --> 4723.63
the light in the darkness and how things

4722.1 --> 4727.14
go through time that yeah there's always

4723.63 --> 4729.4490000000005
something new you know every time one

4727.14 --> 4731.55
side thinks oh we got it and then

4729.449 --> 4733.62
suddenly something new starts to

4731.55 --> 4736.320000000001
happening that nobody really expected or

4733.62 --> 4740.3099999999995
saw coming even though in the grand

4736.32 --> 4742.71
scheme it is really obvious you know how

4740.31 --> 4744.360000000001
I feel sometimes when a new flower thing

4742.71 --> 4746.88
comes up and the globus have to deal

4744.36 --> 4748.44
with it and research it it's almost like

4746.88 --> 4750.87
the Flat Earth story's been written as

4748.44 --> 4754.32
well but it's hidden and it's brought

4750.87 --> 4757.92
out in stages like group consciousness

4754.32 --> 4761.429
or a plan or an op or I don't know just

4757.92 --> 4762.96
a story being released I don't know but

4761.429 --> 4766.37
it seems to come up in stages done at

4762.96 --> 4769.92
the battle between the different nuances

4766.37 --> 4772.07
pretty crazy story as to how I think

4769.92 --> 4778.52
where it's coming from

4772.07 --> 4782.549999999999
but it might it may be recycled goods

4778.52 --> 4784.71
look I think that there's been more

4782.55 --> 4788.13
attempts at Flat Earth awakenings

4784.71 --> 4790.53
throughout history and as they were

4788.13 --> 4793.29
taken down and completely erased or

4790.53 --> 4796.469
rewritten to leave that aspect out there

4793.29 --> 4799.71
would be people that would just could

4796.469 --> 4803.34
not resist the value of God basically

4799.71 --> 4806.969
and the truth and they would take books

4803.34 --> 4810.929
and things and hide it and keep it in

4806.969 --> 4813.39
secret until everything's forgotten and

4810.929 --> 4817.55
I think that this Flat Earth Awakening

4813.39 --> 4817.55
is the respawn of it

4817.79 --> 4823.82
it's basically the information surfacing

4820.58 --> 4826.73
again without actually telling you where

4823.82 --> 4830.75
it's coming from the period where where

4826.73 --> 4834.65
it was made by whom you are just letting

4830.75 --> 4835.67
it float like yeah this they wanted they

4834.65 --> 4840.17
want the truth

4835.67 --> 4842.54
really there's probably so many people

4840.17 --> 4845.6
like that know much more of the bigger

4842.54 --> 4848.48
picture or know it for sure or have also

4845.6 --> 4850.280000000001
went in the into the depth I don't know

4848.48 --> 4853.73
the context of all these people I also

4850.28 --> 4857.84
just want the light they really do and

4853.73 --> 4860.2699999999995
this is maybe maybe it is like the final

4857.84 --> 4863.24
attempt I don't want to sound fatalistic

4860.27 --> 4868.25
but maybe this is like the last chance

4863.24 --> 4869.36
the last remnants of of this this anchor

4868.25 --> 4873.11
within truth

4869.36 --> 4875.54
I wonder if back 500 years ago when most

4873.11 --> 4878.63
people didn't know the wider reality

4875.54 --> 4880.82
shape when he leers interest when

4878.63 --> 4882.47
heliocentrism started I wonder if that

4880.82 --> 4884.0
was released in stages and no one really

4882.47 --> 4886.43
knew where that story came from and it

4884.0 --> 4888.26
just slowly propagated by in a similar

4886.43 --> 4890.63
way like mirroring effect no I don't

4888.26 --> 4894.9800000000005
think so I think people damn well knew

4890.63 --> 4897.2300000000005
where it was coming from well and then

4894.98 --> 4899.179999999999
it was forced on to people through

4897.23 --> 4901.37
Empire yeah

4899.18 --> 4904.34
through imperial rule into the schools

4901.37 --> 4906.89
and eventually probably even pursued

4904.34 --> 4909.17
like a religion with Inquisition if you

4906.89 --> 4911.54
went arrested and that's probably where

4909.17 --> 4913.72
the Jesuits basically came in to the

4911.54 --> 4913.72
picture

4914.01 --> 4921.26
my RIA was what they did at least then

4918.26 --> 4921.26
and

4923.739 --> 4929.11
I think everybody knew you know that's

4927.039 --> 4933.039
the that's the thing is truth is

4929.11 --> 4936.489
freaking contagious it is contagious and

4933.039 --> 4941.32
it is glorious and it's very hard to get

4936.489 --> 4943.57
rid of and that's their main problem

4941.32 --> 4947.829
it's so hard to get rid of once it takes

4943.57 --> 4950.499
a foothold once God gets that toe in

4947.829 --> 4953.219
between the door of your mind yeah he's

4950.499 --> 4955.9
not letting go so easily

4953.219 --> 4958.9
pulling down a religion is almost

4955.9 --> 4962.32
impossible at what well it's not

4958.9 --> 4965.138999999999
religion it's just the truth aspect

4962.32 --> 4968.349
religion is also a control structure you

4965.139 --> 4971.979
know well I mean like heliocentrism all

4968.349 --> 4973.51
right calling that a religion like if we

4971.979 --> 4976.559
look at other religions it's quite

4973.51 --> 4976.559
impossible to put it down

4980.969 --> 4986.39
well

4983.24 --> 4990.219999999999
depends every religion as it has

4986.39 --> 4990.22
manifested has some serious problems

4990.34 --> 4998.6
yeah but at least they're like trying in

4994.19 --> 4999.95
some way they're trying to achieve I

4998.6 --> 5001.84
kind of see what he's saying though

4999.95 --> 5005.2
because in the country that I live it's

5001.84 --> 5006.85
it's based in Christianity but there's a

5005.2 --> 5011.01
Christian Church on every corner

5006.85 --> 5013.51
I kind of see his point

5011.01 --> 5016.35
it's gone but not forgotten sometimes

5013.51 --> 5016.35
right

5018.72 --> 5024.79
what's it's kind of kinda like Esau

5021.76 --> 5028.030000000001
always says things like God will never

5024.79 --> 5030.34
give you if there isn't God God will

5028.03 --> 5033.7
never give you more than you can bear

5030.34 --> 5035.53
you know and well I don't I don't I

5033.7 --> 5038.8
don't know if there's a god I used to be

5035.53 --> 5041.83
Christian but I got out of it to me I

5038.8 --> 5044.110000000001
think I think that that our Creator is

5041.83 --> 5046.3
some type of energy I don't think it's a

5044.11 --> 5050.38
bearded man in the clouds judging you

5046.3 --> 5053.9800000000005
right I think it I think and I think all

5050.38 --> 5055.21
that energy in his first he's got blond

5053.98 --> 5061.509999999999
energy though because that's kind of

5055.21 --> 5065.11
what science says in a way to me it just

5061.51 --> 5071.74
seems like devil seems to be in this

5065.11 --> 5076.049999999999
world and God is much stronger but he is

5071.74 --> 5079.32
outside and he's letting it yeah

5076.05 --> 5082.4800000000005
instantly philosophy they say it's not

5079.32 --> 5084.3099999999995
personified basically the light needs to

5082.48 --> 5088.209999999999
be two-thirds on the dark needs to be

5084.31 --> 5091.6900000000005
one-third so quite good with a pearpod

5088.21 --> 5093.7300000000005
equals good capital G but if it's 50/50

5091.69 --> 5095.53
as [ __ ] so we have to have dark there

5093.73 --> 5097.389999999999
but we have to constantly be just

5095.53 --> 5100.259999999999
winning but it feels that a minute like

5097.39 --> 5100.26
they're taking over

5104.67 --> 5114.82
yeah that Bible what a book like

5112.929 --> 5117.67
sometimes you just have to hear a single

5114.82 --> 5121.57
sentence of something in some part

5117.67 --> 5130.78
somewhere and it just it's like oh yeah

5121.57 --> 5135.308999999999
yeah that okay well I do have to go to

5130.78 --> 5137.4
work I wanted to come on and say hey to

5135.309 --> 5138.55
you man just make sure you're doing okay

5137.4 --> 5140.53
thanks

5138.55 --> 5145.42
yeah thanks for coming the Flat Earth

5140.53 --> 5147.909
debates are starting in a second so yeah

5145.42 --> 5150.46
I will round out the show thank you both

5147.909 --> 5155.199
for coming let's go thank you it's been

5150.46 --> 5162.96
a very good show very tense and good and
