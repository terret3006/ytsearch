98.759 --> 103.5
I mean yesterday it really was Nightmare

101.939 --> 106.079
weather

103.5 --> 108.18
it was like the worst of Dutch weather

106.079 --> 111.77999999999999
pretty much well it could have been

108.18 --> 115.14
worse I mean it could have also like

111.78 --> 119.93900000000001
being very windy it was not so windy but

115.14 --> 122.88
it was just this constant constant rain

119.939 --> 126.6
and it was like dark

122.88 --> 128.7
at half past four because of all the

126.6 --> 131.459
clouds

128.7 --> 133.56
yeah went out in grocery through that

131.459 --> 137.81900000000002
and it literally looked me took me like

133.56 --> 141.98
two hours to completely dry up from that

137.819 --> 144.89999999999998
was terrible but today not so today

141.98 --> 146.39999999999998
clouds of well mostly gone there's a

144.9 --> 149.459
little bit of haze up there I don't

146.4 --> 151.26000000000002
think it's caused by trails from planes

149.459 --> 154.31900000000002
or anything but

151.26 --> 156.319
yeah some can definitely come through

154.319 --> 159.42
there's not a lot of wind

156.319 --> 161.879
it is actually kind of cold but it

159.42 --> 165.07999999999998
doesn't feel that cold at all

161.879 --> 165.07999999999998
not with the Sun out

166.739 --> 169.81900000000002

340.5 --> 343.039

right

363.63 --> 367.4
[Music]

um

372.66 --> 379.32000000000005
all right

375.199 --> 381.57
minus 12 damn yeah at least G sounds

379.32 --> 385.519
like full on winter then

381.57 --> 385.519
[Music]

391.139 --> 402.84000000000003
all right

391.89 --> 406.58
[Music]

402.84 --> 406.58
all right so yesterday

408.56 --> 412.94
a flat Earth early bird show

414.539 --> 419.18
flat side was live again that was a lot

416.88 --> 419.18
of fun

420.66 --> 423.66
uh

430.46 --> 437.06
oh yeah yeah in Quantum of conscious at

434.88 --> 442.62
a really good

437.06 --> 442.62
really interesting show on freevoice.io

442.94 --> 450.66
about bad CGI and how he was analyzing

447.72 --> 454.139
somebody else reviewing movies

450.66 --> 457.86
taking note and how the CGI was kind of

454.139 --> 461.099
getting worse over time and yeah Quantum

457.86 --> 464.72
conscious Matt you kind of like

461.099 --> 468.419
put another layer on that study

464.72 --> 469.56
and I mean that kind of made sense his

468.419 --> 471.78
overall

469.56 --> 474.9
conception was that there is a chance

471.78 --> 477.9
that the CGI is getting worse not just

474.9 --> 479.52
because studios are just rushing it more

477.9 --> 482.94
with the CGI

479.52 --> 485.4
right wow for example

482.94 --> 488.819
one of the better examples of CGI

485.4 --> 492.96
application uh Jurassic Park the

488.819 --> 496.5
original one well there was a lot of

492.96 --> 500.21999999999997
time not just money but a lot of time

496.5 --> 502.56
spent by the CGI Department there to

500.22 --> 505.319
make it real

502.56 --> 507.96
right and in these days with all these

505.319 --> 511.379
modern movies special like superhero

507.96 --> 512.9399999999999
Marvel type movies they just don't take

511.379 --> 514.5
the time anymore and they probably

512.94 --> 517.5600000000001
wouldn't even have the time anymore

514.5 --> 518.88
because so much has become CGI that they

517.56 --> 523.14
just

518.88 --> 524.9399999999999
like the refinement of actually making

523.14 --> 529.3199999999999
it trickery

524.94 --> 533.0400000000001
instead of just a cartoon is lost

529.32 --> 536.6600000000001
right and Quantum conscious put another

533.04 --> 536.66
layer on top of that

536.76 --> 541.019
by suggesting that

538.98 --> 543.72
uh

541.019 --> 544.92
yeah that it might be in preparation for

543.72 --> 547.86
some

544.92 --> 550.68
uh new amazing space event where they

547.86 --> 553.62
would pull out the best CGI and so

550.68 --> 555.54
movies would have to like downgrade

553.62 --> 558.36
their CGI

555.54 --> 561.899
to make the movies look more fake

558.36 --> 564.54
while then the space adventure

561.899 --> 567.36
official rollout would look like the

564.54 --> 569.64
most pristine perfect CGI ever imagined

567.36 --> 571.26
that was his idea and

569.64 --> 574.019
yeah

571.26 --> 577.08
I mean of where are the worst ideas is

574.019 --> 577.98
definitely interesting just to to ponder

577.08 --> 580.7
it

577.98 --> 585.5600000000001
so I definitely recommend everybody

580.7 --> 585.5600000000001
watches that video

588.12 --> 591.74
so I'll post the link

594.26 --> 600.72
Jurassic Park was amazing for its time

596.519 --> 603.779
yeah but it's also better CGI

600.72 --> 606.48
than the newer Jurassic Park type movies

603.779 --> 609.42
and that was like a big point

606.48 --> 612.36
is that it is actually better like

609.42 --> 615.959
literally you put it one movie you play

612.36 --> 619.5
it right next to the newer movie similar

615.959 --> 621.66
scene you'll see that actually looks

619.5 --> 624.18
like it could be real you're wondering

621.66 --> 627.0
like is that an animatronic or is it a

624.18 --> 630.54
CGI you're not sure the newer one you

627.0 --> 632.22
immediately see this is a CDI [ __ ] Fest

630.54 --> 637.04
just like computer games

632.22 --> 637.0400000000001
you just see it you immediately see it

637.38 --> 643.38
and he shows that or rather the guy he's

640.68 --> 647.2199999999999
reviewing shows that and yeah

643.38 --> 648.6899999999999
it's really worth watching that video or

647.22 --> 651.6
studying

648.69 --> 654.3000000000001
[Music]

651.6 --> 656.339
Jurassic world that was lame

654.3 --> 657.54
all the newer [ __ ] is kind of lame I

656.339 --> 661.2
mean it's just like oh there are any

657.54 --> 663.18
Source there they are again but like

661.2 --> 665.1600000000001
yeah I mean that could just be like a

663.18 --> 667.9799999999999
Pixar movie

665.16 --> 671.04
you know what I mean right it's like oh

667.98 --> 673.62
it's just like a Pixar cartoon CGI movie

671.04 --> 677.42
almost I mean

673.62 --> 677.42
it doesn't look real anymore

677.459 --> 682.68
you don't get the visceral Instinct

679.74 --> 685.6800000000001
responses from seeing it

682.68 --> 688.14
it's just not real anymore

685.68 --> 689.76
like you eventually in your mind as I

688.14 --> 692.3389999999999
was like watching Jurassic world you're

689.76 --> 695.7
just starting to wonder like oh how is

692.339 --> 698.7
the computer game cut scene going to

695.7 --> 700.38
move forward right you're it's so

698.7 --> 702.899
distracting that you actually start to

700.38 --> 706.26
think about plot points rather than be

702.899 --> 707.82
in the moment right to have that

706.26 --> 708.5699999999999
experience in the moment you just it

707.82 --> 709.86
doesn't work anymore

708.57 --> 712.6800000000001
[Music]

709.86 --> 715.14
good video watch it

712.68 --> 718.64
mean it

715.14 --> 718.64
all right just follow the link

721.92 --> 729.14
so yeah that was very much a Worthy

725.7 --> 729.1400000000001
video from map

729.54 --> 733.8199999999999
oh also by the way I

731.82 --> 738.24
I passed the

733.82 --> 743.3000000000001
2.58 subscriber work for the first time

738.24 --> 743.3
so it's slowly but gradually going up

746.54 --> 750.26
uh what else

752.76 --> 756.4399999999999
yeah I think that was pretty much it

773.1 --> 775.44
right so yeah what have you guys been up

775.2 --> 777.24
to

775.44 --> 780.24
[Music]

777.24 --> 780.24
foreign

784.04 --> 788.669
[Music]

794.38 --> 797.58
[Music]

801.48 --> 806.279
any feedback

803.579 --> 808.92
yesterday's show on anything any

806.279 --> 811.639
feedback any kind of rollout in the chat

808.92 --> 811.639
would be great

811.88 --> 818.1
I'm really getting sick of how slow my

814.74 --> 821.22
chat is I mean

818.1 --> 823.26
I don't like it it's nice that it it

821.22 --> 825.1800000000001
really starts rolling like in the last

823.26 --> 826.38
half hour

825.18 --> 828.18
but

826.38 --> 830.779
I mean

828.18 --> 830.779
come on

835.26 --> 841.079
I mean if the chat just doesn't

837.72 --> 843.6
naturally start rolling continually

841.079 --> 846.12
every show I am going to cut the show

843.6 --> 849.019
down I'm going to cut it down to an hour

846.12 --> 849.019
permanently

849.12 --> 855.54
I don't want people to just look if you

853.32 --> 859.2
don't want to be in a chat you just want

855.54 --> 861.74
to listen then just listen and like

859.2 --> 864.6
don't come here I mean

861.74 --> 866.9590000000001
interact or just listen in the

864.6 --> 866.9590000000001
background

867.0 --> 872.16
I don't want anything in between anymore

868.86 --> 874.62
it just I need proper interaction with

872.16 --> 877.3389999999999
the chat I really need it or this show

874.62 --> 879.899
will not work

877.339 --> 882.0600000000001
for the record

879.899 --> 885.48
hmm

882.06 --> 888.3
which we can hard work done nice

885.48 --> 890.76
now you've been busy

888.3 --> 893.7199999999999
oh playing video games oh dear

890.76 --> 893.72
what video games

900.24 --> 904.139
install our black hole scene took

902.339 --> 907.0400000000001
hundreds of a hundred hours to render

904.139 --> 907.04
each yeah

907.199 --> 913.15
Daisy oh Jesus zombie [ __ ]

911.04 --> 914.9399999999999
zombie shooter or something

913.15 --> 916.56
[Music]

914.94 --> 918.72
all right

916.56 --> 922.5
but yeah the interstellar black hole was

918.72 --> 923.82
like a state-of-the-art CGI like one of

922.5 --> 927.12
the highest

923.82 --> 931.4590000000001
heaviest calculated stuff and that's why

927.12 --> 931.4590000000001
it looked so freaking amazing

932.31 --> 939.68
[Music]

935.639 --> 939.6800000000001
okay good to see you

940.13 --> 944.779
[Music]

949.32 --> 954.38
you have a great CGI story oh okay

954.54 --> 959.66
let me hear it hello Wells rice

975.06 --> 979.0189999999999
all right but yeah the interstellar

976.98 --> 982.44
black hole thing look

979.019 --> 983.16
they like really unleashed the math on

982.44 --> 985.62
it

983.16 --> 988.6899999999999
so they basically made like a really

985.62 --> 990.0
complicated fractal like Crystal

988.69 --> 992.82
[Music]

990.0 --> 995.279
for the light basically to travel so

992.82 --> 999.48
what you're looking at that image

995.279 --> 1001.519
is like a a giant hallway of mirrors of

999.48 --> 1003.62
the light and what it does and how it

1001.519 --> 1005.36
reflects like it's a really freaking

1003.62 --> 1008.66
heavy thing

1005.36 --> 1012.1990000000001
right I mean anybody could like paint an

1008.66 --> 1015.019
idea of a black hole or whatever but

1012.199 --> 1017.899
they actually just made it

1015.019 --> 1021.399
like a gigantic

1017.899 --> 1021.399
ball of mirrors

1022.6 --> 1028.24
and like on a very big scale so yeah

1025.699 --> 1032.3600000000001
that takes a lot of time to render that

1028.24 --> 1036.02
it's comparable to when I on my Amiga

1032.36 --> 1037.4589999999998
1200 in the late 90s tried to Ray trace

1036.02 --> 1041.36
an image

1037.459 --> 1043.939
uh with like uh marble like reflective

1041.36 --> 1045.9799999999998
like a mirror-like surfaces mirror balls

1043.939 --> 1048.0790000000002
it was very beautiful to do that it's

1045.98 --> 1050.6
like wow look at that it's so realistic

1048.079 --> 1052.78
but it took a lot of time to render and

1050.6 --> 1055.3999999999999
that was just a basic mirror ball

1052.78 --> 1057.08
eventually when when I started to fool

1055.4 --> 1059.96
around with it I just kind of left the

1057.08 --> 1062.059
mirror [ __ ] out because it would be a

1059.96 --> 1065.3600000000001
giant drain on the time it would take

1062.059 --> 1068.8999999999999
the render every time so can you imagine

1065.36 --> 1073.059
this thing being like a giant ball of

1068.9 --> 1073.0590000000002
like thousands of layers of mirrors

1074.0 --> 1077.9
yeah

1076.16 --> 1080.059
and that's with really Advanced

1077.9 --> 1082.6000000000001
Computers

1080.059 --> 1082.6
anyway

1084.22 --> 1089.14
CGI army jet back videos what

1096.799 --> 1099.28
what

1099.74 --> 1104.0
foreign

1101.679 --> 1106.76
that's not real

1104.0 --> 1109.1
is it CGI for sure how the hell did they

1106.76 --> 1111.919
do it then

1109.1 --> 1114.5
I mean I still remember that that video

1111.919 --> 1116.539
of basically the guy in a jet pack going

1114.5 --> 1119.84
around and like even

1116.539 --> 1123.44
over mountains and bridges and [ __ ]

1119.84 --> 1126.9189999999999
how is that CGI

1123.44 --> 1128.799
I mean did they literally just filmed

1126.919 --> 1133.3600000000001
the guy in the studio and then just

1128.799 --> 1133.36
cgi-eyed him over the landscape

1133.94 --> 1135.94
um

1137.36 --> 1142.52
my Tesseract scenes or mine more

1140.059 --> 1144.86
mind-boggling than yeah

1142.52 --> 1146.78
yeah but that's because it was just more

1144.86 --> 1150.559
in your face

1146.78 --> 1153.08
I mean the whole black hole was just the

1150.559 --> 1154.94
rendering was super heavy and you just

1153.08 --> 1157.6999999999998
get to see the end result but they made

1154.94 --> 1160.7
the light go through all the the steps

1157.7 --> 1160.7
basically

1161.48 --> 1168.88
and yeah the Tesseract team was just

1163.88 --> 1168.88
well that's just surreal amazing

1169.24 --> 1175.24
anyway hey Nathan Oakley 1980 good to

1173.059 --> 1175.24
see you

1184.76 --> 1190.179
flying low or real

1187.34 --> 1190.1789999999999
okay

1196.46 --> 1201.64
huh

1199.1 --> 1201.6399999999999
foreign

1203.66 --> 1210.8600000000001
so you're saying slow-mo that basically

1206.6 --> 1213.3799999999999
with the jetpack thing you can hover but

1210.86 --> 1215.7199999999998
you can't go up high because you you

1213.38 --> 1216.98
probably don't have like the the actual

1215.72 --> 1219.14
enough

1216.98 --> 1221.84
push

1219.14 --> 1223.8200000000002
you need the ground to be close by in

1221.84 --> 1225.62
order to create enough pressure to keep

1223.82 --> 1227.36
you afloat like that

1225.62 --> 1229.52
is that it

1227.36 --> 1232.12
hmm

1229.52 --> 1232.12
foreign

1236.62 --> 1241.52
CDI is more widely used today of course

1239.24 --> 1246.2
yeah Terror but the problem is is that

1241.52 --> 1248.48
they're like movies become CGI Reliant

1246.2 --> 1251.6000000000001
like they can't do it without the CGI

1248.48 --> 1253.58
that sucks like if they have entire

1251.6 --> 1256.039
characters that are CGI and supposed

1253.58 --> 1258.98
real life action movies

1256.039 --> 1260.96
it's just stupid it's a really terrible

1258.98 --> 1264.08
Trend it's lazy

1260.96 --> 1270.14
is lazy it's really freaking lazy proper

1264.08 --> 1273.6789999999999
CGI the way to apply it is sparingly

1270.14 --> 1275.9
and what the best way to apply CGI is to

1273.679 --> 1278.24
basically have as much practical effects

1275.9 --> 1283.039
as you possibly can

1278.24 --> 1285.86
and then quick quick micro scenes of CGI

1283.039 --> 1288.62
in between so that you don't get this

1285.86 --> 1290.299
that you don't it just it's like in your

1288.62 --> 1294.4399999999998
face and then gone so that you don't

1290.299 --> 1298.1
notice that is the way to apply a CGI

1294.44 --> 1301.159
that's what movies like Terminator 2 and

1298.1 --> 1303.5
Jurassic Park completely got right

1301.159 --> 1304.5800000000002
they got it all right they did it

1303.5 --> 1310.1
perfectly

1304.58 --> 1314.72
spare CGI sparingly with a lot of care

1310.1 --> 1318.08
to make it to hide it to hide that it is

1314.72 --> 1320.24
CGI that's how they used to do it when

1318.08 --> 1321.799
this all came through all was all first

1320.24 --> 1325.159
revolutionary

1321.799 --> 1327.559
now it's just too much CGI and even

1325.159 --> 1331.5200000000002
basically Movie Makers themselves just

1327.559 --> 1334.94
get lazy like oh we just do a CGI

1331.52 --> 1337.34
character oh yeah well guess what yeah

1334.94 --> 1342.039
the team is probably not gonna spend as

1337.34 --> 1342.039
much time on perfecting its realism

1342.26 --> 1347.419
right because

1345.08 --> 1348.1699999999998
they just get lazy and they don't get

1347.419 --> 1349.5800000000002
the time

1348.17 --> 1351.8600000000001
[Music]

1349.58 --> 1353.24
or yeah the budget time budgets

1351.86 --> 1356.6589999999999
basically the same they don't get the

1353.24 --> 1359.299
time to basically perfect it

1356.659 --> 1361.5800000000002
is too much CGI too little time to

1359.299 --> 1364.9
perfect it

1361.58 --> 1364.8999999999999
it's only going to get worse

CDI for food okay

1386.059 --> 1391.039
I never even considered that they would

1388.159 --> 1394.0
use CGI for food

1391.039 --> 1394.0
that's messed up

1395.14 --> 1401.72
although see if there was some

1398.299 --> 1405.7
commercial with CGI food I wouldn't

1401.72 --> 1405.7
probably be very appealing to me

1406.34 --> 1412.52
I mean I I know that things like Magnum

1409.88 --> 1414.0200000000002
ice cream would post animation clearly

1412.52 --> 1416.299
animation

1414.02 --> 1418.82
it's like oh yeah that's CGI yeah well

1416.299 --> 1422.36
guess what it's also literally a piece

1418.82 --> 1427.3999999999999
of crap the worst fats imaginable yeah

1422.36 --> 1427.3999999999999

I think I even did that one time just

1561.679 --> 1566.5
very short

1563.0 --> 1566.5
that somebody was

1566.539 --> 1574.46
live streaming me like reviewing me in

1570.919 --> 1577.279
one of anti-flat earthers so then I live

stream reviewed him live stream

reviewing me

1579.52 --> 1583.24
did last very long

1583.94 --> 1587.26
but it was kind of funny

1588.74 --> 1594.5
I don't remember when I did that I think

1591.62 --> 1597.039
it's like the earlier Flat Earth early

1594.5 --> 1597.039
birds

1597.08 --> 1602.86
World Cup oh are they going at it again

1604.039 --> 1609.52

got the weather that I had yesterday

then

1903.34 --> 1908.4189999999999

really wet and cold that's annoying

1944.12 --> 1947.6599999999999

1950.419 --> 1956.38

1958.94 --> 1962.44
cool off much quicker

1962.899 --> 1965.4399999999998
yeah

1965.6 --> 1971.9599999999998

as much as possible

1971.96 --> 1974.799
right anyway

1977.899 --> 1982.1
if somebody sat there was supposedly

1979.88 --> 1984.5590000000002
some Artemis event

1982.1 --> 1986.779

1984.559 --> 1989.44

it's successful yeah sure whatever

2072.119 --> 2079.2400000000002
ah it's not gonna be shitty

2076.48 --> 2081.52
I just hope they're not gonna like if

2079.24 --> 2083.9799999999996
they're really gonna go for something as

2081.52 --> 2086.159
[ __ ] as trying to go back to the

2083.98 --> 2086.159
Moon

2086.679 --> 2091.619

2088.419 --> 2091.6189999999997
Oppenheimer on us

2101.98 --> 2108.96
I don't know if you understand what that

2104.08 --> 2108.96

why not

[Music]

2122.94 --> 2127.42
nukes no

2125.02 --> 2130.359
yeah it did involve Watson off and I

2127.42 --> 2134.14
believe good question an Oppenheimer

2130.359 --> 2136.9
would be what happened back then not

2134.14 --> 2139.7799999999997
nukes because they're freaking fake the

2136.9 --> 2142.359
problem was is that when they just came

2139.78 --> 2145.0600000000004
out with it Opera Heimer made a stupid

2142.359 --> 2147.94
speech about it the destroy your world's

2145.06 --> 2150.52
blah blah yeah well in that time there's

2147.94 --> 2152.339
been a lot of people that were literally

2150.52 --> 2155.92
murdered

2152.339 --> 2159.7599999999998
killed executed

2155.92 --> 2160.8
like by government I think government or

2159.76 --> 2163.78
the military

2160.8 --> 2167.44
under this Oppenheimer guy

2163.78 --> 2172.8390000000004
if they spoke out against nukes if they

2167.44 --> 2174.82
said it was fake you were executed

2172.839 --> 2176.92
you understand

2174.82 --> 2179.82
executed

2176.92 --> 2184.839
bang dead

2179.82 --> 2187.839
no excuse no trial you were killed if

2184.839 --> 2190.359
you opposed the narrative yeah so I'm

2187.839 --> 2193.24
kind of hoping they're not going to try

2190.359 --> 2195.8199999999997
to do that with this because that might

2193.24 --> 2199.0789999999997
mean there's like a whole bunch of flat

2195.82 --> 2199.079
earthers that are gonna get it

2204.22 --> 2207.8799999999997
well on the other hand maybe the

2205.78 --> 2210.2200000000003
blabbermouth should just be getting it

2207.88 --> 2211.9
because they're all Rick [ __ ] anyway

2210.22 --> 2213.64
they don't know what the [ __ ] they're

2211.9 --> 2217.42
saying

2213.64 --> 2219.5789999999997
they don't understand mechanics at all

2217.42 --> 2222.9
so maybe it's for the best if there was

2219.579 --> 2222.9
some kind of an Oppenheimer

2224.26 --> 2228.099
but still a lot of principle I hope they

2226.96 --> 2231.16
won't

2228.099 --> 2233.02
I mean it wouldn't even help I mean

2231.16 --> 2234.94
really it's going to convince the world

2233.02 --> 2238.8
that it really happened if you start

2234.94 --> 2238.8
killing a bunch of flat earthers

2241.359 --> 2245.7999999999997
or maybe they won't just do it like that

2243.52 --> 2248.619
they might just round them up for other

2245.8 --> 2250.3
reasons maybe it's it's going to be like

2248.619 --> 2252.28
oh they're all insane and you're all

2250.3 --> 2254.8590000000004
gonna get forced lobotomies

2252.28 --> 2255.94
right that would be an Oppenheimer as

2254.859 --> 2258.46
well

2255.94 --> 2262.0
and I'm warning you guys

2258.46 --> 2265.42
if they're really gonna supposedly go

2262.0 --> 2269.38
back and thus fake it because it's not

2265.42 --> 2271.42
real it cannot be done there's no place

2269.38 --> 2274.359
where you can land

2271.42 --> 2276.7000000000003
because the Moon is only light

2274.359 --> 2280.5989999999997
right but if they're gonna pull it and

2276.7 --> 2282.339
reinforce it as a new event well then we

2280.599 --> 2284.26
should all be

2282.339 --> 2287.4
well warned

2284.26 --> 2290.5600000000004
that there might be a potential like

2287.4 --> 2293.1600000000003
Roundup of opposition to the idea that

2290.56 --> 2293.16
it's possible

2294.46 --> 2297.119
foreign

2300.599 --> 2306.52
no not really but I mean yeah look I've

2304.72 --> 2310.8999999999996
always been concerned because Anything

2306.52 --> 2314.02
could happen for whatever reason

2310.9 --> 2317.92
if people come to my house

2314.02 --> 2321.64
and try to force vaccinate me or arrest

2317.92 --> 2324.76
me because I'm not vaccinated or declare

2321.64 --> 2327.46
me insane I will defend myself with

2324.76 --> 2331.5400000000004
lethal Force

2327.46 --> 2333.46
and I will not be deterred

2331.54 --> 2336.46
right

2333.46 --> 2338.56
so I don't care I mean pull a pole Opera

2336.46 --> 2341.14
come to my Heist there will be dead

2338.56 --> 2343.56
people throwing over the balcony here

2341.14 --> 2343.56
then

2347.619 --> 2351.579
if you want to get me for that

2349.66 --> 2354.16
and I will freaking do the same thing

2351.579 --> 2356.1400000000003
with the SWAT teams or they'll kill me I

2354.16 --> 2358.8999999999996
don't care I hope it's worth the risk

2356.14 --> 2361.2999999999997
for them because I will finish them off

2358.9 --> 2363.04
if they do that

2361.3 --> 2366.2200000000003
wow

2363.04 --> 2370.02
or die trying because I will not

2366.22 --> 2370.02
surrender ever

2370.42 --> 2373.619
not to that

2374.56 --> 2380.2
I will have free speech unconditional

2377.74 --> 2382.5989999999997
free speech and I will

2380.2 --> 2386.7599999999998
exert it

2382.599 --> 2386.76
or die drying

2387.76 --> 2393.76
and if they shut my internet off then I

2391.119 --> 2396.94
will freaking do it on the streets

2393.76 --> 2398.92
they stopped me there I will dude I'm

2396.94 --> 2401.619
gonna start a revolution

2398.92 --> 2405.28
it will not stop me once I really get

2401.619 --> 2408.579
going so just let this continue for me

2405.28 --> 2412.1800000000003
yeah it's the best way to keep me in

2408.579 --> 2416.099
check so let me do whatever the [ __ ] I

2412.18 --> 2416.0989999999997

hello psych Bear by the way

2456.94 --> 2462.579
and hello seeking star water

2459.94 --> 2465.82
threats from the opposition was hard to

2462.579 --> 2467.92
tell steamy traveler it's really very

2465.82 --> 2469.599
difficult to tell because I get a lot of

2467.92 --> 2471.04
trolls and [ __ ]

2469.599 --> 2473.26
but

2471.04 --> 2474.22
in face-to-face situations in the real

2473.26 --> 2476.82
world

2474.22 --> 2476.8199999999997
uh

2478.54 --> 2482.38
I've mostly been treated either

2480.52 --> 2484.18
perfectly neutral

2482.38 --> 2487.96
or

2484.18 --> 2490.54
people realize yeah that I do I'm not

2487.96 --> 2493.42
really the standard person now am I

2490.54 --> 2495.88
quite a complicated figure with very

2493.42 --> 2500.28
extensive feelings

2495.88 --> 2500.28
and wide range range of

2500.44 --> 2507.94
things I do and ways I do it and

2505.9 --> 2511.7200000000003
I mostly just get

2507.94 --> 2514.119
like treated with respect and care that

2511.72 --> 2516.2799999999997
I deserve right it's like yeah I'm

2514.119 --> 2519.099
sensitive I'm also freaking brilliant

2516.28 --> 2522.099
and I can literally blow your mind from

2519.099 --> 2525.04
your Vantage Point with whatever you

2522.099 --> 2527.92
have available for faculties and then I

2525.04 --> 2529.54
can give I can adapt my Brilliance to

2527.92 --> 2532.7200000000003
the individual

2529.54 --> 2535.0
to tell them exactly what they need to

2532.72 --> 2538.859
progress their Awakening

2535.0 --> 2538.859
or help their life in general

2539.14 --> 2547.06
right that sort of thing

2541.599 --> 2549.7000000000003
so yeah no I don't get threats and never

2547.06 --> 2553.0789999999997
and I have I'd like to think I have very

2549.7 --> 2553.0789999999997
good relations with the police

2554.079 --> 2560.32
they know who I am

2557.02 --> 2563.38
they know what I'm like they know that I

2560.32 --> 2565.0
do have certain issues that make me a

2563.38 --> 2568.6600000000003
little less flexible

2565.0 --> 2571.54
right homophobia B1

2568.66 --> 2574.2999999999997
right and being very passionate

2571.54 --> 2577.48
and outspoken

2574.3 --> 2579.88
like to save my life that I literally if

2577.48 --> 2582.76
I don't do that if I keep it in I'll

2579.88 --> 2585.04
probably end up actually hurting myself

2582.76 --> 2586.6600000000003
not even realizing it

2585.04 --> 2590.74
so yeah

2586.66 --> 2592.839
I am kind of an open profile person

2590.74 --> 2595.6189999999997
with all my

2592.839 --> 2599.5
conceivable

2595.619 --> 2601.42
downsides or handicaps whatever whether

2599.5 --> 2603.28
you want to see it like that or not I

2601.42 --> 2605.859
mean I leave it all open but I am an

2603.28 --> 2608.7400000000002
open profile guy literally nothing to

2605.859 --> 2611.56
hide but I mean literally nothing to

2608.74 --> 2613.5989999999997
hide even though there is a lot

2611.56 --> 2616.599
it's not I have nothing to hide because

2613.599 --> 2619.839
I'm so freaking boring and Bland

2616.599 --> 2621.099
it's just that I take a great amount of

2619.839 --> 2624.04
care

2621.099 --> 2626.26
to be able to be honest and open about

2624.04 --> 2629.68
everything

2626.26 --> 2631.7200000000003
always and to always know that somebody

2629.68 --> 2635.2599999999998
could have been recording me all this

2631.72 --> 2637.5989999999997
time in like 20 years non-stop without

2635.26 --> 2639.96
me knowing it and that it's perfectly

2637.599 --> 2639.96
fine

2640.48 --> 2644.92
I'm just really open and I think that

2643.359 --> 2647.2599999999998
everybody

2644.92 --> 2649.2400000000002
that has interacted with me has been

2647.26 --> 2651.76
very thankful for that

2649.24 --> 2655.18
because if it wouldn't be I'd probably

2651.76 --> 2656.6400000000003
be freaking intimidating to them

2655.18 --> 2661.3599999999997

2674.56 --> 2679.2999999999997

2677.26 --> 2681.7200000000003
like go [ __ ] yourself you're [ __ ]

2686.68 --> 2692.7999999999997
bigger than me I would [ __ ] torture

2689.68 --> 2696.22
you and you'd [ __ ] your pants and cry

2692.8 --> 2699.94
like a little baby you [ __ ]

2696.22 --> 2704.2799999999997
you don't know what strength is [ __ ]

2699.94 --> 2704.28
you [ __ ] little gamma piece of [ __ ]

2705.46 --> 2711.04
yeah

2707.94 --> 2714.04
but uh yeah this stuff has definitely

2711.04 --> 2716.8
happened yeah when Oppenheimer did his

2714.04 --> 2720.46
thing with the atom bomb roll out yeah

2716.8 --> 2721.8390000000004
it's officially on record people were

2720.46 --> 2726.18
killed

2721.839 --> 2726.18
killed by Secret Service

2726.64 --> 2737.74
no reason was given but it did happen

2733.26 --> 2740.3390000000004
officially registered you [ __ ]

2737.74 --> 2740.339
huh

2741.29 --> 2750.119
[Music]

2747.06 --> 2752.5
so my concerns are definitely

2750.119 --> 2754.359
legitimate not saying it is going to

2752.5 --> 2758.56
happen but it could happen if they're

2754.359 --> 2762.22
gonna bake a big big worldwide mind

2758.56 --> 2763.96
control move like the unroll of the atom

2762.22 --> 2765.9599999999996
bomb was

2763.96 --> 2769.859
then there is a chance they could pull

2765.96 --> 2772.54
Oppenheimer and we should be

2769.859 --> 2775.44
paying attention if that's actually

2772.54 --> 2775.44
happening or not

2780.4 --> 2795.819
[Music]

2794.26 --> 2797.8590000000004
right

2795.819 --> 2800.619
we have arrived to defend it yeah yeah

2797.859 --> 2803.5
but it's more than that because once I

2800.619 --> 2805.78
am gonna be forced to somehow defend

2803.5 --> 2808.119
myself with lethal Force

2805.78 --> 2810.52
that's actually going to lead to a much

2808.119 --> 2813.6400000000003
bigger thing that I've been trying to

2810.52 --> 2816.52
hold off my entire life

2813.64 --> 2818.2599999999998

gonna Strike Back

I'm not afraid it's gonna happen you see

3120.42 --> 3126.0
I've been doing this show this way for

3144.599 --> 3149.7000000000003
you're talking about

3146.4 --> 3152.7000000000003
I do not have persecution complex

3149.7 --> 3155.2799999999997
but I do have principles and I realize

3152.7 --> 3158.339
this world is getting more unstable

3155.28 --> 3162.6600000000003
and I have measures

3158.339 --> 3164.819
built for myself to deal with that if it

3162.66 --> 3166.74
were to happen yeah that's not

3164.819 --> 3169.98
persecution complex

3166.74 --> 3172.5589999999997
that's simply being prepared for a world

3169.98 --> 3173.4900000000002
that might go to hell huh

3172.559 --> 3178.0890000000004
[ __ ]

3173.49 --> 3178.089
[Music]

3183.42 --> 3187.559
you build up a whole scenario of

3185.52 --> 3190.8
something that is never gonna happen

3187.559 --> 3193.44
but yes yes you mean like a nuke

3190.8 --> 3196.38
destroying in the entire country

3193.44 --> 3199.319
I mean nobody's ever

3196.38 --> 3202.26
thought about what do you do if a new

3199.319 --> 3204.18
periods you except like even encouraged

3202.26 --> 3207.3590000000004
by the government to do that oh it's

3204.18 --> 3211.7999999999997
never happened though has it ever never

3207.359 --> 3213.14
ever never ever ever ever ever ever yeah

3211.8 --> 3217.8
ever

3213.14 --> 3220.0789999999997
so who's got the persecution complex

3217.8 --> 3221.4
who's got it

3220.079 --> 3225.059
yeah

3221.4 --> 3228.0
I mean I'm only going by basic scenarios

3225.059 --> 3229.2000000000003
that are literally being described as

3228.0 --> 3232.2
such

3229.2 --> 3233.8799999999997
in regular news articles

3232.2 --> 3236.16
yeah

3233.88 --> 3239.339
it's all over the place

3236.16 --> 3241.7999999999997
so I didn't make it up

3239.339 --> 3243.119
these are things that could happen

3241.8 --> 3244.8
there's things that are already

3243.119 --> 3247.1400000000003
happening in other countries yeah

3244.8 --> 3249.6600000000003
there's already videos of people getting

3247.14 --> 3251.7
forced vaccinated and such

3249.66 --> 3255.24
like with the handicapped kids and all

3251.7 --> 3257.46
that horrific monstrous yeah already

3255.24 --> 3260.64
happening on camera

3257.46 --> 3264.3
so yeah it can happen it's definitely

3260.64 --> 3266.46
not an unrealistic potential option for

3264.3 --> 3268.1600000000003
something that might happen and it is

3266.46 --> 3272.94
definitely not

3268.16 --> 3275.0989999999997
crazy to prepare mentally for what would

3272.94 --> 3277.5
you do if that would happen

3275.099 --> 3279.78
that's not a persecution complex that's

3277.5 --> 3283.92
called being prepared

3279.78 --> 3284.94
after getting warning signals to your

3283.92 --> 3290.48
face

3284.94 --> 3290.48
from journalists in the world huh

3294.96 --> 3298.98
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

3297.0 --> 3302.94

online filing my nails then interacting

3366.42 --> 3371.2200000000003
with these scumbags

3416.76 --> 3421.5200000000004
advantage

3418.68 --> 3421.52
only one

3421.98 --> 3428.819
of a Totally Tracked and traced

3425.599 --> 3431.6400000000003
controlled Society

3428.819 --> 3435.3
that is that well somebody that's

3431.64 --> 3437.5789999999997
actually in control would use it not

3435.3 --> 3439.6800000000003
just to enrich themselves and to make

3437.579 --> 3442.5
everybody [ __ ] just to protect

3439.68 --> 3445.44
themselves because they're so scared

3442.5 --> 3448.559
they could actually use it to socially

3445.44 --> 3452.76
engineer society and

3448.559 --> 3455.6400000000003
punish not based on political dissent or

3452.76 --> 3459.2400000000002
specific opinions

3455.64 --> 3462.14
but on behavioral quality

3459.24 --> 3462.14
huh

3462.18 --> 3467.359
how you're known to socially interact

3464.94 --> 3472.2000000000003
and it wouldn't be dependent on somebody

3467.359 --> 3473.5789999999997
he was mean to me he tried to hurt me no

3472.2 --> 3474.72
no no no no no no no

3473.579 --> 3477.38
it's just

3474.72 --> 3480.66
you being recorded

3477.38 --> 3482.88
interacting and the energy that you have

3480.66 --> 3485.22
while you do it yeah that can be

3482.88 --> 3487.92
measured it can all be measured yeah

3485.22 --> 3490.6189999999997
yeah and then you have like a mark like

3487.92 --> 3493.92
oh this is your output level

3490.619 --> 3496.319
oh you're kind of shitty

3493.92 --> 3498.7200000000003

3496.319 --> 3501.24
kind of a [ __ ] you don't really help

3498.72 --> 3503.22
other people you're not very bright you

3501.24 --> 3506.339
don't have very inspiring ideas you're

3503.22 --> 3511.5
not good for morale well guess what

3506.339 --> 3513.599
your credit score good tank really badly

3511.5 --> 3516.42
and then what's gonna happen you're

3513.599 --> 3519.1800000000003
gonna be in a shitty place

3516.42 --> 3520.559
and you deserve it because you're a

3519.18 --> 3524.0
piece of [ __ ]

3520.559 --> 3524.0
huh that could happen

3524.64 --> 3532.5
in fact if there is no chance to escape

3528.96 --> 3534.839
a information controlled society as it

3532.5 --> 3536.0
is rolling out it has been for like 20

3534.839 --> 3538.859
years

3536.0 --> 3542.52
then I will make sure

3538.859 --> 3543.839
to push the leadership to do it like

3542.52 --> 3545.839
that

[Music]

3555.66 --> 3561.18
thank you

3556.88 --> 3563.579
being a Jim Bob copycat

3561.18 --> 3567.74
dude

3563.579 --> 3572.3390000000004
I was doing Flat Earth live shows

3567.74 --> 3575.0989999999997
cheers before Jim Bob came on the scene

3572.339 --> 3579.74
the [ __ ] are you talking about dude

3575.099 --> 3579.7400000000002
I only know Jim Bob for like two years

3581.52 --> 3586.94
I've been at it for

3583.44 --> 3586.94
six or seven

3587.22 --> 3590.18
so

3593.099 --> 3598.319
and now I've attempt this they changed

3596.339 --> 3603.799
my stick

3598.319 --> 3603.799
up again how how am I copying it

3608.22 --> 3614.339
and you still have yeah yeah because I

3610.079 --> 3616.38
got a cap I got a cap on my on my Subs

3614.339 --> 3618.299
and besides I don't really want that

3616.38 --> 3620.7000000000003
much many Subs

3618.299 --> 3622.5
because if I get a lot more subs

3620.7 --> 3624.839
especially quickly that just usually

3622.5 --> 3628.22
means more retards that don't really

3624.839 --> 3628.22
have anything to contribute

3631.02 --> 3637.079
that's right Supreme knowing thanks for

3633.299 --> 3639.24
thanks for remembering yes I did

3637.079 --> 3641.28
I was talking about Flat Earth before

3639.24 --> 3644.0
Patricia steering came on the scene

3641.28 --> 3644.0
that's right

3645.42 --> 3649.619
Flat Earth talks 2016.

3654.66 --> 3659.0989999999997
I'm gonna put the Caps here why didn't

3656.76 --> 3661.619
they even talk about my Subs earlier

3659.099 --> 3663.1800000000003
well because I just keep track

3661.619 --> 3664.559
you know I keep track of whatever

3663.18 --> 3668.46
happens

3664.559 --> 3671.8190000000004
why because why not if I noticed like

3668.46 --> 3674.76
hey the sub went up a digit

3671.819 --> 3677.819
like one number then yeah

3674.76 --> 3679.619
I might say it or I might not because

3677.819 --> 3681.96
it's not that important but I just

3679.619 --> 3684.1800000000003
brought it up oh my God you think it's a

3681.96 --> 3685.92
conspiracy I think it's a conspiracy

3684.18 --> 3688.0789999999997
that I brought it up

3685.92 --> 3690.48
that I'm actually secretly super

3688.079 --> 3692.579
obsessed with my sub count

3690.48 --> 3697.319
no

3692.579 --> 3699.7200000000003
no I'm more concerned with my notoriety

3697.319 --> 3702.66
and familiarity

3699.72 --> 3704.9399999999996
that people know about me

3702.66 --> 3708.299
and they don't like they can hate me

3704.94 --> 3710.4
they can even avoid using my name but if

3708.299 --> 3713.819
I hear that somebody's been listening

3710.4 --> 3717.839
and adapting to my structural way of

3713.819 --> 3720.7799999999997
thinking and I will pick up on it

3717.839 --> 3724.88
and I think that my actual reach is a

3720.78 --> 3724.88
lot wider than just this YouTube channel

3734.39 --> 3738.0
[Music]

3741.44 --> 3745.28
hey clap rockers

3752.52 --> 3756.42

3754.079 --> 3759.7200000000003
about clap Ruckus with the Jim Bob like

3756.42 --> 3762.119
how the [ __ ] am I like Jim Bob

3759.72 --> 3764.2799999999997
I mean yeah he's very entertaining and

3762.119 --> 3768.119
he gets me going

3764.28 --> 3772.02
but Jim Bob has a whole different thing

3768.119 --> 3774.359
that he does he literally gets crazy

3772.02 --> 3776.88
people with their own channels that come

3774.359 --> 3779.7
on life and then pulls them in

3776.88 --> 3783.42
and lets them show them how crazy they

3779.7 --> 3786.8999999999996
are do I do that do I do that guys oh

3783.42 --> 3790.98

not jimba Jim Bob doesn't do that voice

3929.099 --> 3937.5
he does Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro

3933.319 --> 3941.94
and like Dawkins yeah those are his

3937.5 --> 3946.26
voices not you drink it with me that's

3941.94 --> 3948.54
Owen Benjamin you [ __ ] [ __ ] huh

3946.26 --> 3950.76
you even know the difference between

3948.54 --> 3954.42
these people

3950.76 --> 3957.98
do you have ears that can distinguish

3954.42 --> 3957.98
between sounds

3979.38 --> 3984.2400000000002
[ __ ]

3980.7 --> 3987.299
try to distinguish between people

3984.24 --> 3992.2799999999997
yeah no it's very hard to keep them

3987.299 --> 3996.0
apart oh and Benjamin Jim Bob Owen

3992.28 --> 3999.3590000000004
Benjamin Jim Bob I cannot tell the

3996.0 --> 4001.64
difference because I'm a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3999.359 --> 4006.2
oh

4001.64 --> 4006.2

4053.059 --> 4057.02
right

4054.5 --> 4059.18
but I learned to not just outright band

4057.02 --> 4062.0
people you got to give them a really

4059.18 --> 4063.74
harsh treatment and a giant kick in the

4062.0 --> 4065.66
ass before you abandon

4063.74 --> 4067.8799999999997
because if you ban them first and then

4065.66 --> 4069.74
you start doing that afterward it

4067.88 --> 4071.96
doesn't work as well

4069.74 --> 4075.2
you gotta leave them in tension before

4071.96 --> 4080.2
you kick them the [ __ ] out

4075.2 --> 4080.2
that way it actually hurts as they leave

4080.359 --> 4085.0389999999998
okay

4082.45 --> 4088.22
[Music]

4085.039 --> 4090.26
unless they have no nothing noteworthy

4088.22 --> 4093.5589999999997
or barely even an identity and then you

4090.26 --> 4096.22
just kick him and completely ignore him

4093.559 --> 4096.22

[Music]

4129.56 --> 4133.42
I think I got a title for today

4142.48 --> 4149.62
are there General personality types uh

4146.66 --> 4149.62
high five routes

4149.779 --> 4155.819
sort of

4151.62 --> 4155.8189999999995
[Music]

4157.819 --> 4163.52
look personality types are very

4160.219 --> 4165.92
difficult because there's like every

4163.52 --> 4167.779
person has like complete different

4165.92 --> 4171.259
layers

4167.779 --> 4173.540000000001
of every person is like a pyramid every

4171.259 --> 4176.12
single one and they got all these layers

4173.54 --> 4180.199
of characteristics some some of which

4176.12 --> 4182.96
are just completely locked off unlocked

4180.199 --> 4185.5599999999995
or very well developed and over focused

4182.96 --> 4185.56
on so

4186.279 --> 4193.400000000001
it's really difficult to over generalize

4189.5 --> 4196.219
a personality type but

4193.4 --> 4198.98
you can always just assemble different

4196.219 --> 4201.5
traits and then say like yeah it's a

4198.98 --> 4204.44
combination of that and that and that

4201.5 --> 4206.78
and one of these systems

4204.44 --> 4209.9
can be very useful that can be very

4206.78 --> 4211.34
useful for this type of analysis would

4209.9 --> 4215.12
be the

4211.34 --> 4216.14
social sexual hierarchy system hierarchy

4215.12 --> 4218.599999999999
system

4216.14 --> 4221.84
from Fox day

4218.6 --> 4224.6
that's where the gamma comes from an

4221.84 --> 4226.34
alpha beta

4224.6 --> 4227.75
uh

4226.34 --> 4229.04
and all the rest

4227.75 --> 4231.739
[Music]

4229.04 --> 4236.3
he basically figured that out and it's a

4231.739 --> 4239.12
very useful tool but if you are a gamma

4236.3 --> 4241.9400000000005
that does not mean that you

4239.12 --> 4245.719
are automatically a stereotype right so

4241.94 --> 4249.32
the the danger of using this within like

4245.719 --> 4253.76
yeah gamma beta

4249.32 --> 4256.4
or Omega all that [ __ ] if you're just

4253.76 --> 4259.1
gonna focus on those words you are going

4256.4 --> 4261.32
to over generalize

4259.1 --> 4263.4800000000005
because they are basically indicators

4261.32 --> 4266.239
they're directions

4263.48 --> 4267.98
that a person is at

4266.239 --> 4270.799999999999
that doesn't mean that they cannot

4267.98 --> 4275.299999999999
change Beyond it

4270.8 --> 4277.96
right a gamma's can typically turn into

4275.3 --> 4277.96
deltas

4279.739 --> 4284.9
for example so more

4282.699 --> 4286.9
encouraging potential Transformations

4284.9 --> 4289.219
that is possible

4286.9 --> 4293.54
[Music]

4289.219 --> 4298.4
I hear gamma quite often Gammas are

4293.54 --> 4300.38
Gammas uh God Gammas are just like

4298.4 --> 4301.94
combination of basically a lot of

4300.38 --> 4305.12
terrible traits

4301.94 --> 4307.219
cover this egomania

4305.12 --> 4309.199
paranoia

4307.219 --> 4311.06
cocking

4309.199 --> 4314.12
and lying

4311.06 --> 4316.6990000000005
like false pretense that is like those

4314.12 --> 4318.92
are basically the worst combined traits

4316.699 --> 4322.159
of the gamma

4318.92 --> 4324.5
it's what makes somebody stand out as a

4322.159 --> 4327.259999999999
gamma if they have these traits and they

4324.5 --> 4329.659
really like throw it out in the open I

4327.26 --> 4331.280000000001
mean a gamma cannot hide that they are a

4329.659 --> 4333.92
gamma

4331.28 --> 4336.139999999999
just like an alpha cannot hide that they

4333.92 --> 4338.62
are an alpha

4336.14 --> 4338.62
right

4340.699 --> 4345.32
and a Delta

4343.28 --> 4346.759999999999
well they can hide that they're a Delta

4345.32 --> 4349.4
but

4346.76 --> 4351.860000000001
because it might be more effective too

4349.4 --> 4354.32
right because for Delta being effective

4351.86 --> 4357.0199999999995
is really like one of the core

4354.32 --> 4359.98
principles that drives it drives the

4357.02 --> 4359.9800000000005
Delta formation

4362.36 --> 4367.339999999999
right but if you really want to know the

4365.179 --> 4369.7390000000005
details about it I think that

4367.34 --> 4373.46
fox day actually wrote a book about it

4369.739 --> 4376.459999999999
that he he made in his printing presses

4373.46 --> 4379.59
you can actually buy that I think

4376.46 --> 4382.789
so there is a book about it I think

4379.59 --> 4382.789
[Music]

4386.659 --> 4394.28
do gamma suffer from chronic nice guy

4389.3 --> 4397.88
syndromes no absolutely not

4394.28 --> 4401.62
now chronic nice guy syndrome is

4397.88 --> 4401.62
definitely a Delta trait

4409.699 --> 4415.239
right

4410.9 --> 4415.239
Gammas are not submissive

4416.54 --> 4423.219
and the thing about Gammas typically

4419.42 --> 4423.219
want to be an alpha but they can't

4425.78 --> 4430.54
they don't have it in them but they are

4427.699 --> 4432.08
they obsess over it

4430.54 --> 4433.6
[Music]

4432.08 --> 4437.489
foreign

4433.6 --> 4437.4890000000005
[Music]

4438.4 --> 4443.839999999999
Well yeah if you call somebody a gamma

4441.08 --> 4444.98
that's pretty detrimental that doesn't

4443.84 --> 4447.02
mean that

4444.98 --> 4449.0599999999995
there are people out there that have

4447.02 --> 4450.8
gamma traits

4449.06 --> 4453.5
but that still haven't kind of under

4450.8 --> 4456.679
control there is like

4453.5 --> 4458.6
a whole set of stages between gamma and

4456.679 --> 4462.1990000000005
Delta somebody can be hanging in between

4458.6 --> 4464.96
a gamma and a delta or they're like

4462.199 --> 4468.139999999999
gamma recoveries turning into Deltas

4464.96 --> 4470.4800000000005
basically hopefully but hey Delta can

4468.14 --> 4472.159000000001
fall back into being a gamma again they

4470.48 --> 4474.08
can look feel like they lose everything

4472.159 --> 4476.179
and then they let themselves go and turn

4474.08 --> 4477.32
straight back into a gamma that can

4476.179 --> 4480.679
happen

4477.32 --> 4483.38
right because a gamma also has a lot of

4480.679 --> 4485.3
internal preoccupation they have a lot

4483.38 --> 4487.219
of distractions in themselves they

4485.3 --> 4489.070000000001
basically utilize their own intelligence

4487.219 --> 4490.9
to distract them a lot

4489.07 --> 4493.58
[Music]

4490.9 --> 4494.96
how is the Sigma different from an alpha

4493.58 --> 4497.8
I don't know I don't really understand

4494.96 --> 4497.8
the sigma

4500.48 --> 4504.199
I am not super familiar with the whole

4503.3 --> 4507.320000000001
thing

4504.199 --> 4510.62
I what I learned I learned through

4507.32 --> 4514.96
Word of Mouth from Fox and from

4510.62 --> 4514.96
uh from Owen Benjamin

4515.06 --> 4519.620000000001
and I think I get the gist of the Alpha

4517.64 --> 4522.14
and the beta

4519.62 --> 4526.76
and the gamma and the Delta but the

4522.14 --> 4526.76
others is like what okay

4528.32 --> 4533.299999999999
I don't really get it

4530.36 --> 4537.38
the sigma is like Owen always says it's

4533.3 --> 4539.78
like a James Bond type figure

4537.38 --> 4542.08
like they're Alpha but they're not in

4539.78 --> 4542.08
the open

4542.6 --> 4547.88
and omegas I don't get it all I don't

4545.659 --> 4550.219
I'd have to like read into that or

4547.88 --> 4552.62
something I have not gone into a lot of

4550.219 --> 4554.719
detail with those others but the

4552.62 --> 4557.2
primaries

4554.719 --> 4561.21
from alpha to Delta I get

4557.2 --> 4561.21
[Music]

4563.239 --> 4568.218999999999
you just follow your gut feeling well

4565.64 --> 4571.9400000000005
following your gut feeling is typically

4568.219 --> 4574.659
an alpha trait or beta I mean Alpha and

4571.94 --> 4579.08
beta can be very close to one another

4574.659 --> 4581.839999999999
right oh Benjamin is a beta but

4579.08 --> 4584.12
he's acting like an alpha but that's

4581.84 --> 4586.78
because of his role that's because he

4584.12 --> 4586.78
kind of has to

4588.5 --> 4594.26
but he is naturally a beta so he likes

4591.8 --> 4598.179
to serve a strong man a stronger figure

4594.26 --> 4598.179
than himself that's in him

4598.219 --> 4602.78
I used to have that too but I've

4600.739 --> 4606.699
actually figured out that I'm probably

4602.78 --> 4606.699
more Alpha than beta

4608.78 --> 4614.12
I I but if there's somebody really

4611.96 --> 4617.54
awesome especially if they're really

4614.12 --> 4620.0
good at something and they get me then I

4617.54 --> 4622.179
can that really brings out the Delta I

4620.0 --> 4622.179
mean

4623.84 --> 4628.82
but yeah I mean on Nathan's show I'm a

4627.5 --> 4631.94
beta

4628.82 --> 4635.48
definitely a beta and when I get Baldwin

4631.94 --> 4638.36
I'm a Delta not a Gamma Delta very much

4635.48 --> 4639.719999999999
Bowen is a delta

4638.36 --> 4643.599999999999
I hope you guys get that

4639.72 --> 4643.6
[Music]

4643.82 --> 4651.139999999999
right but I I kind of grew up very much

4646.46 --> 4655.1
gamma and beta in my life also Delta but

4651.14 --> 4659.02
a lot of gamma too it's problematic

4655.1 --> 4659.02
and got rid of a lot of that

4660.199 --> 4666.32
but it's so weird because I really did

4663.14 --> 4668.360000000001
want to be a leader but then as soon as

4666.32 --> 4669.92
I realized like how much effort that

4668.36 --> 4671.9
actually as soon as I got honest with it

4669.92 --> 4672.9800000000005
is like oh no I don't actually want to

4671.9 --> 4676.04
do that

4672.98 --> 4679.459999999999
and that's basically yeah that

4676.04 --> 4682.4
helped me to retract from my gamma

4679.46 --> 4684.44
Tendencies and now

4682.4 --> 4687.139999999999
it's a it's a growing process that's

4684.44 --> 4691.389999999999
been going for a very very long time

4687.14 --> 4693.5
it's a freaking hiccups where

4691.39 --> 4697.1
[Music]

4693.5 --> 4699.5
I'm just noticing more and more of that

4697.1 --> 4701.6
I don't want to be an alpha I'm

4699.5 --> 4705.38
effectively not an alpha right now

4701.6 --> 4707.780000000001
except verbally maybe a little to some I

4705.38 --> 4710.719
don't know I don't I'm not sure

4707.78 --> 4714.0199999999995
but I feel like yeah I maybe I will need

4710.719 --> 4717.94
to be an alpha at some point just to

4714.02 --> 4717.9400000000005
just to deal with this world

4718.1 --> 4725.92
maybe they really need a leader like an

4721.58 --> 4725.92
actual actual spiritual leader

4727.4 --> 4730.239
I don't know

4731.96 --> 4739.94
I still have issues I mean I am not like

4735.94 --> 4743.419999999999
constitutionally like my body is not the

4739.94 --> 4745.58
most suitable for like a strong leader

4743.42 --> 4749.0
cause I am

4745.58 --> 4752.3
sensitive and I get over stressed

4749.0 --> 4753.56
relatively easy despite lifelong

4752.3 --> 4756.320000000001
training

4753.56 --> 4758.900000000001
and when you're an actual leader and

4756.32 --> 4761.179
there's action you need to be able to

4758.9 --> 4762.32
deal with that tension without any

4761.179 --> 4764.54
issues

4762.32 --> 4768.0199999999995
so I might simply never be able to

4764.54 --> 4771.219
attain a true alpha position just

4768.02 --> 4771.219
because of my Constitution

4773.659 --> 4779.0199999999995
does Delta have any attributes of an

4776.239 --> 4779.0199999999995
alpha no

4780.38 --> 4785.2390000000005
no that's actually that's gamma

4783.08 --> 4789.0199999999995
tendencies

4785.239 --> 4791.959999999999
the Delta can dream about being an alpha

4789.02 --> 4795.34
but that's actually the gamma

4791.96 --> 4795.34
side that does that

4796.219 --> 4800.36
right and Alpha doesn't

4799.1 --> 4802.58
keep

4800.36 --> 4804.199
their Tendencies to themselves that's

4802.58 --> 4807.32
the point

4804.199 --> 4809.96
you're just now you just do it that's

4807.32 --> 4812.0599999999995
the point about an alpha you just do it

4809.96 --> 4814.28
and you got the momentum and everybody

4812.06 --> 4816.679
loves it and everybody wants you to have

4814.28 --> 4819.8
it and they want you to be their strong

4816.679 --> 4821.84
man that's a real Alpha you just do it

4819.8 --> 4823.46
you don't think about it you don't keep

4821.84 --> 4826.1
it secret

4823.46 --> 4829.6
the alphas are in your face every time

4826.1 --> 4829.6
even when it's inconvenient

4830.49 --> 4842.0
[Music]

4835.64 --> 4846.6
is it not fox day yes but it's day a why

4842.0 --> 4849.829
it's not day no well tries

4846.6 --> 4849.829000000001
[Music]

4864.14 --> 4868.400000000001
right

4865.76 --> 4871.04
and by the way a lot of your questions

4868.4 --> 4875.48
that you're asking now about it I am

4871.04 --> 4878.3
kind of basing my answers on my insight

4875.48 --> 4880.218999999999
as what I figured out so far I mean if

4878.3 --> 4882.9800000000005
I'd have a conversation like this with

4880.219 --> 4885.159
like fox day if you haven't want to have

4882.98 --> 4887.4
a conversation with me

4885.159 --> 4888.94
I'm probably way too

4887.4 --> 4890.48
[Music]

4888.94 --> 4892.4
energetic

4890.48 --> 4895.879999999999
for him

4892.4 --> 4897.5599999999995
but he'd probably like correct me on a

4895.88 --> 4900.4400000000005
whole bunch of things I mean he

4897.56 --> 4903.02
basically figured out that system

4900.44 --> 4905.0599999999995
put a lot of effort in it and he

4903.02 --> 4907.179
obviously understands it better than I

4905.06 --> 4907.179
do

4908.0 --> 4913.28
so yeah some of the things that I

4909.92 --> 4916.159
explained I might be slightly off

4913.28 --> 4917.7699999999995
but I think I got a pretty decent grasp

4916.159 --> 4926.839999999999
of it

4917.77 --> 4926.84
[Music]

4933.02 --> 4939.56
I'm a hundred percent better than him

4936.199 --> 4941.9
okay soccer I might be better in social

4939.56 --> 4944.56
communication interaction I mean he

4941.9 --> 4947.839999999999
doesn't seem he he's like not a

4944.56 --> 4949.820000000001
extrovert guy he's an introvert and he's

4947.84 --> 4952.52
staying that way

4949.82 --> 4954.259999999999
right so yeah he doesn't debate he

4952.52 --> 4955.76
wouldn't know he wouldn't want to deal

4954.26 --> 4958.1
with it even

4955.76 --> 4961.34
and I'm better at it than than him with

4958.1 --> 4965.719
that absolutely I know I am

4961.34 --> 4968.659000000001
you can't stand him I totally get that

4965.719 --> 4971.06
I get it I I really get it I mean I he's

4968.659 --> 4974.78
not a perfect guy

4971.06 --> 4977.120000000001
he has like very weird issues in his own

4974.78 --> 4980.48
way taste issues and it's just but

4977.12 --> 4985.34
that's him the but the point is he is

4980.48 --> 4988.599999999999
very smart he is very creative and

4985.34 --> 4992.0
not just mentally creative he actually

4988.6 --> 4994.52
is very active he actually does things

4992.0 --> 4995.9
he makes books he has a printing press

4994.52 --> 4998.96
dude

4995.9 --> 5001.0599999999995
he's like somebody that actually makes a

4998.96 --> 5004.36
lot of things I am much more of a

5001.06 --> 5007.179
theorist I don't really build things a

5004.36 --> 5010.179
lot I build ideas

5007.179 --> 5011.86
and I build language skill and I build

5010.179 --> 5013.719
confidence

5011.86 --> 5015.58
that's the type of thing that I do I'm

5013.719 --> 5018.719
much more well psychology or type

5015.58 --> 5020.98
psychologist theorist

5018.719 --> 5022.719
theoretical physicists which is kind of

5020.98 --> 5026.62
like paradoxical but

5022.719 --> 5030.42
that's what I am he is not that not at

5026.62 --> 5033.4
all no he is a writer Fox

5030.42 --> 5036.1
writes he is a writer

5033.4 --> 5042.659
he knows how to create and assemble

5036.1 --> 5042.659000000001
stories and Graft in real intelligence

5042.699 --> 5046.678999999999
and like

5044.8 --> 5051.400000000001
social

5046.679 --> 5054.04
societal issues that are very now and

5051.4 --> 5056.259999999999
then integrate them great he's good at

5054.04 --> 5059.26
that really good

5056.26 --> 5061.659000000001
really practiced a lot

5059.26 --> 5062.7390000000005
so he's just a very different guy than I

5061.659 --> 5065.44
am

5062.739 --> 5068.62
but I really do respect some of the

5065.44 --> 5071.08
things that he's written like his system

5068.62 --> 5072.88
of the social sexual hierarchy I really

5071.08 --> 5075.34
appreciate that

5072.88 --> 5078.64
I think that's definitely like something

5075.34 --> 5079.96
I will I agree yeah he deserves respect

5078.64 --> 5081.990000000001
for that

5079.96 --> 5087.159
absolutely

5081.99 --> 5090.04
[Music]

5087.159 --> 5093.58
he's so no he is on Flat Earth dude

5090.04 --> 5096.1
Godzilla he knows dude

5093.58 --> 5098.08
he's literally partnered

5096.1 --> 5100.360000000001
with Owen Benjamin

5098.08 --> 5103.86
he knows the Earth is flat he just

5100.36 --> 5103.86
doesn't really want to talk about it

5104.08 --> 5109.32
to these yes this too distracting for

5106.78 --> 5109.32
what he does

5111.52 --> 5114.96
so don't downplay him

5127.48 --> 5130.259999999999
hmm

5138.46 --> 5144.219
right but yeah only the lonely Fox date

5140.98 --> 5147.0599999999995
is not a flat earther

5144.219 --> 5147.06
like that

5147.76 --> 5151.84
is his own man

5149.739 --> 5154.299999999999
he has a printing press

5151.84 --> 5156.82
he's a science fiction writer and comic

5154.3 --> 5159.46
book publisher and

5156.82 --> 5163.48
all kinds of things

5159.46 --> 5166.9
he's a historian philosopher

5163.48 --> 5168.699
like he knows all those works like and

5166.9 --> 5171.04
he really knows them

5168.699 --> 5174.239
not just on the surface

5171.04 --> 5177.42
so he's a very smart

5174.239 --> 5177.419999999999
well-studied man

5177.88 --> 5183.219
that doesn't make him super likable

5180.159 --> 5185.7699999999995
necessary but you gotta respect where

5183.219 --> 5190.7390000000005
respect is deserved

5185.77 --> 5190.7390000000005
[Music]

5191.38 --> 5197.1990000000005
cool cool grandfather brother out of

5195.04 --> 5199.48
printing press that's awesome that's

5197.199 --> 5201.219
really cool

5199.48 --> 5203.5
I mean

5201.219 --> 5205.78
yeah

5203.5 --> 5209.38
it would be pretty cool to have like

5205.78 --> 5211.719
access to one I mean I have stuff

5209.38 --> 5214.36
I have stuff a lot of papers and

5211.719 --> 5217.1
drawings and like it would be pretty

5214.36 --> 5218.799999999999
cool if I could just kind of make my

5217.1 --> 5222.76
[Music]

5218.8 --> 5226.2390000000005
some of my work even as Ross catches an

5222.76 --> 5229.780000000001
unfinished stories and just put it in a

5226.239 --> 5231.94
book just like that just just like that

5229.78 --> 5234.46
that would be read very cool

5231.94 --> 5238.12
but yeah for starters I would really

5234.46 --> 5241.06
kind of like to at some point have my

5238.12 --> 5242.739
trolls and tyrants game

5241.06 --> 5245.1990000000005
Rules book

5242.739 --> 5247.36
of like a thousand pages that it is I'd

5245.199 --> 5249.159
love to have that in an actual printed

5247.36 --> 5251.5199999999995
book at some point I originally wanted

5249.159 --> 5251.5199999999995
that

5255.88 --> 5260.32
right but yeah that's gonna be an

5258.1 --> 5263.38
investment and I'll probably never get

5260.32 --> 5267.599999999999
any money out of it back

5263.38 --> 5267.6
so I would do it more for the love of it

5269.679 --> 5276.4890000000005
anyway

5270.33 --> 5276.489
[Music]

5291.06 --> 5296.04
well interesting psych bear I never

5293.5 --> 5296.04
heard of that

foreign

5314.91 --> 5323.47
[Music]

5325.54 --> 5331.679
the title certainly made the trolls [ __ ]

5328.48 --> 5331.678999999999
off that's nice

5349.05 --> 5352.109
[Music]

5356.98 --> 5361.379999999999
right man time has flown

5361.96 --> 5365.58
probably got 10 more minutes

5377.76 --> 5382.3
hope you guys are enjoying the show have

5380.5 --> 5385.38
enjoyed the show except for the trolls

5382.3 --> 5385.38
they could go [ __ ] themselves

5395.739 --> 5399.178999999999
is Nemo still here

5399.88 --> 5405.6
maybe listening in the background I mean

5402.159 --> 5405.599999999999
we did get pretty heavy here

5409.9 --> 5414.699
and sorry about that but yeah when

5412.06 --> 5416.56
trolls get in I I gotta get rough with

5414.699 --> 5418.659
them I just have to

5416.56 --> 5420.6990000000005
don't want to

5418.659 --> 5424.379999999999
I'm not trying to

5420.699 --> 5424.379999999999
well I hope you get it

5424.48 --> 5429.58
but I guess that just being really harsh

5426.88 --> 5432.46
on trolls and getting a little rough

5429.58 --> 5437.1
in language is not the same as just

5432.46 --> 5437.1
being smutty and gross so

5438.46 --> 5443.44
you shared this show on seven platforms

5441.58 --> 5445.6
really

5443.44 --> 5448.36
what platforms

5445.6 --> 5451.5
where did you share it

5448.36 --> 5451.5
thank you by the way

5454.239 --> 5458.5599999999995
do you get any positive feedback there

5456.46 --> 5460.86
like hey this is interesting from other

5458.56 --> 5460.860000000001
people

5464.08 --> 5466.26
thank you

5479.699 --> 5486.339999999999
Facebook ah

5482.26 --> 5489.219
I have one like there whoo yeah I am not

5486.34 --> 5492.1
a great fan of Facebook though

5489.219 --> 5496.4800000000005
because they tend to like claim

5492.1 --> 5499.54
ownership of whatever you post on it

5496.48 --> 5502.78
so let it be known that I do not give

5499.54 --> 5505.199
Facebook permission to take ownership of

5502.78 --> 5508.179
any material that concerns my person

5505.199 --> 5511.54
whether it be in voice

5508.179 --> 5513.76
or whether it be an appearance

5511.54 --> 5515.739
you do not have permission to do

5513.76 --> 5518.92
anything with that ever

5515.739 --> 5521.86
so if anybody for some reason would post

5518.92 --> 5524.56
a link to this show or something

5521.86 --> 5528.219
on the Facebook platform

5524.56 --> 5529.6
that is not my action nor do I yeah nor

5528.219 --> 5531.42
does it give

5529.6 --> 5534.280000000001
Facebook

5531.42 --> 5538.06
my personal

5534.28 --> 5541.0199999999995
statement permission to take my material

5538.06 --> 5541.02
from me

5541.54 --> 5547.3
I would never post something on Facebook

5544.6 --> 5550.120000000001
but if somebody else does with my

5547.3 --> 5552.28
material and then I still do not give

5550.12 --> 5554.86
them ownership over it

5552.28 --> 5557.08
right they might claim it anyway but let

5554.86 --> 5559.299999999999
it be known that I do not that I

5557.08 --> 5561.28
officially do not give them permission

5559.3 --> 5563.08
to take ownership over any of my

5561.28 --> 5567.84
material

5563.08 --> 5567.84
be it auditory or visual

5568.659 --> 5574.929999999999
right but share it fine I'm not gonna

5572.02 --> 5578.909000000001
share it there but you can do it

5574.93 --> 5578.909000000001
[Music]

5579.76 --> 5585.719
right but what other platforms or is it

5583.179 --> 5585.719
all on Facebook

5586.719 --> 5591.42
Discord and Telegram

5588.94 --> 5591.419999999999
pray

5601.679 --> 5607.96
I wonder how long it's going to take

5604.239 --> 5611.62
before Zuckerberg realized that renaming

5607.96 --> 5613.78
Facebook into meta was like the dumbest

5611.62 --> 5616.599999999999
decision ever

5613.78 --> 5617.739
because literally everybody still calls

5616.6 --> 5620.9800000000005
it Facebook

5617.739 --> 5622.659
without even realizing like oh wait wait

5620.98 --> 5625.0599999999995
it's not called that and like nobody

5622.659 --> 5627.04
cares it's Facebook it's always going to

5625.06 --> 5629.56
be Facebook and calling it something

5627.04 --> 5631.9
else was the dumbest [ __ ] thing you

5629.56 --> 5634.120000000001
could ever do

5631.9 --> 5637.48
like is so dumb

5634.12 --> 5641.92
that people are just ignoring it

5637.48 --> 5645.94
okay it's that dumb

5641.92 --> 5647.86
yeah We're not gonna call it meta we're

5645.94 --> 5650.98
just gonna call it Facebook

5647.86 --> 5654.699
so if you are have a half a lick a sense

5650.98 --> 5656.86
you're gonna turn back that decision and

5654.699 --> 5659.58
just call it Facebook again you little

5656.86 --> 5659.58
freak

5659.92 --> 5662.639
uh

5667.84 --> 5675.179
impairment company I'm sure yeah but

5670.78 --> 5675.179
they they do use it on the logo right

5676.78 --> 5683.739
is it still good oh

5679.96 --> 5685.96
okay I thought that he literally renamed

5683.739 --> 5688.36
Facebook into meta

5685.96 --> 5690.78
then again I never really went there to

5688.36 --> 5690.78
check it

5691.0 --> 5696.159
okay fine

5693.88 --> 5698.400000000001
in that case yeah whatever it's still

5696.159 --> 5698.4
Facebook

5700.48 --> 5706.138999999999
meta is also VR well yeah the metaverse

5703.84 --> 5706.139
thing

5708.639 --> 5716.38
but it's like totally totally a dud

5713.92 --> 5719.7390000000005
so maybe that's how he did it he just

5716.38 --> 5723.159000000001
created meta as a parent company under

5719.739 --> 5724.599999999999
which Facebook becomes this subsidiary a

5723.159 --> 5726.638999999999
part of it

5724.6 --> 5729.6990000000005
in the hopes that he could create the

5726.639 --> 5733.4400000000005
meta verse but that's it's all failing I

5729.699 --> 5733.44
mean it's a disaster guys

5734.32 --> 5740.5199999999995
it's really failing

5737.49 --> 5740.5199999999995
[Music]

5744.639 --> 5749.679
all right I even addressed that like

5747.219 --> 5753.88
a while ago it's because of the timing

5749.679 --> 5756.28
it was just so dumb to do it right then

5753.88 --> 5759.52
doesn't work you can't present a whole

5756.28 --> 5762.04
new virtual space

5759.52 --> 5765.040000000001
in a time when when there's

5762.04 --> 5766.9
economic downturn and lots of misery it

5765.04 --> 5770.32
doesn't work

5766.9 --> 5774.099999999999
it only works rolling out a new medium

5770.32 --> 5776.38
to play in when things are good when

5774.1 --> 5778.54
it's upturn when they're suddenly oh

5776.38 --> 5781.78
more jobs oh we got more payment oh we

5778.54 --> 5785.26
got more time on our hands that's when

5781.78 --> 5788.38
URL out a new virtual medium and so

5785.26 --> 5791.139
literally Mark Zuckerberg could not have

5788.38 --> 5793.54
had a worse timing in rolling out the

5791.139 --> 5795.52
metaverse it was like literally the

5793.54 --> 5796.659
worst possible timing you could ever do

5795.52 --> 5800.46
such a thing

5796.659 --> 5800.46
and that's why it's failing

5802.37 --> 5810.96
[Music]

5808.42 --> 5810.96
okay

5812.08 --> 5816.0599999999995
well at least Google's just called

5813.699 --> 5816.0599999999995
Google

5817.48 --> 5822.82
but I guess that in the near future it's

5820.06 --> 5825.639
all just going to be owned by BlackRock

5822.82 --> 5827.98
and Vanguard

5825.639 --> 5831.04
that will be like the

5827.98 --> 5834.5199999999995
parent company Overlord of all companies

5831.04 --> 5837.42
or at least that's what they want to try

5834.52 --> 5837.42
officially

5837.57 --> 5841.78
[Music]

5839.56 --> 5844.179
yeah second life more popular yeah

5841.78 --> 5847.36
because they rolled it out at the

5844.179 --> 5849.639
perfect time they roll it out when there

5847.36 --> 5852.159
was an upturn when it was good

5849.639 --> 5853.84
when I was like yeah new development and

5852.159 --> 5856.48
there's like oh we got a lot of money to

5853.84 --> 5857.9800000000005
waste on Virtual nonsense where we can

5856.48 --> 5859.0
look even more rich

5857.98 --> 5860.799999999999
yeah

5859.0 --> 5863.44
it's the perfect timing that's why it

5860.8 --> 5867.04
worked that's got the people pulled in

5863.44 --> 5868.96
invested then they're in there invested

5867.04 --> 5871.36
trying to show off because they're

5868.96 --> 5873.699
invested right that's how it keeps

5871.36 --> 5876.28
together if you're gonna roll it out in

5873.699 --> 5879.4
a time of misery and economic downturn

5876.28 --> 5880.78
in depression nobody's gonna want to get

5879.4 --> 5883.78
in there

5880.78 --> 5887.199
and then maintain it for to pull other

5883.78 --> 5889.42
people it's just a giant dud it's stupid

5887.199 --> 5891.219
it doesn't work

5889.42 --> 5893.92
people are gonna get in and I've heard

5891.219 --> 5896.08
this story to get in and they just get

5893.92 --> 5898.36
really bored

5896.08 --> 5899.98
very quickly

5898.36 --> 5902.0199999999995
it's just like

5899.98 --> 5904.48
oh yeah it was a half hour in there and

5902.02 --> 5907.4800000000005
then just like yeah whatever I'll just

5904.48 --> 5910.48
go back to playing regular video games

5907.48 --> 5910.48
right

5910.84 --> 5918.400000000001
because it's the worst timing ever

5914.699 --> 5921.759999999999
right now once you get timing right then

5918.4 --> 5925.659
even after economic downturns after that

5921.76 --> 5927.34
it's still gonna be there because just

5925.659 --> 5929.159
like with second life there will be

5927.34 --> 5934.139
because of the right timing people

5929.159 --> 5934.138999999999
invested in it to keep it alive

5935.16 --> 5942.82
[Music]

5940.48 --> 5946.239
this in Second Life

5942.82 --> 5948.58
property designing furniture

5946.239 --> 5949.54
well but those are actually all virtual

5948.58 --> 5951.88
though

5949.54 --> 5956.34
that's virtual stuff virtual cars

5951.88 --> 5956.34
virtual dresses virtual furniture

5957.88 --> 5965.28
virtual carpets I mean I I know a girl

5962.38 --> 5969.52
from Eastern Europe

5965.28 --> 5972.28
Moldavia that actually designs dresses

5969.52 --> 5974.52
for a second life really good ones by

5972.28 --> 5974.5199999999995
the way

5974.56 --> 5978.820000000001
so it's all virtual in there

5976.78 --> 5980.5599999999995
I mean as soon as there would be real

5978.82 --> 5983.08
business in there yeah that would get

5980.56 --> 5984.76
weird they could do it man they could do

5983.08 --> 5987.58
it I mean

5984.76 --> 5990.9400000000005
why not in a way

5987.58 --> 5993.699
right you have a virtual place with a

5990.94 --> 5998.08
virtual business it's like yeah we sell

5993.699 --> 6000.419999999999
virtual carpets here look how beautiful

5998.08 --> 6003.6
would you perhaps like one of these

6000.42 --> 6006.12
carpets in real life

6003.6 --> 6009.0
well here we have

6006.12 --> 6010.92
the shop where we actually have these

6009.0 --> 6012.659
carpets on which these digital versions

6010.92 --> 6015.96
are based see

6012.659 --> 6018.0599999999995
they could do that why not well maybe

6015.96 --> 6020.52
business implications would become a

6018.06 --> 6024.360000000001
little complicated then tax and whatever

6020.52 --> 6025.75
but I mean it could be possible I would

6024.36 --> 6027.0
think that would be pretty awesome

6025.75 --> 6029.88
[Music]

6027.0 --> 6032.04
right a virtual store where you can buy

6029.88 --> 6034.62
virtual things but also the real

6032.04 --> 6037.739
versions of it wouldn't that be cool

6034.62 --> 6040.86
[Music]

6037.739 --> 6043.259999999999
I mean I would be pretty stoked if I got

6040.86 --> 6046.259999999999
like oh look I got like the most badass

6043.26 --> 6049.02
carpet in my little apartment in this

6046.26 --> 6051.780000000001
virtual world and look now I got the

6049.02 --> 6054.06
real carpet right there that wouldn't

6051.78 --> 6055.38
that be awesome right that's just one

6054.06 --> 6057.06
example

6055.38 --> 6059.9400000000005
right

6057.06 --> 6063.06
I mean who wouldn't like that

6059.94 --> 6065.94
that's into online [ __ ] like that right

6063.06 --> 6068.159000000001
