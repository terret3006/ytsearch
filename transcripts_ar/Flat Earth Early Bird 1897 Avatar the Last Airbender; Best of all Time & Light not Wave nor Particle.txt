actually nice and warm no heater

200.76 --> 203.599
necessary or

207.08 --> 212.59900000000002
anything right I'm not entirely sure by

209.439 --> 214.239
the way of about the whole time thing I

212.599 --> 217.67999999999998
I

214.239 --> 217.68
expected the

217.959 --> 224.12
uh the time to

221.159 --> 226.84
switch but I feel it

224.12 --> 230.76
didn't so maybe that's taking another

226.84 --> 230.76
week I'm not entirely sure what's going

235.12 --> 242.48000000000002
on you guys from yeah United States and

239.519 --> 247.72
all that could tell me I see just top

242.48 --> 247.72
popups that are typically

249.72 --> 254.64
from shows in the United States that

254.76 --> 260.68
happen at 300 p.m.

258.759 --> 264.8
normally

260.68 --> 264.8
so yeah that was a bit

266.41 --> 271.72
[Music]

268.72 --> 271.72
unexpected

271.759 --> 277.08000000000004
if so I might have

274.27 --> 279.75899999999996
[Music]

290.28 --> 294.4
to switch back an

294.96 --> 301.63899999999995
hour this coming week as well I thought

298.639 --> 301.639
that it would have switched

301.8 --> 305.479
per default but it didn't

311.639 --> 316.56
apparently

313.88 --> 319.24
right so

316.56 --> 320.44
yeah had a bit of a late night again

319.24 --> 326.6

391.24 --> 394.449
[Music]

402.639 --> 407.24
anyway

404.36 --> 411.72
yesterday finished watching the Netflix

407.24 --> 413.599
avatar the Last air bender first season

411.72 --> 418.40000000000003
series and it

413.599 --> 420.039
was yeah it did roughly follow the story

418.4 --> 424.28
the original story

420.039 --> 427.24
but it was all just very yeah it was

424.28 --> 430.599
great I like the series I arguably like

427.24 --> 430.599
it more than the original

435.16 --> 439.56
cartoon and I'm really looking forward

437.479 --> 442.52
to more because it's obviously just the

439.56 --> 445.479
first season and there's probably going

442.52 --> 448.52
to be two or three more of those and

445.479 --> 451.52
looking forward to that a

448.52 --> 451.52
lot

466.08 --> 470.68
right yeah yesterday I was hanging

468.72 --> 474.47900000000004
around

470.68 --> 474.479
on what's that called

477.8 --> 483.56
again Earth awak

481.4 --> 486.4
channel on

483.56 --> 489.639
Discord and had like pretty good

486.4 --> 489.63899999999995
conversations there it was

492.08 --> 499.039
interesting hope it's better than the M

494.639 --> 502.36
dude you cannot compare it like it is

499.039 --> 505.36
completely uncomparable

502.36 --> 508.44
it is much better

505.36 --> 512.519
like everybody hated the movie pretty

508.44 --> 517.32
much that didn't grow better as time

512.519 --> 519.88
went this one is it's great it's just

517.32 --> 522.08
great and really anybody out there

519.88 --> 525.399
that's going to say oh it's not great at

522.08 --> 530.12
all seriously go [ __ ]

525.399 --> 534.959
yourself it is great the the cast is

530.12 --> 538.44
good they're really into it there is

534.959 --> 540.4399999999999
like believable personal

538.44 --> 543.6400000000001
development

540.44 --> 544.6
and there's like there's just so much

543.64 --> 547.68
like

544.6 --> 550.6800000000001
heartfelt development in it from many

547.68 --> 553.68
different perspectives it it's just

550.68 --> 553.68
very

558.12 --> 564.36
good like every single episode that I

561.0 --> 567.519
watched was just great like every single

564.36 --> 570.6800000000001
one and even though there were like some

567.519 --> 573.16
cookie traits to it in a way

570.68 --> 575.88
like even that like was just felt like a

573.16 --> 578.4399999999999
natural part of it and hey that [ __ ] was

575.88 --> 580.72
in the original cartoon

578.44 --> 582.8000000000001
plenty one thing from the original

580.72 --> 586.36
cartoon even like watching a bit of it

582.8 --> 591.3599999999999
back was that the original cartoon kind

586.36 --> 595.839
of felt devoid in ways like it was

591.36 --> 598.32
almost lacking in feeling and even like

595.839 --> 601.32
in the overall looks of

598.32 --> 601.32
it

604.0 --> 609.399
you felt like it was a little bit Hollow

606.44 --> 611.0
in a ways really like just what you were

609.399 --> 616.2
looking

611.0 --> 619.56
at well this liveaction series just

616.2 --> 623.72
completely correct all those

619.56 --> 625.7199999999999
issues it's a fullon spectacle it's

623.72 --> 628.32
funny

625.72 --> 631.12
it's just

628.32 --> 633.9590000000001
great I really hope they Contin like

631.12 --> 637.12
every character was likable like every

633.959 --> 640.76
every single [ __ ] character in the

637.12 --> 642.8
entire series was likable okay that is

640.76 --> 646.92
almost

642.8 --> 649.399
shocking in a time like this like wait

646.92 --> 652.399
what it's

649.399 --> 655.04
2024 and there's a

652.399 --> 659.44
production where everything is likable

655.04 --> 662.5999999999999
that's like surreal it is every single

659.44 --> 664.8000000000001
character in the entire series was

662.6 --> 669.0400000000001
likable there's nothing about it where

664.8 --> 672.1999999999999
you're like nothing not one

669.04 --> 674.399
occasion it's incredible I've never seen

672.2 --> 677.9200000000001
anything like

674.399 --> 680.92
it has anyone seen Dune 2

677.92 --> 680.92
yet

683.519 --> 691.12
uh I think I downloaded a cam version of

687.16 --> 694.48
it but no Dune 2 is out very fresh

691.12 --> 697.399
and still waiting for like official

694.48 --> 701.399
blu-ray releases so I can like watch a

697.399 --> 705.36
proper version but I hear it's great as

701.399 --> 705.36
well I'm looking forward to

712.44 --> 719.6
it they condensed more episodes into the

715.399 --> 724.68
Eight Episodes opened for the public

719.6 --> 724.6800000000001
yeah it is a bit more condensed that is

726.72 --> 732.279
true but it is really like a a

729.399 --> 734.12
condensation that is the best of like

732.279 --> 738.8
all the best

734.12 --> 741.36
things and you yeah you could say like

738.8 --> 745.68
well it wouldn't it wouldn't hurt if

741.36 --> 745.6800000000001
they just put more stuff in between

745.72 --> 750.8000000000001
it but it's

748.16 --> 753.399
great

750.8 --> 755.56
what series oh orphan M tessi I'm

753.399 --> 758.6
talking

755.56 --> 763.5189999999999
about the a avatar The Last

758.6 --> 763.519
Airbender the live action Netflix

765.88 --> 771.279
series The Gentle what you know not the

768.88 --> 774.279
gentlemen what the hell are you talking

771.279 --> 774.279
about

778.12 --> 781.12
uh

784.199 --> 788.199
does anyone go to the theater I'd love

786.519 --> 791.76
to go to the theater but I don't want to

788.199 --> 794.24
go to the theater on my own that

791.76 --> 796.959
sucks I mean I could do it but it it

794.24 --> 801.32
would suck and besides it would cost

796.959 --> 801.3199999999999
money and that money I don't

805.279 --> 812.399
have and in a freaking theater you can't

809.399 --> 812.399
watch it in your own

823.399 --> 830.44
pace can schedule watch over next

826.32 --> 833.279
weekend take a day off from

830.44 --> 836.5600000000001
work

833.279 --> 840.48
fine that's up to

836.56 --> 842.68
you but if you really want to enjoyed I

840.48 --> 846.1990000000001
I recommend you don't just watch it in

842.68 --> 847.04
one single binge watch you could do that

846.199 --> 850.8389999999999
but

847.04 --> 850.8389999999999
then it's like you

850.88 --> 856.16
just I've enjoyed it watching it over

853.56 --> 857.959
the course of like two weeks with some

856.16 --> 861.519
time in between

857.959 --> 865.5999999999999
episodes like what watch one or

861.519 --> 868.36
two just to let it all sink in because

865.6 --> 871.279
there is just a lot of Glory in it like

868.36 --> 875.36
a lot a lot of like amazing

871.279 --> 877.8389999999999
architectural designs amazing absolutely

875.36 --> 880.839
astounding everything in it is just

877.839 --> 880.839
gorgeous

881.24 --> 889.6800000000001
everything I have been extremely

885.48 --> 889.6800000000001
impressed and I'm probably not the only

892.759 --> 898.04
one the World

895.399 --> 900.92
Behind Oro

898.04 --> 904.3199999999999
wumble hello clutch good to see

900.92 --> 904.3199999999999
[Music]

911.56 --> 914.92
you right

915.88 --> 920.639
but it's a great series I hope they

918.839 --> 924.6800000000001
completely finish

920.639 --> 924.6800000000001
it without too many

927.959 --> 935.04
issues

929.8 --> 939.88
because I mean it's a pretty long series

935.04 --> 941.8
and the kid the main actor is a kid they

939.88 --> 943.68
can't take too long or the kid's going

941.8 --> 946.92
to grow

943.68 --> 949.959
up there's that practical

946.92 --> 952.56
problem but thus far it's been

949.959 --> 952.56
absolutely

952.759 --> 957.92
Splendid and yeah he if you're going to

955.12 --> 960.44
get nitpicky you could theorize how it

957.92 --> 964.079
could even be slightly better but

960.44 --> 968.8800000000001
seriously screw that like it

964.079 --> 971.8389999999999
is it is just fantastic it's great it's

968.88 --> 974.8389999999999
better than the original that is just

971.839 --> 974.839
mind-blowing to

978.839 --> 985.8800000000001
me better as in the production overall

982.6 --> 988.1990000000001
is better the the original just had the

985.88 --> 990.4399999999999
idea and the the original story is

988.199 --> 991.959
really fantastic ftic always knew that

990.44 --> 995.1990000000001
it's like

991.959 --> 998.7589999999999
one Avatar last air bender has is like

995.199 --> 1001.399
storywise one of the best most

998.759 --> 1004.519
interesting

1001.399 --> 1008.04
stories that I've ever come

1004.519 --> 1010.04
across for a series and that was always

1008.04 --> 1012.759
great about it the world concept is

1010.04 --> 1015.88
great how it develops the character

1012.759 --> 1015.88
development in that is

1017.839 --> 1021.639
great

1019.639 --> 1023.439
and it doesn't lose that it it still

1021.639 --> 1026.919
follows the same

1023.439 --> 1030.039
things same formula except it just has

1026.919 --> 1034.3190000000002
astounding graphics and action scenes

1030.039 --> 1037.0
are great but not too much like in the

1034.319 --> 1039.199
cartoon they had issues where there's

1037.0 --> 1042.4
action and then there's just too much

1039.199 --> 1044.959
action like literally like you get bored

1042.4 --> 1049.039
you get bored with the action in the

1044.959 --> 1052.3200000000002
cartoon series you really do it just

1049.039 --> 1055.36
happens it's like yeah yeah fighting oh

1052.32 --> 1057.12
that and you're just like oh okay in

1055.36 --> 1058.9189999999999
this you don't have that issue at all

1057.12 --> 1061.1599999999999
it's like every part is just like

1058.919 --> 1063.88
compelling it it's fantastic the

1061.16 --> 1067.64
direction is like one of the best I've

1063.88 --> 1067.64
ever seen like

1068.36 --> 1077.799
ever of all movies and all series ever

1073.039 --> 1082.799
it I give it thus far really a 10 it is

1077.799 --> 1082.799
a 10 I've never seen anything this

1084.24 --> 1091.799
good yeah the movie sucked it was

1089.12 --> 1095.3999999999999
ridiculous it was

1091.799 --> 1098.36
pretentious the characters were just

1095.4 --> 1101.0800000000002
incorrect didn't match the original

1098.36 --> 1105.6399999999999
series or the story it was a a total

1101.08 --> 1106.76
cluster screw [ __ ] up of pretentiousness

1105.64 --> 1110.2800000000002
and

1106.76 --> 1114.76
sloppiness the movie sucked

1110.28 --> 1114.76
like that you can't compare it in any

1115.84 --> 1122.24
way it was like a ridiculously rushed

1119.2 --> 1125.32
stupid thing the series is great it's a

1122.24 --> 1127.24
little rushed but it's almost like

1125.32 --> 1129.4399999999998
rushed in a good

1127.24 --> 1131.64
way because if it would have been

1129.44 --> 1133.3200000000002
exactly at the pace of the original

1131.64 --> 1136.3600000000001
series well then it would have had the

1133.32 --> 1139.8799999999999
issues of the original series mainly

1136.36 --> 1144.1589999999999
boring good story but [ __ ] boring at

1139.88 --> 1148.159
times and like not very compelling to

1144.159 --> 1150.3600000000001
look at at times just it wasn't it was a

1148.159 --> 1155.3600000000001
great series but it had its

1150.36 --> 1159.3999999999999
issues they condensed it and made it

1155.36 --> 1159.3999999999999
optimal the best you could

1160.4 --> 1165.039
get

1162.039 --> 1165.039
anyway

1167.72 --> 1172.88
uh

1169.679 --> 1172.88
Kingdom of Heaven oh

1173.12 --> 1176.4399999999998
god king

1176.84 --> 1181.12
Baldwin I know that movie from

1189.72 --> 1196.28
reviews wow you like two and a half man

1194.6 --> 1201.039
wow

1196.28 --> 1201.039
well that just goes to show what you're

1202.14 --> 1205.3590000000002
[Music]

1216.88 --> 1223.2800000000002
into what do you mean by that I mean by

1220.48 --> 1223.28
that that it

1226.64 --> 1231.679
sucks the only half way entertaining

1229.52 --> 1235.12
about that series was that Charlie Sheen

1231.679 --> 1240.0
was in it so who the hell

1235.12 --> 1242.1589999999999
cares anyway sorry it's just that I got

1240.0 --> 1244.24
avatar Last Airbender on the mind and

1242.159 --> 1248.2800000000002
then bringing up something like that is

1244.24 --> 1250.72
just like yeah I'm sorry I'm I'm still

1248.28 --> 1252.6789999999999
having a 10 in my head I don't really

1250.72 --> 1255.48
care about

1252.679 --> 1259.24
fives at

1255.48 --> 1261.559
all which is what that was like

1259.24 --> 1261.559
very

1262.16 --> 1265.269
[Music]

1266.76 --> 1272.279
forgettable

1269.32 --> 1275.799
right but that's fun I watched it too at

1272.279 --> 1278.559
the time it's

1275.799 --> 1281.36
just something you watch because you're

1278.559 --> 1284.36
bored not because it's so

1281.36 --> 1284.36
fantastic

1286.6 --> 1293.559
anyway uh

1290.24 --> 1297.159
yeah so yeah my judgment is in on the

1293.559 --> 1301.24
series it is the best series I've ever

1297.159 --> 1302.48
seen and I have don't have to give you

1301.24 --> 1306.4
any

1302.48 --> 1310.24
doubt at all about that it is absolutely

1306.4 --> 1313.24
the best series I have ever

1310.24 --> 1315.88
seen and in ways I doubt that it'll ever

1313.24 --> 1320.52
be surpassed

1315.88 --> 1320.5200000000002
too if it will I'll be quite as

1321.64 --> 1328.5200000000002
SED although yeah the new Dune movies

1326.24 --> 1330.36
also in the same Trend have really

1328.52 --> 1332.32
stepped

1330.36 --> 1336.8799999999999
up they

1332.32 --> 1341.84
are great as well they're they're pretty

1336.88 --> 1345.88
good not perfect but pretty good and

1341.84 --> 1348.6399999999999
style-wise very very interesting

1345.88 --> 1351.0800000000002
and and I can't wait to see the second d

1348.64 --> 1353.96
movie as

1351.08 --> 1356.6789999999999
well although I really love these this

1353.96 --> 1357.559
the crazy old David Lynch version I love

1356.679 --> 1361.5590000000002
that

1357.559 --> 1363.559
one even with the S silly CGI I mean

1361.559 --> 1366.6789999999999
it's it's just

1363.559 --> 1368.52
great but the new one is like super

1366.679 --> 1373.52
Advanced high

1368.52 --> 1376.9189999999999
teish and really brings out the Dune

1373.52 --> 1376.9189999999999
Universe how it

1377.44 --> 1381.72
works L debatable

1385.2 --> 1391.48
D any R pill

1388.96 --> 1394.6000000000001
recomended

1391.48 --> 1397.159
uh okay a man go well while back own

1394.6 --> 1400.559
Benjamin brought

1397.159 --> 1400.5590000000002
to was it

1403.279 --> 1410.44
again movie to the table what's

1407.44 --> 1410.44
the

1411.08 --> 1414.32
see still

1414.72 --> 1419.279
there damn it I hope it didn't throw it

1417.039 --> 1419.279
in

1431.48 --> 1435.24
the what's that call

1437.44 --> 1440.44
again

1451.159 --> 1458.48
crap I forgot what was

1454.799 --> 1460.679
called yeah there's not much uh not a

1458.48 --> 1463.559
real point to trying to share a movie

1460.679 --> 1466.5590000000002
when I don't remember the

1463.559 --> 1466.559
name

1467.36 --> 1470.36
H

1474.24 --> 1476.799
right but I

1478.48 --> 1486.1200000000001
mean

1480.64 --> 1486.1200000000001
okay are you deleting messages or made

1496.96 --> 1501.919
Tessy debate Moxy oh I'm sure he

1502.88 --> 1506.88
is thanks for catching that

1507.08 --> 1513.12
clutch and Deb can he can be Moxy all he

1510.6 --> 1516.1999999999998
likes but he's not going to be allowed

1513.12 --> 1518.399
as Moxy in here because Moxy is just not

1516.2 --> 1520.44
allowed yeah I know you're like a

1518.399 --> 1523.9189999999999
[ __ ] parasite that just can't stay

1520.44 --> 1525.64
out of anything but you're officially

1523.919 --> 1527.44
not allowed and that's never going to

1525.64 --> 1531.64
change so yeah you're just going to have

1527.44 --> 1533.6000000000001
to use undercover to do that and when

1531.64 --> 1536.96
they stop liking you I'll kick you the

1533.6 --> 1536.9599999999998
[ __ ] out as I always

1539.679 --> 1542.679
do

1549.08 --> 1557.24
H yeah so I don't really have a uh a red

1552.76 --> 1560.24
pill movie on the mind right

1557.24 --> 1560.24
now

1566.12 --> 1572.2399999999998
I have started like after uh Avatar

1570.32 --> 1576.799
there's another Ser I bumped into with

1572.24 --> 1576.799
like one of my favorite character

1578.08 --> 1582.1589999999999
actors what the hell is it called

1582.52 --> 1588.799
again like it seems like quite the silly

1585.44 --> 1592.48
series oh yeah resident alien

1588.799 --> 1595.32
and it is dubious but I mean it's that

1592.48 --> 1599.96
guy I don't really I can't remember his

1595.32 --> 1602.36
name he's he's like the pilot from what

1599.96 --> 1605.159
the [ __ ] another

1602.36 --> 1608.1589999999999
whoa from

1605.159 --> 1610.3200000000002
uh from Firefly

1608.159 --> 1612.7600000000002
series and that is like one of the

1610.32 --> 1615.84
funniest guys I've ever seen on screen

1612.76 --> 1619.6
and like he plays the the alien

1615.84 --> 1622.72
character in this series and he's like

1619.6 --> 1626.559
basically doing a really weird autistic

1622.72 --> 1629.0
act and it's it's really

1626.559 --> 1631.44
funny I thought first like oh this is

1629.0 --> 1634.0
going to be a little bit off ping or

1631.44 --> 1637.64
anything like oh

1634.0 --> 1640.71
aliens but I mean he is really freaking

1637.64 --> 1641.76
funny I'm liking

1640.71 --> 1645.24
[Music]

1641.76 --> 1648.64
it so that's the new series I'm starting

1645.24 --> 1651.6
and talking about Firefly now I'm seeing

1648.64 --> 1654.64
Mal that character is apparently in

1651.6 --> 1656.8799999999999
another Ser called the rookie a police

1654.64 --> 1660.279
series like what the hell why why why

1656.88 --> 1660.279
are they popping up all of a

1661.6 --> 1668.6399999999999
sudden I mean that looks interesting too

1664.559 --> 1668.6399999999999
cuz I like those characters were

1669.519 --> 1675.24
awesome but it's good to see that uh the

1675.799 --> 1685.44
character see if I can there's the name

1679.6 --> 1685.4399999999998
Alan tudk I think that's his name

1690.44 --> 1695.96
yeah like that guy is a great actor I

1693.88 --> 1698.5590000000002
love him he's so funny he's like

1695.96 --> 1698.559
naturally

1706.32 --> 1711.0
funny oh the rookes already that's a

1709.24 --> 1713.44
series that's already ongoing for a

1711.0 --> 1713.44
while

1737.039 --> 1740.039
huh

1745.76 --> 1751.08
what uh are you freaking talking about

1749.72 --> 1754.24
sports

1751.08 --> 1755.96
again there's no Sports Talk in my chat

1754.24 --> 1759.76
that pisses me

1755.96 --> 1759.76
off it's spam to

1759.84 --> 1767.32
me like nobody [ __ ] cares about your

1763.24 --> 1771.039
[ __ ] [ __ ] Sports okay it's [ __ ]

1767.32 --> 1774.039
and a lot of it is like fake and set up

1771.039 --> 1774.039
anyway

1782.799 --> 1785.799
corrupt

1789.399 --> 1792.399
good

1797.039 --> 1800.039
right

1807.08 --> 1813.6789999999999
yeah a little bit of Alex Jones watching

1811.0 --> 1816.72
yesterday and there was this weird I I

1813.679 --> 1816.72
didn't get it like

1817.279 --> 1823.799
it he was on with Eddie Bravo and they

1820.84 --> 1826.399
were talking about relatively recent

1823.799 --> 1829.399
things but I think it might have been an

1826.399 --> 1832.8799999999999
old replay I'm not

1829.399 --> 1834.5189999999998
sure what it was kind of funny to like

1832.88 --> 1837.2
see Eddie

1834.519 --> 1839.88
Bravo he was Eddie Bravo is like so

1837.2 --> 1842.8400000000001
freaking foul mouth makes me look like a

1839.88 --> 1845.159
choir boy in comparison it just says the

1842.84 --> 1848.36
f word and everything full out every

1845.159 --> 1851.2
single time like he just doesn't give a

1848.36 --> 1851.1999999999998
[ __ ] at

1852.72 --> 1859.919
all talking about Elon Musk Elon Musk oh

1857.6 --> 1862.24
Elon musk oh I put Elon Musk in the

1859.919 --> 1864.0
title so now the entire world's like oh

1862.24 --> 1866.279
my God is there something special about

1864.0 --> 1869.44
Elon Musk the Oracle had him in his

1866.279 --> 1872.48
title he dreamt about him maybe he's the

1869.44 --> 1875.48
Savior after all or something I I don't

1872.48 --> 1875.48
know why the hell that

1884.399 --> 1890.6789999999999
happens but yeah I did actually dream

1886.88 --> 1890.679
about Elon Musk and that was really

1894.32 --> 1899.8799999999999
weird oh Alex Jones choked yeah that was

1897.039 --> 1903.399
another time that was so

1899.88 --> 1907.7990000000002
silly and he snorted

1903.399 --> 1912.36
like yeah I remember that that was just

1907.799 --> 1912.36
weird no but it wasn't an in studio

1916.84 --> 1924.519
interview

1919.159 --> 1924.519
you hate soccer never got why it's so

1925.0 --> 1933.159
big I mean I kind of like the

1927.96 --> 1933.159
international games a little bit

1933.72 --> 1942.799
sometimes a little bit

1937.279 --> 1944.2
it's but like clubs like I just can't

1942.799 --> 1947.32
give a

1944.2 --> 1952.2
[ __ ] like it's all become so freaking

1947.32 --> 1954.519
convol it and like oh oh this club oh

1952.2 --> 1959.159
like like how many actual Dutch people

1954.519 --> 1961.039
are in this Dutch Club oh like 10% oh

1959.159 --> 1963.96
wow how

1961.039 --> 1968.039
interesting no not interesting it's just

1963.96 --> 1970.08
a bunch of stupid corporate crap like

1968.039 --> 1972.799
soccer is all just a bunch of corporate

1970.08 --> 1975.6
crap now overpaid corporate

1972.799 --> 1978.12
crap half of them drop dead on the field

1975.6 --> 1980.9599999999998
these days it's [ __ ] it's like such

1978.12 --> 1984.36
a [ __ ] waste of

1980.96 --> 1984.3600000000001
time it

1989.519 --> 1993.48
sucks they call it

1991.76 --> 1998.519
football

1993.48 --> 1998.519
yeah in Dutch it's football

1998.88 --> 2006.1200000000001
so Americans have another

2002.639 --> 2008.6
football which is ridiculous because you

2006.12 --> 2011.76
actually carry the freaking ball around

2008.6 --> 2014.9599999999998
and you call it football no Americans

2011.76 --> 2018.8799999999999
are just [ __ ] about their

2014.96 --> 2022.76
sport I mean literally

2018.88 --> 2025.72
yeah who the hell calls a sport

2022.76 --> 2028.24
football when they don't even use a ball

2025.72 --> 2030.679
it's not even round and you give it one

2028.24 --> 2035.2
[ __ ] kick in the entire game like

2030.679 --> 2035.2
it's [ __ ] it's not

2036.72 --> 2039.72
football

2041.12 --> 2046.7199999999998
hand egg that's

2043.679 --> 2049.879
right it's [ __ ] I'm

2046.72 --> 2054.919
sorry like that they named that football

2049.879 --> 2058.7999999999997
it isn't football it's nothing like

2054.919 --> 2061.2
football in the entire game a foot hits

2058.8 --> 2064.9190000000003
the ball one [ __ ]

2061.2 --> 2064.919
time it's not

2066.72 --> 2071.2799999999997
football

2068.8 --> 2073.679
it's like calling soccer

2071.28 --> 2076.8
headball that would be more accurate

2073.679 --> 2082.44
than calling what you play

2076.8 --> 2082.44
football cuz yeah it's just I'm

2083.2 --> 2089.0789999999997
sorry but over here we call that

2086.919 --> 2092.72
basically rug

2089.079 --> 2095.32
rugby cuz the British still do that it's

2092.72 --> 2098.3999999999996
like American football except without

2095.32 --> 2102.88
the protection it's much rougher

2098.4 --> 2105.119
rugby that's a way better name for it

2102.88 --> 2106.7200000000003
cuz it's about ruggedness and bashing

2105.119 --> 2110.2400000000002
into one another and all that [ __ ]

2106.72 --> 2110.24
you're not supposed to do that with

2113.88 --> 2121.6800000000003
soccer anyway enough about that

2118.32 --> 2124.079
crap you can't pass forward in rugby oh

2121.68 --> 2126.64
okay have some slight different rules

2124.079 --> 2129.1600000000003
and all that I don't care

2126.64 --> 2132.839
really

2129.16 --> 2135.839
American throwball yeah

2132.839 --> 2135.839
that

2146.0 --> 2149.96
yeah you never like

2150.72 --> 2156.2
basketball I don't know I like playing

2153.28 --> 2158.7200000000003
Bas basketball is a is a fun game to

2156.2 --> 2161.359
play I don't know why you'd want to

2158.72 --> 2164.2
watch it all the time though but to play

2161.359 --> 2164.2
was pretty

2165.319 --> 2172.72
fun I got decently well at it even

2168.839 --> 2172.72
though I'm not very tall

2175.4 --> 2181.52
guy because it's all about that balance

2179.2 --> 2183.7999999999997
like you can have like real good

2181.52 --> 2187.72
coordination and just make like great

2183.8 --> 2190.8
moves if you're very balanced and quick

2187.72 --> 2192.3999999999996
and you got that feel perfectly it's I

2190.8 --> 2194.8390000000004
like it basketball is an interesting

2192.4 --> 2197.48
game to play I wouldn't really want to

2194.839 --> 2199.68
watch it all the time

2197.48 --> 2203.72
though snooker

2199.68 --> 2203.72
player yeah when yeah a

2204.56 --> 2210.16
little I've played some Billiards never

2208.119 --> 2215.119
really had like a snooker

2210.16 --> 2219.52
game maybe maybe a couple of

2215.119 --> 2219.52
times but yeah

2221.359 --> 2226.61
I'd play

2221.98 --> 2226.61
[Music]

2227.88 --> 2234.7200000000003
pool but like how good I am at it it it

2231.8 --> 2237.0
goes it it varies wildly there's like

2234.72 --> 2238.7999999999997
sometimes where I'm like bro I'm in the

2237.0 --> 2241.92
zone and it's like I can just make

2238.8 --> 2243.88
magical shots that like I don't even

2241.92 --> 2245.6800000000003
understand how that's possible and it

2243.88 --> 2247.28
keeps happening and then other days it's

2245.68 --> 2249.7599999999998
just like no matter what I do it just

2247.28 --> 2252.92
fits K every single shot it's I'm kind

2249.76 --> 2252.92
of unpredictable with

2258.24 --> 2265.2799999999997
it it's been ages since I last played

2262.319 --> 2268.2799999999997
that anyway why the hell are we talking

2265.28 --> 2268.28
about sports damn

2276.44 --> 2279.44
it

2290.2 --> 2294.72
that's will needs ail Fally ver

2292.92 --> 2297.7200000000003
demanding

2294.72 --> 2297.72
yeah

2297.839 --> 2304.24
well if you're going to go like top

2300.4 --> 2306.92
sport a man go then yeah I mean if you

2304.24 --> 2309.1189999999997
have a better build then like you can't

2306.92 --> 2311.7200000000003
play against that they'll just outmatch

2309.119 --> 2314.28
every single move you make but just like

2311.72 --> 2317.3999999999996
if you have guys that are like on your

2314.28 --> 2321.0
level it's a great game to play but yeah

2317.4 --> 2324.119
if you then have some like Juggernaut or

2321.0 --> 2326.079
tall tall ass black dude that really

2324.119 --> 2327.48
knows this game like yeah that's not fun

2326.079 --> 2330.6400000000003
because they're just going to outmatch

2327.48 --> 2333.64
every single move and that just

2330.64 --> 2333.64
sucks

2336.04 --> 2340.64
so r

2338.079 --> 2340.6400000000003
oh my

2343.04 --> 2350.599
God you realize that wrestling is like a

2346.72 --> 2353.0
theater sport right it's fake you have

2350.599 --> 2353.0
to

2353.76 --> 2359.4
like argue and discuss like what you're

2356.8 --> 2359.4
going to be

2359.68 --> 2366.24
doing before you actually start the

2363.52 --> 2368.88
match like it is a theater sport it's

2366.24 --> 2372.0
not real it never

2368.88 --> 2375.0
was and it's can be entertaining

2372.0 --> 2380.52
somewhat but I mean it's not

2375.0 --> 2383.4
real it's all fake bashing fake th like

2380.52 --> 2386.4
it's all fake like supposed to be like

2383.4 --> 2389.56
impressive looking but not damaging

2386.4 --> 2389.56
that's the whole point of

2396.319 --> 2402.72
it competitive hot that no that's just

2400.0 --> 2402.72
disgusting

2414.359 --> 2419.24
theity in Alex Jones voice it's all

2421.92 --> 2427.839
fake right but I mean that's they admit

2426.319 --> 2429.64
it

2427.839 --> 2433.68
if you go up to them and you start

2429.64 --> 2436.5989999999997
asking like oh how don't they get hurt

2433.68 --> 2440.2
then they'll just tell you it's it's

2436.599 --> 2441.599
theater they will tell you to your face

2440.2 --> 2445.64
it's

2441.599 --> 2449.56
theater just enjoy it it's a theater

2445.64 --> 2449.56
it's not actually

2450.0 --> 2454.68
sport I mean if it was literally a fight

2453.92 --> 2457.839
like

2454.68 --> 2462.1189999999997
that bro like those people people would

2457.839 --> 2465.2799999999997
be like breaking their necks and

2462.119 --> 2467.2400000000002
[ __ ] like that stuff would be over very

2465.28 --> 2470.5600000000004
quickly and there would be a lot of like

2467.24 --> 2472.64
really serious injuries like continually

2470.56 --> 2476.64
like it's not a viable sport if it was

2472.64 --> 2476.64
real it's really for the

2476.68 --> 2479.68
entertainment

2484.56 --> 2490.88
anyway like imagine that they're like

2487.319 --> 2492.64
thrown down like that uncontrolled dude

2490.88 --> 2495.599
like have your neck in the wrong way and

2492.64 --> 2498.2799999999997
you literally have a totally broken snap

2495.599 --> 2500.88
neck like

2498.28 --> 2503.4
no they have to train it they have to

2500.88 --> 2506.96
train falling down they have to train

2503.4 --> 2510.359
all those things to make sure that it

2506.96 --> 2513.76
can be done without them getting hurt

2510.359 --> 2513.7599999999998
that's like what they train

2514.04 --> 2522.0
for they train to be smashed down

2518.88 --> 2525.8
and bashed without getting hurt that's

2522.0 --> 2525.8
their training that's what they train

2535.2 --> 2538.2
for

2546.119 --> 2550.8
anyway

2548.359 --> 2554.319
nobody

2550.8 --> 2558.04
cares [ __ ] H Maniacs like I don't want

2554.319 --> 2560.48
to go talk detail [ __ ] I'm just a

2558.04 --> 2562.52
generalized description is one thing

2560.48 --> 2565.68
yeah I don't care about your [ __ ]

2562.52 --> 2569.559
little players I don't care about the

[Music]

2595.48 --> 2599.839

2616.319 --> 2623.68

2619.92 --> 2623.6800000000003
know why are you asking

2626.44 --> 2632.2400000000002
that last team three days ago he never

2629.319 --> 2632.24
gave me that second

2632.48 --> 2639.04
call and duper well duper was here

2635.72 --> 2639.04
yesterday so

2644.28 --> 2647.489
[Music]

2649.359 --> 2654.2
all right anyway I'm going to where's

2651.599 --> 2657.96
fiods I don't know if I haven't seen

2654.2 --> 2660.96
fire Roes in ages Richard G is still

2657.96 --> 2663.8
around I saw him like in a chat

2660.96 --> 2667.44
yesterday

2663.8 --> 2669.6400000000003
so it's not seen I yeah Dan has not been

2667.44 --> 2672.64
around for some reason but he still

2669.64 --> 2672.64
hangs around in the

2674.24 --> 2679.7999999999997
Discord I don't know

2676.92 --> 2682.92
why maybe it has to do just with me kind

2679.8 --> 2682.92
of splitting off with

2684.68 --> 2689.8799999999997
fed right I mean you had to consider

2687.72 --> 2693.68
that some of these people were like

2689.88 --> 2695.88
liking me because I was part of fed and

2693.68 --> 2700.9199999999996
so when I'm

2695.88 --> 2703.28
not the they're just not really inclined

2700.92 --> 2703.28
to hang

2709.119 --> 2714.28
around it goes up and down I mean dank

2712.559 --> 2716.6400000000003
makes periodic

2714.28 --> 2720.52
visits to my

2716.64 --> 2722.68
chat like over the years he wouldn't

2720.52 --> 2725.28
always be there in chat every day

2722.68 --> 2725.2799999999997
absolutely

2725.96 --> 2728.96
not

2741.32 --> 2744.4190000000003
[Applause]

2744.62 --> 2763.5989999999997
[Music]

2766.28 --> 2771.65
[Music]

2775.15 --> 2780.82
[Music]

2785.92 --> 2788.92
in

2794.74 --> 2799.7299999999996
[Music]

2800.52 --> 2802.68
all

2803.16 --> 2810.0
right

2806.0 --> 2810.0
what the hell are you talking

2811.04 --> 2819.44
about is Selling paintings now why

2814.72 --> 2822.04
why he was doing that all the time he's

2819.44 --> 2824.48
a artist he

2822.04 --> 2827.4
paints and I like his paintings I hope

2824.48 --> 2830.52
he comes back but on the other hand I've

2827.4 --> 2832.52
said some things apparently the way that

2830.52 --> 2835.319
I've talked about people and I

2832.52 --> 2837.28
threatened when I got all rage win and

2835.319 --> 2839.4
threaten people's kids there's a whole

2837.28 --> 2840.8
bunch of people that were like I hate

2839.4 --> 2842.96
Arwin now

2840.8 --> 2845.8390000000004
forever

2842.96 --> 2848.839
so maybe that's because of

2845.839 --> 2848.839
that

2853.48 --> 2858.559
there's a whole bunch of people that

2854.8 --> 2861.8390000000004
have like not come back because of my

2858.559 --> 2861.8390000000004
extreme moods and all

2862.28 --> 2866.599
that and I'm not going to hold it

2865.16 --> 2869.52
against

2866.599 --> 2871.839
them sometimes people just move on

2869.52 --> 2873.88
because they just need to move on and

2871.839 --> 2878.0789999999997
they get saturated

2873.88 --> 2881.319

2878.079 --> 2884.6400000000003
it can be very interesting

2881.319 --> 2886.96
continually sometimes it's just not the

2884.64 --> 2886.96

2890.4 --> 2897.88
frequency so yeah people go dude I've

2894.24 --> 2899.52

just

3182.0 --> 3188.839
leave yeah he's not contributing

3184.68 --> 3191.9199999999996
anything good in any way he's just a

3188.839 --> 3194.92
troll hurting

[ __ ]

3200.48 --> 3207.76

and if some whiny [ __ ] troll from his

3211.079 --> 3216.079
starts showing up getting all defensive

3213.92 --> 3218.7200000000003
just kick them the [ __ ] out and let it

3216.079 --> 3218.7200000000003
be

3218.799 --> 3224.48
over defenders to troll so they don't go

3221.28 --> 3227.52
after yeah and that's his fatal mistake

3224.48 --> 3228.92
cuz that means they will go after him

3227.52 --> 3233.7599999999998
like they have with

3228.92 --> 3236.119
everybody and hey yeah I don't paner the

3236.119 --> 3240.799
with it

3237.88 --> 3245.1600000000003
oh and I'm doing just

3240.799 --> 3248.319
fine cuz eventually they give

3245.16 --> 3250.359
up then they try again and then it's

3248.319 --> 3252.2799999999997
just like yeah eventually it's like you

3250.359 --> 3254.64
just build a wall and they just don't

3252.28 --> 3254.6400000000003
come

3254.68 --> 3259.2
through they can't get through they

3256.92 --> 3260.92
can't get through with the spirit and

3259.2 --> 3263.4399999999996
then they just

3260.92 --> 3266.44
like yeah because they're just [ __ ]

3263.44 --> 3269.359
trolls like a goblin army they're very

3266.44 --> 3271.88
very weak and the only thing that keeps

3269.359 --> 3274.0
them going is the idea that they're

3271.88 --> 3277.1600000000003

internet it is it is the dumbest [ __ ]

3303.0 --> 3309.28
thing you could ever

3304.559 --> 3311.28
do it's like oh man I'll just let the

3309.28 --> 3314.119
parasites in my

3311.28 --> 3317.079
body because otherwise they'll be

3314.119 --> 3319.88

3343.88 --> 3348.6400000000003
well then deal with

3345.64 --> 3353.72
it and then if you deal with it it

3348.64 --> 3356.52
becomes less bad if you just let it in

3353.72 --> 3359.24
well guess what it's just going to be

3356.52 --> 3361.079
more it's going to be more now they

3359.24 --> 3364.4799999999996

yeah but the real God like he's just a

3456.52 --> 3461.799
bastard like what the [ __ ] is wrong with

3480.48 --> 3484.599
he trusted the demons and he gave it

3486.039 --> 3491.079
everything even we told him like hey

3488.28 --> 3492.92
yeah we've been through that experience

3491.079 --> 3497.3590000000004
it's not what you think it

3492.92 --> 3502.079
is also his definition of death was just

3497.359 --> 3505.119
[ __ ] but I've died man uh well if

3502.079 --> 3506.8390000000004
you're here to talk about it you didn't

3505.119 --> 3510.0
die

3506.839 --> 3512.88
it's called a near death experience when

3510.0 --> 3516.839
you die you don't come back that's the

3512.88 --> 3519.2400000000002
point and he just refused to accept that

3516.839 --> 3521.839
it's like no I

3519.24 --> 3525.359
died you just don't know what it is like

3521.839 --> 3527.0389999999998
to die like yeah nobody does and lives

3525.359 --> 3531.319
to tell about it that's the point of

3527.039 --> 3531.3190000000004
death he just refus to hear it what a

3533.039 --> 3540.599
weirdo yeah shit's too much but I mean

3535.799 --> 3542.559
he was like clearly a drug addict I was

3540.599 --> 3545.4
like dude you need some help with that

3542.559 --> 3547.92
drug problem and it was not joking or

3545.4 --> 3551.52
mocking him it's like no that guy has

3547.92 --> 3555.44
like a very serious drug

3551.52 --> 3559.2
problem he was [ __ ] obsessed with it

3555.44 --> 3559.2000000000003
that guy's a problem Big

3559.88 --> 3562.88
Time

3564.16 --> 3570.1189999999997
weird he's a cool guy I don't know man I

3567.52 --> 3572.48
don't think that's very cool and he

3570.119 --> 3575.0
wasn't very cool either against God and

3572.48 --> 3575.0
everything

3578.88 --> 3586.28
so it was Elon Musk

3582.559 --> 3588.44
money great launch yday oh

3586.28 --> 3593.4
yes yeah that's

3588.44 --> 3598.039
cute I mean it's just rocket launches

3593.4 --> 3598.039
it's just a bunch of modern fireworks

3621.52 --> 3627.96
doesn't SpaceX get a cut from the

3623.64 --> 3627.96
government yeah of course they do

3629.0 --> 3634.0
SpaceX and like all these other projects

3632.4 --> 3636.44
out there there's not there's not just

3634.0 --> 3638.079
SpaceX SpaceX is like one of the more

3636.44 --> 3639.92
prominent the more the ones that are

3638.079 --> 3643.0
actually making a little bit more

3639.92 --> 3647.2400000000002
effort they're all

3643.0 --> 3650.599
there to distract away from NASA which

3647.24 --> 3653.3999999999996
has been so universally discredited even

3650.599 --> 3654.92
by their own idiot idiotic actions like

3653.4 --> 3657.799
they mocked

3654.92 --> 3660.039
themselves

3657.799 --> 3663.359
it's the same thing it's just not the

3660.039 --> 3665.119
original NASA because then they'd have

3663.359 --> 3666.799
to account for the things that happened

3665.119 --> 3669.6400000000003
in the past that has been severely

3666.799 --> 3671.359
discredited so it's just the same thing

3669.64 --> 3673.7599999999998
but

3671.359 --> 3675.799
decentralized privatized it's all

3673.76 --> 3678.0
freaking sponsored by the government all

3675.799 --> 3678.0
of

3684.92 --> 3687.92
it

3696.92 --> 3700.319
is it on the cover

3700.559 --> 3703.559
up

3708.48 --> 3714.76
yeah how dare I how dare I say El mus

3713.0 --> 3717.839
what you thought he was a a [ __ ]

3714.76 --> 3717.8390000000004
savior or something

3718.0 --> 3725.44
can't be

3719.799 --> 3729.4
serious but yes anything space agency is

3725.44 --> 3729.4
in on the cover up

3731.359 --> 3738.5589999999997
obviously yeah they all do it the same

3735.76 --> 3741.2400000000002
way nobody sends a rocket just straight

3738.559 --> 3742.3190000000004
up they never do that they always set it

3741.24 --> 3745.0789999999997
in a

3742.319 --> 3746.599
curve it's all the same thing it's just

3745.079 --> 3748.119
the same program

3746.599 --> 3750.559
under a new

3748.119 --> 3753.0
cover right it's just like a mega

3750.559 --> 3755.079
Corporation gets super hostile Super

3753.0 --> 3758.0
Evil everybody figures out about their's

3755.079 --> 3761.3590000000004
lawsuits and [ __ ] guess what oh well

3758.0 --> 3764.839
we're just going to reinvest the profits

3761.359 --> 3767.4
into a new company that sort of does the

3764.839 --> 3770.359
same thing but it's a new Fresh name new

3767.4 --> 3771.96
opportunity oh we learned oh yeah we got

3770.359 --> 3773.5589999999997
a lot of employees from that previous

3771.96 --> 3776.079
totally corrupted company but there's

3773.559 --> 3780.2000000000003
new rules now and we're not going to do

3776.079 --> 3784.1600000000003
it again yeah yeah that's how that

3780.2 --> 3786.4399999999996
works that's how they do it and so they

3784.16 --> 3789.5589999999997
also do

3786.44 --> 3794.359
that the supposed rocket launches it's

3789.559 --> 3798.2000000000003
all the same [ __ ] yeah just take off the

3794.359 --> 3800.0389999999998
old coat throw it away and just start

3798.2 --> 3803.68
over again with a new coat do it the

3800.039 --> 3806.96
same things the same way but under a new

3803.68 --> 3810.2
name under a new brand Under a new

3806.96 --> 3812.319
logo yeah that's what they

3810.2 --> 3815.5989999999997
do this is

3812.319 --> 3818.16
not like a revelation or anything that

3815.599 --> 3822.2000000000003
they do that they've been doing that all

3818.16 --> 3822.2
out the 20th century already

3828.88 --> 3834.559
so yeah and the whole Space nonsense

3831.799 --> 3836.96
it's all about the futuristic image of

3834.559 --> 3839.88
America it's like America needs space

3836.96 --> 3843.76
launches or it wouldn't be seen by

3839.88 --> 3847.6800000000003
[ __ ] retards as the tip of the spear

3843.76 --> 3850.96
in oh we're so futuristic oh yeah

3847.68 --> 3850.96
besides their

3851.68 --> 3856.319
Weaponry the Rockets are there to kind

3854.24 --> 3858.4399999999996
of distract you away from the high-tech

3856.319 --> 3860.92
Weaponry that they do

3858.44 --> 3863.119
have because that just makes them looks

3860.92 --> 3866.4
like a total evil empire

3863.119 --> 3869.92
which can be argued for

3866.4 --> 3873.52
right rocket launchers are there to as a

3869.92 --> 3875.039
Feelgood consolidation pricee like oh

3873.52 --> 3877.599
we're so good we're oh we're really

3875.039 --> 3880.5200000000004
going to go there if like oh we're way

3877.599 --> 3882.039
better than all the other Empires cuz

3880.52 --> 3884.079
we're going to go to the moon and we're

3882.039 --> 3886.7200000000003
going to explore the stars and really

3884.079 --> 3889.1600000000003
one day it's going to happen really

3886.72 --> 3894.319
really we've only been saying it for 80

3889.16 --> 3894.319
years but it's going to happen really

3894.64 --> 3897.64
really

3904.48 --> 3907.639
[Music]

3912.359 --> 3917.319
yeah they're really going to do it we're

3914.72 --> 3920.72
really going to go to the

3917.319 --> 3923.92
Stars just believe it just look at the

3920.72 --> 3927.64
Rockets they're working on it right just

3923.92 --> 3929.559
rocket test every few years and like to

3927.64 --> 3933.359
keep your hopes up so you can keep

3929.559 --> 3936.7200000000003
believing that one day one day your

3933.359 --> 3939.119
children or your ancestors one day

3936.72 --> 3940.5589999999997
they'll go to the Mars and explore the

3939.119 --> 3944.279
stars

3940.559 --> 3947.52
and yeah yeah yeah just like your

3944.279 --> 3950.2
Grandpa probably thought

3947.52 --> 3952.44
that and your grandchildren will

3950.2 --> 3955.72
probably think the same thing about

3952.44 --> 3958.88
their grandchildren like one day one day

3955.72 --> 3961.5989999999997
will go to the Stars it's just endless

3958.88 --> 3965.4
nonsense getting

3961.599 --> 3965.4
postponed endless fake

3966.039 --> 3970.7200000000003
promises and yeah so that everybody

3968.72 --> 3973.279
believes that the United States is so

3970.72 --> 3976.24
freaking Advanced though they're so

3973.279 --> 3978.079
great they're so futuristic yeah they

3976.24 --> 3981.7599999999998
are

3978.079 --> 3983.88
futuristic they're very futuristic in

3981.76 --> 3986.4
realizing that you just have to promise

3983.88 --> 3988.96
The Impossible and keep keep doing it

3986.4 --> 3991.559
forever and then everybody will be dumb

3988.96 --> 3994.319
enough to keep believing over the

3991.559 --> 3996.8390000000004
generations that you are the tip of the

3994.319 --> 4001.68
spirit that you are futuristic even

3996.839 --> 4004.599
though it's been false promises for a

4001.68 --> 4008.1189999999997
century just keep doing it people are

4004.599 --> 4010.2000000000003
that [ __ ] yeah grandparents don't

4008.119 --> 4014.2000000000003
catch on and then tell their

4010.2 --> 4016.96
children they pass on the lie because it

4014.2 --> 4019.16
becomes a religion a religion of

4016.96 --> 4021.48
futurism something that can never be

4019.16 --> 4023.96
achieved but you can always dream about

4021.48 --> 4027.119
it that's what they do anyway I'm going

distance uh I can't say I didn't warn

4633.52 --> 4636.8
wrong I'll

4638.239 --> 4642.718999999999
no I'm not even going to explain what

4640.8 --> 4647.52
that means if I have to explain what

4642.719 --> 4647.52
that means then there's no point in even

4653.12 --> 4660.0
trying yeah but it's not going to be the

4657.8 --> 4663.4400000000005
way it was I'm not going to be part of

anymore and even if I wanted to I

4670.96 --> 4678.639
can't it's too much of a burden on me to

4675.6 --> 4682.280000000001

4678.639 --> 4685.28
hallucinate I'm not doing it anymore I'm

4682.28 --> 4688.12
not risking my

4685.28 --> 4690.199
health to be part of something that

4688.12 --> 4691.88
quite frankly I don't want to be a part

4690.199 --> 4697.36

4691.88 --> 4700.0

4769.199 --> 4775.44
do

4771.48 --> 4778.799999999999
that but my show is my

4775.44 --> 4780.759999999999
own and my show is not bad for my health

4778.8 --> 4785.159000000001
it's good for my

4780.76 --> 4785.159000000001
health and I will keep doing my

4793.639 --> 4796.639
show

4796.679 --> 4803.04
and I will entertain the subjects that I

4801.28 --> 4806.5199999999995
damn well

4803.04 --> 4809.719
please and nobody is going to dictate

4806.52 --> 4813.040000000001
anything to me on what I can talk about

4809.719 --> 4813.04
or how I talk about

4813.92 --> 4817.32
it ever

4823.639 --> 4826.639
again

4853.8 --> 4859.400000000001
what is that that's called an Illuminati

4856.08 --> 4859.4
croissant they're

4859.88 --> 4867.0
delicious oh you got an old Channel

4864.0 --> 4867.0
man

4883.56 --> 4886.96
2010

4885.28 --> 4891.0
right and I will still talk about Flat

4886.96 --> 4893.76
Earth I won't just be bickering about

4891.0 --> 4897.36
stupid anti Flat Earth or

4893.76 --> 4899.679
nonsense all the time I'm done with

4897.36 --> 4902.679
that I don't need

4899.679 --> 4902.679
to

4902.92 --> 4908.8
unravel delusions like fractal delusions

4906.719 --> 4911.8
I don't need to do that

4908.8 --> 4914.159000000001
anymore I'm bored with that it gives me

4911.8 --> 4917.4400000000005
a headache it doesn't serve a function

4914.159 --> 4919.5199999999995
and it literally makes me vulnerable to

4917.44 --> 4921.28
[ __ ] demonic possession and I don't

4919.52 --> 4923.0
want to do that

4921.28 --> 4925.8
anymore got

4923.0 --> 4929.4
it I'm

4925.8 --> 4930.76
coming way more directed towards

4929.4 --> 4932.92
spiritual

4930.76 --> 4935.719
matters developing

4932.92 --> 4938.679
that applying the

4935.719 --> 4941.679
technique and doing it

4938.679 --> 4941.679
gloriously

4943.52 --> 4948.400000000001
gloriously

4946.199 --> 4951.199
I'm a Healer

4948.4 --> 4957.08
now I can literally say

4951.199 --> 4960.32
that like my healer I am now a

4957.08 --> 4963.5599999999995
Healer I'm not as disciplined and strong

4960.32 --> 4967.48
as he is and there's still pitfalls for

4963.56 --> 4971.679
me ahead I already know that but I am

4967.48 --> 4973.44
now capable of doing exactly what he's

4971.679 --> 4975.0
done that

4973.44 --> 4978.28
quick

4975.0 --> 4981.08
and I own this and I don't care how much

4978.28 --> 4983.4
I'll be ridiculed for it by a bunch of

4981.08 --> 4983.4
dumb

4983.719 --> 4989.08
asses that don't have the Sens sensory

4986.56 --> 4992.96
to even realize anything about such

4989.08 --> 4995.88
things I know what I can do I do it I

4992.96 --> 5001.08
apply it and I'm getting really really

4995.88 --> 5005.159000000001
strong at it and so it's mostly now

5001.08 --> 5008.5199999999995
about luciferian risk and not aromantic

5005.159 --> 5011.239
there's no death anymore that those

5008.52 --> 5013.76
times are like behind me now now it's

5011.239 --> 5017.04
luciferian now it's the seduction like I

5013.76 --> 5019.96
might overplay myself I might think like

5017.04 --> 5020.8
oh I'm I'm the ruler or whatever with I

5019.96 --> 5024.2390000000005
can

5020.8 --> 5026.76
like grab even more like that that's the

5024.239 --> 5029.759999999999
risk I'm literally facing right now and

5026.76 --> 5029.76
I'm already aware of

5030.0 --> 5035.199
it it's funny because my dad even told

5032.76 --> 5037.96
me that it's pretty amazing

5035.199 --> 5040.32
my dad's really well attuned but I have

5037.96 --> 5044.199
that power now

5040.32 --> 5044.199
like and I'm really good at

5044.32 --> 5049.719
it I'm really good at it yesterday I

5047.8 --> 5053.96
have an

5049.719 --> 5057.04
example I was watching a video Eric de

5053.96 --> 5060.96
which is very interesting as bestto head

5057.04 --> 5063.12
it is a very fascinating video or book

5060.96 --> 5066.32
but it has some really dubious

5063.12 --> 5066.32
luciferian influences

5068.6 --> 5073.159000000001
it does I and I can't even say exactly

5071.12 --> 5074.28
why you could argue why like oh but he's

5073.159 --> 5077.44
like

5074.28 --> 5080.5199999999995
really counter Christian and like it's

5077.44 --> 5083.48
it's like sort of on the edge with it

5080.52 --> 5083.4800000000005
but I was watching

5083.52 --> 5091.6
it and then suddenly

5086.76 --> 5094.56
like I felt it like grab out towards

5091.6 --> 5097.88
me like a luciferian influence Dr to

5094.56 --> 5097.88
grab you that's how it

5099.04 --> 5105.96
happens now these days now that I'm more

5102.92 --> 5107.88
sensitive and stronger and I immediately

5105.96 --> 5112.08
applied the technique like immediately

5107.88 --> 5114.84
did that and neutralized it

5112.08 --> 5117.32
immediately and it's all going so fast

5114.84 --> 5119.04
now well like half a year ago if

5117.32 --> 5121.08
anything like this happened I would like

5119.04 --> 5123.76
not even realize it and just like feel

5121.08 --> 5124.96
off and then call My Healer and he' be

5123.76 --> 5127.52
like yeah yeah there's been this

5124.96 --> 5131.2390000000005
influence I'll remove

5127.52 --> 5133.159000000001
it and I'm like oh oh I so relieved yeah

5131.239 --> 5135.599999999999
now it's like oh I'm watching something

5133.159 --> 5138.239
and it's like I feel the influence

5135.6 --> 5141.1990000000005
immediately like trying to grab me like

5138.239 --> 5145.08
and I'm like oh [ __ ] turn it

5141.199 --> 5148.638999999999
off and boom it's gone it's gone

5145.08 --> 5152.28
like total time span of 2

5148.639 --> 5154.92
minutes instead of hanging around stuff

5152.28 --> 5156.639
hanging around for a week yeah that's

5154.92 --> 5162.28
the difference

5156.639 --> 5163.36
now I'm super fast I can exercise a

5162.28 --> 5167.719
haunted

5163.36 --> 5171.0
room without ever even having seen

5167.719 --> 5174.159
it over the phone through somebody else

5171.0 --> 5177.08
knowing about it in a matter of one

5174.159 --> 5179.5199999999995
minute and extremely

5177.08 --> 5183.0
successful I've never been that strong

5179.52 --> 5184.88
doing that I tried these things like

5183.0 --> 5187.44
around my 20s

5184.88 --> 5190.56
with with decent

5187.44 --> 5193.5199999999995
success but now it's like I just do it

5190.56 --> 5196.1990000000005
in one or two minutes and it's like

5193.52 --> 5198.6
Ultra successful it's so successful that

5196.199 --> 5200.04
the person standing there literally gets

5198.6 --> 5204.400000000001
blinded by

5200.04 --> 5206.88
light out of nowhere

5204.4 --> 5211.5599999999995
yeah I got

5206.88 --> 5215.8
powers powers of the light of God and I

5211.56 --> 5218.84
have to be careful with it not to get to

5215.8 --> 5221.6
arrogant but I am very proud that I've

5218.84 --> 5221.6
arrived to this

5228.159 --> 5233.119
point you can vouch I don't know what

5230.56 --> 5233.119000000001
you're talking

5237.4 --> 5244.92
about I think I maybe one time did it on

5241.0 --> 5248.719
on the show sort of I have explained it

5244.92 --> 5248.719
but there are like weird things about

5251.32 --> 5257.88
it it is

5254.719 --> 5261.88
like risky in

5257.88 --> 5265.84
ways you can explain about

5261.88 --> 5267.679
it show others how to do it but you

5265.84 --> 5273.159000000001
can't

5267.679 --> 5274.84
really fully record it or immortalize it

5273.159 --> 5276.679
in a totem

5274.84 --> 5280.2390000000005
because then if you do

5276.679 --> 5282.96
that you're going to create an

5280.239 --> 5286.08
obstacle an obstacle in the spiritual

5282.96 --> 5286.08
realm that will

5289.44 --> 5294.159
actually

5291.08 --> 5297.159
obstruct the spiritual flow of all

5294.159 --> 5299.96
things which is ever changing and

5297.159 --> 5302.879999999999
dynamic it will start to obstruct the

5299.96 --> 5305.92
spiritual and then drain it and that

5302.88 --> 5309.56
will lead it to a curse first and I'm

5305.92 --> 5311.56
still figuring out how that all works I

5309.56 --> 5313.679
made these mistakes when I was younger

5311.56 --> 5314.6
and my goldsmithing because I was trying

5313.679 --> 5317.76
such

5314.6 --> 5319.679
things like kind of like with a saic

5317.76 --> 5322.4800000000005
mindset like I'm going to make like

5319.679 --> 5326.04
really powerful Jewel with like all this

5322.48 --> 5328.159
effects in it and influence but that was

5326.04 --> 5330.96
a mistake I have disenchanted though

5328.159 --> 5336.04
since then I've let that power

5330.96 --> 5336.04
down because it would just drain on me

5337.6 --> 5343.639
and so I have to be

5340.48 --> 5347.08
careful with it but I can definitely

5343.639 --> 5351.4400000000005
just say like yeah I have leveled up in

5347.08 --> 5353.76
a big way big

5351.44 --> 5356.32
way and nobody's going to take that

5353.76 --> 5358.88
power away from

5356.32 --> 5362.599999999999
me I will not let

5358.88 --> 5362.6
them under any

5363.04 --> 5366.04
circumstance

5376.3 --> 5379.379
[Music]

5381.0 --> 5389.239
also the way I see the dark world has

5385.199 --> 5392.32
changed the way that that experience is

5389.239 --> 5395.08
parallel to me has

5392.32 --> 5397.239
altered which is like for for the first

5395.08 --> 5400.88
time

5397.239 --> 5404.28
ever because it's been very consistent

5400.88 --> 5405.2390000000005
at how I experienced the and remember

5404.28 --> 5408.84
the Dark

5405.239 --> 5410.959999999999
World and there has been a dramatic

5408.84 --> 5413.96
transition Point that's happened

5410.96 --> 5416.96
recently that a compan need all this

5413.96 --> 5416.96
strength and all this

5421.6 --> 5427.280000000001
Focus the amount I can see into the

5424.08 --> 5429.5599999999995
future has been dramatically limited

5427.28 --> 5433.48
which is for the best

5429.56 --> 5435.400000000001
because that I had those powers that I

5433.48 --> 5437.759999999999
did

5435.4 --> 5442.119
that was a

5437.76 --> 5447.4800000000005
mistake it was basically esoteric

5442.119 --> 5447.48
mistake not trusting God with my

5449.08 --> 5455.92
faith and that has caused a lot of hurt

5452.239 --> 5455.919999999999
and scares

5457.4 --> 5461.04
and that has changed so

5462.6 --> 5469.6
now I don't really see as much into the

5467.28 --> 5473.719
future but I

5469.6 --> 5476.08
can get the information more

5473.719 --> 5478.0
accurately it'll just be out of nowhere

5476.08 --> 5480.0
it will not be hanging around in my

5478.0 --> 5482.92
Consciousness it will

5480.0 --> 5485.92
just be there when I need

5482.92 --> 5485.92
it

5486.04 --> 5491.44
I've gotten very close to the akashic

5488.6 --> 5491.4400000000005
library in my

5492.88 --> 5501.719
state it's just not continually in my

5498.44 --> 5503.04
conscious it's more in my subconscious

5501.719 --> 5507.32
but that

5503.04 --> 5511.639
way I can get the information

5507.32 --> 5515.84
better so for what I do I Now function

5511.639 --> 5515.84
way more optimally

5516.88 --> 5522.2390000000005
compared to even a year ago and I'm all

5519.88 --> 5523.39
very happy about it and nothing's going

5522.239 --> 5532.349999999999
to take that away from

5523.39 --> 5532.35
[Music]

5533.119 --> 5536.5199999999995
me you can

5539.719 --> 5545.84
try but you'll be

5542.84 --> 5545.84
sorry

5569.4 --> 5577.879999999999
do I visualize the cleansing

5572.84 --> 5581.04
no although the visualizations do come

5577.88 --> 5581.04
alongside what I

5581.36 --> 5588.44
do I don't have to focus or concentrate

5584.719 --> 5588.44
to achieve anything

5599.159 --> 5605.759999999999
virtually it's like I'm more like just

5601.96 --> 5605.76
in direct contact with the other side

5609.8 --> 5618.04
down there's no translation

5614.04 --> 5620.8
bit that there's no more in between you

5618.04 --> 5623.6
see the other side and then there's like

5620.8 --> 5628.360000000001
an in between State like a a translation

5623.6 --> 5631.4800000000005
a communication from the other side to

5628.36 --> 5637.5199999999995
latch on to it to make it more palpable

5631.48 --> 5642.0
and palatable for the typical Earthly

5637.52 --> 5645.400000000001
conscious to grasp it and that that

5642.0 --> 5649.0
transition state that in between

5645.4 --> 5651.159
phase of this process isn't required

5649.0 --> 5656.08
anymore it's just I don't need it

5651.159 --> 5656.08
anymore I could just do it instantly now

5662.719 --> 5665.719
instantly

5665.85 --> 5671.92
[Music]

5668.159 --> 5674.239
and it's also allowed me to really

5671.92 --> 5677.4800000000005
improve my

5674.239 --> 5681.5599999999995
memory like dramatically I my

5677.48 --> 5686.04
memory at times works so

5681.56 --> 5686.04
well I can't believe

5686.6 --> 5693.280000000001
it I've I've always had memory issues in

5690.48 --> 5697.36
my life not just like Amnesia in inter

5693.28 --> 5700.719
tur model in in distress but just like

5697.36 --> 5706.239
hard to access like think back diff my

5700.719 --> 5706.2390000000005
memories become so much more better it

5708.04 --> 5713.639
is almost

5710.44 --> 5716.44
Tic and I'm not used to that I've never

5713.639 --> 5722.119
really had an tic

5716.44 --> 5722.119
memory and now it seems like at times I

5722.639 --> 5729.52
do

5724.639 --> 5729.52
and it's fast it's very very

5747.96 --> 5756.96
fast all right but overall it's great

5752.44 --> 5756.96
because this there's no more Panic

5770.719 --> 5777.08
[ __ ] I could argue

5774.4 --> 5782.36
that when this

5777.08 --> 5786.6
new level was unlocked to me that the

5782.36 --> 5789.5199999999995
demons basically jumped onto that room

5786.6 --> 5792.360000000001
and tried to get at

5789.52 --> 5794.56
me but I've cleared them out and now

5792.36 --> 5796.88
that extra room is filled up with my

5794.56 --> 5799.04
spirit that has integrated and I'm

5796.88 --> 5802.84
effectively leveled up and I'm really

5799.04 --> 5802.84
feeling it it's like so

5805.28 --> 5811.92
palpable I just have to figure out like

5809.0 --> 5814.4
what I am in relation to the world

5811.92 --> 5818.28
now that's a part that I still have to

5814.4 --> 5819.159
figure out like now that I know I can do

5818.28 --> 5823.04
these

5819.159 --> 5825.28
things what do I actually do with these

5823.04 --> 5827.96
things other than continue what I've

5825.28 --> 5829.44
been doing like doing my show talking

5827.96 --> 5832.84
with people

5829.44 --> 5836.96
and basically letting

5832.84 --> 5841.360000000001
my my Powers rub off on people that are

5836.96 --> 5844.2390000000005
also it going in that direction because

5841.36 --> 5846.96
it is in a way weird that

5844.239 --> 5849.5599999999995
at times when I'm really in the

5846.96 --> 5852.84
flow other people that tune in and

5849.56 --> 5856.320000000001
listen or even converse with me they get

5852.84 --> 5858.360000000001
pulled up to that level as well to a bit

5856.32 --> 5860.759999999999
so it's like in my presence you like

5858.36 --> 5860.759999999999
become

5862.44 --> 5868.159
more it's an

5864.679 --> 5872.1990000000005
effect that effect has been there for a

5868.159 --> 5872.199
while it's become even

5872.44 --> 5877.48
stronger

5873.96 --> 5879.32
some of you in the chat might be

5877.48 --> 5881.759999999999
enjoying that a

5879.32 --> 5884.44
little might be the reason why you do

5881.76 --> 5884.4400000000005
like to come

5885.719 --> 5888.92
back and

5895.92 --> 5901.52
interact the Earth is

5898.4 --> 5903.96
flat yeah well why are they even saying

5901.52 --> 5906.88
it they're I feel they're just saying it

5903.96 --> 5906.88
just to trigger

5908.36 --> 5914.598999999999
Ballers right it's not to teach people

5912.119 --> 5917.159
that are open-minded it's to go after

5914.599 --> 5917.159000000001
those that are

5917.92 --> 5922.599
closed-minded and it's been like that

5919.88 --> 5925.84
for a while and it is

5922.599 --> 5925.84
tedious to

5926.159 --> 5932.0
me I mean I like a good explanation

5929.159 --> 5935.44
technical explanation every now and then

5932.0 --> 5939.04
but that's like yeah give me like five

5935.44 --> 5941.678999999999
minutes in a week right I don't have to

5939.04 --> 5944.76
hear that an hour every damn day and

5941.679 --> 5944.76
that's all only

5955.88 --> 5962.679
that all

5958.84 --> 5965.360000000001
right but uh yeah it's not my problem

5962.679 --> 5965.36
anymore

5970.83 --> 5978.649
[Music]

6007.239 --> 6012.839999999999
right anyway I love hanging around Earth

6008.8 --> 6016.599
Awakening channel it's great over

6012.84 --> 6019.76
there and uh I think he's like Nathan's

6016.599 --> 6022.32
now going against Wht it on

6019.76 --> 6024.0
it right

6022.32 --> 6025.92
now

6024.0 --> 6028.96
and so he's going to be whining about

6025.92 --> 6031.679
ether and oh yeah wit it talks about

6028.96 --> 6031.679
ether and all

6032.04 --> 6039.44
that and I've tried to explain

6035.88 --> 6041.599
it he like it's just a thing that which

6039.44 --> 6044.32
it does he's kind of compartmentalized

6041.599 --> 6048.4400000000005
it and he's not obsessed with

6044.32 --> 6050.5199999999995
it like yesterday I had well Duke Nukem

6048.44 --> 6052.799999999999
you were there there was a whole bunch

6050.52 --> 6053.96
of conversation we had and witd and me

6052.8 --> 6054.88
were like

6053.96 --> 6057.92
re

6054.88 --> 6062.159000000001
like he's actually kind of a good

6057.92 --> 6064.639
friend he's he's very understanding and

6062.159 --> 6067.44
wise when it comes to spiritual matters

6064.639 --> 6069.719
like that's really s surprisingly good

6067.44 --> 6073.08
at it

6069.719 --> 6076.32
and I can trust him it's just that he's

6073.08 --> 6077.88
also into ether and well he knows my

6076.32 --> 6081.88
opinion about like we we openly

6077.88 --> 6085.2390000000005
discussed it like yeah I I have logical

6081.88 --> 6085.2390000000005
problems with it

6085.36 --> 6092.36
like it's not it doesn't really work and

6089.08 --> 6095.28
I'd wish you'd recognize it but I'm not

6092.36 --> 6098.839999999999
going to like attack you over it and wit

6095.28 --> 6102.119
it was very understanding about it and

6098.84 --> 6104.56
like yeah I think we're friends or

6102.119 --> 6106.5199999999995
something it does feel it like it it

6104.56 --> 6108.119000000001
like oh cool wit in the room oh that's

6106.52 --> 6109.719
that's great that that means the

6108.119 --> 6112.0
conversation is probably going to be

6109.719 --> 6112.0
pretty

6112.239 --> 6117.799999999999
interesting

6114.04 --> 6120.08
right but yeah Nathan Nathan just wants

6117.8 --> 6123.04
to take down the

6120.08 --> 6126.36
ether right that's all their focus it's

6123.04 --> 6129.84
just taking down taking down this pseudo

6126.36 --> 6129.839999999999
science and that's all they care

6133.92 --> 6139.0
about like to hear a conversation

6136.239 --> 6141.239
between you guys about

6139.0 --> 6144.44
light

6141.239 --> 6147.879999999999
yeah isn't ether just no don't even

6144.44 --> 6152.678999999999
freaking go there Pon don't even go

6147.88 --> 6153.76
there don't ask that question isn't it

6152.679 --> 6157.119
just

6153.76 --> 6157.119000000001
no shut

6158.159 --> 6164.598999999999
up if you don't even know what the hell

6160.84 --> 6164.599
it is then just don't even

6167.28 --> 6174.44
ask ether is an aberration it is it's a

6171.119 --> 6175.639
misconception based aberration it's

6174.44 --> 6179.96
a

6175.639 --> 6181.400000000001
giant string of incoherent traits that

6179.96 --> 6183.84
are tied in

6181.4 --> 6186.36
together through scatter

6183.84 --> 6188.639
gunning and they're not tied together

6186.36 --> 6191.679
it's an aberration that's all it is it's

6188.639 --> 6194.159000000001
a misconception aberration that is very

6191.679 --> 6196.32
suggestible that have been entertained

6194.159 --> 6199.04
throughout history by several prominent

6196.32 --> 6201.48
figures and none of them claimed

6199.04 --> 6206.36
scientific validity to it

6201.48 --> 6210.839999999999
ever that's it it's an admiration it's a

6206.36 --> 6213.28
weird trinket a weird mental trinket a a

6210.84 --> 6214.92
consideration that you can never prove

6213.28 --> 6217.92
and that's what it is it's what it

6214.92 --> 6222.36
always will be that's my definition of

6217.92 --> 6227.119
it and yeah a lot of its traits a lot of

6222.36 --> 6228.799999999999
its trinkets within the claim are

6227.119 --> 6232.719
interesting they're

6228.8 --> 6234.76
interesting man-made phenomenon that are

6232.719 --> 6237.199
worth studying it's like yeah there's a

6234.76 --> 6240.92
lot of Fascination that accompanies the

6237.199 --> 6243.719
conception of ether but it isn't a thing

6240.92 --> 6246.36
though it's rather a halfhazard

6243.719 --> 6249.32
collection of weird man-made device

6246.36 --> 6252.0
based phenomenon that's what it is yeah

6249.32 --> 6255.599
that's what ether is is when you start

6252.0 --> 6258.599
describing it that is what it

6255.599 --> 6258.599
is

6259.119 --> 6269.04
done to claim it is a uniform whole

6263.719 --> 6272.88
thing and everything is tied into it is

6269.04 --> 6277.159
aberant it's literally like the force in

6272.88 --> 6280.04
Star Wars yeah they made it into the

6277.159 --> 6281.839999999999
force of Star Wars it's the same things

6280.04 --> 6286.679
that are said about the

6281.84 --> 6290.639
force by Yoda and about OB from Obi-Wan

6286.679 --> 6293.84
Kenobi is what is said about ether

6290.639 --> 6297.76
within it yeah

6293.84 --> 6301.1990000000005
it's an illusion it's

6297.76 --> 6304.08
just a fairy tale lure

6301.199 --> 6306.799999999999
story if you really study it you'll find

6304.08 --> 6310.08
out it's a collection of man-made

6306.8 --> 6311.679
phenomenon trinkets that aren't related

6310.08 --> 6316.4
but are

6311.679 --> 6316.4
suggestable and that's it that's all it

6317.04 --> 6322.56
is see now I didn't even have to like

6320.0 --> 6325.48
attack it I don't have to say oh don't

6322.56 --> 6328.2390000000005
talk about it it's all

6325.48 --> 6331.119
stupid it's just like yeah you could

6328.239 --> 6334.839999999999
just honestly describe what it is

6331.119 --> 6337.119
and and then that should subside your

6334.84 --> 6339.84
obsession with

6337.119 --> 6341.5599999999995
it yeah once you really identify it it's

6339.84 --> 6343.679
like yeah it's an aberration well then

6341.56 --> 6346.119000000001
you shouldn't need to be fascinated by

6343.679 --> 6347.92
it anymore just like yeah gravity oh

6346.119 --> 6349.639
everybody gravity it has to be something

6347.92 --> 6351.719
like no it doesn't it's an aberration

6349.639 --> 6354.679
it's a suggestion there's no even

6351.719 --> 6359.04
there's not even a real claim

6354.679 --> 6361.2390000000005
oh so just leave it alone then yeah just

6359.04 --> 6363.199
leave it alone it's it's literally

6361.239 --> 6366.08
nothing it's a

6363.199 --> 6368.4
ghost it's a ghost you can't never catch

6366.08 --> 6370.32
an aberration that's why I call that

6368.4 --> 6373.159
aberration it's a ghost you can never

6370.32 --> 6376.09
catch but it will always lure you try to

6373.159 --> 6379.228999999999
lure you in but you can never catch

6376.09 --> 6379.229
[Music]

6380.599 --> 6387.159000000001
it and just like gravity ether is an

6385.4 --> 6389.5199999999995
aberration the

6387.159 --> 6392.719
intangible yeah but not just the

6389.52 --> 6394.2390000000005
intangible also the

6392.719 --> 6396.08
unfalsifiable

6394.239 --> 6399.5199999999995
unfalsifiable and

6396.08 --> 6402.44
intangible so it becomes purely mystical

6399.52 --> 6403.639
in that sense there are intangible

6402.44 --> 6406.48
things like

6403.639 --> 6409.1990000000005
information but they are falsifiable you

6406.48 --> 6410.638999999999
can prove that it is a real thing that's

6409.199 --> 6413.36
just

6410.639 --> 6416.28
intangible but when it's intangible and

6413.36 --> 6420.199
unfalsifiable you can never test it well

6416.28 --> 6420.199
then the only thing you have is pure

6422.08 --> 6429.719
mysticism something that you think but

6426.04 --> 6432.119
you can never grasp it nor prove it

6429.719 --> 6432.119
that's

6439.599 --> 6443.92
mysticism

6441.84 --> 6446.4800000000005
right

6443.92 --> 6449.36
is double slit experiment mysticism too

6446.48 --> 6451.959999999999
no it isn't no because it is falsifiable

6449.36 --> 6451.96
and it is

6455.28 --> 6462.639
tangible no no experiment is mysticism

6458.52 --> 6462.639
if it's an experiment it's not

6463.96 --> 6471.28
mysticism yeah and it is this is a very

6468.119 --> 6471.28
strange thing to say duke

6471.84 --> 6474.84
nuk

6477.04 --> 6482.0
if it's an experiment well that means

6479.0 --> 6485.8
there is a a falsifiability to it

6482.0 --> 6490.08
because it if it isn't falsifiable then

6485.8 --> 6491.599
it can't be an experiment science is per

6490.08 --> 6495.28
definition

6491.599 --> 6495.28
falsifiability that is what it

6497.119 --> 6501.28
does that's the whole point of

6501.76 --> 6504.76
it

6506.6 --> 6509.81
[Music]

6509.92 --> 6514.52
right and there's definitely a natural

6512.76 --> 6518.719
phenomenon happening within the double

6514.52 --> 6518.719
slit experiment that you can very

6521.52 --> 6525.52
manipulate are video games

6531.719 --> 6538.44
intangible

6534.52 --> 6541.320000000001
yeah well virtual they're virtual right

6538.44 --> 6541.32
just like word

6541.44 --> 6546.719
games yeah I mean yeah that's a comp

6545.48 --> 6549.119
yeah that's a kind of almost like a

6546.719 --> 6549.119
trick

6552.32 --> 6557.0
question somebody's going ins San

6557.159 --> 6560.5199999999995
how please

6561.719 --> 6568.639
clarify

6564.639 --> 6568.639
okay can be more

6576.4 --> 6580.28
specific is he just being

6582.8 --> 6588.52
angry I mean insane is kind of

6585.96 --> 6591.639
a

6588.52 --> 6594.639
very specific word

6591.639 --> 6594.639
so

6616.76 --> 6621.360000000001
so

6617.679 --> 6621.36
yeah video games

6621.639 --> 6627.88
are technically not intangible you're

6625.04 --> 6627.88
interacting with

6632.719 --> 6638.639
them but you could say that a virtual

6635.88 --> 6641.400000000001
world that is created through suggestion

6638.639 --> 6644.76
and graphics and everything that the

6641.4 --> 6648.28
virtual world that your mind creates

6644.76 --> 6649.280000000001
with the help of the graphics and sounds

6648.28 --> 6652.119
is

6649.28 --> 6654.04
intangible but that's only the image

6652.119 --> 6657.36
that is

6654.04 --> 6660.639
the story as it were so the story in a

6657.36 --> 6663.5199999999995
video game and the the idea of the world

6660.639 --> 6666.400000000001
that it plays out in that is intangible

6663.52 --> 6670.4400000000005
but the video game is just it's a

6666.4 --> 6670.44
program you interact with the

6670.8 --> 6675.1990000000005
program you can turn it off you can turn

6673.159 --> 6679.199
it

6675.199 --> 6679.199
on so it's not really

6681.56 --> 6684.56
intangible

6698.03 --> 6702.28
[Music]

6700.679 --> 6705.04
transfers the game World well when

6702.28 --> 6708.599
you're thinking about the Game

6705.04 --> 6711.239
World you create a virtual

6708.599 --> 6714.719
representation of it in your mind and

6711.239 --> 6717.638999999999
what you imagine that to be and what the

6714.719 --> 6721.159
consistency of how the world Works Etc

6717.639 --> 6723.88
so you fill it in that part is in

6721.159 --> 6726.5199999999995
tangible that's basically your

6723.88 --> 6728.92
fantasy parallel

6726.52 --> 6730.88
constructing like that is part of what

6728.92 --> 6733.639
makes video games enjoyable and it's

6730.88 --> 6736.1990000000005
part of what makes reading a book

6733.639 --> 6738.52
enjoyable is that you in your mind using

6736.199 --> 6741.5199999999995
your fantasy create a parallel

6738.52 --> 6745.719
construction to build up a a

6741.52 --> 6749.52
cohesive idea of what the book or the

6745.719 --> 6753.159
video game represents the its world

6749.52 --> 6756.040000000001
right that world is not literally there

6753.159 --> 6757.0
but it is created in the mind with the

6756.04 --> 6759.599
help of

6757.0 --> 6762.92
fantasy as you engage as you read the

6759.599 --> 6766.599
book it's just a bunch of words but

6762.92 --> 6768.96
those words combined give suggestions

6766.599 --> 6771.04
and you take those suggestions and then

6768.96 --> 6774.76
try to picture what it's

6771.04 --> 6778.04
like and that's a

6774.76 --> 6783.0
virtual back piece of back engineering

6778.04 --> 6783.0
about that virtual world that part is

6792.79 --> 6796.1
[Music]

6801.44 --> 6804.44
intangible

6823.56 --> 6826.400000000001
Pro

6826.76 --> 6831.679
proced

6828.56 --> 6833.320000000001
yeah wave function yeah debatable yeah

6831.679 --> 6834.8
that's the whole weird thing right the

6833.32 --> 6838.32
wave

6834.8 --> 6841.56
function the wave function of light is a

6838.32 --> 6844.679
giant word cluster

6841.56 --> 6847.159000000001
screw it is a

6844.679 --> 6849.92
terrible set of

6847.159 --> 6854.44
circumstances that have

6849.92 --> 6857.96
caused the quantum mechan mechanics

6854.44 --> 6860.239
people to call it even a wave function

6857.96 --> 6861.36
it's it's a terrible thing that that

6860.239 --> 6863.48
that it

6861.36 --> 6866.44
is

6863.48 --> 6867.5599999999995
like that because because it was called

6866.44 --> 6870.96
a wave

6867.56 --> 6872.92
function there has been a persistent

6870.96 --> 6875.84
misinterpretation about the very nature

6872.92 --> 6877.639
of light because of it because the wave

6875.84 --> 6880.0
function is purely mathematical it

6877.639 --> 6884.32
doesn't have anything to do with

6880.0 --> 6885.92
actual physical physics wave properties

6884.32 --> 6888.679
nothing

6885.92 --> 6891.4
whatsoever that's the whole problem that

6888.679 --> 6893.36
since there is a wave function that's

6891.4 --> 6896.759999999999
caused byra

6893.36 --> 6901.48
with light since that part there has

6896.76 --> 6903.8
been a false claim of light being a wave

6901.48 --> 6905.199
that's where it all started it did it

6903.8 --> 6907.599
started with

6905.199 --> 6911.4
that and then oh but it's also a

6907.599 --> 6915.8
particle oh have a wave wave particle

6911.4 --> 6918.44
duality it's all garbage it's all total

6915.8 --> 6922.04
nonsense it's

6918.44 --> 6924.799999999999
misleading light isn't a wave it doesn't

6922.04 --> 6929.639
function function like a

6924.8 --> 6929.639
wave but it does have unique

6929.88 --> 6935.4800000000005
properties that make it different from

6933.04 --> 6940.159
matter from other

6935.48 --> 6944.678999999999
things it just does different from

6940.159 --> 6946.759999999999
electrons even yeah light has a unique

6944.679 --> 6949.719
property when it comes to defraction

6946.76 --> 6952.639
which I call and I don't understand why

6949.719 --> 6957.119
it hasn't been historically called

6952.639 --> 6960.679
defraction Cascade it's it defract into

6957.119 --> 6964.5599999999995
more than three bands uniquely like is

6960.679 --> 6965.84
the only thing that defacts into more

6964.56 --> 6968.639
than three

6965.84 --> 6972.4800000000005
bands That's Unique it's Unique

6968.639 --> 6975.84
defraction property unique to light it's

6972.48 --> 6979.079
not because it's a wave it's a unique

6975.84 --> 6982.56
defraction property defraction Cascade

6979.079 --> 6986.159
more than three bands unique to life

6982.56 --> 6989.04
only light does that yeah that's a

6986.159 --> 6994.199
unique separate phenomenon that has just

6989.04 --> 6997.32
been totally ignored not even yeah not

6994.199 --> 6999.5599999999995
even named I had to name it I name it

6997.32 --> 7002.36
defraction Cascade it is a unique

6999.56 --> 7006.0
phenomenon of light involving

7002.36 --> 7009.32
defraction it hasn't even been named in

7006.0 --> 7012.88
physics okay how [ __ ] ridiculous is

7009.32 --> 7015.44
that it's not even been named

7012.88 --> 7019.119
a unique phenomenon natural unique

7015.44 --> 7021.239
phenomenon how come they didn't name it

7019.119 --> 7024.44
well it seems like they did name it in

7021.239 --> 7026.959999999999
favor of inserting a misunderstanding

7024.44 --> 7029.0
about light being a [ __ ] wave so they

7026.96 --> 7032.4
could endlessly squirt about the stupid

7029.0 --> 7032.4
particle wave Duality

7033.159 --> 7038.32
nonsense and science been has been

7035.639 --> 7041.2390000000005
convoluted concerning light ever since

7038.32 --> 7044.639
is like irresolvable convoluted because

7041.239 --> 7047.759999999999
of that and I think they did it on

7044.639 --> 7051.28
purpose I really do I really think it's

7047.76 --> 7054.119000000001
been done on purpose it's deliberate

7051.28 --> 7056.44
misinformation placement within the

7054.119 --> 7061.5599999999995
knowledge of physics that has been

7056.44 --> 7061.5599999999995
perpetuated throughout universities and

7071.119 --> 7074.119
everything

7081.75 --> 7084.829
[Music]

7085.56 --> 7090.360000000001
Right light is not a wave light is

7088.599 --> 7092.599
arguably not even a particle you could

7090.36 --> 7096.36
think of it as a particle and when you

7092.599 --> 7099.400000000001
take a photon which is basically a Quant

7096.36 --> 7101.28
light an amount of light the minimum

7099.4 --> 7104.799999999999
amount that is required in order for the

7101.28 --> 7104.8
photo Electric effect to

7104.92 --> 7109.92
occur you could think of that as a

7106.96 --> 7112.92
particle and use that in in tests and

7109.92 --> 7114.28
use it calculatory and all that and hey

7112.92 --> 7119.84
there

7114.28 --> 7123.5199999999995
are not wave but almost to be considered

7119.84 --> 7126.4400000000005
like wave properties there's certain

7123.52 --> 7127.96
frequency aspect of light like

7126.44 --> 7131.839999999999
polarization

7127.96 --> 7135.119
depolarization where you can alter it

7131.84 --> 7137.8
and how they describe this alteration

7135.119 --> 7140.28
this spectrum of ability that you can

7137.8 --> 7142.28
apply to light changing its color

7140.28 --> 7146.84
changing its polarization all these

7142.28 --> 7149.679
aspects they express it in wave property

7146.84 --> 7152.92
so they say like oh you just speed up

7149.679 --> 7155.639
the wave you slow down the wave you you

7152.92 --> 7159.76
you you cut it down the amplitude you

7155.639 --> 7163.56
heighten the amplitude based on it

7159.76 --> 7165.079000000001
assumed to be a wave it's so baked in

7163.56 --> 7167.88
it's baked

7165.079 --> 7169.5199999999995
in through the the very mechanical

7167.88 --> 7171.8
descriptions of what they do with it

7169.52 --> 7173.4800000000005
with an engineering that it has to be a

7171.8 --> 7176.719
wave and that it is the wave that is

7173.48 --> 7179.159
altered and this is falsely claimed

7176.719 --> 7182.56
because it isn't a wave it's just a

7179.159 --> 7187.719
unique Spectrum based property of this

7182.56 --> 7187.719
light that isn't a wave that is arguably

7188.639 --> 7192.8
instantaneous but they're altering

7190.84 --> 7194.92
something about it

7192.8 --> 7199.119000000001
well not the wave property though

7194.92 --> 7202.4
because it is in the wave yeah so the

7199.119 --> 7204.679
mistake is just continually ingrained in

7202.4 --> 7206.879999999999
every step of dealing with light and how

7204.679 --> 7208.1990000000005
to regard it within engineering it's all

7206.88 --> 7211.599
it's a wave it's a wave property it's

7208.199 --> 7214.48
wave wave no it isn't a [ __ ] wave

7211.599 --> 7218.0
it's not a wave you don't know what the

7214.48 --> 7221.718999999999
[ __ ] it is but it is not a wave provably

7218.0 --> 7224.719
not a wave and it doesn't have a speed

7221.719 --> 7227.84
it only has an assumed speed and an

7224.719 --> 7231.96
alteration to the assumed speed not a

7227.84 --> 7234.679
measured altered speed just a

7231.96 --> 7236.88
change it doesn't have a speed it isn't

7234.679 --> 7236.88
a

7237.119 --> 7242.48
wave but you can think of all these

7239.44 --> 7247.079
things and Engineering certainly has

7242.48 --> 7250.199
made it very suggestible to be that

7247.079 --> 7253.159
falsely not a wave not a

7250.199 --> 7255.638999999999
particle instantaneous

7253.159 --> 7258.28
potentially infinitely divisible I've

7255.639 --> 7260.04
devised a test on how to potentially

7258.28 --> 7261.88
prove it it's just that I haven't had

7260.04 --> 7264.92
the real opportunity in the physical

7261.88 --> 7266.639
world to actually carry it out even if I

7264.92 --> 7269.159
did carry it out and try to present it

7266.639 --> 7273.32
they'd probably send me to a nut house

7269.159 --> 7275.0
cuz I'm not allowed to reveal that fact

7273.32 --> 7278.5199999999995
about the nature of light that has been

7275.0 --> 7283.0
convoluted for over a 100

7278.52 --> 7286.2390000000005
years why else would they perpetuate the

7283.0 --> 7288.0
misconception for a century like that

7286.239 --> 7291.0
well not for just some random guy to

7288.0 --> 7293.599
subtly prove him all wrong I don't even

7291.0 --> 7295.96
have a University degree how dare you oh

7293.599 --> 7298.679
you're just a crazy person yeah I know

7295.96 --> 7298.679
how that's going to

7305.96 --> 7313.28
go yeah frequency there is no

7309.84 --> 7315.8
frequency Kung Fu kitten

7313.28 --> 7318.48
and there's no speed there's no

7315.8 --> 7321.4400000000005
frequency because frequency means a

7318.48 --> 7321.44
motion and there isn't

7324.84 --> 7334.88
aemotion light is not a moving

7329.88 --> 7334.88
thing it is an instantaneously

7334.96 --> 7340.719
manifesting beam or Crystal

7338.28 --> 7343.84
arguably and it is instantaneous and

7340.719 --> 7343.84
nothing slows it down

7344.92 --> 7349.84
but you could think of it as being

7346.88 --> 7352.4400000000005
slowed down you could presuppose that it

7349.84 --> 7356.400000000001
is being slowed down or sped up and that

7352.44 --> 7359.799999999999
changes the overall results the property

7356.4 --> 7360.92
results but there is no speed and there

7359.8 --> 7364.52
is no

7360.92 --> 7364.52
frequency it is not a

7370.0 --> 7375.719
wave traffic is like a essentially a

7372.84 --> 7380.1990000000005
wave of series of yeah so is a the wave

7375.719 --> 7383.32
of the ocean but those are actually

7380.199 --> 7386.48
measurably physical things that are

7383.32 --> 7389.88
measurably provably moving in wave

7386.48 --> 7392.4
patterns like sound is a wave it's a

7389.88 --> 7392.400000000001
wave of

7392.639 --> 7401.0
air yeah being divided in a certain way

7396.639 --> 7404.92
those are measurably provably waves yeah

7401.0 --> 7409.679
light has no such thing no such

7404.92 --> 7409.679
proof it is just assumed to

7430.719 --> 7435.88
be

7432.36 --> 7435.88
I have to put this in the title

7438.119 --> 7443.159
now I just cut on the Avatar last air

7454.23 --> 7462.049999999999
[Music]

7460.719 --> 7465.319
bender

7462.05 --> 7465.319
[Music]

7490.639 --> 7493.639
for

7495.559 --> 7498.2390000000005
yeah that should

7502.52 --> 7507.1990000000005
fit spectroscopy what the hell does that

7505.28 --> 7510.199
have to do with

7507.199 --> 7510.199
anything

7510.71 --> 7516.999
[Music]

7520.639 --> 7523.639
h

7527.239 --> 7530.28
that's interesting debatable yeah

7528.88 --> 7532.4400000000005
there's a lot of

7530.28 --> 7536.5199999999995
man-made

7532.44 --> 7536.5199999999995
things it's all quite

7538.4 --> 7544.558999999999
magical but I mean all those things do

7541.28 --> 7547.119
that they are the result of

7544.559 --> 7549.04
engineering so there's no more natural

7547.119 --> 7550.639
phenomenon that actually takes place

7549.04 --> 7552.88
that you could use

7550.639 --> 7556.719
to

7552.88 --> 7559.159000000001
redefine the foundations of physics you

7556.719 --> 7561.559
see that's the issue isn't it that's the

7559.159 --> 7564.0
entire issue of

7561.559 --> 7566.320000000001
it that's what all these Engineers just

7564.0 --> 7569.92
love to oh we look at what we did with

7566.32 --> 7571.88
our ggs and their electronics and oh

7569.92 --> 7576.4800000000005
it's all that means it's all different

7571.88 --> 7579.599
and the ether is like no no no it's all

7576.48 --> 7582.32
man-made device based phenomenon there's

7579.599 --> 7584.8
no natural phenomenon

7582.32 --> 7587.96
there's something happening for sure

7584.8 --> 7589.96
yeah it's not going to change the

7587.96 --> 7592.0
foundational understanding of physics

7589.96 --> 7596.36
because the only way you can do

7592.0 --> 7599.639
that through naturally occurring

7596.36 --> 7602.92
phenomenon so keep fiddling around with

7599.639 --> 7605.8
your gadgets it's all very fascinating

7602.92 --> 7608.559
and it is fasc it is truly

7605.8 --> 7611.04
fascinating it doesn't prove anything

7608.559 --> 7612.360000000001
though just proves that if you fiddle

7611.04 --> 7614.76
around with

7612.36 --> 7616.679
gadgets electronics and light and all

7614.76 --> 7618.639
that yeah you're going to see some

7616.679 --> 7621.2390000000005
really bizarre things that are very

7618.639 --> 7623.32
interesting and worth exploring for

7621.239 --> 7625.36
engineering

7623.32 --> 7627.199
purposes it doesn't change the

7625.36 --> 7630.839999999999
foundational understanding of physics

7627.199 --> 7630.839999999999
though and it never

7631.84 --> 7638.04
will hello flatter Sage good to see

7635.0 --> 7639.199
you you're up early enough for the show

7638.04 --> 7643.5199999999995
yeah

7639.199 --> 7643.5199999999995
good good for you

7648.15 --> 7651.37
[Music]

7653.81 --> 7656.999000000001
[Music]

7665.95 --> 7669.2699999999995
[Music]

7670.44 --> 7673.44
for

7675.0 --> 7681.04
right but I mean look

7677.719 --> 7685.079
light light is the real final frontier

7681.04 --> 7688.04
or well thus far I consider it within

7685.079 --> 7690.96
physics it is the last Bastion

7688.04 --> 7693.92
of it's The Fifth

7690.96 --> 7698.559
Element arguably literally it's the

7693.92 --> 7701.92
fifth light is The Fifth Element I'm

7698.559 --> 7705.0
there and I'm really ready to figure out

7701.92 --> 7707.52
and I have my ideas about it I think

7705.0 --> 7710.52
light is an infinitely

7707.52 --> 7712.360000000001
divisible instantaneous

7710.52 --> 7715.0
beam

7712.36 --> 7718.96
and it

7715.0 --> 7721.76
defies matter in many

7718.96 --> 7724.28
ways right because how do we know there

7721.76 --> 7727.599
is light there well through its

7724.28 --> 7732.8
interaction with matter right that's how

7727.599 --> 7734.96
we know it's there well what if it's

7732.8 --> 7738.2390000000005
quantitatively too

7734.96 --> 7739.8
little for matter to

7738.239 --> 7743.678999999999
respond

7739.8 --> 7747.4800000000005
yeah how do you know that a

7743.679 --> 7751.719
photon is the minimum amount because of

7747.48 --> 7755.5199999999995
the photoelectric effect responding to

7751.719 --> 7759.4
that minimum amount but what if

7755.52 --> 7761.4400000000005
you had less than that amount well then

7759.4 --> 7762.96
the photoelectric effect wouldn't occur

7761.44 --> 7765.799999999999
yeah but how do you know that there

7762.96 --> 7768.36
isn't light there then it's not

7765.8 --> 7772.4400000000005
responding yeah well isn't the the issue

7768.36 --> 7777.679
then the limitation of the

7772.44 --> 7777.678999999999
matter and not the light you

7779.04 --> 7784.559
see and you can falsify this I've had an

7782.719 --> 7787.32
idea about it i' I've explained this

7784.559 --> 7789.400000000001
years ago it's been kind of ignored for

7787.32 --> 7792.36
a long time I laid this down with the

7789.4 --> 7794.558999999999
FED guys they were interested and then

7792.36 --> 7798.119
they ignored

7794.559 --> 7801.079000000001
it they just ignored

7798.119 --> 7802.96
it like nobody gives a [ __ ] anymore

7801.079 --> 7805.639
apparently well I still give a [ __ ] and

7802.96 --> 7808.96
one day I will try to actually prove it

7805.639 --> 7812.719
I'll just need two Arun pump

7808.96 --> 7816.84
lasers and then I will attempt to make

7812.719 --> 7819.079
them fire at exactly the same location

7816.84 --> 7822.32
on a photo electric

7819.079 --> 7825.079
plate the classical first ver the

7822.32 --> 7828.32
minimum amount first test it with a

7825.079 --> 7830.799999999999
photon a single Photon see if they both

7828.32 --> 7834.5199999999995
arrive at exactly the same

7830.8 --> 7839.8
spot and then figure out if I can make

7834.52 --> 7843.88
the Argon pump lasers fire less than a

7839.8 --> 7847.679
photon worth of energy like let's say

7843.88 --> 7850.079
3/4 then if I'm correct if you fire them

7847.679 --> 7851.559
individually there will be no registry

7850.079 --> 7854.799999999999
there will be no response from the

7851.559 --> 7857.119000000001
photoelectric plate but what if you then

7854.8 --> 7860.400000000001
fire them

7857.119 --> 7864.04
simultaneously at exactly the same

7860.4 --> 7869.44
spot will there be a photoelectric

7864.04 --> 7869.44
effect happening when you have

7869.719 --> 7876.4800000000005
150% worth of photonic

7873.32 --> 7880.32
energy if that

7876.48 --> 7883.199
happens then I've literally disproven

7880.32 --> 7886.28
the photon

7883.199 --> 7891.759999999999
because that means that there

7886.28 --> 7894.84
is light based energy that can be

7891.76 --> 7898.360000000001
transmitted that simply is not enough to

7894.84 --> 7902.32
register but if you combine it then it

7898.36 --> 7906.159
will and that would mean that light is

7902.32 --> 7910.239
technically from that point on an

7906.159 --> 7912.119
infinitely divisible

7910.239 --> 7914.199
beam

7912.119 --> 7918.598999999999
infinitely divisible that means there is

7914.199 --> 7920.719
no minimum size to the amount of light

7918.599 --> 7924.119000000001
that can

7920.719 --> 7927.8
transpire Min no minimum the only

7924.119 --> 7931.96
minimum for it to be picked up is the

7927.8 --> 7934.400000000001
ability for matter to respond to its

7931.96 --> 7936.719
absorption in order for you to register

7934.4 --> 7939.079
it and that would change the very

7936.719 --> 7940.159
definition of the nature of light in all

7939.079 --> 7943.799999999999
of

7940.159 --> 7943.799999999999
physics it's one of my

7944.719 --> 7949.88
dreams looks like I got some

7946.599 --> 7951.88
experimenting to do I know but yeah I

7949.88 --> 7954.559
mean I don't exactly have access to

7951.88 --> 7957.2390000000005
Argan pump lasers and it's a very

7954.559 --> 7960.400000000001
serious thing I'd need a couple of

7957.239 --> 7964.0
people to basically sign

7960.4 --> 7969.679
on with me that are willing to like do

7964.0 --> 7971.88
this test witness it and like be very

7969.679 --> 7975.28
careful with it because

7971.88 --> 7978.76
I'm not a academic

7975.28 --> 7981.44
person you see I'm not an

7978.76 --> 7983.2390000000005
academic if a serious test like this

7981.44 --> 7986.0
should be done there should be Witnesses

7983.239 --> 7988.239
and experts on like how you establish

7986.0 --> 7990.76
these things and how you would report

7988.239 --> 7990.759999999999
out on

7991.599 --> 7996.4800000000005
it and how to operate an Argan pump

7994.32 --> 8002.759999999999
laser I don't know I don't even know

7996.48 --> 8003.678999999999
what they look like right but

8002.76 --> 8007.079000000001
the

8003.679 --> 8010.88
test is there I've conceived of it I

8007.079 --> 8010.88
conceived of it four years

8011.719 --> 8019.52
ago and hopefully one day it will be

8015.239 --> 8022.48
tested and hey here's the thing it's

8019.52 --> 8025.88
falsifiable and that means I could be

8022.48 --> 8028.959999999999
wrong I could be

8025.88 --> 8032.159000000001
wrong fire less than a photon worth of

8028.96 --> 8035.36
energy it simply might not be possible

8032.159 --> 8037.679
for the device to even do that I don't

8035.36 --> 8041.44
know I have no

8037.679 --> 8045.719
idea we might have to alter argon pump

8041.44 --> 8048.36
lasers to be able to do such a

8045.719 --> 8051.32
thing right maybe you can't even fire it

8048.36 --> 8055.079
up for less than a photon worth and then

8051.32 --> 8059.0
you have to like scoop or catch it like

8055.079 --> 8061.32
with mirror somehow make sure that not a

8059.0 --> 8063.199
full Photon even though there's a minut

8061.32 --> 8066.28
amount of photon of one Photon that

8063.199 --> 8069.879999999999
comes out that it's not that like half

8066.28 --> 8074.119
of it is absorbed or something right so

8069.88 --> 8077.76
that not a full full Photon comes out

8074.119 --> 8080.799999999999
that's because it is kind of

8077.76 --> 8085.280000000001
important for the entire

8080.8 --> 8088.76
test so yeah someone fund this man yeah

8085.28 --> 8090.5199999999995
donate to my PayPal so I can eat yeah in

8088.76 --> 8092.04
order for this experiment to come into

8090.52 --> 8095.8
being

8092.04 --> 8098.28
I need to be fed long enough to survive

8095.8 --> 8101.1990000000005
and eventually come to actually

8098.28 --> 8101.199
performing this

8104.0 --> 8109.119
experiment

8105.92 --> 8113.0
right but hey if some University Physics

8109.119 --> 8115.159
person bumps into this like into light

8113.0 --> 8118.32
not a wave nor particle and they're like

8115.159 --> 8122.239
whoa what the hell that's actually

8118.32 --> 8124.119
really interesting dude contact me email

8122.239 --> 8127.239
I'm very serious about

8124.119 --> 8129.239
this but I will also not have the credit

8127.239 --> 8133.919999999999
stolen from me you're not just going to

8129.239 --> 8133.919999999999
take the entire thing and then kick me

8134.32 --> 8142.799999999999
out right I will be registered in the

8140.119 --> 8143.719
official record as the person that came

8142.8 --> 8147.159000000001
up with

8143.719 --> 8149.679
it that's it that's all I really need I

8147.159 --> 8152.96
need to be registered as the person that

8149.679 --> 8157.28
came up with it because I did I came up

8152.96 --> 8161.159
with this nobody else came up with this

8157.28 --> 8164.0
nobody ever I came up with this I want

8161.159 --> 8166.199
to be known as the person that came up

8164.0 --> 8166.199
with

8177.599 --> 8182.119000000001
this see they holl out of mountain in

8180.28 --> 8186.04
Japan building the large nutrino

8182.119 --> 8186.04
detector fascinating theable

8189.199 --> 8195.24
D could be science

8192.439 --> 8197.0
fiction I mean what the hell's a nutrino

8195.24 --> 8198.559
even supposed to be like those are like

8197.0 --> 8201.84
micro

8198.559 --> 8206.84
particles that are basically derived

8201.84 --> 8209.439
from squiggly lines in like in a superh

8206.84 --> 8212.84
Hadron Collider so it is kind of like

8209.439 --> 8212.84
divination nonsense

8213.84 --> 8218.599
math I agree with Richard G there it is

8216.88 --> 8221.199999999999
science

8218.599 --> 8223.960000000001
fiction right so we don't need to deal

8221.2 --> 8227.84
with that what we need to deal with is

8223.96 --> 8230.559
light I mean you don't need to redefine

8227.84 --> 8234.12
micro particles or virtual [ __ ] or

8230.559 --> 8236.479
anything all you need to do is have that

8234.12 --> 8240.599
argon pump laser thing or an even more

8236.479 --> 8243.519
advanced version fire less than a photon

8240.599 --> 8246.8
worth of energy and then have two of

8243.519 --> 8250.519
those aimed at One Singular spot on a

8246.8 --> 8253.438999999998
photoelectric plate that is all you

8250.519 --> 8256.28
need that like that is all I mean the

8253.439 --> 8259.479000000001
entire setup that I just put down it's

8256.28 --> 8262.08
not that complicated like why the [ __ ]

8259.479 --> 8265.639
didn't they come up with that 80 years

8262.08 --> 8268.399
ago why didn't anybody think of that it

8265.639 --> 8270.279999999999
is so

8268.399 --> 8273.16
frustrating people could have figured

8270.28 --> 8276.960000000001
this out 80 years ago why didn't they

8273.16 --> 8276.96
why didn't they do that it's so

8281.78 --> 8284.959
[Applause]

8287.679 --> 8293.559
simple why didn't

8290.399 --> 8296.76
they why didn't they figure it out 80

8293.559 --> 8302.759999999998
years ago my test is not

8296.76 --> 8302.76
that complicated it's a simple test

8304.519 --> 8308.84
why didn't they

8319.96 --> 8323.96
try yeah sure debatable

8324.24 --> 8330.0
D really makes you wonder yes I know it

8327.96 --> 8331.399
it makes me not just wonder it makes me

8330.0 --> 8334.28
worried

8331.399 --> 8338.24
it just makes me worried like how many

8334.28 --> 8341.519
brilliant ideas have just been snuffed

8338.24 --> 8344.199999999999
out how many of these people that even

8341.519 --> 8346.28
we know and are respected and are

8344.2 --> 8348.84
registered in the books how many of them

8346.28 --> 8351.24
have basically be threatened with with

8348.84 --> 8353.92
murder and all that like this is as far

8351.24 --> 8356.319
as you go like this is the way you're

8353.92 --> 8359.439
going to roll it out now or you die or

8356.319 --> 8362.199999999999
something like why the [ __ ] aren't there

8359.439 --> 8364.639000000001
any actual Solutions

8362.2 --> 8368.800000000001
why didn't they all figure it out why

8364.639 --> 8371.319
are we still onto fundamental nature of

8368.8 --> 8373.8
things just dwelling on it and just

8371.319 --> 8377.359
wasting everybody's

8373.8 --> 8381.119999999999
time when the misconceptions are so

8377.359 --> 8384.639000000001
palpable and so

8381.12 --> 8384.639000000001
resolvable it's

8386.319 --> 8391.96
sickening it makes me think like

8389.72 --> 8395.0
supposed science departments and

8391.96 --> 8397.919999999998
University they're just a [ __ ]

8395.0 --> 8401.399
scam like the whole knowledge base is a

8397.92 --> 8403.6
giant [ __ ] scam just to leech money

8401.399 --> 8406.68
out of people with their fake

8403.6 --> 8409.960000000001
intellectual Pursuits it's a giant

8406.68 --> 8413.800000000001
[ __ ] scam all of it is a

8409.96 --> 8417.16
scam we're being presented with false

8413.8 --> 8419.84
knowledge that is resolvable that could

8417.16 --> 8421.16
have been resolved like [ __ ] 80 years

8419.84 --> 8424.72
ago

8421.16 --> 8427.2
and yet it is perpetuated endlessly the

8424.72 --> 8428.76
nonsense irresolvable nonsense every

8427.2 --> 8431.479000000001
time taking things in the wrong

8428.76 --> 8434.2
direction endlessly wrong endlessly

8431.479 --> 8435.519999999999
wrong oh we're so intellectual we're so

8434.2 --> 8438.04
[ __ ] intellectual we're still

8435.52 --> 8441.84
dwelling on the same nonsense everybody

8438.04 --> 8446.319000000001
did 80 years ago professionally getting

8441.84 --> 8449.76
high paid jobs to dwell on the same

8446.319 --> 8453.519999999999
nonsense your entire life and never

8449.76 --> 8456.52
figuring it out out it is

8453.52 --> 8456.52
mortifyingly

8459.439 --> 8463.0
embarrassing and

8476.52 --> 8488.800000000001
evil all right anyway There Goes My

8483.479 --> 8492.599999999999
rant and just it just pisses me off man

8488.8 --> 8494.96
like I don't get it like how didn't they

8492.6 --> 8499.76
do

8494.96 --> 8499.759999999998
this my idea is not that freaking

8507.84 --> 8513.52
complicated anyway donate to my PayPal

8510.8 --> 8515.72
or the patre become part of my patreon

8513.52 --> 8518.68
if you like what I do and you hope that

8515.72 --> 8524.76
maybe in the future I

8518.68 --> 8524.76
will actually amount to some real

8525.76 --> 8529.68
experimentation I would love to do

8539.52 --> 8542.52
that

8544.43 --> 8549.479000000001
[Music]

8547.56 --> 8551.519999999999
oh and by the way thank you again Mojo

8549.479 --> 8554.8
for the Illuminati croissant support

8551.52 --> 8557.04
thanks to Mojo I am capable of having

8554.8 --> 8560.88
regular Illuminati croissant during my

8557.04 --> 8564.439
show which I greatly

8560.88 --> 8564.438999999998
enjoy they're very

8569.439 --> 8572.439
nourishing

8574.359 --> 8580.6
flatter sages all microparticle nonsense

8577.72 --> 8586.24
derived from squiggly lines from the

8580.6 --> 8586.24
hron collider it's all nonsense all

8599.439 --> 8602.439
theoretics

8605.76 --> 8610.880000000001
I it's just the microw world mysticism

8609.399 --> 8614.76
that's what it

8610.88 --> 8617.679999999998
is it's as soon as you go beyond

8614.76 --> 8620.64
atomics you're dealing with mysticism

8617.68 --> 8624.2
because you can't actually grasp it it's

8620.64 --> 8628.16
all mathematically derived from squiggly

8624.2 --> 8631.359
lines and it's all unprovable it's just

8628.16 --> 8633.68
mathematicians just

8631.359 --> 8635.359
taking up a Turf like this is our

8633.68 --> 8638.6
Authority oh we're the only ones that

8635.359 --> 8641.92
can figure it out yeah yeah because it's

8638.6 --> 8645.04
literally non-existent and mysticism and

8641.92 --> 8645.04
you're just mathem

8645.08 --> 8650.8
magicians holding your ground within

8648.08 --> 8653.56
your region of mysticism because it can

8650.8 --> 8656.8
never actually be proven nor will there

8653.56 --> 8660.119999999999
ever be a real world application to any

8656.8 --> 8661.438999999998
of it right it's just there to colonize

8660.12 --> 8664.560000000001
your

8661.439 --> 8666.16
mind and and feel all special and and

8664.56 --> 8668.439
all

8666.16 --> 8671.24
futuristic yeah you got all their their

8668.439 --> 8673.479000000001
rocket people oh we're going to go to

8671.24 --> 8676.52
Mars we're going to go to the source oh

8673.479 --> 8679.399
oh just oh your grandchildren will live

8676.52 --> 8682.68
there yeah just like they told your

8679.399 --> 8685.278999999999
grandfather and their grandfather and

8682.68 --> 8687.2
Etc and then there's the mathem magician

8685.279 --> 8690.84
oh w we got all this micro particle oh

8687.2 --> 8692.68
we found the fundamental particle

8690.84 --> 8694.8
yeah yeah something that nobody could

8692.68 --> 8698.04
ever see that will never be applied that

8694.8 --> 8701.8
you can never use in the micro world

8698.04 --> 8701.800000000001
yeah it's the same hor

8702.64 --> 8708.56
[ __ ] just mathem

8705.359 --> 8712.76
magicians holding their ground within a

8708.56 --> 8712.76
region of mysticism that's what that

8713.8 --> 8716.8
is

8717.52 --> 8722.319000000001
Wizardry Wizardry of the illusion time

8723.81 --> 8727.449999999999
[Music]

8730.68 --> 8736.92
type yeah I mean oh we we're figuring

8733.76 --> 8741.08
out about neutrinos oh oh really how

8736.92 --> 8744.04
about cell reproduction HH oh yeah you

8741.08 --> 8746.16
got all those micro cell organel and the

8744.04 --> 8747.640000000001
protein this and the protein that oh

8746.16 --> 8750.68
really so where's the actual proof of

8747.64 --> 8752.399
that oh oh you don't have any you just

8750.68 --> 8755.08
call it a spark of life you see

8752.399 --> 8758.24
something but you can't figure it out

8755.08 --> 8762.8
yeah yeah oh but you can figure

8758.24 --> 8766.6
out infinitely smaller particles can you

8762.8 --> 8770.119999999999
that you can't actually see oh yes sure

8766.6 --> 8772.6
so you can't even figure out a cell

8770.12 --> 8776.800000000001
reproduction but you can figure out this

8772.6 --> 8779.24
micro micro micro particle right yeah

8776.8 --> 8781.56
sure you

8779.24 --> 8785.439
can

8781.56 --> 8789.399
yeah yeah men men can make a lot of

8785.439 --> 8791.720000000001
claims and claim a lot of powers powers

8789.399 --> 8793.64
of perception and

8791.72 --> 8796.8
knowledge

8793.64 --> 8799.119999999999
that they don't have and they can't have

8796.8 --> 8802.16
and they never will have but they can

8799.12 --> 8804.560000000001
definitely convince a lot of dumb people

8802.16 --> 8804.56
that they

8805.6 --> 8814.439
do yeah people can't claim godhood but

8810.6 --> 8816.2
they can convince others that they have

8814.439 --> 8819.439
attained

8816.2 --> 8821.399000000001
godhood because one thing we all know

8819.439 --> 8824.800000000001
and that is that there's always people

8821.399 --> 8826.599999999999
gullible enough to believe the dumbest

8824.8 --> 8831.0
of

8826.6 --> 8837.319
things to believe do never underestimate

8831.0 --> 8837.319
the the ability of people to believe the

8838.319 --> 8843.6
unbelievable that seems to be the thing

8840.92 --> 8845.56
that's driving everything forward it's

8843.6 --> 8849.319
the thing that gives Satan its power is

8845.56 --> 8849.319
that people are dumb enough to believe

8854.96 --> 8861.599999999999
it effect when it collides with a proton

8858.76 --> 8863.68
bro proton is a

8861.6 --> 8867.2
conceptual

8863.68 --> 8871.04
element that's subchemical

8867.2 --> 8874.04
sub atomics like subatomic I aren't even

8871.04 --> 8877.04
proved they're totally

8874.04 --> 8879.560000000001
theoretical they're mathematical

8877.04 --> 8882.359
conception of

8879.56 --> 8884.92
ratios you can't even prove it's a thing

8882.359 --> 8884.92
debatable

8886.68 --> 8893.24
D there's no tangible proof for it it's

8889.84 --> 8895.56
a conception it's a very well well

8893.24 --> 8897.8
balanced elequent conception I'll give

8895.56 --> 8900.84
you that like yeah mathematically works

8897.8 --> 8903.479
out great it's a very handy

8900.84 --> 8906.08
consideration there's no physical proof

8903.479 --> 8908.679999999998
whatsoever though and it's not even

8906.08 --> 8908.68
claimed to

8923.319 --> 8928.319
be no there's no proof for sub

8928.64 --> 8934.278999999999
atomics you hear me

8930.88 --> 8937.88
no proof for sub

8934.279 --> 8941.0
atomics technically a singular atom

8937.88 --> 8943.92
hasn't even been isolated and observed

8941.0 --> 8946.24
yeah in that sense there is not really

8943.92 --> 8949.359
any proof for

8946.24 --> 8952.0
atomics there's just chemical ratios

8949.359 --> 8954.56
that have been quite

8952.0 --> 8956.6
eloquent but you can't even isolate a

8954.56 --> 8962.039999999999
single atom you

8956.6 --> 8962.04
can't there's no evidence for it

8962.439 --> 8967.359
there claimed to be evidence for it

8964.84 --> 8970.279
though are the same mysticism based

8967.359 --> 8973.720000000001
mathem magicians that claim sub

8970.279 --> 8976.0
atomics and keep diving deeper yeah none

8973.72 --> 8978.869999999999
of them has have ever even isolated a

8976.0 --> 8982.149
single atom so it's all

8978.87 --> 8982.149000000001
[Music]

8984.92 --> 8989.04

8989.04 --> 8993.319000000001

Liars futurists mathematicians Mystics

8997.319 --> 9003.72
and Liars that's what it is that's

8999.6 --> 9005.56
what's perpetuating the supposed future

9003.72 --> 9009.319
of the modern

9005.56 --> 9009.319
world would make a great

9011.279 --> 9015.359
title I'm going to save that for

9018.96 --> 9021.96
tomorrow

9024.56 --> 9030.24
please donate to my PayPal I could

9026.88 --> 9033.16
really use the support I'm going to go

9030.24 --> 9035.479
to the grocery store and get some dinner

9033.16 --> 9037.64
and all that because I've almost run out

9035.479 --> 9037.64
of

9048.92 --> 9051.92
food

9068.08 --> 9074.2
yeah math magicians Mystics and future

9072.04 --> 9078.359
math magicians

9074.2 --> 9078.359
Mystics futurists and

Liars

9081.99 --> 9092.739
[Music]

9105.84 --> 9111.84
what it's not much but it's dishonest

9108.8 --> 9111.84
Works what

9112.88 --> 9121.319
do electrons exist well theoretically

9116.08 --> 9121.319
electricity exists and it does have a

9122.279 --> 9127.12
component again chemistry works and in

9126.16 --> 9132.0
that

9127.12 --> 9134.640000000001
sense yeah electrons are a part of the

9132.0 --> 9136.84
atomic functions and

9134.64 --> 9138.68
interactions does that mean a single

9136.84 --> 9140.64
electron

9138.68 --> 9145.16
exists well

9140.64 --> 9147.358999999999
conceptually and mathematically they do

9145.16 --> 9150.2
huh does that mean that they're an

9147.359 --> 9150.2
indivisible

9152.64 --> 9158.439
unit I don't think you could prove

9156.68 --> 9163.04
that it's

9158.439 --> 9166.439
all Atomic thinking trying to reduce

9163.04 --> 9170.6
everything that exists to a indivisible

9166.439 --> 9172.279
unit of a specific size

9170.6 --> 9175.0
and then if it becomes less than that

9172.279 --> 9178.319000000001
indivisible unit then it becomes

9175.0 --> 9180.399
something else that's the atomic model

9178.319 --> 9183.92
approach of

9180.399 --> 9183.92
reality it's a

9186.6 --> 9194.24
model

9189.479 --> 9194.24
again no actual tangible

9198.76 --> 9201.76
proof

9228.72 --> 9231.72
for

9240.279 --> 9244.2
large body of

9249.0 --> 9252.279
in that's

hilarious yeah I've heard baller say

9259.24 --> 9261.72
that

9264.24 --> 9267.619999999999
it's

[Music]

9274.319 --> 9278.199999999999

9278.2 --> 9283.399000000001
that's about quantum mechanics it's

9279.72 --> 9286.08
about the property of things of matter

9283.399 --> 9288.56
and energy on every scale that's really

9286.08 --> 9290.279
what you learn about it what you didn't

9288.56 --> 9294.6
learn from that

9290.279 --> 9296.640000000001
is what is a singular unit yeah yeah

9294.6 --> 9300.16
they they didn't need to because it's

9296.64 --> 9302.68
quantum mechanics and it works to every

9300.16 --> 9305.279
skill they're not

9302.68 --> 9307.84
concerned with

9305.279 --> 9310.560000000001
atomism in quantum

9307.84 --> 9314.76
mechanics yeah

9310.56 --> 9318.76
Dumbass Dumbass debatable D the

9314.76 --> 9323.08
dumbass yeah they're not concerned with

9318.76 --> 9325.84
atomic mod s in in quantum mechanics

9323.08 --> 9333.0
they're only concerned with what do

9325.84 --> 9335.960000000001
things do at every tangible conceivable

9333.0 --> 9340.319
scale they're not concerned with all it

9335.96 --> 9344.119999999999
has to abide by our idea of this unit

9340.319 --> 9345.319
yeah they don't give a [ __ ] they just

9344.12 --> 9348.0
test

9345.319 --> 9350.84
everything and the properties of what

9348.0 --> 9353.96
they do and then try to describe that

9350.84 --> 9356.68
those properties mathematically at every

9353.96 --> 9359.039999999999
scale conceivable that's what they did

9356.68 --> 9361.720000000001
with quantum mechanics they didn't give

9359.04 --> 9365.060000000001
a [ __ ] about your

9361.72 --> 9366.319
atomism yeah that's a

9365.06 --> 9369.16
[Music]

9366.319 --> 9371.16
fact so keep telling yourself that oh

9369.16 --> 9374.359
it's because of atomism that we have

9371.16 --> 9377.359
computers and oh yeah

9374.359 --> 9377.359
yeah

9378.56 --> 9381.84
[ __ ]

9380.2 --> 9384.12
I'm going to take a two-minute break be

9381.84 --> 9384.12
right

9408.52 --> 9411.52
back

9438.52 --> 9441.52
e

9468.439 --> 9471.439
for

9497.96 --> 9501.438999999998
and I'm back

9509.8 --> 9512.358999999999
what was

9513.359 --> 9521.359
that anybody pick up on what that person

9517.16 --> 9525.92
said there just time you

9521.359 --> 9525.92
out just so you can see what you say

9527.16 --> 9531.439
yeah oh

9541.0 --> 9545.68
yeah I know he's

9543.0 --> 9549.399
Moxy got to dip shits you don't have to

9545.68 --> 9552.24
keep hand hinting at it I know he is

9549.399 --> 9558.16
Moxy you [ __ ]

9552.24 --> 9561.039999999999
retards you got it I know he is

9558.16 --> 9564.16
Moxy you you don't have to do some

9561.04 --> 9567.6
stupid little hint game you [ __ ]

9620.88 --> 9624.278999999999
you here Pond

9624.96 --> 9631.56
law man can't believe you have an

9627.2 --> 9635.76
account for 14

9631.56 --> 9635.76
years that's quite

9639.25 --> 9644.88
[Music]

9641.24 --> 9648.24
long yes Steve Bronson that's exactly

9644.88 --> 9651.24
correct you summarize it just just

9648.24 --> 9651.24
perfectly

9678.24 --> 9681.24
e

9694.399 --> 9699.8
photons and not Adams where the hell are

9696.24 --> 9699.8
you getting that from bux

9706.68 --> 9711.24
Buster weren't you baned

9711.72 --> 9715.358999999999
are you just returning with a [ __ ]

9713.359 --> 9718.08
sock account

9715.359 --> 9720.640000000001
[ __ ] before I go there this is

9718.08 --> 9722.8
probably the coffee speaking let me just

9720.64 --> 9725.92
check let me just check if you're

9722.8 --> 9725.92
supposed to be here or

9726.319 --> 9730.0
not I don't think you

9730.49 --> 9737.499
[Music]

9738.16 --> 9742.439
were

9740.52 --> 9745.880000000001
yeah you

9742.439 --> 9748.800000000001
weren't yeah yeah you're not welcome

9745.88 --> 9748.8
here

9749.76 --> 9752.919
[Music]

9768.12 --> 9771.12
hi

9773.2 --> 9778.16
wouldn't you already know the answer to

9774.92 --> 9783.8
your question at the point when a pump

9778.16 --> 9783.8
output less than a photon of light

9791.2 --> 9798.2
no the point is is Will anything happen

9795.319 --> 9800.199999999999
Steve Ronson you could technically set

9798.2 --> 9801.279
the device to less than a photon worth

9800.2 --> 9804.640000000001
of

9801.279 --> 9807.68
energy but you don't know if then

9804.64 --> 9807.68
anything happens at

9808.24 --> 9812.96
all right but you'll know if you

9811.2 --> 9817.359
basically cross the

9812.96 --> 9820.8
streams and then maybe something will

9817.359 --> 9820.800000000001
happen that's the

9828.04 --> 9831.04
point

9858.04 --> 9861.04
for

9872.56 --> 9878.278999999999
right and hey dve Bronson like I'm not

9875.96 --> 9882.88
sure if it is even technically possible

9878.279 --> 9886.84
like that's why it's just a conceptual

9882.88 --> 9889.319
idea and it would need to be figured out

9886.84 --> 9892.68
like I don't know even how our G pump

9889.319 --> 9895.278999999999
lasers actually work I've just been told

9892.68 --> 9898.84
like yeah they can fire a single

9895.279 --> 9901.960000000001
Photon but can they fire less or could

9898.84 --> 9905.56
you fire like one and a half like how

9901.96 --> 9910.199999999999
does this work I don't know I don't know

9905.56 --> 9912.88
exactly how it works that's required to

9910.2 --> 9916.52
be figured

9912.88 --> 9919.64
out research more closely once I

9916.52 --> 9923.52
actually get the opportunity

9919.64 --> 9923.519999999999
once people actually start to take me

9925.479 --> 9932.24
serious you wouldn't be able to set it

9928.04 --> 9935.92
to Output less than a photon well then

9932.24 --> 9935.92
my question would be why

9944.2 --> 9947.92
not

9946.0 --> 9949.56
right why

9947.92 --> 9951.6
not

9949.56 --> 9955.96
and could you

9951.6 --> 9958.640000000001
catch if you can't then could you

9955.96 --> 9961.96
basically extract some of that photonic

9958.64 --> 9965.278999999999
energy on the way could you absorb it

9961.96 --> 9969.0
partially without absorbing the whole of

9965.279 --> 9972.720000000001
it right there's all these ways of

9969.0 --> 9976.8
approaching it all these

9972.72 --> 9976.8
ways suppress it

9977.92 --> 9980.92
right

9983.72 --> 9989.56
go read and find out how power pumps

9985.92 --> 9989.56
were yeah go ahead you go and do

9992.52 --> 9997.399000000001
that then we can talk about it and you

9994.96 --> 9999.479
can explain it to me because I can tell

9997.399 --> 10003.08
you one thing I ain't reading no

9999.479 --> 10008.08
technical manuals about that it's not my

10003.08 --> 10011.039999999999
job I'm the one figuring out things I'm

10008.08 --> 10015.439
not ATT technical guy I'm not an

10011.04 --> 10015.439
engineer I don't have the patience for

10017.359 --> 10023.56
it I'm just the one that figures out

10020.88 --> 10027.119999999999
ideas in between everything that nobody

10023.56 --> 10027.119999999999
else thought of that's what I

10037.399 --> 10045.16
do it's kind of asking like why isn't

10040.96 --> 10048.8
half an apple a full one no it isn't hey

10045.16 --> 10051.439
aren't two half an apples one

10048.8 --> 10053.119999999999
apple aren't they as good as as one

10051.439 --> 10057.0
apple when you take two halves of an

10053.12 --> 10058.800000000001
apple yeah that's that's the entire idea

10057.0 --> 10061.64
behind

10058.8 --> 10063.599999999999
it that's a university help oh yeah

10061.64 --> 10065.358999999999
universities just help some random

10063.6 --> 10067.84
person

10065.359 --> 10070.84
that

10067.84 --> 10070.84
no

10072.279 --> 10079.319000000001
unless a university person is actually

10075.479 --> 10083.039999999999
going to approach me despite me uh being

10079.319 --> 10084.479
a flat earther and all that because I

10083.04 --> 10088.0
will

10084.479 --> 10091.76
never try to hide I'm a [ __ ] flat

10088.0 --> 10095.56
earther just to oh so I could get my way

10091.76 --> 10096.76
through oh yeah go [ __ ] yourself yeah

10095.56 --> 10099.6
that is what is

10096.76 --> 10102.279
required then I'll just keep all of this

10099.6 --> 10107.92
to myself forever and you can like

10102.279 --> 10107.92
squalor in your lies and ignorance then

10108.6 --> 10115.800000000001
forever you accept me as I am I will not

10112.0 --> 10118.92
suppress anything that I

10115.8 --> 10122.56
say yeah you're going to have to deal

10118.92 --> 10125.04
with that a flat earther figured out

that [ __ ] that universities around the

you're going to have that red registered

because they didn't do the narrative

10197.52 --> 10203.0
they're not part of the narrative well

you're [ __ ]

it's okay don't worry about

10337.52 --> 10343.6
it

10340.2 --> 10346.399000000001
yeah my my idea of light being

10343.6 --> 10350.359
infinitely

10346.399 --> 10354.319
divisible is a very old idea that I

10350.359 --> 10357.0
figured out when I was still in

10354.319 --> 10361.08
school I laid it

10357.0 --> 10364.72
down they said it was revolutionary

10361.08 --> 10368.8
potentially and then I got black Bal

10364.72 --> 10370.72
even back then so I've had quite the

10368.8 --> 10373.278999999999
level of

10370.72 --> 10375.72
frustration with this obviously

10373.279 --> 10378.399000000001
gatekeeping education system that we're

10375.72 --> 10382.16
all stuck in for like 80 years in the

10378.399 --> 10382.16
west I'm very

10382.76 --> 10388.92
frustrated very frustrated about

10386.04 --> 10392.160000000002
it and really at this point I wouldn't

10388.92 --> 10395.2
mind if it all just completely burned

10392.16 --> 10398.8
down cuz it is so heavily gate capped

10395.2 --> 10403.479000000001
that there's no progression whatsoever

10398.8 --> 10406.039999999999
in freaking 80 years it is

10403.479 --> 10408.399
evil it is

10406.04 --> 10411.52
unbelievably

10408.399 --> 10415.88
evil knowledge is being gate capped in

10411.52 --> 10418.880000000001
favor of stupid time wasting

10415.88 --> 10418.88
futuristic

the fake futurist West I'm sick of it it

10427.88 --> 10432.399
needs to

10428.96 --> 10436.039999999999
end end the fake

pretentious futurist nonsense knowledge

10436.04 --> 10440.359
end

10437.04 --> 10443.279
it progress when are we finally going to

10440.359 --> 10446.640000000001
move Beyond

10443.279 --> 10451.6
9040 yeah when are we finally going to

all right anyway if you

10478.64 --> 10484.0
sympathize then please uh consider

10482.08 --> 10486.52
helping me out

10484.0 --> 10490.319
financially I'm not the the Pinnacle of

10486.52 --> 10490.319000000001

10502.279 --> 10508.2
patreon I mean I do an everyday show I'm

10506.399 --> 10510.72
at show

10508.2 --> 10513.960000000001
1897 right

10510.72 --> 10515.76
now consider that consider I'm always a

10513.96 --> 10518.119999999999
person you can come back to unless

10515.76 --> 10519.84
you're a [ __ ] and I just ban you oh

10518.12 --> 10522.279
then you can still watch

10519.84 --> 10524.64
it I can't stop you from watching my

10522.279 --> 10526.880000000001
show it's a an open live show it's not

10524.64 --> 10529.76
private it's not members

10526.88 --> 10531.278999999999
only but you can always come back

10529.76 --> 10532.960000000001
because I'm here and I'm going to be

10531.279 --> 10534.68
talking about things and I'm going to be

10532.96 --> 10535.88
talking about these things I'm going to

10534.68 --> 10540.960000000001
talk

10535.88 --> 10540.96
about video products I'm going to talk

10542.64 --> 10547.599999999999
about series I'm going to talk about

10545.399 --> 10549.8
psychology I'm going to talk about

10547.6 --> 10553.640000000001
fantastic ideas I'm going to be talking

10549.8 --> 10556.438999999998
about spiritual things as I

10553.64 --> 10559.72
do and it will just keep coming back I

10556.439 --> 10562.92
will talk about my unique cosmogeny

10559.72 --> 10565.278999999999
ideas of how I think the realm is which

10562.92 --> 10567.76
is a little bit more surreal than the

10565.279 --> 10572.800000000001
average flat earther will say it

10567.76 --> 10574.960000000001
is yeah and it is a work in progress and

10572.8 --> 10578.519999999999
it's very tough I have to keep

10574.96 --> 10580.319
re-explaining it over and over again for

10578.52 --> 10582.479000000001
probably the next 10 years to come I

10580.319 --> 10584.88
have done it for like eight years and

10582.479 --> 10587.358999999999
there's still people that are just like

10584.88 --> 10589.56
I don't know I don't really get it yeah

10587.359 --> 10591.68
I get it it's really freaking tough it's

10589.56 --> 10595.08
really complicated it makes everything

10591.68 --> 10598.68
very very surreal because

10595.08 --> 10598.68
reality is

10598.8 --> 10606.759999999998
surreal it's real but the reality of

10603.319 --> 10609.8
reality is surreal it's not something

10606.76 --> 10612.12
that the mind can really easily grasp

10609.8 --> 10615.399
because reality is not just as

10612.12 --> 10618.76
straightforward and easily provable and

10615.399 --> 10621.64
easily figure out as people like to

10618.76 --> 10623.72
believe yeah there's a certain degree of

10621.64 --> 10627.358999999999
things that you can very simply figure

10623.72 --> 10629.0
out and then when you reach Beyond it it

10627.359 --> 10634.439
becomes

10629.0 --> 10637.6
surreal it just does I've accepted that

10634.439 --> 10639.76
and I've tried to move Beyond those

10637.6 --> 10643.720000000001
typical orders where most people just

10639.76 --> 10646.76
get a headache and leave and figure out

10643.72 --> 10649.039999999999
things through conceptions that reach

10646.76 --> 10650.800000000001
outside of the conventional form of

10649.04 --> 10652.800000000001
thinking that's how I came to the

10650.8 --> 10655.88
looping realm conception that's how I

10652.8 --> 10659.56
came to the non-local angular

10655.88 --> 10662.199999999999
manifestation of the celestial lights

10659.56 --> 10666.479
conception and that's how I came to the

10662.2 --> 10672.359
conception of nons space

10666.479 --> 10675.64
inability like non volume and lo local

10672.359 --> 10677.960000000001
locality of inability for matter to

10675.64 --> 10680.358999999999
exist in yeah these are conceptions that

10677.96 --> 10684.72
I came up with they're all surreal and

10680.359 --> 10687.399000000001
they may all be part of physical

10684.72 --> 10690.08
reality it's all up for

10687.399 --> 10692.399
Discovery and I will keep repeating

10690.08 --> 10695.88
those conceptions and keep rolling them

10692.399 --> 10698.199999999999
out for people to consider and at the

10695.88 --> 10702.519999999999
same time figure out the the very

10698.2 --> 10704.92
fundamental nature of physics like what

10702.52 --> 10706.800000000001
is light and they will keep continuing

10704.92 --> 10709.56
that exploration they will keep asking

10706.8 --> 10711.92
the questions and postulating my ideas

10709.56 --> 10712.68
until at some point they can be proven

10711.92 --> 10715.72
or

10712.68 --> 10719.2
disproven because falsifiability is a

10715.72 --> 10722.92
Cornerstone that I always seek out with

10719.2 --> 10725.439
any any idea if an idea is not

10722.92 --> 10727.56
falsifiable then it should be discarded

10725.439 --> 10729.64
because then it will become mysticism

10727.56 --> 10732.439
and con never be proven and you'll start

10729.64 --> 10734.64
dwelling on it like an aberration with

10732.439 --> 10737.479000000001
no end

10734.64 --> 10743.16
result if something cannot be proven or

10737.479 --> 10746.358999999999
disproven I discard it and so all my

10743.16 --> 10748.399
ideas are there either to just give you

10746.359 --> 10751.279
some kind of

10748.399 --> 10755.76
conception or if it's about physical

10751.279 --> 10759.439
reality and it's nature it must be

10755.76 --> 10762.0
falsifiable yeah even the looping aspect

10759.439 --> 10765.04
of the realm

10762.0 --> 10767.72
is conceived in a way that it is

10765.04 --> 10770.399000000001
falsifiable you can prove whether it is

10767.72 --> 10774.399
the case inevitably or whether it is not

10770.399 --> 10776.8
the case it's very important to me I

10774.399 --> 10779.76
know that that is because if I don't do

10776.8 --> 10782.8
that if I don't direct my my ideas

10779.76 --> 10785.68
towards such a point of falsifiability I

10782.8 --> 10789.16
will just be another weird hippie dippy

10785.68 --> 10791.439
Mystic online that you tune in until you

10789.16 --> 10794.0
like get tired and then you just lose

10791.439 --> 10796.52
track and I don't want people to grow

10794.0 --> 10798.56
mentally tired and lose track I want to

10796.52 --> 10802.640000000001
give them solid

10798.56 --> 10804.84
ideas that will actually be viable onto

10802.64 --> 10804.84
the

10810.12 --> 10815.960000000001
future

10813.04 --> 10817.800000000001
yeah when it will be proved whenever it

10815.96 --> 10819.039999999999
will be proved I don't give a [ __ ] it's

10817.8 --> 10821.92
not my

10819.04 --> 10825.560000000001
problem it's not my problem it's not my

10821.92 --> 10828.8
burden even to prove all that is my

10825.56 --> 10832.76
burden is that I explain things and I

10828.8 --> 10836.0
roll forward conceptions that can be

10832.76 --> 10836.0
proved or

10836.279 --> 10842.279
disproved that is what I do that is how

10839.56 --> 10844.16
I am a theorist I don't give you

10842.279 --> 10846.76
theories that can never be proven or

10844.16 --> 10849.56
disproven I only give you theories that

10846.76 --> 10852.279
can be proved or disproved now if

10849.56 --> 10854.08
somebody is going to make the physical

10852.279 --> 10857.04
attempt to prove or disprove it that

10854.08 --> 10863.64
would be fascinating that would be great

10857.04 --> 10867.399000000001
I'd love it it's not my burden though

10863.64 --> 10870.72
I'm just here to find the ideas I am

10867.399 --> 10874.119999999999
here to find the way through where no

10870.72 --> 10879.56
one else looks that's what I

10874.12 --> 10883.439
do that's my task it's not my my task to

10879.56 --> 10883.439
physically prove any of

10884.76 --> 10890.92
it would I not be pleased to be proved

10887.279 --> 10892.560000000001
correct yeah I would be greatly

10890.92 --> 10895.68
pleased

10892.56 --> 10899.319
but I wouldn't care if I

10895.68 --> 10901.04
wasn't and I would be equally pleased if

10899.319 --> 10903.88
I was proven

10901.04 --> 10906.399000000001
incorrect because at least somebody took

10903.88 --> 10910.679999999998
the effort to really figure it out then

10906.399 --> 10914.08
to figure out if my IDE was correct yeah

10910.68 --> 10915.880000000001
my ideas are falsifiable and that means

10914.08 --> 10921.16
they could also be

10915.88 --> 10924.599999999999
disproven when figured out when test it

10921.16 --> 10927.039999999999
properly cuz anybody could say oh I did

10924.6 --> 10929.960000000001
the test that Arwin said look oh it's

10927.04 --> 10932.560000000001
wrong Well yeah if you did it

10929.96 --> 10933.919999999998
wrong then you could probably claim that

10932.56 --> 10937.96
it was

10933.92 --> 10939.88
wrong but if you did it right and then

10937.96 --> 10943.119999999999
it turns out I was wrong well then I'll

10939.88 --> 10947.278999999999
admit like damn what a disappointment

10943.12 --> 10950.800000000001
what a bummer I was wrong after all oh

10947.279 --> 10954.2
well at least we figured it out

10950.8 --> 10956.56
right at least we're now Beyond where we

10954.2 --> 10958.359
were when we had no conception of these

10956.56 --> 10962.84
things at

10958.359 --> 10966.52
all I'm here for real progress and real

10962.84 --> 10969.84
progress starts with real ideas and real

10966.52 --> 10969.84
ideas are falsified

10972.52 --> 10978.129
iable so that's what I

10974.92 --> 10978.129
[Music]

10981.479 --> 10985.96
do typed in Natural Science and

10983.8 --> 10989.438999999998
scientific method and fed video showed

10985.96 --> 10989.438999999998
up well that's

10990.56 --> 10995.76
good that's cool also it's not that

10993.72 --> 10997.96
strange considering that you have been

10995.76 --> 11000.76
hanging around those circles so the

10997.96 --> 11003.679999999998
algorithm will be way more inclined to

11000.76 --> 11004.800000000001
promote those videos to you because

11003.68 --> 11009.08
you've

11004.8 --> 11011.119999999999
already are familiar with those videos a

11009.08 --> 11013.479
complete newcomer that's never heard of

11011.12 --> 11015.160000000002
Flat Earth or Flat Earth debates will

11013.479 --> 11018.16
not have the same results you got to

11015.16 --> 11018.16
keep that in mind Richard

11018.319 --> 11026.16
G that every algorithmic result is

11022.08 --> 11029.88
uniquely tinkered to the person

11026.16 --> 11032.52
always and based on their

11029.88 --> 11035.08
familiarities that's just how it

11032.52 --> 11037.76
works

11035.08 --> 11039.16
anyway I love to come up with an idea

11037.76 --> 11042.72
that changed the

11039.16 --> 11042.72
world I bet you

11043.68 --> 11049.64
do I

11046.0 --> 11051.52
do it's all I ever wanted it's all I

11049.64 --> 11055.358999999999
ever wanted since I figured out that

11051.52 --> 11057.359
this world is just it sucks

11055.359 --> 11059.439
mercilessly it's like oh but you can't

11057.359 --> 11063.04
change it anything about it well then I

11059.439 --> 11066.880000000001
will figure out ideas that will change

11063.04 --> 11070.080000000002
it and I won't even I literally wouldn't

11066.88 --> 11072.759999999998
have to lift a finger for it I'll just

11070.08 --> 11076.039999999999
create the idea and then as soon as you

11072.76 --> 11077.6
realize the idea is out there it's too

11076.04 --> 11082.080000000002
late to stop

11077.6 --> 11086.640000000001
it and guess what it's too late to stop

11082.08 --> 11091.319
it you can't stop me if you strike me

11086.64 --> 11094.16
down if you end me all it'll do is

11091.319 --> 11097.08
reinforce all those ideas that have been

11094.16 --> 11099.8
relatively Anonymous relatively Niche

11097.08 --> 11101.52
out there it will all amplify it and

11099.8 --> 11105.119999999999
then really

11101.52 --> 11107.560000000001
irrevocably change the world and deulti

11105.12 --> 11110.960000000001
it de gatekeep

11107.56 --> 11113.319
it yeah and this why you kind of leave

11110.96 --> 11115.96
me alone that's why the big players

11113.319 --> 11118.239
leave me alone this is why my channel

11115.96 --> 11120.319
stays small

11118.239 --> 11123.199999999999
but not completely blocked it's why they

11120.319 --> 11125.399
don't choke me out just keep me small

11123.2 --> 11130.439
it's the best strategy it's the best

11125.399 --> 11135.319
strategy for their survival you see and

11130.439 --> 11135.319
I'm good with that because it doesn't

11135.56 --> 11142.16
matter

11137.279 --> 11146.16
yeah the stones already in the pond the

11142.16 --> 11149.64
Ripple is already in the way you can't

11146.16 --> 11149.64
stop me anymore

11150.2 --> 11155.52
the effect I have caused I've already

11155.84 --> 11161.960000000001
caused all of this is just bonus this is

11158.64 --> 11161.96
just me living my

11162.319 --> 11170.199999999999
life as a consolidation price the

11166.319 --> 11172.76
influence that I've had I've already had

11170.2 --> 11176.52
it's already too late the knowledge and

11172.76 --> 11179.56
the ideas that will change the world are

11176.52 --> 11179.560000000001
already out there

11179.64 --> 11187.358999999999
it's too late it's over for them my

11184.0 --> 11189.8
revenge is already complete I know it

11187.359 --> 11193.52
is and I don't even have to do anything

11189.8 --> 11197.8
anymore all I have to do is just keep

11193.52 --> 11200.439
reenacting everything that's that I

11197.8 --> 11204.358999999999
wanted and that's what I'm

11200.439 --> 11205.92
doing re bring up the ideas we make make

11204.359 --> 11208.239
people get used to it and then when the

11205.92 --> 11212.319
time comes and the old or and it's

11208.239 --> 11214.119999999999
gatekeeping hor [ __ ] all crumbles in

11212.319 --> 11218.08
humiliation and

11214.12 --> 11223.68
hell then my ideas will take their

11218.08 --> 11223.68
rightful place in the human

11225.8 --> 11229.92
knowledge that's really all I ever

11233.12 --> 11238.2
wanted and then it all

11235.68 --> 11239.76
begins I mean what do you think that oh

11238.2 --> 11242.6
once you figure this out that it's the

11239.76 --> 11246.16
end no it's the

11242.6 --> 11249.960000000001
beginning you see once the

11246.16 --> 11253.84
gates are opened and the gatekeeping

11249.96 --> 11256.8
stops then the actual fractal

11253.84 --> 11261.359
inwards of the pure knowledge that's the

11256.8 --> 11264.519999999999
start and then the real deep

11261.359 --> 11266.439
wonders of understanding really will

11264.52 --> 11269.800000000001
start to Bubble

11266.439 --> 11272.08
Up and they'll scare me probably when

11269.8 --> 11274.0
that happens it's just that I'm so sick

11272.08 --> 11277.399
of this gapek keeped

11274.0 --> 11280.72
reality that I'm like I've just focused

11277.399 --> 11283.72
so much on like trying to destroy that

11280.72 --> 11288.278999999999
but once the the continuation after that

11283.72 --> 11291.239
point I'll probably like not even be all

11288.279 --> 11293.84
that interested in ways is a lot of it

11291.239 --> 11295.76
might bypass me it'll be like yeah but

11293.84 --> 11299.68
that wasn't why I'm here I was here to

11295.76 --> 11302.6
break the gatekeeping that's why I exist

11299.68 --> 11303.800000000001
to break the gate I was here to break

11302.6 --> 11306.720000000001
the

11303.8 --> 11309.519999999999
gate and where it goes from that point

11306.72 --> 11312.56
on it's like yeah that's not really my

11309.52 --> 11312.560000000001
business even in a

11321.96 --> 11329.119999999999
way to shake the [ __ ] up

11326.2 --> 11332.04
right yeah that and I figured that out

11329.12 --> 11333.84
very young figured out very young like

11332.04 --> 11336.439
oh wow all these possibility all these

11333.84 --> 11338.399
things I'm seeing and then every time I

11336.439 --> 11342.2
came up with something it started very

11338.399 --> 11345.278999999999
young like pre-teen young every time

11342.2 --> 11351.239000000001
figured something out it was like

11345.279 --> 11351.239
yeah gate kept like yeah we don't do

11351.68 --> 11358.359
that every time my entire

11355.64 --> 11360.68
youth it made me

11358.359 --> 11360.68
very

11361.68 --> 11366.960000000001
depressed that because every time I had

11364.319 --> 11369.519999999999
a moment of bright Glory they will

11366.96 --> 11372.16
always sniff it out again always every

11369.52 --> 11376.399000000001
[ __ ] time it happened they sniff it

11372.16 --> 11379.479
out and made me just feel like I'm in a

11376.399 --> 11384.08
in a caged world where

11379.479 --> 11386.358999999999
ignorance Reigns Supreme and real

11384.08 --> 11389.2
spiritual intellectual freedom is

11386.359 --> 11393.08
attacked

11389.2 --> 11395.76
and I hated it I hated it deeply and

11393.08 --> 11398.399
I've dedicated my entire life to break

11395.76 --> 11402.0
that gate to break that

11398.399 --> 11402.0
cage and that's what I'm

11403.319 --> 11408.359
doing

11405.52 --> 11411.6
anyway right so anyway I'm rounding out

11408.359 --> 11414.04
the show it's over three hours already

11411.6 --> 11414.04
it's been

11414.12 --> 11421.399000000001
interesting very esoteric in ways

run out the

11463.16 --> 11468.72

11466.56 --> 11470.319
been a dynamic show I've been a bit

11468.72 --> 11473.88
Rowdy I've been a

11470.319 --> 11475.72
bit got a little bit of a rage wi back

11473.88 --> 11477.56
but a little bit I'm not I'm very

11475.72 --> 11480.119999999999
specifically trying to not take it too

11477.56 --> 11482.92
far because I've gone over the top with

11480.12 --> 11484.84
it which has caused some damage

11482.92 --> 11487.399
reputational and

11484.84 --> 11490.359
otherwise and

11487.399 --> 11495.278999999999
I'm in my reformed

11490.359 --> 11496.68
self I aim to basically never surpass

11495.279 --> 11500.2
those lines

11496.68 --> 11503.479000000001
again but I I will be Rowdy and I will

11500.2 --> 11505.479000000001
be shouty a little bit here and there I

11503.479 --> 11507.84
will call some people [ __ ] and

11505.479 --> 11509.88
retards and all that

11507.84 --> 11512.2
and sometimes I might even say that when

11509.88 --> 11514.8
somebody doesn't actually really deserve

11512.2 --> 11517.640000000001
it because they were just openly asking

11514.8 --> 11520.679999999998
a questions but in in a time where I

11517.64 --> 11523.56
read it like it they might have been a

11520.68 --> 11525.84
troll but yeah that sort of thing

11523.56 --> 11529.84
happens sometimes I'm a little

11525.84 --> 11532.319
hotheaded and I hope you

11529.84 --> 11535.439
beg yeah what did you

11532.319 --> 11539.0

11539.0 --> 11545.64
