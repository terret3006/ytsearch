61.29 --> 70.47
that would be much appreciated so today

67.2 --> 76.05
is yeah like yesterday though it's kind

70.47 --> 78.42
of fresh rainy a little bit well yeah

76.05 --> 80.91
yes they it clouded up pretty badly in

78.42 --> 86.19
the evening and well it's been like that

80.91 --> 91.619
I haven't caught any direct rain though

86.19 --> 98.39
yet but yeah today today I got with me

91.619 --> 104.33
Tamara coffee tea and a tangerine yay

98.39 --> 108.119
another type round ones and I hadn't I

104.33 --> 110.4
had an Illuminati cousin but I already

108.119 --> 113.49
ate it because that was kind of my

110.4 --> 121.56
breakfast so yesterday was extremely

113.49 --> 126.24
late like went on a call with Rasta

121.56 --> 129.92000000000002
after 12:00 and yeah when I do that

126.24 --> 129.92
things turn out very late

130.069 --> 138.26899999999998
but it was good fun though yeah also

134.45 --> 141.23899999999998
wasn't a coal with the globe light tour

138.269 --> 146.34
and they kind of dropped a pretty big

141.239 --> 151.439
proposal on me so let's see was in chat

146.34 --> 157.159
first before I get into that so ATM was

151.439 --> 165.989
first an Amanda young stone monkey 3d

157.159 --> 173.159
giulio Pavan / moco and Brent M ranty

165.989 --> 180.29
right if letters hairy Zack hunt crazy

173.159 --> 180.29
cutie dark man yeah

187.959 --> 196.84
I got a little bit of a headache but

194.77 --> 200.34900000000002
that's because I'm already pretty much

196.84 --> 202.87
getting excited for the the Amsterdam

200.349 --> 205.39
conference but now it's potentially been

202.87 --> 207.64000000000001
made very complex at a short run and I

205.39 --> 211.77999999999997
already kind of feel where it's going

207.64 --> 215.73899999999998
but okay so here's the situation

211.78 --> 219.25
I was basically offered a driver seat in

215.739 --> 221.35
the globe light - or it it seems like

219.25 --> 223.81
they were kind of expecting me to do

221.35 --> 227.89
that because they kept a special spot up

223.81 --> 229.72
it was very demonstrative so I was kind

227.89 --> 234.819
of put on the spot there especially

229.72 --> 237.4
because it's such crazy short run but

234.819 --> 240.13
they wanted me to be a driver and that

237.4 --> 243.42000000000002
would potentially be up to Warsaw in

240.13 --> 246.549
Poland I've never even been there and

243.42 --> 248.5
well driving through Germany I've done

246.549 --> 257.41
that before so I kind of already know

248.5 --> 260.44
what it's like from experience all the

257.41 --> 265.51000000000005
here's the the bigger issue what do i do

260.44 --> 269.169
at the way back because yeah going on

265.51 --> 272.8
the train from Poland back to Utrecht is

269.169 --> 274.33
literally 16 hours and that means I

272.8 --> 278.26
would potentially have to sleep on that

274.33 --> 283.39
train and that is not necessarily that

278.26 --> 285.669
secure so I kind of don't want to risk

283.39 --> 291.039
that especially if I'm gonna be bringing

285.669 --> 294.25
a lot of stuff with me you know so the

291.039 --> 297.55
alternative would be to go by plane but

294.25 --> 299.56
yeah that costs money it would be very

297.55 --> 302.08
quick though I could be back within the

299.56 --> 305.44
day and that's just a hell of a lot more

302.08 --> 308.46
convenient especially ever after after

305.44 --> 316.0
having traveled on the road for a week

308.46 --> 318.849
so the only issue now is the money for

316.0 --> 319.71
that so yeah that is where the problem

318.849 --> 325.3
really comes

319.71 --> 330.25
you know like I think I'd probably need

325.3 --> 330.79
like to just get 200 euros out of

330.25 --> 333.3
nothing

330.79 --> 336.52000000000004
roughly and that's just an estimate and

333.3 --> 339.40000000000003
I'd have to get it within two days right

336.52 --> 344.62
or I have some kind of guarantee that

339.4 --> 346.21
it'll be there afterward but that

344.62 --> 348.37
doesn't mean super chat so I'm

346.21 --> 351.28
definitely not asking for super chats

348.37 --> 360.46
here because yeah that's not really

351.28 --> 364.98999999999995
gonna help so yeah by this I guess I'm

360.46 --> 366.96999999999997
asking everyone can you do you think do

364.99 --> 370.71000000000004
you wanna see our win on the road as

366.97 --> 377.44000000000005
part of the globe light tour and just

370.71 --> 378.64
yeah do you wanna see that if you do

377.44 --> 382.12
then

378.64 --> 387.15
yeah if you can help me get a say

382.12 --> 390.58
through 200 euros through my PayPal then

387.15 --> 393.54999999999995
yeah within a short time then I can do

390.58 --> 398.10999999999996
it I can literally just get the right

393.55 --> 400.21000000000004
ticket and buy in some food for organic

398.11 --> 402.28000000000003
food for a week and I'll be going I'll

400.21 --> 405.19
be going to the conference and then from

402.28 --> 407.10999999999996
the conference straight on with the

405.19 --> 410.41
globe light tour so what do you guys

407.11 --> 411.79
think it's it's pretty heavy but I think

410.41 --> 416.01000000000005
that if I don't have to worry

411.79 --> 416.01000000000005
financially I can definitely pull it off

416.16 --> 424.81
okay to me this is a wild wild adventure

420.63 --> 427.6
because basically Evan left my home in a

424.81 --> 429.22
long time so yeah it's up to you I'm

427.6 --> 437.34000000000003
gonna leave it up to my audience up to

429.22 --> 440.08000000000004
my fans spread the word if you can and

437.34 --> 444.27
yeah I'd love to but it's not gonna be

440.08 --> 448.33
great for me if I'm gonna be like after

444.27 --> 450.58
three weeks from now suddenly bang yeah

448.33 --> 452.5
you totally ran out of money my dad

450.58 --> 455.71
can't help me with that

452.5 --> 458.41
I've already got that with people yeah

455.71 --> 461.38
that's gonna be screwed so I can only

458.41 --> 463.63000000000005
really afford it if I can literally

461.38 --> 465.39
afford it so the money is the issue in

463.63 --> 468.01
this case

465.39 --> 470.86
think of it whatever you will and it's

468.01 --> 472.39
very simple if I don't get it then I'm

470.86 --> 474.43
just not gonna do I'm just gonna go to

472.39 --> 478.45
the conference but it's yeah it's major

474.43 --> 480.91
bummer and probably also to the globe

478.45 --> 484.83
like tour guides because I really felt

480.91 --> 484.83000000000004
they were kind of counting on me

485.97 --> 493.53000000000003
Wow Thank You Brandon I really

489.64 --> 496.15
appreciate that it's a start

493.53 --> 498.30999999999995
yeah some fresh air would definitely be

496.15 --> 501.57
good although look I got an entire roof

498.31 --> 507.96
to myself plenty of trees around but

501.57 --> 510.15999999999997
just I don't know be on the road with

507.96 --> 515.0799999999999
with Roxanna I think that would be

510.16 --> 522.12
really interesting I don't know who else

515.08 --> 522.12
is gonna be there all right

522.84 --> 526.279
Wow okay

530.79 --> 539.9699999999999
I anyway that that is my preliminary

536.84 --> 544.08
estimate I'm gonna have to figure out

539.97 --> 547.23
just how to properly buy a plane ticket

544.08 --> 549.6
from there to the net I've never even

547.23 --> 552.48
done that it's not it's absolutely not

549.6 --> 555.72
as straightforward as anything I know in

552.48 --> 558.39
the Netherlands so might need some tips

555.72 --> 561.39
there as well because I've already from

558.39 --> 568.83
hearing about it in the past that the

561.39 --> 573.56
prices can vary wildly and all that yes

568.83 --> 573.5600000000001
yes I am Adam hello by the way

580.37 --> 590.889
you can get it off the website the

583.819 --> 590.889
airport you're traveling to or from

594.13 --> 596.85
yes

600.04 --> 606.88
yeah and isn't it funny that I just so

602.839 --> 606.8800000000001
happened to have my passport anyway

613.98 --> 622.32
hmm all right yeah Darth man well my

619.74 --> 628.29
budget is basically only gonna be my own

622.32 --> 630.84
food I can handle that also I'll

628.29 --> 632.64
probably be saving cost from not smoking

630.84 --> 634.32
as much cannabis since we're yeah we're

632.64 --> 636.93
going to the country where you're not

634.32 --> 638.6700000000001
allowed to do that I don't know what the

636.93 --> 640.62
rest is gonna do but I'm not got as a

638.67 --> 641.04
driver especially I'm just not gonna do

640.62 --> 645.09
that

641.04 --> 649.23
don't want to risk that [ __ ] I know it's

645.09 --> 651.74
a good excuse not to I don't really need

649.23 --> 651.74
it anyway

655.37 --> 663.21
not at a constant basis so but yeah the

659.76 --> 665.76
main fix financially is the trip back

663.21 --> 667.8000000000001
which I want to do by plane because I

665.76 --> 671.9399999999999
don't want to sit through a 16-hour

667.8 --> 677.3399999999999
train trip after a week on the road

671.94 --> 679.62
travel yeah piss off darks are you're

677.34 --> 685.49
gonna get a timeout for that that's just

679.62 --> 685.49
the horrific thing pays off please

687.11 --> 694.519
[Music]

698.51 --> 703.91
[Music]

701.32 --> 709.49
right how much is a plane ticket home

703.91 --> 712.31
well I don't know for sure but it

709.49 --> 716.03
I am sizing it up has to be somewhere

712.31 --> 721.0699999999999
between 100 and 200 euros I have I

716.03 --> 723.35
really I tried to figure it out didn't

721.07 --> 731.5400000000001
really succeed yesterday through Google

723.35 --> 736.03
searches 45 euros you say ready from

731.54 --> 736.03
Poland to Amsterdam really

743.35 --> 749.53
alright yeah what that is also the thing

746.17 --> 754.12
you know when when you're going and we

749.53 --> 755.5
out out there away from home unexpected

754.12 --> 759.84
things can happen also

755.5 --> 759.84
so that's I'd I just want to buffer

761.34 --> 769.1800000000001
anyway I'll be checking up on my paypal

764.98 --> 770.95
right now cuz yeah people already saying

769.18 --> 778.78
they've done it it so that's that's

770.95 --> 784.75
incredibly quick yeah Wow

778.78 --> 789.97
alright yeah I got some from Aaron

784.75 --> 793.2
Armstrong and Brenda so I now have 29

789.97 --> 804.76
euros and 47 cents from that thank you

793.2 --> 808.1500000000001
thank you so much great start oh I only

804.76 --> 811.18
Schiphol can't see ya my my kind of

808.15 --> 815.8299999999999
default position was that I have like

811.18 --> 820.9499999999999
200 euros available so yeah whatever

815.83 --> 825.07
happens like I got like a personal

820.95 --> 828.5500000000001
escape route say for example a worst

825.07 --> 834.6400000000001
case scenario escape situation I don't

828.55 --> 838.81
know maybe I'm just being paranoid but I

834.64 --> 840.64
thought that with 200 euros I could yeah

838.81 --> 843.4799999999999
even if we were get stranded in the

840.64 --> 847.06
middle of nowhere potentially take taxi

843.48 --> 853.63
to somewhere and just literally travel

847.06 --> 857.9699999999999
back home yeah that kind of thing from

853.63 --> 862.42
London to the dams 47 one way alright

857.97 --> 866.0500000000001
okay anyway I'm gonna check through

862.42 --> 869.05
Google again let's see is there even an

866.05 --> 876.4799999999999
airport in Warsaw

869.05 --> 876.4799999999999
uh yeah it seems so

878.82 --> 883.98
Wow there's two airports that's crazy

889.13 --> 901.31
one has a lot higher score than the

891.93 --> 905.16
other all right Warsaw Chopin Airport

901.31 --> 911.43
seems to be having the highest score

905.16 --> 913.79
with votes from internet voting let's

911.43 --> 913.79
see

926.19 --> 931.6500000000001
[Music]

928.65 --> 931.65
whoa

942.26 --> 945.25
what is this

950.38 --> 953.71
yeah

952.03 --> 962.65
all right that's not what I was asking

953.71 --> 970.96
for six KLM flights it what Google is

962.65 --> 973.9
not helping out all right okay from what

970.96 --> 981.6
I'm seeing here somewhere says starting

973.9 --> 981.6
from 88 pounds so how much is that

984.21 --> 990.37
okay that's 99 euro so yeah that's a

987.22 --> 994.12
hundred euros and that's the start

990.37 --> 1000.8
starting price right so okay yeah I was

994.12 --> 1000.8
kind of correctly my original size up

1006.62 --> 1015.87
right it is the capital of Poland right

1009.42 --> 1018.959
look my my Eastern European what is it

1015.87 --> 1023.339
topography hasn't been brushed up for a

1018.959 --> 1025.289
long time so it's but right it does make

1023.339 --> 1028.76
sense that the capital city of Poland

1025.289 --> 1028.76
would definitely have an airport

1031.849 --> 1035.019
[Music]

1042.64 --> 1045.66
all right

1051.83 --> 1058.57
and and how does that work even like do

1056.149 --> 1063.2299999999998
you really have to book the flight

1058.57 --> 1064.85
specifically or is it can you even kind

1063.23 --> 1067.76
of do it like a train ticket and just

1064.85 --> 1070.37
get it at the spot or is it a lot more

1067.76 --> 1072.919
expensive how does it work

1070.37 --> 1075.4699999999998
because I I would dread to think that I

1072.919 --> 1078.289
might potentially miss the right time

1075.47 --> 1080.0
for a flight or I don't know if you can

1078.289 --> 1082.85
then just take the next slide I don't

1080.0 --> 1086.779
know how it works I lit literally never

1082.85 --> 1090.1689999999999
been on an airplane since I was like

1086.779 --> 1092.36
zero when I was a baby I happened to go

1090.169 --> 1102.529
on an airplane that's like the only time

1092.36 --> 1111.1689999999999
ever well I'll just prepare to not eat

1102.529 --> 1114.799
any meal at all how about that I'll just

1111.169 --> 1117.46
swallow a good handful of supplements

1114.799 --> 1124.8799999999999
and everything right before I go and

1117.46 --> 1128.71
I'll manage no problem I don't even know

1124.88 --> 1128.71
how long it is flight like that

1133.17 --> 1144.69
see it's not that long it's ridiculous

1137.81 --> 1147.81
like KLM flights non-stop for 150 euros

1144.69 --> 1152.73
our two hours and the longest flight are

1147.81 --> 1153.6299999999999
like four hours and 30 minutes oh no man

1152.73 --> 1157.65
I can't

1153.63 --> 1161.64
like survive without food for four and a

1157.65 --> 1173.97
half hours no now that's not gonna be an

1161.64 --> 1178.91
issue yeah only sheep who can't see the

1173.97 --> 1178.91
trip is starting Sunday in Amsterdam

1199.4 --> 1206.66
all right of course everyone a sec sure

1204.07 --> 1212.36
I'll be sure to look out of the window

1206.66 --> 1215.63
and check how Excel report back exactly

1406.91 --> 1415.64
a case well I'm just gonna have one just

1412.49 --> 1428.36
gonna one carry-on so a carry-on could

1415.64 --> 1432.3400000000001
that be because this is kind of like the

1428.36 --> 1432.34
only bag I really have at the moment

just gonna tank and eat up right before

1531.13 --> 1536.16
I go in the plane and then I hope I

1532.9 --> 1536.16
don't throw up or something

1536.25 --> 1542.2
bars are okay okay I'll try that I'll

1540.07 --> 1547.48
just bring some good food bars

1542.2 --> 1550.63
nothing wet ish

1547.48 --> 1553.3600000000001
but do they hand out like non

1550.63 --> 1557.3700000000001
fluoridated water bottles on the plane

1553.36 --> 1557.37
that kind of thing

1594.19 --> 1602.38
yeah you need shampoo i I just need

1597.64 --> 1606.22
toothpaste mostly in the toothbrush I'm

1602.38 --> 1610.3000000000002
gonna pretty much make sure that I I'm

1606.22 --> 1616.33
pretty fresh when I start well maybe I

1610.3 --> 1616.6599999999999
do kind of need yeah right yeah okay

1616.33 --> 1618.1

1618.1 --> 1622.54
gonna be weak traveling yeah you

1619.66 --> 1625.96
definitely kind of need to to take

1622.54 --> 1629.37
showers and stuff I get it right don't

1625.96 --> 1632.83
underestimate that nah I don't know

1629.37 --> 1634.81
everything I I need to take back with me

1632.83 --> 1647.29
I can definitely fit in that bag

1634.81 --> 1649.33
Oh Giulio Pavan really have whoa Wow

1647.29 --> 1652.6
Giulio Pavan thank you so much

1649.33 --> 1655.26
another twenty six dollars I'm over to

1652.6 --> 1663.0
200 now that's incredible

1655.26 --> 1663.0
Wow I'm going on the globe tour guys I

1665.91 --> 1671.0400000000002
don't know if I can actually do the

1668.29 --> 1674.4099999999999
early bird show during that though I

1671.04 --> 1679.86
might be able to but yeah I don't have

1674.41 --> 1683.3700000000001
like life streaming capabilities with me

1679.86 --> 1687.9399999999998
so maybe if I could use the device

1683.37 --> 1690.04
devices of others perhaps I maybe I

1687.94 --> 1692.98
could do it like through Roxanne's

1690.04 --> 1695.35
channel just do the early bird show on

1692.98 --> 1700.81
Roxanne's channel life and then later

1695.35 --> 1703.29
upload it that that seems like a lot of

1700.81 --> 1703.29
fun actually

1706.14 --> 1712.51
I'm almost dizzy here seriously I I was

1709.45 --> 1714.88
kind of holding myself back like oh my

1712.51 --> 1716.44
god all the over enthusiasm everybody's

1714.88 --> 1718.5
counting on me to do this and it's

1716.44 --> 1722.19
probably not gonna work out so I just

1718.5 --> 1722.19
but I guess it is

1723.529 --> 1726.529
Wow

1739.93 --> 1753.0700000000002
oh yeah don't say that people now but

1750.19 --> 1756.91
that's just the wise management self

1753.07 --> 1759.6699999999998
management look just for me there's

1756.91 --> 1762.01
nothing really worse than getting really

1759.67 --> 1764.14
caught up into wanting something because

1762.01 --> 1768.54
when I want something and think I'm

1764.14 --> 1768.5400000000002
gonna get it I like really a vest and

1769.95 --> 1775.29
yeah when you when there's basically a

1773.38 --> 1777.6100000000001
chance you're not gonna get it just the

1775.29 --> 1781.3899999999999
disappointment for me can be pretty

1777.61 --> 1785.77
mortifying so I just don't count on any

1781.39 --> 1794.5
of it until I'm absolutely sure that it

1785.77 --> 1797.85
can happen I don't need a bodyguard I am

1794.5 --> 1797.85
my own bodyguard really

1807.09 --> 1812.61
no AGM look don't think like that I

1810.57 --> 1814.769
don't think like that it's not about

1812.61 --> 1818.9599999999998
what I'm thinking it's about what I feel

1814.769 --> 1822.779
I don't feel like that

1818.96 --> 1825.1200000000001
look my thinking can be optimistic

1822.779 --> 1827.97
pessimistic that's going to influence

1825.12 --> 1830.639
I'm usually optimistic but I don't allow

1827.97 --> 1833.249
my feelings to embrace something yet if

1830.639 --> 1835.4699999999998
there's still a chance somehow that it

1833.249 --> 1838.23
can't happen especially if it's really

1835.47 --> 1842.45
appealing because the shock is always

1838.23 --> 1846.74
very big so I'm just being cautious

1842.45 --> 1846.74
that's how I usually do things

1860.89 --> 1868.529
[Music]

1864.35 --> 1872.4599999999998
yeah I'm gonna have to have weight and I

1868.529 --> 1874.38
could just say screw it yeah my

1872.46 --> 1876.24
newspaper rounds is gonna have to take a

1874.38 --> 1884.279
skip but yeah who cares

1876.24 --> 1887.36
one week yeah it's my first time going

1884.279 --> 1887.36
to Poland ever

1901.989 --> 1921.1390000000001
and I'm so nervous definitely get glad

1916.909 --> 1923.8990000000001
I'm getting my pants fixed because these

1921.139 --> 1927.1999999999998
freaking cheap fabric now both these

1923.899 --> 1928.7299999999998
pants have tears and knees it's just

1927.2 --> 1932.809
great but at least one of them is gonna

1928.73 --> 1938.09
be fixed it's very and even you're gonna

1932.809 --> 1941.799
be sitting in them for a week anxious

1938.09 --> 1945.259
not just excite you have a little just

1941.799 --> 1950.629
excited nervous but not negatively so

1945.259 --> 1956.96
just like like I kept going to

1950.629 --> 1959.059
Disneyland type that's it and also

1956.96 --> 1961.58
they're scary because I don't know I'm

1959.059 --> 1965.749
gonna feel about facing off against

1961.58 --> 1967.489
Mickey Mouse giant head on a person that

1965.749 --> 1969.549
has creepy vibes on it that kind of

1967.489 --> 1969.549
thing

1973.779 --> 1982.039
ladies really oh you mean on the

1978.95 --> 1987.919
conference is sure I'll do my best but

1982.039 --> 1991.279
look I'm just gonna be me I'm probably

1987.919 --> 1995.8400000000001
not gonna be like all talking all the

1991.279 --> 1999.649
because lots of attention it can be

1995.84 --> 2003.1899999999998
quite draining for me so I'll more than

1999.649 --> 2005.4089999999999
once will be just like walking away

2003.19 --> 2008.94
around the corner just wanting to be

2005.409 --> 2017.909
alone for like 15 minutes or something

2008.94 --> 2017.909
that's always been me but yeah man

2020.04 --> 2027.24
you're my dad all woman all over you

2024.31 --> 2027.24
though come on

2036.49 --> 2053.23
you're yeah you're making me nervous

2043.42 --> 2053.23
you're not helping peanuts Clark oh dear

2057.07 --> 2067.82
all right

2058.58 --> 2070.54
I am Aries 106 it's just that look I've

2067.82 --> 2074.32
done the opposite right but when I do I

2070.54 --> 2079.04
literally usually just start dominating

2074.32 --> 2081.53
in not a too healthy way like I don't

2079.04 --> 2085.55
know in the past when I got very

2081.53 --> 2091.159
blabbering people would eventually get

2085.55 --> 2095.32
sick of me you know my very very dear

2091.159 --> 2099.83
friends they know of this about me like

2095.32 --> 2102.4900000000002
once I get really really deep they know

2099.83 --> 2105.2599999999998
now like they can even say look I can't

2102.49 --> 2107.54
like have that long a conversation now

2105.26 --> 2116.6600000000003
because they know by the tone already

2107.54 --> 2118.79
like how far it's gonna go but yeah once

2116.66 --> 2122.99
I break open my mouth it can basically

2118.79 --> 2125.9
just never end but that's only in an

2122.99 --> 2134.109
where I yeah I think i can actually

2125.9 --> 2134.109
convey all of it which is not on air

2136.54 --> 2141.73
but in group situations I'm not like

2139.42 --> 2144.7000000000003
that well I don't feel comfortable to

2141.73 --> 2147.58
throw out like my very sensitive and

2144.7 --> 2150.5699999999997
freaky and conflicted and sometimes

2147.58 --> 2155.41
terrible terrifying in some way things

2150.57 --> 2158.2000000000003
into like ten people because I can't

2155.41 --> 2161.08
oversee what a little what it'll do to

2158.2 --> 2161.71
them because I have to adapt this kind

2161.08 --> 2166.6
of story

2161.71 --> 2170.29
this kind of depth story or yeah it'll

2166.6 --> 2173.56
run wild with people's imagination you

2170.29 --> 2179.05
know it's some of the [ __ ] I have to

2173.56 --> 2181.74
tell is quite shocking yeah and I know

2179.05 --> 2181.7400000000002
that from experience

2185.75 --> 2188.9
[Music]

2193.12 --> 2201.74
well spare-room music if my plane would

2196.82 --> 2204.5
be spreading chemtrail i'd say yeah it's

2201.74 --> 2208.6699999999996
a fully-automated and I don't think the

2204.5 --> 2211.61
pilot probably has any say in it it's

2208.67 --> 2214.19
just an installed secondary mechanism

2211.61 --> 2216.77
that is remote-controlled activated and

2214.19 --> 2219.62
I'll I'll be checking for it if it's

2216.77 --> 2221.57
doing that and where it's coming from if

2219.62 --> 2225.17
it is actually coming from the engine or

2221.57 --> 2241.8500000000004
some other part sure I'll keep an eye

2225.17 --> 2244.25
open oh stop it be nuts Clark Jesus I'm

2241.85 --> 2247.15
not looking for some kind of sodomy

2244.25 --> 2247.15
spree okay

2264.18 --> 2271.72
but yeah I don't know look meeting new

2267.79 --> 2275.2799999999997
people stuff yeah I might who knows

2271.72 --> 2275.2799999999997
what's gonna happen I don't know

2279.7 --> 2284.0
[Music]

2288.02 --> 2296.82
[Music]

2302.0 --> 2310.41
Amsterdam romance that sounds very

2306.93 --> 2312.72
dubious to me personally but I don't

2310.41 --> 2315.089
know look I'm not looking for that [ __ ]

2312.72 --> 2320.7
if I would be then I can guaranteed not

2315.089 --> 2323.7889999999998
to find it I'm still looking to build

2320.7 --> 2327.27
myself up I'm not technically even ready

2323.789 --> 2330.0
to engage in anything because if I would

2327.27 --> 2334.16
go fool around and bond while I'm still

2330.0 --> 2337.17
not fine you have fully founded like

2334.16 --> 2340.109
where I could basically say save myself

2337.17 --> 2344.609
completely even if I were to be caught

2340.109 --> 2348.93
off somehow yeah you're definitely

2344.609 --> 2352.14
helping me financially out but like I

2348.93 --> 2356.43
need some kind of stable foundation in

2352.14 --> 2358.5589999999997
order to to get serious again because

2356.43 --> 2363.5989999999997
that is exactly where it went wrong with

2358.559 --> 2366.1400000000003
my ex-girlfriend on the on the long run

2363.599 --> 2371.099
of it the whole yeah that the several

2366.14 --> 2374.96
steps downwards all resulted from B me

2371.099 --> 2378.9300000000003
basically not taking financial

2374.96 --> 2381.51
responsibility for myself in the hopes

2378.93 --> 2383.5789999999997
that my ex-girlfriend would that now

2381.51 --> 2386.67
seems very embarrassing to me but yes

2383.579 --> 2389.1600000000003
she was freaking dentist and I was very

2386.67 --> 2392.779
liberal minded I thought yeah sure why

2389.16 --> 2397.2
not now I realize of course that that

2392.779 --> 2399.27
yeah you know I wouldn't Benjamin talks

2397.2 --> 2402.8089999999997
a lot about it well what he's talking

2399.27 --> 2407.609
about I've lived through that not all of

2402.809 --> 2410.19
it though thank God but like the the

2407.609 --> 2414.119
silent responses and all that and there

2410.19 --> 2417.569
was just so much so much that I just

2414.119 --> 2421.25
completely got wrong with my ex as the

2417.569 --> 2426.21
relationship was gonna she would be very

2421.25 --> 2429.089
Dutch German like very silent and strong

2426.21 --> 2434.279
and just don't talk about that [ __ ] and

2429.089 --> 2434.819
I did not I did not come out of that

2434.279 --> 2439.709
right

2434.819 --> 2444.779
and it is all because I basically could

2439.709 --> 2449.519
not get myself to to accept that I need

2444.779 --> 2452.759
to be financially self-sufficient at

2449.519 --> 2458.819
least in order for just a relationship

2452.759 --> 2462.499
to be manageable it's not about if the

2458.819 --> 2466.41
unit can survive financially it's about

2462.499 --> 2474.979
me having the help with in any kind of

2466.41 --> 2477.569
relationship that I desire like yeah

2474.979 --> 2480.689
otherwise it's good it's going to

2477.569 --> 2487.859
degenerate me and what I try to do it's

2480.689 --> 2492.239
not gonna work out if I don't so I'm

2487.859 --> 2496.769
just not really really up to up to it

2492.239 --> 2501.029
yet you know but look a little flirting

2496.769 --> 2509.3999999999996
or whatever I'm fine flirting I kind of

2501.029 --> 2511.469
like flirting so hey if there's a woman

2509.4 --> 2513.659
and I think they're attractive in some

2511.469 --> 2518.88
way then I'd love I always love to

2513.659 --> 2524.2490000000003
basically complement them by showing

2518.88 --> 2526.38
them exactly that I see how how how good

2524.249 --> 2528.9489999999996
their quality is basically this is what

2526.38 --> 2528.949
I like to do

2530.98 --> 2537.43
so they get some kind of feeling of

2534.19 --> 2541.51
recognition that they're actually being

2537.43 --> 2543.7799999999997
seen and understood that's what I like

2541.51 --> 2543.78
to do

2567.37 --> 2573.92
Wow it's been a crazy show today

2571.48 --> 2583.43
couldn't believe that just all happened

2573.92 --> 2587.48
oh yeah what the [ __ ]

2583.43 --> 2590.4199999999996
Jose that's crazy no I'll just tell them

2587.48 --> 2594.98
exactly what I feel and then leave then

2590.42 --> 2597.59
just watch what they want I'm not gonna

2594.98 --> 2603.02
talk about babies like that unless there

2597.59 --> 2605.57
is a mental connection like a real

2603.02 --> 2607.37
understanding on the level that and that

2605.57 --> 2610.34
I had that with my freaking ex okay

2607.37 --> 2614.81
that's so rare that you're on the level

2610.34 --> 2617.21
before that the mental connection is

2614.81 --> 2626.0
there even before there is an attractive

2617.21 --> 2627.89
connection and then I can basically then

2626.0 --> 2628.91
you can get on the level when you know

2627.89 --> 2632.15
like okay

2628.91 --> 2634.37
we we can be absolutely straight and

2632.15 --> 2635.63
honest there's a connection and then you

2634.37 --> 2638.6
ask like you know what do you really

2635.63 --> 2641.12
want out of life and you just get honest

2638.6 --> 2644.45
with one another and then you see if you

2641.12 --> 2648.44
can do something with that that's like

2644.45 --> 2650.96
the real life contracts really that's

2648.44 --> 2655.52
when they happen they hadn't happened

2650.96 --> 2658.37
very subtly that's when big decisions

2655.52 --> 2661.48
are made so

2658.37 --> 2661.48
[Music]

2670.14 --> 2677.4
[Music]

2672.619 --> 2681.9
Ares 1:06 I look I'd I technically don't

2677.4 --> 2685.32
even know anymore and when I do that

2681.9 --> 2688.44
kind of thing if you say that right and

2685.32 --> 2690.96
if I'm gonna yeah look at this point I

2688.44 --> 2693.7200000000003
would basically be describing the type

2690.96 --> 2697.859
that my axes because I happen to have

2693.72 --> 2701.25
like a very almost painful strong

2697.859 --> 2703.23
attraction to that type but that doesn't

2701.25 --> 2705.99
mean that I don't find other types of

2703.23 --> 2708.93
women attractive as well because I've

2705.99 --> 2711.45
had seriously just well you could you're

2708.93 --> 2713.91
not gonna but I remember all the faces

2711.45 --> 2718.1299999999997
of the girlfriends that I had and my god

2713.91 --> 2718.1299999999997
they were all just completely different

2718.52 --> 2724.08
the only thing that they really did

2721.23 --> 2727.17
share is that they were all yeah they

2724.08 --> 2733.41
were all fair-skinned as it were I've

2727.17 --> 2739.6800000000003
never yeah gone beyond that but all

2733.41 --> 2745.02
types all hair colors and just even like

2739.68 --> 2747.8999999999996
small girls long I've had a relationship

2745.02 --> 2751.65
with the girl that was over over six

2747.9 --> 2755.42
foot well was it six foot five or

2751.65 --> 2761.4900000000002
something was pretty pretty long so that

2755.42 --> 2767.4500000000003
all kinds but yeah my ex-man that's just

2761.49 --> 2775.109
a certain type it is it is kind of

2767.45 --> 2777.35
slightly Eastern European type she yeah

2775.109 --> 2780.389
my ex was half German

2777.35 --> 2780.389
[Music]

2780.61 --> 2789.6600000000003
and I don't know yet just yeah I find a

2786.16 --> 2789.66
lot of German women very attractive

2801.63 --> 2819.9500000000003
but yeah that's

2804.77 --> 2823.19
I don't know that's the weird thing

2819.95 --> 2826.91
I like I find all kind of women kind

2823.19 --> 2828.05
really yeah really attractive that are

2826.91 --> 2832.54
very different

2828.05 --> 2839.4500000000003
oh wow

2832.54 --> 2844.13
even more better dude damn I already had

2839.45 --> 2844.5499999999997
me I had plenty but I guess even more

2844.13 --> 2846.88
now

2844.55 --> 2846.88
damn

2852.54 --> 2860.7
sheesh wow thanks thanks flat earth dude

2857.64 --> 2872.52
another 26 euros on top of that I'm now

2860.7 --> 2874.2599999999998
at 235 huh it's kind of odd though but I

2872.52 --> 2876.03
guess this is kind of like a unique

2874.26 --> 2880.3500000000004
opportunity thing that it will work is

2876.03 --> 2883.8
it's just that like wow it took me more

2880.35 --> 2886.56
than half a year for my p900

2883.8 --> 2894.42
but this thing was it just within an

2886.56 --> 2901.37
hour incredible oh where are you staying

2894.42 --> 2906.33
in Warsaw I don't know exactly but the

2901.37 --> 2912.1099999999997
the what is it the the tour bus is gonna

2906.33 --> 2912.11
have a two-day stay basically in Warsaw

2915.2 --> 2924.1699999999996
God's house they stop it stop this I

2919.61 --> 2927.1200000000003
don't like that look I'm really a very

2924.17 --> 2931.41
old-fashioned person when it comes to

2927.12 --> 2936.15
relationships I'm actually the silly

2931.41 --> 2941.0099999999998
type of guy that would kind of prefer to

2936.15 --> 2943.71
meet the parents yeah because then I get

2941.01 --> 2948.0600000000004
to actually see a lot as to where it's

2943.71 --> 2952.14
coming from and that type it I know I

2948.06 --> 2955.11
know it's so last century but this whole

2952.14 --> 2957.5699999999997
new sort of me for everyone you can out

2955.11 --> 2962.09
[ __ ] everything nobody cares anyway I I

2957.57 --> 2969.78
really don't like it I don't like this

2962.09 --> 2972.6000000000004
I'm old fashioned and that doesn't mean

2969.78 --> 2975.5400000000004
that I haven't had sort of my share of

2972.6 --> 2977.4
kind of doing that even when I was yeah

2975.54 --> 2980.72
well not very Christian let's just say

2977.4 --> 2985.14
it like that resentful also to society

2980.72 --> 2986.3399999999997
but yeah when I did that you know they

2985.14 --> 2988.29
say this about women

2986.34 --> 2990.54
that do that did just sleep around and

2988.29 --> 2992.67
every weekend some random guy or

2990.54 --> 2998.57
whatever and that they feel all sick the

2992.67 --> 3001.9700000000003
next day well let me tell ya so do i

2998.57 --> 3005.1800000000003
okay you think that what but you're a

3001.97 --> 3009.5
guy you should be proud

3005.18 --> 3011.7799999999997
no and it's not that I'm doing anything

3009.5 --> 3017.3
weird or anything you you know during

3011.78 --> 3029.0
these kind of things it's just that it's

3017.3 --> 3031.9700000000003
not very gratifying to me well I

3029.0 --> 3035.32
wouldn't necessarily go for marriage

3031.97 --> 3041.27
before anything okay

3035.32 --> 3043.34
but yeah I'm not that old-fashioned like

3041.27 --> 3044.78
I'm not gonna demand yeah we're not

3043.34 --> 3050.42
gonna have sex before we get married

3044.78 --> 3053.69
like that's gonna be very weird and you

3050.42 --> 3055.73
know I do find well sexual interaction

3053.69 --> 3059.42
is kind of still important with me I

3055.73 --> 3062.27
guess it's part of the bonding process

3059.42 --> 3064.88
there's just so much more in a

3062.27 --> 3071.57
relationship that's really good that you

3064.88 --> 3075.53
can do it's just incredible and but yeah

3071.57 --> 3078.8300000000004
I'm just don't like screwing around and

3075.53 --> 3085.78
and just throwing it to the side I think

3078.83 --> 3085.7799999999997
it's it's just terribly ineffective

3090.01 --> 3103.25
seven eight babies well I don't know

3094.09 --> 3105.88
what Joe said that what the hell are you

3103.25 --> 3105.88
crazy

3111.03 --> 3132.63
fifty dollars really huh it may not have

3120.4 --> 3132.63
arrived yet but oh okay that's fine

3140.76 --> 3148.1800000000003
anyway about the babies yeah sure but

3145.39 --> 3151.18
that's not something I would technically

3148.18 --> 3156.16
start engaging it just right away like

3151.18 --> 3159.19
that you know you kind of have to build

3156.16 --> 3164.589
up to that you kind of have to prepare

3159.19 --> 3167.109
the grounds it's getting children really

3164.589 --> 3168.46
is like a big operation if you want to

3167.109 --> 3170.44
do it right if you just gotta try to

3168.46 --> 3175.75
improvise everything it's gonna get

3170.44 --> 3178.9900000000002
screwy and yeah Outsiders could try to

3175.75 --> 3181.119
take control somehow in some way and you

3178.99 --> 3183.52
don't want that has to be properly

3181.119 --> 3187.329
prepared and mentally prepared for also

3183.52 --> 3196.41
to not take easy ways out because they

3187.329 --> 3196.4100000000003
seem a good idea that kind of thing what

3199.93 --> 3210.5989999999997
really okay Jarek metate Mateos thank
