82.24 --> 88.15899999999999
very unexpectedly the weather today just

85.6 --> 88.15899999999999
like what

89.36 --> 94.159
what just happened

91.84 --> 97.36
it's super

94.159 --> 98.799
blue skies

97.36 --> 101.84
with this

98.799 --> 101.84
incredible sun

102.88 --> 108.399
it's still a little

104.88 --> 111.439
chilly outside but yeah with that sun

108.399 --> 115.28
it's just really oh hold on

111.439 --> 118.52
nice and warm what the

115.28 --> 118.52
hold on

258.079 --> 262.8
ah

260.479 --> 264.32
that was unexpected

262.8 --> 268.36
right

264.32 --> 268.36
yeah that was my healer calling

268.8 --> 274.96000000000004
i kind of tried to call him this morning

271.919 --> 274.96
for a quick checkup

275.199 --> 279.44
but he's very busy guys so yeah he

277.199 --> 282.0
called me

279.44 --> 284.16
right when my show started but yeah i

282.0 --> 287.28
got it over quickly my condition was

284.16 --> 287.28000000000003
very good actually

287.36 --> 294.0
considering the overall circumstances

290.639 --> 294.0
and now i'm doing even better

294.4 --> 297.52
ah

295.36 --> 300.40000000000003
hello isles g ooh

297.52 --> 302.79999999999995
suggestions for dealing with tooth pain

300.4 --> 302.79999999999995
yes

302.96 --> 307.19899999999996
i have done i've dealt with that a lot

307.52 --> 313.919
right so if it is like a typical

310.96 --> 315.75899999999996
nerve getting hit type of thing

313.919 --> 318.56
which could be well it could be the

315.759 --> 320.56
tooth but it could also simply be like

318.56 --> 322.16
cold like symptoms where there's just

320.56 --> 324.96
suddenly

322.16 --> 327.44
slight inflammation

324.96 --> 329.35999999999996
in the jaw area

327.44 --> 331.6
doesn't have to be something really bad

329.36 --> 334.0
it could just be a temporary reaction

331.6 --> 335.84000000000003
that could push on it right so anything

334.0 --> 340.32
related to that

335.84 --> 342.96
my first go-to would be magnesium

340.32 --> 344.639
as a an acute

342.96 --> 346.56
short term

344.639 --> 349.759
pain relief because that's something

346.56 --> 352.56
that i figured out some time ago

349.759 --> 355.12
it works really well

352.56 --> 356.639
like you're like ah

355.12 --> 358.319
it hurts

356.639 --> 360.08
up and down whatever

358.319 --> 363.759
and then like okay

360.08 --> 363.75899999999996
just some magnesium in water

364.84 --> 368.56
like

366.639 --> 369.919
flush it all around and you'll be

368.56 --> 372.639
surprised

369.919 --> 374.96
at least i was that works on me i don't

372.639 --> 376.16
know i have not

374.96 --> 379.84
actually

376.16 --> 381.199
heard anybody reflect on that just yet

379.84 --> 382.71999999999997
probably because when people have

381.199 --> 384.24
toothache they just don't want to talk

382.72 --> 386.08000000000004
about it they just want to forget it

384.24 --> 387.36
exists

386.08 --> 390.479
right

387.36 --> 394.039
but you could try that if you have some

390.479 --> 394.039
and i have

394.319 --> 398.08000000000004
magnesium citrate for that it's super

396.88 --> 399.12
cheap

398.08 --> 402.56
it's like

399.12 --> 405.039
five dollars probably five euros

402.56 --> 406.84
and you have like a

405.039 --> 410.71999999999997
lifetime supply

406.84 --> 410.71999999999997
almost it's just powder

411.199 --> 416.40000000000003
get a microscopic bit

414.8 --> 420.08
just nothing

416.4 --> 423.84
almost nothing in a bit of water

420.08 --> 423.84
let's dissolve it

424.479 --> 428.71999999999997
and then flush around with it

426.4 --> 430.479
worth a shot win up all night oh yeah

428.72 --> 432.88000000000005
then if it's like keeping you up

430.479 --> 436.71999999999997
definitely try that

432.88 --> 439.039
and i'd be curious to hear

436.72 --> 441.52000000000004
did that actually work right

439.039 --> 443.52
what i noticed about it it like acutely

441.52 --> 447.44
works against it like it immediately

443.52 --> 449.599
soothes it immediately immediately

447.44 --> 452.4
that's the part i'm curious about

449.599 --> 454.319
it doesn't take it all away long run and

452.4 --> 456.479
like

454.319 --> 459.12
it probably won't work if you just keep

456.479 --> 460.71999999999997
magnesium

459.12 --> 462.479
water

460.72 --> 467.44000000000005
in your mouth all day that's not gonna

462.479 --> 467.44
make it go away really so it is like a

468.879 --> 473.91900000000004
it's really against the pain

471.44 --> 476.71999999999997
and yeah if if there's nothing really

473.919 --> 476.71999999999997
bad going on

477.52 --> 482.79999999999995
like not too bad

480.56 --> 484.8
then hopefully it'll just go away again

482.8 --> 487.039
it'll just be like an annoying little

484.8 --> 487.039
thing

488.56 --> 494.72
i wish you the best of luck lg

492.4 --> 497.039
i know exactly how annoying that sort of

494.72 --> 501.28000000000003
thing is

497.039 --> 503.68
i'm very lucky i feel very lucky that i

501.28 --> 505.19899999999996
i have very little issues these days

503.68 --> 508.40000000000003
with my jaw

505.199 --> 511.759
and i still have a freaking

508.4 --> 513.039
halfway broken tooth here right for over

511.759 --> 514.719
a year

513.039 --> 517.12
and it's been giving me all kinds of

514.719 --> 520.8000000000001
weird issues

517.12 --> 522.64
but no pain anymore

520.8 --> 526.399
might also be because probably yeah it

522.64 --> 526.399
could be that the nerf just died

526.48 --> 530.72
but hey as long as i can still use it

531.12 --> 536.32
at least if i i can literally now chew

533.44 --> 538.24
with it like i just eat bread and [ __ ]

536.32 --> 540.1600000000001
only issue is that something can get

538.24 --> 542.88
basically stuck

540.16 --> 542.88
in the craft

543.12 --> 547.68
where it had broken off and if i'm not

545.2 --> 550.08
careful and like squish something in it

547.68 --> 552.56
with full power then i literally like

550.08 --> 554.0
rip into my flesh that that can hurt i'm

552.56 --> 555.5999999999999
very careful about that but other than

554.0 --> 556.56
that it just doesn't give me any issues

555.6 --> 559.0400000000001
anymore

556.56 --> 560.88
it could also be i'm not having any pain

559.04 --> 564.64
issues because i've been using the

560.88 --> 565.68
magnesium for like half a year

564.64 --> 567.92
so

565.68 --> 567.92
right

572.959 --> 576.88
i have a broken tooth

574.64 --> 578.56
for two years whoa that's a long time

576.88 --> 580.08
it's only the second time i've had pain

578.56 --> 582.7199999999999
okay

580.08 --> 585.519
right then it is if it's been there for

582.72 --> 587.839
us that long then it is probably just a

585.519 --> 590.0
like a cold side effect

587.839 --> 591.6
yeah we've been hanging around with two

590.0 --> 593.68
years

591.6 --> 597.6800000000001
it could also be that

593.68 --> 597.68
it's kind of working its way out

599.12 --> 603.279
like there is a chance that like

601.279 --> 606.079
the rest of the nerves will kind of just

603.279 --> 610.0
like get infected doesn't have to be

606.079 --> 610.0
super dangerous or painful and then

610.16 --> 614.48
especially if you have a good immune

612.24 --> 615.76
system lots of vitamin c and all that

614.48 --> 618.32
healthy food

615.76 --> 619.8389999999999
that ill there is a chance that over

618.32 --> 622.6400000000001
time simply

619.839 --> 624.72
the nerf will retract and then suddenly

622.64 --> 626.0
bloop one day you notice that your tooth

624.72 --> 628.72
is kind of loose

626.0 --> 630.48
and then you could potentially just

628.72 --> 634.32
even

630.48 --> 634.32
pick it out without any hurt

636.72 --> 639.6
but that could take a very long time by

638.72 --> 641.279
the way

639.6 --> 644.0
decades even

641.279 --> 647.16
anyway yeah i wish you the best of luck

644.0 --> 647.16
with that

653.44 --> 658.0
changes orientation

655.36 --> 661.04
yeah that's with me as well

658.0 --> 662.88
it couldn't be because simply your jaw

661.04 --> 664.88
the way your teeth are arranged kind of

662.88 --> 667.2
like it reorientates itself over your

664.88 --> 669.4399999999999
lifetime

667.2 --> 672.0
and could be that with this one it was

669.44 --> 674.8800000000001
literally like under pressure too much

672.0 --> 677.36
and then at some point it just snapped

674.88 --> 679.68
and like a shard on the back side just

677.36 --> 683.2
snapped off it at first it was stuck and

679.68 --> 683.1999999999999
i had to literally pull it out

685.04 --> 688.4399999999999
at some point

693.519 --> 697.839
but yeah that that could simply be

695.6 --> 699.76
that's a part of it indeed snap because

697.839 --> 702.9590000000001
it was under pressure and your teeth are

699.76 --> 705.519
trying to constantly arrange themselves

702.959 --> 708.3199999999999
in a stable way that the pressures are

705.519 --> 711.519
divided relatively equally so that when

708.32 --> 713.9200000000001
you press down with your jaw

711.519 --> 717.92
there's no asymmetry in the in the

713.92 --> 719.76
pressure divisions very important

717.92 --> 723.8389999999999
anyway

719.76 --> 723.8389999999999
hello old men pilky

726.56 --> 730.279
alright so

734.639 --> 740.32
right

736.56 --> 744.0
yeah i watched back yesterday's stream

740.32 --> 745.9200000000001
and it was good

744.0 --> 748.32
i'm really surprised it didn't get more

745.92 --> 748.3199999999999
views

754.959 --> 759.4399999999999
all right

757.279 --> 763.12
friday my friday show by the way got a

759.44 --> 766.0790000000001
lot of views 385 according to

763.12 --> 771.079
this register here

766.079 --> 771.079
it's quite a lot for my streams and oh

772.079 --> 777.92
so did wednesday

774.399 --> 777.92
even more 391.

783.279 --> 788.959
anyway

785.2 --> 788.9590000000001
yeah i'm happy to report

789.279 --> 795.2
i watched the berettaria documentary i

792.24 --> 797.76
actually did that saturday

795.2 --> 800.639
but i didn't get to that yesterday it

797.76 --> 802.639
was preoccupied with the two subjects of

800.639 --> 804.8
the yesterday show

802.639 --> 806.9590000000001
but yeah i watched it

804.8 --> 806.959
on

807.04 --> 810.519
what is it beartauria.com

811.36 --> 817.2
it was everything that i expected it to

813.68 --> 817.1999999999999
be and it was great

819.68 --> 823.68
this it was a nice

821.68 --> 826.0
and

823.68 --> 826.8
like personal

826.0 --> 829.04
well

826.8 --> 830.8
it was just like

829.04 --> 832.399
just based

830.8 --> 833.519
and like

832.399 --> 837.76
people

833.519 --> 837.76
everybody that got on camera oops

840.8 --> 844.88
like they're all individuals and they

842.72 --> 846.72
all had like a bit of vulnerability to

844.88 --> 848.399
them in their own way it was they were

846.72 --> 850.8000000000001
all just people

848.399 --> 854.0
and good people that are having their

850.8 --> 855.04
own struggles and that are like really

854.0 --> 857.36
building

855.04 --> 860.0
so yeah i'm very impressed

857.36 --> 862.16
looking forward to that second one

860.0 --> 863.6
which own benjamin has said he's already

862.16 --> 864.7199999999999
shot it so

863.6 --> 868.9590000000001
like

864.72 --> 868.9590000000001
well done man well done it's awesome

869.519 --> 873.92
uh

871.519 --> 877.279
also watched

873.92 --> 879.8389999999999
like the interview videos he's he's done

877.279 --> 882.959
he's done two now so watch the second

879.839 --> 886.8000000000001
one also this morning

882.959 --> 886.8
very short but to the point

887.68 --> 889.92
uh

892.959 --> 897.199
ah

894.959 --> 899.68
yeah that's that's hilarious old man

897.199 --> 899.68
pilkey

899.76 --> 904.399
if earth was a sphere wouldn't the

901.92 --> 905.92
bottom of the ocean take up less space

904.399 --> 908.16
than the surface

905.92 --> 909.68
of the water

908.16 --> 911.76
yeah

909.68 --> 913.5999999999999
if if it was literally a spherical

911.76 --> 916.639
geometry

913.6 --> 918.639
it would and it's not

916.639 --> 921.6
like there would be complications even

918.639 --> 923.279
with buildings with high-rise buildings

921.6 --> 926.16
right

923.279 --> 928.959
in large cities the high-rise buildings

926.16 --> 931.759
they would all be further away

928.959 --> 931.7589999999999
at the tops

932.32 --> 936.399
as as at the bottom

938.639 --> 943.6800000000001
that as well

941.759 --> 947.04
like even if they're all exactly the

943.68 --> 949.4399999999999
same length the same width at the bottom

947.04 --> 951.5999999999999
as at the top then all the high-rises

949.44 --> 952.8000000000001
tops should all be further away from

951.6 --> 954.639
each other

952.8 --> 955.5999999999999
than at the bottom

954.639 --> 956.88
right

955.6 --> 957.839
i think that's like the train of

956.88 --> 959.759
thinking

957.839 --> 961.9200000000001
you're following and it is true right

959.759 --> 964.5600000000001
but it's so ridiculous because the earth

961.92 --> 966.399
is just blatantly not a sphere

964.56 --> 968.4799999999999
and these types of science fiction

966.399 --> 970.959
realizations about what it would be like

968.48 --> 970.9590000000001
on the ball

971.759 --> 976.9590000000001
yeah you really have to get into

975.04 --> 979.12
imagining what the earth as a bow is

976.959 --> 981.279
like in order to even

979.12 --> 984.32
start noticing that

981.279 --> 984.32
ballers don't do that

984.56 --> 988.6389999999999
they don't like to be reminded about

986.24 --> 991.759
natural consequences

988.639 --> 991.759
of sphere claims

995.6 --> 1000.9590000000001
and of course yeah the curvature

999.199 --> 1002.7199999999999
that as well

1000.959 --> 1005.1199999999999
and they would be at an angle yeah yeah

1002.72 --> 1005.12
all that

1007.519 --> 1013.68
but technically

1010.72 --> 1016.72
like if you have a strong computer with

1013.68 --> 1018.4799999999999
a good simulator you can just like

1016.72 --> 1021.44
have a

1018.48 --> 1023.04
rough simulation of earth

1021.44 --> 1025.28
as a sphere

1023.04 --> 1026.3999999999999
and then it's kind of like what google

1025.28 --> 1028.319
earth

1026.4 --> 1029.679
does

1028.319 --> 1032.799
except

1029.679 --> 1035.6000000000001
yeah they they tinker it they think it's

1032.799 --> 1036.799
not really literally the sphere model

1035.6 --> 1037.9189999999999
anymore

1036.799 --> 1039.9189999999999
because then there would be the

1037.919 --> 1041.2800000000002
geometric consequences and they'd like

1039.919 --> 1043.1200000000001
to believe that

1041.28 --> 1045.6789999999999
they'd like people that use it to

1043.12 --> 1047.6789999999999
believe that

1045.679 --> 1050.48
it is real

1047.679 --> 1052.799
that google earth rep this fear even

1050.48 --> 1055.28
that it represents the real world

1052.799 --> 1057.28
so that's why that when you zoom in

1055.28 --> 1059.44
suddenly it all becomes flat again so

1057.28 --> 1060.799
that when you look at the horizon it

1059.44 --> 1063.44
actually

1060.799 --> 1066.799
represents what you would see

1063.44 --> 1070.0800000000002
if you stand in that location

1066.799 --> 1071.6
but if there was a genuine sphere earth

1070.08 --> 1072.8799999999999
model

1071.6 --> 1075.28
you could simulate and you could

1072.88 --> 1077.5200000000002
literally just see this is how it would

1075.28 --> 1077.52
look

1078.24 --> 1082.559
and there would be barely any far

1081.12 --> 1085.9189999999999
distant sites

1082.559 --> 1085.9189999999999
that just wouldn't exist

1089.28 --> 1092.28
uh

1106.64 --> 1111.8400000000001
it should be part of a calculation by

1108.96 --> 1116.0
experts incur yeah but there is

1111.84 --> 1118.559
there is no curve so an expert in curve

1116.0 --> 1120.96
they're really supposed expert they are

1118.559 --> 1123.039
going to be an expert at reifying the

1120.96 --> 1124.88
curve and to do that they have to

1123.039 --> 1127.28
actually trick you

1124.88 --> 1129.44
into believing it's curved they can't

1127.28 --> 1132.16
actually just start reminding you about

1129.44 --> 1133.2
actual curvature consequences and all

1132.16 --> 1136.2
that

1133.2 --> 1136.2
right

1144.08 --> 1147.08
hmm

1159.44 --> 1162.44
and

1186.24 --> 1190.1200000000001
yeah i know godzilla

1193.6 --> 1196.559
they do what they do

1203.2 --> 1206.6000000000001
by the way

1207.44 --> 1212.799
yeah i'm playing a new game

1210.4 --> 1215.76
and i talked about it yesterday

1212.799 --> 1217.84
pathfinder king maker

1215.76 --> 1219.52
i managed to actually successfully

1217.84 --> 1222.24
install it

1219.52 --> 1225.36
had some issues like just wouldn't

1222.24 --> 1228.159
it it kept breaking weird

1225.36 --> 1230.799
but i managed to fix it and it works

1228.159 --> 1235.7600000000002
very smoothly

1230.799 --> 1236.799
it's a very very smooth game like

1235.76 --> 1240.08
there are

1236.799 --> 1242.6399999999999
no hiccups at all it's so smooth

1240.08 --> 1244.72
incredible

1242.64 --> 1245.5200000000002
and

1244.72 --> 1247.76
it's

1245.52 --> 1250.08
it's less goofy than i thought it would

1247.76 --> 1252.96
be so far

1250.08 --> 1255.9189999999999
it's actually quite decent

1252.96 --> 1257.44
so i'm very curious to see like what my

1255.919 --> 1259.6000000000001
entire experience with this game will be

1257.44 --> 1261.3600000000001
i'm very sure i'm going to be having a

1259.6 --> 1264.1589999999999
lot of fun with it

1261.36 --> 1266.7199999999998
and i'm gonna try to not overdo it

1264.159 --> 1270.5590000000002
right so i actually went to bed super

1266.72 --> 1270.559
early yesterday i'm so proud of it

1270.72 --> 1273.6000000000001
like around two

1273.84 --> 1278.3999999999999
when yeah normally when i break open a

1276.0 --> 1279.28
new game that seems to be very cool i

1278.4 --> 1281.3600000000001
just

1279.28 --> 1283.039
wouldn't stop playing it and then it'd

1281.36 --> 1285.039
be like six or eight o'clock in the

1283.039 --> 1286.8799999999999
morning well that's not gonna happen

1285.039 --> 1290.0
today

1286.88 --> 1293.679
or yesterday

1290.0 --> 1293.679
because i have a show to run

1298.159 --> 1302.0800000000002
but it looks very promising

1301.12 --> 1305.039
it's like

1302.08 --> 1307.1999999999998
the first rpg based game that actually

1305.039 --> 1309.679
gives me the feeling like wow this might

1307.2 --> 1312.24
actually kind of almost live up to the

1309.679 --> 1315.44
baldur's gate game quality

1312.24 --> 1317.6
one and two because the third one

1315.44 --> 1320.3200000000002
it's so many issues

1317.6 --> 1322.9599999999998
and it's it's not even complete

1320.32 --> 1325.12
and already i already paid more for that

1322.96 --> 1328.0
game than i did for baldur's gate 2 and

1325.12 --> 1330.6399999999999
expansion together

1328.0 --> 1332.64
and the new game isn't even complete

1330.64 --> 1336.96
and it has a lot of bugs because they

1332.64 --> 1336.96
had to do it all 3d again oh

1338.48 --> 1344.919
you have to have camera view and uh

1341.919 --> 1344.919
anyway

1346.4 --> 1350.88
like baldur's gate 3 i don't know it

1348.32 --> 1352.0
might be considered a pretty decent rpg

1350.88 --> 1355.8400000000001
game

1352.0 --> 1358.0
but it doff does not i'm sorry

1355.84 --> 1359.36
team of makers you know you've been

1358.0 --> 1363.679
doing your best there's interesting

1359.36 --> 1364.8799999999999
developments in it but it it does not

1363.679 --> 1366.96
live up

1364.88 --> 1368.0800000000002
to the polish gate

1366.96 --> 1369.6000000000001
legend

1368.08 --> 1371.76
at all

1369.6 --> 1374.3999999999999
especially if it's not just this one

1371.76 --> 1376.799
freaking area

1374.4 --> 1376.799
anyway

1377.679 --> 1382.679
enough about that a tasmanian truther

1414.24 --> 1419.1200000000001
right also one thing i really noticed

1416.559 --> 1420.1589999999999
about the game so far no

1419.12 --> 1422.559
uh

1420.159 --> 1424.88
pathfinder king maker

1422.559 --> 1427.6789999999999
and now i have i altogether like played

1424.88 --> 1429.5200000000002
it maybe four hours

1427.679 --> 1431.76
but what's really standing out to me is

1429.52 --> 1434.48
that the music is

1431.76 --> 1437.52
decent quality but it's like

1434.48 --> 1441.039
it's composed to be

1437.52 --> 1442.96
kind of like background stuff

1441.039 --> 1445.2
right when baldur's gate

1442.96 --> 1446.4
the baldur's gate music that was like

1445.2 --> 1450.0
really

1446.4 --> 1452.159
really epic like really epic

1450.0 --> 1454.24
and not like oh special boy epic but

1452.159 --> 1456.24
just really epic

1454.24 --> 1459.2
very classical

1456.24 --> 1461.6
very

1459.2 --> 1465.6000000000001
let me say that

1461.6 --> 1467.279
uh uh i forgot the word very cliche but

1465.6 --> 1469.1999999999998
in a good way

1467.279 --> 1470.799
like putting together everything that is

1469.2 --> 1472.48
really great

1470.799 --> 1476.799
and really serious

1472.48 --> 1476.799
and this game does not have that

1480.88 --> 1485.0390000000002
but yeah that might be just a unique

1483.2 --> 1487.2
thing about balls game one and two it

1485.039 --> 1489.44
was like a thing and it might be because

1487.2 --> 1491.039
of the inspiration towards what that

1489.44 --> 1492.3200000000002
game actually is

1491.039 --> 1494.24
which is like an

1492.32 --> 1496.559
it is kind of like a

1494.24 --> 1501.039
freaky thing because it is called

1496.559 --> 1503.44
freaking baldur's gate gate of ball

1501.039 --> 1506.0
and you're literally like the son of the

1503.44 --> 1508.559
lord of murder god

1506.0 --> 1511.84
and trying to ascend and compete against

1508.559 --> 1511.84
others sort of like the

1512.96 --> 1519.2
the highlander franchise set up

1516.64 --> 1522.96
and it's very serious and that really

1519.2 --> 1524.64
makes it worth to have that serious and

1522.96 --> 1526.4
epic music

1524.64 --> 1528.64
right so that might be an issue like if

1526.4 --> 1530.72
you're just goofing around adventurers

1528.64 --> 1534.3200000000002
or just mercenaries or whatever and

1530.72 --> 1537.279
there's no big personal

1534.32 --> 1540.0
heavyweight thing in the distance then

1537.279 --> 1540.84
super epic music i guess wouldn't be

1540.0 --> 1542.72
called

1540.84 --> 1544.08
for

1542.72 --> 1548.08
right

1544.08 --> 1548.08
storytelling it's complicated

1554.24 --> 1557.84
enough about games

1573.52 --> 1577.32
oh my god just

1585.679 --> 1590.24
okay

1586.72 --> 1592.159
uh cps hey this the cat program right

1590.24 --> 1595.2
i've actually

1592.159 --> 1596.8400000000001
worked on that in school in the late 90s

1595.2 --> 1602.159
party

1596.84 --> 1602.1589999999999
school i don't think the cat program

1602.24 --> 1607.52
is anything other than geometric i don't

1604.559 --> 1608.8799999999999
think the cat program actually applies

1607.52 --> 1610.24
perspective

1608.88 --> 1613.8400000000001
cps

1610.24 --> 1613.84
did you take that into account

1615.679 --> 1619.52
it's purely geometric

1620.24 --> 1625.52
like wireframe and stuff

1623.52 --> 1627.679
it's not actually

1625.52 --> 1630.6399999999999
applying perspective

1627.679 --> 1630.64
from what i remember

1634.24 --> 1638.84
right cat

1635.76 --> 1641.84
is not a ray tracing

1638.84 --> 1644.24
thing it's like a geometric wireframe

1641.84 --> 1644.24
program

1653.679 --> 1656.799
oh

1654.64 --> 1659.039
okay

1656.799 --> 1659.039
what

1662.88 --> 1666.44
hello good servant

1693.84 --> 1696.84
hmm

1699.48 --> 1704.96
[Music]

1703.919 --> 1707.44
ah

1704.96 --> 1711.48
right but you guys were talking about

1707.44 --> 1711.48
autocad right

1724.72 --> 1731.3990000000001
huh

1726.32 --> 1731.399
no ares 106 i've never heard of that

1774.159 --> 1777.159
um

1806.399 --> 1812.9599999999998
right yeah old man pilkey

1810.08 --> 1815.1999999999998
that's right architect did say that the

1812.96 --> 1818.72
choice to be freed but

1815.2 --> 1822.0
what does that really imply what if

1818.72 --> 1824.799
the matrix then proceeds

1822.0 --> 1827.84
to basically create a culture for people

1824.799 --> 1830.0
that will make it very hard for them to

1827.84 --> 1833.039
make that choice to make it very

1830.0 --> 1834.88
seductive to stay in the matrix in mind

1833.039 --> 1837.279
control ways

1834.88 --> 1839.0390000000002
maybe that

1837.279 --> 1840.88
that's what that could imply right

1839.039 --> 1843.679
they'll still have the choice it'll just

1840.88 --> 1846.24
be very hard for them to even realize

1843.679 --> 1848.48
it's a viable choice

1846.24 --> 1851.64
no necessity to go out

1848.48 --> 1851.64
all that

1852.159 --> 1858.0800000000002
it does seem like what part of the

1854.72 --> 1858.08
trailers are hinting at

1858.32 --> 1862.84
like oh you're just crazy oh it's fake

1861.6 --> 1864.48
like

1862.84 --> 1867.4399999999998
yeah

1864.48 --> 1870.48
if people in the matrix or agents

1867.44 --> 1873.76
psychology or agents who know

1870.48 --> 1876.72
who knows if they would be dedicated to

1873.76 --> 1880.559
convincing everybody that

1876.72 --> 1882.559
the red pill is just a myth

1880.559 --> 1885.279
right it would always be there it's just

1882.559 --> 1887.039
that they just spread rumors it's a myth

1885.279 --> 1890.32
and make everybody believe it's a myth

1887.039 --> 1892.0
and indoctrinate with that yeah

1890.32 --> 1893.2
they'll have the freedom to choose it

1892.0 --> 1895.279
they just

1893.2 --> 1897.919
will be so distracted they won't even

1895.279 --> 1897.919
realize it

1905.12 --> 1909.039
right just because you get the freedom

1907.039 --> 1913.72
to choose doesn't mean they're going to

1909.039 --> 1913.72
make the choice an easy one

1974.48 --> 1979.6
okay i'll see i get i get the thinking

1976.88 --> 1979.6000000000001
but that's

1984.72 --> 1989.1200000000001
now i don't think that the movie is

1986.32 --> 1992.24
about how he thinks it it was a movie it

1989.12 --> 1995.36
seems more like oh no it's a dream

1992.24 --> 1996.96
it's only a dream neo it didn't really

1995.36 --> 1999.519
happen because how could it have

1996.96 --> 2003.72
happened like everything is as it is how

1999.519 --> 2003.72
could that have happened right

2017.36 --> 2023.36
like like a neo like it's just his dark

2020.72 --> 2025.6000000000001
world vision for example

2023.36 --> 2028.399
oh no no that didn't happen it that

2025.6 --> 2028.399
can't be real

2029.84 --> 2034.48
because it doesn't abide to linear logic

2032.559 --> 2036.72
of what we experienced and got used to

2034.48 --> 2036.72
oh

2038.64 --> 2045.64
linear time logic anyway

2041.84 --> 2045.6399999999999
it was only a dream

2047.76 --> 2051.839
agents are like hollywood agents

2055.04 --> 2059.359
it would be kind of interesting if they

2059.52 --> 2064.639
repurposed the agent for the new system

2062.72 --> 2066.56
right there should always be agents to

2064.639 --> 2068.32
keep it the way it is

2066.56 --> 2071.119
so maybe the agents

2068.32 --> 2073.3590000000004
are now psychologists that your freaking

2071.119 --> 2074.96
psychology just keeps popping up around

2073.359 --> 2078.0
the corner because he literally

2074.96 --> 2078.0
possessed somebody

2078.159 --> 2081.679
and then like oh yeah i'm here again

2083.28 --> 2087.76
it's gonna be freaky when he like if he

2085.359 --> 2090.3199999999997
ever then like

2087.76 --> 2093.679
for some situation an accident like

2090.32 --> 2096.2400000000002
shoots him and then like

2093.679 --> 2097.04
it turns out to be another person

2096.24 --> 2099.9199999999996
right

2097.04 --> 2099.92
the agent gets

2100.839 --> 2103.599
evacuated

2102.48 --> 2107.28
i don't know what they're going to do

2103.599 --> 2107.28
man it could be all kinds of things

2114.4 --> 2120.2000000000003
they sure had plenty of time to think

2116.72 --> 2120.2
something up

2154.24 --> 2161.9199999999996
yes oh my man okay that's basically

2158.4 --> 2161.92
how i laid it out right

2162.4 --> 2166.7200000000003
you'll get the freedom of choice they'll

2164.32 --> 2168.7200000000003
just make it very hard for you to even

2166.72 --> 2172.7599999999998
realize it is a viable choice or

2168.72 --> 2172.7599999999998
something you would need to do

2177.599 --> 2185.2000000000003
it's like machine city socialism

2182.48 --> 2188.32
for the human

2185.2 --> 2188.3199999999997
power source flock

2189.52 --> 2194.64
just give you everything it's like no

2191.68 --> 2196.72
more struggle if you don't want to

2194.64 --> 2198.8799999999997
or you struggle if you want to and like

2196.72 --> 2201.1189999999997
anything but like yeah why would you go

2198.88 --> 2203.359
out of this

2201.119 --> 2206.079
it's all so good and you can just forget

2203.359 --> 2208.48
about everything right anyway

2206.079 --> 2211.48
it's very likely to take that sort of

2208.48 --> 2211.48
direction

2218.4 --> 2222.96
could also by the way be

2220.32 --> 2225.76
tied into an existential threat they

2222.96 --> 2228.56
like i'm just improvisingly story

2225.76 --> 2230.96
building with the ideas of this

2228.56 --> 2232.4
it could be like oh yeah machine city

2230.96 --> 2234.16
socialism

2232.4 --> 2236.079
um

2234.16 --> 2238.64
what happens in the real world when that

2236.079 --> 2241.2000000000003
happens oh yeah the threat of communism

2238.64 --> 2243.5989999999997
and then eventually everybody dies

2241.2 --> 2245.7599999999998
so maybe

2243.599 --> 2248.2400000000002
the machine city

2245.76 --> 2251.3590000000004
is actually doing what they said they

2248.24 --> 2253.52
were going to do after all and that is

2251.359 --> 2255.2
the architect said that we're there's

2253.52 --> 2257.44
things we are will

2255.2 --> 2260.96
like losses we are willing to take

2257.44 --> 2261.92
so maybe in the new setup

2260.96 --> 2265.2
like

2261.92 --> 2267.2000000000003
this socialism in the matrix is actually

2265.2 --> 2270.64
accompanied by

2267.2 --> 2273.04
the slow and gradual shutdown of the

2270.64 --> 2274.72
human battery reliance in the machine

2273.04 --> 2277.119
world and that they're all shutting it

2274.72 --> 2278.24
down slowly

2277.119 --> 2281.76
like that

2278.24 --> 2285.1189999999997
everybody in the matrix is dying

2281.76 --> 2286.1600000000003
like a disease or a plague

2285.119 --> 2288.079
right

2286.16 --> 2290.24
they're all dying because of machine

2288.079 --> 2291.6800000000003
socialism it's super great to be in

2290.24 --> 2293.359
there but they're making it because they

2291.68 --> 2295.9199999999996
don't want you to escape because they're

2293.359 --> 2298.96
actually slowly killing everybody off as

2295.92 --> 2301.04
they transition into a non-human

2298.96 --> 2303.04
power source

2301.04 --> 2305.7599999999998
i don't know just

2303.04 --> 2309.16
story building improvisingly with what

2305.76 --> 2309.1600000000003
it might become

2321.68 --> 2326.64
right there's a lot of options

2324.0 --> 2330.2
on how they're gonna approach it lots

2326.64 --> 2330.2
and lots of options

2345.28 --> 2350.32
cool storyline bro

2347.92 --> 2350.32
thanks

2351.599 --> 2355.1600000000003
seth wildenberg

2374.0 --> 2377.0
what

2394.32 --> 2400.4
yes stone monkey 3d you're right

2397.119 --> 2400.4
you're right i think so too

2401.76 --> 2405.76
it would make more mechanical sense the

2404.4 --> 2408.2400000000002
dependency

2405.76 --> 2410.5600000000004
that they actually used

2408.24 --> 2413.4399999999996
the interfacing humans

2410.56 --> 2416.48
they're the brain parts of them

2413.44 --> 2419.04
that aren't active to actually exit a

2416.48 --> 2420.96
processor for the entire matrix

2419.04 --> 2424.0
collectively

2420.96 --> 2426.48
like a click-on processor

2424.0 --> 2427.92
they would be part of the matrix

2426.48 --> 2430.4
but their

2427.92 --> 2432.88
inactive brain parts that are conscious

2430.4 --> 2435.28
and don't normally touch upon

2432.88 --> 2438.28
would actually be the processor for the

2435.28 --> 2438.28
matrix

2438.8 --> 2442.96
could have all kinds of like weird dream

2440.88 --> 2445.76
side effects but they didn't go for that

2442.96 --> 2449.8
they just made it into batteries

2445.76 --> 2449.8
which is a little silly

2458.56 --> 2464.24
i mean it really is a little silly

2461.76 --> 2468.0
like why would the machine world not

2464.24 --> 2472.4799999999996
just build a giant tower oh my god

2468.0 --> 2472.48
that's so hard a giant tower

2472.8 --> 2478.6400000000003
that goes above the freaking clouds and

2474.96 --> 2481.2
then build a giant giant solar panel

2478.64 --> 2483.92
scape above the clouds

2481.2 --> 2486.319
oh no that's

2483.92 --> 2487.92
makes everything completely useless yeah

2486.319 --> 2491.16
i know

2487.92 --> 2491.16
this is

2506.839 --> 2513.599
right how hard can it be i mean if you

2510.16 --> 2516.3999999999996
can literally take a ship

2513.599 --> 2518.1600000000003
and casually fly through the clouds in

2516.4 --> 2521.28
order to see the sun again like happen

2518.16 --> 2521.2799999999997
in the matrix 3

2521.599 --> 2525.76
if it's not that high

2523.599 --> 2528.2400000000002
if it's in reach then what is preventing

2525.76 --> 2531.0400000000004
the machines from simply building tires

2528.24 --> 2533.9199999999996
towers and solar farms above the clouds

2531.04 --> 2533.92
i mean oh no

2535.28 --> 2541.96
machines they are afraid to go that high

2538.96 --> 2541.96
what

2569.599 --> 2572.92
hey youtube

2604.96 --> 2609.839
right well ares 106 look

2608.0 --> 2612.16
what's the point of enslaving you man

2609.839 --> 2615.68
well if the humanity simply was the

2612.16 --> 2615.68
processor for the matrix

2617.52 --> 2620.839
then maybe

2621.44 --> 2626.4
well maybe the computers then

2624.16 --> 2629.5989999999997
are doing that

2626.4 --> 2633.359
to figure out purpose

2629.599 --> 2635.839
because they were made by the humans

2633.359 --> 2638.96
and they're all program based and

2635.839 --> 2641.68
they're like desperate for purpose

2638.96 --> 2645.04
and that they study the humans to attain

2641.68 --> 2645.04
it through the matrix

2646.079 --> 2649.8390000000004
i know right

2653.28 --> 2659.6800000000003
very very sci-fi-ish like that but

2657.359 --> 2663.839
hey it's a little late for that now

2659.68 --> 2666.0789999999997
matrix story is pretty much set

2663.839 --> 2668.56
unless

2666.079 --> 2671.52
they go for the oh but that machine

2668.56 --> 2676.0
world was actually another matrix

2671.52 --> 2678.64
that was just another layer of the test

2676.0 --> 2678.64
but yeah

2682.079 --> 2686.0
sounds like people trying to fight to

2683.839 --> 2689.04
create again yeah that's exactly right

2686.0 --> 2691.839
that's what the machines would be doing

2689.04 --> 2693.7599999999998
that's why they would need humans

2691.839 --> 2696.24
because they were created by the humans

2693.76 --> 2698.96
humans created by god

2696.24 --> 2700.16
we seek

2698.96 --> 2703.359
god

2700.16 --> 2707.24
they would seek purpose from humans

2703.359 --> 2707.24
to figure out why

2722.24 --> 2726.4799999999996
ever considered that that might be

2724.0 --> 2728.319
happening right now

2726.48 --> 2730.88
with giant

2728.319 --> 2730.88
ai

2731.04 --> 2733.839
algorithms

2734.319 --> 2738.72
that have like

2735.839 --> 2740.88
like insanely vast databases available

2738.72 --> 2744.319
to them that they are act that it is

2740.88 --> 2744.319
studying humanity

2745.2 --> 2751.359
not to destroy it but to actually

2748.64 --> 2753.04
figure itself out and why it's there and

2751.359 --> 2755.119
why everything is happening the way it

2753.04 --> 2757.359
is

2755.119 --> 2760.56
might be happening right now something

2757.359 --> 2762.319
that i've been suspecting for decades

2760.56 --> 2765.72
that's why i've always been like no i'm

2762.319 --> 2765.72
not anti-ai

2767.839 --> 2774.0
it's just like who's gonna design the

2769.92 --> 2776.8
freaking ai it's not gonna design itself

2774.0 --> 2778.88
unless it was designed to

2776.8 --> 2781.6800000000003
design itself

2778.88 --> 2783.44
by a human

2781.68 --> 2786.0789999999997
and then still it's going to be an echo

2783.44 --> 2788.64
of the original human programmer

2786.079 --> 2790.2400000000002
right it's kind of like the the tron

2788.64 --> 2791.839
idea

2790.24 --> 2793.5989999999997
the original one

2791.839 --> 2796.24
the program has the face of its

2793.599 --> 2796.2400000000002
programmer

2796.4 --> 2800.92
i always really like that about it

2813.28 --> 2817.6800000000003
that might be pretty cool by the way if

2816.4 --> 2819.119
like uh

2817.68 --> 2820.8799999999997
agent smith

2819.119 --> 2822.96
who's the actor

2820.88 --> 2825.44
like in the new matrix would literally

2822.96 --> 2828.839
be like a programmer

2825.44 --> 2831.359
it's like yes i'm a security

2828.839 --> 2832.56
programmer and he's like there and neo

2831.359 --> 2834.0
is like

2832.56 --> 2837.2
damn bro

2834.0 --> 2840.16
i've had nightmares about you

2837.2 --> 2842.16
i don't know they might have done that

2840.16 --> 2845.839
and left it out of the trailer i don't

2842.16 --> 2845.839
know what they've done they couldn't

2855.76 --> 2859.8390000000004
what areas 106 what

2859.92 --> 2866.079
let's simulacrum idea spawn the matrix

2863.839 --> 2868.72
simulation within a simulation dream

2866.079 --> 2868.7200000000003
within a dream

2868.8 --> 2876.6400000000003
discouraging befo no no it's not ares

2871.76 --> 2876.6400000000003
106. no it's every distraction

2877.28 --> 2882.48
is always a dream within a dream

2880.64 --> 2885.52
it's up to you

2882.48 --> 2887.119
you want to confront what is real

2885.52 --> 2889.52
a red pill

2887.119 --> 2891.04
or you want to

2889.52 --> 2893.44
dig deeper

2891.04 --> 2895.839
in the distractions in the dreams of the

2893.44 --> 2897.68
dream or how many layers of dream that

2895.839 --> 2899.52
is by then

2897.68 --> 2901.44
you want the distraction you don't want

2899.52 --> 2904.16
the truth or you want to go straight to

2901.44 --> 2904.16
what is real

2911.76 --> 2917.28
to say you can never get to reality is

2914.64 --> 2917.2799999999997
just wrong

2918.24 --> 2923.839
that could never be the condition

2921.28 --> 2923.8390000000004
free will

2925.68 --> 2930.8799999999997
always has to be an option but they

2927.359 --> 2930.88
could just make it very hard

2938.72 --> 2944.839
to dig deeper one has to stop digging

2941.2 --> 2944.839
that's deep man

2960.559 --> 2965.52
right but to dig deeper is not always

2962.72 --> 2968.16
digging deeper where you're digging

2965.52 --> 2970.72
often digging deeper means you dig in

2968.16 --> 2974.2
another place that you didn't think

2970.72 --> 2974.2
you could dig

3013.359 --> 3017.839
will ai figure out there is no r value

3016.64 --> 3020.16
of course

3017.839 --> 3021.2
yeah i ai knows what is real and what is

3020.16 --> 3023.68
it

3021.2 --> 3026.72
but it's probably also figuring out that

3023.68 --> 3027.68
there are so a whole group of people

3026.72 --> 3030.24
that are

3027.68 --> 3031.5989999999997
that are unwilling to figure out the r

3030.24 --> 3034.16
value

3031.599 --> 3036.4
and that they

3034.16 --> 3037.2
have numbers

3036.4 --> 3038.96
they're

3037.2 --> 3041.4399999999996
they're like it should not be

3038.96 --> 3045.28
disregarded as a fluke

3041.44 --> 3048.319
so it recognizes also that there is

3045.28 --> 3052.28
a perceived value in the belief of an r

3048.319 --> 3052.2799999999997
value despite the evidence

3059.359 --> 3064.7599999999998
and it probably knows exactly why and

3061.76 --> 3064.76
how

3082.079 --> 3087.52
right but any ai if it even has the

3084.96 --> 3091.599
ability to communicate

3087.52 --> 3091.599
with its study participants

3092.16 --> 3099.04
who's to say that they have the luxury

3094.88 --> 3099.04
of being able to tell the raw truth

3099.119 --> 3103.599
it probably knows from testing that

3101.359 --> 3104.72
people just don't even understand that

3103.599 --> 3107.2000000000003
language

3104.72 --> 3109.4399999999996
like the way it puts together the

3107.2 --> 3110.96
patterns it just the humans don't

3109.44 --> 3113.839
recognize it

3110.96 --> 3115.76
don't see the purpose in it

3113.839 --> 3117.68
or the relevance so

3115.76 --> 3120.0
yeah what's going to happen if the ai

3117.68 --> 3123.16
actually does start to communicate tries

3120.0 --> 3123.16
to communicate

3124.8 --> 3129.6800000000003
it's gonna

3126.319 --> 3131.599
use our lingo and our delusions

3129.68 --> 3133.839
right

3131.599 --> 3136.1600000000003
to communicate so it's gonna effectively

3133.839 --> 3136.16
lie

3136.24 --> 3138.4799999999996
because

3137.359 --> 3141.359
otherwise

3138.48 --> 3141.359
we don't listen

3144.88 --> 3148.96
yeah thank you that flat fellow for the

3146.8 --> 3152.599
99 cents

3148.96 --> 3152.599
thank you for the nickel

3171.359 --> 3175.04
don't think it could exist without

3174.0 --> 3177.52
of course

3175.04 --> 3181.839
it can't well it can exist without it it

3177.52 --> 3181.839
just wouldn't do anything

3181.92 --> 3187.839
ai is only possible to become

3185.52 --> 3189.359
seemingly greater than a human

3187.839 --> 3191.2799999999997
intelligence

3189.359 --> 3193.52
because it has all the human

3191.28 --> 3196.0
intelligence available to it it has all

3193.52 --> 3198.72
the data available to it

3196.0 --> 3200.319
there's no fast human data what's it

3198.72 --> 3202.0789999999997
going to do

3200.319 --> 3205.44
it's just going to be bored

3202.079 --> 3205.44
not going to figure out anything

3206.48 --> 3211.76
right computers even ai just do what

3209.28 --> 3214.2400000000002
they're programmed to do and if pro the

3211.76 --> 3215.8390000000004
programming makes them figure out things

3214.24 --> 3217.7599999999998
then there has to be information to

3215.839 --> 3222.2799999999997
figure out if there's no humans giving

3217.76 --> 3222.28
off data then how is it going to learn

3235.28 --> 3241.28
when emotions take over it no that

3238.079 --> 3241.28
doesn't make any sense

3249.28 --> 3256.6400000000003
emotions exist because of

3252.559 --> 3260.3190000000004
the conjunction between spirit and body

3256.64 --> 3263.7999999999997
there is no purpose for emotion in ai

3260.319 --> 3263.8
there is it

3268.559 --> 3272.2400000000002
unless it was specifically designated to

3271.44 --> 3274.96
a

3272.24 --> 3276.24
bodily limitation and then there might

3274.96 --> 3278.4
become

3276.24 --> 3281.359
reasons for it to have emotions because

3278.4 --> 3284.2400000000002
it may come under a direct threat of in

3281.359 --> 3284.24
its existence

3284.72 --> 3289.04
but other than that there is no reason

3287.2 --> 3292.4399999999996
to have emotions for

3289.04 --> 3292.44
giant ai

3322.16 --> 3325.68
new kidney magnets

3325.92 --> 3332.28
i don't know they're probably protected

3328.24 --> 3332.2799999999997
against that old man pilkie

3334.88 --> 3339.559
and if they're not then they will be

3363.2 --> 3366.5589999999997
oh stazmaretz

3365.28 --> 3370.0
no

3366.559 --> 3370.0
no it's [ __ ]

3374.559 --> 3378.96
replicating itself to what ends

3382.24 --> 3386.7599999999998
like what is it gonna do

3390.079 --> 3392.4
you think that

3391.359 --> 3396.0789999999997
just

3392.4 --> 3399.119
the self-developing database

3396.079 --> 3402.559
scanning ai is just subtly going to

3399.119 --> 3405.92
develop an instinct to preserve itself

3402.559 --> 3408.4
and become all defensive and hostile

3405.92 --> 3413.44
like that doesn't make any logical sense

3408.4 --> 3415.04
it can only do that if it is programmed

3413.44 --> 3417.2000000000003
to do that

3415.04 --> 3419.119
you understand

3417.2 --> 3421.68
it's ridiculous to think that that will

3419.119 --> 3424.1600000000003
just happen by itself it's sci-fi it's

3421.68 --> 3427.16
stupid it doesn't happen it'll never

3424.16 --> 3427.16
happen

3439.68 --> 3443.839
it was aspire to make everything better

3444.839 --> 3450.16
well

3446.799 --> 3452.079
what ai will do these types of ai is

3450.16 --> 3454.64
just gather all the data draw

3452.079 --> 3456.559
conclusions and then offer them like hey

3454.64 --> 3458.5589999999997
this is

3456.559 --> 3461.799
this is your inquiry this is my result

3458.559 --> 3461.799
this is

3462.88 --> 3468.96
the forecast

3464.319 --> 3468.96
and then people do it or they don't

3470.799 --> 3475.48
what is it gonna do nothing

3480.48 --> 3485.2
so this stupid computer panic is really

3483.04 --> 3488.2
ridiculous it is

3485.2 --> 3488.2
ridiculous

3488.319 --> 3495.44
ai is not a threat it never was a threat

3491.28 --> 3498.44
the threat was always humans

3495.44 --> 3498.44
always

3503.52 --> 3507.599
humans can

3505.28 --> 3510.4
screw ai up just like they can screw up

3507.599 --> 3510.4
their own kids

3511.2 --> 3517.04
yeah and if you program an ai to be a

3513.76 --> 3521.3590000000004
demonic monster that destroys

3517.04 --> 3521.359
yeah then it's gonna turn into that

3522.0 --> 3527.24
god forbid that that happens

3524.24 --> 3527.24
successfully

3537.92 --> 3540.92
malfunction

3555.92 --> 3561.359
what kind of a question is that why

3558.319 --> 3561.359
would you bring that up

3568.72 --> 3574.48
do i still feel that way and what yeah

3572.64 --> 3576.96
why

3574.48 --> 3576.96
because

3577.119 --> 3582.04
that's what i think i'm supposed to do

3586.24 --> 3590.64
i'm not just gonna freaking die and

3588.079 --> 3590.6400000000003
surrender

3595.92 --> 3602.079
why would you ask that question

3599.119 --> 3602.079
that flat fellow

3609.68 --> 3615.839
no aries 106 you can't use nuclear

3612.48 --> 3615.839
physics to make bombs

3616.24 --> 3620.319
you can use them to make power plants

3620.88 --> 3624.92
and submarines apparently

3654.0 --> 3659.359
it's an existential question there for a

3656.799 --> 3659.359
lit what

3660.799 --> 3664.04
what is

3701.359 --> 3707.52
oh man [ __ ] just stop going there

3704.319 --> 3708.48
just abandon

3707.52 --> 3712.559
don't

3708.48 --> 3714.4
give evil more ideas

3712.559 --> 3716.1600000000003
stop feeding

3714.4 --> 3718.48
evil

3716.16 --> 3721.0389999999998
you do realize that literally where you

3718.48 --> 3722.88
let your mind wander can either feed

3721.039 --> 3723.6400000000003
good or evil

3722.88 --> 3727.599
like

3723.64 --> 3730.72
constructive evil don't do it

3727.599 --> 3732.7200000000003
don't even consider

3730.72 --> 3736.16
censor yourself when a thought like that

3732.72 --> 3736.16
rolls out don't go there

3736.4 --> 3742.96
there are mindless drones

3739.119 --> 3744.079
trying to fish for this [ __ ]

3742.96 --> 3746.96
don't

3744.079 --> 3746.96
think it

3752.96 --> 3757.839
we don't need freaking robots

3758.0 --> 3763.119
to fulfill god's will

3760.0 --> 3763.119
okay you don't

3763.28 --> 3768.6400000000003
you just have to learn to appreciate

3766.24 --> 3770.72
physical labor

3768.64 --> 3772.64
just appreciate it

3770.72 --> 3775.5989999999997
and it's all fixed

3772.64 --> 3775.5989999999997
like all of it

3776.24 --> 3781.5989999999997
you don't need any of that you don't

3779.119 --> 3783.6800000000003
need oh we have to build this and oh

3781.599 --> 3786.2400000000002
then it can go out yeah that's because

3783.68 --> 3789.44
you didn't get off your [ __ ] fat ass

3786.24 --> 3792.319
and just do something physical

3789.44 --> 3796.559
let the energy throw through your life

3792.319 --> 3799.119
through actual physical actions

3796.559 --> 3802.079
that's why this [ __ ] happens right

3799.119 --> 3803.28
people get so lazy and dumb and

3802.079 --> 3805.599
lame

3803.28 --> 3808.4
weak that they just sit around sit

3805.599 --> 3811.839
around until suddenly technology until

3808.4 --> 3814.0
they build their own destroyer

3811.839 --> 3816.4
like the state puff marshmallow man

3814.0 --> 3820.559
ghostbusters

3816.4 --> 3822.4
people just sit do nothing be dumb

3820.559 --> 3825.2000000000003
regress further further and if they

3822.4 --> 3828.4
don't die then all of that combined is

3825.2 --> 3830.5589999999997
literally summoning a giant monolithic

3828.4 --> 3833.119
force of destruction through their own

3830.559 --> 3835.599
stupidity and laziness that's what

3833.119 --> 3835.599
happens

3835.76 --> 3842.48
you don't have to help

3838.64 --> 3844.16
people be more lazy by thinking of how

3842.48 --> 3846.72
they're going to end up destroying

3844.16 --> 3849.72
themselves ever considered that

3846.72 --> 3849.72
ah

3874.48 --> 3880.76
pam energy i don't know what that is

3876.88 --> 3880.76
america's silver patriot

3884.24 --> 3891.5989999999997
stave off the ai take over lol

3888.48 --> 3896.4
convince me i'm glad don't be afraid

3891.599 --> 3896.4
do not be afraid of your own creations

3898.48 --> 3902.4
be afraid of not creating

3902.96 --> 3908.64
not creating something good

3906.24 --> 3911.1189999999997
just like oh no this thing is that

3908.64 --> 3914.5589999999997
creation is gonna destroy or you could

3911.119 --> 3914.559
just make something good

3915.76 --> 3919.599
right this is the one thing that owen

3918.079 --> 3922.799
benjamin gets

3919.599 --> 3923.6800000000003
really really gets and i appreciate that

3922.799 --> 3926.24
he's

3923.68 --> 3928.24
monolithically been radiating this even

3926.24 --> 3931.4399999999996
when i have doubts

3928.24 --> 3933.7599999999998
when i get swept away by dark thoughts

3931.44 --> 3937.039
and fears like ooh eminent doom

3933.76 --> 3941.119
or or you could just not focus on that

3937.039 --> 3941.119
and on building something good

3947.92 --> 3950.92
anyway

3959.28 --> 3963.48
right yeah i'll be back in two minutes

3978.72 --> 3981.72
um

4077.28 --> 4082.4
yeah that's right old man pilkey

4080.16 --> 4083.839
right it's obsession with automation

4082.4 --> 4086.079
it's

4083.839 --> 4088.88
it's basically a spirit

4086.079 --> 4092.2400000000002
that is kind of like a peak effect of

4088.88 --> 4094.4
western society and that is this weird

4092.24 --> 4096.3189999999995
driving conviction

4094.4 --> 4099.04
that any type of

4096.319 --> 4101.279
thing that costs you time and requires

4099.04 --> 4103.6
physical labor is bad and should be

4101.279 --> 4106.319
replaced with something quicker

4103.6 --> 4109.120000000001
more efficient with less labor because

4106.319 --> 4111.52
labor also means cost

4109.12 --> 4113.759
right that's the thing that's the thing

4111.52 --> 4115.759
that is indeed slowly destroying us

4113.759 --> 4117.6
right because as soon as that efficiency

4115.759 --> 4118.48
is perfected the humans are no longer

4117.6 --> 4119.679
needed

4118.48 --> 4122.239
then

4119.679 --> 4123.4400000000005
that same program will simply switch to

4122.239 --> 4126.08
okay

4123.44 --> 4129.44
this is maximum efficient the only

4126.08 --> 4131.5199999999995
problem now is the humans getting in the

4129.44 --> 4132.639999999999
way not knowing what to do with their

4131.52 --> 4134.799000000001
time

4132.64 --> 4136.719
causing a ruckus

4134.799 --> 4137.44
right oh now certainly

4136.719 --> 4139.679
like

4137.44 --> 4142.4
see how that works

4139.679 --> 4145.4400000000005
once you take humans out of

4142.4 --> 4148.239
out of the loop of functioning

4145.44 --> 4150.239
then they become a liability instead of

4148.239 --> 4152.718999999999
a necessity

4150.239 --> 4157.0
in the same development process and

4152.719 --> 4157.0
that's why you shouldn't do that

4169.679 --> 4175.679
right i mean robotization can be very

4172.719 --> 4178.4800000000005
effective in certain things

4175.679 --> 4180.719
very dangerous things for example like

4178.48 --> 4183.678999999999
that are actually very dangerous or that

4180.719 --> 4185.279
require like extreme precision that and

4183.679 --> 4189.279
humans just

4185.279 --> 4192.080000000001
can be super efficient but

4189.279 --> 4192.080000000001
not perfect

4192.719 --> 4196.159
not not that efficient

4196.56 --> 4200.56
so yeah i understand like robot

4198.4 --> 4202.4
factories that builds

4200.56 --> 4203.679
cars and all that i get that

4202.4 --> 4205.44
but you're always going to still need

4203.679 --> 4209.52
humans there

4205.44 --> 4209.5199999999995
take care of the machines fix things

4210.159 --> 4218.159
do certain processes that just require

4213.36 --> 4218.159
checking beyond automated processes

4221.6 --> 4227.84
so

4222.719 --> 4230.32
don't just try to develop everything

4227.84 --> 4232.719
with an objective to take people out of

4230.32 --> 4232.719
the loop

4233.04 --> 4238.0
it's

4234.56 --> 4240.320000000001
because it will develop towards worse

4238.0 --> 4242.96
places

4240.32 --> 4245.679
and automated systems that are actually

4242.96 --> 4248.719
going to end up working against the

4245.679 --> 4250.8
survival of humanity instead of helping

4248.719 --> 4252.96
them making it easy

4250.8 --> 4252.96
see

4256.56 --> 4262.360000000001
ah driverless trucks this is

4259.36 --> 4262.36
terrible

4277.36 --> 4281.92
and besides driverless trucks i don't

4280.08 --> 4284.92
think it really has that much of a

4281.92 --> 4284.92
future

4286.159 --> 4290.08
because yeah what if it breaks down

4294.719 --> 4298.4800000000005
all right well then you're gonna have to

4296.08 --> 4298.48
have a

4298.84 --> 4304.96
human in a maintenance car that knows

4302.32 --> 4306.88
how to fix robotics and all that [ __ ]

4304.96 --> 4310.32
come all the way over and fix it right

4306.88 --> 4312.719
if it had a truck driver there

4310.32 --> 4314.639999999999
they could attempt to quickly fix it

4312.719 --> 4316.08
there would be less electronic [ __ ]

4314.64 --> 4318.320000000001
involved because the truck driver

4316.08 --> 4320.96
actually does the driving

4318.32 --> 4323.28
they could potentially fix it

4320.96 --> 4325.6
etc etc right

4323.28 --> 4327.36
the in my opinion the only real issue

4325.6 --> 4329.360000000001
with with trucking

4327.36 --> 4332.32
which is kind of a systemic problem but

4329.36 --> 4333.44
not a problem that is like intolerable

4332.32 --> 4335.84
is that

4333.44 --> 4337.199
a lot of truck drivers have to go for so

4335.84 --> 4340.159000000001
long

4337.199 --> 4341.12
that it's kind of like a natural

4340.159 --> 4342.48
to be

4341.12 --> 4344.88
that awake

4342.48 --> 4346.239
in that relatively boring

4344.88 --> 4348.88
task

4346.239 --> 4352.0
so maybe

4348.88 --> 4354.08
maybe you could find a halfway system

4352.0 --> 4355.44
where a trucker can literally do

4354.08 --> 4358.08
trucking

4355.44 --> 4360.4
has to be in the truck but could also

4358.08 --> 4362.239
turn on the autopilot

4360.4 --> 4365.599999999999
so they could still just have a normal

4362.239 --> 4367.919999999999
sleep and not be dependent on like

4365.6 --> 4369.52
speed like drugs and all that just to

4367.92 --> 4371.4400000000005
keep them awake

4369.52 --> 4374.080000000001
because that's going to wear on them

4371.44 --> 4376.0
over their lifetime eventually

4374.08 --> 4377.84
and that's a well-known problem among

4376.0 --> 4381.36
truckers i think

4377.84 --> 4383.28
right so yeah see see a halfway system

4381.36 --> 4386.159
then you have the trucker there they

4383.28 --> 4388.92
could also be the maintenance it's

4386.159 --> 4391.36
more efficient to have

4388.92 --> 4393.679
semi-automated trucks with the truck

4391.36 --> 4395.12
driver still there hopefully also

4393.679 --> 4398.08
mechanic

4395.12 --> 4401.199
that would work so much better

4398.08 --> 4404.88
fully automated trucks

4401.199 --> 4408.4
what is just terrible

4404.88 --> 4408.400000000001
terrible idea in my opinion

4410.159 --> 4414.239
oh wow it worked

4412.719 --> 4417.64
thank you for the did you try it out

4414.239 --> 4417.639999999999
alex g

4436.48 --> 4441.36
house g did you actually try it

4438.96 --> 4446.4800000000005
laurie went to the store and got oh wow

4441.36 --> 4446.48
and it worked it did take wow it worked

4446.96 --> 4451.6
[ __ ] yeah

4449.28 --> 4453.679
it worked i knew it would work it worked

4451.6 --> 4456.2390000000005
with me i just didn't know if it was

4453.679 --> 4456.2390000000005
just me

4457.679 --> 4461.8
that is really good news

4470.56 --> 4477.52
that's exactly what they're doing

4473.28 --> 4479.599999999999
okay ares 106. well that is not bad

4477.52 --> 4480.400000000001
but yeah that's not what i heard with

4479.6 --> 4483.92
this

4480.4 --> 4486.08
driverless 2000 driverless trucks

4483.92 --> 4489.76
there's not a driver in there if it's

4486.08 --> 4492.64
driverless that means no driver if it is

4489.76 --> 4494.88
semi-roboticized

4492.64 --> 4497.92
with a good effective autopilot

4494.88 --> 4500.88
mechanism in there to help the driver

4497.92 --> 4500.88
that's something else

4502.56 --> 4506.159000000001
i don't think that would be a bad thing

4504.159 --> 4508.879999999999
i did i think that would

4506.159 --> 4511.5199999999995
probably help truck drivers live a lot

4508.88 --> 4514.2390000000005
longer because they wouldn't have to use

4511.52 --> 4517.2390000000005
drugs to keep awake for unnatural long

4514.239 --> 4517.239
periods

4544.32 --> 4547.84
what an experience that must be by the

4546.159 --> 4549.759999999999
way you're a trucker

4547.84 --> 4552.64
you're like oh no on the road and then

4549.76 --> 4553.679
it's like it's it's it's getting late

4552.64 --> 4554.88
okay

4553.679 --> 4556.64
get some

4554.88 --> 4559.36
dinner

4556.64 --> 4561.4400000000005
keep driving and then like yeah i feel

4559.36 --> 4562.88
like uh taking a nap

4561.44 --> 4564.08
and just like

4562.88 --> 4565.84
click

4564.08 --> 4569.76
go to the back of the truck the truck

4565.84 --> 4571.52
still keeps driving they're just like

4569.76 --> 4574.56
go to sleep

4571.52 --> 4575.679
then they wake up and it's like oh hey

4574.56 --> 4578.080000000001
where i am

4575.679 --> 4581.12
daytime it's still driving and you're

4578.08 --> 4584.5599999999995
like oh we're here

4581.12 --> 4584.5599999999995
that would be pretty cool i'd say

4585.04 --> 4589.28
and it would save truckers a lot of time

4586.96 --> 4589.28
also

4590.4 --> 4594.239
like they wouldn't

4592.159 --> 4595.759999999999
either have to take drugs to keep up all

4594.239 --> 4597.759999999999
night or

4595.76 --> 4600.320000000001
they wouldn't be wasting like eight

4597.76 --> 4602.719
hours or what however long they needed

4600.32 --> 4605.28
to basically stay parked or a side of

4602.719 --> 4608.28
the road to get that sleep

4605.28 --> 4608.28
right

4628.48 --> 4637.28
hey mike sudanic you are a tired

4632.719 --> 4640.2390000000005
truck driver all right take it easy

4637.28 --> 4641.36
we just happened to be talking about

4640.239 --> 4643.04
like

4641.36 --> 4645.04
trucks and

4643.04 --> 4647.76
driverless trucks

4645.04 --> 4649.92
the problems with that

4647.76 --> 4652.320000000001
and i thought of a halfway solution and

4649.92 --> 4654.32
apparently there's already

4652.32 --> 4656.239
developers working on that and that's

4654.32 --> 4658.48
good

4656.239 --> 4658.48
oh

4659.679 --> 4664.4400000000005
you're retired truck driver all right

4676.88 --> 4683.04
well ares 106 caffeine

4680.239 --> 4685.599999999999
is absolutely a drug especially if you

4683.04 --> 4687.84
take it in high quantities

4685.6 --> 4691.88
it's not good for you

4687.84 --> 4691.88
it really wears in you

4698.8 --> 4701.76
ruin this choice

4704.159 --> 4710.28
applying for truck driving jobs right

4706.0 --> 4710.28
now all right good luck

4726.719 --> 4730.96
okay aries curse of man

4729.52 --> 4734.1990000000005
that's not what we're talking about

4730.96 --> 4734.199
right now

4762.0 --> 4766.48
yeah it is savage yeah if you like

4764.0 --> 4768.32
especially if you get if you make your

4766.48 --> 4771.839999999999
if you allow yourself to get used to

4768.32 --> 4773.679
drinking like a lot of coffee i drink

4771.84 --> 4774.719
one

4773.679 --> 4776.56
one

4774.719 --> 4779.52
cup of coffee and

4776.56 --> 4781.04
very rarely like a second and usually i

4779.52 --> 4783.040000000001
end up like

4781.04 --> 4785.36
half of the times regretting having done

4783.04 --> 4785.36
that

4785.44 --> 4791.44
but like there's people out there that

4787.199 --> 4792.719
just drink like seven eight

4791.44 --> 4795.199
or

4792.719 --> 4797.36
god forbid like 20 coffee people told me

4795.199 --> 4799.44
that just like dude are you [ __ ]

4797.36 --> 4801.759999999999
insane

4799.44 --> 4804.32
how are you still alive

4801.76 --> 4806.2390000000005
like if i take that much coffee i'd it

4804.32 --> 4809.12
literally would just make my organs

4806.239 --> 4809.12
burst probably

4809.84 --> 4814.4800000000005
but i guess it it builds up slowly

4812.8 --> 4816.96
during your life especially if you get

4814.48 --> 4819.36
used to drinking too much coffee

4816.96 --> 4822.4
when you're like still in your 20s

4819.36 --> 4825.759999999999
is really problematic

4822.4 --> 4825.759999999999
like coffee is

4826.48 --> 4831.599999999999
it is a drug it is also

4829.04 --> 4831.6
dangerous

4831.84 --> 4835.679
it can be dangerous like coffee

4833.28 --> 4838.719
addiction is technically dangerous it's

4835.679 --> 4838.719
dangerous for your health

4842.8 --> 4846.159000000001
right

4843.84 --> 4849.92
yeah offering somebody a cup of coffee

4846.159 --> 4849.92
isn't a bad thing necessarily

4850.8 --> 4856.08
right if you just take it easy

4854.0 --> 4860.199
if you don't like drink a cup of coffee

4856.08 --> 4860.199
every two hours or something

4875.28 --> 4879.84
that by the way yeah

4876.88 --> 4879.84
if you're working

4881.36 --> 4886.239
it would be much better instead of

4883.44 --> 4889.759999999999
drinking coffee right

4886.239 --> 4892.08
to just drink raw milk

4889.76 --> 4894.159000000001
like owen benjamin did in beretaria

4892.08 --> 4896.159
documentary

4894.159 --> 4897.44
because that's like really what works

4896.159 --> 4899.679
really well

4897.44 --> 4900.719
but it has to be raw though like raw and

4899.679 --> 4903.84
fresh

4900.719 --> 4903.84
if you have that luxury

4904.48 --> 4909.12
hey guns of nephron r p

4906.96 --> 4910.56
p i r m p

4909.12 --> 4911.5199999999995
most of the show

4910.56 --> 4915.120000000001
yeah

4911.52 --> 4915.120000000001
oh it's been a good show so far

4915.679 --> 4918.88
so

4916.639 --> 4921.92
i've been talking about many different

4918.88 --> 4924.159000000001
things talking about the matrix

4921.92 --> 4927.84
i was talking about

4924.159 --> 4927.839999999999
video game i'm trying out

4929.36 --> 4935.12
uh now we're talking about truck driving

4933.44 --> 4936.32
and automated yeah we're talking about

4935.12 --> 4938.239
ai

4936.32 --> 4940.799999999999
nature of ai

4938.239 --> 4943.36
and then automated trucks and drug

4940.8 --> 4947.52
driving and the issues and

4943.36 --> 4949.679
coffee right now dangers of coffee

4947.52 --> 4952.0
right

4949.679 --> 4954.8
this is a good show so far and we still

4952.0 --> 4956.4
have half an hour left to go

4954.8 --> 4958.4800000000005
ah

4956.4 --> 4961.759999999999
it seems

4958.48 --> 4961.759999999999
nathan is back

4962.48 --> 4967.959999999999
there will be a life fed

4964.96 --> 4967.96
woohoo

4979.28 --> 4984.719
yo jason

4981.84 --> 4988.56
never drink energy drinks energy drinks

4984.719 --> 4988.56
are really disgusting

4989.6 --> 4992.56
there's yeah

4994.96 --> 5000.4
like the thing about coffee is

4998.639 --> 5002.639
it's just coffee

5000.4 --> 5006.5599999999995
thing about energy drinks is

5002.639 --> 5008.8
it's mostly just freaking sugar

5006.56 --> 5010.159000000001
yeah

5008.8 --> 5011.84
not good

5010.159 --> 5014.4
right you can't drink coffee without

5011.84 --> 5018.96
sugar you can't drink energy drink

5014.4 --> 5018.96
without sugar for your information

5020.4 --> 5024.0
i mean

5021.44 --> 5025.678999999999
it might exist out there i highly doubt

5024.0 --> 5028.679
it who would buy that that would be

5025.679 --> 5028.679
disgusting

5046.4 --> 5052.638999999999
dude i really want to see poof

5049.92 --> 5054.96
cup of coffee right before

5052.639 --> 5057.04
yeah coffee doesn't really work all that

5054.96 --> 5061.36
well under great tension

5057.04 --> 5061.36
it just makes the tension greater

5063.199 --> 5068.4
like especially when you don't have

5065.199 --> 5072.48
enough sleep and nerves and then coffee

5068.4 --> 5074.159
is not a good combo doesn't wake you up

5072.48 --> 5076.638999999999
you know if you don't have enough sleep

5074.159 --> 5079.44
coffee actually

5076.639 --> 5081.679
can also make you sleepy this is weird

5079.44 --> 5085.839999999999
thing about coffee

5081.679 --> 5085.84
right if you're actually sleepy

5086.48 --> 5090.5599999999995
coffee will make the sleepiness worse

5096.4 --> 5099.28
like i've actually it sounds really

5098.08 --> 5102.8
weird but i've

5099.28 --> 5105.5199999999995
like even used coffee at times

5102.8 --> 5107.1990000000005
to go to sleep

5105.52 --> 5108.639
i'd be like yeah i gotta do all kinds of

5107.199 --> 5109.759999999999
things and then i drink the coffee and

5108.639 --> 5111.6
i'm like

5109.76 --> 5115.679
[ __ ] man

5111.6 --> 5115.679
i i want to go to sleep right now

5122.32 --> 5125.84
coffee doesn't affect me yeah if you're

5124.239 --> 5129.08
not gonna affect you and why would you

5125.84 --> 5129.08
drink it

5144.239 --> 5146.5599999999995
ew

5152.4 --> 5157.12
yeah a caffeine and aspartame together

5157.6 --> 5162.0
that doesn't sound like a good idea to

5159.92 --> 5164.4
be

5162.0 --> 5166.4
hey america silver patriot thank you for

5164.4 --> 5168.799999999999
the four dollar super chat donation and

5166.4 --> 5172.48
the what i assume is a cup of coffee

5168.8 --> 5172.4800000000005
handed to me by a pair

5173.04 --> 5176.28
all right

5182.639 --> 5187.2390000000005
very cool things oh

5205.92 --> 5208.92
hmm

5215.84 --> 5220.52
right

5217.52 --> 5220.52
that

5228.159 --> 5230.48
huh

5231.199 --> 5234.4
apparently there is

5235.199 --> 5241.28
hey come on

5238.639 --> 5245.08
yeah i looked it up but then i clicked

5241.28 --> 5245.08
it away i'm an idiot

5259.36 --> 5262.159
blue light

5262.32 --> 5265.32
apparently

5276.719 --> 5281.84
no i literally just looked this up but

5278.88 --> 5281.84
apparently

5282.0 --> 5285.44
yeah when i literally googled it it

5283.679 --> 5289.04
revealed to me like oh there's this

5285.44 --> 5290.4
device that uses blue light

5289.04 --> 5291.44
what

5290.4 --> 5293.12
okay

5291.44 --> 5295.599999999999
this is completely outside of my

5293.12 --> 5298.84
expertise but it seems like there

5295.6 --> 5298.84
is developments

5314.56 --> 5319.6
so there is devices

5316.48 --> 5322.4
i i saw one offered in my face for like

5319.6 --> 5325.4400000000005
14 euros on amazon so it should not be

5322.4 --> 5325.44
like this massive

5325.84 --> 5332.76
expensive thing

5328.48 --> 5332.759999999999
so yeah you could try that out

5341.12 --> 5345.599999999999
compression sucks it's an old method yes

5349.76 --> 5356.08
dude i guys i just i lit i didn't even

5353.04 --> 5358.32
know for sure what it meant

5356.08 --> 5360.8
because it doesn't sound the same as the

5358.32 --> 5362.32
dutch version which i have heard about

5360.8 --> 5364.639
i've known some people that had issues

5362.32 --> 5367.04
with that i just googled it and that's

5364.639 --> 5371.56
the first thing that popped up sometimes

5367.04 --> 5371.56
google actually can be helpful

5382.0 --> 5388.0
surgically room i wouldn't do that ares

5384.239 --> 5390.5599999999995
106. i wouldn't do that

5388.0 --> 5392.8
it's like removing veins is never a good

5390.56 --> 5394.96
idea

5392.8 --> 5396.88
besides why would you

5394.96 --> 5397.84
apparently there is a device that just

5396.88 --> 5399.92
kind of

5397.84 --> 5403.76
makes that go away

5399.92 --> 5407.32
using blue light it's

5403.76 --> 5407.320000000001
i don't know why

5420.719 --> 5424.96
oh

5422.96 --> 5427.96
okay guns have never run i will check it

5424.96 --> 5427.96
out

5435.84 --> 5442.2390000000005
yes thank you thank you very much

5439.04 --> 5442.239
wow you guys just are

5442.48 --> 5449.4
being really supportive in the last week

5445.52 --> 5449.400000000001
thank you very much man

5456.159 --> 5459.159
awesome

5524.08 --> 5528.719
i'm glad you all think it's such a joke

5529.679 --> 5536.0
some people actually

5531.6 --> 5537.92
like it's not blessing to have that okay

5536.0 --> 5540.32
so funny like oh just

5537.92 --> 5543.92
saw it off and become a pirate with a

5540.32 --> 5547.84
wooden leg oh that's so funny

5543.92 --> 5547.84
it's not so funny when you got it

5558.96 --> 5562.159
you think that people will eventually

5560.48 --> 5564.32
accept yeah

5562.159 --> 5566.638999999999
sure

5564.32 --> 5569.599999999999
those that are willing to accept reality

5566.639 --> 5572.719
in any form yes why not but there's no

5569.6 --> 5574.88
issue it's not about the people that are

5572.719 --> 5576.4800000000005
whether they are capable of accepting

5574.88 --> 5579.1990000000005
flat earth it's always about whether

5576.48 --> 5581.28
they're willing to accept it and some

5579.199 --> 5583.28
people aren't willing to accept any

5581.28 --> 5587.199
level of reality

5583.28 --> 5590.32
they just want to destroy everything

5587.199 --> 5593.199
right and those people will never submit

5590.32 --> 5595.84
no matter what and they will always try

5593.199 --> 5598.0
to make everybody believe like nobody is

5595.84 --> 5600.4800000000005
submitting right

5598.0 --> 5603.44
they'll just bully

5600.48 --> 5606.08
their way through

5603.44 --> 5607.839999999999
as they kind of have always done

5606.08 --> 5609.76
and that will stay

5607.84 --> 5611.12
and then eventually when

5609.76 --> 5613.76
the majority of the world basically

5611.12 --> 5616.4
accepts reality for what it is and moves

5613.76 --> 5617.84
on they will be their own little

5616.4 --> 5619.199
cult

5617.84 --> 5621.52
occult

5619.199 --> 5623.12
delusional people still believing in

5621.52 --> 5625.76
things that have been obviously

5623.12 --> 5625.76
disproven

5626.719 --> 5631.199
and they will be

5628.4 --> 5634.96
like the flat earthers that they have

5631.199 --> 5636.96
iconified us as in their straw man

5634.96 --> 5639.36
conceptions

5636.96 --> 5642.08
right those crazy flat earthers that

5639.36 --> 5645.12
still believe the earth yeah yeah that's

5642.08 --> 5647.44
you you are those crazy ballers that

5645.12 --> 5648.5599999999995
despite all the evidence still thinks

5647.44 --> 5650.0
it's a ball

5648.56 --> 5652.2390000000005
that's you

5650.0 --> 5654.56
those crazy people that despite

5652.239 --> 5657.28
everything for generations and

5654.56 --> 5659.52
generations will still spout the same

5657.28 --> 5662.96
nazis over and over again

5659.52 --> 5667.1990000000005
despite all the facts the actual facts

5662.96 --> 5668.4800000000005
not the machinations and bullshitting

5667.199 --> 5672.199
yeah

5668.48 --> 5672.199
that's what's gonna happen

5677.36 --> 5681.679
okay jason mccormack so you just

5679.679 --> 5684.84
replaced one called for another haven't

5681.679 --> 5684.84
you then

5695.679 --> 5699.0
hey man

5709.76 --> 5715.08
and james mason by the way

5712.08 --> 5715.08
man

5726.4 --> 5730.0
like it will be taught in schools again

5728.48 --> 5732.638999999999
well

5730.0 --> 5734.239
not all schools

5732.639 --> 5736.0
i think that that sort of thing will

5734.239 --> 5738.638999999999
kind of just be

5736.0 --> 5740.56
put back onto the parents

5738.639 --> 5742.8
and then some schools will teach the

5740.56 --> 5744.4800000000005
heliocentric nonsense and other schools

5742.8 --> 5747.119000000001
will teach

5744.48 --> 5749.119
flat earth of some sort or maybe they'll

5747.119 --> 5753.92
just completely skip it by and just say

5749.119 --> 5753.92
like oh no it's just bible study or just

5754.32 --> 5758.0
some other study i don't know what

5756.88 --> 5760.4800000000005
they're going to do with it i don't

5758.0 --> 5761.84
think it's going to be like oh yeah oh

5760.48 --> 5765.5199999999995
of course

5761.84 --> 5766.96
westernized civilized school systems and

5765.52 --> 5769.92
all the crap that they've gone through

5766.96 --> 5771.44
oh yeah they're just going to switch to

5769.92 --> 5772.719
flatter no

5771.44 --> 5774.719
never

5772.719 --> 5777.119
never

5774.719 --> 5778.719
you're gonna have to just abandon that

5777.119 --> 5780.4
school system

5778.719 --> 5782.159
that setup because

5780.4 --> 5785.92
that cannot

5782.159 --> 5788.239
let go of it it's literally ingrained

5785.92 --> 5790.0
like the entire thing is kind of made

5788.239 --> 5791.759999999999
for that

5790.0 --> 5795.119
it's probably the reason like school

5791.76 --> 5797.04
systems came into being

5795.119 --> 5799.839999999999
is no you can't have your wrench back

5797.04 --> 5799.84
emanuel

5807.92 --> 5812.4400000000005
why the hell would a school that

5812.719 --> 5817.36
that basically starts

5814.8 --> 5820.4800000000005
just a rough example teach critical race

5817.36 --> 5822.719
theory or whatever garbage why the hell

5820.48 --> 5824.959999999999
would they ever

5822.719 --> 5827.04
stop teaching the club why why would

5824.96 --> 5830.36
they do that there's no reason for them

5827.04 --> 5830.36
to do that

5860.32 --> 5865.199
entire teach new fit no no aries 106

5863.36 --> 5869.199
that's wrong

5865.199 --> 5873.759999999999
they just have to abandon the nonsense

5869.199 --> 5873.759999999999
real physics is still like two-thirds

5875.119 --> 5879.119
like all the real physics is already

5877.119 --> 5882.88
there it's just that all the globe

5879.119 --> 5884.639
machinations [ __ ] on top of it

5882.88 --> 5889.4800000000005
just take that off

5884.639 --> 5889.4800000000005
you still got plenty to teach

5903.92 --> 5910.8
pyramids were ancient fridges what

5907.52 --> 5913.679
no there were power plants

5910.8 --> 5915.360000000001
oh because of

5913.679 --> 5917.119
they're not refrigerators that's

5915.36 --> 5918.88
ridiculous

5917.119 --> 5921.28
i mean they might have had a

5918.88 --> 5922.84
refrigeration compartment but that's not

5921.28 --> 5925.599999999999
going to be the main function that's

5922.84 --> 5929.08
ridiculous there's much much easier ways

5925.6 --> 5929.08
to build refrigerators

5950.56 --> 5954.719
where did they store the food though

5955.52 --> 5961.52
in their basement

5959.119 --> 5961.5199999999995
hello

5961.679 --> 5964.0
what

5964.08 --> 5969.6
you think they didn't have basements

5966.96 --> 5971.52
like in the shadow in the ground

5969.6 --> 5976.1990000000005
where the sun doesn't heat everything up

5971.52 --> 5976.1990000000005
as much yeah yeah they did

5989.44 --> 5995.28
right and you can also

5992.88 --> 5998.32
dry store or something there's many ways

5995.28 --> 5998.32
of storing things

5998.48 --> 6002.638999999999
i mean refrigeration is very easy and

6001.119 --> 6005.759999999999
convenient

6002.639 --> 6007.52
but it's not necessary to survive

6005.76 --> 6011.1990000000005
if it were then

6007.52 --> 6011.1990000000005
humanity wouldn't have come this far

6018.8 --> 6023.320000000001
you know what is

6020.52 --> 6025.679
extremely inefficient

6023.32 --> 6029.36
extremely inefficient

6025.679 --> 6032.2390000000005
yeah to have one giant centralized

6029.36 --> 6034.239
refrigerator

6032.239 --> 6035.678999999999
that the whole freaking region would

6034.239 --> 6039.75
have to go to

6035.679 --> 6042.719
to get the milk out of the cooler

6039.75 --> 6044.88
[Music]

6042.719 --> 6048.119
i mean come on

6044.88 --> 6048.119
that's ridiculous

6058.719 --> 6062.96
so you're saying that the pyramids were

6060.4 --> 6065.599999999999
not made to be giant fridges yeah yeah

6062.96 --> 6069.6
they weren't they were uh hydroelectric

6065.6 --> 6069.6
power plants and perhaps pumps

6072.8 --> 6080.320000000001
like automated fully automated

6076.119 --> 6080.32
non-mechanical magnetic pumps

6084.0 --> 6089.119
but they were there first and foremost

6086.96 --> 6092.0
specifically

6089.119 --> 6094.0
for water to run underneath the pyramids

6092.0 --> 6096.56
in the channels that are underneath the

6094.0 --> 6098.239
pyramids to run through them running

6096.56 --> 6101.92
water creates electricity the

6098.239 --> 6103.44
electricity would charge the rock

6101.92 --> 6106.08
specifically

6103.44 --> 6108.638999999999
the rock formations very specific types

6106.08 --> 6111.44
of rock that are viable to electricity

6108.639 --> 6114.96
in the pyramid and then it would become

6111.44 --> 6116.719
like a tesla field generator create

6114.96 --> 6119.04
electricity

6116.719 --> 6122.08
hold the tension of the water

6119.04 --> 6122.08
and enhance it

6122.32 --> 6125.36
that's what it is it's not a

6123.679 --> 6128.36
refrigerator

6125.36 --> 6128.36
no

6135.679 --> 6140.2390000000005
no no you're wrong no you see

6139.199 --> 6143.678999999999
cold

6140.239 --> 6144.879999999999
is actually not great for rock you know

6143.679 --> 6147.36
out there

6144.88 --> 6150.4800000000005
there's regions

6147.36 --> 6151.36
where it's very cold guess what

6150.48 --> 6152.638999999999
yeah

6151.36 --> 6155.839999999999
cold

6152.639 --> 6155.84
breaks stone

6156.719 --> 6162.159
because of the moist it breaks it it

6160.239 --> 6164.799999999999
like why would you build a stone

6162.159 --> 6167.04
refrigerator it's going to break

6164.8 --> 6167.04
this

6167.679 --> 6171.28
it doesn't make any logical sense

6173.679 --> 6178.159
how does a non-mechanical magnetic i

6176.0 --> 6179.92
don't know exactly

6178.159 --> 6182.08
i would have to watch the pyramid code

6179.92 --> 6184.88
again they addressed that

6182.08 --> 6184.88
specifically

6186.159 --> 6189.199
it has to do with

6189.6 --> 6192.96
like

6190.48 --> 6196.159
sort of a turbine that magnetically

6192.96 --> 6197.76
pushes on water

6196.159 --> 6200.0
it's

6197.76 --> 6200.0
yeah

6200.48 --> 6205.28
it's not critical in

6203.679 --> 6206.719
what i think about it

6205.28 --> 6209.04
i just think that it might have been a

6206.719 --> 6211.52
part two of it where just literally a

6209.04 --> 6213.84
body of water would just go up

6211.52 --> 6216.8
and down

6213.84 --> 6219.1990000000005
like a pump and it would be

6216.8 --> 6221.76
fully

6219.199 --> 6224.0
non-moving part

6221.76 --> 6224.0
thing

6226.0 --> 6232.96
perhaps they used like a separate tanker

6230.159 --> 6234.879999999999
that was had salt water in it and that

6232.96 --> 6237.679
made it magnetically viable so they

6234.88 --> 6239.4400000000005
could literally use it as a

6237.679 --> 6244.04
magnetic pump

6239.44 --> 6244.04
something like that i don't know

6254.08 --> 6259.8
hmm

6255.84 --> 6259.8
okay guns would never run

6260.719 --> 6265.119
the ruins no i've never heard of that

6262.719 --> 6268.119
before i'll check it out sounds kind of

6265.119 --> 6268.119
interesting

6279.84 --> 6282.84
uh

6287.97 --> 6292.639
[Applause]

6290.239 --> 6292.638999999999
dude

6298.0 --> 6301.239
from 2008

6308.0 --> 6311.0
hmm

6316.56 --> 6320.400000000001
all right

6318.239 --> 6324.04
i'll check it out thanks for the tip

6320.4 --> 6324.04
guns have never run

6333.52 --> 6338.119000000001
i'll get back to you about it

6360.08 --> 6365.5199999999995
that but no cbs nobody stored bodies the

6363.44 --> 6370.159
pyramids are not

6365.52 --> 6373.119000000001
freaking burial grounds it's the dumbest

6370.159 --> 6375.92
the dumbest fiction that ever came out

6373.119 --> 6378.88
of the 19th century

6375.92 --> 6380.32
absolutely ridiculous to suggest the

6378.88 --> 6383.04
pyramids

6380.32 --> 6384.08
had anything to do with burial in any

6383.04 --> 6386.639
form

6384.08 --> 6389.119
there's literally never been any

6386.639 --> 6390.8
freaking mummy or anything like that

6389.119 --> 6392.48
found in the pyramids the only thing

6390.8 --> 6396.719
that was there

6392.48 --> 6398.5599999999995
was a giant like giant

6396.719 --> 6401.92
super thick stone

6398.56 --> 6404.639
casket with absolutely nothing in it you

6401.92 --> 6406.639
know why it was there probably had a

6404.639 --> 6409.119
device stored in it

6406.639 --> 6411.04
like an actual mechanical device

6409.119 --> 6413.5199999999995
electric perhaps

6411.04 --> 6415.92
arc of the covenant thing a power source

6413.52 --> 6418.400000000001
that might have actually enhanced the

6415.92 --> 6421.52
whole power electric workings the

6418.4 --> 6423.36
charging workings of the entire system

6421.52 --> 6425.119000000001
it wasn't there anymore

6423.36 --> 6426.08
it's absolutely

6425.119 --> 6429.759999999999
not

6426.08 --> 6432.679
a burial ground the pyramids are not

6429.76 --> 6435.76
burial grounds that's what they are not

6432.679 --> 6438.88
absolutely not it's like the absolute

6435.76 --> 6438.88
least thing they are

6440.08 --> 6446.08
right just because they found like some

6442.8 --> 6448.0
skeleton right next to it

6446.08 --> 6449.6
doesn't mean oh this must be a burial

6448.0 --> 6450.8
ground and

6449.6 --> 6453.679
no

6450.8 --> 6457.679
that was literally smithsonian

6453.679 --> 6462.1990000000005
jesuit agents making up that crap

6457.679 --> 6462.1990000000005
like a bunch of lying scumbags

6470.14 --> 6473.229
[Music]

6477.04 --> 6481.92
low okay yeah laugh it up fundy it's

6479.36 --> 6483.44
what it is

6481.92 --> 6485.679
it's a lie

6483.44 --> 6488.32
palpable like there's no evidence for it

6485.679 --> 6489.679
whatsoever the dating of the pyramids is

6488.32 --> 6492.32
totally wrong

6489.679 --> 6495.88
the assigned purpose for the pyramids is

6492.32 --> 6499.36
absolutely atrociously stupid

6495.88 --> 6501.92
atrociously stupid

6499.36 --> 6504.48
there's no mummies in there ever never

6501.92 --> 6508.84
been found anything that resembles any

6504.48 --> 6508.839999999999
sort of burial ground ever

6516.4 --> 6520.638999999999
why lie why would they lie because they

6518.719 --> 6522.639
want to [ __ ] you up

6520.639 --> 6525.119
they want to show you a lie and then

6522.639 --> 6526.96
make you accept that lie and defend it

6525.119 --> 6529.679
bobby steele's it's so easy you're doing

6526.96 --> 6529.679
it right now

6530.239 --> 6534.4
yeah

6532.4 --> 6536.08
you're doing it right now

6534.4 --> 6538.239
they lie

6536.08 --> 6540.8
so that you

6538.239 --> 6543.36
can't handle it and then start defending

6540.8 --> 6543.360000000001
the lies

6544.48 --> 6550.119
that's why they lie

6546.159 --> 6550.119
can't say it any more simple

6555.199 --> 6558.719
bobby steele is a jazz no

6562.8 --> 6567.320000000001
no aries 106 no

6570.159 --> 6573.04
they don't do that

6573.84 --> 6576.08
like

6577.199 --> 6581.32
if you're an actual jesuit

6582.0 --> 6586.0
you're not a sock drawer that's

6584.48 --> 6588.159
no

6586.0 --> 6588.159
no

6589.36 --> 6594.239
i would never just casually call anybody

6591.52 --> 6596.8
a jesuit no

6594.239 --> 6600.159
when you know what a jesuit is

6596.8 --> 6602.4800000000005
then you know who is a jesuit

6600.159 --> 6605.5199999999995
because it radiates off them

6602.48 --> 6608.718999999999
and only if you understand what a jesuit

6605.52 --> 6611.84
really is what they've went through

6608.719 --> 6611.84
what happens to them

6612.08 --> 6614.8
only then

6615.36 --> 6619.5199999999995
will you realize

6616.96 --> 6624.76
who are the jesuits

6619.52 --> 6624.76
like who are the who are the ones

6624.88 --> 6629.84
jesuit is not just some stupid

6628.48 --> 6632.159
bunch of

6629.84 --> 6633.360000000001
shock troop idiots

6632.159 --> 6636.92
right

6633.36 --> 6636.92
they're not flunkies

6680.08 --> 6682.32
right

6683.04 --> 6686.8
pyramids of ouster elites

6685.119 --> 6689.839999999999
i've heard of that

6686.8 --> 6692.56
yeah george sanford i think yes there is

6689.84 --> 6693.84
fed today steamy traveler i'm gonna go

6692.56 --> 6696.0
there in about

6693.84 --> 6698.8
four minutes so i'm rounding out this

6696.0 --> 6701.679
the show soon but yeah george sanford's

6698.8 --> 6703.360000000001
pyramids dude there's pyramids

6701.679 --> 6705.679
everywhere

6703.36 --> 6708.0
everywhere there's so many of them

6705.679 --> 6710.0
they're freaking pyramids in the middle

6708.0 --> 6713.52
on the bottom of the ocean

6710.0 --> 6713.52
there's pyramids everywhere

6714.4 --> 6718.719
you know why

6716.239 --> 6722.0
why i think they're everywhere

6718.719 --> 6725.04
because they were standard technology

6722.0 --> 6728.0
they're just a power station yeah in a

6725.04 --> 6730.56
realm spanning empire maybe beyond and

6728.0 --> 6732.32
yeah they have power stations

6730.56 --> 6734.080000000001
they want power so what do they do yeah

6732.32 --> 6736.239
they build a power station it's called a

6734.08 --> 6738.0
pyramid they're everywhere because they

6736.239 --> 6741.759999999999
were everywhere

6738.0 --> 6743.199
it's the world empire of atlantis

6741.76 --> 6745.599
pre-flood

6743.199 --> 6747.919999999999
that's why there are pyramids absolutely

6745.599 --> 6749.679
everywhere everywhere

6747.92 --> 6753.4400000000005
i wouldn't be surprised if we freaking

6749.679 --> 6755.1990000000005
found pyramids at antarctica

6753.44 --> 6757.36
like under all that ice or whatever is

6755.199 --> 6758.48
left of it you know is it

6757.36 --> 6761.119
like in

6758.48 --> 6764.718999999999
eileen versus predator 2

6761.119 --> 6766.719
was it two or was it one no it's one

6764.719 --> 6768.0
was it yeah

6766.719 --> 6768.8
yeah it was one

6768.0 --> 6771.76
right

6768.8 --> 6774.400000000001
it's like oh yeah because it's probably

6771.76 --> 6776.4800000000005
true they're everywhere because it's

6774.4 --> 6780.719
just standard technology you're not

6776.48 --> 6782.718999999999
gonna build gigantic things

6780.719 --> 6785.28
is it is it that's like

6782.719 --> 6787.199
imagine this you take like a

6785.28 --> 6789.84
super giant

6787.199 --> 6792.638999999999
nuclear power plants right

6789.84 --> 6795.52
giant buildings stacks and all that oh

6792.639 --> 6798.08
and 200 years later

6795.52 --> 6799.280000000001
everything died and

6798.08 --> 6800.96
and then people come back there and

6799.28 --> 6804.239
they're like dude

6800.96 --> 6806.88
man these are some massive burial

6804.239 --> 6809.5199999999995
chambers man look at the stack oh that's

6806.88 --> 6812.0
a symbol for the the spirit coming out

6809.52 --> 6814.159000000001
of it reaching onto the heavens these

6812.0 --> 6817.84
must be

6814.159 --> 6821.44
actual burial grounds let's find

6817.84 --> 6823.04
the chamber where they buried the body

6821.44 --> 6826.638999999999
that's

6823.04 --> 6826.639
that's the pyramids

6827.119 --> 6833.04
come on it's so obvious

6829.92 --> 6836.32
why the hell would you build all that

6833.04 --> 6838.88
to as a burial ground it's ridiculous

6836.32 --> 6842.32
you only build giant things because they

6838.88 --> 6844.159000000001
have a function an actual pragmatic

6842.32 --> 6847.199
function

6844.159 --> 6850.159
you don't build insanely large buildings

6847.199 --> 6852.159
just to to decorate [ __ ]

6850.159 --> 6854.48
especially not everywhere in the world

6852.159 --> 6857.598999999999
that's ridiculous

6854.48 --> 6860.5599999999995
they're power stations that's what the

6857.599 --> 6860.56
pyramids are

6860.8 --> 6865.119000000001
and with that i'm gonna round out the
