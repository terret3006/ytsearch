oh right the ticking sound yeah Danann I

105.38 --> 114.09
see it now it's weird how it works

110.97 --> 117.06
it's almost like it's set for me to be

114.09 --> 118.92
loud specifically but I don't know how

117.06 --> 124.13
how well the sound is coming through

118.92 --> 127.98
when I'm not raising my voice so much so

124.13 --> 133.2
anyway yeah let's see the weather

127.98 --> 137.1

yeah it's it's Monday so yeah I got a

168.21 --> 174.24
new white shirt yes I thought I'm gonna

171.6 --> 177.65
be wearing these more often so I might

174.24 --> 182.01000000000002
might be better if I had it back up and

177.65 --> 188.79000000000002
yeah it wasn't even that expensive I

182.01 --> 193.89
thought so anyway I got green tea with

188.79 --> 198.41
me and some blueberries as said

193.89 --> 198.41
yesterday I would very nice

200.89 --> 205.91
great for this weather so the funny

203.06 --> 210.26
thing is I got him yesterday then put

205.91 --> 217.67
him in my in my cooler and then got him

210.26 --> 219.95
out this morning right so anyway let's

217.67 --> 224.0
see who is in chat and I started a bit

219.95 --> 228.04
early today so to compensate for

224.0 --> 232.34
yesterday a GM was first Amanda young Oh

228.04 --> 233.92
Jay to see you again good servant eyes

232.34 --> 245.06

247.87 --> 258.53000000000003
probably more will come in as the show

250.73 --> 267.49
progresses alright what was I doing

258.53 --> 267.48999999999995
yesterday hmm

270.529 --> 274.539
I remember there was some Owen Benjamin

279.909 --> 285.019
hmm I don't know why I always have so

283.159 --> 292.579
much trouble remembering what I did the

285.019 --> 294.559
day before it's not that crazy nothing's

292.579 --> 299.17900000000003
really out of the ordinary happened I

294.559 --> 303.85900000000004
think did I watch something on Netflix

299.179 --> 306.099
as well I think I'm not sure do you know

303.859 --> 306.099
how it

310.17 --> 320.02000000000004
hmm oh right yeah that's right

315.85 --> 322.84000000000003
I finished watching a movie that that

320.02 --> 328.28999999999996
was kind of have a weird weird little

322.84 --> 328.28999999999996
odd movie like a Hollywood and Western

329.13 --> 334.84
Silverado but yeah when you look at it

332.11 --> 338.25
it's it's really odd and kind of bland

334.84 --> 341.14
and boring but at the same time there

338.25 --> 346.26
there's some interesting atmospheric

341.14 --> 348.84999999999997
elements but yeah that's I don't know I

346.26 --> 351.87
bet it didn't get a very good review

348.85 --> 351.87
when it came out

356.939 --> 367.199
was a very hollow Hollywood defied

360.349 --> 372.089
Western I don't know anyway other than

367.199 --> 374.849
that oh yeah I've been finishing

372.089 --> 379.169
watching finishing up watching some

374.849 --> 384.679
series a lot of them so kind of ran out

379.169 --> 389.49
of series now but that another life I

384.679 --> 393.56899999999996
finished watching it and yeah despite

389.49 --> 399.209
all the earlier no nuisances things that

393.569 --> 402.599
I found knowing about it yeah it still

399.209 --> 404.129
kind of made me curious to see like if

402.599 --> 406.199
it would continue what they would come

404.129 --> 408.119
up with next because they did end it

406.199 --> 410.069
with like a big bombastic like

408.119 --> 412.369
cliffhanger type situation

410.069 --> 419.069
well not cliffhanger but more like

412.369 --> 422.66900000000004
foreboding situation and yeah despite

419.069 --> 424.319
earlier feelings about it I think it

422.669 --> 427.769
might still turn out to be very

424.319 --> 431.009
interesting potentially or it could get

427.769 --> 433.949
even worse you know it all depends

431.009 --> 437.249
really on like if the entire virtue

433.949 --> 440.49
signaling situation and the influences

437.249 --> 443.399
if that is really the the purpose of the

440.49 --> 446.909
whole thing or if it was kind of a lure

443.399 --> 448.949
in for an actual decent story that's

446.909 --> 451.43899999999996
kind of still hidden behind it

448.949 --> 453.119
because that stuff stands out so much I

451.439 --> 457.90900000000005
don't know we'll see if it even

453.119 --> 457.90900000000005
continues so but that was another life

458.24 --> 466.219
yeah finished up the the Good Witch a

462.919 --> 466.219
week ago

466.39 --> 477.43
it's very elaborated with my opinions

469.76 --> 477.43
about it and yes many others and yeah

477.94 --> 482.36
I'm not just gonna click some random

480.56 --> 484.34
thing series and then just start

482.36 --> 486.25
watching it it's like I'm very picky

484.34 --> 490.92999999999995
with it anyway

486.25 --> 490.93
that's flex update oh goody

495.01 --> 510.26
yeah Ballad of Buster Scruggs okie dokie

506.74 --> 513.8
never heard of that is that an older

510.26 --> 515.87
western movie like back in the day I

513.8 --> 519.62
used to watch spaghetti westerns all the

515.87 --> 523.4
time those freakin hilarious the two

519.62 --> 531.52
fists but that's yeah that's just weird

523.4 --> 531.52
this it was Italian originally anyway

532.78 --> 538.85
but yeah hobby is that on Netflix like I

536.3 --> 542.1099999999999
don't know I could try to look it up see

538.85 --> 542.11
if that exists on her

547.92 --> 566.01
why does it

550.17 --> 570.87
oh yeah it is on there okay okay thanks

566.01 --> 581.97
for the tip all oh yeah I added to the

570.87 --> 583.21
list all right with the Unisa or what's

581.97 --> 584.78
his name

583.21 --> 588.09
[Music]

584.78 --> 594.11
okay we'll see if that's interesting

588.09 --> 594.11
thanks for the tip it's a movie mm-hmm

595.97 --> 600.21
at 12

597.81 --> 604.02
okey dokey you think it's really really

600.21 --> 606.99
great well I'll test your sensibility at

604.02 --> 611.6999999999999
it I'll see if it's really as good as

606.99 --> 614.97
you think it is but yeah thanks for the

611.7 --> 622.97
tip I'll take a look Johnny Depp has

614.97 --> 622.97
always been strange what yes he has

631.51 --> 634.199
right

636.17 --> 639.4699999999999
slow Wes

640.38 --> 645.71
okay is that under flex too

655.31 --> 661.26
okay okay have one of those right

658.77 --> 664.14
collection of short stories okay well

661.26 --> 673.29
that yeah those can be very interesting

664.14 --> 675.98
sometimes sure anyway I'll be watching

673.29 --> 675.98
stuff I guess

696.3 --> 702.3299999999999
yeah you know the issue is sometimes

698.66 --> 705.39
especially in the evenings when there's

702.33 --> 707.73
more YouTube activity I just like just

705.39 --> 708.48
move around here and there but I kind of

707.73 --> 713.13
forget it

708.48 --> 716.64
like channels that just sometimes stream

713.13 --> 719.46
something or a theme thing and then I

716.64 --> 721.71
watch it but yeah give it it up for this

719.46 --> 723.51
if it's good but I do kind of typically

721.71 --> 726.5400000000001
forget about it because sometimes it's

723.51 --> 728.91
like I get like five of those from

726.54 --> 730.5899999999999
channels that I don't usually watch

728.91 --> 743.87
every day and then yeah I kind of forget

730.59 --> 746.34
about it anyway what's the the Friday's

743.87 --> 751.92
flat earth debate after show again and

746.34 --> 755.37
that was good that was good like it's

751.92 --> 758.9
fun in a way I know what it is but it's

755.37 --> 763.5600000000001
like almost comfortably fun to hear

758.9 --> 765.15
Nathan shouting at the ballers and you

763.56 --> 768.5699999999999
know at first it was kind of off-putting

765.15 --> 772.3199999999999
but then you just noticed that these

768.57 --> 775.0500000000001
people like they are affected and they

772.32 --> 778.98
and they almost like not almost they do

775.05 --> 781.14
come back for more and there's just this

778.98 --> 785.58
weird game going on and it keeps on

781.14 --> 788.36
going and going and going and yeah it's

785.58 --> 792.23
interesting to to be part of it and to

788.36 --> 792.23
just watch it sometimes

801.73 --> 806.609
all right tiny well yeah there well

804.1 --> 810.5790000000001
there's a lot of foreign series on there

806.609 --> 816.6890000000001
like Italian series and Spanish series

810.579 --> 824.169
and Turkish series and just what else

816.689 --> 828.399
like I think even Austrian co4 and

824.169 --> 832.269
Swedish series I've seen and edit and

828.399 --> 835.629
and from Norway as well I think at some

832.269 --> 840.899
point it kind of like I'm just I'm not

835.629 --> 843.16
really watching them I'm just basically

840.899 --> 849.999
scrolling over then and then hearing

843.16 --> 853.29
them speak yeah they just discovered the

849.999 --> 853.2900000000001
berries today throughout there

866.29 --> 872.68
oh by the way that sound you were

868.12 --> 875.32
hearing I think that is the the oldest

872.68 --> 886.12
of the little ones from the jackdaws and

875.32 --> 886.99
it is basically out there and flying the

886.12 --> 895.0
one in the back

886.99 --> 897.01
it's already quite big but it's just

895.0 --> 901.3
funny to see because it's basically just

897.01 --> 903.01
mimicking parrots and already figured

901.3 --> 906.93
out like hey there is water in the bowl

903.01 --> 906.93
you can just drink the water in the bowl

908.73 --> 920.5500000000001
but it's yeah it doesn't really get the

913.0 --> 920.55
normal activities yet it's just

955.04 --> 957.91
I'm drink

958.85 --> 963.35
hundred and how does that again I

963.47 --> 969.12
remember hearing of it I don't think I

965.79 --> 972.29
really watched it you know Netflix has

969.12 --> 975.33
been into like frontline sci-fi

972.29 --> 979.74
indoctrination stuff for a while it's

975.33 --> 984.09
kind of what made it so popular and so

979.74 --> 986.3100000000001
there have been a lot of series that

984.09 --> 988.8000000000001
have kind of gained headlines in the

986.31 --> 992.67
world attention and all that but I

988.8 --> 995.13
haven't watched a lot like I haven't

992.67 --> 999.41
really watched or been even a fan of

995.13 --> 1003.29
Netflix when it came out it's it's only

999.41 --> 1006.14
much later that I kind of just I'm lucky

1003.29 --> 1008.98
enough to have the access to it through

1006.14 --> 1013.1899999999999
somebody else that is subscribed to it

1008.98 --> 1015.29
through my dad's and yeah so it's kind

1013.19 --> 1021.6700000000001
of free for me and then I do check it

1015.29 --> 1021.67
out but I never really used to do that

1030.99 --> 1034.099
[Music]

1039.589 --> 1046.87
hmm the a Voynich my name is nobody yep

1044.059 --> 1055.07
yeah but that's that's like the classic

1046.87 --> 1059.9799999999998
- two fists that's exactly like the this

1055.07 --> 1059.98
most famous movie that of that duo

1062.169 --> 1067.21
that's exactly but they're generally

1065.059 --> 1069.74
referred to as spaghetti westerns

1067.21 --> 1072.289
because there's a lot of comedy in them

1069.74 --> 1073.84
like really slapstick II comedy and it's

1072.289 --> 1078.379
just brilliant

1073.84 --> 1080.72
it's absolutely silly and demeaning in

1078.379 --> 1087.9499999999998
many ways but it's just really funny I

1080.72 --> 1090.619
don't know I really enjoyed just the the

1087.95 --> 1092.749
characters the character typings and

1090.619 --> 1098.499
just the quick humor especially the

1092.749 --> 1098.499
quick stuff you know brilliant

1101.65 --> 1104.799
[Music]

1108.44 --> 1111.8600000000001
yeoman Stanley

1123.92 --> 1134.8700000000001
but so sure who God okay yeah that's

1133.16 --> 1137.78
right but Spencer Terence hell that's

1134.87 --> 1140.57
their that's their names yeah my dad

1137.78 --> 1164.8
loves them too so we used to watch that

1140.57 --> 1164.8
a lot back in the day love that stuff

1180.39 --> 1186.66
yeah I don't know if you got that it's

1182.97 --> 1188.88
just a typical like a tense scene with

1186.66 --> 1190.92
the with those guys and like some

1188.88 --> 1192.99
opponents that think that that they can

1190.92 --> 1197.8500000000001
beat them and then they just get like

1192.99 --> 1202.02
really tired and like I have to do this

1197.85 --> 1203.76
again it's just the sounds they make and

1202.02 --> 1206.67
that they're like just basically playing

1203.76 --> 1208.35
around with people that really don't

1206.67 --> 1211.6200000000001
know what they got themselves into and

1208.35 --> 1217.799
it's it's just amazing yeah how it

1211.62 --> 1220.9499999999998
turned out but they have not passed the

1217.799 --> 1222.59
test of time really so you don't think

1220.95 --> 1226.41
they're funny anymore

1222.59 --> 1228.6
but there is like very boring elements

1226.41 --> 1231.929
about them you know and they're kind of

1228.6 --> 1235.9499999999998
slow in ways but like the funny moments

1231.929 --> 1238.6100000000001
man they're not less funny now no I

1235.95 --> 1238.6100000000001
don't think so

1256.14 --> 1261.44
whoo chorus our who's that

1272.94 --> 1276.8400000000001
kudos Allah you mean

1281.63 --> 1290.41
oh oh that it's like all 20th century

1290.67 --> 1293.8490000000002
[Music]

1303.35 --> 1308.6599999999999
hmm

1305.72 --> 1312.56
I might have seen some movies of his but

1308.66 --> 1315.28
never really in any wider context

1312.56 --> 1315.28
realizing it

1326.88 --> 1335.3700000000001
a few good men I I remember that one

1332.58 --> 1337.32
or well the name I know I like it I just

1335.37 --> 1350.79
have to refresh my memory as to what it

1337.32 --> 1353.76
was again alright you can't handle the

1350.79 --> 1355.79
truth that's what it was from it's been

1353.76 --> 1359.37
a long time since I've seen that movie

1355.79 --> 1364.1399999999999
but I might actually still have it on my

1359.37 --> 1366.59
computer it's been a long time let's see

1364.14 --> 1366.5900000000001
if it's in there

1371.18 --> 1377.39
or it could have been on my old

1373.01 --> 1385.97
hard-disk that's unfortunately no longer

1377.39 --> 1391.16
functional hmm yeah I think it wasn't my

1385.97 --> 1397.73
old computer now maybe I should download

1391.16 --> 1399.8600000000001
it again yeah I remember the the Jack

1397.73 --> 1402.04
Nicholson and Tom Cruise and and all

1399.86 --> 1402.04
that

1402.49 --> 1408.1
anyway wow we're talking about movies a

1405.23 --> 1408.1
lot today aren't we

1423.71 --> 1432.529
yeah really Ares 106 you can handle the

1428.399 --> 1432.529
truth about flattered

1457.12 --> 1459.1499999999999
Oh

1459.65 --> 1467.029
yes by the way is this

1463.7 --> 1468.74
I saw something from some time ago I

1467.029 --> 1472.37
don't even know where it came from I

1468.74 --> 1474.35
don't remember where I saw it but it

1472.37 --> 1476.539
wasn't a YouTube video I know that

1474.35 --> 1480.3799999999999
somebody showed it during a show or

1476.539 --> 1484.25
something yeah a scene from the movie

1480.38 --> 1487.0100000000002
Sinbad where they reached the edge of

1484.25 --> 1488.87
the earth and we're gazing at some

1487.01 --> 1489.5
portal of the distance I've never seen

1488.87 --> 1494.0
that before

1489.5 --> 1496.85
I thought that simbad was like a Mandela

1494.0 --> 1502.46
affected away movie or something wasn't

1496.85 --> 1507.26
it so where did that scene come from it

1502.46 --> 1511.3990000000001
was a fully visual was it the Disney

1507.26 --> 1513.44
like movie or Pixar like movie scene so

1511.399 --> 1516.08
does that move you still exist or

1513.44 --> 1518.289
doesn't it am i confusing it for another

1516.08 --> 1518.289
one

1522.59 --> 1526.4189999999999
don't you remember where side

1536.54 --> 1539.54
anyone

1544.88 --> 1554.38
now good servant that this was a

1551.03 --> 1554.3799999999999

messing it up oh my mandela lore is

1599.89 --> 1606.2800000000002
terrible right I've never even seen seen

1605.38 --> 1611.65
that before

1606.28 --> 1617.34
so now Pixar okay yeah well I messed it

1611.65 --> 1617.3400000000001
up completely not a good movie expert

1622.919 --> 1628.7
because in that movie they they kind of

1625.109 --> 1628.6999999999998
did make a flat earth joke

1633.09 --> 1640.399
so yeah legend of the seas season 1 what

1643.59 --> 1647.57
Oh God

1649.4 --> 1651.43
Oh

1657.23 --> 1671.72
yeah talking about spongebob right I

1660.559 --> 1673.76
heard something that's just like

1671.72 --> 1677.75
apparently they officially want to make

1673.76 --> 1679.309
him gay now and get yeah as expected

1677.75 --> 1689.559
there's not a lot of people very happy

1679.309 --> 1692.059
about that it might just be a stupid

1689.559 --> 1694.269
social media rumor though I don't know

1692.059 --> 1694.269
man

1705.66 --> 1716.5500000000002
Majid of the Seas season 1 was the

1710.91 --> 1720.39
symbol animation 2003 legend of this ok

1716.55 --> 1722.57
so it is of a series that's what you're

1720.39 --> 1722.5700000000002
saying

1731.29 --> 1741.86
mixed up a guy named sim bat being the

1734.75 --> 1743.6
genie oh oh okay okay thanks well at

1741.86 --> 1753.56
least my mistake wasn't completely

1743.6 --> 1756.82
random then I just mixed it up thanks

1753.56 --> 1756.82
for clarifying that acaba

1758.08 --> 1783.23
all right okay well I guess yeah I'm not

1766.07 --> 1791.3
gonna mix that up anymore after seven

1783.23 --> 1795.8600000000001
seas yeah yeah I might look that up like

1791.3 --> 1798.9099999999999
is it a good animated movie or series is

1795.86 --> 1801.32
that is it any good or is it just

1798.91 --> 1804.67
interesting that they had this mention

1801.32 --> 1804.6699999999998
of flat earth in there is that all

1848.69 --> 1852.5900000000001
they're so angry

1858.67 --> 1868.0700000000002
under a goof ball a golf ball

1864.89 --> 1874.76
under a goof ball all right a man like

1868.07 --> 1876.8899999999999
me yeah that's right well a man like him

1874.76 --> 1881.96
yeah I'm pretty sure that golfers take

1876.89 --> 1885.6100000000001
into account the wind and what is it

1881.96 --> 1888.89
like this spin or whatever they're gonna

1885.61 --> 1891.1899999999998
you know ask Rasta had he actually knows

1888.89 --> 1893.21
some things about golfing I do not I

1891.19 --> 1895.16
would probably do pretty well

1893.21 --> 1898.03
intuitively once I got the hang of it

1895.16 --> 1903.23
because my intuition is extremely sharp

1898.03 --> 1908.36
once I adapt but yeah I don't know about

1903.23 --> 1910.66
techniques but I'm pretty sure they

1908.36 --> 1913.28
don't take into account Coriolis effect

1910.66 --> 1916.52
I'm pretty sure that the direction

1913.28 --> 1919.91
you're you're gonna shoot at does not

1916.52 --> 1924.53
matter in the slightest the thing that

1919.91 --> 1927.49
matters is the wind direction so that's

1924.53 --> 1927.49
as far as I could tell

1934.21 --> 1937.45
what's it

1945.029 --> 1954.959
Flat Earth sniper yeah pointed at the

1952.559 --> 1961.979
mountain bear animation do go watch it

1954.959 --> 1965.579
it's pretty awesome and somebody even

1961.979 --> 1969.479
like made a metal song like a cartoon

1965.579 --> 1973.109
intro song about it metella style or

1969.479 --> 1977.309
like 80s rock metal whatever you call

1973.109 --> 1991.559
that I had that song in my mind for like

1977.309 --> 1994.109
two days right then of course distance

1991.559 --> 1996.719
which Club to choose right and that has

1994.109 --> 2001.999
to do with the entire weight of what its

1996.719 --> 2007.069
gonna be impacted with so they really

2001.999 --> 2012.099
try to translate weight into effective

2007.069 --> 2012.099
distance through applied force I think

2016.49 --> 2034.74
we called that 80s heavy metal for pool

2019.89 --> 2042.72
rock okay while we're talking about golf

2034.74 --> 2049.77
now Ari I did play a lot of mini golf in

2042.72 --> 2053.879
my teens like especially on vacations

2049.77 --> 2056.369
and now mini golf was at least yeah

2053.879 --> 2060.5699999999997
interesting because you have to be

2056.369 --> 2062.82
tactical and careful and I know a lot of

2060.57 --> 2066.409
other stuff is just was that was

2062.82 --> 2073.9500000000003
available is more like dumb amusement

2066.409 --> 2076.139
and yeah it like many co I used to but I

2073.95 --> 2078.4089999999997
preferred video games though let's be

2076.139 --> 2081.4190000000003
clear about that

2078.409 --> 2088.649
but that was back then when video games

2081.419 --> 2097.56
were still interesting to me the Wii

2088.649 --> 2100.14
golf game oh gods no no no when it comes

2097.56 --> 2105.65
to that I definitely prefer real

2100.14 --> 2108.0299999999997
mini-golf and that over game golf Oh

2105.65 --> 2111.06
terrible now one of the great advantages

2108.03 --> 2114.3590000000004
of actual golf is that you're outside in

2111.06 --> 2117.18
nature with fresh air and [ __ ] staring

2114.359 --> 2121.5499999999997
at the screen and then imagining you're

2117.18 --> 2121.5499999999997
there that's not very satisfying to me

2130.52 --> 2135.18
sorry for those who really liked golf

2133.349 --> 2137.01
games you know I guess it could be like

2135.18 --> 2140.25
oh you're bored and you'll put your

2137.01 --> 2142.17
mobile you just do that because you

2140.25 --> 2145.28
really want to play golf and you can't

2142.17 --> 2147.54
or something you know then I guess yeah

2145.28 --> 2149.75
might work because you're actually

2147.54 --> 2154.17
longing for the real thing or something

2149.75 --> 2157.92
but like doing that when you don't

2154.17 --> 2160.56
really like playing go I don't know man

2157.92 --> 2162.65
just makes no sense but I guess there's

2160.56 --> 2167.0099999999998
plenty of people wanting to play golf

2162.65 --> 2169.14
golf and I just don't have the time

2167.01 --> 2172.619
but they do have like 10 minutes break

2169.14 --> 2180.96
time on their mobiles so I guess that's

2172.619 --> 2192.63
what that's playing into or winter

2180.96 --> 2199.099
activity yeah you left the sound of the

2192.63 --> 2199.099
crowd with Wii golf well yeah

2204.32 --> 2210.36
it makes you feel less alone doesn't it

2207.39 --> 2214.7999999999997
this virtual sound of people around you

2210.36 --> 2216.84
yeah it's what they're playing into so

2214.8 --> 2224.01
you can be surrounded by people without

2216.84 --> 2225.9300000000003
being surrounded by people because

2224.01 --> 2228.3
actual people actually see who you are

2225.93 --> 2231.24
and feel that you might actually be

2228.3 --> 2233.51
lonely and then it won't be the same

2231.24 --> 2233.5099999999998
thing

2237.08 --> 2243.21
do you take the wind into account

2239.82 --> 2247.9500000000003
probably it's probably shown by like a a

2243.21 --> 2250.77
narrow bar or something usually I have

2247.95 --> 2253.71
seen golf games I'd like I haven't

2250.77 --> 2257.49
played it myself but I've seen golf

2253.71 --> 2259.2
games on YouTube like okay somebody's

2257.49 --> 2262.08
playing golf game I'm not gonna really

2259.2 --> 2265.2799999999997
stick to that but I'll see just want to

2262.08 --> 2269.8199999999997
see like what did it what it is and then

2265.28 --> 2272.2200000000003
move on after like two minutes all right

2269.82 --> 2277.53
and it usually does tell wind speeds and

2272.22 --> 2280.1099999999997
stuff and just instead of using your

2277.53 --> 2282.27
senses and sizing it up with your body

2280.11 --> 2288.27
and all that you just look at the two

2282.27 --> 2293.97
arrows and that's your senses that's the

2288.27 --> 2296.97
game we calculate all bandsaw bandit I

2293.97 --> 2299.5699999999997
should time you out for that that's

2296.97 --> 2299.5699999999997
terrible

2305.63 --> 2309.67
you better be joking about that

2317.25 --> 2320.329
[Music]

2327.89 --> 2333.65
well you're right okay I thought so

2331.73 --> 2336.319
because that would be messed up if they

2333.65 --> 2341.599
start inserting that nonsense into games

2336.319 --> 2343.839
I could imagine it would be relatively

2341.599 --> 2347.029
easy to do it's it but it's just

2343.839 --> 2348.71
annoying and in the way I don't think

2347.029 --> 2351.859
people would really appreciate it if

2348.71 --> 2353.989
they had to suddenly keep their mind on

2351.859 --> 2356.63
coriolis during such games because she

2353.989 --> 2360.859
never do a reality so it's just a stupid

2356.63 --> 2362.96
distraction anyway yeah it was kind of

2360.859 --> 2365.15
funny but I wasn't sure if you were

2362.96 --> 2367.069
joking or not you know you never really

2365.15 --> 2376.76
know these days with how far they'll

2367.069 --> 2378.0389999999998
push the nonsense what is it Lottie

2376.76 --> 2382.2690000000002
[Music]

2378.039 --> 2382.2690000000002
you're not supposed to be in here

2382.779 --> 2389.089
anything to contribute or you you just

2387.109 --> 2398.68
need need somebody to ban you again is

2389.089 --> 2398.68
that it hey Julia Pavan

2405.97 --> 2414.22
I did Dan saw bandit I didn't think it

2411.609 --> 2416.68
it worked a little bit too well so I

2414.22 --> 2420.5989999999997
really thought like what no way because

2416.68 --> 2420.5989999999997
I don't know could be that crazy

2436.44 --> 2442.35
yeah lotty golf and drugs is not a good

2440.28 --> 2444.7000000000003
day out because that way you lose a lot

2442.35 --> 2447.08
of balls

2444.7 --> 2450.18
[Music]

2447.08 --> 2456.18
they don't really appreciate that sort

2450.18 --> 2457.98
of thing at golf courses I don't even

2456.18 --> 2461.79
know if it's allowed to do even then

2457.98 --> 2464.01
drink alcohol on golf courses although

2461.79 --> 2471.54
I'm pretty sure they have a bar at every

2464.01 --> 2473.82
golf course I don't know it probably

2471.54 --> 2477.2599999999998
depends on on just the owner of the golf

2473.82 --> 2477.26
course how much they care

2481.79 --> 2488.0299999999997
I meant talking about golf oh yeah it

2485.24 --> 2491.0
was brought up that's why I never even

2488.03 --> 2493.3590000000004
played real golf like never ever even

2491.0 --> 2493.359
tried it

2493.66 --> 2501.77
well no that's not true I might have

2497.54 --> 2503.59
tried it like once and cuz it just

2501.77 --> 2515.48
happened to be there or something I

2503.59 --> 2519.6800000000003
don't know hey heyy Szymanski yeah I

2515.48 --> 2523.4900000000002
hurt you on globe busters yesterday it

2519.68 --> 2526.8399999999997
was the best part of the show and

2523.49 --> 2526.8399999999997
everybody knew it

2536.45 --> 2539.5499999999997
[Music]

2540.19 --> 2545.699
yep

2542.61 --> 2545.699
[Music]

2549.32 --> 2561.36
now your goal for to write you it will

2558.27 --> 2563.9
be interesting though I'm almost

2561.36 --> 2569.25
starting to envision a concept here of

2563.9 --> 2573.81
like a flat earther versus globe or golf

2569.25 --> 2574.86
tournament then you are Rasta hat can

2573.81 --> 2576.42
pick out

2574.86 --> 2580.8900000000003
yeah the flat earthers you want to get

2576.42 --> 2585.06
involved and then the globus can yeah

2580.89 --> 2590.49
can see who they can snare to represent

2585.06 --> 2592.5499999999997
their side oh you hate it okay never

2590.49 --> 2592.5499999999997
mind

2592.7 --> 2599.31
[Music]

2596.78 --> 2602.4300000000003
but I know arrest us a pretty decent

2599.31 --> 2609.45
golfer so he said and I trust him on

2602.43 --> 2616.8599999999997
that it is you know I don't know maybe

2609.45 --> 2621.3199999999997
and maybe I'm too soon yep the worldwide

2616.86 --> 2621.32
Flat Earth golf tournament

2626.82 --> 2629.8790000000004
[Music]

2638.77 --> 2645.0099999999998
you know what now thinking about it it

2641.38 --> 2650.4300000000003
would be a challenging and amusing golf

2645.01 --> 2657.2200000000003
course to have the flat earth disc model

2650.43 --> 2660.43
right very large just the disc model the

2657.22 --> 2665.14
earth and then we're yeah the land is

2660.43 --> 2668.3799999999997
like to scale sort of so the land that's

2665.14 --> 2672.85
above the water is going to be dry land

2668.38 --> 2675.61
with grass or whatever and then they

2672.85 --> 2678.94
potentially even add some mountainous

2675.61 --> 2681.67
places to represent it and then I don't

2678.94 --> 2683.29
know do with yeah you set where the hole

2681.67 --> 2687.4500000000003
is you said where the starting place is

2683.29 --> 2690.67
on whatever continent and see I know

2687.45 --> 2690.6699999999996
[Music]

2690.72 --> 2699.58
shouldn't be too difficult to you at

2693.52 --> 2702.82
least build that Paul I should be trying

2699.58 --> 2705.06
to give Effie handicap how does that

2702.82 --> 2705.06
work

2719.65 --> 2724.84
oh right yeah just tune in for the first

2723.37 --> 2729.99
time right yeah we were talking about

2724.84 --> 2735.76
the worldwide Flat Earth golf tournament

2729.99 --> 2740.5899999999997
that's right so I don't know when it's

2735.76 --> 2743.4900000000002
gonna happen but I think I think it

2740.59 --> 2743.4900000000002
could be interesting

2791.34 --> 2798.5
hey Amanda yoke Matt welcome back yeah

2796.89 --> 2804.1099999999997
we were just talking about the

2798.5 --> 2804.11
International Flat Earth golf tournament

2804.95 --> 2809.72
somewhere in the future I don't know how

2807.36 --> 2809.7200000000003
near

2837.609 --> 2847.569
okay looks like somebody walked into the

2844.91 --> 2847.569
wrong saloon

2860.93 --> 2867.0299999999997
okey-dokey well I don't recommend doing

2863.52 --> 2869.75
drugs and going out golfing but a

2867.03 --> 2869.75
whatever you like

2905.26 --> 2915.3100000000004
yes

2906.56 --> 2915.31
another minor god yeah I'm doing great

2917.5 --> 2921.53
talking about

2919.04 --> 2925.0
I don't know trivial things I guess

2921.53 --> 2930.1000000000004
movies and Netflix series and now Golf

2925.0 --> 2935.02
and the in the near future

2930.1 --> 2935.02
International Flat Earth golf tournament

2940.85 --> 2948.37
yeah golf is for people that can't play

2943.25 --> 2948.37
pool well I have played a lot of pool I

2948.94 --> 2955.94
always forget how good I can be at it

2951.44 --> 2958.01
and yeah I don't know when I'm sometimes

2955.94 --> 2959.7200000000003
I'm not attuned and nothing really works

2958.01 --> 2961.34
out and then I get attuned and like

2959.72 --> 2965.8999999999996
everything works out I don't know how

2961.34 --> 2971.21
that works with me but I've played a lot

2965.9 --> 2975.65
of it we you two used to have a pool

2971.21 --> 2976.25
table like in in the farmhouse from my

2975.65 --> 2977.81
grandmother

2976.25 --> 2981.91
we're like the family used to come

2977.81 --> 2981.91
together so we played plenty of pool and

2984.13 --> 2992.9900000000002
yeah when I used to go to like going out

2989.24 --> 2995.0899999999997
on Saturdays at bars and stuff yeah I'd

2992.99 --> 2998.45
always be playing pool if there was an

2995.09 --> 3000.75
even if there wasn't too big a crowd

2998.45 --> 3000.75
waiting

3021.41 --> 3027.89
playing pool and drugs I don't know I

3024.77 --> 3037.25
think it's more playing pool and beer

3027.89 --> 3039.08
and such pool tables don't work on a

3037.25 --> 3041.23
baller that's right in mine god they

3039.08 --> 3041.23
don't

3066.86 --> 3069.55
hmm

3071.42 --> 3082.42
right well Robin Stanley Yau who knows

3076.599 --> 3082.42
it would be more accessible that way

3085.24 --> 3093.41
because yeah you don't need an entire

3087.559 --> 3095.42
golf park so yeah who knows if flattered

3093.41 --> 3100.0589999999997
at the international pool tournament

3095.42 --> 3100.059
that will be fun at least

3111.4 --> 3119.03
alright it is easier to organize and

3114.38 --> 3122.29
technically you yeah you could even just

3119.03 --> 3132.65
do it at people's homes if they have a

3122.29 --> 3134.9
enough room and a pool table or I don't

3132.65 --> 3136.64
know maybe even a portable pool table I

3134.9 --> 3139.7000000000003
don't know how complicated that would be

3136.64 --> 3144.58
and then just take it to wherever the

3139.7 --> 3144.58
there is room I don't know

3159.2 --> 3164.46
[Music]

3161.869 --> 3166.44
right hey but if we're going to go at

3164.46 --> 3168.7400000000002
that you know and then why not get a

3166.44 --> 3171.89
flat earth ping-pong tournament as well

3168.74 --> 3175.6499999999996
now I'm actually kind of good at that or

3171.89 --> 3177.5589999999997
well I haven't done it in a long time it

3175.65 --> 3181.529
used to be really good at that

3177.559 --> 3183.7200000000003
not for extremely long periods made it

3181.529 --> 3188.609
good like really focus and do like the

3183.72 --> 3193.6189999999997
speech yet I've done that so who knows

3188.609 --> 3198.15
this maybe maybe it should be all kinds

3193.619 --> 3205.289
of these difficult sport games table

3198.15 --> 3216.89
tennis pool flat earth darts I could go

3205.289 --> 3220.88
all over the place with that like the

3216.89 --> 3220.8799999999997
cafe Sports Olympics

3231.68 --> 3234.7599999999998
right anyway

3262.14 --> 3266.97
oh right and remember yesterday I

3264.45 --> 3269.16
brought up um this is something I'm

3266.97 --> 3272.22
breaking away from the subjects enough

3269.16 --> 3277.589
sports already but it is fun it's fun to

3272.22 --> 3279.529
think about it and yeah things could be

3277.589 --> 3284.67
done if there's enough animal for it

3279.529 --> 3288.39
we'll see but I remember I mentioned

3284.67 --> 3293.039
yesterday about the situation that was

3288.39 --> 3296.7
it again yeah that like the Health

3293.039 --> 3300.4500000000003
Minister ordered a for a billion euros

3296.7 --> 3305.0389999999998
in vaccines right well that whole

3300.45 --> 3307.769
situation like I read back today and

3305.039 --> 3310.739
it's like it's like everybody's freaking

3307.769 --> 3312.569
pissed off about that [ __ ] so that's

3310.739 --> 3318.7200000000003
good that at least there's a lot of

3312.569 --> 3321.299
noise happening about it and yeah who

3318.72 --> 3324.7389999999996
knows it might actually be reversed

3321.299 --> 3324.739
somehow that would be good

3329.85 --> 3332.969
[Music]

3346.22 --> 3350.7999999999997
a blue marble dartboard what

3368.32 --> 3375.27
anyway yeah it seems like you guys are

3370.81 --> 3378.27
not gonna move out of the sports mindset

3375.27 --> 3378.27
today

3391.02 --> 3395.81
calls it with laugh what

3414.09 --> 3422.55
there they are now to be hit hard

3418.86 --> 3426.3900000000003
oh really according to WHO will told

3422.55 --> 3430.8900000000003
them that or are they going to be hit

3426.39 --> 3436.68
hard with the measures because still

3430.89 --> 3440.42
yeah I still don't see any actual yeah

3436.68 --> 3440.4199999999996
outbreak or something no

3453.3 --> 3461.1000000000004
yeah I think that everybody's getting

3457.44 --> 3469.29
kind of sick of it but metaphorically

3461.1 --> 3474.27
sick not actually getting it Black Swan

3469.29 --> 3476.63
darts why not that's a good one Julia

3474.27 --> 3476.63
Kevin

3485.91 --> 3493.3199999999997
oh of yeah but mine look absolutely look

3490.74 --> 3498.27
if people resist there they're gonna the

3493.32 --> 3501.75
media is gonna I'm up the threat the

3498.27 --> 3503.87
virtual threat even more that's the

3501.75 --> 3505.59
tactic but it's always a bluff

3503.87 --> 3509.16
everything about it's a bluff because

3505.59 --> 3512.4
nothing does really happen except

3509.16 --> 3516.39
they're getting psychologically attacked

3512.4 --> 3520.38
even more so they are under more virtual

3516.39 --> 3522.7999999999997
danger virtual pressure and that's the

3520.38 --> 3522.8
tactic

3540.53 --> 3547.8300000000004
right well I'm not gonna wear masks

3544.73 --> 3550.71
unless I really would have to because

3547.83 --> 3553.2599999999998
yeah apparently now still transport you

3550.71 --> 3556.98
can't be allowed in like trains without

3553.26 --> 3559.94
wearing that [ __ ] and I don't have any

3556.98 --> 3565.2
any other means of transport although

3559.94 --> 3567.06
technically I could like hire a car if I

3565.2 --> 3572.8199999999997
really need it to because I do have a

3567.06 --> 3576.72
driver's license but yeah if it's like -

3572.82 --> 3579.599
yeah but I at this point I'd like to

3576.72 --> 3583.23
prevent that at all cost because that

3579.599 --> 3585.839
you don't wanna even I think it's

3583.23 --> 3592.17
already kind of unacceptable that that's

3585.839 --> 3595.37
the case right now that you have to wear

3592.17 --> 3598.51
a stupid mask in a train

3595.37 --> 3598.5099999999998
[Music]

3601.01 --> 3606.8300000000004
maybe even in buses I don't know I'm not

3604.59 --> 3606.83
sure

3617.47 --> 3624.9599999999996
but yeah concerning the whole vaccine

3620.71 --> 3629.38
situation I'm not just gonna accept

3624.96 --> 3634.93
saying no and not taking it and whatever

3629.38 --> 3638.109
no no no no no I am NOT gonna be held

3634.93 --> 3641.41
financially accountable for the money

3638.109 --> 3648.8489999999997
that is being wasted on that chemical

3641.41 --> 3651.64
crap so I want people that are deciding

3648.849 --> 3654.849
this that are just making these

3651.64 --> 3657.3689999999997
decisions for us that they will be held

3654.849 --> 3661.119
personally financially accountable and

3657.369 --> 3665.8
that there will be people dedicated to

3661.119 --> 3670.02
ensuring that they pay it all back every

3665.8 --> 3670.02
freaking last cent of it

3676.04 --> 3681.49
the individuals that decide this and I

3678.8 --> 3684.38
don't care what the supposed judicial

3681.49 --> 3686.0299999999997
situation is concerning that as a

3684.38 --> 3688.94
government official they're allowed to

3686.03 --> 3694.7000000000003
do that and they don't have that's very

3688.94 --> 3697.07
nice yeah you're gonna literally Rob the

3694.7 --> 3701.18
people with their tax dollars under some

3697.07 --> 3703.9100000000003
medical fascist [ __ ] then you are

3701.18 --> 3706.73
literally gonna pay every freakin sent

3703.91 --> 3709.0699999999997
back out of your own pocket and wherever

3706.73 --> 3715.4
pots of gold you got hidden abroad

3709.07 --> 3732.32
buddies I'm a very strong proponent of

3715.4 --> 3736.7000000000003
making this happen not tax money

3732.32 --> 3739.34
look I really if people are so for it

3736.7 --> 3742.5699999999997
you know they really personally are for

3739.34 --> 3748.9900000000002
it then you literally donate money for

3742.57 --> 3751.73
it but you're not gonna freakin force it

3748.99 --> 3754.3689999999997
just on the general public through tax

3751.73 --> 3758.27
money no you're not gonna do that

3754.369 --> 3760.42
it's unacceptable even if they don't

3758.27 --> 3764.84
have to take it I don't care

3760.42 --> 3770.66
using my money our money and then

3764.84 --> 3772.9100000000003
manipulating people to take it no I will

3770.66 --> 3776.17
not be held financially accountable for

3772.91 --> 3776.17
some eugenics project

3787.1 --> 3795.06
anyway on that heated out I'm gonna

3791.67 --> 3798.1800000000003
round out the show cuz yeah it's almost

3795.06 --> 3800.07
3 o'clock so yeah thanks everyone for

3798.18 --> 3801.18
coming I hope you like to show it was a

3800.07 --> 3803.13
bit all over the place

3801.18 --> 3806.73
talk about next like some movies and

3803.13 --> 3814.2000000000003
sports and then flowers international

3806.73 --> 3817.11
tournaments and yeah ending up with with

3814.2 --> 3819.5
the freaking tax situations where we're

3817.11 --> 3822.15
being forced to pay for these vaccines

3819.5 --> 3824.76
which is unacceptable to me like

3822.15 --> 3827.64
particularly unacceptable because

3824.76 --> 3829.8300000000004
there's absolutely absolutely not a

3827.64 --> 3833.16
positive thing that could possibly come

3829.83 --> 3836.13
out of it you know if there was like a

3833.16 --> 3839.46
halfway wasted project you know if it's

3836.13 --> 3841.1400000000003
funded then at least half of it is not

3839.46 --> 3843.39
wasted it could be used for other stuff

3841.14 --> 3846.54
you know makes it slightly less

3843.39 --> 3848.7599999999998
objectionable but this is just a pure

3846.54 --> 3852.5
hundred percent waste of money and

3848.76 --> 3858.0600000000004
actually creating worse things only only

3852.5 --> 3860.4
so yeah unacceptable not my tax money so

3858.06 --> 3862.08
anyway if you liked the show then please

3860.4 --> 3863.46
