most beautiful clearest blue sky

138.4 --> 143.52
evenings that i've seen in a while

141.68 --> 147.48000000000002
fortunately today looks like it's not

143.52 --> 147.48000000000002
going to be one of those days

159.76 --> 164.48
but yeah despite that there's still some

162.0 --> 166.319
sun coming through and

164.48 --> 167.51899999999998
it's nice maybe the wind will blow it

166.319 --> 169.76
all away

167.519 --> 172.64000000000001
kind of hope so i really like that clear

blue sky evening yesterday

172.64 --> 175.11999999999998

july uh now june 2022

224.89 --> 229.2
[Music]

226.879 --> 229.2
right

236.72 --> 240.799
so yeah yesterday was overall

238.48 --> 243.51899999999998
interesting day

240.799 --> 245.84
i watched back like half of my stream

243.519 --> 250.4
from yesterday and yeah it was pretty

245.84 --> 250.4
intense but still made good points

251.28 --> 255.28
i had a lot of

252.72 --> 256.479
trouble though

255.28 --> 260.56
i was like

256.479 --> 264.639
too much into the conversation and

260.56 --> 266.88
maybe not clarifying enough i mean

264.639 --> 268.72
i had trouble like following what i was

266.88 --> 270.56
saying

268.72 --> 271.6
like you have to really follow it from

270.56 --> 273.44
the start

271.6 --> 275.28000000000003
and look carefully in the chat and then

273.44 --> 278.28
you get it i have to do something about

275.28 --> 278.28
that

282.88 --> 287.12
i have to find a way to basically

287.6 --> 291.759
be less bound into the direct

289.6 --> 293.199
interaction with my chat and yeah it is

291.759 --> 294.47900000000004
what i do

293.199 --> 297.28000000000003
and try to

294.479 --> 298.96
keep in mind that there's onlookers that

297.28 --> 300.71999999999997
are trying to understand what i'm

298.96 --> 303.039
talking about of course so i have to

300.72 --> 306.08000000000004
like keep

303.039 --> 307.759
making that clear

306.08 --> 310.0
something i'm gonna have to pay

307.759 --> 311.52000000000004
attention to

310.0 --> 314.88
otherwise i thought i made some good

311.52 --> 318.79999999999995
points and yeah offered up a challenge

314.88 --> 320.88
still you know the whole astrology thing

318.8 --> 324.24
and jesus talked about i really want to

320.88 --> 327.6
have a discussion about this

324.24 --> 330.56
like maybe with adam meekin because he's

327.6 --> 333.12
like much more well studied into

330.56 --> 335.199
the details of all these things

333.12 --> 336.8
because he's basically we're like on the

335.199 --> 338.40000000000003
same tracks

336.8 --> 340.8
for a while

338.4 --> 343.52
adam meekin and i

340.8 --> 343.52000000000004
many ways

345.12 --> 350.4
so yeah i didn't really get challenged

348.4 --> 352.63899999999995
was just borders boy

350.4 --> 354.96
complaining

352.639 --> 357.6
accusing not really

354.96 --> 359.44
digging it out like somebody got some

357.6 --> 361.91900000000004
quote from the bible

359.44 --> 364.88
but it was just that one sentence nobody

361.919 --> 367.68
really got into it nobody responded even

364.88 --> 370.0
in the chat to what i was talking about

367.68 --> 373.039
my explanation like

370.0 --> 376.24
who is he if jesus said that who's he

373.039 --> 376.24
probably talking about

376.4 --> 380.71999999999997
right what's the context all that i

378.56 --> 383.68
didn't get any elaborated

380.72 --> 387.759
elaboration on that so

383.68 --> 387.759
still hoping to get that at some point

388.24 --> 394.52
because yeah it's not going to be the

390.08 --> 394.52
last person that's going to say that

396.88 --> 400.88
anyway

397.84 --> 400.88
a maxi dinnage

402.16 --> 405.639
flatter sage

412.479 --> 416.8
godzilla

414.479 --> 421.639
nor have you ever provided just one

416.8 --> 421.639
proof low model being real yeah yeah

432.72 --> 435.72
uh

447.759 --> 451.759
anyway yeah yesterday's war yesterday

450.24 --> 454.479
were all kinds of streams no ball

451.759 --> 454.47900000000004
busters but

456.96 --> 461.68
dell from beyond imaginary curve was

459.12 --> 461.68
live again

461.759 --> 466.24
it was interesting to sit through that

464.96 --> 469.12
and

466.24 --> 471.52
yeah martin litke

469.12 --> 473.919
i don't always like go visit his streams

471.52 --> 476.15999999999997
but this time i felt like it and yeah

473.919 --> 479.639
was cool

476.16 --> 479.639
he took notice

482.639 --> 487.44
i don't know if like martin actually

484.96 --> 489.28
follows my show or

487.44 --> 491.12
how that works

489.28 --> 493.84
i don't know if he does i mean i do have

491.12 --> 496.08
an everyday show so he probably takes as

493.84 --> 497.35999999999996
a takes a glimpse every now and then or

496.08 --> 499.599
something

497.36 --> 499.599
but

500.0 --> 502.24
yeah

502.4 --> 506.96
he addressed me in pretty high regard

504.8 --> 510.72
and yeah i really appreciate that i've

506.96 --> 513.4399999999999
been like kind of critical about things

510.72 --> 515.12
he does things very analytical but yeah

513.44 --> 516.32
always tried to emphasize i do think

515.12 --> 517.44
he's a good guy he's just

516.32 --> 520.7600000000001
[Music]

517.44 --> 520.7600000000001
just martin

520.8 --> 525.5989999999999
uh

522.32 --> 525.599
well that was pretty cool and

526.0 --> 530.48
typical

527.44 --> 530.48
latter day night show

533.279 --> 535.8389999999999
right

541.04 --> 545.0799999999999
also a quantum of conscience did it like

543.6 --> 547.279
a

545.08 --> 550.72
re-clarification video about the not

547.279 --> 550.72
nail system interesting

555.839 --> 560.6400000000001
i don't really like that terminology but

557.839 --> 563.6800000000001
it's his thing and i get it

560.64 --> 565.4399999999999
it's good to have that like re-clarified

563.68 --> 567.76
uh

565.44 --> 570.24
right other than that i kind of

567.76 --> 572.399
continued watching blake seven i put

570.24 --> 574.48
that on hold a while ago

572.399 --> 576.48
when i'm continuing watching it's like

574.48 --> 579.76
now the like the the second half the

576.48 --> 581.839
post blake phase

579.76 --> 583.92
and that part's actually really

581.839 --> 586.5600000000001
interesting

583.92 --> 588.16
and it's like even the new characters

586.56 --> 593.4399999999999
that basically

588.16 --> 595.68
the new cast they're kind of better

593.44 --> 597.36
like the whole chemistry is like working

595.68 --> 599.04
better

597.36 --> 600.5600000000001
it's interesting

599.04 --> 603.04
and yeah

600.56 --> 604.959
it's just good to watch that back like

603.04 --> 608.0
because the second half is just so

604.959 --> 611.04
different from the first half

608.0 --> 612.24
also like the intro animation changes

611.04 --> 616.76
and everything

612.24 --> 616.76
but yeah continue watching that

620.88 --> 623.2
uh

623.92 --> 627.1999999999999
oh yeah owen benjamin

627.279 --> 632.24
finished watching the friday stream now

629.839 --> 635.44
this saturday stream he's on mandela

632.24 --> 638.48
effect i got like

635.44 --> 643.0790000000001
like was it 20 minutes in and then

638.48 --> 643.0790000000001
i'm gonna watch the rest later

647.2 --> 650.88
but yeah it's good to be on the same

649.12 --> 652.8
side i definitely think that owen

650.88 --> 655.8389999999999
benjamin thinks about the mandela effect

652.8 --> 659.12
the same way that i do

655.839 --> 661.0400000000001
nothing he really says contradicts it so

659.12 --> 663.12
and he even emphasizes it's

661.04 --> 664.88
psychological

663.12 --> 669.04
which

664.88 --> 669.04
in my current assessment is correct

671.76 --> 675.36
and yeah

672.959 --> 677.92
and interested to see how that further

675.36 --> 677.92
develops

687.68 --> 694.399
yeah akumovirus i know you feel like

689.839 --> 694.399
that one guy that sits at the table

694.64 --> 702.24
you're the one glober in class

698.64 --> 706.3199999999999
but you know how to behave

702.24 --> 706.32
but it's still a bit awkward i know it's

708.24 --> 710.9590000000001
yeah let's not

711.04 --> 715.92
reference

712.72 --> 718.24
certain situations in 100 years or more

715.92 --> 718.24
ago

718.399 --> 722.639
but

719.36 --> 725.279
yeah in this case you are glober

722.639 --> 727.2
you're sitting there and

725.279 --> 730.0
yeah you're a good boy but it's still

727.2 --> 731.279
everybody's still kind of suspicious and

730.0 --> 735.24
so

731.279 --> 735.24
what do you expect you know

745.92 --> 752.8
right now not that good

749.68 --> 752.8
hey singing star wars

754.48 --> 759.12
oh yeah the movie about the oxford

757.04 --> 761.519
dictionary yeah i've seen that what is

759.12 --> 761.519
it again

763.92 --> 767.5999999999999
what's the name again

766.16 --> 769.68
i don't remember the name i just

767.6 --> 771.519
remember that's an

769.68 --> 774.2399999999999
a movie

771.519 --> 776.48
really awesome

774.24 --> 776.48
uh

782.72 --> 787.0400000000001
what was the name again seeking

785.12 --> 789.04
professor and the madman yeah that's it

787.04 --> 791.1999999999999
yeah yeah

789.04 --> 793.279
weird name by the way for a movie like

791.2 --> 794.1600000000001
that but

793.279 --> 796.56
i think

794.16 --> 798.959
i might re-watch that because i just

796.56 --> 800.93
remember it was really interesting and

798.959 --> 802.3199999999999
yeah

800.93 --> 804.56
[Music]

802.32 --> 804.5600000000001
right

807.839 --> 811.44
luke warm globes

811.839 --> 815.1600000000001
hey kevlar

890.88 --> 894.16

891.92 --> 894.16
cool

895.839 --> 900.32
the dell has like a lot of followers

906.48 --> 910.24
and he's always like had that so

910.48 --> 915.839
but yeah he's he's an interesting

913.44 --> 915.839
thinker

917.12 --> 921.519
and he's like grown a lot i think

922.8 --> 928.639
but yeah so have i

926.32 --> 929.519
but he has a lot of following

928.639 --> 933.36
me

929.519 --> 935.6
i don't know not so much maybe

933.36 --> 936.88
then again i am not like the most

935.6 --> 939.88
eloquent

936.88 --> 939.88
entertainer

941.839 --> 945.759
lots of silent pauses and all that

947.92 --> 952.679
what

949.52 --> 952.679
[Music]

954.8 --> 960.3599999999999
if the chat's flowing then usually so is

957.12 --> 960.36
my mouth

971.36 --> 975.759
it says it how it is yeah yeah just the

973.519 --> 980.399
directness

975.759 --> 980.399
have you been streaming yeah celsius

980.839 --> 986.1600000000001
uh arguably

983.759 --> 987.04
as long as dell has

986.16 --> 989.68
although

987.04 --> 989.68
like dell

991.199 --> 995.8389999999999
probably started a bit earlier that i

993.6 --> 997.6800000000001
don't know i don't know exactly when he

995.839 --> 999.6800000000001
started doing that i think it's like in

997.68 --> 1001.92
the first wave even

999.68 --> 1001.92
so

1005.92 --> 1011.639
but yeah i've been streaming for a long

1007.6 --> 1011.639
time since 2016

1012.959 --> 1018.7199999999999
i mean this is my

1016.199 --> 1020.88
1271st episode

1018.72 --> 1025.079
of this show

1020.88 --> 1025.079
i've been doing this for a while

1025.42 --> 1028.479
[Music]

1043.839 --> 1050.52
yes though yeah he's he's really good

1046.559 --> 1050.52
with students and all that

1052.88 --> 1058.3200000000002
like he he just finds this energy

1055.52 --> 1060.72
position that's like ideal like he's

1058.32 --> 1063.12
he's really feeling like their father or

1060.72 --> 1066.4
something right

1063.12 --> 1068.1599999999999
i mean i have that a little when i do it

1066.4 --> 1070.96
i've just never really done that on

1068.16 --> 1073.8400000000001
camera it's always been like

1070.96 --> 1073.8400000000001
more private

1074.0 --> 1078.48
to me

1076.32 --> 1081.84
like i don't know i've never tried

1078.48 --> 1084.88
like doing that on camera

1081.84 --> 1084.8799999999999
like face to face

1084.96 --> 1091.72
i barely even bring such things up with

1088.16 --> 1091.72
people out there

1107.84 --> 1114.0
but yeah if i happen to be somewhere

1111.44 --> 1116.3200000000002
and i pick up on the conversation and i

1114.0 --> 1118.72
notice there's issues then i might just

1116.32 --> 1123.72
get involved i kind of do butt in

1118.72 --> 1123.72
conversations i tend to do that

1126.16 --> 1130.64
that can be a dangerous proposition

1130.799 --> 1132.96
well

1134.64 --> 1138.96
yeah i mean this is the netherlands

1139.2 --> 1143.8400000000001
there's like a lot of like media people

1142.16 --> 1145.76
and they

1143.84 --> 1148.32
they really

1145.76 --> 1150.48
don't give flat earth there's a break

1148.32 --> 1153.8799999999999
ever

1150.48 --> 1153.88
a lot of them

1167.52 --> 1172.16
i don't know it all depends on where

1169.76 --> 1174.8799999999999
you're at what kind of people you bump

1172.16 --> 1178.039
into what typically hangs around in such

1174.88 --> 1178.0390000000002
a place

1190.16 --> 1195.1200000000001
oh it's weird though i do think that

1192.48 --> 1198.16
there are some people now

1195.12 --> 1200.2399999999998
here in my city that have actually like

1198.16 --> 1202.799
took notice of me they have figured out

1200.24 --> 1206.52
that i am here doing this and they

1202.799 --> 1206.52
recognize me

1206.88 --> 1212.72
because i have had just some people that

1208.88 --> 1213.5200000000002
have never seen before that are like hey

1212.72 --> 1215.84
hi

1213.52 --> 1215.84
okay

1216.48 --> 1223.039
and like that started happening

1220.88 --> 1223.0390000000002
like

1223.36 --> 1230.9599999999998
pretty recently

1226.32 --> 1233.12
right but i am just the the thing is

1230.96 --> 1235.3600000000001
out there

1233.12 --> 1237.76
i'm just not like this oh yeah let's

1235.36 --> 1239.9189999999999
have a conversation i'm like

1237.76 --> 1241.76
kind of more like a buddhist almost

1239.919 --> 1244.88
where i'm just like no i'm just going

1241.76 --> 1244.8799999999999
about my business and

1245.36 --> 1249.1999999999998
i am dynamic i can't respond and

1247.679 --> 1252.0
interact

1249.2 --> 1254.0
but i'm just like on a mission

1252.0 --> 1254.88
doing whatever i'm doing and i'm not

1254.0 --> 1257.6
like

1254.88 --> 1259.7600000000002
hanging around and just like oh hey a

1257.6 --> 1260.84
person let's just

1259.76 --> 1264.1589999999999
talk to

1260.84 --> 1266.24
them i don't know maybe that's like

1264.159 --> 1268.0
my genetics or something

1266.24 --> 1270.72
but i've always

1268.0 --> 1272.24
just never really had that impulse for

1270.72 --> 1276.0
some reason

1272.24 --> 1278.799
unless i'm like super enthusiastic on

1276.0 --> 1282.0
fire and feel extremely safe

1278.799 --> 1284.24
and then i get more hyperactive

1282.0 --> 1287.6
and then i'll just like

1284.24 --> 1290.72
just straight out talk to people

1287.6 --> 1291.84
to like uncomfortable levels even

1290.72 --> 1293.6000000000001
like that

1291.84 --> 1296.24
then happens

1293.6 --> 1299.36
right but it's only under very specific

1296.24 --> 1303.039
circumstances where i'm like in a group

1299.36 --> 1305.36
like a class or a course or something

1303.039 --> 1308.0
activity and then i'm like oh i think i

1305.36 --> 1310.32
figured it out now how this works

1308.0 --> 1315.32
and then i can get a bit loose but in

1310.32 --> 1315.32
general that doesn't really happen

1323.36 --> 1326.08
it's yeah

1326.559 --> 1330.6789999999999
it just works a little differently

1332.159 --> 1337.6000000000001
right but hey here online

1334.799 --> 1339.039
i am basically in that circumstance to a

1337.6 --> 1340.37
certain degree

1339.039 --> 1342.08
because i'm used to

1340.37 --> 1344.9599999999998
[Music]

1342.08 --> 1347.6789999999999
the internet and my channel how things

1344.96 --> 1348.72
go and like what i even am

1347.679 --> 1351.919
here

1348.72 --> 1354.159
and even here when i do this all this my

1351.919 --> 1356.96
show

1354.159 --> 1358.96
well like i just described right

1356.96 --> 1360.559
once i feel comfortable i get more

1358.96 --> 1364.0
hyperactive

1360.559 --> 1366.6399999999999
more energetic and more direct to

1364.0 --> 1368.4
uncomfortable levels i do that in person

1366.64 --> 1370.7990000000002
and i'm doing that here and i have been

1368.4 --> 1375.039
doing that here for quite a while

1370.799 --> 1376.24
right but that's not the default

1375.039 --> 1378.799
position

1376.24 --> 1381.679
that i take

1378.799 --> 1384.679
that only happens like once i'm like

1381.679 --> 1384.679
settled

1389.84 --> 1396.72
and like have the trust like yes there's

1392.559 --> 1400.24
a dynamic here if i show myself

1396.72 --> 1402.559
like that would be accepted

1400.24 --> 1404.96
because people yeah because it's like

1402.559 --> 1408.32
the time and the place for it and that's

1404.96 --> 1410.559
super elusive you can only feel it out

1408.32 --> 1410.559
right

1414.32 --> 1418.8799999999999
right and usually from that point on you

1416.559 --> 1421.2
have to defend that you have to uphold

1418.88 --> 1423.919
it otherwise it might fail it might be

1421.2 --> 1426.88
off tone and then i retreat again and

1423.919 --> 1429.44
then i'm like nope nope i'll hang around

1426.88 --> 1433.2
but i'm not gonna say anything anymore

1429.44 --> 1433.2
because it's not clicking

1434.96 --> 1438.72
it's weird i even have that like with

1437.039 --> 1440.8799999999999
one of my roommates

1438.72 --> 1443.84
who is kind of a nice girl it's not the

1440.88 --> 1445.7600000000002
one that i really like

1443.84 --> 1447.84
like a couple of times

1445.76 --> 1448.96
like i like i for the way i've heard her

1447.84 --> 1451.6789999999999
talk

1448.96 --> 1453.6000000000001
about things and she addressed me once

1451.679 --> 1456.159
like you have to get a covet test

1453.6 --> 1458.0
because i was this and that was like

1456.159 --> 1462.5590000000002
bang

1458.0 --> 1465.36
like that was the final straw like

1462.559 --> 1467.52
that if somebody is so unconscious that

1465.36 --> 1470.6399999999999
they allow themselves to dig that deep

1467.52 --> 1471.6
and then face me and tell me to be part

1470.64 --> 1473.1200000000001
of that

1471.6 --> 1475.039
that's like a

1473.12 --> 1477.52
grand error

1475.039 --> 1480.0
and after that point i basically don't

1477.52 --> 1483.679
feel i can trust that person again

1480.0 --> 1485.679
until they prove that they recognize

1483.679 --> 1488.64
how severe

1485.679 --> 1490.5590000000002
the default the mistake was

1488.64 --> 1492.3200000000002
and they probably never get to that

1490.559 --> 1494.32
point because they're already slided

1492.32 --> 1496.72
that far right and then i just

1494.32 --> 1500.6399999999999
disconnect and then like i always say

1496.72 --> 1502.24
hello i'm always polite i'm helpful

1500.64 --> 1505.919
but i don't

1502.24 --> 1505.919
feel like communicating with her

1508.159 --> 1512.72
because it's just like i feel like this

1510.24 --> 1515.039
is not gonna work

1512.72 --> 1517.52
it's like it's not going to last there's

1515.039 --> 1519.36
no build up there's there's no cohesion

1517.52 --> 1522.6399999999999
that i could build with

1519.36 --> 1524.0
with the somebody in that state of mind

1522.64 --> 1526.3200000000002
right

1524.0 --> 1527.52
but she definitely knows i mean or no

1526.32 --> 1529.84
harm

1527.52 --> 1529.84
absolutely

1530.88 --> 1534.96
right anyway some

1533.36 --> 1538.08
personal

1534.96 --> 1538.08
social mechanics

1538.64 --> 1542.48
and yes susie as it is all about being

1540.799 --> 1546.0
comfortable

1542.48 --> 1548.48
but also like comfortable is like

1546.0 --> 1551.2
your state right what you're in but you

1548.48 --> 1553.6
also like there needs to be

1551.2 --> 1557.279
a possibility to connect

1553.6 --> 1559.9189999999999
like somebody needs to be prepared for

1557.279 --> 1563.679
an extra load

1559.919 --> 1563.679
of like personal information

1564.24 --> 1568.72
and it needs to

1566.0 --> 1571.12
find a place and be able to settle with

1568.72 --> 1573.3600000000001
the person right

1571.12 --> 1575.12
and if you feel out that they're then

1573.36 --> 1577.36
like they're just chilling up and

1575.12 --> 1579.6
they're like yeah

1577.36 --> 1582.1589999999999
but they're like freaked out then you

1579.6 --> 1585.84
know like okay

1582.159 --> 1587.7600000000002
there's no place there

1585.84 --> 1591.6
they can't handle me

1587.76 --> 1591.6
that's basically what it comes down to

1596.159 --> 1602.6190000000001
hello by the way gadgets inspector

1599.45 --> 1602.6190000000001
[Music]

1606.559 --> 1609.559
um

1628.24 --> 1633.679
it's okay to be vulnerable shows you let

1630.96 --> 1636.48
go of that pesky ego

1633.679 --> 1638.3200000000002
right but it has to be safe though i

1636.48 --> 1640.559
mean if you let go

1638.32 --> 1642.8799999999999
and somebody else's ego is like

1640.559 --> 1644.48
immediately like oh

1642.88 --> 1647.1200000000001
oh

1644.48 --> 1649.44
oh that means that i can dominate then

1647.12 --> 1649.4399999999998
yeah

1649.84 --> 1655.84
so

1651.84 --> 1655.84
you have to actually be able to

1656.64 --> 1662.72
get the feeling that somebody can be

1658.88 --> 1662.72
trusted to let that go

1663.12 --> 1667.36
that they're not gonna

1665.039 --> 1669.6
use your vulnerability

1667.36 --> 1672.08
that kind of dominate or gain control

1669.6 --> 1672.08
somehow

1672.9 --> 1676.0890000000002
[Music]

1678.72 --> 1684.72
yeah again inspector i'm doing

1680.84 --> 1687.279
fine a bit poor but

1684.72 --> 1689.2
managing thanks to

1687.279 --> 1691.039
donation from somebody i don't know who

1689.2 --> 1693.3400000000001
was yesterday

1691.039 --> 1696.4
hey elise g

1693.34 --> 1696.3999999999999
[Music]

1717.679 --> 1720.96
right

1718.64 --> 1723.44
but yeah i'd like to compare a bit of

1720.96 --> 1725.76
dell with me since he says just let go

1723.44 --> 1728.0800000000002
of that pesky ego well for him that's

1725.76 --> 1730.72
gonna work great you know why

1728.08 --> 1735.039
because he's kind of a

1730.72 --> 1736.64
big guy with tattoos and like a

1735.039 --> 1740.0
that face

1736.64 --> 1742.72
you know like nobody's gonna be like oh

1740.0 --> 1745.2
oh i'm going to dominate him now because

1742.72 --> 1747.52
they'll feel like yeah that's gonna end

1745.2 --> 1749.76
very badly for you just look at the way

1747.52 --> 1750.8799999999999
it looks

1749.76 --> 1753.76
right

1750.88 --> 1757.1200000000001
so he can do that

1753.76 --> 1758.799
he's less at risk like i i don't look

1757.12 --> 1759.76
that butch

1758.799 --> 1762.559
okay

1759.76 --> 1765.52
i mean if i raise my voice and all that

1762.559 --> 1766.96
yeah i can be pretty impressive

1765.52 --> 1769.2
right

1766.96 --> 1769.2
but

1769.679 --> 1775.8400000000001
i don't have like that

1771.76 --> 1779.279
natural like gorilla type feel to me so

1775.84 --> 1782.9599999999998
people do actually have hot spot towards

1779.279 --> 1785.6
me and are like oh oh so that means i

1782.96 --> 1785.6000000000001
can like

1786.08 --> 1788.6399999999999
do that

1788.96 --> 1793.039
and i've experienced that a lot in my

1791.919 --> 1795.1200000000001
life

1793.039 --> 1796.08
and it's been quite a struggle basically

1795.12 --> 1798.399
getting

1796.08 --> 1800.76
out from underneath that it's been a

1798.399 --> 1803.6789999999999
really big struggle

1800.76 --> 1806.24
[Music]

1803.679 --> 1808.96
and i'm kind of still dealing with it

1806.24 --> 1812.159
for example over at the flat earth

1808.96 --> 1814.159
debate sometimes the guys feel like they

1812.159 --> 1816.88
can do that although they

1814.159 --> 1817.679
it's in a certain type of moment

1816.88 --> 1820.3990000000001
and

1817.679 --> 1822.0
like when the when i'm low energy or

1820.399 --> 1824.0
like things are going wrong then

1822.0 --> 1825.6
suddenly they get these impulses like

1824.0 --> 1828.32
they could do that it's highly

1825.6 --> 1828.32
disruptive

1829.12 --> 1836.32
so it i'm always followed around by that

1833.679 --> 1837.6000000000001
i don't think dell has that issue

1836.32 --> 1840.72
because he just

1837.6 --> 1840.7199999999998
looks badass

1843.88 --> 1848.18
[Music]

1848.72 --> 1852.96
his brain is his fizz yeah

1850.96 --> 1855.2
what

1852.96 --> 1858.0
he has like

1855.2 --> 1860.159
done some work some updating in his mind

1858.0 --> 1862.08
absolutely

1860.159 --> 1864.7990000000002
he's much better than he was like when

1862.08 --> 1866.24
it is when this all started five years

1864.799 --> 1868.559
ago

1866.24 --> 1868.559
six

1868.96 --> 1873.919
he's much stronger and more focused now

1871.919 --> 1874.64
like a lot more

1873.919 --> 1878.44
so

1874.64 --> 1878.44
he has grown in that

1888.64 --> 1899.42
hey terror306 good to see you

1893.26 --> 1899.42
[Music]

1930.399 --> 1933.36
right anyway

1934.91 --> 1937.959
[Music]

1938.559 --> 1943.8799999999999
i'm retired not dead

1940.88 --> 1943.88
what

1962.559 --> 1966.08
looks like somebody that can be in the

1964.159 --> 1969.6000000000001
slapping competitions

1966.08 --> 1969.6
that's hilarious akumu

1970.399 --> 1973.5189999999998
he probably could

1975.2 --> 1980.96
but he he's probably at this point

1978.0 --> 1983.36
thinks i think that's really silly and

1980.96 --> 1983.3600000000001
it is

1984.399 --> 1988.1589999999999
any sign of rumpus doing his test this

1986.48 --> 1992.799
year i don't know i haven't heard from

1988.159 --> 1992.7990000000002
rumpus in like a year or more so

1993.36 --> 1997.84
but i don't think he's ever gonna

1995.519 --> 2000.799
finally show us

1997.84 --> 2002.1589999999999
the presentation he's 99.9

2000.799 --> 2004.399
ready with

2002.159 --> 2007.3600000000001
that he was going to do in 2017 about

2004.399 --> 2008.2399999999998
the geometric horizon at the isle of man

2007.36 --> 2012.24
yeah

2008.24 --> 2012.24
he's still working on it allegedly

2015.12 --> 2022.3999999999999
and he's on bev's oh okay

2018.88 --> 2025.439
well i don't really hang around bev so

2022.4 --> 2025.439
[Music]

2031.279 --> 2037.039
yep some things change

2034.159 --> 2039.2800000000002
some things never change

2037.039 --> 2040.48
but some things do

2039.28 --> 2043.9189999999999
[Music]

2040.48 --> 2047.44
like rompus never changes

2043.919 --> 2049.76
but our knowledge of how things work

2047.44 --> 2049.76
does

2051.44 --> 2056.48
he probably found out the earth dude no

2054.159 --> 2059.359
letters said no you don't understand i

2056.48 --> 2061.839
mean that guy is

2059.359 --> 2061.839
religious

2062.159 --> 2067.28
like he knows the earth is flat he's

2064.639 --> 2070.159
known it pretty much from the start

2067.28 --> 2074.159
and he's actively compartmentalized

2070.159 --> 2077.44
himself to continue without knowing that

2074.159 --> 2080.2400000000002
it is flat even though he uses that

2077.44 --> 2081.2000000000003
i know what that is because

2080.24 --> 2083.919
i

2081.2 --> 2083.919
did that

2084.96 --> 2090.7200000000003
like 20 years ago

2087.52 --> 2093.359
i was like rumpus in many ways except

2090.72 --> 2096.0789999999997
not patronizing right

2093.359 --> 2100.4
never patronizing

2096.079 --> 2100.4
i was more like a just a

2100.839 --> 2103.44
robot

2102.4 --> 2104.96
just

2103.44 --> 2106.7200000000003
figuring it out

2104.96 --> 2108.96
it's like baldwin

2106.72 --> 2111.359
right but i know how that works and

2108.96 --> 2114.56
rumpus is doing it too he's just not

2111.359 --> 2117.52
being honest to himself in the world

2114.56 --> 2120.56
that he knows it's flat and that he uses

2117.52 --> 2122.48
that knowledge in constructing his

2120.56 --> 2126.48
machinations to reinforce his ball

2122.48 --> 2129.96
religion so he is a truly religious man

2126.48 --> 2129.96
truly religious

2134.24 --> 2138.1189999999997
as in bold religious

2155.68 --> 2159.839
what the hell borders boy

2163.359 --> 2168.7999999999997
i may do

2166.0 --> 2168.8
potentially

2168.88 --> 2174.6400000000003
borders boy and i'm not gonna elaborate

2171.2 --> 2174.64
on that it's

2176.32 --> 2179.839
jesus

2178.32 --> 2183.119
oh thanks

2179.839 --> 2185.52
thanks no yeah oh that's not

2183.119 --> 2188.079
gonna turn the mood at all

2185.52 --> 2188.079
jesus

2196.88 --> 2200.4
it's what i did in the past it's really

2199.28 --> 2201.52
dark

2200.4 --> 2203.52
it's

2201.52 --> 2205.52
like i'm

2203.52 --> 2208.64
better than everybody else and if

2205.52 --> 2211.839
somebody's in a bad spot like really

2208.64 --> 2214.8799999999997
existential spiritual crisis you push

2211.839 --> 2218.0789999999997
them super hard

2214.88 --> 2219.28
and even like yeah abused my inside of

2218.079 --> 2220.4
people

2219.28 --> 2223.28
to like

2220.4 --> 2224.96
basically ram them into maximum

2223.28 --> 2228.8
depression

2224.96 --> 2230.64
that sort of thing it's evil like it's

2228.8 --> 2232.5600000000004
worse than some of what these trolls

2230.64 --> 2234.96
here try to attempt

2232.56 --> 2239.68
right but it doesn't work like that

2234.96 --> 2241.76
it's dark it's evil i don't ever

2239.68 --> 2246.64
ever want to catch myself doing anything

2241.76 --> 2246.6400000000003
like that ever again it's so sickening

2246.8 --> 2248.96
so

2251.28 --> 2254.96
i don't know if they actually like

2252.96 --> 2255.76
committed suicide

2254.96 --> 2258.079
but

2255.76 --> 2259.92
i made it back to the level where they

2258.079 --> 2262.48
could have

2259.92 --> 2264.4
like i wasn't like

2262.48 --> 2266.96
like a real

2264.4 --> 2269.44
psychopath type that's like oh i'm gonna

2266.96 --> 2271.119
like pick out my victims and then like

2269.44 --> 2274.56
see what happens

2271.119 --> 2277.2000000000003
no i was just like in the moment

2274.56 --> 2280.56
allowing the darkness to get really

2277.2 --> 2282.7999999999997
constant like it's like just dark magic

2280.56 --> 2285.839
out of pure arrogance

2282.8 --> 2285.8390000000004
and for nothing

2288.48 --> 2292.0
that's

2289.359 --> 2293.04
what i kind of used to do not all the

2292.0 --> 2294.64
time

2293.04 --> 2297.359
sometimes

2294.64 --> 2300.3199999999997
and it was like really dark

2297.359 --> 2305.119
like i've seen people's faces look at me

2300.32 --> 2307.04
with like really like scared and disgust

2305.119 --> 2311.119
and that was real

2307.04 --> 2313.839
and that's terrifying to realize that

2311.119 --> 2313.839
afterward

2314.51 --> 2317.639
[Music]

2323.359 --> 2327.24
hello mark by the way

2327.92 --> 2333.2000000000003
yeah doing great weather is is still

2331.04 --> 2336.4
good there are some chemtrails though

2333.2 --> 2336.3999999999996
unfortunately again but

2336.72 --> 2343.24
so

2338.96 --> 2343.2400000000002
is that it borders boy

2375.359 --> 2378.96
thanks for sharing okay

2379.2 --> 2384.24
the weird thing is is that i basically

2381.68 --> 2386.8799999999997
went by sort of a freemason

2384.24 --> 2389.2799999999997
philosophy thing or satanic or whatever

2386.88 --> 2392.7200000000003
you you can call it and it is like if

2389.28 --> 2394.48
you just push somebody to the maximum

2392.72 --> 2396.8799999999997
of your capacity

2394.48 --> 2399.68
then either they die

2396.88 --> 2402.6400000000003
and they fail or they become stronger

2399.68 --> 2402.64
than ever before

2403.68 --> 2405.5989999999997
right

2404.88 --> 2407.6800000000003
but

2405.599 --> 2409.599
just having that knowledge doesn't

2407.68 --> 2411.2799999999997
actually

2409.599 --> 2414.6400000000003
mean anything

2411.28 --> 2417.2000000000003
if you don't really care

2414.64 --> 2420.0789999999997
so it was just fueled really internally

2417.2 --> 2422.24
by pure arrogance not by like

2420.079 --> 2424.319
i care about you so i'm gonna push you

2422.24 --> 2426.8799999999997
to the max until you get it right

2424.319 --> 2429.68
because that's a very different

2426.88 --> 2431.44
angle of approach with the energy i mean

2429.68 --> 2433.5989999999997
that can be good that's how good

2431.44 --> 2436.0
teachers do it are really

2433.599 --> 2438.56
focused parents they get serious they

2436.0 --> 2439.839
get straight to the core and they like

2438.56 --> 2442.48
don't

2439.839 --> 2445.599
don't sugarcoat things right

2442.48 --> 2448.88
but that's good because it's fueled by

2445.599 --> 2451.44
care i was just like

2448.88 --> 2453.2000000000003
i see all this [ __ ] about you oh you did

2451.44 --> 2456.7200000000003
something stupid well here's what's

2453.2 --> 2461.5989999999997
gonna happen like but

2456.72 --> 2461.5989999999997
like they didn't actually deserve it

2464.319 --> 2466.56
like

2465.68 --> 2470.0
or

2466.56 --> 2472.0789999999997
it's so complicated

2470.0 --> 2473.44
it's like i don't even remember the

2472.079 --> 2475.92
details

2473.44 --> 2477.28
of people that i did that to i just

2475.92 --> 2479.76
remember

2477.28 --> 2481.92
how i did it

2479.76 --> 2485.3590000000004
and that's the thing that's like staring

2481.92 --> 2485.359
me in the face now still

2489.92 --> 2495.76
even like decades

2492.839 --> 2498.56
later like that part how i did it is

2495.76 --> 2500.5600000000004
haunting me like the individuals i don't

2498.56 --> 2501.7599999999998
even know who they are

2500.56 --> 2504.24
anymore

2501.76 --> 2506.4
if i even ever knew them sometimes i

2504.24 --> 2509.7599999999998
just did that with people

2506.4 --> 2511.44
like that would randomly bump into like

2509.76 --> 2512.48
the group that i was hanging with or

2511.44 --> 2514.079
something

2512.48 --> 2516.96
like they've never seen before would

2514.079 --> 2518.48
never see again and i just did that sort

2516.96 --> 2521.839
of [ __ ]

2518.48 --> 2524.72
using my divining power to like

2521.839 --> 2526.4
instantly figure out things also i

2524.72 --> 2528.24
abused it

2526.4 --> 2529.119
it's terrible

2528.24 --> 2533.9199999999996
and i

2529.119 --> 2536.8
only barely even consciously did that

2533.92 --> 2539.28
just did these things almost on reflex

2536.8 --> 2541.599
but yeah then again i was in like a

2539.28 --> 2543.44
pretty insecure position overall so i

2541.599 --> 2548.6400000000003
was constantly just

2543.44 --> 2548.64
like being aggressive to be defensive

2548.96 --> 2555.359
as well it's ah god it's so dude i was

2552.319 --> 2555.359
so different

2555.839 --> 2560.2799999999997
so different from what i am now

2564.8 --> 2571.28
anyway i'll stop boring you with my

2568.64 --> 2573.7599999999998
introspective

2571.28 --> 2573.76
[ __ ]

2576.8 --> 2580.4
so you can continue talking about the

2579.119 --> 2584.839
weather and

2580.4 --> 2584.839
how a kumu virus is an idiot

2585.3 --> 2589.929
[Music]

2622.36 --> 2627.849
[Music]

2632.4 --> 2637.04
you know i can still i'm still gonna

2634.88 --> 2639.28
reflect on it since this discussion is

2637.04 --> 2642.16
kind of nonsense you guys are having no

2639.28 --> 2642.1600000000003
offense meant but

2642.88 --> 2646.4
part of the arrogance that was fueling

2644.8 --> 2650.7200000000003
it is that

2646.4 --> 2650.7200000000003
i just wanted to use my power

2651.2 --> 2656.0789999999997
the power that i'm using right now right

2653.599 --> 2659.839
but i'm using it responsibly right now

2656.079 --> 2661.52
back then i just wanted to use it i

2659.839 --> 2662.56
didn't care

2661.52 --> 2665.52
really

2662.56 --> 2667.52
i wanted to use it i wanted to use it in

2665.52 --> 2671.839
a way that it wouldn't lose it

2667.52 --> 2671.839
but i still didn't really care

2672.88 --> 2676.8
and that's

2674.4 --> 2679.6800000000003
the difference

2676.8 --> 2683.119
i've learned in all that time like

2679.68 --> 2687.359
if you don't care and you stick to that

2683.119 --> 2687.359
then the power eventually like

2688.24 --> 2693.2
some yeah it makes you dark

2691.52 --> 2694.16
because then you're just going to abuse

2693.2 --> 2697.04
it

2694.16 --> 2697.04
for your whims

2698.16 --> 2702.96
and now i've become ex yeah very much

2701.28 --> 2706.4
the opposite of that

2702.96 --> 2708.8
i take every power response with great

2706.4 --> 2710.7200000000003
responsibility like every power even the

2708.8 --> 2713.04
ones that everybody just takes for

2710.72 --> 2716.2799999999997
granted doesn't even consciously realize

2713.04 --> 2716.2799999999997
it's there

2718.5 --> 2722.8
[Music]

2720.4 --> 2725.28
was that guy in oakley's the other day i

2722.8 --> 2728.1600000000003
don't know gadget inspector

2725.28 --> 2731.0400000000004
he was new but he also did he do i don't

2728.16 --> 2733.839
think he was a real pilot

2731.04 --> 2736.96
i mean i think he was a

2733.839 --> 2738.64
an actor that was probably instructed by

2736.96 --> 2740.64
wolfie and all that

2738.64 --> 2743.44
about some basics

2740.64 --> 2746.64
probably had some lists maybe

2743.44 --> 2747.44
a little ear

2746.64 --> 2750.96
right

2747.44 --> 2754.8
but he was no pilot like nothing he said

2750.96 --> 2754.8
actually proved he was a pilot

2759.839 --> 2766.16
like he only had theoretical basics

2763.52 --> 2766.96
he did not have the right impulses

2766.16 --> 2770.0789999999997
that

2766.96 --> 2772.8
like a real pilot would have

2770.079 --> 2775.3590000000004
which like they have pride

2772.8 --> 2776.48
he didn't show any he didn't

2775.359 --> 2777.359
have any

2776.48 --> 2779.839
like

2777.359 --> 2782.16
like hey hold on here

2779.839 --> 2785.2799999999997
right

2782.16 --> 2788.56
no never so it's not a pilot i just know

2785.28 --> 2791.119
i know what a pilot is like i've met

2788.56 --> 2791.119
pilots

2792.079 --> 2795.76
jesuit guy was one actually

2795.92 --> 2800.8
and

2798.24 --> 2803.2799999999997
they always act in a way

2800.8 --> 2807.8
this guy was not acting in that way he

2803.28 --> 2807.8
is no pilot i know he isn't

2885.76 --> 2892.6400000000003
i'm glad you're doing so good

2888.559 --> 2897.0400000000004
then again you've got a big ass house so

2892.64 --> 2897.04
you probably are doing fairly well

2898.88 --> 2904.28
thank you very much man i really

2900.559 --> 2904.28
appreciate that support

2916.079 --> 2920.2400000000002
it's level out there yeah seeking spare

2917.92 --> 2920.2400000000002
water

2923.76 --> 2929.8390000000004
i think on average most pilots are like

2927.359 --> 2932.72
aware

2929.839 --> 2935.52
it's like yeah ball earth oh yeah sure

2932.72 --> 2937.9199999999996
sure but i'm just gonna

2935.52 --> 2940.0
go about how i've learned to fly here

2937.92 --> 2943.28
and yeah the instruments pretty much say

2940.0 --> 2945.2
it's level and stationary but

2943.28 --> 2948.079
if they say it's a ball

2945.2 --> 2950.5589999999997
fine whatever i'm not gonna get involved

2948.079 --> 2950.559
with that

2953.28 --> 2956.7200000000003
right they don't wanna get all that

2955.44 --> 2959.44
nagging

2956.72 --> 2959.4399999999996
on their ass

2960.079 --> 2963.6800000000003
i mean being a professional pilot is

2962.4 --> 2967.599
usually a

2963.68 --> 2968.3999999999996
stressful enough job as it is without

2967.599 --> 2970.559
like

2968.4 --> 2971.92
religious fanatics

2970.559 --> 2973.2000000000003
haunting you

2971.92 --> 2976.2000000000003
constantly

2973.2 --> 2976.2
so

2986.4 --> 2990.4
i'll get back to work all right luigi

2988.64 --> 2993.1189999999997
thank you thank you for the paypal

2990.4 --> 2996.079
donation i really appreciate it and yeah

2993.119 --> 2996.079
have a good work day

2996.319 --> 3000.8
on sunday hmm

2998.88 --> 3002.42
garden work probably

3000.8 --> 3007.52
right

3002.42 --> 3009.119
[Music]

3007.52 --> 3010.0
told me that they don't correct we're

3009.119 --> 3012.4
gonna

3010.0 --> 3014.72
okay gadget inspector it would be really

3012.4 --> 3015.92
weird if they did say that

3014.72 --> 3019.359
because

3015.92 --> 3021.2000000000003
how do you do that

3019.359 --> 3023.119
it's been my question during that whole

3021.2 --> 3025.1189999999997
show how

3023.119 --> 3026.4
how are you going to correct for korea

3025.119 --> 3029.28
are you gonna correct

3026.4 --> 3031.839
for an apparent deviation

3029.28 --> 3034.079
by being in the

3031.839 --> 3036.16
non-moving reference frame how do you

3034.079 --> 3038.319
correct

3036.16 --> 3041.1189999999997
for something that's not happening to

3038.319 --> 3044.0
you but to something else

3041.119 --> 3046.079
how do you correct for the earth turning

3044.0 --> 3048.4
underneath you that like

3046.079 --> 3050.2400000000002
can somebody explain to me how that

3048.4 --> 3052.079
works

3050.24 --> 3054.7999999999997
i doubt it

3052.079 --> 3056.0
because i cannot figure out any

3054.8 --> 3058.559
mechanical

3056.0 --> 3062.64
situation in how you would correct for

3058.559 --> 3064.3190000000004
that other than just needlessly

3062.64 --> 3066.64
like oh going against the spin of the

3064.319 --> 3069.2799999999997
earth

3066.64 --> 3070.96
okay then slow it down going with it oh

3069.28 --> 3073.0400000000004
then

3070.96 --> 3076.079
accelerate

3073.04 --> 3080.44
like why it makes no sense

3076.079 --> 3080.44
makes nothing about that make sense

3097.52 --> 3102.24
don't see why a pilot would correct for

3100.16 --> 3102.24
it

3103.04 --> 3108.16
wind is a bigger factor yeah wind is a

3105.359 --> 3112.72
bigger factor than the earth rotation

3108.16 --> 3112.72
that isn't actually happening i agree

3113.119 --> 3118.4
wind is a factor

3114.8 --> 3119.8390000000004
earth rotating underneath is not

3118.4 --> 3122.079
so yeah of course you don't have to

3119.839 --> 3123.92
correct for it

3122.079 --> 3125.92
i mean you couldn't correct for it that

3123.92 --> 3127.44
was my point if there was an error

3125.92 --> 3130.16
spinning underneath you you wouldn't be

3127.44 --> 3132.4
able to correct for that because you're

3130.16 --> 3132.3999999999996
not

3133.28 --> 3138.96
involved in the thing that's actually

3136.4 --> 3141.839
doing the moving that's why it's a

3138.96 --> 3144.7200000000003
coriolis deflection

3141.839 --> 3147.599
you're not doing anything it's something

3144.72 --> 3148.7999999999997
else that is doing the thing

3147.599 --> 3150.88
the moving

3148.8 --> 3153.28
the spinning earth

3150.88 --> 3157.0
you can't correct for that

3153.28 --> 3157.0
that makes no sense

3173.92 --> 3178.559
once you fly fast headwinds you fly

3176.079 --> 3178.559
slower

3180.559 --> 3187.2000000000003
but yeah those directions are not

3184.319 --> 3190.4
even correlatory

3187.2 --> 3190.3999999999996
with earth rotation

3191.28 --> 3196.0
it all depends like on

3193.28 --> 3199.3590000000004
like what height you are and

3196.0 --> 3199.359
where over the earth

3200.079 --> 3206.079
like that makes no sense

3203.44 --> 3208.96
like the wind is not all moving in the

3206.079 --> 3211.119
same direction it isn't

3208.96 --> 3213.599
it's like one side is going this way the

3211.119 --> 3215.599
other side the other way and it's like

3213.599 --> 3218.6400000000003
and then it like sort of changes around

3215.599 --> 3222.44
sometimes it's like no that's not

3218.64 --> 3222.44
coriolis deviation

3222.48 --> 3230.359
that's just wind turbulence moving all

3225.599 --> 3230.3590000000004
over the place in specific patterns

3264.43 --> 3267.94
[Music]

3276.48 --> 3280.4
yeah good one guardiola all horizontals

3278.799 --> 3282.64
are parallel

3280.4 --> 3282.64
yeah

3283.04 --> 3286.2799999999997
i agree

3292.72 --> 3296.52
hello psychics traveler

3297.49 --> 3300.6899999999996
[Music]

3329.119 --> 3333.2000000000003
yeah no you don't need to post anything

3331.68 --> 3335.44
here

3333.2 --> 3337.4399999999996
like that you're even trying to make a

3335.44 --> 3340.559
case

3337.44 --> 3343.68
or correction of coriolis deviation is

3340.559 --> 3345.44
or or the opposite or anything like no

3343.68 --> 3347.68
we don't need to

3345.44 --> 3349.92
do we don't need your diagrams and

3347.68 --> 3353.52
sources at this point

3349.92 --> 3353.52
we've seen what those are like

3353.839 --> 3357.839
i cannot remember a single time where

3356.24 --> 3359.68
you actually

3357.839 --> 3363.839
ended up being correct with your

3359.68 --> 3363.839
sourcing for the argument

3364.24 --> 3368.319
although yeah do keep trying you know

3366.559 --> 3370.48
keep trying that on the flat earth

3368.319 --> 3372.0
debate i definitely encourage you to

3370.48 --> 3375.359
keep trying there

3372.0 --> 3379.04
but i don't have the patience

3375.359 --> 3379.04
to do that with you here

3387.04 --> 3392.079
don't try to make arguments here well

3390.559 --> 3393.92
you do try

3392.079 --> 3394.7200000000003
but

3393.92 --> 3397.599
like

3394.72 --> 3399.7599999999998
it's not about that

3397.599 --> 3404.119
like this show is not about you

3399.76 --> 3404.119
trying to make arguments here

3407.839 --> 3412.24
don't need any wizardry here

3410.0 --> 3412.24
hey

3416.079 --> 3419.3590000000004
maybe not his wizardry

3418.4 --> 3422.319
i guess

3419.359 --> 3425.4
but there's no real wizardry in it

3422.319 --> 3425.4
you know

3435.28 --> 3440.3590000000004
no psychics traveler i'm not gonna do it

3437.359 --> 3440.359
anyway

3474.0 --> 3479.44
yes akuma virus we know don't worry

3484.96 --> 3489.44
but you gotta realize you are like a

3487.52 --> 3493.839
public figure right

3489.44 --> 3493.839
i mean you are on the flat earth debates

3494.16 --> 3498.72
like we know who you are what you do

3496.96 --> 3503.44
what you've said

3498.72 --> 3506.0789999999997
it seems sometimes like we the guys me

3503.44 --> 3509.76
kevlar seeking star water

3506.079 --> 3509.76
tony whitcomb godzilla

3510.0 --> 3513.2
right

3511.04 --> 3516.5589999999997
and the rest of you guys

3513.2 --> 3519.4399999999996
like we seem to know how you work better

3516.559 --> 3519.44
than you do

3519.68 --> 3523.359
at times

3521.92 --> 3526.64
and

3523.359 --> 3529.839
people still have that in their minds in

3526.64 --> 3534.16
their memories as they're facing you

3529.839 --> 3537.119
right now you don't remember all that

3534.16 --> 3539.359
because that's how you work apparently

3537.119 --> 3540.7200000000003
the doubles think is very thick with

3539.359 --> 3541.52
this one

3540.72 --> 3544.64
but

3541.52 --> 3547.2
we do

3544.64 --> 3550.64
so you can't just roll in and expect

3547.2 --> 3550.64
that you're not gonna be

3550.72 --> 3556.7599999999998
reminded

3552.559 --> 3556.76
of things in the past

3560.48 --> 3564.079
okay that's a little harsh seeking star

3562.4 --> 3567.359
wars

3564.079 --> 3569.3590000000004
can't blame his mom for that

3567.359 --> 3572.7799999999997
i think it's his own fault

3569.359 --> 3574.88
what he's done in his own lifetime

3572.78 --> 3576.799
[Music]

3574.88 --> 3580.119
maybe where he grew up had something to

3576.799 --> 3580.119
do with it

3595.04 --> 3597.839
accidentally

3596.319 --> 3600.4
yeah yeah

3597.839 --> 3604.72
now seeking star wars it's like she lost

3600.4 --> 3606.559
her grip because of coriolis deflection

3604.72 --> 3608.319
she didn't take into account the earth

3606.559 --> 3609.599
spinning and then she accidentally

3608.319 --> 3613.4
dropped him

3609.599 --> 3613.4
that's gotta be the reason

3614.4 --> 3619.359
if we're going to presuppose that

3615.92 --> 3621.76
actually happen i don't think it did

3619.359 --> 3625.48
i mean the earth is not spinning so

3621.76 --> 3625.48
it couldn't have happened

3632.319 --> 3636.96
what have i lied to about this come on

3635.2 --> 3639.359
man

3636.96 --> 3642.48
can't be serious

3639.359 --> 3645.119
maybe maybe the definition of lies is

3642.48 --> 3647.68
something that you actually

3645.119 --> 3648.96
kind of have a different version of

3647.68 --> 3651.9199999999996
right

3648.96 --> 3653.92
but when people double speak say one

3651.92 --> 3656.0
thing then say the exact opposite and

3653.92 --> 3658.0
then say no i didn't say that and then

3656.0 --> 3660.24
proceed to say it again

3658.0 --> 3664.0
and then deny that they did say it after

3660.24 --> 3666.72
that that's what we call lies

3664.0 --> 3669.04
i know you probably don't see that as

3666.72 --> 3670.9599999999996
lies anymore

3669.04 --> 3672.48
more like a like oh it's just an

3670.96 --> 3673.92
accident

3672.48 --> 3678.079
but

3673.92 --> 3679.76
yeah we do actually see that as lies

3678.079 --> 3681.76
derp content

3679.76 --> 3685.8390000000004
that's a little high i don't think it

3681.76 --> 3685.8390000000004
goes past five but

3685.92 --> 3691.119
i mean if it was derp content then it's

3688.079 --> 3695.319
like oh [ __ ]

3691.119 --> 3695.319
everything is melting now

3698.0 --> 3703.76
like derp content would be like a

3701.119 --> 3706.0
a gigantic mud flood like everything

3703.76 --> 3707.44
just vibrating and sinking into the

3706.0 --> 3711.319
earth

3707.44 --> 3711.319
that would be derp content

3716.64 --> 3722.72
no but i don't think like the defcon

3719.839 --> 3724.64
system didn't go past five either if i

3722.72 --> 3728.24
remember correctly

3724.64 --> 3730.0789999999997
i'd like to uphold that

3728.24 --> 3732.5589999999997
that level system

3730.079 --> 3735.559
not not all the way to 10 it's not

3732.559 --> 3735.559
earthquakes

3740.44 --> 3743.63
[Music]

3744.0 --> 3746.88
but whatever

3750.839 --> 3755.0
4.5 yeah

3764.16 --> 3768.24
i'm i think i might have to make like a

3766.559 --> 3770.079
chart

3768.24 --> 3771.52
soon

3770.079 --> 3773.039
like an actual

3771.52 --> 3776.559
i might want to look up like the

3773.039 --> 3778.2400000000002
official defcon graphics

3776.559 --> 3780.96
because there was graphs for that and

3778.24 --> 3783.4399999999996
then alter it

3780.96 --> 3786.16
into the derp con system

3783.44 --> 3788.88
with like like explanations too there's

3786.16 --> 3790.8799999999997
a grading level i'm thinking about this

3788.88 --> 3792.559
i don't know but the idea was kind of

3790.88 --> 3795.44
funny and i'm already like thinking

3792.559 --> 3798.3190000000004
about how am i gonna

3795.44 --> 3800.96
make like an actual

3798.319 --> 3803.0389999999998
well-designed derpcon system i don't

3800.96 --> 3806.88
know why i do it

3803.039 --> 3806.88
but i do it's silly

3807.039 --> 3811.7990000000004
but even silly things can be true

3812.0 --> 3817.039
yes we need a derpcon graph i will i

3814.88 --> 3819.52
will make it

3817.039 --> 3823.559
somewhere

3819.52 --> 3823.559
in the not too distant future

3836.079 --> 3842.4
there's a mental imaging program

3839.28 --> 3845.8390000000004
this sounds like indoctrination

3842.4 --> 3848.88
akumavirus there's a mental imaging

3845.839 --> 3853.599
practice i do that involves focusing on

3848.88 --> 3856.799
the time before i go to sleep

3853.599 --> 3856.799
focusing on the time

3857.28 --> 3859.599
really

3860.16 --> 3865.96
so you just start to count

3862.16 --> 3865.96
the seconds or something

3875.68 --> 3881.319
it's just how i wake up what how you

3878.0 --> 3881.319
wake up

3882.88 --> 3886.1600000000003
what

3884.0 --> 3889.2
what is that

3886.16 --> 3893.799
it's about going to sleep how's that

3889.2 --> 3893.799
involve you how you wake up what

3894.16 --> 3898.64
oh you focus on seeing the time you want

3896.16 --> 3900.319
to wake up oh right

3898.64 --> 3902.72
yeah that makes sense

3900.319 --> 3904.799
i do that too i don't really have to

3902.72 --> 3906.799
like meditate for it or anything it's

3904.799 --> 3912.16
just like yeah i'm supposed to get up at

3906.799 --> 3912.16
that time it just takes like one second

3912.319 --> 3917.119
also i always wake up right before my

3915.28 --> 3919.2000000000003
alarm clock goes off like and

3917.119 --> 3921.28
immediately know like it's going to go

3919.2 --> 3923.839
off right now

3921.28 --> 3923.8390000000004
and then it does

3964.4 --> 3968.319
because you know that yeah i know that

3966.24 --> 3970.4799999999996
akuma virus it's

3968.319 --> 3973.7599999999998
that's not a unique skill

3970.48 --> 3973.76
a lot of people have that

3974.799 --> 3978.96
and it is the focus and yeah you could

3976.72 --> 3980.0
probably do it without the alarm clock

3978.96 --> 3982.7200000000003
but

3980.0 --> 3983.76
the thing is if you don't set your alarm

3982.72 --> 3986.3999999999996
clock

3983.76 --> 3988.48
then you don't automatically

3986.4 --> 3990.559
set the time in your mind that you're

3988.48 --> 3992.88
supposed to wake up a lot of the time

3990.559 --> 3995.3590000000004
right

3992.88 --> 3998.079
now if somebody's like

3995.359 --> 4000.0
forgets to set their alarm clock but

3998.079 --> 4002.079
they were

4000.0 --> 4004.16
thinking that they said it

4002.079 --> 4006.319
then they might just wake up even though

4004.16 --> 4009.68
the alarm clock isn't going off because

4006.319 --> 4012.24
they were anticipating it still

4009.68 --> 4015.0389999999998
right but if you then think oh wait i

4012.24 --> 4017.68
don't need an alarm clock i can just do

4015.039 --> 4020.7200000000003
this and i'll wake up well that could

4017.68 --> 4022.96
like slide and then you don't have the

4020.72 --> 4024.8799999999997
effect anymore right so it is like a

4022.96 --> 4027.76
conditioning process you set the alarm

4024.88 --> 4029.599
clock that automatically sets your mind

4027.76 --> 4031.5200000000004
on that time

4029.599 --> 4034.1600000000003
so arguably it's not even the alarm

4031.52 --> 4036.4
clock that's going to wake you up it is

4034.16 --> 4040.24
using the alarm clock that makes your

4036.4 --> 4044.839
mind focus on getting up at the set time

4040.24 --> 4044.839
not the alarm clock huh

4054.079 --> 4059.28
body clock right

4088.72 --> 4093.2
if they're a nice person that is

4090.799 --> 4096.2

4267.52 --> 4271.080000000001

4342.159 --> 4344.719
incorrect

4348.88 --> 4352.6
never heard of it

4358.88 --> 4365.36
okay well beef jerky is basically just

4362.4 --> 4365.36
dried beef

4365.76 --> 4371.6
it's just beef dried

4369.04 --> 4375.36
and it's like you can use an air

4371.6 --> 4375.360000000001
it's like dried raw beef

4375.76 --> 4379.96
right that's beef jerky

4384.719 --> 4388.88
or smoked right it's smoked sorry

4392.4 --> 4397.759999999999
but it's not like baked or cooked or

4394.239 --> 4401.159
anything but smoked i guess

4397.76 --> 4401.159000000001
smoke dried

4418.08 --> 4421.08
right

4430.8 --> 4436.04
okay gage inspector what would you call

4432.8 --> 4436.04
that then

4447.04 --> 4451.28
it's all this dried beef stuff making me

4449.28 --> 4453.04
want to shoot it yet

4451.28 --> 4455.84
well i don't think that that's gonna be

4453.04 --> 4455.84
too great

4460.48 --> 4464.0
why the hell the

4462.159 --> 4465.5199999999995
weird thing to say

4464.0 --> 4467.92

4465.52 --> 4469.84
don't let your cows dehydrate it doesn't

4467.92 --> 4471.76

4574.4 --> 4578.5199999999995
for the storage and all that

4583.679 --> 4586.679
hmm

4613.04 --> 4617.5199999999995
when you have visitors in my city i go

4616.08 --> 4618.88
up to them and say

4617.52 --> 4620.159000000001
what do you think you're doing in my

4618.88 --> 4623.28
town

4620.159 --> 4625.92
i don't do that i do i barely walk up to

4623.28 --> 4626.719
people and talk to them at all

4625.92 --> 4630.719
but

4626.719 --> 4632.88
if there's a newcomer in the town

4630.719 --> 4635.44
i will know

4632.88 --> 4638.2390000000005
i will be able to sense it

4635.44 --> 4640.159
from their stance that they're not from

4638.239 --> 4642.239
here

4640.159 --> 4644.239
i will be able to tell

4642.239 --> 4648.239
whether they actually respect the

4644.239 --> 4648.239
location and its people or not

4649.12 --> 4654.159
and i've had like

4651.44 --> 4656.0
like let's just say if there's a new bum

4654.159 --> 4657.759999999999
going around because there are a couple

4656.0 --> 4660.96
of those just a couple and they're

4657.76 --> 4662.96
really super harmless and

4660.96 --> 4664.4
barely talk but

4662.96 --> 4666.0
there's like this

4664.4 --> 4669.28
there's a couple of bumps but if there

4666.0 --> 4672.4
is suddenly like a new bomb

4669.28 --> 4674.719
i immediately recognize that like you're

4672.4 --> 4677.28
not from here

4674.719 --> 4680.64
i don't give to bombs that are not from

4677.28 --> 4682.4
my city it's i barely give any it's just

4680.64 --> 4684.2390000000005
very sometimes it's like i got some

4682.4 --> 4686.4
change or something but i always make

4684.239 --> 4687.599999999999
sure to give it to those that i know are

4686.4 --> 4689.679
from here

4687.6 --> 4692.2390000000005
it's like no we don't want bombs from

4689.679 --> 4695.36
other towns thanks

4692.239 --> 4695.36
we got our own bombs

darwin stays home to save lives what the

4701.12 --> 4704.12
hell

4706.96 --> 4709.28
right

4710.96 --> 4715.44
i mean if somebody's like

4713.04 --> 4720.44
acting way out of line

4715.44 --> 4720.44
i usually just end up looking like

4720.8 --> 4724.64
i don't like what you're doing

4726.88 --> 4731.6
i'm not gonna talk like unless they're

4728.719 --> 4734.88
like really like going out of control or

4731.6 --> 4736.08
if if somebody's panicking

4734.88 --> 4738.4800000000005
right

4736.08 --> 4739.84
that's the moment when i might actually

4738.48 --> 4741.12
approach

4739.84 --> 4744.8
you know why

4741.12 --> 4747.679
i've done it before i'm very good

4744.8 --> 4749.679
when everybody's like oh [ __ ] oh we must

4747.679 --> 4752.2390000000005
call the police or something right

4749.679 --> 4754.4
unless somebody's like in a violent

4752.239 --> 4756.159
action which can also be tied in with

4754.4 --> 4757.92
panic but if they're just like panicking

4756.159 --> 4760.719
and it's like you know things are going

4757.92 --> 4760.719
to get out of

4760.84 --> 4768.32
control sometimes i can actually just

4764.32 --> 4768.32
like immediately involve myself

4768.4 --> 4772.799999999999
like they've never seen me before nobody

4770.88 --> 4775.12
ever even sees me talking and then i

4772.8 --> 4777.6
just jump in and like hey hey what's

4775.12 --> 4779.36
going on

4777.6 --> 4781.280000000001
to immediately

4779.36 --> 4783.759999999999
like deflect

4781.28 --> 4786.159
the tension which is leading to the

4783.76 --> 4786.159000000001
panic

4787.28 --> 4791.759999999999
but as long as that's not happening and

4789.6 --> 4794.400000000001
it's just people with an attitude i

4791.76 --> 4796.8
don't really get involved i don't really

4794.4 --> 4798.719
address that

4796.8 --> 4800.400000000001
if somebody's in a panic and nobody's

4798.719 --> 4801.6
doing anything right

4800.4 --> 4803.599999999999
about it

4801.6 --> 4806.0
that's when i can step in even with

4803.6 --> 4810.159000000001
complete strangers

4806.0 --> 4810.159
even if they don't even talk my language

4811.6 --> 4816.360000000001
i've done it before i'm very good at

4813.36 --> 4816.36
that

4816.55 --> 4819.72
[Music]

4821.199 --> 4825.759999999999
especially because nobody else usually

4823.679 --> 4827.76
does anything right

4825.76 --> 4829.4400000000005
they're all just like oh [ __ ] panic we

4827.76 --> 4831.280000000001
don't know what to do it's like hi i

4829.44 --> 4834.32
know what to do

4831.28 --> 4836.239
i know everything what to do

4834.32 --> 4837.36
i know how to get to somebody that's

4836.239 --> 4839.599999999999
like that

4837.36 --> 4842.639
i can help them figure it out i can

4839.6 --> 4845.76
like avoid all the the trappings that

4842.639 --> 4848.08
keep them in that position

4845.76 --> 4851.12
when everybody's all like oh

4848.08 --> 4852.159
i'm like yeah let me at it i can fix

4851.12 --> 4854.0
this

4852.159 --> 4857.638999999999
like in the moment

4854.0 --> 4857.639
no drugs required

4860.0 --> 4864.08
but yeah that rarely happens though

4866.0 --> 4868.88
that's a good thing

4870.8 --> 4874.639
i do still remember like there was this

4872.719 --> 4877.199
time

4874.639 --> 4879.36
five years ago

4877.199 --> 4881.919999999999
i think i even talked about it like on

4879.36 --> 4883.04
the early bird show one of the earlier

4881.92 --> 4884.8
shows

4883.04 --> 4886.159
in the hundreds or something

4884.8 --> 4888.639
where i was just in the middle of the

4886.159 --> 4890.5599999999995
night i felt like this weird impulse

4888.639 --> 4892.2390000000005
like there's something out there i need

4890.56 --> 4893.4400000000005
to go there

4892.239 --> 4894.718999999999
like

4893.44 --> 4896.799999999999
weird

4894.719 --> 4899.36
it was also in the period when i was

4896.8 --> 4901.6
like also hallucinating and [ __ ]

4899.36 --> 4902.799999999999
so it was like a real mystery so i went

4901.6 --> 4904.08
i walked

4902.8 --> 4905.92
and then

4904.08 --> 4909.44
it turned out somebody was like

4905.92 --> 4910.56
screaming full on top of their lungs a

4909.44 --> 4912.159
man

4910.56 --> 4914.4800000000005
on a bridge there

4912.159 --> 4917.28
and he was like hysterically just

4914.48 --> 4918.638999999999
screaming so pissed off but he was

4917.28 --> 4920.4
completely out of control and he was

4918.639 --> 4922.96
drunk

4920.4 --> 4924.96
and there was literally police gathering

4922.96 --> 4926.8
like on the other side of the bridge

4924.96 --> 4928.8
like a couple of guys and they were

4926.8 --> 4931.28
gonna go after them i knew they were so

4928.8 --> 4933.360000000001
what i did is i just walked up to him

4931.28 --> 4936.48
like hi

4933.36 --> 4938.0
are you okay you seem really pissed off

4936.48 --> 4940.0
you realize that

4938.0 --> 4941.52
if you don't stop

4940.0 --> 4944.159
and like

4941.52 --> 4945.76
you you let it off your chest right now

4944.159 --> 4947.36
but you gotta stop because otherwise

4945.76 --> 4950.639
you're gonna be arrested and then you're

4947.36 --> 4952.239
gonna feel even worse about yourself

4950.639 --> 4954.0
and he was like

4952.239 --> 4956.718999999999
oh oh

4954.0 --> 4959.44
right and then he just stopped and he

4956.719 --> 4963.44
went home

4959.44 --> 4963.44
you know and he was like like

4964.159 --> 4970.719
i'm gonna kill you laura did really

4967.84 --> 4973.04
he was like in a bad place and that's

4970.719 --> 4976.32
when everybody shits their pants and

4973.04 --> 4979.5199999999995
runs away and calls the cops

4976.32 --> 4982.08
scary man i'm like yeah i will just walk

4979.52 --> 4984.4800000000005
straight up to him

4982.08 --> 4988.239
now it helps having a black

4984.48 --> 4988.239
having a black coat right

4988.4 --> 4991.36
it does help

4989.92 --> 4992.96
it does

4991.36 --> 4995.5199999999995
it helps

4992.96 --> 4997.04
if you want to do that specifically

4995.52 --> 4998.88
and i just

4997.04 --> 5000.639
made him snap out of it

4998.88 --> 5002.4800000000005
without making him feel bad about

5000.639 --> 5004.400000000001
himself because he probably was already

5002.48 --> 5006.5599999999995
having enough of that

5004.4 --> 5008.4
and he was in a panic over it felt like

5006.56 --> 5010.2390000000005
his life was probably completely falling

5008.4 --> 5012.239
apart and it might have been

5010.239 --> 5015.199
so it just helped to remind him like

5012.239 --> 5018.879999999999
yeah

5015.199 --> 5020.48
right it's not the end of the world

5018.88 --> 5021.92
just

5020.48 --> 5024.638999999999
you let it out

5021.92 --> 5027.1990000000005
now you got to get it back under control

5024.639 --> 5028.96
go home and fix it

5027.199 --> 5031.12
i didn't even know what it was bothering

5028.96 --> 5035.44
him really it probably had something to

5031.12 --> 5035.44
do with like spousal fight or something

5036.239 --> 5039.839999999999
right

5037.6 --> 5042.719
but when everybody else panics

5039.84 --> 5046.0
like oh no this is scary it might be

5042.719 --> 5048.639
violent that's like oh okay that's when

5046.0 --> 5051.44
i walk in just like that

5048.639 --> 5051.4400000000005
like yeah hi

5051.679 --> 5056.639
what's wrong because i'm not afraid i'm

5054.48 --> 5060.08
not afraid of people that are panicking

5056.639 --> 5063.52
i'm not afraid of people that are like

5060.08 --> 5065.76
like have violent outbursts

5063.52 --> 5068.88
because they're like super frustrated

5065.76 --> 5071.04
about something i know how it works

5068.88 --> 5074.4800000000005
i deal with that

5071.04 --> 5074.48
i'm not scared of it

5074.8 --> 5080.88
right doesn't mean oh oh i can do that

5078.239 --> 5082.638999999999
oh so that means i'm now going to be a

5080.88 --> 5085.28
professional

5082.639 --> 5089.84
psychologist that's gonna hang around

5085.28 --> 5092.0
people that have those issues all day

5089.84 --> 5093.6
no thank you

5092.0 --> 5096.639
no

5093.6 --> 5096.639
not gonna do that

5097.12 --> 5100.88
but i will

5098.96 --> 5103.92
use the opportunity if it presents

5100.88 --> 5103.92
itself in the moment

5105.36 --> 5109.12
i don't need to be paid for that

5110.639 --> 5115.04
but i'm not gonna be stuck to some kind

5112.639 --> 5117.84
of a paid profession where i constantly

5115.04 --> 5120.08
i'm dealing with hysterical people i'm

5117.84 --> 5122.96
not gonna do that either i mean

5120.08 --> 5126.159
dealing with like anti-flat earthers is

5122.96 --> 5129.36
already bad enough

5126.159 --> 5129.36
but it could get worse

5130.4 --> 5135.28
when you get into like actual

5133.199 --> 5137.36
mental health care there's some really

5135.28 --> 5139.28
[ __ ] up situations out there of people

5137.36 --> 5142.159
that have just been out of control so

5139.28 --> 5145.599999999999
long and nobody helps them because

5142.159 --> 5145.599999999999
nobody knows how

5147.84 --> 5151.639
because everybody's just

5149.84 --> 5154.4800000000005
weak

5151.639 --> 5157.04
uninsightful they don't understand human

5154.48 --> 5159.759999999999
minds they don't understand

5157.04 --> 5161.679
complications they over generalize and

5159.76 --> 5164.4800000000005
they don't really get it

5161.679 --> 5169.0
they have mechanisms to analyze but they

5164.48 --> 5169.0
don't understand it

5169.679 --> 5174.159
anyway there's enough ranting about that

5175.28 --> 5180.08
nobody really here seems to care anyway

5177.76 --> 5183.84
right

5180.08 --> 5183.84
talking among one another

5208.48 --> 5212.879999999999
hello pgsc net

5210.96 --> 5215.36
yeah

5212.88 --> 5218.6
i am gonna round out it not too long

5215.36 --> 5218.599999999999
though but

5233.44 --> 5236.44
hmm

5246.159 --> 5249.719
that's right pgcnet

5254.719 --> 5259.92
right well the whole problem

5256.96 --> 5262.4
the universal problem i'd say is like an

5259.92 --> 5264.84
extension of the medical system problems

5262.4 --> 5267.44
with the mental health care

5264.84 --> 5269.679
system is

5267.44 --> 5272.4
they treat the

5269.679 --> 5274.4
aberration they're like oh you have this

5272.4 --> 5277.12
and then they just focus on that they

5274.4 --> 5279.839999999999
don't focus on what is actually causing

5277.12 --> 5283.12
it as a symptom right because mental

5279.84 --> 5285.12
health issues always are symptoms

5283.12 --> 5287.12
they're sick they're not the cause

5285.12 --> 5288.48
they're the effect

5287.12 --> 5291.28
always

5288.48 --> 5293.759999999999
always

5291.28 --> 5294.4
if you figure out somebody

5293.76 --> 5295.84
through

5294.4 --> 5297.44
holistic

5295.84 --> 5299.52
approach

5297.44 --> 5301.759999999999
you really go with the spirit of an

5299.52 --> 5303.360000000001
individual where they come from how they

5301.76 --> 5304.88
live what kind of people are they

5303.36 --> 5310.159
surrounded with

5304.88 --> 5312.96
who are their examples in life then

5310.159 --> 5316.159
can just help them manage themselves

5312.96 --> 5317.76
help them figure out like oh

5316.159 --> 5319.759999999999
if you do that

5317.76 --> 5321.76
this is going to come out of it

5319.76 --> 5324.0
you're going to get those symptoms then

5321.76 --> 5326.159000000001
in those situations you need to learn

5324.0 --> 5327.679
how to deal with that and

5326.159 --> 5329.599999999999
just yeah

5327.679 --> 5330.639
of course

5329.6 --> 5333.280000000001
some

5330.639 --> 5335.52
psychologists do actually effectively

5333.28 --> 5339.12
help those types of people and then they

5335.52 --> 5342.88
do overcome it but a lot of the times

5339.12 --> 5344.88
it yeah when you don't connect

5342.88 --> 5346.4800000000005
like when you're psychologically in a

5344.88 --> 5348.639
crisis

5346.48 --> 5352.0
you're like in a bad place and you seek

5348.639 --> 5353.92
help right and you don't connect

5352.0 --> 5355.84
the doctor

5353.92 --> 5357.76
healthcare worker

5355.84 --> 5360.56
social worker

5357.76 --> 5363.4400000000005
psychologist you don't connect

5360.56 --> 5365.6
while you're in a crisis it's

5363.44 --> 5367.678999999999
you like you're not in control it's very

5365.6 --> 5368.639
difficult when you're super stressed out

5367.679 --> 5371.36
and like

5368.639 --> 5373.12
broken from it

5371.36 --> 5374.0
to then say

5373.12 --> 5377.199
you're

5374.0 --> 5380.0
a bad worker you're not helping i have

5377.199 --> 5383.12
to find another when you're broken

5380.0 --> 5386.639
you're much more likely to think no it's

5383.12 --> 5388.719
me i'm the one that's wrong and that's

5386.639 --> 5393.12
what is then abused

5388.719 --> 5394.96
for just bad programming

5393.12 --> 5397.199
right and that's a problem that's a

5394.96 --> 5400.2390000000005
universal problem

5397.199 --> 5403.36
people that seek mental help

5400.239 --> 5404.799999999999
are often not strong enough

5403.36 --> 5407.599999999999
to basically

5404.8 --> 5410.4800000000005
tell apart a good from a bad health care

5407.6 --> 5413.84
worker for their mental health

5410.48 --> 5417.5199999999995
because they're broken

5413.84 --> 5418.32
and nobody's there to like hey hey

5417.52 --> 5421.040000000001
uh

5418.32 --> 5422.719
you're not doing this right

5421.04 --> 5424.96
and yeah you

5422.719 --> 5427.6
like you need another

5424.96 --> 5429.28
worker this is not working out

5427.6 --> 5431.76
right

5429.28 --> 5434.08
third party checks

5431.76 --> 5437.52
have you ever heard of that third party

5434.08 --> 5440.4
checks for mental health care workers

5437.52 --> 5440.400000000001
no i haven't

5440.48 --> 5445.759999999999
right they only come ringing an alarm

5443.199 --> 5448.4
when things go super wrong and like

5445.76 --> 5450.4800000000005
somebody commits suicide or something or

5448.4 --> 5451.44
violence happens

5450.48 --> 5452.159
right

5451.44 --> 5453.36
no

5452.159 --> 5455.5199999999995
they don't

5453.36 --> 5458.48
actually check hey

5455.52 --> 5460.8
is this healthcare worker actually

5458.48 --> 5465.44
working for this guy

5460.8 --> 5465.4400000000005
or girl woman man whatever

5467.36 --> 5469.759999999999
right

5468.32 --> 5472.96
they just

5469.76 --> 5475.12
you have to figure that out as the

5472.96 --> 5478.0
participant as the one seeking it like

5475.12 --> 5479.92
you just if you don't figure it out

5478.0 --> 5481.84
you'll just be stuck with somebody

5479.92 --> 5485.04
that's telling you all kinds of [ __ ]

5481.84 --> 5485.04
that's not good for you

5488.56 --> 5493.360000000001
if you don't actually figure out that

5490.48 --> 5493.36
it's not working

5495.76 --> 5500.88
so there's like this

5497.76 --> 5502.88
dilemma and it it's it's not really

5500.88 --> 5506.2390000000005
fixable the way things are set up right

5502.88 --> 5508.4800000000005
now right there's no holistic approach

5506.239 --> 5510.879999999999
and it's always going to lead to these

5508.48 --> 5513.599999999999
situations where somebody in a weakened

5510.88 --> 5515.84
state is going to seek help and then the

5513.6 --> 5517.679
help they're going to get is not good

5515.84 --> 5520.08
but they can't

5517.679 --> 5522.2390000000005
do anything about it they're just too

5520.08 --> 5525.36
broken they stuck to them and then

5522.239 --> 5527.28
they're just subjected to their bad

5525.36 --> 5530.639
programming

5527.28 --> 5533.84
this happens out there it's a problem

5530.639 --> 5533.84
it's always been a problem

5542.159 --> 5545.879999999999
right anyway

5559.44 --> 5565.12
hmm

5561.84 --> 5566.8
all right lucky you devil's that forget

5565.12 --> 5569.199
yeah if you're already used to working

5566.8 --> 5571.6
at home then covet stuff won't have

5569.199 --> 5573.12
affected you like with me it's barely

5571.6 --> 5576.08
affected me

5573.12 --> 5576.08
i mean i had to

5576.56 --> 5581.679
mostly just enjoy how everybody's all

5579.199 --> 5585.599999999999
doing that and getting faxed up and

5581.679 --> 5587.52
just a giant disaster unrolling

5585.6 --> 5588.96
but personally i haven't really been

5587.52 --> 5591.96
affected

5588.96 --> 5591.96
either

5628.88 --> 5631.84
