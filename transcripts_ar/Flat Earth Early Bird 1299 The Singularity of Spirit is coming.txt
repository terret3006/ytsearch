kind of windy and very moist

122.0 --> 126.159
hasn't actually rained

124.24 --> 128.47899999999998
so far but it's there's just a lot of

126.159 --> 132.16
moist in the air and

128.479 --> 132.16000000000003
it has cooled down actually

135.28 --> 137.68
right

137.76 --> 146.64
so not exactly a sunny sunday but

143.12 --> 146.64000000000001
still does feel like summer

150.48 --> 157.509
alright

152.71 --> 157.50900000000001
[Music]

158.48 --> 161.599
to oh it's 21 degrees

160.64 --> 163.83999999999997
still

161.599 --> 163.84
okay

165.76 --> 169.64
it was cold it is more

174.8 --> 181.28
right anyhow nobody's in chat just yet

178.4 --> 185.08
oh wait a kumu virus

181.28 --> 185.08
first in chat hello

185.68 --> 191.959
is

186.959 --> 191.959
sunday the 10th of july 2022

198.8 --> 202.31900000000002
yeah i'm doing

200.879 --> 204.319
okay

202.319 --> 206.319
not could have been better

204.319 --> 208.879
i mean i'm very restless because of

206.319 --> 211.28
financial situation which is not in the

208.879 --> 211.95999999999998
at a good point for me

211.28 --> 214.64000000000001
general

211.96 --> 216.72
[Music]

214.64 --> 219.27999999999997
there's a lot of tension rising up in

216.72 --> 219.28
the world

222.08 --> 225.92000000000002
i mean

223.36 --> 229.59900000000002
like sri lanka just overthrew their

225.92 --> 229.599
government now as well and

229.84 --> 234.4
yes uh wait

232.799 --> 236.48000000000002
in poland

234.4 --> 240.4
i've heard

236.48 --> 243.51899999999998
potentially italy so this is like yeah

240.4 --> 243.519
there's something happening

244.4 --> 248.87900000000002
and it's exciting but

246.56 --> 251.36
a bit unnerving

248.879 --> 254.79899999999998
because this probably gonna lead to a

251.36 --> 256.639
hard clash of some kind

254.799 --> 259.04
but it might not

256.639 --> 262.0
i don't know for sure

259.04 --> 262.0
right says that

262.32 --> 267.28
that's weird running on 24 7 flattered

265.44 --> 270.8
discard today

267.28 --> 273.52
got me kicked off actually

270.8 --> 276.88
i was just like talking in their chat

273.52 --> 278.639
laying down solid flat earth information

276.88 --> 280.24
and about the scientific method and all

278.639 --> 284.32
that

280.24 --> 284.32
and then some guy in there

285.04 --> 287.28000000000003
just

287.68 --> 291.759
started to go up against me i wasn't

290.0 --> 293.919
even sure like what the hell his point

291.759 --> 296.0
was it's about

293.919 --> 298.479
how

296.0 --> 300.72
the flat earth is not a disk that that's

298.479 --> 302.479
just a map projection and i explained

300.72 --> 304.16
him like three times and he just didn't

302.479 --> 306.08
get it and then i got pissed off and

304.16 --> 307.28000000000003
said like yeah okay go [ __ ] yourself

306.08 --> 309.35999999999996
then

307.28 --> 312.0
and he muted me

309.36 --> 313.84000000000003
so i went on to the voice chat

312.0 --> 315.759
started to lay down exactly what i

313.84 --> 316.71999999999997
thought of that

315.759 --> 319.28000000000003
and then

316.72 --> 322.16
yeah they defended him

319.28 --> 324.32
it's just pure picking order dumbass

322.16 --> 326.72
behavior like they didn't just say like

324.32 --> 328.88
hey yeah

326.72 --> 330.639
you might have a point

328.88 --> 333.28
and yeah when you do that to me i have

330.639 --> 334.479
absolutely no respect for that so i just

333.28 --> 338.479
started

334.479 --> 340.32
basically [ __ ] talking at this guy

338.479 --> 342.08
like

340.32 --> 345.759
and then i got kicked off and i don't

342.08 --> 345.75899999999996
really feel like coming back anyway

346.08 --> 350.15999999999997
uh

347.6 --> 353.03900000000004
because it was just

350.16 --> 355.36
just stupid

353.039 --> 358.08
idiots

355.36 --> 358.08000000000004
blabbering

358.96 --> 361.35999999999996
hello

361.44 --> 367.56
sledder sage good to see you

364.319 --> 367.56
like sudanic

376.96 --> 380.44
right yeah derek

380.639 --> 386.72
yeah owen

382.24 --> 386.72
posted like this pretty epic clip

391.36 --> 395.72
so check it out it's not long

412.479 --> 415.479
um

415.67 --> 418.889
[Music]

459.919 --> 464.4
hey steamy traveler

462.96 --> 467.75899999999996
you think the netherlands will be the

464.4 --> 467.75899999999996
next government overthrown

468.96 --> 472.4
maybe

470.4 --> 475.52
maybe

472.4 --> 477.67999999999995
i mean there's like this

475.52 --> 479.52
ultimatum that the farmers here the

477.68 --> 481.84000000000003
organized farmers have

479.52 --> 481.84
given

482.24 --> 485.759
and they've already announced like yet

484.879 --> 488.8
like

485.759 --> 491.28000000000003
if you think that we've been like

488.8 --> 493.52000000000004
protesting and disruptive so far you

491.28 --> 496.0
ain't seen nothing yet so they've got

493.52 --> 498.4
big plans

496.0 --> 498.4
and

498.479 --> 504.0
it's very likely that the military are

500.96 --> 504.0
gonna get involved

504.319 --> 509.759
dutch is like not the government

508.319 --> 513.5600000000001
these

509.759 --> 513.5600000000001
treacherous infiltrators

514.479 --> 520.08
they've already like

517.44 --> 522.719
shown that they don't really care so

520.08 --> 524.32
there they would have eventually

522.719 --> 526.24
deployed them anyway but i think it's

524.32 --> 527.2
gonna there's gonna be a clash of some

526.24 --> 530.64
kind

527.2 --> 530.6400000000001
it's gonna be very tense

531.44 --> 536.5600000000001
and that might lead to the overthrow of

533.839 --> 539.839
the government it might happen

536.56 --> 543.1199999999999
or it might not happen i don't know

539.839 --> 543.12
but the clash is coming

544.32 --> 549.6800000000001
will i stand and fight with the farmers

547.44 --> 551.7600000000001
well that the pet do they need me i

549.68 --> 552.959
don't even depends on what they're gonna

551.76 --> 555.4399999999999
do like

552.959 --> 556.64
if it comes down to like we literally

555.44 --> 560.08
need like

556.64 --> 563.04
public shock troops

560.08 --> 565.6
to like overrun

563.04 --> 569.04
government buildings like in sri lanka

565.6 --> 571.76
then yeah then i guess that i would

569.04 --> 573.76
potentially help out or i'd be very

571.76 --> 575.68
typically like a media a guy sitting

573.76 --> 578.48
here in my room like always and trying

575.68 --> 581.3599999999999
to report about it

578.48 --> 581.36
at a distance

581.76 --> 585.8389999999999
it's not like a lot i got a lot of

583.76 --> 588.959
financial maneuvering room right now i'm

585.839 --> 590.9590000000001
really trying to scramble for food

588.959 --> 593.1999999999999
so

590.959 --> 593.1999999999999
like

604.399 --> 606.64
whoa

611.2 --> 614.1600000000001
10 months damn

613.2 --> 617.48
there it

614.16 --> 617.48
that's incredible

639.279 --> 642.959
right hey but

641.519 --> 645.6
dude

642.959 --> 646.8
this farmer organization wants something

645.6 --> 650.5600000000001
from me

646.8 --> 653.3599999999999
i'll listen i i just don't i think they

650.56 --> 655.76
try to avoid me because

653.36 --> 658.24
i'm not very convenient

655.76 --> 661.12
i'm way too loud and too aggressive i

658.24 --> 664.0
think they're all just very

661.12 --> 664.0
careful and

665.36 --> 667.76
different

668.88 --> 672.959
but i hope they do realize that i am

670.8 --> 674.8
absolutely on their side

672.959 --> 678.079
it's just that i i don't know if i could

674.8 --> 678.079
literally contribute

678.24 --> 681.76
other than through spirit

682.079 --> 685.8199999999999
and through my well what i do my

683.839 --> 689.019
analysis and all that

685.82 --> 689.019
[Music]

693.2 --> 698.6
what thomas larson no never even heard

695.519 --> 698.6
of that

705.15 --> 708.35
[Music]

712.079 --> 715.079
hmm

727.04 --> 731.399
okay tara that's interesting

739.04 --> 742.92
what george said

744.32 --> 747.44
what are you talking about

749.6 --> 753.0400000000001
this i mean

751.76 --> 756.3199999999999
yeah

753.04 --> 758.0
over that course of the 24 hours

756.32 --> 761.88
what's the point of saying that george

758.0 --> 761.88
sanford i don't get it

773.519 --> 776.519
um

796.56 --> 802.7199999999999
this is your eight-year-old camera

800.48 --> 804.48
hmm

802.72 --> 807.519
yeah you did get into that freak

804.48 --> 807.519
accident didn't you

819.279 --> 822.8
i hope it's healing up all right

825.839 --> 832.24
but yeah there was this weird resonance

829.839 --> 834.0
on the 8th of july

832.24 --> 836.32
or a lot of like

834.0 --> 838.88
where something snapped like on the

836.32 --> 841.1990000000001
spiritual level like with all like

838.88 --> 844.24
everybody had

841.199 --> 846.399
something that happened

844.24 --> 849.6
pretty dramatic in some way a lot of

846.399 --> 849.6
dramatic things happen

850.72 --> 855.6800000000001
oh hello slow mo buggy

854.16 --> 859.639
okay

855.68 --> 859.6389999999999
thanks for the video link

878.32 --> 887.0400000000001
okay so what 99

881.6 --> 888.72
in a singular moment at 7 00

887.04 --> 890.24
am et

888.72 --> 892.9590000000001
what

890.24 --> 895.12
so there was like this weird exaggerated

892.959 --> 896.6389999999999
amount of daylight happening you're

895.12 --> 899.839
saying

896.639 --> 899.839
that's weird

921.44 --> 925.6800000000001
that is so odd

923.76 --> 927.12
in so many ways

925.68 --> 930.4399999999999
like i didn't even know what that was

927.12 --> 930.44
going on

949.759 --> 952.759
hmm

960.399 --> 963.759
oh really thomas larson

964.88 --> 971.92
which countries are those

968.16 --> 971.92
pitch dark after five minutes

973.279 --> 976.24
is that all

975.279 --> 980.4399999999999
like

976.24 --> 980.44
places south of the equator

1002.24 --> 1006.9590000000001
right anyhow interesting

1005.519 --> 1010.279
i guess

1006.959 --> 1010.279
little odds

1030.88 --> 1033.88
hmm

1048.079 --> 1054.24
why does it get

1049.919 --> 1054.24
pitch dark quickly south of the equator

1060.799 --> 1065.84
because that's the way the the

1062.799 --> 1069.44
celestials are arranged

1065.84 --> 1069.4399999999998
guess because the arc

1070.48 --> 1073.76
yeah

1071.44 --> 1077.48
how do you explain that is really weird

1073.76 --> 1077.48
when you think of it

1086.32 --> 1091.28
i don't i can't even properly explain as

1089.039 --> 1093.52
to why there's still daylight after the

1091.28 --> 1095.76
sun went down

1093.52 --> 1098.08
like technically

1095.76 --> 1101.12
it's so like in my holographic model

1098.08 --> 1101.12
especially it's like

1101.2 --> 1107.4
yeah

1102.48 --> 1107.4
i can't really explain why

1111.039 --> 1117.36
and maybe it's because the angular speed

1114.24 --> 1118.88
of the trajectory on average of the sun

1117.36 --> 1122.24
is bigger

1118.88 --> 1125.0390000000002
south of the equator

1122.24 --> 1127.52
and so as it approaches the apparent

1125.039 --> 1129.679
horizon it will also

1127.52 --> 1132.08
pass

1129.679 --> 1132.0800000000002
quicker

1133.6 --> 1137.28
and then

1134.799 --> 1140.4
it becomes darker quicker

1137.28 --> 1140.3999999999999
this is so like

1142.08 --> 1147.559
trying to feel it out because i don't

1144.16 --> 1147.559
really know

1165.36 --> 1171.24
weird mass media told everyone yeah that

1167.76 --> 1171.24
is kind of weird

1188.96 --> 1192.38
[Music]

1193.84 --> 1197.6999999999998
all right but i hope my explanation at

1195.76 --> 1208.57
least makes somewhat

1197.7 --> 1208.57
[Music]

1216.48 --> 1222.4
right but i wanted to know i did explain

1218.88 --> 1224.3200000000002
right so the angular speed of the sun

1222.4 --> 1227.679
south of the equator the of the

1224.32 --> 1230.32
trajectory of the full circle

1227.679 --> 1232.96
angular speed should be greater

1230.32 --> 1234.96
like it's a bigger path south of the

1232.96 --> 1237.28
equator

1234.96 --> 1237.28
and

1237.6 --> 1243.1999999999998
because of that as it this apparent

1240.64 --> 1246.159
trajectory is hitting the apparent

1243.2 --> 1248.559
horizon folding

1246.159 --> 1251.3600000000001
well if the angular speed if there's

1248.559 --> 1253.52
just more movement effectively out

1251.36 --> 1255.6
throughout the sky then once it hits the

1253.52 --> 1258.72
horizon it only makes sense that the

1255.6 --> 1259.76
daylight also disappears quicker

1258.72 --> 1263.1200000000001
i i

1259.76 --> 1265.84
can't put it down

1263.12 --> 1267.039
better than that at this point

1265.84 --> 1269.28

immediately delving into physicality

1269.28 --> 1273.84
assumption bias-based modeling

1272.559 --> 1276.559
right

1273.84 --> 1278.6399999999999
as you could say based on the assumption

1276.559 --> 1280.3999999999999
that it's physical in euclidean space

1278.64 --> 1282.48
like oh

1280.4 --> 1285.6000000000001
yes

1282.48 --> 1287.76
it's moving faster away from you

1285.6 --> 1289.84
relation to your position on the disk

1287.76 --> 1291.28
and then yeah you could

1289.84 --> 1293.76
give that as a

1291.28 --> 1295.44
disc earth or alternative explanation

1293.76 --> 1297.12
and then

1295.44 --> 1298.88
say like yeah

1297.12 --> 1303.039
that's you could

1298.88 --> 1303.0390000000002
indeed see it like that if you choose to

1303.679 --> 1310.0800000000002
but i'm trying not to do that

1308.0 --> 1312.159
and just stick to the information that

1310.08 --> 1317.08
is available

1312.159 --> 1317.0800000000002
instead of speculation about it

1685.52 --> 1692.8799999999999
impossible day on the globe video

1689.44 --> 1692.88
that is very candy

1697.36 --> 1702.1589999999999
within that presupposed sun position

1733.6 --> 1738.559
oh my god really slow-mo movie oh my god

1736.399 --> 1740.559
they do that

1738.559 --> 1743.76
do people ever get pulled over by the

1867.84 --> 1871.84
it's a 2000 i don't remember

1875.84 --> 1879.559

what

1919.72 --> 1925.76
astronomical twilight

1923.36 --> 1929.32
now the thing that the map shows it

1925.76 --> 1929.32
pretty well jarvis

1934.48 --> 1939.24
here i'll timestamp it

1949.519 --> 1953.519
so yeah it's going to be twilight for

1951.279 --> 1957.399
some but it's still

1953.519 --> 1957.3990000000001
light is still light

1988.84 --> 1996.48
oh but so it's all not that

1992.399 --> 1998.4799999999998
amazing right it's i mean it's just

1996.48 --> 2001.039
jarvis you seem to be like really want

1998.48 --> 2004.159
to downplay this is there any motivation

2001.039 --> 2005.279
behind this

2004.159 --> 2007.44
because

2005.279 --> 2008.799
it definitely can't happen on a ball

2007.44 --> 2011.279
earth

2008.799 --> 2011.279
you know

2013.44 --> 2016.8400000000001
just saying

2038.559 --> 2042.559
it's expected on the globe of course it

2040.799 --> 2045.279
is a good worse

2042.559 --> 2045.279
of course

2045.36 --> 2048.72
show me the simulation of how that

2047.6 --> 2051.04
happens

2048.72 --> 2052.72
on the globe

2051.04 --> 2055.679
i mean it's got to be out there

2052.72 --> 2058.0
somewhere there has to be some desperate

2055.679 --> 2059.679
ball religion your reinforcer that's

2058.0 --> 2062.159
going to make an animation of how that's

2059.679 --> 2064.56
supposed to work on a globe

2062.159 --> 2067.839
you got one

2064.56 --> 2067.839
this isn't news

2068.0 --> 2075.76
yeah we know the earth being flat isn't

2070.96 --> 2077.919
news it's old news we know

2075.76 --> 2080.7200000000003
and ballers

2077.919 --> 2083.839
of course expecting everything that is

2080.72 --> 2085.6789999999996
seen in reality to happen on the globe

2083.839 --> 2087.7599999999998
is also to be

2085.679 --> 2089.679
expected that's not news either because

2087.76 --> 2091.679
they've been doing that forever it's

2089.679 --> 2093.839
always afterwards

2091.679 --> 2097.2000000000003
a bunch of weird machinations and

2093.839 --> 2098.88
justifications and just trying to rob

2097.2 --> 2101.04
insights under the carpet before

2098.88 --> 2102.8
somebody like really catches on to what

2101.04 --> 2105.44
they did

2102.8 --> 2109.119
yeah that's not news either

2105.44 --> 2111.44
that happens all the time we know

2109.119 --> 2113.6800000000003
it follows the model except you don't

2111.44 --> 2113.68
though

2114.0 --> 2119.52
you in general akuma virus don't

2117.119 --> 2123.44
actually follow the model

2119.52 --> 2123.44
you're supposed to but you don't

2128.32 --> 2134.7200000000003
because apparently it not matching with

2130.64 --> 2134.72
reality is unacceptable to you

2137.2 --> 2141.9199999999996
because that's what you got to do

2139.44 --> 2144.88
if you really believe in the globe

2141.92 --> 2150.28
you got to accept that reality

2144.88 --> 2150.28
is not doing what the globe model says

2169.81 --> 2173.139

2173.2 --> 2179.2
would us guys have to know about it

2176.8 --> 2182.2000000000003
if they didn't what

2179.2 --> 2182.2
why

2194.079 --> 2199.6800000000003
size of the sunroof reaction blah blah

2197.04 --> 2202.56
yes yes of course

2199.68 --> 2206.64
yeah except refraction terrestrial

2202.56 --> 2208.56
refraction is not part of the model

2206.64 --> 2211.7599999999998
in the model

2208.56 --> 2214.64
boats are still going over the horizon

2211.76 --> 2218.48
because the horizon is geometric

2214.64 --> 2218.48
there's refraction that doesn't work

2221.28 --> 2225.76
you're just gonna have to let that black

2223.599 --> 2227.119
swan rape you

2225.76 --> 2228.6400000000003
and then

2227.119 --> 2231.6800000000003
move on

2228.64 --> 2234.64
you can't invoke refraction because then

2231.68 --> 2237.8799999999997
you've sidestepped your model you can't

2234.64 --> 2237.8799999999997
do that

2242.56 --> 2246.72
hey nobody says that being a globe

2244.64 --> 2248.96
believer was easy

2246.72 --> 2250.64
especially once you no longer have the

2248.96 --> 2253.68
bliss of ignorance

2250.64 --> 2255.7599999999998
yeah it's brutal you basically get raped

2253.68 --> 2257.839
and raped and raped again

2255.76 --> 2260.1600000000003
because everything about it is wrong and

2257.839 --> 2262.64
that's what the price is if you want to

2260.16 --> 2264.64
truly believe

2262.64 --> 2267.64
after the veil of ignorance has been

2264.64 --> 2267.64
lifted

2271.92 --> 2274.96
yes

2272.8 --> 2278.079
of course you had a nice dinner with the

2274.96 --> 2278.079
black swan i mean

2281.92 --> 2286.16
but you are still bottom

2285.04 --> 2289.839
right

2286.16 --> 2291.68
so you can think that it was a nice date

2289.839 --> 2294.64
with the black swan of course you can

2291.68 --> 2298.9199999999996
think so but reality

2294.64 --> 2298.92
unfortunately proves otherwise

2323.04 --> 2325.52

2324.72 --> 2328.0789999999997
ah

2325.52 --> 2332.44
it's got a little gross even for me but

2328.079 --> 2332.44
just trying to make a point here

2351.599 --> 2355.839
he didn't mention any territory

2356.24 --> 2359.24
uh

2388.91 --> 2393.85
[Music]

2397.04 --> 2401.04
yeah it's too bad isn't it jarvis and

2399.119 --> 2403.04
you know what even what's even funnier

2401.04 --> 2406.4
about it

2403.04 --> 2408.88
yeah it it it is very much impossible to

2406.4 --> 2412.2400000000002
actually recreate a model a miniature

2408.88 --> 2414.079
like that in a in lab

2412.24 --> 2417.2
in the real world right

2414.079 --> 2420.88
but you know what's even funnier

2417.2 --> 2422.16
they can't even properly emulate it

2420.88 --> 2424.1600000000003
right

2422.16 --> 2426.7999999999997
and that's the most hilarious thing

2424.16 --> 2430.7599999999998
about it is that even within all the

2426.8 --> 2430.76
precip presuppositional

2431.68 --> 2437.04
ideas of how it supposed to work and how

2434.8 --> 2440.319
the gas is supposed to have weighed and

2437.04 --> 2444.0
sip and all of that combined

2440.319 --> 2446.72
you can't actually even emulate that

2444.0 --> 2449.599
in the digital that's why there isn't

2446.72 --> 2454.0
any proper emulations

2449.599 --> 2456.4
because it just really doesn't work

2454.0 --> 2459.2
it really doesn't work like the

2456.4 --> 2460.4
elementary mathematical

2459.2 --> 2463.1189999999997
parts

2460.4 --> 2466.079
of what's the dynamics and the fluidity

2463.119 --> 2467.92
of what's happening like it just doesn't

2466.079 --> 2470.079
work

2467.92 --> 2472.56
when you put it together the math the

2470.079 --> 2474.88
presupposed math and the ideas of the

2472.56 --> 2476.4
globe and how that's supposed to it just

2474.88 --> 2479.359
doesn't work

2476.4 --> 2480.4
they just can't get it to work

2479.359 --> 2484.72
because

2480.4 --> 2487.599
it's not real you can't even simulate it

2484.72 --> 2491.319
right it's that bad you can't even

2487.599 --> 2491.319
simulate it

flat earth

but just as well may not have a dome

2517.44 --> 2522.88
what it certainly has is containment i

2519.839 --> 2526.4
personally think it's a blacktop

2522.88 --> 2528.1600000000003
and the sun and the moon are not objects

2526.4 --> 2532.96
in the realm

2528.16 --> 2532.96
of flat earth they're all lights

2534.0 --> 2537.04
that's right flat earth has no

atmosphere

2537.04 --> 2541.44
atmos air

2538.96 --> 2544.8
and sphere are self-contradicting

2541.44 --> 2547.359
besides the flat earth doesn't need an

2544.8 --> 2549.44
atmosphere imagination because it's not

2547.359 --> 2552.88
a ball

2549.44 --> 2555.119
it has is just air air pressure

be you are [ __ ] projecting [ __ ]

2642.4 --> 2648.319
this is rudimentary

2644.64 --> 2652.24
gas does not take the form of a sphere

2648.319 --> 2654.8
atmosphere is a contradiction in terms

2652.24 --> 2655.5989999999997
you're [ __ ] if you don't realize

2654.8 --> 2659.119
that

2655.599 --> 2661.04
yeah an atmosphere has been colloquially

2659.119 --> 2663.28
popularized as

2661.04 --> 2665.7599999999998
meaning the gas

2663.28 --> 2668.6400000000003
yeah but it isn't

2665.76 --> 2669.8390000000004
because atmosphere in the root word

2668.64 --> 2672.7999999999997
means

2669.839 --> 2676.0789999999997
atmos gas sphere

2672.8 --> 2677.76
a globe it's a contradiction in terms

2677.76 --> 2682.7200000000003
we don't use that word i only use it by

accident and specifically when i'm

2682.72 --> 2688.72
talking about flat earth versus globe

2685.28 --> 2691.52
mechanical geometric arguments i do not

2688.72 --> 2693.359
use the word atmosphere

2691.52 --> 2697.2
and neither should you

2693.359 --> 2699.359
when dealing in this specific subject

2697.2 --> 2701.52
it's a bad

2699.359 --> 2702.839
bad word

2701.52 --> 2705.92
it's

2702.839 --> 2707.7599999999998
ridiculous if you figure out what you're

saying when you're saying it you're an

kind of a superiority figure

just letting him know he's a piece of

trash

3141.52 --> 3146.559
he is

3142.8 --> 3149.92
quite likely a [ __ ] or artist

3146.559 --> 3153.6800000000003
that is so incredibly [ __ ] annoying

3149.92 --> 3156.88
that not even a local social worker

3153.68 --> 3160.64
would spend his time and get paid to

3156.88 --> 3163.839
entertain him yeah that's how [ __ ]

3160.64 --> 3167.44
[ __ ] and terrible he is so instead

3163.839 --> 3169.68
he's going over here to bluff to all the

3169.68 --> 3173.1189999999997
actually

3170.72 --> 3176.0789999999997
competent in anything

which he isn't provably

yeah yeah [ __ ] useless [ __ ]

3222.559 --> 3226.8390000000004

i mean

this guy's probably worse

than sean hawkins

3287.28 --> 3291.3590000000004

anyone

3291.359 --> 3294.5589999999997
really

3292.64 --> 3296.799
that's why

3294.559 --> 3299.44
my recommendation of going back to the

3296.799 --> 3301.92
dirt is actually a positive

3299.44 --> 3305.28
recommendation i think it would truly be

3301.92 --> 3307.839
better for him and everybody else

3305.28 --> 3307.8390000000004
right

3323.359 --> 3330.64
a miserable anti-flat earther [ __ ]

3332.96 --> 3338.2400000000002
the only reason even i keep you around

3336.079 --> 3340.48
right now is because i feel a little

3338.24 --> 3342.72
miserable for very different reasons

3340.48 --> 3345.92
quite the opposite

3342.72 --> 3348.64
my life is quite inside out you know

3345.92 --> 3350.7200000000003
because actually being smart and taking

3348.64 --> 3351.839
a stand for your principles and your

3350.72 --> 3354.9599999999996

3351.839 --> 3354.96

i'm just using this useless piece of

3408.799 --> 3413.04
with the club all the time

3410.72 --> 3415.5989999999997
yeah well what if it turned out that

3413.04 --> 3417.7599999999998
chickens turn out to be cows

3415.599 --> 3419.44
or dolphins yeah yeah oh yeah then

3417.76 --> 3422.079
everything is different yeah yeah but it

3419.44 --> 3425.2000000000003
isn't a kumu virus

3422.079 --> 3427.52
because anti-fat earthers don't agree

3425.2 --> 3429.4399999999996
with the globe

3427.52 --> 3430.48
it's not going to turn out to be

different

3430.48 --> 3436.799
it's just straight out provable you can

3511.92 --> 3517.76
to even listen to a word you say

scatter gun it away from you

see

3546.16 --> 3554.5589999999997
he is just a conditioned little puppet

3550.96 --> 3558.64
you're too dumb to even think about the

the things that have been taught to you

3558.64 --> 3565.2799999999997
just i mean that is typical you only

3561.359 --> 3568.0
need 60 iq to basically just repeat what

3565.28 --> 3570.3190000000004
other people have told you

3568.0 --> 3572.319
right because to repeat like a parrot

3570.319 --> 3574.319
you don't literally need to understand

3572.319 --> 3575.7599999999998
even what you're saying you just repeat

3574.319 --> 3577.839
it and then

3575.76 --> 3579.44
pose like you're confident and then you

3577.839 --> 3581.359
think you're smart and there are other

3579.44 --> 3583.76
people that might be listening that are

3581.359 --> 3587.44
stupid enough might also actually think

3583.76 --> 3589.44
you're smart so that's like almost a win

3587.44 --> 3591.28
but you don't understand what the [ __ ]

3589.44 --> 3593.68
you're talking about because you don't

3591.28 --> 3596.1600000000003
even have the faculties or the

3593.68 --> 3599.44
discipline or the inner spirit of

3596.16 --> 3601.04
curiosity and inquiry to figure it out

3599.44 --> 3603.839
because you can't handle the truth

3601.04 --> 3606.24
because you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] grown up

3603.839 --> 3608.64
in a shitty world where nobody helped

3606.24 --> 3610.3999999999996
you and then you chose to not help

3608.64 --> 3612.799
yourself either

3610.4 --> 3614.7200000000003
and become a useless piece of [ __ ]

3612.799 --> 3617.68

it's too dumb to address jane it's the

3646.96 --> 3650.64
dumbest thing

3648.48 --> 3652.48
any person could say like

3650.64 --> 3655.92
an average

3652.48 --> 3657.76
relatively averagely smart six-year-old

3655.92 --> 3661.119

saying right now and like put their hand

3661.119 --> 3666.4
over their face in embarrassment in how

3663.68 --> 3668.5589999999997
incredibly dumb it is what you're just

3666.4 --> 3671.48
saying okay

3668.559 --> 3674.799
it's so dumb

3671.48 --> 3674.799
unbelievably dumb

3676.359 --> 3680.0
unbelievably dumb

3680.799 --> 3685.44
then answer it

it isn't your [ __ ] not

the stars always go

east to west

3691.119 --> 3695.76
everywhere

3692.559 --> 3698.88
when you look at the north

and when you look at the south

3698.88 --> 3703.119
they're not rotating in opposite

directions

3703.119 --> 3709.92
when you turn around

3706.64 --> 3712.92
it may appear to go in the other

3709.92 --> 3712.92
direction

3713.52 --> 3719.52
and then you would turn around again oh

3715.76 --> 3722.1600000000003
it appears to go in the other direction

3719.52 --> 3725.28
but it's actually going in the same

3722.16 --> 3727.799
direction you [ __ ] [ __ ]

you [ __ ]

enjoying me grilling for a bit

3759.44 --> 3763.92
i'm really hoping to score some paypal

3761.839 --> 3765.119
actually because yeah

3763.92 --> 3767.2000000000003
i might be

3765.119 --> 3770.799
an intellectual support superior

3767.2 --> 3773.2
superior by like 400 percent at least to

3770.799 --> 3775.599
this idiot and it's interesting to do

3773.2 --> 3780.0789999999997
this sometimes

3775.599 --> 3780.079
i do need money to actually get food

3781.599 --> 3785.119
yeah i know i made him cry or [ __ ] his

3783.52 --> 3787.28
pants right i don't think he can cry

3785.119 --> 3789.039
anymore because this world's just been

3787.28 --> 3790.88
too rough on him but i do think he

3789.039 --> 3793.88
probably shits his pants pretty

3790.88 --> 3793.88
regularly

3798.88 --> 3802.88
right which would be another

3800.319 --> 3804.64
contributing factor as to why

3802.88 --> 3807.799
like caretakers don't want to deal with

3804.64 --> 3807.799
him anymore

3816.03 --> 3821.599

3819.2 --> 3823.9199999999996

3821.599 --> 3826.559
can still get you some sympathy somebody

3823.92 --> 3828.0
[ __ ] their pants

3826.559 --> 3829.44
no

3828.0 --> 3831.76
not so much

3829.44 --> 3831.76
huh

3837.599 --> 3841.6800000000003
no one would hire me

3839.68 --> 3843.5989999999997
except the last time

3841.68 --> 3845.839
when i looked for a job and they did

3843.599 --> 3847.6800000000003
hire me which was the last time that i

3845.839 --> 3848.96
tried after that i didn't want to try

3847.68 --> 3850.0789999999997
anymore

3848.96 --> 3851.039
yeah

3850.079 --> 3854.1600000000003
also

3851.039 --> 3856.3190000000004
this is officially a paying job i mean

3854.16 --> 3857.52
it's not like a full income but it is a

3856.319 --> 3860.5589999999997
job

3857.52 --> 3860.559
i'm not jobless

3861.039 --> 3866.559
so you're just wrong right but yeah that

3864.24 --> 3868.64
doesn't make me rich or anything

3866.559 --> 3869.52
and i don't mind because i'd rather be

3868.64 --> 3873.2799999999997
poor

3869.52 --> 3877.359
than a [ __ ] detrimental loser that

3873.28 --> 3877.3590000000004
everybody hates like you

3879.44 --> 3886.64
and it's not a bluff that is a serious

3882.72 --> 3886.64
very refined assessment

3886.72 --> 3891.0389999999998
i'd be i'd be poor

3889.359 --> 3894.16
and smart

3891.039 --> 3897.6800000000003
over a [ __ ] useless [ __ ] that

3894.16 --> 3900.0789999999997
everybody hates any day of the year

3897.68 --> 3902.96
whether you're rich or you're not rich

3900.079 --> 3905.8390000000004
doesn't even matter in the face of that

3902.96 --> 3909.359
i'd just be anything else

3905.839 --> 3912.5589999999997
if it as long as it's not like you shane

3909.359 --> 3912.5589999999997
so i'm doing fine

3912.64 --> 3917.16
what

3913.76 --> 3917.1600000000003
yeah huh

3928.48 --> 3933.2
right but anyway

3930.16 --> 3933.2
if you like what i'm doing

3933.359 --> 3938.5589999999997
please donate to my paypal i really need

3935.839 --> 3942.52
the money for food as in i would like to

3938.559 --> 3950.0

3954.24 --> 3959.0389999999998

3956.799 --> 3959.0389999999998
this

3959.68 --> 3966.319
get into this [ __ ] talk

3962.96 --> 3966.319
then you can let me know

3966.48 --> 3971.359
as long as you're actually a person that

3968.72 --> 3974.0
is a regular visitor and not some random

3971.359 --> 3974.0
stock account

3975.76 --> 3979.8390000000004
and

3977.039 --> 3979.8390000000004
yeah

3979.92 --> 3986.16
if you donate regularly that does con

3982.0 --> 3986.16
that does actually give you more weight

3987.92 --> 3991.88
spiritually that is

3994.799 --> 3998.559
right

3996.0 --> 4001.76
but yeah today i just i just had to do

3998.559 --> 4001.76
this i just had to

4002.0 --> 4007.039
pick this piece of [ __ ]

4005.039 --> 4010.2400000000002
basically start scrubbing it from the

4007.039 --> 4012.4
toilet until it's gone because somebody

4010.24 --> 4014.319
has to

4012.4 --> 4017.28
get real

4014.319 --> 4020.48
even about these scumbags

4017.28 --> 4024.079
every now and then

4020.48 --> 4026.2400000000002
right you gotta let them know

4024.079 --> 4028.079
that they can still be hurt and then

4026.24 --> 4030.16
they can pretend all day long like

4028.079 --> 4031.52
they're not but they're still gonna show

4030.16 --> 4032.64
exactly

4031.52 --> 4035.44
how much

4032.64 --> 4039.2
they're hurt you see every

4035.44 --> 4042.0
laughing crying smiley

4039.2 --> 4046.5589999999997
that's literally them crying

4042.0 --> 4049.52
the amount it hurt is directly

4046.559 --> 4053.599
directly linearly expressed in the

4049.52 --> 4056.72
amount of crying laffy emojis so four

4053.599 --> 4058.2400000000002
crying laughing emojis means that that

4056.72 --> 4059.839
kind of hurt

4058.24 --> 4062.319
right

4059.839 --> 4064.16
now six that means that it hurt even

4062.319 --> 4066.64
more and if it goes out of control that

4064.16 --> 4068.16
means that he's basically like losing

4066.64 --> 4070.799
his mind

4068.16 --> 4074.0789999999997
right hysterical laughter

4070.799 --> 4077.92
is a strategical way to cover up

4074.079 --> 4081.2000000000003
absolute love losing misery

4077.92 --> 4082.079
which i know this guy has i i i brought

4081.2 --> 4084.5589999999997
it up

4082.079 --> 4088.4
huh i brought it up described it in

4084.559 --> 4090.559
detail laid it down painful and all

4088.4 --> 4094.2400000000002
because sometimes you got to get real

4090.559 --> 4095.76
with these goblin pieces of [ __ ]

4094.24 --> 4097.12
you just gotta

4095.76 --> 4098.88
show that

4097.12 --> 4103.08
to them

4098.88 --> 4103.08
what they actually are

4105.839 --> 4111.5199999999995
right because in doing so

4108.08 --> 4114.799
even though the chances are almost zero

4111.52 --> 4116.319
they could potentially

4114.799 --> 4118.56
realize

4116.319 --> 4121.1990000000005
that they still have a chance of not

4118.56 --> 4122.319
being that [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] scumbag

4121.199 --> 4125.2789999999995
every day

4122.319 --> 4128.400000000001
and become a halfway respected person

4125.279 --> 4131.359
halfway not gonna give you much more

4128.4 --> 4134.159
but if you would become that i'd be like

4131.359 --> 4137.120000000001
ecstatic over it not expecting you to

4134.159 --> 4140.799
become that but what if right that's my

4137.12 --> 4142.799
gambling i gamble on [ __ ] pieces [ __ ]

4140.799 --> 4145.679
scumbags

4142.799 --> 4148.08
in like this gambler's miraculous hope

4145.679 --> 4150.0
that somehow my light

4148.08 --> 4152.88
will burn at their

4150.0 --> 4154.64
most essential core elements in ways

4152.88 --> 4157.1990000000005
that they couldn't even understand what

4154.64 --> 4159.279
the [ __ ] is going on

4157.199 --> 4164.3189999999995
so that it might

4159.279 --> 4164.319
might potentially turn around somehow

4165.199 --> 4168.5599999999995
i sometimes i gotta believe in that

4167.04 --> 4170.799
because

4168.56 --> 4173.52
i used to be like that

4170.799 --> 4174.4
well not as disgusting and [ __ ] as

4173.52 --> 4176.88
this guy

4174.4 --> 4179.599999999999
but i used to be pretty nasty at times

4176.88 --> 4180.719
purely born out of insecurity about

4179.6 --> 4183.92
myself

4180.719 --> 4183.92
i was bluffing a lot

4184.96 --> 4190.2390000000005
right now i don't need to bluff anymore

4188.239 --> 4191.04
i've grown into

4190.239 --> 4193.839
the

4191.04 --> 4195.6
challenge that i've taken i've accepted

4193.839 --> 4198.5599999999995
a level of

4195.6 --> 4199.679
engagement spiritually and i've grown

4198.56 --> 4202.080000000001
into it

4199.679 --> 4205.4400000000005
i was always gonna go there but i wanted

4202.08 --> 4207.12
to already be there when i was young and

4205.44 --> 4209.36
so i bluffed it

4207.12 --> 4212.0
and then sometimes people did the same

4209.36 --> 4214.4
thing that i'm doing right now to me

4212.0 --> 4217.76
they'd get all the way to my core

4214.4 --> 4220.4
and it'd be like holy [ __ ] you actually

4217.76 --> 4222.88
like call it out exactly

4220.4 --> 4226.08
right and then i wouldn't act like this

4222.88 --> 4227.84
piece of [ __ ] troll with smiley laugh

4226.08 --> 4230.96
even

4227.84 --> 4234.400000000001
it's still wrong

4230.96 --> 4238.08
i'm so convincing please believe i'm

4234.4 --> 4240.879999999999
laughing and all ecstatic please

4238.08 --> 4244.48
right yeah i wouldn't do that

4240.88 --> 4246.96
i just immediately show humility

4244.48 --> 4250.0
like fall on the knees level and i'm

4246.96 --> 4253.28
talking face-to-face situation not

4250.0 --> 4254.4
over the internet

4253.28 --> 4256.4
right

4254.4 --> 4259.36
because i i'd used to do this sort of

4256.4 --> 4262.08
intense conversations face to face when

4259.36 --> 4266.08
i was younger everybody did that before

4262.08 --> 4268.239
the freaking mobile phones ruined it all

4266.08 --> 4270.4
yeah and then when somebody would face

4268.239 --> 4272.718999999999
me with like a brutal error because i

4270.4 --> 4274.639999999999
used to be a baller don't forget

4272.719 --> 4276.8
i would do that sort of weird thing and

4274.64 --> 4278.88
like oh this could still be a ball

4276.8 --> 4281.52
but if somebody would then ram it in my

4278.88 --> 4284.96
face like no dude it's flat

4281.52 --> 4286.4800000000005
i'd be like [ __ ] you're right

4284.96 --> 4289.52
but i'm still going to believe it's a

4286.48 --> 4291.678999999999
ball for now because i'm not ready yet

4289.52 --> 4293.52
i still want to enjoy this dream as if

4291.679 --> 4296.64
it is real

4293.52 --> 4298.0
i would literally say it to them like

4296.64 --> 4301.92
that

4298.0 --> 4304.88
and then i'd forget about it huh huh

4301.92 --> 4307.28
yeah you can't do that huh kanye [ __ ]

4304.88 --> 4309.84
that's not that's not within your mental

4307.28 --> 4312.48
capable range is it huh

4309.84 --> 4317.2390000000005
yeah i know it sucks to be you doesn't

4312.48 --> 4317.239
it shane it sucks to be you bro

4323.22 --> 4326.909000000001
[Music]

4331.9 --> 4335.099999999999
[Music]

4335.36 --> 4338.36
so

4350.6 --> 4353.669000000001
[Music]

4367.28 --> 4373.199
nah i think that shane's probably off to

4370.64 --> 4373.1990000000005
the toilet

4373.6 --> 4378.8
it might be taking a little bit longer

4375.52 --> 4378.8
than he had anticipated

4382.4 --> 4387.679
anyhow i'm done with that [ __ ] with

4385.04 --> 4390.48
made my point showed what i can do how

4387.679 --> 4392.88
hard i can be

4390.48 --> 4395.04
and at the same time still need paypal

4392.88 --> 4397.679
donations yeah and then it looks like oh

4395.04 --> 4401.76
wow is this guy actually asking money

4397.679 --> 4405.679
for bullying retards on the internet

4401.76 --> 4408.719
yeah in a way i am

4405.679 --> 4410.32
i mean i don't like to do that

4408.719 --> 4413.199
but

4410.32 --> 4414.0
i mean i do get the trolls

4413.199 --> 4416.639999999999
so

4414.0 --> 4416.64
why not

4416.96 --> 4422.64
i think just sitting through it and

4419.36 --> 4424.239
letting it all happen would be better

4422.64 --> 4427.76
right other people are going to be

4424.239 --> 4431.199
facing trolls i bet that other people

4427.76 --> 4434.2390000000005
would like to have some skill level to

4431.199 --> 4436.5599999999995
deal with it similar to what i have well

4434.239 --> 4439.799999999999
the only way i could give it to them is

4436.56 --> 4439.8
by demonstration

4442.719 --> 4446.96
you had to throw me some bucks for

4444.32 --> 4448.5599999999995
bullying a [ __ ]

4446.96 --> 4451.36
okay

4448.56 --> 4454.8
by the way for disclaimer i don't

4451.36 --> 4457.36
actually bull bully retards

4454.8 --> 4459.4400000000005
only just really stupid

4457.36 --> 4460.48
stubborn people

4459.44 --> 4461.839999999999
right

4460.48 --> 4464.5599999999995
i mean

4461.84 --> 4466.719
people that are clinically [ __ ]

4464.56 --> 4468.88
they're often born that way

4466.719 --> 4470.4800000000005
or they've been vaccine damaged or

4468.88 --> 4472.64
something terrible

4470.48 --> 4473.759999999999
i'm not picking at you i would never do

4472.64 --> 4475.679
that

4473.76 --> 4477.12
unless you were like demonically

4475.679 --> 4479.52
possessed and

4477.12 --> 4481.36
trying to bully me

4479.52 --> 4485.360000000001
right which is what is happening right

4481.36 --> 4486.32
here and i'm just doing it right back

4485.36 --> 4490.04
it is

4486.32 --> 4490.04
hostile psychoanalysis

4490.08 --> 4493.5199999999995
part of my skill range

4494.32 --> 4499.199
but i don't mean retards actual retards

4497.679 --> 4501.1990000000005
any bad

4499.199 --> 4502.879999999999
and a lot of them are actually really

4501.199 --> 4505.44
nice

4502.88 --> 4508.159000000001
why because they don't get caught up in

4505.44 --> 4511.36
mental complications they tend to be a

4508.159 --> 4513.36
little bit more basic and thus

4511.36 --> 4516.239
listen to their senses their inner

4513.36 --> 4517.759999999999
intuitive senses a little more

4516.239 --> 4519.5199999999995
right

4517.76 --> 4522.719
so i actually

4519.52 --> 4525.120000000001
on average like retards more

4522.719 --> 4528.4800000000005
than people that think they're really

4525.12 --> 4531.599999999999
smart but are just constantly gamming

4528.48 --> 4532.639999999999
out on the internet i hate those people

4531.6 --> 4536.400000000001
i like

4532.64 --> 4536.400000000001
regular retards a lot better

4536.56 --> 4541.6
and at least like regular retards have a

4539.12 --> 4543.599999999999
lot of drive in them right they they

4541.6 --> 4545.76
like to work they like to do a labor

4543.6 --> 4548.2390000000005
that's good that's awesome

4545.76 --> 4550.400000000001
gammas typically don't

4548.239 --> 4552.4
they don't like to do that

4550.4 --> 4554.96
just like to make other people's lives

4552.4 --> 4554.96
miserable

4560.4 --> 4566.599999999999
you're a regular [ __ ] okay that's cool

4563.199 --> 4566.599999999999
good for you

4573.6 --> 4576.6
hmm

4580.0 --> 4585.199
thank you

4581.28 --> 4588.0
bex is it dex thank you

4585.199 --> 4590.639999999999
oh yeah was it the

4588.0 --> 4593.36
yeah for the paypal donation

4590.64 --> 4597.0
neil degrasse tyson lies

4593.36 --> 4597.0
thank you very much

4611.199 --> 4616.44
anymore for any more

4612.96 --> 4616.44
that will be great

4652.4 --> 4658.239
there are only three there's five

4655.199 --> 4658.239
as far as i can see

4663.199 --> 4669.199
now seven

4665.84 --> 4669.1990000000005
so yeah i don't eight

4669.36 --> 4673.36
right it doesn't mean that's gonna stay

4671.12 --> 4675.92
that way though it might might be all

4673.36 --> 4679.48
like rolled down after the show is over

4675.92 --> 4679.4800000000005
they do that sometimes

4682.88 --> 4687.28
don't you get worried about going hungry

4684.719 --> 4689.36
when you're low on funds yeah yeah i am

4687.28 --> 4691.199
bobby steals

4689.36 --> 4693.759999999999
that's the point that's why i'm asking

4691.199 --> 4696.0
for paypal donations i mean it's

4693.76 --> 4699.04
trying to like oh make it funny or

4696.0 --> 4701.199
whatever but i i do actually need it

4699.04 --> 4703.92
like a lot

4701.199 --> 4706.159
i have been for a while

4703.92 --> 4708.4
i'm not doing great financially right

4706.159 --> 4711.04
now i think that the amount of donations

4708.4 --> 4713.199
i've received like in the last months is

4711.04 --> 4716.4
like half

4713.199 --> 4719.879999999999
of all the months before that

4716.4 --> 4719.879999999999
it's been terrible

4720.48 --> 4725.718999999999
i'm running into debt

4722.4 --> 4725.719
and problems

4746.96 --> 4751.12
okay that sucks youtube

4748.96 --> 4753.52
well the prices haven't gone up that

4751.12 --> 4755.76
much yet

4753.52 --> 4759.719
wouldn't surprise if eventually it would

4755.76 --> 4759.719
i really hope it won't

4764.64 --> 4769.679
but yeah it might be necessary if like

4767.76 --> 4770.96
dutch farmers are

4769.679 --> 4774.08
gonna

4770.96 --> 4776.32
yeah they're gonna have to win right so

4774.08 --> 4778.719
and there will probably probably be

4776.32 --> 4780.48
price calamities and when that happens

4778.719 --> 4783.44
i'm gonna be hungry for a while pretty

4780.48 --> 4783.44
much no matter what

4785.76 --> 4789.8
do i smoke yeah

4814.08 --> 4819.84
okay that that sounds great akuma virus

4816.8 --> 4819.84
i think

4824.719 --> 4830.68
it's a lot of money is going yeah well i

4827.36 --> 4832.0
don't smoke that much really

4830.68 --> 4835.12
[Music]

4832.0 --> 4836.639
i'm not a chain smoker by a long shot a

4835.12 --> 4838.88
god

4836.639 --> 4838.88
right

4845.12 --> 4850.639
so i i don't like run into those types

4848.08 --> 4852.88
of situations anymore where i'm like oh

4850.639 --> 4854.639
i need to smoke or something no thank

4852.88 --> 4859.639
god i don't

4854.639 --> 4859.639
so i'm not too worried about that

4860.639 --> 4866.639
but i have just a lot of

4863.52 --> 4868.639
standard costs on all sides like my rent

4866.639 --> 4872.0
which has gone up

4868.639 --> 4872.0
rent for my storage

4872.159 --> 4878.48
the rest is just all food it's like all

4875.28 --> 4878.48
of it is food

4878.56 --> 4881.76
everything

4879.679 --> 4884.2390000000005
and a bunch of smokes

4881.76 --> 4887.400000000001
that's it that's like my expenditure all

4884.239 --> 4887.4
of it

4893.84 --> 4903.84
gross bobby that's just gross

4897.22 --> 4906.88
[Music]

4903.84 --> 4906.88
that's just terrible

4908.239 --> 4913.839999999999
right but guys i

4910.48 --> 4917.5599999999995
gonna do it again i i could really use

4913.84 --> 4917.56
some paypal donation

4917.76 --> 4921.360000000001
i hope i'm still worth it i mean i have

4920.0 --> 4924.639
been

4921.36 --> 4926.5599999999995
still contributing using my intellect

4924.639 --> 4930.56
flat earth debate

4926.56 --> 4932.96
concepts out here

4930.56 --> 4935.120000000001

4932.96 --> 4936.719
growth spiritual growth and challenge

4935.12 --> 4939.12
both

4936.719 --> 4941.36
i mean what else can i do

4939.12 --> 4942.8
except for completely rearrange

4941.36 --> 4945.36
everything and become a totally

4942.8 --> 4947.84
different type of show

4945.36 --> 4949.36
which will absolutely not guarantee me

4947.84 --> 4952.0
making more money

4949.36 --> 4952.0
at this point

4954.32 --> 4958.599999999999
at least not on the short run

4972.48 --> 4977.12
20 a day jesus

4974.719 --> 4982.12
cute

4977.12 --> 4982.12

use raw tobacco leaf at a time like some

4998.88 --> 5002.96
time ago it's not it's like a year ago

5001.36 --> 5005.839999999999
now

5002.96 --> 5008.2390000000005
that was great it worked really well but

5005.84 --> 5010.32
yeah that cost me like it's gonna cost

5008.239 --> 5012.5599999999995
me like 200 euros to do that and then

5010.32 --> 5015.199
i'll have like an entire year worth of

5012.56 --> 5018.400000000001
tobacco for that

5015.199 --> 5018.4
as soon as it arrives

5020.48 --> 5026.799999999999
but yeah it hasn't really come to that

5024.159 --> 5032.599999999999
i do want to do it again but i

5026.8 --> 5032.6
do that just can't afford it at all

5084.48 --> 5090.239
you know that when i do

5087.04 --> 5095.719

5191.199 --> 5195.678999999999
war on their hands

5193.52 --> 5199.2390000000005

notice the first my freaking stomach man

5234.719 --> 5237.36
like

5237.36 --> 5242.0
i have stomach issues and financial

5240.239 --> 5244.5599999999995
stress seems to be like a great

5242.0 --> 5247.44
detriment to that because it always gets

5244.56 --> 5251.4400000000005
a lot worse when i am like in financial

5247.44 --> 5254.08
trouble always it happens

5251.44 --> 5256.719
sometimes when i lose track i can almost

5254.08 --> 5259.04
just like

5256.719 --> 5261.199
feel out what my stomach is like in

5259.04 --> 5264.32
order to try and predict how much

5261.199 --> 5266.0
financial trouble i'm actually in as i'm

5264.32 --> 5269.12
keeping it out of my consciousness and

like just realize that

5661.6 --> 5667.04
each of you now multiple people having

put just a couple of bucks

5667.04 --> 5673.199

up so like i thank you so much like this

5673.199 --> 5678.96

5693.679 --> 5699.2390000000005
when you actually really needed it for

5695.84 --> 5699.2390000000005
something important

5700.159 --> 5705.36
but if you got some maneuvering room i

5702.639 --> 5706.96
could really use the support right

5705.36 --> 5708.5599999999995
that's how i see i don't want to get

5706.96 --> 5712.199
somebody's last dime that would just

5708.56 --> 5712.1990000000005
make me feel terrible

5726.88 --> 5729.84
right

5733.76 --> 5737.119000000001
anyway

5735.44 --> 5738.0
yeah we still got

5737.119 --> 5739.599999999999
for

5738.0 --> 5742.6
25 minutes

5739.6 --> 5742.6
so

5744.719 --> 5749.6
i'm not talking about the troll again

5746.48 --> 5751.839999999999
seems he has actually left anyway

5749.6 --> 5754.08
good

5751.84 --> 5754.08
uh

5755.52 --> 5759.080000000001
what could i address

5786.88 --> 5789.679
that weird

5791.199 --> 5796.0
i'm getting let very little information

5793.76 --> 5797.76
about all this situation

5796.0 --> 5800.48
all these situations out there in the

5797.76 --> 5802.88
world like sri lanka and

5800.48 --> 5804.32
president former president abbey from

5802.88 --> 5806.400000000001
japan

5804.32 --> 5810.159
but it's just like i'm getting u.s

5806.4 --> 5813.119
accusations like oh yeah

5810.159 --> 5815.04
that was done by the chinese of course

5813.119 --> 5817.759999999999
okay

5815.04 --> 5819.679
what's the actual lead for that

5817.76 --> 5821.92
i mean i don't even know the name of the

5819.679 --> 5824.159
guy that supposedly did that and like

5821.92 --> 5826.96
what's going on here and now sri lanka

5824.159 --> 5829.199
is supposedly incited by russia they're

5826.96 --> 5832.4800000000005
really going there

5829.199 --> 5835.44
but i'm just not getting

5832.48 --> 5839.159
info as to exactly the background of

5835.44 --> 5839.159
what's going on

5841.76 --> 5847.1990000000005
i mean sri lanka seems solid enough but

5844.0 --> 5849.04
with abe it's like i don't know

5847.199 --> 5850.879999999999
i don't think it's a good thing i mean

5849.04 --> 5853.119
yeah he was a world economic forum

5850.88 --> 5854.719
visitor but i thought it might be

5853.119 --> 5856.799999999999
mistaken

5854.719 --> 5859.52
that he was actually kind of a nice

5856.8 --> 5861.76
politician for a politician i mean not

5859.52 --> 5863.1990000000005
perfect by a long shot he

5861.76 --> 5865.04
he did have like

5863.199 --> 5866.799999999999
kind of bad connections here and there

5865.04 --> 5868.4
as well

5866.8 --> 5870.4800000000005
but he always seemed like

5868.4 --> 5873.28
a really good guy that was actually

5870.48 --> 5875.44
trying to do his best for his country

5873.28 --> 5876.719
so

5875.44 --> 5878.96
yeah

5876.719 --> 5883.84
i don't see like him

5878.96 --> 5883.84
that happening like a good thing at all

5884.239 --> 5890.0
it's a very sad thing actually i think

5887.84 --> 5892.400000000001
but i don't know right i did i don't

5890.0 --> 5895.199
know what he got himself into exactly i

5892.4 --> 5896.719
don't know who did it like maybe it was

5895.199 --> 5899.599999999999
freaking china

5896.719 --> 5901.52
doing that or maybe something else

5899.6 --> 5903.679
i don't know i still

5901.52 --> 5907.88
i'm still kind of in the dark about

5903.679 --> 5907.88
the background info on this

5911.679 --> 5915.679
all right yes sri lanka interesting

5917.199 --> 5920.08
right

5918.639 --> 5923.08
it all depends on where it's going to

5920.08 --> 5923.08
lead

5925.76 --> 5930.719
can't really watch things like the news

5928.08 --> 5934.639
yeah i know akuma fires me neither it's

5930.719 --> 5934.639
just it's so much garbage

5936.32 --> 5942.4
i mean like the regular mainstream news

5939.36 --> 5942.4
is starting to

5943.199 --> 5948.5599999999995
outgrow the terribleness

5946.4 --> 5950.839999999999
of like what nasa is doing like they're

5948.56 --> 5953.119000000001
getting worse than

5950.84 --> 5956.92
nasa that's

5953.119 --> 5956.92
a frightening prospect

5978.239 --> 5981.239

5981.679 --> 5984.56
are you talking about

5989.199 --> 5993.879999999999

6106.88 --> 6111.1990000000005
like sort of part of the mainstream but

6109.119 --> 6114.4
like against the mainstream and they're

6111.199 --> 6116.638999999999
being banned and censored and barraged

6114.4 --> 6118.638999999999
legally from all sides

6116.639 --> 6120.88
but they are like a controlled

6118.639 --> 6122.8
alternative media that's actually really

6120.88 --> 6126.96
trying to be alternative i've seen more

6122.8 --> 6128.8
of these groups pop up around the world

6126.96 --> 6132.04

6286.239 --> 6292.08
that guy is like

6289.6 --> 6295.04
like way overkill

6295.04 --> 6301.36
yeah he was a pretty he was really being

6298.159 --> 6302.96
pretty badass comedian

6301.36 --> 6305.119

hey rick back good to see you

6376.8 --> 6381.84
yeah susie yes yeah but look sri lanka

6379.679 --> 6384.96
india

6381.84 --> 6387.679
there's a big difference with the west

6384.96 --> 6389.36
because they do actually beat the [ __ ]

6387.679 --> 6390.639
out of their politicians when things

6389.36 --> 6392.239
goes out

6390.639 --> 6394.8
like they really do

6392.239 --> 6397.28
so yeah that's probably gonna happen it

6394.8 --> 6401.8
might get pretty bloody too

6397.28 --> 6401.8
you never really know until it's done

6436.4 --> 6439.4
huh

6452.56 --> 6455.88

6473.36 --> 6476.239
oh that guy

6476.8 --> 6479.8
um

6484.0 --> 6488.8
i don't know man like

6486.08 --> 6490.96
in this day and age there is no comedian

6488.8 --> 6492.96
out there in the mainstream that i like

6490.96 --> 6495.52
not a single one

6492.96 --> 6496.84
i mean like really not a single one i

6495.52 --> 6498.719
think they're all

6496.84 --> 6502.0
atrocious not

6498.719 --> 6504.56
kind of funny no atrocious they all suck

6502.0 --> 6506.48
they all are silencing themselves and

6504.56 --> 6508.88
not saying things

6506.48 --> 6510.879999999999
that they know would be funny and

6508.88 --> 6513.84
they're just not doing it all of them

6510.88 --> 6513.84
they all suck

6521.44 --> 6526.719
i mean if i want to watch comedy now i'm

6523.52 --> 6528.88
just going to watch own benjamin

6526.719 --> 6531.36
does it every day

6528.88 --> 6534.8
i mean it's not as compacted as a full

6531.36 --> 6539.119
comedy skit in a stand-up comedian

6534.8 --> 6540.88
the stand-up podium situation but

6539.119 --> 6542.88
it is still

6540.88 --> 6545.28
like on target

6542.88 --> 6546.56
and it's funny as like he

6545.28 --> 6549.04
own benjamin

6546.56 --> 6550.8
literally just discovers jokes on the

6549.04 --> 6553.9
spot

6550.8 --> 6555.360000000001
so you can literally see him working

6553.9 --> 6557.119
[Music]

6555.36 --> 6559.28
instead of just only seeing the end

6557.119 --> 6561.199

6559.28 --> 6562.719
see

6561.199 --> 6564.638999999999
comedians

6562.719 --> 6566.719
you get to see their end result you

6564.639 --> 6569.36
don't even get to see how like how

6566.719 --> 6570.88
they're doing it with own benjamin you

6569.36 --> 6574.159
can

6570.88 --> 6574.159000000001
does it right there live

6574.56 --> 6577.88
that's interesting

6589.679 --> 6594.32
yeah correct rick beck

6591.76 --> 6594.320000000001
that's right

6594.96 --> 6601.52
i mean life improv stand up

6599.36 --> 6603.759999999999
you could do that he does it every

6601.52 --> 6605.599
freaking day that's crazy there's no

6603.76 --> 6607.679
other comedian that's ever even tried

6605.599 --> 6609.52
that out

6607.679 --> 6611.36
right

6609.52 --> 6612.159000000001
successfully that is

6611.36 --> 6613.92
uh

6612.159 --> 6616.799999999999
jim royer yeah

6613.92 --> 6620.0
i've seen like oh benjamin on with jim

6616.8 --> 6621.4400000000005
broyer so i know him through that

6620.0 --> 6625.599
but he's

6621.44 --> 6625.598999999999
yeah then he sold old vacuuming out

6633.36 --> 6637.759999999999
sort of it like

6635.119 --> 6642.5199999999995
cocked out more

6637.76 --> 6642.52
and not sold them out that's too much

6659.119 --> 6663.32
all right

6660.32 --> 6663.32
cool

6674.639 --> 6678.679
right so yeah

6684.08 --> 6687.2789999999995
[Music]

6690.4 --> 6696.239
by the way if you like comedy in general

6693.36 --> 6698.719
i mean made by gymbop is freaking

6696.239 --> 6700.4
hilarious at times

6698.719 --> 6702.8
when it just kind of works when the

6700.4 --> 6705.36
chemistry just works and then he's just

6702.8 --> 6709.1990000000005
gonna be like uh like i've been laughing

6705.36 --> 6710.239
my ass off at times when jim bob's is

6709.199 --> 6712.799999999999
like

6710.239 --> 6716.879999999999
reviewing something or somebody or even

6712.8 --> 6716.88
a comment it's hilarious

6717.36 --> 6721.28
i think yeah i mean owen benjamin also

6719.76 --> 6722.400000000001
does that

6721.28 --> 6724.5599999999995
understand

6722.4 --> 6726.879999999999
yeah maybe it's because with jim bob

6724.56 --> 6730.2390000000005
he's like not

6726.88 --> 6734.0
pushing himself to constantly do it

6730.239 --> 6734.0
when he does it it's just hilarious

6734.56 --> 6739.04
because owen really does have like an

6736.719 --> 6740.32
everyday everyday

6739.04 --> 6743.36
schedule

6740.32 --> 6745.5199999999995
kind of like what i have and that's much

6743.36 --> 6749.28
it's a different situation when you have

6745.52 --> 6752.639
to do it every day according to your own

6749.28 --> 6752.639
plan or challenge

6760.639 --> 6764.8
but yeah this jim royer guy i don't know

6762.56 --> 6767.52
much about him he seems like a hyper

6764.8 --> 6767.52
active kind of

6767.92 --> 6770.8
comedian guy

6777.28 --> 6783.28
yeah jordan peterson

6779.92 --> 6784.88
he's got a lot of voices but

6783.28 --> 6786.8
you mean

6784.88 --> 6788.96
ben shipyroo

6786.8 --> 6792.639
i mean his ben shapiro voice is like the

6788.96 --> 6794.08
funniest ever combined with this dawkins

6792.639 --> 6795.92
voice

6794.08 --> 6799.44
like those are the moments where i can't

6795.92 --> 6799.4400000000005
stop laughing when that happens

6804.96 --> 6810.32
you see evolution you see yeah

6808.639 --> 6813.28
i can't do it like him

6810.32 --> 6813.28
he's too good at it

6813.36 --> 6816.719
yeah yeah

6815.199 --> 6818.879999999999
but it is just

6816.719 --> 6823.8
very funny i could train it but it's his

6818.88 --> 6823.8
thing i got my own voices

6848.8 --> 6852.56
dude

6849.92 --> 6853.599
i can't lo dude woke

6852.56 --> 6856.639
uh

6853.599 --> 6858.32
well like who cares man woke is

6856.639 --> 6861.52
is

6858.32 --> 6864.5599999999995
woke right now is the emperor skeksi on

6861.52 --> 6866.0
his deathbed i mean it like it's about

6864.56 --> 6869.360000000001
to go

6866.0 --> 6872.0
it is really really dead

6869.36 --> 6874.48
it's gonna go

6872.0 --> 6877.04
i mean if you freaking can't stand

6874.48 --> 6879.36
broken just watch akira man

6877.04 --> 6882.0
i mean like

6879.36 --> 6883.199
watch it

6882.0 --> 6886.56
i can't

6883.199 --> 6889.199
it is like the most freaking

6886.56 --> 6890.88
anti-woke movie

6889.199 --> 6891.759999999999
ever seen

6890.88 --> 6895.599
but

6891.76 --> 6898.8
it really it kind of is and it

6895.599 --> 6901.04
it probably was meant to but it if it's

6898.8 --> 6901.04
just

6902.84 --> 6909.599
ah it's so traditional in ways it's like

6907.92 --> 6913.04
a traditionalist

6909.599 --> 6913.04
vision of the future

6913.599 --> 6918.56
with a lot of spirit

6915.44 --> 6922.159
and a lot of passion

6918.56 --> 6923.92
and a lot of sharpness of mind

6922.159 --> 6926.5599999999995
and they have no freaking mobiles i

6923.92 --> 6928.159
can't like that's probably even the most

6926.56 --> 6931.1990000000005
impactful thing about it is they're

6928.159 --> 6934.32
showing like a future where there is no

6931.199 --> 6934.32
mobile phones

6936.159 --> 6939.759999999999
that's just

6938.0 --> 6942.0
it's it's like

6939.76 --> 6942.0
like

6943.36 --> 6950.239
lost knowledge of the future that never

6946.0 --> 6953.679
was could we get it back could we get

6950.239 --> 6955.678999999999
that element back the no more phones

6953.679 --> 6957.119
could we get it back you can get a

6955.679 --> 6959.76
glimpse

6957.119 --> 6964.0
of it a potential

6959.76 --> 6967.1990000000005
element still keen to watch it

6964.0 --> 6971.199
okay susie s but you gotta realize it is

6967.199 --> 6973.199
the scariest movie i have ever seen

6971.199 --> 6977.199
so

6973.199 --> 6979.919999999999
just if you just realize that that like

6977.199 --> 6982.5599999999995
it's going to be very freaky and you

6979.92 --> 6984.639
could like be like oh just like not put

6982.56 --> 6986.8
the volume up and just kind of like

6984.639 --> 6988.88
watch half paying it well then you just

6986.8 --> 6992.2390000000005
missed the entire experience

6988.88 --> 6992.2390000000005
i watched it like

6992.96 --> 6998.2390000000005
in a dark room with television screen

6996.08 --> 6999.84
like in front of me that's how i watched

6998.239 --> 7002.32
it

6999.84 --> 7005.119000000001
like totally getting absorbed in it

7002.32 --> 7006.239
because it is suitable to do that it's

7005.119 --> 7008.5599999999995
just

7006.239 --> 7011.839999999999
you kind of got to be a man to do it

7008.56 --> 7014.4800000000005
because it's [ __ ] scary man

7011.84 --> 7016.719
when you do that when you actually allow

7014.48 --> 7018.799999999999
your empathy to kind of get a grip on it

7016.719 --> 7020.4
it's scary

7018.8 --> 7023.1990000000005
so

7020.4 --> 7025.199
in general i will stick to my

7023.199 --> 7027.28
my general recommendation for it and

7025.199 --> 7029.919999999999
that is if you are a lady and you've

7027.28 --> 7032.32
never seen this before and you haven't

7029.92 --> 7035.679
not completely spoiled yourself the

7032.32 --> 7038.239
satanic all [ __ ] by watching terrible

7035.679 --> 7040.56
horror manga

7038.239 --> 7042.799999999999
anime movies there's really terrible

7040.56 --> 7044.96
[ __ ] out there that's just disgusting

7042.8 --> 7046.8
well if you haven't completely destroyed

7044.96 --> 7048.639
yourself watching all that because that

7046.8 --> 7050.56
does happen

7048.639 --> 7052.159000000001
i've seen it

7050.56 --> 7055.280000000001
if you've never seen it

7052.159 --> 7057.679
watch it the first time with a man

7055.28 --> 7060.5599999999995
or even better like your man

7057.679 --> 7063.679
because you're gonna need it

7060.56 --> 7065.4400000000005
it's [ __ ] scary man

7063.679 --> 7066.88
and impressive

7065.44 --> 7069.28
it's just gonna be better for you if you

7066.88 --> 7069.28
do that

7070.239 --> 7075.5199999999995
because also it is it is really like

7073.52 --> 7077.360000000001
aimed at

7075.52 --> 7080.0
young adults at

7077.36 --> 7082.159
at late adolescent kids it has that

7080.0 --> 7086.599
spirit it is about characters that are

7082.159 --> 7086.598999999999
that and it's really all out

7086.639 --> 7088.88
right

7089.36 --> 7092.88
so you got to realize if you're gonna

7091.199 --> 7095.919999999999
like a girl watching it you're almost

7092.88 --> 7097.599
gonna be like the date of the guy that's

7095.92 --> 7100.56
watching and that's why i'm saying like

7097.599 --> 7102.719
you gotta gotta watch it with a man

7100.56 --> 7106.4800000000005
i'm not even trying to be sexist it's

7102.719 --> 7106.4800000000005
just i think it it would be better

7107.28 --> 7114.159
but again if you're like oh i'm so into

7110.48 --> 7116.08
anime and i'm already like screwed over

7114.159 --> 7119.5199999999995
by the insanity of this world yeah then

7116.08 --> 7119.5199999999995
you could probably watch it and

7120.239 --> 7125.919999999999
it wouldn't even be that impressive

7123.52 --> 7128.159000000001
but you're not gonna get it though then

7125.92 --> 7131.119
because there's so much subtleties like

7128.159 --> 7132.48
that level of subtlety doesn't exist

7131.119 --> 7138.598999999999
anymore

7132.48 --> 7138.598999999999
nobody's done it like that again you see

7142.239 --> 7144.48
so

7145.199 --> 7148.799999999999
but i'll leave it to you susie s

7150.8 --> 7157.8
just realize it's kind of a man's movie

7154.159 --> 7157.799999999999
young man's movie

7164.88 --> 7169.1990000000005
they say 2030 mobile phone will be in

7167.52 --> 7171.84
you go [ __ ] them

7169.199 --> 7171.839999999999
never

7179.52 --> 7183.280000000001
dude

7181.28 --> 7184.4
i mean oh mobile phone will be you yeah

7183.28 --> 7188.4
until

7184.4 --> 7191.119
until all the radio towers get blown up

7188.4 --> 7193.44
then there's no more phone in you

7191.119 --> 7195.199
nothing

7193.44 --> 7196.638999999999
there's going to be an age where we will

7195.199 --> 7199.44
reject

7196.639 --> 7203.119
mobile communication systems

7199.44 --> 7204.719
societally it's gonna happen

7203.119 --> 7207.28
it has to happen

7204.719 --> 7210.4
we don't we're all dead

7207.28 --> 7213.759999999999
because it will be the microwave that is

7210.4 --> 7216.239
gonna make us into the pots

7213.76 --> 7219.119000000001
i mean into the frogs boiling in a pot

7216.239 --> 7221.919999999999
it is what it is going to become there's

7219.119 --> 7224.4
no escaping that

7221.92 --> 7226.8
has to be a point at some point in the

7224.4 --> 7231.28
near future where man

7226.8 --> 7235.159000000001
kind will reject mobile phones

7231.28 --> 7235.159
purely out of principle

7244.239 --> 7247.239
skinny

7312.48 --> 7316.32
all right it comes well

7314.4 --> 7317.92
just think of it like this

7316.32 --> 7321.599
you've got it in your body that means

7317.92 --> 7323.76
you can never turn it off

7321.599 --> 7325.28
you're gonna always have it with you

7323.76 --> 7326.8
forever

7325.28 --> 7330.32
you're never gonna get out of the

7326.8 --> 7330.320000000001
microwave ever again

7337.199 --> 7342.32
i don't recommend it

7340.4 --> 7345.679
dude i don't even take my mobile phone

7342.32 --> 7345.679
with me when i go anywhere

7346.0 --> 7351.119
unless i specifically need it to get

7348.639 --> 7352.96
into contact

7351.119 --> 7356.44
and that's the only thing that i then

7352.96 --> 7356.44
use it for

7372.32 --> 7376.239
oh god

7373.92 --> 7379.639
kitty

7376.239 --> 7379.638999999999
are you okay

7389.199 --> 7393.199
kitty doesn't know what he wants and

7391.04 --> 7395.92
wants food probably but he's not going

7393.199 --> 7397.44
to get it you've already got one

7395.92 --> 7400.32
it's

7397.44 --> 7400.32
one of those days

7405.28 --> 7408.28
here

7414.08 --> 7417.48
it is

7438.96 --> 7444.159
yeah it's a neighbor kitty but

7441.92 --> 7448.32
he's adopted me

7444.159 --> 7450.96
he's always using like my room as like a

7448.32 --> 7452.32
an internal staircase because the window

7450.96 --> 7454.0
below is

7452.32 --> 7456.0
always open

7454.0 --> 7457.84
all during the summer anyway

7456.0 --> 7459.599
it just comes walking on the balcony and

7457.84 --> 7464.1990000000005
then it goes through the house out of my

7459.599 --> 7464.1990000000005
window back the balcony below

7464.4 --> 7467.598999999999
yeah silly

7470.159 --> 7474.4
right i think i'm gonna round out the

7472.159 --> 7474.4
show

7474.88 --> 7479.84
unless somebody had another

7477.44 --> 7482.159
point they would like to bring up

7479.84 --> 7484.159000000001
quickly

7482.159 --> 7487.598999999999
because it's been over two hours and i

7484.159 --> 7487.598999999999
kind of want to get some lunch

7490.239 --> 7493.239
hmm

7500.8 --> 7504.88
oh wow really

7502.8 --> 7506.96
that's impressive

7504.88 --> 7509.92
did you see that can still jump with

7506.96 --> 7509.92
only one back leg

7512.32 --> 7517.28
which radio frequencies are the most

7514.32 --> 7519.199
dangerous well the higher frequencies

7517.28 --> 7521.119
are always more dangerous it's always

7519.199 --> 7522.96
the higher frequency

7521.119 --> 7524.96
the worse

7522.96 --> 7526.32
but what is the most dangerous which is

7524.96 --> 7528.96
being utilized with these high

7526.32 --> 7531.759999999999
frequencies is a very specific type of

7528.96 --> 7535.679
oscillation

7531.76 --> 7538.159000000001
it's weird where they basically

7535.679 --> 7540.96
fractalize the very

7538.159 --> 7543.199
radio wave

7540.96 --> 7546.2390000000005
in some way and that has like an

7543.199 --> 7548.5599999999995
oscillating effect now it communicates a

7546.239 --> 7550.159
lot of data compacted in a less

7548.56 --> 7552.719
bandwidth

7550.159 --> 7554.0
but it's actually really terrible for

7552.719 --> 7558.079
life

7554.0 --> 7558.079
because it kind of like breaks you apart

7558.8 --> 7563.4400000000005
and really like that

7561.04 --> 7566.239
type of frequency which is the wi-fi

7563.44 --> 7568.239
typical used frequency

7566.239 --> 7569.759999999999
and g5

7568.239 --> 7574.239
5g

7569.76 --> 7576.96
and it breaks you apart like a microwave

7574.239 --> 7579.598999999999
like a microwave breaks apart water

7576.96 --> 7583.52
except the microwave tends to do it

7579.599 --> 7583.52
with just a lot of high energy

7584.8 --> 7589.04
right because

7586.239 --> 7592.718999999999
microwave will still use like

7589.04 --> 7594.96
many factors more energy for what it

7592.719 --> 7596.719
does than your mobile

7594.96 --> 7600.56
but the waves that are coming out of

7596.719 --> 7602.0
that mobile if you're using 5g

7600.56 --> 7604.719
is going to be

7602.0 --> 7606.4
even on the lower energy level

7604.719 --> 7608.88
very bad for you and it's going to

7606.4 --> 7611.679
compound over time

7608.88 --> 7614.400000000001
it's going to break you apart slowly

7611.679 --> 7614.4
it's not good

7615.679 --> 7619.92
and there's already been elaborate

7617.84 --> 7621.52
experience on this and how this works

7619.92 --> 7624.159
with wi-fi

7621.52 --> 7627.119000000001
because wi-fi already is standardized

7624.159 --> 7630.48
it's already there like 20 years

7627.119 --> 7632.5599999999995
and it is effectively like 5g

7630.48 --> 7635.119
and people use it in their homes and

7632.56 --> 7637.92
then they like sit right next to the

7635.119 --> 7640.639
wi-fi generator and they work there all

7637.92 --> 7643.04
day and then after a few years they get

7640.639 --> 7644.84
like this weird nervous disorder or

7643.04 --> 7647.599
cancer

7644.84 --> 7649.76
yeah because they're constantly bathing

7647.599 --> 7653.28
in that crap because they don't think it

7649.76 --> 7653.280000000001
does invisible move

7658.72 --> 7661.909000000001
[Music]

7677.52 --> 7682.079000000001
safest type of frequency modula i don't

7680.0 --> 7684.4
know the technical specs i just know

7682.079 --> 7684.4
that

7685.199 --> 7691.36
the lower the bandwidth the better

7688.88 --> 7693.36
for everything for everything right

7691.36 --> 7695.679
because then you need less transmitters

7693.36 --> 7697.598999999999
you can cover more distance

7695.679 --> 7701.1990000000005
the problem is is that they're all like

7697.599 --> 7702.400000000001
oh but we wanted oh we want to offer our

7701.199 --> 7705.04
public

7702.4 --> 7709.119
five gigabyte per second transfer

7705.04 --> 7710.48
wireless oh they need it so bad oh yes

7709.119 --> 7711.92
oh

7710.48 --> 7715.44
yeah no

7711.92 --> 7718.159
they don't you [ __ ] not

7715.44 --> 7722.0
stupid spoiled piece of [ __ ]

7718.159 --> 7724.48
nobody needs that nobody needs it stop

7722.0 --> 7728.239
being a spoiled piece of [ __ ] that wants

7724.48 --> 7730.959999999999
everything i wear it now with one click

7728.239 --> 7734.32
i want to download the iris movie on my

7730.96 --> 7734.32
mobile right now

7734.4 --> 7739.839999999999
yeah only [ __ ] retards that are gonna

7736.96 --> 7743.88
die of cancer want that

7739.84 --> 7743.88
nobody needs that

7758.079 --> 7761.119
yeah already the valve doesn't mean it's

7759.92 --> 7763.76
deployed

7761.119 --> 7766.96
it's deployed in china i think

7763.76 --> 7766.96
this is not gonna happen

7767.76 --> 7773.119000000001
[ __ ] their smart cities

7770.32 --> 7775.92
it was up to me i'd outlaw it

7773.119 --> 7780.4
entirely like outlaw

7775.92 --> 7780.4
you're not allowed to do that

7783.119 --> 7788.079
i think they're going to try out one

7784.639 --> 7789.4400000000005
smart city in my country appledorn so

7788.079 --> 7791.199
i've heard

7789.44 --> 7794.079
so they're gonna just [ __ ] it up it's

7791.199 --> 7797.28
gonna be radiation central well i always

7794.079 --> 7799.28
hated that city it's ugly as [ __ ]

7797.28 --> 7802.0
it's not a good feeling hanging there

7799.28 --> 7804.32
anyway so okay they're gonna fry it fine

7802.0 --> 7807.28
go and fry it as long as i don't have to

7804.32 --> 7810.159
live there i'm i'm fine with that

7807.28 --> 7811.92
not gonna pay for local people's cancer

7810.159 --> 7816.32
bills either

7811.92 --> 7818.56
it's all up to you find out how great it

7816.32 --> 7818.5599999999995
is

7826.84 --> 7831.679
okay isn't buffering when there's not

7829.28 --> 7834.32
enough bandwidth no

7831.679 --> 7834.32
no it's not

7835.199 --> 7841.759999999999
it's just data transfer issues

7838.32 --> 7844.159
bandwidth is never the issue

7841.76 --> 7847.360000000001
if there would be a bandwidth issue then

7844.159 --> 7850.079
you just lower down the resolution

7847.36 --> 7852.719
because you don't need that yeah

7850.079 --> 7857.04
voice transference

7852.719 --> 7858.719
is very little information yeah very

7857.04 --> 7861.04
little

7858.719 --> 7862.719
that's why telephones even with

7861.04 --> 7864.48
relatively clear

7862.719 --> 7867.28
sound quality

7864.48 --> 7868.718999999999
could work great like on

7867.28 --> 7871.44
3g

7868.719 --> 7873.599
and 2g fine why

7871.44 --> 7875.598999999999
because imagery

7873.599 --> 7880.32
the higher res you get

7875.599 --> 7882.84
imagery is like 10 000 times more data

7880.32 --> 7889.199
consuming

7882.84 --> 7889.1990000000005
right a lot more than sound a lot

7891.199 --> 7894.4
so

7892.159 --> 7897.679
if you've got issues

7894.4 --> 7898.638999999999
then just turn the resolution down

7897.679 --> 7901.04
right

7898.639 --> 7904.400000000001
unless you wanna live stream watch your

7901.04 --> 7906.159
movie no that's your problem then

7904.4 --> 7907.44
that's what you do with your time and

7906.159 --> 7910.159
your

7907.44 --> 7911.919999999999
radiation time then you do that i'm not

7910.159 --> 7915.199
doing that i'm not going to

7911.92 --> 7919.719
download wirelessly a movie

7915.199 --> 7919.719
can't think of a dumber thing to do

7926.239 --> 7934.959999999999
i'm not willing to give up anything

7930.48 --> 7937.759999999999
i don't need to i don't use wireless

7934.96 --> 7940.159
[ __ ] i got everything wired when it's

7937.76 --> 7941.52
wired you effectively have infinite

7940.159 --> 7944.719
speed

7941.52 --> 7946.96
effectively infinite

7944.719 --> 7951.52
you're always going to be cut down in

7946.96 --> 7953.44
the speed because of outside roots

7951.52 --> 7956.8
that you're going to have to take anyway

7953.44 --> 7960.96
including when you do it wireless

7956.8 --> 7962.639
oh everything is instant no it's not

7960.96 --> 7964.2390000000005
you're still gonna have to go through

7962.639 --> 7969.1990000000005
the same channels that are gonna have a

7964.239 --> 7971.04
slowdown while you're getting fried huh

7969.199 --> 7974.32
yeah it doesn't work

7971.04 --> 7977.5199999999995
nothing about it works it's only

7974.32 --> 7979.759999999999
dumb [ __ ] for lazy people

7977.52 --> 7979.76
and

7980.84 --> 7985.679
yuppies spoiled rich idiots

7993.119 --> 7997.44
that's right george sanford now dude

7995.679 --> 8000.4800000000005
fiber optics

7997.44 --> 8002.879999999999
they haven't even started

8000.48 --> 8004.839999999999
to really develop that dude we could

8002.88 --> 8008.84
have

8004.84 --> 8012.079
unbelievably fast internet that's like

8008.84 --> 8014.079
instantaneously through fiber optics you

8012.079 --> 8016.32
if you just enhance it enhance it put it

8014.079 --> 8018.32
everywhere you could have like a hundred

8016.32 --> 8019.84
gigabyte transfer

8018.32 --> 8022.0
in a second

8019.84 --> 8022.88
without a flinch

8022.0 --> 8024.8
yeah

8022.88 --> 8027.84
can you imagine that that's what you

8024.8 --> 8030.719
could reach with like properly developed

8027.84 --> 8030.719
fiber optics

8032.639 --> 8039.0
we haven't even started to industrially

8034.96 --> 8039.0
develop that okay

8040.96 --> 8048.199
because everybody's into wireless now

8044.48 --> 8048.199
stupid [ __ ]

8056.079 --> 8059.5199999999995
one terabyte jesus

8060.719 --> 8065.599
okay so

8062.639 --> 8067.84
i guess i called it then george

8065.599 --> 8071.76
i just know it's going to be it like

8067.84 --> 8073.92
almost instantaneous compared to useless

8071.76 --> 8076.4800000000005
wi-fi [ __ ]

8073.92 --> 8078.159
wireless transfer yeah it can be very

8076.48 --> 8081.759999999999
handy

8078.159 --> 8083.91
should always be minimized always about

8081.76 --> 8085.1990000000005
minimum transfer

8083.91 --> 8087.599
[Music]

8085.199 --> 8088.879999999999
that's what you should use wireless for

minimum

8088.88 --> 8096.079
essential transfer of information

8092.719 --> 8098.639
that's it that should be its permanent

8096.079 --> 8103.88
technological designation

8098.639 --> 8103.88
the rest cable should be standardized

8122.639 --> 8126.2390000000005

8124.4 --> 8129.119
wi-fi versus

8126.239 --> 8129.119
