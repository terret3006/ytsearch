Arwen and before we start the show

55.46 --> 66.289
please don't forget to share it on any

57.32 --> 70.399
platform you deem fit and and if you

66.289 --> 72.619

know when I'm going live which normally

74.479 --> 81.289
is 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time but today

77.63 --> 83.21
it's 1:00 p.m. amps at i'm time because

81.289 --> 86.899
I thought I'm gonna start early to make

83.21 --> 94.52
up for yesterday and I've been up very

86.899 --> 98.56
early so yeah also please support my

94.52 --> 101.509
show through the super chat sometimes

98.56 --> 104.68900000000001
PayPal preferably and you can also

101.509 --> 108.259
support the long-term projects all you

104.689 --> 113.19999999999999
can find of it is in the description box

108.259 --> 119.18
below GoFundMe paid reom all that so

113.2 --> 121.369
today is a awesome day there's only one

119.18 --> 124.21900000000001
downside to it and that is that they

121.369 --> 128.81
completely come chill the [ __ ] out of

124.219 --> 134.17
the place but other than that not a lot

128.81 --> 134.17000000000002
of natural clouds and it's warm

135.459 --> 140.29
I've just been in my t-shirt all day ah

140.56 --> 147.31900000000002
even hot in here but yeah then again an

144.92 --> 156.379
hour before the store the show starts it

147.319 --> 159.95
is so today I got with me tea of course

156.379 --> 162.54899999999998
and some Tamera coffee and I tried

159.95 --> 167.11999999999998
exactly what I said I was going to try

162.549 --> 168.56
with the mixture on top this time and it

167.12 --> 171.56
worked really well

168.56 --> 176.54
it went through quickly this way and

171.56 --> 179.9
it's good I significantly toned down the

176.54 --> 184.22
amount of turmeric powder turmeric

179.9 --> 193.64000000000001
pepper combination and it's I already

184.22 --> 197.45
got one taste and it's so good wow it's

193.64 --> 202.7
still just a little little little a

197.45 --> 206.61999999999998
little spicy in the far distance but

202.7 --> 211.11999999999998
yeah it's not really this this is

206.62 --> 213.709
perfect this is absolutely perfect and

211.12 --> 216.859
I'm gonna do a long time with that

213.709 --> 222.169
because just little spoons I think it

216.859 --> 225.549
could do I spent like 10 euros on that

222.169 --> 228.89000000000001
extra powder and that's gonna last me

225.549 --> 232.06
probably two three months

228.89 --> 232.05999999999997
[Music]

232.27 --> 238.93
if I don't start chugging coffee like a

235.22 --> 242.0
maniac and no longer have sleeping time

238.93 --> 245.0
but I don't plan to even though now

242.0 --> 254.06
apparently I could well probably not for

245.0 --> 256.94
long mmm what yeah good stuff so let's

254.06 --> 263.69
see who arrived early in chat also see

256.94 --> 265.1
Steve HM chemical I don't musk right

263.69 --> 272.65
beta Van Leeuwen

265.1 --> 272.65000000000003
oh and yep yeah good morning guys

276.01 --> 283.65999999999997
so yeah in contrast yesterday I don't

280.16 --> 283.66
have a lot of specifics to talk about

283.96 --> 291.38
it's Thursday today yeah well yeah I do

287.27 --> 294.5
but it kind of sucks it's issues now I

291.38 --> 297.919
have with my with my social welfare that

294.5 --> 300.5
for some reason despite me basically

297.919 --> 306.56
reporting my income from Google and

300.5 --> 311.78
everything honestly it was a little late

306.56 --> 315.86
but yeah still going with it like as I'm

311.78 --> 318.77
supposed to and they basically decided

315.86 --> 321.5
to take a chunk out of my welfare now

318.77 --> 325.31
that is actually bigger than everything

321.5 --> 328.01
I made together from Google so I wonder

325.31 --> 330.169
what the hell is up with that that's

328.01 --> 332.33
just brutal

330.169 --> 337.31
that doesn't make any sense to me that's

332.33 --> 339.01
just pure punishment and I'm definitely

337.31 --> 341.21
gonna demand an explanation for this and

339.01 --> 345.5
I'm gonna need some help

341.21 --> 347.63
because I'm pretty like a little scared

345.5 --> 349.7
in a way because I wonder like what is

347.63 --> 351.68
this is this like a mistake or are they

349.7 --> 354.68
literally now punishing me for being

351.68 --> 356.72
late or whatever or have they caught on

354.68 --> 358.34000000000003
to my show and they don't like it and

356.72 --> 360.59000000000003
they see it as a detriment so they're

358.34 --> 362.79999999999995
just gonna go for punishment now I don't

360.59 --> 365.77
know I haven't even received a letter

362.8 --> 368.86
about it I just noticed that not that

365.77 --> 374.159
much money came back on my account it's

368.86 --> 374.159
a total total bummer

376.289 --> 381.419
so yeah in that sense I can't really

379.15 --> 384.87
kind of use your support right now and

381.419 --> 389.10999999999996
don't do it through super chat I guess

384.87 --> 391.449
if this keeps up that's yeah like if

389.11 --> 395.28000000000003
this persists I'm gonna do monetize the

391.449 --> 400.27000000000004
channel because it's it's now yous just

395.28 --> 403.94899999999996
gonna get punished for it I don't know

400.27 --> 403.94899999999996
what it is I really don't know

409.229 --> 417.06899999999996
so we'll see I'm just gonna enjoy the

413.169 --> 420.27
day despite all that and I'm thinking

417.069 --> 423.699
about copper tools all the time and I

420.27 --> 427.09
like kind of I kind of like that copper

423.699 --> 432.639
is involved with this because copper

427.09 --> 435.60999999999996
falls into the reach of my craft like

432.639 --> 438.61
steel not so much it's a whole different

435.61 --> 441.039
type of discipline it's not really my

438.61 --> 445.0
specialty I have done some things with

441.039 --> 448.33
it but my specialty is is basically

445.0 --> 451.36
goldsmithing and under goldsmithing also

448.33 --> 454.35999999999996
falls of course silver but copper copper

451.36 --> 457.599
is actually a regular material in the

454.36 --> 461.05
use of gold smithing and there's really

457.599 --> 463.479
no problem getting it and yeah you learn

461.05 --> 468.639
to work with it like we Goldsmith's

463.479 --> 473.36
learned to practice on copper and alloys

468.639 --> 477.23900000000003
with copper and other stuff so

473.36 --> 478.73900000000003
yeah it shouldn't be too hard I could

477.239 --> 482.12899999999996
probably make a lot of things out of

478.739 --> 485.399
copper and even we have how its applied

482.129 --> 489.659
in plumbing yeah you do it yourself

485.399 --> 493.8
stores have copper pipes and stuff you

489.659 --> 497.569
can order plates roof you know there's

493.8 --> 503.279
all kinds of things you could do now get

497.569 --> 505.709
yeah or even just order if I don't know

503.279 --> 507.719
how hard it will be it all depends on

505.709 --> 511.499
what you're gonna make of course complex

507.719 --> 514.409
oh really crab well crafted it has to be

511.499 --> 518.159
or a desk it almost be like a machine

514.409 --> 521.519
product very precise yeah that's much

518.159 --> 522.87
harder to do as a goldsmith but if

521.519 --> 528.329
you're gonna make an art piece out of it

522.87 --> 530.759
then it's perfect so yeah just thinking

528.329 --> 532.16
about potential things I could do in the

530.759 --> 539.819
future

532.16 --> 543.12
you know options for the long run and

539.819 --> 545.189
also thinking like how many farmers like

543.12 --> 547.92
even industrial farmers even know about

545.189 --> 550.259
this I'll bet you a lot of organic

547.92 --> 555.209
farmers probably or at least some of

550.259 --> 560.49
them or have some hint of it maybe none

555.209 --> 562.3499999999999
of them embrace it but who knows and

560.49 --> 564.42
maybe some industrial like big

562.35 --> 568.0400000000001
industrials may catch on to it and

564.42 --> 573.56
really apply the [ __ ] out of it because

568.04 --> 576.389
like they're sort of borderline reckless

573.56 --> 578.5189999999999
behavior with the soil on average you

576.389 --> 581.37
like really over industrializing it will

578.519 --> 586.139
absolutely require them to do that in

581.37 --> 589.939
order to restore it a little so hey if

586.139 --> 589.939
it yields result it yields result

590.06 --> 599.93
and copper is around plenty is one of

594.38 --> 602.12
the the least rare metals around it's

599.93 --> 606.3399999999999
like oh it's almost like God intended

602.12 --> 610.69
that to be to everything to be abundant

606.34 --> 619.1600000000001
mmm copper everywhere mm-hmm

610.69 --> 621.08
you know copper pins in the soles of

619.16 --> 623.4399999999999
your shoes that's a good one I heard

621.08 --> 623.44
that before

624.22 --> 636.87
yeah or brass the brass is mostly copper

628.09 --> 639.85
as well and like before the modern age

636.87 --> 641.91
brass was widely used for all kinds of

639.85 --> 641.91
things

645.279 --> 650.529
maybe that kind of came out of as a

647.769 --> 654.009
habit out of the tartarean age with all

650.529 --> 656.98
the atmospheric electricity stuff that I

654.009 --> 661.269
was already present and it's just yeah

656.98 --> 663.16
why not why wouldn't that be normal it

661.269 --> 664.9590000000001
would be normal and people might not

663.16 --> 667.779
even be conscious about it anymore

664.959 --> 670.029
because like that was introduced several

667.779 --> 672.22
generations ago and the youngsters are

670.029 --> 674.079
just we are wandering of a completely

672.22 --> 682.839
lost track of how that actually came

674.079 --> 685.8599999999999
into being so yeah right

682.839 --> 685.86
razzes copper and zinc

692.54 --> 696.759
yeah

693.61 --> 696.759
[Music]

710.08 --> 714.1600000000001
alright so ya guys

717.72 --> 722.6
what

719.48 --> 727.61
Wow Rick Dawkins well what is your Jesus

722.6 --> 732.47
what is your look I agree that PayPal

727.61 --> 735.23
has been very like politically involving

732.47 --> 736.9100000000001
itself which is just terrible and it's

735.23 --> 737.71
not the only company that's doing that

736.91 --> 742.31
okay

737.71 --> 746.38
obviously but as a system I really see

742.31 --> 749.2099999999999
no problem with it they only even charge

746.38 --> 753.5
anything when you start to move huge

749.21 --> 755.98
quantities of money so I don't see the

753.5 --> 755.98
issue here

759.91 --> 763.6899999999999
well yeah maybe the leadership should

761.89 --> 767.71
definitely get a slap to the face I

763.69 --> 769.6
guess sorry Pay Pal well probably even

767.71 --> 775.69
people secretly in the company would

769.6 --> 777.73
agree to that but yeah as a functioning

775.69 --> 779.4100000000001
company other than the Annoying

777.73 --> 783.4300000000001
political influences now

779.41 --> 787.35
the censorship conspiracy other than

783.43 --> 787.3499999999999
that I think there's no problem with it

788.34 --> 796.4290000000001
[Music]

803.0 --> 811.759
oh yeah brexit stuff yeah I've been

806.36 --> 819.5
reading up on that following him Alex

811.759 --> 822.7090000000001
Jones Show and RT and YouTube kind of

819.5 --> 827.889
forwarded me towards several of those

822.709 --> 827.8889999999999
videos as well it was interesting

843.47 --> 846.34
hmm

849.62 --> 855.55
ah sorry yeah I'm getting distracted

858.61 --> 861.61
right

877.88 --> 883.95
right yeah

879.9 --> 888.6899999999999
I agree yeah when something is actually

883.95 --> 891.1700000000001
a utility it should not be allowed to be

888.69 --> 891.1700000000001
politicized

892.07 --> 897.87
but that whole precedent of basically

895.31 --> 901.6199999999999
enabling any kind of behavior for

897.87 --> 904.17
political reasons that are normally not

901.62 --> 906.66
allowed that is the the real precedent

904.17 --> 911.0889999999999
that's actually disrupting everything

906.66 --> 911.0889999999999
and causing all these shockwaves because

912.92 --> 918.9499999999999
yeah that example basically lures people

916.41 --> 923.43
out to go with that as a kind of a

918.95 --> 926.46
twisted virtue signal that's what that

923.43 --> 928.62
that's what's really causing it that

926.46 --> 930.0600000000001
that's being allowed that precedent so

928.62 --> 932.93
that should be stopped

930.06 --> 943.9499999999999
should be like no you can't do that

932.93 --> 946.3199999999999
abruptly and yet to be fair I had there

943.95 --> 948.2090000000001
were originally like ideas that Trump

946.32 --> 950.19
was gonna do so much about it and he

948.209 --> 952.89
says like hooey is gonna do about it but

950.19 --> 955.5290000000001
yeah are we really noticing any of that

952.89 --> 959.01
are they toning it down are people being

955.529 --> 966.52
led back on to the platform now no I'm

959.01 --> 969.16
not seeing any of that so yeah

966.52 --> 973.14
it seems like we're gonna be stuck with

969.16 --> 975.6999999999999
these kind of corporatists for a while

973.14 --> 983.59
we're gonna somehow have to deal with

975.7 --> 985.51
that it's really annoying but yeah I

983.59 --> 987.7800000000001
think we'll all work around it and

985.51 --> 990.52
besides there's the cryptocurrency

987.78 --> 994.63
revolution pretty much going on that's

990.52 --> 1000.27
gonna change a lot of things on the long

994.63 --> 1004.9399999999999
run so everything is kind of in flux

1000.27 --> 1004.9399999999999
right now in a transition phase

1011.96 --> 1016.82
and to be fair I think everything's

1014.72 --> 1020.899
going to be pretty damn glorious after

1016.82 --> 1023.63
it and the only thing that could really

1020.899 --> 1027.26
ruin it is just the nasty people

1023.63 --> 1029.36
actively wanting to ruin it if they're

1027.26 --> 1036.02
gonna do that when things like really

1029.36 --> 1038.569
hit off that's when yeah that's when the

1036.02 --> 1040.339
flourishing broken free governments are

1038.569 --> 1048.47
going to be absolutely sick of it and

1040.339 --> 1050.72
just stop him like Gowanus a more

1048.47 --> 1056.33
serious offense a counter political

1050.72 --> 1060.58
offense in whatever form and of course

1056.33 --> 1060.58
will be yeah it's gonna be complicated

1064.52 --> 1068.69
but yeah these these Marxists what

1067.19 --> 1073.309
that's technically what that's why I

1068.69 --> 1074.0900000000001
called them that it's just they don't go

1073.309 --> 1080.3
away

1074.09 --> 1081.9499999999998
they don't stop it they never they never

1080.3 --> 1085.3899999999999
realized they'd never allow themselves

1081.95 --> 1087.98
to realize that it is insane to do this

1085.39 --> 1092.9
that their plan is literally destroying

1087.98 --> 1097.22
everything and they just cognitive

1092.9 --> 1102.46
dissonance the [ __ ] out of that and they

1097.22 --> 1102.46
try to justify it it's it becomes insane

1109.54 --> 1121.97
and maybe it's the heat I feel like I'm

1112.31 --> 1125.9199999999998
almost like losing track there are

1121.97 --> 1125.92
Buddhists walking outside

1130.41 --> 1136.89
I'm not joking like they're walking

1132.63 --> 1140.3700000000001
they're in great they're about to walk

1136.89 --> 1142.8300000000002
in the Sun yeah they come walking by

1140.37 --> 1145.02
here for some reason now I understand

1142.83 --> 1148.32
because this route that they do walk is

1145.02 --> 1152.27
kind of beautiful especially now it's

1148.32 --> 1158.24
just funny that they always walk past my

1152.27 --> 1161.7
my view here when the do go on walks

1158.24 --> 1166.799
well there is like a Buddhist temple not

1161.7 --> 1171.929
too far away from here it's like half a

1166.799 --> 1174.24
kilometer that way I bike I on my

1171.929 --> 1176.52
bicycle I get go past it pretty much

1174.24 --> 1179.58
every day on the way to the supermarket

1176.52 --> 1181.26
so it's just still interesting I'd been

1179.58 --> 1183.98
there one time when I had like a very

1181.26 --> 1188.22
serious

1183.98 --> 1190.1100000000001
weird breakdown like I that was like in

1188.22 --> 1194.429
the middle when I was very seriously

1190.11 --> 1198.299
plagued by my visions it was so surreal

1194.429 --> 1200.25
just the memory of that how basically I

1198.299 --> 1202.62
experienced things that I had literally

1200.25 --> 1204.69
seen so many times before that's when

1202.62 --> 1209.549
like the real hallucination type

1204.69 --> 1211.679
realization things come out and in

1209.549 --> 1217.77
extreme emotional states that's what it

1211.679 --> 1219.5300000000002
seems to happen those kind of things but

1217.77 --> 1224.51
I haven't had that for a while thank God

1219.53 --> 1224.51
something I'm very stable for my doing

1226.75 --> 1237.88
yeah what yeah funny

1233.95 --> 1237.88
Buddhists they're nice people

1242.44 --> 1249.52
they're Chinese though I don't even know

1245.92 --> 1252.3300000000002
if these two that came walking past if

1249.52 --> 1263.77
they can even normally speak Dutch

1252.33 --> 1269.31
probably not but then again maybe they

1263.77 --> 1269.31
do you never really know for sure

1287.2 --> 1290.2
anyway

1292.96 --> 1299.6200000000001
see my god my normal show hasn't even

1296.59 --> 1301.06
started yet and I'm already now I'm not

1299.62 --> 1304.3799999999999
out of gas I'm just a little flustered

1301.06 --> 1308.53
from the from the heat and expected that

1304.38 --> 1311.5
and the coffee does hit good but I guess

1308.53 --> 1314.8899999999999
with the heat it doesn't have the same

1311.5 --> 1316.6
effect or it's like it's better to be

1314.89 --> 1320.4
cool in the shadow when you drink coffee

1316.6 --> 1328.2099999999998
I guess I'm doing fine

1320.4 --> 1335.68
see that's get into what's been

1328.21 --> 1339.33
happening on YouTube a pretty late night

1335.68 --> 1343.72
actually yesterday I watched a movie I

1339.33 --> 1345.82
was going through Netflix again oh yeah

1343.72 --> 1349.0
I had some Paul Joseph Watson videos

1345.82 --> 1352.3
again why do they always look like this

1349.0 --> 1360.55
Oh God

1352.3 --> 1362.71
I don't know how he does it like I find

1360.55 --> 1365.94
him so freaking hilarious and to the

1362.71 --> 1369.01
point and but it is kind of juvenile

1365.94 --> 1374.02
like Paul Joseph Watson is almost like

1369.01 --> 1376.99
that cheeky school reporter that is just

1374.02 --> 1379.9
freakin hilarious and hits the note

1376.99 --> 1381.73
every time that's just how he feels and

1379.9 --> 1386.17
that's probably why there's a lot of

1381.73 --> 1388.08
young people that like him I think he's

1386.17 --> 1392.5600000000002
funny

1388.08 --> 1395.4299999999998
ioann Benjamin had another stream I was

1392.56 --> 1395.4299999999998
talking on it

1401.94 --> 1411.53
yeah the Flat Earth debates I was there

1405.98 --> 1411.53
was okay I was lunching most out of time

1414.2 --> 1418.92
see now that's it

1416.94 --> 1434.3
yeah okay I'll report on what I've been

1418.92 --> 1434.3000000000002
what what did I watch i watch the movie

1434.96 --> 1444.24
how do you check what you did watch

1438.99 --> 1448.65
oh yeah God now I remember that it was

1444.24 --> 1451.92
like that one of the late the the the

1448.65 --> 1457.74
Newark King Kong movie like Kong or

1451.92 --> 1459.48
whatever and God oh it it was a very I

1457.74 --> 1463.02
got a lot of mixed feelings about that

1459.48 --> 1467.19
movie I can tell you that it was

1463.02 --> 1478.2
extremely annoying but also fascinating

1467.19 --> 1481.2
and yeah the CGI was just like from okay

1478.2 --> 1483.63
to like absolutely stunning and like how

1481.2 --> 1486.69
they applied it and didn't like there

1483.63 --> 1489.6000000000001
were some really it was so extensive

1486.69 --> 1491.97
there were so many yeah you think like

1489.6 --> 1493.4699999999998
Oh King Kong oh it's like oh like all

1491.97 --> 1496.3500000000001
the other movies where it's just like

1493.47 --> 1498.8700000000001
okay jungle whatever people who culture

1496.35 --> 1500.6699999999998
surrounding a giant ape oh and then the

1498.87 --> 1504.51
Giant and the lady in the jail ape you

1500.67 --> 1506.7
know that that trope well this movie is

1504.51 --> 1513.45
like yeah you're waiting for that giant

1506.7 --> 1515.5800000000002
ape and then you see a giant zoo of it's

1513.45 --> 1517.8300000000002
basically Jurassic Park but not with

1515.58 --> 1522.9299999999998
Dinosaurs but with ancient giant

1517.83 --> 1527.3999999999999
creatures freakin amazing like holy [ __ ]

1522.93 --> 1531.0
that was really awesome about it like it

1527.4 --> 1532.25
was an almost D&D world with just giant

1531.0 --> 1534.56
crib

1532.25 --> 1538.16
they had giant cows and they were so

1534.56 --> 1543.76
cute and I mean giant freaking cows as

1538.16 --> 1547.3700000000001
big as well as this side of the building

1543.76 --> 1549.29
like with huge horns but they were

1547.37 --> 1551.87
pretty bloated looking and they were

1549.29 --> 1554.99
extremely Gentile but yeah they scared

1551.87 --> 1557.33
the [ __ ] out of the humans when they

1554.99 --> 1562.4
went it just popped up out of nowhere

1557.33 --> 1564.1699999999998
right in front of them that was

1562.4 --> 1571.64
fascinating but he had the whole story

1564.17 --> 1577.28
part and it was just oh god I thought it

1571.64 --> 1585.38
was like an embarrassment like you know

1577.28 --> 1588.59
it's it's weird because it really did

1585.38 --> 1590.8100000000002
now this gets like really more political

1588.59 --> 1593.4099999999999
and entangled and that's weird stuff but

1590.81 --> 1596.3899999999999
it was yeah I was very politicized and

1593.41 --> 1599.75
it made the military look really bad

1596.39 --> 1601.64
because one of the main that the main

1599.75 --> 1606.74
character the sergeant or whatever

1601.64 --> 1611.3300000000002
leaving like an operation to unknown he

1606.74 --> 1613.3
just went megalomaniacal and started

1611.33 --> 1616.8799999999999
like a revenge thing against this eighth

1613.3 --> 1618.77
because they just attacked it for no

1616.88 --> 1620.42
damn reason when it first popped up and

1618.77 --> 1622.22
then thought it was a good idea to keep

1620.42 --> 1624.26
hanging around it so it literally

1622.22 --> 1627.29
destroyed every single freaking

1624.26 --> 1630.64
helicopter it was so moronic like okay a

1627.29 --> 1632.0
giant thing pops up it smashes something

1630.64 --> 1635.18
scatter

1632.0 --> 1638.65
I was literally yelling it at the screen

1635.18 --> 1642.38
like what the [ __ ] are you morons doing

1638.65 --> 1644.1200000000001
scatter the [ __ ] out of there no they're

1642.38 --> 1648.5300000000002
just hanging around his head like oh

1644.12 --> 1650.2399999999998
yeah this was absolutely [ __ ] and

1648.53 --> 1652.22
that kind of that happened pretty early

1650.24 --> 1656.75
on that kind of ruined the movie for me

1652.22 --> 1658.6100000000001
like I hate it that was so [ __ ] how

1656.75 --> 1661.15
the military know that that didn't make

1658.61 --> 1661.1499999999999
any damn sense

1661.33 --> 1669.83
that part was very annoying although I

1666.74 --> 1672.83
it was samuel l.jackson that was that

1669.83 --> 1674.51
guy and he was kind of good at it he was

1672.83 --> 1677.54
really into he really had like the

1674.51 --> 1681.08
megalomaniacal look also it was he was a

1677.54 --> 1683.93
good evil sergeant

1681.08 --> 1687.11
kind of person character that was kind

1683.93 --> 1689.0900000000001
of funny it was but so mixed feeling

1687.11 --> 1693.86
white mixed feelings about that movie

1689.09 --> 1696.11
come but I don't know the CGI was just

1693.86 --> 1698.9799999999998
awesome and the creatures they created

1696.11 --> 1703.54
and like how they hunted in that terrain

1698.98 --> 1708.73
that was just like you know

1703.54 --> 1712.37
environmental biologists and people were

1708.73 --> 1715.88
were asked for advice and basically like

1712.37 --> 1717.9199999999998
in visualized an entire ecosystem they

1715.88 --> 1722.15
really freaking thought about it and you

1717.92 --> 1724.3100000000002
can it it shows the whole movie shows

1722.15 --> 1727.01
except for the people part the people

1724.31 --> 1729.29
are pretty much [ __ ] but the

1727.01 --> 1732.02
creatures and how they what they do and

1729.29 --> 1734.18
even their stances and everything they

1732.02 --> 1736.19
really hit on something they really made

1734.18 --> 1738.2
something with that and with the CGI so

1736.19 --> 1740.81
that part is definitely worth it so take

1738.2 --> 1744.26
a look at it it's on Netflix it might

1740.81 --> 1749.78
find it somewhere else as well so yeah

1744.26 --> 1751.58
that that was good I guess annoying and

1749.78 --> 1758.83
good at the same time mixed feelings

1751.58 --> 1758.83
again and yeah that was it

1759.02 --> 1763.299
it was two hours by the way the movie

1770.78 --> 1775.71
promoting Hollywood no I'm also giving

1773.25 --> 1778.94
legitimate criticism on them as well

1775.71 --> 1781.71
hey give credit where credit is due and

1778.94 --> 1784.71
give criticism where criticism is due

1781.71 --> 1786.66
and I just did that I just said this is

1784.71 --> 1792.48
what's ridiculous is absolute

1786.66 --> 1795.24
embarrassment for military-like I don't

1792.48 --> 1803.3700000000001
get why they even allowed that that kind

1795.24 --> 1807.06
of story and then again it was kind of

1803.37 --> 1808.5
it that was kind of bit off about it was

1807.06 --> 1812.8799999999999
in the Vietnam era

1808.5 --> 1817.31
it wasn't modern era so maybe that's why

1812.88 --> 1817.3100000000002
they allowed it to be like that and

1818.15 --> 1823.92
maybe it makes a little bit more sense

1820.92 --> 1827.73
but still like instinctual think of it

1823.92 --> 1829.1100000000001
you're you're with a unit of helicopters

1827.73 --> 1831.21
you're pretty confident you're strong

1829.11 --> 1834.51
and you can take on a lot of things and

1831.21 --> 1838.68
then suddenly a giant creature like

1834.51 --> 1840.51
really towering giant as yeah as big as

1838.68 --> 1842.43
a mountain did things are really

1840.51 --> 1844.29
freaking huge in this movie and that's

1842.43 --> 1846.54
fair and they did it very well

1844.29 --> 1849.42
all the CGI at that part is pretty

1846.54 --> 1852.87
impressive and the scale and you get the

1849.42 --> 1854.6100000000001
feel for the scale really well but yeah

1852.87 --> 1856.62
as soon as something like that pops up

1854.61 --> 1859.3799999999999
and it like over towers even your

1856.62 --> 1862.6799999999998
position in the helicopter instinct is

1859.38 --> 1864.8400000000001
just like no you don't hang around still

1862.68 --> 1866.8200000000002
or fly in circles around it to get it

1864.84 --> 1869.61
better look no you scatter the [ __ ] out

1866.82 --> 1873.1699999999998
of there so it doesn't make any damn

1869.61 --> 1879.6
sense even for a bunch of supposedly

1873.17 --> 1881.97
dumb roughneck military guys from the

1879.6 --> 1885.36
Vietnam era that's why it was

1881.97 --> 1888.3
off-putting to me it was just not an

1885.36 --> 1889.6799999999998
honest portrayal it wasn't natural and

1888.3 --> 1891.45
they could have done that they could

1889.68 --> 1894.3500000000001
have made a story that made a little bit

1891.45 --> 1894.3500000000001
more sense to it

1894.8 --> 1900.98
I could even conceptualize a story like

1899.33 --> 1902.99
on the spot like what I could have done

1900.98 --> 1905.51
is like I encountered it they scattered

1902.99 --> 1908.6
the [ __ ] out of there and then they set

1905.51 --> 1910.09
up camp they like try to check it out

1908.6 --> 1913.37
and the creature starts basically

1910.09 --> 1915.5
crushing them because it is really

1913.37 --> 1917.87
dominant and they are still kind of

1915.5 --> 1920.02
trigger-happy idiots and scared and

1917.87 --> 1926.1799999999998
accidentally pulling triggers and [ __ ]

1920.02 --> 1928.79
so and then yeah then kind of a revenge

1926.18 --> 1931.19
from a neutral non attacking standpoint

1928.79 --> 1933.71
would make a little bit more sense for

1931.19 --> 1936.95
the sergeant but then it could be like

1933.71 --> 1939.53
an aide in a [ __ ] story or what is it the

1936.95 --> 1941.51
white whale that thing that he's gonna

1939.53 --> 1943.16
gonna get obsessed with it and then

1941.51 --> 1944.84
everybody figures out like this makes no

1943.16 --> 1947.72
sense we can't take it on we have to

1944.84 --> 1951.7099999999998
stop it to be fair that would have been

1947.72 --> 1957.32
much more interesting to me and it

1951.71 --> 1962.39
wouldn't be so embarrassing so but yeah

1957.32 --> 1965.06
they chose this I guess it did give them

1962.39 --> 1968.2700000000002
a lot more opportunity to just CGI a

1965.06 --> 1971.84
giant ape taking out helicopters in very

1968.27 --> 1974.72
awesome ways like that creature had

1971.84 --> 1978.7099999999998
perfect coordination could just throw a

1974.72 --> 1981.53
tree like over half a mile away as a

1978.71 --> 1984.13
spear just strip it and throw it as a

1981.53 --> 1987.56
spear just right through a helicopter

1984.13 --> 1990.7700000000002
that was flying so it was like a master

1987.56 --> 1993.6799999999998
at aiming yeah the people considered

1990.77 --> 1995.0
that Kong to be like a God for not for

1993.68 --> 1998.03
good for a good reason because it was

1995.0 --> 2001.84
around for ages as long as they could

1998.03 --> 2005.35
remember so it's a pretty interesting

2001.84 --> 2010.81
story at that sorry for rambling on

2005.35 --> 2013.56
about that part just yeah the creature

2010.81 --> 2017.52
scape was very interesting in the movie

2013.56 --> 2020.95
definitely recommended to watch that

2017.52 --> 2023.31
anyway yeah hey hello Nathan Oakley good

2020.95 --> 2023.31
morning

2025.309 --> 2037.309
if anyone wants to come on by the way

2028.88 --> 2037.3090000000002
pretty much done rambling [ __ ]

2042.95 --> 2049.45
oh dear I messed up my thingy Oh

2057.629 --> 2060.379
all right

2090.909 --> 2095.559
hmm

2093.399 --> 2098.49
how are you talking about you guys

2095.559 --> 2098.4900000000002
weirdos

2111.97 --> 2119.4199999999996
come on HM you don't it's just a story

2116.48 --> 2124.52
you know you don't have to take itself

2119.42 --> 2126.9500000000003
freakin literal like the movie is not

2124.52 --> 2132.86
trying to claim that that is real okay

2126.95 --> 2135.23
it's clearly science fiction and the

2132.86 --> 2138.01
entire set up the entire premise was

2135.23 --> 2141.17
kind of fascinating really

2138.01 --> 2147.8900000000003
it's just that the human part was kind

2141.17 --> 2150.82
of ridiculous that's all oh come on guys

2147.89 --> 2150.8199999999997
down

2170.04 --> 2173.9
what are you bickering about

2183.45 --> 2186.75
[Music]

2193.22 --> 2196.3399999999997
[Music]

2197.77 --> 2201.49
get back to Antarctica

2211.23 --> 2218.83
yeah that wasn't yeah but that was a

2214.75 --> 2220.72
funny thing about about this movie as

2218.83 --> 2225.16
well as how they basically came to this

2220.72 --> 2227.95
location it was supposedly a concealed

2225.16 --> 2231.43
island I was sitting in the middle of a

2227.95 --> 2233.71
perpetual storm in the outer sea

2231.43 --> 2237.73
especially in the Indian Ocean maybe

2233.71 --> 2239.41
Bermuda Triangle region somewhat I don't

2237.73 --> 2243.91
know exactly where but it was pretty

2239.41 --> 2246.19
much south so that was just fascinating

2243.91 --> 2248.23
about it so they're already kind of

2246.19 --> 2253.56
playing with the idea like oh maybe

2248.23 --> 2253.56
there's some hidden place down there I

2256.02 --> 2274.06
don't know what anyway yeah in reality

2271.44 --> 2277.29
finding an actual place it's going to be

2274.06 --> 2277.29
a little bit different

2285.24 --> 2293.08
and I have been wondering also just

2289.84 --> 2301.51
trying to size up a little bit better

2293.08 --> 2305.02
that what if our realm is indeed just

2301.51 --> 2308.53
one fragment of many realms or like the

2305.02 --> 2310.92
earth is supposedly the disk a a disc in

2308.53 --> 2313.4500000000003
the middle of a more open ocean and

2310.92 --> 2315.16
there's a deed that the art that the

2313.45 --> 2319.0299999999997
eyes ring is supposedly artificial

2315.16 --> 2322.6499999999996
somehow I don't know like inspired by

2319.03 --> 2325.63
the supposedly lost Chinese map thing

2322.65 --> 2329.86
right so if there are other cultures out

2325.63 --> 2333.37
there what would they be like what they

2329.86 --> 2339.9700000000003
would they be doing if you presuppose

2333.37 --> 2344.89
that before originally the earth realm

2339.97 --> 2347.8599999999997
that we know was not cut off so where

2344.89 --> 2350.5899999999997
are they now do are they aware do they

2347.86 --> 2354.61
have communications with here is there

2350.59 --> 2358.15
already relations do they have similar

2354.61 --> 2363.76
issues as we do or are they much more

2358.15 --> 2366.4900000000002
organized and and perfected and we we

2363.76 --> 2369.5200000000004
are specifically the subject to all

2366.49 --> 2371.1099999999997
these mental trials as it were that's

2369.52 --> 2373.66
what the earth realm may be for

2371.11 --> 2378.04
supposedly that kind of setup so I kind

2373.66 --> 2381.85
of wonder like what are these these we

2378.04 --> 2384.31
are potentially humans and others out

2381.85 --> 2386.73
there that could be in the realms beyond

2384.31 --> 2389.38
what would they be like what would their

2386.73 --> 2392.1
countries if if they even have countries

2389.38 --> 2395.1400000000003
or if they are absolutely uniform

2392.1 --> 2399.16
libertarian and like telepathic or

2395.14 --> 2401.5
something what are what will they be

2399.16 --> 2404.35
dealing with or do they have any issues

2401.5 --> 2406.48
or are they constantly just gazing at us

2404.35 --> 2409.5
because they basically fixed everything

2406.48 --> 2414.85
and we're like the only amusement left

2409.5 --> 2417.46
you know I start to wonder sometimes and

2414.85 --> 2418.06
that then you get to kind of a trubin

2417.46 --> 2422.4700000000003
set up

2418.06 --> 2426.099
and why not you have to realize if there

2422.47 --> 2428.41
is more civilizations out there then

2426.099 --> 2430.9900000000002
they have a certain level of

2428.41 --> 2434.14
consciousness and public consciousness

2430.99 --> 2436.75
and issues with their society as well

2434.14 --> 2438.06
however it's going to be one way or the

2436.75 --> 2441.34
other

2438.06 --> 2446.859
the ego always finds a way always finds

2441.34 --> 2450.9
an angle so what would they be like what

2446.859 --> 2454.84
how far would they have dwelt into the

2450.9 --> 2457.33
outsider logos or would they have held

2454.84 --> 2460.21
on to it and perfected upon it and built

2457.33 --> 2462.7599999999998
further upon it more than we can ever

2460.21 --> 2465.33
imagine because we literally went

2462.76 --> 2467.349
through generational physical

2465.33 --> 2468.97
transformation because of the things we

2467.349 --> 2473.13
were subjected to and they have not

2468.97 --> 2475.81
perhaps maybe they are almost like

2473.13 --> 2477.76
radiating beings because of that because

2475.81 --> 2483.67
they have not been damaged over the

2477.76 --> 2487.9900000000002
generations there's all these things

2483.67 --> 2490.29
that I can wonder about what are they

2487.99 --> 2490.29
like

2506.46 --> 2513.91
all right well I guess you guys are just

2511.99 --> 2516.18
hanging around oh and by the way Thank

2513.91 --> 2519.0099999999998
You Nathan for supporting my show and

2516.18 --> 2523.3599999999997
asking people to hit the superjet that

2519.01 --> 2525.48
would be nice not I'm not gonna directly

2523.36 --> 2528.31
complain what I haven't had any in in

2525.48 --> 2530.98
days but then again I asked basically

2528.31 --> 2534.58
not to do that because I'm being

2530.98 --> 2537.82
financially punished by my social

2534.58 --> 2543.1
welfare distributor literally for

2537.82 --> 2545.2000000000003
getting money from Google I still have

2543.1 --> 2548.47
to resolve those issues see what's going

2545.2 --> 2551.6499999999996
on but if people want to help me out

2548.47 --> 2558.8199999999997
financially that's not gonna have really

2551.65 --> 2561.94
yeah a zero and net a zero net end

2558.82 --> 2563.56
result then it would be best to donate

2561.94 --> 2567.31
to my paypal or through one of the other

2563.56 --> 2569.62
channels or one of the other options you

2567.31 --> 2573.42
can contribute in the description box

2569.62 --> 2573.42
below so thank you

2585.05 --> 2590.9
right well foraged it's from a

2587.87 --> 2592.8199999999997
perspective of think what can be done

2590.9 --> 2596.81
potentially with the technology we have

2592.82 --> 2598.6400000000003
what we can conceptualize now imagine

2596.81 --> 2601.0299999999997
that that would actually be allowed and

2598.64 --> 2607.5499999999997
now imagine that that has been applied

2601.03 --> 2612.17
over 50 generations without pretty much

2607.55 --> 2614.6000000000004
interruption and there will be like a

2612.17 --> 2621.02
nobility mindset issue where basically

2614.6 --> 2624.35
people are so sad so saturated with no

2621.02 --> 2629.75
more needs that need fulfilling that

2624.35 --> 2633.14
they will be literally just starving for

2629.75 --> 2635.45
anything interesting and they will use

2633.14 --> 2637.7599999999998
their technology to just observe [ __ ]

2635.45 --> 2639.95
it's kind of already in a microwave

2637.76 --> 2641.5400000000004
inning with our social media revolution

2639.95 --> 2643.46
look at all the people that are

2641.54 --> 2649.7599999999998
basically almost abandoning life and

2643.46 --> 2654.17
just watching [ __ ] all day and usually

2649.76 --> 2655.5800000000004
end up trolling also but yeah there's a

2654.17 --> 2657.98
lot of people that do that and don't

2655.58 --> 2660.2799999999997
really get anything out of it or barely

2657.98 --> 2660.28
anything

2663.26 --> 2669.26
and they just try to look for

2666.59 --> 2675.9100000000003
interesting things all day and I bet

2669.26 --> 2678.65
that well any super advanced unspoiled

2675.91 --> 2684.14
civilization outside of our realm that

2678.65 --> 2686.359
has like practically yeah perfect

2684.14 --> 2689.6
clairvoyant technology where they can

2686.359 --> 2692.5099999999998
just look over distance no matter what's

2689.6 --> 2695.7799999999997
in between that kind of thing that they

2692.51 --> 2697.9700000000003
could just like yeah just like sneak up

2695.78 --> 2701.3590000000004
and just see like what are they doing oh

2697.97 --> 2704.0899999999997
oh are they gonna have are these people

2701.359 --> 2706.19
are gonna have a fight again or I wonder

2704.09 --> 2709.07
if he's gonna actually see their make

2706.19 --> 2711.619
out they'll just make soap amusement

2709.07 --> 2714.2200000000003
from looking at people's daily life and

2711.619 --> 2718.96
they'll probably even be able to now

2714.22 --> 2721.64
also tap into the system of all things

2718.96 --> 2723.59
to make it even more amusing maybe that

2721.64 --> 2726.65
is even the reason why it was installed

2723.59 --> 2729.8500000000004
in the first place as an amusement set

2726.65 --> 2740.29
up for outside interfaces

2729.85 --> 2740.29
you know just gives another angle to it

2744.55 --> 2753.26
and would explain why I'm pretty

2748.97 --> 2755.9599999999996
convinced that since this is here we are

2753.26 --> 2758.96
all being watched maybe not by people

2755.96 --> 2760.67
even here in this realm but on the

2758.96 --> 2764.18
outside there's like people constantly

2760.67 --> 2766.25
watching and they're just cataloging in

2764.18 --> 2772.52
and saving their favorite episodes and

2766.25 --> 2773.93
of whatever they're doing you know or

2772.52 --> 2775.73
maybe they're already getting bored with

2773.93 --> 2777.83
us and they're like oh my god these guys

2775.73 --> 2787.4
are so stupid and insane this is just

2777.83 --> 2789.29
insane I don't know but I think they're

2787.4 --> 2793.27
probably a bit disappointed with how

2789.29 --> 2795.74
easily we get distracted by dumb [ __ ]

2793.27 --> 2798.47
but then again yeah they should know

2795.74 --> 2801.3199999999997
that we are constantly being poisoned

2798.47 --> 2805.1
compared to what they go through

2801.32 --> 2807.53
probably and despite us working back a

2805.1 --> 2810.11
little like the long-term damage from

2807.53 --> 2812.6000000000004
the generations back all of that is all

2810.11 --> 2816.9500000000003
still in there it's all still weakening

2812.6 --> 2819.02
us whatever we have become now and hey

2816.95 --> 2823.46
over time we might be able to completely

2819.02 --> 2825.68
reverse that detriment process and scale

2823.46 --> 2828.44
back up scale back into the original

2825.68 --> 2829.8399999999997
being that we were purify the original

2828.44 --> 2834.19
creation again within ourselves

2829.84 --> 2838.34
naturally just as crops can naturally

2834.19 --> 2843.35
outgrow GMO the GMO will just eventually

2838.34 --> 2845.38
die off and not appear back unless yeah

2843.35 --> 2847.19
it's constantly being replanted and

2845.38 --> 2850.55
repolarized and all that [ __ ] but

2847.19 --> 2852.29
eventually like it it seems to be it's

2850.55 --> 2855.0800000000004
gonna be bred out of existence so maybe

2852.29 --> 2857.42
if we don't get tampered with for long

2855.08 --> 2860.2999999999997
enough for plenty enough generations we

2857.42 --> 2865.52
will restore to our original full

2860.3 --> 2867.32
potential and I think that if we ever

2865.52 --> 2869.84
get to that point we'd see a psionic

2867.32 --> 2872.9900000000002
revolution where we basically all find

2869.84 --> 2874.88
out like Oh hmm okay this is kind of

2872.99 --> 2877.0589999999997
weird but I guess that we were all

2874.88 --> 2882.29
telepathically all along

2877.059 --> 2891.71
that kind of [ __ ] I'm serious it's not

2882.29 --> 2896.5099999999998
even a joke because I think that what I

2891.71 --> 2898.88
have achieved could be the normal in the

2896.51 --> 2901.19
future not talking about character

2898.88 --> 2903.859
expression but more like in the line of

2901.19 --> 2909.109
skill that I'm building on that could

2903.859 --> 2911.569
become normal that people have that

2909.109 --> 2916.13
ability to just see that deal with it

2911.569 --> 2918.17
and do incredible stuff just normal like

2916.13 --> 2920.48
help people out really quickly and

2918.17 --> 2924.29
effectively on the long run without many

2920.48 --> 2926.66
consequences and not prevent being

2924.29 --> 2931.27
poisoned recognizing deception better

2926.66 --> 2931.27
all those things that could be normal

2936.7 --> 2941.4399999999996
but you have to defend every generation

2939.099 --> 2945.67
against all the negative mental and

2941.44 --> 2952.63
toxic influences if to guard them very

2945.67 --> 2954.67
meticulously hmm and that's almost

2952.63 --> 2965.26
impossible in the in the Western society

2954.67 --> 2967.299
these days so anyway right going for 48

2965.26 --> 2971.17
minutes well I have more than an hour to

2967.299 --> 2974.2599999999998
go I'm still open for panelists anybody

2971.17 --> 2977.7400000000002
wants to join that really matters it

2974.26 --> 2980.5890000000004
doesn't really matter who as long as

2977.74 --> 2983.819
it's not somebody in the series trolling

2980.589 --> 2983.819
mood then I'm fine with it

2986.67 --> 2989.7490000000003
[Music]

2997.699 --> 3003.41
yeah any feedback by the way from my

3000.44 --> 3008.469
theories what what did you guys think

3003.41 --> 3013.009
about my electric universe based

3008.469 --> 3014.299
magnetic rail outer gas universe because

3013.009 --> 3017.93
I've been thinking more and more about

3014.299 --> 3019.849
it and I think that however ridiculous

3017.93 --> 3024.769
it kind of sounds of course especially

3019.849 --> 3028.309
from a flat earth perspective I think

3024.769 --> 3032.269
that it is like like seriously even from

3028.309 --> 3037.219
the from these priesthood side a viable

3032.269 --> 3039.229
option I think with the power of math as

3037.219 --> 3041.739
it were as Owen Benjamin even

3039.229 --> 3046.9689999999996
demonstrated in a very ridiculing way

3041.739 --> 3053.289
but it could be made so and it would

3046.969 --> 3059.299
make movie or even the trickery easier

3053.289 --> 3065.3590000000004
but yeah could it ever be transitioned

3059.299 --> 3067.7889999999998
convincingly enough then again yeah it

3065.359 --> 3071.39
all depends I guess in how far humans

3067.789 --> 3074.779
will be able to be sent away supposedly

3071.39 --> 3076.609
pretty supposedly because it's pretty

3074.779 --> 3083.89
supposedly they have never been beyond

3076.609 --> 3086.949
the moon so then since the moon is

3083.89 --> 3091.249
supposedly in the atmosphere then maybe

3086.949 --> 3093.289
they just don't know for certain and it

3091.249 --> 3096.4689999999996
might actually turn out that I'm right

3093.289 --> 3099.259
and it is all I owe in gas and it's not

3096.469 --> 3101.7490000000003
as they thought before there's no orbits

3099.259 --> 3103.19
because of falling gravity no it might

3101.749 --> 3107.7189999999996
actually turn out to be an out of gas

3103.19 --> 3110.15
universe and there's no slowing down of

3107.719 --> 3112.279
the movement because all the orbits of

3110.15 --> 3115.039
the things are in some kind of magnetic

3112.279 --> 3117.229
rail correlating with the electric

3115.039 --> 3120.4100000000003
universe concept of how the Sun even

3117.229 --> 3124.299
functions in that setup so I think this

3120.41 --> 3126.529
is serious this of course still

3124.299 --> 3128.88
presupposing that the earth would be a

3126.529 --> 3132.52
globe in a giant fast outer room

3128.88 --> 3135.15
which could be technically proven easier

3132.52 --> 3141.22
because there's no vacuum in the way

3135.15 --> 3145.69
right but and that would make rocket

3141.22 --> 3152.8199999999997
travel all that possible yeah that's why

3145.69 --> 3152.82
I say it's serious it's not a joke and

3153.9 --> 3158.7400000000002
yeah we'll see if anything like that is

3156.73 --> 3162.31
good ever gonna happen if they're ever

3158.74 --> 3165.0699999999997
going to go that direction but I think

3162.31 --> 3168.2799999999997
that if they want to try to continue

3165.07 --> 3171.07
going on as it were forever and keep the

3168.28 --> 3174.3100000000004
storytelling Guild going whatever the

3171.07 --> 3178.8
world actually believes then I think

3174.31 --> 3178.7999999999997
that this is the only real viable option

3178.98 --> 3186.52
because otherwise everything else would

3181.3 --> 3187.6600000000003
be so discouraged and hey it all depends

3186.52 --> 3191.2599999999998
on what you're gonna do with it of

3187.66 --> 3194.6499999999996
course but if they suggest like wait

3191.26 --> 3196.51
maybe it's not that difficult after all

3194.65 --> 3199.57
now that we've overcome mechanical

3196.51 --> 3203.17
complications we can potentially

3199.57 --> 3206.71
colonize the universe and then lots of

3203.17 --> 3208.9900000000002
people would start to line up and like

3206.71 --> 3214.48
oh my god finally this is our dream well

3208.99 --> 3216.7
they'll be open for anything so it all

3214.48 --> 3218.92
depends on what they're gonna try out

3216.7 --> 3224.16
with that if they're actually gonna like

3218.92 --> 3227.89
try like a virtual simulation or maybe a

3224.16 --> 3229.72
combined drug induced hypnosis thing

3227.89 --> 3231.5499999999997
where they could try to make people

3229.72 --> 3233.89
experience that kind of thing and I

3231.55 --> 3238.2400000000002
think that maybe even spaceforce maybe

3233.89 --> 3240.6099999999997
the trial stages of trying this out so

3238.24 --> 3243.75
they could experience virtual space

3240.61 --> 3248.53
combat that they just thought was real

3243.75 --> 3251.65
as part of a narrative it would be very

3248.53 --> 3253.3
bizarre there may be people that will

3251.65 --> 3255.1
fail that would go through that would

3253.3 --> 3258.19
figure it out and some of them would

3255.1 --> 3260.39
just lash onto it and never let go

3258.19 --> 3263.15
because it means so much to them

3260.39 --> 3265.91
that they did that they defended earth

3263.15 --> 3270.099
against aliens or something you know so

3265.91 --> 3272.5989999999997
I think there is more potential

3270.099 --> 3274.6400000000003
basically whether do we actually

3272.599 --> 3275.839
physically go to space and that's

3274.64 --> 3281.269
probably not gonna happen

3275.839 --> 3283.099
even if it was there then there is

3281.269 --> 3286.819
something that they could do to keep on

3283.099 --> 3290.4500000000003
the storytelling build about the outer

3286.819 --> 3292.19
space universe about a gas universe is

3290.45 --> 3295.0389999999998
what it should become then so that's

3292.19 --> 3299.349
just my train of thought in that

3295.039 --> 3308.329
direction yeah

3299.349 --> 3313.19
dark matter now dark matter is is a yeah

3308.329 --> 3315.619
a huge band-aid mathematical it's a huge

3313.19 --> 3318.619
mathematical band-aid to solve an

3315.619 --> 3320.809
equation that is obviously broken that

3318.619 --> 3321.559
is what it is I don't think it exists in

3320.809 --> 3324.4990000000003
any sense

3321.559 --> 3332.739
and hey in an outer gas universe you

3324.499 --> 3338.2099999999996
don't need it you don't need it so yeah

3332.739 --> 3340.489
the old model is just ridiculous it's

3338.21 --> 3341.809
technobabble nonsense basically that's

3340.489 --> 3346.609
what it's become technobabble

3341.809 --> 3350.71
mathematical nonsense sir real band-aids

3346.609 --> 3354.519
that make no damn sense drowning in ten

3350.71 --> 3354.5190000000002
presuppositional tangents

3356.95 --> 3360.08
[Music]

3365.84 --> 3369.6290000000004
[Music]

3372.18 --> 3381.19
gasps PJ I replaced it with gas a

3376.18 --> 3384.5499999999997
slightly lower gas pressure not a lot

3381.19 --> 3388.39
lower slightly lower but I'll be filled

3384.55 --> 3391.3900000000003
with gas and all the orbits of all the

3388.39 --> 3393.25
objects celestial objects would keep

3391.39 --> 3395.3799999999997
their momentum because they were not

3393.25 --> 3399.64
falling due to gravity and being slowed

3395.38 --> 3402.82
down by the gas friction but they would

3399.64 --> 3407.2
be kept in their orbit by a magnetic

3402.82 --> 3411.2200000000003
rail effect a specific pathway that

3407.2 --> 3415.18
pushes it in a specific speed in an

3411.22 --> 3418.1499999999996
orbit and that would be derived from the

3415.18 --> 3422.9199999999996
same electromagnetic energy that causes

3418.15 --> 3427.1800000000003
the Sun to burn the gas of the Sun like

3422.92 --> 3429.67
a lamp like a gas lamp that's the

3427.18 --> 3431.95
morality root foundation of that model

3429.67 --> 3435.46
it's an extrapolation on the original

3431.95 --> 3437.41
electric universe theory which I which

3435.46 --> 3440.68
before Flat Earth I thought like that's

3437.41 --> 3443.44
it that must be it everything else that

3440.68 --> 3448.48
would deny is just an idiot that's what

3443.44 --> 3450.61
I thought back then and yeah now I'm

3448.48 --> 3456.96
basically using it as a presupposition

3450.61 --> 3459.73
no building to model it out further and

3456.96 --> 3463.84
this is what I've come up with and it

3459.73 --> 3466.42
solves a lot of things it makes gravity

3463.84 --> 3468.61
different gravity doesn't now doesn't

3466.42 --> 3470.91
suppose to it doesn't have to keep the

3468.61 --> 3475.21
gas to the planet opposing a vacuum

3470.91 --> 3479.91
there's no friction problems the Sun

3475.21 --> 3479.91
hydrogen burning nonsense is solved

3480.18 --> 3487.29
because there's no burning up in that

3482.59 --> 3490.23
sense and yeah

3487.29 --> 3494.52
it makes more sense really and if you

3490.23 --> 3504.119
presuppose gravity makes balls stick

3494.52 --> 3506.0099999999998
together of of heavier matter mostly now

3504.119 --> 3509.04
of course there remains a few issues so

3506.01 --> 3509.6400000000003
I look I'm not saying uh I love this so

3509.04 --> 3512.34
much

3509.64 --> 3518.49
yeah maybe I'm not gonna be flat earther

3512.34 --> 3520.9500000000003
anymore new like you know what if

3518.49 --> 3524.0099999999998
there's people out there interested in

3520.95 --> 3525.7799999999997
this concept I want me to extrapolate on

3524.01 --> 3528.21
this model I'll do it and if they're

3525.78 --> 3530.07
like really allergic to Flat Earth I'll

3528.21 --> 3532.92
even be able to completely leave that

3530.07 --> 3537.869
out as I pretty much have been doing for

3532.92 --> 3541.41
the last hour with this but that doesn't

3537.869 --> 3543.48
mean that I'm gonna like really imagine

3541.41 --> 3547.109
it to be a real or that I'm gonna say

3543.48 --> 3549.48
like this is reality you'll never catch

3547.109 --> 3552.99
me doing that I'll say like this is

3549.48 --> 3554.82
inevitable that kind of thing like it if

3552.99 --> 3557.1
you're gonna have to if you want the

3554.82 --> 3558.9300000000003
model to function it has to be this I

3557.1 --> 3563.52
will definitely be saying that kind of

3558.93 --> 3565.3799999999997
thing but I could even yeah I could put

3563.52 --> 3571.02
this model out there what does a

3565.38 --> 3571.59
storyteller I can do that I'm a Cosmo

3571.02 --> 3574.28
genius

3571.59 --> 3578.13
I understand how that works i

3574.28 --> 3582.32
conceptualize and puzzle together worlds

3578.13 --> 3582.32
and universes

3586.66 --> 3595.91
alright yeah looky Kevin hello yeah well

3594.199 --> 3598.88
why do I even know the earth is flat

3595.91 --> 3602.1499999999996
well I definitely know it's not a ball

3598.88 --> 3604.369
of the presupposed size that they tell

3602.15 --> 3607.359
us it is pretty damn sure about that

3604.369 --> 3610.549
because there is no curvature and the

3607.359 --> 3613.88
obstruction or rather the concealment

3610.549 --> 3616.069
rate due to the limited viewing angle

3613.88 --> 3617.809
and the diffraction limit in general

3616.069 --> 3619.729
with you and there is an obstruction

3617.809 --> 3623.7090000000003
from tidal bulges when you look at the

3619.729 --> 3626.8999999999996
coast at times but all that combines

3623.709 --> 3628.3999999999996
yeah the obstruction rate as I formerly

3626.9 --> 3630.169
called which is more technically the

3628.4 --> 3632.2090000000003
consume and rate of things in the

3630.169 --> 3633.739
distance at the horizon at the apparent

3632.209 --> 3637.3689999999997
horizon because the horizon is always

3633.739 --> 3641.599
apparent the obstruction rate is linear

3637.369 --> 3645.079
over distance that's very telling that

3641.599 --> 3647.3590000000004
means that the further away the object

3645.079 --> 3652.849
is you're looking at over the flat plane

3647.359 --> 3657.439
you're looking over the higher the more

3652.849 --> 3661.759
of that thing that is visible below is

3657.439 --> 3664.249
concealed or rather within the Mirage in

3661.759 --> 3668.119
zone so it will be subjected to either a

3664.249 --> 3670.1299999999997
reflection of itself or outdone by

3668.119 --> 3674.2690000000002
something else but it usually ends up in

3670.13 --> 3677.569
being a reflection from that point on

3674.269 --> 3680.5389999999998
and that rate of that at concealment

3677.569 --> 3687.189
rate of how much is below that mirroring

3680.539 --> 3690.529
effect over the distance is linear

3687.189 --> 3692.6299999999997
that's why I originally in describing

3690.529 --> 3695.119
the optical slant here I called it a

3692.63 --> 3700.429
slice out of sight because it is

3695.119 --> 3702.949
literally a linear slice that gets

3700.429 --> 3706.579
higher the further way it goes at a

3702.949 --> 3710.4790000000003
linear rate and that linear deduction

3706.579 --> 3713.809
right there for me is geometric Oh

3710.479 --> 3717.6499999999996
irrefutable evidence that the earth is

3713.809 --> 3721.13
not measurably deducible

3717.65 --> 3723.17
curved or if it is curved it is so

3721.13 --> 3726.559
minutely curved that it can never be the

3723.17 --> 3730.9300000000003
presupposed sized ball that they say it

3726.559 --> 3733.73
is it might be a ginormous insane

3730.93 --> 3735.5589999999997
presupposed jupiter-sized ball or

3733.73 --> 3739.099
something of which we would just be a

3735.559 --> 3741.44
little segment that might in some way be

3739.099 --> 3743.569
a possibility but then everything about

3741.44 --> 3745.88
physics would work completely different

3743.569 --> 3748.4
gravity would not be what they say it is

3745.88 --> 3750.02
the outer universe and space would not

3748.4 --> 3751.609
be what they say it is none of it would

3750.02 --> 3754.7
be what they say it is but it might be a

3751.609 --> 3758.299
ball that's the only thing you'd believe

3754.7 --> 3762.47
be left with from the original system

3758.299 --> 3769.21
that you believe in so that's my answer

3762.47 --> 3773.0589999999997
to that the linear concealment rate of

3769.21 --> 3777.38
things in the distance visible that is

3773.059 --> 3781.7000000000003
to be a empirical deduced geometrical

3777.38 --> 3785.569
the deuced proof that the earth is flat

3781.7 --> 3788.6299999999997
and not curved because it's linear not

3785.569 --> 3790.849
curved that means therefore per default

3788.63 --> 3793.369
you have can draw geometrical

3790.849 --> 3795.8900000000003
conclusions if it's not curved and thus

3793.369 --> 3798.5
is flat it's a linear rate it's flat

3795.89 --> 3802.22
that means it's flat it can never be

3798.5 --> 3807.19
anything I also have flat so there you

3802.22 --> 3811.1899999999996
go widespread geometrically deduced

3807.19 --> 3812.7200000000003
optical based empirical deduced evidence

3811.19 --> 3815.15
why the earth is flat

3812.72 --> 3817.4599999999996
there's not scientific proof but it's

3815.15 --> 3820.069
pretty much everything else and this is

3817.46 --> 3824.809
just one element of it because there's

3820.069 --> 3828.349
more but this to me is the most one of

3824.809 --> 3830.9900000000002
the better ones that I like to explain

3828.349 --> 3834.099
very elaborately every time because it

3830.99 --> 3834.0989999999997
is really something

3842.16 --> 3847.2
bending of light due to magnetic field

3845.43 --> 3849.72
why I don't think that there's natural

3847.2 --> 3851.73
magnetic fields present from the earth

3849.72 --> 3855.1189999999997
that are strong enough to actually bend

3851.73 --> 3858.9
light like that and it would be

3855.119 --> 3863.4300000000003
irregular so just because you can like

3858.9 --> 3865.23
turn on a an electromagnet and then make

3863.43 --> 3866.64
it so strong that it could actually Bend

3865.23 --> 3871.829
like that doesn't mean that actually

3866.64 --> 3875.1189999999997
happens in nature okay that definitely

3871.829 --> 3875.119
does not happen in nature

3893.74 --> 3896.3689999999997
dude

3905.01 --> 3911.3190000000004
Jesus Rick Dawkins get a grip on

3909.22 --> 3916.99
yourself man what the hell is wrong with

3911.319 --> 3918.3089999999997
you why you should trigger you're

3916.99 --> 3921.45
getting a timeline for this

3918.309 --> 3921.4500000000003
it's a ridiculous

3932.54 --> 3935.38
what

3939.78 --> 3943.4900000000002
how's that even possible

3950.89 --> 3955.77
do you have two accounts at the same

3953.2 --> 3955.77
time

3962.27 --> 3969.29
weird okay I guess that's what he does

3967.28 --> 3972.53
when he wants to spam quickly enough

3969.29 --> 3977.3
because there is a short delay that I

3972.53 --> 3979.7000000000003
put in to prevent bot spam but yeah to

3977.3 --> 3982.4500000000003
accounts to bypass that NIT

3979.7 --> 3982.45
don't do that

3998.81 --> 4006.11
please looky Kalyan really the bending

4003.29 --> 4009.44
of light is actually circular due to the

4006.11 --> 4012.1400000000003
earth magnetic fuel over distance really

4009.44 --> 4014.87
have you actually seen the magnetic

4012.14 --> 4018.77
field of the earth recently looky Keelan

4014.87 --> 4024.0699999999997
you know there's maps of it have you

4018.77 --> 4029.06
ever seen that magnetic field guess what

4024.07 --> 4031.8500000000004
it's not in a constant it's pretty weird

4029.06 --> 4035.81
and irregular in its strength and even

4031.85 --> 4041.0
directions and that doesn't make any

4035.81 --> 4044.5099999999998
sense that will not make light Bend in a

4041.0 --> 4047.09
regular fashion like that it's gonna be

4044.51 --> 4050.3300000000004
all over the place if that is gonna have

4047.09 --> 4052.79
that presumed influences which really

4050.33 --> 4056.21
does not because that magnetic field is

4052.79 --> 4066.16
not strong enough to influence light

4056.21 --> 4070.06
like that so you might want to try

4066.16 --> 4073.1
reviewing that stand point right there

4070.06 --> 4075.41
because it is kind of ridiculous and

4073.1 --> 4078.89
totally unproven by physics and optics

4075.41 --> 4081.5899999999997
really like just because you can bend

4078.89 --> 4083.0
light in some local way with some device

4081.59 --> 4085.19
that doesn't mean that that actually

4083.0 --> 4088.36
naturally happens and if you're gonna

4085.19 --> 4093.05
claim that electromagnetism causes that

4088.36 --> 4096.589
by amping up some electromagnets with

4093.05 --> 4098.6
electricity and causing a really strong

4096.589 --> 4101.66
field and then seeing light been saying

4098.6 --> 4106.04
oh yeah see that's normal well that's

4101.66 --> 4110.93
not that's not an accurate portrayal of

4106.04 --> 4112.64
how it works in nature you don't know

4110.93 --> 4114.589
that it does that you have no proof of

4112.64 --> 4119.4800000000005
that just because you can create

4114.589 --> 4122.29
something local with some not to scale

4119.48 --> 4122.29
effects

4122.859 --> 4128.01
it's ridiculous sorry

4131.0 --> 4138.19
you're not listening local long distance

4134.93 --> 4140.39
is allowed I'm saying to you is that the

4138.19 --> 4143.719999999999
demonstration for light bending through

4140.39 --> 4146.72
magnetism is because of the critical

4143.72 --> 4148.7300000000005
strength of that magnet that is what

4146.72 --> 4153.2
even influences it in the first place

4148.73 --> 4156.5599999999995
apparently so what I'm saying is is that

4153.2 --> 4160.82
the Earth's magnetic field is not even

4156.56 --> 4163.820000000001
close to that strength not even in the

4160.82 --> 4165.83
near vicinity and who says that it's

4163.82 --> 4167.2699999999995
even gonna have any influence I don't

4165.83 --> 4170.54
think it will I don't think it will have

4167.27 --> 4174.17
any influences otherwise you would see

4170.54 --> 4177.53
light bending constantly over through

4174.17 --> 4182.93
effects like two perfectly opposing

4177.53 --> 4185.71
mirrors would have weird there would be

4182.93 --> 4189.200000000001
stuff going on with that it's just no

4185.71 --> 4191.09
it's ridiculous the Earth's magnetic

4189.2 --> 4193.51
field is not strong enough to influence

4191.09 --> 4193.51
light

4196.17 --> 4199.4
there's no proof of that

4204.38 --> 4209.0
yeah and even if it would even never

4206.42 --> 4210.71
would that kind of scale well look at

4209.0 --> 4212.84
the Earth's magnetic strength field it

4210.71 --> 4215.42
is totally all over the place that would

4212.84 --> 4218.12
make no damn sense what we would see

4215.42 --> 4221.5
would all be warped depending on the

4218.12 --> 4238.73
location doesn't make any damn sense

4221.5 --> 4241.87
it's a broken setup yeah you're welcome

4238.73 --> 4241.87
proficient pirate

4252.289 --> 4256.679
yes Jose we know what you're doing you

4254.969 --> 4269.67
don't have to explain yourself every

4256.679 --> 4273.15
time anyway I feel like getting smoked

4269.67 --> 4275.099
so since I'm gonna have a long show and

4273.15 --> 4277.888999999999
don't think guests are gonna pop by I'm

4275.099 --> 4281.869000000001
just gonna do this maybe be guests will

4277.889 --> 4281.869
pop by it I'm still open for it

4285.88 --> 4297.4400000000005
all right okay well Michael

4289.84 --> 4299.96
Miguel yet McGillicutty how strong is

4297.44 --> 4307.04
the Earth's magnetic field and then

4299.96 --> 4309.8
compare it to electromagnets and then

4307.04 --> 4312.29
also by the way yeah take a good gaze at

4309.8 --> 4314.89
the irregularity in the strengths of the

4312.29 --> 4316.7
earth my night magnetic field and then

4314.89 --> 4319.160000000001
see ya

4316.7 --> 4323.05
you see is that strong enough to do

4319.16 --> 4325.94
anything and not just mathematically

4323.05 --> 4329.6
dilute it by saying ah because of the

4325.94 --> 4333.74
distance it will know how do you know

4329.6 --> 4339.47
there yeah it will keep on influencing

4333.74 --> 4342.86
light under a certain scale you have to

4339.47 --> 4346.79
actually prove that so demonstrating the

4342.86 --> 4350.87
heavy electromagnets bending light setup

4346.79 --> 4353.09
doesn't prove that very low magnetism

4350.87 --> 4358.01
also bends like you actually have to

4353.09 --> 4359.95
prove them because your suggestion that

4358.01 --> 4364.01
just because you can mathematically

4359.95 --> 4365.9
dilute it and then put that over that

4364.01 --> 4367.76
vast distance that it would always work

4365.9 --> 4373.19
you first have to prove that it even

4367.76 --> 4376.7
does work and at low intensity and it's

4373.19 --> 4380.589999999999
not twisting a message this is real you

4376.7 --> 4384.62
have no proof that very low magnetic

4380.59 --> 4389.17
field strength has any influence on

4384.62 --> 4389.17
light at all you have no proof

4391.09 --> 4398.87
and if you if you do I'd like to see it

4395.23 --> 4401.44
you would like to read it up on that so

4398.87 --> 4401.44
good luck

4404.41 --> 4407.739
[Music]

4417.93 --> 4425.88
well no not Luke kaylynn not a magnetic

4422.74 --> 4430.84
field a magnetic field of the earth

4425.88 --> 4434.11
strength that kind of magnetic field

4430.84 --> 4436.81
prove it prove it that that type of

4434.11 --> 4439.32
magnetic intensity when light is

4436.81 --> 4442.200000000001
subjected to it that does it even work

4439.32 --> 4446.799999999999
if it is even subjective oh that's

4442.2 --> 4450.01
anyway because who says that

4446.8 --> 4454.33
think about it does magnetism actually

4450.01 --> 4458.2300000000005
bend light or does magnetism alter the

4454.33 --> 4465.99
medium the light goes through in order

4458.23 --> 4465.99
for the light to deviate its path so

4466.53 --> 4472.179999999999
that's what you get when you when you

4468.94 --> 4474.99
deduce all these things from these first

4472.18 --> 4474.990000000001
experiments

4476.1 --> 4485.070000000001
so yeah proof that that a magnet magnet

4481.41 --> 4492.48
the magnetic field of the earth strength

4485.07 --> 4492.48
can actually bend light there you go

4493.989 --> 4500.48
and to be fair I don't think it does

4496.51 --> 4503.21
because and now I'm basing this roughly

4500.48 --> 4506.299999999999
on a rough insight my knowledge of how

4503.21 --> 4508.61
certain types of lasers work I think

4506.3 --> 4512.03
what they do is they basically project

4508.61 --> 4514.3099999999995
light into a room that is a full-on

4512.03 --> 4519.009999999999
mirror room that keeps on reflecting it

4514.31 --> 4523.88
and that amplifies the effect I think

4519.01 --> 4527.33
but think about it if light would be

4523.88 --> 4529.13
extremely many times reflecting it would

4527.33 --> 4532.73
be traveling that distance or it would

4529.13 --> 4534.41
have to scale manifest that distance

4532.73 --> 4535.699
however you'll to conceptualize light

4534.41 --> 4537.739
whether it's a particle or an

4535.699 --> 4540.679999999999
instantaneous beam it's going to have to

4537.739 --> 4544.4
scale that distance if magnetic the

4540.68 --> 4547.88
regular magnetic field of the earth is

4544.4 --> 4550.989
present during that entire set up then

4547.88 --> 4554.39
over distance there will start to come

4550.989 --> 4558.199
magnetic deviation bendings and that

4554.39 --> 4560.39
would make it very difficult for such a

4558.199 --> 4562.849999999999
laser device to function you would have

4560.39 --> 4564.860000000001
to account for that can you account for

4562.85 --> 4569.96
that how do you do that I don't think it

4564.86 --> 4574.66
does so there's just another reason why

4569.96 --> 4577.969
I think it doesn't work the regular

4574.66 --> 4582.699
strength of the Earth's magnetic field

4577.969 --> 4582.699
is not strong enough to influence light

4583.7 --> 4588.61
[Music]

4585.83 --> 4588.61
that's it

4603.17 --> 4605.1990000000005
ah

4606.86 --> 4614.2699999999995
right so the Sun C now the Sun is no

4612.26 --> 4617.87
longer in my room and it's freshening up

4614.27 --> 4620.240000000001
a little because that yeah after 2

4617.87 --> 4620.8099999999995
o'clock the Sun just no longer hits my

4620.24 --> 4624.639999999999
room

4620.81 --> 4624.64
it parallels it

4642.23 --> 4652.2699999999995
yeah truth is truth he made it up he

4646.1 --> 4652.27
figured it out that's where he got it

4658.65 --> 4667.65
ah yeah I'm getting a bit slow so sorry

4665.49 --> 4671.969999999999
for slowing down but yeah I've been gone

4667.65 --> 4675.8099999999995
for over an hour 50 minutes kind of need

4671.97 --> 4678.93
a break but I will keep on going I'll be

4675.81 --> 4682.13
back after that and I'll round out the

4678.93 --> 4682.13
show at 3 o'clock

4688.86 --> 4694.139
and I need a rig be back into it

4816.96 --> 4820.139
welcome back

4821.81 --> 4825.049
[Music]

4828.9 --> 4835.589999999999
alright yeah looky Kalin I on to the

4833.97 --> 4837.33
next subject a fraction

4835.59 --> 4840.96
I already addressed that in the

4837.33 --> 4845.28
beginning of my conceptualization and

4840.96 --> 4847.29
how do it physically appears to you from

4845.28 --> 4853.08
a non-biased standpoint the obstacles

4847.29 --> 4857.58
slant and yeah the horizon the apparent

4853.08 --> 4861.63
horizons and the hidden zone that are

4857.58 --> 4864.2699999999995
concealed and it's all yeah it's all

4861.63 --> 4870.33
part of optics diffraction limit limited

4864.27 --> 4873.150000000001
viewing angle there is this all that and

4870.33 --> 4874.11
sometimes yeah when water is concerned

4873.15 --> 4878.099999999999
with waves

4874.11 --> 4881.12
there's also tiled or bulging sometimes

4878.1 --> 4883.860000000001
in the way it really does get in the way

4881.12 --> 4885.75
cause everything that's much closer to

4883.86 --> 4888.839999999999
you it's gonna be a lot bigger compared

4885.75 --> 4892.23
to everything in the back it's gonna be

4888.84 --> 4895.14
tiny angular wise in comparison so it

4892.23 --> 4898.0199999999995
will cover up significantly a tidal

4895.14 --> 4900.54
bulge but beside that there's also the

4898.02 --> 4902.490000000001
diffraction limit and the flat plane

4900.54 --> 4905.01
you're looking over and it will manifest

4902.49 --> 4908.3099999999995
in the parent horizon at some point and

4905.01 --> 4913.92
a mirage in zone beyond that they'll

4908.31 --> 4916.35
grow in its height in its actual height

4913.92 --> 4921.08
of what it conceals what it reflects in

4916.35 --> 4924.71
everything linear wise over distance

4921.08 --> 4924.71
that's what's going on

4935.83 --> 4947.6
hey yellow Riley want me to phone you in

4942.37 --> 4949.5199999999995
if you have something to share or you're

4947.6 --> 4958.120000000001
gonna wait for the debates but to do

4949.52 --> 4958.120000000001
that you're on about gravity again

4959.53 --> 4964.84
Eggman

4961.45 --> 4964.84
dr. Eggman

4999.149 --> 5004.629
Oh God why

5073.14 --> 5075.17
Oh

5078.659 --> 5087.8099999999995
Oh God right okay yeah I'm just gonna

5082.739 --> 5090.0
call you if you want to lecture them if

5087.81 --> 5111.030000000001
you want to lecture my chat for gravity

5090.0 --> 5114.02
here's your chance I guess not well you

5111.03 --> 5114.0199999999995
want to get back in here

5149.68 --> 5152.68
guys

5165.609 --> 5173.109
yeah of course I'm rolling inside out

5167.679 --> 5175.809
what do you think that's a anxious to

5173.109 --> 5184.8
smoke all that extra paper thank you

5175.809 --> 5184.8
very much all right

5188.879 --> 5196.479
as you all know I don't really smoke in

5191.859 --> 5199.629000000001
front of the camera so yeah and it is

5196.479 --> 5201.070000000001
like I don't know I don't know maybe if

5199.629 --> 5204.369
you're like on a vacation or something

5201.07 --> 5207.339
this is kind of okay to do but normally

5204.369 --> 5210.308999999999
yeah kids seriously I didn't even do

5207.339 --> 5214.269
this when I was like very young don't

5210.309 --> 5217.539
smoke in the day don't start smoking

5214.269 --> 5220.229
like in the early afternoon it's not

5217.539 --> 5220.228999999999
recommended

5223.1 --> 5231.22
unless you have like really fun things

5226.88 --> 5234.8
to do you know how to handle it

5231.22 --> 5240.05
but be careful with drugs even with

5234.8 --> 5246.1900000000005
cannabis especially when you're young so

5240.05 --> 5246.1900000000005
but I'm gonna enjoy this outside

5365.83 --> 5369.61
it's pretty nice out there

5385.29 --> 5387.92
right

5473.32 --> 5481.71
yeah that was nice

5477.06 --> 5481.71
all right he does want to come on cool

5484.57 --> 5505.12
oh hey good afternoon how are we doing

5500.83 --> 5506.14
great how are you I'm good let me it's

5505.12 --> 5508.83
gonna turn off some noise in the

5506.14 --> 5508.83
background one sec

5510.05 --> 5513.249
[Music]

5543.96 --> 5550.84
he stood ever yeah of course but you

5548.92 --> 5553.119
joined and you were like I saw an empty

5550.84 --> 5554.38
seat and then I saw you are for a cig I

5553.119 --> 5555.28
thought it must be a slow day in their

5554.38 --> 5559.4490000000005
camp our wind today

5555.28 --> 5561.509999999999
slow day I started at one at 12 o'clock

5559.449 --> 5564.699
for you so

5561.51 --> 5566.17
I actually got the notifying I was like

5564.699 --> 5571.558999999999
and I was you wet the bed what's going

5566.17 --> 5576.01
on I just wanted to go on early away

5571.559 --> 5581.4400000000005
Wafaa mist and if any of any evidence

5576.01 --> 5585.76
for a force of gravitiy Howard Wow it's

5581.44 --> 5592.719
very easy to presuppose it is that's the

5585.76 --> 5596.619000000001
Dawn Treader right yep but I did talk

5592.719 --> 5599.59
again about the the electric universe

5596.619 --> 5603.61
based outer gas universe with the

5599.59 --> 5606.159000000001
magnetic rail orbit orbit system I did

5603.61 --> 5608.53
extrapolate a little on that and yeah it

5606.159 --> 5611.549999999999
shared my views on that on the long run

5608.53 --> 5614.469
that I think that probably NASA as a

5611.55 --> 5617.469
science fiction story Terry telling

5614.469 --> 5620.559
guilt may eventually be forced to go on

5617.469 --> 5622.63
that route just like they did with the

5620.559 --> 5624.76
moon with the moon being in the

5622.63 --> 5627.519
atmosphere and I even explain how that

5624.76 --> 5629.769
worked because we're half humans

5627.519 --> 5631.51
supposedly been well up till the moon

5629.769 --> 5634.929
that's as far as humans have come

5631.51 --> 5636.9400000000005
supposedly right well so if they now

5634.929 --> 5639.61
concluded that there's atmosphere on the

5636.94 --> 5642.19
moon lighter than on the earth that

5639.61 --> 5645.518999999999
means that they don't have that they

5642.19 --> 5649.0
have not physically experienced outer

5645.519 --> 5651.7300000000005
space really that there could

5649.0 --> 5655.84
potentially still be gas everywhere they

5651.73 --> 5659.049999999999
just misjudged it see could all turn out

5655.84 --> 5661.329
to be different that's the weird thing

5659.05 --> 5664.9890000000005
about how it that works what what they

5661.329 --> 5667.659
can do as a priesthood with the

5664.989 --> 5669.638999999999
presuppositions it's all shuttling with

5667.659 --> 5672.94
math and if it works out they could oh

5669.639 --> 5675.429
we were wrong apparently that's how to

5672.94 --> 5677.74
do it and I think that they'll be forced

5675.429 --> 5681.55
to go into the outer gas UniFirst

5677.74 --> 5684.19
electric electric some all based on

5681.55 --> 5687.85
magnetic real orbits instead of a

5684.19 --> 5690.61
supposed n Stein gravity fall thing and

5687.85 --> 5692.38
in this electric universe gravity would

5690.61 --> 5696.94
even still be there it would just not be

5692.38 --> 5700.92
such a dominant role it would be the

5696.94 --> 5700.919999999999
weak force it is presupposed to be real

5701.76 --> 5705.37
dude listen I need to go because I've

5704.29 --> 5708.2699999999995
just got something for the poster just

5705.37 --> 5712.78
need to make a phone call I'll give you

5708.27 --> 5714.13
it no it's it's just it's just that

5712.78 --> 5716.53
important I need to make a phone call

5714.13 --> 5717.49
I'll come I'll give you a call back in

5716.53 --> 5720.94
about three minutes

5717.49 --> 5722.08
Oh what are those I'll just stick myself

5720.94 --> 5722.889999999999
on mute for a couple of minutes while on

5722.08 --> 5723.97
the right in the phone call yeah that's

5722.89 --> 5727.450000000001
also fine

5723.97 --> 5729.52
cool I'll be working exactly okay so

5727.45 --> 5732.82
Riley's gonna convey with his colleagues

5729.52 --> 5741.700000000001
now with the agency how to respond to

5732.82 --> 5744.2699999999995
this needs to convey with this

5741.7 --> 5744.2699999999995
think-tank

5750.569 --> 5754.939
god

5751.29 --> 5754.939
[Music]

5761.88 --> 5768.169
[Music]

5769.749 --> 5773.559
Oh God you know what I might actually do

5773.11 --> 5775.119
that

5773.559 --> 5782.46
although Riley's probably not gonna

5775.119 --> 5786.639
thank me for it all right Brenda why not

5782.46 --> 5788.999
at least you showed up before or 50

5786.639 --> 5795.039
minutes before the end of the show so

5788.999 --> 5797.728999999999
guess that kind of qualifies let's see

5795.039 --> 5797.728999999999
you were yeah

5803.219 --> 5805.969
okay

5825.06 --> 5827.75
hello

5829.92 --> 5832.61
hello

5834.11 --> 5839.389999999999
hello

5835.699 --> 5842.469
hello hi Brenda

5839.39 --> 5845.820000000001
[Music]

5842.469 --> 5845.82
how are you doing today

5851.15 --> 5859.969
why are you putting yourself on mute I

5855.95 --> 5864.57
could hear you before ah there it is

5859.969 --> 5868.53
I'm not accustomed to Skype mmm all

5864.57 --> 5872.25
right so how are you doing oh I'm fine

5868.53 --> 5880.889999999999
it's arm7

5872.25 --> 5883.68
7:30 a.m. here right so there was it

5880.89 --> 5887.88
yeah no no just saying that's still kind

5883.68 --> 5889.4400000000005
of early yeah I get up or I've been up

5887.88 --> 5892.35
I've been up for half an hour already

5889.44 --> 5896.549999999999
no hey I got aiming for one and a half

5892.35 --> 5899.67
so been going for a while most very

5896.55 --> 5903.9890000000005
early today with my show so what's there

5899.67 --> 5906.36
anything you wanted to talk about um did

5903.989 --> 5908.5199999999995
you see since Anthony's on I don't know

5906.36 --> 5911.82
if he'll join in now but sorry it wasn't

5908.52 --> 5914.76
taped up Anthony is he's still here but

5911.82 --> 5917.099999999999
he's on the phone call right now he said

5914.76 --> 5923.37
he'd be back in Welch should be like two

5917.1 --> 5925.219
minutes now so no I was um I was curious

5923.37 --> 5930.21
if he had seen fight the flat-earthers

5925.219 --> 5933.81
takedown of his um egg video and I think

5930.21 --> 5937.86
Anthony Reilly the egg man no he stole

5933.81 --> 5941.580000000001
mine he stole my meme did he he's the

5937.86 --> 5945.71
egg man at Google Gujju yeah the egg man

5941.58 --> 5954.0199999999995
I know remember yeah yes I'm a dad

5945.71 --> 5956.1
so he stole my my joke all right so I

5954.02 --> 5959.9890000000005
wasn't about to leave it

5956.1 --> 5959.9890000000005
oh that's fine

5960.9 --> 5966.21
say I don't know why are you man why are

5963.73 --> 5969.759999999999
you why are you yes I remember the song

5966.21 --> 5971.62
why are you called the egg man yeah

5969.76 --> 5974.530000000001
because he's always talking about the

5971.62 --> 5976.48
eggs it's like his main focus he doesn't

5974.53 --> 5979.2
use other examples even though he's just

5976.48 --> 5979.2
song about the eggs

5980.4 --> 5988.03
so does Anthony so you understand that

5985.83 --> 5995.83
parts-per-million is not the same as

5988.03 --> 5997.929999999999
density no it's a solution system yet

5995.83 --> 6002.61
parts per million is yes how many things

5997.93 --> 6004.950000000001
are mixed in right that's not density no

6002.61 --> 6008.21
but when you mix things in with heavier

6004.95 --> 6012.2699999999995
that have a heavier density with

6008.21 --> 6016.32
substances that have a lighter density

6012.27 --> 6021.870000000001
and they mix they dissolve then that

6016.32 --> 6025.74
does add up yes it has up yeah so it

6021.87 --> 6030.15
changes the density it changes explicity

6025.74 --> 6032.37
of the entire substance yes but a meter

6030.15 --> 6037.95
that measures parts per million isn't

6032.37 --> 6040.23
measuring density you need a you need a

6037.95 --> 6043.139999999999
you need to measure what is called

6040.23 --> 6045.8099999999995
Jessica's entity that's just a quantity

6043.14 --> 6047.9400000000005
system to basically scale up as well

6045.81 --> 6053.9400000000005
it's a measurement measuring system to

6047.94 --> 6057.0
measure up the the average that's all it

6053.94 --> 6061.83
itself as far is a deduction on

6057.0 --> 6063.45
instrument basically but it's not

6061.83 --> 6065.64
involved that's just that's the

6063.45 --> 6066.99
aftermath that's literally the aftermath

6065.64 --> 6069.09
because it did the process the

6066.99 --> 6072.66
scientific process is about actually

6069.09 --> 6074.9400000000005
changing the density of the nesco and

6072.66 --> 6078.78
then you throw in salt any changes the

6074.94 --> 6081.03
density so effectively what happens but

6078.78 --> 6084.0599999999995
you're not measuring it with the device

6081.03 --> 6086.21
that Anthony used the doesn't matter

6084.06 --> 6089.400000000001
doesn't matter with what you measure it

6086.21 --> 6090.699
it is all raw says of the experiment not

6089.4 --> 6095.049999999999
how you measure it

6090.699 --> 6097.509999999999
it kind of matters no it only matters if

6095.05 --> 6099.909000000001
the measurement itself is an independent

6097.51 --> 6101.829000000001
variable but it's not it's the density

6099.909 --> 6103.688999999999
that's the independent variable

6101.829 --> 6106.78
so whatever measurements you do with

6103.689 --> 6109.209000000001
that with that data is not involved in

6106.78 --> 6111.398999999999
the actual scientific method itself it's

6109.209 --> 6114.969
not relative do it hey Brenda tell me

6111.399 --> 6116.889
why it's not acceptable for one thing

6114.969 --> 6119.499
you're not measuring density and the

6116.889 --> 6122.11
density of the water is your independent

6119.499 --> 6124.84
variable in the experiment what do you

6122.11 --> 6126.969
think measure in the printer it's a red

6124.84 --> 6129.249
herring you don't have to measure the

6126.969 --> 6131.949
independent variable it's about changing

6129.249 --> 6133.749
the independent variable well no she's

6131.949 --> 6135.339999999999
got half a point but what does Brenda

6133.749 --> 6137.369
think that she's met what does Brenda

6135.34 --> 6140.889
think that that thing did that meter

6137.369 --> 6144.098999999999
it measures parts per million right so

6140.889 --> 6148.479
what's that a representation of parts

6144.099 --> 6151.03
per million otherwise known as parts per

6148.479 --> 6152.889
million yeah it's all million there are

6151.03 --> 6156.36
in the solution Brenda now how can that

6152.889 --> 6159.729
not be considered a legitimate

6156.36 --> 6161.499
measurement of density well okay sir

6159.729 --> 6163.899
they're not red herring you I know where

6161.499 --> 6166.239
this is going look Anthony what she's

6163.899 --> 6169.9890000000005
trying to suggest is that it doesn't

6166.239 --> 6171.938999999999
change the density of the water because

6169.989 --> 6175.989
if what it does is it changes the

6171.939 --> 6177.969
density of the average medium you know

6175.989 --> 6180.669
I'm just trying to red herring that I

6177.969 --> 6182.289
know but I'd like her to explain what

6180.669 --> 6183.729
she thinks that the difference of that

6182.289 --> 6186.009999999999
10 parts per million after the

6183.729 --> 6187.829000000001
experiment what does she think that that

6186.01 --> 6190.2390000000005
was measuring if it wasn't the density

6187.829 --> 6193.898999999999
its measuring the parts per million

6190.239 --> 6195.549999999999
right so what is that Brenda that's what

6193.899 --> 6198.519
it is parts per million it doesn't

6195.55 --> 6201.039
measure definitely you need parts if the

6198.519 --> 6203.789000000001
parts per million count increases what's

6201.039 --> 6207.579
that telling you I can't think about it

6203.789 --> 6211.449
um that you have increased the amount of

6207.579 --> 6216.449
salt in the solution yes right otherwise

6211.449 --> 6218.949
known as what Brenda parts per million

6216.449 --> 6220.36
so you just won't make the transition

6218.949 --> 6222.428999999999
from parts to parts per million to

6220.36 --> 6224.558999999999
density okay no worries but everybody

6222.429 --> 6226.27
else didn't do it so you don't need to

6224.559 --> 6228.01
that are not the same thing Anthony yeah

6226.27 --> 6229.079000000001
she has a point but it's only a

6228.01 --> 6232.900000000001
technicality

6229.079 --> 6235.0
she's a she's a technique right it's not

6232.9 --> 6237.36
relevant to the method itself it's only

6235.0 --> 6240.039
what you deduce from it

6237.36 --> 6241.78
she doesn't balance she does have a

6240.039 --> 6244.179
point or what's the definition what did

6241.78 --> 6246.849
i I've increased the density of that

6244.179 --> 6248.8
liquid and by doing so put salt in it

6246.849 --> 6251.650000000001
right that's what I put in that salt

6248.8 --> 6254.5
Brenda is adding to the mass of that

6251.65 --> 6257.619
liquid all the mol either either

6254.5 --> 6263.02
definition applies the mass all the mole

6257.619 --> 6267.19
is what brandon mass over moles that

6263.02 --> 6270.070000000001
might be density but you know you need a

6267.19 --> 6274.329
Yugo you need to measure you need a

6270.07 --> 6276.28
simple tool right only a few dollars to

6274.329 --> 6281.59
measure the specific gravity of the

6276.28 --> 6284.53
water that was really just say that yeah

6281.59 --> 6289.2390000000005
it's it's used every day by lots of

6284.53 --> 6294.429
people you want to respond to that

6289.239 --> 6298.829
happening it's it's a hydrometer why

6294.429 --> 6298.829
didn't you use a hydrometer Anthony

6303.75 --> 6312.52
Anthony he's still there I think I

6310.21 --> 6313.9890000000005
scared him away I don't know he's

6312.52 --> 6314.620000000001
probably looking into what you're

6313.989 --> 6318.459999999999
talking about

6314.62 --> 6321.97
a hydrometer it measures

6318.46 --> 6324.85
specific gravity or as you guys say

6321.97 --> 6328.92
relative density relative density and

6324.85 --> 6333.85
specific gravity are the same thing

6328.92 --> 6336.85
sure well look it up yeah that's really

6333.85 --> 6339.97
nice that's really nice wording that

6336.85 --> 6342.67
word in there again but it's just

6339.97 --> 6345.04
another deviation from an original

6342.67 --> 6346.9
concept that's actually proven again

6345.04 --> 6351.31
so if you want to continually tie

6346.9 --> 6353.65
everything you can into this unprovable

6351.31 --> 6355.780000000001
thing called gravity then that's your

6353.65 --> 6358.2699999999995
prerogative that your belief system that

6355.78 --> 6360.19
you're pursuing okay but we'll stick to

6358.27 --> 6363.1900000000005
actually scientifically provable things

6360.19 --> 6366.87
and use those systems if you don't mind

6363.19 --> 6369.879999999999
well I would love to debate Anthony or

6366.87 --> 6374.47
yourself or anybody on the Flat Earth

6369.88 --> 6377.46
about gravity there is a yep there's a

6374.47 --> 6380.83
youtube channel called modern debates

6377.46 --> 6387.01
he's very good he's very fair and

6380.83 --> 6391.989
neutral right so I would debate Anthony

6387.01 --> 6394.93
or Nathan or anybody else on any subject

6391.989 --> 6398.95
within the Flat Earth on the YouTube

6394.93 --> 6401.2300000000005
channel called modern debates you can

6398.95 --> 6404.11
google it they usually have atheists and

6401.23 --> 6408.459999999999
theists creation/evolution and all those

6404.11 --> 6410.2
things but and he's very fair towards

6408.46 --> 6412.51
both sides

6410.2 --> 6416.17
I'll take he's not biased I'll take you

6412.51 --> 6419.71
is not it he's not biased like I find I

6416.17 --> 6421.54
think I get I get your your gist yeah

6419.71 --> 6425.77
you know like Steve Steve McRae's

6421.54 --> 6430.09
channel or what's his name um anyway a

6425.77 --> 6432.39
non sequitur I think can be biased right

6430.09 --> 6435.67
he can be

6432.39 --> 6437.14
certainly watch the options but anyway

6435.67 --> 6440.17
sure I think you up on it

6437.14 --> 6442.96
fine I'm not I can't speak for a Riley

6440.17 --> 6446.41
or Nathan but I'll do it fine yeah

6442.96 --> 6450.46
aren't afraid to debate anyone okay

6446.41 --> 6453.07
anyone all right has to be an actual

6450.46 --> 6454.33
debate yeah

6453.07 --> 6457.92
that's what they have you have an

6454.33 --> 6460.48
opening statement on both sides and then

6457.92 --> 6463.17
discussion period of questions and and

6460.48 --> 6465.849999999999
then they take questions from the chat

6463.17 --> 6469.54
yeah yeah I'd be most fun I've done that

6465.85 --> 6473.02
before it though by D strict format

6469.54 --> 6475.24
there's not always a guaranteed result

6473.02 --> 6477.790000000001
especially if people start politicizing

6475.24 --> 6480.07
and going on red-herring tangents but

6477.79 --> 6481.78
yeah they will see wherever it goes fine

6480.07 --> 6484.389999999999
I'll do it no problem

6481.78 --> 6487.09
I think I think that that format where

6484.39 --> 6490.54
you have a strict opening statement from

6487.09 --> 6493.12
both sides back and forth at with a

6490.54 --> 6495.97
moderator would be good for for Flat

6493.12 --> 6498.28
Earth because it eliminates it

6495.97 --> 6501.52
eliminates the personality factor

6498.28 --> 6503.92
because you're just not allowed to get

6501.52 --> 6507.9400000000005
into personal attacks that would not be

6503.92 --> 6509.4400000000005
a that would not not be acceptable and I

6507.94 --> 6512.0199999999995
think that that would be good because we

6509.44 --> 6516.61
could hear hear out because what I see

6512.02 --> 6518.650000000001
now is people dividing up into into

6516.61 --> 6520.839999999999
camps and not talking to each other and

6518.65 --> 6524.92
I think people should really not talking

6520.84 --> 6527.26
to each other really yeah you know yeah

6524.92 --> 6530.2
no they all talk to one another red

6527.26 --> 6531.88
light and everyone pays attention to

6530.2 --> 6533.38
Nair everyone else does do you think

6531.88 --> 6537.1900000000005
that like everything that happens on

6533.38 --> 6538.99
discredit is just anonymous really well

6537.19 --> 6541.24
I don't know about this body's gossiping

6538.99 --> 6543.01
the [ __ ] out of everything I'm not

6541.24 --> 6546.7
talking right into occupations of this

6543.01 --> 6549.400000000001
entire social media stuff I'm talking

6546.7 --> 6551.62
about talking between flat earther and

6549.4 --> 6555.099999999999
globe earth yeah that's what I'm talking

6551.62 --> 6556.599999999999
about - well I don't see a lot of

6555.1 --> 6558.97
everybody keeps usurps on the other

6556.6 --> 6562.33
other group and there's just people

6558.97 --> 6564.4890000000005
interacting even like bartering at that

6562.33 --> 6567.219
with the other side

6564.489 --> 6568.749
I don't see I don't see much I don't see

6567.219 --> 6571.749
much discussion back and forth yes

6568.749 --> 6573.4
you're right that people produced videos

6571.749 --> 6575.469
correct criticizing one side or the

6573.4 --> 6578.018999999999
other but they don't sit down and talk

6575.469 --> 6581.05
together and work it out yeah why do you

6578.019 --> 6584.349
think that is because people go nuts

6581.05 --> 6586.709
like either yeah you globo's go nuts and

6584.349 --> 6591.34
go on the direct Oh retardation

6586.709 --> 6591.909
arrogance allergy exposition hold on I'm

6591.34 --> 6596.229
not done yet

6591.909 --> 6599.17
or yeah we flirt earthers get impatient

6596.229 --> 6601.4490000000005
with your constant ignorance literally

6599.17 --> 6603.88
intentional ignorance in not hearing the

6601.449 --> 6606.369
arguments and completely bypassing it

6603.88 --> 6608.349
and like nothing else you don't you

6606.369 --> 6611.469
don't hear the arguments you come you

6608.349 --> 6613.059
just wait and after a certain point you

6611.469 --> 6615.159
think you're hearing the same argument

6613.059 --> 6616.860000000001
again and you just ignore it but you

6615.159 --> 6619.478999999999
don't listen to it you don't actually

6616.86 --> 6622.929
understand what it's set for some reason

6619.479 --> 6624.909000000001
or it's not getting through every time

6622.929 --> 6627.729
and that effect is what makes

6624.909 --> 6631.839999999999
flat-earthers get so pissed off is the

6627.729 --> 6634.539000000001
the blatant obvious amnesia literally

6631.84 --> 6636.189
taking place in plain sight every time

6634.539 --> 6639.849
that is the thing that annoys the [ __ ]

6636.189 --> 6642.579000000001
out of us so yeah that can happen and

6639.849 --> 6645.34
it's something we all have to deal with

6642.579 --> 6647.17
and everybody's going through a process

6645.34 --> 6649.809
of their own and some people make

6647.17 --> 6652.78
certain choices and they make a trope

6649.809 --> 6655.269
out of it and it kind of draws a certain

6652.78 --> 6657.039
crowd and yeah that's what's going on

6655.269 --> 6659.650000000001
that's how it works and you can't just

6657.039 --> 6663.188999999999
say like oh we should not do this or

6659.65 --> 6666.848999999999
that it's people are gonna do what they

6663.189 --> 6671.229
do and you can't just force them all to

6666.849 --> 6673.269
just not get passionate or allergic

6671.229 --> 6676.389
about things anymore you can just work

6673.269 --> 6679.150000000001
it out and actually take responsibility

6676.389 --> 6681.099
for yourself as an individual in dealing

6679.15 --> 6684.249
with all these issues whether they be in

6681.099 --> 6687.6990000000005
you or in people that are involving

6684.249 --> 6690.188999999999
themselves with you and so my message

6687.699 --> 6694.839999999999
overalls like grow the [ __ ] up everyone

6690.189 --> 6697.719
please let's move on I agree that I

6694.84 --> 6701.610000000001
agree that getting upset getting purse

6697.719 --> 6706.27
and calling each side the retards and

6701.61 --> 6709.15
Glover's do do that they do use names do

6706.27 --> 6712.81
it too and it's besides have [ __ ]

6709.15 --> 6714.639999999999
elements that is not help there now of

6712.81 --> 6716.650000000001
course it's not no root tell me when

6714.64 --> 6720.910000000001
retardation is helpful except when

6716.65 --> 6724.78
you're a slave maybe so call your weight

6720.91 --> 6727.15
but calling calling people quote/unquote

6724.78 --> 6729.429999999999
retards is not helpful and that's why I

6727.15 --> 6731.889999999999
would like to see change and I thought

6729.43 --> 6734.89
that maybe by using this other debate

6731.89 --> 6736.900000000001
site that that would be helpful sure I

6734.89 --> 6739.06
would really know it really love hard it

6736.9 --> 6742.78
they will be called out that's just how

6739.06 --> 6745.660000000001
it works sometimes it just fits this

6742.78 --> 6748.15
situation and it doesn't mean that then

6745.66 --> 6750.43
everything is like that but when

6748.15 --> 6753.07
somebody is literally being [ __ ]

6750.43 --> 6755.110000000001
they are being [ __ ] and has symptoms

6753.07 --> 6758.11
and those symptoms can be pointed axe

6755.11 --> 6761.5599999999995
that's what makes it [ __ ] it's not

6758.11 --> 6763.42
just just a random accusation just like

6761.56 --> 6765.400000000001
a [ __ ] you or something we're saying no

6763.42 --> 6768.82
the retardation is definitely grounded

6765.4 --> 6773.0199999999995
in empirical data as it were in the

6768.82 --> 6774.849999999999
behavior so but yeah people do abuse it

6773.02 --> 6778.719
on the flatter side people do kind of

6774.85 --> 6780.6990000000005
take it as a trope just like what a lot

6778.719 --> 6785.64
of globo's do it glow burs do it a lot

6780.699 --> 6785.639999999999
more and they really thrive in it so

6786.5 --> 6790.89
but it's going to be happened people are

6788.73 --> 6794.73
people people have opinions and passions

6790.89 --> 6796.89
and they collide and they're gonna look

6794.73 --> 6805.889999999999
for weaknesses in the other and then try

6796.89 --> 6809.13
to break them down okay yeah but even if

6805.89 --> 6810.92
you feel that the other is justified and

6809.13 --> 6815.1900000000005
calling the other person [ __ ] or

6810.92 --> 6819.15
stupid or ignorant it isn't helpful in

6815.19 --> 6821.489
advancing a debate to do that even know

6819.15 --> 6826.58
it's never it really depends it depends

6821.489 --> 6829.409
on what you are trying to highlight and

6826.58 --> 6831.8099999999995
does what Nathan does with his brutality

6829.409 --> 6834.929
is verbal brutality which it kind of is

6831.81 --> 6837.54
at times it's really pissed off or he's

6834.929 --> 6840.78
really in an agitated mood then he's

6837.54 --> 6843.57
just literally showing the psychological

6840.78 --> 6847.5599999999995
effects of how people start to respond

6843.57 --> 6850.799999999999
under pressure and how Joel up their

6847.56 --> 6853.89
whole belief system really is he's just

6850.8 --> 6855.860000000001
maybe feel it is because I'm sure is

6853.89 --> 6858.63
when you really show your principles

6855.86 --> 6861.989
it's just yeah honor there's the flat

6858.63 --> 6864.42
earthers are put under severe severe

6861.989 --> 6866.549999999999
peer pressure like nothing else out

6864.42 --> 6869.88
there in the world by Globus when they

6866.55 --> 6872.55
get the chance okay it happens a lot and

6869.88 --> 6875.159000000001
we are what we get pissed off sometimes

6872.55 --> 6877.17
when we feel we're getting too bullied

6875.159 --> 6879.719
and that happens on your side as well

6877.17 --> 6883.17
but a flat earthers on an average are a

6879.719 --> 6885.51
lot better at taking just taking blows

6883.17 --> 6887.9400000000005
because we know we expect that to happen

6885.51 --> 6890.37
we know knew that was gonna happen

6887.94 --> 6893.75
when we when we go public with Flat

6890.37 --> 6897.9
Earth so it's different with the globus

6893.75 --> 6900.6
you guys most of you get a lot nuttier

6897.9 --> 6902.58
and a lot more cognitively dissonant

6900.6 --> 6905.13
with your own insights and your own

6902.58 --> 6908.04
knowledge and how you view that when you

6905.13 --> 6909.89
are put under pressure that do rarely

6908.04 --> 6912.659
really happens with the flat-earthers

6909.89 --> 6914.58
you try to trick us constantly in

6912.659 --> 6916.71
suggesting like oh you haven't fixed

6914.58 --> 6918.87
this your motto or how does that work on

6916.71 --> 6919.949
your you try to trick us but that's

6918.87 --> 6923.94
really not our issue

6919.949 --> 6927.239
you we don't find those things a problem

6923.94 --> 6931.44
it's not working it doesn't make us

6927.239 --> 6933.178999999999
insecure we don't we are not feeble in

6931.44 --> 6935.999
our approach of it because we don't

6933.179 --> 6939.3
assume so much or at least most of us

6935.999 --> 6940.709
don't we recognize there's a lot we

6939.3 --> 6942.959
don't know and that there is a mystery

6940.709 --> 6945.84
in it we don't presuppose so much

6942.959 --> 6949.26
there's not so much there for us that to

6945.84 --> 6951.3
to tests to test our nerves on when it

6949.26 --> 6953.519
gets tested like we do with Globus that

6951.3 --> 6958.969
have to presuppose so much you really do

6953.519 --> 6962.34
it's part of it I agree with that or not

6958.969 --> 6964.86
I'm sure it must be difficult to come

6962.34 --> 6968.13
out as a flat earther yeah

6964.86 --> 6972.299999999999
in today's society because the rest of

6968.13 --> 6978.26
society is going to be very critical of

6972.3 --> 6981.809
that right well more than just critical

6978.26 --> 6985.7390000000005
well I don't know out right I don't know

6981.809 --> 6990.059
why I went and ridiculing I don't know

6985.739 --> 6992.098999999999
why I'm updating rights they're outright

6990.059 --> 6995.01
peer pressure and ridiculing is nots

6992.099 --> 6996.78
criticism to be fair right well I don't

6995.01 --> 7000.38
know what I have no idea what it's like

6996.78 --> 7002.869
oh it is like you're gonna not just be

7000.38 --> 7004.4890000000005
honest about that it's come on well I'm

7002.869 --> 7006.228999999999
not a flat earther so how would I know

7004.489 --> 7007.879999999999
what it's like well you would recognize

7006.229 --> 7010.01
it like every time it's mentioned

7007.88 --> 7012.26
somewhere it's usually and especially

7010.01 --> 7016.400000000001
the mainstream it's part of the ridicule

7012.26 --> 7018.8
it's a designation of idiocy they don't

7016.4 --> 7021.018999999999
talk about it the neutral thing about it

7018.8 --> 7023.749
they don't even talk about the the

7021.019 --> 7026.539000000001
inline information and they even latch

7023.749 --> 7028.639
on to still the archaic principles that

7026.539 --> 7031.009999999999
no flat earther ever believes like the

7028.639 --> 7033.829
earther of the earth falling off it that

7031.01 --> 7037.34
kind of [ __ ] they still do that and

7033.829 --> 7039.829
it's been decades they absolutely know

7037.34 --> 7042.619000000001
this their information gatherers that

7039.829 --> 7045.139
scour the internet for information they

7042.619 --> 7047.659
know these arguments and they don't use

7045.139 --> 7050.42
them they stick to the old-fashioned

7047.659 --> 7052.28
[ __ ] that everybody knows is not real

7050.42 --> 7053.389
except for the people that really really

7052.28 --> 7055.369
haven't looked

7053.389 --> 7058.039
the flat earth and they do this on

7055.369 --> 7060.499
purpose so the ridicule is there there

7058.039 --> 7062.709
is no neutral approach to Flat Earth in

7060.499 --> 7065.57
the mainstream absolutely not

7062.709 --> 7069.919
well no they should not criticism it is

7065.57 --> 7072.049999999999
outright ridicule and slander I don't

7069.919 --> 7075.739
think they that the media in general

7072.05 --> 7077.899
hardly even knows you exist no it's not

7075.739 --> 7079.518999999999
about the individuals I'm not talking

7077.899 --> 7083.179
about individuals I'm talking about

7079.519 --> 7085.579000000001
flat-earthers as a designation as I

7083.179 --> 7087.9490000000005
don't think it's I don't think as a

7085.579 --> 7090.228999999999
subject it's brought up very much there

7087.949 --> 7093.018999999999
was the one documentary time to time it

7090.229 --> 7096.05
is especially if they shouldn't work it

7093.019 --> 7097.909000000001
in as a joke ridiculing it or if they

7096.05 --> 7100.159000000001
can subtly Bream's oh look we can

7097.909 --> 7102.739
disprove something like oh look this the

7100.159 --> 7106.699
Mirage of Chicago or bending around the

7102.739 --> 7109.879999999999
earth that they do do that [ __ ] they do

7106.699 --> 7112.219
a blower episode that episode runner

7109.88 --> 7116.349
does mainstream that episode appeared on

7112.219 --> 7118.999
mainstream media years ago though I know

7116.349 --> 7121.3
yeah so it doesn't seem to me to be as

7118.999 --> 7124.699
often as you think I think you feel

7121.3 --> 7125.659000000001
challenged no I had no recipes often and

7124.699 --> 7128.839999999999
I didn't say that

7125.659 --> 7131.32
yeah I think it's you would feel

7128.84 --> 7135.169
challenged by the representations of

7131.32 --> 7137.36
space and and the earth in in movies and

7135.169 --> 7139.969
and no TV shows and stuff like that

7137.36 --> 7142.339999999999
don't feel challenged by that at all I I

7139.969 --> 7146.57
could pretty much be a designer of that

7142.34 --> 7149.63
[ __ ] in stories how do you feel about I

7146.57 --> 7151.28
have done that how do you feel about the

7149.63 --> 7154.599
announcement that we're going to have a

7151.28 --> 7157.61
base on the moon I think it's hilarious

7154.599 --> 7159.409000000001
I'm curious to see what they're gonna

7157.61 --> 7161.449
manifest how much effort they actually

7159.409 --> 7164.089999999999
gonna take or if they're just gonna

7161.449 --> 7166.728999999999
leave it like a media narrative and not

7164.09 --> 7169.55
really follow up on it I don't know no I

7166.729 --> 7172.01
think that people are gonna go to and

7169.55 --> 7174.619000000001
from the base on a regular basis sure

7172.01 --> 7177.860000000001
they're gonna be well figure it out when

7174.619 --> 7180.259999999999
it happens Rinna and people are gonna go

7177.86 --> 7182.839999999999
to and from space on a regular that's

7180.26 --> 7184.030000000001
gonna be regular tourist trips into

7182.84 --> 7186.9800000000005
space

7184.03 --> 7188.9
fascinating I wonder what all that extra

7186.98 --> 7191.36
matter being placed on the moon is gonna

7188.9 --> 7193.28
cause where they're gonna place it if it

7191.36 --> 7196.489
is going to be visible and if it's gonna

7193.28 --> 7199.48
bring the gravity of the moon out of

7196.489 --> 7203.089999999999
balance causing it to suddenly from a

7199.48 --> 7205.849999999999
eternal standstill points rotate the

7203.09 --> 7208.01
moon because of the shift of weight that

7205.85 --> 7209.84
has been put on it and maybe all the

7208.01 --> 7211.66
extra pushing off it with rockets and

7209.84 --> 7214.7300000000005
everything so I wonder what will happen

7211.66 --> 7216.29
very curious you don't think that that's

7214.73 --> 7220.3099999999995
an actual possibility you're being

7216.29 --> 7222.71
sarcastic right I know I don't actually

7220.31 --> 7225.35
think there is a possibility that people

7222.71 --> 7228.68
can build moon bases because the moon is

7225.35 --> 7232.21
not a physical object you're right no I

7228.68 --> 7234.68
met Brenda can I actually what you meant

7232.21 --> 7236.39
you know this moon idea you know that

7234.68 --> 7238.64
Trump said they've got five years to get

7236.39 --> 7240.650000000001
to the moon do you think that it's

7238.64 --> 7241.76
possible no I'm not asking for your

7240.65 --> 7243.679999999999
opinion but do you think that it's

7241.76 --> 7245.3
possible that he might be literally

7243.68 --> 7251.51
calling NASA out to make them prove

7245.3 --> 7256.570000000001
their [ __ ] no I don't interesting no

7251.51 --> 7259.64
I think that he just wants a positive

7256.57 --> 7262.67
win in the public that's how politicians

7259.64 --> 7263.54
think is they want positive news about

7262.67 --> 7267.05
them in the media

7263.54 --> 7268.73
that's how politicians think so and if

7267.05 --> 7270.38
he calls them out the way I'll stone all

7268.73 --> 7271.94
the way he seems to have done and they

7270.38 --> 7274.25
don't get to the moon within five years

7271.94 --> 7275.299999999999
and Trump's told them to get it done how

7274.25 --> 7277.19
does that make you look how does that

7275.3 --> 7281.33
make NASA look from the book from the

7277.19 --> 7282.739
ball earth is perspective I don't think

7281.33 --> 7285.59
we'll see when that comes I don't think

7282.739 --> 7288.259999999999
it'll be difficult it just a met it's

7285.59 --> 7290.3
just a photo so he went so when Don

7288.26 --> 7291.95
Pettit says we'd love to go back to the

7290.3 --> 7294.26
moon but we don't have the technology

7291.95 --> 7295.489
you think that they'll do it they don't

7294.26 --> 7298.43
have to technology according to Don

7295.489 --> 7302.2699999999995
Pettit yeah we just have to rebuild the

7298.43 --> 7304.34
infrastructure well you know what get on

7302.27 --> 7306.14
it look right I've my own theory about

7304.34 --> 7309.53
it if they really want a more serious

7306.14 --> 7311.900000000001
moon landing event that's not so feeble

7309.53 --> 7315.17
looking like in the 60s they're gonna

7311.9 --> 7317.239
need a really good movie director even

7315.17 --> 7320.159
yeah so I wonder who they're gonna go

7317.239 --> 7322.44
with I'm actually going for Michael Bay

7320.159 --> 7325.62
I think they're gonna use Michael Bay to

7322.44 --> 7329.19
make the moon landing look really really

7325.62 --> 7330.75
awesome so so the reason that that guy

7329.19 --> 7332.82
said that we could didn't have the

7330.75 --> 7334.77
technology is we didn't have the

7332.82 --> 7337.32
monitoring station set up around the

7334.77 --> 7339.27
room and the CGI wasn't it went barely

7337.32 --> 7340.71
there the CGI was very hard to trick

7339.27 --> 7343.56
they had to basically trick everything

7340.71 --> 7346.62
manual back then so yeah there's so much

7343.56 --> 7348.2390000000005
more capabilities now at the trick it's

7346.62 --> 7351.48
awesome so you're saying it would be

7348.239 --> 7352.739
easier yeah easier to fake much is that

7351.48 --> 7358.5
why he said we didn't have the

7352.739 --> 7359.638999999999
technology what sorry well then why

7358.5 --> 7362.52
would he say we didn't have the

7359.639 --> 7367.7390000000005
technology if it was even if it was

7362.52 --> 7369.9490000000005
easier why didn't they have to what

7367.739 --> 7373.65
would I don't understand your question

7369.949 --> 7375.54
when the NASA representative said we

7373.65 --> 7378.2699999999995
didn't have the technology to go back

7375.54 --> 7381.449
but you are saying it would actually be

7378.27 --> 7383.46
easier to fake it since they faked it

7381.449 --> 7385.0199999999995
the first time why would he say we

7383.46 --> 7388.02
didn't have the technology we actually

7385.02 --> 7389.659000000001
have better technology now trying to

7388.02 --> 7393.26
listen in this day because they're not

7389.659 --> 7396.21
saying and that they're tricking it

7393.26 --> 7398.1900000000005
that's what I'm saying they're saying oh

7396.21 --> 7400.34
it's actual technology to actually

7398.19 --> 7402.799999999999
physically go there it's just their

7400.34 --> 7405.87
narrative it is their output is their

7402.8 --> 7409.650000000001
party decision their priesthood decision

7405.87 --> 7413.58
to give that as a response so i Anthony

7409.65 --> 7415.98
Riley do you want a debate on our modern

7413.58 --> 7418.44
debate YouTube channel you'd be sleeping

7415.98 --> 7420.0
worried to you Brenda I'm not really a

7418.44 --> 7421.469
debate I don't know what you could bring

7420.0 --> 7423.659
to the table evidence wise I've never

7421.469 --> 7425.61
seen you bring any evidence ever to

7423.659 --> 7427.44
support any of the assertions I hear you

7425.61 --> 7429.87
make frequently so how could there be a

7427.44 --> 7434.5199999999995
debate well you have a debate with

7429.87 --> 7436.17
arguments no evidence it's not what you

7434.52 --> 7438.929
can argue is what you can demonstrate to

7436.17 --> 7443.58
be true well that's what a debate is as

7438.929 --> 7446.55
arguments evidence Brenda that's not a

7443.58 --> 7448.26
debate that would be an experiment no

7446.55 --> 7450.179
you trying to argue points that you

7448.26 --> 7451.92
believe true and you provide evidence to

7450.179 --> 7453.719
furnish those arguments and I've never

7451.92 --> 7455.67
seen you present anything other than

7453.719 --> 7457.83
rhetoric so I'm not that interested in

7455.67 --> 7459.09
talking to you about rhetoric I would be

7457.83 --> 7460.469
interested in talking tea if you could

7459.09 --> 7462.6
bring some evidence to support your

7460.469 --> 7463.89
assertions could you bring some evidence

7462.6 --> 7467.219
to support some of the things that you

7463.89 --> 7470.52
say yes I can cite evidence that is

7467.219 --> 7472.44
widely available but actually presents

7470.52 --> 7473.64
it so we can see it right so we know

7472.44 --> 7476.91
what you're talking about and you're not

7473.64 --> 7479.85
just presenting rhetoric you mean video

7476.91 --> 7481.5
and then if you found a document or you

7479.85 --> 7483.27
find a newspaper article or you find

7481.5 --> 7485.91
something to support and a surgeon ie

7483.27 --> 7488.64
that you make then that helps but just a

7485.91 --> 7490.11
debate stuff it was futile I want to see

7488.64 --> 7494.37
what you can prove not what you can

7490.11 --> 7497.46
preach arguments aren't preaching

7494.37 --> 7502.8
arguments are proving things no they're

7497.46 --> 7504.18
not Brenda sure they are so in that case

7502.8 --> 7505.59
the answer to your question is I'm not

7504.18 --> 7508.2300000000005
really interested Brenda but thank you

7505.59 --> 7511.62
very much well I actually wanted to be a

7508.23 --> 7515.429999999999
lawyer no I left that industry ten years

7511.62 --> 7519.0
ago more I thought you had gone back to

7515.43 --> 7520.5
school yeah that doesn't mean I want to

7519.0 --> 7522.42
be a lawyer it just means I want to

7520.5 --> 7524.4
infiltrate the education system with the

7522.42 --> 7527.01
paper but there's gonna destroy the idea

7524.4 --> 7529.799999999999
that you guys are some kind of self

7527.01 --> 7531.780000000001
regulated scientific community that has

7529.8 --> 7533.64
no legal ramifications for

7531.78 --> 7535.53
indoctrinating people with [ __ ]

7533.64 --> 7537.87
rhetoric without any evidence to support

7535.53 --> 7540.0599999999995
it to be true yes so what are your plans

7537.87 --> 7542.43
how do you plan to go about doing that

7540.06 --> 7544.59
as one person is one person you're not

7542.43 --> 7546.51
gonna make a whole lot of difference so

7544.59 --> 7548.28
long as I can if I can raise awareness a

7546.51 --> 7550.14
little bit just a little bit to people

7548.28 --> 7551.849999999999
that are in in the legal industry your

7550.14 --> 7553.9800000000005
perfection that there might be somewhat

7551.85 --> 7555.96
worth looking I hear that's really

7553.98 --> 7557.5199999999995
valuable because otherwise these people

7555.96 --> 7559.29
are asleep people will generally think

7557.52 --> 7560.31
why is this guy doing dedicating his

7559.29 --> 7562.35
time to this she sounds like a

7560.31 --> 7564.21
conspiracy but then when they realize oh

7562.35 --> 7565.9800000000005
actually can't be if he's on a masters

7564.21 --> 7567.9
he's obviously being through the system

7565.98 --> 7569.58
they'll be interested in reading it

7567.9 --> 7571.799999999999
they'll read the first few paragraphs in

7569.58 --> 7572.969
the go hmm maybe there is some ear and

7571.8 --> 7574.26
then they'll either put it down because

7572.969 --> 7577.83
the caveats reading it cause it's too

7574.26 --> 7579.54
too detailed or even if just 1% carry on

7577.83 --> 7579.989
reading then think yeah I hadn't thought

7579.54 --> 7582.15
of that

7579.989 --> 7584.389999999999
that's the intention just to crisp so a

7582.15 --> 7586.65
see plan to see that's all this about

7584.39 --> 7587.37
well in doing that don't you think would

7586.65 --> 7589.29
be helpful

7587.37 --> 7591.54
use a hydrometer to measure specific

7589.29 --> 7594.21
gravity instead of measuring parts per

7591.54 --> 7595.5
million no why would I measure specific

7594.21 --> 7597.15
gravity when the gravity doesn't

7595.5 --> 7599.31
actually exist and it's an affirming the

7597.15 --> 7602.219999999999
consequent doesn't really matter it

7599.31 --> 7604.68
doesn't matter how you measure it only

7602.22 --> 7607.14
thing to do experiment that matters is

7604.68 --> 7610.320000000001
that you actually vary the independent

7607.14 --> 7613.71
variable and you do so it's not relevant

7610.32 --> 7615.599999999999
whatever deduction device or whatever

7613.71 --> 7618.78
you're going to use with that data of

7615.6 --> 7620.22
the experiment it's not relevant well if

7618.78 --> 7621.719999999999
you're measuring tena but if you're

7620.22 --> 7623.570000000001
measuring temperature you need to use a

7621.72 --> 7624.900000000001
thermometer if you're measuring

7623.57 --> 7628.65
us-specific

7624.9 --> 7632.219999999999
yes that's only after math that is how

7628.65 --> 7634.79
you figure out if you're doing it but

7632.22 --> 7637.77
then what it is about is actually

7634.79 --> 7640.26
changing the independent variable and it

7637.77 --> 7642.63
is done it is not relevant that's right

7640.26 --> 7644.88
but Brenda let me just clarify I wasn't

7642.63 --> 7646.59
measuring the density was I I was

7644.88 --> 7648.24
measuring the difference between what I

7646.59 --> 7650.31
did compared to what I did what I did

7648.24 --> 7652.5599999999995
before I did it so I'm measuring the

7650.31 --> 7655.47
relative density and for that I saw a

7652.56 --> 7657.870000000001
hydrometer relative density is another

7655.47 --> 7661.62
name for specific gravity you were

7657.87 --> 7665.58
measuring [ __ ] it's not it's not run

7661.62 --> 7667.29
that you wrongly thing is she's trying

7665.58 --> 7669.24
to say that I need accuracy and I'm

7667.29 --> 7671.46
saying I don't need the accuracy I need

7669.24 --> 7673.59
the relative disparity between what I

7671.46 --> 7675.51
did compared to what it was before I did

7673.59 --> 7678.57
it that's all I need relative difference

7675.51 --> 7681.6900000000005
you were just measuring the buoyancy of

7678.57 --> 7683.429999999999
the egg in a salt solution measuring the

7681.69 --> 7685.889999999999
buoyancy of the egg what are you talking

7683.43 --> 7689.01
little way to join sea of egg appear in

7685.89 --> 7691.610000000001
the past per million counter well it

7689.01 --> 7694.2
does it because it doesn't measure that

7691.61 --> 7698.13
parts per million Brenda not buoyancy

7694.2 --> 7701.67
yeah okay that's it it doesn't measure

7698.13 --> 7704.31
density Anthony if you know Rhonda

7701.67 --> 7705.9
you're not measuring the relative is

7704.31 --> 7708.360000000001
measuring the relative disparity between

7705.9 --> 7709.83
the two positions Priya prior support in

7708.36 --> 7711.54
the assault in and after putting the

7709.83 --> 7713.28
salt in they don't need to be precise

7711.54 --> 7715.7699999999995
they just need to be relative and that's

7713.28 --> 7717.45
what it demonstrated admirably you don't

7715.77 --> 7718.950000000001
get it I get that but that doesn't

7717.45 --> 7720.33
disparity doesn't doesn't change the

7718.95 --> 7721.09
fact that it did what the job I needed

7720.33 --> 7725.92
it to do

7721.09 --> 7727.96
was full yeah yeah if I accept for the

7725.92 --> 7731.86
sake of argument that yes you did change

7727.96 --> 7732.25
the density of the water by adding salt

7731.86 --> 7734.848999999999
to it

7732.25 --> 7738.67
you made a relative the relative density

7734.849 --> 7740.56
relative to what it was before relative

7738.67 --> 7743.909
to water that's what it means relative

7740.56 --> 7748.179
density means relative is typically used

7743.909 --> 7750.73
in reference to pure purified water

7748.179 --> 7752.77
relative to the medium that is what it

7750.73 --> 7754.388999999999
is right yeah no in this case is

7752.77 --> 7755.650000000001
relative to what it was like before I

7754.389 --> 7758.11
put the salt in Brenda

7755.65 --> 7759.73
so there's relativity with regards to

7758.11 --> 7762.098999999999
add in the salt and there's also

7759.73 --> 7764.29
relativity in regards to what the salt

7762.099 --> 7766.3
did relative to the egg so there's two

7764.29 --> 7768.19
relative things there and I manipulated

7766.3 --> 7769.900000000001
one of them and because I did that

7768.19 --> 7771.638999999999
independent and the scientific method

7769.9 --> 7772.989
says that independent variables are the

7771.639 --> 7775.389
things that the observer or the

7772.989 --> 7776.5
experimenter deliberately manipulates to

7775.389 --> 7780.04
try and establish a cause-and-effect

7776.5 --> 7782.949
relationship that's what I did yeah you

7780.04 --> 7786.61
you altered the density of the water and

7782.949 --> 7788.049999999999
changed the buoyancy of the egg I didn't

7786.61 --> 7792.61
change the buoyancy that wasn't the

7788.05 --> 7794.2300000000005
independent variable Brenda you altered

7792.61 --> 7796.389
the in the middle Maryville was there

7794.23 --> 7799.089999999999
the density of the water you did alter

7796.389 --> 7801.1900000000005
its density by adding more so to about

7799.09 --> 7802.78
that that's the presumed cause and then

7801.19 --> 7803.638999999999
when it does what it does that then

7802.78 --> 7805.869
becomes the cause-and-effect

7803.639 --> 7808.36
relationship established and you accept

7805.869 --> 7812.08
your hypothesis and reject you know so

7808.36 --> 7815.71
you you um you altered its density and

7812.08 --> 7817.75
changed the buoyancy of the egg no I

7815.71 --> 7820.32
didn't change the velocity of the egg

7817.75 --> 7823.42
I changed the density of the solution

7820.32 --> 7825.849
right this is all Theresa points he's

7823.42 --> 7827.7390000000005
only a side effect correct you're

7825.849 --> 7829.27
presupposing a side effect right that

7827.739 --> 7830.348999999999
falls outside a scientific method

7829.27 --> 7832.09
because you're not allowed to do that

7830.349 --> 7833.860000000001
within scientific method if you want to

7832.09 --> 7835.54
preach it outside a scientific method

7833.86 --> 7839.339999999999
you can do but just be aware that

7835.54 --> 7839.34
pseudoscience it's up to you

7842.5 --> 7848.45
so the buoyancy of the egg remained the

7845.39 --> 7851.450000000001
same I don't know it didn't change it we

7848.45 --> 7857.99
were control wasn't it you didn't change

7851.45 --> 7860.0
it correct huh the dancer fear of the

7857.99 --> 7861.92
egg did not change but the density of

7860.0 --> 7865.25
the medium the egg is indeed change

7861.92 --> 7867.4400000000005
that's our approach yeah there's only

7865.25 --> 7870.14
one independent variable Brenda and it

7867.44 --> 7871.969999999999
only changes one thing so if you want to

7870.14 --> 7873.59
infer that it changes that the buoyancy

7871.97 --> 7875.240000000001
as well then you're gonna have to

7873.59 --> 7877.7300000000005
demonstrate that buoyancy effect that

7875.24 --> 7879.5
you claim is there so I only change the

7877.73 --> 7881.54
one thing though scientific method says

7879.5 --> 7882.71
that one thing was the cause so if

7881.54 --> 7884.39
you're gonna say actually there was

7882.71 --> 7886.7300000000005
another cause that you changed the

7884.39 --> 7890.6
buoyancy I'm gonna say okay but only in

7886.73 --> 7894.169999999999
pseudo science well um what you what you

7890.6 --> 7898.64
changed was the balance of forces acting

7894.17 --> 7900.1
on the egg yeah the balance of yeah the

7898.64 --> 7904.31
density you're making this very

7900.1 --> 7906.59
unnecessarily complicated Brenda no you

7904.31 --> 7908.72
can't you altered the there's about when

7906.59 --> 7910.9400000000005
everything is at rest that means that

7908.72 --> 7915.76
there is a balance of forces acting on

7910.94 --> 7919.16
the object right yeah neutral buoyancy

7915.76 --> 7923.24
definition so when it was resting at the

7919.16 --> 7925.82
bottom it was in equilibrium there was a

7923.24 --> 7927.8
balance oh no no no no that's not true

7925.82 --> 7929.57
when it was resting at the bottom it was

7927.8 --> 7931.79
in a state of disequilibrium but there

7929.57 --> 7933.29
was an urn a fall arrest system in place

7931.79 --> 7935.51
which was the bottom of the glass if

7933.29 --> 7937.61
that glass was to carry on and go

7935.51 --> 7939.5
further down and further down that egg

7937.61 --> 7940.94
would continue to fall but the egg at

7939.5 --> 7942.65
the bottom of the glass was stopping it

7940.94 --> 7944.33
so it wasn't in a state of neutral

7942.65 --> 7945.92
buoyancy at that point it was in a state

7944.33 --> 7947.36
of disequilibrium but there was a fall

7945.92 --> 7949.7300000000005
arrest system in place which was the

7947.36 --> 7951.83
bottom of the glass right the bottom of

7949.73 --> 7953.959999999999
the glass was exerting an upward force

7951.83 --> 7956.33
on the egg preventing I wasn't serious

7953.96 --> 7959.56
it was stopping it was holding by means

7956.33 --> 7962.42
of a resistance or a fall arrest

7959.56 --> 7965.84
resistance by the lack of

7962.42 --> 7968.03
maneuverability stopping the relative

7965.84 --> 7969.95
density disequilibrium effect that

7968.03 --> 7974.12
caused the force when you into this

7969.95 --> 7975.53
place right Brenda listen in the same

7974.12 --> 7976.08
way when you put a helium balloon on the

7975.53 --> 7977.55
underside of

7976.08 --> 7979.89
shelf and it stops it from going off

7977.55 --> 7980.7
into space that's what the glasses do

7979.89 --> 7982.92
into the act

7980.7 --> 7984.599999999999
remove that remove the shelf is the same

7982.92 --> 7985.68
as letting the egg continue down if

7984.6 --> 7986.240000000001
there was as if there was no glass

7985.68 --> 7988.62
though

7986.24 --> 7990.8099999999995
well when the helium balloons aren't the

7988.62 --> 7994.5599999999995
underside of a table the underside of

7990.81 --> 7996.51
the table is exerting a force are in the

7994.56 --> 7998.64
opposite direction preventing up from

7996.51 --> 8000.83
rising it's not it's stopping it from

7998.64 --> 8003.740000000001
finding it it's the equilibrium no

8000.83 --> 8006.59
forces yeah the four stops it from from

8003.74 --> 8008.0
rising further a resistance a resistance

8006.59 --> 8013.7
isn't that it is it's not defined as a

8008.0 --> 8015.95
force well it exerts a force and that's

8013.7 --> 8018.58
what you assume that's what you assume

8015.95 --> 8021.59
that's what you scientists Imlay

8018.58 --> 8024.5
speculate that's really nice but it's

8021.59 --> 8026.360000000001
completely superfluous we don't so and

8024.5 --> 8028.85
so when an object when an object is

8026.36 --> 8031.549999999999
resting on them say a lead ball isn't

8028.85 --> 8034.700000000001
resting on the top of the table the the

8031.55 --> 8037.64
table top is exerting an equal and

8034.7 --> 8039.29
counter balancing force against gravity

8037.64 --> 8042.530000000001
which is pulling it downwards and

8039.29 --> 8044.75
probable is because dirty that's because

8042.53 --> 8049.099999999999
the weight is heavier than the table and

8044.75 --> 8052.31
it will try to maneuver underneath it

8049.1 --> 8055.79
naturally because that that is where its

8052.31 --> 8058.34
equilibrium point will be so and then

8055.79 --> 8060.26
the table might bend and try to give way

8058.34 --> 8062.42
because it does have some flexibility

8060.26 --> 8064.7300000000005
but not enough the surface tension is

8062.42 --> 8067.39
too high for enough for in order for the

8064.73 --> 8070.91
object to penetrate it or pass through

8067.39 --> 8073.52
that's how it really works right if the

8070.91 --> 8076.19
table is made of say if the boss is

8073.52 --> 8080.6900000000005
especially heavy in the table top is a

8076.19 --> 8084.7699999999995
flexible solid the table top will flex

8080.69 --> 8087.65
but of that flexion that flexion is a is

8084.77 --> 8091.490000000001
a counter balancing of two forces one is

8087.65 --> 8094.7
the force of the material the same thing

8091.49 --> 8096.41
with gases it's just the flexible in

8094.7 --> 8099.59
another way this is ridiculous you're

8096.41 --> 8102.139999999999
all you do constantly every example we

8099.59 --> 8105.2300000000005
take you try to presuppose that there's

8102.14 --> 8107.75
these forces supposedly or originating

8105.23 --> 8109.5199999999995
from gravity but you can prove it you

8107.75 --> 8112.31
don't need it

8109.52 --> 8114.8
I've explained another way every single

8112.31 --> 8117.080000000001
time and you constantly add those forces

8114.8 --> 8118.04
on top of there it's not required it's

8117.08 --> 8121.34
not about that

8118.04 --> 8124.46
I'm just making us I'm just making our

8121.34 --> 8126.56
worldview clear to you I don't know that

8124.46 --> 8129.86
we'll see you and I'm telling you it is

8126.56 --> 8133.13
superfluous we don't need that for any

8129.86 --> 8135.799999999999
of it to work it's just no speculation

8133.13 --> 8138.59
on top of it I know that you feel that

8135.8 --> 8140.84
way no no it's groovy or don't have any

8138.59 --> 8141.35
proof Brenda you don't have scientific

8140.84 --> 8148.09
proof

8141.35 --> 8151.43
you know this no yes yes you know this

8148.09 --> 8153.53
for a year you believe differently that

8151.43 --> 8155.93
I below it's not about belief it's about

8153.53 --> 8159.41
actual scientific method and how that

8155.93 --> 8162.17
works honesty you can believe whatever

8159.41 --> 8165.83
you want of course you can believe that

8162.17 --> 8168.74
entire set up the entire structure that

8165.83 --> 8170.93
you presuppose yeah nicely how it all

8168.74 --> 8174.41
fits with math and everything but it's

8170.93 --> 8177.17
superfluous we don't need it it's not

8174.41 --> 8180.139999999999
wired to function that's the point I

8177.17 --> 8182.15
wouldn't just look when Anthony had his

8180.14 --> 8185.6900000000005
egg and it was suspended in the middle

8182.15 --> 8187.4
of the water there was there's the force

8185.69 --> 8190.25
of gravity pulling it down there's a

8187.4 --> 8192.47
moral force pushing it up you can't free

8190.25 --> 8194.84
minutes controlled by the density of the

8192.47 --> 8196.82
object the mass of the object and the

8194.84 --> 8201.55
density of the fluid is in that force

8196.82 --> 8205.67
Brenda yes that's really nice place is

8201.55 --> 8208.49
when an object is at a relative density

8205.67 --> 8211.37
this equilibrium and it has maneuvering

8208.49 --> 8215.24
room and then it may gain momentum it

8211.37 --> 8217.01
may accelerate for a while and that is

8215.24 --> 8219.98
where the force comes into being it can

8217.01 --> 8223.33
be directly correlated to relative

8219.98 --> 8226.07
density state of this equilibrium

8223.33 --> 8229.01
suffice that there is enough flexibility

8226.07 --> 8232.27
of the medium then the horse will come

8229.01 --> 8236.09
into being where before there was none

8232.27 --> 8237.73
Brenda listen did you see the fight the

8236.09 --> 8239.39
flat earth interview with George Moussa

8237.73 --> 8242.0
yes I did

8239.39 --> 8243.109999999999
you know when he said gravity is not a

8242.0 --> 8245.6
force but

8243.11 --> 8247.220000000001
we can think of your act yes in that

8245.6 --> 8249.5
there's a gravitational force effect in

8247.22 --> 8251.24
that egg and I say there is none given

8249.5 --> 8253.551
that George Lucas as that gravity is not

8251.24 --> 8257.41
a force what we can think of it as one

8253.551 --> 8262.16
yes really a force on the egg Brenda I

8257.41 --> 8266.39
would think there is one yeah he was

8262.16 --> 8268.58
calm Oh sir was correct right there is

8266.39 --> 8273.17
there is no force of gravity but we can

8268.58 --> 8276.14
consider it yes gravity then there's no

8273.17 --> 8279.79
full right that has been our point or

8276.14 --> 8283.01
especially my aunt in the last hour

8279.79 --> 8286.28
if the pointers of the pointers is

8283.01 --> 8288.65
superfluous we can imagine it to be but

8286.28 --> 8293.12
it's not really there again that's

8288.65 --> 8297.859999999999
exactly what he said like in this

8293.12 --> 8299.42
context what super hot out there isn't a

8297.86 --> 8301.07
force of gravity there you can't prove

8299.42 --> 8302.41
one you can't because though there is

8301.07 --> 8308.08
one there isn't one

8302.41 --> 8311.81
well what there is is it mass alters

8308.08 --> 8313.91
space-time around it in so that's that's

8311.81 --> 8314.33
what happens all right okay I'll give

8313.91 --> 8317.44
you that

8314.33 --> 8320.539999999999
but how does that make the egg move

8317.44 --> 8322.970000000001
because they're two ball of masses there

8320.54 --> 8325.310000000001
are two masses they both alter

8322.97 --> 8328.429999999998
space-time right and so alter in

8325.31 --> 8334.88
altering space-time it changes the

8328.43 --> 8337.73
locality of the egg okay so what you

8334.88 --> 8339.679999999998
count by 10 that is the calls in

8337.73 --> 8341.869999999999
scientific method but if you're gonna

8339.68 --> 8343.94
claim that the bending of space time was

8341.87 --> 8346.37
an additional cause or is an additional

8343.94 --> 8347.841
cause then okay you can have that but

8346.37 --> 8349.551000000001
you're a pseudo scientist because that's

8347.841 --> 8353.33
not that's not what the independent

8349.551 --> 8355.939999999999
variable does well the independent

8353.33 --> 8358.91
variable was the density of the water

8355.94 --> 8362.630000000001
not yeah not the gravity with it how is

8358.91 --> 8364.91
this relevant to anything Brenda where

8362.63 --> 8367.699999999999
is the need where is the need for that

8364.91 --> 8372.74
gravity besides in your soul obviously

8367.7 --> 8375.41
because because the egg is in a balanced

8372.74 --> 8376.97
state in in a you know equilibrium state

8375.41 --> 8380.78
with two opposing forces

8376.97 --> 8383.301
and when you add salt to the water you

8380.78 --> 8386.78
alter its density and therefore you

8383.301 --> 8388.939999999999
change the buoyancy of the system no you

8386.78 --> 8390.711000000001
don't you're inferring some magical

8388.94 --> 8395.391
force Brenda and that was snapped the

8390.711 --> 8397.939999999999
wand into an Einstein I get the

8395.391 --> 8401.121
presupposition it's it's an attempt at

8397.94 --> 8403.4
trying to manage a framework basically

8401.121 --> 8405.951
for the manifested forces of relative

8403.4 --> 8407.091
density but it's total speculation

8405.951 --> 8412.279999999999
[ __ ]

8407.091 --> 8415.851
it's that isn't a force right so then

8412.28 --> 8420.081
it's not acting on the egg then is it it

8415.851 --> 8422.541000000001
affects the system right by changing by

8420.081 --> 8425.331
changing the balance of the forces that

8422.541 --> 8430.871
are acting on right yeah so how does it

8425.331 --> 8433.94
know force how does it do both because

8430.871 --> 8437.451
gravity pulls the egg downwards buoyancy

8433.94 --> 8439.521
is is trying to push it upward Brendon

8437.451 --> 8442.939999999999
right now we change the density that

8439.521 --> 8444.831
alters that alters the the balance now

8442.94 --> 8450.230000000001
listen how Robert see pulling the egg

8444.831 --> 8453.471
down is no force by altering space-time

8450.23 --> 8456.171
around it it's not a force render it

8453.471 --> 8458.15
can't interact with the egg move it

8456.171 --> 8460.61
there's nothing between the planets like

8458.15 --> 8462.681
some kind of like force think that's

8460.61 --> 8464.661
what will be required and Musa expressly

8462.681 --> 8465.86
said that there is nothing between the

8464.661 --> 8470.48
two things that the moon and the earth

8465.86 --> 8473.091
so how could there be because it alters

8470.48 --> 8475.461
space-time which is the geometry of the

8473.091 --> 8480.381000000001
universe time how does that affect the

8475.461 --> 8483.471
egg by altering it in such a way that it

8480.381 --> 8485.211
changes locality really okay well you

8483.471 --> 8486.74
can have that I'll be you can imagine it

8485.211 --> 8489.201
you can imagine it like a rubber sheet

8486.74 --> 8492.381
right and you have a ball on it and it

8489.201 --> 8498.23
and it depresses I know I'll impress my

8492.381 --> 8501.411
sheet right to imagine I know algae it's

8498.23 --> 8502.609999999999
an analogy right Brenda so thankfully we

8501.411 --> 8503.751
have someone called the scientific

8502.61 --> 8505.49
method that tells us that the

8503.751 --> 8508.07
independent variable the one that's

8505.49 --> 8509.811
manipulated by the experimenter is the

8508.07 --> 8510.31
cause now you're trying to be further

8509.811 --> 8512.8
there's an

8510.31 --> 8514.51
chuckles and I'm gonna say no problem

8512.8 --> 8515.858999999999
but you're the pseudoscientist because

8514.51 --> 8520.359
you're not complying with scientific

8515.859 --> 8523.51
method sorry yeah so if I if I if I put

8520.359 --> 8525.550000000001
an egg on it on a spring mattress right

8523.51 --> 8528.189
and then I press down close to it but

8525.55 --> 8530.88
not touching it with my hand the egg

8528.189 --> 8533.68
will roll towards my hand

8530.88 --> 8535.448999999999
lovely story Brenda that's what's

8533.68 --> 8536.979000000001
happened that's what's happening in the

8535.449 --> 8539.380000000001
case of the egg in the water

8536.979 --> 8541.239
oh and by altering by altering the

8539.38 --> 8545.14
density of the medium I didn't see that

8541.239 --> 8548.89
happy rolling though yeah I don't think

8545.14 --> 8551.439
it's doing this it moved didn't it so

8548.89 --> 8554.71
now he's nuts just moved like the egg in

8551.439 --> 8557.5
the water it kind of like shifted but

8554.71 --> 8559.868999999999
yeah our traveling there is a severe

8557.5 --> 8561.64
actual rotation suddenly go on so you

8559.869 --> 8564.640000000001
can definitely say it's not the same

8561.64 --> 8566.739
effect yeah it's a it's an illustration

8564.64 --> 8569.739
Anthony the world is not a

8566.739 --> 8572.14
two-dimensional forelimb z illustration

8569.739 --> 8573.67
in the world there's three dimensions

8572.14 --> 8575.979
the world has three dimensions it's not

8573.67 --> 8577.75
- hey Brenda let me just interact with

8575.979 --> 8579.64
chat a sec there's a guy called stingray

8577.75 --> 8581.829
that says I hope right there are

8579.64 --> 8583.75
sometimes multiple causes - an affected

8581.829 --> 8586.149
result yes that is true

8583.75 --> 8589.029
however what that does is it changes the

8586.149 --> 8590.979
cause in an experiment to a correlation

8589.029 --> 8592.899000000001
in an experiment and as we know a

8590.979 --> 8594.88
correlation is not causation that's

8592.899 --> 8596.71
where that phrase comes from so thank

8594.88 --> 8599.589999999998
you for clarifying that stingray you are

8596.71 --> 8601.39
absolutely right if something causes

8599.59 --> 8603.729
something that would be correlated with

8601.39 --> 8606.698999999999
it though only one independent variable

8603.729 --> 8609.429999999998
broke more than one course Brenda so

8606.699 --> 8612.76
like how did you plant plants need

8609.43 --> 8615.550000000001
nutrients in the soil water sunlight and

8612.76 --> 8617.35
heat to grow if you vary any of those

8615.55 --> 8619.599999999999
variables it'll alter the way the plant

8617.35 --> 8621.85
grows but no one of them variables is

8619.6 --> 8623.979000000001
the cause for the plant to grow so you

8621.85 --> 8626.29
have a correlation between four factors

8623.979 --> 8628.63
you don't have a cause so you can't

8626.29 --> 8631.18
prove what one thing makes plants grow

8628.63 --> 8634.179999999998
because it needs four things right so

8631.18 --> 8636.130000000001
he's at the right causation is not

8634.18 --> 8638.29
correlation that's why we have

8636.13 --> 8640.839999999998
independent pebbles that do prove

8638.29 --> 8643.550000000001
causation now if you want that this is a

8640.84 --> 8646.460000000001
correlative non experiment

8643.55 --> 8648.019999999999
it's actually a correlation that's fine

8646.46 --> 8650.119999999999
but again you failed to prove causation

8648.02 --> 8651.53
for gravity which is what you need to

8650.12 --> 8654.740000000002
are for your atmosphere sticking on the

8651.53 --> 8657.91
bulb well well you're correct to say

8654.74 --> 8663.01
that a correlation is not causation

8657.91 --> 8667.34
causation will always be correlation

8663.01 --> 8677.960000000001
because that's what it means if a causes

8667.34 --> 8679.25
B it will be correlated with B sorry

8677.96 --> 8682.58
Brenda what was your question

8679.25 --> 8685.16
I said you're correct us I heard you

8682.58 --> 8687.229
answer the phone I'm sorry you're

8685.16 --> 8688.369999999999
correct to say that correlation is not

8687.229 --> 8691.01
causation

8688.37 --> 8695.060000000001
however causation will always be

8691.01 --> 8698.03
correlation because if a causes B you

8695.06 --> 8700.31
know B will always a will always be

8698.03 --> 8703.52
correlated with B because that's what

8700.31 --> 8705.74
causation means grain Brown says I

8703.52 --> 8707.99
wonder why Riley's video vanished wise

8705.74 --> 8710.449999999999
people why people say in this video to

8707.99 --> 8712.699999999999
vanish doesn't the video is still there

8710.45 --> 8715.310000000001
and a correlation Brenda doesn't prove

8712.7 --> 8717.29
cause now you guys know your calls

8715.31 --> 8720.56
called gravity and you believe that it's

8717.29 --> 8722.84
proven while were I know that

8720.56 --> 8726.38
correlation doesn't prove causation

8722.84 --> 8729.16
because if you find a cause it will

8726.38 --> 8736.069
always be correlated with its effect

8729.16 --> 8739.16
so what doesn't prove it is it right but

8736.069 --> 8741.439
that's what causation is Brenda I could

8739.16 --> 8744.92
correlate I could correlate the

8741.439 --> 8746.899
demographic percentage of males in

8744.92 --> 8748.43
England with the with some other thing

8746.899 --> 8750.92
and it has absolutely no causative

8748.43 --> 8752.75
effect whatsoever so correlating summer

8750.92 --> 8754.729
is lovely but it doesn't prove anything

8752.75 --> 8756.53
in science which is what I'm guys

8754.729 --> 8759.019999999999
believe that we can prove it in grab in

8756.53 --> 8760.7
science property no I understand

8759.02 --> 8763.16
I understand that correlation isn't

8760.7 --> 8764.12
causation but what I'm saying is the

8763.16 --> 8766.91
other way around

8764.12 --> 8769.79
that causation will always be correlated

8766.91 --> 8773.05
with its effect if you have cause and

8769.79 --> 8775.43
effect then whenever then if it's a true

8773.05 --> 8776.38
causation then whatever you find the

8775.43 --> 8778.779
effect

8776.38 --> 8783.188999999998
you won't necessarily be correlated with

8778.779 --> 8785.29
the cause so what the point is what can

8783.189 --> 8787.6
we prove not can we not can we tell

8785.29 --> 8789.460000000001
stories about what can we prove so you

8787.6 --> 8791.83
can have your correlation but like we

8789.46 --> 8794.319
say correlation is not causation Brenda

8791.83 --> 8796.21
yes I understand that I already said

8794.319 --> 8798.76
I've said that what is the point of your

8796.21 --> 8802.75
point we're not pleased the point is

8798.76 --> 8805.06
that you're the cause of an effect will

8802.75 --> 8806.83
be correlated that's not what I asked

8805.06 --> 8808.84
not the point what is the point of your

8806.83 --> 8810.72
points please what does it have to do

8808.84 --> 8814.72
with anything

8810.72 --> 8818.38
well you can't just deny that because a

8814.72 --> 8821.34
is correlated with B that when you find

8818.38 --> 8824.769999999999
it that that that it's not the cause

8821.34 --> 8827.5
what gravity gravity is correlated

8824.77 --> 8833.439
that's a force with that's really a

8827.5 --> 8836.17
force acting on objects my god that's a

8833.439 --> 8839.159
you can't even compare the two you're

8836.17 --> 8842.05
claiming a costs well there may only be

8839.159 --> 8843.939
correlation and you can't even vary your

8842.05 --> 8846.909
independent variable why are you doing

8843.939 --> 8849.189
this why are you reminding us like yeah

8846.909 --> 8851.59
the cause does have a correlation like

8849.189 --> 8853.479000000001
that means anything to your argument and

8851.59 --> 8857.59
all you have is some presupposed

8853.479 --> 8859.06
correlation this one this is a pointless

8857.59 --> 8862.960000000001
exercise Brenda

8859.06 --> 8865.75
so when Anthony had the the egg floating

8862.96 --> 8868.839999999998
in the middle of the glass if he had

8865.75 --> 8870.88
added even more salt you know after you

8868.84 --> 8872.68
already had it would have floated it

8870.88 --> 8875.528999999999
even higher because he would have

8872.68 --> 8878.68
changed he would have changed the

8875.529 --> 8880.869
balance of forces acting on the egg not

8878.68 --> 8885.01
the balance of forces the balance of the

8880.869 --> 8888.189
density over the the eggs density yeah

8885.01 --> 8891.369
but it's there's two forces on the egg

8888.189 --> 8893.5
no browning your ball [ __ ] please listen

8891.369 --> 8895.390000000001
George Moussa said that gravity wasn't a

8893.5 --> 8897.189
force so if you're gonna claim that he

8895.39 --> 8900.039999999999
walked it was a force that there are two

8897.189 --> 8902.439
forces George Moussa tells you as a PhD

8900.04 --> 8905.77
physicists that gravity is not a force

8902.439 --> 8907.51
Brenda yeah he's correct but weak right

8905.77 --> 8909.19
so stop reading it then the answer is no

8907.51 --> 8910.66
doublespeak Brenda I'm

8909.19 --> 8913.78
I'm really sick of this doublespeak

8910.66 --> 8916.9
droning [ __ ] it's it's not it's not a

8913.78 --> 8922.87
contradiction it is literally in your

8916.9 --> 8925.75
face 90-84 style Brenda yeah it's a

8922.87 --> 8928.720000000001
house of course it's a it's a it can be

8925.75 --> 8932.23
treated as a fictional can he treat it

8928.72 --> 8935.41
all can be treated as it is can be

8932.23 --> 8939.07
treated as Brenda that's called

8935.41 --> 8940.84
pseudoscience no it's not it is because

8939.07 --> 8942.67
you can't do it within scientific method

8940.84 --> 8946.271
you can only infer it outside of it

8942.67 --> 8949.33
sorry Coriolis and centrifugal forces

8946.271 --> 8952.391000000001
are apparent or fictional forces so is

8949.33 --> 8956.141
gravity right because gravity is

8952.391 --> 8957.789999999999
actually a change in space-time lovely

8956.141 --> 8959.619999999999
story doesn't cook doesn't have a

8957.79 --> 8959.980000000001
causative effect in this experiment

8959.62 --> 8963.67
sorry

8959.98 --> 8967.689999999999
yeah the the change in space-time causes

8963.67 --> 8970.29
things to add time nonsense science I

8967.69 --> 8973.36
didn't change space-time benefit please

8970.29 --> 8975.130000000001
no you didn't change you you're correct

8973.36 --> 8977.141000000001
you're correct Anthony you didn't change

8975.13 --> 8979.689999999999
space-time right so it can't be the

8977.141 --> 8982.869999999999
Coles than kind of no you altered the

8979.69 --> 8985.42
density of the fluid we're not about is

8982.87 --> 8988.54
the cause Brenda that language the cold

8985.42 --> 8991.78
yes yes it caused the balance of forces

8988.54 --> 8995.29
to be right all the people in space-time

8991.78 --> 8997.570000000002
was it the balance of forces adjusted to

8995.29 --> 8998.95
a new equilibrium state so when we're

8997.57 --> 9001.65
now into an infinite you know which in

8998.95 --> 9004.43
every state infinitely the one induced

9001.65 --> 9008.13
by the relative density disequilibrium

9004.43 --> 9010.41
or they can be pretty much correlates

9008.13 --> 9014.520999999999
directly with relative density

9010.41 --> 9017.01
disequilibrium that's the cause of the

9014.521 --> 9019.08
force the pre support force coming into

9017.01 --> 9022.380000000001
being it's not about balance of forces

9019.08 --> 9024.63
no it just comes into being because of

9022.38 --> 9027.63
the disequilibrium state of the relative

9024.63 --> 9029.429999999998
density that's I hope you are aware of

9027.63 --> 9031.65
what's going on in here Brenda isn't an

9029.43 --> 9033.36
infinite loop regress yeah she needs to

9031.65 --> 9034.770999999999
be a force she denies that if she

9033.36 --> 9036.630000000001
accepts that it's not a force according

9034.771 --> 9040.220000000001
to Musa but then restate their position

9036.63 --> 9041.74
as though it is a force no Brenda

9040.22 --> 9044.349999999999
indeed

9041.74 --> 9046.75
and with that I am gonna end the show

9044.35 --> 9048.76
Thank You Brenda and Riley for being on

9046.75 --> 9052.18
my panel even though you can't hear me

9048.76 --> 9054.7
maybe you'll hear me on YouTube they

9052.18 --> 9055.87
might keep on discussing endlessly after

9054.7 --> 9057.79
this but I kind of want to join the

9055.87 --> 9060.76
debates it's been a 2 and a half hour

9057.79 --> 9064.69
show it's pretty incredible but I I need

9060.76 --> 9067.45
a break a lunch break he and it's been

9064.69 --> 9069.94
interesting actual real more flat earth

9067.45 --> 9072.37
related discussion I had Brad Riley on

9069.94 --> 9074.5
about gravity on the same side so would

9072.37 --> 9077.140000000001
have ever thought that would happen two

9074.5 --> 9078.58
years ago it was good but it kind of

9077.14 --> 9079.269999999999
needed to end because brenda was not

9078.58 --> 9085.18
going anywhere

9079.27 --> 9090.36
uh there's no debates really Thursday

9085.18 --> 9090.36
are you sure other it

9092.13 --> 9099.9
what the there is a master Bicol going I

9095.551 --> 9101.49
don't know Brenda and Riley are still

9099.9 --> 9103.109999999999
going on but I'm gonna round it out

9101.49 --> 9105.09
because it's been two and a half hour

9103.11 --> 9107.78
show for a weekday so that was kind of

9105.09 --> 9110.7
new and expected maybe to make up for

9107.78 --> 9113.94
was it Sunday when I just did a one-hour

9110.7 --> 9117.09
show but I felt like it and I could

9113.94 --> 9118.83
share this nice weather so thanks

9117.09 --> 9122.551
everyone for coming

9118.83 --> 9124.65
yeah again Brenda and Riley both thank

9122.551 --> 9126.811
you for coming on my panel through Skype

9124.65 --> 9129.779999999999
and thanks everyone in chat for popping

9126.811 --> 9133.98
by lots of people they are too many to

9129.78 --> 9136.62
even name so if you like the video

9133.98 --> 9138.180999999999
please upload it and if you haven't

9136.62 --> 9139.891000000001
already subscribed to my channel hit the

9138.181 --> 9141.391
bell notification so you know when I'm

9139.891 --> 9144.181
going live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

9141.391 --> 9144.96
amsterdam time but sometimes I go I'm a

9144.181 --> 9148.11
little late

9144.96 --> 9150.449999999999
or I'm early and this today I was an

9148.11 --> 9153.811
hour you got an extra long extra early

9150.45 --> 9155.58
show two and a half hours so if you

9153.811 --> 9158.25
would like to support me in my endeavors

9155.58 --> 9161.28
with the show then please don't forget

9158.25 --> 9162.96
don't forget to do that you could do it

9161.28 --> 9164.61
through the super chat but PayPal would

9162.96 --> 9168.15
even be better or any of the other

9164.61 --> 9170.130000000001
projects in the description box of the

9168.15 --> 9173.850999999999
YouTube video so please do support your

9170.13 --> 9176.279999999999
local Arwen please and I will be back

9182.761 --> 9218.7
