storm outside and it's heavy

106.72 --> 112.64
i went out for groceries and that turned

109.28 --> 115.36
out to be quite a hassle i actually

112.64 --> 117.759
fell off my bike twice

115.36 --> 119.2
if you want to believe that

117.759 --> 121.28

119.2 --> 125.119
landed on my feet though but still it's

121.28 --> 125.119
just weather is crazy out there

125.92 --> 130.72
one time i drove through a corner and

128.319 --> 132.879
there was sand on the ground and then i

130.72 --> 134.319
slipped and the other time i got a wind

132.879 --> 136.16
gust

134.319 --> 138.16
right as i was gonna turn and then i

136.16 --> 141.64
just fell over

138.16 --> 141.64
so yeah

145.84 --> 149.92000000000002
i'm glad that's over with but yeah it

148.16 --> 152.879

149.92 --> 156.23899999999998
tour for groceries to to turn yeah to

152.879 --> 158.319
take a lot longer than usual

156.239 --> 160.0
because it is

158.319 --> 164.16
highly

160.0 --> 164.16
stormy out there very restless

i got caught up in a bit of rain too

193.28 --> 199.84
but yeah it's not constantly it's mostly

195.599 --> 199.83999999999997
just this wind blowing non-stop

203.519 --> 207.36
all right anyway yeah sorry guys for

205.2 --> 208.879
being so late

207.36 --> 210.56

right so yeah how are you guys doing

230.64 --> 235.35999999999999
doing okay

232.4 --> 235.36
but yeah broke

235.84 --> 242.56
i pretty much yeah spent everything that

238.08 --> 245.28
i got from the pay pals from recently on

242.56 --> 245.28
food and

245.519 --> 249.519
smokes

248.0 --> 250.959
because yeah it was

249.519 --> 252.84
ran out

250.959 --> 256.239
pretty much yeah

252.84 --> 258.88
anyway i'll make it thanks to you guys

256.239 --> 258.88
supporting me

259.04 --> 265.04
especially flatter sage

261.04 --> 265.04
it's been a real big help recently

265.12 --> 269.199
uh

267.04 --> 271.52000000000004
right so yeah i don't have anything

269.199 --> 274.479
specific to talk about but we'll figure

271.52 --> 274.479
it out as usual

278.16 --> 282.28000000000003
i was watching owen benjamin

283.12 --> 286.479
stream from yesterday

289.28 --> 294.44
got up until 50 minutes pretty much

296.32 --> 300.71999999999997
yeah flutters debate yesterday was

298.16 --> 300.72
pretty good

304.88 --> 308.639
uh

306.0 --> 311.039
lots of technical though

308.639 --> 313.759
so yeah i just kind of

311.039 --> 313.759
stay out of it

314.4 --> 320.44
on rockville what

316.96 --> 320.44
little rick back

327.44 --> 331.199
85 miles an hour wind yeah that's pretty

330.32 --> 334.52
heavy

331.199 --> 334.52000000000004
let's see

335.18 --> 338.42
[Applause]

346.08 --> 350.08
all right the wind here according to

348.0 --> 353.759
this

350.08 --> 356.639
is 48 kilometers an hour wind

353.759 --> 359.28000000000003
guess it's not that extreme

356.639 --> 361.6
still yeah you can damn well feel that

359.28 --> 364.0
if you're on a bicycle

361.6 --> 367.36
though there's no like there's no trees

364.0 --> 370.08
blowing over or no branches breaking off

367.36 --> 370.08000000000004
just yet

370.4 --> 375.59999999999997
but i think we even got like an official

372.639 --> 375.6
storm warning

375.84 --> 382.79999999999995
so we'll see what that turns out

378.96 --> 382.79999999999995
how that turns out so yeah

384.08 --> 388.24
watching owen benjamin which platform

386.96 --> 391.35999999999996
bitchute

388.24 --> 394.0
it's just bitchute

391.36 --> 396.88
i've guys i've linked that through so

394.0 --> 396.88
many times now

397.84 --> 403.88
i'll do it again

400.56 --> 403.88
hold on

417.28 --> 420.31899999999996
right

418.08 --> 423.919
and yeah it's not live

420.319 --> 426.24
it's uploaded afterward usually within

423.919 --> 428.4
a few hours but then it has a lot of

426.24 --> 431.44
trouble loading so i most most of the

428.4 --> 433.12
time i end up just watching

431.44 --> 434.0
like

433.12 --> 435.199
12

434.0 --> 437.68
hours

435.199 --> 439.52000000000004
or more later

437.68 --> 441.44
and then it's just perfect there's no

439.52 --> 442.479
more stalling then

441.44 --> 445.12
right

442.479 --> 446.639
but if you want to watch it live yeah

445.12 --> 448.319
that's a little bit more difficult you

446.639 --> 450.479
got to find your way through it i think

448.319 --> 451.91900000000004
it's through telegram

450.479 --> 456.31899999999996
i have to be

451.919 --> 456.31899999999996
verified by the rest of the bears etc

458.08 --> 460.479
anyway

462.639 --> 465.84000000000003
let's see

470.0 --> 473.759
yeah we had a bit of talk about kent

471.919 --> 475.19899999999996
hovid too

473.759 --> 477.28000000000003
on the live show yeah the live show

475.199 --> 479.91900000000004
lasted very short it was good it was a

477.28 --> 482.31899999999996
good show but it lasted very short

479.919 --> 484.479
nathan went live very early round it out

482.319 --> 486.639
early and then pretty much as he would

484.479 --> 487.599
normally round out the show he rounded

486.639 --> 488.96000000000004
out

487.599 --> 491.199
the after show because he had an

488.96 --> 495.12
appointment of some kind

491.199 --> 495.12
but yeah the show was pretty good

496.16 --> 499.68
talked a bit about ken hovind and he

497.52 --> 502.15999999999997
went live again i wonder how many of you

499.68 --> 505.199
actually know about him

502.16 --> 508.56
because for me like that guy has

505.199 --> 511.28000000000003
quite a history with my own development

508.56 --> 513.2
because he is pretty much the one

511.28 --> 514.8
through a friend of mine back then

513.2 --> 516.8000000000001
physicist friend

514.8 --> 519.919
who actually joined me in flat earth

516.8 --> 522.88
exploration before he well cocked out he

519.919 --> 523.919
was basically threatened by some

522.88 --> 527.279
weirdo

523.919 --> 529.76
over his job and his kid

527.279 --> 532.8
but kent hovind

529.76 --> 535.279
was the one that pretty much

532.8 --> 536.7199999999999
gave me the info very early on about

535.279 --> 539.2
creationism

536.72 --> 540.1600000000001
because i was a creationist before i

539.2 --> 544.8000000000001
also

540.16 --> 544.8
figured out flat earth like for real

547.76 --> 551.76
and that's

549.2 --> 553.9200000000001
that was money that's like 10 years ago

551.76 --> 553.92
now

554.959 --> 562.0
right but he is a tenacious baller still

559.36 --> 564.399
but he really doesn't get it he's not he

562.0 --> 567.36
is like a baller he's not an anti-flat

564.399 --> 571.6
earther and he has a very weird

567.36 --> 573.519
cosmology idea with the ball earth

571.6 --> 574.9590000000001
right so he's definitely not an atheist

573.519 --> 577.6
and all that so it

574.959 --> 580.0
it's kind of fascinating to me to see

577.6 --> 581.44
like how kent basically treats the

580.0 --> 584.959
subject

581.44 --> 584.9590000000001
because it's almost kid-like

585.44 --> 589.2790000000001
and he is one of those guys that

587.36 --> 591.2
actually like even addresses the molten

589.279 --> 593.279
iron core which no

591.2 --> 595.36
no anti-flat earther would ever do that

593.279 --> 598.959
because it's completely pointless well

595.36 --> 600.5600000000001
he does it because he is falling back on

598.959 --> 603.04
basically his school teaching and

600.56 --> 604.959
holding on to that it's interesting

603.04 --> 608.24
it's really interesting to watch and he

604.959 --> 611.1999999999999
has live youtube streams so

608.24 --> 611.2
usually in the night

617.12 --> 621.839
hey elise g good to see you

619.279 --> 621.8389999999999
youtube

625.36 --> 627.76
uh

629.92 --> 635.76
oh man i've been missing gym bombers and

632.24 --> 637.36
i constantly miss him it's very annoying

635.76 --> 640.68
because it's a lot of fun sitting

637.36 --> 640.6800000000001
through his streams

643.04 --> 646.04
hmm

655.839 --> 662.32
that's why they teach you young yeah

658.64 --> 662.3199999999999
of course it is jeff guys said

667.36 --> 670.9590000000001
hello andy hold my beer

672.56 --> 679.279
can anyone go live on tv

677.519 --> 682.839
what

679.279 --> 682.8389999999999
what's tv

695.6 --> 702.64
is there any way to get people i can't

698.24 --> 706.72
often to stop saying evolution violates

702.64 --> 708.959
second law of thermodynamics but

706.72 --> 710.639
but it does

708.959 --> 712.079
youtube

710.639 --> 716.24
it does

712.079 --> 718.3199999999999
hey flatter sage good to see you

716.24 --> 720.48
has jimbob ever asked me to go on this

718.32 --> 721.6
show

720.48 --> 723.519
no

721.6 --> 725.9200000000001
he does address me he's one of the few

723.519 --> 725.92
people

727.12 --> 730.8
that are well a bit more noteworthy

729.6 --> 733.12
people

730.8 --> 734.959
that does actually i like i feel really

733.12 --> 737.519
respected by him

734.959 --> 739.68
i think he does get me he does he gets

737.519 --> 741.279
what i do he pays a lot of attention to

739.68 --> 744.6389999999999
his chat

741.279 --> 748.24
and i do what i do like

744.639 --> 750.9590000000001
jokes art writing just word arts all

748.24 --> 753.36
kinds of things high level as i always

750.959 --> 755.1999999999999
try and he sees that he's the guy is

753.36 --> 758.32
very sharp guy

755.2 --> 760.9590000000001
so it would be kind of cool to do

758.32 --> 762.8000000000001
something with jim bob i just don't

760.959 --> 765.3599999999999
yeah i don't know

762.8 --> 767.279
like really what

765.36 --> 768.0
like he would have to have some kind of

767.279 --> 770.16
a

768.0 --> 773.12
idea

770.16 --> 775.279
towards me because otherwise it would

773.12 --> 778.5600000000001
just be like yeah just talking about me

775.279 --> 780.32
and then talking about him and

778.56 --> 782.399
i don't know

780.32 --> 783.839
but i'd definitely be open

782.399 --> 784.07
to like

783.839 --> 785.6800000000001
do

784.07 --> 788.0
[Music]

785.68 --> 789.92
like a one-on-one or something

788.0 --> 791.839
that would be interesting

789.92 --> 792.7199999999999
and we could talk about everything right

791.839 --> 794.48
we could

792.72 --> 796.9590000000001
i guess that a good subject we could

794.48 --> 798.639
share would be about basically the

796.959 --> 801.1999999999999
craziness

798.639 --> 802.9590000000001
the psychological issues with ballers

801.2 --> 805.279
and anti-flat earthers and what that's

802.959 --> 807.1999999999999
like and how it's developing yeah

805.279 --> 810.639
i think he would appreciate

807.2 --> 810.639
a good conversation like that

811.36 --> 815.76
right so jim bob if you're listening i

813.68 --> 817.4399999999999
kind of doubt it really don't think he

815.76 --> 819.68
really follows my show he does follow

817.44 --> 822.0
the flat earth debates

819.68 --> 823.76
so he's listening yeah i'd definitely be

822.0 --> 825.68
up

823.76 --> 829.8389999999999
to do a show

825.68 --> 830.959
of some kind that would be really funny

829.839 --> 832.8800000000001
maybe

830.959 --> 836.92
maybe it would be funny maybe would be

832.88 --> 836.92
really serious i don't know

851.12 --> 855.92
core i don't know who that is youtube

854.24 --> 858.16
can i get these flat earthers off my

855.92 --> 861.5999999999999
back

858.16 --> 864.399
right yeah 2016 and 15 that's when flat

861.6 --> 866.72
earthers were really like just like flat

864.399 --> 868.56
earth letters splatter sweaters flat

866.72 --> 871.6
earth

868.56 --> 872.959
it was like the wave of flat earthing

871.6 --> 876.0
happened

872.959 --> 876.0
was really catchy

876.88 --> 880.639
but it's not really like that anymore

878.8 --> 883.519
now i mean there's still some people

880.639 --> 885.12
that sort of do that

883.519 --> 887.839
but me personally i'm much more

885.12 --> 891.44
interested in just refining

887.839 --> 891.44
the insights and the physics

891.68 --> 896.4799999999999
getting a better grip on the design

894.16 --> 898.399
process of the wall earth and all that

896.48 --> 901.44
and history

898.399 --> 901.44
right and yeah

902.0 --> 905.519
that's a different department

909.44 --> 913.839
it was someone asking how to debunk flat

911.76 --> 917.72
earth okay yeah yeah yeah there was a

913.839 --> 917.72
lot of that back then

938.16 --> 942.24
the main difference between a baller and

940.399 --> 946.48
a flat earther is the baller hasn't yet

942.24 --> 946.48
realized he's ruled by his own ego

947.04 --> 949.279
no

950.16 --> 955.8389999999999
there's plenty of flat earthers that are

952.639 --> 955.839
ruled by their ego

961.04 --> 965.04
the main difference is that a baller

967.12 --> 971.839
can't let go

968.88 --> 974.56
that's the main like it the whole ball

971.839 --> 977.519
versus flat earth it's

974.56 --> 980.8389999999999
on a very deep personal level it's not

977.519 --> 982.48
even about the arguments it's about

980.839 --> 984.72
facing

982.48 --> 984.72
that

986.0 --> 990.959
like the world and people are being

988.639 --> 995.0790000000001
ruled with lies out in the open and that

990.959 --> 995.079
the majority buys that

999.68 --> 1002.8
internet disconnected

1005.44 --> 1010.1600000000001
right but the main difference is is that

1008.24 --> 1012.5600000000001
ballers

1010.16 --> 1014.48
on a deeper level this is not even about

1012.56 --> 1016.56
the conscious it's more

1014.48 --> 1019.36
it's the subconscious on a subconscious

1016.56 --> 1022.16
level can't deal

1019.36 --> 1024.4
with facing

1022.16 --> 1025.439
the lie they love

1024.4 --> 1027.8390000000002
that's

1025.439 --> 1030.64
yeah it's psychological the main issue

1027.839 --> 1032.72
is psychological and a flat earther was

1030.64 --> 1034.72
able to face that and even find a lot of

1032.72 --> 1037.679
relief in it because you

1034.72 --> 1039.919
the transition once you face the pain

1037.679 --> 1042.0
can be very positive

1039.919 --> 1044.72
although it's not just positive it's

1042.0 --> 1047.679
also a huge challenge it's basically

1044.72 --> 1047.679
upping the ante

1049.2 --> 1054.88
right that's the main difference and the

1050.72 --> 1054.88
anti-flat earthers are the ones that are

1055.28 --> 1060.0
not just not able to face it

1058.16 --> 1061.6000000000001
they are the ones that'll like

1060.0 --> 1064.16
encapsulate it

1061.6 --> 1067.039
and fight that off

1064.16 --> 1069.44
and sink to pretty much any level to

1067.039 --> 1074.559
maintain that fight including pure

1069.44 --> 1074.559
delusion and demonic evil behavior

1075.919 --> 1080.2
that's those are the main differences

1089.12 --> 1092.9599999999998
yeah the ego is what keeps you from

1091.44 --> 1095.6000000000001
seeing that which is right in front of

1092.96 --> 1097.76
you

1095.6 --> 1097.76
no

1098.4 --> 1104.64
no it isn't not

1101.2 --> 1107.1200000000001
i know you mean well rigged back

1104.64 --> 1109.919
i understand what you're trying to say

1107.12 --> 1112.8799999999999
it's just incorrect

1109.919 --> 1115.2
but i get the premise you are right with

1112.88 --> 1118.16
the feelings it's just the mechanics as

1115.2 --> 1119.8400000000001
you explained is not entirely correct

1118.16 --> 1122.799
it's not the ego that keeps you from

1119.84 --> 1125.6789999999999
seeing it's the ego that

1122.799 --> 1129.2
distracts you away it's the response to

1125.679 --> 1131.2
the pain the ego is like

1129.2 --> 1133.1200000000001
now it's about

1131.2 --> 1134.0800000000002
something else

1133.12 --> 1136.9599999999998
right

1134.08 --> 1139.52
that's the ego it doesn't really keep

1136.96 --> 1140.88
you from seeing it

1139.52 --> 1144.0
it's the pain

1140.88 --> 1145.44
and in response to the pain the ego

1144.0 --> 1147.44
wells up

1145.44 --> 1150.88
and goes into defense mode and that is

1147.44 --> 1153.52
effectively a distraction

1150.88 --> 1156.16
like it cuts off the view

1153.52 --> 1157.6
in a defensive posture right

1156.16 --> 1159.52
but

1157.6 --> 1161.36
it doesn't just automatically happen if

1159.52 --> 1164.32
it wouldn't hurt

1161.36 --> 1167.52
the ego wouldn't do that right and

1164.32 --> 1171.6
that's where really complex psychology

1167.52 --> 1173.28
also can come in because you can trick

1171.6 --> 1175.84
somebody

1173.28 --> 1178.0
into realizing flat earth

1175.84 --> 1180.3999999999999
as long as they don't understand the

1178.0 --> 1182.48
consequences of it

1180.4 --> 1184.4
and then they have no problem right

1182.48 --> 1186.4
because it isn't flat earth that's a

1184.4 --> 1188.24
problem it's the consequences that are

1186.4 --> 1193.0
the problem that's where the pain comes

1188.24 --> 1193.0
in that's where the ego then wells up

1195.6 --> 1197.84
right

1198.559 --> 1203.12
and that's partially happening on flat

1200.96 --> 1205.039
earth debate when anti-flat earthers get

1203.12 --> 1207.039
in or ballers

1205.039 --> 1208.64
they start double speaking

1207.039 --> 1210.64
because they say something that they

1208.64 --> 1212.5590000000002
just yeah that's correct then they

1210.64 --> 1214.3200000000002
realize the consequences when their

1212.559 --> 1217.28
nathan directly confronts them and then

1214.32 --> 1221.039
they're like no no no no

1217.28 --> 1223.36
that's when the ego is like panics

1221.039 --> 1227.28
and then forgets again and then you try

1223.36 --> 1227.28
to move on and then you do it again

1227.919 --> 1235.8400000000001
it's like a lockstep effect and

1231.44 --> 1235.8400000000001
they have no control over it

1242.08 --> 1247.4399999999998
hello rocket man

1244.4 --> 1249.76
yeah andy hold my beard it is

1247.44 --> 1253.039
it is wonderful to see the world through

1249.76 --> 1257.36
new eyes but it's it is very hard right

1253.039 --> 1257.36
the new the world through new eyes is

1258.88 --> 1263.6000000000001
that there is more that there's

1260.88 --> 1266.4
somewhere you can grow towards with your

1263.6 --> 1268.32
spirit through your life there's always

1266.4 --> 1270.24
it's like

1268.32 --> 1272.32
you'll not you're not gonna you're not

1270.24 --> 1274.159
gonna be bored

1272.32 --> 1276.3999999999999
right

1274.159 --> 1279.2
you have to remember for those that

1276.4 --> 1279.2
still can hear

1280.0 --> 1286.0
when you didn't know all this you were

1282.159 --> 1288.4
bored more i was bored more like oh is

1286.0 --> 1290.88
this it is that it

1288.4 --> 1293.44
this is it is this all there is to life

1290.88 --> 1295.8400000000001
you get bored very bad things come from

1293.44 --> 1298.24
that from being bored

1295.84 --> 1300.32
i think that actually for my

1298.24 --> 1302.159
personal perspective not saying any of

1300.32 --> 1304.0
you that it applies to everything or

1302.159 --> 1307.2
that it's god's law but i think that

1304.0 --> 1308.88
boredom is like a sin

1307.2 --> 1311.679
and it comes from

1308.88 --> 1313.7600000000002
the inability to face what is really

1311.679 --> 1316.88
there because if you did you wouldn't be

1313.76 --> 1319.2
bored instead you would either take on

1316.88 --> 1320.96
the responsibility it's heavy or you'd

1319.2 --> 1323.039
be more yeah

1320.96 --> 1324.32
the boredom is replaced by a lot more

1323.039 --> 1326.559
agitation

1324.32 --> 1327.52
over suddenly things you see that are

1326.559 --> 1331.3999999999999
wrong

1327.52 --> 1331.4
and the unwillingness

1331.679 --> 1334.799
to be corrected

1336.24 --> 1341.76
that's what replaces it at first but

1338.48 --> 1344.4
yeah you can find a lot of

1341.76 --> 1347.12
beauty in the growth that becomes

1344.4 --> 1348.799
available to you if you dare to take the

1347.12 --> 1350.9599999999998
challenge because it is a challenge it's

1348.799 --> 1354.48
a challenge that pushes you

1350.96 --> 1356.32
your limits the things that you're

1354.48 --> 1357.2
yeah you're out of your comfort zone

1356.32 --> 1359.039
right

1357.2 --> 1361.6000000000001
if you don't go out of your comfort zone

1359.039 --> 1362.72
it's just going to be agitation

1361.6 --> 1364.6399999999999
because there's nothing you're going to

1362.72 --> 1366.4
do about it you're not going to train

1364.64 --> 1368.3200000000002
yourself if you don't get out of your

1366.4 --> 1370.64
comfort zone with that

1368.32 --> 1372.08
right comfort zone is not just like

1370.64 --> 1374.5590000000002
we're doing something that's kind of

1372.08 --> 1379.28
scary doing like a public speech

1374.559 --> 1381.36
comfort zone is also internal

1379.28 --> 1383.6789999999999
right and once you face through your

1381.36 --> 1385.4399999999998
conscious insight that things are more

1383.679 --> 1388.48
complex and that you are dealing with

1385.44 --> 1390.64
people that are enable or unwilling to

1388.48 --> 1392.64
face the truth

1390.64 --> 1394.4
more and more and that there's probably

1392.64 --> 1395.76
even more things that you don't know

1394.4 --> 1397.679
about that

1395.76 --> 1399.919
are on top of that

1397.679 --> 1399.919
right

1400.4 --> 1405.1200000000001
it's a huge challenge you'll never

1402.799 --> 1406.1589999999999
really be bored but it's not an easy

1405.12 --> 1408.4799999999998
challenge

1406.159 --> 1408.48
you see

1408.64 --> 1413.0800000000002
kitty playtime is over

1416.32 --> 1422.72
and if you can't deal with that you are

1418.96 --> 1422.72
going to be very miserable

1423.919 --> 1427.5200000000002
because you won't actually take the

1425.76 --> 1429.36
challenge

1427.52 --> 1431.36
but you will

1429.36 --> 1433.279
see the change

1431.36 --> 1434.7199999999998
and the unwillingness of others and that

1433.279 --> 1437.6
will breed

1434.72 --> 1437.6000000000001
discontent

1442.84 --> 1447.039
right i hope that explains

1449.36 --> 1452.4799999999998
not good logging not good jogging

1451.44 --> 1457.48
weather

1452.48 --> 1457.48
either neither would be good weather

1462.799 --> 1468.0
all right so yeah it's storming

1465.52 --> 1470.48
seems to be storming in the uk as well

1468.0 --> 1473.84
and don't know maybe

1470.48 --> 1474.72
in america deep jeff gussett i do my

1473.84 --> 1477.279
best

1474.72 --> 1479.76
this is this is what i do it's esoterics

1477.279 --> 1479.76
right that's

1479.919 --> 1483.1200000000001
even though

1481.2 --> 1488.0800000000002
angle of approach originally is flat

1483.12 --> 1488.08
earth ball i eventually made i

1488.159 --> 1494.159
i eventually just leave out those words

1491.12 --> 1496.4799999999998
and then the mechanical pattern of it

1494.159 --> 1498.5590000000002
remains and it applies to more than just

1496.48 --> 1502.24
flat earth you see

1498.559 --> 1502.24
i'm all about these patterns

1503.2 --> 1509.96
i'm really glad

1505.039 --> 1509.96
when people can actually appreciate that

1517.52 --> 1522.48
anyway if you appreciate what i do then

1520.159 --> 1525.0390000000002
please donate to my paypal i really need

1522.48 --> 1528.039
it i am broke at this moment

1525.039 --> 1528.039
literally

1529.52 --> 1532.52
um

1543.12 --> 1547.9189999999999
laser being pointed through prism and it

1546.0 --> 1550.159
created a circle

1547.919 --> 1550.159
what

1550.88 --> 1553.279
okay

1555.52 --> 1558.96

solomon moonbuggy do you have a link for

1560.96 --> 1566.52

five minutes into that video

1712.64 --> 1716.159
right i'll check it out

1716.559 --> 1718.799
what

1722.72 --> 1729.3600000000001
that's not as demonstration

1726.32 --> 1729.36
that's a diagram

1731.84 --> 1734.84
wait

1739.6 --> 1743.36
oh 9 45 all right

cool

1759.679 --> 1763.76
all right

1762.08 --> 1766.32
right it's not a perfect circle but

1763.76 --> 1768.08
there is like a circular thing going on

1766.32 --> 1770.8799999999999
i see

1768.08 --> 1770.8799999999999
that is odd

1775.44 --> 1778.44
huh

1781.279 --> 1785.2
that is very odd i've never seen

1783.36 --> 1787.6789999999999
anything like that

1785.2 --> 1790.72
i've never seen anybody test this

1787.679 --> 1790.72
it's very interesting

1791.679 --> 1796.919
just more mysteries about the nature of

1793.919 --> 1796.919
light

1830.799 --> 1835.559
your muddy is that moon jazz bear

1838.96 --> 1841.52
all right

1847.6 --> 1852.799
cool

1849.76 --> 1854.799
talking about which

1852.799 --> 1859.12
uh if anybody that's actually into

1854.799 --> 1861.679
lasers and physics expensive lasers

1859.12 --> 1864.4799999999998
if anybody has like a spare

1861.679 --> 1866.24
is it our cone

1864.48 --> 1869.44
pump laser

1866.24 --> 1872.64
available that they would lend for

1869.44 --> 1875.1200000000001
for a serious research

1872.64 --> 1879.48
please contact

1875.12 --> 1879.4799999999998
father of a stolen child john

1880.08 --> 1887.36
because yeah he's he got he has one

1884.399 --> 1889.6789999999999
but we yeah he needs at least two to try

1887.36 --> 1893.039
to perform my test to figure out the

1889.679 --> 1897.6000000000001
nature of light

1893.039 --> 1897.6
and basically to yeah disprove

1897.76 --> 1901.039
a minimum size

1901.519 --> 1904.32
for the

1903.12 --> 1907.32
photon

1904.32 --> 1907.32
particle

1909.44 --> 1914.48
that's yeah then that's quite serious so

1911.76 --> 1915.84
if you know anybody and any of the bears

1914.48 --> 1918.64
perhaps maybe there's like this

1915.84 --> 1921.36
physicist laser bear or whatever

1918.64 --> 1923.8400000000001
that would be great please contact this

1921.36 --> 1926.9599999999998
guy because we could potentially make

1923.84 --> 1929.76
physics history with this

1926.96 --> 1931.039
and yeah i do kind of want that honor on

1929.76 --> 1933.519
my name

1931.039 --> 1936.64
but the implications is basically an

1933.519 --> 1937.44
entire field of study

1936.64 --> 1938.88
that's

1937.44 --> 1941.519
right there

1938.88 --> 1943.279
like i've seen that 30 years ago i've

1941.519 --> 1944.72
seen this

1943.279 --> 1945.84
and i've

1944.72 --> 1949.279
yeah

1945.84 --> 1950.799
i don't have the equipment or the money

1949.279 --> 1953.12
but there are people out there that

1950.799 --> 1953.12
might

1957.039 --> 1962.64
is it true that electromagnetic

1960.08 --> 1965.279
photons are not the same as

1962.64 --> 1967.6000000000001
from the sun

1965.279 --> 1967.6
what

1968.64 --> 1974.0
well sunlight is very different from

1970.96 --> 1975.279
man-made light space com yeah

1974.0 --> 1976.48
that's for sure

1975.279 --> 1980.159
because

1976.48 --> 1980.159
celestial light is holographic

1980.399 --> 1984.799
it doesn't abide by

1983.279 --> 1988.84
yeah

1984.799 --> 1988.84
non-holographic nature

1990.08 --> 1996.08
what kind of laser experiments am i

1991.919 --> 1997.76
thinking about well photon experiments

1996.08 --> 2000.6399999999999
let me lay it out again i've talked

1997.76 --> 2003.2
about this for years now by now it's

2000.64 --> 2007.1200000000001
it's been years

2003.2 --> 2010.559
but yeah the the problem i have is that

2007.12 --> 2012.0
the entire photon nature assumption

2010.559 --> 2015.279
lies on

2012.0 --> 2018.24
the photo electric sensitive plate

2015.279 --> 2020.159
experiment where they basically fire

2018.24 --> 2021.76
arkhan pump laser

2020.159 --> 2023.6000000000001
edit

2021.76 --> 2024.559
with minimum setting

2023.6 --> 2026.32
until

2024.559 --> 2028.32
it registers

2026.32 --> 2031.84
on the photosensitive plate

2028.32 --> 2035.76
and that was used to determine what the

2031.84 --> 2039.039
minimum particle size of light was

2035.76 --> 2041.76
well i think that that's

2039.039 --> 2043.12
the entire premise is misunderstood

2041.76 --> 2044.64
in that test

2043.12 --> 2046.7199999999998
because i think that that's purely

2044.64 --> 2050.48
dependent on

2046.72 --> 2051.919
the receiving end of the of the test

2050.48 --> 2054.2400000000002
mainly the phones have sent the

2051.919 --> 2056.24
photosensitive plate which is comprised

2054.24 --> 2059.5989999999997
of physical material

2056.24 --> 2060.72
which is comprised of atoms

2059.599 --> 2063.28
which

2060.72 --> 2064.0789999999997
do have a limited size

2063.28 --> 2066.7200000000003
like

2064.079 --> 2068.48
because after a certain point if that it

2066.72 --> 2070.9599999999996
becomes less

2068.48 --> 2072.8
of a size it's no longer the same

2070.96 --> 2075.44
material

2072.8 --> 2077.28
it reacts differently well i think the

2075.44 --> 2079.119
light doesn't do that

2077.28 --> 2081.0400000000004
and i think that

2079.119 --> 2084.32
the way to test it

2081.04 --> 2087.04
is to basically fire half a photon worth

2084.32 --> 2089.52
of energy or slightly more

2087.04 --> 2091.7599999999998
but not enough for a singular photon to

2089.52 --> 2094.24
register on a photosensitive plate with

2091.76 --> 2095.5200000000004
two archon pump lasers towards exact

2094.24 --> 2098.3999999999996
same spot

2095.52 --> 2099.92
and then see if a photon registers

2098.4 --> 2100.88
if it does

2099.92 --> 2103.839
light

2100.88 --> 2103.839
is not a particle

2105.359 --> 2109.68
because that means that less than a

2107.839 --> 2112.72
photon worth of energy can be

2109.68 --> 2114.48
transferred can exist as light in the

2112.72 --> 2117.1189999999997
form of light without being something

2114.48 --> 2120.0
else

2117.119 --> 2120.0
that's my test

2121.119 --> 2126.0
so you have two archon pump lasers

2124.0 --> 2128.64
fire in both at the sensitive

2126.0 --> 2129.52
photosensitive plate on the same spot

2128.64 --> 2131.68
right

2129.52 --> 2134.0
the exact same spot

2131.68 --> 2137.5989999999997
less than a photon worth of energy fire

2134.0 --> 2140.56
them separate no registration

2137.599 --> 2143.6800000000003
fire in both registration a photon is

2140.56 --> 2145.68
detected it's interacted now we know

2143.68 --> 2147.2
that test works out like that

2145.68 --> 2149.52
and that john

2147.2 --> 2151.52
doesn't actually believe it but he out

2149.52 --> 2154.48
of scientific interest

2151.52 --> 2154.48
he wants to do it

2155.28 --> 2158.88
right i don't care if you don't believe

2157.04 --> 2161.599
it i think that it exists i think it

2158.88 --> 2161.599
works like that

2162.0 --> 2167.2
how will you limit the amount of light

2163.92 --> 2172.079
emit emanated well that's yeah archon

2167.2 --> 2174.16
pump lasers they you can regulate that

2172.079 --> 2177.2000000000003
like a slider or something

2174.16 --> 2179.5989999999997
it's very those things are they cost

2177.2 --> 2181.2799999999997
millions because millions of dollars an

2179.599 --> 2183.2000000000003
arc on pump laser

2181.28 --> 2186.1600000000003
with extremely expensive piece of

2183.2 --> 2188.3199999999997
equipment maybe not millions it's really

2186.16 --> 2190.3999999999996
expensive though

2188.32 --> 2193.4
too much for me way out of my price

2190.4 --> 2193.4
range

2209.68 --> 2215.2799999999997
that doesn't make any sense based comma

2213.28 --> 2216.96
are you a bot

2215.28 --> 2218.96
because what you just said made

2216.96 --> 2220.64
absolutely no sense and it doesn't

2218.96 --> 2223.64
relate to anything we've even talked

2220.64 --> 2223.64
about

2229.359 --> 2234.96
i thought a photon was both a wave and a

2231.76 --> 2239.119
particle no no it's not that's

2234.96 --> 2242.0
atheist philosophical garbage talk

2239.119 --> 2245.359
that's people being pseudo-intellectual

2242.0 --> 2245.359
when they say that it isn't

2245.44 --> 2249.839
light isn't a wave

2247.52 --> 2252.32
and i don't want to

2249.839 --> 2253.7599999999998
explain that to you because i've had to

2252.32 --> 2258.4
like hear it

2253.76 --> 2260.6400000000003
probably a thousand times by now from qe

2258.4 --> 2264.48
who constantly explains exactly why and

2260.64 --> 2264.48
he's right about that explanation

2266.56 --> 2271.839
it's not both a particle and a wave it's

2269.599 --> 2271.839
neither

2272.56 --> 2278.0
it it was thought of as a particle

2275.44 --> 2281.359
with a photon concept

2278.0 --> 2284.16
i deem to disprove that by proving that

2281.359 --> 2286.88
less than a particle worth of light can

2284.16 --> 2289.2
be transferred and is still light

2286.88 --> 2292.92
which would indicate an infinitely

2289.2 --> 2292.9199999999996
divisible nature

2309.92 --> 2313.119
right a wave isn't a thing it's an

2311.839 --> 2316.4
effect

2313.119 --> 2321.119
and the the idea of light being a wave

2316.4 --> 2321.119
is derived from the wave function

2322.079 --> 2329.119
which is a mathematical concept

2325.599 --> 2331.6800000000003
doesn't explain exactly why it does like

2329.119 --> 2333.76
i've i instead of wave function

2331.68 --> 2337.1189999999997
i call the effect that light splits up

2333.76 --> 2338.4
in like multiple bands i call that

2337.119 --> 2340.8
a

2338.4 --> 2344.48
diffraction cascade

2340.8 --> 2346.7200000000003
it's a cascade it's unique it's a unique

2344.48 --> 2347.839
to light oh particles do too no they

2346.72 --> 2350.72
don't

2347.839 --> 2352.96
particles never split up like material

2350.72 --> 2356.16
part they never split up in more than

2352.96 --> 2358.32
three bands ever light

2356.16 --> 2359.7599999999998
a lot

2358.32 --> 2362.56
it's unique

2359.76 --> 2364.96
i call it diffraction cascade

2362.56 --> 2368.2
because it is a cascade material doesn't

2364.96 --> 2368.2
do that

2369.119 --> 2374.48
right it is not a wave because that's

2371.44 --> 2378.16
only a mathematical derivative from the

2374.48 --> 2381.359
diffraction cascade which can be

2378.16 --> 2383.68
described in a wave function as if it

2381.359 --> 2386.0789999999997
were a wave it isn't but it does

2383.68 --> 2387.44
correlate with wave function correlate

2386.079 --> 2390.1600000000003
not causate

2387.44 --> 2392.32
it isn't a wave

2390.16 --> 2396.5989999999997
but light is very mysterious and it

2392.32 --> 2396.599
doesn't act like matter

2424.8 --> 2427.119
yeah

2427.52 --> 2433.28
what i'm not gonna use anything steamy

2430.16 --> 2435.7599999999998
traveler i'm not a physicist i'm not an

2433.28 --> 2439.2000000000003
engineer why maybe a bit of a

2435.76 --> 2442.0
theoretical physicist i've not even done

2439.2 --> 2445.52
a physical experiment really but i

2442.0 --> 2447.599
devise experiments i figure out tests

2445.52 --> 2449.92
right

2447.599 --> 2451.92
but i'm not gonna do any laser thing i

2449.92 --> 2454.56
don't know anything about that i i'm

2451.92 --> 2456.96
glad i just remember the name because

2454.56 --> 2459.599
john mentioned it a couple of times that

2456.96 --> 2462.079
that that's the device an archon pump

2459.599 --> 2464.56
laser that's the i don't know anything

2462.079 --> 2467.5600000000004
about it except that is really freaking

2464.56 --> 2467.56
expensive

2472.079 --> 2477.599
and i don't need to know anything about

2474.48 --> 2478.8
it i just need to know my concept

2477.599 --> 2480.7200000000003
what that is

2478.8 --> 2484.3590000000004
and then an engineer can figure out how

2480.72 --> 2484.359
to achieve that

2500.93 --> 2504.0299999999997
[Music]

2514.24 --> 2521.7999999999997
their optimal frequency and amplitude

2517.599 --> 2521.8
yeah i have no idea

2532.88 --> 2538.1600000000003
2017. yeah 2070 was a very hot summer

2538.24 --> 2544.52
and like early spring and all that

2541.2 --> 2544.52
was interesting

2586.56 --> 2590.48
i'm surprised the uk doesn't get a ton

2588.4 --> 2592.4
of wind because

2590.48 --> 2595.04
well kevlar look

2592.4 --> 2597.599
yes it's an island but it also has

2595.04 --> 2599.68
a lot of mountains

2597.599 --> 2602.96
especially north

2599.68 --> 2602.96
mountains block wind

2605.119 --> 2608.8
right netherlands doesn't have any

2607.119 --> 2610.96
mountains it's

2608.8 --> 2614.52
freaking flat it's riverland it's right

2610.96 --> 2614.52
next to the ocean

2623.359 --> 2626.0
all right so

2624.72 --> 2627.52
mountains

2626.0 --> 2629.599
typically

2627.52 --> 2632.079
block wind

2629.599 --> 2635.2000000000003
and they also

2632.079 --> 2637.8390000000004
kind of sometimes

2635.2 --> 2640.319
in certain patterns they function as

2637.839 --> 2642.64
like rain collectors clouds bump into

2640.319 --> 2644.96
them and then

2642.64 --> 2648.0789999999997
like trap the water

2644.96 --> 2650.319
right so mountains usually

2648.079 --> 2651.6800000000003
turns into

2650.319 --> 2654.72
breaking wind

2651.68 --> 2654.72
but adding rain

2656.079 --> 2661.2400000000002
oh you got plenty of rain in the uk so

2664.72 --> 2667.5989999999997
right

2665.52 --> 2669.7599999999998
the open planes

2667.599 --> 2674.04
yeah that's where the wind really

2669.76 --> 2674.0400000000004
just keeps on going and going

2689.839 --> 2693.68
right and yeah the sea temperature

2698.88 --> 2704.079
because more inland it also gets colder

2702.16 --> 2706.8799999999997
during the winter and it gets hotter

2704.079 --> 2709.52
during the summers

2706.88 --> 2713.52
because the ocean temperature kind of

2709.52 --> 2713.52
like balance out the

2714.0 --> 2718.76
the seasonal heat influences

2722.0 --> 2725.8
breaks oh god

2756.56 --> 2761.52
bermuda it's a tiny island gets very

2759.119 --> 2763.04
little wind but high humidity

2761.52 --> 2765.52
weird

2763.04 --> 2767.7599999999998
let's of course bermud i think that's in

2765.52 --> 2770.079
the bermuda triangle right so that's a

2767.76 --> 2771.3590000000004
really weird location

2770.079 --> 2773.599
so it

2771.359 --> 2776.0
yeah if

2773.599 --> 2778.2400000000002
in the typical wind routes

2776.0 --> 2781.04
you happen to have you can have like

2778.24 --> 2784.16
pockets where basically the wind kind of

2781.04 --> 2786.4
passes by and it remains wind still

2784.16 --> 2788.56
like a

2786.4 --> 2791.52
a wind oasis

2788.56 --> 2794.92
so you have those perhaps bermuda is one

2791.52 --> 2794.92
of those places

2829.119 --> 2832.319
oh it's okay

2834.079 --> 2838.0
right yeah rocket but i knew it was

2960.4 --> 2966.1600000000003
when you do things like say in my chat

2963.28 --> 2968.4
because i would never say this

2966.16 --> 2970.64
little known factor bermuda triangle has

2968.4 --> 2971.76
four sides that's just

2970.64 --> 2975.0789999999997

hmm

3122.48 --> 3126.16
yeah gordzilla

3124.4 --> 3128.96
that's freaky i heard that story

3126.16 --> 3131.68
somewhere before

3128.96 --> 3134.4
like sudden gas bubble release

3131.68 --> 3136.3999999999996
and then if a ship just happens to go

3134.4 --> 3139.4
through it they they drop like a giant

3136.4 --> 3139.4
brick

3140.48 --> 3145.16
suddenly it sinks really creepy

3163.44 --> 3167.92
hey

3165.119 --> 3172.28
conspiracy cat suck

3167.92 --> 3172.28
i've been seeing you for a while

3202.319 --> 3206.119
hello rubber digital

3214.88 --> 3218.0
so much disinformation about the bermuda

3216.88 --> 3222.76
triangle

3218.0 --> 3222.76
well yeah it's very inspiring subject

3227.52 --> 3232.24
so people make up a lot of like ghost

3229.839 --> 3234.7999999999997
stories all kinds of things up about it

3232.24 --> 3237.4399999999996
it's not surprising at all

3234.8 --> 3239.6800000000003
but that story about

3237.44 --> 3240.8
gas releases

3239.68 --> 3243.68
suddenly

3240.8 --> 3246.7200000000003
like massive like a big pocket of gas

3243.68 --> 3250.319
certainly escaping like really big

3246.72 --> 3252.64
think of like a kilometer wide bubble

3250.319 --> 3255.68
right when there's a ship there

3252.64 --> 3257.1189999999997
yeah it's gonna drop like a brick

3255.68 --> 3258.8799999999997
boom just

3257.119 --> 3262.44
straight to the ocean bottom probably

3258.88 --> 3262.44
crash in half

3266.079 --> 3270.559
it's like a giant sinkhole but in the

3268.16 --> 3270.5589999999997
ocean

3271.44 --> 3275.44
i've heard that story before i don't

3273.2 --> 3279.839
remember where but it's probably been

3275.44 --> 3279.839
like 20 years ago or more

3280.96 --> 3286.4
and it makes sense to me

3284.16 --> 3288.48
triangle triangle

3286.4 --> 3290.96
yeah yeah

3288.48 --> 3293.839
again vermouth triangle

3290.96 --> 3293.839
triangle triangle

3294.4 --> 3297.76
it's never gonna stop is it

3300.16 --> 3304.8799999999997
but i'm glad that i shared that with you

3302.079 --> 3306.6400000000003
because now you get that at least

3304.88 --> 3308.7200000000003
because i lit like

3306.64 --> 3311.359
constantly hearing about triangles and

3308.72 --> 3314.3999999999996
people not being able to deal with them

3311.359 --> 3317.119
it really does conjure up that image

3314.4 --> 3318.48
of phelous basically singing that try

3317.119 --> 3321.2000000000003
good try

3318.48 --> 3324.4
it just yeah

3321.2 --> 3324.3999999999996
and now you know that

3333.68 --> 3337.2799999999997
that's because i banned you yeah

3336.319 --> 3340.72
i did

3337.28 --> 3340.7200000000003
but you're not banned anymore

3345.76 --> 3349.8390000000004
what's this about the beermuta triangle

3350.72 --> 3355.2
it came up because of weather

3353.2 --> 3357.359
because it's storming and

3355.2 --> 3359.7599999999998
somebody mentioned that

3357.359 --> 3362.5589999999997
at bermuda the island

3359.76 --> 3364.079
apparently it's in like a wind oasis in

3362.559 --> 3365.6800000000003
the middle of where it's usually very

3364.079 --> 3368.079
stormy everywhere

3365.68 --> 3373.0789999999997
in that place it isn't

3368.079 --> 3373.079
that's how the bermuda triangle came up

3381.119 --> 3384.119
it's

3394.0 --> 3398.559
yeah that's just a straight-faced lie

3396.24 --> 3398.5589999999997
buddy

3401.92 --> 3406.4
yeah look if you're

3403.76 --> 3409.3590000000004
whoever you are if you're just gonna

3406.4 --> 3412.0
entry here in the chat with a straight

3409.359 --> 3415.119
faced lie you're immediately banned i'm

3412.0 --> 3415.119
not even gonna address it

3416.839 --> 3423.04
yeah you can keep to your little

3420.24 --> 3425.5989999999997
discord squirting forums where you could

3423.04 --> 3428.72
just lie and revel in the garbage that

3425.599 --> 3431.96
you create and spout and agree upon

3428.72 --> 3431.9599999999996
not here

3441.04 --> 3445.44
but your brother lived there what really

3443.68 --> 3447.839
gorzilla

3445.44 --> 3447.839
really

3459.28 --> 3463.2000000000003
right so yeah baldy cats i don't know if

3461.04 --> 3466.5589999999997
you've been following my show a lot of

3463.2 --> 3466.5589999999997
people have that were ben

3466.64 --> 3469.92
but yeah the game has changed somewhat

3468.559 --> 3473.28
here

3469.92 --> 3476.16
oh my god get out

3473.28 --> 3479.599
so yeah figure out the rules

3476.16 --> 3480.8799999999997
ask about the rules watch how i

3479.599 --> 3483.3590000000004
act

3480.88 --> 3484.96
i i've become more consistent or at

3483.359 --> 3487.96
least i've tried to become more

3484.96 --> 3487.96
consistent

3489.359 --> 3493.2799999999997
just

3490.88 --> 3494.88
don't gamma out at me

3493.28 --> 3497.2000000000003
and it'll be all right i got many

3494.88 --> 3498.88
ballers in here these days

3497.2 --> 3503.48
and they are

3498.88 --> 3503.48
well kind of a joy to have around

3503.68 --> 3510.48
because they don't gamma out they don't

3506.079 --> 3514.119
spaz they don't go into ego fits

3510.48 --> 3514.119
and then it's all right

3517.119 --> 3519.359
hey

3520.319 --> 3527.0
yeah that's not the real wits it gets it

3523.76 --> 3527.0
get out

3548.24 --> 3553.359
making a video the other day amen said

3555.52 --> 3558.96
i don't know i don't know what that

3557.359 --> 3561.68
means either bollycats i don't

3558.96 --> 3564.079
understand the context

3561.68 --> 3567.9199999999996
i don't even understand like the the

3564.079 --> 3572.119
unit of measurement for this 1000 so

3567.92 --> 3572.119
i don't know what he was talking about

3575.359 --> 3580.24
right also also the rules body cats are

3578.64 --> 3582.319
in the chat

3580.24 --> 3583.5989999999997
live chat rules is in the description

3582.319 --> 3584.839
box

3583.599 --> 3586.559
below the

3584.839 --> 3588.64
video

3586.559 --> 3590.88
there's more

3588.64 --> 3593.04
really to be added but it's all subtle

3590.88 --> 3597.52
right after some point these are the

3593.04 --> 3597.52
basic rules after that it becomes

3598.96 --> 3602.64
more about finding balance

3604.559 --> 3610.48
yeah and indeed the rules are whatever i

3607.44 --> 3613.359
say the rules are right

3610.48 --> 3615.68
and your bargaining chip at that is you

3613.359 --> 3618.72
don't show up

3615.68 --> 3620.24
because nobody is mandated to show up in

3618.72 --> 3622.24
my chat

3620.24 --> 3623.5989999999997
and if you can't handle the way i do my

3622.24 --> 3624.8799999999997
show

3623.599 --> 3629.559
then

3624.88 --> 3629.559
well you don't have to show up

3632.24 --> 3634.8799999999997
and

3633.52 --> 3639.64
yeah if you're going to make sock

3634.88 --> 3639.6400000000003
accounts of people that aren't real

3642.559 --> 3647.119
and then

3643.92 --> 3649.599
roll out gamma accusations then you're

3647.119 --> 3652.4
immediately banned because obviously

3649.599 --> 3653.599
you're not here to contribute anything

3652.4 --> 3656.92
productive

3653.599 --> 3656.92
to the conversation

3666.319 --> 3669.319
right

3672.88 --> 3678.2400000000002
and waved his hand over it and said he

3675.44 --> 3678.2400000000002
energized it

3678.799 --> 3685.28
a thousand what only a thousand dude

3682.24 --> 3688.16
when i wave my hand over water it's over

3685.28 --> 3688.1600000000003
nine thousand

3689.28 --> 3692.28
yep

3708.48 --> 3713.68
right by the way i do absolutely believe

3710.96 --> 3716.96
you can energize water but to actually

3713.68 --> 3719.5989999999997
express that in numeric numerics is kind

3716.96 --> 3723.359
of ridiculous

3719.599 --> 3727.6800000000003
because yes you can imbue water

3723.359 --> 3728.88
i have done it i have seen the results

3727.68 --> 3730.16
right

3728.88 --> 3733.92
literally

3730.16 --> 3735.52
seen somebody was at a party

3733.92 --> 3737.599
they were like

3735.52 --> 3739.839
i'm not happy about this

3737.599 --> 3742.319
and then without having a conversation

3739.839 --> 3744.0789999999997
about their psychology or their feelings

3742.319 --> 3746.16
because they weren't even open about it

3744.079 --> 3749.039
i just told her like oh give me your

3746.16 --> 3751.52
drink right in front of her

3749.039 --> 3754.88
and then it's like

3751.52 --> 3757.44
i focus very specific intention

3754.88 --> 3759.76
on the water and the intention was

3757.44 --> 3762.079
oh thank god release

3759.76 --> 3762.079
joy

3763.039 --> 3765.6800000000003
and then

3764.0 --> 3769.599
calm

3765.68 --> 3771.52
gave it back to her she was like okay

3769.599 --> 3773.28
whatever

3771.52 --> 3775.839
and then like two minutes later she came

3773.28 --> 3777.76
back at me like oh thank you so much i

3775.839 --> 3779.44
feel awesome

3777.76 --> 3782.48
so yeah

3779.44 --> 3785.359
not gonna give it a numerical value but

3782.48 --> 3786.96
i absolutely am certain through personal

3785.359 --> 3790.16
testing

3786.96 --> 3791.2
that you can imprint water with

3790.16 --> 3792.72
spirit

3791.2 --> 3794.3999999999996
or energy

3792.72 --> 3797.2
and there's all kinds of things you can

3794.4 --> 3799.6800000000003
do i wouldn't though express it in some

3797.2 --> 3801.52
numerical value that makes it kind of

3799.68 --> 3804.319
ridiculous

3801.52 --> 3804.319
in my opinion

3805.359 --> 3809.5989999999997
right anyway i'm rounding out the show

3807.28 --> 3811.76
