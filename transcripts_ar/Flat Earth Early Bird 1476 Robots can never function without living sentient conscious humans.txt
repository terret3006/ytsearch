56.66 --> 61.81999999999999
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

60.18 --> 65.4
bird number

61.82 --> 67.08
1476 I'm your host Arwin and before I

65.4 --> 69.479
start the show please don't forget to

so you know when I'm going live which is

76.979 --> 81.06
normally 1pm Amsterdam time in the

79.02 --> 83.64
weekdays and 2PM Amsterdam time in

81.06 --> 85.619
weekend and please also do support me

83.64 --> 88.02
through the PayPal patreon and

85.619 --> 90.84
membership system join button that'll be

88.02 --> 93.78
much appreciated and yeah

90.84 --> 95.52000000000001
well you know where that's at

93.78 --> 96.9
quite needed

95.52 --> 98.88
right

96.9 --> 102.74000000000001
so anyway yeah I'm doing a show today

98.88 --> 102.74
because I did actually get a PayPal

103.079 --> 106.32
so

105.18 --> 108.799
yeah

106.32 --> 114.32
early bird show

108.799 --> 114.32000000000001
goes another day the weather today is

114.36 --> 118.46
a bit rainy and cloudy

119.28 --> 124.46000000000001
it's not a lot of bright blue sky in

121.74 --> 124.46
between there

128.039 --> 133.98
so yeah I know

130.92 --> 135.89999999999998
it stopped raining now at least

133.98 --> 138.98
but yeah it's definitely not the same

135.9 --> 138.98000000000002
type of weather as yesterday

139.819 --> 146.11999999999998
but

142.34 --> 146.12
it'll have to do

149.459 --> 151.81900000000002
right

153.18 --> 158.64000000000001
so yeah Special shout out to

156.72 --> 162.3
uh

158.64 --> 164.76
blue pill guy that I didn't really know

162.3 --> 166.44
but yeah the at the end of yesterday's

164.76 --> 168.72
show he insisted that he would actually

166.44 --> 172.319
do PayPal and he did

168.72 --> 175.099
and so there's a new show also

172.319 --> 175.099
uh

175.68 --> 182.0
Susie or it could have been like

177.9 --> 182.0
Godzilla because I mixed them up before

183.0 --> 188.04
also

184.86 --> 189.9
gave me some and gaining wisdom who had

188.04 --> 193.739
kind of dropped off patreon for a while

189.9 --> 197.58
also basically re-signed up

193.739 --> 199.56
no that's yeah gonna come later but I

197.58 --> 202.44000000000003
really appreciate the the vote of

199.56 --> 207.56
confidence and the investment

202.44 --> 207.56
and so yeah I will be eating today

208.2 --> 214.22
I'm very happy about that

210.18 --> 214.22
and I'll probably be eating tomorrow too

214.64 --> 220.85999999999999
right but yeah I'm gonna need more

218.04 --> 222.98
support to get through the rest of the

220.86 --> 222.98000000000002
week

223.14 --> 228.73899999999998
a flatter Sage good to see you first in

225.959 --> 228.739
chat by the way

229.08 --> 233.87900000000002
guys is there are there other people in

232.5 --> 237.18
here

233.879 --> 239.94
there is 10 watching 11 apparently

237.18 --> 242.15900000000002
though so

239.94 --> 243.06
anyway good to see you hope you're doing

242.159 --> 244.79899999999998
well

243.06 --> 247.62
yeah my show I thought that my show

244.799 --> 249.78
yesterday was actually really good

247.62 --> 253.5
except for the last like few minutes

249.78 --> 256.22
where yeah I mean I was kind of under

253.5 --> 256.22
high tension

256.44 --> 261.419
because of the financial situation and

258.84 --> 262.919
the trolls just kept nagging me it just

261.419 --> 265.85999999999996
wouldn't stop

262.919 --> 268.34
and he kept nagging me even in other

265.86 --> 268.34000000000003
chats

268.94 --> 274.68
they're troll stalkers they're really

271.44 --> 278.58
stalkers and they seem to really really

274.68 --> 280.32
hate me specifically me they don't seem

278.58 --> 282.9
to really care about flat side or

280.32 --> 285.9
anybody else Wherever I Go those

282.9 --> 288.71999999999997
specific trolls follow me around

285.9 --> 290.88
the stupid little quick comments and

288.72 --> 293.6
then retract message and it's always

290.88 --> 293.6
pointless

294.12 --> 297.979
so

295.32 --> 297.979
anyway

300.66 --> 304.97900000000004
uh

302.28 --> 308.84
yeah but yesterday show was really good

304.979 --> 308.84
other than the last few moments

310.979 --> 315.38
it was an interesting title for the

312.72 --> 315.38000000000005
video yeah I know

316.199 --> 321.06
yeah unfortunately I don't have such a

318.3 --> 323.16
great idea for a title today

321.06 --> 325.08
but I think I can ride on yesterday's

323.16 --> 328.199
title even

325.08 --> 331.34
because it is like a pretty big picture

328.199 --> 331.34000000000003
type title

331.8 --> 337.56
right really emphasizing that the

334.44 --> 341.1
conflict of people that

337.56 --> 343.62
well or truth Orson they get obsessed

341.1 --> 345.36
with certain things they've learned

343.62 --> 348.0
but then they don't connect anymore

345.36 --> 349.32
because of that

348.0 --> 351.66
they don't connect with other people

349.32 --> 353.28
that aren't willing to handle that sort

351.66 --> 355.5
of thing

353.28 --> 357.919
and so they

355.5 --> 357.919
well

358.919 --> 365.34
they effectively have allowed the truth

362.22 --> 367.74
as they discovered it to distract them

365.34 --> 372.19899999999996
from reality

367.74 --> 372.199
which is everyday life

375.6 --> 379.44
but yeah I also gave an explanation for

377.88 --> 382.58
that yesterday so yeah if you haven't

379.44 --> 385.68
watched Flat Earth early bird number

382.58 --> 387.65999999999997
1475 then I definitely recommend you do

385.68 --> 389.40000000000003
except maybe for like the last five

387.66 --> 392.3
minutes

389.4 --> 392.29999999999995
but uh

392.4 --> 397.02
I mean you could easily cut that piece

394.68 --> 399.44
out of the show and you wouldn't even

397.02 --> 399.44
notice

399.9 --> 404.479
you wouldn't miss anything right anyway

405.36 --> 411.72
it is Monday the 9th of January 2023

413.28 --> 416.78
hey Susanna bucker

417.36 --> 420.62
yeah it might have been you

422.039 --> 425.9
did you send me PayPal yesterday

426.84 --> 432.08
I think I got like multiple

429.78 --> 435.78
Susie so that's

432.08 --> 438.18
Susie from Australia Susanna

435.78 --> 440.63899999999995
from the Netherlands and Godzilla's wife

438.18 --> 443.479
also happens to be called Susie or

440.639 --> 443.479
Susanna so

444.3 --> 450.18
I get them a bit mixed up

447.36 --> 452.639
in the PayPal registry that is how are

450.18 --> 454.139
you yes ah thank you yeah I knew I

452.639 --> 456.0
thought it was you

454.139 --> 459.479
well no to be fair I thought it didn't

456.0 --> 461.34
yes but you're kind of new here so you

459.479 --> 464.699
don't even have a wrench yet even though

461.34 --> 468.02
you you I think you do deserve it

464.699 --> 468.02000000000004
think I'm giving you one

474.36 --> 480.0
you're welcome

475.5 --> 480.0
thanks right anyway

481.819 --> 488.06
like looking forward to like getting

485.94 --> 491.249
some proper dinner

488.06 --> 491.249
[Music]

500.94 --> 503.78
prize

504.36 --> 509.90000000000003
anyway

505.68 --> 509.90000000000003
uh let's see what can I talk about

521.62 --> 524.809
[Music]

525.66 --> 531.36
oh yeah yesterday most entertaining

529.14 --> 534.12
show

531.36 --> 535.14
that was there yesterday was on flat

534.12 --> 538.32
sides

535.14 --> 541.5
about spacesuits

538.32 --> 543.3000000000001
I kind of went Baldwin on him but in

541.5 --> 546.0
chat I tried to get on but he just

543.3 --> 550.04
didn't add me on I guess he couldn't

546.0 --> 550.04
handle my rebuttals

551.7 --> 556.26
but yeah that was hysterical and I

553.5 --> 559.68
argued about it before with spacesuits

556.26 --> 563.16
right he suggested NASA spacesuits and

559.68 --> 564.8389999999999
all that they're complete horseshit

563.16 --> 566.2199999999999
but

564.839 --> 568.86
like

566.22 --> 570.5400000000001
yeah because in a real

568.86 --> 573.66
vacuum

570.54 --> 576.1999999999999
a spacesuit would have to be more like a

573.66 --> 576.1999999999999
flexible

576.959 --> 583.5
tank like a tanker an exoskeleton or

581.1 --> 587.16
like a robot you're basically sitting in

583.5 --> 590.6
right it would have to have like you're

587.16 --> 590.6
basically sitting in a flexible

590.94 --> 597.24
steel tanker and there would have to be

594.0 --> 600.66
like special robot hands right because

597.24 --> 603.1800000000001
you can't just put on gloves in there

600.66 --> 607.38
makes absolutely like that would

603.18 --> 609.3
that's not proper isolation so you would

607.38 --> 613.14
have to have like some kind of room

609.3 --> 615.54
within those robotic arms where you can

613.14 --> 618.24
literally like remote interface from the

615.54 --> 620.9399999999999
inside robot hands on the outside so you

618.24 --> 622.92
could actually do something right

620.94 --> 625.08
and the whole thing would be a lot less

622.92 --> 628.14
flexible

625.08 --> 630.9590000000001
even though yeah you don't even need all

628.14 --> 634.8
that much flexibility really

630.959 --> 636.3
so yeah technically a proper spacesuit

634.8 --> 639.959
could be made

636.3 --> 641.8199999999999
but it would not be so easy

639.959 --> 644.459
in use

641.82 --> 647.7600000000001
at all and it would also

644.459 --> 650.88
inevitably be quite heavy

647.76 --> 651.899
right which will be in a dilemma for the

650.88 --> 653.82
weight

651.899 --> 656.48
when you send the rocket up there

653.82 --> 656.48
supposedly

656.579 --> 661.3199999999999
but yeah there's no it's just not gonna

658.8 --> 664.14
work otherwise

661.32 --> 667.0790000000001
right they haven't even move in them

664.14 --> 670.14
well because they blow up like a balloon

667.079 --> 671.399
yes but if it was like a robotic access

670.14 --> 674.399
skeleton

671.399 --> 678.6
then of course you would be able to move

674.399 --> 682.16
because there's specific joints in there

678.6 --> 682.16
to allow that

682.38 --> 686.399
and you're not gonna swallow like

684.36 --> 687.779
swallow up swell up like a balloon in

686.399 --> 692.1
there because

687.779 --> 695.42
it's rigid it's like a steel barrier

692.1 --> 697.62
that's keeping the gas in and not cloth

695.42 --> 700.019
so it's not going to blow up like a

697.62 --> 703.86
balloon then it's much more feasible

700.019 --> 707.12
anyway it was a fun show to sit in a

703.86 --> 707.12
chat do that

719.339 --> 724.74
all right

721.5 --> 727.68
or to think like uh

724.74 --> 730.92
uh the the robot mechs

727.68 --> 735.2399999999999
that could like that were also used to

730.92 --> 739.74
move heavy items and all that in on the

735.24 --> 742.32
astroma was it a stroma from Aliens the

739.74 --> 746.54
second alien movie like that would be

742.32 --> 746.5400000000001
much closer to a realistic spacesuit

748.92 --> 754.64
I mean it's like just a tank built

752.22 --> 754.64
around you

761.399 --> 765.32
hey LSG let's see you

768.3 --> 774.4799999999999
I've been listening to some more

770.1 --> 776.82
classical music Gustav Holst

774.48 --> 779.16
to be precise

776.82 --> 781.38
and like to some other songs that I'm

779.16 --> 784.3199999999999
not too familiar with there's just like

781.38 --> 786.779
some songs in there and I'm like what

784.32 --> 789.48
also I've been listening to like some

786.779 --> 791.639
more obscure songs and it's like it's

789.48 --> 793.86
standing out to me that he was also at

791.639 --> 794.82
the time inspired by other pieces of

793.86 --> 797.88
music

794.82 --> 801.779
that he basically like

797.88 --> 804.8389999999999
sword to try the base his ideas on and

801.779 --> 807.18
then just like so it felt like a certain

804.839 --> 808.8000000000001
song that I it's really stuck in my head

807.18 --> 813.7399999999999
I don't remember who actually made that

808.8 --> 813.74
I could sing it certain parts of it

814.92 --> 820.079
don't remember who whose it was I'd have

817.68 --> 821.279
to ask somebody like I have to ask my

820.079 --> 823.019
dad or something

821.279 --> 825.66
maybe he would know

823.019 --> 828.54
because that that song was kind my

825.66 --> 831.0
mother loved that one classical song

828.54 --> 832.98
and we played that a lot so he should

831.0 --> 834.66
definitely recognize the tune but I

832.98 --> 836.5790000000001
don't remember whose it was anyway but

834.66 --> 838.74
it stood out to me like this one song is

836.579 --> 841.38
like well that that almost sounds like

838.74 --> 843.899
that one song

841.38 --> 847.38
and my mother really used to love and I

843.899 --> 849.959
liked it too a lot it's very special and

847.38 --> 854.3389999999999
it's like yeah almost like that so it's

849.959 --> 857.459
funny to just see that even back then

854.339 --> 858.9590000000001
that composers would be inspired by

857.459 --> 862.68
others

858.959 --> 865.6199999999999
by other composers and then kind of like

862.68 --> 868.38
go with that a bit

865.62 --> 871.2
like have their own version of it with

868.38 --> 872.279
their own little twist it's so funny how

871.2 --> 875.1
that works

872.279 --> 877.56
Gundam suit would be great yeah

875.1 --> 879.32
yeah a bit over the Gundam suits are

877.56 --> 881.6389999999999
pretty freaking huge

879.32 --> 885.0
wouldn't necessarily have to be that

881.639 --> 888.24
huge but that's the gist of it

885.0 --> 891.24
like a hermetically sealed steel suit

888.24 --> 893.04
with flexible joints

891.24 --> 895.62
and

893.04 --> 899.9399999999999
from the inside

895.62 --> 903.089
control like yeah anyway

899.94 --> 903.089
[Music]

903.24 --> 907.74
Factory garbage collection and

904.86 --> 910.1
housekeeping no steamy traveler no they

907.74 --> 910.1
will not

911.519 --> 915.5600000000001
it's not gonna replace it at all

916.86 --> 922.519
Yeah the more robots are used to

918.899 --> 927.36
supposedly replace people

922.519 --> 930.18
the more actually talented mechanics

927.36 --> 932.16
will be needed to maintain those robots

930.18 --> 935.3599999999999
and

932.16 --> 935.36
it's all gonna run out

935.399 --> 939.54
and then those robots simply won't do

937.56 --> 942.3199999999999
anything right while you could

939.54 --> 947.0999999999999
technically educate any

942.32 --> 949.0790000000001
newcomer some guy to do certain tasks or

947.1 --> 950.4590000000001
a kid you could literally just teach a

949.079 --> 952.3199999999999
kid like

950.459 --> 955.7399999999999
well

952.32 --> 958.98
to collect garbage right I mean a robot

955.74 --> 961.92
has to have physical maintenance

958.98 --> 965.22
and has to be pre-programmed and error

961.92 --> 967.199
checked and all that to do that

965.22 --> 968.76
and then eventually yeah there would be

967.199 --> 970.56
some version that will really work but

968.76 --> 973.26
it will still require constant

970.56 --> 974.579
maintenance while a person can just get

973.26 --> 977.1
that skill

974.579 --> 980.04
learn to do it become really good at it

977.1 --> 981.24
and then teach others

980.04 --> 983.16
I mean

981.24 --> 986.6
that's not going to happen with robotic

983.16 --> 989.519
Replacements at all

986.6 --> 992.1
so yeah they're gonna Outsource humans

989.519 --> 994.74
at first but then it's gonna fall into a

992.1 --> 997.0400000000001
vacuum because it's not feasible on the

994.74 --> 997.04
long run

999.12 --> 1005.199
can robots be designed that can perform

1001.399 --> 1005.199
maintenance on other robots no

1005.3 --> 1009.139
not self-sufficient

1010.16 --> 1016.16
I mean it could be that could be a robot

1013.279 --> 1018.32
that would be like a as a maintenance

1016.16 --> 1022.04
assistance robot

1018.32 --> 1024.26
but if there is no actual repair person

1022.04 --> 1026.5
that really

1024.26 --> 1029.36
well can improvise right because

1026.5 --> 1032.9
unexpected things can go wrong

1029.36 --> 1035.36
then yeah it might help to some level of

1032.9 --> 1037.16
Maintenance until it bumps into a

1035.36 --> 1040.1
problem it can't handle and then it's

1037.16 --> 1044.48
all stuck right so there's always going

1040.1 --> 1047.3799999999999
to have to be some human being

1044.48 --> 1047.38
involved

1047.959 --> 1052.4
right

1049.04 --> 1054.6789999999999
I mean robots the the robot the word

1052.4 --> 1057.14
literally means slave

1054.679 --> 1059.539
yeah a Slave

1057.14 --> 1060.38
when you go to the technicalities of

1059.539 --> 1063.559
that

1060.38 --> 1066.38
slave without a master can function then

1063.559 --> 1069.26
it will it cannot be that slave it'll

1066.38 --> 1073.2990000000002
just be something whatever it's going to

1069.26 --> 1073.299
do so it it can't work

1074.38 --> 1078.8600000000001
it will never be robots without humans

1077.179 --> 1082.0
ever

1078.86 --> 1082.0
not for long anyway

1089.419 --> 1092.679
that's very skeptical

1099.86 --> 1103.78
hello Kai from Gora what

1113.539 --> 1117.74
would it be possible for robot to

1116.12 --> 1120.1599999999999
eventually start making other robots

1117.74 --> 1120.16
yeah

1120.98 --> 1127.4
as long as there's humans that are gonna

1123.799 --> 1128.539
properly program it to

1127.4 --> 1131.419
right

1128.539 --> 1133.16
but who's going to program the robots to

1131.419 --> 1135.2
make those robots and who's going to

1133.16 --> 1137.0
program those robots to make those

1135.2 --> 1140.48
robots that make those robots that make

1137.0 --> 1142.96
those robots right it all starts with a

1140.48 --> 1142.96
human being

1143.24 --> 1149.74
like

1144.74 --> 1149.74
computers can't evolve themselves

1151.46 --> 1159.08
they can only adapt based on the

1155.62 --> 1160.6999999999998
flexible programming that was given to

1159.08 --> 1163.6
them

1160.7 --> 1163.6000000000001
foreign

1165.23 --> 1168.44
[Music]

1188.14 --> 1191.8600000000001
music [ __ ] off

1195.1 --> 1198.1
uh

1200.74 --> 1207.089
there's a whole bunch of Graveler music

1204.0 --> 1207.089
[Music]

1207.679 --> 1213.799
how does blur machine learning work well

1211.16 --> 1215.8400000000001
that's adaptation based that I have kind

1213.799 --> 1218.059
of mentioned that

1215.84 --> 1222.02
machine learning is just

1218.059 --> 1225.6789999999999
a set of routines what you can do

1222.02 --> 1229.7
which have to be pre-programmed Dynamics

1225.679 --> 1232.0590000000002
Dynamics have to be pre-programmed

1229.7 --> 1234.98
and then if that's been properly done

1232.059 --> 1237.86
very painstakingly often it's very

1234.98 --> 1239.539
tiresome to get that right then the

1237.86 --> 1241.34
machine can basically with the routines

1239.539 --> 1244.46
given

1241.34 --> 1247.0
build up a

1244.46 --> 1247.0
system

1253.7 --> 1258.1000000000001
it has to all be pre-programmed I mean

1259.88 --> 1263.66
machine learning doesn't just happen by

1262.1 --> 1265.8999999999999
itself

1263.66 --> 1265.9
foreign

1269.45 --> 1272.489
[Music]

1272.62 --> 1278.539
and the whole point about machine

1275.36 --> 1284.0
learning and learning and the function

1278.539 --> 1286.76
of a bot or program algorithm is they

1284.0 --> 1290.12
have to be programmed

1286.76 --> 1292.34
with a function like because

1290.12 --> 1296.0
computers

1292.34 --> 1298.4599999999998
programs don't understand that they

1296.0 --> 1301.52
don't have sentience in order to get

1298.46 --> 1303.32
that part of what they are like why

1301.52 --> 1305.78
they're there they don't know why

1303.32 --> 1308.059
they're there unless they have a little

1305.78 --> 1309.74
routine that tells them this is why

1308.059 --> 1311.24
we're here but then they don't even know

1309.74 --> 1314.539
what that means

1311.24 --> 1316.94
they'll just have a response right so a

1314.539 --> 1319.52
program could potentially use their own

1316.94 --> 1322.8200000000002
machine learning systems that they've

1319.52 --> 1324.98
been given to pass it on to other

1322.82 --> 1329.1789999999999
programs that might have some machine

1324.98 --> 1331.539
learning but they won't understand the

1329.179 --> 1331.539
function

1332.12 --> 1336.58
unless yeah unless the entire machine

1334.58 --> 1338.72
learning process has been like

1336.58 --> 1340.52
compartmentalized as part of the past

1338.72 --> 1343.22
it's there

1340.52 --> 1345.679
okay it's getting a bit too complicated

1343.22 --> 1348.5
for me

1345.679 --> 1350.6200000000001
the point is is that it's never going to

1348.5 --> 1350.62
work

1352.46 --> 1357.08
some point yeah there might seem like oh

1354.86 --> 1358.9399999999998
Skynet it's perfected itself it's just

1357.08 --> 1362.299
doing all these things designing these

1358.94 --> 1366.14
things for us the itself

1362.299 --> 1368.84
and then it'll go wrong or it will just

1366.14 --> 1371.539
break down at some point it's just like

1368.84 --> 1373.6999999999998
yeah this is the limit to the

1371.539 --> 1375.86
flexibility of what has been given to us

1373.7 --> 1377.6000000000001
by humans

1375.86 --> 1381.34
and

1377.6 --> 1384.559
either it mutates into completely

1381.34 --> 1385.76
unsensible directions

1384.559 --> 1388.3999999999999
because it doesn't really understand

1385.76 --> 1391.039
purpose or

1388.4 --> 1393.02
it'll just like okay yeah there's

1391.039 --> 1395.98
nothing more we could do with this and

1393.02 --> 1395.98
then just run out

1404.539 --> 1407.86
a second Traveler

1410.12 --> 1415.299
fell asleep to good stuff oh a row okay

1415.46 --> 1419.32
I did pass down in the very late

1420.7 --> 1426.799
yeah and that second song is much more

1423.2 --> 1429.0800000000002
pleasant that the second one I gave you

1426.799 --> 1432.86
I mean I could also probably fall asleep

1429.08 --> 1434.78
to that because it is like positive

1432.86 --> 1440.059
the other one not so much is kind of

1434.78 --> 1442.82
creepy right I mean Hammerschmidt and

1440.059 --> 1446.1789999999999
uh egg Don is

1442.82 --> 1448.58
those are pretty ominous songs

1446.179 --> 1451.5800000000002
but the second one I gave you

1448.58 --> 1455.6589999999999
a Somerset Rhapsody

1451.58 --> 1457.6399999999999
weird that one is much more positive

1455.659 --> 1460.94
and interesting has like a Lord of the

1457.64 --> 1464.419
Rings themes things in it and

1460.94 --> 1467.179
all all kinds of like detailed things

1464.419 --> 1468.98
it's it's almost like it's so much of

1467.179 --> 1473.659
Gustav Holz by the way but so much is

1468.98 --> 1477.799
just like it's actually movie music

1473.659 --> 1480.44
before there were movies it's so much

1477.799 --> 1482.179
like that and I'm just I would not be

1480.44 --> 1484.94
surprised the least

1482.179 --> 1486.679
if a whole bunch of movie Music Makers

1484.94 --> 1489.38
really did listen

1486.679 --> 1492.44
to Gustav Holst

1489.38 --> 1495.88
like from the start pretty much in the

1492.44 --> 1495.88
in the movie industry

1503.419 --> 1509.5590000000002
what do you think the next major Game

well there's one unrolling right now

1519.679 --> 1528.5800000000002
it's called perfected

1522.34 --> 1528.58
machine refined psychological warfare

1533.72 --> 1537.7
that's what we're dealing with right now

1542.36 --> 1547.6399999999999
right when it comes to other

1544.9 --> 1550.1000000000001
breakthroughs there's been so many

1547.64 --> 1552.14
freaking breakthroughs this is literally

1550.1 --> 1554.059
you cannot count it

1552.14 --> 1556.3400000000001
that the amount of technological

1554.059 --> 1558.26
breakthroughs in the last 20 years you

1556.34 --> 1561.98
cannot count them

1558.26 --> 1563.9
it's just all in the shadows

1561.98 --> 1565.22
they don't do anything with it it's like

1563.9 --> 1566.539
oh we discovered this we discovered that

1565.22 --> 1569.24
we discovered that yeah yeah yeah yeah

1566.539 --> 1572.24
but we're Mega Corporation we can do

1569.24 --> 1574.4
whatever the [ __ ] we want and we choose

1572.24 --> 1575.9
not to use that

1574.4 --> 1580.419
yeah

1575.9 --> 1584.0
so there's so many things dude

1580.419 --> 1586.3400000000001
it's not going to be given to us

1584.0 --> 1589.52
the people that have these discoveries

1586.34 --> 1591.1999999999998
they have set their ways on destroying

1589.52 --> 1595.779
Humanity

1591.2 --> 1595.779
We're not gonna get any more upgrades

1596.84 --> 1599.4399999999998
none

1599.659 --> 1604.88
the only thing we're gonna be presented

1602.059 --> 1607.48
with is more strenuous psychological

1604.88 --> 1607.48

1609.08 --> 1615.29

1625.88 --> 1630.2600000000002
no it's over

1627.98 --> 1631.88
all that shit's already there you're not

gonna get it it's never gonna be

are there to derail and Destroy Humanity

1669.279 --> 1673.82

I've not seen robot art displays I don't

1677.12 --> 1680.08
know what you're talking about

1724.58 --> 1735.59

1739.22 --> 1743.9
all right so I got the title for today

1741.26 --> 1745.82
thanks to you guys moving that subject

1743.9 --> 1748.3600000000001
in

1745.82 --> 1748.36
all right

1748.7 --> 1753.5800000000002
in the movie what are you talking about

1753.64 --> 1757.6000000000001
a mystical Rock Hound

1773.679 --> 1779.44
the next thing is going to be

1776.12 --> 1779.4399999999998
assimilated in the work

1780.26 --> 1785.48
well

1781.88 --> 1787.64
ever considered that we are the Borg

1785.48 --> 1790.0
it's just not

1787.64 --> 1792.26
as

1790.0 --> 1795.26
mechanical and

1792.26 --> 1795.26
metallic

1798.5 --> 1802.399
Borg is really more like a mind control

1800.6 --> 1806.299
system at this point

1802.399 --> 1808.9599999999998
and hey I'm kind of using it myself

1806.299 --> 1808.96
to a degree

1811.76 --> 1817.419
I mean I am a mechanist I think

1815.12 --> 1819.86
mechanically

1817.419 --> 1824.0200000000002
mechanical thinking works better for me

1819.86 --> 1824.02
than social thinking

1824.48 --> 1830.1200000000001
and even the social thinking has pretty

1827.0 --> 1831.74
much been founded on top of mechanical

1830.12 --> 1835.299
thinking

1831.74 --> 1835.299
but yeah

1840.2 --> 1842.679
okay

1849.95 --> 1854.32
[Music]

1851.48 --> 1854.32
it's

1856.34 --> 1859.34
okay

1861.7 --> 1868.1200000000001
that's bizarre

1865.22 --> 1868.1200000000001
creepy art

1869.96 --> 1873.1000000000001
thanks for the link though

1876.58 --> 1884.02
back into himself was into a movie okay

1879.919 --> 1884.0200000000002
I have no idea who you're talking about

1885.399 --> 1891.339
thank you

1888.21 --> 1891.339
[Music]

1893.41 --> 1896.63
[Music]

1904.34 --> 1910.279
right but I mean as art yeah that's kind

1907.34 --> 1912.3799999999999
of funny although yeah you gotta think

1910.279 --> 1914.24
that that robot is not fully

1912.38 --> 1916.159
self-sufficient I mean it's taking up

1914.24 --> 1919.24
electricity so it's literally just

1916.159 --> 1919.24
wasting electricity

1919.7 --> 1925.24
while trying to maintain itself it's

1922.399 --> 1925.2399999999998
quite pointless

1927.38 --> 1933.7600000000002
but that might have been the artist's

1929.539 --> 1933.76
concept behind it

1962.24 --> 1964.419
thank you

1966.559 --> 1972.7
it was sad in the end I couldn't go what

1969.799 --> 1972.7
what are you talking about

1981.559 --> 1985.539
talking about the movie

1992.539 --> 1997.1589999999999
oh it couldn't keep oh right I misread

1995.299 --> 1999.679
that sorry

1997.159 --> 2002.46
oh so it does actually in the end just

1999.679 --> 2002.46
falter anyway

2002.799 --> 2006.76
okay okay

2004.84 --> 2010.299
yeah

2006.76 --> 2012.899
well cute and very very pointless

2010.299 --> 2012.899

[Music]

2021.88 --> 2026.5
it's not a live it's just a mechanism

2025.12 --> 2029.0189999999998
[Music]

2026.5 --> 2030.419
the only life to it

2029.019 --> 2034.36
is

2030.419 --> 2037.3600000000001
the simulacrum of spirit in the form of

2034.36 --> 2038.3799999999999
programming that is directing what it

2037.36 --> 2041.32
does

2038.38 --> 2042.88
that part is the life of it that's the

2041.32 --> 2046.36
program it was given because it's

2042.88 --> 2048.82
written by a person so it has

2046.36 --> 2051.46
like fragments of a spirit it just

2048.82 --> 2054.659
doesn't have consciousness

2051.46 --> 2054.659
that's how I see it

2068.859 --> 2071.859
right

2072.94 --> 2077.859
[ __ ]

2075.359 --> 2081.48
the only life

2077.859 --> 2084.8199999999997
a robot has is the one that specifically

2081.48 --> 2087.359
designed to assign to him by the

2084.82 --> 2087.3590000000004
programmer

2088.72 --> 2093.52
right I mean a programmer can literally

2091.48 --> 2096.099
make a robot

2093.52 --> 2098.68
they're very smart and

2096.099 --> 2102.04
have a lot of time

2098.68 --> 2105.94
then they can program a human being

2102.04 --> 2108.82
emulator so that it would seem to have a

2105.94 --> 2111.4
life and people responding to it would

2108.82 --> 2114.099
in their own mind start to

2111.4 --> 2116.6800000000003
feel like there might be some living

2114.099 --> 2119.32
aspect to it

2116.68 --> 2123.1189999999997
but it's only because it's programmed to

2119.32 --> 2123.119
to simulate that

2123.339 --> 2127.359
so the perception of the life is

2125.32 --> 2130.3
actually in the people interacting with

2127.359 --> 2134.88
it not within it

2130.3 --> 2134.88
and through well the programming

2136.24 --> 2139.4199999999996
to resemble

2138.4 --> 2141.599
it

2139.42 --> 2144.82
so that's like yeah the information

2141.599 --> 2146.38
inserted by the person to make it do

2144.82 --> 2148.98
what it does

2146.38 --> 2148.98
anyway

2155.079 --> 2160.61
what

[Music]

2167.38 --> 2170.04
hmm

2178.06 --> 2182.98
wow apparently Rasta had brought this to

2181.359 --> 2185.68
my attention

2182.98 --> 2186.94
yesterday night apparently glowbusters

2185.68 --> 2188.6189999999997
did a whole

2186.94 --> 2191.68
thing

2188.619 --> 2193.599
segment called relative density this

2191.68 --> 2198.24
equilibrium debunked

2193.599 --> 2198.2400000000002
but then they removed the upload of it

2213.82 --> 2219.099
did I do a little computer program yeah

2216.64 --> 2222.52
man dude I watched this all the [ __ ] man

2219.099 --> 2227.079
I made I did Commodore basic

2222.52 --> 2229.0
I made like chat animations ASCII

2227.079 --> 2233.5600000000004
animations

2229.0 --> 2237.599
dude I know programming man like the

2233.56 --> 2241.24
most like primitive form imaginable

2237.599 --> 2242.92
that's what I did but I've seen other

2241.24 --> 2245.68
people program my brother's been

2242.92 --> 2248.32
literally a professional programmer lots

2245.68 --> 2251.7999999999997
of my friends have been programmers

2248.32 --> 2255.9
and I was interested in like watching

2251.8 --> 2255.9
them do that ask them questions about it

2257.26 --> 2262.9
and I even tried to learn it a bit and

2260.38 --> 2264.7000000000003
then I figured out I do not have the

2262.9 --> 2268.32
patience for this [ __ ]

2264.7 --> 2272.9399999999996
my mind just doesn't work that way

2268.32 --> 2272.94
but I understand how it works

2275.32 --> 2280.54
I've always been very interesting in how

2277.78 --> 2281.8590000000004
it works I guess you could call that

2280.54 --> 2284.16
interest

2281.859 --> 2288.0989999999997
kind of parallel to

2284.16 --> 2290.74
psychological interest because I really

2288.099 --> 2293.7400000000002
see the parallels in that

2290.74 --> 2296.7999999999997
right programming

2293.74 --> 2299.2799999999997
of computers and programming of human

2296.8 --> 2299.28

2309.76 --> 2316.2400000000002
show wasn't really bad okay fine

2314.2 --> 2318.3999999999996
they had a specific clip about it

2316.24 --> 2321.64
apparently

2318.4 --> 2325.38

they how [ __ ] are you

2325.38 --> 2332.2000000000003
seriously [ __ ] anybody that still

2329.5 --> 2335.02
likes glow Busters I think that their

2335.02 --> 2340.96
are [ __ ]

2337.06 --> 2344.5
yeah take heed Owen Benjamin

and friends yeah

2344.5 --> 2350.02
they're getting worse they're gonna get

2346.42 --> 2352.0
worse they are very much Flat Earth

2350.02 --> 2355.06
Society 2.0

2352.0 --> 2358.839
by their actions by their methods

2355.06 --> 2360.88
they're railing sensible arguments out

2358.839 --> 2361.54
there that have naturally been figured

2360.88 --> 2364.48
out

2361.54 --> 2366.94
and inserting [ __ ] unproven

2364.48 --> 2370.0
pseudoscience

2366.94 --> 2371.56
and like censoring people that go

2370.0 --> 2376.0
against that

2371.56 --> 2376.0
they're not criticizing censoring

2376.119 --> 2379.6800000000003

density this equilibrium force is a fact

2386.68 --> 2392.2599999999998
it's a scientific fact it works so well

2389.26 --> 2394.42
it could be a natural law

2392.26 --> 2396.28
could be considered that because it

2394.42 --> 2398.38
always works there's no exception to it

2396.28 --> 2400.48
there's nothing you can do

to alter

2400.48 --> 2406.18
the effect from happening

you can add other forces but the if the

passive vertical displacement

2409.48 --> 2415.06
that is caused by relative density this

2411.64 --> 2418.42
equilibrium force is immutable

2415.06 --> 2422.22
it doesn't you can't negate it you can

only add other forces

Flat Earth misleading nonsense

2480.119 --> 2485.02
pseudoscience arguments that's their

specialization so of course they don't

2485.02 --> 2491.56
give a [ __ ] about actually facing the

argumentation of the globe with real

technical counter arguments right they

2494.68 --> 2500.68
don't care about that they're just there

2496.72 --> 2505.0
to lead you on another delusional path

2500.68 --> 2509.02
to replace the globe delusion with a

flat Earth delusion

is flat it is the geometric

orientation of the earth's surface is a

flat plane

as much [ __ ]

2527.46 --> 2535.66
pre-drawn conclusions as possible

to make you be delusional as a flat

2545.68 --> 2551.9199999999996
and it's working still very popular

2549.76 --> 2553.6600000000003
still more people getting drawn and the

2551.92 --> 2554.92
more people over there figure out like

2553.66 --> 2557.3799999999997
wait there's something really wrong

2554.92 --> 2561.099
about this

2557.38 --> 2564.1800000000003
the more reach they seem to get

2561.099 --> 2564.1800000000003
by YouTube

2565.78 --> 2573.28
they have enormous spread

2569.38 --> 2577.1800000000003
yeah you get it flat earthers on YouTube

2573.28 --> 2580.619
having an enormous spread right

2577.18 --> 2580.6189999999997
that's how that works

2580.72 --> 2588.0
that's normal right no it isn't

so they're there to specifically Place

2588.0 --> 2594.579
misinformation about Flat Earth

2591.819 --> 2598.96
and they're careful about it they don't

2594.579 --> 2601.8390000000004
do it on a [ __ ] level like really

2598.96 --> 2603.7
stupid obviously fake flat earthers that

2601.839 --> 2606.52
have come on ballers

2603.7 --> 2608.7999999999997
channels and then talk really dumb right

2606.52 --> 2610.54
not talking about that that's just for

2608.8 --> 2611.619
the entertainment of the globe Believers

2610.54 --> 2614.68
no

2611.619 --> 2617.7400000000002
they're creating a similar class to the

globe delusional Believers in Flat Earth

2617.74 --> 2624.0989999999997
to take them away from the actual tough

2620.56 --> 2626.7999999999997
toughness of the reality of facing the

2624.099 --> 2631.92
psychological warfare and instead

2626.8 --> 2631.92
creating another branch of the story

2632.56 --> 2635.5789999999997
that's what they're doing

2635.92 --> 2641.319
more pseudoscience pseudoscience like oh

2639.16 --> 2643.72
my pseudoscience is better than your

2641.319 --> 2645.9
pseudoscience that's the globe Buster's

2643.72 --> 2645.8999999999996
way

2650.8 --> 2656.319
and they treat their audience like

2652.9 --> 2657.339
cultists they say hyper conflicting

2656.319 --> 2660.0
things

2657.339 --> 2662.2599999999998

2660.0 --> 2664.24
right one moment oh yeah a little

density of course density buoyancy

2664.24 --> 2669.3999999999996
relative density yeah it works I mean

2666.7 --> 2673.06
Bobs said that plenty of times

2669.4 --> 2674.04
until he didn't like Nathan Oakley

2673.06 --> 2677.92
anymore

2674.04 --> 2680.2
and now everything he says is wrong so

2677.92 --> 2684.099
no of course relative density this

2680.2 --> 2686.819
equilibrium debunked see it has nothing

2684.099 --> 2691.0
to do with the truth it is pure

2686.819 --> 2694.44
psychopath driven power play and mind

that's what they're doing they have been

2727.06 --> 2732.099
doing it from the start it took a while

2729.76 --> 2737.1600000000003
to truly figure this out

2747.579 --> 2750.42
with fvd

2754.54 --> 2758.619
right but it was all it was just it

2756.76 --> 2760.96
seemed just like a personal conflict

2758.619 --> 2763.859
Nathan has been extremely modest for

2760.96 --> 2767.2
years about it

2763.859 --> 2771.359
literally taking the blow so like yeah

2767.2 --> 2771.359
they're [ __ ] on me and all that but

2771.7 --> 2777.64
like that right

2773.859 --> 2780.819
but like yeah just no no point in doing

2777.64 --> 2782.98
anything it's just starting beef

2780.819 --> 2785.8
right now

2782.98 --> 2788.7400000000002
the severity of the situation has become

much more publicly exposed and so

there's no more time to just say oh

stupid globusters no

they are

2794.579 --> 2801.1600000000003
offensively taking action

2799.06 --> 2804.88
they're spreading their misinformation

2801.16 --> 2809.2599999999998
they're sending their agents their

2809.26 --> 2814.78
very specific Flat Earth narrative

2812.5 --> 2818.26

2814.78 --> 2820.78
the specific nonsense like The Ether

2818.26 --> 2824.0200000000004

dielectric acceleration all that

2824.02 --> 2828.819
[ __ ]

2825.579 --> 2832.119
they go places and they specifically

2828.819 --> 2835.24
spread that narrative

2832.119 --> 2838.54
not the rest not all like details no no

2835.24 --> 2840.66
those things yeah they're not talking

2838.54 --> 2845.44
about angles they're not talking about

2840.66 --> 2848.92
Celestial navigation on a flat plane

2845.44 --> 2850.96
I'm not talking about like even

2848.92 --> 2852.94
they don't even go into the machinations

2850.96 --> 2854.92
they don't even lay down what

2852.94 --> 2859.48
terrestrial refraction really is how it

2854.92 --> 2862.54
was established they don't go there

2859.48 --> 2865.9
they don't inform you

2862.54 --> 2868.54
they just tell you this is what we think

2865.9 --> 2870.52

2868.54 --> 2873.64
think they don't say that last part but

2870.52 --> 2875.859
that's definitely implied

2875.859 --> 2880.24
copy paste their [ __ ] and not get

the wiser

2916.24 --> 2921.66
that's a that's an engineer question

2925.02 --> 2931.06
my technical understanding exactly as to

2928.42 --> 2933.46
what goes on with the radar is quite

2931.06 --> 2936.46
Limited it's like The Superficial

2933.46 --> 2940.14
concept really like I don't know

2936.46 --> 2940.14
if it's going to be affected by wind

2940.72 --> 2945.52
you'd have to ask somebody who's

2942.52 --> 2947.64
actually worked with the Doppler radar I

2945.52 --> 2947.64
guess

2950.2 --> 2955.4399999999996
uh

2953.2 --> 2955.4399999999996
foreign

2969.52 --> 2975.099
to talk to each other with love and

2971.619 --> 2978.839
respect no not necessarily

2975.099 --> 2978.839
logic and reason definitely

2979.48 --> 2983.8
right

2981.4 --> 2985.06
if you only approach with love and

2983.8 --> 2987.2200000000003
respect

2985.06 --> 2990.819
then

2987.22 --> 2992.7999999999997
there's gonna be a failure in

2990.819 --> 2995.2799999999997
confrontation coming out of that

2992.8 --> 2995.28
naturally

2996.819 --> 3002.2799999999997
right love and respect should be the end

2999.76 --> 3005.2200000000003
goal

3002.28 --> 3008.0600000000004
the approach should be

3005.22 --> 3008.06
rigorous

3008.579 --> 3012.079
and confrontational

3012.839 --> 3019.38
and let the logic and reason follow

3017.339 --> 3020.339
or I mean let the love and respect

3019.38 --> 3022.2000000000003
follow

3020.339 --> 3024.72
right

3022.2 --> 3026.3999999999996
it's no point in loving something if you

3024.72 --> 3028.319
don't get anything out of it and there's

3026.4 --> 3031.819
no point in respecting that which does

3028.319 --> 3031.819
not deserve to be respected

3038.04 --> 3044.7
so do we agree NASA lies yeah no [ __ ]

3041.099 --> 3047.96
Sherlock not sorry but duh I mean that's

3044.7 --> 3047.96
so blatantly obvious

3054.3 --> 3059.94
I mean even Baldwin like you there's no

3057.839 --> 3062.18
way Bowen would ever believe NASA is

3059.94 --> 3062.18
real

3062.88 --> 3068.819
potentially Baldwin even came into being

3065.76 --> 3072.3190000000004
in a response to realizing that NASA was

3068.819 --> 3072.319
just trying to fool everybody

3074.579 --> 3078.619
and make globe believe look stupid

3082.26 --> 3085.449
[Music]

3089.099 --> 3092.099

we must reside upon thee that's [ __ ]

3095.579 --> 3098.7200000000003
Clary you know it

3099.3 --> 3102.92
don't reside upon anything

3103.2 --> 3108.5989999999997
it's transferring through the matter the

3106.92 --> 3113.46
medium

3108.599 --> 3116.88
for radar and light is the material

3113.46 --> 3120.98
realm it's the matter it goes through

3116.88 --> 3120.98
the matter the medium is the matter

3121.079 --> 3124.92
okay

3122.24 --> 3127.0789999999997
and wind

3124.92 --> 3130.14
like air moving

3127.079 --> 3132.9
I don't know if that influences it I

3130.14 --> 3135.5989999999997
just don't know it's a technical

3132.9 --> 3138.0
question that I cannot answer with the

3135.599 --> 3140.6400000000003
information I currently have

3138.0 --> 3144.24
But to infer that there must be an ether

3140.64 --> 3148.46
that is absolute horseshit

3144.24 --> 3148.4599999999996
is no physical evidence

3149.7 --> 3156.48
it's a misunderstanding

3153.599 --> 3160.559
it's a misassumption

3156.48 --> 3165.079
light doesn't need a medium it's not a

wave a wave function is a mathematical

derivation not actually a wave I mean

3169.44 --> 3174.38
how many [ __ ] times does this need to

3171.54 --> 3174.38
be shared man

3178.2 --> 3185.5789999999997
it's not a wave there's plenty of forms

3180.839 --> 3188.42
of ether light medium ether does not

exist

3192.44 --> 3196.52
it's not a wave

3206.4 --> 3212.339
rebranding you [ __ ]

3209.28 --> 3215.28
I just stop using your blabber mouth for

saying really dumb things that you

talking about

3221.76 --> 3227.1800000000003
quantum mechanics has nothing to do with

3224.819 --> 3227.18
ether

3227.819 --> 3233.099
quantum mechanics is the study of the

micro properties

3233.099 --> 3238.98
of matter and Light

3235.98 --> 3242.52

3238.98 --> 3244.2
has nothing to do with ether it's not a

3244.2 --> 3249.4199999999996
there's no proof of ether that comes

3246.599 --> 3252.1800000000003
comes out of quantum mechanics okay

3249.42 --> 3256.52
light is not a wave quantum mechanics

3252.18 --> 3256.52
recognizes that light is not a wave

there is no electromagnetic spectrum

say things

I'm gonna move my show how about that

you don't have that control I don't even

know who you are

the electricity or the magnetism

you got some stuff I need to do right so

3709.799 --> 3716.42
you immediately did it again

3712.74 --> 3716.4199999999996

3716.94 --> 3721.619
yeah I don't need any advice on what to

do

3721.619 --> 3729.48
I don't need to be told what I need

or whatever newcomer

3739.44 --> 3744.299
didn't they start all yeah that's

3741.599 --> 3746.54
correct zap tappy yeah that's right when

3744.299 --> 3748.799
Bob used his broken

gyroscope that drifted because

3748.799 --> 3754.92
gyroscopes the drift are effectively

broken and then he inferred because of

that horseshit test

3757.859 --> 3763.2
that oh this must be eating with in your

how can we ever forget

3769.559 --> 3772.559

3774.599 --> 3780.2000000000003

[Music]

3809.04 --> 3815.579
I mean this is really the point where we

can actually come together with globers

3815.579 --> 3819.599
about this

3817.44 --> 3823.02
because there's probably globers that

3819.599 --> 3825.96
remember a lot of [ __ ] from globusters

3823.02 --> 3827.52
for whatever reason they've watched that

3825.96 --> 3831.48
and

3827.52 --> 3834.72
we need to all together unravel this

3831.48 --> 3837.119
festering plague that is unrolling and

3834.72 --> 3838.08
trying to create another globe in the

form of Flat Earth

3838.08 --> 3843.5989999999997

3840.18 --> 3846.48

that as well not the total anti-flat

3846.48 --> 3851.7
Earth's weenie wankers of course they're

3849.18 --> 3854.94
gonna side with them yeah you get it

3851.7 --> 3856.799
those pieces of [ __ ] Are Gonna side with

3854.94 --> 3859.5
glowbusters

3856.799 --> 3862.619
it's a prediction yeah that's literally

3859.5 --> 3864.359
a prediction I'm making right now they

3862.619 --> 3867.7200000000003
will do that

3864.359 --> 3868.68
yeah because globusters isn't a threat

3867.72 --> 3871.4399999999996
to them

3868.68 --> 3874.02
it is because they get everything wrong

3871.44 --> 3876.48
and just replace it with garbage that

3874.02 --> 3879.48
they can very easily point at and laugh

3876.48 --> 3882.059
over because they know it's garbage

3879.48 --> 3884.88
yeah they don't have that luxury with

3882.059 --> 3887.4
flat Earth debates at all

3884.88 --> 3890.94
so they will sign with them

3887.4 --> 3893.819
what I need is Ballers that might

3890.94 --> 3896.579
believe the ball right it's hard to get

yeah that's actually scary that's not

3950.579 --> 3955.8590000000004
what flat earthers should be associated

3953.04 --> 3959.16
with it's gonna get us into trouble

3955.859 --> 3960.9
which is what they're doing it for

3959.16 --> 3965.52
yeah

3960.9 --> 3969.92
it's to Snuff Flat Earth out by making

3965.52 --> 3969.92
it look [ __ ] and cultish

3970.76 --> 3977.0400000000004
through what they're saying

3974.579 --> 3978.96
through the supposed argumentation it's

3977.04 --> 3980.88
barely argumentation

3978.96 --> 3984.2
and through the peer pressuring that

3980.88 --> 3984.2000000000003
they do continually

like a branch of the flat air society

4007.7 --> 4013.0389999999998

4010.339 --> 4015.319
using that formula they're stepping in

4013.039 --> 4018.619
that function

4015.319 --> 4021.2
it could be very much grassroot it's

4018.619 --> 4023.299
just yeah oh we're Psychopaths oh you're

4021.2 --> 4024.5789999999997

4029.839 --> 4035.119
forget all about Flat Earth again and

4032.42 --> 4036.799
insert the globe again because nobody

4035.119 --> 4040.6600000000003

4036.799 --> 4040.66
we've made them all [ __ ]

organizational hierarchy connection with

4054.02 --> 4056.44
that group

4057.039 --> 4062.6800000000003
it's just the formula

4059.539 --> 4062.6800000000003
it's what they do

4069.14 --> 4074.42
when wheeler calls himself a monkey yeah

4072.319 --> 4076.16

flatter society says at this point

4308.96 --> 4314.26
they openly claim an outer space

4314.42 --> 4321.86
which is absolutely ridiculous

4318.32 --> 4324.08
like that is the Cornerstone that needs

4321.86 --> 4326.719
to be disproven that's like the thing

4324.08 --> 4329.84
like outer space not being real that is

4326.719 --> 4332.5
the big Cornerstone of the Flat Earth

4329.84 --> 4332.5
revelation

4333.08 --> 4339.5199999999995
who the hell gives a [ __ ] what they have

4335.48 --> 4339.5199999999995
to say after that claim

4348.26 --> 4353.179
a tiny organization but it's not about

the popularity contest

4353.179 --> 4358.04
Cleary

4354.44 --> 4361.58
yeah the organization is not about

social networking yeah it's not like a

4361.58 --> 4366.0199999999995
YouTube Community or anything it's not

4363.5 --> 4367.64
what they are what it is is an

4366.02 --> 4369.26
organization that's been around for

4367.64 --> 4372.38
decades

4369.26 --> 4374.3
and that is specifically there as a

4372.38 --> 4377.12
fallback reference

4374.3 --> 4380.9800000000005
for whenever somebody needs to point at

4377.12 --> 4380.98
how stupid flat earthers are

4381.32 --> 4388.219
that's what they're there for not as a

[Music]

4471.86 --> 4474.82
all right anyway

4475.1 --> 4479.14
hey clap Ruckus good to see you man

4490.88 --> 4497.08
a lot of people that think fear is

4493.159 --> 4497.08
stupid sure spend a lot of time here

4500.0 --> 4505.76
yeah some of them

4503.719 --> 4508.04
because they're very curious and they

4505.76 --> 4510.860000000001
just like the whole oh it's stupid it's

4508.04 --> 4513.08
just a reflex because they're scared

4510.86 --> 4515.78
right they can be admitted to actually

4513.08 --> 4517.34
be curious about it so that's there a

4515.78 --> 4518.659
lot of Gammas just are like yeah stupid

4517.34 --> 4520.34
Flat Earth but they're the secret he's

4518.659 --> 4524.239
like oh what are they saying what are

4520.34 --> 4527.78
they saying right and there is a lot of

4524.239 --> 4530.9
bots there's least anti-flat earthers

4527.78 --> 4534.5
and they have been making Bots to

4530.9 --> 4537.04
specifically nag flat earthers those are

4534.5 --> 4537.04
not people

4537.98 --> 4546.0199999999995
so there seems a lot more ballers

4542.0 --> 4548.54
nagging us then they're actually around

4546.02 --> 4551.3
I mean most people are not miserable

4548.54 --> 4552.98
enough to actually be a stalking troll

4551.3 --> 4557.179
like that

4552.98 --> 4561.5599999999995
like in person right but those bastards

4557.179 --> 4563.96
program [ __ ] Bots to be like that

4561.56 --> 4565.88
and they carry their miserable spirit

4563.96 --> 4568.04
because of that

4565.88 --> 4569.719
so it's very tough you sometimes to even

4568.04 --> 4572.239
distinguish because they're just those

4569.719 --> 4576.159
Bots are just as miserable misery

4572.239 --> 4576.159
radiating as the real person

4578.12 --> 4587.8

4698.36 --> 4703.0599999999995
I think clear is buggered off though

4711.46 --> 4717.56
right anyway uh take it easy or else I

4715.28 --> 4719.3
don't go too far now I'm gonna take a

4717.56 --> 4722.38
two-minute break

4719.3 --> 4722.38
be right back

4749.199 --> 4755.08
or not

4752.48 --> 4755.08
all right

4759.32 --> 4763.719
I have to try again later

4768.44 --> 4772.159
ever wondered why the slits in the

4770.54 --> 4773.78
double slit experiment are vertical on

4772.159 --> 4776.32
that horizontal

4773.78 --> 4776.32
now

4776.6 --> 4781.46
it works the same when they're vertical

4779.36 --> 4784.599999999999
I mean you can literally turn that thing

4781.46 --> 4784.6
around and the whole

4785.08 --> 4789.4
situation will be rotating so

4793.1 --> 4796.659000000001
why are you wondering that

4797.54 --> 4800.84
are you still under the Mis assumption

4799.52 --> 4804.38
that there's some kind of a wave

4800.84 --> 4806.96
situation are you imagining how light is

4804.38 --> 4809.78
just rolling out like water and just

4806.96 --> 4812.12
like you get to see the comparison

4809.78 --> 4814.639999999999
animation

4812.12 --> 4816.98
glary

4814.64 --> 4818.719
yeah it's not the case though yeah it's

4816.98 --> 4820.879999999999
all straight beams

4818.719 --> 4823.82
yeah the diffraction Cascade in that

4820.88 --> 4826.04
pattern that wave like pattern yeah it's

4823.82 --> 4828.0199999999995
all straight beams

4826.04 --> 4830.659
yeah and if you change the orientation

4828.02 --> 4833.0
of the slits then the whole situation

4830.659 --> 4837.219
changes with it

4833.0 --> 4837.219
I mean that's pretty damn obvious

4839.3 --> 4842.7390000000005
white has polarity

4842.78 --> 4848.96
okay

4845.239 --> 4849.919999999999
well that's not an answer to your

4848.96 --> 4852.699
question

4849.92 --> 4852.6990000000005
at all

4856.04 --> 4861.8
pretty sure the double slit is not

4858.32 --> 4864.799999999999
typically presented horizontally because

4861.8 --> 4867.7390000000005
light has polarity

4864.8 --> 4870.6990000000005
that's a really nonsensical answer to

4867.739 --> 4870.699
your own question there

4901.82 --> 4909.799999999999
stop being a speculating dumbass

4905.78 --> 4909.8
and actually listen

4910.4 --> 4917.799999999999
to the data listen to what it is figure

4914.36 --> 4917.799999999999
out what's actually going on

4918.02 --> 4923.06
yeah something that you obviously are

4921.02 --> 4926.900000000001
lacking in because you're making very

4923.06 --> 4929.6
bizarre assumptions about this setup

4926.9 --> 4932.199
with the double slit very very weird

4929.6 --> 4932.1990000000005
Clary

4937.34 --> 4943.64
because the Sun have a top then what

4940.12 --> 4945.44
okay anyway I'm gonna take my two minute

what you think that that is literally

5182.44 --> 5186.48
real

5183.58 --> 5186.48
that model

5188.5 --> 5191.28
literally

5192.1 --> 5197.26
you think that that that video you just

5195.219 --> 5198.4
shared that that's literally what light

5197.26 --> 5200.62
is

5198.4 --> 5201.4
right if that's literally what light is

5200.62 --> 5204.099999999999
then

5201.4 --> 5208.96
what if you shoot it for a tiny little

5204.1 --> 5212.5
hole and that wave thing sticks out too

5208.96 --> 5215.88
much oh wait no it's because it's not

5212.5 --> 5218.139
literally that it's just a mathematical

5215.88 --> 5221.89
representation based on a wave

5218.139 --> 5225.14

I've had long hair

5302.5 --> 5305.04
oh

5305.08 --> 5311.699
two-thirds of my no wait

5307.6 --> 5311.6990000000005
three quarters of my life huh

5313.84 --> 5320.6990000000005
almost three quarters since I was 12.

5316.84 --> 5320.6990000000005
never cut it no not once

5322.659 --> 5327.28
I had to really fight for it because in

5325.12 --> 5329.8
the school where I went boys weren't

5327.28 --> 5333.5199999999995
even allowed to have long hair

5329.8 --> 5335.8
yet I was growing it and literally like

5333.52 --> 5337.42
the management was not happy about that

5335.8 --> 5340.42
because

5337.42 --> 5344.04
I was basically

5340.42 --> 5344.04
not falling in line

5345.34 --> 5348.360000000001
but yeah

5348.94 --> 5353.919999999999
I mean all the men funnily enough in my

5351.699 --> 5356.44
family my brother and my dad all used to

5353.92 --> 5358.9
have long hair back in the day

5356.44 --> 5361.599999999999
30 years ago

5358.9 --> 5363.4
it was really funny we all had like the

5361.6 --> 5364.620000000001
all the men had long hair but my mother

5363.4 --> 5369.099999999999
didn't

5364.62 --> 5369.099999999999
we were really liberal

5370.8 --> 5375.52
but yeah I'm very happy with my long

5373.239 --> 5377.379999999999
hair I I take good care of it I'm very

5375.52 --> 5380.4400000000005
careful

5377.38 --> 5382.6
and it's been pretty good to me

5380.44 --> 5385.719
I mean people have been telling you oh

5382.6 --> 5389.4400000000005
Irwin oh you're gonna go bald when I was

5385.719 --> 5392.26
freaking 20 man I mean it's [ __ ]

5389.44 --> 5395.08
my hair is pretty damn good yeah I mean

5392.26 --> 5398.280000000001
it's not gonna last forever and do but

5395.08 --> 5401.32
it's my hair is naturally really thin

5398.28 --> 5404.44
it's a freaking Miracle it's this good

5401.32 --> 5407.0199999999995
okay a miracle and I'm very happy about

5404.44 --> 5409.54
that thank you God

5407.02 --> 5413.219
thank you God for this design

5409.54 --> 5413.219
in that aspect at least

5413.26 --> 5415.9800000000005
ah

5417.28 --> 5420.54
good for you then

5422.139 --> 5426.34
it's complicated

5426.34 --> 5431.16
it's not good at all

5427.94 --> 5431.16
[Music]

5431.8 --> 5437.320000000001
good enough that my ex-girlfriend was

5434.92 --> 5441.0
quite attracted

5437.32 --> 5441.0
partially because of my long hair

5444.699 --> 5453.219
and she was quite the catch so screw you

5450.159 --> 5455.739
you can't just indoctrinate me with

5453.219 --> 5458.679
insecurity I know I am freaking

5455.739 --> 5462.099999999999
attractive to certain types of women I

5458.679 --> 5464.1990000000005
know I am I don't abuse it

5462.1 --> 5467.08
I try to be gracious with it it's like

5464.199 --> 5469.5
oh they like me okay let's not ruin that

5467.08 --> 5469.5
for them

5473.32 --> 5479.739
I mean overall I'm much more insecure

5476.5 --> 5482.5
about like the the wearing of my

5479.739 --> 5486.4
clothing then I do my actual physical

5482.5 --> 5489.76
looks okay I I mean

5486.4 --> 5491.92
I even consider that my looks is the

5489.76 --> 5497.26
thing that makes up for my clothes being

5491.92 --> 5500.46
so worn down and all that so yeah I have

5497.26 --> 5500.46
actual self-confidence

5500.92 --> 5507.639
so keep projecting your Anonymous

5505.12 --> 5510.04
[ __ ]

5507.639 --> 5513.400000000001
about what you think

5510.04 --> 5515.199
I should feel bad about myself about you

5513.4 --> 5519.219
know but it's not gonna work it really

5515.199 --> 5521.739
won't work you might piss me off

5519.219 --> 5524.62
but it doesn't actually work

5521.739 --> 5526.718999999999
it's never going to work what you don't

5524.62 --> 5530.139
understand is that people have been

5526.719 --> 5533.44
doing what you do right now as a troll

5530.139 --> 5538.84
in face-to-face situations with entire

5533.44 --> 5543.5199999999995
groups most of my youth yeah

5538.84 --> 5546.6990000000005
I'm used to scumbags like you

5543.52 --> 5549.1
I'm used to it

5546.699 --> 5551.32
in a way it's almost like oh

5549.1 --> 5555.42
it's a bit nostalgic

5551.32 --> 5555.42
having trolls dark me all the time

5555.52 --> 5558.540000000001
weird isn't it

5561.88 --> 5567.58
the only unfortunate difference is that

5564.34 --> 5569.9800000000005
unlike back then in the school days I

5567.58 --> 5572.5599999999995
can't literally punch these bastards in

5569.98 --> 5574.78
the face so the guy could definitely do

5572.56 --> 5579.0
face to face back then

5574.78 --> 5579.0
and half on some occasion

5579.58 --> 5584.38
they also wear small hats

5582.82 --> 5586.679999999999
uh

5584.38 --> 5588.04
there's a chance to that yeah

5586.68 --> 5590.950000000001
[Music]

5588.04 --> 5594.46
no guarantee though

5590.95 --> 5597.76
[Music]

5594.46 --> 5600.219
I mean I'm not even like anti-jew or

5597.76 --> 5603.6990000000005
anything at all I mean pretty open about

5600.219 --> 5605.44
my Semitic neutral stance

5603.699 --> 5608.799999999999
and

5605.44 --> 5608.799999999999
actually appreciation

5609.4 --> 5616.48
in that sense kind of like Owen Benjamin

5611.86 --> 5618.46
but maybe yeah slightly different

5616.48 --> 5620.44
so

5618.46 --> 5623.219
brother had some beautiful long hair too

5620.44 --> 5623.219
had okay

5625.239 --> 5629.5599999999995
yeah I think that my half-brother didn't

5627.28 --> 5633.42
fare all that well last time I saw him

5629.56 --> 5633.42
he cut it and because it yeah

5634.6 --> 5639.4800000000005
it didn't work for out for him it did

5636.94 --> 5639.48
with me

5642.28 --> 5645.12
uh

5654.639 --> 5658.9800000000005
you were the only one he trusted with

5656.56 --> 5658.9800000000005
scissors

5659.38 --> 5662.04
right

5663.94 --> 5669.299999999999
the last person that cut my hair was my

5667.12 --> 5669.3
mother

5669.82 --> 5674.46
that's the last person I actually

5671.5 --> 5674.46
trusted with that

5676.3 --> 5684.06
and so yeah that that was like in 2005.

5681.46 --> 5684.06
in a while

5687.699 --> 5692.58
neutral cement no notes Semitic neutral

5693.1 --> 5699.46
not neutral submitting Semitic neutral

5695.98 --> 5700.709999999999
right that way you can interpret it in

5699.46 --> 5704.97
however you like

5700.71 --> 5704.97
[Music]

5710.86 --> 5714.179
oh Jesus

5717.71 --> 5721.31
[Music]

5733.44 --> 5740.159
no but I don't think so I I don't think

5736.48 --> 5742.199
that a lot of these trolls are actually

5740.159 --> 5745.96
like

5742.199 --> 5748.719
judaic I don't think so

5745.96 --> 5752.32
I mean some of them might be like

5748.719 --> 5755.44
kids or something from really disgusting

5752.32 --> 5757.299999999999
tyrants that know like oh yeah my

5755.44 --> 5759.5199999999995
parents are [ __ ] evil they're trying

5757.3 --> 5761.4400000000005
to kill everybody I'm probably gonna die

5759.52 --> 5763.84
because of this so I have to fight it

5761.44 --> 5766.0
desperately desperately Fight The

5763.84 --> 5768.400000000001
Awakening because otherwise everybody I

5766.0 --> 5771.699
know is gonna die which is not an

5768.4 --> 5773.86
unrealistic Prospect by the way yeah

5771.699 --> 5779.4
huh

5773.86 --> 5783.88
so I think a lot of them are just like

5779.4 --> 5785.86
wef kids and [ __ ] really I really think

5783.88 --> 5788.92
that is more likely than that they're

5785.86 --> 5792.699
just Jews or something right

5788.92 --> 5795.9
because I don't think Jews even really

5792.699 --> 5795.9
despise me that much

5796.12 --> 5800.34
I I don't see why they would

5806.02 --> 5811.96
hey drunken bullet yeah I did I did get

5809.08 --> 5814.0
a PayPal that was great I can always use

5811.96 --> 5816.639
more though I mean I really do need it

5814.0 --> 5819.699
so

5816.639 --> 5823.84
if you can help out that would be well

5819.699 --> 5826.379999999999
extremely helpful and put my heart to

5823.84 --> 5826.38
rest a bit

5827.739 --> 5831.599999999999

5838.42 --> 5841.62
welcome back by the way

5842.02 --> 5846.820000000001
right so there is going to be a flat

5844.06 --> 5848.77

5846.82 --> 5850.96

5881.02 --> 5884.46
like 10 minutes ago

5890.199 --> 5892.678999999999
it sucks

5900.58 --> 5906.58
yeah it seems like LSG is like in a

5903.88 --> 5908.679
similar package

5906.58 --> 5910.719
every year

5908.679 --> 5913.2390000000005
okay

5910.719 --> 5915.1
well

5913.239 --> 5917.799999999999
I'll try to

5915.1 --> 5921.0
get through with well anything you guys

5917.8 --> 5921.0
can still throw at me

5921.4 --> 5926.98
and hopefully yeah the the vacuum is

5924.4 --> 5928.48
gonna end for you guys too I mean it's

5926.98 --> 5930.159
not going to be pleasant for you being

5928.48 --> 5932.638999999999
in that position either

5930.159 --> 5932.638999999999
so

5938.26 --> 5942.820000000001
at least I did not

5940.12 --> 5947.5599999999995
be to pay what the [ __ ] what do you mean

5942.82 --> 5951.94
zap tappy dude my rent went up

5947.56 --> 5954.280000000001
60 Euros per month because of the

5951.94 --> 5955.659
freaking bills of electricity and gas

5954.28 --> 5960.42
okay

5955.659 --> 5960.42
and it's not going away that's permanent

5960.58 --> 5965.98
what are you talking about I didn't have

5962.38 --> 5968.9400000000005
to pay I do have to pay

5965.98 --> 5968.94
it's part of the problem

5971.26 --> 5977.280000000001

19 Euro in November and then again in

5987.82 --> 5991.92
December from the gov yeah that's really

5989.62 --> 5991.92
cute

5993.159 --> 5998.98
it's really cute

5995.8 --> 6001.8
yeah it's not sufficient to cover the

5998.98 --> 6005.12
extra cost that I've had including the

6001.8 --> 6005.12
cost of food going up

6005.219 --> 6008.54
pretty dramatically

6009.9 --> 6016.32
I mean the prices now are like almost

6013.199 --> 6020.46
one and a half times what it used to be

6016.32 --> 6022.32
last year do you realize that

6020.46 --> 6024.54
your rent went up as well well then

6022.32 --> 6027.36
don't say that then

6024.54 --> 6030.0199999999995
be the electric bill yeah we did

6027.36 --> 6030.0199999999995
I did

6033.84 --> 6038.219
all right LG glad you can get around

6035.94 --> 6041.759999999999
like that

6038.219 --> 6044.28
I mean it's admirable

6041.76 --> 6047.46
and in arguably in the Netherlands

6044.28 --> 6050.639
almost completely impossible

6047.46 --> 6051.84
I mean you don't make enough money to

6050.639 --> 6054.96
get around

6051.84 --> 6056.82
from jobs you can't

6054.96 --> 6059.28
like most people here that have even

6056.82 --> 6061.739
have jobs still have some kind of weird

6059.28 --> 6065.9
form of welfare next to that because you

6061.739 --> 6065.9
just can't get around with it anymore

6067.26 --> 6070.1
it's crazy

6118.679 --> 6123.119

6121.08 --> 6126.32
I actually think that's still cheaper

6123.119 --> 6126.32
than over here LSG

6126.659 --> 6129.199
really

6133.92 --> 6139.86
I get my eggs per 4.

6136.739 --> 6142.04
and that cost me like 3 Euro 50 or

6139.86 --> 6142.04
something

6143.34 --> 6151.26
yeah you'll get a dozen that's 12 for 8

6148.98 --> 6154.94

6151.26 --> 6158.58
what's three yo okay well that's a

6154.94 --> 6161.36
dramatic price hike Jesus

[Music]

6165.54 --> 6168.86
it's not good either way

6174.659 --> 6178.08
I don't test the most expensive food

6176.639 --> 6180.0
yeah I know

6178.08 --> 6182.639
I know is that that it's always been

6180.0 --> 6185.1
relatively expensive but it's just going

6182.639 --> 6187.1990000000005
insane now it's unbalanced

6185.1 --> 6191.46
right I mean

6187.199 --> 6194.96
regular welfare has not gone up you

6191.46 --> 6198.26
understand like nothing

6194.96 --> 6198.26
zero up

6198.5 --> 6203.76
the way it's it's divine yeah it's

6201.54 --> 6205.199
arranged now with like social welfare

6203.76 --> 6207.3
the basic

6205.199 --> 6209.759999999999
you cannot get around with it even

6207.3 --> 6213.6
though that was the original

6209.76 --> 6216.96
primary objective of the entire concept

6213.6 --> 6219.679
now you cannot get around with it it's

6216.96 --> 6219.679
not possible

6221.04 --> 6224.719
you're literally gonna starve

6225.17 --> 6229.7390000000005

6227.34 --> 6233.46
also but yeah I know

6229.739 --> 6236.159
it's it's beyond insanely Criminal

6233.46 --> 6239.28
I mean seriously these people that are

6236.159 --> 6241.679
doing this in the government they need

6239.28 --> 6244.98
serious Justice

6241.679 --> 6248.84
potentially execution I mean it they

6244.98 --> 6252.119
need to pay so hard

6248.84 --> 6255.06
so freaking hard

6252.119 --> 6258.599999999999
that any future generation out there

6255.06 --> 6261.659000000001
will literally quiver and cry

6258.6 --> 6263.76
on the idea that they would try that

6261.659 --> 6266.638999999999
ever again

6263.76 --> 6270.179
it needs to be snuffed out that Roots

6266.639 --> 6273.78
dug out forever

6270.179 --> 6277.88
and that goes accompanied with very very

6273.78 --> 6277.88
serious capital punishment

[Music]

6281.4 --> 6286.0199999999995
right I mean

6283.739 --> 6288.659
it's just a matter of how

6286.02 --> 6292.56
well one way we could do it is simply

6288.659 --> 6294.54
deliver arrest these politicians and

6292.56 --> 6296.34
then deliver them

6294.54 --> 6299.5199999999995
to Russia

6296.34 --> 6302.46
for war crime trials

6299.52 --> 6305.280000000001
pretty sure they will be executed

6302.46 --> 6307.7390000000005
there right because they don't have this

6305.28 --> 6310.44
stupid weenie laws

6307.739 --> 6312.78
our capital punishment is outlawed yeah

6310.44 --> 6316.159
so I'm all for that

6312.78 --> 6320.46
yeah put them on a big present plane

6316.159 --> 6324.36
send them over to Russia here you go

6320.46 --> 6327.06
do with them whatever the [ __ ] you want

6324.36 --> 6329.94
yeah these are the people that that

6327.06 --> 6334.159000000001
pushed all that [ __ ] that caused all

6329.94 --> 6334.159
your thousands of soldiers to die

6345.239 --> 6351.178999999999
yeah easy rest Dad I know

6348.48 --> 6354.5
it is a Nazi puppet the day literally

6351.179 --> 6354.5
yeah it's literally that

6355.38 --> 6361.7390000000005
they conjured him there he's an agent he

6358.679 --> 6363.2390000000005
is the Hitler of our era the pretty weak

6361.739 --> 6367.5199999999995
one

6363.239 --> 6367.5199999999995
very weak person he's a weak person

6368.34 --> 6372.2390000000005
Hitler was actually a real Soldier and

6371.28 --> 6376.5
all that

6372.239 --> 6379.32
that man had experience he went insane

6376.5 --> 6382.02
probably likely

6379.32 --> 6385.08
but at least he was actually a leader

6382.02 --> 6387.06
this guy is nothing but a puppet he

6385.08 --> 6389.5199999999995
doesn't have any real qualifications

6387.06 --> 6392.04
other than acting and playing along with

6389.52 --> 6394.56
the propaganda that's his only real

6392.04 --> 6397.56
qualification the guy is a [ __ ] joke

6394.56 --> 6399.42
that's not a leader

6397.56 --> 6403.1990000000005
he's an actor

6399.42 --> 6406.46
and he's leading that entire country

6403.199 --> 6409.5599999999995
to its death

6406.46 --> 6412.94
literally I mean there's more Ukrainian

6409.56 --> 6416.159000000001
soldiers dying than Russian ones okay

6412.94 --> 6418.4
Lots there's not gonna be anybody left

6416.159 --> 6418.4
there

6419.4 --> 6425.04
yeah the entire

6422.179 --> 6427.219
Ukrainian military is going to be

6425.04 --> 6429.16
completely wiped out

6427.219 --> 6432.649
completely wiped off

6429.16 --> 6432.648999999999
[Music]

6435.36 --> 6441.659
right yeah and if Europeans oh no we're

6438.96 --> 6444.9
gonna send our own soldiers now oh yeah

6441.659 --> 6447.619
well then you really you really start

6444.9 --> 6450.36
the [ __ ] happening and that's when

6447.619 --> 6453.119
missiles are going to fly into Europe

6450.36 --> 6455.759999999999
and Western Europe and that's when it's

6453.119 --> 6458.46
really gonna [ __ ] happen then so

6455.76 --> 6460.6990000000005
wouldn't do that if I were you

6458.46 --> 6464.94
huh

6460.699 --> 6468.36
yeah just remember citizens if you allow

6464.94 --> 6471.96
your leaders to do such things then you

6468.36 --> 6474.98
literally allow them to declare war on

6471.96 --> 6479.219
you which will bring physical

6474.98 --> 6481.5599999999995
destruction on your cities and people

6479.219 --> 6484.86
yeah it's not going to be Siege anymore

6481.56 --> 6487.080000000001
it's going to be bombs blowing up your

6484.86 --> 6490.94
[ __ ] buildings and houses and

6487.08 --> 6490.94
children then yeah

6493.89 --> 6497.119000000001
[Music]

6500.4 --> 6504.86
if there was a method yeah this is

6505.26 --> 6511.320000000001
although look arguably if he went to

6507.96 --> 6514.08
Argentina afterward which I think I

6511.32 --> 6516.719
think he let a double a female double

6514.08 --> 6519.3
take over for him

6516.719 --> 6520.619
which was the person that truly screwed

6519.3 --> 6521.820000000001
it up

6520.619 --> 6525.239
I think

6521.82 --> 6527.88
I don't even know if Hitler was on that

6525.239 --> 6529.5
I think it was the lesbian double that

6527.88 --> 6531.719
took over that was actually the math

6529.5 --> 6533.76
addict and that that was part of her

6531.719 --> 6536.76
conditioning training

6533.76 --> 6538.9800000000005
to keep her absolutely in control

6536.76 --> 6541.56
to do everything they said

6538.98 --> 6543.239
while the real Hitler actually went to

6541.56 --> 6547.7390000000005
South America so there's actually a good

6543.239 --> 6550.32
chance he did actually get into Coke

6547.739 --> 6555.379999999999
there is actually a chance that he did

6550.32 --> 6555.38
but this in an important Side Track

6561.36 --> 6566.699
uh drunken don't bother like if you're

6564.659 --> 6570.5599999999995
seeing it it's that

6566.699 --> 6570.5599999999995
just outright ban him

6570.78 --> 6575.4
if you see it's obviously a troll and

6573.54 --> 6577.0199999999995
then so don't be too trigger happy but

6575.4 --> 6579.92
wait you see like that's obviously a

6577.02 --> 6579.92
truly just kick him

6580.98 --> 6585.239
you know what I'm talking about

6583.739 --> 6587.419999999999
anyway

6585.239 --> 6590.4
if you're lucky because I'm located

6587.42 --> 6595.34
there's no [ __ ] nukes dude there is

6590.4 --> 6595.339999999999
no nuke you dumbass doesn't exist

6596.52 --> 6600.360000000001
yeah and they're not gonna drop it in

6598.679 --> 6604.76
the middle of the Netherlands that's

6600.36 --> 6604.759999999999
[ __ ] why the [ __ ] would they do that

6605.34 --> 6610.5
yeah if they're gonna drop it

6607.5 --> 6613.32
they're gonna drop it on threats

6610.5 --> 6616.139
so military bases

6613.32 --> 6618.119
those are gonna get it

6616.139 --> 6620.119
the middle of the Netherlands this is

6618.119 --> 6623.4
literally only

6620.119 --> 6625.619
residential area

6623.4 --> 6627.86
there's nothing why the [ __ ] would he do

6625.619 --> 6627.86
that

6630.119 --> 6633.0
Russia doesn't do that type of stuff

6631.98 --> 6636.239
yeah

6633.0 --> 6639.9
if you want to look for bombarding

6636.239 --> 6642.959999999999
people burning them alive you might want

6639.9 --> 6647.219
to look at America yeah United States

6642.96 --> 6648.719
they do that yeah England they do that

6647.219 --> 6652.56
yeah

6648.719 --> 6653.94
England yeah completely Fire Bomb

6652.56 --> 6657.06
Dresden

6653.94 --> 6660.839999999999
yeah it's not Russia that did that that

6657.06 --> 6664.619000000001
was England yeah Vietnam

6660.84 --> 6667.8
like napalming the [ __ ] out of a giant

6664.619 --> 6670.739
regions yeah that's America that did

6667.8 --> 6673.400000000001
that not Russia America

6670.739 --> 6673.4
get it

6676.73 --> 6681.0599999999995
[Music]

6678.199 --> 6683.4
Russia doesn't operate that way

6681.06 --> 6686.780000000001
I mean not even the freaking Soviet

6683.4 --> 6686.78
Union did that sort of thing

6690.0 --> 6695.189
[Music]

6698.34 --> 6702.0
you don't think they all attacked it now

6699.84 --> 6704.6
why the hell would they

6702.0 --> 6708.239
Netherlands is very

6704.6 --> 6712.4400000000005
Progressive country actually we're just

6708.239 --> 6715.08
taken over by communist infiltrators

6712.44 --> 6717.178999999999
that are trying to turn it into a Soviet

6715.08 --> 6719.639
Union

6717.179 --> 6722.1
right I mean if anything I think that

6719.639 --> 6724.26
Russians will probably sympathize with

6722.1 --> 6726.659000000001
our situation because it is so similar

6724.26 --> 6729.7390000000005
as to what their parents and

6726.659 --> 6729.739
grandparents went through

6730.56 --> 6736.080000000001
we could actually probably get some good

6733.679 --> 6738.8
advice about how to deal with this

6736.08 --> 6742.73
situation from Russians

6738.8 --> 6744.6
from like the regular folk there

6742.73 --> 6747.98
[Music]

6744.6 --> 6747.9800000000005
if you ever consider that

6760.02 --> 6765.6
anyway yeah time has flown it's been a

6763.139 --> 6768.84
very interesting show today

6765.6 --> 6773.2390000000005
more than just about robots

6768.84 --> 6773.2390000000005
but uh that's where it started

6773.88 --> 6778.639
without anyone really win a war yeah

6776.1 --> 6778.639
bankers

6779.34 --> 6783.56
they win a war they win all wars

6784.44 --> 6790.138999999999
because War means business during the

6787.26 --> 6794.179
war after the war so yeah

6790.139 --> 6794.179
Bankers always win Wars

6794.52 --> 6799.38
