I don't get any today

or before tomorrow's show I'm not doing

96.54 --> 99.97900000000001
a show until I do

100.74 --> 106.079
because I'm gonna be completely dead out

103.92 --> 108.84
of food tomorrow

106.079 --> 109.69999999999999
all right

108.84 --> 112.5
all right

109.7 --> 114.42
so yeah the weather today is kind of

112.5 --> 117.119
nice

114.42 --> 120.899
it's a lot of trails around though that

117.119 --> 124.439
seem to be ruining it a bit hazing it up

120.899 --> 128.22
but beside that it's kind of a really

124.439 --> 130.619
blue sky no actual clouds lots of sun

128.22 --> 134.7
very little wind

130.619 --> 136.68
so it did actually warm up a lot

134.7 --> 141.44
really nice

136.68 --> 141.44
mint plant is just crushing it

141.9 --> 147.18
the rosemary plant is

144.0 --> 149.9
blossoming some more

147.18 --> 149.9
it's pretty awesome

152.819 --> 155.29999999999998
right

160.08 --> 163.98000000000002
hello Richard G first in chat good to

163.019 --> 169.62
see you

163.98 --> 169.61999999999998
it is Monday the 4th of September 2023

174.44 --> 181.07999999999998
temperature 24 degrees Celsius all right

178.98 --> 184.319
wow according to this it's going to be

181.08 --> 186.86
all Sunny until Friday

184.319 --> 186.85999999999999
cool

186.959 --> 192.12
well I guess maybe it will be

190.26 --> 195.85999999999999
I mean today's a lot warmer than was

192.12 --> 195.86
yesterday a lot warmer

196.26 --> 202.04
degrees or something right anyway I'm

198.599 --> 202.04
starting late today this Monday

202.62 --> 209.159
because I'm a little bit wonky

205.26 --> 211.92
from yesterday I'll explain later

209.159 --> 215.7
and Nathan's not doing a fbd live show

211.92 --> 219.54
there's some holiday again

215.7 --> 221.959
so I start a little later and I can just

219.54 --> 221.959
keep going

222.959 --> 229.14000000000001
right but yeah I'm a little wonky

225.48 --> 231.92
because I I drank some beer yesterday

229.14 --> 231.92
ugh

233.94 --> 238.739
I can't believe that like not even a

236.099 --> 240.42
year ago I would drink beer every day I

238.739 --> 244.379
can't believe it

240.42 --> 246.29899999999998
how did I pull it off

244.379 --> 249.599
oh man

246.299 --> 252.0
I'm so not used to it anymore and I mean

249.599 --> 255.599
it was kind of fun so what happened is

252.0 --> 258.72
that it told everybody I think on at the

255.599 --> 260.639
end of my show yesterday I was invited

258.72 --> 264.78000000000003
to some

260.639 --> 266.34000000000003
little party that was like or like off

264.78 --> 268.55999999999995
the building basically like everybody

266.34 --> 270.78
that's in this building

268.56 --> 273.06
they have this tradition of doing that

270.78 --> 276.71999999999997
every year

273.06 --> 278.759
around this date like the first Sunday

276.72 --> 280.97900000000004
in September or something I don't know

278.759 --> 282.06
exactly I haven't really asked to that

280.979 --> 285.18
detail

282.06 --> 288.419
but yeah I was sort of invited by

285.18 --> 291.6
somebody there that I bumped into

288.419 --> 294.24
and yeah I thought like I'm gonna go I

291.6 --> 295.8
like I wanna go I want to meet these

294.24 --> 299.28000000000003
people I want to see if this is going to

295.8 --> 303.18
be good and here's the funny thing

299.28 --> 306.17999999999995
I had another Dark World memory about it

303.18 --> 308.52
that went completely to [ __ ]

306.18 --> 311.88
and that didn't happen at all

308.52 --> 314.94
just like with the 2019 conference and I

311.88 --> 317.04
even told you guys about it then

314.94 --> 318.62
that like wow there were all these

317.04 --> 322.32
things

318.62 --> 325.02
that I didn't end up doing

322.32 --> 327.36
that it had this Vision about well the

325.02 --> 330.06
same thing was about this meeting

327.36 --> 332.82
so weird

330.06 --> 335.6
it's like I had this entire memory of

332.82 --> 337.979
how like how it would basically go wrong

335.6 --> 340.62
in ways

337.979 --> 342.479
and it didn't it didn't go wrong at all

340.62 --> 344.46
it was great

342.479 --> 347.94
and YouTube

344.46 --> 351.73999999999995
is freezing my video again Let me

347.94 --> 351.74
refresh ah yeah it's just

352.68 --> 355.52
it's just my

355.86 --> 360.96000000000004
browser

358.5 --> 363.3
right but it went great it went so

360.96 --> 366.539
freaking great actually that I basically

363.3 --> 369.36
broke Flat Earth through all of them

366.539 --> 371.88
and I confronted a girl that worked in a

369.36 --> 373.02000000000004
medical laboratory and kept basically

371.88 --> 377.15999999999997
pushing

373.02 --> 379.44
was a bit mean but I I didn't get

377.16 --> 382.139
aggressive or anything but I kept like

379.44 --> 384.8
where where did you actually apply cost

382.139 --> 384.8
postulate

385.919 --> 391.58
but she was researching Lyme disease

388.919 --> 394.5
and then it was claimed that certain

391.58 --> 397.08
borrelia bacteria

394.5 --> 398.759
would be the cause of that so then I

397.08 --> 400.34
immediately with all my background

398.759 --> 403.259
knowledge

400.34 --> 405.78
like oh really so how do you know that

403.259 --> 408.3
that bacteria actually causes it has it

405.78 --> 411.96
has it been tested

408.3 --> 414.06
and she like well no you can't just test

411.96 --> 415.73999999999995
it all we have to just rely on the

414.06 --> 419.28000000000003
literature

415.74 --> 423.06
and then I was like uh so what if I told

419.28 --> 425.34
you that nobody has ever applied it

423.06 --> 428.4
with any of the diseases

425.34 --> 431.039
that it's just correlatory

428.4 --> 432.539
like oh somebody has the disease oh they

431.039 --> 434.039
have the bacteria

432.539 --> 436.039
hmm

434.039 --> 439.44
bacteria seems to cause these poison

436.039 --> 441.96
poison is associated with the disease so

439.44 --> 445.38
they must cause the disease yeah well

441.96 --> 448.19899999999996
what if the disease causes them

445.38 --> 451.74
that's why you need cause postulate to

448.199 --> 453.0
take the isolated bacterial clean out no

451.74 --> 456.02
toxins

453.0 --> 458.52
you put it in the body of the person

456.02 --> 460.56
injected into their bloodstream or into

458.52 --> 462.599
their flesh if necessary or something

460.56 --> 465.479
depending of course

462.599 --> 468.9
and then see if the Raw

465.479 --> 471.06
cleaned bacteria that are alive causes

468.9 --> 473.15999999999997
that disease

471.06 --> 476.16
I guarantee they won't

473.16 --> 476.16
foreign

479.58 --> 484.8
frauded with his original postulate I

482.4 --> 486.9
never even got to that but they didn't

484.8 --> 488.819
need to because after I'd explained this

486.9 --> 490.67999999999995
like when did you apply it you're just

488.819 --> 493.02000000000004
trusting on literature but it's never

490.68 --> 494.16
actually been tested did you realize

493.02 --> 496.919
that

494.16 --> 499.94
and she got really like

496.919 --> 502.56
worried and broody about that afterward

499.94 --> 505.8
I like I stopped nagging her and she

502.56 --> 508.62
just like okay okay I just do laboratory

505.8 --> 510.72
work he was really a like not being like

508.62 --> 513.36
hey what the hell are you talking about

510.72 --> 516.1800000000001
she was like whoa uh

513.36 --> 519.899
okay and what's kind of Broody about it

516.18 --> 523.7399999999999
afterwards like like oh [ __ ]

519.899 --> 525.839
like that's something she did not expect

523.74 --> 527.76
at all

525.839 --> 529.08
so because she was just very comfortable

527.76 --> 532.22
I was like yeah it's just a really good

529.08 --> 535.08
paying job of course it's all real

532.22 --> 536.64
so that's how it kind of started I met

535.08 --> 539.5400000000001
some of the neighbors that I'm familiar

536.64 --> 539.54
with by face

539.76 --> 545.16
and it all kind of clicked they all kind

541.86 --> 546.54
of liked me nobody was like Ugh that guy

545.16 --> 547.98
some

546.54 --> 552.0
perhaps

547.98 --> 557.0600000000001
but they were like nervous about it like

552.0 --> 557.06
they knew they couldn't push against me

558.12 --> 562.86
if the group dynamic would have been

560.339 --> 564.5400000000001
different they probably would have but

562.86 --> 567.36
that didn't happen

564.54 --> 570.48
so I was like scot-free there and it was

567.36 --> 573.24
very restrained even with the beers and

570.48 --> 575.399
all that so it just had

573.24 --> 578.1
a total of

575.399 --> 580.76
one and a half liters

578.1 --> 580.76
no wait

581.339 --> 587.7600000000001
no three it's not even a leader

585.24 --> 589.98
but still I feel wonky from it but yeah

587.76 --> 592.019
I got into a conversation I explained

589.98 --> 594.0600000000001
there were several women the women

592.019 --> 597.12
seemed particularly interested

594.06 --> 599.399
guess wonder why that would be

597.12 --> 602.0
maybe because I'm kind of attractive and

599.399 --> 602.0
really smart

603.899 --> 607.86
but they heard me out about like what do

606.12 --> 609.54
we do with the show I was wearing my

607.86 --> 612.72
Early Bird shirt I got from steamy

609.54 --> 614.8199999999999
Travelers are showing it off

612.72 --> 617.399
and they asked me a few questions like

614.82 --> 619.6800000000001
but how do you know what about those

617.399 --> 620.519
pictures from space and then I explained

619.68 --> 623.0999999999999
like

620.519 --> 626.279
second law of Thermodynamics how it

623.1 --> 628.32
cannot be like that and like why there's

626.279 --> 630.42
a gas pressure gradient here because of

628.32 --> 632.7600000000001
likely temperature influences the only

630.42 --> 635.279
thing that we can test to demonstrate

632.76 --> 639.42
any kind of gradation within a container

635.279 --> 642.8389999999999
right so I explained that pretty rapidly

639.42 --> 646.019
and then explain how NASA is actually

642.839 --> 648.12
secretly a religion

646.019 --> 649.86
and they're a priesthood that knowingly

648.12 --> 652.5
lies

649.86 --> 654.899
and gives falsehoods to uphold a

652.5 --> 657.54
fictional area that doesn't actually

654.899 --> 660.12
exist so they have absolute power

657.54 --> 662.9399999999999
because it doesn't exist nobody else can

660.12 --> 665.94
do anything with it

662.94 --> 667.9200000000001
and that fascinated all of them

665.94 --> 669.72
and then I proceeded to explain like

667.92 --> 671.399
where it all came from like yeah this

669.72 --> 674.76
actually comes from the Catholic church

671.399 --> 676.98
because I think that Catholic I rolled

674.76 --> 678.48
it out a little easier but basically

676.98 --> 680.22
explaining how I thought the Catholic

678.48 --> 683.3000000000001
church is actually

680.22 --> 686.5790000000001
the Antichrist church that

683.3 --> 688.9799999999999
absorbed Christianity wiped out the

686.579 --> 691.399
original one and then like rolled out

688.98 --> 693.66
all this distracted

691.399 --> 695.82
diluted things

693.66 --> 697.56
and that still the people would be

695.82 --> 700.1400000000001
Christians within it

697.56 --> 701.64
and be good relatively good Christians

700.14 --> 703.74
even though they got a lot of like

701.64 --> 706.079
deviated material they would still try

703.74 --> 708.36
to do good so that not everybody in it

706.079 --> 710.399
is bad but that the top is like provably

708.36 --> 715.26
bad and they literally

710.399 --> 717.72
send out people the Jesuits long ago to

715.26 --> 720.24
destroy other religions and Destroy

717.72 --> 722.519
information about

720.24 --> 726.0
the Flat Earth

722.519 --> 728.94
which all ancient cultures had

726.0 --> 731.76
just so they could on the long term plan

728.94 --> 734.4590000000001
create the ball religion

731.76 --> 736.2
and then not have all the religions in

734.459 --> 739.3199999999999
the past counter it

736.2 --> 741.839
say like no no no it's it's flat see

739.32 --> 745.6800000000001
here's the exact writing like no no then

741.839 --> 747.6600000000001
now it's all ambiguous or sort of vague

745.68 --> 749.2199999999999
there's some hints but not really

747.66 --> 751.079
sufficient

749.22 --> 752.88
that's how it is now thanks to the

751.079 --> 756.12
Jesuits going around

752.88 --> 759.36
what is it 500 years ago or something

756.12 --> 763.079
so yeah I roll out a pretty full picture

759.36 --> 764.7
and they were all like wow

763.079 --> 767.399
curious

764.7 --> 770.82
a bit overwhelmed but curious

767.399 --> 773.88
I bet they're gonna ask me more

770.82 --> 776.72
so yeah it was great I think I might be

773.88 --> 776.72
sort of popular

779.16 --> 783.3
and I asked they had no they have

781.56 --> 786.0
absolutely no complaints about my

783.3 --> 787.9799999999999
smoking or about sound

786.0 --> 790.62
they did have complaints about some

787.98 --> 793.44
other person and who didn't show up

790.62 --> 797.3
who apparently like smokes really big

793.44 --> 797.3000000000001
joints at five in the morning

798.0 --> 804.36
it's really weird to do it at that time

801.68 --> 806.579
but uh yeah that's like on the other

804.36 --> 808.2
side of this building so yeah that was

806.579 --> 810.7399999999999
basically

808.2 --> 810.74
yesterday

811.32 --> 815.36
I got a phone number from a girl

816.12 --> 822.019
is one of the women in the building

818.82 --> 822.019
she is really nice

823.279 --> 827.9399999999999
like I I feel that I can be friends with

826.44 --> 830.82
her

827.94 --> 832.5600000000001
maybe more but definitely friends I

830.82 --> 836.399
don't know if there's like I don't think

832.56 --> 839.4799999999999
she's like real family material although

836.399 --> 839.48
you never really know

841.98 --> 847.16
but yeah

844.079 --> 847.16
that went really well

848.7 --> 853.76
hello again the question like that

854.279 --> 859.32
Eric Dubai the real do is what he says

857.339 --> 862.019
tour

859.32 --> 865.6800000000001
I don't know is what Eric Dubey says

862.019 --> 867.779
tour yeah I know you've been true but uh

865.68 --> 870.079
yeah not everything Eric Dubey says is

867.779 --> 870.079
true

870.66 --> 875.639
I'd say

872.82 --> 877.86
three quarters of what he has to say is

875.639 --> 881.12
it's very decent

877.86 --> 884.519
and a quarter is absolute horseshit

881.12 --> 887.839
that's just really

884.519 --> 887.839
poorly sourced

894.06 --> 898.579
so

895.26 --> 898.579
does that answer it

898.68 --> 903.3599999999999
I mean his overall Flat Earth videos

901.199 --> 905.459
have a lot of

903.36 --> 908.519
of the good explanations and then he

905.459 --> 910.0189999999999
inserts some weird [ __ ] that's just

908.519 --> 912.779
like

910.019 --> 915.3
it doesn't belong in the set of

912.779 --> 918.3
long-term super durable

915.3 --> 920.279
explanations and arguments

918.3 --> 922.26
that's why I say three quarters of what

920.279 --> 927.12
he talks about is pretty good the other

922.26 --> 930.18
quarter is weird and nonsensical

927.12 --> 933.62
like his story about the ties being

930.18 --> 936.12
caused by water being sucked in some

933.62 --> 938.22
breathing room

936.12 --> 940.68
in the bottom of the ocean and then

938.22 --> 943.1990000000001
going in and out that's absolutely not

940.68 --> 946.7399999999999
happening that's provably not happening

943.199 --> 948.24
yet he keeps repeating that story

946.74 --> 950.76
for years

948.24 --> 953.5790000000001
he always kept that in and it makes no

950.76 --> 955.38
sense whatsoever and I know where he got

953.579 --> 957.2399999999999
it it's like certain references from

955.38 --> 959.639
certain older books

957.24 --> 961.8
and it was complete horseshit in those

959.639 --> 965.12
books too

961.8 --> 965.12
arguably fiction

966.68 --> 971.579
uh I don't need to do anything

969.6 --> 974.639
Le Max

971.579 --> 978.12
hired hoodlum you'd you don't need to

974.639 --> 980.639
tell me what I need to do

978.12 --> 983.4590000000001
newcomer

980.639 --> 986.519
people that hang around every day

983.459 --> 987.779
for years they don't get to tell me what

986.519 --> 989.82
to do

987.779 --> 992.279
and the newcomer that just suddenly

989.82 --> 994.94
shows up certainly doesn't get to tell

992.279 --> 994.9399999999999
me what to do

995.459 --> 1000.2589999999999
so I'm not gonna make a video about the

998.04 --> 1002.5
India moon landing is barely worth a

1000.259 --> 1002.5
mention

1002.839 --> 1005.62
to me

1005.74 --> 1011.1800000000001
besides I don't do videos about

1009.68 --> 1013.9399999999999
something

1011.18 --> 1014.959
that everybody else is going to do a

1013.94 --> 1018.0790000000001
video about

1014.959 --> 1019.9399999999999
I mean what what am I gonna do just oh

1018.079 --> 1021.7399999999999
look here's some footage oh look at how

1019.94 --> 1024.8600000000001
ridiculous that is

1021.74 --> 1027.38
oh look hear me talking about

1024.86 --> 1030.04
why it's wrong

1027.38 --> 1032.72
oh what like another

1030.04 --> 1035.6599999999999
thousand Flat Earth videos that do

1032.72 --> 1040.339
exactly that with more video assist and

1035.66 --> 1042.439
all that no no I don't

1040.339 --> 1045.4389999999999
I don't do that

1042.439 --> 1048.459
that you check my channel it's not how

1045.439 --> 1048.459
my channel works

1049.9 --> 1058.1000000000001
yeah Eric Dube makes themed videos

1054.62 --> 1059.4189999999999
and he's good at it I don't

1058.1 --> 1062.6599999999999
with me

1059.419 --> 1065.72
you're just gonna have to bump into the

1062.66 --> 1069.919
conversation about it or you ask me live

1065.72 --> 1072.32
and then I give you my answer live just

1069.919 --> 1075.16
like what I just did

1072.32 --> 1075.1599999999999
La Max

the [ __ ] man

1154.46 --> 1159.14
or are you just a normie yeah that's

1157.58 --> 1162.02
kind of weird to hear yourself being

1159.14 --> 1164.96
called the Normie that just happened to

1162.02 --> 1168.8799999999999
bump into my live stream or something

1164.96 --> 1168.88

okay fair enough

1203.84 --> 1209.72
sorry if I can be a bit judgmental it's

1206.48 --> 1213.1
just that I'm I'm used to not giving a

1209.72 --> 1213.1000000000001
[ __ ] this is

1214.16 --> 1218.059
like I'll even do that to my best

1216.38 --> 1219.5
friends

1218.059 --> 1223.059
and they can

1219.5 --> 1223.059
like testify to that

1223.22 --> 1226.22
right

1240.32 --> 1244.8999999999999
run into a financial wall what

1249.02 --> 1255.1
didn't have anything set up

1252.08 --> 1255.1
oh crap

1256.46 --> 1260.8600000000001
you left a mess oh that sounds good

1261.08 --> 1264.98
any

1262.82 --> 1267.26
indication on how that's going to be

1264.98 --> 1269.179
fixed is it's something that you can do

1267.26 --> 1270.919
anything about

1269.179 --> 1273.22
or is it kind of locked out of your

1270.919 --> 1273.22
hands

1296.72 --> 1304.419
what are you talking about lamox

1300.26 --> 1304.419
don't you dis on Richard G

1309.02 --> 1312.76
hello I'm up here to see you

1315.02 --> 1321.1
you're going to have to borrow money

1318.2 --> 1321.1000000000001
wow

1330.5 --> 1333.44
all right it isn't gonna yeah did you

1332.6 --> 1334.58
read

1333.44 --> 1337.88
oh

1334.58 --> 1340.76
well he said oh all's Richard is gaining

1337.88 --> 1343.159
weight and playing video games poorly

1340.76 --> 1347.86
so that wasn't about Richard G A right

1343.159 --> 1347.8600000000001
here in chat right above that comment

1364.4 --> 1368.1000000000001
I guess it's another Richard he's

1366.26 --> 1371.2
talking about

1368.1 --> 1371.1999999999998
[Music]

1376.34 --> 1379.0
oh

1387.38 --> 1389.98
foreign

1395.059 --> 1399.1399999999999
get the sense Today Show might be a

1397.58 --> 1401.9189999999999
little silly

1399.14 --> 1401.919
but hey

1402.74 --> 1406.58
why not

1404.179 --> 1408.74
yesterday's show was all very very

1406.58 --> 1411.76
esoteric again just like they did

1408.74 --> 1411.76
Saturday so

1412.64 --> 1416.5590000000002
I'm talking about yeah right

1419.299 --> 1425.299
all right can I ask you Lumix like how

1421.4 --> 1427.3400000000001
did you find me I need to find this

1425.299 --> 1430.8799999999999
this live stream that you just bump into

1427.34 --> 1432.9189999999999
it like a random search or like oh

1430.88 --> 1434.9
what's going on at the home page and it

1432.919 --> 1437.48
was there or

1434.9 --> 1441.159
do you know me through another Channel

1437.48 --> 1441.159
or how did you find me

1444.02 --> 1450.34
or God forbid that somebody actually

1446.539 --> 1450.34
shared my show with you

1460.72 --> 1465.6200000000001
[Music]

1462.62 --> 1465.62
foreign

1484.12 --> 1489.4399999999998
okay so what have you been picking up

1487.4 --> 1492.26
for me just randomly watching or is

1489.44 --> 1495.0800000000002
there certain titles that Drew you in or

1492.26 --> 1497.679
certain recommendations of episodes that

1495.08 --> 1497.6789999999999
Drew you in

1497.72 --> 1505.24
because the quality of my shows have

1501.86 --> 1505.24
been varying greatly

1505.82 --> 1511.7
although statistically on average I'd

1508.76 --> 1515.14
say it is definitely the average NP

1511.7 --> 1515.14
quality has improved

1515.9 --> 1521.0
over the years pretty dramatically I

1518.9 --> 1524.3600000000001
mean the first year early bird was

1521.0 --> 1526.94
really kind of lame it really was

1524.36 --> 1529.3999999999999
felt awkward

1526.94 --> 1531.5
like

1529.4 --> 1534.98
I still had feelings like I don't know

1531.5 --> 1536.36
what I'm doing here sort of thing

1534.98 --> 1538.34
right

1536.36 --> 1541.58
I don't have all those issues anymore

1538.34 --> 1544.6999999999998
I'm very fluid I'm very developed

1541.58 --> 1547.6999999999998
I'm much more confident and I'm more

1544.7 --> 1549.98
aware of my ups and downs and writing

1547.7 --> 1552.26
them so if I'm getting it up I'm gonna

1549.98 --> 1554.3600000000001
use it I'm gonna be brilliant

1552.26 --> 1556.539
if I got it down well then I take it

1554.36 --> 1556.539
easy

1558.26 --> 1562.779
and don't worry so much about it

1563.299 --> 1569.17
anyway

1565.95 --> 1569.17
[Music]

1571.039 --> 1575.72
you like my rants oh well I got plenty

1573.5 --> 1579.32
of those

1575.72 --> 1583.179
right thank you thank you now I know I

1579.32 --> 1583.1789999999999
guess my rants are kind of popular

1586.159 --> 1590.2
they are really a stark contrast with

1588.62 --> 1591.5
the rest of what I do

1590.2 --> 1594.44
[Music]

1591.5 --> 1596.96
because when I get angry and I basically

1594.44 --> 1598.159
give in to it I I do I am kind of

1596.96 --> 1603.1000000000001
different

1598.159 --> 1603.1000000000001
as to my calm reserved self

1604.64 --> 1609.76
quite a different type of expression of

1607.34 --> 1609.76
my person

1609.98 --> 1613.779
the guillotine song

1615.32 --> 1621.6399999999999
yeah I get pretty extreme

1618.98 --> 1625.1
when it comes to

1621.64 --> 1627.26
upholding order even though it is I know

1625.1 --> 1629.7199999999998
it's technically irrational it's more

1627.26 --> 1632.779
symbolic in that way it's like I'm

1629.72 --> 1635.299
expressing how I feel it should be done

1632.779 --> 1638.0
I'm not actually gonna argue that it

1635.299 --> 1641.84
should literally be done like that

1638.0 --> 1645.26
because it would make

1641.84 --> 1648.1
it would make it look real very bad to

1645.26 --> 1648.1
the outside world

1648.32 --> 1651.6399999999999
and that's not durable

1654.86 --> 1659.4799999999998
right but although I mean at some point

1657.38 --> 1661.88
it can still happen that like if enough

1659.48 --> 1663.919
[ __ ] goes to [ __ ] it's like

1661.88 --> 1666.44
literally like yeah we're upholding

1663.919 --> 1669.2
we're trying to be the Civilized person

1666.44 --> 1672.38
like yeah but like you don't have any

1669.2 --> 1675.679
more clothes without holes

1672.38 --> 1677.8400000000001
you only eat recycled food and barely

1675.679 --> 1681.02
enough to not faint

1677.84 --> 1684.1
right maybe you don't really have that

1681.02 --> 1684.1
Civilization anymore

1684.799 --> 1690.44
I mean at some point it's gonna be like

1687.2 --> 1691.3400000000001
yeah if you still got some monster in

1690.44 --> 1696.0800000000002
you

1691.34 --> 1700.82
please use it before we're all dead

1696.08 --> 1702.62
as I predicted in the original 82 the

1700.82 --> 1705.6789999999999
first

1702.62 --> 1708.4599999999998
super Insidious rant that I did

1705.679 --> 1708.46
on my channel

1718.039 --> 1725.3799999999999
what are always finds it level okay Oz

1722.9 --> 1725.38
laughs

1726.08 --> 1728.62
uh

1729.26 --> 1733.279
I feel weird

1730.94 --> 1737.5
on one hand I'm hungry on the other hand

1733.279 --> 1737.5
I'm kind of nauseous and not hungry

1737.6 --> 1740.26
it's weird

1754.4 --> 1760.159
right so yeah la Max let's prod a little

1758.12 --> 1763.6999999999998
so where do you stand

1760.159 --> 1766.64
you think Flat Earth is entertaining

1763.7 --> 1768.98
you think Flat Earth is legitimate

1766.64 --> 1771.0200000000002
you think that the struggles legitimate

1768.98 --> 1773.38
what the people are just making a mess

1771.02 --> 1773.3799999999999
of it

1773.899 --> 1779.779
or you you think it's some kind of

1777.679 --> 1782.96
culture that's not real what do you

1779.779 --> 1786.559
think about it oh lumox

1782.96 --> 1789.94
where's your position you on the fence

1786.559 --> 1789.94
are you over the fence

1794.36 --> 1798.86
or are you just there for the

1796.76 --> 1803.5
personalities and you literally ignore

1798.86 --> 1803.5
all information that concerns Flat Earth

1804.799 --> 1807.7
where's your position

1812.48 --> 1817.1200000000001
do you have a position that you would

1814.58 --> 1817.12
like to share

1826.22 --> 1829.22
okay

1833.539 --> 1835.72
foreign

1853.6 --> 1859.4189999999999
battle both sides no it's not going

1856.82 --> 1863.24
completely insane on both sides

1859.419 --> 1865.3990000000001
now Nathan's not going insane at all

1863.24 --> 1868.46
jaron's going insane

1865.399 --> 1872.9799999999998
he's going on a

1868.46 --> 1872.98
[ __ ] to anti-flat earthers tour

1873.559 --> 1878.4189999999999
he keeps doing it

1875.6 --> 1881.1999999999998
that Mac tune episode apparently wasn't

1878.419 --> 1881.2
the only one

1881.419 --> 1886.5200000000002
he keeps getting in conversations with

1884.36 --> 1887.6589999999999
Ballers and then literally like giving

1886.52 --> 1890.12
them

1887.659 --> 1892.0390000000002
Celestial navigation on a ball and such

1890.12 --> 1895.1
like

1892.039 --> 1897.3799999999999
it wasn't just an an odd one out

1895.1 --> 1900.02
apparently he's just doing that now he's

1897.38 --> 1903.64
just going on tour cooking to anti-flat

1900.02 --> 1903.6399999999999
earthers it's really bizarre

1905.96 --> 1911.539
also there's a bit of a rumor gone

1907.94 --> 1912.98
around well it's not a rumor it's proven

1911.539 --> 1916.1
think

1912.98 --> 1920.179
that yeah I don't know if any of you

1916.1 --> 1924.26
caught flat swords yesterday

1920.179 --> 1928.3600000000001
but apparently fight the Flat Earth as

1924.26 --> 1928.36
like violently assaulted somebody

1928.88 --> 1932.2600000000002
in a fit of rage

1933.44 --> 1938.179
like

1935.36 --> 1940.7199999999998
yeah it's in a news article pretty

1938.179 --> 1940.72
freaky

1942.559 --> 1946.46
not gonna read it out

1945.02 --> 1949.399
but I will

1946.46 --> 1952.779
share Nathan's

1949.399 --> 1952.779
video with you

1955.46 --> 1959.72
where there's a robot voice basically

1957.32 --> 1962.72
reading out the article

1959.72 --> 1962.72
wait

1967.22 --> 1970.84
oh okay Richard G

1970.94 --> 1975.14

1973.51 --> 1976.94
[Music]

1975.14 --> 1981.5800000000002
really Oz

1976.94 --> 1981.5800000000002
really so he's cool

1990.74 --> 1995.8990000000001
you believe the Earth Okay so

1993.62 --> 1997.6999999999998
[Music]

1995.899 --> 2001.08
okay this might be a bit of an odd

1997.7 --> 2001.0800000000002
question to you but uh

2002.74 --> 2006.519
how many vaccines did you take as a

2005.14 --> 2012.659
little kid

2006.519 --> 2012.659
do you actually have developed faculties

2020.14 --> 2027.64
or are you not flexible

2024.88 --> 2031.179
as in once you learn something a certain

2027.64 --> 2034.72
way you can't change that anymore are

2031.179 --> 2037.24
you that kind of person because

2034.72 --> 2040.299
I don't know how you can still believe

2037.24 --> 2041.86
the Earth is round and like Flat Earth

2040.299 --> 2046.86
videos

2041.86 --> 2046.86
I mean the argumentation is right there

2047.08 --> 2051.7799999999997
if you follow Nathan Oakley's and you

2050.08 --> 2054.46
listen to the housekeeping questions

2051.78 --> 2057.3
then why the hell would you believe the

2054.46 --> 2057.3
Earth is around

2058.899 --> 2063.6389999999997
wow 62 IQ okay

2068.44 --> 2073.139
are you being sarcastic really

2073.599 --> 2076.32
dang

2080.679 --> 2086.679
all right well yeah then there's not

2083.2 --> 2088.72
much we can probably do about it

2086.679 --> 2089.8
and thank you for being honest by the

2088.72 --> 2094.48
way

2089.8 --> 2097.3
if if you're not actually trolling me

2094.48 --> 2099.52
and according to Oz you're cool

2097.3 --> 2101.82
all seems to be a perfect judge of

2099.52 --> 2101.82
character

2102.94 --> 2108.66
real if they come okay

2106.06 --> 2108.66
all right

2109.48 --> 2114.54
so you're basically a bit of a Peter

2112.119 --> 2114.54
Griffin

2114.839 --> 2118.66
that's fine

2117.099 --> 2121.06
I mean

2118.66 --> 2124.98
at least it's truly internet so you're

2121.06 --> 2124.98
not gonna like Break Stuff

2126.339 --> 2131.5
all right and hey

2129.04 --> 2134.2599999999998
you're a nice guy it seems you don't

2131.5 --> 2135.53
seem to have any real malice in you so I

2134.26 --> 2142.989
I'm fine with that

2135.53 --> 2142.989
[Music]

2144.88 --> 2148.619
TB jab woof

2157.599 --> 2160.1400000000003
right

2180.54 --> 2182.74
yeah

2182.14 --> 2186.22
um

2182.74 --> 2189.839
okay so let's move on

2186.22 --> 2189.839
I did not expect that to happen

2206.02 --> 2208.5
oh

2214.0 --> 2217.78
so

2215.2 --> 2221.14
I might yeah I'm implied to still prompt

2217.78 --> 2223.96
you a little more Lomax so

2221.14 --> 2225.94
do you know the housekeeping questions

2223.96 --> 2228.88
I'm getting very hungry by the way now

2225.94 --> 2231.579
I'm feeling better I'm gonna

2228.88 --> 2234.82
put an illuminatios song

2231.579 --> 2238.079
in the oven be right back and kind of

2234.82 --> 2238.079
get a Gusto drink too

2286.9 --> 2289.619
okay

2298.07 --> 2301.4590000000003
[Music]

2326.32 --> 2329.32
hmm

2333.579 --> 2337.619
pastry every day

2339.099 --> 2344.38
what do you mean

2341.02 --> 2347.14
like an Illuminati or something just one

2344.38 --> 2351.3
every day oh my God

2347.14 --> 2351.2999999999997
uh no that's perfectly fine

2352.599 --> 2357.82
I mean it's it's like a sandwich or

2355.599 --> 2360.1800000000003
something like why would that murder my

2357.82 --> 2360.1800000000003
stomach

2361.48 --> 2363.66
foreign

2364.12 --> 2367.199
[Music]

2367.839 --> 2373.48
right besides I don't drink tea or

2371.5 --> 2376.06
coffee

2373.48 --> 2379.0
so my stomach is doing great my stomach

2376.06 --> 2382.24
yesterday was not doing so great in the

2379.0 --> 2385.3
evening from the beers though

2382.24 --> 2387.52
got kind of sour

2385.3 --> 2391.38
but uh

2387.52 --> 2391.38
no yeah it's doing fine

2394.54 --> 2401.38
I mean if I had if I would drink a

2397.18 --> 2403.96
coffee every time alongside it yeah then

2401.38 --> 2406.3
my stomach would go to hell

2403.96 --> 2408.64
and that's kind of what did happen like

2406.3 --> 2410.619
years ago when I was still doing that on

2408.64 --> 2413.2599999999998
the early bird show

2410.619 --> 2415.3
that's why I stopped drinking coffee and

2413.26 --> 2418.9
then I stopped drinking tea

2415.3 --> 2420.82
and then I stopped drinking beer

2418.9 --> 2423.06
and now I don't have stomach issues

2420.82 --> 2423.06
anymore

2423.76 --> 2428.4
Jesus

2425.5 --> 2428.4
at least G

2434.8 --> 2442.3590000000004

2439.14 --> 2444.66
bloop bloop and getting kitten machine

2442.359 --> 2444.66
gun

2458.619 --> 2465.2400000000002
turned into the cat guy

2462.04 --> 2465.24
in less than a week

2466.59 --> 2469.639
[Music]

2484.78 --> 2490.1800000000003
right but Lomax you say you're you think

2488.38 --> 2491.92
it's a globe

2490.18 --> 2495.3999999999996
but do you know the housekeeping

2491.92 --> 2497.02
questions of fed I take it you know Flat

2495.4 --> 2499.26
Earth debates Channel at Nathan Oak

2497.02 --> 2499.2599999999998
please

2499.48 --> 2505.619
because he asks the housekeeping

2501.88 --> 2505.619
questions mostly every day

2508.66 --> 2511.14
know them

2514.44 --> 2517.98
144 lives

2519.4 --> 2523.48
you do

2522.04 --> 2527.02
okay

2523.48 --> 2528.76
so why then do you have answers to the

2527.02 --> 2530.32
housekeeping questions

2528.76 --> 2534.42
that would

2530.32 --> 2534.42
allow you to maintain

2534.64 --> 2539.339
proof

2536.32 --> 2539.339
that it is a ball

2563.8 --> 2568.92
some of them like which one

2565.96 --> 2568.92
which ones

2573.88 --> 2579.7000000000003
so how about the evidence for the

2576.4 --> 2582.3
geometric Horizon also known as Earth

2579.7 --> 2582.2999999999997
curve

2582.64 --> 2587.22
the spherical geometry at the horizon

2623.26 --> 2628.7200000000003
what the [ __ ]

2625.9 --> 2632.14
[Music]

2628.72 --> 2634.72
what the hell are you talking about

2632.14 --> 2636.9
is this another is this this bot thing

2634.72 --> 2636.8999999999996
again

2639.16 --> 2643.5989999999997
so [ __ ] sick of just [ __ ]

2641.859 --> 2647.02
comments

2643.599 --> 2649.2000000000003
[ __ ] comments that make no sense at

2647.02 --> 2649.2
all

2654.04 --> 2657.18
yeah get out

2658.54 --> 2663.04
foreign

2660.16 --> 2664.42
the droids we don't want their kind in

2663.04 --> 2668.16
here

2664.42 --> 2668.16
you're gonna have to leave them outside

2691.18 --> 2697.839
okay why do you believe that there are

2695.319 --> 2700.44
smarter people that can answer that that

2697.839 --> 2700.44
makes sense

2702.04 --> 2707.56
Lomax if you don't understand it

2704.92 --> 2711.42
then why do you believe it's a ball just

2707.56 --> 2711.42
because other people can just

2712.02 --> 2718.0
and then actually if you would have the

2715.18 --> 2719.2
faculties as we do over at fed and I

2718.0 --> 2721.96
myself do

2719.2 --> 2724.66
then we can perceive and determine and

2721.96 --> 2726.88
derive how their blah blah blah blah

2724.66 --> 2731.74
blah absolutely makes no [ __ ] sense

2726.88 --> 2734.099
and has literal paradoxical traits as in

2731.74 --> 2737.2599999999998
self-contradicting

2734.099 --> 2739.599
bits within what they say

2737.26 --> 2743.5600000000004
you might have troubles picking up on

2739.599 --> 2745.119
that but we over at fed definitely do

2743.56 --> 2746.859
not have trouble picking up on that and

2745.119 --> 2748.359
that's what we do all the time we point

2746.859 --> 2752.22
out

2748.359 --> 2752.22
why would you rely on those people

2754.72 --> 2759.66
why would you rely on those people

2756.94 --> 2763.9
saying it's a ball despite

2759.66 --> 2767.68
on record contradicting themselves to

2763.9 --> 2770.56
the point where they are so egregiously

2767.68 --> 2772.96
in denial of their own on-record

2770.56 --> 2775.54
contradictions that they get themselves

2772.96 --> 2777.7
banned from the channel because they

2775.54 --> 2780.119
just shamelessly double down on their

2777.7 --> 2780.1189999999997
lying

2780.579 --> 2785.52
why would you rely on people that do

2783.28 --> 2785.52
that

2785.98 --> 2791.859
lubox

2788.38 --> 2793.96
they're obviously sniveling lying

2791.859 --> 2795.7
deviants

2793.96 --> 2798.78
why would you

2795.7 --> 2798.7799999999997
pick that side

2800.8 --> 2806.619
they're all like that by the way

2803.5 --> 2809.319
right if you have any common decency and

2806.619 --> 2811.6600000000003
you need to be on the ball site for some

2809.319 --> 2814.74
reason well the best course of action is

2811.66 --> 2818.319
to shut the [ __ ] up

2814.74 --> 2820.839
keep your [ __ ] mouth shut before you

2818.319 --> 2822.7599999999998
show how insane you are

2820.839 --> 2824.98
right that's the best course of action

2822.76 --> 2826.96
but a lot of people can't do that they

2824.98 --> 2829.98
just have to blah blah blah blah blah

2826.96 --> 2832.599
and then they get on record cut

2829.98 --> 2834.9
contradicting themselves and lying about

2832.599 --> 2834.9
it

2844.9 --> 2849.64
might be right yeah I'm pretty damn sure

2847.359 --> 2853.96
I'm right that's why I'm doing what I do

2849.64 --> 2856.319
that's why this is my profession

2853.96 --> 2859.06
and why I've stuck to Fed for so long

2856.319 --> 2861.94
with everything that's happened

2859.06 --> 2864.46
so many people have actively tried to

2861.94 --> 2866.92
like create a rift between me

2864.46 --> 2869.079
and fed

2866.92 --> 2872.04
and

2869.079 --> 2872.04
it didn't work

2872.619 --> 2879.2200000000003
and I'll still stand up and or complain

2876.099 --> 2882.2200000000003
about Behavior towards me within fed

2879.22 --> 2883.2999999999997
including Nathan's because I'll never

2882.22 --> 2887.6189999999997
like

2883.3 --> 2891.78
become like a subservient to anybody

2887.619 --> 2894.76
but I am also not gonna be scared away

2891.78 --> 2897.579
because of some kind of social pressure

2894.76 --> 2900.099
of any sort

2897.579 --> 2903.2200000000003
it's like oh oh you guys all hate me now

2900.099 --> 2905.819
well that's too [ __ ] bad because I

2903.22 --> 2910.18
was the first fed panelist that's left

2905.819 --> 2912.94
and I'm staying just like oh you don't

2910.18 --> 2916.5989999999997
like me or my homophobia or whatever

2912.94 --> 2920.5
which I really do have well guess what

2916.599 --> 2922.7200000000003
I'm the first person that's lived in

2920.5 --> 2924.52
this building that like took the room

2922.72 --> 2928.1189999999997
I'm the first one

2924.52 --> 2930.339
of when this room became available this

2928.119 --> 2933.579
entire apartment I'm the first person to

2930.339 --> 2936.46
start living here so if you're a gay guy

2933.579 --> 2939.3390000000004
and you get in here too [ __ ] bad for

2936.46 --> 2943.0
you I'll let you live there but if you

2939.339 --> 2945.52
don't like my homophobia you can go [ __ ]

2943.0 --> 2948.599
yourself because I'm the first person

2945.52 --> 2948.599
that lived here

2950.319 --> 2953.2599999999998
yeah

2951.579 --> 2956.8590000000004
do the same thing

2953.26 --> 2961.7400000000002
it works I'm sticking

2956.859 --> 2961.74
I'm staying I'm not going anywhere

2964.24 --> 2966.839
so what

2974.52 --> 2979.92
all righty then yeah let me get my

2976.9 --> 2979.92
Illuminati as well

2985.72 --> 2988.72
hey

3034.14 --> 3038.18
what what's going on here

3051.54 --> 3055.74
OHS what the [ __ ] are you blabbering

3054.48 --> 3059.18
about

3055.74 --> 3059.18
are you drunk or something

3060.3 --> 3064.7000000000003
I can barely follow what the hell you're

3062.22 --> 3064.7
talking about

3092.54 --> 3096.99
what the [ __ ] is going on here you're

3095.46 --> 3101.46

3096.99 --> 3102.9799999999996
[Music]

3101.46 --> 3105.42
yeah

3102.98 --> 3108.38
I'm going to take a bite out of this but

3105.42 --> 3108.38
it's way too hot

3111.11 --> 3114.239

3139.74 --> 3145.7
I'm happy to report I have no idea what

the hell you're talking about

3152.16 --> 3155.239
[Music]

3157.28 --> 3163.44
after watching your rise of these since

3159.839 --> 3166.44
2010 let's say the content is at the

3163.44 --> 3169.28
lowest gutter what content which content

3166.44 --> 3169.28
exactly each other

3179.599 --> 3183.26
can you be specific

3190.44 --> 3195.859
foreign

3192.66 --> 3199.02
because as far as I'm concerned

3195.859 --> 3201.48
it's kind of the same the problem is is

3199.02 --> 3204.66
that it's kind of the same and that

3201.48 --> 3207.42
the argumentations for a lot of letters

3204.66 --> 3210.319
just don't evolve that's really the

3207.42 --> 3210.319
problem that I see

3213.319 --> 3217.7599999999998
that they stick to old horse yet

3218.819 --> 3224.66
Inc like including Eric debate a lot of

3221.579 --> 3224.6600000000003
a lot of them do that

3224.94 --> 3230.059
glow Busters being like one of the worst

3227.46 --> 3230.059
about it

3232.5 --> 3236.94
Eric

3234.18 --> 3240.0589999999997
it if it wasn't very good Mark there

3236.94 --> 3242.48
would be no new trends first what does

3240.059 --> 3242.48
that mean

3242.88 --> 3246.079
what the hell does that mean

3252.54 --> 3259.339
you mean no new people that become flat

3255.66 --> 3259.339
earthers are you kidding me

3266.579 --> 3274.819
that's literally provably not true jedo

3271.559 --> 3274.8190000000004
I'm gonna ban him

3275.579 --> 3281.819
don't tell me what to do lamax

3279.599 --> 3286.28
especially when you don't have a wrench

3281.819 --> 3286.2799999999997
people don't get banned that easily

3292.44 --> 3297.079
I'm just surprised I was saying that

3297.9 --> 3304.38
it's the last time I watched glowbusters

3301.02 --> 3307.68
years ago but I've taken

3304.38 --> 3311.46
audio clips at time

3307.68 --> 3313.44
and then just realize like how

3311.46 --> 3315.2400000000002
absolutely nothing has changed about

3313.44 --> 3318.18
globusters

3315.24 --> 3320.52
they can't argue they can't debate they

3318.18 --> 3323.1189999999997
just roll out whatever the [ __ ] they

3320.52 --> 3325.98
want to roll out in their personal way

3323.119 --> 3328.7400000000002
completely unadapted not made to be

3325.98 --> 3330.72
comprehensible they roll it out and then

3328.74 --> 3332.2799999999997
somebody might disagree about it but

3330.72 --> 3334.22
they can't speak up about it because

3332.28 --> 3338.52
they all have to agree to disagree

3334.22 --> 3342.54
because their entire setup is totally

3338.52 --> 3346.02
[ __ ] it always was [ __ ]

3342.54 --> 3348.839
and it will remain so as long as they

3346.02 --> 3353.339
keep doing that

3348.839 --> 3357.5589999999997
and not confronting errors

3353.339 --> 3357.5589999999997
which is the main problem they have

3358.8 --> 3363.8390000000004
it's becoming a holding on to errors

3361.02 --> 3365.099
game over at globusters and that's the

3363.839 --> 3367.98
problem

3365.099 --> 3370.4
that's why they're all like fumbling so

3367.98 --> 3370.4
terribly

3371.339 --> 3376.7999999999997
because they can't just say like hey

3373.44 --> 3378.359
dude maybe it's just wrong maybe we

3376.8 --> 3381.96
should just move on

3378.359 --> 3384.9
like no no no how they can't do that if

3381.96 --> 3388.46
you do that you're out of the group yeah

3384.9 --> 3388.46
that's the difference with fed

3389.099 --> 3394.26
people will literally contradict you all

3392.16 --> 3396.0789999999997
the time you're not gonna get kicked out

3394.26 --> 3399.42
for it

3396.079 --> 3402.8390000000004
because we're not wussies

3399.42 --> 3405.48
with feeble opinions that with a little

3402.839 --> 3407.819
prodding just burst like a

3405.48 --> 3412.7
like a bubble

3407.819 --> 3416.7
yeah that we have cohesive well refined

3412.7 --> 3416.7
tested conceptions

3418.619 --> 3426.38
can stand inquiry and test

3422.52 --> 3426.38
they don't do that at globusters

3429.32 --> 3438.2400000000002
[Music]

3434.839 --> 3440.96
personally converted 20 people awesome

3438.24 --> 3443.9399999999996
well done LSG

3440.96 --> 3446.28
[Music]

3443.94 --> 3449.16
all right like just look at chocolate

3446.28 --> 3452.8390000000004
Saiyan Man Chocolate saying as like

3449.16 --> 3452.839
probably converted

3454.14 --> 3458.64
like

3455.64 --> 3462.0589999999997
50 people or something in a few years

3458.64 --> 3465.72
just by working and then talking on his

3462.059 --> 3467.52
Flo phone with fed doing the quotes of

3465.72 --> 3469.02
astrophysicists

3467.52 --> 3472.619
and then

3469.02 --> 3474.66
kind of becoming popular because of that

3472.619 --> 3476.339
knowing exactly what to say with the

3474.66 --> 3477.96
baller on the work floor that doesn't

3476.339 --> 3480.599
agree

3477.96 --> 3483.3
to totally snuffed at

3480.599 --> 3486.3
so yeah that wakes up a lot

3483.3 --> 3489.0
a lot of us wake up a lot of people

3486.3 --> 3492.6600000000003
like every FD panelist has woken up

3489.0 --> 3494.94
other people and testified about it

3492.66 --> 3497.7
right and it's like oh yeah we just went

3494.94 --> 3499.619
to this party and yeah I just

3497.7 --> 3501.1189999999997
broke flatter through a whole bunch of

3499.619 --> 3503.52
people

3501.119 --> 3505.559
got it through really well just like I

3503.52 --> 3506.7599999999998
did yesterday yeah and talking about it

3505.559 --> 3509.7200000000003
today

3506.76 --> 3509.7200000000003
we all do that

3511.5 --> 3518.54
yeah

3513.96 --> 3518.54
freaking sticker [ __ ]

3529.74 --> 3533.7
so yeah though I haven't watched

3531.54 --> 3536.04
globusters in ages

3533.7 --> 3538.98
every time I do it's always the same

3536.04 --> 3543.18
type of thing

3538.98 --> 3546.02
same feels the same way of talking and

3543.18 --> 3546.02
maneuvering

3546.359 --> 3550.799
is there anything you'd like to add to

3549.059 --> 3552.9
that

3550.799 --> 3557.359
or you think I'm wrong

3552.9 --> 3557.359
is fed on today no

3558.42 --> 3565.44
that's why I started so late also Emma

3562.799 --> 3568.099
because apparently it's the holiday in

3565.44 --> 3568.099
in England

3573.42 --> 3578.46
you can't convert anybody Yeah well yeah

3576.18 --> 3581.64
though maybe

3578.46 --> 3586.319
grilling of anti-flat Earth or ball

3581.64 --> 3587.339
tards is not the thing to share with a

3586.319 --> 3590.4
person

3587.339 --> 3593.7
that's on the fence or or just isn't

3590.4 --> 3598.14
informed yet maybe it's not for them

3593.7 --> 3599.46
yeah maybe the grilling of anti-flat

3598.14 --> 3602.64
earthers

3599.46 --> 3605.579
isn't for the newcomers it's for those

3602.64 --> 3609.6189999999997
that have already gotten on board who

3605.579 --> 3612.9
want some Weaponry some conversational

3609.619 --> 3614.94
spiritual Weaponry against these

3612.9 --> 3617.94
religious fanatics

3614.94 --> 3620.46
that just become all demonic and double

3617.94 --> 3623.339
speaking Yeah that's what that's for

3620.46 --> 3625.7
it's not for the newcomer ever thought

3623.339 --> 3625.7
of that

3628.2 --> 3634.14
I mean fed is not for like oh never

3632.04 --> 3635.88
heard of Flat Earth before

3634.14 --> 3639.1189999999997
right well

3635.88 --> 3640.98
it could be because the first part is

3639.119 --> 3642.839
just housekeeping questions nobody's

3640.98 --> 3646.02
going to be tea bagged

3642.839 --> 3647.819
unless they just happen to roll in in

3646.02 --> 3650.099
the middle of it and just insist like oh

3647.819 --> 3653.52
now it's my turn oh you're all flat

3650.099 --> 3658.88
Tarts right that can happen well that's

3653.52 --> 3658.88
their move then they moved in to do that

3661.02 --> 3667.98
and then the show becomes about

3665.16 --> 3669.96
how to deal with ball Tarts that double

3667.98 --> 3673.619
speak

3669.96 --> 3676.68
how to get them under control

3673.619 --> 3678.299
how to predict what's gonna happen when

3676.68 --> 3681.24
they do that

3678.299 --> 3682.619
it's not for the the person that

3681.24 --> 3684.24
literally doesn't know anything about

3682.619 --> 3685.6800000000003
Flat Earth

3684.24 --> 3687.359
it's not for them it's not for the

3685.68 --> 3689.7599999999998
beginners it's for those that are

3687.359 --> 3691.02
already on board that are already like

3689.76 --> 3692.8190000000004
yeah

3691.02 --> 3695.52
I get it now

3692.819 --> 3698.64
people are crazy out there ball is a

3695.52 --> 3701.52
crazy religion for them it's very

3698.64 --> 3704.0989999999997
interesting to behold that and very

3701.52 --> 3706.5
relieving also because

3704.099 --> 3708.3590000000004
it is a fight it's a spiritual fight

3706.5 --> 3709.68
that's taking place when Nathan does

3708.359 --> 3712.74
that

3709.68 --> 3715.3799999999997
against the darkness that's

3712.74 --> 3716.52
taking hold of people through that

3715.38 --> 3719.04
religion

3716.52 --> 3721.68
through their denial

3719.04 --> 3723.66
and that fight is very strenuous it's

3721.68 --> 3726.96
very painful if you don't have the right

3723.66 --> 3730.859
tools so to watch Nathan have full

3726.96 --> 3732.359
Mastery over the situation

3730.859 --> 3735.18
is

3732.359 --> 3738.24
very arousing in a way

3735.18 --> 3741.72
in a non-sexual way by the way just it's

3738.24 --> 3744.4199999999996
like yes like um

3741.72 --> 3746.8799999999997
like we're winning the battle finally

3744.42 --> 3749.76
right you're so you I'm so used to

3746.88 --> 3751.1400000000003
before fed every time that sort of thing

3749.76 --> 3753.3590000000004
happened it's just like no the ball

3751.14 --> 3755.819
Tarts just go ballistic and aggressive

3753.359 --> 3758.7599999999998
and you can't win

3755.819 --> 3760.799
and now we can win

3758.76 --> 3764.2990000000004
thanks to the developing

3760.799 --> 3764.299
of these insights

3766.14 --> 3774.839
so that's is not for the newbies fbd is

3771.42 --> 3777.54
not a newbie show it's a specialist Joe

3774.839 --> 3781.68
not a newbie show it's a specialist Joe

3777.54 --> 3783.599
not a Nui show it's a specialist Joe

3781.68 --> 3786.02
yeah

3783.599 --> 3789.2400000000002
if I try to

3786.02 --> 3792.48
introduce Flat Earth to somebody

3789.24 --> 3795.4199999999996
I'm not gonna show them an episode of

3792.48 --> 3799.44
fed where a ball Tarts get interrogated

3795.42 --> 3803.7000000000003
the first time yeah because it's a

3799.44 --> 3806.7000000000003
specialist show not a newbie show

3803.7 --> 3808.74
yeah I'll have a long talk with them

3806.7 --> 3811.98
I'll probably

3808.74 --> 3814.5589999999997
send them a specific Eric Dube video

3811.98 --> 3816.48
that's not riddled with with wrong

3814.559 --> 3819.5400000000004
things in there

3816.48 --> 3821.64
or another maybe a mark Sergeant video

3819.54 --> 3825.66
probably not though at this point it's

3821.64 --> 3828.359
not really necessary anymore

3825.66 --> 3830.8799999999997
and then

3828.359 --> 3832.98
as they start to understand the

3830.88 --> 3835.2000000000003
mechanics and can feed that back to me

3832.98 --> 3838.619
verbally

3835.2 --> 3841.98
then I'll start to make them aware of

3838.619 --> 3845.1600000000003
the psychological struggle with people

3841.98 --> 3847.5
that refuse to see a reason with that

3845.16 --> 3849.299
the the ball Tarts the real Fanatics and

3847.5 --> 3851.339
then they become aware of that then they

3849.299 --> 3854.099
have to learn how to deal with that are

3851.339 --> 3857.04
they gonna avoid that at all costs or

3854.099 --> 3859.44
are they ready to actually face that and

3857.04 --> 3861.7799999999997
try to counter that

3859.44 --> 3864.7200000000003
yeah there's all these stages you have

3861.78 --> 3868.799
to go through to start to be able to

3864.72 --> 3873.1189999999997
appreciate what happens on fed it's not

3868.799 --> 3876.48
a newbie show it's a specialist Joe

3873.119 --> 3879.6800000000003
it's for those that are really in it

3876.48 --> 3879.68
but already know

3880.619 --> 3884.88
and it's there to show you how things

3883.68 --> 3889.5789999999997
happen

3884.88 --> 3889.579
and what you can do about it

3892.26 --> 3897.2400000000002
it's not a mess if you just don't like

3894.96 --> 3898.44
it Shadow then that's just your problem

3897.24 --> 3901.04
then

3898.44 --> 3904.68
and yeah you can criticize Nathan

3901.04 --> 3907.319
sometimes his wording is

3904.68 --> 3908.5789999999997
over the top out of place shocking and

3907.319 --> 3911.16
like

3908.579 --> 3914.46
Unbecoming

3911.16 --> 3917.3999999999996
who gives a [ __ ]

3914.46 --> 3920.7
if it is yeah

3917.4 --> 3922.92
it's not appropriate well go to your

3920.7 --> 3925.9199999999996
snob Club then

3922.92 --> 3930.2000000000003
where everybody's all appropriate yeah

3925.92 --> 3933.44
because we're dealing with maniacally

3930.2 --> 3936.0
insane Liars

3933.44 --> 3938.94
delusional crazy people

3936.0 --> 3941.94
you're gonna have to get really sharp

3938.94 --> 3944.46
tongued and harsh and shocking sometimes

3941.94 --> 3945.96
just to be able to get through to

3944.46 --> 3948.7200000000003
anything

3945.96 --> 3951.839
otherwise you're just

3948.72 --> 3955.859
fighting a concrete wall

3951.839 --> 3958.5589999999997
you gotta get a good drill bit to get

3955.859 --> 3962.04
through the concrete wall if you don't

3958.559 --> 3965.28
[ __ ] like it well too bad

3962.04 --> 3969.359
then you don't watch it

3965.28 --> 3971.76
it's not for newbies it's not for the

3969.359 --> 3975.74
feyna heart

3971.76 --> 3978.5400000000004
it's War baby it's straight on

3975.74 --> 3980.7
psychological War

3978.54 --> 3985.2
that's what it is and guess what

3980.7 --> 3991.2799999999997
psychological war is not neat and tidy

3985.2 --> 3991.2799999999997
it's disgusting disturbing and unnerving

3991.92 --> 3995.539
deal with it or don't

4009.319 --> 4012.319
foreign

4016.28 --> 4020.099
[Music]

4024.079 --> 4028.52
there's entire shows where I basically

4026.18 --> 4031.22
go do something else because I'm just

4028.52 --> 4033.2
getting so freaking bored

4031.22 --> 4035.8999999999996
by the math talk

4033.2 --> 4038.7799999999997
I do I get bored by it I mean I know

4035.9 --> 4041.2400000000002
Brian's really good at it it's just

4038.78 --> 4043.28
really boring to me sometimes it really

4041.24 --> 4045.3799999999997
is it's just like yeah yo we've got the

4043.28 --> 4048.1400000000003
precise of this it's it's even more

4045.38 --> 4050.059
perfect we got the per the proof even

4048.14 --> 4052.4
more perfect mathematically and I'm like

4050.059 --> 4054.38
yeah we get it already

4052.4 --> 4056.119
it's like

4054.38 --> 4059.1800000000003
find

4056.119 --> 4061.52
it's just kind of boring to me we get it

4059.18 --> 4063.44
or like I don't get it you're not gonna

4061.52 --> 4066.02
be able to make me actually understand

4063.44 --> 4067.76
the math detail there because I just

4066.02 --> 4070.7
can't focus on it

4067.76 --> 4073.039
is too mathy it's like it doesn't seem

4070.7 --> 4074.5389999999998
that important to me I'm sure that if

4073.039 --> 4078.1400000000003
you're really good at math it's super

4074.539 --> 4079.28
useful I'm not really that interested

4078.14 --> 4081.92
foreign

4079.28 --> 4084.7400000000002
so I'm not always there like yeah yeah

4081.92 --> 4085.94
no sometimes I'm like I'm just gonna do

4084.74 --> 4087.9199999999996
something else

4085.94 --> 4089.66
and I'll still be on there but I'll just

4087.92 --> 4090.92
have the page on mute I'm just gonna do

4089.66 --> 4094.3999999999996
something else

4090.92 --> 4098.299
I'm not always actually present on the

4094.4 --> 4100.4
live shows my my icon is

4098.299 --> 4101.7789999999995
but I'm not always actually listening

4100.4 --> 4104.679
and participating

4101.779 --> 4107.96
because sometimes it's just like

4104.679 --> 4109.64
and then I try to insert something that

4107.96 --> 4112.339
wouldn't be math related like more

4109.64 --> 4114.319
psychology related or I give like an

4112.339 --> 4115.96
alternative conception and then

4114.319 --> 4119.0
everybody

4115.96 --> 4122.06
you have to change the subject oh you're

4119.0 --> 4123.98
just like oh okay well then just do your

4122.06 --> 4125.42
[ __ ] thing because it's boring the

4123.98 --> 4128.0599999999995
hell out of me

4125.42 --> 4129.79
I'll just go do something else then

4128.06 --> 4131.06
yeah so that does happen

4129.79 --> 4134.839
[Music]

4131.06 --> 4136.9400000000005
I mean it's not my freaking favorite

4134.839 --> 4140.739
show in the world or anything it's not

4136.94 --> 4140.739
like oh my God fed oh

4141.08 --> 4146.9
I want to watch that day and night no

4144.92 --> 4150.56
but I'll definitely notice when there

4146.9 --> 4153.5
isn't any when fed isn't actually live

4150.56 --> 4155.2390000000005
I'll start to feel it there is a thing

4153.5 --> 4158.12
that happens there there is an energy

4155.239 --> 4159.98
Gathering and redistribution

4158.12 --> 4162.8589999999995
there's a lot of energy economy

4159.98 --> 4165.379999999999
happening in fed whether it I like

4162.859 --> 4167.92
what's happening or not

4165.38 --> 4167.92
so

4168.62 --> 4171.759
it's not like

4171.859 --> 4176.14
like I'm too alienated from it

4176.66 --> 4182.179
it's just a lot of development is in a

4179.239 --> 4184.218999999999
direction that just to me personally is

4182.179 --> 4185.96
kind of pointless

4184.219 --> 4189.199
it's like all this detail work and I'm

4185.96 --> 4192.259
like yeah I don't need that like I can

4189.199 --> 4194.98
barely focus on that I'm just gonna

4192.259 --> 4198.739
focus on the more

4194.98 --> 4201.5599999999995
explicable parts the parts that can be

4198.739 --> 4204.639999999999
very made to be understood even by

4201.56 --> 4208.280000000001
people that aren't very intellectual

4204.64 --> 4210.5
that's my specialty and then complicated

4208.28 --> 4212.36
mathematical details yeah guess what

4210.5 --> 4216.38
they don't get involved

4212.36 --> 4218.48
because that will only be understood by

4216.38 --> 4221.32
the real math people

4218.48 --> 4221.32
not everybody

4221.42 --> 4226.34
and unfortunately a lot of the math

4223.34 --> 4228.1990000000005
people are fanatical globers

4226.34 --> 4233.179
and I don't want to even deal with them

4228.199 --> 4236.739
so for me avoiding math is just kind of

4233.179 --> 4236.7390000000005
a social tactic

4239.0 --> 4246.32
because there's a lot of annoying Jesuit

4241.76 --> 4248.54
like mathematicians out there

4246.32 --> 4251.0
that you just can't reason with

4248.54 --> 4253.5199999999995
like we're dealing with those types of

4251.0 --> 4255.86
people on fed they are the anti-flat

4253.52 --> 4258.860000000001
earthers most of them are like

4255.86 --> 4260.78
mathematicians

4258.86 --> 4262.46
and they're really good at math and

4260.78 --> 4265.04
they're super convinced it's a glow

4262.46 --> 4268.88
because all the The Works they learned

4265.04 --> 4271.219
with math all had indoctrination about

4268.88 --> 4274.58
how the Earth is a globe within them

4271.219 --> 4277.46
so their entire understanding of math is

4274.58 --> 4278.9
laced from the get-go with that the

4277.46 --> 4280.76
Earth is a globe

4278.9 --> 4283.94
so their entire framework of

4280.76 --> 4285.860000000001
understanding like like demands of them

4283.94 --> 4287.419999999999
that it is a globe that's how they

4285.86 --> 4289.58
experience it it's very [ __ ]

4287.42 --> 4291.88
aggravating if you know it is in the

4289.58 --> 4291.88
globe

4293.719 --> 4300.38
I'm not a big fan of math

4296.84 --> 4301.219
but I do respect people that have skills

4300.38 --> 4303.92
with it

4301.219 --> 4306.52
as long as they're not [ __ ]

4303.92 --> 4306.52
like

4306.739 --> 4311.0599999999995
with their understandings

4309.02 --> 4312.320000000001
I mean if you just understand math you

4311.06 --> 4315.280000000001
don't understand anything else you're

4312.32 --> 4315.28
not going to get anywhere

4317.78 --> 4323.719
treats me bad on FTD sometimes good well

4321.5 --> 4326.98
you can all help make up for it by

4323.719 --> 4326.9800000000005
donating to my PayPal

4334.159 --> 4340.04
yeah I know Emma Peel he does that

4337.1 --> 4342.860000000001
there's nothing I can do about it except

4340.04 --> 4345.08
one day just not come back anymore and

4342.86 --> 4347.839999999999
then I won't come back anymore and then

4345.08 --> 4350.0
I really won't come back anymore

4347.84 --> 4352.82
so yeah it's up to Nathan man hey if

4350.0 --> 4354.199
Nathan is uh perfectly fine with me just

4352.82 --> 4356.36
leaving

4354.199 --> 4358.339999999999
then I'll just leave I'll start to do

4356.36 --> 4360.62
completely different things

4358.34 --> 4362.719
I'll keep doing this show and I'll take

4360.62 --> 4365.719
my own date and I'll do it right over

4362.719 --> 4368.84
the top of fed and I'll keep doing that

4365.719 --> 4371.32
every day that's what I will do if it

4368.84 --> 4371.32
breaks off

4372.4 --> 4377.44
foreign that's what's going to happen

4377.78 --> 4381.44
and yeah I have to keep fighting for

4379.699 --> 4383.0599999999995
respect

4381.44 --> 4385.759999999999
well that's fine

4383.06 --> 4388.4800000000005
if you sympathize then follow me and

4385.76 --> 4388.4800000000005
support me

4389.179 --> 4397.64
I need support I need it right now

4393.5 --> 4400.94
right now on my PayPal

4397.64 --> 4404.26
or I'm not gonna have any food for the

4400.94 --> 4404.259999999999
next few weeks

4416.42 --> 4421.0
anyway I'm gonna start chowing down

4440.06 --> 4443.06
foreign

4444.32 --> 4446.5
foreign

4459.199 --> 4464.719
by the way it's kind of ironic that now

4462.679 --> 4466.04
the Illuminati croissants actually

4464.719 --> 4470.62
caused

4466.04 --> 4470.62
three Euro 30 at this point

4472.76 --> 4478.96
I told you it gotten 10 up but it is

4476.179 --> 4478.96
kind of funny

4479.06 --> 4484.1
it's like the one funny thing about it

4481.219 --> 4486.82
because the price is going up really

4484.1 --> 4486.820000000001
[ __ ] sucks

4518.12 --> 4523.12
it was an ice wall guy what

4535.4 --> 4540.94
right yeah and then through Nathan you

4537.5 --> 4540.94
found me that's right

4560.659 --> 4563.92
oh what the hell

4578.62 --> 4585.34
right so yeah I'm still gonna keep going

4581.12 --> 4585.34
fpd is not live today

4586.1 --> 4588.1
um

4593.06 --> 4596.320000000001
and I can keep going

4598.159 --> 4600.94
and I will

4601.1 --> 4606.9800000000005
and it might be the last time for a

4604.64 --> 4609.92
while that I'm gonna live stream since

4606.98 --> 4613.879999999999
if I don't get sufficient PayPal money

4609.92 --> 4616.719
in before tomorrow one o'clock I'm not

4613.88 --> 4616.719
gonna do a show

4617.239 --> 4623.379999999999
I won't do a show the day after either

4619.1 --> 4623.38
and the day after either until I do

4624.14 --> 4629.06
and if that keeps up for multiple days I

4627.32 --> 4632.96
will permanently discontinue the early

4629.06 --> 4637.159000000001
bird show and literally try to get a job

4632.96 --> 4641.3
something where at least I get some kind

4637.159 --> 4644.739
of guaranteed pay for my efforts

4641.3 --> 4644.7390000000005
yeah that's what will happen

4646.64 --> 4651.02
and I won't be back after that as I said

4649.76 --> 4653.719
before

4651.02 --> 4656.4800000000005
and it will because if I have to

4653.719 --> 4658.4
transform my inner workings

4656.48 --> 4662.12
just to do that

4658.4 --> 4664.239
I will not want to come back to try and

4662.12 --> 4668.239
do this again yeah the only reason I can

4664.239 --> 4671.718999999999
is because you've all supported me thus

4668.239 --> 4676.12
far sometimes barely

4671.719 --> 4676.12
if that's stopping then I'm stopping

4678.38 --> 4684.7390000000005
I can't allow myself to continue

4682.94 --> 4687.219
if I'm not going to be able to eat

4684.739 --> 4687.218999999999
properly

4693.26 --> 4700.820000000001
and everybody's got bills but there's

4695.54 --> 4704.6
also a reality yeah so I'm sorry

4700.82 --> 4707.799999999999
if you can't pay for it then it ends

4704.6 --> 4707.8
that's the decision

4711.38 --> 4716.12
yeah the government give me something

4713.659 --> 4718.4
yeah they give me something

4716.12 --> 4720.88
I can barely pay the rent for that by

4718.4 --> 4720.879999999999
that yeah

4734.84 --> 4737.8
foreign

4756.88 --> 4761.4800000000005
[Music]

4758.679 --> 4765.9800000000005
of course the cat keeps begging for food

4761.48 --> 4768.32
food that I can't even get them anymore

4765.98 --> 4770.62
because I literally can't afford my own

4768.32 --> 4770.62
food

4776.9 --> 4782.659
and I'm really pissed off in a way guys

4779.239 --> 4786.799999999999
because I have just pumped out

4782.659 --> 4791.0199999999995
arguably the best quality esoteric shows

4786.8 --> 4791.02
of my entire career thus far

4794.31 --> 4802.280000000001
[Music]

4797.14 --> 4806.06
the most detailed concise oversight over

4802.28 --> 4809.0599999999995
really complicated esoteric things that

4806.06 --> 4810.400000000001
most people don't even have an ability

4809.06 --> 4813.8
to explain

4810.4 --> 4816.219
comprehensibly yeah what have I gotten

4813.8 --> 4816.219
for it

4820.64 --> 4827.08
you know that what I get for doing is

4824.48 --> 4827.08
is

4827.48 --> 4835.879999999999
like less than one-fifth on average less

4832.46 --> 4836.9
than one-fifth of the minimum wage

4835.88 --> 4838.76
yeah

4836.9 --> 4841.9
that's what I get for doing this on

4838.76 --> 4841.900000000001
average now

4848.96 --> 4854.3
only reason I keep doing it is because

4851.719 --> 4857.3
I'm just so damn good at it

4854.3 --> 4857.3
foreign

4867.79 --> 4872.569
[Music]

4887.3 --> 4890.3
foreign

4896.42 --> 4900.62
yeah sure I can do all that yeah yeah

4898.88 --> 4903.26
yeah

4900.62 --> 4905.0
well I can do something else and then

4903.26 --> 4907.4800000000005
there's no more early bird show it's up

4905.0 --> 4907.48
to you guys

4919.04 --> 4923.96
do I consider myself a prophet

4922.46 --> 4927.1
uh

4923.96 --> 4927.1
I'm an oracle

4934.04 --> 4939.4
a prophet is a is a very loaded word

4946.159 --> 4950.839999999999
if you want to think of me as a prophet

4948.5 --> 4953.12
well that's really cute well then yeah

4950.84 --> 4955.1
I'm a religious leader or whatever cool

4953.12 --> 4957.44
give me [ __ ] money

4955.1 --> 4959.179
I wanna eat

4957.44 --> 4962.239
yeah

4959.179 --> 4965.2390000000005
oh I'm the god Horizon I don't care what

4962.239 --> 4967.339999999999
the [ __ ] you think I am I need money for

4965.239 --> 4972.259999999999
food

4967.34 --> 4976.54
you got it eating I don't give a [ __ ]

4972.26 --> 4976.54
what you think of me I wanna hate

4977.75 --> 4983.34
[Music]

4999.86 --> 5003.42
does that clear that up for you

5007.48 --> 5010.65
[Music]

5029.62 --> 5034.12
don't take that personal by the way Emma

5031.6 --> 5037.92
feel I'm just universally frustrated I

5034.12 --> 5037.92
don't want more questions I want support

5041.5 --> 5043.679

5053.24 --> 5056.398999999999

5129.34 --> 5134.02
sure Emma Peel well you're struggling

5131.62 --> 5136.239
badly to pay the energy bills well I can

5134.02 --> 5138.52
save you some of that energy bill by

5136.239 --> 5140.799999999999
basically not being here anymore for you

5138.52 --> 5143.040000000001
to waste energy on watching how about

5140.8 --> 5143.04
that

5150.28 --> 5155.639999999999
maybe you can save some energy by just

5152.14 --> 5155.64
turning off your equipment

5156.28 --> 5161.88
I'm sorry I'm just I'm done with it I'm

5158.86 --> 5161.88
done with excuses

5162.04 --> 5167.139
and then it's not specifically you I'm

5164.8 --> 5169.42
universally it's like I can't do this

5167.139 --> 5172.02
for free guys I've been telling you

5169.42 --> 5173.32
forever I can't do this for free

5172.02 --> 5178.42
[Music]

5173.32 --> 5182.08
I need support for my livelihood for my

5178.42 --> 5184.3
physical survival I need that I don't

5182.08 --> 5185.26
have enough money that I get from the

5184.3 --> 5188.56
government

5185.26 --> 5191.62
to get around and buy food I don't get

5188.56 --> 5194.26
enough and there is no way for me to get

5191.62 --> 5197.0199999999995
more from the [ __ ] government so that

5194.26 --> 5199.26
I could get enough there is no way to do

5197.02 --> 5199.26
that

5199.3 --> 5204.159000000001
other than

5200.98 --> 5206.62
completely bypassing it and just getting

5204.159 --> 5208.9
another job somehow and then hope that

5206.62 --> 5212.4
somehow that'll amounts to more income

5208.9 --> 5212.4
which it probably won't

5215.8 --> 5218.8
foreign

5245.84 --> 5249.779
[Music]

5253.12 --> 5256.42
[Music]

5267.219 --> 5269.82
foreign

5315.28 --> 5321.34
never seen a plant grow this fast it

5318.159 --> 5322.96
literally like grew like five percent in

5321.34 --> 5325.0
overnight

5322.96 --> 5329.08
look at all these

5325.0 --> 5330.76
side shoots all all gonna turn into a

5329.08 --> 5332.739
new plan and it's full up there like the

5330.76 --> 5334.9800000000005
entire bottom is getting covered by that

5332.739 --> 5334.98
stuff

5335.02 --> 5338.1
pretty amazing

5350.56 --> 5356.5
and it seems like that entire branch

5354.28 --> 5358.179
oh wait there's more flowers now in the

5356.5 --> 5360.52
other branches too

5358.179 --> 5362.92
so it seems like this little Rosemary

5360.52 --> 5366.159000000001
tree is really

5362.92 --> 5368.1990000000005
going to bloom

5366.159 --> 5370.599999999999
which is adorable I didn't expect that

5368.199 --> 5373.599999999999
it would happen

5370.6 --> 5376.42
there's even Little Flower bits now in

5373.6 --> 5379.5
the other branches

5376.42 --> 5379.5
so that's pretty cool

5400.139 --> 5405.08
does anybody know by the way where

5402.46 --> 5406.5
flatter Sage is like

5405.08 --> 5409.54
[Music]

5406.5 --> 5412.32

[Music]

5442.54 --> 5447.94
oh yeah I almost forgot

5447.94 --> 5450.36
video

5450.4 --> 5455.199
and it I already kind of had a suspicion

5453.159 --> 5457.54
but he like really put the research

5455.199 --> 5461.699
together it's incredible

5457.54 --> 5465.699
about antiqua tech w-e or

5461.699 --> 5465.699
w-e-ws d-e-ws

5470.56 --> 5476.320000000001
and about how Archimedes might have

5473.86 --> 5478.98
actually used like certain types of

5476.32 --> 5478.98
lenses

5479.62 --> 5484.719
I mean seriously this was like one of

5482.26 --> 5486.6990000000005
the most fed after everything one of the

5484.719 --> 5490.38
most fascinating shows

5486.699 --> 5490.379999999999

yeah you don't get to say [ __ ]

5579.28 --> 5585.159
just keep shutting the [ __ ] up just like

5583.3 --> 5587.5
they're during the rest of the show

5585.159 --> 5589.299999999999
where you don't speak up

5587.5 --> 5591.82
because you don't have anything to say

5589.3 --> 5594.54
that's worthwhile

5591.82 --> 5594.54
thank you

5597.4 --> 5600.599999999999
[Music]

5605.44 --> 5610.138999999999
didn't get a notification

5607.54 --> 5610.139
right

5610.179 --> 5615.6990000000005
well it does slip through sometimes and

5613.06 --> 5617.7390000000005
like his uploads are really random like

5615.699 --> 5619.0
you never know when it's gonna be could

5617.739 --> 5620.5
be in the middle of the night it could

5619.0 --> 5621.639
be in the early morning could be in the

5620.5 --> 5623.92
middle of the day you never really know

5621.639 --> 5626.32
when he's gonna upload it

5623.92 --> 5628.3
but I did catch it and it's really

5626.32 --> 5630.96
fascinating that one is really really

5628.3 --> 5630.96
fascinating

5632.98 --> 5635.218999999999
foreign

5636.239 --> 5640.379999999999
Stark realizations too

5640.78 --> 5645.82
that probably

5642.82 --> 5649.12
great burning disasters have all been

5645.82 --> 5652.12
created by the ews and that probably the

5649.12 --> 5653.32
Romans themselves used the ew type

5652.12 --> 5656.32
weapons

5653.32 --> 5658.599999999999
although they mostly you're like you

5656.32 --> 5661.84
used Fresno lensing

5658.6 --> 5665.620000000001
at an incredible early time big lenses

5661.84 --> 5669.159000000001
to literally burn down and melt entire

5665.62 --> 5671.5
cities to completely wipe entire

5669.159 --> 5674.08
civilizations

5671.5 --> 5677.5
and that's what they've been doing

5674.08 --> 5681.159
and it and history has created a cover

5677.5 --> 5685.06
story for it because the technology is

5681.159 --> 5689.138999999999
literally so incredibly dangerous

5685.06 --> 5692.280000000001
that it was deemed not to be known not

5689.139 --> 5696.219
to be allowed to be known by anybody

5692.28 --> 5699.159
but technology has caught up and DWS are

5696.219 --> 5700.96
now just being made again in different

5699.159 --> 5702.4
ways

5700.96 --> 5705.94
yeah

5702.4 --> 5708.4
but it's a really awesome episode yeah I

5705.94 --> 5710.199
don't give a [ __ ] you piece of [ __ ] I

5708.4 --> 5713.339999999999
don't give a [ __ ] about you [ __ ]

5710.199 --> 5713.339999999999

I'm gonna stop swearing sorry about that

5726.699 --> 5730.719
just

5727.96 --> 5734.1

until I do

5756.159 --> 5760.259999999999
and it's not enough 20 is not enough

5761.92 --> 5766.7390000000005
it's just enough for me to continue

5763.9 --> 5766.739
doing the show

5796.06 --> 5798.2390000000005
foreign

5811.86 --> 5816.599999999999
just a bunch of triggered retards

5822.96 --> 5830.7390000000005
your oh how dare you ask for money for

5827.139 --> 5833.9800000000005
all that you do how dare you

5830.739 --> 5838.0599999999995
yeah humans don't get paid for their

5833.98 --> 5840.239
work what kind of outrageous idea do you

5838.06 --> 5840.2390000000005
have

5842.5 --> 5846.219
I don't know what kind of life you guys

5844.9 --> 5847.839999999999
got

5846.219 --> 5850.2390000000005
but

5847.84 --> 5851.92
as far as I'm concerned when you do

5850.239 --> 5855.58
things

5851.92 --> 5859.02
that is performing a surface you're

5855.58 --> 5859.0199999999995
supposed to get paid for that

5864.46 --> 5871.679
yes this is live hello DJ one deck

5869.199 --> 5871.678999999999
do you

5875.38 --> 5879.639
and my show is always live I never do

5877.48 --> 5883.78
premieres you might have noticed I've

5879.639 --> 5885.76
literally never run a premiere

5883.78 --> 5887.639
oh wait I might have like done it like

5885.76 --> 5891.219
twice

5887.639 --> 5894.639
like with the Patricia stair live stream

5891.219 --> 5897.179
I think I I up yeah I premiered that

5894.639 --> 5897.179
maybe

5897.34 --> 5901.4800000000005
but yeah

5899.08 --> 5904.12
the amount of times I I did a premiere

5901.48 --> 5906.78
on my channel you can count on one hand

5904.12 --> 5906.78
pretty sure

5907.239 --> 5911.699
I'm just live every day well

5913.659 --> 5917.46
until I'm not anymore

5920.56 --> 5925.3
how are you doing there's no live fed

5922.659 --> 5927.9
today so

5925.3 --> 5927.900000000001
foreign

5929.92 --> 5934.26
so I started a bit late and gonna keep

5932.08 --> 5934.26
going

5948.219 --> 5952.42
what

5949.54 --> 5954.88
okay um that's hilarious but how is me

5952.42 --> 5957.58
doing more shows

5954.88 --> 5960.0
gonna help my situation exactly how is

5957.58 --> 5960.0
that working

5964.659 --> 5969.239
12 hour shifts damn that's a lot

5975.639 --> 5981.1
right but yeah that two hours a day it's

5978.46 --> 5983.9800000000005
not the only thing I do I

5981.1 --> 5986.9400000000005
what I can do in those two hours

5983.98 --> 5991.54
sometimes three by the way

5986.94 --> 5993.5199999999995
is based on everything that I do all day

5991.54 --> 5998.34
long

5993.52 --> 5998.34
for over a decade for over two decades

5998.56 --> 6004.1
so I'm continually everything I do gets

6002.1 --> 6006.900000000001
involved in my show everything I do

6004.1 --> 6009.719
whatever I watch whatever I play

6006.9 --> 6012.86
whatever I eat everything

6009.719 --> 6012.86
it's all focused

6016.92 --> 6021.62
would reach a different audit yeah and

6018.6 --> 6021.620000000001
it wouldn't be this anymore

6031.02 --> 6036.92
most Europeans

6033.179 --> 6036.92
yeah sure sure they are

6042.0 --> 6047.34
still do this too no no I wouldn't if

6044.94 --> 6051.5
I'm gonna do another show I'm definitely

6047.34 --> 6051.5
like I don't have energy for that yeah

6053.34 --> 6059.82
yeah sure I could like for six hours a

6056.58 --> 6061.98
day kind of hang around and game or

6059.82 --> 6063.84
something live right yeah I can do that

6061.98 --> 6065.699
because there's literally no energy

6063.84 --> 6068.82
involved in that at all

6065.699 --> 6072.08
if I'm actually gonna do this yeah I

6068.82 --> 6076.739
can't do that multiple times a day

6072.08 --> 6079.0199999999995
especially when I can barely [ __ ] eat

6076.739 --> 6082.4
okay

6079.02 --> 6082.400000000001
don't have that room

6092.82 --> 6099.179
besides like

6095.46 --> 6102.179
it's not like it's not worth watching

6099.179 --> 6104.82
this show ever unless you're in the live

6102.179 --> 6106.8
chat that's just not true

6104.82 --> 6109.259999999999
there's plenty of people that watch my

6106.8 --> 6111.26
shows afterward

6109.26 --> 6111.26
s

6114.02 --> 6120.1990000000005
yeah you think I'm gonna make money

6116.1 --> 6120.1990000000005
doing that classical homeopath really

6121.56 --> 6128.0
I mean most Dutch people can speak a

6125.58 --> 6128.0
little English

6133.139 --> 6139.26
teaching more donations in the evening

6136.38 --> 6142.26
really you think

6139.26 --> 6142.26
foreign

6153.32 --> 6158.699
guys I can do like a fun run or

6156.36 --> 6162.179
something but like I would have to

6158.699 --> 6164.759999999999
figure out a theme for that perhaps

6162.179 --> 6168.679
but yeah sure I could do but I mean it's

6164.76 --> 6168.679
not really gonna help that much

6171.0 --> 6176.699
what I need is just regular support

6174.179 --> 6178.9800000000005
I can't just start like oh well since

6176.699 --> 6180.96
I'm getting no more support at all or

6178.98 --> 6182.82
barely well then I have to do like

6180.96 --> 6185.04
special nights just to get the support

6182.82 --> 6186.36
oh what and then that's gonna become a

6185.04 --> 6189.42
monthly thing

6186.36 --> 6193.82
or will it then become a weekly thing

6189.42 --> 6193.82
how long before that also Runs Out

6200.82 --> 6206.5199999999995
oh it's small no I'm not taking loans

6203.639 --> 6209.159000000001
I'll take the money though

6206.52 --> 6211.6990000000005
yeah there's no loans I'm not taking

6209.159 --> 6211.699
loans

6224.34 --> 6228.679
but it's more popular in the evenings

6238.26 --> 6241.88
no that's fine Richard G

6244.37 --> 6247.46
[Music]

6249.659 --> 6254.299999999999
I mean it's obviously just a stupid suck

6260.639 --> 6263.4800000000005
I think

6263.94 --> 6268.94
I have a very old YouTube account though

6266.219 --> 6268.94
that's weird

6272.52 --> 6278.159000000001
these kind of fun I'll abandoned but I'm

6275.76 --> 6280.26
not I totally get it Richard G it was

6278.159 --> 6283.04
trollish so

6280.26 --> 6283.04
don't worry

6284.34 --> 6289.219
okay

6285.42 --> 6289.219
I wanted to give him a timeout

6296.82 --> 6301.5
right but anyway if yeah somebody could

6299.4 --> 6303.659
lend me a million dollars that's really

6301.5 --> 6306.179
cute well if you're gonna do that

6303.659 --> 6309.119
then be sure that there's going to be an

6306.179 --> 6310.4
addendum contract that will state that I

6309.119 --> 6314.759999999999
will

6310.4 --> 6316.799999999999
guaranteedly not pay it back and that I

6314.76 --> 6319.619000000001
need a signature from the one that gave

6316.8 --> 6321.659000000001
me the loan that they know and

6319.619 --> 6324.659
understand that I'm not gonna give it

6321.659 --> 6326.339999999999
back yeah you can call it a loan but I'm

6324.659 --> 6329.5199999999995
not paying it back

6326.34 --> 6332.58
and that needs to be officially known

6329.52 --> 6337.38
that there's no mistake about it

6332.58 --> 6342.739
and there's no legal implications

6337.38 --> 6342.7390000000005
because I vouch not to pay it back

6357.98 --> 6362.879999999999
man an Illuminati custom I'm still

6361.08 --> 6365.4
hungry

6362.88 --> 6367.9800000000005
sort of not really

6365.4 --> 6371.119
sort of I don't know

6367.98 --> 6371.119
what the hell I'm feeling

6375.28 --> 6378.46
[Music]

6379.38 --> 6388.159000000001
using the same subjects discussed in fed

6383.88 --> 6388.159000000001
dude that's [ __ ] boring as [ __ ]

6390.36 --> 6394.259999999999
like I don't want to talk about those

6392.58 --> 6396.54
things you might have taken notice that

6394.26 --> 6398.9400000000005
I don't really like to talk about all

6396.54 --> 6401.28
that stuff literally I had an entire

6398.94 --> 6402.96
segment on today's show explaining how I

6401.28 --> 6405.239
don't like to talk about their stuff

6402.96 --> 6408.02
that I sometimes tune out because it

6405.239 --> 6408.0199999999995
just bores me

6408.36 --> 6412.92
oh so now I should do a show and host

6411.659 --> 6415.199
that

6412.92 --> 6417.4800000000005
wow

6415.199 --> 6420.599999999999
I'm not gonna be into that

6417.48 --> 6422.339999999999
right I'll be into like hey you want to

6420.6 --> 6426.6
talk about spirit

6422.34 --> 6429.78
religion and esoteric stuff

6426.6 --> 6433.1
well come on in that's that will be cool

6429.78 --> 6433.099999999999
I'm not fed

6438.78 --> 6445.199
I talk about Spirit mechanics psychology

6443.4 --> 6450.179
and

6445.199 --> 6450.178999999999
like esoteric occultism

6464.82 --> 6470.099999999999
but yeah sure mfpo I mean I mean if this

6467.34 --> 6471.719
just doesn't work and nobody's gonna

6470.1 --> 6474.119000000001
support me

6471.719 --> 6474.9
and these early bird show is going to

6474.119 --> 6477.839999999999
stop

6474.9 --> 6480.179
well then yeah if I don't like get a job

6477.84 --> 6482.28
or something then I might just like

6480.179 --> 6484.9800000000005
abandon the early bird show and that

6482.28 --> 6487.679
will be permanently

6484.98 --> 6491.159
and then I might try an evening show and

6487.679 --> 6494.219
like basically steal flat sides part and

6491.159 --> 6496.92
have an actual audibly comprehensible

6494.219 --> 6498.659
show that isn't always recycling the

6496.92 --> 6501.78
same [ __ ] over and over again and just

6498.659 --> 6505.92
by whining about ball tarts

6501.78 --> 6508.08
because I find it a little boring

6505.92 --> 6510.0
I mean I like hanging around flat sides

6508.08 --> 6513.3
because of the people there

6510.0 --> 6517.639
that's what I like people there the

6513.3 --> 6517.639
actual content is very meh

6518.82 --> 6525.92
that's why it's not in my favorite list

6522.179 --> 6525.92
so yeah I might compete with that

6534.54 --> 6539.179
yeah evening on yeah that's cool Emma

6536.58 --> 6541.98
Peel that's very nice

6539.179 --> 6545.639
I know what to do if I'm ever going to

6541.98 --> 6548.759999999999
do something like that the point is

6545.639 --> 6552.54
that would be the end of the early bird

6548.76 --> 6555.2390000000005
show yeah there's not gonna be a number

6552.54 --> 6558.78
3300

6555.239 --> 6564.659
there's not gonna be an 1800 if we'd go

6558.78 --> 6564.659
there the early bird show ends

6573.179 --> 6575.4800000000005
foreign

6582.18 --> 6585.279
[Music]

6646.199 --> 6648.379999999999
foreign

6669.75 --> 6673.17
[Music]

6673.5 --> 6678.56
well if I stop the early bird show I

6676.08 --> 6678.5599999999995
think that

6679.08 --> 6684.3
there would still be sufficient material

6681.84 --> 6687.84
around for people to basically dig into

6684.3 --> 6689.76
that for decades

6687.84 --> 6694.34
because most people that are watching

6689.76 --> 6694.34
they may be seen half

6698.28 --> 6703.5599999999995
there's no real time left to just dig

6700.98 --> 6707.239
backwards right you just follow the

6703.56 --> 6707.2390000000005
latest stuff what happens

6707.46 --> 6711.9
you're not gonna also watch older shows

6709.86 --> 6714.719
on top of that just to try to catch up

6711.9 --> 6716.94
with the old stuff so if I quit well

6714.719 --> 6720.139
then you could all just dig around in

6716.94 --> 6720.138999999999
1700 episodes

6720.179 --> 6723.08
mm-hmm

6727.88 --> 6734.04
but in reality I don't want to quit

6730.56 --> 6737.400000000001
because this time slot is ideal for me

6734.04 --> 6738.96
it's where I am the most focused where I

6737.4 --> 6742.0199999999995
can perform the best

6738.96 --> 6745.139
it's what I've worked at this has been

6742.02 --> 6749.179
my job this is how I work the best this

6745.139 --> 6749.179
is how my performance works the best

6749.28 --> 6755.099999999999
anything else doing anything else is

6752.699 --> 6758.159
going to detract from the quality of

6755.1 --> 6761.46
what I can do anything else no matter

6758.159 --> 6763.5599999999995
what the suggested maneuver is

6761.46 --> 6765.84
it's going to detract from my quality

6763.56 --> 6771.4400000000005
and that's a fact and there's nothing

6765.84 --> 6775.08
you can argue or Reason to change that

6771.44 --> 6778.28
so it remains support me

6775.08 --> 6778.28
last chance

6782.159 --> 6786.08
got the 1300 tomorrow

6786.9 --> 6791.179
after that no more early bird show

6803.119 --> 6806.179
thank you

6827.4 --> 6830.0
all right

6863.159 --> 6865.638999999999
okay

6866.58 --> 6870.32
all right so yeah

6871.76 --> 6876.4800000000005
Netherlands 2 seems to be getting ready

6874.02 --> 6879.4800000000005
for rollout

6876.48 --> 6881.339999999999
information has scattered through about

6879.48 --> 6884.5199999999995
how there's probably going to be new

6881.34 --> 6888.32
Corona measures halfway this month which

6884.52 --> 6888.320000000001
is in 11 days from now

6888.54 --> 6893.1
who knows how much is Gonna Roll Out I

6891.54 --> 6895.56
doubt it's gonna be to the same level

6893.1 --> 6898.92
they're not gonna like the people now

6895.56 --> 6901.26
all know there's no more discussion

6898.92 --> 6903.3
there's no more oh we don't know yet

6901.26 --> 6906.119000000001
that's not there anymore it's all

6903.3 --> 6908.52
figured out now so those measures would

6906.119 --> 6911.46
not be able to get through this time

6908.52 --> 6913.679
so I wonder how far

6911.46 --> 6917.28
it will be implemented

6913.679 --> 6919.619
or will it be only appear to be

6917.28 --> 6921.719
implemented and there's nobody actually

6919.619 --> 6924.0599999999995
doing it that would be very interesting

6921.719 --> 6926.1
it's like oh officially we got it but

6924.06 --> 6929.159000000001
literally nobody's cooperating so it's

6926.1 --> 6931.5
practically non-present

6929.159 --> 6933.48
would be interesting I'm very curious to

6931.5 --> 6936.26
see how it's gonna roll out in the next

6933.48 --> 6936.259999999999
two weeks

6938.82 --> 6940.94
thank you

6947.07 --> 6950.46
[Music]

6958.92 --> 6965.9400000000005
wow so somebody else gonna say anything

6963.06 --> 6967.92
is this 10 minutes of silence

6965.94 --> 6970.339999999999
a sign for me that I'm gonna round out

6967.92 --> 6970.34
the show

7003.219 --> 7011.7390000000005
whiscept our rights no not really

7007.699 --> 7016.638999999999
it's claimed emergency powers

7011.739 --> 7019.218999999999
it's a deal between organizations

7016.639 --> 7021.26
including government like

7019.219 --> 7023.6
it's not really your rights can't

7021.26 --> 7026.4800000000005
actually be usurped

7023.6 --> 7029.56
it can only be usurped if you agree to

7026.48 --> 7029.5599999999995
it you see

7030.98 --> 7035.718999999999
if you accept that that is real if

7033.56 --> 7038.659000000001
you're saying all right are you sure

7035.719 --> 7040.699
well then you just made it happen

7038.659 --> 7043.299999999999
because you accepted that they were

7040.699 --> 7043.299999999999
usurped

7058.159 --> 7063.86
you see my constitutional rights cannot

7060.92 --> 7066.1990000000005
be usurped and I keep declaring that

7063.86 --> 7068.119
and I might get letters like oh there's

7066.199 --> 7070.339999999999
this and that that you have to do and

7068.119 --> 7073.098999999999
it's like yeah that's all our [ __ ]

7070.34 --> 7075.4400000000005
it's all a bunch of policy [ __ ]

7073.099 --> 7076.76
I'm going to like stick to the

7075.44 --> 7079.82
Constitution

7076.76 --> 7082.400000000001
and that means there's nothing you can

7079.82 --> 7084.679
make me do

7082.4 --> 7086.659
that's that simple

7084.679 --> 7090.02
like you can say all these things about

7086.659 --> 7092.48
it but I repeal to my constitutional

7090.02 --> 7094.9400000000005
rights so you can blah blah blah policy

7092.48 --> 7096.619
oh you have to do that no no no I don't

7094.94 --> 7100.239
have to do that you see

7096.619 --> 7100.239
I have a constitutional right

7100.34 --> 7106.04
and all that made up horseshit is not

7103.219 --> 7109.94
gonna persuade me

7106.04 --> 7111.8
into your things that you want me to do

7109.94 --> 7113.419999999999
because I don't need to do those things

7111.8 --> 7116.06
because it's not part of the

7113.42 --> 7118.54
Constitution it's just a bunch of policy

7116.06 --> 7118.54
nonsense

7123.5 --> 7128.92
that's my composure and that's what I do

7125.96 --> 7128.92
and it works

7130.099 --> 7134.119000000001
with that attitude two government

7132.44 --> 7136.28
workers

7134.119 --> 7139.88
they don't give you attitude they don't

7136.28 --> 7141.98
give you lip they don't put you on lists

7139.88 --> 7144.56
they respect that

7141.98 --> 7147.5599999999995
when I tell them yeah this is a bunch of

7144.56 --> 7150.7390000000005
policy nonsense I'm sticking to my

7147.56 --> 7153.580000000001
constitutional right they're like yeah

7150.739 --> 7153.58
that's very smart

7153.8 --> 7158.78
because a lot of them actually know it's

7156.139 --> 7163.3
[ __ ] it's just procedure

7158.78 --> 7165.5599999999995
and most people buy the procedure

7163.3 --> 7170.1990000000005
because they don't know the difference

7165.56 --> 7170.1990000000005
between policy and law at all

7170.3 --> 7173.56
I think it's all the same

7188.36 --> 7192.739
who would expect more coercion threats

7190.34 --> 7194.2390000000005
yeah but I mean

7192.739 --> 7198.0199999999995
instead

7194.239 --> 7201.86
they do sometimes do that

7198.02 --> 7205.580000000001
they just don't do it to anybody like

7201.86 --> 7209.9
they have their people that kind of are

7205.58 --> 7211.34
like that they get sent to specific

7209.9 --> 7212.98
people

7211.34 --> 7217.28
that have been

7212.98 --> 7220.36
determined to be vulnerable to that

7217.28 --> 7222.739
as in that they would respond and even

7220.36 --> 7225.619
assume of course that's gonna happen

7222.739 --> 7228.259999999999
yeah I'm not assuming of course some

7225.619 --> 7231.5599999999995
[ __ ] gonna continually whine to me

7228.26 --> 7233.360000000001
and threaten to take my money away so

7231.56 --> 7235.52
that I do something that no I'm not

7233.36 --> 7237.799999999999
assuming that

7235.52 --> 7241.52
I know it's out there but those people

7237.8 --> 7244.88
only get put to the task with people

7241.52 --> 7247.780000000001
that actually respond to that

7244.88 --> 7250.76
and think that that that's normal

7247.78 --> 7253.82
that's who those people get sent to to

7250.76 --> 7257.06
harass the people that accept it I don't

7253.82 --> 7259.96
accept it I'll literally threaten such

7257.06 --> 7262.820000000001
person with death

7259.96 --> 7265.4
if they cross a line

7262.82 --> 7266.9
it's like you're not gonna do anything

7265.4 --> 7269.0
with me

7266.9 --> 7271.58
you're not gonna force yourself into my

7269.0 --> 7274.46
house you're not gonna change my

7271.58 --> 7279.04
paychecks you're not gonna do anything

7274.46 --> 7279.04
because you have no right to do anything

7282.739 --> 7289.9
right and they leave me alone now

7286.4 --> 7289.9
because they know I know

7293.179 --> 7294.9800000000005
yeah

7293.8 --> 7297.28
[Music]

7294.98 --> 7297.28
foreign

7301.239 --> 7306.08
sucks yeah but that happened like almost

7303.739 --> 7310.178999999999
everywhere in the world

7306.08 --> 7310.179
and back then three years ago

7314.84 --> 7320.659000000001
right but by now I mean that should not

7317.599 --> 7323.84
be happening again because

7320.659 --> 7325.879999999999
it's admittedly non-functional like it's

7323.84 --> 7327.08
been admitted by the governments that

7325.88 --> 7330.5
forced it

7327.08 --> 7333.139
literally on camera officially reported

7330.5 --> 7337.179
like this doesn't work

7333.139 --> 7341.0
so they have no

7337.179 --> 7342.7390000000005
viable ground even temporary or an

7341.0 --> 7346.219
emergency they have no more viable

7342.739 --> 7348.98
ground to force such measures

7346.219 --> 7351.619
they can only suggest it and then hope

7348.98 --> 7354.44
that people are stupid enough to buy

7351.619 --> 7357.5
because they've already disclaimed

7354.44 --> 7359.54
themselves that it serves a function

7357.5 --> 7361.4
it doesn't serve a function it's proven

7359.54 --> 7365.0
not to serve a function

7361.4 --> 7367.638999999999
so they can't make you do that

7365.0 --> 7371.3
because it doesn't serve the function

7367.639 --> 7373.04
which is why the emergency for it was

7371.3 --> 7374.84
there in the first place it doesn't work

7373.04 --> 7376.639
so they can't make you do it now they

7374.84 --> 7378.4400000000005
admitted it didn't work

7376.639 --> 7380.78
and it doesn't work and it can't work

7378.44 --> 7384.199
it's not gonna work so they can't make

7380.78 --> 7386.36
you do it they can only tell you do this

7384.199 --> 7388.638999999999
and if you're just stupid enough to just

7386.36 --> 7390.5599999999995
do it well that's the best they can get

7388.639 --> 7392.3
out of it because they have no more

7390.56 --> 7394.34
ground works

7392.3 --> 7397.639
to base

7394.34 --> 7400.42
doing that on any logical reason they

7397.639 --> 7400.42
don't have it anymore

7419.119 --> 7423.5
yeah that is horrendous am appeal but

7421.46 --> 7426.92
that surrendous to a level where people

7423.5 --> 7429.5
will die in back alleys from that yeah

7426.92 --> 7432.1990000000005
if some [ __ ] [ __ ] forces you to do

7429.5 --> 7434.599
that and like makes notes and then you

7432.199 --> 7439.159
lose your income those people are gonna

7434.599 --> 7441.38
die horrendously like a rent open with

7439.159 --> 7444.138999999999
their guts spilling out and blood

7441.38 --> 7447.139
everywhere finding them dead with

7444.139 --> 7448.88
horrendous pain looks on their face in

7447.139 --> 7450.86
alleys that's what's gonna happen to

7448.88 --> 7453.38
those people yeah

7450.86 --> 7456.0199999999995
if you're gonna force people to do

7453.38 --> 7458.4800000000005
things and if they don't cooperate you

7456.02 --> 7461.599
take their entire income away you are

7458.48 --> 7464.419999999999
gonna end up dead with horrendous looks

7461.599 --> 7468.38
on your face in alleys with your guts

7464.42 --> 7470.54
rent open with blunt knives and your

7468.38 --> 7472.34
guts all over the floor and blood that's

7470.54 --> 7474.38
what's gonna happen to you if you're

7472.34 --> 7476.84
somebody that does that professionally

7474.38 --> 7478.34
for the government you are gonna end up

7476.84 --> 7482.42
dead

7478.34 --> 7484.719
in an alley with your guts hanging out

7482.42 --> 7484.719
of you

7491.9 --> 7497.839999999999
because what else is there left you just

7495.199 --> 7501.619
took somebody's entire life

7497.84 --> 7506.4800000000005
you did that you are going to die

7501.619 --> 7509.799999999999
you are going to have a torturous end

7506.48 --> 7509.799999999999
I hope it's worth it

7519.619 --> 7523.82
yeah when it comes to corporations

7521.54 --> 7526.639
that's different though yeah that is

7523.82 --> 7528.139
true a corporation yeah it's there right

7526.639 --> 7530.119
it's their ground

7528.139 --> 7531.9800000000005
if they have those rules then there's

7530.119 --> 7534.98
nothing you can do about it but when

7531.98 --> 7539.299999999999
it's the public areas

7534.98 --> 7542.44
right or stores like grocery stores

7539.3 --> 7542.4400000000005
your own home

7542.78 --> 7547.28
School Terrain

7545.42 --> 7549.619
all these things that aren't that

7547.28 --> 7552.38
necessarily corporate

7549.619 --> 7554.299999999999
corporately owned they don't have the

7552.38 --> 7556.52
right to do that

7554.3 --> 7558.56
they don't

7556.52 --> 7561.080000000001
corporations can do whatever the [ __ ]

7558.56 --> 7562.6990000000005
they want they can make you wear a strap

7561.08 --> 7565.639
on dildo

7562.699 --> 7567.379999999999
literally just because they say you have

7565.639 --> 7569.0
to do that and if you refuse then they

7567.38 --> 7569.84
have the right to fire you and kick you

7569.0 --> 7572.3
off

7569.84 --> 7575.3
with of course some issue like you'll

7572.3 --> 7578.06
get benefit yeah legal stuff will still

7575.3 --> 7581.42
apply but literally Corporation can make

7578.06 --> 7583.580000000001
you do whatever the [ __ ] they want

7581.42 --> 7585.92
you have no rights in that sense with

7583.58 --> 7588.94
corporations you have the right to walk

7585.92 --> 7588.9400000000005
away and be fired

7590.42 --> 7595.2390000000005
but governments can't actually do that

7592.88 --> 7595.2390000000005
to you

7597.92 --> 7605.78
because you do have your rights when it

7601.58 --> 7608.119
concerns public areas your own home

7605.78 --> 7611.0599999999995
in relation to the government

7608.119 --> 7614.839999999999
if you enter corporate ground well then

7611.06 --> 7618.320000000001
you relinquish those rights in trade of

7614.84 --> 7621.08
being part of the corporation

7618.32 --> 7624.82
but you can still walk away

7621.08 --> 7624.82
to basically regain all that

7629.179 --> 7635.659
right

7630.98 --> 7637.94
but yeah I mean that's horrendous amapio

7635.659 --> 7640.46
people literally tell you have to do

7637.94 --> 7642.44
this if some public official tells you

7640.46 --> 7644.9
you have to do this

7642.44 --> 7647.0
in your own life or your own home and

7644.9 --> 7649.94
you don't do it and they return take

7647.0 --> 7652.699
your money out of your check

7649.94 --> 7656.9
those people are gonna die

7652.699 --> 7659.0599999999995
is going to be known who decides on that

7656.9 --> 7663.82
and they are going to be found with

7659.06 --> 7663.820000000001
their guts hanging out of them in alleys

7664.92 --> 7667.979
[Music]

7672.86 --> 7677.739
I can't wait to see the news reports on

7675.139 --> 7677.7390000000005
that by the way

7677.84 --> 7682.46
or maybe they just don't report on it

7680.06 --> 7686.5
because it's too risky

7682.46 --> 7686.5
you might give other people suggestions

7712.58 --> 7715.96
right yeah

7724.94 --> 7728.5
higher energy bills yeah

7738.32 --> 7742.58
yeah but that's why they did it right I

7740.42 --> 7744.56
mean the higher energy bills that's why

7742.58 --> 7747.0199999999995
they did it they [ __ ] it up

7744.56 --> 7749.900000000001
like the higher energy bills came after

7747.02 --> 7751.580000000001
the supposed lockdowns right there were

7749.9 --> 7753.799999999999
locked Downs people just worked at home

7751.58 --> 7756.5
it's like oh this works fine

7753.8 --> 7757.6990000000005
then they opt the prices to insane

7756.5 --> 7760.4
levels

7757.699 --> 7761.719
and certainly now it doesn't work

7760.4 --> 7763.82
anymore

7761.719 --> 7767.06
I I cannot

7763.82 --> 7772.04
emphasize enough how much this is a

7767.06 --> 7772.04
planned societal sabotage

7773.78 --> 7780.92
they're on purpose arranging things so

7778.219 --> 7783.679
that it's impossible

7780.92 --> 7787.4800000000005
to financially thrive

7783.679 --> 7787.4800000000005
that's what they've done

7789.139 --> 7794.54
they make it impossible for you to

7792.679 --> 7796.46
financially thrive

7794.54 --> 7799.46
that's what they do

7796.46 --> 7801.199
that's why they're Marxist

7799.46 --> 7803.4800000000005
saboteur

7801.199 --> 7805.5199999999995
traders to their own countries

7803.48 --> 7807.379999999999
and should be executed for that for

7805.52 --> 7809.3
being part of that system

7807.38 --> 7812.1990000000005
for doing that

7809.3 --> 7816.1990000000005
treacherous

7812.199 --> 7816.199
execution Worthy

7819.139 --> 7824.84
but I mean it's International and

7821.96 --> 7826.639
Complicated by now so but it is what it

7824.84 --> 7828.1990000000005
is and

7826.639 --> 7831.08
ah

7828.199 --> 7833.419999999999
the issue is the power scam needs to

7831.08 --> 7835.46
stop it needs to stop heart and the

7833.42 --> 7837.5
people and companies involved should be

7835.46 --> 7840.32
treated brutally

7837.5 --> 7842.599
like if I had any kind of control I'd

7840.32 --> 7845.42
start to like

7842.599 --> 7848.900000000001
just take the military and just like go

7845.42 --> 7851.3
and occupy the power companies to get

7848.9 --> 7853.759999999999
things in order and literally take it

7851.3 --> 7856.52
from them it's like yeah we're

7853.76 --> 7858.7390000000005
nationalizing you now get the [ __ ] out

7856.52 --> 7859.9400000000005
before you shoot you in the face

7858.739 --> 7862.94
yeah

7859.94 --> 7866.48
that's what I would do like oh oh power

7862.94 --> 7869.0
cup go [ __ ] yourself you filthy [ __ ]

7866.48 --> 7871.4
corporations go [ __ ] yourself we're

7869.0 --> 7873.739
nationalizing power again and we're

7871.4 --> 7876.86
gonna reorganize this so that we

7873.739 --> 7879.08
actually get power

7876.86 --> 7880.88
and that we can actually have a

7879.08 --> 7883.94
civilization again

7880.88 --> 7886.639
where nobody just goes bust and grows

7883.94 --> 7888.259999999999
hungry all the time because power prices

7886.639 --> 7890.96
are outrageous

7888.26 --> 7894.34
and are not being fixed which is

7890.96 --> 7894.34
outrageous and Criminal

7900.199 --> 7905.119
yeah I know Richard G

7902.3 --> 7907.9400000000005
I know it's it's done here a while ago

7905.119 --> 7911.719
the privatization and it's Criminal

7907.94 --> 7913.28
it should be immediately reclaimed by

7911.719 --> 7915.56
the military

7913.28 --> 7919.759999999999
just like yeah it's cute you're trying

7915.56 --> 7922.6990000000005
to [ __ ] us so we're now taking your

7919.76 --> 7926.659000000001
supposed property yeah like we're taking

7922.699 --> 7929.119
it no compensation now get the [ __ ] out

7926.659 --> 7932.799999999999
before we shoot you in the head

7929.119 --> 7932.799999999999
you [ __ ] traitors

7950.3 --> 7955.52
so that's my policy

7953.78 --> 7958.099
give me power

7955.52 --> 7960.860000000001
and I will immediately without

7958.099 --> 7963.400000000001
compensation nationalize all power

7960.86 --> 7963.4
production

7964.46 --> 7971.119
and make it work and make electric

7968.0 --> 7974.32
prices doable again

7971.119 --> 7974.32
I will force it

7974.48 --> 7980.119
and I will literally confiscate all the

7978.56 --> 7983.0
prophets

7980.119 --> 7987.4
that these disgusting [ __ ] power

7983.0 --> 7989.719
corporations have reaped from the nation

7987.4 --> 7993.4
abusing them

7989.719 --> 7993.4
with these insane prices

7993.619 --> 7998.598999999999
yeah and all that profit you made you're

7996.38 --> 8002.02
not gonna have that profit

7998.599 --> 8004.3
you're gonna have a giant bill

8002.02 --> 8008.38
for your lawyers that you're gonna need

8004.3 --> 8012.099
to have to not go to jail for being

8008.38 --> 8014.579
complicit within conspiracy to destroy

8012.099 --> 8014.579
the country

8023.739 --> 8025.799999999999
um

8059.02 --> 8062.26
I don't know what you're talking about

8060.579 --> 8064.659
gaining wisdom

8062.26 --> 8067.84
but yeah I don't care if the mood like

8064.659 --> 8069.46
at that point [ __ ] democracy like [ __ ]

8067.84 --> 8072.400000000001
them there have been too many people

8069.46 --> 8074.4
that will literally vote themselves to

8072.4 --> 8076.179
death

8074.4 --> 8079.179
[ __ ] that

8076.179 --> 8083.26
has to be a practical solution and we

8079.179 --> 8086.02
will not give a [ __ ] what people think

8083.26 --> 8088.679
about it yeah you can all [ __ ] kill

8086.02 --> 8091.780000000001
yourselves if you don't like it

8088.679 --> 8095.7390000000005
there needs to be practical solutions

8091.78 --> 8096.82
that fix it and [ __ ] your democracy

8095.739 --> 8099.339999999999
yeah

8096.82 --> 8101.679
just be happy that you'll be able to be

8099.34 --> 8104.4400000000005
still free to blabber all your horse

8101.679 --> 8106.599
[ __ ] and lies

8104.44 --> 8109.598999999999
that you won't be arrested for that just

8106.599 --> 8111.88
be happy about that yeah and it's gonna

8109.599 --> 8114.099
be fixed and we don't give a [ __ ] what

8111.88 --> 8115.659000000001
people think

8114.099 --> 8118.4800000000005
about it

8115.659 --> 8120.94
that's that would be my policy

8118.48 --> 8123.879999999999
like I'm gonna fix it and give a [ __ ]

8120.94 --> 8127.32
what you guys think about it

8123.88 --> 8127.32
it's going to be fixed

8139.0 --> 8141.599
foreign

8156.96 --> 8160.079
it is

8162.04 --> 8167.56
right so I've been going two hours 15

8165.4 --> 8170.32
minutes

8167.56 --> 8172.860000000001
thinking of maneuvering towards rounding

8170.32 --> 8172.86
out the show

8173.32 --> 8176.67
[Music]

8178.06 --> 8185.280000000001
I've still not received any PayPal

8182.5 --> 8185.28
so yeah

8188.32 --> 8192.099
I think despite everything it's been an

8189.94 --> 8195.84
interesting show

8192.099 --> 8195.84
a bit complainy but hey

8198.099 --> 8201.939
righteous anger mode always has you

8200.26 --> 8203.11
pumped up I know it does tear it I know

8201.939 --> 8206.209
it does

8203.11 --> 8206.209
[Music]

8207.28 --> 8212.74
no it's just my attitude it's like oh a

8210.399 --> 8214.84
government well I'm gonna very much be a

8212.74 --> 8216.76
government of force

8214.84 --> 8218.92
but that doesn't mean I'm just gonna be

8216.76 --> 8221.5
forceful to like me

8218.92 --> 8223.78
I do with anyone no not for that but to

8221.5 --> 8226.66
like yeah because some things just need

8223.78 --> 8229.12
to be quickly done it's like yeah we're

8226.66 --> 8230.92
not gonna have a discussion about this

8229.12 --> 8234.34
We're not gonna wait on a bunch of

8230.92 --> 8235.559
people to vote we're just going to do it

8234.34 --> 8240.04
now

8235.559 --> 8243.24
fix it now as in immediately

8240.04 --> 8249.34
no more waiting no more

8243.24 --> 8249.34
bureaucracy fix it now immediately

8250.84 --> 8256.66
that would be my attitude

8253.359 --> 8259.960000000001
that would be my position

8256.66 --> 8264.059
yeah I'm still on steamy Traveler

8259.96 --> 8264.059
it might be the last time for a while

8269.859 --> 8274.479000000001
yes turret I know I've told you about

8272.5 --> 8277.26
that on my show

8274.479 --> 8277.26
it's coming

8277.899 --> 8283.92
but this time all the measures

8281.76 --> 8286.599
are already

8283.92 --> 8289.359
disclaimed to be functional by the very

8286.599 --> 8292.359
people that force them on you in the

8289.359 --> 8293.979000000001
previous time they rolled this out so

8292.359 --> 8295.24
it's going to look very different this

8293.979 --> 8298.599
time

8295.24 --> 8300.939
what yeah what I am out of money and I'm

8298.599 --> 8305.460000000001
not gonna do any show if I don't get

8300.939 --> 8305.460000000001
support before one o'clock tomorrow

8306.04 --> 8312.460000000001
and I won't do it until I do

8309.46 --> 8314.979
and if I don't get any for a few days

8312.46 --> 8316.3
then I'm gonna permanently stop the

8314.979 --> 8318.76
early bird show

8316.3 --> 8321.46
like it doesn't matter anymore if nobody

8318.76 --> 8323.859
can afford to support me I can't keep

8321.46 --> 8326.259999999998
going like this literally I will not

8323.859 --> 8330.300000000001
have money to eat

8326.26 --> 8330.300000000001
I will not have money to eat tomorrow

8333.939 --> 8339.880000000001
and it's unacceptable

8337.0 --> 8343.0
and so that's why

8339.88 --> 8345.358999999999
that's why support your local Arwin last

8343.0 --> 8345.359
chance

8346.439 --> 8350.679
make it happen

8348.519 --> 8352.84
find the right people find the right

8350.679 --> 8355.54
fans that look on the sidelines I don't

8352.84 --> 8357.639000000001
know it doesn't matter

8355.54 --> 8358.719000000001
if I don't get some kind of support I'm

8357.639 --> 8361.539999999999
done here

8358.719 --> 8363.759999999998
I'm not gonna be starving

8361.54 --> 8365.859
I'm gonna try to do something else and

8363.76 --> 8368.380000000001
when I do that and I roll into that I'm

8365.859 --> 8370.899000000001
not coming back

8368.38 --> 8373.24
because I got everything energy wise

8370.899 --> 8375.88
Focus wise invested in doing this show

8373.24 --> 8378.039999999999
and everything that surrounds it

8375.88 --> 8380.38
and if that's not enough

8378.04 --> 8382.54
to make me survive then I will

8380.38 --> 8386.018999999998
discontinue that process and that means

8382.54 --> 8388.899000000001
I can't just pick it back up

8386.019 --> 8392.2
because I will be severely demoralized

8388.899 --> 8395.24
to a way where I can't put it back

8392.2 --> 8398.319000000001
together on the inside

8395.24 --> 8398.319
[Music]

8403.78 --> 8408.58
they do carrot

8405.939 --> 8411.04
and it's all gone on rent

8408.58 --> 8413.68
most of it is gone on rent

8411.04 --> 8415.960000000001
and a little extra that I can buy food

8413.68 --> 8419.14
with it's like that one week every month

8415.96 --> 8422.199999999999
where I'm like oh I'm good now

8419.14 --> 8424.84
that's because I get that money

8422.2 --> 8428.26
it's not enough to get around it's not

8424.84 --> 8431.460000000001
been enough to get around since I lived

8428.26 --> 8431.460000000001
here for the first time

8433.479 --> 8436.199999999999
foreign

8451.899 --> 8457.24
yeah I know and seeking power sucks yeah

8454.72 --> 8459.22
we're seeking wisdom gaining wisdom I

8457.24 --> 8461.68
wouldn't as a politician I wouldn't be

8459.22 --> 8463.599999999999
seeking power I would be this is my

8461.68 --> 8465.64
mission this is like the only thing I'm

8463.6 --> 8468.12
gonna be doing here

8465.64 --> 8468.119999999999
[ __ ]

8470.56 --> 8476.019999999999
it's like this is the thing this is my

8474.22 --> 8478.599999999999
contract

8476.02 --> 8480.640000000001
as a politician

8478.6 --> 8482.62
with the government and the rest like

8480.64 --> 8485.22
this is what I'm gonna do is the only

8482.62 --> 8489.1
criteria like I am not going to address

8485.22 --> 8491.8
anything else like this is the only

8489.1 --> 8493.84
thing I will go by these are my

8491.8 --> 8496.479
instructions this is the plan this is

8493.84 --> 8499.960000000001
what I'm gonna do anything else I'm

8496.479 --> 8503.26
going to 100 ignore this is the only

8499.96 --> 8506.319
thing I'm gonna do that's how I would be

8503.26 --> 8508.78
a politician like this is the thing I

8506.319 --> 8510.699999999999
don't care about anything else

8508.78 --> 8514.060000000001
this is it this is the thing I'm gonna

8510.7 --> 8518.319000000001
do when I'm done then I'm out

8514.06 --> 8520.84
and I might think of a new contract

8518.319 --> 8524.14
to drive me as a politician

8520.84 --> 8528.54
but that's how I do it contract this is

8524.14 --> 8528.539999999999
what I'm gonna do when it's done I'm up

8529.3 --> 8532.539999999999
right

8530.439 --> 8534.64
that's how I think all politicians

8532.54 --> 8538.0
should be they should be like

8534.64 --> 8540.039999999999
employees it's like oh you have a plan

8538.0 --> 8542.68
well here's your contract

8540.04 --> 8544.660000000002
when the contract's done and this is not

8542.68 --> 8546.58
on time based it's just like these are

8544.66 --> 8547.84
the things that you are going to do as a

8546.58 --> 8551.14
politician

8547.84 --> 8552.34
and then when you're done you're fired

8551.14 --> 8554.019999999999
just

8552.34 --> 8556.359
you're done your contracts run out well

8554.02 --> 8558.880000000001
we can make a new contract and then you

8556.359 --> 8560.08
have to vow exactly what you're going to

8558.88 --> 8562.899
do

8560.08 --> 8565.84
within the new contract

8562.899 --> 8568.72
and then you must actually do it like if

8565.84 --> 8572.399
you don't actually end up doing it

8568.72 --> 8574.599999999999
then like you don't get paid

8572.399 --> 8575.979
at all

8574.6 --> 8578.74
like oh

8575.979 --> 8581.438999999998
so you didn't as a politician now

8578.74 --> 8584.439
attaining those functions you didn't do

8581.439 --> 8586.960000000001
what you originally said in the contract

8584.439 --> 8591.960000000001
that you were gonna do okay then you

8586.96 --> 8591.96
don't get payment anymore like at all

8593.68 --> 8600.399
right you you can potentially be on

8597.88 --> 8602.679999999998
welfare then like because that's a

8600.399 --> 8605.08
constitutional right of any citizen

8602.68 --> 8608.08
no matter what so

8605.08 --> 8610.24
yeah it's like you don't get government

8608.08 --> 8613.18
pay anymore you just get the standard

8610.24 --> 8614.859
social welfare then

8613.18 --> 8616.6
because you're not gonna kick a

8614.859 --> 8619.359
politician like on the street that's

8616.6 --> 8620.68
ridiculous that would be Constitution

8619.359 --> 8624.42
violating

8620.68 --> 8626.859
but definitely contract based it's like

8624.42 --> 8631.3
you are hired

8626.859 --> 8634.359
under a specific contract for a contract

8631.3 --> 8637.0
period as a politician that's how it

8634.359 --> 8640.24
should happen so that the piece of paper

8637.0 --> 8643.359
literally says what they must do

8640.24 --> 8644.979
like this is what exactly you must do if

8643.359 --> 8647.319
you're going to end up not doing that

8644.979 --> 8650.88
and doing something else then you're

8647.319 --> 8650.88
fired and you don't get payment

8651.46 --> 8657.358999999999
now that would be a political system

8654.34 --> 8657.359
that I could respect

8663.7 --> 8670.26
fifteen dollars

8665.56 --> 8670.26
good for three days of food in India wow

8673.42 --> 8679.62
well

8674.859 --> 8679.62
for me that's like one day of food

8682.54 --> 8690.880000000001
and it would not be very elaborate

8686.14 --> 8690.88
but good enough to keep me fed

8697.899 --> 8701.279999999999
that doesn't have people

8701.859 --> 8708.300000000001
who comes to try 2021 huh

8705.58 --> 8708.3
that's weird

8710.8 --> 8713.399
huh

8715.12 --> 8720.1
spent fifty dollars a month on Snap

8717.64 --> 8723.279999999999
light snacks

8720.1 --> 8725.319
that's a lot of money Derek

8723.28 --> 8728.76
I don't know if I even spent that much

8725.319 --> 8728.76
on Illuminati girl songs

8737.45 --> 8740.79
[Music]

8741.04 --> 8745.319000000001
is a pasty and it kind of cooked

8745.359 --> 8747.960000000001
right

8752.73 --> 8756.01
[Music]

8781.859 --> 8787.54
yeah I don't know

8785.05 --> 8789.46
[Music]

8787.54 --> 8791.979000000001
I mean

8789.46 --> 8794.619999999999
does like things like gifts and go work

8791.979 --> 8798.899
or

8794.62 --> 8798.899000000001
patreon does that work

8804.04 --> 8809.939
does is it like possible to do direct

8806.8 --> 8809.938999999998
bank transfer

8813.58 --> 8818.7
because I tried that like a while ago

8816.46 --> 8821.56
with jado but that didn't work at all

8818.7 --> 8823.359
like literally the money was lost during

8821.56 --> 8826.24
the transfer like he didn't get it back

8823.359 --> 8828.899000000001
either totally insane that was through

8826.24 --> 8828.899
Australia

8830.02 --> 8833.319000000001
so I don't know how that will go with

8832.359 --> 8836.439
India

8833.319 --> 8839.08
it might be that the bank transfer will

8836.439 --> 8841.42
demand like a huge fine

8839.08 --> 8845.28
just to be able to do that

8841.42 --> 8845.28
so I don't know damn it

8848.2 --> 8853.6
transfer to someone else first who

8850.3 --> 8856.358999999999
doesn't yeah perhaps but I don't know if

8853.6 --> 8860.16
Tara even knows anybody like that and

8856.359 --> 8860.16
like how would they transfer it to them

8860.56 --> 8865.3
wouldn't they have to like transfer it

8862.24 --> 8867.819
to them using a bank transfer having the

8865.3 --> 8869.858999999999
same cost and then that person would

8867.819 --> 8873.039999999999
transfer it through paper it seems like

8869.859 --> 8875.979000000001
a bit over the top

8873.04 --> 8878.939
but yeah I mean I'd appreciate any

8875.979 --> 8878.938999999998
donation to it

8880.18 --> 8883.859
if you can figure it out

8885.28 --> 8889.859
and anybody else like I really need it

8890.439 --> 8896.92
if I'm gonna do a live show I'm gonna

8892.96 --> 8899.399
have to see at least 20 euros on my

8896.92 --> 8899.399
PayPal

8900.04 --> 8907.300000000001
and more would be very much

8904.66 --> 8909.46
needed as well but I mean

8907.3 --> 8913.0
because I do need more and I literally

8909.46 --> 8915.64
have run out and I still have weeks like

8913.0 --> 8919.26
more than half a month to go

8915.64 --> 8919.26
I need to survive somehow

8926.52 --> 8930.28
yeah but that's not really look I'm

8928.899 --> 8934.358999999999
appeal

8930.28 --> 8937.6
Bank transfers internationally they

8934.359 --> 8940.0
don't go in a day

8937.6 --> 8942.460000000001
unfortunately

8940.0 --> 8944.76
that sort of thing tends to take a long

8942.46 --> 8944.759999999998
time

8947.74 --> 8950.46
what

8965.5 --> 8969.18
okay Tara I don't know

8972.76 --> 8977.319
not much you're pretty broke yeah I know

8975.46 --> 8980.339999999998
if I Roger

8977.319 --> 8980.34
you're an artist

8980.38 --> 8983.519999999999
it tends to happen

8984.04 --> 8989.94
good to see you by the way

8986.66 --> 8989.94
[Music]

9009.03 --> 9012.169
[Applause]

9016.2 --> 9018.740000000002
ah

9019.2 --> 9023.58
alrighty

9020.76 --> 9026.22
okay that's halfway fiber oats very much

9023.58 --> 9028.02
appreciated fiber oats was the first to

9026.22 --> 9031.039999999999
donate today

9028.02 --> 9031.04
got halfway

9031.92 --> 9035.04
right

9033.06 --> 9036.859
in that case I might do half a show

9035.04 --> 9040.02
tomorrow

9036.859 --> 9042.54
yeah but I really appreciated fiber oats

9040.02 --> 9044.7
thank you for the long-term support even

9042.54 --> 9046.140000000001
though you're kind of poor yourself I

9044.7 --> 9049.380000000001
really appreciate it

9046.14 --> 9051.479
also hope that you're capable of selling

9049.38 --> 9053.64
more of those paintings because I

9051.479 --> 9057.119999999999
definitely think that they are

9053.64 --> 9060.42
of great quality worth the pay that you

9057.12 --> 9063.380000000001
tend to get for that send some dough

9060.42 --> 9063.38
mothers

9067.319 --> 9069.979
okay

9074.76 --> 9081.24
all right so that is a promising start

9078.6 --> 9084.68
thank you

9081.24 --> 9084.68
but we're not there yet

9085.08 --> 9088.859
so I want to see at least another 10

9087.06 --> 9092.0
bucks

9088.859 --> 9095.899000000001
or two fivers

9092.0 --> 9095.899
and that should be doable

9102.0 --> 9106.68
also guys

9103.8 --> 9107.819
and I would understand if you didn't

9106.68 --> 9110.819
want to

9107.819 --> 9113.399
but since everybody is having apparently

9110.819 --> 9116.64
so much job

9113.399 --> 9118.319
and income problems now which is very

9116.64 --> 9120.84
understandable with how the world has

9118.319 --> 9124.14
become

9120.84 --> 9125.819
I'm also willing to kind of like try to

9124.14 --> 9129.06
help you guys

9125.819 --> 9132.24
maybe even spiritually

9129.06 --> 9134.34
to like I want you guys to get that

9132.24 --> 9136.68
dream job and I mean it

9134.34 --> 9138.72
and it's not just because I want your

9136.68 --> 9140.64
income it's just like no no you

9138.72 --> 9142.56
definitely you guys are good

9140.64 --> 9146.099999999999
you definitely deserve that and if

9142.56 --> 9148.08
there's any way I could spiritually add

9146.1 --> 9151.399000000001
to your success

9148.08 --> 9151.399
I will try that

9152.1 --> 9158.899000000001
I could send is there a direct way

9156.12 --> 9164.52
ask a dip question

9158.899 --> 9166.619999999999
uh I guess you could fiber a DJ one deck

9164.52 --> 9170.12
you have to obsess a compulsive

9166.62 --> 9170.12
breakdown tomorrow morning

9171.12 --> 9176.880000000001
thank you fibroids

9173.34 --> 9178.2
but uh I don't know Tara you could send

9176.88 --> 9181.259999999998
it through the mail but that would

9178.2 --> 9183.240000000002
probably take like a month

9181.26 --> 9186.26
so I don't know I just don't know Terry

9183.24 --> 9186.26
I don't know how to do it

9194.479 --> 9199.679999999998
I mean

9196.979 --> 9202.16
shall I make like a gifts and go would

9199.68 --> 9202.16
that work

9202.8 --> 9206.938999999998
I'm not even sure if it would properly

9204.84 --> 9210.319
work here I think because Gibson goes

9206.939 --> 9213.479000000001
like a real North America kind of thing

9210.319 --> 9215.88
but if there's other systems that will

9213.479 --> 9217.92
work that are similar to PayPal I am

9215.88 --> 9220.858999999999
ready to basically

9217.92 --> 9224.359
start utilizing that too if that enables

9220.859 --> 9224.359
you to be yeah support me

9225.72 --> 9228.56
okay

9233.34 --> 9238.14
yeah that's crazy Emma Peel I I don't

9236.28 --> 9241.859
see how that's even possible like how

9238.14 --> 9241.858999999999
can you still struggle

9242.16 --> 9246.5
with the 12-hour [ __ ] that's just crazy

9249.54 --> 9253.92
would send bump into the same problem I

9252.42 --> 9258.960000000001
thought so

9253.92 --> 9258.960000000001
right so if there's any other ideas

9274.58 --> 9280.319
we'll see Emma we'll see

9277.27 --> 9283.76
[Music]

9280.319 --> 9283.76
we'll see if that happens

9284.939 --> 9290.76
maybe I will try I mean if I'm gonna

9287.939 --> 9293.399
discontinue the early bird show then the

9290.76 --> 9296.72
chances that I would at least try an

9293.399 --> 9296.72
evening show would be very

9300.54 --> 9306.359
but I don't like evening shows you see

9303.42 --> 9310.68
you know why I don't like to do evening

9306.359 --> 9312.66
shows it's because I'm not fit

9310.68 --> 9316.14
in the evening

9312.66 --> 9317.539999999999
I don't have my Peak inside I'm kind of

9316.14 --> 9321.119999999999
like

9317.54 --> 9322.439
smoked out a bit

9321.12 --> 9326.939
because

9322.439 --> 9328.02
during my early bird hours I smoked one

9326.939 --> 9330.62
joint

9328.02 --> 9334.439
it's like perfect I get the full benefit

9330.62 --> 9337.02
but yeah as the day goes on eight hours

9334.439 --> 9341.1
or something yeah I've smoked a few then

9337.02 --> 9343.08
and I'm just not gonna be as focused

9341.1 --> 9345.66
yeah that's what I call smoked I don't

9343.08 --> 9347.34
know what else you call that it's just

9345.66 --> 9350.64
like

9347.34 --> 9352.979
at some point I just like I'm not really

9350.64 --> 9355.5
good at communicating anymore it's like

9352.979 --> 9358.019999999999
when it's 12 o'clock in the evening in

9355.5 --> 9359.64
the night I just don't communicate all

9358.02 --> 9362.28
that well anymore

9359.64 --> 9364.939
it's not because I'm stoned I don't get

9362.28 --> 9364.939
stone anymore

9366.18 --> 9372.06
stone is when you just smoked it and you

9369.0 --> 9374.52
get boom that's not the reason it's not

9372.06 --> 9377.42
like I'm boom all day long no it's just

9374.52 --> 9377.42
I'm smoked out

9378.6 --> 9382.439
it's like worn down

9380.58 --> 9384.479
that does happen

9382.439 --> 9388.34
it would happen even if I just smoked

9384.479 --> 9388.34
tobacco I would also get worn out

9390.66 --> 9397.2
it's very simple in the mornings

9393.899 --> 9399.18
in the early afternoon is when I have

9397.2 --> 9401.76
Peak function so I have the biggest

9399.18 --> 9404.58
focus is where I have the best sharpest

9401.76 --> 9407.7
fuel on Spirit mechanics and

9404.58 --> 9410.52
dreamwalking and all of it

9407.7 --> 9412.5
my vocal cords are at their best because

9410.52 --> 9415.859
they have regenerated all the night and

9412.5 --> 9417.859
have not endured a lot of smoking

9415.859 --> 9420.18
it's the best moment for everything

9417.859 --> 9422.880000000001
that's why I do this show that's why

9420.18 --> 9423.979000000001
I've been doing it for almost seven

9422.88 --> 9426.119999999999
years

9423.979 --> 9427.858999999999
seven or eight years I don't even

9426.12 --> 9430.26
remember how long it's been

9427.859 --> 9432.42
that's why I take the time slot it's

9430.26 --> 9434.460000000001
because it's optimal it's optimal for

9432.42 --> 9437.0
everything for everything I can do it's

9434.46 --> 9437.0
optimal

9437.46 --> 9440.06
right

9442.8 --> 9446.58
what about just doing your weekend shows

9445.319 --> 9449.34
in the evening

9446.58 --> 9452.1
yeah but then I'd miss the brilliant

9449.34 --> 9454.52
afternoons my weekend shows are the best

9452.1 --> 9454.52
ones

9454.68 --> 9460.74
I can start an hour later

9457.62 --> 9463.62
and then I can like go on as long as I

9460.74 --> 9466.38
want up to four hours or more and I do

9463.62 --> 9468.359
that now sometimes

9466.38 --> 9470.22
they're my best shows why would I want

9468.359 --> 9475.04
to move them to the evening and then

9470.22 --> 9475.039999999999
start competing with literally everyone

9477.3 --> 9481.14
why the hell would I do that why would I

9479.28 --> 9484.560000000001
want to compete

9481.14 --> 9486.72
like with QE

9484.56 --> 9489.779999999999
and with flat side

9486.72 --> 9493.46
and with Nathan's Premiere why would I

9489.78 --> 9493.460000000001
want to compete with all that

9495.42 --> 9499.8
you really think I'll get more viewers

9497.58 --> 9502.039999999999
out of that if I do that I don't think

9499.8 --> 9502.039999999999
so

9511.68 --> 9517.319
right besides when people get home from

9516.18 --> 9520.08
work

9517.319 --> 9522.72
in the evening

9520.08 --> 9525.62
they don't really want to probably

9522.72 --> 9528.3
listen to me be all

9525.62 --> 9530.04
complicated and high thought and [ __ ]

9528.3 --> 9532.92
they probably just want to be

9530.04 --> 9535.2
entertained and they want just people

9532.92 --> 9537.18
pointing at both arts and hahaha they're

9535.2 --> 9539.460000000001
idiots right that's why watching flat

9537.18 --> 9542.1
side in the evening works just great

9539.46 --> 9543.899
because that's what he typically does

9542.1 --> 9547.56
that's entertaining

9543.899 --> 9551.699999999999
to working people out there

9547.56 --> 9555.24
what I do is not for after work on

9551.7 --> 9558.720000000001
average maybe it is for you

9555.24 --> 9561.8
my stuff is good like before work when

9558.72 --> 9561.8
you just woke up

9565.02 --> 9569.640000000001
enjoy listening to a cook that that very

9567.66 --> 9572.22
funny there protester but you're not

9569.64 --> 9576.358999999999
gonna give me any money for that are you

9572.22 --> 9580.38
so I don't really care for what you like

9576.359 --> 9583.58
I only care for what people like that

9580.38 --> 9583.58
actually will give me money

9589.64 --> 9593.119999999999
compete with me live

9593.64 --> 9598.26
that would be funny

9595.92 --> 9602.04
five routes maybe someday you can

9598.26 --> 9603.06
organize that that could be pretty cool

9602.04 --> 9605.640000000001
I mean it's not going to be

9603.06 --> 9607.8
International though I think

9605.64 --> 9610.34
but

9607.8 --> 9610.34
yeah

9624.18 --> 9627.720000000001
people leave flat size chat a lot to

9626.1 --> 9629.220000000001
watch anything yeah that's true Richard

9627.72 --> 9632.24
G

9629.22 --> 9632.24
including myself

9639.18 --> 9645.24
well look I could do a test maybe maybe

9642.6 --> 9648.479000000001
even alongside the Early Bird shows like

9645.24 --> 9651.479
what if I did compete like on a Saturday

9648.479 --> 9652.619999999999
evening I did a Saturday evening Night

9651.479 --> 9655.74
Owl show

9652.62 --> 9657.54
just me talking or maybe like have the

9655.74 --> 9660.84
more gallon or something

9657.54 --> 9663.0
and just see what happens

9660.84 --> 9666.62
let's see how many people come showing

9663.0 --> 9666.62
up in the chat as a test

9669.12 --> 9673.859
but I mean even if I get a lot of

9671.46 --> 9675.599999999999
attention and people actually do like to

9673.859 --> 9677.7
check me out instead of the competition

9675.6 --> 9679.68
that doesn't guarantee that they're all

9677.7 --> 9684.2
going to just throw money at me okay

9679.68 --> 9684.2
that doesn't guarantee that at all

9691.319 --> 9697.319
so yeah I'll maybe I'll do it in the

9695.58 --> 9699.02
winters by the way I'm much more

9697.319 --> 9701.939
inclined to do such a thing anyway

9699.02 --> 9704.1
because I get much more active in the

9701.939 --> 9707.220000000001
evenings and nights

9704.1 --> 9709.92
than in the Summer where like

9707.22 --> 9712.039999999999
I don't you get kind of mellow in the

9709.92 --> 9712.04
evening

9712.08 --> 9716.939
but in the winter when it's cooler you

9714.359 --> 9719.52
get more focused at night

9716.939 --> 9722.300000000001
so yeah I guess I'll I'll try it out

9719.52 --> 9722.300000000001
somewhere this winter

9731.34 --> 9733.819
right

9740.58 --> 9743.0
foreign

9745.61 --> 9748.799
[Music]

9750.54 --> 9753.439
what's this

9755.52 --> 9758.42
what was that

9760.859 --> 9766.5
hey

9762.899 --> 9771.84
you crazy bastard

9766.5 --> 9774.72
fiber oats you sent me the other ten

9771.84 --> 9777.66
that's cheating fiber oats now I kind of

9774.72 --> 9780.0
feel guilty I literally just

9777.66 --> 9782.84
took a poor painter's money just so

9780.0 --> 9782.84
gotta have a show

9783.6 --> 9789.5
but I appreciate it I guess there will

9786.18 --> 9789.5
be an early bird show tomorrow

9789.78 --> 9795.960000000001
and I guess that I will edit my chat my

9792.72 --> 9800.24
uh my title now because

9795.96 --> 9800.24
Last Chance is no longer required

9822.84 --> 9828.74
it's all through PayPal borders

9826.14 --> 9828.74
yeah

9829.28 --> 9834.78
streamlabs coordinations no streamlabs

9832.62 --> 9837.26
doesn't have donations it's all PayPal

9834.78 --> 9837.26
integrated

9838.2 --> 9841.28
it's like those

9841.58 --> 9850.02
uh streaming platforms they simply

9846.78 --> 9850.800000000001
have a standard PayPal system within

9850.02 --> 9854.1
them

9850.8 --> 9856.14
right that's usually how things work

9854.1 --> 9859.28
I mean they're not that many different

9856.14 --> 9861.899
International paying platforms like

9859.28 --> 9864.359
that money transferring systems there's

9861.899 --> 9866.58
not that many of them out there I mean

9864.359 --> 9870.12
there's a whole lot of them internally

9866.58 --> 9873.24
in the US but internationally not so

9870.12 --> 9875.7
much very very few actually

9873.24 --> 9877.74
it's mostly everything is still like

9875.7 --> 9881.78
forced to be done through bank transfer

9877.74 --> 9881.78
which takes forever and has huge fines

9886.52 --> 9890.479000000001
[ __ ] off protosser

9891.479 --> 9897.14
should I just call you tosser

9894.12 --> 9897.140000000001
yeah I'm not

9897.72 --> 9903.679999999998
yeah I'm not your [ __ ] puppet show

9901.319 --> 9903.68
yeah

9905.1 --> 9910.68
all right ball win and rage win are not

9908.76 --> 9913.2
little sock puppets

9910.68 --> 9916.2
that I get to ooga booga booga with for

9913.2 --> 9918.319000000001
your oh this is so different that's not

9916.2 --> 9923.359
what they're there for yeah

9918.319 --> 9923.359
I am not a puppet show thanks

9926.34 --> 9929.44
[Music]

9929.52 --> 9932.58
yeah potentially

9939.72 --> 9944.039999999999
I've thought of that too Emma po but

9941.939 --> 9947.300000000001
it's gonna be difficult because I have

9944.04 --> 9947.300000000001
so much material

9947.52 --> 9951.899000000001
but yeah I could have like a short

9949.62 --> 9954.78
library of like over a thousand videos

9951.899 --> 9955.92
of extremely concise things that I've

9954.78 --> 9959.1
explained

9955.92 --> 9962.16
and just have that one as a one looping

9959.1 --> 9964.800000000001
clip I could do that it's just that my

9962.16 --> 9967.319
editing software sucks beyond belief

9964.8 --> 9969.72
it's literally intainable

9967.319 --> 9972.359
it's intangible because everything is so

9969.72 --> 9974.22
[ __ ] slow it just doesn't work

9972.359 --> 9977.04
it's like oh I made a mistake oh no I

9974.22 --> 9980.46
have to spend like 10 minutes trying to

9977.04 --> 9983.04
undo everything yeah that's not a

9980.46 --> 9984.66
feasible way to edit videos I'm not

9983.04 --> 9986.819000000001
gonna do that

9984.66 --> 9989.34
that the program constantly crashing and

9986.819 --> 9993.08
[ __ ] I just my software for video

9989.34 --> 9993.08
editing is the worst

9993.84 --> 9997.74
right

9995.22 --> 10000.74
I personally don't understand how other

9997.74 --> 10005.8
people just do it so a lot so much and

10000.74 --> 10005.8
be effective at it so so well I I'm not

10006.2 --> 10012.52
YouTube Creator Studio okay

10009.56 --> 10012.519999999999
I didn't know that

10013.34 --> 10017.54
no I'm not gonna put some content on

10015.56 --> 10020.979
tick doctor immediately gonna kick me

10017.54 --> 10023.84
off just like all the others

10020.979 --> 10027.019999999999
anti-flat earthers will arrive and then

10023.84 --> 10029.479
it's because look if I'd be exclusively

10027.02 --> 10031.52
Flat Earth like Nathan Oakley right

10029.479 --> 10033.319
really only sticking to Flat Earth and

10031.52 --> 10036.439
the rest a bit jokingly

10033.319 --> 10039.199999999999
well I don't do that I dragon all the

10036.439 --> 10041.84
subjects as in everything

10039.2 --> 10044.300000000001
guess what Tick Tock does not allow

10041.84 --> 10046.819
everything so they're immediately gonna

10044.3 --> 10049.22
Shadow ban me for the the subjects that

10046.819 --> 10051.92
I deal with

10049.22 --> 10053.479
is not going to tolerate that at all

10051.92 --> 10056.02
right

10053.479 --> 10059.84
I mean I am

10056.02 --> 10062.479000000001
extremely anti-communist Marxist

10059.84 --> 10065.72
Tech talk is Chinese

10062.479 --> 10067.519999999999
ruled by the [ __ ] Communist party you

10065.72 --> 10070.34
think that's gonna work you think that's

10067.52 --> 10074.560000000001
gonna work are we known Tick Tock do ya

10070.34 --> 10074.56
I don't I don't think that's gonna work

10076.399 --> 10080.358999999999
it's definitely not going to be the way

10078.74 --> 10083.84
out to certainly get a lot of money

10080.359 --> 10085.58
because that's not gonna be happening

10083.84 --> 10087.92
there is no platform that's gonna

10085.58 --> 10090.68
certainly give me a lot of money it's

10087.92 --> 10093.02
suddenly going to open those Gates

10090.68 --> 10095.66
it doesn't exist there is no such

10093.02 --> 10098.899000000001
platform maybe Owen Benjamin's platform

10095.66 --> 10100.88
would be like that and probably not even

10098.899 --> 10104.619999999999
right something that's completely

10100.88 --> 10104.619999999999
outside of any Beast control

10104.66 --> 10110.359
there are no such platforms

10107.02 --> 10112.1
except for maybe like unauthorized that

10110.359 --> 10113.84
TV what they do with it

10112.1 --> 10116.74
because they have complete autonomous

10113.84 --> 10116.74
control over that

10117.859 --> 10122.24
uh

10119.359 --> 10124.34
is my computer really old

10122.24 --> 10126.5
it's

10124.34 --> 10130.960000000001
it's works

10126.5 --> 10130.96
but yeah it is kind of old really

10133.1 --> 10138.979000000001
I mean I had my motherboard replaced

10136.58 --> 10141.5
but it's really like around the same

10138.979 --> 10144.26
mirror so yeah my computer is pretty

10141.5 --> 10146.5
good for a computer that's over 12 years

10144.26 --> 10146.5
old

10146.84 --> 10152.26
it's pretty good

10149.359 --> 10152.26
very efficient

10152.78 --> 10157.34
functional because I don't run the

10155.3 --> 10158.3
hardest software and [ __ ] on there at

10157.34 --> 10161.960000000001
all

10158.3 --> 10163.699999999999
I mean it runs OBS just fine

10161.96 --> 10166.099999999999
and that's really the only thing that's

10163.7 --> 10168.26
actually important

10166.1 --> 10170.84
right it has to be able to run OBS

10168.26 --> 10173.899
without crashing because it's too much

10170.84 --> 10175.819
for it and then I'm good that's the only

10173.899 --> 10178.72
thing that really matters

10175.819 --> 10178.72
in this setup

10180.08 --> 10184.06
and my computer crashes less than

10182.72 --> 10187.099999999999
Nathan's computer

10184.06 --> 10190.0
under obs

10187.1 --> 10190.0
you know that's true

10191.0 --> 10198.2
right but uh yeah good editing software

10194.96 --> 10200.479
I'd have to like get some one-on-one

10198.2 --> 10205.28
contact and then working in our Windows

10200.479 --> 10209.92
yeah I am on Windows Windows 7 still

10205.28 --> 10209.92
works great I'm gonna change it

10224.14 --> 10230.0
resonates with them sure

10227.06 --> 10233.619999999999
Windows Movie Maker yeah that's what

10230.0 --> 10233.62
I've been using it sucks

10233.84 --> 10241.7
it really sucks it crashes it's [ __ ]

10238.04 --> 10244.76
slow it's inaccurate it's like oh yeah

10241.7 --> 10247.460000000001
take this part of the video cut and then

10244.76 --> 10249.92
you listen back yeah that's not where I

10247.46 --> 10252.74
put it

10249.92 --> 10255.439
Windows Movie Maker it really [ __ ]

10252.74 --> 10258.26
sucks or maybe it's just this particular

10255.439 --> 10261.02
version of it that just really sucks

10258.26 --> 10264.74
I don't know

10261.02 --> 10267.5
I've tried it I built the flat cat video

10264.74 --> 10269.18
which is like the only edit video I ever

10267.5 --> 10272.899
made like that

10269.18 --> 10274.7
in 2016 that's I made that with Windows

10272.899 --> 10276.92
Movie Makers I've never did anything

10274.7 --> 10279.979000000001
like that ever again

10276.92 --> 10282.8
took me a long ass time to make that and

10279.979 --> 10285.76
it's probably arguably the dumbest video

10282.8 --> 10285.759999999998
I've ever made

10287.06 --> 10290.14
the most awkward

10291.8 --> 10299.42
and I did it to impress Patricia stairs

10296.06 --> 10301.1
but but that didn't really work

10299.42 --> 10304.28
S I thought this she thought it was cute

10301.1 --> 10306.28
because of cats though

10304.28 --> 10306.28
um

10314.2 --> 10320.140000000001
she was all free computer mice yeah

10317.72 --> 10320.14
probably

10322.0 --> 10329.06
mrpo if I actually want to be a proper

10325.939 --> 10332.2
video editing person I need a lot better

10329.06 --> 10332.199999999999
I need a bigger computer

10332.899 --> 10338.06
it doesn't have to be as monstrously big

10335.3 --> 10340.3
as Nathan's but it would have to be

10338.06 --> 10342.68
better

10340.3 --> 10345.64
it would have to be a higher end

10342.68 --> 10345.64
computer

10355.58 --> 10360.7
all right just consider that if my

10358.279 --> 10363.319000000001
computer is struggling with

10360.7 --> 10366.08
[Music]

10363.319 --> 10369.199999999999
with Windows Movie Maker yeah then

10366.08 --> 10373.18
DaVinci's resolve is going to be a big

10369.2 --> 10373.18
hassle for it too logically

10377.6 --> 10383.42
right but anyway apparently if you

10381.08 --> 10386.0
elucidated before

10383.42 --> 10389.18
you don't need to necessarily use that

10386.0 --> 10391.7
you can use YouTube Creator Studio

10389.18 --> 10394.64
to make the shorts

10391.7 --> 10396.560000000001
I'm willing to get to a point where I'm

10394.64 --> 10399.979
going to try something like that just to

10396.56 --> 10401.96
take a snip and see what it's like

10399.979 --> 10404.479
I'm willing to try that out if it's

10401.96 --> 10407.858999999999
really all browser based then that

10404.479 --> 10407.858999999999
shouldn't be too problematic

10431.74 --> 10434.859

10473.899 --> 10479.42
hours uh I mean three hours almost

10477.08 --> 10481.7
eight more minutes I'm gonna take a two

10479.42 --> 10484.16
minute break 20 gun I don't give a [ __ ]

10481.7 --> 10486.68
protosser

10484.16 --> 10492.16
he doesn't have a channel anymore

10486.68 --> 10492.16
he gave his channel away to Brandon

10492.2 --> 10497.42
I don't know what he's doing

10494.359 --> 10500.54
Round Table yeah that was ridiculous

10497.42 --> 10503.84
though preposer anyway I'm taking two

10500.54 --> 10506.84
minutes break I'll be right back

10617.06 --> 10623.359

10620.84 --> 10625.1
I don't trust you

10623.359 --> 10627.939
as far as I'm concerned you're one of

10625.1 --> 10627.939
those numpties

10632.779 --> 10639.04
not necessarily a super belligerent

10635.54 --> 10639.04
numpty but still

10640.22 --> 10644.8
Brandon gave up that you what they did

10642.14 --> 10644.8
to what

10650.24 --> 10653.24
foreign

10666.7 --> 10672.380000000001

foreign

10761.46 --> 10765.06
[Music]

10778.76 --> 10785.06
I think I'm going to run out of the show

10782.0 --> 10789.46
almost hit the three hours

10785.06 --> 10789.46
and uh chat's kind of slowing down

10790.1 --> 10797.439
I could go on though

10792.859 --> 10797.439
it's not like I'm super hungry or tired

10798.979 --> 10802.938999999998
I'm just gonna run out of things to talk

10801.08 --> 10807.64
about

10802.939 --> 10807.64
or things in chat to respond to

10812.359 --> 10815.68
what's so bad about that

10816.02 --> 10821.359
day of fasting is healthy yeah yeah well

10818.54 --> 10824.42
I already have all of that calculated in

10821.359 --> 10826.880000000001
yeah the problem is not that

10824.42 --> 10829.58
it's only a day the problem is that like

10826.88 --> 10831.619999999999
yeah no more food after that yeah that's

10829.58 --> 10833.359
not fasting that's just literally not

10831.62 --> 10837.08
having food anymore

10833.359 --> 10840.56
yeah and that's not healthy

10837.08 --> 10842.96
eating less because you need to win the

10840.56 --> 10845.42
schedule yeah that can be better for you

10842.96 --> 10849.319
not eating because you don't have any

10845.42 --> 10851.359
mirror food is not fasting that's just

10849.319 --> 10853.899
starving

10851.359 --> 10853.899000000001
okay

10858.14 --> 10863.06
and like the feel of it and the moral

10860.96 --> 10865.339999999998
Sensations that you have is very

10863.06 --> 10867.74
different from when you're fasting to

10865.34 --> 10870.68
when you're starving because when you're

10867.74 --> 10871.939
fasting you can give it up and eat

10870.68 --> 10874.7
technically

10871.939 --> 10878.899
for whatever reason when you're starving

10874.7 --> 10882.399000000001
you can't stop that and then eat anyway

10878.899 --> 10882.399
yeah that's a big difference

10884.779 --> 10889.939
heightens your senses yeah it can also

10887.66 --> 10893.119999999999
stress you the [ __ ] out

10889.939 --> 10894.68
if you don't have any options it can

10893.12 --> 10896.18
really stress you out and then those

10894.68 --> 10899.859
heightened enough senses are all going

10896.18 --> 10899.859
to be blot out by histamine

10905.6 --> 10910.16
yeah that's right Richard G me too

10908.3 --> 10912.08
I do

10910.16 --> 10913.939
only talking about one day yeah well

10912.08 --> 10917.359
unfortunately

10913.939 --> 10918.68
that's not gonna work only one day yeah

10917.359 --> 10923.380000000001
I fast

10918.68 --> 10923.380000000001
on a weekly basis as in

10923.96 --> 10930.5
like two out of three days I don't eat a

10928.76 --> 10933.800000000001
full dinner

10930.5 --> 10935.779
I basically only eat lunch two days and

10933.8 --> 10939.619999999999
then I have one day where I actually

10935.779 --> 10942.2
have a full dinner that's how I eat now

10939.62 --> 10946.160000000002
that's how I already don't really eat

10942.2 --> 10950.140000000001
enough but it's just doable I get a

10946.16 --> 10950.14
partial Advantage from a fasting

10950.96 --> 10953.619999999999
that way

10955.1 --> 10959.18
but

10956.66 --> 10961.46
yeah that doesn't work when the money

10959.18 --> 10964.819
just completely runs out and there's no

10961.46 --> 10968.319
more food at all yeah that's not fasting

10964.819 --> 10968.319
then doesn't work then

10977.479 --> 10981.819
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

10979.1 --> 10981.819
cheating

10985.7 --> 10990.979000000001
fasting is not a sport

10988.819 --> 10993.14
I'm not gonna freaking talk about

10990.979 --> 10995.679999999998
fasting

10993.14 --> 10995.68
okay

10995.96 --> 11000.24
you ate lunch

10997.76 --> 11000.24
yeah

11000.46 --> 11009.16
I don't fully eat then

11003.88 --> 11012.778999999999
I'm gonna be hungry a lot in that day

11009.16 --> 11012.779
and then we're hungry in the morning

11013.3 --> 11019.06
yeah if I'd eat proper dinner every day

11016.96 --> 11021.899
I probably wouldn't even want an

11019.06 --> 11021.899
Illuminati Castle

11023.74 --> 11029.439
cause I'd still be satiated from the

11026.38 --> 11031.3
proper dinner that I had the day before

11029.439 --> 11034.26
when I have proper dinner I don't have

11031.3 --> 11034.259999999998
hunger in the morning

11034.3 --> 11037.08
I never do

11048.76 --> 11055.06
right but I mean active fasting like in

11053.02 --> 11058.12
oh I'm really not gonna eat anything

11055.06 --> 11062.199999999999
today for health reasons spiritual

11058.12 --> 11064.660000000002
reasons yeah that's cute and all but if

11062.2 --> 11067.060000000001
on average you live a life where you

11064.66 --> 11068.319
don't really get to eat every time you

11067.06 --> 11071.56
want to

11068.319 --> 11074.439
it's a whole different game okay

11071.56 --> 11077.14
fasting like that is much more effective

11074.439 --> 11078.52
when you're always when you always have

11077.14 --> 11081.16
enough to eat

11078.52 --> 11083.08
yeah always like there's always proper

11081.16 --> 11085.38
dinner you have like meat every every

11083.08 --> 11085.38
dinner

11086.38 --> 11092.92
then fasting yeah it's a challenge

11090.34 --> 11095.56
but also it's safe because then you have

11092.92 --> 11096.88
the real benefit from turning off your

11095.56 --> 11098.14
body

11096.88 --> 11101.019999999999
like that

11098.14 --> 11102.64
the digestion part just to recover other

11101.02 --> 11104.92
parts and then you have to full benefit

11102.64 --> 11106.599999999999
and then the next day you're like oh

11104.92 --> 11108.58
thank God it's over a proper dinner

11106.6 --> 11112.300000000001
again right

11108.58 --> 11114.64
yeah that doesn't work with me I can't

11112.3 --> 11116.5
have a oh oh the next day oh thank God

11114.64 --> 11119.979
the fasting is over I've plenty yeah

11116.5 --> 11122.819
because I don't have plenty yeah it

11119.979 --> 11122.819
doesn't work for me

11129.04 --> 11133.54
so yeah I mean I'd love to do that but

11131.8 --> 11135.64
then I'd have to have plenty and in

11133.54 --> 11137.800000000001
order for that to happen I need more

11135.64 --> 11142.119999999999
regular PayPal donations

11137.8 --> 11144.16
and then we can talk about fasting

11142.12 --> 11144.92
I don't want to talk about fasting when

11144.16 --> 11152.26
I'm hungry

11144.92 --> 11152.26
[Music]

11163.0 --> 11166.979

11175.18 --> 11178.26
involve fasting

11183.399 --> 11188.019999999999

11303.939 --> 11308.380000000001
it's a hot one today yeah it seems

11306.04 --> 11312.399000000001
pretty warm today correct

11308.38 --> 11313.599999999999
like it went up like eight to ten

11312.399 --> 11315.76
degrees

11313.6 --> 11319.42
compared to yesterday

11315.76 --> 11322.359
was mostly in my like

11319.42 --> 11324.399
regular trousers even with like two

11322.359 --> 11328.359
T-shirts now I'm in my shorts again

11324.399 --> 11331.68
because it's it got a lot warmer here

11328.359 --> 11331.68
good to see you by the way then

11339.76 --> 11342.76
what

11347.56 --> 11351.46
and I'm still like yeah yeah it's

11349.72 --> 11354.099999999999
because Nathan is not doing a live show

11351.46 --> 11357.0
so I just continued I started later and

11354.1 --> 11357.0
then continued on

11357.04 --> 11362.439
it's been a very e-bagging oriented show

11360.64 --> 11367.019999999999
though

11362.439 --> 11367.02
as you could deduce from the title

11367.42 --> 11373.779
because financially I'm not doing

11369.16 --> 11376.42
fantastic despite your really helpful

11373.779 --> 11378.52
support from last week

11376.42 --> 11382.06
which is literally the reason I even

11378.52 --> 11384.34
have anything to smoke today

11382.06 --> 11388.06
if I didn't if I hadn't had that I now

11384.34 --> 11389.68
would have no tobacco or anything

11388.06 --> 11393.58
so

11389.68 --> 11396.1
thank God for that but yeah

11393.58 --> 11398.02
it's rough times for me

11396.1 --> 11400.479000000001
financially

11398.02 --> 11402.52
which is really a shame because I mean

11400.479 --> 11404.92
my performance on my show have been

11402.52 --> 11407.2
great

11404.92 --> 11410.08
better than ever and I wish

11407.2 --> 11413.140000000001
I just get more Finance so I just keep

11410.08 --> 11415.66
going so I could keep focusing on that

11413.14 --> 11420.539999999999
there's so much esoteric spiritual stuff

11415.66 --> 11420.539999999999
is it's getting so clear now

11424.359 --> 11428.979000000001
but yeah I can't maintain that if I'm

11427.18 --> 11431.7
literally gonna Buckle under hunger I

11428.979 --> 11431.699999999999
just can't do it

11431.74 --> 11435.779
like I know that's impossible to do

11436.6 --> 11440.640000000001
so please don't make me stop

11441.16 --> 11447.399
don't make me need to stop

11445.859 --> 11450.34
whoa

11447.399 --> 11452.34
that heck thank

11450.34 --> 11452.34
you

11452.74 --> 11458.1
wow

11454.3 --> 11461.92
again dank I mean dank here is probably

11458.1 --> 11463.54
my longest supporter ever

11461.92 --> 11466.3
I think you might have been one of the

11463.54 --> 11469.479000000001
first people to actually send me money

11466.3 --> 11470.438999999998
through super chats and paypals years

11469.479 --> 11472.96
ago

11470.439 --> 11475.18
and he's still doing it dank is epic

11472.96 --> 11477.759999999998
thank you so much I already kind of had

11475.18 --> 11480.76
a bit of support from fiber oats but now

11477.76 --> 11485.279

11480.76 --> 11485.279
so much dank I really appreciate that

11488.56 --> 11493.5

11490.72 --> 11493.5

I just hope that they can be lucky too

11502.899 --> 11506.439
right

11504.34 --> 11507.939
I don't want to find out one day that

11506.439 --> 11511.300000000001
every loyal supporter that ever

11507.939 --> 11515.319
supported me is all bust

11511.3 --> 11518.259999999998
like I want them to somehow arguably

11515.319 --> 11520.24
spiritually get something directly out

11518.26 --> 11522.34
of it besides just following my show I

11520.24 --> 11525.1
want them to like

11522.34 --> 11528.34
get better at their job find the right

11525.1 --> 11530.5
job learn how to perfectly manage or

11528.34 --> 11533.02
deal with other people on the job I want

11530.5 --> 11536.38
them to be better

11533.02 --> 11539.68
and have more stable income and get more

11536.38 --> 11542.319
income I want to help all my followers

11539.68 --> 11545.380000000001
become better at what they are

11542.319 --> 11547.979
so that they can Thrive and then I can

11545.38 --> 11547.979
survive

11548.439 --> 11553.479000000001
that's what I really want

11551.319 --> 11556.479
and you yeah fiber outs paints on the

11553.479 --> 11558.819
show that's it makes me feel really good

11556.479 --> 11561.84
about myself like yes

11558.819 --> 11561.84
yes it's working

11563.859 --> 11566.34

11568.06 --> 11571.96
and I'm so glad that it works for you

11590.14 --> 11596.34
so I guess that today has been a

11593.68 --> 11596.34
good day

11597.279 --> 11600.42
hope that will continue

11601.54 --> 11606.460000000001
and yeah maybe

11604.479 --> 11608.74
maybe somewhere this week or in the

11606.46 --> 11610.179999999998
weekend I will do like a late show just

11608.74 --> 11613.72
as a test

11610.18 --> 11615.220000000001
if if I feel good for it though

11613.72 --> 11618.039999999999
it's not going to be this evening

11615.22 --> 11619.84
because I'm still like I I drank beer

11618.04 --> 11622.42
yesterday with the

11619.84 --> 11625.66
with the building meeting which was

11622.42 --> 11627.16
worth it but I mean man I'm so glad I

11625.66 --> 11631.42
stopped drinking

11627.16 --> 11634.38
oh my God I'm so glad I don't drink

11631.42 --> 11634.38
every day anymore

11635.08 --> 11641.64
it's

11636.34 --> 11641.64
the Neo to my Michael card what

11644.56 --> 11649.439
what

11646.6 --> 11649.439
I don't get it

11650.14 --> 11655.899
dank you mean is the Neo why does

11653.14 --> 11660.119999999999
Michael Carl popper have to do with that

11655.899 --> 11660.119999999999
I don't get the Matrix inside joke

11662.38 --> 11667.839999999998
it sounds funny though but

11664.72 --> 11669.819
I don't get it I don't get the reference

11667.84 --> 11672.880000000001
like I don't get the reference to the

11669.819 --> 11674.319
Matrix except for Neo

11672.88 --> 11677.58
but what does that have to do with

11674.319 --> 11677.58
Michael Karl Puffer

11682.779 --> 11688.960000000001
isn't is that just the Carl popper

11685.54 --> 11692.319000000001
analogy a Black Swan

11688.96 --> 11694.96
how does NIA relate to the Black Swan is

11692.319 --> 11699.76
this just getting weird

11694.96 --> 11702.278999999999
I mean is the is Trinity the Black Swan

11699.76 --> 11705.16
she kind of reminds me of a Black Swan

11702.279 --> 11707.2
sometimes in the movies

11705.16 --> 11710.52
but

11707.2 --> 11710.52
it's confusing

11720.939 --> 11725.859
the boy who jumped from the building to

11723.58 --> 11727.539999999999
get out of The Matrix

11725.859 --> 11730.300000000001
what

11727.54 --> 11732.7
where

11730.3 --> 11735.24
are you talking about which Matrix are

11732.7 --> 11735.240000000002
you talking about

11736.479 --> 11740.08
is that like the last Matrix you're

11738.52 --> 11741.58
talking about

11740.08 --> 11743.859
number four

11741.58 --> 11746.8
I don't remember that what happened in

11743.859 --> 11748.899000000001
there except for like oh I'm all Broody

11746.8 --> 11750.88
and oh it was all a dream I made a

11748.899 --> 11752.56
computer game out of it and how [ __ ]

11750.88 --> 11756.839999999998
annoying I thought that was it's a plot

11752.56 --> 11756.84
that's the most I remember about it

11757.12 --> 11763.300000000001
and that the uh merov engine is now a

11760.899 --> 11765.599999999999
bum and I thought that was actually kind

11763.3 --> 11765.599999999999
of funny

11770.68 --> 11776.439
and the Matrix oh

11773.26 --> 11778.18
yeah well I barely know that one

11776.439 --> 11780.1
I know it's out there I've not really

11778.18 --> 11782.34
followed that

11780.1 --> 11782.34
foreign

11782.399 --> 11787.3
to the animatrix good to know because

11785.439 --> 11790.899
then I know the why I don't understand

11787.3 --> 11792.22
it I've watched the animatrix like one

11790.899 --> 11795.479
time

11792.22 --> 11795.479
I did not like the style

11832.84 --> 11839.880000000001
right anyhow

11835.779 --> 11839.880000000001
oh man it's past five already here

11844.66 --> 11848.619999999999
right

11846.399 --> 11850.72
so anyway

11848.62 --> 11854.859
I'm gonna summarize and round out

11850.72 --> 11856.42
yesterday party with the the locals from

11854.859 --> 11859.359
the building

11856.42 --> 11862.3
turned out great like it was good I

11859.359 --> 11864.399000000001
actually flat smacked them a bit

11862.3 --> 11866.56
and I think I might be a little bit

11864.399 --> 11869.68
popular

11866.56 --> 11872.199999999999
which is in stark contrast to the Dark

11869.68 --> 11874.66
World Vision memory that I have of this

11872.2 --> 11876.399000000001
meeting yeah I do and I had it a long

11874.66 --> 11879.58
time ago even

11876.399 --> 11881.619999999999
but I could remember it before I was

11879.58 --> 11883.539999999999
gonna go there yesterday

11881.62 --> 11885.819000000001
had that

11883.54 --> 11888.399000000001
that fit this might go really wrong

11885.819 --> 11891.64
but it turned out it was completely fake

11888.399 --> 11894.939
the Dark World memory just like the time

11891.64 --> 11898.84
when I had that kind of weird vision

11894.939 --> 11900.399
concerning the 2019 Flat Earth Meetup in

11898.84 --> 11902.92
Amsterdam

11900.399 --> 11906.039999999999
I had a dark World Vision about that too

11902.92 --> 11908.439
that absolutely didn't happen in reality

11906.04 --> 11911.26
but but very much impressing me before

11908.439 --> 11913.960000000001
it well that's happened again with this

11911.26 --> 11916.899
meeting thing yesterday and it was great

11913.96 --> 11919.179999999998
even though in the Dark World Vision I

11916.899 --> 11921.939
really embarrassed myself and got like

11919.18 --> 11924.18
almost autistic from it it was like the

11921.939 --> 11928.42
worst case scenario result

11924.18 --> 11930.28
and that did not happen at all at all

11928.42 --> 11932.319
I'm actually quite good

11930.28 --> 11935.02
[Music]

11932.319 --> 11938.88
I kind of broke the ice

11935.02 --> 11938.880000000001
and I think they like me

11939.939 --> 11945.12
like even the women kind of like me

11941.92 --> 11945.12
that's pretty cool

11945.22 --> 11951.58
there's a lot of women in the building

11947.74 --> 11953.319
like women like between 30 and

11951.58 --> 11956.16
and 40.

11953.319 --> 11956.16
there's a lot of them

11957.1 --> 11961.779
so yeah

11959.8 --> 11963.699999999999
anyway

11961.779 --> 11965.68
that happened

11963.7 --> 11967.92
what the [ __ ] what do you mean what the

11965.68 --> 11967.92
[ __ ]

11969.22 --> 11972.96
what so what the [ __ ] about that

11977.859 --> 11982.06
there was just a little party right

11979.779 --> 11985.060000000001
outside of the building

11982.06 --> 11987.519999999999
surrounded by chicks yeah uh dude

11985.06 --> 11990.18
protosser I don't know but

11987.52 --> 11993.1
throughout my life I continually get

11990.18 --> 11996.279
unexpectedly surrounded by chicks

11993.1 --> 11997.899000000001
when I was on vacation in Spain

11996.279 --> 11999.58
when I was

11997.899 --> 12002.278999999999
14

11999.58 --> 12004.979
I was just walking around to camping

12002.279 --> 12007.08
and then at some point I was just

12004.979 --> 12010.22
hanging in my Hang mat and then I got

12007.08 --> 12013.14
surrounded by like 12 girls of my age

12010.22 --> 12015.24
that certainly were like a honey giggly

12013.14 --> 12017.099999999999
giggly he's cute and then started

12015.24 --> 12019.26
touching me and [ __ ] like all at the

12017.1 --> 12021.84
same time yeah that's the sort of thing

12019.26 --> 12023.819
that I have actually experienced

12021.84 --> 12026.34
and it always happens completely

12023.819 --> 12028.439
unexpectedly

12026.34 --> 12031.14
so yeah

12028.439 --> 12032.460000000001
me surrounded by women it's not that

12031.14 --> 12035.58
weird dude

12032.46 --> 12039.5
I am actually attractive to women you

12035.58 --> 12039.5
might not think that but I am

12040.5 --> 12046.68
I might not be the most beefiest

12042.84 --> 12049.380000000001
hunkiest big guy but I'm really freaking

12046.68 --> 12054.0
smart I'm really pure

12049.38 --> 12057.599999999999
and I'm like very fiercely male

12054.0 --> 12062.84
and like not bluffy meal but just really

12057.6 --> 12062.84
about I protect my own

12063.0 --> 12066.5
and I radiate that

12069.18 --> 12075.2
you don't seem gay to me

12071.76 --> 12075.2
[ __ ] does that have to do with it

12076.38 --> 12082.199999999999
I don't get surrounded by females

12078.899 --> 12085.08
because I'm gay I get surrounded because

12082.2 --> 12087.779
there's a magnetic response they find me

12085.08 --> 12091.58
interesting and attractive they want to

12087.779 --> 12091.58
know about what I have to say

12091.8 --> 12096.66
also I know whose cat that is by the way

12094.439 --> 12099.62
the white one and it is actually a male

12096.66 --> 12099.619999999999
she told me

12105.359 --> 12110.0
and apparently his name is Cocos

12110.58 --> 12114.18
because he's white yes

12113.04 --> 12117.740000000002
whatever

12114.18 --> 12117.74
I'm gonna call it Kitty

12118.2 --> 12121.16
damn it Kitty

12121.68 --> 12127.34

I do

12142.26 --> 12146.76
that's correct

12144.66 --> 12150.24
because

12146.76 --> 12152.819
not exactly happy about it but yeah most

12150.24 --> 12156.42
men out here

12152.819 --> 12159.359
their 30s and 40s are kind of gay

12156.42 --> 12161.84
not that they're homosexual they're just

12159.359 --> 12165.439
kind of gay

12161.84 --> 12165.439
poof you

12166.5 --> 12171.06
no dank thanks

12168.66 --> 12175.02
anyway not right now there are actually

12171.06 --> 12179.84
organic cheesy poos that are quite nice

12175.02 --> 12179.84
but I'm not gonna do that right now

12183.359 --> 12189.18
it's it's too expensive not worth it

12186.18 --> 12191.220000000001
it's not nutritious enough even though

12189.18 --> 12194.64
it's not that expensive I mean a bag of

12191.22 --> 12199.278999999999
that is now like 1 euro 60.

12194.64 --> 12199.278999999999
and it's great it doesn't make you sick

12202.26 --> 12206.42
that feminist meals ick what

12209.04 --> 12213.479000000001
what yeah the cheesy poofs they don't

12211.2 --> 12216.0
even have MSG in them the organic ones

12213.479 --> 12218.46
really did you know that your organic

12216.0 --> 12220.38
cheesy Foods they don't have MSG in them

12218.46 --> 12222.539999999999
and they're still tasty I don't know how

12220.38 --> 12224.46
they do it

12222.54 --> 12226.140000000001
and they don't make me sick afterward

12224.46 --> 12229.619999999999
either

12226.14 --> 12230.96
which regular cheesy poost absolutely do

12229.62 --> 12234.84
by the way

12230.96 --> 12238.22
I'm never touching that stuff ever again

12234.84 --> 12241.64
but there's organic ones that her

12238.22 --> 12241.64
surprisingly nice

12252.0 --> 12257.04
I get it thanks

12254.399 --> 12258.66
yeah but they're not that effeminate

12257.04 --> 12261.660000000002
they're just like

12258.66 --> 12261.66
Goofy

12261.779 --> 12268.859
like they don't know how to be males

12266.46 --> 12270.66
because they've been pushed around too

12268.859 --> 12273.84
much

12270.66 --> 12278.279
that's why they're like that

12273.84 --> 12280.319
they would have been chuds and Bros but

12278.279 --> 12282.42
then everybody would look angry at them

12280.319 --> 12284.939
and so they're too afraid to be chuds

12282.42 --> 12288.62
and Bros so they're just kind of gay now

12284.939 --> 12288.62
there's a lot of that around here

12288.96 --> 12292.699999999999
I am not one of those

12301.859 --> 12306.66
when they see you mess with their next

12304.14 --> 12308.34
note down

12306.66 --> 12311.039999999999
biaso

12308.34 --> 12312.960000000001
what they saw me maskless during the

12311.04 --> 12314.819000000001
previous lockdown I would literally go

12312.96 --> 12316.56
in the supermarket like yeah no I'm not

12314.819 --> 12319.56
wearing a mask

12316.56 --> 12321.6
and they'd be okay with that

12319.56 --> 12323.64
lots of people wore masks even after

12321.6 --> 12326.479000000001
lockdowns and it's like yeah they're

12323.64 --> 12326.479
just [ __ ]

12328.319 --> 12334.22
they're just stupid

12331.14 --> 12334.22
that is all

12339.18 --> 12344.16
but uh yeah I'm sure they're gonna find

12341.34 --> 12345.18
me very sexy not wearing a mask after

12344.16 --> 12347.16
this

12345.18 --> 12349.02
I'm sure but I don't even know if the

12347.16 --> 12350.76
mask thing is even gonna roll out out of

12349.02 --> 12353.939
here I mean

12350.76 --> 12355.739
it barely really rolled out that much

12353.939 --> 12357.300000000001
the previous time there was so much

12355.739 --> 12361.14
resistance already

12357.3 --> 12364.319
now it's all officially out officially

12361.14 --> 12367.38
even through Dutch mainstream that masks

12364.319 --> 12369.72
don't work according to the medical

12367.38 --> 12372.06
agency that's supposed to regulate all

12369.72 --> 12377.938999999998
that right that's supposed to manage the

12372.06 --> 12381.72
crisis even they say here is the tested

12377.939 --> 12384.84
proof that it doesn't work yeah so

12381.72 --> 12387.3
I don't see even if there's supposedly a

12384.84 --> 12389.04
new Corona crisis I don't see the masks

12387.3 --> 12390.42
rolling out here I just don't see it

12389.04 --> 12394.02
happening

12390.42 --> 12396.54
only a couple of like obsessed numpties

12394.02 --> 12398.640000000001
might be wearing masks but I don't think

12396.54 --> 12399.779
anybody is like willingly gonna go along

12398.64 --> 12402.778999999999
with it

12399.779 --> 12403.859
maybe jobs that force their employees to

12402.779 --> 12408.060000000001
do it

12403.859 --> 12410.279
and that would be it no public things

12408.06 --> 12413.16
not enforced

12410.279 --> 12414.779
it's only contractual I think I I

12413.16 --> 12417.72
predict that in the Netherlands it's

12414.779 --> 12419.460000000001
only going to be the corporations that

12417.72 --> 12421.739
might force their employees to wear

12419.46 --> 12423.3
masks for insurance reasons blah blah

12421.739 --> 12425.46
blah whatever

12423.3 --> 12427.019999999999
but that literally nobody else is gonna

12425.46 --> 12428.64
wear a mask

12427.02 --> 12432.08
it's like outside of the corporation

12428.64 --> 12432.08
yeah we're not gonna wear that

12432.12 --> 12439.68
I think it might turn into that

12436.5 --> 12443.279
I think that's as far as it will go but

12439.68 --> 12445.92
we'll start to see this in about

12443.279 --> 12448.5
one and a half week from now

12445.92 --> 12450.84
11 days roughly

12448.5 --> 12453.239
and then we'll see if this specific

12450.84 --> 12455.899
predictions online that I just gave if

12453.239 --> 12455.899
that will come true

12465.66 --> 12469.56
but anyway yeah protester it's not just

12468.0 --> 12473.46
true most people think it was

12469.56 --> 12475.439
exaggerated it's proven to not be

12473.46 --> 12478.619999999999
effective

12475.439 --> 12479.939
it's not about if thinking if it's

12478.62 --> 12485.640000000001
exaggerated

12479.939 --> 12489.12
the measure has been proven to not be

12485.64 --> 12491.399
effective for what they claim is

12489.12 --> 12493.7
happening and needs to be done it's

12491.399 --> 12496.739
proven

12493.7 --> 12499.220000000001
non-effective officially by the people

12496.739 --> 12501.96
that manage the medical crisis

12499.22 --> 12503.039999999999
officially on television

12501.96 --> 12505.8
yeah

12503.04 --> 12508.68
there's no turning back from that they

12505.8 --> 12512.119999999999
admitted it doesn't work there's no

12508.68 --> 12512.12
turning back from that

12516.359 --> 12521.880000000001
it doesn't matter if people think it's

12518.279 --> 12525.54
exaggerated the crisis managers admitted

12521.88 --> 12527.519999999999
it didn't work and it can't work there's

12525.54 --> 12529.859
no turning back from that

12527.52 --> 12532.62
there isn't there really isn't

12529.859 --> 12534.42
you can't argue your way to the other

12532.62 --> 12536.640000000001
side again it doesn't work it can't

12534.42 --> 12538.68
happen you can Bluff your way to the

12536.64 --> 12540.599999999999
other side but you can't argue your way

12538.68 --> 12544.08
to the other side because they already

12540.6 --> 12547.5
admitted it can't work there's no way

12544.08 --> 12549.66
back from that ever

12547.5 --> 12551.819
can just suddenly start claiming that it

12549.66 --> 12552.51
does work now it doesn't it can't it's

12551.819 --> 12555.719
over

12552.51 --> 12555.719000000001
[Music]

12564.96 --> 12568.979
yeah of course admitting you were wrong

12566.88 --> 12571.319
and you did something really stupid to

12568.979 --> 12574.019999999999
yourself is terrible

12571.319 --> 12576.42
and I'd say I don't think those people

12574.02 --> 12578.939
should be shamed into publicly admitting

12576.42 --> 12582.3
that even

12578.939 --> 12584.34
as long as they just stop right that's

12582.3 --> 12587.22
the only part that matters as long as

12584.34 --> 12589.62
they just stop it

12587.22 --> 12592.679999999998
stop complying

12589.62 --> 12595.319000000001
just stop it just stop does it matter

12592.68 --> 12597.720000000001
what you think how open you want to be

12595.319 --> 12601.22
just stop

12597.72 --> 12601.22
no more compliance

12601.38 --> 12607.619999999999
and if you need some more motivation to

12603.96 --> 12610.739
do that well then realize that provably

12607.62 --> 12616.08
within the scheme of things complying

12610.739 --> 12618.119999999999
makes you a traitor to your nation

12616.08 --> 12620.34
and that's not a stretch

12618.12 --> 12623.279
that's actual

12620.34 --> 12626.34
because based on how many people comply

12623.279 --> 12629.52
with these crazy fictional measures

12626.34 --> 12632.22
the more your country will be burdened

12629.52 --> 12634.140000000001
with irrational measures that are going

12632.22 --> 12635.34
to damage the economy further and

12634.14 --> 12639.899
People's Health

12635.34 --> 12642.66
so by complying you are provably a

12639.899 --> 12645.3
traitor to your nation

12642.66 --> 12647.1
provably

12645.3 --> 12649.979
so

12647.1 --> 12653.399000000001
maybe that'll help maybe they'll help

12649.979 --> 12655.619999999999
you from getting away from this crazy

12653.399 --> 12659.88
these crazy measures that don't work

12655.62 --> 12662.7
don't don't comply don't do it if you do

12659.88 --> 12664.769999999999
you're provably a traitor to your nation

12662.7 --> 12667.849
so don't do it

12664.77 --> 12667.849
[Music]

12669.0 --> 12674.76

need support or I'm in big trouble

12743.64 --> 12750.599999999999
