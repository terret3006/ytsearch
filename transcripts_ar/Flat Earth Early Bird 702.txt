247.439 --> 250.879
that's part of the joke of the video

252.959 --> 258.16

254.72 --> 258.16
the new video yes

259.45 --> 263.759
[Music]

260.88 --> 263.759

264.56 --> 269.84
hey seeking star wars

270.32 --> 273.919
and a koala

274.479 --> 277.68
yeah it's funny because now i'm

276.56 --> 281.199
basically starting an

277.68 --> 284.24
hour later

281.199 --> 286.56
for the us crowd so if for everybody in

284.24 --> 289.44
europe this is sort of the normal time

286.56 --> 292.4
but i guess that the people in the u.s

289.44 --> 296.639
now have an hour

292.4 --> 300.32
extra to wake up so that's i think it's

296.639 --> 300.32
probably more people in my chat right

308.84 --> 311.84
now

312.639 --> 318.16
huh yeah patricia dockery

315.759 --> 320.24
yeah geoshifter has been around longer

318.16 --> 323.36
than i have

320.24 --> 324.0
you know and he's always been making

323.36 --> 327.199
just

324.0 --> 329.68
funny videos i like every time it

327.199 --> 332.639
doesn't matter really how

329.68 --> 333.759
shitty i feel about something like his

332.639 --> 338.08
videos always

333.759 --> 341.36
just make me laugh really no matter what

338.08 --> 341.35999999999996
he has a real knack for that

342.08 --> 348.12899999999996
and you have the funniest of silly songs

344.99 --> 348.129
[Music]

350.84 --> 353.84
too

354.82 --> 357.93
[Music]

369.52 --> 373.44
humor is the best medicine indeed i

372.319 --> 380.319
agree

373.44 --> 382.4
right so

380.319 --> 383.68
damn i did not make a single freaking

382.4 --> 387.28
note from yesterday

383.68 --> 389.36
house silly of me well i do not know why

387.28 --> 392.79999999999995
though it's really because

389.36 --> 394.96000000000004
yeah my back was very low

392.8 --> 397.039
it's better now because i basically did

394.96 --> 400.0
a lot of work on it

397.039 --> 401.28
i spent probably like over three hours

400.0 --> 404.479
yesterday in total

401.28 --> 407.75899999999996
just trying to massage it to get it

404.479 --> 410.15999999999997
straight find the location and try

407.759 --> 410.88
to figure out how i can reach it without

410.16 --> 412.96000000000004
like

410.88 --> 414.56
over stretching other muscles by

412.96 --> 417.52
accident

414.56 --> 419.44
because yeah it's my back now i am kind

417.52 --> 423.19899999999996
of flexible also thanks to

419.44 --> 426.56
all the tumeric i've been using and just

423.199 --> 428.8
having a good fatty diet which seems to

426.56 --> 428.8
help

429.759 --> 437.84000000000003
but yeah it's still very distracting

441.599 --> 445.12
yeah i did watch a little bit of glow

444.4 --> 451.84
busters

445.12 --> 451.84000000000003
not too much what else did i do

452.08 --> 459.35999999999996
yeah i hung around and watched of course

455.199 --> 459.36
the flatters debate premieres as usual

462.88 --> 465.84
there's a lot of gaming

467.68 --> 471.52
if i remember correctly i watched some

470.0 --> 475.039
netflix

471.52 --> 478.639
was it again i think there it was a new

475.039 --> 482.08
star trek discovery episode the second

478.639 --> 482.08
one in the third season and

487.52 --> 490.71999999999997
like it's

491.599 --> 496.319
yeah it well what i read my original

494.479 --> 498.96
assessment of that serie oh so

496.319 --> 500.8
important me reviewing a series i'm like

498.96 --> 503.44
the ultimate arbiter of

500.8 --> 503.84000000000003
new science fiction series whoopty do

503.44 --> 507.28
right

503.84 --> 509.44
well i don't i think i just

507.28 --> 511.11999999999995
i like it because of my cosmogeny

509.44 --> 512.32
interest and i don't know i've always

511.12 --> 515.44
liked science fiction

512.32 --> 520.24
but not all of it but it seems like

515.44 --> 523.7600000000001
they they're changing

520.24 --> 528.24
the format of the series slightly

523.76 --> 530.48
and they did well they they also i guess

528.24 --> 533.6800000000001
well yeah i shouldn't go too much into

530.48 --> 536.399
detail because then it would be spoilers

533.68 --> 538.3199999999999
like literally explaining that the thing

536.399 --> 542.08
the technicals of what is going on but

538.32 --> 545.2
some time travel issue they slowed

542.08 --> 545.6
down just the rate of the camera not so

545.2 --> 547.6
much

545.6 --> 550.32
super shaky oh yeah one thing i've

547.6 --> 552.8000000000001
really figured out now is

550.32 --> 554.279
i think they're starting to utilize a

552.8 --> 556.88
new

554.279 --> 560.32
influencing technique a cinema

556.88 --> 560.32
cinemagraphic technique

560.64 --> 564.8
because i really paid specific attention

562.959 --> 566.8
to this during this episode

564.8 --> 567.92
because it started to still stand out to

566.8 --> 572.0
me and that is

567.92 --> 575.1999999999999
when somebody a character is in view

572.0 --> 576.08
depending on how much the camera shakes

575.2 --> 579.9200000000001
and moves around

576.08 --> 581.6800000000001
a little it's like their nervousness

579.92 --> 584.64
meter

581.68 --> 587.519
i figured this out because when somebody

584.64 --> 591.36
is like really excited or like even

587.519 --> 593.04
whoa then the camera becomes more shaky

591.36 --> 595.76
as it watches them then it goes to

593.04 --> 598.48
somebody that's like being really

595.76 --> 600.24
strict really clear-minded and the

598.48 --> 604.0
camera's super still

600.24 --> 606.5600000000001
and yeah i get it

604.0 --> 607.76
i thought that was actually it's it

606.56 --> 610.3199999999999
doesn't make you as

607.76 --> 611.92
nauseated as that when things are just

610.32 --> 612.9590000000001
constantly just hopping around and

611.92 --> 616.399
shaking now they do

612.959 --> 617.5189999999999
have typical panning shots that they

616.399 --> 621.36
love a lot like

617.519 --> 623.839
always the camera moving now

621.36 --> 625.519
they don't do it as much in the in these

623.839 --> 627.839
episodes as they do that in the

625.519 --> 630.16
previous seasons and i hope they're

627.839 --> 631.6800000000001
gonna lessen it even more

630.16 --> 633.36
because it is nauseating when the

631.68 --> 636.079
camera's constantly moving but

633.36 --> 639.04
yeah they're they've started to utilize

636.079 --> 639.04
just another way

640.72 --> 644.0790000000001
of yeah handling the camera with

642.72 --> 646.48
personal shots and

644.079 --> 649.68
i thought it was interesting to see that

646.48 --> 649.6800000000001
to notice that

650.399 --> 660.72
hunter's photos no i have not seen

652.48 --> 664.88
hunter's photos and capital letters

660.72 --> 675.839
i don't care right but i watched that

664.88 --> 675.8389999999999
um what else

677.68 --> 679.92
uh

683.279 --> 689.8389999999999
i think that's pretty much it

686.32 --> 689.839
just gaming

692.16 --> 695.8389999999999
and oh right oh i had a really great

694.24 --> 698.0790000000001
dinner i'll talk about that

695.839 --> 699.2
why not because this one really stood

698.079 --> 702.88
out i

699.2 --> 705.9200000000001
i had french fries as i typically have

702.88 --> 707.76
and then later yeah i don't know i don't

705.92 --> 709.519
really do it that often anymore but i

707.76 --> 712.72
basically got

709.519 --> 714.32
there were new type of uh chicken drum

712.72 --> 717.519
legs

714.32 --> 718.48
pretty big ones organic of course and

717.519 --> 720.8
they had like

718.48 --> 723.36
special vacuum packaging like the

720.8 --> 726.8
plastic was completely

723.36 --> 729.76
wrapped around it all and yeah

726.8 --> 730.3199999999999
i ate like a lot of it like three big

729.76 --> 732.88
sticks

730.32 --> 735.12
and some broccoli sticks and that was

732.88 --> 736.48
pretty much it french fries before that

735.12 --> 739.44
not during it

736.48 --> 740.5600000000001
and oh my god did that hit spot it was

739.44 --> 742.5600000000001
unbelievable i

740.56 --> 744.0
i baked the whole thing in butter in a

742.56 --> 747.04
lot of butter

744.0 --> 747.04
a small little pan

748.079 --> 752.3199999999999
added a little olive oil but mostly just

750.32 --> 758.1600000000001
a lot of butter was

752.32 --> 761.12
almost half a half a stick right

758.16 --> 762.16
nice it's i love that and i had a lot of

761.12 --> 764.639
butter

762.16 --> 767.8389999999999
felt like it and later then yeah

764.639 --> 767.839
basically when it's already

768.32 --> 773.0400000000001
decently baked through i stripped the

770.959 --> 775.1199999999999
whole thing got the bone out of it

773.04 --> 777.519
and then put it back in the pan and

775.12 --> 781.04
really let it soak

777.519 --> 782.32
and yeah that just hit the spot so well

781.04 --> 785.5999999999999
that i really feel

782.32 --> 786.0
different like after i ate that i felt

785.6 --> 788.399
like

786.0 --> 790.72
whoa what is this it feels different

788.399 --> 791.6
this that chicken like hit the spot so

790.72 --> 795.279
well and then

791.6 --> 795.279
the broccoli was a great combi and

795.519 --> 802.72
oh so i got it again this morning

800.079 --> 802.7199999999999
groceries

806.16 --> 809.36
and i think it even helped somewhat with

808.16 --> 812.639
the

809.36 --> 812.639
of the back situation

812.8 --> 816.56
anyway yeah that's it

819.36 --> 822.639
that was my day yesterday

824.48 --> 829.6800000000001
yeah george sanford is politics remember

827.199 --> 833.279
biden's son

829.68 --> 835.92
is just poking with politics trying to

833.279 --> 838.8
make us talk about it

835.92 --> 840.639
because everybody's talking about it

838.8 --> 842.0
when everybody's talking about one thing

840.639 --> 845.36
then of course everybody else

842.0 --> 845.36
also has to talk about it

848.33 --> 851.499
[Music]

854.079 --> 861.519
avocado sandwich okay seeking star order

858.56 --> 861.5189999999999
glad you enjoyed it

864.58 --> 867.7
[Music]

869.199 --> 875.12
more interesting than butter really

872.639 --> 877.04
organic chicken wings in your organic

875.12 --> 880.399
butter bake

877.04 --> 880.399
i think that's pretty interesting

880.48 --> 886.5600000000001
freaking delicious

884.72 --> 898.0790000000001
what time is the flat earth debate uh

886.56 --> 902.6389999999999
well in 40 minutes from now

898.079 --> 902.6389999999999
because again europe switched an hour

902.72 --> 905.9200000000001
it did that yesterday but i decided to

905.36 --> 909.04
adapt

905.92 --> 911.76
my time schedule still to the old

909.04 --> 914.0
setting because the rest of the world

911.76 --> 916.3199999999999
outside of europe has not changed as far

914.0 --> 920.16
as i know

916.32 --> 921.0400000000001
but today i am switching to the european

920.16 --> 922.639
time because

921.04 --> 924.16
yeah otherwise there's going to be a gap

922.639 --> 926.5600000000001
in between

924.16 --> 928.48
my show and flat earth debates so

926.56 --> 929.3599999999999
everything is now going to start an hour

928.48 --> 931.6800000000001
later

929.36 --> 941.839
until the rest of the world also adapts

931.68 --> 941.8389999999999
their clock if they do

944.92 --> 955.8389999999999
ketogenic diet i what is that again

958.8 --> 965.4399999999999
right yes yes yes but it's it's only

962.24 --> 965.839
the power to change the convention of

965.44 --> 969.839
time

965.839 --> 969.839
because time is a convention of course

974.72 --> 978.32
it's not a real physical thing it's just

977.68 --> 982.0
an

978.32 --> 985.1990000000001
an extract a derivative from

982.0 --> 987.68
yeah celestial cycles

985.199 --> 987.68
okay

991.959 --> 999.04
ketogenic is a lot of meat okido

996.639 --> 1000.32
well i usually don't eat a lot of meat

999.04 --> 1002.88
but in this case i

1000.32 --> 1004.399
i did eat i was just sitting there

1002.88 --> 1008.0
thinking okay

1004.399 --> 1010.72
one drumstick it's probably going to

1008.0 --> 1011.36
be great and if i leave the other two in

1010.72 --> 1014.0790000000001
the open

1011.36 --> 1014.5600000000001
package and i leave them in the fridge

1014.079 --> 1016.56
then

1014.56 --> 1017.68
probably i figured the next day they're

1016.56 --> 1020.399
not gonna be as good

1017.68 --> 1021.519
and i was really hungry so i thought ah

1020.399 --> 1023.6
screw it i'm just gonna

1021.519 --> 1025.679
eat it all i'm just gonna see how that

1023.6 --> 1027.76
falls it's as fresh as it could get

1025.679 --> 1030.5590000000002
because it was like

1027.76 --> 1031.679
it yeah it just got in the store that

1030.559 --> 1033.28
morning

1031.679 --> 1035.76
and i bought it and just thought i'm

1033.28 --> 1039.199
going to do it as as fresh as i can

1035.76 --> 1042.319
and that really paid off

1039.199 --> 1045.679
so but i usually don't eat

1042.319 --> 1045.6789999999999
that that much meat

1048.88 --> 1052.3200000000002
although i think that i guess with

1050.84 --> 1055.52
chicken

1052.32 --> 1056.559
depending on the rest of the meal i can

1055.52 --> 1058.72
eat a little bit

1056.559 --> 1059.9189999999999
more of that compared to most other

1058.72 --> 1062.559
meats

1059.919 --> 1064.8400000000001
oh most other meats i only really the

1062.559 --> 1067.2
only other meat i ever eat is really

1064.84 --> 1070.799
beef

1067.2 --> 1072.799
maybe turkey rare rare occasion

1070.799 --> 1081.84
but i try to avoid that too because it

1072.799 --> 1081.84
it's a little bit acidifying

1084.64 --> 1088.7990000000002
candy berry on youtube for more info

1087.6 --> 1092.799
regarding keto

1088.799 --> 1094.799
nah well not super interested

1092.799 --> 1097.28
i'm pretty satisfied with the way that

1094.799 --> 1100.4
i'm eating

1097.28 --> 1102.24
but if you could summarize it or

1100.4 --> 1104.5590000000002
yeah other than it's eating a lot of

1102.24 --> 1104.559
meat

1105.12 --> 1108.32
then i would get the gist of it again

1107.039 --> 1109.76
because people have explained this

1108.32 --> 1111.039
before it's just that all these

1109.76 --> 1114.0
different types of diets

1111.039 --> 1114.0
it's all just

1114.4 --> 1120.88
yeah systems

1118.16 --> 1123.44
while my metabolism just typically

1120.88 --> 1125.679
changes pretty dramatically and i have

1123.44 --> 1128.4
to follow suit with my intuition

1125.679 --> 1131.039
and if i'm gonna stick to some rigid

1128.4 --> 1131.039
type of thing

1131.52 --> 1138.559
you know low carb high protein

1134.559 --> 1138.559
no sugar right

1138.799 --> 1141.84
that makes sense because that is kind of

1140.799 --> 1144.72
what i had

1141.84 --> 1145.52
for dinner with not having the fries

1144.72 --> 1147.919
with it

1145.52 --> 1149.28
not having even any mayonnaise with it

1147.919 --> 1153.039
because

1149.28 --> 1156.08
well yeah i i don't really combine that

1153.039 --> 1157.679
mayonnaise and chicken because there's

1156.08 --> 1160.48
eggs in the mayonnaise

1157.679 --> 1161.8400000000001
i don't know it's weird how that works

1160.48 --> 1165.44
but

1161.84 --> 1167.52
and broccoli so i guess

1165.44 --> 1169.3600000000001
that that specific mew was kind of

1167.52 --> 1171.6
k2-ish and it felt

1169.36 --> 1173.9189999999999
really great again it was a pretty big

1171.6 --> 1177.84
meal but it was great

1173.919 --> 1178.24
big plate but it i i felt very content

1177.84 --> 1182.1599999999999
not

1178.24 --> 1185.36
super full so yeah and the healthy fat

1182.16 --> 1188.799
the healthy fats the very fresh

1185.36 --> 1192.0
organic chicken meat that was very

1188.799 --> 1194.0
carefully vacuum packaged yeah

1192.0 --> 1195.12
great stuff it's probably one of the

1194.0 --> 1199.039
best quality

1195.12 --> 1201.76
chickens i've had since

1199.039 --> 1202.559
well since my dad made chicken because

1201.76 --> 1206.24
my dad

1202.559 --> 1209.28
gets it literally from a farm

1206.24 --> 1212.24
so that's even fresher

1209.28 --> 1214.799
that yeah fresher that's the right word

1212.24 --> 1214.799
for it right

1215.69 --> 1224.8600000000001
[Music]

1232.84 --> 1235.84
um

1253.919 --> 1256.159
oh

1256.96 --> 1263.8400000000001
saint george where is that sneaking star

1260.84 --> 1263.84
order

1285.6 --> 1294.48
is that southern utah okay

1291.76 --> 1296.1589999999999
all right yeah united states is a big

1294.48 --> 1299.52
place

1296.159 --> 1301.2
very very very big so i shouldn't be

1299.52 --> 1305.84
surprised that there's like five

1301.2 --> 1305.8400000000001
national parks there

1313.52 --> 1316.8799999999999
says the weather still good enough i

1315.12 --> 1320.08
guess it's the united states so it's

1316.88 --> 1322.159
very different from europe

1320.08 --> 1325.1999999999998
like autumn doesn't really affect the

1322.159 --> 1329.7600000000002
united states in most locations as much

1325.2 --> 1329.76
as it does in europe i think

1330.159 --> 1347.679
because there's parts where it's just

1331.919 --> 1350.0800000000002
dry always even in the winter

1347.679 --> 1351.679
like arizona right arizona is always

1350.08 --> 1355.1999999999998
mega dry

1351.679 --> 1355.2
that's what i remember about it

1357.6 --> 1361.12
because like even 20 years ago like i

1359.6 --> 1364.8799999999999
was communicating through

1361.12 --> 1365.6789999999999
social media before the craziness out

1364.88 --> 1368.88
there

1365.679 --> 1368.88
with a lot of people

1370.32 --> 1374.1589999999999
that were also in the united states and

1372.159 --> 1377.6000000000001
i did ask them questions now

1374.159 --> 1379.2
they were much more scatter-minded and

1377.6 --> 1381.36
[ __ ]

1379.2 --> 1383.3600000000001
compared to well everybody that i'm

1381.36 --> 1385.52
dealing with now

1383.36 --> 1387.52
but i still got to learn a lot about

1385.52 --> 1388.0
like what it was like for them in the

1387.52 --> 1390.8799999999999
united

1388.0 --> 1392.4
states in their location so and that was

1390.88 --> 1395.1200000000001
always interesting

1392.4 --> 1395.1200000000001
to hear

1397.919 --> 1401.76
arizona's great in the winter summer

1399.84 --> 1402.08
sucks right because it's way too hot

1401.76 --> 1404.32
then

1402.08 --> 1404.32
right

1411.36 --> 1418.0
thunderstorm season here now

1414.559 --> 1420.96
it's summer oh

1418.0 --> 1431.84
yeah you're in australia right or was it

1420.96 --> 1431.8400000000001
new zealand

1440.4 --> 1443.679
following the weather yeah i guess

1442.32 --> 1445.52
that's what we're talking about right

1443.679 --> 1448.4
now

1445.52 --> 1448.4
australia right

1456.799 --> 1461.9189999999999
what observer one no i don't think so

1463.279 --> 1470.799
our mind simply through our conscious

1467.12 --> 1474.08
observation reconstructs

1470.799 --> 1476.0
a understanding of reality and a

1474.08 --> 1480.3999999999999
framework with that

1476.0 --> 1482.23
within the mind so we create our own

1480.4 --> 1483.52
virtual realities

1482.23 --> 1485.279
[Music]

1483.52 --> 1487.84
based on our own experiences and

1485.279 --> 1487.84
observations

1489.44 --> 1493.44
the actual physical reality i i'm

1492.159 --> 1495.8400000000001
convinced that

1493.44 --> 1497.919
it definitely does exist even without

1495.84 --> 1502.72
anyone to see it

1497.919 --> 1506.0
you know all that i don't know

1502.72 --> 1509.6000000000001
i think that oh everything about that is

1506.0 --> 1510.559
just sci-fi mumbo-jumbo really it's more

1509.6 --> 1513.6789999999999
philosophy

1510.559 --> 1515.76
that got out of control but ooh if

1513.679 --> 1516.72
you're nobody to see or hear it is it

1515.76 --> 1521.76
still happening

1516.72 --> 1521.76
yes yes it is it's very simple answer

1525.679 --> 1534.4
our presence is not the is not the

1529.36 --> 1534.3999999999999
final condition for reality to exist

1537.36 --> 1545.6789999999999
although in an in a twist

1541.12 --> 1549.1999999999998
of fate it might be that our presence

1545.679 --> 1552.159
is required to maintain this physical

1549.2 --> 1556.159
reality because

1552.159 --> 1560.48
maybe if there were no more humans

1556.159 --> 1564.159
like the simulation

1560.48 --> 1566.64
would desolute which simply sees

1564.159 --> 1568.48
gods yeah simulation not your new

1566.64 --> 1571.3600000000001
computer and we wake up

1568.48 --> 1572.72
although sort of but rather the creator

1571.36 --> 1575.84
that actually

1572.72 --> 1578.64
created the physical reality here

1575.84 --> 1579.6
and the realm that it would basically

1578.64 --> 1582.88
desolute

1579.6 --> 1585.279
it would i don't know

1582.88 --> 1586.48
almost be like a pebble that just

1585.279 --> 1589.919
sitting there and

1586.48 --> 1592.64
it it loses its energy because it loses

1589.919 --> 1592.64
its attention

1596.72 --> 1604.159
now this is of course yeah

1600.4 --> 1607.8400000000001
literally nobody alive will ever

1604.159 --> 1610.0
experience this because as i said

1607.84 --> 1613.279
that would probably only happen after

1610.0 --> 1616.24
the last human died

1613.279 --> 1617.6
if that's ever going to happen although

1616.24 --> 1626.94
it should if you're

1617.6 --> 1631.529
if you're yeah thinking biblically so

1626.94 --> 1631.529
[Music]

1639.039 --> 1643.679
did you see martin yet in it no i did

1641.44 --> 1643.679
not

1647.76 --> 1655.84
it seems silly

1668.159 --> 1672.0
right yeah the walking on water thing is

1670.48 --> 1674.88
fascinating

1672.0 --> 1677.919
but i've already tried to reason out how

1674.88 --> 1680.96
that could happen technically

1677.919 --> 1682.0
that maybe if you have mastery of your

1680.96 --> 1686.0
spirit so well

1682.0 --> 1686.0
that you could literally use it

1686.08 --> 1693.12
to try to basically

1690.24 --> 1694.72
change your own physical electrostatic

1693.12 --> 1697.1999999999998
frequency

1694.72 --> 1698.08
and literally neutralize your weight

1697.2 --> 1700.88
like that

1698.08 --> 1701.76
you know what they supposedly did with

1700.88 --> 1704.159
the horns

1701.76 --> 1705.919
to the rocks to make them levitate that

1704.159 --> 1707.8400000000001
idea well maybe jesus

1705.919 --> 1709.76
just knew how to focus that on

1707.84 --> 1713.52
themselves and i think he's probably not

1709.76 --> 1713.52
the last one to ever do that

1714.08 --> 1721.84
i think that shaolin monks also have

1717.52 --> 1724.559
certain degrees of grip on this effect

1721.84 --> 1727.12
that humans might be able to do change

1724.559 --> 1731.36
their electrostatics

1727.12 --> 1735.9189999999999
and i think jesus used it to basically

1731.36 --> 1739.52
cause him not to have the density

1735.919 --> 1742.88
this equilibrium enough for him to break

1739.52 --> 1744.559
the surface tension of the water so that

1742.88 --> 1748.48
the water would seem much

1744.559 --> 1752.0
much thicker to his body

1748.48 --> 1754.32
see like that and

1752.0 --> 1755.2
yeah it would also make sense since he

1754.32 --> 1758.1589999999999
did that

1755.2 --> 1758.96
with other like he gave that power to

1758.159 --> 1761.5200000000002
others right

1758.96 --> 1762.96
like told you you have to believe well i

1761.52 --> 1766.0
think even how that would

1762.96 --> 1768.72
i'm reason out how that would work

1766.0 --> 1770.48
so if somebody is in that state they

1768.72 --> 1773.76
have that power that they are

1770.48 --> 1776.88
effectively as a constant restful

1773.76 --> 1778.399
focus they do that and then

1776.88 --> 1780.88
because of that they could just step out

1778.399 --> 1783.6789999999999
the boat and stand there on the water

1780.88 --> 1785.1200000000001
well they can basically let that

1783.679 --> 1787.6000000000001
resonate

1785.12 --> 1790.1589999999999
literally almost like you would

1787.6 --> 1791.6
magnetize a piece of metal and turn it

1790.159 --> 1793.919
into a magnet

1791.6 --> 1795.84
like that you could make you the other

1793.919 --> 1796.88
one would have to completely surrender

1795.84 --> 1799.76
you know surrender

1796.88 --> 1801.919
believe open themselves up to the other

1799.76 --> 1803.36
person's frequency without fear blocking

1801.919 --> 1806.72
it or skepticism

1803.36 --> 1809.84
and then they might attune as well

1806.72 --> 1812.159
and then the non-believer would not be

1809.84 --> 1814.32
able to attune and drop in the water

1812.159 --> 1816.3200000000002
while the one that really just

1814.32 --> 1818.0
surrenders it

1816.32 --> 1819.6
however they conceive it you know

1818.0 --> 1822.48
whether they oh it's almighty

1819.6 --> 1823.36
unbelievable god or they actually can

1822.48 --> 1825.84
feel like hey

1823.36 --> 1828.799
he is doing something and now i have it

1825.84 --> 1831.279
too i recognize it

1828.799 --> 1833.279
and then they can do it too now that

1831.279 --> 1837.44
might not mean that they are able to

1833.279 --> 1839.76
initiate it out of nothing that requires

1837.44 --> 1841.76
the the real skill how do you initiate

1839.76 --> 1842.399
it how do you spark that frequency

1841.76 --> 1845.919
change it

1842.399 --> 1846.4799999999998
requires a lot of skill shall the monks

1845.919 --> 1849.1200000000001
train

1846.48 --> 1849.76
their entire life for that sort of [ __ ]

1849.12 --> 1853.36
but

1849.76 --> 1856.64
once there is somebody that does that

1853.36 --> 1859.76
i think it's much easier to make that

1856.64 --> 1864.3990000000001
frequency and that effect rob off

1859.76 --> 1868.799
onto somebody else

1864.399 --> 1871.84
i would know because i kind of done that

1868.799 --> 1874.24
in situations it's like copying people's

1871.84 --> 1874.24
powers

1874.32 --> 1878.08
but that doesn't mean that i can then

1876.48 --> 1881.1200000000001
initiate that power

1878.08 --> 1883.039
from then on unless i really manage to

1881.12 --> 1885.5189999999998
master it in the moment like i

1883.039 --> 1887.279
really figure out what is this now

1885.519 --> 1887.84
unfortunately i've never met somebody

1887.279 --> 1891.519
that can

1887.84 --> 1894.559
actually use electrostatic levitation

1891.519 --> 1894.559
abilities and all that

1894.799 --> 1897.84
or weight neutralization because that is

1897.2 --> 1900.3990000000001
what water

1897.84 --> 1902.6399999999999
walking on water would effectively be

1900.399 --> 1903.6
now flying i've never met anybody that

1902.64 --> 1905.279
can do that

1903.6 --> 1908.8799999999999
because if i would then i would

1905.279 --> 1910.24
absolutely try to copy that oh my god i

1908.88 --> 1913.519
would

1910.24 --> 1915.2
but i've seen other people use other

1913.519 --> 1919.2
types of unique talents

1915.2 --> 1921.6000000000001
including like divination

1919.2 --> 1923.039
type things and even medium

1921.6 --> 1925.6
communications and i

1923.039 --> 1926.72
learned my spirit learned a lot from

1925.6 --> 1929.519
that and it

1926.72 --> 1929.919
the the preponderance of this knowledge

1929.519 --> 1932.96
has

1929.919 --> 1936.3200000000002
made me perfect what i call

1932.96 --> 1936.32
staring into the dark

1936.399 --> 1942.9599999999998
and and they're all yeah my inside

1939.84 --> 1946.0
really figuring out psycho digging

1942.96 --> 1947.6000000000001
i've seen other people dig in me when i

1946.0 --> 1949.919
did not understand that

1947.6 --> 1952.48
and i've seen them do it with others and

1949.919 --> 1955.6000000000001
yeah it was very shocking at first

1952.48 --> 1957.44
felt very weak very hopeless

1955.6 --> 1960.32
like oh my god i'm so stupid i don't

1957.44 --> 1963.44
even understand what they're doing

1960.32 --> 1966.8799999999999
but now i do

1963.44 --> 1969.76
now my skills have grown

1966.88 --> 1969.7600000000002
and taken it

1973.36 --> 1981.519
is crying well yes crying

1978.0 --> 1985.2
in a way i can scry too you know

1981.519 --> 1990.64
divining is yeah can

1985.2 --> 1993.919
lead to all kinds of interesting ways of

1990.64 --> 1993.919
attaining information

1997.2 --> 2005.8400000000001
including scrying

2006.29 --> 2010.23
[Music]

2023.679 --> 2029.76
oh what can't understand what is until

2027.12 --> 2029.76
we are not

2030.84 --> 2033.84
uh

2034.159 --> 2041.3600000000001
well right you're blinded to what is

2038.159 --> 2043.919
to what you are used to especially if

2041.36 --> 2046.6399999999999
you grew while it was normal then you

2043.919 --> 2050.879
don't see it until it drops away

2046.64 --> 2052.2400000000002
right just as a very basic example

2050.879 --> 2054.639
it's very typical that a lot of

2052.24 --> 2057.1189999999997
teenagers for example don't appreciate

2054.639 --> 2060.32
their parents very much

2057.119 --> 2061.9190000000003
until something bad happens to one of

2060.32 --> 2064.32
them

2061.919 --> 2065.839
or like they break up and then suddenly

2064.32 --> 2067.44
it means the world and they

2065.839 --> 2069.2799999999997
and then they're mortified they're

2067.44 --> 2071.599
crushed by it but because

2069.28 --> 2073.119
they were always there it was normal

2071.599 --> 2075.679
they

2073.119 --> 2078.3990000000003
they can't feel how important that

2075.679 --> 2081.119
really is they're used to it

2078.399 --> 2081.1189999999997
so yes

2083.44 --> 2087.04
people usually don't realize what they

2086.56 --> 2091.839
have

2087.04 --> 2091.839
until it drops away

2092.32 --> 2097.119
and then if you're lucky enough you get

2094.0 --> 2100.079
it back and after that you will

2097.119 --> 2103.52
often have more appreciated appreciation

2100.079 --> 2106.1600000000003
for it not always though but

2103.52 --> 2106.16
on average

2108.63 --> 2114.839
[Music]

2110.64 --> 2116.16
kind of what bumblebees you mean do to

2114.839 --> 2121.04
fly

2116.16 --> 2121.04
well bumblebees do it through

2121.16 --> 2126.72
physiological they have like literal

2124.96 --> 2129.44
things that

2126.72 --> 2132.16
yeah they're basically rubbing something

2129.44 --> 2135.68
that causes the electrostatic effect now

2132.16 --> 2138.7999999999997
unless jesus secretly had like

2135.68 --> 2141.44
uh yeah like a beetle

2138.8 --> 2142.7200000000003
a beetle robe underneath his regular one

2141.44 --> 2145.68
and he's like

2142.72 --> 2146.24
rubbing that or something i don't think

2145.68 --> 2148.16
that

2146.24 --> 2150.56
that's really the same effect because

2148.16 --> 2152.8799999999997
that is really a physiological thing

2150.56 --> 2154.32
it is a mechanic that is naturally

2152.88 --> 2157.52
designed

2154.32 --> 2160.48
to do that that's not the same way

2157.52 --> 2162.72
that that basically the shaolin and what

2160.48 --> 2164.96
i think jesus was

2162.72 --> 2167.1189999999997
how they do that because that is a pure

2164.96 --> 2168.16
spirit focus it's the spirit that does

2167.119 --> 2171.52
it it's not some

2168.16 --> 2173.2799999999997
physical thing that that allows

2171.52 --> 2176.48
for something like that to happen so

2173.28 --> 2176.48
it's not exactly the same

2178.88 --> 2183.839
but yes nature does utilize

2181.119 --> 2187.839
electrostatics

2183.839 --> 2187.839
for extra levitation

2211.78 --> 2214.8590000000004
[Music]

2217.52 --> 2225.359
but i already kind of i think i remember

2221.68 --> 2228.3199999999997
even how it sort of works because

2225.359 --> 2230.3199999999997
the biggest trick is this all this also

2228.32 --> 2231.2000000000003
kind of falls in line with the whole

2230.32 --> 2233.52
console

2231.2 --> 2235.52
the concept of benjamin don't squirt

2233.52 --> 2237.44
because you lose your energy right

2235.52 --> 2238.72
well it kind of has to do with that

2237.44 --> 2242.8
because i think that

2238.72 --> 2244.8799999999997
you can attain or some people at least

2242.8 --> 2247.2000000000003
can attain pretty extraordinary

2244.88 --> 2248.2400000000002
abilities that will naturally start to

2247.2 --> 2250.8799999999997
happen

2248.24 --> 2252.7999999999997
if they manage to condense their spirit

2250.88 --> 2255.359
more and more and more and more without

2252.8 --> 2256.5600000000004
getting distracted now here's the thing

2255.359 --> 2259.2
the more

2256.56 --> 2259.92
power loaded you are the more it will

2259.2 --> 2263.5989999999997
draw

2259.92 --> 2265.76
the moths to the flame as it were

2263.599 --> 2268.1600000000003
if you can keep it off if you can manage

2265.76 --> 2269.76
to not be distracted which is the

2268.16 --> 2271.7599999999998
primary challenge

2269.76 --> 2273.3590000000004
when trying to attain this level of

2271.76 --> 2276.1600000000003
energy and the abilities that

2273.359 --> 2277.839
potentially come with it

2276.16 --> 2279.44
or if you manage to prevent getting

2277.839 --> 2282.56
distracted then you might

2279.44 --> 2285.2000000000003
do that but it will take everything

2282.56 --> 2286.4
because everything is a distraction

2285.2 --> 2289.5989999999997
everything you've

2286.4 --> 2293.359
ever experienced you've ever dreamt

2289.599 --> 2296.2400000000002
it's basically trying to hold

2293.359 --> 2300.16
a burning hot it's like metaphorically

2296.24 --> 2302.9599999999996
whole trying to hold a burning hot coal

2300.16 --> 2303.839
you feel the pain it's not literally

2302.96 --> 2305.76
burning it's it's

2303.839 --> 2306.88
it's like it's yeah it's kind of like

2305.76 --> 2309.599
the pain box

2306.88 --> 2311.52
but instead you have to keep your hand

2309.599 --> 2315.28
in there forever the pain is not gonna

2311.52 --> 2317.28
increase so much that you absolutely die

2315.28 --> 2318.48
but you're gonna have to like feel it

2317.28 --> 2321.119
forever

2318.48 --> 2323.44
because that's how strenuous it is to

2321.119 --> 2323.92
basically have that level of condensed

2323.44 --> 2328.16
power

2323.92 --> 2330.16
inside of you tendencies arrive that you

2328.16 --> 2333.68
want to get rid of it you want to

2330.16 --> 2335.44
it's too much to load it but if it's not

2333.68 --> 2338.7999999999997
too loaded

2335.44 --> 2341.92
then you don't have enough power to do

2338.8 --> 2345.2000000000003
these kind of yeah tricks

2341.92 --> 2347.92
with it see so everything

2345.2 --> 2349.4399999999996
everything is about not getting

2347.92 --> 2353.359
distracted

2349.44 --> 2356.079
guess what that's exactly

2353.359 --> 2357.44
shaolin monks and all that all of that

2356.079 --> 2359.44
is all about

2357.44 --> 2361.04
where you get the powers from the

2359.44 --> 2365.52
spiritual powers is about

2361.04 --> 2365.52
not getting distracted

2366.64 --> 2370.48
isn't that interesting when you consider

2369.52 --> 2373.7599999999998
for example

2370.48 --> 2375.44
media politics everything is about

2373.76 --> 2376.32
distraction so guess what they're really

2375.44 --> 2378.16
trying to do

2376.32 --> 2382.2400000000002
they're trying to prevent us from

2378.16 --> 2382.24
attaining our natural powers

2390.4 --> 2398.7200000000003
natural powers that restore your body

2395.2 --> 2398.72
that prevents you from

2400.0 --> 2404.64
from just base animalistic behaviors

2403.44 --> 2407.68
that

2404.64 --> 2409.5989999999997
can yeah

2407.68 --> 2412.0
give you new abilities that are very

2409.599 --> 2414.48
similar to creative power

2412.0 --> 2416.16
but not exactly that because it's still

2414.48 --> 2419.359
creative power still comes

2416.16 --> 2421.2
is is based in distraction that's

2419.359 --> 2423.119
something that i figured out so it's a

2421.2 --> 2426.0789999999997
you have to also let that go well good

2423.119 --> 2428.319
luck with that to me

2426.079 --> 2430.48
because that's exactly where that

2428.319 --> 2432.88
freaking creativity came from with me it

2430.48 --> 2433.76
is basically my inability to handle my

2432.88 --> 2439.839
own power

2433.76 --> 2439.8390000000004
especially when i was young

2440.16 --> 2443.44
creativity is a distraction but it does

2442.8 --> 2445.76
yield

2443.44 --> 2448.079
though and there's things to learn from

2445.76 --> 2450.2400000000002
it and it serves a function it can

2448.079 --> 2451.119
influence morality in a positive way all

2450.24 --> 2452.9199999999996
that

2451.119 --> 2454.1600000000003
and it can be used for darkness

2452.92 --> 2458.48
[Music]

2454.16 --> 2461.68
but yeah it's

2458.48 --> 2463.52
it basically transforms

2461.68 --> 2465.52
that tension energy that you could

2463.52 --> 2469.7599999999998
utilize for special abilities

2465.52 --> 2474.24
into yeah creative

2469.76 --> 2477.6800000000003
construction and design and vision

2474.24 --> 2478.839
that's how that works in my personal

2477.68 --> 2481.839
research

2478.839 --> 2495.839
opinion which i've been doing

2481.839 --> 2495.839
my entire life

2499.52 --> 2502.56
so there you go i've basically given you

2501.92 --> 2505.6800000000003
a

2502.56 --> 2509.2799999999997
yeah a very

2505.68 --> 2512.64
big lesson

2509.28 --> 2516.0
the biggest one for most people

2512.64 --> 2519.04
that is the real power comes from the

2516.0 --> 2522.16
ability to prevent getting distracted

2519.04 --> 2524.48
in other words focus power focus

2522.16 --> 2525.839
power and hey what is a better way to

2524.48 --> 2529.319
keep focus

2525.839 --> 2533.7599999999998
than to follow consistent

2529.319 --> 2533.7599999999998
constructive principles

2534.839 --> 2539.92
eh

2537.359 --> 2541.359
how about that guess what i've been

2539.92 --> 2544.8
doing

2541.359 --> 2550.88
this is my way to try to reattain

2544.8 --> 2553.8390000000004
power by not getting distracted

2550.88 --> 2556.079
keep doing the same thing not changing a

2553.839 --> 2556.0789999999997
lot

2557.359 --> 2562.7999999999997
don't get too eager don't rush it

2560.64 --> 2564.0
because when you don't do that you don't

2562.8 --> 2566.2400000000002
it's very unlikely

2564.0 --> 2568.319
you'll end up in panic situations lose

2566.24 --> 2571.359
control lose the energy grip

2568.319 --> 2574.24
drop the ball again right

2571.359 --> 2574.24
metaphorically

2576.079 --> 2582.2400000000002
lose my focus so yeah

2579.44 --> 2583.2000000000003
follow the good principles proven good

2582.24 --> 2585.68
principles that

2583.2 --> 2587.5989999999997
agree with my intuition that agrees with

2585.68 --> 2591.1189999999997
history that agrees with

2587.599 --> 2592.0
other people who would take reality

2591.119 --> 2596.1600000000003
seriously

2592.0 --> 2599.599
and themselves and yeah it works

2596.16 --> 2601.44
it seems to be working for me i feel so

2599.599 --> 2604.839
much stronger than i used to

2601.44 --> 2607.04
i have so much more grip on reality on

2604.839 --> 2609.52
myself

2607.04 --> 2611.359
like creative grip because i always kind

2609.52 --> 2613.839
of knew

2611.359 --> 2614.72
i was never off in what reality was

2613.839 --> 2616.7999999999997
other than

2614.72 --> 2619.04
when i was following the magical

2616.8 --> 2623.599
thinking process

2619.04 --> 2626.0
just which i'm very ashamed of that that

2623.599 --> 2626.0
happened

2626.88 --> 2630.2400000000002
thank god i got out of it

2630.72 --> 2638.56
that was yeah anyway other than that

2634.88 --> 2641.839
just it's it's worked it's working

2638.56 --> 2641.839
i'm feeling stronger

2642.96 --> 2648.4
i still have issues with myself

2646.079 --> 2651.599
with regrets with the ideas that i'm

2648.4 --> 2654.64
never that it's always not good enough

2651.599 --> 2656.6400000000003
i i try to roughly discipline myself

2654.64 --> 2660.0789999999997
regularly it's something that i i don't

2656.64 --> 2660.0789999999997
know why but i need that

2660.24 --> 2664.4799999999996
and if there's nobody out there to do it

2662.319 --> 2667.599
because they can't because they cannot

2664.48 --> 2671.76
attain that position then i must do it

2667.599 --> 2673.3590000000004
i must be that to myself

2671.76 --> 2676.7200000000003
because i have something to accomplish

2673.359 --> 2680.0789999999997
and i need to keep my attention

2676.72 --> 2683.7599999999998
not drift off into comfort

2680.079 --> 2683.76
too much and lose track

2687.13 --> 2691.92
[Music]

2689.839 --> 2691.92
right

2693.44 --> 2698.2400000000002
but yeah i hope that maybe one day i'll

2695.92 --> 2702.48
be able to demonstrate to you guys that

2698.24 --> 2704.7999999999997
i can actually freaking walk on water

2702.48 --> 2707.52
and now even basically explain exactly

2704.8 --> 2707.52
what i'm doing

2708.88 --> 2715.04
and who knows i'll be able to on the

2711.04 --> 2715.04
spot teach other people to do it too

2715.359 --> 2719.839
who knows

2721.44 --> 2728.4
but it would only be attainable for me

2725.359 --> 2730.64
through understanding

2728.4 --> 2732.0
understanding the design understanding

2730.64 --> 2735.5989999999997
reality the truth

2732.0 --> 2739.92
which is my core essence

2735.599 --> 2743.44
of what the real power of

2739.92 --> 2745.599
creation is is understanding is just

2743.44 --> 2747.76
knowing what is natural and how it has

2745.599 --> 2751.76
been designed by the creator in

2747.76 --> 2754.2400000000002
unfat unfathomable depths

2751.76 --> 2756.3190000000004
structural depths unfathomable

2754.24 --> 2758.8799999999997
structural depths

2756.319 --> 2759.44
that no human mind could ever attain in

2758.88 --> 2763.119
its

2759.44 --> 2766.56
entirety but you definitely recognize

2763.119 --> 2768.7200000000003
the principles you recognize how it does

2766.56 --> 2770.48
work and how there's for example always

2768.72 --> 2772.839
the counterbalance

2770.48 --> 2774.2400000000002
these natural principles are just

2772.839 --> 2777.92
recognizable

2774.24 --> 2781.5989999999997
people figure that out so there is

2777.92 --> 2785.28
a persistence to the entirety of the

2781.599 --> 2788.079
reality of design and it's up to

2785.28 --> 2789.76
people to basically accept that take the

2788.079 --> 2793.3590000000004
challenge it's not

2789.76 --> 2795.92
easy reality is not easy

2793.359 --> 2797.04
can be easy but even when it's easy it's

2795.92 --> 2800.16
not easy because

2797.04 --> 2803.359
easy has a detriment

2800.16 --> 2808.16
of its own

2803.359 --> 2812.16
yeah so it's almost a

2808.16 --> 2816.319
there is no easy win in reality

2812.16 --> 2818.96
not really there may seem to be but it's

2816.319 --> 2818.96
not really

2822.48 --> 2826.079
if you want to do it for real because if

2824.72 --> 2827.7599999999998
you don't want to do it for real if you

2826.079 --> 2831.76
can't handle it

2827.76 --> 2835.28
then you are going to replace

2831.76 --> 2837.92
reality with illusion

2835.28 --> 2840.2400000000002
magical thinking thinking it works

2837.92 --> 2844.079
differently than it really does

2840.24 --> 2846.0789999999997
not accepting core essence factors

2844.079 --> 2847.8390000000004
for example morality of what is right

2846.079 --> 2850.119
and wrong

2847.839 --> 2851.7599999999998
if you don't accept them then you are

2850.119 --> 2855.6800000000003
misattuned and you

2851.76 --> 2855.6800000000003
embrace magical thinking

2855.76 --> 2859.44
you embrace the darkness and you think

2857.839 --> 2862.5589999999997
of it as light

2859.44 --> 2865.44
you might be able to reason it out

2862.559 --> 2866.559
with loads of examples but it doesn't

2865.44 --> 2869.119
make it right

2866.559 --> 2870.0
because only what is right is right and

2869.119 --> 2873.599
what is wrong

2870.0 --> 2876.319
is wrong and that doesn't mean that

2873.599 --> 2877.76
you have to automatically have a very

2876.319 --> 2881.7599999999998
specific response

2877.76 --> 2881.76
to a situation every time

2883.599 --> 2887.76
but to basically say okay we are in

2886.24 --> 2890.8799999999997
circumstances where this

2887.76 --> 2892.6400000000003
has become accepted so you must consider

2890.88 --> 2896.8
it as a virtue

2892.64 --> 2896.7999999999997
that can never be right

2898.839 --> 2901.839
never

2905.04 --> 2912.5589999999997
and if you take it on as right

2908.96 --> 2914.16
anyway then you will go off in the path

2912.559 --> 2917.3590000000004
of delusion and

2914.16 --> 2920.64
it will dismantle your

2917.359 --> 2921.2
character and spirit cohesion because

2920.64 --> 2924.48
you're

2921.2 --> 2927.52
no longer in attunement

2924.48 --> 2929.28
in ascension towards god you are saying

2927.52 --> 2933.2
no i know it better

2929.28 --> 2938.88
i believe in this it contradicts

2933.2 --> 2938.8799999999997
reality but i think i can make it so

2941.2 --> 2946.0
yeah now that is the core essence of

2944.839 --> 2949.2
luciferianism

2946.0 --> 2950.96
if you knowingly do that but a lot of

2949.2 --> 2953.04
people also do it

2950.96 --> 2954.319
without even actually realizing because

2953.04 --> 2956.079
they're just thinking

2954.319 --> 2958.319
this is normal right because they're in

2956.079 --> 2960.8
circles where that is forwarded as

2958.319 --> 2960.8
normal

2961.2 --> 2970.72
at the top they know

2965.76 --> 2973.92
it's luciferian

2970.72 --> 2978.16
and they wants it they want to

2973.92 --> 2980.7200000000003
feel that illusion

2978.16 --> 2982.16
that they are in power that they are the

2980.72 --> 2984.9599999999996
little gods

2982.16 --> 2986.72
that they can be even maybe that god

2984.96 --> 2987.359
allows it but they don't really

2986.72 --> 2990.24
understand

2987.359 --> 2992.4
what the real circumstances often are of

2990.24 --> 2994.72
how he allows it

2992.4 --> 2994.7200000000003
why

2995.44 --> 3001.04
but yeah not all luciferians in my

2999.839 --> 3003.839
opinion and this is

3001.04 --> 3004.64
they're different i compartmentalize it

3003.839 --> 3007.839
from

3004.64 --> 3011.5989999999997
real satan worshippers from

3007.839 --> 3014.16
the real evil ones luciferians are more

3011.599 --> 3014.1600000000003
like just

3015.28 --> 3021.76
well yeah people that want it their own

3019.599 --> 3024.88
way often

3021.76 --> 3026.2400000000002
just can't adapt in certain ways and

3024.88 --> 3030.1600000000003
that kind of thing it's

3026.24 --> 3033.2799999999997
they're not necessarily all evil

3030.16 --> 3035.68
but yeah you know that's just

3033.28 --> 3037.0400000000004
from i guess my experience with some of

3035.68 --> 3039.5989999999997
them

3037.04 --> 3040.72
it's just very difficult to explain in

3039.599 --> 3043.2000000000003
this time and age

3040.72 --> 3045.9199999999996
just like yeah luciferians of course

3043.2 --> 3049.04
that is the satanist and so yeah

3045.92 --> 3050.64
the word has become so convoluted being

3049.04 --> 3055.2
specific

3050.64 --> 3057.5989999999997
it just doesn't work anymore

3055.2 --> 3057.5989999999997
i think

3058.48 --> 3063.2
you probably realize what i'm talking

3060.96 --> 3063.2
about

3063.28 --> 3068.079
luciferianism is now so unbelievably

3065.92 --> 3070.7200000000003
convoluted because of just the hypes

3068.079 --> 3072.6400000000003
and the conspiracy theories that the

3070.72 --> 3076.3999999999996
word

3072.64 --> 3083.7599999999998
just means the ultimate darkness

3076.4 --> 3087.119
it didn't used to though

3083.76 --> 3093.0400000000004
it's it's complicated

3087.119 --> 3093.04
anyway it's still best to just

3094.64 --> 3099.7599999999998
look if you're going to be rebellious be

3097.2 --> 3104.319
it for the good

3099.76 --> 3107.8390000000004
you know and then is it still

3104.319 --> 3110.24
luciferian or are you just

3107.839 --> 3112.48
yeah it's complicated i don't even know

3110.24 --> 3114.0789999999997
man that's why i say i'm a christian but

3112.48 --> 3115.359
yeah when you compare me to a lot of

3114.079 --> 3119.599
christians

3115.359 --> 3119.5989999999997
am i really that typical a christian

3120.559 --> 3126.88
i don't know and it's very confusing

3124.0 --> 3127.68
to me even sometimes like what am i i'm

3126.88 --> 3130.7200000000003
just

3127.68 --> 3134.8799999999997
i'm doing it the way i'm doing it

3130.72 --> 3138.24
and i the best way to describe it for me

3134.88 --> 3139.04
is that i'm an esoteric christian now of

3138.24 --> 3144.4799999999996
course the word

3139.04 --> 3144.48
esoteric is also become very convoluted

3144.72 --> 3151.68
which is very unfortunate

3148.0 --> 3156.319
but it's yeah i call it esoteric because

3151.68 --> 3160.5589999999997
of the dichotomy between acetarism

3156.319 --> 3162.5589999999997
and exeterism i picked up on that

3160.559 --> 3166.3190000000004
a while ago and i thought it was a

3162.559 --> 3169.8390000000004
really good dichotomy to use

3166.319 --> 3172.079
and in the face of that duality

3169.839 --> 3173.119
i call myself an esoteric christian

3172.079 --> 3176.2400000000002
because i focus

3173.119 --> 3180.8
on the core meaning on the essence on

3176.24 --> 3181.1189999999997
on the undescribable part that can only

3180.8 --> 3184.559
be

3181.119 --> 3186.48
felt and recognized that is what i focus

3184.559 --> 3189.3590000000004
on

3186.48 --> 3190.8
in my learning journey that is my main

3189.359 --> 3193.68
arbiter that's my

3190.8 --> 3196.96
where the decisions are made and i'm not

3193.68 --> 3200.319
easily misled anymore i used to be

3196.96 --> 3201.52
so i like 20 years ago i would not be

3200.319 --> 3205.2799999999997
able to do

3201.52 --> 3209.28
this without

3205.28 --> 3211.3590000000004
risking a lot risking getting fooled in

3209.28 --> 3214.559
a big big way

3211.359 --> 3222.4
in a dangerous way but now

3214.559 --> 3225.6800000000003
now i can do it i feel i can

3222.4 --> 3227.52
and that's what i have been doing also

3225.68 --> 3230.7999999999997
with my youtube

3227.52 --> 3236.079
exploits here

3230.8 --> 3238.079
right so

3236.079 --> 3240.7200000000003
i hope you all appreciated that i'm

3238.079 --> 3243.52
definitely gonna watch this one back

3240.72 --> 3245.839
because i think i put out a lot in here

3243.52 --> 3247.92
especially the electrostatics

3245.839 --> 3249.2
it's very interesting to think about

3247.92 --> 3251.599
that as a concept

3249.2 --> 3253.52
to realize that there may be abilities

3251.599 --> 3254.7200000000003
just around the corner that were always

3253.52 --> 3258.4
there

3254.72 --> 3261.839
that are being taken from us

3258.4 --> 3263.76
through distractions and

3261.839 --> 3266.0789999999997
in combination with that we don't

3263.76 --> 3267.76
realize we have it and then that is what

3266.079 --> 3270.96
they're taking away

3267.76 --> 3275.3590000000004
right if you never know you could

3270.96 --> 3275.359
attain it then yeah

3275.92 --> 3280.559
well i figured out maybe maybe i can't

3279.359 --> 3284.48
figure out how to

3280.559 --> 3287.3590000000004
basically regain some of our natural

3284.48 --> 3289.04
abilities that were given to us by the

3287.359 --> 3294.64
freaking designer

3289.04 --> 3294.64
by god himself abilities

3294.96 --> 3300.96
all kinds of because why not

3298.96 --> 3302.319
well the only reason why not is because

3300.96 --> 3307.359
we're not able to

3302.319 --> 3311.04
handle these powers well maybe we can

3307.359 --> 3313.92
maybe we some of us can learn

3311.04 --> 3317.92
to handle these powers and with it the

3313.92 --> 3317.92
responsibility and the dedication

3318.0 --> 3323.359
i am gonna try something

3321.119 --> 3325.359
if i feel it's within my reach i will

3323.359 --> 3327.52
try it

3325.359 --> 3328.88
don't think it's just yet it's not like

3327.52 --> 3331.359
oh next year

3328.88 --> 3332.48
arwen's gonna perform miracles i i don't

3331.359 --> 3335.92
know i don't think so

3332.48 --> 3337.92
at this point but who knows

3335.92 --> 3340.799
i certainly feel like i'm building up

3337.92 --> 3344.079
more power and tension and focus so

3340.799 --> 3346.96
who knows what's gonna be within reach

3344.079 --> 3348.0
anyway i'm gonna round out the show so

3346.96 --> 3349.839
thanks everyone for

3348.0 --> 3352.319
coming i hope you liked the show i

3349.839 --> 3354.799
