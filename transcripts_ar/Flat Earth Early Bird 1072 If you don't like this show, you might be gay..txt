183.0 --> 185.84
so yesterday

186.48 --> 191.04
a flat Earth debates was pretty good

188.099 --> 195.01899999999998
after my show

191.04 --> 195.019
hey by the way my show was great

197.099 --> 201.72
didn't watch it back but like the whole

199.62 --> 205.20000000000002
concept was really echoing through my

201.72 --> 208.68
mind like yes I found another one

205.2 --> 211.67999999999998
another curiosity

208.68 --> 213.84
of the realm to be figured out somewhere

211.68 --> 215.15900000000002
in the future I don't know if it's ever

213.84 --> 219.44
going to be

215.159 --> 219.44
accomplished but it could be

220.379 --> 225.42
right

221.48 --> 228.54
mysterious elusive nature of the Sun

225.42 --> 231.14
and it's light right

228.54 --> 231.14
uh

232.319 --> 237.07999999999998
it's it wasn't super active at the Flat

234.599 --> 237.07999999999998
Earth debates

238.98 --> 244.76
just gave the other guy some room

242.04 --> 244.76
uh

248.099 --> 251.599
oh yeah made by Jim Bob

252.48 --> 255.54
caught that

254.04 --> 257.84
wait

255.54 --> 257.84
right

262.68 --> 267.6
Oh Martin Luther also had another stream

264.6 --> 270.32000000000005
I completely missed out on that

267.6 --> 270.32000000000005
uh

271.259 --> 275.52000000000004
didn't miss out on Jimbo that was

274.199 --> 278.1
hilarious

275.52 --> 282.139
uh

278.1 --> 284.34000000000003
also watched on Benjamin from yesterday

282.139 --> 287.54
finished it up pretty much right before

284.34 --> 287.53999999999996
the show so I'm a little

289.919 --> 295.79999999999995
quite intense

292.32 --> 298.4
basically about like gravel esoterics

295.8 --> 298.40000000000003
and all that

298.919 --> 302.539
kind of makes me nervous

304.02 --> 311.9
we don't know what the sun is Eric

305.88 --> 311.9
dollar yeah hello old Hoss rod down born

328.259 --> 334.68
oh good bro I don't know

331.139 --> 336.96000000000004
I got my pants fixed

334.68 --> 339.78000000000003
it looked pretty good like suddenly

336.96 --> 341.4
there's no more holes in them

339.78 --> 344.23999999999995
but I think they might be getting a

341.4 --> 344.23999999999995
little bit too tight

348.06 --> 351.86
or I'm just like

352.44 --> 355.44
expanding

357.9 --> 363.12
they seem to be a little bit tight about

360.36 --> 365.46000000000004
the gems currently

363.12 --> 368.419
yeah while I'm standing it works just

365.46 --> 368.419
perfectly but

380.699 --> 384.539
I have to get into it

383.34 --> 386.88
right

384.539 --> 389.59999999999997
oh that's better

386.88 --> 389.6
uh

392.28 --> 397.46
I'm gonna turn

394.8 --> 397.46000000000004
weird

397.86 --> 403.62
oh yeah the radiators are on as well

401.34 --> 405.979
that makes sense it's like too warm

403.62 --> 405.979
crazy

411.9 --> 416.88
right so yeah I had a

414.479 --> 419.639
really good dinner

416.88 --> 421.5
chicken broccoli

419.639 --> 424.5
kind of needed that and I went to bed

421.5 --> 428.539
early so yeah

424.5 --> 428.539
but I don't know man

430.38 --> 435.24
still feel a bit wobbly it might be

432.419 --> 439.56
because of own Benjamin

435.24 --> 441.3
sometimes like it kind of gets to me

439.56 --> 445.52
a little

441.3 --> 445.52000000000004
like I zoom in on it too much

448.44 --> 454.34
but it was really interesting

451.56 --> 454.34
uh

462.9 --> 467.599
huh okay xgen that's interesting

468.24 --> 472.8
foreign

469.979 --> 475.62
using a telescope to project the sun

472.8 --> 478.139
onto a piece of paper like a really big

475.62 --> 480.24
Looking Glass basically

478.139 --> 482.599
I mean you could do it with the Looking

480.24 --> 482.599
Glass

487.139 --> 490.379
I don't know if you would be able to

488.639 --> 494.66
actually

490.379 --> 494.66
figure out some spots doing that though

496.86 --> 499.94
hey LSD

504.06 --> 506.78000000000003
uh

521.339 --> 528.08
wow yeah that's very uh creative of you

525.3 --> 528.0799999999999
interesting

528.91 --> 532.38
[Music]

530.519 --> 534.66
I might have done something like that at

532.38 --> 537.12
some point as a little kid too

534.66 --> 539.1
it was like always interested in that

537.12 --> 541.26
sort of thing

539.1 --> 543.0
and my parents were like

541.26 --> 545.16
pulling that sort of thing if they

543.0 --> 547.88
spotted it somewhere and then made me

545.16 --> 547.88
try it too

555.32 --> 561.0600000000001
is Owen Benjamin banned on YouTube yes

558.54 --> 565.019
yes he is

561.06 --> 568.14
still well he has his own platform

565.019 --> 570.899
but he's still open to have people

568.14 --> 574.3389999999999
basically upload his streams but they

570.899 --> 574.339
they all get deleted now

586.8 --> 593.0
right so yeah I just watch him over at

590.1 --> 593.0
bit shoot

598.019 --> 601.16
here's the link

616.62 --> 622.2
an authorized TV with fox day yeah it is

619.2 --> 624.839
unauthor unauthorized dot TV

622.2 --> 627.86
but it is subscription based so you have

624.839 --> 627.86
to pay for it

632.64 --> 636.72
but yeah there's a whole bunch of people

634.079 --> 640.3389999999999
on there Fox days on there

636.72 --> 640.339
and other bears

641.16 --> 645.6
are on there it's becoming like its own

644.1 --> 648.6800000000001
little platform

645.6 --> 648.6800000000001
I hear it's pretty good

650.22 --> 657.24
it has been going Live on YouTube again

653.04 --> 660.42
well he he does like projects where he's

657.24 --> 663.0600000000001
making a new account and then using that

660.42 --> 665.04
to live stream until it gets figured out

663.06 --> 666.3
and then taken down

665.04 --> 669.24
so

666.3 --> 672.4399999999999
yeah he periodically does that I didn't

669.24 --> 672.44
know how to engage it again

672.54 --> 675.079
huh

708.36 --> 711.019
weird

740.519 --> 744.72
the burn and burner Channel

743.279 --> 747.3
oh

744.72 --> 749.519
okay you got a link to that

747.3 --> 752.06
I'll check it out

749.519 --> 752.0600000000001
huh

779.399 --> 781.399
um

818.76 --> 824.48
yeah yeah that's it

821.699 --> 824.4799999999999
oh

824.579 --> 832.459
man I dude I was

827.639 --> 832.4590000000001
like oh my God that feels so much better

832.8 --> 837.26
I was just having Like an Oxygen

834.779 --> 837.26
shortage

852.18 --> 858.06
because yeah it was kind of cold

855.42 --> 860.88
so when I kind of got when I got up I

858.06 --> 862.92
kind of closed the the window and put on

860.88 --> 866.8389999999999
the heater like let's warm this up but

862.92 --> 866.8389999999999
then it I don't know

869.3 --> 877.3199999999999
like a temporary oxygen shortage and

874.68 --> 880.04
it didn't like putting the door on like

877.32 --> 880.0400000000001
this tiny

880.079 --> 886.16
the slit left open didn't really feed in

883.019 --> 886.16
the new Air a lot

887.0 --> 890.12
ah

888.839 --> 892.86
weird

890.12 --> 896.16
like I can't really pinpoint otherwise

892.86 --> 898.44
like why I'm feeling like this because I

896.16 --> 902.899
had great dinner went to bed pretty

898.44 --> 902.899
early haven't done anything weird

911.76 --> 917.639
maybe it's just that the lowering

914.82 --> 920.32
temperature because it is

917.639 --> 923.279
see what is the temperature now

920.32 --> 926.279
[Music]

923.279 --> 928.32
yeah oh it's six degrees now oh it seems

926.279 --> 931.699
to be going up as the day

928.32 --> 931.6990000000001
no that's not right

931.98 --> 937.519
yeah supposedly we'll be going up like

934.86 --> 937.519
to nine degrees

942.779 --> 949.16
I think

944.459 --> 949.16
no no that's tomorrow never mind

955.44 --> 960.48
yeah kind of weird effects

958.139 --> 963.72
well it's like

960.48 --> 966.779
you know in the past few weeks with the

963.72 --> 970.0790000000001
ancestor wins I get like in my

966.779 --> 971.82
in my upper belly like nervousness and

970.079 --> 973.9799999999999
then it kind of makes you feel sick but

971.82 --> 977.1600000000001
now it's different like that's not there

973.98 --> 979.6800000000001
I feel perfectly not nervous

977.16 --> 983.6
but it's like in the lower God it's like

979.68 --> 983.5999999999999
this weird feeling

986.04 --> 990.36
but yeah as soon as I opened the window

987.899 --> 994.759
and like the fresh air came rolling in

990.36 --> 994.759
like that immediately soothed it so

995.339 --> 998.94
maybe that's just because of the

996.959 --> 1001.8199999999999
temperature that the oxygen is going

998.94 --> 1005.0600000000001
down on average or it's harder to absorb

1001.82 --> 1007.339
and that's like my body is

1005.06 --> 1008.5999999999999
like having trouble adapting or

1007.339 --> 1010.94
something

1008.6 --> 1014.6800000000001
that could be it but if that's the case

1010.94 --> 1014.6800000000001
then it should be very temporary

1014.72 --> 1018.44
yeah oh

1019.339 --> 1024.8200000000002
hello seeking star water

1021.62 --> 1024.82
yeah Mountain weather

1025.339 --> 1029.3799999999999
yeah

1026.78 --> 1029.3799999999999
typical

1030.62 --> 1035.6
my girlfriend gets a really bad asthma

1032.66 --> 1039.699
oh that's terrible

1035.6 --> 1039.6989999999998
especially in a world like this

1041.9 --> 1044.74
like it is now

1045.559 --> 1047.74
foreign

1051.52 --> 1055.539
by the way Mike sidonic

1069.559 --> 1074.539
I got this weird feeling also I have to

1071.66 --> 1079.299
like change my diet

1074.539 --> 1079.299
like that's accompanying this transition

1080.0 --> 1084.679
gonna have to think about that

1082.88 --> 1086.419
it's not going to be a massive change

1084.679 --> 1088.2800000000002
it's going to rather be a switch to

1086.419 --> 1092.0200000000002
another setup

1088.28 --> 1094.3999999999999
that I've been used to before this

1092.02 --> 1097.36
let me think like what did I do in

1094.4 --> 1097.3600000000001
previous Winters

1105.26 --> 1108.039
I don't know

1113.6 --> 1116.799
load Jeff gas head

1120.919 --> 1125.7800000000002
right so yeah I don't know how the show

1123.5 --> 1127.52
is gonna go but I feel like maybe

1125.78 --> 1129.44
because of the state I might be just

1127.52 --> 1131.6
kind of reactive

1129.44 --> 1135.38
because yesterday it was like full out

1131.6 --> 1138.3799999999999
right I was I got really inspired

1135.38 --> 1140.72
maybe because of that it's like the down

1138.38 --> 1142.94
to the up of yesterday seems to be

1140.72 --> 1144.44
happening more often like I get a great

1142.94 --> 1146.9
day

1144.44 --> 1149.9
sometimes even two days and then

1146.9 --> 1152.799
suddenly like it just like eh

1149.9 --> 1152.799
that's enough

1154.88 --> 1157.48
uh

1160.82 --> 1165.1399999999999
hello Ibis 333

1165.98 --> 1172.48
go with your gut instinct well my my gut

1168.62 --> 1172.4799999999998
is currently kind of cramped

1188.059 --> 1190.78
foreign

1195.29 --> 1199.1599999999999
[Music]

1196.7 --> 1201.559
I don't know seeking star water I I'm

1199.16 --> 1203.419
not really responding all that well to

1201.559 --> 1205.94
Rice anymore

1203.419 --> 1208.2800000000002
because also I've been eating it very

1205.94 --> 1210.6200000000001
little and then like when I do it it's

1208.28 --> 1212.799
like my body really has to get used to

1210.62 --> 1212.799
it

1222.26 --> 1226.179
hello Fireside Chatterbox

1228.02 --> 1235.1589999999999

1364.28 --> 1367.4189999999999
what's this

1400.4 --> 1402.88
all right

1403.64 --> 1408.76
sorry if you seem a bit distracted well

1406.039 --> 1408.76
because I am

1412.24 --> 1416.38
distracted by my innards

1420.98 --> 1427.779
but yeah if you guys bring up some kind

1423.26 --> 1427.779
of a subject it's if it's not too heavy

1428.0 --> 1430.9
you can talk about it

1439.34 --> 1442.48
oh man

1445.279 --> 1449.919
I think I'm gonna need to take a shower

1447.38 --> 1449.919
after this

1453.559 --> 1458.3799999999999
maybe that has something to do with it I

1456.14 --> 1458.38
don't know

1461.12 --> 1465.1999999999998
hurting if oh there that doesn't sound

1463.88 --> 1466.7600000000002
good

1465.2 --> 1469.8400000000001
I think we gotta

1466.76 --> 1469.84
Fundy and chat

1473.419 --> 1478.22
which observation would invalidate to

1475.76 --> 1481.52
claim the Earth is flat

1478.22 --> 1483.799
there is no such thing

1481.52 --> 1485.779
there's Black Swan observations after

1483.799 --> 1488.9
that point it doesn't really matter what

1485.779 --> 1491.419
kind of observations you present

1488.9 --> 1494.179
it's flat it's not the globe

1491.419 --> 1495.64
there is no observation you can present

1494.179 --> 1498.2
to

1495.64 --> 1500.779
disprove the Flat Earth at this point

1498.2 --> 1503.74
Thomas lesson that's the point of the

1500.779 --> 1503.74
Black Swan argument

1505.82 --> 1508.299
right

1509.6 --> 1515.539
in order to invalidate

1512.6 --> 1518.299
the claim the Earth is flat the world

1515.539 --> 1521.299
would literally have to change around

1518.299 --> 1523.6589999999999
and become a globe and that's not gonna

1521.299 --> 1523.6589999999999
happen

1526.58 --> 1530.8999999999999
how about the Dynamics of the looping

1528.919 --> 1533.3600000000001
Earth or is that too heavy for now not

1530.9 --> 1537.2
not really heavy but

1533.36 --> 1540.9189999999999
you have to talk about what about it

1537.2 --> 1544.1000000000001
I mean you can ask questions

1540.919 --> 1546.5
because for me like

1544.1 --> 1548.299
I have trouble sometimes even like

1546.5 --> 1550.279
understanding what people don't

1548.299 --> 1553.1
understand about it because it's become

1550.279 --> 1555.98
like such a second nature

1553.1 --> 1559.82
way of looking at it for me

1555.98 --> 1562.22
but yeah if you inquire I will elaborate

1559.82 --> 1565.24
absolutely

1562.22 --> 1565.24
as much as you want

1566.299 --> 1571.72
thanks for helping drag in a topic PG

1569.179 --> 1571.72
Cru Shank

1585.919 --> 1594.2
uh my theory of what theory hypothesis

1591.5 --> 1596.24
the Earth being flat is not a hypothesis

1594.2 --> 1599.8600000000001
or a scientific theory

1596.24 --> 1599.86
Thomas lesson that's a

1600.919 --> 1604.96
strange way to look at it

1609.14 --> 1613.5200000000002
right it's uh what is

1611.96 --> 1618.6200000000001
claim

1613.52 --> 1621.1399999999999
not a what causes claim

1618.62 --> 1624.1399999999999
and what causes claim is scientific it

1621.14 --> 1627.14
like that's part of a scientific inquiry

1624.14 --> 1629.8600000000001
what is is not as part of a scientific

1627.14 --> 1629.8600000000001
hypothesis

1630.62 --> 1636.62
it's rather

1633.26 --> 1639.74
anchored in logical deduction and basic

1636.62 --> 1642.399
understanding of mechanics

1639.74 --> 1642.3990000000001
that's it

1644.24 --> 1648.08
Earth being flat is not a scientific

1646.34 --> 1650.6
claim

1648.08 --> 1652.46
by the way Earth being a globe is not a

1650.6 --> 1656.98
scientific claim either

1652.46 --> 1656.98
even if it were a globe which it isn't

1659.0 --> 1661.6
it

1673.1 --> 1677.6589999999999
if you get high enough you saw a curve

1675.5 --> 1680.919
that would invalidate Flat Earth

1677.659 --> 1680.919
uh no

1684.919 --> 1689.659
well yes

1686.659 --> 1691.3400000000001
but how like how do you even know at

1689.659 --> 1692.8400000000001
that point that what you're gonna see is

1691.34 --> 1696.26
a curve

1692.84 --> 1700.279
me maybe it's just the bending

1696.26 --> 1703.48
of the Horizon visual thanks to the lens

1700.279 --> 1703.48
all that right

1704.179 --> 1709.94
in order to claim curve you actually

1705.98 --> 1712.279
gotta approach it geometrically

1709.94 --> 1715.76
you got it first established that the

1712.279 --> 1718.96
Horizon is geometric which would be the

1715.76 --> 1718.96
logical requirement

1719.0 --> 1724.899
if the Earth were actually a literal

1722.12 --> 1724.899
physical sphere

1725.48 --> 1733.24
now the issue of course is it isn't and

1728.539 --> 1733.24
that's why the Horizon is purely Optical

1736.64 --> 1741.5
but yeah if the Earth were a globe then

1738.919 --> 1744.2
the Horizon would not just be Optical it

1741.5 --> 1746.419
would also be geometric

1744.2 --> 1748.5800000000002
because it would physically start to

1746.419 --> 1749.98
obstruct things at a very specific

1748.58 --> 1754.34
geometric

1749.98 --> 1757.34
exponential rate and it doesn't do that

1754.34 --> 1761.0
instead the observation yields a an

1757.34 --> 1763.4599999999998
apparent Optical slant effect which is

1761.0 --> 1766.159
caused by diffraction another Optical

1763.46 --> 1768.08
effect that makes things disappear

1766.159 --> 1770.6000000000001
bottom up

1768.08 --> 1773.899
to The Observer but not because of

1770.6 --> 1776.7199999999998
geometric blockage and besides the rate

1773.899 --> 1779.4189999999999
of the blockage is linear not

1776.72 --> 1780.6200000000001
exponential which would have it would

1779.419 --> 1784.8400000000001
have to be

1780.62 --> 1784.84
if the Earth was a geometric lobe

1784.88 --> 1792.8200000000002
so I hope that settles that for you

1789.74 --> 1792.82
probably not

1793.46 --> 1803.9
huh

1795.97 --> 1803.9
[Music]

1807.559 --> 1812.799
not being able to see the entire Earth

1814.159 --> 1819.2
yeah but

1815.799 --> 1822.44
that's because of Optics that's because

1819.2 --> 1825.82
your site is naturally limited because

1822.44 --> 1825.8200000000002
of different influences

1833.36 --> 1838.6399999999999
right there's a resolution limit your

1835.94 --> 1840.559
eyes can't zoom in naturally

1838.64 --> 1843.7990000000002
camera scan

1840.559 --> 1846.02
and then there's the refraction issue

1843.799 --> 1848.96
because of light having to travel

1846.02 --> 1850.46
through all that air and if yeah

1848.96 --> 1852.919
some point

1850.46 --> 1856.22
the preponderance of the light

1852.919 --> 1858.6200000000001
it of the air it travels through will

1856.22 --> 1861.44
cause a diffusion and then at some point

1858.62 --> 1863.0
that diffusion will cause a complete

1861.44 --> 1865.88
blur up of whatever is there to the

1863.0 --> 1868.279
Observer if they could actually overcome

1865.88 --> 1871.24
the resolution limit

1868.279 --> 1871.24
in the first place

1871.46 --> 1875.24
because yeah everything

1873.44 --> 1878.8400000000001
still shrinks because of perspective

1875.24 --> 1880.82
physical things in relation to the Earth

1878.84 --> 1882.3799999999999
so

1880.82 --> 1884.84
you're always going to have like a

1882.38 --> 1886.88
limited side a circle of you around you

1884.84 --> 1887.72
even on a globe that would still be the

1886.88 --> 1891.3200000000002
same

1887.72 --> 1894.58
because that's how sight works

1891.32 --> 1894.58
you can't see forever

1898.7 --> 1905.419
which brings of course

1901.64 --> 1907.8200000000002
another interesting issue with the

1905.419 --> 1909.5590000000002
assumptions of heliocentrism and that is

1907.82 --> 1911.6589999999999
like oh okay so if you have a line of

1909.559 --> 1913.34
sight limit

1911.659 --> 1916.279
after which you can't resolve anything

1913.34 --> 1918.399
then how in God's name is are all these

1916.279 --> 1921.5
supposed giant Sons

1918.399 --> 1923.4189999999999
astronomical distances away

1921.5 --> 1926.0
how is all that light reaching over here

1923.419 --> 1927.98
why can you see anything

1926.0 --> 1931.76
and then the claim is because it's so

1927.98 --> 1934.22
big and then everything just becomes

1931.76 --> 1936.14
ridiculous

1934.22 --> 1938.779
you end up with mathematical

1936.14 --> 1943.0590000000002
postulations how all the light must be

1938.779 --> 1943.059
like perfectly parallel like laser

1943.22 --> 1948.679
and including the Sun

1945.5 --> 1950.779
yet that perfect parallel light Ray

1948.679 --> 1954.38
coming from the Sun all the way

1950.779 --> 1957.44
to earth when it hits the moon straight

1954.38 --> 1959.179
on then suddenly it diverges into

1957.44 --> 1962.6200000000001
umbramp penumbra like try to explain

1959.179 --> 1962.6200000000001
that yeah you can't

1967.88 --> 1973.8400000000001
but yeah you just can it makes

1970.7 --> 1973.8400000000001
absolutely no sense

1982.399 --> 1987.26
why can't I see her yeah because you

1984.919 --> 1989.179
have a limited side Thomas lesson you

1987.26 --> 1991.399
have a limited site at some point your

1989.179 --> 1994.48
eyes can't resolve things anymore the

1991.399 --> 1994.4799999999998
same goes for cameras

1996.86 --> 2000.34
at some point there's going to be so

1998.48 --> 2002.799
much preponderance of area looking

2000.34 --> 2005.559
through that what like even if you could

2002.799 --> 2007.4189999999999
zoom in even if you had the resolution

2005.559 --> 2010.72
for that

2007.419 --> 2013.0
you just see the Blurred up soup

2010.72 --> 2016.0
because the diffusion

2013.0 --> 2018.58
because of refraction just becomes too

2016.0 --> 2021.419
much to find any coherent

2018.58 --> 2021.4189999999999
coherence

2022.059 --> 2028.0
that's the limit to the side right if

2025.36 --> 2030.1589999999999
there was like a mountain beyond that

2028.0 --> 2034.019
point

2030.159 --> 2034.019
it would just not be visible

2034.48 --> 2040.96
even if it was huge

2037.659 --> 2043.419
because everything just blurs it up it's

2040.96 --> 2045.96
like there's a layer of water laying

2043.419 --> 2045.96
over it

2047.799 --> 2053.56
vertically like a sheet of water that's

2050.98 --> 2055.419
just blocking it

2053.56 --> 2058.7799999999997
right when something is directly

2055.419 --> 2060.7599999999998
underneath water like there's a rock

2058.78 --> 2063.0400000000004
under the ocean and it's kind of still

2060.76 --> 2065.26
the ocean and you look from the side

2063.04 --> 2066.82
you're gonna see the reflection of the

2065.26 --> 2069.8390000000004
sky right you're not you're just not

2066.82 --> 2069.839
gonna see that rock

2070.179 --> 2075.2200000000003
that that's a rough comparison to kind

2073.0 --> 2077.74
of like how I see the line of sight

2075.22 --> 2079.1189999999997
limit it's like it just becomes a

2077.74 --> 2081.7599999999998
blurred up soup

2079.119 --> 2084.4190000000003
like a sheet that covers everything

2081.76 --> 2084.4190000000003
behind it

2089.919 --> 2094.7799999999997
should I be able to see England with

2091.96 --> 2097.839
high power telescope maybe under the

2094.78 --> 2102.0
right weather conditions yeah yeah you

2097.839 --> 2102.0
should Thomas lesson actually

2105.339 --> 2111.04
if nothing is physically obstructing you

2107.82 --> 2114.82
like a mountain range or something

2111.04 --> 2117.96
yeah you should see very far if the

2114.82 --> 2117.96
weather conditions are right

2119.8 --> 2123.94
but yeah seeing as that would

2122.14 --> 2126.8199999999997
automatically mean you'd have to look

2123.94 --> 2129.4
over the ocean well then the moist

2126.82 --> 2132.52
levels are bound to be pretty high and

2129.4 --> 2135.6600000000003
that is typically a contributor to a the

2132.52 --> 2135.66
line of sight limitation

2137.14 --> 2140.8199999999997
because it causes refraction

2153.76 --> 2160.5400000000004
well France has been seen

2158.44 --> 2163.66
from the coast of England

2160.54 --> 2167.339
so I don't know why that observation

2163.66 --> 2167.339
hasn't been made from the other side

2169.3 --> 2175.5
or maybe they just didn't report on it

2172.72 --> 2175.5
I don't know

2191.32 --> 2194.26
yes sunlight and daylight are very

2193.3 --> 2196.599
different

2194.26 --> 2198.3390000000004
unfortunately in my explanations I

2196.599 --> 2200.44
sometimes have the tendency to kind of

2198.339 --> 2202.54
mix them up this is really annoying

2200.44 --> 2205.68
because it confuses the technicals but

2202.54 --> 2205.68
yes they're very different

2215.44 --> 2220.619
yeah Thomas Lawson don't nobody cares

2230.14 --> 2236.64
it's nothing to do with it

2233.56 --> 2240.2799999999997
it's completely stupid

2236.64 --> 2243.16
refraction across a flat surface is not

2240.28 --> 2246.3390000000004
as great as on a curved surface that

2243.16 --> 2249.5789999999997
makes no freaking sense

2246.339 --> 2252.46
any shape

2249.579 --> 2256.48
a solid uh

2252.46 --> 2259.48
opaque shape is not going to influence

2256.48 --> 2262.18
refraction you dummy has nothing to do

2259.48 --> 2264.579
with it the refraction only relates to

2262.18 --> 2267.8199999999997
the transparent Medium you're looking

2264.579 --> 2269.98
through any shape has no relation it's

2267.82 --> 2272.8590000000004
ridiculous

2269.98 --> 2277.38
you don't seem to have a good grip on

2272.859 --> 2277.38
Optics Thomas Lassen

2278.859 --> 2282.48
this is kind of stupid

2305.38 --> 2310.48
you're caring about the wrong thing you

2308.2 --> 2313.18
don't understand Optics refraction has

2310.48 --> 2315.64
nothing to do with looking past an

2313.18 --> 2317.7999999999997
opaque object

2315.64 --> 2320.3799999999997
I think you're mixing it up with

2317.8 --> 2323.8
diffraction right when you look past

2320.38 --> 2325.48
surfaces there's other effects we know

2323.8 --> 2328.8
them as diffraction

2325.48 --> 2331.66
right that's the apparent obstruction

2328.8 --> 2334.0
consume an effect in reality

2331.66 --> 2335.2599999999998
where you look where the bottom of

2334.0 --> 2338.619
things

2335.26 --> 2340.0600000000004
in relation to that surface become

2338.619 --> 2341.98
concealed

2340.06 --> 2344.7999999999997
that's because of diffraction that

2341.98 --> 2346.96
relates to opaque objects right that's

2344.8 --> 2350.26
not the same thing as the line of sight

2346.96 --> 2352.78
limiter which is refraction which only

2350.26 --> 2355.2400000000002
relates to the transparent Medium you're

2352.78 --> 2357.42
looking through

2355.24 --> 2357.4199999999996
foreign

2360.82 --> 2364.6600000000003
yeah no [ __ ]

2362.8 --> 2367.0600000000004
so Thomas lesson

2364.66 --> 2369.359
now relate that statement to your

2367.06 --> 2369.359
question

2380.5 --> 2384.94
yeah so the density gradient the medium

2383.38 --> 2386.8
light drill yeah yeah I know I've been

2384.94 --> 2389.38
saying that like three times since that

2386.8 --> 2390.82
question that was kind of silly

2389.38 --> 2393.6400000000003
so

2390.82 --> 2396.76
how does that statement which is correct

2393.64 --> 2399.5789999999997
how does that fit into

2396.76 --> 2401.26
why can't I see England from the west

2399.579 --> 2403.42
coast of Denmark

2401.26 --> 2405.96
oh wait no that's the wrong goddament

2403.42 --> 2405.96
black ring

2407.2 --> 2410.2799999999997
question damn it

2417.7 --> 2422.4399999999996
right how does that remain relate to the

2420.46 --> 2424.7200000000003
statement not a question refraction

2422.44 --> 2428.2000000000003
across a flat surface is not as great as

2424.72 --> 2431.2
on a curved surface how does that relate

2428.2 --> 2433.5989999999997
to refraction relates

2431.2 --> 2436.5989999999997
the density gradient of a medium light

2433.599 --> 2439.96
is traveling through how does the how do

2436.599 --> 2441.6400000000003
the one statement fit in this true

2439.96 --> 2445.619
statement how does that fit Thomas

2441.64 --> 2445.6189999999997
Lassen have you thought about it

2449.06 --> 2452.29
[Music]

2459.339 --> 2466.48
right so do you understand now that the

2462.4 --> 2469.44
original statements was ridiculous

2466.48 --> 2469.44
fallacious

2480.16 --> 2484.0
I mean if you do then I'm just gonna

2482.14 --> 2486.22
stop talking about that because that

2484.0 --> 2488.44
would be actually good

2486.22 --> 2490.9199999999996
it means that you're figuring it out

2488.44 --> 2490.92
that's good

2495.46 --> 2498.94
kind of lacking a piece of paper and a

2498.099 --> 2501.6600000000003
pen

2498.94 --> 2501.66
okay

2502.119 --> 2508.7200000000003
well look I can just show you my Optical

2506.02 --> 2511.24
slant model the information that we

2508.72 --> 2515.9399999999996
discussed is contained in there that's

2511.24 --> 2515.9399999999996
why I drew it like four years ago

2525.46 --> 2529.92
damn it

2526.96 --> 2529.92
it's not the one either

2533.44 --> 2535.98
right

2536.57 --> 2539.809
[Music]

2548.5 --> 2552.78
yeah because I had issue I myself had

2551.44 --> 2556.0
issues

2552.78 --> 2557.7400000000002
accidentally exchanging diffraction and

2556.0 --> 2559.96
refraction and that's been like a

2557.74 --> 2561.9399999999996
problem ever since that I accidentally

2559.96 --> 2564.579
messed it up but now I'm just gonna keep

2561.94 --> 2567.819
it straight diffraction

2564.579 --> 2573.2200000000003
only relates to what happens when light

2567.819 --> 2576.04
travels past a opaque solid surface

2573.22 --> 2578.3799999999997
and refraction really only relates to

2576.04 --> 2581.02
the actual transparent medium the light

2578.38 --> 2583.1800000000003
has to travel through that you see

2581.02 --> 2585.28
and that's how I now try to keep it

2583.18 --> 2588.5989999999997
apart to not mix them up because it's

2585.28 --> 2588.599
really annoying when that happens

2600.839 --> 2605.16
Optical sled Where Art Thou

2606.04 --> 2613.319
all right there you go

2608.92 --> 2613.319
all right so here's the optical slant

2614.8 --> 2618.9
on the left is the Observer

2619.18 --> 2623.68
the first zone is really where

2621.76 --> 2625.3590000000004
perspective matters the most because

2623.68 --> 2627.2799999999997
it's just the most

2625.359 --> 2629.92
obvious

2627.28 --> 2632.1400000000003
at some point the diffraction starts to

2629.92 --> 2633.819
kick in because yeah you're if you look

2632.14 --> 2636.339
out to the Horizon on Earth you're

2633.819 --> 2637.9
looking at a flat surface and yeah when

2636.339 --> 2640.2999999999997
you look past the flat surface

2637.9 --> 2644.56
diffraction sets in

2640.3 --> 2646.96
so apparent concealment starts

2644.56 --> 2649.2999999999997
at a linear rate

2646.96 --> 2651.94
and then at some point you don't see

2649.3 --> 2656.1400000000003
anything anymore it just blurs up

2651.94 --> 2658.54
in a giant uniform colored soup

2656.14 --> 2660.64
which I call the end of sight and that

2658.54 --> 2663.04
is caused by refraction

2660.64 --> 2665.6189999999997
and in between where the optical slant

2663.04 --> 2668.319
starts and the end of the line of sight

2665.619 --> 2673.319
I declared the miraging Zone because

2668.319 --> 2673.319
that's where like wonky things happen

2674.44 --> 2678.2200000000003
that's where the apparent

2676.599 --> 2680.56
obstruction which is actually

2678.22 --> 2682.359
concealment happens

2680.56 --> 2685.24
and

2682.359 --> 2689.0789999999997
yeah where eventually like you get like

2685.24 --> 2691.24
the Bendy cranes on the oil rigs right

2689.079 --> 2692.8
where it just starts wobbling all over

2691.24 --> 2695.319
the place visually

2692.8 --> 2698.2000000000003
that happens in The Mirage Zone and that

2695.319 --> 2700.0
starts after the diffraction induced

2698.2 --> 2703.48
Optical slant point

2700.0 --> 2705.579
in sight wherever that might be

2703.48 --> 2708.4
because the optical slant Point does

2705.579 --> 2710.38
migrate depending on your observation

2708.4 --> 2712.9
height if you go up the diffractions

2710.38 --> 2715.42
optical slant Point moves further into

2712.9 --> 2718.54
the distance when you go lower to the

2715.42 --> 2722.819
ground it moves Closer by

2718.54 --> 2722.819
it's a natural optic basis of effect

2723.88 --> 2726.359
right

2728.619 --> 2732.2400000000002
I hope that clears things up

2739.359 --> 2744.5789999999997
my statement yeah it is Thomas Lassen it

2742.3 --> 2746.2000000000003
is you were wrong

2744.579 --> 2749.38
yeah

2746.2 --> 2750.9399999999996
refraction line of sight limitation has

2749.38 --> 2754.119
nothing to do

2750.94 --> 2757.42
with an opaque surface you're looking

2754.119 --> 2759.599
past has nothing to do with that do you

2757.42 --> 2759.599
understand

2789.22 --> 2792.0
hello Cleary

2793.48 --> 2796.319
ah

2805.3 --> 2809.52
yeah I think I'm feeling better a bit

2813.819 --> 2818.099
good to dig into some technicals

2845.02 --> 2851.319
a foreign oh no it's yeah it's this it's

2848.44 --> 2853.54
kind of a baller guy

2851.319 --> 2856.3
I don't I don't think he's even like an

2853.54 --> 2859.02
anti-flatter it just seems more like a a

2856.3 --> 2859.02
baller

2863.26 --> 2866.579
I think he's pretty young

2867.819 --> 2872.4
he can correct me on that if he'd like

2869.859 --> 2872.4
but

2872.619 --> 2877.5
hey hello Rob h

2874.78 --> 2877.5
uh let's see you

2915.64 --> 2917.819
foreign

2951.819 --> 2954.7799999999997
hmm

2964.14 --> 2970.2
okay I guess that shut him up

2967.72 --> 2970.2
right

2992.68 --> 2997.4199999999996
I really like that little plane flying

2995.079 --> 3000.559
in there it's hilarious

2997.42 --> 3000.559
like in the background

3001.859 --> 3006.839
although it's kind of weird because this

3004.559 --> 3010.7400000000002
is not like a standardized pre-recorded

3006.839 --> 3012.839
animation I think the plane also flies

3010.74 --> 3015.359
there in the middle of night like

3012.839 --> 3017.88
without even any lights on

3015.359 --> 3020.94
like doing the same maneuver and that's

3017.88 --> 3023.119
kind of weird when that happens uh that

3020.94 --> 3025.7400000000002
seems super Reckless

3023.119 --> 3028.26
it's flying low in the middle of the

3025.74 --> 3031.319
night without lights on in the middle of

3028.26 --> 3033.8
a mountainous for it forested area

3031.319 --> 3033.8
okay

3034.14 --> 3038.339
whatever

3036.059 --> 3042.9
oh my sketch made very little sense too

3038.339 --> 3045.24
I'm sorry I'm very sorry

3042.9 --> 3047.099
that I wasn't able to get through to you

3045.24 --> 3051.54
Thomas Lassen

3047.099 --> 3054.2000000000003
but yeah the sketch has been tested

3051.54 --> 3054.2
a lot

3057.059 --> 3060.48
right

3058.619 --> 3063.96
and it is

3060.48 --> 3067.2
not an orthographic view thing

3063.96 --> 3069.66
you understand it's an impression it is

3067.2 --> 3072.96
descriptive

3069.66 --> 3075.96
to the experience like of the actual

3072.96 --> 3078.599
Observer to like how they would

3075.96 --> 3082.619
typically experience it in an apparent

3078.599 --> 3086.1600000000003
geometric way apparent not actual that's

3082.619 --> 3089.6400000000003
why it's even called the optical slant

3086.16 --> 3093.0589999999997
to emphasize there is no exponential

3089.64 --> 3095.22
drop in the in the concealment it's

3093.059 --> 3099.1800000000003
actually linear

3095.22 --> 3101.819
in its apparent drop rate that was

3099.18 --> 3105.0
before we even figured out that the that

3101.819 --> 3107.4
the Horizon isn't even geometric right I

3105.0 --> 3109.619
I figured this out really early when

3107.4 --> 3111.9
people were still like going back and

3109.619 --> 3115.5
forth whether how much something was

3111.9 --> 3118.44
hidden in some picture proved anything

3115.5 --> 3120.839
I looked at it I studied it on a like a

3118.44 --> 3123.059
visceral way

3120.839 --> 3124.92
and then I figured out like this is an

3123.059 --> 3126.78
optical slant that's what I'm looking at

3124.92 --> 3129.1800000000003
that's what

3126.78 --> 3132.3
my brain

3129.18 --> 3134.8799999999997
is interpreting it as

3132.3 --> 3138.3590000000004
right besides whatever is said of it

3134.88 --> 3141.3
like a purely internal observation

3138.359 --> 3144.7799999999997
and then I made the diagram to describe

3141.3 --> 3146.52
that experience of what you're seeing

3144.78 --> 3148.92
and then

3146.52 --> 3152.3
figure out like why

3148.92 --> 3152.3
why do you see that

3158.78 --> 3163.8
dude stop whining

3161.46 --> 3166.92
it works

3163.8 --> 3169.8590000000004
It's very effective if you don't like it

3166.92 --> 3171.359
well screw you I'm sorry I can't help

3169.859 --> 3172.92
you any further

3171.359 --> 3176.42
if you don't want to understand it

3172.92 --> 3176.42
that's your freaking issue

3178.44 --> 3183.78
yeah seeing France from England

3180.18 --> 3186.68
absolutely is very explainable within

3183.78 --> 3192.1800000000003
its model you can explain any

3186.68 --> 3194.64
observation any observation ever

3192.18 --> 3196.319
except maybe for like deep Celestial

3194.64 --> 3198.0
observations like it doesn't really

3196.319 --> 3200.46
apply to stars but then again Stars

3198.0 --> 3202.02
aren't really objects right and this is

3200.46 --> 3204.54
about objects

3202.02 --> 3207.8
it's about how do

3204.54 --> 3214.14
the Optics work in relation to objects

3207.8 --> 3214.1400000000003
including the Earth as a opaque object

3214.74 --> 3220.0789999999997
right not holographics

3218.28 --> 3222.599
my model doesn't explain the

3220.079 --> 3224.88
holographics of the celestial lights and

3222.599 --> 3228.059
that's about it everything else yeah you

3224.88 --> 3229.98
can absolutely explain it with that

3228.059 --> 3231.6800000000003
exactly with that

3229.98 --> 3233.7
right

3231.68 --> 3236.7599999999998
including like

3233.7 --> 3238.5
Professor Picard's siding

3236.76 --> 3243.48
from that balloon

3238.5 --> 3244.8
everything you can model every photo of

3243.48 --> 3248.28
Earth

3244.8 --> 3251.1600000000003
with my Optical slant model and and show

3248.28 --> 3253.559
like in a picture this is where the

3251.16 --> 3255.2999999999997
optical slant starts this is where the

3253.559 --> 3257.099
miraging zone and that's where you no

3255.3 --> 3260.2200000000003
longer see anything

3257.099 --> 3263.1600000000003
because of the blur up effect because of

3260.22 --> 3266.7
refraction the limit of sight yeah every

3263.16 --> 3269.96
freaking photo in the world about Earth

3266.7 --> 3273.66
right not the stars or whatever Earth

3269.96 --> 3276.839
every photo you can lay my diagram right

3273.66 --> 3279.96
next to it and then figuring out where

3276.839 --> 3284.099
in the photo are these points

3279.96 --> 3287.48
yeah you can absolutely you can I'm

3284.099 --> 3287.48
sorry if you can't see it

3299.88 --> 3304.559
yeah dude

3301.74 --> 3307.14
I think that the Clary was correct

3304.559 --> 3308.579
earlier when he says Thomas is physics

3307.14 --> 3310.2
challenged

3308.579 --> 3312.48
because that last statement you made

3310.2 --> 3314.04
there Thomas just proved straight out

3312.48 --> 3315.839
you have no idea what the hell you're

3314.04 --> 3318.299
talking about

3315.839 --> 3321.18
you ignored critical integral

3318.299 --> 3322.92
information that accompanies Optics and

3321.18 --> 3324.54
understanding Optics in that statement

3322.92 --> 3327.319
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

3324.54 --> 3327.319
talking about Thomas

3330.24 --> 3336.319
yeah we have a special boy in Chad

3332.52 --> 3336.319
Michael Khan hello by the way

3355.799 --> 3362.88
on a flat Earth proceeding with really

3359.52 --> 3366.66
dumb straw Manning fallacies about the

3362.88 --> 3370.579
Flat Earth model just like

3366.66 --> 3373.859
basically the globe model but then flat

3370.579 --> 3375.96
including all the exclusions of real

3373.859 --> 3378.66
effects right

3375.96 --> 3380.16
the globe model is like a stripped

3378.66 --> 3383.7599999999998
skeleton

3380.16 --> 3385.68
a resemblance of a working model

3383.76 --> 3387.7200000000003
and they're used to that so then they

3385.68 --> 3390.18
say oh on your

3387.72 --> 3392.5789999999997
Flat Earth

3390.18 --> 3394.859
and then they proceed to take a flatter

3392.579 --> 3397.02
disc and then apply all the same

3394.859 --> 3398.88
fallacies that they use to construct

3397.02 --> 3401.64
that skeletal structure of the globe

3398.88 --> 3403.859
model that barely works then they apply

3401.64 --> 3405.9
it to the Flat Earth model and then

3403.859 --> 3407.94
yellow doesn't make any sense yeah no

3405.9 --> 3410.7000000000003
[ __ ] because you're applying all your

3407.94 --> 3413.64
stupid Globe machinations to it what do

3410.7 --> 3416.8799999999997
you think is going to happen idiot

3413.64 --> 3419.339
the machinations is the problem not the

3416.88 --> 3423.02
freaking presupposition you just got

3419.339 --> 3423.02
your mechanics all scrambled up

3450.9 --> 3455.54
it is is it drizzling

3455.76 --> 3461.2200000000003
oh you got like the

3458.52 --> 3464.339
the curtain of tiny droplet type of rain

3461.22 --> 3466.68
I had that two days ago here

3464.339 --> 3470.339
where it's like it you don't see the

3466.68 --> 3472.319
rain like at all it's not really misty

3470.339 --> 3474.299
but as you're walking outside it's like

3472.319 --> 3476.88
you're getting this little this weird

3474.299 --> 3479.16
trickle rain you feel it but you can't

3476.88 --> 3481.7000000000003
see it it's too small that's really

3479.16 --> 3481.7
weird weather

3483.18 --> 3487.6189999999997
because it wasn't Misty but you didn't

3485.7 --> 3489.7799999999997
see the rain but you could still feel it

3487.619 --> 3492.7400000000002
like these micro droplets

3489.78 --> 3492.7400000000002
so odd

3496.98 --> 3501.079
anyway I'm gonna take a two minute break

3503.64 --> 3506.5989999999997
I'll be right back

3570.24 --> 3572.4799999999996
foreign

3588.0 --> 3590.119
okay

3610.14 --> 3612.319
thank you

3615.24 --> 3619.5789999999997
anyone keeping up with Jake no

3622.319 --> 3628.64
I'm not gonna lost interest in that guy

3625.14 --> 3628.64
like a couple of years ago

3653.28 --> 3657.599
right yeah

3655.319 --> 3661.02
PG crew Shank

3657.599 --> 3663.78
Michael Khan I don't think that

3661.02 --> 3666.48
like Brandon

3663.78 --> 3669.599
is coming back anytime soon because yeah

3666.48 --> 3670.859
the just his entire schedule rearranged

3669.599 --> 3673.02
and

3670.859 --> 3674.819
like he's not suddenly gonna do his

3673.02 --> 3676.2
stream right in the middle of his job

3674.819 --> 3678.599
right

3676.2 --> 3680.52
so I don't he's probably not coming back

3678.599 --> 3683.839
until like a seasonal change or his

3680.52 --> 3683.839
contract ends or something

3685.26 --> 3690.1800000000003
and besides suddenly switching jobs like

3688.38 --> 3692.1600000000003
that usually takes some time to

3690.18 --> 3695.7799999999997
acclimate

3692.16 --> 3695.7799999999997
to get used to it for him

3696.299 --> 3703.339
so I wouldn't be expecting to see him

3698.94 --> 3703.339
come back on YouTube anytime soon

3708.359 --> 3715.02
do you understand there is dude Thomas

3711.42 --> 3717.539
Lassen drop it you lost the argument you

3715.02 --> 3720.44
have no comprehension of Optics

3717.539 --> 3720.44
whatsoever

3720.539 --> 3724.1400000000003
whatsoever

3722.28 --> 3725.8190000000004
you don't understand what you're talking

3724.14 --> 3727.799
about

3725.819 --> 3732.48
you think you found some stupid little

3727.799 --> 3735.119
dilemma but your entire premise for that

3732.48 --> 3738.559
suggestion is false because you have no

3735.119 --> 3738.559
freaking idea what you're talking about

3739.14 --> 3744.48
stop yapping and figure out what you got

3742.98 --> 3746.28
wrong

3744.48 --> 3748.14
your premise is wrong you don't

3746.28 --> 3749.8190000000004
understand Optics you have no idea what

3748.14 --> 3753.02
you're talking about you might want to

3749.819 --> 3753.02
stop whining about it

3755.16 --> 3758.5989999999997
it's getting annoying

3761.339 --> 3764.339
foreign

3767.64 --> 3771.48
no

3769.559 --> 3774.2400000000002
I mean if he doesn't shut up about this

3771.48 --> 3776.88
[ __ ] or starts correcting himself but

3774.24 --> 3778.9799999999996
probably was not gonna do that but yeah

3776.88 --> 3780.9
you have no grounds

3778.98 --> 3782.76
you have no argument yeah you are

3780.9 --> 3788.52
whining

3782.76 --> 3788.5200000000004
no not oh okay [ __ ] off then [ __ ]

3790.02 --> 3794.4
yeah that's how you get booted from

3791.94 --> 3798.44
class yeah if you don't listen to the

3794.4 --> 3801.9
teacher who's actually spent his time

3798.44 --> 3806.099
entertaining your fallacies to help you

3801.9 --> 3808.44
correct them and then you defy that [ __ ]

3806.099 --> 3812.7000000000003
and you reassert your stupid little

3808.44 --> 3814.619
fallacy well [ __ ] off then [ __ ]

3812.7 --> 3816.66
I don't have time to waste on that [ __ ]

3814.619 --> 3818.099
I mean it was interesting trying to

3816.66 --> 3820.319
inform you

3818.099 --> 3823.2000000000003
but I'm not gonna play some repetition

3820.319 --> 3826.14
game because you're just too stupid to

3823.2 --> 3827.46
let proper information sink in

3826.14 --> 3829.859
all right

3827.46 --> 3835.02
so [ __ ] off

3829.859 --> 3835.02
with your stupid anarchy symbol [ __ ]

3838.74 --> 3842.4199999999996
yeah you did call it Michael Khan

3843.42 --> 3846.14
all right

3861.18 --> 3869.7
yeah that's correct your Sanford it is

3865.619 --> 3871.98
where the most water vapor is mixed in

3869.7 --> 3873.839
with the air which is right above water

3871.98 --> 3875.52
bodies

3873.839 --> 3878.2799999999997
it always is

3875.52 --> 3880.14
yeah there the refraction becomes

3878.28 --> 3883.619
enhanced

3880.14 --> 3886.0989999999997
like that part of the medium has more

3883.619 --> 3886.099
refraction

3894.9 --> 3899.2200000000003
what do you think of my symbol what you

3898.079 --> 3901.1400000000003
mean

3899.22 --> 3902.5789999999997
a black circle

3901.14 --> 3904.68
with

3902.579 --> 3907.46
something in the corner that I can

3904.68 --> 3907.46
barely make out

3913.559 --> 3918.98
oh

3914.88 --> 3918.98
it's a red beaked

3919.079 --> 3923.3390000000004
black kiwi

3921.42 --> 3926.599
looks creepy

3923.339 --> 3926.599
it is a kiwi right

3931.859 --> 3938.0
in Ibis I don't know what that is it

3934.319 --> 3938.0
looks like a kiwi bird to me

3943.02 --> 3946.02
foreign

3973.799 --> 3977.0
what is an Ibis

3980.88 --> 3986.2400000000002
are you gonna tell me or are you gonna

3982.619 --> 3986.2400000000002
force me to Google that [ __ ]

3997.16 --> 4003.0989999999997
[Applause]

3999.0 --> 4003.099
oh what the

4008.539 --> 4012.7400000000002
weird

4010.52 --> 4014.859
is that like the stock family or

4012.74 --> 4014.859
something

4016.099 --> 4020.539
right

4018.319 --> 4022.52
oh if you shrink that down significantly

4020.539 --> 4023.539
it does kind of start to look like a

4022.52 --> 4026.02
kiwi

4023.539 --> 4026.0200000000004
so

4026.42 --> 4032.48
yeah of course it's a bird I already saw

4029.599 --> 4035.319
but yeah it's yours very shady I thought

4032.48 --> 4035.319
it was a kiwi

4044.59 --> 4047.6890000000003
[Applause]

4055.22 --> 4058.839
keepers are so freaking cute

4070.039 --> 4072.7000000000003
huh

4078.619 --> 4080.619
um

4085.099 --> 4088.099
okay

4108.14 --> 4113.14
I wonder what the name of an Ibis bird

4110.359 --> 4113.14
is in Dutch

4115.159 --> 4119.419
foreign

4116.069 --> 4119.419000000001
[Applause]

4120.02 --> 4125.540000000001
that's not helpful

4122.359 --> 4128.08
oh it's the same an Ibis

4125.54 --> 4128.08
all right

4155.54 --> 4160.239
dude are you freaking chanting in my

4157.94 --> 4160.239
chat

4162.199 --> 4168.199
are you trying to invoke some kind of

4164.42 --> 4168.1990000000005
Egyptian stuff

4172.9 --> 4179.5599999999995
LOL nose so what did Toth and Hermes

4176.359 --> 4179.56
have to freaking do with it

4202.04 --> 4204.88
foreign

4245.6 --> 4249.860000000001
and now you're retracting it

4248.36 --> 4253.28
uh

4249.86 --> 4256.4
you know that's just on record right

4253.28 --> 4259.42
at least it should be my chat can damn

4256.4 --> 4259.42
keep up

4261.26 --> 4268.360000000001
I'm gonna try to fix this this is

4265.04 --> 4268.36
really annoying

4274.04 --> 4279.14
no the chat

4276.98 --> 4282.759999999999
duh

4279.14 --> 4282.76
oh wait that's why

4286.94 --> 4293.379999999999
I'm gonna

4288.92 --> 4293.38
oh my God how does that happen

4315.92 --> 4318.6990000000005
ah

4320.659 --> 4325.599999999999
Ah that's the one stupid thing

4358.34 --> 4365.8
all right no more freaking concealment

4362.48 --> 4365.799999999999
done with that [ __ ]

4367.64 --> 4371.08
it's gonna be visible

4418.58 --> 4420.76
foreign

4446.54 --> 4451.06
okay let's pick this up further

4455.78 --> 4462.759999999999
well that didn't work out no not that

4464.239 --> 4467.239
dude

4473.659 --> 4477.46
great now it's bigger whatever

4499.4 --> 4507.28
yeah that's the way I want it

4502.3 --> 4507.28
should have done that a long time ago

4526.52 --> 4528.6990000000005
foreign

4543.159 --> 4550.339999999999
warns us of such like

4547.28 --> 4553.599999999999
such like what

4550.34 --> 4553.6
in the last days

4555.98 --> 4558.58
what

4559.94 --> 4567.5599999999995
oh referring to Toff

4563.84 --> 4569.659000000001
yeah that's why I I recognize that

4567.56 --> 4571.88
that's right

4569.659 --> 4574.299999999999
that's why I asked like did you just

4571.88 --> 4576.7390000000005
freaking invoke some Egyptian god

4574.3 --> 4579.1990000000005
Egyptian god

4576.739 --> 4582.259999999999
for some reason

4579.199 --> 4586.12
it's a little weirded out by that you

4582.26 --> 4586.12
did retract the message again but

4605.179 --> 4609.82
Toth means knowledge okay

4613.82 --> 4616.9
knowledge of what

4623.96 --> 4626.96
foreign

4654.14 --> 4659.320000000001
do I like geometry

4656.48 --> 4659.32
uh

4661.82 --> 4669.92
not particularly I mean

4666.08 --> 4672.46
I have good visual I have a good visual

4669.92 --> 4672.46
brain

4672.56 --> 4677.360000000001
but like the discipline within

4674.84 --> 4679.88
mathematics no

4677.36 --> 4681.5599999999995
I'm not an expert at that

4679.88 --> 4684.02
but I do

4681.56 --> 4686.42
tend to understand those types of things

4684.02 --> 4690.46
pretty quickly

4686.42 --> 4690.46
I'm just not like a math guy

4706.64 --> 4710.4800000000005
foreign

4708.14 --> 4712.900000000001
what

4710.48 --> 4712.9
why

4713.12 --> 4719.599999999999
why should I practice

4716.14 --> 4722.7390000000005
trigonometry on the Pyramid of Giza

4719.6 --> 4722.7390000000005
what's the point

4724.699 --> 4729.139999999999
I mean I know it's been built there in

4727.52 --> 4733.219
the very specific

4729.14 --> 4735.9800000000005
way with like the tunnels

4733.219 --> 4738.32
tiny tunnels going straight through it

4735.98 --> 4740.959999999999
that line up in a certain way with

4738.32 --> 4744.139999999999
certain Stars

4740.96 --> 4746.06
that's it I know about that that's kind

4744.14 --> 4749.679
of common knowledge by now

4746.06 --> 4749.679
since the 90s at least

4751.52 --> 4757.2390000000005
but that's about it don't know what it's

4753.8 --> 4757.2390000000005
supposed to be proving though

4757.52 --> 4762.52
you might be surprised what you like

4760.28 --> 4762.5199999999995
what

4798.44 --> 4806.0599999999995
that's like what what's the point what

4801.739 --> 4809.599999999999
oh go to the pyramid Giza and apply a

4806.06 --> 4813.5
geometric math thing to it

4809.6 --> 4816.5
for what what's the point

4813.5 --> 4818.98
it's math what do you think some you do

4816.5 --> 4821.48
that instantly something magical like

4818.98 --> 4824.78
hallucinatory happens to you like what

4821.48 --> 4827.86
the hell are you blabbering about weirdo

4824.78 --> 4827.86
this is getting weird

4839.06 --> 4842.06
foreign

4865.78 --> 4870.739
make it put it in chat or I'm gonna ban

4869.96 --> 4872.96
you

4870.739 --> 4875.659
I'm not gonna let you start some weird

4872.96 --> 4878.9
little mystery Religion tour here okay

4875.659 --> 4882.5
that's not what my show is for this is

4878.9 --> 4884.599999999999
for the revealing of information not to

4882.5 --> 4887.02
start your little mysticism routines

4884.6 --> 4887.02
okay

4892.639 --> 4897.86
so surprise us what are you gonna find

4894.92 --> 4900.679
when you apply trigonometry at the

4897.86 --> 4903.699
Giza Pyramids go

4900.679 --> 4903.6990000000005
do it now

4921.86 --> 4924.58
foreign

4929.56 --> 4934.84
just Banning you if you don't actually

4932.3 --> 4934.84
respond

4937.28 --> 4940.0599999999995
but anyway

4947.56 --> 4951.860000000001
yeah you've noticed things you don't

4950.12 --> 4954.139
like turn out to be evil yeah that's

4951.86 --> 4955.82
literally God inside of you

4954.139 --> 4959.6
using

4955.82 --> 4963.08
your system to warn you

4959.6 --> 4966.9400000000005
from within your more innocent

4963.08 --> 4966.94
viewing point of being

4971.78 --> 4979.34
I'll take the band okay bye bye

4976.219 --> 4982.4
see you later weirdo

4979.34 --> 4986.62
I'm not interested in your Egyptian

4982.4 --> 4986.62
themed parlor tricks okay

4987.38 --> 4990.159000000001
get a point

5002.02 --> 5009.040000000001
a stupid 666 [ __ ]

5005.38 --> 5012.34
like does anybody even realize everybody

5009.04 --> 5014.139
like that the freaking 666 is just a

5012.34 --> 5016.96
hijacked thing

5014.139 --> 5019.78
come on you gotta know that

5016.96 --> 5023.34
like oh that's the ultimate beast is it

5019.78 --> 5023.34
oh really who started that

5025.42 --> 5033.04
when did that first start to become a

5028.6 --> 5037.120000000001
thing that 666 is the Beast

5033.04 --> 5039.9
the Satan evil when did that start I bet

5037.12 --> 5039.9
it didn't start

5040.12 --> 5046.36
six thousand years ago

5043.54 --> 5048.5199999999995
I bet it started kind of right around

5046.36 --> 5050.139
the time

5048.52 --> 5053.4400000000005
when

5050.139 --> 5056.219
the Catholic Church started to make its

5053.44 --> 5056.219
move on the world

5057.34 --> 5060.43
[Music]

5060.52 --> 5067.4400000000005
yeah the Bible but did the Old Testament

5064.0 --> 5067.44
or did the New Testament

5068.679 --> 5074.26
I'm asking Maybe I'm Wrong maybe it is

5072.1 --> 5077.52
actually older than that

5074.26 --> 5077.52
but I don't think so

5088.48 --> 5094.36
and right and I think that it's like

5090.52 --> 5097.4800000000005
even in the common mind the 666 is just

5094.36 --> 5099.94
over mystified

5097.48 --> 5103.239
it's like oh it's so scary it's so scary

5099.94 --> 5105.28
for the numbers like really why is it

5103.239 --> 5109.739
666

5105.28 --> 5114.82
what what is that why would the Beast be

5109.739 --> 5116.86
prophesized to be taking 666.

5114.82 --> 5119.32
like it if it's going to be a

5116.86 --> 5122.92
self-fulfilling prophecy because the

5119.32 --> 5124.96
Bible says 666 they take 666. that just

5122.92 --> 5129.2390000000005
makes it really weird

5124.96 --> 5132.82
it really does unless there is another

5129.239 --> 5136.718999999999
significance to 666 that doesn't

5132.82 --> 5139.36
actually involve the Beast that precedes

5136.719 --> 5143.159
the Beast that is just like a part of

5139.36 --> 5143.159
the framework of how things work

5143.32 --> 5148.48
and that significance has kind of been

5145.96 --> 5151.4800000000005
lost

5148.48 --> 5152.739
and replaced with it's the Beast

5151.48 --> 5155.739
right

5152.739 --> 5158.32
That's what Satan does

5155.739 --> 5162.339999999999
takes a symbol

5158.32 --> 5165.94
anything an icon a number

5162.34 --> 5168.34
and then says this is me this was always

5165.94 --> 5171.599999999999
me and then everybody think oh my God a

5168.34 --> 5174.28
pentagram oh no that's of the devil

5171.6 --> 5177.280000000001
they go nuts

5174.28 --> 5180.159
even though it was basically just

5177.28 --> 5183.639
assimilated by people that just put it

5180.159 --> 5186.159
down versus our evil dominance

5183.639 --> 5188.38
they take something that exists

5186.159 --> 5192.339999999999
as a function has a history has

5188.38 --> 5194.26
implications and then basically put a

5192.34 --> 5195.6990000000005
giant turd on it and shove it in

5194.26 --> 5197.46
everybody's face and now everybody

5195.699 --> 5200.98
Associated

5197.46 --> 5203.139
deterred with the symbol

5200.98 --> 5207.94
right I'm not falling for that trick

5203.139 --> 5210.659000000001
anymore I'm taking it back all of it all

5207.94 --> 5210.659
of it

5211.42 --> 5213.6
foreign

5222.42 --> 5230.4
for real and not fall for the stupid

5225.82 --> 5230.4
spooky spooky scary Devil's [ __ ]

5230.8 --> 5235.42
because if you let that happen

5232.36 --> 5237.82
eventually everything will be marked

5235.42 --> 5239.86
everything will become about the devil

5237.82 --> 5241.179
everything will be a symbol for the

5239.86 --> 5242.58
devil everything everything everything

5241.179 --> 5246.42
everything everything

5242.58 --> 5249.88
until you are literally in your mind

5246.42 --> 5254.08
surrounded by hell because everything

5249.88 --> 5256.1990000000005
means the devil you see

5254.08 --> 5259.42
and first it like

5256.199 --> 5261.4
crouches up on you slowly

5259.42 --> 5263.32
and you accept it and first you don't

5261.4 --> 5264.759999999999
really notice but yeah there's gonna be

5263.32 --> 5268.199
a point where you're gonna actually

5264.76 --> 5268.1990000000005
start feeling that like

5268.3 --> 5273.28
why are people so scared of this when

5271.3 --> 5275.38
it's just somebody basically trying to

5273.28 --> 5277.84
Bluff their way through

5275.38 --> 5281.46
dominate through Bluff

5277.84 --> 5281.46
why are you falling for that

5285.4 --> 5291.5199999999995
Bible States it the number of a man okay

5288.34 --> 5295.0
right but right Michael Khan well there

5291.52 --> 5296.9800000000005
you go that's even typical like because

5295.0 --> 5299.679
a lot of Christians believe in things

5296.98 --> 5303.218999999999
that priests have told them that Jesus

5299.679 --> 5306.34
contradicts so it's kind of comely like

5303.219 --> 5309.4
oh 666 is the work of the devil that's

5306.34 --> 5310.659000000001
like a common thing even though you just

5309.4 --> 5313.0599999999995
said it's

5310.659 --> 5314.92
the number of a man so it isn't

5313.06 --> 5317.56
literally that but people still believe

5314.92 --> 5318.76
it because it it just leaked in there

5317.56 --> 5322.02
and now

5318.76 --> 5322.02
people think that

5324.28 --> 5326.82
right

5327.159 --> 5333.0
they don't think about what it really

5329.199 --> 5333.0
means in the depth of it

5333.88 --> 5339.82
they just think evil

5336.52 --> 5341.320000000001
personified oh it's a symbol of evil

5339.82 --> 5344.5
personified

5341.32 --> 5346.48
right that's what they do they don't get

5344.5 --> 5349.36
it

5346.48 --> 5353.94
they're just look yeah

5349.36 --> 5353.94
letting the boogeyman project onto them

5354.34 --> 5359.1990000000005
which is what the evil really did with

5356.44 --> 5362.5599999999995
it with a symbol that means much more

5359.199 --> 5363.759999999999
that isn't really for the Common Man a

5362.56 --> 5366.46
lot of the time because they don't have

5363.76 --> 5370.06
the mind to grasp it and then they just

5366.46 --> 5374.38
project evil over it and say oh oh look

5370.06 --> 5377.7390000000005
we're gonna dominate you be scared

5374.38 --> 5382.56
and then yeah people get scared and they

5377.739 --> 5382.5599999999995
start to like ah it's the devil

5389.56 --> 5395.280000000001
hello Lucinda

5391.54 --> 5395.28
probably a Roman Emperor

5397.659 --> 5400.839999999999
well yeah that

5399.46 --> 5403.42
that's what it's called the Roman

5400.84 --> 5406.96
Catholic Church isn't it the Romans did

5403.42 --> 5409.2390000000005
start it they they basically captured

5406.96 --> 5412.42
the legacy of Christ

5409.239 --> 5415.239
and then kind of became the opposite of

5412.42 --> 5419.8
it while wielding it officially it's

5415.239 --> 5421.839999999999
very satanic like really really that

5419.8 --> 5424.659000000001
reversed World trick you take something

5421.84 --> 5426.639
you become its arch enemy

5424.659 --> 5429.239
and then you convince the world that you

5426.639 --> 5432.04
are on its side well literally

5429.239 --> 5434.379999999999
undermining everything it stands for

5432.04 --> 5437.199
to a point where people don't even see

5434.38 --> 5441.219
that anymore that's what they did

5437.199 --> 5444.638999999999
they encapsulated Christ's Legacy and

5441.219 --> 5447.4
made a satanic control system around it

5444.639 --> 5449.8
and dominated the world with it through

5447.4 --> 5452.259999999999
theocracy and it doesn't mean that

5449.8 --> 5454.42
everybody would be in the know of that

5452.26 --> 5456.76
structural fact

5454.42 --> 5458.8
there will be many Christians even in

5456.76 --> 5460.84
the hierarchy that would be like we are

5458.8 --> 5462.1
here for Christ we are of Christ we've

5460.84 --> 5464.5
got to do good we've got to follow his

5462.1 --> 5466.360000000001
rule they would get it even though

5464.5 --> 5467.98
they're literally in that system that

5466.36 --> 5471.28
was kind of structurally designed to

5467.98 --> 5472.839999999999
encapsulate and counter Christ

5471.28 --> 5475.54
but yeah

5472.84 --> 5478.360000000001
the Beast the evil knows

5475.54 --> 5480.04
you've got to have some real reality in

5478.36 --> 5482.32
it you got to have people in there that

5480.04 --> 5484.179
really believe it because otherwise

5482.32 --> 5488.159
everybody's gonna see

5484.179 --> 5488.159
The Evil Within it

5488.5 --> 5495.3
you got to have good people in your evil

5490.9 --> 5495.299999999999
religion that don't realize it's evil

5497.98 --> 5504.58
or there would not be any gen

5501.12 --> 5506.5599999999995
what is it genuineness

5504.58 --> 5508.54
people will see that that they're just

5506.56 --> 5510.820000000001
like the priests have disdain for them

5508.54 --> 5512.38
if all the priests are in the known they

5510.82 --> 5514.48
will have disdain for them just like

5512.38 --> 5516.159000000001
start to get really like this feels like

5514.48 --> 5517.659
I'm just being manipulated they have no

5516.159 --> 5519.219
respect for us they don't really believe

5517.659 --> 5523.239
what they're preaching

5519.219 --> 5524.8
you gotta have real Believers Within

5523.239 --> 5527.32
the ranks

5524.8 --> 5530.219
or people are just not gonna buy it

5527.32 --> 5530.219
anymore at some point

5534.88 --> 5539.04
ah

5536.86 --> 5539.04
foreign

5541.36 --> 5546.5199999999995
so that's the bizarre

5543.94 --> 5550.98
in my opinion the bizarre reality of

5546.52 --> 5550.9800000000005
like how Christianity has manifested

5551.44 --> 5557.739
right it's kind of been

5554.679 --> 5560.86
partially rotten from the start but at

5557.739 --> 5562.299999999999
the same time it has grafted in a lot of

5560.86 --> 5564.88
good as well

5562.3 --> 5565.84
that made their own individual marks on

5564.88 --> 5569.4400000000005
it

5565.84 --> 5572.02
right so it's kind of like an ugly thing

5569.44 --> 5574.839999999999
that's more just about mind control but

5572.02 --> 5578.9800000000005
still has really good

5574.84 --> 5582.04
logos based info around it as well

5578.98 --> 5585.4
and you yeah when you can get into the

5582.04 --> 5587.62
religion it's like a god Choice like you

5585.4 --> 5590.159
can choose the good gems focus on that

5587.62 --> 5592.96
and focus on the teachings of Christ

5590.159 --> 5594.94
focusing on real peacemaking and like

5592.96 --> 5596.08
how do we avoid violence and dominance

5594.94 --> 5599.138999999999
and all that

5596.08 --> 5601.0
or you could be like Oh I'm gonna

5599.139 --> 5603.28
I'm gonna be a Grappler and I'm gonna

5601.0 --> 5605.679
like trick everybody with my authority

5603.28 --> 5607.36
to like do really disgusting things in

5605.679 --> 5608.62
the back rooms and all that [ __ ] right

5607.36 --> 5611.679
the

5608.62 --> 5614.38
options you get the choice are you going

5611.679 --> 5617.82
to be the evil part of this or are you

5614.38 --> 5617.82
going to be the good part of this

5618.4 --> 5622.48
it's really sophisticated when you think

5620.62 --> 5624.82
about it and that's why it has been

5622.48 --> 5627.099999999999
around for so long and has ruled it has

5624.82 --> 5629.94
it ruled Europe

5627.1 --> 5629.9400000000005
theocracy

5638.139 --> 5642.34
what are they teaching these kids these

5640.239 --> 5645.218999999999
days oh

5642.34 --> 5647.5
yeah well it's certainly

5645.219 --> 5650.44
the dark side seems to be like really

5647.5 --> 5652.48
getting pushy there top down in the

5650.44 --> 5653.62
Catholic church it's not surprising with

5652.48 --> 5657.94
this Pope

5653.62 --> 5657.94
who's just like yeah

5658.42 --> 5662.38
I don't need to

5660.88 --> 5666.400000000001
say anything about it like everybody

5662.38 --> 5668.5
knows that's just bad news this guy

5666.4 --> 5670.48
it's a Jesuit is technically not even

5668.5 --> 5673.6
supposed to be Pope

5670.48 --> 5677.339999999999
and he's just a weirdo and a communist

5673.6 --> 5680.02
and very anti-christian in many ways

5677.34 --> 5681.6990000000005
Pro gay and all that's disgusting

5680.02 --> 5685.139
idiotic

5681.699 --> 5685.138999999999
it's not what a pope should be doing

5685.42 --> 5687.9
anyway

5701.8 --> 5705.88
how could someone in the 21st century

5703.78 --> 5706.78
still not know the Earth is flat well if

5705.88 --> 5709.719
they've

5706.78 --> 5712.0
live a little longer Eugene

5709.719 --> 5714.28
they've been around like since the 60s

5712.0 --> 5716.94
then they still have all that

5714.28 --> 5716.94
programming

5718.0 --> 5722.739
for when it really wasn't all that

5720.46 --> 5725.56
obvious so only for those that are like

5722.739 --> 5727.718999999999
really in the want to figure it out with

5725.56 --> 5731.1990000000005
risk back then

5727.719 --> 5733.2390000000005
right they'll just realize like oh God

5731.199 --> 5734.5
what's happening out there world's gone

5733.239 --> 5736.78
crazy

5734.5 --> 5738.4
what is all this flat earthers and

5736.78 --> 5740.739
they'll just like no way I've seen

5738.4 --> 5743.379999999999
enough like hey I helped a guy build a

5740.739 --> 5745.419999999999
like I knew this guy that actually built

5743.38 --> 5746.9800000000005
a satellite and I've seen it and it let

5745.42 --> 5749.1990000000005
me in the workshop and showed the

5746.98 --> 5752.138999999999
satellite like that's real right and

5749.199 --> 5754.839999999999
they'll just hang on to those memories

5752.139 --> 5757.06
because that's their programming but

5754.84 --> 5760.360000000001
yeah the newer Generations

5757.06 --> 5764.139
the ones that are really like born after

5760.36 --> 5766.239
2000 roughly and maybe some others

5764.139 --> 5768.28
it all depends it's a life choice it's

5766.239 --> 5771.5199999999995
like do you want to understand or you

5768.28 --> 5774.159
just want to go along with the mash

5771.52 --> 5777.6990000000005
right but the younger Generations

5774.159 --> 5780.219
they will figure it out so yeah but the

5777.699 --> 5782.5
older Generations they are gonna just

5780.219 --> 5784.9
latch on to their old programming and

5782.5 --> 5788.38
just like no it's [ __ ] I've seen the

5784.9 --> 5791.0199999999995
proof even though it doesn't make sense

5788.38 --> 5794.52
I saw it on TV when it happened the moon

5791.02 --> 5794.52
landing right it has to be real

5796.179 --> 5798.78
so

5802.239 --> 5808.659
oh yeah yeah I am Rick Montgomery yeah

5805.96 --> 5810.88
I've openly declared that many times

5808.659 --> 5813.04
because it's true

5810.88 --> 5814.96
not that you know what that even means

5813.04 --> 5817.179
right you use it like it's some kind of

5814.96 --> 5820.659
an accusation

5817.179 --> 5824.92
I get physically ill from gay Behavior

5820.659 --> 5827.619
that's right I get physically ill

5824.92 --> 5830.08
from people seeing that like I have to

5827.619 --> 5832.96
psychologically defend myself when just

5830.08 --> 5835.9
a guy is acting a little gay and I pick

5832.96 --> 5839.08
up on that not that I spring into action

5835.9 --> 5841.42
and stop it I'm not a complete idiot

5839.08 --> 5844.54
but it literally causes me physical

5841.42 --> 5846.46
discomfort and I think that

5844.54 --> 5850.0
it's safe to say that that falls under

5846.46 --> 5852.04
homophobia yeah I am I am I am

5850.0 --> 5853.54
clinically homophobic Rick Montgomery

5852.04 --> 5857.26
and there's nothing I can do about it

5853.54 --> 5860.139
it's biologically ingrained into me you

5857.26 --> 5863.38
understand [ __ ]

5860.139 --> 5866.38
you want to get bad now [ __ ]

5863.38 --> 5868.3
are you a [ __ ] Rick Montgomery are you

5866.38 --> 5871.2390000000005
a fan a [ __ ]

5868.3 --> 5873.6990000000005
that you're protesting

5871.239 --> 5877.36
that you're protesting

5873.699 --> 5879.46
are you a [ __ ] Rick Montgomery

5877.36 --> 5882.4
because it's usually those right those

5879.46 --> 5884.86
that just accepted it

5882.4 --> 5887.92
to be normal

5884.86 --> 5889.54
have all this gay behavior in them that

5887.92 --> 5893.1990000000005
they're shocked that somebody could not

5889.54 --> 5895.54
accept it that usually means you're gay

5893.199 --> 5898.0599999999995
Rick Montgomery

5895.54 --> 5900.5199999999995
I am gay actually

5898.06 --> 5903.46
that's disgusting

5900.52 --> 5906.820000000001
you're banned yeah that's right I just

5903.46 --> 5909.4800000000005
banned the guy for being gay

5906.82 --> 5909.48
that's right

5909.699 --> 5914.678999999999
squirt for me [ __ ]

5911.56 --> 5917.52
I banned you because you were gay

5914.679 --> 5917.52
that's right

5918.46 --> 5924.88
because my biology demanded I do that

5922.84 --> 5927.52
I have no choice

5924.88 --> 5930.639
I would literally get sick

5927.52 --> 5932.9800000000005
if I allowed somebody in my chat

5930.639 --> 5935.139
who basically proudly

5932.98 --> 5938.58
announces he's gay

5935.139 --> 5938.58
because that's disgusting

5938.739 --> 5943.54
and it's not biblical

5941.619 --> 5945.9
I don't care what you think about it it

5943.54 --> 5945.9
isn't

5953.44 --> 5956.099999999999
ugh

5959.86 --> 5964.739
foreign

5961.9 --> 5967.839999999999
gays

5964.739 --> 5970.36
I ban gays

5967.84 --> 5972.82
keep your gay to yourself I don't want

5970.36 --> 5975.159
nobody you can't be gay you gotta keep

5972.82 --> 5979.48
it a secret in my presence because I get

5975.159 --> 5982.0599999999995
physically ill from knowing that

5979.48 --> 5983.919999999999
especially if you show Pride within it I

5982.06 --> 5986.679
get physically ill

5983.92 --> 5990.58
you understand it's a physical burden on

5986.679 --> 5993.6990000000005
me I could probably prove that

5990.58 --> 5998.639
maybe we've even proved that in court

5993.699 --> 5998.638999999999
right it's not something I made up

6010.26 --> 6018.54
the child Gods Eugene no no no

6015.84 --> 6024.5
every dude when that that movie came out

6018.54 --> 6024.5
everybody was whining about it and like

6027.26 --> 6030.8
so disgusting

6031.679 --> 6037.4400000000005
I'm very happy to report I have never

6034.56 --> 6040.26
seen that movie ever

6037.44 --> 6043.86
I've seen the trailer

6040.26 --> 6046.6990000000005
once and after that's like okay I'm not

6043.86 --> 6046.699
gonna watch that

6047.4 --> 6053.42
like there's no way anybody could ever

6049.98 --> 6053.419999999999
make me watch that thanks

6054.239 --> 6059.099999999999
why would anyone watch that movie

6056.159 --> 6061.4
because they're gay BJ Cru shank that's

6059.1 --> 6061.400000000001
why

6069.02 --> 6072.5
Brokeback Mountain

6098.28 --> 6101.0
what

6101.58 --> 6104.239
dude

6111.78 --> 6117.48
I didn't dude that's like a really

6114.84 --> 6119.28
confusing sentence there Eugene dude I

6117.48 --> 6121.619
almost thought you literally said that

6119.28 --> 6124.739
you did

6121.619 --> 6127.339999999999
which is insane

6124.739 --> 6127.339999999999
but

6128.04 --> 6133.699
why that's a very strange way to

6130.619 --> 6133.699
formulate a sentence

6134.699 --> 6139.379999999999
is this just me or is that really weird

6137.219 --> 6144.02
thing to say that

6139.38 --> 6144.02
I'm not gonna say it out loud thanks

6157.32 --> 6161.119
what what's going on here

6162.0 --> 6164.719
this is weird

6179.159 --> 6182.94
they like certain type of brain cells

6181.44 --> 6185.58
well I think

6182.94 --> 6187.799999999999
that the whole gay thing and that you're

6185.58 --> 6191.3
able to tolerate that is actually

6187.8 --> 6195.0
because you've first burned yourself out

6191.3 --> 6197.1
like there is Natural Instincts against

6195.0 --> 6201.06
it

6197.1 --> 6203.159000000001
but if that instinct then gets damaged

6201.06 --> 6205.26
because it's like been forced on them

6203.159 --> 6207.799999999999
it's very classical right that's

6205.26 --> 6207.8
official

6209.46 --> 6216.0
right rape rape tends to make people gay

6214.32 --> 6217.5
especially if it happened at a young age

6216.0 --> 6221.1
is weird

6217.5 --> 6222.659
but that happens or if they get like oh

6221.1 --> 6224.88
you're gay you're gay you're gay and

6222.659 --> 6227.46
then they like really go for it like

6224.88 --> 6231.42
it's some kind of a freaking mission

6227.46 --> 6233.4
and then they like burn out the sickness

6231.42 --> 6235.08
it might be possible for something I

6233.4 --> 6237.78
don't want to know I don't even want to

6235.08 --> 6239.76
think about that it's so disgusting but

6237.78 --> 6241.98
I think that's how it happens you have

6239.76 --> 6245.96
Natural Instincts against it

6241.98 --> 6245.959999999999
but you can basically choose

6246.6 --> 6252.42
to become gay and that's why I say it's

6248.699 --> 6254.82
a choice it's a choice nobody's born

6252.42 --> 6258.119
that way

6254.82 --> 6261.239
right you might get challenged

6258.119 --> 6263.239
and then be afflicted

6261.239 --> 6266.28
by

6263.239 --> 6267.718999999999
memories or the ideas or certain social

6266.28 --> 6268.8
attitudes

6267.719 --> 6271.32
Etc

6268.8 --> 6273.2390000000005
you don't get born with that if you

6271.32 --> 6275.78
don't if you're not traumatized

6273.239 --> 6275.78
whatsoever

6275.88 --> 6283.52
the likelihood of you actually naturally

6278.58 --> 6283.5199999999995
becoming gay is very low in my opinion

6286.02 --> 6288.8
you choose it

6294.48 --> 6300.178999999999
a troll said yeah well don't listen to

6296.639 --> 6303.179
trolls there's no like what Dell really

6300.179 --> 6303.179
no

6304.32 --> 6310.38
then Brandon is not doing streams

6307.5 --> 6312.3
because he has a new job and that job is

6310.38 --> 6313.679
right on the time slot when he would

6312.3 --> 6317.96
normally do his show so he's probably

6313.679 --> 6317.96
not going to do a show anytime soon

6333.119 --> 6337.38
so never been here what is that a

6336.239 --> 6339.599999999999
question

6337.38 --> 6343.28
is that a statement about yourself are

6339.6 --> 6343.280000000001
you asking me Eugene

6366.48 --> 6370.799999999999
some chemicals with mess with the Y

6369.119 --> 6373.639
chromosome

6370.8 --> 6373.639
uh

6373.679 --> 6381.4800000000005
Yeah well yeah of course yeah if you get

6377.82 --> 6383.219
poisoned or like dude but that all falls

6381.48 --> 6386.58
under trauma whether it's chemical

6383.219 --> 6390.54
trauma or social interaction trauma or

6386.58 --> 6392.639
like rape yeah influence

6390.54 --> 6396.5
that's influence

6392.639 --> 6396.5
it's not you're born with it

6400.44 --> 6405.96
I believe some people are born gay

6402.719 --> 6408.06
well they probably think that but it

6405.96 --> 6410.4
usually is a choice

6408.06 --> 6412.860000000001
now that choice might be very tempting

6410.4 --> 6415.679
especially if you have like typical gay

6412.86 --> 6419.219
traits naturally

6415.679 --> 6421.8
then yeah the likelihood of you at some

6419.219 --> 6424.26
point choosing that is higher

6421.8 --> 6427.1990000000005
but that's still the choice

6424.26 --> 6430.52
you can also choose to try to ignore the

6427.199 --> 6433.5599999999995
impulses and focus on other things focus

6430.52 --> 6435.06
on growing in a different way not

6433.56 --> 6436.9800000000005
utilizing

6435.06 --> 6440.84
The Temptations

6436.98 --> 6440.839999999999
it is a choice every time

6447.84 --> 6453.6
well look at geoshift you can agree with

6450.54 --> 6456.0
me all you like I'm very solid about my

6453.6 --> 6458.52
case it is a choice

6456.0 --> 6460.619
now that choice might be very easy very

6458.52 --> 6462.4800000000005
difficult right it doesn't

6460.619 --> 6464.4
just because it's a choice doesn't make

6462.48 --> 6466.44
it like oh that means it's always easy

6464.4 --> 6468.54
no no no it doesn't

6466.44 --> 6470.5199999999995
right it doesn't

6468.54 --> 6473.46
and there will always be people that

6470.52 --> 6475.5
choose to be gay because it's just too

6473.46 --> 6478.76
tough for them

6475.5 --> 6478.76
to try to be straight

6478.8 --> 6482.34
and like everybody wants them to be gay

6481.08 --> 6484.199
or something right that's very

6482.34 --> 6485.58
challenging

6484.199 --> 6489.599999999999
for so

6485.58 --> 6492.9
but it is a choice your actions are a

6489.6 --> 6495.54
choice and if you

6492.9 --> 6497.5199999999995
tell yourself that it isn't then you

6495.54 --> 6500.28
basically relinquish

6497.52 --> 6501.84
your connection to God that you have the

6500.28 --> 6503.94
choice and you

6501.84 --> 6507.0
you lower your

6503.94 --> 6509.219
standard to that of an animal because

6507.0 --> 6511.44
animals have no choice they just follow

6509.219 --> 6514.5
their impulses

6511.44 --> 6517.099999999999
humans are elevated above that they have

6514.5 --> 6517.1
the choice

6541.5 --> 6545.699
what do you think

6543.06 --> 6547.7390000000005
rumors about who built this their Dome

6545.699 --> 6549.96
is a straw man

6547.739 --> 6551.759999999999
I mean some people call it the Dome and

6549.96 --> 6554.52
they just say oh the Dome the Dome the

6551.76 --> 6557.099
Dome the Dome the Dome we need a

6554.52 --> 6559.92
specific format to encapsulate the

6557.099 --> 6561.360000000001
containment within a singular word that

6559.92 --> 6564.2390000000005
will

6561.36 --> 6566.04
seem to reference back to the Bible and

6564.239 --> 6568.98
that's why people just say Dome Dome

6566.04 --> 6571.86
Dome it's a dome yeah but mechanically

6568.98 --> 6574.32
physics wise

6571.86 --> 6576.179
yep there's plenty of people that don't

6574.32 --> 6577.739
claim it's a dome I don't claim it's a

6576.179 --> 6579.9
dome Nathan Oakley doesn't claim it's a

6577.739 --> 6583.379999999999
dome none of the FED panelists claims

6579.9 --> 6585.78
it's a dome or maybe 10th Man does but

6583.38 --> 6589.46
these very biblical

6585.78 --> 6589.46
right I don't know

6590.28 --> 6595.259999999999
it's still a straw man argument for a

6592.619 --> 6597.659
baller to bring the dome in

6595.26 --> 6600.54
because that's not the that's not like

6597.659 --> 6602.759999999999
the confirmed consensus among flat

6600.54 --> 6605.34
earther

6602.76 --> 6608.34
and firmament

6605.34 --> 6610.76
what does it even mean right it implies

6608.34 --> 6616.4400000000005
certain things it's not

6610.76 --> 6619.08
automatically the Dome or the container

6616.44 --> 6622.0199999999995
it's very like

6619.08 --> 6624.719
it's easier to think that it might be

6622.02 --> 6627.719
involved with that more than any any

6624.719 --> 6629.94
other thing but it's not automatically

6627.719 --> 6632.88
proof just because that seems the most

6629.94 --> 6636.44
likely thing it is supposed to represent

6632.88 --> 6636.4400000000005
you see it's complicated

6643.139 --> 6647.119
anyway I think I'm gonna round out the

6644.94 --> 6647.119
show

6650.94 --> 6656.46
are there more gaze in Flat Earth no

6655.38 --> 6659.6990000000005
no

6656.46 --> 6663.2390000000005
the ball ball earth religion

6659.699 --> 6664.199
turns out that the majority of them are

6663.239 --> 6666.178999999999
gay

6664.199 --> 6669.799999999999
now some of them are actually gay in

6666.179 --> 6669.8
denial but they act gay

6670.86 --> 6676.0199999999995
and they show gamma Behavior which is

6673.56 --> 6678.3
widely accepted so yeah no wonder like

6676.02 --> 6681.2390000000005
if you get grafted into a culture where

6678.3 --> 6682.619000000001
gay behavior is normal yeah no surprise

6681.239 --> 6685.0199999999995
you're gay even though you might not

6682.619 --> 6687.0
even be aware of it right there's plenty

6685.02 --> 6689.76
of Ballers out there that are gay and

6687.0 --> 6693.719
they don't even know it

6689.76 --> 6697.320000000001
and a lot of them are also asexual

6693.719 --> 6700.8
right because there's deactivated gaze

6697.32 --> 6702.0
gays that don't go after men they're not

6700.8 --> 6706.34
sexual

6702.0 --> 6706.34
I call that deactivated gaze

6706.8 --> 6711.119000000001
they can still just show typical gay

6709.26 --> 6712.92
behavior and Gamma Behavior which is

6711.119 --> 6716.28
like very close

6712.92 --> 6720.119
most Gammas are gay

6716.28 --> 6722.96
literally not just the slang they're

6720.119 --> 6722.96
literally gay

6728.639 --> 6735.08
Simon Dan is a little gay yeah he's he's

6732.119 --> 6737.639
probably a deactivated gay there's no

6735.08 --> 6739.92
sexual Vibes coming off him but he's

6737.639 --> 6743.3
very gay I agree

6739.92 --> 6743.3
in a colloquial sense

6753.48 --> 6761.28
just a little bit or actual little what

6757.5 --> 6763.5
okay this is getting really weird now I

6761.28 --> 6765.599
guess we all gotta have some fun

6763.5 --> 6768.54
sometimes you know

6765.599 --> 6772.679
I mean joking about gays to me is like

6768.54 --> 6775.92
one of the few things that actually

6772.679 --> 6778.82
like makes me less stressed out over my

6775.92 --> 6778.82
own homophobia

6781.44 --> 6786.0599999999995
right it's not my fault that I'm

6784.08 --> 6788.46
homophobic

6786.06 --> 6790.320000000001
and I can probably say that I was born

6788.46 --> 6794.0
that way

6790.32 --> 6794.0
unlike you gays

6794.28 --> 6799.32
squirt for me anyway

6797.159 --> 6800.699
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6799.32 --> 6804.719
like this show

6800.699 --> 6809.04
if you didn't then it might be a fact

6804.719 --> 6812.28
that you're gay might be no definitive

6809.04 --> 6814.739
conclusion but if you did like it then

6812.28 --> 6816.659
please don't forget the rogans it up and

6814.739 --> 6818.638999999999
if you haven't already subscribe to my

6816.659 --> 6820.679
channel and hit the Bell notification so

6818.639 --> 6822.54

6840.719 --> 6845.639
being gay and I think that everybody

6860.04 --> 6866.48

6861.96 --> 6866.4800000000005
minutes hope to see you there in chat

6867.0 --> 6871.44

6871.44 --> 6874.5199999999995
you're not welcome here

6875.159 --> 6882.0
your present your presence assaults me

6879.96 --> 6885.119
physically

6882.0 --> 6890.89
right so

6885.119 --> 6922.17
