93.96 --> 100.74
anyway the weather today is dreary and

98.04 --> 104.42
heavily clouded

100.74 --> 104.42
it's been kind of raining

104.939 --> 108.19999999999999
micro droplet

109.74 --> 113.78
it's not like big drops

114.18 --> 122.36000000000001
so it's like dreary and moist

118.439 --> 122.36
I mean plants are liking it though

124.259 --> 129.02
mint is still just exploding

135.06 --> 140.28
right

137.16 --> 142.57999999999998
hello Jeff gashead first in chat good to

140.28 --> 142.58
see you

143.22 --> 149.4
it is Tuesday the 3rd of October 2023

150.36 --> 153.36
foreign

156.319 --> 164.06
16 degrees Celsius wow that's a big dip

160.379 --> 164.06
it's not what they said would happen

166.86 --> 170.70000000000002
oh wait

169.379 --> 173.16
I thought it was a bit of a temperature

170.7 --> 175.07999999999998
dip wasn't there

173.16 --> 177.239
right and then next weekend it's gonna

175.08 --> 179.16000000000003
be a bit better

177.239 --> 180.72
but seems like today is just going to be

179.16 --> 183.379
a rainy day

180.72 --> 183.379
oh well

185.72 --> 191.66
yesterday was amazing I mean even

189.0 --> 191.66
with

192.0 --> 198.06
it's like some Trails being up there it

195.72 --> 200.819
was like warm I went out for groceries

198.06 --> 204.56
like in my shorts

200.819 --> 204.56
it was just really nice and warm

204.84 --> 210.0
but yeah today not so much

208.26 --> 212.459
that's why I got my sweater on again

210.0 --> 214.56
anyway hello Richard G good to see you

212.459 --> 216.78
Dr utker

214.56 --> 219.5
see you

216.78 --> 219.5
how are you doing

220.379 --> 223.159
uh

226.5 --> 232.68
if you can send out some prayers or nice

229.44 --> 234.84
thoughts to Divergent Droid he's like by

232.68 --> 239.04000000000002
sleeping right now

234.84 --> 241.94
but he's having a tough time with family

239.04 --> 241.94
being in the hospital

249.0 --> 254.299
right I I really hope it all works out

251.7 --> 254.29899999999998
for him

266.639 --> 273.06
okay take it easy though

270.12 --> 275.16
there you go

273.06 --> 277.4
yeah don't keep games running in the

275.16 --> 277.40000000000003
background

284.88 --> 287.419
right

290.1 --> 294.24
so

292.02 --> 297.0
again how are you guys doing probably

294.24 --> 299.58
still waking up a bit

297.0 --> 301.02
any thoughts on my show yesterday I got

299.58 --> 302.699
quite the

301.02 --> 308.24
I got some

302.699 --> 308.24
troll I'm gonna as well draw a gamma

309.0 --> 314.759
it was it didn't really seem even like

311.04 --> 316.68
an well yeah it was a troll

314.759 --> 319.639
started commenting on my show yesterday

316.68 --> 319.639
and the day before

319.68 --> 326.06
to remove some of those because they

321.66 --> 326.06
were just just pure at home

327.3 --> 332.759
so they're going around again

330.66 --> 335.52000000000004
I don't get a lot of troll comments even

332.759 --> 337.38
anymore a lot of really short ones that

335.52 --> 339.479
are just completely pointless like Sean

337.38 --> 341.88
Hawkins wrote them or something I I

339.479 --> 345.0
always just remove them

341.88 --> 347.9
because they don't talk about anything

345.0 --> 347.9
it's just stupid

347.94 --> 351.38
and creative at home

355.139 --> 358.34000000000003
but any thoughts

359.699 --> 365.52000000000004
do you guys agree I didn't get

363.24 --> 367.139
well maybe I did get feedback but I

365.52 --> 369.12
didn't really read the chat too

367.139 --> 372.44
carefully at the time

369.12 --> 372.44
because it was a ranting

374.039 --> 380.639
what do you guys think you think

377.52 --> 382.4
that that's real that is civil war is

380.639 --> 385.68
imminent

382.4 --> 387.9
I've been thinking about it and

385.68 --> 390.96
it's just that there might be other

387.9 --> 394.02
things that might happen with them

390.96 --> 397.58
like it might get really weird oh look

394.02 --> 397.58
look here we have here

397.8 --> 404.22
Sean Hawkins oh goody

401.819 --> 408.259
yeah you're a standard of measure John

404.22 --> 408.259
Hawkins so I reference you regularly

412.38 --> 418.46
I hear I'm creating a video game yeah

415.08 --> 418.46
it's none of your freaking business

425.46 --> 429.96
right but there's like other things that

427.44 --> 433.52
could be happening too but it's just

429.96 --> 433.52
it's too weird man

435.919 --> 441.29999999999995
but I don't want to like get political

438.479 --> 443.099
about it and go in more details like

441.3 --> 445.40000000000003
what I think could happen I

443.099 --> 447.96
it's just

445.4 --> 450.29999999999995
it's got what's gonna happen is gonna

447.96 --> 453.08
happen anyway

450.3 --> 453.08
at this point

456.3 --> 462.419
right but like theoretically these

460.139 --> 465.12
immigrants getting trained to be

462.419 --> 468.08
soldiers allegedly I'll just say

465.12 --> 468.08
allegedly okay

469.319 --> 473.96000000000004
through sources it yeah

477.18 --> 485.639
they might also end up like just being

481.02 --> 488.29999999999995
the soldiers for other Foreign Wars that

485.639 --> 488.3
might unroll

490.5 --> 493.28
seriously

493.46 --> 499.02
it might not even be for or well it's

496.68 --> 501.599
like optional but it might not be

499.02 --> 503.94
primarily even designated

501.599 --> 507.24
this project too

503.94 --> 510.12
do the fighting like against the

507.24 --> 511.979
against U.S citizens it might be like to

510.12 --> 514.7
basically replace the Army because

511.979 --> 514.6999999999999
they're all gay

515.7 --> 521.9590000000001
so they're just going to use them

518.039 --> 521.959
for their Foreign Wars instead

522.899 --> 528.54
that and that's gonna look look

525.3 --> 530.2199999999999
horrendous by the way

528.54 --> 533.16
for the United States as an

530.22 --> 535.86
international image but

533.16 --> 537.02
that could also happen

535.86 --> 538.32
I realized that

537.02 --> 540.42
[Music]

538.32 --> 543.12
after thinking it's not just one

540.42 --> 545.399
ultimate thing that could be done

543.12 --> 549.24
with that it could be getting it could

545.399 --> 552.3
be getting weirder is what I'm saying

549.24 --> 554.64
right so there's a little addendum to my

552.3 --> 556.9399999999999
uh the main statement of my show

554.64 --> 556.9399999999999
yesterday

563.7 --> 571.019
because the how how the elites plan and

567.48 --> 573.0600000000001
run things is really freaking weird

571.019 --> 577.32
and there they really are treating

573.06 --> 577.3199999999999
people like they're just robots

578.58 --> 583.62
so it's like they don't care whether it

581.279 --> 586.459
looks completely insane or or hurts

583.62 --> 586.4590000000001
feelings or whatever

589.22 --> 593.94
or or looks completely insane it's like

592.08 --> 596.0400000000001
they don't care anymore they only care

593.94 --> 598.1400000000001
about power so that they might be

596.04 --> 600.899
capable of doing things that you totally

598.14 --> 604.459
wouldn't expect because you'd never be

600.899 --> 604.459
crazy enough to think of that

604.8 --> 609.14
well I am crazy enough to think of it

609.6 --> 612.44
a lot of things

618.26 --> 625.08
and so yeah that way I might like

622.92 --> 627.959
give you a glimpse of what could be

625.08 --> 630.9590000000001
happening anyway

627.959 --> 630.959
uh

632.76 --> 638.54
yeah I kind of late the video game

634.8 --> 638.54
situation to rest I mean

638.76 --> 643.74
because I'm like the problem is is that

641.459 --> 646.8599999999999
with what I'm doing now

643.74 --> 648.24
is mostly like well tinkering the fine

646.86 --> 650.5790000000001
details

648.24 --> 654.54
and I still have to like somehow figure

650.579 --> 657.3
out how to more efficiently roll out

654.54 --> 660.3
actual checks because it's going to be

657.3 --> 663.899
such a cluster [ __ ] like

660.3 --> 668.6999999999999
to have that just in a bunch of tables

663.899 --> 668.7
is like almost not really doable

669.0 --> 673.8
I might have to open like a separate

670.8 --> 677.0999999999999
sheet for it but it is complicated

673.8 --> 680.66
it's like it's it's more complicated to

677.1 --> 680.66
organize than I originally thought

685.08 --> 689.7
[Music]

686.279 --> 692.36
so but yeah I will get to it

689.7 --> 692.36
at some point

693.3 --> 699.54
but like the creative part is like yeah

696.12 --> 701.579
I've I've built a lot of things

699.54 --> 703.68
and there's still some like weird little

701.579 --> 705.66
details that I like forgot and then

703.68 --> 706.62
remembered like hey wait wasn't there

705.66 --> 708.66
this

706.62 --> 711.0600000000001
oh yeah

708.66 --> 712.26
and then like oh quickly work that in

711.06 --> 715.3199999999999
there

712.26 --> 718.56
because I just it's such a you it was

715.32 --> 720.72
originally already such a huge list as I

718.56 --> 722.8199999999999
showed you on paper

720.72 --> 724.74
that it's like it becomes kind of easy

722.82 --> 727.38
to overlook Little Things

724.74 --> 729.48
because there is it because I didn't add

727.38 --> 731.82
it in a summary by accident or whatever

729.48 --> 733.62
right that's the hazard of doing it on

731.82 --> 737.519
paper

733.62 --> 741.44
but yeah I have pretty much worked out

737.519 --> 741.44
like how things should work in it

743.76 --> 746.959
don't even know what that is

751.339 --> 757.0400000000001
hello by the way blue pilled Evolution

754.2 --> 757.0400000000001
good to see you

757.68 --> 761.399
trolls have been in high gear like yeah

759.42 --> 763.64
no no but it's not strange it's not just

761.399 --> 763.64
you

763.98 --> 768.48
is by the way really funny the way you

766.019 --> 773.22
formulated that because the way you

768.48 --> 776.48
formulated that insinuates that you too

773.22 --> 776.48
maybe a troll

779.639 --> 785.22
like trolls have been in high gear of

782.22 --> 787.6800000000001
late or maybe it's just me like maybe

785.22 --> 789.1800000000001
you're just the only troll that has gone

787.68 --> 790.68
in high gear that's

789.18 --> 793.8599999999999
how that reads

790.68 --> 795.8389999999999
potentially sorry I'm just nitpicking

793.86 --> 799.76
here it just looked funny

795.839 --> 799.7600000000001
you're not a troll at least

801.6 --> 808.6800000000001
not against flat earthers

804.54 --> 812.459
it was I know it wasn't intentional

808.68 --> 816.62
but that's why I tried to highlight it

812.459 --> 816.6199999999999
because of the intricacies of language

820.279 --> 828.8
three D Graphics right yeah I don't need

824.16 --> 828.8
a 3D Graphics program it's not a 3D game

834.54 --> 838.56
sounds interesting though

836.519 --> 839.519
I doubt that I could run it on my

838.56 --> 842.459
computer

839.519 --> 843.6
with Windows 7 and it would work I I

842.459 --> 846.779
doubt it

843.6 --> 849.66
my computer is not like

846.779 --> 853.26
ready for serious 3D

849.66 --> 855.24
editing and video editing so

853.26 --> 857.04
hey that flat fellow good to see you

855.24 --> 859.76
it's been a while

857.04 --> 859.76
how are you doing

860.399 --> 865.139
but yeah in all seriousness thanks for

862.68 --> 868.1999999999999
the tip Sean Hawkins I I know that's

865.139 --> 869.7
actually a genuine tip thank you but I

868.2 --> 872.639
don't think my computer can like

869.7 --> 875.94
properly run that and besides I was

872.639 --> 878.48
never ever planning to like do actual 3D

875.94 --> 878.48
modeling

878.76 --> 885.42
like once I get to that stage

883.079 --> 888.66
like basically what the plan was is to

885.42 --> 891.42
make the game mechanically work and then

888.66 --> 894.8389999999999
have really basic Graphics which is like

891.42 --> 896.459
super similar to well the graphics of

894.839 --> 899.1600000000001
old bull the dash

896.459 --> 900.63
from the 80s where it's basically all

899.16 --> 902.1
characters that means

900.63 --> 904.98
[Music]

902.1 --> 908.1
it's a roulette it's non-spright bass

904.98 --> 910.5600000000001
it's not imagery based it's just still

908.1 --> 913.74
graphics and a lot of them and how they

910.56 --> 915.7199999999999
exchange right and so that way the game

913.74 --> 918.0600000000001
can really be tested properly without

915.72 --> 920.1600000000001
getting distracted from Graphics I don't

918.06 --> 922.5
have to add up a giant amount of

920.16 --> 927.8389999999999
graphics and keep Graphics really simple

922.5 --> 931.56
like in 90s age Graphics simple as in

927.839 --> 933.24
just a couple of blocks with pixels I

931.56 --> 936.2399999999999
have to like basically copy paste

933.24 --> 939.54
whatever is suitable for it and use that

936.24 --> 941.22
and modify that in Photoshop and that's

939.54 --> 942.36
what I'll use for graphics I don't need

941.22 --> 944.4590000000001
anything

942.36 --> 945.899
for that except for what I already have

944.459 --> 948.3
on my computer

945.899 --> 951.12
so that way I can build basically or ask

948.3 --> 952.62
Adam or something maybe he's inspired to

951.12 --> 958.139
do it but I could probably do it myself

952.62 --> 961.74
I dude I made graphics on my Amiga

958.139 --> 964.5
1200 for Burger Dash unfortunately yeah

961.74 --> 967.019
that's all useless now

964.5 --> 970.019
but I had a whole bunch of graphs I used

967.019 --> 973.019
imagine 3D and like had steel blocks and

970.019 --> 975.779
so it was actually 3D rendered and it

973.019 --> 977.22
was really good texture it looked really

975.779 --> 980.1
badass

977.22 --> 982.8000000000001
but yeah it's it of course had a

980.1 --> 985.8000000000001
lighting Source issues and

982.8 --> 988.26
because it will be like uh when you call

985.8 --> 993.079
that it won't be like genuine 3D looking

988.26 --> 993.079
it would be continually parallel looking

993.48 --> 1000.019
in the basic version of it the basic

998.16 --> 1002.66
Graphics that I would make

1000.019 --> 1005.0600000000001
while eventually there could actually be

1002.66 --> 1009.3199999999999
a Sprite engine

1005.06 --> 1011.54
with real 3D animated live 3D graphics

1009.32 --> 1013.5790000000001
and splush effects and explosions that

1011.54 --> 1016.399
look really cool that could all be made

1013.579 --> 1020.06
on top of it that's the whole trick

1016.399 --> 1022.1
it's like the game is a mechanism I'm

1020.06 --> 1024.319
making the mechanism

1022.1 --> 1026.959
and the graphics and like people could

1024.319 --> 1029.1789999999999
literally come and say like hey can I

1026.959 --> 1031.819
make a graphics engine for that and like

1029.179 --> 1033.5
yeah try it out and then another person

1031.819 --> 1035.299
comes hey I got this really cool idea

1033.5 --> 1036.439
like a theme for it like slightly

1035.299 --> 1038.48
altered and

1036.439 --> 1040.8190000000002
this kind of and pretty cool graphics

1038.48 --> 1043.04
ideas like oh yeah go ahead and like

1040.819 --> 1045.199
multiple people could literally use the

1043.04 --> 1047.78
same game and just like add other

1045.199 --> 1051.94
Graphics engines on top of it

1047.78 --> 1051.94
that was my plan

1051.98 --> 1057.26
and then hopefully

1054.32 --> 1059.059
eventually I could I don't know scrape

1057.26 --> 1062.96
some money together to get a real

1059.059 --> 1066.1399999999999
serious person like make us really high

1062.96 --> 1069.5
end Graphics engine for it so it could

1066.14 --> 1072.1000000000001
look like amazing like really amazing 3D

1069.5 --> 1075.799
looking with like

1072.1 --> 1078.98
Better Than Life 3d

1075.799 --> 1082.94
and quicker the game would be quicker

1078.98 --> 1085.1
yeah than most typical 3D games

1082.94 --> 1088.8200000000002
so it's like it would be amazing looking

1085.1 --> 1091.52
yet still very good very usable on

1088.82 --> 1093.74
older computers that that's the idea

1091.52 --> 1096.5
behind it I mean it's not gonna run on

1093.74 --> 1097.9
some 90s PC or whatever

1096.5 --> 1101.299
but

1097.9 --> 1103.3400000000001
Windows 98 that's probably not gonna

1101.299 --> 1106.52
happen maybe it would even I don't know

1103.34 --> 1108.1999999999998
probably not but definitely like on

1106.52 --> 1111.1399999999999
Windows 7 or

1108.2 --> 1113.1200000000001
or before that even

1111.14 --> 1115.8200000000002
and under

1113.12 --> 1119.539
other platforms too eventually I mean I

1115.82 --> 1122.299
would love to it to be an app also on

1119.539 --> 1124.22
iPhone if that's if if they'd allow that

1122.299 --> 1126.3799999999999
I don't know maybe I don't

1124.22 --> 1128.96
know or Android all those other things

1126.38 --> 1130.94
that I really know very little about

1128.96 --> 1133.48
because I don't even have a smartphone

1130.94 --> 1133.48
okay

1135.26 --> 1141.62
yep I know Sean Hawkins wow you actually

1138.38 --> 1145.46
know something huh

1141.62 --> 1147.6789999999999
but yeah Amiga was the best graphics

1145.46 --> 1151.3400000000001
computer made at the time

1147.679 --> 1155.24
it had a hyper beautiful efficient

1151.34 --> 1158.299
system with Incredible little power

1155.24 --> 1160.94
behind it even like the processors were

1158.299 --> 1164.72
not that great yet it could achieve all

1160.94 --> 1166.94
that unbelievable graphics

1164.72 --> 1170.059
like surreal

1166.94 --> 1171.44
like some of it looked like actual 3D

1170.059 --> 1173.84
life

1171.44 --> 1177.2
like for example super Stardust had like

1173.84 --> 1180.4399999999998
a tunnel game part that looked that was

1177.2 --> 1182.66
all rendered 3D but they had like so

1180.44 --> 1184.52
many elaborate yeah it was done so

1182.66 --> 1188.66
elaborately

1184.52 --> 1190.28
that it really looked like well

1188.66 --> 1194.1200000000001
like modern

1190.28 --> 1196.039
actual 3D would look almost I mean when

1194.12 --> 1198.26
you compare it now you realize it's a

1196.039 --> 1200.84
lot more primitive but I mean it did the

1198.26 --> 1204.559
trick man it was like 3D before there

1200.84 --> 1209.08
was 3D and I'm serious like Amiga had 3D

1204.559 --> 1209.08
before there was actual 3D

1209.299 --> 1215.36
it was unbelievable what it could do and

1212.539 --> 1218.5
and yeah and it got ruined got

1215.36 --> 1218.5
completely [ __ ] over

1219.2 --> 1225.26
then they did the stupid Amigo CD 32 or

1223.4 --> 1227.8600000000001
whatever and then had like the worst

1225.26 --> 1227.86
games ever

1229.46 --> 1236.299
like embarrassment like ugly really

1233.78 --> 1238.52
ugly and stupid

1236.299 --> 1239.66
tedious

1238.52 --> 1241.4
yeah

1239.66 --> 1243.679
so yeah but

1241.4 --> 1245.6000000000001
the old Amiga didn't have that issue had

1243.679 --> 1247.8200000000002
a lot of games

1245.6 --> 1249.5
not all of them good but some of them

1247.82 --> 1252.62
were just astounding

1249.5 --> 1255.46
like especially like cyber and

1252.62 --> 1258.7399999999998
futuristic oriented cyber Tech robotic

1255.46 --> 1262.1200000000001
Graphics were like there were a lot of

1258.74 --> 1262.1200000000001
really amazing looking games

1266.96 --> 1270.3400000000001
and I kind of miss it

1270.559 --> 1274.16
although of course the resolution now

1272.78 --> 1276.1399999999999
when you compare it is like pretty

1274.16 --> 1279.5600000000002
shitty

1276.14 --> 1280.7
but yeah whatever

1279.56 --> 1284.74
[Music]

1280.7 --> 1284.74
English language is full of landmines

1287.419 --> 1291.4
hello I'm a PO by the way good to see

1289.22 --> 1291.4
you

1296.539 --> 1300.26
running the program is one thing

1298.76 --> 1302.98
rendering

1300.26 --> 1302.98
okay

1304.28 --> 1307.28
well

1307.52 --> 1312.86
the issue is I I don't really plan to

1310.22 --> 1315.799
like really 3D

1312.86 --> 1318.3799999999999
make stuff like that

1315.799 --> 1320.6
I was actually thinking rather of like

1318.38 --> 1322.7600000000002
trying to just have photographs of

1320.6 --> 1326.7199999999998
things

1322.76 --> 1328.82
to use real textures

1326.72 --> 1330.559
because you can have like really

1328.82 --> 1334.9399999999998
Beautiful Textures that way if you just

1330.559 --> 1338.1789999999999
take like a photograph something

1334.94 --> 1340.94
and also there's like really good uh

1338.179 --> 1342.5
like typical textures that are looping

1340.94 --> 1344.6000000000001
and all that

1342.5 --> 1346.34
for all kinds of things that I will

1344.6 --> 1347.4189999999999
definitely want to use because yeah I'm

1346.34 --> 1351.1499999999999
gonna have

1347.419 --> 1352.3400000000001
all these different materials

1351.15 --> 1354.14
[Music]

1352.34 --> 1356.539
and they really gotta look like those

1354.14 --> 1359.6000000000001
materials

1356.539 --> 1362.48
so I'm probably gonna end up just like

1359.6 --> 1365.559
photographing a bunch of things and then

1362.48 --> 1365.559
photoshopping that

1367.34 --> 1374.02
yeah that's cool okay dude you got some

1374.419 --> 1379.3400000000001
are you advertising or something we get

1377.84 --> 1381.9399999999998
it blender it does a lot of things

1379.34 --> 1381.9399999999998
that's cool

1389.88 --> 1393.8590000000002
[Music]

1414.62 --> 1420.32
do you use blender Sean Hawkins are you

1417.5 --> 1423.64
using it are you like enthusiastic about

1420.32 --> 1423.6399999999999
it or something what's going on

1428.83 --> 1431.98
[Music]

1437.12 --> 1443.7199999999998
hey dank good to see you you sent it 98

1440.78 --> 1446.6299999999999
wow oh okay so you're actually trained

1443.72 --> 1449.1200000000001
with it that's cool

1446.63 --> 1450.98
[Music]

1449.12 --> 1453.2199999999998
what kind of things have you made with

1450.98 --> 1453.22
it

1456.32 --> 1460.12
in the last 25 years

1464.14 --> 1468.2800000000002
hello Oz good to see you

1483.86 --> 1486.86
foreign

1488.36 --> 1492.02
yeah by the way in the meantime I am

1490.28 --> 1494.48
gonna eat this Illuminati calzone

1492.02 --> 1497.9189999999999
because I'm really freaking hungry

1494.48 --> 1497.919
I've not eaten much yesterday

1499.1 --> 1506.559
I think I'm fasting or something

1502.58 --> 1506.559
just playing around never was oh okay

1507.559 --> 1511.539
well that's that's too bad

1511.64 --> 1516.22
to be put out a recent podcast

1520.94 --> 1525.799
yeah yeah blue pill Evolution I agree

1523.779 --> 1527.539
Dubai has

1525.799 --> 1529.1589999999999
he does some interesting interview

1527.539 --> 1531.26
videos

1529.159 --> 1534.4
I watched a bit of that last one it was

1531.26 --> 1536.72
like it's getting better

1534.4 --> 1539.659
like less

1536.72 --> 1542.179
petulant or was that the right word less

1539.659 --> 1544.3400000000001
arrogant like gets because he sometimes

1542.179 --> 1546.74
just has that I mean a lot of flat

1544.34 --> 1548.8999999999999
earthers that are in the field and this

1546.74 --> 1550.76
channels that tend to do that

1548.9 --> 1552.98
it's getting better and better I'm just

1550.76 --> 1554.48
feeling it like he and he has been

1552.98 --> 1555.5
improving for quite a while but he's

1554.48 --> 1559.24
like

1555.5 --> 1559.24
it's getting like interesting

1561.799 --> 1565.12
good luck on the game thanks

1581.36 --> 1585.9399999999998
right now I'm gonna take a bite cheers

1594.74 --> 1596.86
um

1619.4 --> 1624.26
good to see some new material not just

1621.32 --> 1626.36
reposted old stuff yeah

1624.26 --> 1628.8799999999999
and and that also means that he's

1626.36 --> 1631.279
basically like getting in contact with

1628.88 --> 1633.14
like people that dig around

1631.279 --> 1636.32
more

1633.14 --> 1638.3600000000001
that's great that's those are the

1636.32 --> 1640.3999999999999
sources that's like

1638.36 --> 1641.84
often that's not even like the people

1640.4 --> 1644.9
that do the channel

1641.84 --> 1646.6999999999998
it's people that are like

1644.9 --> 1647.96
that really like the channel and just

1646.7 --> 1650.559
help out

1647.96 --> 1650.559
sources

1654.64 --> 1657.719
[Music]

1666.7 --> 1673.64
right but yeah I like most of what

1671.36 --> 1674.8999999999999
Eric debate talks about I just think

1673.64 --> 1677.3600000000001
that

1674.9 --> 1679.9
his veganism ideas are kind of

1677.36 --> 1679.8999999999999
nonsensical

1705.58 --> 1709.539
Atlantean conspiracy yeah yeah

1715.82 --> 1721.039
I haven't actually like watched the

1718.64 --> 1724.0590000000002
videos of that

1721.039 --> 1724.059
but I like

1728.36 --> 1735.6399999999999
is that the book Atlantic conspiracy

1732.14 --> 1735.64
I saw it like yeah

1736.159 --> 1740.24
maybe man it's a long time ago I think

1738.5 --> 1742.1
that I did watch like the Atlantic

1740.24 --> 1743.84
conspiracy but it was way back and there

1742.1 --> 1746.32
were all kinds of stories like that

1743.84 --> 1746.32
going around

1747.5 --> 1751.24
I don't exactly remember it

1753.98 --> 1757.1200000000001
not right now anyway

1759.44 --> 1765.159
it's good to cut back on me yeah sure

1761.72 --> 1765.159
blue pill that well yeah

1766.34 --> 1772.039
definitely don't overdo it like I'm

1768.98 --> 1775.1200000000001
very sparing with my meat

1772.039 --> 1775.12
I'm very picky

1776.0 --> 1780.039
but I definitely need it

1780.679 --> 1786.14
like if I skip me too much many times I

1783.919 --> 1788.24
literally like feel super depleted and I

1786.14 --> 1791.3290000000002
can't concentrate anymore

1788.24 --> 1791.329
[Music]

1799.82 --> 1806.3999999999999
[Music]

1828.559 --> 1831.76
for me on average

1833.24 --> 1838.179
the best way is to like

1836.12 --> 1840.9799999999998
eat one day

1838.179 --> 1844.52
vegetarian and then eat

1840.98 --> 1846.6200000000001
a meal with meat the next day

1844.52 --> 1849.02
and then repeat like that's the best way

1846.62 --> 1850.58
that's the ideal

1849.02 --> 1854.74
for my system

1850.58 --> 1854.74
I don't even get that really

1855.26 --> 1859.6
I'm lucky to eat meat like twice a week

1902.2 --> 1909.02
so this is probably gonna be my last

1905.799 --> 1911.26
illuminatric at uduminati croissant for

1909.02 --> 1911.26
a while

1912.89 --> 1915.98
[Music]

1914.48 --> 1918.58
because I'm not going to be able to

1915.98 --> 1918.58
afford it

1919.52 --> 1924.62
in the next three weeks when I somehow

1922.1 --> 1927.9189999999999
have to scrape mod it together to even

1924.62 --> 1930.58
get food and smokes and all that so

1927.919 --> 1930.5800000000002
yeah

1930.62 --> 1935.779
I can't afford it I love him

1933.2 --> 1938.14
they're great can't afford it they have

1935.779 --> 1938.14
any more

1970.06 --> 1973.1599999999999
[Music]

1988.34 --> 1990.9399999999998

[Music]

2002.32 --> 2005.22
hmm

2010.36 --> 2017.019
oh and I'm running out of supplements

2012.94 --> 2019.6000000000001
only two types all right

2017.019 --> 2022.1200000000001
smite

2019.6 --> 2025.4399999999998
um yeah

2022.12 --> 2028.299
what's it called spirulina

2025.44 --> 2029.98
the other one but I don't know maybe I

2028.299 --> 2032.82
could like do without I don't know what

2029.98 --> 2032.82
would happen really

2036.88 --> 2041.2
but I at least got enough vitamin C

2039.22 --> 2042.94
there so maybe it wouldn't matter too

2041.2 --> 2044.38
much if I'd miss them for a couple of

2042.94 --> 2046.299
weeks

2044.38 --> 2047.0800000000002
what I'm not really looking forward to

2046.299 --> 2049.72
that

2047.08 --> 2051.899
and also they are in the discount right

2049.72 --> 2051.899
now

2051.94 --> 2058.8
so if I'd somehow be able to get like

2055.96 --> 2058.8
is that gonna be

2060.46 --> 2064.2
like 60 Euros or something

2067.48 --> 2071.5
I think 60 should probably be enough I

2070.419 --> 2073.5989999999997
hope

2071.5 --> 2075.46
that would be fantastic because then I

2073.599 --> 2078.06
could get that and I'd have enough for

2075.46 --> 2078.06
what is it

2082.359 --> 2085.44
four months

2090.22 --> 2095.08
so yeah who knows maybe maybe some of

2092.98 --> 2096.94
you have that option

2095.08 --> 2100.38
to help me out there

2096.94 --> 2100.38
for something this specific

2100.839 --> 2107.7599999999998
otherwise

2103.0 --> 2107.76
I just have to do with what I got left

2116.92 --> 2124.8

2121.599 --> 2124.8

2132.96 --> 2136.09
[Music]

2240.579 --> 2243.96
weather to get it though

2244.0 --> 2251.02
Nah by the way no not until tomorrow

2247.78 --> 2252.88

2252.88 --> 2255.9
most of the show

2256.56 --> 2262.32
coming up yeah thank you very much dank

2259.0 --> 2262.32
I really appreciate that support

2277.18 --> 2283.7999999999997
all right what

2279.4 --> 2283.8
can we talk about

2300.64 --> 2303.64
foreign

2316.78 --> 2322.6600000000003
well if nobody's gonna suggest anything

2320.02 --> 2325.18
then I could talk about

2322.66 --> 2328.48
I'm just noticing that

2325.18 --> 2331.3199999999997
how unbelievably much

2328.48 --> 2331.32
the

2331.96 --> 2336.579
why do you say that

2334.359 --> 2339.0
the public Consciousness has changed

2336.579 --> 2339.0
like

2340.839 --> 2346.42
that the game now works differently

2344.26 --> 2349.2400000000002
is that everybody that has anybody else

2346.42 --> 2350.7400000000002
noticed that you should have

2349.24 --> 2353.3799999999997
like that it's

2350.74 --> 2355.4199999999996
so much more overt now that things are

2353.38 --> 2356.8
corrupted

2355.42 --> 2359.859
and that

2356.8 --> 2363.46
when people like go fully crazy with it

2359.859 --> 2364.42
in government like nobody else stops

2363.46 --> 2368.32
them

2364.42 --> 2370.3
it's like they want to show it like

2368.32 --> 2374.2200000000003
like they all do even the ones that are

2370.3 --> 2374.2200000000003
part of it that are keeping it a secret

2375.099 --> 2379.6600000000003
like they all want it to be seen out

2377.74 --> 2382.56
there I want to be known how [ __ ]

2379.66 --> 2382.56
corrupt everything is

2388.18 --> 2394.1189999999997
I've never seen that before overtly on

2392.02 --> 2397.2599999999998
media

2394.119 --> 2397.26
like that

2402.82 --> 2407.1400000000003
and it's really it's so crazy that it is

2405.339 --> 2410.32
like you could definitely state that

2407.14 --> 2412.18
it's like broken everybody's mind

2410.32 --> 2413.98
there's a whole bunch of people that

2412.18 --> 2415.8999999999996
literally will not be able to handle

2413.98 --> 2419.26
that that's going on

2415.9 --> 2421.06
so they will fall back on the old image

2419.26 --> 2423.099
that they thought it was

2421.06 --> 2424.72
and we'll get continual cognitive

2423.099 --> 2427.38
dissonance whenever facing anything

2424.72 --> 2427.3799999999997
about this

2430.72 --> 2437.14
right kind of like that guy from the

2434.26 --> 2439.599
from the government that I met

2437.14 --> 2442.18
like a few weeks ago

2439.599 --> 2443.8
like just on a checkup meeting and I

2442.18 --> 2444.52
started asking about like what you

2443.8 --> 2446.44
didn't

2444.52 --> 2450.28
do you know David Ike do you know Alex

2446.44 --> 2452.5
Jones really like public right I mean

2450.28 --> 2455.1400000000003
everybody's heard of that and he would

2452.5 --> 2456.22
like like saying like no never heard of

2455.14 --> 2457.96
them

2456.22 --> 2460.24
like

2457.96 --> 2462.96
that's a person that literally can't

2460.24 --> 2462.9599999999996
handle anything

2468.04 --> 2472.18
that literally denies everything from

2470.079 --> 2474.579
existing by claiming that he has never

2472.18 --> 2476.14
heard of it like that's genuinely what

2474.579 --> 2477.52
was going on

2476.14 --> 2480.4
yeah

2477.52 --> 2483.04
there's no way

2480.4 --> 2484.6600000000003
that you're a public figure that

2483.04 --> 2487.0
literally professionally for the

2484.66 --> 2488.44
government talks with people

2487.0 --> 2491.98
and you've never heard of that there's

2488.44 --> 2493.96
no way just no way

2491.98 --> 2495.82
it's even been in the news and all that

2493.96 --> 2497.8
that they banned him

2495.82 --> 2499.96
right they banned David Ike I mean

2497.8 --> 2501.1600000000003
there's no freaking way that you've

2499.96 --> 2505.48
never heard of him

2501.16 --> 2507.64
absolutely nonsense so

2505.48 --> 2510.099
that's just people out there that are

2507.64 --> 2512.6189999999997
just like pretend literally like in a

2510.099 --> 2514.78
panic pretending like it's not happening

2512.619 --> 2515.92
so they're just compartmentalizing

2514.78 --> 2518.099
themselves

2515.92 --> 2522.2400000000002
Living in a Dream completely

2518.099 --> 2522.2400000000002
surrendering to whatever is happening

2523.24 --> 2528.4799999999996
I wonder how many people out there live

2526.0 --> 2528.48
like that

2531.64 --> 2536.3799999999997
and if such a thing could actually be

2534.72 --> 2539.5
cataloged

2536.38 --> 2541.78
to be measured like how many people are

2539.5 --> 2543.82
actually stuck in that state

2541.78 --> 2545.32
I mean you could definitely test it you

2543.82 --> 2547.0
could test such things

2545.32 --> 2549.76
if you can get them to answer questions

2547.0 --> 2552.579
be part of the

2549.76 --> 2555.3390000000004
some kind of uh what you call that

2552.579 --> 2558.82
petition thing

2555.339 --> 2562.02
sort of not a petition though but

2558.82 --> 2562.02
what you call that in English

2572.859 --> 2576.9
a survey that's the word right

2577.24 --> 2581.4599999999996
if you could like do a survey on that

2587.5 --> 2592.839
I should have always had been surveys

2590.2 --> 2595.2999999999997
about that to really test like how well

2592.839 --> 2596.619
is everybody faring like how many people

2595.3 --> 2598.9
are like

2596.619 --> 2601.9
at the wheel that can't actually handle

2598.9 --> 2606.3
reality about what's happening

2601.9 --> 2606.3
that's very important to know you see

2612.7 --> 2615.8399999999997
[Music]

2616.74 --> 2621.0989999999997
David I used to be a football yeah and a

2619.48 --> 2624.96
football coach and then he started

2621.099 --> 2624.96
talking about reptilians and then

2626.079 --> 2630.0
it was all shame to all hell

2655.839 --> 2658.44
hmm

2660.099 --> 2667.119
rarely watching I don't watch the news

2663.88 --> 2669.819
I flick through alternative news and I

2667.119 --> 2673.9
watch some Alex Jones sometimes and like

2669.819 --> 2675.88
through that I get everything I need

2673.9 --> 2678.1600000000003
I keep like up to date and roughly

2675.88 --> 2682.359
what's happening I don't actually watch

2678.16 --> 2685.66
the news because well I don't want to be

2682.359 --> 2688.119
psionically lobotomized

2685.66 --> 2692.22
which is what would happen if I'd force

2688.119 --> 2692.2200000000003
myself to watch the news every time

2693.94 --> 2700.0
could agitate me to no end

2696.7 --> 2703.18
they always for such horrendous crap in

2700.0 --> 2706.68
there I don't wanna with I don't want to

2703.18 --> 2706.68
be subjected to that ever

2709.599 --> 2714.46
get my news from 4chan okay dank yeah I

2712.42 --> 2718.26
guess that could work

2714.46 --> 2718.26
we got a good source there

2758.92 --> 2761.099
foreign

2777.77 --> 2780.94
[Music]

2800.02 --> 2806.319

2803.56 --> 2809.819
bird show in like months

2806.319 --> 2809.819
I'm gonna blame the weather

2809.859 --> 2812.339
okay

2813.46 --> 2817.92
I don't know but it's like weird

2827.5 --> 2833.8
people see used to Pride itself from

2829.54 --> 2835.3
being important yeah now BBC was great

2833.8 --> 2837.6400000000003
in the 90s

2835.3 --> 2841.3
that's fantastic

2837.64 --> 2844.319
and even still in the 2000s but like

2841.3 --> 2846.88
somewhere halfway there it just really

2844.319 --> 2849.7
got messed up

2846.88 --> 2852.94
I started to get like the

2849.7 --> 2856.98
like around when Obama got into office

2852.94 --> 2856.98
it really started to [ __ ] up

2857.8 --> 2862.48
before that already but that's when it

2859.96 --> 2864.579
like became when they all went insane in

2862.48 --> 2866.56
sjw and stuff

2864.579 --> 2869.819
like the BBC was like one of the

2866.56 --> 2869.819
forerunners of that crap

2869.92 --> 2874.839
like out of nowhere it's like oh yeah

2871.96 --> 2876.88
you oh you're that standard okay and now

2874.839 --> 2880.56
suddenly you're like exactly the

2876.88 --> 2880.56
opposite standard just out of nowhere

3498.48 --> 3504.44
and wrench everybody absolutely not

3501.599 --> 3504.44
going to do that

3508.14 --> 3512.7
all that happens is it's not some I

3510.9 --> 3515.88
don't think it's anybody that has a

3512.7 --> 3518.0989999999997
wrench yeah people get banned while

3515.88 --> 3519.839
you're literally in the chat and

3518.099 --> 3522.42
everybody's looking at it everybody with

3519.839 --> 3525.68
a wrench should be seeing that they're

3522.42 --> 3525.6800000000003
getting banned and they don't

3526.559 --> 3532.099
and just disappear that's not anybody in

3529.319 --> 3532.099
chat doing that

3546.54 --> 3549.44
foreign

3557.24 --> 3562.74
whatever's happening it's completely

3559.619 --> 3564.42
messing up YouTube's live chat I mean do

3562.74 --> 3566.3999999999996
they just want to get rid of the live

3564.42 --> 3568.7400000000002
chat is that it they just want to [ __ ]

3566.4 --> 3571.799
it up so bad this is like okay move it

3568.74 --> 3574.2599999999998
and just make it as atrocious as

3571.799 --> 3577.44
conceivably possible

3574.26 --> 3580.2000000000003
so that we can just delete it just like

3577.44 --> 3583.14
get rid of it because everybody hates it

3580.2 --> 3585.24
it's only trolls now only trolls

3583.14 --> 3587.04
immediately taking control over the

3585.24 --> 3591.0789999999997
entire Channel

3587.04 --> 3591.079
[ __ ] everything up on purpose

3591.42 --> 3595.559
then what you want you you just want to

3593.52 --> 3597.78
shut down don't you you just want to

3595.559 --> 3600.119
delete it all

3597.78 --> 3602.6400000000003
you got your power and now you want

3600.119 --> 3606.119
everything to shut down

3602.64 --> 3609.0
so we get nothing absolutely nothing and

3606.119 --> 3611.28
all just starve to death boring our

3609.0 --> 3613.88
asses off that's what you really want

3611.28 --> 3613.88
don't you

3624.48 --> 3627.48
foreign

3671.64 --> 3674.64
no

3678.839 --> 3685.5789999999997
somebody would see that happy

3682.2 --> 3685.5789999999997
somebody would see

3700.92 --> 3705.96
okay fine how about this I'll just keep

3703.98 --> 3708.839
my chat open

3705.96 --> 3710.16
for 15 minutes after I close down the

3708.839 --> 3713.24
show

3710.16 --> 3713.24
see what's happening

3717.48 --> 3720.96
I don't think it's gonna amount to

3719.22 --> 3725.64
anything though because they literally

3720.96 --> 3727.02
disappear in the middle of the show is

3725.64 --> 3729.54
that happy

3727.02 --> 3732.24
while they were chatting while I was

3729.54 --> 3734.64
seeing them and then suddenly they are

3732.24 --> 3737.04
banned and there's no notification of it

3734.64 --> 3739.98
that's what happened it wasn't afterward

3737.04 --> 3743.0
in the middle of the conversation they

3739.98 --> 3743.0
suddenly disappeared

3744.54 --> 3750.159
not after

3747.07 --> 3750.159
[Music]

3755.7 --> 3759.839
yeah talking about which I better check

3757.74 --> 3762.5
it right now because you might have been

3759.839 --> 3762.5
disappeared

3765.359 --> 3769.0989999999997
bet that he'd love doing that

3781.799 --> 3784.04
foreign

3801.079 --> 3805.099
you don't seem to be in there

3808.559 --> 3811.2200000000003
whatever

3817.76 --> 3822.5400000000004
I don't know I think it's some kind of

3820.92 --> 3824.76
moderator hack

3822.54 --> 3825.7799999999997
YouTube moderator hack something like

3824.76 --> 3827.7000000000003
that

3825.78 --> 3831.119
somebody's got a code key and they can

3827.7 --> 3834.5589999999997
just [ __ ] around with anybody's Channel

3831.119 --> 3834.559
I don't know what the hell it is

3862.319 --> 3864.92
hmm

3875.4 --> 3878.6600000000003
yeah that is that

3884.819 --> 3889.2599999999998
but it only really happens to certain

3887.16 --> 3891.18
people

3889.26 --> 3894.3190000000004
I mean it doesn't seem like zept happy

3891.18 --> 3894.319
doesn't get kicked out

3894.54 --> 3900.5
so whoever is doing it they're out for

3896.579 --> 3900.5
specific flat earthers

3927.69 --> 3933.449
[Music]

3940.26 --> 3943.26
foreign

3976.099 --> 3981.059
yes it's none of your damn business

3978.78 --> 3982.799
though I'm not gonna talk about my

3981.059 --> 3985.619
[ __ ] video I will rather just sit

3982.799 --> 3988.859
here and be silent as and everybody just

3985.619 --> 3990.48
mutters around and brings nothing of

3988.859 --> 3993.18
value

3990.48 --> 3997.819
so that I can literally not talk about

3993.18 --> 3997.819
anything for a [ __ ] hour straight

3998.819 --> 4003.7
and then I'm gonna yell about it because

4000.5 --> 4003.7
it's embarrassing

4005.359 --> 4008.98
how about that

4006.799 --> 4008.98
foreign

4025.96 --> 4031.539
should I just start reviewing

4028.94 --> 4034.64
anti-flatter authors

4031.539 --> 4038.92
maybe I'll just become one of the other

4034.64 --> 4038.92
hundreds of shows that do that

4039.44 --> 4046.359
when nobody ever actually brings

4042.16 --> 4046.359
anything to the table

4047.24 --> 4053.2599999999998
and I have nothing to talk about

4049.099 --> 4053.26
currently I have no real subject

4094.46 --> 4099.44
all right

4095.839 --> 4103.219
I said look what else is on YouTube oh

4099.44 --> 4107.0199999999995
yeah well who cares that's even worse

4103.219 --> 4107.02
I know what the hell is wrong with today

4109.37 --> 4112.7699999999995
[Music]

4121.339 --> 4125.739
are they sick right now

4123.259 --> 4125.739
oh

4129.199 --> 4134.3589999999995
is there any other drinks you can mix up

4132.38 --> 4138.6990000000005
real quick

4134.359 --> 4138.6990000000005
no mostly just fine vitamin C

4144.259 --> 4150.02
and the most important thing is like

4146.6 --> 4154.2390000000005
just take it easy then I guess

4150.02 --> 4154.2390000000005
sorry to hear that you're sick Richard G

4158.0 --> 4162.52
Sweden is using military now yeah

4163.04 --> 4169.1
yeah they're because the police can't

4165.799 --> 4172.179
really handle the hand grenades that are

4169.1 --> 4172.179
being tossed at them

4184.819 --> 4189.1
dude go [ __ ] yourselves come back

4200.179 --> 4206.3
I can always review my looping Earth

4202.9 --> 4209.179
that's hilarious at that b yeah I could

4206.3 --> 4211.52
do that just recycle old [ __ ]

4209.179 --> 4212.6
nobody really seems to care about that

4211.52 --> 4215.5
much

4212.6 --> 4215.5
I don't know

4222.5 --> 4227.48
you thought it was interesting yeah me

4224.42 --> 4230.62
too it is interesting it's probably what

4227.48 --> 4230.62
the realm is really like

4231.56 --> 4234.52
looping

4261.739 --> 4266.599999999999
okay guys I think this might literally

4264.199 --> 4268.339999999999
I've just had

4266.6 --> 4271.2390000000005
I think I'm like

4268.34 --> 4271.2390000000005
it's not working

4273.86 --> 4278.599999999999
like

4275.48 --> 4280.4
I need meat I think it's literally that

4278.6 --> 4283.159000000001
I need to eat meat and that I haven't

4280.4 --> 4285.08
eaten enough of it recently I've had a

4283.159 --> 4287.719
lot of meat hunger

4285.08 --> 4289.46
recently but it's just too [ __ ]

4287.719 --> 4292.3
expensive

4289.46 --> 4292.3
and

4293.199 --> 4298.339999999999
I don't know maybe maybe partially maybe

4296.6 --> 4300.08
it's the weather transition I don't know

4298.34 --> 4303.4400000000005
what the hell is going on with just not

4300.08 --> 4309.1
rolling today I don't know why what the

4303.44 --> 4309.099999999999
[ __ ] is rolling just ah

4323.65 --> 4328.04
[Music]

4324.94 --> 4331.4
Penny kind what

4328.04 --> 4333.699
yeah great I'm taking ashwagandha that's

4331.4 --> 4333.699
great

4345.219 --> 4352.64
it definitely like staves off dread

4348.86 --> 4354.32
Sensations like actual dread feelings

4352.64 --> 4358.4800000000005
get rid of that

4354.32 --> 4358.48
very very freaking helpful

4359.36 --> 4361.839999999999
okay

4367.88 --> 4372.58
time is the worst impatient yeah

4372.62 --> 4378.08
well then just see it like this it's

4375.739 --> 4380.599999999999
like oh well if you can be patient then

4378.08 --> 4383.54
suffer

4380.6 --> 4386.0
yeah it's it's the pain box it's the

4383.54 --> 4388.58
Dune pain box you know you must be

4386.0 --> 4389.9
patient it's not an option you now must

4388.58 --> 4391.219
fight

4389.9 --> 4393.92
that

4391.219 --> 4395.42
that's the challenge challenge it the

4393.92 --> 4399.26
fight the thing that you're going to

4395.42 --> 4402.86
pre-occupy yourself is with is not

4399.26 --> 4405.8
getting impatient not getting restless

4402.86 --> 4407.239
to sit still and do nothing and be good

4405.8 --> 4409.88
with it

4407.239 --> 4412.339999999999
with absolutely nothing no activity

4409.88 --> 4414.4400000000005
nothing to pull you in nothing to

4412.34 --> 4417.400000000001
distract you to pull you away from what

4414.44 --> 4417.4
is currently happening

4423.08 --> 4428.179
especially when it's painful but you

4425.48 --> 4430.459999999999
still gotta do it because that's like

4428.179 --> 4431.78
that's the most aggravating thing I

4430.46 --> 4434.78
could think of

4431.78 --> 4438.88
and it's exactly what you must do and

4434.78 --> 4438.88
when you do it you get a price

4440.12 --> 4444.88
and when you don't do it you don't get a

4442.52 --> 4444.88
prize

4451.04 --> 4454.04
foreign

4469.58 --> 4474.76
I mean Einstein literally ruined

4471.98 --> 4478.5199999999995
Dimensions the understanding of them

4474.76 --> 4481.6990000000005
Einstein ruined it

4478.52 --> 4483.040000000001
by grafting in with time it's the

4481.699 --> 4484.699
dumbest

4483.04 --> 4488.239
clunkiest

4484.699 --> 4492.099999999999
thing anybody could ever do it's really

4488.239 --> 4492.099999999999
cheap too I mean it's really stupid

4500.54 --> 4506.12
like I completely just don't care about

4503.78 --> 4511.3
time as a dimension anymore it's like no

4506.12 --> 4511.3
there's more Dimensions they're not time

4512.0 --> 4517.78
there are other depths

4514.46 --> 4517.78
through yeah

4521.84 --> 4527.679
good up down

4524.0 --> 4530.98
Left Right forward backward and through

4527.679 --> 4530.9800000000005
and back

4532.159 --> 4539.98
yeah that's

4534.5 --> 4539.98
the other dimension through and back

4541.04 --> 4547.04
see you can literally just like

4544.219 --> 4549.26
literally Define it it's not that

4547.04 --> 4553.42
difficult

4549.26 --> 4557.8
up down left right forward backward

4553.42 --> 4557.8
through and back

4563.96 --> 4566.62
okay

4582.26 --> 4587.7390000000005
temper and spread my yeah but it doesn't

4584.48 --> 4590.599999999999
work like that Emma Peel

4587.739 --> 4591.5599999999995
and I wasn't squeezing it out or

4590.6 --> 4593.84
anything

4591.56 --> 4596.84
I was just letting it bloom

4593.84 --> 4599.360000000001
which you can't like turn that off and

4596.84 --> 4602.08
then save it for later it's not peanut

4599.36 --> 4602.08
butter or something

4602.12 --> 4605.199
It's Just Energy

4610.219 --> 4616.1
but I mean yeah I I started I've done

4613.64 --> 4619.159000000001
things with it I've made a lot of

4616.1 --> 4622.04
progress and a whole giant table here on

4619.159 --> 4623.9
Bula Dash like a big Improvement so I've

4622.04 --> 4626.659
definitely done stuff

4623.9 --> 4628.719
but I also like kind of need a break and

4626.659 --> 4633.639999999999
but I guess that the needing a break

4628.719 --> 4634.94
also kind of like blocked my role

4633.64 --> 4637.76
[Music]

4634.94 --> 4641.0599999999995
but hey to be fair I feel like a lot

4637.76 --> 4642.38
healthier now because like even four

4641.06 --> 4644.120000000001
days ago

4642.38 --> 4646.1
I was like

4644.12 --> 4648.199
it was starting to almost feel like

4646.1 --> 4649.52
nightmares that's because that's the

4648.199 --> 4652.5199999999995
weird thing when I when you get

4649.52 --> 4654.320000000001
inspiration too along too heavy

4652.52 --> 4658.0
eventually like it'll turn the

4654.32 --> 4658.0
nightmares if you can't let it go

4658.1 --> 4663.4400000000005
those things will haunt you

4661.46 --> 4667.82
when you know you can't get it yet

4663.44 --> 4670.339999999999
because I dude I see like the boulder

4667.82 --> 4673.759999999999
dash that I'm that I want to make I'm

4670.34 --> 4675.92
literally seeing that in 3D in front of

4673.76 --> 4677.780000000001
my face continually

4675.92 --> 4680.2390000000005
and yeah that's really cool it's that's

4677.78 --> 4683.78
exactly what it's gonna be yeah but I

4680.239 --> 4687.62
can't get it though right now

4683.78 --> 4691.78
and that is actually really frustrating

4687.62 --> 4691.78
so then I have to turn it off eventually

4692.78 --> 4698.719
but when you turn that off then

4694.76 --> 4701.3
everything turns off my rapid fluid

4698.719 --> 4703.58
talking and ideas and scattering one

4701.3 --> 4705.26
idea to another bouncing right that all

4703.58 --> 4707.719
stops

4705.26 --> 4711.6990000000005
you can't just turn one thing off and

4707.719 --> 4711.699
then not turn everything else off too

4715.76 --> 4721.04
so I'm gonna blame that part yeah part

4718.28 --> 4723.679
of the reason why there's such a huge

4721.04 --> 4726.76
silences in this show

4723.679 --> 4726.76
for this point

4737.54 --> 4743.9
yeah I don't feel down Emma Peel I don't

4741.02 --> 4745.9400000000005
feel down I don't feel negative emotions

4743.9 --> 4751.159
even in that sense

4745.94 --> 4753.62
I'm just like it's just closed it's

4751.159 --> 4756.379999999999
not like who doesn't want no it's like

4753.62 --> 4758.92
it's out it's just nothing coming out

4756.38 --> 4758.92
it's like

4760.159 --> 4765.62
nothing she's nothing coming out that's

4762.62 --> 4767.96
what it's like not depression not all

4765.62 --> 4770.36
the feeling anyway no it's just nothing

4767.96 --> 4772.58
just nothing coming up

4770.36 --> 4774.38
that's it

4772.58 --> 4777.14
you have to wait

4774.38 --> 4778.6990000000005
like this spring dries up every now and

4777.14 --> 4781.780000000001
then you have to wait

4778.699 --> 4781.78
and then comes back

4787.64 --> 4793.42
that's how it works with me

4790.34 --> 4793.42
I don't get down

4794.12 --> 4799.28
I get down when I feel like there's a

4796.46 --> 4801.32
setback yesterday I was kind of dumb

4799.28 --> 4803.12
and the day before I was written out

4801.32 --> 4804.38
yesterday wasn't even that much that the

4803.12 --> 4807.44
day before

4804.38 --> 4811.12
how that show ended on Sunday I was

4807.44 --> 4816.0199999999995
really demoralized after that for hours

4811.12 --> 4819.0199999999995
like really [ __ ] demoralized

4816.02 --> 4821.120000000001
but then I like went on 24 7 had a talk

4819.02 --> 4824.360000000001
with like creation bear and it was

4821.12 --> 4826.82
really nice and uplifting so that that

4824.36 --> 4831.699
kind of fixed that

4826.82 --> 4831.699
but I've been fine after that point

4835.219 --> 4841.1
I'm mostly a bit worried about that I'm

4838.46 --> 4842.9
just gonna be distracted by being hungry

4841.1 --> 4845.4800000000005
all the time and that my concentration

4842.9 --> 4847.94
is gonna start to falter more and more

4845.48 --> 4850.339999999999
that's what I'm worried about because

4847.94 --> 4852.82
I don't have money to just have normal

4850.34 --> 4852.82
food

4854.0 --> 4858.219
I talked with my healer lately no

4858.56 --> 4863.120000000001
like

4860.06 --> 4865.76
like last week I call him it's all just

4863.12 --> 4869.0
fine it's not gonna help yeah my healer

4865.76 --> 4871.780000000001
is not gonna make me less hungry

4869.0 --> 4871.78
the contrary

4876.94 --> 4883.599999999999
sometimes you're

4878.96 --> 4883.6
North Pole sometime what okay

4883.64 --> 4886.84
all righty dokie

4895.64 --> 4899.92
I'm not really bipolar I'm a peel

4901.52 --> 4904.900000000001
I'm just intense

4918.62 --> 4923.8
like that is really the thing with me I

4920.9 --> 4923.799999999999
am just intense

4930.38 --> 4935.900000000001
we're talking about yeah but you also

4932.36 --> 4939.32
said you are like me this is

4935.9 --> 4942.04
yeah whatever okay fine

4939.32 --> 4942.04
I get it

4954.08 --> 4956.44
right

4962.26 --> 4969.88
similarities Behavior okay well yeah

4965.719 --> 4969.88
well maybe you're just intense too

4970.12 --> 4974.98
bipolar is just some kind of like box

4975.02 --> 4982.719
they make out of it I don't buy any it's

4977.96 --> 4982.719
all this boxing in is all horseshit

4982.76 --> 4988.88
people have traits skill ranges

4986.96 --> 4991.58
side effects

4988.88 --> 4994.159000000001
and then they have to like

4991.58 --> 4997.219
puzzle it together as well and then deal

4994.159 --> 5001.659
with it to create an identity and I mean

4997.219 --> 5006.2390000000005
yeah it's all very complicated

5001.659 --> 5006.239
and those boxes only make things worse

5011.8 --> 5016.78
because those boxes oh if you accept

5014.32 --> 5018.5199999999995
them then people will address you for

5016.78 --> 5020.62
those boxes and they will not address

5018.52 --> 5022.900000000001
you for

5020.62 --> 5025.239
your actual on the moment

5022.9 --> 5028.36
characteristics

5025.239 --> 5030.759999999999
they will just end up trying to classify

5028.36 --> 5033.12
those characteristics to place them in

5030.76 --> 5033.12
the box

5033.4 --> 5039.219
and thereby overlooking the details

5037.36 --> 5041.58
that's because that's what people tend

5039.219 --> 5041.58
to do

5045.64 --> 5050.5
so I don't like it I and you might have

5048.04 --> 5051.46
noticed right when I analyze people all

5050.5 --> 5055.8
the time

5051.46 --> 5055.8
do I use these types of words

5055.96 --> 5063.0
no I never use those

5059.38 --> 5064.78
type of box words those

5063.0 --> 5067.179
psychiatry

5064.78 --> 5069.34
designations

5067.179 --> 5071.8
because I literally think they're

5069.34 --> 5076.8
horseshit

5071.8 --> 5076.8
they're a poor excuse for an analysis

5094.0 --> 5099.159
right because all of that is mostly

5096.159 --> 5101.799999999999
based on like how really dumb people

5099.159 --> 5103.9
that don't have any control over

5101.8 --> 5107.56
themselves

5103.9 --> 5109.78
or oversight how they typically start

5107.56 --> 5112.360000000001
falling in behavioral patterns that's

5109.78 --> 5113.62
what that's all based on manic

5112.36 --> 5118.179
depressive

5113.62 --> 5119.92
or bipolar or hyperactive like that's

5118.179 --> 5124.06
literally about people that have

5119.92 --> 5125.92
absolutely no self-control or analysis

5124.06 --> 5127.4800000000005
don't know what to do with what they are

5125.92 --> 5130.0
and they don't even see it

5127.48 --> 5133.299999999999
that's what that's based on

5130.0 --> 5135.58
but if you're actually smart

5133.3 --> 5139.12
and aware

5135.58 --> 5142.0599999999995
and you're you have the will to engage

5139.12 --> 5146.08
in discipline then all those things

5142.06 --> 5149.56
literally are can be malleable into

5146.08 --> 5152.5
something very constructive

5149.56 --> 5154.06
instead of being that box you're gonna

5152.5 --> 5155.739
be defined with

5154.06 --> 5158.56
yeah

5155.739 --> 5161.919999999999
I mean you could box me in and say oh

5158.56 --> 5163.96
yeah arwanese it was hyperactive it was

5161.92 --> 5167.679
rich to hyperactive

5163.96 --> 5170.7390000000005
like a a ADHD

5167.679 --> 5173.8
at one point and it was also suspected

5170.739 --> 5176.86
of having schizoid traits

5173.8 --> 5178.84
and also a bit bipolar at this mood

5176.86 --> 5183.58
swings that were very strong

5178.84 --> 5186.46
yeah yeah a lot so helpful oh oh look oh

5183.58 --> 5188.86
now we can before our witness the crazy

5186.46 --> 5192.82
person oh yes

5188.86 --> 5195.82
yes oh I'm the crazy person sure yeah I

5192.82 --> 5198.0
don't take medication though at all like

5195.82 --> 5198.0
that

5199.08 --> 5204.46
and

5201.04 --> 5207.0
I'm trying to like work

5204.46 --> 5210.159
with what is in me

5207.0 --> 5212.26
including the intense parts and

5210.159 --> 5214.239
sometimes that can be tricky

5212.26 --> 5216.9400000000005
sometimes they could just completely

5214.239 --> 5219.159
shoot past all purpose like get it

5216.94 --> 5221.638999999999
completely wrong terrible timing

5219.159 --> 5224.86
whatever and other times it's fantastic

5221.639 --> 5225.76
and it's like wow like it's a little bit

5224.86 --> 5228.58
of magic

5225.76 --> 5230.860000000001
and that's what I can do with it

5228.58 --> 5233.139
and that's just because I'm an intense

5230.86 --> 5235.299999999999
person I'm an intense person

5233.139 --> 5238.84
hi

5235.3 --> 5241.860000000001
speed function like my internal world is

5238.84 --> 5241.860000000001
very fast

5243.1 --> 5248.56
like my Consciousness is at a high

5245.5 --> 5253.179
frequency like very high

5248.56 --> 5254.38
like so high that it alienates me from

5253.179 --> 5257.8
normal people

5254.38 --> 5260.26
is not a joke it literally alienates me

5257.8 --> 5263.02
from normal people because I'm always

5260.26 --> 5265.4800000000005
thinking at high rates always fast

5263.02 --> 5267.639
always complicated

5265.48 --> 5268.599999999999
and it just I can't help it I can't stop

5267.639 --> 5272.1990000000005
it

5268.6 --> 5275.620000000001
because I get bored if I try to stop it

5272.199 --> 5277.659
and like that drives me absolutely

5275.62 --> 5279.94
insane

5277.659 --> 5283.12
so I'm just always doing stuff to my

5279.94 --> 5286.259999999999
head always just like a computer just

5283.12 --> 5286.26
processing things

5288.76 --> 5294.76
is that hyperactive

5291.52 --> 5296.5
or is that hyperactive just a very poor

5294.76 --> 5299.4400000000005
analysis of

5296.5 --> 5303.82
a way of being

5299.44 --> 5306.638999999999
I am a high frequency intellect as in

5303.82 --> 5309.219
yeah I might be messy here and there

5306.639 --> 5311.62
and have emotional issues oh yeah for

5309.219 --> 5313.78
sure although not as bad as some people

5311.62 --> 5315.099999999999
out there but I still do very much

5313.78 --> 5316.179
palpable

5315.1 --> 5319.96
right

5316.179 --> 5324.04
but I also for function at an incredibly

5319.96 --> 5327.719
High rate as in I get like really

5324.04 --> 5330.699
elaborate right on target ideas

5327.719 --> 5333.1
instantaneously out of nothing yeah that

5330.699 --> 5335.739
only works if you function at a very

5333.1 --> 5337.4800000000005
high frequency rate

5335.739 --> 5340.12
because when you function and they have

5337.48 --> 5343.419999999999
very high frequency rate in your brain

5340.12 --> 5345.94
it almost kind of bypasses time

5343.42 --> 5347.8
because the way your brain works is you

5345.94 --> 5351.339999999999
will get an idea

5347.8 --> 5353.92
and then before you know what it is

5351.34 --> 5356.56
you can already Define it

5353.92 --> 5359.56
before your understanding can you like

5356.56 --> 5362.1
my ideas work faster than my

5359.56 --> 5362.1
consciousness

5362.56 --> 5368.679
so sometimes I get an idea I can't even

5365.38 --> 5371.5
Define it but I know how it works

5368.679 --> 5375.1
but I just can't explain it yet

5371.5 --> 5377.739
and then like the process he it's like

5375.1 --> 5381.820000000001
that high frequency works on my

5377.739 --> 5385.0199999999995
translator part that is then oh now I

5381.82 --> 5385.0199999999995
can actually explain it

5385.06 --> 5390.76
did because yeah but the ideas are so

5388.06 --> 5392.7390000000005
incredibly fast that like a full-blown

5390.76 --> 5395.9800000000005
picture with all fractal implications it

5392.739 --> 5400.36
just boom it's there

5395.98 --> 5401.98
the whole thing all of it boom it's

5400.36 --> 5405.219
there it's like God announcing himself

5401.98 --> 5407.799999999999
like showing the picture you did it all

5405.219 --> 5410.5
in that one moment that's what happens

5407.8 --> 5413.139
when you have a very high frequency

5410.5 --> 5416.32
brain function

5413.139 --> 5417.400000000001
but it also alienates you from most

5416.32 --> 5419.86
people

5417.4 --> 5421.12
because it doesn't work like that with

5419.86 --> 5423.219
them

5421.12 --> 5426.28
and it's weird

5423.219 --> 5427.719
they always struggle to try to

5426.28 --> 5430.62
be

5427.719 --> 5430.62
understood

5455.38 --> 5460.26
I didn't know these things could be

5457.0 --> 5460.26
managed and altered yeah

5461.139 --> 5464.28
well yeah

5464.679 --> 5470.4400000000005
indeed like all these things oh you have

5468.159 --> 5472.839999999999
problems or what problems because we're

5470.44 --> 5474.239
not like gonna fit in your little slave

5472.84 --> 5477.04
box

5474.239 --> 5478.299999999999
slave hurting scumbags

5477.04 --> 5481.42
no no

5478.3 --> 5483.6990000000005
it means there's all these traits that

5481.42 --> 5486.78
are underdeveloped that you can

5483.699 --> 5489.58
literally work on

5486.78 --> 5492.639
completely internally

5489.58 --> 5496.659
and then actually make skills out of

5492.639 --> 5499.92
these aberrant things in you

5496.659 --> 5499.92
like my anger

5500.08 --> 5504.179
yeah you can utilize that

5504.46 --> 5509.199
you could just let be anger always be in

5506.92 --> 5511.6
the way always be that moment oh I'm

5509.199 --> 5514.48
embarrassing myself again or you could

5511.6 --> 5515.620000000001
like hmm well maybe I can use that anger

5514.48 --> 5518.739
and like

5515.62 --> 5521.699
I keep it on a lid and then at the right

5518.739 --> 5524.32
moment and give it a little bit extra

5521.699 --> 5526.12
toasty right

5524.32 --> 5528.4
because people get a kick out of that

5526.12 --> 5530.679
yeah and now suddenly that thing that

5528.4 --> 5532.599999999999
was just embarrassing and oh I'm not

5530.679 --> 5536.139
under control

5532.6 --> 5537.88
and suddenly you've got a skill out of

5536.139 --> 5539.86
it yeah that's what you're supposed to

5537.88 --> 5542.46
do in life with everything in you

5539.86 --> 5542.46
everything

5545.8 --> 5551.400000000001
except

5547.12 --> 5551.4
Pure Evil of course

5559.179 --> 5563.52
right so yeah I hope you guys definitely

5563.56 --> 5567.54
pay attention to that sort of thing

5573.46 --> 5578.86
all right but yeah sometimes the flow of

5575.92 --> 5581.56
the conversation I just like I'm like

5578.86 --> 5583.54
can somebody else take over I mean when

5581.56 --> 5585.280000000001
fed is gonna start in 50 minutes I'm

5583.54 --> 5587.0199999999995
gonna be there mostly just sitting there

5585.28 --> 5589.78
and just like uh letting the guys talk

5587.02 --> 5591.580000000001
so I'm so glad that I don't have to

5589.78 --> 5593.8
leave the show

5591.58 --> 5595.78
because I don't really feel like leading

5593.8 --> 5597.820000000001
a show right now to be fair but I'm

5595.78 --> 5601.679
doing it though but yeah they're giant

5597.82 --> 5601.679
gaps of Silence you know

5602.38 --> 5607.6
have I have met other high frequency

5604.3 --> 5610.78
people yes yeah plenty

5607.6 --> 5613.42
they're all very troubled

5610.78 --> 5615.58
because when you're high frequency you

5613.42 --> 5618.34
become very troubled because now you

5615.58 --> 5620.94
understand how [ __ ] horrifying things

5618.34 --> 5620.9400000000005
really are

5620.98 --> 5626.32
and you felt it when you understand that

5623.8 --> 5629.4400000000005
much you will know though you will feel

5626.32 --> 5632.799999999999
the devil's clawing at you people out

5629.44 --> 5635.44
there get really insidiously jealous and

5632.8 --> 5638.320000000001
envious to high frequency functioning

5635.44 --> 5639.759999999999
people especially when they just show

5638.32 --> 5642.099999999999
themselves it's like

5639.76 --> 5643.4400000000005
oh I'm gonna be somewhere of somewhere

5642.1 --> 5647.4400000000005
new and like

5643.44 --> 5650.32
I just lay down something really smart

5647.44 --> 5651.699
and yeah some people be like oh that's a

5650.32 --> 5656.259999999999
high function guy

5651.699 --> 5658.54
other people are like oh one of those

5656.26 --> 5661.179
and they will literally start bullying

5658.54 --> 5662.92
you and pushing you out

5661.179 --> 5665.4400000000005
and that's what high frequency

5662.92 --> 5668.4400000000005
functioning people know

5665.44 --> 5670.9
is that if they just show how they are

5668.44 --> 5672.82
too much people will like come after

5670.9 --> 5675.4
them and start bullying them because

5672.82 --> 5678.36
that literally happens it's happened all

5675.4 --> 5678.36
my [ __ ] life

5678.58 --> 5682.32
even before Flat Earth

5688.78 --> 5693.639
and with bullying and it's just like

5691.0 --> 5696.04
using peer pressure like always like oh

5693.639 --> 5698.02
you think you're better than me like no

5696.04 --> 5701.44
I don't even know who the hell you are

5698.02 --> 5704.620000000001
oh you think they're better like no

5701.44 --> 5707.138999999999
it's just other I somehow with how I am

5704.62 --> 5709.12
make other some other guys especially

5707.139 --> 5712.139
feel incredibly insecure about

5709.12 --> 5712.139
themselves somehow

5713.199 --> 5717.94
and they don't even realize that I'm

5715.42 --> 5721.4800000000005
kind of insecure about myself

5717.94 --> 5723.638999999999
and that I'm probably making them feel

5721.48 --> 5724.9
insecure because I'm making so much

5723.639 --> 5728.26
effort

5724.9 --> 5730.179
to put myself down and be presentable

5728.26 --> 5734.5
and cool

5730.179 --> 5737.88
to compensate for that I feel insecure

5734.5 --> 5737.88
for [ __ ] sake

5738.88 --> 5744.58
okay

5740.08 --> 5747.5199999999995
and they don't they don't make an effort

5744.58 --> 5750.28
they're sloppy as [ __ ] and they're like

5747.52 --> 5752.8
ugly and they just like uh

5750.28 --> 5754.659
and then they notice like oh somebody's

5752.8 --> 5756.34
did actually doing it right oh now they

5754.659 --> 5758.5599999999995
feel really shitty about themselves

5756.34 --> 5761.62
because they're not they're not making

5758.56 --> 5763.96
the effort they're just blatantly openly

5761.62 --> 5766.44
scumbags

5763.96 --> 5769.78
and when you're just doing good then

5766.44 --> 5772.96
automatically they're like oh

5769.78 --> 5775.0599999999995
damn it that makes me look really ugly I

5772.96 --> 5778.179
feel really bad about myself now let's

5775.06 --> 5780.34
bully the [ __ ] out of that scumbag let's

5778.179 --> 5783.28
let's project everything that about hate

5780.34 --> 5786.3
about myself onto them quickly

5783.28 --> 5786.3
and that's what happens

5793.48 --> 5800.82
yeah but I frequency people do like get

5796.78 --> 5800.82
the most amazing creative ideas

5801.46 --> 5806.44
and they always have like

5804.58 --> 5809.98
visions of like

5806.44 --> 5813.419999999999
how things are or are changing

5809.98 --> 5813.419999999999
like socially especially

5814.48 --> 5821.159
or they get really obsessed with like

5817.179 --> 5821.159
mechanical things and Technology

5822.28 --> 5826.179
because it's like a lot of high

5824.08 --> 5828.4
frequency people have that weird sort of

5826.179 --> 5830.9800000000005
transhumanist sensation I used to have

5828.4 --> 5832.839999999999
it with computers is like yeah computers

5830.98 --> 5835.48
are just really fast

5832.84 --> 5837.400000000001
and they don't they don't whine they

5835.48 --> 5838.9
don't complain they just do what you

5837.4 --> 5843.0599999999995
tell them to do and if you tell them

5838.9 --> 5843.0599999999995
wrong well then they don't get it wrong

5843.28 --> 5847.9
and

5845.199 --> 5851.62
so it's like some high frequency people

5847.9 --> 5853.679
like really resonate with computers

5851.62 --> 5857.04
and they don't they become like

5853.679 --> 5860.08
underdeveloped socially nerds

5857.04 --> 5862.48
what I mean a lot of nerds are very high

5860.08 --> 5864.34
frequency function they're just highly

5862.48 --> 5866.919999999999
underdeveloped socially or they get

5864.34 --> 5868.3
weird socially because they don't really

5866.92 --> 5869.5
develop it

5868.3 --> 5871.84
right

5869.5 --> 5874.3
but they are often very high frequency

5871.84 --> 5876.78
function in their brain in their

5874.3 --> 5876.78
consciousness

5878.679 --> 5885.6990000000005
because you need that you need that to

5881.98 --> 5887.28
be able to have like a a vast web of

5885.699 --> 5890.5
complicated

5887.28 --> 5893.62
cross-connected things to have a big

5890.5 --> 5896.02
picture and keep it all in Focus you

5893.62 --> 5898.719
need that high function or you will not

5896.02 --> 5902.080000000001
be able to do that properly you'll get a

5898.719 --> 5905.08
headache you won't be able to do it

5902.08 --> 5908.76
you need the high frequency

5905.08 --> 5908.76
function consciousness

5909.46 --> 5913.42
computers don't have to deal with

5911.02 --> 5915.6990000000005
emotions if you yeah exactly and that's

5913.42 --> 5917.9800000000005
what like a lot of trends

5915.699 --> 5919.36
that this for high frequency functioning

5917.98 --> 5922.12
people

5919.36 --> 5924.219
that's what makes it makes transhumanism

5922.12 --> 5925.84
appealing it's like oh computer can I

5924.219 --> 5928.9
just be a computer so I don't have to be

5925.84 --> 5930.28
bird-minded feeling like oh the Spock

5928.9 --> 5932.92
dilemma

5930.28 --> 5935.739
yeah we just have to suppress our feely

5932.92 --> 5938.82
emotions and be purely logical and like

5935.739 --> 5938.82
yeah that's because

5939.1 --> 5941.9800000000005
well

5940.239 --> 5944.98
with most of those people it's not even

5941.98 --> 5947.32
because of like their own feelings it's

5944.98 --> 5949.5599999999995
the whole world is just [ __ ] up and

5947.32 --> 5949.5599999999995
then

5949.6 --> 5953.4400000000005
not dealing with their feelings well and

5952.12 --> 5955.3
then they get in trouble with their

5953.44 --> 5957.5199999999995
feelings because everybody out there in

5955.3 --> 5959.9800000000005
the world gets in trouble with their

5957.52 --> 5961.900000000001
feelings

5959.98 --> 5963.879999999999
and then you start to hate feelings

5961.9 --> 5969.9
because every time when feelings get

5963.88 --> 5969.900000000001
involved people start to like harass you

5976.42 --> 5982.2390000000005
perhaps sometime in the future you could

5979.3 --> 5986.62
choose to become a computer

5982.239 --> 5989.62
oh my God that sounds so funny is that

5986.62 --> 5991.3
that be seriously that that is actually

5989.62 --> 5994.38
funny

5991.3 --> 5994.38
thank you for that

6001.679 --> 6008.179
was a good joke yeah a really

6004.26 --> 6008.179
unrealistic though I mean

6009.9 --> 6019.86
the point is about feelings is you just

6014.239 --> 6022.678999999999
have to learn to deal with it

6019.86 --> 6025.44
oh you don't like it

6022.679 --> 6028.26
oh it's too bad if you don't like it

6025.44 --> 6031.98
well that is gonna get worse and worse

6028.26 --> 6034.26
and worse and worse and worse until you

6031.98 --> 6037.739
find that literally nobody wants to deal

6034.26 --> 6039.9800000000005
with you anymore and hmm you might be a

6037.739 --> 6044.5199999999995
psychopath yeah yeah

6039.98 --> 6045.9
that's why you have to deal with your

6044.52 --> 6048.56
feelings

6045.9 --> 6048.5599999999995
you see

6067.44 --> 6073.46
okay well this last part of the show at

6069.659 --> 6078.36
least is kind of good now

6073.46 --> 6081.36
man this first part of the show was so

6078.36 --> 6081.36
vacant

6091.139 --> 6096.2390000000005
fears and not just fears just how your

6093.78 --> 6099.36
feelings work you have to accept that

6096.239 --> 6101.94
your feelings work the way they do

6099.36 --> 6104.42
recognition of what they are that they

6101.94 --> 6104.419999999999
are there

6105.0 --> 6112.46
because feelings are like relationships

6109.199 --> 6116.78
you can't just ignore them

6112.46 --> 6116.78
they'll just build more pressure

6118.26 --> 6125.280000000001
because feelings exist to be recognized

6121.38 --> 6126.86
to have that contact to be seen

6125.28 --> 6130.199
feelings

6126.86 --> 6134.219
strive to be perceived

6130.199 --> 6136.678999999999
you see and if you don't do that

6134.219 --> 6138.719
you got you got trouble

6136.679 --> 6140.58
I mean you could put them in a cage and

6138.719 --> 6143.78
all that but yeah that's gonna change

6140.58 --> 6143.78
your feelings over time

6144.42 --> 6151.56
and your feelings can die

6147.96 --> 6156.44
if you neglect them too much

6151.56 --> 6156.4400000000005
or become really bizarre and erratic

6161.639 --> 6167.219
especially like when there's like

6164.34 --> 6171.84
extreme trauma involved or whatever

6167.219 --> 6174.9800000000005
yeah so you gotta deal with him

6171.84 --> 6177.54
and like not just like oh no it's like

6174.98 --> 6179.459999999999
you have to basically have that

6177.54 --> 6182.28
sensation of like yeah you have feeling

6179.46 --> 6183.179
oh you have a weakness oh yeah you have

6182.28 --> 6187.139
it

6183.179 --> 6189.9
now recognize it and show it dare to

6187.139 --> 6192.719
show be strong enough to show that you

6189.9 --> 6195.0
have a weakness in that and that that's

6192.719 --> 6199.86
real

6195.0 --> 6202.44
yeah and then be strong with it like

6199.86 --> 6204.96
if you're strong enough then you can be

6202.44 --> 6207.419999999999
vulnerable and have those feelings have

6204.96 --> 6210.719
other people attack you for it

6207.42 --> 6214.52
and still be able to feel it defend

6210.719 --> 6214.52
against it and not be hurt

6214.56 --> 6218.580000000001
that's the point where I strive that's

6216.659 --> 6222.299999999999
where I'm striving for

6218.58 --> 6225.6
to achieve that specifically

6222.3 --> 6228.360000000001
so that I can be me and that it doesn't

6225.6 --> 6229.139
matter anymore what the world does at

6228.36 --> 6231.42
all

6229.139 --> 6233.28
even though I'm a freaking empath and

6231.42 --> 6235.38
really sensitive

6233.28 --> 6238.259999999999
it's like even if they managed to hurt

6235.38 --> 6241.02
me or like get catch me off guard in

6238.26 --> 6244.76
ways and then hurt me in that way that

6241.02 --> 6244.76
I'm still like yeah okay

6246.0 --> 6251.699
I've had worse

6247.92 --> 6254.46
than I have in the past so who I have

6251.699 --> 6257.04
right so that like it doesn't matter and

6254.46 --> 6259.199
I can still just feel my feelings be

6257.04 --> 6261.42
myself be honest and open even show a

6259.199 --> 6264.48
bit of vulnerability in there

6261.42 --> 6267.2390000000005
have people not accept me and like [ __ ]

6264.48 --> 6270.599999999999
all over me whatever and still be able

6267.239 --> 6273.119
to continue doing it and be honest and

6270.6 --> 6275.219
not build like like

6273.119 --> 6277.82
over time more and more layers of

6275.219 --> 6277.82
resentment

6278.46 --> 6282.42
so that there's only bitterness in the

6280.5 --> 6284.94
end no that's not gonna have I'm gonna

6282.42 --> 6287.46
keep feeling all that spectrum of

6284.94 --> 6289.32
everything that you've seen from me from

6287.46 --> 6293.159
anger to Passion into loving to

6289.32 --> 6296.28
protective to vengeful

6293.159 --> 6298.92
to Insidious all of those things

6296.28 --> 6301.139
will all continue on

6298.92 --> 6303.06
and they will all keep developing every

6301.139 --> 6307.7390000000005
aspect of them

6303.06 --> 6311.159000000001
every time and will try to place them

6307.739 --> 6313.199
in a suited position in a suited moment

6311.159 --> 6315.42
it's very difficult sometimes and

6313.199 --> 6317.5199999999995
sometimes I get it wrong sometimes it's

6315.42 --> 6320.219
just like weird enough it's like oh yeah

6317.52 --> 6322.9400000000005
[ __ ] it it happened it happened

6320.219 --> 6322.94
you know

6325.02 --> 6331.6990000000005
but what I don't do is show these things

6327.9 --> 6334.379999999999
because I just need more people

6331.699 --> 6337.86
that really think they're better than me

6334.38 --> 6340.679
to tell me that I shouldn't do that

6337.86 --> 6343.199
I don't need that to like oh I need

6340.679 --> 6348.54
people enough people to shame me for it

6343.199 --> 6348.54
and then I'll stop doing it yeah

6348.6 --> 6354.5
no

6350.82 --> 6354.5
definitely not gonna happen

6355.199 --> 6359.879999999999
isolation is a silent killer indeed and

6357.96 --> 6362.46
for me very palpable

6359.88 --> 6366.119
I've kept in a whole bunch of feelings

6362.46 --> 6369.96
especially in my preteens and also teens

6366.119 --> 6372.239
because I was afraid or because

6369.96 --> 6374.4
I felt that I did something I would get

6372.239 --> 6377.459999999999
beat up and I would have

6374.4 --> 6380.339999999999
yeah and that like

6377.46 --> 6382.92
that's like physically hurts my muscles

6380.34 --> 6384.179
like I can't physically feel pain from

6382.92 --> 6385.8
my muscles

6384.179 --> 6387.84
when that happens

6385.8 --> 6391.5
it feels like I could get a heart attack

6387.84 --> 6395.400000000001
or something sometimes if it's bad

6391.5 --> 6398.46
so I really strive to avoid that from

6395.4 --> 6402.42
happening to not get caught

6398.46 --> 6404.699
in a situation where I will be forced to

6402.42 --> 6407.9400000000005
suppress feelings because it could be

6404.699 --> 6410.58
dangerous to express them yeah I don't

6407.94 --> 6413.759999999999
get caught in positions where it's

6410.58 --> 6416.04
dangerous to express feelings

6413.76 --> 6417.96
don't get cornered I'm very paranoided

6416.04 --> 6420.659
that yeah if I'm gonna walk the street

6417.96 --> 6423.42
and I see some guys are hanging around

6420.659 --> 6426.0
with like I am gonna be [ __ ] aware of

6423.42 --> 6428.46
that because I know there's just

6426.0 --> 6431.34
monsters there they will just suddenly

6428.46 --> 6434.28
start cornering you and like try to

6431.34 --> 6438.96
produce you laugh or whatever

6434.28 --> 6439.92
yeah I know they do that I'm super aware

6438.96 --> 6442.7390000000005
of that

6439.92 --> 6445.7390000000005
I don't get caught and I can size up

6442.739 --> 6447.48
when I know they wouldn't do that to me

6445.739 --> 6450.0
because of

6447.48 --> 6451.98
the energy comparisons

6450.0 --> 6454.56
just know that and with other groups I

6451.98 --> 6456.78
know like yeah I'm definitely gonna walk

6454.56 --> 6459.360000000001
like a block

6456.78 --> 6461.82
I'm not gonna walk past that

6459.36 --> 6463.98
like I don't trust those guys in the

6461.82 --> 6467.58
night during the day it's usually fine

6463.98 --> 6469.799999999999
out here but some like there's kids here

6467.58 --> 6473.4
also that are just like just looking for

6469.8 --> 6478.34
trouble again in this time

6473.4 --> 6478.339999999999
kids around like lighting fireworks

6481.199 --> 6485.219
it's way too early for that

6483.6 --> 6487.8
anyway

6485.219 --> 6489.3
I'm gonna round out the show almost kind

6487.8 --> 6491.6990000000005
of a shame I wish I could have like

6489.3 --> 6494.52
erased that first hour and then now

6491.699 --> 6496.799999999999
continued an hour instead

6494.52 --> 6499.139
because I feel a lot more stable and

6496.8 --> 6501.8
fluid now

6499.139 --> 6501.8
oh well

6507.36 --> 6513.54
can be changed

6509.78 --> 6515.699
sorry to keep going on about it but all

6513.54 --> 6517.32
this is textbook manic depression

6515.699 --> 6521.94
bipolar

6517.32 --> 6524.28
can be changed in coach okay I'm appeal

6521.94 --> 6527.54
hey if the box works for you then use

6524.28 --> 6527.54
the Box you know

6528.0 --> 6530.659
fine

6532.26 --> 6536.46
if that helps you to classify it like

6534.78 --> 6538.32
that sure

6536.46 --> 6541.679
as long as you understand that it can

6538.32 --> 6543.719
indeed be changed and coached

6541.679 --> 6547.679
thing is I

6543.719 --> 6549.36
I'm changing it and I'm coaching it

6547.679 --> 6551.6990000000005
there is no box

6549.36 --> 6555.0199999999995
well you use the words you use the word

6551.699 --> 6555.0199999999995
those words are the Box

6555.06 --> 6560.76
that's the point

6557.159 --> 6562.08
the weather you see is them as such they

6560.76 --> 6564.96
are boxes

6562.08 --> 6567.239
because that's how it is used in the

6564.96 --> 6568.32
majority of people that's how they use

6567.239 --> 6570.78
it

6568.32 --> 6575.179
that's how it officially is used it's

6570.78 --> 6575.179
like a medical designation a box

6576.48 --> 6580.619
you can feel no I'm not about feeling

6578.82 --> 6584.719
it's not about feelings this is about

6580.619 --> 6584.719
just the context here

6585.54 --> 6590.34
I try to avoid using those using those

6588.719 --> 6592.7390000000005
types of boxes those types of

6590.34 --> 6597.92
descriptions I just go for the details

6592.739 --> 6597.919999999999
and it but you can do that I mean

6598.86 --> 6603.239
you don't like condemn people for having

6601.86 --> 6605.839999999999
it

6603.239 --> 6605.839999999999
you know

6607.56 --> 6611.6990000000005
forget the names of the conditions yeah

6609.6 --> 6614.04
but that's the whole point is that the

6611.699 --> 6616.879999999999
whole condition has been

6614.04 --> 6616.88
boxed

6617.04 --> 6622.26
it is defined it is viewed upon in a

6620.639 --> 6624.54
certain way and their standard

6622.26 --> 6627.5
procedures to deal with them

6624.54 --> 6627.5
they're boxed

6630.739 --> 6635.699
but there are things that come yes

6632.699 --> 6637.379999999999
absolutely absolutely I'm I'm all for

6635.699 --> 6639.78
that's what I'm saying

6637.38 --> 6641.9400000000005
I'm saying like no I don't even want to

6639.78 --> 6644.5199999999995
put them in boxes it's just traits it's

6641.94 --> 6646.259999999999
traits things that you can do things

6644.52 --> 6647.820000000001
with and that's what I try to talk about

6646.26 --> 6650.04
last half hour
