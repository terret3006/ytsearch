52.34 --> 57.17
platform you deem fit and also if you

55.01 --> 58.73

62.78 --> 68.44
day please also support my channel

65.57 --> 72.88999999999999
through the super chats my paypal

68.44 --> 78.62
patreon and my GoFundMe much obliged wow

72.89 --> 82.82
my volume is particularly high let's see

78.62 --> 87.74000000000001
if yeah this should be a little bit

82.82 --> 91.97
better sorry about that I forgot about

87.74 --> 95.96
the accept Facebook part yeah well look

91.97 --> 98.6
that was because of certain things that

95.96 --> 100.91
would happen I certainly don't feel like

98.6 --> 102.5
being shared on Facebook although we had

100.91 --> 106.31
this point what does it really matter

102.5 --> 109.07
because it's not just Facebook anymore

106.31 --> 112.25
it's just such a consorted effort of

109.07 --> 118.58
attacks from all sides from all banks

112.25 --> 121.4
and a lot of media platforms is I would

118.58 --> 123.67999999999999
yeah I'd basically be better off saying

121.4 --> 128.619
just please don't share me on any

123.68 --> 131.62900000000002
platform or I'd have to be very specific

128.619 --> 134.51
so that's why I basically don't say that

131.629 --> 140.10999999999999
anymore but yeah social media is really

134.51 --> 140.10999999999999
starting to suck with that

141.17 --> 151.42999999999998
it's a political crackdown anyway I got

150.59 --> 154.97
to Mara coffee

151.43 --> 162.77
I got tea although I drank most of it

154.97 --> 171.07999999999998
and I got some yummy blueberries mmm

162.77 --> 175.58
good stuff so all right

171.08 --> 179.18
the the eating the dirt therapy seems to

175.58 --> 182.66000000000003
be working I do already feel a lot

179.18 --> 187.52
better today than I did yesterday doing

182.66 --> 191.35
the same thing and nice orange juice as

187.52 --> 191.35000000000002
too early for orange juice for me but

194.68 --> 207.85
yeah hopefully all this stuff is gonna

200.15 --> 212.56
get out of the way calm down again and

207.85 --> 215.47
despite this I do really feel good

212.56 --> 218.36
that's the weird thing about it's like

215.47 --> 220.4
just as annoying nausea getting in the

218.36 --> 224.09
way but at the same time the rest of my

220.4 --> 227.53
system I feel really good quite

224.09 --> 227.53
confident about myself even

236.569 --> 244.64
the extreme the extreme heat yeah yeah

242.12 --> 250.12
it's oh I completely forgot to share the

244.64 --> 253.17999999999998
weather it's weird right so right now

250.12 --> 256.97
well there's some clouds over there

253.18 --> 259.82
hasn't really been raining but weird

256.97 --> 262.52000000000004
enough even in the early early morning I

259.82 --> 264.139
was looking up at the Sun that was

262.52 --> 267.83
pretty much at where I'm pointing the

264.139 --> 270.919
camera now and you it wasn't really

267.83 --> 273.85999999999996
behind one of those clouds but there was

270.919 --> 278.93
barely any Sun so there seems to be this

273.86 --> 282.11
thick fog up there I can't say it was

278.93 --> 284.81
formed by chemtrails not sure I haven't

282.11 --> 289.039
seen any spraying like that before it

284.81 --> 292.61
but just this big white haze up there

289.039 --> 296.09
and the Sun is not you see now it's

292.61 --> 302.96000000000004
coming through a little but still it's

296.09 --> 305.539
not it's not fully still kind of nice

302.96 --> 308.51
though but yeah not enough not warm

305.539 --> 313.88
enough for me to take off the shirt

308.51 --> 316.63
again it's nice with it so how are you

313.88 --> 316.63
all doing

318.099 --> 326.539
hmm was here first an ace MacLeod

322.84 --> 335.169
togarmah co-brand M good to see you

326.539 --> 335.169
I see if Chico righteous force

335.68 --> 349.57
matrix media pure medicine and Jason

342.71 --> 349.57
McCormack yeah good to see you

349.91 --> 352.97
[Music]

354.97 --> 361.06
well I have to be I have to take it slow

358.09 --> 364.5
with the coffee or you know what maybe I

361.06 --> 364.5
just need another hit of this

371.689 --> 377.21000000000004
it's just just dirt

393.29 --> 396.49
oh dear

396.73 --> 399.45000000000005
okay

399.509 --> 405.99
I hope to hear the operation yeah I hope

402.509 --> 409.009
the operation went without complications

405.99 --> 409.009
there's your Chico

423.7 --> 432.07
so yeah some weird stuff going on

433.9 --> 440.65999999999997
apparently I haven't actually checked it

437.06 --> 441.83
out it was all bit late for me I went to

440.66 --> 444.91
bed pretty early again

441.83 --> 448.94
but apparently Randy had another

444.91 --> 453.83000000000004
roundtable thingy and I got a message

448.94 --> 456.29
from from Rasta Hat

453.83 --> 460.33
of course it's always on top of these

456.29 --> 470.47
things that apparently Randy did a a

460.33 --> 477.5
Savannah hit piece on me just like when

470.47 --> 480.74
was it Eric Dubay and an Owen Benjamin

477.5 --> 483.62
were supposed to be having an interview

480.74 --> 486.19
and then on Benjamin walked out because

483.62 --> 488.84000000000003
it just didn't feel right to him and a

486.19 --> 493.37
network today I got really pissy as well

488.84 --> 495.91999999999996
and so he did like a response piece clip

493.37 --> 500.68
by clip so that is just classic Sivan

495.92 --> 504.73
yay so I don't know what it was about

500.68 --> 508.52
I'd love to be informed about it but I I

504.73 --> 513.04
I think I'd get nauseated literally

508.52 --> 513.04
seeing that it's because of Randy

518.949 --> 527.149
also there is some how do you say I am

523.61 --> 529.22
pondering on the situation like what is

527.149 --> 531.649
going on what is Randy doing why is he

529.22 --> 537.889
doing this what is he really responding

531.649 --> 542.87
to what did I do besides being very

537.889 --> 553.55
blunt and direct and not very careful on

542.87 --> 556.809
purpose so I think that that I shouldn't

553.55 --> 556.809
do that you know because

567.69 --> 573.0
just at this point everything I'm gonna

571.02 --> 574.89
be talking about towards rent Lee is

573.0 --> 579.54
probably just gonna make everything

574.89 --> 583.92
worse and I don't really see the sense

579.54 --> 586.26
of it on the long run you know the whole

583.92 --> 591.24
issue with him that I have is basically

586.26 --> 595.3199999999999
his his approach like a business

591.24 --> 596.22
decision to deviate and to turn into a

595.32 --> 601.5200000000001
Savannah

596.22 --> 604.6800000000001
and I just I can't handle that that's

601.52 --> 607.86
it's a small step to make one could

604.68 --> 610.2199999999999
argue and rant he probably argues and he

607.86 --> 613.14
will probably just openly defend it

610.22 --> 615.27
right if I even if I confronted him with

613.14 --> 620.64
it I wouldn't be surprised if you would

615.27 --> 626.42
but I can't handle that [ __ ] you know

620.64 --> 626.42
for me it is all about not doing that

633.1 --> 644.8000000000001
Oh God presentational well maybe I could

642.19 --> 649.4100000000001
do a presentation on the psychology of

644.8 --> 652.75
social media and the Sevigny complex I

649.41 --> 654.75
think I could write as a small piece on

652.75 --> 662.29
that that would be probably quite

654.75 --> 665.71
interesting but no look I could do a lot

662.29 --> 672.04
on Randy's but I just don't feel like it

665.71 --> 677.14
anymore because for me to cooperate with

672.04 --> 680.9699999999999
somebody and to be part I have to there

677.14 --> 684.6999999999999
has to be a certain connection and Jose

680.97 --> 687.97
despite the betrayal early on has really

684.7 --> 691.0600000000001
taken me series I feel despite his

687.97 --> 696.51
personal attitude despite his choices

691.06 --> 699.52
and basically gave me recognition for my

696.51 --> 701.95
for my issue for the concern that I had

699.52 --> 704.3199999999999
and at that we have found a new

701.95 --> 709.0
understanding with a bit of a bridge in

704.32 --> 712.96
between but at least at least he took it

709.0 --> 717.91
serious and there's a bridge now I've

712.96 --> 720.4300000000001
been I'd say like cooperating with Randy

717.91 --> 723.6999999999999
and working together on this platform

720.43 --> 727.0899999999999
seeing him as one of the guys giving him

723.7 --> 729.73
praise where he deserves it you know and

727.09 --> 732.61
I still will do that despite everything

729.73 --> 734.59
that he does now because I am NOT Asaph

732.61 --> 739.45
on yet I will give credit where credit

734.59 --> 744.1600000000001
is due and I will always do that even if

739.45 --> 747.33
he became well like worse and I did I

744.16 --> 747.3299999999999
wouldn't recommend it

750.05 --> 757.29
but I don't like where grantees attitude

755.07 --> 762.6
has gone and just the way he now

757.29 --> 767.5999999999999
presents himself it is it's not good it

762.6 --> 767.6
doesn't feel good I miss the old Randy

781.01 --> 788.0889999999999
but who knows maybe that ranty was

784.699 --> 792.17
actually the fake grantee and now here

788.089 --> 797.0290000000001
I'm doing it can't help it but that's it

792.17 --> 802.25
maybe ranty was putting an act together

797.029 --> 804.74
in his in his attitude and his code of

802.25 --> 807.709
conduct because he thought that would

804.74 --> 811.79
fit better like there was a need for

807.709 --> 814.16
bros so he worked with that but maybe

811.79 --> 818.75
that's not really him maybe this is

814.16 --> 821.36
really the way he is and he needed to be

818.75 --> 826.73
able to express that thing that is a

821.36 --> 828.589
part of him that so maybe see that that

826.73 --> 830.87
brings a whole new luck maybe he needed

828.589 --> 835.6700000000001
the breathing room to be more like

830.87 --> 838.67
himself this is about Randy I'm talking

835.67 --> 845.06
about Randy and what's going on what

838.67 --> 851.99
he's doing how he's changed so I yeah I

845.06 --> 857.8389999999999
keep wondering and at this point

851.99 --> 861.62
to be fair I I don't see any use in

857.839 --> 865.639
asking Randy about these things because

861.62 --> 872.05
I don't feel that he like he I don't

865.639 --> 872.05
think he even accepts it that I do this

872.62 --> 878.0600000000001
that I point straight through people's

875.389 --> 880.25
image that they try to put out for

878.06 --> 883.13
whatever reason even if it is supposed

880.25 --> 885.86
to be a joke that's why even early on on

883.13 --> 892.22
the debates when the guys would set up

885.86 --> 895.01
like a joke or an act I just sometimes

892.22 --> 899.2900000000001
wouldn't do it because it just feels

895.01 --> 899.29
wrong unnecessary

905.99 --> 913.63
yes random that that's that's what I

908.63 --> 916.58
think as well and from that perspective

913.63 --> 920.45
what I did and they even like calling

916.58 --> 922.25
him a fact suddenly gets a whole new way

920.45 --> 926.0300000000001
of looking because I was just basically

922.25 --> 928.13
telling him look stop doing this where

926.03 --> 937.37
you're going is wrong go back but if

928.13 --> 940.84
this is actually him well then well then

937.37 --> 940.84
it's just really not gonna work

945.55 --> 951.49
and I then I don't want to also keep on

949.57 --> 954.61
attacking him over him you know yeah

951.49 --> 958.03
it's useless to attack people over the

954.61 --> 963.85
way they are if that's really what

958.03 --> 967.2099999999999
they're doing so I'm just gonna let it

963.85 --> 969.76
be what it is and let ranty do his thing

967.21 --> 975.22
and I'm gonna be doing my own thing as I

969.76 --> 979.45
have and well if Randy feels more knee

975.22 --> 981.9100000000001
to poopoo on me and disgraced me for how

979.45 --> 987.0400000000001
I don't have a paying job and I beg for

981.91 --> 990.0699999999999
money supposedly and I'm just theorizing

987.04 --> 992.65
and fantasizing if you'd like to

990.07 --> 996.37
approach it that way in that derogatory

992.65 --> 1002.9
term well if he feels the need to do

996.37 --> 1006.15
that like a [ __ ] cry out over me and

1002.9 --> 1009.87
declare yeah you know what that is well

1006.15 --> 1013.65
then he's just gonna have to do it but I

1009.87 --> 1022.64
am NOT I am NOT even threatened by it

1013.65 --> 1025.86
because of because I know who he is and

1022.64 --> 1027.66
I'm not so much embarrassed for myself

1025.86 --> 1030.05
because I'm very honest and open about

1027.66 --> 1033.39
all these things that he's trying to

1030.05 --> 1035.9099999999999
attack me with no I'm just really

1033.39 --> 1040.45
embarrassed that he would let himself do

1035.91 --> 1043.72
this so

1040.45 --> 1043.72
that's it

1053.01 --> 1060.23
well instead check oh it really all

1055.679 --> 1064.8300000000002
depends it's just that to have a job and

1060.23 --> 1067.559
and really take it and keep it for

1064.83 --> 1070.26
somebody in my position I pretty much

1067.559 --> 1075.809
have to abandon everything else and with

1070.26 --> 1080.97
that I mean everything else it would be

1075.809 --> 1083.01
I would be forced if I just like

1080.97 --> 1085.23
otherwise they just eject me after a

1083.01 --> 1090.6
month but if I wanted to go for it and

1085.23 --> 1093.179
really bite in like take control use all

1090.6 --> 1095.9399999999998
the energy I have to just get a grip on

1093.179 --> 1099.24
everyone and and even play all the

1095.94 --> 1101.97
sneaky shitty games manipulating just to

1099.24 --> 1103.59
make sure that I am solid there to

1101.97 --> 1108.99
ground myself there it's gonna take up

1103.59 --> 1114.1689999999999
everything all my energy and my will so

1108.99 --> 1119.3700000000001
that's why I don't really look forward

1114.169 --> 1121.7700000000002
being forced in such a situation because

1119.37 --> 1124.01
I'd rather much rather do this it's much

1121.77 --> 1127.32
more intellectually stimulating and

1124.01 --> 1131.25
socially gratifying and it feels

1127.32 --> 1133.8899999999999
productive on the long run well I have

1131.25 --> 1137.16
worked for companies like for example

1133.89 --> 1140.64
the last real paying job I had for a

1137.16 --> 1144.48
month in a call center it literally felt

1140.64 --> 1148.1100000000001
like I was wasting time and energy just

1144.48 --> 1151.02
to keep numbers rolling and it wasn't

1148.11 --> 1155.33
like that was the crazy thing about it

1151.02 --> 1157.799
and I don't want to criticize

1155.33 --> 1159.84
specifically the place where I was

1157.799 --> 1161.58
having my job because I thought that

1159.84 --> 1164.79
well my colleagues and even the

1161.58 --> 1167.73
management was pretty decent they did

1164.79 --> 1171.03
they weren't like total dicks or

1167.73 --> 1173.99
anything absolutely not but just the way

1171.03 --> 1178.8899999999999
the management liked the way the company

1173.99 --> 1181.26
was set up like what you had to do while

1178.89 --> 1183.5700000000002
looking at what did what it's supposed

1181.26 --> 1187.64
to be doing look what what we were doing

1183.57 --> 1191.34
is selling or offering people

1187.64 --> 1193.8300000000002
cheap newspapers and try to get them to

1191.34 --> 1195.78
like we give you a big discount or you

1193.83 --> 1198.8899999999999
have it for free will you take it and

1195.78 --> 1201.87
then they'll get the hassle of it and

1198.89 --> 1204.45
but it's basically drawing in clientele

1201.87 --> 1207.6589999999999
so how does that really work in the real

1204.45 --> 1210.0
world if you take it seriously well you

1207.659 --> 1212.49
want to bind your clientele and be nice

1210.0 --> 1215.09
to them and leave a good impression and

1212.49 --> 1218.46
you want to especially adapt your

1215.09 --> 1221.22
communications to them in order for that

1218.46 --> 1225.75
to be achieved but what we were forced

1221.22 --> 1227.64
to do was hurry hurry hurry and when you

1225.75 --> 1233.46
couldn't find a solution quick enough

1227.64 --> 1236.789
just ignore it drop it and let somebody

1233.46 --> 1239.64
else deal with it and that it and there

1236.789 --> 1242.34
were so many people that were so pissed

1239.64 --> 1249.21
off it was ridiculous

1242.34 --> 1255.09
and that's the [ __ ] that's going on in

1249.21 --> 1258.8700000000001
the working world I think that is a

1255.09 --> 1263.97
pretty typical scenario for what a lot

1258.87 --> 1265.7399999999998
of jobs are like it's it's a job in a

1263.97 --> 1268.83
company that's supposed to be doing

1265.74 --> 1273.6
something but because of efficiency and

1268.83 --> 1279.99
probe just the program it becomes quite

1273.6 --> 1282.99
the opposite and instead of binding

1279.99 --> 1289.14
friendly clientele they become more like

1282.99 --> 1292.53
a jeté ssin pokers and probably through

1289.14 --> 1294.8300000000002
weird [ __ ] are using just this being a

1292.53 --> 1297.59
nuisance to certain people to keep them

1294.83 --> 1301.289
even negatively in their mind and

1297.59 --> 1304.289
somehow this apparently has a long-term

1301.289 --> 1306.87
effect that still gives them some yield

1304.289 --> 1310.11
otherwise why would they program these

1306.87 --> 1312.51
companies to to function like this but

1310.11 --> 1314.6999999999998
it's a total miserable setup because if

1312.51 --> 1316.35
you just want to genuinely perform the

1314.7 --> 1318.559
function that the company is supposed to

1316.35 --> 1320.02
do you will run into obstacles

1318.559 --> 1323.74
constantly you

1320.02 --> 1331.66
at scoffed at you'll get demoted that's

1323.74 --> 1336.88
really that what the hell you know yeah

1331.66 --> 1339.8500000000001
I met much rather just do this be here

1336.88 --> 1342.0400000000002
in a specific time in place keep my

1339.85 --> 1345.0
composure as much as possible treat

1342.04 --> 1347.8899999999999
subjects explain things use my skills

1345.0 --> 1352.66
for people that come here specifically

1347.89 --> 1357.19
for that and then well some people that

1352.66 --> 1359.6200000000001
may may just understand how yeah what

1357.19 --> 1363.8500000000001
I'm doing will help me financially a

1359.62 --> 1368.6799999999998
little so so it can keep going and I

1363.85 --> 1370.6899999999998
much prefer that setup because it's all

1368.68 --> 1373.03
voluntary I'm doing this voluntary

1370.69 --> 1377.5
people that help me do this voluntary

1373.03 --> 1382.78
and if it doesn't work what I'm doing if

1377.5 --> 1386.17
I'm not providing in the right way then

1382.78 --> 1388.36
it stops if I break something if I do

1386.17 --> 1390.91
something really stupid or if I break my

1388.36 --> 1394.57
principles like that that's obvious so

1390.91 --> 1397.3600000000001
part of my core of what I'm doing is

1394.57 --> 1401.3799999999999
persistency and sticking to the path

1397.36 --> 1403.33
really seriously and people that

1401.38 --> 1405.67
wouldn't be used to that they'd see it

1403.33 --> 1408.72
as like oh my god what are you doing

1405.67 --> 1413.38
that's must be so terrible you have to

1408.72 --> 1415.33
wave all these seductions off constantly

1413.38 --> 1418.5100000000002
everywhere oh look what you could do

1415.33 --> 1421.3899999999999
this to do it quicker well I'm so used

1418.51 --> 1427.26
to doing that already I've been training

1421.39 --> 1430.24
myself to reject things originally

1427.26 --> 1432.64
guided by principles that were not so

1430.24 --> 1436.06
well thought out but still intuitive and

1432.64 --> 1439.6000000000001
now it's turned out that despite my mind

1436.06 --> 1443.04
was in an illusion position my intuition

1439.6 --> 1446.98
was still giving me proper signals and

1443.04 --> 1449.98
now I understand what was really going

1446.98 --> 1453.33
on and now I try to use this more

1449.98 --> 1455.79
sensible mental approach

1453.33 --> 1460.29
and just do things right and keep doing

1455.79 --> 1462.12
it and not not even be seduced so more

1460.29 --> 1466.29
about all oh but you could do this you

1462.12 --> 1473.28
could do that if you just stop caring

1466.29 --> 1478.43
about this or that because not stopping

1473.28 --> 1482.46
caring about things is a constant reward

1478.43 --> 1485.67
it allows you to tap into the divine

1482.46 --> 1488.64
energy and by that means by upholding

1485.67 --> 1493.71
that you resonate with the Christ energy

1488.64 --> 1497.5800000000002
you could say and the universe the the

1493.71 --> 1499.71
world God's creation will reflect it

1497.58 --> 1503.1899999999998
back on you and will reward you and

1499.71 --> 1507.39
that's something that if you didn't know

1503.19 --> 1510.06
that if you had kept focus on the

1507.39 --> 1515.94
seductions every time for you to deviate

1510.06 --> 1518.94
then you'd never even feel it maybe by

1515.94 --> 1520.26
chance at some point but you wouldn't

1518.94 --> 1522.1200000000001
really wreck it you would see it as wow

1520.26 --> 1523.74
what is good this is special but you

1522.12 --> 1525.54
wouldn't really understand it you

1523.74 --> 1529.14
wouldn't be able to really see where

1525.54 --> 1531.03
it's coming from if you bypass the face

1529.14 --> 1535.89
where everything is a seduction to you

1531.03 --> 1538.77
to just to just take that easy step or

1535.89 --> 1544.89
take good deal and that could be a lot

1538.77 --> 1551.16
of different things then eventually it

1544.89 --> 1556.4
falls off like an old rag and everything

1551.16 --> 1556.4
is just much clearer

1558.649 --> 1561.799
all right

1566.28 --> 1569.28
anyway

1569.7 --> 1572.819
[Music]

1579.419 --> 1583.47
Luna ena Lottie

1587.789 --> 1590.6589999999999
heute

1605.66 --> 1612.51
her right ace MacLeod got it when I was

1609.69 --> 1614.55
talking about take the yeah sell drugs

1612.51 --> 1621.98
if you want a lot of money

1614.55 --> 1621.98
Greg yeah that's just brilliant

1627.29 --> 1632.99
and and to be fair and this is kind of a

1629.929 --> 1636.13
confession now it's not too bad but I

1632.99 --> 1641.929
didn't like sell drugs but when I was

1636.13 --> 1644.0590000000002
like 18 and after when getting weed for

1641.929 --> 1648.71
me was basically legally possible

1644.059 --> 1652.21
I did like abused that power which was

1648.71 --> 1655.52
pretty fresh back then it was like

1652.21 --> 1657.919
wasn't it was pretty unique to the

1655.52 --> 1662.21
Netherlands too and I did kind of use

1657.919 --> 1665.72
that to be almost like a drug dealer but

1662.21 --> 1671.02
I'd rather than just give it or do trade

1665.72 --> 1671.02
or not really abuse it

1677.01 --> 1688.35
I did like it when women got all frolic

1680.22 --> 1690.95
II with it but anyway that that was the

1688.35 --> 1690.9499999999998
old times

1696.74 --> 1700.52
and a woman to you

1714.24 --> 1721.35
all right yeah ace but look the thing is

1717.84 --> 1724.32
I never like wind on expeditions like

1721.35 --> 1727.05
that like I never it's just always per

1724.32 --> 1729.1499999999999
opportunity like I was a smoker

1727.05 --> 1732.87
I wouldn't pretty much give a [ __ ] about

1729.15 --> 1738.41
anything I was very defiant and I just

1732.87 --> 1738.4099999999999
have weaved with me so that's what I did

1749.46 --> 1756.55
but yeah that's that's D that's like

1752.43 --> 1776.0700000000002
alone that like right after school days

1756.55 --> 1776.07
and during school days - is it CGI ranty

1776.1 --> 1779.6999999999998
right can be

1784.45 --> 1791.6490000000001
it has its good moments and it's bad

1787.119 --> 1796.6589999999999
moments and the trick is to recognize it

1791.649 --> 1802.09
what phase you're at and then yeah turn

1796.659 --> 1810.45
it down or quit for a while

1802.09 --> 1816.34
ooh Wow CJ I ran that is that's nasty

1810.45 --> 1818.3500000000001
well we can if you are it all depends on

1816.34 --> 1818.9189999999999
your state of mind if you're not calm

1818.35 --> 1823.799
down

1818.919 --> 1827.0800000000002
then cannabis can definitely make

1823.799 --> 1830.2
agitations and things worse it's an

1827.08 --> 1832.889
amplifier pretty universally it's just

1830.2 --> 1832.8890000000001
an amplifier

1839.179 --> 1845.779
and there's people that just don't like

1842.149 --> 1848.809
it at all my brother being one of them I

1845.779 --> 1852.94
think he tried it once never tried it

1848.809 --> 1852.94
again and he said just he hated it

1859.08 --> 1866.279
alright that's interesting though CGI

1862.019 --> 1869.7
look at the anxiety part that is that is

1866.279 --> 1873.119
kind of normal most of my life when I

1869.7 --> 1876.8400000000001
smoke I would get the first 15 minutes I

1873.119 --> 1880.86
would get some anxiety especially like

1876.84 --> 1882.9599999999998
when I really don't smoke carefully when

1880.86 --> 1885.9289999999999
I'm really in a smoking mood it always

1882.96 --> 1888.779
happens at first it's like a poisoning

1885.929 --> 1891.299
reaction from your body and you get like

1888.779 --> 1893.789
slight anxiety and if you go with that

1891.299 --> 1900.48
yeah you go totally paranoid that's not

1893.789 --> 1903.299
good but it goes away now if it doesn't

1900.48 --> 1909.6490000000001
go away then you got a problem then you

1903.299 --> 1909.649
got a real a bad reaction or a bad trip

1911.179 --> 1914.5800000000002
rights unicorn laser eyes that's

1914.009 --> 1918.269
hilarious

1914.58 --> 1920.46
thank you for the $5 super chat donation

1918.269 --> 1922.999
let's keep our win and employed hit the

1920.46 --> 1922.999
super chat

1938.05 --> 1945.6299999999999
why do I look like a crime lord Lottie

1941.37 --> 1945.6299999999999
you can be such a troll Oh

1981.34 --> 1983.999
right

2002.8 --> 2012.56
mmm-hmm right weird I'd be interested to

2009.98 --> 2015.5
see if people got videos of me in the

2012.56 --> 2018.3799999999999
past though it would be really freaky to

2015.5 --> 2022.45
see myself from then again I I think I

2018.38 --> 2025.94
did get him some cameras from people but

2022.45 --> 2033.38
that would just be random people just

2025.94 --> 2035.1200000000001
shooting with their phones and [ __ ] man

2033.38 --> 2037.96
it would be so surreal to see myself

2035.12 --> 2037.9599999999998
from them

2042.2 --> 2050.079
mock shots no I have no criminal record

2046.94 --> 2050.079
thank God

2061.35 --> 2069.5099999999998
yeah now as a especially as a teenager

2066.22 --> 2078.8199999999997
and preteen I was a troublemaker oh yeah

2069.51 --> 2080.5600000000004
but I was always very say I don't know

2078.82 --> 2081.55
there's some people that would be like

2080.56 --> 2084.22
oh yeah

2081.55 --> 2087.04
I am a criminal ooh that is so cool I

2084.22 --> 2089.8599999999997
like the whole that weird

2087.04 --> 2092.56
issue that came from when hip-hop got

2089.86 --> 2094.48
totally corrupted freakin gangsta rap

2092.56 --> 2098.11
people started to be proud of that [ __ ]

2094.48 --> 2101.02
I always like I was more a sneaky guy I

2098.11 --> 2104.35
was always a troublemaker but I I just I

2101.02 --> 2107.85
don't you you won't catch me doing that

2104.35 --> 2112.42
and I'm not doing that anymore anyway so

2107.85 --> 2114.93
no I would never be like bragging that I

2112.42 --> 2117.67
did bad [ __ ]

2114.93 --> 2126.3399999999997
and every time I did I always felt like

2117.67 --> 2128.4900000000002
a total dick so afterwards what's going

2126.34 --> 2128.4900000000002
on

2130.64 --> 2136.66
what the [ __ ] sicko

2147.26 --> 2152.5400000000004
because they are psycho trolls thank you

2150.02 --> 2157.73
over Merkel for catching that and thank

2152.54 --> 2159.35
you for paying attention I I don't pay

2157.73 --> 2162.02
as much attention as I probably should

2159.35 --> 2166.06
but then again if I would then the

2162.02 --> 2166.06
trolls would just take more attention

2172.84 --> 2182.65
now now sir check out the issue is there

2178.4 --> 2188.39
is no beyond trolling the issue is that

2182.65 --> 2192.9100000000003
that's the real trolling but when we

2188.39 --> 2195.7999999999997
look we have a community of people that

2192.91 --> 2199.3689999999997
were potentially trolls that are kind of

2195.8 --> 2201.8300000000004
like more mild troll but like slightly

2199.369 --> 2207.1000000000004
better behaved troll that'll still poke

2201.83 --> 2207.1
sticks but they're not gonna poke a

2207.88 --> 2215.38
spear in you or anything I just poke you

2210.74 --> 2215.3799999999997
with sticks and that's the difference

2222.65 --> 2226.779
what the hell alone a Yuna

2235.55 --> 2243.04
what okay but Jesus dude

2247.07 --> 2255.8
okay so yay claim video blah blah blah

2253.64 --> 2258.68
this is looking really bad for you lone

2255.8 --> 2265.73
hyena so is he going to be arrested then

2258.68 --> 2268.5699999999997
soon because if that's true he would so

2265.73 --> 2268.57
what's going on

2272.5 --> 2284.51
no I'd rather you as somebody that has a

2279.35 --> 2288.74
wrench in my chat approach this a little

2284.51 --> 2292.28
bit more seriously so if that is real

2288.74 --> 2295.1299999999997
then where did it come from where where

2292.28 --> 2301.4900000000002
did you even find that [ __ ] who made it

2295.13 --> 2305.32
because it smells like a giant SIA

2301.49 --> 2305.3199999999997
basically it's ridiculous

2310.01 --> 2315.5600000000004
yeah okay yeah sure Ilona inna sure

2313.83 --> 2318.06
you're being honest with you that

2315.56 --> 2323.73
doesn't exclude you from being very

2318.06 --> 2327.09
stupid about it though so yeah if that's

2323.73 --> 2332.85
real there's some consequences so have

2327.09 --> 2336.54
you tested it have you sourced it like

2332.85 --> 2340.35
that kind of remark is not some just um

2336.54 --> 2344.12
oh look somebody did something silly on

2340.35 --> 2344.12
camera okay dude

2349.74 --> 2354.839
oh by the way thank you again Amanda

2351.599 --> 2356.73

visual trickery because if it wasn't

2560.2 --> 2565.6299999999997
hoax at this point but don't need proof

2563.349 --> 2567.4300000000003
of him being arrested some kind of

2565.63 --> 2571.599
official confirmation that they're

2567.43 --> 2574.18
actually that they had a reports an

2571.599 --> 2577.54
official report with the material and

2574.18 --> 2581.23
that they're looking into it that

2577.54 --> 2585.04
already be something somewhat of proof

2581.23 --> 2588.64
that at least it is yeah

2585.04 --> 2590.47
they're taking the steps for if it was

2588.64 --> 2594.73
real okay

2590.47 --> 2597.6299999999997
and if it was a hoax then while the

2594.73 --> 2597.63
police will tell you

2603.96 --> 2610.68
yeah no but look pumpkin there is just

2609.12 --> 2616.0499999999997

2616.05 --> 2622.59
especially now this is this is the new

2619.68 --> 2624.7799999999997
player zone if you if you get serious

2622.59 --> 2628.38
with that kind of level of stuff and

2624.78 --> 2630.6000000000004
criminality that's just insane you can't

2628.38 --> 2633.36
just say oh look I cut oh yeah sorry

2630.6 --> 2634.7999999999997

2633.36 --> 2638.6400000000003
somebody gonna go down

2634.8 --> 2640.53
it's a huge accusation to just casually

2638.64 --> 2644.0299999999997
say it and oh yeah

2640.53 --> 2644.03
that is insane

2652.67 --> 2660.38
if I had a clue about that I'd not I'd

2657.47 --> 2663.0789999999997
be saying wow guys something incredible

2660.38 --> 2666.339
happened this guy might be going to jail

2663.079 --> 2670.3390000000004
they're filing their police report now

2666.339 --> 2672.859
who knows me I hope it's a PSYOP or some

2670.339 --> 2674.69
kind of troll stunt that's what I would

2672.859 --> 2677.21
do if I'd be sharing I wouldn't be

2674.69 --> 2681.44
saying oh yeah yeah oh yeah you was

2677.21 --> 2687.829
caught on table that that's again stupid

2681.44 --> 2690.16
stupid serve on your behavior dumb don't

2687.829 --> 2690.1600000000003
do that

2706.23 --> 2712.349
yeah and I'll tell you look this kind of

2710.099 --> 2718.05
[ __ ] this is on YouTube in the internet

2712.349 --> 2721.02
right or if if somebody say in social

2718.05 --> 2725.099
media whatever the runo's Facebook

2721.02 --> 2727.71
whatever [ __ ] some check text program

2725.099 --> 2730.79
would be saying that kind of stuff in a

2727.71 --> 2736.349
chat somewhere here in the Netherlands

2730.79 --> 2742.47
they probably get arrested because of

2736.349 --> 2745.76
serious slander like it could be okay so

2742.47 --> 2745.7599999999998
that's yeah

2756.19 --> 2761.92
I can't believe that I'm I need to

2759.34 --> 2763.81
explain this to somebody with a wrench I

2761.92 --> 2766.9
think I gave you the wrench because

2763.81 --> 2768.61
because you gave me a super chat

2766.9 --> 2773.59
donation the other day and you have been

2768.61 --> 2777.61
cool but this is just stupid man and who

2773.59 --> 2780.58
knows maybe maybe it is something but

2777.61 --> 2784.6800000000003
you shouldn't just be dumping it in a

2780.58 --> 2790.21
chat like oh it's all done deal it's

2784.68 --> 2792.46
absolutely absurd so yeah we'll figure

2790.21 --> 2796.53
it out it's probably a stupid hoax and

2792.46 --> 2796.53
now I wasted 15 minutes on this

2819.09 --> 2824.36
yeah

2820.85 --> 2827.06
but it's look before you engage in

2824.36 --> 2833.15
spreading any kind of evidence or video

2827.06 --> 2838.84
would be good to source it and to see if

2833.15 --> 2838.84
it's actually real and not some crazy

2838.99 --> 2843.52
fabrication in some way

2857.69 --> 2869.039
all right hyena just posted in master be

2861.539 --> 2872.63
okay I don't want it in my chats but

2869.039 --> 2875.5490000000004
look okay if that's the case well yeah

2872.63 --> 2885.089
guess we won't be seeing as McLeod for

2875.549 --> 2889.14
much longer than well John Watson I do

2885.089 --> 2892.349
remember is McLeod for being the the

2889.14 --> 2895.14
ultimate flat earth chat first er that's

2892.349 --> 2899.51
usually what he did also talked about

2895.14 --> 2907.0099999999998
ayahuasca a lot and just taking drugs

2899.51 --> 2907.01
that's what I remember and that's it

2916.69 --> 2922.06
Hey

2918.42 --> 2924.3

2922.06 --> 2924.2999999999997

3040.979 --> 3048.529

3073.55 --> 3076.3300000000004
all right

3078.569 --> 3089.819

3143.19 --> 3150.0
yeah I heard you the first time David

3145.8 --> 3152.57
Blackson you don't have to copy paste

3150.0 --> 3152.57
that

3164.19 --> 3167.19
hmm

3180.48 --> 3183.349

3188.99 --> 3201.0499999999997
another debate so I will be joining that

3197.75 --> 3205.01
after this and I think I'm just about to

3201.05 --> 3212.36
round out the show I guess pretty cut

3205.01 --> 3214.76
off trying thinking with that crazy dark

3212.36 --> 3224.21
use Asian subject whatever it may turn

3214.76 --> 3230.8900000000003
out to be yeah so stay safe stay flat

3224.21 --> 3230.89
indeed yeah

3237.79 --> 3247.21
indeed so yeah we'll try again tomorrow

3244.63 --> 3249.73
and of course I am gonna join the Flat

3247.21 --> 3254.92
Earth debate so thanks everyone for

3249.73 --> 3256.98
coming I hope you liked the majority of

3254.92 --> 3260.92
the show and if you did then please

3256.98 --> 3262.33
don't forget to up fold it and also if

3260.92 --> 3263.92
you haven't already subscribed to my

3262.33 --> 3265.12
channel and hit the bell notification so

3263.92 --> 3267.04
you know when I'm going live which is

3265.12 --> 3274.66
normally 2:00 p.m. and so damn time

3267.04 --> 3278.22
every day hmm it's weird though by the

3274.66 --> 3281.7999999999997
way sorry for interrupting the outro but

3278.22 --> 3285.7
yeah my not that it really matters too

3281.8 --> 3287.8
much for me I've been keeping track of

3285.7 --> 3293.2
the subscribers and so have you guys and

3287.8 --> 3294.9100000000003
I get a lot of chat activity and decent

3293.2 --> 3296.7999999999997
amount of people watching like even now

3294.91 --> 3299.47
64 is not bad at all

3296.8 --> 3303.61
it's pretty good average yet my

3299.47 --> 3305.5
subscriber amount is just it keeps on

3303.61 --> 3309.03
doing that same thing just going back

3305.5 --> 3315.94
and forth and it's been sitting right

3309.03 --> 3319.2900000000004
below the 144 for months for at least a

3315.94 --> 3321.85
month maybe two it's just weird

3319.29 --> 3325.99
well everything all the other channels

3321.85 --> 3331.63
like Jose and Randy and yeah they seem

3325.99 --> 3335.29
to now be grown really rapidly could it

3331.63 --> 3341.02
be because they tapped into the into the

3335.29 --> 3343.33
you know what frequency so now the the

3341.02 --> 3347.62
algorithm has opened its door to them

3343.33 --> 3349.96
maybe that's it but I still hope that I

3347.62 --> 3351.79
do get new subscribers and although it's

3349.96 --> 3353.7400000000002
mostly important to be that there's

3351.79 --> 3356.29
people actually paying attention and

3353.74 --> 3359.29
learning that's what I really prioritize

3356.29 --> 3361.0
here it would be nice to see the channel

3359.29 --> 3367.54
growing in subscribers as well although

3361.0 --> 3370.63
at this point it could all be giant it

3367.54 --> 3372.25
could all be fake like Mike's subscribe

3370.63 --> 3375.549
could potentially be much higher than

3372.25 --> 3378.7
its showing I don't know I just don't

3375.549 --> 3381.49
know you can't tell anymore at this

3378.7 --> 3383.9199999999996
point you just can't tell can manipulate

3381.49 --> 3387.16
you openly and they can manipulate you

3383.92 --> 3391.049
secretly and I'm probably not the most

3387.16 --> 3394.8689999999997
beloved character in YouTube for Google

3391.049 --> 3401.049
employees considering my opinions in

3394.869 --> 3403.329
certain things yeah anyway did our

3401.049 --> 3405.069
winning bear that's my other account

3403.329 --> 3410.079
originally our winning gravity which is

3405.069 --> 3411.67

3410.079 --> 3413.44

3411.67 --> 3417.1800000000003
use that to comment on our own Benjamin

3413.44 --> 3421.4500000000003
