93.6 --> 100.39999999999999
experienced anything like this before

96.96 --> 102.55999999999999
it's that i'm such a trust on yourself

100.4 --> 104.399
it'll be okay guy otherwise i would have

102.56 --> 108.24000000000001
probably been

104.399 --> 108.24
brought to the hospital at some point

109.759 --> 117.04
right they did ask me but i

112.88 --> 117.759
am okay hope to see some people here

117.04 --> 122.24000000000001
it's

117.759 --> 122.24
i missed missed you guys

122.88 --> 128.959
but uh yeah saturday night

125.92 --> 132.08
that's a great show yeah surprise

128.959 --> 132.08
surprise no notes

132.44 --> 137.12
[Music]

133.92 --> 141.11999999999998
saturday night the ball busters and

137.12 --> 143.92000000000002
i was very very stupid

141.12 --> 144.8
because i drank way too much for my own

143.92 --> 147.67999999999998
good and even

144.8 --> 151.76000000000002
thinking about it just a trace of

147.68 --> 151.76000000000002
thought about it already nauseates me

152.4 --> 161.36
so yeah yesterday

156.16 --> 165.76
i literally did nothing i did not go out

161.36 --> 171.04000000000002
i did not eat anything i was just

165.76 --> 173.92
drinking yeah and throwing up

171.04 --> 173.92
today however

174.08 --> 178.0
i thought it would be completely over

179.92 --> 184.79999999999998
and though it's not as bad i haven't

181.92 --> 189.51899999999998
literally thrown up anything yet

184.8 --> 189.519
it's still very feeble

192.319 --> 201.35999999999999
and yeah my organs have been pretty much

196.4 --> 201.36
torn apart yesterday

203.04 --> 208.07999999999998
so you can still hear it in my voice

205.28 --> 208.08
it's [ __ ] up

208.4 --> 211.44
i'm not going to join the flat earth

209.84 --> 213.36
debates

211.44 --> 215.599
because that would be too strainful for

213.36 --> 215.59900000000002
me

215.76 --> 220.48
and hopefully i will be able to tomorrow

218.239 --> 224.64000000000001
again

220.48 --> 228.48
but i don't know i still feel pretty bad

224.64 --> 228.48
i still have my bucket in the room

228.879 --> 241.84
so don't be surprised if i literally

231.84 --> 241.84
turn around all of a sudden

244.08 --> 255.84
yeah the only thing that really seems to

246.08 --> 255.84
work is just sleeping

256.479 --> 263.03999999999996
and literally trying not to stress out

261.12 --> 265.759
thank you good servant for the 99 super

263.04 --> 265.759
chat donation

266.56 --> 272.96
oh [ __ ] it's so annoying because i am

271.28 --> 275.44
kind of hungry but i just can't eat

272.96 --> 275.44
anything

276.08 --> 280.4
it's it's actually yeah

281.199 --> 284.24
very distressing

284.56 --> 297.84
so yeah don't be surprised if i'm gonna

287.44 --> 297.84
round out the show very quickly

298.32 --> 311.84
just saying hello

320.56 --> 325.84
there's no way there's no way that's

322.639 --> 325.84000000000003
possible good servant

331.52 --> 333.75899999999996
just

334.88 --> 339.84
i can barely even drink some mild tea

340.639 --> 347.12
and it was kind of silly enough to eat a

344.639 --> 350.08
a piece of lattice just i thought like

347.12 --> 352.24
this this gotta be do some good right

350.08 --> 354.56
well even that it's basically now

352.24 --> 355.28000000000003
sitting there in my stomach i can feel

354.56 --> 358.72
it and it's

355.28 --> 358.71999999999997
causing me quite a bother

363.6 --> 367.84000000000003
go to the hospital what why

369.36 --> 382.40000000000003
so i can get a new giant bill

380.08 --> 384.639
yeah i really feel like lying down right

382.4 --> 384.63899999999995
now

386.08 --> 395.84
but i'll hold it off

405.759 --> 410.47900000000004
it's i could try to describe it it's

409.68 --> 415.039
just that

410.479 --> 415.039
so much violence yesterday

415.199 --> 418.639
on my stomach i can literally feel that

417.919 --> 421.84
it's

418.639 --> 425.12
now unnaturally shaped

421.84 --> 428.88
it's been like swollen from the

425.12 --> 431.36
stressing so it's just sitting there in

428.88 --> 431.36
the way

431.68 --> 437.84000000000003
yeah sorry sorry for describing all that

444.8 --> 447.36
to just

447.84 --> 451.84
i want to be better

453.52 --> 456.639
it's so terrible

459.199 --> 465.84000000000003
it's just

466.22 --> 469.28900000000004
[Music]

473.36 --> 480.319
it's okay guys maybe i just need to like

477.919 --> 480.31899999999996
share

481.039 --> 485.919
yesterday i was much worse than this can

483.28 --> 485.919
you imagine

488.56 --> 506.16
sometimes i was so stressed out i

492.56 --> 509.44
i couldn't even get up from my bed

506.16 --> 509.44
i'll be all right you know

513.839 --> 520.32
i wasn't completely alone

517.44 --> 520.8800000000001
there were her roommates were kind of

520.32 --> 523.9190000000001
nice

520.88 --> 526.16
and i called my dad

523.919 --> 528.3199999999999
and my healer and helped out some and

526.16 --> 531.12
all that so it's not completely alone

528.32 --> 535.839
it's just that

531.12 --> 535.839
and you feel like this is

546.0 --> 549.839
hope i'll be better soon

550.88 --> 554.88
but at least now you know guys know with

553.6 --> 558.399
it

554.88 --> 558.399
when i don't do a show

561.04 --> 563.8389999999999
it's bad

564.64 --> 570.72
or yeah i will there's something urgent

568.56 --> 572.16
that's done or i will announce it ahead

570.72 --> 575.279
of time

572.16 --> 579.279
but yesterday god

575.279 --> 581.519
the only only nice thing is

579.279 --> 582.43
that like it's really beautiful weather

581.519 --> 585.49
look see

582.43 --> 585.4899999999999
[Music]

586.399 --> 591.6
and some nice sun although yeah even the

589.76 --> 593.4399999999999
heat from the sun is almost a little bit

591.6 --> 596.64
too much at times

593.44 --> 597.839
i think tomorrow it'll it'll absorb a

596.64 --> 605.8389999999999
lot better

597.839 --> 605.839
it's just everything is too much

610.88 --> 615.12
yeah yeah you could call it a hangover

614.16 --> 619.8389999999999
but it's just

615.12 --> 619.839
beyond the hangover you know

620.88 --> 625.279
my stupid problem was is that i drank

624.64 --> 628.8
too much

625.279 --> 631.4399999999999
and i didn't have dinner and i drank way

628.8 --> 634.079
too much for not having dinner it was

631.44 --> 637.7600000000001
chaos here i literally woke up

634.079 --> 640.0
and there was just an uneaten pizza here

637.76 --> 642.0
i don't remember anything that happened

640.0 --> 643.519
all i remember is ball busters was

642.0 --> 647.839
really cool

643.519 --> 647.839
and after that i don't remember anything

653.46 --> 656.5590000000001
[Music]

657.76 --> 663.6
i'm doing good by the way this sounds

659.839 --> 663.6
weird i feel a bit shaky but

666.56 --> 669.68
maybe this is helping

670.079 --> 676.3199999999999
sip some no soda

674.079 --> 676.3199999999999
tea

681.519 --> 685.279
oh thank you that flat fellow

685.36 --> 689.839
199 super chat donation

693.44 --> 698.32
thank you for the food good vibes it it

696.0 --> 700.0
really helps i think

698.32 --> 701.6
it's like yesterday would not have

700.0 --> 704.0
helped too much

701.6 --> 705.12
but today i'm just really freaking

704.0 --> 709.2
feeble

705.12 --> 712.48
and it does help long walks help

709.2 --> 715.6800000000001
well that might be

712.48 --> 719.279
a good idea but i'm too

715.68 --> 721.68
feeble to have a long walk

719.279 --> 721.68
i just

722.72 --> 731.839
i lost a couple of pounds yesterday guys

727.519 --> 731.839
i feel skinny as [ __ ]

739.92 --> 744.8
good servant what the hell are you

742.839 --> 759.839
saying

744.8 --> 759.8389999999999
why are you saying that

765.2 --> 768.639
all right here we go again yeah bad joke

767.92 --> 771.12
indeed

768.639 --> 772.24
you know when it's a bad joke you don't

771.12 --> 774.8
make it

772.24 --> 777.2
you don't do it because it's a bad joke

774.8 --> 779.4399999999999
and it's not funny

777.2 --> 779.44
why

782.72 --> 787.839
i can't get some food down dude i can't

792.0 --> 795.44
i'm lucky enough that i can slowly

794.56 --> 798.3199999999999
absorb

795.44 --> 801.6800000000001
liquids that i can assimilate that's

798.32 --> 805.12
about it

801.68 --> 807.8389999999999
i got some sort of soup thing just for

805.12 --> 807.839
tries but

810.88 --> 816.56
it's just not enough room in there

814.32 --> 819.7600000000001
it takes time and more sleep and more

816.56 --> 819.76
sleep and more sleep

819.839 --> 827.6800000000001
like i have these one or two hour

824.639 --> 832.0
sleep things it's interesting too

827.68 --> 836.16
because i really i figured out something

832.0 --> 840.0
about it especially yesterday it really

836.16 --> 845.04
saved my neck because i managed to

840.0 --> 848.32
figure out how to actively dream

845.04 --> 850.88
how to wakingly dream and then control

848.32 --> 854.0790000000001
that dream to focus on something

850.88 --> 856.959
that is completely without tension to

854.079 --> 859.92
literally have a virtual dream

856.959 --> 862.2399999999999
of sifting around through things only

859.92 --> 864.7199999999999
it's very tough

862.24 --> 865.279
only things that are not controversial

864.72 --> 868.839
not

865.279 --> 872.639
provoking of anything ever so literally

868.839 --> 876.399
like staring at a tree

872.639 --> 880.24
overhearing a silly

876.399 --> 883.519
or yeah a conversation

880.24 --> 886.16
about the weather these things and like

883.519 --> 887.44
focus on that and then i could pull away

886.16 --> 889.519
from the sickness

887.44 --> 892.0
which was literally present at the same

889.519 --> 895.279
time that i was trying to sleep

892.0 --> 899.839
and that worked out so well that i could

895.279 --> 902.0
sleep until it yeah the nausea

899.839 --> 903.1990000000001
died down enough that i could more

902.0 --> 907.04
easily do that

903.199 --> 907.04
without such a hassle but that was

910.839 --> 915.2790000000001
interesting

913.12 --> 917.92
it's funny actually i didn't expect this

915.279 --> 922.0
but the talking is

917.92 --> 922.0
is doing some good

922.32 --> 927.839
i haven't talked a lot you know just on

924.24 --> 927.839
the phone a couple of times

930.0 --> 937.759
yeah i keep on having snot

934.399 --> 937.759
that i cannot swallow

937.839 --> 941.2790000000001
like i don't trust doing that it's

939.6 --> 943.6800000000001
probably going to make things worse i

941.279 --> 946.68
don't know maybe i should

943.68 --> 949.87
it's just been pouring out

946.68 --> 949.87
[Music]

950.079 --> 954.2399999999999
although i don't have a cold you know

952.32 --> 956.1600000000001
it's not that it's just

954.24 --> 958.32
so what exactly happened i drank too

956.16 --> 960.88
much alcohol

958.32 --> 962.639
and didn't eat properly and then sort of

960.88 --> 969.8389999999999
fell asleep and then i got sick

962.639 --> 969.839
really really bad the next day

970.24 --> 975.6
like i drank too much on an empty

972.24 --> 975.6
stomach pretty much

975.839 --> 982.5600000000001
that happened saturday evening

979.36 --> 983.6800000000001
and that gave me pretty much an entire

982.56 --> 986.3199999999999
day of hell

983.68 --> 986.3199999999999
yesterday

994.839 --> 1001.519
so

997.759 --> 1001.519
what tiny one more

1006.24 --> 1010.24
yeah during poison you will get sick

1007.92 --> 1012.88
yeah that's also why

1010.24 --> 1015.839
and it's tough because i discussed this

1012.88 --> 1020.88
with my dad and my healer

1015.839 --> 1023.9200000000001
like of course everyone will say this

1020.88 --> 1026.16
i have to stop drinking but maybe this

1023.92 --> 1029.4389999999999
time i really have to

1026.16 --> 1029.76
because it was already on my mind a lot

1029.439 --> 1032.24
like

1029.76 --> 1033.36
i want to stop drinking i got it under

1032.24 --> 1035.76
control

1033.36 --> 1037.6789999999999
but i want to stop drinking but it's

1035.76 --> 1040.079
hard to step away

1037.679 --> 1042.88
from the habit from that moment in the

1040.079 --> 1046.0
day where i just have fun

1042.88 --> 1048.0
and feel a little relief but

1046.0 --> 1049.76
yeah safe to say of course that

1048.0 --> 1051.679
yesterday and today

1049.76 --> 1053.52
nothing i haven't smoked there's still

1051.679 --> 1057.2800000000002
like an

1053.52 --> 1057.28
unfinished joint sitting there

1058.64 --> 1067.2800000000002
but i'm really gonna try to give up

1062.559 --> 1068.6399999999999
on drinking my dad also has like a long

1067.28 --> 1071.44
time ago

1068.64 --> 1073.3600000000001
several years ago and he's like has no

1071.44 --> 1076.0
problem with it it's only good so maybe

1073.36 --> 1079.12
it's time maybe i'm just

1076.0 --> 1080.96
getting too old for that [ __ ]

1079.12 --> 1084.4799999999998
didn't you think you were a big drinker

1080.96 --> 1084.48
no i'm not a big drinker at all

1086.24 --> 1093.44
i yeah i had two beers

1089.6 --> 1096.0
a day that was kind of my the amount

1093.44 --> 1098.4
because more would eventually end up bad

1096.0 --> 1098.96
now yeah yeah saturday i drank a lot

1098.4 --> 1101.52
more

1098.96 --> 1102.559
i had three beers and almost an entire

1101.52 --> 1106.16
bottle of wine

1102.559 --> 1109.84
was ridiculous i feel so ashamed

1106.16 --> 1109.8400000000001
that it was that stupid

1110.0 --> 1113.12
it's really stupid

1117.919 --> 1123.8400000000001
a little sugar could help i don't know

1120.84 --> 1123.84
if

1134.84 --> 1137.84
uh

1138.96 --> 1142.64
all right well look two beers don't

1141.2 --> 1145.039
bother me

1142.64 --> 1145.039
at all

1146.24 --> 1149.52
i get it out of my system before i go to

1148.32 --> 1152.08
bed

1149.52 --> 1153.76
it's kind of a condition do not go to

1152.08 --> 1155.84
sleep drunk because that's when things

1153.76 --> 1159.76
go wrong

1155.84 --> 1163.6
and yeah it's worked out great

1159.76 --> 1166.32
for a year now but

1163.6 --> 1166.32
it's just

1167.12 --> 1172.32
i don't know man this is just this is

1169.76 --> 1173.2
the worst time i got sick ever i just

1172.32 --> 1179.84
have to

1173.2 --> 1179.8400000000001
i have to i can't just ignore this

1185.2 --> 1189.039
a little sugar i don't know if sugar

1187.44 --> 1193.8400000000001
helps

1189.039 --> 1193.84
does it

1200.72 --> 1207.84
like a band like bank loan

1204.32 --> 1207.84
i never tried that though

1207.919 --> 1212.96
the outer pounds ponds philosophy

1218.84 --> 1221.84
hmm

1223.2 --> 1228.559
i don't have that look i got all kinds

1226.559 --> 1231.76
of things here right

1228.559 --> 1232.84
but like last night i even tried like

1231.76 --> 1236.96
getting down

1232.84 --> 1239.6
uh yeah one

1236.96 --> 1240.559
tablet that basically gives your gut

1239.6 --> 1242.7199999999998
flora

1240.559 --> 1244.72
helps that because yeah it's bound to be

1242.72 --> 1246.88
all wrecked

1244.72 --> 1249.6000000000001
but even that was just too much i

1246.88 --> 1252.0800000000002
there's nothing

1249.6 --> 1252.799
like it does not want anything solid at

1252.08 --> 1255.12
the moment

1252.799 --> 1255.12
at all

1258.0 --> 1268.559
yeah i i yeah i have drank pretty

1263.919 --> 1268.5590000000002
pretty amounts of water like two bottles

1270.72 --> 1273.84
chicken soup yeah yeah

1275.28 --> 1279.28
it's not really hot anymore now the

1278.559 --> 1282.0
problem too

1279.28 --> 1282.96
is that i don't know it's kind of cold

1282.0 --> 1285.36
weather

1282.96 --> 1286.32
and so this stuff all cools off very

1285.36 --> 1289.76
quickly

1286.32 --> 1291.12
like i pour in a cup of tea take one

1289.76 --> 1293.6
little sip and then

1291.12 --> 1295.1999999999998
like go to sleep and then when i get

1293.6 --> 1300.799
wake up again it's all cold

1295.2 --> 1300.799
it's kind of annoying no no dry toast

1301.52 --> 1306.24
look when my stomach recovers i'll know

1306.96 --> 1314.08
just it's a record like yeah i know

1311.76 --> 1316.64
it's not the first time it's just the

1314.08 --> 1320.24
worst time

1316.64 --> 1324.159
i've never had it this long

1320.24 --> 1326.32
over a day isn't that crazy

1324.159 --> 1327.7600000000002
yeah the last time i thought was the

1326.32 --> 1330.96
worst time it lasted

1327.76 --> 1332.0
24 hours and then it was gone it was a

1330.96 --> 1335.3600000000001
little feeble but

1332.0 --> 1338.24
it was fine now it's just

1335.36 --> 1338.7199999999998
i feel literally like i just received a

1338.24 --> 1340.799
big

1338.72 --> 1342.0
pounding from people like they literally

1340.799 --> 1347.84
all just

1342.0 --> 1347.84
bashed me in the stomach

1348.32 --> 1355.36
because yeah at times it was so bad that

1352.159 --> 1358.7990000000002
literally i had cramps

1355.36 --> 1361.84
just the muscle over cramped

1358.799 --> 1361.84
it's weird

1363.44 --> 1366.0800000000002
right anyway

1371.919 --> 1376.159
does the cool air help though

1377.6 --> 1384.7199999999998
well it's a difficult one because yes

1381.12 --> 1388.08
the fresh air helps but the cooling down

1384.72 --> 1390.88
part not so much

1388.08 --> 1392.72
but it's weird it's like even when i'm

1390.88 --> 1395.7600000000002
in bed i get

1392.72 --> 1397.76
periods where i just

1395.76 --> 1399.6
are just really looking out the warmth

1397.76 --> 1402.8799999999999
and then it's suddenly it's like oh

1399.6 --> 1405.52
no i have to get rid of the heat

1402.88 --> 1408.24
and then yeah so i don't know when it's

1405.52 --> 1408.24
just cycles

1417.12 --> 1421.76
it's funny i feel a little better

1422.08 --> 1427.6789999999999
like as i did right before i started the

1425.44 --> 1427.679
show

1429.12 --> 1432.559
does my voice sound a little better too

1432.0 --> 1435.84
my

1432.559 --> 1435.84
voice sounds terrible

1436.0 --> 1445.84
because my throat is all swollen up guys

1439.36 --> 1445.84
it's literally that's not normal

1452.48 --> 1457.039
this should be here it's all the way

1454.4 --> 1457.039
down there

1457.679 --> 1460.799
yeah raspy voice

1467.679 --> 1472.48
right yeah you know the alcohol i do see

1470.48 --> 1475.039
it as like a god's punishment

1472.48 --> 1475.84
it is that it's basically god telling

1475.039 --> 1478.24
you

1475.84 --> 1480.6399999999999
the design telling you this is not good

1478.24 --> 1480.64
buddy

1480.799 --> 1488.1589999999999
you're being irresponsible and making it

1484.48 --> 1492.32
very painful not dangerous deadly

1488.159 --> 1495.8400000000001
but just very painful and that's

1492.32 --> 1496.3999999999999
like a good thing i guess just to get it

1495.84 --> 1498.32
through

1496.4 --> 1500.64
your head like yeah you shouldn't do

1498.32 --> 1500.6399999999999
that

1503.919 --> 1507.76
yeah i am a bit better but i'm still

1506.799 --> 1509.84
kind of feeble

1507.76 --> 1511.2
but i feel a little bit more energy it's

1509.84 --> 1513.84
funny

1511.2 --> 1514.52
also one thing i notice is that i feel

1513.84 --> 1518.0
so

1514.52 --> 1520.08
unbelievably clear in my mind

1518.0 --> 1521.679
it's weird though because my eyes are a

1520.08 --> 1524.1589999999999
little twisty

1521.679 --> 1525.2
i have trouble looking straight because

1524.159 --> 1529.3600000000001
of

1525.2 --> 1532.64
yeah yesterday vomiting and all that

1529.36 --> 1536.08
but like this whole situation gave me

1532.64 --> 1538.7990000000002
like this radical fasting day yesterday

1536.08 --> 1540.3999999999999
literally it's not at a thing not a

1538.799 --> 1545.2
single thing

1540.4 --> 1545.2
radical fasting and that's

1546.24 --> 1552.32
made yeah it's it's

1549.6 --> 1552.32
it's funny

1552.88 --> 1559.0390000000002
because like

1556.64 --> 1560.96
the light out there seems more clear to

1559.039 --> 1564.72
me now

1560.96 --> 1566.559
my hearing is very fine and also i guess

1564.72 --> 1567.3600000000001
because of my own training what i did

1566.559 --> 1570.3999999999999
yesterday

1567.36 --> 1572.7199999999998
just to get asleep my head is not filled

1570.4 --> 1575.039
with a lot of chaos

1572.72 --> 1577.279
because i'm used to constantly drinking

1575.039 --> 1577.279
things

1579.2 --> 1585.8400000000001
always it's so automated that

1582.64 --> 1588.88
it's not even like the normal conscious

1585.84 --> 1591.4399999999998
attention a person would give ideas

1588.88 --> 1593.7600000000002
it's just fully automated like a giant

1591.44 --> 1596.559
warehouse is going down all the time

1593.76 --> 1596.96
that's usually what happens with me

1596.559 --> 1600.96
that's

1596.96 --> 1604.08
also yeah i use that but now it's

1600.96 --> 1604.08
like they're on vacation

1605.039 --> 1613.84
it's like

1618.32 --> 1620.6399999999999
hmm

1622.08 --> 1628.08
i don't know i think i'll probably

1625.2 --> 1631.039
be all right in the evening sorry for

1628.08 --> 1631.039
the spitting it's just

1631.279 --> 1641.84
not gonna swallow that um

1636.159 --> 1641.8400000000001
got a pink bucket behind me

1645.05 --> 1648.099
[Music]

1652.84 --> 1658.0
what

1654.159 --> 1662.0800000000002
tasting stuff well i don't even think

1658.0 --> 1662.08
red wine and beer tastes that good

1664.32 --> 1669.84
and like the

1671.2 --> 1674.0800000000002
bubbles balls

1675.36 --> 1680.0
uh yeah like sweet licorice

1678.48 --> 1684.64
or what what do you call that sweet

1680.0 --> 1684.64
liquor i don't even try that

1689.84 --> 1693.9189999999999
like i've had a lot of issues with that

1691.76 --> 1697.6
in the past

1693.919 --> 1699.1200000000001
so it's kind of like mid 20s i i just

1697.6 --> 1701.52
completely stopped that

1699.12 --> 1702.2399999999998
no earlier i guess i think that like

1701.52 --> 1707.039
around

1702.24 --> 1707.039
22 i just completely quit all sweet

1708.24 --> 1713.44
yeah sweet strong alcoholic drinks

1720.559 --> 1725.84
what's this

1728.32 --> 1732.08
nathan oakley's starting a call

1736.84 --> 1739.84
what

1745.679 --> 1747.919
hmm

1749.76 --> 1753.84
right so let's not talk about alcohol

1764.84 --> 1767.84
please

1783.2 --> 1786.64
okay that's an interesting thing you

1784.72 --> 1789.679
would say that

1786.64 --> 1793.1200000000001
because it's usually around

1789.679 --> 1795.52
well like the end of my show the end of

1793.12 --> 1799.039
the flatter debates where i start to

1795.52 --> 1802.72
like get a drink get my beer

1799.039 --> 1805.039
around that time so and yeah i do

1802.72 --> 1807.2
anticipate that always my body does

1805.039 --> 1810.64
anticipate that

1807.2 --> 1810.64
but of course not today

1817.36 --> 1824.8799999999999
because yeah obviously my body is

1820.84 --> 1827.279
completely yeah out of its normal

1824.88 --> 1827.279
rhythm

1830.64 --> 1835.279
yeah try some of this like water with

1834.399 --> 1837.84
some lemon

1835.279 --> 1837.84
juice in it

1839.36 --> 1851.84
very thin but

1860.559 --> 1867.279
right so guys uh and girls what did i

1864.399 --> 1867.279

yeah or well i did turn it on to say

1876.559 --> 1879.84
that i wasn't going to do my show

1886.399 --> 1889.5189999999998

come on

1965.279 --> 1972.64
yeah i get that vitamin c but pepper is

1968.64 --> 1972.64
not exactly the smartest way to go with

1974.84 --> 1978.9599999999998
that

1976.64 --> 1991.8400000000001

clothes on and it's still cold

2254.839 --> 2259.119
uh yeah to not too much punishment

2257.68 --> 2261.9199999999996
because yeah when i

2259.119 --> 2262.32
throw up violently with pain and [ __ ]

2261.92 --> 2265.52
they

2262.32 --> 2272.2400000000002
get to buy it yeah they they get

2265.52 --> 2272.24
the impact too so yeah

2280.079 --> 2283.2000000000003
yeah it was over here

2283.52 --> 2286.64
the truck with the beeps

2293.04 --> 2302.079
why what's going on here who is calling

2298.88 --> 2302.079
over at masterpiece

2302.16 --> 2313.839
like somebody's doing a call

2318.64 --> 2320.96
hmm

2321.76 --> 2325.5200000000004
this is weird i am starting to slowly

2324.32 --> 2330.32
feel a little better

2325.52 --> 2330.32
like the yawning is a good sign

2337.119 --> 2344.0
i think that my metabolism can probably

2340.24 --> 2346.3199999999997
restore before the sun goes down

2344.0 --> 2347.839
but still yeah there's nothing gonna fit

2346.32 --> 2349.52
in there so

2347.839 --> 2351.359
before i properly eat it's gonna

2349.52 --> 2354.32
probably be tomorrow

2351.359 --> 2354.3199999999997
maybe in the night

2362.8 --> 2368.1600000000003
eat and move buddy take a walk maybe

2366.16 --> 2370.16
i was thinking earlier of going to the

2368.16 --> 2372.96
grocery stores and get some really good

2370.16 --> 2372.96
fruit juices

2373.52 --> 2380.32
but then i got nauseated again and yeah

2376.56 --> 2382.24
instead i just went to sleep so yeah

2380.32 --> 2383.3590000000004
i'm really nervous you know because if

2382.24 --> 2386.72
i'm gonna go out there

2383.359 --> 2389.2
it's gonna be like at least 20 minutes

2386.72 --> 2391.1189999999997
of me being out there with the cold

2389.2 --> 2392.96
and if i suddenly get an attack of

2391.119 --> 2396.079
nausea

2392.96 --> 2399.119
yeah then what what do i just

2396.079 --> 2399.119
pull over and just

2400.96 --> 2404.56
no that would be problematic

2407.68 --> 2413.359
like if i'm gonna go out then i must be

2411.28 --> 2416.7200000000003
sure that i'm not gonna get sick while

2413.359 --> 2416.72
doing that or i'm gonna have a big

2422.839 --> 2425.839
problem

2425.92 --> 2439.839
