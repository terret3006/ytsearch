bird number

66.619 --> 72.18
1723 I'm your host Arwin and before we

70.439 --> 74.63999999999999
start the show please don't forget to

72.18 --> 77.34

74.64 --> 79.799
and if you haven't already subscribe to

77.34 --> 81.96000000000001
my channel hit the Bell notification so

weekdays and two PM Amsterdam time in

use the support

94.56 --> 101.34
so yeah please keep it coming

97.5 --> 103.38
whether today is different

101.34 --> 106.07900000000001
it's not a big gray soup there's some

103.38 --> 109.02
blue sky here and there but

106.079 --> 111.05999999999999
it's a lot of wind and there's a bunch

109.02 --> 113.84
of clouds

111.06 --> 113.84
but it's still

115.2 --> 118.32000000000001
it's a little bit more warm than

116.82 --> 121.19999999999999
yesterday but yeah it's because there's

118.32 --> 123.53999999999999
not a big gray suit that usually tends

121.2 --> 125.7
to cool everything off

123.54 --> 128.16
so it's

125.7 --> 130.02
a bit of a nudge back to

128.16 --> 132.72
being nice there's a big cloud coming

130.02 --> 134.70000000000002
over by the way right now

132.72 --> 136.62
so I don't know it might just start

134.7 --> 139.33999999999997
raining soon

136.62 --> 139.34
we'll see

145.739 --> 150.42000000000002
um

147.42 --> 150.42
right

154.08 --> 160.8

161.76 --> 164.48
temperature

165.66 --> 168.98
21 degrees Yeah

171.959 --> 176.06
right it just has clouded

176.459 --> 182.78
all right we'll see

179.58 --> 186.12
forecast is coming week

182.78 --> 189.66
dancing around the 20

186.12 --> 193.739
degrees Celsius and

189.66 --> 196.26
mostly clouded a bit of rain bit of sun

193.739 --> 199.459
so yeah we'll see

196.26 --> 199.459
typical Autumn weather

200.94 --> 205.5
hello kumu virus first in chat good to

203.4 --> 208.34
see you

205.5 --> 208.34
how you doing

210.36 --> 213.31900000000002
pretty good

216.36 --> 221.22000000000003
it's got a bit of an issue back with my

218.7 --> 223.01899999999998
shoulder but I mean it's like it's the

221.22 --> 225.18
weather

223.019 --> 227.28
all right so I might have to like go

225.18 --> 229.20000000000002
back to Triple dosing vitamin C I

227.28 --> 232.379
haven't for a while

229.2 --> 235.14
it did really work that time like I took

232.379 --> 237.42
it like a week triple dose

235.14 --> 241.61999999999998
and then those issues just kind of

237.42 --> 245.95899999999997
stopped maybe I took it two weeks

241.62 --> 245.959
I'm not sure but I stopped for a while

250.2 --> 257.479
doing great alrighty then

252.599 --> 261.739
got your hair done I feel fabulous okay

257.479 --> 261.739
hey dank good to see you

273.66 --> 276.56
hey us

277.95 --> 281.079
[Applause]

287.12 --> 292.5
I don't know what it is today I feel

289.5 --> 295.38
just slightly flustered

292.5 --> 298.5
maybe it'll go away

295.38 --> 300.65999999999997
it was like a very coffee morning well

298.5 --> 302.82
not coughing I don't actually cough but

300.66 --> 304.91900000000004
just like mucus just keeps coming and

302.82 --> 306.96
[ __ ] it happens sometimes in the morning

304.919 --> 308.15999999999997
I mean probably a lot of you know about

306.96 --> 310.19899999999996
that

308.16 --> 312.3
ah

310.199 --> 315.06
it's just one of those days and I think

312.3 --> 317.28000000000003
Nathan too yeah because Nathan might not

315.06 --> 319.979
be having a show because he seems to be

317.28 --> 321.96
having ear issues again

319.979 --> 324.9
that's what yeah the past that's

321.96 --> 327.65999999999997
happened a couple of times

324.9 --> 329.15999999999997
where it just gets painful

327.66 --> 332.0
so

329.16 --> 332.0
we'll see

334.44 --> 340.8
it's just Springtime and then suddenly

338.1 --> 343.32000000000005
like health problems just suddenly come

340.8 --> 345.6
out of nowhere but

343.32 --> 348.9
it's all very containable very important

345.6 --> 351.0
in my opinion that during this phase you

348.9 --> 352.979
keep the summer with you and you stay

351.0 --> 354.96
positive you don't like oh no The

352.979 --> 356.88
Summer's over and oh I'm getting sick

354.96 --> 358.5
because that's gonna actually make it

356.88 --> 363.08
worse

358.5 --> 363.08
so it's just like nah that's fine

363.539 --> 369.71999999999997
it's just body needs to adapt a little

366.06 --> 372.3
and but keep the good attitude don't

369.72 --> 374.699
roll into negativity because that'll

372.3 --> 376.62
just make everything worse including the

374.699 --> 379.62
actual sickness symptoms by the way

376.62 --> 382.319
don't know if anybody ever noticed that

379.62 --> 385.919
that if you are sick for whatever reason

382.319 --> 387.28000000000003
and you're like really demoralized that

385.919 --> 390.0
literally makes it worse

387.28 --> 393.05999999999995
[Music]

390.0 --> 394.74
light elaborates the symptoms a lot of

393.06 --> 397.199
the time or if there's some pain

394.74 --> 399.6
involved it just starts to hurt more

397.199 --> 402.62
that's what I've noticed

399.6 --> 402.62
throughout my life

403.56 --> 407.479
a fiber outs could see you

416.52 --> 422.539
yeah if you calmed down a bit fiber oats

424.139 --> 426.62
right

427.8 --> 434.1
I get it like you're very nervous

430.819 --> 436.56
excited by the whole situation but

434.1 --> 438.66
it's much better more effective if you

436.56 --> 441.8
if you're calm so

438.66 --> 441.8
how are you feeling today

450.419 --> 455.24
all right okay well that sounds better

460.62 --> 464.639
I'm kind of surprised I haven't seen you

464.639 --> 470.18

467.52 --> 470.18

how are you feeling man are you gonna do

691.86 --> 694.399

694.87 --> 697.999
[Music]

708.36 --> 711.74
and decided okay

714.57 --> 717.7090000000001
[Music]

765.24 --> 770.88
look fiber I don't know exactly what

767.339 --> 773.5790000000001
what's holding your back or anything but

770.88 --> 776.7
I strongly recommend you

773.579 --> 779.0999999999999
you don't wait for like the rush

776.7 --> 782.1600000000001
which also brings fear

779.1 --> 784.74
for that to subside

782.16 --> 787.56
you need to you need to use the wave

784.74 --> 790.26
even if there is fear in it

787.56 --> 792.06
you need to use it

790.26 --> 794.24
there's stuff you need to learn right

792.06 --> 794.2399999999999
now

798.72 --> 805.339
Don't Escape

801.36 --> 805.339
you'll be sorry afterwards if you do

805.68 --> 812.4799999999999
you want okay I don't know maybe you're

808.32 --> 812.48
just really busy I'm not sure just

817.63 --> 823.139
[Music]

820.68 --> 826.1999999999999
I'm trying to get out okay

823.139 --> 829.26
I'm just saying you could literally just

826.2 --> 831.3000000000001
start saying what the sharing the

829.26 --> 834.8
information you think you need to share

831.3 --> 834.8
with him oh hold on

870.54 --> 875.8199999999999
yeah sorry that was just

874.27 --> 878.399
[Music]

875.82 --> 881.7600000000001
maintenance guide I had to check the

878.399 --> 881.76
fire extinguishers

885.5 --> 891.899
so I'm still going to work today

889.62 --> 894.68
you're just too busy okay fair enough

891.899 --> 894.68
eyebrows

895.76 --> 901.16
[Music]

897.0 --> 901.16
yeah that probably will suck

901.5 --> 907.76
but I don't know maybe yeah try not to

904.56 --> 910.7399999999999
impose any negativity on your own path

907.76 --> 913.68
like it's probably going to be plenty

910.74 --> 917.22
that's gonna arrive without you like

913.68 --> 918.7199999999999
for seeing it for yourself just just so

917.22 --> 921.0600000000001
you know

918.72 --> 925.22
a bit of advice

921.06 --> 925.2199999999999
but I mean I I feel for you though

927.899 --> 931.139
pushing you appreciate me pushing you

929.76 --> 933.18
through yeah

931.139 --> 935.399
I'm glad you do

933.18 --> 937.3199999999999
I mean back in the day I was

935.399 --> 940.32
a couple of times where bad things would

937.32 --> 942.6600000000001
happen my parents would also get kind of

940.32 --> 945.24
pushy and that was really helpful even

942.66 --> 947.88
though I hated it when it was happening

945.24 --> 950.1800000000001
I just wanted to be left alone like just

947.88 --> 953.1
let me

950.18 --> 955.3199999999999
Retreat to some hole and then I just

953.1 --> 959.779
want to sit there for two days

955.32 --> 963.98
and that's like not that's not effective

959.779 --> 963.98
but I am kind of that type

964.74 --> 970.86
and so yeah

967.56 --> 973.0189999999999
I remember how much I act how important

970.86 --> 975.1800000000001
it was that people pushed me around when

973.019 --> 978.18
bad things happened so that I would stay

975.18 --> 979.8599999999999
on course so I'm doing it now even

978.18 --> 983.12
though I know it's probably a bit

979.86 --> 983.12
unpleasant anyways

983.48 --> 987.899
[Music]

984.959 --> 990.5
I I just see

987.899 --> 990.5
foreign

995.279 --> 999.48
it's like every time something like this

997.44 --> 1001.1
happens I see it is like it's another

999.48 --> 1003.6990000000001
challenge from God

1001.1 --> 1006.86
so it's an opportunity to prove yourself

1003.699 --> 1008.18
to God

1006.86 --> 1011.24
it's like

1008.18 --> 1013.279
everything that happens out there that

1011.24 --> 1014.0
catches your heart because it's close to

1013.279 --> 1017.3
it

1014.0 --> 1021.32
it's like the

1017.3 --> 1023.5999999999999
I forget the name the but the pain box

1021.32 --> 1026.48
from Dune

1023.6 --> 1028.819
it's like you're gonna have very

1026.48 --> 1031.1
unpleasant things how are you gonna

1028.819 --> 1033.62
control yourself when that happens

1031.1 --> 1036.839
and I'm personally fascinated with that

1033.62 --> 1038.6599999999999
[ __ ] for myself

1036.839 --> 1041.6599999999999
[Music]

1038.66 --> 1044.14
but it also just really helps to kind of

1041.66 --> 1044.14
weirdly

1046.88 --> 1051.3200000000002
it's weird it's almost like I'm

1048.919 --> 1053.1200000000001
grappling myself in a way but not in a

1051.32 --> 1056.26
negative way because it's like oh

1053.12 --> 1056.26
something shit's happened

1057.76 --> 1062.6
but yeah but not just oh I'm gonna get

1060.5 --> 1065.9
rich I'm gonna scam but like it's a

1062.6 --> 1067.8799999999999
great opportunity to to show off like

1065.9 --> 1070.7
how well I got myself under control and

1067.88 --> 1072.2600000000002
that's like part of the thing that I'm

1070.7 --> 1075.14
striving for

1072.26 --> 1077.919
and trying to demonstrate so in that

1075.14 --> 1077.919
sense like

1078.32 --> 1083.1789999999999
there's for me there is almost no like

1080.96 --> 1085.22
oh no not this

1083.179 --> 1087.44
it's like everything that's oh no not

1085.22 --> 1089.1200000000001
this is like oh [ __ ] that just means

1087.44 --> 1091.1000000000001
it's a really big challenge I could

1089.12 --> 1095.0
really win this

1091.1 --> 1098.299
and that just makes me not feel like oh

1095.0 --> 1100.52
[ __ ] like oh time is just a matter of

1098.299 --> 1103.7
waiting until something terrible happens

1100.52 --> 1105.26
that ruins everything right because when

1103.7 --> 1108.5
your mind dwells on that kind of

1105.26 --> 1111.26
thinking that just ruins everything and

1108.5 --> 1113.78
it and it drains you from energy so

1111.26 --> 1115.94
instead I look at everything as oh

1113.78 --> 1119.0
something [ __ ] happens oh well that me

1115.94 --> 1121.8200000000002
it's like another test in school

1119.0 --> 1125.36
literally that's how I see it now

1121.82 --> 1127.58
and then instead of wasting my energy on

1125.36 --> 1129.1999999999998
moping

1127.58 --> 1131.48
I take

1129.2 --> 1133.46
instead of grief I take it as pressure

1131.48 --> 1135.559
for performance and it's like I

1133.46 --> 1138.76
basically trick

1135.559 --> 1142.52
what a trick it's just re

1138.76 --> 1144.919
-realign how energies are entering just

1142.52 --> 1146.6
like oh there's this pattern of energy

1144.919 --> 1149.9
just coming through you and it's

1146.6 --> 1151.8799999999999
different influences and I'm like this

1149.9 --> 1155.179
could technically be

1151.88 --> 1157.22
slightly bent and then you could turn it

1155.179 --> 1159.02
into a productive Drive

1157.22 --> 1161.179
and if you do it like this with this one

1159.02 --> 1164.0
and with that like that one and then

1161.179 --> 1167.7800000000002
even though it started it enters that

1164.0 --> 1170.24
grief but it exits as a as a challenge

1167.78 --> 1174.26
it's and then

1170.24 --> 1177.559
you don't get the grief not really

1174.26 --> 1179.78
you get to learn how to control a

1177.559 --> 1182.84
situation that could potentially create

1179.78 --> 1187.22
that grief instead

1182.84 --> 1190.059
it's like a hyper productivity thing

1187.22 --> 1190.059
like

1190.1 --> 1194.539
yeah I don't know how well it would work

1192.44 --> 1196.7
for General people out there that are

1194.539 --> 1199.28
actually really busy

1196.7 --> 1201.919
because then doing things differently or

1199.28 --> 1204.02
getting very distracted usually damages

1201.919 --> 1207.039
the productivity

1204.02 --> 1207.039
but for me

1207.799 --> 1216.6399999999999
who's very focused on communication

1212.179 --> 1216.64
and all that it's really helpful

1217.16 --> 1219.76
thank you

1219.919 --> 1222.5800000000002
anyway

1223.22 --> 1227.02
Halo fruit it's you

1234.63 --> 1237.729
[Music]

1245.78 --> 1251.66
right and so to summarize basically what

1249.08 --> 1253.039
I do is just like think of the situation

1251.66 --> 1254.48
differently

1253.039 --> 1257.48
it's like

1254.48 --> 1259.46
well you could very much straightforward

1257.48 --> 1260.78
argue like oh this is that this is that

1259.46 --> 1263.0
it's bad

1260.78 --> 1264.86
it's gonna have this kind of influence

1263.0 --> 1269.299
on my feelings and

1264.86 --> 1272.78
or you could think of it differently

1269.299 --> 1275.4189999999999
as in but maybe it's just a challenge of

1272.78 --> 1278.84
God and just if he's just gonna have

1275.419 --> 1280.1000000000001
like a little look if I'm gonna like uh

1278.84 --> 1282.5
get

1280.1 --> 1286.6999999999998
sucked up by the feelings of the

1282.5 --> 1290.48
situation and then let it pacify me

1286.7 --> 1294.5
or whether I like a rock

1290.48 --> 1296.0
like brace against it and then like

1294.5 --> 1299.419
separated

1296.0 --> 1303.34
from me so that I retain the frequencies

1299.419 --> 1306.22
I had and then find a way to

1303.34 --> 1310.28
realign the energies that are entering

1306.22 --> 1314.1200000000001
to transform them into

1310.28 --> 1317.6
a whole different type of energy

1314.12 --> 1320.7199999999998
to basically Judo move

1317.6 --> 1323.059
the grief that comes towards you

1320.72 --> 1325.1200000000001
and so like instead of letting it make

1323.059 --> 1330.1
an impact on you

1325.12 --> 1330.1
you put it to work for something else

1330.3 --> 1335.059
[Music]

1331.82 --> 1336.559
and that really works guys

1335.059 --> 1338.72
like that is like one of the most

1336.559 --> 1340.76
magnificent tricks that I've ever come

1338.72 --> 1343.22
across in my life and I've applied it in

1340.76 --> 1345.02
many occasions It's just sometimes I

1343.22 --> 1347.98
just wouldn't do it because I'm actually

1345.02 --> 1347.98
studying

1348.799 --> 1355.039
like

1350.84 --> 1357.74
the dwelling I've also studied the

1355.039 --> 1359.86
dwelling of it like the dwelling of the

1357.74 --> 1362.48
failure

1359.86 --> 1364.2199999999998
to see what happens and to see how it

1362.48 --> 1365.96
changes perspective

1364.22 --> 1367.71
right it's like no matter what happens

1365.96 --> 1369.74
I'm gonna pay attention

1367.71 --> 1371.98
[Music]

1369.74 --> 1371.98
foreign

1374.72 --> 1380.1200000000001
but I had to like dwell through the

1377.6 --> 1381.5
through the more negative part to really

1380.12 --> 1385.039
realize

1381.5 --> 1387.02
it for what it really is do not try to

1385.039 --> 1389.059
escape from those moments with my mind

1387.02 --> 1392.12
but to just realized like no this is

1389.059 --> 1394.7
like down time and it's

1392.12 --> 1397.6
people aren't thankful for it

1394.7 --> 1397.6000000000001
when you do that

1399.73 --> 1402.88
[Music]

1405.14 --> 1409.039
it's like they'll understand

1407.179 --> 1410.9
they're not thankful it's not like oh

1409.039 --> 1414.02
you did a really good thing when you do

1410.9 --> 1417.26
that no you literally failed

1414.02 --> 1419.48
because if you when things happen and

1417.26 --> 1421.34
you just don't let it

1419.48 --> 1423.5
slow you down

1421.34 --> 1425.6
but instead like Judo moved the

1423.5 --> 1428.059
situation

1425.6 --> 1431.1789999999999
and then maybe do a little bit with

1428.059 --> 1433.52
after Quakes because it is very tension

1431.179 --> 1435.44
inducing sometimes to actually start

1433.52 --> 1438.3799999999999
doing that because you're gonna have to

1435.44 --> 1441.38
go against your normal instincts

1438.38 --> 1443.659
I mean you don't typically learn this as

1441.38 --> 1447.919
a little kid or a baby

1443.659 --> 1449.72
you learn all feelings quickly just go

1447.919 --> 1452.1200000000001
through it

1449.72 --> 1453.98
like communicate the feelings

1452.12 --> 1458.1399999999999
that's how we learn it and I mean yeah

1453.98 --> 1458.14
it has also a function a social function

1458.419 --> 1465.0200000000002
but you don't automatically learn like

1460.64 --> 1467.7800000000002
oh this bad thing that I'm experiencing

1465.02 --> 1470.48
how could I like change

1467.78 --> 1473.8999999999999
the ways I think about certain feelings

1470.48 --> 1477.98
and ideas in order to like

1473.9 --> 1480.799
get me into like a creative process

1477.98 --> 1482.659
you have to teach that to yourself or

1480.799 --> 1484.28
somebody has to teach that to you it has

1482.659 --> 1486.8600000000001
to make you realize that that is

1484.28 --> 1489.799
something that you could choose to do

1486.86 --> 1491.6589999999999
if you keep there with your focus

1489.799 --> 1494.08
because like that's the problem right

1491.659 --> 1499.1000000000001
when grief comes or a bad situation

1494.08 --> 1501.32
focus is has the Tendencies to go first

1499.1 --> 1504.1399999999999
they have to hold on to that it's like

1501.32 --> 1508.1
oh something bad make sure you hold on

1504.14 --> 1510.44
to focus don't let it get knocked off

1508.1 --> 1512.299
because then your whole day will be off

1510.44 --> 1514.1000000000001
usually

1512.299 --> 1516.62
right

1514.1 --> 1520.4599999999998
you don't learn that as a kid

1516.62 --> 1522.9189999999999
parents don't teach you that

1520.46 --> 1526.1000000000001
and maybe when you're very little you

1522.919 --> 1528.38
literally can't do that

1526.1 --> 1532.039
but when you're older especially if

1528.38 --> 1533.16
you're kind of smart you can potentially

1532.039 --> 1534.44
learn to do that

1533.16 --> 1536.8400000000001
[Music]

1534.44 --> 1540.14
and to be fair I think there's even a

1536.84 --> 1543.1399999999999
weird thing where Grabbers

1540.14 --> 1544.76
and maybe even these new world order

1543.14 --> 1549.0800000000002
freaks

1544.76 --> 1552.44
also use this trick to basically take

1549.08 --> 1555.9189999999999
the endless hostility

1552.44 --> 1558.8600000000001
and like transform its energy

1555.919 --> 1560.48
into a motivating factor that isn't

1558.86 --> 1563.059
based on fear

1560.48 --> 1564.98
like they they use it to motivate

1563.059 --> 1567.799
themselves perhaps

1564.98 --> 1570.1
but then trick themselves out of the

1567.799 --> 1570.1
fear

1570.32 --> 1576.26
I think that the elite is basically

1573.32 --> 1580.36
using this skill too and I think that

1576.26 --> 1580.36
we should all use this skill

1581.62 --> 1587.6
they're abusing it

1584.059 --> 1590.24
but we could use it to be more positive

1587.6 --> 1592.9399999999998
with our own lives

1590.24 --> 1595.58
and also in that sense Force more

1592.94 --> 1598.279
respect people get respect for you when

1595.58 --> 1600.799
something happy happens and you show

1598.279 --> 1603.5
that you're like almost unfazed you

1600.799 --> 1604.82
don't get knocked off your of your feet

1603.5 --> 1607.58
by it

1604.82 --> 1610.34
that kind of forces some respect too so

1607.58 --> 1612.799
there's like credit to be gained even by

1610.34 --> 1616.1589999999999
doing this

1612.799 --> 1617.96
fairy wealth worth the effort

1616.159 --> 1620.1200000000001
because it is a effort it definitely

1617.96 --> 1621.799
will be an effort it's never going to be

1620.12 --> 1623.8999999999999
effortless but especially at the

1621.799 --> 1627.32
beginning if you've never like really

1623.9 --> 1629.3600000000001
done it it's yeah you'll get so

1627.32 --> 1631.52
distracted I remember when I first

1629.36 --> 1635.4189999999999
started trying really doing this on a

1631.52 --> 1637.4
high level it was so hard not to get

1635.419 --> 1640.22
distracted away

1637.4 --> 1642.44
so hard

1640.22 --> 1643.94
but you gotta keep pushing you gotta

1642.44 --> 1646.279
keep pushing it's like it doesn't even

1643.94 --> 1648.799
matter at that point if you fail as long

1646.279 --> 1651.14
as you just don't give up

1648.799 --> 1654.26
and then you eventually

1651.14 --> 1656.96
it'll happen one time and then

1654.26 --> 1658.94
you you focus a little better

1656.96 --> 1661.4
and then suddenly you can fix the

1658.94 --> 1662.659
situation where previous time you

1661.4 --> 1664.88
couldn't

1662.659 --> 1666.6200000000001
so it's like you have to go through that

1664.88 --> 1668.9
tough phase where you're getting so

1666.62 --> 1670.8799999999999
distracted while you're like

1668.9 --> 1673.46
putting your hand in that pain box it's

1670.88 --> 1677.5390000000002
like ah

1673.46 --> 1678.5
right yeah but guess what more times you

1677.539 --> 1681.74
use it

1678.5 --> 1686.299
the better you get at it

1681.74 --> 1690.2
and you have provable fruits out of

1686.299 --> 1691.8799999999999
doing that on the long run provable

1690.2 --> 1693.559
right

1691.88 --> 1695.659
anyway

1693.559 --> 1698.26
oh Jeff gashead

1695.659 --> 1698.2600000000002
see you

1703.7 --> 1706.539
what's that

1714.799 --> 1718.779
oh poof okay

1729.559 --> 1731.74
foreign

1732.24 --> 1738.61
[Music]

1743.69 --> 1760.8490000000002
[Music]

1771.94 --> 1777.3400000000001
yeah I like this I like this title

1786.159 --> 1789.7600000000002
what do you guys think

1790.46 --> 1797.059
how to transform victimhood loss into a

1794.48 --> 1799.7
challenge from God with prizes

1797.059 --> 1801.9189999999999
I mean that literally kind of sums what

1799.7 --> 1804.88
I just talked about didn't it

1801.919 --> 1804.88
sums it up

1808.94 --> 1812.6000000000001
I'm going to yeah there's a lot of

1810.919 --> 1814.3990000000001
people that have done that Jeff gas that

1812.6 --> 1816.1999999999998
we talked about it very elaborately

1814.399 --> 1818.899
yesterday

1816.2 --> 1823.3600000000001
my personal tips were

1818.899 --> 1823.36
combine Gerson Therapy

1823.46 --> 1828.5
uh with uh

1827.12 --> 1832.0
I said

1828.5 --> 1832.0
I said Lorenzo's Oil

1833.12 --> 1838.039
cannabis extract

1835.64 --> 1841.76
and maybe

1838.039 --> 1844.76
like apricot seeds on top of that

1841.76 --> 1846.94
but probably the first two would do just

1844.76 --> 1846.94
fine

1858.22 --> 1862.94
don't don't

1859.899 --> 1865.779
I don't think that that's in the picture

1862.94 --> 1865.779
yet Oz

1867.74 --> 1873.2
I don't think sister has made a decision

1869.899 --> 1875.4399999999998
yet or Fiber out is just not saying

1873.2 --> 1875.44
anything

1876.38 --> 1880.7
I don't know it could be that sisters

1878.36 --> 1882.799
literally already made every decision

1880.7 --> 1885.44
and he's just feeling really ashamed

1882.799 --> 1887.48
about it and terrified and I don't know

1885.44 --> 1889.7
I'm not very sure with fiber oats

1887.48 --> 1892.96
because he's not super forward with his

1889.7 --> 1892.96
Communications thus far

1904.1 --> 1911.9189999999999
right so she's still in the advisory

1907.82 --> 1914.9189999999999
phase right fiber Oats not literally

1911.919 --> 1918.3200000000002
enrolled in like a

1914.919 --> 1920.24
chemotherapy session the thing that I

1918.32 --> 1925.1789999999999
warned you about

1920.24 --> 1925.179
to make sure that she doesn't do that

1926.179 --> 1932.779
and like don't just let her decide that

1930.86 --> 1935.779
for herself because she suddenly has

1932.779 --> 1936.74
some female proud Pride

1935.779 --> 1938.96
like

1936.74 --> 1941.0
no

1938.96 --> 1943.3400000000001
but anyway

1941.0 --> 1945.14
yes

1943.34 --> 1948.86
what yes

1945.14 --> 1952.419
I just said like five different things

1948.86 --> 1952.4189999999999
just because so she is

1953.72 --> 1959.179
why didn't you tell her like don't do

1956.6 --> 1961.399
that it will [ __ ] destroy you it will

1959.179 --> 1963.8600000000001
destroy your brain

1961.399 --> 1966.279
you will literally not be the same

1963.86 --> 1966.279
person

1968.799 --> 1977.08
chemotherapy literally takes the spark

1972.5 --> 1977.08
of joy out of people forever

1980.179 --> 1986.8400000000001
that's not an exaggerations people

1982.76 --> 1989.3799999999999
literally testified it to that exactly

1986.84 --> 1989.3799999999999
that

1990.38 --> 1996.5
it's like it takes your soul away from

1992.96 --> 2000.039
you and you never get it back

1996.5 --> 2003.1
it's like chemically destroyed

2000.039 --> 2005.14
don't make don't do it

2003.1 --> 2007.98
it's very [ __ ] serious it's

2005.14 --> 2007.98
irreversible

2008.98 --> 2013.299
it doesn't always happens it just does

2011.799 --> 2015.82
happen

2013.299 --> 2018.22
it also [ __ ] happened to my mother

2015.82 --> 2020.74
and go [ __ ] yourself Chuck Wagner use

2018.22 --> 2023.559
[ __ ] scumbag

2020.74 --> 2026.38
this is not [ __ ] misinformation this

2023.559 --> 2027.82
is personally testified to you [ __ ]

2026.38 --> 2033.5800000000002
[ __ ]

2027.82 --> 2033.58
yeah me personal weakness [ __ ]

2034.89 --> 2038.0790000000002
[Music]

2043.14 --> 2048.0
chemotherapy is incredibly bad

2050.52 --> 2057.58
it takes the edge of the joy of a person

2054.82 --> 2059.619
like people that are radiant regular

2057.58 --> 2061.2999999999997
people doesn't really make a big

2059.619 --> 2063.52
difference

2061.3 --> 2066.3390000000004
it really it doesn't people that are

2063.52 --> 2069.28
like powerfully joyous that have that

2066.339 --> 2075.48
Radiance yeah that's the one they get

2069.28 --> 2075.48
it's stripped and you never get it back

2075.82 --> 2081.0
very [ __ ] serious

2078.22 --> 2081.0
I've seen it happen

2082.06 --> 2087.879
and I've heard other people mention that

2085.419 --> 2090.7799999999997
about their relatives and about

2087.879 --> 2090.7799999999997
themselves

2093.04 --> 2098.83
very [ __ ] serious

2097.3 --> 2102.04
foreign

2098.83 --> 2102.04
[Music]

2115.859 --> 2120.7
what are you talking about what the [ __ ]

2119.14 --> 2123.1189999999997
does that have to do with anything I

2120.7 --> 2123.1189999999997
just said

2134.859 --> 2139.0789999999997
what the [ __ ] are you talking about Jeff

2140.44 --> 2144.16
talking about chemotherapy

2144.76 --> 2150.0400000000004
chemical junk

2147.4 --> 2152.98
that turns you bold it does more than

2150.04 --> 2156.46
just turn your bald

2152.98 --> 2158.56
if you have extraordinary personal

2156.46 --> 2163.54
energy

2158.56 --> 2167.339
as a person it will strip that from you

2163.54 --> 2167.339
and you never get it back

2170.14 --> 2177.18
like you don't even get it back after 20

2172.9 --> 2177.1800000000003
years it's a one-way change

2188.92 --> 2197.079
make sure she knows fiber oats make sure

2192.579 --> 2197.079
she knows yeah

2197.26 --> 2201.7000000000003
you're all like loving her so much now

2199.599 --> 2204.6400000000003
right she's such a pillar of the family

2201.7 --> 2207.04
yeah well guess what what chemo does to

2204.64 --> 2211.24
a pillar of the family

2207.04 --> 2213.88
it totally destroys that

2211.24 --> 2216.339
I can even predict as far as that like

2213.88 --> 2219.3
families scatter because of [ __ ]

2216.339 --> 2219.2999999999997
chemo okay

2219.4 --> 2222.54
don't do it

2236.26 --> 2241.6600000000003
no not a death sentence that's not what

2238.839 --> 2244.54
I'm talking about it's not like that

2241.66 --> 2247.48
it's not a death sentence although if

2244.54 --> 2250.7799999999997
I'm not disclaiming anything about any

2247.48 --> 2253.96
lethal effects from chemo

2250.78 --> 2256.0600000000004
I'm saying it's a very specific type of

2253.96 --> 2259.3
influence

2256.06 --> 2263.92
Radiance of a person what makes people

2259.3 --> 2267.52
really like them yeah that very [ __ ]

2263.92 --> 2271.96
specific thing goes away

2267.52 --> 2274.48
not death no the radiance The Edge the

2271.96 --> 2277.66
energy that goes away it doesn't come

2274.48 --> 2281.44
back that's a [ __ ] fact

2277.66 --> 2283.839
it's a fact it's a fact a fact it always

2281.44 --> 2286.98
happens you might not take everything it

2283.839 --> 2286.98
always takes something

2287.02 --> 2293.619
it does it really [ __ ] does

2290.74 --> 2296.14
it has nothing to do with death has to

2293.619 --> 2298.119
do with their personality

2296.14 --> 2302.7999999999997
what they're like

2298.119 --> 2306.52
their social influence that is hit it's

2302.8 --> 2311.04
hit not their life that thing is hit

2306.52 --> 2311.04
people change because of it

2312.52 --> 2315.06
foreign

2316.74 --> 2321.3999999999996
you arguably

2319.06 --> 2323.14
I don't exactly know like how Rudolph

2321.4 --> 2324.64
Steiner would explain I would have to

2323.14 --> 2327.4
ask my healer like how would you

2324.64 --> 2329.859
describe that effect but I mean My

2327.4 --> 2332.079
Healer would already say like yeah it's

2329.859 --> 2335.2
just like that stuff is like one of the

2332.079 --> 2337.0600000000004
most toxic like cellular level toxic

2335.2 --> 2339.72
[ __ ]

2337.06 --> 2339.72
like it's

2340.3 --> 2347.44
it's just so incredibly poisonous stuff

2343.54 --> 2349.119
like and they do it on purpose

2347.44 --> 2351.52
because they think that by doing that

2349.119 --> 2354.76
you could just like shock the

2351.52 --> 2357.7599999999998
the body out of like the procedure of

2354.76 --> 2360.6400000000003
cancer what it is doing

2357.76 --> 2362.8590000000004
but it you yeah you could say it takes

2360.64 --> 2366.48
your soul not in a Christian perspective

2362.859 --> 2371.5
but just literally the radiance

2366.48 --> 2374.859
a palpable effect that is noticeable

2371.5 --> 2378.16
that makes people like individuals it

2374.859 --> 2380.52
goes away and it doesn't come back it's

2378.16 --> 2380.52
real

2382.8 --> 2385.8
thank you

2390.579 --> 2395.76
yeah nobody would give chemotherapy to

2392.98 --> 2395.76
absolutely

2401.04 --> 2405.2799999999997
and think of it like this it's like if

2403.599 --> 2407.079
the person is already kind of a

2405.28 --> 2410.2000000000003
measurable ass

2407.079 --> 2412.92
not very liked well then chemo is barely

2410.2 --> 2412.9199999999996
gonna make a difference

2414.46 --> 2420.099
it won't make them even worse

2417.579 --> 2422.38
well maybe if they go victims spiraling

2420.099 --> 2424.599
victimhood spiraling a lot

2422.38 --> 2427.1800000000003
but

2424.599 --> 2430.839
it's really about the people that are

2427.18 --> 2432.46
like so good to be around

2430.839 --> 2434.98
right

2432.46 --> 2438.04
and have that strong energy that that

2434.98 --> 2441.16
like give you good feelings being in

2438.04 --> 2444.119
their presence that effect is damaged

2441.16 --> 2444.1189999999997
irreparably

2444.7 --> 2449.3799999999997
it it really does that it's crazy that

2447.22 --> 2451.9599999999996
that happens but it does

2449.38 --> 2455.46
you have to take very serious it's

2451.96 --> 2455.46
something that people don't talk about

2456.28 --> 2461.02
like everybody's always like oh cancer

2458.26 --> 2463.7200000000003
oh the chance of survival they don't

2461.02 --> 2466.119
think oh yeah yeah oh but you oh we just

2463.72 --> 2468.339
have to do this to her to lower the risk

2466.119 --> 2471.1600000000003
but you're gonna lose your soul in the

2468.339 --> 2473.94
process but I mean you could die like

2471.16 --> 2473.94
what the [ __ ]

2473.98 --> 2476.98
bro

2480.46 --> 2486.94
I mean if I had my way I would literally

2483.76 --> 2488.619
forbid chemotherapy I would make it like

2486.94 --> 2491.26
forbidden

2488.619 --> 2494.32
like totally forbidden

2491.26 --> 2495.6400000000003
like that's not a legal procedure that

2494.32 --> 2497.26
you could do if you want to do that

2495.64 --> 2499.68
you'll have to do it completely

2497.26 --> 2502.599
illegally

2499.68 --> 2506.7999999999997
and you'd be [ __ ] insane to do that

2502.599 --> 2509.82
because there's so many better ways

2506.8 --> 2509.82
to deal with it

2512.5 --> 2517.48
yeah there's no other alternative

2515.079 --> 2521.5
treatment that's going to irreparably

2517.48 --> 2524.26
take your [ __ ] soul away okay there's

2521.5 --> 2527.079
no alternative treatment that does that

2524.26 --> 2530.1600000000003
zero

2527.079 --> 2530.1600000000003
chemo does

2532.119 --> 2536.44
chemical

2533.079 --> 2541.079
okay what the [ __ ] oh God I forgot about

2536.44 --> 2543.52
that one Jesus yeah chemo can also like

2541.079 --> 2545.44
seriously damage your procreation

2543.52 --> 2548.4
ability that's right

2545.44 --> 2548.4
cars

2549.339 --> 2554.74
about our goodie

2551.68 --> 2558.54
another little nice little factoid

2554.74 --> 2558.54
yeah just don't [ __ ] do it

2560.82 --> 2567.46
oh God yeah doctor yeah there's that

2565.24 --> 2570.4599999999996
yeah

2567.46 --> 2570.46
yeah chemotherapies

2570.52 --> 2574.599
it's chemical warfare therapy

2573.7 --> 2576.8799999999997
right

2574.599 --> 2579.339
I mean how ironic is it they'll say like

2576.88 --> 2581.8
oh we're doing chemical warfare on the

2579.339 --> 2584.52
on the cancer they don't tell you that

2581.8 --> 2588.28
it's actually developed and derived from

2584.52 --> 2591.22
actual lethal chemical warfare

2588.28 --> 2592.8390000000004
in World War

2591.22 --> 2596.3799999999997
it's

2592.839 --> 2597.96
this world is [ __ ] crazy man it is

2596.38 --> 2602.56
just crazy

2597.96 --> 2607.14
and it's so crazy that people just do it

2602.56 --> 2607.14
people do things without looking into it

2611.14 --> 2617.14
and that's the death like

2614.2 --> 2618.9399999999996
yeah I mean 50 years ago yeah that could

2617.14 --> 2621.0989999999997
have worked you know doing things

2618.94 --> 2624.7000000000003
without looking into it yeah that could

2621.099 --> 2625.9
have worked now it's gonna be the death

2624.7 --> 2630.0
of you

2625.9 --> 2630.0
I [ __ ] guarantee it

2630.16 --> 2637.6189999999997
if you don't look into what you're gonna

2632.2 --> 2637.6189999999997
do you could die very easily now

2642.76 --> 2648.5200000000004
because like what they offer you out

2646.18 --> 2651.7799999999997
there is just

2648.52 --> 2651.78
straight up suicide

2653.88 --> 2662.44
literally in Canada so [ __ ] up

2657.339 --> 2664.9
right but that should like that means

2662.44 --> 2669.52
when like government starts offering you

2664.9 --> 2673.98
suicide and [ __ ] well that means you you

2669.52 --> 2673.98
shouldn't actually blindly Trust

2674.74 --> 2680.14
anymore now should it because yeah

2677.8 --> 2683.7000000000003
there's literally the governing body is

2680.14 --> 2686.6189999999997
offering you to kill yourself well maybe

2683.7 --> 2687.9399999999996
maybe you shouldn't blindly trust them

2686.619 --> 2691.859
then anymore

2687.94 --> 2696.099
I don't know it's it's just a vague

2691.859 --> 2699.04
intuitive idea like not trusting people

2696.099 --> 2701.1400000000003
who literally promote suicide to you

2699.04 --> 2703.66
yeah

2701.14 --> 2707.2799999999997
that that might be

2703.66 --> 2707.2799999999997
somewhat of a good idea

2714.099 --> 2717.06
right anyway

2718.0 --> 2724.96
how to transform victimhood loss into

2720.7 --> 2726.0989999999997
Challenge from God with prizes

2724.96 --> 2729.46
yeah

2726.099 --> 2731.8590000000004
don't take the chemo

2729.46 --> 2734.14
there's no prizes

2731.859 --> 2736.96
from taking on that

2734.14 --> 2740.04
trust me there is no prizes

2736.96 --> 2740.04
only losses

2774.16 --> 2779.2599999999998
hope everybody's still here I hope I

2777.22 --> 2782.7599999999998
didn't just scare the [ __ ] out of fiber

2779.26 --> 2782.76
oats but I mean it's very serious

2784.0 --> 2791.14
it's part of the reason why I I was so

2787.54 --> 2792.7
rushed like get a grip now get a grip

2791.14 --> 2795.46
now

2792.7 --> 2798.22
because this is what they do as soon as

2795.46 --> 2801.28
Doctor find out you got cancer out there

2798.22 --> 2805.7799999999997
they literally just like

2801.28 --> 2808.9
like a missile they send out like just

2805.78 --> 2810.76
hit them with the with the chems as soon

2808.9 --> 2813.88
as possible like get the soul before

2810.76 --> 2817.599
anybody [ __ ] realize what's happening

2813.88 --> 2819.6400000000003
get it quick get them enrolled and then

2817.599 --> 2822.099
when the families made up their mind and

2819.64 --> 2824.56
done their research it's too late we got

2822.099 --> 2828.2200000000003
them and it [ __ ] ruined now

2824.56 --> 2831.339
get all their money Family blows up

2828.22 --> 2833.2
we win they lose

2831.339 --> 2835.48
that's why they do it that's why you

2833.2 --> 2838.4199999999996
gotta be [ __ ] quick it's literally

2835.48 --> 2839.859
like an assault in Wartime like you're

2838.42 --> 2843.3
suddenly getting attacked with machine

2839.859 --> 2848.22
guns you have to act immediately

2843.3 --> 2848.2200000000003
immediately are you [ __ ] die

2849.099 --> 2854.7400000000002
do not get distracted do not [ __ ]

2852.28 --> 2859.48
allow yourself in pity Cycles

2854.74 --> 2859.4799999999996
you have to take action immediately

2860.2 --> 2865.14
don't let people wonder

2868.24 --> 2874.2999999999997
take the action immediately when this

2871.72 --> 2877.4199999999996
[ __ ] happens immediately no hesitation

2874.3 --> 2879.3390000000004
no waiting no breathing period no oh I

2877.42 --> 2882.78
need to find some relief no you have to

2879.339 --> 2882.7799999999997
[ __ ] do it immediately

2886.08 --> 2889.23
[Music]

2891.119 --> 2897.94
before they yeah they get

2895.02 --> 2900.4
reeled in like a fish

2897.94 --> 2902.5
and then they'll get in the program and

2900.4 --> 2904.839
then you cannot convince them to stop

2902.5 --> 2906.7
it'll be too late and I've seen that too

2904.839 --> 2910.359
many [ __ ] times that's why I'm saying

2906.7 --> 2911.97
you have to immediately Act

2910.359 --> 2913.42
the only way

2911.97 --> 2916.9199999999996
[Music]

2913.42 --> 2916.92

it doesn't really matter just get him

2947.68 --> 2953.3799999999997

detox you get rid of it

2961.06 --> 2964.56
don't do the other stuff

2964.96 --> 2971.16
like like

2966.88 --> 2971.1600000000003
[ __ ] the tests even seriously

2975.04 --> 2980.2799999999997
it all just cause gigantic amounts of

2977.74 --> 2980.2799999999997
money anyway

2984.54 --> 2992.079
yourself the giant bills and just get

2987.76 --> 2995.2200000000003
the the cannabis extract get him some

2992.079 --> 2995.2200000000003
fruits and vegetables

2996.819 --> 3001.619
set him up with the program

2999.16 --> 3006.74
like that

3001.619 --> 3006.7400000000002
and you'll be out a lot cheaper

3010.92 --> 3016.88
yeah without any freaking side effects

3013.68 --> 3016.8799999999997
like losing your soul

3028.26 --> 3032.6400000000003
dude look

3030.66 --> 3034.0789999999997
here's what I would do and I don't think

3032.64 --> 3035.5789999999997
it's ever really gonna happen to me

3034.079 --> 3037.079
because I've been living so freaking

3035.579 --> 3040.5
healthy

3037.079 --> 3042.599
I have only a real damaging fact with me

3040.5 --> 3046.079
is stress

3042.599 --> 3048.1800000000003
because I eat really healthy

3046.079 --> 3050.28
but let's just say that I'd get like I

3048.18 --> 3053.16
noticed like whoa this is a weird lump

3050.28 --> 3058.1400000000003
here yeah what am I gonna do I'm gonna

3053.16 --> 3061.2
go to the doctor oh doctor oh no no it's

3058.14 --> 3063.44
like oh hmm

3061.2 --> 3067.819
that's not good

3063.44 --> 3067.819
right let's clean up

3068.28 --> 3073.02
like if I get a lump bite probably be

3070.68 --> 3075.0589999999997
like okay maybe I just need to stop

3073.02 --> 3077.099
smoking completely for a while maybe

3075.059 --> 3078.42
that has an idea like I'd start like

3077.099 --> 3080.76
testing

3078.42 --> 3083.579
what is the negative influence that is

3080.76 --> 3087.059
amounted to this

3083.579 --> 3089.4
yeah don't panic don't rush definitely

3087.059 --> 3093.079
don't like yeah I don't go to the doctor

3089.4 --> 3093.079
I'm not doing it anymore I don't care

3098.76 --> 3102.9
but yeah if I get some kind of a lump

3100.74 --> 3104.9399999999996
the first thing I'll do is like hey Adam

3102.9 --> 3106.92
making uh

3104.94 --> 3109.44
yeah

3106.92 --> 3111.359
I got a situation here something you can

3109.44 --> 3114.38
help me with

3111.359 --> 3114.38
that's what I do

3121.92 --> 3124.7000000000003
whoa

3125.52 --> 3129.02
he's a fighter all right

3135.119 --> 3139.38
all of a sudden a

3144.96 --> 3150.7200000000003
but it is he experiencing a drunken

3148.14 --> 3153.24
bullet like is there a lump like is he

3150.72 --> 3155.7799999999997
actually experiencing anything

3153.24 --> 3155.7799999999997
right

3157.38 --> 3161.2200000000003
I mean I've had a lot of dentists that

3159.42 --> 3163.44
told me like oh yeah you definitely go

3161.22 --> 3165.359
to cavity there and I'm like oh okay

3163.44 --> 3167.339
right

3165.359 --> 3170.16
yeah maybe like I'll make an appointment

3167.339 --> 3171.66
later or something and I would go to the

3170.16 --> 3173.339
appointment and then it's like oh no

3171.66 --> 3177.42
it's gone

3173.339 --> 3180.0
oh yeah really ah what did you just

3177.42 --> 3182.52
[ __ ] make that up then

3180.0 --> 3184.74
to get me

3182.52 --> 3186.599
rolling in there or like do you even

3184.74 --> 3189.0
know what you're doing

3186.599 --> 3191.579
maybe the cavities don't actually work

3189.0 --> 3194.48
the way they say they do it's all just

3191.579 --> 3194.48
[ __ ] nonsense

3200.7 --> 3205.3999999999996
I don't actually go to dentists anymore

3202.92 --> 3205.4
so

3212.64 --> 3215.54
nah

3217.44 --> 3222.359
as in he has no symptoms nah drunken

3220.559 --> 3225.059
bullet

3222.359 --> 3227.46
so it's just like oh the doctor just

3225.059 --> 3230.7000000000003
told him that

3227.46 --> 3233.52
going after money right well as long as

3230.7 --> 3235.859
your dad is aware of that right you can

3233.52 --> 3238.14
definitely tell him that yes they do

3235.859 --> 3241.14
actually do that especially with a

3238.14 --> 3242.819
doctors trick old people

3241.14 --> 3244.44
they do

3242.819 --> 3246.599
yeah

3244.44 --> 3248.52
I mean in the day like when my

3246.599 --> 3250.559
grandmother was alive there was issues

3248.52 --> 3253.2
with like scammers that were trying to

3250.559 --> 3256.559
get money out of her they go around and

3253.2 --> 3259.319
do that yeah well guess what yeah it's

3256.559 --> 3263.6400000000003
not just the scammers it's also [ __ ]

3259.319 --> 3265.38
medical people yes they also do that to

3263.64 --> 3269.52
old people

3265.38 --> 3271.8
it actually gets old people killed

3269.52 --> 3273.599

3299.099 --> 3304.2200000000003

3318.96 --> 3323.28
costly

3323.28 --> 3326.76
middle of nowhere and you keep to

3326.76 --> 3332.76
you're financially off the map

3329.099 --> 3335.7000000000003
almost then nobody's gonna come for you

3332.76 --> 3338.7000000000003
if you're in a system in the medical

3335.7 --> 3341.0989999999997
system if there's costs with you

3338.7 --> 3342.5989999999997

3537.38 --> 3540.92
traveler guess what

3542.22 --> 3544.8799999999997
earlier

3545.52 --> 3549.9
I had to block one try I haven't had

3547.559 --> 3551.7000000000003
much trolls recently by the way it's

3549.9 --> 3555.299
kind of nice

3551.7 --> 3558.7799999999997
but there was one troll that told me I

3555.299 --> 3560.04
was like talking medical misinfo you

3558.78 --> 3563.579
know why

3560.04 --> 3566.819
because I was telling everybody how like

3563.579 --> 3568.619
chemotherapy like makes you lose your

3566.819 --> 3570.839
soul

3568.619 --> 3573.48
he he actually thought that was medical

3570.839 --> 3576.619
misinformation

3573.48 --> 3576.619
it's hilarious

3597.119 --> 3602.7000000000003
mm-hmm

3598.88 --> 3605.359
yes it is steamy but it's not just nasty

3602.7 --> 3605.359
stuff it's

3605.52 --> 3609.839
it's like

3607.2 --> 3612.18
provably takes your soul it's just that

3609.839 --> 3613.619
what are you gonna what is the soul

3612.18 --> 3617.0
right

3613.619 --> 3617.0
in this case it's like

3618.24 --> 3622.2599999999998
it's the

3620.339 --> 3624.7799999999997
energy battery

3622.26 --> 3627.059
ability of people right you know how

3624.78 --> 3629.3390000000004
some people are just like super radiant

3627.059 --> 3630.78
and like people are attracted to that

3629.339 --> 3633.18
they're like oh I want to be close to

3630.78 --> 3637.38
this person because it's just so

3633.18 --> 3641.7
is buzzing right he or she

3637.38 --> 3644.6400000000003
well that very specific trait

3641.7 --> 3646.799
that some people have that makes them so

3644.64 --> 3649.3799999999997
great right socially

3646.799 --> 3651.18
well that exact ability is the thing

3649.38 --> 3653.94
that gets snuffed

3651.18 --> 3656.7799999999997
when they start to take chemotherapy

3653.94 --> 3656.78
that's real

3657.72 --> 3662.7
it literally takes the edge of

3660.96 --> 3665.46
somebody's spirit and there's terrible

3662.7 --> 3668.5789999999997
thing you never get it back

3665.46 --> 3671.099
so a regular person well they will have

3668.579 --> 3672.78
it too but for that it will barely be a

3671.099 --> 3673.98
difference because they're not very

3672.78 --> 3675.8390000000004
radiant

3673.98 --> 3678.119
they'll just be slightly different they

3675.839 --> 3680.4
might have some issues but like they're

3678.119 --> 3683.1600000000003
really radiant people that like keep

3680.4 --> 3685.079
families together and communities yeah

3683.16 --> 3688.339
when they do it

3685.079 --> 3691.1400000000003
they literally completely become

3688.339 --> 3693.7799999999997
unrecognizable and like communities

3691.14 --> 3697.02
break apart because people like that

3693.78 --> 3699.119
take keema literally

3697.02 --> 3700.74
I'm saying it

3699.119 --> 3703.2000000000003
because it's true

3700.74 --> 3706.04
it's very [ __ ]

3703.2 --> 3706.04
dangerous

3710.98 --> 3714.249
[Music]

3723.09 --> 3727.059

3744.82 --> 3749.26
[Music]

3754.2 --> 3761.5789999999997
it was up to me I'd literally make

3756.9 --> 3765.54
female therapy completely illegal

3761.579 --> 3767.36
I would classify it as a bio or a

3765.54 --> 3769.14
chemical hazard

3767.36 --> 3771.839
[Music]

3769.14 --> 3774.0589999999997
like it's forbidden like it's forbidden

3771.839 --> 3776.88
to have chemical weapons that's what I

3774.059 --> 3780.9
would classify chemotherapy therapy

3776.88 --> 3780.9
substance on there literally

3781.559 --> 3787.44
I would have doctors that secretly

3784.559 --> 3790.5
believe in that and keep that I would

3787.44 --> 3795.18
persecute them I would put them into

3790.5 --> 3797.339
jail over that [ __ ] yeah that's my view

3795.18 --> 3799.859
on chemotherapy I think it should be

3797.339 --> 3804.5589999999997
internationally illegal

3799.859 --> 3804.5589999999997
and classified under chemical warfare

3804.839 --> 3809.24
if you get cut you get jailed

3809.339 --> 3812.339
right

3845.22 --> 3850.64
contagious

3848.04 --> 3850.64
yeah

3851.64 --> 3854.18
whatever

3863.04 --> 3868.2599999999998
oh what is actually contagious is dark

3865.619 --> 3869.579
Spirits though dark Spirits are very

3868.26 --> 3871.559
contagious

3869.579 --> 3875.119
they will get to you and they will make

3871.559 --> 3879.059
you literally ruin yourself in your

3875.119 --> 3880.6800000000003
nihilistic escapism and euphoric

3879.059 --> 3883.7400000000002
it is here

3880.68 --> 3887.7
whatever the [ __ ] you want to do

3883.74 --> 3889.9799999999996
drugs and and sex in the nasty ways and

3887.7 --> 3892.5
yeah that'll literally completely [ __ ]

3889.98 --> 3895.859
you up it will literally eject the

3892.5 --> 3898.14
spirit of your body and

3895.859 --> 3900.24
and then you get very seriously sick

3898.14 --> 3904.7
from that

3900.24 --> 3904.7
because it's all so unnatural so

3905.359 --> 3909.319
unhealthy and Escapist

3910.02 --> 3913.099
and that makes you sick

3913.43 --> 3919.7599999999998
[Music]

3914.76 --> 3919.76
yeah it's behavior that makes you sick

3920.04 --> 3925.38
if you accept it

3923.04 --> 3926.64
that behavior if you want to be part of

3925.38 --> 3928.859
that

3926.64 --> 3931.74
you will get sick

3928.859 --> 3934.14
but it's not infectious as in a

3931.74 --> 3936.74
biological infection it's a spiritual

3934.14 --> 3936.74
affection

3937.38 --> 3945.02
if you start resonating with what they

3940.559 --> 3945.02
do all those terrible disgusting things

3945.48 --> 3950.16
then you get it too

3947.579 --> 3953.1600000000003
not because you're biologically infected

3950.16 --> 3955.68
but because you're spiritually infected

3953.16 --> 3958.5589999999997
because that's the cause of it

3955.68 --> 3960.54
doing unnatural things and destroying

3958.559 --> 3964.3390000000004
your body for pleasure

3960.54 --> 3964.339
that's what gets you that sick

[Music]

3972.559 --> 3978.7200000000003
yeah and if you don't on top of that

3975.839 --> 3980.339
start taking disgusting weird chemicals

3978.72 --> 3982.319
and [ __ ] because your doctor tells you

3980.339 --> 3985.2599999999998
you got something yeah then

3982.319 --> 3987.119
it maximizes the damage because you're

3985.26 --> 3990.619
already kind of compromised and weakened

3987.119 --> 3990.619
from your terrible activities

4026.619 --> 4034.039
very old people it's absolutely insane

4031.339 --> 4035.59
to do anything anything like that with

4034.039 --> 4038.639
old people

4035.59 --> 4038.639
[Music]

4041.24 --> 4049.1189999999997
I mean how many old people actually die

4044.119 --> 4049.119
from cancer like actually die from it

4055.64 --> 4059.5389999999998
how many old people you're just like oh

4057.74 --> 4061.52
they get cancer and they're like oh no

4059.539 --> 4063.7400000000002
I'm too old or this or that I'm deciding

4061.52 --> 4065.66
to just let it happen and they'll still

4063.74 --> 4067.9599999999996
live for freaking 20 years with that

4065.66 --> 4067.96
[ __ ]

4068.72 --> 4073.5789999999997
yeah why

4070.819 --> 4076.2799999999997
why because they chose not to completely

4073.579 --> 4077.96
destroy themselves with the highly

4076.28 --> 4082.099
invasive

4077.96 --> 4084.2
chemical warfare based treatments

4082.099 --> 4086.539
for something that technically isn't

4084.2 --> 4090.3999999999996
even that much of a hazard

4086.539 --> 4090.4
it's part of your body's function

4101.96 --> 4107.0
but the cool thing with like Lorenzo's

4104.359 --> 4109.6990000000005
Oil and all that is that it works at any

4107.0 --> 4111.38
age when you're very old it also works

4109.699 --> 4114.0199999999995
fantastically

4111.38 --> 4117.14
dude you could have literal like heavy

4114.02 --> 4120.040000000001
Rejuvenation effects even from it

4117.14 --> 4120.04
from cannabis

4122.48 --> 4126.919999999999
they just have to like be able to

4124.58 --> 4129.859
tolerate the highs because you do get

4126.92 --> 4132.04
really freaking high from like Lorenzo's

4129.859 --> 4132.04
Oil

4132.259 --> 4137.299
but you just have to you have to solder

4134.779 --> 4140.0
it up you just have to do that because

4137.299 --> 4142.339
it's gonna have a prize you're gonna

4140.0 --> 4144.739
have a prize for doing that can just be

4142.339 --> 4147.799
I don't like it I wanna [ __ ] die you

4144.739 --> 4151.459999999999
[ __ ] face go to chemo then you [ __ ]

4147.799 --> 4155.12
idiot no just deal with it

4151.46 --> 4157.64
deal with the highs yeah

4155.12 --> 4159.739
just gotta do it

4157.64 --> 4162.5
because you want to live and you want to

4159.739 --> 4165.5
be rejuvenated after and not completely

4162.5 --> 4165.5
demolished

4166.699 --> 4173.299
yeah getting high from Lorenzo's all

4170.0 --> 4175.94
doesn't actually damage you it's just

4173.299 --> 4179.06
kind of unnerving and uncomfortable for

4175.94 --> 4182.66
some people that is it it never does

4179.06 --> 4184.88
damage it never even influences you

4182.66 --> 4188.54
negatively

4184.88 --> 4190.52
on the long run only in the moment any

4188.54 --> 4194.78
discomfort you get from Cannabis

4190.52 --> 4198.46
influences is only in the moment

4194.78 --> 4201.44
it's famous for how

4198.46 --> 4204.02
non-dangerous it is as a substance it's

4201.44 --> 4206.299999999999
like the substance you literally cannot

4204.02 --> 4209.2390000000005
over those arms one of the few drugs

4206.3 --> 4211.34
that you can literally not overdose on

4209.239 --> 4213.44
okay

4211.34 --> 4214.88
this is why it's even classified as soft

4213.44 --> 4217.219
Drive

4214.88 --> 4220.58
doesn't mean that you don't experience

4217.219 --> 4222.7390000000005
some discomfort or matter of perspective

4220.58 --> 4226.159
because you're not used to hot highs and

4222.739 --> 4228.379999999999
it's like uh weird yeah yeah well you

4226.159 --> 4231.759999999999
will actually rejuvenate it will not

4228.38 --> 4233.38
leave any damage it will not leave any

4231.76 --> 4236.6
freaky

4233.38 --> 4238.84
personality alteration and it will cure

4236.6 --> 4238.84
you

4240.02 --> 4242.02
um

4242.36 --> 4247.46
germinal medicine oh okay

4245.0 --> 4249.92
thanks for that

4247.46 --> 4252.219
it's okay yeah it's okay you posted that

4249.92 --> 4252.219
I guess

4252.8 --> 4258.38
German or medicine is always interesting

4256.04 --> 4259.94
right because that's terminal medicine

4258.38 --> 4263.2390000000005
is really good

4259.94 --> 4265.339999999999
for the alternative

4263.239 --> 4268.699
insight

4265.34 --> 4271.28
on how these diseases actually work in

4268.699 --> 4273.739
our body what the Cycles are where are

4271.28 --> 4276.259999999999
they coming from

4273.739 --> 4277.759999999999
and the realization that most of it is

4276.26 --> 4279.4400000000005
really spiritual

4277.76 --> 4281.719
in origin

4279.44 --> 4284.54
when you get an issue

4281.719 --> 4285.86
it's usually because something that

4284.54 --> 4288.44
happened

4285.86 --> 4291.0199999999995
that made an impact on you

4288.44 --> 4293.0
and that you then resolved

4291.02 --> 4295.88
like you

4293.0 --> 4299.12
you assimilate it you you you grew with

4295.88 --> 4302.2390000000005
it and you fixed it well then you get an

4299.12 --> 4304.699
after effect that correlates

4302.239 --> 4306.5599999999995
directly with the region you're gonna

4304.699 --> 4308.239
have issues with

4306.56 --> 4311.1990000000005
and there's a map for that the German

4308.239 --> 4311.199
new medicine map

4315.739 --> 4320.959999999999
it's very fascinating

4318.44 --> 4322.879999999999
right I'm not even too concerned with

4320.96 --> 4325.34
like the map or anything you're like oh

4322.88 --> 4327.08
this and that you'll get some good

4325.34 --> 4328.52
indication from that it's like oh I

4327.08 --> 4330.679
always have issues here well that's

4328.52 --> 4333.38
telling something then literally it's

4330.679 --> 4335.3
like it's a message

4333.38 --> 4337.58
you can help decide for that message

4335.3 --> 4340.2390000000005
through Germany medicine

4337.58 --> 4340.239
for the map

4341.36 --> 4348.0199999999995
right but the most important thing is is

4343.58 --> 4351.86
that you don't ever see your diseases or

4348.02 --> 4355.280000000001
whatever or your symptoms as like oh no

4351.86 --> 4358.099999999999
it's in like my body's breaking down or

4355.28 --> 4362.0199999999995
I'm getting attacked from the outside by

4358.1 --> 4362.02
some Micro Entity right

4363.199 --> 4368.54
because those ideas are literally

4366.92 --> 4370.76
negative on you

4368.54 --> 4375.159
like they are counterproductive for your

4370.76 --> 4375.159000000001
own health and they are untrue

4377.239 --> 4383.78
and German new medicine can help you

4380.06 --> 4386.3
realize and take control of that

4383.78 --> 4389.659
and it has with me

4386.3 --> 4391.719
it can help you basically

4389.659 --> 4395.299999999999
push off

4391.719 --> 4396.9800000000005
the the fearful Reliance on the medical

4395.3 --> 4398.84
experts

4396.98 --> 4402.44
out there

4398.84 --> 4404.06
is it like like oh but it's so big I

4402.44 --> 4406.46
don't know what else to do well German

4404.06 --> 4409.04
romance Basics is like yeah that's all

4406.46 --> 4411.8
horseshit

4409.04 --> 4414.56
like the entire upper it's it's so

4411.8 --> 4417.1990000000005
counter opposite to allopathic medical

4414.56 --> 4419.659000000001
thinking it's like the direct

4417.199 --> 4422.178999999999
opposition it's almost like a mirror

4419.659 --> 4425.48
image opposition it's so crazy

4422.179 --> 4428.96
would it really helped me to like like

4425.48 --> 4430.94
really throw off the hooks like really

4428.96 --> 4433.4
get that medical

4430.94 --> 4436.58
dependency idea and that I need a

4433.4 --> 4440.239
medical assist to get that off of me

4436.58 --> 4442.82
to always become self-reliant

4440.239 --> 4444.259999999999
purely self-reliant even in in heavy

4442.82 --> 4446.179
situations even like oh there's

4444.26 --> 4448.88
something coming oh no

4446.179 --> 4452.2390000000005
it's worse than not to to panic never

4448.88 --> 4454.82
Panic ever ever ever No matter how

4452.239 --> 4460.218999999999
painful it is no matter how sudden it is

4454.82 --> 4466.239
no matter how unnerving it is never ever

4460.219 --> 4466.2390000000005
panic and then surrender to some expert

4466.4 --> 4472.58
always be the one to figure it out like

4470.719 --> 4474.76
why is it there what is it what's going

4472.58 --> 4474.76
on

4476.239 --> 4479.239
anyway

4487.04 --> 4489.219

4609.02 --> 4612.52
stop feeling so

4613.34 --> 4616.34
dreamy

oh by the way let me give you an update

4640.34 --> 4646.06
on my uh

4642.14 --> 4646.06
on my mint plant I think just

4651.26 --> 4658.780000000001
just look at this look at that

4655.28 --> 4658.78
isn't that just amazing

4663.88 --> 4672.32
looks like a giant mint fractal

4668.179 --> 4675.679
there's like art like just these tops

4672.32 --> 4677.36
here are crazy like there's an armpit an

4675.679 --> 4679.52
armpit an arm it's like it just keeps

4677.36 --> 4680.599999999999
going it's just branching off like a

4679.52 --> 4684.52
fractal

4680.6 --> 4684.52
this one too it's amazing

4688.21 --> 4693.64
[Music]

4689.62 --> 4693.64
look at this oops

4699.699 --> 4703.82
then you have this thing on the frontier

4702.26 --> 4706.96
look at that

4703.82 --> 4706.96
climbing out

4710.12 --> 4715.54
smells nice too

4712.04 --> 4715.54
but yeah it's doing great

4725.48 --> 4729.799999999999
it's not having any problem with the

4727.64 --> 4735.04
Wind

4729.8 --> 4735.04
hey arenakobomo Luna loves you

4744.14 --> 4749.360000000001
okay

4744.88 --> 4751.28
well you might simply not really be I'm

4749.36 --> 4754.219
not saying that you can never be happy

4751.28 --> 4756.679
again after you had chemo

4754.219 --> 4760.4
what I'm saying is it takes the edge

4756.679 --> 4763.58
away it literally like dampens the power

4760.4 --> 4765.379999999999
they have the social power they have

4763.58 --> 4768.88
and they never get it back that doesn't

4765.38 --> 4768.88
mean that they're in like

4771.92 --> 4777.679
they can still like learn to accept it

4774.679 --> 4780.08
and then still be it a little bit

4777.679 --> 4781.6990000000005
they're just not as strong anymore it

4780.08 --> 4783.08
never comes back that was kind of the

4781.699 --> 4786.0199999999995
point

4783.08 --> 4788.659
and if you're really like leaning on

4786.02 --> 4790.76
that power for yourself and you then

4788.659 --> 4792.739
[ __ ] lose it then your [ __ ] life

4790.76 --> 4794.719
is destroyed

4792.739 --> 4798.759999999999
and potentially everybody that was

4794.719 --> 4798.76
leaning on you that was my point

4810.81 --> 4816.159000000001
[Music]

4812.14 --> 4816.159000000001
just don't take it

4818.06 --> 4823.6
never

4820.54 --> 4823.6
[Music]

4849.56 --> 4855.080000000001
mint is an invasive species yeah what I

4853.159 --> 4858.259999999999
mean it's one of the better ones

4855.08 --> 4860.78
I like it I mean how cool is it there's

4858.26 --> 4862.52
a plant that's like a weed and you can

4860.78 --> 4865.159
just eat it

4862.52 --> 4867.38
it's awesome

4865.159 --> 4870.679
those are the best plants like let the

4867.38 --> 4873.58
world be filled with it

4870.679 --> 4873.58
right

4884.9 --> 4890.44
all right drunken Bowl you have a good

4886.46 --> 4890.44

foreign

4945.48 --> 4948.69
[Music]

4952.82 --> 4955.82
right

4959.0 --> 4963.98
okay yeah I'm kind of done talking about

4961.1 --> 4968.1990000000005
this freaking chemo [ __ ]

4963.98 --> 4968.199
it's it's gross

4968.96 --> 4973.4
and hey I'm sure there's some people

4971.48 --> 4974.839999999999
that have taken it that got out of it

4973.4 --> 4976.759999999999
and they're like oh well everything

4974.84 --> 4980.1990000000005
seems fine

4976.76 --> 4980.1990000000005
yeah well I've seen like

4980.659 --> 4988.58
important people like Cornerstone people

4985.64 --> 4990.7390000000005
take it and then lose their Edge lose

4988.58 --> 4992.719
their power change

4990.739 --> 4996.759999999999
and like changing the way that they lose

4992.719 --> 4996.76
their power and realize it

5004.3 --> 5010.679
it's something that I wish to prevent

5006.699 --> 5010.678999999999
happening with anybody I can

5018.94 --> 5021.178999999999
foreign

5046.38 --> 5052.659000000001
right what else can I talk about

5049.659 --> 5055.0599999999995
our own Benjamin I I noticed that he had

5052.659 --> 5057.879999999999
a Saturday stream

5055.06 --> 5059.620000000001
I might have actually watched that

5057.88 --> 5061.659000000001
while it was happening and then I

5059.62 --> 5063.04
completely forgot about it that I

5061.659 --> 5064.78
watched it

5063.04 --> 5066.76
weird

5064.78 --> 5071.98
because it was such a long story it's

5066.76 --> 5071.9800000000005
like a four hour 23 minutes Jesus

5074.739 --> 5079.08
so apparently it's like one after the

5076.96 --> 5079.08
other

5080.14 --> 5086.02
now pull from pockets of the future we

5083.32 --> 5088.84
which he always likes to talk about so

5086.02 --> 5091.679
much now is basically starting to Go

5088.84 --> 5091.679
Gamma on him

5092.62 --> 5097.36
but really dude like even with this

5094.659 --> 5100.0599999999995
Curtis Stone guy like

5097.36 --> 5102.339999999999
when I was when home Benjamin was like

5100.06 --> 5104.26
first on D like that big there and

5102.34 --> 5105.58
eventually got kicked off like I got on

5104.26 --> 5107.4400000000005
there and like through his

5105.58 --> 5108.82
recommendation like went to Curtis town

5107.44 --> 5113.08
like

5108.82 --> 5115.48
this is the farmer whatever Urban Farmer

5113.08 --> 5116.62
I watched like five minutes and then it

5115.48 --> 5120.099999999999
was like

5116.62 --> 5122.38
why the [ __ ] are you recommending that

5120.1 --> 5125.02
[ __ ]

5122.38 --> 5128.14
why

5125.02 --> 5129.9400000000005
like I just think that oh I am really

5128.14 --> 5131.7390000000005
starting to wonder if he just picked all

5129.94 --> 5133.54
these people out supposedly to be

5131.739 --> 5136.659
friends so that he could burn them later

5133.54 --> 5139.12
because he know he he knew he they were

5136.659 --> 5141.82
gonna spaz out on him

5139.12 --> 5144.159
is he just playing everybody

5141.82 --> 5146.199
is Owen Benjamin literally just playing

5144.159 --> 5150.839999999999
the field

5146.199 --> 5150.839999999999
or tilling the field as you if you will

5151.36 --> 5155.62
and I mean

5153.159 --> 5159.339999999999
I'm not even gonna speak out against it

5155.62 --> 5161.98
I'm like that's just fine I'm just like

5159.34 --> 5164.1990000000005
weirded out that he originally like

5161.98 --> 5166.839999999999
thought like oh these are great guys and

5164.199 --> 5171.339999999999
I'm like what the [ __ ] is wrong with you

5166.84 --> 5173.679
Owen Benjamin these are not great guys

5171.34 --> 5176.9800000000005
they're deranged they're like [ __ ]

5173.679 --> 5179.26
annoying and Tweaky and like don't have

5176.98 --> 5183.58
good energy like why the [ __ ] are you

5179.26 --> 5185.62
even interested in that I don't get it

5183.58 --> 5186.96
and now they're all turning on and I'm

5185.62 --> 5189.58
like yeah

5186.96 --> 5193.8
what the [ __ ] did you expect you idiot

5189.58 --> 5193.8
but now I'm thinking like well maybe

5193.9 --> 5199.239
maybe kind of did it on purpose maybe

5196.0 --> 5201.58
just like befriended all them just so he

5199.239 --> 5203.32
could have them grow up go berserk on

5201.58 --> 5206.699
his ass

5203.32 --> 5206.699
so we'd have clout

5208.36 --> 5212.159
Robert what did he do

5212.26 --> 5217.179
where do I watch Owen these days or I

5215.08 --> 5220.0599999999995
watch him live on D live

5217.179 --> 5221.32
and then uh yeah d-life doesn't keep

5220.06 --> 5224.139
their streams

5221.32 --> 5227.08
and so you can actually keep

5224.139 --> 5229.56
the archive is at bitued I'll link you

5227.08 --> 5229.5599999999995
up on that

5232.179 --> 5237.06
what did he do who what did who do

5234.52 --> 5237.06
exactly

5239.139 --> 5243.1
Owen

5241.36 --> 5248.259999999999
okay

5243.1 --> 5251.139
well he's just having like a gamma week

5248.26 --> 5253.42
the first uh Urban Farmer Curtis Stone

5251.139 --> 5256.659000000001
just when he came on with him and then

5253.42 --> 5258.76
went complete ape [ __ ] gamma

5256.659 --> 5260.86
like totally out of my out of his mind

5258.76 --> 5261.76
like you should check that out by the

5260.86 --> 5265.179
way

5261.76 --> 5269.139
which one is that uh

5265.179 --> 5269.139
yes episode 1771.

5270.58 --> 5276.94
crack snake and moan

5273.42 --> 5278.7390000000005
rage quits that thing is just like what

5276.94 --> 5280.839999999999
the [ __ ]

5278.739 --> 5282.82
because he does that [ __ ] on cameras

5280.84 --> 5286.0
like

5282.82 --> 5287.38
what the [ __ ] is wrong with you you

5286.0 --> 5288.699
spazz

5287.38 --> 5290.9800000000005
I mean

5288.699 --> 5292.419999999999
you think that people go crazy on the

5290.98 --> 5294.879999999999
Flat Earth debates when they're like

5292.42 --> 5297.1
anti-flat Earth but this guy is just

5294.88 --> 5299.26
what the [ __ ]

5297.1 --> 5301.38
I've never seen such a gamma squirt like

5299.26 --> 5301.38
that

5304.3 --> 5307.2390000000005
gym up started out with good energy then

5306.219 --> 5307.9
partial

5307.239 --> 5310.78
um

5307.9 --> 5313.36
there's a point there slo-mo

5310.78 --> 5315.4
but hey I made an offer to Jim Bob right

5313.36 --> 5317.5599999999995
I did it I addressed him yesterday for a

5315.4 --> 5320.08
bit and wasn't in the title

5317.56 --> 5323.4400000000005
what I mean is like dude let it [ __ ]

5320.08 --> 5326.199
go go back to how you started like

5323.44 --> 5328.36
stop pretending like you're like such a

5326.199 --> 5331.138999999999
big figure or such an important figure

5328.36 --> 5331.139
and like

5333.46 --> 5339.639
just let it go and start a new like just

5337.0 --> 5342.4
like a new little Sprout Sprout like

5339.639 --> 5345.42
just start over be funny again make Jim

5342.4 --> 5345.42
Bob funny again

5347.199 --> 5352.86
right yeah Curtis is never gonna do that

5349.239 --> 5352.86
by the way because he is just

5352.9 --> 5356.339999999999
that guy's out of his mind

5357.94 --> 5362.159
Curtis are holding up his Coke mirror

5364.71 --> 5368.44
[Music]

5366.28 --> 5371.94
yeah

5368.44 --> 5371.94
it was surreal

5373.54 --> 5378.639
and like making the jacking off motions

5375.94 --> 5382.44
all the time it was so [ __ ] up man

5378.639 --> 5382.4400000000005
I mean he was so [ __ ] up

5392.02 --> 5394.080000000001
um

5397.3 --> 5402.34
right so yeah that happened Curtis Stone

5399.82 --> 5404.86
and now Paul from pockets is sort of

5402.34 --> 5407.8
going after him and he's

5404.86 --> 5409.48
pointing out how much he sucks or in

5407.8 --> 5411.820000000001
what's good about him and what's stupid

5409.48 --> 5414.099999999999
about him and he's apparently Owen is

5411.82 --> 5416.4
very entertained by Paul from pockets of

5414.1 --> 5416.400000000001
the future

5417.699 --> 5423.46
I am not impressed

5420.159 --> 5425.92
like I just like I don't get it man

5423.46 --> 5427.78
maybe it's just like Owen is just too

5425.92 --> 5430.659
much of a people person

5427.78 --> 5432.699
and I'm just not I'm just like

5430.659 --> 5435.239
it's a [ __ ] waste of time

5432.699 --> 5435.239
like

5437.92 --> 5440.82
I don't get it

5445.3 --> 5449.7390000000005
oh you actually did watch him

5447.76 --> 5454.2390000000005
because apparently he does have some

5449.739 --> 5458.159
really good like specialist data on

5454.239 --> 5458.159
certain things good tricks

5458.38 --> 5463.36
I I wouldn't be able to sit through all

5460.96 --> 5465.659
that just to get those tricks like I

5463.36 --> 5465.659
just

5466.6 --> 5469.6
foreign

5471.48 --> 5476.379999999999
maybe like in a one-on-one conversation

5474.159 --> 5479.92
so I could literally just straight out

5476.38 --> 5482.32
ask the questions right

5479.92 --> 5484.06
like the questions that I want because I

5482.32 --> 5487.179
got a feeling he's a guy that like has

5484.06 --> 5489.88
to explain things at his own pace I

5487.179 --> 5492.04
absolutely have no patience for people

5489.88 --> 5494.38
that do that

5492.04 --> 5497.0199999999995
it's like no I'm gonna ask you the

5494.38 --> 5501.719
questions and you have to answer them

5497.02 --> 5501.719
immediately not at your own pace

5504.1 --> 5510.58
say the things and then you can like

5507.88 --> 5514.08
explain it your version afterward I need

5510.58 --> 5514.08
the answers first though

5514.719 --> 5520.719
too depressing too fearful right

5518.38 --> 5523.139
and why the [ __ ] would you want to sit

5520.719 --> 5523.139
through that

5524.86 --> 5530.5
I mean I'm just I guess I'm just really

5527.92 --> 5533.9800000000005
glad that I'm not like that

5530.5 --> 5536.199
I mean yeah I can get kind of ragey I

5533.98 --> 5537.759999999999
can give you a pretty dark look on the

5536.199 --> 5541.299999999999
world right

5537.76 --> 5544.96
but do I not at the same time as I

5541.3 --> 5547.2390000000005
unveil the horrifying Darkness I also

5544.96 --> 5550.78
reveal that there's also the blinding

5547.239 --> 5552.638999999999
light right beside that right I always

5550.78 --> 5555.5199999999995
do that right

5552.639 --> 5557.62
it's never just Doom except maybe for

5555.52 --> 5559.659000000001
like what the hell do we do about this

5557.62 --> 5561.699
[ __ ] political situation then

5559.659 --> 5563.44
everybody's just oh pointing at it like

5561.699 --> 5566.759999999999
oh they're doing it wrong and I'm like

5563.44 --> 5566.759999999999
yeah no [ __ ] Sherlock

5566.92 --> 5575.02
how are we gonna actually stop it though

5571.0 --> 5577.54
and not have it take 20 years in which

5575.02 --> 5580.900000000001
they can just wreck everything even more

5577.54 --> 5583.32
in those in all that time like

5580.9 --> 5583.32
yeah

5583.78 --> 5587.62
but it's because I genuinely don't

5585.76 --> 5590.7390000000005
really know

5587.62 --> 5594.219
what to do about it

5590.739 --> 5596.739
but in my general world view I I never

5594.219 --> 5599.5
leave things unbalanced and that's why

5596.739 --> 5602.379999999999
the way goes Bose goes both ways yeah

5599.5 --> 5605.199
it's not just oh I'll give you something

5602.38 --> 5607.78
positive beside the native no no I'll do

5605.199 --> 5610.48
the same thing if I'll never leave give

5607.78 --> 5613.5
you some Heavenly View and then not

5610.48 --> 5613.5
telling you the price

5613.78 --> 5617.4
because there's always a price

5618.46 --> 5625.08
and I've learned to stop pretending like

5621.94 --> 5625.08
like there isn't

5625.239 --> 5629.138999999999
with anything anyway

5629.44 --> 5633.419999999999
and I'm definitely not fearful right

5657.88 --> 5662.79
right come on slo-mo

5661.06 --> 5665.9490000000005
this is terrible

5662.79 --> 5665.949
[Music]

5673.719 --> 5679.56
somebody say something besides me

5682.0 --> 5687.96
we actively look at Solutions yes

5684.34 --> 5687.96
exactly well said

5696.699 --> 5702.339999999999
right because it's like a system it's a

5700.12 --> 5704.28
system that we use it's like don't bring

5702.34 --> 5707.9800000000005
anything up

5704.28 --> 5711.46
unless there's something good you could

5707.98 --> 5714.28
get out of it like a solution uh

5711.46 --> 5716.52
an opportunity something right don't

5714.28 --> 5719.98
just like

5716.52 --> 5722.26
like never I that I just immediately

5719.98 --> 5723.94
laugh at that and say like oh somebody's

5722.26 --> 5727.06
squirting

5723.94 --> 5729.04
unless they're like just had a really

5727.06 --> 5731.8
terrible news about a death or something

5729.04 --> 5734.76
I mean then you're definitely forgiven

5731.8 --> 5734.76
that's but

5742.48 --> 5748.08
it's not a habit it's not something we

5745.3 --> 5748.08
make fun of

5750.1 --> 5757.02
like that it's not funny when people are

5753.04 --> 5757.0199999999995
like in a downward spiral like that

5757.36 --> 5762.699
but also like it needs to be halted it's

5760.48 --> 5764.86
like when people downward spiral don't

5762.699 --> 5768.178999999999
leave them to just down Wells Fargo you

5764.86 --> 5768.179
gotta say tell them to stop

5768.48 --> 5773.919999999999
right because if nobody tells a

5771.219 --> 5778.08
downworld spiraling person stop

5773.92 --> 5778.08
they will literally like go to hell

5779.139 --> 5783.34
that literally happens to people that

5781.06 --> 5787.780000000001
are in a dumb World spiral

5783.34 --> 5792.400000000001
I know it works like that because I went

5787.78 --> 5795.159
through that and exactly that happened

5792.4 --> 5799.299999999999
where I was like demonstratively like

5795.159 --> 5801.5199999999995
I'm doing freaky [ __ ] I'm I'm like very

5799.3 --> 5805.54
clearly hanging out with people that are

5801.52 --> 5809.080000000001
very bad and unreliable and dangerous

5805.54 --> 5813.88
and I'm like challenging my family to

5809.08 --> 5815.679
[ __ ] take notice and say something

5813.88 --> 5818.62
about it

5815.679 --> 5820.0
and they didn't guess what happens it

5818.62 --> 5821.5599999999995
gets worse

5820.0 --> 5823.719
and worse

5821.56 --> 5824.92
because it is basically a form of like

5823.719 --> 5826.36
attention

5824.92 --> 5830.08
seeking

5826.36 --> 5832.839999999999
but not just but it's serious it's not

5830.08 --> 5834.4
just in the moment or something like oh

5832.84 --> 5835.54
I needed attention right now it's not

5834.4 --> 5838.54
just

5835.54 --> 5841.3
like a social addiction it's like a very

5838.54 --> 5842.38
serious situation I'm like I I am doing

5841.3 --> 5846.6
something

5842.38 --> 5848.88
I need you to take notice

5846.6 --> 5851.56
and tell me

5848.88 --> 5853.06
communicate with me and then when they

5851.56 --> 5854.92
don't well guess what's gonna happen

5853.06 --> 5858.280000000001
then

5854.92 --> 5862.139
it's gonna be even worse until you

5858.28 --> 5862.139
finally [ __ ] say something

5862.659 --> 5865.138999999999
right

5865.659 --> 5869.98
so if people like are caught in some

5868.239 --> 5872.98
kind of spiral

5869.98 --> 5872.98
like

5873.46 --> 5878.7390000000005
and you care about them

5875.679 --> 5881.6990000000005
stop them tell them they what are you

5878.739 --> 5881.699
doing that's not good

5882.34 --> 5890.76
you need to talk about it

5885.58 --> 5890.76
don't shame him right just like be open

5891.639 --> 5897.04
but stop them because if you don't stop

5895.12 --> 5900.78
people that are in a downward spiral

5897.04 --> 5900.78
like they're gonna get even worse

5901.179 --> 5904.719
right

5902.199 --> 5906.879999999999
so unless they're like gamma's on

5904.719 --> 5907.84
purpose doing that just to manipulate

5906.88 --> 5909.9400000000005
you

5907.84 --> 5912.159000000001
because they don't actually care they're

5909.94 --> 5914.199
just like gammas

5912.159 --> 5915.46
so they're manipulating everybody they

5914.199 --> 5919.599999999999
don't actually care about anything

5915.46 --> 5921.78
except for winning whatever getting the

5919.6 --> 5921.780000000001
numbers

5921.82 --> 5926.08
yeah then you should absolutely ignore

5924.28 --> 5927.639
them when they're spiraling out of

5926.08 --> 5930.219
control

5927.639 --> 5932.92
but when it's regular people or like

5930.219 --> 5936.04
your family your kids

5932.92 --> 5938.58
never just let them spiral it's very

5936.04 --> 5938.58
dangerous

5938.679 --> 5943.0
I've been through that is very freaking

5940.96 --> 5946.06
dangerous I ended up in circles that

5943.0 --> 5950.699
were like where I literally wasn't way

5946.06 --> 5950.6990000000005
over my head that's what happens

5952.06 --> 5957.219
when you let somebody spiral

5955.42 --> 5960.34
they go places where they could

5957.219 --> 5962.5
potentially like really risk things

5960.34 --> 5964.179
and that risk is gonna rub off on

5962.5 --> 5967.0
everybody

5964.179 --> 5968.92
it's like if you don't fix somebody in

5967.0 --> 5971.5
your family that's goes spiraling out of

5968.92 --> 5973.4800000000005
control they will attract damage and

5971.5 --> 5976.659
then they will bring damage to the

5973.48 --> 5979.5
family because of your ignorance

5976.659 --> 5979.5
that's what happens

5984.28 --> 5989.44
grow pointing to the solution 2021 by

5987.699 --> 5992.138999999999
not participating in the fear Pro yes

5989.44 --> 5993.339999999999
indeed we were a lot of people by the

5992.139 --> 5997.1990000000005
way here

5993.34 --> 5997.1990000000005
most of us dare I say

5998.56 --> 6003.84
but I mean

6000.54 --> 6005.699
if you're into Flat Earth you've gone

6003.84 --> 6008.28
there

6005.699 --> 6011.46
you'd have to be a real serious weirdo

6008.28 --> 6014.94
to not realize

6011.46 --> 6017.659
like the the whole medical situation is

6014.94 --> 6017.659
all fiction

6018.42 --> 6022.56
I've never met a flat Earth that I

6020.34 --> 6024.32
actually believed in covet and all that

6022.56 --> 6027.5
have you guys

6024.32 --> 6027.5
I haven't

6029.219 --> 6034.86
some Ballers maybe but I haven't met a

6033.0 --> 6037.32
single flat earther that actually was

6034.86 --> 6042.739
like yeah no no we should definitely get

6037.32 --> 6042.739
the shot no I haven't seen a single one

6045.0 --> 6052.34
unless you count ranty but yeah that's

6047.82 --> 6052.34
that wasn't really a flatter anymore

6061.4 --> 6069.48
somebody say something

6065.159 --> 6072.799999999999
now these five minute breaks

6069.48 --> 6072.799999999999
in between everything

6076.92 --> 6081.12
2020 brought you to Flat Earth

6079.38 --> 6083.84
yeah how did that happen by the way

6081.12 --> 6083.84
Richard G

6084.54 --> 6087.98
I'd love to hear about it

6089.719 --> 6095.94
you're just one Fe guy that fell into

6093.239 --> 6098.419999999999
the television probe again wow really

6095.94 --> 6098.419999999999
who

6101.84 --> 6105.08
was that

6110.219 --> 6119.28
uh

6111.64 --> 6119.280000000001
[Music]

6121.88 --> 6130.139
was it like what's Flat Earth poker was

6125.58 --> 6132.78
he like had he Fallen I'm not sure but

6130.139 --> 6135.84
I think he did

6132.78 --> 6137.28
Green Thumb bear oh okay don't know who

6135.84 --> 6139.26
that is

6137.28 --> 6142.32
but I thought that like Flat Earth

6139.26 --> 6145.02
Folker did actually fall for the covet

6142.32 --> 6147.0599999999995
[ __ ] a bit or like he tried not to but

6145.02 --> 6149.280000000001
he was just so afraid

6147.06 --> 6151.860000000001
that a lot of people suspect that he did

6149.28 --> 6156.0199999999995
actually get the shot

6151.86 --> 6156.0199999999995
not too long before he died

6163.44 --> 6168.78
so yeah it's not not everybody was

6166.679 --> 6172.8
completely

6168.78 --> 6175.219
immediately on board with that it's all

6172.8 --> 6175.219
fake

6175.44 --> 6181.138999999999
and some of them that didn't well they

6177.84 --> 6183.7390000000005
bought it now did they now didn't they

6181.139 --> 6183.7390000000005
so

6190.39 --> 6193.569
[Music]

6194.219 --> 6196.85
offense

6195.78 --> 6199.199
2015.

6196.85 --> 6201.659000000001
[Music]

6199.199 --> 6203.58
busy

6201.659 --> 6205.32
never thought yeah right so you were

6203.58 --> 6207.54
like oh there's a flatter thing out

6205.32 --> 6209.5199999999995
there it's very weird right you're like

6207.54 --> 6210.9
in the world it's all heliocentric [ __ ]

6209.52 --> 6212.6990000000005
everywhere and then it's like yeah

6210.9 --> 6214.92
there's there's a thing of Flat Earth

6212.699 --> 6216.839999999999
there it's like what

6214.92 --> 6218.58
and I still remember what that feels

6216.84 --> 6220.38
like because well majority of my life

6218.58 --> 6223.92
I've actually been in that situation

6220.38 --> 6226.4400000000005
because I had known about Flat Earth

6223.92 --> 6228.36
and then kind of forgot about it again

6226.44 --> 6231.96
but it's like every time I got

6228.36 --> 6234.599999999999
remembered it's like oh yeah oh hmm

6231.96 --> 6236.94
it's like oh yeah wait what oh Flat

6234.6 --> 6239.04
Earth what

6236.94 --> 6241.138999999999
I would forget about it but then if I

6239.04 --> 6244.199
was reminded I would remember all those

6241.139 --> 6246.0
things or most of it and then still be

6244.199 --> 6249.799999999999
like yeah well

6246.0 --> 6249.8
I'm still not entirely sure

6249.84 --> 6255.179
but I definitely understand flatter

6252.119 --> 6258.199
things right I understood flatter things

6255.179 --> 6258.1990000000005
before I actually

6258.36 --> 6264.259999999999
could really solidify in my mind as

6261.239 --> 6264.259999999999
being actually real

6267.84 --> 6269.900000000001
um

6273.84 --> 6277.8
right and then

6275.76 --> 6280.02
yeah so it was in the back of your mind

6277.8 --> 6284.76
then government literally went

6280.02 --> 6288.84
completely ape [ __ ] 1984 on us all

6284.76 --> 6292.08
and that was like okay

6288.84 --> 6294.96
thank you well to punish you government

6292.08 --> 6298.08
I'm now gonna look into Flat Earth

6294.96 --> 6301.1
because you just went too far something

6298.08 --> 6301.1
like that Richard G

6318.96 --> 6323.88
a great way to put it well I think that

6321.3 --> 6325.92
people should actually say that they

6323.88 --> 6328.7390000000005
should make statements like that

6325.92 --> 6331.7390000000005
literally just say hey government

6328.739 --> 6333.9
yeah because you messed it up so bad

6331.739 --> 6335.339999999999
with this whether you're gonna admit it

6333.9 --> 6337.5
or not right

6335.34 --> 6340.38
whether all of you are going to deny

6337.5 --> 6343.619
that it's really that or like it doesn't

6340.38 --> 6345.6
matter because this happened I am now

6343.619 --> 6348.119
looking into Flat Earth I wouldn't have

6345.6 --> 6350.280000000001
started to look into Flat Earth

6348.119 --> 6351.299999999999
and become part of it if you hadn't done

6350.28 --> 6354.179
this

6351.3 --> 6357.7390000000005
people should make those statements they

6354.179 --> 6357.7390000000005
should like make posts of that

6358.5 --> 6362.46
just say that just tell them like hey

6360.42 --> 6364.619
government yeah yeah because you did

6362.46 --> 6367.8
this we got into Flat Earth

6364.619 --> 6370.98
just so you know yeah

6367.8 --> 6373.5
I mean did did you want us to do that

6370.98 --> 6375.36
was that the intention because it's

6373.5 --> 6378.42
happened

6375.36 --> 6379.739
so you might wanna well if you don't

6378.42 --> 6382.26
want that sort of thing to happen

6379.739 --> 6385.4
anymore you might want to like

6382.26 --> 6389.54
not do it anymore

6385.4 --> 6389.54
perhaps you know

6390.659 --> 6393.659
right

6408.0 --> 6416.239
Flat Earth Dave came up first oh God

6412.739 --> 6416.239
man just skip that one

6425.46 --> 6430.86
almost like Fe isn't is the antidote for

6428.58 --> 6434.6
psyops

6430.86 --> 6434.599999999999
well actually is kind of like

6434.659 --> 6440.339999999999
hydroxychloroquine right

6437.46 --> 6443.219
it's like it's the remedy against all

6440.34 --> 6445.92
kinds of things out there

6443.219 --> 6448.619
most notably like malaria

6445.92 --> 6450.84
which isn't really it's completely it's

6448.619 --> 6453.0
like a compounded effect it's not even

6450.84 --> 6456.900000000001
like a virus

6453.0 --> 6458.82
right it's it's basically just an

6456.9 --> 6460.739
accumulation of poison giving you

6458.82 --> 6462.659
typical fever reaction which is the body

6460.739 --> 6464.159
trying to take care of the poison that

6462.659 --> 6466.44
is accumulated and if it doesn't have

6464.159 --> 6468.119
enough resources because your diet's

6466.44 --> 6470.46
kind of poor you'll have a lot of

6468.119 --> 6472.0199999999995
trouble doing that and that's what they

6470.46 --> 6473.58
call malaria

6472.02 --> 6475.7390000000005
it's like a combination of being

6473.58 --> 6479.219
malnourished and being poisoned from

6475.739 --> 6479.218999999999
mosquito acid

6479.82 --> 6485.78
the the anticoagulation agent right

6482.699 --> 6488.58
that's actually what malaria is in my

6485.78 --> 6491.4
non-doctor opinion

6488.58 --> 6494.76
and hydroxychloroquine is said it's

6491.4 --> 6495.839999999999
already used in African countries for

6494.76 --> 6498.54
that

6495.84 --> 6500.52
now whether it's a cure to malaria as a

6498.54 --> 6503.179
literal disease that's supposedly caused

6500.52 --> 6507.119000000001
by a virus or that just really helps

6503.179 --> 6509.04
taking care of these typical issues

6507.119 --> 6511.619
doesn't really matter but you could

6509.04 --> 6514.98
definitely compare fed

6511.619 --> 6516.9
do like hydroxychloroquine so just like

6514.98 --> 6519.5599999999995
it helps against all these different

6516.9 --> 6519.5599999999995
conditions

6537.54 --> 6541.4
yes mlpo totally

6541.56 --> 6547.219
but yeah I mean dude or girls

6547.32 --> 6553.92
viruses don't even exist

6550.739 --> 6555.9
like literally like it's a complete

6553.92 --> 6558.54
science fiction construct there's no

6555.9 --> 6563.5199999999995
evidence of actual viruses

6558.54 --> 6563.5199999999995
of an entity that can self-procreate

6564.239 --> 6568.32
through

6565.619 --> 6570.799999999999
living material like that doesn't even

6568.32 --> 6570.799999999999
exist

6574.679 --> 6579.06
once you realize that then you realize

6576.719 --> 6583.619
it's all just a giant Playbook I mean

6579.06 --> 6585.780000000001
the whole viruses records virology the

6583.619 --> 6588.599999999999
history you know what that really is

6585.78 --> 6592.94
that entire thing it's like a Marvel

6588.6 --> 6592.9400000000005
Universe of the medical world

6593.34 --> 6598.7390000000005
this really is what it kind of is like

6595.739 --> 6602.04
it's all freaking Fiction it's fiction

6598.739 --> 6604.379999999999
and like local data because they do do

6602.04 --> 6606.54
like analysis things

6604.38 --> 6610.1990000000005
and then after virologists drove their

6606.54 --> 6612.0
conclusions based on my correlations and

6610.199 --> 6614.219
[ __ ] right

6612.0 --> 6616.46
because there are things happening with

6614.219 --> 6616.46
people

6616.56 --> 6622.080000000001
but none of it is actually provably like

6619.32 --> 6624.42
a virus that like

6622.08 --> 6627.3
it leaks out and then another poison

6624.42 --> 6629.46
person gets infected and other Persons

6627.3 --> 6632.34
get it from them and like that's

6629.46 --> 6635.4
complete harsh [ __ ]

6632.34 --> 6637.92
doesn't even work like that at all like

6635.4 --> 6639.36
it's a condition it's not a infectious

6637.92 --> 6642.54
thing

6639.36 --> 6644.94
doesn't work like that

6642.54 --> 6646.199
like technically diseases aren't

6644.94 --> 6647.879999999999
infectious

6646.199 --> 6652.699
like that

6647.88 --> 6655.5
it's just that if the general conditions

6652.699 --> 6657.48
decrease degrade

6655.5 --> 6659.699
which could be like the environment

6657.48 --> 6662.099999999999
you're in like the rain Theory would

6659.699 --> 6664.739
definitely point at well then your body

6662.1 --> 6666.42
is going to have more burden overall and

6664.739 --> 6669.659
then there'll be a greater likelihood

6666.42 --> 6673.08
that that burden will eventually lead to

6669.659 --> 6676.0199999999995
your body tackling the situation getting

6673.08 --> 6678.0599999999995
sick to try to clean up the mess

6676.02 --> 6681.780000000001
and that sickness and how it happens

6678.06 --> 6684.06
will directly relate to the type of

6681.78 --> 6686.219
toxic influence you're having

6684.06 --> 6688.26
and then if there's a toxic environment

6686.219 --> 6690.4800000000005
of a certain type

6688.26 --> 6693.719
then everybody in that toxic environment

6690.48 --> 6696.299999999999
that's of a uniform type natoxin will

6693.719 --> 6700.02
typically get the same types of symptoms

6696.3 --> 6701.639
when they go to the overboard level

6700.02 --> 6703.1990000000005
where the body can really handle it

6701.639 --> 6705.42
anymore it's going to start fixing it

6703.199 --> 6707.82
you'll get the same symptoms because the

6705.42 --> 6709.8
conditions of the environment are the

6707.82 --> 6713.34
same influence

6709.8 --> 6716.1
so the solution in a body will result

6713.34 --> 6718.38
in a similar strategy because the toxic

6716.1 --> 6719.88
influence that's basically pushing the

6718.38 --> 6724.4400000000005
body to do that

6719.88 --> 6727.32
is the same with people see it's not an

6724.44 --> 6729.239
infection spreading now is that just

6727.32 --> 6732.84
that the toxic influence of the

6729.239 --> 6736.86
environment is the same leading to the

6732.84 --> 6738.619000000001
same types of responses in the body

6736.86 --> 6742.0199999999995
and thereby

6738.619 --> 6745.5599999999995
uniform symptoms which gives the

6742.02 --> 6747.360000000001
suggestion of a disease that might be

6745.56 --> 6749.9400000000005
spreading

6747.36 --> 6752.88
but it isn't there's no thing that's

6749.94 --> 6755.4
actually jumping from person to person

6752.88 --> 6757.8
except maybe the psychosomatic influence

6755.4 --> 6759.96
because if you're going to see a person

6757.8 --> 6763.08
that's really sick in a certain way

6759.96 --> 6765.0
you are like on the threshold of having

6763.08 --> 6767.28
the same negative influence the same

6765.0 --> 6770.159
toxic influence than your body through

6767.28 --> 6772.619
the psychosomatic signal might decide oh

6770.159 --> 6774.659
that's actually a good idea yeah we want

6772.619 --> 6777.719
to start cleaning this up too and then

6774.659 --> 6781.32
you get it not because oh no a particle

6777.719 --> 6783.2390000000005
came all the way from them oh no oh I'm

6781.32 --> 6788.0
infected no that doesn't [ __ ] happen

6783.239 --> 6790.739
no you see another person being sick

6788.0 --> 6792.3
your body your subconscious recognizes

6790.739 --> 6794.28
like hey

6792.3 --> 6797.58
we know what that is

6794.28 --> 6800.28
we should do that too very burden I want

6797.58 --> 6802.46
to clean up too and then it's through

6800.28 --> 6805.08
your subconscious that you get

6802.46 --> 6807.659
psychosomatic resonance and you get sick

6805.08 --> 6810.239
too it's not because some particle came

6807.659 --> 6812.599999999999
to you and then you were infected no

6810.239 --> 6816.0599999999995
it's because of a subconscious

6812.6 --> 6818.46
psychological resonance

6816.06 --> 6820.860000000001
your body recognized hey

6818.46 --> 6823.26
we should do that too because it's a

6820.86 --> 6825.299999999999
cleaning up process that's how you get

6823.26 --> 6828.0
it you were not infected

6825.3 --> 6830.34
You're simply synchronizing

6828.0 --> 6833.46
it's a spiritual thing not

6830.34 --> 6836.28
like a a bodily thing it's a spiritual

6833.46 --> 6840.0
thing that makes that happen

6836.28 --> 6842.46
psychological conscious related yeah

6840.0 --> 6845.34
you could like hang around people that

6842.46 --> 6846.719
are sick all day long and then listen to

6845.34 --> 6847.92
this very recovery you could actually

6846.719 --> 6849.96
test this

6847.92 --> 6852.9
so let's just say

6849.96 --> 6854.82
you have sort of a sick Ward like a

6852.9 --> 6857.28
little building where people of a

6854.82 --> 6859.32
certain type disease in the environment

6857.28 --> 6860.88
come to recover

6859.32 --> 6862.139
let's just say they're always coughing

6860.88 --> 6865.619
right

6862.139 --> 6868.679
and you're like living

6865.619 --> 6870.839999999999
right right like in the same building

6868.679 --> 6873.6
like right next to them with only a wall

6870.84 --> 6875.88
and all that blocking you you never get

6873.6 --> 6878.52
told they were there and you're sound

6875.88 --> 6880.86
proof so that you don't hear them right

6878.52 --> 6883.4400000000005
you don't hear them coughing but you're

6880.86 --> 6886.32
working and living there right there you

6883.44 --> 6889.799999999999
get the same recycled air

6886.32 --> 6892.139
through the the the the air circulation

6889.8 --> 6895.02
system in the same building right but

6892.139 --> 6897.0
you never get told or take notice that

6895.02 --> 6900.0
they are there guess what's gonna happen

6897.0 --> 6901.619
you're not gonna get sick

6900.0 --> 6904.32
hmm

6901.619 --> 6905.159
because there's nothing there to Signal

6904.32 --> 6907.259999999999
you

6905.159 --> 6909.0
to start doing that and you're probably

6907.26 --> 6912.06
doing fine

6909.0 --> 6914.34
and then one day you'll find out you're

6912.06 --> 6916.1990000000005
like walking by it's like looking

6914.34 --> 6919.139
through the glass like what the [ __ ]

6916.199 --> 6920.638999999999
it's a sick word here holy [ __ ] you see

6919.139 --> 6922.92
all these patients coughing and they're

6920.639 --> 6925.4400000000005
like oh no

6922.92 --> 6927.2390000000005
you might believe it oh I might get

6925.44 --> 6928.98
infected well guess what's gonna happen

6927.239 --> 6931.138999999999
that person's probably gonna get sick

6928.98 --> 6932.699
after spotting that now he realized what

6931.139 --> 6934.8
the hell I was around the sick people

6932.699 --> 6937.259999999999
wore it all the time and then they're

6934.8 --> 6938.9400000000005
gonna get sick because now the signal

6937.26 --> 6941.46
has arrived and they're gonna probably

6938.94 --> 6942.839999999999
get sick but before they even noticed

6941.46 --> 6944.34
that they could have lived there for

6942.84 --> 6947.400000000001
like half a year

6944.34 --> 6949.860000000001
and never got sick once because they

6947.4 --> 6951.299999999999
didn't even know it was there

6949.86 --> 6954.0
yeah

6951.3 --> 6956.4800000000005
that's real you can actually test these

6954.0 --> 6956.48
kinds of things

6956.82 --> 6961.46
knowing it really is an influence

6964.679 --> 6969.78
hmm

6967.159 --> 6972.0599999999995
who do you think of the nearly I don't

6969.78 --> 6974.42
think about it too much thanks to steamy

6972.06 --> 6974.42
Traveler

6975.08 --> 6978.32
it's weird

6980.219 --> 6985.02
like it's a bit of a mystery like to me

6982.92 --> 6988.4400000000005
what that exactly is with like herpes

6985.02 --> 6990.9800000000005
and all that because I actually kind of

6988.44 --> 6993.9
I used to have that quite a bit

6990.98 --> 6995.159
especially as a kid like on lips and

6993.9 --> 6998.4
[ __ ]

6995.159 --> 7002.659
I haven't had it in ages now

6998.4 --> 7005.0599999999995
I used to have it decently regular

7002.659 --> 7007.46
and now it's kind of gone

7005.06 --> 7008.7390000000005
and like it's like never coming back I

7007.46 --> 7012.26
could be like

7008.739 --> 7015.5
coffee sniffy it's not there it's not

7012.26 --> 7018.619000000001
coming it's not happening

7015.5 --> 7021.08
it's almost like it's cured

7018.619 --> 7024.139
so I don't know exactly what that is

7021.08 --> 7026.42
it's a bit of a mystery to me yeah they

7024.139 --> 7028.58
say it's like a virus that just comes

7026.42 --> 7030.08
righty that like hides in your nerve

7028.58 --> 7032.0
system and then when your nerve system

7030.08 --> 7034.639
blooms up that's when it comes out

7032.0 --> 7036.8
starts doing this stuff that's how they

7034.639 --> 7039.6990000000005
explain it I don't actually understand

7036.8 --> 7039.6990000000005
what it is

7040.639 --> 7047.4800000000005
I just know when you have that thing

7044.56 --> 7049.719
don't have sex

7047.48 --> 7053.0599999999995
don't do it

7049.719 --> 7055.76
don't do it

7053.06 --> 7057.38
I don't know exactly what's happening

7055.76 --> 7059.84
with it I just know like how

7057.38 --> 7063.139
psychosomatics and all that work and I

7059.84 --> 7065.360000000001
know just be very careful don't have sex

7063.139 --> 7067.400000000001
when you have a condition like that it

7065.36 --> 7069.5
can go wrong

7067.4 --> 7073.04
with me it actually did go wrong one

7069.5 --> 7074.599
time which I still really regret I

7073.04 --> 7078.159
really hope she doesn't have any

7074.599 --> 7078.159000000001
continuous problems with that

7078.98 --> 7084.919999999999
really do because I feel quite guilty

7081.199 --> 7087.58
over that that's decades ago now

7084.92 --> 7090.38
but uh

7087.58 --> 7092.42
[Music]

7090.38 --> 7094.58
I'm just really glad that it doesn't

7092.42 --> 7097.34
really happen anymore

7094.58 --> 7098.659
and then again maybe it is also just a

7097.34 --> 7102.52
direct effect

7098.659 --> 7102.5199999999995
that comes with like sex addiction

7102.619 --> 7105.92
people that are always chasing like that

7104.9 --> 7109.96
right

7105.92 --> 7109.96
well I'm not chasing anymore

7110.119 --> 7116.5
where

7112.34 --> 7116.5
and maybe that's kind of made it stop

7116.659 --> 7122.0
I'm not sure if that is what is

7119.599 --> 7124.159000000001
happening has made it stop

7122.0 --> 7127.04
I just know there's a correlation I

7124.159 --> 7129.44
haven't like gone after women since my

7127.04 --> 7133.28
ex which is like eight years ago now

7129.44 --> 7134.719
or well nine years ago

7133.28 --> 7137.36
and

7134.719 --> 7139.639
like I'm not have like I'm not getting

7137.36 --> 7142.0599999999995
it anymore it's it stopped it just

7139.639 --> 7142.06
stopped

7142.219 --> 7147.619
like even in Weak conditions or in sick

7144.8 --> 7150.92
condition or even in super angry

7147.619 --> 7153.139
I used to typically like get it right

7150.92 --> 7155.599
after I would go completely [ __ ]

7153.139 --> 7157.6990000000005
angry like really angry and I would like

7155.599 --> 7161.06
hurt my voice because I was so angry

7157.699 --> 7162.919999999999
after that I I would sometimes like get

7161.06 --> 7165.02
a lip issue

7162.92 --> 7167.36
was always associated with very strong

7165.02 --> 7171.46
emotions and that would like trigger it

7167.36 --> 7171.46
afterward it's not happening anymore

7172.46 --> 7175.179
it isn't

7177.26 --> 7182.7390000000005
maybe it's also because I have my

7179.179 --> 7182.7390000000005
emotions just better under control

7184.4 --> 7188.98
in the eyes Jesus no food that's

7189.56 --> 7194.939
that's messed up

7191.83 --> 7194.939
[Music]

7203.679 --> 7209.4800000000005
vaccine isn't a cure it's prevention

7206.119 --> 7213.339999999999
that's ridiculous

7209.48 --> 7213.339999999999
that's ridiculous already knuckle

7214.219 --> 7218.139
you can't prevent these things

7222.8 --> 7227.0
there's only a few things you can

7224.9 --> 7230.5
actually prevent with vaccines and

7227.0 --> 7230.5
that's like childhood diseases

7245.06 --> 7249.92
you don't want to get me into trouble

7247.46 --> 7252.9800000000005
I'm not gonna get into trouble you just

7249.92 --> 7255.159
have to not be wrong in my chat or in

7317.48 --> 7321.098999999999
[ __ ] [ __ ] or an uncle Wombo

7330.619 --> 7336.92
yeah I'm not even gonna

7332.96 --> 7339.5
tell you how it is at this point

7336.92 --> 7342.679
you should know better than that

7339.5 --> 7344.719
you're literally contradicting official

7342.679 --> 7347.4800000000005
statistics at this point

7344.719 --> 7349.9
with those statements

7347.48 --> 7349.9

just stop being wrong

7390.98 --> 7395.419999999999
yeah it's not about [ __ ] opinions

7393.199 --> 7398.36
this is about you being wrong

7395.42 --> 7401.0
and me and the rest here being right

7398.36 --> 7404.38
that's what this is about

7401.0 --> 7404.38
stop being wrong

7408.39 --> 7413.719
[Music]

7410.78 --> 7415.179
FD today no it doesn't seem like it's

7413.719 --> 7417.8
steamy Traveler

7415.179 --> 7420.02
I mean Nathan said that he was gonna do

7417.8 --> 7423.08
like a members only stream later on but

7420.02 --> 7426.1990000000005
not an actual live stream he's got like

7423.08 --> 7429.82
some ear issues

7426.199 --> 7433.28
Jesus Christ a bunch of

7429.82 --> 7437.659
man are they feeling the Skype here

7433.28 --> 7440.32
there's literally like six pages of text

7437.659 --> 7440.32
huh

7446.56 --> 7450.619000000001
what are you gonna do so yeah we were on

7448.94 --> 7454.219
the subject

7450.619 --> 7457.28
just stop being [ __ ] wrong all right

7454.219 --> 7459.88
yeah and I'll worry about my presence

7457.28 --> 7459.88
here on YouTube

7485.38 --> 7490.96
right but yeah I've been going for over

7487.82 --> 7490.96
two hours already

7496.4 --> 7501.32
oh Emma Peel that's not entirely correct

7498.86 --> 7504.5199999999995
I can actually be held responsible for

7501.32 --> 7504.5199999999995
what people say in the chat

7508.179 --> 7516.08
but I mean the the Giant

7512.9 --> 7520.159
ban on saying anything medical related

7516.08 --> 7522.0199999999995
in relation to covet has been lifted

7520.159 --> 7524.839999999999
a while ago

7522.02 --> 7528.56
yes it was on there for a very long time

7524.84 --> 7532.219
and if you said anything like in 2022

7528.56 --> 7534.92
about it they will literally strike you

7532.219 --> 7537.82
it's not like that anymore you can't

7534.92 --> 7537.82
talk about it now

7537.86 --> 7543.739
you just gotta have you have to be very

7540.02 --> 7547.040000000001
careful to go into Super details

7543.739 --> 7549.678999999999
or making like claims as a doctor you

7547.04 --> 7551.78
have to still be careful but you can

7549.679 --> 7554.3
just generally talk about it now that's

7551.78 --> 7557.179
why I just say coving now I can't say

7554.3 --> 7560.119000000001
covet I've said it quite a few times in

7557.179 --> 7561.9800000000005
the last week actually on the show it's

7560.119 --> 7565.28
okay now

7561.98 --> 7568.54
they just they just turn that off

7565.28 --> 7568.54
a while ago

7568.58 --> 7572.44
I was kind of surprised about it too

7573.38 --> 7578.78
but they like turned it off like half a

7575.36 --> 7581.5
year ago somewhere this summer

7578.78 --> 7581.5
or spring

7586.159 --> 7590.119
so

7588.26 --> 7592.159000000001
that still doesn't mean that it's now

7590.119 --> 7594.139
all green lighted to just act like a

7592.159 --> 7597.379999999999
bunch of asses with it

7594.139 --> 7600.32
but we can just talk about it without

7597.38 --> 7602.179
this constant looming threat of getting

7600.32 --> 7605.179
banned just because we use those words

7602.179 --> 7607.159
that's the difference

7605.179 --> 7611.119
I mean if you're gonna make like weird

7607.159 --> 7614.0599999999995
completely unsubstantial claims

7611.119 --> 7616.94
that are like related to the medical

7614.06 --> 7620.02
situation in the moment you could still

7616.94 --> 7620.0199999999995
get in trouble for that

7621.199 --> 7627.5
but I mean if I just go pointing at

7623.659 --> 7630.32
facts like oh hey what where's the [ __ ]

7627.5 --> 7634.48
postulate why did you apply it

7630.32 --> 7637.58
where's this virus this is repeatable

7634.48 --> 7640.699
self-replicating little thing where's

7637.58 --> 7642.679
that oh you don't have it oh yeah I can

7640.699 --> 7645.5
point to that all day long because

7642.679 --> 7648.5
that's literally true

7645.5 --> 7650.96
it is not there it is there is no proof

7648.5 --> 7653.599
there is no cost special it applied they

7650.96 --> 7656.3
have no proof of viruses at all entirely

7653.599 --> 7659.119000000001
it's basically just a model

7656.3 --> 7661.219
it's just a model they use

7659.119 --> 7663.619
and that's it

7661.219 --> 7666.26
so I can just say that I could even say

7663.619 --> 7668.42
that two years ago that's why I did say

7666.26 --> 7671.659000000001
that that's why I had entire shows with

7668.42 --> 7673.159
saying viruses don't really exist in the

7671.659 --> 7675.619
title

7673.159 --> 7679.839999999999
and those shows are still up

7675.619 --> 7679.839999999999
from two years ago and more

7679.88 --> 7687.5
because it's true

7683.78 --> 7691.639
and I didn't talk about all this oh no

7687.5 --> 7694.159
it came from a certain laboratory in a

7691.639 --> 7696.139
certain country oh yeah that show did

7694.159 --> 7697.699
get taken now even when I try to make a

7696.139 --> 7700.639
joke about it

7697.699 --> 7701.54
right when they said like oh it's made

7700.639 --> 7704.2390000000005
up

7701.54 --> 7706.82
in a laboratory

7704.239 --> 7708.379999999999
in a certain country right I put that in

7706.82 --> 7710.659
a title thought it was really smart well

7708.38 --> 7712.28
that one got taken down I got a strike

7710.659 --> 7714.08
for that back then

7712.28 --> 7720.28
because why

7714.08 --> 7724.159
because I was addressing the narrative

7720.28 --> 7726.5
the alternative narrative yeah

7724.159 --> 7730.4
I was using

7726.5 --> 7731.78
the system of the Brotherhood of

7730.4 --> 7735.5
grifters

7731.78 --> 7737.659
which is in direct opposition to the

7735.5 --> 7740.36
liberal Imperium narrative

7737.659 --> 7742.46
yeah that it was from bats

7740.36 --> 7746.119
and stuff

7742.46 --> 7748.28
yeah so when I start addressing that tug

7746.119 --> 7750.5
between the Brotherhood of grifters and

7748.28 --> 7753.199
the liberal Imperium their vernacular

7750.5 --> 7755.26
when I started to like get involved like

7753.199 --> 7758.44
oh I have something to say about that

7755.26 --> 7761.96
that's when they get you because now

7758.44 --> 7764.0
you're playing you're like getting in

7761.96 --> 7766.159
the shooting war between those groups

7764.0 --> 7768.139
and when you try to do that when you try

7766.159 --> 7771.379999999999
to get in the middle of it that's when

7768.139 --> 7772.58
you really get the big strikes

7771.38 --> 7775.400000000001
right

7772.58 --> 7777.38
but when I just say like hey uh viruses

7775.4 --> 7778.94
don't exist there's no proof that they

7777.38 --> 7780.679
actually exist

7778.94 --> 7782.48
yeah

7780.679 --> 7786.32
it's science fiction cost questions

7782.48 --> 7788.598999999999
never applied they don't do anything

7786.32 --> 7791.84
they don't do anything about it

7788.599 --> 7794.02
because it's not part

7791.84 --> 7796.719
of the current

7794.02 --> 7800.84
vernacular of the current

7796.719 --> 7802.04
uh narrative between the Brotherhood of

7800.84 --> 7804.8
grifters

7802.04 --> 7807.8
and the liberal Imperium because when

7804.8 --> 7811.04
you talk about that thing that's when

7807.8 --> 7812.4800000000005
you're gonna get the full blows of the

7811.04 --> 7813.8
system that's when you're gonna get to

7812.48 --> 7815.718999999999
strike that's when they kick you off

7813.8 --> 7817.219
that's when they give you fines that's

7815.719 --> 7820.099
when they fire you

7817.219 --> 7822.82
when you get involved in that specific

7820.099 --> 7822.82
narrative

7825.5 --> 7828.88
that's what I figured out

7830.36 --> 7836.96
right it's all about the current thing

7832.52 --> 7839.599
if you get involved in the current thing

7836.96 --> 7842.2390000000005
that's when they get you

7839.599 --> 7843.219
but only if you get involved in the

7842.239 --> 7848.299999999999
current thing

7843.219 --> 7849.7390000000005
using the specific narrative that they

7848.3 --> 7852.08
use

7849.739 --> 7856.28
because if you're gonna talk about the

7852.08 --> 7859.28
subject but not using their words their

7856.28 --> 7861.679
focus but instead oh let's take a look

7859.28 --> 7863.84
around on the other side like what I

7861.679 --> 7866.54
just described right viruses don't exist

7863.84 --> 7868.159000000001
cost botulates never applied well they

7866.54 --> 7871.46
don't bring that up it's not part of

7868.159 --> 7874.339999999999
their vernacular they don't want you to

7871.46 --> 7878.0
actually know about that so when you

7874.34 --> 7880.099
talk about that and it's not part of

7878.0 --> 7884.719
what they talk about in the current

7880.099 --> 7888.219
thing then you don't get into trouble

7884.719 --> 7890.54
because you didn't Graft in

7888.219 --> 7891.86
their narrative

7890.54 --> 7894.0199999999995
yeah

7891.86 --> 7896.839999999999
when the Wizards are doing wizard

7894.02 --> 7898.88
battles right at the top of the pyramid

7896.84 --> 7901.88
yeah Brotherhood of grifters versus

7898.88 --> 7905.78
liberal Imperium they don't want you to

7901.88 --> 7909.02
start using their vernacular their

7905.78 --> 7911.42
narratives that's when they get you like

7909.02 --> 7913.46
don't get in between a wizard battle

7911.42 --> 7916.6990000000005
that's their thing

7913.46 --> 7920.5
but you can talk about it around it if

7916.699 --> 7920.5
you don't use their spells

7920.659 --> 7923.259999999999
do you understand

7925.58 --> 7930.5599999999995
yeah exactly I'm appeal

7928.04 --> 7933.44
it's like you have freedom of speech

7930.56 --> 7936.04
unless what you are saying is messing up

7933.44 --> 7936.04
our plans

7936.86 --> 7943.598999999999
it's what's not even messing up our

7938.599 --> 7943.599
plants if you just can't use our words

7945.199 --> 7948.86
I mean everything is messing up their

7946.88 --> 7951.02
plans if me pointing out that hey

7948.86 --> 7952.759999999999
viruses don't actually exist yeah that's

7951.02 --> 7953.84
definitely messing up their plans isn't

7952.76 --> 7958.06
it

7953.84 --> 7958.06
but it's so outside of it

7958.34 --> 7964.159000000001
that they can ignore that

7962.0 --> 7966.199
people can bump into me and just say

7964.159 --> 7968.119
he's just playing with it this is

7966.199 --> 7969.739
completely made up there's no way that's

7968.119 --> 7972.5
real virus have to be real it's

7969.739 --> 7974.0599999999995
ridiculous yeah that's what they're

7972.5 --> 7977.3
counting on

7974.06 --> 7978.860000000001
but if you're literally using their

7977.3 --> 7981.5
words

7978.86 --> 7984.86
in their wizard battle then it's like

7981.5 --> 7986.599
how dare you try to get involved this is

7984.86 --> 7990.28
our wizard battle you can't use our

7986.599 --> 7990.28
words that's when you get the strikes

7991.159 --> 7995.54
so it's not even about messing with the

7993.079 --> 7997.88
plants it's about using their words like

7995.54 --> 8000.639
don't use our spells

7997.88 --> 8003.579
this is our spell we are casting these

8000.639 --> 8006.34
spells we're we're this is our [ __ ]

8003.579 --> 8009.28
don't you dare use our [ __ ]

8006.34 --> 8011.8
that's kind of what it's like

8009.28 --> 8013.84
like oh if you're gonna use our spells

8011.8 --> 8015.88
well then that means you're one of us

8013.84 --> 8017.7390000000005
and if you're one of us then that means

8015.88 --> 8019.3
you are going to be targeted by the

8017.739 --> 8022.32
opponents

8019.3 --> 8022.320000000001
by the other side

8024.639 --> 8029.1990000000005
right if you're suddenly like a guy

8027.28 --> 8032.259999999999
you're like hey I want some

8029.199 --> 8033.638999999999
advertisement okay I'm gonna promote the

8032.26 --> 8035.8
vaccine

8033.639 --> 8038.079
is really [ __ ] disgusting but hey if

8035.8 --> 8040.06
somebody could do that and guess what

8038.079 --> 8042.579
yeah that makes them kind of an agent of

8040.06 --> 8044.5
the liberal Imperium whatever Imperium

8042.579 --> 8045.699
is going to be like oh yeah sure why not

8044.5 --> 8047.32
cool

8045.699 --> 8049.178999999999
they don't care

8047.32 --> 8051.639
but then the brother of grifter was like

8049.179 --> 8055.42
oh it's another evil what's her another

8051.639 --> 8057.46
one has startup not a corrupted devil

8055.42 --> 8059.7390000000005
and they're gonna like poke you they're

8057.46 --> 8063.3
gonna come after you now

8059.739 --> 8068.44
right that's because you started using

8063.3 --> 8070.0
their wizard lingo their narrative you

8068.44 --> 8072.638999999999
became part of it for whatever reason

8070.0 --> 8074.26
now you get targeted by the opponents

8072.639 --> 8076.54
if you want to do the same thing with

8074.26 --> 8078.46
the brother of the grifters and you're

8076.54 --> 8081.699
like oh I'm gonna

8078.46 --> 8083.9800000000005
I'm gonna talk about how it was made in

8081.699 --> 8085.96
a certain laboratory in a country I'm

8083.98 --> 8087.459999999999
gonna spread that and and well then the

8085.96 --> 8088.719
brother of Grist is gonna be like oh wow

8087.46 --> 8091.0
there's another one there's another

8088.719 --> 8095.099
brother standing up guess what liberal

8091.0 --> 8100.179
Imperium oh no he is with them

8095.099 --> 8102.400000000001
quickly Google all our tentacles quickly

8100.179 --> 8104.139
strangle him yeah so you're gonna get

8102.4 --> 8106.239
attacked because you suddenly started

8104.139 --> 8107.5
using the vernacular of the Brotherhood

8106.239 --> 8111.178999999999
of grifters

8107.5 --> 8111.179
you started to get involved

8111.699 --> 8116.919999999999
you started to use their specific

8113.8 --> 8119.4400000000005
narrative now they start strangling you

8116.92 --> 8121.0
if you only just said like hey viruses

8119.44 --> 8122.619
aren't real because postulates never

8121.0 --> 8125.139
applied

8122.619 --> 8127.179
the big machine doesn't even take notice

8125.139 --> 8128.92
of that like they're not like that's not

8127.179 --> 8131.26
the lingo of the Brotherhood of drifters

8128.92 --> 8132.82
it's not part of it rather grifter

8131.26 --> 8136.2390000000005
Brotherhood of grifters is still

8132.82 --> 8138.28
upholding the idea that viruses are real

8136.239 --> 8140.739
they're not dispelling that

8138.28 --> 8142.42
they're absolutely not dispelling it so

8140.739 --> 8146.879999999999
that means you're not part of the world

8142.42 --> 8146.88
of rifters and so you're not a Target

8147.36 --> 8151.0199999999995
see how this works

8152.739 --> 8157.54
I really hope it does because I just

8155.92 --> 8158.9800000000005
spend a whole bunch of time trying to

8157.54 --> 8163.199
explain this

8158.98 --> 8163.199
to the finest detail that I can think of

8174.699 --> 8177.299999999999
foreign

8182.139 --> 8185.219
hey what's this

8192.16 --> 8196.38
has everyone gone I don't know what's

8194.139 --> 8196.38
happened

8197.559 --> 8200.399
Emma Peel

8201.519 --> 8206.2
maybe they're just all in trance of my

8204.28 --> 8208.059000000001
explanation

8206.2 --> 8210.519
this happens sometimes it even happens

8208.059 --> 8212.679
when I listen my to my own show by the

8210.519 --> 8215.2
way so I'm starting to get you guys so

8212.679 --> 8217.24
more so much more

8215.2 --> 8219.820000000002
I'm literally like

8217.24 --> 8222.58
sometimes I watch my own video

8219.82 --> 8224.92
and then I'm listening so carefully and

8222.58 --> 8227.559
I'm like going like wow I totally get it

8224.92 --> 8229.899
and then I literally hear myself hello

8227.559 --> 8231.699999999999
hello could somebody just say something

8229.899 --> 8235.358999999999
and yet I'm like oh

8231.7 --> 8237.76
like I go into hypnosis from me talking

8235.359 --> 8243.42
on YouTube so I totally get you guys

8237.76 --> 8243.42
with that it does kind of happen sorry

8245.019 --> 8249.939
it's really funny when I have to snap

8247.359 --> 8252.28
myself out of the trance from listening

8249.939 --> 8255.0
to me

8252.28 --> 8255.0
uh

8256.96 --> 8260.678999999998
oh you're about to leave to go to work

8258.82 --> 8262.66
okay I could move hours well thanks for

8260.679 --> 8265.62
being here see you later hope you all

8262.66 --> 8265.619999999999
enjoyed the show

8275.38 --> 8278.639
do the brother of Griff just keep close

8277.059 --> 8283.059
tab on Effie to prevent it from

8278.639 --> 8285.539999999999
spreading too much yes absolutely

8283.059 --> 8288.639
because the Brotherhood of grifters is

8285.54 --> 8291.7
hyper heliocentric

8288.639 --> 8294.219
they are champions of the globe

8291.7 --> 8296.679
they're all about cool moon landing

8294.219 --> 8299.139
National they're all about moon landing

8296.679 --> 8301.12
nationalism I think that's really a

8299.139 --> 8303.16
proper word for it it's like moon

8301.12 --> 8306.34
landing nationalism

8303.16 --> 8308.019
is something that really defines the

8306.34 --> 8311.92
Brotherhood of grifters

8308.019 --> 8314.380000000001
so they're very anti-flat Earth overall

8311.92 --> 8317.26
although some of them are like oh I'm so

8314.38 --> 8319.779999999999
free speech I will even have a talk with

8317.26 --> 8321.16
a flat earther

8319.78 --> 8324.7
and they do

8321.16 --> 8327.039999999999
but they never actually accept it they

8324.7 --> 8329.62
never stop talking about going to the

8327.04 --> 8331.84
stars and the stupid moon landing and oh

8329.62 --> 8334.62
we're we could do better than this we

8331.84 --> 8337.24
could go to the to outer space

8334.62 --> 8340.899000000001
they always keep pulling that [ __ ] back

8337.24 --> 8343.179
in because it's part of their system

8340.899 --> 8345.46
of their dream from the Brotherhood or

8343.179 --> 8348.88
grifters

8345.46 --> 8351.82
so they always try to like

8348.88 --> 8354.119999999999
cut out flat earthers so they don't have

8351.82 --> 8354.119999999999
room

8354.219 --> 8356.82
yes

8358.479 --> 8362.8
yeah and the funny thing is by the way

8360.7 --> 8365.880000000001
that the liberal Imperium

8362.8 --> 8365.88
doesn't care

8366.519 --> 8371.2
literally the liberal appearance doesn't

8368.859 --> 8373.599
care about the moon landing or the globe

8371.2 --> 8376.0
they don't care they're completely

8373.599 --> 8378.82
neutral on average

8376.0 --> 8381.519
like Libra Imperium has a fluid

8378.82 --> 8383.74
perspective on reality they only see

8381.519 --> 8386.139000000001
opinions really they don't really care

8383.74 --> 8387.58
what it really is what the truth is they

8386.139 --> 8388.72
only see that there's differences of

8387.58 --> 8390.46
opinion that's how the liberal

8388.72 --> 8392.32
appearance looks at things and the

8390.46 --> 8395.259999999998
people in it

8392.32 --> 8398.38
they don't care whether the Earth is

8395.26 --> 8401.2
flat or a globe really they don't care

8398.38 --> 8403.539999999999
brother of grifter's cares

8401.2 --> 8406.84
it's part of their story it's part of

8403.54 --> 8409.0
their story background The Pride that's

8406.84 --> 8410.62
holding everything up

8409.0 --> 8412.3
neighborhood Imperium doesn't give a

8410.62 --> 8414.34
[ __ ]

8412.3 --> 8416.8
they don't mind either way they'll

8414.34 --> 8418.54
they'll gladly invite Flat Earth there's

8416.8 --> 8420.699999999999
just a [ __ ] with the Brotherhood of

8418.54 --> 8422.800000000001
grifter's narrative just to do that

8420.7 --> 8424.18
because flat earthers will point out how

8422.8 --> 8426.46
it's all [ __ ]

8424.18 --> 8428.14
and they will be able to back it up and

8426.46 --> 8430.66
be convincing so the brother of Griffith

8428.14 --> 8432.699999999999
is like yeah flat earthers I mean uh

8430.66 --> 8435.96
they were Imperium it's like yeah flat

8432.7 --> 8435.960000000001
earthers why not

8436.06 --> 8442.26
like as long as that people don't

8438.22 --> 8442.26
complain too much about it is fine

8443.38 --> 8447.16
right

8445.18 --> 8448.479000000001
as long as they're not too disruptive

8447.16 --> 8450.88
but they're

8448.479 --> 8452.8
liberal Imperium kind of likes it flat

8450.88 --> 8454.358999999999
earthers because they get in the way of

8452.8 --> 8456.779999999999
the Brotherhood of grifter's narrative

8454.359 --> 8456.78
typically

8458.02 --> 8461.5
product of grifters would be a great

8459.939 --> 8464.28
name for a band

8461.5 --> 8464.28
no

8470.68 --> 8475.859
maybe the grifters would be a good man

8473.5 --> 8475.859
name

8476.62 --> 8480.240000000002
like a punk band or something

8480.34 --> 8484.42
I don't know

8481.899 --> 8488.38
but uh

8484.42 --> 8490.84
yeah again brother of grifters they're

8488.38 --> 8492.58
really heliocentric typically they use

8490.84 --> 8494.92
it in their story that's their dream

8492.58 --> 8499.14
they're trying to resurrect

8494.92 --> 8499.14
this moon landing nationalism

8499.479 --> 8503.92
and the

8500.979 --> 8505.899
liberal Imperium does not

8503.92 --> 8507.64
they think they can just create reality

8505.899 --> 8509.439
they can just decide upon what the

8507.64 --> 8511.358999999999
reality will be

8509.439 --> 8513.16
because they don't believe in reality

8511.359 --> 8514.899000000001
they only believe there's in there's

8513.16 --> 8517.06
opinions

8514.899 --> 8520.72
and so they don't care what the reality

8517.06 --> 8522.58
is among the opinions really

8520.72 --> 8526.479
but they're fine with flat earthers and

8522.58 --> 8528.7
they're very they'll gladly use them as

8526.479 --> 8530.019999999999
in give them a bit of room so they can

8528.7 --> 8532.12
do their thing

8530.02 --> 8535.560000000001
encounter The Narrative of the

8532.12 --> 8535.560000000001
Brotherhood of grifters naturally

8535.78 --> 8541.78
it's not because they love them the flat

8538.42 --> 8544.12
earthers it's just that it's convenient

8541.78 --> 8546.28
for them

8544.12 --> 8548.439
it's like oh well we tolerate Flat Earth

8546.28 --> 8550.84
is because we're so liberal we have a

8548.439 --> 8554.08
real freedom of speech

8550.84 --> 8555.460000000001
but they don't really care about him but

8554.08 --> 8557.74
they'll give them that room right

8555.46 --> 8559.839999999998
because say it's a good very natural

8557.74 --> 8561.64
Grassroots counterbalance for that's

8559.84 --> 8563.319
very convenient for them that'll counter

8561.64 --> 8565.84
the Brotherhood of grifter's narrative

8563.319 --> 8568.0
typically like the Baseline of that

8565.84 --> 8569.56
narrative

8568.0 --> 8572.439
and the brother of grifters in the

8569.56 --> 8575.08
meantime is well struggling with that

8572.439 --> 8577.18
edge that the liver Imperium has over

8575.08 --> 8579.52
them through Flat Earth

8577.18 --> 8582.34
so for the brother of grifters it's

8579.52 --> 8585.640000000001
really like how do we get closer to the

8582.34 --> 8587.68
flat earthers without breaking the spell

8585.64 --> 8589.68
of the dream

8587.68 --> 8591.64
so they are working on average on

8589.68 --> 8594.939
compartmentalizing it's like we have to

8591.64 --> 8596.8
dream of going to the stars in the Moon

8594.939 --> 8598.720000000001
but at the same time yeah but also Flat

8596.8 --> 8600.399
Earth is also cool yeah you guys are

8598.72 --> 8602.56
fine like

8600.399 --> 8605.319
freedom speech you are we we could have

8602.56 --> 8607.06
a discussion about that right you know

8605.319 --> 8608.68
you can because as soon as you do you

8607.06 --> 8612.039999999999
realize you're [ __ ] because the Earth

8608.68 --> 8614.92
really is flat you know all this globe

8612.04 --> 8617.319000000001
nonsense really not holding up

8614.92 --> 8620.26
but they're trying they're trying to at

8617.319 --> 8623.019999999999
least be tolerant and but it was always

8620.26 --> 8625.06
more liberal oriented and I think that

8623.02 --> 8627.640000000001
it was the liberal Imperium that really

8625.06 --> 8630.16
initiated the opening of Flat Earth on

8627.64 --> 8632.199999999999
YouTube and such I think it was actually

8630.16 --> 8634.8
the liberal Imperium that made it as a

8632.2 --> 8634.800000000001
tactical move

8636.64 --> 8642.16
which is really weird right

8639.819 --> 8645.76
to realize that Flat Earth

8642.16 --> 8649.24
got the open doors suddenly

8645.76 --> 8652.979
because of the Liberals

8649.24 --> 8652.979
that's pretty freaky right

8661.38 --> 8665.938999999998
there's already a band called The

8663.34 --> 8665.939
Griffith oh

8669.16 --> 8673.319
okay I didn't know that that's funny

8673.68 --> 8678.880000000001
right anyhow

8676.84 --> 8680.92
I think I'm gonna move towards rounding

8678.88 --> 8683.199999999999
out the show I've been going over

8680.92 --> 8685.6
two hours 22 minutes

8683.2 --> 8688.08
hey mystical rockhound fossils good to

8685.6 --> 8688.08
see you by the way

8689.319 --> 8693.939
and seeking star Waters

8691.96 --> 8695.08
star water I didn't notice you there

8693.939 --> 8699.18
sorry

8695.08 --> 8699.18
yeah you said the flatter Society thing

8702.28 --> 8706.74
but you guys do get my point right

8707.14 --> 8713.38
three more hours there's a bit much

8710.38 --> 8714.938999999998
there steamy traveler now I

8713.38 --> 8718.08
I'm gonna go out there get some

8714.939 --> 8718.08
groceries after this

8730.54 --> 8735.34
but do you guys see my case

8733.06 --> 8736.24
how it's actually the liberal Imperium

8735.34 --> 8738.22
that

8736.24 --> 8739.479
that opened the floodgates for Flat

8738.22 --> 8741.88
Earth

8739.479 --> 8744.76
because to them they don't care it's all

8741.88 --> 8746.56
neutral but they knew that we were gonna

8744.76 --> 8749.08
basically get in the way of the

8746.56 --> 8752.46
Brotherhood of grifters which are there

8749.08 --> 8752.46
natural enemy

8756.76 --> 8761.92
wow I'm appeal that's

8758.92 --> 8761.92
that's ridiculous

8779.859 --> 8783.720000000001
all right anyhow

8792.819 --> 8798.34
right so for some reason the guys are

8795.16 --> 8800.08
having a big Skype call on Master B here

8798.34 --> 8802.68
I might join them later but I'm

8800.08 --> 8805.899
definitely rounding out the show now

8802.68 --> 8808.6
