so yeah especially to get me through the

79.119 --> 84.0
next two weeks

80.64 --> 87.6
and three weeks

84.0 --> 91.68
i don't know something like that uh

87.6 --> 93.6
right so the weather today is

91.68 --> 96.799
quite a change all of a sudden it's

93.6 --> 100.64
actually really warm

96.799 --> 103.04
and i guess part big part of it is

100.64 --> 104.56
look how clear that blue sky is in

103.04 --> 106.56
between there

104.56 --> 108.72
and yeah there's still some clouds but

106.56 --> 112.07900000000001
it's not completely covered everywhere

108.72 --> 115.52
a kind of pieteresque cloud

112.079 --> 119.6
situation going on and most importantly

115.52 --> 122.479
it's almost completely wind still

119.6 --> 123.83999999999999
so yeah that all combines into pretty

122.479 --> 126.88
nice

123.84 --> 126.88000000000001
after summer day

127.36 --> 133.28
and yes kind of like that

130.879 --> 134.72
because my newspaper rounds

133.28 --> 136.64000000000001
[Music]

134.72 --> 138.48
you know last week it was so bad the

136.64 --> 138.879
weather was so terrible that i skipped

138.48 --> 142.0
it so

138.879 --> 145.599
kind of nice to see that yeah

142.0 --> 149.2
just gonna have to have have a

145.599 --> 152.16
nice and sunny paper route

149.2 --> 154.07999999999998
after the death shows so anyway let's

152.16 --> 157.68
see who is in chat so far

154.08 --> 160.16000000000003
ah check oh was first

157.68 --> 160.72
gotta switch bella hello long time no

160.16 --> 164.0
see

160.72 --> 167.76
yeah i saw you in spruce chemo so uh

164.0 --> 167.76
omar moko michael jones

167.92 --> 174.95899999999997
yeah good to see you all

171.519 --> 177.519
you skipped delivering paper yes i did

174.959 --> 181.28
because i felt kind of sick and the

177.519 --> 184.56
weather was absolutely horrific

181.28 --> 186.8
so yeah i didn't and despite that the

184.56 --> 187.2
next day i was still slightly sick but

186.8 --> 190.08
hey

187.2 --> 192.0
at least i recovered quickly my

190.08 --> 194.08
prognosis for myself is that i

192.0 --> 195.76
if i had done it yet last week i

194.08 --> 198.15900000000002
probably would have been

195.76 --> 199.44
like had a serious flu now all week or

198.159 --> 204.959
something like that

199.44 --> 204.959
and i didn't so yeah that's what it is

208.08 --> 211.12
hey nathan oakley

211.76 --> 218.239
watching ad yay always do that

215.84 --> 218.239
um

219.36 --> 222.72000000000003
no news is good news

225.36 --> 232.31900000000002
oh i've had in florida is rain

228.48 --> 232.319
hmm was that all summer

233.599 --> 238.83999999999997
we got a switchbella

236.72 --> 241.68
we had a really good hot summer over

238.84 --> 244.08
here

241.68 --> 244.959
it was so hot that yeah i've been like

244.08 --> 247.12
two weeks

244.959 --> 250.48
at least without shirt done the show

247.12 --> 250.48000000000002
without a shirt it was too hot

251.599 --> 256.239
out of it what

256.479 --> 259.519
most of it okay

260.0 --> 262.479
too bad

265.05 --> 269.84000000000003
[Music]

266.479 --> 269.84
right anyway uh

271.68 --> 284.56
let's see was it doing yesterday

282.08 --> 284.56
oh yeah

285.44 --> 289.52
yeah no omen benjamin yesterday after

287.36 --> 290.88
the flat earth debates

289.52 --> 292.96
that or maybe it was there and it

290.88 --> 296.4
completely missed out

292.96 --> 300.08
but uh i don't know

296.4 --> 300.08
what i've been doing yesterday

308.0 --> 312.88
watch back my own show was pretty was

310.4 --> 312.88
pretty good

313.039 --> 320.56
uh oh yeah weird situation by the way

317.919 --> 322.4
again like in my show yesterday and was

320.56 --> 325.44
a really good show i thought

322.4 --> 327.84
it's set to zero up votes now

325.44 --> 328.639
just like that and every like yeah

327.84 --> 330.79999999999995
everybody

328.639 --> 332.40000000000003
probably remembers that it's not how it

330.8 --> 335.44
ended so yeah

332.4 --> 335.44
it got rigged again

336.0 --> 342.96
it's weird especially because it doesn't

339.12 --> 342.96
seem to happen every single show

343.28 --> 350.71999999999997
but periodically like every two

346.639 --> 354.96000000000004
every show or every every two shows

350.72 --> 354.96000000000004
they do that it's weird

357.84 --> 367.84
do you know your record down votes no

360.96 --> 367.84
don't really care that much at checkup

368.0 --> 370.24
uh

371.6 --> 376.47900000000004
right yeah i had a really long

373.919 --> 378.479
conversation with good servant

376.479 --> 379.68
and then kind of the second half of that

378.479 --> 382.71999999999997
conversation re

379.68 --> 383.28000000000003
we recorded so that's on good servant

382.72 --> 386.56
channel

383.28 --> 389.84
check him out it's a

386.56 --> 394.479
a late evening

389.84 --> 397.44
show lasted about what is it 40 minutes

394.479 --> 400.479
but it was pretty intense uh yeah we

397.44 --> 400.479
discussed the whole

401.199 --> 406.319
end time situation and i

404.24 --> 409.84000000000003
yeah you'll put put a link that's that's

406.319 --> 409.84000000000003
good uh

412.56 --> 416.639
but yeah it's basically rehashing what i

414.56 --> 420.16
already went through and

416.639 --> 421.599
yeah good servant seems to be very

420.16 --> 423.36
i don't know i thought it was weird that

421.599 --> 425.36
you titled it even afterwards like

423.36 --> 428.639
you're trying to convince me why

425.36 --> 431.44
are you sure it is is it important to

428.639 --> 431.44
convince me

432.319 --> 436.08000000000004
isn't it better to figure out whether it

435.28 --> 439.19899999999996
really is

436.08 --> 440.0
or isn't and what that means whether it

439.199 --> 443.039
is

440.0 --> 447.199
or whether it isn't

443.039 --> 447.199
yeah but yeah that's good servant for

448.84 --> 454.31899999999996
you

450.56 --> 456.479
i don't feel like i've like my

454.319 --> 459.44
ang like the lark apocalypse as i call

456.479 --> 464.08
it i don't think that's disproven

459.44 --> 466.4
just yet at least

464.08 --> 466.4
right

471.68 --> 479.84000000000003
dome live podcast today

475.28 --> 483.44
dome light what what is that

479.84 --> 484.23999999999995
nathan you know what michael jones is

483.44 --> 493.84
talking about

484.24 --> 493.84000000000003
in chat

496.0 --> 502.639
right anyway uh

499.52 --> 503.599
yeah other than that which it was yeah

502.639 --> 505.44
it's recorded so

503.599 --> 508.08
yeah i don't necessarily have to talk

505.44 --> 511.12
about the whole thing it's just there

508.08 --> 515.279
it kind of stands on its own

511.12 --> 515.279
oh paul on the plane podcast okay

517.519 --> 521.2
he calls that dome life that's so

519.76 --> 525.2
refining

521.2 --> 528.1600000000001
oh well uh

525.2 --> 530.8000000000001
also watched another netflix movie one

528.16 --> 533.92
that i had heard about

530.8 --> 535.68
a while ago but it kind of like didn't

533.92 --> 536.16
get my attention at the time but i

535.68 --> 541.8389999999999
watched

536.16 --> 544.88
the newer godzilla movie not the 90s one

541.839 --> 544.8800000000001
and yeah

545.519 --> 549.6
i had very mixed feelings about that

547.36 --> 551.6
movie especially because the beginning

549.6 --> 555.839
was just a giant

551.6 --> 559.76
it is really a nuclear energy reifying

555.839 --> 563.0400000000001
mind control project the entire thing

559.76 --> 564.88
although you know with godzilla

563.04 --> 567.12
that's supposed that's kind of what it

564.88 --> 568.16
is and i figured this out more and more

567.12 --> 571.279
now

568.16 --> 575.6
is that the godzilla is really a legend

571.279 --> 578.399
to reify the nuclear power

575.6 --> 579.6
spell because i don't think it works

578.399 --> 582.519
that way

579.6 --> 584.16
and they put all kinds of control yeah

582.519 --> 587.04
anti-conspiracy theorist

584.16 --> 588.16
little tricks in there first of all the

587.04 --> 591.1999999999999
conspiracy theorist

588.16 --> 593.36
dies so there's that

591.2 --> 594.8000000000001
and then it turns out he was right after

593.36 --> 598.9590000000001
all but

594.8 --> 600.88
yeah not because he didn't believe in it

598.959 --> 602.3199999999999
in nuclear power but because something

600.88 --> 605.04
else

602.32 --> 606.6400000000001
was going on that kind of explained all

605.04 --> 609.1999999999999
the weird

606.64 --> 612.3199999999999
little details like oh this nuclear

609.2 --> 616.72
disaster area has no radiation

612.32 --> 619.44
oh i think we kind of heard that before

616.72 --> 621.6800000000001
in the real world well in the movie they

619.44 --> 623.2
gave an explanation apparently some

621.68 --> 627.279
creature

623.2 --> 629.839
ate the radiation just sucked it

627.279 --> 631.6
off the land makes no damn sense right

629.839 --> 635.2790000000001
well they put it in there

631.6 --> 639.279
and when i saw that part it it hurt

635.279 --> 642.079
that hurt that was like that's a nasty

639.279 --> 643.76
spell that's information placement so

642.079 --> 646.7199999999999
clear

643.76 --> 650.24
and if you don't realize that there's

646.72 --> 650.24
issues with the nuclear power

650.48 --> 655.279
the way they explain how it works

652.32 --> 655.279
nuclear fission

655.519 --> 660.9590000000001
then if you don't realize that the movie

657.92 --> 662.8
is all good it's all kind of interesting

660.959 --> 664.56
but if you do know about that then it's

662.8 --> 667.92
like really a couple of

664.56 --> 668.3199999999999
stabs in the back but yeah other than

667.92 --> 670.56
that

668.32 --> 671.519
which is kind of like the first third

670.56 --> 674.079
the actual

671.519 --> 675.04
monster action yeah it was pretty damn

674.079 --> 677.279
amazing

675.04 --> 678.7199999999999
it would like the cgi was just really

677.279 --> 682.959
good

678.72 --> 682.9590000000001
but yeah that's that's hollywood

685.92 --> 692.399
all right

689.44 --> 692.399
yeah the last one

696.48 --> 699.519
i already said there's two well there's

698.48 --> 701.279
two godzilla's

699.519 --> 703.519
from hollywood that i know of one is

701.279 --> 706.56
from the 90s and one is from i don't

703.519 --> 706.5600000000001
know a few years ago

707.839 --> 712.519
it's yeah although that this movie is

710.839 --> 715.72
definitely

712.519 --> 717.36
military-centric very very

715.72 --> 719.6800000000001
military-centric

717.36 --> 721.6
and they're grafting in all kinds of

719.68 --> 724.4799999999999
conspiracy

721.6 --> 726.5600000000001
conceptions and all that for people to

724.48 --> 727.9200000000001
absorb and make their own

726.56 --> 730.4799999999999
that's kind of what the trick they're

727.92 --> 734.16
trying to pull there

730.48 --> 736.399
it's there is a prequel okay

734.16 --> 736.399
sure

738.24 --> 742.16
i don't know i'm not that much of a

740.0 --> 744.8
super fan of godzilla

742.16 --> 747.12
you know i think i think like in between

744.8 --> 749.279
it all in between all the movie legacies

747.12 --> 750.0
yeah it's a pretty cool concept and hey

749.279 --> 754.16
it's like

750.0 --> 757.36
ideal for cgi extravaganza

754.16 --> 759.519
movies you know disaster just to give a

757.36 --> 761.6800000000001
good excuse to show some disaster kind

759.519 --> 765.36
of situation

761.68 --> 768.2399999999999
so yeah

765.36 --> 768.24
not against it

769.04 --> 772.88
i thought that the 90s one was actually

771.2 --> 776.32
really hilarious

772.88 --> 778.399
and silly but it wasn't even that bad

776.32 --> 780.24
for the time like the cgi was pretty

778.399 --> 786.8
damn amazing

780.24 --> 789.76
for the 90s

786.8 --> 792.0
with the worm guy and that's a lot of

789.76 --> 793.76
fish and all that

792.0 --> 795.519
all right but this movie is much more

793.76 --> 797.519
serious there's there's really no

795.519 --> 801.839
com comedic elements in there at all

797.519 --> 801.839
it's a very serious movie

802.079 --> 804.88
more dramatic

812.24 --> 815.839
right so i watched that

818.16 --> 824.88
right i also saw that thank you for

821.44 --> 824.8800000000001
sharing the show good servant

825.839 --> 830.24
yeah flat side shared a video from a

828.72 --> 832.639
sniper

830.24 --> 834.8
it's not a flatter of it's not about fly

832.639 --> 837.92
earth it's just about the sniper

834.8 --> 842.399
gun and all that and yeah you get a lo

837.92 --> 847.4399999999999
you get all the details live presented

842.399 --> 847.44
like with data of the specs and all that

848.079 --> 851.92
and yeah it's interesting to see how

850.399 --> 853.68
that works

851.92 --> 855.8389999999999
but also yeah it's very distinct that

853.68 --> 857.76
they're definitely not correcting for

855.839 --> 858.8000000000001
coriolis effect that was kind of flat so

857.76 --> 862.24
it's pointless

858.8 --> 866.399
to post it i think yeah they don't

862.24 --> 870.8
life demonstrated no mention of coriolis

866.399 --> 874.32
at all although they didn't seek out to

870.8 --> 877.529
disprove it specifically

874.32 --> 877.529
[Music]

881.24 --> 887.279
2014 i don't know

884.639 --> 888.8
is that it might be the one not probably

887.279 --> 891.36
not this one's later

888.8 --> 894.24
i think this one is 2018 or something i

891.36 --> 899.839
don't know i didn't check

894.24 --> 899.839
ah let me check an imdb

906.43 --> 910.53
[Music]

918.48 --> 926.0790000000001
all right this oh it's actually called

920.399 --> 929.04
godzilla king of the monsters i think

926.079 --> 929.04
let me double check

930.399 --> 943.33
is it or is that a new one

940.28 --> 943.3299999999999
[Music]

945.839 --> 957.759
i don't recognize

954.72 --> 957.759
now this should be it

958.959 --> 963.92
okay i guess i'll watch the trailer see

961.36 --> 969.839
if i recognize it

963.92 --> 969.8389999999999
i'm gonna watch it silent though

980.959 --> 983.8389999999999
okay

984.0 --> 986.24
right

990.0 --> 994.079
what okay this is definitely a different

993.04 --> 996.56
one

994.079 --> 997.5999999999999
just saw multiple multiple-headed dragon

996.56 --> 999.5999999999999
in there what the hell

997.6 --> 1001.44
okay that was definitely not in this

999.6 --> 1003.839
movie so this one was another

1001.44 --> 1006.48
what another one how many godzilla

1003.839 --> 1006.48
movies are there

1008.839 --> 1011.839
sheesh

1013.11 --> 1016.299
[Music]

1021.44 --> 1024.88
then it must have been the 2040 one that

1024.64 --> 1029.76
i

1024.88 --> 1029.7600000000002
seen huh

1036.72 --> 1042.0
yeah i recognized the actor yep it was

1039.919 --> 1045.439
the 2014 one

1042.0 --> 1045.839
all right all right so there's a new one

1045.439 --> 1050.16
oh

1045.839 --> 1050.1599999999999
goody uh

1050.48 --> 1054.72
well for 2040 the cgi is damn good then

1054.32 --> 1058.799
even

1054.72 --> 1058.799
that's really good for that time even

1061.6 --> 1068.24
right yes sir check oh

1064.64 --> 1071.1200000000001
it is look dude the godzilla these

1068.24 --> 1073.36
movies the 2014 one and if this new one

1071.12 --> 1076.32
is very much like that

1073.36 --> 1079.4399999999998
you know what it really is it's

1076.32 --> 1082.96
basically the power rangers and fights

1079.44 --> 1086.0
but super high tech that's what it is

1082.96 --> 1088.4
giant monsters or yeah

1086.0 --> 1090.08
in this case not a giant robot giant

1088.4 --> 1092.5590000000002
monsters giant robots

1090.08 --> 1094.3999999999999
like pacific rim is giant robots in this

1092.559 --> 1096.24
case it's giant monsters fighting in

1094.4 --> 1109.6000000000001
cities trashing it all and

1096.24 --> 1113.36
yeah it's a whole new genre

1109.6 --> 1117.28
they use compressed air what

1113.36 --> 1119.039
no i don't think nuclear power is fake

1117.28 --> 1123.84
uh yo lyric

1119.039 --> 1123.84
i just think that the radioactive

1124.4 --> 1129.76
things that surround it the

1127.6 --> 1132.8799999999999
dangers in the radioactive waste i think

1129.76 --> 1136.0
that that is probably a scam

1132.88 --> 1139.5200000000002
but as far as i've heard

1136.0 --> 1142.72
from various angles the uranium they use

1139.52 --> 1146.0
yeah it's it just heats water just

1142.72 --> 1149.3600000000001
eats water that's it so it's all

1146.0 --> 1149.36
basically steam powered

1149.84 --> 1153.36
on that material and that's it

1153.919 --> 1162.96
and i guess that it is actually

1157.36 --> 1162.9599999999998
really safe so you know from

1163.039 --> 1168.24
from a let's say a controller

1166.48 --> 1171.52
perspective

1168.24 --> 1173.2
they might have even considered

1171.52 --> 1175.039
they'll consider they might have

1173.2 --> 1178.96
basically chosen the whole

1175.039 --> 1181.52
nuclear legacy

1178.96 --> 1182.08
with power plants that they did it on

1181.52 --> 1186.799
purpose

1182.08 --> 1190.08
because if they didn't then

1186.799 --> 1191.12
yeah uranium you know people might start

1190.08 --> 1193.6
to treat

1191.12 --> 1194.4799999999998
nuclear power plants as just a giant

1193.6 --> 1196.9599999999998
bank

1194.48 --> 1199.2
you know people would you know countries

1196.96 --> 1203.679
might be more easily inclined to just

1199.2 --> 1203.679
rob uranium and [ __ ] see

1204.0 --> 1208.96
so they're doing it to kind of keep the

1206.96 --> 1212.559
setup safe so it's not as

1208.96 --> 1215.28
it won't become as much of a target

1212.559 --> 1216.48
for theft because uranium is pretty

1215.28 --> 1220.08
valuable

1216.48 --> 1224.0
as a resource so that's my

1220.08 --> 1225.84
conception about it why they did it

1224.0 --> 1227.12
and then of course the whole nuclear

1225.84 --> 1230.08
weaponry as a

1227.12 --> 1231.4399999999998
as a yeah as a giant military threat

1230.08 --> 1235.84
system

1231.44 --> 1235.8400000000001
agreed upon

1241.76 --> 1247.679
but yeah yo lemmer lyric it's it's not

1245.44 --> 1248.72
compressed air there is stuff happening

1247.679 --> 1251.3600000000001
it's not just a

1248.72 --> 1254.559
cover story for a basic mechanism

1251.36 --> 1263.84
there's definitely a material heating

1254.559 --> 1263.84
water pretty sure of that

1271.36 --> 1278.6789999999999
well sir check oh don't worry about that

1276.24 --> 1280.72
i might yeah i have download

1278.679 --> 1283.6000000000001
capabilities

1280.72 --> 1285.44
through the opera browser so i can

1283.6 --> 1288.84
actually download movies

1285.44 --> 1291.8400000000001
don't worry about it but thanks for the

1288.84 --> 1291.84
offer

1293.44 --> 1298.0800000000002
does helium come from uranium poof

1299.12 --> 1305.84
uh yo larrick

1302.24 --> 1305.84
i don't know does it

1306.24 --> 1310.799
i think that hydrogen does tend to come

1308.4 --> 1310.799
from it

1311.44 --> 1319.8400000000001
i'm not entirely sure

1329.52 --> 1334.0
right yeah i'm not a look i might may

1331.919 --> 1334.88
know some things about metals and all

1334.0 --> 1337.36
that

1334.88 --> 1340.48
when come i'm not a nuclear physicist

1337.36 --> 1340.4799999999998
not even a hobbyist

1342.799 --> 1346.0
so i technically i don't even know all

1344.96 --> 1348.559
the details of how

1346.0 --> 1349.36
it's officially supposed to be working

1348.559 --> 1351.84
let alone

1349.36 --> 1353.6789999999999
of yeah what of that is cover story what

1351.84 --> 1358.6399999999999
is not real what is

1353.679 --> 1358.64
this yeah bar what i've basically heard

1358.96 --> 1365.28
people that yeah basically came out said

1362.32 --> 1366.3999999999999
like no it's not freaking dangerous at

1365.28 --> 1367.36
all

1366.4 --> 1370.52
that's it

1367.36 --> 1370.52
[Music]

1370.64 --> 1375.8400000000001
alright see you later nathan have a good

1372.96 --> 1375.8400000000001
show i'll be there

1376.48 --> 1379.589
[Music]

1401.039 --> 1406.76
yeah wind energy is a mess

1404.48 --> 1409.3600000000001
you know wind wind energy

1406.76 --> 1412.559
[Music]

1409.36 --> 1414.24
like solar energy it's a nice extra it's

1412.559 --> 1418.1589999999999
like a

1414.24 --> 1418.799
a backup source that's kind of uh that's

1418.159 --> 1420.7990000000002
good

1418.799 --> 1422.08
it's good to have the extra backup

1420.799 --> 1425.36
source

1422.08 --> 1429.1999999999998
but in my opinion it should never be

1425.36 --> 1431.52
a exclusive power source that yeah

1429.2 --> 1434.32
everybody's only gonna get it from those

1431.52 --> 1437.52
systems from wind energy and

1434.32 --> 1440.1589999999999
solar energy because there's a lot of

1437.52 --> 1444.96
problems with it

1440.159 --> 1446.96
there's enormous spikes and

1444.96 --> 1449.6000000000001
periods where it's just completely dead

1446.96 --> 1452.96
and there it you can't

1449.6 --> 1454.6399999999999
save up energy enough

1452.96 --> 1456.96
to make that all work so there's a lot

1454.64 --> 1461.44
of problems with

1456.96 --> 1464.72
supposedly durable exclusive energy

1461.44 --> 1468.0
networks but it's good to have

1464.72 --> 1469.76
besides just fossil fuel based systems

1468.0 --> 1473.84
or nuclear power

1469.76 --> 1473.84
it's good to have it as an extra

1475.12 --> 1482.4799999999998
and yeah for certain look it's

1478.799 --> 1484.24
it's yeah like with solar energy

1482.48 --> 1486.0
and even wind energy but especially

1484.24 --> 1489.36
solar you know it's good for

1486.0 --> 1493.12
very small loop system it's good

1489.36 --> 1496.24
to get very specific

1493.12 --> 1498.0
power grid independent systems that

1496.24 --> 1500.64
aren't supposed to be running

1498.0 --> 1502.08
all day like engines that just have to

1500.64 --> 1505.2
go running all day

1502.08 --> 1505.52
but that like devices that do on them on

1505.2 --> 1508.88
the

1505.52 --> 1511.84
themselves just their function

1508.88 --> 1512.64
that they work in periodically so that

1511.84 --> 1516.1589999999999
yeah the

1512.64 --> 1520.0
the electric peaks

1516.159 --> 1520.48
and bottoms don't affect it as much

1520.0 --> 1523.919
because

1520.48 --> 1525.84
the device is simply adapted to that

1523.919 --> 1528.7990000000002
specifically and then it can just run

1525.84 --> 1531.6789999999999
independently forever now that's a good

1528.799 --> 1531.679
way to use it too

1531.76 --> 1543.84
or again just as a power backup

1535.2 --> 1543.8400000000001
to add on locally

1548.08 --> 1556.08
baking soda and asset

1551.36 --> 1557.9189999999999
ascetic acid okay

1556.08 --> 1560.3999999999999
that's weird didn't know that george

1557.919 --> 1560.4
sanford

1564.74 --> 1568.569
[Music]

1568.84 --> 1571.84
hmm

1582.0 --> 1585.84
hey good morning julia pavin

1613.279 --> 1620.0
aren't able to get rotating power what

1616.96 --> 1622.24
i don't know where you got that overlap

1620.0 --> 1627.84
but i do know that the typical windmills

1622.24 --> 1627.84
aren't very efficient

1628.48 --> 1631.76
and they're extremely they're a big

1630.96 --> 1634.64
pollutant

1631.76 --> 1636.48
and they give off uh like cymatic

1634.64 --> 1639.3600000000001
pollution

1636.48 --> 1640.3990000000001
like the constant shock waves the wind

1639.36 --> 1644.1589999999999
breaking

1640.399 --> 1644.1589999999999
is actually very disruptive

1648.159 --> 1652.3990000000001
so standard windmills are not a good

1650.159 --> 1652.3990000000001
thing

1653.679 --> 1669.8400000000001
especially if you have a lot of them

1675.76 --> 1679.36
okay anime thanks for the update yeah

1678.48 --> 1681.1200000000001
somebody already

1679.36 --> 1682.4799999999998
said that i don't know if that is

1681.12 --> 1685.039
actually true i don't know

1682.48 --> 1687.3600000000001
how many people actually have tested

1685.039 --> 1692.399
that themselves

1687.36 --> 1692.399
like did any high chemistry students or

1692.88 --> 1697.5200000000002
nuclear physics students actually get to

1695.76 --> 1701.039
test it like oh here's a

1697.52 --> 1702.399
a piece of uranium like put your suits

1701.039 --> 1704.24
on

1702.399 --> 1705.84
then we're gonna put it in this box and

1704.24 --> 1708.559
now measure like

1705.84 --> 1711.279
the air content and just okay it's

1708.559 --> 1712.8799999999999
normal error right okay we close it

1711.279 --> 1714.799
and then you wait an hour and then you

1712.88 --> 1717.8400000000001
check again okay look there's a

1714.799 --> 1719.84
significant percentage of

1717.84 --> 1721.9189999999999
helium or something in there now look

1719.84 --> 1725.279
that would be

1721.919 --> 1728.3200000000002
a real test and if it's just

1725.279 --> 1731.279
said like yeah technically it's

1728.32 --> 1733.12
supposed to create helium that's all

1731.279 --> 1736.84
really nice so did anybody

1733.12 --> 1739.279
actually empirically confirm that's the

1736.84 --> 1740.48
case

1739.279 --> 1742.48
i don't know i don't know a lot of

1740.48 --> 1745.3600000000001
nuclear physicists so

1742.48 --> 1748.159
as in any that i can confirm that there

1745.36 --> 1748.1589999999999
really are that

1749.44 --> 1752.799
just people that have learned about it

1751.6 --> 1756.7199999999998
and then consider

1752.799 --> 1756.72
themselves to be nuclear physicists

1760.24 --> 1769.88
and it's in the past

1766.82 --> 1769.8799999999999
[Music]

1790.399 --> 1794.1589999999999
yeah i guess we're talking about power

1792.48 --> 1796.3990000000001
stations now

1794.159 --> 1796.3990000000001
and

1804.64 --> 1810.0800000000002
no i did not watch the chernobyl series

1807.12 --> 1814.1589999999999
i heard a lot about it

1810.08 --> 1814.1589999999999
it's more reification

1815.679 --> 1823.8400000000001
or was it like a replacement story

1826.0 --> 1829.2
i don't know i've heard mentions about

1828.96 --> 1832.559
it

1829.2 --> 1837.8400000000001
and alex jones reported on it even

1832.559 --> 1837.84
one time and i haven't watched it

1845.44 --> 1851.8400000000001
so the russians didn't like it well

1848.559 --> 1851.84
surprise surprise

1852.96 --> 1857.039
yeah hollywood is not uh you might have

1855.679 --> 1860.5590000000002
taken some notice that

1857.039 --> 1861.76
overall hollywood isn't really making

1860.559 --> 1865.76
russians look out

1861.76 --> 1868.799
to be very friendly ever

1865.76 --> 1868.799
like ever

1869.919 --> 1874.0
except during soviet russia then they're

1871.919 --> 1875.8400000000001
just oh they

1874.0 --> 1877.679
you know they they didn't know any

1875.84 --> 1879.84
better but now

1877.679 --> 1881.76
now they're all nazis all of a sudden

1879.84 --> 1884.1589999999999
sort of

1881.76 --> 1886.1589999999999
but yeah they're they're russians it's

1884.159 --> 1889.519
like the russians

1886.159 --> 1893.8400000000001
like the next level nazis to the liberal

1889.519 --> 1893.84
extreme political left

1897.2 --> 1907.8400000000001
and that reflects itself in a lot of

1899.12 --> 1907.84
hollywood products

1907.97 --> 1911.029
[Music]

1916.72 --> 1920.0
yeah george sanford heard about that i

1919.36 --> 1923.039
think if this

1920.0 --> 1926.0
keeps up you know chernobyl

1923.039 --> 1926.96
who knows maybe like in in a few years

1926.0 --> 1929.12
there will be

1926.96 --> 1934.08
chernobyl might just be a yearly

1929.12 --> 1937.84
festivity ground

1934.08 --> 1939.76
serious why not it's it's very peaceful

1937.84 --> 1942.799
very calm and just

1939.76 --> 1942.799
would i guess

1942.96 --> 1947.519
yeah once people start to figure out

1944.72 --> 1949.2
what's really going on

1947.519 --> 1951.44
i would typically imagine that it would

1949.2 --> 1953.1200000000001
just become a giant hippie get-together

1951.44 --> 1954.48
place where they would have festivals

1953.12 --> 1956.8799999999999
every year and literally

1954.48 --> 1963.84
everybody would leave them alone but it

1956.88 --> 1963.8400000000001
could become damn big

1964.48 --> 1970.159
i don't know it's just the concept i

1966.88 --> 1970.159
don't know if they're actually gonna do

1974.84 --> 1977.84
that

1981.519 --> 1991.84
but yeah nature itself doesn't seem to

1984.24 --> 1991.84
have a lot of trouble in the chernobyl

2009.41 --> 2018.48
[Music]

2016.84 --> 2019.9189999999999
right

2018.48 --> 2021.519
yeah i know what you mean sir chuckle

2019.919 --> 2025.039
it's always interesting to see

2021.519 --> 2028.48
when nature starts to reclaim

2025.039 --> 2029.679
architecture and all that you know just

2028.48 --> 2033.76
like those places

2029.679 --> 2037.519
was it in india or yeah east asia

2033.76 --> 2039.519
all these ancient stone

2037.519 --> 2040.559
temple situations that are then just

2039.519 --> 2043.1200000000001
completely

2040.559 --> 2046.0
covered up by giant giant roots yeah

2043.12 --> 2049.2
that's pretty damn majestic

2046.0 --> 2049.2
fascinating to see that

2050.159 --> 2064.19
hey you man

2061.0 --> 2064.19
[Music]

2072.24 --> 2075.839
right anyway

2086.56 --> 2089.599
yeah i don't have a lot really to talk

2088.56 --> 2091.7599999999998
about on them

2089.599 --> 2093.119
we're already talking about but i did

2091.76 --> 2096.32
have like a

2093.119 --> 2099.04
in between moment like last night man

2096.32 --> 2099.44
it was really weird i got it seemed like

2099.04 --> 2103.839
i

2099.44 --> 2103.839
got like

2104.16 --> 2109.359
rushed like by the dark forces again

2107.52 --> 2111.2
they tried to break in they tried to

2109.359 --> 2113.119
break into my mind again it's almost

2111.2 --> 2116.16
like they're trying to hack me

2113.119 --> 2119.2000000000003
spiritually sometimes

2116.16 --> 2121.2
when i roll too far

2119.2 --> 2122.96
you know because i yeah stay

2121.2 --> 2124.8799999999997
intellectually aware

2122.96 --> 2126.56
if you just touch upon the dark

2124.88 --> 2128.1600000000003
literally touch upon it even just

2126.56 --> 2131.2
conceptually

2128.16 --> 2133.1189999999997
then eventually it gets a grip on you

2131.2 --> 2135.359
instead of the other way around it's so

2133.119 --> 2137.28
freaky i know this happens to me

2135.359 --> 2138.7999999999997
sometimes it doesn't happen as much as

2137.28 --> 2140.6400000000003
it used to

2138.8 --> 2142.4
and of course i have my healer now that

2140.64 --> 2145.2
often helps if

2142.4 --> 2146.2400000000002
it yeah it gets really physical side

2145.2 --> 2148.48
effects and all that

2146.24 --> 2150.56
because it does it does definitely for

2148.48 --> 2154.4
me it does

2150.56 --> 2159.839
like for me the darkness is just

2154.4 --> 2159.839
detectable by physical response

2160.64 --> 2166.56
so but yeah i managed to get out of that

2164.32 --> 2168.2400000000002
and yeah it's always weird when that

2166.56 --> 2170.0
happens and then the next morning you

2168.24 --> 2171.52
wake up and suddenly it's super great

2170.0 --> 2174.64
weather

2171.52 --> 2174.64
it's really weird to me

2178.72 --> 2183.1189999999997
but it did help a lot waking up to good

2184.839 --> 2187.839
weather

2193.599 --> 2201.839
uh no emmanuel

2196.72 --> 2201.839
never heard of it

2204.56 --> 2209.52
what where are you getting that's here

2212.839 --> 2215.839
chico

2218.079 --> 2220.4
what

2221.44 --> 2229.839
that doesn't make a whole lot of sense

2223.599 --> 2229.839
here chico

2240.16 --> 2243.839
a video included really

2256.72 --> 2258.9599999999996
what

2261.04 --> 2266.88
so was the woman alive or

2264.079 --> 2268.96
was she dead and did the snake take up

2266.88 --> 2271.839
residence in her body or something what

2268.96 --> 2271.839
the [ __ ]

2281.599 --> 2285.839
that's just absurd

2292.8 --> 2299.8390000000004
was there any explanation as to how that

2296.079 --> 2299.8390000000004
situation came to be

2310.839 --> 2316.56
anyone

2312.72 --> 2320.8799999999997
asleep that what

2316.56 --> 2321.44
a sleep or like in a half a coma type

2320.88 --> 2323.52
sleep

2321.44 --> 2325.599
like how can you sleep through like a

2323.52 --> 2326.24
giant creature just crawling into your

2325.599 --> 2340.4
mouth that's

2326.24 --> 2342.4799999999996
absolutely absurd

2340.4 --> 2344.96
and how the [ __ ] could you still be

2342.48 --> 2344.96
alive

2347.599 --> 2355.839
it sounds like it's just a [ __ ]

2349.839 --> 2355.839
story really to freak people out

2356.079 --> 2359.8390000000004
oh great video

2366.839 --> 2369.839
goodie

2379.52 --> 2383.839
what so

2385.119 --> 2389.52
what kind of a weird [ __ ] snake is

2387.44 --> 2392.0
that

2389.52 --> 2393.119
so it did crawl inside okay it's not

2392.0 --> 2411.839
that big a snake

2393.119 --> 2411.839
though i never heard of that

2413.839 --> 2420.0
okay watch the video i don't know man

2416.88 --> 2422.88
i'm not convinced not convinced at all

2420.0 --> 2425.04
and besides it didn't look alive

2422.88 --> 2427.6800000000003
so what did she did that thing crawl

2425.04 --> 2432.56
into her to die

2427.68 --> 2432.56
or to go into hibernation what the [ __ ]

2434.16 --> 2437.44
i don't know man it sounds more like she

2436.24 --> 2439.359
just

2437.44 --> 2441.76
i don't know got really drunk and then

2439.359 --> 2442.48
in a bed swallowed a snake or something

2441.76 --> 2445.8390000000004
that seems

2442.48 --> 2447.76
more likely to me than that a creature

2445.839 --> 2448.72
would actually crawl into a human's

2447.76 --> 2452.96
mouth like that

2448.72 --> 2456.48
that's ridiculous snakes don't do that

2452.96 --> 2458.2400000000002
like an eel would do that with a dead

2456.48 --> 2462.079
creature perhaps

2458.24 --> 2462.64
you know but a land just a snake don't

2462.079 --> 2465.6800000000003
that

2462.64 --> 2468.24
never heard of that it's absolutely

2465.68 --> 2468.24
absurd

2472.96 --> 2476.2400000000002
ah michael jones yeah

2477.119 --> 2481.04
yeah the huge fight was pretty damn

2479.44 --> 2484.4
impressive wasn't it

2481.04 --> 2486.72
i agreed although the the

2484.4 --> 2488.4
the premise is ridiculous like can you

2486.72 --> 2489.4399999999996
imagine something like that happening in

2488.4 --> 2491.839
a modern school

2489.44 --> 2491.839
this is

2492.56 --> 2495.92
yeah you know otherwise you can't have

2494.96 --> 2509.839
any good fights

2495.92 --> 2509.839
it can't be too real

2532.16 --> 2537.839
yeah lee ratpath i feel ya

2558.88 --> 2562.6400000000003
i don't know man it just seems more

2560.56 --> 2565.839
likely that she would

2562.64 --> 2566.4
in a super crazy move or whatever in a

2565.839 --> 2569.52
bad

2566.4 --> 2571.119
swallow a snake probably dead

2569.52 --> 2574.079
but just to freak people out or

2571.119 --> 2579.839
something and that yeah

2574.079 --> 2579.8390000000004
then it didn't fall too great

2580.0 --> 2584.16
i think that's more likely than that's

2582.48 --> 2587.839
actually a naturally

2584.16 --> 2587.839
natural situation

2588.079 --> 2593.8390000000004
looks man-made situation

2618.839 --> 2624.16
yeah let me take another look at that

2621.76 --> 2624.1600000000003
video

2624.4 --> 2635.839
i said because

2628.079 --> 2635.8390000000004
oh god stupid advertising

2651.04 --> 2654.0
this is a trick

2655.28 --> 2659.119
the camera is specifically sticking to

2657.599 --> 2661.119
the side so you can't

2659.119 --> 2664.2400000000002
be absolutely sure they're actually

2661.119 --> 2666.079
pulling it out of her mouth

2664.24 --> 2668.24
although yeah the woman does give a

2666.079 --> 2670.0
genuinely creeped out look after she

2668.24 --> 2673.5989999999997
pulled it out

2670.0 --> 2675.52
but yeah the way the camera angle was

2673.599 --> 2678.1600000000003
there's no absolute proof that it's

2675.52 --> 2680.16
actually being pulled out of her mouth

2678.16 --> 2683.2799999999997
did you take notice of that it's a

2680.16 --> 2685.1189999999997
perfect side on view

2683.28 --> 2687.599
literally the oldest trick in the book

2685.119 --> 2691.119
could be taken from beside it

2687.599 --> 2693.2000000000003
from that angle so that's what i'm

2691.119 --> 2696.7200000000003
seeing in that video

2693.2 --> 2696.72
now that i'm taking a second look

2696.8 --> 2705.8390000000004
i think it's just a magician's trick

2708.56 --> 2713.92
what randy's post to me what post

2715.119 --> 2719.839
i know what you're talking about

2728.64 --> 2733.839
might be michael jones you're gonna

2730.839 --> 2733.839
point

2745.359 --> 2750.319
it's a tiny wombo i love that

2748.64 --> 2752.56
it's like ufos whenever there's

2750.319 --> 2753.2799999999997
something like that the only available

2752.56 --> 2756.319
cameras

2753.28 --> 2756.3190000000004
are potatoes

2756.74 --> 2764.9599999999996
[Laughter]

2761.28 --> 2764.96
thanks thanks for sharing that

2770.24 --> 2776.319
a community post

2774.24 --> 2778.64
yeah i wouldn't know man i'm not on his

2776.319 --> 2778.64
channel

2778.72 --> 2781.839
i'm not subscribed i don't watch i don't

2780.8 --> 2783.52
care

2781.839 --> 2788.72
if he has something to say then he can

2783.52 --> 2793.119
come to me

2788.72 --> 2793.1189999999997
yeah okay enough about that john bernard

2799.28 --> 2803.8390000000004
it's probably completely fake

2839.92 --> 2849.359
oh he wants to does he

2844.48 --> 2851.839
well that's too bad maybe you can just

2849.359 --> 2854.4
take one of his other cameras you know

2851.839 --> 2857.119
he's literally drowning in money and

2854.4 --> 2858.64
gadgets and [ __ ] he thinks it's so

2857.119 --> 2862.6400000000003
important then

2858.64 --> 2865.68
he can lend his camera to somebody else

2862.64 --> 2868.64
because this one he gave to me

2865.68 --> 2869.1189999999997
and he doesn't have anything to say

2868.64 --> 2871.1189999999997
about

2869.119 --> 2872.1600000000003
what i'm gonna do about it or if i'm

2871.119 --> 2876.1600000000003
gonna do nothing

2872.16 --> 2878.5589999999997
at all about it until i die nothing

2876.16 --> 2887.839
if i don't want to i will do nothing

2878.559 --> 2887.8390000000004
with it if i don't feel like it

2890.18 --> 2893.3799999999997
[Music]

2907.83 --> 2910.88
[Music]

2912.96 --> 2920.079
because if he gave it to me

2916.4 --> 2921.119
under conditions then i wouldn't have

2920.079 --> 2929.8390000000004
taken it

2921.119 --> 2929.839
literally i would not have taken it

2951.15 --> 2954.26
[Music]

2977.68 --> 2985.839
hey yeah i don't care

2988.01 --> 2991.119
[Music]

2999.44 --> 3006.0
look guys it's guaranteed that

3002.8 --> 3008.4
if at some point i'm gonna break away

3006.0 --> 3011.359
from this financial situation and

3008.4 --> 3012.079
hey i don't plan to literally live out

3011.359 --> 3015.2799999999997
my life

3012.079 --> 3019.119
exactly in like this setup

3015.28 --> 3021.2000000000003
i need money constantly never gonna get

3019.119 --> 3023.04
out of my social welfare

3021.2 --> 3024.7999999999997
always going to just be sitting in this

3023.04 --> 3026.64
room now i'm not gonna continue to do

3024.8 --> 3027.52
that for another 20 years if you know

3026.64 --> 3029.92
what i mean

3027.52 --> 3030.559
so if i'm going to actually at some

3029.92 --> 3033.2000000000003
point go

3030.559 --> 3034.7200000000003
to places like hey i'd like to visit new

3033.2 --> 3036.64
zealand sometimes

3034.72 --> 3038.0789999999997
if it doesn't turn into a giant

3036.64 --> 3041.44
concentration camp

3038.079 --> 3043.52
before that right and other places too

3041.44 --> 3044.0
i'd love to go somewhere sometime but

3043.52 --> 3047.68
that's

3044.0 --> 3048.72
a super luxury if i ever get to that

3047.68 --> 3051.44
point

3048.72 --> 3052.8799999999997
then you can be sure that i will take

3051.44 --> 3055.92
that thing with me

3052.88 --> 3060.319
make some really good shots but

3055.92 --> 3063.92
yeah i'm not going to wreck my life or

3060.319 --> 3065.119
feel yeah let myself be pushed around by

3063.92 --> 3068.319
some

3065.119 --> 3071.359
feel feeling that i am compelled to do

3068.319 --> 3074.0
things because somebody gave it to me

3071.359 --> 3076.96
right i'm not going to do that it's not

3074.0 --> 3083.839
how it will work i will not be pushed

3076.96 --> 3083.839
very simple

3094.16 --> 3098.16
ah the enemy can does randy have ballers

3096.319 --> 3101.92
working in his pr department

3098.16 --> 3111.839
department though you better believe it

3101.92 --> 3111.839
better believe it absolutely it does

3164.839 --> 3181.839
hmm

3167.04 --> 3181.839
all right

3183.2 --> 3195.839
all right

3196.16 --> 3202.24
right also i might at some point

3199.2 --> 3203.9199999999996
actually land it out but it's it would

3202.24 --> 3207.2799999999997
be to a person

3203.92 --> 3208.0
that i know is not necessarily for flat

3207.28 --> 3210.4
earth work

3208.0 --> 3211.28
but because yeah it's my friendly name

3210.4 --> 3214.48
because she's

3211.28 --> 3218.0
also pretty good a

3214.48 --> 3221.28
hobby foot photographer

3218.0 --> 3222.0
and yeah i showed her the thing so maybe

3221.28 --> 3224.1600000000003
at some point

3222.0 --> 3226.72
i will actually lend it out to her for

3224.16 --> 3226.72
for a few

3228.079 --> 3232.4
because yeah i'm not just gonna sit on

3230.16 --> 3233.52
it so nobody is gonna be able to use it

3232.4 --> 3236.64
but i don't feel

3233.52 --> 3242.0
obligated because yeah

3236.64 --> 3242.0
a gift is unconditional

3244.24 --> 3251.839
oh yeah

3259.359 --> 3264.5589999999997
yeah well you know all that manipulation

3262.319 --> 3265.92
from those freaky trolls that don't

3264.559 --> 3269.2000000000003
literally care

3265.92 --> 3271.28
they're just squirting

3269.2 --> 3274.24
because they found some kind of virtual

3271.28 --> 3278.2400000000002
reason discord

3274.24 --> 3280.3999999999996
yeah yeah to those people guys i'd

3278.24 --> 3283.839
rather on camera

3280.4 --> 3286.559
completely smash the thing

3283.839 --> 3287.599
then be peer pressured into doing things

3286.559 --> 3291.119
with it

3287.599 --> 3294.96
i'd rather destroy it

3291.119 --> 3296.96
all right now that i'm gonna do that

3294.96 --> 3298.96
because that would be a waste but just

3296.96 --> 3302.16
to show the priorities at it

3298.96 --> 3304.079
i'd rather destroy the camera

3302.16 --> 3306.72
than be peer pressured into doing

3304.079 --> 3321.8390000000004
something with it

3306.72 --> 3321.839
all right

3331.04 --> 3334.319
yes here check oh look it's all just a

3333.04 --> 3336.48
waste of time then

3334.319 --> 3337.44
no it doesn't really matter what i do

3336.48 --> 3340.2400000000002
with it

3337.44 --> 3341.76
it's in a way i should literally never

3340.24 --> 3344.16
have taken this camera

3341.76 --> 3346.3190000000004
but i didn't know yet what a disgusting

3344.16 --> 3348.8799999999997
piece of [ __ ] he really was

3346.319 --> 3349.92
that he really is a nasty wannabe

3348.88 --> 3353.359
grabbler

3349.92 --> 3357.04
scumbag that

3353.359 --> 3362.48
doesn't have a real spirit anymore

3357.04 --> 3366.48
it's just a scumbag acting all day long

3362.48 --> 3367.28
and just pushing playing puppeteer with

3366.48 --> 3370.079
things that

3367.28 --> 3372.4
that's definitely not gonna do anything

3370.079 --> 3372.4
good

3373.119 --> 3376.88
and i shouldn't have taken it because if

3374.64 --> 3379.5989999999997
i hadn't if i hadn't taken it then

3376.88 --> 3380.88
yeah there would be no troll army of his

3379.599 --> 3383.76
whining about it

3380.88 --> 3384.4
trolling people because he's just out

3383.76 --> 3387.6800000000003
there

3384.4 --> 3389.839
to find other people that don't bow to

3387.68 --> 3392.5589999999997
his

3389.839 --> 3394.72
and then try to destroy them demoralize

3392.559 --> 3397.92
them with his shitty troll army

3394.72 --> 3400.3999999999996
just like all the baller scumbags right

3397.92 --> 3400.4
ranty

3402.839 --> 3405.839
huh

3410.4 --> 3414.2400000000002
now of course if i hadn't taken it i

3412.079 --> 3417.2000000000003
wouldn't have had a couple of pretty

3414.24 --> 3420.799
amazing shots so that would have been

3417.2 --> 3423.52
too bad i did get like the the

3420.799 --> 3424.48
play airplane flying right through the

3423.52 --> 3426.16
moon as i

3424.48 --> 3427.68
had a really still shot of it that was

3426.16 --> 3430.96
pretty awesome

3427.68 --> 3433.839
uh that shot wouldn't have existed

3430.96 --> 3433.839
that's pretty much it

3461.359 --> 3467.7599999999998
i'm sure he's nice to you good servant

3464.559 --> 3468.3190000000004
sure he is you know because he thinks

3467.76 --> 3471.44
that

3468.319 --> 3475.2799999999997
you're so nice you'll forgive his

3471.44 --> 3477.44
sickness and you'll be that guy

3475.28 --> 3479.599
standing over the swamp and think oh

3477.44 --> 3482.319
yeah he's so great

3479.599 --> 3485.44
yeah as he's pulling you in the swamp

3482.319 --> 3485.44
remember what i told you

3485.92 --> 3489.839
yeah that's what he does

3492.72 --> 3495.9199999999996
it's what he tried to do to me that's

3494.88 --> 3498.96
what he tried to do

3495.92 --> 3503.839
tony does it with everyone because he

3498.96 --> 3503.839
is a wannabe grabbler

3579.28 --> 3584.3190000000004
yeah you know and if he wasn't then

3584.559 --> 3592.1600000000003
then yeah he wouldn't have

3587.599 --> 3596.4
trolls bothering other people

3592.16 --> 3596.3999999999996
and dragging people to him like that

3598.839 --> 3603.67
no

3600.43 --> 3603.6699999999996
[Music]

3604.16 --> 3607.2799999999997
right yeah good servant sure i'm a good

3606.4 --> 3610.559
person

3607.28 --> 3612.48
i do my best i don't consider myself a

3610.559 --> 3615.8390000000004
nice person anymore though

3612.48 --> 3619.04
i grew out of that realized that

3615.839 --> 3622.0789999999997
just being nice and never going past

3619.04 --> 3623.7599999999998
it simply makes you into subservient

3622.079 --> 3627.2000000000003
slave to somebody else that

3623.76 --> 3629.8390000000004
will know how to abuse you for it

3627.2 --> 3629.839
right

3631.68 --> 3634.799
i'm sure you have plenty of experience

3634.0 --> 3637.119
with that

3634.799 --> 3639.28
and do know how to overcome it you're

3637.119 --> 3641.52
still holding on though

3639.28 --> 3643.119
whatever that means it's purely up to

3641.52 --> 3645.44
you

3643.119 --> 3646.319
from a grim perspective maybe you need

3645.44 --> 3648.88
more life

3646.319 --> 3650.0
punishment do you finally learn the

3648.88 --> 3653.119
lesson

3650.0 --> 3654.799
that's from my perspective or maybe it

3653.119 --> 3656.1600000000003
simply works that if you just get too

3654.799 --> 3659.359
much punishment you just

3656.16 --> 3659.359
can't be nice anymore

3662.079 --> 3671.119
because i used to be extremely forgiving

3665.2 --> 3674.3999999999996
like i would blind myself

3671.119 --> 3677.839
to people's dark flaws and

3674.4 --> 3679.6800000000003
mistakes but i didn't know the borders

3677.839 --> 3681.7599999999998
hit you i didn't know the consequences

3679.68 --> 3685.04
of the levels and the energy output and

3681.76 --> 3687.0400000000004
how it all worked i just oversimplified

3685.04 --> 3689.2799999999997
and then started ignoring almost

3687.04 --> 3692.0
everything

3689.28 --> 3693.76
until i just could realize eventually

3692.0 --> 3695.599
finally that it was

3693.76 --> 3698.4
only a waste of energy and time that

3695.599 --> 3700.4
they would never change

3698.4 --> 3702.0
and that actually they had literally

3700.4 --> 3705.839
been using

3702.0 --> 3708.72
my good will and my belief in that

3705.839 --> 3712.4
everyone can be better

3708.72 --> 3714.64
to drag me into misery that's what they

3712.4 --> 3714.64
did

3721.28 --> 3724.88
and then when you realize afterward that

3723.119 --> 3730.559
it's your own fault

3724.88 --> 3730.559
right yeah that's when the penny drops

3730.96 --> 3734.88
if you get hurt from being nice it's

3733.119 --> 3738.1600000000003
your own damn fault

3734.88 --> 3741.52
should have been more vigilant niceness

3738.16 --> 3744.799
is a luxury it's what it's what comes

3741.52 --> 3748.0
after order is established

3744.799 --> 3748.0
that's how i see it now

3748.96 --> 3752.4
right anyway i'm gonna run out the show

3751.52 --> 3754.4
