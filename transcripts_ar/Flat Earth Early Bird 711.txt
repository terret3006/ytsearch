75.759 --> 80.479
it's getting a little tight usually you

78.4 --> 84.0
guys always come through

80.479 --> 84.479
but yeah it's like this monthly cycle it

84.0 --> 88.479
happens

84.479 --> 91.52
every time really no matter what i do

88.479 --> 94.32
but yeah i'm still

91.52 --> 97.119
holding out right the weather again

94.32 --> 97.119
today is

97.2 --> 106.0
look at that

101.68 --> 106.0
featuresque as they say

109.119 --> 114.88
beautiful bright sun it's actually a

111.2 --> 117.36
little colder than it was yesterday

114.88 --> 119.6
and i think that in last night i'm not

117.36 --> 120.479
sure though but i think it even froze a

119.6 --> 123.52
little

120.479 --> 126.56
it did feel like it was very cold

123.52 --> 130.56
although it might have just stuck to

126.56 --> 130.56
water cold like almost freezing

130.64 --> 134.64
because i didn't see any actual frost

133.68 --> 136.959
anywhere

134.64 --> 137.83999999999997
so but it was really cold and it was

136.959 --> 140.72
really bright

137.84 --> 140.72
a lot of stars

141.36 --> 143.84
and the moon

145.28 --> 148.8
and it got yeah i really noticed that it

148.239 --> 151.92000000000002
it got

148.8 --> 153.92000000000002
dark so early like after five

151.92 --> 155.2
but it's also of course because yeah the

153.92 --> 157.11999999999998
clock shifted

155.2 --> 159.599
so it is actually an hour later but it's

157.12 --> 163.92000000000002
still very early like it's like what

159.599 --> 168.319
dark already that's what it kind of does

163.92 --> 171.44
but yeah beautiful day not too windy

168.319 --> 173.67999999999998
a little cold but yeah without wind

171.44 --> 175.76
on top of it it's not that cold actually

173.68 --> 180.15900000000002
so

175.76 --> 180.159
i haven't gone out for groceries yet

180.959 --> 187.36
but it will somewhere later

184.83 --> 189.519
[Music]

187.36 --> 191.36
it's thursday i did my newspaper rounds

189.519 --> 194.159
yesterday

191.36 --> 195.519
and i did it really at dusk oh wait is

194.159 --> 198.319
it dusk uh

195.519 --> 199.59900000000002
yeah dusk right don is morning dusk this

198.319 --> 202.72
evening right

199.599 --> 203.83999999999997
so i did it around that and it was kind

202.72 --> 207.35999999999999
of spectacular

203.84 --> 210.799
i realized that's that dusk

207.36 --> 214.239
sets in pretty early but it lasts

210.799 --> 215.36
much longer the transition of it fading

214.239 --> 217.76
out loud

215.36 --> 220.4
takes much more time does anybody else

217.76 --> 220.39999999999998
notice that

221.84 --> 227.84
north of the equator that is

228.4 --> 232.56
it's and it seems to me again it's like

230.72 --> 235.28
this holographic spectacle

232.56 --> 237.519
every time when these sort of things

235.28 --> 237.519
happen

239.519 --> 244.0
i don't know of course now i'm i'm

242.239 --> 247.04
thinking about that a lot more

244.0 --> 247.04
about okay

247.68 --> 254.31900000000002
how like does it work my model

252.159 --> 255.28
for the light for the celestial light

254.319 --> 257.519
does it work it

255.28 --> 259.519
i test it every day every day i look at

257.519 --> 262.88
it and every day i'm like holy [ __ ] this

259.519 --> 264.8
is so miraculous you can't believe it

262.88 --> 266.56
there's this holographic spectacle

264.8 --> 268.639
taking place

266.56 --> 270.24
if you don't think about it it just

268.639 --> 272.96000000000004
seems very beautiful

270.24 --> 273.759
but when you think about it it's like

272.96 --> 279.03999999999996
whoa

273.759 --> 282.40000000000003
dude trips me out sometimes

279.04 --> 285.04
but not in a in a scary way

282.4 --> 288.63899999999995
i really just try to see it as like a

285.04 --> 288.639
miracle created by the creator

292.8 --> 301.28000000000003
right so anyway let's see who's in chat

297.12 --> 301.28000000000003
i got green tea didn't pour it in yet

305.36 --> 313.759
nice and hot it's still a bit shitty

311.759 --> 315.12
but yeah i haven't gone out and moved

313.759 --> 317.039
around a lot so

315.12 --> 318.96
yeah i then tend to be a little bit more

317.039 --> 320.96
chilly when it's actually cold

318.96 --> 322.79999999999995
because moving around does heat me up a

320.96 --> 325.919
lot

322.8 --> 329.36
tend to get all sweaty and [ __ ] but it's

325.919 --> 330.479
good for my physiology it's really like

329.36 --> 335.52000000000004
my sports every day

330.479 --> 335.52
that's why i don't buy in a lot of [ __ ]

336.16 --> 340.88000000000005
so that i don't have to go out i know i

338.639 --> 342.08
it's basically at a mat no i'm gonna go

340.88 --> 344.88
out

342.08 --> 346.8
it's like i have to so i've basically

344.88 --> 349.12
because of my health it's my sport

346.8 --> 351.84000000000003
basically i have to keep on doing that

349.12 --> 354.4
every day and then i stabilize much

351.84 --> 356.479
better i have much more

354.4 --> 357.44
energy available to me if i just keep

356.479 --> 360.88
doing that

357.44 --> 363.68
during all times and like not let the

360.88 --> 365.44
weather in general be an objection like

363.68 --> 366.72
i don't like going through shitty

365.44 --> 369.52
weather

366.72 --> 372.8
but i ensure that i'm just gonna have to

369.52 --> 372.79999999999995
go at some point anyway

373.199 --> 377.28000000000003
and then afterward doesn't really

374.88 --> 382.4
usually it doesn't turn to

377.28 --> 382.4
turn out that bad right

382.56 --> 389.44
anyway jet samson

386.319 --> 394.8
samson samson was first

389.44 --> 397.84
and obermockel michael jones

394.8 --> 400.96000000000004
ambo anna koala

397.84 --> 400.96
jason mccarmack

401.36 --> 408.16
right so good to see you all so far

405.6 --> 409.59900000000005
for some reason nathan did a premiere

408.16 --> 414.16
like right on

409.599 --> 414.15999999999997
to to my time slot i don't know why but

414.56 --> 419.12
yeah i i don't mind too much but i did

417.599 --> 423.84
put out a link to my

419.12 --> 423.84000000000003
show that's in his chat

427.28 --> 440.55999999999995
hey michael jones

436.4 --> 440.56
all right so i did make some notes

442.0 --> 444.319
all right

446.56 --> 452.72
i think at some point i kind of forgot

449.84 --> 452.71999999999997
what was that

458.8 --> 463.759
it's weird man sometimes i get so

461.84 --> 466.63899999999995
in the flow of things because yes they

463.759 --> 468.96000000000004
had a pretty good day

466.639 --> 471.12
like compared to last week wednesday

468.96 --> 474.56
when everything kind of seemed to like

471.12 --> 476.16
go wrong and [ __ ] this wednesday

474.56 --> 479.84
i guess also because the light was just

476.16 --> 479.84000000000003
very good very focused

479.919 --> 483.28
but then when i really get in the flow

481.84 --> 485.52
of things i well

483.28 --> 488.71999999999997
forget to make notes but i get so caught

485.52 --> 491.68
up it's like i've kind of lose myself

488.72 --> 493.91900000000004
in the process that then afterward i

491.68 --> 496.479
have a lot of trouble

493.919 --> 499.039
figuring out what i actually did with

496.479 --> 499.039
certainty

503.28 --> 508.23999999999995
okay i did know yeah of course a flight

505.759 --> 510.72
of debate

508.24 --> 512.08
and owen benjamin went live again caught

510.72 --> 514.8000000000001
him

512.08 --> 514.8000000000001
completely

515.599 --> 522.0
and yes giving his perspective

519.039 --> 522.3199999999999
perspective on the election situation

522.0 --> 526.0
and

522.32 --> 526.0
how it is really like a theater

527.92 --> 534.24
i made a little joke and he read it out

531.04 --> 535.68
and i yeah made a note of it so that i

534.24 --> 537.12
wouldn't forget about it because that

535.68 --> 538.7199999999999
happens sometimes it's really funny he

537.12 --> 539.839
does that with a lot of people in chat

538.72 --> 541.9200000000001
when they

539.839 --> 543.6
make interesting comments but i made a

541.92 --> 548.0799999999999
joke

543.6 --> 551.12
so everybody of course knows biden has

548.08 --> 553.76
said a lot of silly things and he said

551.12 --> 554.9590000000001
if you vote trump you're not black it's

553.76 --> 558.08
one of the most

554.959 --> 559.5189999999999
preposterous things probably he said

558.08 --> 561.36
maybe not the weirdest but it is

559.519 --> 564.16
preposterous so

561.36 --> 565.6
and i said okay if you don't vote if you

564.16 --> 569.519
vote for trump you're not black

565.6 --> 572.9590000000001
if you vote biden you ain't white

569.519 --> 576.88
if you don't vote you won't be assigned

572.959 --> 580.64
a race

576.88 --> 580.64
yeah i don't know

581.04 --> 584.959
it could probably use some smoothening

583.04 --> 588.3199999999999
out but i thought it was a

584.959 --> 589.68
funny concept and owen benjamin agreed

588.32 --> 593.36
so yay

589.68 --> 596.64
good goody uh

593.36 --> 597.6
also yeah when did he dug into the

596.64 --> 599.76
coffee

597.6 --> 601.839
and we went a kind of conspirator on

599.76 --> 604.16
that but it was freaking hilarious i

601.839 --> 609.0400000000001
never even saw it before

604.16 --> 609.04
so coffee what could that mean

609.36 --> 619.279
could it be covet flat earth flat earth

615.2 --> 623.44
or could it be coveted false flag

619.279 --> 623.4399999999999
with silent e's like

624.079 --> 631.04
it's that really turned out very funny

627.44 --> 633.6
yeah kofi indeed

631.04 --> 636.16
so was that accident that spelling error

633.6 --> 639.519
was it like a

636.16 --> 641.279
covet false flag hint or was it about

639.519 --> 644.839
an announcement of what's going to go

641.279 --> 647.4399999999999
down covet and flatter it and more flat

644.839 --> 649.839
earth

647.44 --> 652.0790000000001
it's very interesting to look at it like

649.839 --> 654.24
from an esoteric perspective

652.079 --> 658.64
to find the intention behind it if it

654.24 --> 658.64
was there or if it was there secretly

658.839 --> 663.0400000000001
even

660.56 --> 665.279
you know you could even see it like this

663.04 --> 666.64
but yeah again full conspirator there's

665.279 --> 669.68
no real viability

666.64 --> 673.279
to any of it but

669.68 --> 674.3199999999999
say that he basically yeah i love doing

673.279 --> 676.48
this [ __ ]

674.32 --> 678.24
but don't get caught up and don't think

676.48 --> 680.48
it's actually literally real because

678.24 --> 681.519
it's just pure speculation conspiracy

680.48 --> 683.839
tardation

681.519 --> 685.6
i love that [ __ ] so what if he just

683.839 --> 689.2790000000001
typed that

685.6 --> 692.5600000000001
and then like the auto spell did it

689.279 --> 696.079
he didn't notice but it's kind of like

692.56 --> 696.079
it was anticipated

697.44 --> 700.24
and kind of like

700.72 --> 707.36
maybe they they

703.76 --> 709.6
made that auto like somebody interfacing

707.36 --> 713.12
basically with his

709.6 --> 717.44
yeah with his telephone like the

713.12 --> 718.24
his own crew secret service checking on

717.44 --> 720.5600000000001
him

718.24 --> 722.0790000000001
because i bet that he probably does have

720.56 --> 725.1999999999999
does allow a secret

722.079 --> 727.92
certain secret service guys to just full

725.2 --> 729.44
view his stuff also to see if it's not

727.92 --> 731.4399999999999
getting hacked by anybody else

729.44 --> 732.9590000000001
you know that sort of thing and maybe

731.44 --> 736.1600000000001
they kind of like

732.959 --> 739.5999999999999
did a covert mistake in there that

736.16 --> 740.079
would be a code hint to the future or

739.6 --> 743.2
something

740.079 --> 745.04
but yeah conspiracy tardation i love

743.2 --> 747.44
that [ __ ]

745.04 --> 749.519
because there is a very very vague

747.44 --> 752.8000000000001
remote possibility of it

749.519 --> 755.839
and it draws in all these relevant

752.8 --> 758.0
things and situations that are around

755.839 --> 759.519
and that's what i like about it it's

758.0 --> 761.839
almost like you make a

759.519 --> 763.6
quick story out of it putting several

761.839 --> 765.0400000000001
pieces of information together now

763.6 --> 767.6800000000001
whether it is true

765.04 --> 770.48
is actually quite unlikely but it does

767.68 --> 770.4799999999999
inform

770.839 --> 773.839
see

775.92 --> 779.1999999999999
that's always been the good part about

777.44 --> 783.2
conspiracy theories

779.2 --> 785.2
is that the ones that do that always

783.2 --> 787.0400000000001
when they're really serious about it

785.2 --> 789.0400000000001
whether they're mistaken or not always

787.04 --> 791.519
try to draw in as much information as

789.04 --> 793.1999999999999
possible

791.519 --> 795.12
and that's always been the good part not

793.2 --> 796.8000000000001
even usually their opinions it's just

795.12 --> 798.839
like oh getting confronted with all the

796.8 --> 801.8389999999999
information they dug up

798.839 --> 801.839
see

806.34 --> 811.6800000000001
[Music]

808.16 --> 811.68
yeah yeah timey wumbo

812.88 --> 816.639
yeah i i yeah you could apply occam's

815.68 --> 819.76
razor through it

816.639 --> 823.839
of course tiny wombo but it's

819.76 --> 823.8389999999999
it's nice to fantasize about it

824.16 --> 827.519
and hey look even if like our mistakes

826.72 --> 830.399
mistakes

827.519 --> 831.76
you know not from the consciousness of

830.399 --> 835.44
the person perspective

831.76 --> 838.3199999999999
but in the grandscape of things in the

835.44 --> 839.6
in the structuralized influence and

838.32 --> 841.6800000000001
design that god

839.6 --> 844.24
assigned things to like are mistakes

841.68 --> 845.92
really mistakes or are they basically

844.24 --> 848.24
where the consciousness kind of is

845.92 --> 851.36
forced to surrender to

848.24 --> 853.839
yeah to a divine entity

851.36 --> 856.399
that then proceeds to make the mistake

853.839 --> 861.36
for the individual

856.399 --> 861.36
ah now but that's philosophical

868.839 --> 871.839
right

879.12 --> 883.36
then again if the individual has a

881.199 --> 886.7199999999999
record in their mind of how

883.36 --> 888.399
the mistake was established yeah then it

886.72 --> 891.44
can be

888.399 --> 893.199
more assigned to um yeah

891.44 --> 898.48
a regular mistake but the funny thing is

893.199 --> 901.68
also that he just kind of left it there

898.48 --> 903.1990000000001
maybe he just did it and then saw it was

901.68 --> 905.12
kind of funny and thought well

903.199 --> 907.199
you know what if i retract it people are

905.12 --> 909.199
probably going to

907.199 --> 912.639
go more nuts over he didn't retract it

909.199 --> 916.16
right the coffee

912.639 --> 916.16
no anyway it's

916.48 --> 931.04
conspiracy theorizing about a tweet

927.839 --> 931.0400000000001
so what are you talking about

935.04 --> 941.8389999999999
the president oh god president

952.839 --> 959.6800000000001
okey-dokey

955.36 --> 959.6800000000001
yeah i'm okay if

960.0 --> 963.44
president biden joins the chat as long

962.88 --> 968.16
as he

963.44 --> 970.399
stays uh keeps his hands off my uh

968.16 --> 972.639
my younger chat visitors thank you very

970.399 --> 972.639
much

976.32 --> 997.839
because yeah it's 12 and up technically

982.72 --> 997.839
so you're warned mister

1008.839 --> 1011.839
hmm

1017.12 --> 1022.24
michael jordan owen started talking

1020.399 --> 1024.72
you're right michael jones so owen

1022.24 --> 1028.319
benjamin kind of woke you up to that

1024.72 --> 1029.039
yeah i think well the funny thing is a

1028.319 --> 1033.839
lot of people

1029.039 --> 1033.839
did it it's just that owen benjamin

1034.88 --> 1042.24
he did it very carefully like his

1039.039 --> 1044.799
power it's kind of like his

1042.24 --> 1046.88
careful compartmentalization power to

1044.799 --> 1048.0
deal with situation in compartmentalized

1046.88 --> 1050.3200000000002
fashion

1048.0 --> 1052.64
because he is very intelligent is not

1050.32 --> 1055.36
bluffing like that just

1052.64 --> 1056.5590000000002
i can feel it about it i have similar

1055.36 --> 1060.1599999999999
traits in my own way

1056.559 --> 1062.16
it's just a different way of applying it

1060.16 --> 1063.76
gave it all that power more to one

1062.16 --> 1067.1200000000001
faction of myself

1063.76 --> 1069.2
right uh but

1067.12 --> 1070.3999999999999
he literally i think that it was an

1069.2 --> 1073.52
honest awakening

1070.4 --> 1075.039
slowly in the process he tried to deal

1073.52 --> 1079.52
with and then

1075.039 --> 1082.799
carefully through comedy tried to

1079.52 --> 1085.28
allow people to let themselves be pulled

1082.799 --> 1089.84
into that

1085.28 --> 1092.559
and basically help them out with comedy

1089.84 --> 1094.559
and yeah to kind of stave off the

1092.559 --> 1096.8799999999999
typical outrage and angst that does

1094.559 --> 1098.24
come with it also of course he dealt a

1096.88 --> 1099.44
lot with the trolls which is an

1098.24 --> 1100.88
important factor

1099.44 --> 1102.799
that always tends to happen when

1100.88 --> 1104.16
somebody really starts to figure out

1102.799 --> 1107.44
flat earth and starts to

1104.16 --> 1110.96
want to speak out about it and

1107.44 --> 1116.0
yeah he just did the flat

1110.96 --> 1116.0
breaking flat earth to you in a very

1116.16 --> 1122.88
appealing way and or an engaging

1119.52 --> 1124.4
way and that worked that probably worked

1122.88 --> 1126.3200000000002
for a lot of people i've i

1124.4 --> 1128.5590000000002
sat through that and was like yeah man

1126.32 --> 1130.96
this is good stuff this is like

1128.559 --> 1131.76
he's doing it really well i liked it a

1130.96 --> 1134.4
lot

1131.76 --> 1136.08
it it pulled me i yeah i really became a

1134.4 --> 1140.0800000000002
fan of him as soon as i noticed

1136.08 --> 1142.8799999999999
that and that he

1140.08 --> 1144.72
he didn't just do it to prove that he

1142.88 --> 1148.88
could and then never address it again no

1144.72 --> 1148.88
no he constantly readdresses it too

1149.2 --> 1154.559
and all the good skits that he made

1152.4 --> 1155.52
the moon landing and boomers and all

1154.559 --> 1157.28
that it's all

1155.52 --> 1158.8799999999999
it's awesome everything is awesome about

1157.28 --> 1165.84
it so yeah

1158.88 --> 1165.8400000000001
i totally get that

1169.36 --> 1174.6399999999999
go and play the taboo conspiracy video

1176.84 --> 1179.84
yeah

1181.44 --> 1187.52
right yeah well

1184.88 --> 1188.5590000000002
you know figuring out optics and seeing

1187.52 --> 1191.6
things

1188.559 --> 1196.16
that really does it because

1191.6 --> 1198.0
the whole presuppositional situation of

1196.16 --> 1202.159
the earth being a globe all over kind of

1198.0 --> 1204.96
starts at the horizon and even like the

1202.159 --> 1207.7600000000002
what's it the nasa peace that we treated

1204.96 --> 1212.48
at the flat earth debates

1207.76 --> 1214.8799999999999
described that there was an article

1212.48 --> 1216.559
i don't know chocolate dug it up it's

1214.88 --> 1217.7600000000002
like not even a week ago or two weeks

1216.559 --> 1220.8799999999999
ago somewhere

1217.76 --> 1222.64
but yeah well time might be flying a

1220.88 --> 1224.4
little bit more than i realized but

1222.64 --> 1226.0
somewhere in the last month that was

1224.4 --> 1227.8400000000001
brought up it's been replayed several

1226.0 --> 1231.679
times

1227.84 --> 1231.6789999999999
where it is said that yeah

1232.88 --> 1238.64
like the the

1236.32 --> 1240.3999999999999
the scientists as they say it are

1238.64 --> 1244.159
encouraged to kind of like

1240.4 --> 1247.6000000000001
make the flat earthers trust them again

1244.159 --> 1250.4
that was kind of the the exit strategy

1247.6 --> 1252.1589999999999
because it all the whole thing that it

1250.4 --> 1254.88
even suggested is that it all

1252.159 --> 1257.44
rested on the horizon being the edge of

1254.88 --> 1257.44
the sphere

1257.76 --> 1262.24
and then from there on it's built up and

1260.159 --> 1265.2800000000002
that's kind of true it's

1262.24 --> 1268.799
it's really true it's it's

1265.28 --> 1271.6789999999999
what i've been saying in my own way like

1268.799 --> 1274.08
although to me it also starts with the

1271.679 --> 1274.88
yeah the celestial rotations because

1274.08 --> 1280.8799999999999
that thing

1274.88 --> 1285.0390000000002
is just it's really the rotating thing

1280.88 --> 1285.0390000000002
it is rotating whatever it is

1285.44 --> 1291.8400000000001
and and it is it is apparently spherical

1288.32 --> 1291.84
or a demisphere

1292.0 --> 1296.559
it's visibly a demisphere but it yeah if

1295.039 --> 1299.84
you let the rotation in

1296.559 --> 1302.84
the visual aspects of the apparent

1299.84 --> 1304.48
demisphere then it is a complete sphere

1302.84 --> 1306.72
eventually

1304.48 --> 1306.72
right

1310.88 --> 1314.0
but yeah that piece

1314.96 --> 1318.0
it just tells you it's all about

1316.799 --> 1321.2
reifying the horizon

1318.0 --> 1323.12
into a sphere edge and if you learn

1321.2 --> 1326.32
about optics then you start to

1323.12 --> 1328.6399999999999
notice that the arguments continued from

1326.32 --> 1331.36
that point on to explain visuals for the

1328.64 --> 1335.2
heliocentric glow model

1331.36 --> 1338.8799999999999
they use false they use machinations

1335.2 --> 1338.88
they use terrestrial refraction

1339.919 --> 1346.96
and yeah all kinds of

1343.28 --> 1349.6
just trying to find excuses to justify

1346.96 --> 1351.3600000000001
things that should not be possible if we

1349.6 --> 1353.1999999999998
were actually looking at the edge of

1351.36 --> 1355.4399999999998
sphere

1353.2 --> 1361.8400000000001
and we can't we yeah it's called the

1355.44 --> 1361.8400000000001
black swan argument

1363.12 --> 1367.039
yeah spheres do have an edge optically

1365.76 --> 1369.52
they do

1367.039 --> 1371.76
when you look at a sphere you look at an

1369.52 --> 1371.76
edge

1372.64 --> 1379.76
an edge of that sphere yeah you do

1376.799 --> 1381.679
so yeah in geometry spheres may not have

1379.76 --> 1384.64
edges or whatever could be

1381.679 --> 1385.52
argued right but we're talking about

1384.64 --> 1389.6000000000001
looking

1385.52 --> 1393.36
at it then it does definitely have an

1389.6 --> 1397.12
edge you're looking at the edge of it

1393.36 --> 1397.12
the border visually

1400.08 --> 1407.28
so spheres do have edges optically

1403.84 --> 1410.559
and that is the thing that is addressed

1407.28 --> 1410.559
by the black swan argument

1412.559 --> 1431.84
or rather it's it's dispelled

1416.799 --> 1431.84
the assertion

1442.559 --> 1446.48
is there anywhere to catch his show

1445.6 --> 1449.76
afterward the

1446.48 --> 1452.88
life doesn't work on my cell phone

1449.76 --> 1456.8799999999999
wahana koala there

1452.88 --> 1457.44
uh it's tough he's kind of funneled all

1456.88 --> 1460.48
of it

1457.44 --> 1463.679
into uh unauthorized

1460.48 --> 1465.3600000000001
tv so yeah that's the thing

1463.679 --> 1467.6000000000001
it's pay you have to pay for it it's a

1465.36 --> 1470.8799999999999
monthly it's not that much

1467.6 --> 1471.52
i think and then yeah you can just watch

1470.88 --> 1475.44
his shows

1471.52 --> 1476.0
at any time he he got it he's got it all

1475.44 --> 1478.88
stored

1476.0 --> 1478.88
at that website

1481.919 --> 1487.8400000000001
but it's it's you have to be a member to

1485.52 --> 1487.84
view it

1497.84 --> 1501.36
so yeah you got to be lucky enough to

1499.36 --> 1501.76
just catch it live and otherwise yeah

1501.36 --> 1504.08
it's

1501.76 --> 1504.799
you got to be a member of it of that

1504.08 --> 1508.0
website

1504.799 --> 1509.76
and hey i see

1508.0 --> 1512.64
like from everything i've seen and heard

1509.76 --> 1515.36
it's pretty awesome

1512.64 --> 1518.0
they have all the the cartoon guys on

1515.36 --> 1520.7199999999998
there too and everything

1518.0 --> 1521.6
i think so i don't know how big it's

1520.72 --> 1523.3600000000001
become

1521.6 --> 1525.4399999999998
because i haven't had a really an

1523.36 --> 1526.24
insider look only kind of like what owen

1525.44 --> 1529.3600000000001
says of it

1526.24 --> 1532.64
when i catch him live

1529.36 --> 1532.6399999999999
hey my name is

1541.6 --> 1547.52
hey julio pammon good to see you

1544.88 --> 1547.5200000000002
good morning

1553.52 --> 1561.12
all right uh yeah there was

1558.24 --> 1561.679
to get a skype notification from nathan

1561.12 --> 1563.76
that

1561.679 --> 1566.0
he might be a little late i don't know

1563.76 --> 1568.1589999999999
exactly what was it

1566.0 --> 1570.24
but yeah the live show might be delayed

1568.159 --> 1573.919
a little as he said it

1570.24 --> 1574.32
we'll see i might just be continuing the

1573.919 --> 1584.0
show

1574.32 --> 1587.6
even after 3 p.m amsterdam time

1584.0 --> 1587.6
but i don't know we'll see

1591.6 --> 1596.3999999999999
oh god hannah koala yeah i kind of heard

1593.84 --> 1596.3999999999999
about that

1596.84 --> 1613.84
ridiculous

1598.559 --> 1613.84
4g on the moon god

1624.84 --> 1631.6
oh paypal

1626.96 --> 1631.6000000000001
is working is it chili of heaven

1632.32 --> 1636.24
i'll check it out i haven't had any

1635.6 --> 1641.84
troubles

1636.24 --> 1641.84
with it so far

1646.799 --> 1651.12
whoa dude

1652.08 --> 1658.1589999999999
thank you julio pappan oh

1655.12 --> 1660.08
and i also got in patreon money by the

1658.159 --> 1664.48
way

1660.08 --> 1666.96
33 55 us dollars

1664.48 --> 1668.0
so i also have to thank the patreons

1666.96 --> 1670.32
including the new

1668.0 --> 1670.32
ones

1671.039 --> 1676.72
and yeah julio pabin this is a

1674.08 --> 1678.08
very sizable donation thank you very

1676.72 --> 1683.84
much

1678.08 --> 1683.84
it's gonna help out a lot

1688.24 --> 1697.279
ah nice it's a real big relief

1693.6 --> 1698.399
you guys are awesome and yeah julio of

1697.279 --> 1701.12
heaven is a

1698.399 --> 1701.12
is a boss

1709.36 --> 1711.84
ah

1714.48 --> 1722.96
it's yeah

1719.679 --> 1725.6000000000001
i really love this setup

1722.96 --> 1726.72
like i love doing this i love the way it

1725.6 --> 1730.0
works

1726.72 --> 1731.84
it's so direct it's so honest and

1730.0 --> 1733.2
you know originally it kind of seemed

1731.84 --> 1736.799
like

1733.2 --> 1738.799
like begging but i'm just it's more like

1736.799 --> 1740.24
try like i tried early it's like being a

1738.799 --> 1744.0
street artist so it's

1740.24 --> 1747.52
just an honest service it's like people

1744.0 --> 1751.2
like it think it's good

1747.52 --> 1753.6
then yeah like

1751.2 --> 1754.48
ensure that i can keep going in a way i

1753.6 --> 1757.36
do feel like i

1754.48 --> 1757.3600000000001
almost like i'm a

1757.6 --> 1761.1999999999998
but it would be degrading to kind of use

1759.76 --> 1762.08
a metaphor like that but almost like a

1761.2 --> 1763.76
robot

1762.08 --> 1765.36
with a coin slot and you just put the

1763.76 --> 1768.48
coins in and then i do

1765.36 --> 1770.399
the thing but that's really degrading

1768.48 --> 1772.559
when i describe it like that so i don't

1770.399 --> 1776.2399999999998
think of it like that

1772.559 --> 1778.1589999999999
but yeah you guys really come through

1776.24 --> 1780.3990000000001
for me

1778.159 --> 1782.5590000000002
and i hope that you feel that i come

1780.399 --> 1785.6
through for you as well

1782.559 --> 1785.6
i really try to

1790.01 --> 1795.84
[Music]

1792.84 --> 1795.84
thanks

1796.32 --> 1801.6
three g's went on the apollo mission did

1799.44 --> 1801.6000000000001
it

1807.36 --> 1813.9799999999998
i do well thank you samson i appreciate

1810.85 --> 1813.98
[Music]

1820.84 --> 1825.279
that

1822.96 --> 1825.279
um

1826.64 --> 1829.1200000000001
all right

1830.08 --> 1834.6399999999999
still trying to remember what i was

1831.6 --> 1834.6399999999999
doing in like the last

1834.799 --> 1838.72
i think i was just watching more silly

1836.64 --> 1840.48
videos and playing a game and why they

1838.72 --> 1843.679
had a really good dinner again i did the

1840.48 --> 1843.679
chicken broccoli thing

1844.159 --> 1847.7600000000002
and it's just awesome especially when

1846.159 --> 1851.8400000000001
it's getting a little bit

1847.76 --> 1851.84
more chilly out there

1854.799 --> 1858.48
and it's really great on the on the

1856.799 --> 1860.32
digestion

1858.48 --> 1862.24
that's what i noticed compared to some

1860.32 --> 1865.36
other types of food

1862.24 --> 1869.1200000000001
it's just working really well for me so

1865.36 --> 1871.84
chicken broccoli i love that [ __ ]

1869.12 --> 1871.84
baby butter

1872.72 --> 1879.84
but i'm not eating that every day that

1881.36 --> 1885.9189999999999
ah right but that's not super

1883.36 --> 1885.9189999999999
interesting

1889.84 --> 1894.08
right well maybe i can just bring back a

1891.76 --> 1897.6
little bit of yesterday

1894.08 --> 1897.6
because yeah i called my show

1899.12 --> 1903.12
yesterday i called it guesses are not

1901.12 --> 1907.1999999999998
susceptible to

1903.12 --> 1910.08
momentum and

1907.2 --> 1911.8400000000001
yeah there's been some reactions to this

1910.08 --> 1915.36
and it's kind of like

1911.84 --> 1916.1589999999999
not exactly what i expected that's the

1915.36 --> 1918.4799999999998
weird thing

1916.159 --> 1920.3200000000002
something weird happened i'll tell you

1918.48 --> 1923.1200000000001
about it you can

1920.32 --> 1924.72
drag this out very low no but it's it's

1923.12 --> 1928.4799999999998
an interesting concept

1924.72 --> 1930.159
what happened because when i said that

1928.48 --> 1931.76
when i described that and i did so

1930.159 --> 1934.96
eloquently i did so also in the flat

1931.76 --> 1938.799
earth debate

1934.96 --> 1942.64
i just thought like yeah of course

1938.799 --> 1944.1589999999999
this is established right susceptibility

1942.64 --> 1946.7990000000002
to momentum

1944.159 --> 1948.0
that's a thing right right it's totally

1946.799 --> 1951.039
logical right

1948.0 --> 1954.64
well guess what uh yeah

1951.039 --> 1955.12
it seems like it's not an established

1954.64 --> 1957.3600000000001
thing

1955.12 --> 1960.32
and it's kind of confusing like because

1957.36 --> 1962.0
i assumed that that would just be

1960.32 --> 1965.36
written down somewhere it would be

1962.0 --> 1965.36
official but apparently

1966.24 --> 1971.36
yeah nobody's basically shoved an

1968.24 --> 1973.76
official thing about it in my face

1971.36 --> 1973.76
and

1974.48 --> 1978.08
so it's something that kind of hasn't

1976.32 --> 1982.399
really been addressed is this

1978.08 --> 1986.48
is this new ground did i just discover

1982.399 --> 1988.7199999999998
something basically maybe even like

1986.48 --> 1990.559
something that could be added to natural

1988.72 --> 1992.159
law well nathan says it's part of the

1990.559 --> 1996.799
first law

1992.159 --> 1996.7990000000002
of thermodynamics but i'm not sure

1999.84 --> 2003.76
but yeah i didn't get the responses that

2001.679 --> 2005.44
i thought i would get i got a bunch of

2003.76 --> 2007.519
trolls that would just say oh really

2005.44 --> 2009.919
stupid

2007.519 --> 2012.08
that doesn't really matter and i got

2009.919 --> 2013.919
responses from well flat earthers that i

2012.08 --> 2015.6
thought first were ballers and that were

2013.919 --> 2017.44
telling me like that doesn't match at

2015.6 --> 2020.0
all with momentum

2017.44 --> 2022.24
like what what do you mean can you

2020.0 --> 2024.559
please explain how i was wrong then

2022.24 --> 2026.559
how did i get momentum incorrect but it

2024.559 --> 2029.8999999999999
never really got an in-depth

2026.559 --> 2031.2
technical reply to that

2029.9 --> 2035.1200000000001
[Music]

2031.2 --> 2038.3990000000001
so yeah i'm a little confused because

2035.12 --> 2041.1999999999998
what i i guess discovered

2038.399 --> 2042.7199999999998
rediscovered because the new no new

2041.2 --> 2044.0
discoveries only rediscoveries

2042.72 --> 2045.919
everything's been discovered at some

2044.0 --> 2048.079
point and everything's been forgotten at

2045.919 --> 2051.599
some point

2048.079 --> 2053.9190000000003
so yeah susceptibility

2051.599 --> 2055.599
to momentum is not officially a thing i

2053.919 --> 2059.5989999999997
guess

2055.599 --> 2061.839
but it's definitely

2059.599 --> 2061.839
there

2064.0 --> 2070.879
could you call it a phenomenon

2067.44 --> 2070.879
like what can i do with this

2070.96 --> 2074.639
maybe this might turn out to actually be

2073.359 --> 2077.2
paper worthy

2074.639 --> 2079.359
or something but then yeah you got an

2077.2 --> 2081.04
issue because i'm not really an academic

2079.359 --> 2083.679
paper writer

2081.04 --> 2084.8
never done that ever i need assistance

2083.679 --> 2086.96
with that [ __ ]

2084.8 --> 2088.7200000000003
because i'd probably get a headache just

2086.96 --> 2090.7200000000003
trying to figure it out i got even a

2088.72 --> 2093.2799999999997
headache trying to figure out just

2090.72 --> 2094.6389999999997
writing solicitation letters for jobs

2093.28 --> 2096.32
and [ __ ]

2094.639 --> 2097.6800000000003
thought i always thought that was very

2096.32 --> 2099.52
strenuous

2097.68 --> 2101.2799999999997
and i feel this is kind of on the same

2099.52 --> 2103.119
level because you have to abide by all

2101.28 --> 2104.8
these things that i have no oversight

2103.119 --> 2107.599
over i don't like to deal with that

2104.8 --> 2110.7200000000003
that's kind of been the luxury of having

2107.599 --> 2113.2000000000003
to step away from

2110.72 --> 2115.359
those systems and being completely

2113.2 --> 2116.16
independent most of my life just trying

2115.359 --> 2120.64
to assimilate

2116.16 --> 2123.68
information as i could utilize it right

2120.64 --> 2125.92
but yeah maybe this is a paper worthy

2123.68 --> 2129.1189999999997
discovery

2125.92 --> 2129.839
but if it is maybe somebody out there

2129.119 --> 2133.359
would

2129.839 --> 2136.24
genuinely try to assist me

2133.359 --> 2137.68
in getting it as such maybe have some

2136.24 --> 2141.04
connections

2137.68 --> 2141.04
i don't know how that works

2141.599 --> 2145.599
because i'm not shy to manifest such

2145.2 --> 2149.68
things

2145.599 --> 2152.32
i'm just not really capable of doing

2149.68 --> 2155.5989999999997
that all on my own at this point

2152.32 --> 2158.56
although i might be taught about it but

2155.599 --> 2160.0
again that always kind of only works

2158.56 --> 2161.7599999999998
one-on-one

2160.0 --> 2165.52
that's the way i learn best and i

2161.76 --> 2168.32
directly is assimilate the others

2165.52 --> 2173.7599999999998
intuitive knowledge including that it

2168.32 --> 2176.8
works really well with me

2173.76 --> 2179.6800000000003
but yeah i've never had that

2176.8 --> 2181.3590000000004
so far never really dealt with that that

2179.68 --> 2184.0
i can remember maybe my brother

2181.359 --> 2186.24
tried to help me out a little but just

2184.0 --> 2187.52
got completely impatient because it gave

2186.24 --> 2192.7999999999997
me a headache and i was like

2187.52 --> 2192.8
i don't want to do this very annoying

2196.24 --> 2202.3199999999997
i just don't like the the bureaucracy

2200.0 --> 2202.32
it all

2203.839 --> 2209.839
but anyway it's still yeah i'm much

2206.88 --> 2212.079
older now i'm not that guy i used to be

2209.839 --> 2213.2
and with some assistance i might be able

2212.079 --> 2215.44
to actually

2213.2 --> 2217.9199999999996
manifest this concept if anybody's

2215.44 --> 2217.92
interested

2220.4 --> 2224.1600000000003
in a way i'd like i would be interested

2222.8 --> 2227.28
to hear

2224.16 --> 2231.7599999999998
bob nodell's opinion about

2227.28 --> 2236.2400000000002
it because i know he has the skills

2231.76 --> 2237.92
and yeah i you know

2236.24 --> 2239.7599999999998
i'm kind of curious what he has to say

2237.92 --> 2242.0
about it and then of course there's also

2239.76 --> 2246.5600000000004
adam meekin i think adamican did address

2242.0 --> 2249.599
it but not in depth

2246.56 --> 2251.92
maybe he could also help if he want to

2249.599 --> 2252.8
you know the guy is always doing way too

2251.92 --> 2256.96
much

2252.8 --> 2260.6400000000003
for everybody so i'm not to demand it

2256.96 --> 2260.64
but maybe he could i don't know

2266.32 --> 2270.0
oh by the way thank you good servant for

2268.56 --> 2273.2799999999997
the 99 cent super chat

2270.0 --> 2273.28
donation i appreciate it

2282.839 --> 2288.16
right

2284.64 --> 2291.2
so yeah susceptibility to momentum gases

2288.16 --> 2295.839
are not in gases will never

2291.2 --> 2299.2799999999997
in any rotationary situation

2295.839 --> 2302.48
like liquids

2299.28 --> 2306.0
then in that sense by the way gas

2302.48 --> 2308.96
in liquid pressurized form would

2306.0 --> 2311.2
be susceptible to momentum but only

2308.96 --> 2314.8
because they are then in liquid form

2311.2 --> 2316.24
and then they will yeah it will happen

2314.8 --> 2318.88
to it

2316.24 --> 2321.04
but in the gaseous state it's not

2318.88 --> 2322.0
susceptible to momentum so it will never

2321.04 --> 2325.52
be able to

2322.0 --> 2328.96
completely perfectly move in lockstep

2325.52 --> 2333.2
with yeah with a

2328.96 --> 2336.96
in a rotating setup and that's basically

2333.2 --> 2340.8799999999997
what i suggested and described how

2336.96 --> 2344.56
because the gas is only responding to

2340.88 --> 2346.56
pressure changes to pressure dynamics

2344.56 --> 2348.16
so if there's slight pressure change

2346.56 --> 2350.0789999999997
then it might shift it might move

2348.16 --> 2353.2799999999997
towards the lower pressure

2350.079 --> 2356.88
or be pushed away by the higher pressure

2353.28 --> 2359.2000000000003
that is kind of what happens so objects

2356.88 --> 2364.0
in a rotationary situation will cause

2359.2 --> 2366.48
drag on the gases

2364.0 --> 2368.16
but that drag is only because the local

2366.48 --> 2371.04
pressure differential everything moves

2368.16 --> 2374.24
around it eventually

2371.04 --> 2376.88
it will never stir it like with liquids

2374.24 --> 2377.52
enough that it will eventually cause the

2376.88 --> 2381.359
gas to

2377.52 --> 2386.64
all move with it no it will never reach

2381.359 --> 2386.64
full lock step rotationary

2387.04 --> 2389.68
completion

2394.64 --> 2399.7599999999998
see and that is all about yeah that's

2398.079 --> 2402.7200000000003
what the

2399.76 --> 2404.6400000000003
susceptibility of momentum how i called

2402.72 --> 2406.72
it well that's what that is about

2404.64 --> 2407.839
and gases are not susceptible to

2406.72 --> 2411.5989999999997
momentum

2407.839 --> 2414.7999999999997
so they will never be able to reach

2411.599 --> 2418.4
completion with yeah

2414.8 --> 2421.8390000000004
in a lock step set yeah lock step way

2418.4 --> 2421.839
in a rotationary setup

2422.839 --> 2425.839
right

2426.079 --> 2431.92
and i bet that people could test this

2429.44 --> 2432.56
to see if it's correct or not because

2431.92 --> 2436.48
hey i

2432.56 --> 2439.359
might be wrong you know i might be wrong

2436.48 --> 2441.52
so hey it shouldn't be too difficult to

2439.359 --> 2445.68
try and disprove it

2441.52 --> 2448.8
get your own centrifuge setup a ring

2445.68 --> 2452.24
with some materials in it maybe

2448.8 --> 2454.1600000000003
like you could put a an object in there

2452.24 --> 2456.24
that sticks out the solid

2454.16 --> 2458.24
to cause that drag effect there's all

2456.24 --> 2460.56
kinds of things that you can definitely

2458.24 --> 2462.319
easily test here on earth

2460.56 --> 2466.56
you don't need anything dangerous or

2462.319 --> 2468.56
complicated like a pressure chamber

2466.56 --> 2472.0
just need a ring and kind of like a

2468.56 --> 2472.0
motor to make it rotate

2472.079 --> 2475.2000000000003
and yeah if you're going to make it

2473.28 --> 2477.119
rotate extremely fast

2475.2 --> 2479.1189999999997
then yeah you might you will have to

2477.119 --> 2480.319
secure the setup so that it can't just

2479.119 --> 2483.839
go out of whack and just

2480.319 --> 2483.839
break through the wall and [ __ ]

2484.0 --> 2489.68
but other than that it's not dangerous

2487.359 --> 2492.16
at all anybody could basically do it

2489.68 --> 2495.839
i don't see even it requiring that

2492.16 --> 2495.839
higher budget to do

2503.119 --> 2509.359
yes tiny womble now well no

2506.8 --> 2510.48
there will be drag see there will be

2509.359 --> 2514.319
drag the object

2510.48 --> 2516.56
will cause the gas to compress

2514.319 --> 2517.52
causing it to have higher pressure then

2516.56 --> 2521.119
it will press

2517.52 --> 2522.16
forward in front of the object this is

2521.119 --> 2525.2000000000003
turbulence

2522.16 --> 2527.44
we should use a stick or something

2525.2 --> 2527.4399999999996
uh

2532.0 --> 2540.8
a good object

2537.52 --> 2544.64
yeah maybe a bottle or something right

2540.8 --> 2547.76
so the bottle as it moves in the setup

2544.64 --> 2551.04
it's gonna move this way it's gonna move

2547.76 --> 2551.44
it will cause pressure right in front of

2551.04 --> 2553.7599999999998
it

2551.44 --> 2555.359
in the gases that are compressed against

2553.76 --> 2559.28
it that will cause

2555.359 --> 2560.72
a little push and in all directions

2559.28 --> 2562.1600000000003
pressure will go in in the lower

2560.72 --> 2564.16
pressure zone in all directions and

2562.16 --> 2565.7599999999998
cause it to move and that's cause

2564.16 --> 2567.52
called but eventually it will slip

2565.76 --> 2569.3590000000004
around it because behind is slightly

2567.52 --> 2573.68
lower pressure

2569.359 --> 2580.319
and that's called drag in aerodynamics

2573.68 --> 2582.64
but here's the thing unless

2580.319 --> 2583.599
there's like unless there's an object

2582.64 --> 2587.1189999999997
that is literally

2583.599 --> 2587.76
closing off the cycle disabling the gas

2587.119 --> 2591.28
to move

2587.76 --> 2593.6800000000003
past it in the rotary rotationary setup

2591.28 --> 2595.28
is it closed off yes then all the gas

2593.68 --> 2598.56
will move in lock step because

2595.28 --> 2601.28
there is no escape past

2598.56 --> 2603.119
the obstacle within the rotary setup and

2601.28 --> 2604.8
so it's basically a closed container

2603.119 --> 2605.6800000000003
it's going to be pushed all the way with

2604.8 --> 2608.6400000000003
it

2605.68 --> 2609.9199999999996
right or constantly and eventually in

2608.64 --> 2612.0789999999997
front of it there will be

2609.92 --> 2613.6800000000003
there will be a gradient i'll predict

2612.079 --> 2614.96
this there will be if you do that closed

2613.68 --> 2618.0
off setup

2614.96 --> 2620.319
in in a ring there will be a gradient

2618.0 --> 2622.88
where there will be higher pressure in

2620.319 --> 2626.48
where it's pushing and a lower pressure

2622.88 --> 2629.359
behind it as long as it keeps rotating

2626.48 --> 2629.68
but if you don't if it's if the gas can

2629.359 --> 2633.359
move

2629.68 --> 2636.56
past it right in the thing

2633.359 --> 2638.96
then it will only cause drag and the gas

2636.56 --> 2639.599
will never be able to move in full lock

2638.96 --> 2642.4
step

2639.599 --> 2642.4
with the setup

2644.079 --> 2649.8390000000004
hope that clears up the situation

2659.839 --> 2663.839
yeah it's a bottle of water

2665.9 --> 2668.9990000000003
[Music]

2672.72 --> 2678.24
hey look who's

2676.0 --> 2678.24
that

2679.92 --> 2684.96
just goes to show that he's not banned

2682.72 --> 2684.9599999999996
but

2688.0 --> 2691.839
word salad so

2692.24 --> 2699.4399999999996
that's hey adam

2695.76 --> 2699.6800000000003
good point oh god look did you just get

2699.44 --> 2703.359
in

2699.68 --> 2705.359
adam because i basically just explained

2703.359 --> 2706.56
the main concept of yesterday's hangout

2705.359 --> 2710.7999999999997
in the full detail

2706.56 --> 2712.88
a rotatory setup and how gas would be

2710.8 --> 2716.319
dragged

2712.88 --> 2717.839
and if it would be closed off so there

2716.319 --> 2718.8
would not be drag there would be a

2717.839 --> 2721.52
constant

2718.8 --> 2722.88
full contact yeah circular container

2721.52 --> 2724.8
that would just cause a pressure

2722.88 --> 2727.44
differential maybe

2724.8 --> 2729.28
a gradient within it and otherwise it's

2727.44 --> 2730.079
just dragon if as long as there's no

2729.28 --> 2731.8390000000004
close off

2730.079 --> 2733.6800000000003
and the gas can move past it in the

2731.839 --> 2736.7999999999997
rotatory setup

2733.68 --> 2736.7999999999997
it will never reach

2737.119 --> 2744.0
a completion

2740.4 --> 2745.76
in a lock step rotate yeah rotation with

2744.0 --> 2748.24
the rest of the materials and the

2745.76 --> 2749.0400000000004
and the rotating object the rotating

2748.24 --> 2751.7599999999998
tube

2749.04 --> 2753.52
i explained that and simon dan says it's

2751.76 --> 2755.44
word salad

2753.52 --> 2757.28
because he probably just didn't

2755.44 --> 2759.76
understand what i was talking about and

2757.28 --> 2761.8390000000004
to me that's very funny

2759.76 --> 2763.76
that he would actually leave a comment

2761.839 --> 2765.7599999999998
in my chat like that not that i really

2763.76 --> 2769.0400000000004
care because he's an absolute

2765.76 --> 2769.0400000000004
intellectual nobody

2769.28 --> 2773.0400000000004
who does have a lot of it's a big

2772.079 --> 2775.8390000000004
channel

2773.04 --> 2775.839
so important

2777.28 --> 2788.079
but it's funny that he's in here

2780.4 --> 2791.76
it's been a while

2788.079 --> 2795.04
kent what kent hovind do you mean

2791.76 --> 2797.28
really went after ken hovind oh my god

2795.04 --> 2797.2799999999997
why

2800.839 --> 2803.839
okay

2810.96 --> 2814.64
somebody's really triggered here

2815.839 --> 2820.7999999999997
holy [ __ ] was that one of your fans

2825.839 --> 2831.599
yeah you don't even understand the claim

2829.2 --> 2833.359
you don't you literally don't know the

2831.599 --> 2835.44
the meaning of the words you're using

2833.359 --> 2839.04
you don't understand the context

2835.44 --> 2841.119
you don't know the implications you are

2839.04 --> 2842.88
an intellectual nobody that's the thing

2841.119 --> 2844.319
you got correct in what you just said

2842.88 --> 2846.4
there

2844.319 --> 2848.4
you are one of the most intellectually

2846.4 --> 2852.1600000000003
incompetent people i've ever

2848.4 --> 2852.559
faced on the internet that does make you

2852.16 --> 2855.1189999999997
a

2852.559 --> 2858.4
bad person because of that but it is

2855.119 --> 2873.04
kind of been astounding

2858.4 --> 2875.44
just so you know simon then

2873.04 --> 2877.7599999999998
well you know them by their fruit simon

2875.44 --> 2877.76
then

2877.92 --> 2881.76
my works has definitely contributed to

2881.359 --> 2884.88
the

2881.76 --> 2886.3190000000004
general vernacular of the high tier flat

2884.88 --> 2890.48
earth scene

2886.319 --> 2893.04
so i'll leave the intellectual

2890.48 --> 2895.599
somebody or nobody to the people's

2893.04 --> 2895.599
judgment

2895.76 --> 2898.3190000000004
out there

2899.44 --> 2906.559
but yeah you've made elaborate

2903.559 --> 2906.559
demonstrations

2907.52 --> 2913.119
that eventually led to this opinion i

2910.48 --> 2913.119
have of you

2913.2 --> 2918.24
and i'm trying to be sort of nice which

2916.24 --> 2920.8799999999997
you in reality don't really

2918.24 --> 2920.8799999999997
deserve

2921.92 --> 2927.119
because as nathan says it you're just

2924.079 --> 2927.119
incredibly thick

2927.599 --> 2931.04
and when people are incredibly thick you

2930.079 --> 2933.04
have to get

2931.04 --> 2934.24
loud and sometimes even almost

2933.04 --> 2937.44
aggressive

2934.24 --> 2937.4399999999996
to get through to them

2939.2 --> 2957.839
i'm not really interested in trying to

2941.68 --> 2957.839
get through to you

2960.8 --> 2964.8
yeah that's it's lovely isn't it keep on

2964.079 --> 2967.119
cackling

2964.8 --> 2968.7200000000003
i i it's lovely that you find it so

2967.119 --> 2970.8
amusing

2968.72 --> 2972.64
you know i would laugh it up too if i

2970.8 --> 2974.48
literally did not understand what the

2972.64 --> 2977.68
hell i was dealing with

2974.48 --> 2978.48
but i felt brave enough to kind of make

2977.68 --> 2981.5989999999997
a stand

2978.48 --> 2985.839
in this delusional setup

2981.599 --> 2985.839
you think is happening right

2985.92 --> 2989.44
try to be interesting

2989.52 --> 2993.599
but yeah what else would you do when you

2991.2 --> 2995.4399999999996
literally don't even understand

2993.599 --> 2997.3590000000004
what somebody's talking about even when

2995.44 --> 3001.04
they explain it it must be

2997.359 --> 3004.24
extremely painful and you just

3001.04 --> 3007.52
hear it explained very carefully and you

3004.24 --> 3013.839
just can't understand it must be very

3007.52 --> 3013.839
tough man

3014.319 --> 3019.929
oh that's right yeah samson

3016.82 --> 3019.929
[Music]

3024.0 --> 3029.04
yeah i don't even understand why you

3026.0 --> 3031.76
thought you needed to do that

3029.04 --> 3034.079
simon dan you know one of your worst

3031.76 --> 3036.559
qualities although it is also for us

3034.079 --> 3037.44
for the flat earthers for your opponents

3036.559 --> 3040.88
a virtue

3037.44 --> 3043.92
is that you are so hilariously

3040.88 --> 3047.28
unapologetic about your absolute

3043.92 --> 3047.28
abject stupidity

3047.44 --> 3051.839
so that now we have the privilege of

3050.16 --> 3055.5989999999997
just being able to chant

3051.839 --> 3058.48
on with great joy you and your reference

3055.599 --> 3062.1600000000003
frames have been ruined simon dan

3058.48 --> 3062.88
it's hilarious because you double doubt

3062.16 --> 3066.8799999999997
on it

3062.88 --> 3066.88
you abject buffoon

3067.28 --> 3072.88
you literally don't know what the [ __ ]

3070.319 --> 3072.88
you're doing

3075.37 --> 3078.5
[Music]

3079.2 --> 3082.7999999999997
but yeah you're always welcome on my

3080.64 --> 3085.52
chat always welcome to come by as long

3082.8 --> 3085.52
as you behave

3086.079 --> 3090.559
and yeah compared to some ballers you

3088.16 --> 3093.2799999999997
are relatively well behaved

3090.559 --> 3094.7200000000003
so that's okay you know i allow jason

3093.28 --> 3097.44
mccormack in here too

3094.72 --> 3100.16
under certain conditions and i will do

3097.44 --> 3103.68
the same with you as long as you don't

3100.16 --> 3105.2
cause too much chaos here

3103.68 --> 3108.839
because we're just going to be at homing

3105.2 --> 3111.4399999999996
everyone i will eventually just kick you

3108.839 --> 3112.7999999999997
out

3111.44 --> 3116.4
now of course that's not going to

3112.8 --> 3118.88
exclude me from ad homing you

3116.4 --> 3121.04
but those at homes will all be based on

3118.88 --> 3123.2000000000003
well a historical record of your

3121.04 --> 3126.48
performances

3123.2 --> 3126.48
very specific at it

3132.72 --> 3138.7999999999997
wow so have you ever statistically

3136.4 --> 3139.76
actually tested that or is this just a

3138.8 --> 3143.28
really

3139.76 --> 3144.96
really transparent cheap bluff simon

3143.28 --> 3148.96
then

3144.96 --> 3151.44
if you actually actually tested

3148.96 --> 3152.0
that i don't think you have i think

3151.44 --> 3154.64
you're even

3152.0 --> 3156.559
too lazy to just look up stats and

3154.64 --> 3156.96
cross-reference and get a good judgment

3156.559 --> 3161.119
i think

3156.96 --> 3161.119
you didn't even do that did you

3161.76 --> 3166.599
because the statistics definitely do not

3164.839 --> 3171.2799999999997
point

3166.599 --> 3171.28
99.999 worldwide that's

3173.2 --> 3176.3999999999996
there's no statistics out there in the

3175.839 --> 3180.88
world

3176.4 --> 3182.2400000000002
even those that nasa brings out that say

3180.88 --> 3185.6800000000003
that

3182.24 --> 3195.839
so you did it again simon then

3185.68 --> 3195.839
you did it again

3215.839 --> 3223.839
ah well michael jones

3220.839 --> 3223.839
maybe

3225.76 --> 3229.44
but they could also be just

3229.52 --> 3232.8
like they could also be vultures you

3232.0 --> 3234.88
know

3232.8 --> 3237.04
because i've seen those even try and

3234.88 --> 3241.599
work their way in with me

3237.04 --> 3243.7599999999998
vultures and vultures are like fans

3241.599 --> 3245.52
that are usually a lot smarter than they

3243.76 --> 3247.3590000000004
pretend to be and they're just

3245.52 --> 3249.28
literally waiting for somebody to

3247.359 --> 3251.92
destroy themselves

3249.28 --> 3252.7200000000003
and then laugh really hard at it or

3251.92 --> 3255.28
basically

3252.72 --> 3257.04
study how somebody's destroying

3255.28 --> 3258.6400000000003
themselves with their own stupidity and

3257.04 --> 3261.04
how they degrade over time there's

3258.64 --> 3264.64
people that like that

3261.04 --> 3266.48
they're kind of creepy so i think this

3264.64 --> 3269.839
probably has a lot of those types of

3266.48 --> 3273.52
fans as well so i wouldn't say 99.999

3269.839 --> 3275.2
michael jones i think it would be more

3273.52 --> 3279.839
in the direction of

3275.2 --> 3279.839
80 to 90 percent

3286.079 --> 3291.599
oh that and that is kind of wet finger

3288.559 --> 3296.559
work but come on look simon dan dude

3291.599 --> 3296.559
he is like a just a train wreck

3296.799 --> 3300.4
waiting to happen like the train is on

3299.119 --> 3303.839
fire as it is

3300.4 --> 3304.319
rolling it's literally on fire it's

3303.839 --> 3307.52
burning

3304.319 --> 3308.48
the chassis is burning it's still going

3307.52 --> 3311.04
though

3308.48 --> 3312.48
but you know it's eventually going to

3311.04 --> 3316.799
just

3312.48 --> 3320.079
yeah either just go to a halt

3316.799 --> 3323.04
failure or it's going to crash you know

3320.079 --> 3325.44
this so there's bound to be some of

3323.04 --> 3327.68
these people

3325.44 --> 3329.92
that are hanging around over at him as

3327.68 --> 3329.9199999999996
well

3333.76 --> 3338.96
and some of them might even be flat

3335.359 --> 3338.96
earthers i know

3339.92 --> 3347.119
don't take it badly but tony

3343.839 --> 3351.52
has a bit of this it's like his trolley

3347.119 --> 3354.2400000000002
side because

3351.52 --> 3355.04
i guess that he just really can't stand

3354.24 --> 3357.2
that

3355.04 --> 3358.5589999999997
in some people and then he gets like

3357.2 --> 3361.52
that he's like

3358.559 --> 3362.6400000000003
waiting for them to wreck themselves

3361.52 --> 3365.52
because he finds

3362.64 --> 3368.24
like relief in it i guess because he

3365.52 --> 3370.48
just can't stand those people

3368.24 --> 3370.4799999999996
right

3374.0 --> 3378.96
just having some banter for all times

3376.16 --> 3382.0
yeah that's good for you

3378.96 --> 3385.04
so did i but i did kind of bring up

3382.0 --> 3386.799
just the short-term history i know it's

3385.04 --> 3387.119
very easy for you to forget all that and

3386.799 --> 3390.079
just

3387.119 --> 3391.28
start a new blank slate emphasizing

3390.079 --> 3395.119
blank

3391.28 --> 3396.799
as in empty void no worries there's no

3395.119 --> 3398.7200000000003
worries because you could just forget

3396.799 --> 3400.48
everything again

3398.72 --> 3403.04
seems like you're very comfortable with

3400.48 --> 3404.96
that to just go with a blank slate every

3403.04 --> 3407.2799999999997
single time

3404.96 --> 3409.52
but yeah you overlook that other people

3407.28 --> 3413.6800000000003
do keep track of what you do

3409.52 --> 3419.28
even if you don't and eventually it's

3413.68 --> 3421.839
yeah that blank slate's just gonna be

3419.28 --> 3425.6800000000003
full of [ __ ] every single time and you

3421.839 --> 3425.68
then know that and then it's like okay

3426.16 --> 3429.92
how many times do you want to keep

3427.76 --> 3431.8390000000004
wiping that slate

3429.92 --> 3434.4
don't don't you want anything other than

3431.839 --> 3437.44
just [ __ ] on that slate every single day

3434.4 --> 3438.48
wouldn't you like something cool that

3437.44 --> 3442.079
might be worth

3438.48 --> 3443.92
not wiping or has the wiping become such

3442.079 --> 3445.04
a habit that you can't even not do it

3443.92 --> 3448.319
anymore

3445.04 --> 3451.52
i wonder sometimes but

3448.319 --> 3451.52
anyway it's your life

3452.03 --> 3455.26
[Music]

3457.839 --> 3462.64
right and i'm gonna round out the show i

3459.92 --> 3462.64
think somewhere

3467.839 --> 3474.88
although nathan has not thrown out a

3470.64 --> 3478.319
link to the flat earth debates

3474.88 --> 3489.7000000000003
so i might keep it going for a while

3478.319 --> 3493.5299999999997
yeah i think i will

3489.7 --> 3493.5299999999997
[Music]

3500.799 --> 3508.559
hmm that's ah that's very sweet

3504.079 --> 3508.559
so i mean i know i'm nicer than nathan

3509.119 --> 3513.04
but it's a conditional niceness though

3512.24 --> 3516.4799999999996
you know that

3513.04 --> 3519.68
because if people get nasty then i

3516.48 --> 3519.68
might get nasty too

3528.24 --> 3534.0789999999997
yeah no link yeah no link either in the

3531.44 --> 3536.4
in skype no google panel link there's

3534.079 --> 3538.0
all there's a frustrated 10th man in the

3536.4 --> 3540.7200000000003
chat there

3538.0 --> 3545.119
of lust like what why am i not on the

3540.72 --> 3547.04
panel right now this is impossible

3545.119 --> 3549.359
so yeah that flatters debates are going

3547.04 --> 3552.88
to have some delay today

3549.359 --> 3559.359
apparently appeal to

3552.88 --> 3561.76
niceness fallacy

3559.359 --> 3563.119
all right adam i don't think we were

3561.76 --> 3565.76
really having an argument

3563.119 --> 3568.0
i did mention like well the reference

3565.76 --> 3569.92
frames that were ruined and all that

3568.0 --> 3571.76
into the tale but i'm not going to just

3569.92 --> 3573.92
repeat that over and over again like

3571.76 --> 3578.48
nathan would probably

3573.92 --> 3578.48
if cybendran was in his chat

3579.65 --> 3583.52
[Music]

3581.359 --> 3584.4
yeah that's right simone not everything

3583.52 --> 3588.72
is a fallacy

3584.4 --> 3601.839
although most things you do and claim

3588.72 --> 3601.839
do seem to be fallacies

3604.799 --> 3607.04
ah

3610.24 --> 3615.839
irony bye everyone where are you going

3616.319 --> 3620.24
my show is still going and there is no

3618.4 --> 3623.359
flat earth debates currently so i

3620.24 --> 3623.359
where are you going exactly

3626.319 --> 3630.079
and that is scaredy cat are you

3637.04 --> 3646.64
i was just wondering maybe maybe

3641.52 --> 3646.64
oh i'm off to wipe something hmm

3648.88 --> 3653.28
oh dude i i hope i didn't make you [ __ ]

3651.44 --> 3657.839
your pants

3653.28 --> 3657.8390000000004
but okay

3668.839 --> 3673.44
um

3670.16 --> 3675.1189999999997
because i did kind of want to know i

3673.44 --> 3678.4
want to kind of ask

3675.119 --> 3679.599
your thoughts about yeah the original

3678.4 --> 3681.599
statement

3679.599 --> 3684.799
reference frame 10 were ruined how you

3681.599 --> 3687.2000000000003
then addressed that

3684.799 --> 3688.559
that you still yeah when rumpus came on

3687.2 --> 3691.04
on the flatters debate you

3688.559 --> 3692.7200000000003
said in chat that you still believed in

3691.04 --> 3695.52
the reference frames and

3692.72 --> 3696.0
you never really responded to that you

3695.52 --> 3698.799
just

3696.0 --> 3700.88
kind of red hairing it with something

3698.799 --> 3703.44
nathan said some time ago that wasn't

3700.88 --> 3706.1600000000003
even relevant to the

3703.44 --> 3707.68
scenario that was discussed and didn't

3706.16 --> 3709.839
even have to do anything with reference

3707.68 --> 3713.839
frames i was wondering like

3709.839 --> 3716.0
could you explain to me how you see that

3713.839 --> 3718.24
like what made you think that our

3716.0 --> 3720.64
reference frames were ruined what that

3718.24 --> 3723.5989999999997
means what those reference frames are

3720.64 --> 3726.799
according to your insight

3723.599 --> 3730.079
and then also why

3726.799 --> 3733.119
you then still believe in reference

3730.079 --> 3737.3590000000004
frames as you stated it

3733.119 --> 3740.6400000000003
what that means now of course

3737.359 --> 3744.799
i'm presupposing in this occasion

3740.64 --> 3747.1189999999997
that you actually know why you said that

3744.799 --> 3749.0389999999998
and that presupposition is probably

3747.119 --> 3750.2400000000002
going to turn out to be dispelled

3749.039 --> 3752.4
because even if you did

3750.24 --> 3754.72
probably know at the time you've very

3752.4 --> 3756.4
likely forgotten

3754.72 --> 3758.64
because this seemed to be a reoccurring

3756.4 --> 3761.6800000000003
pattern

3758.64 --> 3766.839
that i've taken note of over the years

3761.68 --> 3769.839
or the months at least so but i'm just

3766.839 --> 3769.839
curious

3771.039 --> 3778.079
right but see that's not addressing

3774.88 --> 3778.799
my question though you know nothing is

3778.079 --> 3781.2000000000003
the whole thing

3778.799 --> 3782.16
out of context construction see but

3781.2 --> 3784.72
that's just you

3782.16 --> 3786.5589999999997
saying no he just doesn't understand he

3784.72 --> 3789.68
took it out of context but

3786.559 --> 3792.6400000000003
it doesn't address what

3789.68 --> 3794.0789999999997
you were actually thinking and saying

3792.64 --> 3797.2
and that is the part that i

3794.079 --> 3798.96
am curious to but yes

3797.2 --> 3800.96
the curiosity is based on the

3798.96 --> 3803.76
presupposition that you actually

3800.96 --> 3805.76
do have knowledge and recollection of

3803.76 --> 3808.2400000000002
what it was you were doing

3805.76 --> 3808.88
and that in reality may turn out to be

3808.24 --> 3811.9199999999996
yeah a

3808.88 --> 3814.559
little bridge too far so

3811.92 --> 3816.7200000000003
but i'm trying giving it an honest go

3814.559 --> 3817.2000000000003
you said i was much nicer than nathan so

3816.72 --> 3819.839
maybe

3817.2 --> 3820.96
you will somehow find the concentration

3819.839 --> 3824.0789999999997
to

3820.96 --> 3829.44
give a coherent response to this

3824.079 --> 3829.44
i don't know miracles can happen

3830.72 --> 3839.839
only way to know is to try it

3844.4 --> 3853.839
bye okay well see you later scaredy cat

3848.0 --> 3853.839
too bad i tried

3869.37 --> 3872.799
[Music]

3870.48 --> 3874.799
right yes chris berry yeah global's

3872.799 --> 3877.2
explanation of the 50 in our degree

3874.799 --> 3880.72
drift is that

3877.2 --> 3882.799
the earth moves as a whole as in

3880.72 --> 3884.799
like it is completely closed off from

3882.799 --> 3886.319
the outside and it's only the rest of

3884.799 --> 3888.319
space and the stars in the sun and the

3886.319 --> 3890.48
moon planets that are moving in relation

3888.319 --> 3892.16
to it

3890.48 --> 3894.4
when in reality that doesn't work

3892.16 --> 3897.1189999999997
because when you take things

3894.4 --> 3898.2400000000002
euclidean wise and that is a sensible

3897.119 --> 3901.2000000000003
thing to do which

3898.24 --> 3901.7599999999998
yeah gyroscopes gyroscope activity

3901.2 --> 3903.52
proves

3901.76 --> 3905.599
that it's very you have to take that

3903.52 --> 3907.52
very serious this is definitely

3905.599 --> 3909.92
stationary practically

3907.52 --> 3910.72
however you're going to circumdicularize

3909.92 --> 3912.96
things

3910.72 --> 3913.9199999999996
it's your own business but yeah in the

3912.96 --> 3915.76
real world

3913.92 --> 3917.44
things are definitely euclidean and

3915.76 --> 3921.599
stationary

3917.44 --> 3923.76
and yeah now i lost my train of thought

3921.599 --> 3926.96
damn it

3923.76 --> 3931.3590000000004
right again now i remember

3926.96 --> 3934.839
uh as the hangout title yesterday

3931.359 --> 3938.0789999999997
air is and gases are not susceptible to

3934.839 --> 3941.2799999999997
momentum so in any rotationary setup

3938.079 --> 3942.48
including a ball with presupposing gas

3941.28 --> 3945.6800000000003
sticking on top of it

3942.48 --> 3947.76
somehow not caring even that none of

3945.68 --> 3949.0389999999998
that works but just presupposing because

3947.76 --> 3951.76
i can

3949.039 --> 3952.559
i can and still round out the point and

3951.76 --> 3954.48
win

3952.559 --> 3955.599
despite the presuppositions that's why i

3954.48 --> 3957.2
do this

3955.599 --> 3958.96
right because i freaking know what i'm

3957.2 --> 3963.0389999999998
doing i've mastered

3958.96 --> 3967.2
this conceptualization mastered it

3963.039 --> 3969.039
right so in the rotationary setup of the

3967.2 --> 3970.8799999999997
presupposed spherical earth with gas

3969.039 --> 3974.6400000000003
somehow sticking to it as a ball

3970.88 --> 3977.44
in the outer space universe well

3974.64 --> 3978.5589999999997
the earth is rotating right so that

3977.44 --> 3983.039
means

3978.559 --> 3985.52
the gas will be subjected to some drag

3983.039 --> 3988.0
because it's not entirely cut off

3985.52 --> 3988.559
there's not a plate on one side of the

3988.0 --> 3990.96
earth

3988.559 --> 3993.3590000000004
literally pushing all that air with it

3990.96 --> 3995.359
in its rotation cycle

3993.359 --> 3996.799
causing an extra gradient no that's not

3995.359 --> 3997.839
happening there may be some towers here

3996.799 --> 4001.28
and there and all that

3997.839 --> 4003.599
mountains it just caused drag well that

4001.28 --> 4003.599
means

4003.68 --> 4012.0789999999997
that yeah the air is never

4006.96 --> 4014.0
going to reach full lock step completion

4012.079 --> 4015.3590000000004
because it is not susceptible to

4014.0 --> 4018.319
momentum

4015.359 --> 4018.5589999999997
drag local pressure differential because

4018.319 --> 4021.2
of

4018.559 --> 4024.1600000000003
objects pushing against the gas may

4021.2 --> 4028.0789999999997
cause some steering in it

4024.16 --> 4030.64
but yeah where it doesn't

4028.079 --> 4032.48
it's going to be pretty much euclidean

4030.64 --> 4034.319
stable the pressure is going to be

4032.48 --> 4036.16
stable in relation to everything around

4034.319 --> 4037.68
it only underneath it there's going to

4036.16 --> 4038.3999999999996
be some differentials and that means

4037.68 --> 4040.96
that the gas

4038.4 --> 4042.079
is not going to rotate in lockstep with

4040.96 --> 4044.799
the earth

4042.079 --> 4046.1600000000003
because it's not susceptible to momentum

4044.799 --> 4049.52
despite

4046.16 --> 4053.1189999999997
all the other laws being broken here

4049.52 --> 4053.119
through the presuppositional setup

4056.16 --> 4063.44
see so this

4060.839 --> 4065.2
conception about no the air moves in

4063.44 --> 4066.799
lockstep with the rotation of the earth

4065.2 --> 4070.319
is an ocean that is

4066.799 --> 4070.319
physically impossible

4073.44 --> 4078.319
the gas specifically specifically the

4077.44 --> 4081.28
gases and

4078.319 --> 4081.68
the objects i don't even care to address

4081.28 --> 4083.76
that

4081.68 --> 4085.52
in this example i could it's just not

4083.76 --> 4089.039
relevant but the gases

4085.52 --> 4092.16
specifically not subjected to momentum

4089.039 --> 4095.92
only to drag from physical objects

4092.16 --> 4098.0
they stick out in the supposed rotation

4095.92 --> 4099.759
and they're not going to move in

4098.0 --> 4101.92
lockstep rotation

4099.759 --> 4104.08
with the presupposed spherical spinning

4101.92 --> 4105.92
earth it's not going to happen

4104.08 --> 4108.08
can't happen because it's not

4105.92 --> 4111.12
susceptible to momentum it's never

4108.08 --> 4114.08
going to eventually reach that perfect

4111.12 --> 4114.719
lock step rotation with the rest of it

4114.08 --> 4116.839
can't

4114.719 --> 4119.839
because it's gas it's not susceptible to

4116.839 --> 4119.839
momentum

4122.08 --> 4124.48
all right

4126.719 --> 4133.92
let's see you know oakley on today

4130.56 --> 4136.719
maybe not i don't know he said he would

4133.92 --> 4136.719
have some delay

4138.56 --> 4148.2390000000005
i'm not seeing any links yet

4146.48 --> 4150.239
so yeah i'm gonna keep going who knows

4148.239 --> 4151.3589999999995
maybe it's gonna be a two two hour show

4150.239 --> 4160.879999999999
today

4151.359 --> 4162.4800000000005
i can do it i feel great

4160.88 --> 4164.2390000000005
or maybe one and a half hours you know

4162.48 --> 4168.3189999999995
that's typical

4164.239 --> 4168.3189999999995
for a longer show i'll probably get

4172.839 --> 4175.839
hungry

4194.239 --> 4197.678999999999
yes president biden

4197.84 --> 4202.96
the name is just now global's going to

4201.36 --> 4205.92
claim that trampoline guy

4202.96 --> 4207.679
should have flown away due to rotation

4205.92 --> 4210.719
right

4207.679 --> 4214.0
but that's the whole thing

4210.719 --> 4218.96
when that trampoline guy is

4214.0 --> 4222.08
shown it doesn't mean anything

4218.96 --> 4222.8
it literally what is said about it makes

4222.08 --> 4226.32
no sense

4222.8 --> 4226.719
no it's not happening it's just like oh

4226.32 --> 4230.08
look

4226.719 --> 4231.679
this proves something

4230.08 --> 4233.679
well it doesn't prove the rotation of

4231.679 --> 4237.1990000000005
the earth though

4233.679 --> 4237.1990000000005
but it still said that it does

4237.679 --> 4241.92
you got a link for 930

4242.84 --> 4247.76
what

4245.6 --> 4250.08
how much time is that from now julio of

4247.76 --> 4250.08
heaven

4250.32 --> 4259.84
is that in 20 minutes

4263.43 --> 4266.499000000001
[Music]

4272.02 --> 4276.129000000001
[Music]

4280.159 --> 4287.839999999999
in 20 minutes okay all right

4283.84 --> 4287.84
now 20 minutes not going to be a problem

4315.679 --> 4322.2390000000005
right anyway uh yeah

4320.08 --> 4328.5599999999995
what's next what's the next thing i'm

4322.239 --> 4330.32
going to talk about

4328.56 --> 4332.2390000000005
yeah what's the topic well i've been

4330.32 --> 4333.84
talking again about the same thing that

4332.239 --> 4336.718999999999
i addressed yesterday the title of

4333.84 --> 4339.6
yesterday's hangout the

4336.719 --> 4341.36
how air lacks susceptibility to momentum

4339.6 --> 4344.64
what that means how it could never

4341.36 --> 4345.599999999999
reach completion in the lockstep

4344.64 --> 4349.1990000000005
rotation of

4345.6 --> 4349.679
any kind of setup i've explained it to

4349.199 --> 4353.04
utter

4349.679 --> 4355.12
detail here today

4353.04 --> 4356.48
but yeah i don't know i don't really

4355.12 --> 4358.48
feel like repeating the whole thing

4356.48 --> 4360.159
again it's

4358.48 --> 4362.32
i've said pretty much everything about

4360.159 --> 4362.32
it

4364.719 --> 4370.0
i was not there okay that's no problem

4367.76 --> 4372.8
just re-watch the hangout it's it's

4370.0 --> 4372.8
gonna be worth it

4375.28 --> 4379.199
but i'm still going the live show for

4377.12 --> 4385.84
another

4379.199 --> 4385.839999999999
18 minutes

4386.159 --> 4392.5599999999995
no don't worry about it but

4389.28 --> 4393.599999999999
it literally just finished yeah rounding

4392.56 --> 4396.8
out the whole thing i

4393.6 --> 4399.84
it was funny because simon dan also came

4396.8 --> 4399.84
in chat for a bit

4404.0 --> 4407.84
who's of course now pretty famous

4406.88 --> 4412.159000000001
because of his

4407.84 --> 4415.28
reference frames our ruin statement

4412.159 --> 4417.199
nathan widely advertising that

4415.28 --> 4419.92
and he came in chat for a bit and i

4417.199 --> 4422.4
actually he really civilly asked him to

4419.92 --> 4426.32
explain his statement

4422.4 --> 4428.639999999999
and he didn't and then he kind of ran

4426.32 --> 4428.639999999999
away

4431.52 --> 4434.56
so yeah definitely worth re-watching

4434.239 --> 4437.199
that

4434.56 --> 4437.1990000000005
it was funny

4439.199 --> 4443.44
although i did kind of add home

4441.36 --> 4445.44
psychoanalyze him a bit

4443.44 --> 4447.678999999999
but i think that my statements were

4445.44 --> 4449.919999999999
really not too far i think it was

4447.679 --> 4452.159
pretty real assessment there it's it's

4449.92 --> 4455.84
just that reality can be pretty cruel

4452.159 --> 4455.839999999999
sometimes you know

4473.6 --> 4478.8
moons appear to orbit planets

4476.64 --> 4483.12
well the thing is michael jones i've

4478.8 --> 4485.679
never actually seen that

4483.12 --> 4485.679
myself

4486.159 --> 4492.719
it's supposedly out there

4489.52 --> 4497.84
but i've never just seen like like say

4492.719 --> 4497.84
like p900 footage of such thing

4500.48 --> 4504.799999999999
like something that's more direct

4502.48 --> 4507.599999999999
interactive

4504.8 --> 4508.56
are you sure that's not all purely based

4507.6 --> 4510.4800000000005
on like

4508.56 --> 4513.679
well the bigger telescopes and the

4510.48 --> 4516.799999999999
direct control of the helios interests

4513.679 --> 4519.28
as it were the writers or

4516.8 --> 4521.52
have people actually picked it up with

4519.28 --> 4524.4
their own devices

4521.52 --> 4525.52
that are not like super digitally

4524.4 --> 4531.04
enhanced and

4525.52 --> 4531.040000000001
yes prone to weird things

4533.199 --> 4538.159
now of course they don't prove anything

4536.159 --> 4539.599999999999
george stanford it's only about whether

4538.159 --> 4552.719
that phenomena is

4539.6 --> 4556.2390000000005
actually there

4552.719 --> 4557.28
amateur telescopes okay well make sure

4556.239 --> 4560.5599999999995
that's fascinating

4557.28 --> 4560.5599999999995
i've never seen it though

4563.92 --> 4568.4800000000005
i know i'd be very interested to see

4566.239 --> 4570.879999999999
like very well zoomed in telescope

4568.48 --> 4570.879999999999
footage

4571.44 --> 4578.32
of like a moon literally may i guess

4574.719 --> 4578.32
it's going to have to be time lapse

4578.719 --> 4585.28
of the moon going in an orbit

4582.159 --> 4589.44
of a planet supposed orbit that is

4585.28 --> 4590.4
the path over it whatever something like

4589.44 --> 4593.36
that

4590.4 --> 4596.48
in actual raw footage data and not some

4593.36 --> 4596.48
stupid animation

4596.88 --> 4609.84
because that would be very fascinating

4615.84 --> 4620.0
i don't know if p900 would be enough to

4618.08 --> 4623.12
see moons it's enough to see planet

4620.0 --> 4625.44
jupiter yeah

4623.12 --> 4637.84
i know you can kind of pick up plan the

4625.44 --> 4637.839999999999
planets with it

4642.159 --> 4644.48
hmm

4646.96 --> 4651.84
yeah i know what you mean big shoe

4662.719 --> 4666.32
yeah if i you know what if i'd had a

4665.679 --> 4669.12
little bit

4666.32 --> 4671.28
better mastery over the p900 because

4669.12 --> 4673.199
unfortunately

4671.28 --> 4675.199
i'm having just trouble really working

4673.199 --> 4676.639999999999
with it i haven't been able to really

4675.199 --> 4680.239
work out

4676.64 --> 4682.96
a more better way to like set the things

4680.239 --> 4685.04
correct the things and all of everything

4682.96 --> 4687.12
because if i would have i probably do a

4685.04 --> 4688.88
little more with it but it's just that

4687.12 --> 4691.04
often when i try things it's just like

4688.88 --> 4692.8
now i can't get it to focus i can't

4691.04 --> 4696.239
get it to do this it's just not working

4692.8 --> 4696.2390000000005
and pisses me off i

4698.64 --> 4702.320000000001
i never really got deeply into it now

4701.199 --> 4703.839999999999
during the daytime

4702.32 --> 4705.5199999999995
i don't have a lot of trouble with it

4703.84 --> 4707.52
but at night also

4705.52 --> 4709.6
you know just looking at that little

4707.52 --> 4710.159000000001
screen in the cold to try and figure out

4709.6 --> 4712.159000000001
what's

4710.159 --> 4715.679
what's not why it's not working it's

4712.159 --> 4715.679
just really frustrating

4718.84 --> 4721.84
so

4725.92 --> 4729.84
yeah of course samson the stars don't

4728.4 --> 4731.679
have anything to do with the shape of

4729.84 --> 4734.64
the ground but that doesn't mean that

4731.679 --> 4735.12
phenom celestial phenomenon phenomena

4734.64 --> 4739.1990000000005
are not

4735.12 --> 4749.84
interesting as phenomenon like what

4739.199 --> 4749.839999999999
what is that

4752.64 --> 4757.679
yeah victor i know it's yeah the

4755.84 --> 4759.679
celestial sphere has been used for

4757.679 --> 4763.1990000000005
orientation

4759.679 --> 4768.56
and navigation for

4763.199 --> 4768.5599999999995
well ever since creation pretty sure of

4770.96 --> 4774.1
[Music]

4774.84 --> 4777.84
that

4782.96 --> 4787.679
right oh yeah you're welcome big shoe

4788.239 --> 4792.239
ah nathan just

4792.64 --> 4796.159000000001
gave out the hangout link

4796.96 --> 4805.84
that's good

4816.84 --> 4819.84
now

4830.84 --> 4833.84
so

4844.84 --> 4849.6
hmm

4847.12 --> 4852.239
right fossils cannot give an accurate h

4849.6 --> 4852.2390000000005
that's correct

4854.159 --> 4861.36
because where fossil is found doesn't

4856.239 --> 4864.638999999999
really mean anything and fossils don't

4861.36 --> 4875.839999999999
petrify as slow as is assumed

4864.639 --> 4875.84
in the discipline of archaeology

4880.4 --> 4884.239
pole star has no parallax

4886.84 --> 4889.84
okay

4896.8 --> 4900.400000000001
it would be kind of interesting

4900.84 --> 4906.56
just to imagine though you know

4904.239 --> 4908.32
we got this issue now with the celestial

4906.56 --> 4909.92
bodies including the sun

4908.32 --> 4911.679
it does it it doesn't seem to be

4909.92 --> 4914.4800000000005
physical in any way right when you

4911.679 --> 4918.2390000000005
approach it it bends away and all that

4914.48 --> 4920.959999999999
i was wondering what would happen

4918.239 --> 4922.4
if you would actually try to go towards

4920.96 --> 4925.04
the pole star

4922.4 --> 4925.04
towards

4926.0 --> 4932.4
yet it

4929.04 --> 4933.76
will it bend away or what like will it

4932.4 --> 4936.48
just come towards

4933.76 --> 4938.2390000000005
seem to get closer and then it fades

4936.48 --> 4941.5199999999995
what would happen

4938.239 --> 4944.919999999999
because that thing is just

4941.52 --> 4946.400000000001
virtually in an exact it's like the most

4944.92 --> 4949.04
triangulatable thing

4946.4 --> 4949.04
you could say

4950.0 --> 4955.44
in different ways so yeah

4957.28 --> 4960.08
what would happen

4967.199 --> 4973.839999999999
okay make sure

4981.92 --> 4992.719
oh wait

4987.12 --> 4992.719
am i missing the show hold on

4998.84 --> 5001.84
no

5006.08 --> 5010.719
yeah i got a link but it's not live yet

5012.239 --> 5016.4
and just says waiting for at the moment

5019.52 --> 5021.76
uh

5023.36 --> 5029.839999999999
like here's the link

5035.12 --> 5043.84
oh that sounds very interesting iron rum

5038.639 --> 5043.84
iron fv hmm

5045.52 --> 5050.400000000001
oh yeah man but that's sounds pretty

5049.199 --> 5053.36
difficult

5050.4 --> 5054.4
to get that set up i don't know maybe

5053.36 --> 5056.88
it's easier than

5054.4 --> 5058.96
i would give it credit for but i would

5056.88 --> 5060.639
need i need some pointers by people that

5058.96 --> 5062.4800000000005
know how that works

5060.639 --> 5064.32
because that does sound very interesting

5062.48 --> 5065.04
and hey i have my computer right here if

5064.32 --> 5068.32
i just

5065.04 --> 5071.12
can interface like with a longer wire

5068.32 --> 5074.96
that would be actually kind of easy

5071.12 --> 5074.96
anyway i'm gonna round out the show guys

5075.36 --> 5081.28
so uh yeah thanks everyone for coming if

5079.92 --> 5083.12
you like the show then please don't
