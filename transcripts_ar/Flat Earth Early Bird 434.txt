appreciated you have to do it today the

68.34 --> 76.89
weather is cloudy again it's like a big

72.149 --> 103.47
gray soup not very windy not even that

76.89 --> 107.34
cold it's not so wet and I got to wear a

103.47 --> 109.349
coffee uh it's kind of my second one I

107.34 --> 116.22
had a really weird morning this morning

109.349 --> 118.34
I yeah it's weird night last night too I

116.22 --> 120.959
don't know I did actually manage to make

118.34 --> 125.58
that dinner with the rice and all that

120.959 --> 127.17
nasi for young high but yeah maybe I ate

125.58 --> 132.35999999999999
a little bit too much of it I don't know

127.17 --> 134.73
but it it I really trouble with it I

132.36 --> 140.59900000000002
think although I don't know what it was

134.73 --> 142.67
but I was a bit nauseated this morning

140.599 --> 145.42999999999998
I tried to call my healer called my dad

142.67 --> 149.23899999999998
instead because he's he seems to be

145.43 --> 151.519
learning the same trick it's been

149.239 --> 153.20000000000002
learning from my healer and this is

151.519 --> 155.72
quite functional it's not as quick

153.2 --> 162.17
though not as thorough but it does work

155.72 --> 165.049
and yeah then I took a shower and kind

162.17 --> 167.05999999999997
of like okay I feel literally like I

165.049 --> 172.67000000000002
need to restore so I went back to sleep

167.06 --> 173.739
and as a result I woke up about thirty

172.67 --> 177.319
minutes ago

173.739 --> 180.079
but I just needed it because I felt sick

177.319 --> 182.569
like if I had to stay up like that then

180.079 --> 184.519
I'd probably cancel the show for today

182.569 --> 187.849
because I just didn't feel good now I

184.519 --> 190.06900000000002
feel like it's mostly restored you know

187.849 --> 192.54899999999998
chad is frozen again thanks for pointing

190.069 --> 192.54899999999998
that out

196.7 --> 203.03
yeah I had a bit of weirdness with OBS

199.16 --> 205.52
as well by the way I don't know why yeah

203.03 --> 208.04
I said start streaming then it just

205.52 --> 212.09
didn't respond then I closed down

208.04 --> 215.92999999999998
OBS opened it back up and said yeah but

212.09 --> 218.17000000000002
it's so still running okay I can't see

215.93 --> 221.56
it running so I just did it anyway and

218.17 --> 224.55999999999997
while this this version seems to work

221.56 --> 224.56
but

227.81 --> 230.87
[Music]

235.3 --> 240.28
[Music]

237.819 --> 244.17999999999998
mark colored I don't know man if you're

240.28 --> 247.989
gonna suggest there some conspiracy

244.18 --> 250.18
going on we're now multiple times the

247.989 --> 253.269
same Wars a similar virus will be

250.18 --> 260.169
released that's quite a big conspiracy

253.269 --> 263.16
concept to go there I I wouldn't go that

260.169 --> 263.15999999999997
far at this point

292.27 --> 296.84999999999997
yeah George Sanford Bill Gates I know

297.33 --> 305.44
yeah he loves he loves the concept of

303.099 --> 306.599
the population we know it's bragged

305.44 --> 312.28
about it a lot

306.599 --> 314.46999999999997
it's crazy lectures how vaccines is

312.28 --> 319.13899999999995
gonna bring back population growth to

314.47 --> 322.949
zero oh yeah we know it's been endlessly

319.139 --> 322.949
played and hyped up

330.74 --> 333.74
yeah

333.87 --> 342.64
but yeah I'm mostly just gonna ignore it

339.15 --> 349.45
because to me it's just another cold

342.64 --> 351.88
really and even some to studies I've

349.45 --> 355.87
been hearing office yeah it was so funny

351.88 --> 358.62
that I don't really watch Alex Jones

355.87 --> 362.23
during this period because it's just all

358.62 --> 364.33
all fear porn and all that concerning

362.23 --> 366.58000000000004
such a disease it's typical he's always

364.33 --> 371.43
done that anytime something like this

366.58 --> 373.65999999999997
came out but he did also do some

371.43 --> 376.66
research it's funny how he basically

373.66 --> 380.86
reflected the things that I said and I

376.66 --> 385.51000000000005
didn't really do any actual research on

380.86 --> 387.66
the web for it I just know because it

385.51 --> 390.19
always kind of works like that that

387.66 --> 393.6
these types of diseases

390.19 --> 398.71
whatever you think they are they always

393.6 --> 400.33000000000004
really just are dangerous to people that

398.71 --> 402.43
are kind of weakened or severely

400.33 --> 405.60999999999996
demoralized as I call it because I'd

402.43 --> 408.67
like to emphasize that that it can be

405.61 --> 412.48
definitely be a factor as well just

408.67 --> 415.21000000000004
chronic demoralization will have a

412.48 --> 419.40000000000003
negative impact on our disease like that

415.21 --> 419.4
will strike so

419.41 --> 424.78900000000004
mosquitoes kill more than people and

421.88 --> 426.009
then kill more people than anything else

424.789 --> 431.5
really

426.009 --> 431.5
okay well malaria is a real thing

433.539 --> 443.599
malpractice indeed medical malpractice

438.289 --> 447.009
and yeah a lot of it is basically yeah

443.599 --> 449.389
shoved under the rug or whatever because

447.009 --> 451.21000000000004
it's not good for insurance and

449.389 --> 454.63
reputation blah blah blah

451.21 --> 462.77
but yeah these things do happen

454.63 --> 466.069
regularly even and it's rare that it

462.77 --> 470.12
really comes out eventually or that like

466.069 --> 475.25
a victim of it the family will then

470.12 --> 479.21
pursue it really just most times most

475.25 --> 481.22
people most common decent people when

479.21 --> 487.34
somebody in their family for some reason

481.22 --> 492.16900000000004
dies they just want to grieve and not go

487.34 --> 496.909
into yeah jalaw your judicial stuff and

492.169 --> 500.719
and all that discuss things [ __ ] because

496.909 --> 502.969
it is the extreme burden so it's logical

500.719 --> 505.61
that the most people would basically not

502.969 --> 508.969
pursue any kind of judicial actions or

505.61 --> 510.56
whatever interesting that's normal

508.969 --> 513.74
that's normal reaction and that is also

510.56 --> 516.95
part of the reason why it does happened

513.74 --> 522.6800000000001
and they all get away with it or most of

516.95 --> 526.339
them yeah it's just how reality works in

522.68 --> 529.0
a way but it's not good it's like a

526.339 --> 529.0
chronic problem

530.37 --> 537.13
that's why I generally don't really

533.59 --> 539.26
trust the medical system I can learn to

537.13 --> 547.87
trust individuals up to a certain degree

539.26 --> 553.9
oh yeah also my keyboard man yesterday

547.87 --> 556.45
was so stupid I I spilled just a little

553.9 --> 559.09
tiny bit of tea is just thing against it

556.45 --> 563.2
and flip little over it and it came into

559.09 --> 565.15
the corner of my keyboard and I didn't

563.2 --> 567.5200000000001
even really notice at first that some

565.15 --> 569.56
came in that kind of thing does happen

567.52 --> 571.0
not really bad it's not like him poring

569.56 --> 573.6999999999999
over entire glass of water

571.0 --> 576.64
but for some reason that caused my

573.7 --> 579.1600000000001
keyboards shift key to get stuck and it

576.64 --> 581.4399999999999
was really weird like I couldn't get get

579.16 --> 583.3
it off the caps lock and the caps lock

581.44 --> 586.21
was reversed so I had to exchange my

583.3 --> 588.6099999999999
keyboard for another one I had two other

586.21 --> 591.46
ones one of which is just I think it's

588.61 --> 594.28
permanently stuck with that one there's

591.46 --> 595.87
like six keys that are just permanently

594.28 --> 598.3
they don't function anymore it's not

595.87 --> 599.77
fine simple keyboard anymore it's been

598.3 --> 602.53
like that forever I'm probably going to

599.77 --> 605.04
throw that one away or try to but the

602.53 --> 609.9399999999999
other one does still sort of work but

605.04 --> 613.27
it's not in the best of conditions if

609.94 --> 617.47
you see what I mean it's like that

613.27 --> 622.99
spacebar I got a bit pissed off but it

617.47 --> 628.83
still functions somewhat but yeah but to

622.99 --> 628.83
replace it with a very crappy one and

632.33 --> 636.01
it's a hard-knock life yeah

637.16 --> 641.03
now but the keys aren't stuck they are

639.17 --> 644.78
not mechanically stuck it's the

641.03 --> 650.39
electronics underneath and you can't get

644.78 --> 653.2099999999999
the plastic off really or well not

650.39 --> 655.79
without literally getting every single

653.21 --> 659.02
key out and just but that will take

655.79 --> 661.37
maybe 2 hours 2 or 3 hours to do that

659.02 --> 663.59
I've never tried that before

661.37 --> 666.71
but it's not the key getting literally

663.59 --> 669.94
stuck it is the electrics below it

666.71 --> 672.74
basically short-circuiting in a way and

669.94 --> 674.99
because that happens typically when

672.74 --> 677.1800000000001
moist gets in whatever

674.99 --> 679.58
that's why then just put it back in the

677.18 --> 683.06
closet and leave it there for a while

679.58 --> 684.86
and then usually the next time I bring

683.06 --> 688.88
it out which will be at least a week

684.86 --> 690.38
later sometimes a year it's all dried up

688.88 --> 692.18
and it works perfectly again and I've

690.38 --> 698.12
been doing that with the same keyboards

692.18 --> 702.92
for 20 years these keyboards are very

698.12 --> 704.57
old and they keep working the sometimes

702.92 --> 706.8199999999999
they get stuck then they put them back

704.57 --> 708.38
in the closet and then after a while

706.82 --> 711.08
they work again that's why I keep using

708.38 --> 715.18
them and they have this great click it's

711.08 --> 715.1800000000001
a good old fashioned keyboard anyway

718.89 --> 724.58
oh Jesus seeking truth that sucks man

726.92 --> 729.549
yeah

730.09 --> 736.87
well did you have any hint that he was

734.74 --> 738.88
gonna do anything like that because

736.87 --> 743.23
usually people that actually do that

738.88 --> 746.14
they sit on it for some time and then

743.23 --> 749.9200000000001
eventually they they kind of make up

746.14 --> 752.59
their mind as to do it and it's really

749.92 --> 754.3
difficult to stop it at that point

752.59 --> 756.36
usually the only way to really get it

754.3 --> 761.29
done is to get them committed but it's

756.36 --> 764.47
yeah it sucks man I experienced

761.29 --> 769.9
something similar and in some way I even

764.47 --> 772.63
blame myself for it because I yeah

769.9 --> 777.6899999999999
good friend of my love a friend of my

772.63 --> 780.97
friend circle back then in school he was

777.69 --> 785.1700000000001
17 at the time so I was even younger and

780.97 --> 790.4100000000001
he had like depression issues and it's

785.17 --> 794.4399999999999
like severe the morality like he didn't

790.41 --> 796.66
like the world he a lot of trouble not

794.44 --> 799.24
just being able to be his sensitive self

796.66 --> 801.8199999999999
and keeping control over his emotion was

799.24 --> 803.89
very tough for him and I thought like

801.82 --> 806.38
this guy is really sensitive he has

803.89 --> 808.3
sensibility to him just has a lot of

806.38 --> 809.89
trouble dealing with it I want to help I

808.3 --> 813.67
want to be his life friend and help him

809.89 --> 816.06
teach that [ __ ] but he basically he kind

813.67 --> 816.06
of gave up

816.71 --> 823.01
and it was to me pretty sudden but in a

820.339 --> 824.75
way we were also pushing the problem was

823.01 --> 826.55
because of his attitude because of his

824.75 --> 828.26
emotional issues he had like a social

826.55 --> 830.899
position for himself where he would

828.26 --> 834.23
played like the underdog pretty badly

830.899 --> 836.209
and it was tough for us even for me not

834.23 --> 839.27
to basically poke at him for it it's

836.209 --> 842.4799999999999
like yeah you're you're a fool that's

839.27 --> 845.12
the way you present yourself so we're

842.48 --> 850.79
gonna push you a bit and we did that as

845.12 --> 854.3
well and he kind of even warned us like

850.79 --> 856.5799999999999
I'm feeling kind of bad and we were like

854.3 --> 860.0
and I was like yeah come on just man up

856.58 --> 863.63
you know but in retrospect that turned

860.0 --> 865.91
out to be bad because the next day you

863.63 --> 867.459
got a phone call that he had basically

865.91 --> 873.41
jumped in front of a train

867.459 --> 878.4499999999999
horrific so yeah I feel your pain man it

873.41 --> 881.56
sucks that's sorry to bring it up well

878.45 --> 881.5600000000001
you started it but

884.28 --> 890.02
the problem well anybody that that has

887.56 --> 893.3199999999999
somebody they know or somebody in their

890.02 --> 899.71
life that does that just realize that it

893.32 --> 901.9200000000001
is extremely rare that it just comes out

899.71 --> 901.9200000000001
of nowhere

907.09 --> 912.3000000000001
it's like yeah that's basically it

918.58 --> 926.62
and also it is anyway it is just don't

923.98 --> 930.269
want to get too far into it let's just

926.62 --> 932.649
say you have to have a certain degree of

930.269 --> 935.05
determination in order to even be able

932.649 --> 948.67
to do that or your their instincts will

935.05 --> 951.5999999999999
just stop them so it's almost like but

948.67 --> 951.5999999999999
it is what it is

954.64 --> 957.24
yeah

967.38 --> 977.36
can I turn my mic up is my volume low

969.87 --> 981.15
what oh maybe it is no no it's not

977.36 --> 984.99
how is that possible last time why is

981.15 --> 985.62
the volume so off these days this is

984.99 --> 989.4
weird

985.62 --> 992.1
how about this is this better loo loo

989.4 --> 998.49
loo loo yeah it still seems somewhat

992.1 --> 1001.82
look I don't get it like the volume

998.49 --> 1008.96
settings don't seem to be the same so

1001.82 --> 1012.2600000000001
odd putting it 260 now right normally

1008.96 --> 1015.1700000000001
it's 10/10 is pretty high now it's 16

1012.26 --> 1017.11
and seems somewhat similar to previous

1015.17 --> 1026.36
said I don't know why that is it's just

1017.11 --> 1032.99
OBS man what are you doing hey thanks

1026.36 --> 1036.1699999999998
Amanda you anyway

1032.99 --> 1037.79
I think another issue also little that

1036.17 --> 1040.01
also came forward the conversation with

1037.79 --> 1045.73
my dad is that I don't know my birthday

1040.01 --> 1050.3
is approaching it's like a week now

1045.73 --> 1055.13
exactly so yes

1050.3 --> 1063.4099999999999
my birthday will be this Thursday next

1055.13 --> 1067.0100000000002
Thursday next week and normally I don't

1063.41 --> 1070.42
really mind but this time I just can't

1067.01 --> 1074.66
say I feel great about it because I

1070.42 --> 1079.25
maybe it is just the social issue with

1074.66 --> 1083.63
the concept of being becoming 40 like 40

1079.25 --> 1087.58
right and they called midlife crisis for

1083.63 --> 1092.72
a lot of people for a lot of men and I

1087.58 --> 1094.25
don't know I just you know when I took a

1092.72 --> 1096.6100000000001
look I take a good look at myself

1094.25 --> 1099.5
constantly but said especially like

1096.61 --> 1104.12
where did I thought 10 years ago where I

1099.5 --> 1110.69
would be and to be fair this is not

1104.12 --> 1112.4289999999999
exactly it really it's I really expected

1110.69 --> 1115.24
I would be out of poverty

1112.429 --> 1115.24
really

1116.39 --> 1121.01
hey the years not over yet you know but

1121.4 --> 1128.52
can't say I feel good about it quarter

1126.03 --> 1129.71
life right quarter life that's

1128.52 --> 1134.61
interesting

1129.71 --> 1137.66
maybe I in a way I hope to grow very old

1134.61 --> 1143.54
but in a way that I will have my health

1137.66 --> 1146.46
so much scan as humanly possible and

1143.54 --> 1150.24
also with purpose you know I'd never

1146.46 --> 1153.54
imagine what having to live that long

1150.24 --> 1159.98
and and not have a purpose for living

1153.54 --> 1159.98
that man that but that's hell you know

1160.46 --> 1165.5
but I don't know how long I will live

1168.72 --> 1174.57
I did still feel well I do feel like

1172.08 --> 1177.749
yeah it's it's been a while now yeah

1174.57 --> 1179.879
don't feel like oh I just I just arrived

1177.749 --> 1182.72
no absolutely not I do feel like I've

1179.879 --> 1182.7199999999998
been here for a while

1182.779 --> 1193.549
but you know maybe a quarter does feel

1189.169 --> 1196.679
yeah it it feels I could experience a

1193.549 --> 1199.59
lot more and I could basically at this

1196.679 --> 1201.659
point start experiencing almost exactly

1199.59 --> 1206.369
everything yeah literally the things I

1201.659 --> 1209.0700000000002
had throughout my life and I would be

1206.369 --> 1212.2099999999998
able to deal with them a hundred times

1209.07 --> 1212.21
better than I did before

1221.95 --> 1231.0900000000001
I win I'm not a gangster I hate that

1226.36 --> 1234.09
word but I appreciate the gesture and

1231.09 --> 1234.09
cd20

1242.24 --> 1247.73
I'm Aquarius yeah I know it's very

1246.44 --> 1250.1000000000001
typical it's always just said no

1247.73 --> 1253.519
Aquarius yeah created it didn't it

1250.1 --> 1257.869
so yeah I'm apparently a very typical

1253.519 --> 1259.58
Aquarius a lot of people that are into

1257.869 --> 1262.1
that will hear that and say oh yeah oh

1259.58 --> 1266.83
that makes a lot of sense with this guy

1262.1 --> 1266.83
but yep

1281.25 --> 1285.44
yeah

1283.41 --> 1285.44
ah

1296.62 --> 1307.84
well not all the queries is our good a

1299.83 --> 1311.96
menu problem what Aquarius is also that

1307.84 --> 1315.529
they can be people very very apt at

1311.96 --> 1321.44
wasting their own time and they I got

1315.529 --> 1323.389
that talent but a lot of people I met

1321.44 --> 1326.45
that our queries are so good at it that

1323.389 --> 1328.1
they just constantly after Aquarius is

1326.45 --> 1333.769
typically have their own world in their

1328.1 --> 1338.809
mind for some reason and a lot of them

1333.769 --> 1343.429
have tendencies to stick there a little

1338.809 --> 1345.74
bit too much to pass by things in the

1343.429 --> 1348.0700000000002
world because they're distracted by

1345.74 --> 1350.75
their own things in their mind and

1348.07 --> 1357.47
that's typically me as well that has

1350.75 --> 1359.179
been me a lot of times because just

1357.47 --> 1361.3990000000001
because you see more doesn't mean you

1359.179 --> 1365.1100000000001
literally engage with all of that which

1361.399 --> 1368.51
you see no overwhelm it many times and

1365.11 --> 1370.9699999999998
I'll trigger thoughts and thought

1368.51 --> 1372.94
processes and analyzes analyzation

1370.97 --> 1375.98
processes but at the same time that

1372.94 --> 1378.519
practically closes off the attention and

1375.98 --> 1381.769
the social engagement and then

1378.519 --> 1383.8990000000001
opportunities and things and even

1381.769 --> 1386.179
getting to know people will pass by

1383.899 --> 1388.309
because of it so that's I don't know

1386.179 --> 1391.519
maybe it's just me I think it is

1388.309 --> 1396.94
typically Aquarius but I could be wrong

1391.519 --> 1396.94
here yeah this is

1397.36 --> 1404.649
bit over generalized

1399.47 --> 1404.6490000000001
typicall typicall astrology so

1405.82 --> 1409.02
[Music]

1412.38 --> 1419.25
oh really seeking star water well that's

1416.28 --> 1421.799
special yeah I would I kind of wanted to

1419.25 --> 1424.23
mention that the start of the Age of

1421.799 --> 1426.71
Aquarius is it that is it was it this

1424.23 --> 1429.179
Psaltis solstice that specifically

1426.71 --> 1435.2
because I heard that I was around for a

1429.179 --> 1438.0300000000002
while but kind of makes sense to me

1435.2 --> 1441.45
because I did have like the big switch

1438.03 --> 1444.26
after all in December kind of right

1441.45 --> 1444.26
before the Solstice

1451.06 --> 1461.47
and I do feel like yeah this world that

1458.53 --> 1466.45
is also all in a way - you know when I

1461.47 --> 1470.02
was younger I literally felt in my soul

1466.45 --> 1473.1100000000001
my conscious like there is so I can

1470.02 --> 1477.16
barely do anything with this world like

1473.11 --> 1478.56
this world isn't mine what is there to

1477.16 --> 1480.97
do for me

1478.56 --> 1485.94
everything I saw all the stupidity of

1480.97 --> 1488.38
the pillow unwillingness and just

1485.94 --> 1492.3700000000001
demonic tendencies that I saw that

1488.38 --> 1495.4
people would go far below decency

1492.37 --> 1497.8
because of some incompetence issue that

1495.4 --> 1499.5700000000002
kind of I saw a lot of negativity very

1497.8 --> 1505.08
detailed and I thought like wow this

1499.57 --> 1511.24
world's not mine I what am I doing here

1505.08 --> 1513.84
why was I with my consciousness inserted

1511.24 --> 1516.91
into this world it makes no sense to me

1513.84 --> 1522.85
because people are just freaking stupid

1516.91 --> 1524.92
and I'm sensitive and people hate me the

1522.85 --> 1527.23
yeah this is not a very positive way to

1524.92 --> 1531.16
look at it right well that's was my

1527.23 --> 1533.14
problem and eventually that problem

1531.16 --> 1534.97
turned in that frustration turned

1533.14 --> 1537.16
literally into self hate I started

1534.97 --> 1538.99
hating myself because I was so different

1537.16 --> 1540.73
and I couldn't connect and I was

1538.99 --> 1544.27
constantly being reminded about that

1540.73 --> 1546.7
it's kind of how that works so yeah I

1544.27 --> 1553.71
had serious issues with that I've had

1546.7 --> 1556.21
that deep until my 20s although I was

1553.71 --> 1558.82
actively working on it because I kind of

1556.21 --> 1560.89
started in my teenage times when I was

1558.82 --> 1562.87
getting interested in psychology also

1560.89 --> 1565.51
because of my parents issues and I had

1562.87 --> 1568.9899999999998
to start to figure out like oh wait I

1565.51 --> 1571.09
guess I have I thought at it of it like

1568.99 --> 1573.97
that it I thought like this sort of a

1571.09 --> 1576.6699999999998
depression issue so I'm gonna work at it

1573.97 --> 1580.69
I'm gonna build myself depression

1576.67 --> 1582.8700000000001
typically makes you give up let go take

1580.69 --> 1586.0900000000001
no more effort

1582.87 --> 1589.09
died down in energy so I was like okay I

1586.09 --> 1592.6899999999998
gotta build it so that's how all of this

1589.09 --> 1596.6789999999999
oh my speaking art all my explanation

1592.69 --> 1599.549
about myself all the the difficult

1596.679 --> 1601.6000000000001
honesty all of that came out it's my

1599.549 --> 1604.899
psychological self building that came

1601.6 --> 1610.6899999999998
out of all that and now now that I am

1604.899 --> 1615.399
this now that this to 30 20 years later

1610.69 --> 1619.3890000000001
I feel this world is mine not literally

1615.399 --> 1624.2689999999998
my possession but I feel I got things to

1619.389 --> 1626.9499999999998
do here I have seen so many things that

1624.269 --> 1630.909
could be improved that could be helped

1626.95 --> 1634.3890000000001
that mistakes that could be prevented

1630.909 --> 1637.24
and I kind of know how now you have to

1634.389 --> 1639.279
work before they happen you have to feel

1637.24 --> 1642.789
it coming because all the mistakes are

1639.279 --> 1645.039
always coming but you got to know when

1642.789 --> 1646.48
somebody's going to make a mistake you

1645.039 --> 1647.95
got to feel it coming even though you

1646.48 --> 1651.1490000000001
don't know exactly what it's gonna be

1647.95 --> 1655.3890000000001
yet although you might see it and then

1651.149 --> 1657.279
for them the right energies they need

1655.389 --> 1661.4499999999998
they're the right type of feeling that

1657.279 --> 1665.35
the right confidence or the right type

1661.45 --> 1667.69
of vigilance that they will then then

1665.35 --> 1669.4289999999999
might be able to absorb because they

1667.69 --> 1671.95
have no direct objection yet because

1669.429 --> 1675.0700000000002
they don't see the choice coming and

1671.95 --> 1677.1390000000001
then have that frequency as as part of

1675.07 --> 1678.6899999999998
them to potentially make better

1677.139 --> 1682.12
decisions I don't know it sounds very

1678.69 --> 1685.1490000000001
esoteric so it's very ethereal not as

1682.12 --> 1686.83
ethereal I know but it's one of the

1685.149 --> 1691.059
things that I figured out like yeah I

1686.83 --> 1694.32
can actually you know what's a real way

1691.059 --> 1697.09
do things that originally I thought

1694.32 --> 1701.379
there's just nothing I could do with

1697.09 --> 1703.9289999999999
this because it doesn't work with direct

1701.379 --> 1706.24
actions you can't just oh the mistake is

1703.929 --> 1708.3400000000001
happening I go there I say it's a

1706.24 --> 1709.09
mistake or guess what much people will

1708.34 --> 1712.4189999999999
say yeah

1709.09 --> 1713.9189999999999
leave me alone or you're a troll or you

1712.419 --> 1714.75
don't know what you're talking about or

1713.919 --> 1717.6000000000001
get emotion

1714.75 --> 1725.43
or that's the issue a lot of the issue

1717.6 --> 1730.8
so you got a feel the things coming and

1725.43 --> 1732.8100000000002
then see you can kind of forward the

1730.8 --> 1738.06
right energy that they will need in

1732.81 --> 1739.62
order to deal with the choice or even a

1738.06 --> 1741.78
fault bad choice with the mistake

1739.62 --> 1744.9899999999998
afterward to deal with that I know

1741.78 --> 1746.61
sounds very ethereal I know but it's one

1744.99 --> 1750.09
of the things that I feel I can at least

1746.61 --> 1753.8999999999999
try to get good at and it's somewhat

1750.09 --> 1757.8
works but it's so it's so you can't

1753.9 --> 1759.7800000000002
really you can only feel it you can feel

1757.8 --> 1764.25
it and pay attention to it there's no

1759.78 --> 1768.17
other way I can really describe the

1764.25 --> 1773.55
process but it is ethereal it's an

1768.17 --> 1778.89
instinctive process instinct warns you

1773.55 --> 1780.81
my senses enable my instincts to the

1778.89 --> 1783.6200000000001
sense pick it up and give me that

1780.81 --> 1786.6799999999998
morning and then I have to understand

1783.62 --> 1790.1999999999998
the senses and the instinct and

1786.68 --> 1793.8500000000001
recognize the type of pulse that I get

1790.2 --> 1797.13
from it and then learn to distinguish

1793.85 --> 1802.56
like what is my instinct actually

1797.13 --> 1804.93
telling me and that is probably one of

1802.56 --> 1806.4299999999998
the most difficult things in a person's

1804.93 --> 1810.03
life they can figure out and one of

1806.43 --> 1812.55
their most precious tools that they

1810.03 --> 1816.06
develop during their lifetime some

1812.55 --> 1818.25
people call it their gut instinct but

1816.06 --> 1823.23
yeah your gut instinct is never wrong

1818.25 --> 1825.33
really but if you don't understand it if

1823.23 --> 1830.73
you know if you can distinguish then you

1825.33 --> 1832.77
can make mistakes and you will the

1830.73 --> 1836.52
instinct to also tell you that afterward

1832.77 --> 1839.76
but it's very yeah eventually you anyway

1836.52 --> 1843.74
it's gut instinct it's difficult it's

1839.76 --> 1843.74
very important but it's also very

1844.96 --> 1852.43
elusive to the intellect and that's just

1850.3 --> 1854.61
a fact its elusive to the intellects

1852.43 --> 1857.14
even hard to describe what's even

1854.61 --> 1861.52
potentially going on during these

1857.14 --> 1864.67
processes but you can learn to work with

1861.52 --> 1866.98
it it's just like getting to know a

1864.67 --> 1869.23
difficult person that you have to work

1866.98 --> 1871.18
with that is kind of willing to work

1869.23 --> 1873.1
with you but they will be difficult and

1871.18 --> 1875.92
it is a challenge and they will rub you

1873.1 --> 1877.57
the wrong way sometimes and you got to

1875.92 --> 1881.92
work with it and then eventually you

1877.57 --> 1884.29
figure it out but you can't always most

1881.92 --> 1887.02
people can't even describe how they

1884.29 --> 1889.24
figured it out or how they worked it can

1887.02 --> 1892.24
somewhat roughly describe it but your

1889.24 --> 1895.84
instinct knows and your mind knows

1892.24 --> 1899.44
exactly the patterns even though you

1895.84 --> 1904.03
can't describe it well getting to know

1899.44 --> 1905.89
your gut instinct in general it is kind

1904.03 --> 1910.78
of the same process it is just as

1905.89 --> 1912.88
elusive just as instinctive but if you

1910.78 --> 1914.28
just if you if you pay a lot of

1912.88 --> 1917.71
attention figure it out

1914.28 --> 1920.47
don't pooh-pooh your instincts or don't

1917.71 --> 1922.57
punish yourself don't think that your

1920.47 --> 1924.52
instincts can be wrong usually it is the

1922.57 --> 1928.59
insight that is wrong and not the

1924.52 --> 1932.76
instinct if you do that then you can

1928.59 --> 1935.76
yeah build a whole new skill with that

1932.76 --> 1935.76
anyway

1942.54 --> 1951.82
so yeah but it is such a big difference

1948.07 --> 1956.62
now when 20 years ago because I do feel

1951.82 --> 1962.29
like there's so much I could do now and

1956.62 --> 1963.82
that would make sense because a lot of

1962.29 --> 1966.52
the things that were presented to me

1963.82 --> 1969.25
when I was young as what I could do

1966.52 --> 1972.76
where I could go it all just felt

1969.25 --> 1978.04
terrible also part of the reason why I

1972.76 --> 1980.77
never really got a career because every

1978.04 --> 1984.24
time I saw people in such career they I

1980.77 --> 1989.47
could pick up all kinds of things and

1984.24 --> 1993.3700000000001
just I realized like all of these people

1989.47 --> 1997.1200000000001
are doing this because they are

1993.37 --> 2001.05
basically it is almost like a folk it is

1997.12 --> 2003.51
an instinct to this folk approach it's

2001.05 --> 2005.79
just like working and you have to work

2003.51 --> 2007.77
you have to do that and it is does

2005.79 --> 2009.75
function but there's so many problems

2007.77 --> 2013.17
that come with it and I just saw like

2009.75 --> 2017.07
wow if I'm gonna do this if I'm

2013.17 --> 2023.3100000000002
literally gonna go like that then all

2017.07 --> 2027.29
these senses all this all this the magic

2023.31 --> 2027.29
of it it will die

2028.549 --> 2039.32
it will always just be an old dusty toy

2032.919 --> 2041.479
and I couldn't get myself to to go with

2039.32 --> 2044.33
that I thought there has to be another

2041.479 --> 2047.3890000000001
way that the world has to change in

2044.33 --> 2051.0789999999997
order for me to find another way and

2047.389 --> 2057.6189999999997
weirdly enough it seemed like it has a

2051.079 --> 2064.159
little but now I got a I gotta finish it

2057.619 --> 2067.52
I gotta go the rest of the way and find

2064.159 --> 2071.21
that entrance through the way that I've

2067.52 --> 2074.089
come which is a very unusual way a way

2071.21 --> 2077.539
where you don't really have a a working

2074.089 --> 2081.319
career but I think it's still possible

2077.539 --> 2087.25
because of skills because if I can make

2081.319 --> 2093.2
myself indispensable in some way then

2087.25 --> 2095.869
could still get ya find an entrance and

2093.2 --> 2097.73
I hope I'll get to that point and at the

2095.869 --> 2103.819
same time there's other projects thanks

2097.73 --> 2106.25
to my dad also the GTI company that's

2103.819 --> 2108.47
still going it's not very rewarding at

2106.25 --> 2111.77
this time for me but it is very

2108.47 --> 2116.359
promising and there's just yeah it's

2111.77 --> 2118.52
also a bit of a dip into the financial

2116.359 --> 2120.589
world and what's going on there and

2118.52 --> 2123.109
developments in cryptocurrency I get to

2120.589 --> 2125.23
learn a little bit about that because of

2123.109 --> 2125.23
it

2127.609 --> 2130.609
he

2131.77 --> 2140.5
so who knows no I have ideas now I have

2137.7 --> 2143.46
things like yeah they would be cool to

2140.5 --> 2147.49
have like products that I could sell or

2143.46 --> 2155.35
just I don't know I kind of start to

2147.49 --> 2159.1
like the idea of sort of company set up

2155.35 --> 2164.58
some kind but I just want to do it my

2159.1 --> 2168.1
way I don't want to get the full scale

2164.58 --> 2171.67
modern liberal adaptation version and go

2168.1 --> 2175.47
like that you so yeah I might work sort

2171.67 --> 2179.16
of but I don't want that I don't want to

2175.47 --> 2183.22
be forced in some kind of weird

2179.16 --> 2186.1
corporate position in my act no I I

2183.22 --> 2189.1299999999997
wanted if I'd run a company

2186.1 --> 2191.44
I want that company to be natural and

2189.13 --> 2192.73
following basically my principles as

2191.44 --> 2196.78
much as possible you know you can't

2192.73 --> 2198.76
expect people that work for you to to be

2196.78 --> 2201.5800000000004
exactly like you that's ridiculous I

2198.76 --> 2205.48
wouldn't expect everybody to be super

2201.58 --> 2208.72
open about everything for example but it

2205.48 --> 2211.81
would require that that would be

2208.72 --> 2213.3999999999996
respected look I respect law of course

2211.81 --> 2219.52
that's those things are loves you I

2213.4 --> 2223.21
don't know but who knows I do know I do

2219.52 --> 2228.73
now at least look out for opportunities

2223.21 --> 2230.83
where 20 years ago I would not even

2228.73 --> 2235.119
though it seemed like some were handed

2230.83 --> 2237.97
out to me I was just so retracted that I

2235.119 --> 2240.369
just thought no I'm not gonna fall for

2237.97 --> 2245.7999999999997
this trap because everything felt like a

2240.369 --> 2248.92
trap and now I'm not being handed all

2245.8 --> 2251.79
these opportunities but I guess I'm

2248.92 --> 2254.2000000000003
getting sense that I am apparently

2251.79 --> 2257.109
comforted at some things because I get

2254.2 --> 2258.6
competition feelings from people also a

2257.109 --> 2262.0299999999997
bit

2258.6 --> 2264.31
not that I feel competing but it feels

2262.03 --> 2267.73
like other people do feel my presence

2264.31 --> 2270.7
here and that I can do things and not

2267.73 --> 2276.16
just a fool hanging around thank God

2270.7 --> 2280.7799999999997
and I'm looking out for potential

2276.16 --> 2285.12
opportunities but I'm not super

2280.78 --> 2285.1200000000003
desperate it's not like that anyway

2295.36 --> 2304.21
oh right crank is fuzzy TM yeah sorry I

2298.15 --> 2307.35
didn't get to that I will get to you and

2304.21 --> 2307.35
we will do that video

2317.85 --> 2325.91
oh god by the way the debates yesterday

2320.79 --> 2327.15
god that whole thing between Tony and

2325.91 --> 2330.5699999999997
Nathan

2327.15 --> 2337.35
I listened back yesterday at a distance

2330.57 --> 2339.9900000000002
kind of it took so long my god well like

2337.35 --> 2343.46
I had to leave that panel at the time

2339.99 --> 2350.58
because it was just too much for me so

2343.46 --> 2351.54
nitpicky so tense yeah Riley was Matt

2350.58 --> 2354.0299999999997
Goss stubborn

2351.54 --> 2361.77
it was Riley level stubborn but the

2354.03 --> 2367.71
whole thing was basically a because it

2361.77 --> 2371.49
was like academics very deep academic

2367.71 --> 2374.55
[ __ ] with a lot of tension and it's just

2371.49 --> 2377.2799999999997
soot so tiresome it was kind of way

2374.55 --> 2379.1400000000003
anyway was so just super meta and just

2377.28 --> 2382.6800000000003
kept on going and going and going and

2379.14 --> 2384.96
going and going going oh I hope they

2382.68 --> 2386.58
don't do that today because it's it's

2384.96 --> 2392.07
not a lot of fun sitting through that

2386.58 --> 2395.43
I'd rather yeah well it does get a bit

2392.07 --> 2399.54
boring Amanda you know I agree it like

2395.43 --> 2402.4199999999996
it was interesting to figure out what

2399.54 --> 2408.92
they were doing but it went on for so

2402.42 --> 2408.92
long and that just it was too long

2419.93 --> 2429.3089999999997
mm-hmm oh and by the way did you see

2422.75 --> 2433.46
rumpus over on rent ease yeah oh my god

2429.309 --> 2438.8900000000003
it's an hour or was it even more

2433.46 --> 2442.2200000000003
it was so long all that rumpus and he

2438.89 --> 2444.2
had a blast you could like the funny

2442.22 --> 2445.39
thing about it is I didn't really watch

2444.2 --> 2449.39
it

2445.39 --> 2451.5789999999997
he got roasted well I didn't I just saw

2449.39 --> 2454.339
the presentation parts I didn't see him

2451.579 --> 2456.8590000000004
interact with anyone afterwards got

2454.339 --> 2460.069
distracted also watched a movie it's

2456.859 --> 2462.14
part of the distraction but just he went

2460.069 --> 2463.819
on with that presentation for so long

2462.14 --> 2466.279
but I could hear every time it clicked

2463.819 --> 2468.38
in it's just like he seems to be having

2466.279 --> 2471.92
a great time he was like loving doing

2468.38 --> 2475.789
his presentation he really likes doing

2471.92 --> 2478.579
that so that was funny it was funny to

2475.789 --> 2481.1800000000003
feel that but yeah I got distracted so I

2478.579 --> 2485.059
didn't watch any actual back-and-forth

2481.18 --> 2485.5099999999998
and he kicked him because he rumpus too

2485.059 --> 2490.279
much

2485.51 --> 2494.1800000000003
I bet rumpus has been extremely around

2490.279 --> 2499.849
Pasir as of late so nothing is real

2494.18 --> 2508.52
really said that yep it can be special

2499.849 --> 2510.52
like that right anyway I saw a movie

2508.52 --> 2512.9
yesterday I think I saw it once before

2510.52 --> 2513.17
when I was either really drunk at the

2512.9 --> 2516.619
time

2513.17 --> 2520.819
or distracted or got hung up on that on

2516.619 --> 2524.599
the boring parts but I saw the movies

2520.819 --> 2531.92
it's not too old with Clash of the

2524.599 --> 2536.9300000000003
Titans and about basically Greek

2531.92 --> 2538.549
mythology gods and I thought well I got

2536.93 --> 2542.839
a good look this time and I thought it

2538.549 --> 2545.39
was really impressive how they did it

2542.839 --> 2547.549
and the weird thing was you could see

2545.39 --> 2548.99
that sometimes the CGI quality was

2547.549 --> 2552.73
lacking here and there they had a bit of

2548.99 --> 2552.7299999999996
trouble especially with landscaping

2553.119 --> 2558.9500000000003
transition actual physical things that

2556.46 --> 2560.51
the actors would be walking over and CGI

2558.95 --> 2563.45
background they had trouble with that

2560.51 --> 2566.869
there was noticeable for me but at

2563.45 --> 2570.5
beyond that the way they represented the

2566.869 --> 2572.27
gods like Eden and basically the in the

2570.5 --> 2580.839
higher dimension in the heavens tell us

2572.27 --> 2580.839
so wow I was just so impressed by that

2581.74 --> 2591.3489999999997
yeah but the movie was pretty good but

2585.349 --> 2595.19
it also had just parts that that were

2591.349 --> 2600.65
kind of boring I don't know it's like

2595.19 --> 2602.75
for some reason it seemed like the movie

2600.65 --> 2605.21
lacked the actors lacked a bit of

2602.75 --> 2608.9
emotion sometimes there was it wasn't

2605.21 --> 2610.579
deep enough maybe that's it I still had

2608.9 --> 2612.02
a lot of sympathy especially for the

2610.579 --> 2613.849
main character I thought he was a really

2612.02 --> 2618.53
cool guy you know

2613.849 --> 2621.65
Perseus but and sympathetic for his

2618.53 --> 2624.4100000000003
personal issues and like I thought he

2621.65 --> 2627.349
was likable but overall the yeah there

2624.41 --> 2629.8999999999996
are a lot of tragical issues happening a

2627.349 --> 2632.0
lot of them but it seems like it they

2629.9 --> 2635.869
all carried very little emotional weight

2632.0 --> 2638.0
to everyone nobody broke down ever

2635.869 --> 2644.1800000000003
crying from the horror of it all and

2638.0 --> 2647.68
that should damn well happen but I still

2644.18 --> 2651.6189999999997
thought it was a very cool movie

2647.68 --> 2655.0989999999997
yeah because just some of the visuals

2651.619 --> 2657.38
were just so impressive just how they

2655.099 --> 2662.26
present the gods was just it seemed

2657.38 --> 2662.26
worthy in a way and it's tough to do

2663.909 --> 2669.819
right so I watch that I got distracted

2666.919 --> 2672.589
because we also watch own Benjamin a

2669.819 --> 2673.759
little music day and was cool

2672.589 --> 2675.38
it's good sitting there in the

2673.759 --> 2676.449
background I can't comment more anymore

2675.38 --> 2679.429
these days because he doesn't

2676.449 --> 2684.649
members-only chat it's still good to

2679.429 --> 2686.2090000000003
listen to and yeah left to film kind of

2684.649 --> 2687.739
skipping him these days because it just

2686.209 --> 2692.1189999999997
talks about the coronavirus the

2687.739 --> 2695.599
coronavirus turn of it so yeah not that

2692.119 --> 2697.2490000000003
interested in it even though it's good

2695.599 --> 2699.529
to look every now and then because he

2697.249 --> 2703.249
does do deep research he does dig for

2699.529 --> 2706.309
like medical research details and such

2703.249 --> 2708.64
and that is a little interesting it's it

2706.309 --> 2711.469
because for me it is really interesting

2708.64 --> 2713.479
from a skeptical perspective from a

2711.469 --> 2716.449
german new medicine perspective as to

2713.479 --> 2719.359
what it is they're doing

2716.449 --> 2723.409
how they drew the conclusions for for it

2719.359 --> 2725.659
all to work from what they're doing I'm

2723.409 --> 2731.179
trying to figure out how the trick works

2725.659 --> 2735.4990000000003
really and it is a super every complex

2731.179 --> 2740.4790000000003
trick I think it is wizardry that is

2735.499 --> 2743.6589999999997
just very tough very deep-seated the

2740.479 --> 2746.6589999999997
medical system and in the bacterial

2743.659 --> 2750.7290000000003
theory that concept and viruses so I'm

2746.659 --> 2754.099
still I'm trying to very carefully

2750.729 --> 2757.0389999999998
gradually figure out the trick you could

2754.099 --> 2760.759
say in order so that I can explain it

2757.039 --> 2761.179
better anyway I'm gonna round up the

2760.759 --> 2764.809
show

2761.179 --> 2767.989
sorry for being so late it's a little

2764.809 --> 2771.409
short show because of that but yeah I'll

2767.989 --> 2773.4990000000003
try to be on time tomorrow hopefully

2771.409 --> 2777.109
