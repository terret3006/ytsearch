Amsterdam time I got up but the edits

124.92 --> 136.019
also because I had a very late night

127.5 --> 141.0
it's just yesterday was so active I just

136.019 --> 141.989
kept on kept up and kept on going it was

on behind me that's true but I don't

156.0 --> 163.13
have it on because I am sick just

159.15 --> 166.26000000000002
because I don't like the cold and the

163.13 --> 169.29
he-yeah the central heating isn't really

166.26 --> 171.32899999999998
doing all that much yet but I hope

169.29 --> 172.739
that's not gonna persist otherwise

171.329 --> 176.16
you're gonna have to complain to the

172.739 --> 178.109
landlord again that the ear is not doing

176.16 --> 184.41
its proper job but anyway I got the

178.109 --> 186.81
thing as a backup so my last remnant of

184.41 --> 188.43
my regular coffee and didn't even get to

186.81 --> 190.67000000000002
the Tamera coffee because this is still

188.43 --> 196.68
my first car today

190.67 --> 201.82899999999998
yeah just managed to get some tea still

196.68 --> 201.829
so yeah I really hurried it all up

[Music]

210.66 --> 217.21
yeah well dark man up all night might be

214.54 --> 220.69
a bad routine but I've had so much

217.21 --> 223.09
activity yesterday come on yesterday's

220.69 --> 229.84
been one of my most active YouTube days

223.09 --> 233.05
in they all since the summer yeah and

229.84 --> 249.31
it's not summer over here dude it's it's

233.05 --> 251.65
October it's not summer anyway let's get

249.31 --> 257.2
through chat before it becomes too big

251.65 --> 261.22
to oversee so don't take any wooden

305.93 --> 319.73
Jeffrey bill right yeah I think I got

310.58 --> 323.3
you all so good morning sorry if I seem

319.73 --> 325.97
a little slow cuz yeah

323.3 --> 327.77000000000004
this night shifted me a bit I got a

325.97 --> 329.90000000000003
shift back though because tomorrow I

327.77 --> 331.88
have to be somewhere at 12 o'clock so I

329.9 --> 335.12
can't do that I'm gonna put my alarm

331.88 --> 336.96999999999997
clock back on make sure I don't go to

335.12 --> 342.11
bed too late

336.97 --> 351.8
hmm but yeah yesterday to our early bird

342.11 --> 355.55
show after that and I do oh yeah I did

351.8 --> 358.7
my premiere of the and it went pretty

355.55 --> 360.92
successful I thought I I didn't really

358.7 --> 362.96
know how to announce it it was weird I

360.92 --> 365.75
want like I uploaded it then it's like

362.96 --> 368.91999999999996
premiere and I was like okay can I

365.75 --> 372.71
premiere I didn't perhaps say 30 minutes

368.92 --> 378.14000000000004
no it was just no soon as you click the

372.71 --> 380.51
button it's gonna premiere okay so yeah

378.14 --> 383.65999999999997
I didn't I wasn't able to widely

380.51 --> 387.38
announce it but anyway I cut that that

383.66 --> 389.6
episode of Jose is down where I was

387.38 --> 394.45
performing up against 13 ballers

389.6 --> 398.6
considering their claim a failure of the

394.45 --> 402.49
moon' radio signal rebounds phenomena

398.6 --> 406.91
and in one hour and seven minutes they

402.49 --> 409.88
managed to basically bypass delivering

406.91 --> 412.22
the proof still claiming it exists that

409.88 --> 414.86
it can be done and then put all the

412.22 --> 416.72
burden of their claim unto me by telling

414.86 --> 418.94
me my god are when you're so lazy why

416.72 --> 422.95000000000005
don't you go up to these people and then

418.94 --> 427.52
get the proof it it's super typical and

422.95 --> 430.43
I think I put it down I let that part

427.52 --> 432.08
come across perfectly so very satisfied

430.43 --> 434.78000000000003
about it

432.08 --> 436.06899999999996
yeah it was good to let just let it

434.78 --> 439.909
premiere because then I could focus

436.069 --> 441.949
purely on Chad and after that it me

439.909 --> 444.349
pretty much immediately went on to the

441.949 --> 447.819
ball busters panel live ball busters

444.349 --> 452.93
panel and that was awesome as well I

447.819 --> 454.759
thought I had a lot of fun there yeah I

452.93 --> 461.21
also had a bit of red wine so that

454.759 --> 464.91900000000004
helped and even after the show the after

461.21 --> 467.98999999999995
show was long it's very long we had

464.919 --> 472.039
pillbox on then and became very very

467.99 --> 476.3
messy so you're probably gonna see that

472.039 --> 477.289
as soon as that premiere it was crazy it

476.3 --> 480.56
went crazy

477.289 --> 483.229
but even then after the after-show stop

480.56 --> 488.69
we just kept on going for like another

483.229 --> 492.59
two hours so yeah deep after midnight I

488.69 --> 497.719
was still life on skype talking to the

492.59 --> 500.15
guys and there was just so much energy

497.719 --> 502.37
couldn't get away and after that I was

500.15 --> 509.69
still like buzzing around for three

502.37 --> 511.969
hours so that's why yes stars egg does

509.69 --> 515.269
bounce signal for a moon is old news

511.969 --> 517.459
yeah well the thing is news I still have

515.269 --> 520.789
it I've seen a lot of writings about it

517.459 --> 524.1199999999999
a lot of explanations and all super-wide

520.789 --> 525.62
references to data and [ __ ] but I've

524.12 --> 529.55
never actually seen somebody

525.62 --> 531.23
interactively do that on camera and that

529.55 --> 532.31
should be very easy right because

531.23 --> 534.5600000000001
everybody can do it

532.31 --> 536.0
everybody can do it you just have to

534.56 --> 537.8199999999999
have these equipment all these people

536.0 --> 540.38
with the equipment

537.82 --> 543.23
supposedly filming that saying Oh like

540.38 --> 546.47
look it is bouncing of the moon see the

543.23 --> 548.69
signal but the thing is they don't

546.47 --> 549.98
actually show where it's even pointing

548.69 --> 553.6600000000001
out that it's even pointing at the moon

549.98 --> 556.16
they don't vary the direction - actually

553.66 --> 558.17
yeah to actually make it into an

556.16 --> 560.36
experiment showing that it is pointing

558.17 --> 563.029
at the moon versus not at the moon

560.36 --> 565.52
none of the videos they presented to me

563.029 --> 567.23
and unfortunately they weren't presented

565.52 --> 568.88
the actual show themselves I just took a

567.23 --> 571.1
look at them although I did put them out

568.88 --> 572.51
in the chat at Jose so you should be

571.1 --> 578.36
able to pick that up if you look

572.51 --> 581.84
carefully in the premiere but yeah none

578.36 --> 590.99
of them did that so you can call it old

581.84 --> 596.36
news but yeah actual I don't know

590.99 --> 598.82
empirical interactive video proof up to

596.36 --> 600.92
a high standard would actually support

598.82 --> 602.32
that there is a phenomenon in the first

600.92 --> 606.4599999999999
place

602.32 --> 608.8100000000001
replacing 80 years worth talk and

606.46 --> 612.08
spreading rumors about this supposed

608.81 --> 616.4
moon signal phenomena rebounds phenomena

612.08 --> 620.8100000000001
that radio people can prove yet never

616.4 --> 622.88
seen it so does this trick work that you

620.81 --> 624.92
know it could turn out to be that they

622.88 --> 628.13
are actually kind of through secret

624.92 --> 629.78
societies obligated to fake it and then

628.13 --> 631.9399999999999
that's why we don't see any video that

629.78 --> 636.1999999999999
it's even that bad that there literally

631.94 --> 638.21
is no signal vans phenomena that is that

636.2 --> 640.37
is real that is significant to a

638.21 --> 642.44
supposed moon surface that it just

640.37 --> 645.32
always bounces back and they just fool

642.44 --> 647.3000000000001
around with it so that then the trick

645.32 --> 650.99
would become a machination just to show

647.3 --> 652.91
who is so technical we are doing what we

650.99 --> 656.45
say we are doing because we have a very

652.91 --> 659.75
complicated setup and that might fool

656.45 --> 662.99
people that are slightly intimidated by

659.75 --> 668.84
technicalities that would then go to

662.99 --> 671.96
these people for a demonstration so yeah

668.84 --> 674.1800000000001
as I even supposed during the interview

671.96 --> 677.33
look at some point I might just take a

674.18 --> 679.0999999999999
couple of guys with me and actually do

677.33 --> 682.46
what they say they're good though go to

679.1 --> 684.49
the radio Club and then wait for them to

682.46 --> 686.4200000000001
prepare for like probably two months

684.49 --> 688.67
because they have to prepare that

686.42 --> 692.03
carefully machination is not easily

688.67 --> 693.8199999999999
prepared and then expect us to just go

692.03 --> 697.4399999999999
along with their program and

693.82 --> 701.85
except the proof exactly as the day as

697.44 --> 704.2
they give it and then I will test it and

701.85 --> 706.36
then we will get into fights and

704.2 --> 707.95
probably kicked out because I will

706.36 --> 710.6800000000001
immediately start pointing out the

707.95 --> 713.4000000000001
things that they are not actually that

710.68 --> 716.05
they're actually just covering up and

713.4 --> 720.64
the standards they're not upholding that

716.05 --> 727.1099999999999
they should to present viable proof and

720.64 --> 727.11
so I know that's gonna happen I know it

727.62 --> 733.15
so to spare myself the trouble because

730.81 --> 736.15
it's not gonna eventually deliver proof

733.15 --> 738.61
just get more anger and like oh yeah see

736.15 --> 740.7099999999999
or who we've mucked it up or we mucked

738.61 --> 744.25
it up you got it into a fight or

740.71 --> 747.13
deliberately to prevent the proof yeah

744.25 --> 749.86
that's what everyone all the [ __ ]

747.13 --> 754.56
trolls in here they will all say it they

749.86 --> 754.5600000000001
were all gush it once that happens and

755.07 --> 762.82
that's why they don't deliver the proof

760.21 --> 765.73
themselves that's why they leave it to

762.82 --> 768.5200000000001
me to lose your win what I want or we

765.73 --> 770.52
just get to proof the proof of their

768.52 --> 776.31
claim that they've been making for years

770.52 --> 779.1999999999999
and that's exactly why they do that so I

776.31 --> 784.3
know what they're doing they are a bunch

779.2 --> 787.4200000000001
of sneaky wizards and they don't care if

784.3 --> 789.76
they sneaky as long as in their

787.42 --> 791.9799999999999
subconscious in their feelin world

789.76 --> 797.23
that's not rational as long as they feel

791.98 --> 800.94
that their thing has won somehow and one

797.23 --> 803.1700000000001
could be it escaped without damage

800.94 --> 806.47
that's good enough for them they don't

803.17 --> 808.6899999999999
care how nasty the deception they are

806.47 --> 810.58
making they're fabricating as part of

808.69 --> 813.0100000000001
themselves even far they don't care

810.58 --> 816.34
really in the subconscious they don't

813.01 --> 821.35
care they'll go any length to just mock

816.34 --> 823.499
it up to just prevent the truth from

821.35 --> 832.059
seeing the light of day

823.499 --> 834.6
I'm pretty sure they will anyway here I

832.059 --> 837.249
yeah it's always me you know I

834.6 --> 840.879
eventually always fall from fall for it

837.249 --> 844.059
because I don't settle for mock-ups I

840.879 --> 846.66
don't settle for no for winning by

844.059 --> 849.399
default because the person continually

846.66 --> 851.9789999999999
making the claim doesn't back up his

849.399 --> 855.1
claim I know that's a technical win but

851.979 --> 858.029
the problem is that doesn't satisfy me

855.1 --> 861.519
so I will eventually always basically

858.029 --> 863.769
take their baits just because I want

861.519 --> 868.389
some progress whatsoever I don't give a

863.769 --> 871.839
[ __ ] about their mind structures that

868.389 --> 875.289
that they build a mental trap that only

871.839 --> 877.839
works on them really to make me do

875.289 --> 880.569
things to put me into a situation that

877.839 --> 882.0390000000001
they predicts it's very predictable

880.569 --> 883.2389999999999
because of the attitudes because of what

882.039 --> 886.419
they know they're doing and what they

883.239 --> 889.479
keep back and then I'll stumble and then

886.419 --> 892.209
they can in their minds blame me for not

889.479 --> 895.149
doing it right for not working alone for

892.209 --> 898.899
maybe even on purpose trying to mock it

895.149 --> 901.079
up blame it on me the mock-up that I

898.899 --> 904.269
prevented the evidence because I

901.079 --> 906.069
supposedly knew oh my god see it's real

904.269 --> 908.35
because it is the bow and because I'm a

906.069 --> 910.659
flat earther and flat earthers are of

908.35 --> 912.339
course all disingenuous and dishonest

910.659 --> 914.949
because we are a flat earther that's

912.339 --> 916.9290000000001
what ballers really think on top of

914.949 --> 918.399
their when they get going you know not

916.929 --> 920.289
when you face them then they realize

918.399 --> 922.569
it's [ __ ] but when they're among one

920.289 --> 925.329
another they're very easily lying about

922.569 --> 928.329
this [ __ ] so they just say look see he

925.329 --> 931.419
saw the proof which means the earth is a

928.329 --> 934.289
ball so he must therefore deny it was

931.419 --> 936.85
real so Arwen is gonna mock it up

934.289 --> 940.659
because he's flat earther and he says

936.85 --> 942.899
disingenuous see this is proof we were

940.659 --> 946.479
right even though they haven't actually

942.899 --> 950.38
themselves confirmed visually the

946.479 --> 954.73
evidence that's where they'll go

950.38 --> 960.61
you know I am right you know it guys and

954.73 --> 961.45
gals you know it right press 1 if you

960.61 --> 965.64
think I'm right

961.45 --> 965.6400000000001
and for a cero if you think I'm wrong

975.08 --> 978.659
[Music]

986.3 --> 990.319
no sir checkers cans

999.0 --> 1001.81
indeed

1003.12 --> 1009.39
yeah yeah : dresser it seems pretty

1006.97 --> 1009.39
persistent

1013.11 --> 1018.72
now that's the thing in general the real

1015.6 --> 1021.72
ballers the ones that that can't let it

1018.72 --> 1024.63
go and then even hang around here you

1021.72 --> 1030.9
know for whatever reason they can't

1024.63 --> 1034.95
prioritize bigger insights over if that

1030.9 --> 1038.3100000000002
means that their belief is less

1034.95 --> 1043.26
strengthened because of it so they'll

1038.31 --> 1046.85
choose the ball over anything that's

1043.26 --> 1046.85
what that was kind of the test here

1056.36 --> 1062.52
now bandsaw bandit I the one end the

1059.52 --> 1066.06
zero is very obvious it is a binary is

1062.52 --> 1068.4
simple one do you think it's correct

1066.06 --> 1070.8
zero do you think it's not correct and

1068.4 --> 1074.25
that can mean all kinds of other things

1070.8 --> 1077.06
not it's the know so it is a full

1074.25 --> 1077.06
spectrum choice

1090.61 --> 1101.03
what do I mean choose the ball over

1093.17 --> 1105.8600000000001
anything well it's very simple if any

1101.03 --> 1111.41
kind of choice system Direction opinion

1105.86 --> 1116.27
or whatever if one of the options of the

1111.41 --> 1119.3600000000001
dichotomy presented shows the globe

1116.27 --> 1122.27
earth to be in doubt in relation to the

1119.36 --> 1125.09
other you will always choose the one

1122.27 --> 1129.74
that does not bring it in doubt every

1125.09 --> 1132.7099999999998
time that's what I mean it's it's the

1129.74 --> 1133.85
ball option is prioritized above

1132.71 --> 1136.52
anything else

1133.85 --> 1140.9299999999998
it's like a parade political

1136.52 --> 1144.29
prioritization you can't afford not to

1140.93 --> 1146.5900000000001
that kind of thing it's instinctive

1144.29 --> 1146.59
really

1164.09 --> 1166.6899999999998
yeah

1171.49 --> 1178.7
SCD iran tea is my number one troll

1175.909 --> 1181.0100000000002
really I don't know

1178.7 --> 1182.929
ceejai Randi may have started out as a

1181.01 --> 1185.59
troll but I think he's just a regular

1182.929 --> 1185.5900000000001
guy really

1208.58 --> 1217.61
I know I know Ratner Stefan elderson so

1213.29 --> 1219.4099999999999
keep on dreaming but yeah that's what

1217.61 --> 1221.33
you're dreaming about you know if you

1219.41 --> 1225.5900000000001
want to keep up dreaming about that then

1221.33 --> 1227.78
there's no point even being part of the

1225.59 --> 1233.6599999999999
conversation unless you want to use that

1227.78 --> 1236.24
dream to distract from it but yeah we

1233.66 --> 1238.97
were actually dealing in figuring out

1236.24 --> 1243.35
the phenomena of this world whether they

1238.97 --> 1246.77
be real or not and I'm taking that

1243.35 --> 1251.03
serious I'm really trying to take the

1246.77 --> 1255.68
whole thing scientific one piece at a

1251.03 --> 1258.08
time just figure out if there is

1255.68 --> 1260.0900000000001
anything to these claims because look at

1258.08 --> 1263.57
the same time all these globe

1260.09 --> 1267.55
machinations everywhere that are taken

1263.57 --> 1271.07
up made part of the society and the

1267.55 --> 1277.1599999999999
control through radio and all that those

1271.07 --> 1281.21
societies they could have stumbled at

1277.16 --> 1283.6100000000001
some point on a real phenomenon and that

1281.21 --> 1286.94
what just happened to be very convenient

1283.61 --> 1288.4099999999999
when you start to assume or when you

1286.94 --> 1292.0700000000002
want to assume that the moon is a

1288.41 --> 1295.5500000000002
physical object so I never said that the

1292.07 --> 1297.6499999999999
phenomena could not be real it might be

1295.55 --> 1299.96
it just doesn't necessarily mean that

1297.65 --> 1302.63
the moon is a physical object it just

1299.96 --> 1305.27
means that a signal may be bounced back

1302.63 --> 1308.45
somehow when you want to point in them

1305.27 --> 1310.97
in the direct in the direction of the

1308.45 --> 1314.66
where the moonlight is coming from in

1310.97 --> 1316.9
relation to the location so there may be

1314.66 --> 1320.8100000000002
a phenomena there and it's interesting

1316.9 --> 1327.46
curious in discovering and figuring out

1320.81 --> 1327.46
phenomenon so that's how I see it

1327.89 --> 1336.8700000000001
but it's the the ballers myth about the

1332.49 --> 1339.33
moon radio signal bounce phenomena that

1336.87 --> 1341.6399999999999
that exists that they just keep on

1339.33 --> 1344.4299999999998
upholding because while kind of like the

1341.64 --> 1347.1000000000001
Coriolis nan said it has to be there for

1344.43 --> 1350.94
them it's become part of their folklore

1347.1 --> 1353.55
of their story palette it's part of

1350.94 --> 1356.7
their their ball mythology they have it

1353.55 --> 1358.98
has to exist but despite that everybody

1356.7 --> 1361.65
believes in it and describes how and

1358.98 --> 1364.53
there's all these reports and papers and

1361.65 --> 1367.8300000000002
blah blah blah a lot of talk a lot of

1364.53 --> 1371.36
belief in it right I've just never seen

1367.83 --> 1376.47
a satisfactory experiment while even

1371.36 --> 1381.74
described it should be so damn easy to

1376.47 --> 1384.99
do so why in the age of mobile

1381.74 --> 1388.59
multimedia and everybody having webcams

1384.99 --> 1391.29
and and technical stuff being super

1388.59 --> 1394.23
cheap and mall module-based everything

1391.29 --> 1397.68
is easy why and that's been like this

1394.23 --> 1399.54
for 20 years now right 20 years ago was

1397.68 --> 1401.64
roughly the start of that technical

1399.54 --> 1407.36
revolution with the internet everything

1401.64 --> 1412.3400000000001
so why if this is the thing that's

1407.36 --> 1416.61
existed for like 60 years or more why

1412.34 --> 1420.27
aren't there like 20 videos that show

1416.61 --> 1425.07
exactly the setup that I present adjust

1420.27 --> 1427.47
to break the doubt bang it's there no

1425.07 --> 1430.3799999999999
it's not it's not there it's a bunch of

1427.47 --> 1432.72
mock-ups it's a bunch of setups and

1430.38 --> 1434.22
nothing has changed it's just a claim

1432.72 --> 1438.6000000000001
being made you don't even get to see

1434.22 --> 1440.46
where anything is pointing at so that's

1438.6 --> 1445.1399999999999
the only thing that I've seen so far it

1440.46 --> 1448.29
just is highly disappointing and just

1445.14 --> 1452.8100000000002
almost seems sloppy

1448.29 --> 1452.81
it seems very sloppy to me

1453.129 --> 1459.379
unless of course it really is a

1456.249 --> 1463.249
hundred-percent myth that they just have

1459.379 --> 1465.9189999999999
to conjure up out of nothing for people

1463.249 --> 1468.3790000000001
to believe in in that case that would

1465.919 --> 1470.5990000000002
explain more it would be kind of

1468.379 --> 1472.2489999999998
saddening you know it's not fun when you

1470.599 --> 1476.389
find out that a phenomena is just

1472.249 --> 1479.289
complete fiction but yeah I'm not there

1476.389 --> 1481.6689999999999
yet I still want to see it test it and

1479.289 --> 1484.279
we'll see what it is whether it the

1481.669 --> 1486.529
phenomena is real or not we'll go from

1484.279 --> 1498.32
there on just like I explained on the

1486.529 --> 1505.969
premiere oh of course Daniel yeah what a

1498.32 --> 1509.6899999999998
dick I can't believe I let you talk me

1505.969 --> 1516.44
into an banning you you're such a dick

1509.69 --> 1521.559
these days disgusting so disingenuous so

1516.44 --> 1521.559
obsessed with your nonsense

1530.579 --> 1535.089
yeah James Collins how do I explain

1533.619 --> 1538.299
shadows on the moon's very simple

1535.089 --> 1541.9589999999998
they're not shadows they are apparent

1538.299 --> 1546.549
shadows because of the contrast they're

1541.959 --> 1548.199
not shadows though you don't have proof

1546.549 --> 1550.179
that they're shadows they're just a

1548.199 --> 1552.3690000000001
light contrast because everything you

1550.179 --> 1556.959
get to see from the moon is like a

1552.369 --> 1562.359
fractal it's like a it is very much like

1556.959 --> 1564.669
a mirror play of light and shadow in an

1562.359 --> 1566.289
interesting fractal like setup I wonder

1564.669 --> 1568.019
if it's something like it could be

1566.289 --> 1573.639
emulated where you could literally

1568.019 --> 1577.779
yourself just very very it very the

1573.639 --> 1579.7289999999998
light source that causes the that's the

1577.779 --> 1582.069
source of the apparent light effect in

1579.729 --> 1585.159
the first place within the fractal line

1582.069 --> 1586.839
set up and then show similar patterns to

1585.159 --> 1589.689
what we see in the moon phases it would

1586.839 --> 1592.509
be very interesting but I'm convinced

1589.689 --> 1595.1490000000001
that the moon is holographic still even

1592.509 --> 1598.779
the apparent shadows and the creators

1595.149 --> 1602.649
that are really not graters take a

1598.779 --> 1605.249
closer look up a closer look it it's not

1602.649 --> 1605.2489999999998
craters

1606.88 --> 1609.88
so

1612.03 --> 1623.59
mmm you need to take it easy there Colin

1618.49 --> 1627.13
dresser they're not shadows it's all

1623.59 --> 1629.7099999999998
light all of the moon is like and have

1627.13 --> 1632.92
you ever realized that even with the

1629.71 --> 1635.2
solar eclipse when the presupposed moon

1632.92 --> 1637.1200000000001
goes in front of the Sun right well

1635.2 --> 1640.8700000000001
there's like a circle of light

1637.12 --> 1643.1799999999998
well this circle of light is the pattern

1640.87 --> 1646.33
of the very light that is coming toward

1643.18 --> 1650.5900000000001
you and that's provable because you can

1646.33 --> 1654.1299999999999
refract it you can split it up and it'll

1650.59 --> 1656.59
show the circle pattern everywhere that

1654.13 --> 1658.5100000000002
is the very format of the light that is

1656.59 --> 1660.55
approaching you that is what it is and

1658.51 --> 1663.72
the same thing goes for the moonlight

1660.55 --> 1667.57
it's not just light that is being

1663.72 --> 1670.03
blocked off in the shadow parts no the

1667.57 --> 1672.85
very nature the very pattern of the

1670.03 --> 1676.45
light that is coming towards you is the

1672.85 --> 1679.81
entirety of the moon-shaped there's

1676.45 --> 1682.96
literally that pattern that you see of

1679.81 --> 1688.29
the moon that is the the nature of the

1682.96 --> 1688.29
light beams that are coming towards you

1688.56 --> 1694.27
it doesn't mean that it is being

1691.36 --> 1698.08
reflected off some physical object at

1694.27 --> 1701.41
all it is just the very nature of the

1698.08 --> 1704.47
pattern of the light of that celestial

1701.41 --> 1707.3200000000002
body that is coming towards you and if

1704.47 --> 1711.0
it looks a certain way in your eye or in

1707.32 --> 1714.6399999999999
the camera that just shows that is

1711.0 --> 1717.46
basically the the nature of the light

1714.64 --> 1719.88
beams that are coming towards you from

1717.46 --> 1719.88
that direction

1721.97 --> 1729.919
I tried to explain this to Anthony over

1726.409 --> 1730.72
Skype to he almost got it but it is a

1729.919 --> 1734.45
tough one

1730.72 --> 1737.809
it's just approaching things or lights

1734.45 --> 1740.21
and confirmed physical non-physical

1737.809 --> 1741.799
objects of things in the sky that we

1740.21 --> 1746.5900000000001
have not been able to confirm our

1741.799 --> 1746.59
physical in a in a proper empirical way

1747.279 --> 1755.899
all right well if you then go to the the

1753.5 --> 1758.57
next best guess namely that it is

1755.899 --> 1762.32
holographic in nature then you just get

1758.57 --> 1765.4089999999999
to look into how lights work how light

1762.32 --> 1768.83
beams work how they split up how they

1765.409 --> 1770.6290000000001
reflect what that is and then I just

1768.83 --> 1774.049
figure out yeah it is like it is the

1770.629 --> 1775.9399999999998
lamp the the light beams themselves the

1774.049 --> 1779.539
light beams that are coming from that

1775.94 --> 1782.8990000000001
celestial body themselves are literally

1779.539 --> 1786.4089999999999
a like a miniature light crystal every

1782.899 --> 1790.5189999999998
beam of it is a miniature version of the

1786.409 --> 1794.6000000000001
thing that you are seeing there like a

1790.519 --> 1800.96
stamp stamp of light just trying to

1794.6 --> 1804.879
compare it here that's what it is it's

1800.96 --> 1804.8790000000001
the pattern of the very beams themselves

1808.99 --> 1812.079
[Music]

1819.12 --> 1825.7199999999998
oh right Daniel sorry I didn't I read

1822.18 --> 1827.78
that wrong I guess still a little pissed

1825.72 --> 1833.91
off about your behaviour in chat

1827.78 --> 1836.04
yesterday but you're right

1833.91 --> 1838.5600000000002
look radio clubs don't give a [ __ ] about

1836.04 --> 1839.9099999999999
Flat Earth because if you're in a radio

1838.56 --> 1843.44
Club you're gonna be dealing with

1839.91 --> 1846.21
spinning balls and NASA stories all day

1843.44 --> 1849.3
long because that's what they do that's

1846.21 --> 1851.07
the club that's their culture they're

1849.3 --> 1855.62
the ones designated to uphold it that's

1851.07 --> 1860.1899999999998
why on the news radio shows television

1855.62 --> 1863.8799999999999
even news outlets on the Internet it's

1860.19 --> 1866.25
all filled with ball stuff that's the

1863.88 --> 1870.18
club so of course they don't like flat

1866.25 --> 1872.4
earthers if I'd approached them and said

1870.18 --> 1874.0800000000002
like yeah I don't believe the moon is a

1872.4 --> 1875.8500000000001
physical object and the earth is flat

1874.08 --> 1881.01
there's a good chance they'll just show

1875.85 --> 1883.04
me the door you know so let's not do

1881.01 --> 1883.04
that

1886.16 --> 1894.47
but yeah again that's just more mock-up

1889.88 --> 1897.17
the whole issue was the whole issue was

1894.47 --> 1898.73
in the first place that the ballers are

1897.17 --> 1902.39
the ones making the claim that there is

1898.73 --> 1904.76
a moon signal bounce phenomena in the

1902.39 --> 1907.13
first place it's their claim and they

1904.76 --> 1909.85
have to actually provide the evidence to

1907.13 --> 1912.0200000000002
satisfy that claim for everyone and

1909.85 --> 1914.57
they're not doing it now they're laying

1912.02 --> 1916.94
there migrating the burden of the claim

1914.57 --> 1919.85
to the people that are wanting to see

1916.94 --> 1925.79
the claim and that is just it's nasty

1919.85 --> 1932.53
it's disingenuous it's absolutely not

1925.79 --> 1935.3899999999999
scientific anyway so yeah that's it I

1932.53 --> 1938.27
can't say it enough I might be saying

1935.39 --> 1942.41
this on a daily basis now for the next

1938.27 --> 1945.3799999999999
month just just to show you it does not

1942.41 --> 1948.8600000000001
matter how long you try to evade this

1945.38 --> 1950.69
does not matter what you do what you

1948.86 --> 1954.26
convince yourself I will keep on

1950.69 --> 1956.81
reminding you that you need to provide

1954.26 --> 1959.62
evidence for that claim that specific

1956.81 --> 1962.51
phenomena claim that can be tested and

1959.62 --> 1965.33
that has been very elaborately detailed

1962.51 --> 1970.34
claim the claim has been very detailed

1965.33 --> 1973.1299999999999
so them demonstrated stop making the

1970.34 --> 1976.31
stupid stories about it and just show it

1973.13 --> 1980.72
you know just like this freakin Coriolis

1976.31 --> 1984.4099999999999
sniper [ __ ] all this freaking talk just

1980.72 --> 1986.93
show it stop talking about it and stop

1984.41 --> 1990.02
doing being disingenuous don't shoot

1986.93 --> 1993.1100000000001
only west and east don't be a freakin

1990.02 --> 1995.3
[ __ ] everybody knows that is the only

1993.11 --> 1996.9199999999998
way that even if you presuppose that

1995.3 --> 2000.09
it's there that it wouldn't do anything

1996.92 --> 2003.93
it's absolutely disingenuous to even

2000.09 --> 2007.57
attempt to prove coriolis that fashion

2003.93 --> 2010.93
all right why don't you just actually do

2007.57 --> 2013.6
it right and actually show the phenomena

2010.93 --> 2017.8600000000001
you're claiming stop being this

2013.6 --> 2019.879
disgusting story tellers just tell

2017.86 --> 2022.4289999999999
constant nonsense stories and

2019.879 --> 2024.889
don't provide the evidence for the claim

2022.429 --> 2028.209
that you make within the story that you

2024.889 --> 2031.4589999999998
keep on repeating sick of these people

2028.209 --> 2033.5890000000002
provide evidence for your claims you're

2031.459 --> 2038.229
the ones making the claims not the flat

2033.589 --> 2041.359
earthers we don't claim that phenomena

2038.229 --> 2043.699
we don't claim the coriolis happens on

2041.359 --> 2047.359
the earth because we assume it's

2043.699 --> 2048.23
stationary we've noticed empirically it

2047.359 --> 2051.319
is stationary

2048.23 --> 2053.569
we've drew the consequences of spinning

2051.319 --> 2056.0
versus being stationary and then figured

2053.569 --> 2058.429
out in the world what we do notice and

2056.0 --> 2060.829
what we don't and then we had to draw

2058.429 --> 2063.919
the conclusion it's stationary there is

2060.829 --> 2066.409
no Coriolis effect happening because of

2063.919 --> 2068.8689999999997
a presupposed spin or motion because the

2066.409 --> 2072.109
earth is stationary and the same goes

2068.869 --> 2073.819
for the freaking moon there is no

2072.109 --> 2077.179
evidence that the moon is a physical

2073.819 --> 2079.609
object in any way it looks however it

2077.179 --> 2082.789
looks there's no evidence it is physical

2079.609 --> 2086.899
but the ballers claim it is through

2082.789 --> 2089.75
radio signal bounces and presupposes the

2086.899 --> 2092.3289999999997
installation of [ __ ] and going to the

2089.75 --> 2094.22
moon and all that all to claim its

2092.329 --> 2095.69
physical and it's floating out there and

2094.22 --> 2097.91
you can bounce signals of it and

2095.69 --> 2100.819
everybody can do that so provide the

2097.91 --> 2105.6189999999997
evidence the actual evidence that there

2100.819 --> 2107.119
is a radio signal moon bounce phenomena

2105.619 --> 2109.25
that you can do that as claimed

2107.119 --> 2111.8900000000003
everybody could do with the proper radio

2109.25 --> 2114.41
well do it demonstrate it show it don't

2111.89 --> 2116.839
tell people to do it and then believe it

2114.41 --> 2119.24
now do it and do it on camera

2116.839 --> 2127.19
and show it that the phenomena you've

2119.24 --> 2129.529
been claiming for years now is real do

2127.19 --> 2132.2000000000003
it provide evidence for your claim and

2129.529 --> 2135.41
stop being such a disgusting stupid

2132.2 --> 2138.819
[ __ ] storytellers that make claims

2135.41 --> 2138.819
and don't provide the evidence

2140.68 --> 2146.14
if you're not going to provide the

2142.599 --> 2147.94
evidence then don't make the claims just

2146.14 --> 2151.72
stick the freaking science fiction

2147.94 --> 2153.91
stories that you can at least be honest

2151.72 --> 2157.299
about our science fiction stories and

2153.91 --> 2159.0989999999997
don't make claims that you're not going

2157.299 --> 2161.44
to provide any evidence for just blah

2159.099 --> 2165.039
blah blah blah blah or consensus where

2161.44 --> 2177.25
everybody believes or blah provide the

2165.039 --> 2178.9900000000002
evidence for your claims yeah well right

2177.25 --> 2181.27
darkstar well that's not really a

2178.99 --> 2185.2
problem that camera footage it can be

2181.27 --> 2187.15
faked you know why because a lot of flat

2185.2 --> 2191.529
earthers have even specialized in

2187.15 --> 2193.48
figuring out faked setups right they we

2191.529 --> 2195.339
deal with NASA and we caught them any

2193.48 --> 2198.4900000000002
all and I'm not me personally because

2195.339 --> 2200.589
it's it's not my specialty but I do like

2198.49 --> 2203.6499999999996
look along with others that do people

2200.589 --> 2205.96
like Jaron that keep a very close look

2203.65 --> 2206.799
upon footage put out by NASA and they

2205.96 --> 2209.799
figure it out

2206.799 --> 2211.63
well if you're gonna lit if anybody here

2209.799 --> 2215.349
is going to provide evidence for their

2211.63 --> 2219.299
claim and then completely fake it I'm

2215.349 --> 2222.6400000000003
gonna bet you it will be figured out and

2219.299 --> 2227.14
yeah once you actually knowingly put out

2222.64 --> 2229.48
a machine a machination a a tempered

2227.14 --> 2233.23
piece of evidence as a claim that's

2229.48 --> 2234.339
gonna be marked on you forever so a if

2233.23 --> 2237.069
that's worth the risk

2234.339 --> 2240.279
but it's much easier if just I don't

2237.069 --> 2242.95
know ten people especially ballers that

2240.279 --> 2245.14
have plenty of money if thousands

2242.95 --> 2247.48
dollars or yours or whatever to spend

2245.14 --> 2249.67
obviously because they are loaded with

2247.48 --> 2251.829
heavy equipment that they're showing off

2249.67 --> 2253.599
with constantly oh they're so happy with

2251.829 --> 2255.88
their life they have so much money well

2253.599 --> 2259.2400000000002
why don't you actually use some of that

2255.88 --> 2261.2200000000003
to actually provide the evidence for

2259.24 --> 2264.7599999999998
your claim and do it on mass do ten

2261.22 --> 2267.0389999999998
people and do it do it the setup that I

2264.76 --> 2268.599
suppose that I told you to do it

2267.039 --> 2271.3900000000003
shouldn't be that therefore it's not

2268.599 --> 2272.7400000000002
expensive it's not hard maybe it'll be a

2271.39 --> 2276.47
days where

2272.74 --> 2278.9599999999996
one time you know but look what you get

2276.47 --> 2281.5
if it actually works you have liked this

2278.96 --> 2285.14
very series scientifically viable

2281.5 --> 2287.45
experiment visually on camera that will

2285.14 --> 2290.6299999999997
actually provide evidence for the claim

2287.45 --> 2292.64
you've been making so that's totally

2290.63 --> 2295.04
worth it right it's your claim so it's

2292.64 --> 2297.44
actually doing for you just one days of

2295.04 --> 2300.56
work and that you need to actually do

2297.44 --> 2303.2000000000003
for you just so that you can be taken a

2300.56 --> 2305.48
little bit more seriously over the ages

2303.2 --> 2307.37
you know it's it's much better that if

2305.48 --> 2309.77
you're going to be making certain claims

2307.37 --> 2312.38
that you do provide some kind of

2309.77 --> 2315.91
evidence for it instead of just telling

2312.38 --> 2317.23
other people to do it or to Google it so

2315.91 --> 2319.52
do it

2317.23 --> 2322.28
there's a lot of guys on the baller side

2319.52 --> 2326.9
that have money do it do it exactly like

2322.28 --> 2332.17
I said you should you know that's the

2326.9 --> 2332.17
best way to do it so do it

2338.59 --> 2343.29
all right well SAP tapi that's very very

2342.16 --> 2347.52
nice

2343.29 --> 2350.38
everybody raise hundred dollars to prove

2347.52 --> 2351.34
there's an edge or a dome yeah well

2350.38 --> 2353.56
there we go

2351.34 --> 2355.63
nobody in Flat Earth is making that

2353.56 --> 2357.94
claim nobody that's actually Sears

2355.63 --> 2360.67
that's actually having channels at this

2357.94 --> 2364.36
point and it's not half a [ __ ] just

2360.67 --> 2366.34
mocking up everything people that can be

2364.36 --> 2369.4
considered flat earthers already know

2366.34 --> 2371.7400000000002
that there is no edge that that is a

2369.4 --> 2374.59
false dichotomy this is presupposing

2371.74 --> 2376.93
that there's a flat disk enveloped in

2374.59 --> 2379.51
outer space that's the edge concept and

2376.93 --> 2381.19
then there's the edge of the dome for

2379.51 --> 2384.5800000000004
the people that persist that the

2381.19 --> 2386.62
enclosure which must be present within

2384.58 --> 2388.77
the realm in order for the second law of

2386.62 --> 2393.1
thermodynamics to function properly

2388.77 --> 2397.09
right that it that must be a dome that

2393.1 --> 2401.17
must be half a half a globe that

2397.09 --> 2404.38
envelops us and that must sit with its

2401.17 --> 2407.32
edge in a circle on the physical world

2404.38 --> 2410.98
and I don't claim that and there's not a

2407.32 --> 2412.6600000000003
lot of people that claim that also

2410.98 --> 2415.7400000000002
because yeah it may not turn out to

2412.66 --> 2420.73
actually be the design of the realm as I

2415.74 --> 2423.58
explained it very elaborately so I don't

2420.73 --> 2425.56
need to make give any evidence that

2423.58 --> 2428.77
there is any edge because I'm not

2425.56 --> 2430.96
claiming it in the in the model whatever

2428.77 --> 2436.09
I don't claim there is an edge at this

2430.96 --> 2440.08
world where you can fall off I'm saying

2436.09 --> 2444.13
there is a land surface continuum and I

2440.08 --> 2448.62
and I presuppose in this case that the

2444.13 --> 2451.7200000000003
cause of that continual straight motion

2448.62 --> 2453.6099999999997
that continuum is because of a looping

2451.72 --> 2458.47
factor as part of the design of the

2453.61 --> 2461.5
realm that we are in that's yeah that's

2458.47 --> 2463.66
what I do and I've even said look

2461.5 --> 2466.15
there's ways you could basically figure

2463.66 --> 2468.43
out how that is the case and I'd love to

2466.15 --> 2471.15
do that one it's just very complex and

2468.43 --> 2471.1499999999996
besides

2473.369 --> 2477.579
still have to work on people actually

2475.799 --> 2479.68
understanding what I'm talking about

2477.579 --> 2481.539
first because yeah I can prove a lot it

2479.68 --> 2482.5789999999997
nobody gets what I'm even talking about

2481.539 --> 2487.44
this

2482.579 --> 2487.44
yeah not too useful

2491.96 --> 2497.7690000000002
[Music]

2493.2 --> 2500.0789999999997
well Lottie says I don't really have to

2497.769 --> 2503.14
because I already cleared up as a

2500.079 --> 2506.38
default that that claim that I made is

2503.14 --> 2510.67
basically presuppositional so I already

2506.38 --> 2512.829
said no it's a presupposition therefore

2510.67 --> 2515.859
not a real claim I'm not claiming that

2512.829 --> 2518.049
is absolute I'm just claiming it as an

2515.859 --> 2521.2
option as a possibility that could be

2518.049 --> 2525.4
figured out and that's not scientific

2521.2 --> 2531.66
evidence that's just my my view on what

2525.4 --> 2531.6600000000003
I think it probably is that's it

2536.03 --> 2547.13
why reckoner stuff conspiracy cats

2542.08 --> 2548.27
apologists to me on a second cello huh

2547.13 --> 2557.11
never heard of that

2548.27 --> 2557.11
apologize for what that's weird

2559.24 --> 2564.89
yeah well you can presuppose whatever

2562.13 --> 2567.04
you like lotty doesn't really matter to

2564.89 --> 2567.04
me

2567.28 --> 2585.1000000000004
my presuppositions are my own no sir

2583.82 --> 2588.59
check oh but that's the funny thing

2585.1 --> 2590.0
you're technically yours you think you

2588.59 --> 2592.79
got something but you're technically

2590.0 --> 2604.04
incorrect because a loop isn't infinite

2592.79 --> 2606.23
a loop cannot it a loop per definition

2604.04 --> 2612.2599999999998
is finite

2606.23 --> 2618.26
it's inherent to the concept there's no

2612.26 --> 2620.96
loop then you could assume infinities in

2618.26 --> 2622.7000000000003
some way there is a loop there is no

2620.96 --> 2625.06
infinity otherwise there would be no

2622.7 --> 2625.06
loop

2631.07 --> 2639.4500000000003
whatever Ragnar I don't really see the

2635.88 --> 2643.9500000000003
point I don't really see why he would

2639.45 --> 2646.62
have to apologize to me anyway oh and

2643.95 --> 2648.48
unless he said something really nasty

2646.62 --> 2649.29
about me on his channel but I didn't

2648.48 --> 2651.09
even take notice

2649.29 --> 2655.04
I don't follow a conspiracy cats you

2651.09 --> 2655.04
know it's just it does a lot of things

2657.71 --> 2663.77
but don't really dick

2668.41 --> 2675.519
I doubt it I don't think mark Sargeant

2671.95 --> 2679.8999999999996
claims a dome or an edge I think that

2675.519 --> 2683.8289999999997
he's cleared up in many ways that that

2679.9 --> 2685.7200000000003
is the way he prefers to look at the

2683.829 --> 2689.44
world that that he thinks that that is

2685.72 --> 2691.66
probably it's his presupposition and may

2689.44 --> 2693.73
not be as technical in his description

2691.66 --> 2695.8289999999997
of it but he's been trying to be very

2693.73 --> 2699.309
correct and elaborate and he does admit

2695.829 --> 2701.5190000000002
that it may turn out to be different he

2699.309 --> 2704.17
doesn't know it all he's been very

2701.519 --> 2707.4399999999996
direct about that and I appreciated

2704.17 --> 2711.4
about mark sergeant but yeah he does

2707.44 --> 2717.43
like his snow glow that's just the view

2711.4 --> 2720.6600000000003
oh really funny said something nasty

2717.43 --> 2723.3689999999997
about me surprise surprise that guy is

2720.66 --> 2726.8799999999997
disgusting and he has been for a very

2723.369 --> 2728.7400000000002
long time I don't give a [ __ ] what he is

2726.88 --> 2734.17
what he feels towards me he's a nasty

2728.74 --> 2743.2
figure and I don't care what he says at

2734.17 --> 2746.92
all no well so check Oh an endless loop

2743.2 --> 2749.41
and the loop is the same thing a loop

2746.92 --> 2752.17
doesn't end if especially if it's

2749.41 --> 2754.21
spacial in nature that's why it's a loop

2752.17 --> 2757.1800000000003
if you're going to move in one direction

2754.21 --> 2760.839
and end up in the same place then why

2757.18 --> 2763.5389999999998
would that ever stop if you kept on

2760.839 --> 2767.7889999999998
going see that doesn't make any sense no

2763.539 --> 2770.6800000000003
the loop makes the potential for motion

2767.789 --> 2774.13
infinite so in a looping space you could

2770.68 --> 2777.779
potentially if you managed to not

2774.13 --> 2781.539
disrupt everything in your path like go

2777.779 --> 2784.15
and Excel if you manage to for example

2781.539 --> 2786.5190000000002
accelerate imagine going to warp speed

2784.15 --> 2788.6800000000003
well technically in a loop looping

2786.519 --> 2795.1499999999996
spatial confined you could go warp speed

2788.68 --> 2795.1499999999996
and that bypass the loop like every

2795.21 --> 2800.079
1,000 second

2797.349 --> 2802.839
because they it is looping so no matter

2800.079 --> 2804.789
how fast you go the you will keep on

2802.839 --> 2807.519
going because the space itself is

2804.789 --> 2809.619
looping so that could be a technical

2807.519 --> 2811.5389999999998
person is not recommending anybody tried

2809.619 --> 2814.4790000000003
that it doesn't make any sense to do

2811.539 --> 2818.6800000000003
that but and could be dangerous you know

2814.479 --> 2820.7189999999996
you don't want to crash it lights B or

2818.68 --> 2822.6989999999996
whatever presuppose odd this is getting

2820.719 --> 2825.279
all science fictiony but yeah you don't

2822.699 --> 2827.619
want to have a super-high collision with

2825.279 --> 2833.229
the earth just to test out how fast you

2827.619 --> 2834.94
could go in the supposing confine but

2833.229 --> 2837.489
that is something that you could do with

2834.94 --> 2839.859
the loop because the space itself is

2837.489 --> 2842.259
still limited these amount of space is

2839.859 --> 2846.549
limited but it just continued its onto

2842.259 --> 2851.309
itself infinitely it continued it onto

2846.549 --> 2851.309
itself once so it can do that infinitely

2855.56 --> 2858.75
[Music]

2867.14 --> 2873.3289999999997
well I reckon Stefan how this and look

2870.15 --> 2875.569
there has I have looked around to see if

2873.329 --> 2878.46
I could get some interesting moon shots

2875.569 --> 2882.02
but it's just clouds it's been cloudy I

2878.46 --> 2882.02
haven't seen the moon since I came back

2894.41 --> 2897.5499999999997
[Music]

2898.72 --> 2904.8799999999997
all right well bandsaw bandit you can

2903.14 --> 2908.3599999999997
think you don't subscribe to the loop

2904.88 --> 2911.63
theory but the inevitable consequence of

2908.36 --> 2915.4700000000003
there not being a loop would be that

2911.63 --> 2920.54
there must must there's no other option

2915.47 --> 2925.6099999999997
there must be a barrier touching the

2920.54 --> 2927.41
earth and a the looping space a looping

2925.61 --> 2934.2200000000003
special confine is literally the only

2927.41 --> 2936.83
thing the only thing ever ever that

2934.22 --> 2943.79
content could potentially bypass that

2936.83 --> 2948.71
antecedent necessity and without that

2943.79 --> 2953.09
realization the globus will literally

2948.71 --> 2956.32
forever claim look there is no touching

2953.09 --> 2960.65
down of a dome or whatever kind of thing

2956.32 --> 2962.84
it must be a globe and just deny

2960.65 --> 2965.09
whatever limitation is up there where

2962.84 --> 2967.25
you can't get past or eventually you who

2965.09 --> 2969.44
knows they may even claim oh look the

2967.25 --> 2972.2
earth is a globe and we have like an a

2969.44 --> 2977.81
dome bill around this globe or cause

2972.2 --> 2980.62
aliens whatever but hey if there's

2977.81 --> 2985.7599999999998
nothing touching down about that

2980.62 --> 2988.1
platform that appears to be up there not

2985.76 --> 2992.6000000000004
a dome it seems more like a platform so

2988.1 --> 2994.43
far from everything I've gathered if

2992.6 --> 2998.81
it's not touching down anywhere they

2994.43 --> 3002.77
will the globus will forever for ever be

2998.81 --> 3004.48
able to retain onto this vague hope that

3002.77 --> 3009.07
it can be a globe because nothing is

3004.48 --> 3013.48
touching down ya realize this how that

3009.07 --> 3016.75
works so they'll keep on doing that

3013.48 --> 3019.57
unless we actually start to figure out

3016.75 --> 3021.73
what the more complex aspects of the

3019.57 --> 3025.54
realm are and that there indeed may be a

3021.73 --> 3028.87
looping factor indeed you can test it

3025.54 --> 3031.599
and I've already said look one of ways

3028.87 --> 3036.209
the test is have a very strong laser

3031.599 --> 3040.619
pointed exactly perpendicular to a

3036.209 --> 3043.3289999999997
presumed loop so east-west would be best

3040.619 --> 3046.509
maybe at the equator take sufficient

3043.329 --> 3049.2090000000003
Heights sufficient power and try to aim

3046.509 --> 3054.759
it in a way that the laser is gonna

3049.209 --> 3059.319
shoot past itself free supposing that it

3054.759 --> 3061.69
is flat and it's not an easy to assume

3059.319 --> 3063.219
that at this point but also that is

3061.69 --> 3065.65
looping that's not gonna hit some kind

3063.219 --> 3068.199
of dome or in it whatever it's not gonna

3065.65 --> 3071.349
reflect it's gonna go straight on and if

3068.199 --> 3074.92
it's looping that means it will keep on

3071.349 --> 3079.779
going until it has bypassed the entire

3074.92 --> 3083.89
loop and then it will start firing past

3079.779 --> 3086.859
the machine that is actually doing the

3083.89 --> 3091.209
firing and that is how you then kind of

3086.859 --> 3094.269
get very very strong evidence that there

3091.209 --> 3099.8489999999997
is a loop going on or unless you want to

3094.269 --> 3103.6499999999996
claim that lasers now loom 390 60

3099.849 --> 3108.67
degrees in a circle be fascinating claim

3103.65 --> 3112.049
or I don't know however else you want to

3108.67 --> 3115.42
try to deny that it would be especially

3112.049 --> 3117.339
limited kind of a confined realm that is

3115.42 --> 3119.799
looping in on itself I don't know how

3117.339 --> 3122.259
you would even do that at that point but

3119.799 --> 3127.059
that is kind of the thing that I had in

3122.259 --> 3129.489
mind that could be used to prove the

3127.059 --> 3131.88
spatially limited confined looping in on

3129.489 --> 3131.88
itself

3133.84 --> 3140.27
[Music]

3147.709 --> 3155.459
right Dark Star yes yes well the thing

3152.849 --> 3158.699
is you know with the super powerful

3155.459 --> 3161.0589999999997
laser it doesn't have to be powerful

3158.699 --> 3163.859
laser in the sense that it'll burn

3161.059 --> 3165.3590000000004
things away it's all about the type of

3163.859 --> 3168.479
energy you're going to be gathering so

3165.359 --> 3170.759
it doesn't have to be light energy in a

3168.479 --> 3174.39
spectrum that this could be destructive

3170.759 --> 3176.91
as long as it's just strong enough that

3174.39 --> 3180.299
it can bridge extreme distances that's

3176.91 --> 3183.5589999999997
basically it that it because the more

3180.299 --> 3186.869
light energy input you have in a laser

3183.559 --> 3189.989
yet the further it can penetrate because

3186.869 --> 3193.829
it does weaken down as it passes through

3189.989 --> 3196.559
material even air and water evaporation

3193.829 --> 3199.049
and the more it passes through the more

3196.559 --> 3203.4
it weakens the more that it just kind of

3199.049 --> 3206.729
gets absorbed and breaks off the the

3203.4 --> 3211.4390000000003
gather the yeah the large beam as it

3206.729 --> 3212.8089999999997
were so I don't think it has to be so

3211.439 --> 3216.089
strong that it would literally

3212.809 --> 3220.1090000000004
potentially burn in anything as long as

3216.089 --> 3221.999
it's just really a lot of the visible

3220.109 --> 3228.5989999999997
light entity I don't think it has to be

3221.999 --> 3231.709
damaging in nature it doesn't have to be

3228.599 --> 3231.7090000000003
like a Death Star laser

3239.59 --> 3244.2200000000003
[Music]

3242.19 --> 3244.2200000000003
ah

3248.74 --> 3253.4799999999996
Oh Ragnar Stefan Halverson why does it

3251.23 --> 3254.92
matter it's always the last question

3253.48 --> 3257.65
when everything else is broken right

3254.92 --> 3261.28
what does it matter because the truth

3257.65 --> 3263.859
matters and because there are things

3261.28 --> 3269.1400000000003
being lied about for reasons things are

3263.859 --> 3272.43
always lied about for reasons lies are

3269.14 --> 3275.08
pretty much never by coincidence unless

3272.43 --> 3276.3689999999997
it's on an individual basis there are

3275.08 --> 3279.22
some people that literally are

3276.369 --> 3282.4
pathological liars and you know them by

3279.22 --> 3285.8489999999997
their compulsion to basically push the

3282.4 --> 3287.8
lies so far unnecessarily because they

3285.849 --> 3289.9
kind of want to get caught at it that's

3287.8 --> 3293.8300000000004
a weird thing about real pathological

3289.9 --> 3296.6800000000003
liars for example Ellery Clinton is one

3293.83 --> 3299.02
of those she kinda can't help it she has

3296.68 --> 3300.94
to do say things that are so

3299.02 --> 3303.88
outrageously obviously wrong that it's

3300.94 --> 3307.3
you have to like on purpose that's

3303.88 --> 3311.32
pathological but lies in general are

3307.3 --> 3313.69
spun around the world to control people

3311.32 --> 3318.52
to steer people in a certain direction

3313.69 --> 3320.859
and people let it because the world is

3318.52 --> 3323.08
filled with these mechanisms so so to

3320.859 --> 3325.48
the individual it's they don't know the

3323.08 --> 3328.33
context necessarily of something a story

3325.48 --> 3332.38
a thing a picture they just go with

3328.33 --> 3335.5
their feelings so all this control

3332.38 --> 3337.75
system is being offered up freely for

3335.5 --> 3339.339
everybody to use and everybody's taking

3337.75 --> 3342.46
it because they don't get the big

3339.339 --> 3344.609
picture or they don't care or they just

3342.46 --> 3347.32
want to get somewhere no matter what

3344.609 --> 3351.52
that's how most of it works that's how

3347.32 --> 3354.79
the lies are woven into everything for a

3351.52 --> 3357.94
very complex purpose that the average

3354.79 --> 3359.74
person doesn't even get to get close to

3357.94 --> 3361.2400000000002
understanding or even one thing to

3359.74 --> 3362.9799999999996
understand because they're too

3361.24 --> 3366.66
preoccupied with their smaller things

3362.98 --> 3366.66
their earthly business

3369.5 --> 3381.869
so that's the reason why the lye control

3377.7 --> 3389.6299999999997
money steering things in the direction

3381.869 --> 3393.1400000000003
that you want and the monopolization of

3389.63 --> 3393.1400000000003
inside on truth

3398.55 --> 3405.28
yes Ragnar Stefan alderson yes you do

3401.82 --> 3407.92
there are advantages and disadvantages

3405.28 --> 3410.65
of knowing the earth is flat there

3407.92 --> 3413.53
definitely are the advantages is that

3410.65 --> 3415.9300000000003
you can actually start to unravel the

3413.53 --> 3419.01
lies as they have been woven through

3415.93 --> 3421.81
society you will be able to see

3419.01 --> 3424.2700000000004
undeniably so you can't suspend your own

3421.81 --> 3427.48
disbelief any more about it that it is

3424.27 --> 3429.97
very vastly woven into things seemingly

3427.48 --> 3434.32
innocent just as a kid story basically

3429.97 --> 3437.3199999999997
but that will change your view on how

3434.32 --> 3441.6090000000004
you see things and that will eventually

3437.32 --> 3443.44
then change you in how you conduct

3441.609 --> 3445.359
yourself an approach and forces you to

3443.44 --> 3447.79
make choices about how honest are you

3445.359 --> 3449.14
going to be how dedicated are you going

3447.79 --> 3450.13
to be or are you gonna keep more in the

3449.14 --> 3451.99
background about it

3450.13 --> 3453.79
because there are consequences that you

3451.99 --> 3455.7999999999997
will notice as soon as you get honest

3453.79 --> 3459.22
because all these lies that are kept in

3455.8 --> 3461.4300000000003
place are not just like soap bubbles

3459.22 --> 3465.04
that just burst and they're gone no

3461.43 --> 3467.6189999999997
every lie is being kept in place by the

3465.04 --> 3471.339
people using the lies and leaning on

3467.619 --> 3473.8900000000003
them so there's instinctual reflections

3471.339 --> 3476.95
every time somebody exposes one of the

3473.89 --> 3479.08
lies that people are generally using so

3476.95 --> 3482.7999999999997
there's an instinctive backlash every

3479.08 --> 3485.14
time like how dare you spread yeah how

3482.8 --> 3488.2000000000003
dare you make us doubt in the things

3485.14 --> 3491.859
that we rely upon that's that's the

3488.2 --> 3494.56
downside of of actually accepting the

3491.859 --> 3496.75
earth is flat you get a lot more

3494.56 --> 3498.58
friction but at least with whatever

3496.75 --> 3501.67
you're constructing in your mind you can

3498.58 --> 3503.95
actually get to the real things you can

3501.67 --> 3505.54
start to figure out real things and not

3503.95 --> 3507.9399999999996
keep on dwelling on science fiction

3505.54 --> 3510.16
presumptions that's the big difference

3507.94 --> 3512.8
you can actually use your brain and your

3510.16 --> 3515.7999999999997
technical mind for something that can

3512.8 --> 3517.3590000000004
actually be real that's the big

3515.8 --> 3521.349
difference and that's one of the most

3517.359 --> 3525.0099999999998
alluring parts for me because I want to

3521.349 --> 3527.19
I want to like figure out real

3525.01 --> 3531.0600000000004
technology things

3527.19 --> 3535.5
and just see what they covered up with

3531.06 --> 3537.68
the web of lies and there's already so

3535.5 --> 3540.12
much even outside of Flat Earth that

3537.68 --> 3542.25
hasn't dealt with that things like how

3540.12 --> 3546.66
Tesla's technology has basically been

3542.25 --> 3548.19
muffled away and alternative systems

3546.66 --> 3551.37
have been applied and that's just a

3548.19 --> 3555.09
historically had made an example okay

3551.37 --> 3556.56
this is an admitted example so it can

3555.09 --> 3558.42
you imagine if there is an admitted

3556.56 --> 3561.5299999999997
example that's even been popularized

3558.42 --> 3564.96
kind of in the in the common culture

3561.53 --> 3569.8100000000004
then just imagine all the lies that are

3564.96 --> 3573.09
still being kept in place and in secret

3569.81 --> 3573.98
how much there really might be it's just

3573.09 --> 3579.42
crazy

3573.98 --> 3581.97
so it seems completely futile if you

3579.42 --> 3584.79
want to understand the world for real to

3581.97 --> 3588.5699999999997
then lay the bar so low that you're not

3584.79 --> 3591.69
even gonna transit beyond believing in

3588.57 --> 3593.88
Santa Claus baby that is because that it

3591.69 --> 3596.19
to me is really what the globe earth is

3593.88 --> 3598.6800000000003
at this point it's like the Santa Claus

3596.19 --> 3600.96
story it's a very nice and appealing

3598.68 --> 3604.6499999999996
view and image and feeling and

3600.96 --> 3608.4
associations but it's so obviously not

3604.65 --> 3610.38
real it is such an act because as soon

3608.4 --> 3615.21
as you start taking anything technically

3610.38 --> 3618.2000000000003
serious about it for real you just dive

3615.21 --> 3620.25
into this bees nest of horrific

3618.2 --> 3623.3999999999996
manipulation behavior and just

3620.25 --> 3626.16
machinations and just psychological

3623.4 --> 3628.26
attack and then now this is not the case

3626.16 --> 3630.0899999999997
for Santa Claus you know with Santa

3628.26 --> 3632.07
Claus it's usually if once you do that

3630.09 --> 3634.53
it's just going to be kids crying being

3632.07 --> 3638.67
really disappointed but with the globe

3634.53 --> 3642.3500000000004
earth that's the response you get from a

3638.67 --> 3644.34
seemingly polite and civilized of

3642.35 --> 3646.64
civilization the globe we've gone so far

3644.34 --> 3650.07
so you start to test it release the most

3646.64 --> 3651.74
nastiest behavior is such a contrast

3650.07 --> 3654.9300000000003
with the image of being civilized

3651.74 --> 3659.29
science and all that it's so bizarre

3654.93 --> 3662.3399999999997
that reveals itself so many times

3659.29 --> 3662.34
isn't it

3666.02 --> 3669.139
[Music]

3670.92 --> 3678.28
right so Chico

3672.79 --> 3684.34
yeah I agree yeah

3678.28 --> 3688.6000000000004
look I I wasn't giving you like a setup

3684.34 --> 3693.9900000000002
that that was meant as an obstacle

3688.6 --> 3693.99
machination it was actually a genuinely

3694.14 --> 3699.46
design idea I really mean it

3697.42 --> 3704.26
I want to test it and you're right sir

3699.46 --> 3706.95
checkout it is doable that's that's why

3704.26 --> 3706.9500000000003
I proposed

3720.7 --> 3745.16
hmm yeah that was somewhat left overs

3732.68 --> 3756.0499999999997
from the night no it's just now no

3745.16 --> 3758.5699999999997
sneezing going on actually no it's just

3756.05 --> 3761.0
a look I have bronchitis and this is

3758.57 --> 3762.55
just the last face so it's not hurting

3761.0 --> 3765.77
anymore

3762.55 --> 3767.96
yeah it's not tense it's not raw it

3765.77 --> 3770.03
feels like it's all already restoring

3767.96 --> 3773.7400000000002
it's just that still all that mucus and

3770.03 --> 3780.0800000000004
stuff it tends to build up in night and

3773.74 --> 3782.3199999999997
yeah coughing up all that weed no not

3780.08 --> 3782.3199999999997
really

3784.54 --> 3792.59
no I do not go to the doctors I don't

3787.4 --> 3795.4900000000002
need to do anything with doctors there

3792.59 --> 3798.54
are waste of my time

3795.49 --> 3798.54
[Music]

3808.619 --> 3811.619
yeah

3846.819 --> 3850.24
while septa

3851.079 --> 3857.539
yuge actually but there's a large amount

3853.94 --> 3860.569
of genius flat-earthers I think that

3857.539 --> 3863.69
probably all geniuses that are actually

3860.569 --> 3867.47
geniuses and that are not caught in a

3863.69 --> 3870.529
web of emotional based illusions like

3867.47 --> 3874.4199999999996
that are not religiously for that again

3870.529 --> 3876.71
some way I think that all of them

3874.42 --> 3879.98
absolutely realized that the globe is

3876.71 --> 3884.089
nonsense and that at least the earth

3879.98 --> 3885.7690000000002
appears to be flat and they may not be

3884.089 --> 3890.15
interested in drawing any further

3885.769 --> 3893.4799999999996
conclusions from that but in my opinion

3890.15 --> 3896.569
a person cannot possibly be a real

3893.48 --> 3898.5190000000002
genius and and actually believe that

3896.569 --> 3909.259
there is scientific proof the earth is a

3898.519 --> 3912.549
globe couldn't be possible but then

3909.259 --> 3916.059
again what I think is actual genius is

3912.549 --> 3916.059
it's quite out there

3917.2 --> 3930.46
I don't know Darkstar ie I have my good

3924.19 --> 3933.88
moments but I don't think that would be

3930.46 --> 3937.95
considered genius at all on average or

3933.88 --> 3942.819
maybe it would look I don't I don't care

3937.95 --> 3945.549
I'm gonna be as smart as I can and the

3942.819 --> 3950.859
way I am doing that is by making sure

3945.549 --> 3954.549
that my mind stays trained and optimal

3950.859 --> 3957.2799999999997
and especially that I keep on learning

3954.549 --> 3960.25
and part of that learning process is

3957.28 --> 3963.3390000000004
that every time I catch myself on a

3960.25 --> 3967.119
mistake that a totally exposed that

3963.339 --> 3969.67
mistake and forced myself to learn from

3967.119 --> 3973.2400000000002
it whether it be voluntary or against my

3969.67 --> 3973.9
own will I refuse not to learn from my

3973.24 --> 3978.1299999999997
mistakes

3973.9 --> 3981.78
I must because that is the true way to

3978.13 --> 3986.44
progress lasting durable progress and I

3981.78 --> 3988.3590000000004
persist I insist that I progress with

3986.44 --> 3993.66
everything I'm doing the the mental

3988.359 --> 3993.66
process of it that's why I do that

4010.94 --> 4014.13
[Music]

4020.48 --> 4024.04
get out of here

4032.88 --> 4038.11
there's only one place where that

4035.32 --> 4044.26
happens Ragnar Stefan Alderson and that

4038.11 --> 4048.13
is in your dreams literally so yeah

4044.26 --> 4051.9100000000003
people can create their own sub or win

4048.13 --> 4054.82
in their mind why they imagine with

4051.91 --> 4056.74
grades relief everytime glorious moment

4054.82 --> 4058.98
where are when in their dream in their

4056.74 --> 4061.6899999999996
vision come stepping up to them damn I

4058.98 --> 4063.46
really thought I had it there with that

4061.69 --> 4067.48
flat earth would it turn out to be glow

4063.46 --> 4071.41
after all yeah yeah that's in your

4067.48 --> 4073.78
fantasy and I don't like to hear about

4071.41 --> 4078.19
that fantasy really it's because it's I

4073.78 --> 4083.1600000000003
find it degrading and insulting that you

4078.19 --> 4083.16
use me in such a fashion so don't

4109.969 --> 4118.7300000000005
but variable variable isn't anything

4113.449 --> 4120.949
variable that's ridiculous a variable is

4118.73 --> 4124.429999999999
part of a bigger construct there's no

4120.949 --> 4126.1089999999995
variables and besides that universe that

4124.43 --> 4128.4490000000005
you're claiming in the first place is

4126.109 --> 4132.08
already a giant presupposition of a

4128.449 --> 4134.69
seemingly eternal realm in which all

4132.08 --> 4141.04
these things are physically present and

4134.69 --> 4141.04
that's already a mistake a huge mistake

4147.71 --> 4152.3
all right Ben Saab ended exactly

4154.37 --> 4158.919

[Music]

4160.299 --> 4165.339
oh you you should see it you got to do

4164.589 --> 4169.42
it don't you

4165.339 --> 4171.43
you're such a neurotic [ __ ] that's

4169.42 --> 4174.339
fine it's so annoying you do it every

4171.43 --> 4174.9400000000005
time you you're a math holic and I just

4174.339 --> 4179.29
told you

4174.94 --> 4183.129999999999
variable is not a relevant concept it's

4179.29 --> 4184.87
not part variable in the universe it's

4183.13 --> 4188.2
not relevant why don't you call it

4184.87 --> 4193.5689999999995
phenomena why don't you just call it

4188.2 --> 4197.139999999999
phenomena because you can actually point

4193.569 --> 4201.31
at something potentially and say this is

4197.14 --> 4202.900000000001
a phenomena and yeah that could be

4201.31 --> 4208.330000000001
correct or incorrect but at least it

4202.9 --> 4210.759999999999
makes sense stop calling it a variable

4208.33 --> 4213.5199999999995
if variable ism is like a mathematical

4210.76 --> 4215.88
construct aspect has nothing to do with

4213.52 --> 4215.88
reality

4224.08 --> 4227.229
[Music]

4242.05 --> 4251.29
I wonder about that sometimes dark sir

4244.599 --> 4256.119000000001
but that was the original idea yeah no

4251.29 --> 4258.219
no variables are part of a mathematical

4256.119 --> 4261.3099999999995
construct it has no bearing on reality

4258.219 --> 4264.369
it's a tool to measure up in the Duce

4261.31 --> 4267.04
things is no bearing on reality you can

4264.369 --> 4269.11
point to anything in reality and say

4267.04 --> 4271.33
that's a variable because it is a

4269.11 --> 4274.449
conceptual construct it's a part of a

4271.33 --> 4277.15
concept it's not as in reality parts of

4274.449 --> 4279.669999999999
concepts are not in reality things that

4277.15 --> 4281.469
are real are in reality so if you point

4279.67 --> 4284.17
at something in reality and call it a

4281.469 --> 4287.2300000000005
phenomena and ask me its test phenomena

4284.17 --> 4292.27
understood that's that will be

4287.23 --> 4294.4
irrelevant variable something in there

4292.27 --> 4299.26
that's not a variable a variable is

4294.4 --> 4301.48
indeed a part of a scientific setup if

4299.26 --> 4304.659000000001
you're gonna make a claim about the

4301.48 --> 4308.5
cause and effect of a phenomena but I

4304.659 --> 4310.2699999999995
wasn't even really getting all that

4308.5 --> 4312.969
information from what you said because

4310.27 --> 4316.51
you didn't say is everything in the

4312.969 --> 4319.36
world that we know scientifically proven

4316.51 --> 4321.88
or do we know all the phenomena what the

4319.36 --> 4323.98
cause is no that's not what you said you

4321.88 --> 4327.969
talked about freaking variables and then

4323.98 --> 4330.009999999999
drug in the freaking universe that none

4327.969 --> 4333.2390000000005
of it is proven any way into that as

4330.01 --> 4333.2390000000005
well so no

4354.389 --> 4357.38
stop it

4359.01 --> 4362.570000000001
don't talk like that

4378.21 --> 4382.29
Hey hello Adam

4386.05 --> 4399.52
no no Marceline humans are not natural

4391.72 --> 4402.76
phenomena humans are man-made and

4399.52 --> 4405.67
besides you wouldn't be manipulating the

4402.76 --> 4408.400000000001
thing that is the human you can change

4405.67 --> 4410.9800000000005
the human you can alter aspects of it

4408.4 --> 4412.629999999999
but that's not changing the phenomena

4410.98 --> 4418.419999999999
you presume humans are so it's

4412.63 --> 4420.99
ridiculous mother sorry hey

4418.42 --> 4420.99
correct Lottie

4453.219 --> 4456.03
right

4464.01 --> 4471.1
all right so yeah I think I'm gonna

4468.84 --> 4474.4890000000005
round out the show at some point unless

4471.1 --> 4478.179
somebody I'd like to call me up have a

4474.489 --> 4482.5
conversation mmm oh by the way Adam

4478.179 --> 4485.92
showed me yeah the thing he was working

4482.5 --> 4488.64
on for the new format for my show and I

4485.92 --> 4492.21
was just absolutely blown away by that

4488.64 --> 4492.21
looked really epic

4496.27 --> 4502.35
okay Marceline got to be careful with

4500.14 --> 4502.35
that [ __ ]

4504.42 --> 4509.77
no reckoner Stefan hey listen what if

4507.07 --> 4511.2699999999995
you ask that again I will it's really

4509.77 --> 4514.42
annoying and stupid

4511.27 --> 4520.05
when you do that you realize that right

4514.42 --> 4522.7300000000005
because if if you ask am i blocked and

4520.05 --> 4525.900000000001
you are then nobody's going to see it if

4522.73 --> 4528.7
you aren't then you're just a dumbass

4525.9 --> 4533.73
because you already answered the

4528.7 --> 4533.73
question by it being visible so

4539.519 --> 4542.4490000000005
okay
