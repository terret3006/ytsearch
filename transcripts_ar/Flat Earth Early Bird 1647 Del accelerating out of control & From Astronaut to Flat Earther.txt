6.359 --> 37.71
foreign

7.82 --> 37.71
[Music]

76.1 --> 81.259
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

79.799 --> 85.14
bird number

81.259 --> 86.759
1647 I'm your host R win and before I

85.14 --> 89.28
start the show please don't forget to

86.759 --> 92.22
share it on any platform you deem fit

89.28 --> 94.74
and if you haven't already subscribe to

92.22 --> 96.96
my channel hit the Bell notification so

94.74 --> 99.29899999999999
you know when I'm going live which is

96.96 --> 101.15899999999999
normally 1pm Amsterdam time and weekdays

99.299 --> 103.97900000000001
and 2PM Amsterdam time in the weekend

101.159 --> 106.43900000000001
and please also do support me through

103.979 --> 110.34
the PayPal and the patreon will be much

106.439 --> 112.79899999999999
appreciated and very much needed

110.34 --> 115.22
right so yeah the weather today is

112.799 --> 115.22000000000001
really

115.259 --> 120.18
yeah not great

118.079 --> 124.32
it's fully clouded

120.18 --> 126.659
and it's raining regularly

124.32 --> 129.78
been very Stormy this night had to like

126.659 --> 131.03900000000002
fix my my pot of plants between the

129.78 --> 133.02
railing

131.039 --> 134.78
just so they wouldn't get blown all over

133.02 --> 137.76000000000002
the place

134.78 --> 141.2
but that works

137.76 --> 141.2
and they're still doing fine

145.8 --> 151.86
right but uh yeah I think it cooled down

148.86 --> 153.59900000000002
a bit although not as much as you would

151.86 --> 157.64000000000001
think

153.599 --> 157.64
still in the 20s I think

158.239 --> 163.879
but not a lot

161.459 --> 163.879
right

165.12 --> 170.16
wow got a full chat right away

168.18 --> 173.54000000000002
a little flatter stage first in chat

170.16 --> 176.04
clammy Bill Martin science denier

173.54 --> 178.26
anteluvian catharsis

176.04 --> 184.85999999999999
yeah good to see you all

178.26 --> 184.85999999999999
it is Saturday the 1st of July 2023

186.0 --> 188.72
all right

194.459 --> 201.379
let's check the temperature

197.58 --> 201.37900000000002
probably like 21.

202.739 --> 209.3
oh

204.48 --> 209.29999999999998
no it was 19. I thought so

213.86 --> 219.8
right does seem like that's as cold as

216.78 --> 219.8
it will get

220.14 --> 226.73899999999998
hmm according to this by

223.799 --> 230.58
next Friday

226.739 --> 232.379
you'll get warmer and sunnier again

230.58 --> 233.87900000000002
right so it's going to be a bit of a

232.379 --> 236.29899999999998
rainy week according to these

233.879 --> 236.29899999999998
predictions

236.34 --> 240.14000000000001
hey Richard G good to see you

249.46 --> 252.71
[Music]

259.62 --> 262.62
foreign

273.919 --> 278.96
are you saying the fairies are still

276.24 --> 278.96000000000004
going over there

280.32 --> 284.46
oh

282.18 --> 288.6
what the hell

284.46 --> 291.19899999999996
oh god look who's here Dell

288.6 --> 291.199
hello

294.139 --> 301.52
objects accelerate

296.699 --> 301.52000000000004
oh if they're dancer

302.16 --> 307.86
and then whatever is going to be inside

303.96 --> 310.52
of the object is like a microcosm

307.86 --> 313.74
and depending on the acceleration rate

310.52 --> 315.53999999999996
the density axis within the accelerating

313.74 --> 318.56
medium itself

315.54 --> 318.56
will reverse

324.24 --> 329.40000000000003
right and has nothing to do with

327.3 --> 332.52000000000004
whatever the Earth is supposedly doing

329.4 --> 334.44
pre supposedly doing which is what you

332.52 --> 336.85999999999996
are talking about on your show all the

334.44 --> 336.86
time though

337.02 --> 340.02
foreign

353.3 --> 357.08
accelerate themselves

357.9 --> 362.63899999999995
well yeah

360.479 --> 365.58
pretty much the

362.639 --> 368.52
this equilibrium with the environment

365.58 --> 369.9
with the medium it is in will cause the

368.52 --> 375.65999999999997
acceleration

369.9 --> 375.65999999999997
but if an object itself is accelerating

376.139 --> 384.259
then that will cause like a

379.56 --> 384.259
yeah a reversed microcosm within it

389.759 --> 394.68
right but technically in accordance to

392.699 --> 397.8
the scientific method

394.68 --> 401.1
it is the disequilibrium that means it's

397.8 --> 402.96000000000004
not the object that's doing it it's the

401.1 --> 405.36
relation between the object and the

402.96 --> 406.13899999999995
medium the density relation that's the

405.36 --> 409.74
thing

406.139 --> 413.22
that is the cause that's the thing that

409.74 --> 415.699
is manipulated in order to prove that it

413.22 --> 415.699
is the cause

419.4 --> 423.84
So within the medium and Free Fall the

421.8 --> 424.68
motion stops why I just explained that

423.84 --> 427.19899999999996
though

424.68 --> 429.919
hey Adam making I literally just

427.199 --> 433.319
explained that it's because

429.919 --> 437.46
apparently this is what happens if you

433.319 --> 439.68
have a medium that is an object within a

437.46 --> 441.23999999999995
medium like if an object is a medium on

439.68 --> 443.46
itself

441.24 --> 446.94
is a little closed system and that

443.46 --> 448.5
object accelerates then whatever happens

446.94 --> 451.86
inside

448.5 --> 455.16
the density axis of that micro medium

451.86 --> 457.5
inside it reverses

455.16 --> 460.02000000000004
so an accelerating medium basically

457.5 --> 462.56
negates the density axis if it's going

460.02 --> 465.06
to be downward acceleration

462.56 --> 468.72
then it will neutralize it and if it

465.06 --> 471.96
accelerates down twice as fast so not a

468.72 --> 474.74
natural fall it would be a propelled to

471.96 --> 477.9
go faster accelerating down then inside

474.74 --> 481.46000000000004
you'll notice that the medium will give

477.9 --> 481.46
a like complete reversal

481.5 --> 486.24
like a heavy up object within that mini

484.44 --> 490.44
medium

486.24 --> 493.5
well float will like Rush upwards while

490.44 --> 495.3
a air bubble will Rush downwards and I

493.5 --> 497.4
mean to the bottom

495.3 --> 498.84000000000003
but I mean yeah you're not gonna have a

497.4 --> 501.71999999999997
long enough

498.84 --> 504.599
path for a double accelerating down

501.72 --> 507.18
object in order to really show that

504.599 --> 510.12
clearly because that's like a

507.18 --> 514.02
pretty heavy project I mean accelerating

510.12 --> 517.44
is not just falling accelerating down

514.02 --> 521.039
right twice the speed that's going to be

517.44 --> 523.2600000000001
a long pathway in a very short time

521.039 --> 525.3
but yeah that's how advanced relative

523.26 --> 526.74
density Works which is not scientific by

525.3 --> 528.7199999999999
the way but it is based on the

526.74 --> 530.1
scientific experiment of relative

528.72 --> 534.4200000000001
density

530.1 --> 538.5
and that is observably what happens

534.42 --> 542.6999999999999
I'm Not Really Gonna speculate as to the

538.5 --> 545.519
cause of why it works that way I'm just

542.7 --> 548.72
concerned with describing

545.519 --> 548.72
how it works

550.64 --> 553.72
[Music]

557.279 --> 562.14
so when you show what actually happens

559.92 --> 565.1999999999999
when accelerated towards the Earth what

562.14 --> 567.3
are you gonna say I'm gonna say that you

565.2 --> 569.88
are having a object

567.3 --> 571.74
throwing it down because it is much more

569.88 --> 573.779
dense than the medium it is in so it

571.74 --> 576.24
will have an acceleration

573.779 --> 579.54
although there is friction

576.24 --> 583.08
there's gas impeding its movement

579.54 --> 586.4399999999999
so it will have a maximum velocity right

583.08 --> 589.62
it it can't accelerate forever but while

586.44 --> 594.72
it is accelerating down with slight

589.62 --> 598.5
impedance the density axis within that

594.72 --> 600.839
bottle will neutralize almost not

598.5 --> 603.42
completely and also it is going to be

600.839 --> 604.62
subjected to vibrations because I mean

603.42 --> 607.1999999999999
it's not a

604.62 --> 610.8
super stable trajectory the object's not

607.2 --> 612.5400000000001
super stable it's a water bottle uh not

610.8 --> 614.8389999999999
it's a plastic water bottle if it was

612.54 --> 616.4399999999999
glass it would work more

614.839 --> 618.36
unimpeded

616.44 --> 619.86
from resonance but because it's plastic

618.36 --> 622.08
it's flexible

619.86 --> 624.3000000000001
it's going to be tough to really

622.08 --> 626.58
demonstrate it right but when you throw

624.3 --> 630.12
water bottle whatever is inside of it

626.58 --> 634.019
well the axis of the density how it is

630.12 --> 636.0
divided will almost neutralize because

634.019 --> 637.08
of its free fall but not completely

636.0 --> 639.899
because

637.08 --> 643.26
to have perfect neutralization

639.899 --> 646.62
you need to perfectly accelerate which

643.26 --> 649.62
means faster than fall that's why

646.62 --> 652.38
you need to vomit comma to dive it can't

649.62 --> 655.26
just fall it has to go slightly faster

652.38 --> 658.2
to perfectly match

655.26 --> 661.56
that acceleration rate

658.2 --> 664.5
and thereby neutralize the density axis

661.56 --> 667.079
of the objects within the medium that is

664.5 --> 669.18
the object that is accelerating down to

667.079 --> 671.54
perfectly neutralize the density axis

669.18 --> 671.54
Within

673.2 --> 678.0790000000001
can I demonstrate what I'm talking about

675.24 --> 678.0790000000001
nope

678.48 --> 684.0600000000001
and if you have a problem with that then

681.18 --> 686.3389999999999
I can't help you

684.06 --> 690.3199999999999
because I'm just here to explain it I'm

686.339 --> 690.32
not here to do demonstrations

691.98 --> 695.169
[Music]

699.42 --> 704.64
but I guarantee you I'm correct I

702.12 --> 708.12
absolutely guaranteed whatever test you

704.64 --> 710.279
will eventually do everything I said is

708.12 --> 712.5600000000001
perfectly correct

710.279 --> 714.72
like it is so correct you can literally

712.56 --> 717.06
put it on the Spectrum and everything in

714.72 --> 719.64
between will show you a perfect linear

717.06 --> 721.68
ratio of everything I just explained

719.64 --> 723.48
about Advanced relative density that's

721.68 --> 726.18
how it works

723.48 --> 728.76
and I'm sure at some point some person

726.18 --> 731.0999999999999
that's more mathematically

728.76 --> 733.62
inclined will

731.1 --> 738.6800000000001
show you a perfect formula for that

733.62 --> 738.68
entire effect the medium within a medium

739.019 --> 745.32
but I'm not that person because I'm more

741.959 --> 749.7199999999999
concerned with trying to describe it

745.32 --> 749.72
and not building a mathematical formula

754.86 --> 762.66
don't talk to me like that Dell

757.56 --> 762.66
that you [ __ ] Derek homie Glover okay

763.2 --> 769.62
I mean keep your social friction that

767.579 --> 772.579
you have on the inside to yourself yeah

769.62 --> 772.579
I'm not a Glover

774.42 --> 780.54
yeah globers don't Master the globe

778.079 --> 784.38
they don't because they believe in it

780.54 --> 786.3
instead doesn't coincide yeah I'm not a

784.38 --> 788.42
globe I couldn't be

786.3 --> 790.68
you could think that I'm some

788.42 --> 792.42
anti-flatter or that's so good at it

790.68 --> 794.8199999999999
that these left flat earther again but

792.42 --> 796.92
what it that's just paranoia

794.82 --> 800.839
I'm not a glober and to accuse me of

796.92 --> 800.8389999999999
that is absolutely preposterous

802.74 --> 807.32
same rhetoric

804.779 --> 807.32
yeah

808.2 --> 814.26
uh you don't know about rhetoric

811.8 --> 816.7199999999999
though what I'm talking about there's no

814.26 --> 818.9399999999999
Global out there that says that

816.72 --> 823.44
yeah nobody talks about Advanced

818.94 --> 825.98
relative density I literally put it on

823.44 --> 825.98
the map

826.2 --> 834.36
yeah I put it on the map

830.76 --> 836.579
there is no glober out there

834.36 --> 839.7
that says that

836.579 --> 842.779
I think you're engaging in a projection

839.7 --> 842.779
here though

845.519 --> 851.04
claims and demonstrable but yeah but

848.16 --> 853.92
your mechanical oversight and the actual

851.04 --> 855.18
conclusions you draw are pretty pathetic

853.92 --> 858.12
though

855.18 --> 860.2199999999999
and Buckley as hell

858.12 --> 862.92
yeah I listened to some of your

860.22 --> 865.5
elaborate explanation when when you're

862.92 --> 868.26
actually intelligible enough

865.5 --> 870.66
to be able to follow what you're saying

868.26 --> 872.579
yeah you make mistakes all over the

870.66 --> 874.56
place you don't correct it you don't

872.579 --> 876.899
even realize it when you did make a

874.56 --> 878.76
mistake in your explanation you are

876.899 --> 881.1
clumsy as hell

878.76 --> 882.899
and you're really just so in confusion

881.1 --> 884.399
all over the place though with what

882.899 --> 886.68
you're doing

884.399 --> 888.72
and you're dragging other people along

886.68 --> 892.2199999999999
with you

888.72 --> 892.22
it's quite disturbing

892.68 --> 898.1389999999999
and me and the FED team are officially

896.639 --> 899.88
going to ask you if you could please

898.139 --> 902.1
stop doing that

899.88 --> 905.279
because you're mostly just embarrassing

902.1 --> 908.399
yourself if you even care about that

905.279 --> 910.56
but you are having a negative and

908.399 --> 913.68
distracting impact

910.56 --> 917.279
on flat earthers around us and we would

913.68 --> 920.18
really like if you'd stop doing that

917.279 --> 920.18
thank you very much

920.46 --> 923.529
[Music]

926.579 --> 932.04
all right Dell

929.699 --> 935.519
now you can see

932.04 --> 937.62
this activity in my chat like a man

935.519 --> 940.079
or I could kick you out like a troll

937.62 --> 943.079
it's up to you

940.079 --> 943.9799999999999
but stop blabbering your mouth off like

943.079 --> 946.56
this

943.98 --> 948.1800000000001
you're a grown adult you know better

946.56 --> 950.28
than this

948.18 --> 956.419
all right

950.28 --> 956.419
[Music]

959.6 --> 966.1990000000001
[Music]

961.56 --> 966.199
yeah yeah don't call me son boy

966.839 --> 970.8000000000001
and stop projecting yeah I don't know

969.0 --> 972.54
what the hell is going on with you why

970.8 --> 975.899
you're so

972.54 --> 978.48
in turmoil with yourself but yeah that's

975.899 --> 981.36
not my situation you're projecting

978.48 --> 985.86
you're continually creating friction

981.36 --> 988.5
everywhere continually accusing people

985.86 --> 990.1800000000001
without backing without actual

988.5 --> 991.98
argumentation

990.18 --> 994.079
just a bunch of

991.98 --> 997.5600000000001
fluffer nutting

994.079 --> 1001.04
okay it's nonsense stop it though you're

997.56 --> 1003.56
not you're not fooling anyone

1001.04 --> 1005.66
except for a bunch of numpties that are

1003.56 --> 1008.66
just like Yay is it finally gonna

1005.66 --> 1010.639
explode yeah yeah those people that that

1008.66 --> 1012.019
just love your activity though you know

1010.639 --> 1015.199
who they are

1012.019 --> 1017.66
they are numpties that are just waiting

1015.199 --> 1020.18
desperately for Flat Earth to destroy

1017.66 --> 1022.16
itself and they love what you're doing

1020.18 --> 1024.6789999999999
that's the rush that's

1022.16 --> 1027.26
why you're getting all that attention

1024.679 --> 1028.76
those are the bacteria that are just

1027.26 --> 1031.52
waiting

1028.76 --> 1034.04
for your cell wall to collapse so they

1031.52 --> 1036.02
can start feeding off you and hopefully

1034.04 --> 1039.52
the disease will spread so they can feed

1036.02 --> 1041.959
on others that's why they're there Del

1039.52 --> 1044.299
those are the people that are fed up

1041.959 --> 1047.799
with the

1044.299 --> 1047.799
with the dream Breakers

1048.14 --> 1053.66
the reality out there and and the

1050.419 --> 1055.46
hardness of the level

1053.66 --> 1057.26
of understanding

1055.46 --> 1059.9
because it's tough on some people and

1057.26 --> 1061.82
they don't like it and they get sick and

1059.9 --> 1062.9
tired of it and then they just wanted to

1061.82 --> 1065.6
stop

1062.9 --> 1067.64
but it won't stop so they're just gonna

1065.6 --> 1069.4399999999998
look out for people that are gonna go

1067.64 --> 1071.96
ballistic that are gonna lose control

1069.44 --> 1074.78
that are losing

1071.96 --> 1077.1200000000001
appetite for engagement

1074.78 --> 1078.9189999999999
in the hopes that they will break it all

1077.12 --> 1080.6599999999999
apart and that's exactly what you're

1078.919 --> 1083.2990000000002
doing though

1080.66 --> 1086.74
is exactly what you're doing you have

1083.299 --> 1086.74
been doing now for weeks

1089.059 --> 1093.799
I think you need some emotional

1091.46 --> 1096.44
counseling or something

1093.799 --> 1098.6
and it normally wouldn't just say it

1096.44 --> 1101.96
like that I would keep that private but

1098.6 --> 1104.0
because you're acting out so bad

1101.96 --> 1105.8600000000001
I'm just gonna say it straightforward

1104.0 --> 1107.72
you need to get some emotional

1105.86 --> 1111.8799999999999
counseling buddy

1107.72 --> 1111.88
you you have not been doing very good

1113.539 --> 1117.62
because that's why you need to throw it

1115.88 --> 1119.48
out all the time

1117.62 --> 1120.86
and you keep falling back to the same

1119.48 --> 1122.72
subject

1120.86 --> 1125.36
yeah

1122.72 --> 1127.46
you know what defines a fool right

1125.36 --> 1129.26
it's a person that does the same thing

1127.46 --> 1131.679
over and over again expecting different

1129.26 --> 1131.679
results

1131.9 --> 1135.799
yeah you're regurgitating you're saying

1134.059 --> 1140.539
conceptions over and over again

1135.799 --> 1143.179
expecting people to adapt to it

1140.539 --> 1146.179
when the mechanical premise of it all is

1143.179 --> 1148.2800000000002
completely nonsensical yeah you actually

1146.179 --> 1152.26
concluding that the Earth would be

1148.28 --> 1154.82
moving upward is absolutely

1152.26 --> 1158.32
abominably stupid

1154.82 --> 1161.12
it's really [ __ ] stupid and makes you

1158.32 --> 1164.6599999999999
mechanically inept

1161.12 --> 1168.62
tell it makes you mechanically inept

1164.66 --> 1171.44
there is no logical theoretical virtual

1168.62 --> 1173.9599999999998
train of thought that would logically

1171.44 --> 1176.3600000000001
lead you to conclude that you could

1173.96 --> 1180.38
presuppose the Earth would be moving

1176.36 --> 1183.08
upward it is absolutely idiotic

1180.38 --> 1185.6000000000001
and you should get yourself checked

1183.08 --> 1188.74
for that Dell

1185.6 --> 1188.74
it's pathetic

1189.98 --> 1195.02
and I'm sorry I have to be so blunt like

1192.26 --> 1198.32
this but you're literally in my chat

1195.02 --> 1201.679
acting like a complete [ __ ] so I'm

1198.32 --> 1203.72
gonna do this to your face

1201.679 --> 1205.46
because you asked for it maybe that's

1203.72 --> 1206.419
what you need maybe that's the Scottish

1205.46 --> 1208.1000000000001
way

1206.419 --> 1211.16
because you're so headstrong you need

1208.1 --> 1215.1399999999999
somebody to bash it into

1211.16 --> 1215.14
and I'm doing that for you right now

1222.559 --> 1228.28
yeah objects accelerate by themselves

1225.2 --> 1228.28
it's what's happening

1228.5 --> 1235.34
I know it you don't like that but it is

1232.76 --> 1237.02
palpably provably happening

1235.34 --> 1241.34
it's one of those things you can prove

1237.02 --> 1247.0
yeah unlike what the entire realm is

1241.34 --> 1247.0
doing in any presupposed types of motion

1248.0 --> 1253.1
you lost track buddy you have no more

1250.82 --> 1256.9399999999998
oversight over what you are thinking

1253.1 --> 1259.52
about with this moving upward Realm

1256.94 --> 1262.28
you lost grip

1259.52 --> 1264.98
you don't have logical mechanical

1262.28 --> 1268.36
oversight probably or you would never

1264.98 --> 1268.3600000000001
come to that conclusion

1270.02 --> 1275.9
that is not a global clown refugees just

1272.66 --> 1278.96
a very very confused person that has

1275.9 --> 1281.179
emotional issues and I wish I wish I

1278.96 --> 1284.78
could help him see it

1281.179 --> 1288.3200000000002
but he's just super head strong

1284.78 --> 1292.34
and he just refuses to look

1288.32 --> 1294.9189999999999
to actually let his thing go for a bit

1292.34 --> 1297.08
and actually look as to what people are

1294.919 --> 1298.5800000000002
describing because he's automatically

1297.08 --> 1301.22
assuming I think

1298.58 --> 1305.12
that he's being attacked instead of like

1301.22 --> 1307.64
hey maybe the person is something to add

1305.12 --> 1309.559
to what I'm saying maybe I'm really

1307.64 --> 1312.5
trying to help you get that oversight

1309.559 --> 1314.799
backdo have you ever thought of that

1312.5 --> 1317.36
you come in my chat you ask me questions

1314.799 --> 1319.94
I gave you answers

1317.36 --> 1321.9189999999999
did I not give Dell answers guys in chat

1319.94 --> 1325.6000000000001
price of Adam and to live in catharsis

1321.919 --> 1328.46
Refugee well if you did I not give Dell

1325.6 --> 1331.34
straight out explanations and answers

1328.46 --> 1335.919
did I not

1331.34 --> 1335.9189999999999
to every mechanical question you had

1353.0 --> 1358.28
that's right

1355.1 --> 1360.98
because I don't avoid

1358.28 --> 1362.8999999999999
the actual issues

1360.98 --> 1365.72
I don't avoid issue I don't even avoid

1362.9 --> 1368.0
emotional issues sometimes trolls think

1365.72 --> 1370.28
that they can just come and at home me

1368.0 --> 1372.86
or emotionally attack me say something

1370.28 --> 1375.02
about my hair or say something about my

1372.86 --> 1377.6589999999999
relationship status or something right

1375.02 --> 1380.96
or my job status

1377.659 --> 1383.659
and guess what happens I address it

1380.96 --> 1386.72
right people don't even expect me to do

1383.659 --> 1389.9
that but I do it anyway because I do not

1386.72 --> 1392.6000000000001
avoid confrontation

1389.9 --> 1395.44
yeah normal people at this one would

1392.6 --> 1395.4399999999998
have just kicked you out

1395.539 --> 1400.4
or if I were flat so I'd invite you on

1398.059 --> 1403.34
and then I've adjusted back and forth

1400.4 --> 1406.159
shouting match for like an hour

1403.34 --> 1409.24
but yeah I I don't like I'm not a

1406.159 --> 1409.24
masochist like that

1412.64 --> 1419.0200000000002
I'm making a mockery of reality objects

1416.0 --> 1419.02
moving by themselves

1424.94 --> 1432.14
how dare I how dare I talk like that

1428.78 --> 1433.7
yeah well they're provably doing it

1432.14 --> 1435.6200000000001
they're doing it

1433.7 --> 1436.88
wow yeah

1435.62 --> 1439.9399999999998
yeah

1436.88 --> 1442.0390000000002
when you take a rock

1439.94 --> 1443.96
you think about it you like try to

1442.039 --> 1446.12
squeeze the Rock and it's like holy [ __ ]

1443.96 --> 1448.4
that thing is dense

1446.12 --> 1451.34
it's really really dance this is strong

1448.4 --> 1452.8400000000001
stuff and then you go like oh air whoa I

1451.34 --> 1454.82
can just go through I can still feel

1452.84 --> 1456.86
it's there it's really light yeah yeah

1454.82 --> 1461.6589999999999
and you take the rock you drop it and

1456.86 --> 1463.6999999999998
it's like it moves by itself yes

1461.659 --> 1466.88
it's Fallen

1463.7 --> 1468.5
and it's because it's denser than that

1466.88 --> 1471.5
really light air

1468.5 --> 1472.82
yeah it's just moving by itself amazing

1471.5 --> 1475.46
isn't it

1472.82 --> 1477.86
it's just moving just like that

1475.46 --> 1479.72
right and you know why it's moving

1477.86 --> 1484.3999999999999
because well

1479.72 --> 1487.34
if you drop a rock in a pool of Mercury

1484.4 --> 1490.419
it's not gonna fall it's gonna kind of

1487.34 --> 1493.6399999999999
float on it why well because the Mercury

1490.419 --> 1495.98
it's super super dense

1493.64 --> 1497.7800000000002
right so dense you can't get through

1495.98 --> 1499.4
that with a rock

1497.78 --> 1502.1
you can't even get through that with an

1499.4 --> 1506.419
anvil and that's even more dense than

1502.1 --> 1509.6
the rock so yeah it just moves by itself

1506.419 --> 1511.76
just like that why because it's

1509.6 --> 1514.1589999999999
surrounded by a medium that's less dense

1511.76 --> 1515.78
amazing isn't it it's called relative

1514.159 --> 1518.0200000000002
density Theory

1515.78 --> 1520.34
and it's experimented

1518.02 --> 1521.6
experimentally valid

1520.34 --> 1524.6599999999999
amazing isn't it

1521.6 --> 1524.6599999999999
[Music]

1526.88 --> 1531.679
yeah yeah they do though rocks do move

1529.94 --> 1534.44
by themselves

1531.679 --> 1537.1000000000001
in that scenario

1534.44 --> 1537.1000000000001
yeah

1537.679 --> 1542.1200000000001
I mean it's not gonna just move upwards

1541.039 --> 1545.12
first

1542.12 --> 1547.1589999999999
you're gonna have to apply a force

1545.12 --> 1549.08
with your body

1547.159 --> 1552.74
to put it there

1549.08 --> 1555.98
of course right it's not just gonna

1552.74 --> 1558.559
go in Circles by itself but if a rock

1555.98 --> 1561.22
just happens to find itself in the

1558.559 --> 1564.559
middle of the air yeah

1561.22 --> 1566.84
it will just start to fall it it just

1564.559 --> 1571.96
does that amazing isn't it

1566.84 --> 1571.9599999999998
right it just does that all by itself

1572.24 --> 1578.9
nothing has to push it pull it nothing

1575.0 --> 1580.82
it just starts to fall why because it's

1578.9 --> 1583.5800000000002
surrounded by air which is so much less

1580.82 --> 1586.52
dense and so look at that this

1583.58 --> 1588.86
equilibrium between that right between

1586.52 --> 1592.1589999999999
the object and the medium and and sadly

1588.86 --> 1595.8999999999999
it starts to accelerate all by itself

1592.159 --> 1595.9
isn't that just amazing

1597.32 --> 1601.0
yeah astounding isn't it

1603.08 --> 1606.26
Magic

1604.64 --> 1609.74
it's magic

1606.26 --> 1611.059
a magic indeed reality reality is very

1609.74 --> 1612.26
magical

1611.059 --> 1615.26
right

1612.26 --> 1618.08
but I mean technically it's not really

1615.26 --> 1621.14
magic because I literally just described

1618.08 --> 1623.1789999999999
exactly how it works it's actually

1621.14 --> 1625.1000000000001
science though

1623.179 --> 1628.419
don't you realize that it's actually

1625.1 --> 1633.1399999999999
science yeah science is very magical too

1628.419 --> 1635.5590000000002
except that you actually figure out how

1633.14 --> 1635.5590000000002
it happens

1636.14 --> 1640.94
provably repeatedly

1639.22 --> 1642.02
empirically

1640.94 --> 1645.02
yeah

1642.02 --> 1646.72
and then the magic suddenly isn't a

1645.02 --> 1648.58
mysterious

1646.72 --> 1651.799
undescribable

1648.58 --> 1653.539
uncomprehensible thing Suddenly It's the

1651.799 --> 1655.4
cause of an effect that you can

1653.539 --> 1657.14
manipulate and

1655.4 --> 1660.5590000000002
and look

1657.14 --> 1663.74
you now know why and how it does what it

1660.559 --> 1667.48
does it's not magic anymore

1663.74 --> 1667.48
it's called the scientific method

1670.159 --> 1674.3600000000001
I'm such a fantasist

1673.039 --> 1676.22
oh my God

1674.36 --> 1678.6789999999999
what are we talking we are talking about

1676.22 --> 1681.679
the relative density and Common Sense

1678.679 --> 1685.8400000000001
here tarot or at least I'm trying to but

1681.679 --> 1688.8400000000001
Dell's having a real hard time with it

1685.84 --> 1688.84
foreign

1689.62 --> 1694.2399999999998
yourself a place in the title buddy

1698.48 --> 1701.48
uh

1706.76 --> 1710.419
yeah

1708.02 --> 1712.7
yeah I mean but price for Adam flutter

1710.419 --> 1717.0200000000002
Sage look at what he's Dell saying

1712.7 --> 1722.559
It's Magic it's all magical

1717.02 --> 1722.559
dude no it's not magical it's science

1725.12 --> 1731.4189999999999
I mean really you really should have

1729.26 --> 1733.1589999999999
yourself checked ma'am I mean this is

1731.419 --> 1735.26
not good if you're gonna call that magic

1733.159 --> 1737.2990000000002
it

1735.26 --> 1738.919
it's like did you have like an aneurysm

1737.299 --> 1741.2
or something I mean I don't want to be

1738.919 --> 1743.9
get rough but did you like have some

1741.2 --> 1747.74
heavy Amnesia or something

1743.9 --> 1751.22
did you forget a lot of things

1747.74 --> 1754.0
because it's not magical it's just

1751.22 --> 1754.0
science

1755.299 --> 1759.3799999999999
and we know

1758.0 --> 1761.96
me

1759.38 --> 1764.72
and the people at fed we know you

1761.96 --> 1766.3990000000001
followed us we know you've been around

1764.72 --> 1770.6200000000001
you've been watching

1766.399 --> 1770.62
you should know better than this

1771.86 --> 1776.86
no

1773.48 --> 1776.8600000000001
it's really disappointing

1781.82 --> 1786.5
their objects move by themselves is

1784.22 --> 1789.6200000000001
Narnia Magic

1786.5 --> 1792.82
yeah no it's scientifically proven

1789.62 --> 1792.82
that's what it is

1794.0 --> 1797.84
yeah

1795.32 --> 1801.76
it's not taking place in a medium that

1797.84 --> 1804.799
doesn't exist you can very manipulate

1801.76 --> 1807.08
the density of the medium or the object

1804.799 --> 1809.059
in order to alter

1807.08 --> 1810.9189999999999
the force

1809.059 --> 1812.4189999999999
that arises because of the

1810.919 --> 1814.88
disequilibrium

1812.419 --> 1817.5200000000002
you can alter this yeah it's it's not

1814.88 --> 1821.2990000000002
taking place in Narnia it is flaking

1817.52 --> 1824.6
place here in the real world and you can

1821.299 --> 1826.58
right now very manipulated in order to

1824.6 --> 1828.26
change the outcome

1826.58 --> 1831.9189999999999
yeah

1828.26 --> 1835.84
it's not Narnia magic It's Magic right

1831.919 --> 1835.8400000000001
here in this world in reality

1836.36 --> 1841.4189999999999
and you can show it using the scientific

1838.94 --> 1841.419
method

1850.22 --> 1854.02
yeah I know it's great material

1855.44 --> 1859.3400000000001
yeah I've I've got some experience

1857.6 --> 1862.039
though

1859.34 --> 1863.779
I don't occasionally do a live stream

1862.039 --> 1864.919
because I feel like ranting about

1863.779 --> 1868.82
something

1864.919 --> 1870.2
no I do a live stream every day except

1868.82 --> 1872.6789999999999
yesterday

1870.2 --> 1875.179
because I overslept a lot

1872.679 --> 1877.76
I wasn't the only one by the way it was

1875.179 --> 1880.3990000000001
weird something in the air yeah but I I

1877.76 --> 1884.12
live stream every day

1880.399 --> 1885.86
I've got almost

1884.12 --> 1889.4599999999998
is it

1885.86 --> 1892.039
4 000 hours

1889.46 --> 1895.299
of streaming behind me I've got some

1892.039 --> 1895.299
experience doing this

1897.5 --> 1904.299
yeah I'm very confident about the things

1900.14 --> 1904.2990000000002
that I know and that I figured out

1907.52 --> 1910.4189999999999
uh

1911.12 --> 1916.4799999999998
yeah yeah yeah yeah keep keep projecting

1914.059 --> 1916.48
buddy

1920.14 --> 1924.2
you can do all things in the world you

1923.0 --> 1928.46
like

1924.2 --> 1932.659
doesn't give you any kind of legitimacy

1928.46 --> 1936.32
if your conceptions are just wrong

1932.659 --> 1939.98
and mechanically unsound

1936.32 --> 1943.1589999999999
yeah your conclusion is that the Earth

1939.98 --> 1946.1
is moving upward and that that's the

1943.159 --> 1948.5200000000002
reason why things displace passively

1946.1 --> 1952.1789999999999
then you are

1948.52 --> 1952.179
mathematically inept

1954.62 --> 1959.7199999999998
and that's me saying it okay and I'm not

1958.159 --> 1961.22
a star at math

1959.72 --> 1963.799
but I know

1961.22 --> 1965.059
and if that is your conclusion that you

1963.799 --> 1966.74
are inept

1965.059 --> 1970.1589999999999
that's like

1966.74 --> 1971.84
a step below my level

1970.159 --> 1974.44
that you got that you're getting wrong

1971.84 --> 1974.4399999999998
though

1975.919 --> 1982.5200000000002
yeah you're not the first one to

1979.22 --> 1985.039
Ponder upon the conception of an

1982.52 --> 1988.039
accelerating upward Earth which it must

1985.039 --> 1989.96
be yeah moving upwards not gonna do it

1988.039 --> 1992.48
you dumbass

1989.96 --> 1994.76
and accelerating right but there's other

1992.48 --> 1997.34
models too you guys don't see you

1994.76 --> 1999.08
talking about that option right what

1997.34 --> 2000.9399999999998
about pendulum Earth

1999.08 --> 2002.5
yeah this could just be a pendulum and

2000.94 --> 2004.419
swingers just

2002.5 --> 2006.399
very long

2004.419 --> 2009.519
long arm

2006.399 --> 2012.1
big swing

2009.519 --> 2014.14
big slow swing yeah that that could be

2012.1 --> 2017.82
happening why would it even have to be

2014.14 --> 2021.159
accelerating you could turn it into

2017.82 --> 2024.519
centrifugal force like that

2021.159 --> 2027.0390000000002
on a very small small space right that's

2024.519 --> 2029.08
where it's not a ring not an annoyed

2027.039 --> 2030.64
this ring or whatever no no just the

2029.08 --> 2031.6789999999999
pendulum you have this little realm

2030.64 --> 2034.3600000000001
thing

2031.679 --> 2036.7
very long arm

2034.36 --> 2040.12
and that swings like a clock so we're

2036.7 --> 2043.179
like the tip of the of the arm of a

2040.12 --> 2044.86
clock and removing relatively slowly

2043.179 --> 2047.74
because the arm's so long yeah and that

2044.86 --> 2049.54
could create the centrifugal force that

2047.74 --> 2051.52
would be just like an accelerating

2049.54 --> 2054.82
upward realm except

2051.52 --> 2056.679
it's in one system

2054.82 --> 2060.159
so there is

2056.679 --> 2062.98
lesser need of this volume right because

2060.159 --> 2064.839
with an accelerating upward motion realm

2062.98 --> 2065.859
then there has all has to be all this

2064.839 --> 2067.72
space

2065.859 --> 2071.619
for it to keep moving has to be this

2067.72 --> 2075.0989999999997
giant infinite potentially infinite tube

2071.619 --> 2077.44
where it's moving and it's makes it all

2075.099 --> 2079.48
volumetrically very

2077.44 --> 2083.139
extreme

2079.48 --> 2086.02
not architecturally efficient

2083.139 --> 2089.02
yeah yeah see because I actually

2086.02 --> 2091.899
understand these things yeah

2089.02 --> 2094.899
unlike you that claims that the Earth

2091.899 --> 2098.7
must be moving upward

2094.899 --> 2098.7
like an inept person

2101.08 --> 2107.339
yeah I actually understand these

2103.599 --> 2107.339
mechanics really well

2107.56 --> 2112.0
you're not the first one to ponder upon

2110.2 --> 2115.5989999999997
these things though

2112.0 --> 2118.3
that was a whole group of Freemasons out

2115.599 --> 2121.1800000000003
there that really like to think about

2118.3 --> 2122.7400000000002
accelerating upward Earth I've met some

2121.18 --> 2125.68
of them in the past

2122.74 --> 2128.339
some young ones

2125.68 --> 2131.44
so it's just an interesting piece of

2128.339 --> 2133.359
physics math conceptualization to to

2131.44 --> 2135.28
think about that it's like oh how could

2133.359 --> 2136.5989999999997
you make it

2135.28 --> 2138.76
right

2136.599 --> 2141.88
yeah it's playing around with physics

2138.76 --> 2144.28
but you can't prove it

2141.88 --> 2147.4
so something you didn't listen to yeah

2144.28 --> 2149.26
when I first responded to this subject

2147.4 --> 2152.14
accelerating upward when you really

2149.26 --> 2153.76
brought it to the table yeah I made a

2152.14 --> 2156.7599999999998
video right away

2153.76 --> 2161.5200000000004
put it in the title

2156.76 --> 2161.5200000000004
but why you can never prove it

2161.619 --> 2164.98
but you're just not listening you're not

2163.78 --> 2167.92
listening

2164.98 --> 2169.9
you're stuck in this journey of trying

2167.92 --> 2172.7200000000003
to experience it

2169.9 --> 2176.14
you're stuck in a mind experiment though

2172.72 --> 2178.72
and you've created it for yourself you

2176.14 --> 2182.16
reinforce it which you're stuck in it

2178.72 --> 2182.16
don't seem to have any

2182.32 --> 2187.7200000000003
peace to fall back to where you could

2185.44 --> 2191.02
just

2187.72 --> 2193.66
to see it for what it is conceptual and

2191.02 --> 2195.94
it's not the only thing

2193.66 --> 2198.0989999999997
and you can never prove it so it's

2195.94 --> 2200.02
pointless it's an aberration if you

2198.099 --> 2202.119
could never prove it

2200.02 --> 2204.7
it's an aberration

2202.119 --> 2207.52
it's pointless to ponder on and it's

2204.7 --> 2209.9199999999996
especially pointless to get all Rowdy

2207.52 --> 2212.44
about and start ad homing other people

2209.92 --> 2215.079
with because of it it's ridiculous

2212.44 --> 2216.7000000000003
you're you're making you're creating

2215.079 --> 2219.3390000000004
fights

2216.7 --> 2221.3199999999997
because of an improvable conception

2219.339 --> 2223.0
though

2221.32 --> 2225.3590000000004
do you realize what you're doing with

2223.0 --> 2225.359
your life

2227.44 --> 2233.68
a skeptic it's you Jeff gashead lots of

2231.82 --> 2236.44
people that chat AV

2233.68 --> 2240.2999999999997
George Sanford

2236.44 --> 2240.3
let's go rockons fossils

2241.9 --> 2245.2200000000003
right anyway

2253.359 --> 2257.38
it's pretty much said in everything I

2255.16 --> 2260.3799999999997
could say I don't think he's listening

2257.38 --> 2261.94
if it's just rambling like piche

2260.38 --> 2264.82
this is kind of what you're reminding me

2261.94 --> 2267.88
of now right right now Dell it reminding

2264.82 --> 2270.4
me of piche you would do this too

2267.88 --> 2272.7400000000002
I'll get like a really straight to the

2270.4 --> 2274.2400000000002
point very hard and he would just start

2272.74 --> 2277.0789999999997
to like a

2274.24 --> 2280.1189999999997
triggered hobo just keep

2277.079 --> 2282.9
regurgitating the same [ __ ] and you're

2280.119 --> 2282.9
doing that now

2287.94 --> 2291.16
don't tell me avoiding the question

2290.14 --> 2292.839
though

2291.16 --> 2294.3999999999996
okay

2292.839 --> 2298.98
just

2294.4 --> 2298.98
get on the [ __ ] out of my chat

2299.14 --> 2304.96
get your ass back

2302.02 --> 2308.2
on your own damn show and you go blabber

2304.96 --> 2312.16
mouth your ass off and you go vomiting

2308.2 --> 2314.6189999999997
up your your clown portrayals of me and

2312.16 --> 2317.8799999999997
you're really stupid ass Impressions

2314.619 --> 2317.88
that are really funny

2318.52 --> 2323.859
and really funny to watch your stupid

2320.98 --> 2326.38
impressions of people because you look

2323.859 --> 2328.9
really funny when doing that yeah not

2326.38 --> 2331.119
because it's a good impression you're

2328.9 --> 2333.88
not very good at making impressions of

2331.119 --> 2337.78
other people you just look really funny

2333.88 --> 2339.4
and silly when doing it Del yeah

2337.78 --> 2343.32
so there you go

2339.4 --> 2343.32
have fun with that on your own show

2348.88 --> 2353.859
all right so let's move on I'm done with

2351.82 --> 2358.5
that [ __ ]

2353.859 --> 2358.5
or projecting [ __ ]

2361.839 --> 2365.7599999999998
hey guns from everyone good to see you

2366.43 --> 2369.8599999999997
[Music]

2370.3 --> 2374.98
yeah I would have kept him around but he

2372.339 --> 2378.119
just kept on ad homing and it just I've

2374.98 --> 2378.119
done it I'm done with it

2380.14 --> 2383.6189999999997
like I want to move on I don't want to

2382.359 --> 2385.9
just

2383.619 --> 2388.42
keep punishing him over and over again

2385.9 --> 2389.98
like two hours straight that's a waste

2388.42 --> 2393.7200000000003
of my energy

2389.98 --> 2393.72
I think I made my points clear enough

2394.24 --> 2399.1189999999997
and now it's time to get the [ __ ] out

2399.16 --> 2401.64
right

2408.88 --> 2413.94
there's what are you talking about Jin

2411.7 --> 2413.9399999999996
Lee

2432.579 --> 2439.42
could prove flood George Sanford you're

2435.52 --> 2442.92
such a [ __ ] the Earth is flat

2439.42 --> 2442.92
I mean seriously

2443.26 --> 2450.119
stop this [ __ ] concave retardation

2445.96 --> 2450.119
dude you really need to stop that

2451.48 --> 2460.359
it's it's getting ridiculous it's flat

2454.78 --> 2463.599
it's flat it's flat it's flat flat flat

2460.359 --> 2465.88
flat flat not [ __ ] concave not a

2463.599 --> 2468.579
sphere there's no curvature either way

2465.88 --> 2470.2000000000003
yeah if you go up you don't end up on

2468.579 --> 2472.6600000000003
the other side of Earth

2470.2 --> 2475.68
stop being a [ __ ] [ __ ]

2472.66 --> 2475.68
it's flat

2476.44 --> 2482.2200000000003
yeah and we don't want religious

2478.9 --> 2485.2000000000003
chanting about that either

2482.22 --> 2488.5
[Music]

2485.2 --> 2491.0789999999997
I kicked Jason McCormack the [ __ ] out of

2488.5 --> 2493.42
my chat for years

2491.079 --> 2495.46
because he was a religious [ __ ] about

2493.42 --> 2497.92
it

2495.46 --> 2499.5
you

2497.92 --> 2501.88
I'm not gonna

2499.5 --> 2504.42
give you that room

2501.88 --> 2504.42
okay

2505.619 --> 2511.06
concavers get the [ __ ] out you have no

2508.359 --> 2512.619
evidence your religious nutcase for no

2511.06 --> 2515.7999999999997
[ __ ] reason

2512.619 --> 2519.2200000000003
yeah there's not even a religion that

2515.8 --> 2520.9
tells you you must believe that

2519.22 --> 2523.4199999999996
okay

2520.9 --> 2526.7200000000003
you're just a niche cult

2523.42 --> 2529.1800000000003
and you have no argumentation and it

2526.72 --> 2531.7599999999998
makes no sense whatsoever anything any

2529.18 --> 2534.2799999999997
concave model makes no [ __ ] sense and

2531.76 --> 2538.78
it's immediately disproven

2534.28 --> 2542.8590000000004
so just stop it just stop it

2538.78 --> 2545.92
yeah keep the concave to your fantasy

2542.859 --> 2548.02
world yeah I'm perfectly fine if you

2545.92 --> 2550.0
want to have some video game Universe

2548.02 --> 2553.48
where you're on the inside of a globe

2550.0 --> 2557.68
cool I'm all for it man it sounds

2553.48 --> 2560.619
awesome yeah in a video game in the not

2557.68 --> 2566.0989999999997
physical reality that's awesome keep it

2560.619 --> 2566.099
there yeah because it's not here

2570.93 --> 2574.0499999999997
[Music]

2575.74 --> 2579.9599999999996
yeah morning LSG could see you

2587.88 --> 2590.88
emotions

2590.94 --> 2598.18
directional vector

2593.5 --> 2600.64
and density gradient just

2598.18 --> 2603.54
containers

2600.64 --> 2603.54
no no

2610.78 --> 2613.92
that's ridiculous

2614.98 --> 2619.38
show me that that law yeah

2624.76 --> 2627.599
that's not true

2634.0 --> 2638.5
do I watch David why's interviews not

2636.7 --> 2643.02
really

2638.5 --> 2643.02
it's all really boring to me

2647.78 --> 2653.6400000000003
[Music]

2650.98 --> 2653.64
okay

2671.04 --> 2677.319
suspect is nah

2674.92 --> 2679.119
it's just Wise It's just wise I mean

2677.319 --> 2683.64
it's I don't see anything super wrong

2679.119 --> 2683.6400000000003
with him it's just a bit boring

2683.8 --> 2688.54
for me but I mean there's a whole bunch

2686.92 --> 2691.06
of people in the world that think he's

2688.54 --> 2693.96
awesome and I'm not against it

2691.06 --> 2693.96
so fine

2705.28 --> 2710.0400000000004
man everybody's super busy in my chat

2707.74 --> 2710.04
today

2711.22 --> 2717.04
what

2713.02 --> 2721.079
RV did a bit about it yeah no doubt

2717.04 --> 2721.079
but RV does video about everybody

2731.68 --> 2735.46
in a way I'm kind of disappointed he

2733.48 --> 2737.8
didn't secretly or at the beginning or

2735.46 --> 2740.859
something make a video about me

2737.8 --> 2743.4
I mean dude I'm a really suspicious

2740.859 --> 2743.4
character

2745.0 --> 2750.54
I mean now I'm super open but I mean in

2748.42 --> 2753.28
the beginning I was like

2750.54 --> 2755.02
I got all this dark growth [ __ ] I might

2753.28 --> 2757.119
have done something in the past I don't

2755.02 --> 2758.68
know I got any dude I was [ __ ]

2757.119 --> 2760.56
suspicious

2758.68 --> 2762.94
to myself

2760.56 --> 2766.9
I'm like why didn't you make a video

2762.94 --> 2768.7000000000003
about me RV damn it I'm suspicious but

2766.9 --> 2771.04
not really I mean I worked it out I'm

2768.7 --> 2773.5
now pretty much an open book

2771.04 --> 2775.619
but I was really suspicious in the

2773.5 --> 2775.619
beginning

2775.839 --> 2780.819
but I don't know who cares

2778.06 --> 2782.7999999999997
I'm sort of joking

2780.819 --> 2785.2
I'm not on your suspect list awesome

2782.8 --> 2787.54
thank you very much

2785.2 --> 2789.8999999999996
I hope I am on your PayPal list though

2787.54 --> 2789.9
so

2790.9 --> 2796.839
I I could really still use support

2794.14 --> 2799.96
I mean and poor old Arwin I'm getting

2796.839 --> 2801.7
all attacked by Dell and oh I'm so poor

2799.96 --> 2803.76
and

2801.7 --> 2803.7599999999998
um

2804.76 --> 2808.0600000000004
no but seriously I I could really use

2807.16 --> 2811.02
support

2808.06 --> 2811.02
that would be great

2814.18 --> 2818.2799999999997
I'm not just talking to you in general

2818.74 --> 2825.1189999999997
uh

2820.66 --> 2825.1189999999997
hello Alaric 87

2827.859 --> 2831.0989999999997
ah

2829.48 --> 2833.56
all right

2831.099 --> 2835.78
well welcome to the early bird show it's

2833.56 --> 2839.619
kind of an unusual show I usually don't

2835.78 --> 2842.619
have like somebody like Dell in my chat

2839.619 --> 2843.94
I will unblock him again it's just I

2842.619 --> 2845.7400000000002
didn't want to sit through that two

2843.94 --> 2847.54
hours straight

2845.74 --> 2850.14
select the first time I think I even

2847.54 --> 2850.14
blocked him

2863.74 --> 2867.9599999999996
who the hell are you talking to moxie

2891.0 --> 2896.22
scared of now no I'm not scared of Dell

2896.26 --> 2900.599
is intellectually inept

2906.099 --> 2910.92
I'm not scared of him at all

2913.06 --> 2920.5
did you run him yeah because he kept ad

2916.24 --> 2922.5989999999997
homing bullshitting me kinda sick of it

2920.5 --> 2925.359
right I've been very polite with him

2922.599 --> 2926.8590000000004
yeah a bit of it in his business yeah up

2925.359 --> 2929.56
in his business getting a bit personal

2926.859 --> 2932.14
bit psychoanalytical

2929.56 --> 2935.2
I mean it's just directly at homing me

2932.14 --> 2938.339
like a [ __ ] like a troll so yeah that's

2935.2 --> 2938.339
what you get then

2939.88 --> 2945.7000000000003
yeah he should know that he knows who I

2943.0 --> 2949.619
am you've seen my shows he's we've been

2945.7 --> 2949.6189999999997
around he's been on my show

2950.02 --> 2955.359
we did a show together like 2016.

2953.43 --> 2956.5
[Music]

2955.359 --> 2958.9
so

2956.5 --> 2961.119
he should know better than to start

2958.9 --> 2964.42
acting like that in my chat because then

2961.119 --> 2966.339
he's gonna get the full analysis

2964.42 --> 2968.26
yeah sure he's triggered because of that

2966.339 --> 2970.24
but I mean if he just keeps on at homing

2968.26 --> 2972.88
like that then yeah I'm not gonna leave

2970.24 --> 2976.06
somebody that's just yelling and saying

2972.88 --> 2978.339
derogatory things in my chat I'm not

2976.06 --> 2980.44
gonna keep that around I kept it around

2978.339 --> 2982.0
for a bit

2980.44 --> 2985.2400000000002
so it's like

2982.0 --> 2987.339
in Vision right it's in there because

2985.24 --> 2989.56
yeah when you ban somebody all the text

2987.339 --> 2992.94
in YouTube gets deleted but it's all

2989.56 --> 2992.94
still on camera there

2993.579 --> 2998.2200000000003
so that there's proof that that actually

2995.859 --> 2998.22
happened

2998.319 --> 3003.72
and just thought like well I have a lot

3000.359 --> 3005.9
of things I can't say about Dell and I

3003.72 --> 3005.8999999999996
did

3011.3 --> 3015.6800000000003
you know awesome skeptic

3015.9 --> 3018.98
let me check that

3026.46 --> 3031.48
thank you thank you very much

3029.52 --> 3034.71
that's awesome

3031.48 --> 3034.71
[Music]

3035.16 --> 3038.5989999999997
very very helpful

3045.0 --> 3052.64
awesome

3047.42 --> 3056.099
man this stupid pop-up thing with the

3052.64 --> 3058.02
this thing is so annoying because it

3056.099 --> 3062.3
always blocks the sentence on the right

3058.02 --> 3062.3
I mean can't you turn that off

3063.0 --> 3065.9
so annoying

3066.18 --> 3071.2999999999997
because it cuts off the last part of the

3068.28 --> 3071.3
sentence every time

3076.98 --> 3081.68
why couldn't they put that button like

3079.26 --> 3081.6800000000003
under

3082.079 --> 3087.54
like

3084.42 --> 3089.16
in the in the box below that at the top

3087.54 --> 3093.2
why didn't they put it there now it's

3089.16 --> 3093.2
blocking a sentence so clunky

3102.119 --> 3105.119
anyway

3111.599 --> 3114.2000000000003
you know

3116.22 --> 3120.95
man you guys

3118.2 --> 3123.98
and that went into full Globe mode

3120.95 --> 3123.98
[Music]

3126.9 --> 3131.339
nah

3129.0 --> 3133.319
he was projecting that on to me though I

3131.339 --> 3135.9
mean I can't believe he actually told me

3133.319 --> 3139.5
that that's like a clover like uh come

3135.9 --> 3143.96
on down that's so pitiful

3139.5 --> 3143.96
that did he was projecting a lot

3148.02 --> 3153.359
but I mean it makes no sense he has no

3150.119 --> 3155.94
reason to to be like that in the face of

3153.359 --> 3158.339
this conception like what is the point

3155.94 --> 3161.7000000000003
why the hell is he even holding on to

3158.339 --> 3164.119
this silly unprovable conception I don't

3161.7 --> 3164.1189999999997
get it

3184.68 --> 3188.2999999999997
yeah hello by the way Nathan

3192.74 --> 3198.18
why is he still toting his claim no

3195.78 --> 3200.8190000000004
natural observed phenomenon

3198.18 --> 3202.98
well

3200.819 --> 3205.44
he's just saying like oh relative

3202.98 --> 3208.26
density doesn't make any sense

3205.44 --> 3210.54
I mean he literally said like what

3208.26 --> 3214.619
so the object is

3210.54 --> 3218.099
just moving like yeah it's just moving

3214.619 --> 3219.839
he just he couldn't get it like yeah

3218.099 --> 3222.7200000000003
an object

3219.839 --> 3227.04
is surrounded by something that's much

3222.72 --> 3229.2
less dense than it yeah ill just move it

3227.04 --> 3231.7799999999997
will just do that and he was thought of

3229.2 --> 3234.4199999999996
like oh my God that's so crazy that's so

3231.78 --> 3237.78
magical like what the [ __ ] is wrong with

3234.42 --> 3240.319
you that is literally what happens

3237.78 --> 3240.3190000000004
like

3241.2 --> 3246.359
I mean that's seriously the point where

3243.3 --> 3249.38
I thought like he's gone [ __ ] insane

3246.359 --> 3249.38
that's just crazy

3250.68 --> 3256.859
why did you think that's magical that's

3252.78 --> 3261.0
Narnia magic like it's a rock

3256.859 --> 3263.7
it's surrounded by air you let it go

3261.0 --> 3268.02
it just starts to move it just does that

3263.7 --> 3271.3999999999996
yeah this provably what happens

3268.02 --> 3271.4
why is that magical

3271.92 --> 3276.359
why it doesn't have to be something

3273.66 --> 3278.54
behind the screens that's doing that for

3276.359 --> 3278.54
you

3279.0 --> 3284.76
why isn't it just doing that

3282.3 --> 3287.28
it's

3284.76 --> 3289.7400000000002
an object it's just at this equilibrium

3287.28 --> 3291.0
with the surrounding it just starts to

3289.74 --> 3293.3999999999996
accelerate

3291.0 --> 3296.339
if it can

3293.4 --> 3298.079
and fall like yeah it just does that

3296.339 --> 3300.0
that's just what happens it's not

3298.079 --> 3305.119
gravity

3300.0 --> 3305.119
yeah it's not the medium is moving

3306.119 --> 3311.28
or in the sense that we can never know

3309.3 --> 3313.02
because you can never what you're going

3311.28 --> 3314.94
to get outside of the medium you're

3313.02 --> 3316.619
gonna go on another reference frame to

3314.94 --> 3319.7400000000002
prove that it's moving or accelerating

3316.619 --> 3321.78
yeah yeah have fun with that

3319.74 --> 3323.819
but I'm pretty sure we're never gonna

3321.78 --> 3326.8190000000004
see you again then right so it's

3323.819 --> 3329.16
unprovable it's no point in pursuing

3326.819 --> 3332.54
that idea

3329.16 --> 3337.0789999999997
you can't prove it like why

3332.54 --> 3340.14
why can't it just be at this equilibrium

3337.079 --> 3342.2400000000002
with the density of its surrounding and

3340.14 --> 3345.1189999999997
then just start to fall because that's

3342.24 --> 3349.7
just what happens what's the problem

3345.119 --> 3349.7000000000003
why is that so magical and crazy

3370.079 --> 3374.94
so many things affect the falling well

3373.079 --> 3378.38
not that many

3374.94 --> 3378.38
but yeah some things

3395.579 --> 3399.48
to our Show starting your Premiere you

3398.22 --> 3401.7
mean

3399.48 --> 3404.2400000000002
all right yeah thanks for popping by

3401.7 --> 3404.24
Nathan

3408.24 --> 3411.24
foreign

3439.319 --> 3447.38
it's not being attracted by magnetism or

3442.98 --> 3447.38
electricity that's ridiculous

3449.28 --> 3454.5
but those forces are actually palpable

3452.099 --> 3456.48
and measurable and that's definitely not

3454.5 --> 3458.52
what's attracting it

3456.48 --> 3461.2400000000002
right because they have a distance

3458.52 --> 3461.24
Factor

3482.22 --> 3486.5
gravity being a G-Force movie

3487.079 --> 3489.6800000000003
what

3495.42 --> 3502.02
what are you talking about gang can

3499.02 --> 3502.02
Langlois

3503.339 --> 3507.74
how about the Spaceballs vacuum thing

3509.7 --> 3516.2599999999998
with Gerald's Game does anybody know

3513.119 --> 3516.26
what he's talking about

3517.64 --> 3521.64
[Music]

3535.02 --> 3540.839
when the world wakes up what shows with

3538.079 --> 3544.2000000000003
it it has nothing to do with it

3540.839 --> 3545.94
the world's already pretty much woken up

3544.2 --> 3547.4399999999996
a lot of it

3545.94 --> 3549.119
moxie

3547.44 --> 3553.44
yeah

3549.119 --> 3555.42
Ryan Cox NDT are not there because the

3553.44 --> 3557.46
Public's not woken up to keep them

3555.42 --> 3559.079
asleep they are there because they are

3557.46 --> 3561.299
paid to do that

3559.079 --> 3564.599
even if everybody's woken up they'll

3561.299 --> 3567.599
still do that I mean look at CNN man

3564.599 --> 3569.88
CNN is still running they're still doing

3567.599 --> 3571.619
all those things they do that they have

3569.88 --> 3574.319
been doing all this time

3571.619 --> 3576.78
and it's like people really know how

3574.319 --> 3578.94
much of a disgusting propaganda Channel

3576.78 --> 3581.579
it really is they're still doing it

3578.94 --> 3585.0
though right because it's not dependent

3581.579 --> 3587.52
on how much people are awakened it's

3585.0 --> 3591.2
dependent on if they're gonna get money

3587.52 --> 3591.2
to roll out that propaganda

3592.559 --> 3597.2400000000002
yeah CNN is a joke of course it's a joke

3594.78 --> 3599.42
but it's still going right it's still

3597.24 --> 3599.4199999999996
running

3602.46 --> 3608.04
right it still gets movie references

3605.22 --> 3610.6189999999997
it's CNN still gets references in in

3608.04 --> 3613.92
Hollywood movies and all that because

3610.619 --> 3615.78
they're paid to be that

3613.92 --> 3618.66
right

3615.78 --> 3623.3590000000004
so yeah Brian Cox NDT

3618.66 --> 3623.359
will be retired I don't think so

3634.859 --> 3640.46
I I don't think they will I think

3637.559 --> 3640.46
they'll just keep going

3645.359 --> 3650.339
right the problem is for them is that

3648.059 --> 3652.7400000000002
they might get paid less when time

3650.339 --> 3654.72
progresses so they might at some point

3652.74 --> 3657.5989999999997
just say like yeah I'm not gonna do this

3654.72 --> 3660.7799999999997
anymore I'm just gonna retire on all

3657.599 --> 3663.48
those however much money they got

3660.78 --> 3664.6800000000003
that they're just using for banking or

3663.48 --> 3666.9
whatever

3664.68 --> 3668.339
and they'll and they will retire because

3666.9 --> 3670.64
it just doesn't make enough money

3668.339 --> 3670.64
anymore

3670.859 --> 3674.94
okay

3672.14 --> 3677.18
but they're not gonna be fired or

3674.94 --> 3677.18
something

3687.96 --> 3692.76
your mom watches oh my God skeptic

3690.96 --> 3695.18
that's so sad

3692.76 --> 3695.1800000000003
God

3708.599 --> 3714.26
believe corruption will stop when the

3711.48 --> 3714.26
force them to stop

3715.079 --> 3718.98
well at some point

3717.119 --> 3721.44
that's interesting

3718.98 --> 3724.68
it's a brief knowing but at some point

3721.44 --> 3726.78
there is a risk that

3724.68 --> 3730.3799999999997
especially if like Flat Earth is

3726.78 --> 3733.98
Declassified or like become

3730.38 --> 3736.02
more out in the open less held back like

3733.98 --> 3740.52
it is now

3736.02 --> 3743.819
that people will eventually like

3740.52 --> 3746.059
eventually they'll get like lawsuits and

3743.819 --> 3746.0589999999997
[ __ ]

3749.7 --> 3753.14
that's what I think will happen

3753.359 --> 3757.5
I mean those guys definitely have a lot

3755.819 --> 3759.42
of dirty things they've been doing in

3757.5 --> 3761.339
their life

3759.42 --> 3763.559
and there will just be people coming

3761.339 --> 3767.099
with lawsuits

3763.559 --> 3769.92
for being lied against and for who knows

3767.099 --> 3770.94
what else probably is creepy sexual

3769.92 --> 3772.92
things

3770.94 --> 3774.9
but like that's probably what's gonna

3772.92 --> 3778.579
get them

3774.9 --> 3778.579
down under eventually

3785.94 --> 3790.2200000000003
because all these guys are all perverts

3796.68 --> 3801.7799999999997
that you can laugh about it but it it's

3798.9 --> 3804.5
literally to it's literally true you

3801.78 --> 3804.5
know the grass

3806.46 --> 3811.859
what's the other guy called

3809.88 --> 3814.92
Bill Nye

3811.859 --> 3817.68
these guys are re they're all perverts

3814.92 --> 3822.02
all these figures that that really get

3817.68 --> 3822.02
the biggest but they're all perverts

3824.22 --> 3827.64
and in that sense they're like part of

3826.02 --> 3829.559
the Hollywood system because Hollywood

3827.64 --> 3832.94
does that [ __ ] too

3829.559 --> 3832.94
with their Superstars

3834.059 --> 3838.98
and yeah you don't even want to know

3836.16 --> 3840.359
what those CNN anchor people get into

3838.98 --> 3843.26
Jesus

3840.359 --> 3843.2599999999998
seriously

3847.5 --> 3853.619
like sexual perverts well and it yeah

3851.16 --> 3855.96
I'm guessing yes

3853.619 --> 3858.9
but I have no

3855.96 --> 3860.88
proof directly

3858.9 --> 3862.7400000000002
I mean I'm not saying like kids or

3860.88 --> 3866.2400000000002
anything but

3862.74 --> 3866.24
I mean just

3867.599 --> 3873.119
I'm just assuming it because when you're

3870.9 --> 3875.1600000000003
up in those higher circles that

3873.119 --> 3877.44
typically is the case

3875.16 --> 3879.839
it's there's this whole thing out there

3877.44 --> 3881.94
it's really [ __ ] up where if you're

3879.839 --> 3885.359
not a pervert

3881.94 --> 3888.2400000000002
if you don't have some extreme deviant

3885.359 --> 3890.7
fetish of some kind they don't even let

3888.24 --> 3892.14
you in they don't let you in with the

3890.7 --> 3894.4199999999996
big crowd

3892.14 --> 3898.859
if you don't like the rape women or

3894.42 --> 3898.859
something or kids or whatever seriously

3900.54 --> 3905.94
it sounds absolutely insane but I think

3903.0 --> 3908.76
that's actually true

3905.94 --> 3910.2000000000003
like I was faced with that [ __ ] when I

3908.76 --> 3912.48
was younger

3910.2 --> 3914.2799999999997
because I had Ambitions it's like oh I

3912.48 --> 3917.54
want to be that number one guy on camera

3914.28 --> 3917.5400000000004
I want to be the cool guy

3917.76 --> 3924.2990000000004
but yeah

3919.98 --> 3927.72
then it started to Gaze on me that

3924.299 --> 3930.619
like they're like they need something

3927.72 --> 3930.6189999999997
over you

3930.96 --> 3935.64
they would always try to pull like

3932.94 --> 3937.5
perversions out of me it's like no I

3935.64 --> 3939.0589999999997
want to be Noble and good and focused

3937.5 --> 3941.339
and like let's build this thing and

3939.059 --> 3943.44
they're like oh how about

3941.339 --> 3945.839
it's like you're like boys or something

3943.44 --> 3949.619
like what the [ __ ] man like

3945.839 --> 3952.2599999999998
ah it's all [ __ ] up Hollywood NASA

3949.619 --> 3954.859
it's all [ __ ] up guys they're all

3952.26 --> 3954.8590000000004
perverts

3967.14 --> 3973.5589999999997
makes me sick thinking back back to that

3970.38 --> 3977.42
like me as a kid and a teen just like

3973.559 --> 3977.42
wanting to be part of that and then

3977.76 --> 3981.599
because I have been in face-to-face

3979.74 --> 3983.3999999999996
situation with some of those types of

3981.599 --> 3987.059
people

3983.4 --> 3987.839
and they would just be like like trying

3987.059 --> 3989.76
to

3987.839 --> 3991.5589999999997
like would literally feel like they'd

3989.76 --> 3994.2200000000003
try to get in my butt or something it's

3991.559 --> 3994.2200000000003
so [ __ ] up

3994.559 --> 4000.02
right I'm there because I'm like yeah a

3997.38 --> 4003.81
space Dreamland let's build spaceships

4000.02 --> 4006.2599999999998
and they're they're like oh look at this

4003.81 --> 4009.02
[Music]

4006.26 --> 4011.48
this little thing that we wanna

4009.02 --> 4014.38
sexually abuse or something like it was

4011.48 --> 4014.38
so [ __ ] up man

4029.14 --> 4034.339
yeah that was a big bummer for me man

4032.0 --> 4036.92
because I I'm one of those kids that

4034.339 --> 4039.859
like I want to be an astronaut it's like

4036.92 --> 4042.38
yeah but what about more

4039.859 --> 4045.619
realistic profession you know I want to

4042.38 --> 4048.44
be a [ __ ] astronaut to Aries like no

4045.619 --> 4051.1400000000003
I really want to be an astronaut like

4048.44 --> 4053.539
I'm serious I'm ready I'm ready for the

4051.14 --> 4055.1189999999997
psychological term and I'm ready

4053.539 --> 4058.4
for

4055.119 --> 4060.319
extremities I'm ready for like you have

4058.4 --> 4062.359
to be ingenious you have to be creative

4060.319 --> 4065.66
under tension like I'm ready for all of

4062.359 --> 4067.339
it and then you find out like yeah

4065.66 --> 4072.0989999999997
or

4067.339 --> 4072.099
it's like are you okay with Satan

4073.099 --> 4075.92
are you gay

4074.78 --> 4078.579
like

4075.92 --> 4078.579
like what the [ __ ]

4097.699 --> 4102.799
and I mean yeah this is all all those

4099.98 --> 4103.9
things were not on camera or something

4102.799 --> 4106.339
right

4103.9 --> 4110.379999999999
face-to-face situation but I mean it's

4106.339 --> 4110.38
still like that's so [ __ ] up

4111.62 --> 4116.0599999999995
and it probably could have damaged me

4114.56 --> 4120.1990000000005
more

4116.06 --> 4124.04
if I wasn't just so into this thing I

4120.199 --> 4125.839
was so like I'm like I'm a space for a

4124.04 --> 4128.0
soldier before there was a space for us

4125.839 --> 4130.2789999999995
like as a little kid I'm like I'm that

4128.0 --> 4133.219
I'm that Soldier you can't defeat me I

4130.279 --> 4136.1
have like infinite motivation

4133.219 --> 4138.14
so that that really like was just

4136.1 --> 4139.759
disappointing to get turned out that

4138.14 --> 4142.819
these guys were creeps and all that I

4139.759 --> 4146.42
wanted you to lie and

4142.819 --> 4149.0
but it was just like my just my infinite

4146.42 --> 4152.0
braveness in the face of it that that

4149.0 --> 4154.699
made me not like collapse under it or

4152.0 --> 4156.62
like I wasn't like Ambitions like no I

4154.699 --> 4159.5599999999995
want to be a special boy I wouldn't be

4156.62 --> 4161.719
anything no I just really wanted to do

4159.56 --> 4163.9400000000005
these things I wanted it to be real and

4161.719 --> 4166.46
then be part of it being real that's

4163.94 --> 4170.0
what I wanted I didn't want to be like

4166.46 --> 4171.7390000000005
the actor that gets all the fame

4170.0 --> 4175.0
even when they're lying that's

4171.739 --> 4175.0
definitely not what I wanted

4175.219 --> 4181.279
I'm sometimes still just so disappointed

4179.359 --> 4183.38
would have been so cool if it was like

4181.279 --> 4185.179
an astronaut guy and would like actually

4183.38 --> 4189.319
be on camera and

4185.179 --> 4189.319
like floating around demonstrating

4189.38 --> 4195.7390000000005
like neutral buoyancy like the neutral I

4192.98 --> 4197.718999999999
would be doing density experiments on

4195.739 --> 4199.4
camera all freaking day long man

4197.719 --> 4203.86
seriously

4199.4 --> 4203.86
I'm still disappointed at that

4204.26 --> 4208.34
because that that's the type of thing

4206.06 --> 4211.719
that I wanted to do like

4208.34 --> 4211.719
most of my childhood

4212.06 --> 4215.080000000001
seem so awesome

4229.82 --> 4238.719
Tom Hanks bad yeah very very bad evil

4235.0 --> 4238.719
really creepy guys

4242.48 --> 4246.5
and it's it's extra weird because she

4244.58 --> 4248.9
can really see it now

4246.5 --> 4251.0
like

4248.9 --> 4252.799999999999
you know first it was like yeah it's

4251.0 --> 4254.78
like this

4252.8 --> 4257.12
kind of guy doesn't have an energy it

4254.78 --> 4259.659
does have a way of doing things

4257.12 --> 4262.88
but now

4259.659 --> 4263.96
you can just look back knowing that all

4262.88 --> 4266.36
these things that we know about

4263.96 --> 4268.58
Hollywood and maybe you looked into some

4266.36 --> 4269.599999999999
of these creepy things that Tom ax was

4268.58 --> 4270.92
into

4269.6 --> 4273.92
and

4270.92 --> 4276.02
you literally like you can now see it

4273.92 --> 4278.54
you can just see that he's actually a

4276.02 --> 4281.92
creepy Grappler under that

4278.54 --> 4281.92
it's really freaky

4284.179 --> 4289.4
like there's no like genuine happiness

4287.179 --> 4292.12
emotion and [ __ ] coming from have you

4289.4 --> 4292.12
ever noticed that

4292.159 --> 4298.159
like in his movies he's not like oh wow

4296.179 --> 4298.9400000000005
that is like like

4298.159 --> 4301.04
um

4298.94 --> 4303.379999999999
where you feel the sun coming out right

4301.04 --> 4306.44
he doesn't have that

4303.38 --> 4309.86
have you ever noticed that that Tom

4306.44 --> 4312.5
Hanks doesn't experience that like not

4309.86 --> 4315.739
even in his acting

4312.5 --> 4318.86
he doesn't have feelings like the sun is

4315.739 --> 4321.799999999999
coming out like that kind of warm

4318.86 --> 4324.88
fuzzy feel he doesn't have that

4321.8 --> 4324.88
can you see it

4330.98 --> 4334.94
when there's like movies that he's in

4333.32 --> 4337.639999999999
that are drama and there's like real

4334.94 --> 4340.159
genuine emotional feelings I mean he

4337.64 --> 4343.1
really like has to like

4340.159 --> 4344.9
form act it he has to like give it a

4343.1 --> 4346.46
form and he's very good at giving it a

4344.9 --> 4349.099999999999
form but

4346.46 --> 4351.199
when you don't listen to what he's how

4349.1 --> 4353.719
he says it you could just feel

4351.199 --> 4356.379999999999
underneath that there is no

4353.719 --> 4356.38
feeling

4362.36 --> 4366.219
guys have you ever noticed that

4373.52 --> 4378.9400000000005
oh great to Just Talk Amongst yourselves

4376.219 --> 4378.94
about whatever

4383.16 --> 4386.41
[Music]

4390.81 --> 4398.2390000000005
[Music]

4395.239 --> 4398.239
foreign

4416.86 --> 4422.5
no that's not true more colored that's

4420.02 --> 4422.5
not true

4424.94 --> 4428.719
no there's there's plenty of actors that

4427.82 --> 4432.08
can

4428.719 --> 4434.719
actually really create the feeling in

4432.08 --> 4438.4
themselves hey you love those actors

4434.719 --> 4438.4
those are really awesome

4444.32 --> 4449.719
right it those are the actors that can

4446.659 --> 4451.0
just stand there and give a look and you

4449.719 --> 4455.0
can feel like

4451.0 --> 4457.6
you can feel it right Tom Hanks not one

4455.0 --> 4457.6
of those guys

4459.08 --> 4465.199
he has to like put more effort into like

4462.5 --> 4466.699
physical motion based expression every

4465.199 --> 4469.04
time

4466.699 --> 4472.12
because it just doesn't really seem to

4469.04 --> 4472.12
have like

4472.159 --> 4478.0
real serious

4474.679 --> 4478.0
feelings on the inside

4488.78 --> 4494.98

4492.8 --> 4494.9800000000005
lot

4495.739 --> 4501.0199999999995

4499.04 --> 4502.64
it's like yeah they're supposed to be

4501.02 --> 4505.3
doing that but it just feels like not

4502.64 --> 4505.3

4721.82 --> 4724.599999999999
y

4728.06 --> 4735.34
no he's not ace

4731.239 --> 4735.339999999999
no he's accelerating out of control

4752.14 --> 4757.9400000000005
so it's almost Ace except there's

4755.54 --> 4758.96
another C and then lyricing out of

4757.94 --> 4762.04
control

4758.96 --> 4762.04
so it was close

4764.89 --> 4768.92
[Music]

4766.76 --> 4770.2390000000005
oh Nathan's premiering the Dell episode

4768.92 --> 4773.8
really

4770.239 --> 4773.799999999999
that's that's hilarious

4777.14 --> 4782.9800000000005
well I guess uh he has something to keep

4779.48 --> 4782.98
busy with then with that

4789.94 --> 4805.629999999999
[Music]

4807.7 --> 4817.619
[Music]

4827.12 --> 4829.9
hey Cleary

4849.08 --> 4853.94
yeah by the way my shows here get so

4851.659 --> 4857.0
much more views

4853.94 --> 4859.4
I do notice that

4857.0 --> 4861.38
so there's just more people watching I

4859.4 --> 4863.42
really wish that they'd also had all

4861.38 --> 4864.92
subscribed to my backup Channel I mean

4863.42 --> 4868.4800000000005
it's literally in the recommendation

4864.92 --> 4868.4800000000005
list it's there for a reason

4870.38 --> 4878.179
but my shows get a decent amount of

4872.42 --> 4878.179
views like 347 351.

4880.28 --> 4883.36
that's pretty good

4886.34 --> 4892.9400000000005
like compared to

4888.739 --> 4892.94
irwinian bear fuse

4893.719 --> 4898.34
where they typically get 170

4898.52 --> 4904.6990000000005
yeah around 170. although my last show

4902.6 --> 4906.4400000000005
did get a lot but I mean that's because

4904.699 --> 4909.5
it's the last show and just like the

4906.44 --> 4913.839999999999
last show before I restarted here that

4909.5 --> 4913.84
one had like gigantic amount of views

4914.719 --> 4920.2390000000005
what is it again

4917.08 --> 4923.36
1.1 K because it the last video just

4920.239 --> 4926.299999999999
keeps building up for some reason

4923.36 --> 4928.54
it is very odd by the way that that

4926.3 --> 4928.54
happens

4929.6 --> 4933.320000000001
like why would everybody watch the last

4932.12 --> 4936.04
video

4933.32 --> 4936.04
so much

4936.679 --> 4941.2390000000005
it's kind of weird

4938.78 --> 4945.08
right but the average amount of views I

4941.239 --> 4947.0599999999995
get on my main channel is a lot higher

4945.08 --> 4949.179
than my backup channel so that's kind of

4947.06 --> 4949.179
cool

4949.46 --> 4954.14
then I'm back

4951.26 --> 4958.159000000001
and it's monetized here although uh yeah

4954.14 --> 4960.1990000000005
I I usually now only get one ad that I

4958.159 --> 4962.12
see when I basically go live with this

4960.199 --> 4965.0599999999995
show

4962.12 --> 4970.179
yep I've clicked on all kinds of videos

4965.06 --> 4970.179
but don't no ads seem to pop up there

4973.699 --> 4976.659
that's kind of weird

4978.46 --> 4983.38
there used to be a lot of them remember

4981.02 --> 4983.38
that

4989.78 --> 4994.4
that are winning bear guy wants to be

4992.3 --> 4996.820000000001
like that's

4994.4 --> 5000.36
kind of a weird

4996.82 --> 5000.36
statement is that

5000.88 --> 5005.52
did you remove the sugar chat option yes

5005.8 --> 5010.719
I want people to PayPal me not send me

5008.62 --> 5013.92
super chats because that's literally I

5010.719 --> 5013.92
don't get anything of it

5021.88 --> 5026.5
I mean

5023.92 --> 5028.84
if my financial situation improves

5026.5 --> 5031.42
dramatically to the point where I'm no

5028.84 --> 5033.88
longer on social welfare well then I

5031.42 --> 5036.52
will turn Super chats back on because

5033.88 --> 5039.28
now I'll suddenly get something out of

5036.52 --> 5041.92
it right that's the difference

5039.28 --> 5044.86
but for me in my position right now it's

5041.92 --> 5046.84
completely pointless to you super chats

5044.86 --> 5049.9
I mean it's like a lot of fun for people

5046.84 --> 5052.719
like Godzilla and all that but it's

5049.9 --> 5055.54
literally wasted for me so that feels

5052.719 --> 5058.42
extra egregious it's like yeah that

5055.54 --> 5062.0199999999995
could have been like 20 bucks in my

5058.42 --> 5065.1990000000005
actual bank within two or three days

5062.02 --> 5068.1990000000005
but now they had fun throwing a Super

5065.199 --> 5071.08
Chat out which sixty percent goes to

5068.199 --> 5072.639999999999
YouTube or something however much that

5071.08 --> 5075.5199999999995
is these days

5072.64 --> 5077.8
and the rest literally like I have to

5075.52 --> 5081.400000000001
pay it back

5077.8 --> 5084.719
to my government so it's totally a waste

5081.4 --> 5084.719
for me to do that

5085.36 --> 5094.679
YouTube is like an ex-wife this is okay

5090.06 --> 5094.679
well as far as I know I'm still married

5105.76 --> 5113.34
but we're sleeping in separate rooms

5107.98 --> 5113.339999999999
except technically we're not but anyway

5114.04 --> 5120.1
GTI for the win yeah I hope so

5117.4 --> 5122.199
it seems to be going great I mean

5120.1 --> 5125.92
seriously

5122.199 --> 5130.719
it is running it's just that day I I

5125.92 --> 5130.719
need money to get this

5131.4 --> 5134.82
usdt thing

5135.04 --> 5141.58
to get an exit point and I'm not gonna

5137.92 --> 5143.92
risk using my food money for that when I

5141.58 --> 5146.0199999999995
don't even know if like there's gonna be

5143.92 --> 5148.54
like an immediate payout or if I have to

5146.02 --> 5150.34
wait for it I don't know that doesn't

5148.54 --> 5153.4
say

5150.34 --> 5155.5
doesn't say how long it'll take

5153.4 --> 5158.159
so I can't risk

5155.5 --> 5158.159
that

5164.8 --> 5171.78
yeah

5167.02 --> 5171.780000000001
oh clammy it's because it's just gift

5173.26 --> 5176.04
that's why

5180.699 --> 5186.94
yeah well the money I get from YouTube

5184.239 --> 5189.959999999999
is that's literally like a corporation

5186.94 --> 5189.96
paying me out

5193.06 --> 5197.620000000001
like I have to report that

5196.48 --> 5201.218999999999
like

5197.62 --> 5204.46
they report that from their side in the

5201.219 --> 5206.56
USA so it's like I I just have to report

5204.46 --> 5209.8
that

5206.56 --> 5212.620000000001
because it is literally a corporate

5209.8 --> 5215.08
income and if I ever get like direct

5212.62 --> 5219.54
money through GTI stuff

5215.08 --> 5219.54
then I will also have to report that

5224.739 --> 5228.9
isn't that a rule you can only get

5226.239 --> 5228.9
Subway yes

5230.86 --> 5236.98
yeah yeah and you can stop talking about

5233.38 --> 5240.179
that now right now

5236.98 --> 5240.178999999999
yeah because

5240.219 --> 5243.78
let me worry about that

5247.97 --> 5253.320000000001
[Music]

5250.48 --> 5257.0199999999995
I'm barely getting by here

5253.32 --> 5259.54
yeah I ask money not because oh I need

5257.02 --> 5262.26
to hoard more no it's literally for my

5259.54 --> 5265.0
[ __ ] food so why don't you stop

5262.26 --> 5267.52
inquiring about that [ __ ] and just give

5265.0 --> 5271.179
me the [ __ ] money

5267.52 --> 5273.6
yeah I don't need any taxation advice I

5271.179 --> 5273.6
need money

5277.719 --> 5285.4
how much of the GTI really uh it depends

5283.12 --> 5288.34
on how much it is

5285.4 --> 5290.5
but it's like yeah it's it would be it

5288.34 --> 5292.06
would fall under like crypto based

5290.5 --> 5294.4
income

5292.06 --> 5295.719
and there is like taxation for that I

5294.4 --> 5297.58
don't know how much it is it could be

5295.719 --> 5300.1
like 30 or something

5297.58 --> 5303.219
but I think it just depends on how much

5300.1 --> 5305.860000000001
it is I mean if I like

5303.219 --> 5307.78
cash like five thousand Euros or

5305.86 --> 5311.199
something well then at first social

5307.78 --> 5314.62
welfare will be canceled probably

5311.199 --> 5317.199
that's that's the problem like before I

5314.62 --> 5320.26
start doing it I need to know with

5317.199 --> 5322.12
absolute certainty that it will keep

5320.26 --> 5324.400000000001
producing

5322.12 --> 5325.78
that it is a stable income that keeps

5324.4 --> 5328.0599999999995
coming out of it

5325.78 --> 5330.4
and it's not just like oh one time score

5328.06 --> 5332.5
and then I'm like it's blocked for years

5330.4 --> 5335.339999999999
like if that were the case then I'm

5332.5 --> 5335.34
totally screwed

5336.219 --> 5340.179
right

5337.54 --> 5342.4
but I mean it depends on the amount if I

5340.179 --> 5344.38
literally get a million dollars out of

5342.4 --> 5346.199
it or something they're probably gonna

5344.38 --> 5350.139
like tax it

5346.199 --> 5352.739
30 to 50 or something

5350.139 --> 5352.7390000000005
a lot

5359.62 --> 5365.0199999999995
right but I mean I'll worry about that

5362.26 --> 5368.679
the the moment where I'm actually about

5365.02 --> 5370.659000000001
to cash it in and then when I do I'll go

5368.679 --> 5373.06
to a Tax Advisor

5370.659 --> 5375.879999999999
and ask them like hey

5373.06 --> 5376.659000000001
I could just I'm new with this what do I

5375.88 --> 5380.02
do

5376.659 --> 5382.5599999999995
how do I work with the tax how do I

5380.02 --> 5382.56
report it

5382.6 --> 5387.360000000001
how should I do this

5384.88 --> 5387.36
right

5389.44 --> 5395.98
and do you take payment in crypto that

5393.699 --> 5398.5599999999995
would also be something that I'd ask

5395.98 --> 5402.5199999999995
like maybe that works better I don't

5398.56 --> 5405.580000000001
know like because crypto is

5402.52 --> 5408.280000000001
yeah it is different from doing business

5405.58 --> 5410.679
using just uh

5408.28 --> 5413.38
actual money

5410.679 --> 5415.36
tax wise it's different and that's why I

5413.38 --> 5417.159000000001
need the advice right and I'll need it

5415.36 --> 5419.86
for this country because I bet it will

5417.159 --> 5421.78
work differently in another country in

5419.86 --> 5424.0599999999995
England and even more different in in

5421.78 --> 5427.12
America so yeah that's

5424.06 --> 5430.56
yeah just leave it to me I

5427.12 --> 5430.5599999999995
I'll know what I'm doing

5438.28 --> 5445.139
how much usdt I need a hundred dollars

5442.84 --> 5445.139
worth

5447.719 --> 5453.96
uh and has to be the uh what's it called

5451.719 --> 5453.96
again

5456.699 --> 5462.0
damn it

5458.02 --> 5462.0
let me scroll back see if I can find it

5466.06 --> 5472.02
been talking with steamy traveler about

5468.58 --> 5472.0199999999995
this on Skype

5472.84 --> 5475.5
come on

5476.56 --> 5483.6990000000005
oh yeah I think it was tetra

5479.98 --> 5488.199
tether tether yeah yeah

5483.699 --> 5488.199
tether usdt trc20

5491.8 --> 5495.900000000001
under the

5493.179 --> 5498.76
like to catch all crypto of trunk

5495.9 --> 5500.739
apparently it's very confusing to me but

5498.76 --> 5505.7390000000005
that's the type there's other types of

5500.739 --> 5505.739
usdt it's that one the the teller

5506.5 --> 5513.719
how much usdt do you need is one billion

5510.94 --> 5513.719
that's hilarious

5516.05 --> 5519.2390000000005
[Music]

5521.679 --> 5527.6990000000005
right but a hundred would surprise more

5524.8 --> 5527.6990000000005
would be great too

5528.28 --> 5531.179
foreign

5532.139 --> 5538.78
use up to a thousand in one go

5535.42 --> 5542.139
right now I could definitely use that

5538.78 --> 5543.639
more would be like super affluent like I

5542.139 --> 5545.9800000000005
wouldn't be able to do anything with it

5543.639 --> 5548.08
other than just cash it in

5545.98 --> 5552.0
but uh

5548.08 --> 5552.0
yeah a minimum of a hundred

5554.199 --> 5561.58
so do you have any do you clammy do you

5558.58 --> 5563.86
even deal in crypto

5561.58 --> 5566.92
that do any of you

5563.86 --> 5569.5
I have no idea it's not like I've been

5566.92 --> 5572.7390000000005
talking a lot about it I'm I've not been

5569.5 --> 5575.98
a crypto Enthusiast exactly I still am

5572.739 --> 5577.718999999999
not really I I'm just kind of using it

5575.98 --> 5579.4
as a cash cow

5577.719 --> 5582.4
that's it

5579.4 --> 5583.879999999999
[Music]

5582.4 --> 5585.46
when

5583.88 --> 5587.92
[Music]

5585.46 --> 5592.0
when you give it I don't give it to you

5587.92 --> 5594.78
at GTI I invested in a system

5592.0 --> 5601.0
that then transforms

5594.78 --> 5602.98
the GTI cryptocurrency into usdt

5601.0 --> 5606.76
so you put

5602.98 --> 5609.759999999999
half usdt in it half the other stuff

5606.76 --> 5612.46
it starts to transform over whatever

5609.76 --> 5615.58
period I don't know and then you get all

5612.46 --> 5618.94
usdt out of it so it literally like

5615.58 --> 5622.92
transmutes GTI currency and usdt and

5618.94 --> 5622.919999999999
usdt is casual

5625.42 --> 5628.7390000000005
or it's yeah

5628.9 --> 5631.62
I think it is

5641.58 --> 5646.719
somebody say something is stupid scroll

[Music]

5756.639 --> 5759.4800000000005
uh

5766.3 --> 5769.7390000000005
hello the brown

5788.8 --> 5792.9400000000005
so you got any more questions I think

5790.78 --> 5795.28
you killed the chat I think that most of

5792.94 --> 5797.98
the guys in the chat really don't they

5795.28 --> 5799.659
are not interested in talking about GTI

5797.98 --> 5802.12
stuff whatsoever

5799.659 --> 5804.28
I guess they all still have this veneer

5802.12 --> 5806.98
of like oh it's a scam it's a scam

5804.28 --> 5809.44
because the internet says it's a scam

5806.98 --> 5811.78
or something or it's crypto I don't

5809.44 --> 5813.159
understand no I don't trust this yeah

5811.78 --> 5816.159
yeah I don't blame you

5813.159 --> 5818.98
what I mean GTI is not like oh you can

5816.159 --> 5821.799999999999
trade this crypto no it's literally

5818.98 --> 5825.099999999999
producing stuff out of nothing you just

5821.8 --> 5827.92
get it it's just a fountain of stuff

5825.1 --> 5830.26
you just get it

5827.92 --> 5833.08
I don't even care how it works really

5830.26 --> 5837.159000000001
it's so elaborate and complicated I

5833.08 --> 5839.679
don't care I just know Kuching money

5837.159 --> 5843.96
comes rolling out it's in crypto form

5839.679 --> 5843.96
you have to trade it somehow

5844.179 --> 5846.96
that's it

5849.28 --> 5855.099999999999
you understand

5850.9 --> 5855.099999999999
for you what transmute

5856.48 --> 5861.5199999999995
okay

5859.06 --> 5865.96
well the system where that's supposed to

5861.52 --> 5870.280000000001
be happening is like a arm

5865.96 --> 5872.44
of the GTI I think it's called My GT

5870.28 --> 5875.759999999999
Exchange

5872.44 --> 5875.759999999999
that's where you do it

5883.48 --> 5886.259999999999
that's it

5887.32 --> 5891.0599999999995
I don't know any more than that

5891.85 --> 5895.029
[Music]

5903.94 --> 5910.379999999999
all right there's here's like this is

5906.1 --> 5910.38

literally

5920.38 --> 5925.12
well you're actually going to lend me a

5922.3 --> 5927.34
thousand usdt wow that is pretty

5925.12 --> 5931.26
incredible clammy if you really want to

5927.34 --> 5931.26
do that that would be amazing

5948.4 --> 5953.679
if you're really serious about this then

5950.26 --> 5956.139
yeah please contact me on Skype

5953.679 --> 5958.36
because I would prefer to give like the

5956.139 --> 5960.4800000000005
data and all that you'd need

5958.36 --> 5964.0599999999995
in a more private setup

5960.48 --> 5967.199
if you know what I mean

5964.06 --> 5967.1990000000005
hey Mark caller

5968.28 --> 5971.7
[Music]

5980.679 --> 5985.96
if jti goes well for me and investment

5983.86 --> 5992.139
bro

5985.96 --> 5996.28
it's baboon but I mean I spent like

5992.139 --> 5998.02
since 2015 building this thing is like a

5996.28 --> 6000.12
computer game it's like oh you collect

5998.02 --> 6002.6990000000005
the stuff or you invest the stuff so you

6000.12 --> 6004.32
get more stuff it's literally like a

6002.699 --> 6006.12
computer game guys it's been like that

6004.32 --> 6008.88
for five years it's been kind of boring

6006.12 --> 6010.62
it was like it was like shut down

6008.88 --> 6011.400000000001
appeared where just nothing would come

6010.62 --> 6014.34
out

6011.4 --> 6017.159
because it like all got [ __ ] up

6014.34 --> 6020.9400000000005
and then they had to fix it it's like

6017.159 --> 6023.58
it's been like this weird surreal robot

6020.94 --> 6026.28
that's just doing this stuff and I don't

6023.58 --> 6028.92
understand it

6026.28 --> 6031.38
I just know that I worked hard on it and

6028.92 --> 6033.84
this stuff comes rolling out and I'm

6031.38 --> 6036.42
really happy because it's like

6033.84 --> 6038.82
it was sort of like my one left field

6036.42 --> 6042.86
ticket to get out of financial Calamity

6038.82 --> 6042.86
and it seems like it's finally working

6043.8 --> 6048.42
read and digest the info okay sure

6047.1 --> 6050.76
glammy

6048.42 --> 6053.58
cool

6050.76 --> 6055.38
nobody gives away free money no no they

6053.58 --> 6057.3
make it

6055.38 --> 6059.76
they make the money

6057.3 --> 6061.92
there's a high frequency trading robot

6059.76 --> 6064.320000000001
underneath all of it that's making money

6061.92 --> 6066.06
from the Forex Market

6064.32 --> 6068.04
which is still going

6066.06 --> 6070.92
it's always going because as long as

6068.04 --> 6073.159
there's trade there is Forex trade like

6070.92 --> 6075.9
that will go away when there's one

6073.159 --> 6078.719
universal one mint

6075.9 --> 6081.36
then that goes away but there is no One

6078.719 --> 6084.0
Singular Universal mint

6081.36 --> 6085.92
there is other mint right because even

6084.0 --> 6087.54
if there was one universal mint there's

6085.92 --> 6091.38
still other currencies so there will be

6087.54 --> 6094.44
a Forex Trading going on so this robot

6091.38 --> 6097.02
is making that money it's just unable to

6094.44 --> 6099.419999999999
let you just cache it because Banks

6097.02 --> 6102.119000000001
refuse to just cash it

6099.42 --> 6105.06
they had trouble with it

6102.119 --> 6107.759999999999
because they all yeah Bankers like we

6105.06 --> 6110.580000000001
don't like you doing that that's our

6107.76 --> 6112.139
thing only Bankers are supposed to be

6110.58 --> 6115.92
able to do that

6112.139 --> 6118.56
that's our trick you're stealing our our

6115.92 --> 6121.619
Banker Guild trick and making it public

6118.56 --> 6125.2390000000005
that's literally what GTI was

6121.619 --> 6128.58
yeah and because of that Guild blockade

6125.239 --> 6131.879999999999
with 100 billion worth of lawyers and

6128.58 --> 6134.58
[ __ ] and and media propaganda

6131.88 --> 6136.7390000000005
and suits and all that crap

6134.58 --> 6140.1
and now everybody calls them a scam

6136.739 --> 6143.339999999999
every gamma online calls them a scam

6140.1 --> 6145.679
scammers that's what they say

6143.34 --> 6148.860000000001
and so they had to transform the the

6145.679 --> 6150.9
[ __ ] it into a crypto system to still be

6148.86 --> 6153.839999999999
it well that money they're making to be

6150.9 --> 6156.42
able to actually get it to cash

6153.84 --> 6158.58
because there is a banker blockade they

6156.42 --> 6160.8
have the money it's in a giant pile

6158.58 --> 6163.139
legally Acquired and they just can't

6160.8 --> 6166.02
cash it

6163.139 --> 6168.4800000000005
they can't do it

6166.02 --> 6170.88
they're being blocked

6168.48 --> 6173.879999999999
right just like

6170.88 --> 6175.56
Owen Benjamin's PayPal like PayPal just

6173.88 --> 6178.38
blocked them right and you think but

6175.56 --> 6180.780000000001
what yeah well that's exactly the thing

6178.38 --> 6182.6990000000005
that happened with GTI except with all

6180.78 --> 6185.94
banks in the world

6182.699 --> 6187.86
it's crazy how big that was they all

6185.94 --> 6189.839999999999
blocked them and they were like

6187.86 --> 6192.179
something back to her like oh yeah you

6189.84 --> 6194.46
will will help you and then they would

6192.179 --> 6197.52
literally like get visits from other

6194.46 --> 6200.159
bankers and like oh yeah we can't do it

6197.52 --> 6201.900000000001
so I bet that people have literally been

6200.159 --> 6205.08
threatened

6201.9 --> 6208.98
like very serious threats like do not

6205.08 --> 6210.96
let GTI cash with you do not do that and

6208.98 --> 6213.239
so they had to create this crypto thing

6210.96 --> 6214.5
to be able to do it and that's the

6213.239 --> 6217.5
background of it

6214.5 --> 6217.5
foreign

6219.98 --> 6224.099999999999
yeah except

6221.88 --> 6228.8
there is a crypto

6224.1 --> 6228.8
that is able to bypass it

6229.92 --> 6233.0
that's the point

6233.28 --> 6238.259999999999
but hey I don't need your investment

6235.619 --> 6241.5
Sally Forth yeah

6238.26 --> 6243.719
to be fair I don't know you

6241.5 --> 6246.179
even if you came to me like hey oh here

6243.719 --> 6249.3
take my 500 euros I want to be part of

6246.179 --> 6250.5
GTI I wouldn't take you yeah

6249.3 --> 6254.58
because

6250.5 --> 6257.0
I don't want some weird random person in

6254.58 --> 6257.0
my network

6261.78 --> 6267.599999999999
I want people that are stable and

6265.02 --> 6270.679
reliable and decent

6267.6 --> 6270.679
as part of my network

6271.139 --> 6275.88
and not random Gammas off the internet

6274.02 --> 6278.34
yeah

6275.88 --> 6280.86
because it's not a pyramid scheme oh

6278.34 --> 6283.92
just grab as many people as you want no

6280.86 --> 6286.44
that's not how it works they don't want

6283.92 --> 6287.82
you to just grab every [ __ ] off the

6286.44 --> 6290.94
street

6287.82 --> 6293.239
they want you to get reliable decent

6290.94 --> 6296.099999999999
people that are not gonna

6293.239 --> 6298.739
[ __ ] all day long

6296.1 --> 6300.659000000001
and turn code you're like oh they were a

6298.739 --> 6302.339999999999
scam all alone I'm gonna sue you with it

6300.659 --> 6305.4
yeah that's what they don't want they

6302.34 --> 6308.159000000001
had enough of that crap

6305.4 --> 6310.92
they want you to get real people that

6308.159 --> 6314.719
are just gonna take it for what it is

6310.92 --> 6314.719
and be fair

6314.94 --> 6321.259999999999
right so I definitely let in somebody

6317.82 --> 6321.259999999999
like steamy Trevor

6322.46 --> 6326.42
or flatter Sage

6326.76 --> 6330.659000000001
right

6329.159 --> 6333.119
Richard G

6330.659 --> 6335.4
I take you because I really I know what

6333.119 --> 6338.54
you're like I know you're really good

6335.4 --> 6338.54
and decent people

6340.98 --> 6343.459999999999
right

6344.28 --> 6348.84
and even if you're like already pretty

6346.56 --> 6351.0
loaded or whatever you can still have

6348.84 --> 6352.679
this on the side it will still just make

6351.0 --> 6354.48
extra and like even if your entire

6352.679 --> 6356.88
business all just breaks down is

6354.48 --> 6359.04
destroyed then this thing

6356.88 --> 6362.58
is still gonna make money

6359.04 --> 6365.04
that's the cool thing about it it's like

6362.58 --> 6366.54
just this fountain on the side it just

6365.04 --> 6369.54
never stops

6366.54 --> 6371.46
sometimes it gets a bit clogged

6369.54 --> 6373.5
it's a bit dried out for a bit and then

6371.46 --> 6374.88
it just go it goes again then oh there

6373.5 --> 6377.58
oh there was a blockage and then it

6374.88 --> 6381.1990000000005
comes gushing out again it's just that's

6377.58 --> 6381.199
what it is that's how our Muse again

6411.78 --> 6417.599999999999
yeah so it's not convenient yeah yeah

6414.84 --> 6421.02
well if you want to be able to withdraw

6417.6 --> 6424.92
huge amounts of cash very quickly

6421.02 --> 6428.1
that just become part of BlackRock yeah

6424.92 --> 6431.58
they get a lot of money very quickly and

6428.1 --> 6434.76
all the access in the world yeah yeah

6431.58 --> 6439.08
the thing is just that well you're gonna

6434.76 --> 6442.139
be instigating mass murder and War and

6439.08 --> 6444.9
mass mutilation and and child organ

6442.139 --> 6448.619
trading then yeah but it'll cash in

6444.9 --> 6450.179
really quickly yes Sally Forth would you

6448.619 --> 6452.339999999999
prefer that

6450.179 --> 6454.86
would you prefer that

6452.34 --> 6456.4800000000005
you'll cash really quickly really easily

6454.86 --> 6459.48
you'll be able to cash your money

6456.48 --> 6462.32
everywhere would you prefer BlackRock

6459.48 --> 6462.32
Vanguard

6470.639 --> 6477.32
have you personally met anybody in real

6473.219 --> 6480.42
life that greatly profited from GTI

6477.32 --> 6482.58
uh yeah

6480.42 --> 6484.08
these guys that got in earlier there's

6482.58 --> 6485.46
been like whole periods where there were

6484.08 --> 6487.679
meetings

6485.46 --> 6492.619
and yeah I met some of these guys that

6487.679 --> 6492.619
were pretty wealthy from it yeah

6496.44 --> 6503.46
[ __ ] yourself

6497.719 --> 6506.34
God damn it I hate this [ __ ] pop-up

6503.46 --> 6510.199
[ __ ] thing

6506.34 --> 6510.1990000000005
I [ __ ] hate it

6512.4 --> 6517.5599999999995
YouTube you [ __ ] broke your chat with

6515.46 --> 6520.5
your stupid [ __ ]

6517.56 --> 6522.719
I can't moderate

6520.5 --> 6525.06
I can't moderate with because this

6522.719 --> 6528.0
[ __ ] thing in the right down Corner

6525.06 --> 6531.56
why did you put that there why isn't it

6528.0 --> 6531.56
two centimeters down

6533.76 --> 6538.76
it's so [ __ ] annoying

6554.34 --> 6560.659000000001
Karen has been in it for years that's

6556.32 --> 6564.36
right yeah and and let me be clear

6560.659 --> 6565.5599999999995
zero initial investment

6564.36 --> 6567.96
yeah

6565.56 --> 6570.2390000000005
so I'll just scrape together my dad made

6567.96 --> 6576.139
an original investment

6570.239 --> 6576.138999999999
what was it then I think it was 50 euros

6581.36 --> 6587.219
was it 500 I'm not sure it was probably

6585.36 --> 6589.139
an initial investment but he's already

6587.219 --> 6590.82
gotten out of that out of it

6589.139 --> 6593.1
a lot

6590.82 --> 6594.84
and so if I gotten things out of it and

6593.1 --> 6596.76
I didn't even have an initial investment

6594.84 --> 6598.92
so

6596.76 --> 6603.360000000001
yeah they're just hating me no they just

6598.92 --> 6607.38
they they like it that I'm poor

6603.36 --> 6610.739
you see if I certainly get like yo I got

6607.38 --> 6613.46
the cashio [ __ ] then they're all like

6610.739 --> 6613.459999999999
yeah

6614.78 --> 6620.0599999999995
burning burning you're a flat earther

6617.58 --> 6622.139
you can't be rich

6620.06 --> 6625.34
it burns us

6622.139 --> 6625.34
yeah that's what happens

6638.1 --> 6640.76
ah

6643.5 --> 6649.08
right

6645.88 --> 6650.9400000000005
[Music]

6649.08 --> 6654.0
but in a way it's kind of funny though

6650.94 --> 6657.0
because I do feel like I've collected

6654.0 --> 6659.82
more of a quality following

6657.0 --> 6661.5
because I required the donations it's

6659.82 --> 6663.299999999999
like

6661.5 --> 6665.88
people that

6663.3 --> 6670.219
are more invested

6665.88 --> 6670.219
in what I do have stuck around

6670.679 --> 6676.1990000000005
because of that if I'd never had any

6673.26 --> 6679.08
money issues then yeah I would have had

6676.199 --> 6680.46
probably a bigger following but it would

6679.08 --> 6683.84
also be

6680.46 --> 6683.84
less loyal I guess

6685.38 --> 6689.58
less personally invested there would

6687.9 --> 6692.638999999999
have been just more shouty people

6689.58 --> 6694.38
alongside of it and I don't really I

6692.639 --> 6696.4800000000005
don't really need that

6694.38 --> 6698.58
I don't want a chat that's just buzzing

6696.48 --> 6701.94
with people just saying random [ __ ] I

6698.58 --> 6703.739
like people that are really involved

6701.94 --> 6706.44
what I'm talking about then when I'm

6703.739 --> 6707.879999999999
talking about something that I can see

6706.44 --> 6710.879999999999
them

6707.88 --> 6714.42
saying things in my chat that directly

6710.88 --> 6716.52
involve what I'm still talking about

6714.42 --> 6720.06
could be an addendum to that information

6716.52 --> 6722.040000000001
I love that I love that effect I like to

6720.06 --> 6724.080000000001
be that guy that does that when I'm in

6722.04 --> 6727.44
other chats when I'm over at Owen

6724.08 --> 6731.28
Benjamin and unauthorized.tv or when I'm

6727.44 --> 6734.04
on a Shiva live stream on YouTube

6731.28 --> 6735.54
I'm that guy I'm listening and then

6734.04 --> 6737.5199999999995
everybody's just blabbering amongst

6735.54 --> 6739.139
themselves but I'm actually listening to

6737.52 --> 6741.360000000001
what is being talked about and then when

6739.139 --> 6744.06
I hear something that triggers a memory

6741.36 --> 6746.46
or an Insight I'm like oh quickly

6744.06 --> 6748.4400000000005
just this piece of information that's

6746.46 --> 6750.119
really informative and that when you

6748.44 --> 6753.0
read it you immediately understand how

6750.119 --> 6757.799999999999
it all connects up I love doing that and

6753.0 --> 6759.96
I love collecting people that do that

6757.8 --> 6764.119000000001
fortunately I haven't really come across

6759.96 --> 6764.119
anybody that's really to that level

6764.159 --> 6769.739
but

6766.08 --> 6773.3
you guys come a long way

6769.739 --> 6773.299999999999
the most of you guys with wrenches

6774.719 --> 6780.06
right

6776.699 --> 6782.239
so I'm really glad of how everything is

6780.06 --> 6782.2390000000005
gone

6784.08 --> 6790.92
you love being on welfare and being poor

6787.92 --> 6793.82
okay alcohol yeah it does actually has

6790.92 --> 6793.82
its advantages

6796.619 --> 6804.0
but

6799.56 --> 6806.76
I mean if you can actually do a job and

6804.0 --> 6809.76
be a professional at it and and grow and

6806.76 --> 6812.9400000000005
even get more income and develop things

6809.76 --> 6814.92
for your job and all that that's even

6812.94 --> 6817.919999999999
better I mean that's definitely better

6814.92 --> 6818.639
than just having a welfare career trust

6817.92 --> 6821.34
me

6818.639 --> 6824.400000000001
I know from X it's not great living from

6821.34 --> 6826.619000000001
it it just gives you like a unique type

6824.4 --> 6828.48
of Freedom that most people actually

6826.619 --> 6831.119
completely waste

6828.48 --> 6832.159
I'm trying to actually make the best of

6831.119 --> 6835.58
it

6832.159 --> 6835.58
with my time

6840.08 --> 6844.5
I was like jumping like oh after round

6842.52 --> 6846.719
out because fed is starting but yeah

6844.5 --> 6848.58
it's Saturday

6846.719 --> 6851.3
so I don't have to

6848.58 --> 6851.3
do that

6855.42 --> 6860.3
how long should people be allowed to

6857.52 --> 6860.3
stay on welfare

6861.42 --> 6865.46
I'm not gonna talk about that

6866.159 --> 6870.96
I mean technically indefinitely it's a

6868.56 --> 6873.119000000001
right it's literally a constitutional

6870.96 --> 6875.88
right in the Netherlands

6873.119 --> 6878.04
and I do not like the idea that that

6875.88 --> 6880.9800000000005
right should be violated

6878.04 --> 6883.86
but yeah I mean if you are literally

6880.98 --> 6885.9
just doing that and then wasting your

6883.86 --> 6887.88
life well you're a pretty weird person

6885.9 --> 6891.299999999999
then because most people that are on

6887.88 --> 6894.06
welfare they don't like it

6891.3 --> 6896.659000000001
they get bored and they feel like a

6894.06 --> 6896.659000000001
piece of [ __ ]

6901.679 --> 6908.4
right yeah yeah and that happened to me

6905.159 --> 6909.239
too like I did try to work when I was a

6908.4 --> 6913.259999999999
teen

6909.239 --> 6916.32
I really did in the early 20s too

6913.26 --> 6919.7390000000005
and it just everywhere I went I would

6916.32 --> 6922.98
like really do my best to really

6919.739 --> 6924.9
be like 300 and even like try to improve

6922.98 --> 6928.58
work circumstances when it was none of

6924.9 --> 6931.44
my business just because I could and

6928.58 --> 6933.659
nobody ever [ __ ] thanked me for

6931.44 --> 6935.58
helping them

6933.659 --> 6938.099999999999
nobody

6935.58 --> 6941.639
is like so [ __ ] up it was just like

6938.1 --> 6943.92
all these people are just here to die

6941.639 --> 6945.84
like they just want to die like what the

6943.92 --> 6948.06
[ __ ] is wrong with this man I don't want

6945.84 --> 6950.400000000001
to be a part I they're not there for

6948.06 --> 6954.0
improvement

6950.4 --> 6958.259999999999
I'm wasting my time doing that job

6954.0 --> 6962.34
a lot of those jobs it sucked

6958.26 --> 6965.58
I think that working at cafeterias

6962.34 --> 6969.06
was probably like the most durable job

6965.58 --> 6972.739
of all because that really did seem like

6969.06 --> 6972.7390000000005
you were fulfilling a function and

6974.82 --> 6978.679
and it was kind of nice to do that

6979.619 --> 6985.38
kind of jobs did you have in the past

6981.719 --> 6990.119
well that a lot of catering

6985.38 --> 6992.82
like uh businesses right like big office

6990.119 --> 6995.159
buildings with a cafeteria I would be

6992.82 --> 6997.5
the guy there

6995.159 --> 7001.94
standing behind the counter giving you

6997.5 --> 7006.199
meatballs all that and

7001.94 --> 7006.199
other than that uh

7009.92 --> 7014.3
it's really the thing that was really

7012.02 --> 7017.119000000001
the thing that I did the most

7014.3 --> 7021.02
but I've done like just stupid packaging

7017.119 --> 7023.659
work that was really boring but doable

7021.02 --> 7025.88
and it didn't pay for [ __ ] so

7023.659 --> 7028.699
but doable

7025.88 --> 7031.82
and I worked for a baker that was kind

7028.699 --> 7034.339999999999
of fun like delivering bread really

7031.82 --> 7036.86
early in a car that was awesome I

7034.34 --> 7040.900000000001
literally played metal and drive like a

7036.86 --> 7040.9
maniac and was very entertaining for me

7042.26 --> 7047.0
but eventually I just it just got really

7045.5 --> 7048.199
tiresome

7047.0 --> 7050.0
because

7048.199 --> 7052.159
it was kind of boring

7050.0 --> 7055.28
other than doing that part

7052.159 --> 7059.179
other than the racing never had a ticket

7055.28 --> 7060.619
by the way I was pretty good with it

7059.179 --> 7063.6990000000005
yeah

7060.619 --> 7063.699
but uh yeah

7064.28 --> 7069.98
then eventually I just thought like this

7066.86 --> 7071.96
is this all sucks like I'll never get

7069.98 --> 7074.419999999999
off the ground like this I'm just gonna

7071.96 --> 7076.04
like find a profession then I tried

7074.42 --> 7077.96
goldsmithing

7076.04 --> 7080.9
because I tried all kinds of education

7077.96 --> 7083.96
so like social worker

7080.9 --> 7088.098999999999
like in the health sector

7083.96 --> 7091.04
uh programming even like oh making

7088.099 --> 7094.46
media technology well that that

7091.04 --> 7095.78
completely all fell on his ass all of

7094.46 --> 7098.179
those tries so then I went for

7095.78 --> 7101.179
goldsmithing that worked out pretty well

7098.179 --> 7104.06
I'm good at it and it's a skill I wanted

7101.179 --> 7106.219
to have I wanted to do that I wanted to

7104.06 --> 7107.659000000001
be able to do it and I did it it made a

7106.219 --> 7110.0
whole bunch of cool things a whole bunch

7107.659 --> 7111.44
of wedding rings and all that made my

7110.0 --> 7112.82
own jewelry

7111.44 --> 7115.04
but

7112.82 --> 7117.619
yeah it's

7115.04 --> 7118.88
it's kind of tough to really get around

7117.619 --> 7121.159
with that

7118.88 --> 7122.78
it's good to have it on the side it's

7121.159 --> 7124.04
like a good craft to have on the side

7122.78 --> 7126.199
but

7124.04 --> 7128.42
I mean if you really want to make a

7126.199 --> 7130.04
living of it you you're you don't have a

7128.42 --> 7132.28
life anyway that's all you're going to

7130.04 --> 7132.28
be doing

7132.86 --> 7138.92
and yeah I've known I've known people

7136.4 --> 7142.28
that do that they were like at the same

7138.92 --> 7144.38
school basically the same

7142.28 --> 7146.48
the same years and all that and they

7144.38 --> 7148.52
would try that and it's like they don't

7146.48 --> 7151.159
have a life they and they still needed

7148.52 --> 7153.8
the job on the side to get by

7151.159 --> 7156.138999999999
I mean it's it's way too hard to do that

7153.8 --> 7157.400000000001
professionally in the Netherlands at

7156.139 --> 7159.32
least

7157.4 --> 7161.5
but it's a great skill to have on the

7159.32 --> 7161.5
side

7162.739 --> 7166.699
right and that's pretty much it that's

7164.659 --> 7170.119
where I left off

7166.699 --> 7172.638999999999
and then I thought like hey

7170.119 --> 7174.86
Flat Earth I want to talk about Flat

7172.639 --> 7176.84
Earth too I got a lot of ideas and

7174.86 --> 7178.759999999999
visions and dreams and skills that I

7176.84 --> 7180.08
want to talk about in social psychology

7178.76 --> 7183.320000000001
and

7180.08 --> 7187.94
I'm gonna become a YouTuber I'm gonna go

7183.32 --> 7191.179
into social life performance

7187.94 --> 7192.98
and so that's the skill that's now my

7191.179 --> 7194.659
profession I mean I am doing it

7192.98 --> 7197.718999999999
professionally yeah I'm not getting by

7194.659 --> 7200.0599999999995
from it I'm still begging for money

7197.719 --> 7201.619
but it is technically the skill that I'm

7200.06 --> 7204.820000000001
developing it's the profession I'm

7201.619 --> 7204.82
engaging with literally

7205.94 --> 7212.799999999999
an engineering profession

7208.88 --> 7212.8
I don't think I'd be that good at it

7215.36 --> 7219.339999999999
I mean it sounds really cool but

7225.619 --> 7231.82
I mean I've never been a real star in in

7228.8 --> 7235.159000000001
Practical electronics and all that

7231.82 --> 7236.96
electrical systems I mean I got an idea

7235.159 --> 7239.179
about it but I mean it's a very

7236.96 --> 7240.86
elaborate field that requires a lot of

7239.179 --> 7242.4800000000005
experience to get it right I don't have

7240.86 --> 7247.0
it

7242.48 --> 7247.0
I'm much more of like a handcraft guy

7250.099 --> 7254.619000000001
that's that's the goldsmithing right

7255.04 --> 7261.5199999999995
engineering is just not

7257.78 --> 7261.5199999999995
not my profession I think

7261.619 --> 7266.54
like I could have chosen that when I was

7264.739 --> 7268.28
younger if I was really kind of pushed

7266.54 --> 7270.739
in that direction but

7268.28 --> 7273.0199999999995
I wasn't

7270.739 --> 7276.04
I was pushed more in the direction of

7273.02 --> 7276.040000000001
the Arts eventually

7280.219 --> 7285.04
by my own choice by the way so

7296.42 --> 7303.4
dude enough with the questions already

7299.06 --> 7303.400000000001
clammy what the hell man

7312.619 --> 7318.46
what the [ __ ] is my fam leave my family

7315.739 --> 7318.459999999999
out of it

7320.98 --> 7324.159
what's up

7325.72 --> 7328.93
[Music]

7331.94 --> 7335.36
dude I already gave you like Ultra

7334.28 --> 7338.84
detail

7335.36 --> 7341.598999999999
this is going a bit far Grammy

7338.84 --> 7343.84
why do what you don't need to know those

7341.599 --> 7343.84
things

7402.86 --> 7410.0
what okay bye trust me what the [ __ ] is

7407.42 --> 7412.46
this [ __ ] yeah nobody in my family

7410.0 --> 7414.639
is Criminal okay

7412.46 --> 7414.639
thank you

7418.4 --> 7422.379999999999
why would you need to know that

7425.659 --> 7429.5599999999995
I mean I've talked about I just think

7427.639 --> 7431.659000000001
it's weird that you're asking all these

7429.56 --> 7433.6990000000005
things yeah I don't have a criminal

7431.659 --> 7437.179
record zero

7433.699 --> 7441.0199999999995
and everybody in my family

7437.179 --> 7442.54
has a zero criminal record yeah absolute

7441.02 --> 7446.4400000000005
zero

7442.54 --> 7446.44
absolute zero

7447.56 --> 7452.02
so what more do you need to know

7460.28 --> 7465.58
don't okay by me okay that's a real

7462.92 --> 7465.58
shitty move

7479.179 --> 7485.599
like what the hell does my consideration

7483.02 --> 7488.360000000001
of an engineering profession have to do

7485.599 --> 7489.92
with why you would potentially invest a

7488.36 --> 7492.199
thousand dollars like what the hell does

7489.92 --> 7494.96
that have to do with any of it

7492.199 --> 7497.36
I don't get it are you just trolling me

7494.96 --> 7499.84
are you just being a real [ __ ]

7497.36 --> 7499.839999999999
bastard

7503.599 --> 7508.219
because if you are I'm never [ __ ]

7505.699 --> 7510.32
forgiving you I will [ __ ] kick you

7508.219 --> 7512.599
out of every [ __ ] chat I come you

7510.32 --> 7516.199
come across okay if that's the case here

just immediately

7602.119 --> 7606.58
kick him out I mean this [ __ ]

7615.98 --> 7621.919999999999
great way to attract investors

7618.619 --> 7624.94
yeah indeed well I don't need investors

7621.92 --> 7624.9400000000005

7625.04 --> 7628.4
in yeah

7626.84 --> 7631.42
donation

7628.4 --> 7631.42
that that's it

7632.599 --> 7636.4400000000005
all right and if someone is going to ask

7634.46 --> 7640.42
me what is the profession of your

7636.44 --> 7640.419999999999
siblings I mean that's a little far

7640.76 --> 7647.4800000000005
not I've already talked about it in the

7643.46 --> 7649.94
open but it's just a little bit too nosy

7647.48 --> 7651.919999999999
if you ask me

7649.94 --> 7654.5
like what the [ __ ] does that have to do

7651.92 --> 7656.3
with anything yeah

7654.5 --> 7658.04
I mean if you're gonna do an investment

7656.3 --> 7660.9800000000005
you want to know about potential

7658.04 --> 7663.44
criminal record [ __ ] like

7660.98 --> 7665.419999999999
could it be suddenly gone do you sudden

7663.44 --> 7668.839999999999
trouble instant Financial instability

7665.42 --> 7671.599
like that right that's relevant yeah not

7668.84 --> 7674.7390000000005
what is their profession

7671.599 --> 7674.7390000000005
that's not relevant

7676.76 --> 7683.0
it just seems invasive to ask that

7680.84 --> 7684.7390000000005
yeah long show today's theme yeah but

7683.0 --> 7688.239
I'm doing a long show because I didn't

7684.739 --> 7688.239
do a show yesterday so

7691.82 --> 7701.08
yeah so I don't need investors I don't

7696.02 --> 7701.080000000001
need investors for GTI okay

7701.599 --> 7708.26
I'm not even gonna try anymore yeah I'm

7705.32 --> 7712.159
not talking about it because I really

7708.26 --> 7713.84
want you in my program and no no I don't

7712.159 --> 7717.199
give a [ __ ]

7713.84 --> 7718.82
okay I don't care for that

7717.199 --> 7724.4
I just wanna

7718.82 --> 7728.9
get my thing ready I don't need you to

7724.4 --> 7734.719
invest in GTI for it to work for me

7728.9 --> 7737.119
I don't need that yeah all I need

7734.719 --> 7740.9
is a bit of this crypto this specific

7737.119 --> 7744.259999999999
crypto so I could unplug the plug hole

7740.9 --> 7745.82
and get the actual cash flow

7744.26 --> 7749.42
that is all

7745.82 --> 7752.78
I don't need other people to become part

7749.42 --> 7755.599
of my GTI Network for me to become

7752.78 --> 7758.3
successful with this it's already

7755.599 --> 7761.0
successful it's already fully built up

7758.3 --> 7762.9800000000005
it's already pretty damn big

7761.0 --> 7766.52
just the way it is

7762.98 --> 7768.138999999999
I don't need others to progress my

7766.52 --> 7771.099
situation

7768.139 --> 7771.099
in that regard

7771.38 --> 7776.900000000001
I mean I'll take you if you really want

7774.5 --> 7779.48
to and I trust you

7776.9 --> 7782.0599999999995
but that's it

7779.48 --> 7784.5199999999995
yeah this is not oh I'm I'm trying to

7782.06 --> 7788.320000000001
trick all these guys to join me no no

7784.52 --> 7788.320000000001
that's not what this is about at all

7796.28 --> 7799.599
yes I know Evie

7801.02 --> 7806.3
I know that's what we talked about but

7803.239 --> 7808.5199999999995
then apparently me objecting to him

7806.3 --> 7812.42
inquiring about the profession of my

7808.52 --> 7816.02
siblings was too far for him okay bye

7812.42 --> 7819.1990000000005
well dude go [ __ ] yourself then

7816.02 --> 7821.84

7819.199 --> 7824.839999999999
you look at me incorrectly yeah I don't

7821.84 --> 7826.639
need a [ __ ] Banker to try to

7824.84 --> 7829.04
manipulate my behavior yeah if you're

7826.639 --> 7832.46
gonna be like that then go [ __ ] yourself

7829.04 --> 7837.34
yeah then I don't need it then I'll just

7832.46 --> 7837.34
wait I'll just wait yeah

7837.86 --> 7841.46
you want to help me out

7839.84 --> 7843.9800000000005
or you don't want to help me out yet

7841.46 --> 7845.84
you're not gonna make me dance like a

7843.98 --> 7848.299999999999
[ __ ] puppet yeah I'm not that

7845.84 --> 7850.28
desperate

7848.3 --> 7853.52
thank you

7850.28 --> 7855.32
help me out or you don't which crypto do

7853.52 --> 7858.46
I need

7855.32 --> 7858.46
it's called tether

7859.28 --> 7863.659
uh

7860.659 --> 7863.659
usdt

7864.92 --> 7869.38
teller usdt what's it called again

7871.34 --> 7878.360000000001
full thing TR

7874.239 --> 7881.44
720 or 30 or something what is it

7878.36 --> 7881.44
I'm gonna scroll back again

7904.48 --> 7911.36
it's Tevin yeah it's from Tron

7908.3 --> 7914.06
but if when you look it up it is called

7911.36 --> 7914.8099999999995
like in the actual programs they call it

7914.06 --> 7917.9490000000005
tether

7914.81 --> 7917.9490000000005
[Music]

7922.639 --> 7929.56
yeah

7923.9 --> 7929.5599999999995
the usdt trc20 that's it

7931.099 --> 7936.139
tether usdt drc20

7938.659 --> 7946.159
and it is like under Tron

7943.04 --> 7949.28
but when you look there's other Tron USD

7946.159 --> 7951.86
T stuff too and that is a different code

7949.28 --> 7953.84
this that's very confused that's why you

7951.86 --> 7956.239
have to actually look for the tether

7953.84 --> 7958.76
usdt

7956.239 --> 7962.419999999999
in the short trc20

7958.76 --> 7965.54
and all of it is under drawn but that's

7962.42 --> 7967.159
not how it's noted when you trade it

7965.54 --> 7968.96
it's not called Tron because there's

7967.159 --> 7970.879999999999
another thing that's just called Tron

7968.96 --> 7973.82
and that's not the one it's not

7970.88 --> 7977.32
confusing at all yes it is

7973.82 --> 7977.32
you got to get the right one

8002.92 --> 8007.619
all right I'm gonna take a two minute

8004.54 --> 8007.619
break I'll put you right back

8085.599 --> 8087.78
thank you

8107.86 --> 8110.94
and I'm back

8115.659 --> 8121.299999999999
how do I do standard

8117.82 --> 8124.48
to get to the gtf

8121.3 --> 8126.639
how do you use it

8124.48 --> 8130.178999999999
I don't know if you put it in the

8126.639 --> 8133.179
machine together with the GTI and then

8130.179 --> 8139.659
pure tether comes out

8133.179 --> 8141.2390000000005
yeah 50 GTI 50 tether 100 G tether comes

8139.659 --> 8144.46
out that's it

8141.239 --> 8146.44
I don't know why stop asking me those

8144.46 --> 8147.76
stupid questions I how the [ __ ] should I

8146.44 --> 8150.54
know

8147.76 --> 8150.54
laughs

8160.0 --> 8164.699
that's right steamy travel that's

8161.739 --> 8164.699
exactly what it is

8171.159 --> 8179.219
looking on your crypto app okay AV

8175.36 --> 8179.219
cool I didn't know you were into that

8185.079 --> 8187.619
hmm

8224.439 --> 8231.639000000001
right anyway yeah I'll leave it

8228.519 --> 8235.479
anybody can help out that would be great

8231.639 --> 8238.899
but I mean do then if you can or you

8235.479 --> 8241.779999999999
want to please contact me over on Skype

8238.899 --> 8244.059
it's it's better that way then I can

8241.78 --> 8246.42
just like give you like wallet data and

8244.059 --> 8246.42
all that

8246.46 --> 8249.098999999998
I don't want to throw it in the chat

8248.139 --> 8251.199999999999
here

8249.099 --> 8252.519
don't even know if it would fit but I

8251.2 --> 8255.0
don't want to just throw it out there

8252.519 --> 8255.0
like that

8257.559 --> 8260.58
thank you

8270.639 --> 8277.119999999999
right but yeah I'm like ready to do it

8273.88 --> 8281.018999999998
there's already a thousand

8277.12 --> 8284.979000000001
euros worth of GT Plus

8281.019 --> 8287.019
ready to go to transform

8284.979 --> 8289.119999999999
and there's more where that came from I

8287.019 --> 8291.04
mean like yesterday like another 100

8289.12 --> 8293.859
euros worth of

8291.04 --> 8296.080000000002
GT plus just like got dumped in my

8293.859 --> 8298.559000000001
wallet so it's just like it it just

8296.08 --> 8298.559
keeps coming

8299.559 --> 8303.938999999998
then it's like boom one day oh it's only

8302.08 --> 8305.679
2 50 and then next day oh it's like the

8303.939 --> 8309.059000000001
years 200 Euros

8305.679 --> 8309.059
oh okay

8309.099 --> 8317.5
I don't get it but I mean it's a lot

8313.719 --> 8320.38
but it's pretty much what comes out

8317.5 --> 8322.54
a little irregular it's not it's not

8320.38 --> 8324.699999999999
like it's the stable amount that keeps

8322.54 --> 8327.28
coming out it's like suddenly suddenly

8324.7 --> 8330.059000000001
like a big amount comes out and then a

8327.28 --> 8333.399000000001
whole while nothing

8330.059 --> 8337.0
but the amount that does roll out is

8333.399 --> 8338.74
proportional though

8337.0 --> 8343.8
because I have a lot of mechanism

8338.74 --> 8343.8
invested within GTI so

8351.359 --> 8356.2
excuse me

8353.25 --> 8358.78
[Music]

8356.2 --> 8362.28
when I want to talk about it

8358.78 --> 8362.28
I've never had it before

8372.78 --> 8377.74
if my finances improve will I stay new

8376.0 --> 8382.479
track

8377.74 --> 8384.96
yeah I well I'm not gonna go away just

8382.479 --> 8384.96
like that

8386.62 --> 8390.84
I mean I've grown to kind of like it

8388.66 --> 8390.84
here

8394.12 --> 8399.54
and I really I like this location I

8396.58 --> 8399.539999999999
don't just want to go

8399.76 --> 8405.399
I'm not gonna buy an island

8402.939 --> 8407.76
it's ridiculous I'm never gonna get to

8405.399 --> 8407.76
that point

8413.38 --> 8420.599999999999
the GTI doesn't pay out Millions a week

8417.22 --> 8420.599999999999
this doesn't happen

8423.76 --> 8429.399
or at least that's not where I'm at

8426.28 --> 8431.979000000001
there might be people in the system like

8429.399 --> 8434.019999999999
Saudi Arabians that is like oh yeah just

8431.979 --> 8436.0
give me one billion

8434.02 --> 8439.24
I'll just invest a billion in this

8436.0 --> 8443.62
account okay they might get a million

8439.24 --> 8446.14
out fit every week but I am not in that

8443.62 --> 8449.08
position and I'm not gonna be in that

8446.14 --> 8452.16
position I'm pretty confident of that

8449.08 --> 8452.16
that would be crazy

8452.8 --> 8456.039999999999
right and I don't need an island what

8454.96 --> 8458.199999999999
the hell am I going to do with an island

8456.04 --> 8460.859
it's just going to be very very alone on

8458.2 --> 8460.859
a freaking Island

8460.96 --> 8464.88
no I like to stay here

8465.52 --> 8472.300000000001
and see this revolution thing that's

8469.359 --> 8473.74
probably gonna happen soon through

8472.3 --> 8475.779999999999
just

8473.74 --> 8478.359
just be here when

8475.78 --> 8480.460000000001
when The Purge happens when Netherlands

8478.359 --> 8485.76
is gonna finally

8480.46 --> 8485.759999999998
sweat out this disease government

8486.7 --> 8490.42
that that might be very soon by the way

8488.68 --> 8493.14
I don't know

8490.42 --> 8493.14
probably

8494.439 --> 8500.34
but yeah I think I'll stay here

8497.62 --> 8500.34
for a bit

8500.56 --> 8504.76
less some dude if I could get to the

8503.08 --> 8507.22
point where I could actually afford a

8504.76 --> 8510.399
house or something there's some really

8507.22 --> 8512.979
beautiful houses here in new track so

8510.399 --> 8515.74
although I just I kind of like this

8512.979 --> 8518.14
place I like this

8515.74 --> 8519.819
I like this specific apartment I wish I

8518.14 --> 8523.92
had had more room

8519.819 --> 8523.92
but I like this this spot

8525.78 --> 8533.220000000001
you hope it's a peaceful Purge

8529.0 --> 8533.22
it probably will be mostly

8535.96 --> 8539.14
might get a bit hard-handed here and

8538.06 --> 8541.96
there

8539.14 --> 8544.3
but it is probably gonna remain peaceful

8541.96 --> 8546.66
except for some beatings and that kind

8544.3 --> 8546.66
of [ __ ]

8547.18 --> 8550.84
yeah

8548.56 --> 8553.74
that's usually you get Beauty so it's

8550.84 --> 8553.74
very hard to avoid

8555.7 --> 8561.16
and when it is a peace form

8558.16 --> 8561.16
uh

8562.78 --> 8568.140000000001
ice definitely

8565.66 --> 8568.14
what

8576.58 --> 8581.8
is definitely moved to Europe if I had

8579.7 --> 8586.439
that kind of money

8581.8 --> 8586.438999999998
is is you gonna move to Europe

8591.399 --> 8595.84
Jesus comes back to yeah I wouldn't

8593.68 --> 8598.06
count on it

8595.84 --> 8601.439
but I think Jesus is coming through us

8598.06 --> 8601.439
through our knowledge

8601.96 --> 8611.46
by understanding him and doing it

8606.04 --> 8611.460000000001
we make him return through us

8614.56 --> 8617.58
that's what I believe

8631.359 --> 8639.76
right I don't think that we need to like

8634.78 --> 8642.880000000001
don't wait for some figure to certainly

8639.76 --> 8644.859
we're not it's not gonna help a figure

8642.88 --> 8647.46
out of nowhere is not gonna help it's

8644.859 --> 8650.56
only gonna take everybody

8647.46 --> 8653.019999999999
has to be that figure you have to be

8650.56 --> 8656.14
that figure

8653.02 --> 8658.6
like you have to be the Christ I have to

8656.14 --> 8662.8
be the Christ we all do as many as

8658.6 --> 8666.84
possible that's how he returns

8662.8 --> 8666.84
we just have to do it

8668.5 --> 8673.8
right

8670.54 --> 8678.0
and if we do it well enough then the the

8673.8 --> 8678.0
it should be more peaceful

8683.38 --> 8687.099999999999
you're more of a literalist yeah well

8685.479 --> 8688.779999999999
there's a lot of problem with that Mark

8687.1 --> 8691.06
colored I mean you haven't been really

8688.78 --> 8694.359
hanging around recently I think

8691.06 --> 8697.0
there's I have all kinds of very

8694.359 --> 8700.319
different views on the Bible

8697.0 --> 8700.319
very very different

8702.7 --> 8706.359
Jesus would be locked up and calm insane

8705.22 --> 8710.099999999999
these days

8706.359 --> 8710.1
no I don't think so

8710.319 --> 8716.819
I'm sorry since when do people get

8712.54 --> 8716.819000000001
locked up for being insane these days

8717.939 --> 8723.819
hello us you do realize we're like post

8721.359 --> 8726.640000000001
2020 right

8723.819 --> 8729.22
I mean if you'd say like the 90s or

8726.64 --> 8731.08
something I'd be like yeah probably Now

8729.22 --> 8734.979
do

8731.08 --> 8737.14
the craziest ass people and overt

8734.979 --> 8742.358999999999
assaulters and

8737.14 --> 8744.099999999999
sexual violators just walk in the street

8742.359 --> 8747.42
they don't get locked up they often

8744.1 --> 8747.42
don't even get charged

8747.58 --> 8750.18
okay

8751.319 --> 8757.14
people don't get locked up for being

8755.02 --> 8760.54
insane us

8757.14 --> 8761.74
that's the new deal that's where we're

8760.54 --> 8763.899000000001
at

8761.74 --> 8768.6
people don't get locked up for being

8763.899 --> 8768.599999999999
insane that's part of the big problem

8769.6 --> 8775.66
so if Jesus would return no he wouldn't

8772.0 --> 8779.859
be called insane and locked up no he'd

8775.66 --> 8779.859
just be like oh okay sure

8780.76 --> 8786.7
okay your Jesus okay fine

8783.64 --> 8788.979
go ahead do some Miracles can you help

8786.7 --> 8791.26
us out here like I mean they're not

8788.979 --> 8793.179999999998
gonna be oh you dare to say that you

8791.26 --> 8795.460000000001
must be crazy they're like oh no welcome

8793.18 --> 8797.02
to the club and like oh well at least

8795.46 --> 8799.419999999998
your insanity is a little bit more

8797.02 --> 8801.899000000001
benevolent that's how it would be

8799.42 --> 8801.899
regarded

8803.319 --> 8809.019999999999
we're not in the 20th century anymore us

8806.979 --> 8811.438999999998
people don't get locked up for being

8809.02 --> 8811.439
insane

8821.38 --> 8826.5
right exactly

8823.18 --> 8826.5
Mark color gets it

8829.54 --> 8834.399000000001
and I mean even the 20th century most of

8831.88 --> 8836.38
it they didn't even do that

8834.399 --> 8838.599999999999
was like that was much more like the

8836.38 --> 8841.599999999999
19th century they did that you you you

8838.6 --> 8842.5
talk out of line you go crazy you go in

8841.6 --> 8845.319
uh

8842.5 --> 8846.58
and the asylum

8845.319 --> 8848.74
I mean

8846.58 --> 8849.52
right they did it much more easily back

8848.74 --> 8851.5
then

8849.52 --> 8853.899000000001
20th century was still a little bit

8851.5 --> 8856.74
around but then like halfway it really

8853.899 --> 8856.74
kind of stopped

8858.64 --> 8864.039999999999
I'd say it was a pretty good balance

8860.74 --> 8868.06
like in the 90s and the 80s

8864.04 --> 8871.080000000002
and then yeah 21st century happened and

8868.06 --> 8873.88
now it's all [ __ ] it's like the

8871.08 --> 8876.939
normalization of insanity quite

8873.88 --> 8879.42
literally in many many ways

8876.939 --> 8879.42
many many

8880.3 --> 8883.438999999998
as you all know

8891.7 --> 8898.380000000001
we'll take a miracle to get rid of these

8894.04 --> 8898.380000000001
goons in control no not really

8901.6 --> 8908.02
it just takes a couple of guys and some

8904.54 --> 8910.62
butcher knives and clubs that should do

8908.02 --> 8910.62
it just fine

8915.76 --> 8920.439
problem is it's like it has to be kind

8918.64 --> 8922.96
of coordinate you can't just do it with

8920.439 --> 8924.939
against one politician then I expect it

8922.96 --> 8929.759999999998
to be over no

8924.939 --> 8929.76
it's gonna be a pretty large scale

8931.3 --> 8936.06
you gotta be prepared ahead of time

8936.28 --> 8942.12
you gotta unroll it all at once or it's

8939.58 --> 8942.12
not gonna work

8943.54 --> 8945.720000000001
thank you

8973.54 --> 8978.399000000001
guys the institutions were shut down due

8976.18 --> 8981.24
to mystery motivation yeah

8978.399 --> 8981.24
shut down

8981.28 --> 8984.18
that's correct

8986.14 --> 8991.24
then they did all kinds of insane things

8988.66 --> 8993.16
like electroshock therapy and all that

8991.24 --> 8994.5
and

8993.16 --> 8997.0
dude

8994.5 --> 8999.7
lobotomization I mean there was some

8997.0 --> 9002.359
really crazy experiments going on with

8999.7 --> 9002.359
insane people

9004.439 --> 9009.14
and it often made it a lot worse

9009.479 --> 9014.64
like yay we have to do this procedure so

9012.18 --> 9017.04
you would either like become even worse

9014.64 --> 9018.84
or you'd turn into a freaking zombie

9017.04 --> 9019.92
that's just not a person anymore I mean

9018.84 --> 9022.02
that's

9019.92 --> 9024.42
that's the [ __ ] that happened in the

9022.02 --> 9027.24
19th century a lot

9024.42 --> 9030.74
and still little into the 20th

9027.24 --> 9030.74
but most of that stopped

9030.96 --> 9033.919999999998
at the end of it

9036.24 --> 9040.02
all those buildings looks like crosses

9038.1 --> 9041.52
from above yeah and most of them are

9040.02 --> 9044.640000000001
cursed

9041.52 --> 9047.28
seriously although it's just silence

9044.64 --> 9048.42
well like almost all of them are just

9047.28 --> 9052.439
cursed

9048.42 --> 9055.26
like spooky ass like you get there you

9052.439 --> 9057.960000000001
feel all like oh my God this is so wrong

9055.26 --> 9060.24
it feels like it's a torture chamber

9057.96 --> 9062.16
most of those old asylums they feel like

9060.24 --> 9066.72
torture chambers

9062.16 --> 9070.14
yeah really really bad energy stale

9066.72 --> 9073.039999999999
sickening suppressed

9070.14 --> 9073.039999999999
really bad

9073.62 --> 9081.979000000001
like I feel that palpably when I'm

9077.1 --> 9081.979000000001
yeah when I'm near that I can feel it

9083.16 --> 9088.92
because it was deranged I mean the way

9085.859 --> 9091.819
they treated people was inhuman it was

9088.92 --> 9091.819
very inhuman

9092.819 --> 9096.84
right and even if the person can't

9095.16 --> 9098.819
properly Express themselves anymore

9096.84 --> 9101.1
because they're brain damaged or they're

9098.819 --> 9103.5
deranged that doesn't mean that they

9101.1 --> 9105.18
don't underneath all that have feelings

9103.5 --> 9106.5
that keep record

9105.18 --> 9108.359
right

9106.5 --> 9110.939
so if you're going to keep trade treat

9108.359 --> 9113.1
people like animals because they can't

9110.939 --> 9114.78
properly Express themselves but they

9113.1 --> 9117.18
still have feelings and intelligence

9114.78 --> 9119.52
underneath yeah that's torture

9117.18 --> 9121.859
that's torture nobody's stopping it and

9119.52 --> 9123.6
that's gonna rub off on the energy of

9121.859 --> 9125.58
that place

9123.6 --> 9128.28
and that happened a lot

9125.58 --> 9130.56
right people declared insane because

9128.28 --> 9132.300000000001
they lose control but they still are

9130.56 --> 9133.92
people with feelings underneath there

9132.3 --> 9138.56
and they're gonna go through hell there

9133.92 --> 9138.56
and that's gonna curse that place

9142.319 --> 9147.119999999999
or did they think there was effective

9143.88 --> 9149.938999999998
treatment well because they'd stop being

9147.12 --> 9152.34
[ __ ] that's why

9149.939 --> 9155.460000000001
yeah it's just like make them stop being

9152.34 --> 9158.22
[ __ ] okay we'll do this and then like

9155.46 --> 9160.679999999998
oh

9158.22 --> 9164.279999999999
treatment successful they're no longer

9160.68 --> 9166.68
spazzing out all the time yeah

9164.28 --> 9168.42
could have just given them some CBD oil

9166.68 --> 9171.0
that would have also done the trick and

9168.42 --> 9174.859
they'd still be a person but yeah they

9171.0 --> 9174.859
they didn't do that like that

9183.24 --> 9190.74
yeah that's right yeah it's as I said

9186.72 --> 9193.74
yeah it's like still Midway 20th century

9190.74 --> 9198.72
but I mean after the after half it

9193.74 --> 9198.72
really did like seriously decrease

9204.3 --> 9208.46
I thought of a lot of bad but yeah

9209.76 --> 9212.76
anyways

9215.28 --> 9220.140000000001
right but it really was look flightless

9217.68 --> 9221.34
H why did they do those things it's

9220.14 --> 9224.939
because

9221.34 --> 9227.460000000001
they weren't treated like patients that

9224.939 --> 9229.7
would heal right it wasn't like a

9227.46 --> 9229.699999999999
hospital

9229.76 --> 9238.08
asylums were not Mental Hospitals they

9233.88 --> 9243.72
were not there to really help somebody

9238.08 --> 9243.72
out of their ailment they were there to

9243.979 --> 9249.72
make those people stop being a bother to

9248.52 --> 9252.42
society

9249.72 --> 9255.599999999999
that was the approach

9252.42 --> 9258.479
right not to heal them but to ensure

9255.6 --> 9259.74
that they'd stop being a drain or a

9258.479 --> 9261.539999999999
burden

9259.74 --> 9264.539999999999
and yeah

9261.54 --> 9266.580000000002
then just lobotomizing somebody and

9264.54 --> 9270.060000000001
making them much less

9266.58 --> 9272.46
[ __ ] and all that yeah seems like a

9270.06 --> 9274.439
solution from that perspective because

9272.46 --> 9277.679999999998
they don't care about the patient it

9274.439 --> 9280.62
wasn't in the part of of the

9277.68 --> 9282.78
of the priorities it's just like how do

9280.62 --> 9285.0
we get rid of them how do we make them

9282.78 --> 9288.800000000001
stop bothering like that stops drawing

9285.0 --> 9288.8
attention stops unnerving people

9289.319 --> 9292.16
and that's it

9292.8 --> 9297.179999999998
was much more like a prison in that

9294.96 --> 9300.358999999999
sense like how do we just

9297.18 --> 9303.06
isolate them it was really like a mental

9300.359 --> 9304.319
prison a mental prison would have been a

9303.06 --> 9309.019999999999
better

9304.319 --> 9309.019999999999
more accurate work for it what it was

9334.979 --> 9340.679
foreign

9336.37 --> 9340.679
[Music]

9348.07 --> 9353.36
[Music]

9366.8 --> 9371.3
even see Moxie oh wait there

9388.56 --> 9391.859
right

9390.12 --> 9394.26
but I mean yeah I'm kind of curious

9391.859 --> 9397.62
Rufus Saint hobbins asked you a question

9394.26 --> 9400.04
Evie are you gonna help me out

9397.62 --> 9400.04
okay

9400.26 --> 9403.939
are you capable of doing that

9420.899 --> 9423.06
I hope how

9422.28 --> 9426.54
uh

9423.06 --> 9428.819
well sending me usdt

9426.54 --> 9430.740000000002
either as a gift or as a loan or

9428.819 --> 9432.84
something

9430.74 --> 9433.92
right that was the point I just need a

9432.84 --> 9437.52
hundred

9433.92 --> 9440.04
I could take up to a thousand

9437.52 --> 9444.359
but I need a minimum of 100 and then I

9440.04 --> 9445.92
can start transforming this GTI stuff

9444.359 --> 9449.66
into it

9445.92 --> 9449.66
into the usdts

9450.0 --> 9453.859
did you quit smoking

9458.399 --> 9463.519999999999
no I did not quit smoking cannabis but

9467.52 --> 9472.28
no I like it just fine if you have the

9469.859 --> 9472.28
right kind

9473.64 --> 9476.24
foreign

9478.859 --> 9484.62
don't have the money for it I've also

9481.08 --> 9487.62
considered going into like CBD oil just

9484.62 --> 9490.740000000002
to see if that would make me

9487.62 --> 9493.319000000001
want to smoke less

9490.74 --> 9494.939
but I mean I don't have money for that

9493.319 --> 9496.5
kind of investment it's kind of

9494.939 --> 9498.24
expensive

9496.5 --> 9500.479
if you actually want to get some good

9498.24 --> 9500.479
stuff

9502.5 --> 9507.84
like all the strains yeah I know what

9504.6 --> 9512.16
you mean more colored but it all depends

9507.84 --> 9515.22
on the on the grower right now we got

9512.16 --> 9516.899
some really good Growers here or I know

9515.22 --> 9519.539999999999
the coffee shop that I typically go to

9516.899 --> 9522.66
has some really good Growers like they

9519.54 --> 9525.060000000001
have like exactly what I need it's not

9522.66 --> 9526.74
Super Hyper American strong although

9525.06 --> 9529.74
they do have those

9526.74 --> 9531.899
but that's not the typical

9529.74 --> 9534.06
you have just really good quality that's

9531.899 --> 9537.119999999999
not too strong but it's just very

9534.06 --> 9538.979
pleasant and nice tasting Etc you just

9537.12 --> 9541.979000000001
gotta know you gotta know where to find

9538.979 --> 9545.16
it and since there is just a lot of

9541.979 --> 9546.84
cannabis everywhere here

9545.16 --> 9549.319
yeah you just gotta find the right

9546.84 --> 9549.319
source

9552.54 --> 9556.460000000001
oh you are a grower okay cool

then I could just give you my wallet

9611.34 --> 9618.439
data and you can send it and yeah

9614.64 --> 9618.439
tell me your conditions and everything

9664.72 --> 9671.179999999998
[Music]

9666.8 --> 9671.179999999998
so what will it be Evie

9672.24 --> 9677.479
what do you want to think about it or

9673.859 --> 9677.479000000001
something uh whatever

9677.88 --> 9682.8
but they don't necessarily need a

9680.58 --> 9686.539999999999
thousand all the way I mean a hundred

9682.8 --> 9686.539999999999
would also do

9687.479 --> 9693.74
but yeah if I got a thousand it would

9690.0 --> 9693.74
just roll out quicker that's all

9709.8 --> 9715.64
I hear higher Tac yeah more call it but

9712.439 --> 9715.64
it's terrible that stuff

9716.04 --> 9721.5
I don't like the super high THC we I

9719.16 --> 9724.08
don't like it at all

9721.5 --> 9728.76
it's like an assault on your brain it's

9724.08 --> 9731.399
just not good like and that's not really

9728.76 --> 9733.26
healing anything either I think when

9731.399 --> 9734.64
that happens when you stroke the really

9733.26 --> 9737.52
strong stuff

9734.64 --> 9740.039999999999
it doesn't actually like it's just too

9737.52 --> 9743.12
weaponized it doesn't properly heal your

9740.04 --> 9743.12
body anymore I think

9743.819 --> 9747.539999999999
there are a lot more than urgent to come

9746.399 --> 9749.819
up

9747.54 --> 9752.7
well at first there's just two thousands

9749.819 --> 9755.1
gonna come out similar

9752.7 --> 9758.1
sandpaper

9755.1 --> 9761.220000000001
but then yeah I can I can give the

9758.1 --> 9765.56
Thousand back and use the Thousand that

9761.22 --> 9765.56
I got left for well keep doing that

9767.3 --> 9772.8
how come I've never just bought tether

9769.8 --> 9775.759999999998
uh because I needed food

9772.8 --> 9775.759999999998
AV

9776.22 --> 9783.858999999999
I because I did it's a lot of money and

9780.18 --> 9783.859
I'm really like

9784.2 --> 9788.939
yeah

9786.12 --> 9791.160000000002
food first yes

9788.939 --> 9793.2
and by the way this situation hasn't

9791.16 --> 9795.3
really arrived that long yet I'm it's

9793.2 --> 9797.460000000001
like there for two weeks

9795.3 --> 9800.938999999998
I've got this set up ready to go for

9797.46 --> 9805.399
like two weeks now that's it

9800.939 --> 9805.399
so it just only recently came up

9810.18 --> 9815.720000000001
or is it even two is it just one week I

9812.34 --> 9815.72
don't even know how long has this been

9818.939 --> 9824.54
just let's just say two weeks

9822.06 --> 9824.539999999999
right

9833.64 --> 9837.899
don't really know me well I'm right here

9836.34 --> 9840.84
I mean

9837.899 --> 9844.819
you should be able to know me I have a

9840.84 --> 9844.819
Daily Show I've been doing this for

9845.819 --> 9848.66
seven years

9850.439 --> 9855.479000000001
I mean

9852.12 --> 9858.140000000001
I'm a very public figure

9855.479 --> 9858.14
like that

9867.72 --> 9872.519999999999
and what's the risk what's the risk you

9870.0 --> 9875.24
expect do you expect that I I'll not

9872.52 --> 9875.24
give it back

9875.819 --> 9882.5
or that I'll lose it somehow

9878.7 --> 9882.5
like how the hell would that even happen

9891.0 --> 9896.399
yeah

9892.8 --> 9900.06
whatever does it then look unlock the

9896.399 --> 9902.76
GTI well no it helps me it's the fuel to

9900.06 --> 9905.16
help me transform the GTI cryptocurrency

9902.76 --> 9908.52
into more tether so you give me a

9905.16 --> 9912.96
thousand I add a thousand GTI currency

9908.52 --> 9914.58
it goes processing and then 2 000 tether

9912.96 --> 9917.72
comes out

9914.58 --> 9917.72
that's how it works

9928.2 --> 9934.26
and then I can give it back and keep the

9931.439 --> 9936.42
other thousand and keep going keep going

9934.26 --> 9939.56
and transforming the GTI currency that's

9936.42 --> 9939.56
what I'm gonna do with it

9947.399 --> 9950.399
right

9953.58 --> 9956.359
using

9956.819 --> 9961.49
this program

9959.46 --> 9964.559
foreign

9961.49 --> 9964.559
[Music]

9965.1 --> 9967.399000000001
foreign

10014.979 --> 10022.76
because I don't have the freaking money

10019.1 --> 10025.84
you want me to risk my own food money on

10022.76 --> 10025.84
an investment like that

10027.979 --> 10031.24
for [ __ ] sake

10031.46 --> 10036.279999999999
I don't know how long it takes to return

10039.08 --> 10044.26
so there's a risk

10041.54 --> 10044.26
no

10044.72 --> 10049.399
there it just might take a while that

10047.24 --> 10051.979
that is the only thing

10049.399 --> 10055.119999999999
and I don't know how long I don't think

10051.979 --> 10055.119999999999
it's going to be that long

10059.24 --> 10064.46
I don't know maybe it's like even like

10061.88 --> 10068.74
very quick I don't know

10064.46 --> 10068.74
like it doesn't say that anywhere

10092.96 --> 10098.019999999999
so what do you want from me Evie

10098.12 --> 10103.04
what do you want from me

10100.88 --> 10105.74
want you you want to give me some kind

10103.04 --> 10110.02
of mortgage backing guarantee

10105.74 --> 10110.02
like what the [ __ ] do you want from me

10112.399 --> 10119.72
just risk no there is no risk

10115.46 --> 10122.179999999998
it's only time only time time is the

10119.72 --> 10125.779999999999
only uncertain factor I have about it

10122.18 --> 10128.42
because it didn't say you will then have

10125.78 --> 10130.58
it within a week There's No presentation

10128.42 --> 10133.6
anywhere that says that they don't say

10130.58 --> 10133.6
how long it takes

10134.479 --> 10139.34
that is all

10137.24 --> 10140.359
I don't know how long it takes it could

10139.34 --> 10143.960000000001
be

10140.359 --> 10146.12
a day it could be a week it could be a

10143.96 --> 10148.419999999998
month it could be half a year I don't

10146.12 --> 10148.42
know

10151.16 --> 10155.8
but you absolutely get it back

10163.04 --> 10168.02
no you can't do you have to have minimum

10166.34 --> 10172.04
of a hundred

10168.02 --> 10174.26
usdt steamy traveler that's the minimum

10172.04 --> 10177.02
and what the [ __ ] is the point even I

10174.26 --> 10179.479
mean if I can't use it then it's all

10177.02 --> 10182.26
completely [ __ ] useless

10179.479 --> 10182.26
good morning

10190.18 --> 10197.18
I'm not hearing any complaints any worry

10193.46 --> 10197.179999999998
like warnings

10197.78 --> 10203.060000000001
through the network about like oh this

10200.479 --> 10206.0
is not safe no

10203.06 --> 10208.22
people are just using it

10206.0 --> 10210.399
so it's probably not even taking that

10208.22 --> 10210.399
long

10216.38 --> 10224.019999999999
they say fast and secure transactions so

10220.7 --> 10224.02
no hidden fees

10225.62 --> 10230.479000000001
I wish they just gave like an average

10228.02 --> 10233.18
time

10230.479 --> 10235.519999999999
thing on it that would be great if they

10233.18 --> 10238.12
just said like this is the average time

10235.52 --> 10238.12
that it takes

10242.0 --> 10246.52
[ __ ] sake I mean come on man this is

10260.899 --> 10266.18
so would you not be able to say when you

10264.2 --> 10268.7
could pay someone back then

10266.18 --> 10273.1
like Evie

10268.7 --> 10273.1
you want to help me out or not

10274.34 --> 10280.399
I mean if you're that tight

10277.939 --> 10282.7
if you're like that scared of

10280.399 --> 10288.019999999999
potentially through risk or whatever

10282.7 --> 10290.2
losing your 100 usdt then what are we

10288.02 --> 10293.18
even talking about

10290.2 --> 10296.359
I mean I guess then you may might want

10293.18 --> 10299.0
to save it for food money like me

10296.359 --> 10299.960000000001
if it's that much of a risk to you I

10299.0 --> 10302.62
mean

10299.96 --> 10302.619999999999
come on

10322.819 --> 10325.819
foreign

10332.38 --> 10339.019999999999
piece of [ __ ] thing there I hate it

10336.56 --> 10342.38
[ __ ] hate it

10339.02 --> 10344.779
it's worse than the trolls that [ __ ]

10342.38 --> 10349.899
heart in the stupid corner of the chat

10344.779 --> 10349.899000000001
is worse than the trolls

10365.6 --> 10370.45

what the [ __ ] is gonna do it how how can

10478.34 --> 10482.8
it be so damn scary to do that

10483.56 --> 10489.68
Jesus because I can actually problems

10487.399 --> 10493.819
that I can do that I can't promise you

10489.68 --> 10496.7
to give you a hundred percent profit if

10493.819 --> 10499.039999999999
it's really that necessary I can do that

10496.7 --> 10501.08
you know how you give me the Thousand I

10499.04 --> 10503.240000000002
make two thousand I give you a thousand

10501.08 --> 10505.76
back then I take the thousand

10503.24 --> 10507.5
make another thousand and then give you

10505.76 --> 10509.72
the other thousand back and I still have

10507.5 --> 10513.14
a thousand left okay is that what you

10509.72 --> 10515.06
need is that what it takes

10513.14 --> 10518.26
like what the [ __ ]

10515.06 --> 10518.26
how hard can it be

10519.319 --> 10525.56
thanks for the soup for the PayPal see

10521.899 --> 10528.64
me traveler not a hundred euros but yeah

10525.56 --> 10528.64

10530.06 --> 10536.539999999999
but you can use errors to buy yeah yeah

10532.819 --> 10540.439
that's just [ __ ] great isn't it

10536.54 --> 10543.080000000002
so I can pay it out of my own pocket

10540.439 --> 10545.54
and then oh maybe well maybe it'll take

10543.08 --> 10548.779
a month yeah and then suddenly I have a

10545.54 --> 10550.76
hundred euros less to eat in that month

10548.779 --> 10552.939
that I have to wait

10550.76 --> 10556.72
so that's just great

10552.939 --> 10556.720000000001
that's just fantastic

10568.76 --> 10573.859
I mean hell I could just go to a bank

10571.399 --> 10575.06
and say Hey I want to borrow a thousand

10573.859 --> 10578.92
Euros

10575.06 --> 10578.92
I could do that too yeah sure

10579.8 --> 10583.938999999998
oh I don't know if that can actually do

10581.899 --> 10587.778999999999
that but I mean

10583.939 --> 10590.42

10623.18 --> 10628.7
PayPal but oh not the crypto oh no

fine then don't

10647.84 --> 10653.12
if I heard a good portion of money what

10650.359 --> 10656.960000000001

10669.02 --> 10677.6
I do there is in I could literally like

10674.66 --> 10680.119999999999
in a week I could spend like 20 000

10677.6 --> 10683.18
Euros on things that I've been needing

10680.12 --> 10686.42
and wanting to do over this last decade

10683.18 --> 10690.380000000001
okay there's so [ __ ] much I can

10686.42 --> 10693.439
invest in just maintenance alone

10690.38 --> 10695.72
it's it's too much to count I could

10693.439 --> 10700.04
spend an entire two hour show just

10695.72 --> 10700.88
naming things let's not do that

10700.04 --> 10704.54
thank you

10700.88 --> 10706.399

that's right

10706.399 --> 10711.68
so yeah I can't wait to get this GTI

10709.16 --> 10713.72
thing rolling to to get that tether and

10711.68 --> 10716.859
to get it done

10713.72 --> 10721.099999999999
what I mean oh no

10716.859 --> 10723.26
it's so scary because it's crypto and

10721.1 --> 10724.939
well if you give somebody crypto you

10723.26 --> 10727.16
might get cursed you might get the

10724.939 --> 10729.800000000001
crypto curse

10727.16 --> 10732.22

about crypto on the internet

10755.54 --> 10761.060000000001
yeah you'll spend 15 minutes
