[Music]

32.7 --> 34.760000000000005
you

41.7 --> 49.02
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

45.66 --> 51.12
early-bird number 374 I'm your host

49.02 --> 52.86
Arwen before we start the show please

51.12 --> 54.54
don't forget to share it on any platform

52.86 --> 56.399
you deem fit and if you haven't already

54.54 --> 58.019
subscribe to my channel and hit the bell

56.399 --> 60.54
notification so you know when I'm going

58.019 --> 61.46
live which is normally 2 p.m. Amsterdam

60.54 --> 64.589
time every day

61.46 --> 66.78
please also support me and my channel

64.589 --> 69.479
through the paypal patreon my GoFundMe

66.78 --> 80.85
and the super Jets that will be much

69.479 --> 83.46
appreciated today the weather is I don't

80.85 --> 90.69
know hasn't rained or anything it was

83.46 --> 95.369
actually clearer this morning yeah so I

90.69 --> 97.229
had a good walk same route pumped in

95.369 --> 100.649
quite a lot of people and people with

97.229 --> 108.27
dogs of course him lots and lots of bird

100.649 --> 109.46000000000001
activities I know it was good yeah today

108.27 --> 113.27
I have with me

109.46 --> 119.75899999999999
still some Tamera coffee although ya

113.27 --> 122.46
know yesterday it it wasn't as pleasant

119.759 --> 125.57
as I hoped it would be and today I

122.46 --> 129.179
already had a few sips and just like I

125.57 --> 132.09
don't know I need to need to quit these

129.179 --> 136.53
things and also this tea is not green

132.09 --> 141.299
tea it's actually mint tea because I'm

136.53 --> 143.459
stepping away from all that caffeine

141.299 --> 145.59
type stuff not saying I'm doing that

143.459 --> 150.239
permanently although that would I guess

145.59 --> 152.88
be kind of healthier but in the in the

150.239 --> 156.15
state I've found myself in once again in

152.88 --> 162.299
the last week I think I need to do that

156.15 --> 164.25
just stabilize my system otherwise it's

162.299 --> 166.62900000000002
gonna keep on a roller coaster and it's

164.25 --> 171.59
not healthy

166.629 --> 173.45
although I don't know anyway

171.59 --> 175.67000000000002
cutting down on the caffeine and the

173.45 --> 180.01899999999998
alcohol to its Feria as I said yesterday

175.67 --> 181.909
it's hard to wean off but taking the

180.019 --> 186.68
foot off the gas slowing it down getting

181.909 --> 192.85899999999998
less and I already feel bit better than

186.68 --> 202.4
yesterday but yeah ups and downs ups and

192.859 --> 205.459
downs problem is this state it distracts

202.4 --> 208.909
so much it's such a distraction for me I

205.459 --> 211.129
don't know what you people are just like

208.909 --> 214.60899999999998
oh just waiting for our way to get

211.129 --> 222.16899999999998
through that I am because it just

214.609 --> 224.239
distracts me so badly often that I don't

222.169 --> 224.84
have a lot of energy for others left for

224.239 --> 231.019
other stuff

224.84 --> 233.659
although yeah Dejan is now digging into

231.019 --> 238.06
the whole concept of transmutation and

233.659 --> 244.39999999999998
that is really interesting it's like

238.06 --> 248.69
yeah a new thing to work it's it feels

244.4 --> 250.659
to me like transmutation in-between

248.69 --> 256.13
chemistry is almost like finding out

250.659 --> 260.69
epigenetics among genetics and maybe

256.13 --> 264.13
that is even a good comparison there's

260.69 --> 264.13
just a lot to find out there

270.08 --> 273.31899999999996
all right

310.46 --> 312.94
yeah

328.46 --> 335.94
hi-yah dank yeah I'm kinda trying to

333.86 --> 338.49
I've done it before

335.94 --> 340.5
like acutely when I'm in this state like

338.49 --> 342.71000000000004
getting the science like okay this is

340.5 --> 349.59
just making things worse oh then I just

342.71 --> 351.9
smoke only tobacco instead but yeah it's

349.59 --> 353.729
very tough to completely step away

351.9 --> 355.83
especially when I start to feel a little

353.729 --> 358.82
bit better which is like every day that

355.83 --> 364.7
does happen it's really like

358.82 --> 367.169
quicks ups and downs in a day also the

364.7 --> 370.83
disconcerting about the experience is

367.169 --> 374.60999999999996
that it moves so quickly from one one

370.83 --> 382.15999999999997
state to another and that's kind of

374.61 --> 382.16
shocking to go through that and yeah

388.71 --> 399.55899999999997
so I'm definitely slowing it down

391.68 --> 399.559
[Music]

405.999 --> 409.889
yep bet you do Chris

450.75 --> 462.57
oh wow amazing

458.24 --> 464.85
so Nathan actually said a wrong word one

462.57 --> 471.09
time that's incredible man he's totally

464.85 --> 473.16
discredited now all right yeah we do

471.09 --> 476.64
need a topic well I I think I'm gonna

473.16 --> 479.46000000000004
try calling this guy that I tried to

476.64 --> 481.89
call Monday and Wednesday and he's here

479.46 --> 489.93
now though he says he's at work or we'll

481.89 --> 495.34999999999997
see I'm gonna call him up you got me

489.93 --> 499.8
hello can you hear me yes yes I can boss

495.35 --> 502.86
hey yeah you just turn my mic down a

499.8 --> 504.84000000000003
little bit on my end all right

502.86 --> 512.82
yeah it's good to finally have you on

504.84 --> 515.2189999999999
trying missus hey so yeah yeah thanks

512.82 --> 516.9300000000001
for for contacting me yeah was there

515.219 --> 520.86
anything specific you wanted to talk

516.93 --> 523.289
about or like that one thing I've been

520.86 --> 525.69
thinking about for the last couple of

523.289 --> 529.1999999999999
months is let's just talk about the

525.69 --> 532.08
Munir for a sec when you see it let's

529.2 --> 535.7900000000001
just say it's 5:00 p.m. and you can

532.08 --> 538.9200000000001
observe it go through the sky 12 14

535.79 --> 542.49
however many hours no matter where it's

538.92 --> 545.7299999999999
at it never seems bigger it's like it's

542.49 --> 547.77
always the same distance you can't

545.73 --> 549.75
understand what I'm saying like if you

547.77 --> 551.31
see a rice Peron distance you mean a

549.75 --> 554.31
parent yes correct

551.31 --> 557.0699999999999
right oh how was that that if it's

554.31 --> 559.92
coming towards you and over your head it

557.07 --> 563.72
doesn't look like way more massive but

559.92 --> 568.2299999999999
it doesn't I know it don't ya but why

563.72 --> 570.33
why would you ask me then why doesn't it

568.23 --> 571.77
look like that because it doesn't what's

570.33 --> 574.08
the point but here's the thing where's

571.77 --> 576.26
the thing if I had a basketball in my

574.08 --> 579.2090000000001
hand and I was 50 yards away from you

576.26 --> 581.79
okay and then I came closer to you

579.209 --> 583.01
wouldn't that basketball seem to appear

581.79 --> 585.649
bigger

583.01 --> 586.73
yeah who cares what does that have to do

585.649 --> 590.449
with anything of it

586.73 --> 592.37
there is no ball up there or something

590.449 --> 593.12
up there there's no ball up there not

592.37 --> 596.66
close

593.12 --> 600.17
not far away it's not a ball those are

596.66 --> 602.5699999999999
not objects it's light that's why they

600.17 --> 605.449
always look the same distance that where

602.57 --> 609.32
they always face you the same way that's

605.449 --> 611.899
why there is no empirical proven effects

609.32 --> 614.269
from the earth to have any influence

611.899 --> 617.0
whatsoever on the sightings of the

614.269 --> 620.63
celestial bodies nothing we do here on

617.0 --> 623.0
earth the influence is it whatsoever the

620.63 --> 625.1
only thing that we can do is obscure it

623.0 --> 627.589
with clouds or whatever that's the only

625.1 --> 629.9300000000001
influence we have there is nothing that

627.589 --> 636.8800000000001
can influence it because it's not

629.93 --> 640.4899999999999
physical physical yep

636.88 --> 643.9399999999999
moons not a physical object definitely

640.49 --> 645.92
not and you know it's tough and can

643.94 --> 649.639
drive people insane and that's why they

645.92 --> 651.55
call it a lunatic because it is weird

649.639 --> 656.199
enough to drive people insane

651.55 --> 659.93
yes it is historically so biblically

656.199 --> 662.7199999999999
biblically historically doesn't matter

659.93 --> 665.2399999999999
how you approach it people go crazy over

662.72 --> 669.7090000000001
the moon and the confusion that it rings

665.24 --> 672.47
when you try to figure it out why yeah I

669.709 --> 674.5999999999999
mean it don't really confuse me I just I

672.47 --> 677.5690000000001
just find some of it fascinating is all

674.6 --> 682.49
I guess all the stars and the heavenly

677.569 --> 684.019
bodies up there all right of course but

682.49 --> 686.269
I mean I know it's nothing we've landed

684.019 --> 689.92
out or Evercore I mean haven't bleep

686.269 --> 692.87
that since I was a kid all right

689.92 --> 695.149
okay well that's that's a good start but

692.87 --> 701.62
it's definitely not some kind of thing

695.149 --> 701.62
floating over a disk it's just not true

703.81 --> 709.7299999999999
we mean it's not something that's

707.14 --> 712.8199999999999
flowing over a disc I mean now it's it's

709.73 --> 714.74
up there doing something but it is up

712.82 --> 717.8900000000001
there you're already designating it as

714.74 --> 720.98
an object having a literal location

717.89 --> 726.92
you're having serious difficulties with

720.98 --> 728.9300000000001
physicality assumption bias here you see

726.92 --> 730.76
it so you assume it's an object has to

728.93 --> 733.01
be right well that's the natural

730.76 --> 734.63
response well it's not not a solid

733.01 --> 737.54
object I don't have to think it is saft

734.63 --> 739.76
I mean I I see a light up there mean and

737.54 --> 741.4399999999999
I see a move so yeah I mean anyone can

739.76 --> 748.13
observe that happen they've been doing

741.44 --> 752.36
that for thousands of years so I mean it

748.13 --> 755.18
moves are you the the impaired the

752.36 --> 758.99
apparent light moves yes well son an

755.18 --> 761.54
apparent light it is late okay well the

758.99 --> 764.149
light moves right but the apparent

761.54 --> 766.31
object the light yeah it moves that's

764.149 --> 769.899
just like the Sun all right this is the

766.31 --> 769.899
same thing it's just a lot stronger

772.97 --> 779.15
I mean are you holding two conversations

776.12 --> 781.13
here I shouldn't be maybe watching ah no

779.15 --> 783.7099999999999
no I'm having a conversation directly

781.13 --> 786.71
with you and like keeping track to keep

783.71 --> 788.21
my chat in check I got checked no I got

786.71 --> 789.9200000000001
j-just when I'm watching the video

788.21 --> 795.85
sometimes that I'm not we're not like

789.92 --> 799.5699999999999
synced up now it's best to keep track

795.85 --> 802.6700000000001
through through your skype I gotcha

799.57 --> 804.5300000000001
with the voice yeah yeah I'm not I

802.67 --> 806.36
haven't turned my video on in it of

804.53 --> 808.91
course so you have if you want to see me

806.36 --> 812.0
then you'll have to look on youtube I

808.91 --> 823.27
can look in the OBS but I forget of

812.0 --> 823.27
course that you can't anyway the moon

823.93 --> 828.8599999999999
yeah I mean I wish week I wish there was

827.27 --> 831.56
more we could find out about it because

828.86 --> 834.17
I mean it mean all that stuff up there

831.56 --> 836.3299999999999
is fascinating it not enough people go

834.17 --> 839.0899999999999
out there at night and look at the skies

836.33 --> 840.83
anymore you know to watch the stuff that

839.09 --> 844.6700000000001
happens and flies by up there it's

840.83 --> 847.37
amazing right it is doesn't take long to

844.67 --> 849.14
see much to see it either there's a lot

847.37 --> 852.29
of fascinating things going on into

849.14 --> 858.5
heavens I think yeah and they're not

852.29 --> 862.3299999999999
satellites right there well there seems

858.5 --> 865.58
to be like almost just wandering bodies

862.33 --> 869.3000000000001
that are not planets that are not

865.58 --> 872.84
something with the app propelled like an

869.3 --> 874.9699999999999
aircraft there are things sometimes up

872.84 --> 876.49
there that just that I can place like

874.97 --> 879.2900000000001
what is that

876.49 --> 880.85
well you I would naturally assume it

879.29 --> 882.8
should be an airplane but it just

880.85 --> 884.8100000000001
doesn't look or feel like an airplane

882.8 --> 888.41
doesn't move not saying that's like the

884.81 --> 894.16
whole weirdo super changing angle type

888.41 --> 898.0699999999999
UFO spots but just odd moving things I

894.16 --> 901.91
got a video of something when I'm moving

898.07 --> 903.95
I have to try to get downloaded but uh

901.91 --> 905.649
yeah they're not planes I mean you can

903.95 --> 907.119
tell there's between planes and what

905.649 --> 908.68
for some of these other lates are that

907.119 --> 911.35
are going through they're just from the

908.68 --> 914.1289999999999
speeds that they go sometimes they start

911.35 --> 917.019
you know it'll stop or they'll also like

914.129 --> 918.97
get this burst where they get except or

917.019 --> 920.529
bright and then it feeds back to their

918.97 --> 922.6
normal brightness I mean and they're

920.529 --> 925.509
flying through the freakin sky and I

922.6 --> 927.49
mean flying you know I mean you sit up

925.509 --> 930.22
out at night and you can observe this

927.49 --> 933.759
any night on a clear night and yeah all

930.22 --> 935.9200000000001
day long enough yes I agree when it's

933.759 --> 941.0500000000001
very clear there's just a lot to be seen

935.92 --> 943.809
and yeah did you you could potentially

941.05 --> 946.8689999999999
like trace everything back that happens

943.809 --> 949.24
and whatever have the whole library to

946.869 --> 951.0400000000001
reference all the star charts where

949.24 --> 953.769
everything should be and all the planes

951.04 --> 955.629
where everything should be and and I'll

953.769 --> 959.199
bet there will be things out there that

955.629 --> 961.9200000000001
you just really that are not supposed to

959.199 --> 966.3689999999999
be there according to all the data and

961.92 --> 967.779
yeah what are you doing but yeah I don't

966.369 --> 970.72
know what because I don't have all that

967.779 --> 974.35
it just I'm just using my intuition and

970.72 --> 977.3190000000001
sometimes I yeah I always do no to know

974.35 --> 980.019
what planes are like when they come like

977.319 --> 982.329
in the dark from the distance usually

980.019 --> 985.389
they have like a flesh that goes on and

982.329 --> 987.8389999999999
off in a very specific rate and when it

985.389 --> 991.809
doesn't do that it's very off it's like

987.839 --> 993.7900000000001
what is that that's not that's not the

991.809 --> 995.55
whole plane is supposed to behave

993.79 --> 997.809
according to the rules

995.55 --> 1001.319
yeah and it's rare that you never see a

997.809 --> 1003.3
plane without seeing the light blinking

1001.319 --> 1005.49
on it and if you ever do you will

1003.3 --> 1007.949
normally here at least the sound of it

1005.49 --> 1011.069
eventually yes eventually correct yeah

1007.949 --> 1013.2589999999999
but some of the stuff that I see nightly

1011.069 --> 1017.519
when I'm out looking no there's no

1013.259 --> 1018.809
explanation for it alright other than

1017.519 --> 1023.1
stuff I've read like in the Book of

1018.809 --> 1025.4089999999999
Enoch you know saw but thatthat started

1023.1 --> 1028.3700000000001
to get deep in the rabbit hole my first

1025.409 --> 1028.3700000000001
time on you know what I mean

1029.22 --> 1036.6100000000001
yeah all right I don't know what's going

1032.68 --> 1039.1000000000001
on up there sometimes I wonder if it you

1036.61 --> 1041.11
know at this point the way that we the

1039.1 --> 1048.04
way things work in the world it seems

1041.11 --> 1050.08
and how much groups or people that have

1048.04 --> 1052.45
some kind of control or oversight just

1050.08 --> 1054.85
seems to be seem to be screwing around

1052.45 --> 1058.54
with those not in the know I sometimes

1054.85 --> 1062.6699999999998
wonder if those weird sightings are just

1058.54 --> 1065.59
some kind of covert hobby program of

1062.67 --> 1068.5
literally holographic screwing around up

1065.59 --> 1070.72
there because they can and that they do

1068.5 --> 1074.14
it specifically to keep on inspiring

1070.72 --> 1076.42
people in believing in UFOs and going

1074.14 --> 1078.91
along with that type of thinking buy

1076.42 --> 1081.3400000000001
into that type of narrative I really

1078.91 --> 1083.7
wonder sometimes if it is only there to

1081.34 --> 1086.05
screw with our minds there's no

1083.7 --> 1088.5900000000001
significance relevance for whatsoever

1086.05 --> 1091.3
other than that because it could be I

1088.59 --> 1094.4399999999998
think the stories are not know since the

1091.3 --> 1099.8799999999999
90s they had the holographic techniques

1094.44 --> 1102.3700000000001
so they could definitely do that I don't

1099.88 --> 1105.0700000000002
remember seeing that many super weird

1102.37 --> 1109.0
UFO like phenomena when I was a little

1105.07 --> 1111.4299999999998
kid it really only started to come at me

1109.0 --> 1113.68
like after the 2000

1111.43 --> 1118.75
oh I'm then it became a thing too yet

1113.68 --> 1122.2
like the the UFO cups and special orders

1118.75 --> 1125.92
already in the late 90s but I remember

1122.2 --> 1128.65
seeing it more in the 70s as far as more

1125.92 --> 1130.24
of like meteors which I don't believe in

1128.65 --> 1131.8600000000001
shooting stars which I don't believe in

1130.24 --> 1134.05
falling stars which I don't believe in

1131.86 --> 1137.29
but back in the seventies it means you

1134.05 --> 1140.68
can see them way more than I do now

1137.29 --> 1144.37
I've seen so many falling stars and even

1140.68 --> 1148.93
like with physical manifestations of

1144.37 --> 1150.85
them and I don't know why you mean you

1148.93 --> 1155.1100000000001
actually found the falling star no yeah

1150.85 --> 1157.75
no I would literally see them burn up in

1155.11 --> 1161.1399999999999
front of them like fireworks like

1157.75 --> 1162.88
glittering iron and I would hear

1161.14 --> 1166.7800000000002
flickering and I would see the

1162.88 --> 1170.38
flashlights coming off having distant

1166.78 --> 1172.6
type of reflection on the surroundings

1170.38 --> 1174.97
like really close by

1172.6 --> 1177.73
it's crazy I've seen it several times

1174.97 --> 1179.44
and it's just like that is not a visual

1177.73 --> 1182.17
phenomena that is a physical thing

1179.44 --> 1186.73
burning up how the hell did that get

1182.17 --> 1190.69
here why I think it's more on the

1186.73 --> 1192.49
spiritual realm okay so do you think

1190.69 --> 1194.56
it's just in the hallucination that I'd

1192.49 --> 1196.99
see a piece of fireworks that nobody

1194.56 --> 1199.4199999999998
else apparently knows but oh no you seen

1196.99 --> 1201.22
a firework but you see a light feed and

1199.42 --> 1203.38
you know or burst and then fade away you

1201.22 --> 1206.59
have no clue what it is no no no I'm not

1203.38 --> 1208.8100000000002
I'm talking about things that I see so

1206.59 --> 1211.23
close by it could be like within hundred

1208.81 --> 1213.82
meters maybe a little more not about

1211.23 --> 1216.6100000000001
super far in the distance no really

1213.82 --> 1219.8799999999999
really close by that you could literally

1216.61 --> 1221.1999999999998
see the sparks flying off it again

1219.88 --> 1223.0900000000001
you're still seeing Sparks you're seeing

1221.2 --> 1225.49
lights you're not you have no sparks no

1223.09 --> 1227.26
no if you see in fireworks that you know

1225.49 --> 1228.85
there's this concentrated part where

1227.26 --> 1232.65
it's reacting and then there's sparks

1228.85 --> 1236.4699999999998
flying off that it's like literal

1232.65 --> 1237.7
firework elements don't have 100 meters

1236.47 --> 1239.1100000000001
you should have walked up to and got the

1237.7 --> 1241.48
remnants of that rock now be a

1239.11 --> 1243.31
millionaire there's no no but it burned

1241.48 --> 1246.94
up completely before it even hit the

1243.31 --> 1248.77
ground yeah I got an issue with that I'm

1246.94 --> 1250.39
not saying you didn't see something but

1248.77 --> 1252.22
just exactly what you're seeing I have

1250.39 --> 1254.1100000000001
no idea it's no different than the

1252.22 --> 1256.33
lights flying by you're seeing up high

1254.11 --> 1258.61
at night flying it I could have size up

1256.33 --> 1261.52
where it was coming down particularly

1258.61 --> 1263.2299999999998
and it was at a party and in the middle

1261.52 --> 1266.53
of the house I didn't I didn't even know

1263.23 --> 1268.39
where there was so I could have like oh

1266.53 --> 1271.36
I saw a falling star I'm now going

1268.39 --> 1272.74
outside trying to find it and there was

1271.36 --> 1276.1599999999999
a hundred percent guarantee that I

1272.74 --> 1278.5
wouldn't find it but I know that I saw

1276.16 --> 1281.53
that and that's just one time like well

1278.5 --> 1284.86
I've seen many things that I just don't

1281.53 --> 1287.56
believe what I was taught as a kid as to

1284.86 --> 1290.02
what it probably really is all right I

1287.56 --> 1291.6399999999999
mean I believe in us going in when I kid

1290.02 --> 1293.12
you I believe you're falling stars and

1291.64 --> 1297.289
meteorites and that [ __ ]

1293.12 --> 1301.7199999999998
no I don't believe that no more cuz I

1297.289 --> 1305.269
don't think stars are physical alright

1301.72 --> 1308.32
well I don't know what falling stars

1305.269 --> 1310.999
raise but I they're not rocks

1308.32 --> 1312.62
entering from the vacuum of space into

1310.999 --> 1314.21
our atmosphere and burning up that's

1312.62 --> 1317.09
just not what it is I don't know what

1314.21 --> 1318.95
they are right but you're saying use but

1317.09 --> 1320.059
so when you're saying you saw something

1318.95 --> 1321.5900000000001
you're not seeing it was actually a

1320.059 --> 1326.809
Starks the meteorite would just be a

1321.59 --> 1329.99
rock coming from space well I didn't see

1326.809 --> 1332.57
it come from way up there going way down

1329.99 --> 1339.08
oh it's rather like I'm looking around

1332.57 --> 1341.749
and suddenly you see like yeah so I

1339.08 --> 1347.509
didn't see it way off there birding no

1341.749 --> 1351.47
it there was no long-term ignition it

1347.509 --> 1354.44
seemed to ignite probably in total of

1351.47 --> 1357.8890000000001
one second that's right

1354.44 --> 1359.929
right which is pretty long by the way

1357.889 --> 1361.779
because falling stars did you see way up

1359.929 --> 1366.47
there and I've seen those as well

1361.779 --> 1368.179
they're so short is like and you got to

1366.47 --> 1369.71
ask yourself why I mean why don't you

1368.179 --> 1371.8400000000001
see it sooner why wouldn't you see these

1369.71 --> 1374.24
things like you see that it really see

1371.84 --> 1376.97
up here to be close only last for a

1374.24 --> 1378.529
second or so why why aren't you seeing

1376.97 --> 1381.679
it coming from further away and going

1378.529 --> 1384.35
further well because it's not that I

1381.679 --> 1386.509
just want to know what it is I really

1384.35 --> 1388.129
don't care for the ball [ __ ] ball story

1386.509 --> 1390.499
by what it's supposed to be anymore I

1388.129 --> 1394.549
really don't care I just want to know

1390.499 --> 1397.159
what it is do what is that it like how

1394.549 --> 1399.74
does that fit into a contained realm

1397.159 --> 1406.6390000000001
I can't make any freaking sense of it

1399.74 --> 1407.1490000000001
like why why why would it always like

1406.639 --> 1409.9699999999998
that

1407.149 --> 1411.529
why wouldn't look if it's like if some

1409.97 --> 1414.3500000000001
people would automatically start to

1411.529 --> 1417.039
suggest freaking oh my dad is stuck

1414.35 --> 1417.039
again hold on

1417.75 --> 1425.94
I fresh alright but yeah some people

1424.08 --> 1429.12
think oh it's a piece of the firmament

1425.94 --> 1431.3300000000002
breaking off or falling down yeah right

1429.12 --> 1434.4899999999998
that's gonna make things burn up sure

1431.33 --> 1436.98
some breaking off and naturally falling

1434.49 --> 1438.81
that's gonna cause it to burn no no

1436.98 --> 1441.74
never happens that doesn't make any

1438.81 --> 1445.05
sense so there's something igniting

1441.74 --> 1447.57
metal somehow does this man I'm

1445.05 --> 1449.73
absolutely sure it's metal of some kind

1447.57 --> 1452.55
because other materials don't burn that

1449.73 --> 1455.49
way it's only when metals are involved

1452.55 --> 1457.86
it's like fireworks and probably iron it

1455.49 --> 1460.29
looks like iron the sparks are typically

1457.86 --> 1463.77
iron sparks sorry I just know the color

1460.29 --> 1466.29
of yeah fireworks you know I used to be

1463.77 --> 1468.15
into violence but it seems to be iron

1466.29 --> 1471.21
spark and I don't know how it comes into

1468.15 --> 1473.46
being and it it it can't just be

1471.21 --> 1475.89
something breaking off then you wouldn't

1473.46 --> 1478.74
have these weird reoccurring patterns of

1475.89 --> 1481.7900000000002
for example but they say that in August

1478.74 --> 1484.29
there's typically a lot of falling stars

1481.79 --> 1486.8999999999999
there would be would there be a phase

1484.29 --> 1489.54
two is orbit hmm you don't always

1486.9 --> 1493.47
observe it when you say it well I have

1489.54 --> 1495.69
well I'm at times yes like in August

1493.47 --> 1498.54
I've seen a lot like every time we get

1495.69 --> 1500.64
went to Spain and there clear nights in

1498.54 --> 1504.57
August and yeah it's falling stars oh

1500.64 --> 1509.88
yeah lots of them but I see lots of them

1504.57 --> 1511.62
in December January February you know if

1509.88 --> 1514.2
you get out and look that's a thing you

1511.62 --> 1515.82
mean when they tell us times are gonna

1514.2 --> 1518.43
be there I think we spend more time

1515.82 --> 1520.29
actually looking up you know if you're

1518.43 --> 1523.0800000000002
just out there every night observing

1520.29 --> 1525.93
when you can I mean it's shocking what

1523.08 --> 1529.58
you see move up there I mean sense scary

1525.93 --> 1529.5800000000002
shocking sometimes you know what I mean

1529.61 --> 1539.58
some freaky stuff going on yeah sorry

1537.66 --> 1542.48
repeat that last part I was distracted

1539.58 --> 1545.07
for a moment well I just saying you know

1542.48 --> 1547.65
when you're told that a certain date

1545.07 --> 1550.4399999999998
they're gonna be there we spend you know

1547.65 --> 1552.3300000000002
more concentrate looking at that time up

1550.44 --> 1554.8500000000001
in the sky but if you're out every day

1552.33 --> 1558.21
when you have the chance you're gonna

1554.85 --> 1560.61
see stuff that just blows your mind

1558.21 --> 1563.01
I mean I've watched when they said yeah

1560.61 --> 1565.35
August 21st this is gonna be that meteor

1563.01 --> 1566.49
shower night then you see nothing you

1565.35 --> 1567.9299999999998
know a month later

1566.49 --> 1571.64
nothing's supposed to happen and you're

1567.93 --> 1573.69
seen by the hundreds of stuff going on I

1571.64 --> 1577.0800000000002
don't know I've never I've never

1573.69 --> 1579.3300000000002
experienced it like that usually if they

1577.08 --> 1581.97
say okay there's a lot of falling stars

1579.33 --> 1587.6699999999998
in August I would look then yeah I get

1581.97 --> 1589.98
like 20 30 in an hour inside you know

1587.67 --> 1592.65
buddy but you ever go out and spend that

1589.98 --> 1594.5
amount of time looking without knowing

1592.65 --> 1597.72
if they're supposed to be happening yeah

1594.5 --> 1601.29
yeah yeah I was with my first girlfriend

1597.72 --> 1604.5
who was into ufology a lot so I actually

1601.29 --> 1609.27
spent several nights with binoculars

1604.5 --> 1614.67
just staring at the sky yes yeah and

1609.27 --> 1616.83
never saw a single UFO ever ever even

1614.67 --> 1619.77
though I really wanted to never ever

1616.83 --> 1623.1
ever ever ever have I seen it other than

1619.77 --> 1625.53
on a TV screaming of some kind falling

1623.1 --> 1626.9399999999998
stars though plenty of them oh yeah I'm

1625.53 --> 1628.71
just as the lights flying through the

1626.94 --> 1630.3600000000001
skies too I mean I you see them all the

1628.71 --> 1632.46
time I don't yeah but never like the

1630.36 --> 1634.4699999999998
real typical like sudden change

1632.46 --> 1637.29
direction type of you for what the

1634.47 --> 1640.38
would-be Sun considered the real you if

1637.29 --> 1642.21
I was never seen that ever so I've seen

1640.38 --> 1644.25
him slow down and speed up the story

1642.21 --> 1647.16
from us it does I've seen him from a

1644.25 --> 1650.13
standstill takeoff though but only in

1647.16 --> 1652.3200000000002
one direction I've never seen oh I I've

1650.13 --> 1654.21
never seen them like you say do it a 90

1652.32 --> 1655.5
degree 45 degree turns or nothing like

1654.21 --> 1662.88
that ever know

1655.5 --> 1665.4
a GM had a good comment both angels

1662.88 --> 1666.69
burning up in the atmosphere I mean it

1665.4 --> 1669.15
could be that they're burning up or that

1666.69 --> 1670.89
they're you know have these certain

1669.15 --> 1673.5
paths that defy to make sure the other

1670.89 --> 1675.179
stars slash angels are in their proper

1673.5 --> 1675.84
position doing what they're supposed to

1675.179 --> 1680.159
do too

1675.84 --> 1684.09
that's kind of my thoughts on it what

1680.159 --> 1686.8200000000002
angels what yes I think yes I think

1684.09 --> 1688.32
stars are angels and I think there's

1686.82 --> 1690.1789999999999
some bad ones that might be out there

1688.32 --> 1692.789
too that fly you know get off course or

1690.179 --> 1695.7
do things I'm not sure you mean the

1692.789 --> 1699.24
light you think yes there are some kind

1695.7 --> 1700.919
of energy frequency that has an

1699.24 --> 1704.789
influence and that there are like

1700.919 --> 1707.19
individual types of light that's yes I

1704.789 --> 1709.2
do I mean kind of here you're like well

1707.19 --> 1715.5
God says he calls on all of them by name

1709.2 --> 1718.74
so okay oh so I mean that's you don't

1715.5 --> 1721.44
why so yeah looking away astrology does

1718.74 --> 1724.11
kind of like do that and there is

1721.44 --> 1729.3200000000002
something to it well I don't know I

1724.11 --> 1731.7299999999998
would never personify light it's just I

1729.32 --> 1734.01
think everything all of it has an

1731.73 --> 1737.88
influence but I think that there is a

1734.01 --> 1740.07
backdrop influence behind it all that

1737.88 --> 1742.89
has much more weight as to when it puts

1740.07 --> 1745.32
its weight into the ether than the

1742.89 --> 1747.2990000000002
individual type of frequencies of all

1745.32 --> 1749.34
the lights because the yeah when you see

1747.299 --> 1752.01
once I usually see them also they're all

1749.34 --> 1755.82
gonna be there at the same time most of

1752.01 --> 1758.1
the time so if anyone wants to learn a

1755.82 --> 1759.8999999999999
little bit about this just even have a

1758.1 --> 1762.6589999999999
taste of it I mean I recommend reading

1759.9 --> 1765.51
the book Enoch a lot of lot of stuff in

1762.659 --> 1767.6100000000001
there about this it's mind-blowing hmm

1765.51 --> 1771.679
you know if you don't study a research

1767.61 --> 1771.6789999999999
just gonna be ignorant you know

1773.19 --> 1777.78
doesn't mean you have to believe it but

1774.99 --> 1781.89
without at least doing some research

1777.78 --> 1784.1689999999999
well good are you alright well is it

1781.89 --> 1786.39
done there's all kinds of approaches to

1784.169 --> 1790.76
figure out what it is and look even

1786.39 --> 1794.16
through astrology there's just yeah

1790.76 --> 1796.47
there's so much to figure out about it

1794.16 --> 1798.929
and what and like we don't even freaking

1796.47 --> 1801.69
know what causes them okay we don't know

1798.929 --> 1804.299
what causes these lights how they are

1801.69 --> 1804.75
manifesting in the way they are we don't

1804.299 --> 1807.87
know that

1804.75 --> 1811.89
so to assume that it wouldn't do all

1807.87 --> 1815.1589999999999
these things automatically yeah it would

1811.89 --> 1818.13
literally just be ignoring it would be

1815.159 --> 1820.919
ignorant of what yeah what the mystery

1818.13 --> 1823.919
that is they're not sure it's no

1820.919 --> 1825.0900000000001
different than when I like believing

1823.919 --> 1827.3400000000001
that the earth was flat and all that

1825.09 --> 1829.8899999999999
stuff that was easy to prove an income

1827.34 --> 1831.87
to but not you know when it came down to

1829.89 --> 1834.0900000000001
believing that speak was fees fake and

1831.87 --> 1837.2099999999998
the ISS wasn't real I mean it took me

1834.09 --> 1838.6789999999999
once months of studying researching you

1837.21 --> 1841.049
know because you're so brainwashed and

1838.679 --> 1843.659
I'm thinking man I see the ISS flyby I

1841.049 --> 1846.6299999999999
see it on TV once I started doing the

1843.659 --> 1848.6100000000001
research tour the probe letter was true

1846.63 --> 1851.0590000000002
or not I mean that's when you get your

1848.61 --> 1853.7099999999998
answers you know if you don't study

1851.059 --> 1855.36
about the stars of the Moon you'll never

1853.71 --> 1857.58
know you just be dumb don't see people

1855.36 --> 1859.5
thinking that freakin people are up

1857.58 --> 1861.84
there on tin cans walking around having

1859.5 --> 1866.07
a good old time you know all right it's

1861.84 --> 1869.1
not that hard to imagine if you read if

1866.07 --> 1870.809
you don't realize it's impossible then

1869.1 --> 1872.3999999999999
it's not hard to imagine if you just

1870.809 --> 1874.62
don't know yeah it's very easy to

1872.4 --> 1878.64
imagine it can be drawn it's been done

1874.62 --> 1880.83
in TV and yeah so it seems plausible

1878.64 --> 1882.98
because you seen it you're used to it

1880.83 --> 1885.99
that that should be possible so why not

1882.98 --> 1889.59
right that's how it all works

1885.99 --> 1893.34
absolutely brainwashing that's just

1889.59 --> 1899.07
making use to what they want you to

1893.34 --> 1900.4499999999998
assume to be normal no that's true and

1899.07 --> 1902.79
the only way to break away from that is

1900.45 --> 1904.559
that you just go prove yourself you know

1902.79 --> 1906.0
forgo try to prove someone else wrong

1904.559 --> 1907.35
that's what I did

1906.0 --> 1909.96
I was gonna prove a buddy wrong and how

1907.35 --> 1913.3799999999999
stupid he was you know but not at being

1909.96 --> 1915.66
space you know and all that being you

1913.38 --> 1916.8600000000001
know in swimming pools on stuff but

1915.66 --> 1918.8100000000002
digging that but didn't take long

1916.86 --> 1922.29
figured out he was right I was a blind

1918.81 --> 1924.75
one you know and I already knew that the

1922.29 --> 1931.35
earth is flat but couldn't conceive of

1924.75 --> 1933.51
there not being an ISS hmm you know yeah

1931.35 --> 1938.79
that's a tough one they put a lot of

1933.51 --> 1941.85
effort into trying to back it up somehow

1938.79 --> 1944.55
with arguments and the weird sightings

1941.85 --> 1947.4599999999998
of the supposed ISS crossing over and

1944.55 --> 1950.52
all that like I don't even know what

1947.46 --> 1954.66
that is for real you know but there seem

1950.52 --> 1957.06
to be a lot of work put into just

1954.66 --> 1958.8000000000002
somehow reinforcing the belief that it

1957.06 --> 1961.32
really must be there not just by this

1958.8 --> 1964.8
supposed to 24 hour livestream which is

1961.32 --> 1966.9299999999998
in 24 hour of course or yeah these

1964.8 --> 1969.93
sightings like oh you can now in your

1966.93 --> 1973.44
telescope see the ISS transit the moon

1969.93 --> 1977.88
or something I don't know how they do it

1973.44 --> 1983.43
I really know but they they're that

1977.88 --> 1985.3500000000001
effort is there you know kind of like

1983.43 --> 1986.91
technology got hardly can fool you man

1985.35 --> 1989.28
just watch that movie gravity with

1986.91 --> 1991.47
Sandra Bullock the stuff they doing

1989.28 --> 1993.84
there is just unbelievable it and then

1991.47 --> 1996.66
you go watch the making of them in that

1993.84 --> 1998.1899999999998
movie I mean it's not know how simple

1996.66 --> 2002.8400000000001
they can fool you they make things look

1998.19 --> 2006.02
so real yeah yeah they know everything

2002.84 --> 2009.1699999999998
about it and I'll also look we've been

2006.02 --> 2011.36
conditioned to go along with it you know

2009.17 --> 2014.3300000000002
if you're gonna watch a movie called

2011.36 --> 2016.3999999999999
gravity about some space station blowing

2014.33 --> 2019.1599999999999
up and that's pretty it was pretty

2016.4 --> 2021.5
easily what well known even before you

2019.16 --> 2024.5600000000002
watch the movie you're not gonna go

2021.5 --> 2026.33
there it's all fake it's there's no

2024.56 --> 2027.98
place like this this doesn't happen

2026.33 --> 2030.05
there's no vacuum there's no suspense of

2027.98 --> 2031.52
gravity gravity doesn't even think no

2030.05 --> 2035.72
that's not how you're gonna watch that

2031.52 --> 2038.54
movie you're gonna try to at least get

2035.72 --> 2039.56
along as to see what their what the

2038.54 --> 2042.3799999999999
story is

2039.56 --> 2043.61
what's the point what you think when

2042.38 --> 2046.49
you're up there when you're outside of

2043.61 --> 2049.19
the ISSN you become been blown off it

2046.49 --> 2052.25
they're in their late God pushing

2049.19 --> 2055.07
themselves around or moving by using

2052.25 --> 2056.9
that oxygen tank or whatever pushing

2055.07 --> 2059.78
some air out of it I mean what are they

2056.9 --> 2061.4
pushing against what's that air blast

2059.78 --> 2063.71
where's the thrust coming from there I

2061.4 --> 2065.33
mean it's a vacuum right there's nothing

2063.71 --> 2068.96
to push against it shouldn't do anything

2065.33 --> 2070.669
to him but I mean that's just another

2068.96 --> 2072.14
way of brainwashing you and getting you

2070.669 --> 2074.5099999999998
to believe that these things happen in

2072.14 --> 2076.79
Rockets can work in space and all this

2074.51 --> 2080.6000000000004
stuff even though there's nowhere for

2076.79 --> 2082.73
the thrust to push off of but but it

2080.6 --> 2086.15
there's it you can't even get there

2082.73 --> 2089.9
right the idea of the gradient is very

2086.15 --> 2092.63
simple that gradient is there because of

2089.9 --> 2094.37
the size it has to be a certain size

2092.63 --> 2096.7400000000002
because of the consequence of how the

2094.37 --> 2098.96
gradient is divided there has to be a

2096.74 --> 2100.4599999999996
certain size of the container they're

2098.96 --> 2102.35
just making you imagine know that

2100.46 --> 2103.88
gradient can just keep going and getting

2102.35 --> 2106.97
thinner and thinner and thinner into

2103.88 --> 2108.8900000000003
littorals spatial volume eternity and

2106.97 --> 2111.37
that makes no sense concerning the

2108.89 --> 2113.81
nature of gradients of gas pressure

2111.37 --> 2115.43
because the gradient will always be

2113.81 --> 2118.4
secondary to the filling of the

2115.43 --> 2122.99
container and will reflect the volume

2118.4 --> 2125.51
and amount of pressure it will all wait

2122.99 --> 2128.5099999999998
the gradient will always be among the

2125.51 --> 2130.34
total container showing a division in

2128.51 --> 2132.9500000000003
the pressures within and it's never

2130.34 --> 2134.4500000000003
gonna be like super thick that very very

2132.95 --> 2137.12
small layer and then slowly getting

2134.45 --> 2137.87
thinner and just you know that's not how

2137.12 --> 2141.85
it works

2137.87 --> 2144.5299999999997
never I ask people to demonstrate any

2141.85 --> 2146.93
demonstration in any imaginable setting

2144.53 --> 2149.2400000000002
any imaginable setting as long as it's

2146.93 --> 2151.58
physically real doesn't matter how you

2149.24 --> 2156.2599999999998
do it cannot be demonstrated you can

2151.58 --> 2158.45
never demonstrate a gradient of gas

2156.26 --> 2161.3300000000004
pressure even combinations of gas

2158.45 --> 2164.8399999999997
pressure of any sort of imaginable ball

2161.33 --> 2167.39
gas that will result into a very small

2164.84 --> 2170.21
part having a pretty thick pressure and

2167.39 --> 2173.68
then going up with almost nothing in a

2170.21 --> 2173.68
vacuum it's physically impossible

2173.86 --> 2180.29
so the grade in is always secondary to

2177.14 --> 2183.65
the total volume of the container it can

2180.29 --> 2188.59
stick all that gas to that microscopic

2183.65 --> 2191.3
amount of volume in the face of the it

2188.59 --> 2192.17
potentially eternally vast volume of

2191.3 --> 2194.48
outer space

2192.17 --> 2197.36
can't work gradients don't work that way

2194.48 --> 2208.51
ever under any circumstance no matter

2197.36 --> 2211.1600000000003
what you try so you're still there right

2208.51 --> 2213.3500000000004
yeah then put that out there I'm getting

2211.16 --> 2215.2999999999997
some annoying troll feedback here so I

2213.35 --> 2219.5
think it's just gonna be banning time

2215.3 --> 2221.51
for a lot of people no no no no they're

2219.5 --> 2225.29
here they're here to be bent so that's

2221.51 --> 2226.7000000000003
what I'm gonna do bear makes good point

2225.29 --> 2228.95
jar why wouldn't lakes and rivers be

2226.7 --> 2231.3199999999997
pulled with the moon I mean I got a

2228.95 --> 2233.12
buddy like fishing on the river here and

2231.32 --> 2234.4100000000003
every so often you'll just out of

2233.12 --> 2237.1099999999997
nowhere on the river it'll be a big

2234.41 --> 2239.2999999999997
swirl you know like little whirlpool

2237.11 --> 2241.73
type thing and he tries telling me

2239.3 --> 2243.4700000000003
that's the Coriolis effect and I'm like

2241.73 --> 2245.06
whoa and you just went 10 miles stretch

2243.47 --> 2247.31
of water why is only affecting that one

2245.06 --> 2250.97
square foot of water why is it the whole

2247.31 --> 2252.86
river doing it you know cuz it ain't but

2250.97 --> 2255.0499999999997
that's ridiculous it's not that is

2252.86 --> 2257.78
anyway usually when there's a whirlpool

2255.05 --> 2261.32
that means there's a rock it's pushing

2257.78 --> 2263.03
the water aside that will then naturally

2261.32 --> 2266.06
because of the rest of the flow and the

2263.03 --> 2268.52
turbulence will start to create a shift

2266.06 --> 2270.47
that will keep on persisting showing

2268.52 --> 2273.38
itself as a whirlpool in that location

2270.47 --> 2282.7099999999996
that's natural you and I'm a deviation

2273.38 --> 2286.34
of the path Coriolis you know I'm just

2282.71 --> 2288.64
like the moon pulling on oceans that

2286.34 --> 2291.05
create these tides I mean it's just

2288.64 --> 2292.4
imagine if it does it to oceans what it

2291.05 --> 2294.8300000000004
would do to your small lakes it would

2292.4 --> 2296.6
drain them it pulls so hard you know

2294.83 --> 2300.3199999999997
they have flooding everywhere I can't

2296.6 --> 2302.21
imagine a situation as they describe

2300.32 --> 2305.1800000000003
that with the moon pulling that to be

2302.21 --> 2307.3
real it would mean literally every

2305.18 --> 2310.43
single night

2307.3 --> 2313.2400000000002
everybody would feel that freaking thing

2310.43 --> 2321.2
they're physically pulling at them from

2313.24 --> 2323.39
changing angle it's like it's like every

2321.2 --> 2327.77
freaking night no thanks I don't think

2323.39 --> 2329.18
that's real they're fishing on the

2327.77 --> 2330.92
opposite side you wouldn't have to worry

2329.18 --> 2332.06
about the bugs biting your ass because

2330.92 --> 2333.98
you know they'd be getting pulled with

2332.06 --> 2338.72
it but no that doesn't you don't see

2333.98 --> 2341.57
that right oh and we have water in us

2338.72 --> 2344.24
too you know it's kind of salty super

2341.57 --> 2346.31
saturates called blood so yeah it's your

2344.24 --> 2352.37
blood gonna be pull up to the sky when

2346.31 --> 2354.91
you see the moon no here yeah I'll just

2352.37 --> 2357.74
fake believe fairytale nonsense

2354.91 --> 2361.94
it's one of the more ridiculous stories

2357.74 --> 2364.64
I think that the moon's supposed to be

2361.94 --> 2366.71
pools water up like that

2364.64 --> 2370.25
it's one of the sillier stories really

2366.71 --> 2374.51
for the really low tier people that give

2370.25 --> 2376.31
up very easily yeah no I mean it because

2374.51 --> 2378.26
I mean just the simplest facts like

2376.31 --> 2380.5099999999998
Missouri we're seeing what doesn't

2378.26 --> 2382.55
affect any other Lake or any River any

2380.51 --> 2384.4100000000003
of your ponds just think about how many

2382.55 --> 2386.3
people got ponds in their backyard I

2384.41 --> 2387.6099999999997
mean they wake up the next day it

2386.3 --> 2390.86
wouldn't even exist anymore

2387.61 --> 2392.1200000000003
you know cause it took gravitational

2390.86 --> 2395.65
pull would have pulled on right out of

2392.12 --> 2397.94
there I mean it's moving the ocean right

2395.65 --> 2406.82
but you don't need to witness that

2397.94 --> 2411.94
nature right yeah besides the tides are

2406.82 --> 2414.8
not are not a lateral Pole

2411.94 --> 2418.96
it doesn't work that way it seems to be

2414.8 --> 2422.54
more like a like there is a magnetic

2418.96 --> 2425.0
mixer happening like like there's

2422.54 --> 2427.04
literally somebody stirring over that

2425.0 --> 2431.09
location in the water through a magnetic

2427.04 --> 2433.7599999999998
field and that pushes the water around

2431.09 --> 2435.59
and on top of the rest and that is

2433.76 --> 2438.4100000000003
really what causes the tight it's not

2435.59 --> 2440.849
like a body of water and there's like

2438.41 --> 2443.64
this hook pulling it up

2440.849 --> 2445.829
that's not ever how it works there's no

2443.64 --> 2448.6189999999997
just lateral displacement upward off the

2445.829 --> 2452.2490000000003
water no it's getting mixed through the

2448.619 --> 2454.17
magnetics yeah I'm not sure how it works

2452.249 --> 2456.089
but I mean there is maps of this the

2454.17 --> 2458.549
tide maps you should take a look at

2456.089 --> 2463.65
there you can see how how the tides move

2458.549 --> 2466.579
on the entire world and it really just

2463.65 --> 2470.569
seems like there's some mixing going on

2466.579 --> 2473.7290000000003
just yeah I was getting moved somewhere

2470.569 --> 2475.38
whether it's going down around her it's

2473.729 --> 2479.16
like this it just seems like this

2475.38 --> 2481.289
imagine this to be for example England

2479.16 --> 2484.819
or so the ocean surrounding England and

2481.289 --> 2487.4100000000003
it's just somebody it's just doing this

2484.819 --> 2489.779
that's literally what it looks like

2487.41 --> 2492.989
there's somebody's just stirring that's

2489.779 --> 2497.849
have you seen okay it's looks like it's

2492.989 --> 2501.089
amazing how your waves on a full moon I

2497.849 --> 2503.13
don't buy that one either mm-hmm sorry a

2501.089 --> 2503.67
studio scene is higher waves on a full

2503.13 --> 2508.2000000000003
moon

2503.67 --> 2508.739
higher with I we had higher waves on a

2508.2 --> 2514.3489999999997
full moon

2508.739 --> 2515.94
you just say that in chat there's a lot

2514.349 --> 2518.279
of spam right now going on they're just

2515.94 --> 2519.599
they want to insert their ridicule

2518.279 --> 2523.019
because they don't like that we're just

2519.599 --> 2527.7490000000003
comfortably talking about this without

2523.019 --> 2530.3089999999997
feeling shame or yeah yeah just like

2527.749 --> 2532.95
fishing on a full moon and all that

2530.309 --> 2534.719
stuff it's supposed to be but you know

2532.95 --> 2536.489
better three days before during an act

2534.719 --> 2538.44
for a full moon man I've tried that for

2536.489 --> 2540.7490000000003
years and I've I've never had that work

2538.44 --> 2542.369
all from you one freaking time Fisher

2540.749 --> 2547.2
hungry and are they're not you know what

2542.369 --> 2551.609
I'm saying just like me and you well

2547.2 --> 2554.46
there are certain natural cycles so some

2551.609 --> 2557.0389999999998
it can work it all depends you know

2554.46 --> 2559.92
where you're fishing on how natural if

2557.039 --> 2561.599
it's like wild wild nature that may

2559.92 --> 2564.1800000000003
actually work a lot better than if

2561.599 --> 2567.9300000000003
you're just gonna fish in some river by

2564.18 --> 2570.5389999999998
the side of a town or whatever so it all

2567.93 --> 2573.499
depends I think there is something to it

2570.539 --> 2574.7400000000002
because the yeah hey there is just

2573.499 --> 2577.02
organics

2574.74 --> 2579.8689999999997
Michael's bound to the moon cycles I

2577.02 --> 2581.52
mean and that maybe but I've never had

2579.869 --> 2584.82
it happen where it worked in my favor

2581.52 --> 2586.56
and I've tried it for over decades but I

2584.82 --> 2589.17
know other people will say it does work

2586.56 --> 2593.52
so I mean I mean personally it hasn't

2589.17 --> 2594.81
for me but I know other people who said

2593.52 --> 2598.02
it hasn't worked I know a lot of people

2594.81 --> 2599.82
that only fish by moon phases okay wow

2598.02 --> 2601.86
that's that's kind of disappointing then

2599.82 --> 2610.1400000000003
you know if you tried it for decades and

2601.86 --> 2612.57
it never worked I mean I mean like it

2610.14 --> 2614.85
just seems I just gotta send a buddy at

2612.57 --> 2616.6800000000003
Texas no I just seemed like when there

2614.85 --> 2618.14
seemed to be hungry and feeding you

2616.68 --> 2620.97
catch him and after or not they don't

2618.14 --> 2622.41
you know but if it works for other

2620.97 --> 2631.98
people more power to him

2622.41 --> 2638.94
I wish it would work for me the yeah

2631.98 --> 2641.67
I've never been a fisherman myself yeah

2638.94 --> 2643.109
I do it for a hobby basically just do a

2641.67 --> 2644.609
lot of camping and stuff like that so

2643.109 --> 2647.43
that kind of comes with it kayaking

2644.609 --> 2651.69
canoeing stuff like that mm-hmm my dear

2647.43 --> 2654.359
eat it eat the fish then rarely most I'm

2651.69 --> 2656.04
pretty much catching release once a year

2654.359 --> 2658.04
maybe we'll have a little fish fry once

2656.04 --> 2664.41
or twice a year at the most

2658.04 --> 2666.39
alright yeah I never really liked to be

2664.41 --> 2669.45
fair and I'm just my environmentalist

2666.39 --> 2672.39
whatever I never really liked fishing

2669.45 --> 2674.64
also because it's like look to me it

2672.39 --> 2676.77
seems like when you catch a fish it

2674.64 --> 2679.5
really hurts them it can even wound them

2676.77 --> 2681.06
that wound can potentially stay with

2679.5 --> 2684.54
them it's like in their mouth usually

2681.06 --> 2686.13
and so to me it seems like okay if

2684.54 --> 2688.71
you're gonna fish then freaking eat it

2686.13 --> 2694.55
because otherwise you're just wounding

2688.71 --> 2697.38
it for your hobby sorry if I'm no well

2694.55 --> 2700.4100000000003
no I mean it can happen but that's rare

2697.38 --> 2703.02
and we look at nothing will go to waste

2700.41 --> 2704.24
I mean it'll get if a fish end up do

2703.02 --> 2707.54
losing one

2704.24 --> 2709.04
and either learn other officially I mean

2707.54 --> 2711.14
it won't go it away there's nothing that

2709.04 --> 2714.47
dyes it yeah you got a good point there

2711.14 --> 2715.43
you got a good point it just seems and

2714.47 --> 2717.2599999999998
believe me I don't like it either I

2715.43 --> 2719.45
don't like ever hurting a fish and

2717.26 --> 2721.7900000000004
sometimes when that does happen is when

2719.45 --> 2725.859
I will keep it to eat it because I

2721.79 --> 2725.859
that's better that's better

2730.15 --> 2742.099
son broke through again very nice yeah

2737.109 --> 2743.54
long winter ahead of us well you're

2742.099 --> 2747.67
right there are some free controls on

2743.54 --> 2750.65
that chatting yeah they love this place

2747.67 --> 2753.349
keeps them busy now it's especially

2750.65 --> 2756.559
after I've showed myself my phone are

2753.349 --> 2759.829
all vulnerable spots which is extremely

2756.559 --> 2761.78
unusual for somebody in my position to

2759.829 --> 2763.9700000000003
do that without literally being

2761.78 --> 2767.3590000000004
permanently out of control because most

2763.97 --> 2769.16
people that show their the painful

2767.359 --> 2770.8089999999997
sights like that are usually just

2769.16 --> 2773.6299999999997
permanently out of control and there's

2770.809 --> 2776.4500000000003
nothing else they can I can but it's

2773.63 --> 2779.75
extremely unusual and yeah as soon as I

2776.45 --> 2782.8999999999996
show signs again of recovering they've

2779.75 --> 2784.22
all been silent during when I was like

2782.9 --> 2786.02
that because they know how scary it is

2784.22 --> 2787.97
but now they got some catching up to do

2786.02 --> 2789.5
now they're like oh yeah oh wait we

2787.97 --> 2793.45
remember that he actually showed

2789.5 --> 2798.549
weakness so now now we're gonna just

2793.45 --> 2801.23
full troll the [ __ ] out of him again

2798.549 --> 2803.9
because that's what they do every single

2801.23 --> 2806.809
time it's always the same person Assyria

2803.9 --> 2809.059
same people every time I have like weak

2806.809 --> 2811.1600000000003
moments and it's not the first time weak

2809.059 --> 2814.369
moments moments suffering you could call

2811.16 --> 2817.43
it as soon as I restore the same people

2814.369 --> 2819.1400000000003
come in the chat like a bunch of

2817.43 --> 2821.24
psychopathic leeches

2819.14 --> 2826.0099999999998
trying to suck up the remnants of the

2821.24 --> 2829.1899999999996
pain somehow always there every time you

2826.01 --> 2832.099
know who you are you only ever come and

2829.19 --> 2834.64
appear every time after I felt really

2832.099 --> 2837.6400000000003
bad and then you come and show and troll

2834.64 --> 2840.17
you know who you are

2837.64 --> 2843.77
because they don't really care about me

2840.17 --> 2847.67
they just want to break me really just

2843.77 --> 2849.83
want to permanently go away and they can

2847.67 --> 2852.619
say it as all the we what just want you

2849.83 --> 2856.49
to be happy Arwen you seem so unhappy

2852.619 --> 2857.3
doing this why don't you just go away so

2856.49 --> 2865.6099999999997
easy

2857.3 --> 2868.07
oh no no no doing this is probably one

2865.61 --> 2871.34
of the few redemptions that has managed

2868.07 --> 2873.77
helped me manage to retain what is left

2871.34 --> 2880.55
of my sanity okay that sounded very

2873.77 --> 2884.83
dramatic but it is kind of true pathetic

2880.55 --> 2889.52
their lives are I can't even imagine I

2884.83 --> 2891.56
seriously can I can't believe that some

2889.52 --> 2894.68
of these people with all their behaviors

2891.56 --> 2899.18
and all just have jobs and even wives

2894.68 --> 2902.2999999999997
and kids and I'm just like how is this

2899.18 --> 2906.02
even possible how can a person be like

2902.3 --> 2910.369
this and have all that it just spells

2906.02 --> 2916.49
disaster to me I just can't let it get

2910.369 --> 2920.33
to you no they're not I'm just baffled

2916.49 --> 2923.5099999999998
by it like how could fate roll out that

2920.33 --> 2928.79
situation it just seems like that is an

2923.51 --> 2931.7000000000003
insane contrast and it doesn't promise a

2928.79 --> 2934.04
lot of good you know if you're on the

2931.7 --> 2937.9399999999996
path of supposedly logo's with family

2934.04 --> 2940.52
job and trying to do good things and you

2937.94 --> 2943.869
then go to the other side and just spend

2940.52 --> 2947.869
a lot of your free time to be nasty and

2943.869 --> 2951.859
to push people down that will avenge

2947.869 --> 2956.7200000000003
itself so horrifically later in life you

2951.859 --> 2960.04
can even begin to imagine okay if you

2956.72 --> 2962.7799999999997
think that my punishment retro my

2960.04 --> 2964.7
afterword punishment of logos because of

2962.78 --> 2966.26
the stupidity that I committed when I

2964.7 --> 2968.77
was younger in idiotic

2966.26 --> 2974.869
ideas I had that I

2968.77 --> 2977.06
guide me to bypass normal logos if you

2974.869 --> 2981.619
think that this punishment is bad I'll

2977.06 --> 2984.349
just just wait 2040 years when all your

2981.619 --> 2985.67
kids are grown up and everybody's gotten

2984.349 --> 2988.96
to know who you really are

2985.67 --> 2991.34
and you slipped into the deepest region

2988.96 --> 2994.88
you have no idea what's gonna happen

2991.34 --> 3007.57
after that am I able to drop you a

2994.88 --> 3010.119
picture in Skype how do I do that ah I'm

3007.57 --> 3012.28
gonna show you the curve you have to if

3010.119 --> 3016.27
you want to present it then you gotta go

3012.28 --> 3018.0400000000004
us say screen share cinema I want to

3016.27 --> 3019.81
give it to you and then you even you can

3018.04 --> 3022.9
do it if you want okay I'll try

3019.81 --> 3024.5499999999997
sure so we're you gotta tell me where to

3022.9 --> 3030.31
go I just the first time ever you Skype

3024.55 --> 3032.23
so oh where where are you putting it so

3030.31 --> 3037.359
you can leave in the chat I I'm not

3032.23 --> 3040.21
seeing it why are you so just go to

3037.359 --> 3043.2999999999997
gallery or where I go okay there we go

3040.21 --> 3047.43
not just in Skype in Eden in our

3043.3 --> 3051.01
one-on-one conversation you click the

3047.43 --> 3056.2
there there yeah um oh now do you see a

3051.01 --> 3057.76
curve there oh yeah nice I had someone

3056.2 --> 3062.8799999999997
sent me that once I just thought it was

3057.76 --> 3062.88
funny a sec you I mean that's a good one

3063.51 --> 3073.9500000000003
yeah yeah I definitely go for that

3068.91 --> 3079.17
that's a curve I don't I don't mind a a

3073.95 --> 3082.8689999999997
what is it a but and lack legs

3079.17 --> 3085.9900000000002
projection based map no problem with

3082.869 --> 3088.33
that whatsoever no sometimes you got to

3085.99 --> 3090.4599999999996
have fun right right and it seems also

3088.33 --> 3092.8489999999997
if I look at this map that the

3090.46 --> 3095.859
Netherlands is at a particularly

3092.849 --> 3098.599
favorable location anyway they're not

3095.859 --> 3105.019
there Darren everyone asking about

3098.599 --> 3110.7200000000003
yet nobody can see the curve yeah beats

3105.019 --> 3112.0989999999997
wanted to see it no beats can see it and

3110.72 --> 3118.009
if anyone can't take a little bit of

3112.099 --> 3122.599
humor manic and his buzz on yeah like

3118.009 --> 3124.069
that's only curve you find if there's

3122.599 --> 3125.6600000000003
like an thing I mean I talk about a lot

3124.069 --> 3127.549
of pilots and stuff like that too about

3125.66 --> 3129.44
this and that's the one thing I just

3127.549 --> 3133.519
keep asking show me that freaking curve

3129.44 --> 3134.96
me no one can do it nobody I mean I had

3133.519 --> 3137.72
pilots that flew you know that I've

3134.96 --> 3139.19
talked to that phone I mean I mean well

3137.72 --> 3141.2
you know I prone that seventy eighty

3139.19 --> 3143.869
thousand feet or whatever or however I

3141.2 --> 3146.989
mean way up there and they they know II

3143.869 --> 3149.4790000000003
don't see it like one guy said that we

3146.989 --> 3153.95
start to see it later you see that see

3149.479 --> 3156.859
the curve or you don't you know but no

3153.95 --> 3158.839
one can no one can show it I've tried to

3156.859 --> 3162.319
debate the professor on it

3158.839 --> 3163.729
you know on the curve calculator to

3162.319 --> 3165.89
eight inches per mile squared you know

3163.729 --> 3168.5589999999997
come back she's a freaking professor at

3165.89 --> 3172.1299999999997
a university here and I'm stupid I mean

3168.559 --> 3173.9
I'd not you know I just you bring out

3172.13 --> 3178.4300000000003
the truth and they you know no one can

3173.9 --> 3182.63
stand up to yeah right and if you're

3178.43 --> 3185.839
lucky and not on camera or anything then

3182.63 --> 3187.849
if you get a right teacher or whatever

3185.839 --> 3193.5789999999997
at a university he will actually tell

3187.849 --> 3197.029
you yeah yeah just just don't mention

3193.579 --> 3199.2490000000003
that I said that it but else they'll

3197.029 --> 3200.719
still like yeah we kind of know I think

3199.249 --> 3203.269
there's probably a lot of teachers in

3200.719 --> 3208.19
there that do realize like oh yeah

3203.269 --> 3209.66
that's well you got to teach this cuz

3208.19 --> 3211.099
when I was asking on both the curve she

3209.66 --> 3212.479
actually was gonna cause it kind of

3211.099 --> 3214.039
stumped her and I said told her both

3212.479 --> 3215.5989999999997
eight inches per mile square and stuff

3214.039 --> 3218.029
so she was gonna go do it a couple

3215.599 --> 3220.5190000000002
colleagues get some information answer

3218.029 --> 3222.38
some questions and come back and kind of

3220.519 --> 3225.2
debate me about the topic and I never

3222.38 --> 3233.73
heard from her again that was it

3225.2 --> 3238.589
that was it right yeah well for me I

3233.73 --> 3242.13
usually recognize like very smart

3238.589 --> 3244.65
teachers from well baller fanatics

3242.13 --> 3247.02
teachers very quickly because of their

3244.65 --> 3249.96
overall stance the way they compose

3247.02 --> 3252.349
themselves the way they respond the

3249.96 --> 3255.089
methods that they apply in trying to

3252.349 --> 3258.3590000000004
make others adapt usually more

3255.089 --> 3261.9
autocratic more peer pressure based so

3258.359 --> 3265.859
and I tend to recognize them even before

3261.9 --> 3268.29
I hear their opinions about the globe

3265.859 --> 3269.64
earth versus flat and just even hear it

3268.29 --> 3274.32
in their voice like their entire

3269.64 --> 3279.2999999999997
composure migrates to that and it

3274.32 --> 3281.52
happens automatically have you ever

3279.3 --> 3284.3390000000004
noticed that absolutely

3281.52 --> 3287.06
triggered response right but not just

3284.339 --> 3289.589
that it's also their personal composure

3287.06 --> 3293.13
the methods that they start to apply the

3289.589 --> 3297.15
way they start to talk that I I think

3293.13 --> 3300.3900000000003
that a lot of them actually manipulate

3297.15 --> 3303.599
the way they present themselves just to

3300.39 --> 3306.33
get in more favor with people so they

3303.599 --> 3309.1800000000003
get literally political about their own

3306.33 --> 3310.98
personality eventually because you want

3309.18 --> 3311.79
to win they want to win win win win no

3310.98 --> 3316.47
matter what

3311.79 --> 3318.63
even though they can ever yeah I mean

3316.47 --> 3320.97
it's ego and pride mm-hmm

3318.63 --> 3323.25
you know and that's the first thing when

3320.97 --> 3325.29
you want to come into this the truth

3323.25 --> 3327.2
movement is what I like to call it you

3325.29 --> 3328.98
got to put that ego at the door man

3327.2 --> 3331.56
because if you don't get rid of it

3328.98 --> 3332.88
you're gonna just stay dumb down so if

3331.56 --> 3335.94
you don't get rid of it it's gonna get

3332.88 --> 3337.44
rid of you absolutely there's no way to

3335.94 --> 3342.3
see the truth until you take off the

3337.44 --> 3346.55
blinders man not or or just take the

3342.3 --> 3346.55
Peyton that's really the big first step

3346.64 --> 3353.46
I guess you gotta you gotta face it and

3350.089 --> 3355.29
facing it is pain usually if you haven't

3353.46 --> 3357.119
done it yet if you haven't overcome that

3355.29 --> 3358.44
yet then it usually starts with that and

3357.119 --> 3360.7200000000003
that is also that

3358.44 --> 3361.77
that fear of that pain and thinking you

3360.72 --> 3364.0789999999997
could never handle it

3361.77 --> 3367.38
you could never manage yourself after

3364.079 --> 3370.4100000000003
that that is what is like it's like a

3367.38 --> 3371.88
visceral fear to a lot of ballers they

3370.41 --> 3373.95
can just never go there

3371.88 --> 3375.599
right I mean even when you listen to

3373.95 --> 3377.73
some of these guys that debate Don not

3375.599 --> 3380.88
eat or what qee or needs and Oakley I

3377.73 --> 3382.829
mean and I'm talking about some other

3380.88 --> 3385.6800000000003
smarter people on the opposite side of

3382.829 --> 3387.9
us it's the same points that they bring

3385.68 --> 3390.0299999999997
up that just get demolished but these

3387.9 --> 3393.089
just can't get past that same point that

3390.03 --> 3396.75
they know doesn't work no matter what

3393.089 --> 3398.97
that point is you know I mean there's

3396.75 --> 3402.78
some smart PA I got a run out of this

3398.97 --> 3404.819
