but now it's clouded again

141.599 --> 144.92

into

243.599 --> 246.79899999999998
turned out fine

246.959 --> 253.76

256.88 --> 260.12
[Music]

262.37 --> 265.649

284.16 --> 287.90000000000003
somebody from Maui

288.419 --> 293.94
on the show to basically elaborately

291.18 --> 297.0
talk about what's going on down there

293.94 --> 300.84
and like what the overall situation was

297.0 --> 304.82
like before fires and like oh yeah it

300.84 --> 304.82

Supreme knowing let's see you

413.759 --> 416.72
are you all doing

442.819 --> 447.36
what your phone got stolen

445.86 --> 451.22
what the [ __ ]

447.36 --> 451.22
well that sucks for him knowing

460.199 --> 467.599
I hope you didn't have like too much

463.699 --> 467.599
private stuff on it

476.819 --> 482.3
yeah but sorry to hear that that really

480.06 --> 482.3
sucks

486.36 --> 490.259
I don't really have an active phone

488.22 --> 493.68
though

490.259 --> 495.96000000000004
and I'm also starting to suspect like

493.68 --> 498.74
no for some reason the alarm clock isn't

495.96 --> 498.73999999999995
functioning either

500.4 --> 503.599
it's really weird

508.56 --> 515.18
lost all the phone numbers

510.5 --> 515.18
right yes yeah that sucks

522.3 --> 527.0999999999999
low borders boy

524.219 --> 530.519
did I hear Nathan is debating jiren yes

527.1 --> 532.32
yeah Nathan talked about that yesterday

530.519 --> 534.66
on the show so

532.32 --> 535.5
or was it no not yesterday the day

534.66 --> 538.8399999999999
before

535.5 --> 540.6
so yeah that was discussed elaborately

538.84 --> 544.08
[Music]

540.6 --> 546.9590000000001
but it's not a debate though I think

544.08 --> 549.9200000000001
it's more like having a

546.959 --> 549.92
a conversation

551.64 --> 557.04
I mean I don't think Jaron would

553.44 --> 559.6800000000001
actually like be capable of winning an

557.04 --> 563.06
actual debate with Nathan I don't think

559.68 --> 563.06
he is and he knows that

577.2 --> 583.22
right anyway

579.959 --> 583.2199999999999
yeah we'll see what happens

600.0 --> 603.42
yeah I don't really know what to talk

601.74 --> 607.4590000000001
about right now

603.42 --> 607.459
and I'm very distracted

607.98 --> 610.1
thank you

610.32 --> 613.82
tonight yeah yeah

617.22 --> 622.399
I just I kind of hope that I got that I

620.22 --> 626.339
would have gotten more support yesterday

622.399 --> 627.72
making like the title of the second part

626.339 --> 630.12
of the show

627.72 --> 632.82
support your local Arwin

630.12 --> 635.519
and I mean I'm very very thankful for

632.82 --> 638.0400000000001
what I got from dank but I mean that's

635.519 --> 639.24
like barely gonna get me dinner for two

638.04 --> 642.06
days

639.24 --> 644.04
and yeah I am gonna be running out of

642.06 --> 646.38
smoke where

644.04 --> 648.779
which I'm not looking forward to like

646.38 --> 651.66
even if I did get any donations now I

648.779 --> 653.9399999999999
wouldn't be able to change that

651.66 --> 656.3389999999999
only tomorrow

653.94 --> 659.12
so yeah today is gonna be like a tight

656.339 --> 659.12
day for me

661.32 --> 666.72
and I really hope to get some support in

663.48 --> 669.1800000000001
otherwise it's gonna be like that

666.72 --> 671.9590000000001
for the rest of the week

669.18 --> 671.959
and

672.839 --> 675.0300000000001
I don't want to do a show in that

674.579 --> 678.4399999999999
condition

675.03 --> 678.4399999999999
[Music]

679.92 --> 682.92
foreign

697.7 --> 703.5
yeah the problem is I can't just get

700.62 --> 706.86
stuck up all around on 80 bucks on my

703.5 --> 709.68
food like I can get dinner with that

706.86 --> 710.94
but then I can't get bread and eggs for

709.68 --> 713.3389999999999
lunch

710.94 --> 715.62
which is the cheapest option let alone

713.339 --> 718.2790000000001
Illuminati Customs yeah you can't forget

715.62 --> 718.279
about that

718.32 --> 722.82
unless I'm okay with skipping dinner

720.6 --> 726.24
entirely like I don't have french fries

722.82 --> 729.0600000000001
anymore either like I am clean out

726.24 --> 731.279
so I have to pick very carefully

729.06 --> 733.92
what I'm going to be eating

731.279 --> 736.62
in the next two days

733.92 --> 737.899
unless I get a lot of support and then

736.62 --> 741.24
tomorrow

737.899 --> 743.54
I should be able to like stock up on

741.24 --> 743.54
stuff

748.98 --> 753.9200000000001
so guys please help me out if you can

755.12 --> 761.779
it's like even if everybody like sends

757.98 --> 761.779
five bucks or something that should help

762.12 --> 767.66
uh and I'm sorry

764.459 --> 767.66
and I have to be so

767.7 --> 772.22
begging

769.32 --> 772.22
for this [ __ ]

783.26 --> 789.6
I would really like to just

787.44 --> 791.8800000000001
continue just talking about Flat Earth

789.6 --> 796.0400000000001
and explaining

791.88 --> 796.04
I was very satisfied with my show

796.68 --> 801.3199999999999
that was all focused on Flat Earth two

798.839 --> 801.32
days ago

802.019 --> 807.36
I mean I I really would like to do a lot

805.38 --> 810.36
of that sort of thing but I mean you

807.36 --> 812.639
guys in here of course like you've all

810.36 --> 815.22
heard that to no end I I don't really

812.639 --> 817.32
need I'd be preaching to the choir if I

815.22 --> 819.9200000000001
if I kept explaining that stuff to you

817.32 --> 819.9200000000001
right

834.6 --> 842.16
and I don't know yet I mean

839.54 --> 844.1999999999999
cosmoginy speculation like what are the

842.16 --> 848.279
dimensions of the realm what's the

844.2 --> 851.279
orientation of the surface

848.279 --> 853.2
but there's nothing right now that

851.279 --> 855.959
really stands out that'll make like

853.2 --> 858.9590000000001
there's no item

855.959 --> 862.9799999999999
that could make me insert

858.959 --> 865.079
what the realm could be as an overlay

862.98 --> 868.0790000000001
there's no item right now if there must

865.079 --> 872.18
be some item there were to be some item

868.079 --> 872.18
like about the South Pole or something

873.019 --> 879.0600000000001
then I could unleash my speculation or

876.12 --> 881.72
if something like disappeared in at the

879.06 --> 881.7199999999999
North Pole

882.06 --> 886.7399999999999
right if if like a ship goes somewhere

884.76 --> 888.72
in the North Pole sea and it like

886.74 --> 891.5600000000001
completely disappears

888.72 --> 891.5600000000001
off the map

891.72 --> 898.36
that would be very fascinating

895.32 --> 902.1
because like where did it go then

898.36 --> 905.0
[Music]

902.1 --> 905.0
anyway

905.22 --> 908.22
foreign

913.76 --> 919.62
by the way all kinds of weird mixed

916.8 --> 922.56
stories concerning Maui I mean they're

919.62 --> 925.76
like people's imaginations have gone

922.56 --> 925.76
pretty wild over it

929.04 --> 934.92
but yeah they the guests

932.04 --> 937.88
that was on with Owen like he even like

934.92 --> 937.88
laid it out like

943.68 --> 947.959
were there even that many people killed

948.06 --> 952.5
like I think it's they're like

949.98 --> 955.26
pretending like everybody died in their

952.5 --> 960.199
houses or something but

955.26 --> 960.199
how many actually did were there even

961.56 --> 967.92
it's all kind of fuzzy like I don't know

965.279 --> 969.24
but the guy said that like no it wasn't

967.92 --> 973.519
like it

969.24 --> 973.519
like the dozens of people died

974.5 --> 978.72
[Music]

975.959 --> 980.6389999999999
in the meantime there's like the idea of

978.72 --> 983.5790000000001
that somebody lit it

980.639 --> 987.72
and and on the Alex Jones Show yesterday

983.579 --> 990.5999999999999
they were they had some other

987.72 --> 993.1800000000001
line of input that was saying that for

990.6 --> 995.5790000000001
some reasons alarms didn't go off well

993.18 --> 999.18
that was actually on video

995.579 --> 1000.2589999999999
so there was no Firestorm alarm or

999.18 --> 1003.079
anything

1000.259 --> 1005.779
even though there is a system on Maui

1003.079 --> 1009.079
for that it didn't go off at all even

1005.779 --> 1011.899
while it was all burning

1009.079 --> 1015.8
and that also weirdly enough they hadn't

1011.899 --> 1018.56
turned down the electric lines

1015.8 --> 1021.3199999999999
during the storm

1018.56 --> 1022.5189999999999
which is standard procedure

1021.32 --> 1024.5
so

1022.519 --> 1026.72
from that

1024.5 --> 1029.0
stream of information I got the idea

1026.72 --> 1032.1200000000001
that basically

1029.0 --> 1034.459
they they created the conditions for the

1032.12 --> 1038.059
Calamity to happen

1034.459 --> 1040.939
and apparently even like Klaus Schwab is

1038.059 --> 1043.3999999999999
indirectly like

1040.939 --> 1044.72
owns the electric company there it's

1043.4 --> 1047.72
crazy

1044.72 --> 1050.14
that's what I've heard from that side of

1047.72 --> 1050.14
media

1050.419 --> 1057.14
so yeah I don't really know what to

1053.059 --> 1059.32
think about it it's all just very hyped

1057.14 --> 1059.3200000000002
foreign

1067.28 --> 1073.3999999999999
but it does overall from any perspective

1071.299 --> 1076.8799999999999
look like there is

1073.4 --> 1081.6200000000001
like there has been effort made for

1076.88 --> 1081.6200000000001
some kind of a land grab attempt

1082.34 --> 1086.84
because like the real the Richies like

1085.039 --> 1088.82
they might just sell their house and

1086.84 --> 1092.84
just move on or whatever

1088.82 --> 1096.3799999999999
but the locals there like they

1092.84 --> 1098.6
they they will never go away like it's

1096.38 --> 1100.88
their ancestral Homeland or they

1098.6 --> 1102.98
consider it as such

1100.88 --> 1104.7800000000002
and they are not gonna go away for

1102.98 --> 1107.96
anything

1104.78 --> 1110.62
so this Firestorm hit them the hardest

1107.96 --> 1110.6200000000001
probably

1112.22 --> 1116.14
because they can't go anywhere

1116.6 --> 1121.3999999999999
like they don't they're not billionaires

1118.46 --> 1123.26
they can't just like oh I'll just

1121.4 --> 1125.8600000000001
I'll just go to one of my other houses

1123.26 --> 1125.86
then

1125.96 --> 1131.44
right

1127.94 --> 1131.44
hey dank good to see you

1137.9 --> 1143.96
right so there's yeah the storm of

1141.38 --> 1146.44
information is going around concerning

1143.96 --> 1146.44
Maui

1151.1 --> 1155.3799999999999
Oprah's house and torch yeah yeah

1161.72 --> 1168.32
no but

1163.4 --> 1170.6000000000001
Obama yeah but to be fair dank like it

1168.32 --> 1172.76
wasn't like the entirety of Maui burned

1170.6 --> 1174.86
down it was like only five percent or

1172.76 --> 1178.24
something

1174.86 --> 1178.24
and there's plenty of houses

1181.419 --> 1187.039
all celebrity houses I'm not sure if all

1185.179 --> 1190.0590000000002
celebrity houses are still standing

1187.039 --> 1190.059
Supreme knowing

1202.28 --> 1208.76
but look even if those houses didn't

1205.58 --> 1212.12
weren't Still Standing they'd probably

1208.76 --> 1214.84
get it get it all they have it all

1212.12 --> 1214.84
insured anyway

1219.76 --> 1225.74
so other than them not being able to

1223.52 --> 1227.059
live in those houses anymore for a long

1225.74 --> 1230.1200000000001
time

1227.059 --> 1232.6
the celebrities wouldn't really care all

1230.12 --> 1232.6
that much

1235.22 --> 1240.2
so it's mostly the the people that are

1237.799 --> 1243.08
are not celebrities not super rich that

1240.2 --> 1244.46
have really saved up to have a house

1243.08 --> 1246.08
there and live there

1244.46 --> 1248.74
those are the ones that are getting

1246.08 --> 1248.74
really hit

1249.919 --> 1256.94
because they have nowhere to go

1253.58 --> 1259.82
and it might take ages before any

1256.94 --> 1261.5
insurance pays out for the fire damage

1259.82 --> 1263.96
and where are they gonna live in the

1261.5 --> 1267.679
meantime you know

1263.96 --> 1270.94
like how are they gonna make a living

1267.679 --> 1270.94
not having a house

1277.1 --> 1279.6399999999999
all right

1286.16 --> 1288.76
foreign

1309.14 --> 1312.8200000000002
yeah that's pretty that's crazy

1313.039 --> 1318.02
but I mean

1314.539 --> 1321.32
a firestorm is like pretty insane though

1318.02 --> 1323.48
so yeah I mean once that gets going it's

1321.32 --> 1325.82
like having a torch

1323.48 --> 1329.38
and like everything turns into a

1325.82 --> 1329.3799999999999
blowtorch like everything

1334.28 --> 1341.6
and yeah if if that basically maneuvers

1338.78 --> 1343.7
through a tunnel then yeah the stuff in

1341.6 --> 1347.1999999999998
the tunnels eventually also gonna turn

1343.7 --> 1347.2
into a blowtorch so

1354.679 --> 1359.72
energy weapons I don't know about that

1357.32 --> 1360.45
Supreme knowing I don't know about that

1359.72 --> 1363.579
at all

1360.45 --> 1363.579
[Music]

1366.74 --> 1373.94
I mean it doesn't look like those town

1370.94 --> 1375.8600000000001
that town in California

1373.94 --> 1379.159
right

1375.86 --> 1382.9399999999998
it looked like burnt out cars

1379.159 --> 1387.0200000000002
burned out houses but it wasn't like it

1382.94 --> 1387.02
was all completely disintegrated

1390.74 --> 1395.1200000000001
and with with the trees just having

1393.14 --> 1397.4
leaves right next to it yeah there were

1395.12 --> 1400.52
three standing and the sap in those

1397.4 --> 1402.5
trees are argued to have it

1400.52 --> 1405.62
be able to survive that kind of

1402.5 --> 1407.72
Firestorm although pretty scorched it's

1405.62 --> 1408.62
not like no leaves were burned or

1407.72 --> 1410.539
anything

1408.62 --> 1415.84
but I mean

1410.539 --> 1415.84
cars were not puddles of liquid metal

1416.6 --> 1423.02
they're still like houses

1420.2 --> 1424.4
like pieces of it sticking out having

1423.02 --> 1427.76
been burned

1424.4 --> 1430.2800000000002
right it's not literally completely like

1427.76 --> 1434.0
cut off at the ground

1430.28 --> 1435.9189999999999
like it was totally disintegrated so I

1434.0 --> 1437.179
don't know about those directed energy

1435.919 --> 1439.7
weapons

1437.179 --> 1442.5800000000002
I mean a firestorm

1439.7 --> 1444.44
is like

1442.58 --> 1446.8999999999999
I mean the only thing I could imagine

1444.44 --> 1449.8400000000001
would be that would be more devastating

1446.9 --> 1451.52
than a firestorm would be a pyroclastic

1449.84 --> 1453.9189999999999
flow

1451.52 --> 1456.62
this is

1453.919 --> 1458.8400000000001
which is so it's terrible it literally

1456.62 --> 1460.4799999999998
like completely

1458.84 --> 1462.86
just

1460.48 --> 1466.52
displaces ground and Earth and

1462.86 --> 1467.32
everything it's like a giant scoop that

1466.52 --> 1470.539
just

1467.32 --> 1474.86
completely trashes everything

1470.539 --> 1477.86
ground and all but yeah firestorms are

1474.86 --> 1480.1589999999999
pretty heavy I don't I don't I have not

1477.86 --> 1482.7199999999998
seen anything

1480.159 --> 1486.1000000000001
decisively convincing that directed

1482.72 --> 1486.1000000000001
energy weapons were involved

1488.12 --> 1492.799
I know they love to show stuff but you

1491.48 --> 1496.4
don't know

1492.799 --> 1498.62
like when that was where that was

1496.4 --> 1501.0800000000002
people could just be like

1498.62 --> 1503.9599999999998
filming that and it was somewhere else

1501.08 --> 1506.1789999999999
and then they're like oh this is Maui

1503.96 --> 1508.4
just to get huge amounts of attention

1506.179 --> 1511.659
and get conspiracy rolling you don't

1508.4 --> 1511.659
know I don't know

1513.679 --> 1517.76
I mean people dude

1518.419 --> 1523.039
at this point

1520.159 --> 1524.96
the way things are going out there

1523.039 --> 1527.72
like

1524.96 --> 1531.559
somebody could throw a uh a cigarette

1527.72 --> 1532.4
butt in the trash can it goes on fire it

1531.559 --> 1534.98
will

1532.4 --> 1536.9
get to people's attention people will

1534.98 --> 1540.46
say it was lit by a directed energy

1536.9 --> 1540.46
weapon okay

1540.62 --> 1544.6399999999999
it's like there's no fire anymore

1542.539 --> 1547.7
without directed energy weapons being

1544.64 --> 1549.94
the cause of them I mean dude this

1547.7 --> 1554.1200000000001
morning I

1549.94 --> 1555.2
I was like rolling and joining and I lit

1554.12 --> 1558.26
it up

1555.2 --> 1560.179
but my lighter didn't work so then a

1558.26 --> 1562.1589999999999
directed energy weapon

1560.179 --> 1564.14
came down from the heaven and lit my

1562.159 --> 1566.74
cigarette

1564.14 --> 1566.74
okay

1573.32 --> 1575.86
so

1582.86 --> 1588.799
yes but you're right slo-mo I mean yeah

1585.5 --> 1592.76
celebrity houses because they're not

1588.799 --> 1594.98
near the locals celebrity houses are

1592.76 --> 1596.0
like fortresses they're away from

1594.98 --> 1599.059
everything

1596.0 --> 1601.22
they don't like their celebrity house in

1599.059 --> 1603.799
the middle of a local region because

1601.22 --> 1606.08
then they'd feel like the youths or

1603.799 --> 1609.1
whatever would start sneaking into their

1606.08 --> 1609.1
Gardens and [ __ ]

1609.14 --> 1614.9
right because they're right next door

1611.9 --> 1616.8200000000002
they don't like that celebrities so they

1614.9 --> 1620.96
built their houses their Mansions like

1616.82 --> 1623.2
fortresses away from from the towns and

1620.96 --> 1623.2
[ __ ]

1626.12 --> 1630.3799999999999
so yeah of course celebrity houses are

1629.12 --> 1633.1999999999998
still standing

1630.38 --> 1635.6000000000001
if the entire Island will have would

1633.2 --> 1637.7
have been burnt down yeah then the

1635.6 --> 1640.52
celebrity houses would have been it

1637.7 --> 1642.2
but it's not the entire Island that was

1640.52 --> 1644.72
burned down

1642.2 --> 1648.5800000000002
it was mostly like

1644.72 --> 1648.58
Old Town region

1651.26 --> 1655.419
and I think it's a lot more likely that

1656.659 --> 1661.279
that it either happened because of

1658.58 --> 1663.5
electrical fires because

1661.279 --> 1666.38
Cloud show up the electric company

1663.5 --> 1668.299
refused to shut the power down be

1666.38 --> 1670.8200000000002
probably it would have probably been

1668.299 --> 1674.62
sabotage the most likely thing is why

1670.82 --> 1674.62
this happened is because of sabotage

1675.38 --> 1680.24
The Conspiracy to leave the power on

1677.659 --> 1682.24
that would inevitably lead to a

1680.24 --> 1684.98
firestorm I think that that's actually

1682.24 --> 1687.32
the most likely thing that's happened no

1684.98 --> 1689.96
directed NG weapons

1687.32 --> 1693.32
no numpty

1689.96 --> 1695.419
climate activist on the ground lighting

1693.32 --> 1697.58
a fire like who would be crazy enough to

1695.419 --> 1700.72
do that anyway in the middle of a

1697.58 --> 1700.72
freaking storm like that

1701.12 --> 1706.4599999999998
I mean you'd have to be pretty freaking

1703.279 --> 1708.44
Brave actually to like like during a

1706.46 --> 1710.72
tornado storm

1708.44 --> 1713.179
go outside

1710.72 --> 1715.48
find the right spot and then light it up

1713.179 --> 1715.48
do

1717.559 --> 1723.44
that's a very easy way to get yourself

1720.5 --> 1726.799
killed right so it's just all very

1723.44 --> 1729.14
unlikely directed energy weapons uh yeah

1726.799 --> 1731.4189999999999
here's the dumbass part

1729.14 --> 1733.3400000000001
of course now of course Alex Jones

1731.419 --> 1735.8600000000001
suggests all directed ugly weapons have

1733.34 --> 1737.32
to come from settling is it from

1735.86 --> 1740.799
from

1737.32 --> 1744.6789999999999
space in a particle weapons

1740.799 --> 1748.46
[ __ ] yeah directed energy weapons

1744.679 --> 1751.039
are short range weapons

1748.46 --> 1753.2
and they're mostly delivered by

1751.039 --> 1755.48
helicopter yeah

1753.2 --> 1758.559
there's no helicopters gonna go around

1755.48 --> 1758.559
during a tornado

1759.14 --> 1766.0
the chances that directed energy weapons

1761.779 --> 1771.58
were involved in the Maui fire fire

1766.0 --> 1771.58
are extremely slim at best

1772.88 --> 1778.3400000000001
there's no freaking satellites

1775.52 --> 1781.76
directed energy weapons are not super

1778.34 --> 1784.82
long range at all

1781.76 --> 1787.52
right it's just like the same

1784.82 --> 1790.039
shoes even with lasers I mean lasers

1787.52 --> 1792.98
reach farther because they're so they're

1790.039 --> 1794.72
made to be so freaking parallel erected

1792.98 --> 1798.02
energy weapons are

1794.72 --> 1800.659
like particle weapons it spreads out so

1798.02 --> 1803.74
the further the distance the less

1800.659 --> 1803.74
effective it's going to be

1805.58 --> 1809.62
I think directed energy weapon

1811.159 --> 1815.98
could like

1812.899 --> 1819.6999999999998
function at maybe

1815.98 --> 1819.7
200 meters

1821.059 --> 1825.26
right

1822.14 --> 1827.8990000000001
that's like a reasonable distance for a

1825.26 --> 1830.44
typical helicopter

1827.899 --> 1830.4399999999998
like

1830.48 --> 1836.6200000000001
you can't do it from a mile away

1834.02 --> 1836.62
okay

1836.84 --> 1844.8799999999999
I mean you'd have to have like a

1839.919 --> 1847.039
doomsday Weapon Station Fortress

1844.88 --> 1849.0200000000002
to be able to do it from that kind of

1847.039 --> 1852.98
distance you would have to have like a

1849.02 --> 1855.44
giant beam thingy and then it's like oh

1852.98 --> 1857.419
I said again on fire at a Mile's

1855.44 --> 1858.8600000000001
distance yeah that's gonna be a huge

1857.419 --> 1861.5
freaking device

1858.86 --> 1863.779
it's gonna be very apparent that it's

1861.5 --> 1864.74
installed there yeah you're not gonna

1863.779 --> 1869.12
have

1864.74 --> 1870.679
such a powerful device on a on a mobile

1869.12 --> 1874.1
thing

1870.679 --> 1877.279
unless it's like a ship or something

1874.1 --> 1879.26
like a really big ship might have such a

1877.279 --> 1880.94
device that it could do that over

1879.26 --> 1882.919
distance but I think there's on average

1880.94 --> 1884.3600000000001
more effective because what are you

1882.919 --> 1885.7990000000002
going to use that for anyway it's mostly

1884.36 --> 1890.899
just sabotage

1885.799 --> 1893.36
burning things like it's not useful to

1890.899 --> 1896.6589999999999
down

1893.36 --> 1900.1999999999998
an aircraft or something

1896.659 --> 1901.88
so it's all very unlikely to be directed

1900.2 --> 1905.02
energy weapons

1901.88 --> 1905.0200000000002
from what I've seen

1905.419 --> 1910.3990000000001
their short range

1907.82 --> 1913.1589999999999
and so they could never be used during

1910.399 --> 1916.039
tornadoes

1913.159 --> 1920.679
wow it's Justified for you oh thanks for

1916.039 --> 1920.679
the genius input there low fruit

1922.279 --> 1927.86
yeah so I just explained

1925.399 --> 1929.6589999999999
like summarized

1927.86 --> 1934.7199999999998
all the ideas that are going around

1929.659 --> 1934.72
about it and what it definitely isn't

1953.24 --> 1958.76
it's Justified

1956.299 --> 1962.44
yeah well it's just a fire that's most

1958.76 --> 1962.44
likely been caused by

1962.6 --> 1968.539
like purposeful negligence

1965.779 --> 1971.24
off of of the electric company

1968.539 --> 1974.0
it's sabotage from the electric company

1971.24 --> 1976.94
they didn't turn the power off

1974.0 --> 1979.64
in that specific region and so then when

1976.94 --> 1981.98
the tornado tornado flew over yeah the

1979.64 --> 1985.039
power lines got blown over

1981.98 --> 1988.1200000000001
and started to spark a fire and now the

1985.039 --> 1988.12
fire sword started

1991.94 --> 1998.24
so it's like a very black rock-like

1995.12 --> 1999.86
action what they did because this is the

1998.24 --> 2002.14
type of [ __ ] that BlackRock typically

1999.86 --> 2004.3799999999999
does right they buy the place up

2002.14 --> 2008.14
then they wait till the Calamity happens

2004.38 --> 2012.159
then they sabotage the situation

2008.14 --> 2014.26
secretly so that the Calamity will have

2012.159 --> 2017.38
maximum damage

2014.26 --> 2019.179
destroy everybody everything and then

2017.38 --> 2022.48
they buy it all up cheaply that's

2019.179 --> 2025.44
standard BlackRock tactic

2022.48 --> 2025.44
so that's

2025.659 --> 2029.5800000000002
what's roughly been happening there

2030.34 --> 2035.3799999999999
right BlackRock just wants to clear out

2033.22 --> 2037.779
all the locals that

2035.38 --> 2039.46
don't make a lot of money but they hold

2037.779 --> 2041.86
that ground and they want them out

2039.46 --> 2045.159
because they want to use Maui they want

2041.86 --> 2047.6789999999999
to turn it into like this super

2045.159 --> 2049.7400000000002
expensive billionaire

2047.679 --> 2053.32
Resort

2049.74 --> 2055.5989999999997
entertainment Resort or something to get

2053.32 --> 2057.099
just like insane amounts of money like

2055.599 --> 2059.8790000000004
that's what they really want because

2057.099 --> 2062.8590000000004
it's [ __ ] BlackRock

2059.879 --> 2066.159
right and they wanted to clear it out

2062.859 --> 2069.52
they wanted to clear out the locals it

2066.159 --> 2072.599
said five percent yeah

2069.52 --> 2072.599
something like that

2076.419 --> 2083.5
and well most of the locals lived as far

2079.899 --> 2086.46
as I what I heard in that specific five

2083.5 --> 2086.46
percent region

2086.98 --> 2092.02
and the power lines were left on which

2089.74 --> 2094.56
is which is absolutely not standard

2092.02 --> 2094.56
procedure

2095.5 --> 2100.359
I mean people directly responsible for

2097.78 --> 2103.5600000000004
that are going to go to jail

2100.359 --> 2103.56
guaranteed it

2111.52 --> 2117.3
20 kilometers

2114.28 --> 2117.3
what the [ __ ]

2118.119 --> 2123.6600000000003
directed energy lasers

2121.0 --> 2123.66
Maybe

2124.0 --> 2132.94
but I mean 20 kilometers that's

2128.64 --> 2136.06
not gonna be like a basic mobile thing

2132.94 --> 2139.68
though I mean the directed energy lasers

2136.06 --> 2139.68
it's not laser by the way

2139.72 --> 2146.3199999999997
like on helicopters

2142.48 --> 2148.9
definitely don't have 20 kilometer range

2146.32 --> 2150.28
so whatever those devices are those are

2148.9 --> 2153.3
like

2150.28 --> 2157.32
turrets or something

2153.3 --> 2157.32
diver than Navy vet

2163.24 --> 2169.0
I mean what's starting what what what is

2166.9 --> 2172.32
it doing like are they being fired like

2169.0 --> 2172.32
from a freighter or something

2174.04 --> 2178.18
if you say 20 kilometers I didn't think

2176.14 --> 2181.72
it would have that range but okay sure

2178.18 --> 2184.66
but I mean small

2181.72 --> 2186.3999999999996
units like on helicopters are not gonna

2184.66 --> 2188.7999999999997
have that range because they just don't

2186.4 --> 2191.079
have that kind of power like more range

2188.8 --> 2194.7000000000003
means more power

2191.079 --> 2194.7000000000003
you're gonna get the power somewhere

2216.3 --> 2222.54
oh my God Chad's so freaking slow today

2229.26 --> 2234.599
I mean did I say something wrong did I

2232.06 --> 2234.599
do it wrong

2239.92 --> 2244.32
a large aircraft or [ __ ] yeah

2247.0 --> 2253.359
right but I mean and large aircraft is

2250.54 --> 2255.2799999999997
probably not gonna fly over during a

2253.359 --> 2258.2799999999997
tornado

2255.28 --> 2261.78
so then it would have to be like a an

2258.28 --> 2261.78
aircraft carrier or something

2264.7 --> 2268.9199999999996
we said the power was still on yes

2269.26 --> 2275.579
the electricity weren't wasn't cut

2272.56 --> 2275.5789999999997
during the storm

2278.2 --> 2282.7599999999998
so yeah

2279.76 --> 2284.5600000000004
thanks for that info diver than Navy vet

2282.76 --> 2287.82
but I'm pretty damn sure it wasn't

2284.56 --> 2287.82
directed energy weapons

2289.9 --> 2294.359
it was just land-based sabotage

2303.94 --> 2310.66
all right and this is why

2306.94 --> 2313.2400000000002
you don't want Mega corporations owning

2310.66 --> 2315.5789999999997
all your infrastructure

2313.24 --> 2317.2
because guess what also convenience all

2315.579 --> 2319.1800000000003
just one yeah yeah you know what their

2317.2 --> 2321.8199999999997
primary objective is

2319.18 --> 2324.04
kill everybody and then buy everything

2321.82 --> 2326.92
up

2324.04 --> 2329.38
so yeah good luck

2326.92 --> 2332.859
having that Mega Corporation have

2329.38 --> 2335.079
control over all your all your

2332.859 --> 2337.72
your power and your gas and your

2335.079 --> 2342.96
infrastructure and oh it's great idea

2337.72 --> 2342.9599999999996
it's not gonna end up you dead at all

2350.38 --> 2355.78
there's direct engine weapons wouldn't

2352.599 --> 2358.3
there be signs of milk yes that did

2355.78 --> 2360.599
anybody [ __ ] pay attention to my show

2358.3 --> 2360.599
today

2360.76 --> 2366.78
or did you just roll in here flatterson

2363.94 --> 2366.78
I

2370.119 --> 2373.92
I already addressed all of this

2375.04 --> 2381.7
yes

2376.78 --> 2384.7000000000003
cars weren't melted puddles of metal

2381.7 --> 2388.3199999999997
houses weren't completely disintegrated

2384.7 --> 2388.3199999999997
to the foundation

2388.72 --> 2396.04
trees did not have leaves on them they

2393.46 --> 2397.96
were definitely scorched so it was a

2396.04 --> 2399.82
firestorm it wasn't directed energy

2397.96 --> 2403.119
weapon meltdown

2399.82 --> 2406.7400000000002
like in that town in California

2403.119 --> 2406.7400000000002
few minutes yeah okay that's fine

2416.2 --> 2422.5
it was a firestorm it's not the first

2418.599 --> 2424.9
Firestorm they had even seen I mean

2422.5 --> 2428.68
in those types of islands that have

2424.9 --> 2431.98
hurricanes or that have tornadoes

2428.68 --> 2434.5
they have firestorms too

2431.98 --> 2438.2400000000002
that does happen to them it's not the

2434.5 --> 2438.24
first time that's hit that Island

2442.18 --> 2445.48
tree fell on the power line yeah of

2444.4 --> 2448.3
course

2445.48 --> 2451.18
but that's not the issue diver that Navy

2448.3 --> 2454.0
Fed because of course trees fall on

2451.18 --> 2456.46
power lines with heavy winds

2454.0 --> 2459.7
the issue was is that the power lines

2456.46 --> 2462.339
weren't turned off which is standard

2459.7 --> 2465.46
procedure

2462.339 --> 2468.339
in case of a tornado

2465.46 --> 2471.48
and it's not that hard I mean literally

2468.339 --> 2471.48
just a guy

2472.18 --> 2478.54
basically

2474.359 --> 2481.06
goes to the station and just

2478.54 --> 2484.44
that's it

2481.06 --> 2484.44
standard procedure

2484.54 --> 2488.68
like very important standard procedure

2487.66 --> 2492.64
like

2488.68 --> 2492.64
Insurance stuff

2493.42 --> 2497.5
all rests on those types of procedures

2496.24 --> 2500.64
and

2497.5 --> 2500.64
they just didn't do it

2500.8 --> 2507.04
it's extremely suspicious and the person

2504.06 --> 2509.02
persons responsible for not shutting

2507.04 --> 2511.66
down the power are gonna end up in jail

2509.02 --> 2513.48
I guarantee it there's no way they're

2511.66 --> 2517.7999999999997
gonna be able to

2513.48 --> 2517.8
justify not turning the power off

2524.76 --> 2528.0
thank you

2528.099 --> 2534.2400000000002
right

2530.74 --> 2534.24
so as far as I'm concerned

2536.56 --> 2541.68
the direct cause of the fire has been

2539.079 --> 2541.6800000000003
established

2542.32 --> 2547.32
not directed energy weapons

2545.079 --> 2550.6600000000003
and not somebody

2547.32 --> 2553.079
manually lighting the fire either during

2550.66 --> 2553.0789999999997
the storm

2568.18 --> 2575.16
there was fire around the switch

2572.5 --> 2575.16
no

2575.68 --> 2579.18
no that's total harshit

2579.22 --> 2585.9399999999996
if there was fire around the switch

2582.28 --> 2589.9
well usually that

2585.94 --> 2593.339
kind of tends to you know shut the power

2589.9 --> 2593.339
down if like the

2595.359 --> 2601.06
if the building if the if the actual

2598.48 --> 2605.2
power generator building with the switch

2601.06 --> 2609.04
is on fire well that tends to kind of

2605.2 --> 2612.0
shut it down so no

2609.04 --> 2612.0
just know

2612.819 --> 2618.599
besides what lit the fire then

2621.28 --> 2624.0600000000004
okay

2645.16 --> 2649.98
once our King happens what are you

2647.619 --> 2649.98
talking about

2651.22 --> 2657.0
it was a tornado

2653.74 --> 2657.0
well they say

2659.319 --> 2665.88
or just just strong winds fine tornado

2662.619 --> 2665.88
just a strong wind

2670.359 --> 2675.64
yeah that's not funny love fruit

2672.819 --> 2678.599
please save your stupid gaming jokes for

2675.64 --> 2678.5989999999997
the actual games

2683.98 --> 2688.72
this slim inflaming the spinning stick

2686.38 --> 2690.819
yes LSG

2688.72 --> 2694.02
but I mean I don't think they were doing

2690.819 --> 2694.02
that during the storm

2695.7 --> 2698.8399999999997
[Music]

2707.26 --> 2710.309
[Music]

2745.24 --> 2750.72
all right anyhow

2747.76 --> 2750.7200000000003
it is what it is

2781.72 --> 2789.7799999999997
power is not cut

2784.9 --> 2789.78
okay well in Florida perhaps

2792.839 --> 2799.359
okay well then I just don't know man

2796.0 --> 2801.819
then dude maybe it was just an actor it

2799.359 --> 2804.839
was just an accident

2801.819 --> 2804.839
I I don't get it

2828.46 --> 2834.46
I I don't know May in Florida I think it

2832.48 --> 2837.04
just

2834.46 --> 2840.2200000000003
it's the air is different or I don't

2837.04 --> 2841.7799999999997
know I'm literally now like I'm entering

2840.22 --> 2843.5789999999997
a ground I don't know what the [ __ ] to

2841.78 --> 2845.44
say to you man I don't know what the

2843.579 --> 2848.8590000000004
[ __ ] to say if you say

2845.44 --> 2851.859
there is no such procedure at all

2848.859 --> 2853.9
well yeah well then a wind come by a

2851.859 --> 2856.42
landline breaks and

2853.9 --> 2859.2400000000002
a fire starts then it will just [ __ ]

2856.42 --> 2861.52
happen every time then

2859.24 --> 2864.0989999999997
what you're saying makes no sense to me

2861.52 --> 2866.64
diaper Dan Navy vet it makes no sense to

2864.099 --> 2866.6400000000003
me at all

2896.56 --> 2900.4
I mean

2897.76 --> 2904.0
like who's gonna make freaking repairs

2900.4 --> 2906.48
during a storm anyway yeah repairs comes

2904.0 --> 2906.48
afterward

2933.339 --> 2936.339
foreign

2936.74 --> 2939.87
[Music]

2976.56 --> 2982.72
so if any more for any more about that

2979.96 --> 2984.2200000000003
subject anybody has to say anything else

2982.72 --> 2986.859
about it

2984.22 --> 2989.02
about what should be and how it is

2986.859 --> 2991.06
really and what how it really worked I

2989.02 --> 2995.5
know this could anybody have anything

2991.06 --> 2998.44
else to say about the Maui fires

2995.5 --> 3001.079
or anything that remotely relates to it

2998.44 --> 3003.119
please say it now because

3001.079 --> 3005.599
like I'm running out of things to say

3003.119 --> 3005.599
about it

3017.94 --> 3023.54
okay I have no idea how many people were

3020.76 --> 3023.5400000000004
even killed

3024.599 --> 3029.119
at all

3026.16 --> 3031.2
I don't know the official procedures

3029.119 --> 3034.1400000000003
during a storm

3031.2 --> 3036.839
I it seemed to me like absolutely

3034.14 --> 3040.52
logical that you freaking shot the power

3036.839 --> 3040.52
lines down immediately

3041.0 --> 3049.099
that just seems logical to me because

3044.4 --> 3049.099
yeah it's a huge Hazard and

3049.14 --> 3055.4
like if you leave it on it can literally

3052.26 --> 3055.4
create a firestorm

3056.52 --> 3059.24
foreign

3065.579 --> 3070.2000000000003
but hey maybe the world disagrees with

3067.98 --> 3072.42
me maybe they're like no man you can't

3070.2 --> 3074.0989999999997
leave the power off that's like the

3072.42 --> 3075.599
worst thing ever

3074.099 --> 3078.2400000000002
because then you couldn't play your

3075.599 --> 3080.52
video games during the storm in this in

3078.24 --> 3083.5989999999997
the basement

3080.52 --> 3083.599
or something I don't know

3085.319 --> 3090.0
right

3087.0 --> 3092.099
so just leave it like that or not say

3090.0 --> 3096.059
anything for [ __ ] five minutes

3092.099 --> 3100.02
straight in the middle of a discussion

3096.059 --> 3103.38
right it's all great [ __ ] great doing

3100.02 --> 3106.7599999999998
a show on YouTube here at this hour

3103.38 --> 3106.76
[ __ ] great

3117.24 --> 3123.02
I'm glad I got that full attention of 26

3120.359 --> 3123.02
watching

3136.44 --> 3140.7000000000003
the aftermath restoring Powers a huge

3138.839 --> 3144.5
task

3140.7 --> 3144.5
I got some weed no

3148.38 --> 3154.38
yeah diver than anything of course it's

3151.14 --> 3156.66
restoring Powers a huge task because all

3154.38 --> 3162.38
the lines are broken and everything yeah

3156.66 --> 3162.3799999999997
it's a huge task afterward not during

3210.9 --> 3213.38
bro

3229.14 --> 3232.04
foreign

3238.04 --> 3243.8
that yeah that sounds like a

3241.02 --> 3243.8
a good job

3250.68 --> 3256.46
you just read that shedding is now it's

3253.5 --> 3256.46
horseshit dank

3259.2 --> 3265.68
isn't confirmed right

3262.26 --> 3268.38
unless you literally like spend an hour

3265.68 --> 3270.839
a day hugging the vaccinated

3268.38 --> 3273.38
it's not gonna happen

3270.839 --> 3273.38
right

3273.96 --> 3280.26
unless you're gonna exchange liquids

3277.38 --> 3281.7000000000003
it's not gonna happen don't worry about

3280.26 --> 3284.0400000000004
it I mean

3281.7 --> 3286.8799999999997
suppose it's shedding a lot of it is

3284.04 --> 3290.48
actually just like

3286.88 --> 3290.48
psychosomatic more

3294.96 --> 3301.7400000000002
so it's a myth I don't believe in

3298.079 --> 3303.96
shedding at all it's illogical

3301.74 --> 3307.74
yeah

3303.96 --> 3310.68
it's all just more create more fear more

3307.74 --> 3312.1189999999997
fear more more more be afraid be afraid

3310.68 --> 3314.7599999999998
that touching somebody else could

3312.119 --> 3318.05
literally kill you yeah that's what it

3314.76 --> 3321.159
is it's pure Fair porn

3318.05 --> 3321.159
[Music]

3329.52 --> 3332.48
you know what actually gets people

3331.14 --> 3336.859
killed

3332.48 --> 3336.859
continual stress and fear

3344.28 --> 3348.599
yeah I mean the whole thing it real like

3347.52 --> 3351.3
no

3348.599 --> 3354.3590000000004
if shedding was real then they would

3351.3 --> 3358.8
have never done it they would have never

3354.359 --> 3358.7999999999997
done this thing yeah because

3359.099 --> 3366.54
it's karmically unjustified

3362.28 --> 3370.8590000000004
they can't just uh they can't have

3366.54 --> 3375.2
random people not choosing to take a

3370.859 --> 3375.2
vaccine to get killed like that

3378.839 --> 3384.2999999999997
it's only the people that are [ __ ]

3381.599 --> 3387.079
dumb enough to for whatever reason

3384.3 --> 3392.1800000000003
taking the shot that's the only people

3387.079 --> 3392.1800000000003
that are allowed to get killed

3392.579 --> 3400.619
if shedding was real

3396.079 --> 3400.619
they'd like immediately

3400.68 --> 3407.0989999999997
like buy their own freaking Brotherhood

3402.96 --> 3409.38
they would all just be immediately tried

3407.099 --> 3412.079
like it's not allowed it doesn't work

3409.38 --> 3415.26
like that it's only people that are dumb

3412.079 --> 3418.44
enough to sign something or to agree to

3415.26 --> 3420.38
something that can be exterminated yeah

3418.44 --> 3425.88
that's how it works

3420.38 --> 3428.88
shedding cannot be real if it were real

3425.88 --> 3431.579
then all life will end and there's

3428.88 --> 3434.119
nothing you can do about it

3431.579 --> 3434.119
all right

3436.859 --> 3440.839
shedding is not real

3440.88 --> 3446.339
yeah I mean you're more likely to to

3443.94 --> 3449.339
have toxic influence from a person

3446.339 --> 3452.22
that's just so [ __ ] drugged up and

3449.339 --> 3455.94
eating polluted crap you're more likely

3452.22 --> 3458.7
to have shedding from that crap from the

3455.94 --> 3461.2200000000003
literal toxic waste that's just oozing

3458.7 --> 3464.339
through their pores rubbing off on you

3461.22 --> 3467.04
literally toxic poisoning yeah you're

3464.339 --> 3470.96
more likely to experience shedding

3467.04 --> 3470.96
from regular garbage

3472.079 --> 3477.6600000000003
yeah there's no thing

3475.079 --> 3480.1800000000003
that's gonna leak out of a vaccinated

3477.66 --> 3483.0
person that's gonna get on you and then

3480.18 --> 3486.24
Nestle itself and now you have it

3483.0 --> 3490.46
[ __ ] it's a [ __ ] lie

3486.24 --> 3490.4599999999996
it's a lie you don't have proof

3492.359 --> 3498.7799999999997
and doctors that claim them I am highly

3495.96 --> 3502.5
suspicious about really really

3498.78 --> 3506.099
suspicious about it yeah you're a doctor

3502.5 --> 3507.9
and you're talking about shedding well I

3506.099 --> 3511.4
think you're a liar and you should

3507.9 --> 3511.4
probably be arrested

3511.98 --> 3517.099
because shedding is [ __ ] [ __ ]

3517.38 --> 3523.1600000000003
yeah

3519.599 --> 3527.2400000000002
there is no thing

3523.16 --> 3531.42
that's gonna fall out of somebody else

3527.24 --> 3534.0589999999997
onto you that's gonna Nestle itself into

3531.42 --> 3538.5
you and create some weird protein

3534.059 --> 3538.5
problem yeah [ __ ]

3540.059 --> 3544.799
cat shed and dogs yeah that's the hairs

3542.28 --> 3548.7000000000003
they shed hairs yeah

3544.799 --> 3551.28
well if a cat sheds on you

3548.7 --> 3554.359
you don't suddenly start growing cat

3551.28 --> 3554.3590000000004
hairs now do you

3564.45 --> 3570.73
[Music]

3566.54 --> 3571.859
so don't be a [ __ ] dank

3570.73 --> 3574.14
[Music]

3571.859 --> 3577.5589999999997
shedding is [ __ ]

3574.14 --> 3580.859
I call it out when it first came on

3577.559 --> 3582.96
like two years ago it's [ __ ] it's

3580.859 --> 3586.0789999999997
all [ __ ]

3582.96 --> 3588.96
is no shedding

3586.079 --> 3590.3390000000004
yeah there's like psychosomatic transfer

3588.96 --> 3593.2200000000003
at best yeah you're going to hang around

3590.339 --> 3596.5789999999997
vaccinate like clearly vaccinated people

3593.22 --> 3598.68
with problems and [ __ ] and weird weird

3596.579 --> 3600.48
face issues whatever

3598.68 --> 3603.839
you're gonna hang around them all day

3600.48 --> 3605.64
long well yeah no [ __ ] you're gonna get

3603.839 --> 3607.68
weird symptoms

3605.64 --> 3609.92
because you're literally around people

3607.68 --> 3613.2
that have been like

3609.92 --> 3615.54
damaged I even arguably to a spiritual

3613.2 --> 3618.299
level they're an essential level

3615.54 --> 3621.24
it's gonna rub off on you but not

3618.299 --> 3623.099
because all the particles have dropped

3621.24 --> 3626.8799999999997
off and they got on your skin and now

3623.099 --> 3629.46
they're in you growing [ __ ]

3626.88 --> 3633.859
[ __ ] [ __ ] yeah it doesn't work

3629.46 --> 3633.859
like that it never works like that

3636.78 --> 3643.6800000000003
you're gonna contract like

3639.9 --> 3646.44
weird symptoms much more likely through

3643.68 --> 3649.2
like empathy

3646.44 --> 3651.299
and like resonance

3649.2 --> 3655.2
you're gonna resonate with somebody and

3651.299 --> 3657.42
then you might take over some of it

3655.2 --> 3660.359
you'll start to experience it yourself

3657.42 --> 3663.42
yeah that is a thousand a hundred

3660.359 --> 3667.14
thousand times more likely that there's

3663.42 --> 3670.319
any kind of thing or organism that's

3667.14 --> 3673.2599999999998
gonna fall on your skin and then seed

3670.319 --> 3676.2
itself within you

3673.26 --> 3678.96
like hiding among your flesh and

3676.2 --> 3682.46
reproducing yeah [ __ ] that

3678.96 --> 3682.46
yeah that doesn't exist

3685.079 --> 3690.619
I mean that freaking [ __ ] doesn't even

3687.299 --> 3693.839
exist with bacteria and those are like

3690.619 --> 3696.299
identified organisms and they don't even

3693.839 --> 3699.72
work like that it's [ __ ] horseshit

3696.299 --> 3701.7599999999998
it's just fair porn it's just we're

3699.72 --> 3706.0789999999997
gonna touch you you're gonna be affected

3701.76 --> 3707.2200000000003
that's all it is it's pure medical Fair

3706.079 --> 3711.1400000000003
porn

3707.22 --> 3711.14
shedding can't exist

3711.48 --> 3717.299
[Music]

3714.599 --> 3719.52
yeah if that thing

3717.299 --> 3722.46
that they claim would happen from

3719.52 --> 3724.859
shedding if it was that strong then

3722.46 --> 3727.26
people that actually had it because they

3724.859 --> 3730.14
had the shot like

3727.26 --> 3734.88
they wouldn't be able to live on

3730.14 --> 3738.0
yeah if it was that freaking like

3734.88 --> 3740.46
like a nano virus from the bark or

3738.0 --> 3741.9
something yeah oh it gets on you and

3740.46 --> 3743.64
then you get infected and starts

3741.9 --> 3745.7400000000002
reproducing it yeah yeah guess what

3743.64 --> 3747.9
you're not gonna [ __ ] walk around

3745.74 --> 3750.5989999999997
like nothing everything is normal like

3747.9 --> 3753.26
oh I got slight issues myocarditis no no

3750.599 --> 3757.619
no no if it was that [ __ ] dangerous

3753.26 --> 3760.5
you'd [ __ ] melt you'd be eaten from

3757.619 --> 3762.839
the inside from nanotech

3760.5 --> 3764.88
just consuming your orgas and

3762.839 --> 3767.2799999999997
transforming it into a gray goo or

3764.88 --> 3772.6400000000003
whatever it is right it's [ __ ]

3767.28 --> 3772.6400000000003
horseshit shedding is horseshit

3774.72 --> 3777.859
yeah graphene

3780.299 --> 3783.5
graphene oxide

3784.98 --> 3791.819
but that's basically just a toxin yeah

3788.94 --> 3793.02
graphene oxide can technically even be

3791.819 --> 3796.579
sprayed

3793.02 --> 3796.579
and then it'll get on you

3797.28 --> 3803.4
but your body can get rid of that there

3800.7 --> 3805.74
is no nestling

3803.4 --> 3808.859
yeah there's nothing that's gonna get in

3805.74 --> 3811.4399999999996
you and then see itself in your flesh

3808.859 --> 3813.839
and now it's gonna produce that [ __ ]

3811.44 --> 3817.559
doesn't work like that yeah

3813.839 --> 3822.0589999999997
the only way that can be made to work is

3817.559 --> 3825.0
through direct subdermal injection

3822.059 --> 3828.1800000000003
something that's directly injected into

3825.0 --> 3831.299
your flesh with like extremely unnatural

3828.18 --> 3833.5789999999997
chemicals that are gonna literally on

3831.299 --> 3834.839
the spot through pure toxic influence

3833.579 --> 3837.8390000000004
alter

3834.839 --> 3839.819
like the physiology in that place

3837.839 --> 3844.14
yeah

3839.819 --> 3847.079
you have to have the toxic a load of

3844.14 --> 3849.18
really unnatural unstable chemicals that

3847.079 --> 3851.2200000000003
out in the open wouldn't even maintain

3849.18 --> 3854.94
their stability you have to have that

3851.22 --> 3857.4599999999996
directly injected in your flesh to be

3854.94 --> 3860.04
able to have a thing created there

3857.46 --> 3865.799
that's gonna start producing a natural

3860.04 --> 3867.119
proteins yeah there is no way in hell

3865.799 --> 3869.94
ever

3867.119 --> 3871.099
that if you could be buried under

3869.94 --> 3875.339
supposed

3871.099 --> 3878.04
literally being buried under it it's not

3875.339 --> 3880.44
going to seed in you

3878.04 --> 3884.48
it doesn't work that way

3880.44 --> 3884.48
it can't work that way

3887.76 --> 3892.28
it's horseshit shedding is horseshit

3893.64 --> 3897.72
it doesn't lack evidence it lacks the

3896.16 --> 3900.66
full-on logic

3897.72 --> 3902.7599999999998
no it doesn't work that way nothing in

3900.66 --> 3905.64
biology works that way

3902.76 --> 3908.46
yeah it only works that way and stupid

3905.64 --> 3911.0989999999997
ass science fiction movies

3908.46 --> 3914.839
oh there's this alien thing don't touch

3911.099 --> 3914.839
it oops I touch it oh

3915.859 --> 3922.46
yeah that's [ __ ] movies dude it

3919.02 --> 3922.46
doesn't happen in reality

3927.799 --> 3933.5
fish I don't I don't know what that is

3930.24 --> 3933.5
what about it

3939.559 --> 3945.48
with all the exercise you've been doing

3941.88 --> 3947.88
it you've been dead yeah

3945.48 --> 3950.059
because sporting people get the worst of

3947.88 --> 3950.059
it

3950.339 --> 3955.5589999999997
I mean it literally

3952.68 --> 3958.9199999999996
the shot what it does it plugs you up

3955.559 --> 3961.3190000000004
and so the more you need blood flow the

3958.92 --> 3962.52
more you're gonna like fall over at some

3961.319 --> 3964.5
point

3962.52 --> 3966.119
when you sport

3964.5 --> 3967.319
that's the whole [ __ ] problem with

3966.119 --> 3969.48
that [ __ ]

3967.319 --> 3972.799
that's why so many spoilers fall over

3969.48 --> 3972.799
even live

3982.98 --> 3990.359
yeah so don't be afraid of shedding

3988.619 --> 3992.6400000000003
all right dank

3990.359 --> 3996.839
serious

3992.64 --> 3999.18
listen to me trust my senses on this it

3996.839 --> 4001.52
doesn't exist

3999.18 --> 4004.0389999999998
right

4001.52 --> 4006.14
the only way there's any kind of

4004.039 --> 4008.2990000000004
similarities that's gonna happen to you

4006.14 --> 4010.5789999999997
is if you're literally continually

4008.299 --> 4013.88
surrounded

4010.579 --> 4016.099
by vaccinated people like for example if

4013.88 --> 4017.599
you were in the hospital you you're in

4016.099 --> 4019.819
an accident or something and you're

4017.599 --> 4022.039
continually being taken care of and

4019.819 --> 4023.96
cleaned up by nurses that are all very

4022.039 --> 4025.4
clearly vaccinated having showing

4023.96 --> 4028.52
symptoms and everything

4025.4 --> 4030.26
well then you might eventually like have

4028.52 --> 4032.5389999999998
a weird side effect

4030.26 --> 4034.7000000000003
but guess what I'm pretty confident that

4032.539 --> 4036.2000000000003
side effect can be made to go completely

4034.7 --> 4038.72
away

4036.2 --> 4040.2799999999997
as long as you don't hang around with

4038.72 --> 4042.98
that anymore then

4040.28 --> 4044.1800000000003
so nothing permanent nothing that's

4042.98 --> 4047.2400000000002
gonna

4044.18 --> 4049.7
Dr leak on you and

4047.24 --> 4053.9199999999996
and then grow inside of you

4049.7 --> 4053.9199999999996
don't worry it's not real

4054.02 --> 4059.42
yeah that's all science fiction it's

4057.079 --> 4060.579
just there to terrify you just there to

4059.42 --> 4065.2400000000002
basically

4060.579 --> 4067.099
create more mercilessness towards the

4065.24 --> 4069.859
vaccinated

4067.099 --> 4071.7200000000003
right it's there to create more fear

4069.859 --> 4074.18
from unvaccinated people towards

4071.72 --> 4078.52
vaccinated

4074.18 --> 4078.52
that's what it is it's there to divide

4078.92 --> 4081.88
it's not real

4082.88 --> 4088.2200000000003
just another

4084.799 --> 4093.16
another button in the social engineering

4088.22 --> 4093.16
play that's being Unleashed on us

4097.699 --> 4100.178999999999
right

4101.839 --> 4106.16
hmm

4103.46 --> 4108.44
[Music]

4106.16 --> 4110.48
what about this white protein yeah well

4108.44 --> 4113.599999999999
that's what they say

4110.48 --> 4116.62
right the spike protein is what they say

4113.6 --> 4116.620000000001
is the thing

4116.719 --> 4122.92
that is shedding

4118.819 --> 4122.92
right a spike protein is

4124.16 --> 4132.3189999999995
arguably it doesn't exist but

4127.759 --> 4134.719
I'm it is where I'm like not entirely

4132.319 --> 4136.9400000000005
certain but I think that Spike protein

4134.719 --> 4137.96
technically doesn't really exist but if

4136.94 --> 4140.3589999999995
it did

4137.96 --> 4142.759
then well that means there's an alien

4140.359 --> 4144.319
protein basically being somehow created

4142.759 --> 4148.279
in your body

4144.319 --> 4150.4400000000005
and that could only ever be achieved

4148.279 --> 4153.9800000000005
that a piece of your body is going to

4150.44 --> 4156.08
produce that buy a subdermal toxic

4153.98 --> 4158.239
injection

4156.08 --> 4160.4
you could have all that if that Spike

4158.239 --> 4163.16
protein really exists it's an unnatural

4160.4 --> 4165.259
protein it's going to have reactions

4163.16 --> 4168.0199999999995
well yeah that could get on you you

4165.259 --> 4170.779
might even eat it or whatever

4168.02 --> 4174.080000000001
it's just gonna be processed and kicked

4170.779 --> 4176.4800000000005
out like it's not oh despite creatine

4174.08 --> 4179.359
got to me and then it moves in because

4176.48 --> 4181.5199999999995
it owns me and it can just bike bypass

4179.359 --> 4184.400000000001
my immune system and just go and sit

4181.52 --> 4186.1990000000005
somewhere and then Nestle itself no the

4184.4 --> 4188.9
whole point of this bike routine is that

4186.199 --> 4192.379999999999
it's far into the body it's not gonna

4188.9 --> 4197.299999999999
get a chance to Nestle there

4192.38 --> 4203.6
unless it's accompanied by really toxic

4197.3 --> 4208.78
[ __ ] that'll like allow it to Nestle

4203.6 --> 4208.780000000001
which only happens with an injection

4209.239 --> 4211.9
see

4212.84 --> 4217.1
just

4214.82 --> 4218.96
it is logical

4217.1 --> 4220.52
just

4218.96 --> 4223.64
don't

4220.52 --> 4227.21
get caught up in this crazy

4223.64 --> 4228.38
Fair porn Rumor Mill about it

4227.21 --> 4232.3
[Music]

4228.38 --> 4232.3
it's shedding on me

stop talking about this [ __ ] yeah

4252.44 --> 4256.699
it's more likely that a demon from the

other dimension

4256.699 --> 4261.199
is gonna visit you in your nightmare

take you over and then

4261.199 --> 4269.32
like destroy the world that's more

4263.9 --> 4269.32
likely than freaking shedding okay

it's all a scam like the the as far as

4419.659 --> 4426.259999999999
I'm concerned like the mid-fast majority

4422.06 --> 4430.2390000000005
of like the medical industry is a scam

4426.26 --> 4430.2390000000005
Dr David Martin oh okay

this is not your cue the pile on the

4452.42 --> 4457.219
retards yeah

4454.46 --> 4459.679
just because I don't instantly ban Sean

4457.219 --> 4461.84
Hawkins once detected in my chat doesn't

4459.679 --> 4466.159
mean that it's a green light for a bunch

at all

4490.46 --> 4496.179
would you bet me I've said nothing

4492.38 --> 4496.179
offensive because you're useless

4497.96 --> 4501.8
but you're right you haven't said

4500.3 --> 4504.38
anything offensive and that's why I

4501.8 --> 4508.28
haven't banned you so but I'm sure

4504.38 --> 4511.04
you're gonna get there I'm sure you will

4508.28 --> 4513.0199999999995
people like you can't help themselves

4511.04 --> 4516.109
with that sort of thing

4513.02 --> 4516.109
[Music]

4520.159 --> 4525.98
all right

4521.84 --> 4529.34
cool yeah fine blue build evolution

4525.98 --> 4531.379999999999
like I don't need to like I get to

4529.34 --> 4533.96
through Infowars there are some

4531.38 --> 4536.84
different types of doctor types

4533.96 --> 4541.9
that do their stories a lot of them seem

4536.84 --> 4541.900000000001
to be highly part of a propaganda effort

4543.8 --> 4549.860000000001
and

4546.5 --> 4552.32
there has been so much [ __ ]

4549.86 --> 4555.139999999999
but it's like you can't really pinpoint

4552.32 --> 4556.46
it too much it's just that it's still

4555.14 --> 4559.52
Medical

4556.46 --> 4560.78
stuff and the medical stuff is just

4559.52 --> 4564.159000000001
[ __ ]

4560.78 --> 4564.159
it's just [ __ ]

4565.4 --> 4571.5199999999995
they're talking about things that that

4568.28 --> 4574.159
literally did it isn't there

4571.52 --> 4575.659000000001
that's a scam from within the medical

4574.159 --> 4578.659
industry

4575.659 --> 4582.879999999999
like they make up [ __ ] they made up

4578.659 --> 4582.879999999999
viruses it's not real

4584.719 --> 4590.26
it never was it's just a stupid concept

4593.6 --> 4598.219
right so they're all just going on those

4596.239 --> 4601.879999999999
premises they're all presupposing

4598.219 --> 4604.58
viruses are real all that [ __ ] so it's

4601.88 --> 4607.04
all [ __ ] pointless everything they

4604.58 --> 4610.159
have to say like as soon as a doctor to

4607.04 --> 4612.32
me says like oh oh you can do this with

4610.159 --> 4614.9
the virus or against it and this is how

4612.32 --> 4618.259999999999
you can prevent it or cure it I'm

4614.9 --> 4621.98
immediately like you're a hack

4618.26 --> 4624.1990000000005
you're a hack you actually think viruses

4621.98 --> 4627.639999999999
are real you have no evidence

4624.199 --> 4631.639999999999
but apparently you've never had that

4627.64 --> 4634.64
scientific Spirit like maybe I should

4631.64 --> 4636.92
actually confirm that that thing I keep

4634.64 --> 4639.62
blabbering about all day long is

4636.92 --> 4642.1990000000005
actually real

4639.62 --> 4646.699
yeah a lot of these doctors don't do

4642.199 --> 4649.299999999999
that because it's just it's astrophysics

4646.699 --> 4651.259999999999
except medical it's like medical

4649.3 --> 4652.9400000000005
astrophysics that's what a lot of

4651.26 --> 4657.14
medical

4652.94 --> 4658.879999999999
ideas have become it's just nonsense it

4657.14 --> 4660.7390000000005
reaches into territories that haven't

4658.88 --> 4662.42
been tested and where there's fraud

4660.739 --> 4664.879999999999
being put in place

4662.42 --> 4666.62
and stupid little tricks

4664.88 --> 4670.9400000000005
just like

4666.62 --> 4672.92
magical thinking tricks that people that

4670.94 --> 4675.5599999999995
have absolutely no idea about anything

4672.92 --> 4677.54
medical it's all magical to them so

4675.56 --> 4680.84
they're like oh yeah whatever you say

4677.54 --> 4683.8
doctor yeah yeah it's all harsh [ __ ]

4680.84 --> 4683.8
though what they made up

4684.08 --> 4689.0599999999995
yeah there is no viruses viruses don't

4688.04 --> 4693.199
exist

4689.06 --> 4695.179
it it's not a thing it's a made-up thing

4693.199 --> 4698.78
it doesn't exist

4695.179 --> 4701.9
there's no micro particle

4698.78 --> 4704.84
that's gonna come from the outside world

4701.9 --> 4706.879999999999
It's gotta get in you

4704.84 --> 4709.04
and then make you sick

4706.88 --> 4713.719
yeah unless

4709.04 --> 4716.42
it is acute toxic like direct poison

4713.719 --> 4718.28
if a poison particle gets on you and

4716.42 --> 4719.06
yeah you can have a heavy response to

4718.28 --> 4720.679
that

4719.06 --> 4723.320000000001
yeah

4720.679 --> 4725.84
it's not an entity

4723.32 --> 4728.42
that's gonna get in you

4725.84 --> 4731.32
and then start replicating you and

4728.42 --> 4731.32
taking you over

4734.12 --> 4738.679
doesn't exist

4735.739 --> 4742.82
like even bacteria don't do that

4738.679 --> 4745.1
it's all harshit the entire notion is a

4742.82 --> 4748.46
plant it's a planted idea

4745.1 --> 4751.159000000001
it the medical industry with viruses

4748.46 --> 4753.56
created a literal ghost it's a ghost

4751.159 --> 4756.5599999999995
it's gonna get you but I don't see it

4753.56 --> 4758.780000000001
doctor yeah but it is Gonna Get You Look

4756.56 --> 4759.8
At see this patient died he had the

4758.78 --> 4766.099999999999
ghost

4759.8 --> 4769.3
right it that is what it [ __ ] is guys

4766.1 --> 4769.3
it's a scam

4774.5 --> 4779.84
no you don't know what viruses look like

4777.199 --> 4784.46
and you don't know how they act

4779.84 --> 4787.4800000000005
and they've never actually been shown in

4784.46 --> 4787.4800000000005
action ever

4790.82 --> 4797.239
and every equipment

4794.239 --> 4801.199
out there every medical test equipment

4797.239 --> 4804.82
guess what none of them actually have

4801.199 --> 4804.82
anything to do with viruses

4806.0 --> 4812.239
yeah it's all based on theories

4809.14 --> 4814.64
associated with virus models

4812.239 --> 4817.04
there is no actual proof for viruses

4814.64 --> 4818.42
that they do anything

4817.04 --> 4820.82
yeah

4818.42 --> 4825.08
there's things in our bodies that our

4820.82 --> 4827.659
bodies start to excrete when we're in a

4825.08 --> 4830.239
yeah an inflamed situation right to get

4827.659 --> 4833.32
some inflammation somewhere it's burden

4830.239 --> 4835.58
your body gets to it and guess what

4833.32 --> 4839.32
exosomes is what they call it get

4835.58 --> 4842.12
ejected by cells the exosomes acutely

4839.32 --> 4845.48
clean up toxic

4842.12 --> 4848.0599999999995
stuff directly surrounding it

4845.48 --> 4852.08
they clean it up as an emergency Cleanup

4848.06 --> 4854.659000000001
Crew yeah that's what they claim viruses

4852.08 --> 4857.42
are it's those particles

4854.659 --> 4860.78
those particles are literally an

4857.42 --> 4862.28
integral part of the cellular bodily

4860.78 --> 4865.5199999999995
mechanisms

4862.28 --> 4866.96
it's not a foreign thing that's invading

4865.52 --> 4869.6
you

4866.96 --> 4872.78
and then coming out and making more no

4869.6 --> 4875.0
it's literally the vacuum cleaner it's

4872.78 --> 4877.639999999999
the vacuum cleaner that taken out of the

4875.0 --> 4880.76
closet to clean up the [ __ ] that's what

4877.64 --> 4884.84
these viruses are that doctors claim are

4880.76 --> 4887.8
invading particles it's all horseshit

4884.84 --> 4887.8
all of it

4896.8 --> 4904.1
yeah you want to get you want to know

4900.62 --> 4906.8
the reason the cause of disease look

4904.1 --> 4911.02
into terrain Theory

4906.8 --> 4911.02
that model actually makes sense

4912.34 --> 4917.4800000000005
to give you a very clear objective on

4915.739 --> 4919.82
what to do

4917.48 --> 4923.839999999999
to avoid getting sick

4919.82 --> 4926.96
and it works it works on everything

4923.84 --> 4933.400000000001
it is the superior model where the virus

4926.96 --> 4933.4
model only serves to create more fear

4934.58 --> 4939.26
and more paranoia medical paranoia it

4937.46 --> 4940.52
plays into that

4939.26 --> 4944.02
yeah

4940.52 --> 4944.02
and it doesn't even exist

4948.56 --> 4953.3
please

4951.159 --> 4954.86
what the [ __ ] you're gonna have a

4953.3 --> 4957.860000000001
pointer or do I need to kick you out

4954.86 --> 4957.86
Mateo

4957.92 --> 4965.0
it's called terrain theory yes it was

4961.1 --> 4970.46
out there all the time in 2020

4965.0 --> 4972.86
and got like it got squished by media

4970.46 --> 4976.1
like doctors that talked about it had

4972.86 --> 4980.62
issues they got kicked off all the media

4976.1 --> 4980.620000000001
and they ended up on bit shoot mostly

4981.58 --> 4987.26
how do I come up with this or actual

4984.38 --> 4989.4800000000005
doctors actual doctors that explain it

4987.26 --> 4991.280000000001
to me and I paid attention and I

4989.48 --> 4995.0199999999995
understood because I'm not a Fundy

4991.28 --> 4995.0199999999995
[ __ ] like Mateo here

4996.64 --> 5003.0
just take your shot take your booster

4999.679 --> 5003.0
material and [ __ ] off

5006.88 --> 5012.56
going out you're dead

5009.35 --> 5012.56
[Music]

5012.64 --> 5015.4800000000005
all right okay

5022.8 --> 5025.85
[Music]

5034.8 --> 5040.360000000001
the goal of German theory is pandemic

5037.84 --> 5045.9400000000005
and taking your rights away correct

5040.36 --> 5048.639999999999
it's full Eugenics control yeah viruses

5045.94 --> 5052.239
are a medical science fiction concept

5048.64 --> 5057.12
that was created by eugenicists

5052.239 --> 5057.12
as a form of medical mind control

5058.78 --> 5062.679
because

5060.4 --> 5063.94
a patient that's really afraid of

5062.679 --> 5066.9400000000005
viruses

5063.94 --> 5070.48
will be really dumb enough

5066.94 --> 5073.12
to undergo risky medical procedures that

5070.48 --> 5074.86
they know nothing about because the

5073.12 --> 5077.44
doctors say that it might help against

5074.86 --> 5080.98
these viruses which are science fiction

5077.44 --> 5083.739
Concepts that don't even exist yeah

5080.98 --> 5086.32
so it literally makes weak people

5083.739 --> 5091.48
malleable

5086.32 --> 5093.96
to legally do lethal experimentations on

5091.48 --> 5093.959999999999
yeah

5094.78 --> 5101.08
it's just a mechanism that's there to

5098.08 --> 5103.78
help Dr mangala continue this Spirit of

5101.08 --> 5107.08
his experimentation but in a legal

5103.78 --> 5109.42
setting yes it's a legal lie medical

5107.08 --> 5112.42
legal lie created

5109.42 --> 5115.2390000000005
to lure people in to getting themselves

5112.42 --> 5117.88
killed through experimentation

5115.239 --> 5121.86
isn't that just genius

5117.88 --> 5121.86
Dr Mengele would have been proud

5122.26 --> 5128.56
to see how the virus idea just developed

5126.219 --> 5131.679
out there and

5128.56 --> 5135.04
be in Wonder like wow

5131.679 --> 5138.64
I had to keep all my [ __ ] secret but

5135.04 --> 5141.699
they somehow managed 180 years later to

5138.64 --> 5143.92
just do it all out in the open and the

5141.699 --> 5146.678999999999
people they were all so conditioned that

5143.92 --> 5149.02
they were the ones that got it they

5146.679 --> 5152.02
hadn't nobody needed the force them no

5149.02 --> 5155.14
they they came

5152.02 --> 5158.1990000000005
begging for salvation

5155.14 --> 5161.1
of their mind control

5158.199 --> 5161.099999999999
delusions

5161.26 --> 5164.280000000001
that's amazing

5173.32 --> 5175.86
right

5176.139 --> 5180.46
what

5177.46 --> 5180.46
hmm

5183.699 --> 5186.879999999999
right and it's the same thing with the

5185.62 --> 5189.4
eights

5186.88 --> 5192.52
like oh

5189.4 --> 5194.5599999999995
you got HIV or something what the [ __ ]

5192.52 --> 5196.06
even is that I have no idea I don't

5194.56 --> 5200.02
think it's real

5196.06 --> 5201.88
it's a virus so it's pretty much not

5200.02 --> 5205.4800000000005
real then

5201.88 --> 5209.1
literally it's like oh your exosomes

5205.48 --> 5212.44
have a very specific type of

5209.1 --> 5214.3
signature isn't that fascinating so

5212.44 --> 5216.699
we're claiming now that that specific

5214.3 --> 5218.58
type of signature of your exosomes that

5216.699 --> 5221.98
come in when you get sick of something

5218.58 --> 5224.32
that that means you got HIV and that

5221.98 --> 5226.419999999999
means you're gonna get fa so quickly get

5224.32 --> 5230.08
on REM deserveer

5226.42 --> 5232.06
so that you actually do get AIDS and

5230.08 --> 5236.44
then die

5232.06 --> 5239.8
all because a fictional particle

5236.44 --> 5242.739
was found and then you were Thrive

5239.8 --> 5246.76
threatened like oh you got this thing if

5242.739 --> 5250.419999999999
you don't take my special Juicy Juice in

5246.76 --> 5252.280000000001
this syringe or these sets of pills that

5250.42 --> 5255.28
are expert if you don't take that it's

5252.28 --> 5258.099999999999
gonna kill you guess what that the

5255.28 --> 5260.139
solution is gonna kill you

5258.1 --> 5264.52
that's the tactic

5260.139 --> 5267.219
it's a Eugenics tactic Dr fauci was one

5264.52 --> 5271.620000000001
of the worst the first ones that really

5267.219 --> 5271.62
apply that publicly like that

5271.9 --> 5278.199
but it's become kind of standardized now

5276.34 --> 5283.42
like the whole

5278.199 --> 5285.5199999999995
2020 2021 situation was basically a

5283.42 --> 5290.1990000000005
continuation of that

5285.52 --> 5293.56
right all voluntary like no man with HIV

5290.199 --> 5296.32
was forced to take REM desevere

5293.56 --> 5299.5
they all chose it to do that and then

5296.32 --> 5304.12
continue doing it until they died

5299.5 --> 5305.08
yeah nobody was actually taken forced to

5304.12 --> 5308.679
take

5305.08 --> 5311.5
this medical experimentation

5308.679 --> 5314.7390000000005
yeah you might have lost your job you

5311.5 --> 5317.139
might have not been there

5314.739 --> 5319.36
for grandma or something and that is it

5317.139 --> 5320.9800000000005
is really heartbreaking I will give you

5319.36 --> 5323.92
that

5320.98 --> 5327.419999999999
but nobody actually forced you to take

5323.92 --> 5327.42
it and that's a fact

5334.36 --> 5343.86
what the [ __ ] empty [ __ ] Sean

5340.179 --> 5343.86
you're a [ __ ] freak

5360.1 --> 5367.179
yeah I don't give a [ __ ] for your blunt

5363.34 --> 5369.28
denial of reality John

5367.179 --> 5370.179
if you can't handle this then just [ __ ]

5369.28 --> 5374.8
off

5370.179 --> 5378.34
absolutely yeah then just [ __ ] off

5374.8 --> 5380.58
I don't want to hear you I'm a [ __ ]

5378.34 --> 5384.82
[ __ ] I'm gonna deny everything

5380.58 --> 5387.1
everything yeah well [ __ ] off then

5384.82 --> 5389.5599999999995
I don't give a [ __ ] that you're too

5387.1 --> 5392.08
[ __ ] to be able to understand or

5389.56 --> 5394.5
accept this

5392.08 --> 5397.48
yeah

5394.5 --> 5399.94
go hang with the other retards then like

5397.48 --> 5404.04
you that like you don't accept [ __ ]

5399.94 --> 5404.04
reality just go hang with them then okay

5417.54 --> 5423.94
puts on what is called a [ __ ] show

5421.54 --> 5425.679
yeah I don't care I don't watch his [ __ ]

5423.94 --> 5429.759999999999
it's garbage

5425.679 --> 5432.6990000000005
is supposed reviews of me are like they

5429.76 --> 5435.639
have no content the only content in his

5432.699 --> 5437.44
reviews of me is the things

5435.639 --> 5440.08
that I say

5437.44 --> 5442.719
which have meaning which have

5440.08 --> 5446.38
implications nothing he ever says or

5442.719 --> 5450.04
comments with have any implications or

5446.38 --> 5452.6990000000005
content or meaning it's he's just there

5450.04 --> 5456.4
wasting everybody's time

5452.699 --> 5458.62
like dude I'd rather watch Dell

5456.4 --> 5461.699
he's getting there Dell is getting to

5458.62 --> 5461.699
Sean Hawkins level

5462.639 --> 5467.56
it's getting that [ __ ] Lane

5465.1 --> 5470.5
do Norway viruses you have no proof for

5467.56 --> 5472.3
viruses viruses are a medical science

5470.5 --> 5477.3
fiction concept

5472.3 --> 5477.3
have not been proven

5477.76 --> 5480.900000000001
Harry Cornwall

5482.62 --> 5488.739
probably plenty of doctors that will

5485.86 --> 5490.179
explain exactly to you

5488.739 --> 5494.32
how

5490.179 --> 5497.1990000000005
a virus is detected or established or

5494.32 --> 5500.38
identified would you just listen to

5497.199 --> 5504.96
those procedures and then think

5500.38 --> 5504.96
is that really a virus

5505.3 --> 5512.26
or is it just a bunch of Flesh and then

5509.98 --> 5514.54
you unleash chemicals on the Flesh and

5512.26 --> 5516.58
then it disintegrates and then you put

5514.54 --> 5518.98
another chemical there and then

5516.58 --> 5521.38
eventually these weird globules which

5518.98 --> 5524.919999999999
are just parts of liquid start to

5521.38 --> 5527.38
coalesce and then it's like oh yeah that

5524.92 --> 5529.659
looks like it's a thing but it isn't a

5527.38 --> 5532.54
thing because it's just a globule of

5529.659 --> 5534.219
liquid that just forms a little little

5532.54 --> 5537.659
ball thing

5534.219 --> 5539.219
yeah that's where they got the idea the

5537.659 --> 5542.98
fictional

5539.219 --> 5546.699
inspiration for the virus CDI from yeah

5542.98 --> 5548.739
it's just a globule of cell juice

5546.699 --> 5552.48
that's sitting there

5548.739 --> 5554.799999999999
not being a unit not being an object

5552.48 --> 5557.199
definitely not being alive and

5554.8 --> 5559.719
definitely not being capable of doing

5557.199 --> 5564.638999999999
anything other than floating around and

5559.719 --> 5569.58
disintegrating yeah viruses don't exist

5564.639 --> 5569.58
it's science fiction or [ __ ]

5582.639 --> 5589.02
the norm yeah there's no reality in

5586.42 --> 5589.02
viruses

5590.139 --> 5595.08
that just go and ask a medical

5593.139 --> 5597.28
professional

5595.08 --> 5599.8
laboratory worker because that's what

5597.28 --> 5601.36
you need right you want to get proof of

5599.8 --> 5603.88
viruses well you're going to have to be

5601.36 --> 5605.739
a labyrinth then

5603.88 --> 5606.82
you have to be able to do laboratory

5605.739 --> 5610.48
work

5606.82 --> 5613.299999999999
because oh yeah just regular doctors or

5610.48 --> 5615.58
a microscope guess what

5613.3 --> 5618.58
nothing is going to yield that virus no

5615.58 --> 5620.98
you have to [ __ ] around

5618.58 --> 5624.82
it's like what is it monkey kidney cells

5620.98 --> 5627.879999999999
or bovine cells and at just a bunch of

5624.82 --> 5629.92
toxic garbage and you [ __ ] around with

5627.88 --> 5632.56
it and you mix it and you sift it in

5629.92 --> 5634.36
more garbage and then eventually you get

5632.56 --> 5638.8
the virus yeah

5634.36 --> 5643.42
it's [ __ ] horseshit it's literally a

5638.8 --> 5648.1
stupid ass cheap magician's trick

5643.42 --> 5652.42
there is no viruses they don't exist

5648.1 --> 5656.320000000001
no viruses like none at all

5652.42 --> 5659.5
the unit the conception of a virus doing

5656.32 --> 5663.4
something like what is talked about does

5659.5 --> 5666.219
not exist in any form there are no

5663.4 --> 5669.879999999999
viruses whatsoever

5666.219 --> 5672.52
yeah name any type of virus I can tell

5669.88 --> 5675.88
you it doesn't exist

5672.52 --> 5678.580000000001
and then you can have a very interesting

5675.88 --> 5681.58
piece of background research as to what

5678.58 --> 5683.5
is actually going on

5681.58 --> 5686.44
where

5683.5 --> 5687.88
what they call viruses are supposedly

5686.44 --> 5690.219
the cause

5687.88 --> 5692.26
there are many different types of

5690.219 --> 5693.82
conditions that are associated with

5692.26 --> 5696.6990000000005
viruses

5693.82 --> 5698.92
virus of this virus of that oh you get

5696.699 --> 5699.638999999999
this you get that yeah you do get those

5698.92 --> 5701.9800000000005
things

5699.639 --> 5704.5
but a virus has absolutely no

5701.98 --> 5707.08
involvement whatsoever

5704.5 --> 5710.44
and there are a lot of terrain theorists

5707.08 --> 5712.659
doctors that have done extensive

5710.44 --> 5714.58
research as to like what is actually

5712.659 --> 5717.159
causing this instead of this supposed

5714.58 --> 5719.76
virus and they find out there's a lot of

5717.159 --> 5723.4
the time there's just acute toxic

5719.76 --> 5726.6990000000005
influences that causes side effects that

5723.4 --> 5730.179
then lead to those disease symptoms if

5726.699 --> 5732.599999999999
you don't resolve the cause

5730.179 --> 5736.3
that's doing that the toxic influence

5732.6 --> 5741.179
then like you get really really sick

5736.3 --> 5746.04
right but it's not by recess because

5741.179 --> 5746.04
viruses don't exist

5746.32 --> 5751.98
diseases exist viruses don't exist

5755.98 --> 5758.638999999999
all right

5774.94 --> 5779.199
go [ __ ] yourself Johnny yeah

5779.92 --> 5786.78
go watch space Busters channel on bit

5784.12 --> 5789.639
Jude they have really elaborate

5786.78 --> 5794.099999999999
documentary this guy is a medical doctor

5789.639 --> 5794.1
he knows a lot of medical doctors

5795.1 --> 5802.3
has great sourcing

5797.739 --> 5805.36
and he's been doing it for a long time

5802.3 --> 5806.9800000000005
just check out spacebusters channel on

5805.36 --> 5811.48
bit shoot

5806.98 --> 5816.28
they have like complete documentaries

5811.48 --> 5819.159
about how viruses don't exist

5816.28 --> 5823.36
and exactly why

5819.159 --> 5825.638999999999
so if that's what you need

5823.36 --> 5828.04
in a flatter

5825.639 --> 5830.62
on YouTube doesn't do it for you

5828.04 --> 5832.96
evidence wise then just go check out the

5830.62 --> 5835.239
actual medical professional that's made

5832.96 --> 5838.02
it their lives work to expose medical

5835.239 --> 5838.0199999999995
fraud

5838.78 --> 5844.0599999999995
virology has ever been around for many

5841.3 --> 5846.1
years yes so has astrophysics yeah

5844.06 --> 5849.400000000001
equally horseshit

5846.1 --> 5853.02
completely conceptual garbage never been

5849.4 --> 5853.0199999999995
useful for anything ever

5855.88 --> 5863.1990000000005
virology exists it's [ __ ] it doesn't

5860.86 --> 5865.42
do anything it's just a bunch of

5863.199 --> 5866.5
statistic nonsense

5865.42 --> 5868.26
yeah

5866.5 --> 5874.12
it's basically

5868.26 --> 5876.52
statistics that surround a concept

5874.12 --> 5878.5599999999995
a concept that you think is the cause of

5876.52 --> 5881.080000000001
a disease it's basically like how does

5878.56 --> 5883.659000000001
this disease spread and then you just

5881.08 --> 5886.12
presuppose it's the virus doing it and

5883.659 --> 5888.879999999999
then you try to manipulate the situation

5886.12 --> 5890.86
based on the presupposition of the virus

5888.88 --> 5893.679
working that way

5890.86 --> 5897.04
and then going about that yeah that's

5893.679 --> 5899.9800000000005
one of what a virologist does

5897.04 --> 5901.78
they just [ __ ] presuppose viruses and

5899.98 --> 5903.58
then work with Statistics and that [ __ ]

5901.78 --> 5907.42
with that presupposition that's what

5903.58 --> 5911.46
they do it's a complete waste of time

5907.42 --> 5911.46
viruses don't exist

5912.219 --> 5918.9
it's a wasted profession if you've

5915.76 --> 5918.900000000001
chosen virology

5920.32 --> 5925.9
you're [ __ ] useless

5923.199 --> 5929.199
nobody needs virology it's not actually

5925.9 --> 5931.599999999999
a medical study it's Science Fiction

5929.199 --> 5932.86
it's horseshit there's no use you can

5931.6 --> 5935.320000000001
get out of it

5932.86 --> 5938.0199999999995
except that you can have this virtual

5935.32 --> 5939.4
Authority and create a lot of fair porn

5938.02 --> 5942.34
in people

5939.4 --> 5943.719
because you're a virologist

5942.34 --> 5946.3
yeah that's what you can do with it

5943.719 --> 5948.84
manipulate dumb people to get themselves

5946.3 --> 5948.84
killed

5948.88 --> 5952.5
that's what you can do with virology

5959.739 --> 5962.339999999999
foreign

5969.82 --> 5972.48
foreign

5984.239 --> 5991.08
do we run research yeah or just be good

5987.699 --> 5991.08
at finding good sources

5992.86 --> 5998.739
you have to have talent

5995.56 --> 6002.360000000001
to understand things and then figure out

5998.739 --> 6002.36
who's a good source

6003.48 --> 6008.218999999999
it's pretty much comes down to you have

6005.82 --> 6010.92
to be really [ __ ] smart

6008.219 --> 6012.96
and you have to be able to recognize

6010.92 --> 6013.679
other people that are really [ __ ]

6012.96 --> 6016.62
smart

6013.679 --> 6019.32
and then you can figure it out if you're

6016.62 --> 6021.239
not really freaking smart then you might

6019.32 --> 6023.34
think somebody is really freaking smart

6021.239 --> 6026.339999999999
but how would you know because you're

6023.34 --> 6029.12
not it just sounds really smart that's

6026.34 --> 6029.12
problematic

6037.38 --> 6043.400000000001
who is the medical professional who's a

6039.3 --> 6043.400000000001
good source space Busters on bit shoot

6046.44 --> 6051.138999999999
that's a good source a great source

6051.179 --> 6056.4
as the most elaborate data about viruses

6054.78 --> 6058.44
being fake

6056.4 --> 6059.879999999999
that I've ever seen

6058.44 --> 6062.82
because there's a lot of terrain

6059.88 --> 6064.62
theorists out there that explain like uh

6062.82 --> 6066.299999999999
the terrain theory is much more viable

6064.62 --> 6068.04
than

6066.3 --> 6071.1
than germ Theory

6068.04 --> 6072.3
here's why and it is

6071.1 --> 6075.0
but

6072.3 --> 6077.88
space there's not a lot of like doctors

6075.0 --> 6081.179
that really spend like time and energy

6077.88 --> 6083.84
on explaining that viruses themselves

6081.179 --> 6083.84
are fake

6084.48 --> 6089.58
I mean there's terrain theorists will

6086.4 --> 6091.62
say like yeah viruses are nonsense

6089.58 --> 6094.5599999999995
and then they will tell you like this is

6091.62 --> 6096.78
how they establish a virus

6094.56 --> 6098.639
they take a bunch of cells they put a

6096.78 --> 6101.28
bunch of chemicals on them refine them

6098.639 --> 6103.26
mix them do it again and then eventually

6101.28 --> 6105.239
they got a little globules that they

6103.26 --> 6107.46
will consider viruses

6105.239 --> 6110.459999999999
but they aren't it's just a horseshit

6107.46 --> 6113.119
parlor trick like most terrain theorists

6110.46 --> 6113.119
know about that

6114.06 --> 6117.84
right

6115.38 --> 6120.679
but the guy from space Busters he's done

6117.84 --> 6122.46
like really elaborate

6120.679 --> 6125.34
documentaries

6122.46 --> 6128.1
videos on why

6125.34 --> 6131.159000000001
viruses are fake

6128.1 --> 6133.1990000000005
so that's as far as I'm concerned the

6131.159 --> 6135.36
the better type of source if you wish to

6133.199 --> 6136.379999999999
inform yourself in more detail about

6135.36 --> 6138.48
this

6136.38 --> 6142.88
right but I'm gonna start building a

6138.48 --> 6142.879999999999
title because it's man time has run out

6147.0 --> 6153.96
and YouTube saying 102 minutes streaming

6151.619 --> 6157.82
yeah that's

6153.96 --> 6157.82
wait yeah that is correct

6177.24 --> 6183.63

6192.19 --> 6196.259999999999
[Music]

6192.43 --> 6198.54
[Applause]

6196.26 --> 6202.639
okay I'll keep it simple the Maui

6198.54 --> 6202.639
Firestorm and virus is fake

6203.88 --> 6210.659000000001
right

6205.619 --> 6212.699
so yeah I'm gonna ask one more time

6210.659 --> 6215.78
can I click please get some support

6212.699 --> 6215.78
through the PayPal

6217.32 --> 6223.259999999999

6221.46 --> 6226.1
if I'm not seeing that today I'm not

6223.26 --> 6226.1
