73.84 --> 77.52000000000001
button

74.88 --> 80.24
they'll be much appreciated and i can

77.52 --> 84.15899999999999
still use it

80.24 --> 88.0
seems like i've survived

84.159 --> 91.759
like the little dip moment of the month

88.0 --> 94.96
so i'm yeah back up the stock but

91.759 --> 98.159
yeah i still need some support

94.96 --> 99.119
so please do keep coming because

98.159 --> 102.56
otherwise yeah

99.119 --> 105.04
the debts are going to keep on nibbling

102.56 --> 105.04
at me

106.0 --> 109.52
bills bills bills and my rent just got

108.72 --> 112.64
up

109.52 --> 113.6
also not too much by the way but yeah

112.64 --> 116.719
still a little

113.6 --> 117.91999999999999
it's surprising that yeah the landlord

116.719 --> 120.64
hasn't done it before

117.92 --> 122.88
i think it was because we had like this

120.64 --> 126.0
really strong verbal agreement

122.88 --> 127.759
at first that he wouldn't do that

126.0 --> 129.84
but yeah he probably regrets that

127.759 --> 132.64
happened but he's been honorable

129.84 --> 133.92000000000002
and now after seven years he up the the

132.64 --> 135.92
rent a little

133.92 --> 137.67999999999998
so and i can survive that because i am

135.92 --> 141.28
doing much better now

137.68 --> 144.72
also on average than i was say

141.28 --> 148.16
four years ago so

144.72 --> 151.2
right but yeah it's also thanks to well

148.16 --> 154.72
the continuing support of all you guys

151.2 --> 157.44
that i am at this point but if it stops

154.72 --> 158.959
then i'm gonna get into trouble just say

157.44 --> 160.64
not saying that it will stop

158.959 --> 162.0
not saying that you're planning to stop

160.64 --> 164.07999999999998
it but

162.0 --> 165.68
i've gave some forecasts that i might be

164.08 --> 167.59900000000002
doing a lot better

165.68 --> 169.44
somewhere in the near future but that

167.599 --> 173.83999999999997
hasn't happened yet

169.44 --> 175.44
and yeah i try not to put all my hopes

173.84 --> 177.04
on it it's just that i've been looking

175.44 --> 179.2
forward to something like that for a

177.04 --> 182.4
very long time

179.2 --> 185.04
but yeah as we all know hope

182.4 --> 186.8
in in the current age can be very

185.04 --> 189.67999999999998
deceiving

186.8 --> 190.87900000000002
so i'm just going to need the support to

189.68 --> 193.76000000000002
keep on going

190.879 --> 195.76
so yeah that was my little my little

193.76 --> 199.67999999999998
intro

195.76 --> 203.12
on right

199.68 --> 206.48000000000002
uh the weather today is

203.12 --> 206.48000000000002
quite beautiful

207.2 --> 212.159
yeah maybe like some trails a little

210.56 --> 215.28
here and there but

212.159 --> 218.319
there's still plenty of sun

215.28 --> 219.92
and blue sky with a bit of a haze here

218.319 --> 223.04
and there

219.92 --> 225.28
but yeah that sun is beautiful

223.04 --> 227.84
and as you can see it's it's going right

225.28 --> 227.84
in my room

229.36 --> 233.20000000000002
so now you can see when it's out of

231.36 --> 234.72000000000003
sight how bright it actually is just

233.2 --> 240.319
this spot

234.72 --> 242.239
reflecting all over the place right

240.319 --> 243.67999999999998
and it's actually kind of nice and warm

242.239 --> 248.239
even

243.68 --> 248.239
so pleasant morning

251.599 --> 257.03999999999996
right and at the in the meantime in

253.68 --> 259.759
england it apparently is still freezing

257.04 --> 260.639
and snowing and all that or at least it

259.759 --> 263.36
snowed

260.639 --> 265.04
yesterday i think here we go again

263.36 --> 268.40000000000003
mentioned that

265.04 --> 269.68
so yeah i guess we're in a bit of a

268.4 --> 274.32
sunny spot here

269.68 --> 274.32
in the netherlands although

274.8 --> 281.28000000000003
yeah societally

278.0 --> 285.199
not so much because we

281.28 --> 287.28
are lit we are like now in a curfew

285.199 --> 290.639
situation

287.28 --> 292.71999999999997
it's like we've been tricked like on

290.639 --> 294.08
that's very much what i think a lot of

292.72 --> 296.88000000000005
people feel like

294.08 --> 299.28
like the cabinet stepped down but

296.88 --> 302.639
despite it stepping down

299.28 --> 303.75899999999996
the cove it will now curfew it's still

302.639 --> 305.84000000000003
just happening

303.759 --> 307.759
so these things were pre-planned then

305.84 --> 311.59999999999997
they step away

307.759 --> 315.52000000000004
but it's still unrolling

311.6 --> 315.84000000000003
and yeah very bizarre so now you cannot

315.52 --> 320.08
lit

315.84 --> 320.08
you could literally cannot be outside

320.24 --> 324.72
after a certain time was it after eight

322.16 --> 327.36
o'clock i think

324.72 --> 327.759
so you can't even like go home anywhere

327.36 --> 331.52000000000004
it's

327.759 --> 334.56
totally insane and

331.52 --> 337.039
yeah my friend

334.56 --> 338.72
that i had that long call with uh two

337.039 --> 340.32
days ago

338.72 --> 342.639
also mentioned like yeah that's gonna

340.32 --> 343.52
completely wreck the way she has to go

342.639 --> 345.68
around

343.52 --> 347.039
because she can't just visit friends now

345.68 --> 350.88
unless she can stay over

347.039 --> 352.88
like that this

350.88 --> 355.759
everything's just become a huge hassle

352.88 --> 355.759
now because of this

357.919 --> 361.19899999999996
right but at least the weather is nice

359.919 --> 363.59999999999997
hooray

361.199 --> 363.6
also

364.319 --> 373.12
a little personal situation that's good

368.72 --> 375.12
uh yesterday i went into the store and i

373.12 --> 377.44
saw something and it reminded me of a

375.12 --> 380.56
situation way back

377.44 --> 384.08
uh now nine years ago

380.56 --> 387.52
because i saw this standing on this

384.08 --> 388.639
on the shelf i think it was there before

387.52 --> 392.639
but it i

388.639 --> 394.40000000000003
i just noticed it like magnesium citrate

392.639 --> 395.919
it's basically magnesium and i

394.4 --> 398.23999999999995
remembered

395.919 --> 400.0
that way back when i was still with my

398.24 --> 404.24
girlfriend my ex

400.0 --> 407.36
uh like after 2012

404.24 --> 407.96000000000004
like that like pretty much the starting

407.36 --> 412.0
of

407.96 --> 414.63899999999995
2013. we were all like really flustered

412.0 --> 416.479
i was because i literally thought that

414.639 --> 419.36
the world was gonna end

416.479 --> 420.56
like it i i really thought that it's

419.36 --> 423.36
almost like i built

420.56 --> 424.0
towards that in a way very bad choice to

423.36 --> 426.72
do

424.0 --> 427.759
but yeah hey i didn't see much for my

426.72 --> 430.08000000000004
future so

427.759 --> 431.759
i kind of latched on to that by accident

430.08 --> 436.24
but after that there was like this

431.759 --> 439.759
moment of flustered and like exhaustion

436.24 --> 441.199
and what my ex looked up like she was

439.759 --> 443.28000000000003
very efficient at that

441.199 --> 445.199
at doing that that like alternative

443.28 --> 446.08
medical research like i got her into

445.199 --> 449.12
that but she's

446.08 --> 452.15999999999997
more proficient at it than i am

449.12 --> 452.88
better searcher for effective dentist

452.16 --> 456.88000000000005
you know she's

452.88 --> 459.919
she's got skills in general

456.88 --> 461.52
but she figured out like hey magnesium

459.919 --> 463.039
and she got it in another form like in

461.52 --> 465.44
some kind of a spray

463.039 --> 466.71999999999997
and it's also i looked it up again and

465.44 --> 471.759
it seems like it's very

466.72 --> 474.96000000000004
like ex stress exhaust exhaustion

471.759 --> 476.639
is also sometimes magnesium exhaustion

474.96 --> 479.84
because you apparently burn it up

476.639 --> 483.12
in your body when you stress out a lot

479.84 --> 486.87899999999996
well guess what i tried this stuff out

483.12 --> 487.759
and it blew me away and did not expect

486.879 --> 489.44
this

487.759 --> 491.12
because i've been like a bit of

489.44 --> 493.68
teachering in this sort of

491.12 --> 495.12
having a cold situation being very very

493.68 --> 497.84000000000003
snotly

495.12 --> 499.12
not anything serious not any a real

497.84 --> 502.31899999999996
inflammation but just

499.12 --> 503.28000000000003
annoying and like feel weak weak i took

502.319 --> 504.879
this stuff

503.28 --> 508.31899999999996
and yeah it was kind of disgusting

504.879 --> 510.47900000000004
really well not disgusting it's just not

508.319 --> 511.91900000000004
it's not like a nice flavor i think i

510.479 --> 515.1999999999999
don't know

511.919 --> 518.7189999999999
a bit like uh

515.2 --> 519.279
like baking soda kind of like that it's

518.719 --> 522.479
just like

519.279 --> 524.88
weird stuff anyway the taste of it but i

522.479 --> 527.76
took it and it's just like

524.88 --> 529.2
after that happened like it's like the

527.76 --> 533.8389999999999
all the symptoms just

529.2 --> 538.399
retracted like really quickly it's crazy

533.839 --> 541.44
it's not sulfate it's epsom salts

538.399 --> 541.44
this is citrate

541.76 --> 547.12
but i don't know magnesium and it does

545.12 --> 550.16
some it did something to me

547.12 --> 552.64
it also i also read up on it

550.16 --> 554.959
a little and if through natural news

552.64 --> 558.399
just superficial searches really

554.959 --> 561.4399999999999
and it also apparently helps

558.399 --> 564.64
sleeping so i took some of that

561.44 --> 566.8000000000001
or rather a large large dose

564.64 --> 568.959
like i was almost like oh is this too

566.8 --> 571.519
much who cares i'm just gonna do it

568.959 --> 573.8389999999999
i had a really good night's sleep and i

571.519 --> 575.6
feel so much better and more focused and

573.839 --> 577.36
there was kind of like this slow

575.6 --> 580.24
headache building up in the back of my

577.36 --> 582.72
head associated with just this cold

580.24 --> 582.72
symptoms

584.16 --> 588.0
not anything serious that would

585.68 --> 589.92
completely disrupt my concentration

588.0 --> 591.36
or like a real pain or something but

589.92 --> 594.3199999999999
just like ah

591.36 --> 596.72
and it's like almost entirely gone so i

594.32 --> 601.0400000000001
feel so much better what was that

596.72 --> 605.839
oh it's fire truck whatever

601.04 --> 605.8389999999999
huh no it's fire truck

607.6 --> 610.88
anyway yeah i tried that it felt better

610.56 --> 615.1199999999999
and

610.88 --> 617.36
i kind of like to recommend it

615.12 --> 619.36
because it's really healthy and long

617.36 --> 622.5600000000001
stress

619.36 --> 625.839
situations you burn magnesium up

622.56 --> 628.3199999999999
apparently and hey

625.839 --> 630.0
this stuff this is organic it's really

628.32 --> 633.7600000000001
cheap like this thing

630.0 --> 635.839
10 euros and yeah there's

633.76 --> 637.6
a whole bunch of it and you just need a

635.839 --> 640.24
very little amount really like a

637.6 --> 640.24
teaspoon

640.959 --> 644.8
each time you use it and i'm not even

642.88 --> 646.16
saying like oh i'm going to use this all

644.8 --> 648.8
the time but just

646.16 --> 650.8
that one time and i took like an entire

648.8 --> 653.8389999999999
scoop of it which is like

650.8 --> 655.8389999999999
four teaspoons i guess

653.839 --> 657.36
and i even like brushed my teeth with it

655.839 --> 659.6
a little because i had too much i just

657.36 --> 661.6
didn't want to swallow and i didn't

659.6 --> 662.88
was going to bed brushed my teeth

661.6 --> 665.839
basically with it

662.88 --> 666.48
dissolved in water and i feel really

665.839 --> 669.36
renewed

666.48 --> 670.88
just from that one time and it's lasted

669.36 --> 673.04
so

670.88 --> 674.88
yeah other people stressing out being

673.04 --> 678.16
disappointed over

674.88 --> 681.8389999999999
q for example or just

678.16 --> 681.8389999999999
lock down [ __ ]

682.8 --> 688.0
you know there's a lot of stress going

684.16 --> 689.36
around so maybe try out some magnesium

688.0 --> 692.64
there's a lot of people that are

689.36 --> 695.92
probably stocked up on things like zinc

692.64 --> 698.3199999999999
and vitamin c because of

695.92 --> 699.8389999999999
the yeah the solution it can pose for

698.32 --> 701.9200000000001
covet and all that

699.839 --> 705.9200000000001
right and it's good to have anyway but

701.92 --> 705.92
how many people will have magnesium

706.72 --> 713.12
when everybody is yeah

709.839 --> 716.0790000000001
under more stress on average so just a

713.12 --> 718.88
little medical tip for the day

716.079 --> 723.1999999999999
from a layman i tried it myself

718.88 --> 723.2
yesterday it was great i feel renewed

723.68 --> 728.1289999999999
[Music]

728.839 --> 735.0400000000001
oh

731.519 --> 735.04
all right all right

739.12 --> 744.0
it's a laxative yeah it also says that

741.6 --> 747.36
it's a laxative but

744.0 --> 747.36
i haven't noticed any of that

749.04 --> 754.88
but i think that yeah it can probably be

751.2 --> 754.88
a laxative if you take it in great

756.839 --> 759.839
quantities

763.44 --> 768.5600000000001
it's the i don't know

769.36 --> 773.839
it's magnesium i don't know there may be

772.8 --> 776.0
better forms it's

773.839 --> 777.6
it wasn't said to be like oh this is the

776.0 --> 782.399
best form or whatever

777.6 --> 786.9590000000001
this is just easy and cheap

782.399 --> 789.36
and it's still magnesium

786.959 --> 791.5189999999999
so of course i'm sure there's like more

789.36 --> 794.32
specialized better varieties of it

791.519 --> 794.32
out there even

796.0 --> 803.68
main use

801.36 --> 803.6800000000001
is it

808.399 --> 810.72
is that

813.6 --> 817.279
i don't know i've have i have seen that

816.88 --> 819.12
though

817.279 --> 821.8389999999999
in my searches that it is also

819.12 --> 823.68
apparently used for that

821.839 --> 825.9200000000001
maybe if you take it in really large

823.68 --> 828.6389999999999
quantities that would happen

825.92 --> 830.88
i haven't noticed anything unusual

828.639 --> 835.12
concerning that by the way

830.88 --> 839.36
so what i did notice is that just

835.12 --> 841.279
my yeah the cold symptoms and headache

839.36 --> 843.76
in the back of my head it all just went

841.279 --> 846.959
away like really quickly

843.76 --> 849.199
that's what i noticed from it and i

846.959 --> 850.6389999999999
wasn't expecting i wasn't anticipating

849.199 --> 852.8
that you see

850.639 --> 854.24
it wasn't like oh oh this is going to

852.8 --> 856.639
help my cold

854.24 --> 857.279
and then it went away or something no no

856.639 --> 859.199
it just

857.279 --> 860.72
it just had just went away i didn't even

859.199 --> 871.8389999999999
expect that

860.72 --> 871.839
so right

883.44 --> 889.7600000000001
yeah right many system and body muscle

885.92 --> 889.76
nerves well i feel much smoother

894.48 --> 898.32
right so i think that what might have

896.48 --> 902.48
been the case is that i've had some

898.32 --> 905.519
extreme lack of it

902.48 --> 907.519
right because i have checked my the

905.519 --> 911.199
other supplements i'm taking and there's

907.519 --> 914.399
there is no magnesium in any of it

911.199 --> 915.8389999999999
so i might have just run out and then my

914.399 --> 920.399
body just starts to like

915.839 --> 920.399
fall yeah stumble

920.56 --> 922.8
right

924.16 --> 928.639
but i yeah the funny thing was i didn't

926.56 --> 931.3599999999999
look it up

928.639 --> 932.8
i saw it in the store and i was like i

931.36 --> 934.88
have to get this

932.8 --> 937.92
and then when i get home i'm gonna look

934.88 --> 940.079
up why i need this

937.92 --> 942.4799999999999
because it's just like my intuition just

940.079 --> 946.3199999999999
like ah you have to get that

942.48 --> 948.8000000000001
like i didn't even understand why

946.32 --> 949.36
it's just magnesium and association back

948.8 --> 952.8389999999999
with the

949.36 --> 957.36
post 2012 sort of dip

952.839 --> 960.8800000000001
depression of yeah of nothing

957.36 --> 963.92
avoid and then back then it worked great

960.88 --> 966.0
it also really revitalized me

963.92 --> 967.4399999999999
so that's like the thought association

966.0 --> 970.32
that popped up with it

967.44 --> 971.2790000000001
and it's just like i'm yeah i'm going to

970.32 --> 973.36
get this

971.279 --> 975.36
and it wasn't super if it was really

973.36 --> 977.6800000000001
expensive i probably wouldn't have taken

975.36 --> 981.279
it but it was just like 10 bucks

977.68 --> 982.6389999999999
like okay i can do this

981.279 --> 984.32
i'm going to do this and then i'm going

982.639 --> 987.279
to look up what it does

984.32 --> 988.5600000000001
and it did but i also just took it and

987.279 --> 991.759
it was great

988.56 --> 994.079
right so anyway got a long ramble

991.759 --> 994.9590000000001
at the start just see how much energy i

994.079 --> 998.8
got i stop

994.959 --> 1001.7589999999999
can't stop talking right anyway i got

998.8 --> 1003.279
some extra tumerica not tamara coffee

1001.759 --> 1011.1990000000001
old habits

1003.279 --> 1014.32
no just regular coffee

1011.199 --> 1014.8
yeah by the way which also apparently i

1014.32 --> 1018.0790000000001
guess

1014.8 --> 1024.0
can drain magnesium a little

1018.079 --> 1025.6
but anyway i added like a quadruple dose

1024.0 --> 1027.76
and i'm not gonna make a habit of that

1025.6 --> 1031.76
so i don't know it's just like

1027.76 --> 1035.28
i really feel like i was in a great

1031.76 --> 1039.36
short of it and taking it has really

1035.28 --> 1053.84
resolved a lot of issues right now

1039.36 --> 1053.84
right so

1059.52 --> 1065.76
all right but anyway

1063.2 --> 1067.3600000000001
yeah what what you can get get out of it

1065.76 --> 1069.84
you're having a cold

1067.36 --> 1071.84
you got the zinc you got the vitamin c

1069.84 --> 1073.84
you got the colloidal silver

1071.84 --> 1074.9599999999998
and you're pretty much stocked up on

1073.84 --> 1077.36
everything you need

1074.96 --> 1079.1200000000001
well have you checked for magnesium

1077.36 --> 1081.12
because hey i did that

1079.12 --> 1085.4399999999998
and i'm really supplemented up in all

1081.12 --> 1090.32
kinds of ways i got the d3 and the k2

1085.44 --> 1090.3200000000002
vitamin c like

1090.64 --> 1095.44
was it b12 i got i got pretty much all

1093.919 --> 1098.24
the basics

1095.44 --> 1099.28
but there's no magnesium in it i took it

1098.24 --> 1102.559
and it's like

1099.28 --> 1104.48
bang so who knows

1102.559 --> 1106.799
you got this cold you can't understand

1104.48 --> 1110.08
where it's coming from

1106.799 --> 1112.48
try it out it might just completely take

1110.08 --> 1112.48
it away

1120.84 --> 1123.84
anyway

1129.64 --> 1133.1190000000001
[Music]

1150.72 --> 1155.3600000000001
right okay so is that gonna be the final

1153.919 --> 1156.24
thing that's i'm gonna have to stare

1155.36 --> 1158.3999999999999
right in chat

1156.24 --> 1160.16
main use power movements that's really

1158.4 --> 1163.2800000000002
cute

1160.16 --> 1167.44
i guess that's that's it for the uh

1163.28 --> 1167.44
the input from you guys

1171.2 --> 1179.3600000000001
right anyway yeah i had a funny title

1176.72 --> 1181.039
cavendish proves a lowering the bar plot

1179.36 --> 1184.32
twist

1181.039 --> 1188.16
right because there is this

1184.32 --> 1191.4399999999998
aberrant belief going on it's like very

1188.16 --> 1194.0800000000002
it's like a magician's trick that's gone

1191.44 --> 1195.52
way out of hand and has become like a

1194.08 --> 1198.96
belief cornerstone

1195.52 --> 1202.0
in a in a religion

1198.96 --> 1202.799
it's pretty bizarre and that is that the

1202.0 --> 1205.84
idea of

1202.799 --> 1207.76
cavendish gravity that cavendish

1205.84 --> 1210.8799999999999
experiment proves gravity

1207.76 --> 1212.1589999999999
right it doesn't actually do that if you

1210.88 --> 1215.3600000000001
read

1212.159 --> 1216.159
the hypothesis the theory the the

1215.36 --> 1218.7199999999998
formula

1216.159 --> 1219.3600000000001
that is involved you'll notice that

1218.72 --> 1223.76
gravity

1219.36 --> 1226.0
is not the subject it's just assumed

1223.76 --> 1227.919
in it and it involve yeah the entire

1226.0 --> 1229.44
hypothesis

1227.919 --> 1231.039
yeah it's not even a legitimate

1229.44 --> 1233.919
hypothesis but even

1231.039 --> 1235.28
the suggestion of it is not actually

1233.919 --> 1237.8400000000001
engaging

1235.28 --> 1239.76
in varying and manipulating gravity in

1237.84 --> 1242.9599999999998
order to prove it

1239.76 --> 1245.919
oh right so cavendish

1242.96 --> 1248.48
what it actually proves is a lowering

1245.919 --> 1251.679
the bar plot twist

1248.48 --> 1252.88
because that's what what happens when

1251.679 --> 1254.64
you find out

1252.88 --> 1256.159
when you actually start to look into it

1254.64 --> 1258.72
and listen

1256.159 --> 1259.6000000000001
it's like oh cavendish gravity and then

1258.72 --> 1262.88
we point out

1259.6 --> 1266.08
look this is what it is yeah it's not

1262.88 --> 1269.1200000000001
a torsion bar twist that proves

1266.08 --> 1272.32
the gravity no it's a

1269.12 --> 1275.039
lowering the bar plot twist

1272.32 --> 1276.0
because it actually forces the person to

1275.039 --> 1281.12
lower

1276.0 --> 1281.12
the bar intellectually mechanically

1281.6 --> 1285.36
and just kind of forget about it it's a

1284.159 --> 1288.0800000000002
plot twist to

1285.36 --> 1288.799
ball believers figuring out that

1288.08 --> 1291.4399999999998
cavendish

1288.799 --> 1293.12
actually doesn't even claim to prove

1291.44 --> 1296.0800000000002
gravity

1293.12 --> 1298.08
is like a plot twist and it forces them

1296.08 --> 1302.32
to lower the bar

1298.08 --> 1306.559
or break with the with the religion

1302.32 --> 1309.2
right so that was my little word joke

1306.559 --> 1319.84
and i've named the hangout after it hope

1309.2 --> 1319.8400000000001
you appreciate that

1323.41 --> 1326.5890000000002
[Music]

1330.84 --> 1333.84
so

1348.4 --> 1354.48
right so yeah i'm ready for chat i'm

1350.96 --> 1354.48
ready for some interactions

1354.559 --> 1358.0
probably everybody's getting out there

1356.24 --> 1359.44
coffee or just lunching

1358.0 --> 1361.28
i do it too sometimes you know on the

1359.44 --> 1364.4
flat earth debate

1361.28 --> 1367.6789999999999
i stay away and in moments where i i

1364.4 --> 1368.799
kind of want to jump in as it get in the

1367.679 --> 1371.76
way as arwyn

1368.799 --> 1373.44
typically does but yeah i'm in the

1371.76 --> 1374.48
middle of launching i'm in the middle of

1373.44 --> 1379.44
eating

1374.48 --> 1379.44
or yeah late breakfast as it is

1382.559 --> 1387.28
because yeah doing my own show for two

1385.12 --> 1389.6
hours does typically

1387.28 --> 1391.44
yeah work up an appetite for me and then

1389.6 --> 1393.52
i get hungry

1391.44 --> 1394.72
so i'm gonna make lunch somewhere during

1393.52 --> 1403.28
the flat earth debates

1394.72 --> 1417.84
usually after i've already inserted some

1403.28 --> 1417.84
all right

1428.84 --> 1431.84
hmm

1432.0 --> 1435.84
right by the way on a plane good to see

1433.919 --> 1438.96
you in chat about that

1435.84 --> 1438.9599999999998
epsom salts

1439.12 --> 1443.279
it's been a while but i recognize the

1441.12 --> 1459.84
name

1443.279 --> 1459.84
look it up again what was that about

1470.84 --> 1474.8799999999999
oh great

1477.4 --> 1480.519
[Music]

1484.84 --> 1490.32
hmm

1486.08 --> 1490.32
right so epsom salt is kind of like

1493.84 --> 1501.9189999999999
magnesium sulfate and you absorb it in

1497.12 --> 1504.8799999999999
the skin right because i have heard that

1501.919 --> 1505.76
magnesium is very good to absorb on the

1504.88 --> 1508.5590000000002
skin

1505.76 --> 1510.799
that's when with my eggs it was with a

1508.559 --> 1512.6399999999999
spray

1510.799 --> 1514.72
and that's also just on the skin that's

1512.64 --> 1518.24
how it was absorbed

1514.72 --> 1520.08
so yeah i guess

1518.24 --> 1521.44
with this stuff you could do that too

1520.08 --> 1523.36
you could basically just

1521.44 --> 1526.8400000000001
pour it in a glass and then just rub it

1523.36 --> 1529.84
over my skin that could probably work

1526.84 --> 1529.84
too

1534.6 --> 1537.6499999999999
[Music]

1540.84 --> 1543.84
hmm

1546.799 --> 1561.279
all right

1557.679 --> 1561.279
did you hear rpm

1566.64 --> 1574.5590000000002
yes it seems like uh reta

1570.159 --> 1574.5590000000002
full super villain

1575.2 --> 1586.72
he seems to be enjoying it a lot

1584.64 --> 1589.3600000000001
and i got i don't know in in a kind of a

1586.72 --> 1592.559
grabler way

1589.36 --> 1595.279
you got to respect it his tin

1592.559 --> 1597.039
his tenacity and persistence it's not

1595.279 --> 1613.44
that it's a good thing for

1597.039 --> 1615.6
for the netherlands but

1613.44 --> 1619.919
i'm wondering even like how it got to

1615.6 --> 1619.9189999999999
this how how did it get to this

1620.48 --> 1626.48
in the netherlands here how did we get

1624.84 --> 1630.08
here

1626.48 --> 1630.08
how was that possible

1636.48 --> 1641.84
eric dubay says the earth is flooded

1638.159 --> 1641.8400000000001
yeah no [ __ ]

1643.84 --> 1648.6399999999999
remember remember my weird claim that

1646.48 --> 1651.039
i'll keep repeating forever and ever and

1648.64 --> 1654.0800000000002
ever because i truly did experience it

1651.039 --> 1669.84
that i saw an eric dubai video in 2012

1654.08 --> 1669.84
on youtube yeah yeah yeah i did

1671.11 --> 1674.1699999999998
[Music]

1680.84 --> 1683.84
so

1686.399 --> 1689.6789999999999
right okay i get it propaganda that's

1689.12 --> 1691.4399999999998
how they

1689.679 --> 1697.8400000000001
get people to do what they want but then

1691.44 --> 1697.8400000000001
to just flaunt about it

1712.72 --> 1718.24
it's like when you're flaunting about

1716.399 --> 1720.8799999999999
your powers while at the same time

1718.24 --> 1721.679
you've just initiated a curfew basically

1720.88 --> 1724.5590000000002
and taking

1721.679 --> 1726.48
claim for that by flaunting it like your

1724.559 --> 1730.0
powers like this being proud

1726.48 --> 1733.1200000000001
it's not like oh [ __ ] no it's because oh

1730.0 --> 1735.44
i yeah i had to resign and all that and

1733.12 --> 1736.799
now it's gone out of hand i'm so sorry i

1735.44 --> 1738.3200000000002
could have done something about it if

1736.799 --> 1740.799
you hadn't done that right

1738.32 --> 1743.2
no no if he's just like no this was a

1740.799 --> 1745.84
plan all along is

1743.2 --> 1745.8400000000001
yeah that's

1747.279 --> 1754.0
that's not gonna make people happy

1751.12 --> 1754.6399999999999
he doesn't care i guess so i guess that

1754.0 --> 1757.12
he's just

1754.64 --> 1758.48
very confident that big tech has got his

1757.12 --> 1762.1589999999999
back

1758.48 --> 1762.159
and that it'll be strong enough

1764.96 --> 1769.52
like media political apparatus and big

1768.08 --> 1771.6
tech big finance it's just

1769.52 --> 1773.679
like oh no i'm in the new wall world

1771.6 --> 1777.279
order we've won

1773.679 --> 1777.279
and yeah i'm just playing you

1779.2 --> 1782.64
right but at the same time all the

1780.88 --> 1784.159
people here even the ones that have kind

1782.64 --> 1787.039
of

1784.159 --> 1788.48
rode along with him and trusted him or

1787.039 --> 1791.6
want

1788.48 --> 1795.44
what he wants yeah we're also being

1791.6 --> 1800.32
subjected to this stupid curfew so

1795.44 --> 1801.919
that's gonna affect everyone everyone

1800.32 --> 1803.76
[Music]

1801.919 --> 1809.8400000000001
like unless you have a helicopter or

1803.76 --> 1809.84
something you know

1823.279 --> 1826.64
so yeah this is all those people that

1825.279 --> 1829.84
are happy he is now

1826.64 --> 1830.3200000000002
in power and on their side yeah they're

1829.84 --> 1834.72
also

1830.32 --> 1838.08
enduring a curfew

1834.72 --> 1838.3990000000001
you know how long before they figure out

1838.08 --> 1841.039
that

1838.399 --> 1842.8799999999999
maybe it's not worth it maybe this is

1841.039 --> 1845.52
really stupid maybe this is

1842.88 --> 1847.1200000000001
absolutely trashing the dutch economy

1845.52 --> 1850.6399999999999
which is

1847.12 --> 1855.76
supposed to be a service economy mostly

1850.64 --> 1858.0800000000002
because of po yeah decisions in the past

1855.76 --> 1859.84
and yeah the service economy it's like

1858.08 --> 1862.399
nothing destroys the service economy

1859.84 --> 1865.039
like a freaking curfew

1862.399 --> 1866.32
because that's yeah in the evening is

1865.039 --> 1869.519
when people go out

1866.32 --> 1872.8799999999999
have fun get a little careless spend

1869.519 --> 1875.039
more money do silly things

1872.88 --> 1877.1200000000001
drink and eat and have fun and party

1875.039 --> 1881.519
right that's service economy well

1877.12 --> 1881.5189999999998
yeah that's gone it's gone so

1881.679 --> 1886.3200000000002
it's gonna be a problem one way or the

1884.88 --> 1889.2
other it's gonna have a

1886.32 --> 1890.799
trashing effect on the economy it really

1889.2 --> 1893.44
will

1890.799 --> 1896.6399999999999
it can't just replace it all with

1893.44 --> 1907.8400000000001
ordering things over the internet

1896.64 --> 1907.8400000000001
that's not gonna gratify

1910.88 --> 1915.519
government isn't you think the

1913.36 --> 1918.4799999999998
government is affected by curfew yes

1915.519 --> 1919.1200000000001
of course it is they got the pressure

1918.48 --> 1922.559
now of

1919.12 --> 1925.1999999999998
enforcing this curfew

1922.559 --> 1926.08
so they they are effectively in the

1925.2 --> 1929.3600000000001
blame for it

1926.08 --> 1932.84
and they are going to be blamed for it

1929.36 --> 1935.519
they're the cause they're gonna pay the

1932.84 --> 1936.559
price which is the trashing of the

1935.519 --> 1939.6
economy

1936.559 --> 1942.08
so yeah it's gonna damn well affect the

1939.6 --> 1942.08
government

1945.039 --> 1949.84
hello here we go again good morning

1953.76 --> 1957.44
what planes and seas thoughts on the

1956.48 --> 1959.44
diomede

1957.44 --> 1962.48
islands between russia and alaska i

1959.44 --> 1965.2
don't know what that is

1962.48 --> 1965.2
never heard of it

1971.279 --> 1977.84
there's some islands there i guess

1984.32 --> 1989.6
wait what roger what i meant is that

1988.24 --> 1991.679
they don't have to stay

1989.6 --> 1993.9189999999999
what are you saying that government

1991.679 --> 1996.159
people are not

1993.919 --> 1998.96
affected by the curfew they can still do

1996.159 --> 1998.96
whatever they like

2002.84 --> 2005.84
serious

2013.84 --> 2018.72
but even if they could like what where

2015.679 --> 2020.72
are they gonna go maybe to some

2018.72 --> 2022.08
other government people they can hang

2020.72 --> 2024.88
around with others they have

2022.08 --> 2027.6789999999999
like parties at government people's

2024.88 --> 2029.679
places maybe

2027.679 --> 2030.88
but yeah when it comes to the rest of

2029.679 --> 2033.039
the world outside

2030.88 --> 2034.64
there where where they gonna go even if

2033.039 --> 2037.2
they could

2034.64 --> 2047.8400000000001
move through the curfew everything's

2037.2 --> 2047.8400000000001
closed so what are they gonna do

2055.909 --> 2058.9680000000003
[Music]

2072.879 --> 2076.159
you need a paper from boss explaining

2075.599 --> 2080.32
why you're

2076.159 --> 2080.32
out during the curfew huh

2080.879 --> 2084.96
you know what since this is the

2082.72 --> 2088.399
netherlands

2084.96 --> 2091.599
and we yeah maybe

2088.399 --> 2093.44
maybe th this is just a new type of scam

2091.599 --> 2096.0
it's not even

2093.44 --> 2098.7200000000003
maybe it's going to work not so much

2096.0 --> 2101.839
towards like a covet passport blah blah

2098.72 --> 2102.8799999999997
and vaccine [ __ ] as well as that uh it's

2101.839 --> 2105.92
just a curfew

2102.88 --> 2109.599
but you might be able to pay

2105.92 --> 2112.7200000000003
for a special license so that you

2109.599 --> 2115.839
can go through

2112.72 --> 2117.1189999999997
like it's a a pay threshold holds like

2115.839 --> 2119.2799999999997
oh no

2117.119 --> 2121.44
you could potentially break the curfew

2119.28 --> 2123.2000000000003
but you have to have a special license

2121.44 --> 2124.48
might even go for businesses and

2123.2 --> 2126.359
restaurants and all that

2124.48 --> 2128.72
and then there's this whole new

2126.359 --> 2130.72
bureaucratic scam

2128.72 --> 2132.72
financial scam for the government to

2130.72 --> 2136.3999999999996
start parasiting on the people again

2132.72 --> 2136.3999999999996
right a new market

2137.04 --> 2140.32
i'm just thinking like a grabbler

2138.96 --> 2142.4
because that's what the freaking

2140.32 --> 2146.4
government here is that's what

2142.4 --> 2146.4
is just he is

2147.359 --> 2154.24
he is like like our hillary clinton here

2151.44 --> 2156.0
he is just maximum gravel now he's not

2154.24 --> 2157.68
like hillary clinton well maybe he is i

2156.0 --> 2158.16
don't know i don't know the details but

2157.68 --> 2160.8799999999997
he's

2158.16 --> 2162.3199999999997
pretty he doesn't really care he's like

2160.88 --> 2164.32
over the top

2162.32 --> 2165.599
he is effectively like that just

2164.32 --> 2169.6800000000003
flaunting things

2165.599 --> 2171.6800000000003
i guess but maybe that's what they want

2169.68 --> 2173.359
out of this it's just a new licensing

2171.68 --> 2176.3999999999996
scam

2173.359 --> 2179.5989999999997
like oh just more pay more

2176.4 --> 2182.2400000000002
to be able to do normal activities right

2179.599 --> 2184.079
because there's nothing more that than

2182.24 --> 2185.7599999999998
grapplers in government want than the

2184.079 --> 2188.8
just that

2185.76 --> 2192.32
pay to do anything pay to play

2188.8 --> 2194.32
right pay to play work so well with the

2192.32 --> 2197.44
new gaming industry oh

2194.32 --> 2199.92
let's apply it to everything right

2197.44 --> 2200.96
so you have to have a special permit to

2199.92 --> 2204.079
go out

2200.96 --> 2205.92
after the curfew to even have

2204.079 --> 2208.0
like a restaurant after the curfew and

2205.92 --> 2209.76
then you can receive people that have

2208.0 --> 2211.28
that same license and then you all have

2209.76 --> 2214.4
to have special

2211.28 --> 2215.8390000000004
post curfew pass something like that i

2214.4 --> 2220.8
don't know

2215.839 --> 2220.7999999999997
i'm just grabble speculating

2221.92 --> 2225.28
because otherwise it makes no sense if

2223.68 --> 2226.0
it's just going to be no no more

2225.28 --> 2229.119
activity

2226.0 --> 2233.04
it's going to trash

2229.119 --> 2233.04
right and the problem is is that

2233.76 --> 2239.92
go over the problem the government

2237.839 --> 2242.24
like they want to grabble everything but

2239.92 --> 2245.2000000000003
if there's nothing left to grabble

2242.24 --> 2247.1189999999997
then they fall so like they can't

2245.2 --> 2247.68
completely destroy the economy they have

2247.119 --> 2250.079
to keep

2247.68 --> 2251.1189999999997
kind of like ensuring it'll keep going

2250.079 --> 2254.4
so they can

2251.119 --> 2256.079
grabble it right if they just shut it

2254.4 --> 2258.8
down and it's all gone then

2256.079 --> 2261.28
they are [ __ ] too that's just a

2258.8 --> 2264.6400000000003
practical reality

2261.28 --> 2268.079
i think i think it it

2264.64 --> 2268.0789999999997
yeah definitely applies for the

2268.839 --> 2271.839
netherlands

2280.0 --> 2283.68
right george edward i know it makes no

2281.76 --> 2288.0
sense and definitely in in case of the

2283.68 --> 2290.3199999999997
coronavir is absolutely ridiculous but

2288.0 --> 2293.2
it would make more sense if they tried

2290.32 --> 2295.44
to get some kind of a licensing scam out

2293.2 --> 2295.4399999999996
of it

2296.079 --> 2301.8390000000004
it's just another thing an entry to

2299.599 --> 2304.2400000000002
another grabble scam and then eventually

2301.839 --> 2307.52
the corona virus may even be forgotten

2304.24 --> 2307.52
may just be backdrop

2307.68 --> 2311.52
it's like no no there is just the curfew

2309.839 --> 2313.599
yeah it used to be because of the corona

2311.52 --> 2314.16
fires we don't know we just have to do

2313.599 --> 2316.2400000000002
it

2314.16 --> 2318.3999999999996
oh yeah and you still want activities

2316.24 --> 2320.64
well just have to pay for that

2318.4 --> 2320.64
right

2323.44 --> 2327.2000000000003
otherwise if it's just just closed down

2325.92 --> 2330.56
it makes no sense

2327.2 --> 2330.56
it makes no damn sense

2338.079 --> 2342.0
because i don't know just i'm just

2340.24 --> 2343.04
thinking about it all these people out

2342.0 --> 2346.24
there that have

2343.04 --> 2348.96
built businesses you know

2346.24 --> 2350.0789999999997
really believed in the netherlands and

2348.96 --> 2354.48
all that and just

2350.079 --> 2356.48
like the dutch life out there

2354.48 --> 2358.0
and they're all losing their businesses

2356.48 --> 2360.32
and like with

2358.0 --> 2361.68
with any without any offering of an

2360.32 --> 2364.1600000000003
alternative

2361.68 --> 2364.7999999999997
or they're just they're holding on and

2364.16 --> 2366.8799999999997
have to

2364.8 --> 2368.7200000000003
jump for through stupid hoops just to

2366.88 --> 2370.4
keep on going and they may be very brave

2368.72 --> 2372.56
very persistent you know

2370.4 --> 2373.44
like i think a lot of dutch people are

2372.56 --> 2376.72
used to just

2373.44 --> 2379.599
bureaucracy hassling them constantly

2376.72 --> 2381.5989999999997
like even before the corona nonsense so

2379.599 --> 2383.6800000000003
there's still people holding on i think

2381.599 --> 2386.48
if they can

2383.68 --> 2388.16
to their little corner even though it's

2386.48 --> 2392.16
getting tighter and tighter

2388.16 --> 2392.72
but yeah if it all just keeps on going

2392.16 --> 2394.96
like this

2392.72 --> 2396.9599999999996
like what about all these people that

2394.96 --> 2398.8
have all lost their jobs

2396.96 --> 2400.7200000000003
that have really done their best to kind

2398.8 --> 2402.48
of build up a great society and they're

2400.72 --> 2405.839
all just

2402.48 --> 2410.88
out to dry just like that

2405.839 --> 2414.56
it's not good

2410.88 --> 2414.56
it's a lot of resentment

2414.88 --> 2419.04
towards government for good reason and

2418.16 --> 2422.7999999999997
just

2419.04 --> 2425.119
government potentially giving out checks

2422.8 --> 2427.2000000000003
is not gonna cut it because what are you

2425.119 --> 2429.2000000000003
gonna do with these checks

2427.2 --> 2431.2
you're gonna build up some new business

2429.2 --> 2435.04
how

2431.2 --> 2437.2799999999997
what new business and

2435.04 --> 2439.04
is that yeah what what is going to

2437.28 --> 2442.1600000000003
happen with the

2439.04 --> 2442.96
vacated market like isn't that basically

2442.16 --> 2444.96
going to

2442.96 --> 2449.119
damage society that there's certainly no

2444.96 --> 2449.119
more restaurants open whatsoever

2450.48 --> 2456.2400000000002
or just regular trinket shops in some

2453.52 --> 2467.839
specific area

2456.24 --> 2467.839
right it's this is not good people

2474.48 --> 2479.28
also what it what it does effectively

2477.04 --> 2482.48
and while this is more familiar

2479.28 --> 2485.52
is that it's all causing people to just

2482.48 --> 2488.72
order things online more because

2485.52 --> 2490.48
it kind of was already a little cheaper

2488.72 --> 2493.4399999999996
and now yeah you don't have much choice

2490.48 --> 2496.56
it's just like okay

2493.44 --> 2498.8
less doors are open a lot of them close

2496.56 --> 2501.92
you just have to go through the internet

2498.8 --> 2504.7200000000003
well it concentrates power

2501.92 --> 2505.839
into internet shopping and that power

2504.72 --> 2508.9599999999996
will at some point

2505.839 --> 2510.52
no point no doubtedly be abused if it

2508.96 --> 2512.319
already isn't it's already part of

2510.52 --> 2514.4
corporatization and

2512.319 --> 2516.72
mind control influences but it could get

2514.4 --> 2516.7200000000003
worse

2520.24 --> 2525.2
right and there's something missing and

2522.88 --> 2529.52
that might be forgotten and that is that

2525.2 --> 2533.359
stores where you literally go in person

2529.52 --> 2536.56
have store keepers and store keepers

2533.359 --> 2537.839
are often people or well maybe not a

2536.56 --> 2540.56
supermarket but it just

2537.839 --> 2543.599
it's their store they know about their

2540.56 --> 2546.0
inventory you can learn a lot

2543.599 --> 2546.88
and if you're just shopping online yeah

2546.0 --> 2550.0
there might be

2546.88 --> 2553.599
reviews or something you can read but

2550.0 --> 2557.04
that's you can't just ask a question

2553.599 --> 2558.7200000000003
and then expect to wrote some good story

2557.04 --> 2562.8
informative story to roll out because

2558.72 --> 2562.7999999999997
it's the internet so that's gone

2563.68 --> 2570.64
right that's not a good thing because

2567.119 --> 2574.88
store keepers do more than just

2570.64 --> 2578.0789999999997
sell products they're also

2574.88 --> 2581.359
a cultural beacon and an information

2578.079 --> 2584.5600000000004
person a lot of them that

2581.359 --> 2586.96
inform us and teach us and teach us from

2584.56 --> 2589.2799999999997
unemployed yeah unpolluted angles like

2586.96 --> 2594.079
their own personal view not necessarily

2589.28 --> 2594.079
some standardized corporate view right

2595.76 --> 2599.0400000000004
so that's that is gonna go away that's

2598.56 --> 2602.7999999999997
gonna

2599.04 --> 2606.319
leave more people less informed

2602.8 --> 2610.96
eventually and more easy to

2606.319 --> 2614.4
to go to to yeah

2610.96 --> 2616.16
to lead into specific directions through

2614.4 --> 2618.0
the internet because that's much easier

2616.16 --> 2619.839
to do in the internet

2618.0 --> 2621.44
than it is in the physical world out

2619.839 --> 2623.2799999999997
there where you're going to face people

2621.44 --> 2625.92
face to face it's another type of

2623.28 --> 2625.92
situation

2626.16 --> 2630.3999999999996
a lot of people are not so easily

2628.0 --> 2633.2
manipulated out there in the real world

2630.4 --> 2635.119
as they are on the internet because you

2633.2 --> 2637.52
have more

2635.119 --> 2638.48
abilities to fall back onto when you

2637.52 --> 2640.8
actually face

2638.48 --> 2642.8
somebody as when you're doing things

2640.8 --> 2646.8390000000004
over the internet

2642.8 --> 2649.8390000000004
right so anyway it's

2646.839 --> 2649.839
problematic

2650.8 --> 2657.6800000000003
it's not viable it's like

2654.079 --> 2661.44
it's not a viable choice

2657.68 --> 2664.3999999999996
to lay to rest with it's not like

2661.44 --> 2666.64
yeah we can do that no no you can't it's

2664.4 --> 2668.96
a really bad idea

2666.64 --> 2670.7999999999997
it's not a good outcome to funnel it all

2668.96 --> 2672.64
to the internet shopping

2670.8 --> 2674.2400000000002
and let everything close down in the

2672.64 --> 2677.839
physical world like that it's

2674.24 --> 2682.9599999999996
really bad bad for culture

2677.839 --> 2686.0789999999997
bad for people bad for morale

2682.96 --> 2690.0
bad for

2686.079 --> 2692.1600000000003
individual freedom on the long run not

2690.0 --> 2693.76
just the rules themselves taking away

2692.16 --> 2696.319
this freedom also for

2693.76 --> 2697.5200000000004
just the survival of individual freedom

2696.319 --> 2705.839
in the future

2697.52 --> 2705.839
it's bad

2718.72 --> 2720.9599999999996
hmm

2721.76 --> 2725.5200000000004
what did you comment about michael

2723.2 --> 2727.7599999999998
o'rourke hello by the way

2725.52 --> 2731.2
there's there's some words that youtube

2727.76 --> 2731.2000000000003
just bans outright

2731.52 --> 2747.839
i don't know if you noticed

2750.48 --> 2761.839
all right

2779.28 --> 2781.599
oh

2783.68 --> 2789.839
okay i can't explain that microwork

2793.14 --> 2797.3799999999997
[Music]

2799.5 --> 2802.94

2814.839 --> 2817.839

2858.72 --> 2862.8799999999997
more snow tomorrow all right cool

2869.52 --> 2877.44
all right but anyway try not to

2873.359 --> 2879.359
dwell on just like it's bad it's bad

2877.44 --> 2881.359
it's good to know how it is bad and

2879.359 --> 2882.96
where people are going to be maneuvered

2881.359 --> 2886.5589999999997
towards

2882.96 --> 2890.16
but because i'm just trying to figure

2886.559 --> 2892.1600000000003
out like how is this going to transform

2890.16 --> 2893.359
in a way where it will not result in

2892.16 --> 2897.2
everybody

2893.359 --> 2898.4
just giving up just because that might

2897.2 --> 2900.0
happen

2898.4 --> 2901.52
because they can't figure out a way

2900.0 --> 2905.359
through they

2901.52 --> 2906.559
might just give up like in a lot of ways

2905.359 --> 2914.48
people have

2906.559 --> 2918.0
gay also gave up on

2914.48 --> 2920.4
yeah gave up on going against like the

2918.0 --> 2922.24
yeah turning everything gay and

2920.4 --> 2923.28
promoting trans children and all that

2922.24 --> 2925.5989999999997
like

2923.28 --> 2928.8
a lot of people gave up going against

2925.599 --> 2930.48
that because it was just too difficult

2928.8 --> 2932.96
and they didn't understand and it was

2930.48 --> 2936.48
too aggressive and

2932.96 --> 2937.2
like so they didn't really know what to

2936.48 --> 2939.44
do and it

2937.2 --> 2940.96
and it just happened out it just rolled

2939.44 --> 2942.559
out just like that so we didn't know

2940.96 --> 2944.7200000000003
what to do against it i didn't know what

2942.559 --> 2948.3190000000004
to do against it i resisted

2944.72 --> 2951.52
i did not engage i did not virtue signal

2948.319 --> 2954.8
so yeah we risk the

2951.52 --> 2958.0
same you understand we risk

2954.8 --> 2958.0
the same with this

2958.88 --> 2965.04
risk that people will simply

2962.079 --> 2965.76
surrender to the new situation and just

2965.04 --> 2968.48
say

2965.76 --> 2969.76
yeah we live in a world where a curfew

2968.48 --> 2972.2400000000002
is normal

2969.76 --> 2974.2400000000002
it's societally engineered to be like

2972.24 --> 2977.52
this it's better for some reason

2974.24 --> 2981.1189999999997
because otherwise they wouldn't do it

2977.52 --> 2984.72
and then they just submit the

2981.119 --> 2988.319
going out night life

2984.72 --> 2991.68
shopping that is not in

2988.319 --> 2994.24
super mega corporations it's just over

2991.68 --> 2995.9199999999996
and they do we risk that and it's not

2994.24 --> 2999.5989999999997
just the netherlands it's the world

2995.92 --> 3003.28
the entire world risks surrendering

2999.599 --> 3006.0
to this enforced new thing

3003.28 --> 3008.88
surrendering and just never getting the

3006.0 --> 3008.88
old stuff back

3009.92 --> 3013.92
people will forget and then wake up to a

3013.119 --> 3015.76
world

3013.92 --> 3018.16
that is a lot more nightmarish and

3015.76 --> 3021.76
dystopian

3018.16 --> 3024.5589999999997
and in that world you will forget

3021.76 --> 3025.2000000000003
what it used to be you will forget about

3024.559 --> 3027.2000000000003
it

3025.2 --> 3028.48
not because you can't remember because

3027.2 --> 3031.839
it's too painful to

3028.48 --> 3035.44
remember because you kind of feel

3031.839 --> 3037.359
no sense it's never coming back

3035.44 --> 3039.2000000000003
and a lot of people will just surrender

3037.359 --> 3040.0
to the nightmare they'll surrender to

3039.2 --> 3043.2
the slavery to

3040.0 --> 3045.599
the new thing and it will regress

3043.2 --> 3045.5989999999997
further

3046.559 --> 3051.8390000000004
we risk that we risk people forgetting

3049.359 --> 3053.52
under the pressure of the nightmare

3051.839 --> 3056.48
that there was something to go back that

3053.52 --> 3058.96
there is something to regain

3056.48 --> 3061.28
by fighting against this regress this

3058.96 --> 3069.2
universal regress

3061.28 --> 3072.1600000000003
policy on the world

3069.2 --> 3073.359
it must be stopped it must be stopped

3072.16 --> 3077.1189999999997
and i don't know

3073.359 --> 3080.0789999999997
how this works i don't know it because

3077.119 --> 3082.0
i really feel sometimes like the entire

3080.079 --> 3085.44
world subconsciously is being presented

3082.0 --> 3088.559
with okay either a lot of people

3085.44 --> 3091.599
just die a slow death

3088.559 --> 3093.52
and just in poverty and misery and

3091.599 --> 3095.28
until there's enough people dead and

3093.52 --> 3098.24
then things might change around

3095.28 --> 3098.96
or you can try to resist do the sensible

3098.24 --> 3102.5589999999997
thing

3098.96 --> 3105.44
and then in another way like you will be

3102.559 --> 3106.88
attacked with war and then just

3105.44 --> 3108.64
slaughtered

3106.88 --> 3110.079
as an alternative is that what's

3108.64 --> 3113.92
happening like

3110.079 --> 3113.92
what is happening to this world

3117.599 --> 3122.559
is there is there just something going

3121.92 --> 3125.839
on

3122.559 --> 3129.44
in the background that actually drives

3125.839 --> 3131.839
all these things other than economy

3129.44 --> 3139.839
other than just gaining power through

3131.839 --> 3139.839
finance and marketing and monopolizing

3143.78 --> 3146.8790000000004
[Music]

3163.2 --> 3170.24
jesus there's zero cases

3166.96 --> 3174.64
zero cases the entire premise of

3170.24 --> 3177.839
corona is is misleading is false

3174.64 --> 3181.44
it's just a

3177.839 --> 3184.319
cold it's not a virus it's just a

3181.44 --> 3186.96
condition that arrives

3184.319 --> 3187.7599999999998
is symptoms it's not an infectious

3186.96 --> 3192.4
disease

3187.76 --> 3196.0
it never was every time somebody says

3192.4 --> 3199.6800000000003
x amount of cases they are already

3196.0 --> 3199.68
wrong by presupposition

3200.079 --> 3204.559
yeah i've seen its effect yeah yeah yeah

3202.4 --> 3205.599
i've seen the globe too on the telly

3204.559 --> 3210.3190000000004
i've seen it

3205.599 --> 3210.319
i've seen it so it must be real right

3210.559 --> 3213.6800000000003
you've seen the effects oh you've seen

3212.4 --> 3216.319
people with colds

3213.68 --> 3216.8799999999997
people with comorbidity situations where

3216.319 --> 3218.64
they all

3216.88 --> 3220.2400000000002
yeah they get the cold and die oh yeah

3218.64 --> 3223.2799999999997
yeah that's happened

3220.24 --> 3226.8799999999997
throughout history

3223.28 --> 3231.2000000000003
that's what happens it's not

3226.88 --> 3231.2000000000003
an infectious disease

3232.8 --> 3240.0
it's a psychosomatically triggerable

3237.2 --> 3241.2
set of symptoms that come with cleaning

3240.0 --> 3244.0
up your own body

3241.2 --> 3246.8799999999997
it's a process it's a biological

3244.0 --> 3250.72
mechanism inherent to life

3246.88 --> 3254.2400000000002
like a toxin purge

3250.72 --> 3255.04
and the devices that execute this

3254.24 --> 3259.839
process

3255.04 --> 3262.88
are viral agents they are created

3259.839 --> 3263.44
unleashed inside the body where they

3262.88 --> 3266.079
remain

3263.44 --> 3268.319
dormant ready to be utilized when it's

3266.079 --> 3270.1600000000003
called upon

3268.319 --> 3271.52
they're created in the body and it

3270.16 --> 3275.1189999999997
starts to clean up

3271.52 --> 3278.319
toxins that are also being purged

3275.119 --> 3279.119
in the process like by cells on a like

3278.319 --> 3282.079
yeah

3279.119 --> 3283.599
on a cellular level and that's what that

3282.079 --> 3285.44
is and then you get a cold you

3283.599 --> 3287.119
you got a lot of poison going through

3285.44 --> 3289.04
you in those moments because it's being

3287.119 --> 3291.839
purged it's getting out in the open

3289.04 --> 3294.799
bloodstream and at the same time other

3291.839 --> 3297.2
the viral agents are there to basically

3294.799 --> 3298.88
try to clean it up and that's yeah

3297.2 --> 3303.2799999999997
that's how you

3298.88 --> 3303.28
experience disease symptoms

3303.68 --> 3308.799
it's not an infection though

3311.2 --> 3314.799
so every time you say cases what cases

3313.44 --> 3317.119
of what

3314.799 --> 3319.52
of people just going through that

3317.119 --> 3321.359
process

3319.52 --> 3322.799
because it's not a case of being

3321.359 --> 3325.92
infected by an

3322.799 --> 3330.0
infectious spreading

3325.92 --> 3330.0
hostile takeover virus

3330.24 --> 3332.4799999999996
so

3333.76 --> 3339.8390000000004
if you're just gonna count numbers

3337.2 --> 3343.52
for yeah for this virtual concept of an

3339.839 --> 3345.64
infectious disease that spreads around

3343.52 --> 3349.839
then yeah you're already engaging in a

3345.64 --> 3349.839
presuppositional mistake

3358.34 --> 3362.3790000000004
[Music]

3374.839 --> 3377.839
so

3379.52 --> 3385.92
viruses aren't real well

3382.64 --> 3387.839
what what do you think a virus is

3385.92 --> 3389.359
i'm not saying there aren't these

3387.839 --> 3393.44
particulate

3389.359 --> 3396.48
these things right that's there

3393.44 --> 3399.92
does it do what virus

3396.48 --> 3405.839
theory says it does though

3399.92 --> 3405.839
i don't think so right

3421.98 --> 3425.17
[Music]

3447.2 --> 3453.68
yeah unfortunate reality well you should

3451.04 --> 3455.2799999999997
read your own name and just realize yeah

3453.68 --> 3459.04
that's what happens

3455.28 --> 3460.079
when you get old you get certain

3459.04 --> 3463.599
weaknesses

3460.079 --> 3464.88
and then yeah you get a cold and instead

3463.599 --> 3467.599
of just

3464.88 --> 3469.28
getting the hassle of that you die

3467.599 --> 3472.4
that's what happens it's called getting

3469.28 --> 3472.4
a cold and dying

3473.119 --> 3480.88
yeah you you know that people

3476.96 --> 3484.2400000000002
eventually die when they get old right

3480.88 --> 3489.2000000000003
or didn't i all right he's just

3484.24 --> 3490.72
burdened by it that's annoying

3489.2 --> 3492.48
right well when you're old and you get a

3490.72 --> 3494.9599999999996
cold it's a lot more burdensome because

3492.48 --> 3497.92
you already have a lot of burns

3494.96 --> 3498.96
in your body so i can imagine it's quite

3497.92 --> 3503.839
a hassle

3498.96 --> 3503.839
to just get a cold when you're old

3528.839 --> 3531.839
foreign

3533.21 --> 3536.36
[Music]

3542.839 --> 3545.839
right

3548.0 --> 3551.68
yes i know and for reality it's really

3550.72 --> 3555.04
annoying it's

3551.68 --> 3558.0789999999997
very annoying yeah

3555.04 --> 3560.88
but that sort of stuff eventually

3558.079 --> 3560.88
is gonna happen

3567.359 --> 3570.799
sorry yeah it's always it's kind of

3569.28 --> 3573.28
annoying to see that happen

3570.799 --> 3573.58
especially if you really like them you

3573.28 --> 3577.9790000000003
know

3573.58 --> 3577.979
[Music]

3578.64 --> 3582.16
like with my grandma from my mother's

3581.2 --> 3584.8799999999997
side it was

3582.16 --> 3586.5589999999997
like she got incredibly old she outlived

3584.88 --> 3589.359
my mother

3586.559 --> 3591.8390000000004
she was like in her 90s i think like 93

3589.359 --> 3594.799
or something

3591.839 --> 3595.839
and yeah at some point she was doing

3594.799 --> 3598.079
amazing

3595.839 --> 3600.96
for her age like amazing even had most

3598.079 --> 3604.4
of her faculties

3600.96 --> 3607.76
right although it was getting like

3604.4 --> 3609.359
very tough seeing tough hearing and all

3607.76 --> 3611.28
that

3609.359 --> 3614.88
but then at one day she just broke her

3611.28 --> 3615.599
hip and basically after that was just

3614.88 --> 3617.92
done

3615.599 --> 3619.04
didn't take long like she wasn't

3617.92 --> 3622.799
recovering from it

3619.04 --> 3622.799
and then at some point she just

3626.839 --> 3629.839
collapsed

3631.44 --> 3635.839
i had back then the suspicion that she

3633.599 --> 3638.0
might have been like well euthanized or

3635.839 --> 3640.24
something secretly

3638.0 --> 3641.68
was very paranoid i don't know probably

3640.24 --> 3646.0
not

3641.68 --> 3646.0
but yeah after that

3646.799 --> 3650.88
hip breaking situation it was just over

3649.44 --> 3657.839
like she just didn't

3650.88 --> 3657.839
recover from that

3664.559 --> 3671.8390000000004
hey hello julia pabin by the way good to

3666.64 --> 3671.839
see you

3696.839 --> 3702.48
hmm

3699.28 --> 3704.799
right but the point is these things

3702.48 --> 3704.799
happen

3705.92 --> 3712.079
there is no reason to

3709.04 --> 3713.839
yeah to do what is happening

3712.079 --> 3716.799
right now in the world concerning the

3713.839 --> 3718.24
covet there is no legitimate reason for

3716.799 --> 3721.68
it whatsoever

3718.24 --> 3726.0
none zero there isn't any the only

3721.68 --> 3729.5989999999997
reason it is there is to mind control us

3726.0 --> 3733.28
and to bind us into slavery so that we

3729.599 --> 3737.6800000000003
voluntarily through stress and panic and

3733.28 --> 3740.1600000000003
delusion give up the freedom we had

3737.68 --> 3742.16
we had we fought for and by being

3740.16 --> 3743.839
flustered and making bad decisions we

3742.16 --> 3745.7599999999998
give it up because we thought we had no

3743.839 --> 3748.4
choice

3745.76 --> 3751.76
that's the only reason any of this is

3748.4 --> 3751.76
here it's the only

3752.839 --> 3755.839
reason

3758.64 --> 3762.64
and i think that when this is all over

3763.359 --> 3766.5589999999997
like there's gonna be some grave

3764.96 --> 3769.119
consequences although

3766.559 --> 3770.0
yeah well maybe they'll just get away

3769.119 --> 3772.4
with it

3770.0 --> 3774.16
like when it ends people might be so

3772.4 --> 3776.48
relieved that it's finally over that

3774.16 --> 3778.319
they'll just be too forgiving and let

3776.48 --> 3780.16
them all get away with it

3778.319 --> 3782.88
it's like no it's okay because at least

3780.16 --> 3786.319
we got our freedom back

3782.88 --> 3790.6400000000003
and then yeah

3786.319 --> 3793.92
maybe but this is just such a

3790.64 --> 3797.1189999999997
blatant offense it's like

3793.92 --> 3800.48
corporations and government people not

3797.119 --> 3803.2000000000003
necessarily governments like nations but

3800.48 --> 3804.079
government people have conspired with

3803.2 --> 3808.16
corporations

3804.079 --> 3810.48
and news media against

3808.16 --> 3811.44
the people of the world against free

3810.48 --> 3812.96
public

3811.44 --> 3814.88
you see it's not even against the

3812.96 --> 3817.2
country necessarily although

3814.88 --> 3818.319
some countries get it worse than others

3817.2 --> 3822.5589999999997
it's against

3818.319 --> 3822.5589999999997
free public it's a conspiracy

3822.839 --> 3829.7599999999998
politicians media

3826.4 --> 3833.119
corporations against

3829.76 --> 3835.5200000000004
the public universal public

3833.119 --> 3836.559
it's a mind control operation to bind

3835.52 --> 3839.92
everybody

3836.559 --> 3841.44
away from well what we what

3839.92 --> 3843.28
yeah sovereign freedom although

3841.44 --> 3845.76
sovereign is a problematic word

3843.28 --> 3846.799
we're not just a gold coin right but

3845.76 --> 3850.7200000000003
personal

3846.799 --> 3854.24
freedom and responsibility and just

3850.72 --> 3857.839
that we can decide our own destiny

3854.24 --> 3860.4799999999996
a way into a neo-feudal technocracy

3857.839 --> 3862.0789999999997
form of slavery with a lot of mind

3860.48 --> 3865.039
control

3862.079 --> 3866.319
and just hassle to keep people busy to

3865.039 --> 3881.8390000000004
prevent them from

3866.319 --> 3881.839
retaining freedom status

3892.839 --> 3896.48
right

3894.16 --> 3898.3999999999996
oh i yeah i would love to try

3896.48 --> 3899.68
homesteading but i am very nervous

3898.4 --> 3902.48
though

3899.68 --> 3903.839
about it like would i do good like

3902.48 --> 3905.839
there's certain things i like but

3903.839 --> 3907.839
there's also certain things

3905.839 --> 3909.52
of my character that'll get in the way

3907.839 --> 3911.2799999999997
that i foresee

3909.52 --> 3913.2
so it's not going to be easy for me to

3911.28 --> 3915.76
do that but i definitely do

3913.2 --> 3917.52
have some skills that will definitely

3915.76 --> 3920.48
help

3917.52 --> 3921.119
and i do have this spirit for the family

3920.48 --> 3923.839
unit

3921.119 --> 3924.7200000000003
i'm like i would make it into my group

3923.839 --> 3927.68
of course

3924.72 --> 3928.72
like that's normal right although some

3927.68 --> 3930.319
people don't get that

3928.72 --> 3932.24
instinct as much and they get more

3930.319 --> 3936.079
retreative it's very

3932.24 --> 3939.2799999999997
not good i will be very dedicated

3936.079 --> 3941.3590000000004
but that's not enough though because

3939.28 --> 3943.6800000000003
if i'm truly gonna homestead and try to

3941.359 --> 3945.5989999999997
defend for example my kids growing up

3943.68 --> 3946.24
against the negative influence from the

3945.599 --> 3948.1600000000003
outside i

3946.24 --> 3950.4799999999996
am how am i gonna do that how am i gonna

3948.16 --> 3951.2
give them the trust and the confidence

3950.48 --> 3955.039
that they

3951.2 --> 3958.0789999999997
can choose a path

3955.039 --> 3958.7200000000003
not joining the mind control society out

3958.079 --> 3960.799
there

3958.72 --> 3962.3999999999996
because it is going to tempt them it

3960.799 --> 3966.48
always does it tempted

3962.4 --> 3968.4
me and i fell for it when i was young

3966.48 --> 3970.96
i fell for it in ways not for the

3968.4 --> 3974.64
demonic side but i felt for the naive

3970.96 --> 3976.319
feel that it was good and that i should

3974.64 --> 3980.48
adapt

3976.319 --> 3983.52
i fell for that as a kid how do i

3980.48 --> 3985.839
help prevent that from happening to my

3983.52 --> 3985.839
kids

3987.359 --> 3994.16
i don't know yet but i'm i trust that

3991.28 --> 3996.0
if i am going to engage i will find out

3994.16 --> 3998.48
one way or the other

3996.0 --> 4000.16
but it's going to be important to have

3998.48 --> 4004.839
an agreement with this

4000.16 --> 4007.44
with my wife whenever i'm going to meet

4004.839 --> 4010.5589999999997
her

4007.44 --> 4010.88
right yeah but how do i prevent them

4010.559 --> 4014.0
from

4010.88 --> 4015.839
really stepping into problems that they

4014.0 --> 4016.319
won't be able to get out of or that are

4015.839 --> 4018.96
gonna

4016.319 --> 4020.44
haunt them for the rest of their lives

4018.96 --> 4022.799
without just

4020.44 --> 4024.64
authoritarian wise take away their

4022.799 --> 4026.0
choices just say as a parent like no

4024.64 --> 4035.839
you're not allowed to do that and i'm

4026.0 --> 4035.839
going to enforce that

4038.16 --> 4044.96
prevent them you guide them right

4043.119 --> 4046.559
well i'll definitely have the mental

4044.96 --> 4049.44
flexibility

4046.559 --> 4051.3590000000004
in order to basically go into

4049.44 --> 4054.079
presuppositional routes that they'll be

4051.359 --> 4054.0789999999997
interested in

4054.4 --> 4057.039
who knows

4060.16 --> 4063.839
but anyway i'm not there yet

4064.0 --> 4071.119
gotta get some finances together

4067.359 --> 4073.0389999999998
some more it might happen and a wife

4071.119 --> 4074.799
and actually a home and then the

4073.039 --> 4075.6800000000003
determination that that is what i'm

4074.799 --> 4078.16
gonna do

4075.68 --> 4079.9199999999996
because at the same time i've also

4078.16 --> 4082.0789999999997
realized if i'm gonna get some kind of a

4079.92 --> 4084.4
home

4082.079 --> 4085.76
a better financial situation then it's

4084.4 --> 4088.64
also going to be for me

4085.76 --> 4089.039
like okay this means i can go out and

4088.64 --> 4090.8799999999997
build

4089.039 --> 4093.28
like a social life from a position of

4090.88 --> 4096.400000000001
confidence again

4093.28 --> 4096.400000000001
or try it again

4098.239 --> 4101.44
so even if i meet my wife is that mean

4100.96 --> 4104.08
that we're

4101.44 --> 4104.96
immediately just gonna create a home

4104.08 --> 4107.199
like that

4104.96 --> 4109.44
or is it better to get to know them

4107.199 --> 4110.879999999999
first or set out for some mission or

4109.44 --> 4112.639999999999
like build a business to get i don't

4110.88 --> 4119.839
know yet where it'll go

4112.64 --> 4119.839
like that

4130.839 --> 4133.839
okay

4142.14 --> 4147.839
[Music]

4144.839 --> 4147.839
hmm

4151.12 --> 4161.839
okay michael rock that's pretty creepy

4173.279 --> 4178.370000000001
all right jeddah that's really cool

4175.2 --> 4178.37
[Music]

4181.759 --> 4185.12
i may have had that opportunity as well

4184.0 --> 4187.92
but i seem to have

4185.12 --> 4189.04
passed on it maybe i didn't get it i i

4187.92 --> 4192.96
was afraid

4189.04 --> 4192.96
of getting kids when i was very young

4194.0 --> 4198.08
because i didn't have the confidence

4195.6 --> 4199.76
about myself being able to actually do a

4198.08 --> 4201.84
good job at it

4199.76 --> 4203.76
and i didn't want it because i wanted to

4201.84 --> 4206.96
freedom it was just a scaredy cat

4203.76 --> 4209.12
scaredy cat scaredy cat being all vain

4206.96 --> 4213.04
and like oh i'm special boy

4209.12 --> 4214.32
yeah i like to be very harsh on myself

4213.04 --> 4218.48
like that

4214.32 --> 4220.799999999999
but that's practically what i was

4218.48 --> 4223.199
and it was very embarrassed about it too

4220.8 --> 4225.04
it's like i wanted to be brave but i

4223.199 --> 4225.678999999999
wasn't and i was very conflicted about

4225.04 --> 4230.32
it it's like

4225.679 --> 4233.12
no then i hate myself

4230.32 --> 4234.96
but yeah it's just taken a lot longer

4233.12 --> 4236.159
and that is also why i eventually

4234.96 --> 4239.28
figured out like okay

4236.159 --> 4240.96
just punishing yourself for not being

4239.28 --> 4242.8
able to do something

4240.96 --> 4244.719
is not going to affect anything it's not

4242.8 --> 4246.8
going to change it

4244.719 --> 4249.44
so what is this what's going on and then

4246.8 --> 4252.0
i discovered i'm a slow grower

4249.44 --> 4254.32
but once i grow into something i become

4252.0 --> 4256.96
very good at it

4254.32 --> 4259.36
but i'd have to find the right moment to

4256.96 --> 4273.84
actually engage

4259.36 --> 4273.839999999999
it takes time with me

4295.52 --> 4301.84
wait for who you're praying secret asian

4298.84 --> 4301.84
man

4327.6 --> 4333.84
oh there oh god

4331.36 --> 4333.839999999999
he did

4334.719 --> 4339.04
like the covet shot my god

4339.199 --> 4343.919999999999
why doesn't he know it's basically

4342.4 --> 4348.799999999999
turned to you in a gm

4343.92 --> 4357.84
gmh a genetically modified human

4348.8 --> 4357.84
like don't people realize that

4364.08 --> 4370.96
and he knew it so

4367.76 --> 4372.400000000001
what why did you actually

4370.96 --> 4374.4800000000005
hear him out like what's the

4372.4 --> 4377.44
philosophical reason

4374.48 --> 4378.5599999999995
for him to think it's okay to do that to

4377.44 --> 4381.919999999999
literally

4378.56 --> 4385.6
modify himself like that or let himself

4381.92 --> 4389.12
be modified like that

4385.6 --> 4389.120000000001
by mega corporations

4389.84 --> 4393.6
what was his justification secret asian

4392.8 --> 4399.84
man

4393.6 --> 4399.84
have you asked

4402.159 --> 4409.839999999999
okay so

4405.44 --> 4413.28
wow so it basically just said no i'm

4409.84 --> 4415.12
going to take it and if i'm going to die

4413.28 --> 4417.92
if it all turns out to be a lie

4415.12 --> 4418.64
so be it i am with the dream and i'll

4417.92 --> 4421.4400000000005
die

4418.64 --> 4422.88
for the dream is that it is he like that

4421.44 --> 4425.28
so he can't handle the world

4422.88 --> 4426.159000000001
it's like okay well euthanize me then

4425.28 --> 4429.199
cause i will

4426.159 --> 4441.839999999999
not surrender the dream

4429.199 --> 4441.839999999999
is that it is he one of that

4444.97 --> 4448.169
[Music]

4463.199 --> 4466.639999999999
all right

4464.76 --> 4468.96
[Music]

4466.64 --> 4472.2390000000005
well that sucks sucks to lose your

4468.96 --> 4472.2390000000005
entire family like that

4473.76 --> 4478.96
so i guess it's people have seen too

4477.52 --> 4481.120000000001
much science fiction

4478.96 --> 4483.12
they think that it's okay to just let

4481.12 --> 4484.719
themselves get genetically modified like

4483.12 --> 4486.96
that

4484.719 --> 4486.96
wow

4490.32 --> 4494.48
well my only conclusion is is apparently

4492.56 --> 4496.719
time for

4494.48 --> 4497.919999999999
a vast amount of people in the world to

4496.719 --> 4501.92
die then

4497.92 --> 4506.08
it's time yeah they don't care anymore

4501.92 --> 4506.08
they don't care anymore for extinction

4508.32 --> 4511.599999999999
as long as it's not too overt as long as

4510.48 --> 4514.959999999999
they don't have to

4511.6 --> 4515.52
face images in their mind of people

4514.96 --> 4518.719
being

4515.52 --> 4520.8
shot in the head dead

4518.719 --> 4523.679
on the sidewalk as long as they don't

4520.8 --> 4528.56
have to face that

4523.679 --> 4531.76
then they'll be glad to be exterminated

4528.56 --> 4535.04
on the long run if they can just

4531.76 --> 4535.04
hold on to the dream

4535.36 --> 4539.5199999999995
oh that's exactly what's gonna happen so

4538.56 --> 4542.159000000001
i guess that in

4539.52 --> 4543.4400000000005
20 years 30 years it's just going to be

4542.159 --> 4546.639999999999
this discovery like

4543.44 --> 4548.4
hey yeah a quarter of humanity isn't

4546.64 --> 4550.400000000001
really human anymore and they're having

4548.4 --> 4552.0
procreation problems and hey

4550.4 --> 4553.599999999999
even like the therapies don't help

4552.0 --> 4555.76
anymore no they're just not getting

4553.6 --> 4558.8
children anymore they're just

4555.76 --> 4561.52
going to grow old and frustrated and die

4558.8 --> 4561.52
betrayed

4562.56 --> 4566.96
and yeah whatever's going to be left is

4564.48 --> 4571.839999999999
left and just the giant consequences

4566.96 --> 4571.84
economically and all that and yeah

4576.719 --> 4580.08
all right i guess i guess that the mind

4579.6 --> 4584.4800000000005
control

4580.08 --> 4587.679
has won then if a big

4584.48 --> 4589.04
or a majority of people are so enslaved

4587.679 --> 4592.96
to the dream

4589.04 --> 4595.36
that they would be extincted for it

4592.96 --> 4597.04
as long as they don't have to know that

4595.36 --> 4598.799999999999
it's really happen as long as they

4597.04 --> 4600.8
can just take something and then

4598.8 --> 4604.2390000000005
continue like everything is all right

4600.8 --> 4604.2390000000005
and then they'll find out that

4604.4 --> 4609.839999999999
yeah what the damage is afterwards

4610.08 --> 4614.64
that's okay with people it's like wow

4613.04 --> 4618.239
it's an investment opportunity

4614.64 --> 4622.0
just just die just

4618.239 --> 4624.4
slowly die no longer really

4622.0 --> 4626.719
be human have severe problems that you

4624.4 --> 4629.36
won't be able to fix later on

4626.719 --> 4631.28
it's just so you can pretend just a few

4629.36 --> 4633.28
more moments like everything is all

4631.28 --> 4635.199
glorious and fine oh look at this

4633.28 --> 4638.159
magnificent civilization where

4635.199 --> 4642.0
everything is possible

4638.159 --> 4644.879999999999
so just the mere suggestion and idea

4642.0 --> 4646.0
that that is still a viable option will

4644.88 --> 4648.400000000001
allow you

4646.0 --> 4649.52
to inject yours with some yeah with

4648.4 --> 4652.639999999999
something that is

4649.52 --> 4655.76
going to effectively modify

4652.64 --> 4657.360000000001
you into a non-human with human

4655.76 --> 4662.2390000000005
appearance

4657.36 --> 4664.08
is it are people that enslaved

4662.239 --> 4666.799999999999
here's where here's where my dark side

4664.08 --> 4670.159
comes in and says okay

4666.8 --> 4672.400000000001
good die then get the

4670.159 --> 4673.839999999999
[ __ ] out of this world because this

4672.4 --> 4676.639999999999
world is hell

4673.84 --> 4677.4400000000005
and if you're too [ __ ] weak to deal

4676.64 --> 4680.96
with it

4677.44 --> 4680.96
then die

4681.92 --> 4686.4
and i know nobody likes to hear that

4684.56 --> 4686.88
especially if it's your own family and

4686.4 --> 4688.879999999999
all that

4686.88 --> 4690.32
and hey i might be confronted with for

4688.88 --> 4693.04
example my brother being

4690.32 --> 4693.759999999999
stupid enough to go for that because

4693.04 --> 4697.04
he's so

4693.76 --> 4697.04
willing to double down

4697.52 --> 4702.96
on not not accepting reality and just

4701.36 --> 4704.799999999999
like no no

4702.96 --> 4706.2390000000005
i don't know maybe he's not maybe i'm

4704.8 --> 4706.96
insulting him right now i haven't

4706.239 --> 4709.919999999999
contacted him

4706.96 --> 4711.44
for ages so maybe he knows now this is

4709.92 --> 4712.64
absolutely ridiculousness i'm never

4711.44 --> 4713.28
going to do that never going to allow my

4712.64 --> 4716.400000000001
kids to

4713.28 --> 4718.08
but maybe he will maybe just as a

4716.4 --> 4719.44
virtual signal doubled i don't know how

4718.08 --> 4721.5199999999995
he's like i don't

4719.44 --> 4724.719
know i don't know my brother anymore i'm

4721.52 --> 4727.1990000000005
kind of ashamed like that

4724.719 --> 4729.28
just didn't really connect after some

4727.199 --> 4732.239
point

4729.28 --> 4733.36
he doesn't call me i don't call him

4732.239 --> 4738.0
anymore

4733.36 --> 4740.719
i've tried it years ago

4738.0 --> 4743.12
and so he might just do that and then

4740.719 --> 4747.36
it's going to be okay well i guess that

4743.12 --> 4751.76
this branch of the family deserves to go

4747.36 --> 4754.719
extinct because is that weak

4751.76 --> 4755.280000000001
and it's the time where weakness of mind

4754.719 --> 4758.56
and heart

4755.28 --> 4760.88
causes you to go extinct do you

4758.56 --> 4763.52
understand

4760.88 --> 4765.76
and it's a whole lot of people a whole

4763.52 --> 4768.159000000001
lot of people that cannot handle

4765.76 --> 4768.96
that things can just change around like

4768.159 --> 4770.639999999999
that

4768.96 --> 4772.32
and now you're threatened now you're

4770.64 --> 4773.679
assaulted

4772.32 --> 4775.5199999999995
and they can't handle it they can't

4773.679 --> 4779.52
handle it so badly

4775.52 --> 4783.120000000001
they'll allow themselves to go extinct

4779.52 --> 4786.88
just for the [ __ ] short-term idea

4783.12 --> 4790.159
that everything is all right yeah

4786.88 --> 4793.28
oh if you're that weak then you deserve

4790.159 --> 4796.799999999999
to go extinct and die

4793.28 --> 4799.92
you got it deserve it

4796.8 --> 4802.8
it's very rude very hard for me to say

4799.92 --> 4804.0
but at this point it's just the [ __ ]

4802.8 --> 4807.04
reality i can't do

4804.0 --> 4810.4
anything about it anymore if you've got

4807.04 --> 4813.5199999999995
so many bad habits so many going along

4810.4 --> 4814.4
together long habits that you will fall

4813.52 --> 4817.6
for this one

4814.4 --> 4818.48
then you deserve everything that's gonna

4817.6 --> 4821.1990000000005
come to you

4818.48 --> 4821.678999999999
you deserve to be modified no longer be

4821.199 --> 4825.239
human

4821.679 --> 4828.639
you deserve painful issues

4825.239 --> 4832.0
malformations in your children

4828.639 --> 4835.1990000000005
all that [ __ ] you deserve it

4832.0 --> 4840.239
you deserve it because you're [ __ ]

4835.199 --> 4843.919999999999
weak you're weak and you deserve to

4840.239 --> 4847.12
die for your weakness and your inability

4843.92 --> 4850.0
to step out of that created dream for us

4847.12 --> 4852.76
that created dream world that isn't real

4850.0 --> 4854.8
if you can't step out of it then you

4852.76 --> 4861.84
deserve

4854.8 --> 4861.84
what you get

4873.44 --> 4881.678999999999
yeah and that is also

4878.0 --> 4884.96
a part of my create cremation of care

4881.679 --> 4887.36
you know i can't afford to care

4884.96 --> 4888.32
anymore about people that are that

4887.36 --> 4892.639
willing

4888.32 --> 4897.44
to double down onto death i can't afford

4892.639 --> 4899.4400000000005
to care about them even if it's close

4897.44 --> 4901.5199999999995
you know and if it was somebody very

4899.44 --> 4904.08
close say for example my dad

4901.52 --> 4905.6
would fall into some kind of desperation

4904.08 --> 4908.159
it's like i have to do this

4905.6 --> 4909.04
i would go to him i would smack the [ __ ]

4908.159 --> 4912.0
out of him

4909.04 --> 4913.5199999999995
in a way that won't damage him until he

4912.0 --> 4916.719
snaps out of that

4913.52 --> 4918.639
because that's the only viable course

4916.719 --> 4919.84
if somebody's getting that desperate to

4918.639 --> 4922.88
do that

4919.84 --> 4925.12
they should be smacked the [ __ ] out of

4922.88 --> 4925.12
it

4925.52 --> 4932.639
because otherwise it's it's over

4930.8 --> 4933.92
you don't even know what it's gonna do

4932.639 --> 4937.12
with them

4933.92 --> 4939.36
but you can sure as hell count on that

4937.12 --> 4944.0
it's not gonna be good

4939.36 --> 4959.759999999999
it's probably gonna be very bad

4944.0 --> 4962.0
in a cumulative way on the long run

4959.76 --> 4962.0
right

4967.679 --> 4975.4400000000005
right so it comes down to almost like in

4972.08 --> 4977.5199999999995
i think alex jones ian archive he was

4975.44 --> 4978.879999999999
been he's been very eloquent at pointing

4977.52 --> 4982.2390000000005
this out

4978.88 --> 4986.32
in between all the uh

4982.239 --> 4989.839999999999
the infotainment and that is just like

4986.32 --> 4994.0
yeah if you don't stand up and stop

4989.84 --> 4995.12
it from unfolding if you're okay with

4994.0 --> 4997.6
all that to happen

4995.12 --> 4998.4
then you will be subjected and if you

4997.6 --> 5000.0
then

4998.4 --> 5001.92
yes subjected to these things like

5000.0 --> 5005.84
vaccines and all that and

5001.92 --> 5007.92
lockdowns and if you're okay with that

5005.84 --> 5009.28
or you're okay with just being a

5007.92 --> 5012.8
complainy pants

5009.28 --> 5013.28
afterwards person if you're okay with

5012.8 --> 5017.360000000001
that

5013.28 --> 5018.239
then yeah if you're not gonna stand up

5017.36 --> 5021.44
and just

5018.239 --> 5021.44
complain in the distance

5021.76 --> 5025.92
well then yeah it's gonna go to the next

5024.88 --> 5028.96
step

5025.92 --> 5031.52
until yeah because

5028.96 --> 5032.8
look people we don't have a choice you

5031.52 --> 5035.120000000001
don't have a choice

5032.8 --> 5036.4800000000005
you don't have a choice not really you

5035.12 --> 5040.639
don't have a choice

5036.48 --> 5040.638999999999
you can only conjure up a choice

5041.28 --> 5045.5199999999995
and in that choice you're going to make

5043.52 --> 5048.56
that choice you're going to

5045.52 --> 5051.84
choose surrender and die so it's

5048.56 --> 5055.1990000000005
resist and have hell

5051.84 --> 5058.400000000001
unleashed or surrender and

5055.199 --> 5063.678999999999
die no other choice

5058.4 --> 5067.599999999999
it is literal hell the hell of change

5063.679 --> 5071.28
it's what it is there is no other choice

5067.6 --> 5085.84
resist and go through hell or surrender

5071.28 --> 5085.84
and die

5086.58 --> 5091.989
[Music]

5095.22 --> 5101.34
[Music]

5107.92 --> 5112.96
right and guys with all this stupid

5110.96 --> 5113.76
covert vaccine [ __ ] that's going

5112.96 --> 5117.36
down now

5113.76 --> 5120.400000000001
right i'd believe that in say 10

5117.36 --> 5122.799999999999
20 years it's probably going to be

5120.4 --> 5124.4
insurance related but not in the way you

5122.8 --> 5126.4800000000005
think you see

5124.4 --> 5128.0
at first insurance now within the

5126.48 --> 5129.5199999999995
corporate takeover they're going to

5128.0 --> 5130.88
encourage you doing that

5129.52 --> 5132.719
getting that because then you get the

5130.88 --> 5135.4400000000005
preference policies blah blah blah blah

5132.719 --> 5136.88
but when it's all over it's going to be

5135.44 --> 5138.879999999999
the other way around

5136.88 --> 5140.88
yeah you're going to have like oh you

5138.88 --> 5142.4800000000005
have had these vaccines

5140.88 --> 5145.04
that means you're going to pay more

5142.48 --> 5147.199
because you're [ __ ] up now

5145.04 --> 5148.08
you're going to be much more likely to

5147.199 --> 5150.638999999999
get into

5148.08 --> 5151.679
physical problems and diseases so you're

5150.639 --> 5156.96
going to pay

5151.679 --> 5159.76
more now than the ones that didn't do it

5156.96 --> 5160.88
huh huh oh you thought you had an

5159.76 --> 5163.52
advantage

5160.88 --> 5164.0
oh they told you so oh they told you it

5163.52 --> 5168.4800000000005
was

5164.0 --> 5171.76
easier you're going to pay more

5168.48 --> 5174.799999999999
than the ones that haven't huh

5171.76 --> 5176.4800000000005
huh you're gonna like it you're not

5174.8 --> 5180.159000000001
gonna like it

5176.48 --> 5180.718999999999
oh that's too bad maybe you shouldn't

5180.159 --> 5185.839999999999
have been

5180.719 --> 5185.84
a [ __ ] [ __ ] then

5192.57 --> 5197.84
[Music]

5194.84 --> 5197.84
huh

5202.56 --> 5207.04
i've never had a flu shot not a single

5204.88 --> 5211.36
time

5207.04 --> 5214.4
not a single time

5211.36 --> 5214.719
but when i figured out there was such a

5214.4 --> 5217.759999999999
thing

5214.719 --> 5219.36
i was already outraged

5217.76 --> 5221.360000000001
i was already outright i already know

5219.36 --> 5224.0
this is ridiculous

5221.36 --> 5224.639
like i already knew back in the past

5224.0 --> 5227.199
that

5224.639 --> 5229.04
having a cold is not an infectious

5227.199 --> 5230.48
disease and i've had like bacterial

5229.04 --> 5234.159
infections

5230.48 --> 5238.08
right like in a wound and [ __ ] got sick

5234.159 --> 5241.199
like that can happen like bacteria yeah

5238.08 --> 5244.32
they can be invasive species almost

5241.199 --> 5247.5199999999995
like thing right a cold

5244.32 --> 5249.759999999999
is not that i already knew that way back

5247.52 --> 5252.4800000000005
i haven't thought it through too much

5249.76 --> 5255.84
but i already knew like this is not

5252.48 --> 5258.5599999999995
like a regular disease so a vaccination

5255.84 --> 5262.0
is ridiculous it doesn't even work

5258.56 --> 5263.04
with the bacteria like doing vaccines

5262.0 --> 5266.4
with bacteria

5263.04 --> 5268.159
is already tough enough because over

5266.4 --> 5270.96
time they mutate well even

5268.159 --> 5272.4
with the offset theory of viruses being

5270.96 --> 5274.4
infectious things

5272.4 --> 5277.44
it mutates too quick anyway it's too

5274.4 --> 5281.12
elusive you can't

5277.44 --> 5284.0
vaccinate against viruses even

5281.12 --> 5285.44
if you presuppose viruses are what they

5284.0 --> 5288.159
say they are

5285.44 --> 5289.28
right it's just it's another baller

5288.159 --> 5293.12
stupidity

5289.28 --> 5294.88
spiral it's so stupid everything about

5293.12 --> 5299.12
it is [ __ ]

5294.88 --> 5302.639
everything flu vaccine

5299.12 --> 5306.239
industry is a euthanization

5302.639 --> 5309.4400000000005
industry for [ __ ] retards

5306.239 --> 5313.44
you understand it's a euthanization

5309.44 --> 5323.839999999999
industry for retards

5313.44 --> 5323.839999999999
you get it

5336.08 --> 5341.199
all right anyway i'll be back in in two

5348.84 --> 5351.84
minutes

5404.84 --> 5407.84
so

5446.84 --> 5449.84
huh

5462.4 --> 5466.32
what are we talking about this morning

5464.08 --> 5466.32
uh

5466.48 --> 5469.678999999999
social engineering

5474.84 --> 5480.159000000001
uh

5476.199 --> 5482.879999999999
vaccinations a lot and just the position

5480.159 --> 5482.879999999999
people are in

5483.04 --> 5491.12
that'll take this freaking covet vaccine

5486.56 --> 5494.159000000001
and what it really means on the long run

5491.12 --> 5495.599999999999
so i'm literally calling this a

5494.159 --> 5497.759999999999
prediction

5495.6 --> 5499.120000000001
literally i want it registered i already

5497.76 --> 5500.56
spoke it out right i'm not going to

5499.12 --> 5504.0
repeat it

5500.56 --> 5508.56
that is that at first like

5504.0 --> 5511.6
the health insurances will encourage you

5508.56 --> 5513.52
probably some of them will encourage you

5511.6 --> 5517.04
to get a covet vaccine

5513.52 --> 5520.320000000001
right and they'll might even offer you

5517.04 --> 5523.44
benefits and all this like ooh cheaper

5520.32 --> 5525.92
whatever yeah yeah that's right now in

5523.44 --> 5529.199
the future

5525.92 --> 5529.679
i don't know how long it'll be maybe

5529.199 --> 5532.32
very

5529.679 --> 5533.04
maybe very close maybe he'll suddenly

5532.32 --> 5538.08
switch around

5533.04 --> 5541.12
or it'll sip seek sip in later

5538.08 --> 5542.239
after after this is all over or maybe

5541.12 --> 5543.679
like that never maybe

5542.239 --> 5546.48
he'll never even get to that it's just

5543.679 --> 5548.159
going to be the euthanization mechanism

5546.48 --> 5550.0
and just kill a lot of people and that's

5548.159 --> 5551.679
it or sterilize them whatever

5550.0 --> 5554.0
but if there is going to be some

5551.679 --> 5557.36
resemblance of a free society

5554.0 --> 5558.719
after this then health insurances will

5557.36 --> 5562.48
eventually

5558.719 --> 5564.4800000000005
reveal the natural logical consequences

5562.48 --> 5567.199
of the covet vaccine and instead of

5564.48 --> 5569.199
promoting it for whatever incentive

5567.199 --> 5571.12
they're going to say okay you had you

5569.199 --> 5574.638999999999
had these vaccines okay

5571.12 --> 5576.639
then you're going to have to pay more

5574.639 --> 5578.56
because you're a bigger health risk

5576.639 --> 5581.04
right remember like

5578.56 --> 5583.6
are you a smoker are you a smoker oh

5581.04 --> 5586.159
that makes you at a higher risk

5583.6 --> 5586.159000000001
guess what

5587.12 --> 5593.199
vaccine higher risk

5590.159 --> 5594.48
yeah higher risk fact seed it's gonna

5593.199 --> 5597.36
cost more

5594.48 --> 5598.959999999999
yeah you you thought vaccines were cool

5597.36 --> 5601.12
that was helpful right

5598.96 --> 5602.2390000000005
well guess what it's the other way

5601.12 --> 5603.679
around

5602.239 --> 5606.48
it's the other way around it's gonna

5603.679 --> 5607.12
cost more if you're taking vaccines in

5606.48 --> 5610.159
the future

5607.12 --> 5611.599999999999
yeah it's gonna cost you more for your

5610.159 --> 5615.04
health insurance

5611.6 --> 5619.360000000001
yeah oh you don't think it's possible

5615.04 --> 5623.6
why because you believe you believe

5619.36 --> 5626.88
in the vaccine do you ah

5623.6 --> 5629.679
in the future if you had vaccines

5626.88 --> 5630.719
gonna cost you more for your health

5629.679 --> 5634.0
insurance

5630.719 --> 5636.4800000000005
yeah enjoy it you deserve it

5634.0 --> 5637.28
you deserve every [ __ ] little bit of

5636.48 --> 5640.0
it

5637.28 --> 5642.239
you're going to be whiny complaining old

5640.0 --> 5643.76
[ __ ]

5642.239 --> 5646.48
you're going to be the next generation

5643.76 --> 5647.84
of boomers the covet boomers is what

5646.48 --> 5650.799999999999
you're going to be

5647.84 --> 5651.92
those stupid [ __ ] retards that took

5650.8 --> 5653.04
it

5651.92 --> 5656.56
that's what you're going to be you're

5653.04 --> 5656.56
going to be the covet boomers

5657.53 --> 5660.62
[Applause]

5663.52 --> 5667.4400000000005
so good luck with that yes

5669.6 --> 5673.4400000000005
if hey if all of them survive you know

5671.92 --> 5676.719
because

5673.44 --> 5678.32
now i'm assuming i'm going from the

5676.719 --> 5679.44
vantage point that those who take the

5678.32 --> 5682.799999999999
covet

5679.44 --> 5684.638999999999
vaccine can actually survive

5682.8 --> 5686.56
because you know all the instant

5684.639 --> 5688.8
reaction people literally just

5686.56 --> 5689.679
convulsing freaking dying from the code

5688.8 --> 5691.360000000001
vaccine oh look

5689.679 --> 5693.92
another person died from taking the

5691.36 --> 5696.96
covert vaccine well yeah

5693.92 --> 5698.4800000000005
yeah of course the instant death sure

5696.96 --> 5700.56
you know that's not gonna prevent people

5698.48 --> 5701.04
from taking it it's like oh look at all

5700.56 --> 5703.360000000001
these

5701.04 --> 5704.8
thousands of people on camera dying oh

5703.36 --> 5707.92
well let's take it

5704.8 --> 5715.4400000000005
right now let's see if i'm gonna die

5707.92 --> 5717.28
because i'm smart right

5715.44 --> 5719.44
they're still going to do it though it's

5717.28 --> 5719.44
just

5722.0 --> 5726.159
yeah wait i was always losing my point

5724.8 --> 5730.4800000000005
yeah the instant deaths

5726.159 --> 5732.239
sure sure but we don't exactly know

5730.48 --> 5733.759999999999
the genetic modification what it's going

5732.239 --> 5736.638999999999
to do it might be that you're

5733.76 --> 5739.92
effectively going to have

5736.639 --> 5741.04
an aids effect from it if you take the

5739.92 --> 5743.1990000000005
shot

5741.04 --> 5744.32
and that it's going to be well almost

5743.199 --> 5746.799999999999
impossible to

5744.32 --> 5747.599999999999
survive for longer than say 10 or 20

5746.8 --> 5749.1990000000005
years

5747.6 --> 5751.92
because after that point your body is

5749.199 --> 5755.678999999999
literally going to collapse in on itself

5751.92 --> 5756.0
like a timed self-destruct it might also

5755.679 --> 5760.639
turn

5756.0 --> 5763.28
out to be exactly that you know

5760.639 --> 5765.36
that oh it is not just a short term

5763.28 --> 5767.44
death and if you survive that oh

5765.36 --> 5768.96
you were maybe modified whatever blah

5767.44 --> 5771.28
blah you can live on

5768.96 --> 5773.679
or they could have pre-designed it that

5771.28 --> 5778.88
you will guaranteed

5773.679 --> 5781.92
to die after a certain period

5778.88 --> 5783.4400000000005
do you know have you looked into it do

5781.92 --> 5787.76
you know

5783.44 --> 5791.5199999999995
do you know what's gonna happen yeah

5787.76 --> 5791.52
yeah that's why i'm saying it's just

5792.0 --> 5798.0
it's a euthanization industry flu

5796.84 --> 5799.92
vaccine

5798.0 --> 5803.76
it's covered vaccine but flu vaccine

5799.92 --> 5807.04
it's a euthanization industry

5803.76 --> 5808.8
and they're just upping the game

5807.04 --> 5810.639
so you don't know what it's going to do

5808.8 --> 5812.0
to you you don't know if it's going to

5810.639 --> 5815.52
put you on a

5812.0 --> 5819.119
death timer if you survive

5815.52 --> 5821.679
the initial taking of it

5819.119 --> 5823.5199999999995
you don't know have you researched it

5821.679 --> 5824.0
before you go to the doctor stick it in

5823.52 --> 5826.4800000000005
your

5824.0 --> 5828.4
have you looked at what it does do you

5826.48 --> 5831.678999999999
know have you do you know

5828.4 --> 5834.638999999999
anybody professionals or not

5831.679 --> 5836.88
that even know what it does do you know

5834.639 --> 5838.88
or do you hurt somebody on the tv

5836.88 --> 5840.88
tell you it's all fine and you're gonna

5838.88 --> 5844.2390000000005
go with that

5840.88 --> 5855.84
is that good enough for you huh

5844.239 --> 5855.839999999999
poor sod

5860.32 --> 5864.799999999999
yeah tiny wumbo might be

5866.48 --> 5871.44
so yeah depending on how dramatic things

5869.92 --> 5873.52
will get

5871.44 --> 5875.04
because hey they might actually get to

5873.52 --> 5875.76
the point where they're literally going

5875.04 --> 5878.56
to try to

5875.76 --> 5879.119000000001
militarily quarantine and enforce it's

5878.56 --> 5882.159000000001
like oh

5879.119 --> 5884.639
this group is not taking the vaccine

5882.159 --> 5885.92
then we're going to siege them until

5884.639 --> 5889.6
they do

5885.92 --> 5892.159
maybe even kill them some of them

5889.6 --> 5893.04
but yeah like that the amish may

5892.159 --> 5896.08
literally be

5893.04 --> 5898.159
the eventual only survivors because

5896.08 --> 5900.239
everybody else is going to manipulate it

5898.159 --> 5900.96
and even militarily in force to take it

5900.239 --> 5902.959999999999
and they will

5900.96 --> 5904.88
just refuse no matter what they'd rather

5902.96 --> 5907.679
just be shot dead

5904.88 --> 5908.8
and some of them probably will but then

5907.679 --> 5911.84
they will

5908.8 --> 5913.28
be the last survivor surviving actual

5911.84 --> 5915.4400000000005
humans

5913.28 --> 5918.32
as everybody else is just going to be

5915.44 --> 5918.32
modified and

5922.84 --> 5925.84
dead

5927.76 --> 5931.76
but yes tiny bumble that that's the gist

5930.0 --> 5934.239
of it

5931.76 --> 5935.6
now again i don't know if it's a

5934.239 --> 5938.959999999999
guaranteed

5935.6 --> 5941.84
time to death that it will provide

5938.96 --> 5943.04
i'm just saying i wouldn't be excluding

5941.84 --> 5946.400000000001
it

5943.04 --> 5949.119
if you know what i mean seeing

5946.4 --> 5950.96
the people that are actually doing this

5949.119 --> 5953.119
what they want

5950.96 --> 5956.32
if it would be able to do that they'd

5953.119 --> 5956.32
probably like it

5963.44 --> 5969.119
do you think photo ops of world leaders

5965.679 --> 5972.159
getting vaccine shots are fake

5969.119 --> 5974.5599999999995
maybe or maybe they are

5972.159 --> 5975.44
literally doubling down satanists that

5974.56 --> 5979.119000000001
are like

5975.44 --> 5981.04
yeah we're gonna get so evil we're never

5979.119 --> 5982.5599999999995
going to make past the date we're not

5981.04 --> 5985.28
going to survive past the day

5982.56 --> 5985.679
because we're going to push so hard so

5985.28 --> 5988.639
far

5985.679 --> 5991.28
so much that we're guaranteed not to

5988.639 --> 5993.1990000000005
survive for that long

5991.28 --> 5994.48
that might also be you do not

5993.199 --> 5998.48
underestimate the

5994.48 --> 6000.959999999999
the religious zealotry of these insane

5998.48 --> 6003.199
grabblers

6000.96 --> 6005.199
they might actually taking it knowing

6003.199 --> 6008.48
they won't survive

6005.199 --> 6010.239
but they plan to push things so bad so

6008.48 --> 6012.799999999999
hard so far that they

6010.239 --> 6014.718999999999
know by their own calculations that

6012.8 --> 6016.4800000000005
they're never going to survive for that

6014.719 --> 6023.36
long

6016.48 --> 6026.08
might be that you don't know

6023.36 --> 6026.48
or yeah who's to know that it's just a

6026.08 --> 6028.5599999999995
prop

6026.48 --> 6030.159
it's not real it's just a salt water

6028.56 --> 6034.320000000001
solution yeah it could be

6030.159 --> 6036.0
could be or maybe they are doubling down

6034.32 --> 6038.799999999999
freaks you don't know

6036.0 --> 6038.8
time will tell

6040.159 --> 6046.159
and maybe the doctor that did it

6043.44 --> 6046.159
because they'll know

6048.719 --> 6053.52
it would be pretty cool though to just

6051.6 --> 6056.639
if there was an option at some point

6053.52 --> 6057.360000000001
it's like okay i need my saline water

6056.639 --> 6059.04
injection

6057.36 --> 6062.159
and then it's going to be stamped cove

6059.04 --> 6064.159
it who knows

6062.159 --> 6065.759999999999
or you are wrong oh you got some

6064.159 --> 6067.28
objection here because i need wombo you

6065.76 --> 6070.719
don't like it

6067.28 --> 6070.719
you don't like my tone here

6073.04 --> 6078.719
i'm just saying it is possible it's not

6076.84 --> 6083.28
guaranteed

6078.719 --> 6083.28
you know ever realize that maybe

6083.44 --> 6088.5599999999995
they discussed like i'm going to take

6086.639 --> 6090.88
the fake one

6088.56 --> 6091.679
and then they actually get the real one

6090.88 --> 6095.04
without them

6091.679 --> 6097.84
knowing you don't know

6095.04 --> 6098.56
how the [ __ ] this all works you don't

6097.84 --> 6101.679
know

6098.56 --> 6104.88
these people what they're into

6101.679 --> 6106.2390000000005
they're put on top of the pedestal like

6104.88 --> 6109.04
they're in control

6106.239 --> 6109.919999999999
are they really in control or is the

6109.04 --> 6113.28
conspiracy

6109.92 --> 6114.8
simply just using them as a distraction

6113.28 --> 6115.5199999999995
and they're not really that much in

6114.8 --> 6118.56
control

6115.52 --> 6120.320000000001
how do things really work for them are

6118.56 --> 6123.6
they completely

6120.32 --> 6125.92
in power or are there other influences

6123.6 --> 6127.4400000000005
that they have to subject themselves to

6125.92 --> 6130.88
because they cannot

6127.44 --> 6135.839999999999
do and otherwise you don't

6130.88 --> 6135.84
know tiny wumble

6148.639 --> 6152.8
right so how much can you trust your

6152.0 --> 6155.28
doctor

6152.8 --> 6155.84
you know with that sort of thing it's

6155.28 --> 6158.08
like if

6155.84 --> 6160.0
if there's gonna be a doctor that's like

6158.08 --> 6161.76
willing to fake inject you and have it

6160.0 --> 6166.4
officially on record

6161.76 --> 6166.400000000001
then that might be a good action but

6166.96 --> 6169.84
how would you know

6170.159 --> 6173.679
how would you know that he said those

6172.08 --> 6176.639
doctors secretly don't

6173.679 --> 6178.56
[ __ ] hate you and been looking

6176.639 --> 6180.2390000000005
forward to that opportunity to

6178.56 --> 6182.639
actually freaking inject you with the

6180.239 --> 6183.599999999999
real thing to [ __ ] you over as a revenge

6182.639 --> 6187.4400000000005
action

6183.6 --> 6189.679
yeah politicians how do you know

6187.44 --> 6192.799999999999
or maybe you just pay them a lot it's

6189.679 --> 6196.159
like pay them for your own

6192.8 --> 6198.400000000001
fraud security right well that might be

6196.159 --> 6200.159
cool but at the same time those people

6198.4 --> 6202.48
are also going to be looking at the

6200.159 --> 6204.08
world and how it is be slowly eroding

6202.48 --> 6205.599999999999
and being destroyed

6204.08 --> 6207.679
it's not a guarantee that they'll

6205.6 --> 6209.4400000000005
actually

6207.679 --> 6211.04
that they'll be okay with it they might

6209.44 --> 6214.4
have family that is

6211.04 --> 6218.639
dying because of this people they love

6214.4 --> 6220.159
dying because of this and so maybe

6218.639 --> 6221.679
some point they'll change your mind and

6220.159 --> 6224.5599999999995
actually like no

6221.679 --> 6226.2390000000005
no i'm actually going to just inject you

6224.56 --> 6228.2390000000005
with the real thing because i want you

6226.239 --> 6231.678999999999
to die as well

6228.239 --> 6232.4
because you you put this in you put this

6231.679 --> 6236.2390000000005
out there

6232.4 --> 6238.96
so you deserve it you don't know

6236.239 --> 6241.759999999999
yeah isn't that fun isn't it fun to be a

6238.96 --> 6243.36
grabbler isn't it fun to be in control

6241.76 --> 6246.2390000000005
and receive all that hate and

6243.36 --> 6261.839999999999
uncertainty i hope you drown and choke

6246.239 --> 6261.839999999999
in it

6295.38 --> 6298.569
[Music]

6299.119 --> 6303.28
nobody bothered about chemtrails anymore

6301.119 --> 6306.88
well

6303.28 --> 6309.36
yeah but do we really know what they

6306.88 --> 6312.32
really are

6309.36 --> 6313.199
no are they chem trails are they just

6312.32 --> 6315.36
basic water

6313.199 --> 6316.32
weather modification are they always

6315.36 --> 6319.36
toxic

6316.32 --> 6319.36
is it chemicals

6319.44 --> 6323.36
what are they using i'm pretty sure that

6321.44 --> 6324.638999999999
weather modification has been going on

6323.36 --> 6327.92
for

6324.639 --> 6331.119
yeah over two decades

6327.92 --> 6334.96
but is it chemical

6331.119 --> 6336.719
is it i don't know i get the feeling

6334.96 --> 6340.08
it's not over here

6336.719 --> 6342.4
it might be sometimes

6340.08 --> 6343.36
the [ __ ] with us i don't know spread

6342.4 --> 6346.719
something around

6343.36 --> 6350.159
create certain symptoms in order to push

6346.719 --> 6351.84
some agenda whatever but in general i

6350.159 --> 6353.5199999999995
don't think we're just constantly being

6351.84 --> 6355.6
sprayed by chemicals

6353.52 --> 6357.76
because you damn well know that you

6355.6 --> 6360.2390000000005
would know

6357.76 --> 6360.8
so symptoms building up more and more

6360.239 --> 6364.0
and more

6360.8 --> 6366.2390000000005
quickly very quickly eventually

6364.0 --> 6366.239
so

6367.04 --> 6372.159
i don't know but i know there is weather

6371.119 --> 6387.839999999999
modification

6372.159 --> 6387.839999999999
been admitted

6389.04 --> 6392.639
right gaining wisdom yeah you can't kill

6390.88 --> 6394.96
what's never been alive in the first

6392.639 --> 6394.96
place

6395.84 --> 6404.159000000001
you can't kill an inanimate object

6401.76 --> 6415.84
you could destroy it you can't kill it

6404.159 --> 6415.839999999999
because it was never alive

6433.199 --> 6437.599999999999
well see me traveler do you really need

6436.48 --> 6440.638999999999
to

6437.6 --> 6443.6
research why don't you just read

6440.639 --> 6445.28
the label of the vaccine why don't you

6443.6 --> 6448.88
read what's actually in there

6445.28 --> 6451.36
and then do research on those components

6448.88 --> 6452.8
just a google search will already help

6451.36 --> 6454.719
you

6452.8 --> 6457.28
pubmed there's a lot of medical

6454.719 --> 6459.76
information you can dig into

6457.28 --> 6461.5199999999995
that like medical professionals use

6459.76 --> 6464.2390000000005
pubmed

6461.52 --> 6464.2390000000005
it's fast

6467.28 --> 6471.36
like my absolute use use that as well

6470.159 --> 6474.719
it's very fascinating i

6471.36 --> 6476.5599999999995
it's too big for me though i think adam

6474.719 --> 6479.679
meekins also is very

6476.56 --> 6482.8
knowledgeable about pubmed as he is like

6479.679 --> 6482.8
involved with such things

6483.04 --> 6486.96
as a what is it pharmacist

6496.159 --> 6501.92
yeah just read what's in it

6499.28 --> 6504.5599999999995
and then do a research on just yeah what

6501.92 --> 6504.56
does that do

6504.639 --> 6508.0
and also it would be good to basically

6506.719 --> 6510.159
read up on

6508.0 --> 6512.159
vaccine theory where does it come from

6510.159 --> 6512.799999999999
what does it postulate what is actually

6512.159 --> 6516.4
happening

6512.8 --> 6518.08
how does it happen back in the past when

6516.4 --> 6521.28
it was originally

6518.08 --> 6524.5599999999995
experimented with and theorized and then

6521.28 --> 6527.44
medically proven how it works and then

6524.56 --> 6528.96
look at how things are done now what is

6527.44 --> 6531.599999999999
being used

6528.96 --> 6532.639
how has it evolved what's really

6531.6 --> 6537.92
happening and then just

6532.639 --> 6541.04
judge is this still what it even was

6537.92 --> 6544.56
what are they doing now and

6541.04 --> 6546.08
does it still conform to the original

6544.56 --> 6549.76
concept

6546.08 --> 6552.32
right because when you look

6549.76 --> 6553.599
like oh vaccine against the virus you're

6552.32 --> 6557.44
already

6553.599 --> 6560.32
it's already gone it's gone

6557.44 --> 6562.239
it's fiction at that point it's

6560.32 --> 6566.0
literally fiction because you can't

6562.239 --> 6568.159
vaccinate against an inanimate object

6566.0 --> 6570.88
and it's not gonna work because it's not

6568.159 --> 6570.879999999999
a cause

6571.119 --> 6576.32
viral agent the

6574.159 --> 6578.159
the little thingy that's supposed to

6576.32 --> 6582.32
represent the virus

6578.159 --> 6585.44
is not the cause of the symptoms

6582.32 --> 6588.08
of the disease it is the symptoms

6585.44 --> 6588.719
it's the effect it's the thing that

6588.08 --> 6592.08
happens

6588.719 --> 6594.159
in that process right so if you're going

6592.08 --> 6598.48
to vaccinate

6594.159 --> 6601.679
based on the original posters

6598.48 --> 6605.199
system with the bacteria and then

6601.679 --> 6611.599
applied with viruses you're immediately

6605.199 --> 6614.239
entering pseudoscience immediately

6611.599 --> 6615.84
yeah and i'm not as i'm not a medical

6614.239 --> 6619.5199999999995
professional like that

6615.84 --> 6619.52
but i know this is true

6620.639 --> 6627.119
through everything i've learned

6624.32 --> 6627.119
as a layman

6629.199 --> 6636.839999999999
so yeah vaccinations against viruses

6633.28 --> 6639.84
is pseudoscience and that's a

6636.84 --> 6653.84
fact vaccination against

6639.84 --> 6653.84
viruses is pseudoscience fact

6665.119 --> 6672.239
right and that doesn't mean that

6668.48 --> 6676.159
let's just say ailments or diseases

6672.239 --> 6679.04
it's hard to yeah colloquial diseases

6676.159 --> 6679.598999999999
that are associated with certain viruses

6679.04 --> 6681.92
that

6679.599 --> 6685.4400000000005
it doesn't mean that there is no

6681.92 --> 6685.4400000000005
solution to that whatsoever

6685.84 --> 6689.360000000001
the polio vaccine fake

6690.88 --> 6695.84
i've never researched too deep into it

6693.04 --> 6695.84
but

6697.52 --> 6701.76
i'm not even sure like what polio even

6699.52 --> 6701.76
is

6701.92 --> 6705.52
i know there's been a lot of issues with

6703.84 --> 6707.360000000001
it and i've heard even through alex

6705.52 --> 6709.679
jones like his

6707.36 --> 6711.04
mother or grandmother or something was

6709.679 --> 6712.88
vaccinated with it and she

6711.04 --> 6714.96
immediately got paralyzed because of the

6712.88 --> 6718.4800000000005
vaccination

6714.96 --> 6721.599
so i don't know i don't know about polio

6718.48 --> 6737.839999999999
it's never been like i never really dug

6721.599 --> 6737.84
into that deep feet

6750.8 --> 6754.56
oh by the way yeah see you later robin

6752.56 --> 6765.84
stanley thanks for being there

6754.56 --> 6765.84
it's good to have you in chat

6771.92 --> 6779.84
all right michael rock

6786.32 --> 6793.84
methyl mercury and ethylmerc it's

6790.84 --> 6793.84
mercury

6795.52 --> 6798.88
and by the way the mercury typically

6798.4 --> 6803.119
used

6798.88 --> 6807.84
in vaccinations these days is fimerosal

6803.119 --> 6807.839999999999
that's the form

6830.48 --> 6834.159
i mean i don't remember how that is like

6832.96 --> 6836.2390000000005
i know how to pronounce

6834.159 --> 6836.239
it

6841.04 --> 6849.84
oh yeah right right right

6844.719 --> 6849.84
this is how you spell it

6854.48 --> 6860.159
right so this is thimerosal back in the

6857.52 --> 6861.76
day with the flu vaccination and all

6860.159 --> 6865.679
that

6861.76 --> 6867.04
the the swine flu i was privy to dig

6865.679 --> 6870.4
into that and

6867.04 --> 6872.239
thimerosal was like a primary ingredient

6870.4 --> 6874.638999999999
it's the mercury form that's typically

6872.239 --> 6878.0
associated with flu related vaccines

6874.639 --> 6880.719
and it is very detrimental so

6878.0 --> 6883.36
when you are reading a vaccine in in

6880.719 --> 6888.4800000000005
inserts or what is it the

6883.36 --> 6888.48
yeah the insert right what's in it the

6889.119 --> 6892.48
the ingredient list look out for that

6891.84 --> 6895.4400000000005
word

6892.48 --> 6896.959999999999
that word means it's that's the mercury

6895.44 --> 6904.879999999999
type that's in there

6896.96 --> 6908.0
and it's very it is toxic it's not good

6904.88 --> 6910.32
right anyway i am rounding out the show

6908.0 --> 6910.32
very

6911.119 --> 6918.0
very medical related show

6914.8 --> 6920.4800000000005
not so much the subject

6918.0 --> 6922.48
that i used as a title cavendish proves

6920.48 --> 6924.638999999999
a low ring the bar plot twist

6922.48 --> 6925.839999999999
but hey it's kind of i just wanted to

6924.639 --> 6928.56

6925.84 --> 6930.719
word joke out there written down so

6928.56 --> 6932.639
