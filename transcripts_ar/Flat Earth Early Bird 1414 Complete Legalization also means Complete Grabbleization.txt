168.84 --> 174.44
hello LSG first in chat good to see you

174.959 --> 181.86
it is Sunday the 6th of November 2022

184.879 --> 188.959
and we're really on time today

189.3 --> 194.28
right

191.4 --> 197.81900000000002
so yeah I had a pretty intense day

194.28 --> 200.94
yesterday also because my friend from

197.819 --> 204.01899999999998
Neymar called me back

200.94 --> 204.019
since like

204.78 --> 208.98
three months

206.94 --> 213.07999999999998
and the last yeah I didn't know if she

208.98 --> 213.07999999999998
was ever gonna call back

213.959 --> 222.86
because she was like really like

217.5 --> 222.86
super angry and stressed out and

222.959 --> 228.54
last time so I was yeah really surprised

226.26 --> 230.879
to get her call and really happy about

228.54 --> 233.459
that we talked like

230.879 --> 236.35999999999999
four and a half hours

233.459 --> 236.36
over the phone

237.0 --> 241.86
and

239.28 --> 244.62
the story continues

241.86 --> 246.9
and it was very exhilarating because she

244.62 --> 248.09900000000002
is one of the few people that I can talk

246.9 --> 252.08
to

248.099 --> 254.819
on a pretty extremely high

252.08 --> 257.599
empathic level

254.819 --> 257.599
where

259.88 --> 264.959
I don't know it's it's complicated

265.02 --> 270.0
you just have a connection there I

267.0 --> 274.46
always had and it's been developing and

270.0 --> 274.46
we're like the only ones that

274.68 --> 280.08
yeah she's the only one that I know that

276.96 --> 282.9
I that I can't have like a

280.08 --> 285.53999999999996
really high level connection to unstable

282.9 --> 289.19899999999996
in a stable way

285.54 --> 290.88
that it doesn't just become a part of

289.199 --> 293.639
our relationship but that is kind of

290.88 --> 295.8
exclusively our relationship

293.639 --> 298.28000000000003
it's like a you could call it a wizard

295.8 --> 298.28000000000003
friendship

298.5 --> 301.16
uh

301.38 --> 305.82
but uh yeah it was really kind of

303.6 --> 307.68
relieved about that and at the same time

305.82 --> 311.78
it's like yeah it's pretty heavy

307.68 --> 311.78000000000003
everything with her is pretty heavy

312.78 --> 321.0
and she always draws out more of my like

317.52 --> 323.52
flashback type thinking and considering

321.0 --> 326.4
dreaming and what that is and with kids

323.52 --> 328.38
because she's always like really she has

326.4 --> 331.44
a very young kid now

328.38 --> 334.44
little girl she's like five

331.44 --> 336.6
and she is

334.44 --> 340.259
like well

336.6 --> 342.24
extremely brilliant but that likes

340.259 --> 344.28000000000003
that's like dangerous because at the

342.24 --> 346.02
same time like her surroundings the

344.28 --> 349.13899999999995
people that

346.02 --> 350.639
uh her father is like basically a

349.139 --> 355.139
psychopath

350.639 --> 358.38
and it's really creepy sometimes

355.139 --> 360.919
like it's pretty the entire situation of

358.38 --> 363.9
her my friend's life is pretty

360.919 --> 365.28
miraculous that it even seems to be

363.9 --> 368.52
working

365.28 --> 372.539
sometimes but there's no yeah

368.52 --> 375.59999999999997
that's always been like that and I yeah

372.539 --> 378.71999999999997
I just try to give her more

375.6 --> 381.3
grip on everything and

378.72 --> 384.53900000000004
just try to ensure that she doesn't have

381.3 --> 386.759
to worry so much about

384.539 --> 390.71999999999997
hectic situation yeah and about

386.759 --> 393.06
hecticness of situations in general and

390.72 --> 396.06
like reminding her like no you have to

393.06 --> 398.819
trust God you have to just trust

396.06 --> 402.24
that your effort's gonna be met by God

398.819 --> 403.97900000000004
even if in the moment itself it seems

402.24 --> 407.52
like everything is turning against you

403.979 --> 408.84
on a like neurotic level even and so

407.52 --> 411.78
yeah

408.84 --> 414.84
we talk pretty intensely

411.78 --> 418.46
four and a half hours but it was good

414.84 --> 418.46
I was really glad to

418.86 --> 424.52000000000004
well to feel that I hadn't been

421.86 --> 424.52000000000004
abandoned

424.919 --> 431.88
by like my last

428.699 --> 435.38
friend that I really know face to face

431.88 --> 435.38
from my country

437.06 --> 441.96
[Music]

439.56 --> 444.96
because the last time I was kind of like

441.96 --> 448.02
being very strict with her in a moment

444.96 --> 450.479
where she was weak and basically like oh

448.02 --> 453.599
I'm trying to get out of it and I

450.479 --> 455.21999999999997
basically then kind of you yeah got very

453.599 --> 456.36
strict with her which is extremely

455.22 --> 459.36
painful

456.36 --> 461.039
like basically reminding her look this

459.36 --> 462.41900000000004
is what you do every time this is what

461.039 --> 465.36
you're now going to do this is what you

462.419 --> 469.28
don't want to do don't you and it's

465.36 --> 469.28000000000003
and that kind of blew our mind

471.539 --> 476.46
but at the same time she was kind of

473.759 --> 479.539
overburdened so that was a risky move

476.46 --> 479.539
that I made at the time

480.18 --> 486.599
and she basically started saying like I

483.479 --> 488.88
like no you're a psychopath

486.599 --> 492.0
like something like that and that was

488.88 --> 493.27
like whoa uh

492.0 --> 494.639
okay

493.27 --> 497.039
[Music]

494.639 --> 500.34000000000003
and yeah she just started to basically

497.039 --> 502.979
get to like screaming face and I just

500.34 --> 504.23999999999995
said like stop you're acting out on me

502.979 --> 506.639
and

504.24 --> 509.94
I hung up because I was

506.639 --> 512.399
actually a bit stressed out in that time

509.94 --> 515.099
myself but that doesn't really usually

512.399 --> 518.099
block me from being able to just counsel

515.099 --> 520.44
her even if I'm weak I'll still be able

518.099 --> 523.2
to do that because we kind of like

520.44 --> 525.24
borrow each other's Energies

523.2 --> 529.38
so it works

525.24 --> 531.839
always and we yeah I know but yeah that

529.38 --> 533.76
was like an explosive last

531.839 --> 536.0400000000001
phone call

533.76 --> 538.98
and so to just get that phone call back

536.04 --> 540.54
yesterday was like a real relief

538.98 --> 543.0
because I didn't know if she was ever

540.54 --> 546.14
gonna call back

543.0 --> 546.14
right so

547.2 --> 550.519
it was yesterday evening

550.8 --> 557.5999999999999
hello tarot 306 good to see you Neil

553.92 --> 557.5999999999999
Cosentino's Susie s

558.839 --> 561.9200000000001
are you all doing

562.71 --> 566.08
[Music]

571.44 --> 577.62
yeah my show yesterday was something

574.08 --> 579.779
else I watched like half of it back

577.62 --> 581.519
it's really weird to like have a show

579.779 --> 584.399
where I'm just completely basically

581.519 --> 586.62
talking about drugs because I well I've

584.399 --> 588.839
been kind of more and more trying to

586.62 --> 591.12
avoid that in general but

588.839 --> 594.08
it was still

591.12 --> 594.08
interesting

595.92 --> 600.5
not going to make a habit of that

597.959 --> 600.5
right away

601.019 --> 605.16
because yeah

602.76 --> 608.16
it does kind of

605.16 --> 612.26
stimulate people to go there and that's

608.16 --> 612.26
not what I'm supposed to be doing

612.899 --> 617.519
like and even if I then say like at

615.3 --> 621.26
certain points like don't do this or

617.519 --> 624.3
whatever the problem is if the

621.26 --> 626.64
surrounding that is moment where I am

624.3 --> 628.74
basically like really zoned in and

626.64 --> 631.62
explaining like

628.74 --> 633.899
Spirit mechanical details of experiences

631.62 --> 636.72
even relating to drugs the problem is

633.899 --> 637.74
that even if I give harsh warnings in

636.72 --> 641.839
between

637.74 --> 641.839
that usually doesn't work then

642.839 --> 647.0400000000001
if somebody's like already kind of

645.18 --> 648.18
getting attracted to it

647.04 --> 650.64
so

648.18 --> 652.8
I hope I didn't accidentally yesterday

650.64 --> 655.86
put a whole bunch of people back on

652.8 --> 658.38
drugs I really did not mean to if so I'm

655.86 --> 659.88
really sorry

658.38 --> 663.12
but

659.88 --> 667.76
if not then I hope you just learned

663.12 --> 667.76
something about it about what it is like

668.459 --> 672.54
and for people that have already gotten

670.56 --> 674.6999999999999
into it that you're not always

672.54 --> 678.62
necessarily doomed

674.7 --> 678.62
but it is pretty tough road

680.04 --> 686.88
even if you get out of it anyway uh

683.76 --> 688.98
yeah the time has also been reset

686.88 --> 694.3389999999999
in the United States so it's kind of

688.98 --> 694.339
back on uh back parallel with Europe

694.68 --> 697.68
foreign

698.579 --> 701.579
savings

702.36 --> 705.14
all right

705.72 --> 712.0400000000001
well Susie s is the time also reset in

709.32 --> 712.0400000000001
Australia now

712.14 --> 717.0
I'm not sure maybe you guys have it at

714.899 --> 719.3
another time even or or not at all I

717.0 --> 719.3
don't know

719.519 --> 727.38
but Europe had like put the clock

724.38 --> 727.38
uh

727.8 --> 731.42
was it an hour forward

732.42 --> 737.279
no an hour backward

734.88 --> 739.86
a week ago and the United States should

737.279 --> 743.64
be doing that today

739.86 --> 746.7
I don't know a month ago

743.64 --> 749.6999999999999
oh wait what Australia's reset a month

746.7 --> 752.0
ago so Australia is basically doing that

749.7 --> 752.0
first

753.24 --> 756.6
huh

754.92 --> 760.4399999999999
I didn't know that

756.6 --> 764.519
so first Australia does it

760.44 --> 766.72
and then Europe and then America

764.519 --> 770.16
okay

766.72 --> 772.44
[Music]

770.16 --> 774.12
I don't know why the the two weeks in

772.44 --> 776.1600000000001
between now

774.12 --> 777.899
that's weird why why not just all do it

776.16 --> 780.38
at the same time but

777.899 --> 780.38
well

780.779 --> 782.779
um

783.13 --> 788.639
[Music]

785.94 --> 791.1600000000001
correct hey fiber oats

788.639 --> 793.0790000000001
hey thanks for the PayPal donation

791.16 --> 795.77
like after the show yesterday I really

793.079 --> 799.0
appreciated that

795.77 --> 799.0
[Music]

810.92 --> 816.0
right it was funny yesterday also

813.42 --> 819.24
talking a bit about like

816.0 --> 823.26
the issues with like policies concerning

819.24 --> 825.54
cannabis and dangers of legalization

823.26 --> 827.519
and it had a different title yesterday

825.54 --> 829.38
but I thought that this was like a

827.519 --> 831.12
worthy thing that I said to make a new

829.38 --> 832.2
title don't know if I want to talk about

831.12 --> 834.72
it

832.2 --> 837.0
but it would also reference to pretty

834.72 --> 839.519
much anything not just oh drugs or

837.0 --> 842.23
whatever right complete legalization

839.519 --> 845.33
also means complete grabbalization

842.23 --> 845.33
[Music]

849.66 --> 852.1999999999999
anyway

854.1 --> 858.9590000000001
it doesn't have to be the subject for

855.959 --> 861.06
today but I still thought it was a title

858.959 --> 863.459
worth

861.06 --> 865.68
putting in there

863.459 --> 868.3389999999999
anyway what are you guys talking about

865.68 --> 868.3389999999999
uh

880.61 --> 887.519
[Music]

883.88 --> 889.86
yeah Neo makes sense I mean I do kind of

887.519 --> 891.48
always tend to Jumble it up a bit and

889.86 --> 892.6800000000001
then unsure like is it forward or

891.48 --> 895.5
backward

892.68 --> 897.66
but it just generally makes more sense

895.5 --> 902.1
to put the clock

897.66 --> 905.2199999999999
forward in the spring when the sun gets

902.1 --> 907.639
up earlier so you get more of that early

905.22 --> 907.639
Sun

907.86 --> 913.5
or more later afterward after you're

911.279 --> 915.24
done with work that you'll still have a

913.5 --> 916.92
plenty of Sun

915.24 --> 918.899
and then

916.92 --> 922.139
during the fall

918.899 --> 924.36
because the sun then goes up later

922.139 --> 926.699
that you

924.36 --> 929.399
get up a little later too

926.699 --> 931.8199999999999
because the sun goes down or even

929.399 --> 931.82
earlier

935.519 --> 938.04
anyways

936.839 --> 939.839
like that

938.04 --> 942.8
right

939.839 --> 942.8000000000001
hello Bundy bear

946.199 --> 951.8389999999999
right yeah something weird by the way

948.48 --> 954.3000000000001
with the Scott remember Scott

951.839 --> 956.4590000000001
it's been hanging around for a while

954.3 --> 959.8199999999999
and yesterday he got all weird on me

956.459 --> 962.579
basically started to talk to me like

959.82 --> 966.36
like I was a drug addict

962.579 --> 968.6389999999999
and I banned him for it well afterward I

966.36 --> 971.519
said I was going to unban him today but

968.639 --> 973.62
yeah I can't find him back

971.519 --> 976.1
it seems like his account has just been

973.62 --> 976.1
deleted

976.86 --> 982.5600000000001
that was word that was like really weird

980.22 --> 984.779
so it could be that something went

982.56 --> 986.3389999999999
really wrong I is a account might have

984.779 --> 989.12
been hacked or something

986.339 --> 989.12
or

989.22 --> 993.1800000000001
I don't know who he was it could have

991.019 --> 995.579
been like a young kid that did it like

993.18 --> 997.2589999999999
on his laptop and then some kid just

995.579 --> 999.54
like

997.259 --> 1002.3000000000001
deleted it or something

999.54 --> 1006.16
at school or what I don't know

1002.3 --> 1006.16
but it's gone so that was weird

1007.279 --> 1010.9399999999999
yeah

1008.899 --> 1014.42
by the way it's not the first time

1010.94 --> 1016.6990000000001
something like that has happened

1014.42 --> 1019.519
with people that were wrenched up in my

1016.699 --> 1022.3599999999999
chat this is like the fourth time in the

1019.519 --> 1022.36
last four years

1023.06 --> 1027.1989999999998
somebody that they just knew always

1025.04 --> 1029.6
super friendly like for a long time

1027.199 --> 1032.66
going through the even through the rage

1029.6 --> 1034.6989999999998
and through the week times being very

1032.66 --> 1036.559
gracious and then all of a sudden they

1034.699 --> 1038.72
start to act like like a completely

1036.559 --> 1041.839
different person

1038.72 --> 1046.6000000000001
and then well more than often suddenly

1041.839 --> 1046.6
their accountant disappears that's weird

1051.74 --> 1057.82
what tried acting into your credit card

1055.039 --> 1057.82
hmm

1059.48 --> 1064.66
or your card yeah that's not good

1071.83 --> 1074.98
[Music]

1077.03 --> 1081.5
[Music]

1079.4 --> 1083.7800000000002
that that's weird by the way because

1081.5 --> 1087.08
some time ago

1083.78 --> 1090.08
my credit card also there was a hack at

1087.08 --> 1092.86
them but yeah I was immediately notified

1090.08 --> 1092.86
by my bank

1093.98 --> 1099.2
and so yeah it was refreshed but that

1097.82 --> 1101.48
looks like the first time that that's

1099.2 --> 1105.32
ever happened to me so I think there's

1101.48 --> 1107.72
like some Weird thingy going on

1105.32 --> 1110.059
out there there might be sort of like

1107.72 --> 1112.82
Financial cyber

1110.059 --> 1114.34
crime increase for some reason there's

1112.82 --> 1117.55
something going on

1114.34 --> 1117.55
[Music]

1119.84 --> 1127.1599999999999
it might be like a controlled unleash

1124.16 --> 1129.559
to to put more pressure on the financial

1127.16 --> 1131.059
system because you know by now you

1129.559 --> 1133.8799999999999
should know that

1131.059 --> 1137.24
the New World Order

1133.88 --> 1141.3200000000002
is trying to basically yeah reset

1137.24 --> 1142.58
Financial systems including in Europe

1141.32 --> 1146.84
so

1142.58 --> 1150.28
that might be basically yeah on purpose

1146.84 --> 1150.28
that they're just like okay

1151.66 --> 1159.14
like let them let them try it out let

1155.539 --> 1161.26
them [ __ ] it up for people so that

1159.14 --> 1165.5590000000002
people get restless and lose confidence

1161.26 --> 1166.96
and then by be more inclined to be Pro

1165.559 --> 1170.96
or new

1166.96 --> 1173.98
crypto banking system or whatever it's

1170.96 --> 1173.98
gonna be you know

1175.22 --> 1182.679
I mean do not underestimate how these

1178.28 --> 1182.6789999999999
politicians do do what they do

1182.84 --> 1189.1399999999999
I mean they've already proven that

1185.059 --> 1193.12
they're very very willing to just have

1189.14 --> 1193.1200000000001
millions of people killed

1193.76 --> 1199.34
through complete lies so

1196.82 --> 1203.0
yeah why would you think that they

1199.34 --> 1207.02
wouldn't send send out hackers

1203.0 --> 1210.94
or like have blackmail deals with cyber

1207.02 --> 1213.86
criminals and like yeah

1210.94 --> 1217.46
banking criminals whatever and then just

1213.86 --> 1221.12
say like oh yeah well you know what

1217.46 --> 1224.48
why don't you go attack

1221.12 --> 1227.7199999999998
this country like all the banks or this

1224.48 --> 1229.039
bank or these groups of people just do

1227.72 --> 1230.539
your thing

1229.039 --> 1233.24
and then they're not going to be

1230.539 --> 1235.46
basically traced by the Secret Service

1233.24 --> 1237.679
or they'll track them but not do

1235.46 --> 1239.48
anything about it right because of a

1237.679 --> 1242.25
political maneuver

1239.48 --> 1244.94
this [ __ ] happens

1242.25 --> 1248.179
[Music]

1244.94 --> 1251.0
because I think technically

1248.179 --> 1253.64
it's like a real secret service system

1251.0 --> 1255.32
that is very cyber oriented

1253.64 --> 1258.74
and competent

1255.32 --> 1261.02
if that was there

1258.74 --> 1264.08
and not like

1261.02 --> 1265.58
uh be yeah unusable for political

1264.08 --> 1267.32
maneuvering

1265.58 --> 1269.72
then I don't think that like anything

1267.32 --> 1273.1399999999999
would ever even happen I think that all

1269.72 --> 1275.179
these type of the heck Wanna Be yeah

1273.14 --> 1279.39
these hackers and

1275.179 --> 1282.749
they would all get caught very quickly

1279.39 --> 1282.749
[Music]

1284.78 --> 1292.299
so it almost feels like sort of a bit of

1288.679 --> 1295.22
a weird Universal Mafia

1292.299 --> 1297.86
situation where it's like yeah we're the

1295.22 --> 1300.8600000000001
only ones that can actually stop it

1297.86 --> 1302.78
but we're not going to completely stop

1300.86 --> 1304.52
it because then

1302.78 --> 1309.74
people are

1304.52 --> 1311.96
like gonna forget that that even exists

1309.74 --> 1314.6200000000001
and then they might think that we're

1311.96 --> 1314.6200000000001
pointless

1315.2 --> 1320.9
right it's this very typical Mafia

1318.32 --> 1322.46
strategy and it is about a monopoly on a

1320.9 --> 1324.02
certain type of power well yeah secret

1322.46 --> 1327.159
surfaces that

1324.02 --> 1330.52
go after cyber crime and financial

1327.159 --> 1333.0200000000002
hacking crimes they have a certain

1330.52 --> 1334.6399999999999
monopolistic power compared to everybody

1333.02 --> 1336.74
else

1334.64 --> 1338.96
because they can dig in things that

1336.74 --> 1340.82
nobody is ever allowed to do right

1338.96 --> 1342.559
because then you immediately get on

1340.82 --> 1347.6589999999999
their list

1342.559 --> 1350.6
so they have that sort of power Monopoly

1347.659 --> 1352.8200000000002
depending them how that's dealt with in

1350.6 --> 1355.7199999999998
a country with laws and all that

1352.82 --> 1355.72
they could

1355.94 --> 1362.1200000000001
be well bought out usually then by

1360.44 --> 1364.4
government I'd say

1362.12 --> 1367.1
to just like go along with political

1364.4 --> 1370.1000000000001
schemes like the oh yeah we're gonna do

1367.1 --> 1372.32
this maneuver now we're gonna roll out

1370.1 --> 1373.6999999999998
this speech and then roll out these

1372.32 --> 1378.5
policies

1373.7 --> 1381.74
and then yeah get very hard on this

1378.5 --> 1383.96
specific type these words if people

1381.74 --> 1386.539
have these words then go after them

1383.96 --> 1389.24
right now not before that of course and

1386.539 --> 1391.58
after but in this moment I mean hasn't

1389.24 --> 1395.1200000000001
that effectively already been going on I

1391.58 --> 1397.9399999999998
mean we attributed mostly to

1395.12 --> 1400.1
like the companies like oh it's YouTube

1397.94 --> 1403.5800000000002
It's Twitter

1400.1 --> 1406.6999999999998
but is it like is it really like the

1403.58 --> 1409.28
guys it like at Twitter

1406.7 --> 1411.44
that is doing that or are they just like

1409.28 --> 1414.2
following orders and they're actually

1411.44 --> 1416.9
being given all kinds of

1414.2 --> 1419.659
more political oriented commands and

1416.9 --> 1422.419
[ __ ] and and they just

1419.659 --> 1424.7
don't yeah they just they just do what

1422.419 --> 1428.679
they're told they don't even know

1424.7 --> 1428.679
anymore what what's going on

1431.9 --> 1438.679
right it's so complicated now and people

1436.039 --> 1441.559
that talk about this and they're not

1438.679 --> 1444.02
super intricately informed and know the

1441.559 --> 1447.32
individuals and the power people in

1444.02 --> 1452.539
power places official functions

1447.32 --> 1455.48
yeah it's very tough it's like is it

1452.539 --> 1458.059
like for example is it Bezos right is it

1455.48 --> 1459.799
that big guy on that giant company is it

1458.059 --> 1464.8999999999999
all him

1459.799 --> 1467.72
or is it the CIA the spooky

1464.9 --> 1471.14
behind the scene guys that are are bound

1467.72 --> 1474.08
by supposed laws but then again it's

1471.14 --> 1476.9
it's all kind of shady anyway and get

1474.08 --> 1481.1589999999999
caught in crime situations and

1476.9 --> 1483.2
is it them right well you don't really

1481.159 --> 1486.919
know yes

1483.2 --> 1490.0
until you start to figure out what is

1486.919 --> 1490.0
actually going on

1490.52 --> 1494.72
how what is happening how is this being

1493.28 --> 1497.539
maneuvered you have to be able to

1494.72 --> 1501.34
Envision and I could think that

1497.539 --> 1501.34
Secret Service people

1501.44 --> 1508.179
some of them might be connected to

1505.22 --> 1508.179
political groups

1508.94 --> 1514.22
and yeah that's been going on for a

1511.46 --> 1517.039
while and they just like regular crime

1514.22 --> 1519.34
investigating secret Services can just

1517.039 --> 1519.34
like

1519.679 --> 1525.5590000000002
get into a company all of a sudden say

1522.44 --> 1528.6200000000001
like uh yeah National Security sort of

1525.559 --> 1530.36
like that right say like yeah uh you

1528.62 --> 1532.1
wouldn't have you have to do this and

1530.36 --> 1535.4599999999998
that and that now

1532.1 --> 1539.48
for for this specific period and you'll

1535.46 --> 1540.679
be compensated financially of course

1539.48 --> 1543.2
right

1540.679 --> 1545.179
I think that [ __ ] goes on

1543.2 --> 1548.1200000000001
and it's just become extremely

1545.179 --> 1549.88
convoluted and effectively corrupted

1548.12 --> 1552.26
because of this because there's like

1549.88 --> 1555.2600000000002
connections that shouldn't be there like

1552.26 --> 1557.779
through between the politics and the

1555.26 --> 1559.22
secret services and then through that

1557.779 --> 1561.799
same connection through the secret

1559.22 --> 1563.419
surfaces in the social media so I think

1561.799 --> 1565.779
there's like this direct connection

1563.419 --> 1568.88
because of

1565.779 --> 1571.419
that situation that's one of my

1568.88 --> 1571.419
suspicions

1573.02 --> 1577.1589999999999
right and then who do you blame you know

1574.88 --> 1578.8400000000001
who do you blame well you you definitely

1577.159 --> 1581.2990000000002
should blame

1578.84 --> 1585.1999999999998
Secret Service people that have been

1581.299 --> 1587.779
well politically corrupted because that

1585.2 --> 1590.0800000000002
think that is kind of illegal in most

1587.779 --> 1590.08
places

1592.039 --> 1598.039
right but for example with the CIA you

1596.0 --> 1599.6
would expect that because that's kind of

1598.039 --> 1602.12
their

1599.6 --> 1604.58
their designation is like they can't

1602.12 --> 1606.1589999999999
supposedly act in their own country but

1604.58 --> 1611.0
they can like

1606.159 --> 1615.3400000000001
undermine Authority or culture

1611.0 --> 1615.34
or even sabotage in other places

1615.919 --> 1622.279
right so that's like a hostile

1618.919 --> 1625.659
Secret Service and they can

1622.279 --> 1625.659
buy their way in

1625.82 --> 1632.0
with politicians that are like already

1629.12 --> 1635.059
kind of marxist and all that right

1632.0 --> 1637.82
that's it think about how it all

1635.059 --> 1641.12
actually clicks together and then starts

1637.82 --> 1642.62
to form these functions and these ways

1641.12 --> 1644.799
of doing things

1642.62 --> 1647.4399999999998
anyway

1644.799 --> 1649.76
thinking about that

1647.44 --> 1651.799
[Music]

1649.76 --> 1653.419
hope I hope you guys can follow what I'm

1651.799 --> 1655.92
talking about it is getting a bit

1653.419 --> 1659.3590000000002
esoteric

1655.92 --> 1659.3590000000002
[Music]

1664.76 --> 1668.74
right but look

1669.44 --> 1673.8200000000002
and this is interesting because there's

1671.24 --> 1675.919
also been criticism like the FBI for

1673.82 --> 1678.74
example which is basically like the

1675.919 --> 1681.5590000000002
Secret Service in the country

1678.74 --> 1684.44
but it's also so widely known that the

1681.559 --> 1686.44
FBI has been extremely prone

1684.44 --> 1688.24
to

1686.44 --> 1691.3400000000001
political

1688.24 --> 1695.6
maneuvering like they're also almost

1691.34 --> 1698.6
doubling as actors for political parties

1695.6 --> 1701.539
and that's a big problem right that's

1698.6 --> 1703.2199999999998
the biggest problem probably

1701.539 --> 1706.779
if that could be

1703.22 --> 1706.779
completely prevented

1706.88 --> 1715.64
and there's a great likelihood that also

1711.38 --> 1715.64
there will be less like

1715.72 --> 1722.0
invasive secret surface politicization

1720.02 --> 1723.62
that they're just gonna go after people

1722.0 --> 1726.5
and

1723.62 --> 1727.58
yeah hack their accounts or set them up

1726.5 --> 1731.179
or

1727.58 --> 1733.72
just blackball them everywhere

1731.179 --> 1733.72
right

1733.81 --> 1739.009
[Music]

1742.76 --> 1749.2

1745.94 --> 1749.2

I mean is that what's so strange about

1887.96 --> 1890.32
that

1890.659 --> 1894.159
sounds kind of practical

1898.88 --> 1904.5100000000002
yeah I was just gonna say

1902.12 --> 1907.819
sounds pretty handy

I want the one by sunlight

1942.2 --> 1945.2
ah

1952.039 --> 1957.1589999999999
man I added some really intense dreaming

1954.98 --> 1957.159
today

1958.64 --> 1962.6000000000001
or this tonight

1960.44 --> 1964.52
was interesting

1962.6 --> 1965.779
I think I've been like dreaming

1964.52 --> 1968.299
Minecraft

1965.779 --> 1971.26
this is weird it's because watching

1968.299 --> 1971.26
Nathan playing

1980.36 --> 1985.8799999999999
I mean like the blockish nature of it is

1983.539 --> 1987.799
very appealing in a way it kind of maybe

1985.88 --> 1989.179
triggers the same thing that Lego

1987.799 --> 1991.52
triggers

1989.179 --> 1994.7
with me

1991.52 --> 1994.7

I've been watching Owen Benjamin

2064.359 --> 2067.379

2106.32 --> 2109.92
Let's uh

2115.359 --> 2120.52
yeah yeah the rest there was like flat

2118.9 --> 2123.4
side stream but that's like when my

2120.52 --> 2125.079
friend from Nema started calling

2123.4 --> 2127.8
and I pretty much missed everything

2125.079 --> 2127.8
after that

2128.14 --> 2131.16
all the screams

2133.72 --> 2138.339
I mean we did talk like four and a half

2135.7 --> 2140.52
hours so

2138.339 --> 2140.52
foreign

2171.78 --> 2176.079
almost saying interesting political

2174.339 --> 2179.04
situations in the Netherlands where

2176.079 --> 2179.04
there's like real

2179.859 --> 2186.839
real push I think

2182.44 --> 2186.839
to get these this government out

2191.8 --> 2197.3390000000004
like it's heating up

2193.72 --> 2200.98
I we'll see if it if it actually

2197.339 --> 2204.839
accomplishes it what yeah what we all

2200.98 --> 2204.839
want but uh

2205.18 --> 2208.7799999999997
that's also happening I mean I'm not

2207.28 --> 2211.92
gonna go in too much detail because

2208.78 --> 2211.92
that's just gonna be boring

2212.02 --> 2214.74
uh

2224.88 --> 2229.26
that's my first question what

2247.8 --> 2253.3
yes yeah that's part of the stories if

2250.9 --> 2256.98
you just see that even Michael Khan

2253.3 --> 2256.98
uploaded a video of that

2276.579 --> 2283.1400000000003
oh wait no I mean Mr Cheswick

2279.28 --> 2283.1400000000003
he's the one that had that video

2285.54 --> 2288.65
[Music]

2290.92 --> 2297.66
what

2292.68 --> 2297.66
syncretism Society what what

2313.0 --> 2318.099
yeah did you see that and there's a

2315.16 --> 2320.859
whole bunch of weird cackling

2318.099 --> 2325.1400000000003
about David I going around now

2320.859 --> 2325.14
like a whole bunch of triggered people

2326.02 --> 2333.78
that are getting like oh anti-semitism

2329.74 --> 2333.7799999999997
serious it's pretty weird

2347.63 --> 2350.86
[Music]

2351.78 --> 2359.8
uh like maybe I'll give one example

2356.079 --> 2364.0600000000004
because it was just so silly

2359.8 --> 2366.28
it's like rata called David Ike

2364.06 --> 2369.5789999999997
anti-Semitic

2366.28 --> 2371.079
think he probably has I don't even know

2369.579 --> 2374.44
because I don't like all follow

2371.079 --> 2377.32
everything he says but

2374.44 --> 2379.06
then somebody else pointed out the

2377.32 --> 2381.6400000000003
little digging and

2379.06 --> 2385.359
figured out that

2381.64 --> 2387.7599999999998
in the uni in some United Nations vote

2385.359 --> 2389.5
the Netherlands which is basically the

2387.76 --> 2393.3390000000004
rata government

2389.5 --> 2395.619
actually voted against making Nazism

2393.339 --> 2399.339
completely illegal

2395.619 --> 2401.56
it's like okay I mean it's just some

2399.339 --> 2404.5
stupid new United Nations thing but

2401.56 --> 2405.82
still that is kind of like right and

2404.5 --> 2408.839
you're gonna call

2405.82 --> 2413.44
David hike

2408.839 --> 2416.98
a Nazi but you're gonna vote against the

2413.44 --> 2419.32
complete abolishing of all Nazism all

2416.98 --> 2423.64
right sure

2419.32 --> 2425.56
that makes sense it does however confirm

2423.64 --> 2428.16
what I've been saying for a while and

2425.56 --> 2428.16
that is that

2428.26 --> 2437.079
people that accuse others of

2431.8 --> 2439.0
anti-Semitism are usually anti-semites

2437.079 --> 2439.96
because that's a real Marxist thing to

2439.0 --> 2445.43
do

2439.96 --> 2445.43
[Music]

2449.38 --> 2454.06
you could almost you could almost reason

2452.38 --> 2456.04
out don't know if there's some real

2454.06 --> 2459.22
solidity to it that they might be almost

2456.04 --> 2464.88
like virtual signaling

2459.22 --> 2464.8799999999997
that's like pro-nazism because

2465.66 --> 2470.98
they oppose them

2468.4 --> 2473.32
but then they help them it's just Total

2470.98 --> 2476.5

2473.32 --> 2479.56
these these Marxist people empower the

2476.5 --> 2481.48
Waf agenda people they are completely

2479.56 --> 2483.46
insane

2481.48 --> 2485.14
they're in the Reversed world and they

2483.46 --> 2486.7
really are that it's not it's like it's

2485.14 --> 2489.46
not an act

2486.7 --> 2493.56
they're they're stuck

everything is inside out for them

[Music]

2503.56 --> 2508.24
I mean you could almost say at this

2506.2 --> 2510.54
point like yeah they are the Nazis and

2508.24 --> 2513.339
they're Nazis

2510.54 --> 2515.98
constantly shaming people for being

2513.339 --> 2519.839
anti-semitic I mean

2515.98 --> 2519.839

2527.14 --> 2538.1299999999997
[Music]

2547.9 --> 2552.099
it gets even weirder of course when you

2550.119 --> 2554.26
start to dig into what actually happened

2552.099 --> 2557.6800000000003
in World War II and that

2554.26 --> 2561.82
yeah might actually be

2557.68 --> 2566.6189999999997
certain group of certain specific

2561.82 --> 2570.52
riddles yeah proclaimed religious group

2566.619 --> 2573.099
that actually directed most of that

2570.52 --> 2576.94
well I suspect

2573.099 --> 2579.099
that the actual Hitler even

2576.94 --> 2582.88
at that point

2579.099 --> 2586.1800000000003
like Tapped Out went to Argentina

2582.88 --> 2590.319
well yeah that specific religious group

2586.18 --> 2592.9199999999996
actually was directing the Nazi war like

2590.319 --> 2592.92
they were

2593.68 --> 2600.96
foreign

2595.619 --> 2600.96
of the war class variety you could say

2603.28 --> 2611.1400000000003
but yeah it's also convoluted

2607.93 --> 2611.14
[Music]

2613.839 --> 2618.22
so yeah

2615.819 --> 2620.319
maybe it's just maybe the whole thing is

2618.22 --> 2623.3799999999997
has kind of always been Marxist or

2620.319 --> 2625.839
became that right it started Germany

2623.38 --> 2628.54
like a Grassroots would take care kind

2625.839 --> 2630.22
of Christian be for the family be

2628.54 --> 2633.9
healthy

2630.22 --> 2633.8999999999996
reject lies

2634.72 --> 2639.0989999999997
right

2636.22 --> 2641.02
certain group of people then with their

2639.099 --> 2643.54
habits become a little bit more

2641.02 --> 2645.16
unpopular perhaps but they were still

2643.54 --> 2647.74
there and they were still they were

2645.16 --> 2650.2
there all throughout

2647.74 --> 2654.1189999999997
the whole Nazi Germany time even in

2650.2 --> 2654.1189999999997
literal positions of power so

2661.96 --> 2667.18
and

2664.119 --> 2670.319
what was they saying

2667.18 --> 2670.319
what's it talking about

2672.819 --> 2676.14
I lost my train of thought

2679.72 --> 2684.9399999999996
oh right right

2681.76 --> 2688.119
that yeah I just think that the whole

2684.94 --> 2691.599
Nazi Germany is basically divided in two

2688.119 --> 2694.839
parts that's what I believe it's just

2691.599 --> 2697.2400000000002
from my analysis that's what I think I'm

2694.839 --> 2701.4
not entirely sure I wasn't born yet

2697.24 --> 2701.3999999999996
right oh my God

2710.2 --> 2714.0
is it working is it worth yeah

2717.4 --> 2721.599
right

2719.2 --> 2724.4199999999996
and that the first part of it was

2721.599 --> 2727.1800000000003
actually kind of sensible

2724.42 --> 2728.6800000000003
it was based on creating good morality

2727.18 --> 2731.5
from

2728.68 --> 2734.6189999999997
from a bad position from poverty and

2731.5 --> 2736.78
find like the roots again and respect

2734.619 --> 2740.26
the old

2736.78 --> 2742.48
ideas like the roots just

2740.26 --> 2743.8
like more about the identity of the

2742.48 --> 2746.68
German people

2743.8 --> 2748.54
like reinvigorating it and and releasing

2746.68 --> 2749.98
it in ways

2748.54 --> 2754.02
from

2749.98 --> 2754.02
and other formal tyranny

2754.68 --> 2760.8999999999996
but then it basically turned into just

2758.14 --> 2763.1189999999997
this weird manipulative war machine that

2760.9 --> 2766.78
was very satanic

2763.119 --> 2769.119
where eventually just might makes right

2766.78 --> 2772.6600000000003
became the whole

2769.119 --> 2774.88
like the only motto left

2772.66 --> 2777.22
and which is like extremely

2774.88 --> 2779.56
counterproductive towards well the

2777.22 --> 2783.48
starting principles of it all and that's

2779.56 --> 2786.599
why I think it it wasn't the same thing

2783.48 --> 2786.599

2791.98 --> 2798.46

2822.7 --> 2824.7
um

2827.92 --> 2830.94

[Music]

2887.13 --> 2891.739
[Music]

2906.94 --> 2914.38
but yeah I do actually think that

2911.8 --> 2917.98
ah

2914.38 --> 2919.839
I've always had like this really

2917.98 --> 2922.839
this effect where I just can't really

2919.839 --> 2924.7599999999998
place like the order of how things

2922.839 --> 2926.2599999999998
actually happen

2924.76 --> 2927.46
with Hitler

2926.26 --> 2931.2400000000002
like

2927.46 --> 2934.96
what was the moment where suddenly he he

2931.24 --> 2936.22
started like really ranting and blaming

2934.96 --> 2937.48
Jews

2936.22 --> 2940.4199999999996
like that

2937.48 --> 2942.579
which is like

2940.42 --> 2946.2400000000002
odd

2942.579 --> 2949.92
when exactly did that happen

2946.24 --> 2949.9199999999996
at right because

2951.78 --> 2954.909
[Music]

2955.18 --> 2962.7999999999997
yeah and like what did that mean because

2958.9 --> 2965.2000000000003
maybe it was just at first just like

2962.8 --> 2967.96
being honest and just saying like yeah

2965.2 --> 2970.96
this is what they do

2967.96 --> 2972.76
and that well those Jews would probably

2970.96 --> 2975.579
even respect that

2972.76 --> 2978.0400000000004
it's like oh damn he's actually strong

2975.579 --> 2981.6600000000003
enough to just say it

2978.04 --> 2985.079
right but when did it suddenly turn

2981.66 --> 2985.0789999999997
Beyond just

2985.119 --> 2991.06
observation to like oh we should do this

2989.02 --> 2993.04
and that and we should isolate them or

2991.06 --> 2995.7999999999997
something I

2993.04 --> 2998.14
it's kind of fuzzy to me

2995.8 --> 3001.6400000000003
I've not really like done extensive

2998.14 --> 3001.64
historical study like that

3002.04 --> 3006.18
but

3003.54 --> 3008.64
are always wondering like it just

3006.18 --> 3011.22
doesn't make any sense it really to me

3008.64 --> 3014.94
it's like two different people

3011.22 --> 3019.14
it's like the the war hero Hitler

3014.94 --> 3021.78
because that's what it was I mean he had

3019.14 --> 3023.339
seen some dark [ __ ] through battle and

3021.78 --> 3026.0600000000004
all that

3023.339 --> 3026.06
and

3026.46 --> 3032.819
yeah makes sense that

3029.099 --> 3035.819
he would never then it's like

3032.819 --> 3039.96
people that are gone have gone through

3035.819 --> 3042.72
those types of situation don't do that

3039.96 --> 3045.06
because they know how terrible War

3042.72 --> 3047.8799999999997
actually is

3045.06 --> 3050.16
they would rather have like the strength

3047.88 --> 3052.92
of just military cohesion and respect

3050.16 --> 3056.3999999999996
and all that and Order and stability not

3052.92 --> 3058.079
war so it just seems to me that at some

3056.4 --> 3060.54
point he would have had to been like

3058.079 --> 3062.52
switched out like everything switched

3060.54 --> 3064.5589999999997
around because I just don't I can't

3062.52 --> 3067.02
believe that Hitler would actually do

3064.559 --> 3069.3
that that not that oh my God he did but

3067.02 --> 3072.359
that he would actually be physically

3069.3 --> 3073.8
capable spiritually capable of doing

3072.359 --> 3076.74
that

3073.8 --> 3081.02
after everything he's been through

3076.74 --> 3081.02
it seems illogical to me

3089.52 --> 3095.46
I mean if it was really the same guy

3092.46 --> 3097.38
what the hell happened to that guy

3095.46 --> 3101.2400000000002
I mean that must have been something

3097.38 --> 3101.2400000000002
really bizarre then

3102.78 --> 3106.5
because it just doesn't make any logical

3105.0 --> 3109.559
sense

3106.5 --> 3114.24
like how that rolled out that just it

3109.559 --> 3117.42
doesn't match it's it can't be like that

3114.24 --> 3119.35
the spirit doesn't work like that

3117.42 --> 3122.639
with nobody

3119.35 --> 3122.639
[Music]

3132.359 --> 3137.2799999999997
right or am I wrong maybe maybe I'm

3135.48 --> 3140.059
overlooking something maybe it does

3137.28 --> 3140.059
actually happen

3146.579 --> 3149.579
foreign

3155.28 --> 3162.19
because I could theoretically imagine

3158.64 --> 3163.2599999999998
that let's just say a soldier

3162.19 --> 3165.119
[Music]

3163.26 --> 3170.46
whatever

3165.119 --> 3174.42
that's been like a veteran that has like

3170.46 --> 3176.52
just seen like good strong Parts in the

3174.42 --> 3178.859
war and like kept things together and

3176.52 --> 3181.98
that's not really seen

3178.859 --> 3183.72
like horrible horrible situations with

3181.98 --> 3185.88
yeah they did go through World War one

3183.72 --> 3186.7799999999997
it was horrifying all of it all of it

3185.88 --> 3188.46
was

3186.78 --> 3191.7000000000003
terrible

3188.46 --> 3194.64
right but

3191.7 --> 3196.5589999999997
if like somebody wouldn't have actually

3194.64 --> 3198.5989999999997
gone through that then I might imagine

3196.559 --> 3201.1800000000003
that they could still

3198.599 --> 3204.2400000000002
have that Spirit to push it

3201.18 --> 3207.1189999999997
right but Hitler did actually go through

3204.24 --> 3208.319
that and he even got wounded and [ __ ] I

3207.119 --> 3211.1400000000003
mean

3208.319 --> 3213.8
just doesn't make sense it doesn't make

3211.14 --> 3213.7999999999997
sense to me

3218.76 --> 3224.2200000000003
right so to me it's just it starts to

3222.24 --> 3225.7799999999997
fit in my head as soon as I just say

3224.22 --> 3228.5989999999997
okay

3225.78 --> 3230.119
he got to a point where he basically

3228.599 --> 3232.98
built up

3230.119 --> 3235.559
Germany and the spirit of Germany to a

3232.98 --> 3238.26
point that it's like yeah

3235.559 --> 3241.3190000000004
what do we do either we just like

3238.26 --> 3242.8190000000004
fortify it like go Switzerland sort of

3241.319 --> 3245.88
right

3242.819 --> 3249.0589999999997
like yeah we just strengthen our borders

3245.88 --> 3250.38
more and more and just focus Inward and

3249.059 --> 3252.78
or

3250.38 --> 3255.54
you could go to war but then everything

3252.78 --> 3257.579
is almost lost like and

3255.54 --> 3259.74
it just seems more logical that he just

3257.579 --> 3262.02
basically handed over the Reigns to

3259.74 --> 3264.54
somebody else and that there was a

3262.02 --> 3268.14
lesbian Hitler

3264.54 --> 3272.839
somebody else a double that probably was

3268.14 --> 3272.839
a woman secretly with a fake mustache

3272.94 --> 3277.68
that with a very different type of

3275.099 --> 3280.98
Personality that probably had never seen

3277.68 --> 3283.5589999999997
War but probably has seen sexual abuse

3280.98 --> 3287.46
and such type of [ __ ]

3283.559 --> 3290.7000000000003
that they then replaced Hitler with

3287.46 --> 3292.14
so it was actually another regime in a

3290.7 --> 3295.2
way

3292.14 --> 3296.339
that was pretending to be the Hitler

3295.2 --> 3298.6189999999997
regime

3296.339 --> 3300.839
to still take the reins of that

3298.619 --> 3302.88
Grassroots mind control and in that way

3300.839 --> 3304.5589999999997
Hitler did actually whether he

3302.88 --> 3306.48
completely realized it or not he

3304.559 --> 3309.2400000000002
probably would have had to to a certain

3306.48 --> 3311.64
degree that he actually really betrayed

3309.24 --> 3313.41
all of that

3311.64 --> 3316.56
by letting this all happen

3313.41 --> 3316.56
[Music]

3322.38 --> 3325.52
what are you talking about

3331.44 --> 3335.119
did you see that what's going on

3340.39 --> 3343.5899999999997
[Music]

3355.92 --> 3360.1800000000003
hey Leo

3358.5 --> 3362.64
oh you're right yeah yeah I get that now

3360.18 --> 3365.94
BJ it's just that you did that quite a

3362.64 --> 3368.22
few times in a row but yeah

3365.94 --> 3371.16
I hope it's starting to make more sense

3368.22 --> 3373.859
why I'm being so specific

3371.16 --> 3377.0989999999997
about my idea

3373.859 --> 3379.02
I mean own Benjamin thinks that it's the

3377.099 --> 3381.3590000000004
same person and that he basically went

3379.02 --> 3385.579
on drugs and then completely insane and

3381.359 --> 3385.5789999999997
it was basically a mental patient

3386.52 --> 3392.0
during the entire War

3389.099 --> 3392.0
I mean

3392.04 --> 3396.42
Maybe

3393.54 --> 3397.68
but at the same time

3396.42 --> 3401.7000000000003
just

3397.68 --> 3404.819
no it doesn't really fit to me and well

3401.7 --> 3409.0789999999997
now I've basically tried to lay out

3404.819 --> 3413.9
why and how and how I think Hitler would

3409.079 --> 3413.9
have been before all that and then

3414.119 --> 3419.579
how how it just doesn't fit it doesn't

3417.54 --> 3424.68
fit if you just assume it's the same

3419.579 --> 3427.26
person it's too dramatic a change

3424.68 --> 3429.359
I mean when you're already an older man

3427.26 --> 3432.059
and you've been through Wars and you've

3429.359 --> 3435.0
seen friends die and

3432.059 --> 3437.4
and terrible horror Horrors

3435.0 --> 3440.819
in your lifetime like

3437.4 --> 3444.3
that doesn't then just it's like if he

3440.819 --> 3446.16
was like a really young man or something

3444.3 --> 3448.8590000000004
like a really young man that goes

3446.16 --> 3450.7799999999997
through serious War [ __ ] yeah they're

3448.859 --> 3452.5789999999997
[ __ ] up and they might go crazy but

3450.78 --> 3455.099
then they can still like still because

3452.579 --> 3457.2000000000003
they're young they have still potential

3455.099 --> 3460.559
doesn't always succeed

3457.2 --> 3463.7999999999997
of actually transforming but Hitler was

3460.559 --> 3466.3190000000004
already an older man it makes no sense

3463.8 --> 3470.7200000000003
it makes no sense

3466.319 --> 3470.72
it just it no

3472.98 --> 3476.72
you see what I'm feeling

3481.25 --> 3488.38
[Music]

3492.059 --> 3499.6400000000003
and so I'm still convinced that no it

3494.819 --> 3499.64
wasn't the same man or woman

3504.42 --> 3512.119
it's just couldn't be

3508.2 --> 3512.1189999999997
I think that Hitler was a man

3513.0 --> 3516.24
and that

3515.16 --> 3519.14
yeah

3516.24 --> 3521.339
eventually he made a deal

3519.14 --> 3523.5589999999997
potentially with the devil I mean the

3521.339 --> 3525.839
Vatican was there and [ __ ]

3523.559 --> 3528.0
it's very likely that he just kind of

3525.839 --> 3530.48
made a deal with the devil and sold out

3528.0 --> 3530.48
everything

3531.54 --> 3537.839
just to get out and go to retirement but

3535.26 --> 3540.7990000000004
that in doing so he basically sacrificed

3537.839 --> 3540.799
everything he built

3542.88 --> 3548.4
but I don't think that he was the one

3545.22 --> 3550.5589999999997
actually being that Hitler that so

3548.4 --> 3553.2000000000003
Infamous and shouting towards giant

3550.559 --> 3555.299
crowds all the time and

3553.2 --> 3559.7599999999998
blaming the Jews forever I don't think

3555.299 --> 3559.7599999999998
it's him it just makes no sense

3563.04 --> 3568.22
secret Atlanta take base or or just

3565.559 --> 3568.2200000000003
Argentina

3568.619 --> 3573.799
or maybe through Argentina to no

3570.96 --> 3573.799

3575.28 --> 3581.6400000000003
that t-shirt is awesome thanks yeah

3578.64 --> 3585.319
that's you mean my uh

3581.64 --> 3585.319
my holographic t-shirt

3587.28 --> 3592.079
that you can thank steamy traveler for

3589.26 --> 3594.3190000000004
that he uh his cousin or something made

3592.079 --> 3594.319
it

3594.66 --> 3599.819
or like he has a

3597.059 --> 3601.38
his cousin works with the T-shirt some

3599.819 --> 3605.099
[ __ ]

3601.38 --> 3607.5
he had it made it and sent thank you so

3605.099 --> 3615.159
much it's like my favorite shirt now

3607.5 --> 3615.159
[Music]

3621.24 --> 3625.9399999999996
something doesn't end up with Hitler he

3623.52 --> 3625.94
changed

3626.16 --> 3632.3999999999996
that he wasn't but

3628.38 --> 3635.2200000000003
paid to see that maybe he was at first

3632.4 --> 3638.1600000000003
actually a great man and I think that he

3635.22 --> 3641.7599999999998
made a deal with the devil and that's

3638.16 --> 3646.6189999999997
when the real him probably Tapped Out

3641.76 --> 3649.92
and replaced with an actor or actress

3646.619 --> 3653.9
and that after that point is when the

3649.92 --> 3653.9
supposed Hitler did the most damage

3659.4 --> 3665.64
it's weird man because

3661.74 --> 3668.5789999999997
like think about it in like vague

3665.64 --> 3671.339
contextually that deal of the devil

3668.579 --> 3674.3390000000004
might be a much bigger deal than we are

3671.339 --> 3679.38
even pretty of understanding

3674.339 --> 3682.619
yeah it might be the deal

3679.38 --> 3684.1800000000003
to actually colonize the Lands Beyond

3682.619 --> 3685.94
Antarctica

3684.18 --> 3690.0789999999997
including noise

3685.94 --> 3690.079
maybe that was the deal

3690.48 --> 3696.599
it's like okay

3692.94 --> 3697.7400000000002
you can have that but you must leave

3696.599 --> 3700.6800000000003
behind

3697.74 --> 3703.859
a replacement that will be like the

3700.68 --> 3708.8999999999996
ultimate villain forever

3703.859 --> 3713.7599999999998
so that you could sort of like have your

3708.9 --> 3716.04
Third Reich outside of the realm

3713.76 --> 3719.2200000000003
and that they could never be like

3716.04 --> 3720.7799999999997
mingled up to separate the power

3719.22 --> 3723.54
you see

3720.78 --> 3726.48
I mean it might have just happened I

3723.54 --> 3728.64
mean maybe that weird

3726.48 --> 3730.26
map thing

3728.64 --> 3732.0
remember

3730.26 --> 3735.7400000000002
showed the other day I'll present it

3732.0 --> 3735.74
again so I was thinking about it

3737.52 --> 3740.059
come on

3745.02 --> 3749.599
right

3746.76 --> 3749.599
remember that

3751.98 --> 3754.579
although

3756.67 --> 3759.829
[Music]

3760.44 --> 3763.559
foreign

3761.819 --> 3766.38
yeah

3763.559 --> 3769.079
well in zoomed in version of this

3766.38 --> 3775.28
there's literal Nazi bases marked with

3769.079 --> 3775.28
swastikas so maybe that was the deal

3775.799 --> 3780.54
the deal with the devil that actually

3777.839 --> 3783.24
created all this [ __ ]

3780.54 --> 3786.119
and like the ultimate controlled

3783.24 --> 3788.5789999999997
opponent myth

3786.119 --> 3790.98
maybe it was the deal that Hitler made

3788.579 --> 3794.3390000000004
to gain

3790.98 --> 3797.04
like a sort of official permission to

3794.339 --> 3800.94
just take all this [ __ ]

3797.04 --> 3803.819
and be there but separate

3800.94 --> 3806.42
from the the typically known Earth

3803.819 --> 3806.42
continent

3806.76 --> 3809.2990000000004
huh

3814.38 --> 3819.9
Yeah the secret and Arctic Base yeah you

3817.319 --> 3823.98
could call it that but I think that well

3819.9 --> 3827.1600000000003
this little alleged map gives uh yeah a

3823.98 --> 3829.2
lot more detailed Insight on well what

3827.16 --> 3832.6189999999997
that actually implies I mean it's not

3829.2 --> 3836.64
like oh yeah you get a little island or

3832.619 --> 3839.88
you get one continent like Australia

3836.64 --> 3841.02
right well just look at this thing look

3839.88 --> 3843.78
at this

3841.02 --> 3845.7
noise schwaben Lunt is little thing

3843.78 --> 3847.92
right here I don't know if you can see

3845.7 --> 3852.0589999999997
my mouse pointer

3847.92 --> 3857.16
is just as big as freaking Australia

3852.059 --> 3860.1600000000003
oh and there is more like as in all the

3857.16 --> 3863.2799999999997
world's surface

3860.16 --> 3865.5
times three

3863.28 --> 3868.079
on top of that yeah that's a that's

3865.5 --> 3870.119
literally a big deal isn't it

3868.079 --> 3871.38
so

3870.119 --> 3874.079
yeah

3871.38 --> 3877.339
maybe that is what that deal with the

3874.079 --> 3877.3390000000004
devil was about

3880.98 --> 3885.18
I guess I'm making it very

3882.78 --> 3886.619
conspiratorial that way

3885.18 --> 3889.2
but yeah

3886.619 --> 3892.52
I would like to make you think

3889.2 --> 3892.52
I think this will do it

3909.54 --> 3916.38
how or what I wonder is what these deals

3913.26 --> 3919.6800000000003
look like well think of

3916.38 --> 3921.599
how Empires do deals

3919.68 --> 3923.94
it's like

3921.599 --> 3927.42
you have kingdoms

3923.94 --> 3929.9
and then you have the covert emperor of

3927.42 --> 3929.9
the world

3930.119 --> 3934.5
whatever

3932.04 --> 3937.44
and that might be like the black pope or

3934.5 --> 3940.68
something well you make a deal with the

3937.44 --> 3944.339
devil well that means that's gonna be a

3940.68 --> 3945.54
big price massive price like insane

3944.339 --> 3949.38
prices

3945.54 --> 3951.0
but also in insane results I mean if

3949.38 --> 3954.5
you're going to be like yeah I want to

3951.0 --> 3954.5
colonize that entire place

3954.599 --> 3960.26
well okay says the emperor of the world

3958.44 --> 3965.46
the black pope

3960.26 --> 3968.48
this is what this is how I will allow

3965.46 --> 3968.48
you to do that

3970.799 --> 3976.98
and then the very sneaky plan like you

3973.14 --> 3979.5589999999997
leave behind a fake you that we then

3976.98 --> 3983.16
take complete control over and we will

3979.559 --> 3987.119
destroy it and you will be infamous

3983.16 --> 3988.799
and hate it for generations and used as

3987.119 --> 3991.02
a boogeyman figure

3988.799 --> 3994.7
so you can never come back you can never

3991.02 --> 3994.7
take over the realm

3995.7 --> 4000.8799999999997
Arrow but you can have that other one

3998.099 --> 4000.88
that's the condition

4002.41 --> 4009.6499999999996
[Music]

4013.0 --> 4020.42
right I mean doesn't that put things in

4017.0 --> 4022.31
a more logical context and just oh it's

4020.42 --> 4024.98
just for the evil

4022.31 --> 4028.94
[Music]

4024.98 --> 4032.119
big moves have big prices

4028.94 --> 4033.859
and that's part of deals of devil right

4032.119 --> 4035.359
the problem with dealing with the Devil

4033.859 --> 4037.2799999999997
is usually the people that are dumb

4035.359 --> 4038.839
enough to do it they're always in over

4037.28 --> 4041.299
their head they don't even understand

4038.839 --> 4043.52
like the weight

4041.299 --> 4046.579
of everything that's going on they just

4043.52 --> 4050.44
they're blind hungry for power and

4046.579 --> 4050.44
that's how they then lose everything

4052.099 --> 4054.6400000000003
anyway

4055.819 --> 4058.0
foreign

4059.859 --> 4067.22
so yeah maybe maybe Hitler moved out and

4063.859 --> 4070.2799999999997
became emperor of Antarctica

4067.22 --> 4073.0389999999998
which happens to be massive potentially

4070.28 --> 4075.28
bigger than all the Earth the continents

4073.039 --> 4075.28
together

4075.74 --> 4078.52
who knows

4079.599 --> 4085.1600000000003
oh damn it

4082.299 --> 4085.83
Hitler was there first

4085.16 --> 4090.8889999999997
Maybe

4085.83 --> 4090.889
[Music]

4106.04 --> 4110.6
all right so that's like a little

4107.9 --> 4114.219
expansion on the idea of no he just went

4110.6 --> 4117.08
to enter or do uh Argentina

4114.219 --> 4118.1
but yeah Argentina could have been a

4117.08 --> 4120.44
stop

4118.1 --> 4122.839
an in-between stop

4120.44 --> 4125.419999999999
or it might have been like oh yeah

4122.839 --> 4128.239
Argentina is like the only country that

4125.42 --> 4130.1
you are still just allowed to visit the

4128.239 --> 4132.5
rest of your life

4130.1 --> 4134.2390000000005
but you can't go anywhere else

4132.5 --> 4137.12
it could have been that

4134.239 --> 4139.8189999999995
also that he wasn't just always there

4137.12 --> 4143.62
but that he might have gone there

4139.819 --> 4143.620000000001
and like it's like oh hi

4143.839 --> 4148.58
I'm here in Argentina on vacation and

4146.239 --> 4150.799
then he went away again to Antarctica to

4148.58 --> 4153.8189999999995
do stuff

4150.799 --> 4153.819
could have been there

4155.179 --> 4161.2390000000005
or could also be is that basically

4158.54 --> 4163.2789999999995
Argentina was his kind of command base

4161.239 --> 4165.8589999999995
for Antarctica

4163.279 --> 4168.14
and that he was always just there that

4165.859 --> 4169.58
he didn't actually go himself to

4168.14 --> 4169.9400000000005
Antarctica

4223.34 --> 4225.88

4225.98 --> 4233.78
right so yeah probably uh throughout

4229.34 --> 4236.42
enough stuff to make you think again

4233.78 --> 4237.259999999999
these are like some of these puzzles I

4236.42 --> 4244.1
wonder about

4248.36 --> 4254.139999999999

4285.34 --> 4290.860000000001

4308.9 --> 4313.42
yes Derek too much sport talk

4313.76 --> 4316.76
oh

4321.26 --> 4324.04
wow

4331.76 --> 4334.719
okay

4337.159 --> 4340.0
the [ __ ]

4340.699 --> 4346.5199999999995
Adam Megan just sent me like what seems

4344.12 --> 4350.42
like an old

4346.52 --> 4354.040000000001
old Nazi Germany exploration map of

4350.42 --> 4354.04
Antarctica what the

4363.94 --> 4370.12
wow that is freaking surreal oh yeah I'm

4367.219 --> 4370.12
gonna present that

4370.159 --> 4373.839999999999
that is just what

4374.06 --> 4377.1990000000005
right uh

4380.9 --> 4388.36
just just take a look at this

4385.46 --> 4388.36
oh [ __ ]

4414.38 --> 4418.42
this stupid thing lagging

4425.719 --> 4431.36
right so they

4427.94 --> 4435.219
so it it's weird that they're using like

4431.36 --> 4435.219
the Antarctic glow projection

4435.44 --> 4441.08
but apparently yeah they found a way

4437.84 --> 4442.2300000000005
under the ice and

4441.08 --> 4444.32
foreign

4442.23 --> 4447.159

4444.32 --> 4447.159

4450.92 --> 4456.88

4453.38 --> 4456.88
it includes Asgard

4477.42 --> 4480.609
[Music]

4492.62 --> 4498.5
but does that mean that it's all

4495.56 --> 4500.780000000001
subterranean

4498.5 --> 4505.04
all of it

4500.78 --> 4508.639999999999
I mean does that mean that like the

4505.04 --> 4511.34
the whole Moon projection

4508.64 --> 4514.219
so what we think of as a Moon project

4511.34 --> 4517.42
that those Maps is that all

4514.219 --> 4517.42
below the ice

4517.58 --> 4523.42
is it like a

4519.98 --> 4523.419999999999
another layer

4523.94 --> 4526.36
that

4530.36 --> 4535.88
like because that one map I'll show that

4533.54 --> 4538.84
again uh

4535.88 --> 4538.84
all right

4540.44 --> 4543.799999999999
right

4541.64 --> 4545.96
it looks to us like oh yeah that's just

4543.8 --> 4549.14
one open thing and then an art there's

4545.96 --> 4553.46
like this ice wall around our content

4549.14 --> 4556.159000000001
but what if there isn't actually

4553.46 --> 4558.14
that stuff Beyond but that it's under

4556.159 --> 4561.86
another layer

4558.14 --> 4563.719
that it's all ice on top of this and

4561.86 --> 4565.94
that it's literally like an entire

4563.719 --> 4567.8
Subterranean world

4565.94 --> 4570.32
all of that

4567.8 --> 4574.219
I've never even thought of it like that

4570.32 --> 4578.5599999999995
I mean that entire all these lands might

4574.219 --> 4578.56
literally all be subterranean

4579.5 --> 4586.28
covered by an ice sheet and it would be

4582.62 --> 4589.239
I guess dark or maybe there's this other

4586.28 --> 4589.239
things there

4598.52 --> 4602.84
so

4599.9 --> 4605.12
oh wait did I

4602.84 --> 4607.78
present it or not

4605.12 --> 4607.78
damn it

4609.679 --> 4612.159
all right

4618.86 --> 4623.9
the Holo Earth no

4621.739 --> 4626.86
another open layer

4623.9 --> 4626.86
layered Earth

4634.64 --> 4638.38
hello ice yeah right

4638.659 --> 4644.679
maybe all these lands are just one

4642.56 --> 4649.179
gigantic

4644.679 --> 4649.179
terrestrial sized igloo

4651.5 --> 4656.8
right it might be all one gigantic Igloo

4655.4 --> 4660.459
effectively

4656.8 --> 4660.459
[Music]

4663.38 --> 4668.12
maybe our room is already separate well

4665.659 --> 4669.98
that would be weird man if you if you

4668.12 --> 4671.84
think of it like that then yeah well

4669.98 --> 4674.659
who's to say that indeed there's not

4671.84 --> 4677.659000000001
like an ice layer above us there might

4674.659 --> 4681.5
be even another layer on top of that

4677.659 --> 4683.42
with more land maybe it's all just price

4681.5 --> 4686.3
layers

4683.42 --> 4688.58
it's like a layer of ice layer of land a

4686.3 --> 4690.02
layer of ice a layer of land and in some

4688.58 --> 4691.5199999999995
parts there's

4690.02 --> 4694.780000000001
like

4691.52 --> 4694.780000000001
it's Hollow

4694.82 --> 4699.5599999999995
there's air I don't know

4697.1 --> 4702.1990000000005
I mean this is getting hyper speculative

4699.56 --> 4704.3
at this point but

4702.199 --> 4706.28
it is all very

4704.3 --> 4709.84
tintillating

4706.28 --> 4709.84
so consider such things

4710.659 --> 4713.5599999999995
hmm

4730.15 --> 4733.219999999999
[Music]

4742.58 --> 4748.159

4745.34 --> 4752.179
creating that sun

4748.159 --> 4755.599999999999
I mean all of that doesn't exactly make

4752.179 --> 4758.1990000000005
how the realm works less mysterious you

4755.6 --> 4758.1990000000005
know what I mean

4770.98 --> 4775.299999999999
well yeah PJ seen it probably

4801.76 --> 4807.5
[Music]

4803.06 --> 4809.42
anyway it's just yeah one subject leads

4807.5 --> 4812.199
to another which leads to another and

4809.42 --> 4812.1990000000005
leads to this

4814.64 --> 4823.0
you could say a lot of Roads

4818.36 --> 4823.0
end up Crossing in Antarctica but

4847.52 --> 4850.179
hmm

4866.57 --> 4870.88
[Music]

4871.76 --> 4873.9400000000005
thank you

4886.88 --> 4893.96
fiber out of why are you saying

4889.64 --> 4897.9400000000005
the realm is like a totem pole what

4893.96 --> 4897.94
how's that working in your mind

4901.48 --> 4905.0599999999995
also I don't think there's like infinite

4904.159 --> 4907.78
layers

4905.06 --> 4907.780000000001
so

4909.75 --> 4913.0
[Music]

4921.5 --> 4928.64
I mean like the whole

4923.96 --> 4932.659
idea of a Subterranean super eagle

4928.64 --> 4935.360000000001
in Antarctica might be just really very

4932.659 --> 4937.4
unique to Antarctica

4935.36 --> 4941.0599999999995
doesn't mean that that means that

4937.4 --> 4943.4
everything about the realm is the same

4941.06 --> 4947.4400000000005
type of thing it might be just a unique

4943.4 --> 4947.44
formation a giant subterranean

4948.57 --> 4953.179
[Music]

4950.42 --> 4956.7390000000005
ice like Cavern

4953.179 --> 4956.7390000000005
with land underneath there

4957.739 --> 4964.0599999999995
that the ice is just by been piling up

4960.56 --> 4964.06
forever and that eventually

4965.48 --> 4971.9
parts of it melted

4968.5 --> 4974.6
underneath other eyes from terrain yeah

4971.9 --> 4976.639999999999
from basically Subterranean heat might

4974.6 --> 4979.46
who's to say there isn't any kind of

4976.64 --> 4982.52
volcanic activity like in Antarctica

4979.46 --> 4985.42
right but there would be

4982.52 --> 4985.42
then

4985.58 --> 4989.84
yeah why

4987.38 --> 4993.14
wouldn't it then just start to slowly

4989.84 --> 4995.0
hollow out right

4993.14 --> 4997.58
and then at some point find an

4995.0 --> 5000.219
equilibrium because the ice was just so

4997.58 --> 5002.199
incredibly thick that even the volcanic

5000.219 --> 5004.56
heat after some point just won't reach

5002.199 --> 5004.5599999999995
further

5005.56 --> 5009.04
it won't be enough to melt through it

5093.699 --> 5100.32

he's the one that sent me that one

5203.199 --> 5209.379999999999
I don't know man but look

5206.26 --> 5211.4800000000005
if my suspicions about the nature of the

5209.38 --> 5215.08
celestial lights are correct that they

5211.48 --> 5217.419999999999
are basically non-local Holograms

5215.08 --> 5220.5599999999995
then

5217.42 --> 5223.06
they might simply have

5220.56 --> 5226.06
manifestation conditions

5223.06 --> 5229.4800000000005
and that they will just manifest

5226.06 --> 5231.639
wherever maybe even

5229.48 --> 5234.459999999999
in another layer

5231.639 --> 5238.179
right because they're not actually

5234.46 --> 5240.9
things in literal positions so it seems

5238.179 --> 5240.9
literally

5242.08 --> 5247.48
so who's to say that

5244.42 --> 5251.08
they cannot just like re-manifest if

5247.48 --> 5253.12
they got enough room to just like maybe

5251.08 --> 5255.76
that is the condition to just have

5253.12 --> 5257.86
enough room

5255.76 --> 5260.02

5257.86 --> 5261.88

anti-equator

5261.88 --> 5268.2390000000005
so if it's just follow that exact curve

5264.639 --> 5270.46
of equator and equator then maybe even

5268.239 --> 5272.379999999999
in another layer that effect just

5270.46 --> 5274.42
continues and that there might be a sun

5272.38 --> 5277.92
just manifesting even though it's like

5274.42 --> 5277.92
under a layer

5278.88 --> 5284.8
or maybe it manifests differently I've

5282.219 --> 5288.4
heard of this story that there is like a

5284.8 --> 5290.679
light giving purple mist or something

5288.4 --> 5293.44
instead of the Sun

5290.679 --> 5297.04
I don't know if any of you heard of that

5293.44 --> 5300.339999999999
but that might Simply Be The Same

5297.04 --> 5301.84
Celestial effect but like in a different

5300.34 --> 5304.3
type of

5301.84 --> 5307.12
room and maybe if there's a different

5304.3 --> 5310.0
type of room with with a lower ceiling

5307.12 --> 5313.98
then it then instead manifests like a

5310.0 --> 5313.98
weird purple Mist that gives light

5319.21 --> 5323.76
[Music]

5325.96 --> 5332.219
I mean if the Sun is not just an object

5329.02 --> 5334.719
in a literal position in space

5332.219 --> 5338.32
then why would

5334.719 --> 5340.78
it not just manifest

5338.32 --> 5344.5199999999995
on a different height

5340.78 --> 5344.5199999999995
in a different enclosure

5346.96 --> 5353.76
right maybe theoretically

5350.38 --> 5357.639
there's even underneath our realm

5353.76 --> 5360.46
somewhere deep caves like let's just

5357.639 --> 5363.400000000001
imagine let's just fantasize first for

5360.46 --> 5365.32
say for example in Bulgaria those really

5363.4 --> 5368.5
deep caves that there's actually like

5365.32 --> 5370.96
more and more and more that it just like

5368.5 --> 5373.84
takes almost a lifetime to to dig

5370.96 --> 5377.199
through or get through or uncover it and

5373.84 --> 5380.8
other issues and that at some point they

5377.199 --> 5384.159
just really open up to an entire new

5380.8 --> 5385.719
Cavern that is so big

5384.159 --> 5388.659
that

5385.719 --> 5390.46
that like when you descend there maybe

5388.659 --> 5394.54
through a staircase you would have to

5390.46 --> 5397.12
build or like past a wall like some

5394.54 --> 5400.8
super long staircase and that when

5397.12 --> 5400.8
you're at the top it's just black

5402.88 --> 5408.46
but that the lower you climb down then

5406.36 --> 5411.0
it's almost certainly like the sun is

5408.46 --> 5411.0
coming up

5412.06 --> 5416.4400000000005
that there's yeah and that when you

5414.46 --> 5419.44
reach the ground it's like you're just

5416.44 --> 5421.239
standing on Earth again like on the

5419.44 --> 5422.739
normal surface and there's just the sun

5421.239 --> 5426.5199999999995
there and the stars all of a sudden

5422.739 --> 5430.98
they're all back right I mean who is to

5426.52 --> 5430.9800000000005
exclude that that would happen

5431.86 --> 5436.719
who's to say that some Cavern below are

5435.04 --> 5439.48
known realms

5436.719 --> 5440.679
our known realm can't find

5439.48 --> 5443.98
that

5440.679 --> 5445.84
I mean yeah a typical small cave but you

5443.98 --> 5449.98
know yeah this of course it's black I

5445.84 --> 5455.8
mean but what if there is a gigantic

5449.98 --> 5458.08
room maybe even as high as our

5455.8 --> 5460.96
as our realm container

5458.08 --> 5463.36
right well then yeah if you could like

5460.96 --> 5466.179
climb down there it'd probably take some

5463.36 --> 5468.04
time be very scary

5466.179 --> 5470.62
that yeah it's start at the top it's

5468.04 --> 5472.659
like oh we're at this like impossibly

5470.62 --> 5475.12
large cave it's all black around us we

5472.659 --> 5477.5199999999995
can only now see the tunnel we came

5475.12 --> 5479.5599999999995
through and the ceiling and the rest in

5477.52 --> 5481.4800000000005
like the wall

5479.56 --> 5483.280000000001
that we're going to climb past and the

5481.48 --> 5485.379999999999
rest is all black it's just so big and

5483.28 --> 5488.679
black you don't see anything

5485.38 --> 5491.5
and then as you get further down then

5488.679 --> 5494.139
suddenly it's like sadly the sun is very

5491.5 --> 5497.1
slowly starting to come up and it's like

5494.139 --> 5497.1
wait is that

5497.199 --> 5500.799999999999
down there

5499.0 --> 5503.699
what

5500.8 --> 5503.6990000000005
who knows

5504.86 --> 5509.58
[Music]

5519.04 --> 5521.58
foreign

5522.12 --> 5528.04
new fools yeah well they kind of cheated

5525.58 --> 5531.639
with that right you fell down into that

5528.04 --> 5533.44
cave and then suddenly they climbed all

5531.639 --> 5535.96
the way up fighting and then they were

5533.44 --> 5538.199
on a snowy Peak like what the [ __ ] is

5535.96 --> 5538.199
that

5538.96 --> 5545.44
unless they just like fought in the cave

5541.659 --> 5548.92
and then stumbled over the edge and into

5545.44 --> 5551.699
another realm on top of a mountain snowy

5548.92 --> 5551.6990000000005
mountain peak

5551.88 --> 5555.639
foreign

5553.42 --> 5559.6
they never really tell you though like

5555.639 --> 5562.54
how how do these locations connect

5559.6 --> 5566.5
cave deep cave water

5562.54 --> 5567.34
and then oh Gandalf almost dies on the

5566.5 --> 5572.199
top

5567.34 --> 5575.1990000000005
of a mountain a snowy mountain peak what

5572.199 --> 5577.299999999999
how the hell did he get over there in

5575.199 --> 5580.44
the middle of that epic battle like what

5577.3 --> 5580.4400000000005
the [ __ ] going on

5580.9 --> 5586.96
right

5583.54 --> 5589.04
so yeah it's open for Fantastical

5586.96 --> 5590.8
speculation I'd say

5589.04 --> 5593.38
[Music]

5590.8 --> 5595.84
or above and So Below yeah well maybe he

5593.38 --> 5598.719
would maybe he fell through the vertical

5595.84 --> 5600.46
Loop and it's like oh the cave Splash

5598.719 --> 5602.26
and they battle and then it's like oh

5600.46 --> 5604.659
stumble in another hole and then they

5602.26 --> 5606.58
fell down

5604.659 --> 5609.159
the bottom

5606.58 --> 5612.58
straight back onto the surface

5609.159 --> 5614.98
could be two who knows I don't know how

5612.58 --> 5619.8
that was envisioned in that movie or if

5614.98 --> 5619.799999999999
that was even remotely intentional

5621.52 --> 5626.320000000001
I don't know if that was like the

5623.98 --> 5628.718999999999
intention of Tolkien even I don't

5626.32 --> 5631.179
remember it even having that much detail

5628.719 --> 5634.4800000000005
I mean the movie really gave extra

5631.179 --> 5637.12
detail to that scene because in the book

5634.48 --> 5639.159
it didn't tell you it's just no no he

5637.12 --> 5641.44
fell down and everybody's really sad and

5639.159 --> 5644.86
then move on and then only much later

5641.44 --> 5646.299999999999
start Gandalf describes roughly what

5644.86 --> 5648.46
happens it doesn't happen in the movie

5646.3 --> 5651.52
like in the movie they put this little

5648.46 --> 5653.26
big scene to get amazing it's

5651.52 --> 5655.42
to be fair I thought it was most

5653.26 --> 5657.159000000001
exhilarating scene in the entire movie

5655.42 --> 5658.719
so

5657.159 --> 5661.9
Epic

5658.719 --> 5663.34
but not as it was written about by

5661.9 --> 5666.46
Tolkien

5663.34 --> 5668.32
so was that just like a little bit of

5666.46 --> 5670.36
wild like oh

5668.32 --> 5672.4
yeah oh

5670.36 --> 5676.239
deep in the cave on a Mountaintop yeah

5672.4 --> 5679.0199999999995
you figure it out Watcher ha ha ha or

5676.239 --> 5679.0199999999995
I don't know

5701.38 --> 5703.92
hmm

5706.06 --> 5710.34
okay if you just seen that interesting

5713.05 --> 5722.9490000000005
[Music]

5726.66 --> 5732.979
[Music]

5756.46 --> 5760.3
anyway yeah this is pretty interesting

5758.98 --> 5761.799999999999
stuff

5760.3 --> 5765.04
a lot

5761.8 --> 5766.659000000001
speculating about that sort of thing

5765.04 --> 5770.699
right but I am going to take a two

5766.659 --> 5770.699
minute break so I'll be right back

5796.54 --> 5799.5
foreign

5846.58 --> 5848.76
thank you

5866.159 --> 5871.32
you can link it yeah sure but you just

5868.96 --> 5871.32
seen it

5879.219 --> 5882.78
ah man

5884.26 --> 5887.34
so gold

5889.01 --> 5892.1990000000005
[Music]

5905.62 --> 5909.4
all right if you're gonna link it make

5907.42 --> 5912.46
sure it's not like one of these insane

5909.4 --> 5914.138999999999
Google links just an actual proper link

5912.46 --> 5916.179
thank you

5914.139 --> 5917.9400000000005
that would be great otherwise if it's

5916.179 --> 5921.4
like a file

5917.94 --> 5922.96
you can technically email it to me pjc

5921.4 --> 5925.599999999999
Nev

5922.96 --> 5927.34
right just upload it email it and then I

5925.6 --> 5930.360000000001
can like literally

5927.34 --> 5930.360000000001
present it here

5930.639 --> 5934.900000000001
that can also help

5932.44 --> 5937.54
I mean if you come across like really

5934.9 --> 5939.94
interesting stuff like well like these

5937.54 --> 5943.54
types of things

5939.94 --> 5945.58
but email it to me if if you want I mean

5943.54 --> 5947.88
you don't have to but I would appreciate

5945.58 --> 5947.88
that

5948.219 --> 5952.719
all right as long as it's not going to

5949.84 --> 5957.04
be like oh every day something like if

5952.719 --> 5960.04
it's gonna fill up my box then

5957.04 --> 5964.0199999999995
I'd rather have that you just like

5960.04 --> 5964.0199999999995
gave it all in one go or something

5964.659 --> 5967.138999999999
anyway

5967.96 --> 5975.58
I do appreciate people that watch me

5971.44 --> 5978.419999999999
send me emails with interesting stuff

5975.58 --> 5978.42
and pictures

5979.719 --> 5983.8
because I've not really collected a lot

5982.3 --> 5987.6990000000005
of it I mean

5983.8 --> 5989.52
I was extremely just observing in like

5987.699 --> 5993.099999999999
the early Flat Earth days

5989.52 --> 5995.5
2015-16 and 17. and it was never really

5993.1 --> 5996.820000000001
good at collecting it's like oh yeah

5995.5 --> 5999.4
I'll download this and I'll download

5996.82 --> 6002.239
that because well there was also just a

5999.4 --> 6002.239
lot of junk around

6003.179 --> 6007.92
and

6005.219 --> 6010.76
I just didn't want to fill up my

6007.92 --> 6010.76
computer like that

6010.8 --> 6015.06
but that way yeah I still missed a bunch

6013.32 --> 6019.159
of things

6015.06 --> 6019.159000000001
that I wish that I had downloaded it

6019.52 --> 6025.820000000001
but yeah it's too late for that time has

6023.4 --> 6025.82
passed

6038.04 --> 6040.699
foreign

6069.42 --> 6071.6
foreign

6103.82 --> 6110.0599999999995
okay yeah well this source is just a

6106.92 --> 6110.06
bunch of blabber mouths

6110.28 --> 6115.82
we have a pretty good picture though

6112.679 --> 6115.82
very detailed

6136.139 --> 6143.58
yeah but that link does provide a pretty

6139.32 --> 6146.46
high resolution picture of yeah

6143.58 --> 6149.54
what I just presented so that looks good

6146.46 --> 6149.54
for that at least

6150.0 --> 6155.699
although it seems everybody in the

6153.0 --> 6158.84
comments actually is hyper skeptical oh

6155.699 --> 6158.839999999999
it's all faked

6165.9 --> 6168.5599999999995
okay

6178.92 --> 6181.92
hmm

6184.5 --> 6190.06
right yeah good link

6187.98 --> 6193.289
thank you for that

6190.06 --> 6193.289000000001
[Music]

6215.219 --> 6217.94
oh

6228.0 --> 6230.719
right

6231.239 --> 6235.98
yeah you can actually download that

6233.88 --> 6239.6990000000005
picture so

6235.98 --> 6241.179999999999
now I have it on my desktop too

[Music]

6279.06 --> 6282.06
foreign

6288.6 --> 6292.9800000000005
trust the powers of the world to tell

6290.76 --> 6296.58
each other well for us well price of

6292.98 --> 6300.599999999999
Adam you gotta realize also that

6296.58 --> 6303.0599999999995
well these Nazi Germans were at War

6300.6 --> 6303.96
and there was spying going on and coding

6303.06 --> 6308.639
and

6303.96 --> 6310.32
it could be a forgery by them

6308.639 --> 6313.32
yeah

6310.32 --> 6316.699
that doesn't and the weird thing is what

6313.32 --> 6320.58
that thing could be is basically a

6316.699 --> 6323.099999999999
misleading map that they leak

6320.58 --> 6326.28
to kind of cover for the actual route

6323.1 --> 6329.76
that they would know so that if some

6326.28 --> 6331.92
invade yeah some hostile Force

6329.76 --> 6334.7390000000005
would go for it that they would actually

6331.92 --> 6337.159
run into a dead end if they try to

6334.739 --> 6337.159
follow him

6337.5 --> 6341.159
right

6338.699 --> 6345.299999999999
and that the real map

6341.159 --> 6347.759999999999
would just be known by the the generals

6345.3 --> 6350.219
or the the submarine commanders they had

6347.76 --> 6353.04
to learn it by heart and that any real

6350.219 --> 6355.38
map would have to be burned because only

6353.04 --> 6358.5
the fake Maps were allowed to hang

6355.38 --> 6360.06
around to potentially fall in the hands

6358.5 --> 6363.36
of the enemy

6360.06 --> 6364.92
they think like oh wow we got secret map

6363.36 --> 6367.619
[Music]

6364.92 --> 6369.6
and then they spend resources and time

6367.619 --> 6371.94
and planning to get there and then it

6369.6 --> 6374.159000000001
runs into a dead end and then the real

6371.94 --> 6376.199
route is still concealed right it could

6374.159 --> 6378.239
be that too

6376.199 --> 6382.619
there's all kinds of possibilities I

6378.239 --> 6385.138999999999
mean trickery in war is not a like a

6382.619 --> 6387.259999999999
super modern thing

6385.139 --> 6389.52
like leaking

6387.26 --> 6392.34
misleading Maps

6389.52 --> 6395.719
I think that's been used since

6392.34 --> 6395.719
well since map making

6395.82 --> 6400.92
so you don't exactly know whether this

6398.4 --> 6403.739
was like an original it's very unlikely

6400.92 --> 6405.119
that it was because the really important

6403.739 --> 6408.9
secret stuff

6405.119 --> 6411.48
would likely be made revealed in secret

6408.9 --> 6413.879999999999
meeting everybody memorized it and they

6411.48 --> 6415.5599999999995
would probably even be picked to be in

6413.88 --> 6419.400000000001
that function if they had secret

6415.56 --> 6422.639
memorization or they would have like the

6419.4 --> 6425.46
specific nerds to remember that

6422.639 --> 6428.84
and then they'd burn the real thing and

6425.46 --> 6428.84
then only the people would know

6429.48 --> 6435.599999999999
and that's like a more effective way to

6432.84 --> 6436.1
both keep loyalty and power within the

6435.6 --> 6438.780000000001
group

6436.1 --> 6443.159000000001
[Music]

6438.78 --> 6445.58
I think I mean that's how I'd imagine it

6443.159 --> 6445.58
right

6452.159 --> 6457.86
but however you approach it it is still

6455.28 --> 6459.659
incredibly fascinating

6457.86 --> 6463.32
right

6459.659 --> 6467.339999999999
right it's an original real thing or

6463.32 --> 6469.44
even if it wasn't misleading map

6467.34 --> 6472.38
that doesn't mean that there wouldn't be

6469.44 --> 6474.178999999999
an actual route between the eyes for

6472.38 --> 6477.3
submarines

6474.179 --> 6479.639
and that this was just a this was just

6477.3 --> 6481.9800000000005
the dead end map to basically get people

6479.639 --> 6483.36
stuck in the ice like the opponent lured

6481.98 --> 6484.799999999999
them in there and then they're trapped

6483.36 --> 6488.58
and dead

6484.8 --> 6490.1990000000005
I mean that's a very cheap cheap way to

6488.58 --> 6493.639
take out your opponent wouldn't it

6490.199 --> 6493.638999999999
wouldn't it be right

6499.92 --> 6505.58
but anyway I might be over speculating a

6503.4 --> 6505.58
bit

6511.86 --> 6515.699
compartment lies until the internet

6513.719 --> 6517.58
comes right well now everything's

6515.699 --> 6520.32
different

6517.58 --> 6523.32
information spreads around very quickly

6520.32 --> 6525.739
and thus also misinformation is much

6523.32 --> 6525.739
more

6525.8 --> 6530.1
normalized

6527.54 --> 6532.32
unfortunately yeah the faster

6530.1 --> 6535.679
information spread the the more

6532.32 --> 6536.94
misinformation will be used because well

6535.679 --> 6538.86
it spread so fast

6536.94 --> 6541.678999999999
[Music]

6538.86 --> 6544.759999999999
just like real information

6541.679 --> 6544.76
maybe even faster

6555.41 --> 6559.0599999999995
[Music]

6574.199 --> 6576.379999999999
thank you

6580.5 --> 6586.639
right anyway I thought it has been a

6583.44 --> 6586.638999999999
very interesting Hangout

6587.28 --> 6589.759999999999
done

6598.08 --> 6604.2699999999995
laughs

6601.03 --> 6604.2699999999995
[Music]

6610.65 --> 6618.219999999999
[Music]

6620.159 --> 6623.58
yeah the title is unfortunately a bit

6622.199 --> 6625.4
too big

6623.58 --> 6627.54
to include

6625.4 --> 6630.42
this subject

6627.54 --> 6632.88
but the Antarctic Maps

6630.42 --> 6636.92
but yeah I'm sure I'm gonna bring it up

6632.88 --> 6636.92
more in the future it's very interesting

6638.639 --> 6645.36
like stimulating in a way that just like

6641.88 --> 6646.86
I can it helps me to

6645.36 --> 6648.9
get

6646.86 --> 6651.96
yeah

6648.9 --> 6654.48
it's a good subject basically to expand

6651.96 --> 6656.58
upon and make you think about

6654.48 --> 6660.0599999999995
in the ways that I typically do it's

6656.58 --> 6662.04
very cosmogonically inspiring to think

6660.06 --> 6663.2390000000005
about like how is this working how is

6662.04 --> 6664.739
that working oh is there different

6663.239 --> 6667.259999999999
layers how is it work with the

6664.739 --> 6670.619
celestials because

6667.26 --> 6674.4800000000005
that's just what you do when you're

6670.619 --> 6674.48
cosmogenist and I do that

6674.58 --> 6680.159
so it's like oh what if it is

6677.699 --> 6682.32
a range like this well that has

6680.159 --> 6683.699
consequences everything must fit it's

6682.32 --> 6686.88
like

6683.699 --> 6688.86
a realm designer like a realm architect

6686.88 --> 6692.04
it's like yeah okay well if you want

6688.86 --> 6694.08
this it it will have to work so how

6692.04 --> 6696.119
could it be made to work right and that

6694.08 --> 6698.699
is a lot of the processing that I do

6696.119 --> 6701.94
when I think about it

6698.699 --> 6705.36
the Earth Realm how it works what's

6701.94 --> 6707.4
going on how big is it

6705.36 --> 6709.799999999999
how is it contained

6707.4 --> 6713.28
there are other compartments

6709.8 --> 6715.76
how the celestials work with all that

6713.28 --> 6715.759999999999
right

6715.92 --> 6720.46
anyway

6717.33 --> 6720.46
[Music]

6723.74 --> 6729.0599999999995
[Music]

6726.9 --> 6733.4
not always when things are censored it's

6729.06 --> 6733.400000000001
because it's true no no absolutely not

6733.739 --> 6739.0199999999995
uh censoring is is also a whole patty

6736.92 --> 6740.82
cake system by now

6739.02 --> 6745.26
right

6740.82 --> 6747.42
they like specifically censor people to

6745.26 --> 6750.179
emphasize what they said so it's almost

6747.42 --> 6752.9400000000005
like a controlled Streisand effect that

6750.179 --> 6755.52
they now are using with

6752.94 --> 6756.78
the guy that is banned

6755.52 --> 6759.900000000001
[Music]

6756.78 --> 6763.0199999999995
right it's just oh I'm banned oh really

6759.9 --> 6765.839999999999
so that's your advertisement then that's

6763.02 --> 6767.9400000000005
your calling card you're banned okay

6765.84 --> 6769.619000000001
well what are you talking about then

6767.94 --> 6770.82
would be the natural response right what

6769.619 --> 6773.839999999999
are you talking about that you're bad

6770.82 --> 6777.299999999999
all this and that and that Oh you mean

6773.84 --> 6781.5
the typically standard contrived

6777.3 --> 6784.46
political crap nonsense that's dumb

6781.5 --> 6784.46
oh okay

6788.88 --> 6793.1990000000005
now if somebody actually has something

6790.619 --> 6795.42
interesting to say and that gets banned

6793.199 --> 6797.159
well then the puppets are really dancing

6795.42 --> 6799.26
then things get interesting but yeah

6797.159 --> 6802.379999999999
there's people out there that say just

6799.26 --> 6804.3
horse crap it's not that interesting

6802.38 --> 6807.54
it's not even

6804.3 --> 6811.02
that antagonizing it's just dumb

6807.54 --> 6812.58
it's just basic Direction in a political

6811.02 --> 6816.6
way of thinking and then it gets

6812.58 --> 6817.86
censored and then I totally don't care

6816.6 --> 6822.54
it's like

6817.86 --> 6826.339999999999
you're just using I'm being censored as

6822.54 --> 6826.34
an advertisement strategy

6827.82 --> 6833.88
I mean I'm not gonna be more interested

6830.46 --> 6834.78
in you if you if you get banned for some

6833.88 --> 6837.9800000000005
reason

6834.78 --> 6837.98
when you're a dick

6838.86 --> 6842.659
or just an idiot

6852.11 --> 6856.0599999999995
[Music]

6856.139 --> 6860.52
and I don't mean

6857.82 --> 6863.82
a dick or an idiot on occasion because

6860.52 --> 6866.639
hey I am too I can be a dick on occasion

6863.82 --> 6870.48
I can be a bit of an idiot on occasion

6866.639 --> 6874.02
but I don't like systematically apply

6870.48 --> 6875.58
that form of adsc and dickishness that's

6874.02 --> 6878.6990000000005
the different I don't normalize it's

6875.58 --> 6880.86
just a part of my swing of the pendulum

6878.699 --> 6884.239
right

6880.86 --> 6884.239
well there's dicks

6884.52 --> 6889.320000000001
out there

6886.5 --> 6891.3
that do actually apply and they're

6889.32 --> 6893.58
Unapologetic and they're basically

6891.3 --> 6895.56
sinful and those people yeah they get

6893.58 --> 6897.659
censored and then they whine and

6895.56 --> 6899.52
complain about being censored and just

6897.659 --> 6901.5599999999995
be like Oh I'm gonna get even more

6899.52 --> 6904.139
aggressive then oh you're gonna get even

6901.56 --> 6906.360000000001
more [ __ ] okay

6904.139 --> 6910.32
so it's just like

6906.36 --> 6913.739
just a strategy just a 10 it's an aggro

6910.32 --> 6917.219
attention strategy basically

6913.739 --> 6921.44
and it sucks and those people suck and

6917.219 --> 6921.44
it's very very boring to me

6924.78 --> 6928.619
right

6927.119 --> 6930.54
but on the other hand if something

6928.619 --> 6932.88
somebody actually has something

6930.54 --> 6936.42
interesting to say and then they get

6932.88 --> 6938.1
canceled or banned or shamed then it's

6936.42 --> 6940.1990000000005
interesting because then you get the

6938.1 --> 6942.96
proper Streisand effect because they

6940.199 --> 6945.839999999999
actually had something to say

6942.96 --> 6947.52
but that's kind of rare now

6945.84 --> 6953.159000000001
I mean I think that like what happened

6947.52 --> 6955.679
with Ken Kanye or yay recently was

6953.159 --> 6958.199
interesting

6955.679 --> 6959.58
and it has a bit of a stress and effect

6958.199 --> 6961.619
now doesn't it

6959.58 --> 6964.44
because it's actually

6961.619 --> 6967.32
has a point it actually means something

6964.44 --> 6970.08
it's about something real and

6967.32 --> 6971.759999999999
and then he got canceled and censored

6970.08 --> 6973.38
for it

6971.76 --> 6975.84
well that has this tries in effect

6973.38 --> 6977.28
because everybody can wakes up from what

6975.84 --> 6979.679
he's saying and then it's like oh what

6977.28 --> 6983.4
is man that's not right

6979.679 --> 6986.88
or let's discuss this

6983.4 --> 6989.339999999999
but there's just asses out there

6986.88 --> 6991.1990000000005
that constantly get kicked off platforms

6989.34 --> 6993.06
but not because they had something

6991.199 --> 6995.5199999999995
meaningful to say

6993.06 --> 6999.56
really knows because they are carrying

6995.52 --> 6999.56
out just terrible tropes

7000.38 --> 7003.639
and they suck

7004.28 --> 7009.32
and then they get kicked off and then

7006.739 --> 7011.419999999999
they make it look like

7009.32 --> 7013.58
to the outside world to their followers

7011.42 --> 7016.6990000000005
like all they were being kicked out

7013.58 --> 7020.38
because they set such Noble things no

7016.699 --> 7020.379999999999
you were just a dick

7020.79 --> 7024.13
[Music]

7029.44 --> 7035.839999999999
right so yeah I always pay attention to

7033.32 --> 7037.759999999999
who's getting like who it actually is

7035.84 --> 7039.1990000000005
that is supposedly getting censored just

7037.76 --> 7042.619000000001
because she gets censored doesn't mean

7039.199 --> 7046.04
that you're subtly super meaningful

7042.619 --> 7049.5199999999995
a lot of them aren't they're just

7046.04 --> 7051.38
they're just using it as a covert form

7049.52 --> 7054.56
of advertisement

7051.38 --> 7055.9400000000005
and they're [ __ ] boring they have no

7054.56 --> 7058.099
point

7055.94 --> 7060.86
no real point

7058.099 --> 7064.219
now durable long-term point that

7060.86 --> 7065.659
actually addresses contemporary worldly

7064.219 --> 7068.0
issues

7065.659 --> 7070.219
that require addressing

7068.0 --> 7072.38
anyway I think I'm gonna round out the

7070.219 --> 7074.96
show

7072.38 --> 7077.84
