weather again

102.64 --> 110.399
very similar not entirely the same

106.32 --> 111.67999999999999
seems to be very hazy today but

110.399 --> 113.36
not

111.68 --> 116.56
necessarily

113.36 --> 119.2
hazy enough to prevent some sun from

116.56 --> 119.2
coming through

120.64 --> 124.96000000000001
and it's wind still

122.88 --> 128.64
so it's like this

124.96 --> 131.44
kind of hazy but sunny

128.64 --> 131.44
still day

133.68 --> 136.8
doesn't feel like summer heat out there

135.68 --> 140.92000000000002
but it is

136.8 --> 140.92000000000002
still kind of nice

143.44 --> 147.44
all right

145.2 --> 147.44
so

151.92 --> 154.92
okay

156.16 --> 158.48
all right

161.519 --> 165.76
hello return to normal first in chat

167.36 --> 172.64000000000001
look at me all on time yeah this is for

170.08 --> 172.64000000000001
a change

177.2 --> 180.23899999999998
hello lg

182.159 --> 188.84
it is friday the 17th of september 2021

188.959 --> 192.08
and

190.08 --> 195.44000000000003
that the feeling today show is going to

192.08 --> 197.519
be very different from yesterday's

195.44 --> 199.84
because

197.519 --> 204.0
like this night and the morning was just

199.84 --> 204.0
completely different in so many ways

207.76 --> 212.79899999999998
i didn't go to bed as early

210.159 --> 215.599
but not like overkill late

212.799 --> 217.76000000000002
but also yeah i i kind of messed up my

215.599 --> 220.64
food

217.76 --> 222.159
like i tried some replacement late

220.64 --> 226.76
dinner

222.159 --> 226.76
and that didn't turn out all that great

227.2 --> 232.319
basically overdid it with the

229.84 --> 234.799
hazelnut paste

232.319 --> 237.28
like because of the sugar in it and like

234.799 --> 241.59900000000002
my system had a serious problem with

237.28 --> 243.92
that as i was trying to get to sleep

241.599 --> 243.92
ugh

245.599 --> 250.72
like seriously this sugar

248.08 --> 251.68
i underestimated it and it was a real it

250.72 --> 253.599
was a

251.68 --> 254.56
palpable problem as i was trying to

253.599 --> 257.28
sleep

254.56 --> 259.84
it's almost like my like

257.28 --> 261.84
points of

259.84 --> 263.84
inflammation it's not inflammation it's

261.84 --> 268.03999999999996
just like the weak points everywhere

263.84 --> 268.03999999999996
suddenly started like yeah oh

269.919 --> 274.56
god

271.04 --> 274.56
not even five minutes in

275.759 --> 283.0
uh anyway

278.639 --> 283.0
i didn't dream at all

284.24 --> 289.68
or i i probably did dream i just was not

287.12 --> 292.0
lucid dude like my system just didn't

289.68 --> 295.28000000000003
allow that

292.0 --> 297.84
because of my mistakes see

295.28 --> 300.479
thereby you could like mechanically see

297.84 --> 303.19899999999996
it almost as a sin and

300.479 --> 307.4
well thinking about it sugar in there

303.199 --> 307.40000000000003
too late at night yeah

310.56 --> 315.039
right so yeah definitely not going to do

312.639 --> 316.96000000000004
that again

315.039 --> 320.96
and i should just

316.96 --> 323.28
get dinner in time and all that

320.96 --> 323.28
right

323.52 --> 327.68
hello cleary dutch sailor

331.28 --> 335.11999999999995
what did i think of pop the science guy

333.12 --> 337.68
oh god yes i

335.12 --> 340.56
i realized yesterday like after some

337.68 --> 342.72
premieres that apparently bob this heinz

340.56 --> 344.32
guy did actually get in the flat earth

342.72 --> 346.08000000000004
debates

344.32 --> 349.199
but i was

346.08 --> 351.52
out for groceries at that time

349.199 --> 353.36
and nobody like in the panel told me

351.52 --> 354.79999999999995
afterward

353.36 --> 356.8
they did talk about him but i didn't

354.8 --> 359.199
know he had just gotten on i was just

356.8 --> 361.6
thinking okay they're referencing that

359.199 --> 366.36
saturday situation

361.6 --> 366.36
he did actually come on there it was

367.28 --> 373.15999999999997
it was really

368.88 --> 373.15999999999997
embarrassing for bob

390.639 --> 395.40000000000003
uh hello there john m truth

405.6 --> 411.759
did bob get a pace pasting

409.52 --> 411.75899999999996
what

412.24 --> 415.919
what

413.44 --> 417.039
hey paste well he did get a nathan

415.919 --> 418.56
treatment but

417.039 --> 422.24
from what i heard it was pretty much

418.56 --> 424.319
nathan just asking one question bob not

422.24 --> 426.8
answering it

424.319 --> 428.96000000000004
asking like oh

426.8 --> 431.12
we should do that one time we should do

428.96 --> 433.52
that one time nathan like yeah you're

431.12 --> 436.759
right here right now

433.52 --> 436.75899999999996
do it

441.68 --> 446.16
this internet connection seriously

447.12 --> 454.16
yeah ilsg

448.84 --> 454.15999999999997
hello rest in peace nor mcdonald indeed

458.96 --> 465.84
yeah i just i was just watching

462.0 --> 469.44
on benjamin's replay of the uh

465.84 --> 471.84
celebrating nor mcdonald day

469.44 --> 473.199
watching like yeah some of his older

471.84 --> 474.15999999999997
clips

473.199 --> 476.0
and it's

474.16 --> 478.96000000000004
again i've already made a comment about

476.0 --> 482.879
it yesterday kind of kept it short

478.96 --> 485.68
it is just really impressive also i have

482.879 --> 490.0
very very distinct memories

485.68 --> 490.879
of having been confronted with it

490.0 --> 493.84
like

490.879 --> 495.59900000000005
a long time ago right because this guy

493.84 --> 498.31899999999996
was a comedian

495.599 --> 501.12
like even in the 80s

498.319 --> 501.12
and back then

501.52 --> 505.68
i felt really like

503.68 --> 508.0
weirded out by him

505.68 --> 510.16
because i just didn't get it i didn't

508.0 --> 512.88
get anything

510.16 --> 516.32
of what that really was

512.88 --> 518.88
like what hollywood was i had absolutely

516.32 --> 520.719
no idea i was totally

518.88 --> 523.599
ignorant of any of that

520.719 --> 525.44
and so like his actions were just really

523.599 --> 527.36
weirding me out

525.44 --> 531.0400000000001
back then i didn't actually think he was

527.36 --> 531.04
funny because i just didn't get it

531.519 --> 539.36
but it's aged very well the material

536.64 --> 543.12
it's very interesting

539.36 --> 547.04
this just has this really unique way of

543.12 --> 547.04
socially interacting and

547.44 --> 552.32
fine-tuning his

549.12 --> 554.5600000000001
comedic setups

552.32 --> 556.72
re yeah

554.56 --> 559.7199999999999
it's great and owen benjamin explains it

556.72 --> 559.72
perfectly

564.64 --> 568.88
uh

565.76 --> 568.88
hello tony whitcomb

569.519 --> 572.519
uh

578.68 --> 585.519
disgraceful nobody learned anything

582.24 --> 586.8
bob was muted was he muted level guy

585.519 --> 590.0
really

586.8 --> 591.5999999999999
was he muted

590.0 --> 594.399
now he was asked

591.6 --> 594.399
a question

594.48 --> 598.399
innumerable amount of times

599.36 --> 603.12
and bob just

600.8 --> 604.4799999999999
said oh let's

603.12 --> 609.6
do a show

604.48 --> 609.6
let's do when he was live right there

610.56 --> 616.4799999999999
it's not bob getting muted he just

613.279 --> 621.36
refused to address it

616.48 --> 621.36
in a very blatantly embarrassing way

624.48 --> 629.04
been having a hard time finding owen

627.04 --> 631.68
benjamin's live shows well he's supposed

629.04 --> 632.88
to have a new youtube channel i haven't

631.68 --> 635.12
really

632.88 --> 636.88
spotted it yet

635.12 --> 640.44
but i just keep following through him

636.88 --> 640.4399999999999
through bit shoot

649.12 --> 653.92
right ah thanks for the link return to

651.519 --> 653.92
normal

659.36 --> 663.6
right

660.959 --> 663.5999999999999
so anyway

667.97 --> 671.369
[Music]

679.2 --> 684.32
unlike yesterday i don't feel a big rush

681.68 --> 684.3199999999999
of energy

684.959 --> 689.68
because of my system basically getting

687.519 --> 691.92
clogged up

689.68 --> 692.88
and that's very distracting and it pulls

691.92 --> 694.88
away

692.88 --> 697.279
like the flow

694.88 --> 700.8
but i am

697.279 --> 700.8
not gonna let that repeat

701.519 --> 704.72
because i kind of do want that

703.92 --> 707.4399999999999
that

704.72 --> 708.399
flow back from yesterday it was it was

707.44 --> 711.519
great

708.399 --> 711.519
had some interesting

711.76 --> 716.48
micro revelations not anything that i'm

714.56 --> 719.8389999999999
gonna share here but

716.48 --> 722.32
learn some things about the roommate

719.839 --> 722.32
and uh

726.959 --> 731.8389999999999
yeah that also made a bit of a

729.2 --> 731.839
impact

738.0 --> 740.48
anyway

741.44 --> 745.36
oh yeah

742.639 --> 747.44
i just choose to keep that private i i

745.36 --> 748.5600000000001
don't know how to kind of express it in

747.44 --> 750.32
a

748.56 --> 753.3599999999999
proper way right now i don't have the

750.32 --> 755.7600000000001
energy if i did if i had that flow from

753.36 --> 757.6
yesterday i know i would just be able to

755.76 --> 760.88
perfectly roll it out

757.6 --> 763.2
so this is literally me just

760.88 --> 766.399
coming on stage

763.2 --> 766.399
with handcuffs on

766.88 --> 771.519
and i'm like yeah

769.36 --> 773.44
normally i use my hands

771.519 --> 774.72
but

773.44 --> 777.36
i

774.72 --> 778.8000000000001
was kind of weird mood yesterday put

777.36 --> 781.44
these on i don't know i could make it

778.8 --> 783.4399999999999
about a story about

781.44 --> 785.2
dating some crazy chick

783.44 --> 787.2790000000001
and then like yeah

785.2 --> 788.8000000000001
i lost the key

787.279 --> 790.32
i accidentally dropped them in the

788.8 --> 792.399
toilet and i flushed them and now i'm

790.32 --> 796.48
here handcuffed and i'm doing a live

792.399 --> 796.48
show this is kind of what it feels like

796.56 --> 801.92
like it's definitely my fault i fully

799.44 --> 801.9200000000001
admit it

802.24 --> 804.9590000000001
but i'm gonna

803.76 --> 808.0
use it

804.959 --> 808.0
to shame myself

808.16 --> 813.92
in order to encourage me

811.2 --> 817.44
keep like shape myself publicly so that

813.92 --> 820.639
i don't secretly forget about this [ __ ]

817.44 --> 823.44
and just continue being sloppy

820.639 --> 825.839
because i want that power back

823.44 --> 827.7600000000001
i felt it yesterday and i was like this

825.839 --> 829.839
is what it's what how it's supposed to

827.76 --> 829.8389999999999
be

830.48 --> 836.5600000000001
and i want it back and i will have it

833.199 --> 836.56
back quickly

837.12 --> 842.079
i'm gonna try to get it back tomorrow

839.76 --> 843.8389999999999
because i want control i want control of

842.079 --> 846.6389999999999
my power my

843.839 --> 849.0400000000001
my inherited power not some thing i'm

846.639 --> 852.32
wielding but me

849.04 --> 856.12
my natural born powers i want them and

852.32 --> 856.12
i'm not gonna let

856.48 --> 859.48
distractions

860.48 --> 865.04
and just

861.76 --> 866.8
sins take them away from me anymore i

865.04 --> 869.8
refuse

866.8 --> 869.8
huh

872.72 --> 877.839
yeah talking about which i was so super

875.12 --> 880.32
active yesterday it was crazy i was

877.839 --> 883.0400000000001
literally doing

880.32 --> 885.839
two streams at the same time

883.04 --> 888.0
literally

885.839 --> 890.32
mitchell from australia

888.0 --> 892.639
was he live yesterday

890.32 --> 894.9590000000001
think he was yeah that was later though

892.639 --> 899.44
but like good servant was life

894.959 --> 899.4399999999999
right during the fvd after aftershow

900.32 --> 904.32
which he always does typically

904.56 --> 908.959
and i was just

906.48 --> 910.8000000000001
double wielding it like i could do that

908.959 --> 912.7199999999999
and i didn't have any concentration

910.8 --> 914.399
problems i was active in the chat and

912.72 --> 915.6800000000001
listening to good servant and at the

914.399 --> 916.88
same time

915.68 --> 919.199
sometimes

916.88 --> 920.16
putting in a mute sometimes just letting

919.199 --> 922.3199999999999
both

920.16 --> 924.8389999999999
two conversations at the same time had

922.32 --> 928.399
no problem following it

924.839 --> 931.44
whatsoever and then commenting on one

928.399 --> 933.36
and then suddenly muting it unmuting and

931.44 --> 935.2790000000001
actually because i was on the panel

933.36 --> 937.12
saying something

935.279 --> 939.199
and it was relevant and it rolled out

937.12 --> 942.5600000000001
great like

939.199 --> 945.7589999999999
i can do that if i just don't

942.56 --> 948.7199999999999
mess myself up

945.759 --> 951.759
and i'm really putting it like see this

948.72 --> 954.9590000000001
see what i did wrong

951.759 --> 958.24
world out there and maybe if the entire

954.959 --> 962.079
world looks like that at me

958.24 --> 965.6
then i cannot look at the world and

962.079 --> 967.7589999999999
see past it i cannot let it

965.6 --> 970.399
out of my sight again so i'm putting it

967.759 --> 972.9590000000001
out there because i want it back i want

970.399 --> 972.959
it back

973.279 --> 978.16
and i will have it

976.32 --> 979.44
and i can be a little bit loud because

978.16 --> 982.079
the roommate

979.44 --> 982.0790000000001
went home

986.639 --> 991.04
dude i cleaned up like the entire

989.199 --> 992.4799999999999
freaking shower

991.04 --> 994.24
in the hallway

992.48 --> 997.6800000000001
just in the middle of everything

994.24 --> 999.839
yesterday too nobody asked i just did it

997.68 --> 1002.4799999999999
like i had so much energy it was

999.839 --> 1007.2790000000001
unbelievable

1002.48 --> 1007.279
well it wasn't i shouldn't even say that

1007.36 --> 1011.44
it's not unbelievable that's normal

1010.399 --> 1013.04
that's

1011.44 --> 1016.1600000000001
normal

1013.04 --> 1016.16
and i want it back

1016.48 --> 1022.0
it's normal i'm gonna be like that and

1018.959 --> 1023.279
i'm gonna stay like that until i buckle

1022.0 --> 1026.24
and die

1023.279 --> 1030.319
i will never relinquish that level of

1026.24 --> 1030.319
power again knowingly

1034.559 --> 1041.28
that is what i am

1036.959 --> 1041.28
that is what i can do and i will have it

1042.4 --> 1047.439
everything went great yesterday like all

1044.72 --> 1048.48
social interactions went great

1047.439 --> 1050.0800000000002
super

1048.48 --> 1052.4
great

1050.08 --> 1055.76
so much confidence so much energy it

1052.4 --> 1057.679
didn't did barely even have to focus

1055.76 --> 1060.64
and everything rolled

1057.679 --> 1061.6000000000001
i want it i will have it and i will

1060.64 --> 1064.0
never

1061.6 --> 1066.799
knowingly let it go

1064.0 --> 1069.039
although it might get a little torturous

1066.799 --> 1070.96
because that is a weird side that is the

1069.039 --> 1072.16
thing that distracts me

1070.96 --> 1074.72
because

1072.16 --> 1078.0
it burns

1074.72 --> 1080.799
but it doesn't burn with depressing

1078.0 --> 1084.0
depressing mystery misery

1080.799 --> 1085.6
it burns with like this

1084.0 --> 1089.36
almost like

1085.6 --> 1089.36
freaky bubbly feeling

1092.64 --> 1098.64
and you kind of like wanna or i what i

1096.08 --> 1100.96
knowingly experienced about it

1098.64 --> 1102.0800000000002
at some point i wanted to rest i just

1100.96 --> 1104.64
wanted to

1102.08 --> 1106.3999999999999
can you just stop

1104.64 --> 1108.5590000000002
being part of my consciousness now i

1106.4 --> 1110.3200000000002
want some peace of mind

1108.559 --> 1112.8799999999999
that is a thing

1110.32 --> 1115.6
that is the thing about it

1112.88 --> 1118.5590000000002
so maybe i have to slightly retract and

1115.6 --> 1120.559
just realize like i might not be able to

1118.559 --> 1123.44
continually handle it

1120.559 --> 1126.24
but it certainly built the skills

1123.44 --> 1129.6000000000001
in order to attempt doing that again

1126.24 --> 1131.039
because i have attempted it in the past

1129.6 --> 1132.0
and then

1131.039 --> 1134.84
yeah

1132.0 --> 1139.44
couldn't handle it

1134.84 --> 1141.9189999999999
obviously a much worse backlash

1139.44 --> 1144.0
because it brews my ego that i wasn't

1141.919 --> 1145.6000000000001
able to handle it it makes me feel

1144.0 --> 1150.16
incompetent

1145.6 --> 1152.799
and that is in a way what it is

1150.16 --> 1155.3600000000001
can just be brutally honest with myself

1152.799 --> 1157.6
because i want it and i can

1155.36 --> 1158.4799999999998
see

1157.6 --> 1162.84
norm

1158.48 --> 1164.4
and i dare not really compare myself

1162.84 --> 1166.3999999999999
really

1164.4 --> 1171.679
but maybe in a

1166.4 --> 1172.799
spirit way i can he had this unique

1171.679 --> 1175.52
freedom

1172.799 --> 1176.6399999999999
defiance

1175.52 --> 1179.36
and i

1176.64 --> 1181.8400000000001
in my own way not i don't know if it's

1179.36 --> 1183.6789999999999
in a comedic way i don't think so at all

1181.84 --> 1185.6
but i do have that

1183.679 --> 1187.919
i do have like

1185.6 --> 1190.0
oh this wouldn't be very socially

1187.919 --> 1193.039
tactical

1190.0 --> 1197.28
but i'm gonna [ __ ] do it anyway

1193.039 --> 1197.28
i'm gonna do it i'm gonna because

1197.6 --> 1201.1999999999998
my

1198.64 --> 1204.88
personal cohesion

1201.2 --> 1207.44
is more important to me than what people

1204.88 --> 1210.64
out there think of me and if they can

1207.44 --> 1214.0
fit me on some kind of pedestal in their

1210.64 --> 1214.0
mind collection

1215.76 --> 1220.4
i am

1218.48 --> 1222.4
the bowling ball that's being thrown

1220.4 --> 1226.24
through the window

1222.4 --> 1226.24
that's what i am that's what i can do

1226.64 --> 1231.8400000000001
sometimes i wonder like why right why

1229.6 --> 1231.84
why

1233.52 --> 1238.48
but it's

1235.6 --> 1240.8799999999999
it's something i can do

1238.48 --> 1243.52
and we'll just see where it goes

1240.88 --> 1248.2
maybe this is all a comedy it's just

1243.52 --> 1248.2
that i haven't caught on to it yet

1248.64 --> 1253.1200000000001
some people have told me that i am

1251.2 --> 1254.799
extremely funny

1253.12 --> 1256.3999999999999
it's just that

1254.799 --> 1258.6399999999999
i never really

1256.4 --> 1260.24
believed them i was just like

1258.64 --> 1262.72
why

1260.24 --> 1264.88
and i guess that even feeling like that

1262.72 --> 1268.159
and responding like that in its way is

1264.88 --> 1268.159
kind of funny in the moment

1269.76 --> 1273.6
to them

1270.88 --> 1275.5200000000002
maybe it only really works face to face

1273.6 --> 1278.24
because i got that kind of

1275.52 --> 1281.6
commentary from people in when i had a

1278.24 --> 1283.44
lot more face-to-face contact before

1281.6 --> 1287.1589999999999
the internet

1283.44 --> 1287.159
before the hive

1290.0 --> 1294.32
which is a very different way for me to

1292.0 --> 1295.52
communicate it's very different but it

1294.32 --> 1299.4399999999998
is me

1295.52 --> 1302.24
it's just another part of me that is

1299.44 --> 1304.799
logically consistent and fits right next

1302.24 --> 1306.88
to the face-to-face communication thing

1304.799 --> 1308.96
which has a different spectrum and a

1306.88 --> 1310.96
different depth

1308.96 --> 1313.6000000000001
different energy management

1310.96 --> 1315.679
and being hyper analytical

1313.6 --> 1317.52
i guess i do have power

1315.679 --> 1320.88
now that i just claimed it

1317.52 --> 1324.72
even weirdly enough

1320.88 --> 1324.72
there's a physical response

1326.88 --> 1331.44
it's almost like i

1328.799 --> 1333.039
kind of forced it

1331.44 --> 1336.4
through energy

1333.039 --> 1338.559
that's weird did i just dispel my own

1336.4 --> 1342.88
bad condition

1338.559 --> 1342.8799999999999
did i i really feel like i did

1344.64 --> 1349.44
i don't know you be the judge of it i

1346.559 --> 1351.28
just suddenly feel a lot less like

1349.44 --> 1353.919
i'm like sort of

1351.28 --> 1357.2
holding myself together now now i'm like

1353.919 --> 1357.2
oh hey yeah wow

1357.76 --> 1362.08
this

1358.84 --> 1363.1999999999998
is maybe

1362.08 --> 1366.1589999999999
50

1363.2 --> 1368.559
of what i had yesterday it's pretty good

1366.159 --> 1371.8400000000001
it's good enough for now but i'm gonna

1368.559 --> 1371.84
try to get it all back

1372.84 --> 1377.9189999999999
right of course yesterday i spent like

1376.32 --> 1380.48
half an hour

1377.919 --> 1382.64
very inspiredly

1380.48 --> 1386.4
getting things together i didn't do that

1382.64 --> 1389.039
this time i just have my typical

1386.4 --> 1391.2
occupations to reflect upon what did i

1389.039 --> 1394.8799999999999
watch and of course hey

1391.2 --> 1399.3600000000001
no norm own benjamin good material and

1394.88 --> 1399.3600000000001
flat earth debates bob science guy

1400.72 --> 1406.64
good material

1402.799 --> 1406.6399999999999
this is kind of a clown show

1408.4 --> 1413.3600000000001
from the baller side that is of course

1411.679 --> 1416.4
but

1413.36 --> 1418.799
it's not very intellectually stimulating

1416.4 --> 1421.44
it is it is kind of like funny and

1418.799 --> 1423.76
encouraging for like yeah we are holding

1421.44 --> 1425.039
on and those who oppose us are complete

1423.76 --> 1426.24
lunatics

1425.039 --> 1430.44
right

1426.24 --> 1430.44
they're just gaslighting themselves

1431.36 --> 1436.7199999999998
oh yeah i also completely

1434.88 --> 1439.3600000000001
followed brandon's live stream in the

1436.72 --> 1441.2
background while playing a game

1439.36 --> 1444.559
and that's how i completely lost track

1441.2 --> 1447.3600000000001
of time and a too late thanks brandon

1444.559 --> 1450.3999999999999
no it's not your fault brandon

1447.36 --> 1453.84
these shows are very entertaining

1450.4 --> 1454.88
a little chaotic sometimes

1453.84 --> 1456.1589999999999
like

1454.88 --> 1458.96
various

1456.159 --> 1461.679
levels of intellectual input

1458.96 --> 1464.4
like from the worst to

1461.679 --> 1464.4
pretty decent

1465.52 --> 1473.0
like one and the other one in the other

1468.24 --> 1473.0
it is chaos but it is still interesting

1474.24 --> 1479.2
george nietzsche was on there just being

1476.559 --> 1481.6
complete [ __ ] like

1479.2 --> 1483.3600000000001
that guy is so bad man

1481.6 --> 1484.24
like he's so

1483.36 --> 1486.8799999999999
like

1484.24 --> 1489.2
if he makes a mistake he's too proud to

1486.88 --> 1491.44
admit it like he can't even just admit

1489.2 --> 1492.799
making a mistake and then he just like

1491.44 --> 1495.44
really

1492.799 --> 1499.679
like in your face not even backs in your

1495.44 --> 1502.559
he backstabs you to the face like

1499.679 --> 1506.0
in plain sight he backs like really

1502.559 --> 1507.36
nasty the guy is [ __ ] demon goblin

1506.0 --> 1510.24
guys

1507.36 --> 1512.7199999999998
he backstabs you

1510.24 --> 1515.1200000000001
in plain sight

1512.72 --> 1516.96
ugh

1515.12 --> 1520.7199999999998
fell asleep last night okay i got you

1516.96 --> 1520.72
inspector i didn't have that issue

1521.039 --> 1526.84
like them all rumpus is this yeah but

1523.279 --> 1530.799
rumpus doesn't do it success

1526.84 --> 1530.799
successfully he's not

1530.88 --> 1537.0390000000002
he just gets kind of wobbly he does

1534.559 --> 1540.1589999999999
he and yeah he backstabs you to the face

1537.039 --> 1540.1589999999999
but it's like with him

1541.279 --> 1545.2
maybe you're right

1543.279 --> 1546.159
maybe he is on the same level it is

1545.2 --> 1548.0
certainly

1546.159 --> 1550.24
the same kind of response tactics but i

1548.0 --> 1553.039
don't know with rumpus i just think it's

1550.24 --> 1557.36
funny i can't help it with george it's

1553.039 --> 1558.799
just like a nasty nasty old man

1557.36 --> 1561.12
just like ugh

1558.799 --> 1562.08
a rumpus it's just like haha look at the

1561.12 --> 1564.2399999999998
nerd

1562.08 --> 1567.52
going completely apeshit

1564.24 --> 1570.08
it's funnier i can't i don't know why

1567.52 --> 1571.9189999999999
i don't know why i think rompus is funny

1570.08 --> 1575.279
and the others aren't so much i don't

1571.919 --> 1575.279
know why i just do

1582.88 --> 1588.24
okay pj crew shack

1585.84 --> 1588.24
all right

1589.039 --> 1593.44
it is a bunch of chaos so if

1591.52 --> 1595.84
there's not a lot to really actively

1593.44 --> 1598.48
focus on but if you do other things at

1595.84 --> 1600.24
the same time it works great

1598.48 --> 1602.96
pj khrushchev

1600.24 --> 1605.84
is rumpus autistic

1602.96 --> 1607.44
he probably is on the spectrum yes but

1605.84 --> 1609.1999999999998
he also

1607.44 --> 1611.679
has well

1609.2 --> 1613.279
depending on the context advantages from

1611.679 --> 1615.679
it

1613.279 --> 1615.679
he is

1616.08 --> 1619.279
constructive with it

1619.919 --> 1623.76
but yeah that's

1621.52 --> 1626.72
only to his own personal journey's

1623.76 --> 1629.84
detriment at this point

1626.72 --> 1631.52
because he uses it to also fool himself

1629.84 --> 1633.76
that's just messed up

1631.52 --> 1635.44
anyway

1633.76 --> 1639.24
pain in the ass but entertaining at the

1635.44 --> 1639.24
center right exactly

1643.52 --> 1646.32
all right anyway

1647.039 --> 1651.44
in reality guys these people are

1651.6 --> 1657.279
distracting

1652.84 --> 1657.279
clowns they they really are

1661.6 --> 1667.6789999999999
if you had to be honest with yourself it

1664.48 --> 1671.52
would be much more productive

1667.679 --> 1673.76
to try and engage with a

1671.52 --> 1676.799
a constructive and inspiring

1673.76 --> 1679.44
conversation and you can literally just

1676.799 --> 1681.12
start it up just be defined and just

1679.44 --> 1685.44
attempt it

1681.12 --> 1685.4399999999998
with people that you actually care about

1686.159 --> 1688.88
close ones

1689.84 --> 1694.48
right or somebody in the neighborhood

1692.0 --> 1697.6
that you're curious about

1694.48 --> 1701.52
and i'm absolutely projecting this on

1697.6 --> 1704.8799999999999
you because i am like not easy to do

1701.52 --> 1706.799
that normally but

1704.88 --> 1709.0390000000002
yesterday

1706.799 --> 1712.96
no problem

1709.039 --> 1714.559
right so if that is a matter of energy

1712.96 --> 1716.159
in a way to me

1714.559 --> 1718.6399999999999
i don't know if that's the works the

1716.159 --> 1722.24
same with everybody else but to me

1718.64 --> 1724.96
like it's a massive difference

1722.24 --> 1726.559
and when i feel high energy like

1724.96 --> 1729.2
the clowns

1726.559 --> 1731.44
they just don't do it for me

1729.2 --> 1734.559
it's not

1731.44 --> 1736.96
satisfying because literally nothing is

1734.559 --> 1740.96
learned i know everything there is to

1736.96 --> 1743.039
know about their mindset i can simulate

1740.96 --> 1745.6000000000001
all each individual

1743.039 --> 1746.72
mind of what they do and what they think

1745.6 --> 1749.9189999999999
they know

1746.72 --> 1752.72
and could simulate it all in just a tiny

1749.919 --> 1755.679
little corner of my mind their entire

1752.72 --> 1757.679
personalities

1755.679 --> 1760.799
what else is there to learn you know

1757.679 --> 1762.88
they are not going to help build the

1760.799 --> 1765.279
intellectual heritage we are all

1762.88 --> 1765.279
building

1765.76 --> 1770.399
they're only trying to obstruct it

1768.159 --> 1773.0390000000002
their own the only function they really

1770.399 --> 1777.039
have is point at where we're right

1773.039 --> 1779.52
because they directly oppose it

1777.039 --> 1781.679
if they go with something then you have

1779.52 --> 1785.279
to be careful because that means you

1781.679 --> 1785.279
might be mistaken about something

1785.6 --> 1790.8799999999999
yes they are utterly predictable and

1788.64 --> 1793.44
systematic

1790.88 --> 1794.48
including in social maneuvers

1793.44 --> 1798.0800000000002
absolutely

1794.48 --> 1798.08
systematic like a robot

1799.6 --> 1803.52
to get a little nutty they could

1801.84 --> 1806.48
die

1803.52 --> 1808.32
be reanimated with a freaking ai chip in

1806.48 --> 1809.76
their head and you wouldn't be able to

1808.32 --> 1813.279
tell the difference

1809.76 --> 1814.559
if the programmer of that chip knew them

1813.279 --> 1817.2
you wouldn't be able to tell the

1814.559 --> 1819.2
difference because they always stay the

1817.2 --> 1821.76
same they always respond the same

1819.2 --> 1824.48
they're not dynamic they don't actually

1821.76 --> 1827.84
grow anymore they're stuck

1824.48 --> 1830.08
in their own little devious program

1827.84 --> 1832.8799999999999
that takes up all the energy

1830.08 --> 1834.96
and disables them from exiting that

1832.88 --> 1837.8400000000001
program that's where they're at it's

1834.96 --> 1840.0
their own self-made hell and that is the

1837.84 --> 1842.1589999999999
only way hell is

1840.0 --> 1844.48
you make it yourself

1842.159 --> 1847.5200000000002
and then you burn in it

1844.48 --> 1849.52
during your life in your mind

1847.52 --> 1852.72
that's how it works that's the real hell

1849.52 --> 1855.039
that's the provable palpable hell that

1852.72 --> 1857.279
actually haunts you

1855.039 --> 1857.279
right

1862.48 --> 1865.84
thank you cleary

1884.88 --> 1891.5590000000002
what the hell areas

1887.679 --> 1891.5590000000002
you blabbering about

1899.279 --> 1905.64
oh god

1900.72 --> 1905.64
yeah george sound i don't give a [ __ ]

1909.039 --> 1912.039
ugh

1924.159 --> 1929.3600000000001
but yeah thanks for sharing that

1926.0 --> 1932.919
miserable factoid there george sanford

1929.36 --> 1932.9189999999999
that's just great

1967.76 --> 1974.519
yeah well george sanford have you ever

1969.679 --> 1974.519
considered that it might be a scam

1976.159 --> 1978.3990000000001
right

1980.24 --> 1983.279
might be

1981.36 --> 1984.1589999999999
might have been because it was forced on

1983.279 --> 1987.76
a

1984.159 --> 1989.6000000000001
huge population forced like oh is that

1987.76 --> 1991.679
sold is it sold

1989.6 --> 1994.6399999999999
when the government says hey you buy

1991.679 --> 1997.3600000000001
this book or you go to [ __ ] prison is

1994.64 --> 2000.3600000000001
that selling

1997.36 --> 2000.36
huh

2006.0 --> 2009.039
ah anyway

2013.519 --> 2019.84
the second most popular book is the gran

2016.48 --> 2023.3600000000001

a lot of it

2038.799 --> 2041.36
what the hell

2044.84 --> 2049.679
uh

2046.799 --> 2049.679
imitation

2053.76 --> 2059.9190000000003
i i don't even sorry i i feel ignorant

2058.24 --> 2061.839
but it's not ignorant i haven't ignored

2059.919 --> 2063.359
it i just don't know what those things

2061.839 --> 2065.119
are

2063.359 --> 2067.119
aries

2065.119 --> 2070.839
hey ares 106

2067.119 --> 2070.839
my favorite ares

2082.56 --> 2085.52
what

2084.72 --> 2089.48
like

2085.52 --> 2089.48
what are you talking about

2100.72 --> 2106.64
four is lord of the rings awesome

2103.119 --> 2108.2400000000002
well good good on on him man because it

2106.64 --> 2110.4
is

2108.24 --> 2112.16
epic

2110.4 --> 2114.1600000000003
it's it's the only

2112.16 --> 2116.3999999999996
it's so funny in a way you know it is

2114.16 --> 2118.16
the only book that i ever like really

2116.4 --> 2119.92
voluntary like i

2118.16 --> 2123.2
i wanted

2119.92 --> 2125.599
it i wanted to read it myself it's the

2123.2 --> 2126.96
first book ever that i just wanted to

2125.599 --> 2130.76
read

2126.96 --> 2130.76
from beginning to end

2131.359 --> 2135.44
and

2133.2 --> 2137.359
to be fair the only book

2135.44 --> 2139.359
with which i done that i have other

2137.359 --> 2142.0789999999997
books

2139.359 --> 2145.72
but i just don't really read it from

2142.079 --> 2145.7200000000003
beginning to end

2145.839 --> 2149.92
but with that one

2147.44 --> 2152.4
well i kind of forced myself into it in

2149.92 --> 2153.6800000000003
a way by going on vacation taking that

2152.4 --> 2155.599
book with me

2153.68 --> 2157.52
and of course on vacation back then i

2155.599 --> 2159.44
didn't have a computer

2157.52 --> 2161.68
with me

2159.44 --> 2163.839
so i just like okay

2161.68 --> 2165.52
on the beach

2163.839 --> 2167.359
the parasol

2165.52 --> 2169.119
to read it

2167.359 --> 2170.72
i have some good

2169.119 --> 2173.119
lunch

2170.72 --> 2174.8799999999997
some sleep some

2173.119 --> 2176.56
beach

2174.88 --> 2179.6800000000003
beach going

2176.56 --> 2183.44
and read it and just did that the entire

2179.68 --> 2185.1189999999997
holiday so i wrote the whole thing in

2183.44 --> 2187.599
in two weeks

2185.119 --> 2190.6400000000003
which was pretty quickly for me because

2187.599 --> 2193.2000000000003
i've never been a quick reader

2190.64 --> 2196.0789999999997
and i it like it was like read it read

2193.2 --> 2199.4399999999996
it again read it again like i really

2196.079 --> 2201.28
wanted to see it i wanted to see because

2199.44 --> 2205.52
tolkien especially in the elaborate

2201.28 --> 2207.92
versions is so descriptive he's so

2205.52 --> 2210.56
detailing the visuals

2207.92 --> 2211.7200000000003
it's like must have been pretty tough

2210.56 --> 2213.44
even for the

2211.72 --> 2216.3199999999997
[Music]

2213.44 --> 2218.32
what is it well the the movie makers i

2216.32 --> 2220.6400000000003
don't know the names i'm very

2218.32 --> 2224.0
incompetent name wise when it comes to

2220.64 --> 2224.0
the hollywood related things

2224.16 --> 2228.64
uh

2225.839 --> 2229.599
but the lord of the rings movies

2228.64 --> 2231.2
like

2229.599 --> 2233.3590000000004
they are burdened

2231.2 --> 2237.04
by the specificities

2233.359 --> 2239.44
of tolkien's descriptions of everything

2237.04 --> 2243.599
like there's little interpretation that

2239.44 --> 2246.7200000000003
he leaves to the imagination with things

2243.599 --> 2247.839
and i wanted that i wanted to see the

2246.72 --> 2250.16
movie

2247.839 --> 2252.24
in my mind

2250.16 --> 2254.0789999999997
from the book and that was yeah peter

2252.24 --> 2256.7999999999997
jackson that's the one yeah

2254.079 --> 2258.96
before

2256.8 --> 2261.119
yeah before anything else because i

2258.96 --> 2264.32
realized yeah probably one day there is

2261.119 --> 2265.28
going to be a movie made about it

2264.32 --> 2267.52
but

2265.28 --> 2268.8390000000004
i wanted to experience it in my mind

2267.52 --> 2272.32
because

2268.839 --> 2274.64
then there's more room for

2272.32 --> 2277.119
spirit things for energy things for

2274.64 --> 2278.7999999999997
mystical things that are also part of

2277.119 --> 2281.119
that

2278.8 --> 2281.119
world

2282.0 --> 2287.839
and i really tuned into that still do

2285.52 --> 2290.48
and yeah some of those details are kind

2287.839 --> 2292.24
of lost to the movie although not all of

2290.48 --> 2294.64
it but still

2292.24 --> 2297.359
you probably understand what i mean

2294.64 --> 2299.1189999999997
because tolkien had so much detail and

2297.359 --> 2301.92
subtlety

2299.119 --> 2301.92
to his works

2303.119 --> 2309.2000000000003
and it is made for reading

2306.96 --> 2312.0
like the way he does things that doesn't

2309.2 --> 2314.0
really actually work if you do it

2312.0 --> 2316.48
literally like that in move it doesn't

2314.0 --> 2318.32
work it's not supposed to be like that

2316.48 --> 2319.92
it's supposed to be

2318.32 --> 2321.92
a person

2319.92 --> 2324.32
being a bystander

2321.92 --> 2327.04
two individuals meet and then you look

2324.32 --> 2329.52
at like oh what is he wearing right in a

2327.04 --> 2331.2799999999997
movie that makes no freaking sense

2329.52 --> 2333.2
but if you're reading it then it's

2331.28 --> 2335.0400000000004
really almost like you're a bystander

2333.2 --> 2337.2
and you see

2335.04 --> 2339.7599999999998
it being described in detail and that is

2337.2 --> 2341.7599999999998
a really unique kind of experience if

2339.76 --> 2344.96
you don't get bored

2341.76 --> 2347.92
right a lot of people got bored by it

2344.96 --> 2350.16
i in the first book got a little bored

2347.92 --> 2352.4
but i ran through it and then as soon as

2350.16 --> 2355.5989999999997
i hit that second book there was no more

2352.4 --> 2359.44
issue at all and was totally captured

2355.599 --> 2361.839
couldn't stop reading could barely sleep

2359.44 --> 2361.839
anyway

2362.32 --> 2365.32
uh

2383.599 --> 2388.4
okay aries

2386.0 --> 2388.4
sure

2392.4 --> 2398.1600000000003
so oh it's oh

2394.8 --> 2398.1600000000003
are you saying that if you don't

2398.48 --> 2403.839
use those books that you're

2401.119 --> 2405.52
that you're missing out on an essential

2403.839 --> 2408.0789999999997
christian life

2405.52 --> 2408.079
like what

2409.839 --> 2412.16
how

2415.92 --> 2420.16
i mean there might be interesting

2418.24 --> 2421.68
things in there

2420.16 --> 2423.52
sure of it

2421.68 --> 2425.839
but

2423.52 --> 2427.04
i'll just trust on my own

2425.839 --> 2429.2
systems

2427.04 --> 2431.2799999999997
my own conclusions

2429.2 --> 2433.9199999999996
really

2431.28 --> 2434.96
da vinci code was good really you think

2433.92 --> 2437.6800000000003
so

2434.96 --> 2440.48
they help oh well thanks

2437.68 --> 2440.48
thanks for the help

2441.119 --> 2444.96
i mean if every anybody would

2445.44 --> 2449.2000000000003
you could send

2446.96 --> 2451.119
books to me right i'm not

2449.2 --> 2453.7599999999998
otherwise i'm just not gonna

2451.119 --> 2455.28
engage just be very blatantly honest

2453.76 --> 2459.0400000000004
about it

2455.28 --> 2462.7200000000003
i'm not much of a book guy universally

2459.04 --> 2462.72
universally all right

2462.8 --> 2466.7200000000003
but if you really think they're very

2465.119 --> 2470.56
worthwhile

2466.72 --> 2473.7599999999998
then you could choose to send them to me

2470.56 --> 2475.839
and who knows i might take a peek

2473.76 --> 2478.079
and then whatever

2475.839 --> 2479.04
conclusion i will draw i will draw from

2478.079 --> 2481.04
them

2479.04 --> 2482.96
might actually think that you might be a

2481.04 --> 2485.359
little bit full of [ __ ] for example and

2482.96 --> 2487.359
then i will tell you that

2485.359 --> 2489.2
if i have some criticism about it but

2487.359 --> 2492.5989999999997
who knows maybe they are actually kind

2489.2 --> 2492.5989999999997
of cool

2495.68 --> 2498.7999999999997
was a good story

2500.319 --> 2502.72
really

2505.44 --> 2510.4
i guess it could be worse i have never

2508.0 --> 2513.2
read the books i've only seen the movie

2510.4 --> 2514.7200000000003
and that's that's i know well by my own

2513.2 --> 2516.48
explanation i understand that's

2514.72 --> 2519.2799999999997
problematic

2516.48 --> 2519.28
but again i

2519.52 --> 2523.8
i don't read books

2526.0 --> 2528.72
i just don't

2534.4 --> 2539.44
but hey if somebody shoves them in my

2536.319 --> 2539.44
face i might take a look

2543.52 --> 2547.2
how do i do that well you just send them

2545.839 --> 2549.44
to me i don't know how you're gonna do

2547.2 --> 2549.4399999999996
that

2549.76 --> 2554.6400000000003
give you my address if you contact me on

2552.24 --> 2554.64
skype

2556.88 --> 2560.88
or you could

2558.4 --> 2564.119
email me and then i'll give my address

2560.88 --> 2564.119
through that

2564.16 --> 2570.0
but i prefer contact on skype because

2566.319 --> 2570.0
then i can make sure it's actually you

2570.8 --> 2575.2000000000003
100 pages okay

2572.88 --> 2575.2000000000003
fine

2577.28 --> 2582.3190000000004
but you you got to understand that i'm

2579.04 --> 2584.88
going to be really suspicious of that

2582.319 --> 2586.48
you understand right i mean if there is

2584.88 --> 2589.6800000000003
anything in there that's going to

2586.48 --> 2593.359
reference to the importance of christ's

2589.68 --> 2594.72
death or the supposed forgiveness of all

2593.359 --> 2597.359
sins

2594.72 --> 2598.7999999999997
without repentance

2597.359 --> 2601.2
yeah

2598.8 --> 2604.2400000000002
without like really making that obvious

2601.2 --> 2607.24
i'm gonna be extremely critical

2604.24 --> 2607.24
so

2608.16 --> 2612.56
the book was a page turner all right

2611.2 --> 2613.9199999999996
okay

2612.56 --> 2616.24
i'll have to take your word on that

2613.92 --> 2617.92
gadget inspector i have heard similar

2616.24 --> 2621.64
things in the past it just wasn't

2617.92 --> 2621.64
interested at all

2626.24 --> 2632.9199999999996
all right curry aries fine cool

2629.76 --> 2632.92
who knows

2636.56 --> 2640.0789999999997
brave new world

2638.16 --> 2643.2
yeah i have actually read that jason

2640.079 --> 2645.599
brown but that's because i read it for

2643.2 --> 2645.5989999999997
school

2645.92 --> 2651.839
i did for my english

2648.96 --> 2651.839
i did great

2653.839 --> 2656.56
i aced it

2657.04 --> 2662.599
and i thought it was a very interesting

2659.599 --> 2662.599
read

2666.4 --> 2671.6800000000003
in a weird way i actually thought it was

2669.44 --> 2673.68
kind of appealing

2671.68 --> 2675.839
which is like in retrospect really

2673.68 --> 2677.5989999999997
creeping me out like oh [ __ ] i actually

2675.839 --> 2679.92
thought that might be halfway a good

2677.599 --> 2682.1600000000003
idea now of course i know that's like oh

2679.92 --> 2683.52
[ __ ]

2682.16 --> 2684.7999999999997
but also

2683.52 --> 2686.72
even back then

2684.8 --> 2688.1600000000003
it really did stood out to me in that

2686.72 --> 2690.3999999999996
little book

2688.16 --> 2692.16
the contrast with the the people i don't

2690.4 --> 2694.64
remember the name but the people that

2692.16 --> 2696.48
were basically not part of the system

2694.64 --> 2697.2
and that they were just allowed to do

2696.48 --> 2700.319
that

2697.2 --> 2704.0789999999997
and that they had their own culture

2700.319 --> 2707.2
very different that was very interesting

2704.079 --> 2707.2000000000003
i thought it was a good book

2707.599 --> 2711.92
but yeah

2708.8 --> 2712.96
i i read it for school

2711.92 --> 2715.839
right

2712.96 --> 2716.96
i have read books for school i just

2715.839 --> 2719.599
don't

2716.96 --> 2721.76
like on my own volition

2719.599 --> 2723.839
typically get a book and then read it

2721.76 --> 2726.88
i'm not like that

2723.839 --> 2729.44
everybody else in my family was

2726.88 --> 2732.48
i am not

2729.44 --> 2734.25
had to be the one bought out the odd one

2732.48 --> 2737.389
out like that

2734.25 --> 2737.389
[Music]

2754.4 --> 2760.079
okay aries 106. that's a funny one

2758.24 --> 2762.64
i feel like brave new world can be

2760.079 --> 2764.7200000000003
summed up as a dystopian sci-fi version

2762.64 --> 2766.24
of get off my lawn

2764.72 --> 2768.9599999999996
yeah

2766.24 --> 2768.9599999999996
that's a good one

2769.2 --> 2775.0789999999997
asimov foundation

2771.68 --> 2775.0789999999997
i have

2775.119 --> 2782.839
read a part of that

2778.0 --> 2782.839
and then i got extremely bored

2793.92 --> 2796.7200000000003
like

2795.839 --> 2801.2
yeah

2796.72 --> 2801.2
but it was like it is like sci-fi

2802.24 --> 2806.16
it's like futuristic asimov yeah

2804.8 --> 2809.599
futurist

2806.16 --> 2811.44
foundation futurist i

2809.599 --> 2813.599
i guess that back in the day when i was

2811.44 --> 2815.04
really into space it did kind of appeal

2813.599 --> 2817.839
to me and all that

2815.04 --> 2817.839
but just

2819.76 --> 2824.6400000000003
my response to like looking in that book

2822.24 --> 2826.319
back then and that's over 20 years ago

2824.64 --> 2828.0
that's in my teens

2826.319 --> 2830.079
i was like

2828.0 --> 2833.359
yeah i can think of better [ __ ] that's

2830.079 --> 2833.3590000000004
what i felt like literally

2834.0 --> 2838.56
like yeah it's

2835.28 --> 2841.8390000000004
that's a decent futuristic approach

2838.56 --> 2841.839
but i can do better

2842.8 --> 2848.48
right that's ball win basically

2846.16 --> 2848.48
uh

2848.96 --> 2853.76
i don't know i haven't really

2851.599 --> 2857.319
read it

2853.76 --> 2857.3190000000004
in a long time

2858.079 --> 2862.6400000000003
you watch two dollars

2860.16 --> 2864.319
yeah yeah

2862.64 --> 2867.2799999999997
you watched it i watched the entire

2864.319 --> 2871.72
movie gadget inspector

2867.28 --> 2871.7200000000003
that movie is crazy

2873.599 --> 2877.599
it's like

2875.839 --> 2880.5589999999997
it was

2877.599 --> 2883.2000000000003
brilliant and terrible at the same time

2880.559 --> 2885.52
it was so

2883.2 --> 2887.04
messy

2885.52 --> 2888.64
but

2887.04 --> 2892.079
yeah

2888.64 --> 2893.92
it definitely was a very unique comedic

2892.079 --> 2896.319
movie i thought

2893.92 --> 2897.2000000000003
and i even recognized a whole bunch of

2896.319 --> 2899.68
like

2897.2 --> 2901.2
parodies that have probably been echoing

2899.68 --> 2903.2799999999997
it

2901.2 --> 2905.52
like i even recognize the south park

2903.28 --> 2908.0
episode is like blatantly obvious

2905.52 --> 2910.88
inspired on this movie i had no idea it

2908.0 --> 2912.88
was based on an on a comedic movie i

2910.88 --> 2916.2400000000002
thought it was just based originally on

2912.88 --> 2919.6800000000003
some serious movie like a standard

2916.24 --> 2921.9199999999996
romantic comedy thing or something

2919.68 --> 2923.2799999999997
i didn't know there was a movie like

2921.92 --> 2925.28
this out there

2923.28 --> 2926.8390000000004
so i definitely appreciate the tip from

2925.28 --> 2930.3190000000004
nathan it was

2926.839 --> 2932.0
hilarious despite its sucky name

2930.319 --> 2934.64
better off dead

2932.0 --> 2938.4
i i did not like the name

2934.64 --> 2938.4
but the movie is hilarious

2938.8 --> 2942.48
and just

2940.72 --> 2943.7599999999998
idiotic

2942.48 --> 2946.96
but

2943.76 --> 2946.96
but just amazing

2955.76 --> 2958.88
yeah i'm not gonna spoil it for you if

2957.52 --> 2960.64
you haven't actually watched the thing

2958.88 --> 2961.76
there's just like

2960.64 --> 2964.0
the first

2961.76 --> 2967.0400000000004
one third the first act

2964.0 --> 2968.72
is like it is almost like boring

2967.04 --> 2971.839
and you know they're trying to be goofy

2968.72 --> 2975.2799999999997
but it almost kind of fails and but then

2971.839 --> 2977.44
things start to like amp it up a little

2975.28 --> 2979.28
and then it's like whoa

2977.44 --> 2982.0
what the [ __ ]

2979.28 --> 2985.52
like okay that is kind of funny and then

2982.0 --> 2987.359
in the third act it goes bananas

2985.52 --> 2989.7599999999998
and you're like whoa

2987.359 --> 2990.7999999999997
dude i did not expect that at the

2989.76 --> 2993.2000000000003
beginning

2990.8 --> 2995.04
right it is

2993.2 --> 2996.72
it was quite a unique experience i

2995.04 --> 2999.839
definitely recommend you watch it if you

2996.72 --> 2999.839
thought the trailer was funny

3010.839 --> 3016.0
also the girl's french accent was

3014.559 --> 3019.44
terrible

3016.0 --> 3023.44
not convincing at all

3019.44 --> 3024.319
i can do a better fake french accent

3023.44 --> 3027.839
any

3024.319 --> 3027.839
day of the week

3031.599 --> 3036.6400000000003
because she didn't have the right

3032.8 --> 3036.6400000000003
inflections to be actually french

3037.68 --> 3041.839
she's still very cute

3046.0 --> 3050.16
but it was almost part of it because

3047.839 --> 3051.44
everything was so bizarre

3050.16 --> 3052.7999999999997
and like

3051.44 --> 3055.52
clunky

3052.8 --> 3059.04
that like the bad french accent almost

3055.52 --> 3062.079
had to be like that in retrospect it is

3059.04 --> 3064.88
it is a weird movie

3062.079 --> 3067.599
what email address can you send a song

3064.88 --> 3068.48
you wrote okay uh well my email address

3067.599 --> 3071.0
is

3068.48 --> 3074.079
right there

3071.0 --> 3076.0
rwin33 gmail.com

3074.079 --> 3078.88
it's literally the first sentence in the

3076.0 --> 3080.88
description box it is also the address

3078.88 --> 3083.6800000000003
for my skype if you want to add me on

3080.88 --> 3086.7200000000003
skype and it's also the address if you

3083.68 --> 3089.839
want to paypal me so yeah

3086.72 --> 3089.839
it's right there

3090.48 --> 3094.48
can't get in more in your face well i

3092.8 --> 3095.52
could i could literally have it on the

3094.48 --> 3097.2
screen

3095.52 --> 3099.68
but that's kind of pointless you just

3097.2 --> 3103.2799999999997
have to scroll down just a little and

3099.68 --> 3103.2799999999997
it's right there three times

3107.68 --> 3111.839
i mean two times

3109.2 --> 3111.839
whatever

3130.4 --> 3134.2000000000003
what's going on here

3141.28 --> 3144.079
oh really

3144.4 --> 3147.76
oh

3145.28 --> 3149.6800000000003
oh there you go

3147.76 --> 3151.5200000000004
yeah but cps

3149.68 --> 3155.04
i'm gonna address you even though you're

3151.52 --> 3159.52
talking to some peaceful warrior

3155.04 --> 3164.079
create doubt no no no no he's just

3159.52 --> 3166.559
buying he's falling into the trap that

3164.079 --> 3169.52
is also a part of the bible

3166.559 --> 3170.559
and that makes people atheists

3169.52 --> 3173.119
right

3170.559 --> 3174.3190000000004
it makes you an atheist

3173.119 --> 3178.2400000000002
if you're not

3174.319 --> 3181.599
smart enough to see through these things

3178.24 --> 3184.4799999999996
see what's behind if you don't get it

3181.599 --> 3187.2000000000003
yeah it's kind of like oh it's trying to

3184.48 --> 3189.04
make me stupid

3187.2 --> 3191.5989999999997
yeah yeah that's part of the test you

3189.04 --> 3193.52
dummy it's part of the test

3191.599 --> 3196.079
huh

3193.52 --> 3198.8
oh so that's a good excuse to throw it

3196.079 --> 3200.4
all in the can is it

3198.8 --> 3202.6400000000003
because

3200.4 --> 3204.64
on the surface oh it's telling me things

3202.64 --> 3206.24
that aren't entirely logically

3204.64 --> 3208.64
consistent yeah yeah it's part of the

3206.24 --> 3211.359
test you dummy

3208.64 --> 3211.359
don't get it

3212.16 --> 3216.16
you have to figure it out

3214.24 --> 3219.2
it's a giant test

3216.16 --> 3221.52
it's a reflector

3219.2 --> 3223.5989999999997
tells you things sometimes those things

3221.52 --> 3228.079
are wrong

3223.599 --> 3231.76
and other times they're absurdly correct

3228.079 --> 3233.28
and there is a balance between the wrong

3231.76 --> 3236.079
and the right

3233.28 --> 3238.6400000000003
and it has to be there

3236.079 --> 3241.119
it's part of the test and it's part of

3238.64 --> 3244.5589999999997
revealing a structure

3241.119 --> 3246.7200000000003
of the fabric of reality itself

3244.559 --> 3249.76
energy the energy

3246.72 --> 3251.839
how things work how things balance out

3249.76 --> 3254.079
how they have to it's a part of the

3251.839 --> 3256.96
design itself it is

3254.079 --> 3259.92
there for you to figure that out

3256.96 --> 3264.16
once you allow yourself to overcome

3259.92 --> 3265.359
those very superficial obstacles

3264.16 --> 3267.7599999999998
that cause

3265.359 --> 3270.88
one half of the numpties to turn to

3267.76 --> 3273.2000000000003
atheist and the other into blindly

3270.88 --> 3275.2000000000003
believing sheep

3273.2 --> 3278.799
that'll do whatever their priest tells

3275.2 --> 3281.359
them yeah yeah that's part of the test

3278.799 --> 3285.28
yeah are you either one of these or are

3281.359 --> 3288.2799999999997
you actually gonna find the way through

3285.28 --> 3288.28
huh

3302.559 --> 3305.6800000000003
beating the contradiction in the bible

3304.88 --> 3307.76
yeah

3305.68 --> 3311.64
yeah

3307.76 --> 3311.6400000000003
thank you captain obvious

3327.839 --> 3332.16
right the road is narrow and most of all

3330.72 --> 3334.5589999999997
difficult

3332.16 --> 3336.48
the road is about tension the road is

3334.559 --> 3340.0
about

3336.48 --> 3342.72
the narrowness of the options

3340.0 --> 3345.359
and the increase of the burden

3342.72 --> 3347.04
and if you handle it

3345.359 --> 3350.5589999999997
the reward

3347.04 --> 3354.0
the actual reward a reward that usually

3350.559 --> 3357.96
defies your own imagination

3354.0 --> 3357.96
for when you start out

3367.68 --> 3372.5989999999997
got some gammas in the house but not for

3369.599 --> 3372.599
long

3379.68 --> 3383.68
people call god a liar

3387.68 --> 3391.7599999999998
you gotta elaborate late on that

3390.72 --> 3394.16
right

3391.76 --> 3395.6800000000003
because

3394.16 --> 3398.16
what is this

3395.68 --> 3399.7599999999998
biblical god exactly that you're talking

3398.16 --> 3402.8799999999997
about

3399.76 --> 3402.88
are you talking about

3403.2 --> 3408.799
some claim that a priesthood has made

3405.76 --> 3408.7990000000004
about the bible

3409.44 --> 3414.16
what exactly is it

3411.52 --> 3414.16
that you think

3415.28 --> 3420.559
or what is it what you what is it that

3417.76 --> 3423.599
you think about it

3420.559 --> 3424.6400000000003
and stop trying to cover your ass

3423.599 --> 3427.2000000000003
yeah

3424.64 --> 3429.04
you don't have to disclaim oh you know

3427.2 --> 3431.359
you'd made a statement

3429.04 --> 3433.7599999999998
you can't unmake that statement unless

3431.359 --> 3438.16
you literally retract it so why don't

3433.76 --> 3438.1600000000003
you just get on with it and make a point

3438.799 --> 3443.079
what's the trick you fell for

3463.599 --> 3468.4
no what don't you don't eat how can you

3466.72 --> 3470.8799999999997
say that what

3468.4 --> 3472.48
you don't even know

3470.88 --> 3475.359
what he really means

3472.48 --> 3478.0
he hasn't elaborated on it

3475.359 --> 3480.48
you can't tell him he's advocating

3478.0 --> 3482.319
he's being a devil's advocate

3480.48 --> 3485.28
or even that he's talking bs because he

3482.319 --> 3488.48
hasn't said anything

3485.28 --> 3490.88
not really it's only hinted at something

3488.48 --> 3493.68
and then he tried to cover his ass like

3490.88 --> 3495.599
in three different locations so

3493.68 --> 3498.5989999999997
he hasn't actually made any statement

3495.599 --> 3498.599
yet

3502.16 --> 3507.44
yeah but see

3503.839 --> 3507.44
right now he's making a statement

3508.64 --> 3512.8799999999997
so

3510.64 --> 3514.0789999999997
exactly

3512.88 --> 3515.28
which

3514.079 --> 3518.6400000000003
god

3515.28 --> 3522.4
in the bible do you refer to

3518.64 --> 3522.4
like which one

3522.88 --> 3526.4
oh you didn't know

3528.799 --> 3531.839
you didn't know

3536.88 --> 3541.839
because you seem to like address

3540.0 --> 3545.04
god in the bible

3541.839 --> 3548.96
as a singular god

3545.04 --> 3548.96
that's an interesting assumption

3553.68 --> 3559.839
it's further up yeah well repost it then

3556.319 --> 3563.72
i'm not going to scroll up for you

3559.839 --> 3563.72
just talking right now

3563.74 --> 3566.8799999999997
[Music]

3584.079 --> 3588.88
ask the question again do

3586.559 --> 3590.6800000000003
you think

3588.88 --> 3592.4
there is a

3590.68 --> 3596.72
singular

3592.4 --> 3600.44
god in the bible

3596.72 --> 3600.4399999999996
is that clear enough

3657.68 --> 3661.52
and it is slow okay well you might have

3660.16 --> 3664.16
like up

3661.52 --> 3666.72
like up to speed problems

3664.16 --> 3670.839
it happens to me too sometime

3666.72 --> 3670.839
i hope you caught that one

3681.52 --> 3686.64
there's only one creator

3684.48 --> 3689.839
how do you know

3686.64 --> 3689.839
what about the alien

3693.04 --> 3696.92
like what is it

3719.28 --> 3723.0
since they didn't

3728.72 --> 3732.3999999999996
that's all i said

3731.2 --> 3734.96
okay

3732.4 --> 3737.28
well i'm sorry that that's

3734.96 --> 3740.0
to you actually

3737.28 --> 3741.3590000000004
something that is legitimate right

3740.0 --> 3744.24
because

3741.359 --> 3744.24
they did die

3744.4 --> 3747.6800000000003
did they live forever

3749.039 --> 3752.7200000000003
didn't part

3751.28 --> 3755.76
of their

3752.72 --> 3759.2
well-being of their actual life die

3755.76 --> 3759.2000000000003
right what is dying

3759.68 --> 3763.839
like what does it even mean like

3762.799 --> 3766.839
then

3763.839 --> 3770.16
what does dying mean in

3766.839 --> 3772.0
paradise have you ever considered

3770.16 --> 3774.64
thinking about it a little bit more

3772.0 --> 3774.64
carefully

3774.799 --> 3779.92
it's just like oh no that didn't happen

3776.72 --> 3780.8799999999997
oh oh oh that means it's all unravels

3779.92 --> 3784.88
because

3780.88 --> 3788.52
you didn't look at it from another angle

3784.88 --> 3788.52
like what the hell

3801.52 --> 3806.24
it's just ridiculous like i

3804.16 --> 3810.0789999999997
i feel like i just wasted a whole bunch

3806.24 --> 3812.0
of statements over something so trivial

3810.079 --> 3814.4
that you literally had to write like

3812.0 --> 3817.64
five minutes of excuses trying to cover

3814.4 --> 3817.64
your ass

3835.839 --> 3839.0389999999998
all right i bet they did die inside

3838.24 --> 3841.5989999999997
right

3839.039 --> 3844.0
but not because of the apple you see it

3841.599 --> 3847.28
was a reification

3844.0 --> 3849.28
it wasn't the apple that did anything

3847.28 --> 3852.7200000000003
it was them

3849.28 --> 3857.28
violating the one rule of god

3852.72 --> 3859.68
that made god kill them that made them

3857.28 --> 3862.3190000000004
allegedly mortal

3859.68 --> 3864.0789999999997
and they definitely were retracted from

3862.319 --> 3865.839
god's blessing

3864.079 --> 3869.119
from the

3865.839 --> 3871.68
state and in that sense they did die not

3869.119 --> 3874.559
because of the literal apple it wasn't a

3871.68 --> 3880.7599999999998
poisonous apple it was just the one

3874.559 --> 3880.76
thing off limit that's the entire point

3890.079 --> 3893.28
right

3890.96 --> 3895.28
pj croce yeah well i just gonna say

3893.28 --> 3896.6400000000003
allegedly

3895.28 --> 3898.7200000000003
i wasn't there

3896.64 --> 3902.0
who knows man maybe they just went back

3898.72 --> 3902.0
to sleep maybe i don't know

3903.92 --> 3907.16
but yeah

3909.039 --> 3912.28
that's right

3931.839 --> 3938.72
now deed will get you into heaven

3935.039 --> 3940.2400000000002
only through jesus well through his

3938.72 --> 3941.9199999999996
his methods

3940.24 --> 3944.5589999999997
for his guidance

3941.92 --> 3947.119
through his understanding

3944.559 --> 3948.799
and a deed alone a deed without

3947.119 --> 3951.28
understanding

3948.799 --> 3953.68
indeed does not get you closer to

3951.28 --> 3956.079
heavenly state

3953.68 --> 3958.48
that's correct

3956.079 --> 3960.7200000000003
because that's like could be compared to

3958.48 --> 3963.599
like a stupid politician virtuous

3960.72 --> 3965.52
signaling to the right group

3963.599 --> 3968.079
right

3965.52 --> 3970.88
when they when he doesn't respect them

3968.079 --> 3972.88
for example right it's just a good favor

3970.88 --> 3978.0
now well how do you get to heaven from

3972.88 --> 3982.319
that it's greed that guided them

3978.0 --> 3984.88
not the actual understanding

3982.319 --> 3987.0389999999998
and that's what that statement in my

3984.88 --> 3990.039
personal opinion really means peaceful

3987.039 --> 3990.039
warrior

3996.4 --> 4002.1600000000003
sorry to have caused this to what are

3998.0 --> 4002.16
you blabbering stop being so apologetic

4002.48 --> 4007.039
dude everybody makes mistakes

4005.359 --> 4009.839
i'm just going to be very passionate

4007.039 --> 4009.8390000000004
addressing it

4010.24 --> 4013.52
because i want it

4018.16 --> 4024.319
i mean i constantly getting on people's

4021.359 --> 4028.5589999999997
nerves concerning christianity

4024.319 --> 4028.5589999999997
because i have my own interpretation

4030.64 --> 4037.839
i'm a jesus spoken a jesus spoken word

4035.2 --> 4039.5989999999997
of jesus fanatic

4037.839 --> 4042.5589999999997
in my own way

4039.599 --> 4045.559
it's really his words that bind me

4042.559 --> 4045.559
mentally

4048.0 --> 4053.039
and it's weird because it's not like oh

4050.24 --> 4055.52
i read every like oh i'm gonna condense

4053.039 --> 4058.48
the entire bible to only jesus's words

4055.52 --> 4059.92
and then i'm gonna read that every day

4058.48 --> 4060.72
every day

4059.92 --> 4064.0
no

4060.72 --> 4066.24
it's just i realize this about it

4064.0 --> 4069.44
because every time i do read something

4066.24 --> 4073.5989999999997
from it's again like oh my gosh

4069.44 --> 4077.119
mind blown reminded reminded of what i

4073.599 --> 4078.799
trusted to be true and seeing it to be

4077.119 --> 4079.92
true again

4078.799 --> 4082.16
right

4079.92 --> 4082.16
i

4083.52 --> 4086.88
i like to take

4085.119 --> 4089.039
jesus's words

4086.88 --> 4091.2000000000003
like a very fine

4089.039 --> 4093.6800000000003
wine i don't drink it all that i don't

4091.2 --> 4097.12
gobble it up all the time i just spare

4093.68 --> 4100.0
it for the special moments that sounds a

4097.12 --> 4100.0
bit weird maybe

4100.239 --> 4105.2789999999995
but that's how i do it

4103.359 --> 4107.759
i i cherish

4105.279 --> 4110.319
the best things i don't just

4107.759 --> 4111.92
try to inject it in my arm like a drug

4110.319 --> 4112.88
or something

4111.92 --> 4114.719
right

4112.88 --> 4117.12
this is ridiculous

4114.719 --> 4118.4800000000005
like that just makes you squirt all the

4117.12 --> 4120.96
time and then the

4118.48 --> 4122.799
you get in an addiction cycle

4120.96 --> 4124.4800000000005
doesn't matter what you're addicted to

4122.799 --> 4126.4
if it's an addiction cycle it's an

4124.48 --> 4128.08
addiction cycle it's gonna distract you

4126.4 --> 4129.759
because that's what the addiction does

4128.08 --> 4133.12
it distracts you from

4129.759 --> 4134.88
the still quiet moments where unique

4133.12 --> 4137.5199999999995
things sprout forth

4134.88 --> 4139.04
that are part of you of your soul your

4137.52 --> 4140.400000000001
unique

4139.04 --> 4143.199
person

4140.4 --> 4147.3189999999995
the reason why we're here

4143.199 --> 4147.3189999999995
the fruits of the design

4158.56 --> 4165.080000000001
okay peaceful warrior no problem

4161.52 --> 4165.080000000001
never heard of him

4216.8 --> 4220.320000000001
what that's there

4218.4 --> 4223.12
what

4220.32 --> 4227.4
what are you talking about

4223.12 --> 4227.4
i don't understand what you're saying

4244.719 --> 4249.56
okay that's taylor thanks for popping by

4260.239 --> 4262.48
now

4266.88 --> 4269.88
what

4294.0 --> 4297.44
14th okay

4298.239 --> 4301.239
hmm

4309.6 --> 4313.280000000001
interesting i guess

4311.36 --> 4317.199
don't know if that really has anything

4313.28 --> 4317.199
to do with our current age though but

4320.159 --> 4325.759999999999
like the only oh that sort of [ __ ] is

4323.12 --> 4329.04
only gonna happen once the setting for

4325.76 --> 4332.88
this world ends once

4329.04 --> 4334.64
the simulatory reductions

4332.88 --> 4336.96
are turned off

4334.64 --> 4339.6
right

4336.96 --> 4340.719
and when that happens this world as we

4339.6 --> 4343.120000000001
experience

4340.719 --> 4345.04
then doesn't exist anymore we're still

4343.12 --> 4346.159
here it just doesn't work that way

4345.04 --> 4348.239
anymore

4346.159 --> 4350.639999999999
that's what i think might happen

4348.239 --> 4354.08
i think it has actually happened a

4350.64 --> 4357.84
couple of times we're just

4354.08 --> 4357.84
in the middle of your sleep

4358.48 --> 4363.5199999999995
and yeah like you finish your waking

4361.76 --> 4365.280000000001
cycle but then as soon as you go to

4363.52 --> 4369.6
sleep suddenly

4365.28 --> 4371.599999999999
the entire world is like switched around

4369.6 --> 4374.8
i guess that could be interpreted as a

4371.6 --> 4377.76
mandela like effect but i i i kind of

4374.8 --> 4381.28
have experiences like that i just

4377.76 --> 4383.52
i refuse to go in a squirt cycle over it

4381.28 --> 4385.599999999999
it's like yeah what the [ __ ] are you

4383.52 --> 4388.159000000001
gonna do about it man

4385.6 --> 4391.6
nothing absolutely nothing and you have

4388.159 --> 4393.839999999999
no influence whatsoever the only thing

4391.6 --> 4398.92
you can let that foreknowledge or

4393.84 --> 4398.92
insight do to you is ruin your life

4399.6 --> 4401.76
so

4402.4 --> 4406.639999999999
yeah whatever

4403.76 --> 4409.04
that is going up to heaven and trading

4406.64 --> 4410.84
in an actual com that's not gonna be in

4409.04 --> 4414.8
this world

4410.84 --> 4416.8
setting it might be in between

4414.8 --> 4419.679
when this world setting is then

4416.8 --> 4424.96
temporarily shut down because the

4419.679 --> 4424.96
contract for its setup has ended

4425.04 --> 4430.4
and yeah that's not like all the 3 000

4428.239 --> 4433.04
2000 no no no that's just like the last

4430.4 --> 4433.04
10 years

4436.08 --> 4441.76
or 30 whatever 50 years

4439.12 --> 4446.64
not that long even

4441.76 --> 4446.64
world changes a lot people like

4446.88 --> 4449.84
the other side

4451.199 --> 4454.879999999999
it is hyper

4452.84 --> 4458.400000000001
flexible but

4454.88 --> 4458.400000000001
extremely conditional

4461.679 --> 4465.6
i want evil to be over forever

4467.44 --> 4472.639999999999
well you'll be safe you might

4470.32 --> 4472.639999999999
yeah

4472.88 --> 4477.4400000000005
but you don't under impl you don't truly

4475.52 --> 4479.4400000000005
understand the implications of forever

4477.44 --> 4482.0
because

4479.44 --> 4485.12
once it's gone you will like forever

4482.0 --> 4488.48
means you miss it forever

4485.12 --> 4491.679
and as long as there is a

4488.48 --> 4494.4
personal growth and change cycle that is

4491.679 --> 4494.4
inevitable

4495.52 --> 4498.56
right

4496.4 --> 4501.12
let me try to summarize it in kind of a

4498.56 --> 4502.64
basic story set up

4501.12 --> 4505.199
like

4502.64 --> 4507.52
let's talk about military like military

4505.199 --> 4507.5199999999995
guys

4508.32 --> 4513.36
they go through heavy situations and if

4511.28 --> 4516.159
they're not like super traumatized or

4513.36 --> 4517.44
heavily wounded or anything yeah

4516.159 --> 4519.04
when they

4517.44 --> 4521.919999999999
retire

4519.04 --> 4523.679
a lot of them actually end up

4521.92 --> 4526.8
missing it

4523.679 --> 4528.4800000000005
including an enemy a worthy enemy they

4526.8 --> 4530.400000000001
miss the enemy

4528.48 --> 4534.08
yeah

4530.4 --> 4538.799999999999
so to say i want evil to be over forever

4534.08 --> 4541.84
is a foolish and very youthful statement

4538.8 --> 4543.84
because no in reality

4541.84 --> 4547.679
no

4543.84 --> 4550.400000000001
you just want this specific build up

4547.679 --> 4552.96
this cycle that is built up for a very

4550.4 --> 4555.5199999999995
long time you basically what you really

4552.96 --> 4558.32
want to say is i want this

4555.52 --> 4560.0
spiritual babylonian tower that is being

4558.32 --> 4565.199
built and that is starting to reach a

4560.0 --> 4568.48
peak you want that one to topple

4565.199 --> 4568.48
that is what you really want

4569.44 --> 4572.32
and i get that

4573.12 --> 4578.12
you just want this evil to be done with

4582.719 --> 4585.84
dude aries

4588.0 --> 4591.239
the hell

4605.44 --> 4611.04
right because if we wouldn't be allowed

4608.159 --> 4613.679
to do evil then eventually the good

4611.04 --> 4617.12
would become the evil to us because it

4613.679 --> 4620.4
would take our freedom away

4617.12 --> 4623.4
what good is good when you can't choose

4620.4 --> 4623.4
good

4643.12 --> 4646.4
all right dutch sailor now i

4644.8 --> 4648.08
i get it i'm

4646.4 --> 4649.5199999999995
i'm just trying to

4648.08 --> 4652.32
help you

4649.52 --> 4655.040000000001
with a slight correction that'll be

4652.32 --> 4657.679
wiser to to basically when you feel the

4655.04 --> 4660.56
need to express this thing

4657.679 --> 4662.96
to then take it just a tiny step back

4660.56 --> 4665.360000000001
and get a little bit more realistic

4662.96 --> 4667.28
right because a lot of people out there

4665.36 --> 4668.799999999999
in the world right now just want this

4667.28 --> 4670.8
current evil

4668.8 --> 4673.12
system to kind of be over they're sick

4670.8 --> 4673.12
of it

4673.679 --> 4679.84
but evil forever that's literally a

4676.4 --> 4679.839999999999
delusional statement

4682.239 --> 4684.48
like

4685.04 --> 4691.28
the three words end evil forever

4689.76 --> 4693.84
are

4691.28 --> 4697.36
that that can never be

4693.84 --> 4697.360000000001
not in this form

4697.44 --> 4702.239
right it's part of like the purpose of

4699.76 --> 4705.64
it this is the test without it it's like

4702.239 --> 4705.639999999999
so you can't

4708.96 --> 4714.8
and hey if you can't handle that then

4710.96 --> 4714.8
it's gonna wear on you until you die so

4715.44 --> 4722.08
it's just the way it is it wears on

4718.84 --> 4723.92
me i really do not appreciate evil in

4722.08 --> 4725.76
many ways because

4723.92 --> 4727.04
there's so much more i can do with good

4725.76 --> 4729.280000000001
i've always

4727.04 --> 4731.04
functioned on a very high level

4729.28 --> 4735.0
when everybody's just good and i could

4731.04 --> 4735.0
just trust that

4735.6 --> 4739.120000000001
when i was basically in a safe social

4738.0 --> 4742.08
environment

4739.12 --> 4745.76
that kind of just at least respected me

4742.08 --> 4748.48
right but yeah that's not this world

4745.76 --> 4751.8
so it's never gonna go away what this

4748.48 --> 4751.799999999999
world is

4762.48 --> 4766.639999999999
being a thief's guild is a moral

4764.8 --> 4769.52
conundrum

4766.64 --> 4770.719
it is good to be good at your job

4769.52 --> 4772.719
what

4770.719 --> 4774.719
no

4772.719 --> 4777.84
do you actually know what what thieves

4774.719 --> 4777.84
guild really are

4778.0 --> 4780.32
i mean

4788.239 --> 4793.28
like being good at something doesn't

4790.96 --> 4795.84
really justify

4793.28 --> 4798.08
doing damage to others

4795.84 --> 4798.08
right

4799.76 --> 4805.12
it's not really a moral conundrum it's

4801.76 --> 4807.280000000001
it's just blatantly is in

4805.12 --> 4809.12
but hey

4807.28 --> 4811.12
you might

4809.12 --> 4814.0
if you're very good at your skill at

4811.12 --> 4814.8
some point do something good with it too

4814.0 --> 4817.36
right

4814.8 --> 4819.679
who knows say maybe something unique

4817.36 --> 4821.839999999999
that is very required

4819.679 --> 4822.719
god likes to figure those things out for

4821.84 --> 4824.32
you

4822.719 --> 4827.6
but

4824.32 --> 4830.5599999999995
no it's not a moral conundrum like

4827.6 --> 4832.400000000001
skills don't weigh up against doing

4830.56 --> 4834.639
damage sinning

4832.4 --> 4834.638999999999
right

4840.88 --> 4847.4400000000005
but it's not a paradox

4844.08 --> 4848.5599999999995
it's just two things that don't

4847.44 --> 4850.48
that yeah

4848.56 --> 4853.280000000001
it doesn't really weigh off like the sin

4850.48 --> 4855.199
is the sin right that's like say that's

4853.28 --> 4856.8
i don't really want to put it right next

4855.199 --> 4859.04
to it but it's the same like

4856.8 --> 4862.2390000000005
prostitution like oh wow but they're so

4859.04 --> 4864.4
good at what they do yeah yeah

4862.239 --> 4866.718999999999
that's cute

4864.4 --> 4870.239
it's gonna do damage

4866.719 --> 4871.84
directly or indirectly though

4870.239 --> 4873.839999999999
right it's gonna corrupt a bunch of

4871.84 --> 4875.52
people it's gonna dissuade them from

4873.84 --> 4878.400000000001
doing the right thing

4875.52 --> 4880.2390000000005
so yeah oh they're so good at it oh yeah

4878.4 --> 4882.159
and a lot of people might appreciate it

4880.239 --> 4884.48
yeah that's nice

4882.159 --> 4885.839999999999
it's not a moral conundrum though it's

4884.48 --> 4886.879999999999
just a sin

4885.84 --> 4889.6
and hey

4886.88 --> 4891.76
who knows that skill might uniquely

4889.6 --> 4894.639
serve some good purpose at some point it

4891.76 --> 4897.04
doesn't make everything else all right

4894.639 --> 4899.04
it's just a fact

4897.04 --> 4903.08
it's not a moral conundrum this two

4899.04 --> 4903.08
things that are not really related

4904.48 --> 4906.718999999999
right

4914.719 --> 4921.88
do you wanna see my bow stuff what

4918.88 --> 4921.88
okay

4930.88 --> 4935.1990000000005
oh come on

4932.719 --> 4939.2390000000005
i don't care man

4935.199 --> 4939.239
call jesus to me

4944.159 --> 4947.759999999999
i've always been terrible at names

4945.84 --> 4950.159000000001
anyway

4947.76 --> 4951.52
i i don't think jesus is going to mind

4950.159 --> 4954.239
if you

4951.52 --> 4958.1990000000005
pronounced his name incorrectly

4954.239 --> 4958.199
when you go to meet him

4959.44 --> 4963.839999999999
i i really only

4961.36 --> 4965.679
he only cares whether you actually try

4963.84 --> 4968.88
to follow his advice that's like the

4965.679 --> 4970.0
only thing that is what he made himself

4968.88 --> 4974.4800000000005
what he is

4970.0 --> 4976.159
what he means to all things

4974.48 --> 4978.32
that's his lesson

4976.159 --> 4980.799999999999
that's the one big message

4978.32 --> 4983.199
doesn't give a [ __ ] what you call him

4980.8 --> 4984.84
you think he's nitpicky

4983.199 --> 4987.678999999999
you really think that

4984.84 --> 4990.400000000001
jesus is nitpicky

4987.679 --> 4992.639
on what you call somebody

4990.4 --> 4994.96
like how you pronounce their name do you

4992.639 --> 4999.56
really think

4994.96 --> 4999.56
he gives a [ __ ] about that really

5002.639 --> 5007.04
i i don't understand how you could

5007.199 --> 5012.5199999999995
come to such a conclusion in any way

5009.52 --> 5012.52
really

5022.639 --> 5028.28
a little comedic movie quote

5025.28 --> 5028.28
okay

5029.6 --> 5033.6
i don't even see what's funny about that

5035.199 --> 5039.5199999999995
unless maybe you're a squirt boy and you

5037.36 --> 5044.0
think everything is sexual

5039.52 --> 5046.88
and then ha ha this is funny

5044.0 --> 5051.36
because it's an object and when i think

5046.88 --> 5051.36
of an object i think of a penis

5051.92 --> 5057.4800000000005
yeah sorry that's not funny to me

5057.76 --> 5061.12
especially since a bo staff is a pretty

5060.0 --> 5064.48
good

5061.12 --> 5066.48
weapon in dungeons and dragons

5064.48 --> 5069.919999999999
like to me it literally just doesn't

5066.48 --> 5072.718999999999
mean i i don't do that i just don't do

5069.92 --> 5074.8
that anymore when i look at the world

5072.719 --> 5075.92
i don't see

5074.8 --> 5077.6
dicks

5075.92 --> 5080.0
boobs

5077.6 --> 5081.76
and vaginas yeah

5080.0 --> 5083.28
i see

5081.76 --> 5085.62
trees

5083.28 --> 5086.8
a chimney

5085.62 --> 5089.12
[Music]

5086.8 --> 5092.29
a teapot

5089.12 --> 5095.39
a microphone

5092.29 --> 5095.39
[Music]

5100.0 --> 5105.679
because i'm not a sexual degenerate you

5103.44 --> 5105.678999999999
see

5105.76 --> 5110.639
it used to be a little

5107.52 --> 5113.1990000000005
during my teens but that kind of

5110.639 --> 5115.04
moved out of my system

5113.199 --> 5116.239
because it was a complete waste of my

5115.04 --> 5118.32
energy

5116.239 --> 5120.799999999999
and it prevented me from actually

5118.32 --> 5123.799999999999
learning things

5120.8 --> 5123.8
right

5139.04 --> 5146.12
ah well said godzilla 37.

5143.12 --> 5146.12
uh

5182.56 --> 5187.6
eating shrimp is a sin in the bible

5185.199 --> 5190.4
really where

5187.6 --> 5190.400000000001
who says that

5190.639 --> 5196.36
like cps who says that

5193.36 --> 5196.36
curious

5215.84 --> 5219.84
no who

5217.199 --> 5219.839999999999
says that

5219.92 --> 5226.08
i i heard you i read it when you wrote

5222.96 --> 5228.159
it in your previous sentence

5226.08 --> 5230.0
cps

5228.159 --> 5232.08
i just want to know

5230.0 --> 5234.08
what where did you get that who says

5232.08 --> 5236.32
that did jesus

5234.08 --> 5237.44
say that

5236.32 --> 5239.5199999999995
could be

5237.44 --> 5241.36
might have missed that

5239.52 --> 5243.76
i'm just asking

5241.36 --> 5245.839999999999
right you're making a statement about

5243.76 --> 5247.679
the bible

5245.84 --> 5250.08
well if you're gonna do that you better

5247.679 --> 5253.12
have something prepared to back up that

5250.08 --> 5257.48
statement you see because those things

5253.12 --> 5257.48
matter here in this stream

5266.4 --> 5269.599999999999
it's apparently the world yeah we have

5268.32 --> 5271.84
witch god

5269.6 --> 5275.2390000000005
cps

5271.84 --> 5275.2390000000005
which god

5284.56 --> 5288.080000000001
no what really

5285.92 --> 5291.36
or your comments get deleted

5288.08 --> 5293.5199999999995
well did you have a

5291.36 --> 5295.5199999999995
a certain word in it

5293.52 --> 5297.280000000001
starts with the p

5295.52 --> 5300.080000000001
ends with an o

5297.28 --> 5301.28
because yeah that word you don't talk

5300.08 --> 5302.96
about here

5301.28 --> 5305.44
you don't bring it up

5302.96 --> 5307.52
if you will it gets auto deleted it's

5305.44 --> 5309.678999999999
the only word

5307.52 --> 5313.4800000000005
otherwise i don't know what's going on

5309.679 --> 5313.4800000000005
aries cursed man

5342.08 --> 5347.28
pedantic

5344.639 --> 5347.28
oh oh

5347.36 --> 5350.36
okay

5353.199 --> 5358.4
no john bernards like even that freaking

5355.92 --> 5362.32
word is not banned

5358.4 --> 5364.239
i'm i'm very unrestricted really

5362.32 --> 5366.239
i mean if there's a troll constantly

5364.239 --> 5369.04
whining about something very specific i

5366.239 --> 5371.678999999999
might temporarily ban that word

5369.04 --> 5373.6
but then i will quickly remove it as

5371.679 --> 5376.4
soon as i'm satisfied that they're still

5373.6 --> 5380.159000000001
gonna stop trying that [ __ ]

5376.4 --> 5382.719
i only have one word on my banned list

5380.159 --> 5386.159
but who knows maybe youtube is just

5382.719 --> 5388.4800000000005
deciding no these words are banned too

5386.159 --> 5390.839999999999
just because we freaking say so and we

5388.48 --> 5395.678999999999
don't even tell you i don't

5390.84 --> 5395.679
know about the juice

5399.199 --> 5401.678999999999
okay

5404.56 --> 5407.56
what

5410.88 --> 5416.1990000000005
all right anyway i'll be back two

5413.199 --> 5416.199
minutes

5501.28 --> 5506.08
hmm

5502.48 --> 5507.839999999999
but anyway concerning the shellfish

5506.08 --> 5509.28
it's kind of funny that you mention it

5507.84 --> 5510.96
because

5509.28 --> 5513.599999999999
i don't eat

5510.96 --> 5514.719
don't eat them ever

5513.6 --> 5518.320000000001
like

5514.719 --> 5519.36
my parents like we would go to spain as

5518.32 --> 5521.679
a kid

5519.36 --> 5524.159
on vacation and then my parents would

5521.679 --> 5525.92
always like oh the fish and especially

5524.159 --> 5528.719
the shellfish

5525.92 --> 5532.36
crabs and

5528.719 --> 5532.36
what do you call them

5532.639 --> 5538.08
all kinds of and i was like

5536.199 --> 5539.44
disgusted

5538.08 --> 5542.239
crab

5539.44 --> 5543.678999999999
never tried it even once just the smell

5542.239 --> 5545.28
of it

5543.679 --> 5547.12
and that was

5545.28 --> 5550.32
clean like

5547.12 --> 5554.0
freshly caught like in the local ocean

5550.32 --> 5556.639
which wasn't really polluted at all

5554.0 --> 5558.639
so it wasn't even like really disgusting

5556.639 --> 5561.1990000000005
quality or anything like you have in

5558.639 --> 5565.28
some regions in the world

5561.199 --> 5566.239
and like lobsters i i just i don't like

5565.28 --> 5568.0
it

5566.239 --> 5571.678999999999
i really

5568.0 --> 5576.4
really don't want to eat that [ __ ] ever

5571.679 --> 5579.4400000000005
only thing that i even relatingly eat

5576.4 --> 5580.719
is like crab chips

5579.44 --> 5583.5199999999995
but that's

5580.719 --> 5585.92
organic they have organic crab chips and

5583.52 --> 5587.120000000001
that's actually kind of nice doesn't

5585.92 --> 5589.84
make me sick

5587.12 --> 5590.88
doesn't even remind me of how disgusting

5589.84 --> 5593.52
i think

5590.88 --> 5598.0
like actually cooked

5593.52 --> 5598.0
shellfish and [ __ ] are because i just

5598.32 --> 5603.36
don't like it and i don't like eating

5600.48 --> 5605.599999999999
fish but i do take fish oil though

5603.36 --> 5605.599999999999
right

5606.719 --> 5610.08
it should have a fin

5610.56 --> 5614.2390000000005
a testable eating shrimp

5615.6 --> 5617.84
okay

5618.32 --> 5623.36
well you know that krill oil is freaking

5620.48 --> 5626.48
amazing right and krill is basically

5623.36 --> 5628.639
very small shrimp

5626.48 --> 5628.638999999999
so

5628.8 --> 5633.28
i don't need look i'd like to ask like

5631.199 --> 5634.879999999999
what is the entire context of when that

5633.28 --> 5637.28
is brought up

5634.88 --> 5637.28
i mean

5637.36 --> 5642.5599999999995
did they give any reason would it be

5639.6 --> 5644.639
poisonous because what for example if it

5642.56 --> 5646.719
is typically in a period

5644.639 --> 5649.28
where the industry

5646.719 --> 5651.44
would basically eject

5649.28 --> 5654.5599999999995
highly toxic [ __ ]

5651.44 --> 5656.08
in the rivers and the ocean that usually

5654.56 --> 5657.92
nobody gets bothered about you know it

5656.08 --> 5660.88
doesn't poison it just this away but it

5657.92 --> 5664.08
might settle on the ocean bottom like

5660.88 --> 5666.56
who knows like iron by-products or

5664.08 --> 5668.48
garbage from mining and it will just

5666.56 --> 5669.76
settle on the ocean yeah guess what the

5668.48 --> 5672.799999999999
crap

5669.76 --> 5675.12
the shrimp they're gonna eat it

5672.8 --> 5677.04
and they're gonna get poisonous so maybe

5675.12 --> 5680.0
it was a

5677.04 --> 5682.32
current time in that time thousands of

5680.0 --> 5685.119
years ago warning like hey

5682.32 --> 5688.239
this [ __ ] is actually really bad for you

5685.119 --> 5690.08
we don't know why yet

5688.239 --> 5692.638999999999
because they don't understand pollution

5690.08 --> 5695.199
from industry

5692.639 --> 5696.400000000001
but yeah maybe it was about that right

5695.199 --> 5699.36
because

5696.4 --> 5701.599999999999
it really always does come down to

5699.36 --> 5704.639
poison is a sin

5701.6 --> 5705.84
poison in food is a sin so whatever food

5704.639 --> 5708.56
you're gonna

5705.84 --> 5710.400000000001
target for eating if it has been eating

5708.56 --> 5713.1990000000005
poison

5710.4 --> 5715.28
you're gonna get problems

5713.199 --> 5717.678999999999
right for pigs it was because they were

5715.28 --> 5719.679
used like garbage cans

5717.679 --> 5721.28
they literally just ate everything and

5719.679 --> 5724.56
people would feed them everything

5721.28 --> 5727.119
including disgusting [ __ ] rotten stuff

5724.56 --> 5727.119000000001
sometimes

5727.44 --> 5731.199
whatever

5728.88 --> 5734.08
right so then it beca it always

5731.199 --> 5736.879999999999
basically is like oh don't eat poison

5734.08 --> 5738.96
that's it don't eat poison you know

5736.88 --> 5740.159000000001
what if there's like a certain plant and

5738.96 --> 5742.88
it grows

5740.159 --> 5745.679
only knowingly in a certain region where

5742.88 --> 5746.4800000000005
there is where there's

5745.679 --> 5748.4
like

5746.48 --> 5750.239
toxic

5748.4 --> 5751.04
[ __ ] in the ground and it's always been

5750.239 --> 5753.839999999999
there

5751.04 --> 5757.04
well then biblically one could come to

5753.84 --> 5758.159000000001
the conclusion never eat this plant this

5757.04 --> 5762.4
plant

5758.159 --> 5763.28
it might seem good but it's poisonous

5762.4 --> 5765.5199999999995
yeah

5763.28 --> 5768.0
but is that because that plant is

5765.52 --> 5770.88
poisonous or is that because that plant

5768.0 --> 5772.8
always seems to grow in a place where it

5770.88 --> 5774.96
absorbs poison

5772.8 --> 5775.84
that when you eat it you get that poison

5774.96 --> 5779.119
right

5775.84 --> 5779.119000000001
how does this really work

5781.04 --> 5785.36
so if you take shellfish fish but you

5784.239 --> 5788.959999999999
actually

5785.36 --> 5792.48
breed them in very

5788.96 --> 5792.4800000000005
good quality water

5793.52 --> 5799.1990000000005
and not in like oceanic

5796.0 --> 5800.56
pollution areas

5799.199 --> 5802.638999999999
will they be

5800.56 --> 5804.56
as bad for you

5802.639 --> 5806.56
i don't know

5804.56 --> 5808.320000000001
like i can't tell because i don't eat

5806.56 --> 5810.639
shellfish

5808.32 --> 5812.48
because i don't like it

5810.639 --> 5814.4800000000005
but i'm just saying i think that every

5812.48 --> 5817.199
time something like that is mentioned it

5814.48 --> 5818.638999999999
always has to do with just like no

5817.199 --> 5821.04
bad [ __ ]

5818.639 --> 5823.84
poison in them and they

5821.04 --> 5825.84
didn't really have that elaborate and

5823.84 --> 5827.360000000001
understanding about all that and they

5825.84 --> 5831.119000000001
would also be

5827.36 --> 5833.199
in all these air eras

5831.119 --> 5835.119
they would just accept this is how

5833.199 --> 5839.719
people do things like oh you have a pig

5835.119 --> 5839.719
oh so that means you have a garbage can

5840.4 --> 5845.199
like why would you do anything else with

5842.96 --> 5846.88
it that's what you use pigs for right

5845.199 --> 5851.119
you can eat them and then it's like the

5846.88 --> 5851.119
biblical person says no no no that's bad

5851.28 --> 5855.44
but they yeah they just had another

5853.76 --> 5858.8
approach of explaining it right that's

5855.44 --> 5858.799999999999
how i kind of think about it

5860.4 --> 5864.5599999999995
and personally i i don't eat pig either

5863.679 --> 5868.639
so

5864.56 --> 5871.360000000001
yeah i'm being kind of weird about it

5868.639 --> 5873.4400000000005
on one hand i i don't actually eat those

5871.36 --> 5875.759999999999
things but on the other hand i think it

5873.44 --> 5877.599999999999
is debatable

5875.76 --> 5881.56
like why

5877.6 --> 5881.56
it's recommended against

5885.52 --> 5891.040000000001
people still put all their pollution in

5887.92 --> 5894.96
the ocean no no they don't

5891.04 --> 5897.44
not like they used to aries cursed man

5894.96 --> 5900.159
you highly underestimate like mining

5897.44 --> 5902.08
industry pollution even in medieval

5900.159 --> 5903.28
times

5902.08 --> 5905.76
like

5903.28 --> 5908.719
and even much later like people would

5905.76 --> 5911.1990000000005
literally just have freaking mercury to

5908.719 --> 5913.92
get gold out of ore

5911.199 --> 5916.799999999999
and they would just splash that [ __ ] all

5913.92 --> 5918.56
over the place man they didn't know they

5916.8 --> 5920.8
didn't care oh yeah some of the workers

5918.56 --> 5922.719
might go insane at some point who gives

5920.8 --> 5923.6
a [ __ ] right the king doesn't give a

5922.719 --> 5925.119
[ __ ]

5923.6 --> 5928.4800000000005
whatever

5925.119 --> 5931.119
but yeah poisonous poisons constantly

5928.48 --> 5932.879999999999
yet they don't do that anymore

5931.119 --> 5935.44
it's not allowed

5932.88 --> 5937.679
that's called environmental pollution

5935.44 --> 5939.839999999999
you get a problem when you do that

5937.679 --> 5943.28
right so it's not the same there's other

5939.84 --> 5946.32
types of pollution problems now

5943.28 --> 5948.719
new unknown chemicals and like micro

5946.32 --> 5951.119
plastics so the issues never really run

5948.719 --> 5953.679
out with industry it's just saying in

5951.119 --> 5955.36
those times they also had pollution

5953.679 --> 5958.08
problems and they didn't do anything

5955.36 --> 5960.4
about it and they didn't even know

5958.08 --> 5962.88
what the direct consequences were or

5960.4 --> 5964.879999999999
they just not tell anybody

5962.88 --> 5966.88
because they were in power and the

5964.88 --> 5968.719
people didn't need to know because who

5966.88 --> 5971.119
gave a [ __ ] because you're in power

5968.719 --> 5972.96
right who gives a [ __ ] about openness of

5971.119 --> 5975.44
information in the ancient times it's

5972.96 --> 5977.199
just like no control and that means

5975.44 --> 5978.08
information control too so if you're

5977.199 --> 5981.04
gonna have

5978.08 --> 5983.199
industrial pollution you of course don't

5981.04 --> 5986.159
tell anybody

5983.199 --> 5989.28
and if you find if they find out

5986.159 --> 5991.199
that's problematic

5989.28 --> 5994.48
you've imprisoned them

5991.199 --> 5997.36
yeah that's ancient times doesn't work

5994.48 --> 5997.36
like that anymore

6005.84 --> 6010.719
yeah aries cursed man yeah the problems

6007.84 --> 6010.719
aren't over yet

6010.96 --> 6018.08
but it's not like it used to be

6015.119 --> 6020.48
because industrial processes don't end

6018.08 --> 6023.679
up with the same materials anymore

6020.48 --> 6025.919999999999
because it's not allowed like nowhere

6023.679 --> 6027.1990000000005
but yes there is still garbage there is

6025.92 --> 6030.719
still

6027.199 --> 6030.719
junk leftovers

6032.88 --> 6037.28
but it's like it's not like oh oh let's

6035.6 --> 6040.56
just

6037.28 --> 6041.679
on a daily basis just

6040.56 --> 6046.080000000001
put

6041.679 --> 6048.719
a thousand gallons of benzene byproduct

6046.08 --> 6051.5199999999995
just right there that doesn't happen

6048.719 --> 6054.4800000000005
anymore if you know what i mean but it

6051.52 --> 6056.320000000001
might have happened 200 years ago

6054.48 --> 6058.5599999999995
but it's just like oh well we got this

6056.32 --> 6062.159
garbage just dump it in what no they

6058.56 --> 6064.080000000001
don't do that anymore it's not allowed

6062.159 --> 6066.879999999999
like nowhere it might still happen in

6064.08 --> 6070.8
like third world countries and that

6066.88 --> 6073.4400000000005
totally [ __ ] up everything

6070.8 --> 6075.52
destroys the wildlife destroys

6073.44 --> 6077.199
agriculture it destroys everything where

6075.52 --> 6079.360000000001
they do that that's why they kind of

6077.199 --> 6081.678999999999
stop doing that

6079.36 --> 6081.679
see

6081.76 --> 6086.88
you're still not eating shellfish or pig

6083.84 --> 6090.4800000000005
well good for you i'm i won't either

6086.88 --> 6090.4800000000005
except for maybe crab chips

6091.04 --> 6094.8
i'm just saying there is a

6093.119 --> 6098.96
logical

6094.8 --> 6101.76
reason probably for why these things

6098.96 --> 6103.92
are declared that also has to do with

6101.76 --> 6105.280000000001
the industry of the times that's my

6103.92 --> 6106.719
suspicion

6105.28 --> 6109.119
right

6106.719 --> 6110.88
not laying any biblical claims i'm just

6109.119 --> 6113.5199999999995
asking like hey maybe you should

6110.88 --> 6116.8
carefully analyze that

6113.52 --> 6118.56
beyond just oh it is a cursed creature

6116.8 --> 6120.88
from god and all

6118.56 --> 6122.280000000001
that [ __ ] i'm so sick of that

6120.88 --> 6125.1990000000005
[ __ ]

6122.28 --> 6126.4
oversimplified retardation that people

6125.199 --> 6129.119
do

6126.4 --> 6131.679
why don't you think about logic

6129.119 --> 6135.04
why don't you actually try to figure out

6131.679 --> 6138.719
why instead of always like oh it's

6135.04 --> 6141.119
designed to be evil [ __ ]

6138.719 --> 6143.52
god doesn't design evil

6141.119 --> 6146.639
evil just arrives

6143.52 --> 6149.679
it's his natural consequence

6146.639 --> 6153.1990000000005
he doesn't design evil like symbols as

6149.679 --> 6156.56
well symbols are not evil

6153.199 --> 6159.5199999999995
evil has made symbols into evil the

6156.56 --> 6160.719
symbols are an evil

6159.52 --> 6163.040000000001
right

6160.719 --> 6167.679
and it goes for everything in the design

6163.04 --> 6167.679
that is my personal conviction

6172.639 --> 6177.639
right good

6174.08 --> 6177.639
glad you agree

6178.4 --> 6183.44
bacon wrapped shrimp

6180.32 --> 6183.44
is off the devil

6184.56 --> 6187.679
thank you for that cleary

6188.56 --> 6191.56
oh

6197.28 --> 6200.5199999999995
that's hilarious

6233.76 --> 6239.360000000001
all right i by the way did absolutely

6236.0 --> 6242.96
not shy away from bacon as a kid

6239.36 --> 6246.839999999999
i kind of started to shy away after

6242.96 --> 6246.84
i think i was like 15.

6248.56 --> 6253.679
but as a kid i was like bacon bacon

6250.719 --> 6256.4
bacon bacon and eggs

6253.679 --> 6256.4
bacon with

6259.04 --> 6263.44
typical dutch meals where you have like

6261.679 --> 6265.1990000000005
potatoes and

6263.44 --> 6268.4
meat

6265.199 --> 6270.879999999999
and some vegetables and then the bacon

6268.4 --> 6273.44
sauerkraut bacon of course what is

6270.88 --> 6275.6
sauerkraut without bacon

6273.44 --> 6277.119
right all that so i love my bacon as a

6275.6 --> 6278.719
kid i just

6277.119 --> 6281.5199999999995
stopped

6278.719 --> 6281.52
i'll just stop

6286.08 --> 6291.76
i don't eat it i like haven't

6288.4 --> 6293.679
touched any sort of bacon in

6291.76 --> 6297.6
very long time

6293.679 --> 6299.679
like that has to be at least 15 years

6297.6 --> 6301.679
like not even touched

6299.679 --> 6305.679
and the thing is i don't even have to

6301.679 --> 6308.159
ask people like what is this

6305.679 --> 6311.1990000000005
if it is pork of any sort i could

6308.159 --> 6311.199
literally smell it

6312.159 --> 6316.879999999999
and then it's like oh not for me i guess

6314.96 --> 6318.32
i'm a really good

6316.88 --> 6320.08
trained

6318.32 --> 6323.199
jew like that

6320.08 --> 6327.6
in a way i do like to think of me to be

6323.199 --> 6330.638999999999
a a bacon jew like i don't do that

6327.6 --> 6332.96
i did actually lend it from that first

6330.639 --> 6337.119
before i realized that

6332.96 --> 6337.119
islam also doesn't allow bacon

6338.4 --> 6343.08
no bacon metal for me woohoo

6344.8 --> 6348.159000000001
and i do feel better for it

6348.32 --> 6353.28
all right the only real thing about it

6350.239 --> 6355.839999999999
that i miss is just the taste explosion

6353.28 --> 6358.88
but dude i've i've retracted from

6355.84 --> 6361.119000000001
pursuing that because i don't eat msg

6358.88 --> 6363.6
anymore

6361.119 --> 6365.759999999999
i don't have cut down on sugar

6363.6 --> 6368.56
dramatically and then when i do it back

6365.76 --> 6369.360000000001
i get serious consequences

6368.56 --> 6372.400000000001
right

6369.36 --> 6375.5199999999995
so i don't pursue like ooh tasty tasty

6372.4 --> 6377.759999999999
more tasty absolutely don't and so bacon

6375.52 --> 6379.280000000001
is just like well that was really the

6377.76 --> 6380.4800000000005
only thing that it was appealing about

6379.28 --> 6384.159
it anyway

6380.48 --> 6384.159
so i'm not really missing it at all

6385.199 --> 6391.44
right now my next challenge is cheese

6389.36 --> 6395.759999999999
i don't actually eat cheese anymore but

6391.44 --> 6395.759999999999
i do still like cheese flavor things

6398.239 --> 6404.5599999999995
msg is not bad for you

6401.36 --> 6407.28
what the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

6404.56 --> 6407.280000000001
yes it is

6408.96 --> 6412.679
yes it is

6415.199 --> 6418.638999999999
like

6416.0 --> 6419.84
palpably so have you ever tried eating

6418.639 --> 6422.639
it

6419.84 --> 6425.84
it's infamous for inducing heart attacks

6422.639 --> 6428.88
in people with heart problems infamous

6425.84 --> 6432.400000000001
and it literally has terrible byproducts

6428.88 --> 6432.400000000001
that are created in your liver

6432.96 --> 6435.44
like

6433.76 --> 6437.52
yeah it is

6435.44 --> 6439.759999999999
what the [ __ ] dude

6437.52 --> 6443.84
yeah it is

6439.76 --> 6443.84
msg is not good for you

6446.32 --> 6450.4
like

6448.0 --> 6452.96
i was into that

6450.4 --> 6454.879999999999
even 20 years ago

6452.96 --> 6457.84
i know what i'm talking about it's not

6454.88 --> 6457.84
good for you

6458.48 --> 6464.638999999999
look what msg yeah monosodium glutamate

6461.28 --> 6464.639
i know what it's made up

6468.84 --> 6473.679
of yeah you do you know what it does do

6472.0 --> 6475.28
you know what it actually does to your

6473.679 --> 6479.36
system

6475.28 --> 6480.239
it literally fools your stomach

6479.36 --> 6484.0
into

6480.239 --> 6485.839999999999
a sensation that you're more hungry

6484.0 --> 6488.4
and it disrupts

6485.84 --> 6491.1990000000005
it literally disrupts

6488.4 --> 6494.159
like food assimilation it's bad it's not

6491.199 --> 6496.32
good for you like in minor amounts it's

6494.159 --> 6498.638999999999
not super harmful

6496.32 --> 6501.04
but yeah

6498.639 --> 6503.6
if you continually use it it's going to

6501.04 --> 6506.239
basically change how you function

6503.6 --> 6508.719
it's not good for you

6506.239 --> 6511.759999999999
also it makes you fat

6508.719 --> 6514.08
literally it's dissolvable in fat it

6511.76 --> 6516.159000000001
literally if you eat too much it starts

6514.08 --> 6519.36
piling in fat layers influencing your

6516.159 --> 6520.879999999999
entire hormonal system yeah it is bad i

6519.36 --> 6522.0
know what the [ __ ] i'm talking about

6520.88 --> 6526.52
dude

6522.0 --> 6526.52
what planet have you been living on

6530.08 --> 6534.4
it is safe well it's officially declared

6532.32 --> 6535.84
safe right but

6534.4 --> 6537.599999999999
yeah it's even

6535.84 --> 6540.88
inorganic food

6537.6 --> 6543.04
i just avoid it

6540.88 --> 6545.4400000000005
because it's not healthy for you i

6543.04 --> 6548.0
literally avoid it i don't eat chips

6545.44 --> 6552.08
with msg in it even if it's supposedly

6548.0 --> 6554.88
organically created msg because msg is

6552.08 --> 6557.599
a type of molecule you don't want to eat

6554.88 --> 6560.2390000000005
it's not supportive of your health

6557.599 --> 6562.32
you see it's detrimental to your health

6560.239 --> 6564.4
it's a little taste sensation there's

6562.32 --> 6566.4
another substance that also does that

6564.4 --> 6569.119
it's also very appealing to people it's

6566.4 --> 6571.5199999999995
called sugar now that one is recognized

6569.119 --> 6574.0
as directly poisonous

6571.52 --> 6576.96
but still it's in a lot of stuff it's

6574.0 --> 6580.32
allowed right it's officially so yeah

6576.96 --> 6581.199
msg and sugar refined sugar are really

6580.32 --> 6584.159
not

6581.199 --> 6587.199
all that different in the end result

6584.159 --> 6589.92
so yeah it's very yummy i i get it right

6587.199 --> 6592.879999999999
it's very difficult to step off from

6589.92 --> 6595.04
that it's not healthy for you though

6592.88 --> 6596.719
it absolutely is it has been very

6595.04 --> 6599.599
elaborate studies

6596.719 --> 6599.599
very elaborate

6603.28 --> 6607.36
so i don't know what you're talking

6604.719 --> 6608.88
about you have no proof

6607.36 --> 6611.839999999999
nope dude

6608.88 --> 6611.84
the [ __ ]

6618.239 --> 6623.119
what

6620.56 --> 6625.4400000000005
will gaston are you a

6623.119 --> 6627.598999999999
a numpty

6625.44 --> 6629.678999999999
are you actually saying

6627.599 --> 6631.1990000000005
msg is not bad for you and the earth is

6629.679 --> 6633.4400000000005
a globe is that what you're saying right

6631.199 --> 6633.44
now

6634.08 --> 6637.119
very typical if that were the case i

6635.92 --> 6638.8
would get it

6637.119 --> 6640.32
because yeah

6638.8 --> 6642.2390000000005
you know

6640.32 --> 6645.5199999999995
you're an empty then

6642.239 --> 6645.5199999999995
show the studies dude

6646.96 --> 6651.119
why did you actually look look it up for

6649.36 --> 6654.4
example in

6651.119 --> 6656.639
natural news natural news has had

6654.4 --> 6659.639999999999
studies about it since it started up

6656.639 --> 6662.7390000000005
since that website started up in

6659.64 --> 6662.7390000000005
[Music]

6665.36 --> 6669.839999999999
msg in certain vaccines

6668.08 --> 6672.8
for a while

6669.84 --> 6673.92
yeah crazy [ __ ] i learned that like 10

6672.8 --> 6675.84
years ago

6673.92 --> 6677.92
they actually put that in certain flu

6675.84 --> 6679.679
vaccines if i'm not mistaken could have

6677.92 --> 6683.04
been another one

6679.679 --> 6683.04
that's freaky [ __ ]

6693.119 --> 6695.839999999999
oh that's interesting

6701.84 --> 6707.84
okay if you have msg problems apparently

6705.199 --> 6710.719
if you take magnesium

6707.84 --> 6713.28
that kind of resolves it a little that's

6710.719 --> 6713.28
interesting

6714.4 --> 6717.119
right so

6720.8 --> 6725.119000000001
dude the amount of

6723.599 --> 6727.4400000000005
works

6725.119 --> 6729.839999999999
about msg is endless and that's not

6727.44 --> 6732.32
surprising because it was discovered in

6729.84 --> 6734.639
1908

6732.32 --> 6737.28
japanese invention

6734.639 --> 6739.28
it was made as a preservative

6737.28 --> 6741.92
right well anything that's

6739.28 --> 6744.08
usually made as a preservative

6741.92 --> 6745.28
especially if it's chemically made which

6744.08 --> 6747.04
it is

6745.28 --> 6748.96
is

6747.04 --> 6752.08
not healthy

6748.96 --> 6754.56
they put in poison that's the mechanism

6752.08 --> 6757.44
put in poison in the food so it doesn't

6754.56 --> 6760.320000000001
rot as quickly and you can

6757.44 --> 6762.638999999999
store it longer it's more efficient

6760.32 --> 6766.08
right that's why they do it not because

6762.639 --> 6768.32
it's healthy in the contrary

6766.08 --> 6770.719
right that's why organic food spoils a

6768.32 --> 6774.08
lot quicker because it doesn't have the

6770.719 --> 6776.84
same toxic crap in it to keep it give it

6774.08 --> 6780.239
a longer shelf life

6776.84 --> 6782.400000000001
yeah and that's the reason why it was

6780.239 --> 6784.879999999999
invented okay

6782.4 --> 6787.28
to increase shelf life that's why msg

6784.88 --> 6789.52
was invented to increase shelf life

6787.28 --> 6792.48
that's why it was invented to increase

6789.52 --> 6795.040000000001
shelf life it was invented to increase

6792.48 --> 6796.5199999999995
shelf life okay

6795.04 --> 6798.239
that's

6796.52 --> 6800.400000000001
self-revealing

6798.239 --> 6803.799999999999
i shouldn't have to explain more about

6800.4 --> 6803.799999999999
this to you

6811.92 --> 6816.4800000000005
i'm crying by asking yeah i have read

6814.48 --> 6819.36
the studies will gaston

6816.48 --> 6821.28
in this period i was studying up a lot

6819.36 --> 6822.88
and i have read

6821.28 --> 6825.119
papers

6822.88 --> 6828.0
large amount of papers wasn't the only

6825.119 --> 6828.0
one by the way

6828.08 --> 6831.76
it's a lot of reading of studies back

6830.08 --> 6833.119
then yeah and msg is one of the studies

6831.76 --> 6836.8
that i did read

6833.119 --> 6838.32
it just happens to be freaking

6836.8 --> 6842.2390000000005
somewhere between

6838.32 --> 6844.5599999999995
11 and 15 years ago so yeah i don't have

6842.239 --> 6846.48
that stored on this computer

6844.56 --> 6848.56
because that's like three computers ago

6846.48 --> 6849.5199999999995
or something this is i don't know where

6848.56 --> 6851.52
that is

6849.52 --> 6853.280000000001
i don't even know if if the pages still

6851.52 --> 6855.1990000000005
exist where i got that now they should

6853.28 --> 6860.239
be because some of it was

6855.199 --> 6860.239
related to pubmed and pubmed things stay

6860.8 --> 6866.08
so

6863.679 --> 6869.76
cold increases shelf life

6866.08 --> 6871.76
yeah but coal also requires electricity

6869.76 --> 6873.679
huh

6871.76 --> 6876.719
yeah you can't just have a freaking

6873.679 --> 6879.04
refrigerator everywhere you go

6876.719 --> 6881.04
right especially in the hot regions so

6879.04 --> 6882.719
yeah that's really nice cold does

6881.04 --> 6884.96
increase shelf life

6882.719 --> 6886.4
but

6884.96 --> 6887.92
then it means you got to have a

6886.4 --> 6890.4
refrigerator and that's where you're

6887.92 --> 6892.159
going to store it if you want it on the

6890.4 --> 6892.96
shelves

6892.159 --> 6895.5199999999995
well

6892.96 --> 6896.719
you can have it at a slightly colder

6895.52 --> 6899.76
than normal

6896.719 --> 6902.88
room temperature perhaps

6899.76 --> 6904.88
but you're not gonna have your store in

6902.88 --> 6905.92
a giant refrigerator

6904.88 --> 6907.84
yeah

6905.92 --> 6912.96
so yeah

6907.84 --> 6912.96
shelf life msg is for shelf life

6916.239 --> 6920.718999999999
yeah yeah it does almost seem like he is

6918.56 --> 6923.84
an msg salesman peaceful warrior it's

6920.719 --> 6923.84
quite bizarre this

6926.48 --> 6930.36
you're a weirdo dude

6932.56 --> 6936.320000000001
it's not mainstream belief

6934.719 --> 6939.44
it's true

6936.32 --> 6942.96
i've experienced it i've literally had

6939.44 --> 6944.799999999999
pretty severe stomach problems

6942.96 --> 6946.4800000000005
stomach problems

6944.8 --> 6949.84
because of msg

6946.48 --> 6951.759999999999
i've had that a lot in my youth

6949.84 --> 6953.679
a lot yeah

6951.76 --> 6955.76
as soon as i stopped it

6953.679 --> 6958.159
everything started to work better i

6955.76 --> 6960.96
started to clear up i felt less

6958.159 --> 6963.28
miserable i had less

6960.96 --> 6963.28
like

6963.76 --> 6966.56
what do you call that

6966.8 --> 6971.04
the certain uh histamine

6971.52 --> 6975.360000000001
rushes

6972.56 --> 6978.159000000001
which like are like painful sometimes i

6975.36 --> 6980.5599999999995
got histamine rushes from msg that were

6978.159 --> 6983.28
literally painful sometimes if i

6980.56 --> 6986.56
overdone it if i ate like an entire bags

6983.28 --> 6988.5599999999995
bag of msg chips and i did that as a kid

6986.56 --> 6990.080000000001
it was very silly

6988.56 --> 6993.76
and would get sick and it would get

6990.08 --> 6996.0
these rash no msg is freaking terrible

6993.76 --> 6996.0
yeah

6996.639 --> 7003.76
it is not good for you

7000.4 --> 7007.5199999999995
i have physical personal proof of that

7003.76 --> 7007.52
i have gone through it

7011.76 --> 7016.8
and yeah dude

7014.0 --> 7020.0
stop whining about no proof dude just

7016.8 --> 7020.0
go to natural news

7020.32 --> 7025.04
type in

7021.44 --> 7027.199
msg just the three letters msg

7025.04 --> 7028.84
boom

7027.199 --> 7031.598999999999
thousands

7028.84 --> 7033.76
thousands pages

7031.599 --> 7037.4400000000005
nah not thousands hundreds of pages

7033.76 --> 7039.76
probably i haven't even seen the

7037.44 --> 7043.04
the extent of it

7039.76 --> 7045.84
and there's just a lot of input a lot of

7043.04 --> 7045.84
input

7047.52 --> 7051.92
going back decades

7049.84 --> 7054.56
decades

7051.92 --> 7056.2390000000005
and it's still there so yeah oh you

7054.56 --> 7058.719
can't find anything well then that means

7056.239 --> 7061.28
you didn't search for it because there

7058.719 --> 7063.84
is definitely a lot of evidence that msg

7061.28 --> 7065.599
is not good for you and it is accepted

7063.84 --> 7067.4400000000005
mainstream

7065.599 --> 7069.04
because it's just

7067.44 --> 7070.96
it is what it is

7069.04 --> 7075.92
it's still legal though you can still

7070.96 --> 7075.92
put it in food it's just not recommended

7076.4 --> 7082.48
like a doctor would never

7078.96 --> 7082.4800000000005
recommend msg to you

7082.8 --> 7087.0
like it doesn't solve anything

7087.28 --> 7094.719
only creates problems and that's it

7091.119 --> 7097.119
