so yeah please keep the support

113.84 --> 118.799
right

115.36 --> 121.92
so as you can already see

118.799 --> 126.24000000000001
it's hot again let's predict it although

121.92 --> 126.24000000000001
there are a few clouds today so woohoo

127.119 --> 131.2
kind of actually kind of happy to see

128.879 --> 131.2
them

132.08 --> 138.8
right not everywhere though and yeah it

134.4 --> 138.8
seems like they have been trailing again

139.2 --> 143.83999999999997
so

141.44 --> 143.84
yeah

144.8 --> 149.59900000000002
guess they're building up back to uh

147.599 --> 151.599
rainstorm again which is supposed to be

149.599 --> 154.23899999999998
happening tomorrow or

151.599 --> 154.23899999999998
tuesday

155.599 --> 159.2
but yeah it is a really nice day that i

157.92 --> 161.51899999999998
haven't actually

159.2 --> 164.39999999999998
been out for groceries

161.519 --> 165.68
because i did that yesterday

164.4 --> 168.08
again

165.68 --> 171.84
to get for today so it would just

168.08 --> 171.84
not have to get all overheated

172.239 --> 179.04
before i start the show

175.2 --> 179.04
i think that was a good choice

180.08 --> 184.44000000000003
because it is really hot out there

188.64 --> 191.64
alright

193.62 --> 196.81900000000002
[Music]

198.95 --> 203.11999999999998
[Music]

200.8 --> 203.12
hmm

206.239 --> 210.48000000000002
nobody seems to have arrived yet

210.799 --> 218.04000000000002
oh well

212.4 --> 218.04
it is sunday the 14th of august 2022

219.36 --> 221.76000000000002
and

225.68 --> 230.4
yeah it's warm

228.08 --> 232.72
i still feel i can talk about plenty of

230.4 --> 232.72
things

233.36 --> 237.36
because yeah there is this nice wind

235.439 --> 239.439
like even in the night it just came

237.36 --> 241.84
through like i keep my door open because

239.439 --> 243.04
nobody else is home anyway

241.84 --> 245.519
sometimes

243.04 --> 248.56
wind just comes blowing through and then

245.519 --> 252.48000000000002
even as i'm laying on the bed

248.56 --> 252.48
i get some of that it's really nice

253.12 --> 259.28000000000003
so yeah i went to bed very late today

256.56 --> 261.6
ah hello pjc net first in chat good to

259.28 --> 261.59999999999997
see you

262.72 --> 267.199
uh

264.16 --> 269.6
yeah late it was late late late

267.199 --> 271.68
and it blamed jared

269.6 --> 273.52000000000004
he had his live stream with a lot of

271.68 --> 277.04
callers

273.52 --> 277.919
and it was just really interesting i was

277.04 --> 279.44
a bit

277.919 --> 281.68
annoyed here in there but it's not

279.44 --> 284.08
surprising i mean he was basically just

281.68 --> 287.04
going into triggerable territory and he

284.08 --> 289.19899999999996
knew it and he announced it and all that

287.04 --> 291.12
it's very interesting all kinds of

289.199 --> 292.72
different callers with all kinds of

291.12 --> 294.84000000000003
different views

292.72 --> 296.8
on christianity

294.84 --> 297.84
and

296.8 --> 299.91900000000004
yeah

297.84 --> 303.84
it was interesting

299.919 --> 303.84
anyway that kept me up all night

305.84 --> 311.19899999999996
and yeah kiwi and

309.36 --> 313.68
qe live

311.199 --> 318.0
no it was ball busters actually but

313.68 --> 318.0
there were technical difficulties and

320.8 --> 325.36
it didn't last super long

322.88 --> 327.6
it kind of

325.36 --> 330.40000000000003
i yeah at some point i just went to make

327.6 --> 332.0
dinner very late

330.4 --> 333.35999999999996
and then i came back and it was already

332.0 --> 336.24
over so

333.36 --> 338.8
but anyway i did get a couple of uh

336.24 --> 341.6
comments in here and there

338.8 --> 343.199
not all that many

341.6 --> 344.56
but yeah it was all about ether of

343.199 --> 346.24
course so it's

344.56 --> 348.8
like

346.24 --> 351.6
all the guys and kiwi and me we're all

348.8 --> 354.639
pretty much attuned to the same

351.6 --> 354.639
concept with that

357.919 --> 365.24
hmm

359.28 --> 365.23999999999995
hello by the way terry 306 and

368.96 --> 374.08
yeah an obvious troll i'm not even gonna

371.6 --> 374.08000000000004
name you

374.56 --> 381.0
uh

376.319 --> 381.0
right because i'm not doing it anymore

381.43 --> 384.619
[Music]

388.479 --> 391.919
you know

389.6 --> 394.8
part of the objective of even showing my

391.919 --> 398.08
anger is to prove that i have it

394.8 --> 400.319
and to learn to gain control over it

398.08 --> 401.68
but yeah it seems to also have a side

400.319 --> 403.759
effect on

401.68 --> 405.52
psychopaths out there

403.759 --> 407.52000000000004
i don't know what they are

405.52 --> 410.15999999999997
exactly

407.52 --> 411.919
energy vampires and they just i don't

410.16 --> 413.03900000000004
know they really get off on when i do

411.919 --> 417.35999999999996
that

413.039 --> 417.36
i think it it probably reminds them of

417.599 --> 422.71999999999997
sort of a rough sense of what it like

419.52 --> 425.68
still to have a soul

422.72 --> 428.24
but yeah it's i'm not gonna get

425.68 --> 429.759
i'm just not gonna give them what they

428.24 --> 433.039
want you see i'm not gonna have a

429.759 --> 436.039
relationship like that

433.039 --> 436.039
so

437.28 --> 439.75899999999996
good luck

440.0 --> 445.36
don't suppress feelings right important

442.72 --> 447.03900000000004
of course and hey if i feel agitated for

445.36 --> 448.72
some reason i'm gonna express it and

447.039 --> 450.4
then the trolls will be oh it's because

448.72 --> 451.44000000000005
of me right oh

450.4 --> 453.12
no

451.44 --> 454.96
it's just because i happen to be really

453.12 --> 459.44
irritated that day it happens sometimes

454.96 --> 459.44
i kind of seem to have mood swings

460.08 --> 466.28
but yeah i attribute it to just being

462.4 --> 468.15999999999997
extra sensitive to the typical

466.28 --> 470.479
[Music]

468.16 --> 472.56
energies that are unleashed upon all of

470.479 --> 473.919
us

472.56 --> 474.34
in waves

473.919 --> 477.44
so

474.34 --> 477.44
[Music]

477.68 --> 482.08
hello gideon sick x320

482.72 --> 486.72
oh my god magnetic waves

488.479 --> 490.8
yeah

489.36 --> 493.199
there's this thing you know about

490.8 --> 494.879
magnetism and anytime magnetism becomes

493.199 --> 496.319
involved i still remember making that

494.879 --> 498.40000000000003
comment

496.319 --> 500.40000000000003
that is that

498.4 --> 502.87899999999996
magnetism

500.4 --> 504.84
is in the wave

502.879 --> 506.40000000000003
it's a

504.84 --> 507.919
field

506.4 --> 510.31899999999996
yeah

507.919 --> 513.919
magnetic field

510.319 --> 516.399
not a wave a field a very different

513.919 --> 520.64
concept

516.399 --> 521.839
and yeah it seems like ethereum

520.64 --> 523.519
theory

521.839 --> 525.44
etherealists

523.519 --> 528.64
ethereans

525.44 --> 530.5600000000001
they have just like oh no it's just

528.64 --> 532.399
no they're all connected so it doesn't

530.56 --> 534.2399999999999
matter they're completely different type

532.399 --> 535.839
of formats we're just gonna assume it's

534.24 --> 538.08
one thing they're doing the same thing

535.839 --> 540.72
as

538.08 --> 543.6800000000001
the original science refires that said

540.72 --> 546.72
oh no it's all just one spectrum

543.68 --> 549.76
right but light and magnetism and it's

546.72 --> 550.9590000000001
all one thing really no no it isn't like

549.76 --> 555.4399999999999
not at all

550.959 --> 558.4399999999999
that's a reified nonsense claim

555.44 --> 562.1600000000001
based on like this weird religious

558.44 --> 565.6
unification of all things within the

562.16 --> 567.8389999999999
science community

565.6 --> 569.9200000000001
it's what they'd like to do no it's all

567.839 --> 574.08
one thing but no god in there of course

569.92 --> 574.0799999999999
right so but it's all one thing

574.56 --> 579.1199999999999
so

576.88 --> 580.24
i'm not yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna point

579.12 --> 582.16
that out oh

580.24 --> 585.04
sorry i'm

582.16 --> 585.04
gonna freeze

586.24 --> 589.399
it's glitching

590.24 --> 592.72
weird

594.88 --> 599.68
anyway

596.08 --> 599.6800000000001
i gotta notice that i'll just

601.279 --> 606.88
see if that makes it stop

603.839 --> 606.8800000000001
stupid flickering

607.279 --> 609.279
anyway

608.24 --> 613.519
hello

609.279 --> 613.519
fluttersage matthew hall good to see you

616.079 --> 620.4799999999999
hurry up today

618.0 --> 620.48
yeah yeah

621.36 --> 626.0790000000001
probably the last hot super hot day of

624.0 --> 627.12
summer okay

626.079 --> 632.279
i don't know

627.12 --> 632.279
i mean august isn't over just yet

638.56 --> 642.8
what

640.24 --> 645.6
okay x320

642.8 --> 649.12
spend 100 on water

645.6 --> 649.12
why didn't you just bring your own

649.519 --> 653.92
like

651.76 --> 656.399
get some cooling elements

653.92 --> 657.68
like a good insulated back cooling

656.399 --> 660.16
elements and

657.68 --> 663.3599999999999
just like two big bottles of water like

660.16 --> 665.1999999999999
why the hell would you spend 100

663.36 --> 667.04
buying water

665.2 --> 670.279
it's ridiculous it's probably not even

667.04 --> 670.279
good water

674.3 --> 679.399
[Music]

676.399 --> 679.399
well

690.399 --> 696.0
yeah matthew hall it's been a few days

693.2 --> 696.0
yeah i'm okay

696.399 --> 701.279
i'm still a little desperate for cash as

698.399 --> 703.2
usual but yeah it's been it's been good

701.279 --> 704.16
it's been good it's yeah i'm getting

703.2 --> 706.8000000000001
around

704.16 --> 709.04
but yeah i'm also pretty inspired and

706.8 --> 710.959
not like angry

709.04 --> 713.04
as much

710.959 --> 715.76
it's like too hot to get angry it

713.04 --> 719.92
literally is it's like it mean if you if

715.76 --> 719.92
you get angry in this weather it's like

721.2 --> 724.639
immediately overheating

726.56 --> 729.56
so

733.839 --> 738.639
you don't allow inside oh

735.92 --> 741.639
in a club

738.639 --> 741.639
what

744.32 --> 750.399
went to a parade in a club

748.079 --> 750.399
what

753.279 --> 759.12
was it like sort of a outdoor festival

756.0 --> 763.32
thing and you can bring your own drinks

759.12 --> 763.32
okay that makes sense

772.639 --> 777.12
the house party

774.88 --> 779.47
all right i hope you had fun despite all

777.12 --> 783.369
that

779.47 --> 783.369
[Music]

786.56 --> 791.8389999999999
tried to order gusto energy drink but

788.88 --> 793.279
they only shipped to the uk

791.839 --> 795.6800000000001
oh

793.279 --> 795.68
really

797.279 --> 800.6
that's weird

804.72 --> 810.6800000000001
oh talking about which

807.04 --> 810.68
i think i might have

844.0 --> 849.279
ah

846.24 --> 851.519
it's even just for doing this

849.279 --> 854.079
ow

851.519 --> 857.079
stabbing my own eye out

[Music]

874.0 --> 879.199

877.199 --> 882.68
challenge glad you

879.199 --> 882.68
you did it

917.199 --> 919.8389999999999
anyway

918.32 --> 922.1600000000001
uh

919.839 --> 922.1600000000001
see

924.8 --> 928.399
i already finished watching home

926.72 --> 930.639
benjamin it's like

928.399 --> 930.639
what

930.8 --> 935.8
i've been catching up too much during

932.639 --> 935.8
the weekdays

941.279 --> 946.639
oh yeah also before the show i was

943.839 --> 948.639
watching a video from mine unveiled

946.639 --> 950.0
about charles

948.639 --> 952.24
charleston

950.0 --> 954.8
unveiled

952.24 --> 956.88
it's an extremely long show i've gotten

954.8 --> 959.279
into it like an hour and 20 minutes but

956.88 --> 962.56
it is so interesting

959.279 --> 965.6
despite his like kind of horrific

962.56 --> 967.5189999999999
monotone voice

965.6 --> 969.279
i don't i don't really like his voice

967.519 --> 971.6
but his

969.279 --> 974.24
like his input is extremely

971.6 --> 975.1990000000001
interesting and it is like calm

974.24 --> 977.839
at least

975.199 --> 979.92
it is focused

977.839 --> 981.9200000000001
very interesting

979.92 --> 983.759
i guess i'll be continue watching that

981.92 --> 985.92
later

983.759 --> 987.839
and by the way this was out like a week

985.92 --> 990.88
ago

987.839 --> 990.8800000000001
for some reason i

991.279 --> 997.48
skipped out on it you want to check it

dude the last time i've been to any is

1012.639 --> 1016.48
i don't even remember how long ago

1020.8 --> 1024.04
let's see

1025.6 --> 1030.3999999999999
right

1027.28 --> 1030.3999999999999
i think that was like

1032.24 --> 1036.959
like right after

1034.16 --> 1038.4
my ex broke up with me

1036.959 --> 1041.199
uh

1038.4 --> 1041.199
camera freeze

1043.22 --> 1047.839
[Music]

1045.679 --> 1049.76
right

1047.839 --> 1052.8799999999999
now that's not entirely true i think it

1049.76 --> 1055.76
was 2015

1052.88 --> 1057.679
but yeah one of my friends that

1055.76 --> 1059.76
since then like

1057.679 --> 1061.2800000000002
we sort of broke apart because of flat

1059.76 --> 1063.76
earth

1061.28 --> 1066.24
we were always

1063.76 --> 1068.0
having a very elaborate intellectual

1066.24 --> 1070.72
conversations with like a lot of

1068.0 --> 1073.36
research and literature references

1070.72 --> 1074.799
really good conversations over the phone

1073.36 --> 1076.799
hours

1074.799 --> 1079.44
but at some point i kind of just

1076.799 --> 1081.84
insisted about flat earth because of the

1079.44 --> 1084.3200000000002
design aspects of it

1081.84 --> 1084.32
and

1085.039 --> 1091.44
and then it like cockney's different

1087.44 --> 1095.44
dissonance really like started to set in

1091.44 --> 1098.24
and yeah after that eventually like

1095.44 --> 1101.2
yeah well i also came out basically for

1098.24 --> 1102.96
homophobia which was not exactly helpful

1101.2 --> 1104.96
since

1102.96 --> 1108.88
he

1104.96 --> 1110.48
was effectively a she

1108.88 --> 1112.5590000000002
very interesting person though

1110.48 --> 1114.0
intellectually

1112.559 --> 1115.6789999999999
but uh

1114.0 --> 1118.4
yeah that's still from

1115.679 --> 1124.0800000000002
an old friend from the gothic days like

1118.4 --> 1124.0800000000002
ethan's from since before my ex but like

1124.32 --> 1129.039
it doesn't work anymore we've drifted

1126.559 --> 1132.559
apart too much in frequency

1129.039 --> 1134.16
he is too much this she

1132.559 --> 1137.84
that's ridiculous

1134.16 --> 1137.8400000000001
too much of a

1138.72 --> 1144.48
too much sunken in with like

1141.679 --> 1146.4
the liberal conditioning

1144.48 --> 1148.96
but still with a lot of innocent

1146.4 --> 1150.48
philosophical backing

1148.96 --> 1153.1200000000001
right and

1150.48 --> 1157.44
he she is a good person

1153.12 --> 1159.52
naturally but dwelling very typical

1157.44 --> 1162.16
anyway

1159.52 --> 1163.12
i hope he's doing well she

1162.16 --> 1165.3600000000001
not

1163.12 --> 1166.1599999999999
gotten like any vaccine [ __ ] i really

1165.36 --> 1168.32
hope

1166.16 --> 1170.48
because it was a very smart good person

1168.32 --> 1172.5
but

1170.48 --> 1175.589
a bit naive in nature too so

1172.5 --> 1175.589
[Music]

1177.36 --> 1180.1
ah

1178.96 --> 1182.96
i haven't spoken in

1180.1 --> 1186.08
[Music]

1182.96 --> 1186.08
at least five years

1188.4 --> 1193.039
anyway sorry to bore you all that with

1190.96 --> 1195.039
all that ah

1193.039 --> 1197.44
yeah i don't go to parties

1195.039 --> 1201.679
really anymore either i don't just i

1197.44 --> 1201.679
don't have the money for it either and

1201.919 --> 1206.159
it's like

1203.44 --> 1208.24
it sounds weird but it's just that with

1206.159 --> 1210.48
my sensory range

1208.24 --> 1213.1200000000001
like i'm just not interested really in

1210.48 --> 1217.3600000000001
that anymore it used to work really well

1213.12 --> 1217.36
now i'm just much more interested in

1218.08 --> 1221.08
just

1222.96 --> 1228.0
natural connections between people

1225.679 --> 1232.8400000000001
especially between me and others that i

1228.0 --> 1232.84
might bump into that's interesting to me

1235.76 --> 1240.4
because parties most of the parties that

1238.08 --> 1243.4399999999998
i went to it's that like yeah okay the

1240.4 --> 1247.3600000000001
music might be not halfway bad like if

1243.44 --> 1250.0800000000002
the music is not halfway bad

1247.36 --> 1253.36
i'm like whoa best party ever because

1250.08 --> 1255.6
most of the time the music just really

1253.36 --> 1258.6399999999999
sucks

1255.6 --> 1264.32
i i i there's a lot of music that i

1258.64 --> 1266.96
really cannot stand at all i'm very

1264.32 --> 1269.039
musical critical sensitive

1266.96 --> 1271.52
just because of the way i am and how i

1269.039 --> 1271.52
grew up

1274.48 --> 1278.24
so

1275.6 --> 1280.6399999999999
i would have to do it for the people

1278.24 --> 1283.2
well there's not really a lot of people

1280.64 --> 1285.6000000000001
that like really that i connect with

1283.2 --> 1288.159
naturally it's a few and most of them

1285.6 --> 1291.1999999999998
seem to be like older

1288.159 --> 1292.96
which in a way like i guess okay

1291.2 --> 1294.799
in another way i'm like yeah but i do

1292.96 --> 1298.32
actually wish i could connect to

1294.799 --> 1299.44
somebody younger that is also like that

1298.32 --> 1302.559
this is

1299.44 --> 1302.559
especially female

1302.799 --> 1306.799
i'm not

1304.559 --> 1309.76
i'm not like ready for some like

1306.799 --> 1311.039
retirement relationship or something

1309.76 --> 1312.559
i want to

1311.039 --> 1316.12
give it a go

1312.559 --> 1316.12
i want to get serious

1321.36 --> 1324.81
right i mean yeah

1323.44 --> 1326.0800000000002
if i'd have like a

1324.81 --> 1328.1589999999999
[Music]

1326.08 --> 1329.6
a real friend circle that i really

1328.159 --> 1332.5590000000002
connected with and there would be

1329.6 --> 1334.559
parties that would really fit us

1332.559 --> 1337.28
yeah i go for it again that would be

1334.559 --> 1339.2
great it's kind of what also made a

1337.28 --> 1340.24
typical gothic part is that i went to

1339.2 --> 1343.44
work

1340.24 --> 1345.84
electro usually

1343.44 --> 1347.8400000000001
because i had somebody to go with

1345.84 --> 1350.72
friends

1347.84 --> 1354.0
now we could talk listen music

1350.72 --> 1356.72
make remarks i could like i have a let

1354.0 --> 1359.679
out for my intelligence

1356.72 --> 1362.32
with somebody else there that gets that

1359.679 --> 1364.48
because i am just like that and if i

1362.32 --> 1366.72
can't tell anybody

1364.48 --> 1368.799
what is going on inside of me because i

1366.72 --> 1372.96
know nobody out there

1368.799 --> 1376.48
is really isolating like i really don't

1372.96 --> 1378.72
like to go to parties alone

1376.48 --> 1381.44
i mean i have

1378.72 --> 1382.799
it's weird because it i can't really be

1381.44 --> 1384.159
myself

1382.799 --> 1386.08
then

1384.159 --> 1388.7990000000002
in a way

1386.08 --> 1391.28
or i'd have to be like really drunk on

1388.799 --> 1394.32
confidence type of sensation like i just

1391.28 --> 1396.559
accomplished something and i'm like yeah

1394.32 --> 1401.24
i want to show myself and then i don't

1396.559 --> 1401.24
give a [ __ ] if i'm alone but

1402.159 --> 1406.3200000000002
are very interesting times those are

1404.24 --> 1410.559
also the times where

1406.32 --> 1413.2
i had most relationships because of that

1410.559 --> 1415.84
right haven't had any of those moments

1413.2 --> 1418.24
recently but then again i i don't really

1415.84 --> 1420.3999999999999
have a

1418.24 --> 1420.4
a

1420.799 --> 1424.559
a connection like that with the gothic

1422.72 --> 1427.52
scene anymore it just

1424.559 --> 1430.32
i'm not that anymore

1427.52 --> 1432.6399999999999
i totally get it and i still appreciate

1430.32 --> 1434.6399999999999
like the style and i even appreciate the

1432.64 --> 1437.2
type of people and like i understand

1434.64 --> 1438.7990000000002
them i understand how you roll into that

1437.2 --> 1440.159
and what it's like and how different it

1438.799 --> 1443.12
is and

1440.159 --> 1445.919
it's very freeing

1443.12 --> 1448.8799999999999
in a spiritual way or it can be

1445.919 --> 1451.44
there's also like really sick

1448.88 --> 1453.7600000000002
dark people dwelling there too

1451.44 --> 1455.279
and you're really happy if they totally

1453.76 --> 1456.72
keep it to themselves and they're not

1455.279 --> 1459.52
overt about it because you have those

1456.72 --> 1461.76
two and those are just like really nasty

1459.52 --> 1464.32
people that everybody just like

1461.76 --> 1467.6
just don't look at them

1464.32 --> 1470.72
or they'll start talking to you nasty

1467.6 --> 1470.7199999999998
gross people

1471.12 --> 1475.4399999999998
right but not a lot of them

1473.52 --> 1478.559
most are just kind of normies they're

1475.44 --> 1479.6000000000001
like goth normies you have that too

1478.559 --> 1481.2
anyway

1479.6 --> 1482.7199999999998
or you used to i don't know what the

1481.2 --> 1485.52
scene is like i

1482.72 --> 1490.159
it's changed a lot and also the just

1485.52 --> 1492.6399999999999
this sjw thing has really slipped in

1490.159 --> 1495.0390000000002
it's like the gothic is

1492.64 --> 1498.0800000000002
has become attempt they have attempted

1495.039 --> 1501.84
to culturally like reforge it into like

1498.08 --> 1505.039
a sort of stupid rebellious thing

1501.84 --> 1508.32
that isn't really like gothic anymore

1505.039 --> 1510.1589999999999
it's either like really freaking dark

1508.32 --> 1512.84
and evil

1510.159 --> 1517.44
and like art art with

1512.84 --> 1518.3999999999999
evil or it's like gross stupid rebellion

1517.44 --> 1521.3600000000001
and like

1518.4 --> 1521.3600000000001
communism and

1521.679 --> 1528.24
it had that has slipped in those

1525.12 --> 1530.6399999999999
it was always kind of bordering that

1528.24 --> 1530.64
scene

1531.36 --> 1536.0
have sort of like comp communists or

1533.76 --> 1538.08
anti-capitalist

1536.0 --> 1539.76
sympathies and bans and all that and

1538.08 --> 1541.6
they were pretty cool music and they had

1539.76 --> 1545.2
good points about it right

1541.6 --> 1545.1999999999998
but that has actually

1545.6 --> 1549.84
they haven't like

1548.4 --> 1551.679
maybe they have really learned their

1549.84 --> 1553.4399999999998
lesson it's so complicated i haven't

1551.679 --> 1555.1200000000001
kept track

1553.44 --> 1558.0800000000002
i haven't kept track in a long time

1555.12 --> 1558.08
what's going on there

1561.279 --> 1566.48
maybe

1563.12 --> 1568.559
my absence has just kind of detached me

1566.48 --> 1570.32
and it could turn out if i just go to

1568.559 --> 1572.48
one of those typical parties that it's

1570.32 --> 1576.0
just gonna be exactly the same as it all

1572.48 --> 1577.039
it was and just everybody's like

1576.0 --> 1579.039
five

1577.039 --> 1581.2
years older

1579.039 --> 1583.2
that's it

1581.2 --> 1585.919
i mean even back then there were just

1583.2 --> 1587.3600000000001
guys that have been doing that for like

1585.919 --> 1588.88
30 years

1587.36 --> 1591.039
and they're like yeah this is just where

1588.88 --> 1593.5200000000002
i like to go out and they're like 50 or

1591.039 --> 1595.36
something like and those are like

1593.52 --> 1597.679
awesome people

1595.36 --> 1599.52
those people were always the awesome

1597.679 --> 1601.8400000000001
ones the the older

1599.52 --> 1604.48
guys and women

1601.84 --> 1606.1589999999999
that weren't just like oh i'm so sexy

1604.48 --> 1609.039
i'm so special but they were just like

1606.159 --> 1611.7600000000002
there no like we're just friends like

1609.039 --> 1613.679
this is our form of going

1611.76 --> 1615.84
to the bar

1613.679 --> 1617.1200000000001
but much more awesome

1615.84 --> 1618.08
and

1617.12 --> 1620.0
yeah

1618.08 --> 1621.84
i did appreciate that had good

1620.0 --> 1624.24
conversations just with good solid

1621.84 --> 1625.6
spirit

1624.24 --> 1629.679
so

1625.6 --> 1629.6789999999999
there's also good energy in that scene

1630.4 --> 1635.1200000000001
from my experience but maybe that's

1632.48 --> 1637.279
because i brought it it brought it up in

1635.12 --> 1639.36
people i don't know you never really

1637.279 --> 1641.44
know

1639.36 --> 1644.32
because you don't get to see them when

1641.44 --> 1644.3200000000002
you're not with them

1648.159 --> 1652.48
but a pretty good sense even back then

1652.72 --> 1658.159
which it needs to be called out his

1655.039 --> 1658.1589999999999
claim of ether

1658.32 --> 1663.9189999999999
call him out i mean

1661.679 --> 1666.8400000000001
he has been called out lumpy guess in

1663.919 --> 1669.679
fact i mean nathan's

1666.84 --> 1672.24
rant it's right there

1669.679 --> 1674.3200000000002
it's even short shorts made of it like

1672.24 --> 1675.84
those looping videos

1674.32 --> 1678.559
right

1675.84 --> 1678.559
it's right there

1679.039 --> 1684.0
does he really need any more calling out

1682.35 --> 1685.84
[Music]

1684.0 --> 1688.32
i mean unless he's start gonna start

1685.84 --> 1689.6789999999999
making videos we're just literally super

1688.32 --> 1691.4399999999998
at homing us

1689.679 --> 1693.44
or nathan oakley or something but i

1691.44 --> 1695.6000000000001
don't see him doing that at all

1693.44 --> 1698.88
so i don't really get your point there

1695.6 --> 1698.8799999999999
lumpy gas in a vacuum

1706.6 --> 1713.279
specifically for singles what pj what

1710.559 --> 1715.84
the hell i don't even know what that is

1713.279 --> 1717.36
did you see parties specifically for

1715.84 --> 1720.0
singles what

1717.36 --> 1720.0
that sounds

1720.88 --> 1725.1200000000001
like

1722.32 --> 1726.24
a dating thing

1725.12 --> 1729.039
then

1726.24 --> 1729.039
specifically

1729.12 --> 1732.84
i've never done that

1741.44 --> 1745.1200000000001
like on the surface that sounds kind of

1743.6 --> 1746.9599999999998
gross

1745.12 --> 1749.52
because there will then

1746.96 --> 1751.679
obviously be like people that are liking

1749.52 --> 1753.84
you and you don't like them and you you

1751.679 --> 1755.6000000000001
know they don't even

1753.84 --> 1757.9189999999999
understand what you are

1755.6 --> 1761.12
and then they're going to be like oh

1757.919 --> 1761.1200000000001
that just seems gross

1764.24 --> 1768.3990000000001
if it's like specifically for singles

1770.88 --> 1775.2
but anyway maybe when you're older or

1773.279 --> 1778.0
something i don't know

1775.2 --> 1781.1200000000001
not everybody's as gloriously beautiful

1778.0 --> 1782.159
as i am

1781.12 --> 1784.1589999999999
i just

1782.159 --> 1786.159
look

1784.159 --> 1788.7990000000002
there's somebody out there that is like

1786.159 --> 1791.6000000000001
really gonna capture my heart and i will

1788.799 --> 1795.12
for some mystical reason be able to let

1791.6 --> 1800.08
that happen then i will get them

1795.12 --> 1800.08
i don't need any dating systems

1800.88 --> 1803.679
i never have

1802.24 --> 1806.679
ever

1803.679 --> 1806.679
ever

1808.24 --> 1811.84
right with me it's just about

1812.559 --> 1817.76
getting what you want like if you really

1815.279 --> 1820.559
want it it's going to happen right but

1817.76 --> 1823.6
you can't just be like oh my whining

1820.559 --> 1825.76
did i don't want to be single

1823.6 --> 1828.1589999999999
yeah that doesn't work for me it's like

1825.76 --> 1832.0
i got to see somebody and then basically

1828.159 --> 1832.0
fall in love with them on the surface

1832.799 --> 1838.32
and then it just makes me do what i can

1835.919 --> 1840.3990000000001
do then and and be myself it's the only

1838.32 --> 1843.039
way it's ever succeeded

1840.399 --> 1845.84
it's like a very specific bird dance or

1843.039 --> 1848.08
something and i have no grip on it i

1845.84 --> 1850.9599999999998
just know when it's successful and when

1848.08 --> 1852.6399999999999
it isn't

1850.96 --> 1858.0
what if i'm like i don't want to be

1852.64 --> 1858.0
alone yeah then it just never ever works

1858.399 --> 1861.6
i only ever get relationships when i'm

1860.399 --> 1864.08
like

1861.6 --> 1866.32
perfectly fine feeling single it's

1864.08 --> 1868.799
almost like a revenge sometimes i think

1866.32 --> 1872.24
of the universe it's like oh oh oh arwin

1868.799 --> 1874.0
thinks it's okay to be single right

1872.24 --> 1876.559
here you go

1874.0 --> 1878.96
oh really now that i actually didn't

1876.559 --> 1881.039
really want it yeah of course

1878.96 --> 1884.279
that's how that works but yeah it is how

1881.039 --> 1884.279
that works

1892.559 --> 1896.08
better to be single than be with the

1894.48 --> 1897.279
wrong person yeah

1896.08 --> 1898.72
but

1897.279 --> 1901.12
yeah

1898.72 --> 1902.64
but i mean you don't look there's people

1901.12 --> 1905.36
out there that also just have a

1902.64 --> 1905.3600000000001
relationship

1905.679 --> 1909.3600000000001
they more have like a partnership but

1907.6 --> 1910.7199999999998
they're not really in love or something

1909.36 --> 1912.9599999999998
right

1910.72 --> 1916.72
they're just like yeah but

1912.96 --> 1916.72
they're my homie or something

1917.12 --> 1922.2399999999998
male female it works too

1919.76 --> 1924.799
i mean it feels weird it's not really a

1922.24 --> 1927.279
relationship but if it works for them

1924.799 --> 1929.84
i mean that is almost like a soft

1927.279 --> 1930.88
marriage contract

1929.84 --> 1933.4399999999998
right

1930.88 --> 1936.0800000000002
i mean originally marriage

1933.44 --> 1937.6000000000001
wasn't about love it really it wasn't it

1936.08 --> 1940.559
never was

1937.6 --> 1942.559
that's been romanticized to become that

1940.559 --> 1943.91
thanks to disney

1946.399 --> 1950.7199999999998
i can't really blame all them it's it's

1948.799 --> 1953.2
just the notion that seeped in i think

1950.72 --> 1954.159
is probably renaissance based

1953.2 --> 1956.72
but

1954.159 --> 1960.72
it's mostly an agreement it's like a

1956.72 --> 1964.32
feel male female agreement like we're

1960.72 --> 1967.44
partnering like we're gonna be a team

1964.32 --> 1967.4399999999998
that's a real marriage

hello the goods have i ever heard music

that is hilarious to say terry 306 but i

2011.44 --> 2016.1200000000001
don't think i can help you with that

2037.039 --> 2039.36
what

2041.279 --> 2047.279
socket wrenches

2044.0 --> 2048.8
so it's like an industrial type sound

2047.279 --> 2052.96
thing then

2048.8 --> 2056.2400000000002
gangnam style but like on an industrial

2052.96 --> 2058.2400000000002
machinery type techno style

2056.24 --> 2060.24
what

2058.24 --> 2062.4799999999996
that sounds

2060.24 --> 2066.04
really really silly

2062.48 --> 2066.04
thank you for that

2081.52 --> 2083.7599999999998
right

2084.0 --> 2088.879
by the way is my my voice not getting

2087.359 --> 2090.72
tourney all to sleep i think it's

2088.879 --> 2093.1189999999997
because watching

2090.72 --> 2095.04
a mind unveiled video it's like i've

2093.119 --> 2097.2000000000003
been watching that for an hour and that

2095.04 --> 2102.04
guy is so freaking monotone it's kind of

2097.2 --> 2102.04
rubbing off on me by accident i think

2107.44 --> 2111.56
also it's really hot

2165.28 --> 2169.44
the agreements

2166.96 --> 2171.52
the other men give you

2169.44 --> 2174.64
right

2171.52 --> 2175.839
no love and yeah a lot of the times also

2174.64 --> 2177.92
no baby

2175.839 --> 2180.7999999999997
pj cnet right

2177.92 --> 2182.7200000000003
hear me out on this fully right so if

2180.8 --> 2184.5600000000004
you had the sugar daddy agreement with

2182.72 --> 2187.04
an older man

2184.56 --> 2189.68
give them a little luxury and they'd

2187.04 --> 2190.8
actually get a baby

2189.68 --> 2194.24
yeah

2190.8 --> 2196.1600000000003
that would be a perfectly honorable

2194.24 --> 2198.8799999999997
situation

2196.16 --> 2201.04
it would it would technically like

2198.88 --> 2204.88
fulfill

2201.04 --> 2208.64
pretty strong ancient bonded agreements

2204.88 --> 2211.2000000000003
on how to do that that's like good

2208.64 --> 2213.04
that's literally because then it's like

2211.2 --> 2215.04
a wife it doesn't really matter if

2213.04 --> 2217.68
they're younger and doesn't even matter

2215.04 --> 2220.64
if they love them it's like a

2217.68 --> 2223.2
marriage agreement pretty much

2220.64 --> 2224.3199999999997
if you have a kid but if they don't have

2223.2 --> 2228.48
a kid

2224.32 --> 2231.76
and so just for sexy time sexy time

2228.48 --> 2234.0
yeah then then it's [ __ ] wrong

2231.76 --> 2235.0400000000004
and it starts to feel wrong because it's

2234.0 --> 2238.88
not about

2235.04 --> 2241.68
my opinion is based on how you should do

2238.88 --> 2243.839
this no this is about energies

2241.68 --> 2243.839
yeah

2244.0 --> 2248.32
if you have an older man

2246.16 --> 2250.3199999999997
gets a young hot woman and they

2248.32 --> 2252.32
basically have a

2250.32 --> 2254.56
marriage agreement and she's gonna get

2252.32 --> 2256.7200000000003
his child because like he never got to

2254.56 --> 2258.56
it or

2256.72 --> 2260.56
whatever

2258.56 --> 2262.7999999999997
i feel almost like yeah that's sort of

2260.56 --> 2264.7999999999997
what i hope to get maybe one day but

2262.8 --> 2267.119
maybe i wouldn't even have to

2264.8 --> 2268.96
maybe i'll be quicker than that

2267.119 --> 2271.119
but

2268.96 --> 2272.48
right it is called prostitution that's

2271.119 --> 2275.04
yeah

2272.48 --> 2276.72
if you if you just

2275.04 --> 2278.8
spoil a woman

2276.72 --> 2280.64
have them hang around have sex and no

2278.8 --> 2283.6400000000003
kids yeah then it's it's kind of

2280.64 --> 2283.64
prostitution

2288.16 --> 2293.44
the sexy time wouldn't last long well

2290.4 --> 2294.8
that all depends on if he demands that

2293.44 --> 2296.839
right

2294.8 --> 2299.599
if he's like a gross

2296.839 --> 2301.04
squirter and he just wants that all the

2299.599 --> 2303.52
time yeah

2301.04 --> 2305.92
then it's going to be sexy time

2303.52 --> 2309.119
or no money

2305.92 --> 2313.16
like a prostitute that's the point

2309.119 --> 2313.1600000000003
that was also my point

2315.52 --> 2318.52
anyway

2322.89 --> 2326.2599999999998
[Music]

2327.599 --> 2330.56
hey hello guys

2331.04 --> 2336.599
and yeah also by the way hello george

2332.8 --> 2336.599
sanford good to see you

2363.119 --> 2367.04
right but i i just wanted to emphasize

2365.2 --> 2369.4399999999996
that there is an energy thing about it

2367.04 --> 2371.599
too right

2369.44 --> 2374.079
it feels different i mean you could

2371.599 --> 2376.2400000000002
literally have two old men

2374.079 --> 2377.92
there would be friends right

2376.24 --> 2380.0
business partners

2377.92 --> 2382.32
both of them would have like

2380.0 --> 2384.079
ladies that were

2382.32 --> 2386.88
they're like both 60 and they have both

2384.079 --> 2389.8390000000004
ladies that are like 25 and it's like

2386.88 --> 2392.6400000000003
yeah they're doing it for the money and

2389.839 --> 2395.68
like they find their men

2392.64 --> 2397.5989999999997
bearable right that's important

2395.68 --> 2399.1189999999997
because if it's just for the money and

2397.599 --> 2401.119
you really hate that it's never going to

2399.119 --> 2403.28
work that's just it might be a one-night

2401.119 --> 2405.28
stand for some cash or something

2403.28 --> 2406.88
but

2405.28 --> 2409.44
yeah

2406.88 --> 2411.92
like the way they're gonna have their

2409.44 --> 2413.76
relationship develop and the energies

2411.92 --> 2415.6800000000003
that come off them and reflect upon

2413.76 --> 2419.5200000000004
other people that they deal with gonna

2415.68 --> 2421.9199999999996
depend on how they're gonna set up that

2419.52 --> 2424.4
relationship now if one

2421.92 --> 2426.2400000000002
those friends

2424.4 --> 2428.7200000000003
just want sex

2426.24 --> 2430.319
and will give her anything right

2428.72 --> 2431.9199999999996
and the other one

2430.319 --> 2433.599
is like yeah

2431.92 --> 2435.52
i just want a really good wife and i

2433.599 --> 2436.88
want a kid and i never got to it because

2435.52 --> 2440.16
of business

2436.88 --> 2442.96
but now is the time to do that and

2440.16 --> 2445.44
before i get too old

2442.96 --> 2447.92
well i guarantee you

2445.44 --> 2452.64
the guy that just wants to squirt is

2447.92 --> 2455.2000000000003
gonna they're gonna have like this

2452.64 --> 2458.48
they're gonna like she's gonna be

2455.2 --> 2460.96
nasty she's gonna got in her in his way

2458.48 --> 2462.72
that's gonna happen at some point

2460.96 --> 2465.76
well the other one is like they're gonna

2462.72 --> 2465.7599999999998
start a family and

2465.839 --> 2471.119
they're probably like that man that

2468.0 --> 2472.88
actually got the kid with his young wife

2471.119 --> 2476.2400000000002
is probably gonna even be more

2472.88 --> 2476.2400000000002
successful in business

2476.96 --> 2481.52
because the energy is better

2479.599 --> 2483.119
it's better

2481.52 --> 2485.839
it's more blessed

2483.119 --> 2486.7200000000003
well the other one is basically in just

2485.839 --> 2489.44
like

2486.72 --> 2491.7599999999998
like she's a neck and she he's escaping

2489.44 --> 2493.359
from her and like trying to avoid phone

2491.76 --> 2496.1600000000003
calls like that's gonna be the

2493.359 --> 2496.16
difference guys

2497.599 --> 2502.88
i know that a lot of men out there have

2500.56 --> 2505.119
experienced

2502.88 --> 2506.56
the latter and they know what that is

2505.119 --> 2507.839
you they know what that mean they know

2506.56 --> 2510.0789999999997
the energy

2507.839 --> 2513.44
it's like this this raw energy it's

2510.079 --> 2515.28
always wrong it always gets in your way

2513.44 --> 2516.48
that's

2515.28 --> 2519.28
that's sin

2516.48 --> 2521.599
crawling up on you

2519.28 --> 2523.28
right you might not think what you're

2521.599 --> 2525.839
doing is sin

2523.28 --> 2528.1600000000003
but it effectively is because it's a

2525.839 --> 2531.52
mechanism it's something that happens

2528.16 --> 2533.7599999999998
within the design with our spirits

2531.52 --> 2536.72
it's god's warning

2533.76 --> 2538.8
right

2536.72 --> 2540.8799999999997
it doesn't work it doesn't connect

2538.8 --> 2543.44
things are not being used what they're

2540.88 --> 2544.88
designed for

2543.44 --> 2547.28
energy wise

2544.88 --> 2550.599
whether you know that is a thing or not

2547.28 --> 2550.599
doesn't matter

2556.72 --> 2560.64
it's simp energy on both sides

2561.28 --> 2567.28
no it's not gas

2563.599 --> 2567.28
because on one side

2567.68 --> 2572.3999999999996
the man that actually

2569.76 --> 2574.88
wanted a kid with his young wife

2572.4 --> 2577.6800000000003
they're not gonna have that simp energy

2574.88 --> 2580.56
like she's gonna actually take care of

2577.68 --> 2582.64
her son and be kind of happy that she's

2580.56 --> 2583.92
being provided for so well because what

2582.64 --> 2586.24
as a wife

2583.92 --> 2588.48
as a mother would you like more than

2586.24 --> 2589.2799999999997
that

2588.48 --> 2591.839
right

2589.28 --> 2594.96
worse that could happen is that like oh

2591.839 --> 2596.88
my man suddenly dies of old age but she

2594.96 --> 2598.8
probably still then inherited and etc

2596.88 --> 2602.6400000000003
it's a good place to be

2598.8 --> 2605.04
for her she's not gonna nag him

2602.64 --> 2606.8799999999997
now the other one

2605.04 --> 2608.64
they don't have a new life mission they

2606.88 --> 2611.92
don't have a kid

2608.64 --> 2614.0789999999997
and they're gonna get bored

2611.92 --> 2615.6800000000003
and it's gonna start turning into a

2614.079 --> 2618.8
nagging demon

2615.68 --> 2618.7999999999997
that's the big difference

2619.68 --> 2621.839
right

2622.4 --> 2625.359
hello susie s

2629.359 --> 2634.25
ew

2630.24 --> 2637.04
gideon sick that's so gross

2634.25 --> 2640.04
[Music]

2637.04 --> 2640.04
dude

2658.68 --> 2662.96
[Music]

2660.48 --> 2666.0
right anyway it's just

2662.96 --> 2667.52
just something to think about like

2666.0 --> 2669.599
what are you gonna do

2667.52 --> 2671.599
right

2669.599 --> 2673.44
i mean the age gap

2671.599 --> 2676.079
is

2673.44 --> 2678.48
it is telling it is something that like

2676.079 --> 2680.079
pushes a slider up that requires more

2678.48 --> 2683.76
intention

2680.079 --> 2686.319
because of the tension that it creates

2683.76 --> 2687.5200000000004
if you then proceed to do it the right

2686.319 --> 2689.68
way

2687.52 --> 2691.839
then suddenly the age difference really

2689.68 --> 2696.0
doesn't matter all that much i mean if

2691.839 --> 2698.24
it's like whoa that's your wife ooh

2696.0 --> 2699.44
right like oh that's so that's kind of

2698.24 --> 2701.1189999999997
gross

2699.44 --> 2704.16
but then it's like yeah but here's my

2701.119 --> 2707.359
kid like she's her mother this is my kid

2704.16 --> 2709.52
and then your that is gonna fade away

2707.359 --> 2710.88
it is gonna fade away because they're

2709.52 --> 2714.16
having a kid

2710.88 --> 2714.1600000000003
it's okay now

2714.72 --> 2720.3999999999996
right

2716.64 --> 2720.4
that's what what would happen

2721.52 --> 2724.91
like whether they

2723.119 --> 2726.4
it's it's an intuitive thing

2724.91 --> 2728.0789999999997
[Music]

2726.4 --> 2729.599
are you getting me are you getting me

2728.079 --> 2733.5600000000004
here guys

2729.599 --> 2733.56
you understand what i mean

2755.28 --> 2759.1600000000003
right

2756.16 --> 2759.16
good

2762.079 --> 2766.5600000000004
right as long as the relationship is

2764.16 --> 2771.2
fruitful and honorable

2766.56 --> 2771.2
in agreement with nate the natural way

2771.52 --> 2776.16
arguably designated by god and revealed

2775.04 --> 2777.7599999999998
by man

2776.16 --> 2780.3999999999996
also

2777.76 --> 2782.3190000000004
then eight yeah the age gap just doesn't

2780.4 --> 2785.119
matter that much if you just do it right

2782.319 --> 2787.04
and you just get a kid it it really

2785.119 --> 2789.52
like it's not even about political

2787.04 --> 2792.24
decision where do you stand no this is

2789.52 --> 2793.92
never too no this is about an intuitive

2792.24 --> 2795.7599999999998
reaction

2793.92 --> 2798.319
what's the difference oh you have a

2795.76 --> 2800.8390000000004
super young wife that gross oh you have

2798.319 --> 2803.359
a kid with her oh

2800.839 --> 2805.119
okay sadly it's not super good now

2803.359 --> 2807.92
suddenly you're not just in your mind

2805.119 --> 2809.2000000000003
seeing like her prostituting herself on

2807.92 --> 2812.56
him right

2809.2 --> 2812.56
because they have a kid

2814.0 --> 2817.839
it's that basic

2824.56 --> 2829.68
and also me his d is what okay territ

2829.76 --> 2835.88
yes

2830.72 --> 2835.8799999999997
that's the most important part of course

2838.53 --> 2841.6290000000004
[Music]

2853.92 --> 2860.0
right i title my show this

2857.359 --> 2861.68
but it probably wouldn't fit in 200

2860.0 --> 2865.52
characters and it's a bit of a weird

2861.68 --> 2868.96
title basically to call your show that

2865.52 --> 2871.52
i i probably get marked as 80 plus 18

2868.96 --> 2873.2
plus subtleties

2871.52 --> 2875.359
yeah

2873.2 --> 2876.72
but uh

2875.359 --> 2878.24
there's something that i've been

2876.72 --> 2881.52
thinking about i mean i'm getting a

2878.24 --> 2884.839
little older and i still want kids

2881.52 --> 2888.8
i'm not really there yet

2884.839 --> 2891.839
but like i refuse to scrap it out of my

2888.8 --> 2894.48
playbook i'm never gonna like

2891.839 --> 2897.359
snuff that longing that i've had for

2894.48 --> 2900.8
like 20 years

2897.359 --> 2902.88
at first i was like mortified not for

2900.8 --> 2906.079
getting the responsibility but more to

2902.88 --> 2907.92
fight for virtual parties

2906.079 --> 2910.559
that i thought were literally gonna just

2907.92 --> 2913.44
like steal my children or something if i

2910.559 --> 2915.8390000000004
ever got them because i was not capable

2913.44 --> 2917.68
of even realizing that they were there

2915.839 --> 2919.119
yet but i felt something was really

2917.68 --> 2921.5989999999997
wrong and

2919.119 --> 2924.2400000000002
really met the yet jesuit guy who showed

2921.599 --> 2928.2400000000002
really dark [ __ ]

2924.24 --> 2930.7999999999997
and i became lit i was frightened

2928.24 --> 2933.04
to go for that i was

2930.8 --> 2934.88
and that's all my own fault

2933.04 --> 2937.599
it's my own weakness

2934.88 --> 2939.2000000000003
but i never really thought like oh oh

2937.599 --> 2942.6800000000003
it's never going to be worth it no i

2939.2 --> 2942.68
never gave up

2943.119 --> 2946.4
still want to see

2945.44 --> 2948.64
like

2946.4 --> 2950.0
what my kid hopefully a son but even a

2948.64 --> 2952.7999999999997
daughter

2950.0 --> 2955.599
i really hope also a son of my firstborn

2952.8 --> 2958.319
would be a son

2955.599 --> 2960.4
to see them go

2958.319 --> 2963.119
through the same spiritual mental

2960.4 --> 2966.1600000000003
transformations as i did as a kid and

2963.119 --> 2968.48
now me knowing so much more than even my

2966.16 --> 2970.96
parents did back then

2968.48 --> 2973.359
as they guided me

2970.96 --> 2976.079
i it's like that's a unique experience

2973.359 --> 2979.52
experience that i cannot let go of

2976.079 --> 2981.8390000000004
i cannot let that go i have to

2979.52 --> 2984.72
i have to have that

2981.839 --> 2987.04
before i go

2984.72 --> 2989.1189999999997
it would always be weighing on me if i

2987.04 --> 2992.079
never had that

2989.119 --> 2992.079
even on to death

2996.839 --> 3003.599
anyway let's not make this too

3000.88 --> 3003.599
depressing

3009.28 --> 3015.2000000000003
all right but i'm still young and i'm

3011.599 --> 3016.4
still vital and i got my indonesian

3015.2 --> 3019.2
genetics

3016.4 --> 3022.8
which i got the young genetics i got him

3019.2 --> 3025.839
i got that gene got it just like my dad

3022.8 --> 3028.1600000000003
just like my grandfather from his his

3025.839 --> 3031.04
dad

3028.16 --> 3031.04
i got that gene

3031.599 --> 3035.44
and there's others that i've seen that

3033.44 --> 3037.44
were like

3035.44 --> 3040.319
like when i was still with my ex

3037.44 --> 3042.96
like there was a friend guy was sort of

3040.319 --> 3044.72
into the same alternative medical field

3042.96 --> 3047.04
doing things with that

3044.72 --> 3048.7999999999997
that kind of came by every now and then

3047.04 --> 3050.079
pretty cool guy

3048.8 --> 3053.48
and

3050.079 --> 3053.48
his dad

3054.319 --> 3058.079
was it

3056.0 --> 3060.88
was

3058.079 --> 3063.76
like really old

3060.88 --> 3066.1600000000003
i thought it was like 70 or something

3063.76 --> 3067.44
when he conceived him

3066.16 --> 3070.64
really

3067.44 --> 3075.44
and he was perfectly fine yeah of course

3070.64 --> 3075.44
the the wife was actually 25.

3076.319 --> 3081.44
okay

3077.44 --> 3082.7200000000003
i mean my 60 and 24 yeah no

3081.44 --> 3084.2400000000002
how about

3082.72 --> 3086.64
70

3084.24 --> 3088.319
and 25

3086.64 --> 3091.04
yeah and the kid

3088.319 --> 3092.319
came out of that was really healthy and

3091.04 --> 3095.44
smart

3092.319 --> 3095.44
a lot of good spirit

3095.52 --> 3097.839
so

3105.04 --> 3109.2799999999997
we're kind of scared to bring a kid into

3106.96 --> 3111.2
this world the way it is now i disagree

3109.28 --> 3112.7200000000003
i got so much

3111.2 --> 3115.04
to offer

3112.72 --> 3117.359
my kid as a defense

3115.04 --> 3119.44
you underestimate how incredibly

3117.359 --> 3121.44
freaking brilliant children are they're

3119.44 --> 3123.28
usually smarter

3121.44 --> 3124.8
than their own parents

3123.28 --> 3128.3190000000004
when they're still young they just don't

3124.8 --> 3128.319
have a lot to reflect upon

3128.48 --> 3134.559
that's how i see that's how i was i

3131.359 --> 3136.4
literally remembered how that was and i

3134.559 --> 3138.88
recognized it in other kids that are

3136.4 --> 3143.2000000000003
really bright how they just they're

3138.88 --> 3146.48
freaking bored and they're super smart

3143.2 --> 3146.48
and they start acting

3147.599 --> 3152.7200000000003
kind of lazy

3149.92 --> 3154.88
to adapt to their natural boredom

3152.72 --> 3157.7599999999998
because the parents just aren't giving

3154.88 --> 3157.76
them what they need

3159.2 --> 3164.48
well

3160.559 --> 3166.3190000000004
i could like really give them some heavy

3164.48 --> 3169.52
stuff

3166.319 --> 3170.48
at a very young age in the right way

3169.52 --> 3172.079
and

3170.48 --> 3174.16
like

3172.079 --> 3175.04
guidance

3174.16 --> 3178.16
so

3175.04 --> 3181.44
i am not afraid to have a kid i just i'm

3178.16 --> 3184.7999999999997
more afraid of like the mother

3181.44 --> 3187.359
can they freaking handle reality right

3184.8 --> 3190.1600000000003
now that's more of a worry my kid

3187.359 --> 3191.7599999999998
they're gonna handle reality because i'm

3190.16 --> 3193.1189999999997
their dad

3191.76 --> 3195.8390000000004
they will

3193.119 --> 3198.6400000000003
i will sit through them even when i was

3195.839 --> 3200.7999999999997
panicking my parents feel i know exactly

3198.64 --> 3204.0
i know how deep that goes

3200.8 --> 3206.48
i know what to do i know what the show i

3204.0 --> 3208.4
know what i needed to see back then i

3206.48 --> 3210.96
didn't

3208.4 --> 3213.92
i know it all i know how that works that

3210.96 --> 3213.92
part i remember

3214.48 --> 3217.359
you know what to do

3217.839 --> 3222.88
to get to forge that bond

3220.72 --> 3226.0
for real

3222.88 --> 3226.0
and not half-assed

3234.24 --> 3239.2
so yeah i understand susie that you feel

3237.28 --> 3241.44
like that

3239.2 --> 3244.0789999999997
i yeah i don't know what it is like to

3241.44 --> 3244.079
be a woman

3244.88 --> 3249.28
right maybe

3246.4 --> 3252.559
to you it's even worse this world

3249.28 --> 3255.599
because of the way you perceive it

3252.559 --> 3257.52
through the way you're built spiritually

3255.599 --> 3259.839
but

3257.52 --> 3263.119
i know it's messed up out there

3259.839 --> 3265.44
but if you just really

3263.119 --> 3267.6800000000003
focus on

3265.44 --> 3269.44
being a father

3267.68 --> 3271.359
then

3269.44 --> 3273.68
they shouldn't just yeah you should be

3271.359 --> 3277.64
able to give them exactly what they need

3273.68 --> 3277.64
to to master

3278.48 --> 3284.16
to become masters at dealing with how

3280.799 --> 3284.16
messed up this world is

3284.24 --> 3290.16
at a very young age

3286.48 --> 3291.92
just the continuing of the guidance

3290.16 --> 3294.24
even when things get tight even when

3291.92 --> 3296.0
like really dark [ __ ] starts to move in

3294.24 --> 3299.359
and try to like

3296.0 --> 3304.119
break you apart because that happens too

3299.359 --> 3304.119
that happened with our family too

3310.16 --> 3312.8799999999997
arguably

3313.359 --> 3318.16
as a kid

3315.359 --> 3320.4
i think sometimes that by my openness

3318.16 --> 3322.24
and enthusiasm in showing my

3320.4 --> 3323.359
intelligence and wisdom at that young

3322.24 --> 3325.68
age

3323.359 --> 3328.4
i probably frighten a whole bunch of

3325.68 --> 3330.72
peoples of a very specific type of

3328.4 --> 3333.44
religion

3330.72 --> 3334.799
that were frightened of me and literally

3333.44 --> 3337.04
decided to

3334.799 --> 3340.96
wreck

3337.04 --> 3343.839
the cohesion within my family

3340.96 --> 3345.04
to burden us so that it would fail and

3343.839 --> 3348.319
break apart

3345.04 --> 3350.72
to seduce individuals in my family to

3348.319 --> 3354.64
start pushing that

3350.72 --> 3356.319
because i actually was like i am free

3354.64 --> 3358.64
i'm not afraid

3356.319 --> 3360.16
i'm really freaking smart i'm gonna fix

3358.64 --> 3362.5589999999997
all this

3360.16 --> 3365.52
evil doesn't stand a chance but i didn't

3362.559 --> 3367.92
know yet exactly what evil was

3365.52 --> 3369.7599999999998
i felt it at a distance but i had not

3367.92 --> 3371.119
actually

3369.76 --> 3372.7200000000003
seen it

3371.119 --> 3375.6800000000003
to a way that it would be fully

3372.72 --> 3377.5989999999997
conscious to me i just knew it

3375.68 --> 3380.72
it just

3377.599 --> 3383.28
but i didn't know it consciously

3380.72 --> 3384.8799999999997
it's just something that i understood

3383.28 --> 3386.6400000000003
subconsciously

3384.88 --> 3389.04
yeah

3386.64 --> 3391.44
oh my god going to effort to feel that

3389.04 --> 3395.04
how whatever i need

3391.44 --> 3395.04
whatever i need to do

3396.079 --> 3401.52
yeah

3397.28 --> 3401.52
and i mean whatever i need to do

3402.559 --> 3408.1600000000003
and if people are gonna block me

3405.52 --> 3411.28
then i will like if people are literally

3408.16 --> 3413.04
gonna sabotage me actively in trying to

3411.28 --> 3416.92
take care of my kid then i'll probably

3413.04 --> 3416.92
turn into a high women

3423.92 --> 3428.0
right if people are going to let that

3425.839 --> 3433.119
happen to that extent

3428.0 --> 3437.28
then i will start breaking down castles

3433.119 --> 3441.04
until those forces that are pushing that

3437.28 --> 3441.0400000000004
basically crumble before me

3442.799 --> 3448.799
in other words if you [ __ ] with me while

3445.28 --> 3452.079
i have a kid and try to ruin it for me i

3448.799 --> 3452.079
will destroy you

3452.96 --> 3456.4
and i mean destroy

3459.28 --> 3462.88
feed a child in the west let's go yeah

3461.2 --> 3465.52
think again

3462.88 --> 3467.839
yeah i i don't need a

3465.52 --> 3470.64
free soylent green

3467.839 --> 3474.68
drinks from bill gates for my baby yeah

3470.64 --> 3474.68
that's not what i'm gonna need

3492.72 --> 3497.52
all right

3493.76 --> 3500.079
but yeah sure i'll definitely get a job

3497.52 --> 3502.24
and i'll definitely try to make our own

3500.079 --> 3504.559
food i mean it shouldn't be that

3502.24 --> 3506.64
incredibly tough to do

3504.559 --> 3510.079
my parents did it

3506.64 --> 3510.0789999999997
i mean we had a great garden

3512.24 --> 3518.0789999999997
i did actually get to work in some of it

3514.799 --> 3520.799
i was just really freaking distracted by

3518.079 --> 3523.04
computers all the time

3520.799 --> 3527.2
it was a strong competitor and the

3523.04 --> 3527.2
computers kind of won out at some point

3527.68 --> 3533.9199999999996
and that could be correlating with

3531.599 --> 3537.44
that my parents were basically just like

3533.92 --> 3542.2400000000002
really growing apart spiritually

3537.44 --> 3544.64
and so as they did that then their

3542.24 --> 3546.64
routine that they would give me would

3544.64 --> 3548.72
also fracture they simply didn't have

3546.64 --> 3550.5589999999997
time for me anymore

3548.72 --> 3553.9599999999996
because they were too preoccupied with

3550.559 --> 3553.96
their own arguments

3571.52 --> 3577.119
yeah so yeah i have no worries

3575.28 --> 3581.0400000000004
i'm going to feed my child yeah it's

3577.119 --> 3583.839
absolutely no problem you see you cannot

3581.04 --> 3586.799
start whispering like a [ __ ] snakey

3583.839 --> 3589.2799999999997
fat piece of [ __ ] psychopath

3586.799 --> 3590.64
doesn't work when you do that

3589.28 --> 3594.0
to try to

3590.64 --> 3596.96
talk the idea out of me oh yes no it

3594.0 --> 3601.359

and uh

3620.48 --> 3624.72
whatever it takes

3622.559 --> 3628.4
and if i need to slaughter a thousand

3624.72 --> 3630.72
people to do it whatever it takes no

3628.4 --> 3632.319
matter the hellish level of action

3630.72 --> 3635.04
required

3632.319 --> 3638.16
and i mean hellish whatever it takes it

3635.04 --> 3640.72
won't drive toward hellish

3638.16 --> 3644.16
but i will absolutely go there in an

3640.72 --> 3646.72
instant without any doubt

3644.16 --> 3646.72
to do it

3647.44 --> 3650.4

3710.839 --> 3716.16
know the woman

3714.0 --> 3718.65

bimbos is going to happen

3734.88 --> 3738.44

3756.16 --> 3759.16
what

3772.559 --> 3776.559
right

3773.68 --> 3779.0389999999998
that's right susie s and i am extremely

3776.559 --> 3781.2000000000003
protective

3779.039 --> 3782.599
and i am also in the face of my kid i

3781.2 --> 3787.359
will be

3782.599 --> 3790.4
legendarily stable and i mean legendary

3787.359 --> 3793.52
like a level of stability that literally

3790.4 --> 3795.6800000000003
no other person in the world would ever

3793.52 --> 3796.96
deserve to even see

3795.68 --> 3799.5989999999997
yeah

3796.96 --> 3803.599
that's how freaking stable and

3799.599 --> 3803.599
protective as a paradigm would be

3803.76 --> 3807.559
i mean fanatical

3811.15 --> 3816.579
[Music]

3818.64 --> 3823.52
it wouldn't even be that hard because

3820.559 --> 3826.6400000000003
i'd simply have to tap in the pure free

3823.52 --> 3829.44
energies of that that are already there

3826.64 --> 3830.96
in my kit because that's exactly what

3829.44 --> 3834.559
they have

3830.96 --> 3837.359
and what i need to do that it's

3834.559 --> 3839.8390000000004
pure spiritual chemistry i can do that i

3837.359 --> 3843.68
will do that i will be a completely

3839.839 --> 3843.68
different person from that moment on

3846.96 --> 3853.7200000000003
like palpably because that's what

3849.92 --> 3853.7200000000003
fatherhood would do

3867.44 --> 3872.2400000000002
and arrested for feeding globetrotters

3869.68 --> 3872.24
bitcoin

3872.48 --> 3876.48
come on guys can't you make up better

3874.559 --> 3878.96
jokes in this

3876.48 --> 3881.839
really just

3878.96 --> 3881.839
i mean come on

3886.0 --> 3892.079
do you have a university degree

3888.48 --> 3895.079
professor philbo he is in university

3892.079 --> 3895.079

3897.76 --> 3902.3590000000004
old boomer like you professor field

3928.0 --> 3931.359
yeah

3928.799 --> 3934.16
it does gideon's sick i know it does

3931.359 --> 3937.119
and i know with people like me like how

3934.16 --> 3939.7599999999998
i was

3937.119 --> 3942.319
if becoming a parent doesn't change your

3939.76 --> 3944.4
programming for the better

3942.319 --> 3946.24
right you can make you can get an

3944.4 --> 3948.2400000000002
incredible blessing out of becoming a

3946.24 --> 3951.0389999999998
parent because of

3948.24 --> 3953.0389999999998
taking it serious if you don't then a

3951.039 --> 3956.0
hell will be unleashed on you that will

3953.039 --> 3957.44
never go away

3956.0 --> 3959.839
right

3957.44 --> 3961.52
if you truly fail your kid and that's

3959.839 --> 3962.799
not because they were teenager and

3961.52 --> 3965.68
they're moody and they don't agree

3962.799 --> 3968.4
that's not about that at all

3965.68 --> 3970.3999999999996
if you truly like disconnect and fail if

3968.4 --> 3974.559
you don't

3970.4 --> 3976.88
uphold the highest level possible

3974.559 --> 3978.6400000000003
not monomanically

3976.88 --> 3982.96
don't not

3978.64 --> 3985.52
in cost of your flexibility

3982.96 --> 3987.68
if you don't do that then you literally

3985.52 --> 3989.68
disconnect and then a hell

3987.68 --> 3991.68
through your kit

3989.68 --> 3994.72
start following you around and it will

3991.68 --> 3997.7599999999998
never go away until you die

3994.72 --> 3997.7599999999998
seen it in others

3998.64 --> 4002.4
children's are a blessing but if you

4000.319 --> 4007.839
don't take that blessing as serious as

4002.4 --> 4007.839
it requires then it can turn into a hell

4013.039 --> 4017.599
yeah i mean if you do that you could

4015.28 --> 4020.599
turn into that piece of [ __ ] there in

4017.599 --> 4020.599
chat

4021.119 --> 4026.48
become like that that's what happened

4023.28 --> 4028.6400000000003
when you actually disconnect

4026.48 --> 4030.799
to your kid

4028.64 --> 4032.64
because you're just [ __ ] weak or too

4030.799 --> 4034.319
deluded to even understand what you're

4032.64 --> 4035.52
doing that you are doing that

4034.319 --> 4037.52
spiritually

4035.52 --> 4039.359
you have other priorities that are all

4037.52 --> 4041.52
virtual and complete nonsense

4039.359 --> 4043.52
contemporary [ __ ]

4041.52 --> 4045.92
make you seem more interesting to your

4043.52 --> 4045.92
peers

4048.799 --> 4053.7599999999998
your kid will become like that piece of

4050.96 --> 4055.52
[ __ ] that constantly pops up in chat

4053.76 --> 4058.079
with his sock accounts

4055.52 --> 4061.52
to just parasite on other people and try

4058.079 --> 4063.8390000000004
to demolish and discourage them because

4061.52 --> 4065.52
that's what their daddy did in their

4063.839 --> 4069.2
mind to them

4065.52 --> 4071.599
by disconnecting it's pure vengeance

4069.2 --> 4073.359
their parents failed him and now he's a

4071.599 --> 4077.52
demon

4073.359 --> 4080.319
now he does that just a demon lost

4077.52 --> 4083.68
destroyer

4080.319 --> 4083.68
ruler of garbage

4087.44 --> 4092.319
the hell that will never go away until

4089.92 --> 4092.319
you die

4093.92 --> 4096.799
and even then

4095.359 --> 4099.679
their hell

4096.799 --> 4102.0
that was caused by by their daddy yeah

4099.679 --> 4103.6
daddy even if you go

4102.0 --> 4105.92
that hell

4103.6 --> 4108.719
will still roam the earth and it will

4105.92 --> 4110.56
make other people lives their lives hell

4108.719 --> 4113.199

4110.56 --> 4114.96

4384.56 --> 4388.159000000001
well that's just lame then

4390.0 --> 4394.8
but why the hell was it even like so

4392.0 --> 4399.56
popular i don't get it like why did

4394.8 --> 4399.56
people like act like that

4401.92 --> 4405.6
nothing like bad taste to unite the

4403.6 --> 4410.159000000001
masses i guess

4405.6 --> 4410.159000000001
it's a kids movie no it's not

4410.32 --> 4416.48
no freaking way jarvis

4413.52 --> 4418.96
i mean the the entire thing is riddled

4416.48 --> 4421.839999999999
riddled with overt

4418.96 --> 4426.36
occult sex humor it's not a freaking

4421.84 --> 4426.360000000001
kids movie that's absurd

4427.6 --> 4432.320000000001
i mean

4428.88 --> 4434.88
it's a movie for adults with kid minds

4432.32 --> 4434.88
perhaps

4435.44 --> 4441.04
like any spoof movie

4438.32 --> 4442.799999999999
can't say that there are some funny

4441.04 --> 4446.239
spoof movies

4442.8 --> 4446.2390000000005
this thing was just lame

4446.4 --> 4450.96
like it was supposed to be funny and it

4448.56 --> 4453.1990000000005
just wasn't funny

4450.96 --> 4454.8
i mean it's a couple of those weird like

4453.199 --> 4457.28
oh

4454.8 --> 4460.159000000001
like goofy sort of slapstick thingies

4457.28 --> 4462.96
it's like okay that's just kind of cute

4460.159 --> 4465.199
right that's like the maximum kind of

4462.96 --> 4467.679
level of chuckle that i could get out

4465.199 --> 4469.839999999999
like everything else was just [ __ ]

4467.679 --> 4469.84
lame

4471.199 --> 4476.4
like and even the entire setup of just

4473.92 --> 4479.84
dr evil constantly like oh i'm going to

4476.4 --> 4482.879999999999
kill my general now oh i'm killing you

4479.84 --> 4484.8
it's just [ __ ] [ __ ] and like

4482.88 --> 4488.4800000000005
gross

4484.8 --> 4488.4800000000005
like that wasn't that was like

4489.12 --> 4496.32
like real psychotic

4492.0 --> 4498.32
psycho killer horror level of gross in

4496.32 --> 4501.28
plain sight played out as if it was

4498.32 --> 4503.28
funny it's like what the [ __ ] is this

4501.28 --> 4505.92
that's not funny that's absolutely

4503.28 --> 4508.88
ridiculous why does anybody still even

4505.92 --> 4510.64
come to visit this piece of [ __ ]

4508.88 --> 4513.6
like why

4510.64 --> 4515.92
why do people even go there

4513.6 --> 4518.4800000000005
i mean he doesn't even run the business

4515.92 --> 4519.1990000000005
anymore that other guy that he later

4518.48 --> 4521.919999999999
just

4519.199 --> 4524.719
launches into the fire again

4521.92 --> 4526.2390000000005
he did everything he owned it and he

4524.719 --> 4528.88
just killed him

4526.239 --> 4530.08
like he doesn't even have money in power

4528.88 --> 4533.28
really

4530.08 --> 4536.4
it's why it's so [ __ ] lame everything

4533.28 --> 4540.5599999999995
about it was so [ __ ] lame i hate it

4536.4 --> 4542.719
it's stupid [ __ ] pointless gross

4540.56 --> 4546.0
[ __ ] up

4542.719 --> 4547.76
not [ __ ] funny

4546.0 --> 4549.92
that's my verdict

4547.76 --> 4553.719
austin powers not

4549.92 --> 4553.719
[ __ ] funny

4556.32 --> 4559.28
the fat bastard was proof of sleeping

4558.4 --> 4562.08
warrior

4559.28 --> 4564.159
but that's in the second movie right

4562.08 --> 4565.12
i think that the second movie was better

4564.159 --> 4566.879999999999
probably

4565.12 --> 4570.32
this is gonna sound [ __ ] but i'm

4566.88 --> 4575.36
probably gonna watch the second one

4570.32 --> 4579.48
the first one is just lame

4575.36 --> 4579.48
it's just lame

4580.239 --> 4582.5599999999995
oh

4584.4 --> 4590.4
yeah but i like the fat bastard

4586.719 --> 4594.32
that was actually a funny character

4590.4 --> 4596.799999999999
like really memeable but i mean i guess

4594.32 --> 4599.04
that i didn't even remember the first

4596.8 --> 4600.56
movie i'll have to watch the second one

4599.04 --> 4603.679
because

4600.56 --> 4603.679
third one what

4604.0 --> 4607.0
jesus

4609.12 --> 4615.04
anyway the first one was just so [ __ ]

4612.4 --> 4616.799999999999
lame it's unbelievable like it's an

4615.04 --> 4621.21
insult that that thing even was a

4616.8 --> 4624.34
success that's an insult to me

4621.21 --> 4624.34
[Music]

4636.239 --> 4639.839999999999
anyway

4637.199 --> 4639.839999999999
that happened

4641.12 --> 4646.88
it's like when i clicked it to watch it

4644.08 --> 4650.08
then like after 50 minutes is like

4646.88 --> 4652.0
why am i watching this

4650.08 --> 4654.8
i still kept watching it and then

4652.0 --> 4658.64
halfway i was like oh come on

4654.8 --> 4658.64
this can't be this shitty

4658.96 --> 4662.4800000000005
and then

4660.239 --> 4664.48
and then i just like finished it because

4662.48 --> 4666.959999999999
i just like okay now i want to know

4664.48 --> 4668.959999999999
exactly how [ __ ] lame it is

4666.96 --> 4671.28
so that i can imprint it and never

4668.96 --> 4672.4
accidentally click this shitty movie

4671.28 --> 4675.199
again

4672.4 --> 4678.32
because now i will remember how [ __ ]

4675.199 --> 4679.44
lame it is

4678.32 --> 4682.239
right

4679.44 --> 4684.719
and the second one might be better

4682.239 --> 4688.5199999999995
it's probably with the mini me and fat

4684.719 --> 4688.52
bastard and all that

4702.4 --> 4708.16
they all the same oh [ __ ]

4705.44 --> 4711.3589999999995

4762.239 --> 4766.639999999999
i mean that already sounds like a lot

4764.8 --> 4769.1990000000005
more interesting than what i actually

4766.64 --> 4772.159000000001
watched i mean the movie was nothing

4769.199 --> 4774.239
it was just nothing it was just lame

4772.159 --> 4777.679
nothing interesting happened it was just

4774.239 --> 4778.959999999999
gross and lame and super insulting

4777.679 --> 4781.4400000000005
to women

4778.96 --> 4785.04
right and i i like a little bit of a

4781.44 --> 4785.04
sexist attitude i kind of like

4785.28 --> 4788.719
original james bond

4787.44 --> 4792.08
like

4788.719 --> 4795.76

an infection that causes somebody to

4944.32 --> 4948.239
become a serial killer wow that sounds

4949.92 --> 4954.2390000000005
not particularly interesting

4957.679 --> 4963.12
wow this thing has his own wiki

4960.32 --> 4963.12
very large

4968.32 --> 4971.04

4985.52 --> 4990.719
a biological agent i mean

4988.239 --> 4994.159
that's just immediately

4990.719 --> 4996.4800000000005
unless it's literally syphilis

4994.159 --> 4998.879999999999
that's a parasite right

4996.48 --> 5001.04
i mean parasites are the only real

4998.88 --> 5002.4800000000005
biological agents that could even do

5001.04 --> 5004.239
anything like that

5002.48 --> 5006.4
in the direction

5004.239 --> 5008.959999999999
better than austin powell yeah

5006.4 --> 5011.96
that's not yeah okay clutch you're right

5008.96 --> 5011.96
probably

5014.48 --> 5019.5199999999995
what the hell

5016.88 --> 5023.36
it was for six and older

5019.52 --> 5023.360000000001
that is just so wrong

5024.0 --> 5028.44
how the hell did it get through

5030.159 --> 5037.0
like

5031.36 --> 5037.0
how how the hell did that get through

5065.04 --> 5069.76
yes we just seen it i realized that but

5067.52 --> 5071.52
this was like a 90s movie i don't

5069.76 --> 5072.400000000001
understand how the hell did it get

5071.52 --> 5075.360000000001
through

5072.4 --> 5077.679
6 plus that is like

5075.36 --> 5081.239
it's just like enough this is in your

5077.679 --> 5081.2390000000005
face man

5084.8 --> 5088.88
i mean

5086.96 --> 5091.679
in my opinion that kind of falls under

5088.88 --> 5093.28
the sexualization of children really if

5091.679 --> 5096.2390000000005
that's six plus who the hell

5093.28 --> 5096.239
greenlighted that

5097.52 --> 5099.84
i mean

5102.239 --> 5106.0
six plus means

5105.199 --> 5107.5199999999995
you

5106.0 --> 5110.239
according to that

5107.52 --> 5113.280000000001
thing you could just put your kid six

5110.239 --> 5114.32
years old behind the television watching

5113.28 --> 5116.719
that

5114.32 --> 5119.199
on their own

5116.719 --> 5121.12
think that's a good idea

5119.199 --> 5124.159
no

5121.12 --> 5126.48
no you definitely want pg you definitely

5124.159 --> 5129.12
want parents there with them if they

5126.48 --> 5131.36
watch a movie like that i mean what the

5129.12 --> 5131.36
[ __ ]

5135.26 --> 5140.88
[Music]

5136.88 --> 5144.400000000001
it's a grooming [ __ ] man i mean because

5140.88 --> 5148.32
of that i mean if it was like 18 plus

5144.4 --> 5151.92
or or pg 13 or whatever the [ __ ]

5148.32 --> 5154.239
how that's designated but not six plus

5151.92 --> 5156.159
if it was just like a more adult movie

5154.239 --> 5159.12
that's like oh you can watch it with the

5156.159 --> 5161.679
family if you're like in a bit liberal

5159.12 --> 5164.0
then i'd get it but like six

5161.679 --> 5165.12
you could just watch that on your own

5164.0 --> 5166.96
six

5165.12 --> 5170.239
what the [ __ ]

5166.96 --> 5172.56
i mean this is no

5170.239 --> 5174.959999999999
dorady explorer or something like what

5172.56 --> 5174.96
the [ __ ]

5179.04 --> 5182.88
you watched movies like evil dead when

5180.96 --> 5184.0
you were six well yeah that's your

5182.88 --> 5187.84
problem

5184.0 --> 5187.84
that's absolutely not allowed

5188.96 --> 5193.12
i mean

5190.4 --> 5196.839999999999
fairly sure it's 12 plus

5193.12 --> 5196.84
like on the dvd

5197.12 --> 5199.679
or whatever

5203.36 --> 5207.5199999999995
evil dead was funny as [ __ ]

5205.44 --> 5211.839999999999
that's true

5207.52 --> 5211.84
but it's not for little kids

5213.679 --> 5218.639
i mean it is freaking violent dude

5216.32 --> 5220.0
that's like 12 plus right

5218.639 --> 5222.4800000000005
when that starts that's how they

5220.0 --> 5225.84
designated it

5222.48 --> 5225.839999999999
when you're six no

5226.48 --> 5229.48
anyway

5244.4 --> 5249.199
hey you film

5246.4 --> 5250.879999999999
you never even heard of that

5249.199 --> 5251.759999999999
did you see that but yeah i haven't

5250.88 --> 5254.400000000001
really

5251.76 --> 5255.84
look i just go by the old standards how

5254.4 --> 5258.638999999999
i remember it

5255.84 --> 5260.8
i don't even

5258.639 --> 5262.719
understand like how that all works right

5260.8 --> 5264.84
now i think that just the systems

5262.719 --> 5267.679
corrupted so badly

5264.84 --> 5270.679
that the designations are just going

5267.679 --> 5270.679
insane

5287.92 --> 5290.92
anyway

5297.12 --> 5301.239
oh universal right

5308.56 --> 5311.76
freaking fly here

5311.84 --> 5315.96
get the hell out of here

5334.48 --> 5343.04
it's g for little kids right

5338.36 --> 5343.04
[Music]

5359.92 --> 5364.56
right anyway i didn't want to just end

5362.08 --> 5366.48
up talking about movies again it's just

5364.56 --> 5369.52
i happened to watch this and it was just

5366.48 --> 5369.5199999999995
so disappointed

5369.76 --> 5373.84
although i should have expected that

5372.56 --> 5375.6
it just

5373.84 --> 5377.6
it's probably the first movie it's

5375.6 --> 5380.320000000001
really [ __ ] lame and

5377.6 --> 5382.0
the second one is probably a little less

5380.32 --> 5385.36
lame

5382.0 --> 5385.36
i don't know i'll find out

5389.12 --> 5394.8
but yeah it's certainly not a

5391.04 --> 5397.5199999999995
a movie i recommend anybody

5394.8 --> 5399.12
unless you like wanna do research on

5397.52 --> 5400.159000000001
just stupid

5399.12 --> 5401.76
[ __ ]

5400.159 --> 5403.599999999999
from the 90s

5401.76 --> 5405.04
and like how the hell did they get this

5403.6 --> 5408.8
through

5405.04 --> 5410.159
to be rated six years and plus just the

5408.8 --> 5413.96
[ __ ]

5410.159 --> 5413.96
that makes no sense

5427.679 --> 5430.679
hmm

5449.63 --> 5452.669
[Music]

5455.6 --> 5458.400000000001
yeah

5456.48 --> 5459.5199999999995
oh by the way yeah something more

5458.4 --> 5462.32
interesting

5459.52 --> 5464.96
quantum of conscious finally had a a

5462.32 --> 5466.639
more elaborate analysis about the

5464.96 --> 5468.8
sandman

5466.639 --> 5472.0
netflix series

5468.8 --> 5475.88
and good interesting

5472.0 --> 5475.88
i appreciated that

5477.199 --> 5480.638999999999
it's much more interesting than

5479.52 --> 5483.679
freaking

5480.639 --> 5483.679
austin powers

5486.4 --> 5492.239
and yeah i haven't really like reviewed

5488.719 --> 5494.08
any specific details about it

5492.239 --> 5496.638999999999
it's just because so many other people

5494.08 --> 5496.639
doing that

5497.6 --> 5501.360000000001
but yeah

5499.12 --> 5505.12
there were very impressive elements and

5501.36 --> 5508.5599999999995
it seems like everybody's just agreeing

5505.12 --> 5510.239
like it started out really really

5508.56 --> 5511.52
intense and good

5510.239 --> 5515.839999999999
and then

5511.52 --> 5517.4400000000005
started to reveal itself as being

5515.84 --> 5520.2390000000005
all

5517.44 --> 5522.08
mixed race relationships and the rest is

5520.239 --> 5523.919999999999
gay

5522.08 --> 5526.32
slowly

5523.92 --> 5528.96
still with good story development and

5526.32 --> 5532.5599999999995
good examples and then eventually it

5528.96 --> 5536.159
starts to like really just become just

5532.56 --> 5536.159000000001
gay and race mixing and

5536.88 --> 5540.08
with a couple of interesting things that

5538.88 --> 5543.67
happen in between that

5540.08 --> 5543.67
[Music]

5544.0 --> 5548.639
it gets worse

5546.48 --> 5550.32
so

5548.639 --> 5553.4400000000005
yeah if there's going to be a second

5550.32 --> 5555.84
season of this i guarantee you

5553.44 --> 5557.839999999999
that this freaking

5555.84 --> 5560.8
endless of lust

5557.84 --> 5562.719
is probably gonna start dominating and i

5560.8 --> 5564.320000000001
don't know man it's gonna get really

5562.719 --> 5566.4
freaking gay

5564.32 --> 5568.4
i bet you the second season is gonna be

5566.4 --> 5571.36
like one of the gayest netflix shows

5568.4 --> 5571.36
you've ever seen

5571.6 --> 5576.400000000001
if lust actually gets involved it's

5573.76 --> 5578.400000000001
gonna get really [ __ ] up

5576.4 --> 5580.799999999999
they might even literally throw in like

5578.4 --> 5583.599999999999
gay nightmares and [ __ ]

5580.8 --> 5583.6
i don't know man

5584.639 --> 5590.32
i have a bad feeling about it i mean

5588.32 --> 5594.08
it's like a really well developed

5590.32 --> 5596.08
universe the cgi is great

5594.08 --> 5599.04
good actors even

5596.08 --> 5601.679
they really do kind of pull it off

5599.04 --> 5604.08
like even the vortex girl

5601.679 --> 5607.12
i i kind of liked her

5604.08 --> 5607.12
i sympathized

5608.08 --> 5610.639
and

5609.76 --> 5613.280000000001
just

5610.639 --> 5615.52
but just the way the the players that

5613.28 --> 5618.4
have been that has showed their faces

5615.52 --> 5621.52
you already know oh my god this is this

5618.4 --> 5624.08
could get so freaking bad in the second

5621.52 --> 5625.92
season unbelievable

5624.08 --> 5628.32
i mean

5625.92 --> 5628.32
ugh

5628.48 --> 5635.599999999999
like serious they already had a freaking

5631.84 --> 5637.360000000001
serial killer convention yeah

5635.6 --> 5639.120000000001
that was pretty shocking right well if

5637.36 --> 5641.28
they're willing to go there that can you

5639.12 --> 5644.8
just imagine what would happen when they

5641.28 --> 5648.5599999999995
look unleash the real gayness

5644.8 --> 5648.56
holy [ __ ] dude

5648.639 --> 5653.84
holy [ __ ]

5650.4 --> 5655.36
i mean this could literally be just like

5653.84 --> 5658.8
killer

5655.36 --> 5661.36
[ __ ] clown demons and [ __ ] i don't it

5658.8 --> 5662.320000000001
could go there guys you realize that

5661.36 --> 5665.199
right

5662.32 --> 5668.159
i mean the the play the pawns that have

5665.199 --> 5671.36
been set on the table

5668.159 --> 5673.36
for the second season

5671.36 --> 5677.04
i mean this could be like

5673.36 --> 5679.599999999999
the red wedding all over again

5677.04 --> 5682.08
except in this case it's like

5679.6 --> 5684.639
the the gay

5682.08 --> 5687.84
red wedding it could be the red wedding

5684.639 --> 5687.84
of all gayness

5697.6 --> 5703.639
okay cleary

5699.52 --> 5703.639
what what are you talking about

5709.65 --> 5712.8099999999995
[Music]

5720.56 --> 5724.639
oh not watched that yet oh sorry for the

5722.56 --> 5726.96
spoilers then p just seen it

5724.639 --> 5726.96
sorry

5727.6 --> 5733.04
i mean it is definitely worth watchable

5729.84 --> 5733.04
just because of like the

5733.52 --> 5739.119000000001
the dreamscape mechanism like they have

5736.08 --> 5742.5599999999995
a real good interplanar thing going it's

5739.119 --> 5744.799999999999
it's just a really interesting thing

5742.56 --> 5744.8
and

5745.04 --> 5751.76
well developed like it has very

5747.76 --> 5753.88
seriously developed spirit mechanics

5751.76 --> 5757.84
enveloped within it and a lot of

5753.88 --> 5760.08
philosophical questioning

5757.84 --> 5761.84
in an interesting way

5760.08 --> 5765.679
so

5761.84 --> 5767.28
it's like a really really well developed

5765.679 --> 5769.679
medium

5767.28 --> 5772.48
but there's like

5769.679 --> 5774.4800000000005
devils in there

5772.48 --> 5777.839999999999
like blatant

5774.48 --> 5781.678999999999
like there's evil potential in there

5777.84 --> 5785.84
and they might just unleash it

5781.679 --> 5785.84
like the next season or something

5786.96 --> 5792.639
the mind battle between him and the bib

5789.199 --> 5792.638999999999
that was if you thought so

5794.0 --> 5797.719
i thought it was cute

5798.4 --> 5801.599999999999
i mean

5799.28 --> 5801.599999999999
yeah

5803.92 --> 5809.1990000000005
i didn't think it was all that bad

5805.6 --> 5810.96
really it was a little cringy

5809.199 --> 5813.839999999999
but especially because it wasn't the

5810.96 --> 5815.119
draw the universe like that ruined it

5813.84 --> 5818.400000000001
like dude

5815.119 --> 5821.28
just leave the [ __ ] shitty ass

5818.4 --> 5823.599999999999
heliocentric cosmology out of your

5821.28 --> 5826.08
[ __ ] stories you pieces of [ __ ]

5823.6 --> 5829.360000000001
hollywood scumbags

5826.08 --> 5831.36
leave that [ __ ] out of there

5829.36 --> 5833.679
it's crap

5831.36 --> 5835.759999999999
nobody believes it yeah

5833.679 --> 5838.639
you're gonna get into dreamscapes and

5835.76 --> 5841.92
[ __ ] leave the [ __ ] heliocentrism out

5838.639 --> 5844.56
of it it's not real it never was real

5841.92 --> 5847.76
only bring it up as a mind control

5844.56 --> 5850.639
device which it is

5847.76 --> 5853.84
i mean it's literally a crafted dream

5850.639 --> 5856.96
that's not real you're not gonna brag

5853.84 --> 5858.88
from one endless to another how you did

5856.96 --> 5863.119
that with the freaking

5858.88 --> 5865.6
galaxy or something it's total horse

5863.119 --> 5867.44

5875.6 --> 5880.96
[ __ ] with your [ __ ]

5878.44 --> 5883.44
heliocentrism plants

5880.96 --> 5886.159
totally unnecessary

5883.44 --> 5887.5199999999995
you should have left that [ __ ] out

5886.159 --> 5890.48
what's next

5887.52 --> 5892.639

5930.4 --> 5934.0
match

5931.84 --> 5938.0
it's a different

5934.0 --> 5941.52
world it's a different fantasy if it's

5938.0 --> 5944.48

6043.36 --> 6046.599999999999
all right

6052.38 --> 6055.619
[Music]

6062.84 --> 6068.2390000000005
hey all right anyway gideon's sick yeah

6071.28 --> 6076.48
[ __ ] [ __ ] galaxy [ __ ] out of

6074.0 --> 6079.6
there they left that one out

6076.48 --> 6081.678999999999
and they just set the world

6079.6 --> 6083.4400000000005
the world and all the spirit realms or

6081.679 --> 6088.159
something like that

6083.44 --> 6090.239
no [ __ ] star [ __ ]

6088.159 --> 6092.48
look at all the lights oh i can make a

6090.239 --> 6097.28
picture of a [ __ ] virtual galaxy that

6092.48 --> 6100.08
doesn't belong in a fantasy movie or

6097.28 --> 6104.0
series like that because that's [ __ ]

6100.08 --> 6105.84
it's like putting stupid planet [ __ ]

6104.0 --> 6108.719
in freaking lord of the rings you

6105.84 --> 6111.28
goddamn morons

6108.719 --> 6115.04
keep your [ __ ]

6111.28 --> 6117.92
fantasy [ __ ] sci-fi out of actual

6115.04 --> 6118.88
fantasy movies and franchises you hear

6117.92 --> 6123.84
me

6118.88 --> 6127.119
shove your [ __ ] globe up your ass

not in fantasy

6127.119 --> 6132.0
[ __ ] off

6129.28 --> 6134.719
it's enough science fiction [ __ ]

6132.0 --> 6137.76
movies out there for everybody to be all

6134.719 --> 6140.4
squirty over yeah leave it out of the

6137.76 --> 6142.88
goddamn fantasy

6140.4 --> 6145.759999999999
nobody wants it there

6142.88 --> 6148.0
nope nerds don't care about that [ __ ]

6145.76 --> 6149.04
yeah they're not even gonna watch it

6148.0 --> 6152.4
they just

6149.04 --> 6153.36
don't like that they don't care

6152.4 --> 6154.239
don't

6153.36 --> 6158.08
mix

6154.239 --> 6160.799999999999
sci-fi with fantasy yeah

6158.08 --> 6163.84
don't do it it's stupid

6160.8 --> 6163.84
it's [ __ ] stupid

6164.56 --> 6171.280000000001
unless it is a completely enveloped

6167.52 --> 6173.84
sci-fi ish fantasy-ish galaxy and it's

6171.28 --> 6176.0
like space wars with elves and dwarves

6173.84 --> 6178.719
and what do you want to do that fine

6176.0 --> 6180.8
that could work right because it is a

6178.719 --> 6183.84
full-on immersed hybrid

6180.8 --> 6186.159000000001
yeah if it's gonna be pure fantasy we

6183.84 --> 6187.119000000001
don't want a freaking

6186.159 --> 6189.839999999999
minute

6187.119 --> 6194.159
with a [ __ ] heliocentric [ __ ]

6200.4 --> 6205.799999999999

6201.76 --> 6205.8

6206.96 --> 6210.96

that

6219.6 --> 6223.1990000000005
that would have been amazing

6225.36 --> 6228.159
well

6226.32 --> 6231.199
you're right

6228.159 --> 6234.08
that would have been absolutely amazing

6231.199 --> 6235.04
even though i thought that the hope

6234.08 --> 6237.04
was

6235.04 --> 6239.5199999999995
a good response

6237.04 --> 6243.84
it's just we don't need your freaking

6239.52 --> 6245.119000000001
stupid space galaxy [ __ ] yeah

6243.84 --> 6248.159000000001

6245.119 --> 6250.799999999999
what the [ __ ] are you even doing lucifer

6248.159 --> 6253.5199999999995
you want domain of the earth

6250.8 --> 6254.4800000000005

6254.48 --> 6259.678999999999
why don't you go rule there then right

6256.96 --> 6261.36
god rules like oh is earth the earth is

6259.679 --> 6263.679
a special place why don't you go to the

6261.36 --> 6265.679
other places then if they're there you

6263.679 --> 6268.0
dumbass

6265.679 --> 6269.4400000000005
no you don't because they don't exist

6268.0 --> 6271.6
you [ __ ] wit

6269.44 --> 6274.159
even the freaking lucifer angel knows

6271.6 --> 6276.159000000001
that come on

6274.159 --> 6277.92
stupid

6276.159 --> 6280.719
unnecessary

6277.92 --> 6280.719
annoying

6282.88 --> 6286.08
right i'm done with this

6287.36 --> 6293.119
don't need hope just the truth

6289.199 --> 6293.119
technically yes you you're correct

6293.6 --> 6296.84
you're correct

6307.199 --> 6311.119
and you know what what you could even

6310.32 --> 6314.159
like

6311.119 --> 6317.28
get visuals of that like if he would say

6314.159 --> 6318.48
like oh i'm dying the galaxy's dying and

6317.28 --> 6320.719
like

6318.48 --> 6324.08
earth is flat

6320.719 --> 6324.08
and then you see lucifer like

6324.32 --> 6328.5599999999995
and then literally falls over on her

6326.719 --> 6330.96
back and then boom

6328.56 --> 6332.96
a glass dome like

6330.96 --> 6335.04
luxer up

6332.96 --> 6337.199
now that

6335.04 --> 6340.0
guys

6337.199 --> 6341.839999999999
that would have been so freaking surreal

6340.0 --> 6344.239
that would have like literally blown the

6341.84 --> 6347.8
top of people's head all over the world

6344.239 --> 6347.799999999999
that they've done that

6359.6 --> 6364.320000000001
and then she like

6362.08 --> 6366.08
lucifer could have been like okay i'm

6364.32 --> 6367.28
done here

6366.08 --> 6369.84
why did you

6367.28 --> 6372.639
how dare you remind me

6369.84 --> 6375.84
right that would have been epic how dare

6372.639 --> 6378.56
you to remind me dream

6375.84 --> 6381.119000000001
how dare you do that

6378.56 --> 6382.639
you can have your freaking helmet now

6381.119 --> 6384.96
get out

6382.639 --> 6386.400000000001
that would have been freaking epic and

6384.96 --> 6389.44
you'd know it

6386.4 --> 6389.44
you know it would be

6389.76 --> 6394.119000000001
right

6390.639 --> 6394.119
gideon's sick

6410.0 --> 6414.96
can i get some feedback

6412.239 --> 6417.678999999999
anybody did everybody leave because i

6414.96 --> 6417.679
got angry

6417.76 --> 6423.320000000001
or is everybody just falling asleep

6419.679 --> 6423.32
because it's so hot

6432.239 --> 6440.08
exactly it was in the realm of dreams

6435.84 --> 6440.08
and you know lucifer is delusional

6440.719 --> 6444.08
so it would have

6442.159 --> 6445.759999999999
look if that would have been the

6444.08 --> 6448.4
response

6445.76 --> 6450.88
it's flat and

6448.4 --> 6452.08
falling all on her back and then bang

6450.88 --> 6455.119
dumb

6452.08 --> 6457.679
and she'd be like how dare you do that

6455.119 --> 6460.48
how dare you tell me

6457.679 --> 6462.0
get out take your helm and get out of my

6460.48 --> 6464.5599999999995
realm

6462.0 --> 6467.28
that would have been like the most epic

6464.56 --> 6469.52
scene in the entire series

6467.28 --> 6470.4
and everybody would be like what what

6469.52 --> 6473.92
what

6470.4 --> 6473.92
what are you talking about what

6475.28 --> 6478.32
and still protect their dogma that's

6477.28 --> 6481.28
right

6478.32 --> 6482.5599999999995
that's right so some i bet some freaking

6481.28 --> 6485.44
clip dick

6482.56 --> 6487.679
scumbag just squirted and shat their

6485.44 --> 6489.759999999999
pants when the actual

6487.679 --> 6492.639
scriptwriter suggested this and they're

6489.76 --> 6496.4800000000005
like oh no no no okay

6492.639 --> 6499.36
no hope it's about hope i bet somebody

6496.48 --> 6502.32
like last minute edited the script and

6499.36 --> 6505.679
ruined it i mean

6502.32 --> 6508.32
it's too beautiful not to do it it would

6505.679 --> 6513.639
have actively had to be ruined

6508.32 --> 6513.639
to not do that almost right

6519.52 --> 6524.84
i should have done it

6522.48 --> 6527.28
it would have been freaking

6524.84 --> 6530.639
amazing right and it would be like the

6527.28 --> 6530.639
perfect distraction too

6530.8 --> 6532.639
like

6531.92 --> 6536.639
if

6532.639 --> 6538.32
lucifer was like how dare you remind me

6536.639 --> 6541.119
get out take your helmet get out that

6538.32 --> 6543.84
would have been like the that would have

6541.119 --> 6546.48
moved the attention away from what was

6543.84 --> 6550.32
just said in the first place as lucifer

6546.48 --> 6552.08
herself would want to do in that moment

6550.32 --> 6554.0
and everybody would be pulled with it

6552.08 --> 6556.8
and it's like oh dream just won saying

6554.0 --> 6557.92
the earth is flat what okay

6556.8 --> 6559.360000000001
weird

6557.92 --> 6562.639
but they wouldn't have been like what

6559.36 --> 6565.04
what is this how dare you no it because

6562.639 --> 6569.84
it's dream

6565.04 --> 6569.84
it's the place to do that

6577.76 --> 6582.119000000001
let somebody ruin it

6591.04 --> 6597.84
jack dog taking a bath

6594.08 --> 6597.84
it was look so hilarious

6598.43 --> 6601.599
[Music]

6600.719 --> 6603.119
oh

6601.599 --> 6606.76
he doesn't like any

6603.119 --> 6606.759999999999
looking at him

6612.719 --> 6617.28
yeah by the way i got eight white

6614.8 --> 6619.92
pigeons for some reason i counted them

6617.28 --> 6621.759999999999
now there's a flock

6619.92 --> 6624.76
eight eight

6621.76 --> 6624.76
pigeons

6625.76 --> 6631.119000000001
perfectly white

6628.239 --> 6634.239
and they all come here for a drink

6631.119 --> 6636.799999999999
and the crows don't like them

6634.239 --> 6638.48
they like to like crows and

6636.8 --> 6640.400000000001
even the uh

6638.48 --> 6643.199
jackdaws they like to like scare them

6640.4 --> 6646.32
away they're like you're inferior get

6643.199 --> 6647.839999999999
out this is our water like pigeons

6646.32 --> 6650.159
literally desperately want to get a

6647.84 --> 6650.159000000001
drink

6650.639 --> 6654.56
and then the jack dog will literally

6652.48 --> 6656.638999999999
like bum rush them and then just start

6654.56 --> 6659.119000000001
taking a bath so they can't get that

6656.639 --> 6662.4400000000005
water literally i've seen them do that

6659.119 --> 6662.44
total bastards

6666.0 --> 6670.639
so yeah the crow

6668.32 --> 6673.759999999999
family type birds don't like the white

6670.639 --> 6673.76
pigeons at all

6676.719 --> 6680.119
but i do

6690.719 --> 6693.719
ah

6694.56 --> 6696.8
right

6697.04 --> 6700.4
anyway quantum unconscious had an

6698.719 --> 6703.36
interesting video if you haven't watched

6700.4 --> 6705.44
that it was good it was basically a a

6703.36 --> 6706.88
partial review

6705.44 --> 6709.199
of the uh

6706.88 --> 6713.32
sandman series and i thought that his

6709.199 --> 6713.32
analysis is very fair

6715.31 --> 6729.679
[Music]

6725.599 --> 6729.679
simple tools yeah yeah pgcnet

6729.76 --> 6732.08
all right

6734.239 --> 6738.48
pigeons are like timid

6737.28 --> 6741.119
right

6738.48 --> 6742.5599999999995
they're they flee pigeons are good at

6741.119 --> 6745.04
fleeing

6742.56 --> 6747.4400000000005
they're they're timid

6745.04 --> 6749.36
crow types are fighters and they will

6747.44 --> 6753.36
defend themselves and they would even

6749.36 --> 6756.0
like they dominate other species

6753.36 --> 6758.48
but not like to destroy them but just to

6756.0 --> 6760.56
be recognized as their superior so like

6758.48 --> 6764.32
the crows among

6760.56 --> 6767.119000000001
jackdaws and magpies are superior

6764.32 --> 6769.44
jackdaws and magpie seem on an equal

6767.119 --> 6770.5599999999995
level socially

6769.44 --> 6771.919999999999
but yeah

6770.56 --> 6773.92
magpies are

6771.92 --> 6775.599
you know bit like the jew birds among

6773.92 --> 6778.56
the crow types

6775.599 --> 6782.2390000000005
they always make a lot of noise and

6778.56 --> 6782.2390000000005
they're like flustered and [ __ ]

6783.28 --> 6785.28
and

6784.159 --> 6787.199
like

6785.28 --> 6789.28
very moody

6787.199 --> 6791.199
but crows definitely are claiming

6789.28 --> 6792.88
superiority and everybody does treat

6791.199 --> 6796.719
them like that it's like oh the crow is

6792.88 --> 6796.719
coming oh get out of the way

6802.48 --> 6808.159
scarecrow is coming what

6805.199 --> 6808.159
are you talking about

6818.08 --> 6821.199
right anyway i hope you guys are liking

6819.76 --> 6824.88
my show

6821.199 --> 6826.879999999999
despite some of my outbursts

6824.88 --> 6830.0
or maybe you like it because of it i

6826.88 --> 6833.1990000000005
don't know sometimes it's just

6830.0 --> 6835.199
sometimes unexpectedly it's just i go

6833.199 --> 6837.598999999999
through things i tap into something and

6835.199 --> 6840.159
then it's like a drill hole and shoots

6837.599 --> 6842.32
through and then suddenly it's like ah

6840.159 --> 6844.4
my grievances and then i'm gonna be very

6842.32 --> 6846.639
much expressing those grievances for the

6844.4 --> 6848.5599999999995
moment and then i'll just afterward calm

6846.639 --> 6851.28
down again unless somebody thinks oh

6848.56 --> 6853.1990000000005
you're not supposed to do that and then

6851.28 --> 6854.8
i get pissed off at them

6853.199 --> 6858.159
and ban them

6854.8 --> 6858.159000000001
and then i get back to normal

6860.32 --> 6865.759999999999
[ __ ] attack a huge seagull really

6863.44 --> 6865.759999999999
huh

6869.52 --> 6874.639
are you sure it didn't just like die off

6871.679 --> 6874.639
the heat i mean

6874.8 --> 6878.08
foxes are like

6876.639 --> 6881.1990000000005
scavengers

6878.08 --> 6886.08
they do eat corpses specifically so

6881.199 --> 6886.08
they a fox will just eat a corpse

6886.88 --> 6890.719
some dead bird just fell out of the sky

6888.96 --> 6893.36
from the heat or something or crashed

6890.719 --> 6895.119
into a truck i think well

6893.36 --> 6896.239
foxes don't typically hang around the

6895.119 --> 6898.0
road but

6896.239 --> 6900.718999999999
you know what i mean

6898.0 --> 6902.159
like they don't necessarily catch live

6900.719 --> 6904.88
prey

6902.159 --> 6905.598999999999
so unless you literally see them catch

6904.88 --> 6907.52
it

6905.599 --> 6909.4400000000005
while it's still alive it's more likely

6907.52 --> 6911.76
that it just caught

6909.44 --> 6912.879999999999
a seagull that was just lying dead

6911.76 --> 6914.88
somewhere

6912.88 --> 6916.84
i don't know

6914.88 --> 6921.04
hello

6916.84 --> 6921.04
dx good afternoon to you too

6923.15 --> 6928.48
[Music]

6924.32 --> 6928.48
ah temperatures a lot better now here

6931.04 --> 6936.63
because the sun is no longer hitting the

6934.0 --> 6939.84
wall

6936.63 --> 6939.84
[Music]

6950.08 --> 6952.32
hmm

6954.56 --> 6959.679
that's that's funny pgc net that's

6957.04 --> 6962.0
really weird because foxes are extremely

6959.679 --> 6964.32
shy of people so

6962.0 --> 6967.679
that's odd that it would

6964.32 --> 6967.679
get close to a city even

6972.88 --> 6979.92
oh really

6975.199 --> 6979.919999999999
so you actually saw it catching it wow

6980.96 --> 6988.04
i've never seen anything like that

6983.679 --> 6988.04
oh there we go it's my camera again

7004.88 --> 7007.88
hmm

7021.76 --> 7026.719
yeah anyway i don't get to see any foxes

7024.4 --> 7028.799999999999
over here

7026.719 --> 7031.84
i don't even know if we still have wild

7028.8 --> 7031.84
foxes that much

7033.84 --> 7038.08
i think it's pretty rare

7036.56 --> 7040.719
i mean i think there's still some of

7038.08 --> 7043.36
them around like in the forest like the

7040.719 --> 7046.159
actual forest

7043.36 --> 7047.92
more landing word

7046.159 --> 7051.5199999999995
but those

7047.92 --> 7052.56
don't really go out to like city areas

7051.52 --> 7055.119000000001
or anything

7052.56 --> 7057.4400000000005
so weird weird

7055.119 --> 7058.4
i've never seen like a fox

7057.44 --> 7061.839999999999
do that

7058.4 --> 7064.159
maybe in spain i did one time

7061.84 --> 7067.04
yeah that's right i did actually

7064.159 --> 7069.36
when i went to vacation in spain

7067.04 --> 7070.639
i did a couple of times see a fox and

7069.36 --> 7073.679
that was like

7070.639 --> 7075.28
at a village

7073.679 --> 7076.56
like in the middle of the hot summer and

7075.28 --> 7077.84
they would just like

7076.56 --> 7080.4800000000005
[Music]

7077.84 --> 7080.4800000000005
certainly just

7081.599 --> 7084.96
also

7082.719 --> 7087.92
get like throw over trash cans kind of

7084.96 --> 7089.84
like raccoons i've seen that

7087.92 --> 7093.119
i've never seen a raccoon before but i

7089.84 --> 7095.360000000001
have seen foxes like in spain

7093.119 --> 7097.759999999999
but they were extremely shy of humans so

7095.36 --> 7099.199
as soon as they realized that you saw

7097.76 --> 7103.4800000000005
them and that you wanted to approach

7099.199 --> 7103.48
them they would immediately run off

7119.52 --> 7124.8
yeah but foxes look if they get too

7122.08 --> 7127.36
cheeky that's not good because foxes are

7124.8 --> 7129.76
kind of gross

7127.36 --> 7131.839999999999
i mean they literally just kill animals

7129.76 --> 7135.52
and then leave them rotting at times and

7131.84 --> 7135.52
that's like not good

7139.36 --> 7144.639
if they get inside your chicken coop

7141.119 --> 7144.639
they'll just kill everything

7144.96 --> 7147.44
terrible

7148.8 --> 7152.159000000001
foxes are gross

7152.48 --> 7157.638999999999
they look kind of cute but they are

7154.239 --> 7157.638999999999
really gross

7164.8 --> 7167.599
the sound they make is like a witch

7166.32 --> 7169.04
scream

7167.599 --> 7173.8
they have a weird

7169.04 --> 7173.8
high-pitched voice that's right

7189.44 --> 7194.159
there's a pack of wolves in the

7190.719 --> 7195.84
netherlands oh really huh

7194.159 --> 7199.839999999999
well those must be from germany then

7195.84 --> 7199.84
because there are wolves in germany

7203.119 --> 7209.03
again i think

7205.86 --> 7209.03
[Music]

7257.28 --> 7260.88
what

7258.8 --> 7262.56
that's ridiculous dear like wolves

7260.88 --> 7264.639
shouldn't be

7262.56 --> 7266.88
doing that

7264.639 --> 7269.04
i mean you really don't want freaking

7266.88 --> 7271.4400000000005
wolves to just wander in villages and

7269.04 --> 7271.44
all that

7271.92 --> 7275.04
that is not good

7279.52 --> 7284.88
i mean if that would just be like

7282.159 --> 7287.598999999999
allowed then eventually there's gonna

7284.88 --> 7288.8
like kids just freaking get attacked by

7287.599 --> 7291.52
wolves

7288.8 --> 7291.52
they do that

7294.8 --> 7298.96
and pets and [ __ ] like no

7306.8 --> 7312.400000000001
roads between the woods

7310.239 --> 7314.08
right okay yeah that's that's just

7312.4 --> 7316.5599999999995
annoying

7314.08 --> 7316.5599999999995
i guess

7321.599 --> 7325.119000000001
but yeah they don't really like in the

7323.52 --> 7327.679
netherlands there are a lot of places

7325.119 --> 7328.88
where they literally made like

7327.679 --> 7331.28
uh

7328.88 --> 7334.400000000001
nature crossings right where they have

7331.28 --> 7337.36
bridges specifically

7334.4 --> 7341.5199999999995
for nature so that animals can just

7337.36 --> 7341.5199999999995
cross the road at a certain point

7342.88 --> 7348.159000000001
without risking getting run over

7345.84 --> 7351.04
they specifically designed that and it

7348.159 --> 7351.04
works great so

7351.679 --> 7356.159
that might work

7353.92 --> 7358.88
in germany if they would take the effort

7356.159 --> 7358.879999999999
for it that is

7360.639 --> 7363.639
anyway

7371.679 --> 7375.599
all right but yeah if there's any wolves

7373.599 --> 7377.360000000001
in the wild that they want to maintain

7375.599 --> 7380.08
they should just make sure that they

7377.36 --> 7383.44
keep away from civilization as much as

7380.08 --> 7385.76
possible you don't want wall

7383.44 --> 7387.598999999999
near your town you really don't

7385.76 --> 7390.639
i mean so very cool

7387.599 --> 7393.1990000000005
but just think of it like wild dogs like

7390.639 --> 7395.679
wild dogs you don't want them freaking

7393.199 --> 7397.598999999999
near your village either like wild dogs

7395.679 --> 7400.56
are arguably even more dangerous than

7397.599 --> 7403.1990000000005
freaking wolves seriously

7400.56 --> 7405.1990000000005
because they are [ __ ] in their minds

7403.199 --> 7407.5199999999995
they will literally they will

7405.199 --> 7411.199
aggressively attack anything

7407.52 --> 7413.84
wolves might attack you while dogs will

7411.199 --> 7416.719
attack you

7413.84 --> 7418.639
that's right they will guaranteed attack

7416.719 --> 7420.72
you more dangerous

7418.639 --> 7423.919
right

7420.72 --> 7423.919
[Music]

7437.92 --> 7443.599
yeah if a wild dog an actual wild dog

7441.04 --> 7446.719
attacks you then have absolutely no

7443.599 --> 7450.0
hesitation in to freaking breaking its

7446.719 --> 7450.88
neck or just killing it as quick as you

7450.0 --> 7453.44
can

7450.88 --> 7456.0
do not hesitate

7453.44 --> 7456.0
do not

7459.84 --> 7464.2390000000005
because they will literally just keep

7462.32 --> 7466.0
jumping at you jumping at you until you

7464.239 --> 7469.04
got they got you by the throat and they

7466.0 --> 7471.52
will kill you they don't care they go

7469.04 --> 7475.28
[ __ ] ape [ __ ]

7471.52 --> 7475.280000000001
wild blocks that is anyway

7477.28 --> 7483.28
hey psych bear

7478.88 --> 7487.599
what's up guys yeah late psych bear

7483.28 --> 7487.599
late i'm just about to run out my show

7489.04 --> 7495.119
but good to have you anyway

7491.52 --> 7495.119000000001
today's show was all over the place

7495.28 --> 7498.48
uh

7496.96 --> 7500.4
yeah but i am gonna run out because i'm

7498.48 --> 7502.718999999999
also getting really hungry i want some

7500.4 --> 7502.719
lunch

7504.079 --> 7508.96
go for the guts

7506.56 --> 7508.96
oof

7510.4 --> 7514.879999999999
really

7511.679 --> 7514.88
that is so [ __ ] up

7514.96 --> 7518.88
i didn't i've never encountered a wild

7516.88 --> 7521.36
dog but i heard some terrible stories

7518.88 --> 7523.36
about them that definitely have

7521.36 --> 7525.44
put them on

7523.36 --> 7527.36
alert in my mind

7525.44 --> 7530.719
like oh you see a dog

7527.36 --> 7534.5199999999995
it doesn't seem to have a master

7530.719 --> 7534.52
be freaking careful

7538.56 --> 7544.400000000001
like especially if it's multiple i mean

7540.88 --> 7546.400000000001
maybe one wild dog wouldn't be

7544.4 --> 7550.638999999999
like like that but if they're in a pack

7546.4 --> 7550.638999999999
they're gonna [ __ ] you up guaranteed

7551.679 --> 7554.079
anyway

7557.199 --> 7560.4
african wild dogs

7560.719 --> 7566.0
maybe in africa they have that too no

7563.28 --> 7570.079
but wild dogs are out there there's wild

7566.0 --> 7570.079
dogs in ireland and england and

7570.8 --> 7577.84
every place that still has some

7573.679 --> 7577.84
wilderness left around it

7579.84 --> 7585.1990000000005
but for example brian from brian's logic

7582.719 --> 7588.8
has told me a couple of times about how

7585.199 --> 7590.48
wild dogs literally attacked him

7588.8 --> 7594.28
in ireland so

7590.48 --> 7594.28
they're still out there

7604.239 --> 7606.5599999999995
what

7615.04 --> 7618.73
i don't know it's like where's the first

7616.639 --> 7621.88
time i'm hearing about it

7618.73 --> 7621.879999999999
[Music]

7624.159 --> 7628.799999999999
if they mysteriously died then yeah

7626.48 --> 7631.799999999999
let's why did you ask the owner

7628.8 --> 7631.8
right

7632.48 --> 7638.5199999999995
what radiation the [ __ ] are you talking

7635.52 --> 7638.52
about

7647.86 --> 7651.04
[Music]

7670.24 --> 7673.45
[Music]

7677.27 --> 7681.1990000000005
[Music]

7679.04 --> 7684.0
look i don't know what that is and how

7681.199 --> 7686.239
that even works

7684.0 --> 7686.239
like

7687.44 --> 7691.36
it could also be a setup it could

7689.199 --> 7694.32
literally be a freaking cattle farmer

7691.36 --> 7696.239
that's just like bailing out and then

7694.32 --> 7698.159
who he who is bailing him out is just

7696.239 --> 7699.919999999999
telling him yeah we're oh

7698.159 --> 7702.159
we're gonna make a drama out of and just

7699.92 --> 7704.32
kill them all

7702.159 --> 7708.239
i don't know it all depends on like how

7704.32 --> 7708.239
is the owner dealing with it

7710.639 --> 7714.96
or

7711.52 --> 7717.92
or arguably arguably it could be a

7714.96 --> 7720.4
completely fake story

7717.92 --> 7723.92
do you know do you know that it is

7720.4 --> 7725.119
actually real and not just fake news

7723.92 --> 7727.84
to create

7725.119 --> 7727.839999999999
food panic

7728.88 --> 7732.88
do you absolutely know it's real

7734.079 --> 7738.159
have you seen any footage and then have

7736.239 --> 7740.959999999999
you cross-referenced that footage that

7738.159 --> 7742.96
footage might be from 10 years ago how

7740.96 --> 7745.76
would you know how would you know that

7742.96 --> 7747.119
that is actually right now happening

7745.76 --> 7748.88
right

7747.119 --> 7750.5599999999995
yeah but they want it gone but that

7748.88 --> 7752.400000000001
doesn't mean that it's actually gone

7750.56 --> 7753.52
they could literally just gaslight

7752.4 --> 7755.28
everybody

7753.52 --> 7757.92
they're all dying oh the cows are all

7755.28 --> 7760.0
dying right maybe to induce a panic

7757.92 --> 7762.2390000000005
among cow owners that are like oh no i

7760.0 --> 7764.639
don't want to lose my cows too

7762.239 --> 7767.759999999999
i'll take that deal then

7764.639 --> 7771.52
yeah could be a ruse

7767.76 --> 7774.159000000001
unless you palpably have confirmation

7771.52 --> 7775.599
unless you literally see the dead cow

7774.159 --> 7777.92
bodies

7775.599 --> 7780.96
yourself with your own eyes without a

7777.92 --> 7780.96
screen in between

7781.28 --> 7786.4
dude if they're gonna

7783.28 --> 7788.96
fake freaking school shootings

7786.4 --> 7790.48
for decades you think that they couldn't

7788.96 --> 7794.4
fake

7790.48 --> 7796.959999999999
cow deaths and animal deaths too

7794.4 --> 7799.44
of course they could

7796.96 --> 7801.119
and they would have reason to

7799.44 --> 7804.638999999999
they want all the

7801.119 --> 7807.36
farmers and all that to sell out to them

7804.639 --> 7809.92
how do you make somebody sell out by

7807.36 --> 7812.079
creating fear that they're gonna lose

7809.92 --> 7815.36
everything if they don't

7812.079 --> 7819.44
that's how you do it it's basic

7815.36 --> 7819.44
propaganda racketeering

7821.84 --> 7827.76
hey lhg late

7825.36 --> 7828.92

7836.079 --> 7839.5199999999995
blah blah blah blah

7840.0 --> 7845.679
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah no no

7842.8 --> 7845.679
actual pictures

7849.04 --> 7854.96
yeah so no proof then it's just a blah

7852.48 --> 7857.678999999999
blah blah blah blah blah oh wow they got

7854.96 --> 7861.119
an actual picture of cows

7857.679 --> 7863.04
just a picture of cows that's it oh

7861.119 --> 7866.04
that's the proof then that it's really

7863.04 --> 7866.04
real

7871.52 --> 7875.52
cows died of extreme heat

7874.639 --> 7877.4400000000005
no

7875.52 --> 7880.079000000001
no they die of dehydration because

7877.44 --> 7883.04
they're just not getting enough water

7880.079 --> 7885.599
if that even is real so this is all just

7883.04 --> 7887.76
blah blah blah blah blah

7885.599 --> 7890.2390000000005
i don't see any actual evidence that

7887.76 --> 7892.13
anything about that is real seems like a

7890.239 --> 7895.3099999999995
speaking point

7892.13 --> 7895.31
[Music]

7903.679 --> 7907.4400000000005
all right seems really strange if it's

7905.44 --> 7909.119
true well that's why i'm already

7907.44 --> 7912.638999999999
deciphering it right in front of you

7909.119 --> 7914.88
it's like no this is probably fake

7912.639 --> 7918.079
i'd say there's more than a 50 chance

7914.88 --> 7918.079
that it's completely fake

7918.32 --> 7922.5599999999995
because of the reasons i mentioned

7922.88 --> 7926.32
i mean

7923.76 --> 7929.599
if they freaking fake school shootings

7926.32 --> 7931.759999999999
that become like international news

7929.599 --> 7934.2390000000005
you think that they wouldn't fake this

7931.76 --> 7936.8
they're literally not even showing you

7934.239 --> 7936.799999999999
pictures

7937.28 --> 7940.8
like

7938.159 --> 7943.199
where is the evidence that they say it

7940.8 --> 7945.1990000000005
happened that's the evidence now no it's

7943.199 --> 7947.44
a speaking point that's not evidence

7945.199 --> 7948.638999999999
it's just somebody blabbering on like it

7947.44 --> 7952.598999999999
happened

7948.639 --> 7952.599
that doesn't prove anything

7960.48 --> 7966.879999999999
right the tic tac video yeah

7964.639 --> 7970.8
you know that this is one tick tock

7966.88 --> 7970.8
video it's one video

7970.88 --> 7977.119
like this video can literally be

7974.88 --> 7977.119
from

7977.44 --> 7983.638999999999
five years ago

7980.0 --> 7983.639
how would you know

7987.679 --> 7991.119
this is just this one video

7992.719 --> 7999.44
i've seen this video like last year

7997.679 --> 8001.84
so you don't know what even happened

7999.44 --> 8005.119
here this could even be just a complete

8001.84 --> 8005.119000000001
[ __ ] cover story

8005.199 --> 8010.079
autopsy is pending

8007.119 --> 8012.48
oh [ __ ]

8010.079 --> 8012.48
it was

8014.0 --> 8018.48
it was last year as well

8016.079 --> 8021.04
so yeah that's not convincing at all

8018.48 --> 8023.598999999999
it's just a video with that cows so that

8021.04 --> 8024.96
means that that is the dead couch from

8023.599 --> 8026.8
the article

8024.96 --> 8029.44
from kansas from

8026.8 --> 8032.079000000001
from allegedly just happened or is it

8029.44 --> 8035.44
just another video

8032.079 --> 8038.0
from years ago of when actually a lot of

8035.44 --> 8040.5599999999995
cattle died for some reason maybe their

8038.0 --> 8042.159
food was bad or something at the time

8040.56 --> 8045.599
and now they're just gonna

8042.159 --> 8047.759999999999
dig that clip up every time they need a

8045.599 --> 8050.88
story about oh they died because of

8047.76 --> 8053.04
climate change or blood disease

8050.88 --> 8055.04
and they'll just dig up the same footage

8053.04 --> 8056.239
yeah that sort of [ __ ]

8055.04 --> 8058.719
happens

8056.239 --> 8061.04
with a lot of different type of stories

8058.719 --> 8062.159
yeah it also happens with migrant

8061.04 --> 8064.96
attacks

8062.159 --> 8067.5199999999995
some really brutal migrant attacks

8064.96 --> 8069.199
in europe on video yeah

8067.52 --> 8071.76
and then they say oh look this just

8069.199 --> 8074.638999999999
happened oh yeah yeah sure yeah that

8071.76 --> 8077.119000000001
just happened from that video from 10

8074.639 --> 8079.36
years ago that i recognized yes yeah

8077.119 --> 8082.04
that just happened yes

8079.36 --> 8084.48
sure it's not like you're just trying to

8082.04 --> 8088.0
propaganize us

8084.48 --> 8090.48
so sewing aggravation get people rile up

8088.0 --> 8092.88
for something again programming yeah by

8090.48 --> 8095.04
recycling old footage

8092.88 --> 8095.92
like i never seen that before

8095.04 --> 8098.88
yeah

8095.92 --> 8102.8
this is what happens people this is what

8098.88 --> 8105.4400000000005
happens with media they recycle old [ __ ]

8102.8 --> 8107.679
put a new print on it and then give you

8105.44 --> 8108.638999999999
something to squirt over

8107.679 --> 8111.679
that's

8108.639 --> 8114.4800000000005
media now that's the news

8111.679 --> 8115.76
blah blah blah [ __ ] no proof be

8114.48 --> 8118.959999999999
afraid

8115.76 --> 8118.96
that's the news now

8119.04 --> 8124.4
or actually it was always the news it's

8121.04 --> 8125.92
just like everywhere now

8124.4 --> 8130.29
it's even worse it's even more

8125.92 --> 8135.359
standardized in its deception systems

8130.29 --> 8135.359
[Music]

8152.0 --> 8155.28
that's right they will not just suddenly

8153.44 --> 8156.96
drop dead

8155.28 --> 8159.28
well not unless they just suddenly

8156.96 --> 8161.28
didn't get any drink anymore right if

8159.28 --> 8163.04
the water ran out because it was cut off

8161.28 --> 8166.719
or something yeah that's just gonna kill

8163.04 --> 8166.719
them pretty much in a day

8166.96 --> 8170.96
i mean if it's hot they need water they

8169.44 --> 8173.5199999999995
will need water if they don't get it

8170.96 --> 8175.119
yeah then they die very quickly it's not

8173.52 --> 8177.040000000001
because it's hot it's because they

8175.119 --> 8180.239
didn't get the water that they normally

8177.04 --> 8180.239
need when it's just hot

8180.32 --> 8182.5599999999995
so

8181.199 --> 8185.759999999999
you don't know what happened you don't

8182.56 --> 8189.92
know if anything happened if it's just a

8185.76 --> 8189.92
completely fabricated ruse

8190.56 --> 8193.84
you don't know

8194.08 --> 8201.92
unless you literally go there

8197.519 --> 8206.599
and you check out the bodies yourself

8201.92 --> 8206.599
like where are they where's the corpses

8217.28 --> 8221.04
yeah don't worry i know you're not

8219.12 --> 8223.28
spiraling i'm just trying to make a

8221.04 --> 8225.679
point out of this it's like i

8223.28 --> 8229.76
these types of stories

8225.679 --> 8233.04
that's the new news right you're echoing

8229.76 --> 8235.04
the news like remember say 20 years ago

8233.04 --> 8238.639000000001
all of you would have done exactly the

8235.04 --> 8241.679
same type of thing with the regular news

8238.639 --> 8243.199999999999
on the television oh look this just

8241.679 --> 8245.599
happened right

8243.2 --> 8246.880000000001
oh really what's your evidence oh you

8245.599 --> 8249.359
saw a video

8246.88 --> 8251.92
oh you didn't recognize that video from

8249.359 --> 8253.599
10 years ago oh yeah

8251.92 --> 8256.16
yeah then you believed it didn't you

8253.599 --> 8260.08
yeah that's why they do it that's how we

8256.16 --> 8260.08
do it then and that's how they do it now

8261.92 --> 8268.319
only now it's not through the television

8264.319 --> 8271.76
it's through all other type of news

8268.319 --> 8276.76
on the internet it's the same but worse

8271.76 --> 8276.76
more spread out more systematic

8281.84 --> 8285.519
it's extreme levels no it's

8284.24 --> 8287.679
it's not

8285.519 --> 8291.2
it's the same levels

8287.679 --> 8294.399
it's just more of it and you see

8291.2 --> 8297.04
more of how it is fake

8294.399 --> 8298.719
but that same procedure shoving scary

8297.04 --> 8300.880000000001
[ __ ] in your face oh look it's all died

8298.719 --> 8302.399
oh look at all these oh no so many

8300.88 --> 8304.639
chickens have been killed because of an

8302.399 --> 8308.319
alleged stupid disease that we have no

8304.639 --> 8309.358999999999
proof of it's probably not even possible

8308.319 --> 8313.599
yes

8309.359 --> 8313.599
how do you know that actually happen

8313.76 --> 8317.599
how do you know that the farmer didn't

8315.76 --> 8321.599
just make a deal

8317.599 --> 8322.479
like oh if you oh we want to buy you out

8321.599 --> 8324.719000000001
yeah

8322.479 --> 8327.119999999999
you can get rid of these animals well

8324.719 --> 8328.88
what if we just kill them and then tell

8327.12 --> 8331.679
everybody they got a disease and then

8328.88 --> 8333.679
you can get extra attention and

8331.679 --> 8338.639
you get sponsored by the pharmaceutical

8333.679 --> 8339.439
industry that want to play out this [ __ ]

8338.639 --> 8345.319
yeah

8339.439 --> 8345.319
that's probably what really happens

8353.04 --> 8356.229000000001
[Music]

8359.92 --> 8364.08
it could be completely fabricated like

8362.0 --> 8366.24
the radius yeah good point

8364.08 --> 8367.439
right anyway i'm gonna round out the

8366.24 --> 8369.359
show

8367.439 --> 8372.880000000001
it's been going for

8369.359 --> 8374.880000000001
two hours seventeen minutes

8372.88 --> 8376.719
ah and then it's gonna be back to early

8374.88 --> 8379.039999999999
show again tomorrow i really hope the

8376.719 --> 8381.279999999999
heat dies down a little because

8379.04 --> 8383.28
i don't yeah if tomorrow's gonna be just

8381.28 --> 8386.559000000001
like this then i'll probably start an

8383.28 --> 8386.559000000001
hour late guys because

8386.639 --> 8391.358999999999
it was just too hot before before two

8388.96 --> 8391.358999999999
o'clock

8391.84 --> 8395.439
right

8393.359 --> 8397.6
so any anymore for any more any more

8395.439 --> 8399.359
points

8397.6 --> 8402.479000000001
anything you would like to make me

8399.359 --> 8404.640000000001
address i mean i i could technically

8402.479 --> 8405.84
technically guys i could go for another

8404.64 --> 8408.72
two hours

8405.84 --> 8412.84
be hungry two hours but i could do that

8408.72 --> 8412.84
if the input was good

8418.16 --> 8421.92
let's introduce some new boyfriend right

8420.16 --> 8424.24
yeah that's right psych bear they'll

8421.92 --> 8426.56
like oh no it's it's an alleged new

8424.24 --> 8428.88
disease oh we're gonna develop a vaccine

8426.56 --> 8430.96
for that disease okay now everybody that

8428.88 --> 8433.358999999999
is that has these animals is going to

8430.96 --> 8435.839999999998
have to take that vaccine oh no no they

8433.359 --> 8438.880000000001
got all that disease oh who could have

8435.84 --> 8441.68
seen that coming it's only the standard

8438.88 --> 8442.96
approach for pharmacy concerning

8441.68 --> 8445.84
vaccines

8442.96 --> 8450.16
that's how they kill everything

8445.84 --> 8451.52
make you believe it then you buy into it

8450.16 --> 8454.319
then you

8451.52 --> 8457.6
kill yourself or your animals or

8454.319 --> 8459.6
whatever they want to have die

8457.6 --> 8460.960000000001
you will do that because you believe

8459.6 --> 8463.84
them

8460.96 --> 8465.358999999999
they make you kill your own things

8463.84 --> 8469.92
it's what they like to do it's

8465.359 --> 8472.479000000001
necromancy these are necromancers

8469.92 --> 8475.52
yeah big pharma necromancer it's

8472.479 --> 8478.479
necromancy they might control you into

8475.52 --> 8481.84
killing yourself that's what they do

8478.479 --> 8485.76
they're satanic evil and they should be

8481.84 --> 8487.2
wiped off the face of the earth entirely

8485.76 --> 8489.52
the entire

8487.2 --> 8491.2
freaking system that

8489.52 --> 8493.960000000001
that whole

8491.2 --> 8495.84
profession range so

8493.96 --> 8498.839999999998
disappear

8495.84 --> 8503.2
entirely

8498.84 --> 8505.04
completely no more vaccines of any sort

8503.2 --> 8508.08
ever again

8505.04 --> 8509.68
yeah you want a vaccine you you freaking

8508.08 --> 8512.479
develop it in your own freaking

8509.68 --> 8513.2
laboratory there will be no agency for

8512.479 --> 8514.88
it

8513.2 --> 8517.52
yeah there will be no worries of

8514.88 --> 8519.519999999999
spreading anything because nothing does

8517.52 --> 8521.439
only thing that spreads disease is

8519.52 --> 8523.28
freaking vaccines

8521.439 --> 8524.880000000001
and just pollution

8523.28 --> 8526.560000000001
that's what actually causes it that's

8524.88 --> 8528.399
what spreads it

8526.56 --> 8529.76
that's how they keep it going

8528.399 --> 8532.319
by making you

8529.76 --> 8534.960000000001
inject yourself with poison so you get

8532.319 --> 8536.479
the disease that the supposed vaccine is

8534.96 --> 8538.24
to help against

8536.479 --> 8540.0
allegedly

8538.24 --> 8542.479
that's what they do that's how they keep

8540.0 --> 8546.319
it going it's a giant necromantic scam

8542.479 --> 8546.319
and it needs to end forever

8546.399 --> 8550.319
you want to inject poison into your body

8548.96 --> 8553.679999999998
go ahead

8550.319 --> 8557.0
no more [ __ ] industry for that [ __ ]

8553.68 --> 8557.0
no more

8558.399 --> 8563.519999999999
it's only killing people

8561.04 --> 8567.359
killing people destroying

8563.52 --> 8569.2
food and creating poison and pollution

8567.359 --> 8570.800000000001
there is no

8569.2 --> 8574.240000000002
benefit

8570.8 --> 8576.72
for humanity to have it around any

8574.24 --> 8576.72
longer

8578.319 --> 8581.319
right

8585.359 --> 8591.52
same symptoms of radiation poisoning

8588.08 --> 8595.6
but well maybe they are using just

8591.52 --> 8595.6
like radiographic weapons

8596.72 --> 8600.96
maybe they're just like directed energy

8598.88 --> 8603.358999999999
weapons maybe they're just like just

8600.96 --> 8606.319
just zapping things to death now could

8603.359 --> 8609.12
be right they could be doing that

8606.319 --> 8611.68
and then saying oh it's a disease

8609.12 --> 8614.240000000002
right so literally just using high-tech

8611.68 --> 8617.92
weapons to just kill off [ __ ]

8614.24 --> 8620.399
just to make more sales

8617.92 --> 8623.28
through necromancy to convince more

8620.399 --> 8624.96
people to kill themselves and kill their

8623.28 --> 8628.880000000001
stock

8624.96 --> 8632.8
that's how they do it it is super evil

8628.88 --> 8634.479
it is irredeemably evil

8632.8 --> 8636.279999999999
and it should be

8634.479 --> 8640.92
made forbidden

8636.28 --> 8640.92
internationally and permanently

8642.88 --> 8650.24
yeah it should be illegal to advertise

8646.479 --> 8652.88
and sell and even claim [ __ ] viruses

8650.24 --> 8654.479
exist how about that how about making it

8652.88 --> 8656.0
illegal

8654.479 --> 8658.399
to claim

8656.0 --> 8662.16
viruses exist

8658.399 --> 8662.16
yeah because they don't

8662.24 --> 8665.64
make it illegal

8671.92 --> 8678.84
there is no scientific evidence so make

8675.439 --> 8678.84
it illegal

8679.439 --> 8682.439
done

8689.359 --> 8696.0
is it true no no steamy traveler that's

8691.76 --> 8697.6
not true that's ridiculous

8696.0 --> 8699.76
they're gonna poison the well then

8697.6 --> 8701.439
they're just gonna poison the well they

8699.76 --> 8704.24
might poison the well they might just

8701.439 --> 8706.319
literally destroy all water supplies

8704.24 --> 8709.119999999999
under the guise of supposed vaccination

8706.319 --> 8712.399
but it would effectively just be

8709.12 --> 8713.439
destroying the water supply in america

8712.399 --> 8716.319
sure

8713.439 --> 8719.92
do in america they'll do anything in my

8716.319 --> 8722.319
opinion i'm i'm surprised there is even

8719.92 --> 8724.56
unpoisoned land and water still out

8722.319 --> 8728.08
there i mean i don't understand why it's

8724.56 --> 8730.319
just not completely a desert wasteland

8728.08 --> 8731.52
of death and poison yet i don't

8730.319 --> 8733.359
understand

8731.52 --> 8734.800000000001
because they could and they would

8733.359 --> 8736.800000000001
they're

8734.8 --> 8738.88
so either there's nothing actually

8736.8 --> 8742.0
happening it's just a pure bluff just

8738.88 --> 8744.88
make people squirt probably

8742.0 --> 8746.319
or if that's real where's the [ __ ]

8744.88 --> 8748.24
evidence then

8746.319 --> 8750.8
where is the [ __ ] evidence that

8748.24 --> 8753.76
that's even real where is it where's the

8750.8 --> 8757.679999999998
evidence why are you repeating something

8753.76 --> 8760.08
without having confirmed evidence to

8757.68 --> 8762.960000000001
back up the assertion

8760.08 --> 8765.68
instead of more [ __ ] fear porn

8762.96 --> 8768.72
articles without confirmation

8765.68 --> 8768.720000000001
steamy traveler

8769.2 --> 8775.28
why even bring it up

8771.439 --> 8775.28
if you don't have actual evidence

8776.319 --> 8783.279999999999
it's just a speaking point it's just

8778.72 --> 8783.279999999999
fear porn then if you have no evidence

8784.72 --> 8788.88
yeah it's just as much fear porn as oh

8787.12 --> 8790.640000000001
they're spraying the skies with poison

8788.88 --> 8793.599999999999
oh really where's the [ __ ] evidence

8790.64 --> 8796.8
then oh you had you had a ground sample

8793.6 --> 8798.0
20 years ago oh yeah that proves

8796.8 --> 8800.88
everything

8798.0 --> 8800.88
no it doesn't

8801.12 --> 8805.04
if that's happening it should be

8803.28 --> 8806.560000000001
measurable

8805.04 --> 8809.2
constantly

8806.56 --> 8810.319
and persistently you should have entire

8809.2 --> 8813.76
graphs

8810.319 --> 8817.119999999999
of material toxic material build up over

8813.76 --> 8819.68
the decades where is it there is no such

8817.12 --> 8822.560000000001
[ __ ] data there never has been

8819.68 --> 8824.800000000001
because it's just fear porn yeah

8822.56 --> 8826.0
somebody sprayed that [ __ ] sometime

8824.8 --> 8829.119999999999
maybe

8826.0 --> 8830.8
maybe they actually did it one time yeah

8829.12 --> 8832.399000000001
or maybe there's an entire region where

8830.8 --> 8834.8
they constantly doing and everything is

8832.399 --> 8836.479
dying i don't know i'm not seeing it

8834.8 --> 8838.88
happen

8836.479 --> 8841.519999999999
some places seem to have like

8838.88 --> 8843.599999999999
really gross [ __ ] sprayed over them

8841.52 --> 8844.880000000001
does that mean that all chemtrails are

8843.6 --> 8847.52
poisonous

8844.88 --> 8850.72
no because there would be physical

8847.52 --> 8853.04
evidence to back it it would not be

8850.72 --> 8856.24
difficult to achieve that

8853.04 --> 8856.240000000002
yet there isn't

8856.72 --> 8860.64
it's the same for all they're gonna

8858.64 --> 8863.279999999999
poison the water supply oh they're gonna

8860.64 --> 8867.039999999999
put vaccines on it dude

8863.28 --> 8868.479000000001
just made up crap to make you [ __ ] your

8867.04 --> 8871.68
pants

8868.479 --> 8875.08
made up crap to make you [ __ ] your pants

8871.68 --> 8875.08
that's all

8881.28 --> 8885.439
see and that piece of [ __ ] knows it he

8883.92 --> 8887.84
knows i'm right

8885.439 --> 8889.28
because he's a [ __ ] little demon

8887.84 --> 8890.960000000001
he knows i'm right that's why i'm

8889.28 --> 8893.84
speaking up right now to say that

8890.96 --> 8895.599999999999
because he knows i'm right he's a

8893.84 --> 8898.08
[ __ ] little demon

8895.6 --> 8900.319
they can't handle the truth any level of

8898.08 --> 8903.12
truth they can't handle anything that's

8900.319 --> 8906.0
true that's why they speak up right when

8903.12 --> 8907.52
i'm right because they can't handle that

8906.0 --> 8910.56
truth

8907.52 --> 8914.6
i know how this works piece of [ __ ]

8910.56 --> 8914.6
now how you work demon

8921.04 --> 8924.160000000002
that's right psych bear

8925.439 --> 8929.359
around death tower yeah there's evidence

8927.68 --> 8931.68
for that

8929.359 --> 8933.359
right radio towers yeah terrible

8931.68 --> 8935.92
influence there where's the panic

8933.359 --> 8937.84
articles about that oh there aren't any

8935.92 --> 8940.24
yeah because that's not what they want

8937.84 --> 8943.76
you to squirt over

8940.24 --> 8947.76
they want you to squirt over things

8943.76 --> 8950.319
so that you'll sell that to them for

8947.76 --> 8955.2
pennies on the dollar that's the trick

8950.319 --> 8957.119999999999
it's that rudimentary basic [ __ ]

8955.2 --> 8959.84
fearport oh no

8957.12 --> 8961.359
scary here please sell it real i'll sell

8959.84 --> 8963.12
it really cheap

8961.359 --> 8965.12
that's what they want that's why they do

8963.12 --> 8967.6
it because it's pathetic and they're

8965.12 --> 8969.2
just making people squirt

8967.6 --> 8971.84
to rob them

8969.2 --> 8973.359
through their own retardation

8971.84 --> 8976.52
that's what they want to do that's what

8973.359 --> 8976.52
they do

8978.96 --> 8981.279999999999
right

8983.12 --> 8987.84
right i mean why would they make

8985.52 --> 8989.28
fairport articles about death towers

8987.84 --> 8991.439
about

8989.28 --> 8992.880000000001
cell phone towers killing animals and

8991.439 --> 8995.92
plant life

8992.88 --> 8999.358999999999
what they need the cell

8995.92 --> 9002.88
tower owner to sell it cheap to them

8999.359 --> 9006.0
because they might be afraid that oh no

9002.88 --> 9006.96
i might get damages or something

9006.0 --> 9010.0
no

9006.96 --> 9011.358999999999
that's them it's the same [ __ ] group

9010.0 --> 9013.439
of owners

9011.359 --> 9016.56
it's the same group why would they do

9013.439 --> 9019.12
that to their group no they don't do

9016.56 --> 9020.8
that to their group they do it to

9019.12 --> 9023.6
farmers

9020.8 --> 9025.519999999999
and to the general public which is not

9023.6 --> 9027.92
their group

9025.52 --> 9029.52
those people

9027.92 --> 9031.76
they want to

9029.52 --> 9034.399000000001
extinguish what they have

9031.76 --> 9037.52
so they give them fear porn in the hopes

9034.399 --> 9039.199999999999
that they'll panic and sell out cheap

9037.52 --> 9041.28
then they might buy it up or they'll

9039.2 --> 9042.960000000001
just have it all destroyed

9041.28 --> 9046.24
that's why they do it that's why they

9042.96 --> 9049.039999999999
target those groups and not cell phone

9046.24 --> 9051.359
tower owners because they are the

9049.04 --> 9053.439
[ __ ] owners of them so why would they

9051.359 --> 9058.12
do that to themselves when it's

9053.439 --> 9058.12
obviously a destroyer of life

9068.399 --> 9073.358999999999
why do the controls get most of their

9070.08 --> 9076.479
food from from farmers

9073.359 --> 9078.800000000001
but mostly their own i mean

9076.479 --> 9080.88
the controllers is not even a real thing

9078.8 --> 9083.279999999999
this is all just organizations

9080.88 --> 9085.039999999999
conspiring satanic organizations that

9083.28 --> 9087.84
are just we rule everybody and we'll

9085.04 --> 9089.04
kill everybody to keep control no matter

9087.84 --> 9091.68
the cost

9089.04 --> 9094.0
it's just that's not a

9091.68 --> 9095.2
a class

9094.0 --> 9097.439
not really

9095.2 --> 9100.08
but the people that are really insanely

9097.439 --> 9102.479000000001
rich that are actively planning to

9100.08 --> 9105.12
destroy society they have their own

9102.479 --> 9106.88
gardens they have their own private

9105.12 --> 9108.720000000001
farmers guys

9106.88 --> 9109.759999999998
they have their own ranches with their

9108.72 --> 9112.8
own

9109.76 --> 9115.359
farmers that they literally pay to farm

9112.8 --> 9117.279999999999
exclusively for them

9115.359 --> 9119.439
everything they need that's how they do

9117.28 --> 9120.800000000001
it

9119.439 --> 9122.399
because they got all the money in the

9120.8 --> 9125.679999999998
world

9122.399 --> 9128.8
just get their own private farmers that

9125.68 --> 9130.800000000001
only make food for them

9128.8 --> 9133.519999999999
that's how they do it yeah and that's

9130.8 --> 9137.039999999999
why they can just say all the shitty

9133.52 --> 9140.319000000001
things all the diseases is all [ __ ]

9137.04 --> 9141.68
[ __ ] there is no [ __ ] disease

9140.319 --> 9143.76
[ __ ] like that

9141.68 --> 9146.720000000001
is no virus

9143.76 --> 9149.76
doesn't exist it's all just conditions

9146.72 --> 9151.599999999999
conditions of the animal

9149.76 --> 9154.319
if you don't take really good care of

9151.6 --> 9156.56
your animals or there's demoralization

9154.319 --> 9160.319
of any sort yeah they're gonna get

9156.56 --> 9160.319
issues they might get sick

9160.8 --> 9165.438999999998
it's not a [ __ ] virus because those

9164.0 --> 9168.08
don't exist

9165.439 --> 9171.439
it's a presuppositional model that has

9168.08 --> 9172.8
never been proven scientifically ever in

9171.439 --> 9174.960000000001
history

9172.8 --> 9179.519999999999
it doesn't exist it should not be

9174.96 --> 9179.519999999999
allowed to be claimed

9180.08 --> 9186.399
should be forbidden to claim virus as a

9184.0 --> 9190.399
cause of anything

9186.399 --> 9190.399
because viruses don't exist

9193.2 --> 9198.240000000002
right

9195.2 --> 9199.439
anyway oh two and a half hours i'm gonna
