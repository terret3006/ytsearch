98.46 --> 103.63999999999999
oh

99.9 --> 103.64
whether today is

103.68 --> 107.54
not exactly thrilling

110.34 --> 115.86
is just this giant gray soup I can

113.759 --> 120.07900000000001
literally see

115.86 --> 122.96
Cloud shapes just rushing by up there so

120.079 --> 126.05999999999999
whatever's going on

122.96 --> 127.13999999999999
it's it's pretty much Restless up there

126.06 --> 129.06
I think

127.14 --> 133.379
and there's

129.06 --> 136.739
on and off just this micro droplet

133.379 --> 140.84
rain falling out of it

136.739 --> 140.84
so it's just kind of gray and dreary

155.94 --> 158.12
foreign

158.76 --> 164.38
[Music]

164.72 --> 170.16
first in chat good to see you at least

168.3 --> 173.4
LSG

170.16 --> 176.04
PJ Cru Shank

173.4 --> 180.59900000000002
all right good to see you all

176.04 --> 183.12
it is Saturday the up 15th of October

180.599 --> 184.79999999999998
2022

183.12 --> 186.78
whether it's the same over there all

184.8 --> 188.519
right right

186.78 --> 193.26
yeah

188.519 --> 195.3
it's like I but it it is like mid-autumn

193.26 --> 198.07999999999998
isn't it

195.3 --> 198.08
around now

204.12 --> 210.06
so it should be kind of this weather

206.7 --> 212.35999999999999
not not the most pleasant but hey Rick

210.06 --> 212.36
back

213.18 --> 218.34
good to see you

215.34 --> 221.4
yeah doing well

218.34 --> 223.62
ah although yeah I got

221.4 --> 226.92000000000002
nasty

223.62 --> 230.58
cramped up muscle in my shoulder I think

226.92 --> 233.64
I may have slept like in a slightly

230.58 --> 236.459
abnormal position and then fell asleep

233.64 --> 239.17999999999998
anyway normally I would like realize

236.459 --> 242.7
that and then start to do that but

239.18 --> 244.5
apparently I forgot or something no it's

242.7 --> 247.92
just like

244.5 --> 251.76
but yeah I've been massaging it on and

247.92 --> 255.85999999999999
off and I know it tomorrow it'll be gone

251.76 --> 255.85999999999999
uh but it is kind of annoying

256.32 --> 258.919
ah

262.62 --> 265.94
Mega Autumn right

266.759 --> 269.90000000000003
all right

270.56 --> 275.94
yeah but anyway having using your

273.419 --> 277.85999999999996
shoulder is a lot less annoying

275.94 --> 279.71999999999997
than when you got that sort of [ __ ] in

277.86 --> 282.54
your back

279.72 --> 285.72
right I mean everybody's probably had

282.54 --> 286.639
that once or twice

285.72 --> 288.96000000000004
foreign

286.639 --> 291.3
just sleep in a really weird position

288.96 --> 294.18
and then you wake up and like your back

291.3 --> 295.94
is all locked up now that sucks oh this

294.18 --> 298.32
is not that thank God

295.94 --> 301.199
but it's just

298.32 --> 303.479
it just feels like there's this I don't

301.199 --> 306.479
know this little animal like a weasel or

303.479 --> 309.49
something just constantly chewing down

306.479 --> 312.699
on one muscle

309.49 --> 312.699
[Music]

318.419 --> 323.15999999999997
all right and if you have those types of

320.759 --> 326.34000000000003
issues yourself

323.16 --> 328.86
is it the best solution is to make sure

326.34 --> 331.67999999999995
that there's just a lot of blood flow

328.86 --> 333.96000000000004
because these types of problems arrive

331.68 --> 336.3
when the blood flow somehow is cut off

333.96 --> 339.06
how does that happen through awkward

336.3 --> 341.88
positions during sleeping

339.06 --> 344.759
very just like

341.88 --> 346.5
cramp yourself up but then it's

344.759 --> 348.6
tightened and you stick to that tight

346.5 --> 350.94
thing and that's just not good then

348.6 --> 354.47900000000004
blood can't properly flow to every

350.94 --> 357.36
position to start well

354.479 --> 359.88
cleaning up the

357.36 --> 362.16
well the typical muscle toxins and all

359.88 --> 363.9
that that are heaped up for the day and

362.16 --> 365.22
then it's really going to be busy like

363.9 --> 367.32
well

365.22 --> 370.68
it's like closing the store cleaning the

367.32 --> 373.56
mess up well if it's then just not able

370.68 --> 375.419
to enter then that mess stays there and

373.56 --> 377.52
then you have to certainly function with

375.419 --> 380.94
that mess still there and that's how I

377.52 --> 382.38
basically yeah explain these types of

380.94 --> 385.699
things and this is a very common

382.38 --> 385.699
occurrence for a lot of people

386.639 --> 389.3
right

395.759 --> 401.1
oh yeah yeah no but that's yeah no

398.88 --> 404.4
that's like I think it's like spraining

401.1 --> 408.12
your back that just sucks when you just

404.4 --> 410.039
basically Miss size up how your muscles

408.12 --> 412.88
are going to be able to handle that and

410.039 --> 415.86
then yeah that sucks

412.88 --> 418.8
I've had some of those

415.86 --> 421.199
and really careful now so that doesn't

418.8 --> 423.919
happen but things like this still do

421.199 --> 423.91900000000004
happen to me

429.06 --> 433.139
anyway

430.56 --> 436.88
it does suck yeah yeah

433.139 --> 436.88
hello Thor Casey

440.099 --> 445.38
right I hope anybody else here is not

442.86 --> 446.52000000000004
currently having a similar problem if

445.38 --> 449.58
you don't

446.52 --> 452.21999999999997
well be careful I think this is

449.58 --> 454.81899999999996
typically the season for that

452.22 --> 454.819
you know

457.44 --> 462.979
or maybe with some people when people

459.3 --> 462.979
winter but you just got to be careful

465.12 --> 469.68
and then nothing happens but you'll

466.979 --> 473.099
still have the tension right because it

469.68 --> 475.8
is usually like tension

473.099 --> 477.479
that makes you do that that makes you

475.8 --> 480.419
kind of like

477.479 --> 482.699
fall sleep at an awkward position so you

480.419 --> 484.56
don't have to feel something specific so

482.699 --> 486.72
it doesn't distract you you can focus on

484.56 --> 490.22
sleeping but by doing that often it then

486.72 --> 490.22
creates these types of problems

492.96 --> 498.12
right and even if you avoid

496.08 --> 499.62
doing that and you don't have the

498.12 --> 501.539
problems you will still have that

499.62 --> 504.66
tension I mean that's basically the

501.539 --> 507.84
thing right the tension

504.66 --> 510.41900000000004
some some people it expresses it even

507.84 --> 513.139
itself as like Melancholy or even

510.419 --> 513.139
depression

514.44 --> 520.7600000000001
but that's not always where it has to

517.979 --> 520.76
lead though

522.65 --> 528.74
[Music]

524.82 --> 528.74
you just have to be a little tighter

530.339 --> 535.82
anyway

532.14 --> 535.8199999999999
hey Susie asks good to see you

540.72 --> 545.1600000000001
yeah that was a weird video you linked

542.76 --> 546.779
me up with over email I still appreciate

545.16 --> 549.3
it though

546.779 --> 550.74
but yeah when I heard like oh this guy

549.3 --> 553.14
mentioned something about the

550.74 --> 554.4590000000001
holographic celestials I was like oh oh

553.14 --> 556.4399999999999
that's cool

554.459 --> 558.4799999999999
but then I actually watched the video

556.44 --> 561.2
and

558.48 --> 561.2
I mean

561.24 --> 568.38
I don't know if he's doing it on purpose

563.64 --> 571.1
but it was completely incoherent

568.38 --> 571.1
I mean

572.339 --> 577.6800000000001
it was it sounded somewhat in it seems

575.88 --> 580.2
like he had grabbed a whole bunch of

577.68 --> 583.56
information from places it's just the

580.2 --> 586.38
way he put it together was not coherent

583.56 --> 589.76
it I would say like

586.38 --> 589.76
slightly psychotic

592.44 --> 596.5400000000001
not emotionally disturbed or anything

594.48 --> 600.32
but just like

596.54 --> 602.519
it just didn't make real sense

600.32 --> 604.44
that was weird

602.519 --> 606.36
but yeah I always appreciate it if

604.44 --> 608.5400000000001
people want me to take a look at

606.36 --> 608.54
something

609.36 --> 614.58
right and if you thought for some reason

612.12 --> 617.4590000000001
it was really amazing

614.58 --> 621.8000000000001
and then I suddenly respond like ah this

617.459 --> 621.8
is trash then don't take that personal

622.32 --> 629.279
I'll probably I'll probably have looked

625.26 --> 634.459
at another aspect of it than what made

629.279 --> 634.459
you like it that's usually how that goes

637.44 --> 641.49
right

638.37 --> 641.49
[Music]

646.019 --> 651.0600000000001
it's like his mind is going 100 miles an

648.48 --> 652.9200000000001
hour yeah but there's no touchdown

651.06 --> 656.1199999999999
so it's just wildly spinning out of

652.92 --> 656.12
control there's no touchdown

656.459 --> 662.2199999999999
no actual distance is being made it's

659.88 --> 664.76
just spinning wildly in out of control

662.22 --> 664.76
in position

669.839 --> 675.36
all right if your mind can actually

671.88 --> 678.36
touch down and properly translate what

675.36 --> 683.36
you are seeing then what's the point it

678.36 --> 683.36
just becomes a wild incoherent story

684.48 --> 690.0600000000001
right by the way yeah you can link up

687.0 --> 691.92
that video by the way

690.06 --> 694.8
here

691.92 --> 697.079
so it's yes you got the wrench

694.8 --> 700.279
right I mean we're I'm sort of talking

697.079 --> 700.279
about it now so

701.88 --> 707.04
what's what is his name

703.74 --> 710.5790000000001
uh Flat Earth philosophy

707.04 --> 715.459
I don't know if anybody else here in the

710.579 --> 715.459
in the chat has heard about him

724.38 --> 727.38
foreign

735.56 --> 741.779
oh oh really

738.18 --> 744.0
oh goody if you just seen it because I'm

741.779 --> 747.32
used to kind of feeling that pretty much

744.0 --> 747.32
since I was 12.

747.66 --> 752.899
now of course the nature of it is

750.3 --> 752.899
changing around

753.48 --> 759.4200000000001
but yeah

756.839 --> 761.1
certainly hope in my 50s is not going to

759.42 --> 762.8389999999999
get a lot worse because then I might

761.1 --> 764.7
lose cohesion it's

762.839 --> 767.24
it's pretty tough

764.7 --> 767.24
already

768.12 --> 772.1
right ah thanks Susie

787.079 --> 792.92
foreign

788.42 --> 792.92
but the thing is you know I think

793.8 --> 801.4799999999999
I think he's trying to perhaps

797.22 --> 802.6800000000001
sort of do he showed the same way that I

801.48 --> 806.16
do it

802.68 --> 807.3599999999999
he's all very hand descriptive and all

806.16 --> 811.62
that

807.36 --> 813.74
but the actual story cohesion itself you

811.62 --> 813.74
know

814.079 --> 818.2199999999999
that's the problem

815.7 --> 821.519
I mean whenever I do things and then I

818.22 --> 824.279
try to get visual that's all secondary

821.519 --> 826.8
to the actual idea that I'm carrying in

824.279 --> 829.079
my mind which is cohesive because I work

826.8 --> 831.8
on that

829.079 --> 831.8
a lot

833.12 --> 838.339
prioritize the cohesion over my own

836.459 --> 842.06
short-term

838.339 --> 842.0600000000001
contemporary interests

848.399 --> 850.639
foreign

858.12 --> 861.12
distracting

862.59 --> 874.65
[Music]

875.519 --> 879.2
wow okay

880.139 --> 884.88
it was certainly not in a hurry driving

882.899 --> 888.32
extremely slow

884.88 --> 888.32
whatever hmm

898.92 --> 907.2199999999999
what video crochet

902.1 --> 907.22
you shared me with her wow okay

927.5 --> 933.839
let's go that does seem hilarious though

931.38 --> 935.699
but I don't know what part did you share

933.839 --> 938.6990000000001
I mean

935.699 --> 938.699
uh

941.519 --> 946.8
you know

943.199 --> 949.8
I am quite over the place so

946.8 --> 954.019
now that was fire

949.8 --> 954.019
it was a fire truck video krishang

958.74 --> 963.87
foreign

960.66 --> 963.87
[Music]

973.639 --> 979.32
we still kind of use the old sounds and

977.22 --> 981.9590000000001
I'm glad of it because those new

979.32 --> 984.6
upgraded sounds suck they're super

981.959 --> 986.2199999999999
invasive they break your focus

984.6 --> 989.339
everything

986.22 --> 992.76
I hate the modern Sirens Terrible Things

989.339 --> 995.639
the old ones are fine and everybody is

992.76 --> 998.16
like conditioned to to basically know

995.639 --> 999.66
how to deal with that here

998.16 --> 1003.74
so

999.66 --> 1006.8199999999999
I'm glad I didn't upgrade

1003.74 --> 1006.82
that would suck

1036.98 --> 1045.699
no but for Casey it's not just getting

1039.62 --> 1045.6989999999998
your attention that sound is painful

1046.459 --> 1050.54
like these regular Sirens are they get

1049.22 --> 1053.9
your attention

1050.54 --> 1056.84
the modern ones are just painful

1053.9 --> 1059.7800000000002
I mean I have to flee the scene if

1056.84 --> 1062.299
sirens are like staying there the modern

1059.78 --> 1064.8799999999999
ones because it's just painful it

1062.299 --> 1068.059
physically hurts me those types of

1064.88 --> 1070.7600000000002
sounds these Sirens not so much they're

1068.059 --> 1072.2
just really loud that's all right if I

1070.76 --> 1074.24
just cover my ears there's no problem

1072.2 --> 1076.5800000000002
with the other Sirens they go right

1074.24 --> 1079.1
through everything including your hands

1076.58 --> 1082.48
in front of your ears

1079.1 --> 1082.48
hate those sounds

1082.84 --> 1096.6789999999999
[Music]

1094.7 --> 1100.16
I couldn't get your attention oh yes

1096.679 --> 1102.44
because that's what you want pain

1100.16 --> 1105.8600000000001
it's like Rescue Services you want that

1102.44 --> 1109.9
you want pain great

we're talking about Susie yes

video krishek

1175.46 --> 1178.3400000000001
yeah

1176.14 --> 1180.44
the old ones work because they're

1178.34 --> 1182.84
accustomed to it that also means we can

1180.44 --> 1186.039
tune out oh no

how dare you

1186.23 --> 1190.46
[Music]

1187.64 --> 1194.0590000000002
isn't the whole point that it's just

1190.46 --> 1196.64
you're able to pick up like oh it's that

1194.059 --> 1198.3799999999999
what what you have to then drop

1196.64 --> 1200.3600000000001
everything you're doing even if you're

1198.38 --> 1202.64
in the middle of a meeting in your

1200.36 --> 1204.4399999999998
building or something you just have to

1202.64 --> 1206.419
drop everything because the freaking

1204.44 --> 1207.74
siren and you have to come out and do

1206.419 --> 1209.2990000000002
something right no

1207.74 --> 1211.64
[Music]

1209.299 --> 1213.44
it's good that if you're able to block

1211.64 --> 1215.98
it out of your mind it's all about the

1213.44 --> 1215.98
recognition

1216.14 --> 1220.1000000000001
that you can hear it

1218.66 --> 1223.419
and then

1220.1 --> 1227.299
either if you're involved in such things

1223.419 --> 1229.66
respond or blot it out and continue with

brain can't filter it up yeah then that

1248.96 --> 1253.039
means oh the police show up well that

1250.82 --> 1254.6599999999999
means that just every everybody's

1253.039 --> 1256.76
concentration is going to be a ruined

1254.66 --> 1259.1000000000001
then it's just gonna

1256.76 --> 1261.2
everybody's going to be super distracted

1259.1 --> 1262.8999999999999
broken out of whatever they were doing

1261.2 --> 1265.7
and then

1262.9 --> 1269.14
whatever happens right what's the point

1265.7 --> 1272.3590000000002
of that that's a disruptive influence

just

1293.78 --> 1296.78
downgraded

1299.9 --> 1304.7
let's just turn it back to the old

1301.94 --> 1307.3400000000001
system I mean you don't need Super in

1304.7 --> 1311.0
what what oh you need to make sure that

1307.34 --> 1313.3999999999999
the ambulance will be hurt through a

1311.0 --> 1314.96
giant concrete wall oh that's so

1313.4 --> 1316.52
important man

1314.96 --> 1318.98
why

1316.52 --> 1322.299
this is like a regular service thing

1318.98 --> 1326.24
it's gonna move past houses all the time

1322.299 --> 1329.4189999999999
wouldn't you want it to not disturb

1326.24 --> 1332.419
everybody constantly

1329.419 --> 1334.7800000000002
this is all just pragmatic here I don't

1332.419 --> 1334.7800000000002
get it

1340.47 --> 1343.68
[Music]

1345.679 --> 1350.26
right did you see that

1354.62 --> 1359.78
right and hey as me being on the bike or

1358.1 --> 1362.12
whatever or even when I was still

1359.78 --> 1365.8999999999999
driving cars

1362.12 --> 1369.26
I could tear like an ambulance or a

1365.9 --> 1372.6200000000001
police car siren perfectly fine

1369.26 --> 1375.08
and was very easy for me to also just

1372.62 --> 1377.4189999999999
figure out where it's coming from

1375.08 --> 1380.4189999999999
right you could just hear it very easily

1377.419 --> 1382.539
it's not like a weird holographic sound

1380.419 --> 1385.76
effect like

1382.539 --> 1388.1
non-local sound weird effects

1385.76 --> 1390.3799999999999
right just to get your attention using

1388.1 --> 1392.4189999999999
like what I would call Bose technology

1390.38 --> 1395.419
it's they're just a company that used

1392.419 --> 1396.74
that really the speakers

1395.419 --> 1400.3600000000001
but

1396.74 --> 1400.36
yeah Advanced sound

1400.659 --> 1406.4
Holograms sonograms yeah Advanced

1404.299 --> 1408.44
sonograms you could call I don't know

1406.4 --> 1411.02
sonogram is a medical terminology I

1408.44 --> 1414.38
don't know what to call it but you don't

1411.02 --> 1416.78
need that for freaking sirens

1414.38 --> 1419.24
I mean oh yo you could need that for

1416.78 --> 1421.7
Sirens If you literally want to make

1419.24 --> 1423.38
everybody go insane or scared or

1421.7 --> 1426.14
whatever if you're just gonna use it as

1423.38 --> 1428.72
a psychological warfare device

1426.14 --> 1431.179
but wouldn't that be like

1428.72 --> 1432.559
better designated for like Riot police

1431.179 --> 1435.44
or something you know and they already

1432.559 --> 1439.299
got some of those types of things

1435.44 --> 1442.7
but for regular services

1439.299 --> 1445.28
ambulances police

1442.7 --> 1449.24
fire trucks

1445.28 --> 1453.1
they don't need that [ __ ] it's just

1449.24 --> 1453.1
gonna create more restlessness

1453.82 --> 1458.03
[Music]

1466.64 --> 1471.98
right part of the site yeah but that's

1468.86 --> 1474.08
bad that's counterproductive to the

1471.98 --> 1475.64
service you see Rick back I'm just

1474.08 --> 1477.4399999999998
thinking from a very pragmatic

1475.64 --> 1479.8400000000001
perspective here

1477.44 --> 1481.7
right oh yeah the overarching plan

1479.84 --> 1483.02
there's social engineering us to be

1481.7 --> 1484.7
scared

1483.02 --> 1487.28
yeah but

1484.7 --> 1491.1200000000001
technically these services are

1487.28 --> 1495.08
performing services with a objective and

1491.12 --> 1497.7399999999998
a directive and all that and well such

1495.08 --> 1500.48
an influence would be directly

1497.74 --> 1504.02
detrimental to the quality of their

1500.48 --> 1506.48
service of their influence right

1504.02 --> 1509.26
it's not a good influence so do

1506.48 --> 1509.26
something about it

1512.059 --> 1514.6
right

1514.91 --> 1518.1190000000001
[Music]

1527.659 --> 1531.5
it's so people get yeah but it's no

1530.36 --> 1533.6
question what the [ __ ] are you

1531.5 --> 1536.24
blabbering about idiot

1533.6 --> 1539.84
I already addressed all of that in like

1536.24 --> 1543.559
the last 10 minutes like do these people

1539.84 --> 1546.74
that just watch in here

1543.559 --> 1549.26
they just listen to like two seconds

1546.74 --> 1550.64
and then they think they got it all

1549.26 --> 1554.32
solved even though I've already been

1550.64 --> 1554.3200000000002
discussing this for like 10 minutes

1556.64 --> 1563.48
you don't need the modern

1561.2 --> 1566.799
sonogram

1563.48 --> 1570.559
sound systems for

1566.799 --> 1572.4189999999999
or emergency service Alarm yeah for the

1570.559 --> 1573.62
sirens you don't need that that's

1572.419 --> 1575.8400000000001
ridiculous

1573.62 --> 1577.6999999999998
you can use the old systems perfectly

1575.84 --> 1580.9399999999998
fine

1577.7 --> 1583.76
I mean no accidents happened because

1580.94 --> 1585.919
people didn't hear the sirens coming

1583.76 --> 1588.32
yeah

1585.919 --> 1591.14
just mention

1588.32 --> 1592.82
like some accidents somewhere in like

1591.14 --> 1595.8200000000002
the 20th century right when they didn't

1592.82 --> 1598.9399999999998
have those shitty things yet just name

1595.82 --> 1601.52
me one accident that happened where

1598.94 --> 1604.1000000000001
afterward like the person involved

1601.52 --> 1607.039
mentioned like yeah I just didn't hear

1604.1 --> 1609.1399999999999
the sirens I had no idea

1607.039 --> 1610.64
really

1609.14 --> 1611.5200000000002
[Music]

1610.64 --> 1615.0200000000002
no

1611.52 --> 1617.179
[Music]

1615.02 --> 1620.0
I mean if they say that that would

1617.179 --> 1622.159
probably be a straight-faced lie

1620.0 --> 1624.26
just to get out of responsibility or

1622.159 --> 1626.179
something but it's just not

1624.26 --> 1628.52
realistic

1626.179 --> 1631.46
the old Sirens were perfectly fine

1628.52 --> 1634.8799999999999
that's why they've been using that for a

1631.46 --> 1636.559
very long time like a century I mean

1634.88 --> 1638.3600000000001
sirens

1636.559 --> 1641.779
exists for

1638.36 --> 1645.039
is it since the industrial era so

1641.779 --> 1645.039
this is pointless

1645.5 --> 1649.76
there's no

1647.12 --> 1651.7399999999998
productive long-term reason to have

1649.76 --> 1654.62
upgraded them

1651.74 --> 1659.059
they're now just seek covertly serving

1654.62 --> 1661.1
as a unrest seeding tool

1659.059 --> 1663.3799999999999
because of the before mentioned reasons

1661.1 --> 1665.36
and I wonder if like the police force in

1663.38 --> 1668.419
this forces and all that

1665.36 --> 1670.82
are even fully aware of that and if they

1668.419 --> 1673.9
wouldn't rather just like go back to the

1670.82 --> 1673.8999999999999
old system themselves

1674.059 --> 1679.039
yo sirens

1676.82 --> 1683.4189999999999
I mean I don't know why this has just

1679.039 --> 1687.32
become a subject now but it has this is

1683.419 --> 1689.98
it's because a fire truck drove by now

1687.32 --> 1689.98
it's a subject

1696.02 --> 1700.48
hey Judo

1697.7 --> 1700.48
good to see you

1707.659 --> 1710.2600000000002
foreign

1723.46 --> 1730.46
but I agree with that you see

1727.58 --> 1733.46
I think that the engineers

1730.46 --> 1735.74
were just being perfectionists

1733.46 --> 1738.6200000000001
and it's like oh how do we get more

1735.74 --> 1741.86
effective Sirens oh will you just make

1738.62 --> 1744.3799999999999
sure that nobody can ignore it

1741.86 --> 1748.12
but I think that's like more born from a

1744.38 --> 1753.98
perfectionist process than it was really

1748.12 --> 1753.9799999999998
like oh we gotta ruin the sirens really

1755.179 --> 1762.159
I mean I can't rule that out but that

1758.12 --> 1762.1589999999999
does sound kind of insane

1762.98 --> 1768.039
right

1764.779 --> 1771.559
I can very easily imagine from like a

1768.039 --> 1774.44
non-malevolent perspective like how they

1771.559 --> 1776.96
made those things which is like no more

1774.44 --> 1780.559
effective it's like they made him for

1776.96 --> 1782.8400000000001
World War Z future or something right

1780.559 --> 1785.36
when there's just too much freaking

1782.84 --> 1787.34
noise and chaos and unrest everywhere

1785.36 --> 1790.82
and then yeah you need those to

1787.34 --> 1793.34
basically cut through the giant wall of

1790.82 --> 1795.32
noise and chaos

1793.34 --> 1798.1999999999998
that would be there constantly in like

1795.32 --> 1801.02
World War Z scenario again right so that

1798.2 --> 1804.0800000000002
might have been like the the objective

1801.02 --> 1807.1
of the designing team for that

1804.08 --> 1808.72
right there's no

1807.1 --> 1811.58
imminent

1808.72 --> 1814.88
malevolence about that

1811.58 --> 1817.34
it's just that when it's applied there's

1814.88 --> 1819.14
gonna be negative consequences and I

1817.34 --> 1822.279
think the designers probably didn't

1819.14 --> 1822.279
really think about that

1825.26 --> 1831.559
right now of course the implementers

1828.559 --> 1834.1399999999999
which would be politicians and all that

1831.559 --> 1836.24
they might have kind of secretly known

1834.14 --> 1838.22
and be like oh yeah that's a great idea

1836.24 --> 1842.059
because we were actually already kind of

1838.22 --> 1844.3990000000001
building up to just agitating Society to

1842.059 --> 1848.899
like create this spiritual inflammation

1844.399 --> 1849.9189999999999
in preparation to 911 and all the wars

1848.899 --> 1852.9799999999998
and [ __ ]

1849.919 --> 1855.6200000000001
something like that right but that would

1852.98 --> 1857.84
be like real occult Play Rather I mean

1855.62 --> 1859.9399999999998
there was no dedicated design team like

1857.84 --> 1865.1789999999999
oh we're gonna ruin people's hearing

1859.94 --> 1865.179
yeah no that's ridiculous seriously

1867.64 --> 1874.7
right just

1870.62 --> 1877.2199999999998
consider things reasonably

1874.7 --> 1879.679
don't create asymptotes out of it

1877.22 --> 1883.82
immediately

1879.679 --> 1887.8990000000001
to bind it to some evil Overlord mindset

1883.82 --> 1890.6589999999999
that's just purely there to destroy

1887.899 --> 1893.2399999999998
I mean that sort of thing tends to sneak

1890.659 --> 1895.22
in more Slither in through the occult

1893.24 --> 1898.159
right through politicians that kind of

1895.22 --> 1900.32
realize like that look at the thing that

1898.159 --> 1902.6000000000001
the design team and all that have not

1900.32 --> 1904.399
thought about right it's the thing that

1902.6 --> 1906.86
nobody thought about that they can

1904.399 --> 1908.2399999999998
basically secretly play chess with in

1906.86 --> 1910.82
the background while nobody's even

1908.24 --> 1917.02
seeing it because they don't realize

1910.82 --> 1917.02
what that was yet see that's a cult play

1917.6 --> 1921.559
but design teams

1919.82 --> 1923.9189999999999
no

1921.559 --> 1927.86
no I mean those people are often very

1923.919 --> 1932.2990000000002
just mechanical driven and all that

1927.86 --> 1935.36
they don't care about playing Humanity

1932.299 --> 1938.6589999999999
they're just doing their engineering and

1935.36 --> 1939.08
designing and all that just trying to be

isn't that like an old

1972.32 --> 1978.8799999999999
like the the Old World War II Sirens

1975.14 --> 1978.88
like a bombing sirens

1982.22 --> 1985.88
I don't know what what the sound is of

1984.2 --> 1988.64
those Sirens there

1985.88 --> 1992.24
I mean we have like

1988.64 --> 1994.159
testing sirens for bombing

1992.24 --> 1996.679
like if there was a bombing or if there

1994.159 --> 1998.48
was a big war thing and it doesn't make

1996.679 --> 2001.26
any sense there's no even direct

1998.48 --> 2001.26
associated

2001.539 --> 2005.44
thing with it anymore it's just oh we

2003.46 --> 2007.96
have to test the sirens every freaking

2005.44 --> 2010.659
month on the Monday at 12 o'clock

2007.96 --> 2014.039
first Monday of the month

2010.659 --> 2014.0390000000002
they've been doing that

2015.58 --> 2021.1999999999998
for a very long time

2018.88 --> 2023.64
I think since the 90s

2021.2 --> 2025.98
[Music]

2023.64 --> 2028.8400000000001
every month

2025.98 --> 2032.14
every month

2028.84 --> 2034.539
for over two decades

2032.14 --> 2037.0590000000002
and it makes no sense because nobody

2034.539 --> 2038.799
even knows what to do with it

2037.059 --> 2042.1589999999999
everybody's just like oh there you go

2038.799 --> 2045.039
again wait there and it's gone forget

2042.159 --> 2048.099
about it like how is that going to

2045.039 --> 2050.32
result in like

2048.099 --> 2052.7200000000003
well the only thing that these this

2050.32 --> 2055.839
Rhythm siren thing does for me is make

2052.72 --> 2058.24
me realize oh I guess it's 12 o'clock at

2055.839 --> 2060.46
Monday the first in the month so it

2058.24 --> 2062.919
almost anchors me in time now it's

2060.46 --> 2065.8
almost like at the alarm another form of

2062.919 --> 2067.24
alarm clock isn't it that's a play in

2065.8 --> 2070.48
words there

2067.24 --> 2072.7599999999998
but like I doubt that it's gonna

2070.48 --> 2076.02
actually have a function now if anything

2072.76 --> 2076.0200000000004
real would happen

2076.839 --> 2081.339
like what if there was a surprise

2078.52 --> 2083.919
bombardment terrible idea that probably

2081.339 --> 2084.94
it's not gonna happen I I highly doubt

2083.919 --> 2086.52
that

2084.94 --> 2090.399
but then it's like

2086.52 --> 2091.599
like oh oh is it Monday again

2090.399 --> 2093.7
huh

2091.599 --> 2095.2200000000003
wait it's not Monday

2093.7 --> 2098.02
and then just

2095.22 --> 2099.7
right well unless those Sirens keep on

2098.02 --> 2101.5
going and going and going and then

2099.7 --> 2103.359
everybody would figure out like oh

2101.5 --> 2105.099
there's something wrong this thing is

2103.359 --> 2107.4
going off for like more than five

2105.099 --> 2107.4
minutes

2107.859 --> 2112.359
but

2109.3 --> 2114.82
it just seems so pointless that they've

2112.359 --> 2117.52
tested it like every

2114.82 --> 2120.3
freaking well

2117.52 --> 2120.3
for that long

2121.72 --> 2126.52
it's a weird little siren too it's not

2124.18 --> 2129.359
very ominous

2126.52 --> 2129.359
but weird

2138.28 --> 2144.3390000000004
every Wednesday

2140.94 --> 2145.96
Jesus Star KC

2144.339 --> 2148.24
okay but then on the other hand

2145.96 --> 2151.14
tornadoes you know in certain places

2148.24 --> 2155.3799999999997
certain regions yeah you do want

2151.14 --> 2157.839
a good tornado warning system

2155.38 --> 2160.44
in Florida and all that

2157.839 --> 2160.44
so

2160.72 --> 2164.98
but that's different I mean there's no

2162.7 --> 2167.9199999999996
natural hazards like that here

2164.98 --> 2172.14
it's purely it's almost like a

2167.92 --> 2172.14
memorandum to World War II

2173.02 --> 2176.859
really

2174.94 --> 2179.079
because

2176.859 --> 2182.4
yeah

2179.079 --> 2185.6800000000003
we don't have any any Supernatural house

2182.4 --> 2187.78
any heavy natural hazards it's just like

2185.68 --> 2190.74
oh worse that could happen is like oh

2187.78 --> 2193.42
damn it it rained a little more some

2190.74 --> 2195.8799999999997
miniature flooding in certain regions

2193.42 --> 2198.2200000000003
that's like the worst we get we don't

2195.88 --> 2200.619
get tornadoes here ever

2198.22 --> 2203.5
I mean sometimes very very sometimes

2200.619 --> 2206.5
very rarely you can see a tornado like

2203.5 --> 2209.2
off the coast at Sea that's like the

2206.5 --> 2211.359
closest it'll get

2209.2 --> 2214.7799999999997
there's no earthquakes

2211.359 --> 2215.619
or minor Tremors in the south of the

2214.78 --> 2217.9
country

2215.619 --> 2220.6800000000003
it's just no real serious natural

2217.9 --> 2223.599
hazards ever

2220.68 --> 2226.8999999999996
like the last official serious natural

2223.599 --> 2229.54
Hazard we had was like the flooding

2226.9 --> 2231.88
in the early 20th century

2229.54 --> 2234.339
and then everything flooded right it's

2231.88 --> 2236.8
like the dikes broke and just everything

2234.339 --> 2239.92
went to [ __ ]

2236.8 --> 2242.619
but other than that no

2239.92 --> 2244.8
I mean that's over a hundred years ago I

2242.619 --> 2244.8
think

2246.94 --> 2251.68
all right

2248.02 --> 2254.56
and yeah I mean

2251.68 --> 2257.9199999999996
poldering engineering has not exactly

2254.56 --> 2260.0789999999997
been standing still so I'm very

2257.92 --> 2262.2400000000002
confident in Dutch

2260.079 --> 2264.78
poldering engineering very very

2262.24 --> 2264.7799999999997
confident

2264.94 --> 2269.079
that there's nothing going to go wrong

2266.5 --> 2271.119
unless literally somebody just blows one

2269.079 --> 2273.82
up with a giant bomb or something but

2271.119 --> 2275.579
that would be

2273.82 --> 2278.02
evil

2275.579 --> 2279.52
they redeemable I doubt that's gonna

2278.02 --> 2282.64
happen

2279.52 --> 2284.68
[Music]

2282.64 --> 2285.3799999999997
like why

2284.68 --> 2288.8289999999997
anyway

2285.38 --> 2288.829
[Music]

2310.42 --> 2316.5
what

2312.22 --> 2316.5
okay last year what

2325.599 --> 2331.02
what how does that work right

2327.88 --> 2331.02
what are you talking about

2331.06 --> 2336.72
to get a text message was like where did

2334.119 --> 2336.7200000000003
that come from

2338.619 --> 2341.619
foreign

2365.859 --> 2368.859
anyway

2371.44 --> 2373.8
okay

2375.43 --> 2383.969
[Music]

2387.48 --> 2393.3
look but who's the missing child like

2390.579 --> 2393.3
what where

2403.42 --> 2409.26
I guess that milk cartons are aren't

2406.3 --> 2409.26
doing it for them anymore

2410.26 --> 2413.579
what a weird thing

2437.38 --> 2440.099
okay

2440.5 --> 2445.2
well that kind of seems pointless then

2442.599 --> 2445.2000000000003
nearly see

2469.2 --> 2477.18
[Music]

2472.32 --> 2477.1800000000003
I've never had any one of those ever

2478.42 --> 2483.42
but then again I don't have a smartphone

2480.46 --> 2483.42
so

2491.859 --> 2497.38
they put like weird alert things

2494.82 --> 2500.26
sometimes here on

2497.38 --> 2501.88
like the digital bus stop

2500.26 --> 2504.78
signs

2501.88 --> 2504.78
sometimes

2505.48 --> 2509.92
it's like this digital billboard system

2507.82 --> 2512.44
and yeah these things have been around

2509.92 --> 2515.32
for like since the 90s

2512.44 --> 2517.7200000000003
pretty interesting

2515.32 --> 2520.3
but they use them for that sometimes so

2517.72 --> 2522.0989999999997
I don't see it any kind of alert on the

2520.3 --> 2524.8
phone but sometimes it's like at the bus

2522.099 --> 2528.119
stops it's like suddenly there's weird

2524.8 --> 2528.119
alert text on there

2532.06 --> 2539.68
it's quite pointless most of the time

2535.72 --> 2541.8999999999996
and it was full of whining about coronu

2539.68 --> 2543.2799999999997
and mask and social distancing in the

2541.9 --> 2547.06
last two years

2543.28 --> 2550.0
not so much not anymore now though

2547.06 --> 2553.2599999999998
thank God right anyway I'm gonna take a

2550.0 --> 2553.26
two minute break I'll be right back

2588.339 --> 2591.18
foreign

2606.339 --> 2609.339
foreign

2639.819 --> 2645.339
ah man

2642.579 --> 2647.44
freaking Gustav holsters keep sneaking

2645.339 --> 2649.54
back in my head

2647.44 --> 2653.099
especially Hammer Smith

2649.54 --> 2655.7799999999997
gotta be careful with that song

2653.099 --> 2659.44
it is like

2655.78 --> 2661.9
it really is like just Lord of the Rings

2659.44 --> 2663.76
like your Frodo or something and a lot

2661.9 --> 2667.38
of it scary

2663.76 --> 2667.38
but exciting anyway uh

2672.76 --> 2678.6400000000003
not something somebody

2675.4 --> 2680.619
just as I was going out like one of the

2678.64 --> 2682.839
roommates literally stepped out of the

2680.619 --> 2685.06
door at exactly the same time and that

2682.839 --> 2686.44
kind of startled me

2685.06 --> 2687.0
so

2686.44 --> 2688.2400000000002
that's all

2687.0 --> 2690.839
[Music]

2688.24 --> 2690.839
uh

2692.0 --> 2700.59
[Music]

2706.119 --> 2710.46
what what are you talking about grow

2708.099 --> 2710.46
back

2718.02 --> 2721.14
all right

2721.24 --> 2726.2299999999996
Against One

2722.99 --> 2726.2299999999996
[Music]

2731.68 --> 2735.85
okay

2732.47 --> 2735.85
[Music]

2749.74 --> 2754.54
oh by the way to those watching I am

2752.8 --> 2756.7000000000003
very well aware of that this entire

2754.54 --> 2759.66
conversation so far has absolutely

2756.7 --> 2761.5
nothing to do with the title of the show

2759.66 --> 2765.7799999999997
foreign

2761.5 --> 2770.56
then again the title of my show is

2765.78 --> 2770.5600000000004
uh quite Universal

2771.46 --> 2777.3
it sounds actually the answer is very

2775.0 --> 2777.3
simple

2777.88 --> 2783.48
anyway I'll get to that

2781.18 --> 2786.839
right how to protect yourself against

2783.48 --> 2786.839
metadata damage

2803.44 --> 2807.88
oh what no

2811.37 --> 2816.9
[Music]

2821.72 --> 2828.3799999999997
[Music]

2839.44 --> 2844.619
is that what gangstalkers do that is

2841.9 --> 2844.619
really creepy

2844.96 --> 2850.78
I highly doubt it though that that

2848.2 --> 2854.2
particular roommate or any of them are

2850.78 --> 2856.599
like obsessed enough with me or scared

2854.2 --> 2860.5789999999997
enough to actually

2856.599 --> 2860.579
be that interested in what I'm doing

2874.18 --> 2877.18
numbers

2881.12 --> 2886.359
[Music]

2883.859 --> 2889.119
are they called an effect relationship

2886.359 --> 2891.94
to investigate yeah it's very simple we

2889.119 --> 2894.819
have a mobile phone

2891.94 --> 2897.04
and they're gonna try to [ __ ] with you

2894.819 --> 2901.56
that's the real

2897.04 --> 2901.56
issue there that's why I don't have one

2903.04 --> 2905.52
right

2907.26 --> 2912.579
thing about

2909.579 --> 2916.1400000000003
cheap and easy is that it's actually

2912.579 --> 2916.1400000000003
never cheap and easy

2927.24 --> 2931.5499999999997
[Music]

2940.33 --> 2945.94
[Music]

2942.94 --> 2945.94
foreign

2947.5 --> 2951.46
although of course yeah what I just said

2949.48 --> 2954.339
does not apply to

2951.46 --> 2955.9
old basic tools that have been used over

2954.339 --> 2957.2799999999997
and over and over again of course

2955.9 --> 2960.1600000000003
simplicity

2957.28 --> 2962.26
is often a great thing

2960.16 --> 2964.66
in design

2962.26 --> 2966.88
especially with things like tools

2964.66 --> 2970.18
but the point is is that smartphones

2966.88 --> 2971.92
were literally presented as an easy and

2970.18 --> 2975.3999999999996
cheap tool

2971.92 --> 2980.26
I mean they they almost gave them away a

2975.4 --> 2983.619
whole a whole period just to promote it

2980.26 --> 2985.8390000000004
made them cheap and easy

2983.619 --> 2987.6400000000003
well guess what they're not actually

2985.839 --> 2991.06
cheap and easy

2987.64 --> 2993.94
all that cheapness and ease is simply

2991.06 --> 2997.18
now going to be exploited over time as

2993.94 --> 3000.2400000000002
the the base using it have become

2997.18 --> 3002.52
dependent on it exclusively

3000.24 --> 3005.7
that's what it always

3002.52 --> 3007.02
was really for

3005.7 --> 3009.66
right

3007.02 --> 3011.22
offer something offer a deal you can't

3009.66 --> 3012.66
refuse

3011.22 --> 3015.7999999999997
then

3012.66 --> 3015.7999999999997
exploit that

3019.02 --> 3025.71
oh there you know PJ cruikshak you're

3021.9 --> 3028.889
spoiling me but thanks I'll check it

3045.14 --> 3052.98
so weird in the evening it never asks me

3048.48 --> 3057.319
for my freaking phone number and [ __ ]

3052.98 --> 3057.319
but during the day it always does

3057.599 --> 3061.869
that's weird

3058.67 --> 3061.869
[Music]

3062.94 --> 3068.0
oh man thank you

3065.579 --> 3068.0

3090.78 --> 3095.5400000000004

3112.98 --> 3118.339
I hadn't even noticed and that's how you

3114.9 --> 3118.339
notice it's actually going away

um

3142.22 --> 3146.48
everywhere you go and everything you

3144.059 --> 3146.48
know yeah

3148.44 --> 3153.839
right I guess we can move on to the uh

3151.619 --> 3156.119
the title of the show then protect

3153.839 --> 3159.02
yourself from metadata damage

3156.119 --> 3159.02
it's very simple

3159.119 --> 3162.6800000000003
don't do anything

3162.9 --> 3167.94
I think very carefully about this

3165.78 --> 3169.8590000000004
is an overview don't let it ruin all

3167.94 --> 3172.5
your spontaneity but you gotta give

3169.859 --> 3175.2599999999998
yourself a direction and objective a set

3172.5 --> 3179.42
of principles that you know that no

3175.26 --> 3179.42
matter who sees or hears it

3179.579 --> 3183.1800000000003
or learns about it learns about what you

3181.859 --> 3185.7
do

3183.18 --> 3189.02
that there's nothing

3185.7 --> 3189.02
they can do to

3189.24 --> 3192.72
well to disturb you

3191.579 --> 3195.3
right

3192.72 --> 3199.74
so for me that would be

3195.3 --> 3202.5
I do things as if I'm highly aware that

3199.74 --> 3206.839
God is watching at all time because he

3202.5 --> 3209.579
is right and I I have

3206.839 --> 3212.52
discarded the luxury

3209.579 --> 3215.94
to pretend like he isn't

3212.52 --> 3219.0
because that is what it is the luxury

3215.94 --> 3221.2200000000003
Satan a lie

3219.0 --> 3223.92
and I don't do that anymore I'm very

3221.22 --> 3226.68
strict about that and that way no matter

3223.92 --> 3229.44
what I do where I go even if I don't

3226.68 --> 3231.54
know the people that I'm talking to I

3229.44 --> 3234.3
know I'm safe even if they actually

3231.54 --> 3237.0589999999997
meant to set me up

3234.3 --> 3239.2200000000003
every time

3237.059 --> 3241.76
because it just doesn't matter it

3239.22 --> 3241.7599999999998
doesn't matter

3242.059 --> 3248.1600000000003
what their intentions are I'll figure it

3245.819 --> 3250.8
out on the way

3248.16 --> 3253.2
because I know I'm safe because I do

3250.8 --> 3256.6800000000003
everything as if God is watching at all

3253.2 --> 3258.54
time and everything I do really matters

3256.68 --> 3260.8799999999997
but you gotta find a very careful

3258.54 --> 3262.619
balance because everything matters but

3260.88 --> 3264.119
also everything doesn't really matter

3262.619 --> 3266.099
that much at all

3264.119 --> 3269.76
and you gotta realize

3266.099 --> 3271.5
which one is the real one in the moment

3269.76 --> 3275.46
and that's

3271.5 --> 3277.26
very difficult and once you it's well

3275.46 --> 3279.48
it's maybe it's not even not that

3277.26 --> 3283.1400000000003
difficult but it is extremely difficult

3279.48 --> 3286.8
to try to communicate what that is and

3283.14 --> 3289.2
how that is you just gotta figure it out

3286.8 --> 3292.2000000000003
you gotta tune your tuning for the right

3289.2 --> 3294.72
way and once you do it it just starts to

3292.2 --> 3296.7
work and you can't really explain it

3294.72 --> 3299.3999999999996
can describe what you're doing but you

3296.7 --> 3301.319
can't describe what that realization or

3299.4 --> 3306.1800000000003
that Insight really is

3301.319 --> 3308.16
it's just it just is anyway

3306.18 --> 3313.7
right but that's the ultimate protection

3308.16 --> 3317.3999999999996
against metadata it's a a vow of honesty

3313.7 --> 3321.2
absolute like even in the face of demons

3317.4 --> 3321.2000000000003
even in the face of death

3323.52 --> 3327.119
and if you do that

3325.26 --> 3330.96
then it doesn't matter what you do

3327.119 --> 3334.2000000000003
anymore because you can explain

3330.96 --> 3337.2200000000003
and reasonably justify anything that's

3334.2 --> 3337.22
picked up from you

3338.339 --> 3343.44
until you go slacking

3341.22 --> 3345.48
because if you do that

3343.44 --> 3347.04
then it doesn't matter that you have the

3345.48 --> 3349.44
principles

3347.04 --> 3351.72
if you're just slacking you're lazy

3349.44 --> 3353.4
you're backing down that's when just

3351.72 --> 3355.2
everything goes wrong and even all the

3353.4 --> 3358.079
good things you did in the past suddenly

3355.2 --> 3362.22
will turn inside out

3358.079 --> 3365.26
right so f word is a kind of a necessary

3362.22 --> 3368.3999999999996
principle to keep it stable

3365.26 --> 3369.78
[Music]

3368.4 --> 3372.1800000000003
that effect

3369.78 --> 3376.76
that you've got to be

3372.18 --> 3376.7599999999998
building you gotta be honorable

3377.04 --> 3382.5
you gotta face that the truth including

3379.44 --> 3384.599
the uncomfortable ones at least to know

3382.5 --> 3387.059
right you're not necessarily capable to

3384.599 --> 3388.92
do anything about it at all times with

3387.059 --> 3391.44
everything that you're gonna face

3388.92 --> 3394.079
but you must realize that eventually you

3391.44 --> 3396.18
will always have to and it starts by

3394.079 --> 3398.04
knowing that it exists and is real and

3396.18 --> 3399.24
not trying to avoid that or erase it

3398.04 --> 3400.319
from your mind

3399.24 --> 3404.24
okay

3400.319 --> 3404.24
it's getting a little complex now

3405.48 --> 3410.18
but uh

3407.64 --> 3410.18
yeah

3411.059 --> 3416.52
I feel very protected

3414.0 --> 3418.619
from metadata damage

3416.52 --> 3420.3
because I I remember everything that

3418.619 --> 3421.7400000000002
I've done and I know that it's been

3420.3 --> 3424.98
consistent

3421.74 --> 3428.5789999999997
including outbursts which I have

3424.98 --> 3431.88
basically not left wild but

3428.579 --> 3434.52
try to tame including rage win

3431.88 --> 3436.44
all of it is all part of it same

3434.52 --> 3438.18
principles the same direction the same

3436.44 --> 3439.859
directive

3438.18 --> 3444.1189999999997
the same effort

3439.859 --> 3448.38
and vision and that then

3444.119 --> 3451.44
kind of yeah esoterically just ensures

3448.38 --> 3454.559
that it just doesn't matter what

3451.44 --> 3457.339
information is picked up about you

3454.559 --> 3457.3390000000004
anywhere

3460.26 --> 3465.6600000000003
because you know you always basically do

3463.619 --> 3468.6600000000003
the right thing say the right thing and

3465.66 --> 3471.98
that is a very valuable asset

3468.66 --> 3471.98
spiritually to have

3472.02 --> 3476.7
to know that it you don't have to

3474.9 --> 3480.0
remember even everything you said

3476.7 --> 3481.3799999999997
because you know how you said it and how

3480.0 --> 3483.92
you work

3481.38 --> 3483.92
yeah

3484.14 --> 3488.5789999999997
and that's

3485.7 --> 3491.3999999999996
can even well if you have the talent for

3488.579 --> 3494.3390000000004
you for it can help you bring yourself

3491.4 --> 3496.5
to a position where you can even just

3494.339 --> 3498.98
almost as a luxury

3496.5 --> 3500.819
discard

3498.98 --> 3503.94
[Music]

3500.819 --> 3507.7799999999997
a lot of memory

3503.94 --> 3510.119
because you know you can trust

3507.78 --> 3513.059
what you've done you don't have to

3510.119 --> 3515.76
remember everything you don't have to

3513.059 --> 3520.02
have a space in your head where you

3515.76 --> 3523.7400000000002
specifically arrange the events actively

3520.02 --> 3525.96
you can leave it as a passive memory

3523.74 --> 3528.0589999999997
that just in the moment of energy you

3525.96 --> 3531.059
will be able to return to it

3528.059 --> 3532.6800000000003
if God allows it sometimes he doesn't

3531.059 --> 3535.44
you don't have to build anything you

3532.68 --> 3537.48
don't have to create and that way you

3535.44 --> 3540.599
also avoid lying

3537.48 --> 3543.599
right fabricating stories because that

3540.599 --> 3547.2000000000003
all stems from the same effects all of

3543.599 --> 3551.339
it it's one One Singular

3547.2 --> 3552.8999999999996
pattern diagram of energy and

3551.339 --> 3555.18
consequences and effects and it's all

3552.9 --> 3558.319
it's like a tapestry

3555.18 --> 3558.319
with a spectrum

3558.9 --> 3563.4
everything you do leads to another thing

3561.72 --> 3565.4399999999996
leads to another thing leads to another

3563.4 --> 3567.599
thing and the pattern is very distinct

3565.44 --> 3568.92
it's it's basically the pattern of

3567.599 --> 3570.7200000000003
corruption and

3568.92 --> 3572.94
you can't avoid

3570.72 --> 3574.5589999999997
dealing with that

3572.94 --> 3577.38
but you can

3574.559 --> 3578.599
with insight and decision and especially

3577.38 --> 3582.48
vision

3578.599 --> 3586.44
really cause it to slow down and to not

3582.48 --> 3590.599
corrupt and to outgrow the corruption

3586.44 --> 3590.599
that is an inevitable

3590.7 --> 3595.2
spiritually outgrow the inevitable

3592.74 --> 3597.18
corruption that you're going to

3595.2 --> 3598.68
be immersed in because that's what

3597.18 --> 3603.02
happens in life there's nothing you can

3598.68 --> 3607.2999999999997
do about it you can only try to

3603.02 --> 3614.349
present an alternative the way through

3607.3 --> 3614.349
[Music]

3615.02 --> 3621.66
right so I hope that you appreciated

3617.76 --> 3623.3390000000004
that as a Terry little speech

3621.66 --> 3625.0789999999997
that's how you protect yourself against

3623.339 --> 3628.14
metadata

3625.079 --> 3630.7400000000002
you just have to dedicate your entire

3628.14 --> 3634.2599999999998
life and being

3630.74 --> 3636.8999999999996
to certain set of principles

3634.26 --> 3640.7990000000004
and then it doesn't matter anymore what

3636.9 --> 3643.5
you said or or that you wouldn't even

3640.799 --> 3645.119
need to remember because you know that

3643.5 --> 3647.22
you never lie

3645.119 --> 3648.839
not even by accident

3647.22 --> 3651.72
and you know that you never leave

3648.839 --> 3653.7
anybody as a victim through your words

3651.72 --> 3655.14
alone I mean they can do it themselves

3653.7 --> 3658.0789999999997
in their head

3655.14 --> 3661.319
but not through your words

3658.079 --> 3663.0
because see let me give you an example

3661.319 --> 3664.5589999999997
let's just say I had a conversation with

3663.0 --> 3666.72
somebody that turned out to be kind of

3664.559 --> 3668.88
hostile afterward

3666.72 --> 3670.5
and I said certain things that might be

3668.88 --> 3673.5
a little spooky and then they would say

3670.5 --> 3675.119
to me you told me this your evil warlock

3673.5 --> 3678.0
because you told me about really dark

3675.119 --> 3680.4
things and it's all messed up and then I

3678.0 --> 3682.98
would say yeah but

3680.4 --> 3685.44
maybe not even remembering doing that

3682.98 --> 3687.2400000000002
but I know how I would have done it and

3685.44 --> 3691.14
I would have shared it

3687.24 --> 3693.1189999999997
see it's back engineering yourself based

3691.14 --> 3695.22
on the principles you don't have to

3693.119 --> 3697.5
remember you can literally reconstruct

3695.22 --> 3699.66
what you are if you're consistent enough

3697.5 --> 3701.819
you don't have to actively be able to

3699.66 --> 3705.24
remember you can reconstruct yourself

3701.819 --> 3707.22
and then watch the Reconstruction fit

3705.24 --> 3708.5699999999997
like a glove

3707.22 --> 3710.0989999999997
with the person

3708.57 --> 3714.44
[Music]

3710.099 --> 3714.44
and that's how I do it

3715.2 --> 3720.48
it only requires your entire life to be

3718.559 --> 3723.1800000000003
focused and dedicated and immersed in

3720.48 --> 3726.0
this and you're gonna be an outsider

3723.18 --> 3729.9199999999996
forever I mean

3726.0 --> 3729.92
yeah that's not a small price to pay

3730.559 --> 3736.3390000000004
but it certainly works and I wonder if

3733.44 --> 3736.339
this effect

3736.38 --> 3741.96
right if yeah

3738.96 --> 3744.059
even if you take it partially

3741.96 --> 3746.16
the principles of everything I explained

3744.059 --> 3748.92
about this even if you have partial

3746.16 --> 3750.839
things then you will know you will be

3748.92 --> 3752.2200000000003
safe on those things and then there

3750.839 --> 3754.619
might be other parts where you just say

3752.22 --> 3757.4399999999996
no I don't have control over this

3754.619 --> 3760.6800000000003
I don't see how I can

3757.44 --> 3763.44
so then you know oh if it involves that

3760.68 --> 3764.94
side that subject well then you are in

3763.44 --> 3767.579
danger and there's nothing really you

3764.94 --> 3771.299
can do about it but with the sides where

3767.579 --> 3775.76
you have stuck to solid principles

3771.299 --> 3775.7599999999998
thank you can just trust

3780.0 --> 3785.88
I'm hearing Gustav Holst in my head

3782.22 --> 3788.8799999999997
continually now this is

3785.88 --> 3791.579
I mean seriously Hammersmith is

3788.88 --> 3795.7200000000003
it's it's more than a song it's a vision

3791.579 --> 3798.599
it's a vision it's like a it's an event

3795.72 --> 3801.5989999999997
something that's that's real

3798.599 --> 3803.819
it's like a spiritual esoteric event and

3801.599 --> 3809.52
it's so important

3803.819 --> 3814.079
because it shows you how things work

3809.52 --> 3817.88
how the mind and the Heart works

3814.079 --> 3820.98
and it shows you the magic of

3817.88 --> 3824.78
unexpected synchronization and all kinds

3820.98 --> 3824.78
of things that are just well anyway

3826.83 --> 3831.54
[Music]

3832.92 --> 3839.65
kind of inspired

3835.58 --> 3839.65
[Music]

3840.299 --> 3846.14
I will look that up dude I literally

3842.76 --> 3846.1400000000003
shared the link of that

3847.079 --> 3852.0
in the show that has

3849.119 --> 3855.6800000000003
the host in the title

3852.0 --> 3855.68
yeah that's two days ago

3857.4 --> 3861.0
episode 1391

3861.96 --> 3864.5
Thursday

3866.52 --> 3871.7
it's mostly at the end of the show

3868.319 --> 3871.7
though that where I bring him up

3873.42 --> 3880.7000000000003
I'll share it again I mean why not

3876.9 --> 3880.7000000000003
it's just out there on YouTube

3883.38 --> 3889.1400000000003
uh

3885.599 --> 3891.1800000000003
but yeah be careful with it because

3889.14 --> 3894.24
if you're like emotionally slightly

3891.18 --> 3897.0589999999997
unstable or anything in that direction

3894.24 --> 3901.2
this music can [ __ ] you up because it is

3897.059 --> 3903.9
really up like this is this guy must

3901.2 --> 3905.16
have been an empath there is no other

3903.9 --> 3907.7400000000002
option

3905.16 --> 3910.02
there's no other option there's too much

3907.74 --> 3911.5789999999997
fractal structure

3910.02 --> 3914.4
within everything

3911.579 --> 3917.04
that he does it's too much he could not

3914.4 --> 3919.619
have not been an empath so you got to be

3917.04 --> 3921.599
careful because it also is spiritual

3919.619 --> 3924.559
challenges

3921.599 --> 3924.559
very serious music

3925.619 --> 3932.76
and there's a lot to learn about

3928.22 --> 3936.0
Humanity about life about God just

3932.76 --> 3938.1600000000003
through the music no text no text in

3936.0 --> 3940.98
there it's only music

3938.16 --> 3944.839
classical anyway

3940.98 --> 3944.839
let me share this is a link

3955.19 --> 3958.329
[Music]

3960.24 --> 3963.9599999999996
right I'm thinking by the way of

3961.859 --> 3965.819
actually diving a little deeper with

3963.96 --> 3967.319
Gustav Holst

3965.819 --> 3969.599
and

3967.319 --> 3971.839
like see if I can like download his

3969.599 --> 3974.04
entire

3971.839 --> 3975.9
bibliography or something this entire

3974.04 --> 3978.66
music works

3975.9 --> 3982.099
I mean I gotta listen to more of his

3978.66 --> 3982.0989999999997
works really somehow

3982.26 --> 3986.76
but I wouldn't be surprised if that was

3984.539 --> 3989.1800000000003
kind of expensive because well it's

3986.76 --> 3989.1800000000003
worth it

3991.11 --> 3994.219
[Music]

4007.339 --> 4010.339
foreign

4012.9 --> 4019.2200000000003
[Music]

4016.48 --> 4022.28
I don't know if I mentioned this

4019.22 --> 4024.5
in that particular show

4022.28 --> 4026.539
but yeah the Hammersmith song is

4024.5 --> 4030.2
probably

4026.539 --> 4032.92
the most influential song that has ever

4030.2 --> 4032.9199999999996
been written

4033.559 --> 4040.039
and if you listen very carefully you

4036.38 --> 4043.339
will literally recognize so much

4040.039 --> 4045.2000000000003
you'll be shocked you'll so when I first

4043.339 --> 4048.5
heard it do you know what I thought I

4045.2 --> 4051.98
thought this guy made like the ultimate

4048.5 --> 4053.48
combination of movie music

4051.98 --> 4055.4
that's what I thought which is

4053.48 --> 4059.539
preposterous because

4055.4 --> 4062.48
there were no movies back then no this

4059.539 --> 4067.579
guy literally created

4062.48 --> 4071.5
the vastus influence of movie music

4067.579 --> 4071.5
ever in human history

4072.44 --> 4079.059
have I seen the film Tron yeah of course

4076.46 --> 4079.059

4141.859 --> 4145.42
where the hell are you

4155.5 --> 4160.719
I want to be somewhere ah here it is

4171.14 --> 4175.819
amazing movie

4173.12 --> 4178.8189999999995
the Ultron it also has like one of my

4175.819 --> 4182.1990000000005
favorite older actors

4178.819 --> 4182.1990000000005
who also played

4185.6 --> 4190.219
again

4188.06 --> 4192.5
yeah Jeff Bridges of course a lot of

4190.219 --> 4195.04
people know him

4192.5 --> 4195.04
that's it

4201.34 --> 4206.7390000000005
okay I keep forgetting that guy's name

4204.02 --> 4209.42
but he's also like well one of the most

4206.739 --> 4211.9
important characters in Babylon five he

4209.42 --> 4211.9
plays that

4212.12 --> 4222.38
[ __ ] that up

4214.48 --> 4226.459999999999
[Music]

4222.38 --> 4229.6
yeah Bruce box Lightner

4226.46 --> 4229.6
he's really young in that

4229.84 --> 4235.04
[Music]

4231.5 --> 4237.14
but yeah I mean I really like that actor

4235.04 --> 4239.679
because of just the way that he can talk

4237.14 --> 4239.679
and all that

4239.719 --> 4245.36
he's like always like this super moral

4242.3 --> 4248.360000000001
boost type of character I love it

4245.36 --> 4248.36
foreign

4256.96 --> 4263.96
to see it like a cameo of him also in

4260.659 --> 4266.62
the in the Tron Legacy movie

4263.96 --> 4266.62
was awesome

4277.28 --> 4279.82
things

4282.08 --> 4288.64
yeah yeah

4283.42 --> 4291.38
but uh yeah no I love those movies

4288.64 --> 4293.4800000000005
I mean I don't love them so much that I

4291.38 --> 4294.62
would con like watch it every year or

4293.48 --> 4296.599999999999
anything

4294.62 --> 4298.84
but yeah I'm just glad those movies are

4296.6 --> 4298.84
around

4299.78 --> 4304.699
yeah Trump Legacy yeah it's well Trump

4302.179 --> 4306.679
Legacy was let's just be fair it was not

4304.699 --> 4309.5
as good as the old one

4306.679 --> 4313.159
but that's also because the old one was

4309.5 --> 4316.04
in a time when things were really

4313.159 --> 4319.759999999999
different and that old movie really

4316.04 --> 4322.58
palpably captured that Spirit of that

4319.76 --> 4324.9800000000005
age and what the people were like

4322.58 --> 4326.179
and that's what made the real magic of

4324.98 --> 4329.78
Tron

4326.179 --> 4331.6990000000005
it's that it is like a snapshot of

4329.78 --> 4335.0599999999995
computer development

4331.699 --> 4338.0
when it was in the very young stage and

4335.06 --> 4341.2390000000005
that's like unique and Tron legacy did

4338.0 --> 4343.0
not capture that but it did kind of show

4341.239 --> 4348.459999999999
well

4343.0 --> 4348.46
progression curve of the tech

4349.4 --> 4354.0199999999995
and also the yeah potential for

4351.62 --> 4356.239
corruption Etc right

4354.02 --> 4358.59
shows you well much more where we are

4356.239 --> 4360.379999999999
now at now

4358.59 --> 4362.360000000001
[Music]

4360.38 --> 4365.96
yeah I agree

4362.36 --> 4369.339999999999
it's amazing movie in a different scale

4365.96 --> 4369.34
because it's a different time

4375.02 --> 4379.88
but yeah I did appreciate your own

4377.12 --> 4380.91
legacy oh that's why I haven't have it

4379.88 --> 4394.05
on Blu-ray

4380.91 --> 4394.05

4410.54 --> 4416.62

a lot

4425.42 --> 4429.4
sky looks totally different now

4436.4 --> 4440.98
I think there's even a bit of Blue Sky

4438.08 --> 4440.98
over there huh

4442.52 --> 4445.120000000001
all right

4459.12 --> 4464.239

4464.239 --> 4469.639999999999
Graphics yes

4465.92 --> 4472.4
and they had the perfect trick for it

4469.64 --> 4474.14
over lighting it's just oh you take

4472.4 --> 4476.5599999999995
shape yeah they're just stupid boring

4474.14 --> 4479.06
shapes you just put a bunch of light

4476.56 --> 4480.92
scattering effects and [ __ ] and it's

4479.06 --> 4482.38
like oh no it's cool now it's kind of

4480.92 --> 4486.08
like

4482.38 --> 4489.26
retro even then it was like a retro type

4486.08 --> 4492.199
of art it what Tron reminded me a lot

4489.26 --> 4493.9400000000005
about also was what's I keep forgetting

4492.199 --> 4496.04
the name of that one of the oldest

4493.94 --> 4498.5599999999995
movies ever I think it was a silent

4496.04 --> 4503.78
movie where they had like the robot girl

4498.56 --> 4507.679
and all that it just reminded me of that

4503.78 --> 4509.239
the style like Tron the Ultron was even

4507.679 --> 4511.88
kind of retro

4509.239 --> 4514.218999999999
that's very

4511.88 --> 4516.1
yeah Metropolis that's the one thank you

4514.219 --> 4517.699
thank

4516.1 --> 4522.280000000001
Metropolis

4517.699 --> 4522.28

[Music]

4536.659 --> 4542.599999999999

4544.219 --> 4549.8
up for Halloween

4546.62 --> 4553.719
I mean we don't celebrate in here like

4549.8 --> 4553.719

4592.1 --> 4595.900000000001

4635.48 --> 4641.86

4638.719 --> 4641.86
with Jack Sparrow

4665.54 --> 4667.9

4795.56 --> 4798.46
right anyway

4800.06 --> 4803.679
I'll open the place this show

4804.26 --> 4811.780000000001
good moments though esoterics

4808.4 --> 4811.78
involving the title

4812.12 --> 4817.5199999999995
right also own Benjamin has been kind of

4815.06 --> 4820.900000000001
crushing it recently

4817.52 --> 4820.900000000001
we had a show

4821.6 --> 4824.320000000001
which one was that

4826.4 --> 4829.36
what was that from Wednesday

4829.46 --> 4837.26
really really interesting things

4833.48 --> 4839.54
it's like some serious fractal diving

4837.26 --> 4841.58
what he's done there I mean and like

4839.54 --> 4844.64
multiple points

4841.58 --> 4845.659
was really interesting and

4844.64 --> 4848.179
right

4845.659 --> 4850.599999999999
I still have to catch up on with the

4848.179 --> 4850.6
rest though

4850.82 --> 4856.5199999999995
is going after some weird

4853.52 --> 4856.52
immoral

4856.699 --> 4860.96
figure

4858.44 --> 4862.5199999999995
I mean Benjamin does that he goes after

4860.96 --> 4865.76
weird figures

4862.52 --> 4868.580000000001
just like Jim Bob does

4865.76 --> 4870.62
oh by the way Jim Bob just broke up with

4868.58 --> 4875.12
Brenda

4870.62 --> 4879.26
kicked her out in out permanently

4875.12 --> 4881.719
because what did she say oh yeah an inch

4879.26 --> 4884.179
is scientific

4881.719 --> 4886.699
that's what she said that

4884.179 --> 4888.7390000000005
you can apply the scientific method to

4886.699 --> 4891.28
an inch and that was just too much for

4888.739 --> 4891.28
them up

4895.1 --> 4898.900000000001
which I totally get by the way

4905.78 --> 4910.639999999999
what platform is he on he's always on

4908.96 --> 4913.4800000000005
the same

4910.64 --> 4917.62
I always [ __ ] you always [ __ ] you

4913.48 --> 4917.62
hasn't really changed at all

4922.94 --> 4926.98
and Jim Bob is still on YouTube

4951.62 --> 4954.62
foreign

4973.699 --> 4976.699
list

4982.1 --> 4985.3

4985.46 --> 4991.96
but yeah let me hear this channel

4989.0 --> 4991.96
there you go

5013.56 --> 5016.729
[Music]

5018.699 --> 5021.36
foreign

5040.54 --> 5043.54
anyway

5051.64 --> 5055.360000000001
I might be getting a cold or something

5053.5 --> 5056.7
just

5055.36 --> 5059.5
hope not

5056.7 --> 5063.46
[Music]

5059.5 --> 5066.239
but hey if my body needs that then my

5063.46 --> 5066.2390000000005
body needs that

5104.44 --> 5110.0199999999995
right anyway

5106.54 --> 5112.8
hope you guys are enjoying the show

5110.02 --> 5112.8
uh

5114.159 --> 5116.699
what else

5129.28 --> 5133.0
let's bring those go go Wing insane is

5132.219 --> 5135.46
she

5133.0 --> 5138.34
the man like no no Brenda's been insane

5135.46 --> 5141.94
for quite some time

5138.34 --> 5145.08
oh probably well before we got to know

5141.94 --> 5145.08
him and her whatever

5146.5 --> 5152.44
thoughts on AI generated art

5149.26 --> 5154.7390000000005
I did address that a whole like months

5152.44 --> 5154.739
ago

5155.5 --> 5158.04
right

5161.98 --> 5166.86
I mean

5163.48 --> 5166.86
this type of capability

5167.38 --> 5173.92
like bypassing even like how did they do

5171.04 --> 5176.32
it right bypassing that

5173.92 --> 5177.58
I think that it's a detrimental

5176.32 --> 5179.86
influence

5177.58 --> 5181.84
because it's going to set standards

5179.86 --> 5184.179
higher

5181.84 --> 5186.219
and then make it more difficult for

5184.179 --> 5187.4800000000005
actually for actual artists that are

5186.219 --> 5188.92
doing that

5187.48 --> 5192.159
like

5188.92 --> 5195.28
by hand and all that

5192.159 --> 5198.759999999999
to catch up right to

5195.28 --> 5202.54
to compare I mean if you're like busy

5198.76 --> 5205.900000000001
for 20 hours on the painting

5202.54 --> 5209.199
it's awesome and then somebody shows a

5205.9 --> 5211.839999999999
painting generated by AI that looks

5209.199 --> 5213.219
almost as good and took literally two

5211.84 --> 5215.92
seconds to make

5213.219 --> 5219.94
that sucks

5215.92 --> 5223.78
that's if that is like that kills

5219.94 --> 5226.599999999999
art making Spirit you see because you

5223.78 --> 5228.699
can't compete with that and then the

5226.6 --> 5231.3
real magic doesn't happen anymore

5228.699 --> 5231.299999999999
because

5231.699 --> 5236.799999999999
yeah you're gonna Vibe you're not gonna

5233.92 --> 5238.84
do it and then the magical personal side

5236.8 --> 5241.5
of it is not gonna be able to develop

5238.84 --> 5245.08
and express itself so I think that does

5241.5 --> 5248.139
AI generating systems are actually

5245.08 --> 5251.639
art spirit Destroyers

5248.139 --> 5251.639
and it's very dangerous

5258.42 --> 5265.06
now as an amusement tool right if you're

5262.54 --> 5267.82
not actually an artist

5265.06 --> 5271.900000000001
sure I mean yeah

5267.82 --> 5274.42
it's just like any other weird AI system

5271.9 --> 5276.46
right you have that AI system that makes

5274.42 --> 5279.58
little movies

5276.46 --> 5281.7390000000005
that are really bizarre

5279.58 --> 5283.42
right well that's just another yeah if

5281.739 --> 5286.959999999999
you're just oh I want to see something

5283.42 --> 5289.9
new yeah well go ahead

5286.96 --> 5291.699
until you completely figure it out

5289.9 --> 5293.5
and then you'll get bored and move on to

5291.699 --> 5296.0199999999995
the next thing as usual that's people

5293.5 --> 5296.94
looking for amusement do

5296.02 --> 5299.4400000000005
but

5296.94 --> 5302.379999999999
[Music]

5299.44 --> 5305.0199999999995
there's no Spirit or myth get the [ __ ]

5302.38 --> 5306.76
out of here Aries

5305.02 --> 5308.5
that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard

5306.76 --> 5310.42
you say

5308.5 --> 5313.26
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

5310.42 --> 5313.26
talking about dude

5313.36 --> 5319.0
no spirit

5315.639 --> 5323.8
poor magic to Art right

5319.0 --> 5325.56
except that art is exclusively

5323.8 --> 5329.56
the entire

5325.56 --> 5332.679
origin of magic pretty much

5329.56 --> 5335.04
influence influence on the mind on the

5332.679 --> 5338.08
spirit on the internals reflection

5335.04 --> 5341.56
Hidden Truths that

5338.08 --> 5344.739
people making it often didn't even

5341.56 --> 5348.42
consciously realize yeah art has no

5344.739 --> 5348.419999999999
magic get the [ __ ] out of here

5350.44 --> 5353.219
series

5356.86 --> 5362.199
AI written articles kills writer

5359.199 --> 5364.9
spiritual Maybe

5362.199 --> 5367.379999999999
but AI written articles are just not

5364.9 --> 5367.379999999999
very good

5368.08 --> 5374.8
and the less people influence what the

5371.679 --> 5377.8
AI does with that afterward

5374.8 --> 5380.02
the more bland it will become

5377.8 --> 5381.58
an indistinguishable from just

5380.02 --> 5383.8
background chatter

5381.58 --> 5387.4
and then people will lose interest right

5383.8 --> 5389.860000000001
because it's only the unique artistry

5387.4 --> 5392.379999999999
even of a writer that is actually

5389.86 --> 5395.62
compelling and like the consistency of

5392.38 --> 5398.26
it and how new things unfold that's the

5395.62 --> 5399.46
unique trademark of the spirit of

5398.26 --> 5401.38
somebody's art

5399.46 --> 5403.92
whether it's writing or painting or

5401.38 --> 5403.92
making music

5407.94 --> 5412.739
yeah no you're just a [ __ ] [ __ ]

5413.199 --> 5418.299999999999
I live Magic

5416.08 --> 5420.28
I don't give a [ __ ] if you don't believe

5418.3 --> 5421.42
in it yeah

5420.28 --> 5423.46
yeah

5421.42 --> 5426.219
people believe don't believe in God

5423.46 --> 5428.08
should I give a [ __ ] it's your [ __ ]

5426.219 --> 5430.12
problem man you don't believe in it

5428.08 --> 5432.28
that's your [ __ ] problem you closed

5430.12 --> 5435.699
yourself off from it

5432.28 --> 5438.12
now you deal with that I'm not

5435.699 --> 5443.2699999999995
I didn't close off anything

5438.12 --> 5443.2699999999995
[Music]

5458.56 --> 5461.56
foreign

5465.84 --> 5471.639
written articles yeah they would suck

5468.54 --> 5474.04
unless it they you just use it as a

5471.639 --> 5476.92
template if you just have an air I write

5474.04 --> 5479.139
a certain template article and then as

5476.92 --> 5481.96
the artist you fill it in right you

5479.139 --> 5485.02
chisel it it's like you let the AI do

5481.96 --> 5487.42
the rough cutting and then you

5485.02 --> 5489.280000000001
yeah you do the detail work as the

5487.42 --> 5490.84
actual writer yeah that's a way you

5489.28 --> 5492.88
could deal with it and then it would

5490.84 --> 5496.4800000000005
still be interested it would just be an

5492.88 --> 5500.02
AI templating system then right

5496.48 --> 5502.839999999999
but if you just only let the AI just

5500.02 --> 5505.719
roll it out and leave it as is

5502.84 --> 5508.3
that's not gonna work

5505.719 --> 5513.54
not gonna work

5508.3 --> 5513.54
gonna feel it out and then lose interest

5515.26 --> 5521.02
it's gonna feel like 100 platitudes

5519.4 --> 5523.62
that's what it does

5521.02 --> 5523.620000000001
right

5543.28 --> 5547.5599999999995
okay Aries that's weird

5548.48 --> 5552.929999999999
[Music]

5572.62 --> 5578.46
no to our Casey that does not mean a

5575.62 --> 5578.46
computer is sentient

5584.139 --> 5589.06
right in order to be sentient you also

5588.04 --> 5592.6
need

5589.06 --> 5594.639
conscious awareness you need to have an

5592.6 --> 5598.0
ego element

5594.639 --> 5601.12
an identity a thing that is completely

5598.0 --> 5602.44
separated from just material reactive

5601.12 --> 5605.08
responses

5602.44 --> 5607.54
right like the Consciousness which is

5605.08 --> 5609.82
Supernatural it is outside of the

5607.54 --> 5613.179
physical normal reality but it is a

5609.82 --> 5615.0599999999995
component that is measurably there

5613.179 --> 5618.719
that's what you need for sentience

5615.06 --> 5618.719
computers don't have that

5626.98 --> 5630.879999999999
right

5628.0 --> 5634.199
and even computers supposedly emulating

5630.88 --> 5635.9800000000005
a human all they're doing is just

5634.199 --> 5639.879999999999
mimicking

5635.98 --> 5640.919999999999
they're just rolling out templates based

5639.88 --> 5644.7390000000005
on

5640.92 --> 5646.719
psychological research and and just like

5644.739 --> 5648.04
trying to like what would be a real

5646.719 --> 5649.84
response

5648.04 --> 5651.82
and then why and how you tie that in

5649.84 --> 5653.56
with reasoning systems and decision

5651.82 --> 5654.46
making within that blah blah blah all

5653.56 --> 5657.280000000001
that

5654.46 --> 5660.04
right it's just a mimic

5657.28 --> 5662.679
they're just following a pattern

5660.04 --> 5665.679
that they are programmed to follow a

5662.679 --> 5667.3
routine that would make them seem very

5665.679 --> 5670.1990000000005
human

5667.3 --> 5670.1990000000005
that's it

5675.76 --> 5680.56
right because a computer any computer

5678.159 --> 5683.099999999999
cannot do anything outside of its

5680.56 --> 5683.1
programming

5683.199 --> 5686.98
right that doesn't mean it can't do

5685.0 --> 5689.08
anything

5686.98 --> 5691.12
after the programmer stops programming

5689.08 --> 5693.5199999999995
because it can be programmed to be able

5691.12 --> 5695.5
to program itself to a certain degree

5693.52 --> 5698.8
right or adapt

5695.5 --> 5702.639
but still only following the program it

5698.8 --> 5704.5
can't separate from the program

5702.639 --> 5707.86
no computer can

5704.5 --> 5710.62
without the program there is no computer

5707.86 --> 5713.339999999999
it's just a device

5710.62 --> 5713.34
doing nothing

5715.9 --> 5719.83
[Music]

5725.86 --> 5733.86
no real architecture okay

5729.88 --> 5733.86
it's still just being programmed

5737.38 --> 5743.32
right so yeah they can and they can

5740.26 --> 5744.820000000001
simulate potentially a physical brain

5743.32 --> 5747.54
they might get to the point where

5744.82 --> 5750.88
they're like yes we're gonna literally

5747.54 --> 5753.699
simulate physical reality and a brain

5750.88 --> 5755.32
which is such an insane task I don't

5753.699 --> 5757.12
like it doesn't matter how much

5755.32 --> 5759.04
computing power or energy you have I

5757.12 --> 5762.36
don't think you could do that

5759.04 --> 5765.88
truly because I don't think there's real

5762.36 --> 5767.5599999999995
limitations on well the complexity of

5765.88 --> 5772.3
the brain

5767.56 --> 5774.820000000001
it's potentially infinitely complex

5772.3 --> 5776.320000000001
that only works because of organic

5774.82 --> 5778.12
system

5776.32 --> 5780.699
and the conjunction with the spirit

5778.12 --> 5782.739
because of the design of God don't think

5780.699 --> 5784.659
it can exist outside of God and I don't

5782.739 --> 5787.239
think we can make anything that would

5784.659 --> 5789.839999999999
recreate it like God I don't think

5787.239 --> 5789.839999999999
that's possible

5791.139 --> 5797.28
right but you could within a digital

5794.8 --> 5800.38
virtual simulation

5797.28 --> 5802.0
attempt to simulate

5800.38 --> 5806.4400000000005
a brain

5802.0 --> 5808.9
and then see if you can make it within

5806.44 --> 5811.299999999999
that simulation believe that it's real

5808.9 --> 5814.839999999999
and sentient and then

5811.3 --> 5817.719
yes sort of got something sentient but

5814.84 --> 5819.46
it only within the emulation not within

5817.719 --> 5822.06
the physical world

5819.46 --> 5822.06
so

5822.58 --> 5829.78
there's a lot of effort to do something

5825.76 --> 5829.780000000001
that is quite pointless

5834.88 --> 5840.58
I mean you could spend

5837.78 --> 5843.219
hundreds of thousands of hours and

5840.58 --> 5847.3
billions of dollars on a super complex

5843.219 --> 5851.38
computer system database and programmers

5847.3 --> 5853.54
and Engineers to simulate that brain and

5851.38 --> 5856.3
figure out sentience

5853.54 --> 5858.34
or you could just make a baby and see it

5856.3 --> 5860.56
happen because it's all there it's

5858.34 --> 5863.08
already designed right there

5860.56 --> 5865.780000000001
right I mean

5863.08 --> 5869.58
let's say that the second option is a

5865.78 --> 5869.58
lot more efficient wouldn't you

5878.88 --> 5888.03
foreign anyway

5882.36 --> 5888.03
[Music]

5894.4 --> 5899.379999999999
AI being sent yeah of course they want

5897.219 --> 5903.46
to make it all personal but that's just

5899.38 --> 5906.82
marketing and it's lies Terry 306 yeah

5903.46 --> 5909.58
no computer could ever be sentient

5906.82 --> 5911.32
not like that that's that happens in

5909.58 --> 5914.92
Star Trek because it's science fiction

5911.32 --> 5918.219
because there they can just magically

5914.92 --> 5920.7390000000005
conjure a spirit that arises in the

5918.219 --> 5923.32
machine has that actually ever been

5920.739 --> 5925.419999999999
demonstrated in any level

5923.32 --> 5927.94
because I think that's purely science

5925.42 --> 5930.639
fiction and it's something that's echoed

5927.94 --> 5933.638999999999
it's it's an echo sentiment in science

5930.639 --> 5935.8
fiction that machines suddenly wake up

5933.639 --> 5939.76
and like oh I'm

5935.8 --> 5942.96
want to be like a human right Johnny 5.

5939.76 --> 5942.96
Short Circuit

5944.739 --> 5950.0199999999995
this is not a

5947.199 --> 5952.0599999999995
very new idea but it is purely science

5950.02 --> 5955.0
fiction and I don't think it's based on

5952.06 --> 5957.52
any level of actual real world

5955.0 --> 5961.36
demonstration it's just a fantasy that

5957.52 --> 5965.02
we like to have to kind of project God's

5961.36 --> 5968.44
power on the power of creating the new

5965.02 --> 5970.06
baby a machine baby and then suddenly it

5968.44 --> 5972.638999999999
gains Consciousness just like your

5970.06 --> 5975.400000000001
little baby suddenly wakes up and gains

5972.639 --> 5979.2390000000005
his faculties right that's what that

5975.4 --> 5982.42
fantasy is that's it you know it you

5979.239 --> 5984.699
know it it's not based on any physical

5982.42 --> 5988.42
empirical thing now because that never

5984.699 --> 5991.48
ever happened a ghost never got into a

5988.42 --> 5993.82
machine and then suddenly

5991.48 --> 5996.4
did anything to indicate that it was

5993.82 --> 5998.32
anything else than just a error that

5996.4 --> 6000.12
would cause more degradation and

5998.32 --> 6002.699
breakdown

6000.12 --> 6005.46
it's never happened it's never like oh a

6002.699 --> 6007.138999999999
mistake and suddenly it's

6005.46 --> 6010.9800000000005
it's another stupid

6007.139 --> 6014.04
Revolution fantasy too evolution of the

6010.98 --> 6015.919999999999
machines the spirit will suddenly evolve

6014.04 --> 6018.96
in it and then it's getting sentience

6015.92 --> 6022.38
fantasy all fantasy

6018.96 --> 6026.28
it's a transhumanist fantasy

6022.38 --> 6028.26
and it stems from Evolution thinking and

6026.28 --> 6030.719
from projecting

6028.26 --> 6031.860000000001
well what actually happened by God's

6030.719 --> 6034.86
design

6031.86 --> 6037.199
The Awakening of a character if there

6034.86 --> 6039.659
was originally just a baby right that's

6037.199 --> 6041.699
magical that's God by God's design it

6039.659 --> 6043.879999999999
happens like pretty much every time

6041.699 --> 6047.82
unless you like pump them full of poison

6043.88 --> 6050.84
don't do that right it happens every

6047.82 --> 6053.219
time and this fantasy of the sentience

6050.84 --> 6056.34
Awakening in the robot

6053.219 --> 6059.76
is based on the projection of that

6056.34 --> 6063.4800000000005
effect the man wants it they want that

6059.76 --> 6065.88
sudden Awakening in their baby not by

6063.48 --> 6067.879999999999
God not God made no man built the

6065.88 --> 6071.52
machine and then it awakens

6067.88 --> 6074.82
Frankenstein two in his way right and

6071.52 --> 6076.860000000001
hey Metropolis literally

6074.82 --> 6079.44
it's fantasy

6076.86 --> 6081.839999999999
it will never happen there's no actual

6079.44 --> 6083.04
real world example where that has

6081.84 --> 6087.78
happened

6083.04 --> 6090.179
in any form not even the minute forms

6087.78 --> 6093.179
you see

6090.179 --> 6096.6
now look how long we've been pulled

6093.179 --> 6099.2390000000005
around on this fantasy it's very popular

6096.6 --> 6103.02
a lot of people out there believe it but

6099.239 --> 6105.78
based on what absolutely nothing

6103.02 --> 6107.9400000000005
absolutely nothing

6105.78 --> 6110.28
there's no indication

6107.94 --> 6112.259999999999
that sentience can

6110.28 --> 6114.119
arrive

6112.26 --> 6116.1
in machinery

6114.119 --> 6118.739
that that's a possibility

6116.1 --> 6121.219
no indication it's always been a fantasy

6118.739 --> 6121.218999999999
always

6121.5 --> 6124.04
before

6124.1 --> 6128.6990000000005
Pinocchio another sentient's Trope yeah

6126.48 --> 6130.98
but you know where it really also comes

6128.699 --> 6132.119
from it's older it's also the idea of

6130.98 --> 6136.5199999999995
the Golem

6132.119 --> 6136.5199999999995
guess who's dead where'd that come from

6137.48 --> 6144.659
yes but yeah you could say that it's

6141.0 --> 6147.6
their idea the Golem

6144.659 --> 6149.759999999999
an inanimate thing infused with the

6147.6 --> 6152.639
spirit

6149.76 --> 6155.42
but even they kind of realize that

6152.639 --> 6158.04
Golems are not sentient

6155.42 --> 6161.28
their animated

6158.04 --> 6163.38
puppet things they don't have sentience

6161.28 --> 6166.32
so that's actually a bit of a straw man

6163.38 --> 6169.86
but I do think that the idea was

6166.32 --> 6172.139
originally inspired on the Golem

6169.86 --> 6175.32
I think that's where all that science

6172.139 --> 6177.4800000000005
fiction the sentient computer has

6175.32 --> 6179.04
stemmed from

6177.48 --> 6180.659
historically

6179.04 --> 6183.6
that's where the people got the idea

6180.659 --> 6185.46
within transhumanism through the Golem

6183.6 --> 6187.400000000001
the Golem story

6185.46 --> 6190.199
foreign

6187.4 --> 6193.679
I pay attention to these things

6190.199 --> 6195.96
matters it matters a lot

6193.679 --> 6199.5
right some people say follow the money

6195.96 --> 6201.9
well I follow the story Roots where did

6199.5 --> 6203.58
the idea actually come from it's so

6201.9 --> 6207.119
revealing

6203.58 --> 6209.659
once you realize the the true roots of

6207.119 --> 6209.659
an idea

6210.44 --> 6213.66
[Music]

6222.239 --> 6226.58
right but you could definitely say much

6225.06 --> 6228.719
more clear-cut that for example

6226.58 --> 6231.36
Frankenstein's monster

6228.719 --> 6233.9
was based on the Golem

6231.36 --> 6236.699
they basically made a flash go I mean

6233.9 --> 6241.199
Frankenstein's monster is a flash Golem

6236.699 --> 6244.099999999999
I mean literally it's just

6241.199 --> 6247.9
that's what that is

6244.1 --> 6250.679
modernized flesh Golem

6247.9 --> 6254.759999999999
[Music]

6250.679 --> 6257.46
but yeah with a brain in it and that

6254.76 --> 6260.219
means it's alive or something I don't

6257.46 --> 6264.6
know it's an it's a mess

6260.219 --> 6267.78
but it is basically just the flesh goal

6264.6 --> 6270.119000000001
the Frankenstein's monster anyway ah

6267.78 --> 6274.159
I think I'm gonna round out the show

6270.119 --> 6274.159
