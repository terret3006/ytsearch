yeah today it's it's just

59.879 --> 66.0
unbelievably hot so freaking hot it's

63.6 --> 69.43900000000001
just insane

66.0 --> 73.119
look at that there were actually

69.439 --> 76.79899999999999
some chemtrails earlier i

73.119 --> 79.2
can't see him anymore it's well maybe

76.799 --> 81.04
way over there in the distance it's just

79.2 --> 84.64
that seems to all just

81.04 --> 88.47900000000001
dissolve whatever it was it's just this

84.64 --> 94.24
insanely blue sky and the sun is just

88.479 --> 94.24
so hot and the wind is hot as well

95.28 --> 101.84
look it's just what it is

99.28 --> 101.84
it's

103.04 --> 115.84
it's just pure blue

107.119 --> 115.84
every part

119.84 --> 124.88000000000001
the other days when it was warm there

121.759 --> 128.399
were some clouds at least but

124.88 --> 132.07999999999998
not today

128.399 --> 134.72
ah so yeah uh even with the white shirt

132.08 --> 137.36
on it was just too freaking hot

134.72 --> 138.0
like even outside in the shadow it was

137.36 --> 142.72000000000003
too hot

138.0 --> 146.56
with the t-shirt

142.72 --> 148.64
so anyway i got green tea but i didn't

146.56 --> 150.879
even pour it in because

148.64 --> 152.319
even after i made it i realized it's so

150.879 --> 154.48
warm

152.319 --> 157.11999999999998
it's probably not gonna be too pleasant

154.48 --> 160.23899999999998
to even

157.12 --> 163.59900000000002
yeah to even drink it

160.239 --> 165.519
warm and all so i but

163.599 --> 168.23899999999998
i have some other stuff too i have

165.519 --> 170.16
grapefruit juice still

168.239 --> 172.4
but i also got something special it

170.16 --> 176.64
wasn't in the discount

172.4 --> 179.92000000000002
at the uh the store so i got some

176.64 --> 183.2
very exotic juice uh it's once again

179.92 --> 186.39999999999998
mango and passion fruit so

183.2 --> 186.39999999999998
very very tropical

187.84 --> 191.20000000000002
put it in the cooler right before i

189.28 --> 195.2
started the show

191.2 --> 197.599
or yeah up until really nice

195.2 --> 199.2
and yeah i haven't really eaten yet

197.599 --> 202.48
since we're a little warm too

199.2 --> 203.83999999999997
so i got like a banana

202.48 --> 206.319
i thought that was probably going to be

203.84 --> 209.76
better than

206.319 --> 210.64
my regular diet which is kind of like

209.76 --> 213.04
high fat

210.64 --> 216.0
and protein and with this heat it's just

213.04 --> 216.0
not that pleasant

221.04 --> 224.959
right so let's see who is in chat i

223.2 --> 226.879

224.959 --> 228.64000000000001

let's check it

280.4 --> 285.03999999999996

282.24 --> 289.44
literally just stopped streaming so

285.04 --> 289.44
but i did watch a big chunk of it

289.68 --> 295.68
because i don't know the iron real media

293.199 --> 298.32
friday morning show tend to be kind of

295.68 --> 302.24

319.6 --> 326.639
the after show had rounded up

325.24 --> 329.28000000000003
[Music]

326.639 --> 330.479
right so okay i made some notes again

329.28 --> 333.84
since i completely

330.479 --> 335.12
forgot about that wednesday not too

333.84 --> 337.59999999999997
elaborate though

335.12 --> 338.32
i remember most of it i didn't really go

337.6 --> 341.759
out and do

338.32 --> 344.24
too much online

341.759 --> 345.6
right so anyway the uh early word show

344.24 --> 349.44
yesterday was pretty good

345.6 --> 349.84000000000003
i thought the flat earth debates were

349.44 --> 353.84
like

349.84 --> 353.84
really good this time

354.16 --> 359.28000000000003
you're getting a bit of music industry

356.08 --> 359.28
help really

359.36 --> 363.84000000000003
huh all right

364.84 --> 370.79999999999995
uh

366.16 --> 370.8
all right yeah

371.039 --> 374.08
anyway yeah yesterday was good on the

372.72 --> 377.28000000000003
flat earth debates and

374.08 --> 379.35999999999996
at some point nathan yeah was up against

377.28 --> 382.479
tchaiky first but he kind of like

379.36 --> 384.8
sunk back into the swamp as usual

382.479 --> 386.96
when you when you start to berate him

384.8 --> 387.68
for his stupidity and then ed took over

386.96 --> 391.44
and he just

387.68 --> 393.6
like really was trolling for

391.44 --> 395.36
an hour and nathan was just like really

393.6 --> 398.40000000000003
chewing that bone

395.36 --> 400.24
like really like really taking his time

398.4 --> 401.75899999999996
and we were all sitting there like

400.24 --> 404.08
that he's doing that he's doing that and

401.759 --> 407.199
nathan was just keeping it to the

404.08 --> 409.28
to reel to the baseline like the

407.199 --> 411.52000000000004
the base facts and i was like oh that

409.28 --> 413.75899999999996
but it's even worse it's even worse but

411.52 --> 415.44
we all had to shut up

413.759 --> 417.44
and every time somebody talked through

415.44 --> 417.919
he got really pissed off so i tried it

417.44 --> 422.08
like

417.919 --> 423.599
once and chocolate did it too and 10th

422.08 --> 425.12
man had desserts and

423.599 --> 426.88
we were all just sitting there like ah

425.12 --> 429.759
come on nathan stop chewing that bone

426.88 --> 429.759
give us a chew

430.319 --> 434.88
and eventually like after now he did

432.56 --> 438.24
like let it go and just

434.88 --> 441.039
let us do it because yeah

438.24 --> 443.759
ed was just making a complete idiot a

441.039 --> 445.919
complete fool of himself anyway

443.759 --> 448.40000000000003
uh he was driven in a corner he had

445.919 --> 449.44
nowhere to go and he just refused to

448.4 --> 453.67999999999995
concede

449.44 --> 453.68
and that's just pure petty

455.36 --> 461.599
yeah inability to be honest to yourself

460.24 --> 464.56
you know he could have just conceded

461.599 --> 466.4
like yeah i was wrong

464.56 --> 468.0
and then try from scratch but no he

466.4 --> 469.75899999999996
couldn't let it go he knew he was

468.0 --> 472.319
absolutely defeated but he wouldn't let

469.759 --> 472.319
it go like

473.12 --> 477.44
being very petty about it anyway yeah

475.599 --> 478.87899999999996
you know you guys most of you are just

477.44 --> 480.96
used to that from the flat earth debates

478.879 --> 483.52000000000004
by now from the ballers

480.96 --> 485.44
uh owen benjamin's life again was pretty

483.52 --> 487.35999999999996
funny

485.44 --> 490.16
and yeah there was this clip going

487.36 --> 490.16
around of the

491.12 --> 494.72
news takes out takeouts from news

494.16 --> 498.879
readers

494.72 --> 502.72
about the mask debate the mask debate

498.879 --> 506.47900000000004
the master base is well underway and

502.72 --> 510.319
everybody's uh joining in the mastermind

506.479 --> 512.56
yeah it was funny

510.319 --> 514.08
i don't know if you've seen that the

512.56 --> 515.8389999999999
masturbate

514.08 --> 517.6800000000001
apparently there's a masturbate thing

515.839 --> 520.0
going on

517.68 --> 521.68
and uh yeah if you say it quick enough

520.0 --> 523.44
then you start to hear something else

521.68 --> 526.3199999999999
into that

523.44 --> 529.36
and yet there were just like dozens and

526.32 --> 531.2
dozens of clips of people saying that

529.36 --> 532.5600000000001
and you yeah you would definitely hear

531.2 --> 535.6
that in that it was

532.56 --> 537.92
freaking hilarious

535.6 --> 541.12
it's really just the whole mass debate

537.92 --> 543.92
is really just a squirter's fest

541.12 --> 543.92
yeah exactly

544.56 --> 548.64
exactly hello by the way and matthew

547.44 --> 551.6
mitchell

548.64 --> 551.6
and julia pabin

552.16 --> 554.7199999999999
crochet

555.44 --> 565.0400000000001
so that happened

562.72 --> 565.0400000000001
uh

568.08 --> 571.44
and what else what else

571.839 --> 576.0
yeah we have been gaming a little bit

573.92 --> 578.0799999999999
more also yeah i like

576.0 --> 579.6
watching some alex jones in the

578.08 --> 580.72
background seeing what he's up to what

579.6 --> 584.08
type of guests he has

580.72 --> 585.44
apparently now it's uh it's a strategic

584.08 --> 587.44
location guy

585.44 --> 588.8000000000001
that's a pretty good book although it is

587.44 --> 591.12
very much also

588.8 --> 593.4399999999999
where is the safest place for when the

591.12 --> 596.48
nuclear war starts so

593.44 --> 599.36
but despite that that

596.48 --> 600.88
yeah thing in there i think it's still

599.36 --> 604.5600000000001
pretty good advice although

600.88 --> 606.72
i am not the expert but maybe

604.56 --> 608.0
i should ask mark sergeant he wrote a

606.72 --> 611.0400000000001
book about uh

608.0 --> 614.64
survival the survival guide

611.04 --> 617.8389999999999
so i wonder what he has to say about uh

614.64 --> 621.519
what's his name joel skousen

617.839 --> 621.519
book strategic relocation

621.76 --> 626.079
and he's very much a global i think

623.839 --> 626.0790000000001
although

626.24 --> 630.9590000000001
i don't know he might know and then just

628.64 --> 633.4399999999999
literally be part of the globe agenda in

630.959 --> 637.1999999999999
this case through

633.44 --> 639.44
through i don't know how that works

637.2 --> 639.44
uh

640.88 --> 646.32
but that's happening now and alex is

644.079 --> 647.76
advertising his dad's new toothpaste all

646.32 --> 649.9200000000001
the time

647.76 --> 651.36
typical i'm probably going to try it out

649.92 --> 654.88
at some point like that but

651.36 --> 657.519
i already made my order for for

654.88 --> 658.8389999999999
for a while don't really have any money

657.519 --> 661.68
for that kind of

658.839 --> 663.839
thing now anymore

661.68 --> 664.7199999999999
not until like the year is over and then

663.839 --> 669.9200000000001
we'll see

664.72 --> 672.839
what i'm gonna do with that uh

669.92 --> 674.88
right also did some more combat chanting

672.839 --> 677.2
today

674.88 --> 679.4399999999999
and it worked again and it's really

677.2 --> 681.9200000000001
funny now because

679.44 --> 682.5600000000001
i explained it very carefully yesterday

681.92 --> 685.5999999999999
like oh

682.56 --> 686.16
yeah when i feel all vengeful and all

685.6 --> 688.48
that

686.16 --> 691.12
from harry man that's how i see it

688.48 --> 693.36
influence that i don't really like

691.12 --> 694.8
and then the muttering like trying to

693.36 --> 696.64
chant and then it's basically

694.8 --> 699.3599999999999
non-effective well i really

696.64 --> 700.64
since i pushed it out like i explained

699.36 --> 704.399
yesterday

700.64 --> 707.12
now that is set now every time

704.399 --> 708.48
i think about saying it it is pulled out

707.12 --> 711.279
like that so it's almost

708.48 --> 711.76
automatically becoming a combat chant as

711.279 --> 714.8
somebody

711.76 --> 715.8389999999999
deemed it and it's so much more

714.8 --> 719.279
effective now it's

715.839 --> 720.8800000000001
it's interesting it's very interesting

719.279 --> 725.92
to me that suddenly that has

720.88 --> 728.959
changed and also at the same time i'm

725.92 --> 730.8
really in my mind and soul and hard

728.959 --> 732.88
thinking again about the dark world

730.8 --> 737.4399999999999
experience and my reflection on

732.88 --> 739.279
how is it all a lie like how did it work

737.44 --> 741.2790000000001
and because of the different there was

739.279 --> 745.079
such

741.279 --> 748.0
there were different layers of

745.079 --> 750.6389999999999
experiencing things

748.0 --> 752.24
it's basically like different angles to

750.639 --> 757.04
the

752.24 --> 760.9590000000001
to the same thing

757.04 --> 765.279
so with some it had very distinct

760.959 --> 768.3199999999999
landscape features even

765.279 --> 772.32
yeah it's like it was rocky and

768.32 --> 774.5600000000001
there was sand i didn't see a single

772.32 --> 779.0400000000001
plant in there

774.56 --> 781.3599999999999
and i think the sky was stormy

779.04 --> 782.639
so that i don't know but every time that

781.36 --> 786.0
i saw that part

782.639 --> 789.92
it just reminded me of hell like it

786.0 --> 791.92
wasn't literally like to dante's inferno

789.92 --> 794.4799999999999
type of hell

791.92 --> 796.7199999999999
but like the atmosphere there was just

794.48 --> 800.0
very grim

796.72 --> 803.36
and and it's also been

800.0 --> 804.959
part of the whole thing like fragments

803.36 --> 808.16
of that fragments of

804.959 --> 811.279
experiences that weren't mines fragments

808.16 --> 813.68
of virtual emulations

811.279 --> 816.0
of things that in my real in my real

813.68 --> 818.079
world experience i've seen

816.0 --> 819.279
basically like oh i watched the scene in

818.079 --> 822.3199999999999
the movie and then

819.279 --> 824.079
those freaking entities out there that

822.32 --> 827.279
were [ __ ] around with me

824.079 --> 829.8389999999999
they basically created a 3d

827.279 --> 831.8389999999999
simulation of the situation and put me

829.839 --> 834.8000000000001
in character roles

831.839 --> 835.9200000000001
kind of to torture me because yeah i'm

834.8 --> 839.279
figuring this out

835.92 --> 842.7199999999999
every single time now every time i get

839.279 --> 844.88
got one of those experiences it was

842.72 --> 847.1990000000001
really to demoralize me at the time but

844.88 --> 847.6
i didn't really fell for it but it still

847.199 --> 849.92
has

847.6 --> 851.9200000000001
drained me it was very it was

849.92 --> 855.04
demoralizing it didn't break me

851.92 --> 857.4399999999999
spiritually because i

855.04 --> 859.279
did figure out that it wasn't really me

857.44 --> 861.12
it was just getting really confusing

859.279 --> 863.76
after a long time

861.12 --> 865.76
but yeah they placed me in these roles

863.76 --> 868.079
and then i'm seeing these roles back i'm

865.76 --> 869.04
basically seeing this scenario that i

868.079 --> 872.16
experienced through

869.04 --> 872.16
first person vision

872.24 --> 875.839
i'm seeing it on my screen from another

874.639 --> 878.9590000000001
vision i'm seeing like

875.839 --> 881.7600000000001
damn that's i experienced that from

878.959 --> 885.76
first person perspective

881.76 --> 888.48
that's crazy and also makes a lot more

885.76 --> 891.68
sense why it didn't make any sense to me

888.48 --> 893.6
at the time so that's part of it you

891.68 --> 895.92
talking about dreams no it's not dreams

893.6 --> 898.0790000000001
it's not dreams it's a thing that i

895.92 --> 901.199
experienced a long time ago

898.079 --> 904.399
this is a giant vision

901.199 --> 907.76
where i think they probably

904.399 --> 910.0
just abused my natural foresight

907.76 --> 912.88
abilities and kind of like squirt

910.0 --> 914.399
squirted it all out at the same time to

912.88 --> 917.279
try and break me

914.399 --> 918.56
or to dim down that ability because i

917.279 --> 920.88
was seen as a

918.56 --> 920.88
threat

922.959 --> 926.2399999999999
right and all those experience have

924.48 --> 929.759
stuck to me because

926.24 --> 933.04
probably they were not from that moment

929.759 --> 934.16
they were from the moments now and they

933.04 --> 936.079
were distorted

934.16 --> 938.56
and then displaced on my earlier

936.079 --> 938.56
conscious

938.88 --> 942.32
that's what i think roughly what

940.32 --> 944.639
happened

942.32 --> 945.6800000000001
i don't care to ever experience anything

944.639 --> 947.92
like that again for

945.68 --> 949.199
any reason and that's also becoming more

947.92 --> 952.7199999999999
clear and clear and clear

949.199 --> 955.92
like really that i wonder even like

952.72 --> 958.0790000000001
what it was it should probably inquire

955.92 --> 958.079
with

958.88 --> 962.56
some serious shamanic people about that

961.759 --> 965.6800000000001
that are like

962.56 --> 969.8389999999999
really high tier to understand

965.68 --> 969.8389999999999
just what the [ __ ] happened

971.36 --> 980.0790000000001
anyway but this is all a long time ago

975.519 --> 982.0
for me now it feels like a lifetime ago

980.079 --> 983.7589999999999
yeah praise jesus for the healing well

982.0 --> 986.32
it's basically the frequency

983.759 --> 987.279
it's i have no choice it's the only

986.32 --> 990.24
viable

987.279 --> 990.24
source of life

991.12 --> 996.0
it's the only refreshment in the whole

994.839 --> 1000.48
thing

996.0 --> 1003.519
the energy the frequency the the

1000.48 --> 1003.519
understanding of it

1008.8 --> 1013.8389999999999
vision whilst awake no i can't really

1012.24 --> 1016.9590000000001
say

1013.839 --> 1021.12
does it matter if i experience 80 years

1016.959 --> 1021.1199999999999
of consecutive experience time

1021.199 --> 1027.12
in a singular moment of a minute

1024.319 --> 1030.559
is that awake can that be awake does

1027.12 --> 1030.559
that make any [ __ ] sense

1034.559 --> 1038.3999999999999
study the word and it has its own that

1036.799 --> 1039.9189999999999
yeah that was my point agm

1038.4 --> 1043.3600000000001
oh by the way thank you good servant for

1039.919 --> 1043.3600000000001
the dollar super chat donation

1046.88 --> 1051.2800000000002
yeah george sanford son does good work

1049.44 --> 1053.8400000000001
of healing and growing it's also very

1051.28 --> 1053.84
hot

1055.039 --> 1059.52
the day like during this time period

1064.84 --> 1067.84
here

1082.4 --> 1086.96
okay rochimaru that sounds interesting

1092.96 --> 1101.6000000000001
right anyway i i don't even want to

1096.48 --> 1101.6
get too much into it really it's just

1104.96 --> 1112.72
what i'm mostly trying to do

1108.559 --> 1112.72
and i don't know if it's even possible

1114.24 --> 1118.4
it sounds really odd i'm trying to

1117.2 --> 1121.3600000000001
communicate with

1118.4 --> 1123.6000000000001
my older self in ways like even some of

1121.36 --> 1126.8799999999999
the rage i kind of tend to address

1123.6 --> 1129.4399999999998
him me me from the past

1126.88 --> 1130.96
kind of because rage did draw my

1129.44 --> 1134.16
attention

1130.96 --> 1137.28
but i was just like artificially naive

1134.16 --> 1141.039
kept like i could not learn i

1137.28 --> 1144.3999999999999
could not learn

1141.039 --> 1146.32
from things

1144.4 --> 1147.6000000000001
i could only interpret it by the

1146.32 --> 1150.6399999999999
standards that

1147.6 --> 1153.1999999999998
i had were

1150.64 --> 1154.3200000000002
holding at the time and that's like a

1153.2 --> 1156.48
big problem

1154.32 --> 1157.4399999999998
so what i'm basically trying to do as an

1156.48 --> 1159.679
outsider

1157.44 --> 1162.559
perspective addressing my former self

1159.679 --> 1165.2
which is absolutely nothing like me now

1162.559 --> 1166.24
totally unreasonable very deluded in

1165.2 --> 1169.6000000000001
many ways like

1166.24 --> 1171.919
bad and

1169.6 --> 1173.84
trying to basically tell him like stop

1171.919 --> 1178.5590000000002
the longer you

1173.84 --> 1182.1599999999999
go forward look there

1178.559 --> 1185.2
the more it's ruining things

1182.16 --> 1193.38
for for me for you for you in the future

1185.2 --> 1196.0
and any notion delusion

1193.38 --> 1198.5590000000002
[Music]

1196.0 --> 1200.48
and i kind of did but i really i'm just

1198.559 --> 1203.84
trying to force it through to make

1200.48 --> 1206.96
him stop and wake up

1203.84 --> 1207.4399999999998
and here's the weird part all right i do

1206.96 --> 1209.52
have a

1207.44 --> 1211.2
memory of when it stopped when i stepped

1209.52 --> 1213.679
out you know what that was

1211.2 --> 1214.64
me literally walking into the ovens of

1213.679 --> 1218.24
hell

1214.64 --> 1221.919
or the spirit thing i was

1218.24 --> 1224.88
and like the sense of ultimate defeat

1221.919 --> 1225.5200000000002
and i'm basically trying to like ah get

1224.88 --> 1229.88
in there

1225.52 --> 1234.4
now get the [ __ ] out of here

1229.88 --> 1237.8400000000001
disintegrate stop end

1234.4 --> 1239.52
and now i want to be free

1237.84 --> 1241.12
i want to be free of the freaking

1239.52 --> 1244.8799999999999
delusion

1241.12 --> 1248.2399999999998
that that was so get out of here

1244.88 --> 1251.6000000000001
and leave me the [ __ ] alone let me

1248.24 --> 1254.96
ascend from an earthly

1251.6 --> 1259.28
vantage point let me ascend in spirit

1254.96 --> 1261.8400000000001
here on earth in what god has entrusted

1259.28 --> 1263.44
to man this is where we're supposed to

1261.84 --> 1265.12
do things this is where we're supposed

1263.44 --> 1266.0
to learn this is where we're supposed to

1265.12 --> 1270.6399999999999
suffer

1266.0 --> 1274.0
and this is where we're supposed to grow

1270.64 --> 1277.919
grow food grow offspring

1274.0 --> 1279.919
grow wisdom don't forget about that one

1277.919 --> 1281.3600000000001
very important you gotta grow it it's

1279.919 --> 1284.72
something you have to

1281.36 --> 1287.28
work on and

1284.72 --> 1289.039
you do it by overcoming the toughest

1287.28 --> 1290.8799999999999
obstacles inside of you

1289.039 --> 1293.2
the ones you don't even want to know

1290.88 --> 1293.2
exist

1294.24 --> 1296.48
right

1297.01 --> 1305.84
[Music]

1299.28 --> 1305.84
so yeah let's see

1307.28 --> 1312.32
yeah see we got some trolls here and

1309.6 --> 1312.32
don't really care

1314.93 --> 1319.8400000000001
[Music]

1316.84 --> 1319.84
uh

1320.799 --> 1325.2
storm i say yes what

1331.84 --> 1347.84
upward cloud

1334.88 --> 1347.8400000000001
all right

1348.24 --> 1353.52
no no nobody's going to move any

1351.44 --> 1356.559
distance apart

1353.52 --> 1358.08
i i don't even want to talk about it i'm

1356.559 --> 1361.36
sick of the masturbate

1358.08 --> 1363.76
i'm sick of it i'm sick of the jokes i

1361.36 --> 1364.559
understand that certain people basically

1363.76 --> 1368.559
have no

1364.559 --> 1370.799
choice but to continue

1368.559 --> 1373.12
blabbering on about the freaking mask

1370.799 --> 1375.039
because every [ __ ] person in the

1373.12 --> 1377.6
world is under the spell of it

1375.039 --> 1378.48
and a lot of them of the really dumb

1377.6 --> 1381.84
people

1378.48 --> 1384.88
are also waking up to that it's a fraud

1381.84 --> 1388.72
here's a little problem though despite

1384.88 --> 1390.0800000000002
it being so brutally obvious and still a

1388.72 --> 1392.559
big part of people

1390.08 --> 1393.36
that are [ __ ] actually figuring that

1392.559 --> 1395.6789999999999
out

1393.36 --> 1396.6399999999999
it doesn't actually give them skill and

1395.679 --> 1399.6000000000001
faculties to

1396.64 --> 1400.88
understand [ __ ] things okay so

1399.6 --> 1403.4399999999998
they're just like oh

1400.88 --> 1405.8400000000001
yeah now i wanna hear all day how

1403.44 --> 1408.24
everybody's telling me the mask is fake

1405.84 --> 1410.48
hey let's talk all day long about how

1408.24 --> 1417.84
the [ __ ] mask is fake it's so

1410.48 --> 1417.84
useless way to spend your time

1418.24 --> 1426.08
stop masturbating

1422.24 --> 1426.08
stop masturbating

1426.48 --> 1434.559
really get it out get it out of your

1429.76 --> 1434.559
spirit it's fake

1434.88 --> 1442.3200000000002
get it out don't think about it

1438.4 --> 1445.8400000000001
don't look at it don't feel anything

1442.32 --> 1450.3999999999999
about it or people wearing masks just

1445.84 --> 1452.799
forget it it's gonna go away

1450.4 --> 1454.3200000000002
and completely moving it out of your

1452.799 --> 1457.2
mind will not be

1454.32 --> 1457.6
detrimental in any way we already know

1457.2 --> 1460.799
that

1457.6 --> 1461.6789999999999
strategically we already know how it

1460.799 --> 1464.96
works so just

1461.679 --> 1467.6000000000001
stop talking about the freaking masks

1464.96 --> 1470.0
and about social distancing and about

1467.6 --> 1473.84
the [ __ ] media blabbering on about

1470.0 --> 1473.84
that for all eternity

1484.84 --> 1490.8799999999999
anyway

1487.52 --> 1492.96
yeah and that's i'm mostly addressing

1490.88 --> 1495.7600000000002
people in my chat right now

1492.96 --> 1497.6000000000001
because as i already said i understand

1495.76 --> 1499.36
there's just other channels out there

1497.6 --> 1501.6
they don't really know what else the

1499.36 --> 1502.3999999999999
[ __ ] to do they just have to talk about

1501.6 --> 1504.3999999999999
masks

1502.4 --> 1505.76
everybody's talking about masks hey they

1504.4 --> 1507.919
want a show

1505.76 --> 1509.279
they've learned things about masks that

1507.919 --> 1510.7990000000002
they want to share

1509.279 --> 1512.48
and people want to hear it so we're

1510.799 --> 1514.799
going to talk about the mask today

1512.48 --> 1518.559
masturbation for all eternity

1514.799 --> 1518.559
well i'm not going to be part of that

1524.72 --> 1530.64
just in general really glad that nathan

1528.08 --> 1531.52
at least completely excludes that [ __ ]

1530.64 --> 1534.64
from his show

1531.52 --> 1536.8799999999999
so happy so unbelievably happy he did

1534.64 --> 1536.88
that

1538.24 --> 1542.64
and in the same level on the same level

1540.4 --> 1545.279
actually when i think about that

1542.64 --> 1546.48
i even kind of agree that he refuses to

1545.279 --> 1549.679
talk about 5g

1546.48 --> 1550.96
things as well now i'm not going to

1549.679 --> 1552.88
completely

1550.96 --> 1554.159
refuse to talk about that because there

1552.88 --> 1556.3200000000002
is just more

1554.159 --> 1557.5200000000002
development there and there is real

1556.32 --> 1561.4399999999998
threats there

1557.52 --> 1564.72
that's all real it's just probably not

1561.44 --> 1564.72
as exaggerated

1565.039 --> 1570.08
as it has become but it's still a

1568.72 --> 1573.76
legitimate threat and it

1570.08 --> 1577.039
is being planned to that threat

1573.76 --> 1579.84
is has been planned into the plan

1577.039 --> 1581.039
i'm absolutely sure of it hundred

1579.84 --> 1584.8799999999999
percent

1581.039 --> 1587.279
sure hundred percent

1584.88 --> 1588.3200000000002
i know it's going to be that doesn't

1587.279 --> 1590.96
mean that it's that

1588.32 --> 1593.52
right now it's going to be used though

1590.96 --> 1593.52
it is

1594.48 --> 1598.0
no doubt in my mind and that's why i

1596.64 --> 1601.8400000000001
kind of basically put

1598.0 --> 1606.24
my foot on the brake officially with 5g

1601.84 --> 1609.6
i said no nobody needs that no body

1606.24 --> 1611.76
but a bunch of freaking idiot yuppies

1609.6 --> 1614.7199999999998
with their mobile phones that want the

1611.76 --> 1619.279
internet to be more faster everywhere

1614.72 --> 1619.279
because they're [ __ ] lazy stupid

1624.84 --> 1627.84
uh

1634.559 --> 1642.559
right uh so

1638.84 --> 1645.76
anything you guys

1642.559 --> 1647.9189999999999
be interested in me talking about

1645.76 --> 1650.96
besides the things that i obviously

1647.919 --> 1650.96
don't want to talk about

1652.84 --> 1655.84
no

1658.399 --> 1664.4799999999998
now they're definitely not producing

1661.6 --> 1667.1999999999998
symbols and patterns in this guy hm

1664.48 --> 1670.32
absolutely not

1667.2 --> 1670.32
doesn't mean anything

1671.76 --> 1676.32
no it's the same necklace i've been

1673.919 --> 1678.0800000000002
wearing for two years every single day

1676.32 --> 1683.84
the fuzzler

1678.08 --> 1683.84
every single day

1684.32 --> 1687.76
what is the show title what is the show

1686.399 --> 1689.6789999999999
title

1687.76 --> 1690.96
right the smoky torch is running out of

1689.679 --> 1694.159
fat

1690.96 --> 1696.799
yeah yeah it's a bigger picture analysis

1694.159 --> 1698.64
metaphorical analysis based also on

1696.799 --> 1700.48
owen benjamin talking about the torch of

1698.64 --> 1702.24
lucifer just don't take the torch it's

1700.48 --> 1705.3600000000001
very bright it's

1702.24 --> 1708.48
although he refuses to call it smokey

1705.36 --> 1712.0
and i definitely will and yeah

1708.48 --> 1713.679
that torch even though there's still a

1712.0 --> 1717.2
lot of money

1713.679 --> 1720.799
in from physical perspective behind it

1717.2 --> 1723.52
it's running out of fat and the fat

1720.799 --> 1724.6399999999999
human fat that it burns off and it's

1723.52 --> 1727.12
running out

1724.64 --> 1728.64
because the whole foundation for it to

1727.12 --> 1731.12
continue working

1728.64 --> 1732.5590000000002
is being disrupted it's going to be

1731.12 --> 1734.6399999999999
further disrupted

1732.559 --> 1736.08
and it's basically it's lucifer's time

1734.64 --> 1739.76
to

1736.08 --> 1741.84
to retract to retreat

1739.76 --> 1743.36
and he's gonna take that stupid smokey

1741.84 --> 1746.559
torch with him

1743.36 --> 1748.6399999999999
it's already going out slowly because

1746.559 --> 1753.52
yeah it's running out of fat

1748.64 --> 1756.5590000000002
it's running out of fat to burn

1753.52 --> 1759.44
have you ever seen like uh

1756.559 --> 1760.96
torches that do run on actual fat like

1759.44 --> 1763.8400000000001
pig fat or that

1760.96 --> 1764.96
they existed yeah they burn they burn

1763.84 --> 1768.1589999999999
pretty well

1764.96 --> 1771.44
they smell and they smoke oh

1768.159 --> 1771.44
yeah do they smoke

1772.24 --> 1775.279
so yeah

1775.52 --> 1781.84
i like yeah i think that metaphor is

1777.6 --> 1781.84
better this is

1783.039 --> 1790.64
darwinian improvement of the concept

1786.32 --> 1790.6399999999999
so smoky torch is running out of fat

1790.799 --> 1795.76
and yeah we'll see where that's gonna go

1792.88 --> 1798.7990000000002
i think there's just uh the the

1795.76 --> 1799.84
i think the open satanic gang that the

1798.799 --> 1803.76
ones that are just

1799.84 --> 1806.9599999999998
really overtly trying to convert

1803.76 --> 1810.0
the western society to to to true

1806.96 --> 1811.679
satanism to disgusting behavior

1810.0 --> 1813.279
reversing it all around i think that

1811.679 --> 1816.799
that is kind of like

1813.279 --> 1819.679
it's they overplayed their hand and it's

1816.799 --> 1823.84
gonna run out

1819.679 --> 1823.8400000000001
the polarization is aggravating

1825.679 --> 1831.279
the torch is burning but the fat supply

1828.799 --> 1833.279
for the torch has run is running out

1831.279 --> 1835.44
they probably still have plenty of

1833.279 --> 1837.279
people under contract to keep it going

1835.44 --> 1840.96
for a while

1837.279 --> 1844.559
but they're all all struggling all

1840.96 --> 1847.44
yeah drying out their fat is running out

1844.559 --> 1848.32
and so the torch will stop burning at

1847.44 --> 1851.8400000000001
some point

1848.32 --> 1851.84
i know it will

1856.799 --> 1860.24
claim self-worship yeah sure

1858.799 --> 1864.08
self-worship

1860.24 --> 1868.72
entity worship alien worship

1864.08 --> 1872.8799999999999
a personification of a certain religion

1868.72 --> 1875.6000000000001
worship that actually results into

1872.88 --> 1876.72
yeah promoting behavior that's not

1875.6 --> 1880.32
promoted by the

1876.72 --> 1880.96
original figure or actions a way to go

1880.32 --> 1883.039
about that

1880.96 --> 1885.039
absolutely do not agree with the

1883.039 --> 1889.2
teachings of the original figure

1885.039 --> 1893.84
right that all of that all of it

1889.2 --> 1893.8400000000001
yeah see

1896.159 --> 1899.919
yeah i've been watching uh continuing

1898.559 --> 1903.12
watching glitch by the way

1899.919 --> 1904.3200000000002
in the third season i'm like two more

1903.12 --> 1906.4799999999998
episodes

1904.32 --> 1910.1589999999999
but like there was this situation there

1906.48 --> 1910.159
and it's very typical and

1911.039 --> 1915.039
tough for me but there was yeah there's

1914.0 --> 1917.84
a

1915.039 --> 1919.279
situation in there with a very very

1917.84 --> 1922.0
christian family

1919.279 --> 1923.76
i think it's like a jehovah's witness

1922.0 --> 1926.48
type of family

1923.76 --> 1927.679
very big in like a big wooden house and

1926.48 --> 1931.679
they were all

1927.679 --> 1934.5590000000002
like really fundamentally

1931.679 --> 1935.6000000000001
christian but like with complete

1934.559 --> 1938.72
hysteria

1935.6 --> 1942.08
and just not yeah

1938.72 --> 1944.799
fatal solutions it's stupid like really

1942.08 --> 1946.08
the stupidest worst form of christian

1944.799 --> 1948.0
that i

1946.08 --> 1949.6
ever been confronted with and that thing

1948.0 --> 1951.2
is real

1949.6 --> 1952.8799999999999
there have been people or they're

1951.2 --> 1956.559
probably still out there that are

1952.88 --> 1956.5590000000002
like that and they're just

1958.72 --> 1962.08
i don't even want to say it it's just

1961.039 --> 1963.919
wrong

1962.08 --> 1965.12
they're dumb they're not learning

1963.919 --> 1966.96
anything

1965.12 --> 1969.039
they're just following a code that they

1966.96 --> 1971.279
don't freaking understand they barely

1969.039 --> 1974.32
understand it

1971.279 --> 1976.32
and yeah it annoyed the [ __ ] out of me

1974.32 --> 1978.48
and even the figure that was there

1976.32 --> 1979.36
annoyed the [ __ ] out of me because yeah

1978.48 --> 1982.3990000000001
she was

1979.36 --> 1983.279
raised like that completely naive she

1982.399 --> 1986.0
would literally

1983.279 --> 1987.919
walk into her own death because she

1986.0 --> 1990.559
couldn't handle

1987.919 --> 1992.64
that maybe her family was actually

1990.559 --> 1994.32
[ __ ] insane

1992.64 --> 1995.679
couldn't handle the situation that

1994.32 --> 1996.0
happened to her neither could she and

1995.679 --> 1998.96
that

1996.0 --> 1999.679
just aggravated me badly didn't like

1998.96 --> 2001.919
that

1999.679 --> 2003.039
by the way it was a yeah it was kind of

2001.919 --> 2005.76
a good point in there

2003.039 --> 2007.12
yeah again the original my criticism on

2005.76 --> 2010.32
christianity is is

2007.12 --> 2011.76
that it's the freaking idiots

2010.32 --> 2014.32
idiots that don't know what the [ __ ]

2011.76 --> 2014.32
they're doing

2016.48 --> 2022.96
yeah and they can keep on breeding

2019.84 --> 2026.08
they will probably be decent farmers

2022.96 --> 2026.96
but they're what are they learning they

2026.08 --> 2029.36
barely even

2026.96 --> 2030.799
are capable of overcoming their own

2029.36 --> 2032.8799999999999
mistakes because they just

2030.799 --> 2034.1589999999999
solve everything for peer pressure

2032.88 --> 2038.3990000000001
[ __ ]

2034.159 --> 2038.3990000000001
everything it's terrible

2038.88 --> 2045.1200000000001
it's like a collective system on its own

2042.08 --> 2047.6789999999999
and everybody becomes freaking dumb i

2045.12 --> 2050.72
hate it

2047.679 --> 2052.96
not christian in my opinion not really

2050.72 --> 2055.1189999999997
not the real spirit of christ what the

2052.96 --> 2057.28
whole message was the real meaning of

2055.119 --> 2061.839
creation itself

2057.28 --> 2061.8390000000004
they don't get any of it

2062.72 --> 2068.24
so yeah that that

2065.839 --> 2068.24
happened

2072.96 --> 2076.399
and the rest series yeah it's

2074.56 --> 2077.839
interesting it's really it is kind of

2076.399 --> 2080.24
running out there is like a

2077.839 --> 2083.04
more doomsday scenario in there there

2080.24 --> 2085.919
was also a scene that was just really

2083.04 --> 2089.2
annoying stupid techno babble [ __ ]

2085.919 --> 2092.6389999999997
based on heliocentric garbage

2089.2 --> 2097.359
and that was like okay you know

2092.639 --> 2102.0
in uh what is it is it

2097.359 --> 2103.92
in dark the the time

2102.0 --> 2106.0
series the german time series yeah they

2103.92 --> 2109.04
had some time

2106.0 --> 2110.8
uh technobabble gadgeteering in there

2109.04 --> 2112.24
but it was actually halfway decent it

2110.8 --> 2113.92
was just about yeah they

2112.24 --> 2115.68
thought einstein in there and they were

2113.92 --> 2117.92
really trying to reify the

2115.68 --> 2119.839
pseudo-romanian force pace indirectly

2117.92 --> 2122.64
through time and all that

2119.839 --> 2123.2799999999997
but that's still like okay in this one

2122.64 --> 2125.48
no they

2123.28 --> 2126.96
at the end start to blurt out this

2125.48 --> 2131.359
heliocentric

2126.96 --> 2132.7200000000003
garbage garbage it's the dumbest [ __ ]

2131.359 --> 2135.839
thing i've ever heard

2132.72 --> 2138.7999999999997
a total bummer to the serie

2135.839 --> 2140.72
i really had like woman shut the [ __ ] up

2138.8 --> 2143.92
you stupid

2140.72 --> 2146.16
[ __ ] she was a [ __ ] baller baller

2143.92 --> 2150.0
[ __ ]

2146.16 --> 2153.359
you say like oh dark matter and

2150.0 --> 2156.48
yeah and then because this happened

2153.359 --> 2159.7599999999998
well the very fabric of

2156.48 --> 2162.079
basically natural law will unravel sorry

2159.76 --> 2163.3590000000004
it did not work for me i thought it was

2162.079 --> 2166.0
[ __ ] dumb

2163.359 --> 2169.2799999999997
it was [ __ ] stupid they should have

2166.0 --> 2169.28
just left it biblical

2169.68 --> 2173.839
they really should have instead of

2172.0 --> 2177.52
pouring out this heliocentric

2173.839 --> 2179.359
garbage explanation that nobody

2177.52 --> 2181.44
nobody's gonna take that series that has

2179.359 --> 2184.3199999999997
half a brain

2181.44 --> 2187.839
it's just sci-fi mumbo jumbo that kind

2184.32 --> 2187.839
of ruined the whole thing

2195.52 --> 2200.56
yeah i don't care if it's fiction or not

2198.4 --> 2201.6800000000003
it's a stupid thing they put in there

2200.56 --> 2206.48
that's completely

2201.68 --> 2209.2799999999997
useless it it takes away

2206.48 --> 2209.92
the deeper meaning spiritual things

2209.28 --> 2213.8390000000004
about it

2209.92 --> 2217.2000000000003
because it's based on absolute

2213.839 --> 2219.2
hollowed out garbage that is absolutely

2217.2 --> 2223.4399999999996
with great certainty

2219.2 --> 2226.8799999999997
not real and stupid to put it in there

2223.44 --> 2228.2400000000002
i should have just stuck to the biblical

2226.88 --> 2230.1600000000003
approach much

2228.24 --> 2231.4399999999996
much more interest and they they do keep

2230.16 --> 2233.44
it in there people have their own

2231.44 --> 2235.839
interpretations

2233.44 --> 2237.68
but this techno babble [ __ ] was

2235.839 --> 2239.2799999999997
introduced there and then correlated

2237.68 --> 2242.64
with certain sightings to

2239.28 --> 2245.6800000000003
basically reified as real on the spot

2242.64 --> 2249.2
and it was the worst

2245.68 --> 2250.96
that's like stephen spielberg kids movie

2249.2 --> 2254.0789999999997
level plot device it's

2250.96 --> 2255.68
stupid you know in a steven spielberg

2254.079 --> 2258.079
movie or whatever

2255.68 --> 2259.5989999999997
or not that all steven spielberg movies

2258.079 --> 2262.7200000000003
are terrible

2259.599 --> 2263.839
but yeah those movies you expect that in

2262.72 --> 2266.8799999999997
a in a very

2263.839 --> 2268.7999999999997
in a character driven sci-fi series you

2266.88 --> 2272.0
don't want that [ __ ]

2268.8 --> 2273.2000000000003
because it's not about that it's just

2272.0 --> 2276.96
stupid

2273.2 --> 2279.839
so yeah it was a big bummer but

2276.96 --> 2280.16
still the rest of the series i think is

2279.839 --> 2282.32
still

2280.16 --> 2285.2799999999997
very interesting and the characters are

2282.32 --> 2288.1600000000003
just fascinating and

2285.28 --> 2289.3590000000004
and they do develop they're real

2288.16 --> 2292.48
characters i like it

2289.359 --> 2292.48
like that anyway

2292.64 --> 2298.0789999999997
but i'm running uh yeah running out of

2295.839 --> 2300.0
glitch episodes and it's probably gonna

2298.079 --> 2301.3590000000004
end after the season after season three

2300.0 --> 2303.28
i think

2301.359 --> 2305.2
it's like building towards an end point

2303.28 --> 2310.4
so

2305.2 --> 2310.3999999999996
um it could be no

2310.839 --> 2313.839
thanks

2318.72 --> 2323.359
don't forget to pay your fine on the way

2321.04 --> 2323.359
what

2324.0 --> 2327.839
what are you talking about

2337.04 --> 2341.359
accept christ and then you will be

2339.04 --> 2345.119
baptized uh

2341.359 --> 2345.119
what i don't even know what that means

2349.599 --> 2353.28
solid show recommendations yeah flat

2352.079 --> 2356.6400000000003
earth debates

2353.28 --> 2360.48
i'm a part of it and my show

2356.64 --> 2360.48
i definitely recommend my show

2361.599 --> 2366.0
although yeah my show is something

2363.44 --> 2367.52
you're gonna have to deal with me

2366.0 --> 2370.079
you're gonna have to deal with listening

2367.52 --> 2371.68
to me blabber on about my life if that's

2370.079 --> 2373.2000000000003
like a little too personal for you you

2371.68 --> 2376.72
don't like it tough luck

2373.2 --> 2379.5989999999997
it's in there but if you

2376.72 --> 2382.16
really want to know about cosmogeny then

2379.599 --> 2383.04
just wait until that is addressed until

2382.16 --> 2385.7599999999998
i expand

2383.04 --> 2386.24
upon my ideas in that department and

2385.76 --> 2390.5600000000004
then

2386.24 --> 2393.68
pay attention really pay attention

2390.56 --> 2396.48
word for word

2393.68 --> 2398.0789999999997
because it's tough stuff that i deal

2396.48 --> 2401.839
with

2398.079 --> 2404.7200000000003
and you need to basically learn it

2401.839 --> 2405.92
study it like you would study a really

2404.72 --> 2408.8799999999997
complicated

2405.92 --> 2410.7200000000003
technical book you have to study what i

2408.88 --> 2412.1600000000003
say about it in order to get it i think

2410.72 --> 2412.9599999999996
that's the only way it's going to work

2412.16 --> 2414.56
because

2412.96 --> 2416.96
yeah there's plenty of people hanging

2414.56 --> 2418.0
around and like oh yeah this sounds

2416.96 --> 2420.4
interesting

2418.0 --> 2421.2
but they can barely even feed back what

2420.4 --> 2425.28
i'm saying

2421.2 --> 2427.4399999999996
when i ask them to

2425.28 --> 2428.4
and by the way that freaking includes

2427.44 --> 2430.96
nathan

2428.4 --> 2432.079
and qe and people that are really well

2430.96 --> 2435.28
studied they

2432.079 --> 2437.8390000000004
have trouble even following what i'm

2435.28 --> 2439.28
doing sometimes in my conceptualizations

2437.839 --> 2441.2
they get it when i

2439.28 --> 2445.0400000000004
approach it from a baller perspective

2441.2 --> 2445.04
and i make that very clear when i do

2445.359 --> 2451.2
but yeah my show is not they're not

2449.359 --> 2454.0789999999997
watching my show

2451.2 --> 2455.7599999999998
okay nathan is not watching my show he's

2454.079 --> 2458.8
not

2455.76 --> 2460.6400000000003
and qe definitely isn't watching my show

2458.8 --> 2463.6800000000003
but it's way too early for him and

2460.64 --> 2465.44
he can't stand my blabbering he doesn't

2463.68 --> 2468.48
like that he's

2465.44 --> 2471.44
he doesn't like like the the real

2468.48 --> 2472.48
personal confrontation out in the open

2471.44 --> 2475.359
kind of

2472.48 --> 2476.319
thing like that he's an old-fashioned

2475.359 --> 2478.0
guy

2476.319 --> 2479.92
a sleeping warrior you do watch me

2478.0 --> 2484.0
that's i know that

2479.92 --> 2484.0
yeah but you you really study

2484.079 --> 2495.8390000000004
fake irwin what are you talking about

2500.24 --> 2505.04
are you talking about this guy that he

2502.64 --> 2523.839
says he's your brother

2505.04 --> 2523.839
is he emmanuel

2524.24 --> 2529.04
a man that's jung that guy in chat

2527.52 --> 2531.44
is he here brother he said he's your

2529.04 --> 2531.44
brother

2533.04 --> 2538.72
he could of course also be that stalker

2535.359 --> 2538.72
you were talking about earlier

2538.88 --> 2543.44
so i just wanted to know so you can

2541.359 --> 2546.88
confirm that

2543.44 --> 2551.839
yes all right all right

2546.88 --> 2551.839
okay good to know

2566.4 --> 2579.839
i don't know what that means foreign

2588.96 --> 2592.8
greater shaping runs you the wrong way i

2591.76 --> 2596.8
think

2592.8 --> 2598.6400000000003
he rubs i don't think he runs but

2596.8 --> 2600.0
yeah he rubs a lot of people the wrong

2598.64 --> 2603.44
way for

2600.0 --> 2605.28
obvious reasons hey dank yeah good to

2603.44 --> 2621.839
see you i haven't seen you in a while

2605.28 --> 2621.8390000000004
i've been busy all right

2631.04 --> 2635.2
yeah man i'm still sweating here it's

2633.04 --> 2637.44
crazy i haven't even drunk any

2635.2 --> 2639.1189999999997
hot tea or anything and i'm still just

2637.44 --> 2643.2000000000003
right now sweating

2639.119 --> 2643.2000000000003
literally right now it's crazy hot

2647.04 --> 2652.16
all right anyway ah

2656.079 --> 2662.6400000000003
yeah also i've been kind of weirdly

2659.68 --> 2665.44
realizing realizing that i've been very

2662.64 --> 2668.319
distracted away from my book project

2665.44 --> 2669.839
again it happened it's like oh yeah i'm

2668.319 --> 2671.52
gonna really do it now

2669.839 --> 2673.2799999999997
and then i really do something now and

2671.52 --> 2675.68
suddenly like oh right

2673.28 --> 2677.0400000000004
oh you think you could actually sit down

2675.68 --> 2680.3999999999996
and disciplined

2677.04 --> 2682.079
finish that did you no no no you're

2680.4 --> 2685.119
gonna get a whole new boost of

2682.079 --> 2687.599
inspiration and energy out of nowhere

2685.119 --> 2689.28
to distract you away from continuing

2687.599 --> 2692.6400000000003
that

2689.28 --> 2696.1600000000003
yeah that's what happens to me this

2692.64 --> 2699.2
this is weird happened to me a lot

2696.16 --> 2701.2799999999997
in my life start something and it's like

2699.2 --> 2704.96
oh this is very promising

2701.28 --> 2707.92
and then i get super super distracted

2704.96 --> 2710.16
like so extremely distracted that

2707.92 --> 2710.7200000000003
sometimes like after half a year i bump

2710.16 --> 2713.839
into

2710.72 --> 2716.48
the project and like what the [ __ ]

2713.839 --> 2718.48
wait i was making something and then i

2716.48 --> 2721.04
completely forgot about it

2718.48 --> 2723.2
when was i what was i on my mind again

2721.04 --> 2726.319
and then it's kind of gone

2723.2 --> 2729.52
it's so freaky but i

2726.319 --> 2729.839
am definitely gonna continue scribbling

2729.52 --> 2732.88
up

2729.839 --> 2734.24
notes but they are not well it's this

2732.88 --> 2737.599
hot

2734.24 --> 2740.72
because that heat is not helping

2737.599 --> 2740.7200000000003
but it will continue

2741.68 --> 2745.44
and yeah just because i just want to

2744.8 --> 2748.88
finish

2745.44 --> 2751.76
i just want to finish a book

2748.88 --> 2754.6400000000003
i did finish my dnd book sort of but

2751.76 --> 2758.079
it's officially not really published

2754.64 --> 2760.7999999999997
but i really do want to finish the book

2758.079 --> 2762.1600000000003
and then yeah maybe everybody will make

2760.8 --> 2764.7200000000003
me the laughingstock out

2762.16 --> 2765.2799999999997
maybe i i'll get the worst review of a

2764.72 --> 2768.3999999999996
book of

2765.28 --> 2771.52
all time or bar maybe trump or something

2768.4 --> 2774.8
because everybody hates him politically

2771.52 --> 2776.72
but i don't care i don't care if nobody

2774.8 --> 2778.6400000000003
in the freaking world will respect it

2776.72 --> 2780.64
everybody will laugh at it if everybody

2778.64 --> 2784.0
thinks that i'm just a [ __ ] and an

2780.64 --> 2788.24
insane person and you know

2784.0 --> 2791.04
i don't care because i want to put down

2788.24 --> 2794.3999999999996
the understanding of the things how i

2791.04 --> 2797.839
figured it out over time

2794.4 --> 2800.2400000000002
and yeah maybe now nobody's gonna get it

2797.839 --> 2802.0789999999997
nobody will care everybody's gonna be

2800.24 --> 2805.2799999999997
preoccupied like why are you

2802.079 --> 2807.92
on to that when we obviously have to

2805.28 --> 2810.6400000000003
choose a side in the situation you know

2807.92 --> 2810.64
that [ __ ]

2811.04 --> 2815.52
so but yeah i if i write it down then

2813.2 --> 2816.0
maybe after 10 years whatever's left of

2815.52 --> 2819.52
the world

2816.0 --> 2822.4
then maybe then people will finally snap

2819.52 --> 2823.2
out of this [ __ ] polarization and be

2822.4 --> 2825.28
like

2823.2 --> 2827.1189999999997
wait wait what was are we talking about

2825.28 --> 2831.28
again

2827.119 --> 2834.079
you know hmm

2831.28 --> 2835.8390000000004
yeah maybe i'll be dead or something but

2834.079 --> 2836.2400000000002
at least then i'll have the freaking

2835.839 --> 2838.7999999999997
book

2836.24 --> 2840.4799999999996
or somebody somebody in the world might

2838.8 --> 2842.1600000000003
have my book

2840.48 --> 2844.48
and then suddenly they might realize

2842.16 --> 2848.0789999999997
like oh [ __ ]

2844.48 --> 2850.16
why couldn't we understand him

2848.079 --> 2852.559
well at least he has the book he left

2850.16 --> 2852.5589999999997
the book

2852.8 --> 2858.7200000000003
you know and then i can sort of yeah

2856.24 --> 2860.0
put a piece of my mind and my journey

2858.72 --> 2862.9599999999996
into that book

2860.0 --> 2866.0
as a reflection if i can't make people

2862.96 --> 2866.0
understand right now

2866.96 --> 2872.96
you'll buy a dank that's cool

2870.0 --> 2873.92
it might take a while though you know it

2872.96 --> 2877.52
might first be

2873.92 --> 2881.52
basically a pretty sloppy

2877.52 --> 2885.44
just work together piece of text

2881.52 --> 2887.839
but it should eventually definitely have

2885.44 --> 2888.319
pictures and my sketches and hopefully

2887.839 --> 2892.4
like

2888.319 --> 2894.5589999999997
really genuine 3d rendered pictures to

2892.4 --> 2898.4
represent it all

2894.559 --> 2900.8
and hey i've only been saying this for

2898.4 --> 2902.079
three years now i could use somebody's

2900.8 --> 2904.7200000000003
help with that

2902.079 --> 2906.96
and i know this is not adam's department

2904.72 --> 2908.64
because adam really knows how to find

2906.96 --> 2910.48
things on the internet and then make

2908.64 --> 2913.68
something really cool with it

2910.48 --> 2918.48
no i'm i'm a genuine

2913.68 --> 2921.5989999999997
3d modeler really knows how to work

2918.48 --> 2924.559
with yeah with this

2921.599 --> 2924.559
with what i'm doing

2925.44 --> 2930.88
now not no pictures though just words

2928.8 --> 2934.2400000000002
well that would be the first version

2930.88 --> 2936.96
that i would kind of rush out

2934.24 --> 2938.319
in order for it to be out there and then

2936.96 --> 2943.52
try to get a

2938.319 --> 2956.96
yeah a more a better version out

2943.52 --> 2960.559
hey jim

2956.96 --> 2962.559
hero is good yeah oh right uh yeah yeah

2960.559 --> 2964.48
i recommended channels right

2962.559 --> 2966.4
okay well a channel that i've kind of

2964.48 --> 2969.92
been following recently

2966.4 --> 2970.7200000000003
also from the also a part of the globe

2969.92 --> 2974.48
buster's team

2970.72 --> 2975.2799999999997
is rodrigo ferrari nunes i really like

2974.48 --> 2976.88
this guy

2975.28 --> 2978.96
he lives in the netherlands right now by

2976.88 --> 2982.839
the way that's kind of weird but

2978.96 --> 2985.04

2982.839 --> 2987.04
anthropologist studied official

2985.04 --> 2989.52
anthropologist

2989.52 --> 2993.7599999999998
senses

2990.48 --> 2997.28
he does he's not as wild i guess

2993.76 --> 2998.7200000000003
as i am but yeah he's a very sympathetic

2997.28 --> 3002.4
guy and i think

2998.72 --> 3003.9199999999996
he does get me in many ways and he at

3002.4 --> 3007.28
least understands what i'm trying to

3003.92 --> 3011.28
achieve with my cosmogeny things

3007.28 --> 3012.0
and he's an analyzer of the world as

3011.28 --> 3015.119
well in

3012.0 --> 3018.24
a very refined way i appreciate him so

3015.119 --> 3018.2400000000002

he has a really cool intro

3043.76 --> 3048.48
for his shows that are really kind of

3046.24 --> 3048.4799999999996
cool

3053.2 --> 3069.839
so the fuzzler

3056.559 --> 3069.8390000000004
i hope you got that

3073.44 --> 3078.96
ugh james true yeah yeah i had it

3079.119 --> 3097.839
no i didn't like it

3082.24 --> 3097.839
i don't like him

3099.599 --> 3104.079
nicholas riddle what did make me choose

3104.319 --> 3107.839
the essence the essence of it made me

3106.88 --> 3111.28
choose

3107.839 --> 3114.48
how pure is the original teaching

3111.28 --> 3115.0400000000004
i'm talking about the real the the

3114.48 --> 3118.16
things

3115.04 --> 3118.16
christ did

3119.2 --> 3121.7599999999998
and said

3122.24 --> 3127.5989999999997
i use it as an example it's not like i'm

3124.88 --> 3131.76
following the traditions

3127.599 --> 3133.92
of established christian religion

3131.76 --> 3136.3190000000004
that's not what i'm doing at all i'm

3133.92 --> 3140.64
very much an eclectic

3136.319 --> 3144.64
christian eclectic esoteric christian

3140.64 --> 3147.44
because i i look more at the essence

3144.64 --> 3148.24
of it the frequency the deeper the

3147.44 --> 3151.599
deeper

3148.24 --> 3154.4799999999996
overarching meaning and not

3151.599 --> 3156.1600000000003
the rules laid out by a freaking

3154.48 --> 3159.68
established religion which

3156.16 --> 3161.52
is contrary to christ's very own

3159.68 --> 3164.96
teachings

3161.52 --> 3166.16
and maybe it's that very paradox that

3164.96 --> 3169.599
drew me in

3166.16 --> 3171.92
the most because it's like like

3169.599 --> 3173.599
the devil will always try to corrupt

3171.92 --> 3176.079
that which is the purest

3173.599 --> 3176.079
the most

3178.079 --> 3184.6400000000003
so what i basically tried to do is

3181.119 --> 3186.4
just take the christianity out of the

3184.64 --> 3195.839
devil's hands

3186.4 --> 3195.839
for myself and trying to do it right

3198.0 --> 3203.92
but yeah i have sympathies

3201.68 --> 3203.9199999999996
and

3204.8 --> 3208.079
sympathies with other certain other

3206.96 --> 3210.88
bodies of religion

3208.079 --> 3212.0
as well and i've learned from them and

3210.88 --> 3216.079
they have

3212.0 --> 3220.0
interesting messages in them so i'm not

3216.079 --> 3220.6400000000003
i'm not polarizing myself to any

3220.0 --> 3224.48
religion

3220.64 --> 3228.8799999999997
i'm only polarizing to the frequency and

3224.48 --> 3232.0
what people actually do and the level of

3228.88 --> 3233.04
struggle that they go through as they're

3232.0 --> 3235.839
doing it

3233.04 --> 3238.079
like how real are they about it because

3235.839 --> 3241.52
that thing

3238.079 --> 3241.52
transcends all religion

3242.24 --> 3246.24
how real are they in what they believe

3245.2 --> 3249.2
in

3246.24 --> 3250.24
or are they just like most people going

3249.2 --> 3253.52
along to get along

3250.24 --> 3254.0789999999997
or even grabblers trying to hollow it

3253.52 --> 3257.44
out for

3254.079 --> 3261.92
using it as a as a place of crime

3257.44 --> 3261.92
it's a cover so many of that

3262.64 --> 3267.359
and all religions all religions all

3265.839 --> 3269.2799999999997
religions are have

3267.359 --> 3272.0
gravel elements in them there's not a

3269.28 --> 3275.76
single official religion that doesn't

3272.0 --> 3277.4
not a single one it's almost like that

3275.76 --> 3279.92
the default

3277.4 --> 3280.4
requirement in order to be established

3279.92 --> 3282.559
as

3280.4 --> 3284.48
an official religion is that grapplers

3282.559 --> 3287.6800000000003
will

3284.48 --> 3293.839
demand to take hold of it and then only

3287.68 --> 3293.839
will they allow it to be official

3302.559 --> 3307.8390000000004
okay nicholas riddle

3318.24 --> 3323.52
spiritual then religious did what does

3321.04 --> 3323.52
that mean

3325.599 --> 3329.839
you know spiritual is just as much

3328.4 --> 3333.04
grabbled

3329.839 --> 3335.52
in terminology out there like the

3333.04 --> 3337.2799999999997
supposed non-religious spiritual people

3335.52 --> 3340.4
well guess what among those are

3337.28 --> 3343.6800000000003
really [ __ ] up satanists

3340.4 --> 3346.7200000000003
as well people that are just [ __ ]

3343.68 --> 3350.5589999999997
insane overtly insane

3346.72 --> 3353.359
not even directly nefarious maybe

3350.559 --> 3355.52
but just overtly insane and they're also

3353.359 --> 3358.24
categorized as spiritual

3355.52 --> 3360.4
so that doesn't really mean anything to

3358.24 --> 3360.3999999999996
me

3361.68 --> 3368.8799999999997
evacuated yeah right it's all about

3364.88 --> 3371.839
sensibility or evacuation thereof

3368.88 --> 3373.119
like how much essence of what you really

3371.839 --> 3375.92
need to follow

3373.119 --> 3376.319
the real god's law that are unwritten

3375.92 --> 3378.7200000000003
it's

3376.319 --> 3380.319
the essence of creation itself that

3378.72 --> 3383.2
reveals it

3380.319 --> 3385.2
how much of that essence the original

3383.2 --> 3389.2799999999997
source essence of creation

3385.2 --> 3392.72
the real god will you be able to retain

3389.28 --> 3394.0
while living because you're born with

3392.72 --> 3397.9199999999996
all of it

3394.0 --> 3397.92
how much will you be able to retain

3399.599 --> 3403.04
how much will you lose how much will you

3401.52 --> 3406.24
give up how much will you

3403.04 --> 3419.839
allow yourself to be mutilated

3406.24 --> 3419.839
by your own foolishness

3438.4 --> 3442.88
okay nicholas riddle i can go with that

3440.96 --> 3444.88
i kind of agree

3442.88 --> 3446.2400000000002
a religion is technically just a

3444.88 --> 3449.839
tradition

3446.24 --> 3452.5589999999997
so religious tradition specific

3449.839 --> 3453.599
pattern of rules code of conduct and all

3452.559 --> 3456.6400000000003
that

3453.599 --> 3461.079
but yeah that code of contact that

3456.64 --> 3464.0
those rules can be messed with can be

3461.079 --> 3466.96
re-interpreted for you

3464.0 --> 3468.64
by priests that's a risk with any

3466.96 --> 3471.359
organized religion

3468.64 --> 3472.8799999999997
it's always that's how it gets graveled

3471.359 --> 3477.04
if it wasn't grappled from the

3472.88 --> 3477.04
from the get-go so

3479.52 --> 3487.44
i think that jesus christ

3482.64 --> 3491.359
the message that everyone is their own

3487.44 --> 3494.48
you have to be your priest to god

3491.359 --> 3497.92
and your body is your church

3494.48 --> 3503.839
keep it clean keep it pure

3497.92 --> 3503.839
don't let the darkness in

3527.28 --> 3531.8390000000004
uh steve no no they definitely don't

3532.24 --> 3535.5989999999997
they definitely do not

3535.76 --> 3540.079
but all paths of all people lead to

3538.4 --> 3545.839
death

3540.079 --> 3545.8390000000004
that's not because of religion

3560.72 --> 3563.04
all right

3564.0 --> 3571.119
yeah sorry steve but they really don't

3567.44 --> 3574.4
religious paths don't lead

3571.119 --> 3575.2000000000003
to the same goal they all have different

3574.4 --> 3578.4
objectives

3575.2 --> 3580.799
but usually they end up making people

3578.4 --> 3581.599
politicized in certain ways closing off

3580.799 --> 3584.72
and then

3581.599 --> 3586.319
trying to achieve a temporary goal in

3584.72 --> 3588.799
the world

3586.319 --> 3588.799
somehow

3591.839 --> 3599.119
yeah and whether how that will reflect

3595.839 --> 3603.2
of their afterlife

3599.119 --> 3603.2000000000003
that's a wholly a whole different matter

3603.92 --> 3608.799
what shirt off and hair down no i'm not

3606.4 --> 3611.28
going to put my hair down

3608.799 --> 3612.72
i'll get cooked right away because all

3611.28 --> 3615.8390000000004
that hair is all going to be

3612.72 --> 3616.24
retaining air in the layer around my

3615.839 --> 3619.68
hair

3616.24 --> 3622.319
around my head it's going to cook me
