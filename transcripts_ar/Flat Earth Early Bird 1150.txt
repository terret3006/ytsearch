right

so

137.34 --> 144.0
it is Tuesday the 8th of February 2022.

146.36 --> 153.14000000000001
nobody's in just yet ah YouTube first in

150.66 --> 153.14

154.44 --> 157.34
how are you doing

168.36 --> 173.239
first troll here oh goody do I need to

170.76 --> 173.239
ban you

178.2 --> 181.39999999999998
hey Crockett

189.599 --> 194.459
oh man

191.64 --> 196.2
I'm actually really hungry right now but

194.459 --> 198.18
I yeah

196.2 --> 201.17999999999998
didn't have any time to prepare anything

198.18 --> 204.84
didn't have like a croissant waiting to

201.18 --> 204.84
be heated up unfortunately

208.44 --> 211.76
uh Hey Matthew Hall

211.86 --> 217.62
okay well yeah I'm doing okay doing

214.62 --> 220.37900000000002
pretty good actually but I am hungry but

217.62 --> 223.70000000000002
hey being hungry is look it's

220.379 --> 223.7
generally good

234.239 --> 237.31900000000002
okay YouTube

244.14 --> 248.819
right but yeah the weather's been

246.659 --> 252.019
changing around

248.819 --> 252.01899999999998
a lot so

252.54 --> 257.759
and today it's just kind of not rainy

254.819 --> 259.94
but cloudy fine I have no problem with

257.759 --> 259.94
that

265.08 --> 270.44
what cutting down what I eat sick of

267.9 --> 270.44
being fort

271.74 --> 276.66
St

273.72 --> 279.02000000000004
ones is that like a weight indicator

276.66 --> 279.02000000000004
okay

280.68 --> 283.04
right

290.639 --> 294.02
are you on iodine

294.3 --> 298.68
right because usually when you

297.0 --> 302.22
in my

298.68 --> 306.3
personal rough experience it's really

302.22 --> 310.199
hard to compare to everybody else's but

306.3 --> 313.5
usually when people get bloaty they have

310.199 --> 316.22
too much intake of one type and not

313.5 --> 316.22
enough of another

317.46 --> 323.46
right so usually because

320.58 --> 326.34
I've been had times where I was kind a

323.46 --> 328.85999999999996
little bit chubby not like fat really

326.34 --> 332.21999999999997
overweight or anything but when I would

328.86 --> 333.539
just get a bit more bloaty but if I

332.22 --> 335.40000000000003
didn't just

333.539 --> 338.4
had the right

335.4 --> 341.46
substances

338.4 --> 344.46
like with me for a starter that would

341.46 --> 346.32
have been fish oil really weird when I

344.46 --> 350.039
started to take fish oil suddenly my

346.32 --> 353.09999999999997
craving for other type oily stuff

350.039 --> 356.15999999999997
like uh

353.1 --> 358.319
like cheap ass french fries and all that

356.16 --> 360.41900000000004
because back in the day I would still go

358.319 --> 362.52000000000004
out and just go to a snack bar and eat

360.419 --> 363.65999999999997
french fries right now I never do that

362.52 --> 365.58
anymore

363.66 --> 367.97900000000004
not because I don't eat french fries I

365.58 --> 372.0
actually eat french fries almost every

367.979 --> 373.8
day but I make myself all organic and I

372.0 --> 376.38
just don't

373.8 --> 378.90000000000003
I don't need as much because I also take

376.38 --> 381.479
fish oil so right

378.9 --> 382.25899999999996
that will be a good way of approaching

381.479 --> 384.539
it

382.259 --> 385.68
just figure out like what altogether are

384.539 --> 389.58
you eating

385.68 --> 392.58
including snacks and then why

389.58 --> 394.38
why why the cravings

392.58 --> 396.3
is there something you're missing and

394.38 --> 399.36
then you're kind of replacing it with

396.3 --> 400.8
stuff that's a poor imitation of what

399.36 --> 402.84000000000003
you actually need

400.8 --> 405.24
right

402.84 --> 410.4
I've used that formula

405.24 --> 411.84000000000003
for 20 years and uh hey it's I'm not

410.4 --> 414.17999999999995
exactly

411.84 --> 417.9
fat or anything so

414.18 --> 420.86
right all right yeah I can't really see

417.9 --> 420.85999999999996
that much hold on

428.639 --> 435.539
yeah this is not a great example

432.36 --> 439.56
but I'm not gonna show you my belly

435.539 --> 442.38
but overall for somebody 42

439.56 --> 445.56
it's not bad

442.38 --> 448.38
wait I'm out of the camera right so yeah

445.56 --> 452.52
I have a little bit of a Bella

448.38 --> 457.139
I used to be like super flat like like

452.52 --> 457.139
creepy model level flat

457.68 --> 463.68
like 10 years ago only outdone by my ex

461.099 --> 467.759
who had like

463.68 --> 469.979
super waste amazing right

467.759 --> 472.379
so yeah over time

469.979 --> 474.78
the way you look you can't really change

472.379 --> 477.90000000000003
too much about that

474.78 --> 481.02
but if you pay attention more to the

477.9 --> 483.06
food and why crave certain things and

481.02 --> 486.0
then try to figure out what's going on

483.06 --> 488.819
and what's going wrong

486.0 --> 490.74
through to craving that would be my

488.819 --> 493.46000000000004
personal advice it's worked out very

490.74 --> 493.46000000000004
well for myself

494.039 --> 497.28
it does

495.419 --> 499.62
always remain a bit of a challenge

497.28 --> 502.08
though

499.62 --> 506.16
but like even my dad follows this

502.08 --> 511.31899999999996
principle and he is like in his 70s now

506.16 --> 514.08
and he's not much worse than than me

511.319 --> 516.419
he's a little bit more plumpy but yeah

514.08 --> 518.899
come on 70 you know it's freaking

516.419 --> 518.899
amazing

520.919 --> 528.0
and it's all about just always trying to

523.919 --> 530.64
figure out realizing if you your body

528.0 --> 532.92
will be craving for things it needs

530.64 --> 535.56
but then you the Consciousness then

532.92 --> 538.3199999999999
makes choices as to how to interpret

535.56 --> 541.3199999999999
that and if you get that interpretation

538.32 --> 544.1400000000001
system really in order

541.32 --> 546.12
you'll find that your body is the most

544.14 --> 548.76
helpful thing to figure out what you

546.12 --> 551.0
actually need to eat

548.76 --> 551.0
foreign

556.44 --> 559.1
right

561.899 --> 567.14
yeah yeah but look radical diets and all

564.959 --> 567.14
that

567.18 --> 573.2399999999999
or yeah the such things YouTube I mean

570.779 --> 575.64
that can work but the problem is Swing

573.24 --> 576.899
of the pendulum so you're starving

575.64 --> 579.36
yourself

576.899 --> 581.399
after the starvation though is over your

579.36 --> 584.399
body's gonna be okay now fill up again

581.399 --> 587.64
it always happens right so the only real

584.399 --> 590.519
way to do it is to go directly

587.64 --> 592.86
after the cravings and figure out what

590.519 --> 595.44
it is your body's needing and then

592.86 --> 598.32
what's what would be the best form of

595.44 --> 601.0790000000001
that thing it's really craving for

598.32 --> 603.6
because if you then provide that

601.079 --> 607.4399999999999
the healthy stuff

603.6 --> 609.0
you're not gonna be grabbing snacks all

607.44 --> 611.399
the time for example I don't know if

609.0 --> 614.839
you're doing that but

611.399 --> 614.839
right I hope you're getting it

627.3 --> 633.54
salt helps helps much with cravings

630.959 --> 638.399
well yeah I eat plenty of salt look guys

633.54 --> 642.079
I eat plenty of salt and a lot of fat

638.399 --> 642.079
I really do this

644.64 --> 650.22
salt is good well take the good so don't

647.22 --> 652.32
take like refined table salt right I

650.22 --> 654.6
haven't touched that stuff in ages

652.32 --> 657.24
because that's just poison

654.6 --> 659.76
I don't even like the taste anymore no I

657.24 --> 664.04
just take good salt which could be like

659.76 --> 667.3199999999999
C like almost refined uh

664.04 --> 671.0
non-refined sea salt from special places

667.32 --> 671.0
or Himalayan sea salt

672.06 --> 677.779
it's like salt from the coast of

675.12 --> 677.779
France

679.44 --> 684.1800000000001
it's also pretty good right but pink

681.899 --> 687.779
Himalayan salt yeah that's been the best

684.18 --> 689.399
form of salt so far and I'm never I

687.779 --> 692.76
I cook

689.399 --> 694.62
what is it like a like an Italian chef I

692.76 --> 696.8389999999999
don't know if that's even a legitimate

694.62 --> 698.76
thing anymore but that's how I was

696.839 --> 701.7
brought up is like yeah Italian chef you

698.76 --> 704.7
just overdo the herbs overdo the salt

701.7 --> 708.24
and the pepper like a massive tastes

704.7 --> 711.12
right that's kind of how I cook

708.24 --> 715.5790000000001
and it's working great for me

711.12 --> 715.579
garwinian salt okay that's weird

722.82 --> 725.1800000000001
right

726.779 --> 732.66
making the packets a certain size yep

729.6 --> 735.36
yes YouTube that's so funny that you

732.66 --> 737.3389999999999
mentioned because I agree

735.36 --> 740.82
and

737.339 --> 743.5790000000001
it's also a matter of your eyes though

740.82 --> 746.88
right because a lot of like typical

743.579 --> 750.66
Meats like sausages or a hamburger

746.88 --> 752.9399999999999
where I go they always come in Paris

750.66 --> 755.519
and you can say oh that's fine right and

752.94 --> 757.86
one one day the next day the other one

755.519 --> 760.5
well

757.86 --> 761.399
it turns out that the way I'm eating a

760.5 --> 763.38
lot

761.399 --> 765.72
the next day I don't really want to eat

763.38 --> 768.18
the same thing

765.72 --> 771.48
usually I skip a day then but sometimes

768.18 --> 774.779
like it's been like one has been enough

771.48 --> 777.6
and then my body's like nope

774.779 --> 779.3389999999999
you don't want that other thing it's

777.6 --> 781.62
really confusing and then I'm like oh my

779.339 --> 783.24
God but I don't want to waste it it's a

781.62 --> 785.579
bit problematic

783.24 --> 788.639
there's not not a lot you can do except

785.579 --> 790.9799999999999
for like tactically

788.639 --> 792.899
freeze storing

790.98 --> 796.2
the things that you're not gonna eat

792.899 --> 798.36
directly but yeah that it's annoying and

796.2 --> 802.0400000000001
it never comes out the same quality of

798.36 --> 802.04
course right so yeah

802.38 --> 808.019
right

804.24 --> 810.3
anyway hope a little bit of diet advice

808.019 --> 812.4590000000001
in the morning

810.3 --> 814.5
I hope that helped

812.459 --> 817.1999999999999
help to give some perspective right

814.5 --> 819.12
because when you're like usually people

817.2 --> 821.22
that are like oh I'm overweight I'm

819.12 --> 823.44
afraid and they're always thinking about

821.22 --> 825.6600000000001
oh I've got to starve myself but that's

823.44 --> 827.6990000000001
not the thing you should be doing in my

825.66 --> 829.56
opinion you should be looking at the

827.699 --> 832.68
Cravings themselves at the things you

829.56 --> 835.4399999999999
really love because those are

832.68 --> 837.12
the problem or rather

835.44 --> 838.94
the Cravings themselves are not the

837.12 --> 840.9590000000001
problem you shouldn't like take

838.94 --> 842.1600000000001
Pharmaceuticals to suppress that or

840.959 --> 847.4399999999999
something

842.16 --> 849.0
drastic no the way you deal with them

847.44 --> 852.12
is

849.0 --> 853.86
in a misunderstood way

852.12 --> 855.899
and there's something you can really

853.86 --> 858.12
learn there there's something you can

855.899 --> 860.1
build there and perfect

858.12 --> 862.86
with a plan

860.1 --> 866.1
to really get control over your hunger

862.86 --> 869.339
cravings like it's a like it's a pet

866.1 --> 872.0400000000001
right like a cat that just never refuse

869.339 --> 875.6990000000001
that refuses to stop eating

872.04 --> 878.519
well dealing with a cat

875.699 --> 880.5
is a lot easier compared to dealing with

878.519 --> 882.36
it yourself but if you can kind of like

880.5 --> 884.76
spiritually compartmentalize the

882.36 --> 886.1990000000001
mechanism inside yourself

884.76 --> 889.4399999999999
then

886.199 --> 892.019
you could like well let's make this cat

889.44 --> 895.0790000000001
healthy again right

892.019 --> 897.42
he's always hungry well why

895.079 --> 901.3199999999999
what can you give him that would

897.42 --> 906.019
actually satisfy it and and die down the

901.32 --> 906.019
hunger so etc etc right anyway

912.48 --> 917.22
all right keep Reinventing diet yeah but

914.82 --> 921.899
YouTube there's another thing about that

917.22 --> 924.1800000000001
there's a busy there busy therapy Factor

921.899 --> 926.279
to constantly oh look there's a new diet

924.18 --> 930.2399999999999
oh we're gonna try the new diet right

926.279 --> 934.68
because it sounds weird dieting

930.24 --> 936.6
is also a bit of a social ritual

934.68 --> 939.959
right it gives you something to talk

936.6 --> 941.88
about or or like oh a fellow Dieter you

939.959 --> 944.579
have this little bond that you can do

941.88 --> 947.279
something with so yeah that's a part

944.579 --> 950.699
it's not because oh it's so effective no

947.279 --> 954.3
it's because a lot of people have weight

950.699 --> 957.8389999999999
issues in certain regions of the world

954.3 --> 960.959
and they have loneliness and isolation

957.839 --> 964.44
issues which is a universal growing

960.959 --> 966.66
problem also because of the internet now

964.44 --> 970.62
and well

966.66 --> 972.7199999999999
lockdowns makes it even worse Etc right

970.62 --> 974.399
and there's like dieting gives you

972.72 --> 975.839
something to talk about for a lot of

974.399 --> 978.3
these people so it doesn't even

975.839 --> 981.74
necessarily have to work but it keeps

978.3 --> 981.74
them going you see

984.6 --> 990.32
Indians have the fasting day yes so do

987.12 --> 990.32
Mormons by the way YouTube

991.44 --> 997.2790000000001
I think they do it like

993.899 --> 997.279
every month or so

1004.16 --> 1009.079
right so yeah there's many things to

1006.44 --> 1010.339
consider comes to the world of dieting

1009.079 --> 1013.4799999999999
what is it

1010.339 --> 1013.48
what works best

1014.3 --> 1020.12
but they are American this is

1017.48 --> 1022.899
yeah they are

1020.12 --> 1022.899
most of them

1024.679 --> 1030.439
although they do go around in the world

1027.559 --> 1033.86
there's Mormons here too

1030.439 --> 1035.959
and then Elders from America come over

1033.86 --> 1037.1
and it's always a blast it's always like

1035.959 --> 1039.14
oh

1037.1 --> 1040.339
what brain news do you bring from

1039.14 --> 1042.0200000000002
America

1040.339 --> 1045.4389999999999
like how's the

1042.02 --> 1047.539
you get a little inside look

1045.439 --> 1049.8200000000002
from the elders it's always awesome and

1047.539 --> 1052.84
you can give them their blessings

1049.82 --> 1052.84
when they go back

1055.28 --> 1061.52
I really like Mormons like in general

1058.039 --> 1063.86
not that I'm like a super into them or

1061.52 --> 1065.84
anything it's just that pretty much

1063.86 --> 1068.1789999999999
every experience I've had with them has

1065.84 --> 1070.72
always been

1068.179 --> 1070.72
nice

1072.38 --> 1077.419
and interesting

1075.2 --> 1079.64
like always surprisingly interesting

1077.419 --> 1082.5200000000002
it's not interesting in a way that

1079.64 --> 1084.7
that's really straightforward what you'd

1082.52 --> 1084.7
expect

1084.799 --> 1092.179
all right anyway

1086.299 --> 1094.58
American splits fasting yeah yeah that's

1092.179 --> 1098.419
no Americans only fast when they really

1094.58 --> 1101.26
need to like when everything breaks down

1098.419 --> 1101.26
in general

1108.44 --> 1110.919
gig

1118.58 --> 1124.039
well at least all this

1120.559 --> 1128.12
diet talk has helped me make my Hunger

1124.039 --> 1130.4
die down somewhat that's a relief

1128.12 --> 1133.539
because yeah being hungry for too long

1130.4 --> 1133.539
is very distracting

1146.6 --> 1152.84
right by the way also a general tip for

1150.02 --> 1158.299
anybody trying to watch their weight try

1152.84 --> 1161.78
to avoid MSG monosodium glutamate

1158.299 --> 1164.12
it's usually noted it's still around in

1161.78 --> 1167.0
organic food too it's noted as a yeast

1164.12 --> 1169.6399999999999
extract and it can even be claimed to be

1167.0 --> 1172.22
coming from an organic Source but it

1169.64 --> 1176.179
what it does is it actually amplifies

1172.22 --> 1179.1200000000001
your hunger and like beyond the meal

1176.179 --> 1182.3600000000001
and it's not a very healthy thing so

1179.12 --> 1184.1
that would be a universally good tip for

1182.36 --> 1187.76
anybody's trying to watch their weight

1184.1 --> 1189.3799999999999
always stay clear of MSG or yeast

1187.76 --> 1193.94
extract as it's

1189.38 --> 1193.94
with euphemistically rebranded

1202.1 --> 1210.08
oh God died yeah well aspartame and all

1206.059 --> 1212.6
the family adjacent ones yeah but those

1210.08 --> 1214.6999999999998
are just

1212.6 --> 1219.039
just bad news

1214.7 --> 1219.039
like it'll mess up your organs and [ __ ]

1226.159 --> 1231.6200000000001
right but if you want to be actually

1229.039 --> 1235.52
successful with losing weight on the

1231.62 --> 1240.3799999999999
long run you gotta drop all

1235.52 --> 1242.48
like sugary drinks all fizzy sugary

1240.38 --> 1246.0390000000002
drinks really

1242.48 --> 1246.039
as in Cola

1246.26 --> 1250.94
all that sort of what do you call again

1248.539 --> 1253.9
uh

1250.94 --> 1253.9
what's the name for that

1262.52 --> 1268.039
well I already described the sugary

1265.039 --> 1271.1589999999999
based drinks like cold drinks with just

1268.039 --> 1273.799
taste and sugar and energy drinks like

1271.159 --> 1275.9
you gotta drop that one specifically

1273.799 --> 1279.08
alcohol

1275.9 --> 1280.8200000000002
well look alcohol is a complicated thing

1279.08 --> 1283.3999999999999
because

1280.82 --> 1286.3999999999999
I still drink beer

1283.4 --> 1288.679
but I always limit it and I give it a

1286.4 --> 1291.2
specific time in the day it's like a

1288.679 --> 1293.72
daily ritual in a way that I made into

1291.2 --> 1296.6200000000001
it to keep it under control not make me

1293.72 --> 1296.6200000000001
lose my mind

1297.98 --> 1302.179
right because if you keep drinking if

1300.26 --> 1306.08
you have that problem then it's alcohol

1302.179 --> 1309.679
is very bad not just for weight issues

1306.08 --> 1311.86
also for yeah for your heart

1309.679 --> 1311.8600000000001
Etc

1315.74 --> 1319.94
and it's not even like having it in you

1317.96 --> 1321.02
it's when it goes away that's the

1319.94 --> 1322.94
problem

1321.02 --> 1325.58
that's when the real Health burden

1322.94 --> 1328.3600000000001
starts anyway

1325.58 --> 1328.36
uh

1329.659 --> 1336.2
but yeah I I haven't like drinking

1332.72 --> 1338.0
Cola any sort

1336.2 --> 1340.46
I don't have the habit of doing that

1338.0 --> 1343.22
anymore I used to of course I love like

1340.46 --> 1344.78
Coca-Cola I love that [ __ ]

1343.22 --> 1348.08
but

1344.78 --> 1350.6589999999999
didn't drink it too much even

1348.08 --> 1352.76
but it's just not good for you

1350.659 --> 1356.679
and if you especially the older you get

1352.76 --> 1356.679
the the more of a burden it becomes

1358.58 --> 1363.26
so you just yeah it's

1360.86 --> 1366.8799999999999
it's an unfortunate thing that those

1363.26 --> 1366.8799999999999
types of drinks even exist

1376.82 --> 1380.539
but yeah yeah taking it away is just

1379.82 --> 1384.4399999999998
gonna

1380.539 --> 1386.24
create another drug like craze anyway

1384.44 --> 1389.659
you gotta find the discipline for

1386.24 --> 1393.28
yourself and just realize what it is

1389.659 --> 1393.2800000000002
and then stay away from it

1394.4 --> 1399.44
because even like in the organic

1396.5 --> 1402.2
Supermarket there is like a

1399.44 --> 1404.659
fizzy sugary type drink section and they

1402.2 --> 1407.24
and then they don't use the regular

1404.659 --> 1410.44
sugar they use not corn syrup thank God

1407.24 --> 1410.44
they use some other

1410.96 --> 1415.159
naturally

1412.7 --> 1417.88
derived sugar of some type but it's

1415.159 --> 1417.88
still not good

1418.28 --> 1422.72
like it's not a good replacement oh keep

1421.159 --> 1426.159
drinking that that's not a problem yeah

1422.72 --> 1426.159
it is it still is a problem

1427.039 --> 1430.8799999999999
but yeah so you're gonna find that

1429.62 --> 1433.76
everywhere you're always going to be

1430.88 --> 1436.22
bumping into it so just

1433.76 --> 1438.98
make sure that you're

1436.22 --> 1440.779
mentally disconnected from it like this

1438.98 --> 1443.02
is not yours anymore you don't do that

1440.779 --> 1443.02
anymore

1443.299 --> 1445.779
anyway

1461.6 --> 1467.8999999999999
yeah

1463.88 --> 1470.5590000000002
yeah sugar and kids is a big difficult

1467.9 --> 1470.5590000000002
obstacle

1471.26 --> 1476.48
because they're they're gonna be lured

1473.539 --> 1480.039
in to get that sugary stuff all the time

1476.48 --> 1480.039
wherever you take them

1480.32 --> 1484.6399999999999
it's a real challenge

1482.179 --> 1486.44
like how do you keep your kids off sugar

1484.64 --> 1489.5
addiction

1486.44 --> 1492.02
like especially like never like oh just

1489.5 --> 1494.179
oh I like this I'm gonna give him a

1492.02 --> 1496.6
piece of candy yeah that's where it

1494.179 --> 1496.6000000000001
starts

1496.94 --> 1502.5800000000002
how do you avoid that that's really I've

1499.46 --> 1504.919
seen other like even when I was a kid

1502.58 --> 1507.86
I would pay attention to how other kids

1504.919 --> 1509.3600000000001
like in my class would be raised I

1507.86 --> 1510.8799999999999
didn't even talk with the parents about

1509.36 --> 1514.6999999999998
it sometime

1510.88 --> 1517.7
as a kid right pretty weird talking

1514.7 --> 1520.279
about raising a kid as I'm being that

1517.7 --> 1522.919
kid right but

1520.279 --> 1525.86
yeah some parents would manage to like

1522.919 --> 1528.919
have a full food plan

1525.86 --> 1530.299
and they would always give something

1528.919 --> 1532.5200000000002
else

1530.299 --> 1534.62
some people were like really all about

1532.52 --> 1536.179
the raisins

1534.62 --> 1539.6
right

1536.179 --> 1540.98
like take that instead

1539.6 --> 1543.799
and

1540.98 --> 1546.4
yeah I think that that's a pretty good

1543.799 --> 1546.4
strategy

1547.279 --> 1551.84
because if you really raise them little

1549.74 --> 1554.659
treats that are kind of natural like

1551.84 --> 1557.4189999999999
raisins then eventually if they were to

1554.659 --> 1559.22
ever like oh here take this candy and

1557.419 --> 1562.22
they tried they'd be like Ugh what's

1559.22 --> 1563.96
this it's like poison yuck

1562.22 --> 1566.0
right

1563.96 --> 1567.02
because they're used to Natural good

1566.0 --> 1569.6
stuff

1567.02 --> 1572.12
and then that'll really

1569.6 --> 1574.24
yeah solve that problem a lot of the

1572.12 --> 1574.2399999999998
time

1577.039 --> 1579.58
anyway

1584.179 --> 1587.179
please

1594.26 --> 1600.82
okay interesting Ralph Rodriguez

1597.38 --> 1600.8200000000002
fruits and vegetables

1601.88 --> 1604.3600000000001
right

1621.98 --> 1627.799
right

1624.559 --> 1629.9189999999999
it's diatok uh there's a time and a

1627.799 --> 1629.9189999999999
place

1630.98 --> 1636.32
why not

1633.679 --> 1637.94
all right it's very important to a whole

1636.32 --> 1640.34
bunch of people in all kinds of age

1637.94 --> 1644.24
categories so

1640.34 --> 1646.039
yeah it's good to to gather and pass

1644.24 --> 1648.46
around the knowledge that you've

1646.039 --> 1648.46
attained

1648.86 --> 1654.52
and I'm really appreciating all of your

1651.02 --> 1654.52
input and chat about it too

1654.679 --> 1658.6000000000001
sugar tax oh my God

1689.179 --> 1694.3400000000001
right well yeah George Sanford this is

1692.059 --> 1696.98
very basic

1694.34 --> 1699.799
but yeah if you're gonna eat meat and

1696.98 --> 1703.24
taters of some kind then make sure you

1699.799 --> 1703.24
eat enough vegetables

1703.279 --> 1707.48
because if you're just gonna eat meat

1705.44 --> 1711.64
and tater yeah that's gonna really

1707.48 --> 1711.64
fatten you up eventually

1713.659 --> 1717.679
all right so when I take any type of

1715.34 --> 1720.5
meal like that which is by the way very

1717.679 --> 1724.539
typically Dutch always some kind of a

1720.5 --> 1724.539
vegetable alongside it

1726.2 --> 1729.88
I usually like red beets

1730.159 --> 1733.1200000000001
all right what's that

1747.98 --> 1750.58
hmm

1757.34 --> 1762.4399999999998
okay that's

1759.44 --> 1762.44
biochemistry

1764.26 --> 1772.779
tea coffee wine cereal grains vegetables

1769.58 --> 1772.779
fruits and berries

1778.64 --> 1781.2990000000002
hmm

1801.26 --> 1805.82
just don't deep fry them

1804.26 --> 1809.679
boo

1805.82 --> 1809.6789999999999
oh damn well deep fry them

1810.5 --> 1815.26
I mean I I also like them non-deep fried

1815.48 --> 1820.82
but

1816.98 --> 1822.08
no I like my French fries

1820.82 --> 1825.08
I just

1822.08 --> 1828.3799999999999
tried to limit the amount and

1825.08 --> 1831.52
keep the oil well

1828.38 --> 1831.5200000000002
keep it good

1837.279 --> 1842.44
boiling mushroom sticky minutes too all

1840.38 --> 1842.44
right

1854.72 --> 1860.38
thank you for that Lord of the Rings

1857.059 --> 1860.3799999999999
reference Dino Crisis

1861.62 --> 1863.9189999999999
foreign

1916.22 --> 1919.22
foreign

1930.7 --> 1936.44
let's try to get back into Flat Earth or

1934.159 --> 1939.88
something like that

1936.44 --> 1939.88
enough diet talk

1942.74 --> 1945.64
what happened

1946.82 --> 1951.2
yeah Flat Earth debate yesterday I

1948.98 --> 1953.96
missed most of it I was actually gonna

1951.2 --> 1955.94
going out for some special groceries

1953.96 --> 1958.64
which take more time

1955.94 --> 1961.7
I really had to get that

1958.64 --> 1964.24
and then when I got back like I I like

1961.7 --> 1964.24
the

1964.34 --> 1971.059
the after show was already over

1967.22 --> 1972.98
fortunately so yeah but I was told it

1971.059 --> 1975.7
there was no baller coming on or

1972.98 --> 1975.7
anything so

1977.0 --> 1981.7
kind of a calm Monday

1978.98 --> 1981.7
fed

1987.14 --> 1991.7
anyone else been moving Moody lately

1989.659 --> 1993.6200000000001
turning up the radio weight well there's

1991.7 --> 1998.14
something

1993.62 --> 1998.1399999999999
turning up the radio waves or maybe

1998.419 --> 2004.2990000000002
yeah could be I was actually thinking

2001.72 --> 2008.3990000000001
that yesterday night

2004.299 --> 2008.399
seemed like there was a lot of activity

2014.5 --> 2020.1
but uh yeah

2017.5 --> 2020.1
I don't know

2024.46 --> 2028.48
look at some point if you're gonna be

2026.26 --> 2031.419
thinking that that that's actually

2028.48 --> 2034.24
happening because of radioactivity well

2031.419 --> 2035.98
then you actually should test it you

2034.24 --> 2038.2
should actually make samples you should

2035.98 --> 2042.039
have a radio wave

2038.2 --> 2044.38
tester right there's those devices

2042.039 --> 2048.7
that will just test in the Moment Like

2044.38 --> 2051.159
is this higher activity than the usual

2048.7 --> 2053.4399999999996
what's going on is it really that

2051.159 --> 2055.7400000000002
or is what you're experiencing something

2053.44 --> 2055.7400000000002
else

2066.82 --> 2070.96
right but yeah those devices are pretty

2069.22 --> 2074.7999999999997
expensive

2070.96 --> 2077.579
so yeah if you're going to be doing that

2074.8 --> 2077.579
I realize

2085.06 --> 2088.679
you'll be careful with that thing

2089.079 --> 2094.48
anti-flat earthers are losing yeah no

2091.419 --> 2096.7
[ __ ] this is they've been losing for

2094.48 --> 2098.14
quite a long time now

2096.7 --> 2101.02
but they're all becoming a bit

2098.14 --> 2104.4
hysterical so it seems like Sean Hawkins

2101.02 --> 2104.4
is just going nuts again

2104.68 --> 2112.14
seem like he's literally stalking my

2107.859 --> 2112.14
comments in other people's chats

2112.839 --> 2119.32
saying ER coward Polaris challenge the

2115.54 --> 2121.56
usual so he's just in full-on squirt and

2119.32 --> 2121.56
repeat

2124.06 --> 2127.96
but yeah all the other anti-flaters they

2126.339 --> 2130.839
don't really know what to do anymore

2127.96 --> 2133.7200000000003
right we're coming at a point with the

2130.839 --> 2137.2599999999998
Flat Earth debates where I started out

2133.72 --> 2138.8799999999997
jokingly remember saying yeah we know

2137.26 --> 2142.119
like

2138.88 --> 2142.96
if the Earth wasn't flat then the globe

2142.119 --> 2145.839
model

2142.96 --> 2149.7400000000002
couldn't have been designed

2145.839 --> 2152.2599999999998
the way it works right that is kind of

2149.74 --> 2154.7799999999997
like a joke or it started out like that

2152.26 --> 2157.1800000000003
but it's actually true and the

2154.78 --> 2158.619
implications are

2157.18 --> 2162.16
just

2158.619 --> 2164.859
it's the end it's the end really

2162.16 --> 2167.5
because we've basically tapped into the

2164.859 --> 2168.7599999999998
entire design format now of the entire

2167.5 --> 2172.0
process

2168.76 --> 2174.579
of like what the how the globe came into

2172.0 --> 2177.76
being we're figuring it out

2174.579 --> 2179.32
we know what it is how it was designed

2177.76 --> 2182.2000000000003
now

2179.32 --> 2185.28
and it only works ironically because the

2182.2 --> 2185.2799999999997
Earth is actually flat

2185.92 --> 2191.98
and that sounds like a like a joke but

2188.619 --> 2195.94
it isn't and that's the that's the joke

2191.98 --> 2198.7
the joke is it's not a joke yeah huh

2195.94 --> 2202.78
think about that it's the end of the

2198.7 --> 2205.7799999999997
globe it really is like as a

2202.78 --> 2208.1800000000003
as a religion like that

2205.78 --> 2209.619
it can still be an amazing tool and

2208.18 --> 2212.9199999999996
that's why even

2209.619 --> 2216.7000000000003
years ago I started out the idea of a

2212.92 --> 2220.7200000000003
dual cosmogonical Society

2216.7 --> 2223.0
where it could be used as a other layer

2220.72 --> 2226.839
the other layer storytelling and it

2223.0 --> 2230.5
doesn't always have to be just people

2226.839 --> 2232.839
abusing the Innocence right that's what

2230.5 --> 2234.119
seems to be happening now it's a trend

2232.839 --> 2238.599
now with

2234.119 --> 2241.359
globalism demons roaming around

2238.599 --> 2244.92
but that's not how it always was it's

2241.359 --> 2244.92
not how it always has to be

2245.92 --> 2250.96
I think the dream Can Be Tamed

2249.04 --> 2254.4
and there will always be people that

2250.96 --> 2254.4
will believe it's real

2255.64 --> 2261.5789999999997
but there will always be people that

2258.94 --> 2264.76
know it's fake and can still work with

2261.579 --> 2266.98
it and still kind of like entertain

2264.76 --> 2269.44
a matter of perspective how you see that

2266.98 --> 2271.06
word entertain they can entain entertain

2269.44 --> 2274.7200000000003
the globers

2271.06 --> 2276.7
because they know it's a dream and they

2274.72 --> 2280.06
know how that dream works and then you

2276.7 --> 2282.5989999999997
can be well like a globe wizard to Globe

2280.06 --> 2282.599
believers

2284.32 --> 2290.26
and yeah if you want it you can then you

2287.68 --> 2294.0989999999997
abuse that power to condition them to

2290.26 --> 2296.92
become [ __ ] up and evil or you could

2294.099 --> 2300.339
actually use that opportunity

2296.92 --> 2302.14
of being an appointed glow priest to

2300.339 --> 2305.7999999999997
give out

2302.14 --> 2309.339
good and honorable advice

2305.8 --> 2311.38
and help the young ones where they are

2309.339 --> 2314.5
at spiritually

2311.38 --> 2316.7200000000003
with basically climbing that ladder

2314.5 --> 2318.7
climbing that staircase so that

2316.72 --> 2320.859
eventually they might come to a point

2318.7 --> 2323.14
where they figure out wait it's actually

2320.859 --> 2326.44
not a globe

2323.14 --> 2329.2
without going insane

2326.44 --> 2332.26
so it's a challenge

2329.2 --> 2336.64
it's a big human Challenge and I believe

2332.26 --> 2339.2200000000003
it's dual cosmogonica Society has

2336.64 --> 2342.22
has a place in this world

2339.22 --> 2344.5789999999997
but we gotta undo the Demonic Invasion

2342.22 --> 2344.5789999999997
first

2344.98 --> 2349.26
because they're the ones that keep

2346.599 --> 2349.26
ruining it

2349.72 --> 2352.0789999999997
right

2368.859 --> 2372.18
the nonsense is this

2386.92 --> 2393.099
no Ralph Rodriguez no no that you see

2391.24 --> 2395.5
why

2393.099 --> 2398.26
now you're just

2395.5 --> 2401.2
let them have the dream don't do that

2398.26 --> 2402.7000000000003
don't oh a globe channel that turns into

2401.2 --> 2404.56
a flatter no that doesn't work anymore

2402.7 --> 2408.0989999999997
it wouldn't be honest

2404.56 --> 2410.319
they would be catching on to you

2408.099 --> 2412.0
you would already be in the know so

2410.319 --> 2413.8
whatever they try is not going to

2412.0 --> 2416.56
naturally work on you because when a

2413.8 --> 2418.9
global is normally out there

2416.56 --> 2421.359
they will be swarmed by other globers

2418.9 --> 2424.7200000000003
that will test their conditioning if you

2421.359 --> 2427.66
are a flat earther like even I

2424.72 --> 2429.04
could not properly naturally emulate a

2427.66 --> 2431.859
globe

2429.04 --> 2434.2599999999998
like a glober in I couldn't like deep

2431.859 --> 2436.359
dive and then start out as a globe or

2434.26 --> 2437.92
somewhere I wouldn't be able to come on

2436.359 --> 2440.98
camera I have to probably change my

2437.92 --> 2445.599
voice no I'm not going to do that ever

2440.98 --> 2447.88
but if I would do it then even me being

2445.599 --> 2450.819
Bowen I would not be able to actually

2447.88 --> 2454.1800000000003
emulate a natural

2450.819 --> 2456.7
innocent Glover and and everybody that

2454.18 --> 2459.22
would test me in what I would be doing

2456.7 --> 2461.2
there on some new Channel with globe

2459.22 --> 2462.819
Channel they would figure it out they

2461.2 --> 2465.18
would figure out like that's not a real

2462.819 --> 2465.18
Glover

2466.839 --> 2471.94
even though they are numpties it doesn't

2470.2 --> 2473.98
matter they still have the instincts to

2471.94 --> 2475.9
figure that out

2473.98 --> 2479.319
right you can't

2475.9 --> 2482.079
you can't relive the past like that

2479.319 --> 2484.119
it only works if it if it's natural

2482.079 --> 2485.6800000000003
because they will test you they will

2484.119 --> 2487.78
prod you and then they will figure out

2485.68 --> 2489.819
that's not a Glover

2487.78 --> 2491.5
because you don't have the standard

2489.819 --> 2493.42
responses

2491.5 --> 2496.06
and with the Santa's response it's not

2493.42 --> 2499.66
even the the words that will be given

2496.06 --> 2502.0
instead no it's the emotions right the

2499.66 --> 2505.24
emotions are gone they're all Tamed

2502.0 --> 2507.88
because we know it's not a glow and they

2505.24 --> 2510.4199999999996
would figure it out

2507.88 --> 2510.42
anyway

2513.579 --> 2517.8590000000004
yeah hello Nathan Oakley good to see you

2520.839 --> 2524.819
no Super Chat skipper

2531.04 --> 2533.64
right

2544.359 --> 2550.619
right but yeah the the anti-flood

2546.94 --> 2550.619
Earth's are still going to be just

2551.5 --> 2557.04
going nuts

2553.78 --> 2557.0400000000004
this is going to keep going

2558.579 --> 2562.38
because they have nowhere to go

2562.9 --> 2567.42
and they don't know how to step up

2570.099 --> 2576.339
right so some may step out through pure

2573.72 --> 2579.06
self-projected ignorance like a Kumo

2576.339 --> 2579.06
virus here hello

2580.18 --> 2584.56
and there are stars at it they've

2582.64 --> 2586.42
mastered their ignorance they're like

2584.56 --> 2587.7999999999997
true

2586.42 --> 2590.319
peons

2587.8 --> 2592.42
peons of the globe believe

2590.319 --> 2594.94
and they're at peace with it

2592.42 --> 2596.619
they're all Zen with the globe even

2594.94 --> 2598.9
though it makes no sense and when you

2596.619 --> 2602.4
test them they completely crumble or

2598.9 --> 2602.4
they have to joke their way around it

2617.8 --> 2623.28
I'm right here yeah I know that's why I

2620.8 --> 2623.28
brought it up

2629.14 --> 2635.319
look I will just shame you

2633.16 --> 2637.7799999999997
right in front of your face

2635.319 --> 2641.4
or well rather right in front of if

2637.78 --> 2641.4
you're in my chat I will just do that

2641.619 --> 2647.5
because you deserve it right I'm not

2644.319 --> 2650.14
even like saying you're a bad person or

2647.5 --> 2651.46
anything but yeah I will describe you as

2650.14 --> 2654.46
I see it

2651.46 --> 2654.46
yes

2656.5 --> 2662.02
and you have a lot of weaponized

2658.599 --> 2662.02
ignorance so

2664.24 --> 2670.06
right but at least you're not like one

2667.72 --> 2671.68
of these other real anti-flatter at

2670.06 --> 2673.7799999999997
their [ __ ]

2671.68 --> 2675.7599999999998
that is constantly acting like they're

2673.78 --> 2677.7400000000002
smarter than everybody else at least

2675.76 --> 2679.3590000000004
you're not doing that

2677.74 --> 2682.9599999999996
you know

2679.359 --> 2685.859
and that makes you halfway tolerable

2682.96 --> 2685.859
halfway

2697.839 --> 2702.359
see look at that and he's thanking me

2700.18 --> 2702.359
now

2702.76 --> 2706.5
what a world what a world

2710.92 --> 2716.14
right anyway

2713.8 --> 2717.7200000000003
yeah anti-flat earthers really have

2716.14 --> 2719.7999999999997
nowhere to go

2717.72 --> 2721.2999999999997
argumentative wise I mean they can

2719.8 --> 2723.2200000000003
always show up and they can always

2721.3 --> 2725.1400000000003
forget about it

2723.22 --> 2726.4599999999996
you can always forget what happened the

2725.14 --> 2729.2799999999997
previous time

2726.46 --> 2731.92
then it'll be all surprised like what

2729.28 --> 2735.52
why are you bringing this up it only

2731.92 --> 2739.06
happened like 20 times before this but

2735.52 --> 2742.38
I've never expected you to bring it up

2739.06 --> 2742.38
like it's the first time

2752.56 --> 2759.7599999999998
why you make me prove a flat Earth

2756.819 --> 2761.44
that wasn't Einstein

2759.76 --> 2763.98
that was a kumu

2761.44 --> 2763.98
right

2773.26 --> 2777.1600000000003
right

2775.0 --> 2782.16
yeah that's right the anti-flat earthers

2777.16 --> 2782.16
have a great internal reset every day

2783.76 --> 2789.6400000000003
it's like a full memory wipe every day a

2786.819 --> 2792.52
new chance like they're literally born

2789.64 --> 2795.819
every day

2792.52 --> 2799.96
but with their memory they don't

2795.819 --> 2803.44
like my memory is continuous

2799.96 --> 2805.06
that's like throughout my sleep I don't

2803.44 --> 2808.359
change

2805.06 --> 2810.52
my like energy strand Arrangements of

2808.359 --> 2812.94
how I function it doesn't change as I go

2810.52 --> 2812.94
to sleep

2814.359 --> 2818.68
I'm continuous

2816.339 --> 2822.16
but an anti-flat earther needs to

2818.68 --> 2824.14
literally wipe their mind every day

2822.16 --> 2826.18
otherwise they would be just so

2824.14 --> 2828.7599999999998
depressed that they wouldn't get up out

2826.18 --> 2831.18
of bed because it's all ruined so they

2828.76 --> 2834.579
have to then

2831.18 --> 2836.6189999999997
oh oh it doesn't exist anymore oh it's a

2834.579 --> 2839.819
fresh new day new opportunities we can

2836.619 --> 2839.819
do this we can do this

2842.44 --> 2848.2000000000003
they have to do that

2844.119 --> 2851.98
otherwise it's just super depressing

2848.2 --> 2854.9199999999996
right eventually we on the internet as

2851.98 --> 2857.7400000000002
flat earthers will be faced with the

2854.92 --> 2860.319
people that do that why because the ones

2857.74 --> 2862.9599999999996
that can't or don't do that get

2860.319 --> 2864.64
depressed and then go away

2862.96 --> 2866.68
yeah

2864.64 --> 2869.0789999999997
it's true

2866.68 --> 2872.5
so we're always going to be facing the

2869.079 --> 2874.96
ones that do do it because they're fresh

2872.5 --> 2876.46
new day coming back every time like a

2874.96 --> 2879.28
kumu virus

2876.46 --> 2882.099
and others sometimes it takes a little

2879.28 --> 2884.02
longer for somebody to to reset and then

2882.099 --> 2887.02
they do get depressed they have to stay

2884.02 --> 2889.0
away like re-figure out something about

2887.02 --> 2891.7599999999998
their life get some things in order that

2889.0 --> 2894.64
they've postponed sounds familiar uh

2891.76 --> 2897.0400000000004
postponing things right

2894.64 --> 2899.94
and then they come back and they like go

2897.04 --> 2899.94
come back anew

2900.22 --> 2904.48
respawn that's right sometimes the

2902.68 --> 2907.18
respawn takes a little longer they have

2904.48 --> 2908.8
to first like fix some [ __ ] in their

2907.18 --> 2910.98
life that they've been ignoring for too

2908.8 --> 2910.98
long

2936.64 --> 2943.0789999999997
I hate Terror 306 dude you're so hard

2940.059 --> 2943.079
these days man

2954.46 --> 2959.319
but yeah look

2956.38 --> 2961.42
even if he was a mathematician and I

2959.319 --> 2964.0
think that if he's like really in a calm

2961.42 --> 2967.54
spot he is a bit of a mathematician

2964.0 --> 2970.78
a little bit it's just that he hasn't

2967.54 --> 2973.839
integrated his math ability

2970.78 --> 2977.88
with physical reality right so it's more

2973.839 --> 2977.88
like a a kid math

2978.04 --> 2983.38
yeah it's like good as a kid is good in

2981.28 --> 2986.26
math that's kind of the way that I can

2983.38 --> 2988.48
be good at math once I allow myself to

2986.26 --> 2989.7400000000002
tap into it because I I just don't like

2988.48 --> 2991.78
it

2989.74 --> 2993.5789999999997
nakuma virus is probably better at that

2991.78 --> 2996.7000000000003
but yeah as soon as you start tying it

2993.579 --> 2999.04
to physical reality oh it gets confused

2996.7 --> 3000.98
it's not like he can't subtract it's

2999.04 --> 3003.359
just that he

3000.98 --> 3007.68
too distracted

3003.359 --> 3010.44
it would be classified as hdhd

3007.68 --> 3013.0789999999997
ADHD

3010.44 --> 3014.64
back in the day it's like people that

3013.079 --> 3017.2200000000003
they can do it they just get too

3014.64 --> 3020.4
distracted too distracted by their Globe

3017.22 --> 3022.6189999999997
Faith Falling Apart because of reality

3020.4 --> 3024.359
and then they can't use their skills

3022.619 --> 3026.339
anymore you see that only works when

3024.359 --> 3028.44
you're actually focused

3026.339 --> 3030.359
that's the problem so it's not fair to

3028.44 --> 3032.579
say that he can't do math at all it's

3030.359 --> 3036.2999999999997
just that he's he kind of does math like

3032.579 --> 3038.88
a kid can be good at math

3036.3 --> 3041.28
but as soon as you then lay the

3038.88 --> 3044.339
connections with reality and his

3041.28 --> 3046.4
personal responsibility as an adult etc

3044.339 --> 3049.5589999999997
etc yeah that's when

3046.4 --> 3051.78
then it doesn't work anymore it's too

3049.559 --> 3054.6600000000003
tense

3051.78 --> 3057.2400000000002
yeah that's normal

3054.66 --> 3060.0
that's how that works

3057.24 --> 3062.5789999999997
in a way that's how I used to be when I

3060.0 --> 3066.14
was still a global fanatic when I was

3062.579 --> 3066.1400000000003
Baldwin for real

3074.04 --> 3078.7599999999998
I couldn't do 90 minus 50. I just didn't

3077.28 --> 3081.949
want to do it

3078.76 --> 3081.949
[Music]

3118.559 --> 3124.619
someone on YouTube oh someone on YouTube

3121.74 --> 3128.8799999999997
wants to make flat earthers do something

3124.619 --> 3132.02
do they what else this new Lydia logs

3128.88 --> 3132.02
what else is new

3136.44 --> 3145.26
yeah we don't really need to do anything

3140.88 --> 3149.7000000000003
anymore anybody says on the internet

3145.26 --> 3151.6800000000003
really we got proof we got design

3149.7 --> 3154.319
proof

3151.68 --> 3156.839
the globe model only works because the

3154.319 --> 3160.079
Earth is flat

3156.839 --> 3162.48
it doesn't really work but the way it's

3160.079 --> 3164.2400000000002
constructed it only could have been

3162.48 --> 3167.76
constructed and

3164.24 --> 3170.819
seemingly functional because the Earth

3167.76 --> 3172.98
is flat I think after that point it

3170.819 --> 3174.359
doesn't really matter if some numpty out

3172.98 --> 3177.9
there says oh

3174.359 --> 3181.02
oh proof your flat Earth claim oh yeah

3177.9 --> 3183.839
yeah sorry the globe model only works

3181.02 --> 3188.24
because the Earth is flat yeah

3183.839 --> 3188.24
and that's like design fact

3188.579 --> 3193.8
like we cracked the code it's over we

3191.16 --> 3196.16
don't have to prove [ __ ] anymore to

3193.8 --> 3196.1600000000003
anybody

3197.099 --> 3199.819
it's over

3209.339 --> 3214.859
right and if you hey you want an

3212.52 --> 3217.2599999999998
engagement with a flat earther as a

3214.859 --> 3221.54
Glover and you want them to do something

3217.26 --> 3221.5400000000004
okay well that's gonna come with a fee

3221.819 --> 3225.66
some people that fee is higher than with

3224.099 --> 3227.579
others

3225.66 --> 3230.52
right

3227.579 --> 3232.98
but yeah I agree like I'm not gonna come

3230.52 --> 3235.98
on anti-flat Earth or channels anymore

3232.98 --> 3238.579
on invite unless I get paid

3235.98 --> 3238.579
up front

3240.66 --> 3246.3799999999997
and my fee is probably a lot lower than

3243.42 --> 3246.38
anybody else's

3246.42 --> 3249.98
because yeah it's me

3251.599 --> 3256.92
and I actually really like to do that

3254.4 --> 3259.64
it's just that I shouldn't be doing this

3256.92 --> 3259.64
is like a

3264.059 --> 3270.3
this is like a union thing

3267.0 --> 3272.76
it is it's a union thing I can't just go

3270.3 --> 3274.44
out there anymore and and give away my

3272.76 --> 3275.8190000000004
skills that I've attained on Flat Earth

3274.44 --> 3278.46
debate

3275.819 --> 3280.38
to an anti-flat earther

3278.46 --> 3284.16
for them to wreck it

3280.38 --> 3286.92
and just get more clicks and funding and

3284.16 --> 3289.5
legitimacy for their existence

3286.92 --> 3292.26
right I can't do that anymore for free

3289.5 --> 3295.14
it's a union thing if I do that I'd ruin

3292.26 --> 3298.38
it for everybody else

3295.14 --> 3300.5989999999997
so yeah I will require a fee to do that

3298.38 --> 3302.1600000000003
but nobody's going to invite me and pay

3300.599 --> 3303.96
me for that because how would they

3302.16 --> 3307.319
justify that to themselves in the world

3303.96 --> 3310.079
like yeah I just paid Arwin

3307.319 --> 3311.7599999999998
as a globally right paid Arwin to come

3310.079 --> 3315.42
on and give him

3311.76 --> 3317.88
and have him give us flattered expertise

3315.42 --> 3320.339
that's that's they can't justify like

3317.88 --> 3323.04
maybe with a guy like Brian or something

3320.339 --> 3325.319
who's really like a technical

3323.04 --> 3327.839
detail expert

3325.319 --> 3329.7599999999998
but with me like how would they justify

3327.839 --> 3332.16
them

3329.76 --> 3333.7200000000003
but I do it

3332.16 --> 3338.24
heck

3333.72 --> 3338.24
why not but it's gonna cost

3350.819 --> 3355.579
just passing on the info that's fine

3352.5 --> 3355.579
Lydia that's fine

3357.599 --> 3361.44
thank you for passing that on I kind of

3359.819 --> 3363.7799999999997
knew that because what was it yesterday

3361.44 --> 3366.2400000000002
or the day before

3363.78 --> 3368.099
there was a baller in my chat basically

3366.24 --> 3370.799
saying that

3368.099 --> 3373.619
was talking about that how we wanted to

3370.799 --> 3377.04
like oh would you

3373.619 --> 3380.6400000000003
if I sent you a sexton then

3377.04 --> 3383.24
will you prove Flat Earth with it

3380.64 --> 3383.24
so

3384.78 --> 3388.7000000000003
a science work in mysterious ways

3392.4 --> 3395.9
I'm gonna give you a wrench

3399.9 --> 3406.04
and you get one too

3403.079 --> 3406.04
it's wrench day

3425.52 --> 3428.059
right

3432.359 --> 3434.359
um

3446.76 --> 3450.619
because Godzilla have a wrench

3450.72 --> 3455.64
no I didn't weird not now he's a member

3453.839 --> 3458.9
any as a wrench

3455.64 --> 3458.9
I wonder what that'll look like

3470.54 --> 3478.16
ah right yeah you still get to see the

3474.42 --> 3478.16
little symbol cool

3492.18 --> 3498.0789999999997
yeah Kumo virus we know we know he is

3502.319 --> 3506.48
Bobby is a bit of a creepy stalker

3508.799 --> 3513.799
he really is that's just fine

3514.68 --> 3520.74
it gets annoying I'll just ban him

3519.059 --> 3524.119
until he gets back with some new

3520.74 --> 3524.1189999999997
infiltration sock

3527.5 --> 3530.619
[Music]

3540.359 --> 3545.72
just love your show yeah bet you do

3547.68 --> 3552.2
although I don't really understand why

3552.359 --> 3555.14
do you

3569.579 --> 3572.1800000000003
right

3582.42 --> 3587.78
hmm right so yeah let's move on

3587.88 --> 3591.799
see what else is going on in the world

3601.319 --> 3607.099
oh

3603.48 --> 3607.099
that's that's cool

3612.2 --> 3618.4199999999996
Trump actually

3614.66 --> 3621.48
made an official statement now he told

3618.42 --> 3624.599
Joe Rogan to stop apologizing

3621.48 --> 3628.02
and still be expected

3624.599 --> 3630.7200000000003
because that was ridiculous

3628.02 --> 3634.46
I think I think Joe Rogan is doing like

3630.72 --> 3634.4599999999996
a a toe operation

3634.799 --> 3639.66
he's he's just doing a little [ __ ]

3637.559 --> 3642.26
wizard thing

3639.66 --> 3642.2599999999998
the crowd

3653.46 --> 3659.299
yeah I'm gonna coin that phrase toe up

3663.42 --> 3665.42
um

3679.339 --> 3686.24
would I be going so too far as calling

3683.04 --> 3686.24
Trump a terrorist

3686.28 --> 3691.2000000000003
yeah

3688.799 --> 3693.299
yeah that would be too far that's kind

3691.2 --> 3696.8999999999996
of ridiculous

3693.299 --> 3700.68
but yeah if you'd call him a shill

3696.9 --> 3702.299
and in deep doo doo because of it yeah

3700.68 --> 3706.0789999999997
I'd go with you

3702.299 --> 3709.2599999999998
right I got hashtag Trump is a shield

3706.079 --> 3713.2400000000002
in in the list of hashtags in every show

3709.26 --> 3713.2400000000002
so yeah it's there for a good reason

3714.66 --> 3720.98
terrorist no

3717.839 --> 3720.98
it's not even his style

3736.799 --> 3742.2599999999998
wait what

3739.2 --> 3745.16
Ralph is offering money what are you

3742.26 --> 3745.1600000000003
talking about Lydia

3755.7 --> 3758.5989999999997
okay

3764.16 --> 3767.94
called Trump owned you could call it

3766.859 --> 3769.44
that

3767.94 --> 3772.68
but

3769.44 --> 3775.5
yeah the only time will tell

3772.68 --> 3777.839
maybe his own maybe is really like a

3775.5 --> 3781.02
Darth Vader

3777.839 --> 3785.339
like General in the yeah in the Sith

3781.02 --> 3789.18
Lord control hierarchy now maybe is that

3785.339 --> 3791.52
or maybe he's just kind of like yeah

3789.18 --> 3792.8999999999996
he made a mistake and he stuck to it

3791.52 --> 3794.819
it's like if he's gonna do something

3792.9 --> 3797.1600000000003
he's gonna do it great

3794.819 --> 3799.079
even though that's absolutely wrecking

3797.16 --> 3800.819
everything he's doing

3799.079 --> 3803.1600000000003
right

3800.819 --> 3805.2599999999998
at best he's making a very foolish

3803.16 --> 3807.48
mistake

3805.26 --> 3810.8390000000004
with this whole

3807.48 --> 3814.38
yeah big Pharma shilling

3810.839 --> 3815.5789999999997
that's just terrible but yeah terrorists

3814.38 --> 3817.579
no

3815.579 --> 3817.579
no

3818.76 --> 3823.26
he's not doing that even the way he is

3820.92 --> 3825.78
chilling for them is not threatening

3823.26 --> 3827.46
he's always like yeah freedom and oh

3825.78 --> 3829.799
they're so good he's just trying to sell

3827.46 --> 3830.76
it even though it has no ground to be

3829.799 --> 3833.52
sold

3830.76 --> 3836.88
right he's not forcing it he's not it's

3833.52 --> 3841.4
just no just no he's not a terrorist

3836.88 --> 3841.4
ridiculous ridiculous to say that

3846.72 --> 3851.8999999999996
please stop doing that

3848.64 --> 3851.9
that would be appreciated

3868.799 --> 3874.0389999999998
he smacks of an old industrial list type

3871.68 --> 3874.0389999999998
yeah

3874.619 --> 3881.2400000000002
yeah he is

3876.539 --> 3881.2400000000002
that's his style that's what he can do

3919.44 --> 3926.2200000000003
so it goes both ways doesn't it what are

3923.28 --> 3930.2400000000002
you talking about Lydia

3926.22 --> 3933.68
I don't want anti-flat earthers on with

3930.24 --> 3933.68
me on my show

3937.98 --> 3943.02
they want us to come over so they can

3940.559 --> 3944.039
make fun of us and try to make us look

3943.02 --> 3945.299
stupid

3944.039 --> 3948.2990000000004
right

3945.299 --> 3951.18
that's what they want so that makes the

3948.299 --> 3953.819
market in my favor I'm gonna charge

3951.18 --> 3955.319
I don't want them on my show who gives a

3953.819 --> 3957.0589999999997
[ __ ]

3955.319 --> 3957.839
they'll be lucky if they're not kicked

3957.059 --> 3960.8590000000004
out

3957.839 --> 3960.859
of my chat

3963.72 --> 3967.9199999999996
like they can try to charge me and then

3966.0 --> 3970.099
they'll say yeah thanks decline now [ __ ]

3967.92 --> 3970.099
off

3970.52 --> 3973.7
come on

3989.7 --> 3993.3799999999997
nobody will pay that's right

3994.5 --> 3998.88
probably nobody

3996.539 --> 4001.3390000000004
but they might be tempted at some point

3998.88 --> 4003.2000000000003
because they have nowhere else to go

4001.339 --> 4005.0589999999997
right

4003.2 --> 4010.7
we sit here

4005.059 --> 4015.2000000000003
in a spiritual place of supreme ruler

4010.7 --> 4017.96
we rule over the globe We Rule the minds

4015.2 --> 4020.4199999999996
of the people that believe that because

4017.96 --> 4021.2
we know exactly what it is they believe

4020.42 --> 4024.2000000000003
in

4021.2 --> 4028.0389999999998
and how and why

4024.2 --> 4031.0589999999997
they have no power over us at all except

4028.039 --> 4031.059
being a nuisance

4031.94 --> 4036.799
but yeah that means eventually that they

4034.819 --> 4038.66
might just kind of be

4036.799 --> 4040.88
forced

4038.66 --> 4042.5
like either it's going to be so boring

4040.88 --> 4044.42
there's will be nothing left to talk

4042.5 --> 4046.039
about so they're going to start poking

4044.42 --> 4048.619
it's kind of what Sean Hawkins has been

4046.039 --> 4051.6800000000003
doing for years now

4048.619 --> 4055.78
because he has nowhere else to go

4059.96 --> 4068.18
you start poking flat earthers all that

4062.78 --> 4071.2000000000003
means they need us so that means pay up

4068.18 --> 4071.2
you're gonna have to

4071.599 --> 4074.6600000000003
pay your

church

4094.339 --> 4099.5
I am the master of your belief

4098.0 --> 4102.02
right that's not the other way around

4099.5 --> 4106.659
they have no Mastery over anything that

4102.02 --> 4106.659000000001
I would join their Church on

4114.679 --> 4118.6

yeah that's hilarious hello seeking star

4138.02 --> 4140.679
Water by the way

4150.199 --> 4153.739
yeah Caroline a well that's the whole

4152.54 --> 4158.0
point

4153.739 --> 4161.9
they have to do it because they know

4158.0 --> 4164.299
that it that's that it's gonna break

4161.9 --> 4167.7789999999995
that they're not gonna be

4164.299 --> 4169.5199999999995
the guy in that nice group where they

4167.779 --> 4173.179
can have authority because they know

4169.52 --> 4175.279
every little squirty Globe detail

4173.179 --> 4178.46
right that's what they wanted they

4175.279 --> 4181.339000000001
wanted Mastery over that domain

4178.46 --> 4184.58
but it's been dispelled

4181.339 --> 4188.799
it's not going to be undispelled

4184.58 --> 4188.799
can only be temporarily covered

4188.9 --> 4194.0599999999995
so they have to constantly keep proving

4192.44 --> 4197.36
the globe

4194.06 --> 4199.76
not to Gaslight the public not to

4197.36 --> 4201.92
convince the public really it's to

4199.76 --> 4203.0
convince themselves

4201.92 --> 4205.6990000000005
right

4203.0 --> 4206.78
they're the ones that are constantly in

4205.699 --> 4209.5599999999995
doubt

4206.78 --> 4209.5599999999995
about it

4215.06 --> 4219.620000000001
they're just not willing to relinquish

4217.28 --> 4222.259999999999
that doubt they hope

4219.62 --> 4224.9
that what they probably hope is that

4222.26 --> 4227.38
flat earthers will get really interested

4224.9 --> 4227.379999999999
in them

4227.659 --> 4233.36
because of their doubt because of their

4230.6 --> 4235.159000000001
Globe fanaticism and like they hope that

4233.36 --> 4238.639999999999
flat earthers will come in and try to

4235.159 --> 4241.099999999999
convert them to their side and then they

4238.64 --> 4243.7390000000005
bring a whole bunch of weird book of

4241.1 --> 4244.9400000000005
tricks that you don't get to see that

4243.739 --> 4248.0599999999995
often

4244.94 --> 4251.36
it gets pretty [ __ ] up

4248.06 --> 4254.42
where they will try to basically pull

4251.36 --> 4257.839999999999
the rug from underneath those engaging

4254.42 --> 4260.42
and then force them in kind of a stupor

4257.84 --> 4264.9400000000005
and then make them align to their side

4260.42 --> 4264.9400000000005
in the stupor it's pathetic

4268.64 --> 4277.76
they are just clinically

4272.679 --> 4280.4
systematically chronically deranged

4277.76 --> 4283.900000000001
their entire social way of being is

4280.4 --> 4283.9
completely deranged

[Music]

4302.12 --> 4305.42
what happened to Mr sensible I don't

4303.92 --> 4309.32
know

4305.42 --> 4311.12
I don't know Terra 306.

4309.32 --> 4313.48
I haven't heard from him and he might

4311.12 --> 4313.48
just be

4314.48 --> 4320.08
sitting somewhere in an urn right now I

4317.78 --> 4320.08
don't know

4337.219 --> 4340.6
oh he's still there okay

4341.12 --> 4346.76
right because he has been taking jabies

4343.699 --> 4349.5199999999995
so yeah that's it could just be over

4346.76 --> 4352.900000000001
just like that

4349.52 --> 4352.900000000001
you see now it happens

4353.06 --> 4359.92
just boom and they're dead so you never

4357.44 --> 4359.919999999999
really know

4359.96 --> 4364.179
but he's still around apparently all

4361.94 --> 4364.178999999999
right

4371.48 --> 4374.199
okay

4377.26 --> 4382.12
somebody's sanding

4379.4 --> 4382.12
wood

4386.06 --> 4389.679
what's the main project

4390.38 --> 4394.34
it's him sending up a balloon and then

4392.42 --> 4398.7390000000005
claiming that he's seeing Earth curve

4394.34 --> 4398.7390000000005
which he is in its it's pathetic

4415.28 --> 4417.5199999999995
foreign

4437.06 --> 4440.06
anyway

4441.32 --> 4444.58
what else can I talk about

4447.8 --> 4450.219
foreign

4456.58 --> 4463.42
did anybody actually check out this

4459.62 --> 4463.42
video probably not

4475.1 --> 4477.34
foreign

4484.64 --> 4488.38
posted it on my birthday

4489.44 --> 4493.0
it's pretty freaky

4495.739 --> 4500.259999999999
don't go obsessing over it please

4505.1 --> 4509.659000000001
that's all it wants

4507.5 --> 4512.38
but I thought it was pretty revealing

4509.659 --> 4512.379999999999
though this video

4518.84 --> 4524.179
Ralph Rodriguez like no

4521.659 --> 4526.28
it's all relative That was supposed to

4524.179 --> 4528.7390000000005
fix everything Einstein said it's all

4526.28 --> 4530.42
relative that fixed it right that means

4528.739 --> 4533.839999999999
you don't have to think about freaking

4530.42 --> 4536.719
moving things constantly

4533.84 --> 4541.6
that was the point

4536.719 --> 4541.6
because it's a mess it can't work

4542.78 --> 4546.699
it can only be stationary

4547.159 --> 4551.139999999999
if it's not stationary it doesn't work

4551.3 --> 4554.6
and gravity is not going to fix anything

4553.159 --> 4556.58
because

4554.6 --> 4560.06
even if you think gravity is a force

4556.58 --> 4564.64
that's not gonna change

4560.06 --> 4564.64
things like momentum it doesn't

4571.46 --> 4578.92
that's why folk holds pension oh my god

4574.58 --> 4578.92
really Andy Woods really

4579.28 --> 4585.8
faux chords pendulum

4582.44 --> 4588.08
you know it's just a pendulum right it's

4585.8 --> 4591.02
just a pendulum

4588.08 --> 4592.94
the entire thing is about it is you

4591.02 --> 4595.46
swing up the pendulum

4592.94 --> 4599.12
then you say look

4595.46 --> 4600.92
imagine the Earth is spinning underneath

4599.12 --> 4603.92
it

4600.92 --> 4606.4400000000005
that's it that's what it is that's it's

4603.92 --> 4609.4400000000005
just a hypnosis thing

4606.44 --> 4611.78
it doesn't prove anything

4609.44 --> 4616.699
and even the things they say about it

4611.78 --> 4621.08
are just straight out lies straight out

4616.699 --> 4623.96
lies it never starts spinning it never

4621.08 --> 4626.42
just starts swinging it never just

4623.96 --> 4628.82
starts deviating into a certain pattern

4626.42 --> 4630.38
that doesn't happen it's just being

4628.82 --> 4633.5599999999995
sworn

4630.38 --> 4635.4800000000005
given a swing by a person and then just

4633.56 --> 4637.52
say look at this

4635.48 --> 4639.44
see now imagine how the Earth is

4637.52 --> 4643.159000000001
spinning underneath it that's it that's

4639.44 --> 4646.639999999999
the foe called pendulum that's why I

4643.159 --> 4648.799999999999
think it should be spelled differently

4646.64 --> 4650.7300000000005
should be spelled

4648.8 --> 4653.92
like this

4650.73 --> 4653.919999999999
[Applause]

4669.92 --> 4675.4
yeah that's what I meant Lydia logs

4672.38 --> 4675.400000000001
don't be pedantic

4675.64 --> 4680.719
[Music]

4676.84 --> 4683.2390000000005
I immediately corrected that all right

4680.719 --> 4686.4800000000005
it doesn't do that though nothing

4683.239 --> 4689.36
changes it doesn't deviate

4686.48 --> 4691.04
the point is not a point it doesn't do

4689.36 --> 4694.12
that ever

4691.04 --> 4694.12
it's a lie

4707.06 --> 4710.7390000000005
[ __ ] off Angela

4711.199 --> 4717.5199999999995
yeah you could call it that too

4713.659 --> 4717.5199999999995
it's pretty appropriate really

4720.08 --> 4727.659
I've seen

4722.3 --> 4727.659000000001
create oh sure you did

4730.699 --> 4736.04
right well if you want to believe that

4733.219 --> 4738.26
[ __ ] stupid hypnosis trick is

4736.04 --> 4740.54
actually proof of Earth spinning then

4738.26 --> 4741.56
you go right ahead I'm not gonna stop

4740.54 --> 4743.78
you

4741.56 --> 4746.7390000000005
when somebody says that something that

4743.78 --> 4750.5599999999995
stupid it makes me go yes

4746.739 --> 4753.739
yes go there go and stare at the

4750.56 --> 4755.42
pendulum oh take some more jabbies

4753.739 --> 4758.239
while you're at it

4755.42 --> 4761.719
yeah you want to believe something that

4758.239 --> 4765.259999999999
[ __ ] stupid then go ahead

4761.719 --> 4768.4
not gonna stop you Dino Crisis

4765.26 --> 4768.400000000001
not gonna stop you

4777.62 --> 4781.84
it's procession no there wasn't

4781.88 --> 4789.400000000001
it doesn't happen if you swing a

4784.94 --> 4789.4
pendulum in a perfect straight line

4789.62 --> 4796.64
it's gonna stay like that no earth spin

4793.4 --> 4798.5
is gonna change its course unless there

4796.64 --> 4800.780000000001
is literally

4798.5 --> 4803.48
engine based

4800.78 --> 4807.139
like Electro

4803.48 --> 4809.839999999999
push magnetic push something in the

4807.139 --> 4813.7390000000005
swing to make it do that

4809.84 --> 4817.219
cause swings never do that right you

4813.739 --> 4820.099999999999
don't need a special super big focal

4817.219 --> 4823.04
pendulum to do that just a pendulum

4820.1 --> 4824.4800000000005
that's the point a pendulum yeah you

4823.04 --> 4827.42
swing it

4824.48 --> 4829.28
it doesn't deviate it doesn't do that it

4827.42 --> 4831.5
never does that that's the point that's

4829.28 --> 4835.58
the focal pendulum it's not that big

4831.5 --> 4839.06
device that they can engineer to rig to

4835.58 --> 4842.139
start yeah deviating like that

4839.06 --> 4842.139
oh garbage

4844.4 --> 4850.46
it's a pendulum

4846.56 --> 4853.219
right why did you just take a pendulum a

4850.46 --> 4855.139
pendulum right the suggestion is because

4853.219 --> 4858.32
the Earth spins underneath it it's going

4855.139 --> 4863.06
to do that thing right well guess what

4858.32 --> 4866.0599999999995
they don't pendulums don't do that

4863.06 --> 4868.179
it's stupid if you believe that you're a

4866.06 --> 4872.0
[ __ ]

4868.179 --> 4875.54
pendulums are rigged it's rigged garbage

4872.0 --> 4878.86
oh the thing is way too big anyway it

4875.54 --> 4878.86
doesn't make any freaking sense

4880.76 --> 4886.400000000001
why don't you just use a pendulum that's

4883.639 --> 4888.9800000000005
the point right a pendulum or it has to

4886.4 --> 4893.679
be that special pendulum

4888.98 --> 4893.678999999999
oh no a pendulum

4893.84 --> 4899.38
and pendulums don't do that

4896.719 --> 4899.38
fact

4910.46 --> 4914.679
oh my God look at that

4915.5 --> 4918.76
what a numpty

4919.639 --> 4924.9890000000005
it's a swing very long time

4921.85 --> 4924.9890000000005

4954.02 --> 4960.1990000000005
I'm sorry dino Christ I can't I can't

4957.38 --> 4962.12
say anything more creative to that it's

4960.199 --> 4965.12
just [ __ ]

4962.12 --> 4968.139
you believe that [ __ ] it's really

4965.12 --> 4968.139
[ __ ] dumb

4971.96 --> 4978.199
doesn't deviate because the Earth is

4975.44 --> 4980.239
spinning Dino Crisis

4978.199 --> 4983.299999999999
doesn't do that

4980.239 --> 4986.54
Earth isn't spinning

4983.3 --> 4989.8
the consequences of Earth being able and

4986.54 --> 4993.44
spinning would be Monumental it would be

4989.8 --> 4995.54
everywhere everywhere constantly all the

4993.44 --> 4999.0199999999995
time there isn't any

4995.54 --> 5001.36
right we got drones we got hot air

4999.02 --> 5004.6
balloons they stay in their place

5001.36 --> 5007.36
yeah Earth is not spinning your stupid

5004.6 --> 5009.84
little pendulum is not proving it don't

5007.36 --> 5009.839999999999
you get it

5010.98 --> 5015.28
they keep chanting for me funny keep

5013.6 --> 5018.34
chanting

5015.28 --> 5021.04
the Earth is not spinning

5018.34 --> 5024.9400000000005
whatever you saw you think you saw with

5021.04 --> 5027.58
this stupid pendulum thing

5024.94 --> 5029.259999999999
Earth is not spinning it doesn't prove

5027.58 --> 5032.4
it

5029.26 --> 5032.400000000001
don't you get it

5035.139 --> 5037.8
[ __ ] out of here

5075.06 --> 5081.6
Diner is only one day out yeah he's just

5078.82 --> 5081.599999999999
an idiot suck

5089.199 --> 5094.12
foreign

5091.3 --> 5096.52
but yeah dude I don't care man you can

5094.12 --> 5098.739
just say his [ __ ] about his stupid

5096.52 --> 5100.900000000001
little pendulum all he likes it's

5098.739 --> 5103.839999999999
[ __ ]

5100.9 --> 5105.58
the Earth is not spinning it isn't

5103.84 --> 5108.46
if it would be spinning we would see

5105.58 --> 5110.5
coriola's deviation on the Earth

5108.46 --> 5113.199
we don't

5110.5 --> 5115.84
it's stationary it has to be stationary

5113.199 --> 5119.199
nothing would be the way it actually is

no coriolis deviation because Earth

isn't spinning underneath

the atmosphere and whatever you want to

like Siri what the [ __ ] are you talking

5169.0 --> 5172.139
about geoshifter

[ __ ] claim assertions never end

5259.0 --> 5264.58
today they always just draw in more

things that are curious and then make

I mean who comes up with that

5294.88 --> 5300.28
who would say

5296.679 --> 5305.26
like ooh focal pendulum oh yeah oh

5300.28 --> 5308.62
during the eclipse it stops spinning

5305.26 --> 5311.5
who the [ __ ] comes up with that [ __ ] and

5308.62 --> 5314.5
why do people just buy that

why

5320.38 --> 5323.04
a laser

foreign

5501.96 --> 5508.42
whoa okay sorry snowbirds I was actually

5506.08 --> 5510.159
muted

5508.42 --> 5512.26
weird

5510.159 --> 5515.699
I have no idea how that happened I

5512.26 --> 5515.6990000000005
hadn't even touched my mic

5516.699 --> 5525.28
dude was it [ __ ] muted all this

[ __ ] time I hate this freaking mic

5525.28 --> 5530.62
always doing this [ __ ] connection

5527.8 --> 5532.900000000001
freaking wires why can't you just have a

[ __ ] wire that just stays [ __ ]

5532.9 --> 5536.679
connected and doesn't randomly

5534.88 --> 5540.0
disconnect

5536.679 --> 5540.0
piece of [ __ ]

5542.98 --> 5545.699
the hell

5546.04 --> 5550.54
right yeah I looked at the LA effect

5548.32 --> 5552.699
it's the weirdest [ __ ] thing I've

5550.54 --> 5556.36
ever seen

5552.699 --> 5560.799999999999
and apparently all of that speech I had

5556.36 --> 5563.639
is just completely gone thanks [ __ ]

5560.8 --> 5563.639
[ __ ] equipment

5565.9 --> 5574.5
right so yeah it's something apparently

5569.32 --> 5574.5
it's really really [ __ ] weird

5576.94 --> 5580.9
it's weird enough that I'm probably I'm

5578.98 --> 5584.0199999999995
gonna try to bring it up during the Flat

5580.9 --> 5586.44
Earth debates because this is weird as

5584.02 --> 5586.4400000000005
[ __ ]

5587.639 --> 5594.639
it's not absolutely not proof of

5591.4 --> 5597.42
gravitation it's absolutely not proof of

5594.639 --> 5601.12
earth spin it's not proof of anything

5597.42 --> 5603.28
heliocentric but apparently it's really

5601.12 --> 5605.98
weird

5603.28 --> 5607.78
ly enough there is a claim and there

5605.98 --> 5612.339999999999
have been tests

5607.78 --> 5614.0199999999995
about how a freaking solar eclipse makes

5612.34 --> 5615.76
pendulums

5614.02 --> 5618.52
like deviate

5615.76 --> 5621.84
out of nowhere that's like really

5618.52 --> 5621.84
[ __ ] weird man

5622.12 --> 5626.34
like absolutely weird

5629.26 --> 5633.76
like

5630.52 --> 5635.7390000000005
so freaking I'm weirded out by this I've

5633.76 --> 5639.88
never heard anything like this before

5635.739 --> 5642.839999999999
it's really freaky like why the [ __ ]

5639.88 --> 5642.84
does that happen

5646.84 --> 5649.84
foreign

5654.9 --> 5658.739
to you what

5662.98 --> 5670.0
well the whole page the delays effect on

5666.88 --> 5672.88
Wiki is all clubs credit all the

5670.0 --> 5675.159
gravitational wave black graphic meter

5672.88 --> 5677.02
blah blah blah blah

5675.159 --> 5679.179
it's all garbage

5677.02 --> 5681.88
and they even say inconclusive or

5679.179 --> 5684.52
negative results so that's not good but

5681.88 --> 5687.28
the thing that there even is

5684.52 --> 5690.179
something that happens

5687.28 --> 5693.84
during the eclipse is just freaking

5690.179 --> 5693.84
freaking weird

5694.9 --> 5698.04
really bizarre

5709.179 --> 5712.179
alleged

5717.1 --> 5722.76
right so yeah I haven't completely read

5720.1 --> 5726.280000000001
through it yet because it's kind of big

5722.76 --> 5729.219
but if you guys are saying on

5726.28 --> 5731.259999999999
preliminary feel out that it's kind of

5729.219 --> 5733.119
like the Cavendish test

5731.26 --> 5735.52
I wouldn't be surprised it does kind of

5733.119 --> 5738.119
look like it like it's similar like

5735.52 --> 5741.400000000001
[ __ ] around with equipment

5738.119 --> 5743.92
it's not a like it's not Natural Science

5741.4 --> 5746.679
for sure but like

5743.92 --> 5749.56
does anything like that actually happen

5746.679 --> 5752.32
that's really weird if it does

5749.56 --> 5755.92
like that's like

5752.32 --> 5758.5
like me getting scared weird because I

5755.92 --> 5761.26
have no idea how that could be

5758.5 --> 5764.92
I have no clue

5761.26 --> 5766.9800000000005
from my knowledge perspective like what

5764.92 --> 5766.9800000000005
what

5767.26 --> 5772.679
that doesn't make any sense with

5769.06 --> 5772.679
anything that I figured out

5774.58 --> 5778.8
right so you think it's just a mock-off

5783.84 --> 5789.76
right I I want to hear out the guys on

5787.3 --> 5793.0
fed over it

5789.76 --> 5795.52
maybe they they've got some reason Maybe

5793.0 --> 5796.83
uh Quantum eraser knows something about

5795.52 --> 5798.6990000000005
it

5796.83 --> 5801.04

5798.699 --> 5803.379999999999

5941.139 --> 5943.679

good cool show overall

5951.34 --> 5957.34

5955.0 --> 5960.639
then moving on to anti-flat Earth

5957.34 --> 5962.9800000000005
there's a bit of psychology and all that

5960.639 --> 5966.1
and then ending up with this La effect

5962.98 --> 5968.5599999999995
that I've never heard of weird

5966.1 --> 5971.139
