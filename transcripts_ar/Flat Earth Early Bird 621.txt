so as you can probably guess today is

81.28 --> 88.56
hot it's really

84.84 --> 90.32000000000001
hot and i think it's also a lot more

88.56 --> 94.07900000000001
moist

90.32 --> 96.79899999999999
or something because yeah these aren't

94.079 --> 97.6
chemtrails pretty sure they are by the

96.799 --> 102.159
shape of them

97.6 --> 104.15899999999999
and see our lines

102.159 --> 106.96000000000001
and i saw them being dropped this

104.159 --> 109.43900000000001
morning pretty much

106.96 --> 110.399
and yeah it was already pretty hot in

109.439 --> 112.479
the morning

110.399 --> 113.759
clear sky with hot and then yeah with

112.479 --> 117.52
this not

113.759 --> 119.439
don't think it's getting any less so

117.52 --> 120.96
it's just really hot there's a lot of

119.439 --> 123.439
people out

120.96 --> 124.479
and like even over over there at the

123.439 --> 126.79899999999999
river

124.479 --> 127.67999999999999
they're literally just like jumping from

126.799 --> 129.75900000000001
their boats

127.68 --> 131.03900000000002
and all that in in the water because

129.759 --> 134.39999999999998
yeah this is just

131.039 --> 134.39999999999998
super super hot i don't know

135.76 --> 142.72
could be somewhere around 38 or

139.44 --> 144.16
40 if i'd have to guess i haven't

142.72 --> 148.239
checked it you know what i will

144.16 --> 149.85
check it uh

148.239 --> 153.03900000000002
let's see

149.85 --> 153.039
[Music]

155.44 --> 163.28
oh okay 29 degrees

160.4 --> 164.959
right just goes to show i'm not good at

163.28 --> 169.599
sizing up temperatures

164.959 --> 169.599
it's really hot it's hot to me

169.84 --> 175.84
maybe it's also because again yeah

172.959 --> 177.68
right before two o'clock i get directly

175.84 --> 179.599
hit by the sun

177.68 --> 182.56
so it's probably a little bit more hot

179.599 --> 183.92
on average in here than it is

182.56 --> 185.92000000000002
well wherever they're measuring the

183.92 --> 186.72
average temperature it is the shadow

185.92 --> 188.23999999999998
temperature

186.72 --> 189.76
what they measure if i

188.24 --> 193.36
[Music]

189.76 --> 193.35999999999999
remember correctly anyway

196.56 --> 203.599
show off those guns and what guns right

200.4 --> 207.28
uh so no tea no coffee today

203.599 --> 210.64
not gonna do that but i did get some

207.28 --> 212.959
lemon juice freshly squeezed lemon juice

210.64 --> 215.35999999999999
with some honey in it and kept it in the

212.959 --> 215.36
cooler

219.76 --> 226.159
oh that's just excellent

223.12 --> 230.56
i wish i had some more

226.159 --> 232.56
but yeah still gonna have a glass

230.56 --> 235.28
yeah that fresh lemon is re it really

232.56 --> 235.28
does the trick

237.04 --> 245.92
so let's see who is in chat

241.12 --> 251.439
amanda jung was first martin tolberg

245.92 --> 251.439

all

292.24 --> 301.28000000000003
right that's pretty good crowd starter

297.759 --> 304.84000000000003
thursday first thursday

301.28 --> 308.08
of august the 6th

304.84 --> 312.15999999999997
2020 and it's hot

308.08 --> 314.8
over here like

312.16 --> 316.8
yeah well it's probably gonna get less

314.8 --> 318.639
hot but if it would stay this hot then

316.8 --> 319.36
eventually like after the show i just go

318.639 --> 321.12
out and

319.36 --> 322.56
take a jump in that river too like i

321.12 --> 325.199
wouldn't care

322.56 --> 326.88
or maybe take a cold shower probably a

325.199 --> 330.08000000000004
little easier

326.88 --> 333.36
that's dirty but yeah it's just so hot

330.08 --> 334.56
so excuse me if i seem a little

333.36 --> 336.88
knackered

334.56 --> 338.0
on average today or out of breath it's

336.88 --> 342.24
just it's really

338.0 --> 348.479
hot so like you guys get it now

342.24 --> 348.479
right so it was quite active yesterday

349.26 --> 353.199
[Music]

350.84 --> 355.52
uh didn't watch any

353.199 --> 356.88
oh wait i did watch a movie didn't make

355.52 --> 360.639
a note of it

356.88 --> 363.199
let me do that uh

360.639 --> 367.07
ah thank you good servant for the 99

363.199 --> 370.29
cent super chat donation

367.07 --> 370.29
[Music]

378.84 --> 384.31899999999996
right

381.039 --> 384.31899999999996
so yeah yesterday

384.88 --> 392.84
flat earth debate after show

388.0 --> 396.08
it's really good i stayed the whole way

392.84 --> 399.52
until uh yeah until it ended

396.08 --> 401.19899999999996
i waited for my newspaper rounds because

399.52 --> 403.75899999999996
yeah i couldn't really stepped away it

401.199 --> 405.759
was really good

403.759 --> 408.88
you checked out the histocrat channel

405.759 --> 412.16
did you

408.88 --> 415.84
did you also check out my audiobook

412.16 --> 418.96000000000004
anyway yeah i did also watch back the

415.84 --> 420.71999999999997
the history thing

418.96 --> 422.96
i didn't even make a note of that that's

420.72 --> 425.91900000000004
just silly

422.96 --> 427.75899999999996
that's so weird but i did watch a lot

425.919 --> 431.28
bigger part of it and it just

427.759 --> 434.8
seemed it got kind of boring

431.28 --> 438.79999999999995
because it was just very consecutive

434.8 --> 440.96000000000004
the history as they figured it out

438.8 --> 442.639
and eventually you know what it didn't

440.96 --> 444.79999999999995
even say that much about the whole

442.639 --> 450.40000000000003
druids and all that

444.8 --> 452.40000000000003
so yeah it

450.4 --> 453.75899999999996
it's kind of good because like the

452.4 --> 455.67999999999995
baseline structure of

453.759 --> 457.36
all that yeah i did get that even in

455.68 --> 459.28000000000003
school and everything and i was really

457.36 --> 462.40000000000003
interested at the time

459.28 --> 466.31899999999996
so like it sounded familiar but

462.4 --> 469.19899999999996
to be fair i don't fully trust

466.319 --> 470.72
that approach anymore because i have my

469.199 --> 474.08000000000004
doubts with the entire

470.72 --> 476.0
roman empire situation i think it might

474.08 --> 479.12
have been actually something else

476.0 --> 480.72
or a cover i i don't know it's

479.12 --> 484.639
it's just that i have many suspicions

480.72 --> 486.96000000000004
with official history with these matters

484.639 --> 488.879
but it was interesting to see all the

486.96 --> 491.44
different angles to druids

488.879 --> 495.12
and even that they might be politicized

491.44 --> 498.479
there might be different factions and

495.12 --> 500.879
yeah that made sense but

498.479 --> 502.08
overall i don't know i didn't yeah sorry

500.879 --> 507.199
i didn't think it was worth

502.08 --> 510.8
watching through the two hours

507.199 --> 510.8
i don't know somebody else might have

511.84 --> 516.8
like robin stanley maybe she did watch

513.839 --> 516.8000000000001
entirely through it

518.839 --> 521.839
uh

524.8 --> 527.12
all right

529.519 --> 536.9590000000001
uh right just getting distracted here

533.279 --> 538.399
so yeah the flat earth debate show was

536.959 --> 543.04
about creation again

538.399 --> 543.04
and they made a few statements like

543.2 --> 547.839
we were talking about the creation story

545.6 --> 548.32
and i find that very interesting because

547.839 --> 551.44
yeah

548.32 --> 553.7600000000001
as robin stanley might know she's

551.44 --> 556.1600000000001
read through it or listen to it the

553.76 --> 560.3199999999999
audiobook because i even sent her that

556.16 --> 563.68
but i don't know take time whenever

560.32 --> 565.0400000000001
it is pretty much my interpretation of

563.68 --> 568.3199999999999
other factors

565.04 --> 568.8
like outside of that story like filling

568.32 --> 572.399
in

568.8 --> 576.7199999999999
what's in between sort of

572.399 --> 580.8
it was a very early attempt from

576.72 --> 580.8000000000001
2000 yeah from two years ago

583.44 --> 586.48
so we talked a lot about that discussed

586.16 --> 588.48
it

586.48 --> 590.08
and it became very apparent that yeah

588.48 --> 593.6
the daylight

590.08 --> 597.0400000000001
was first and that much

593.6 --> 600.08
later the luminaries

597.04 --> 601.4399999999999
including the sun and the moon as

600.08 --> 604.64
luminaries

601.44 --> 606.8800000000001
became or came into being so i thought

604.64 --> 609.12
that was very interesting in relation to

606.88 --> 609.12
my

609.36 --> 613.76
very convincing to me at least

611.44 --> 615.6800000000001
conception of the holographic nature of

613.76 --> 618.3199999999999
the heavenly bodies and that like

615.68 --> 619.04
the apparent discs including the moon

618.32 --> 621.9200000000001
and the sun

619.04 --> 623.68
are side effects of the light not the

621.92 --> 625.4399999999999
other way around

623.68 --> 626.8
light is not coming from those discs

625.44 --> 631.2
those discs are light

626.8 --> 633.92
holographic manifests because

631.2 --> 634.9590000000001
of the light like their holographic

633.92 --> 637.4399999999999
trademark

634.959 --> 638.16
and yeah creation story kind of backed

637.44 --> 640.399
that up

638.16 --> 642.64
and nathan was with me on that like he

640.399 --> 644.399
got it he got my argument was really

642.64 --> 647.92
fascinating

644.399 --> 651.2
and kiwi even like everybody

647.92 --> 653.519
tried to go against it and like nathan

651.2 --> 655.839
even went against qe now that's a rare

653.519 --> 655.839
thing

656.079 --> 660.56
so yeah a very interesting flat earth

658.64 --> 662.3199999999999
debate after show

660.56 --> 664.3199999999999
i don't know if you guys have seen it if

662.32 --> 666.0790000000001
i'm not sure if he streamed that

664.32 --> 668.8000000000001
or if it was the stream from the day

666.079 --> 670.959
before that was then in the evening

668.8 --> 672.8389999999999
anyway yeah oh and benjamin was on i was

670.959 --> 675.3599999999999
a bit late

672.839 --> 678.32
though again

675.36 --> 679.92
but not too late uh he had quote triple

678.32 --> 682.5600000000001
seven on

679.92 --> 684.959
really talking about yeah just he was

682.56 --> 690.079
really talking about the light and

684.959 --> 690.079
logos and just basically giving it his

690.399 --> 696.88
his vernacular explanation of

693.44 --> 699.9200000000001
yeah the the frequency

696.88 --> 700.88
and the essence the things that i talk

699.92 --> 703.4399999999999
about

700.88 --> 704.0
but from his vernacular from him his way

703.44 --> 707.6800000000001
of

704.0 --> 710.0
doing it and he's always really

707.68 --> 711.3599999999999
like working towards the positive that's

710.0 --> 716.399
like his focus

711.36 --> 719.92
in a way mark sergeant does that too

716.399 --> 723.2
i do it

719.92 --> 726.399
too but it's not like my prime focus and

723.2 --> 732.0
probably everybody realizes that

726.399 --> 735.519
because like yeah i do i keep doing that

732.0 --> 738.0
but i try to keep a balance you know

735.519 --> 740.32
because i just learned that the light

738.0 --> 742.48
contrasts better to the darkness but you

740.32 --> 744.639
got to be careful you don't if you

742.48 --> 746.24
take the darkness too far then the light

744.639 --> 748.9590000000001
actually

746.24 --> 752.16
becomes more remote and it's tougher to

748.959 --> 755.279
get it back and and etc etc

752.16 --> 757.519
yeah spiritual influences if you

755.279 --> 758.32
get too dark aromanian influences

757.519 --> 761.44
luciferian

758.32 --> 763.6800000000001
yeah you know the whole work so but

761.44 --> 763.6800000000001
it's

764.8 --> 769.12
right in order to understand it i have

767.76 --> 772.0
to still

769.12 --> 774.0
engage up to some level and i just have

772.0 --> 776.72
to be very careful

774.0 --> 778.32
because if you don't engage then you

776.72 --> 781.36
become ignorant

778.32 --> 783.2
of it and then you only learn by remote

781.36 --> 785.36
conceptions

783.2 --> 787.44
that's how you start to see things i

785.36 --> 789.04
want to understand it deeper i want to

787.44 --> 791.6
understand the mistakes i want to

789.04 --> 791.5999999999999
understand

793.04 --> 798.56
what people really makes them go

796.72 --> 800.0790000000001
and do that and how that work what that

798.56 --> 801.3599999999999
experience is and i have personal

800.079 --> 804.56
experiences from

801.36 --> 805.76
being sort of there or trying to get

804.56 --> 808.2399999999999
there halfway there

805.76 --> 808.88
until i realize what what it actually

808.24 --> 811.6800000000001
would

808.88 --> 813.36
turn out into it wouldn't end up in some

811.68 --> 813.76
great position or it would end up in

813.36 --> 817.04
just

813.76 --> 822.56
absolute ruin

817.04 --> 822.56
ruins and then i kind of like

822.72 --> 829.12
broke with it worked my way out

825.76 --> 832.079
and just yeah became what i

829.12 --> 832.079
pretty much became

832.48 --> 839.04
20 years ago pretty isolated

835.76 --> 840.0
because yeah this was going on they were

839.04 --> 842.88
seeming to grab

840.0 --> 844.16
power they were very dominating and

842.88 --> 847.279
getting in everybody's

844.16 --> 848.88
business and faces and [ __ ] and it just

847.279 --> 851.36
didn't seem like i could

848.88 --> 853.36
really build up something big in that in

851.36 --> 855.44
that condition from the angles that were

853.36 --> 858.48
available to me then

855.44 --> 860.5600000000001
so yeah that happened anyway oh thanks

858.48 --> 864.0

898.72 --> 913.839
yeah that's it

914.32 --> 921.12
yeah yeah sleeping warrior yeah the guy

917.36 --> 925.1990000000001
is a that guy the ancient aliens guy

921.12 --> 927.199
everybody now knows him but he's like a

925.199 --> 929.8389999999999
he's a full-time professional wizard

927.199 --> 932.959
like he has a company and

929.839 --> 938.399
like that guy really made works

932.959 --> 938.399
of his beliefs when you read into it

938.839 --> 943.36
uh yep full-time wizard

952.079 --> 956.3199999999999
right anyway yeah um benjamin was pretty

954.72 --> 959.36
awesome

956.32 --> 961.12
and then after crow left he also went

959.36 --> 963.6800000000001
went on a rant and it was freaking

961.12 --> 966.48
hilarious against catholicism again

963.68 --> 968.56
and against priests yeah he had a really

966.48 --> 971.04
he has a such a dirty mind sometimes but

968.56 --> 975.4399999999999
it's just freaking hilarious

971.04 --> 979.279
basically about confessionals and the

975.44 --> 982.72
priests then behind their window

979.279 --> 985.4399999999999
start to ask like oh did he

982.72 --> 986.24
like did he did he or she do this to you

985.44 --> 989.759
and that like

986.24 --> 991.92
very sexually details and yeah that it

989.759 --> 993.519
is extremely suspicious like why would

991.92 --> 995.519
they know and that yeah

993.519 --> 998.079
he basically played into the squirt

995.519 --> 1000.16
fantasies and all that and

998.079 --> 1002.16
and who knows you know maybe that some

1000.16 --> 1004.639
of that actually does happen

1002.16 --> 1006.88
and it was it was amazing and then just

1004.639 --> 1009.36
with his

1006.88 --> 1011.279
yeah like he explained yeah i used to be

1009.36 --> 1015.1990000000001
an altar boy and then i realized

1011.279 --> 1018.16
wait candles i have to wear a dress

1015.199 --> 1020.88
and i have to drink wine hmm that sounds

1018.16 --> 1020.88
like a date

1021.44 --> 1028.799
i thought that was just wow yeah

1026.4 --> 1030.0790000000002
if you're wearing a dress there's

1028.799 --> 1032.959
candles

1030.079 --> 1035.05
and you're drinking wine you're probably

1032.959 --> 1036.799
on a date

1035.05 --> 1038.72
[Music]

1036.799 --> 1039.9189999999999
now personally i have never been an

1038.72 --> 1042.079
altar boy

1039.919 --> 1042.0790000000002
but

1047.28 --> 1053.9189999999999
well you know that like catholics

1050.88 --> 1056.0800000000002
and pedo jokes and that they technically

1053.919 --> 1057.8400000000001
have been going around like since i was

1056.08 --> 1061.28
very young

1057.84 --> 1062.3999999999999
so i'm well familiar with that then i

1061.28 --> 1064.84
realized oh wait

1062.4 --> 1067.52
they're doing it to actually shame

1064.84 --> 1071.28
christianity maybe it's not

1067.52 --> 1072.48
that funny and then later i realized oh

1071.28 --> 1076.32
[ __ ]

1072.48 --> 1080.0
the pope and all that like what is this

1076.32 --> 1082.48
what is catholicism like this is surreal

1080.0 --> 1083.039
and yeah but that happened pretty late

1082.48 --> 1085.6
on as

1083.039 --> 1086.24
let's just say a couple of years ago

1085.6 --> 1088.9599999999998
figure that

1086.24 --> 1088.96
last part out

1091.039 --> 1097.28
punchline was dark yeah yeah it was

1094.559 --> 1097.84
anyway i finished up the evening

1097.28 --> 1100.799
watching

1097.84 --> 1102.24
dungeons and dragons 2 which i have good

1100.799 --> 1104.32
memories of

1102.24 --> 1105.6
from the yeah from the time that it came

1104.32 --> 1107.84
out

1105.6 --> 1110.1599999999999
and then yeah i watched it back and i

1107.84 --> 1113.6789999999999
realized oh [ __ ]

1110.16 --> 1117.039
it really isn't that good like the story

1113.679 --> 1119.52
is it's like

1117.039 --> 1122.96
yeah that's that's a pretty standard

1119.52 --> 1125.9189999999999
dungeons and dragons adventure

1122.96 --> 1127.1200000000001
but like it's rushed and it just feels

1125.919 --> 1128.96
rushed

1127.12 --> 1130.3999999999999
and yeah and the only thing that really

1128.96 --> 1133.44
makes things right for me

1130.4 --> 1136.799
in the movie is just the main villain

1133.44 --> 1140.3200000000002
because he is so into the role and so

1136.799 --> 1143.36
expressive that it's just like

1140.32 --> 1146.3999999999999
huh but

1143.36 --> 1149.4399999999998
yeah it was a b movie well you know the

1146.4 --> 1153.44
first one was absolutely horrific

1149.44 --> 1156.0
it was terrible terrible

1153.44 --> 1156.72
like every freaking person in the world

1156.0 --> 1158.88
hated it

1156.72 --> 1160.799
except maybe little very little kids

1158.88 --> 1163.2
because they're all dragons dragons

1160.799 --> 1165.12
that's like the only person people in

1163.2 --> 1168.4
there that might have liked it

1165.12 --> 1170.2399999999998
because it was stupid it was d and d it

1168.4 --> 1171.2
was absolutely [ __ ] they had a

1170.24 --> 1175.1200000000001
character in there

1171.2 --> 1178.24
just who was like totally

1175.12 --> 1179.52
out of place like yet that didn't make

1178.24 --> 1183.36
any sense

1179.52 --> 1187.28
cultural wise and like street [ __ ] in

1183.36 --> 1187.28
in that is no just no

1187.76 --> 1191.76
and i think a lot of people agreed to me

1189.36 --> 1194.559
and it was over the top and silly and

1191.76 --> 1196.32
the second movie is is slightly more

1194.559 --> 1199.6
believable but

1196.32 --> 1203.039
it's still not

1199.6 --> 1205.1999999999998
very compelling it's like a very very

1203.039 --> 1207.679
very soft lord of the rings

1205.2 --> 1210.0800000000002
kind of thing with much more magic

1207.679 --> 1213.2800000000002
situations it is really also just like

1210.08 --> 1215.36
magic centric and hey d kind of is

1213.28 --> 1216.6399999999999
magic centric there's so much magic and

1215.36 --> 1220.24
it has so much

1216.64 --> 1220.88
sway it is very used for plot devices

1220.24 --> 1224.72
and

1220.88 --> 1225.8400000000001
all that and that's in this movie too

1224.72 --> 1228.559
and there were just a couple of

1225.84 --> 1230.8799999999999
characters that were pretty awesome

1228.559 --> 1231.6789999999999
i thought the rogue was just really cool

1230.88 --> 1235.3600000000001
and i think

1231.679 --> 1239.039
he did a really interesting rogue

1235.36 --> 1240.6399999999999
i just like the guy very sneakiness and

1239.039 --> 1242.8799999999999
very

1240.64 --> 1243.8400000000001
like he was a charismatic rogue i liked

1242.88 --> 1245.1200000000001
it he's

1243.84 --> 1247.039
that character has been a great

1245.12 --> 1250.6399999999999
inspiration yeah

1247.039 --> 1252.799
for my own development in my dnd book

1250.64 --> 1254.5590000000002
because yeah i thought it was well done

1252.799 --> 1258.1589999999999
and

1254.559 --> 1262.0
yeah and so were the villain or villains

1258.159 --> 1265.44
because i thought the lich was also yeah

1262.0 --> 1267.76
like it was convincing maybe

1265.44 --> 1268.48
like the mask and all that was maybe a

1267.76 --> 1271.28
bit

1268.48 --> 1273.3600000000001
goofy looking to some it's like it's not

1271.28 --> 1276.48
super high-tech cgi

1273.36 --> 1277.84
or mask qualities of like big budget

1276.48 --> 1281.6
films you know

1277.84 --> 1284.24
but it was done good enough so

1281.6 --> 1285.36
that was the second movie and yeah i

1284.24 --> 1287.52
watched it back

1285.36 --> 1288.3999999999999
it wasn't as good as i remembered it but

1287.52 --> 1291.84
still yeah the

1288.4 --> 1291.8400000000001
the good parts were good

1292.159 --> 1298.88
and yeah oh [ __ ] man some of the cgi was

1295.28 --> 1300.799
really dated really dated

1298.88 --> 1302.0
but it's not their fault it's yeah

1300.799 --> 1306.0
that's just logical

1302.0 --> 1310.72
it was a pretty early movie

1306.0 --> 1319.84
again like 2008 something like that

1310.72 --> 1319.84
let me double check that

1322.64 --> 1328.3200000000002
no 2005 well there you go so yeah

1328.96 --> 1332.48
now of course lord of the rings was

1331.36 --> 1335.76
first

1332.48 --> 1338.72
i think and it's

1335.76 --> 1340.32
it's very apparent that that has an

1338.72 --> 1342.559
influence on it like they

1340.32 --> 1343.6789999999999
as i said it's like a soft lord of the

1342.559 --> 1347.84
rings but it's just

1343.679 --> 1350.3200000000002
not a very well thought out story

1347.84 --> 1352.32
although for a d and d campaign it's

1350.32 --> 1356.72
pretty it's decent enough you know

1352.32 --> 1359.4399999999998
that's the way it is anyway

1356.72 --> 1360.559
uh yeah watch that and then after that

1359.44 --> 1364.64
uh

1360.559 --> 1364.6399999999999
yeah i'm just basic gaming and

1364.72 --> 1368.0
that's it went to bed

1372.4 --> 1376.72
all right so yeah you guys have been

1374.24 --> 1376.72
talking

1381.28 --> 1388.08
okay um yeah seven says

1384.64 --> 1392.64
my friend said thanks i win okay

1388.08 --> 1392.6399999999999
i don't know thanks for what

1400.96 --> 1405.679
the masonics use special zoom filters

1404.32 --> 1409.12
that make the moon look

1405.679 --> 1417.8400000000001
real through telus what

1409.12 --> 1417.84
i don't know

1428.4 --> 1431.8400000000001
talking about the moon

1436.32 --> 1445.6
now the moon doesn't look like a ball to

1438.0 --> 1448.72
me at all

1445.6 --> 1451.84
this yeah it's only the light play that

1448.72 --> 1451.84
kind of suggests it

1453.36 --> 1456.24
but yeah

1456.48 --> 1459.919
just the way it is shaped is not

1458.159 --> 1461.0390000000002
consistent with the ball it's like more

1459.919 --> 1464.7990000000002
like a pancake

1461.039 --> 1468.32
or a pie or whatever you want to think

1464.799 --> 1471.9189999999999
yeah it looks like a flat disc to me

1468.32 --> 1487.84
when i zoom in with my p900 and all that

1471.919 --> 1487.8400000000001
you've seen the videos

1507.279 --> 1512.84
if i looked through to looked at the

1510.32 --> 1515.84
moon through a telescope yeah

1512.84 --> 1515.84
yes

1526.84 --> 1533.6789999999999
no no there is

1529.52 --> 1537.9189999999999
look spherical means 3d there is no

1533.679 --> 1537.919
it's 2d you're looking at the 2d

1540.84 --> 1543.84
light

1543.919 --> 1549.3600000000001
probably if anything it is minutely

1547.679 --> 1552.24
concave

1549.36 --> 1553.52
which would be logical since yeah if it

1552.24 --> 1556.559
is what i think it is

1553.52 --> 1559.52
it's going to be a light projection

1556.559 --> 1561.6
at the edge of your vision which yeah

1559.52 --> 1563.44
your edge of vision is basically a

1561.6 --> 1566.6399999999999
sphere around you so if it is

1563.44 --> 1569.6000000000001
on that sphere then

1566.64 --> 1572.159
technically it would be geometrically

1569.6 --> 1575.4399999999998
slightly concave

1572.159 --> 1575.44
slightly concave disc

1575.919 --> 1579.2
but it's all apparition so light there's

1578.88 --> 1585.8400000000001
no

1579.2 --> 1585.8400000000001
no physical thing there anyway

1591.2 --> 1599.47
what's going on

1598.0 --> 1602.69
all right

1599.47 --> 1602.69
[Music]

1604.559 --> 1608.08
yes that's right looking at 2d light

1606.799 --> 1610.96
with both eyes because

1608.08 --> 1610.96
both eyes

1611.52 --> 1620.24
both your eyes are pretty much spherical

1615.44 --> 1620.24
or well lens based

1620.4 --> 1627.679
and yeah i think that

1623.84 --> 1630.48
the apparitions the celestial

1627.679 --> 1632.3200000000002
globe of the heavens all those lights

1630.48 --> 1636.72
are

1632.32 --> 1640.1589999999999
lens and eye specific phenomena they are

1636.72 --> 1643.6000000000001
natural consequence of having

1640.159 --> 1645.44
light physical light receptacles

1643.6 --> 1647.12
and that it's a side effect of that i

1645.44 --> 1649.52
even tried to argue that on the flat

1647.12 --> 1653.36
earth debate after show

1649.52 --> 1654.799
because yeah uh first the daylight is

1653.36 --> 1657.84
there

1654.799 --> 1660.559
then god puts the celestials

1657.84 --> 1661.6789999999999
yeah the celestials in the sky and the

1660.559 --> 1666.48
sun and the moon

1661.679 --> 1666.48
afterward in yeah did that

1666.84 --> 1673.039
and

1669.52 --> 1676.0
yeah then after that he creates

1673.039 --> 1678.799
the sea creatures who have eyes who they

1676.0 --> 1682.399
are the first to have eyes to be created

1678.799 --> 1684.24
so how i interpreted that

1682.399 --> 1687.039
basically looking on the maneuvering

1684.24 --> 1690.559
room with the statements made okay

1687.039 --> 1693.679
so he designed the eye

1690.559 --> 1697.039
because god does not need eyes to see

1693.679 --> 1698.96
he is all things he designed and i it's

1697.039 --> 1701.84
just not really literally said

1698.96 --> 1703.2
and then because of that suddenly the

1701.84 --> 1705.6
celestial

1703.2 --> 1706.799
things come into being because the light

1705.6 --> 1709.52
is there

1706.799 --> 1712.0
but only because of eyes this is what i

1709.52 --> 1715.52
am assuming right now with my concept

1712.0 --> 1718.32
only because of eyes are the celestial

1715.52 --> 1719.9189999999999
things seen so they're only visible to

1718.32 --> 1723.6789999999999
the

1719.919 --> 1725.6000000000001
earth bound do you see only the things

1723.679 --> 1727.1200000000001
on earth can see it this even explains

1725.6 --> 1730.24
the dark world

1727.12 --> 1733.1999999999998
to me or why i didn't see any of that

1730.24 --> 1734.24
because i was a spirit didn't have

1733.2 --> 1737.279
physical eyes

1734.24 --> 1741.44
to look through right

1737.279 --> 1744.72
so god designed the eyes the celestial

1741.44 --> 1747.1200000000001
things manifest he realizes it

1744.72 --> 1748.32
it is the natural consequent and then he

1747.12 --> 1752.2399999999998
puts his design

1748.32 --> 1754.799
into a living being

1752.24 --> 1758.3990000000001
the creatures of the sea first and then

1754.799 --> 1761.6
animals and eventually human beings

1758.399 --> 1765.039
but yeah before the eyes were designed

1761.6 --> 1767.76
the celestial things were simply not

1765.039 --> 1768.72
there yet there was life there was

1767.76 --> 1773.279
plants

1768.72 --> 1776.559
growing on the energy of the daylight

1773.279 --> 1780.159
yeah no celestial bodies there no sun

1776.559 --> 1783.36
to produce the daylight they were there

1780.159 --> 1786.48
see i got a case i

1783.36 --> 1786.4799999999998
actually got a case

1790.32 --> 1795.6
my conception actually matches the

1792.399 --> 1798.8799999999999
creation story

1795.6 --> 1799.84
i i felt it coming but i never saw the

1798.88 --> 1803.3600000000001
connection

1799.84 --> 1803.36
pretty much until yesterday

1805.12 --> 1808.1589999999999
oh maybe i did see the connection

1806.799 --> 1811.679
earlier but yeah just

1808.159 --> 1813.279
glanced past it i probably might have

1811.679 --> 1814.96
mentioned something like that but i

1813.279 --> 1816.559
would have barely understood it myself

1814.96 --> 1818.48
and other people probably would have

1816.559 --> 1820.48
glanced past it

1818.48 --> 1822.3990000000001
because it does happen i do see things

1820.48 --> 1825.76
coming very early and then there's no

1822.399 --> 1825.76
grounds to put it into

1828.799 --> 1851.84
what's this

1836.799 --> 1851.84
and it says spam nonsense

1882.399 --> 1888.1589999999999
so anybody else got a comment

1886.0 --> 1893.84
i don't know i do get trolls more

1888.159 --> 1893.8400000000001
regularly these days

1904.84 --> 1921.84
so

1907.519 --> 1921.84
perfect circled pairs what

1932.84 --> 1935.84
hey

1939.84 --> 1945.1999999999998
when you're dead you're dead what i

1942.96 --> 1949.8400000000001
wasn't talking about dead

1945.2 --> 1949.8400000000001
talking about

1951.76 --> 1963.84
basically yeah astral projection or

1955.679 --> 1963.8400000000001
just extra bodily spiritual activities

1974.84 --> 1980.559
okay

1977.519 --> 1982.799
is what i what or

1980.559 --> 1991.84
what are you gonna present me with a

1982.799 --> 1991.84
false dichotomy now

2006.48 --> 2019.84
all right roger don't worry about it

2022.0 --> 2026.399
how do you go to heaven well

2028.72 --> 2032.08
you get out of your body and then you

2031.039 --> 2035.279
don't come back

2032.08 --> 2038.24
and then you move beyond

2035.279 --> 2038.24
further through

2040.159 --> 2044.0800000000002
that could be in yeah all kinds of

2043.039 --> 2048.96
directions

2044.08 --> 2052.21
and you yeah you might hang around

2048.96 --> 2053.679
and then yeah i don't know

2052.21 --> 2057.119
[Music]

2053.679 --> 2059.919
you know i've never experienced like the

2057.119 --> 2062.2400000000002
literal heaven but i don't think it's

2059.919 --> 2065.04
possible to go there

2062.24 --> 2068.4799999999996
when you're still alive like unless

2065.04 --> 2075.839
you've been very specifically designated

2068.48 --> 2075.839
by the creator to do something

2081.599 --> 2085.52
but i don't know my experiences have

2083.679 --> 2088.8
been extremely elaborate

2085.52 --> 2091.7599999999998
and like extremely elaborate

2088.8 --> 2095.52
and for me sometimes it's been quite

2091.76 --> 2095.5200000000004
hard to distinguish what have been

2095.919 --> 2102.7999999999997
actual spiritual

2099.44 --> 2105.92
natural experiences where it wasn't

2102.8 --> 2106.8
a creation a recreation of things that

2105.92 --> 2109.6800000000003
i've seen

2106.8 --> 2111.2000000000003
in my life rearranged in some kind of

2109.68 --> 2114.839
holographic manner to

2111.2 --> 2117.839
try and convince me of some kind of

2114.839 --> 2120.0
situation

2117.839 --> 2121.359
because i have a lot of memories of that

2120.0 --> 2123.92
and that i can even

2121.359 --> 2125.7599999999998
as time progresses reflect back on

2123.92 --> 2131.2000000000003
things that i'm seeing as i'm just

2125.76 --> 2132.5600000000004
living the 3d life normal time based

2131.2 --> 2134.56
so it's it's kind of tough to

2132.56 --> 2137.839
distinguish

2134.56 --> 2139.359
it all because certainly heavenly sights

2137.839 --> 2147.119
and suggestions have

2139.359 --> 2147.119
been there and come just very high-end

2147.68 --> 2151.7599999999998
insights and i don't know

2152.56 --> 2156.0
it's yeah it's just that if you go to

2155.52 --> 2159.359
heaven

2156.0 --> 2161.599
you there's no point having a memory of

2159.359 --> 2161.5989999999997
that

2164.96 --> 2168.2400000000002
it's gonna give iri man full grip if you

2167.44 --> 2170.16
do that

2168.24 --> 2171.7599999999998
i think i don't know it's it's so

2170.16 --> 2175.73
complicated man

2171.76 --> 2177.76
but i'm not denying that there is heaven

2175.73 --> 2182.88
[Music]

2177.76 --> 2182.88
and yeah i really hope to go there

2183.359 --> 2188.64
if if if yeah if that's allowed

2186.56 --> 2190.88
i don't know after everything i've been

2188.64 --> 2190.8799999999997
through

2192.88 --> 2195.92
you know sometimes i wonder if any of us

2194.56 --> 2199.359
are really allowed

2195.92 --> 2201.04
and if we would technically not be what

2199.359 --> 2204.3199999999997
would that mean what would god

2201.04 --> 2208.72
do with the whole situation

2204.32 --> 2208.7200000000003
and maybe that is kind of what's going

2212.839 --> 2218.72
on

2215.599 --> 2220.2400000000002
who is iron man everyone is it comes

2218.72 --> 2223.359
from

2220.24 --> 2225.359
a terminology within the ronald steiner

2223.359 --> 2228.24
spiritual

2225.359 --> 2231.68
christianity is where ariman is

2228.24 --> 2236.3999999999996
basically the personification of death

2231.68 --> 2240.3999999999996
it's yeah you have lucifer the seducer

2236.4 --> 2242.7200000000003
and the trickster and the arrogant one

2240.4 --> 2243.44
and you have ariman who's the depressor

2242.72 --> 2247.9199999999996
the the

2243.44 --> 2247.92
the yeah death the destroyer

2249.52 --> 2252.0
the end

2254.16 --> 2261.2799999999997
so yeah there's a distinguishment there

2258.48 --> 2261.68
and then yeah i don't it i don't it's

2261.28 --> 2264.5600000000004
not

2261.68 --> 2264.56
called satan

2268.32 --> 2271.839
it's divided up in various in

2270.72 --> 2273.9199999999996
frequencies and

2271.839 --> 2275.7599999999998
like specific type of energies and

2273.92 --> 2279.76
elements that you can

2275.76 --> 2280.2400000000002
recognize and compartmentalize in order

2279.76 --> 2285.0400000000004
to

2280.24 --> 2288.3199999999997
deal with it all a lot better

2285.04 --> 2288.32
when you're confronted with it

2289.599 --> 2299.839
yay a good servant that's nice

2292.72 --> 2299.839
i know

2360.31 --> 2363.5299999999997
[Music]

2375.28 --> 2378.4
no peter's done

2378.48 --> 2384.4
that's that's weird like like to remind

2382.0 --> 2386.64
people that even in the old world

2384.4 --> 2388.48
resurrection was not as common as it

2386.64 --> 2390.16
tends to be in dungeons and dragons

2388.48 --> 2394.839
universe right

2390.16 --> 2397.839
and he was not resurrected he

2394.839 --> 2397.839
resurrected

2398.0 --> 2404.4
nobody did that to him he was not

2401.599 --> 2404.4
resurrect he

2408.839 --> 2411.839
resurrected

2415.2 --> 2423.2
and i've seen some like attempts

2418.8 --> 2424.96
in a movie world to kind of bypass that

2423.2 --> 2428.3999999999996
and suggest that he was

2424.96 --> 2439.839
resurrected by secrets

2428.4 --> 2439.839
so very nice

2450.72 --> 2454.7999999999997
yeah you don't get it peterstone you

2453.119 --> 2458.0
just don't get it

2454.8 --> 2463.119
it's not trying to save us

2458.0 --> 2467.119
from himself he was there

2463.119 --> 2471.6800000000003
to help us all out there's basically

2467.119 --> 2474.48
a second phase the alteration

2471.68 --> 2476.7999999999997
of the plan which was always going to

2474.48 --> 2476.8
happen

2477.28 --> 2483.6800000000003
it was the turning point that's

2480.48 --> 2487.44
what he did it's not

2483.68 --> 2487.44
saving the world from god

2488.24 --> 2495.839
it's altering the the yeah the rules of

2491.68 --> 2495.839
the design that's what that is

2495.92 --> 2500.2400000000002
makes it worse in your opinion well

2498.64 --> 2503.7599999999998
thank you for your

2500.24 --> 2506.24
opinion in how to design creation thank

2503.76 --> 2510.96
you very much peter stone

2506.24 --> 2510.9599999999996
i'm sure god greatly appreciates your

2520.839 --> 2523.839
input

2562.8 --> 2565.8390000000004
dude don't do that

2592.96 --> 2598.2400000000002
yeah peter stone yes you do

2596.079 --> 2599.2000000000003
you do need saving you need saving from

2598.24 --> 2603.2799999999997
yourself

2599.2 --> 2604.839
you need saving from the totality of the

2603.28 --> 2608.7200000000003
challenges that god

2604.839 --> 2611.68
thought everyone his creation

2608.72 --> 2613.5989999999997
would be able to do he had great hopes

2611.68 --> 2616.96
for his offspring

2613.599 --> 2621.839
for his master creation he thought

2616.96 --> 2621.839
we could all handle it he however

2622.56 --> 2629.68
needed an alteration because of entropy

2626.24 --> 2633.04
even the entropy of the spirit of the

2629.68 --> 2634.3999999999996
the continuing developing spirit of

2633.04 --> 2636.96
mankind

2634.4 --> 2638.56
and the and the failed challenges that

2636.96 --> 2641.44
basically the division

2638.56 --> 2642.7999999999997
the the this the springing up darkness

2641.44 --> 2644.88
as well

2642.8 --> 2647.119
yeah that just naturally arrives it's a

2644.88 --> 2651.119
natural con it's a design consequence

2647.119 --> 2654.6400000000003
and he had to alter it because entropy

2651.119 --> 2656.6400000000003
the reason jesus christ came it could be

2654.64 --> 2660.0
considered spiritual entropy

2656.64 --> 2663.44
like if that if he hadn't come

2660.0 --> 2667.359
then yeah it would have all ended

2663.44 --> 2671.28
it would have just been a savage

2667.359 --> 2671.2799999999997
wasteland everywhere now

2671.44 --> 2679.28
so what's the point in that

2675.68 --> 2681.7599999999998
it it doesn't bring the

2679.28 --> 2683.92
the master design of human humanity to

2681.76 --> 2687.28
its fruition that way

2683.92 --> 2690.88
so it had to give them a big

2687.28 --> 2694.96
notch in the spiritual realm to

2690.88 --> 2698.8
counter counteract the natural growing

2694.96 --> 2698.8
darkness that comes from the entropy

2701.28 --> 2705.8390000000004
had to push back

2715.839 --> 2733.839
yeah maybe this is all going way over

2718.88 --> 2733.839
your head you don't get it

2735.68 --> 2740.96
why would an all-knowing being have

2738.56 --> 2740.96
hopes

2743.119 --> 2747.839
what are you talking about

2754.319 --> 2760.96
he's not certain of the future really

2758.079 --> 2762.88
is that what that is no no no it's not

2760.96 --> 2764.7200000000003
hope about the end he knows

2762.88 --> 2766.079
what's going to happen it's hope for the

2764.72 --> 2768.3999999999996
individuals

2766.079 --> 2769.44
hope for whatever

2768.4 --> 2772.7200000000003
[Music]

2769.44 --> 2775.839
character ability

2772.72 --> 2777.4399999999996
transits to his frequency side in the

2775.839 --> 2778.24
spectrum of the spiritual realm

2777.44 --> 2780.2400000000002
basically

2778.24 --> 2782.7999999999997
that's what he has hopes for he has

2780.24 --> 2785.04
hopes for the little things

2782.8 --> 2787.52
you could call the hope it lies in the

2785.04 --> 2792.079
region of sentimentality

2787.52 --> 2795.68
it's not hope against

2792.079 --> 2803.8390000000004
some doom no he knows he designed it he

2795.68 --> 2803.839
knows where it's going to lead

2807.119 --> 2810.48
yeah you don't know that agent

2811.52 --> 2830.16
that's just a blank assertion you don't

2814.4 --> 2833.52
know if he even was the only one

2830.16 --> 2835.04
even in by yeah what am i saying even in

2833.52 --> 2839.2
the bible

2835.04 --> 2839.2
he's not the only one so it's just wrong

2840.559 --> 2845.76
agm it's just wrong even in the bible

2843.04 --> 2849.2799999999997
itself jesus is not the only one that is

2845.76 --> 2849.28
resurrected so it's just wrong

2856.839 --> 2859.839
sorry

2884.88 --> 2887.839
oh

2895.28 --> 2900.4
am i not understanding something yes

2897.52 --> 2903.7599999999998
nicholas riddle absolutely

2900.4 --> 2907.28
you're not understanding [ __ ]

2903.76 --> 2907.28
you totally don't get it

2908.0 --> 2917.2
you're right

2915.44 --> 2919.68
you don't even understand what any of

2917.2 --> 2919.68
that is

2920.96 --> 2928.4
you have no oversight in design

2925.839 --> 2930.72
and what it means to be human and what

2928.4 --> 2933.599
we need and what we want

2930.72 --> 2934.24
and that it may be very different than

2933.599 --> 2936.4
you would

2934.24 --> 2939.2799999999997
assume if you're typically stuck like

2936.4 --> 2941.44
most people in a very specific mindset

2939.28 --> 2943.6800000000003
in ways you experience feeling things

2941.44 --> 2957.839
yeah so you're wrong

2943.68 --> 2957.839
that's right

2966.079 --> 2969.44
the religious yeah well i am not the

2968.64 --> 2972.7999999999997
religious

2969.44 --> 2977.359
and i am not a churchian

2972.8 --> 2977.3590000000004
i do not follow the words of others

2977.68 --> 2984.0
i do my own study

2981.92 --> 2985.44
i do it in a different way than most

2984.0 --> 2987.52
people do and

2985.44 --> 2991.04
i'm an as a terrorist i'm an eclectic

2987.52 --> 2993.2
christian as a terrorist

2991.04 --> 2994.319
and yeah you're not going to compare me

2993.2 --> 2996.8799999999997
to

2994.319 --> 2999.839
bible bashing people and all that thank

2996.88 --> 2999.839
you very much

3008.88 --> 3016.4
well nicholas riddle he doesn't

3013.119 --> 3019.599
did christ say that or

3016.4 --> 3022.2400000000002
did other people say that you know

3019.599 --> 3024.4
it's so funny that people that are

3022.24 --> 3026.0
atheists because they're so used to this

3024.4 --> 3029.359
[ __ ] body of science

3026.0 --> 3031.2
[ __ ] consensus that just over time

3029.359 --> 3033.2799999999997
people made [ __ ] up and then it's

3031.2 --> 3033.9199999999996
absorbed as if it's like an original

3033.28 --> 3037.119
truth

3033.92 --> 3039.359
and then they think like it works that

3037.119 --> 3042.0
way with christianity because some

3039.359 --> 3042.5589999999997
people i don't know 100 years ago or

3042.0 --> 3044.64
whatever

3042.559 --> 3046.559
came up with a certain approach

3044.64 --> 3047.7599999999998
philosophically and suddenly everybody

3046.559 --> 3050.0
adopted that and that's

3047.76 --> 3051.44
the normality now that that means that

3050.0 --> 3055.119
it is of christ

3051.44 --> 3059.359
well guess what you're wrong you're

3055.119 --> 3063.28
wrong stop projecting

3059.359 --> 3069.839
your consensus [ __ ] thinking

3063.28 --> 3069.8390000000004
onto christianity thank you very much

3072.72 --> 3076.319
yeah yeah that's right peter stone he

3074.88 --> 3081.28
said that and guess what

3076.319 --> 3084.96
he's right yeah he's right

3081.28 --> 3088.079
it's the way it is it's the freaking

3084.96 --> 3097.68
way it is you don't like it well

3088.079 --> 3101.04
go to hell

3097.68 --> 3104.3999999999996
no no people condemn themselves

3101.04 --> 3106.24
to the eternal fire you know

3104.4 --> 3108.1600000000003
when there's a design there's going to

3106.24 --> 3111.1189999999997
be rules

3108.16 --> 3111.68
if you don't like the rules well then go

3111.119 --> 3115.44
to

3111.68 --> 3124.96
hell peter stone

3115.44 --> 3128.0
yeah i'm not the one that made the rules

3124.96 --> 3130.319
yeah that's right

3128.0 --> 3131.359
you can think about it somewhere else

3130.319 --> 3134.16
because you're

3131.359 --> 3138.64
a very annoying disgusting person and i

3134.16 --> 3142.0
don't want to have you in here again

3138.64 --> 3144.48
and i made enough points yeah nicholas

3142.0 --> 3148.319
riddle if you want to follow step

3144.48 --> 3148.319
then continue why don't you

3150.559 --> 3156.559
why why that's why that's why

3153.68 --> 3158.72
that's why it works that way it's the

3156.559 --> 3163.119
rules if you can't handle it then go

3158.72 --> 3166.48
to hell you too nicholas riddle

3163.119 --> 3168.0
if you don't like that the things work

3166.48 --> 3171.359
the way they work

3168.0 --> 3174.319
then go to hell

3171.359 --> 3174.319
that's how it works

3175.76 --> 3183.2000000000003
it's not a man-to-man suggestion

3179.28 --> 3183.2000000000003
it's a natural consequence

3190.24 --> 3209.2799999999997
yeah you can get the [ __ ] out

3193.52 --> 3211.599
too anymore

3209.28 --> 3212.3190000000004
again i think that the most people in

3211.599 --> 3215.2000000000003
here get it

3212.319 --> 3217.04
when i say if you don't like the rules

3215.2 --> 3220.5589999999997
then you can go to hell

3217.04 --> 3223.92
that's not me saying these are

3220.559 --> 3226.96
my rules if you don't follow my

3223.92 --> 3228.64
rules you're going to hell no no that's

3226.96 --> 3231.28
not what i'm saying now what i'm saying

3228.64 --> 3232.16
is just the baseline this is how it

3231.28 --> 3234.6400000000003
works

3232.16 --> 3235.44
when you don't follow the rules you go

3234.64 --> 3238.64
to hell

3235.44 --> 3242.079
that's not me dictating to you

3238.64 --> 3242.8799999999997
it is reality it's how it works it's the

3242.079 --> 3245.6800000000003
mechanism

3242.88 --> 3246.7200000000003
that is part of being human part of the

3245.68 --> 3249.2
spiritual realm

3246.72 --> 3250.9599999999996
it is how this world works and if you

3249.2 --> 3254.0
don't like it

3250.96 --> 3258.319
you deal with you not liking it

3254.0 --> 3261.28
because if you think that you can impose

3258.319 --> 3262.4
your dissatisfaction and your will on

3261.28 --> 3265.8390000000004
creation

3262.4 --> 3268.0
to pretend to change it or to bypass

3265.839 --> 3269.44
it guess what's going to happen you're

3268.0 --> 3271.92
breaking the rules

3269.44 --> 3274.16
you know what's happening then you go to

3271.92 --> 3274.16
hell

3275.839 --> 3280.0789999999997
and what that means leave it up for the

3279.2 --> 3283.52
frequency

3280.079 --> 3285.92
frequency of just saying hell is plenty

3283.52 --> 3287.92
you know what it actually means is very

3285.92 --> 3291.119
complex it's for the spirit

3287.92 --> 3293.44
it's for the spirit itself

3291.119 --> 3294.6400000000003
but the frequency is a consequence

3293.44 --> 3297.44
definitely

3294.64 --> 3300.319
things happen when you break the rules

3297.44 --> 3306.4700000000003
those things are not good

3300.319 --> 3309.63
you go to hell

3306.47 --> 3309.6299999999997
[Music]

3324.88 --> 3329.92
yeah now omnipotent means you don't have

3328.0 --> 3334.079
unlimited power it means you have

3329.92 --> 3337.44
all the power there is

3334.079 --> 3340.559
but hey god's

3337.44 --> 3343.2000000000003
realm is earth it's like

3340.559 --> 3344.7200000000003
this is what he made this is where he

3343.2 --> 3348.64
integrated his energy

3344.72 --> 3351.52
this is him it's his

3348.64 --> 3353.52
but there is a darkness out there in the

3351.52 --> 3355.52
deep remember before the light shone on

3353.52 --> 3358.64
it

3355.52 --> 3361.7599999999998
yeah if you wanna get

3358.64 --> 3377.839
out of god's reach

3361.76 --> 3377.8390000000004
yeah guess what's going to be there

3380.64 --> 3388.799
yeah nobody in the universe

3385.52 --> 3392.72
however big you think that is is

3388.799 --> 3396.24
condemned to an eternity of hell

3392.72 --> 3399.2799999999997
without them making that choice

3396.24 --> 3405.68
you can't go to hell unless

3399.28 --> 3407.52
you choose it

3405.68 --> 3408.72
actually turns out to be a lot tougher

3407.52 --> 3412.0
than one would

3408.72 --> 3413.359
expect but that doesn't mean you can't

3412.0 --> 3416.4
touch upon hell

3413.359 --> 3416.4
even within life

3417.119 --> 3421.6800000000003
you know you keep stuck on that final

3420.319 --> 3423.2
supposed realm

3421.68 --> 3425.04
nicholas riddle that's the only thing

3423.2 --> 3428.0789999999997
you're [ __ ] talking about here

3425.04 --> 3430.5589999999997
like right post-life hell

3428.079 --> 3431.599
right that's what you're saying right

3430.559 --> 3433.2000000000003
post-life hell

3431.599 --> 3435.92
well that's not the hell i'm talking

3433.2 --> 3437.52
about i'm talking about the frequency

3435.92 --> 3439.6800000000003
i'm talking about the function of the

3437.52 --> 3441.7599999999998
design because these are things that i

3439.68 --> 3444.0
can actually check

3441.76 --> 3445.0400000000004
that i can actually say yeah it works

3444.0 --> 3448.48
like this

3445.04 --> 3450.079
i'm not talking about post-death i don't

3448.48 --> 3454.88
know what happens after death

3450.079 --> 3458.88
nobody does i just know

3454.88 --> 3458.88
the world is a lot more complex

3459.119 --> 3464.88
then everybody realizes including people

3462.319 --> 3467.119
that think they realize a lot

3464.88 --> 3470.559
they don't because if you did you'd

3467.119 --> 3470.559
realize you didn't know [ __ ]

3473.68 --> 3482.96
yeah oh the bible disagree with me well

3478.4 --> 3485.44
[ __ ] you then the bible is not a living

3482.96 --> 3486.48
sentient being with a [ __ ] opinion

3485.44 --> 3489.76
it's a book

3486.48 --> 3494.0
it's a book with stories and lessons

3489.76 --> 3497.76
and a very magnificent essence

3494.0 --> 3502.16
it does not disagree

3497.76 --> 3504.7990000000004
it simply tells you what is

3502.16 --> 3506.72
and if you're gonna exeterically scored

3504.799 --> 3507.52
about it all day and then say oh that

3506.72 --> 3509.52
means this

3507.52 --> 3510.72
that means that and then cross-reference

3509.52 --> 3514.839
everything to that

3510.72 --> 3516.8799999999997
yeah wrong exit terrorist

3514.839 --> 3519.839
wrong yeah

3516.88 --> 3521.839
spend your entire life on that and

3519.839 --> 3522.48
thousands of people have that's very

3521.839 --> 3525.44
nice

3522.48 --> 3525.44
it's very nice

3525.52 --> 3530.0
you can't make those statements you

3528.559 --> 3533.92
don't know what the [ __ ] you're

3530.0 --> 3536.72
talking about nicholas riddle you don't

3533.92 --> 3538.16
you're just obsessed in trying to

3536.72 --> 3539.52
delegitimize it

3538.16 --> 3542.24
that's what you're doing that's what you

3539.52 --> 3545.44
have been doing since you came in here

3542.24 --> 3549.52
you're an anti-biblical person

3545.44 --> 3552.2400000000002
you are just say it

3549.52 --> 3554.559
you're an anti-biblical person nicholas

3613.76 --> 3619.92

3617.52 --> 3621.7599999999998

3624.079 --> 3628.6400000000003
the average atheist idiot

3625.92 --> 3630.16
maybe if you're not that pathetic but

3628.64 --> 3632.319
you are an atheist and

3630.16 --> 3635.7599999999998
everything you've done here is literally

3632.319 --> 3635.7599999999998
only to undermine

3636.0 --> 3643.44
the sovereignty of christ

3639.839 --> 3646.48
