Aaron maverick huh skip past you

226.66 --> 231.46
yeah when you scroll on these chats

228.34 --> 234.82
sometimes it just bunk just flips all

231.46 --> 237.42000000000002
the way down it's weird so yeah good

234.82 --> 237.42
morning to you all

247.59 --> 257.169
Wow okay well fellow flat earther it's

254.83 --> 262.75
been quite some time ago since I've had

257.169 --> 266.5
it tested oh because well I from

262.75 --> 268.81
experience and even noticeable tangible

266.5 --> 272.02
experience but also from test results in

268.81 --> 276.19
the past it matters a lot in what kind

272.02 --> 280.38
of state I am what I can do really and

276.19 --> 287.82
how fast I am it really matters a lot so

280.38 --> 287.82
I think

288.65 --> 293.71
what was it

290.86 --> 297.37
I think that as a very young kid when I

293.71 --> 300.90999999999997
was like really I felt like on top of

297.37 --> 304.72
the world I think I had 160 IQ or

300.91 --> 307.27000000000004
something like that and that's probably

304.72 --> 311.77000000000004
because I just was too easily distracted

307.27 --> 313.87
just like I am typically now just like

311.77 --> 317.04999999999995
Oh a new thing I've never seen before

313.87 --> 319.24
let's completely dive into that and get

317.05 --> 324.36
sidetracked I did that a lot when I was

319.24 --> 331.93
a little kid hello Jose and craz crazy

324.36 --> 333.82
cutie here for the lulz but I don't know

331.93 --> 342.01
what it currently is I really don't I

333.82 --> 347.71
think it's probably 140 or on really

342.01 --> 350.98
good days 150 but it's also because like

347.71 --> 354.58
my highest IQ moments really come with

350.98 --> 359.14000000000004
mania and I don't I don't unleash that

354.58 --> 363.09
anymore as much it's because it's

359.14 --> 363.09
dangerous to me

366.01 --> 378.13
so yeah I think but I don't know last

371.83 --> 380.94
time I did a test was relating to like

378.13 --> 383.89
from the from the government a job

380.94 --> 386.98
trajectory thing like something you had

383.89 --> 390.52
to do as part of the social welfare

386.98 --> 393.16
thing in retrospect technically I have

390.52 --> 394.9
never needed to do that but I figured

393.16 --> 396.85
that out afterward and it was kind of

394.9 --> 400.29999999999995
interesting and I got to see a lot of

396.85 --> 402.43
people that were also kind of in similar

400.3 --> 403.90000000000003
positions and I felt really shitty so I

402.43 --> 406.06
kind of appreciate it

403.9 --> 409.15
being forced to be around other people

406.06 --> 412.24
anyway because when I feel shitty I

409.15 --> 421.41999999999996
don't do that naturally I tend to stick

412.24 --> 423.40000000000003
keep everything to myself but I did a

421.42 --> 430.63
test one time but it wasn't an official

423.4 --> 433.78
IQ test but it was like just comparing

430.63 --> 437.74
results with everyone else and I scored

433.78 --> 441.03999999999996
extremely high like I I wasn't like the

437.74 --> 443.11
number one scorer or anything but they

441.04 --> 447.58000000000004
like immediately put me in high tier or

443.11 --> 450.94
like what that's just ridiculous why

447.58 --> 458.38
don't you have a job and I agreed with

450.94 --> 460.99
them so that's it but I I'm fine I'll be

458.38 --> 463.21
fine doing an IQ test you know it it did

460.99 --> 464.95
you know why why I'm fine with it

463.21 --> 468.58
because it doesn't really matter to be

464.95 --> 473.84999999999997
because I Know Who I am and it doesn't

468.58 --> 477.64
matter to me how how what my IQ is

473.85 --> 481.36
technically because I also know that I

477.64 --> 483.58
can be quite [ __ ] at times so IQ

481.36 --> 484.99
doesn't mean anything it's not a

483.58 --> 487.18
fail-safe mechanism

484.99 --> 490.0
quite the contrary actually the more

487.18 --> 493.0
intelligent you are the more you tend to

490.0 --> 496.49
be prone to your intelligence being

493.0 --> 499.379
abused by your own feelings yeah

496.49 --> 501.56
that happens accidentally you get caught

499.379 --> 503.97
in a web made by your subconscious

501.56 --> 507.479
that's what a lot of these ballers are

503.97 --> 509.699
drowning in because they are IQ

507.479 --> 511.56
intelligent but they just don't know how

509.699 --> 515.519
to manage themselves so their

511.56 --> 517.89
subconscious manages them for them but

515.519 --> 521.339
not in a particularly productive way for

517.89 --> 523.89
themselves it's more like a bunch of

521.339 --> 526.11
servants just prime protects the

523.89 --> 528.12
feelings of the noble person that kind

526.11 --> 531.9590000000001
of set up that's what it's really like

528.12 --> 535.079
for them that true conscious is being

531.959 --> 536.67
protected by the mechanisms installed by

535.079 --> 539.399
their own intelligence through their

536.67 --> 541.29
self-conscious to protect them from

539.399 --> 545.54
awakening from the dream that has been

541.29 --> 545.54
prioritized above all else

555.18 --> 560.64
now I used to be very all IQ IQ and

558.39 --> 567.09
always somebody was smarter I always be

560.64 --> 570.83
like it's so stupid because it played on

567.09 --> 574.2
my feelings mostly and my feelings

570.83 --> 576.84
influenced intelligent my intelligence

574.2 --> 580.86
enormous ly so it is kind of like it's

576.84 --> 584.37
yeah it's just completely useless to

580.86 --> 584.91
take it seriously if you take it

584.37 --> 591.59
seriously

584.91 --> 591.5899999999999
it will probably degrade you in some way

595.31 --> 598.88
unless you don't care

600.29 --> 609.3
and then yeah you can use it as a

603.72 --> 612.12
statistical average sure yeah but it I

609.3 --> 617.0899999999999
think a true intelligence IQ test would

612.12 --> 620.13
be much wider and put people under in

617.09 --> 622.62
certain circumstances like do the same

620.13 --> 625.95
kind of thing or maybe a trajectory

622.62 --> 629.04
where each of the test will be performed

625.95 --> 632.4300000000001
under specific type of conditions so

629.04 --> 634.7099999999999
some will be under duress or while they

632.43 --> 636.93
are being constantly distracted up to a

634.71 --> 640.5600000000001
certain level and you could even amp it

636.93 --> 643.1999999999999
up if the subjects would be sooo would

640.56 --> 646.0699999999999
want to go through all of that and then

643.2 --> 648.9300000000001
you can get a full spectrum intelligence

646.07 --> 650.6400000000001
like in air like how is their

648.93 --> 652.29
intelligence under these conditions and

650.64 --> 655.17
under these conditions and under these

652.29 --> 657.9599999999999
conditions now there you got a full

655.17 --> 662.43
spectrum insight on functionality which

657.96 --> 664.9200000000001
is what IQ test supposedly are about but

662.43 --> 667.7399999999999
it would not be as very simple test you

664.92 --> 671.5999999999999
just did in 10 or 30 minutes or

667.74 --> 673.77
something that's gonna be quite a

671.6 --> 675.26
trajectory like that's gonna take

673.77 --> 679.16
several hours at least

675.26 --> 694.41
so yeah

679.16 --> 699.63
that's my opinion about it really Oh two

694.41 --> 701.55
hours each wow that's a lot I don't

699.63 --> 708.2
think I've ever been subjected to that

701.55 --> 714.17
long a test I think one time I had a

708.2 --> 714.1700000000001
test that lasted for me I think an hour

716.21 --> 721.47
yeah now that now that you mentioned I

719.22 --> 723.45
think they did actually put me through

721.47 --> 728.4200000000001
they had they let me waiting at a

723.45 --> 732.8100000000001
certain point but they did all kinds of

728.42 --> 734.91
thing is test me no way that there was

732.81 --> 738.51
an IQ test I think that had to do with

734.91 --> 739.4399999999999
like psychological tests that was when I

738.51 --> 742.77
was really young

739.44 --> 745.5500000000001
it's weird did I remember that like

742.77 --> 745.55
really young

749.22 --> 752.419
[Music]

757.02 --> 768.41
that really rested s hilarious all right

769.27 --> 772.05
cool

777.15 --> 782.699
really

779.699 --> 782.699
yeah

788.21 --> 791.969
[Music]

793.47 --> 800.7900000000001
isn't intelligence just having a good

795.959 --> 805.41
memory well it I think it's part of it

800.79 --> 809.399
but it's also just quickness of insight

805.41 --> 813.0889999999999
and improvisation strength and quickness

809.399 --> 817.91
all that it's really about the

813.089 --> 817.9100000000001
utilization so

828.82 --> 837.0100000000001
no critical thinking no critical

833.98 --> 840.22
thinking is not that's an EQ test

837.01 --> 843.33
related thing not IQ test

840.22 --> 843.33
Trish Blythe

855.12 --> 858.289
[Music]

872.32 --> 890.63
okay Trish light right yeah right but

887.66 --> 893.51
anyway for the long run memory does

890.63 --> 895.7
matter but memory is kind of a

893.51 --> 905.12
mysterious thing I don't know it is to

895.7 --> 909.7900000000001
me at least because well you have memory

905.12 --> 916.43
is all about what is available to you

909.79 --> 919.4499999999999
what is your subconscious allowing to

916.43 --> 922.1899999999999
your like how wide does your

919.45 --> 924.62
subconscious allow your memory to be

922.19 --> 926.24
accessible to your consciousness that's

924.62 --> 929.99
really a big thing and when you're very

926.24 --> 933.05
young it's absolute usually unless you

929.99 --> 941.45
get poison or something because toxicity

933.05 --> 944.29
over time degrades all of it but now I

941.45 --> 944.2900000000001
lost my train of thought

946.37 --> 952.37
yeah when you're young you get full

950.269 --> 955.55
access to all the memories everything

952.37 --> 959.66
that's available to you but then as you

955.55 --> 963.04
grow older you bump into things that

959.66 --> 965.42
make you make your subconscious isolate

963.04 --> 968.149
certain things from you because suddenly

965.42 --> 970.189
it hurts and that's when your memory

968.149 --> 972.29
starts to fracture basically that's when

970.189 --> 977.809
issue starts to pile up demons start to

972.29 --> 980.12
arrive to take away the energy from the

977.809 --> 983.079
memory it's it's weird stuff it's when

980.12 --> 986.629
people that's what happens to people and

983.079 --> 990.3499999999999
when you resolve all the issues all the

986.629 --> 993.439
hurt and allow all of it to basically

990.35 --> 996.61
come back to you which is extremely

993.439 --> 1001.0889999999999
tough for most people it's for anyone

996.61 --> 1004.3290000000001
then you can re attain that full

1001.089 --> 1009.3000000000001
capacity of your memory and that is what

1004.329 --> 1009.3
basically shamans try to achieve to

1011.99 --> 1021.16
to restore it all and then live pure

1017.5 --> 1024.4
basically according to the path because

1021.16 --> 1029.1789999999999
yeah if you don't it's going to degrade

1024.4 --> 1034.99
it requires a lot of maintenance to keep

1029.179 --> 1034.99
it open like that to stay focused

1042.489 --> 1047.979
what

1043.91 --> 1047.979
[Music]

1049.85 --> 1058.6999999999998
you used to rehabilitate kangaroos when

1055.81 --> 1061.09
you mean that got in accidents or

1058.7 --> 1061.0900000000001
something

1066.18 --> 1073.41
all right yeah sorry I wasn't paying a

1069.06 --> 1079.7
lot of tension to chat Wow at Aaron

1073.41 --> 1086.51
maverick I don't think my IQ is 250 no

1079.7 --> 1090.54
that's that is insane look I see things

1086.51 --> 1094.11
but it's not like I am performing super

1090.54 --> 1096.21
compacted Micro calculations very

1094.11 --> 1099.4699999999998
quickly like that I'm not like a

1096.21 --> 1099.47
supercomputer okay

1099.89 --> 1108.75
I've just been weirdly it had a very

1104.19 --> 1112.26
bizarre experience and it kind of opened

1108.75 --> 1115.35
me up to the timeless truth sort of

1112.26 --> 1124.02
thing to the Akashic library and it was

1115.35 --> 1128.07
already very young and yeah I just take

1124.02 --> 1130.71
it I don't think it's intelligence based

1128.07 --> 1132.6899999999998
really I don't even take it as like oh

1130.71 --> 1141.8400000000001
my god I did so much work but now it

1132.69 --> 1145.74
just I'm ready to receive the ideas I am

1141.84 --> 1148.98
open for it and I I look I stare in the

1145.74 --> 1152.25
distance kind of thing all the time just

1148.98 --> 1154.74
pondering and just wondering like hoping

1152.25 --> 1157.52
to bump into a new thing and yeah that's

1154.74 --> 1157.52
what I do a lot

1159.7 --> 1166.27
I used to think that that is kind of

1162.79 --> 1171.3899999999999
like what an Oracle does but anyway

1166.27 --> 1171.3899999999999
that's probably not correct

1189.89 --> 1199.45
[Music]

1195.97 --> 1202.57
right Ian Adams it's a it's a good point

1199.45 --> 1205.299
society puts too much pressure on people

1202.57 --> 1212.86
that's what's causing mental health

1205.299 --> 1216.82
issues well it's basically also because

1212.86 --> 1222.58
people let that let society do that to

1216.82 --> 1229.539
them and then kind of like in the

1222.58 --> 1233.23
shadows they try to adapt and yeah it's

1229.539 --> 1236.259
very weird like in the old days you

1233.23 --> 1239.23
there's clear historical cases about

1236.259 --> 1241.3890000000001
this people would get married for

1239.23 --> 1244.98
financial reasons that was much more

1241.389 --> 1247.6
common in the old days like say before

1244.98 --> 1250.419
two hundred years ago that was kind of

1247.6 --> 1254.1999999999998
normal and if you got married for love

1250.419 --> 1257.8790000000001
that was almost unheard of or just like

1254.2 --> 1263.98
what really are you serious that but

1257.879 --> 1267.6
nowadays people and I'm talking quite

1263.98 --> 1270.3990000000001
broadly actually take on mental health

1267.6 --> 1273.279
problems which were already there and

1270.399 --> 1276.789
instead of battling them and conquering

1273.279 --> 1280.72
them they actually embrace them for

1276.789 --> 1283.299
financial gain so instead of marriage

1280.72 --> 1288.99
people now attain mental health problems

1283.299 --> 1293.08
for financial gain it's a very bizarre

1288.99 --> 1296.259
transformation that is extremely

1293.08 --> 1298.99
counterproductive and that's also why I

1296.259 --> 1302.83
never did that I've always said oh oh

1298.99 --> 1306.34
yeah man oh yeah oh think I can't think

1302.83 --> 1308.019
up some kind of weird giant complex of

1306.34 --> 1310.75
mental health issues and get it all

1308.019 --> 1313.8700000000001
defined and all you know I'm so I'm so

1310.75 --> 1316.09
you I'm sure yeah that's great help okay

1313.87 --> 1318.1
I could do that get all this money and

1316.09 --> 1321.0
get bothered all day by people that are

1318.1 --> 1325.389
trying to poopoo you because you're well

1321.0 --> 1327.94
[ __ ] to them no thanks I'd rather

1325.389 --> 1329.4099999999999
live a little bit more poor and I still

1327.94 --> 1335.68
have some dignity

1329.41 --> 1341.44
so but it is yeah a lot of people do

1335.68 --> 1344.14
that a lot it's quite disturbing to me

1341.44 --> 1350.23
every time I find that out because of

1344.14 --> 1352.89
the potential long-term consequences so

1350.23 --> 1358.84
yeah I decided to not do that and

1352.89 --> 1361.7800000000002
instead suffer through it test myself it

1358.84 --> 1363.85
was like I was already kind of bleak in

1361.78 --> 1366.58
my outlook even in my twenty so I

1363.85 --> 1370.09
thought like yeah okay well I'm not

1366.58 --> 1373.87
gonna go decock the obvious total Kocher

1370.09 --> 1376.24
out where my ego will absolutely just it

1373.87 --> 1378.01
will be so humiliating to me with

1376.24 --> 1380.68
somebody with my intelligence together

1378.01 --> 1383.29
like no I would probably kill myself and

1380.68 --> 1388.54
if I had done that so I thought no I'll

1383.29 --> 1391.35
just let society well I was kind of

1388.54 --> 1398.25
bleak just thought let's let it ruin me

1391.35 --> 1402.55
but my instinct just kept on intervening

1398.25 --> 1407.14
like no no you're not gonna do this no

1402.55 --> 1410.8899999999999
you're not gonna do that you're just if

1407.14 --> 1413.38
you can't engage in the society in a

1410.89 --> 1417.0700000000002
normal way without ruining everything on

1413.38 --> 1421.45
purpose by accident as it were it's it's

1417.07 --> 1423.6899999999998
weird like subconscious can do that then

1421.45 --> 1427.57
just don't do anything and just sit back

1423.69 --> 1433.18
kind of go in hibernation mode like a

1427.57 --> 1434.98
bear for a long period and that's what

1433.18 --> 1437.8600000000001
I've been doing kind of on and off

1434.98 --> 1441.04
that's sometimes I then completely

1437.86 --> 1443.34
awaken and just burst with ideas and

1441.04 --> 1443.34
just

1450.14 --> 1466.1000000000001
ah fresh air watch there uh oh god all

1462.87 --> 1466.1
these questions all of a sudden

1472.34 --> 1481.6599999999999
I don't know what you're talking about I

1477.97 --> 1486.41
went to bed pretty early yesterday I

1481.66 --> 1488.5900000000001
really needed it I haven't seen gratis

1486.41 --> 1488.5900000000001
or

1497.95 --> 1509.3990000000001
research done by fpv NGO well I remember

1504.33 --> 1513.58
he does a it's been a while I haven't

1509.399 --> 1515.32
kept track so I don't know it's been

1513.58 --> 1518.62
like at least half a year since I last

1515.32 --> 1528.549
that look at him or her I don't even

1518.62 --> 1532.029
remember if it's a more super curve yeah

1528.549 --> 1536.2
I don't need any advice from you a super

1532.029 --> 1540.84
curve okay what I'm talking about what I

1536.2 --> 1544.6200000000001
was talking about was twenty years ago

1540.84 --> 1548.379
over time okay these last five years

1544.62 --> 1550.6589999999999
I've pretty much I'm starting yeah it's

1548.379 --> 1552.9089999999999
like the final awakening to that

1550.659 --> 1554.7990000000002
situation where the full memory of

1552.909 --> 1557.769
things as I just started to describe it

1554.799 --> 1559.269
first completely comes back to you just

1557.769 --> 1561.879
like as when you're a child

1559.269 --> 1564.309
certainly the memory becomes so much

1561.879 --> 1566.529
better and your attunements to

1564.309 --> 1574.6589999999999
frequencies of things become so much

1566.529 --> 1577.779
better that's where I'm at so I'm not

1574.659 --> 1579.8500000000001
I'm not using YouTube to resolve it

1577.779 --> 1583.87
although you know what in a way I kind

1579.85 --> 1588.549
of am I'm using myself as an open study

1583.87 --> 1591.9699999999998
case for people to show what I've been

1588.549 --> 1594.25
through how I experienced it try to

1591.97 --> 1596.59
convey the actual depth of the feelings

1594.25 --> 1599.32
of it and the pressure and then show

1596.59 --> 1602.549
what I did and how I looked at it in a

1599.32 --> 1605.11
different periods so any person that's

1602.549 --> 1607.87
seemingly going through similar things

1605.11 --> 1610.539
can take a look at it maybe recognize

1607.87 --> 1613.0
certain elements and then I think wait

1610.539 --> 1615.37
I'm thinking about it right now like

1613.0 --> 1618.19
this that sounds so much just like that

1615.37 --> 1622.9899999999998
and then he said that in that time later

1618.19 --> 1625.1200000000001
this is how that was and so yeah I could

1622.99 --> 1627.059
potentially give them a little bit more

1625.12 --> 1630.6499999999999
confidence that things will be alright

1627.059 --> 1633.95
by giving them an outlook as to what

1630.65 --> 1636.5590000000002
they might be moving towards and they

1633.95 --> 1649.25
don't even have to tell me they can just

1636.559 --> 1654.5
reflect upon what I say what no I am

1649.25 --> 1657.559
pretty okay okay a lot of my duress on

1654.5 --> 1661.18
YouTube is due to financial situations

1657.559 --> 1665.21
that can get pretty dire with me and

1661.18 --> 1667.6100000000001
that can like it's it's kind of a

1665.21 --> 1670.39
weakness thing in the sense that some

1667.61 --> 1673.6399999999999
people would have like phobias for

1670.39 --> 1676.75
spiders and [ __ ] right well I have a

1673.64 --> 1679.97
phobia for being in financial trouble I

1676.75 --> 1682.13
panic with that [ __ ] it's very tough I'm

1679.97 --> 1683.78
doing much better with it than say five

1682.13 --> 1691.94
years ago when I got into big trouble

1683.78 --> 1700.76
then that it's surreal how much that

1691.94 --> 1703.19
pressures me right and that is some of

1700.76 --> 1710.559
the high pressure that you sometimes get

1703.19 --> 1715.1000000000001
to see but it's not like I any yeah it

1710.559 --> 1717.95
what it does is the pressure become so

1715.1 --> 1719.84
high that in the face of it what I'm

1717.95 --> 1722.3300000000002
doing just seems to be ineffective

1719.84 --> 1725.0
that's what I expressed in my rage and

1722.33 --> 1728.53
then it's like the pressure is basically

1725.0 --> 1733.15
saying I don't want to get here again

1728.53 --> 1737.6789999999999
this is you have a much dressing myself

1733.15 --> 1740.8090000000002
you have a much better outlook and

1737.679 --> 1744.2
control and insight and control over

1740.809 --> 1750.44
yourself to be able to actually do

1744.2 --> 1752.8400000000001
something now do it that's what I was

1750.44 --> 1754.94
busy that's what that pressure was in

1752.84 --> 1757.25
almost in a personified way that rage

1754.94 --> 1763.3700000000001
that part of me was telling myself

1757.25 --> 1767.42
because who I my calm me

1763.37 --> 1772.28
what most of you know is like really I

1767.42 --> 1777.92
really like stability things staying the

1772.28 --> 1781.37
same if I have outlook of that then I am

1777.92 --> 1783.8600000000001
the most fluid and my thoughts are the

1781.37 --> 1787.6699999999998
freest that is what you're seeing it

1783.86 --> 1791.36
right here so these priorities conflict

1787.67 --> 1793.76
and have severe impact on what I can do

1791.36 --> 1796.9399999999998
and I try to convey this pretty early on

1793.76 --> 1800.84
like like if my financial situation is

1796.94 --> 1804.25
not gonna improve I have to deflect and

1800.84 --> 1808.97
do something else and that would just

1804.25 --> 1810.52
change me in a way that I can't really

1808.97 --> 1814.01
do this anymore

1810.52 --> 1817.37
so but I don't know where it's going

1814.01 --> 1821.81
right now I'm still gonna engage with

1817.37 --> 1824.2299999999998
all that but I have I've gotten some

1821.81 --> 1825.8899999999999
breathing room mostly thanks to Rhys

1824.23 --> 1828.32
who's Gav

1825.89 --> 1833.0600000000002
yeah who gave me this generous donation

1828.32 --> 1835.82
through PayPal and that really saved my

1833.06 --> 1841.31
neck for this tough week that I had to

1835.82 --> 1843.29
look forward to because after this week

1841.31 --> 1845.45
that's when my finances start to roll in

1843.29 --> 1849.46
again so this basically means he kind of

1845.45 --> 1849.46
guaranteed my survival all of a sudden

1850.45 --> 1855.79
and then I can calm the [ __ ] down

1863.34 --> 1866.359
[Music]

1870.029 --> 1874.639

there was Watson I haven't really

1899.63 --> 1904.68
actively engaged yet

1902.04 --> 1908.37
I potentially could have done that this

1904.68 --> 1912.47
morning but I was just yeah didn't

1908.37 --> 1916.31
really have the time or yeah or the

1912.47 --> 1916.31
momentum yet to do that

1921.71 --> 1929.799
okay thanks only sheep who can't see I

lot of you that I won't recognize just

gonna help convincing him or giving him

2110.36 --> 2118.4900000000002
some insight on on this thing you know

2115.7 --> 2123.0699999999997
patronization actually tends to

2118.49 --> 2123.0699999999997
deactivate intelligence with most people

2129.839 --> 2137.5299999999997
to Munich very far away David Irving I

2134.13 --> 2145.3900000000003
live in Netherlands so Munich is like

2137.53 --> 2149.4700000000003
that's East Germany I think I think that

2145.39 --> 2151.7799999999997
maybe like 500 or 600 kilometers away

2149.47 --> 2157.14
something I don't know I could google it

2151.78 --> 2157.1400000000003

get drunk there unless I don't know

unless the atmosphere is really really

2184.119 --> 2187.8900000000003

2313.39 --> 2315.66
it

2320.97 --> 2327.9599999999996
it may be kind of weird because I might

2323.55 --> 2330.75
be really nervous which is very unusual

2327.96 --> 2331.44
since I'm not nervous at all over the

2330.75 --> 2335.88
Internet

2331.44 --> 2337.9500000000003
I'm just say I don't know yet usually

2335.88 --> 2341.31

2337.95 --> 2344.2799999999997
basically come in their space and our us

2341.31 --> 2350.2799999999997

2350.28 --> 2355.13
circle of people physically so

2362.39 --> 2374.27

2368.57 --> 2378.3500000000004
it's kind of weird I I'm five foot seven

2374.27 --> 2380.5099999999998
and I thought I was really small but I

2378.35 --> 2383.24
guess that's maybe because in the

2380.51 --> 2385.9
Netherlands there are just plenty of

2383.24 --> 2385.8999999999996
tall people

2392.06 --> 2400.85
I'm by the way a lot taller than my dad

2394.85 --> 2404.0299999999997
is I think I'm not sure how how tall my

2400.85 --> 2410.7799999999997
brother is but I think I might now be

2404.03 --> 2416.96
the tallest of them all probably also

2410.78 --> 2421.01
because of my focused diet and not yea

2416.96 --> 2423.23
and actively resolving issues a lot and

2421.01 --> 2428.0600000000004
not yea and like the rest of my family

2423.23 --> 2431.41
that have the same tendencies as me but

2428.06 --> 2431.41
they don't deal with it like that

2432.88 --> 2439.33
dammit this is fruit fly

2439.45 --> 2444.0989999999997
why did you always have to go right in

2442.299 --> 2447.299
front of my nose right

2444.099 --> 2447.299
during hangouts

2448.02 --> 2451.82
[Music]

2456.93 --> 2460.04
[Music]

2463.14 --> 2471.46
right

2465.43 --> 2475.96
ACK absolutely Rory its if you feel tall

2471.46 --> 2479.8
and powerful it will have like this

2475.96 --> 2482.65
weird effect where it's almost seemingly

2479.8 --> 2486.4900000000002
like space bends making you taller in

2482.65 --> 2489.34
comparison in the eyes it's yeah I agree

2486.49 --> 2492.22
to that when I feel very confident and

2489.34 --> 2494.53
like really seething with power and I

2492.22 --> 2500.52
have those moments usually

2494.53 --> 2500.52
purpose-driven then I do feel very big

2501.21 --> 2508.77
and I tend to stand very tall as well

2510.1 --> 2515.56
yeah no that's not coffee this is tea I

2513.19 --> 2521.17
already got through my coffee I only get

2515.56 --> 2528.21
one cup they tend to just chug it or

2521.17 --> 2528.21
it'll get cold this

2530.76 --> 2533.8190000000004
[Music]

2536.62 --> 2539.71
[Music]

2546.74 --> 2552.14
super curfew don't even know how gravity

2549.66 --> 2552.14
does that

2556.109 --> 2569.279
because you don't know what it is yeah

2564.479 --> 2571.3799999999997
that's very nice I know you yeah your

2569.279 --> 2574.049
back goes at ease because because of the

2571.38 --> 2578.88
orientation the fluids inside of you

2574.049 --> 2581.16
will tend to go to sideways because down

2578.88 --> 2582.9
there or it's relative density

2581.16 --> 2585.8089999999997
equilibrium point will be of those

2582.9 --> 2587.759
fluids even though it's semi part of

2585.809 --> 2590.3390000000004
your system as it were it's inside of

2587.759 --> 2593.219
you like a balloon it'll go sideways

2590.339 --> 2596.88
because it can't go down but if you're

2593.219 --> 2599.279
orientated vertically like standing then

2596.88 --> 2601.469
it's all gonna press down because your

2599.279 --> 2602.609
feet can't move any further so you are

2601.469 --> 2605.13
at full arrest

2602.609 --> 2607.259
and then it trended this equilibrium

2605.13 --> 2608.609
translates to pressure and that's what

2607.259 --> 2610.709
causes all that pressure on your

2608.609 --> 2614.7889999999998
skeleton and that's what most of your

2610.709 --> 2619.259
blood tends to go downwards towards your

2614.789 --> 2621.9590000000003
lower body in your feet and your blood

2619.259 --> 2625.14
vessels we'll put an extra effort to

2621.959 --> 2627.0589999999997
keep sufficient amounts of blood up

2625.14 --> 2629.729
there depending on your total blood

2627.059 --> 2631.7290000000003
pressure but that's all because of

2629.729 --> 2634.439
relative density this equilibrium

2631.729 --> 2636.8289999999997
there's nothing to do with gravity which

2634.439 --> 2641.1189999999997
you don't even know how it would do that

2636.829 --> 2641.119
because you don't know what gravity is

2658.7 --> 2662.31
[Music]

2670.57 --> 2675.04
yeah that's correct charlie but it is

2674.68 --> 2677.3799999999997
hot

2675.04 --> 2680.14
look I you know what I'm just gonna

2677.38 --> 2685.0
freakin demonstrated you know it's all

2680.14 --> 2689.71
about the posture so when I tend to feel

2685.0 --> 2693.82
kind enough like nervous I stand like

2689.71 --> 2696.51
this right see how tall I am well when I

2693.82 --> 2696.51
feel great

2696.93 --> 2700.2
see the difference

2704.98 --> 2710.89
[Music]

2707.93 --> 2710.89
so yeah

2720.509 --> 2732.099
now that's a demonstration independent

2726.94 --> 2736.839
variable my tension and I can simulate

2732.099 --> 2741.279
that so it was basically a simulation no

2736.839 --> 2745.92
wasn't in the second time the top of my

2741.279 --> 2754.029
hair was cut off was a clear difference

2745.92 --> 2756.73
playback you'll see no I'm not gonna lay

2754.029 --> 2760.119
on the bed super curve I'm I'm gonna sit

2756.73 --> 2765.849
right here and talk in a microphone drop

2760.119 --> 2767.98
it he'd and it's not proofing gravity

2765.849 --> 2770.4990000000003
nothing proves gravity because you don't

2767.98 --> 2772.18
know how gravity is even supposed to

2770.499 --> 2773.339
cause anything because you don't know

2772.18 --> 2776.319
what it is

2773.339 --> 2778.69
okay so why don't you address that

2776.319 --> 2781.119
before just putting your freaking

2778.69 --> 2783.4
gravity stamp on anything when you

2781.119 --> 2785.1400000000003
really don't even know how it supposed

2783.4 --> 2791.739
to be causing that because you don't

2785.14 --> 2793.749
know what it is you just think you know

2791.739 --> 2796.15
what it is and you're not finding out

2793.749 --> 2797.9199999999996
because it's very confusing to find out

2796.15 --> 2800.349
that nothing about it makes any damn

2797.92 --> 2804.13
sense now is it but that's the truth

2800.349 --> 2807.2490000000003
that's the official truth so deal with

2804.13 --> 2809.1400000000003
it and stop putting those stupid gravity

2807.249 --> 2811.7099999999996
stamps on everything when you don't even

2809.14 --> 2811.71
know what it is

2833.41 --> 2836.48
[Music]

2838.02 --> 2846.57
yes charlie that's exactly what that

2841.44 --> 2848.7000000000003
means you dumbass if you don't know what

2846.57 --> 2853.4300000000003
it is then how can you even claim that

2848.7 --> 2863.5989999999997
something is caused by it you idiot oh

2853.43 --> 2863.5989999999997
my god are you [ __ ] charlie

2866.49 --> 2869.6899999999996
[Music]

2871.749 --> 2879.9489999999996
no Charlie that that doesn't make any

2876.739 --> 2882.949
sense because the fire is there right

2879.949 --> 2884.989
and then they can figure out how to make

2882.949 --> 2887.39
that fire well why don't you try that

2884.989 --> 2890.299
with gravity and stop assuming

2887.39 --> 2892.519
everything does that and actually look

2890.299 --> 2897.079
into what gravity is supposed to be and

2892.519 --> 2900.709
do and then come back at me because what

2897.079 --> 2905.9190000000003
you think gravity does is not officially

2900.709 --> 2908.919
true by your own body of science okay

2905.919 --> 2908.919
dumbass

2922.83 --> 2925.67
Batman

2928.73 --> 2938.67
yeah well you know what fire is actually

2932.759 --> 2941.279
a thing that you can do things with with

2938.67 --> 2944.4300000000003
gravity however you first need to know

2941.279 --> 2951.829
what it is in order to determine that

2944.43 --> 2955.499
it's there you [ __ ] [ __ ] you [ __ ]

2951.829 --> 2959.809
if you don't even know what it is how

2955.499 --> 2959.8089999999997
can you claim it's there you idiot

2964.34 --> 2970.3500000000004
[Music]

2971.619 --> 2981.19
no that's not gravity you don't know

2976.94 --> 2985.28
what gravity does but it doesn't do that

2981.19 --> 2988.31
okay yeah you can drop something and

2985.28 --> 2991.7900000000004
then call it gravity but that doesn't

2988.31 --> 2995.15
prove that that is caused by gravity

2991.79 --> 2998.0299999999997
because you don't even know how gravity

2995.15 --> 3000.9300000000003
is supposed to be causing that why don't

2998.03 --> 3006.67
you look into what gravity is officially

3000.93 --> 3008.83
super curved what it is what it's

3006.67 --> 3012.58
supposed to be doing what it's supposed

3008.83 --> 3022.69
to be actually affecting okay no that's

3012.58 --> 3025.29
not gravity it's displacement something

3022.69 --> 3028.21
is displacing that doesn't prove that

3025.29 --> 3030.55
fictional gravity you think that is

3028.21 --> 3031.0
supposedly there are everywhere all the

3030.55 --> 3033.94
time

3031.0 --> 3036.73
because you can't scientifically prove

3033.94 --> 3041.67
it is there that doesn't work and

3036.73 --> 3048.96
besides the official narrative is not

3041.67 --> 3053.32
trying to do that it gave it up remember

3048.96 --> 3055.39
remember why they gave it up why

3053.32 --> 3058.1800000000003
universities don't spend any more time

3055.39 --> 3061.3199999999997
on that approach and just do with

3058.18 --> 3065.95
graviton particles and all this weird

3061.32 --> 3068.77
unattainable fields speculation right

3065.95 --> 3075.93
and not that not the physical [ __ ]

3068.77 --> 3079.48
because they gave up on it okay

3075.93 --> 3081.48
it's no longer relevant it's no longer

3079.48 --> 3085.6
viable they're not using it anymore

3081.48 --> 3089.35
because they know it's not viable it's

3085.6 --> 3091.75
not scientific and besides the founder

3089.35 --> 3094.63
of that entire system did never claim

3091.75 --> 3096.91
hypotheses for gravity so it's

3094.63 --> 3102.06
ridiculous and they know it it's just

3096.91 --> 3102.06
you who too dumb to know it as well

3106.09 --> 3109.57
[Music]

3114.06 --> 3119.74
no they gave up on Newtonian gravity

3117.04 --> 3122.11
where the supposed might drop and the

3119.74 --> 3124.8999999999996
conceptualization of a force

3122.11 --> 3126.9700000000003
disequilibrium being present at all time

3124.9 --> 3130.33
supposedly going towards the center of

3126.97 --> 3136.0
the earth that no longer works it's not

3130.33 --> 3140.89
what gravity causes why don't you look

3136.0 --> 3143.32
into gravity one it does how and then

3140.89 --> 3146.83
get back to me how that actually ties in

3143.32 --> 3152.38
to what gravity is how gravitons make

3146.83 --> 3157.0299999999997
things go towards center of ball how do

3152.38 --> 3159.9100000000003
gravitons do that do you know you don't

3157.03 --> 3162.7900000000004
do you because it's just some idea some

3159.91 --> 3164.71
ooh mysterious suppose that particle way

3162.79 --> 3167.71
you don't understand what the [ __ ] that

3164.71 --> 3170.32
supposed to be doing because nobody does

3167.71 --> 3172.45
it's just another fictional thing they

3170.32 --> 3175.4500000000003
stamp gravity on out of desperation

3172.45 --> 3179.6699999999996
because any earthly ties to gravity have

3175.45 --> 3179.6699999999996
been dead and buried for over 80 years

3183.96 --> 3187.62
or whatever it was

3199.609 --> 3208.279
yeah picky for us very very picky so

3203.599 --> 3210.9500000000003
yeah you pick out how it picks things on

3208.279 --> 3213.459
you describe it where the actual gravity

3210.95 --> 3218.209
actually comes in and does something

3213.459 --> 3221.989
kind of tough isn't it because there is

3218.209 --> 3224.749
no real tie in you can dream about it

3221.989 --> 3227.7490000000003
you can try to in visual eyes it but

3224.749 --> 3232.1299999999997
it's not really there in the official

3227.749 --> 3237.5589999999997
research they keep it away from the

3232.13 --> 3239.569
physical as much as they can not explain

3237.559 --> 3244.779
how all these things are supposed to

3239.569 --> 3244.779
because in the old Newtonian stuff

3249.35 --> 3257.7599999999998
yeah false equivalencies you don't need

3254.46 --> 3263.48
to repeat that super curve what you need

3257.76 --> 3263.48
to do is listen or get out of my chat

3273.42 --> 3278.13
and stop repeating the same [ __ ] over

3276.18 --> 3283.6499999999996
and over again actually address what I'm

3278.13 --> 3287.2200000000003
saying here you can say no on to that

3283.65 --> 3290.1
you can respond notes not true and then

3287.22 --> 3291.8999999999996
I will ask you okay well why don't you

3290.1 --> 3297.5099999999998
actually show me the proof that that's

3291.9 --> 3299.94
not true and show me where officially

3297.51 --> 3303.2700000000004
gravity starts to tie into physical

3299.94 --> 3305.82
displacement again how that works by who

3303.27 --> 3309.81
and not some fictional science fiction

3305.82 --> 3313.77
writer no some actual official science

3309.81 --> 3316.32
and and that means independent variable

3313.77 --> 3319.08
based science by the way some real

3316.32 --> 3321.3
serious people not just some pretender

3319.08 --> 3329.25
clowns in universities going along with

3321.3 --> 3336.57
all the nonsense but people that are

3329.25 --> 3339.75
actually serious about science I usually

3336.57 --> 3342.1800000000003
don't go as much in the foreground good

3339.75 --> 3344.66
causes yeah they know I don't people

3342.18 --> 3344.66
really are

3357.48 --> 3365.609
prove what is fake gravity proof gravity

3361.589 --> 3369.0
is fake well why don't you prove what it

3365.609 --> 3371.99
actually does and with proof I don't

3369.0 --> 3376.2
mean freaking displays things but first

3371.99 --> 3380.72
look into your body of science about

3376.2 --> 3385.109
gravity and then figure out with

3380.72 --> 3391.02
traceable evidence empirically where

3385.109 --> 3392.24
it's supposed to be doing anything all

3391.02 --> 3397.14
right

3392.24 --> 3399.99
figure that one out from you start at

3397.14 --> 3402.99
Einstein it's basically the official

3399.99 --> 3407.91
holder of the narrative of gravity and

3402.99 --> 3411.2099999999996
then you migrate that through whatever

3407.91 --> 3415.3799999999997
process scientific into the actual

3411.21 --> 3418.64
empirical data that proves that gravity

3415.38 --> 3418.6400000000003
that that works

3444.77 --> 3453.65
Oh Don Diego I absolutely understand the

3448.28 --> 3456.05
density of the situation because I have

3453.65 --> 3459.23
an actual viable hypothesis based

3456.05 --> 3461.69
explanation for all these things all of

3459.23 --> 3463.4900000000002
you people call gravity and I used to

3461.69 --> 3467.119
call it gravity because I didn't know

3463.49 --> 3469.64
yet how deep this thing went what it is

3467.119 --> 3473.69
it's an aberration I've been saying it

3469.64 --> 3479.18
for a long time now and it is and I know

3473.69 --> 3481.82
exactly how to conceptualize and all the

3479.18 --> 3484.8999999999996
tie ins with gravity by now but I also

3481.82 --> 3487.79
know a more viable hypothesis based

3484.9 --> 3490.4500000000003
explanation for the displacement that

3487.79 --> 3493.7599999999998
has been previously mistaken or

3490.45 --> 3496.99
purposely brainwashed into the people as

3493.76 --> 3496.9900000000002
being gravity

3502.51 --> 3508.9500000000003
what sorted by self

3512.109 --> 3517.719
right yeah but there is no centrifugal

3515.2 --> 3520.3489999999997
forces in this case super curved and

3517.719 --> 3523.93
besides with the centrifugal force the

3520.349 --> 3529.9
higher density tends to go to the

3523.93 --> 3532.589
outside not to the inside so that

3529.9 --> 3532.589
doesn't make any sense

3536.099 --> 3541.949
and besides there is relative density

3539.309 --> 3547.2290000000003
disequilibrium force going on plenty of

3541.949 --> 3550.17
it can prove it now what the actual

3547.229 --> 3553.229
division what causes that

3550.17 --> 3555.299
what causes relative density that theory

3553.229 --> 3557.489
that proven scientifically provable

3555.299 --> 3559.199
theory and repeatable as many times as

3557.489 --> 3560.849
you like or not like but it's going to

3559.199 --> 3563.789
be done anyway because it is

3560.849 --> 3566.3900000000003
scientifically proven and provable and

3563.789 --> 3566.3900000000003
repeatable

3574.68 --> 3577.3399999999997
what

3578.16 --> 3581.45
holy [ __ ]

3582.25 --> 3589.39
okay weirdos but yeah relative density

3586.869 --> 3593.4100000000003
but this equilibrium causes the force

3589.39 --> 3595.1189999999997
it's provable and I can explain all the

3593.41 --> 3598.89
aberrations that have previously been

3595.119 --> 3601.6600000000003
mistaken for gravity and I don't have a

3598.89 --> 3604.17
direct cause as to what causes the

3601.66 --> 3608.2599999999998
relative density spectrum to divide as

3604.17 --> 3610.4500000000003
it does why the lower density go one way

3608.26 --> 3612.4
and the higher density in the other why

3610.45 --> 3616.359
that why the axis I have no direct

3612.4 --> 3616.69
explanation for this speculations about

3616.359 --> 3619.3199999999997
it

3616.69 --> 3623.65
but the thing is it's not relevant

3619.32 --> 3627.34
because it does work that's the funny

3623.65 --> 3631.57
thing about science when it works it

3627.34 --> 3634.599
works and at that point unless things

3631.57 --> 3637.3900000000003
radically change around I can't really

3634.599 --> 3639.88
take it away again especially if you've

3637.39 --> 3642.79
been very simple and not tying in some

3639.88 --> 3645.31
delusional [ __ ] theory that is

3642.79 --> 3647.38
unprovable just keeping it simple that's

3645.31 --> 3651.2799999999997
real science that's real permanent

3647.38 --> 3654.58
solutions and then whatever causes the

3651.28 --> 3657.369
relative density spectrum division oh

3654.58 --> 3659.71
yeah well people can be speculating in

3657.369 --> 3662.7400000000002
all directions for years to come if they

3659.71 --> 3667.48
like till it somehow becomes proven if

3662.74 --> 3673.6299999999997
ever but the relative density concept

3667.48 --> 3675.4900000000002
will stand probably permanently it's

3673.63 --> 3679.51
never gonna go away again because it's

3675.49 --> 3683.31
provable it's very easy very easy to

3679.51 --> 3683.3100000000004
empirically prove it's everywhere

3690.85 --> 3696.7599999999998
what are you talking about Sparrow music

3693.28 --> 3699.69
no I was specifically addressing typical

3696.76 --> 3707.23
baller behavior look he was basically

3699.69 --> 3710.08
acting just like rumpus or or don't

3707.23 --> 3712.6
threader but in my chat and I was kind

3710.08 --> 3715.0299999999997
of talking back to him as if he were in

3712.6 --> 3719.02
on the panel so sorry if you were

3715.03 --> 3724.5400000000004
offended by that but yeah everything I

3719.02 --> 3727.15
said stands absolutely and I don't

3724.54 --> 3729.5099999999998
credit people for being cognitive

3727.15 --> 3729.51
dissonance

3733.12 --> 3738.19
so if you refuse to recognize it then

3736.18 --> 3740.0499999999997
that's really your problem but I'm

3738.19 --> 3747.31
saying everything I do for a very good

3740.05 --> 3749.6400000000003
reason and if I hadn't then I would have

3747.31 --> 3754.11
apologized pretty quickly after that

3749.64 --> 3757.15
so anyway I'm gonna run out the show so

3754.11 --> 3758.9100000000003
thanks everyone for coming if you like

3757.15 --> 3761.53
to show please don't forget to upload it

3758.91 --> 3765.0099999999998
if you appreciated my little gravity

3761.53 --> 3766.57
rant there and if you haven't already

3765.01 --> 3768.07
subscribed to my channel and hit the

3766.57 --> 3769.84
bell notification so you know when I'm

3768.07 --> 3771.4
going live which is normally 2 p.m.

3769.84 --> 3773.29
after damn time every day

3771.4 --> 3775.5
please also do support my channel

3773.29 --> 3778.45
through the super chat paypal patreon

3775.5 --> 3781.36
and my GoFundMe that would be much

3778.45 --> 3785.2599999999998
appreciated I will be back tomorrow with

3781.36 --> 3789.19
flat earth early-bird number 307 hashtag

3785.26 --> 3790.48
meifa indeed Steve and ogre moco and I'm

3789.19 --> 3793.03
going to join the Flat Earth debates

3790.48 --> 3797.16
right after this I think so until the

3793.03 --> 3797.1600000000003
next time keep it flat

3797.28 --> 3827.32
