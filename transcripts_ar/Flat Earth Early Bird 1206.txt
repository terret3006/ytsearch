weather is

104.64 --> 107.04
gray

107.36 --> 112.56
very moist

109.6 --> 114.79899999999999
not super cold it's just really really

112.56 --> 117.84
moist

114.799 --> 121.36000000000001
went out for groceries earlier in this

117.84 --> 121.36
there's no rain but it's just

123.84 --> 127.159
it's moist

129.039 --> 131.28
so

134.16 --> 138.4
yeah

135.28 --> 140.959
now that moist i think it's like

138.4 --> 144.48000000000002
doing a job on

140.959 --> 144.48
my intestines because they just

147.84 --> 150.879
it's distracting

151.04 --> 155.67999999999998
right

152.72 --> 158.239
hello nathan oakley 1980 first in chat

pjcnet

161.36 --> 168.48000000000002
good to see you all

164.0 --> 170.0
it is tuesday the 5th of april 2012.

that 12

170.0 --> 174.2
22 is what

184.879 --> 190.159
i had a good rest

186.48 --> 190.159
did not go to bed too late

193.2 --> 198.39999999999998
and i feel a little tired but i think

195.519 --> 199.76
it's just because it's so moist

198.4 --> 202.08
what it is

199.76 --> 202.07999999999998
right

209.84 --> 213.799
so how are you all doing

214.56 --> 218.64000000000001
yesterday's letter of debate was pretty

216.4 --> 218.64000000000001
good

224.959 --> 228.48
although yeah people were kind of

226.64 --> 230.39999999999998
rumpussy a bit

228.48 --> 233.599
in the chat but it's very typical for a

230.4 --> 233.59900000000002
monday anyways uh

233.84 --> 241.239
also some ballers got in if i remember

236.48 --> 241.23899999999998
correctly did they nathan

247.2 --> 250.2
uh

260.799 --> 265.84
anyway jim bob had another great stream

263.28 --> 267.52
yesterday

265.84 --> 269.03999999999996
they're always great

267.52 --> 271.68
to sit

269.04 --> 273.199
sit through

271.68 --> 276.40000000000003
adam meek and joined me in the chat

273.199 --> 279.68
there as well that was kind of fun

276.4 --> 280.71999999999997
uh very flatter themed

279.68 --> 282.96
show

280.72 --> 285.44000000000005
jim bob talks a lot about flat earth and

282.96 --> 288.56
flat earth debate mechanics basically

285.44 --> 288.56
the things that we deal with

293.6 --> 298.0
didn't catch the show the other day

295.759 --> 299.759
which other day

298.0 --> 302.0
i mean yesterday i watched part of it

299.759 --> 302.0
back

302.24 --> 307.6
it was okay but it was not

305.68 --> 310.32
i can't really compare it to like my

307.6 --> 312.96000000000004
sunday show my sunday show was really

310.32 --> 312.96
really good

316.479 --> 322.56
right also yeah yesterday i called it my

319.84 --> 324.56
show black face conservative

322.56 --> 326.96
people were worried

324.56 --> 328.16
oh you'll get a strike or something nope

326.96 --> 330.63899999999995
nothing

328.16 --> 331.84000000000003
absolutely nothing

330.639 --> 334.16
i don't think

331.84 --> 338.71999999999997
at this point i think youtube like

334.16 --> 341.91900000000004
doesn't really care anymore what i do

338.72 --> 341.91900000000004
most of the time

342.08 --> 345.68
it's kind of funny i

343.52 --> 348.639
was listening to vox day yesterday also

345.68 --> 351.6
and he mentioned that

348.639 --> 353.759
he kind of has this yes because

351.6 --> 357.199
a lot of time people just don't really

353.759 --> 357.199
understand what he's talking about

357.44 --> 363.039
they kind of don't get

360.4 --> 365.039
they don't they leave him alone

363.039 --> 367.759
so i wonder if that's the case with me

365.039 --> 372.759
as well a bit

367.759 --> 372.759
oh talking fed all right flatter sage

393.44 --> 396.44
ugh

413.44 --> 417.919
man i hope this doesn't like keep

416.56 --> 420.639
i could

417.919 --> 423.84
i hope this like goes away quickly it's

420.639 --> 423.84000000000003
so distracting

425.919 --> 432.15999999999997
this is my my guts hurt a little

429.199 --> 432.16
it's not even like

432.24 --> 436.56
personal stress-based tension pain or

434.72 --> 439.709
anything it's just me

436.56 --> 439.709
[Music]

440.24 --> 444.56
like almost a feeling you're sick but

442.8 --> 446.16
not really

444.56 --> 448.24
i don't know

446.16 --> 451.84000000000003
annoying

448.24 --> 451.84000000000003
hope it goes away

470.8 --> 474.879
right also watched a bit of benjamin

476.319 --> 479.84000000000003
red pill rooster episode

483.52 --> 488.96
but yeah it's a huge show so i didn't

486.319 --> 488.96000000000004
watch it all

490.08 --> 493.08
uh

496.4 --> 502.12
so yeah i'm pretty much open

498.479 --> 502.12
to discuss anything

510.639 --> 516.399
i had a bit of i had a phone call with a

513.519 --> 516.399
social worker

517.599 --> 521.9190000000001
just about

518.839 --> 524.24
like the situation out here in the

521.919 --> 525.519
netherlands and like the inflation

524.24 --> 528.24
that's

525.519 --> 530.5600000000001
seem to be coming and

528.24 --> 532.399
and also like what's keeping the

530.56 --> 533.3599999999999
government in place

532.399 --> 535.6
right

533.36 --> 536.8000000000001
because

535.6 --> 538.9590000000001
people here in the netherlands are

536.8 --> 541.92
really fed up with this government like

538.959 --> 544.88
really fed up with it

541.92 --> 547.4399999999999
and it's kind of baffling how they can

544.88 --> 550.08
just keep going and they're putting the

547.44 --> 552.8800000000001
corona measures on ice

550.08 --> 555.839
even though like there is absolutely no

552.88 --> 560.399
viable reason for that to ever roll out

555.839 --> 560.399
ever again on any occasion

560.56 --> 564.0799999999999
right

561.839 --> 564.08
so

564.56 --> 568.3199999999999
it's a bit worrisome

566.24 --> 569.2
and i'm thinking about it

568.32 --> 572.0
like

569.2 --> 573.76
how how do we how do we get him up

572.0 --> 574.88
right

573.76 --> 577.12
and

574.88 --> 579.12
yeah social worker mentioned that part

577.12 --> 581.279
of the problem is that there's

579.12 --> 582.8
a whole range of police officers that

581.279 --> 585.68
are kind of just

582.8 --> 588.7199999999999
sticking with it for pure purely for

585.68 --> 588.7199999999999
financial reasons

589.44 --> 594.9590000000001
and that perhaps if they didn't

592.48 --> 595.47
anymore that the entire government would

594.959 --> 596.959
just be

595.47 --> 599.12
[Music]

596.959 --> 604.1999999999999
yeah removed quickly

599.12 --> 604.2
so yeah something to think about for me

605.2 --> 610.32
yeah craziness stuff five dollars per

607.6 --> 611.76
gallon gas yeah the fuel prices are like

610.32 --> 615.72
the most

611.76 --> 615.72
in your face right now

618.16 --> 622.88
especially in the united states

621.04 --> 625.8389999999999
and yeah of course in the united states

622.88 --> 627.4399999999999
it was always very low compared to other

625.839 --> 630.1600000000001
places

627.44 --> 633.36
gases of gas prices in the united states

630.16 --> 635.6
have always been much lower

633.36 --> 637.2
than like in the netherlands and europe

635.6 --> 640.16
because they don't

637.2 --> 641.84
put giant amount of taxes on it

640.16 --> 643.279
over there

641.84 --> 645.36
[Music]

643.279 --> 649.2
so yeah when it goes up it's a it's a

645.36 --> 649.2
huge difference for you guys

651.12 --> 657.399
anyway hello jeff gas head seeking star

654.399 --> 657.399
wars

663.34 --> 667.59
[Music]

665.12 --> 671.129
so

667.59 --> 671.129
[Music]

673.46 --> 676.529
[Music]

681.92 --> 687.76
world treaty that's that's messed up

685.12 --> 689.279
but like who's actually gonna buy into

687.76 --> 690.079
that

689.279 --> 692.16
right

690.079 --> 695.279
it's only

692.16 --> 697.519
like world economic forum politicians

695.279 --> 700.0
that are literally conspiring against

697.519 --> 702.0
the people

700.0 --> 703.92
to initiate such a treaty because

702.0 --> 707.04
there's no

703.92 --> 710.24
there's no citizens of any country

707.04 --> 713.76
that is going to want to sign up on on

710.24 --> 715.6800000000001
that there's not a single citizen

713.76 --> 716.639
that actually would like to sign up on

715.68 --> 721.399
that

716.639 --> 721.399
it's only corrupted politicians

732.56 --> 736.88
yeah jeff guy said yeah of course it's

734.56 --> 740.88
lower in the uk but

736.88 --> 743.36
uk is a lot smaller country right so

740.88 --> 745.76
higher gas price in the united states is

743.36 --> 747.519
much more impactful

745.76 --> 751.8389999999999
because it just makes makes certain

747.519 --> 754.32
logistical systems impossible

751.839 --> 756.399
in england and europe

754.32 --> 758.24
yeah it's not really that big of an

756.399 --> 762.0
issue because the distances are just

758.24 --> 764.0
much shorter per default

762.0 --> 765.04
in the united states however

764.0 --> 767.279
yeah

765.04 --> 772.04
to get anywhere you have to like travel

767.279 --> 772.04
vast distances every time so

777.76 --> 780.76
right

783.25 --> 786.419
[Music]

788.079 --> 793.8
i think it might finally be going away

790.8 --> 793.8
good

800.56 --> 804.16
[Music]

819.12 --> 823.68
right but yeah the issue is is not just

821.76 --> 827.6
gas prices that are really being

823.68 --> 830.8
affected by the situation right now

827.6 --> 830.8000000000001
it's also a certain

832.079 --> 837.12
food products

834.48 --> 837.12
like wheat

838.0 --> 841.92
or maybe that's more just europe that's

840.0 --> 843.92
being influenced by that because a lot

841.92 --> 844.88
of our wheat did actually come from

843.92 --> 847.199
russia

844.88 --> 848.8
and of course there's the the gas right

847.199 --> 853.4399999999999
it's not

848.8 --> 853.4399999999999
gasoline but actual natural gas

853.68 --> 856.68
so

857.519 --> 861.839
yeah still have to see like how

859.76 --> 864.0
everything's gonna unroll because it's

861.839 --> 866.24
gonna take its time it's not just gonna

864.0 --> 867.36
like immediately increase in prices and

866.24 --> 870.48
that's it

867.36 --> 872.639
it's like food prices typically slowly

870.48 --> 876.0790000000001
ramp up

872.639 --> 878.8
gas prices are much more of jumpers

876.079 --> 878.8
in general

883.46 --> 890.169
[Music]

901.92 --> 907.8389999999999
okay flatter state what do you mean when

903.839 --> 910.5600000000001
do you think they are gonna start back

907.839 --> 912.48
up the mandates you mean the corona

910.56 --> 915.279
measures

912.48 --> 915.279
it's all depends

915.839 --> 917.839
i mean

917.04 --> 920.7199999999999
the

917.839 --> 923.36
a moment they might try that is when

920.72 --> 926.8000000000001
just like another wave of sickness

923.36 --> 928.5600000000001
for any natural reason just breaks out

926.8 --> 930.4799999999999
like oh there's some really crazy

928.56 --> 932.6389999999999
weather and suddenly everybody gets the

930.48 --> 934.8000000000001
flu again right and then they'll just

932.639 --> 937.04
call it corona and lock everything down

934.8 --> 939.279
before anything has even been tested

937.04 --> 940.639
that's how i see it happening right

939.279 --> 941.759
there's always going to be waves of

940.639 --> 945.6
sickness

941.759 --> 947.1990000000001
it's natural that happens yearly

945.6 --> 948.5600000000001
so

947.199 --> 951.7589999999999
they'll just

948.56 --> 954.399
use such a moment as an excuse like oh

951.759 --> 957.04
more people are sick oh no immediately

954.399 --> 960.32
let's turn this into emergency

957.04 --> 960.3199999999999
for no bloody reason

960.8 --> 967.639
no good reason anyway

963.199 --> 967.639
so that's how we think they'll do it

970.56 --> 974.079
or

971.6 --> 976.639
or worse they might use it as a

974.079 --> 978.399
political punishing tool

976.639 --> 981.12
that could also

978.399 --> 983.519
come to pass

981.12 --> 985.44
where it's like they are

983.519 --> 987.68
at some point like

985.44 --> 990.8800000000001
getting voted out

987.68 --> 993.519
and then they'll instead of like oh

990.88 --> 995.4399999999999
a military or police emergency they'll

993.519 --> 997.04
just say oh oh

995.44 --> 998.399
the doctors suddenly say there's this

997.04 --> 999.8389999999999
disease we've got to lock everything

998.399 --> 1000.639
down right now

999.839 --> 1003.519
just

1000.639 --> 1006.48
without even there being a disease

1003.519 --> 1008.8
right without any situation just because

1006.48 --> 1010.88
they are threatening

1008.8 --> 1013.199
they are threatened

1010.88 --> 1015.92
in their position right so they might

1013.199 --> 1017.8389999999999
also roll out corona measures as purely

1015.92 --> 1019.279
as a political manipulation to in the

1017.839 --> 1020.9590000000001
moment

1019.279 --> 1022.0
they might just go that far you know

1020.959 --> 1025.4389999999999
it's

1022.0 --> 1027.839
yeah that is unheard of but in this age

1025.439 --> 1031.28
everything pretty much that's unheard of

1027.839 --> 1034.0
is becoming not so unheard of

1031.28 --> 1037.52
so if you're going to imagine what's

1034.0 --> 1040.319
like the most idiotic

1037.52 --> 1042.24
outrageous

1040.319 --> 1043.52
thing that could happen that they would

1042.24 --> 1045.76
do

1043.52 --> 1047.9189999999999
there's a good chance you're gonna see

1045.76 --> 1050.559
that happen in your lifetime pretty much

1047.919 --> 1051.6000000000001
whatever you cannot come up with

1050.559 --> 1053.76
yeah

1051.6 --> 1057.12
that unnerves me because i've come up

1053.76 --> 1057.12
with a whole bunch of things

1059.919 --> 1063.039
up to the point where

1061.6 --> 1065.039
in the united states where they're

1063.039 --> 1067.12
legalizing post-birth abortion that

1065.039 --> 1069.919
they're literally just going to murder

1067.12 --> 1071.9189999999999
babies on the street visibly for

1069.919 --> 1073.039
everybody

1071.919 --> 1075.039
that sort of

1073.039 --> 1078.4
[ __ ] up insanity right yeah that's

1075.039 --> 1078.4
totally idiotic right

1078.84 --> 1085.4399999999998
well just saying

1082.32 --> 1086.24
it is that kind of a time now

1085.44 --> 1089.3600000000001
so

1086.24 --> 1093.039
expect the worst imaginable when it

1089.36 --> 1096.24
comes to that when it comes to

1093.039 --> 1098.8799999999999
legalizing and normalizing absolutely

1096.24 --> 1101.28
demonic insane behavior

1098.88 --> 1102.72
right they're already well underway with

1101.28 --> 1104.799
that

1102.72 --> 1106.559
just realize there's really not a cap

1104.799 --> 1109.039
there not really

1106.559 --> 1110.799
i mean there needs to be

1109.039 --> 1113.679
there isn't

1110.799 --> 1113.679
unfortunately

1118.799 --> 1123.039
and of course like they don't say gay

1124.0 --> 1128.12
oh my god it's so lame

1141.52 --> 1148.16
since products jump in price hmm

1145.84 --> 1150.48
yeah well flatter say i saw several

1148.16 --> 1153.039
products jump slightly in price but that

1150.48 --> 1155.44
was even last year

1153.039 --> 1156.64
maybe it was an anticipation from the

1155.44 --> 1158.72
store owner

1156.64 --> 1160.4
or from the franchise owner

1158.72 --> 1162.72
they already knew this was coming so i

1160.4 --> 1162.72
already

1162.84 --> 1167.12
anticipated that happening

1167.28 --> 1170.96
there was already like a slight price

1169.28 --> 1174.0
increase in a whole range of products

1170.96 --> 1174.0
like 20 percent

1175.44 --> 1181.3600000000001
i noticed i significantly noticed that

1178.0 --> 1184.559
meat became more expensive

1181.36 --> 1187.559
like even cat food

1184.559 --> 1187.559
yeah

1191.7 --> 1199.71
[Music]

1204.64 --> 1211.1200000000001
that makes no sense though because

1206.88 --> 1211.1200000000001
that's what's the contamination risk

1211.36 --> 1215.12
it makes no sense george sanford

1217.28 --> 1220.52
a lockdown

1221.44 --> 1226.72
how does that apply to a disease that's

1224.0 --> 1229.76
only transferable

1226.72 --> 1232.96
as they say hiv is transferable it makes

1229.76 --> 1235.28
no sense whatsoever to do that at all

1232.96 --> 1237.3600000000001
i mean they might call out oh there's a

1235.28 --> 1238.48
nuke medical crisis because all these

1237.36 --> 1241.039
people

1238.48 --> 1242.96
have aids now yeah because they took

1241.039 --> 1243.919
vaccines yeah we know

1242.96 --> 1246.72
right

1243.919 --> 1249.44
but that would be just like a burden on

1246.72 --> 1252.159
the populace and industry

1249.44 --> 1255.76
not a reason to start locking down there

1252.159 --> 1258.0800000000002
has like no relation to that whatsoever

1255.76 --> 1259.36
even in their presuppositional medical

1258.08 --> 1263.039
models

1259.36 --> 1266.4499999999998
so i disagree george sanford

1263.039 --> 1268.799
that train of thinking makes no sense

1266.45 --> 1270.64
[Music]

1268.799 --> 1274.36
although they'll screw us over some

1270.64 --> 1274.3600000000001
other way of course

1277.039 --> 1279.679
or

1278.0 --> 1282.08
i mean i think there's a great

1279.679 --> 1284.24
likelihood that

1282.08 --> 1286.24
like medical insurances are probably

1284.24 --> 1289.1200000000001
going to go ballistic here and

1286.24 --> 1289.1200000000001
everywhere else

1289.36 --> 1293.28
because yeah

1290.799 --> 1295.76
they're the ones that actually

1293.28 --> 1297.76
have to fund the the medical things and

1295.76 --> 1299.36
if certainly all these people all get

1297.76 --> 1301.28
vades

1299.36 --> 1303.6789999999999
they're screwed

1301.28 --> 1306.559
so they are gonna up the prices also

1303.679 --> 1306.5590000000002
very likely

1307.28 --> 1311.36
or maybe it's just gonna run into a dead

1309.84 --> 1313.76
ditch

1311.36 --> 1316.1589999999999
and like it's gonna have they're gonna

1313.76 --> 1318.4
have to reform the entire medical

1316.159 --> 1320.96
insurance system here

1318.4 --> 1325.72
because it's mandatory

1320.96 --> 1325.72
you have to be medically insured

1343.6 --> 1349.039
what bottled water has gone up in price

1346.24 --> 1351.1200000000001
that's preposterous

1349.039 --> 1353.679
especially in the uk

1351.12 --> 1353.6789999999999
like what

1355.2 --> 1362.64
of all places the price of water is

1358.0 --> 1366.039
going up in the uk okay then

1362.64 --> 1366.039
that's stupid

1377.95 --> 1383.159
[Music]

1380.159 --> 1383.159
hmm

1386.75 --> 1393.7
[Music]

1401.84 --> 1406.1999999999998
hey adam price good to see you

1412.44 --> 1416.98
[Music]

1427.919 --> 1431.3600000000001
right now

1429.44 --> 1433.76
i was thinking again

1431.36 --> 1435.4399999999998
a good reason to do the lockdown well if

1433.76 --> 1437.44
something happened

1435.44 --> 1440.4
right

1437.44 --> 1442.799
remember there are health labs in the

1440.4 --> 1444.799
ukraine

1442.799 --> 1447.36
and if russia takes them

1444.799 --> 1449.6
then they might use it as bio weapons

1447.36 --> 1451.1999999999998
yeah they will use the health lab

1449.6 --> 1452.799
research

1451.2 --> 1456.0800000000002
health lab

1452.799 --> 1458.32
as bio weapons hmm must be

1456.08 --> 1460.799
some kind of dangerous health

1458.32 --> 1462.72
experiments they're performing at these

1460.799 --> 1464.0
health labs

1462.72 --> 1466.64
right

1464.0 --> 1468.64
so if something would happen like that

1466.64 --> 1472.159
like who knows maybe some

1468.64 --> 1474.3200000000002
weird pathogen is released

1472.159 --> 1477.279
and some people get a really freaky

1474.32 --> 1479.76
disease from it and maybe even die

1477.279 --> 1481.679
that might be a reason

1479.76 --> 1484.4
for suddenly all the places like oh my

1481.679 --> 1488.799
god there's a virus

1484.4 --> 1491.279
from ukraine and russia released it and

1488.799 --> 1493.9189999999999
it's airborne and now we have to lock

1491.279 --> 1497.279
everybody down to hope it won't catch on

1493.919 --> 1497.279
right that would be sort of

1498.159 --> 1502.72
an excuse that would work with the model

1500.4 --> 1502.72
of it

1502.88 --> 1506.159
it's still [ __ ]

1504.72 --> 1507.6000000000001
but

1506.159 --> 1510.7990000000002
that would be

1507.6 --> 1510.799
a worthy excuse

1512.4 --> 1516.48
the outbreak of a non non-contaminated

1515.76 --> 1519.36
uh

1516.48 --> 1519.3600000000001
yeah i would say

1520.64 --> 1524.96
non-spreading

1522.279 --> 1528.919
non-contaminant disease that's not a

1524.96 --> 1528.919
good reason to do it

1529.12 --> 1532.12
anyway

1552.48 --> 1557.84
sure there wasn't an april fools joke

1571.279 --> 1573.6
hmm

1580.4 --> 1586.159
yes seeking star water and they're

1583.2 --> 1588.64
heavily invested in too i mean i'm i'm

1586.159 --> 1591.6000000000001
fairly certain that these bio labs are

1588.64 --> 1591.6000000000001
being used

1593.679 --> 1599.039
basically to do research

1596.48 --> 1601.279
on how to create

1599.039 --> 1602.8799999999999
race specific bio weapons against

1601.279 --> 1604.64
russians

1602.88 --> 1606.5590000000002
i'm fairly certain that that's what

1604.64 --> 1609.279
they're spending their

1606.559 --> 1612.6
their time on or have been in the last

1609.279 --> 1612.6
eight years

but effectively it has

1690.559 --> 1696.72
yes i know pjc net that was my point too

1694.84 --> 1700.08
like

1696.72 --> 1701.44
the setup is there for the suggestion

1700.08 --> 1704.1589999999999
right

1701.44 --> 1705.679
i don't think like diseases work like

1704.159 --> 1708.96
that at all

1705.679 --> 1711.279
like ever that they never ever work like

1708.96 --> 1715.76
that

1711.279 --> 1715.76
i don't even think it's like infectious

1717.36 --> 1722.399
like at all

1719.279 --> 1724.72
i'm completely wiping the entire

1722.399 --> 1727.9189999999999
conceptual approach of the

1724.72 --> 1731.679
allopathic medical system

1727.919 --> 1732.5200000000002
of diseases related to flu i am wiping

1731.679 --> 1736.72
them

1732.52 --> 1737.679
completely off the table like the entire

1736.72 --> 1740.48
model

1737.679 --> 1742.72
and like probably the millions of pages

1740.48 --> 1745.84
of [ __ ] that are associated with it

1742.72 --> 1749.2
in its research i'm wiping it off the

1745.84 --> 1750.399
table in the trash can

1749.2 --> 1753.44
so

1750.399 --> 1756.8799999999999
oh no the disease broke out

1753.44 --> 1756.88
i'm not gonna be afraid

1758.96 --> 1763.6000000000001
i only think there's a reason to fear

1760.96 --> 1766.559
any of that if you're literally in the

1763.6 --> 1769.1999999999998
middle of it in between the people

1766.559 --> 1772.32
why well not because you could catch it

1769.2 --> 1775.3600000000001
but because it could trigger you

1772.32 --> 1778.08
to do yeah to it yeah to become sick

1775.36 --> 1778.08
like that too

1778.24 --> 1782.64
because i don't think it's contagious at

1780.24 --> 1785.44
all like at all

1782.64 --> 1785.44
absolutely

1792.84 --> 1798.799
not like in that sense even the very

1796.08 --> 1802.0
concept of contagion

1798.799 --> 1802.0
is already dubious

1804.72 --> 1808.96
right toxicity

1806.48 --> 1814.32
poisoning yeah

1808.96 --> 1814.32
contagion a pathogen spreading

1814.48 --> 1819.039
making people sick and then spreading it

1816.72 --> 1820.08
around through them no

1819.039 --> 1823.2
i'd

1820.08 --> 1826.0
completely wipe that off the table into

1823.2 --> 1826.0
the trash can

1827.12 --> 1830.6399999999999
there are deadly bacteria though yeah

1828.799 --> 1832.1589999999999
but why are they deadly

1830.64 --> 1834.3200000000002
you know

1832.159 --> 1836.3990000000001
aren't they just effectively weaponized

1834.32 --> 1838.799
by their direct surroundings

1836.399 --> 1841.12
and then temporarily they can be

1838.799 --> 1842.72
extremely aggressive

1841.12 --> 1845.84
but

1842.72 --> 1847.84
that goes away

1845.84 --> 1849.9189999999999
it goes away

1847.84 --> 1851.9189999999999
they stop being aggressive as soon as

1849.919 --> 1853.76
they basically integrate with the living

1851.919 --> 1854.8400000000001
body

1853.76 --> 1857.919
they

1854.84 --> 1860.24
de-weaponize right all this

1857.919 --> 1862.24
deadly bacteria that's weaponized

1860.24 --> 1864.48
they're literally bacteria that are put

1862.24 --> 1868.72
in highly toxic environments so that

1864.48 --> 1868.72
they kind of like adapt to it

1870.64 --> 1875.6000000000001
but they unadapt

1873.919 --> 1879.8400000000001
as soon as they just

1875.6 --> 1879.84
integrate with the living host

1882.24 --> 1886.0
so it's more like you're being poisoned

1885.039 --> 1888.24
then

1886.0 --> 1889.6
from the toxic influences that these

1888.24 --> 1892.48
bacteria

1889.6 --> 1895.84
carry and have adapted to

1892.48 --> 1898.08
but they unpoison

1895.84 --> 1900.6399999999999
they just adapt back

1898.08 --> 1902.1589999999999
rather quickly

1900.64 --> 1904.159
of course you could still like get

1902.159 --> 1906.88
killed from the initial

1904.159 --> 1910.5590000000002
introduction of it if they're still in

1906.88 --> 1913.3600000000001
the highly weaponized form but

1910.559 --> 1914.48
they don't stay like that and that's

1913.36 --> 1918.32
even

1914.48 --> 1920.559
in their model it's even admitted okay

1918.32 --> 1925.72
it makes no sense

1920.559 --> 1925.72
none of it what they do makes sense

1928.75 --> 1931.869
[Music]

1935.6 --> 1937.9189999999999
hmm

1938.88 --> 1944.3990000000001
allergies are a mystery well not not

1941.84 --> 1946.48
completely i mean allergies are are

1944.399 --> 1949.84
rather defined

1946.48 --> 1949.84
and they're real

1954.88 --> 1960.0800000000002
but yeah they have to do with like

1957.519 --> 1962.48
allergies are effectively an over

1960.08 --> 1965.1999999999998
response so it's like an

1962.48 --> 1967.84
exaggerated response to a toxic

1965.2 --> 1967.8400000000001
influence

1970.32 --> 1974.559
right but it's always relating to

1973.12 --> 1977.4399999999998
just

1974.559 --> 1979.84
toxic influences

1977.44 --> 1982.159
right and your body can handle certain

1979.84 --> 1984.24
degrees of toxic influences

1982.159 --> 1985.8400000000001
you have to process that

1984.24 --> 1988.559
and then if you have an allergy then

1985.84 --> 1992.559
suddenly that mechanism to basically

1988.559 --> 1994.799
process it becomes out of whack

1992.559 --> 1996.72
and it's like the same substance is

1994.799 --> 1998.08
suddenly treated like it's much more

1996.72 --> 1999.84
severe

1998.08 --> 2004.76
like a much more dangerous substance so

1999.84 --> 2004.76
it is an overreaction basically

2005.12 --> 2009.5189999999998
now how does that happen

2007.519 --> 2013.36
yeah that's the weirder part because you

2009.519 --> 2018.679
can get allergies you can get allergies

2013.36 --> 2018.6789999999999
from vaccination poison for example

2026.0 --> 2031.36
or you can get allergies from being in a

2029.12 --> 2035.6789999999999
too sterile and a

2031.36 --> 2036.799
and yeah in a two-sterile environment

2035.679 --> 2039.3600000000001
like

2036.799 --> 2041.84
people that have grown up in like houses

2039.36 --> 2045.32
urban houses that are like

2041.84 --> 2045.32
like rigorously

2046.159 --> 2051.839
cleaned from dust

2048.399 --> 2054.24
they might get dust allergies

2051.839 --> 2057.359
because they never

2054.24 --> 2059.52
learned to deal with it they're on a

2057.359 --> 2060.879
on a micro level their body never

2059.52 --> 2064.44
learned to deal with it and then you

2060.879 --> 2064.44
develop an allergy

2082.399 --> 2088.0
okay

2083.359 --> 2088.489
to watch your red tide bacteria hmm

right so you've been eating all those

2099.76 --> 2102.7200000000003
oysters

2101.68 --> 2105.04
well

2102.72 --> 2107.4399999999996
consider that it might not actually be

2105.04 --> 2109.52
the oysters themselves you're allergic

2107.44 --> 2110.2400000000002
for

2109.52 --> 2112.24
but

2110.24 --> 2114.9599999999996
it triggers it because it's directly

2112.24 --> 2118.56
associated with certain type of toxins

2114.96 --> 2120.96
that oysters gather they filter it out

2118.56 --> 2123.2
of the sea and then they

2120.96 --> 2125.359
have that right

2123.2 --> 2127.359
and if you then eat a lot of it yeah you

2125.359 --> 2130.0
might become like overburdened and your

2127.359 --> 2132.16
body is like okay don't eat oysters

2130.0 --> 2134.88
anymore

you've already had your limit

2134.88 --> 2142.1600000000003
of this poison that they seem to have

2142.16 --> 2146.96

from the vaccines probably right

2246.24 --> 2252.359
they were all these anthrax vaccines and

2248.48 --> 2252.359
they were a giant disaster

2258.24 --> 2263.4399999999996
yeah anthrax is like an example of a

2260.96 --> 2265.52
highly weaponized

2263.44 --> 2268.56
type of bacteria where they're just

2265.52 --> 2268.56
super toxic

2268.839 --> 2275.92
right but i bet that if you have anthrax

2272.079 --> 2275.92
and you just kind of like leave it

2276.72 --> 2281.359
to adapt to more

2279.119 --> 2284.079

2281.359 --> 2286.72

it's nothing you can do nothing you

3258.72 --> 3261.2
should do

3261.52 --> 3268.64
let them die

3265.119 --> 3268.6400000000003
their parents are going to kill them

3269.2 --> 3272.8799999999997
well

3270.16 --> 3277.319
what do you want to do kidnap them

3272.88 --> 3277.319
you know it's not going to work

3292.48 --> 3294.96
right

3293.57 --> 3297.6800000000003
[Music]

3294.96 --> 3299.76
i mean those kids are going to be [ __ ]

3297.68 --> 3300.96
for life no matter what even if they

3299.76 --> 3302.6400000000003
survive

3300.96 --> 3304.64
right because they had those [ __ ] up

3302.64 --> 3306.24
parents

3304.64 --> 3309.359
that are going to be a burden to them

3306.24 --> 3309.359
their entire life

3311.359 --> 3315.359
even if they manage to somehow maintain

3314.48 --> 3317.68
their

3315.359 --> 3318.48
child-like sanity

3317.68 --> 3320.72
like

3318.48 --> 3322.559
remain there to retain their purity in

3320.72 --> 3323.4399999999996
the face of all that they're still going

3322.559 --> 3325.52
to be

3323.44 --> 3327.04
just burdened by their parents the rest

3325.52 --> 3329.92
of their life because their parents are

3327.04 --> 3329.92
[ __ ] insane

3331.52 --> 3336.64
so yeah just

3333.68 --> 3336.64
hope for the best

3338.88 --> 3342.2400000000002
you just take care of you

3346.559 --> 3351.2400000000002
and your own and your children right

3371.52 --> 3376.24
hmm

3372.48 --> 3379.2
yeah that sucks jess palmer

3376.24 --> 3379.2
i'm sorry for you

3381.2 --> 3385.5589999999997
did you get off it though

3391.68 --> 3397.5989999999997
i mean if you literally grow up with

3393.52 --> 3401.119
ritalin then you're kind of screwed

3397.599 --> 3404.96
if you have it for a while then yeah

3401.119 --> 3410.2400000000002
it can still grow out of it

3404.96 --> 3413.04
i'm i'm feel very lucky that i had adhd

3410.24 --> 3415.2
moderate amount not extreme that it was

3413.04 --> 3415.2
like

3415.28 --> 3420.7200000000003
not super hyperactive but enough that it

3418.319 --> 3423.839
was kind of disruptive at times

3420.72 --> 3425.4399999999996
my parents were adamantly and so was i

3423.839 --> 3428.88
like no no

3425.44 --> 3430.2400000000002
no drugs this is normal this is actually

3428.88 --> 3431.92
natural

3430.24 --> 3433.7599999999998
right i'm so happy that my parents did

3431.92 --> 3436.16
that that they just recognized like you

3433.76 --> 3439.5200000000004
know your state of mind

3436.16 --> 3441.52
that's normal that's not abnormal that's

3439.52 --> 3443.119
the normal state of mind if you're a

3441.52 --> 3444.839
person like that

3443.119 --> 3449.119
it has a

3444.839 --> 3449.119
function it is effective

3449.839 --> 3454.4
people that are hyperactive when they're

3451.92 --> 3457.92
properly guided can turn into like

3454.4 --> 3460.799
miraculous problem solvers

3457.92 --> 3463.2000000000003
that out of nowhere just magically bring

3460.799 --> 3465.28
forth solutions

3463.2 --> 3467.839
it is a company typically with

3465.28 --> 3470.799
hyperactivism

3467.839 --> 3473.2799999999997
unless those hyperactive people are just

3470.799 --> 3475.52
really [ __ ] distracted by everything

3473.28 --> 3476.96
and they can't focus

3475.52 --> 3480.4
like at all

3476.96 --> 3483.359
right and yeah taking ritalin to force

3480.4 --> 3486.079
that focus doesn't help you develop the

3483.359 --> 3489.839
focus skills naturally that you need in

3486.079 --> 3489.8390000000004
order to control adhd

3490.559 --> 3495.659
right

3492.5 --> 3495.659
[Music]

3497.2 --> 3500.64
yes

3498.48 --> 3503.2
yeah that sucks i can't believe your dad

3500.64 --> 3505.68
still kept you on that [ __ ] then

3503.2 --> 3509.96
like i come on you

3505.68 --> 3509.96
how could you do that to your kid

3540.24 --> 3547.1189999999997
right yeah well territories look the

3542.319 --> 3549.04
whole adhd [ __ ] and ritalin

3547.119 --> 3550.6400000000003
it was kind of like a

3549.04 --> 3554.16
three-way

3550.64 --> 3557.44
situation on the one hand like why did

3554.16 --> 3559.04
the adhd people

3557.44 --> 3561.2000000000003
they were problem people in a way

3559.04 --> 3562.96
because they are

3561.2 --> 3565.1189999999997
disruptive

3562.96 --> 3566.7200000000003
they're always gonna like make noise

3565.119 --> 3568.7200000000003
speak out

3566.72 --> 3571.5989999999997
change the train of thought that

3568.72 --> 3573.1189999999997
everybody's engaging with

3571.599 --> 3575.28
so in school

3573.119 --> 3577.76
yeah adhd people especially if they're

3575.28 --> 3580.3190000000004
not properly trained to be like super

3577.76 --> 3582.48
strict with themselves

3580.319 --> 3584.64
and take

3582.48 --> 3586.48
things very seriously with respect and

3584.64 --> 3588.0
not let their emotions get involved too

3586.48 --> 3589.76
much if they're not trained in that yeah

3588.0 --> 3591.68
they're going to be very disruptive so

3589.76 --> 3593.5200000000004
there was just a recognizer like oh this

3591.68 --> 3595.9199999999996
disruptive kids

3593.52 --> 3598.88
and then the doctors came in like oh

3595.92 --> 3600.96
we could truck them that solves the

3598.88 --> 3603.6800000000003
issue

3600.96 --> 3605.359
for the rest of the people not the adhd

3603.68 --> 3607.9199999999996
people

3605.359 --> 3610.16
and that's what they did so yeah medical

3607.92 --> 3611.28
industry or pharmaceutical industry made

3610.16 --> 3614.68
a profit

3611.28 --> 3614.6800000000003
drug dealing

3615.68 --> 3620.3999999999996
people in the system no longer really

3618.16 --> 3622.5589999999997
had to deal with super hyperactive

3620.4 --> 3624.7200000000003
people

3622.559 --> 3626.7200000000003
which gave a lot of people a headache

3624.72 --> 3628.8799999999997
it's what they do it's what i do

3626.72 --> 3630.72
sometimes

3628.88 --> 3634.079
right

3630.72 --> 3636.799
so that's how that unrolled

3634.079 --> 3639.28
it was a win-win situation but the adhd

3636.799 --> 3642.48
people themselves were the loser so it

3639.28 --> 3644.4
was not just a full win there was a

3642.48 --> 3646.88
loser in it as well

3644.4 --> 3650.88
and they downplayed it like adhd people

3646.88 --> 3653.04
have been downplayed in society as in

3650.88 --> 3655.44
they're just it's a disorder they're

3653.04 --> 3659.359
just disruptive

3655.44 --> 3663.04
not understanding that adhd people often

3659.359 --> 3665.5989999999997
have like really high range talents that

3663.04 --> 3668.4
come with the adhd with the

3665.599 --> 3671.119
hyperactivism

3668.4 --> 3672.96
let's just ignored neglected

3671.119 --> 3674.4
terrible

3672.96 --> 3676.559
i mean

3674.4 --> 3680.48
if you really think about it carefully

3676.559 --> 3682.4
adhd people should have special focused

3680.48 --> 3685.76
schools for them

3682.4 --> 3687.44
that are dedicated to dealing with that

3685.76 --> 3688.96
with the typical issues that come with

3687.44 --> 3691.28
them and

3688.96 --> 3693.04
provide them with sufficiently

3691.28 --> 3694.88
stimulating

3693.04 --> 3696.88
material

3694.88 --> 3700.4
so they don't actually get bored which

3696.88 --> 3702.0
is usually the problem

3700.4 --> 3704.64
right and then if you're surrounded by

3702.0 --> 3706.16
others then you can kind of see what you

3704.64 --> 3708.319
have more right because one of the

3706.16 --> 3709.52
things adhd what i had

3708.319 --> 3712.799
is

3709.52 --> 3714.0
i didn't realize that i was like that

3712.799 --> 3716.24
because

3714.0 --> 3718.72
i was the only one like in my class that

3716.24 --> 3721.7599999999998
was kind of like that

3718.72 --> 3721.7599999999998
and you don't see it

3722.96 --> 3727.52
and it's not like there were like mobile

3725.119 --> 3730.7200000000003
phones and cameras and videos everywhere

3727.52 --> 3732.24
when i grew up and went to school

3730.72 --> 3734.3999999999996
because then maybe somebody would have

3732.24 --> 3736.16
filmed me and showed me like dude do you

3734.4 --> 3738.64
realize this is what you're like i would

3736.16 --> 3741.2
have been shocked if i had seen that

3738.64 --> 3743.68
but it wasn't that time yet now would be

3741.2 --> 3745.2
that time now people could do that when

3743.68 --> 3747.7599999999998
i was at school

3745.2 --> 3747.7599999999998
it wasn't

3749.839 --> 3754.88
the only real screen she got to see was

3752.319 --> 3757.68
like television in vhs

3754.88 --> 3757.6800000000003
right that's it

3765.2 --> 3769.0389999999998
u.s made us feel like we were insane

3767.039 --> 3771.5200000000004
right

3769.039 --> 3771.5200000000004
terrible

3773.92 --> 3779.6800000000003
this the effective destruction of future

3776.4 --> 3779.6800000000003
geniuses i mean

3780.0 --> 3786.0
most people that have adhd that i've met

3783.839 --> 3789.599
are really smart

3786.0 --> 3789.599
spiritual strong people

3790.4 --> 3795.599
almost all of them it's like i recognize

3792.48 --> 3796.64
it's almost like you have more spirit in

3795.599 --> 3799.599
a way

3796.64 --> 3803.2799999999997
so it's more compact and then you

3799.599 --> 3807.079
like function on another level

3803.28 --> 3807.079
it's just more spirit

3812.24 --> 3815.2799999999997
and

3813.599 --> 3816.799
what they should have done

3815.28 --> 3818.7200000000003
again is

3816.799 --> 3821.839
accommodate for that

3818.72 --> 3824.24
and like try to raise them into the

3821.839 --> 3826.88
potential

3824.24 --> 3828.72
high value assets for society that they

3826.88 --> 3831.52
could have become

3828.72 --> 3834.5589999999997
but no they had to like oh

3831.52 --> 3836.72
everybody's the same you're out of you

3834.559 --> 3840.4
yeah you're outside of that norm so

3836.72 --> 3841.9199999999996
you're a deviant you're just in the way

3840.4 --> 3845.2400000000002
it's the worst thing they could have

3841.92 --> 3845.2400000000002
ever done

3851.68 --> 3856.439
[Music]

3859.17 --> 3862.239
[Music]

3872.24 --> 3876.0789999999997
and they say people have

3874.16 --> 3878.319
who appear to have mental neurological

3876.079 --> 3880.319
disorders are closer to truth

3878.319 --> 3882.799
well why you know what is the

3880.319 --> 3884.319
neurological mental disorder

3882.799 --> 3886.64
it's

3884.319 --> 3889.52
usually

3886.64 --> 3890.48
lack of functioning due to a stress

3889.52 --> 3893.359
right

3890.48 --> 3895.68
because what what is what makes adhd

3893.359 --> 3898.16
people even kind of

3895.68 --> 3900.72
disruptive it's their stress the stress

3898.16 --> 3902.8799999999997
they deal with why do you have stress

3900.72 --> 3904.8799999999997
because

3902.88 --> 3906.48
you're aware

3904.88 --> 3907.359
and you might not be able to deal with

3906.48 --> 3910.64
that

3907.359 --> 3913.68
right awareness oversight

3910.64 --> 3916.96
the punishment the burden of knowing the

3913.68 --> 3920.0789999999997
burden of responsibility that comes with

3916.96 --> 3920.079
actual insight

3921.68 --> 3925.44
so yeah in a sense

3924.0 --> 3927.28
people that do

3925.44 --> 3928.96
typically have

3927.28 --> 3932.079
some

3928.96 --> 3932.079
mental suffering

3932.72 --> 3936.72
right

3934.319 --> 3939.52
it's probably because

3936.72 --> 3942.0
they know things they can't handle

3939.52 --> 3943.839
and for some it can like completely

3942.0 --> 3946.4
flip-flop them where they're basically

3943.839 --> 3948.4
surrendering to satan

3946.4 --> 3949.839
because they don't know like they're

3948.4 --> 3951.9500000000003
like it's out of their hands and they're

3949.839 --> 3954.319
like yeah [ __ ] you all i'm just gonna

3951.95 --> 3956.0789999999997
[Music]

3954.319 --> 3958.48
because [ __ ] this world i can't deal

3956.079 --> 3958.48
with this

3959.359 --> 3962.72
right that can happen too

3963.599 --> 3970.96
seen plenty of adhd people that are

3967.28 --> 3970.96
satan surrenderist as well

3972.48 --> 3976.88
but it's just weakness that they do that

3977.76 --> 3982.48
and unless they grow out of that they

3979.92 --> 3983.359
usually end up dying

3982.48 --> 3985.599
because

3983.359 --> 3988.48
adhd

3985.599 --> 3992.34
and like satanism real darkness [ __ ]

3988.48 --> 3997.119
that's really terrible combination

3992.34 --> 3998.799
[Music]

3997.119 --> 4000.88
it's anything with satanism is a

3998.799 --> 4002.88
terrible combination but with somebody

4000.88 --> 4006.52
spirited

4002.88 --> 4006.52
it's even worse

4021.92 --> 4026.96
thought of as bad a better understanding

4024.72 --> 4029.52
now i certainly hope so logical

4026.96 --> 4029.52
conclusion

4029.839 --> 4035.68
in the 70s people were kind of [ __ ]

4032.64 --> 4037.68
then to think like

4035.68 --> 4040.0789999999997
bad kids why

4037.68 --> 4042.319
because they don't do what we say

4040.079 --> 4044.88
why don't they do what they you say

4042.319 --> 4047.68
maybe because you suck you don't have

4044.88 --> 4050.319
natural authority you're boring you're

4047.68 --> 4052.24
wrong all the time and the kid sees it

4050.319 --> 4053.52
and doesn't respect your authority so

4052.24 --> 4056.319
he's actually

4053.52 --> 4059.0389999999998
taking up responsibility with god and

4056.319 --> 4060.5589999999997
rebelling against you as a spirit to

4059.039 --> 4063.559
another

4060.559 --> 4063.559
yeah

4073.52 --> 4078.079
you know that i kind of did that sort of

4075.44 --> 4080.079
thing like even to my teachers when i

4078.079 --> 4082.4
was younger

4080.079 --> 4084.079
it's just it's the it's your duty when

4082.4 --> 4086.64
you're like that you have to do that

4084.079 --> 4089.3590000000004
it's normal

4086.64 --> 4092.8799999999997
like if a teacher is wrong and they're

4089.359 --> 4096.239
letting being misguided by their ego

4092.88 --> 4098.319
you have to punish them you have to make

4096.239 --> 4100.4
them feel it

4098.319 --> 4102.319
and then if they actually overcome it

4100.4 --> 4105.839
and they correct them that's when you

4102.319 --> 4105.839000000001
reward them

4106.319 --> 4109.4400000000005
that's how you do it

4112.319 --> 4115.92
but they have to actually overcome they

4114.319 --> 4118.96
have to actually have a personal

4115.92 --> 4120.4
spiritual insight moment where they like

4118.96 --> 4124.719
damn i i

4120.4 --> 4124.719
i've been on the wrong track this is why

4126.64 --> 4130.839
and i've had those types of moments with

4129.04 --> 4133.5199999999995
teachers it's like

4130.839 --> 4135.839
glorious it is glorious when that

4133.52 --> 4137.679
happens

4135.839 --> 4141.6
but yeah if you're in a school where

4137.679 --> 4144.799
it's like no the teacher is always right

4141.6 --> 4147.52
you must adapt to such

4144.799 --> 4149.359
things that are just based on hierarchy

4147.52 --> 4151.52
not on truth

4149.359 --> 4155.1990000000005
that doesn't really work very well with

4151.52 --> 4155.1990000000005
adhd people this is

4155.44 --> 4160.04
like they have to actually be right

4160.719 --> 4165.52
if they're just not right then you as an

4163.04 --> 4167.839
adhd kid you can't

4165.52 --> 4170.159000000001
adapt to that it's like that'll drive

4167.839 --> 4173.12
you insane

4170.159 --> 4174.719
like actually insane

4173.12 --> 4176.799
you can't adapt

4174.719 --> 4179.12
to wrong

4176.799 --> 4182.239
when you're like that

4179.12 --> 4185.239
cocking does not come natural to adhd

4182.239 --> 4185.239
people

4192.4 --> 4196.32
hmm

4193.52 --> 4196.320000000001
that's cool yes

4200.84 --> 4206.64
palmer right question everything

4204.88 --> 4209.52
also tell them

4206.64 --> 4211.1990000000005
also not just question everything also

4209.52 --> 4212.2390000000005
listen carefully

4211.199 --> 4213.759999999999
right

4212.239 --> 4215.5199999999995
you're just going to question everything

4213.76 --> 4216.64
you might end up as a scatter gunning

4215.52 --> 4217.92
baller

4216.64 --> 4220.88
right

4217.92 --> 4224.4800000000005
question everything but also listen to

4220.88 --> 4224.4800000000005
the answers pay attention

4225.44 --> 4230.719
and at some stage if they have the

4226.88 --> 4232.56
talent form like make them aware

4230.719 --> 4234.88
they have to listen to the answer but

4232.56 --> 4236.64
they also have to look inside of the

4234.88 --> 4239.6
person through their eyes and through

4236.64 --> 4242.56
how they know how they act

4239.6 --> 4245.280000000001
whether they're holding something back

4242.56 --> 4248.159000000001
right the subtleties of

4245.28 --> 4250.08
non-verbal communication and just what's

4248.159 --> 4252.0
really happening in people's heads you

4250.08 --> 4255.28
have the direct communication and you

4252.0 --> 4255.28
have the internal world

4256.32 --> 4260.48
it's very good to make your kid aware of

4258.64 --> 4263.679
that at a young age because then they

4260.48 --> 4265.839999999999
can really grow into that system which

4263.679 --> 4268.2390000000005
will be very useful for them in the

4265.84 --> 4268.2390000000005
future

4271.28 --> 4276.32
right listen but not just listen with

4273.6 --> 4279.04
your ears also listen with your eyes and

4276.32 --> 4283.639999999999
listen with your spirit and your moral

4279.04 --> 4283.64
sense listen with every part of you

4284.47 --> 4287.509
[Music]

4288.719 --> 4290.6
right

4289.6 --> 4293.77
anyway

4290.6 --> 4293.77
[Music]

4309.679 --> 4314.4
right listen to hear not

4311.679 --> 4316.0
yeah yeah

4314.4 --> 4318.799999999999
right that's a tough one though seeking

4316.0 --> 4320.239
stuff if you're really into a debate in

4318.8 --> 4322.159000000001
a subject

4320.239 --> 4324.879999999999
it's really tough to

4322.159 --> 4326.799999999999
become aware even of that you're just

4324.88 --> 4329.12
waiting for somebody you're like

4326.8 --> 4331.360000000001
listening careful to size up when

4329.12 --> 4334.08
they're gonna finish up

4331.36 --> 4335.839999999999
so that you can then enroll what you

4334.08 --> 4337.5199999999995
wanted to say but effectively when you

4335.84 --> 4338.64
do that you don't listen to what they're

4337.52 --> 4340.719
saying

4338.64 --> 4343.679
you're already assuming to know what

4340.719 --> 4346.32
they're saying which sometimes is right

4343.679 --> 4350.4
sometimes it's not

4346.32 --> 4352.639999999999
but if you don't listen then you yeah

4350.4 --> 4354.4
don't listen just

4352.64 --> 4357.04
to hear when somebody's gonna stop

4354.4 --> 4359.04
speaking so you can talk actually pay

4357.04 --> 4362.4
attention to what they're talking about

4359.04 --> 4364.64
also it's good to learn to trust

4362.4 --> 4364.639999999999
that

4366.48 --> 4370.4
you don't have to necessarily even if

4369.04 --> 4374.159
you have an idea

4370.4 --> 4376.32
get it out trust that ideas that arrive

4374.159 --> 4378.32
and then you can't express them they're

4376.32 --> 4380.4
not lost not really

4378.32 --> 4383.5199999999995
they will return if they're good ideas

4380.4 --> 4384.799999999999
they will return it always does

4383.52 --> 4385.6
if they don't

4384.8 --> 4389.12
then

4385.6 --> 4392.0
they weren't that important after all

4389.12 --> 4394.239
it's something that i learned

4392.0 --> 4395.92
that is basically you can't forget

4394.239 --> 4397.599999999999
things you don't have to worry that

4395.92 --> 4400.56
something that pops in your head is

4397.6 --> 4403.280000000001
going to be lost forever

4400.56 --> 4406.56
don't worry about that

4403.28 --> 4407.44
all the information comes from god

4406.56 --> 4412.64
and

4407.44 --> 4415.28
god is everywhere at all times

4412.64 --> 4417.6
and he doesn't forget so if there was

4415.28 --> 4420.0
something that's really important and

4417.6 --> 4423.04
you can't do anything with it in the

4420.0 --> 4424.88
moment then it will just return at a

4423.04 --> 4427.5199999999995
later point and you'll be the same

4424.88 --> 4429.679
person maybe even more refined

4427.52 --> 4431.990000000001
so the the pattern will just fit the

4429.679 --> 4433.6
same

4431.99 --> 4435.84
[Music]

4433.6 --> 4438.159000000001
don't worry don't worry about forgetting

4435.84 --> 4438.159000000001
things

4439.76 --> 4444.96
i mean worry about forgetting things

4441.92 --> 4447.52
when you start to rely on tactics like

4444.96 --> 4449.76
lying that's when you start the need to

4447.52 --> 4452.84
worry about forgetting things because

4449.76 --> 4455.4400000000005
then you are fabricating outside of the

4452.84 --> 4457.84
truth that's when forgetting things

4455.44 --> 4458.719
actually becomes a problem if you never

4457.84 --> 4462.88
lie

4458.719 --> 4462.88
then forgetting things is not a problem

4465.92 --> 4469.4
i live that

4471.49 --> 4475.76
[Music]

4473.6 --> 4478.320000000001
i mean it can still be inconvenient

4475.76 --> 4481.12
right if you forgot something

4478.32 --> 4483.92
just basic things yeah it's annoying but

4481.12 --> 4486.5599999999995
it's not really devastating

4483.92 --> 4490.2390000000005
it's not like oh my god i lost it the

4486.56 --> 4492.320000000001
one chance no no no ideas come back

4490.239 --> 4495.32
if they're really important they come

4492.32 --> 4495.32
back

4506.719 --> 4511.92
that's right seeking yeah yeah when you

4509.84 --> 4513.84
tell the truth you don't need to

4511.92 --> 4515.6
remember what you said

4513.84 --> 4516.719
that's correct

4515.6 --> 4518.719
it's

4516.719 --> 4521.679
beautiful

4518.719 --> 4523.76
it's beautiful it's such a release of

4521.679 --> 4525.36
burden for me

4523.76 --> 4528.12
you know why

4525.36 --> 4531.5199999999995
because i don't have really optimal

4528.12 --> 4532.4
memorization skills you see

4531.52 --> 4535.280000000001
but

4532.4 --> 4537.28
i have the skills to figure out things

4535.28 --> 4539.759999999999
right as they present themselves to me

4537.28 --> 4542.32
very quickly

4539.76 --> 4544.2390000000005
but i don't have a lot of great memory

4542.32 --> 4545.679
skills

4544.239 --> 4548.4
so

4545.679 --> 4551.28
speaking the truth is like

4548.4 --> 4554.4
mental survival for me

4551.28 --> 4557.679
it's literally like i can't

4554.4 --> 4559.4
step away from that i can't do it

4557.679 --> 4562.0
i'll literally

4559.4 --> 4564.239
disintegrate mentally right in front of

4562.0 --> 4564.239
you

4564.32 --> 4569.679
like the worries will start to pile on

4566.64 --> 4572.320000000001
and then the cohesion just becomes

4569.679 --> 4576.4800000000005
is it'll i'll lose it

4572.32 --> 4580.12
i can't lie i can't afford to lie

4576.48 --> 4580.12
with how i work

4582.9 --> 4585.95
[Music]

4595.679 --> 4599.76
and it's even like this right

4599.04 --> 4601.76
so

4599.76 --> 4603.76
let let's say just an out there in the

4601.76 --> 4606.84
field example you're going somewhere are

4603.76 --> 4609.84
you doing something and then something

4606.84 --> 4610.719
happens and somebody asks you like hey

4609.84 --> 4612.64
what

4610.719 --> 4614.2390000000005
what's this

4612.64 --> 4616.0
and you can't deal with it so you're

4614.239 --> 4617.919999999999
gonna make up an excuse for it in the

4616.0 --> 4620.84
moment right it happens it happens to

4617.92 --> 4624.88
the best of us it's like

4620.84 --> 4626.88
this but you know it was actually wrong

4624.88 --> 4629.36
well

4626.88 --> 4631.92
in the moment it doesn't have to do much

4629.36 --> 4634.32
harm but if you don't come back at it at

4631.92 --> 4636.4800000000005
some point and basically say like yeah

4634.32 --> 4638.0
that time when i said this it wasn't

4636.48 --> 4640.08
actually that but i

4638.0 --> 4642.48
just had to say something

4640.08 --> 4644.159
if you correct it then it's no problem

4642.48 --> 4647.199
either

4644.159 --> 4649.12
if you leave it be

4647.199 --> 4650.5599999999995
however

4649.12 --> 4654.5599999999995
that's

4650.56 --> 4658.8
when things very unexpectedly can go all

4654.56 --> 4658.8
weird and diagonal on you

4659.199 --> 4665.5199999999995
if you just lie about things

4663.04 --> 4667.5199999999995
for temporary reasons but you then don't

4665.52 --> 4669.76
correct them

4667.52 --> 4669.76
then

4670.239 --> 4675.44
it changes retroactively from something

4673.199 --> 4677.678999999999
that's relatively harmless and in the

4675.44 --> 4679.12
moment thing that can easily be restored

4677.679 --> 4681.92
into

4679.12 --> 4685.76
like a weird

4681.92 --> 4688.4800000000005
way yeah with spread out

4685.76 --> 4690.400000000001
water muddying lie

4688.48 --> 4692.4
be careful with that

4690.4 --> 4694.96
right always be careful with that that's

4692.4 --> 4697.599999999999
why universally i consider it so

4694.96 --> 4700.0
important that if you make a mistake

4697.6 --> 4701.679
you have to correct it

4700.0 --> 4704.88
it's not even

4701.679 --> 4708.64
for the awareness of the person

4704.88 --> 4709.6
nope that it is involved with it's for

4708.64 --> 4712.320000000001
you

4709.6 --> 4715.679
it's for you you have to correct it for

4712.32 --> 4717.679
you for your own cohesion or you might

4715.679 --> 4721.32
end up muddying

4717.679 --> 4721.32
your own water

4722.27 --> 4729.01
[Music]

4730.8 --> 4734.8
right every time you lie lose a piece of

4733.12 --> 4736.88
that but that's why you got to deal with

4734.8 --> 4739.84
it rig back

4736.88 --> 4741.28
right if you're doing a white lie

4739.84 --> 4744.96
figure out

4741.28 --> 4748.239
how you can get back later

4744.96 --> 4749.36
and address it again

4748.239 --> 4752.799999999999
and then

4749.36 --> 4755.04
explain what happened

4752.8 --> 4756.8
and maybe you can even figure out what

4755.04 --> 4759.28
would have been a more effective more

4756.8 --> 4762.08
honest way to say it instead of what you

4759.28 --> 4765.599999999999
did right

4762.08 --> 4768.239
just don't try to just forget it

4765.6 --> 4770.320000000001
you have the response internal response

4768.239 --> 4772.239
like that for a reason you have to do

4770.32 --> 4774.48
something with that

4772.239 --> 4777.199
or it'll go away and then you've got a

4774.48 --> 4780.4
real problem

4777.199 --> 4782.28
because then you lose track

4780.4 --> 4786.29
over truth

4782.28 --> 4786.29
[Music]

4794.239 --> 4797.28
your mind melted

4803.199 --> 4807.44
hmm

4805.28 --> 4809.199
yeah well i agree

4807.44 --> 4812.239
i am like like

4809.199 --> 4814.48
thoughts can be bad

4812.239 --> 4814.48
right

4814.639 --> 4818.2390000000005
lying

4816.08 --> 4820.719
and speaking the truth is not just about

4818.239 --> 4823.44
a conversation between you and somebody

4820.719 --> 4825.28
else face to face or over the phone or

4823.44 --> 4829.199
over the internet

4825.28 --> 4829.199
it's also inside of you

4829.76 --> 4835.360000000001
it is there is no place to really hide

4832.4 --> 4836.96
you can think that you have a private

4835.36 --> 4839.599999999999
mind

4836.96 --> 4840.639
and you can do whatever you like

4839.6 --> 4843.84
but it's

4840.639 --> 4843.84
really not true

4844.239 --> 4848.4
your god is still watching

4848.8 --> 4856.719
and other people this is even weirder

4852.719 --> 4860.0
can still figure out what happened

4856.719 --> 4862.8
inside your head because it will still

4860.0 --> 4865.84
change you what you think inside and

4862.8 --> 4865.84
keep to yourself

4866.8 --> 4872.56
right so from a legal standpoint yeah

4870.239 --> 4874.718999999999
your thoughts are your own

4872.56 --> 4877.4400000000005
you can't be

4874.719 --> 4878.4800000000005
persecuted legally for thinking things

4877.44 --> 4880.879999999999
right

4878.48 --> 4884.159
they can't but

4880.88 --> 4886.4800000000005
that's earthly law

4884.159 --> 4889.199
it comes to cosmic or

4886.48 --> 4892.638999999999
divine law with god

4889.199 --> 4895.839999999999
there's no real difference if you think

4892.639 --> 4900.679
bad things but you don't act them

4895.84 --> 4900.679
you effectively still let them in

4907.04 --> 4911.12
constant awareness living in the now

4908.96 --> 4913.04
well not necessarily look

4911.12 --> 4916.639
you can still dream and you can still

4913.04 --> 4921.44
even have considerations

4916.639 --> 4925.6
right test your own ideas internally

4921.44 --> 4925.599999999999
also confront things like

4925.679 --> 4929.679
what would i do if i met a person like

4928.239 --> 4931.839999999999
this

4929.679 --> 4934.56
what would i do if i

4931.84 --> 4936.8
saw something happen like that

4934.56 --> 4936.8
right

4937.12 --> 4940.48
just

4938.32 --> 4942.96
take it serious like even your

4940.48 --> 4945.5199999999995
imagination take it serious like as if

4942.96 --> 4947.6
it were real then it you're basically

4945.52 --> 4948.96
simulating you're emulating but you're

4947.6 --> 4951.280000000001
being true

4948.96 --> 4954.4
to your own frequency to your own

4951.28 --> 4956.48
pattern as if it were the real world

4954.4 --> 4958.239
if you think like that if you imagine

4956.48 --> 4961.759999999999
like that

4958.239 --> 4961.759999999999
then everything will be all right

4964.08 --> 4969.76
just don't split yourself up into oh i

4967.12 --> 4971.92
gotta be good to the outside world and

4969.76 --> 4974.08
inside it can be an evil little grabbler

4971.92 --> 4974.08
and

4974.4 --> 4976.799999999999
no

4975.12 --> 4978.4
if you do that

4976.8 --> 4981.4400000000005
it's gonna

4978.4 --> 4983.44
it's gonna mix it's gonna mix

4981.44 --> 4986.5599999999995
the internal world's gonna mix with the

4983.44 --> 4989.759999999999
outside world it's gonna leak through

4986.56 --> 4992.320000000001
if you do that it will it will outside

4989.76 --> 4995.56
of your own consciousness happen

4992.32 --> 4995.5599999999995
it mixes

4996.81 --> 4999.879000000001
[Music]

5000.96 --> 5005.28
all right yeah big skinny show thanks

5003.36 --> 5007.92
for popping by and chat thanks for the

5005.28 --> 5007.92
conversation

5008.48 --> 5011.759999999999
today's show is pretty good

5012.56 --> 5017.76
more esoterics spiritual internal

5015.12 --> 5017.76
workings

5018.08 --> 5021.5199999999995
talking about this is literally helping

5020.0 --> 5025.0
my

5021.52 --> 5025.0
my a care

5033.6 --> 5040.0
right but definitely i had a bad thought

5036.719 --> 5042.32
that that can happen i've had

5040.0 --> 5044.639
moments where i woke up in the morning

5042.32 --> 5046.639
and then i realized jesus christ what

5044.639 --> 5049.84
the hell was i thinking about

5046.639 --> 5051.4400000000005
during that that's messed up

5049.84 --> 5053.0
there's like

5051.44 --> 5055.04
postulates

5053.0 --> 5058.4
experimental mind experimental

5055.04 --> 5060.08
postulates that i was dealing with like

5058.4 --> 5063.199
30 years ago

5060.08 --> 5066.88
and i'm like oh my god did i just

5063.199 --> 5070.919999999999
imagine all that that's so [ __ ] up

5066.88 --> 5070.92
i don't want to

5072.08 --> 5075.84
right

5073.52 --> 5078.159000000001
sometimes you can't stop your mind from

5075.84 --> 5081.04
wandering into disgusting things like

5078.159 --> 5082.5599999999995
torture things or like

5081.04 --> 5085.6
even worse like

5082.56 --> 5087.84
pedo [ __ ] like super [ __ ] up think she

5085.6 --> 5089.679
just you don't want that right sometimes

5087.84 --> 5091.6
it's just like

5089.679 --> 5093.4400000000005
something like that comes by and then

5091.6 --> 5095.280000000001
you have to deal with it

5093.44 --> 5096.08
well the way to deal with it mostly is

5095.28 --> 5100.0
to

5096.08 --> 5105.12
as soon as you become aware of it

5100.0 --> 5105.12
be honest don't make excuses and just

5105.84 --> 5110.639
abandon it just like as you would

5108.4 --> 5112.5599999999995
abandon a sinner

5110.639 --> 5114.159000000001
when they sin

5112.56 --> 5115.76
in your presence

5114.159 --> 5118.08
it's like oh

5115.76 --> 5119.92
you're [ __ ] up i'm not gonna deal with

5118.08 --> 5121.5199999999995
you anymore

5119.92 --> 5123.76
you have to kind of do that with your

5121.52 --> 5126.2390000000005
own thoughts if something freaky

5123.76 --> 5128.08
unexpectedly comes by right and it can

5126.239 --> 5129.678999999999
happen you can just

5128.08 --> 5133.04
watch a

5129.679 --> 5134.96
radio show or a movie or a series and

5133.04 --> 5137.6
then suddenly something happens that's

5134.96 --> 5139.36
like outside of your comfort zone and

5137.6 --> 5141.679
they basically bring forth or they

5139.36 --> 5144.5599999999995
trigger a memory that you try to forget

5141.679 --> 5147.36
and then it might pop back in

5144.56 --> 5149.360000000001
right this is annoying when it happens

5147.36 --> 5151.5199999999995
and it can be like very make you

5149.36 --> 5153.28
restless

5151.52 --> 5154.96
don't worry about that

5153.28 --> 5157.28
it will happen

5154.96 --> 5159.36
just know how to deal with it

5157.28 --> 5163.759999999999
don't hold on to it don't think oh i'm

5159.36 --> 5163.759999999999
thinking it so it's okay no no no no no

5166.239 --> 5171.44
just recognize it for what it is

5169.52 --> 5173.120000000001
and step away

5171.44 --> 5175.36
from it

5173.12 --> 5176.96
drop it

5175.36 --> 5178.719
like one of the things is like oh you

5176.96 --> 5180.88
keep thinking about it like a weird

5178.719 --> 5182.88
obsession loop or something

5180.88 --> 5185.679
well there's only one way to get rid of

5182.88 --> 5188.639
that in any situation and that is

5185.679 --> 5191.04
actively do something else that requires

5188.639 --> 5193.28
your focus right i had these types of

5191.04 --> 5194.48
moments in

5193.28 --> 5197.199
roughly

5194.48 --> 5198.638999999999
20 years ago when i was in a really bad

5197.199 --> 5202.5599999999995
place

5198.639 --> 5202.56
what i did was basically

5205.6 --> 5209.360000000001
make this

5207.6 --> 5211.360000000001
this thing

5209.36 --> 5213.5199999999995
right

5211.36 --> 5217.92
and it took me like hours and hours and

5213.52 --> 5220.639
hours but i had to do that i had to

5217.92 --> 5222.8
just do that like monks work i had to do

5220.639 --> 5225.12
it do it do it do it do i do it because

5222.8 --> 5227.52
it was the only thing

5225.12 --> 5231.92
that wasn't going to make me like hurt

5227.52 --> 5231.92
myself because of how terrible i felt

5235.12 --> 5239.12
it was the only thing i could do right

5237.12 --> 5241.84
when terrible things get in your head

5239.12 --> 5244.08
you have to find something to actively

5241.84 --> 5246.639
get away from it

5244.08 --> 5249.679
now what is an effective way potentially

5246.639 --> 5252.0
to get away from it well craft

5249.679 --> 5253.4400000000005
working on something or like writing a

5252.0 --> 5256.32
book

5253.44 --> 5257.44
if you're like into like doing that into

5256.32 --> 5259.199
writing

5257.44 --> 5261.839999999999
right because then

5259.199 --> 5264.08
the thought the gross idea the terrible

5261.84 --> 5265.1990000000005
thing you don't want in there

5264.08 --> 5267.92
can't

5265.199 --> 5270.32
grasp you anymore can have your internal

5267.92 --> 5273.1990000000005
focus focus on that because you're

5270.32 --> 5274.5599999999995
instead focusing on another production

5273.199 --> 5276.96
of something or

5274.56 --> 5279.1990000000005
a procedure

5276.96 --> 5281.22
and that can be a great way to get away

5279.199 --> 5287.44
from terrible thoughts

5281.22 --> 5290.719
[Music]

5287.44 --> 5294.759999999999
right or work in your garden great way

5290.719 --> 5294.76
to get rid of bad thoughts

5298.239 --> 5302.718999999999
right or

5300.08 --> 5304.96
like playing with animals also like

5302.719 --> 5306.8
anything that will just draw your focus

5304.96 --> 5308.639
away from the image in your mind that

5306.8 --> 5310.639
you don't want to see

5308.639 --> 5312.56
and just stay

5310.639 --> 5314.400000000001
stay focused on

5312.56 --> 5315.92
not thinking about not even thinking

5314.4 --> 5317.599999999999
about not thinking about it just

5315.92 --> 5320.84
literally

5317.6 --> 5322.4800000000005
it's not there i'm thinking about this

5320.84 --> 5324.08
until

5322.48 --> 5326.5599999999995
you basically stop doing it and you

5324.08 --> 5328.4
realize like wait why was i doing this

5326.56 --> 5331.52
oh yeah it was to get away from a bad

5328.4 --> 5334.638999999999
thought huh it worked

5331.52 --> 5334.639
and then you know you're done

5334.88 --> 5339.76
do you play any instruments

5337.76 --> 5342.08
uh no not really

5339.76 --> 5344.96
i use my voice though i do kind of

5342.08 --> 5349.48
singing and whistling

5344.96 --> 5349.4800000000005
that's just my personal amusement

5351.04 --> 5357.12
so i'm kind of a vocalist

5354.239 --> 5359.44
i learned to play the flute

5357.12 --> 5362.159
when i was a kid it's just not really

5359.44 --> 5363.04
something i was very ambitious about

5362.159 --> 5366.32
after

5363.04 --> 5366.32
i became a teenager

5366.719 --> 5373.04
so no i'm not really

5370.0 --> 5375.44
an instrument guy

5373.04 --> 5379.84
tried to play a bit of guitar but just

5375.44 --> 5379.839999999999
did not have the patience for it

5382.239 --> 5386.159
jamming on your guitar while watching

5383.92 --> 5386.159
okay

5386.239 --> 5388.5599999999995
cool

5389.679 --> 5393.6
no but i do have some

5391.44 --> 5395.919999999999
some still have some dormant singing

5393.6 --> 5397.84
ambitions i guess

5395.92 --> 5400.0
it's just that my voice i always thought

5397.84 --> 5401.84
that my voice wasn't good enough

5400.0 --> 5404.88
and then i like started smoking and i

5401.84 --> 5409.28
was like yeah it's never gonna be good

5404.88 --> 5411.28
i mean i still have very good like

5409.28 --> 5413.199
uh

5411.28 --> 5414.48
tone control

5413.199 --> 5417.199
but

5414.48 --> 5418.08
you know real singing often involves

5417.199 --> 5421.839999999999
like

5418.08 --> 5424.159
really being loud and like oh

5421.84 --> 5426.639
full lungs well that's when

5424.159 --> 5429.12
problems start to arrive i can't do that

5426.639 --> 5431.04
for very long

5429.12 --> 5432.8
that's also when my vocal cords start

5431.04 --> 5434.88
showing that they're not

5432.8 --> 5437.4400000000005
that great i don't have like the

5434.88 --> 5440.32
ultimate singer's focal cards

5437.44 --> 5441.5199999999995
but i do have kind of a high pitch to

5440.32 --> 5445.159
low

5441.52 --> 5445.159000000001
sound range

5448.89 --> 5452.8
[Music]

5451.04 --> 5456.08
we're gonna form a band now the flat

5452.8 --> 5458.2390000000005
earth early bird band

5456.08 --> 5462.679
this is

5458.239 --> 5462.678999999999
of the flat earth early bend

5464.0 --> 5468.4
sounds hilarious

5466.56 --> 5470.56
but yeah i grew up

5468.4 --> 5471.92
you know my both my parents were

5470.56 --> 5474.8
musicians

5471.92 --> 5477.84
they were literally playing in a band

5474.8 --> 5481.12
as a baby i was like in studios where

5477.84 --> 5483.04
they would be playing music

5481.12 --> 5485.199
and my mother was did a lot with

5483.04 --> 5487.5199999999995
recording studios he was

5485.199 --> 5489.44
at the conservatory in amsterdam

5487.52 --> 5491.76
like one of the videos that are on this

5489.44 --> 5494.08
channel is literally music my mother

5491.76 --> 5496.320000000001
composed

5494.08 --> 5498.639
so yeah my father's been a guitar

5496.32 --> 5500.96
teacher his entire life until he got too

5498.639 --> 5504.400000000001
much trouble with his finger so he

5500.96 --> 5508.159
retired from that

5504.4 --> 5508.159
so yeah music all around

5508.32 --> 5513.0
i have a very good musical hearing

5518.96 --> 5521.36
wow

5523.36 --> 5526.4
you're

5524.48 --> 5529.4
a jaina fall trade so you can start

5526.4 --> 5529.4
water

5551.679 --> 5556.88
that's nice

5553.92 --> 5556.88
singing star wars

5557.12 --> 5564.44
like to hear the black swan song live

5561.44 --> 5564.44
right

5592.239 --> 5596.159
right

5593.28 --> 5596.159
well i think that

5596.4 --> 5601.28
i've had plenty of opportunity to really

5598.719 --> 5604.96
learn to play musical instruments it's

5601.28 --> 5607.199
just i never had the patience never

5604.96 --> 5610.0
it always like

5607.199 --> 5613.44
i don't want to do this anymore

5610.0 --> 5615.44
like i like it would make me angry to

5613.44 --> 5617.36
imagine that i would have to do the same

5615.44 --> 5620.5599999999995
[ __ ] thing like

5617.36 --> 5623.199
years every day or something

5620.56 --> 5625.360000000001
just to get a little better i hated that

5623.199 --> 5626.879999999999
idea i did so it just never really

5625.36 --> 5628.159
worked out for me

5626.88 --> 5631.1990000000005
but

5628.159 --> 5634.5599999999995
i do like to be able to do things so

5631.199 --> 5637.839999999999
i'm i might be a bit of like a jack of

5634.56 --> 5640.159000000001
all trades where i can like play a bit

5637.84 --> 5641.92
i'll figure out how to play a little bit

5640.159 --> 5644.719
kind of quickly

5641.92 --> 5646.56
pretty sure i could do some guitar

5644.719 --> 5650.8
it's just i don't really want to keep

5646.56 --> 5652.4800000000005
doing it constantly and constantly right

5650.8 --> 5655.12
but i mean it would be pretty cool if i

5652.48 --> 5656.839999999999
like learn how to play the harp and i

5655.12 --> 5659.12
think that would be kind of

5656.84 --> 5661.28
easy and

5659.12 --> 5664.639
well flute i have plenty of experience

5661.28 --> 5664.639
it's just a matter of getting back

5665.199 --> 5669.719
piano

5666.4 --> 5669.719
very difficult

5672.56 --> 5677.280000000001
my mother was pretty good with piano she

5674.96 --> 5679.52
composed music with it

5677.28 --> 5679.5199999999995
i

5681.04 --> 5685.679
there's something about like multiple

5683.76 --> 5688.320000000001
tones like with

5685.679 --> 5690.4
i don't know if i can do that

5688.32 --> 5694.0
i tried it a bit as i was a kid but it

5690.4 --> 5697.36
was just very difficult for me

5694.0 --> 5697.36
like it gave me a headache

5697.52 --> 5700.4800000000005
uh

5698.4 --> 5702.719
doing it not listening listening is

5700.48 --> 5704.48
great

5702.719 --> 5706.8
the only real thing that kind of came

5704.48 --> 5709.28
natural to me always is just the ability

5706.8 --> 5709.28
to sing

5709.679 --> 5715.76
and i don't necessarily i'm not like a

5712.4 --> 5716.879999999999
singer that's just constantly singing

5715.76 --> 5718.320000000001
but

5716.88 --> 5720.8
in my own

5718.32 --> 5723.44
i am constantly saying i'm constantly

5720.8 --> 5725.84
having melodies and like seriously right

5723.44 --> 5729.28
now at this very moment while i'm doing

5725.84 --> 5731.679
the show i am having a very specific

5729.28 --> 5735.5199999999995
part of a classical music piece in my

5731.679 --> 5738.2390000000005
mind from civilization five

5735.52 --> 5740.719
where there's like uh

5738.239 --> 5740.718999999999
cello

5741.119 --> 5746.239
uh tambourine

5743.76 --> 5748.56
and drums and i'm hearing that literally

5746.239 --> 5750.48
in my mind right now as i'm doing this

5748.56 --> 5753.280000000001
show it's like a background music i'm

5750.48 --> 5754.08
literally hearing that

5753.28 --> 5757.119
because

5754.08 --> 5759.92
and then sometimes i like to sing what i

5757.119 --> 5762.5599999999995
hear and i'll do it correctly

5759.92 --> 5766.4800000000005
i'll sing like multiple parties at the

5762.56 --> 5766.4800000000005
same time right through one another

5767.44 --> 5771.5199999999995
it's just

5768.8 --> 5774.2390000000005
to really perform singing is just

5771.52 --> 5774.2390000000005
something else

5783.04 --> 5786.639
learned from watching my dad play from a

5785.28 --> 5789.04
young age

5786.639 --> 5791.92
right well if you got into it i mean

5789.04 --> 5794.96
i've watched my parents play musical

5791.92 --> 5799.159
instruments my entire life

5794.96 --> 5799.159
it didn't really work for me

5799.52 --> 5804.320000000001
every time i heard the music i would

5801.36 --> 5807.759999999999
just be like yeah i wanna dance

5804.32 --> 5809.759999999999
and if maybe sing and here's the funny

5807.76 --> 5814.2390000000005
thing

5809.76 --> 5817.280000000001
i'm a much much better singer

5814.239 --> 5820.08
than my mother or my father ever was i

5817.28 --> 5822.159
was always much better at it but i just

5820.08 --> 5825.36
never really

5822.159 --> 5825.36
became a singer

5825.44 --> 5828.32
i was like

5826.4 --> 5830.5599999999995
intimidated

5828.32 --> 5830.5599999999995
like

5831.119 --> 5836.96
but like my parents were terrible

5832.8 --> 5836.96
singers like they can't sing for [ __ ]

5838.239 --> 5842.718999999999
i can and i've trained it

5840.96 --> 5845.199
a bit

5842.719 --> 5848.4
like in my internal thing i just

5845.199 --> 5849.28
everything i do i have to become better

5848.4 --> 5850.32
at

5849.28 --> 5852.239
always

5850.32 --> 5855.5199999999995
everything my entire life and that

5852.239 --> 5858.08
includes singing and getting it right

5855.52 --> 5860.320000000001
it's like learning how to get certain

5858.08 --> 5863.04
effects that are beautiful in a music

5860.32 --> 5865.599999999999
piece how to exactly accomplish that

5863.04 --> 5869.36
effect with my vocal cords

5865.6 --> 5871.679
i train those things

5869.36 --> 5873.599999999999
and by the way that entire training has

5871.679 --> 5877.119
significantly helped me

5873.6 --> 5878.88
with my speech art as well

5877.119 --> 5881.599999999999
because it just gave me a lot more

5878.88 --> 5883.84
control over how i use my voice when i'm

5881.6 --> 5883.84
talking

5893.119 --> 5897.28
can't read music either well

5895.679 --> 5899.28
i could

5897.28 --> 5901.119
i'm not very good at it though it's just

5899.28 --> 5902.96
that

5901.119 --> 5905.44
i have to like

5902.96 --> 5907.6
first understand what the music is then

5905.44 --> 5910.159
once i really understand the pattern of

5907.6 --> 5911.84
the music then i can like synchronize

5910.159 --> 5915.119
with musical

5911.84 --> 5918.2390000000005
paper like oh oh this is what that

5915.119 --> 5920.32
represents if i don't know the song i

5918.239 --> 5922.5599999999995
can never i've never been able to like

5920.32 --> 5925.679
make out what a song is just from

5922.56 --> 5927.52
reading musical paper i have to know the

5925.679 --> 5929.679
song first and then

5927.52 --> 5933.119000000001
i can synchronize my knowledge of the

5929.679 --> 5935.119
song with the musical paper

5933.119 --> 5937.759999999999
but without knowing the song first it's

5935.119 --> 5938.719
just like i don't know what i'm looking

5937.76 --> 5940.88
at

5938.719 --> 5942.96
i can roughly guess

5940.88 --> 5944.88
but it'll take me kind of long to really

5942.96 --> 5947.76
figure it out what what is actually

5944.88 --> 5949.52
represented what it's representative of

5947.76 --> 5951.52
anyway i think i'm going to run out the

5949.52 --> 5954.2390000000005
show

5951.52 --> 5954.2390000000005
