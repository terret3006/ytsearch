is

119.759 --> 124.799
cloudy hazy

122.32 --> 126.88
not a lot of thick clouds but just this

124.799 --> 129.84
white haze everywhere

126.88 --> 129.84
and there is rain

131.599 --> 137.28
it's very similar to yesterday

134.64 --> 138.879
yesterday also it did go and rain a lot

137.28 --> 142.44
more in the afternoon

138.879 --> 142.44
after my show

143.2 --> 146.79999999999998
so that seems to be a bit of a trend in

145.04 --> 149.44
the morning it's kind of like a bit

146.8 --> 150.64000000000001
dreary

149.44 --> 153.04
with a

150.64 --> 153.83999999999997
bunch of droplets here and there but

153.04 --> 156.0
then

153.84 --> 158.08
like deeper in the afternoon is when it

156.0 --> 161.2
usually starts to really rain

158.08 --> 161.20000000000002
in this last week

163.2 --> 166.2
right

177.519 --> 184.20000000000002
okay it is wednesday the 8th of june

181.2 --> 184.2
2022

187.04 --> 189.35999999999999
uh

190.56 --> 194.159
probably

191.599 --> 196.319
in the middle of the summer now

194.159 --> 199.04
or a lot of people

196.319 --> 200.56
although yeah it does seem to be raining

199.04 --> 202.56
a lot

200.56 --> 203.36
so in england i don't know what whether

202.56 --> 204.879
it's

203.36 --> 208.36
like

204.879 --> 208.35999999999999
united states

212.64 --> 215.11999999999998
all right

222.879 --> 226.39999999999998
so

223.84 --> 228.64000000000001
there's more confirmation stories coming

226.4 --> 228.64000000000001
out

228.879 --> 235.599
that

229.92 --> 235.599
monkey box is indeed butt monkey box

238.4 --> 241.84
there's one article

244.159 --> 247.76
that was very revealing

252.799 --> 258.23900000000003
right so still waiting until somebody's

255.2 --> 259.59999999999997
going to show up in my chat

258.239 --> 262.23999999999995
or maybe it's going to be like the

259.6 --> 264.40000000000003
flatter talk days again it's just no no

262.24 --> 268.04

will pipe up

268.58 --> 273.35999999999996
[Music]

i wasn't even realizing that

280.0 --> 283.919
or was it a week ago man sometimes i

282.0 --> 286.16
don't know it's like two weeks ago or a

283.919 --> 288.4
week ago

286.16 --> 292.28000000000003
the time when i was ranting about the

288.4 --> 292.28
five-minute silence

296.479 --> 299.84
let's see what was that

303.039 --> 307.199
yeah that's last week is not two weeks

304.88 --> 307.199
ago

307.6 --> 310.6

379.759 --> 383.84000000000003
my show's already running for six

381.44 --> 383.84
minutes

388.0 --> 391.36
i'm starting late because

391.759 --> 394.40000000000003
so many

392.84 --> 396.79999999999995
times

394.4 --> 398.79999999999995
i start right on time and it's just

396.8 --> 401.44
waiting waiting waiting and everybody's

398.8 --> 401.44
all slow

402.639 --> 405.44
so yeah

405.6 --> 409.85
i don't see any direct objection of

407.84 --> 412.919
actually starting late

409.85 --> 412.91900000000004
[Music]

416.88 --> 422.919
besides i was watching home benjamin

419.68 --> 422.919
from yesterday

423.759 --> 426.8
that was interesting

430.96 --> 437.15999999999997
and i did not agree

433.52 --> 437.15999999999997
with all of it

438.96 --> 442.4
now what's going on

441.36 --> 443.91900000000004
it's me

442.4 --> 445.35999999999996
it's owen

443.919 --> 448.24
like in the last

445.36 --> 451.36
couple of weeks it's just this

448.24 --> 453.199
something's changed or is changing

451.36 --> 455.28000000000003
i don't know if it's for the better i

453.199 --> 456.8
don't know if he even knows it or if

455.28 --> 459.44
he's doing something

456.8 --> 459.44
on purpose

462.08 --> 465.479
i don't know

473.36 --> 478.199
right so what have you guys been up to

484.24 --> 490.319
yesterday's flat earth debate was great

487.12 --> 492.56
again did round out very short

490.319 --> 495.91900000000004
very early or well not even that early

492.56 --> 497.52
it was like one hour after show

495.919 --> 500.08
but we were all disappointed we were

497.52 --> 502.479
because we had a lot of uh

500.08 --> 502.479
focus

502.56 --> 507.28000000000003
right later that evening was kiwi live

505.36 --> 508.24
but it didn't really hang around too

507.28 --> 509.67999999999995
much

508.24 --> 512.399
i don't know i wasn't in the mood at

509.68 --> 516.399
that moment too much

512.399 --> 517.44
instead i kind of hung around jim bob

516.399 --> 519.76
was

517.44 --> 522.32
live

519.76 --> 523.21
look at the yeah pretty much overlapping

522.32 --> 524.9590000000001
it

523.21 --> 528.5600000000001
[Music]

524.959 --> 528.56
that was very interesting again

531.279 --> 534.279
uh

541.76 --> 545.36
what happened in berlin what are you

543.839 --> 548.7600000000001

590.0 --> 594.88
what

592.32 --> 596.32
oh man just bumped into weird articles

594.88 --> 600.64
somebody apparently

596.32 --> 600.6400000000001
3d printed a rocket launcher

600.8 --> 605.0
so that's possible apparently

605.519 --> 607.44
one did

606.64 --> 610.079
i

607.44 --> 612.399
i don't know i didn't

610.079 --> 616.8389999999999
immediately bump into something so what

612.399 --> 616.839

670.88 --> 676.0
accident but you're not giving me

672.839 --> 678.5600000000001

when you can't scroll through it

761.76 --> 764.0

769.44 --> 773.48

778.56 --> 783.1199999999999
get with it or win do what the [ __ ]

783.76 --> 789.6
what do you mean get with it

786.72 --> 792.399
you're just like shoving [ __ ]

789.6 --> 795.279
in my chat and then expecting me to know

792.399 --> 795.279
everything about it

795.519 --> 801.44
like i don't follow that sort of thing

798.16 --> 804.7199999999999
you get it i'm not interested in like oh

801.44 --> 806.8000000000001

804.72 --> 809.8000000000001
oh

806.8 --> 809.8
okay

812.38 --> 818.24
[Music]

815.44 --> 820.639
apparently you are

818.24 --> 820.639
dart

821.76 --> 827.3199999999999
hello metal slugs cockatiel len lenox

830.56 --> 835.92
so was there any kind of point

833.12 --> 838.399
about bringing that up dart

835.92 --> 838.399
was there

840.399 --> 845.68
or is there some kind of a statement

842.959 --> 847.68
anything like why did you bring that up

845.68 --> 850.92
dart

847.68 --> 850.92
tell me

871.279 --> 875.12
doesn't seem like an accident when you

873.12 --> 878.079
do that i don't know

875.12 --> 882.44
dude i've seen like cars do some weird

878.079 --> 882.4399999999999
[ __ ] completely by accident

884.8 --> 888.0
i mean

886.32 --> 889.36
some of these electronic cars they can

888.0 --> 891.839
just like

889.36 --> 893.6800000000001
something in the driving system can snap

891.839 --> 896.72
and then it will just like

893.68 --> 898.7199999999999
like uncontrollably full speed ahead if

896.72 --> 900.8000000000001
you happen to be just right into a

898.72 --> 902.639
market in a crowd yeah you could just

900.8 --> 904.8
without any control

902.639 --> 906.5600000000001
over your vehicle just ram into that

904.8 --> 909.519
[ __ ]

906.56 --> 912.8
so it in my mind yeah that is possible

909.519 --> 915.44
but it seems like this person

912.8 --> 918.24
whatever

915.44 --> 920.8800000000001
did it on purpose or something so i'm

918.24 --> 920.88
not gonna

923.68 --> 928.399
yeah i'm not gonna suggest that it was

925.44 --> 930.1600000000001
an accident or anything

928.399 --> 932.16
he brought it up to give me a talking

930.16 --> 933.759
point yeah but why though

932.16 --> 936.0
what's the point

933.759 --> 937.12
is there anything about it

936.0 --> 938.079
i mean

937.12 --> 941.839
yeah

938.079 --> 941.8389999999999
terrible things happen

957.279 --> 961.519
a right heart attack behind the wheel

959.6 --> 962.8000000000001
yeah

961.519 --> 965.279
indeed

962.8 --> 967.12
it's all kinds of way it could go wrong

965.279 --> 968.56
does it mean that this

967.12 --> 972.72
was

968.56 --> 972.7199999999999
that that it wasn't on purpose

974.24 --> 978.24
it's just that i just want to know why

977.44 --> 981.72
why

978.24 --> 981.72
what's the point

986.399 --> 991.199
right i mean i could very easily say

988.8 --> 993.3599999999999
yeah oh yesterday yes somebody

991.199 --> 994.959
somebody died in my city

993.36 --> 998.32
you know why

994.959 --> 1000.6389999999999
because ambulances were in a heavy hurry

998.32 --> 1000.639
and then

1002.16 --> 1006.56
like really a hurry and then i didn't

1004.48 --> 1008.32
hear them anymore and

1006.56 --> 1010.6389999999999
that's usually a sign that they're too

1008.32 --> 1012.639
late or something right

1010.639 --> 1016.279
like what's the point what's the point

1012.639 --> 1016.279
of bringing that up

1027.839 --> 1031.8799999999999
yeah that sucks like alex

1054.59 --> 1057.75
[Music]

1065.679 --> 1070.4
right so anything else

1068.0 --> 1070.4
maybe

1071.2 --> 1077.72
anybody watch any

1073.28 --> 1077.72
interesting videos out there

1080.08 --> 1083.4399999999998
find new channels

1083.6 --> 1089.1999999999998
interesting things about video people

1086.64 --> 1089.2
out there

1092.84 --> 1097.6
anything anything you're doing in your

1095.76 --> 1100.16
life that might be particularly

1097.6 --> 1100.1599999999999
interesting

1107.12 --> 1111.2399999999998
just painting all right

1133.52 --> 1138.6399999999999
what

1135.43 --> 1140.96
[Music]

1138.64 --> 1141.919
not seen anything noteworthy

1140.96 --> 1145.679
right

1141.919 --> 1148.0800000000002
yeah me neither really it's just that

1145.679 --> 1150.72
still a lot of things developing i mean

1148.08 --> 1153.9189999999999
people's frequency change slightly

1150.72 --> 1153.919
depending on the day

1154.24 --> 1157.76
and

1155.52 --> 1159.039
i'm like i keep track of that with

1157.76 --> 1161.2
myself

1159.039 --> 1163.039
oh publicly here

1161.2 --> 1164.72
i'm also keeping track of that with

1163.039 --> 1166.64
everybody else that i'm actually

1164.72 --> 1170.08
interested in

1166.64 --> 1170.0800000000002
at least to a minor degree

1173.679 --> 1179.039
and hey earlier this show

1176.24 --> 1181.2
nobody rolled in yet i did mention like

1179.039 --> 1185.44
yeah i'm noticing this weird pattern

1181.2 --> 1185.44
here and there like i do that right but

1186.32 --> 1193.84
a lot of things that i think about all

1189.2 --> 1193.8400000000001
day long are very internal

1194.96 --> 1199.6000000000001
like

1196.64 --> 1203.2800000000002
if i literally shared it raw

1199.6 --> 1205.6
then 98 of everybody that even wants to

1203.28 --> 1208.48
tune in that's actually interested in me

1205.6 --> 1210.6399999999999
would probably not understand

1208.48 --> 1213.84
it's very rare

1210.64 --> 1216.88
and besides i don't want to

1213.84 --> 1216.8799999999999
do that like that

1217.12 --> 1221.84
i mean i'm already open enough as it is

1246.24 --> 1251.6
i see i see you're completely useless

1249.76 --> 1255.76
today okay

1251.6 --> 1255.76
i guess i'll just ignore the chat then

1256.159 --> 1259.159
uh

1263.84 --> 1269.76
i'm struggling a bit internally

1266.88 --> 1272.3200000000002
about things when i'm watching streams

1269.76 --> 1274.32
and i hear things or criticism and

1272.32 --> 1277.2
details being pointed out

1274.32 --> 1280.6399999999999
i still just like years ago

1277.2 --> 1282.48
it's not as dominating as it used to be

1280.64 --> 1285.039
but i still just have this weird

1282.48 --> 1287.6
sensation every time like if there's

1285.039 --> 1290.4
elements that are kind of specific that

1287.6 --> 1291.84
apply to me in any sort of way

1290.4 --> 1295.76
and i think that if somebody's

1291.84 --> 1298.799
criticizing like or describing

1295.76 --> 1301.6
like a a negative thing

1298.799 --> 1305.28
i have this heavy heavy tendency because

1301.6 --> 1308.1589999999999
of my empathy to think it's about me

1305.28 --> 1308.1589999999999
and that's like

1308.4 --> 1310.799
weird

1311.52 --> 1317.12
it's weird to realize that

1314.0 --> 1317.12
and still like

1317.84 --> 1322.6399999999999
yeah i fight it

1320.72 --> 1325.28
if i have to fight it a lot because

1322.64 --> 1327.76
sometimes i like i don't see it when it

1325.28 --> 1329.6789999999999
happens and i forget that it isn't

1327.76 --> 1331.76
actually like that

1329.679 --> 1333.1200000000001
i really do think it's about me all of a

1331.76 --> 1335.84
sudden

1333.12 --> 1337.4399999999998
just kind of gamma and that's even part

1335.84 --> 1340.1589999999999
of the shape

1337.44 --> 1342.24
so maybe it's like this weird trait from

1340.159 --> 1344.64
just being

1342.24 --> 1346.72
empathetic and overly vulnerable when i

1344.64 --> 1349.2
was much younger

1346.72 --> 1350.559
right because i would have that too but

1349.2 --> 1351.679
i have no

1350.559 --> 1354.0
grip on

1351.679 --> 1357.2
how my mind really worked i was just

1354.0 --> 1359.12
autopiloting all the time

1357.2 --> 1361.28
with a lot of things

1359.12 --> 1361.28
but

1366.159 --> 1369.7600000000002
yeah don't worry about it metal slugs

1368.32 --> 1373.2
coca teal

1369.76 --> 1376.32
hey if you want to talk about sauce

1373.2 --> 1378.0
you talk about sauce i'll i'll just

1376.32 --> 1379.36
pick something that

1378.0 --> 1381.76
is actually

1379.36 --> 1383.6
worth talking about

1381.76 --> 1387.32
okay

1383.6 --> 1387.32
don't take it personal

1396.72 --> 1401.28
coffee hasn't kicked in hello godzilla

1398.72 --> 1403.44
yeah that's fine that's fine right i'm

1401.28 --> 1407.039
i'm trying to not be

1403.44 --> 1410.3200000000002
like how [ __ ] dare you how dare you

1407.039 --> 1412.96
give me lip like this you bastards

1410.32 --> 1415.2
i'm gonna shove that brown sauce up your

1412.96 --> 1418.64
ass until you get monkey pucks you get

1415.2 --> 1422.72
it bring up something interesting say

1418.64 --> 1424.3200000000002
something smart already damn it

1422.72 --> 1427.44
i could do that

1424.32 --> 1428.799
but i thought well maybe i'll just talk

1427.44 --> 1431.279
about

1428.799 --> 1434.08
issues that i'm dealing with

1431.279 --> 1437.039
like [ __ ] somebody's talking about it oh

1434.08 --> 1440.96
when benjamin says people oh they go on

1437.039 --> 1440.96
social welfare and immediately

1441.12 --> 1445.84
like what is he [ __ ] talking about me

1446.08 --> 1449.76
that really [ __ ] hurt but it's

1448.799 --> 1450.799
me

1449.76 --> 1453.279
it's

1450.799 --> 1456.799
i'm pretty sure he wasn't talking about

1453.279 --> 1459.52
me and the overall description of gamma

1456.799 --> 1460.96
i don't fit that

1459.52 --> 1463.279
i have

1460.96 --> 1466.96
like remnant traits and i've even

1463.279 --> 1470.24
weirdly integrated it into what i do

1466.96 --> 1472.48
which is kind of wizard-like i guess

1470.24 --> 1474.48
but i'm not dominated

1472.48 --> 1475.919
by that

1474.48 --> 1477.76
so

1475.919 --> 1479.5200000000002
yeah i watched that this morning and it

1477.76 --> 1481.919
was kind of like

1479.52 --> 1485.039
[ __ ]

1481.919 --> 1487.6000000000001
everybody hates me

1485.039 --> 1490.32
yeah

1487.6 --> 1493.36
i get these moments still despite

1490.32 --> 1496.6789999999999
everything despite my confidence

1493.36 --> 1496.6789999999999
it's weird

1504.24 --> 1510.24
right and then like i keep on listening

1507.76 --> 1512.559
and then he just describes the really

1510.24 --> 1514.24
typical gamma things and then i have to

1512.559 --> 1515.6
laugh again because it's like yeah of

1514.24 --> 1517.84
course he's not talking about me what

1515.6 --> 1519.84
the hell was i thinking

1517.84 --> 1522.9599999999998
i mean just because i'm on social

1519.84 --> 1525.36
welfare in the netherlands

1522.96 --> 1528.159
doesn't mean that i am automatically a

1525.36 --> 1531.12
gamma

1528.159 --> 1533.7600000000002
i mean gammas are universally people

1531.12 --> 1535.76
that everybody likes to avoid and it

1533.76 --> 1538.32
stays that way

1535.76 --> 1538.32
i'm not

1538.64 --> 1544.0800000000002
i actually do

1541.2 --> 1546.799
on occasion and growing in

1544.08 --> 1549.4399999999998
in yeah in amounts

1546.799 --> 1552.32
in percentage of presence

1549.44 --> 1556.24
i am actually a bit magnetic i just

1552.32 --> 1558.72
don't really connect with people

1556.24 --> 1561.1200000000001
i keep it superficial because i'm bit

1558.72 --> 1565.2
skinny so it's like yeah you want to

1561.12 --> 1565.1999999999998
talk to me it better be serious

1567.279 --> 1572.64
right there has to be something serious

1570.96 --> 1575.8400000000001
somewhere

1572.64 --> 1577.5200000000002
behind like you have to take things

1575.84 --> 1579.52
serious you have to take life seriously

1577.52 --> 1581.679
you have to take food series you have to

1579.52 --> 1584.32
take media you have to take things

1581.679 --> 1586.64
serious in order to be able to to

1584.32 --> 1589.6789999999999
actually open

1586.64 --> 1592.7990000000002
face-to-face contact with me

1589.679 --> 1593.8400000000001
if you don't i'm just going to ignore

1592.799 --> 1596.24
you

1593.84 --> 1599.84
because you feel like you're going to be

1596.24 --> 1599.84
a waste of my time

1604.08 --> 1608.72
right so not a gamma

1606.48 --> 1611.44
but i am on social welfare and not

1608.72 --> 1613.52
everybody freaking hates me i do my best

1611.44 --> 1616.96
not to do that

1613.52 --> 1620.08
right it's actually a bit of a struggle

1616.96 --> 1621.919
because i also need to actually stick up

1620.08 --> 1624.32
for myself

1621.919 --> 1628.159
using my ego

1624.32 --> 1630.48
right but that if you overdo that then

1628.159 --> 1633.6000000000001
people start like getting repulsed by

1630.48 --> 1636.72
you as well so it's a difficult balance

1633.6 --> 1636.7199999999998
to keep in general

1639.6 --> 1641.84
right

1642.399 --> 1647.52
and it is really a balance

1644.96 --> 1650.48
i can't let it slide one way i can't let

1647.52 --> 1652.48
it slide the other way

1650.48 --> 1655.84
if i let it slide in any way it's gonna

1652.48 --> 1655.84
go wrong either way

1661.12 --> 1663.36
so

1663.44 --> 1666.159
there you go

1665.2 --> 1669.0
that's

1666.159 --> 1671.919
things that i deal with

1669.0 --> 1674.159
introspection struggling

1671.919 --> 1675.6000000000001
consciousness reflecting trying to

1674.159 --> 1677.44
dispel

1675.6 --> 1681.559
assertions

1677.44 --> 1681.559
made by my own background

1683.36 --> 1687.6789999999999
and to keep wading through that because

1685.52 --> 1691.44
it's always going to keep representing

1687.679 --> 1693.1200000000001
itself to me shoving itself in my face

1691.44 --> 1695.1200000000001
not even through other people but

1693.12 --> 1699.52
through myself through

1695.12 --> 1702.32
my side of the contact

1699.52 --> 1703.279
and i have to keep fighting that

1702.32 --> 1705.6789999999999
now

1703.279 --> 1708.48
let's say 10 years ago

1705.679 --> 1712.5590000000002
that impulse those reflections

1708.48 --> 1715.1200000000001
were absolute they were so strong

1712.559 --> 1717.44
that i literally could not consider they

1715.12 --> 1720.0
might be wrong

1717.44 --> 1721.279
because of the strength of it

1720.0 --> 1723.76
now

1721.279 --> 1725.919
i can actually deal with it maybe it is

1723.76 --> 1729.76
also partially because of

1725.919 --> 1729.76
the the way that i've contacted

1729.919 --> 1734.64
connected myself

1732.24 --> 1737.039
even through what i do on my show

1734.64 --> 1740.72
by being so

1737.039 --> 1744.0
really direct and like rage win and

1740.72 --> 1745.3600000000001
being that full open direct

1744.0 --> 1747.679
unhinged

1745.36 --> 1747.6789999999999
self

1748.64 --> 1752.88
with all the feelings and everything

1750.32 --> 1757.6789999999999
without shame

1752.88 --> 1757.679
right it has allowed me to sort of like

1757.919 --> 1763.679
wriggle it bit loose that

1760.48 --> 1767.279
those weird background impulses

1763.679 --> 1769.6000000000001
that tell me exactly like this is how

1767.279 --> 1771.279
how it is very specifically when it's

1769.6 --> 1773.4399999999998
only like

1771.279 --> 1775.919
one option it's like

1773.44 --> 1778.0
this is the one i choose from all the

1775.919 --> 1780.72
possibilities

1778.0 --> 1785.039
that this could lead to but

1780.72 --> 1787.279
i don't need to choose within all those

1785.039 --> 1789.12
possibilities

1787.279 --> 1791.84
right

1789.12 --> 1795.84
i just it's like this neurosis of like

1791.84 --> 1795.84
it has to be like this

1796.24 --> 1801.279
and i used that

1797.919 --> 1804.7990000000002
way in my past 20 years ago

1801.279 --> 1804.799
to help me survive

1805.76 --> 1810.08
so it is there for a reason but it's

1807.679 --> 1812.24
also obstructive and i'm working through

1810.08 --> 1812.24
it

1813.36 --> 1818.0
i have no idea if you guys can follow

1815.679 --> 1820.0
what i'm talking about i'm sure somebody

1818.0 --> 1823.6
out there actually understands what i'm

1820.0 --> 1826.559
talking about beside myself

1823.6 --> 1829.4399999999998
it's hard to find people in my chat that

1826.559 --> 1829.44
actually get it

1830.24 --> 1835.6
although yeah some of you do

1832.88 --> 1837.279
pjc net hello you would be one of the

1835.6 --> 1839.4399999999998
people

1837.279 --> 1842.08
tony whitcomb tends to really get that

1839.44 --> 1842.0800000000002
sort of thing

1846.159 --> 1850.88
no metal slugs cockatiel gamma is not

1848.64 --> 1853.919
third in line

1850.88 --> 1856.0800000000002
it says it's a spectrum

1853.919 --> 1859.279
array

1856.08 --> 1861.84
of character within sexual social

1859.279 --> 1861.84
hierarchy

1862.159 --> 1870.7600000000002
and gamma is not

1864.88 --> 1870.7600000000002
ain't bad it is bad it sucks

1886.399 --> 1892.4399999999998
social club what the [ __ ] are you

1889.039 --> 1892.44
talking about

1894.64 --> 1896.96
why

1898.08 --> 1901.4399999999998
i do my own walking

1902.24 --> 1907.1200000000001
if i'm gonna walk

1904.72 --> 1910.519
i want it to be with somebody that i

1907.12 --> 1910.5189999999998
really like

1926.08 --> 1929.519
yeah that mega slip metal slugs okay i

1928.799 --> 1930.32
know

1929.519 --> 1934.24
like

1930.32 --> 1937.2
the word gamma and beta and alpha it's

1934.24 --> 1940.96
being highly overused and it's like

1937.2 --> 1942.72
trickled down into [ __ ] phil that also

1940.96 --> 1944.08
think they know what the [ __ ] they're

1942.72 --> 1945.1200000000001
saying now

1944.08 --> 1948.08
yeah

1945.12 --> 1950.799
so unfortunately it is spread to

1948.08 --> 1953.4399999999998
retardation ville

1950.799 --> 1956.08
yeah i agree it's being overused and

1953.44 --> 1957.679
people that use it that obviously don't

1956.08 --> 1960.559
know what the [ __ ] they're talking about

1957.679 --> 1962.159
makes it annoying i try to avoid doing

1960.559 --> 1963.9189999999999
that

1962.159 --> 1967.8400000000001
right

1963.919 --> 1970.88
but i assure you that the origin

1967.84 --> 1974.72
of those words and like the meaning of

1970.88 --> 1977.72
it all is very well worked out and it is

1974.72 --> 1977.72
correct

1988.0 --> 1991.0
beating

1992.31 --> 1995.3799999999999
[Music]

1998.06 --> 2002.1699999999998
[Music]

2003.2 --> 2006.799
a beta is actually good

2008.399 --> 2014.08
betas are great

2011.12 --> 2016.559
i have beta timing a lot of it

2014.08 --> 2019.84
i might be like a fundamental beta it's

2016.559 --> 2019.84
just that

2021.919 --> 2028.7990000000002
other than like the structural build up

2025.44 --> 2031.679
like how i am very good secondary it's

2028.799 --> 2033.6
like i become like three times more if i

2031.679 --> 2035.279
am actually connecting up to somebody

2033.6 --> 2038.48
else

2035.279 --> 2041.84
and i can like ride on their power even

2038.48 --> 2044.3990000000001
it's like a mega beta okay

2041.84 --> 2048.399
that's something i have

2044.399 --> 2051.52
but i'm not like a typical beta

2048.399 --> 2055.919
i'm actually like

2051.52 --> 2055.919
mentally i'm much more delta really

2059.119 --> 2064.639
but but i have like i have just elements

2062.0 --> 2067.76
of all these traits i have all of it

2064.639 --> 2069.839
i've got alpha too i all have it all i

2067.76 --> 2072.079
got it all it's just that

2069.839 --> 2074.399
what is going to be my fallback position

2072.079 --> 2076.5600000000004
like in a shock moment right that's

2074.399 --> 2078.159
really the thing that

2076.56 --> 2081.359
determines

2078.159 --> 2084.079
what your real core is i would probably

2081.359 --> 2086.56
be beta it's like oh

2084.079 --> 2089.8390000000004
where am i what am i doing how can i

2086.56 --> 2089.839
help you

2095.919 --> 2098.919
right

2102.27 --> 2105.34
[Music]

2115.119 --> 2120.6400000000003
right that's right if somebody calls you

2117.839 --> 2123.44
a gamma then ask them to explain

2120.64 --> 2125.2
which traits

2123.44 --> 2127.359
about you

2125.2 --> 2128.8799999999997
is gamma

2127.359 --> 2130.48
there's a great likelihood they don't

2128.88 --> 2133.28
even know they don't even know what

2130.48 --> 2133.28
they're talking about

2135.28 --> 2140.88
right it's just like a lot of ballers

2138.64 --> 2142.96
they think they know it but if you then

2140.88 --> 2146.4
test their knowledge they don't actually

2142.96 --> 2146.4
know what they're talking about

2153.599 --> 2158.4
right yeah no i but i did agree with

2155.44 --> 2161.119
that metal slug coca too it's just that

2158.4 --> 2163.44
in general and dumb people saying you're

2161.119 --> 2164.8
a gamma you're this or a beta yeah they

2163.44 --> 2166.7200000000003
don't know what the [ __ ] they're talking

2164.8 --> 2169.3590000000004
about but that's not just using that

2166.72 --> 2171.839
that's usually everything they don't

2169.359 --> 2173.52
know what the [ __ ] they're talking about

2171.839 --> 2175.7599999999998
right that's the problem not that

2173.52 --> 2177.68
they're using that vernacular it's just

2175.76 --> 2179.119
that they in general don't know what the

2177.68 --> 2180.48
[ __ ] they're talking about and they're

2179.119 --> 2183.2000000000003
just

2180.48 --> 2183.2
pretending

2184.8 --> 2189.3590000000004
i don't use those words lightly

2191.2 --> 2197.04
i mean even if i am spotting like the

2194.24 --> 2197.04
the first

2197.52 --> 2201.359
the first

2198.56 --> 2203.44
signs of gamma behavior in somebody i'm

2201.359 --> 2205.119
not just gonna like straight out call so

2203.44 --> 2206.56
many a gamma you know why because

2205.119 --> 2209.359
usually when you do that they

2206.56 --> 2212.0789999999997
immediately become that gamma

2209.359 --> 2214.72
and then ruin the situation which in

2212.079 --> 2217.2000000000003
general something you want to avoid

2214.72 --> 2220.16
so usually kind of let them slowly build

2217.2 --> 2223.2799999999997
up and if they don't then stop their own

2220.16 --> 2225.1189999999997
gamma tendencies

2223.28 --> 2226.7200000000003
then i'll start calling them out for

2225.119 --> 2229.52
being a gamma

2226.72 --> 2232.0
not while they're just

2229.52 --> 2235.52
showing gamma tendencies is no use they

2232.0 --> 2235.52
will just become it then

2236.079 --> 2239.8
and ruin the situation

2245.44 --> 2251.04
right you got to give them a chance

2248.079 --> 2254.8390000000004
to recognize those traits and let it go

2251.04 --> 2256.4
if they have that discipline which they

2254.839 --> 2260.48
should

2256.4 --> 2262.0
they absolutely should have that

2260.48 --> 2264.8
gammas

2262.0 --> 2267.2
it's a it's a hell being a gamma

2264.8 --> 2269.119
you can crawl out of it but it requires

2267.2 --> 2271.359
discipline

2269.119 --> 2272.56
you have to recognize the traits that

2271.359 --> 2275.44
you have

2272.56 --> 2277.44
and then deal with them as they happen

2275.44 --> 2279.599
and make sure they don't start

2277.44 --> 2283.7200000000003
dominating you making you effectively

2279.599 --> 2283.7200000000003
possessed by that demon

2284.24 --> 2288.72
so you got to give somebody that has

2286.0 --> 2291.599
gamma impulses a chance

2288.72 --> 2294.0
to overcome them to break through them

2291.599 --> 2295.28
you can't just immediately start calling

2294.0 --> 2296.839
them a gamma

2295.28 --> 2298.5600000000004
because then you

2296.839 --> 2302.16
only

2298.56 --> 2304.72
you only strike the lucifer and then you

2302.16 --> 2307.7599999999998
got it you got it full right that's what

2304.72 --> 2310.0
you want to avoid everybody else

2307.76 --> 2313.28
so don't just immediately call out a

2310.0 --> 2315.28
gamma with the first signs

2313.28 --> 2317.8390000000004
give them a chance

2315.28 --> 2319.8390000000004
to recognize those impulses themselves

2317.839 --> 2323.52
including like through your you can

2319.839 --> 2325.2
express like i'm not approving of this

2323.52 --> 2327.359
don't just

2325.2 --> 2329.4399999999996
right give them a chance

2327.359 --> 2331.68
it's tough being a gamma and and

2329.44 --> 2335.68
especially trying to crawl out of that

2331.68 --> 2335.68
it's very tough so give them a chance

2336.56 --> 2341.68
right but if they don't take that chance

2340.079 --> 2343.599
then

2341.68 --> 2345.7599999999998
three grounds

2343.599 --> 2347.92
can do it however you like

2345.76 --> 2349.6800000000003
and you'll have the more power for it

2347.92 --> 2353.2000000000003
because you did actually give them a

2349.68 --> 2356.72
chance if you don't give them a chance

2353.2 --> 2356.72
that's actually kind of gamma

2361.359 --> 2364.64
right so there's that

2365.119 --> 2370.48
what exactly is a gamma tendency

2368.8 --> 2372.079
gammas

2370.48 --> 2373.76
want to

2372.079 --> 2375.119
overpower you

2373.76 --> 2377.0400000000004
dominate you

2375.119 --> 2380.1600000000003
break you down

2377.04 --> 2382.72
they're not constructive thinkers

2380.16 --> 2386.48
they only want to basically quickly

2382.72 --> 2388.16
climb up a pile and be the number one in

2386.48 --> 2391.76
that moment

2388.16 --> 2392.64
they're very naturally short-sighted

2391.76 --> 2395.6800000000003
and

2392.64 --> 2396.72
their intellectual range they usually

2395.68 --> 2398.16
use

2396.72 --> 2400.8799999999997
politically

2398.16 --> 2405.2
they don't actually care

2400.88 --> 2405.2000000000003
because they only care about dominating

2405.44 --> 2411.119
they just want to be the number one guy

2408.96 --> 2414.7200000000003
even though they don't deserve it

2411.119 --> 2417.599
so they try to like force that

2414.72 --> 2419.839
basically yeah intimidate or manipulate

2417.599 --> 2422.2400000000002
however they can to make people

2419.839 --> 2424.72
fall in line to them because they want

2422.24 --> 2425.7599999999998
to naturally be the alpha but they're

2424.72 --> 2428.0789999999997
not

2425.76 --> 2430.48
they don't have that

2428.079 --> 2435.48
so they got to fake it and they really

2430.48 --> 2435.48
want to that's what that demon wants to

2456.24 --> 2461.52
i don't know what the hell you're

2458.319 --> 2464.0
reading from basic cheese but that's not

2461.52 --> 2467.0
the definition of gamma that i've heard

2464.0 --> 2467.0
of

2471.28 --> 2474.96
i did where are you getting that from

2476.16 --> 2479.56
that's not

2486.319 --> 2491.7599999999998
can you post my definition no

2489.44 --> 2494.7200000000003
i get my definition

2491.76 --> 2496.079
through owen benjamin through vox day

2494.72 --> 2499.2799999999997
box day

2496.079 --> 2499.28
wrote the book

2502.079 --> 2508.119
he

2503.119 --> 2508.119
if yeah he created the convention

2508.4 --> 2513.6800000000003
and i yeah i have just explained traits

2511.28 --> 2514.8
i get how to explain

2513.68 --> 2518.8799999999997
the whole

2514.8 --> 2520.8
sexual social hierarchy is very suitable

2518.88 --> 2524.079
for

2520.8 --> 2526.319
like personal explanation right it is

2524.079 --> 2529.3590000000004
not something that you just put down in

2526.319 --> 2531.839
a piece of text you explain it you

2529.359 --> 2536.0
give examples of situations and how

2531.839 --> 2537.839
people react in order to make you see

2536.0 --> 2541.68
that's the way to communicate it the

2537.839 --> 2541.68
best that's how i learned to get it

2548.079 --> 2552.0
okay

2549.28 --> 2554.1600000000003
yeah you're just a troll and that

2552.0 --> 2556.079
data

2554.16 --> 2559.04
i don't know even where you the hell you

2556.079 --> 2559.04
got that [ __ ]

2560.8 --> 2566.319
yeah now there's an example of a gamma

2564.079 --> 2569.04
see he doesn't care about the

2566.319 --> 2572.8
information he's just there

2569.04 --> 2575.52
using information politically

2572.8 --> 2577.04
as a sec just as a tool he doesn't care

2575.52 --> 2581.04
about it

2577.04 --> 2585.2799999999997
just to start ramming me down that's

2581.04 --> 2585.2799999999997
what the gamma does every single time

2587.76 --> 2593.599
they want to be on top more than they

2590.64 --> 2595.5989999999997
care for truth or information in general

2593.599 --> 2597.3590000000004
and knowledge and skill development in

2595.599 --> 2600.76
anything

2597.359 --> 2600.7599999999998
they're in hell

2616.16 --> 2618.64
yeah accordzilla

2617.76 --> 2622.1600000000003
it's

2618.64 --> 2622.16
it's a gamma that's what they do

2622.64 --> 2627.68
like especially if you get it right

2625.839 --> 2629.839
because they don't want to be known you

2627.68 --> 2632.319
see gammas

2629.839 --> 2634.64
don't want to be known they want to be

2632.319 --> 2637.2
the ultimate mystic they want to be the

2634.64 --> 2640.0
greatest mystery in the world

2637.2 --> 2642.72
because that's power to them not being

2640.0 --> 2644.56
understood is power to them so if you

2642.72 --> 2646.64
actually understand them then they

2644.56 --> 2649.359
suddenly feel vulnerable they don't want

2646.64 --> 2652.72
to feel vulnerable they want to feel

2649.359 --> 2652.72
like that secret king

2653.119 --> 2659.04
the only way to achieve that is by being

2656.079 --> 2660.6400000000003
the joker the unknown

2659.04 --> 2662.96
anonymous

2660.64 --> 2664.56
powerful all-knowing person that nobody

2662.96 --> 2666.4
knows who they are so they don't know

2664.56 --> 2667.7599999999998
any weakness about them so they can have

2666.4 --> 2670.319
their full

2667.76 --> 2672.96
power abuse without any consequences

2670.319 --> 2676.44
that is what they long for that's what a

2672.96 --> 2676.44
gamma seeks

2676.64 --> 2680.64
are all anti-flurries gamma

2684.16 --> 2688.319
most of them yeah i'd say

2686.8 --> 2690.96
90

2688.319 --> 2690.96
95

2691.52 --> 2695.92
some of them are

2693.2 --> 2698.16
kind of just really delusional deltas

2695.92 --> 2698.16
though

2699.92 --> 2705.28
but yeah the weird thing is is that

2702.4 --> 2708.1600000000003
gammas can transform themselves into

2705.28 --> 2710.079
deltas which is i already talked about

2708.16 --> 2712.72
how difficult that is

2710.079 --> 2715.119
because you constantly have to like

2712.72 --> 2717.839
take care of the bad impulses

2715.119 --> 2719.599
and then you can be a

2717.839 --> 2722.319
it's very hard

2719.599 --> 2724.319
and it's not difficult to fall back into

2722.319 --> 2727.04
being a gamma again it happens

2724.319 --> 2728.48
occasionally if you have overcome it

2727.04 --> 2731.2799999999997
even

2728.48 --> 2733.359
it's always gonna remind you like oh did

2731.28 --> 2734.96
you did you remember that you actually

2733.359 --> 2738.16
used to be a gamma

2734.96 --> 2738.16
very painful

2742.56 --> 2749.68
but yeah most anti-flat earthers are

2745.52 --> 2753.56
like raging obsessed gammas obsessed

2749.68 --> 2753.56
total hundred percent

2766.88 --> 2770.0
hey seeking star wars

2771.04 --> 2774.8
circle jerk yeah it's just this whining

2773.76 --> 2777.3590000000004
gamma

2774.8 --> 2781.52
that does that wants to

2777.359 --> 2783.2
not have the definition of gamma b

2781.52 --> 2784.8
understood

2783.2 --> 2787.52
and recognized

2784.8 --> 2791.04
because then he feels recognized that's

2787.52 --> 2791.04
why he's making sock accounts

2792.16 --> 2796.92
to keep trying to hammer the same point

2807.28 --> 2811.3590000000004
why try to pitch in all your

2809.52 --> 2814.56
what do you mean

2811.359 --> 2816.88
it's spirit mechanics it's not

2814.56 --> 2819.839
this is not a box

2816.88 --> 2822.319
convention that is artificially created

2819.839 --> 2823.92
metal slugs cockatoo

2822.319 --> 2826.0
it's

2823.92 --> 2829.119
just because there's a latin word tied

2826.0 --> 2832.24
into it doesn't mean that it's not real

2829.119 --> 2834.6400000000003
it is real it is all based on real

2832.24 --> 2838.0
behavior patterns

2834.64 --> 2838.0
it's actually real

2839.92 --> 2844.88
and the more you realize that

2843.68 --> 2848.5589999999997
the more

2844.88 --> 2851.359
power you will have over yourself even

2848.559 --> 2853.2000000000003
if you don't take it serious

2851.359 --> 2857.04
you're going to

2853.2 --> 2859.359
slide to your pattern that you like and

2857.04 --> 2862.4
your subconscious will have control

2859.359 --> 2862.4
that's how it happens

2863.44 --> 2869.28
so unless you actually understand that

2865.76 --> 2869.28
it is very relevant

2871.2 --> 2876.96
then yeah

2873.44 --> 2881.2000000000003
if you understand it's relevant then

2876.96 --> 2884.079
then you can do something about it

2881.2 --> 2885.9199999999996
you can work on yourself much better

2884.079 --> 2889.3590000000004
because you understand the impulses you

2885.92 --> 2892.64
understand how your impulses correlate

2889.359 --> 2894.4
or like affect other people's impulses

2892.64 --> 2895.2
in their state

2894.4 --> 2898.319
right

2895.2 --> 2900.96
is like this really complicated social

2898.319 --> 2903.92
chess game in the spirit realm that's

2900.96 --> 2905.839
just always happening

2903.92 --> 2908.7200000000003
but people

2905.839 --> 2911.68
don't really even need to be conscious

2908.72 --> 2913.52
about it in order to have it function

2911.68 --> 2915.7599999999998
because it just kind of works as an

2913.52 --> 2919.28
instinct it's

2915.76 --> 2919.28
part of being human you could say

2920.0 --> 2924.72
so you can function without

2921.92 --> 2926.8
understanding it but if you do

2924.72 --> 2930.72
understand it

2926.8 --> 2930.7200000000003
you can it helps a lot

2931.04 --> 2935.92
because you can just

2933.68 --> 2938.3999999999996
yeah you can much better improve

2935.92 --> 2938.4
yourself

2938.64 --> 2943.44
by recognizing all the typical traits

2941.44 --> 2945.92
and impulses

2943.44 --> 2947.76
and yeah the ones that are just terrible

2945.92 --> 2950.079
and not good for your character or your

2947.76 --> 2952.2400000000002
image nip them in the butt but you have

2950.079 --> 2954.559
to first take it all serious and

2952.24 --> 2956.9599999999996
understand that it's not just some

2954.559 --> 2959.6800000000003
random convention that people made up

2956.96 --> 2962.16
like different gender [ __ ] which is

2959.68 --> 2963.04
complete nonsense right that's just made

2962.16 --> 2966.16
up

2963.04 --> 2968.079
social sexual hierarchy alpha beta

2966.16 --> 2971.68
gamma delta

2968.079 --> 2975.2000000000003
etc that's not just made up

2971.68 --> 2977.9199999999996
those are very specific traits

2975.2 --> 2977.9199999999996
combined

2978.079 --> 2983.92
that just really happen to manifest like

2980.96 --> 2987.44
that they work in a certain way and that

2983.92 --> 2987.44
working is described

2995.839 --> 3000.0
way to get more greek letters latin gree

2998.8 --> 3003.2400000000002
yeah sure

3000.0 --> 3003.24
who cares

[Music]

3015.599 --> 3019.3590000000004
hey you're an arena called wumbo

3020.16 --> 3023.16
okay

3027.839 --> 3033.0789999999997
they're made of ideals no they're not

3100.96 --> 3104.159
[Music]

3115.44 --> 3118.4
all right

3116.8 --> 3121.8390000000004
so i guess that

3118.4 --> 3121.839
you didn't want to talk about it

3122.88 --> 3126.559
fine you don't have to talk about it i

3124.96 --> 3128.319
talked about it though

3126.559 --> 3130.48
because i didn't want to talk about

3128.319 --> 3132.88
brown sauce

3130.48 --> 3136.0
you get it

3132.88 --> 3139.2000000000003
because brown sauce is lame

3136.0 --> 3142.559
it's not a subject

3139.2 --> 3144.7999999999997
that's what 60 iq numpties talk about

3142.559 --> 3146.8
because they're bored

3144.8 --> 3148.559
and they don't have anything to do in

3146.8 --> 3151.2000000000003
their lives

3148.559 --> 3153.76
sorry about that

3151.2 --> 3155.68
yeah so i'm talking about social sexual

3153.76 --> 3158.7200000000003
hierarchy and internal psychology

3155.68 --> 3161.2
instead which is actually productive

3158.72 --> 3163.839
and they're very helpful if you get it

3161.2 --> 3167.839
if you accept that it's actually based

3163.839 --> 3167.839
on real things and works

3169.13 --> 3172.289
[Music]

3200.16 --> 3204.16
no you don't do that do you

3202.319 --> 3206.5589999999997
well i guess that you've never been a

3204.16 --> 3211.2
teenager then

3206.559 --> 3211.2000000000003
because i didn't have these types of

3211.52 --> 3216.48
social sexual hierarchy type knowledge i

3214.4 --> 3218.96
didn't have that knowledge

3216.48 --> 3221.04
but pretty much from

3218.96 --> 3223.599
that i was eight

3221.04 --> 3227.52
up until

3223.599 --> 3231.28
like 17 that was always on my mind i

3227.52 --> 3234.24
absolutely cared young men

3231.28 --> 3236.3190000000004
should care about that because it

3234.24 --> 3238.64
matters a lot as to what you can

3236.319 --> 3240.96
actually achieve in life

3238.64 --> 3243.5989999999997
even what type of female you could score

3240.96 --> 3245.76
to procreate with yeah

3243.599 --> 3247.599
it freaking matters

3245.76 --> 3250.7200000000003
if it doesn't matter to you that's

3247.599 --> 3252.1600000000003
because you're probably very low

3250.72 --> 3254.0789999999997
on the list

3252.16 --> 3255.359
and you know it but you don't want to

3254.079 --> 3257.52
know it so you don't want to have

3255.359 --> 3260.48
anything to do with it anymore so you

3257.52 --> 3262.96
imagine how you're above it all

3260.48 --> 3265.04
yeah yeah i know everything about that

3262.96 --> 3267.76
i've done that

3265.04 --> 3270.24
i have done that because i was not

3267.76 --> 3272.0
freaking high on that list i can tell

3270.24 --> 3275.2
you as a youngster

3272.0 --> 3278.0
because i was just full of like sorrow

3275.2 --> 3278.96
and self-doubt and self-loathing and

3278.0 --> 3282.72
[ __ ]

3278.96 --> 3282.7200000000003
it's really not helpful

3283.28 --> 3287.52
right

3284.799 --> 3290.48
at the fight very hard

3287.52 --> 3294.16
to get that get rid of that

3290.48 --> 3294.16
very very it's been hell

3300.0 --> 3306.72
hahaha so buddy you're so funny holy

3303.92 --> 3309.839
moly it's so funny and you got it wrong

3306.72 --> 3310.9599999999996
you [ __ ] dumbass

3309.839 --> 3313.7599999999998
yeah

3310.96 --> 3315.76
yeah nathan is kind of an alpha or at

3313.76 --> 3318.2400000000002
least he is in the show that's his

3315.76 --> 3320.6400000000003
position and he does it very well

3318.24 --> 3323.359
i don't think as a person nathan is an

3320.64 --> 3324.48
alpha i don't think so

3323.359 --> 3328.0789999999997
yeah

3324.48 --> 3329.599
but on his show i'm not a gamma you

3328.079 --> 3332.88
[ __ ]

3329.599 --> 3335.599
i'm a freaking beta and you know it

3332.88 --> 3337.2000000000003
i'm always supporting always enhancing

3335.599 --> 3339.76
always

3337.2 --> 3344.0
trying to add knowledge

3339.76 --> 3348.599
and insight every time yeah a gamma does

3344.0 --> 3348.599
the opposite you numpty [ __ ]

3360.079 --> 3364.799
i mean even as baldwin i'm not a gamma

3362.48 --> 3364.799
okay

3366.4 --> 3371.04
nathan fits my idea of again well

3369.119 --> 3373.04
dude maybe in his

3371.04 --> 3374.4
own life

3373.04 --> 3377.599
a little

3374.4 --> 3379.6800000000003
but he also is learning he's smart

3377.599 --> 3381.76
so i think that if nathan would be

3379.68 --> 3385.44
declared a gamma in his own personal

3381.76 --> 3389.2000000000003
life he is absolutely also

3385.44 --> 3389.2000000000003
working on becoming a delta

3389.28 --> 3394.7200000000003
but he probably doesn't want

3391.92 --> 3396.2400000000002
like i'm not gonna call him like a gamma

3394.72 --> 3398.64
or anything

3396.24 --> 3398.64
because

3400.72 --> 3406.319
i

3402.16 --> 3407.839
he doesn't act like that towards me

3406.319 --> 3410.079
and i mean

3407.839 --> 3412.319
when like anti-flat earth or shitty

3410.079 --> 3414.799
trolls are involved and not directly on

3412.319 --> 3417.7599999999998
camera yeah then and i can be a little

3414.799 --> 3420.24
bit nasty gamma too against

3417.76 --> 3422.3190000000004
them specifically

3420.24 --> 3424.5589999999997
so i don't really know for sure with

3422.319 --> 3426.64
nathan i don't think he really is a

3424.559 --> 3429.44
gamma he's just too much in control of

3426.64 --> 3429.44
himself to be

3430.839 --> 3436.0
that's so

3432.64 --> 3436.0
maybe more like is

3436.48 --> 3441.76
like an omega or something

3439.52 --> 3444.24
or

3441.76 --> 3446.48
probably just delta

3444.24 --> 3449.04
i mean this overall attitude is also

3446.48 --> 3451.599
very delta

3449.04 --> 3452.48
cohesive and i i don't know it's it's

3451.599 --> 3455.599
it's

3452.48 --> 3455.599
so pointless to me

3458.24 --> 3461.839
bravo not beta

3462.319 --> 3466.5589999999997
i've

3464.16 --> 3467.68
what is bravo and what's the

3466.559 --> 3469.28
dip

3467.68 --> 3471.52
i thought that was pretty much the same

3469.28 --> 3471.52
thing

3472.799 --> 3477.4
but okay bravo i guess

3498.16 --> 3503.68
there are people that fit in yeah right

3499.839 --> 3506.4
pjc yeah you get it it's because

3503.68 --> 3509.44
it's the social sexual hierarchy it is

3506.4 --> 3511.839
like what physician will you naturally

3509.44 --> 3513.44
attain when like even coming in a group

3511.839 --> 3515.7599999999998
for the first time

3513.44 --> 3518.48
it's the natural alchemy

3515.76 --> 3520.559
of your spirit it's like that's what

3518.48 --> 3522.88
really determines that right

3520.559 --> 3525.28
not like what kind of traits even

3522.88 --> 3528.2400000000002
everything you all have that comes kind

3525.28 --> 3530.48
of secondary

3528.24 --> 3533.5989999999997
like when you really pers yeah although

3530.48 --> 3533.599
it is very telling

3534.0 --> 3540.079
but its most determining factor is like

3537.04 --> 3542.799
what natural position will you attain

3540.079 --> 3544.96
when just entering a group for the first

3542.799 --> 3548.24
time like what

3544.96 --> 3549.92
what will you be among them that really

3548.24 --> 3552.4799999999996
determines

3549.92 --> 3553.6800000000003
whether you're an alpha

3552.48 --> 3557.64
beta

3553.68 --> 3557.64
or gamma or anything

3561.92 --> 3565.04
i think at least

3563.359 --> 3566.96
i don't know i'd love to have a wider

3565.04 --> 3568.4
discussion about it with somebody that

3566.96 --> 3570.559
actually

3568.4 --> 3573.359
knows a little bit more about this

3570.559 --> 3576.48
love to have a discussion about it

3573.359 --> 3577.839
but so far from things that i've heard

3576.48 --> 3580.88
about it

3577.839 --> 3584.68
i think i'm getting it i think i get

3580.88 --> 3584.6800000000003
what how it works

3586.88 --> 3591.92
hey adam price

3588.4 --> 3591.92
i'm lost but i'm waiting what

3596.72 --> 3603.4399999999996
you're a rising sign has the biggest

3600.0 --> 3603.44
influence on this what

3603.839 --> 3608.48
is that astrological seeking star wars

3613.839 --> 3619.16
okay

3616.16 --> 3619.16
interesting

3627.62 --> 3632.68
[Music]

3629.68 --> 3632.68
uh

3651.359 --> 3656.4
right okay mecca's metal slugs those

3654.16 --> 3658.799
what you described there that would be

3656.4 --> 3661.2000000000003
typically delta

3658.799 --> 3661.2
i think

3663.52 --> 3665.7599999999998
right

3666.24 --> 3669.04
i

3666.96 --> 3670.88
and i used to be like that a lot too

3669.04 --> 3673.52
it's just like the first time i might be

3670.88 --> 3674.96
like super expressive and hyper active

3673.52 --> 3678.559
even in like

3674.96 --> 3681.119
like really like heavy [ __ ]

3678.559 --> 3683.76
but good like interesting heavy [ __ ] is

3681.119 --> 3686.079
like there's some higher battle going on

3683.76 --> 3688.7200000000003
i would like roll in all the story with

3686.079 --> 3691.44
full weight

3688.72 --> 3695.7599999999998
and then like after that was over it's

3691.44 --> 3695.76
like damn i i went a bit far

3695.839 --> 3699.2799999999997
and then i'd be like okay i'll just kind

3697.68 --> 3701.44
of shut up now

3699.28 --> 3702.4
unless you want to hear more and yeah

3701.44 --> 3703.599
just

3702.4 --> 3706.4
ask me

3703.599 --> 3708.319
and people usually wouldn't

3706.4 --> 3710.88
and sometimes they would and then i

3708.319 --> 3712.88
would probably have like

3710.88 --> 3714.96
half a lifetime long friends out of

3712.88 --> 3717.039
those people

3714.96 --> 3720.0
it's the people that can actually handle

3717.039 --> 3720.0
me as i am

3720.559 --> 3724.4
i think that

3722.0 --> 3727.28
well my roommate that i really like is

3724.4 --> 3730.079
like one of those people it's extremely

3727.28 --> 3734.7200000000003
rare that's like

3730.079 --> 3734.7200000000003
one in a hundred thousand people

3735.28 --> 3741.2000000000003
and i just have happened to

3738.319 --> 3745.2799999999997
i just have to happen to bump into them

3741.2 --> 3745.2799999999997
or i'm not even gonna know they're there

3766.079 --> 3769.6400000000003
that's yeah

3770.64 --> 3775.68
he gets enlarged in the giant and he

3772.72 --> 3780.359
becomes alpha and yeah

3775.68 --> 3780.359
yeah you get it gordzilla i love it

3810.48 --> 3813.68
code switch

3818.0 --> 3821.76
in what sense

3819.359 --> 3821.7599999999998
as in

3822.319 --> 3829.52
you're like a spiritual shape changer

3824.88 --> 3832.4
like i am which it is kind of what i am

3829.52 --> 3832.4
it's just that i

3833.52 --> 3836.88
yeah don't hide

3837.2 --> 3840.319
don't hide what i am

3841.359 --> 3846.4
like what i am underneath that dynamic

3844.16 --> 3848.8799999999997
range because i can absolutely switch i

3846.4 --> 3850.88
could i could switch

3848.88 --> 3852.4
like

3850.88 --> 3854.1600000000003
yeah it's like

3852.4 --> 3855.839
character act or what do you call the

3854.16 --> 3858.3999999999996
method acting

3855.839 --> 3860.96
i'm a natural method actor

3858.4 --> 3866.119
always have been like i learned to do

3860.96 --> 3866.119
that before i even learn who i am

3866.16 --> 3869.92
i would just be able to like almost like

3868.0 --> 3873.119
a parrot just copy

3869.92 --> 3876.079
like entire behavior not just a mimic

3873.119 --> 3879.48
but like the energy as well i would just

3876.079 --> 3879.48
copy it

3891.92 --> 3898.559
all right but yeah a lot of deltas

3895.039 --> 3900.7200000000003
and gammas have talent for doing that

3898.559 --> 3903.599
it's the gammas that abuse it and it's

3900.72 --> 3905.2
the deltas that are like really careful

3903.599 --> 3907.28
with it

3905.2 --> 3910.16
because they know

3907.28 --> 3911.599
that it can like derail you if you

3910.16 --> 3915.2799999999997
overuse it

3911.599 --> 3915.28
and turn into a gamma

3921.119 --> 3925.28
how fast can be good or bad yeah no it

3923.76 --> 3928.1600000000003
look

3925.28 --> 3930.799
it's not about good or bad it is about

3928.16 --> 3932.8799999999997
effective ineffective

3930.799 --> 3934.319
i mean underneath that all you're still

3932.88 --> 3938.559
a spirit

3934.319 --> 3940.64
you're still a soul with a choice

3938.559 --> 3942.96
for good or evil

3940.64 --> 3942.96
right

3945.68 --> 3952.9199999999996
what is it seeking

3948.0 --> 3952.92
are you anticipating some numpties

3981.44 --> 3987.21
adam's message is self-destructed

3984.319 --> 3990.329
i i didn't see it

3987.21 --> 3990.329
[Music]

3995.21 --> 3998.84
[Music]

4005.76 --> 4007.8390000000004
you

4023.68 --> 4029.2
what what are you talking about i'm

4026.48 --> 4029.2
i don't get it

4030.96 --> 4036.64
what do you mean didn't get ava ryan

4033.68 --> 4036.64
what does that mean

4037.44 --> 4042.28
a variant of what

4039.28 --> 4042.28
dominoid

4063.44 --> 4066.2400000000002
hmm

4064.319 --> 4067.7599999999998
all right yeah metal slug that's funny

4066.24 --> 4069.7599999999998
that you mentioned that metal slugs

4067.76 --> 4072.0
hookah two

4069.76 --> 4073.92
what you're describing there knowing how

4072.0 --> 4075.76
to weave in and out of cliques and

4073.92 --> 4078.64
groups people picking up social

4075.76 --> 4081.44
subtleties like copying yeah that's

4078.64 --> 4082.48
what i'm talking about

4081.44 --> 4085.52
if you

4082.48 --> 4087.44
extend that even further

4085.52 --> 4091.0
then it's like

4087.44 --> 4091.0
character acting

4093.44 --> 4098.4800000000005
because i could do that two levels that

4095.52 --> 4098.48
is pretty extreme

4099.52 --> 4103.279
i mean i would literally just

4101.199 --> 4106.4
impersonate somebody completely

4103.279 --> 4108.64
different and actually believe it and do

4106.4 --> 4112.08
have the attitude

4108.64 --> 4113.6
and even like effect like fake

4112.08 --> 4116.08
background

4113.6 --> 4118.96
history that would still make sense i

4116.08 --> 4121.12
was like too good at it

4118.96 --> 4125.04
that sounds very gamma by the way but it

4121.12 --> 4126.64
just i had that ability early

4125.04 --> 4130.239
bowen yeah

4126.64 --> 4132.799
yeah well bowen is still a

4130.239 --> 4135.2789999999995
proof of that dynamic like it's right

4132.799 --> 4137.199
there it's right there i can literally

4135.279 --> 4139.759
make myself believe something and

4137.199 --> 4140.799
actually believe it

4139.759 --> 4143.6
but it's always going to be

4140.799 --> 4145.12
compartmentalized

4143.6 --> 4147.6
it's just that

4145.12 --> 4150.159
my consciousness will be shifted towards

4147.6 --> 4154.2390000000005
a very specific setup

4150.159 --> 4157.599999999999
that will be my reality temporarily

4154.239 --> 4159.5199999999995
but i still know that outside of that is

4157.6 --> 4161.4400000000005
it's not that

4159.52 --> 4164.080000000001
that's the if that's the factor that i

4161.44 --> 4166.96
really had to train because i didn't

4164.08 --> 4169.759
i didn't have that

4166.96 --> 4172.159
when i would zone into a very specific

4169.759 --> 4173.679
setup basically a presupposition and i

4172.159 --> 4176.48
thought that was true

4173.679 --> 4179.12
then it would be true

4176.48 --> 4181.3589999999995
and i would potentially not snap out of

4179.12 --> 4183.5199999999995
it until somebody recognized like hey

4181.359 --> 4185.359
that makes no sense and then snapped me

4183.52 --> 4187.6
out of it and then it was like really

4185.359 --> 4190.400000000001
shocked like what

4187.6 --> 4190.400000000001
what has happened

4191.92 --> 4198.08
i i don't need others anymore for that

4195.6 --> 4203.84
thank god

4198.08 --> 4203.84
i can just compartmentalize it now

4208.56 --> 4212.159000000001
yeah then you have troubles that's right

4210.159 --> 4215.159
godzilla and i did and i did have

4212.159 --> 4215.159
troubles

4218.88 --> 4221.4400000000005
it's like

4222.4 --> 4226.96
i would be lying

4224.56 --> 4228.400000000001
without even realizing that i would be

4226.96 --> 4233.92
lying

4228.4 --> 4233.92
because i really thought like i was that

4238.08 --> 4243.92
it's like like how can you say that i

4241.04 --> 4245.5199999999995
didn't do these things as this character

4243.92 --> 4247.12
of course this character that i'm

4245.52 --> 4249.4400000000005
playing

4247.12 --> 4251.679
has done these things he can feel it

4249.44 --> 4252.879999999999
right now

4251.679 --> 4254.96
yeah

4252.88 --> 4256.400000000001
i wouldn't say it like that but that's

4254.96 --> 4259.04
now my

4256.4 --> 4261.389999999999
transcription of such a situation

4259.04 --> 4264.4

[Music]

4264.4 --> 4267.36

not

4268.48 --> 4273.839999999999
lying

4270.8 --> 4273.84
it's weird

4274.64 --> 4279.92
and i'm really glad i didn't just

4277.76 --> 4282.08
go out and become like some freaking

4279.92 --> 4285.4
criminal using that i'm really happy

4282.08 --> 4285.4
about it

4305.12 --> 4310.44
yeah dude [ __ ] off with your brown sauce

4307.44 --> 4310.44
man

4327.12 --> 4330.32
okay terminoid

4333.679 --> 4338.88
okay so that supposed project project

4336.48 --> 4342.089999999999
has been discontinued i take it or is

4338.88 --> 4345.189
this just total random inputs

4357.679 --> 4361.6
come on a little sweet

4359.52 --> 4363.92
dude

4361.6 --> 4366.8
i don't get it

4363.92 --> 4368.4800000000005
untitled thumb crew spacex project come

4366.8 --> 4370.400000000001

picture in outer space

4372.159 --> 4375.04
rest in peace

4373.679 --> 4377.76
so

4375.04 --> 4381.28
it was discontinued then

4377.76 --> 4385.84
because rest in peace doesn't really say

4381.28 --> 4388.8
since it's not actually a living entity

4385.84 --> 4388.8
it's a project

4389.6 --> 4395.1990000000005
and i don't know

4391.84 --> 4397.52
i've heard it before that phrase i don't

4395.199 --> 4401.5199999999995
know what happened i don't know if they

4397.52 --> 4405.040000000001
discontinued it i'm gonna take it

4401.52 --> 4405.040000000001
is my comment on it

4408.159 --> 4411.159
why

4415.36 --> 4419.159
did something happen

4428.159 --> 4431.36
all right gordzilla yeah see ya see you

4430.239 --> 4433.199
around

4431.36 --> 4434.799999999999
thanks for popping by uh

4433.199 --> 4437.199
and thanks for like questions and

4434.8 --> 4440.92
comments i do appreciate it when people

4437.199 --> 4440.919999999999
actually make effort

[Music]

4456.48 --> 4460.718999999999
upcoming

4457.76 --> 4462.88
according to imdb

4460.719 --> 4465.52
oh so it's not rest in peace then

4462.88 --> 4465.52
terminoid

4467.44 --> 4472.879999999999
see that's what i mean it's like oh

4470.4 --> 4475.839999999999
this and that rest in peace oh you're

4472.88 --> 4478.56
supposed to get it now oh really

4475.84 --> 4480.64
but it hasn't been discontinued which

4478.56 --> 4483.76
would be the closest association to

4480.64 --> 4485.679
being dead apparently it's still being

4483.76 --> 4487.4400000000005
announced

4485.679 --> 4489.28
so

4487.44 --> 4492.32
where's the article oh it was

4489.28 --> 4494.8
discontinued if you'd have that

4492.32 --> 4497.799999999999
then i'd say yeah rest in peace you're

4494.8 --> 4500.4800000000005
right now it makes sense because it was

4497.8 --> 4503.360000000001
discontinued if it's just rest in peace

4500.48 --> 4504.959999999999
is a random comment like it makes no

4503.36 --> 4507.96
sense man

4504.96 --> 4507.96
cohesion

4508.48 --> 4511.839999999999
make sense

4520.88 --> 4527.04
go out in a place of glory no way

4525.679 --> 4529.52
really

4527.04 --> 4531.679
you think tom cruise is gonna like die

4529.52 --> 4534.159000000001
on the movie set like that

4531.679 --> 4534.159
really

4535.84 --> 4540.56
why would they do that i mean he's like

4537.92 --> 4544.0
a golden goose right now

4540.56 --> 4544.0
like that makes no sense

4544.08 --> 4548.199
this conversation is

4545.199 --> 4548.199
self-destructiveness

4551.36 --> 4555.28
maybe

4552.4 --> 4557.199
i i just really want people to make

4555.28 --> 4559.5199999999995
sense and stop

4557.199 --> 4561.199
blabbering

4559.52 --> 4563.92
like they're

4561.199 --> 4568.719
like they're teenagers in

4563.92 --> 4571.76
school lunch break just bored dribbling

4568.719 --> 4573.92
and making stupid ass comments about

4571.76 --> 4577.04
like tv shows that aren't even

4573.92 --> 4579.36
interesting right i don't want that i

4577.04 --> 4581.679
want you to consider like you're

4579.36 --> 4583.36
actually sitting in class and a teacher

4581.679 --> 4585.28
staring at you if you're paying

4583.36 --> 4586.799999999999
attention

4585.28 --> 4593.0
this is not

4586.8 --> 4593.0
lunch break blabber time you get it

4594.239 --> 4599.919999999999
if you're gonna make a joke it better

4596.719 --> 4602.0
damn well make sense as a joke

4599.92 --> 4605.36
if you're gonna make a point you better

4602.0 --> 4608.76
well damn back it up

4605.36 --> 4608.759999999999
you get it

4609.04 --> 4612.56
otherwise you're going to have a annoyed

4611.36 --> 4614.5599999999995
arwin

4612.56 --> 4616.96
that's going to complain about your

4614.56 --> 4618.8
behavior in my chat and you might think

4616.96 --> 4620.8
that's unreasonable i didn't mean

4618.8 --> 4624.8
anything bad yeah well you're not paying

4620.8 --> 4624.8
attention you're not taking it serious

4625.679 --> 4630.64
just goofing off

4628.0 --> 4632.08
wasting everybody's time then

4630.64 --> 4633.92
don't do that

4632.08 --> 4637.64
don't do that with your time don't do

4633.92 --> 4637.64
that with my time

4637.84 --> 4643.159000000001
make a point

4639.76 --> 4643.159000000001
back it up

4650.08 --> 4653.679
okay

4651.199 --> 4653.678999999999
howard

4655.04 --> 4659.36
i don't know

4656.96 --> 4661.6
maybe the old stephen hawkins

4659.36 --> 4661.599999999999
did

4662.0 --> 4667.12
like

4664.96 --> 4669.92
did like kind of know about flat earth

4667.12 --> 4671.76
and maybe god believed it i don't know

4669.92 --> 4673.76
i think the old stephen hawkins was

4671.76 --> 4676.2390000000005
actually quite a remarkable person in

4673.76 --> 4677.76
many ways

4676.239 --> 4680.799999999999
that new

4677.76 --> 4683.679
replacement wheel puppet figure however

4680.8 --> 4685.1990000000005
and his riding team

4683.679 --> 4688.159
no

4685.199 --> 4688.159
no he was not

4689.199 --> 4695.12
the project was not

4692.88 --> 4698.32
so yeah the old stephen hawking maybe

4695.12 --> 4702.0
but that's such a long time ago

4698.32 --> 4702.0
i'd have to like re-watch

4702.08 --> 4706.96
like some of his lectures and all that

4704.239 --> 4710.32
from when he was still alive to in order

4706.96 --> 4712.56
to like recalibrate

4710.32 --> 4715.04
and figure out like where was he really

4712.56 --> 4716.159000000001
i just have memories like i respected

4715.04 --> 4720.44
that guy

4716.159 --> 4720.44
before the new guy

4729.04 --> 4732.08
the hell

4730.32 --> 4735.48
hello good servant that makes no

4732.08 --> 4735.48
freaking sense

4750.8 --> 4758.76
we lost tom cruise and helium to space

4754.48 --> 4758.759999999999
that is kind of funny i agree

4779.36 --> 4784.4
all right good sir i know you tried it

4781.44 --> 4787.919999999999
just didn't make any sense

4784.4 --> 4792.48
which i guess in a way is kind of funny

4787.92 --> 4792.4800000000005
because it's you trying sorry

4797.52 --> 4802.4800000000005
a little liberty dude hey hey metal

4801.199 --> 4805.919999999999
hey

4802.48 --> 4809.44
hey maybe you should stop trying to tell

4805.92 --> 4812.159
me how to do my show and

4809.44 --> 4813.12
deal with my chat

4812.159 --> 4815.92
huh

4813.12 --> 4818.159
am i not having fun oh you need to point

4815.92 --> 4820.4
that out to me like maybe you should do

4818.159 --> 4822.799999999999
it differently maybe

4820.4 --> 4825.28
you really want to get banned because

4822.8 --> 4827.52
that's what happens to people

4825.28 --> 4832.199
that do that all the time

4827.52 --> 4832.1990000000005
that can never just leave it alone

4832.4 --> 4838.879999999999
yeah that feel like they need to advise

4835.76 --> 4840.96
me on how to do what i do

4838.88 --> 4844.08
yeah i don't need that

4840.96 --> 4847.28
metal slugs cockatiel

4844.08 --> 4850.08
you get it

4847.28 --> 4851.92
i am having fun here and i already said

4850.08 --> 4854.239
if you're going to make a joke it better

4851.92 --> 4855.84
than what makes sense it has to actually

4854.239 --> 4858.159
be funny

4855.84 --> 4860.8
and in this case good servants joke even

4858.159 --> 4862.5599999999995
was funny even though it didn't make any

4860.8 --> 4864.639
sense because

4862.56 --> 4867.6
it was him and he didn't make any sense

4864.639 --> 4869.28
and he was just trying and he is

4867.6 --> 4872.2390000000005
oh every time good servant does

4869.28 --> 4874.5599999999995
something he is always trying to be good

4872.239 --> 4875.839999999999
and so then it's funny because he's not

4874.56 --> 4877.360000000001
a gamma

4875.84 --> 4879.84
if he was just a gamma then it would

4877.36 --> 4882.639
have just annoyed me but he isn't so now

4879.84 --> 4884.400000000001
it is funny you get it no yeah that's

4882.639 --> 4887.8
because you don't understand the social

4884.4 --> 4887.799999999999
sexual hierarchy

4890.08 --> 4893.97
and i did think that the joke about

4892.32 --> 4897.039
helium and

4893.97 --> 4897.039000000001
[Music]

4897.36 --> 4902.239
and tom cruise being lost to space was

4899.92 --> 4906.4
really funny because there's a context

4902.239 --> 4906.4
to that that's kind of blatant because

4906.8 --> 4912.08
he's such a small man

4909.12 --> 4913.76
and he'll even such a light gas and

4912.08 --> 4916.639
it's funny

4913.76 --> 4918.96
i think even he thinks it will be funny

4916.639 --> 4918.96
right

4920.48 --> 4925.839999999999
you thought

4921.76 --> 4925.84
good how was it a dude

4927.04 --> 4934.88
okay ari knuckle wombo

4930.32 --> 4934.88
you thought it was pretty good okay

4940.0 --> 4945.76
yes stephen hawking oh yeah yeah no i

4942.8 --> 4948.08
could call him stephen hawkins

4945.76 --> 4950.2390000000005
yeah i don't even call him hawking i

4948.08 --> 4952.639
call him hawkins

4950.239 --> 4956.4
yeah because i [ __ ] like to say

4952.639 --> 4959.04
hawkins just like dawkins yeah i like to

4956.4 --> 4961.679
say it that way

4959.04 --> 4964.48
when i talk about a guy that's dead and

4961.679 --> 4967.4400000000005
been resurrected into a wheelchair

4964.48 --> 4971.28
propaganda puppet if i want to call him

4967.44 --> 4972.5599999999995
hawkins then i will call him hawkins you

4971.28 --> 4975.12
get it

4972.56 --> 4976.8
because i choose to call him stephen

4975.12 --> 4978.88
hawkins

4976.8 --> 4981.52
because i don't give a [ __ ]

4978.88 --> 4984.08
because it's not even the real person

4981.52 --> 4986.719
if it was the real stephen hawking

4984.08 --> 4988.239
then i would really make sure to like oh

4986.719 --> 4991.28
i have to pronounce it correct because

4988.239 --> 4993.12
this is actually a guy that gives a [ __ ]

4991.28 --> 4995.36
and is really smart

4993.12 --> 4999.8
yeah not that freaking propaganda

4995.36 --> 4999.799999999999
wheelchair puppet thank you

5006.719 --> 5010.8
do you see the joke yes i see the joke

5011.199 --> 5016.919999999999
i think

5012.639 --> 5016.92
i'm not sure anywhere [ __ ]

5047.04 --> 5050.239
hawking

5048.56 --> 5051.6
was mandela

5050.239 --> 5054.159
yeah

5051.6 --> 5054.159000000001
that's right

5054.32 --> 5058.88
but the mandela is all in her mind

5056.56 --> 5061.6
because hawkins

5058.88 --> 5063.6
is the way i want to pronounce it i

5061.6 --> 5067.679
literally just declared i'm going to

5063.6 --> 5070.400000000001
prioritize my mandela affected

5067.679 --> 5072.8
interpretation of his name

5070.4 --> 5076.48
i'm gonna give it priority not because i

5072.8 --> 5078.96
believe it actually is the reality but

5076.48 --> 5081.759999999999
because i choose

5078.96 --> 5084.4800000000005
to not give a [ __ ] i'm just gonna call

5081.76 --> 5087.360000000001
it the mandela affected interpretation

5084.48 --> 5088.959999999999
which is not the real version i just am

5087.36 --> 5093.199
gonna do that

5088.96 --> 5096.08
because i choose to consciously you see

5093.199 --> 5099.678999999999
it's a difference i don't actually think

5096.08 --> 5104.32
oh wait it's not hawkins

5099.679 --> 5107.04
what oh no they manipulated somebody

5104.32 --> 5109.599999999999
again they did it again the matrix has

5107.04 --> 5112.639
changed oh shits

5109.6 --> 5115.360000000001
i can never have control over my life if

5112.639 --> 5117.84
they constantly change

5115.36 --> 5119.759999999999
names of individuals that don't even

5117.84 --> 5122.639
live anymore no

5119.76 --> 5126.76
because i'm not a [ __ ]

5122.639 --> 5126.76
i know what it is

5132.82 --> 5136.0199999999995
[Music]

5137.28 --> 5141.639
yeah howard that's from a cartoon

5142.639 --> 5147.84
i think that also like happened in

5144.56 --> 5150.88
dexter's laboratory

5147.84 --> 5152.08
if i remember correctly

5150.88 --> 5155.08
but it's all

5152.08 --> 5155.08
yeah

5156.28 --> 5159.37
[Music]

5161.92 --> 5165.679
hawkins is the tiniest stranger things i

5164.8 --> 5169.0
know

5165.679 --> 5169.0
i know

5174.8 --> 5180.4800000000005
and i bet that

5176.96 --> 5182.96
stephen king also knows

5180.48 --> 5185.12
he's probably playing around with it i

5182.96 --> 5186.2390000000005
mean i'm very sure that like stephen

5185.12 --> 5188.159
hawk uh

5186.239 --> 5191.04
stephen king

5188.159 --> 5193.599999999999
is very well aware of like the mandela

5191.04 --> 5196.88
effect how that works in the mine

5193.6 --> 5199.04
i'm i'm sure he knows and is like

5196.88 --> 5201.36
like really subtly playing around with

5199.04 --> 5203.44
it in his movie i think he's known for a

5201.36 --> 5205.44
long time just maybe since he even

5203.44 --> 5206.48
started movie making

5205.44 --> 5210.08
i just

5206.48 --> 5214.4
get this feeling he understands it

5210.08 --> 5214.4
how mandela works in the mine

5215.44 --> 5217.919999999999
hawking

5218.159 --> 5220.48
hawking

5218.98 --> 5222.5599999999995
[Music]

5220.48 --> 5225.5599999999995
literally turned for grifting skit will

5222.56 --> 5225.56
really

5226.48 --> 5228.718999999999
huh

5235.679 --> 5239.639
that's weird matthew hall

5252.0 --> 5256.32
i didn't yeah i didn't realize that

5254.719 --> 5258.32
i don't know

5256.32 --> 5259.12
but again to be sure

5258.32 --> 5261.04
like

5259.12 --> 5262.239
if there's something off about stephen

5261.04 --> 5264.4
hawking

5262.239 --> 5267.759999999999
hawking

5264.4 --> 5269.759999999999
the old one i'd have to like watch

5267.76 --> 5272.159000000001
some of the videos where he has lectures

5269.76 --> 5274.0
in order to figure that out like is

5272.159 --> 5274.96
there actually something wrong with this

5274.0 --> 5276.56
guy

5274.96 --> 5279.199
karmically

5276.56 --> 5280.719
other than his disease like is his mind

5279.199 --> 5284.599999999999
wrong

5280.719 --> 5284.6
and he's like his soul

5299.92 --> 5305.32
no no howard i don't want to help you

5302.32 --> 5305.32

interesting show

5355.28 --> 5358.84

5402.159 --> 5407.839999999999
what that refers to

5404.88 --> 5407.84
too bad

5420.32 --> 5425.199
it's actually referencing to a 2006

5423.199 --> 5427.919999999999
mario the hardest level

5425.199 --> 5432.919999999999

5427.92 --> 5432.92
playing it and getting really frustrated

5448.56 --> 5451.1990000000005
right but i think i'm going to run out

5450.08 --> 5454.239

ass

5477.199 --> 5481.28

5479.52 --> 5483.6
it's going to be contrasted to some

5481.28 --> 5486.48
actual information then yeah i'm going

5483.6 --> 5488.639
to just use information as an offense if

5486.48 --> 5491.44
that's what you're going to be doing

5488.639 --> 5494.0
