103.24 --> 107.96
[Music]

105.96 --> 111.53999999999999
very different from the day before

107.96 --> 114.05999999999999
yesterday was it started yeah no it was

111.54 --> 118.02000000000001
overall pretty beautiful

114.06 --> 120.0
the clear sky a bit cold when it got

118.02 --> 121.86
darker

120.0 --> 123.96
and just like little sheep clouds

121.86 --> 126.53999999999999
everywhere but today it's a little bit

123.96 --> 130.56
more gray

126.54 --> 133.459
but still some some seems to be coming

130.56 --> 133.459
through all that

133.92 --> 136.76
but not a lot

138.54 --> 141.62
and it's still dry

142.08 --> 146.74900000000002
right

143.61 --> 146.74900000000002
[Music]

151.739 --> 159.31900000000002
hello LSG first in chat good to see you

154.86 --> 159.31900000000002
hello Adrian Adrian Brown

160.56 --> 163.099
welcome

164.07 --> 172.5
[Music]

166.319 --> 172.5
it is Tuesday the 27th of December 2022

173.459 --> 179.9
last

176.22 --> 179.9
four days of the year

181.739 --> 186.84
next weekend it's gonna be 2023.

189.56 --> 193.25900000000001
[Music]

198.54 --> 206.4
right but yeah I'm starting a bit late

201.659 --> 209.099
because I enjoyed my sleep a lot and I

206.4 --> 211.26000000000002
basically woke up at

209.099 --> 212.76
one o'clock when I would normally start

211.26 --> 215.519
the show

212.76 --> 218.04
so sorry about that I just kind of

215.519 --> 220.5
needed to sleep I had an amazing

218.04 --> 221.64
Christmas dinner yesterday and it was

220.5 --> 225.06
like

221.64 --> 228.42
just very impressive everything because

225.06 --> 232.56
not only were we like connecting good

228.42 --> 235.57999999999998
like me and my dad and my stepmother

232.56 --> 235.58
but like

236.959 --> 242.22
we just connected on a really high level

239.64 --> 245.659
it's like all our interests

242.22 --> 249.12
woke up and all came together like

245.659 --> 252.78
facing the same direction and so we had

249.12 --> 256.16
some really high level talks

252.78 --> 258.9
like a stepmother and me about basically

256.16 --> 261.12
YouTube what I'm doing here how it's

258.9 --> 263.63899999999995
actually really working

261.12 --> 266.22
despite Financial situations out there

263.639 --> 268.74
getting worse and

266.22 --> 271.32000000000005
a bit about her business and what she's

268.74 --> 273.24
facing in there and what my dad is doing

271.32 --> 275.52
and we were all just very much like what

273.24 --> 277.5
are we doing what are we gonna do and

275.52 --> 279.9
what do we do with this world

277.5 --> 282.3
because apparently my stepmother my dad

279.9 --> 286.79999999999995
have been having some conflict

282.3 --> 291.90000000000003
because my dad is well really into

286.8 --> 295.32
like analyzing about the war with Russia

291.9 --> 298.13899999999995
and well my stepmother is just really

295.32 --> 302.04
not into that because she is

298.139 --> 306.259
like a connector so she cannot use such

302.04 --> 306.259
polarization at all in what she does

306.36 --> 309.86
and so my dad is like

311.04 --> 317.58000000000004
moving on basically from it realizing

314.16 --> 319.91900000000004
similar to lessons that I learned like

317.58 --> 324.3
yeah when you constantly dip your face

319.919 --> 327.0
into into some subject then you

324.3 --> 328.5
it seduces you and it basically [ __ ]

327.0 --> 330.36
around with you

328.5 --> 331.86
in your world because now that's all you

330.36 --> 334.139
can think about

331.86 --> 337.02000000000004
and

334.139 --> 338.94
yeah it was just overall very

337.02 --> 341.639
interesting

338.94 --> 345.0
very enlightening

341.639 --> 348.12
and I let my I

345.0 --> 351.3
I shared some you I shared Hammersmith

348.12 --> 353.46
from Gustav Holst with my dad and he had

351.3 --> 356.16
never heard that before

353.46 --> 358.919
so it was really funny because he was

356.16 --> 361.38000000000005
kind of like also looking for music

358.919 --> 363.479
like he just I mean he has music in him

361.38 --> 365.82
and he he's not a guitar teacher anymore

363.479 --> 368.58
but he still has that

365.82 --> 370.44
those skills and the longing and

368.58 --> 374.69899999999996
so I was like hey have you heard of this

370.44 --> 376.199
it's kind of scary but it's not really

374.699 --> 379.22
dark it's

376.199 --> 383.639
and like there's some real

379.22 --> 386.699
interesting psychological depth to

383.639 --> 389.46000000000004
an assistant to what what he did in that

386.699 --> 391.91900000000004
song specifically but also other works

389.46 --> 393.9
and so I yeah let him hear the song he

391.919 --> 396.419
was like whoa

393.9 --> 399.59999999999997
he totally got it

396.419 --> 401.52
and he was like yeah so I don't know

399.6 --> 405.66
maybe I sent him on some

401.52 --> 408.9
music Discovery tour with that

405.66 --> 411.24
but it was just overall great dude my

408.9 --> 412.5
stepmother gave me a whole SWAT of

411.24 --> 415.58
supplements

412.5 --> 415.58
then it's like

417.24 --> 421.039
yeah Santa came by

421.44 --> 425.46
yo she she got me like

423.84 --> 426.919
a big

425.46 --> 429.84
accident

426.919 --> 432.29999999999995
a stock some team

429.84 --> 435.06
thing which like if you buy that in the

432.3 --> 436.56
store that's like 60 Euros

435.06 --> 438.84
holy [ __ ]

436.56 --> 442.56
and spirulina

438.84 --> 444.9
fish oil vitamin C

442.56 --> 447.78000000000003
B12

444.9 --> 450.06
and this is like something new that I

447.78 --> 452.58
don't know ashwagandha

450.06 --> 454.08
I don't know a lot about it so I'm not

452.58 --> 456.12
like oh yeah of course I'm immediately

454.08 --> 456.96
using that I need to figure out what

456.12 --> 458.819
that is

456.96 --> 461.06
you don't know a little bit more about

458.819 --> 461.06
it

461.4 --> 463.75899999999996
out

468.479 --> 472.039
so that's basically

472.38 --> 477.479
all of this like for them yeah they have

475.68 --> 481.08
a lot of that because they also sell

477.479 --> 482.699
that people literally come there also

481.08 --> 485.88
for those products because they're

482.699 --> 488.96000000000004
really good I mean I know what I'm using

485.88 --> 491.21999999999997
but all this does save me a lot of cost

488.96 --> 494.099
in the coming year

491.22 --> 496.639
I mean that package overall could save

494.099 --> 496.639
me like

498.36 --> 504.44
yeah two hundred dollars

501.66 --> 504.44
or more

509.22 --> 515.399
and it was just it's always nice

512.76 --> 518.8199999999999
because I don't ask for it

515.399 --> 521.24
she just does that anyway yeah I had a

518.82 --> 521.24
great time

521.399 --> 524.24
ah

527.1 --> 530.82
I laid some cards again at the end of

529.98 --> 533.519
the dinner

530.82 --> 536.44
and that was really interesting

533.519 --> 539.499
how it all started to fit again

536.44 --> 539.499
[Music]

546.6 --> 550.4590000000001
let's see where is that thing

563.22 --> 565.399
um

565.62 --> 568.4590000000001
hello

572.16 --> 576.14
click it from the email again

604.14 --> 607.279
there you go

614.95 --> 618.089
[Music]

624.42 --> 627.3199999999999
wait what

628.08 --> 630.6800000000001
right

638.22 --> 642.38
so yeah I got this one

651.42 --> 655.3389999999999
hey steamy trailer good to see you

656.7 --> 661.7
all right so that's

658.68 --> 661.6999999999999
a cat

662.16 --> 669.48
which apparently is like

665.519 --> 670.92
a form of spirit in which him

669.48 --> 675.0600000000001
kind of at

670.92 --> 677.2199999999999
just yeah I mean I can't say I disagree

675.06 --> 680.88
then he

677.22 --> 683.279
a pass card eight of water and then a

680.88 --> 685.68
future or present card

683.279 --> 689.88
the Night of Fire

685.68 --> 692.519
I mean when you read all into that

689.88 --> 695.06
it's overall just about my own

692.519 --> 695.0600000000001
transformation

695.279 --> 701.7
and how I am at yeah letting old

698.399 --> 704.16
Darkness from my past go more and more

701.7 --> 707.22
it's like it's the aid of waters like

704.16 --> 709.74
abandoning these cups

707.22 --> 712.14
that were distracting while rising to

709.74 --> 713.5790000000001
the surface and the Fire Knight is

712.14 --> 715.8199999999999
basically well that's basically what I'm

713.579 --> 715.8199999999999
doing

715.98 --> 723.62
and in that sense Nathan Oakley in what

718.86 --> 723.62
he does is also a fire Knight

724.56 --> 728.64
anyway

726.12 --> 732.32
I thought

728.64 --> 732.3199999999999
I'd share that with you guys

732.839 --> 737.0600000000001
it's funny because I posted it in master

735.36 --> 740.76
B yesterday

737.06 --> 742.92
and then Brian basically gave me a

740.76 --> 746.399
correct analysis about it

742.92 --> 749.519
like a rough summarization of it

746.399 --> 754.079
I apparently he knew how to look that up

749.519 --> 756.72
or he actually just knows

754.079 --> 759.3199999999999
how card laying works and that would be

756.72 --> 759.32
weirder even

760.44 --> 765.7790000000001
because I didn't say anything I just

763.019 --> 768.66
showed him those pictures

765.779 --> 770.22
and then he's like oh so it's like you

768.66 --> 771.6
made a mistake

770.22 --> 776.399
and

771.6 --> 780.9590000000001
you're unapologetically correcting it

776.399 --> 783.06
yeah well that is one way of saying that

780.959 --> 784.8599999999999
so that was very impressive from Brian

783.06 --> 786.8
Brian's logic

784.86 --> 789.57
anyway

786.8 --> 791.0999999999999
hey Stevie traveler good to see you

789.57 --> 794.1600000000001

811.44 --> 813.98
all right

816.34 --> 818.39

foreign

818.39 --> 837.54
[Music]

834.72 --> 841.639
so yeah our Christmas dinner

837.54 --> 841.639
was black and sour chicken

843.66 --> 848.1
which apparently that this was a real

846.48 --> 851.22
surprise because I didn't know that at

848.1 --> 854.0400000000001
all I basically suggested to my dad

851.22 --> 856.0790000000001
like a week ago like hey could you make

854.04 --> 858.24
like for Christmas maybe like

856.079 --> 860.279
black sour chicken

858.24 --> 862.5
because that's like really delicious and

860.279 --> 864.66
my dad knows how to make it excellent

862.5 --> 866.639
always has

864.66 --> 869.579
but I've hadn't had that in a long time

866.639 --> 871.6800000000001
and then well my dad did it and but no

869.579 --> 874.3199999999999
Christmas he told me that apparently

871.68 --> 876.8389999999999
that's like the traditional Christmas

874.32 --> 882.0600000000001
dinner in Indonesia

876.839 --> 885.139
what oh okay I didn't know that

882.06 --> 885.1389999999999
it was really funny

886.32 --> 892.98
but yeah it was delicious absolutely

888.779 --> 898.26
delicious and black sour chicken

892.98 --> 900.839
it's like marinated in stuff that has

898.26 --> 904.22
red wine with it that's like the core of

900.839 --> 904.22
it that's what makes it dark

905.22 --> 909.44
and yeah I had some uh

910.139 --> 917.88
baked potatoes with rosemary next to

913.8 --> 919.9799999999999
that and some green beans

917.88 --> 923.459
ah

919.98 --> 925.98
some Tutti Frutti just a little like

923.459 --> 927.5999999999999
next with these with the black sour

925.98 --> 929.339
chicken because that like you're

927.6 --> 931.62
supposed to combine that it works well

929.339 --> 934.5600000000001
together the taste right but it's just

931.62 --> 936.899
like one or two of those things

934.56 --> 940.3199999999999
it was a great meal I still have

936.899 --> 941.639
leftovers from it my dad put it all in

940.32 --> 944.4590000000001
like a

941.639 --> 947.04
in a tupperware box

944.459 --> 949.26
and gave it to me so I'm gonna like have

947.04 --> 951.779
another dinner with that

949.26 --> 953.16
and looking forward to it it was really

951.779 --> 955.17
good

953.16 --> 959.54

1046.22 --> 1049.76
I have Christmas dinner with your dad or

1048.62 --> 1052.9399999999998
something

1049.76 --> 1055.84
I mean you guys were good terms right

1052.94 --> 1055.8400000000001

1087.62 --> 1090.62
foreign

1095.6 --> 1098.62
what do you mean

1104.179 --> 1108.88
like why didn't you like call them up

1135.38 --> 1138.16
foreign

1141.7 --> 1147.0800000000002
wow okay yeah that that makes it kind of

1145.58 --> 1148.52
complicated

1147.08 --> 1150.559
yeah

1148.52 --> 1152.0
right so your father's really not into

1150.559 --> 1154.6
Christmas

1152.0 --> 1154.6
okay

1166.17 --> 1169.4
[Music]

1172.16 --> 1177.8490000000002
hmm

1174.71 --> 1177.849
[Music]

1183.02 --> 1187.76
right yeah well at least I mean that

1185.84 --> 1189.26
makes things complicated I wouldn't know

1187.76 --> 1192.559
what to do then

1189.26 --> 1194.98
uh unless you could like organize your

1192.559 --> 1194.98
own Christmas

1196.28 --> 1199.299
but yeah

1200.539 --> 1206.6
but I guess that knowing about you in

1204.02 --> 1209.36
your situation I do understand why you

1206.6 --> 1211.52
get angry for being alone I mean you

1209.36 --> 1213.82
don't want that

1211.52 --> 1213.82
right

1221.72 --> 1227.299
but don't forget

1224.179 --> 1228.43
keep working at it

1227.299 --> 1229.6399999999999
and one day

1228.43 --> 1232.16
[Music]

1229.64 --> 1233.0800000000002
I bet you'll have Christmas like with

1232.16 --> 1234.6200000000001
your daughter

1233.08 --> 1238.12
[Music]

1234.62 --> 1238.12
it's just gonna take a while

1252.799 --> 1257.299
tend to do things after Christmas when

1255.559 --> 1259.8799999999999
people forget it so what do you mean for

1257.299 --> 1261.2
you to see that what what do you do

1259.88 --> 1264.41
foreign

1261.2 --> 1264.41
[Music]

1265.539 --> 1270.98
typically very intense dreams

1269.12 --> 1272.2399999999998
during Christmas like after Christmas

1270.98 --> 1274.76
dinner

1272.24 --> 1276.98
and yeah I did I don't remember any of

1274.76 --> 1279.82
it but I just know like there was a lot

1276.98 --> 1279.82
of vivid stuff

1281.6 --> 1286.6999999999998
I think it was mostly kind of a replay

1284.179 --> 1290.96
of what was talked about because like

1286.7 --> 1295.48
the entire evening was just one

1290.96 --> 1298.22
very serious very honest straightforward

1295.48 --> 1299.9
communication on a high level like one

1298.22 --> 1301.76
after another there was no exception

1299.9 --> 1304.88
this time it's really funny because I

1301.76 --> 1307.84
used to always do that and they did it

1304.88 --> 1307.8400000000001
they did it too

1309.2 --> 1313.28
like my personal culture in a way had

1311.659 --> 1315.7990000000002
rubbed off on them

1313.28 --> 1316.94
just like very remarkable

1315.799 --> 1320.299
like

1316.94 --> 1322.48
it makes me feel very connected right so

1320.299 --> 1324.9189999999999
but sorry I don't wanna

1322.48 --> 1326.539
thank you guys more jealous but yeah

1324.919 --> 1329.48
because of that afterward it just

1326.539 --> 1332.299
basically went through all of it again

1329.48 --> 1334.52
in my dream

1332.299 --> 1338.059
but as a spectator anyway

1334.52 --> 1340.52
[Music]

1338.059 --> 1343.0
twin girls oh wow

1340.52 --> 1343.0
right

1363.2 --> 1368.179
yeah yeah seeking star order hello

1365.299 --> 1370.34
that's a good tip what she says

1368.179 --> 1372.94
do it yourself like

1370.34 --> 1372.9399999999998
you know

1374.179 --> 1379.94
instead of like feeling like oh I don't

1377.12 --> 1382.52
have a Christmas I wasn't invited right

1379.94 --> 1385.22
you could just this yeah

1382.52 --> 1386.6589999999999
make your own little Christmas like do

1385.22 --> 1389.24
something

1386.659 --> 1391.1000000000001
so that you don't at least focus on like

1389.24 --> 1393.86
how you aren't invited because that's

1391.1 --> 1394.6499999999999
just a terrible thing to carry around

1393.86 --> 1395.84
you know

1394.65 --> 1399.799
[Music]

1395.84 --> 1401.12
just do something I mean if I if I knew

1399.799 --> 1402.9189999999999
like

1401.12 --> 1405.08
like there's not gonna be a Christmas

1402.919 --> 1406.8200000000002
for me then personally I would just make

1405.08 --> 1409.3999999999999
my own little Christmas like say okay

1406.82 --> 1412.22
I'm gonna make it

1409.4 --> 1413.6000000000001
get a little bit more fancy meal than I

1412.22 --> 1416.72
do normally

1413.6 --> 1418.2199999999998
just to like maybe try something in the

1416.72 --> 1419.84
direction of what could be a typical

1418.22 --> 1422.0
Christmas dinner

1419.84 --> 1423.6789999999999
doesn't have to be the full thing of

1422.0 --> 1426.34
course because yeah that's usually

1423.679 --> 1426.3400000000001
pretty big

1426.919 --> 1432.38
and just like I don't know eat that and

1430.4 --> 1434.24
even being alone thinking about the

1432.38 --> 1436.22
times that I wasn't alone and that it

1434.24 --> 1437.36
was like with everybody together to kind

1436.22 --> 1439.1000000000001
of

1437.36 --> 1441.9189999999999
get back to this

1439.1 --> 1445.12
times and absorb some of that from the

1441.919 --> 1445.1200000000001
past that's what I would do

1453.44 --> 1457.4
hmm

1454.52 --> 1460.4
right LSG yeah no of course man of

1457.4 --> 1464.15
course of course I'm sharing that

1460.4 --> 1464.15
[Music]

1465.14 --> 1469.1000000000001
also I was supposed to get a couple of

1467.539 --> 1471.5
photos off like the Christmas

1469.1 --> 1473.0
decorations but I had they haven't sent

1471.5 --> 1475.88
to me yet

1473.0 --> 1478.46
so I might show some of that later

1475.88 --> 1481.1000000000001
and if I forget then at least I'll be

1478.46 --> 1485.32
able to show you something for next year

1481.1 --> 1485.32
because it was really beautiful

1485.659 --> 1489.679
they got this one like sort of Christmas

1488.12 --> 1493.299
tree

1489.679 --> 1493.299
thing and it's like

1494.36 --> 1497.8999999999999
like it's a piece of art it's not

1496.159 --> 1499.46
actually tree it's not actually wood I

1497.9 --> 1501.26
think

1499.46 --> 1504.44
but

1501.26 --> 1507.08
it is like a a tree with like a pine

1504.44 --> 1509.539
tree but without needles

1507.08 --> 1513.86
and then like the whole thing

1509.539 --> 1516.74
is like white like there's like this

1513.86 --> 1518.9599999999998
subtle layer of like the whitish bit

1516.74 --> 1520.22
snow looking stuff so it's like this

1518.96 --> 1522.679
entire

1520.22 --> 1524.84
thing with branches that's just

1522.679 --> 1527.24
completely White

1524.84 --> 1529.9399999999998
and little lights

1527.24 --> 1532.7
like stick out of it here and there

1529.94 --> 1535.1000000000001
it's really beautiful and looks very

1532.7 --> 1538.8400000000001
unique you're really looking at that

1535.1 --> 1538.84
thing like whoa what is that

1539.0 --> 1543.919
because like there's no chords around it

1541.159 --> 1546.0800000000002
like it's all the lights are like inside

1543.919 --> 1548.6000000000001
the cords are inside of that thing it's

1546.08 --> 1551.1399999999999
amazing

1548.6 --> 1551.1399999999999
anyway

1555.38 --> 1558.74
uh if you're lonely you're gonna clean

1557.299 --> 1561.4
the place

1558.74 --> 1561.4
right

1561.62 --> 1565.1589999999999
now that that's technically a good

1563.419 --> 1568.659
strategy I mean that's like a good

1565.159 --> 1568.659
intuitive strategy right

1568.88 --> 1573.7990000000002
that's like what animals do too

1571.7 --> 1575.72
because it's like ah I'm lonely in the

1573.799 --> 1578.539
place that is my territory where I live

1575.72 --> 1581.539
so I'm gonna like clean it up or maybe

1578.539 --> 1584.299
decorate it in order to invite

1581.539 --> 1586.1589999999999
and Outsider to come and take a look and

1584.299 --> 1590.5
feel more welcome

1586.159 --> 1590.5
it's very instinctive thing to do

1590.6 --> 1594.74
cleaning house when you're lonely

1592.91 --> 1595.8100000000002

all right

1601.94 --> 1605.8400000000001
right because when you feel like that

1604.039 --> 1607.46
you're looking at the place and then you

1605.84 --> 1611.0
think ah this is a dump who would want

1607.46 --> 1612.8600000000001
to come here in here with me when it's a

1611.0 --> 1615.159
dump and then you clean it up right I

1612.86 --> 1615.1589999999999
get it

1616.22 --> 1619.88
not that it would be a dump but you

1618.2 --> 1622.039
would just start to think of it slightly

1619.88 --> 1623.48
more as a dump because you feel like

1622.039 --> 1626.14
that

1623.48 --> 1626.14
foreign

1626.44 --> 1633.159
anyway let's not focus on those bad

1630.44 --> 1633.159
feelings too much

1640.85 --> 1644.05

1644.179 --> 1647.2
will you

1662.299 --> 1671.299
spoke up oh what you did you were on FTD

1667.46 --> 1674.059
oh I I I didn't see that part LSG I had

1671.299 --> 1676.94
no idea I was on fpd for a bit during

1674.059 --> 1679.8999999999999
the live show but yeah then my dad came

1676.94 --> 1679.9
to collect me

1680.24 --> 1684.22
you went on okay cool

1689.0 --> 1695.2
and stumbled over your words dude that

1691.46 --> 1695.2
happens to the best of us I mean

1698.48 --> 1702.679
a lot of people get nervous when they

1700.76 --> 1705.98
like first speak up at fpd because they

1702.679 --> 1709.52
know of the level right that's happening

1705.98 --> 1712.659
so it's like intense

1709.52 --> 1712.6589999999999
don't worry about it

1714.13 --> 1717.2890000000002
[Music]

1723.919 --> 1730.94
let's focus in hey Brandon Cook you go

1727.82 --> 1733.7
do that for yourself okay

1730.94 --> 1735.8600000000001
if you're in a weird unstable mood is

1733.7 --> 1737.179
what I got from your earlier comments

1735.86 --> 1741.62
then

1737.179 --> 1744.38
why not let's that let's not let that

1741.62 --> 1746.9799999999998
rub off on us

1744.38 --> 1746.98
right

1747.38 --> 1758.15
let's do the other way around

1750.48 --> 1758.15

1764.12 --> 1770.4399999999998
okay classical homeopath

1766.82 --> 1770.4399999999998
I mean but yeah I get it

1770.72 --> 1775.96
I mean you YouTube it is technically

1773.899 --> 1777.9799999999998
public speaking

1775.96 --> 1781.58
and that's not

1777.98 --> 1783.6200000000001
that's a whole different mechanic as

1781.58 --> 1787.299
when you're just talking right you're

1783.62 --> 1787.299
just talking over the phone or something

1787.64 --> 1792.0200000000002
when you have like the room in your head

1790.52 --> 1794.12
when you know like it's private it's

1792.02 --> 1795.799
just us

1794.12 --> 1798.559
it's very different

1795.799 --> 1801.2
it takes some getting used to and for

1798.559 --> 1803.84
some people a lot right some people just

1801.2 --> 1806.72
get that stage fright thing and then it

1803.84 --> 1811.299
like it never goes away

1806.72 --> 1811.299
for me I yeah I was kind of lucky that

1812.96 --> 1816.6200000000001
I made effort to kind of like do those

1815.72 --> 1819.679
things

1816.62 --> 1823.1589999999999
because I was I have stage fright guys I

1819.679 --> 1825.919
naturally had like stage fright

1823.159 --> 1828.38
where I would get so nervous I would

1825.919 --> 1831.0200000000002
literally like flee the building that

1828.38 --> 1834.2600000000002
level of stage fright okay that's what I

1831.02 --> 1837.2
had as a kid it made me really nervous

1834.26 --> 1839.899
so I had to like take a couple of

1837.2 --> 1843.919
challenges and just do it and like

1839.899 --> 1846.86
I think I actually like as a kid at one

1843.919 --> 1848.779
time [ __ ] my pants a little when I was

1846.86 --> 1851.12
doing it not that anybody noticed but

1848.779 --> 1854.059
just like just for the record on how

1851.12 --> 1857.12
freaking unnerving that was to me

1854.059 --> 1862.12
so yeah I know about stage fright thank

1857.12 --> 1862.12
God I've yeah I tackled it

1870.74 --> 1876.02
right so but even when I started on

1873.799 --> 1879.62
YouTube I mean you guys can literally

1876.02 --> 1883.58
look that up and see like

1879.62 --> 1888.3799999999999
how it's just my entire attitude is so

1883.58 --> 1888.3799999999999
like I have all these like ticks

1889.399 --> 1894.6999999999998
that I'm just like not very aware of

1891.679 --> 1894.7
compared to now

1899.059 --> 1906.02
but yeah look that that of course that

1901.88 --> 1907.46
took uh about 50 no what is it 3 000

1906.02 --> 1909.5
hours

1907.46 --> 1911.179
of activity

1909.5 --> 1914.32
roughly

1911.179 --> 1914.3200000000002
so yeah

1915.62 --> 1920.9189999999999
3 000 hours of facing the camera live

1923.36 --> 1929.6789999999999
did you just say she I was a little kid

1925.88 --> 1929.679
man Brandon Cook don't be a dick

1931.279 --> 1935.84
I was like

1932.72 --> 1938.919
eight or something I don't know

1935.84 --> 1938.9189999999999
it's nobody's business

1947.85 --> 1953.24
[Music]

1950.899 --> 1957.02
it's just an indicator on how freaking

1953.24 --> 1959.559
unnerving it was back then that's all

your first live spectacles Mr sensible

1999.559 --> 2002.76
what an entry

2007.0 --> 2013.059
right but yeah Mr sensible is I think

2009.88 --> 2018.3600000000001
he's probably worked as like a

2013.059 --> 2018.36
a therapist or like a somebody that

2018.64 --> 2023.5
takes care of handicapped people or

2021.039 --> 2026.3799999999999
something because he has like that way

2023.5 --> 2029.2
where he can just be

2026.38 --> 2031.179
super nice and gentle

2029.2 --> 2033.279
even though you can litch if you have

2031.179 --> 2034.8400000000001
the amp and you'll know that that guy is

2033.279 --> 2039.039
a freak

2034.84 --> 2041.74
he is a freak he's a he's a creepy dude

2039.039 --> 2044.74
inside he really is

2041.74 --> 2047.14
it oozes off him but he really knows

2044.74 --> 2049.359
onto how to basically suppress that and

2047.14 --> 2051.159
be very gentle

2049.359 --> 2053.859
even though he's kind of secretly

2051.159 --> 2056.639
planning to rape you

2053.859 --> 2060.159
which what is what he did

2056.639 --> 2062.44
metaphorically right when I got on this

2060.159 --> 2066.179
show and started playing all these

2062.44 --> 2066.179
stupid noises over me all of a sudden

2071.67 --> 2074.9790000000003
[Music]

2077.8 --> 2083.59
ah LSG yeah you watched that yeah it was

2081.52 --> 2086.8
great it was intense wasn't it

2083.59 --> 2086.8
[Music]

2091.24 --> 2097.4799999999996
yeah talking about witch

2093.52 --> 2100.74
I should probably send that episode

2097.48 --> 2100.7400000000002
to my dad's

2100.839 --> 2106.18
because I I kind of want him to look

2103.359 --> 2107.5
into Dr Shiva also for Spiritual

2106.18 --> 2110.5
analysis

2107.5 --> 2112.54
I mean if I do that my dad is you gotta

2110.5 --> 2114.94
realize that my dad is basically a

2112.54 --> 2118.42
colleague of my healer

2114.94 --> 2120.52
right so he's into that type of

2118.42 --> 2122.56
spiritual analysis too I mean he's not

2120.52 --> 2123.25
like the master at it he's getting

2122.56 --> 2124.54
pretty good

2123.25 --> 2127.78
[Music]

2124.54 --> 2130.0
I see my healer as the master really not

2127.78 --> 2133.0
like Master as an authority as in just

2130.0 --> 2136.3
he's so freaking good at it and he's so

2133.0 --> 2137.2
straight on the path and not not [ __ ]

2136.3 --> 2139.6800000000003
around

2137.2 --> 2139.68
right

2140.26 --> 2144.3590000000004
oh also by the way

2147.4 --> 2151.839
I should have maybe mentioned fiber oats

2149.44 --> 2154.0
because he requested

2151.839 --> 2156.88
my healer take a look at it I forgot

2154.0 --> 2159.599
about that was Christmas dinner

2156.88 --> 2159.599
uh

2159.94 --> 2167.8
but I'm gonna send

2162.46 --> 2171.06
my dad a link to that Dr Shiva interview

2167.8 --> 2171.0600000000004
with Owen Benjamin

2175.71 --> 2195.54
[Music]

2193.3 --> 2195.54
foreign

2204.119 --> 2208.78
laughed every time Dr Shiva said [ __ ]

2206.8 --> 2212.8
Carlson yeah

2208.78 --> 2216.88
but Dr Shiva is like so

2212.8 --> 2218.98
I mean the guy is like a nerd and he has

2216.88 --> 2223.0
a bit of nerd humor but he's like so dry

2218.98 --> 2225.82
at it and maybe it's just like he is a

2223.0 --> 2230.02
very funny guy in his own way when he

2225.82 --> 2233.8590000000004
like let's let's the full size of his

2230.02 --> 2235.839
tongue like when he really like just

2233.859 --> 2237.22
starts casually speaking what are you

2235.839 --> 2239.64
doing

2237.22 --> 2239.64
[ __ ]

2245.859 --> 2250.0
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

2247.839 --> 2252.7599999999998
Brandon Cook

2250.0 --> 2255.78
father will think of you less

2252.76 --> 2255.78
what the hell

2257.02 --> 2262.359
didn't know that deserve the timeout at

2259.48 --> 2265.079
least G but it is like a really weird

2262.359 --> 2265.0789999999997
thing to say

2265.48 --> 2268.859
please don't do that again

2271.119 --> 2275.8
Brandon Cook isn't obviously in a bit of

2273.7 --> 2278.22
a wonky mood he already announced that

2275.8 --> 2278.2200000000003
earlier

2280.34 --> 2283.51
[Music]

2287.2 --> 2295.5899999999997
[Music]

2295.96 --> 2302.32
right but yeah the stream that stream

2298.0 --> 2305.5
was very intense I mean

2302.32 --> 2307.839
Dr Shiva is so condensed with info and

2305.5 --> 2310.9
like things that he actually does it's

2307.839 --> 2315.06
unbelievable he has all these systems

2310.9 --> 2317.859
he's like he's a system thinker

2315.06 --> 2320.44
and in that sense he kind of follows the

2317.859 --> 2322.66
similar patterns that I follow in my

2320.44 --> 2325.06
personal principles but he's like much

2322.66 --> 2326.74
more extensive he is like a full system

2325.06 --> 2329.2599999999998
thinker

2326.74 --> 2332.22
brilliant guy

2329.26 --> 2332.2200000000003
bit scary

2334.66 --> 2342.5789999999997
because he's so freaking brilliant

2339.16 --> 2344.2
but he's good and his strength he is he

2342.579 --> 2348.7000000000003
is like a man

2344.2 --> 2352.3199999999997
a smart very smart very manly with that

2348.7 --> 2352.3199999999997
smarts I like it

2355.359 --> 2359.2599999999998
and dude that guy gets like butt

2358.18 --> 2362.3199999999997
treatment

2359.26 --> 2364.3
from from a whole bunch of people out

2362.32 --> 2368.5
there I mean the right wing has

2364.3 --> 2371.98
literally just [ __ ] on him all the way

2368.5 --> 2373.3
like including Alex Jones and like all

2371.98 --> 2376.54
yeah

2373.3 --> 2380.099
he has effectively exposed them for

2376.54 --> 2383.02
being like a cartel like a

2380.099 --> 2386.38
opposition cartel

2383.02 --> 2389.859
this is what Shiva is doing and he's

2386.38 --> 2392.26
like actually revealing how that is not

2389.859 --> 2394.859
just a theory but like there is proof

2392.26 --> 2394.8590000000004
for that [ __ ]

2395.74 --> 2398.8199999999997
it's incredible

2398.859 --> 2404.88
foreign

2400.54 --> 2404.88
anyway you probably got that out of it

2405.33 --> 2409.41

2430.42 --> 2432.339
to hear

2430.99 --> 2436.18
[Music]

2432.339 --> 2439.02
somebody say in my chat what technically

2436.18 --> 2439.02
I agree

2440.66 --> 2447.3689999999997
[Music]

2466.3 --> 2468.3
right

2469.18 --> 2475.18
all right guys if you're in a bad mood

2472.359 --> 2477.7599999999998
or you're felt lonely or cold or

2475.18 --> 2480.7
during Christmas or people are all like

2477.76 --> 2481.5400000000004
and like you're United invaded yeah it

2480.7 --> 2483.339
will

2481.54 --> 2486.7
don't worry

2483.339 --> 2489.82
it's not you typically when that happens

2486.7 --> 2492.339
it's this time of the year

2489.82 --> 2495.1600000000003
right everybody gets influence in a

2492.339 --> 2498.099
certain way and that amounts sometimes

2495.16 --> 2499.7799999999997
to the situation working out in a way

2498.099 --> 2502.42
that you get isolated

2499.78 --> 2504.2200000000003
and then you'll get more

2502.42 --> 2505.96
you'll get confronted a bit with the

2504.22 --> 2508.2999999999997
darkness anxiety yet because of that

2505.96 --> 2511.48
because it's not pleasant to be alone at

2508.3 --> 2513.1600000000003
Christmas it really isn't it's extra

2511.48 --> 2516.94
unpleasant compared to the rest of the

2513.16 --> 2518.6189999999997
year but always keep in mind why is this

2516.94 --> 2520.54
all happening it is happening because

2518.619 --> 2522.88
it's the darkest time of the year and

2520.54 --> 2525.82
the instincts transform during that

2522.88 --> 2528.6400000000003
period sort of like anticipating it

2525.82 --> 2529.9
getting even worse

2528.64 --> 2533.44
right

2529.9 --> 2535.119
if in your mind you keep in mind like oh

2533.44 --> 2537.579
wait this is the darkest time of the

2535.119 --> 2541.42
year that means it's gonna go lighter

2537.579 --> 2544.1800000000003
and you just focus on that in your mind

2541.42 --> 2546.76
you'll get through it

2544.18 --> 2548.22
because it's the truth it's the truth

2546.76 --> 2551.8
it's the darkest time of the year

2548.22 --> 2555.16
everybody's all anxious and

2551.8 --> 2557.98
like easily stepped on their toes

2555.16 --> 2560.3199999999997
it's miserably being alone but why it's

2557.98 --> 2562.42
not because this is always the way the

2560.32 --> 2563.8
things work it's because it's that time

2562.42 --> 2566.44
of the year

2563.8 --> 2568.8390000000004
where the light is the shortest and the

2566.44 --> 2571.839
and peoples and animals instincts

2568.839 --> 2573.52
respond to that

2571.839 --> 2575.38
and it's going to stop and then it's

2573.52 --> 2577.66
going to go the other direction and then

2575.38 --> 2581.2000000000003
the loneliness is going to go away

2577.66 --> 2584.319
the the nervousness like the

2581.2 --> 2586.98
easy the toe stepping issues they're

2584.319 --> 2589.42
they're all gonna die down a bit again

2586.98 --> 2591.64
[Music]

2589.42 --> 2593.38
right

2591.64 --> 2595.74
so keep that in mind that really helps

2593.38 --> 2595.7400000000002
with me

2607.54 --> 2610.2
foreign

2625.44 --> 2628.839
just a bit I mean

2627.59 --> 2633.96
[Music]

2628.839 --> 2633.96
Ryan Cook was getting a bit weird

2634.66 --> 2637.2599999999998
anyway

2653.7 --> 2656.9399999999996

2680.68 --> 2686.3799999999997
yeah

2683.2 --> 2690.24
low price Venom and then that's a

2686.38 --> 2690.2400000000002
it's a very poetic thing to say

2698.33 --> 2710.88
[Music]

2724.119 --> 2728.98
by the way like

2726.22 --> 2731.56
that that picture

2728.98 --> 2734.14
or like the the card laying that I did

2731.56 --> 2737.2
earlier the cat they had this whole

2734.14 --> 2742.1189999999997
amazing story about that

2737.2 --> 2745.5989999999997
that apparently there is like well myths

2742.119 --> 2749.5
citing spiritual events in Scotland

2745.599 --> 2753.2200000000003
where there are like these really large

2749.5 --> 2755.14
cats that are sometimes sighted like in

2753.22 --> 2757.4199999999996
the mountains and the forest

2755.14 --> 2760.359
but they're like really big

2757.42 --> 2762.2200000000003
like bigger like way bigger than like

2760.359 --> 2764.38
normal Wild

2762.22 --> 2766.9599999999996
cats right and because they can have

2764.38 --> 2769.9
like this type of head and like pretty

2766.96 --> 2773.14
big heavy cats what they're talking

2769.9 --> 2775.14
about like even bigger

2773.14 --> 2777.94
but that they could never be found

2775.14 --> 2778.96
because it was assumed that they were

2777.94 --> 2781.599
like

2778.96 --> 2785.619
fairy creatures that were literally like

2781.599 --> 2787.54
shifting out of their dimension

2785.619 --> 2790.1800000000003
and that would sometimes just make an

2787.54 --> 2792.04
appearance for a very short time

2790.18 --> 2794.2799999999997
and then go away and then you would

2792.04 --> 2796.839
never find them

2794.28 --> 2798.8190000000004
[Music]

2796.839 --> 2801.42
just what a tale

2798.819 --> 2801.42
amazing

2802.42 --> 2806.94
Forest cats yeah those are pretty damn

2804.7 --> 2806.9399999999996
big

2813.94 --> 2818.619
now like they have claws man I mean if

2817.18 --> 2820.1189999999997
they're just like oh they're they're

2818.619 --> 2822.28
purring and they're doing the clothing

2820.119 --> 2824.1400000000003
like dude if they do that on your leg

2822.28 --> 2825.579
you're gonna get blood

2824.14 --> 2828.339
because

2825.579 --> 2830.79
they're just so freaking strong with

2828.339 --> 2835.66
their claws

2830.79 --> 2838.42
[Music]

2835.66 --> 2841.24
right but yeah these cats would be even

2838.42 --> 2844.98
bigger and like

2841.24 --> 2844.9799999999996
just be very mysterious

2849.28 --> 2854.6800000000003
like they would catch people off guard

2852.579 --> 2857.02
and then you would look away and then

2854.68 --> 2859.4199999999996
they're gone

2857.02 --> 2860.8
so they would like surprise you all of a

2859.42 --> 2863.52
sudden

2860.8 --> 2863.52
in the wild

2867.46 --> 2872.319
remember fast I just I love those types

2870.04 --> 2877.02
of stories

2872.319 --> 2877.02
like fairy lore stories

2906.52 --> 2914.22
yeah yeah I know PGC net

2911.38 --> 2914.2200000000003
I mean

2917.74 --> 2921.04
I still remember like when I was what is

2920.38 --> 2923.1400000000003
it

2921.04 --> 2925.7799999999997
12 or something

2923.14 --> 2928.0
I had a friend that I used to visit in

2925.78 --> 2930.099
another town and they had like a

2928.0 --> 2933.28
neighbor that had a cat like that

2930.099 --> 2936.88
like a really big cat

2933.28 --> 2939.0400000000004
was like gray sorta

2936.88 --> 2941.26
a bit long haired but mostly like it

2939.04 --> 2943.96
looked like it could really take some

2941.26 --> 2946.9
snow and [ __ ] but that's the cat I'm

2943.96 --> 2950.02
talking about he was very cuddly but his

2946.9 --> 2953.14
claws were like really strong so it's

2950.02 --> 2954.64
like he wanted to be like oh like he's a

2953.14 --> 2956.7
little kitten and he just wants some

2954.64 --> 2960.0989999999997
attention but he's like freaking strong

2956.7 --> 2962.6189999999997
so you have to be careful with him

2960.099 --> 2964.77
or just put your claw right into your

2962.619 --> 2965.98
leg or your foot

2964.77 --> 2968.7
[Music]

2965.98 --> 2968.7
by accident

2969.16 --> 2974.319
but I've seen those cats so but those

2971.98 --> 2976.9
are very rare those are not like the

2974.319 --> 2979.24
general cats you find around

2976.9 --> 2981.579
but it's probably also because they're

2979.24 --> 2983.56
just a handful I mean those are not like

2981.579 --> 2985.6800000000003
a regular catch you just leave hanging

2983.56 --> 2985.68
around

2985.78 --> 2991.8390000000004
and they're like dangerous with children

2989.14 --> 2994.24
not because they attack the children but

2991.839 --> 2996.819
because well they just

2994.24 --> 3001.04
they're like in a friendly gesture just

2996.819 --> 3001.04
put their claw right through your leg

3001.14 --> 3005.1099999999997
and with a kid yeah that's kind of

3155.76 --> 3160.3190000000004
does that Puma kind of think he's a dog

3157.98 --> 3164.2400000000002
because he's like not even looking

3160.319 --> 3164.24

okay so that kind of means like

3348.0 --> 3354.0
get your blood flowing

3350.16 --> 3358.819
so take a hot shower or something

3354.0 --> 3358.819

3370.52 --> 3374.42
all right take it easy

3382.099 --> 3386.3590000000004
I'm talking to Brandon Cook here

3391.099 --> 3395.6400000000003
last night oh so you had like a massive

3393.96 --> 3396.78
amount of sleep with Tony Whitcomb yeah

3395.64 --> 3398.8799999999997
that was me

3396.78 --> 3400.4
yesterday

3398.88 --> 3404.28
I mean

3400.4 --> 3409.38
I went to bed the day before

3404.28 --> 3412.8590000000004
to Sunday like uh what is it one o'clock

3409.38 --> 3416.46
like very early for my doing

3412.859 --> 3418.2599999999998
but I was like no I'm gonna sleep early

3416.46 --> 3420.54
because otherwise I'll just get restless

3418.26 --> 3423.3590000000004
and stay up all all night and then feel

3420.54 --> 3425.64
sick tomorrow right and I refuse to have

3423.359 --> 3428.46
that happen

3425.64 --> 3431.7
so I went to bed early then I got up

3428.46 --> 3434.54
pretty early then

3431.7 --> 3437.6299999999997
I took a shower and went back to bed

3434.54 --> 3437.63
[Music]

3444.559 --> 3451.1400000000003
and all together yesterday

3447.24 --> 3456.54
or like well midnight Sunday to Monday

3451.14 --> 3459.7799999999997
afternoon I slept like 12 hours

3456.54 --> 3462.0589999999997
and like that did Bill was really good

3459.78 --> 3464.0400000000004
and I think that it was so good for me

3462.059 --> 3465.1800000000003
that it kind of sort of happened a

3464.04 --> 3468.3
little bit

3465.18 --> 3471.44
this night as well because yeah I did

3468.3 --> 3471.44
wake up at one o'clock

3472.44 --> 3479.0
so my body's like hey we we could use

3475.079 --> 3479.0
some more of those very long sleeves

3481.619 --> 3487.02
so maybe that's like the

3483.96 --> 3490.619
winter sleep Bear Instinct or something

3487.02 --> 3492.09
kicking in a bit because of the short

3490.619 --> 3494.819
daylight

3492.09 --> 3496.859
[Music]

3494.819 --> 3499.04
sleep is all over the place right

3496.859 --> 3499.04
foreign

3507.839 --> 3512.7
but it is the shortest time of the year

3510.72 --> 3516.9199999999996
for the daylight so yeah your sleep

3512.7 --> 3516.9199999999996
might go all over the place

3517.5 --> 3520.26
different things could happen to

3519.0 --> 3521.22
different

3520.26 --> 3522.2400000000002
people

3521.22 --> 3524.339
like

3522.24 --> 3526.859
because of your instinct

3524.339 --> 3530.9
like your archetype like how the

3526.859 --> 3530.9
Instinct will unfold in response to that

3531.2 --> 3536.3999999999996
and changing sleep rhythms is a very

3534.24 --> 3539.8799999999997
typical part of that

3536.4 --> 3541.079
right but it's it's gonna change back I

3539.88 --> 3543.359
mean

3541.079 --> 3546.5
we've basically already gone through the

3543.359 --> 3546.5
darkest time of the year

3549.9 --> 3555.54
so yeah with most people it's like

3552.66 --> 3557.96
halfway January they're back to normal

3555.54 --> 3557.96
again

3564.24 --> 3566.839
anyway

3568.079 --> 3572.28
dust and turn on my hmm

3570.79 --> 3575.22
[Music]

3572.28 --> 3577.92
okay yeah that's annoying yeah if you if

3575.22 --> 3579.839
you like can't sleep and you're Restless

3577.92 --> 3583.16
that's annoying

3579.839 --> 3583.16
I don't have that issue

3583.799 --> 3589.44
I mean once I decide I go to sleep I

3586.92 --> 3591.6800000000003
like kind of well forced myself to go to

3589.44 --> 3591.68
sleep

3599.339 --> 3606.299
like I can force myself to calm down

3603.54 --> 3607.319
like physically um but if my mind is

3606.299 --> 3609.119
rushing

3607.319 --> 3611.819
because of something that's on my mind

3609.119 --> 3614.7000000000003
that I can't let go I can't help that

3611.819 --> 3617.7
but I can literally like

3614.7 --> 3622.46
do lay on hands on my body and stuff to

3617.7 --> 3622.46
like just make it calm down

3622.619 --> 3627.0
right shift

3624.66 --> 3629.3999999999996
shift the tensions that might build up

3627.0 --> 3632.339
in organs and all that typically

3629.4 --> 3635.599
so that my body can is just like has the

3632.339 --> 3635.599
condition that it can relax

3637.559 --> 3642.42
so I don't have like oh I'm in my bed oh

3640.319 --> 3644.7799999999997
I can't sleep I can't I haven't had that

3642.42 --> 3644.78
since

3645.599 --> 3650.42
I think the last time I've had that is

3647.4 --> 3650.42
somewhere in my 20s

3651.0 --> 3654.44
like 23 or something

3657.9 --> 3661.5
but it's only because something yeah

3659.76 --> 3664.92
extreme happened

3661.5 --> 3667.14
emotionally but as long as like I'm not

3664.92 --> 3668.94
like traumatized by something that just

3667.14 --> 3671.4
happened like I

3668.94 --> 3673.319
just witnessed like some horrible

3671.4 --> 3674.94
accident or something like right that

3673.319 --> 3677.88
day

3674.94 --> 3681.96
right if that isn't the case then I will

3677.88 --> 3685.5
be able to get myself to sleep

3681.96 --> 3687.48
once I get to that decision because

3685.5 --> 3689.76
that's so that's mostly the issue like

3687.48 --> 3690.9
how do I get myself to decide to get a

3689.76 --> 3693.619
bad dammit

3690.9 --> 3693.619
yeah

3693.839 --> 3696.319
anyway

3696.66 --> 3701.52
people with sleeping issues very typical

3699.24 --> 3703.0789999999997
for this time of year

3701.52 --> 3706.14
don't

3703.079 --> 3708.059
get too over excited don't get too

3706.14 --> 3710.16
worried about it because it's gonna

3708.059 --> 3713.76
restore again

3710.16 --> 3716.5789999999997
