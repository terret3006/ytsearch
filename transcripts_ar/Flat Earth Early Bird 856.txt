the weather today

91.0 --> 97.34
[Music]

93.479 --> 97.34
is kind of cloudy again

97.86 --> 105.74
there's wind too but something stood out

101.04 --> 105.74000000000001
like it's not the wind's not cold today

105.78 --> 112.979
I haven't seen any snowfall either

109.5 --> 115.259
today even though it it pretty much kept

112.979 --> 117.479
on all night

115.259 --> 120.18
even when I went to bed

117.479 --> 121.799
looked outside there was literally a

120.18 --> 124.07900000000001
layer of snow

121.799 --> 127.88000000000001
on the roof and in the grass but it's

124.079 --> 127.88
yeah it's melted since then

128.399 --> 133.52
but there was actually a layer of snow

130.5 --> 133.52
in the night

137.76 --> 140.12
right

141.3 --> 146.4
but for now yeah it's just really wet

143.76 --> 149.34
outside and all that

146.4 --> 153.5
hope it's gonna stay dry

149.34 --> 153.5
when I do my newspaper rounds later

154.019 --> 156.62
huh

162.599 --> 165.44
so

166.319 --> 173.819
it's Wednesday

168.48 --> 173.819
the 7th of April 2021

182.84 --> 186.26
let's see

187.379 --> 190.04
all right

196.019 --> 200.58
so yeah yesterday's show

198.54 --> 204.84
I watched it back

200.58 --> 206.94000000000003
was kind of shocked because it was kind

204.84 --> 208.56
of different from what I thought it was

206.94 --> 210.299
going to be

208.56 --> 212.94
even though I had some really good

210.299 --> 214.26000000000002
information in there

212.94 --> 217.98
I was

214.26 --> 220.07999999999998
really not in a good mood I noticed and

217.98 --> 222.959
weird thing is I kind of knew that

220.08 --> 226.08
during the show

222.959 --> 229.81900000000002
but afterward watching it back like it

226.08 --> 229.81900000000002
was kind of worse than I thought it was

230.64 --> 236.819
and not really super happy about that

233.819 --> 239.7
now a couple of people yeah in here also

236.819 --> 241.14
had a bad mood I guess we're kind of

239.7 --> 244.2
rowdy

241.14 --> 247.5
here we go again

244.2 --> 249.48
and I don't know that rubbed off me in

247.5 --> 253.5
the wrong way I think

249.48 --> 257.12
I tried even yeah I tried it to prevent

253.5 --> 260.16
that during it but it didn't really work

257.12 --> 261.66
didn't get really out of control or

260.16 --> 264.78000000000003
anything

261.66 --> 266.52000000000004
but I was yeah just didn't feel as well

264.78 --> 269.17999999999995
as it should have

266.52 --> 269.18
to me

271.08 --> 279.68
hello Michael oh no Fray

274.919 --> 279.68
flat earthers yeah flat earthers

280.139 --> 283.34000000000003
that Earth is indeed

285.419 --> 289.09999999999997
so I got green tea with me

294.9 --> 299.0
Ah that's it

301.259 --> 307.82
like the road sweeping cart out there

304.8 --> 307.82
making a lot of noise

310.8 --> 316.94
don't know if the mic picks it up but

313.919 --> 316.94
I'm picking it up

320.699 --> 326.58000000000004
for whatever reason it decided to start

322.74 --> 329.699
sweeping here right when my show started

326.58 --> 332.71999999999997
I hope he kind of like gets done soon

329.699 --> 332.72
gets out of here

334.88 --> 339.74
hey Ragnar Stefan helderson

340.62 --> 345.6
been off for a while glad to see that

343.02 --> 347.52
you're still at it ah

345.6 --> 349.259
yeah welcome back

347.52 --> 352.44
it has been a while

349.259 --> 354.539
but it's good to take a break

352.44 --> 357.68
if you need it

354.539 --> 357.68
good to have you back

368.819 --> 372.259
Okay so

372.539 --> 379.09999999999997
take it this is a troll

375.96 --> 379.09999999999997
trying to be funny

382.74 --> 388.139
Because unless you're going to have an

385.199 --> 390.41900000000004
actual point to bring in my chat or just

388.139 --> 393.419
have normal conversation

390.419 --> 398.84
if you're just gonna try to make some

393.419 --> 398.84
stupid superficial jokes in my chat

399.3 --> 404.36
without actually even directing at

402.06 --> 404.36
anything

404.46 --> 408.9
I will just kick you

406.919 --> 411.979
right I'm just gonna treat you like a

408.9 --> 411.979
troll so

415.5 --> 422.419
a ajm good to see you and Neil Cosentino

419.18 --> 422.419
little brother

426.8 --> 434.18
so did anybody else watch my show

430.08 --> 434.18
yesterday I think AGM was there

439.979 --> 446.18
oh wow

442.56 --> 446.18
wait to reveal yourself there

463.199 --> 469.199
right I like I liked how I titled it in

467.099 --> 471.599
overall in the hangout it was a pretty

469.199 --> 473.52000000000004
short part when I brought that up the

471.599 --> 476.699
subject

473.52 --> 479.52
like the forms of communication I would

476.699 --> 482.28000000000003
originally unfold it first telepathy

479.52 --> 485.539
then iconography then spoken language

482.28 --> 485.539
and then the written language

498.3 --> 504.599
right like these are little Snippets of

501.599 --> 508.5
my ideas you know a lot of people

504.599 --> 511.139
they have like long stories

508.5 --> 513.44
like a small little painting and it's

511.139 --> 517.039
like presented to be a memorable story

513.44 --> 517.0390000000001
and it's usually

517.399 --> 522.659
relatively sizable

519.899 --> 525.86
with me it's different

522.659 --> 525.86
I I

529.26 --> 534.06
just

531.42 --> 536.5799999999999
think about these things and then I tend

534.06 --> 539.0999999999999
to summarize it just in

536.58 --> 542.76
one sentence

539.1 --> 545.76
something really concise and simple

542.76 --> 549.18
and then hey if somebody like wants me

545.76 --> 551.64
to elaborate on it then I can if they

549.18 --> 553.92
actually show that their understanding

551.64 --> 556.8
and that they're interested

553.92 --> 559.5799999999999
could just trying to push my button to

556.8 --> 562.5
say more when you don't understand it

559.58 --> 565.94
that's not that's not working that

562.5 --> 565.94
doesn't work that way

567.839 --> 574.6400000000001
I hope you guys have noticed this

572.04 --> 574.64
right

587.22 --> 593.279
but yeah I think that

589.92 --> 595.8
maybe I have been thinking maybe I

593.279 --> 599.0
should just try to write a book

595.8 --> 599.0
in a different way

599.279 --> 606.12
and I I do that by basically putting

603.24 --> 608.88
everything together

606.12 --> 611.88
like all the ideas I've had that are

608.88 --> 611.88
ingrained

612.48 --> 618.86
especially the the overarching ones of

616.079 --> 618.8599999999999
arcing ones

620.16 --> 626.64
and if I just make a lot of notes

623.82 --> 629.279
about these Concepts put it in a list

626.64 --> 632.399
and then try to kind of like

629.279 --> 634.68
well form a story out of it basically

632.399 --> 638.82
putting all the puzzle pieces in the

634.68 --> 642.0
right place and then try to work it into

638.82 --> 643.6800000000001
it yeah like an age development

642.0 --> 647.779
description

643.68 --> 647.779
type of story like a historical

648.24 --> 651.9590000000001
that has an historical development feel

650.459 --> 653.5189999999999
to it

651.959 --> 657.5999999999999
and then I could

653.519 --> 661.38
yeah get a book basically giving a like

657.6 --> 663.72
a Fantastical people would call it

661.38 --> 667.4399999999999
alternative history

663.72 --> 669.839
conception gives a different feel for

667.44 --> 671.6400000000001
what people are used to right now based

669.839 --> 674.6400000000001
on

671.64 --> 677.04
on our yeah on the materials that have

674.64 --> 678.899
been handed to us and seem to have all

677.04 --> 682.56
been designed

678.899 --> 685.019
to bind our psychologies into specific

682.56 --> 687.18
railroad formats

685.019 --> 690.3
like especially things like physicality

687.18 --> 691.8
assumption bias right playing into these

690.3 --> 693.779
mechanisms

691.8 --> 695.76
like the psychology psychological

693.779 --> 698.399
mechanisms

695.76 --> 699.6
of humanity have likely been all figured

698.399 --> 703.079
out

699.6 --> 704.76
far beyond what we typically in this age

703.079 --> 707.16
now understand

704.76 --> 708.18
and the mechanisms of development and

707.16 --> 711.899
teaching

708.18 --> 714.779
and storytelling that are being used to

711.899 --> 718.04
educate us over the generations

714.779 --> 718.04
were designed

718.86 --> 727.44
to bring us towards all these

723.92 --> 731.519
mechanisms in ourselves

727.44 --> 734.2790000000001
that would yeah make us stay

731.519 --> 736.92
in that mindset associated with these

734.279 --> 739.86
teachings and they tried to push it very

736.92 --> 742.019
far through atheism and yeah then at

739.86 --> 745.88
some point it doesn't work anymore

742.019 --> 745.88
unless you're really vacated

745.92 --> 751.019
you don't use your sensories anymore

748.62 --> 754.139
but even if you do all that and you try

751.019 --> 756.779
to resist then even at the ends of all

754.139 --> 759.1800000000001
that knowledge you're still typically

756.779 --> 762.24
going to be confronted with all these

759.18 --> 766.1389999999999
mechanisms within us that

762.24 --> 768.42
of our psychology that bind us

766.139 --> 770.519
to certain ways of thinking and this is

768.42 --> 773.0
one of the main things that I've been

770.519 --> 773.0
trying to

773.519 --> 778.74
release

775.32 --> 781.62
Humanity from myself for starters to

778.74 --> 784.5790000000001
release myself from those spells from

781.62 --> 784.579
those aberrations

785.459 --> 790.3199999999999
I've been trying to do that very

787.5 --> 792.899
consistently getting a lot of friction

790.32 --> 796.0790000000001
from all sides all sides not just even

792.899 --> 799.44
YouTube or anything

796.079 --> 802.079
like everywhere even from within

799.44 --> 805.139
like there's resistance

802.079 --> 807.54
but I'm I'm Gonna Keep on doing it in

805.139 --> 809.76
the good faith that

807.54 --> 812.459
I'm doing the right thing

809.76 --> 814.38
that I'm providing an extra tool that's

812.459 --> 816.959
very hard to attain

814.38 --> 820.5
that other people's

816.959 --> 822.0
other people may have the opportunity to

820.5 --> 825.0
actually take it

822.0 --> 827.639
right when if there was no example

825.0 --> 830.04
whatsoever frequency wise or

827.639 --> 833.699
mechanically described

830.04 --> 835.8
then people would just never even know

833.699 --> 837.3599999999999
there was another tool there was another

835.8 --> 840.12
way

837.36 --> 841.38
and they would just see the standard

840.12 --> 844.5
ways

841.38 --> 846.66
as something that isn't really there

844.5 --> 850.519
because it's normal

846.66 --> 850.519
as as a lack of alternative

850.68 --> 853.16
right

854.94 --> 858.139
what's up in Chad

858.54 --> 861.62
what's going on

865.86 --> 868.5600000000001
wow

867.12 --> 871.04
that

868.56 --> 871.04
what

871.62 --> 876.42
okay my chat in YouTube was completely

874.92 --> 878.76
stuck

876.42 --> 881.88
and I was one I was looking at the jet

878.76 --> 884.279
in the hangout and it was like way

881.88 --> 887.279
further than the chat that it was

884.279 --> 891.4399999999999
actually showing on YouTube it's really

887.279 --> 891.4399999999999
weird and I have to read it all back

894.779 --> 897.5
uh

898.5 --> 903.56
hello Tom Parker Michael O'Rourke Amanda

901.139 --> 903.5600000000001
Jung

904.92 --> 912.68
M Stern

907.8 --> 912.68
hairy looks beautiful today okay yeah

912.72 --> 916.339
uh George Sanford

919.56 --> 926.0
oh

921.66 --> 926.0
I'm stood it's a bit of a special boy

927.48 --> 931.16
no time for this nonsense

935.519 --> 942.98
right so for starters don't forget to uh

939.42 --> 942.9799999999999
to rogans it up

943.56 --> 949.92
I would appreciate if the guys gals the

947.399 --> 952.279
familiars when they come in just upload

949.92 --> 952.279
the show

953.399 --> 957.48
that would be great

955.38 --> 959.9399999999999
because the trolls do that [ __ ] with the

957.48 --> 962.839
downvoting not that it really matters

959.94 --> 962.839
it's just

965.579 --> 970.279
it's just nicer that way for me

971.04 --> 973.699
anyway

978.0 --> 984.38
George Sanford say

981.3 --> 984.38
ready for what

991.8 --> 998.0
movement going on in Israel and Egypt

994.5 --> 998.0
what does that mean AGM

998.759 --> 1003.88
oh hello slo-mo moon buggy and yeah

1001.579 --> 1003.88
thanks

1005.24 --> 1008.24
foreign

1019.22 --> 1022.22
Sanford

1039.199 --> 1045.919
right anyway yesterday flutters debates

1043.579 --> 1047.6399999999999
it was pretty good but I was not very

1045.919 --> 1050.689
active

1047.64 --> 1050.689
[Music]

1050.72 --> 1053.26
I think

1054.32 --> 1058.8799999999999
it's difficult

1056.0 --> 1060.62
I guess that yesterday I did not have a

1058.88 --> 1064.5200000000002
lot of

1060.62 --> 1067.6999999999998
view on myself in the moment as much I

1064.52 --> 1070.22
don't know that happens sometimes

1067.7 --> 1071.299
it didn't have a proper I was carried

1070.22 --> 1074.24
along

1071.299 --> 1078.799
by another Sensation that was not

1074.24 --> 1080.6
focused on just how I was in the moment

1078.799 --> 1082.52
myself

1080.6 --> 1086.6789999999999
so you could say I was a little

1082.52 --> 1086.679
distracted to keep it simple

1087.14 --> 1090.6200000000001
uh

1088.34 --> 1091.76
and that happens more often by the way

1090.62 --> 1094.3999999999999
not

1091.76 --> 1096.799
not super regularly but it happens

1094.4 --> 1100.039
periodically

1096.799 --> 1101.48
oh yeah uh own Benjamin over at Gary and

1100.039 --> 1104.6
Terry

1101.48 --> 1108.039
was yeah it was kind of amusing Crow

1104.6 --> 1108.039
triple seven was on there

1108.14 --> 1114.0200000000002
and yeah that was a good show

1111.2 --> 1116.78
overall

1114.02 --> 1119.12
always get a yeah

1116.78 --> 1121.3999999999999
get a bit bored with the geometry of

1119.12 --> 1123.9799999999998
stuff though but yeah that's my issue

1121.4 --> 1126.14
you know yeah I know oh Arwen has a

1123.98 --> 1128.6
problem with everybody nobody's good

1126.14 --> 1133.1200000000001
enough for Irwin now they are

1128.6 --> 1133.12
you know just like yesterday with

1134.24 --> 1136.9
uh

1138.2 --> 1142.88
wakey wakey

1139.94 --> 1144.8600000000001
think he's pretty cool guy

1142.88 --> 1149.24
that

1144.86 --> 1152.6599999999999
like it's a bit of ADHD issues and like

1149.24 --> 1154.52
I that's just stands out to me

1152.66 --> 1158.3600000000001
and it's yeah it makes it a little

1154.52 --> 1162.22
harder to digest but overall great

1158.36 --> 1162.2199999999998
he's definitely on top of things

1163.88 --> 1169.46
right and Crow triple seven also like

1166.4 --> 1173.1200000000001
yeah great storyteller

1169.46 --> 1174.98
it's a very nice energy to him

1173.12 --> 1179.84
and

1174.98 --> 1182.179
very stable it's very stable person

1179.84 --> 1185.48
but at the same time yeah constant

1182.179 --> 1187.46
geometry and it it bores me

1185.48 --> 1190.1
right you know it's

1187.46 --> 1192.76
I've tried to think of a good way to

1190.1 --> 1192.76
explain it

1195.38 --> 1201.5800000000002
is that geometry like in the virtual

1197.96 --> 1201.58
realm is a certain mechanism

1201.98 --> 1207.2
and

1204.08 --> 1208.76
yeah it has workings to it yes it

1207.2 --> 1212.1200000000001
definitely Reveals All Kinds of

1208.76 --> 1215.6
connections mechanically within creation

1212.12 --> 1216.86
and just the numerical extract and all

1215.6 --> 1219.86
that and

1216.86 --> 1223.58
and and yeah energy reflections of that

1219.86 --> 1225.62
problem is though that it takes up a lot

1223.58 --> 1229.52
of attention like when you get good at

1225.62 --> 1230.78
it it starts to ingrain itself and I can

1229.52 --> 1233.24
prove

1230.78 --> 1235.34
that it

1233.24 --> 1237.32
it keeps you stuck

1235.34 --> 1241.3999999999999
in a certain

1237.32 --> 1243.98
way of thinking and then that deflects

1241.4 --> 1246.2
your intention instead of certain types

1243.98 --> 1249.5
of moments if you don't do that

1246.2 --> 1251.72
where a lot more detail like in that

1249.5 --> 1254.539
essential moment is revealed

1251.72 --> 1257.0
so that's why I've always prevented

1254.539 --> 1258.799
geometry like I started to figure this

1257.0 --> 1261.14
out really young because

1258.799 --> 1264.2
when I engaged in it and I'm very

1261.14 --> 1265.4
sensitive because I I was fascinated by

1264.2 --> 1267.26
it

1265.4 --> 1270.02
but also

1267.26 --> 1271.22
and engage with trying to think like

1270.02 --> 1273.86
that

1271.22 --> 1276.919
like I could feel it having an influence

1273.86 --> 1278.9599999999998
on like the pull of my mind

1276.919 --> 1282.7990000000002
on the Stillness of it

1278.96 --> 1284.659
and that felt like it was going to

1282.799 --> 1286.8799999999999
basically take away certain

1284.659 --> 1291.0200000000002
opportunities

1286.88 --> 1296.7990000000002
right not because of the content

1291.02 --> 1296.799
but because of the thought mechanism

1297.2 --> 1302.539
I don't know if anybody understands what

1299.48 --> 1303.98
I'm saying right now I hope they do this

1302.539 --> 1306.74
is

1303.98 --> 1308.9
I don't know who's listening

1306.74 --> 1312.08
I wonder like would Owen Benjamin get

1308.9 --> 1314.48
what I was just trying to explain and if

1312.08 --> 1317.5
he did would he give a [ __ ]

1314.48 --> 1317.5
I doubt it

1322.28 --> 1328.36
I think he likes it

1325.52 --> 1328.36
and then again

1328.82 --> 1332.2
it doesn't really matter

1333.62 --> 1338.299
he has his own way of doing things his

1336.2 --> 1341.559
own path and his own challenges and so

1338.299 --> 1341.559
do I in my own way

1345.02 --> 1351.3799999999999
and maybe from the principles he own

1349.34 --> 1356.299
Benjamin is trying to uphold and keep

1351.38 --> 1358.7
strong maybe when he reflects upon me if

1356.299 --> 1361.22
he's ever done that

1358.7 --> 1364.46
he might have I have been very active in

1361.22 --> 1367.159
his chat like up until a year ago

1364.46 --> 1369.559
through D life and he would actually

1367.159 --> 1371.98
read it and so he knows kind of my

1369.559 --> 1371.98
presence

1372.02 --> 1377.6
I don't know if he actually look deeper

1374.0 --> 1381.679
into it if he did then he might

1377.6 --> 1383.9599999999998
feel like I'm a spiritual opponent to

1381.679 --> 1386.0
his principles

1383.96 --> 1388.4
and then

1386.0 --> 1391.22
basically choose not to entangle because

1388.4 --> 1393.3200000000002
of it so it did that's it might be the

1391.22 --> 1394.64
reason why he might dislike me okay I'm

1393.32 --> 1397.6399999999999
now

1394.64 --> 1400.8200000000002
yeah oracling

1397.64 --> 1404.3100000000002
all these details about somebody that is

1400.82 --> 1411.02
literally out there but I don't know

1404.31 --> 1411.02
[Music]

1416.24 --> 1420.5
geometry is not my medium either okay

1418.34 --> 1424.6
well thank you start seeking star water

1420.5 --> 1427.58
I really really want to thank you

1424.6 --> 1430.1
for being very supporting

1427.58 --> 1432.32
also yesterday

1430.1 --> 1435.3799999999999
for just giving some recognition because

1432.32 --> 1439.1789999999999
sometimes I feel like literally nobody

1435.38 --> 1439.179
in the world is gonna understand me

1439.58 --> 1445.3999999999999
makes me feel very isolated and gets me

1442.34 --> 1450.4399999999998
a bit anxious eventually and yeah your

1445.4 --> 1452.96
presence and your proof of understanding

1450.44 --> 1456.559
a reflection right you can't just say oh

1452.96 --> 1459.38
yeah yeah or when oh you're cool no

1456.559 --> 1461.8999999999999
actually understanding it and showing

1459.38 --> 1463.5200000000002
that for what you're saying it helps me

1461.9 --> 1466.3400000000001
a lot

1463.52 --> 1468.559
helps me a lot give give me less of a

1466.34 --> 1472.6589999999999
feeling like I'm just

1468.559 --> 1472.6589999999999
throwing pearls for swines everywhere

1474.02 --> 1480.52
so thank you very much for that seeking

1476.659 --> 1480.5200000000002
star water and and support

1484.72 --> 1492.88
hello by the way and Tiny Womble in chat

1490.7 --> 1492.88
foreign

1498.44 --> 1501.039
so

1501.14 --> 1504.159
I also

1505.52 --> 1510.94
had a really extensive call with my

1508.52 --> 1510.94
healer

1512.0 --> 1518.0
where I basically at some point asked

1514.88 --> 1520.0590000000002
like an analytical readout and it was

1518.0 --> 1523.82
shocked

1520.059 --> 1526.039
shocked like really and I don't get

1523.82 --> 1527.8999999999999
shocked easily I was shocked by the

1526.039 --> 1530.96
detail

1527.9 --> 1533.659
of the analysis readout

1530.96 --> 1535.1000000000001
like now talking like a pretty heavy

1533.659 --> 1536.5390000000002
spiritual things

1535.1 --> 1539.48
as in

1536.539 --> 1542.9
he uses his guides it's a very specific

1539.48 --> 1546.02
mechanism it's kind of surreal it was

1542.9 --> 1547.88
it's like as surreal as the German new

1546.02 --> 1550.279
medicine mechanism

1547.88 --> 1552.38
but they are compatible

1550.279 --> 1556.039
like they're basically of the same

1552.38 --> 1558.5590000000002
mechanism it's it's something else man

1556.039 --> 1562.52
but yeah he used his guides to basically

1558.559 --> 1565.1
size up certain of my skills

1562.52 --> 1568.52
like my

1565.1 --> 1572.24
Clairvoyant ability which I do have

1568.52 --> 1575.0
and even as when I shared with him

1572.24 --> 1578.48
like yeah I I feel like I'm an Oracle

1575.0 --> 1582.2
and at describing the mechanism how I do

1578.48 --> 1587.179
that get a question then latch on to

1582.2 --> 1589.94
that and then like the gates open up and

1587.179 --> 1592.88
something else like

1589.94 --> 1594.98
my guides

1592.88 --> 1596.9
my guides are the ones actually

1594.98 --> 1599.179
answering these things

1596.9 --> 1602.0590000000002
like and they are part of me they are

1599.179 --> 1603.799
with me like everybody has that

1602.059 --> 1607.1589999999999
but I've

1603.799 --> 1608.36
like yeah so many detailed questions and

1607.159 --> 1610.7
answers

1608.36 --> 1612.86
like and this is kind of it's kind of

1610.7 --> 1615.8600000000001
weirded me out a little I'm almost

1612.86 --> 1619.3999999999999
nervous relaying the details but for

1615.86 --> 1621.9799999999998
example when I said to my healer like

1619.4 --> 1624.44
yeah it's oracling

1621.98 --> 1628.58
he was just like yeah that's exactly

1624.44 --> 1629.679
what it is dude it's really holy [ __ ] I

1628.58 --> 1634.48
was right

1629.679 --> 1634.48
like yeah that's what it is and

1634.88 --> 1640.0
what happens is

1637.1 --> 1640.0
I'm there

1640.039 --> 1645.5
I am me

1641.779 --> 1647.72
I'm kind of entertaining a bit but there

1645.5 --> 1650.179
is this mechanism answering questions

1647.72 --> 1653.48
and when it happens

1650.179 --> 1656.44
like I have a gate to open and through

1653.48 --> 1656.44
that gate comes

1657.02 --> 1662.36
yeah my guides

1659.48 --> 1664.46
that are another extension of me they're

1662.36 --> 1666.9799999999998
like in the other room

1664.46 --> 1669.679
you could say

1666.98 --> 1673.7
like in in the spiritual dimension

1669.679 --> 1678.5590000000002
and they have a lot they have less

1673.7 --> 1681.1000000000001
strain also from the conscious

1678.559 --> 1685.279
seating me

1681.1 --> 1688.52
from me that's actually constantly here

1685.279 --> 1692.6
and they provide answers and they do it

1688.52 --> 1696.46
very very well and they also know how to

1692.6 --> 1699.559
use my Clairvoyant skills so apparently

1696.46 --> 1702.8600000000001
I have a lot of it

1699.559 --> 1705.559
like I was shocked to hear how much

1702.86 --> 1709.039
like shocked and I

1705.559 --> 1712.1589999999999
it's like different senses have like

1709.039 --> 1714.7
clear Clear Vision clear hearing clear

1712.159 --> 1714.7
smell

1714.919 --> 1719.419
and yeah

1716.72 --> 1723.58
I was pretty high on certain skills my

1719.419 --> 1723.5800000000002
vision was the lowest of them all

1723.62 --> 1729.9399999999998
and and that kind of makes sense because

1725.899 --> 1729.9399999999998
my vision really is like

1730.34 --> 1735.5
it's a support function to me

1733.64 --> 1738.5
because apparently my hearing and my

1735.5 --> 1741.1
smell is pretty incredible with the

1738.5 --> 1741.1
associated

1741.26 --> 1746.799
Realms one could say like how that works

1747.98 --> 1753.8600000000001
like yeah so I got basically like a

1751.1 --> 1755.4189999999999
readout like that I've never had it

1753.86 --> 1757.4599999999998
before

1755.419 --> 1759.679
from him even though I know him for

1757.46 --> 1762.5
years but I was finally kind of like

1759.679 --> 1765.74
confident and ready to hear the readout

1762.5 --> 1768.38
and I really needed that

1765.74 --> 1770.1200000000001
because I've had a lot of build up

1768.38 --> 1772.5800000000002
self-doubt

1770.12 --> 1775.4599999999998
about what I do and just people

1772.58 --> 1777.4399999999998
responding to me and basically me

1775.46 --> 1779.1200000000001
gaslighting myself

1777.44 --> 1782.24
like

1779.12 --> 1784.8799999999999
am I the right guy here am I doing the

1782.24 --> 1788.38
right thing by upholding my principles

1784.88 --> 1788.38
of like brutal honesty

1789.919 --> 1795.3200000000002
like am I still doing the right thing

1792.799 --> 1797.6589999999999
you know it's my principles

1795.32 --> 1801.08
but how I carry out these principles

1797.659 --> 1803.8400000000001
that is something I have to size up am I

1801.08 --> 1806.539
doing it right

1803.84 --> 1808.8799999999999
I have a lot of doubts built up you know

1806.539 --> 1811.94
other than a lot of people

1808.88 --> 1814.22
don't really know how to deal with me in

1811.94 --> 1817.88
certain ways or

1814.22 --> 1821.659
get it a bit awkward in my presence

1817.88 --> 1823.46
that's really unnerving to me and you

1821.659 --> 1824.8990000000001
can't help that if if you're listening

1823.46 --> 1826.64
and you

1824.899 --> 1831.799
've figured out like oh yeah I have that

1826.64 --> 1834.6200000000001
this it's okay I'm not blaming you man I

1831.799 --> 1838.039
am weird I am Arwin and I am freaking

1834.62 --> 1842.02
weird I get it man I get it

1838.039 --> 1842.02
can be a little unnerving sometimes

1842.179 --> 1846.0800000000002
and

1843.5 --> 1849.26
I tell you it's not all benefit it's

1846.08 --> 1851.96
definitely problematic especially when I

1849.26 --> 1855.399
try to get closer to new people in the

1851.96 --> 1855.3990000000001
physical world out here

1855.5 --> 1859.539
I usually break out in sweat

1859.58 --> 1867.08
because it's like oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] are

1862.76 --> 1869.6
they ready how far can I reveal myself

1867.08 --> 1872.96
like like I don't really know at the

1869.6 --> 1875.6589999999999
start until I basically start

1872.96 --> 1878.32
revealing things

1875.659 --> 1878.3200000000002
uh

1879.86 --> 1885.9189999999999
that aspect of you can be called your

1882.98 --> 1889.94
holy guardian angel that could call it

1885.919 --> 1892.7
that I I don't associate it with they're

1889.94 --> 1895.039
not according to my Healers

1892.7 --> 1898.94
Spirit cosmology they're not guard

1895.039 --> 1901.48
they're not 80 Angels they're guides

1898.94 --> 1901.48
it's different

1902.84 --> 1908.059
like they are specific to you

1906.2 --> 1911.559
it's

1908.059 --> 1911.559
in a way like there

1912.98 --> 1917.72
I should probably ask him about this

1915.14 --> 1920.72
about the origin of them but they're

1917.72 --> 1922.82
likely just like non-incarnated human

1920.72 --> 1924.799
spirits

1922.82 --> 1927.799
like another phase

1924.799 --> 1930.08
like perhaps it they are

1927.799 --> 1931.82
you're appointed to people

1930.08 --> 1933.6789999999999
after you die

1931.82 --> 1936.86
it's like another face

1933.679 --> 1938.8400000000001
before the next level whatever that's

1936.86 --> 1942.6999999999998
going to be something like that that's

1938.84 --> 1942.6999999999998
something what I think it is because

1944.72 --> 1952.64
they don't seem like angels

1949.039 --> 1955.279
maybe maybe it's just that it's a

1952.64 --> 1957.74
spiritual thing and just Angels is kind

1955.279 --> 1960.5
of an over generalization of good spirit

1957.74 --> 1963.2
right in that sense okay yeah sure you

1960.5 --> 1967.159
could call them Angels it's just that

1963.2 --> 1970.519
the Angels like a real angels and God

1967.159 --> 1973.279
that's heavy stuff man so I wouldn't

1970.519 --> 1974.36
call things Angels lightly in my

1973.279 --> 1977.63
experience

1974.36 --> 1980.7289999999998
right Angel is a heavy thing

1977.63 --> 1980.729
[Music]

1984.38 --> 1992.5390000000002
but maybe that's just me kind of making

1987.679 --> 1996.3200000000002
it yeah better distinction between

1992.539 --> 1998.98
the range within that Force

1996.32 --> 1998.98
uh

2003.279 --> 2007.899
all right but anyway yeah to kind of

2006.22 --> 2009.58
round out that

2007.899 --> 2013.059
little snippet

2009.58 --> 2015.8799999999999
I had some people analyzed and was kind

2013.059 --> 2018.1
of surprised I've had other yeah sorry

2015.88 --> 2019.8400000000001
if this feels like I might be inflating

2018.1 --> 2023.9189999999999
your privacy

2019.84 --> 2028.1789999999999
right to to get it cleared up I cannot

2023.919 --> 2030.88
meddle with you it's not allowed by me

2028.179 --> 2033.76
by my own principles but also as I even

2030.88 --> 2036.5800000000002
shared yesterday like

2033.76 --> 2038.919
the healing that my healer does you

2036.58 --> 2043.299
can't heal certain people

2038.919 --> 2045.46
because they are like taken in a certain

2043.299 --> 2049.48
way they are on a certain karakarmic

2045.46 --> 2052.179
path and like their condition is part of

2049.48 --> 2053.5
the process and you can't intervene in

2052.179 --> 2056.8
it

2053.5 --> 2058.419
it's really kind of like a destiny thing

2056.8 --> 2061.599
like that it's weird

2058.419 --> 2063.8199999999997
but that's how it works

2061.599 --> 2065.619
but I can get a read off a lot of people

2063.82 --> 2068.079
through my healer

2065.619 --> 2072.3990000000003
and it's really fascinating how that

2068.079 --> 2076.5
clears up certain ways of looking at it

2072.399 --> 2076.5
this has been extremely helpful

2078.159 --> 2080.52
right

2081.22 --> 2086.2599999999998
so I got it yeah I got a very

2083.98 --> 2088.179
interesting read of Owen Benjamin and

2086.26 --> 2091.079
I'm not going to lay that all down

2088.179 --> 2091.079
absolutely not

2092.139 --> 2096.52
most people will not really understand I

2094.599 --> 2100.1400000000003
don't think he would either

2096.52 --> 2100.14
but yeah

2101.079 --> 2106.1800000000003
it certainly cleared some things up to

2104.26 --> 2108.099
me

2106.18 --> 2110.56
things that I kind of already suspected

2108.099 --> 2114.54
it's just that yeah he's a Bard you know

2110.56 --> 2114.54
and he's a he's a great

2115.42 --> 2120.94
guy to

2117.16 --> 2123.8799999999997
provide certain types of dreams and ways

2120.94 --> 2126.78
of dealing with things and that

2123.88 --> 2126.78
extracts

2128.2 --> 2132.9399999999996
that distract from actually getting a

2130.599 --> 2135.2200000000003
better read but yeah that does not work

2132.94 --> 2138.599
with the guides

2135.22 --> 2142.54
they can just they're not distracted by

2138.599 --> 2145.02
human experiences like that

2142.54 --> 2145.02
anyway

2148.119 --> 2151.56
a sleeping Warrior

2169.839 --> 2175.72
yeah though when you have a powerful

2173.56 --> 2179.38
thought can have a huge resonance

2175.72 --> 2183.24
vibration on more than one dimension or

2179.38 --> 2183.2400000000002
or you could see it the other way around

2183.579 --> 2188.4
it's the the thoughts that are powerful

2188.5 --> 2195.64
fit

2190.5 --> 2198.339
patterns beyond your simple insight

2195.64 --> 2201.0989999999997
and when you then outgrow that original

2198.339 --> 2204.2799999999997
simple Insight then you start to Simply

2201.099 --> 2206.2000000000003
see how it fits in those things that you

2204.28 --> 2207.88
hadn't seen yet

2206.2 --> 2211.859
that's really what makes a powerful

2207.88 --> 2211.859
thought or an idea rather

2214.18 --> 2218.3799999999997
and yeah the another dimension is kind

2217.3 --> 2221.619
of

2218.38 --> 2224.859
the representation in that sense of

2221.619 --> 2226.06
things that will come represented in a

2224.859 --> 2229.3199999999997
dimension

2226.06 --> 2229.32
because you can see it coming

2230.8 --> 2235.5
if you know how to look

2233.079 --> 2235.5
anyway

2244.8 --> 2250.98
Blue Marble science has slipped up what

2247.599 --> 2250.98
what did what did he say

2251.2 --> 2256.56
all right a little rub age by the way

2253.72 --> 2256.56
good to see you

2263.43 --> 2266.5
[Music]

2269.15 --> 2272.9
[Music]

2280.9 --> 2283.32
all right

2295.13 --> 2298.349
[Music]

2313.66 --> 2318.2999999999997
all right yeah I hope you guys

2315.28 --> 2318.3
appreciated that

2318.579 --> 2323.7000000000003
anyway yeah the the reading was really

2321.4 --> 2323.7000000000003
awesome

2326.619 --> 2333.04
I'm just kind of like trying to clean

2328.96 --> 2337.5
slate again energy wise for myself

2333.04 --> 2337.5
took a necessary shower yesterday night

2342.16 --> 2348.0989999999997
oh yeah and overall my shoulder is

2345.52 --> 2351.339
almost completely healed there's still

2348.099 --> 2354.88
some like Remnant soreness

2351.339 --> 2357.16
because like it had been sore for long

2354.88 --> 2359.8
that's almost like you feel the edges of

2357.16 --> 2361.96
it still being a little sore but there's

2359.8 --> 2366.3390000000004
no more

2361.96 --> 2369.4
yeah there's no more muscle

2366.339 --> 2373.859
pull kind of situation going on so it

2369.4 --> 2373.859
seems like it's finally mostly over

2375.339 --> 2378.359
so what a relief

2397.0 --> 2401.079
right so

2398.74 --> 2404.2599999999998
any of you

2401.079 --> 2407.02
would you like me to expand on the

2404.26 --> 2409.1800000000003
spirit talk or you're kind of done with

2407.02 --> 2412.72
it now and

2409.18 --> 2417.3999999999996
want me to move on to the Ballers

2412.72 --> 2417.3999999999996
perhaps or Flat Earth developments

2422.68 --> 2426.0
let me know in chat

2436.54 --> 2439.599
[Music]

2441.94 --> 2447.28
Fe devs

2444.4 --> 2451.0
you mean definitely

2447.28 --> 2454.0
muscle pull spasm not

2451.0 --> 2457.06
no I don't mean I didn't mean sudden

2454.0 --> 2461.079
muscle pull it's just that

2457.06 --> 2464.92
if it's tightened it pulls it pulls you

2461.079 --> 2467.6800000000003
like it's not in a natural state

2464.92 --> 2469.9
right that kind of not certain pools

2467.68 --> 2474.24
yeah that would be a spasm thank God I

2469.9 --> 2474.2400000000002
didn't have that that would have sucked

2479.619 --> 2485.619
okay so now I'm divided jado wants me to

2483.46 --> 2487.7200000000003
talk about Flat Earth and brand M wants

2485.619 --> 2489.819
me to do more Spirit talk and by the way

2487.72 --> 2491.98
thank you for letting me know I

2489.819 --> 2493.0
it's good to hear that you appreciated

2491.98 --> 2495.04
that

2493.0 --> 2498.46
to me sometimes it's a little confusing

2495.04 --> 2501.96
because when I do that chat kind of

2498.46 --> 2501.96
tends to die down a little

2503.26 --> 2508.42
you're probably kind of like trying to

2505.3 --> 2510.1600000000003
tune into it and then are a bit

2508.42 --> 2513.9
distracted you get a little bit more

2510.16 --> 2513.8999999999996
stuck in your head perhaps

2523.24 --> 2528.4599999999996
right oh yeah slow mo moon buggy spare

2526.839 --> 2530.2599999999998
talk is fine I agree with your take on

2528.46 --> 2533.44
Gematria right

2530.26 --> 2534.96
people who dive too deep into geometry

2533.44 --> 2539.2000000000003
can make one

2534.96 --> 2541.78
a tad big cookie right you get stuck in

2539.2 --> 2542.98
it it becomes like an Escapist mechanism

2541.78 --> 2545.8
and

2542.98 --> 2548.92
also by the way

2545.8 --> 2550.48
like Owen Benjamin has

2548.92 --> 2552.46
like

2550.48 --> 2555.28
played into that

2552.46 --> 2557.079
like oh people getting obsessed with the

2555.28 --> 2559.3590000000004
numbers and then getting all nutty with

2557.079 --> 2561.28
it like he even made it kind of like a

2559.359 --> 2563.38
character joke

2561.28 --> 2565.9
but then he

2563.38 --> 2568.48
he does really like Crow

2565.9 --> 2572.02
and listens to him constantly so I'm

2568.48 --> 2573.94
then wondering like okay

2572.02 --> 2578.04
you find it kooky

2573.94 --> 2578.04
like people can get naughty with it

2578.079 --> 2583.44
but apparently you really like it

2583.96 --> 2588.04
because he's doing it a lot

2586.119 --> 2590.92
I don't know man it's

2588.04 --> 2593.2
it's a little mixed but yeah own

2590.92 --> 2595.119
Benjamin has a lot of mixed messages

2593.2 --> 2597.5789999999997
sometimes like that

2595.119 --> 2599.38
and it's it just feels to me every time

2597.579 --> 2601.2400000000002
like he's just testing the waters when

2599.38 --> 2604.06
he does that

2601.24 --> 2606.819
kind of like putting it down to see

2604.06 --> 2609.5789999999997
whether it is true or not that sort of

2606.819 --> 2611.02
thing and then hey how he comes to a

2609.579 --> 2612.52
conclusion

2611.02 --> 2615.099
you have to

2612.52 --> 2617.14
figure that out in how he unrolls

2615.099 --> 2619.7400000000002
because he doesn't always straight out

2617.14 --> 2619.74
say it

2621.42 --> 2626.38
right with things about for example the

2624.46 --> 2628.78
Trinity situation

2626.38 --> 2630.6400000000003
yeah then he gets very forward with it

2628.78 --> 2633.099
because a lot of people apparently Troll

2630.64 --> 2635.68
and complain to him about it or get

2633.099 --> 2641.04
obsessed with it and so he gets very

2635.68 --> 2641.04
upfront well all the details not so much

2641.14 --> 2646.42
Owen gives me bad vibes okay jado that

2644.68 --> 2649.02
doesn't sound great

2646.42 --> 2649.02
could be

2649.599 --> 2652.92
that yeah

2653.619 --> 2661.98
he does push it a little and that's kind

2657.94 --> 2661.98
of like part of what he does it's

2663.04 --> 2669.88
but I understand and

2666.16 --> 2673.1189999999997
I I understand this now better

2669.88 --> 2675.1600000000003
than I did before I had my the call with

2673.119 --> 2678.6400000000003
my healer yesterday

2675.16 --> 2682.7799999999997
so a lot of revealing details

2678.64 --> 2686.04
that I'm not going to share because it's

2682.78 --> 2686.0400000000004
for my ears only

2693.64 --> 2700.18
Crow balances geometro with facts well

2697.839 --> 2702.7799999999997
isn't often to angiometra

2700.18 --> 2702.7799999999997
right

2702.819 --> 2707.56
oh

2704.04 --> 2709.0
yeah I agree with that

2707.56 --> 2711.16
he's not

2709.0 --> 2713.619
drowning in it

2711.16 --> 2715.66
but try to find a conversation where he

2713.619 --> 2718.1400000000003
doesn't bring it up

2715.66 --> 2718.14
really

2718.48 --> 2721.38
I'm just saying

2722.8 --> 2728.079
all right so it's not just geometry that

2725.44 --> 2731.38
yeah that's what you risk

2728.079 --> 2733.1800000000003
but he I can't remember a single

2731.38 --> 2735.1600000000003
conversation where he didn't bring it up

2733.18 --> 2739.5
somehow

2735.16 --> 2739.5
so that is fairy telling to me

2779.02 --> 2784.02
hmm

2781.42 --> 2784.02
right

2790.54 --> 2794.4
hey Dutch sailor good to see you

2812.92 --> 2818.7400000000002
uh yeah he

2816.22 --> 2821.0789999999997
although stallion 8012

2818.74 --> 2823.6189999999997
I'm doing well today yeah I'm doing I'm

2821.079 --> 2823.619
doing fine

2833.02 --> 2836.88
and James two

2841.42 --> 2845.02
right uh

2856.0 --> 2858.78
okay

2863.68 --> 2870.04
yeah

2865.9 --> 2872.2000000000003
okay well James 2 is just yeah if people

2870.04 --> 2874.119
want to talk about Flat Earth and Amanda

2872.2 --> 2876.2999999999997
Jung seems to want to talk about that

2874.119 --> 2876.3
too

2876.339 --> 2879.119
and jado

2880.9 --> 2886.3
oh there's a question how do the Sun and

2883.9 --> 2889.2000000000003
Moon revolve around the Earth

2886.3 --> 2889.2000000000003
uh they don't

2891.819 --> 2897.839
they're not really things just lights

2901.54 --> 2909.4
never seen quantum levitation

2904.9 --> 2911.079
you mean the magnetic magnetic floating

2909.4 --> 2914.2200000000003
I don't even know why they call that

2911.079 --> 2914.2200000000003
quantum levitation

2917.44 --> 2921.7000000000003
who is responsible for the globe lie oh

2920.38 --> 2924.2400000000002
God

2921.7 --> 2924.24
laughs

2939.579 --> 2946.1400000000003
I think that the foundations of the

2942.819 --> 2946.14
globe lie are very old

2952.66 --> 2958.54
but yeah the way it's grown

2955.72 --> 2961.54
there's just a lot of people responsible

2958.54 --> 2963.9
for it by upholding it

2961.54 --> 2968.859
either through

2963.9 --> 2971.98
malevolent design and staying outside or

2968.859 --> 2974.319
by just being religiously a part of it

2971.98 --> 2976.9
and adding on to it not even realizing

2974.319 --> 2978.64
what that means

2976.9 --> 2982.92
you know

2978.64 --> 2982.92
the globe lie has a life of its own

2990.819 --> 2995.5
like it's a it's a migrating and

2993.16 --> 2998.5
refining idea

2995.5 --> 3002.359
a framework idea

2998.5 --> 3002.359
and it has a life of its own

3002.819 --> 3008.339
seeks out people

3004.74 --> 3011.16
to grow in

3008.339 --> 3014.359
to help it expand

3011.16 --> 3014.359
the design of it

3019.98 --> 3025.559
yes with science well yeah they're well

3023.22 --> 3027.9599999999996
when look

3025.559 --> 3030.3590000000004
they helped a lot

3027.96 --> 3032.28
for sure

3030.359 --> 3034.5
you could say they were like the

3032.28 --> 3039.26
foundational architects

3034.5 --> 3043.44
of the the mathematical and geometric

3039.26 --> 3048.26
systems that a lot of the globe

3043.44 --> 3048.26
religion rests upon for sure

3053.819 --> 3058.2599999999998
right and yeah sure you could all

3055.92 --> 3060.48
pinpoint it to a specific place an

3058.26 --> 3062.1600000000003
organization

3060.48 --> 3064.079
oh

3062.16 --> 3064.54
right but they're not gonna take it away

3064.079 --> 3067.63
though

3064.54 --> 3067.63
[Music]

3069.0 --> 3072.14
I don't see how

3076.98 --> 3081.96
number six is keep popping up in the

3079.38 --> 3084.44
globe yeah it's it certainly does seem

3081.96 --> 3084.44
like that

3086.23 --> 3089.42
[Music]

3094.98 --> 3103.68
right it is kind of like a domain of

3098.579 --> 3106.98
lies and I guess that 666 stands for the

3103.68 --> 3109.859
for Satan in that like it is a domain of

3106.98 --> 3112.92
lies and if you believe in it

3109.859 --> 3116.46
then you're going to be

3112.92 --> 3118.6800000000003
well reprogrammed by it for as far as

3116.46 --> 3121.7400000000002
you allow it to

3118.68 --> 3124.6189999999997
and in a way the 666 you could consider

3121.74 --> 3126.02
them as warnings as warning signals

3124.619 --> 3128.76
Within

3126.02 --> 3132.599
for people

3128.76 --> 3135.3190000000004
that have yeah have some observation

3132.599 --> 3135.319
talents

3135.54 --> 3142.4
like a warning sign like this is a trap

3138.78 --> 3142.4
that's kind of how I see it

3150.96 --> 3157.16
is intelligence in on it well what

3154.26 --> 3157.1600000000003
intelligence

3163.2 --> 3169.02
this is kind of a broad

3166.14 --> 3171.0
a broad group of people I'd say like

3169.02 --> 3174.319
what what is that

3171.0 --> 3174.319
can you be more specific

3191.7 --> 3198.18
yeah seeking star water I agreed

3195.599 --> 3200.6400000000003
I said that even on my show a couple of

3198.18 --> 3202.5
times like yeah even if they would say

3200.64 --> 3204.42
oh it turns out it's not a globe and

3202.5 --> 3207.26
then officially declared there still be

3204.42 --> 3207.26
Globe believers

3208.319 --> 3213.48
they just say okay the world's no no the

3211.68 --> 3216.1189999999997
apocalypse is here because they think

3213.48 --> 3219.0
the Earth is flat oh my God that's what

3216.119 --> 3222.599
would happen they're not just gonna oh

3219.0 --> 3225.5
okay so they just came out no they just

3222.599 --> 3225.5
not believe it

3229.2 --> 3234.0
but yeah

3231.72 --> 3236.54
like as I said the globe's not really

3234.0 --> 3236.54
going away

3237.54 --> 3242.84
it's a religion

3239.71 --> 3242.84
[Music]

3246.96 --> 3252.8
eia agency dedicated Main dictating this

3250.38 --> 3252.8
lie

3255.059 --> 3260.2400000000002
I doubt it Ralph Rodriguez I

3265.14 --> 3269.4
Maybe

3266.76 --> 3271.98
there is like agencies paying a lot of

3269.4 --> 3273.78
attention to information with children

3271.98 --> 3277.26
like that

3273.78 --> 3279.059
but other than that out there

3277.26 --> 3282.079
I think they kind of just leave people

3279.059 --> 3282.079
to their devices

3284.819 --> 3290.339
because they got probably mapped out how

3287.52 --> 3292.619
typically people would respond

3290.339 --> 3295.98
when they figure it out

3292.619 --> 3298.38
probably have a whole chart of like the

3295.98 --> 3300.0
discovery chart of how much is a lie and

3298.38 --> 3302.94
what will they bump into they probably

3300.0 --> 3304.559
already have that mapped out

3302.94 --> 3306.78
and then it can just

3304.559 --> 3309.2400000000002
size people up like okay where are they

3306.78 --> 3311.1600000000003
on the chart

3309.24 --> 3313.859
so in that sense yeah there's going to

3311.16 --> 3317.1189999999997
be people very well informed of how it

3313.859 --> 3317.119
works and what's going on

3320.52 --> 3327.68
that doesn't mean that they'll have like

3322.799 --> 3327.68
personal belief about it though

3340.38 --> 3345.7200000000003
Okay jump will be complete once everyone

3343.28 --> 3348.38
knows it yeah

3345.72 --> 3348.3799999999997
Maybe

3350.28 --> 3353.469
[Music]

3365.88 --> 3368.54
hmm

3372.72 --> 3376.98
right and then you yeah no dude if you

3375.839 --> 3380.2799999999997
don't wanna

3376.98 --> 3383.059
talk to Ballers and deal with them no I

3380.28 --> 3383.059
totally get that

3384.839 --> 3388.46
I don't blame you for that at all

3392.88 --> 3397.339
I mean I I feel the same sometimes

3408.42 --> 3413.599
right exactly like Dutch sailor says

3410.94 --> 3413.599
indeed

3423.96 --> 3429.359
yeah good points Carol Apple

3426.9 --> 3431.52
Moon craters being named after Jesuit

3429.359 --> 3432.72
astronomers and the Big Bang invented by

3431.52 --> 3435.44
lametra

3432.72 --> 3435.4399999999996
indeed

3471.319 --> 3476.7799999999997
yes stallion 8012 yet you're okay

3481.079 --> 3485.7000000000003
and you've been nice to me

3483.66 --> 3487.8799999999997
I don't know how you are to others

3581.579 --> 3586.3390000000004
two o'clock one more hour to go

3591.9 --> 3595.2200000000003
let me update some

3606.96 --> 3611.2200000000003
so why is it that we can't explore

3609.72 --> 3613.68
Antarctica

3611.22 --> 3616.8799999999997
it almost seems like they want to keep

3613.68 --> 3616.8799999999997
people from finding out

3623.579 --> 3626.1800000000003
probably

3631.02 --> 3638.7
now I see it's very likely that there is

3633.66 --> 3641.8799999999997
some habitable land somewhere there

3638.7 --> 3644.5789999999997
and they don't want us to find it

3641.88 --> 3649.2000000000003
because it's like their

3644.579 --> 3652.079
like the the secret Throne to them like

3649.2 --> 3653.64
oh the the elites

3652.079 --> 3655.98
the ones

3653.64 --> 3659.0989999999997
the thirds that all floated to the top

3655.98 --> 3661.079
like it's their secret Resort

3659.099 --> 3664.4
and they don't want anybody to find out

3661.079 --> 3664.4
or to find where it is

3665.339 --> 3668.359
something like that

3673.619 --> 3678.319
he

3674.94 --> 3678.319
little reichi

3682.4 --> 3687.359
quintuple

3684.14 --> 3691.7599999999998
quintuple five oh

3687.359 --> 3691.7599999999998
ah why does it have to be five O's

Richie 5-0

3720.66 --> 3726.319
the barber pole is not the South Pole

3723.9 --> 3726.319
what

3728.819 --> 3732.859
what do you mean with that seeking star

3730.559 --> 3732.8590000000004
water

3736.58 --> 3739.67
[Music]

3765.72 --> 3768.319
thank you

3771.24 --> 3777.6189999999997
oh right the South Pole is is fake well

3775.02 --> 3777.619
I don't know

3778.079 --> 3782.3390000000004
like is it an island

3780.359 --> 3784.2599999999998
I don't know the orientation you know

3782.339 --> 3786.18
I've asked these basic questions about

3784.26 --> 3790.92
the South Pole

3786.18 --> 3793.5789999999997
like okay if people are going to

3790.92 --> 3793.579
Sail

3794.099 --> 3799.559
go on a boat all the way around it in

3797.099 --> 3801.6600000000003
some fashion and then literally end up

3799.559 --> 3803.46
moving in One Direction ending up where

3801.66 --> 3806.0989999999997
they started

3803.46 --> 3809.7200000000003
well what's their gyroscope

3806.099 --> 3809.7200000000003
how's the gyroscope turn

3809.76 --> 3814.619
like

3811.38 --> 3818.339
did they actually go in a circle around

3814.619 --> 3822.2400000000002
it or did it go in a circle

3818.339 --> 3826.4
within it or did they move added up in a

3822.24 --> 3826.3999999999996
straight line which one is it you know

3826.98 --> 3834.539
so I just see Antarctica as a region

3831.48 --> 3837.42
I don't know it might hey it might turn

3834.539 --> 3840.96
out to be some kind of an island after

3837.42 --> 3842.819
all it I'm not excluding that

3840.96 --> 3847.02
doesn't mean the Earth is going to be a

3842.819 --> 3849.599
glow because it's still all very flat

3847.02 --> 3851.28
but yeah who knows maybe it is a flat

3849.599 --> 3853.6800000000003
ball

3851.28 --> 3856.7000000000003
and on a flat ball Antarctica would

3853.68 --> 3856.7
indeed be an island

3857.7 --> 3862.6189999999997
but yeah we there's just not enough

3859.859 --> 3865.7
information to tell

3862.619 --> 3865.7000000000003
not yet anyway

3880.28 --> 3884.8190000000004
advertise you can go to South Pole and

3882.66 --> 3887.96
see the 24-hour sun do they really

3884.819 --> 3887.96
advertise for that

3888.0 --> 3891.44
as I've never seen it

3893.099 --> 3897.599
this is one video

3895.14 --> 3901.14
where it was clearly edited

3897.599 --> 3903.2400000000002
that's it so do they actually advertise

3901.14 --> 3905.22
that I mean ballers in the trenches

3903.24 --> 3907.74
might just blabber their mouth of oh

3905.22 --> 3910.74
just go to the South Pole 24 hours they

3907.74 --> 3912.7799999999997
will say that does that mean that the

3910.74 --> 3916.22
people that actually manage those

3912.78 --> 3918.78
locations and the trips do they say that

3916.22 --> 3921.98
I counted out it

3918.78 --> 3921.98
I really do

3955.02 --> 3959.78
write your Sanford thanks I thought so

Ah that's a good one slow-mo moon buggy

4199.82 --> 4204.679

wait where are you finding that Batman

4229.52 --> 4232.06

4245.42 --> 4252.62
a 24-hour sun over at the Arctic region

4249.14 --> 4253.9400000000005
the North Pole regions

4252.62 --> 4255.62
but

4253.94 --> 4258.5199999999995
Antarctica

4255.62 --> 4258.5199999999995
I know

4260.36 --> 4265.12
ocean-wide expeditions

4262.58 --> 4265.12
right

4270.199 --> 4273.46
where are you finding that

4321.92 --> 4324.46
hmm

4338.02 --> 4342.52
swoop Antarctica really

4345.8 --> 4349.12
let me check that out

4373.9 --> 4380.0
you're saying these things but I don't

4376.64 --> 4381.56
see it are you just advertising for this

4380.0 --> 4385.9
[ __ ] now

4381.56 --> 4385.900000000001
because you make this claim

4386.42 --> 4391.42
okay

4388.28 --> 4391.42
I don't see it

4398.659 --> 4405.32
yeah well okay disproving what we claim

4402.5 --> 4407.84
oh really so where exactly is that

4405.32 --> 4410.12
experience 24 hour daylight in high

4407.84 --> 4414.9400000000005

4410.12 --> 4414.94
yeah where where is that

4423.32 --> 4427.299999999999
five reasons for Crossing

4432.86 --> 4436.36

4474.699 --> 4478.239

4557.32 --> 4564.98
nope I can't find it

4562.04 --> 4568.159
so unless somebody gives me a hyper

4564.98 --> 4571.459999999999
specific link to that exact place where

4568.159 --> 4573.32
they say it I Googled it with these

4571.46 --> 4576.46
Special sentences and all that and they

4573.32 --> 4576.46
can't you can't reach it

4585.62 --> 4592.159
five reasons for crossing the Antarctica

4588.88 --> 4594.46
experience okay it's in there at number

4592.159 --> 4594.46
four

4604.82 --> 4609.699
all right so they got it they're in the

4606.98 --> 4609.699
one sentence

4620.12 --> 4622.78
all right

4622.94 --> 4628.219
I wonder if somebody's actually gonna

4625.219 --> 4630.26
follow through on that

4628.219 --> 4631.76
because hey if you make that claim on

4630.26 --> 4634.159000000001
your website and you're going to

4631.76 --> 4636.679
actually pay for that they better damn

4634.159 --> 4638.0
well deliver that [ __ ] so you could film

4636.679 --> 4640.6990000000005
it

4638.0 --> 4643.96
and then say yeah they actually provided

4640.699 --> 4643.96
what they said they would

4660.14 --> 4666.04
can we call that sentence the Black Swan

4662.6 --> 4670.1
no no you can't just because somebody

4666.04 --> 4671.06
says it on a website that you can do

4670.1 --> 4673.58
that

4671.06 --> 4675.620000000001
right well I'd like to see the [ __ ]

4673.58 --> 4677.9
evidence then [ __ ]

4675.62 --> 4680.719
baller thinking you gotta win you

4677.9 --> 4684.0199999999995
[ __ ] [ __ ] tiny Womble you think you

4680.719 --> 4687.5
can slip that [ __ ] in here no no you

4684.02 --> 4690.7390000000005
don't it's still [ __ ] flat the Earth

4687.5 --> 4693.5
is flat it doesn't matter even if there

4690.739 --> 4698.599999999999
was a 24-hour sun over and act

4693.5 --> 4701.719
Antarctica right it doesn't matter

4698.6 --> 4704.3
right because the Earth is still flat

4701.719 --> 4707.42
yeah just because it's not the [ __ ]

4704.3 --> 4710.719
literal disc model setup

4707.42 --> 4714.62
doesn't [ __ ] matter but despite all

4710.719 --> 4717.9800000000005
that I still have only seen one edited

4714.62 --> 4722.78
stupid little video of supposing 24-hour

4717.98 --> 4725.12
Sun time lapse yeah one edited video wow

4722.78 --> 4726.679
it's very nice that some website out

4725.12 --> 4729.62
there

4726.679 --> 4731.96
is offering trips and then has one

4729.62 --> 4734.12
sentence that says oh yeah it's a good

4731.96 --> 4737.3
reason to go there it's for the 24 hour

4734.12 --> 4740.12
sun right well somebody can if they

4737.3 --> 4742.52
engage with this tell them you are going

4740.12 --> 4745.28
to show me the 24 hour sun and I'm going

4742.52 --> 4751.360000000001
to Time Lapse film it

4745.28 --> 4751.36
or false advertisement how about that

4755.179 --> 4760.76
oh far more well why didn't you present

4757.699 --> 4763.759999999999
one then because there's only one

4760.76 --> 4766.780000000001
there's only one I have not seen any

4763.76 --> 4766.780000000001
others right

4775.46 --> 4782.659
right and to me it literally doesn't

4778.64 --> 4783.679
matter it literally doesn't matter I'm

4782.659 --> 4786.44
just

4783.679 --> 4789.679
going by the data

4786.44 --> 4792.32
right and the claims people make based

4789.679 --> 4796.84
on their beliefs and their polarized

4792.32 --> 4796.84
struggle between two false dichotomies

4797.12 --> 4800.86
I'm just going by the data

4801.38 --> 4808.34
so if you got some data to back up 24

4805.219 --> 4810.82
hours on Antarctica that would be great

4808.34 --> 4813.5
I'll accept it

4810.82 --> 4815.719
accepted I'll embrace it and I'll say oh

4813.5 --> 4817.88
look there is the video it's right there

4815.719 --> 4820.76
it actually is unedited it's a real

4817.88 --> 4823.6990000000005
video it's really 24 hour sun in

4820.76 --> 4825.9800000000005
Antarctica cool

4823.699 --> 4827.78
can we move on now it still doesn't

4825.98 --> 4830.178999999999
prove the Earth is a [ __ ] Globe

4827.78 --> 4833.08
retards

4830.179 --> 4833.08
still flat

4833.96 --> 4839.4800000000005
the lights

4835.82 --> 4842.36
the sun it doesn't mean anything it

4839.48 --> 4844.218999999999
literally doesn't mean anything it's not

4842.36 --> 4846.5599999999995
even a [ __ ] object

4844.219 --> 4852.219
it's just like

4846.56 --> 4852.219
that's it it's just light that's all

4876.639 --> 4883.28
just type 24 oh yeah yeah let's add on

4881.0 --> 4885.38
to that now why don't you give me some

4883.28 --> 4888.739
specific video

4885.38 --> 4890.900000000001
right one that's not the edited one

4888.739 --> 4895.04
instead of saying oh just Google it oh

4890.9 --> 4897.679
yeah yeah let's feed Google what you

4895.04 --> 4901.36
want everybody

4897.679 --> 4901.36
to Google no

4902.239 --> 4909.5199999999995
if you know it's there because you've

4905.239 --> 4914.138999999999
seen it with your eyes and not heard

4909.52 --> 4918.38
that it should be out there then you

4914.139 --> 4921.139
relay that observation based knowledge

4918.38 --> 4924.5
with us instead of telling us oh just

4921.139 --> 4927.4400000000005
Google it just Google no if you've seen

4924.5 --> 4929.179
it and not just bluffing that you think

4927.44 --> 4934.178999999999
it should be out there because you heard

4929.179 --> 4934.179
it somewhere then you reveal it

4934.82 --> 4939.08
and I don't give a [ __ ] we're on a

4936.679 --> 4941.3
Google platform right now yeah that's no

4939.08 --> 4944.239
excuse you're still a baller

4941.3 --> 4947.06
and I am presuming right now that like

4944.239 --> 4949.5199999999995
many Ballers do you're making a claim

4947.06 --> 4952.159000000001
about something

4949.52 --> 4954.860000000001
that you haven't actually confirmed with

4952.159 --> 4957.62
your own eyes and then making us Google

4954.86 --> 4959.0
it no no no I'm not gonna do that

4957.62 --> 4964.219
if you know it's out there because

4959.0 --> 4967.639
you've seen it then you share that video

4964.219 --> 4969.92
don't make us Google something that you

4967.639 --> 4972.58
presume should be out there

4969.92 --> 4972.58
all right

4980.96 --> 4984.31

4996.92 --> 5000.12
hey James Mason

[Music]

5022.179 --> 5027.219
Nathan has a website I think he had like

5025.0 --> 5029.32
a forum I don't know if he has a website

5027.219 --> 5032.88
though

5029.32 --> 5032.88
no let me check it out

5057.4 --> 5060.0599999999995
I don't know

5069.159 --> 5073.9
hmm

5071.199 --> 5077.219
that's it

5073.9 --> 5077.219
I said merchandise

5082.719 --> 5088.6
no I don't see it

5086.08 --> 5090.04
I think he has one he doesn't have it in

5088.6 --> 5092.08
his

5090.04 --> 5096.12
YouTube

5092.08 --> 5096.12
list of links

5096.34 --> 5101.8
he might have had one and then kind of

5098.38 --> 5104.86
like dropped it after uh

5101.8 --> 5108.12
QE made a website because I'm pretty

5104.86 --> 5108.12
sure that he has one

5110.08 --> 5112.98
right anyway

5119.5 --> 5122.58
be back two minutes

5184.78 --> 5187.259999999999
this

5208.42 --> 5211.1990000000005
foreign

5255.28 --> 5257.94
foreign

5308.86 --> 5312.42
what are you talking about

5313.6 --> 5316.6
volcanoes

5343.36 --> 5347.88
I I don't know what to do with that

5354.18 --> 5357.379
[Music]

5377.32 --> 5382.239
no I have never been to Tenerife

5382.96 --> 5385.679
nope

5413.5 --> 5417.46
nope nah I don't really remember having

5415.239 --> 5421.799999999999
ever been close to

5417.46 --> 5421.8
a volcano in my life

5423.76 --> 5429.3
I think I was as a kid I was kind of

5426.159 --> 5429.299999999999
scared of volcanoes

5433.239 --> 5439.36
like in the real world like drawings and

5436.96 --> 5442.179
film and all that of volcanoes yeah I

5439.36 --> 5444.099999999999
found that endlessly fascinating

5442.179 --> 5446.5
in the real world I was always kind of

5444.1 --> 5448.719
nervous about that

5446.5 --> 5451.36
you'd like the idea like oh it could

5448.719 --> 5452.92
explode any moment just unexpected just

5451.36 --> 5455.46
because you're there I don't know it's

5452.92 --> 5455.46
ridiculous

5457.3 --> 5462.28
but yeah I'd be interested in taking a

5460.3 --> 5464.52
look at volcanoes just to see what it's

5462.28 --> 5464.5199999999995
like

5477.34 --> 5483.12
yeah coral reefs

5480.28 --> 5483.12
that's awesome

5510.28 --> 5515.648999999999
foreign

5512.61 --> 5515.648999999999
[Music]

5521.639 --> 5526.5
Doom is a lovely place not really

5542.5 --> 5548.46
have I seen The Truman Show Ralph

5544.9 --> 5548.46
Rodriguez yeah of course I have

5549.58 --> 5555.5199999999995
like by now who hasn't

5553.179 --> 5558.34
um yeah in the Flat Earth communities

5555.52 --> 5563.46
come on you got to be really

5558.34 --> 5563.46
oblivious to have not seen that

5567.76 --> 5572.5
or maybe just through people describing

5570.219 --> 5575.639
it or seeing little scenes in it you

5572.5 --> 5575.639
know enough about it

5614.5 --> 5620.34
thoughts on the movie some truth to it

5617.199 --> 5620.339999999999
well that depends

5635.98 --> 5644.04
like what what type of Truth are you do

5640.6 --> 5644.04
you want to extract from it

5654.219 --> 5661.84
I mean if you're gonna lay an analogy

5657.84 --> 5664.6
to the waking up process

5661.84 --> 5668.1990000000005
like what it is like

5664.6 --> 5670.4800000000005
to start to wake up yeah in the place

5668.199 --> 5672.58
you've grown up in

5670.48 --> 5674.62
formed your identity if you then figure

5672.58 --> 5677.38
out like wait there's a lot of things

5674.62 --> 5679.8
wrong like or everything is wrong about

5677.38 --> 5679.8
this

5680.199 --> 5686.199
and the way you respond the human

5682.48 --> 5689.678999999999
instinct and all that yeah that part

5686.199 --> 5692.32
it expresses that very well

5689.679 --> 5695.219
that's the biggest part of the truth

5692.32 --> 5695.219
that is in there

5696.639 --> 5700.32
in my opinion at least

5739.56 --> 5745.42
Godzilla versus Kong yeah I I've seen

5743.38 --> 5748.0
that that movie

5745.42 --> 5751.1990000000005
is out it's like being reviewed by

5748.0 --> 5751.199
certain movie reviewers

5756.159 --> 5762.96
is it any good I don't know

5759.76 --> 5762.96
I haven't watched it yet

5763.06 --> 5769.56
I'll probably download it at some point

5765.4 --> 5769.5599999999995
and then see what I think about it

5770.679 --> 5776.86
right so temanoid if you're gonna say

5772.78 --> 5779.44
Kong throws a tree into his Dome

5776.86 --> 5781.619
that literally doesn't mean anything to

5779.44 --> 5781.619
me

5786.76 --> 5790.139
at this point so

5800.38 --> 5804.36
Sonic Rachel what

5804.46 --> 5809.76
we can buy serious starring between two

5807.159 --> 5809.759999999999
what

5826.139 --> 5830.219
okay that sounds a little weird

5836.739 --> 5843.299999999999
what relating what are you talking about

5840.52 --> 5843.3
dominate

5849.48 --> 5854.98
what are you saying that these creatures

5852.58 --> 5857.08
are like raised in a giant Dome

5854.98 --> 5860.159
container on Earth or something is that

5857.08 --> 5860.159
the setup like what

5860.739 --> 5864.718999999999
just throwing around words

5877.84 --> 5883.119000000001
Truman's Doman Kong right so but

5884.619 --> 5888.639
what is the connection

5886.6 --> 5891.46
is there any connection

5888.639 --> 5894.400000000001
I I basically just ask a question a

5891.46 --> 5895.54
spoiler question or less like oh are

5894.4 --> 5897.82
they in

5895.54 --> 5901.179
like a Truman Show set up like a

5897.82 --> 5903.759999999999
container to keep them in or something

5901.179 --> 5905.56
or not because otherwise

5903.76 --> 5908.56
his Dome

5905.56 --> 5912.84
makes very little sense to me

5908.56 --> 5912.84
they both have domes okay

5914.199 --> 5920.919999999999
but what does that mean

5917.139 --> 5923.32
is that like their cave very big domes

5920.92 --> 5926.32
and they can get what does that mean

5923.32 --> 5926.32
tamanoid

5927.699 --> 5933.299999999999
it's like they both have that doesn't

5929.92 --> 5933.3
[ __ ] mean anything

5936.52 --> 5943.119000000001
right in The Truman Show yeah there is a

5939.76 --> 5946.2390000000005
dome it's the studio it's the world the

5943.119 --> 5948.46
small world Studio he's in there he gets

5946.239 --> 5953.5
out it's the point of the story right

5948.46 --> 5959.1
are you saying Kong versus Godzilla

5953.5 --> 5959.1
is the same is it in a dome

5960.58 --> 5965.219
yeah a mini oh finally so

5968.199 --> 5974.94
you could have just said yes

5970.9 --> 5974.94
after the first time I asked

5985.6 --> 5991.1990000000005
it was about the inner earth Hollow

5988.42 --> 5991.1990000000005
Earth what

5997.9 --> 6000.5599999999995
what

6011.76 --> 6018.4800000000005
just a small part near the start right

6015.3 --> 6019.5
so it's kind of like Dutch sailor says a

6018.48 --> 6023.759999999999
hint

6019.5 --> 6026.82
to Hollow Earth like on the inside

6023.76 --> 6028.26
kind of like a bit like the jewels for

6026.82 --> 6031.94
an idea

6028.26 --> 6031.9400000000005
right going into the Earth

6032.04 --> 6038.46
so it was based on that it wasn't on

6035.159 --> 6039.48
Earth or did they come out of the hollow

6038.46 --> 6041.28
Earth

6039.48 --> 6045.0199999999995
from down there

6041.28 --> 6045.0199999999995
like oh God

6046.02 --> 6051.4800000000005
just never mind I'll just watch the

6048.6 --> 6053.639
movie when I when I can download it and

6051.48 --> 6055.799999999999
I'll just figure it out myself because

6053.639 --> 6060.4400000000005
trying to get some logical description

6055.8 --> 6060.4400000000005
out of you guys is just a chore now

6148.88 --> 6152.06
to this

6212.82 --> 6214.94
thank you

6231.179 --> 6234.08
what's that

6240.179 --> 6244.76
oh is that some live streaming site

6246.48 --> 6249.08
huh

6249.78 --> 6251.96
foreign

6264.659 --> 6267.379999999999
okay

6269.58 --> 6274.08
all right well if I feel like watching

6271.679 --> 6276.32
that later I I will thanks for the the

6274.08 --> 6276.32
link

6332.84 --> 6336.78
massive city-sized underground

6335.46 --> 6339.719
structures

6336.78 --> 6342.36
well yeah you're at Stanford look

6339.719 --> 6345.9
I think there's probably

6342.36 --> 6348.96
inner earth it's just not a hollow Earth

6345.9 --> 6352.4
just very big freaking

6348.96 --> 6352.4
Hollow spaces

6354.179 --> 6357.38
perhaps shale

6361.26 --> 6367.1990000000005
and who knows what's down there you know

6363.54 --> 6369.92
maybe they have like their own light

is

6468.68 --> 6471.839
[Music]

6475.86 --> 6482.159
it's not a lot of subjects like bouncing

6479.76 --> 6485.280000000001
around yeah we talked about Antarctica

6482.159 --> 6489.32
and the presupposed 24 hours Sun rather

6485.28 --> 6489.32
people's assumptions about that

6490.199 --> 6492.86
talking about

6492.9 --> 6497.48
The Truman show and Kong versus

6504.06 --> 6509.52
or Godzilla versus Kong I don't know

6506.94 --> 6511.379999999999

6583.5 --> 6588.3
