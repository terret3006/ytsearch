look

98.24 --> 102.88
at this it was

100.96 --> 104.72
it was really weird because in the

102.88 --> 106.32
morning i thought like oh it's it's a

104.72 --> 107.2
cloudy day

106.32 --> 108.24
but

107.2 --> 111.52000000000001
yeah

108.24 --> 112.72
those clouds are now over there

111.52 --> 114.96
it's like

112.72 --> 117.119
a big wall

114.96 --> 118.719
of cloud and haziness

117.119 --> 121.36
and yeah

118.719 --> 125.6
in front of that right here it's so

121.36 --> 126.84
incredibly clear crystal clear blue

125.6 --> 131.44
it's just

126.84 --> 133.52
astounding also where did the moon go

131.44 --> 135.35999999999999
i don't see it anymore

133.52 --> 137.68
it's been there

135.36 --> 139.84
like pretty much there

137.68 --> 143.20000000000002
in the last few days

139.84 --> 145.92000000000002
now i don't see it anymore

143.2 --> 145.92
where did it go

147.68 --> 150.0
weird

152.959 --> 158.48
but yeah it's quite beautiful

155.28 --> 162.16
up there right now so

158.48 --> 164.16
gonna be pretty sunny afternoon i think

162.16 --> 167.35999999999999
and also yeah

164.16 --> 170.319
almost no wind at all

167.36 --> 173.92000000000002
so it's a really nice day to basically

170.319 --> 175.92
be outside sit in a park or something

173.92 --> 178.95899999999997
great picnic

175.92 --> 178.95899999999997
great picnic day

182.84 --> 187.12
what

184.4 --> 187.12
what the hell

189.04 --> 193.44
what's going on here my webcam's acting

191.84 --> 195.68
weird it was doing that yesterday as

193.44 --> 195.68
well

197.28 --> 201.599
huh

199.2 --> 201.599
okay

202.159 --> 205.92
uh

203.44 --> 207.84
right when yeah

205.92 --> 212.11999999999998
did it freeze right when i was picking

207.84 --> 212.12
it up or when i was putting it down

214.08 --> 218.15900000000002
okay i guess it was right when i was

216.08 --> 221.28
picking it up great

218.159 --> 224.28
okay so let me show you again

221.28 --> 224.28
look

226.959 --> 231.28
see this big wall cloud

229.36 --> 234.4
in the distance

231.28 --> 237.04
that used to be right over my house here

234.4 --> 242.31900000000002
over my flat apartment

237.04 --> 247.519
and now it's super super blue

242.319 --> 247.51899999999998
like spotless super blue no trails

250.239 --> 255.92000000000002
oh by the way that was pretty cool that

253.84 --> 258.0
was at the store

255.92 --> 260.479
talking to somebody that worked at the

258.0 --> 262.32
store and they were and they told me

260.479 --> 265.52
like oh yeah today is such a beautiful

262.32 --> 267.199
day isn't it no chem trails like

265.52 --> 269.84
whoa

267.199 --> 269.84000000000003
awesome

270.0 --> 275.04
it's like every time somebody just

272.479 --> 278.88
says that it's like oh thank god at

275.04 --> 280.8
least they they get that you know

278.88 --> 282.32
today spotless

280.8 --> 284.08
yesterday there were no chemtrails

282.32 --> 286.88
either but it was still kind of cloudy

284.08 --> 289.75899999999996
but today just look at this

286.88 --> 289.759
just wow

291.12 --> 295.4
the wall cloud in the distance

296.96 --> 299.84
and the sun

304.56 --> 308.88
yeah pretty straight line for cloud

306.24 --> 311.759
indeed just palmer

308.88 --> 314.0
hmm

311.759 --> 316.47900000000004
all right anyway croc hello crockett

314.0 --> 320.479
first in chat slo-mo moon buggy jess

316.479 --> 322.08
palmer terret 306 crook uh

320.479 --> 325.479
yeah

322.08 --> 325.479
matthew hall

329.28 --> 331.59999999999997
right

332.639 --> 336.08
so

333.44 --> 339.52
i'm guessing that today i'm not gonna be

336.08 --> 342.639
as pissed off as i was yesterday

339.52 --> 342.639
because i don't feel that

343.52 --> 348.479
feeling inside which i had yesterday a

346.479 --> 350.56
lot

348.479 --> 353.039
it was weird too because i didn't even

350.56 --> 355.12
have it like during getting groceries or

353.039 --> 357.919
anything it was really the moment i got

355.12 --> 360.56
back it certainly was like

357.919 --> 361.84
wasn't even something specifically that

360.56 --> 363.52
had happened

361.84 --> 364.88
in order for me to get like that it's

363.52 --> 366.79999999999995
just like

364.88 --> 368.56
i didn't expect that it was like that

366.8 --> 370.72
but then

368.56 --> 373.84
when i opened up that can there was a

370.72 --> 373.84000000000003
whole lot of pressure

374.8 --> 378.24
right and yeah

378.96 --> 382.88
it kind of unnerves me every time i do

380.96 --> 384.63899999999995
that even though it is

382.88 --> 387.68
honest

384.639 --> 390.16
but yeah i think that it might have some

387.68 --> 393.12
therapeutical applications for other

390.16 --> 395.44
people to just see somebody

393.12 --> 399.039
that is feeling what they feel except

395.44 --> 402.199
they express it completely unrestrained

399.039 --> 405.36
right because i bet there's a whole

402.199 --> 407.12
load load [ __ ] load of people in the

405.36 --> 410.72
world right now

407.12 --> 414.72
that pretty much we're feeling like that

410.72 --> 416.47900000000004
maybe not as like insidious wind sidious

414.72 --> 417.68
like that but still

416.479 --> 418.8
that

417.68 --> 421.759
and so

418.8 --> 423.599
i've kind of made it my thing to

421.759 --> 427.599
express that

423.599 --> 430.4
unrestrained without just just being a

427.599 --> 432.479
foaming at the mouth demon for nothing

430.4 --> 435.75899999999996
right because yeah there's plenty of

432.479 --> 437.599
those type of lunatics out there

435.759 --> 439.599
you get to see them

437.599 --> 440.8
on the alex jones show with special

439.599 --> 444.4
clips

440.8 --> 447.36
crazy sjws yeah well i

444.4 --> 450.79999999999995
sort of do that except without just

447.36 --> 453.28000000000003
being completely idiotic and demonic

450.8 --> 453.28000000000003
about it

454.4 --> 458.15999999999997
i'm just

456.56 --> 460.96
angry

458.16 --> 460.96000000000004
for good reasons

461.12 --> 464.12
right

464.56 --> 468.4
it's every time i do that by the way i

466.56 --> 471.12
always kind of expect that my stream's

468.4 --> 475.87899999999996
going to be taken down and it isn't

471.12 --> 475.879
like even with 82 it wasn't

481.44 --> 484.599
all right

497.28 --> 500.28
so

513.36 --> 517.159
hey jeff gas head

521.68 --> 524.0799999999999
whoa

524.56 --> 530.0799999999999
damn level of observers pissed

527.839 --> 533.6400000000001
12 people

530.08 --> 533.64
damn that's

534.08 --> 539.279
oh i yeah i noticed i'm looking through

536.48 --> 541.04
the notifications and he did upload a

539.279 --> 544.08
video three hours ago

541.04 --> 544.0799999999999
i haven't seen it though

546.72 --> 549.72
huh

550.959 --> 553.279
yeah

553.519 --> 555.839
man

556.959 --> 560.8389999999999
so for

558.24 --> 564.48
it's kind of weird because literally

560.839 --> 565.2790000000001
nobody i know or that i have contact

564.48 --> 566.5600000000001
with

565.279 --> 569.279
has

566.56 --> 570.7199999999999
had that has happened to them

569.279 --> 573.04
but

570.72 --> 576.0
there's a whole bunch of people i

573.04 --> 578.88
haven't had contact with

576.0 --> 580.959
in a long time

578.88 --> 584.4399999999999
and they might i don't know if they're

580.959 --> 584.4399999999999
alive or not

590.0 --> 594.64
i have suspicions

593.12 --> 597.279
for yeah if

594.64 --> 599.76
somebody used to be my friend kind of

597.279 --> 600.56
not not kind he was my friend

599.76 --> 602.24
but

600.56 --> 606.0
he was like

602.24 --> 609.12
pretty insane liberal in ways

606.0 --> 611.2
not like super he was like an introvert

609.12 --> 614.24
liberal

611.2 --> 617.2
and he would be freaking stupid enough

614.24 --> 620.9590000000001
to take the facts and all that

617.2 --> 620.9590000000001
and he'd probably die from it

621.6 --> 626.24
so i don't know

623.04 --> 626.24
maybe maybe not

626.64 --> 633.1999999999999
but nobody i currently know

630.839 --> 635.9200000000001
basically yeah

633.2 --> 638.32
even got it right because

635.92 --> 640.7199999999999
the people that i still respect and

638.32 --> 642.48
consider my friends

640.72 --> 643.6800000000001
aren't that stupid

642.48 --> 646.399
yeah

643.68 --> 647.1999999999999
like they wouldn't be my friends if they

646.399 --> 649.839
would

647.2 --> 652.6400000000001
be like that i i dropped all the

649.839 --> 653.6800000000001
numpties from my life literally all of

652.64 --> 655.8389999999999
it

653.68 --> 657.8389999999999
i'm so glad that my dad's not one of

655.839 --> 660.839
them

657.839 --> 660.839
right

667.68 --> 670.16
anyway

670.8 --> 674.399
right

671.839 --> 676.6400000000001
it does seem though that there is

674.399 --> 676.64
like

677.92 --> 681.92
in the netherlands situation seems like

680.24 --> 684.24
it's pretty

681.92 --> 686.8389999999999
it's been neutralized the whole covet

684.24 --> 689.839
situation like there's no more

686.839 --> 692.24
rules they're still attempts from this

689.839 --> 693.6800000000001
disgusting government in in place right

692.24 --> 696.16
now

693.68 --> 699.68
to basically

696.16 --> 703.8389999999999
force through vaccines passport [ __ ]

699.68 --> 704.4799999999999
all that qr codes they want to do that

703.839 --> 706.9590000000001
in

704.48 --> 711.12
synchronicity with europe but like

706.959 --> 713.5189999999999
literally nobody wants that nobody

711.12 --> 717.079
except for pure power

713.519 --> 717.079
hungry politicians

717.2 --> 720.2
liberals

731.36 --> 738.0
ah that sucks to hear that jess palmer

735.36 --> 739.279
yeah a whole bunch you know

738.0 --> 741.44
like

739.279 --> 743.6
potentially

741.44 --> 746.48
my brother

743.6 --> 748.24
right and his wife

746.48 --> 751.9200000000001
who works

748.24 --> 751.92
in a bio laboratory

752.16 --> 757.8389999999999
i don't know on what but i got some grim

755.76 --> 759.519
suspicions that it's not gonna be all

757.839 --> 761.12
that great

759.519 --> 763.839
even though she

761.12 --> 766.32
i don't think she is an evil person not

763.839 --> 768.48
that i know her all that well

766.32 --> 768.48
but

771.68 --> 774.4799999999999
they could

774.56 --> 778.6389999999999
have been kind of

776.16 --> 781.76
peer pressured into taking it

778.639 --> 785.519
that would be disastrous

781.76 --> 788.24
i hope not i hope he still has like

785.519 --> 790.72
yeah the old the old wisdom that he used

788.24 --> 790.72
to have

792.32 --> 796.9590000000001
he hasn't like completely turned gay and

794.639 --> 796.9590000000001
all that

797.04 --> 802.48
i don't know i haven't really spoken to

798.959 --> 806.1999999999999
my brother in over 10 years

802.48 --> 806.2
which is kind of weird

818.0 --> 821.92
it is weird because it's just

823.12 --> 826.839
my brother was like

825.12 --> 829.199
kind of a

826.839 --> 831.839
conservative like in his teens and all

829.199 --> 834.88
that and twenties

831.839 --> 837.6
and i was the [ __ ] liberal i was i

834.88 --> 840.0
hate it i i hate

837.6 --> 842.399
i hate my freaking opinions from that

840.0 --> 844.56
time i hate it

842.399 --> 847.199
so stupid and i had to

844.56 --> 850.6389999999999
it was like oppositional defiance

847.199 --> 852.24
disorder driven even that i did that

850.639 --> 854.24
sucks

852.24 --> 856.0790000000001
i sucked

854.24 --> 859.92
should have been beaten up more when i

856.079 --> 860.7199999999999
was a kid i'm not i'm not even joking

859.92 --> 862.959
yeah

860.72 --> 864.88
if i've been beaten up more than maybe i

862.959 --> 867.88
just i would have snapped out of it

864.88 --> 867.88
earlier

870.24 --> 873.76
but uh

872.0 --> 874.959
yeah

873.76 --> 878.48
i'm

874.959 --> 881.1199999999999
safe to say i'm not a little liberal

878.48 --> 882.839
anymore i'm pretty much exactly the

881.12 --> 885.519
opposite

882.839 --> 887.9200000000001
fanatically like beyond

885.519 --> 890.48
what normal people would do

887.92 --> 892.88
and i wonder if my brother has now

890.48 --> 895.9200000000001
actually done the opposite and kind of

892.88 --> 896.8389999999999
turned into a typical

895.92 --> 898.56
dutch

896.839 --> 900.8800000000001
liberal

898.56 --> 903.279
which would be

900.88 --> 903.279
gross

904.079 --> 909.4399999999999
and i would absolutely not respect him

907.04 --> 912.48
for that at all

909.44 --> 916.32
i would be very angry at him

912.48 --> 916.32
as a brother if he has

917.12 --> 922.48
like actually angry at him angry enough

919.92 --> 924.8389999999999
to if he'd be acting like that to my

922.48 --> 927.6800000000001
face i'd probably beat

924.839 --> 930.639
him i would physically assault him

927.68 --> 933.4399999999999
that's the luxury of being family i can

930.639 --> 935.199
[ __ ] do that

933.44 --> 937.12
right

935.199 --> 939.12
so yeah maybe it's a good

937.12 --> 942.24
it's for a good reason that we don't

939.12 --> 942.24
really talk anymore

943.04 --> 948.639
i just i look i used to look up to him

946.079 --> 951.199
so much

948.639 --> 953.36
and i feel that like

951.199 --> 955.279
he's not that guy anymore

953.36 --> 957.04
that i used to look up to

955.279 --> 959.199
anyway i don't know

957.04 --> 961.519
i don't know

959.199 --> 965.079
i've talked to him in 10 years

961.519 --> 965.079
so i don't know

968.959 --> 971.8389999999999
hey borders boy

979.519 --> 983.199
and you can decrease the retirement age

981.44 --> 986.639
yeah of course

983.199 --> 987.7589999999999
they have to it's all going bust right

986.639 --> 988.839
this

987.759 --> 991.44
seriously

988.839 --> 994.24
retirement age

991.44 --> 997.839
what is that

994.24 --> 999.92
that kind of sounds like socialism to me

997.839 --> 1003.44
yeah retirement

999.92 --> 1004.8
government organized really

1003.44 --> 1008.639
what why

1004.8 --> 1008.639
why do you think that would ever work

1008.88 --> 1013.6
like seriously

1010.56 --> 1016.4799999999999
it doesn't work you know that 200 years

1013.6 --> 1019.9200000000001
ago there was no such thing

1016.48 --> 1022.8000000000001
yeah there was no retirement

1019.92 --> 1024.8799999999999
unless you were good at what you did

1022.8 --> 1025.9189999999999
and you built

1024.88 --> 1028.24
your

1025.919 --> 1031.679
retirement

1028.24 --> 1034.0
you built it you saved up for that yeah

1031.679 --> 1035.919
because then you actually know you have

1034.0 --> 1039.12
it

1035.919 --> 1041.76
and yeah if you let government do your

1039.12 --> 1043.6789999999999
freaking retirement and pension

1041.76 --> 1044.72
guess what's gonna happen

1043.679 --> 1046.72
yeah

1044.72 --> 1049.3600000000001
it's it's not gonna be there it's gonna

1046.72 --> 1051.6000000000001
be an empty promise

1049.36 --> 1053.9189999999999
and if you're unlucky

1051.6 --> 1056.9599999999998
some [ __ ] over at corporate is going

1053.919 --> 1059.2
to use pension money to freaking gamble

1056.96 --> 1061.1200000000001
and then lose it that actually

1059.2 --> 1062.72
officially happened in the netherlands

1061.12 --> 1064.2399999999998
here yeah

1062.72 --> 1065.76
seriously like one of the biggest

1064.24 --> 1068.16
pension funds in the netherlands

1065.76 --> 1071.039
somewhere in the 90s

1068.16 --> 1074.24
like an executive had like illegally

1071.039 --> 1075.84
taken the funds and and used it on stock

1074.24 --> 1079.1200000000001
market

1075.84 --> 1081.039
and then he lost like everything it's

1079.12 --> 1082.799
like oh oh yeah all that money we

1081.039 --> 1086.08
promised you oh

1082.799 --> 1088.24
it doesn't exist anymore i'm so sorry

1086.08 --> 1092.3999999999999
i'm so sorry

1088.24 --> 1092.4
yeah yeah that's what you get

1092.88 --> 1096.96
when

1093.679 --> 1100.24
you you allow to the government

1096.96 --> 1103.3600000000001
or a mega corporation to do that for you

1100.24 --> 1106.08
yeah oh they'll manage it oh it's so

1103.36 --> 1109.08
trustworthy oh

1106.08 --> 1109.08
yeah

1110.16 --> 1113.8400000000001
right

1110.96 --> 1115.6000000000001
so it would be better for literally

1113.84 --> 1118.559
everybody in the west

1115.6 --> 1120.6399999999999
if you literally dropped the [ __ ]

1118.559 --> 1122.32
idea that there is such a thing as a

1120.64 --> 1124.24
pension

1122.32 --> 1126.799
that oh if you're reaching age you're

1124.24 --> 1127.919
going to get that oh really no no you're

1126.799 --> 1131.52
not

1127.919 --> 1133.44
you shouldn't think about that right

1131.52 --> 1135.12
that's not the way you should arrange

1133.44 --> 1136.96
your life

1135.12 --> 1139.84
that at a certain age you're gonna

1136.96 --> 1141.6000000000001
expect the government to freaking fund

1139.84 --> 1144.72
you

1141.6 --> 1145.9189999999999
just because you're at that age no

1144.72 --> 1147.44
no

1145.919 --> 1150.64
no

1147.44 --> 1152.48
that time is over you want that

1150.64 --> 1153.6000000000001
there's going to be a whole lot of

1152.48 --> 1156.72
people

1153.6 --> 1159.76
are going to need to be executed first

1156.72 --> 1162.88
yeah they know they need to be cleaned

1159.76 --> 1165.28
out of government

1162.88 --> 1168.16
and in other positions

1165.28 --> 1171.9189999999999
corporate yeah before you could even

1168.16 --> 1174.24
think about some kind of a stable

1171.919 --> 1177.679
socialism-based

1174.24 --> 1179.2
funding because it's so [ __ ] corrupt

1177.679 --> 1181.44
up there now

1179.2 --> 1183.6000000000001
it's just hollow promises right because

1181.44 --> 1185.52
that's what happens with real socialism

1183.6 --> 1188.3999999999999
it starts out like oh all this wealth

1185.52 --> 1191.84
all this all this stuff that was won in

1188.4 --> 1193.8400000000001
battle and hard work and then over the

1191.84 --> 1196.32
generations everybody becomes a bunch of

1193.84 --> 1199.039
weenies

1196.32 --> 1202.0
right they don't do anything anymore and

1199.039 --> 1204.24
then guess what that same socialism that

1202.0 --> 1206.32
was so great all that wealthy yeah it's

1204.24 --> 1208.4
gonna be hollowed out because there's no

1206.32 --> 1209.4399999999998
more wealth there to actually provide

1208.4 --> 1210.96
for that

1209.44 --> 1213.76
and then it's just gonna be empty

1210.96 --> 1216.559
promises and hoping nobody will catch on

1213.76 --> 1218.84
until literally the entire social

1216.559 --> 1222.3999999999999
backing is a pipe

1218.84 --> 1224.9599999999998
dream and that's what happens

1222.4 --> 1226.5590000000002
it's what happens every single time

1224.96 --> 1230.72
historically

1226.559 --> 1235.72
and it's happening in england it is

1230.72 --> 1235.72
kind of happening in the netherlands but

1239.2 --> 1245.0
we're working on it

1241.12 --> 1245.0
let's just say it like that

1253.2 --> 1256.2
wow

1267.28 --> 1272.72
yeah derp alerted eat

1269.6 --> 1273.6789999999999
that's pretty pathetic

1272.72 --> 1276.4
yeah

1273.679 --> 1278.0
i mean i don't know why that wanker is

1276.4 --> 1278.96
even whining about what i'm talking

1278.0 --> 1283.2
about

1278.96 --> 1287.76
i mean i'm not expecting a pension

1283.2 --> 1287.76
you get it i'm not expecting a pension

1287.919 --> 1294.24
i'm ex what i have done throughout most

1290.96 --> 1295.6000000000001
of my life is actually invest

1294.24 --> 1299.039
to ensure

1295.6 --> 1300.7199999999998
that when i grow older i don't break

1299.039 --> 1303.2
down

1300.72 --> 1305.3600000000001
so that i can keep going and then

1303.2 --> 1309.28
hopefully one day i'll be so freaking

1305.36 --> 1312.3999999999999
old i'll just literally just drop that

1309.28 --> 1314.72
maybe at work even right

1312.4 --> 1316.159
because

1314.72 --> 1319.28
if you're

1316.159 --> 1321.1200000000001
like pretty old but you're still doing a

1319.28 --> 1323.6789999999999
job and you like that job and you're

1321.12 --> 1326.7199999999998
good at it despite your age

1323.679 --> 1328.96
that's great those people when they get

1326.72 --> 1331.1200000000001
fired or they suddenly get in their head

1328.96 --> 1335.44
that they need to get a pension and just

1331.12 --> 1338.799
retire they end up dying very quickly

1335.44 --> 1338.799
after that yeah

1338.96 --> 1342.24
so

1339.919 --> 1344.159
that's not a strategy i want

1342.24 --> 1346.08
for myself

1344.159 --> 1347.2
i'm not trusting on any freaking

1346.08 --> 1349.36
pensions

1347.2 --> 1351.52
like that

1349.36 --> 1354.32
i'm gonna want a pension i'm gonna have

1351.52 --> 1357.2
to build it myself somehow

1354.32 --> 1361.799
right now that's not really uh

1357.2 --> 1361.799
an option that's viable to me

1364.0 --> 1370.159
yeah buy gold yeah i was actually one of

1366.72 --> 1372.4
those guys borders boy that did buy gold

1370.159 --> 1374.48
in that time and i had a

1372.4 --> 1378.24
pretty sizable profit from it i like

1374.48 --> 1379.84
made a profit like 2 000 euros

1378.24 --> 1382.32
at the time

1379.84 --> 1384.24
but i completely lost everything though

1382.32 --> 1386.6399999999999
over time because i didn't have a steady

1384.24 --> 1386.64
income

1386.72 --> 1392.0
which is really annoying

1389.76 --> 1394.48
that that was the situation because i

1392.0 --> 1394.48
probably

1394.88 --> 1401.2
yeah if i somehow was able to stabilize

1398.0 --> 1404.0
my income at that freaking time then i

1401.2 --> 1406.4
would be potentially wealthy right now

1404.0 --> 1409.679
but i didn't because i was a freaking

1406.4 --> 1413.2
weenie i was like oh no i want to focus

1409.679 --> 1416.5590000000002
on art oh arwen you're so smart oh

1413.2 --> 1419.2
you're so wise yeah focus on your art i

1416.559 --> 1422.0
mean you have a lot of money then

1419.2 --> 1424.799
like don't try to actually stabilize

1422.0 --> 1428.08
that no just focus on your art oh what a

1424.799 --> 1431.799
great decision man you're so [ __ ]

1428.08 --> 1431.799
smart erwin

1441.279 --> 1445.12
at least i made a symbolics.net site

1443.6 --> 1448.08
that's like the only good thing that

1445.12 --> 1448.08
kind of came out of that

1456.48 --> 1461.3600000000001
it's all crazy you know if i hadn't met

1458.96 --> 1463.1200000000001
my [ __ ] ex-girlfriend

1461.36 --> 1465.279
i probably would have had a stable

1463.12 --> 1466.799
income because i would have had a job i

1465.279 --> 1470.559
literally

1466.799 --> 1473.52
at that time gave up a job opportunity

1470.559 --> 1476.08
that i was going to get i already got

1473.52 --> 1478.24
the green light for it and then i said

1476.08 --> 1480.8799999999999
oh i'm not going to do it because i i

1478.24 --> 1483.88
want to see my girlfriend you [ __ ]

1480.88 --> 1483.88
idiot

1490.88 --> 1498.24
it's like i had to [ __ ] ruin myself

1494.32 --> 1502.3999999999999
and i just i don't understand

1498.24 --> 1502.4
why the [ __ ] did that all happen

1503.25 --> 1506.319
[Music]

1508.08 --> 1516.32
i don't care another way good

1512.32 --> 1516.32
i wish it did [ __ ] happen

1516.9 --> 1520.169
[Music]

1525.039 --> 1530.24
this entire thing with my ex was a giant

1528.0 --> 1532.559
giant waste of time and money and

1530.24 --> 1535.919
literally

1532.559 --> 1538.0
i was ejected with freaking 5 000 euro

1535.919 --> 1540.8400000000001
debt okay

1538.0 --> 1545.2
that i still haven't paid back

1540.84 --> 1548.76
yeah yeah so that was so smart of you

1545.2 --> 1548.76
[ __ ] arwen

1568.08 --> 1573.4399999999998
right but who knows man

i'll never marry

1872.96 --> 1879.72
i'll never have kids

1909.679 --> 1913.919
ban that word

1911.76 --> 1916.64
i don't even want people to know that

1921.84 --> 1930.399
people talking about it it doesn't exist

1926.32 --> 1930.399
and i'm banning the [ __ ] word

1933.679 --> 1938.159
it's so

1935.2 --> 1938.159
disgusting

1939.53 --> 1942.72

good

1971.919 --> 1975.679
then do something about what the [ __ ]

1974.0 --> 1978.559
are you talking about

1975.679 --> 1978.5590000000002
getting inspector

1985.12 --> 1991.6399999999999
oh

1986.799 --> 1991.6399999999999
okay flatter stage thanks i will

2033.84 --> 2036.8799999999999
there to actually

2036.96 --> 2040.799
yeah to put first instead of yourself

2039.039 --> 2041.519
it's just nobody there's nobody out

you in front of myself i'm never doing

2051.04 --> 2054.919
that again never

2066.879 --> 2071.2
hey gadget inspector hey hey

2069.839 --> 2073.52
maybe

2071.2 --> 2076.0789999999997
you need to shut the [ __ ] up and stop

2073.52 --> 2079.919
talking to me like that or i'm going to

2076.079 --> 2082.48
ban you again i'm sick of your attitude

2079.919 --> 2085.7599999999998
yeah and if you're sick of my attitude

2082.48 --> 2088.56
then this is not your hangout you get it

2085.76 --> 2090.639
yet gadget inspector

2088.56 --> 2093.119
i don't like your attitude

2090.639 --> 2096.2400000000002
i don't i want it to stop or i'm gonna

2104.8 --> 2109.119
unbanned right well you're presenting

2107.04 --> 2110.96
that [ __ ] attitude again i'm done

2109.119 --> 2115.28
with it

2110.96 --> 2116.56
yeah don't [ __ ] tell me what to do

okay

2116.56 --> 2120.88
don't

2118.079 --> 2125.2000000000003
don't tell me i need to be on time don't

2120.88 --> 2128.079
tell me how i need to provide for myself

2125.2 --> 2131.2
you get it yet gadget inspector that's

2128.079 --> 2133.119
not your place to tell me

2131.2 --> 2136.0
you understand

2133.119 --> 2140.119
can i get a confirmation in chat that

2136.0 --> 2140.119
you understand that

2150.0 --> 2153.0
so

2162.88 --> 2165.88
uh

2176.24 --> 2180.16
if i want to be late and i'm late

2181.2 --> 2185.4399999999996
if i want to complain about being poor

2183.68 --> 2186.96
and back for money

2185.44 --> 2189.52
then i will

2186.96 --> 2192.8
if you don't like it

2189.52 --> 2195.7599999999998
and get the [ __ ] out oh oh

2192.8 --> 2198.32
oh look at this look at this look at

2195.76 --> 2200.6400000000003
that right here see

2198.32 --> 2202.1600000000003
let me read it out before i ban you

2200.64 --> 2204.48
gadget inspector

2202.16 --> 2207.359
seems that you are afraid

2204.48 --> 2211.44
of the work word work

2207.359 --> 2213.2
ue begging scumbag good luck with your

2211.44 --> 2216.56
[ __ ] up life

2213.2 --> 2217.5989999999997
goodbye gaddied inspector get the [ __ ]

2216.56 --> 2219.7599999999998
out

2217.599 --> 2222.56
and i will never

2219.76 --> 2224.88
unban you again you understand you

2222.56 --> 2228.88
[ __ ]

2224.88 --> 2232.1600000000003
you ass whole

2228.88 --> 2235.52
you can't tell me what to [ __ ] do

2232.16 --> 2240.1189999999997
and you don't have the right to give me

2235.52 --> 2240.119
lip in my chat [ __ ]

2253.72 --> 2256.7999999999997
[Music]

2259.2 --> 2265.1189999999997
who never supported me by the way yeah

2261.599 --> 2267.839
never gave me a [ __ ] dime

2265.119 --> 2271.76
that alone would be reason enough for to

2267.839 --> 2274.4
ban me just for that

2271.76 --> 2277.5200000000004
because you're a freeloader

2274.4 --> 2279.44
you're a social media freeloader you

2277.52 --> 2282.44
like the leech of things that you don't

2279.44 --> 2282.44
support

2289.359 --> 2292.359
ugh

2302.88 --> 2305.2000000000003
yeah

2305.76 --> 2309.92
ah thank you

2307.52 --> 2309.92
dude

2310.0 --> 2313.04
yeah

2311.44 --> 2317.2000000000003
that's nice

2313.04 --> 2317.2
thank you for the paypal flatter sage

2318.24 --> 2322.3199999999997
it's really cool you're telling me oh

2319.839 --> 2324.24
it's not a lot dude it is

2322.32 --> 2326.88
try not to beat yourself up

2324.24 --> 2329.1189999999997
for past mistakes bro dude i try not to

2326.88 --> 2331.28
but sometimes i just gotta freaking beat

2329.119 --> 2332.96
myself up over the [ __ ] that i did in

2331.28 --> 2333.76
the past just

2332.96 --> 2336.88
to

2333.76 --> 2341.599
keep myself sharp enough to never allow

2336.88 --> 2344.96
anything like that to happen again to me

2341.599 --> 2348.48
to never ever think again that i can

2344.96 --> 2350.079
just let it go and just improvise

2348.48 --> 2353.119
without

2350.079 --> 2356.079
long-term thought like i can never allow

2353.119 --> 2356.96
myself to compose myself like that ever

2356.079 --> 2359.3590000000004
again

2356.96 --> 2360.48
so i have to freaking beat myself up

2359.359 --> 2363.359
like that

2360.48 --> 2363.359
periodically

2363.68 --> 2366.3199999999997
i have to

2367.44 --> 2372.96
anyway thanks for the paypal flatter

2369.44 --> 2372.96
sage i really appreciate that

2375.2 --> 2382.04
and dude you're getting a wrench

2377.28 --> 2382.0400000000004
you've already even you paypaled me

2384.48 --> 2387.88
and you're awesome

2397.92 --> 2402.16
have you seen or discussed j told

2400.32 --> 2404.0
no

2402.16 --> 2407.24
i'm not even sure if i'm subscribed to

2404.0 --> 2407.24
jay tolin

2411.68 --> 2417.52
oh yeah i am

2413.68 --> 2417.52
apparently i don't get notifications

2420.0 --> 2425.839
measuring the distance to stars is that

2422.0 --> 2425.839
the video you're talking about

2426.0 --> 2431.359
that seems pointless

2428.72 --> 2432.72
there's no distance to the source

2431.359 --> 2434.88
there's no distance to any of the

2432.72 --> 2437.2
celestials

2434.88 --> 2438.4
i mean you could model

2437.2 --> 2441.839
things out

2438.4 --> 2444.48
as if they were a plane of stars

2441.839 --> 2449.0
parallel to the plane of earth

2444.48 --> 2449.0
but it isn't actually that so

2452.0 --> 2455.2
is that what you were talking about

2460.16 --> 2463.52
yeah borders boy that's okay

2465.28 --> 2470.7200000000003
i really like your input in my chat

2468.319 --> 2473.52
i like that you're like kind of a an

2470.72 --> 2475.7599999999998
actual right wing guy that really that's

2473.52 --> 2478.48
not just a brute

2475.76 --> 2480.8
but that is also like you're not subtle

2478.48 --> 2483.2
and i like that you're just like

2480.8 --> 2485.6800000000003
dang

2483.2 --> 2488.96
but with tact and i like that this is

2485.68 --> 2488.96
kind of what i'm trying to do

2489.119 --> 2493.4
in between my rage when

2510.319 --> 2513.68
he came to a distance

2515.52 --> 2521.04
yeah now i've heard of that but that's

2518.48 --> 2523.2
an older system it's it's the kind of

2521.04 --> 2525.839
the same practical tricks that the

2523.2 --> 2526.7999999999997
jesuits build the globe model with

2525.839 --> 2529.2
right

2526.8 --> 2532.5600000000004
so you could definitely think of the

2529.2 --> 2534.72
celestial sphere not to be a sphere but

2532.56 --> 2538.319
actually a plane

2534.72 --> 2540.8799999999997
a plane that just looks like a sphere

2538.319 --> 2541.68
parallel

2540.88 --> 2544.319
to

2541.68 --> 2546.48
the plane earth

2544.319 --> 2548.48
or globe earth and then oh it makes more

2546.48 --> 2550.48
sense because it's a globe and then it's

2548.48 --> 2552.2400000000002
a global star surround that supposedly

2550.48 --> 2554.4
even though it doesn't actually match

2552.24 --> 2554.3999999999996
but

2555.2 --> 2562.16
right but there is a method

2557.76 --> 2562.1600000000003
by which basically every star

2562.48 --> 2566.96
is anchored as

2564.72 --> 2569.9199999999996
the the point

2566.96 --> 2572.7200000000003
the position where it's exactly above

2569.92 --> 2575.6800000000003
the observer

2572.72 --> 2577.04
and then they take that point

2575.68 --> 2579.68
and then they

2577.04 --> 2582.079
yeah they coordinated a triangulate

2579.68 --> 2584.48
trilaterate whatever it with another

2582.079 --> 2586.7200000000003
point and then its angle right and then

2584.48 --> 2589.76
if you take an assumption of a certain

2586.72 --> 2591.04
distance for every for all those stars

2589.76 --> 2592.7200000000003
everything you're going to measure

2591.04 --> 2595.7599999999998
angular wise

2592.72 --> 2598.9599999999996
then it just somehow seems to work out

2595.76 --> 2601.28
as if it was a plane on which these

2598.96 --> 2602.2400000000002
stars are draped and all that

2601.28 --> 2604.0
right

2602.24 --> 2605.7599999999998
there is a system for that i don't know

2604.0 --> 2607.359
what it's called i've seen it though

2605.76 --> 2609.8390000000004
it's been discussed on the flat earth

2607.359 --> 2612.56
debate too

2609.839 --> 2614.319
so apparently it is a mechanism

2612.56 --> 2617.359
for

2614.319 --> 2618.16
navigators and all that where you take

2617.359 --> 2621.04
the

2618.16 --> 2624.72
celestial map which is a

2621.04 --> 2627.52
flat plane of stars parallel

2624.72 --> 2627.52
to the earth

2627.76 --> 2633.599
it's like a flat plane of all the

2630.88 --> 2636.7200000000003
singular positions of stars when they

2633.599 --> 2638.7200000000003
were exactly above you

2636.72 --> 2641.5989999999997
that's what the map is comprised of of

2638.72 --> 2644.72
all the stars and all that

2641.599 --> 2647.119
when they were above you and where

2644.72 --> 2648.3999999999996
yeah and that's the flat plain parallel

2647.119 --> 2650.7200000000003
to earth

2648.4 --> 2654.88
of the stars

2650.72 --> 2654.8799999999997
it's a mechanism it's not literal though

2655.599 --> 2661.0
it's just a handy dandy trick for

2658.0 --> 2661.0
navigation

2665.04 --> 2668.319
i hope that clears things up

2670.319 --> 2677.44
yeah because it's not

2672.4 --> 2679.599
42 4 200 miles away literally no none of

2677.44 --> 2682.16
it is there has no distance there is no

2679.599 --> 2683.76
distance to the stars or the sun or the

2682.16 --> 2685.7599999999998
moon or any of the celestials they're

2683.76 --> 2687.2000000000003
all holographic they don't have actual

2685.76 --> 2689.76
positions

2687.2 --> 2692.96
not even as an apparition do they have

2689.76 --> 2695.44
literal positions they're all

2692.96 --> 2696.56
in apparent position in relation to

2695.44 --> 2698.16
observer

2696.56 --> 2699.839
only

2698.16 --> 2701.68
and then when you change your position

2699.839 --> 2704.319
their apparent position changes too

2701.68 --> 2706.72
which makes them purely holographic and

2704.319 --> 2708.96
not even an apparition in euclidean

2706.72 --> 2711.2
space

2708.96 --> 2714.2
they only exist holographically to

2711.2 --> 2714.2
observers

2719.119 --> 2722.119
ugh

2736.319 --> 2739.92
wow

2737.68 --> 2742.96
it's such beautiful weather outside this

2739.92 --> 2742.96
is really incredible

2743.839 --> 2748.839
can hear the birds can you guys hear

2745.839 --> 2748.839
that

2772.72 --> 2780.2799999999997
yeah seeking star hello by the way

2775.44 --> 2780.28
akumu just said he was gonna watch it

2792.8 --> 2798.76
yeah it does feel like spring

2794.88 --> 2798.76
and it's five days early

2804.96 --> 2811.92
so just look just look it's amazing it's

2808.96 --> 2811.92
so beautiful

2812.24 --> 2815.24
just

2818.96 --> 2823.079
doesn't that just look amazing

2834.96 --> 2839.52
i don't know what it is

2836.72 --> 2841.839
it's just that the webcam it looks diff

2839.52 --> 2843.28
so different than when i see it with my

2841.839 --> 2844.72
eyes it's

2843.28 --> 2846.6400000000003
maybe i'm getting like all this

2844.72 --> 2848.9599999999996
holographic side effect from the

2846.64 --> 2852.16
sunlight because like that tree over

2848.96 --> 2856.079
there that i'm pointing at

2852.16 --> 2858.48
i see so much light play and contrast

2856.079 --> 2861.6800000000003
with shadow i see it so much it's really

2858.48 --> 2861.68
jumping towards me

2861.76 --> 2867.0400000000004
it's like

2863.92 --> 2869.76
all these little details

2867.04 --> 2872.48
and it is because of the sun

2869.76 --> 2874.6400000000003
like sunlight is really unique

2872.48 --> 2877.119
it's not the same as just

2874.64 --> 2879.04
man-made lamp light at all

2877.119 --> 2882.559
it is really really different when you

2879.04 --> 2882.5589999999997
pay attention carefully

2885.28 --> 2890.8
it's 37 degrees sheesh turret oh yeah

2889.04 --> 2894.319
you're in india right

2890.8 --> 2894.319
yeah it should be a bit warmer there

2895.76 --> 2901.8390000000004
that's like a hot summer's day here in

2897.599 --> 2901.839
the netherlands 37 degrees celsius

2904.72 --> 2908.0
yeah we rarely get that

2911.119 --> 2915.839
yeah temperature right here now is 13

2913.52 --> 2915.839
degrees

2916.0 --> 2920.28
right it feels warmer though

2931.28 --> 2934.6400000000003
yeah let's calm down a bit

2935.68 --> 2942.0
deli gets hot in march huh

2939.119 --> 2945.28
did my freaking camera freeze again what

2942.0 --> 2946.88
the [ __ ] is wrong with that thing

2945.28 --> 2947.8390000000004
like seriously there might be something

2946.88 --> 2950.7200000000003
broken

2947.839 --> 2953.52
this is not good

2950.72 --> 2953.52
i may need to

2953.61 --> 2957.839
[Music]

2955.2 --> 2958.8799999999997
get a new one

2957.839 --> 2961.2799999999997
hey

2958.88 --> 2961.28
what the

2961.38 --> 2967.2400000000002
[Music]

2963.76 --> 2967.2400000000002
what the hell

2971.119 --> 2975.28
wow

2972.319 --> 2975.2799999999997
that was weird

2975.99 --> 2978.7999999999997
[Music]

2977.92 --> 2982.4
dude

2978.8 --> 2985.119
dude what the [ __ ] is going on

2982.4 --> 2987.34
stop [ __ ] doing that you piece of

2985.119 --> 2991.28
[ __ ] cam

2987.34 --> 2992.4
[Music]

2991.28 --> 2996.599
stop

2992.4 --> 2996.599
[ __ ] doing that

3004.72 --> 3007.72
ugh

3013.839 --> 3018.4
great i love it when everything

3016.4 --> 3020.7200000000003
everything around me in the middle of

3018.4 --> 3023.44
poverty when everything breaks down

3020.72 --> 3025.2799999999997
isn't it just lovely freaking computer

3023.44 --> 3027.28
breaking down monitor breaking down

3025.28 --> 3029.76
washing machine breaking down yeah

3027.28 --> 3033.44
microphone starting to break down webcam

3029.76 --> 3036.559
starting to break down what's next

3033.44 --> 3039.119
my sound system is giving weird errors

3036.559 --> 3041.52
already like like oh man but just

3039.119 --> 3044.4
everything why not just everything why

3041.52 --> 3046.88
not just literally get cracks in the

3044.4 --> 3048.7200000000003
building right there on my balcony or

3046.88 --> 3049.599
something why doesn't that just break

3048.72 --> 3050.7999999999997
down

3049.599 --> 3054.7200000000003
yeah

3050.8 --> 3056.48
why doesn't the the geyser

3054.72 --> 3058.7999999999997
the water system why doesn't it just

3056.48 --> 3061.599
break down come on let's let it all

3058.8 --> 3064.0
break down just all at once and then

3061.599 --> 3066.319
maybe just throw a big [ __ ] bomb

3064.0 --> 3069.319
after it

3066.319 --> 3069.319
jesus

3078.319 --> 3083.64
no it's not hackers jeff gassett that's

3080.64 --> 3083.64
ridiculous

3106.8 --> 3110.599
hello delta spirit

3112.88 --> 3115.96
all right

3125.72 --> 3132.72
astronomical winter and meteorological

3129.52 --> 3132.72
what what does that mean

3133.119 --> 3136.48
what is that what is an astronomical

3135.2 --> 3139.839
winter

3136.48 --> 3139.839
what does that mean

3141.68 --> 3146.0789999999997
what does astronomy have to do with that

3146.319 --> 3150.119
or am i whatever

3154.8 --> 3159.6800000000003
north of the equator

3156.559 --> 3159.6800000000003
it's the best way to say it

3168.96 --> 3171.359
okay

3171.72 --> 3177.8799999999997
astronomical winter i still don't know

3174.079 --> 3177.88
what that means though

3187.119 --> 3189.599
really

3191.48 --> 3198.079
meteorological winter is different than

3194.8 --> 3200.4
the astronomical winter

3198.079 --> 3200.4
what

3201.2 --> 3205.68
why

3202.8 --> 3205.6800000000003
that's weird

3206.88 --> 3211.2400000000002
is that it's always been like that

3229.76 --> 3232.76
hmm

3243.52 --> 3248.4
astronomical guided by the habit right

3245.68 --> 3251.1189999999997
it's based on the algo the rhythm

3248.4 --> 3251.839
of the celestials

3251.119 --> 3254.1600000000003
but

3251.839 --> 3256.96
yeah astronomically like this the

3254.16 --> 3259.92
celestials do actually change right they

3256.96 --> 3261.04
change with the season like the suns are

3259.92 --> 3263.52
different

3261.04 --> 3266.0
they don't have the same light output in

3263.52 --> 3267.599
the different seasons

3266.0 --> 3270.88
and that is

3267.599 --> 3273.3590000000004
in my view in my research why

3270.88 --> 3275.6800000000003
basically the seasons are influenced so

3273.359 --> 3278.48
much because the celestial output is

3275.68 --> 3280.96
literally changing over the seasons but

3278.48 --> 3284.72
then to hear that

3280.96 --> 3287.2
the actual meteorological response

3284.72 --> 3287.2
kind of

3287.68 --> 3290.3999999999996
as it

3289.04 --> 3292.64
follows up

3290.4 --> 3294.1600000000003
the astronomical changes

3292.64 --> 3296.24
that's kind of weird i thought that it

3294.16 --> 3298.24
would be pretty much

3296.24 --> 3300.8799999999997
lockstep

3298.24 --> 3304.2799999999997
the same but apparently not

3300.88 --> 3304.28
that's weird

3316.559 --> 3320.0400000000004
oh bad

3327.119 --> 3332.4
yeah by the way my jaw

3329.28 --> 3332.4
is doing pretty good

3332.48 --> 3335.839
it's at

3337.359 --> 3341.2799999999997
what was it yesterday was 25 right it's

3340.079 --> 3343.76
about

3341.28 --> 3346.079
or was it already 10 it i feel it's like

3343.76 --> 3346.079
10

3346.96 --> 3352.319
didn't have to rough a night with it

3350.24 --> 3354.3999999999996
but it's still kind of sensitive and

3352.319 --> 3357.359
it's weird because every time i get like

3354.4 --> 3358.88
wounded in my gums somewhere for some

3357.359 --> 3361.2799999999997
reason

3358.88 --> 3363.04
and it's like bad like bleeding

3361.28 --> 3366.0
and then it really needs to heal then

3363.04 --> 3369.44
like everything starts to hurt

3366.0 --> 3372.72
it's like one part of my gums just that

3369.44 --> 3374.559
it regenerating triggers everything

3372.72 --> 3376.319
and then it all becomes kind of painful

3374.559 --> 3378.88
and that's what had been it's been

3376.319 --> 3381.7599999999998
nagging me in the last week

3378.88 --> 3384.0
or in the last half week

3381.76 --> 3386.3190000000004
but it's almost completely

3384.0 --> 3388.72
healed up now i'm very happy and i hope

3386.319 --> 3391.839
it's just not gonna happen again

3388.72 --> 3391.839
because that did suck

3392.4 --> 3396.559
nice chair in the background yeah

3394.799 --> 3399.839
dude that chair's been

3396.559 --> 3404.3190000000004
literally in every early bird show and

3399.839 --> 3405.2799999999997
every flat earth talks show ever

3404.319 --> 3408.24
yeah

3405.28 --> 3408.2400000000002
it's an awesome chair

3410.88 --> 3416.2000000000003
it cost me like 50 bucks in the second

3412.88 --> 3416.2000000000003
hand store

3420.24 --> 3425.1189999999997
i got a

3421.359 --> 3429.799
a couch like that too by the way

3425.119 --> 3429.799
but it's in storage it doesn't fit here

3433.04 --> 3437.96
i kind of miss that couch it's really

3434.96 --> 3437.96
awesome

3448.559 --> 3452.3190000000004
but yeah i really like that chair

3454.559 --> 3457.52
let me show you

3458.799 --> 3463.52
this

3460.079 --> 3463.52
screw me over this time

3464.079 --> 3466.4
right

3467.28 --> 3470.52
so yeah

3475.839 --> 3482.0
it's kind of a chair for a big person

3478.16 --> 3485.04
the chair is actually too big for me

3482.0 --> 3486.839
but i just really like it

3485.04 --> 3489.359
kind of use it like a

3486.839 --> 3493.2799999999997
throne and like if i'm gonna watch a

3489.359 --> 3493.2799999999997
movie i'm gonna sit in that chair

3496.16 --> 3501.1189999999997
and then it's really cute just sit back

3498.48 --> 3501.119
and just like

3504.4 --> 3508.319
it looks damn comfortable yeah it's

3506.16 --> 3511.359
pretty cool

3508.319 --> 3514.24
they're like 150 200 jesus

3511.359 --> 3517.2799999999997
that's extremely expensive len linux no

3514.24 --> 3520.4799999999996
i bought it for 50 euros

3517.28 --> 3520.48
around 10 years ago

3520.88 --> 3525.359
second hand

3522.4 --> 3527.44
right in like a typical second-hand

3525.359 --> 3529.359
store and everything is kind of cheap

3527.44 --> 3531.52
there

3529.359 --> 3534.319
so yeah it was that it was a bargain at

3531.52 --> 3534.319
the time i guess

3535.2 --> 3540.5989999999997
dresses swivel and tilt what

3561.44 --> 3564.44
uh

3578.4 --> 3581.6800000000003
like a computer chair

3581.92 --> 3585.839
okay

3583.92 --> 3590.079
well i don't use it as a computer chair

3585.839 --> 3590.0789999999997
because that's really uncomfortable like

3590.16 --> 3594.3999999999996
yeah you have to kind of lean backwards

3592.64 --> 3596.5589999999997
to even sit on it

3594.4 --> 3600.2400000000002
that's not handy when you're kind of

3596.559 --> 3601.92
trying to operate a computer

3600.24 --> 3604.0789999999997
like maybe if you're gaming with a

3601.92 --> 3608.599
controller it would be doable but still

3604.079 --> 3608.599
i i don't recommend it

3618.64 --> 3622.96
you ever thought doing flat earth

3620.96 --> 3625.52
interviews

3622.96 --> 3625.52
i could

3625.68 --> 3630.0
sure

3628.0 --> 3632.16
why not

3630.0 --> 3635.44
akumavir i've technically always been

3632.16 --> 3638.16
open to that interviews about flat earth

3635.44 --> 3642.079
except with anti-flat earthers because

3638.16 --> 3644.8799999999997
then it's going to cost you

3642.079 --> 3648.2400000000002
let's just say starting price 500 euros

3644.88 --> 3650.4
yeah i'm gonna cut yeah undercut my

3648.24 --> 3653.2
colleagues price which is like they're

3650.4 --> 3655.359
like 4 000 euros all that i'll do it for

3653.2 --> 3657.9199999999996
500 yeah

3655.359 --> 3660.72
so yeah anti-flat earth has always won

3657.92 --> 3662.799
me on oh they want a little bit of rage

3660.72 --> 3666.24
win so they can feel so

3662.799 --> 3668.88
emotionally stable compared to me yeah

3666.24 --> 3672.0
go [ __ ] yourself i'm not going on your

3668.88 --> 3675.04
[ __ ] scored boy shows you delusional

3672.0 --> 3678.799
double speaking freaks

3675.04 --> 3682.079
but if there's just a person in radio or

3678.799 --> 3684.72
whatever online and they wanna

3682.079 --> 3687.04
they want to pick my brain about my flat

3684.72 --> 3690.0
earth knowledge and mechanics and like

3687.04 --> 3692.16
the celestial light so how my ideas yeah

3690.0 --> 3696.4
sure i'll talk about that i've always

3692.16 --> 3696.3999999999996
been open to that yeah always

3697.2 --> 3703.2799999999997
always

3698.64 --> 3703.2799999999997
it's just that i'm too weird i think

3704.079 --> 3708.48
i'm like

3705.599 --> 3711.04
a bit dangerous and unpredictable and

3708.48 --> 3713.839
people just can't handle that because

3711.04 --> 3714.96
everybody in the world is a [ __ ]

3713.839 --> 3717.0389999999998
wussy

3714.96 --> 3720.2400000000002
they're all wussies

3717.039 --> 3721.599
nobody can handle me

3720.24 --> 3723.839
they're scared

3721.599 --> 3726.2400000000002
like yeah but what if arwen says

3723.839 --> 3728.0789999999997
something really unexpectedly brilliant

3726.24 --> 3730.72
that's completely out of place and very

3728.079 --> 3732.319
inconvenient yeah that's what i [ __ ]

3730.72 --> 3734.48
do

3732.319 --> 3735.599
why don't you [ __ ] deal with it

3734.48 --> 3738.079
yeah

3735.599 --> 3740.6400000000003
instead of oh we only gotta get people

3738.079 --> 3742.559
that are so predictable that nothing

3740.64 --> 3744.96
unexpected

3742.559 --> 3746.7200000000003
yeah or you could just have something

3744.96 --> 3750.0
interesting

3746.72 --> 3752.24
instead of always being the boring same

3750.0 --> 3754.48
tagline [ __ ]

3752.24 --> 3756.3999999999996
like everybody else out there

3754.48 --> 3759.839
yeah you could have me on

3756.4 --> 3762.0
and then unpredictable [ __ ] will happen

3759.839 --> 3764.64
and you're gonna like it

3762.0 --> 3766.799
and you're gonna be like why the [ __ ]

3764.64 --> 3770.48
did i ever think that it wasn't a good

3766.799 --> 3770.48
idea to have r went on yeah

3773.44 --> 3779.599
right i i don't see nathan having

3776.16 --> 3782.48
regrets of having me on the panel

3779.599 --> 3784.88
except when i'm like

3782.48 --> 3788.319
nagging him too much with baldwin that's

3784.88 --> 3790.319
when he's not in the mood for it

3788.319 --> 3792.96
right

3790.319 --> 3794.64
i don't know man i am open for that [ __ ]

3792.96 --> 3796.88
as long as just not in the middle of the

3794.64 --> 3798.4
night for me then it's great i don't

3796.88 --> 3800.2400000000002
want to do [ __ ] in the middle of the

3798.4 --> 3802.799
night

3800.24 --> 3802.799
that's all

3802.96 --> 3807.44
so yeah if americans want me on it's

3805.52 --> 3811.48
going to have to be very early for them

3807.44 --> 3811.48
or it's not going to work for me

3811.97 --> 3815.08
[Music]

3819.37 --> 3822.449
[Music]

3833.599 --> 3839.839
hey gary benga

3835.76 --> 3839.8390000000004
it's been a while to see you

3852.799 --> 3858.2
it would bring their viewers

3855.2 --> 3858.2
maybe

3879.68 --> 3885.2
on the other hand it's just that

3882.72 --> 3888.319
most of the like the j tolerance crowd

3885.2 --> 3891.2
and all that and even dell

3888.319 --> 3893.68
those people already know me

3891.2 --> 3895.839
and they know me through fed right all

3893.68 --> 3898.0
those people most people

3895.839 --> 3900.4
are kind of connected through flat earth

3898.0 --> 3900.4
debate

3901.119 --> 3906.4
because nathan's been very good at

3903.359 --> 3908.72
basically like making a community that

3906.4 --> 3911.039
word he loves so much community right

3908.72 --> 3913.68
flat earth community but it is he's been

3911.039 --> 3916.96
very effective in just tying in a whole

3913.68 --> 3918.5589999999997
bunch of people together

3916.96 --> 3920.64
so i don't know

3918.559 --> 3922.4
i don't know if it's really gonna get me

3920.64 --> 3926.0
like a lot of new viewers because i

3922.4 --> 3929.52
think that people like j told media

3926.0 --> 3929.52
those people already know me

3930.799 --> 3936.4
you know i've been at it longer than

3933.2 --> 3940.0
most flat earthers out there

3936.4 --> 3945.319
i've been at it since 2016.

3940.0 --> 3945.319
most people kind of came in at 2017.

3957.28 --> 3961.92
it's nice to see the same people in chat

3959.52 --> 3965.839
over at fvd yeah sure

3961.92 --> 3965.839
a lot of new people get into

3967.359 --> 3972.24
ah yeah good servant hello

3970.079 --> 3975.2000000000003
yeah you had me on your show

3972.24 --> 3978.5589999999997
yeah but that also works because we had

3975.2 --> 3980.72
a thing that we could talk about

3978.559 --> 3983.28
right we had like a

3980.72 --> 3984.319
look yeah i guess it's now a big cool

3983.28 --> 3986.3190000000004
off but

3984.319 --> 3988.88
we had a connection

3986.319 --> 3991.119
so there was just a lot to talk about

3988.88 --> 3994.6400000000003
right

3991.119 --> 3994.6400000000003
hello cana bear how are you doing

3996.0 --> 4000.319
how was the the yeah the cat funeral

4002.799 --> 4006.68
i hope it was nice

4011.839 --> 4015.359
i think irwin would be a great yes i am

4013.92 --> 4018.079
a great guest

4015.359 --> 4020.4
because if i'm a guest then i really

4018.079 --> 4021.599
know how to compose myself

4020.4 --> 4025.28
yeah

4021.599 --> 4025.28
if i have to be an interviewer

4026.0 --> 4029.72
i

4027.359 --> 4031.52
i wouldn't know what to do

4029.72 --> 4034.72
[Laughter]

4031.52 --> 4035.68
i am not an interviewer

4034.72 --> 4037.2799999999997
right

4035.68 --> 4039.7599999999998
like i'm

4037.28 --> 4041.3590000000004
i'd be worse than alex jones

4039.76 --> 4043.599
that's kind of a joke by the way saying

4041.359 --> 4045.68
that he has interviewed people why

4043.599 --> 4048.6400000000003
because every time alex jones interviews

4045.68 --> 4052.0
people he always starts rumpusing them

4048.64 --> 4055.7599999999998
always talking like oh oh you you said

4052.0 --> 4058.079
like five words oh let me pile 50 words

4055.76 --> 4061.3590000000004
on top of that that kinda relate and he

4058.079 --> 4063.3590000000004
does it every freaking sentence yeah

4061.359 --> 4066.0789999999997
i would have that tendency i don't think

4063.359 --> 4068.64
i'd make a great interview

4066.079 --> 4071.52
but i'm good at getting interviewed

4068.64 --> 4073.7599999999998
right i thought that like patricia steer

4071.52 --> 4076.4
interviewed me i uploaded that

4073.76 --> 4077.28
on my show when it happened i mean on my

4076.4 --> 4080.96
channel

4077.28 --> 4080.96
that was great because it works

4081.039 --> 4084.88
i i know how to be interviewed

4085.28 --> 4091.6400000000003
i'm good at that i'm not good at

4087.119 --> 4091.6400000000003
interviewing other people at all

4093.599 --> 4098.719
yeah i know akuma virus alex jones yeah

4096.0 --> 4100.48
it's funny it is funny it's hilarious to

4098.719 --> 4103.359
see that and it's super annoying because

4100.48 --> 4105.599999999999
he rhombuses

4103.359 --> 4108.56
like really bad and then like he

4105.6 --> 4110.069
rhompuses and nobody can say anything

4108.56 --> 4113.04
about it

4110.069 --> 4115.04
[Laughter]

4113.04 --> 4116.719
and then eventually he starts saying

4115.04 --> 4119.839
something about but just when it happens

4116.719 --> 4122.799
he can't stop himself he just can't stop

4119.839 --> 4124.88
it he has to rump us

4122.799 --> 4127.759
oh you said five word oh i have to say

4124.88 --> 4129.839
my 50 words now like i have to in the

4127.759 --> 4131.44
middle of your sentence

4129.839 --> 4133.199
and then in the next minute he'll do it

4131.44 --> 4137.199
again and then the minute after he'll do

4133.199 --> 4137.199
it again he can't help himself

4139.279 --> 4144.64
does anybody miss rumpus's smug lying

4141.199 --> 4146.639999999999
voice on fed yeah i do

4144.64 --> 4148.400000000001
although i don't think

4146.64 --> 4150.719
i think a bit of the rumpus magic is

4148.4 --> 4153.12
probably gone he's become too

4150.719 --> 4154.56
too much like brenda

4153.12 --> 4157.3589999999995
it's just

4154.56 --> 4161.359
too offensive now right it's not funny

4157.359 --> 4166.159000000001
anymore i thought he was so funny always

4161.359 --> 4169.679
but he's he would just be a freaking nag

4166.159 --> 4171.04
just annoying kind of like brenda

4169.679 --> 4172.96
so it probably wouldn't even work

4171.04 --> 4175.839
anymore even if nathan allowed him back

4172.96 --> 4175.839
on

4176.88 --> 4179.1990000000005
what

hope you get your paypal working again

4365.44 --> 4371.159
and the flat earther has similar cannons

4367.52 --> 4371.159000000001
oh that's creepy

4373.679 --> 4378.159
well canada bear

4375.52 --> 4379.6
we're still talking about rv right

4378.159 --> 4381.879999999999
well

4379.6 --> 4383.6
rv is an

4381.88 --> 4385.6
extremely

4383.6 --> 4388.4800000000005
extremely

4385.6 --> 4390.56
suspicious character okay he's never

4388.48 --> 4392.0
been on camera

4390.56 --> 4394.320000000001
never

4392.0 --> 4394.32
why

4394.88 --> 4399.84
well why hasn't rumpus ever been on

4397.52 --> 4402.0
camera right we don't even know if that

4399.84 --> 4404.2390000000005
one picture we associate with him

4402.0 --> 4408.4
actually is him

4404.239 --> 4410.639999999999
could be but we don't know yeah rv truth

4408.4 --> 4412.4
is kind of similar that's because he

4410.64 --> 4415.52
might absolutely

4412.4 --> 4418.159
there's a big big chance that rv

4415.52 --> 4420.96
is actually a controlled opposition

4418.159 --> 4422.96
infiltrate who's actually a baller

4420.96 --> 4425.36
probably a jesuit

4422.96 --> 4426.56
and there to destroy the flat earth

4425.36 --> 4428.48
community

4426.56 --> 4430.4800000000005
guess what he's been doing

4428.48 --> 4433.28
guess what he's been doing sowing

4430.48 --> 4435.759999999999
paranoia creating safonia's syndrome

4433.28 --> 4439.04
attacking other flat earthers not

4435.76 --> 4441.12
getting into mechanical details

4439.04 --> 4444.239
yeah that's exactly what you would

4441.12 --> 4446.96
expect of an infiltrant jesuit who is

4444.239 --> 4449.839999999999
there to specifically derail and destroy

4446.96 --> 4451.92
the flat earth community yeah

4449.84 --> 4455.84
because i think that's what he is

4451.92 --> 4455.84
been thinking that for a while

4463.04 --> 4466.64
did jake i don't give a [ __ ]

4465.28 --> 4468.88
about jake

4466.64 --> 4473.12
i don't know why people even remember

4468.88 --> 4473.12
him who gives a [ __ ] about jake

4473.36 --> 4478.159
who cares if he did some [ __ ] hit

4475.6 --> 4479.679
piece on some [ __ ] out there nobody

4478.159 --> 4483.04
gives a [ __ ]

4479.679 --> 4487.1990000000005
the guy is completely unreliable for

4483.04 --> 4487.199
your for opinions about anything

4488.08 --> 4491.76
like jake is not a go-to guy

4490.88 --> 4495.1990000000005
to

4491.76 --> 4498.320000000001
learn about other people okay

4495.199 --> 4501.678999999999
he's insane

4498.32 --> 4503.28
he's insane he's a hard drug addict and

4501.679 --> 4508.08
repenting

4503.28 --> 4509.44
and he is violently anti-social

4508.08 --> 4512.239
yeah

4509.44 --> 4514.799999999999
i don't even know why you'd care if he

4512.239 --> 4517.199
did some hit piece on anybody like why

4514.8 --> 4518.08
would anybody care what jake freaking

4517.199 --> 4521.08
does

4518.08 --> 4521.08
ever

4530.4 --> 4536.92
do you want to see a good expose on jake

4533.12 --> 4536.92
or i mean on rv

4538.64 --> 4544.719
then

4540.32 --> 4544.719
i suggest you check out jaren

4544.8 --> 4549.84
right

4545.6 --> 4552.2390000000005
i i trust jaren on expose about people a

4549.84 --> 4556.08
lot more than anybody else out there

4552.239 --> 4557.36
because he's actually takes great care

4556.08 --> 4559.679
to do it

4557.36 --> 4563.28
correctly

4559.679 --> 4567.32
and not exaggerate not hype [ __ ] up not

4563.28 --> 4567.32
pile on a bunch of crap

4576.159 --> 4582.879999999999
hey getting sick it's been a while

4580.239 --> 4582.879999999999
good to see you

4589.199 --> 4593.678999999999
if jaren didn't do videos and yeah

4591.52 --> 4596.64
that's yeah that's an issue though

4593.679 --> 4598.08
but jake was really going after jaron so

4596.64 --> 4600.8
i think jeremy was mostly doing it

4598.08 --> 4604.4
self-defense but it was

4600.8 --> 4604.400000000001
it was unnecessary though

4607.679 --> 4612.0
like

4608.64 --> 4613.6
he did go a bit over the top with jake

4612.0 --> 4615.679
it would have been better if he kept it

4613.6 --> 4616.4800000000005
shorter and less

4615.679 --> 4620.08
less

4616.48 --> 4622.879999999999
emotional infused emotionally infused

4620.08 --> 4625.12
but yeah it happened

4622.88 --> 4627.52
but yeah i trust jaren a lot more with

4625.12 --> 4628.96
opinions about other people than i do

4627.52 --> 4631.4400000000005
freaking jake

4628.96 --> 4634.8
ugh

4631.44 --> 4634.799999999999
[Music]

4647.12 --> 4651.36
what

4649.44 --> 4655.44
you hear about jake on

4651.36 --> 4655.44
infinite plane radio what

4657.199 --> 4661.879999999999
i don't know what that is but okay

4677.52 --> 4682.400000000001
because oh borders which it you've seen

4680.4 --> 4685.28
with it in person

4682.4 --> 4688.48
yeah that's which it gets it

4685.28 --> 4691.28
that guy's pretty interesting

4688.48 --> 4695.04
but he is kind of part of the

4691.28 --> 4695.04
the no dell empire so

4695.199 --> 4699.44
well yeah which gets it he's been on fed

4697.6 --> 4702.320000000001
even

4699.44 --> 4704.639999999999
and he is like a really

4702.32 --> 4706.639999999999
laid back guy that's like not afraid to

4704.64 --> 4708.88
basically face people and [ __ ] he's

4706.64 --> 4711.4400000000005
pretty cool

4708.88 --> 4712.4800000000005
and he's pretty well spoken to his good

4711.44 --> 4714.799999999999
fluid

4712.48 --> 4717.678999999999
verbal skills i mean i don't think he's

4714.8 --> 4721.0
like a real genuine genius but he is

4717.679 --> 4721.0
pretty cool

4722.64 --> 4725.84
and he is kind of smart

4726.48 --> 4729.839999999999
smart enough

4727.92 --> 4731.28
smart enough to deal with ballers at

4729.84 --> 4735.8
least

4731.28 --> 4735.8
right yeah i know wits it

4773.36 --> 4777.92
who would follow that jake though well

4775.44 --> 4779.44
you'd be surprised canada barrett

4777.92 --> 4781.12
i think that jake does have more

4779.44 --> 4784.159
followers than we even want to realize

4781.12 --> 4786.8
and they're mostly like really

4784.159 --> 4787.679
well other [ __ ] people that are just

4786.8 --> 4790.320000000001
like

4787.679 --> 4792.719
like teens that are just like oh [ __ ]

4790.32 --> 4793.679
everybody right i don't want to give a

4792.719 --> 4795.28
[ __ ]

4793.679 --> 4797.04
and there's people like that so he

4795.28 --> 4798.4
probably has a whole bunch of teenagers

4797.04 --> 4800.32
that kind of follow him because he's

4798.4 --> 4802.48
like oh look at that guy that guy gives

4800.32 --> 4804.88
him [ __ ] he's cool

4802.48 --> 4807.759999999999
yeah there's people like that out there

4804.88 --> 4807.76
unfortunately

4807.92 --> 4812.4
right so yeah those people are probably

4810.56 --> 4814.4800000000005
the ones following him

4812.4 --> 4816.32
because i don't know

4814.48 --> 4819.839999999999
who in their right mind would give a

4816.32 --> 4819.84
[ __ ] about that guy

4823.12 --> 4828.48
then again some people might say that

4825.679 --> 4829.4400000000005
about me as well but

4828.48 --> 4831.839999999999
right

4829.44 --> 4834.32
just because i'm a little extreme a

4831.84 --> 4837.360000000001
little eccentric

4834.32 --> 4840.08
doesn't necessarily mean that i'm not

4837.36 --> 4840.08
sympathetic

4840.8 --> 4844.92
can't say the same for jake

4857.44 --> 4862.48
yeah i doubt the spirit

4859.52 --> 4864.56
yeah wits it's fluid he can talk about

4862.48 --> 4867.36
anything and he doesn't always bring

4864.56 --> 4869.76
like like the most solid up-to-date

4867.36 --> 4871.92
arguments but he is

4869.76 --> 4874.159000000001
like good enough

4871.92 --> 4877.28
like he will be informative to people

4874.159 --> 4878.08
that are completely oblivious to it all

4877.28 --> 4880.88
right

4878.08 --> 4883.92
and he is like not he's not

4880.88 --> 4886.08
the shy type so he just just bump into a

4883.92 --> 4889.84
group and just starts talking and [ __ ]

4886.08 --> 4889.84
like i wouldn't really do that

4890.639 --> 4895.96
i mean you'd have to literally come to

4892.56 --> 4895.96
me and ask

4904.639 --> 4908.32
he can talk on any subject

4906.96 --> 4910.56
like me

4908.32 --> 4910.5599999999995
huh

4912.88 --> 4918.719
i can talk about more though than him

4915.76 --> 4918.719
in more detail

4920.56 --> 4924.159000000001
yeah but how do you test that you know

4922.239 --> 4926.159
well you could test that you could have

4924.159 --> 4929.5199999999995
us both like in a competition and then

4926.159 --> 4931.5199999999995
like act just ask

4929.52 --> 4934.159000000001
things all over the place and just see

4931.52 --> 4936.88
what we could respond with

4934.159 --> 4939.599999999999
i think i'd probably do better unless it

4936.88 --> 4941.92
was like intricate american history or

4939.6 --> 4944.159000000001
something and then yeah of course

4941.92 --> 4948.08
i'm not gonna win that although i'd

4944.159 --> 4948.08
still get a whole bunch of it right

4950.719 --> 4956.88
does putin blow believe in fled who

4954.08 --> 4956.88
gives a [ __ ]

4957.12 --> 4960.4
who gives a [ __ ]

4964.56 --> 4971.1990000000005
that's ridic like

4967.199 --> 4971.199
what the [ __ ] is that for [ __ ]

4971.44 --> 4975.599999999999
yeah

4973.12 --> 4978.08
i don't think putin has any problem with

4975.6 --> 4980.159000000001
people having any ideas as long as they

4978.08 --> 4984.239
don't act

4980.159 --> 4984.239
to damage or hurt others

4984.88 --> 4989.36
yeah

4987.04 --> 4992.08
you can believe whatever the [ __ ] you

4989.36 --> 4995.5199999999995
want as long as you don't like

4992.08 --> 4996.96
start to damage the economy or

4995.52 --> 4999.280000000001
like

4996.96 --> 5001.6
make a whole bunch of people restless

4999.28 --> 5004.4
like cults do like for example he

5001.6 --> 5004.400000000001
cracked down on

5004.639 --> 5007.04
what is it

5007.84 --> 5011.679
the evangelical group

5012.639 --> 5016.400000000001
right

5013.52 --> 5018.4800000000005
but that's not because of their belief

5016.4 --> 5020.638999999999
is because of what they do so yeah if

5018.48 --> 5023.5199999999995
there were flat earth

5020.639 --> 5026.639
activists and they were like really

5023.52 --> 5028.8
being super aggressive and like leftist

5026.639 --> 5030.0
like yeah he's gonna [ __ ] crack down

5028.8 --> 5032.56
on that what do you think is gonna

5030.0 --> 5034.0
happen right they have they have a

5032.56 --> 5037.6
russian

5034.0 --> 5040.159
investment they have the space station

5037.6 --> 5043.1990000000005
he's not gonna like it if you're gonna

5040.159 --> 5045.92
[ __ ] all over that but he's not like oh

5043.199 --> 5048.96
you're not allowed to believe it we're

5045.92 --> 5050.719
gonna erase all flat earth imagery from

5048.96 --> 5054.0
the internet no way

5050.719 --> 5056.56
it's just gonna like like okay you wanna

5054.0 --> 5060.639
dig into that do it over there and leave

5056.56 --> 5060.639
us alone that's what putin would do

5060.719 --> 5065.36
yeah

5062.48 --> 5065.36
it's ridiculous

5067.679 --> 5073.6
that putin doesn't do that you don't

5069.76 --> 5076.8
know what the [ __ ] you're talking about

5073.6 --> 5080.56

5082.639 --> 5088.719
obsessed freaks that projects

when he doesn't actually do that

5093.679 --> 5097.52

freak

5097.52 --> 5102.56
leftist numpty freak projecting a bit

5100.32 --> 5102.5599999999995

5104.239 --> 5109.678999999999
putin sends gays to the gulag yeah

5107.04 --> 5109.679
that's right

5110.239 --> 5114.239
that's right

5111.6 --> 5116.8

5130.32 --> 5134.5199999999995
maybe he does maybe he doesn't

5141.92 --> 5147.6
yeah but yeah i'm okay i'm okay with

5145.12 --> 5150.239
most things that he's done

5147.6 --> 5151.360000000001
including sending gays to the gulag yeah

5150.239 --> 5154.32
because

5151.36 --> 5156.4
just because you happen to be homosexual

5156.4 --> 5162.879999999999

5162.88 --> 5167.679
oh everybody can be gay oh your kid

5166.0 --> 5169.84
should be gay yeah that's when he's

5167.679 --> 5173.84
gonna [ __ ] arrest you and throw you

5169.84 --> 5176.159000000001

5176.159 --> 5183.5199999999995
yeah i totally back those actions i am

5179.6 --> 5186.96
all for that yeah because gay is not

5183.52 --> 5189.360000000001
something you should freaking celebrate

5186.96 --> 5190.2390000000005
like a demon

5189.36 --> 5192.5599999999995
yeah

5190.239 --> 5194.48
keep it to your [ __ ] self

5192.56 --> 5196.400000000001
be happy that you're not gonna be

5194.48 --> 5198.4
executed for it like in some other

5196.4 --> 5200.32
countries [ __ ]

5198.4 --> 5203.32
you disgusting

5200.32 --> 5203.32
freak

5222.639 --> 5228.2390000000005
yeah i have a very clear stance on gays

5225.6 --> 5230.96
i'm homophobic and i give a [ __ ] i'm

5228.239 --> 5232.159
super unapologetic about it

5230.96 --> 5235.44
right

5232.159 --> 5237.199
but just because you think you're gay

5235.44 --> 5238.879999999999
doesn't mean that you deserve to be

5237.199 --> 5241.36
killed or something

5238.88 --> 5244.159000000001
just means like keep it to your [ __ ]

5241.36 --> 5247.28
self and leave the damn kids alone

5244.159 --> 5250.0
yeah no parades no [ __ ] rainbow flags

5247.28 --> 5252.0
[ __ ] off with that garbage yeah you do

5250.0 --> 5254.88
that in your little secret squirt

5252.0 --> 5257.199
basement yeah that nobody should know

5254.88 --> 5258.8
about

5257.199 --> 5261.04
yeah and then it's all right you could

5258.8 --> 5263.6
do whatever the [ __ ] you want in secret

5261.04 --> 5265.92
and that's all great yeah

5263.6 --> 5268.88
just don't [ __ ] parade around with

5265.92 --> 5274.0
this garbage and don't seduce

5268.88 --> 5277.4800000000005
kids and don't nag christians yeah

5274.0 --> 5277.48
it's that simple

5294.96 --> 5299.199
get the [ __ ] out of here you push your

5296.8 --> 5299.1990000000005
scum

5302.32 --> 5306.799999999999
hello youtube

5304.08 --> 5309.28
why are you taking [ __ ] 10 seconds

5306.8 --> 5311.52
before you actually initiate the ban

5309.28 --> 5316.12
when i clicked it why does it take

5311.52 --> 5316.120000000001
[ __ ] 10 seconds you two

5327.52 --> 5330.559
[Music]

5338.88 --> 5341.6
yeah i know

5343.28 --> 5350.48
it's the latency not youtube really

5347.44 --> 5351.678999999999
the latency so then why if i type

5350.48 --> 5353.36
something

5351.679 --> 5356.719
like this

5353.36 --> 5358.719
enter there it is instantly instantly

5356.719 --> 5361.52
instantly yeah

5358.719 --> 5364.32
it's not even a tenth of a second wait

5361.52 --> 5366.8
yeah so when when i type something and i

5364.32 --> 5369.12
enter and it's there instantly then why

5366.8 --> 5370.400000000001
does it take [ __ ] 10

5369.12 --> 5373.599999999999
seconds

5370.4 --> 5377.36
before an action of

5373.6 --> 5380.2390000000005
hide user from channel click why does it

5377.36 --> 5382.0
take 10 seconds before it's actually

5380.239 --> 5384.4
removed and it's done

5382.0 --> 5386.4
that makes no sense has nothing to do

5384.4 --> 5388.48
with a connection

5386.4 --> 5391.04
it's stupid

5388.48 --> 5394.799999999999
if people do that while moderating it

5391.04 --> 5397.28
should happen instantly

5394.8 --> 5399.76
it should happen instantly not 10

5397.28 --> 5399.759999999999
seconds

5400.719 --> 5406.92
this is really bad

5403.52 --> 5406.92
bad system

5418.239 --> 5425.759999999999
four seconds oh really it appears later

5423.04 --> 5425.76
that sucks

5429.76 --> 5434.320000000001
are you sure because i think that the

5431.76 --> 5436.56
video has more delay than the chat

5434.32 --> 5438.4
seriously

5436.56 --> 5440.88
like if i type something

5438.4 --> 5442.799999999999
it's going to be in the chat and then if

5440.88 --> 5444.400000000001
i had the video i'm

5442.8 --> 5446.159000000001
not on mute

5444.4 --> 5447.44
then i'd hear myself talk about it

5446.159 --> 5451.28
afterward

5447.44 --> 5452.879999999999
the chat is faster than the video

5451.28 --> 5454.639
it just doesn't make any sense that

5452.88 --> 5457.679
there's such a delay when you actually

5454.639 --> 5461.56
moderate that's really bad

5457.679 --> 5461.56
should work a lot faster

5473.84 --> 5476.84
oh

5481.36 --> 5483.679
hmm

5486.159 --> 5488.4
okay

5489.44 --> 5493.04
right anyway it annoys me it annoys me

5491.679 --> 5495.4400000000005
that i'm like

5493.04 --> 5497.44
delete this delete this click

5495.44 --> 5499.5199999999995
and then it's just still there it just

5497.44 --> 5502.799999999999
still scrolls on the screen i'm like

5499.52 --> 5506.400000000001
dude just get it off immediately

5502.8 --> 5506.400000000001
why does it take so freaking long

5510.159 --> 5515.48
anyway

5511.36 --> 5515.48
yeah thanks for checking that

5518.08 --> 5526.08
it's free no it's not free

5521.52 --> 5528.400000000001
youtube is not free it's funded by ads

5526.08 --> 5532.36
it's not free

5528.4 --> 5532.36
youtube is not free

5534.0 --> 5537.92
the money has to come from somewhere

5538.08 --> 5544.239
yeah and my my channel is monetized that

5540.639 --> 5548.32
means i actually pay

5544.239 --> 5549.919999999999
for my bandwidth because i monetize yeah

5548.32 --> 5553.28
that money

5549.92 --> 5557.76
pays them so they can

5553.28 --> 5559.679
afford me to have around you understand

5557.76 --> 5562.8
do i pay for youtube

5559.679 --> 5562.8
yeah through ads

5562.96 --> 5568.719
that's right

5565.44 --> 5571.28
they get income from me

5568.719 --> 5571.28
that's right

5571.44 --> 5575.839999999999
they get all of it

5572.96 --> 5575.84
i don't care it's fine

5577.36 --> 5582.159
but it's not free

5580.08 --> 5584.0
i mean if it's free

5582.159 --> 5586.159
that's fine if you're then gonna fill it

5584.0 --> 5589.52
up you're gonna get

5586.159 --> 5591.28
squashed into a corner

5589.52 --> 5595.92
right unless there is something that

5591.28 --> 5595.92
they can get out of it like monetization

5596.239 --> 5603.5599999999995
and then it isn't like

5598.88 --> 5603.56
just a drain on the coffers anymore

5609.679 --> 5616.32
i think one thing five more pro yeah i

5612.48 --> 5618.5599999999995
know it's a big program you know it's

5616.32 --> 5621.04
yeah i'm not complaining about errors

5618.56 --> 5622.719
it's just that this particular one is

5621.04 --> 5625.36
really annoying

5622.719 --> 5627.04
especially if you have like spam if

5625.36 --> 5630.0
there's a lot of it

5627.04 --> 5633.28
then that delay is disastrous when a

5630.0 --> 5636.159
troll is removed it should be very quick

5633.28 --> 5638.639
it should be prioritized to have that

5636.159 --> 5640.48
removed

5638.639 --> 5641.52
like within the mechanism

5640.48 --> 5644.0
because

5641.52 --> 5646.2390000000005
them still being visible is the

5644.0 --> 5649.12
disruption that's the disruption

5646.239 --> 5651.44
specifically you want to have removed so

5649.12 --> 5652.4
there can't be a delay it should be very

5651.44 --> 5655.5199999999995
quick

5652.4 --> 5657.92
once a moderator actually ban somebody

5655.52 --> 5662.22
that should work very quickly should be

5657.92 --> 5664.32
given priority within the system

5662.22 --> 5665.84
[Music]

5664.32 --> 5668.84
in my opinion

5665.84 --> 5668.84
anyway

5697.199 --> 5700.199
so

5703.52 --> 5708.4800000000005
oh yeah borders boy yeah indeed but yeah

5706.239 --> 5711.119
the super chats and the ad revenue are

5708.48 --> 5712.959999999999
basically the same batch

5711.119 --> 5716.639
so if somebody gives me a super chat it

5712.96 --> 5717.6
basically ends up in the same jar

5716.639 --> 5720.400000000001
in which

5717.6 --> 5723.4400000000005
ad revenue comes and then eventually

5720.4 --> 5725.5199999999995
what i get from that i do get money from

5723.44 --> 5727.44
that but then yeah i have to report it

5725.52 --> 5729.4400000000005
to my government and then they take

5727.44 --> 5731.678999999999
everything out again so i don't really

5729.44 --> 5732.638999999999
make a profit from it

5731.679 --> 5734.639
right

5732.639 --> 5737.92
but at least

5734.639 --> 5739.52
youtube's not making a loss on me

5737.92 --> 5742.4800000000005
i find that

5739.52 --> 5744.159000000001
a reasonable position

5742.48 --> 5746.32
to have

5744.159 --> 5749.04
like that's reasonable yeah you

5746.32 --> 5752.32
shouldn't expect to be able to

5749.04 --> 5755.84
perpetually parasite on something

5752.32 --> 5756.88
just because technically it's free

5755.84 --> 5758.4800000000005
yeah

5756.88 --> 5759.84
i know there's people out there that

5758.48 --> 5762.08
think like that it's like oh it's free

5759.84 --> 5764.2390000000005
that means we can just loot it

5762.08 --> 5766.48
yeah i don't think like that i think

5764.239 --> 5768.638999999999
like hey this is a service

5766.48 --> 5771.5199999999995
they have a luxury position where they

5768.639 --> 5775.28
can actually offer something for free

5771.52 --> 5776.320000000001
let's not abuse it and let's not break

5775.28 --> 5778.8
that

5776.32 --> 5782.08
so let's make sure that they can

5778.8 --> 5783.1990000000005
actually keep going

5782.08 --> 5786.4
right

5783.199 --> 5790.4
by allowing ads so that you're not a

5786.4 --> 5792.879999999999
drain on them as a youtuber

5790.4 --> 5795.36
that's just reasonability right it's

5792.88 --> 5798.84
just taking some basic responsibility

5795.36 --> 5798.839999999999
for what you do

5800.4 --> 5804.4
especially if you have like a lot of

5802.0 --> 5805.44
shows like me like

5804.4 --> 5806.96
what is it

5805.44 --> 5810.32
it's got almost

5806.96 --> 5813.36
yeah almost 1200 early bird shows yeah

5810.32 --> 5815.679
those are all available right

5813.36 --> 5818.08
i should not be expecting them to be

5815.679 --> 5820.719
able to just have that and have that

5818.08 --> 5823.76
available for viewing all for free

5820.719 --> 5823.76
that's ridiculous

5824.8 --> 5830.4800000000005
i expect that they

5826.88 --> 5834.2390000000005
do that if i give them some ad revenue

5830.48 --> 5834.239
though right then it's worth it

5836.239 --> 5840.879999999999
it's just being fair it doesn't matter

5838.56 --> 5843.280000000001
if there's some freaky mega corporation

5840.88 --> 5845.1990000000005
with a bunch of gay demons at the top

5843.28 --> 5847.599999999999
that doesn't matter it's about the

5845.199 --> 5850.719
principle it's about

5847.6 --> 5852.8
basic commerce

5850.719 --> 5855.36
balance

5852.8 --> 5857.360000000001
you shouldn't just because something is

5855.36 --> 5859.679
technically presented as free doesn't

5857.36 --> 5861.119
mean that you should exploit it until it

5859.679 --> 5862.96
blows up

5861.119 --> 5867.88
yeah

5862.96 --> 5867.88
don't destroy good things

5887.04 --> 5892.199
there's a form of taxation no there's

5889.199 --> 5892.199
not

5896.639 --> 5901.36
not that i know of anyway there's still

5899.119 --> 5902.639
taxation on income though right if you

5901.36 --> 5904.88
get income

5902.639 --> 5906.08
from a corporation including youtube

5904.88 --> 5907.6
yeah you're

5906.08 --> 5908.32
if you

5907.6 --> 5910.0
yeah

5908.32 --> 5912.48
you just have to pay tax over it like

5910.0 --> 5914.719
any income

5912.48 --> 5916.718999999999
yeah

5914.719 --> 5918.4
unless you technically you don't have to

5916.719 --> 5920.32
but if you don't then the federal

5918.4 --> 5922.08
reserve comes after you

5920.32 --> 5924.96
or what is it

5922.08 --> 5927.36
the tax system comes after you the irs

5924.96 --> 5929.36
yeah the federal reserve

5927.36 --> 5930.799999999999
the irs comes after you in america right

5929.36 --> 5932.4
because technically you don't have to

5930.8 --> 5934.400000000001
pay that but if you don't they come

5932.4 --> 5936.638999999999
after you et cetera et cetera in this

5934.4 --> 5939.679
country my country then you do actually

5936.639 --> 5942.159000000001
have to pay that

5939.679 --> 5942.159
it's not

5942.56 --> 5946.639
like

5944.159 --> 5948.879999999999
super protected

5946.639 --> 5950.8
and they don't have a thug agency that

5948.88 --> 5953.84
like makes you do it anyway you really

5950.8 --> 5953.84
just have to do it

5956.32 --> 5960.08
oh youtube taxation

5960.159 --> 5965.638999999999
yeah

5960.96 --> 5965.639
yeah they do take their cut out of it

5967.36 --> 5972.159
and potentially they make a lot of money

5969.36 --> 5973.44
from that as well

5972.159 --> 5976.159
i mean

5973.44 --> 5978.4
just imagine like all these people

5976.159 --> 5981.119
giving other super chats and then every

5978.4 --> 5984.4
single super chat ever

5981.119 --> 5986.96
30 is taken out

5984.4 --> 5988.32
that's a lot of money

5986.96 --> 5990.159
eventually

5988.32 --> 5993.32
right

5990.159 --> 5993.32
a lot

5995.52 --> 6000.159000000001
with that is with very successful

5997.92 --> 6001.76
streams that have a lot of participants

6000.159 --> 6005.119
in the chat

6001.76 --> 6006.08
right and then you get super chats

6005.119 --> 6008.08
so

6006.08 --> 6010.4
yeah i think potentially they make a lot

6008.08 --> 6012.8
of money out of that with like really

6010.4 --> 6014.4
big channels with millions of people and

6012.8 --> 6016.4800000000005
then just

6014.4 --> 6019.28
there's like thousands of dollars of

6016.48 --> 6021.678999999999
super chats every freaking show even if

6019.28 --> 6024.8
it's just half an hour yeah they make a

6021.679 --> 6027.119
lot of money out of that

6024.8 --> 6029.360000000001
i'm not one of those shows though but i

6027.119 --> 6031.44
still have the ads

6029.36 --> 6034.159
for them and

6031.44 --> 6036.719
yeah super chats you can only give them

6034.159 --> 6039.759999999999
during live shows ads

6036.719 --> 6039.76
stay on the show

6040.32 --> 6046.08
so every time somebody watches it the

6042.48 --> 6047.678999999999
ads will be there right so it's not just

6046.08 --> 6049.6
in the moment

6047.679 --> 6051.84
anyway enough about that it's kind of

6049.6 --> 6051.84
boring

6066.8 --> 6073.28
whoa

6068.8 --> 6074.08
95 degrees 90 humidity jesus

6073.28 --> 6077.28
i

6074.08 --> 6081.679
i hope that's 95 fahrenheit

6077.28 --> 6083.679
otherwise you'd literally be in an oven

6081.679 --> 6084.96
with that humidity that's literally

6083.679 --> 6088.92
being cooked

6084.96 --> 6088.92
95 degrees celsius

6108.48 --> 6111.759999999999
i wish the other platforms would get up

6110.56 --> 6115.52
to speed

6111.76 --> 6117.6
nah it's not really going to work though

6115.52 --> 6119.679
i think that actually google has pretty

6117.6 --> 6121.360000000001
much bought up all social media

6119.679 --> 6124.0
platforms

6121.36 --> 6126.719
i'm not even joking

6124.0 --> 6128.48
i think they got their claws into almost

6126.719 --> 6130.4800000000005
everything

6128.48 --> 6132.48
almost everything

6130.48 --> 6134.799999999999
so you thought oh d-life oh it's

6132.48 --> 6138.239
separate oh well guess what

6134.8 --> 6140.639
have exactly the same policy [ __ ]

6138.239 --> 6144.879999999999
oh yeah so does

6140.639 --> 6147.92
pretty much 75 of every alternative

6144.88 --> 6150.08
social media platform out there they all

6147.92 --> 6152.639
have the same rules

6150.08 --> 6155.76
why would that be could it be because

6152.639 --> 6157.52
they're actually owned by all the same

6155.76 --> 6158.4800000000005
company

6157.52 --> 6161.4400000000005
yeah

6158.48 --> 6162.48
that could be very well right because

6161.44 --> 6164.4
what's

6162.48 --> 6166.5599999999995
oh you got a successful social media

6164.4 --> 6169.199
platform what's to prevent

6166.56 --> 6170.2390000000005
a mega corp like google from just like

6169.199 --> 6172.4
hey

6170.239 --> 6173.678999999999
can we buy you

6172.4 --> 6176.5599999999995
is yeah

6173.679 --> 6177.76
would would one billion be enough

6176.56 --> 6182.0
like whoa

6177.76 --> 6182.0
yeah a lot of people are gonna sell out

6182.48 --> 6187.199
not every one of them of course but

6185.84 --> 6188.639
i don't know they're probably not gonna

6187.199 --> 6190.5599999999995
get a billion i don't know how much

6188.639 --> 6194.0
money goes on to that kind of business i

6190.56 --> 6195.360000000001
have no idea how much that would be but

6194.0 --> 6198.4
you get the point

6195.36 --> 6200.88
most of the alternative media platforms

6198.4 --> 6204.199
out there are go owned

6200.88 --> 6204.1990000000005
by google

6204.639 --> 6210.08
or yeah i should say blackrock vanguard

6207.76 --> 6214.159000000001
who are basically the umbrella camp

6210.08 --> 6214.159
companies for all of it including google

6214.32 --> 6216.159
yeah

6215.119 --> 6218.159
so

6216.159 --> 6221.92
why do you think they all have the same

6218.159 --> 6225.44
stupid political [ __ ] rules

6221.92 --> 6225.4400000000005
because it's owned by the same group

6226.0 --> 6230.84
right i'm not too eager to seek out an

6228.48 --> 6233.759999999999
alternative platform

6230.84 --> 6237.119000000001
because like either

6233.76 --> 6239.6
they're just very small and narrow

6237.119 --> 6242.639
and like who's to say they're not gonna

6239.6 --> 6244.2390000000005
be like bought up by freaking google

6242.639 --> 6246.8
again

6244.239 --> 6248.718999999999
after like half a year or a year or who

6246.8 --> 6250.88
knows how long

6248.719 --> 6253.92
right it could just happen and then what

6250.88 --> 6256.32
oh oh i specifically want a platform

6253.92 --> 6259.28
that doesn't have these rules so i can

6256.32 --> 6261.759999999999
specialize in

6259.28 --> 6263.759999999999
like in not giving and [ __ ] about those

6261.76 --> 6266.4800000000005
rules and doing everything the way i

6263.76 --> 6268.88
want and being oppositionally defined

6266.48 --> 6270.638999999999
and then suddenly oh oh no this platform

6268.88 --> 6272.159000000001
has the same rules and and then what

6270.639 --> 6273.84
then you get banned again and then you

6272.159 --> 6274.96
get banned again so is that your stick

6273.84 --> 6277.1990000000005
then

6274.96 --> 6278.96
that you just go from platform to

6277.199 --> 6280.799999999999
platform because you get banned every

6278.96 --> 6283.28
time how are you going to build an

6280.8 --> 6283.28
audience

6284.56 --> 6290.0
right that's pointless unless

6287.28 --> 6292.96
kind of do what owen benjamin did

6290.0 --> 6297.28
or even alex jones and like literally

6292.96 --> 6297.28
from scratch build your own platform

6297.52 --> 6302.4800000000005
like that you're not gonna sell because

6299.36 --> 6305.44
you need it specifically to avoid those

6302.48 --> 6306.48
stupid mega corporation rules

6305.44 --> 6307.839999999999
right

6306.48 --> 6311.04
and then you know it's not going to be

6307.84 --> 6312.88
sold out because it's yours

6311.04 --> 6313.92
right

6312.88 --> 6316.32
but just

6313.92 --> 6318.4800000000005
hopping from one social media group to

6316.32 --> 6320.96
another it's kind of pointless because

6318.48 --> 6322.4
yeah that you might think they're free a

6320.96 --> 6325.679
lot of the times it turns out they're

6322.4 --> 6328.159
just gonna do exactly the same [ __ ]

6325.679 --> 6330.4800000000005
as everybody else with the same stupid

6328.159 --> 6332.159
policy and censorship

6330.48 --> 6335.44
it's all the same

6332.159 --> 6337.679
unless it's your personally owned

6335.44 --> 6340.719
platform

6337.679 --> 6342.159
then nobody's gonna do [ __ ]

6340.719 --> 6345.84
because it's yours

6342.159 --> 6345.839999999999
and you're not part of that policy

6349.52 --> 6352.88
they want people to leave you to

6351.28 --> 6356.4
pigeonhole in the fringe yeah that's

6352.88 --> 6358.639
right that's right exactly cana bear

6356.4 --> 6361.839999999999
and that's the primary reason why i

6358.639 --> 6364.32
don't leave youtube

6361.84 --> 6366.4800000000005
why i try not to and then why i don't

6364.32 --> 6369.119
push them

6366.48 --> 6369.119
on purpose

6369.36 --> 6374.0
i don't try to like oh let's see if i

6371.6 --> 6376.8
can get away with breaking their policy

6374.0 --> 6378.96
rules oh i'm so naughty oh

6376.8 --> 6380.719
yeah that's a complete waste of time

6378.96 --> 6382.159
like you got nothing better to do with

6380.719 --> 6384.8
your life

6382.159 --> 6387.28
than trying to be naughty with the rules

6384.8 --> 6388.8
that's so stupid

6387.28 --> 6391.759999999999
just adapt

6388.8 --> 6394.400000000001
and find a way through oh you can't talk

6391.76 --> 6397.4400000000005
about it then talk about it ten times as

6394.4 --> 6399.28
much slightly modified so it really

6397.44 --> 6400.48
really stands out

6399.28 --> 6403.44
right

6400.48 --> 6404.799999999999
how i talked about the v

6403.44 --> 6405.919999999999
and i

6404.8 --> 6408.4800000000005
and c

6405.92 --> 6411.36
and then constantly explain it

6408.48 --> 6414.4
yeah i if i just said it in that time

6411.36 --> 6415.599999999999
when it was like at high peak censorship

6414.4 --> 6418.08
yeah i would have been screwed they

6415.6 --> 6419.92
would just ban me right i would have no

6418.08 --> 6422.32
more show

6419.92 --> 6424.8
but because i did that and then started

6422.32 --> 6426.5599999999995
talking about it a whole bunch like i

6424.8 --> 6427.76
talked more

6426.56 --> 6430.8
about

6427.76 --> 6432.56
that medical situation

6430.8 --> 6434.2390000000005
i talked more about it than i would

6432.56 --> 6438.080000000001
normally do

6434.239 --> 6440.5599999999995
because it was censored and because i

6438.08 --> 6441.679
adapt it by literally not saying it

6440.56 --> 6444.400000000001
anymore

6441.679 --> 6446.08
yeah so it doesn't really matter i got

6444.4 --> 6448.5599999999995
the message across

6446.08 --> 6451.119
i might have got it more across

6448.56 --> 6453.679
than if they wouldn't have censored it

6451.119 --> 6457.239
that's the lesson that they

6453.679 --> 6457.2390000000005
need to learn

6457.28 --> 6462.32
yeah

6458.8 --> 6464.4800000000005
i'm not going to go to another platform

6462.32 --> 6466.32
just because of their stupid little jump

6464.48 --> 6468.159
through these hoop rules i'm not going

6466.32 --> 6469.679
to do that

6468.159 --> 6473.36
it's pointless

6469.679 --> 6475.1990000000005
just lose the the cohesion

6473.36 --> 6476.719
of the platform

6475.199 --> 6478.638999999999
because this is the best one it's the

6476.719 --> 6481.199
biggest one and the biggest one is the

6478.639 --> 6481.1990000000005
best one

6481.28 --> 6486.4
right even if some really disgusting

6483.84 --> 6488.32
[ __ ] demon sits on on the throne on top

6486.4 --> 6490.239
of it doesn't matter it's still the

6488.32 --> 6492.08
biggest it's the biggest pyramid even if

6490.239 --> 6494.799999999999
there's some facts sitting on top

6492.08 --> 6494.8
doesn't matter

6496.96 --> 6501.719
right

6498.719 --> 6501.719
anyway

6516.159 --> 6520.96
yeah borders boy and that's the weird

6518.239 --> 6520.959999999999
thing about it

6521.28 --> 6526.0
i don't seem to rob

6523.199 --> 6529.199
too many people wrong and i'm really

6526.0 --> 6532.159
surprised because i'm pretty much openly

6529.199 --> 6534.799999999999
declaring violent hostility

6532.159 --> 6536.96
towards them as a unit

6534.8 --> 6539.04
i am i'm like yeah

6536.96 --> 6543.52
i am going to

6539.04 --> 6543.5199999999995
strive to have you all executed

6543.679 --> 6550.32
but maybe they have this weird squirty

6546.48 --> 6550.32
fetish over that so they're like oh

6550.639 --> 6555.4400000000005
i don't know i don't understand

6553.199 --> 6557.36
yeah i've not been removed from paypal

6555.44 --> 6559.598999999999
i've not been removed from patreon i've

6557.36 --> 6561.679
not been removed from youtube they're

6559.599 --> 6564.08
just letting me do that

6561.679 --> 6566.719
and i don't really understand

6564.08 --> 6569.36
i don't but i'm like okay thanks fine

6566.719 --> 6571.36
i'm glad you could just let me do what i

6569.36 --> 6574.32
would want to do i don't understand why

6571.36 --> 6576.799999999999
though why you don't ban me but you ban

6574.32 --> 6577.84
these other people

6576.8 --> 6579.28
i mean

6577.84 --> 6582.159000000001
they're not

6579.28 --> 6584.48
really worse than me there may be a

6582.159 --> 6586.48
little bit more unresponsive

6584.48 --> 6588.48
irresponsible i guess

6586.48 --> 6590.959999999999
but still it just feels weird like why

6588.48 --> 6592.879999999999
would you battle them and and let me do

6590.96 --> 6595.04
what i do

6592.88 --> 6596.96
but fine i'm not complaining i'm not

6595.04 --> 6599.44
complaining for not being banned unlike

6596.96 --> 6601.679
some people that make it their life's

6599.44 --> 6604.638999999999
work to tell everybody that they were

6601.679 --> 6606.8
banned oh i'm so special i got banned oh

6604.639 --> 6609.76
i'm against the system

6606.8 --> 6611.92
i'm being oppressed

6609.76 --> 6614.96
inherent flaw in the system oh i'm

6611.92 --> 6616.32
banned oh yeah nobody gives a [ __ ]

6614.96 --> 6618.4
why don't you just

6616.32 --> 6620.5599999999995
have interesting things to share instead

6618.4 --> 6622.48
of whining all day about how you got

6620.56 --> 6623.679
banned

6622.48 --> 6626.678999999999
all right

6623.679 --> 6626.679
anyway

6640.08 --> 6644.639
i mean i literally don't give a [ __ ]

6641.92 --> 6646.4
about if you got mad i only care if you

6644.639 --> 6648.0
actually had something interesting to

6646.4 --> 6650.08
say

6648.0 --> 6652.159
and then if that gets banned that'll

6650.08 --> 6655.199
piss me off

6652.159 --> 6660.239
but don't start bragging about it

6655.199 --> 6663.36
afterwards it's just annoying and lame

6660.239 --> 6664.839999999999
yeah brag about the information you that

6663.36 --> 6667.44
actually was worth

6664.84 --> 6672.52
it nobody gives a [ __ ] if you were

6667.44 --> 6672.5199999999995
banned literally nobody gives a [ __ ]

6691.679 --> 6695.28
yeah you could do that borders boy

read people's letters and all that

6718.96 --> 6722.32
maybe i would

6720.48 --> 6724.48
but not just unconditionally i'd

6722.32 --> 6726.239

6724.48 --> 6727.44
