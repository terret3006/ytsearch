[Music]

348.0 --> 353.68
if you see this let's help him get to

351.52 --> 354.88
those thousand subscribers and hey if

353.68 --> 357.68
you don't know his channel

354.88 --> 360.08
he has some really good videos so check

357.68 --> 360.08
them out

360.319 --> 367.84000000000003
ah hello cameron kamigaza gilmore

363.919 --> 367.84
good morning to you

377.759 --> 381.84000000000003
so right

382.319 --> 387.84000000000003
yeah own benjamin was live dell went

385.199 --> 387.84000000000003
live again

387.919 --> 392.0
and it was kind of fun being in his chat

392.88 --> 400.56
i had some back and forth communication

395.919 --> 400.56
like i don't know did i just

400.8 --> 405.68
dale has like this special type of

402.88 --> 407.6
attitude that he has had from the start

405.68 --> 410.24
and he's only grown better and more

407.6 --> 412.639
refined at doing what he does

410.24 --> 413.759
and i don't know if yeah he probably

412.639 --> 418.319
doesn't plan it

413.759 --> 420.40000000000003
but his spirit is taking things serious

418.319 --> 421.599
and so yeah sometimes it's really cool

420.4 --> 424.56
to just listen in

421.599 --> 424.56
on what he has to say

426.479 --> 434.84
and he's a guy that yeah is not easily

430.96 --> 437.52
drawn into hopping along on some

434.84 --> 439.919
bandwagon

437.52 --> 440.639
and that way he gives a perspective on

439.919 --> 442.56
things

440.639 --> 444.16
that not a lot of people get to touch

442.56 --> 446.4
upon

444.16 --> 447.36
that aren't just outright rejecting

446.4 --> 450.31899999999996
everything

447.36 --> 452.72
right so yeah i like dell's channel i

450.319 --> 456.8
like what he does

452.72 --> 456.8
it makes me think and i appreciate that

458.8 --> 464.40000000000003
over yeah beyond the imaginary curve

461.84 --> 465.84
right that wasn't the name of his

464.4 --> 468.31899999999996
channel

465.84 --> 469.84
uh also martin litke of course flatter

468.319 --> 473.759
day night

469.84 --> 476.56
with some weird things like

473.759 --> 477.84000000000003
yeah like i got in there i didn't watch

476.56 --> 479.52
the whole thing because i was just

477.84 --> 481.35999999999996
watching all kinds of stuff

479.52 --> 482.79999999999995
including the flat earth debates from

481.36 --> 486.16
wednesday replay

482.8 --> 489.759
premiere over nathan oakley's and

486.16 --> 491.59900000000005
to be fair so yeah i just find that a

489.759 --> 492.0
lot more amusing sometimes but it's

491.599 --> 496.639
because

492.0 --> 496.639
i'm like really in the in the deep of it

498.24 --> 502.40000000000003
like i really just appreciate the flat

500.319 --> 504.47900000000004
earth debate channel

502.4 --> 506.87899999999996
and what nathan does and being part of

504.479 --> 508.08
it so watching it back is a great joy to

506.879 --> 510.72
me

508.08 --> 512.24
it's not always you know i'm not always

510.72 --> 516.479
in the mood but a lot of times i

512.24 --> 518.839
am but martin lipka was also interesting

516.479 --> 521.2
he brought up this weird thing about red

518.839 --> 525.12
mercury

521.2 --> 527.6800000000001
and didn't present any video footage

525.12 --> 529.519
but he laid down the suggestion it's a

527.68 --> 533.4399999999999
really weird one

529.519 --> 537.36
that for some reason red mercury is not

533.44 --> 542.5600000000001
reflected in mirrors

537.36 --> 542.5600000000001
yeah that sounded like a total yeah

543.12 --> 548.72
just a goofy conspiracy but i don't know

547.04 --> 550.48
maybe it's true i've never seen it

548.72 --> 553.0400000000001
demonstrated

550.48 --> 555.04
you know i also said like okay so where

553.04 --> 556.7199999999999
is the the footage the camera footage

555.04 --> 558.64
you know a picture can be easily

556.72 --> 561.6800000000001
photoshopped like it can

558.64 --> 562.08
so if people out there decided to spread

561.68 --> 566.16
this

562.08 --> 567.76
hype this mr mysterious magical ability

566.16 --> 569.4399999999999
then with photoshop they could have just

567.76 --> 570.88
done that and

569.44 --> 572.6400000000001
multiple people like they could

570.88 --> 574.959
literally just

572.64 --> 576.0
basically troll the world with that if

574.959 --> 578.0
they chose to

576.0 --> 580.08
and if that is actually what's going on

578.0 --> 583.04
but who knows maybe it's

580.08 --> 584.08
real would be pretty cool to just see

583.04 --> 587.68
yeah one of those

584.08 --> 590.24
gems as suggested by the pictures that

587.68 --> 592.3199999999999
martin also shared see that with a

590.24 --> 594.9590000000001
camera

592.32 --> 597.6
mirror behind it and moving around it's

594.959 --> 600.4799999999999
like oh really so

597.6 --> 603.2
maybe physically moving the mirror

600.48 --> 606.32
instead of the camera too sometimes to

603.2 --> 609.12
to make to make it more clear

606.32 --> 611.279
like is this real and i'd love to see it

609.12 --> 615.2
with my own eyes sometimes

611.279 --> 615.2
so it's something that i'll keep in mind

615.6 --> 620.24
it's definitely something i want to

617.68 --> 622.88
check out whether that's real

620.24 --> 623.6
but anyway martin latched on to the

622.88 --> 626.079
concept

623.6 --> 627.0400000000001
and then drew in all kinds of conspiracy

626.079 --> 633.5999999999999
theories about

627.04 --> 635.68
the past and like how to hide

633.6 --> 637.76
using mirrors that could have been

635.68 --> 641.76
observing mediums

637.76 --> 641.76
like it was really a weird

642.0 --> 645.839
conspiracy put down but it's kind of

644.079 --> 646.959
fascinating like that would work for

645.839 --> 649.839
like a sci-fi

646.959 --> 649.8389999999999
book or yeah

650.72 --> 655.12
but that did kind of stood out to me

652.24 --> 655.12
when he brought that up

655.2 --> 658.399
but i got very empirical with it and so

658.0 --> 660.88
yeah

658.399 --> 661.839
i don't buy these things outright i

660.88 --> 665.2
really do need

661.839 --> 668.9590000000001
need to see demonstrations

665.2 --> 671.76
but it is fascinating if that's true

668.959 --> 672.4799999999999
anyway that happened that's pretty much

671.76 --> 675.92
it

672.48 --> 679.519
flat earth debate i didn't go to

675.92 --> 682.399
bed that late at all actually went to

679.519 --> 682.399
bed pretty early

684.56 --> 690.64
uh shoulders doing

688.16 --> 692.24
okay it seems the tension seems a little

690.64 --> 695.4399999999999
bit back up

692.24 --> 702.8
but it's okay it's still

695.44 --> 708.0790000000001
doing quite good

702.8 --> 708.079
blood concrete well yeah sure

713.12 --> 716.16
yeah and a comic book written in blood

715.2 --> 718.639
too and

716.16 --> 720.48
like blood grafted in the ink there's

718.639 --> 721.519
all kinds of weird stuff going on with

720.48 --> 726.32
blood

721.519 --> 726.32
and the idea of blood magic and all that

728.959 --> 734.6389999999999
but yeah but the

732.399 --> 736.639
red mercury part that was really

734.639 --> 740.9590000000001
interesting i'm curious this

736.639 --> 744.5600000000001
to test whether that is real or not

740.959 --> 748.4799999999999
all right uh hello by the way

744.56 --> 750.959
seeking star water and neil cosentino

748.48 --> 753.36
i love the debate show too good to see

750.959 --> 759.28
you ah amanda jung

753.36 --> 765.039
good morning

759.28 --> 765.039
[Music]

766.48 --> 771.76
right one weird thing that did kind of

768.24 --> 773.76
stood out to me last night

771.76 --> 776.079
don't know it doesn't need to be of a

773.76 --> 781.519
lot of consequence

776.079 --> 783.76
but like it's probably because of easter

781.519 --> 784.88
that like a lot of darkness kind of

783.76 --> 788.24
rolled over

784.88 --> 789.8389999999999
my imagination at one point pretty much

788.24 --> 793.6
when i was trying to go to bed

789.839 --> 796.48
now i managed to basically invoke

793.6 --> 797.6
pray to christ in the way that i do the

796.48 --> 800.8000000000001
combat chant

797.6 --> 803.2
as i kind of call it to get that

800.8 --> 804.88
out but it really stood out like wow

803.2 --> 809.6
that

804.88 --> 813.92
that just came making a visit to my mind

809.6 --> 814.48
not very pleasant so i don't know maybe

813.92 --> 817.8389999999999
easter

814.48 --> 820.72
is a time when there's just dark [ __ ]

817.839 --> 820.72
happening out there

822.0 --> 827.04
or maybe it is a lot of people imagining

824.88 --> 828.56
it and that way heightening the tension

827.04 --> 830.48
to that frequency

828.56 --> 832.079
and that i picked that up i don't know

830.48 --> 834.72
what it was

832.079 --> 835.68
but i got rid of it and i did go to

834.72 --> 838.5600000000001
sleep and had a

835.68 --> 838.56
really good rest

839.36 --> 847.92
oh hello logan's run matthew eastman

844.16 --> 847.92
wdp 2020

852.079 --> 857.8389999999999
so yeah today it's the first easter day

868.839 --> 871.839
goody

875.12 --> 877.44
right

878.48 --> 884.639
and i'm all stocked up on eggs

881.6 --> 887.0400000000001
i was sure to buy like an extra carton

884.639 --> 889.36
sometime before in the case that there

887.04 --> 891.12
would be a sudden egg shortage because

889.36 --> 891.76
that happens sometimes during this

891.12 --> 893.519
period

891.76 --> 894.959
a lot of people get very nutty with the

893.519 --> 898.0
eggs like

894.959 --> 900.7199999999999
make giant omelets and all that so i

898.0 --> 901.36
was i made sure that i get enough eggs

900.72 --> 903.839
for this

901.36 --> 903.839
period

909.44 --> 913.9200000000001
yeah and i'm not really getting into the

911.279 --> 917.199
chocolate eggs and stuff

913.92 --> 919.8389999999999
it's it's kind of expensive

917.199 --> 921.76
the organic variety i don't blame them

919.839 --> 924.8800000000001
it's just that

921.76 --> 927.04
i don't know i try to stay away from

924.88 --> 929.04
that

927.04 --> 930.639
from candy anyway including chocolate i

929.04 --> 931.199
don't really buy chocolate anymore i

930.639 --> 933.36
used to be

931.199 --> 937.3599999999999
really addicted to chocolate but i

933.36 --> 940.72
managed to wean myself off it completely

937.36 --> 944.72
so i just yeah the only thing close

940.72 --> 944.72
i even take is really just coffee

944.8 --> 948.88
and yeah chocolate kind of in a way is

946.8 --> 951.04
like a soft coffee

948.88 --> 954.16
but it also does have like the same

951.04 --> 959.199
negative influences when you take a lot

954.16 --> 959.199
it's weird so no more chocolate for me

959.6 --> 963.839
for a while as sometimes i do take a

962.639 --> 966.0
bite

963.839 --> 968.9590000000001
but it's just very rare i've really got

966.0 --> 972.399
it out of my system

968.959 --> 975.279
so yeah the chocolate easter eggs is

972.399 --> 977.04
it's all staring at me but it's not

975.279 --> 979.8389999999999
doing anything

977.04 --> 980.16
except maybe making me think back when i

979.839 --> 983.839
was

980.16 --> 983.8389999999999
a little kid

994.639 --> 998.639
okay finally cannon

1000.88 --> 1011.8389999999999
i didn't know you were such a pronounced

1003.519 --> 1011.839
pagan like that

1022.88 --> 1025.839
my

1027.839 --> 1031.9189999999999
okay mars rover camera turning around to

1030.72 --> 1036.88
see earth spin

1031.919 --> 1042.0
really so are they actually giving shots

1036.88 --> 1042.0
to up there and the earth in the sky

1042.799 --> 1047.9189999999999
how did they arrange the heavens the

1045.839 --> 1050.6399999999999
heavenly bodies in their

1047.919 --> 1050.64
coordinates

1051.2 --> 1055.3600000000001
because i guess in the heliocentric

1053.52 --> 1055.76
model all the stars and all that should

1055.36 --> 1058.8799999999999
be

1055.76 --> 1060.64
roughly in the same place but like the

1058.88 --> 1063.1200000000001
planetary

1060.64 --> 1064.24
arrangement and the sun location should

1063.12 --> 1067.4399999999998
be quite different

1064.24 --> 1070.48
since mars is in another orbit

1067.44 --> 1071.44
right that's going to be a chore to get

1070.48 --> 1074.799
that all right

1071.44 --> 1081.8400000000001
in any kind of heavenly body sighting

1074.799 --> 1081.84
from mars supposedly

1084.799 --> 1095.84
all right

1108.16 --> 1111.28
oh all right neil

1112.64 --> 1116.3200000000002
that's a nice visualization

1116.559 --> 1120.48
i get more specific but yeah it's pretty

1120.0 --> 1124.24
much

1120.48 --> 1125.28
i basically call upon the archangel

1124.24 --> 1128.4
michael

1125.28 --> 1128.3999999999999
angel of justice

1131.36 --> 1137.039
to pretty much yeah defend me against

1135.2 --> 1139.039
the dark influences

1137.039 --> 1140.24
first i call on christ to basically

1139.039 --> 1143.919
purge

1140.24 --> 1145.36
the darkness out of there then i call

1143.919 --> 1148.3200000000002
upon michael to

1145.36 --> 1150.1599999999999
basically help me shield me outside of

1148.32 --> 1153.4399999999998
my consciousness

1150.16 --> 1157.039
from the external influences and then i

1153.44 --> 1159.039
call upon like if it really

1157.039 --> 1161.28
got me like emotionally messed up a

1159.039 --> 1163.12
little because sometimes it does that

1161.28 --> 1164.48
like there's experience like i'm

1163.12 --> 1166.32
sensitive

1164.48 --> 1167.679
even ideas can be quite torture

1166.32 --> 1171.28
sometimes

1167.679 --> 1173.679
so then

1171.28 --> 1174.48
if it made a big impact i usually also

1173.679 --> 1177.6000000000001
invoke

1174.48 --> 1178.08
archangel gabriel to as i say put my

1177.6 --> 1181.4399999999998
heart

1178.08 --> 1181.4399999999998
back in the right place

1181.76 --> 1193.84
and that's how i do it

1204.84 --> 1207.84
so

1216.96 --> 1221.8400000000001
okay so you can start water

1225.2 --> 1228.96
thoughts on neo-paganism and being

1227.36 --> 1232.799
christian too

1228.96 --> 1235.679
well that doesn't really work look

1232.799 --> 1237.36
what you said earlier it's like why

1235.679 --> 1240.24
would you call that a goddess why don't

1237.36 --> 1242.7199999999998
you just call that a spirit

1240.24 --> 1245.6
how is it a goddess that's like

1242.72 --> 1249.84
personifying it

1245.6 --> 1249.84
separating it

1259.039 --> 1262.72
right because yeah christianity is also

1261.76 --> 1266.8799999999999
it's a discipline

1262.72 --> 1270.88
it's a focus you should not be

1266.88 --> 1273.919
declaring gods basically

1270.88 --> 1275.8400000000001
other than the god that's that's a

1273.919 --> 1278.0
bigger part of the issue because of

1275.84 --> 1279.84
its psychological influence that it has

1278.0 --> 1283.2
on you because when you do

1279.84 --> 1286.24
do that the ego kind of

1283.2 --> 1289.1200000000001
takes use of that

1286.24 --> 1290.24
it will over time it will take a grip on

1289.12 --> 1292.2399999999998
you

1290.24 --> 1294.48
and basically allow certain type of

1292.24 --> 1296.4
arrogant attitudes this is a natural

1294.48 --> 1300.24
effect from that

1296.4 --> 1303.3600000000001
that's why i just don't start pointing

1300.24 --> 1303.36
declaring gods

1303.52 --> 1308.1589999999999
even from within paganism like even with

1306.559 --> 1311.44
the pantheon

1308.159 --> 1314.88
like when i mention any of this

1311.44 --> 1317.6000000000001
i always see it as it's kind of like an

1314.88 --> 1319.679
aberration it's just a manifestation as

1317.6 --> 1321.4399999999998
a side effect from creation it's a

1319.679 --> 1325.919
spirit that is

1321.44 --> 1330.3200000000002
manifested by how things work

1325.919 --> 1334.159
so like that like the gods

1330.32 --> 1337.039
or as you said like the god of spring

1334.159 --> 1337.0390000000002
what is it what you said

1338.08 --> 1341.6789999999999
yeah the goddess of spring it's

1340.799 --> 1344.8799999999999
secondary

1341.679 --> 1348.5590000000002
it's not a primary entity creating it

1344.88 --> 1351.919
no it creates

1348.559 --> 1355.52
the vision the focus

1351.919 --> 1358.88
the image the yeah within the mind

1355.52 --> 1360.559
of that goddess as you call it

1358.88 --> 1362.4
and that's why i'd prefer to call it a

1360.559 --> 1366.0
spirit

1362.4 --> 1366.0
right that's the way i do that

1368.4 --> 1372.88
or all avatars of this well yeah that's

1370.64 --> 1375.8400000000001
one way of putting it

1372.88 --> 1375.8400000000001
but

1379.28 --> 1382.8799999999999
like when you reason things out like

1381.44 --> 1386.72
that almost

1382.88 --> 1389.7600000000002
everything can be right it's all

1386.72 --> 1392.48
one creation it's all faces

1389.76 --> 1393.52
within creation that prove the creator

1392.48 --> 1396.88
so

1393.52 --> 1399.039
why separate these supposed avatars

1396.88 --> 1401.44
and then assign them as being part of a

1399.039 --> 1403.6
godhead

1401.44 --> 1404.799
and not just realize that there is

1403.6 --> 1409.28
basically

1404.799 --> 1413.44
it's just creation proving itself again

1409.28 --> 1413.44
directed by the original creator and

1414.84 --> 1417.84
designer

1435.93 --> 1439.069
[Music]

1450.0 --> 1453.679
one god many fragments but if you're

1452.159 --> 1455.6000000000001
going to call it free yeah

1453.679 --> 1457.3600000000001
i understand what you mean moth eyes but

1455.6 --> 1459.84
if you're going to call it that

1457.36 --> 1460.9099999999999
that kind of suggests that god is

1459.84 --> 1462.3999999999999
fragmented

1460.91 --> 1465.1200000000001
[Music]

1462.4 --> 1465.1200000000001
and he's not

1465.76 --> 1470.8799999999999
so i'd rather just see it reflections of

1471.36 --> 1487.84
aspects being reflected within creation

1488.88 --> 1491.279
what

1497.6 --> 1503.76
you include that chart which chart is

1500.559 --> 1506.0
that seeking star water

1503.76 --> 1506.0
what

1506.88 --> 1529.8400000000001
oh with the angel correspondence of

1510.64 --> 1529.8400000000001
the day the shem angels that one alright

1540.84 --> 1543.84
mm-hmm

1554.84 --> 1562.559
what

1557.039 --> 1562.559
break dance donkey

1568.84 --> 1571.84
that's

1575.76 --> 1583.279
i don't know anybody named ken

1579.559 --> 1586.559
wdp2020 literally

1583.279 --> 1599.84
i've never had anybody i've never met

1586.559 --> 1599.84
anybody in real life named ken

1602.0 --> 1604.4
and it

1610.799 --> 1615.2
no clutch bear i've not heard of

1612.799 --> 1627.84
emmanuel swedenborg

1615.2 --> 1627.8400000000001
never heard of it

1627.919 --> 1631.5200000000002
swedish theologian

1638.84 --> 1641.84
hmm

1644.159 --> 1655.8400000000001
from the 1700s and 1800s

1667.36 --> 1669.84
hmm

1711.279 --> 1713.6
hmm

1717.52 --> 1725.84
i'm just reading through the wiki

1734.88 --> 1738.0
right this is dude that's gonna take

1737.52 --> 1740.6399999999999
some time

1738.0 --> 1744.559
to read through all that i'm not gonna

1740.64 --> 1744.5590000000002
do that right now but it is interesting

1745.279 --> 1748.96
i don't remember having having bumped

1748.08 --> 1753.84
into

1748.96 --> 1753.8400000000001
that figure like reading about it before

1754.0 --> 1767.84
but so far he does sound interesting

1779.76 --> 1784.8799999999999
right it's funny because even like the

1783.52 --> 1788.08
painting of him there

1784.88 --> 1791.6000000000001
the portrait like his eyes

1788.08 --> 1795.52
just reveal like a spark

1791.6 --> 1798.7199999999998
that's really interesting to see

1795.52 --> 1801.76
like there's the painter

1798.72 --> 1805.6000000000001
yeah really put that in there

1801.76 --> 1805.6
that's pretty remarkable person

1807.52 --> 1812.72
but yeah i don't really i'd have to read

1809.919 --> 1812.72
deeper into it

1818.24 --> 1824.08
we talking about emmanuel swedenborg so

1822.159 --> 1828.3200000000002
here is the wiki

1824.08 --> 1828.32
so you can look at it yourself

1828.88 --> 1835.2
it's a big one right so i don't have

1832.559 --> 1839.039
time to read it all right now

1835.2 --> 1842.3990000000001
he ran with the newton crowd hey

1839.039 --> 1845.6
i like newton i

1842.399 --> 1848.2399999999998
i saw him as a devout christian

1845.6 --> 1851.84
that also happened to dabble into some

1848.24 --> 1851.84
heliocentric philosophy

1877.519 --> 1881.84
okay clutch bear well that sounds kind

1880.72 --> 1885.3600000000001
of like something i'm

1881.84 --> 1887.84
absolutely not interested in vr already

1885.36 --> 1890.9599999999998
saying oh i don't agree with it all

1887.84 --> 1892.559
but some things oh yeah oh wow what else

1890.96 --> 1894.3990000000001
is out there where you agree

1892.559 --> 1896.1589999999999
with some things and the rest is

1894.399 --> 1907.84
complete garbage

1896.159 --> 1907.8400000000001
yeah i know that's a lot not interested

1929.039 --> 1933.76
and every time people do that you know

1931.6 --> 1936.1589999999999
when they choose a name like that ooh

1933.76 --> 1939.519
over the left eye

1936.159 --> 1940.3990000000001
it's bad news they're either virtue

1939.519 --> 1943.679
signaling to

1940.399 --> 1947.039
illuminati [ __ ] or

1943.679 --> 1950.24
they are literally polluted by that

1947.039 --> 1950.24
yeah occultism

1950.48 --> 1955.039
this is not good either way don't do

1960.84 --> 1963.84
that

1978.799 --> 1983.84
why did you bring it up then uh whatever

1981.36 --> 1986.8799999999999
it's fine

1983.84 --> 1988.9599999999998
i'm just giving you my response

1986.88 --> 1991.8400000000001
so a lot of bears do that by the way

1988.96 --> 1991.8400000000001
typically

1994.64 --> 1997.76
because yeah there's a lot of channels

1996.64 --> 2001.8400000000001
out there a

1997.76 --> 2004.64
lot of channels i am just one channel

2001.84 --> 2008.24
there is millions of people out there

2004.64 --> 2008.24
and they're all doing their own thing

2009.519 --> 2012.559
and a lot of it is

2012.88 --> 2021.2
yeah it's dwelling they're just dwelling

2016.96 --> 2023.76
right and within their dwell

2021.2 --> 2026.32
like they are directionless in ways

2023.76 --> 2029.679
they're just

2026.32 --> 2031.36
going with whatever wind is around

2029.679 --> 2034.0
they're they're just dwelling they don't

2031.36 --> 2036.4799999999998
have a long-term path

2034.0 --> 2038.559
they don't have logos foundations or

2036.48 --> 2040.72
they're having just oh yeah i'm picking

2038.559 --> 2042.0
up logos i do recognize there's

2040.72 --> 2044.32
something

2042.0 --> 2045.12
not gonna do anything with it though

2044.32 --> 2048.48
right that

2045.12 --> 2052.0
there's a lot of that that's why

2048.48 --> 2054.8
yeah i don't watch that [ __ ] i don't get

2052.0 --> 2054.8
caught up in that

2058.32 --> 2063.9190000000003
like i only really in a way i only like

2061.839 --> 2064.48
to associate with people that are

2063.919 --> 2067.919
walking

2064.48 --> 2070.56
the path now

2067.919 --> 2072.839
do they have to call it the path do they

2070.56 --> 2076.159
have to call it the path of christ

2072.839 --> 2077.7599999999998
no it doesn't have to be named they just

2076.159 --> 2081.04
have to be doing it

2077.76 --> 2083.28
like in their essence in their person

2081.04 --> 2084.48
they have to do it and if they don't do

2083.28 --> 2087.3590000000004
it

2084.48 --> 2089.119
it's not worth wasting my time and

2087.359 --> 2092.0
energy on

2089.119 --> 2094.2400000000002
so just fooling around or virtue

2092.0 --> 2103.839
sickening to trying to do something good

2094.24 --> 2103.839
that's completely useless

2106.079 --> 2111.8390000000004
focus and direction

2109.68 --> 2114.3999999999996
that's what it's all about focus and

2111.839 --> 2118.48
direction

2114.4 --> 2118.48
when you have focus and direction then

2119.76 --> 2123.119
well then it's going somewhere and you

2122.64 --> 2126.0789999999997
can

2123.119 --> 2127.599
and others can tune into it and see

2126.079 --> 2130.0
where it's going at

2127.599 --> 2131.839
then you cross reference that insight

2130.0 --> 2133.76
that spiritual insight about

2131.839 --> 2135.52
something and where it's going to the

2133.76 --> 2139.119
rest of the world

2135.52 --> 2144.4
and then figure out what its purpose is

2139.119 --> 2144.8
to into the future as it were right if

2144.4 --> 2148.1600000000003
they're

2144.8 --> 2151.2000000000003
directionless it's just up for grabs

2148.16 --> 2153.1189999999997
or ego or worse

2151.2 --> 2155.04
could just step in any moment and just

2153.119 --> 2159.839
ruin it all because it doesn't mean

2155.04 --> 2159.839
anything to them

2182.88 --> 2188.88
all right clutch bear that's fine not

2186.24 --> 2190.0
being angry for you doing that it's just

2188.88 --> 2192.079
that

2190.0 --> 2193.599
i find it very telling a lot of bears do

2192.079 --> 2196.7200000000003
that

2193.599 --> 2197.52
then again there is like a secondary

2196.72 --> 2200.48
function

2197.52 --> 2201.7599999999998
i guess to the bear network and that is

2200.48 --> 2204.16
spiritual scouts

2201.76 --> 2206.6400000000003
a lot of you do that i've noticed this

2204.16 --> 2207.839
bears go out and spiritually scout

2206.64 --> 2210.7999999999997
channels

2207.839 --> 2213.599
they literally go out and fishing even

2210.8 --> 2215.76
in the wilds even in the boonies

2213.599 --> 2217.92
because you never know what you might

2215.76 --> 2218.5600000000004
fish up oh yeah a lot of garbage a lot

2217.92 --> 2221.6800000000003
of

2218.56 --> 2223.839
[ __ ] darkness goo but

2221.68 --> 2224.96
sometimes something really unexpected

2223.839 --> 2228.32
and that's typically

2224.96 --> 2229.76
like a bear thing that's what i've

2228.32 --> 2243.839
noticed

2229.76 --> 2243.8390000000004
a lot of bears do that

2246.72 --> 2251.359
got some controversial books do you need

2249.839 --> 2256.96
a broad range

2251.359 --> 2260.0789999999997
to get a better picture

2256.96 --> 2262.16
well i see it like this

2260.079 --> 2264.32
like if there's a book and you just know

2262.16 --> 2266.3999999999996
it's bad news in certain ways

2264.32 --> 2268.6400000000003
then at least you have it for study in

2266.4 --> 2270.88
order to realize what kind of

2268.64 --> 2272.4
influence it will have on the other

2270.88 --> 2274.48
people that read it

2272.4 --> 2275.839
and that might not pick up on its dark

2274.48 --> 2278.2400000000002
influences right

2275.839 --> 2280.16
that's a good reason to have something

2278.24 --> 2283.4399999999996
like that

2280.16 --> 2299.839
as a reflector to know its influence by

2283.44 --> 2299.839
its existence

2305.119 --> 2310.88
one or cold practice is calling on

2307.68 --> 2314.3199999999997
angels to help oh yeah well i do that

2310.88 --> 2314.32
is that enough called practice

2319.359 --> 2325.359
like i did maybe

2322.56 --> 2327.52
i don't know man but i know that when i

2325.359 --> 2332.0789999999997
do it

2327.52 --> 2335.92
i am basically walking up

2332.079 --> 2339.76
to god's court and you can't

2335.92 --> 2342.32
just demand something right if you don't

2339.76 --> 2345.28
actually

2342.32 --> 2346.1600000000003
have your spirit on the right side if

2345.28 --> 2348.48
you don't know

2346.16 --> 2351.44
like if you don't admit to your flaws

2348.48 --> 2353.599
and your wrongdoings

2351.44 --> 2355.599
and build towards something better built

2353.599 --> 2357.52
towards god if you don't do that yeah

2355.599 --> 2361.3590000000004
you can call on angels

2357.52 --> 2361.359
i don't know what its effects would be

2363.28 --> 2366.88
could be all kinds of weird issues you

2365.359 --> 2370.16
know

2366.88 --> 2373.76
like even my healer has like

2370.16 --> 2376.0789999999997
is guided by a very specific rule set

2373.76 --> 2378.079
where literally his guides that do a lot

2376.079 --> 2379.76
of things

2378.079 --> 2381.28
like that help the healing even at a

2379.76 --> 2384.2400000000002
distance

2381.28 --> 2384.8
like they have rules to follow and some

2384.24 --> 2388.7999999999997
people

2384.8 --> 2391.76
that are like on a deviant path

2388.8 --> 2392.48
where they've really decided to go like

2391.76 --> 2397.28
they're not

2392.48 --> 2401.359
allowed to be helped you understand

2397.28 --> 2406.079
they're not allowed to be helped

2401.359 --> 2409.7599999999998
by the spirits by those guides

2406.079 --> 2412.8
on the god side mind you because

2409.76 --> 2415.0400000000004
that's the rules

2412.8 --> 2415.04
right

2416.48 --> 2419.68
and it's a big difference between when

2418.319 --> 2422.48
somebody just

2419.68 --> 2423.1189999999997
stumbles in the moment just loses his

2422.48 --> 2425.92
bearings

2423.119 --> 2427.6800000000003
loses his focus and might get a caught

2425.92 --> 2430.96
up in some dark

2427.68 --> 2432.96
delusion because when that happens

2430.96 --> 2434.079
it's purely accidental like

2432.96 --> 2436.319
disorientation

2434.079 --> 2437.76
and then the spirits are definitely

2436.319 --> 2441.04
allowed to help

2437.76 --> 2442.4
remove that but if somebody got in that

2441.04 --> 2445.52
position

2442.4 --> 2449.2000000000003
by their conscious choosing

2445.52 --> 2452.72
through their ego then they're not

2449.2 --> 2456.3999999999996
allowed to be helped

2452.72 --> 2456.3999999999996
by my healer really

2460.48 --> 2465.359
and i totally get that now first when i

2463.68 --> 2469.68
heard that is like what

2465.359 --> 2469.68
what but that's how it works

2472.4 --> 2476.079
and the longer i've been sitting on that

2475.359 --> 2479.44
inside

2476.079 --> 2483.44
the more sense it's starting to make

2479.44 --> 2485.68
over time because yeah everybody needs

2483.44 --> 2488.0
to make their mistakes and when they

2485.68 --> 2491.52
engage in it

2488.0 --> 2494.64
it's like they have to

2491.52 --> 2509.28
finish making it you can't

2494.64 --> 2511.2
prevent them from making their mistake

2509.28 --> 2512.48
because you have to be careful what you

2511.2 --> 2514.24
invite in right

2512.48 --> 2516.319
or what you invite in that's like a

2514.24 --> 2519.04
possession possessive idea

2516.319 --> 2520.24
but yes allah what you are going to

2519.04 --> 2522.64
engage with

2520.24 --> 2524.7999999999997
what your plan is what you want for the

2522.64 --> 2527.2
future for yourself

2524.8 --> 2528.0
where you foresee it going and decisions

2527.2 --> 2529.7599999999998
you make in it

2528.0 --> 2531.04
if you set your mind on something that

2529.76 --> 2534.079
is kind of like

2531.04 --> 2537.2799999999997
partially or completely a dark path

2534.079 --> 2540.88
then suddenly you're literally not

2537.28 --> 2544.2400000000002
allowed to be relieved

2540.88 --> 2544.2400000000002
from the side effects

2545.92 --> 2551.839
how astounding is that

2570.01 --> 2573.92
[Music]

2571.839 --> 2576.48
and i think the funny thing also is is

2573.92 --> 2579.2000000000003
that a lot of people that

2576.48 --> 2580.319
are very stable social and intuitive

2579.2 --> 2583.4399999999996
senses they do

2580.319 --> 2586.48
also just know that intuitively if

2583.44 --> 2589.2000000000003
somebody's engaging in a serious mistake

2586.48 --> 2589.68
and they've set their mind to it you

2589.2 --> 2592.24
can't

2589.68 --> 2594.0789999999997
really stop them you could basically

2592.24 --> 2596.72
give them a hint

2594.079 --> 2598.079
carefully but you can't like try to

2596.72 --> 2601.68
break into their

2598.079 --> 2603.92
personality like a parent would with a

2601.68 --> 2607.68
kid

2603.92 --> 2611.04
that can't really work it's

2607.68 --> 2613.359
it's the design it's all the design all

2611.04 --> 2613.359
of it

2614.0 --> 2621.839
it's just how it's how it works

2617.599 --> 2621.839
pretty amazing

2646.839 --> 2649.839
so

2669.2 --> 2674.0789999999997
what is hidden from us is hidden for a

2671.2 --> 2677.839
reason the grand dissension

2674.079 --> 2677.8390000000004
what do you mean

2679.04 --> 2683.04
how is that hidden from us

2684.16 --> 2688.3999999999996
i think it's actually quite visible for

2686.72 --> 2692.48
us for everybody

2688.4 --> 2696.2400000000002
it's just the person engaging in it

2692.48 --> 2696.2400000000002
it's often hidden to them

2696.4 --> 2700.1600000000003
right

2698.27 --> 2701.92
[Music]

2700.16 --> 2703.5989999999997
but to others it's visible when

2701.92 --> 2707.2000000000003
somebody's engaging in sin

2703.599 --> 2711.119
is freaking visible as [ __ ]

2707.2 --> 2714.319
okay but the person that's doing it

2711.119 --> 2716.839
they've obviously blinded themselves

2714.319 --> 2718.24
to that or they wouldn't be able to

2716.839 --> 2720.72
engage

2718.24 --> 2722.72
because then their inner mechanisms

2720.72 --> 2725.04
would stop them

2722.72 --> 2726.48
if they have any left they didn't break

2725.04 --> 2730.319
it apart

2726.48 --> 2733.839
on purpose because their ego just didn't

2730.319 --> 2733.839
want to deal with it anymore

2760.48 --> 2764.0
iphone x flight routes tell you it's

2762.72 --> 2766.3999999999996
flat

2764.0 --> 2768.079
i don't know if it does but i do know

2766.4 --> 2771.839
that

2768.079 --> 2774.8
airplanes move perfectly straight

2771.839 --> 2778.0
on average they don't go over a curve

2774.8 --> 2778.0
they have a gyroscope

2778.88 --> 2783.6800000000003
to basically give them their orientation

2781.92 --> 2787.04
very quickly

2783.68 --> 2789.7599999999998
and it does not turn as the airplane

2787.04 --> 2792.0
flies over a vast distance at great

2789.76 --> 2794.079
speeds

2792.0 --> 2803.839
the gyroscope's not turning and neither

2794.079 --> 2803.8390000000004
is the plane

2820.63 --> 2825.879
[Music]

2828.839 --> 2831.839
hmm

2832.58 --> 2835.869
[Music]

2838.35 --> 2848.04
[Music]

2856.559 --> 2860.079
all right well that's one way of saying

2859.04 --> 2862.96
it moth eyes

2860.079 --> 2864.319
satan's plan is to capture our souls it

2862.96 --> 2868.64
was god's idea

2864.319 --> 2868.64
or you could say satan's plan

2868.72 --> 2874.8799999999997
is for people to

2872.0 --> 2875.359
want through their ego want to be like

2874.88 --> 2878.96
him

2875.359 --> 2883.92
a ruler of the material

2878.96 --> 2885.68
and by that will discard their souls

2883.92 --> 2888.319
like satan makes people do it to

2885.68 --> 2888.319
themselves

2889.52 --> 2896.4
and after they're done satan's usually

2893.52 --> 2901.839
disappointed that's when everything and

2896.4 --> 2901.839
everyone abandons the one that did that

2902.0 --> 2904.88
it's weird isn't it

2907.52 --> 2912.88
that's just natural

2910.72 --> 2915.1189999999997
yeah it's part of the design it's the

2912.88 --> 2928.0
punishment it's god's punishment

2915.119 --> 2931.28
what happens

2928.0 --> 2933.2
dear let me put turn that off

2931.28 --> 2943.8390000000004
or it's going to be pop-up sound from

2933.2 --> 2943.839
skype constantly

2949.599 --> 2957.839
seeking start what

2972.72 --> 2985.839
bully mentality laugh what what are you

2975.76 --> 2985.8390000000004
talking about iron fee

2993.119 --> 2997.6800000000003
are you seems like you're describing

2995.599 --> 3002.6400000000003
what's going to be left after that

2997.68 --> 3005.7599999999998
after you yeah relinquish your soul

3002.64 --> 3006.0789999999997
then yeah your ego is gonna drive things

3005.76 --> 3007.92
and

3006.079 --> 3010.4
packing order and [ __ ] is going to

3007.92 --> 3013.76
become more predominant

3010.4 --> 3016.8
and thus you will fall more into animal

3013.76 --> 3016.8
like behavior

3016.88 --> 3027.839
in that sense i think you're right

3030.48 --> 3033.68
oh matthew eastman are there live

3032.24 --> 3037.52
broadcasts uh

3033.68 --> 3041.5989999999997
not really discord is usually

3037.52 --> 3044.0
used as an interface system

3041.599 --> 3044.88
and then people go live on youtube or

3044.0 --> 3048.319
some other

3044.88 --> 3049.6800000000003
thing like the live or any of those

3048.319 --> 3053.04
platforms

3049.68 --> 3056.96
to stream it on now you can

3053.04 --> 3060.319
technically stream

3056.96 --> 3063.839
in discord but it doesn't have its own

3060.319 --> 3065.68
platform a video platform of discord

3063.839 --> 3066.48
that doesn't exist so it's always going

3065.68 --> 3070.319
to have to

3066.48 --> 3070.96
use some kind of other video platform to

3070.319 --> 3083.839
stream

3070.96 --> 3083.839
towards if you do that

3085.92 --> 3091.04
there is no light without darkness no

3088.24 --> 3091.04
it's not true

3092.48 --> 3099.52
but one learns to appreciate

3096.48 --> 3102.079
the light a lot more when they've seen

3099.52 --> 3102.079
darkness

3109.839 --> 3113.359
yeah light makes shadow shadows don't

3111.839 --> 3117.2799999999997
make light

3113.359 --> 3121.2799999999997
but the shadows do make the light

3117.28 --> 3124.3190000000004
stand out right if everything is pure

3121.28 --> 3124.96
white light then it wouldn't mean

3124.319 --> 3127.92
anything

3124.96 --> 3127.92
there's no shapes

3128.48 --> 3135.2
there's less grasp for the consciousness

3133.359 --> 3137.119
and now if there's shadows there's some

3135.2 --> 3138.64
objects and physical thing in the way of

3137.119 --> 3142.1600000000003
the light in the shadow then

3138.64 --> 3153.839
suddenly you start to see what is there

3142.16 --> 3153.839
because of the shadow

3159.76 --> 3166.3190000000004
yes contrast i agree to that that's how

3163.119 --> 3170.48
i try to explain it

3166.319 --> 3173.04
this is very esoteric today sheesh

3170.48 --> 3173.04
that's fine

3173.52 --> 3181.839
it's in the air i guess

3183.52 --> 3185.92
okay

3193.52 --> 3197.28
what causes the earth to heat up

3199.68 --> 3202.0
uh

3202.88 --> 3210.0
mo mostly light associated with the

3207.28 --> 3211.52
sun luminary being absorbed at ground

3210.0 --> 3215.119
level

3211.52 --> 3217.839
matter absorbing that energy that's

3215.119 --> 3219.599
what causes well that has the most

3217.839 --> 3222.96
palpable influence heat

3219.599 --> 3224.079
heat wise so because it goes away again

3222.96 --> 3226.4
every time

3224.079 --> 3228.319
so that that's why it stands out that

3226.4 --> 3228.96
hey yeah there is energy when there's

3228.319 --> 3233.2
the sun

3228.96 --> 3237.839
and oh there's no energy it goes away

3233.2 --> 3237.839
when the sun is gone

3262.44 --> 3266.48
pre-incarnate christ what

3267.359 --> 3274.72
cool stuff okay sounds kind of

3271.68 --> 3274.72
sci-fi to me

3275.44 --> 3279.839
but whatever

3287.119 --> 3291.359
it's like if you're going to be literal

3289.119 --> 3292.96
about that oh a

3291.359 --> 3295.68
of christ yeah then you're literally

3292.96 --> 3298.7200000000003
breaking the code

3295.68 --> 3303.359
if you'd say okay well christ said

3298.72 --> 3307.7599999999998
people would come that would surpass him

3303.359 --> 3311.7599999999998
right now once you accept that statement

3307.76 --> 3312.7200000000003
then you realize wait maybe it's not so

3311.76 --> 3315.76
much

3312.72 --> 3317.2799999999997
about the flesh and blood it's about the

3315.76 --> 3320.6400000000003
spirit of what he's doing

3317.28 --> 3321.76
the method the path and then yeah well

3320.64 --> 3325.52
by that standard

3321.76 --> 3328.6400000000003
probably he could have been preceded

3325.52 --> 3332.24
by people with a similar

3328.64 --> 3335.359
choices similar abilities and

3332.24 --> 3339.4399999999996
afterward more

3335.359 --> 3341.04
right we could be part of it right now

3339.44 --> 3342.88
he's literally talking about that

3341.04 --> 3343.359
constantly it's like yeah you can do

3342.88 --> 3345.599
this

3343.359 --> 3347.52
you can literally do this any moment you

3345.599 --> 3348.0
just have to choose it you just have to

3347.52 --> 3352.96
realize

3348.0 --> 3352.96
that you can choose it and then

3353.119 --> 3358.4
pick up the fight

3356.24 --> 3361.2799999999997
and the fight is mostly going to be with

3358.4 --> 3364.1600000000003
your own ego

3361.28 --> 3367.599
that you can never defeat you can never

3364.16 --> 3367.5989999999997
completely defeat him

3371.68 --> 3374.96
or maybe christ didn't say that part

3373.68 --> 3378.0789999999997
that's maybe i

3374.96 --> 3380.4
added that on i'm not sure i don't know

3378.079 --> 3381.52
if christ really addressed like the ego

3380.4 --> 3391.839
spirit

3381.52 --> 3391.839
did he i'm not sure

3400.96 --> 3419.839
he probably should have in ways

3404.799 --> 3419.839
oh god who's here hello mark smiley here

3431.119 --> 3435.92
yeah i agree and he's he's literally

3434.16 --> 3447.68
trying to gas like me so yeah mark

3435.92 --> 3449.359
smiley you can [ __ ] off

3447.68 --> 3451.52
you have some dark crawlers in your

3449.359 --> 3454.64
buddy and

3451.52 --> 3455.7599999999998
yeah you can listen all you like and you

3454.64 --> 3458.16
can have your own

3455.76 --> 3460.7200000000003
impulse responses and how you're trying

3458.16 --> 3462.319
to rearrange things in order to satisfy

3460.72 --> 3465.1189999999997
your own ego

3462.319 --> 3466.4
i don't want to hear about it anymore

3465.119 --> 3470.4
okay

3466.4 --> 3475.119
i'm not your verbal garbage disposal

3470.4 --> 3488.78
you understand mark's my leader

3475.119 --> 3491.9190000000003
done with it

3488.78 --> 3491.9190000000003
[Music]

3500.839 --> 3503.839
ah

3510.48 --> 3514.16
what matthew eastman what are you saying

3514.319 --> 3521.2799999999997
michael the archangel they made

3517.68 --> 3525.2799999999997
he may or may not be the same person

3521.28 --> 3527.28
dude that's

3525.28 --> 3528.96
that's heavy stuff i don't know man i

3527.28 --> 3532.88
don't know matthew eastman

3528.96 --> 3534.96
look in my opinion if christ really was

3532.88 --> 3538.0
and he is that's not even a question if

3534.96 --> 3541.119
christ was a prophet

3538.0 --> 3541.68
right by by most religious standard it's

3541.119 --> 3544.88
just

3541.68 --> 3547.7599999999998
he is but

3544.88 --> 3549.599
who knows he literally might have had

3547.76 --> 3553.599
basically a whole

3549.599 --> 3558.2400000000002
the archangels with him at all times

3553.599 --> 3561.44
when he was alive this might be true

3558.24 --> 3564.8799999999997
and even being the

3561.44 --> 3567.44
the medium for them perhaps

3564.88 --> 3569.119
in some way but yeah that's going to be

3567.44 --> 3570.079
complicated to address that because

3569.119 --> 3573.52
there's going to be

3570.079 --> 3574.0
a giant amount of exoterra christians

3573.52 --> 3576.079
that are

3574.0 --> 3577.119
immediately going to get in the way of

3576.079 --> 3578.96
that

3577.119 --> 3582.6400000000003
and say it's blasphemous and ooh

3578.96 --> 3582.64
possession and blah blah whatever

3583.92 --> 3587.839
i wouldn't be surprised if he if he

3586.96 --> 3591.92
keeps on saying

3587.839 --> 3594.799
if he if he was no he is

3591.92 --> 3596.96
who he is i would not be surprised if he

3594.799 --> 3601.839
just had the archangels

3596.96 --> 3601.839
right there with him all the time

3627.89 --> 3632.14
[Music]

3650.96 --> 3654.11
[Music]

3654.839 --> 3657.839
um

3666.99 --> 3672.0899999999997
[Music]

3675.77 --> 3679.07
[Music]

3682.839 --> 3687.359
huh

3684.24 --> 3689.1189999999997
yeah i just thought of this title i

3687.359 --> 3698.5589999999997
don't know what you guys think of it

3689.119 --> 3701.599
but that's what i'm gonna call it

3698.559 --> 3704.6400000000003
because i would have to really

3701.599 --> 3707.599
study the bible where that

3704.64 --> 3709.2799999999997
i i should you know i might need some

3707.599 --> 3711.04
help some pointers because if i

3709.28 --> 3714.799
literally have to read through the whole

3711.04 --> 3714.799
thing i would never manage to find it

3715.359 --> 3720.64
but it would be interesting to study

3717.28 --> 3724.96
that part where jesus actually said

3720.64 --> 3727.839
that others will surpass him i would

3724.96 --> 3729.2
like to study the specific words as they

3727.839 --> 3733.599
were put and even

3729.2 --> 3735.9199999999996
if necessary the original greek

3733.599 --> 3738.6400000000003
and how it was translated in order to be

3735.92 --> 3740.64
extremely precise with this

3738.64 --> 3742.799
to really understand the vast

3740.64 --> 3746.72
implication because so far

3742.799 --> 3746.72
that part stood out to me so much

3747.2 --> 3754.48
like it really caught my attention and

3750.24 --> 3756.5589999999997
i need to be more sure more careful

3754.48 --> 3758.72
if i'm going to put all that weight on

3756.559 --> 3758.7200000000003
it

3759.52 --> 3769.839
to be sure of what it really means

3762.559 --> 3769.8390000000004
what it is

3790.48 --> 3793.839
what enlightened beings ascended master

3792.559 --> 3797.039
have the potential to

3793.839 --> 3800.0
be angels is that

3797.039 --> 3801.92
colloquial being angels there foul on

3800.0 --> 3805.599
buchanan

3801.92 --> 3807.839
because angels are separate spirits

3805.599 --> 3807.839
right

3809.28 --> 3815.52
people born

3812.319 --> 3819.839
people don't become

3815.52 --> 3819.839
or transform into angels

3820.559 --> 3823.76
whatever happens to them after death

3822.88 --> 3826.48
it's up to

3823.76 --> 3826.48
up to god

3827.52 --> 3833.7599999999998
but you don't transform into an angel

3830.96 --> 3834.48
during lifetime that makes no sense it's

3833.76 --> 3839.8390000000004
a totally

3834.48 --> 3839.839
it's a separate type of spirit

3858.559 --> 3864.799
so yeah if you mean colloquial angels

3861.839 --> 3865.359
like being like angels the colloquial

3864.799 --> 3868.72
version

3865.359 --> 3870.16
sure if you're going to get literal and

3868.72 --> 3873.359
actually point that

3870.16 --> 3877.2
yeah design creation based

3873.359 --> 3881.839
entities the angels then

3877.2 --> 3881.839
i think you're mistaken

3896.96 --> 3901.28
so why reference adam as archangel

3899.52 --> 3904.4
michael after his death

3901.28 --> 3906.48
because it's after his death that's just

3904.4 --> 3910.7200000000003
what it just pointed at

3906.48 --> 3910.72
it's up to god after death

3913.68 --> 3918.16
but that doesn't happen during life

3919.44 --> 3923.119
because when you're alive you're bound

3921.76 --> 3925.28
to the body

3923.119 --> 3927.2000000000003
and the ego that comes with it to

3925.28 --> 3937.8390000000004
counter balance it

3927.2 --> 3937.839
so it can't be

3948.839 --> 3953.599
hmm well i like that faul lambo cannon

3951.839 --> 3954.96
what you just said there angels are the

3953.599 --> 3958.0
army of god

3954.96 --> 3961.44
though use capital letter g

3958.0 --> 3962.88
okay that otherwise you're making a

3961.44 --> 3965.68
mistake

3962.88 --> 3966.4
they are sometimes defeated by satan in

3965.68 --> 3969.5989999999997
the war

3966.4 --> 3972.7200000000003
with him and his demons

3969.599 --> 3975.3590000000004
yeah may be defeated in a moment not

3972.72 --> 3977.68
really defeated forever though angels

3975.359 --> 3980.4
are replenished by enlightened masters

3977.68 --> 3982.5589999999997
and ascended masters uh

3980.4 --> 3983.6800000000003
replenished what are you saying that

3982.559 --> 3986.96
they spawn

3983.68 --> 3990.8799999999997
new angels this is weird man

3986.96 --> 3993.119
you're making it kind of literal now

3990.88 --> 3994.4
like an extra dimensional fight with

3993.119 --> 3997.92
casualties

3994.4 --> 3997.92
i don't see it like that at all

3998.48 --> 4006.72
i don't think angels

4001.839 --> 4010.4
can ever die like

4006.72 --> 4013.7599999999998
they're not living anymore

4010.4 --> 4013.76
they can't really die

4014.64 --> 4022.4
they just recede back to god

4018.4 --> 4025.119
until the right frequency is called

4022.4 --> 4034.0
is brought forth in order for it to

4025.119 --> 4036.6400000000003
manifest again that's how i see it

4034.0 --> 4037.44
why would god need an army well because

4036.64 --> 4039.7599999999998
there's men

4037.44 --> 4041.599
that really like to see god having an

4039.76 --> 4043.6800000000003
army and then being a soldier of that

4041.599 --> 4046.88
they just like to fantasize that

4043.68 --> 4047.44
a lot and that's why they typically say

4046.88 --> 4063.839
that

4047.44 --> 4063.839
see me traveler

4103.279 --> 4108.4800000000005
yeah clutch bear i know what you mean i

4104.88 --> 4108.4800000000005
got i got that for a while

4109.44 --> 4113.12
and it's weird because it really does

4111.12 --> 4113.599999999999
matter even if you don't believe any of

4113.12 --> 4115.839
it

4113.6 --> 4117.52
like it literally matters for some

4115.839 --> 4120.5599999999995
reason it has a lot of

4117.52 --> 4124.2390000000005
impact whether you do that or not

4120.56 --> 4126.159000000001
whether you're conscious of it or not

4124.239 --> 4128.239
it's just what i picked up on that's why

4126.159 --> 4131.44
i take that very serious now

4128.239 --> 4131.44
and have for some time

4131.759 --> 4136.88
like the only time i did not take that

4134.159 --> 4139.839
series is when i was just

4136.88 --> 4140.4800000000005
atheist like an atheist spiritualist as

4139.839 --> 4143.5199999999995
in

4140.48 --> 4145.5199999999995
like i am i don't believe any of that

4143.52 --> 4147.1990000000005
because all the people that believe that

4145.52 --> 4148.56
are stupid and they don't know what

4147.199 --> 4149.3589999999995
they're talking about and i was right

4148.56 --> 4152.88
about that

4149.359 --> 4152.88
right but

4153.04 --> 4160.799
then in my personal mission now i'm

4155.279 --> 4162.719
talking like 20 years ago and more

4160.799 --> 4164.799
i was just kind of like scientifically

4162.719 --> 4165.12
trying to test it all it's like oh yeah

4164.799 --> 4166.96
oh

4165.12 --> 4168.719
we got all this oh the people are

4166.96 --> 4171.52
completely mocking it up

4168.719 --> 4175.04
like they literally are making a giant

4171.52 --> 4178.319
shitty mess out of it like corruption at

4175.04 --> 4180.56
every corner and they don't even know it

4178.319 --> 4181.4400000000005
that was my issue back then so i was

4180.56 --> 4185.279
like okay let's

4181.44 --> 4188.239
test it how do i test it

4185.279 --> 4190.719
how do i test any of this is real well

4188.239 --> 4192.159
and then a lot of [ __ ] started to unfold

4190.719 --> 4195.52
and now i'm right here

4192.159 --> 4200.879999999999
and yeah i've done my tests

4195.52 --> 4204.400000000001
it's real it's just that

4200.88 --> 4206.56
most people have problems

4204.4 --> 4208.32
trying to understand what that really

4206.56 --> 4213.360000000001
implies

4208.32 --> 4216.0
and what it being real really means

4213.36 --> 4217.28
right because everybody has their own

4216.0 --> 4219.92
approach and then they

4217.28 --> 4220.96
stick within their conscience in a very

4219.92 --> 4223.1990000000005
specific level

4220.96 --> 4224.32
of dynamics like social interaction

4223.199 --> 4226.639999999999
dynamics or

4224.32 --> 4228.799999999999
perception dynamics and they stick to

4226.64 --> 4229.76
that and then they also translate things

4228.8 --> 4232.64
from the bible

4229.76 --> 4233.52
and the creation story through their

4232.64 --> 4235.84
specific

4233.52 --> 4235.84
level

4236.56 --> 4239.6
but it is really just a personal

4238.159 --> 4243.199
interpretation

4239.6 --> 4246.4800000000005
and they added they are still dwelling

4243.199 --> 4258.48
on the other levels that they don't

4246.48 --> 4261.599999999999
touch upon because of that

4258.48 --> 4265.919999999999
this only full understanding actually is

4261.6 --> 4269.4400000000005
that's why i see it it's like god

4265.92 --> 4272.4800000000005
is truth truth

4269.44 --> 4275.678999999999
is only

4272.48 --> 4280.239
is only you can only get a grip on it

4275.679 --> 4280.2390000000005
if you know

4280.8 --> 4286.2390000000005
knowing is god but

4283.92 --> 4288.2390000000005
yeah the consequences and the challenge

4286.239 --> 4292.0
and we are a person here in

4288.239 --> 4294.879999999999
life so we will face the challenges that

4292.0 --> 4294.88
come with knowing

4295.52 --> 4298.56
what does it do with you what's the

4297.12 --> 4300.96
choice that's going to be

4298.56 --> 4302.0
it's not going to be a good choice or a

4300.96 --> 4304.96
nice choice

4302.0 --> 4305.44
most of the time the more you learn the

4304.96 --> 4308.8
more

4305.44 --> 4315.839999999999
grip you gain on inside itself

4308.8 --> 4315.84
the more punishing things become

4315.92 --> 4320.0
but not without rewards though you know

4318.719 --> 4323.76
the reward

4320.0 --> 4328.96
yield becomes equal and opposite

4323.76 --> 4331.4400000000005
to the punishment

4328.96 --> 4333.52
unless you discard it unless you reject

4331.44 --> 4335.919999999999
it unless you actually don't want to

4333.52 --> 4338.8
attain that peak

4335.92 --> 4340.56
within your growth and actually are

4338.8 --> 4344.719
looking for an excuse to drop

4340.56 --> 4344.719
down again to lessen the tension

4346.88 --> 4350.2390000000005
because it's very tough to know and to

4349.76 --> 4354.159000000001
live

4350.239 --> 4356.5599999999995
by knowledge to actually live it

4354.159 --> 4357.679
and draw in all the consequences that

4356.56 --> 4360.320000000001
come with it

4357.679 --> 4361.76
in reflection of those that do not live

4360.32 --> 4364.799999999999
by it

4361.76 --> 4367.52
that actually pretend to have it but

4364.8 --> 4367.52
reject it

4367.76 --> 4371.360000000001
and the more you learn the more you see

4369.92 --> 4374.32
the more you realize

4371.36 --> 4374.799999999999
how many people are caught up in their

4374.32 --> 4377.199
own

4374.8 --> 4377.1990000000005
level

4379.04 --> 4383.12
and they get used to that level and even

4380.88 --> 4386.400000000001
people start to expect

4383.12 --> 4387.36
that level from them even though it

4386.4 --> 4389.36
might keep them

4387.36 --> 4390.4
in a certain spot and prevent them from

4389.36 --> 4399.839999999999
developing

4390.4 --> 4399.839999999999
and these are all natural mechanisms

4400.56 --> 4403.4400000000005
hey adam beacon

4409.12 --> 4412.239
the more you define natural law the more

4411.28 --> 4414.48
he was

4412.239 --> 4416.959999999999
the thing about natural law mother eyes

4414.48 --> 4416.959999999999
i take it

4417.679 --> 4420.8
are you referring to

4421.76 --> 4428.719
physics or are you referring to

4425.52 --> 4432.159000000001
god's spiritual law for the conduct

4428.719 --> 4434.0
of life two different things if you mean

4432.159 --> 4436.159
natural law physics then yeah

4434.0 --> 4437.679
you can't define natural law that's the

4436.159 --> 4440.0
point

4437.679 --> 4441.92
it's a paradox you can't define natural

4440.0 --> 4444.159
law if you could it wouldn't be natural

4441.92 --> 4444.159
law

4447.6 --> 4453.04
natural law are laws

4450.8 --> 4454.88
that cannot be broken that's why they're

4453.04 --> 4458.239
natural law

4454.88 --> 4458.2390000000005
but that's physics though

4464.8 --> 4475.52
oh man holy [ __ ] did time fly again

4470.4 --> 4475.5199999999995
it did again didn't it it's dude

4476.32 --> 4479.92
that's incredible i'm gonna take a

4478.48 --> 4481.759999999999
toilet break though but maybe i'm gonna

4479.92 --> 4482.2390000000005
do a two-hour show today as well who

4481.76 --> 4487.52
knows

4482.239 --> 4487.5199999999995
i'm in a good flow so be back in two

4494.84 --> 4497.84
minutes

4564.84 --> 4567.84
so

4578.84 --> 4581.84
ugh

4605.44 --> 4609.28
not interested in advertisement for

4608.08 --> 4612.32
prank curve

4609.28 --> 4612.32
channels thanks

4616.57 --> 4620.21
[Music]

4620.239 --> 4637.839999999999
george stanford we heard yeah

4623.6 --> 4637.84
don't care

4647.84 --> 4654.4800000000005
yes my thighs me too

4651.04 --> 4654.48
i don't celebrate easter

4657.199 --> 4663.04
but in um yeah in another way

4660.48 --> 4664.48
i guess that if i would have kids little

4663.04 --> 4666.719
kids especially

4664.48 --> 4669.199
then i would probably celebrate it with

4666.719 --> 4672.08
them because when i was a little kid i

4669.199 --> 4675.5199999999995
really enjoyed easter with my family it

4672.08 --> 4678.96
was like a special thing where like even

4675.52 --> 4680.719
like my aunt and nephews and all that

4678.96 --> 4682.08
that we would all come together and

4680.719 --> 4686.4800000000005
grandma

4682.08 --> 4688.64
for that and it was a lot of fun

4686.48 --> 4690.159
basically it is i guess the bigger if

4688.64 --> 4692.96
you have a big family

4690.159 --> 4694.639999999999
celebrating easter is just a lot of fun

4692.96 --> 4696.719
and it's a nice experience

4694.64 --> 4699.280000000001
i wouldn't want to deprive kids of that

4696.719 --> 4699.28
experience

4700.159 --> 4703.28
but when it comes to spiritual things i

4702.88 --> 4707.84
would

4703.28 --> 4707.84
kind of like stay away from

4708.88 --> 4713.1990000000005
celebrating presupposed births of pagan

4712.08 --> 4721.84
gods and all that

4713.199 --> 4721.839999999999
i would stay away from that

4754.88 --> 4759.679
with clutter there's nothing bad about

4756.96 --> 4762.56
doing the egg thing

4759.679 --> 4763.84
i don't see that as bad happy new year

4762.56 --> 4767.76
then

4763.84 --> 4767.76
no adam that's all fine

4768.159 --> 4773.44
what happy new year why you say that

4770.0 --> 4773.44
anyway it's not a new year

4775.44 --> 4777.839999999999
weird

4793.44 --> 4805.839999999999
all right

4816.88 --> 4823.04
yeah okay adam if you say so

4831.12 --> 4836.08
how long must we suffer the roman

4832.96 --> 4836.08
catholic and i don't know

4836.159 --> 4841.04
but i'm very much for a rearrangement of

4838.88 --> 4845.04
the calendar and just turning it

4841.04 --> 4849.28
making 13 months that would be

4845.04 --> 4852.8
more logical like a lot more logical

4849.28 --> 4855.28
just 13 months done that simple

4852.8 --> 4858.08
like you don't even have to change

4855.28 --> 4858.08
anything else

4859.6 --> 4875.84
13 months 28 days done

4896.719 --> 4900.639
oh by the way i said that 20 years ago

4900.08 --> 4904.719
too

4900.639 --> 4916.8
like yeah year should have 13 months

4904.719 --> 4919.04
just done get it over with

4916.8 --> 4922.08
[Music]

4919.04 --> 4925.199
for some reason it was also a part in my

4922.08 --> 4925.199
vision experience

4925.92 --> 4930.4800000000005
but yeah it's weird how i remember some

4929.76 --> 4932.96
things

4930.48 --> 4934.08
through my visions rather than through

4932.96 --> 4936.56
the physical

4934.08 --> 4939.36
experience in the real in the yeah in

4936.56 --> 4939.360000000001
the normal world

4940.08 --> 4945.84
i don't know why that is

4950.8 --> 4956.400000000001
on the other hand maybe i could actually

4953.92 --> 4959.76
explain why that is

4956.4 --> 4961.36
20 years a suggestion like this would be

4959.76 --> 4964.3
born from

4961.36 --> 4965.839999999999
just honesty and perfection and truth

4964.3 --> 4969.1990000000005
[Music]

4965.84 --> 4972.2390000000005
in a time where was unable to

4969.199 --> 4974.879999999999
even express that

4972.239 --> 4976.5599999999995
really to most people because everybody

4974.88 --> 4981.36
would oppose that

4976.56 --> 4981.360000000001
and it was more vulnerable

4981.84 --> 4988.639
so maybe then that realization

4986.159 --> 4990.48
started reflecting itself in the dark

4988.639 --> 4993.84
world experience

4990.48 --> 4997.759999999999
as an emergency escape experience

4993.84 --> 5000.56
maybe to impress me more

4997.76 --> 5002.56
than in the physical world experience

5000.56 --> 5004.96
where i could do nothing with it

5002.56 --> 5008.639
so that it would impress me more for the

5004.96 --> 5012.0
long run and stick to mind

5008.639 --> 5015.84
yeah there's a psychological mystery

5012.0 --> 5015.84
right there

5016.08 --> 5020.08
because maybe that is what happens to

5018.56 --> 5021.76
some people at least

5020.08 --> 5024.8
when they have all kinds of things

5021.76 --> 5027.12
inside them that they just cannot

5024.8 --> 5029.4400000000005
connect to the outside world and other

5027.12 --> 5031.679
people properly

5029.44 --> 5033.678999999999
or they're too afraid to and then it

5031.679 --> 5042.82
just starts to reflect in their dreams

5033.679 --> 5044.56
and who knows what happens with that

5042.82 --> 5048.799999999999
[Music]

5044.56 --> 5048.8
is a good teacher for sky clock sure

5050.32 --> 5053.44
he's certainly going to be better at it

5051.92 --> 5056.96
than i am

5053.44 --> 5058.159
you know i am not i am not too much

5056.96 --> 5061.28
about astrology

5058.159 --> 5061.28
i really am not

5061.52 --> 5068.4800000000005
i'm purely about mechanics

5064.96 --> 5071.04
descriptions trying to describe

5068.48 --> 5072.159
that which nobody has ever coherently

5071.04 --> 5075.12
described only

5072.159 --> 5076.638999999999
improvisingly i'm really trying to build

5075.12 --> 5079.12
this a framework for

5076.639 --> 5079.92
understanding how to deal with ethereal

5079.12 --> 5083.679
things

5079.92 --> 5086.56
how to basically solidify them to myself

5083.679 --> 5087.04
and other people so that it doesn't have

5086.56 --> 5090.159000000001
to be

5087.04 --> 5091.5199999999995
all random and woozy and mysterious but

5090.159 --> 5095.759999999999
you can actually

5091.52 --> 5098.2390000000005
trust on the mechanics of it

5095.76 --> 5100.639
because you understand it and that's a

5098.239 --> 5104.48
big part of what i do

5100.639 --> 5107.92
in general but also on the show

5104.48 --> 5110.239
and you the ethereal mechanisms of

5107.92 --> 5110.2390000000005
things

5110.88 --> 5115.6
so when they present themselves to you

5113.44 --> 5117.919999999999
when situations that involve

5115.6 --> 5118.96
those mechanisms present themselves to

5117.92 --> 5122.4800000000005
you

5118.96 --> 5126.4
you will have a memory a feeling

5122.48 --> 5129.678999999999
a frequency in your memory to actually

5126.4 --> 5131.599999999999
engage like as if you were always able

5129.679 --> 5133.28
to

5131.6 --> 5134.639
that's typically what the spirit

5133.28 --> 5141.679
mechanisms can

5134.639 --> 5143.6
provide you with

5141.679 --> 5145.1990000000005
all right you like crow triple seven

5143.6 --> 5154.88
stuff oh that's fine look

5145.199 --> 5157.199
he has a lot of fans and i get it

5154.88 --> 5157.1990000000005
me

5159.28 --> 5164.4
maybe it's an ego thing

5162.48 --> 5166.4
because i have a lot when i hear them i

5164.4 --> 5168.5599999999995
have a lot of tendencies to get

5166.4 --> 5170.4
a bit safany and just start correcting

5168.56 --> 5171.84
him like no no you were not specific

5170.4 --> 5172.5599999999995
enough about that no no you're over

5171.84 --> 5176.400000000001
generalized

5172.56 --> 5176.400000000001
i'm i get like that

5176.639 --> 5181.52
when i see his streams so i for some

5179.76 --> 5185.52
reason

5181.52 --> 5187.360000000001
error seem to highlight themselves to me

5185.52 --> 5189.040000000001
when i watch him that's why i don't

5187.36 --> 5191.04
watch him too much

5189.04 --> 5194.08
but i hear a lot of praise from other

5191.04 --> 5194.08
people about him so

5208.84 --> 5211.84
right

5231.76 --> 5236.400000000001
have i considered yeah duh foul on

5234.159 --> 5238.0
buchanan what do you think

5236.4 --> 5240.239
what do you think is happening out there

5238.0 --> 5241.6
with just the entire western church

5240.239 --> 5244.638999999999
society

5241.6 --> 5245.1990000000005
it's cocktail to hell it's tolerant of

5244.639 --> 5247.679
that

5245.199 --> 5249.28
which should not be tolerated by the

5247.679 --> 5252.32
freaking bible itself

5249.28 --> 5254.719
yes it's blatantly obvious

5252.32 --> 5256.0
that satan's demons have worked their

5254.719 --> 5259.76
ways into

5256.0 --> 5263.12
christianity into the churches

5259.76 --> 5263.12
like new priesthoods

5263.84 --> 5269.360000000001
kind of what well the catholic church

5266.32 --> 5269.36
originally did

5276.239 --> 5295.839999999999
hello guns have never run rmp

5281.36 --> 5295.839999999999
who are you talking about

5300.48 --> 5306.08
yeah well flat on pulse look

5304.0 --> 5307.52
there's a lot of salvonias on the

5306.08 --> 5309.36
internet

5307.52 --> 5311.52
that call themselves christian because

5309.36 --> 5316.159
they know something and they read some

5311.52 --> 5318.2390000000005
things and and they just overlook

5316.159 --> 5319.199
that you shouldn't waste your time on

5318.239 --> 5321.199
doing that

5319.199 --> 5323.839999999999
just pointing fingers and accusing other

5321.199 --> 5323.839999999999
people

5325.92 --> 5330.639
when it's obvious they're not engaging

5328.32 --> 5333.36
in some dark ritual

5330.639 --> 5334.400000000001
even though the origins of it may be

5333.36 --> 5336.799999999999
dubious

5334.4 --> 5338.32
right because in the end it's the

5336.8 --> 5341.92
intention

5338.32 --> 5345.679
of the people that often

5341.92 --> 5351.84
triumphs over any dark origin

5345.679 --> 5351.84
right especially when they don't know

5356.32 --> 5359.12
trolls of course

5362.48 --> 5378.98
well there's not there's no trolls in

5364.32 --> 5382.98
here right now

5378.98 --> 5382.98
[Music]

5390.84 --> 5407.84
um

5392.159 --> 5407.839999999999
guns enter the chat well guns blazing

5408.8 --> 5412.96
so uh yeah are you all enjoying this

5411.12 --> 5416.08
show

5412.96 --> 5420.8
i'm having a good time it's already an

5416.08 --> 5422.719
ah and half an hour extra

5420.8 --> 5424.8
but i'm getting a little hungry though

5422.719 --> 5428.159
i'm really looking forward to

5424.8 --> 5428.159000000001
my baked egg lunch

5430.08 --> 5435.84
but as long as my tea is not running out

5433.199 --> 5435.839999999999
i'm fine

5441.44 --> 5445.678999999999
you like the title the sun and beyond

5443.6 --> 5448.400000000001
well too bad for you

5445.679 --> 5450.08
because this hangout is called jesus

5448.4 --> 5463.839999999999
christ

5450.08 --> 5463.84
and beyond yeah get over it

5476.239 --> 5479.759999999999
no george sanford jesus christ i'm not

5478.8 --> 5482.88
talking about

5479.76 --> 5487.1990000000005
the sun yeah i know that

5482.88 --> 5489.04
this story has celestial correlations

5487.199 --> 5491.44
as to the celestial says yeah yeah now

5489.04 --> 5495.199
the i know the gnostics yeah yeah

5491.44 --> 5498.48
that does not exclude

5495.199 --> 5499.12
the rest yeah just because you found a

5498.48 --> 5501.839999999999
little

5499.12 --> 5503.199
pattern in there that is celestial in

5501.84 --> 5505.76
origin and rhythm

5503.199 --> 5508.0
yeah that's very fascinating that's not

5505.76 --> 5508.639
the exclusive meeting and the rest is

5508.0 --> 5512.88
[ __ ]

5508.639 --> 5516.08
yeah that's wrong if you believe that

5512.88 --> 5517.36
you're an idiot and you don't understand

5516.08 --> 5519.159
the power

5517.36 --> 5521.199
of the freaking bible it's a

5519.159 --> 5524.5599999999995
multi-dimensional book

5521.199 --> 5528.799999999999
it means a lot of different things that

5524.56 --> 5533.0
might seem to contradict one another

5528.8 --> 5536.320000000001
they don't it means multiple things

5533.0 --> 5537.28
simultaneously and once you get the full

5536.32 --> 5540.48
oversight

5537.28 --> 5544.639
any seeming contrast will be

5540.48 --> 5548.239
resolved because you understand

5544.639 --> 5550.159000000001
why it seemed to contrast right

5548.239 --> 5552.48
so if you're gonna get stuck and oh

5550.159 --> 5554.159
jesus christ it's just a soda nothing is

5552.48 --> 5557.199
real so just metaphorical

5554.159 --> 5561.92
yo then you're an idiot

5557.199 --> 5563.919999999999
and you're basically denying christ

5561.92 --> 5566.56
and i don't care if that doesn't mean

5563.92 --> 5569.52
anything to you

5566.56 --> 5571.280000000001
if you're going to virtue signal that

5569.52 --> 5574.400000000001
[ __ ]

5571.28 --> 5575.199
i'm not i don't like christ don't use it

5574.4 --> 5576.638999999999
he's not real

5575.199 --> 5578.4
if you're gonna do that here i will

5576.639 --> 5580.2390000000005
eventually just kick you out you know

5578.4 --> 5580.719
you don't have to believe it you can be

5580.239 --> 5584.08
all

5580.719 --> 5588.08
pagan and [ __ ] as much as you like

5584.08 --> 5591.5199999999995
don't freaking diss christ because you

5588.08 --> 5591.5199999999995
don't know what the [ __ ] you're doing

5593.84 --> 5596.96
and i don't care about you may figure it

5596.08 --> 5599.04
out someday

5596.96 --> 5603.84
why don't you look in the mirror tell

5599.04 --> 5603.84
that to yourself

5604.8 --> 5611.679
it doesn't freaking matter whether

5607.92 --> 5616.32
things in religion personify the sun

5611.679 --> 5619.52
that does not exclude it being

5616.32 --> 5622.4
the other thing as well you don't know

5619.52 --> 5624.88
because you're over generalizing you

5622.4 --> 5627.759999999999
found a little pattern in the book

5624.88 --> 5628.400000000001
and then decided that's the only real

5627.76 --> 5631.52
thing about

5628.4 --> 5635.12
it and ignore the

5631.52 --> 5637.76
vast truth of energy

5635.12 --> 5638.5599999999995
and meaning and insight that is in the

5637.76 --> 5641.92
rest of it

5638.56 --> 5645.84
you're ignoring it you're being ignorant

5641.92 --> 5645.84
george sanford

5654.639 --> 5658.8
it doesn't matter yours it doesn't

5656.4 --> 5661.759999999999
matter whether it's copyrighted

5658.8 --> 5662.4800000000005
translated misinterpreted politicized

5661.76 --> 5665.360000000001
all of that

5662.48 --> 5666.638999999999
[ __ ] occulted all this occult [ __ ]

5665.36 --> 5668.48
dumped into it

5666.639 --> 5669.76
it doesn't matter the only thing that

5668.48 --> 5673.04
matters

5669.76 --> 5675.679
is what is in there and

5673.04 --> 5678.32
how do you reflect on that it's a test

5675.679 --> 5682.0
you read it it's a test

5678.32 --> 5682.799999999999
the test is what are you responding to

5682.0 --> 5685.679
and how

5682.8 --> 5687.92
what does this do to you do you realize

5685.679 --> 5692.639
what is real and not

5687.92 --> 5692.639
do you have the sensibility

5693.04 --> 5696.4
that's what it's all about and you

5694.96 --> 5699.119
clearly

5696.4 --> 5701.839999999999
don't or you wouldn't be having this

5699.119 --> 5701.839999999999
attitude here

5722.08 --> 5728.639
yeah yeah there definitely is a

5724.08 --> 5732.48
historical figure

5728.639 --> 5735.92
but to me it doesn't even matter anymore

5732.48 --> 5737.5199999999995
none of it matters it doesn't matter

5735.92 --> 5739.1990000000005
whether it's real or it's completely

5737.52 --> 5742.56
conjured up what matters is

5739.199 --> 5745.759999999999
what it does to you

5742.56 --> 5747.1990000000005
there is some serious essence in the

5745.76 --> 5750.08
bible

5747.199 --> 5750.96
and they can't get it out they can only

5750.08 --> 5753.28
try to

5750.96 --> 5754.0
make it more appealing for you to find

5753.28 --> 5758.32
an escape

5754.0 --> 5760.56
or to dwell on ego based desires

5758.32 --> 5761.759999999999
within their interpretation that's all

5760.56 --> 5764.320000000001
that man can do

5761.76 --> 5765.92
if they take away the true essence it's

5764.32 --> 5769.44
just gonna

5765.92 --> 5773.04
collapse in on itself they can't do it

5769.44 --> 5776.5599999999995
they can't mutilate the book

5773.04 --> 5776.56
they can't do it

5777.119 --> 5780.48
even if they technically can they can't

5779.92 --> 5783.76
do it

5780.48 --> 5785.678999999999
because then the power would be lost

5783.76 --> 5788.2390000000005
and then everything collapses in on

5785.679 --> 5789.52
itself about it especially them the ones

5788.239 --> 5792.718999999999
that are trying to

5789.52 --> 5795.360000000001
do that right the controllers the

5792.719 --> 5797.6
wielders it will collapse in on itself

5795.36 --> 5799.28
so yeah they can tinker with it they can

5797.6 --> 5802.96
do their magic

5799.28 --> 5805.759999999999
tricks all over the place they can't

5802.96 --> 5806.32
really change it though the essence of

5805.76 --> 5808.719
it

5806.32 --> 5810.239
where it really comes from they can only

5808.719 --> 5814.88
convolute it

5810.239 --> 5817.159
all these details you gotta realize that

5814.88 --> 5819.1990000000005
step away from these stupid

5817.159 --> 5821.839999999999
oversimplified assertions

5819.199 --> 5823.919999999999
it's all wrong because somebody did

5821.84 --> 5826.56
something for a political reason

5823.92 --> 5828.159
or they edited it or they mistranslated

5826.56 --> 5830.2390000000005
it on purpose or

5828.159 --> 5831.759999999999
certain things were excluded yet that's

5830.239 --> 5835.44
all whiny

5831.76 --> 5838.0
excuses that point that you don't

5835.44 --> 5840.719
understand it at all you don't

5838.0 --> 5844.32
understand what the bible is

5840.719 --> 5847.28
what is in there what the essence is

5844.32 --> 5847.679
why it's there what its function is you

5847.28 --> 5850.08
don't

5847.679 --> 5855.84
understand any of it based on what

5850.08 --> 5855.84
you're saying

5861.52 --> 5866.639
is it possible that jesus was one of the

5863.52 --> 5866.639
giant people no

5866.84 --> 5871.84
or well

5869.84 --> 5875.52
that's a big now but he didn't he just

5871.84 --> 5877.360000000001
no no it makes no sense

5875.52 --> 5880.84
the wh where where where did he come

5877.36 --> 5883.839999999999
from then how did he

5880.84 --> 5883.84
no

5887.76 --> 5897.84
that that's very far-fetched there

5891.04 --> 5897.84
steamy traveler

5943.36 --> 5950.799999999999
all right look

5947.28 --> 5954.4
i know one thing for sure for sure

5950.8 --> 5958.08
there's no way out of it there's no way

5954.4 --> 5961.599999999999
nowhere to escape nowhere

5958.08 --> 5964.48
if you reject jesus christ

5961.6 --> 5965.280000000001
for whatever the [ __ ] reason it doesn't

5964.48 --> 5968.239
matter

5965.28 --> 5968.239
you got a problem

5968.56 --> 5973.76
what do you do it emotionally

5970.84 --> 5976.32
intellectually

5973.76 --> 5978.639
doesn't matter when you do it you're

5976.32 --> 5978.639
gonna be

5978.84 --> 5983.92
[ __ ]

5980.48 --> 5986.879999999999
and it doesn't even matter why

5983.92 --> 5987.6
i'm not even gonna try to explain to you

5986.88 --> 5990.96
why

5987.6 --> 5994.08
i just know it is

5990.96 --> 5997.92
if you got a problem with jesus christ

5994.08 --> 5997.92
you got a big [ __ ] problem

5998.0 --> 6001.6
and you're probably going to defend

6000.0 --> 6004.48
against it hold on to it

6001.6 --> 6006.400000000001
and conjure up all kinds of excuses of

6004.48 --> 6008.239
how the people out there calling

6006.4 --> 6008.879999999999
themselves christian how you dislike

6008.239 --> 6011.199
what they do

6008.88 --> 6014.159000000001
why they do it it's all so bad it

6011.199 --> 6016.96
doesn't matter what [ __ ]

6014.159 --> 6018.32
book line of excuses millions and

6016.96 --> 6021.679
millions of pages

6018.32 --> 6025.28
detailed as to why you don't want to

6021.679 --> 6028.4800000000005
it doesn't matter right

6025.28 --> 6032.0
if you reject it you're [ __ ]

6028.48 --> 6035.119
it doesn't matter what your reasons are

6032.0 --> 6038.239
this is not about reason anymore

6035.119 --> 6038.239
it's about the essence

6042.4 --> 6051.839999999999
you do it to yourself

6052.719 --> 6058.159
and when i say that when you reject

6056.239 --> 6061.759999999999
jesus christ

6058.159 --> 6065.199
that's not referring to how priesthoods

6061.76 --> 6069.280000000001
over the ages have dealt with it

6065.199 --> 6069.28
and told people to do things

6069.679 --> 6073.84
right it's not about that it's nothing

6072.48 --> 6076.959999999999
about that

6073.84 --> 6078.159000000001
right all these ways that priests have

6076.96 --> 6081.36
manipulated

6078.159 --> 6084.638999999999
people into doing things into

6081.36 --> 6085.119
creating power shifts all that yeah

6084.639 --> 6089.4400000000005
that's

6085.119 --> 6089.44
literally not good

6091.04 --> 6095.04
but that's not what it's about if you

6093.28 --> 6099.28
have christ allergy

6095.04 --> 6101.679
you got a problem a big one

6099.28 --> 6102.5599999999995
you better damn well deal with it or you

6101.679 --> 6107.84
are going to

6102.56 --> 6107.84
have a big problem

6112.88 --> 6118.639
the problem is right at the center the

6115.92 --> 6118.639
center of it

6119.36 --> 6126.08
you can build up as many things as you

6122.0 --> 6126.08
like if you don't get it right you got a

6128.93 --> 6132.039000000001
[Music]

6132.84 --> 6135.84
problem

6155.52 --> 6160.2390000000005
well guns have never owned our mp are

6157.84 --> 6164.56
you too sure about that

6160.239 --> 6167.04
i think both of you and myself included

6164.56 --> 6169.1990000000005
do we still have blind spots everybody

6167.04 --> 6171.119
has

6169.199 --> 6172.879999999999
certain reaches in where they can

6171.119 --> 6177.119
identify errors

6172.88 --> 6179.119
and lies and traps

6177.119 --> 6182.239
one can do it a little better in a very

6179.119 --> 6184.32
specific region than in other regions

6182.239 --> 6186.879999999999
and other people can do it in their

6184.32 --> 6186.88
regions

6187.36 --> 6194.0
but yeah i think that george is really

6191.119 --> 6194.0
just mistaken

6197.28 --> 6206.0
it's just he's just

6200.8 --> 6206.0
showing christ allergy you can't deny it

6208.4 --> 6213.04
and doesn't matter the reason i used to

6210.8 --> 6213.52
have christ allergy okay i used to have

6213.04 --> 6216.48
it

6213.52 --> 6218.320000000001
exactly like this [ __ ] oh and i build

6216.48 --> 6219.599999999999
all these mechanisms all these

6218.32 --> 6222.0
accountability

6219.6 --> 6222.639
all the reasons it doesn't [ __ ]

6222.0 --> 6227.84
matter

6222.639 --> 6227.84
it doesn't matter it's all

6230.84 --> 6233.84
wasted

6275.92 --> 6284.4800000000005
right christopher newton well that's

6279.6 --> 6286.4800000000005
well calling it fallen we have flaws

6284.48 --> 6289.119
the this part of the ego it's part of

6286.48 --> 6292.879999999999
the condition of our existence

6289.119 --> 6295.92
but also look if you're all in tune with

6292.88 --> 6299.28
christ just i'm just gonna say christ

6295.92 --> 6303.92
okay just gonna say

6299.28 --> 6307.44
christ christ christ jesus christ

6303.92 --> 6311.679
savior prophet jesus christ

6307.44 --> 6314.799999999999
died for our sins that one yeah

6311.679 --> 6317.28
if you're in tune

6314.8 --> 6319.52
and you spot your flaws you size up your

6317.28 --> 6324.32
talents and your flaws

6319.52 --> 6327.360000000001
yeah it's actually really

6324.32 --> 6328.32
really handy to be in that position and

6327.36 --> 6330.88
just

6328.32 --> 6333.5199999999995
use each other's flaws and talents

6330.88 --> 6335.84
ranges and it's much easier to even size

6333.52 --> 6335.84
it up

6336.32 --> 6342.84
you can use somebody's talents just by

6339.52 --> 6344.080000000001
having them present and respond to

6342.84 --> 6347.119000000001
things

6344.08 --> 6350.4
it's like sensor readouts

6347.119 --> 6350.4
if you're going to get mechanical

6350.48 --> 6353.759999999999
and it works it works really well but it

6353.119 --> 6356.239
only

6353.76 --> 6356.2390000000005
works

6357.76 --> 6364.56
if you sign on to jesus christ

6361.36 --> 6365.679
sounds really churchian right when i say

6364.56 --> 6369.4400000000005
that

6365.679 --> 6371.4400000000005
well that's because of just the

6369.44 --> 6374.159
influence of the word the way it has

6371.44 --> 6376.638999999999
been used handled

6374.159 --> 6378.48
used as a manipulation device over the

6376.639 --> 6382.08
ages and that sticks

6378.48 --> 6382.08
that sticks it stuck to me

6383.199 --> 6387.199
and when i say jesus christ i mean i'm

6386.4 --> 6390.239
not

6387.199 --> 6391.839999999999
speaking three-dimensional

6390.239 --> 6394.159
i'm not saying that he is not three

6391.84 --> 6396.8
demand i'm talking

6394.159 --> 6398.08
really heavy as a terrorism it's like

6396.8 --> 6400.56
that word has

6398.08 --> 6402.48
so much grip on things so many

6400.56 --> 6405.04
implications

6402.48 --> 6406.4
apart in the weave literally holding

6405.04 --> 6408.88
things in balance

6406.4 --> 6408.879999999999
in a way

6412.08 --> 6418.159
if you don't get that you're literally

6415.199 --> 6420.239
not seeing things as they really are and

6418.159 --> 6424.4
using your remnant talents

6420.239 --> 6427.759999999999
to try to fill in the entire picture

6424.4 --> 6429.36
incomplete and you can never complete it

6427.76 --> 6432.400000000001
and that's the problem

6429.36 --> 6433.04
that's the problem that's why then you

6432.4 --> 6437.04
won't be

6433.04 --> 6438.159
able to rest on each other's talents as

6437.04 --> 6441.6
much

6438.159 --> 6444.719
because it's incomplete and the ego

6441.6 --> 6457.84
is going to take control it happens

6444.719 --> 6457.84
every time

6460.41 --> 6463.66
[Applause]

6468.84 --> 6471.84
ah

6487.76 --> 6491.1990000000005
that's correct christopher newton it is

6490.159 --> 6493.119
really a

6491.199 --> 6494.48
don't throw the baby out with the bath

6493.119 --> 6499.839999999999
water situation

6494.48 --> 6499.839999999999
that's right

6518.08 --> 6521.76
ah oh there you go

6525.6 --> 6528.719
well no

6532.0 --> 6536.96
you see that that is just an esoteric

6534.56 --> 6538.88
riddle there foul and buchen

6536.96 --> 6541.52
what you put there that's an exoterra

6538.88 --> 6544.4800000000005
griddle

6541.52 --> 6545.040000000001
if you say this or repeat it and you

6544.48 --> 6548.959999999999
don't

6545.04 --> 6555.84
know what it even means

6548.96 --> 6555.84
then it means nothing

6559.52 --> 6566.56
if you just think that saying that

6562.96 --> 6569.04
or like confessing to i accept this

6566.56 --> 6570.719
and you don't know what it means then it

6569.04 --> 6573.199
means

6570.719 --> 6573.199
nothing

6575.199 --> 6580.799999999999
words you use when you don't understand

6578.96 --> 6583.28
the power of words and the wider

6580.8 --> 6587.119000000001
implications and the deeper structures

6583.28 --> 6587.119
mean very little

6587.599 --> 6592.08
if you don't understand the meaning of

6589.76 --> 6597.84
the words you use

6592.08 --> 6597.84
then it's not gonna mean anything

6615.599 --> 6622.2390000000005
right so moth ice jesus died because of

6618.239 --> 6622.239
your sins that doesn't mean anything

6622.56 --> 6639.84
that's exoteric priest talk

6640.719 --> 6647.52
like if you could literally

6643.92 --> 6650.56
word by word explain

6647.52 --> 6653.119000000001
what that means

6650.56 --> 6654.320000000001
okay then then you might get somewhere

6653.119 --> 6657.679
but unless you

6654.32 --> 6661.04
completely br all in the

6657.679 --> 6663.119
very complicated overarching situation

6661.04 --> 6665.199
and creation

6663.119 --> 6666.4
and foresight and all that if you're

6665.199 --> 6667.839999999999
really in

6666.4 --> 6670.32
other words it's just not gonna mean

6667.84 --> 6670.32
anything

6672.719 --> 6679.52
it's just esoteric parroting

6677.92 --> 6681.28
if you just say it and you don't

6679.52 --> 6684.400000000001
understand what it means

6681.28 --> 6686.8
it doesn't mean anything

6684.4 --> 6688.5599999999995
it's just gonna be parroting ah and

6686.8 --> 6691.360000000001
you're gonna see it in people's eyes

6688.56 --> 6692.159000000001
when people say things and they really

6691.36 --> 6694.719
get it

6692.159 --> 6695.28
while they're saying it you can see it

6694.719 --> 6698.4
in

6695.28 --> 6698.96
their eyes always pay attention to the

6698.4 --> 6702.4
eyes

6698.96 --> 6703.44
always when something is said it means a

6702.4 --> 6705.679
lot

6703.44 --> 6707.44
i always look at the eyes and they don't

6705.679 --> 6710.8
have to look back at you

6707.44 --> 6710.799999999999
you only have to see

6710.96 --> 6713.52
their eyes

6715.28 --> 6719.119
and if you don't have sight on the eyes

6718.0 --> 6722.239
then you can still see

6719.119 --> 6723.5199999999995
things by their body composure

6722.239 --> 6725.28
and if you can't see their body

6723.52 --> 6728.400000000001
composure then you can pick up

6725.28 --> 6729.759999999999
on the vibration and nuances within

6728.4 --> 6732.08
their voice

6729.76 --> 6733.599
and any kind of stumbles they make means

6732.08 --> 6751.84
a lot

6733.599 --> 6751.84
but the eyes revealed the most

6755.48 --> 6758.639999999999
[Music]

6778.0 --> 6785.199
right morpha lumbo canon that yeah that

6782.08 --> 6788.0
those are yeah that's a critical concept

6785.199 --> 6789.04
it is really look the whole point to the

6788.0 --> 6792.8
freaking bible

6789.04 --> 6795.36
is to disengage from the devil

6792.8 --> 6795.92
through the ego and the processes that

6795.36 --> 6799.679
keep you

6795.92 --> 6801.679
into that cycle and connect to creation

6799.679 --> 6805.04
to the rest of the world again

6801.679 --> 6808.4
the bible and the things even

6805.04 --> 6809.679
through the priesthood what they

6808.4 --> 6812.159
encourage you to do yes

6809.679 --> 6813.599
it partially has that process of

6812.159 --> 6818.0
confession

6813.599 --> 6821.599
and acceptance except confessing

6818.0 --> 6823.679
of the ego

6821.599 --> 6825.28
what has happened and the influence the

6823.679 --> 6828.32
pressure and

6825.28 --> 6831.599
accepting creation

6828.32 --> 6832.32
like accepting it back in when you're

6831.599 --> 6835.360000000001
closed off

6832.32 --> 6838.799999999999
because of your ego right those

6835.36 --> 6841.679
elements are very important to

6838.8 --> 6841.679
being a christian

6844.719 --> 6849.84
fundamental one could argue

6850.8 --> 6854.96
because it is about action it's about

6854.08 --> 6860.159
action

6854.96 --> 6860.159
conscious decision engagement

6860.84 --> 6866.719
and well not surrendering

6863.52 --> 6869.599
to to the devil

6866.719 --> 6869.599
through the ego

6870.08 --> 6873.76
because that's usually how he comes to

6874.84 --> 6879.599
you

6876.239 --> 6879.598999999999
that's where he seduces you

6880.719 --> 6883.84
anyway i think i'm gonna round out the

6883.119 --> 6886.96
