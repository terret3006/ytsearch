if any

121.259 --> 126.659
right so the weather today

124.2 --> 130.64000000000001
is well it was kind of sunny and nice

126.659 --> 130.64000000000001
but yeah now clouds are

131.22 --> 137.34
kind of ruining that a bit

134.04 --> 138.94
but it's a much clearer day

137.34 --> 142.18
there's no rain

138.94 --> 142.18
[Music]

142.68 --> 147.98000000000002
I think

144.72 --> 147.98
I'm not over here anyway

149.53 --> 154.139
[Music]

157.26 --> 161.94
it seems

158.819 --> 167.0
almost wins still again

161.94 --> 167.0
right it's kind of a weird quiet day

178.62 --> 181.16
right

181.26 --> 186.239
so yeah yesterday's show was a a bit of

185.099 --> 188.51899999999998
a uh

186.239 --> 190.31900000000002
disaster I'm not

188.519 --> 191.59
extreme but

190.319 --> 192.83999999999997
still

191.59 --> 196.34
[Music]

192.84 --> 196.34
that didn't really work out

197.76 --> 201.07999999999998
let's not do that today

201.18 --> 205.26000000000002
I've been wondering though if it was

203.28 --> 207.18
just because I had that one beer that

205.26 --> 210.12
everything went wrong

207.18 --> 213.019
it's really weird anyway didn't do that

210.12 --> 213.019
yesterday of course

213.659 --> 217.819
and uh yeah we'll see what happens today

218.4 --> 222.20000000000002
pretty focused well rested

223.77 --> 230.36
[Music]

225.84 --> 230.36
I had decent dinner and all that

235.26 --> 241.379
Guns of Navarone came to me

238.92 --> 244.879
wanting to bury the hatchet

241.379 --> 244.879
I'm like okay sure

247.2 --> 252.42
checked yet if he's actually banned or

249.599 --> 254.39999999999998
not I don't think so though

252.42 --> 256.139
not sure

254.4 --> 259.34000000000003
I don't think it got out of hand that

256.139 --> 259.34000000000003
much last time

261.72 --> 265.1
let me check

266.71 --> 271.12
[Music]

277.59 --> 281.96
[Music]

279.36 --> 281.96000000000004
nope

282.3 --> 287.419
hey geoshifter first in chat good to see

285.3 --> 287.41900000000004
you

289.02 --> 293.59999999999997
I saw that video of yours it's been a

291.479 --> 293.59999999999997
while

295.02 --> 301.32
uh-huh

297.72 --> 303.78000000000003
about the uh well it's that's the new

301.32 --> 307.08
age scam you're talking about

303.78 --> 309.78
are you seeing it pop back up again

307.08 --> 313.58
like that stuff happened like when I was

309.78 --> 313.58
15 out there

315.54 --> 322.3
and I was in a way all into it but I was

319.04 --> 325.499
into Dimensions no matter what

322.3 --> 325.499
[Music]

326.039 --> 331.62
all that stuff

327.78 --> 334.44
still being pushed yeah but I mean

331.62 --> 339.12
pushed pushed or still a couple of

334.44 --> 342.78
enthusiasts yet just just keep going

339.12 --> 344.94
and it might still be slowly growing

342.78 --> 347.15999999999997
or is this like a

344.94 --> 350.12
a corporate push what what are you

347.16 --> 350.12
talking about exactly

353.88 --> 358.94
I mean it's like a new age belief that's

355.86 --> 358.94
been around for a while

361.56 --> 366.62
but you love videos all the time

368.1 --> 376.5
okay well that's on video right I mean

373.979 --> 379.44
unless you're literally bumping into

376.5 --> 382.56
that everywhere you go

379.44 --> 384.66
on YouTube or

382.56 --> 387.6
like

384.66 --> 390.6
more mainstream television stuff right

387.6 --> 392.759
then I'd say they're pushing it right

390.6 --> 395.28000000000003
then it's like mainstream

392.759 --> 399.74
then they're mainstreaming it

395.28 --> 399.73999999999995
right but I haven't really seen that

400.38 --> 403.979
so it's just people that that are into

402.479 --> 406.5
that sort of thing

403.979 --> 409.88
is kind of hippie-ish right it's the

406.5 --> 409.88
hippie science fiction stuff

412.62 --> 418.319
which happens to be exactly what I was

416.039 --> 422.58
was both a hippie and into science

418.319 --> 424.199
fiction when I was like 15

422.58 --> 426.71999999999997
pretty much

424.199 --> 428.1
till I was 19.

426.72 --> 430.86
hey

428.1 --> 434.40000000000003
guns on that run

430.86 --> 437.28000000000003
oh thanks wow yes

434.4 --> 439.34
I appreciate that welcome back by the

437.28 --> 439.34
way

442.02 --> 447.02
I'm really glad that that hatchet is

444.599 --> 447.02
buried

456.18 --> 461.759
wow thank you man I really appreciate

459.0 --> 463.38
that and yeah I was kind of needing that

461.759 --> 466.139
so

463.38 --> 468.5
thank you very much

466.139 --> 468.5
oh

473.819 --> 478.40000000000003
right let's get back on track

480.12 --> 483.12
no

484.62 --> 487.58
hope you're doing good

490.02 --> 494.21999999999997
you sound like you've like had some kind

492.419 --> 496.85999999999996
of spiritual weight falling off your

494.22 --> 499.91900000000004
shoulders of some kind

496.86 --> 501.78000000000003
yesterday already when you said that

499.919 --> 503.75899999999996
so

501.78 --> 505.919
deserve it thank you man I appreciate

503.759 --> 508.68
that

505.919 --> 510.06
and I'm glad that you're

508.68 --> 512.779
like

510.06 --> 515.099
back on a good track spiritually I I

512.779 --> 517.88
might be presumptuous just the

515.099 --> 517.88
impression I got

518.279 --> 525.68
thank you

519.839 --> 525.6800000000001
anyway hey turret 306 and letter Sage

528.94 --> 532.769
[Music]

545.04 --> 550.56
tires all right well because look

548.279 --> 552.24
geoshifter it might be that there's just

550.56 --> 555.56
a

552.24 --> 555.5600000000001
a migration

556.98 --> 560.22
of

558.3 --> 562.3199999999999
those types of people

560.22 --> 564.36
that like to talk about that stuff to

562.32 --> 566.0400000000001
[ __ ] you

564.36 --> 569.9590000000001
I don't know maybe they've been getting

566.04 --> 569.959
banned in certain places or something

570.959 --> 575.2199999999999
I don't know

572.88 --> 577.08
maybe they're targeted now

575.22 --> 578.76
by the machine

577.08 --> 581.4200000000001
for some reason

578.76 --> 581.42
I don't know

581.52 --> 586.24
[Music]

587.04 --> 595.0799999999999
or I don't know or maybe somehow you be

590.82 --> 597.1800000000001
the algorithm if that even if bits you

595.08 --> 601.7
doesn't even do that

597.18 --> 601.6999999999999
I don't know but maybe it's just

602.22 --> 607.85
sizing you up as like yeah you gotta

604.5 --> 611.7
look into that for some reason

607.85 --> 611.7
[Music]

612.12 --> 616.64
nobody's making videos calling it BS

618.12 --> 620.66
well

621.36 --> 627.86
okay well maybe it's just kind of

624.899 --> 627.86
pointless I mean

629.339 --> 635.94
and besides like people that typically

632.399 --> 637.86
make videos about [ __ ] being pointless

635.94 --> 640.8000000000001
right

637.86 --> 643.44
that that get a bit of attention

640.8 --> 646.62
they're usually like very mainstream

643.44 --> 650.0400000000001
well from a mainstream perspective the

646.62 --> 652.74
idea of ascending to a higher dimension

650.04 --> 655.88
in the current cosmology and everything

652.74 --> 658.6800000000001
that's attached onto it wildly

655.88 --> 661.019
incoherently but still it's there

658.68 --> 662.64
yeah it actually isn't really that all

661.019 --> 665.48
that bizarre

662.64 --> 665.48
an idea

666.42 --> 671.66
right

668.459 --> 671.66
think of it like that

671.82 --> 677.4590000000001
so maybe like people don't re they think

675.06 --> 679.4399999999999
they're stupid and a lot of people out

677.459 --> 681.0
there probably think oh whoa we're so

679.44 --> 682.3800000000001
much better ways to understand all the

681.0 --> 684.3
science and

682.38 --> 686.54
they just don't think it's really worth

684.3 --> 686.54
it

688.74 --> 694.5600000000001
it's not a threat to them

691.62 --> 697.519
because it's not flat Earth

694.56 --> 697.5189999999999
something like that

703.2 --> 707.4590000000001
I mean I think that overall everything

705.6 --> 711.48
is pretty much tolerated out there

707.459 --> 714.1199999999999
except Flat Earth that's when you really

711.48 --> 716.6
get shot on the side just remains that

714.12 --> 716.6
really

718.57 --> 724.519
[Music]

720.72 --> 724.519
been trying absolutely everything

726.12 --> 730.16
doesn't really seem to matter at all

731.88 --> 736.68
like to the system I mean what I'm doing

734.64 --> 739.079
will matter to those people that follow

736.68 --> 740.64
me and

739.079 --> 743.16
right

740.64 --> 745.8199999999999
but the system just doesn't give a [ __ ]

743.16 --> 745.8199999999999
what I do

749.22 --> 754.38
that's just keeping me in in this

752.1 --> 758.48
spot

754.38 --> 758.48
and people don't really know about me

761.519 --> 766.639
and I don't yeah I've already proposed

763.62 --> 769.38
that if I suddenly wildly became known

766.639 --> 771.5600000000001
that would be kind of scary in a way to

769.38 --> 771.56
me

771.839 --> 777.6600000000001
even though I am very open but because

775.079 --> 780.54
of that it's almost like

777.66 --> 783.899
could I still just be me if suddenly

780.54 --> 786.24
everybody was watching

783.899 --> 789.48
like with actual attention

786.24 --> 792.1800000000001
that that would be weird and like the

789.48 --> 794.04
chat would be completely untenable I

792.18 --> 798.1389999999999
would have to create some kind of

794.04 --> 798.139
hierarchy system like Big Bear

798.66 --> 803.76
like you have to be able to

801.24 --> 805.98
yeah well maybe it worked it would work

803.76 --> 808.3389999999999
but I would become very busy with the

805.98 --> 808.339
jet

812.7 --> 818.279
I don't know if I could handle that

815.82 --> 820.82
but I mean I could definitely scale it

818.279 --> 820.82
up a bit

820.92 --> 826.8
maybe it is happening it's just

822.66 --> 830.459
happening really slowly I'm not sure

826.8 --> 834.24
what do you guys think I mean is my chat

830.459 --> 836.579
actually better compared to say

834.24 --> 840.6800000000001
two years ago

836.579 --> 840.68
or is it the same

841.019 --> 844.16
the quality of it

845.04 --> 850.139
I think I at least it's a little less

847.98 --> 852.3000000000001
Wild

850.139 --> 855.1800000000001
because things did get like kind of wild

852.3 --> 856.3199999999999
back at the day in the day and it would

855.18 --> 860.6389999999999
get

856.32 --> 862.38
more angry and less really aware about

860.639 --> 866.4590000000001
that

862.38 --> 868.9399999999999
what to do with it than I am now

866.459 --> 868.9399999999999
but

869.94 --> 876.44
maybe the chat is just more fluid now

874.139 --> 880.279
It's just sometimes at the beginning

876.44 --> 880.2790000000001
everybody's late for some reason

881.699 --> 886.04
or it's one of those days where nobody

883.5 --> 886.04
can get up

886.579 --> 892.199
and I mean for people in the United

889.139 --> 896.22
States which and Canada

892.199 --> 898.4399999999999
which is a whoa I'd say at least more

896.22 --> 900.36
than half my following yeah they're

898.44 --> 902.6990000000001
they're all very early too early for

900.36 --> 905.4590000000001
them my show so yeah

902.699 --> 907.74
it becomes an issue of sleeping out by

905.459 --> 911.5999999999999
accident or just not wanting to wake up

907.74 --> 911.6
yeah you would be late

912.24 --> 916.74
so that's like a

913.94 --> 918.6600000000001
occupational hazard

916.74 --> 921.839
and I have to just learn to deal with it

918.66 --> 924.06
and not be impatient somehow

921.839 --> 926.4590000000001
but it is kind of tough for me still to

924.06 --> 927.4799999999999
switch from just like okay I'm just

926.459 --> 930.06
talking

927.48 --> 932.639
to whoever might be listening at some

930.06 --> 935.579
point or somebody's in the background or

932.639 --> 938.339
I'm actually interacting and

935.579 --> 941.519
delving up subjects

938.339 --> 945.62
to talk about from the chat

941.519 --> 945.62
it's kind of a switch for me to do that

946.92 --> 952.199
because sometimes I'm just like I become

949.44 --> 955.0400000000001
dependent on the chat just new things

952.199 --> 955.04
won't pop up

956.639 --> 960.12
in my mind

958.74 --> 964.04
just

960.12 --> 964.04
staring at the screen and thinking

966.66 --> 970.92
which chat member is your favorite chat

969.42 --> 974.04
participant

970.92 --> 977.8389999999999
oh that's a that's not yeah I know

974.04 --> 977.8389999999999
that's really difficult to say

980.339 --> 983.9590000000001
I mean seriously Terry

985.44 --> 993.1800000000001
but you're definitely among my favorites

990.36 --> 996.74
and so it's flatter Sage

993.18 --> 996.7399999999999
and English G of course

997.259 --> 1003.86
but yeah it's because LSG and me also

1000.38 --> 1006.459
just have contact outside of the chat

1003.86 --> 1006.4590000000001
here

1009.44 --> 1016.22
and dude he makes like stuff music and

1014.12 --> 1018.88
I don't know I just really appreciate

1016.22 --> 1018.88
him anyway

1020.779 --> 1025.52
but for example and this is the weird

1023.0 --> 1030.1
part Rasta hat

1025.52 --> 1030.1
is among my favorites as well

1030.799 --> 1036.3799999999999
but sometimes just our spiritual

1033.02 --> 1038.66
chemistry just collides

1036.38 --> 1041.48
really badly

1038.66 --> 1043.64
and that happened yesterday

1041.48 --> 1044.54
and I don't want to get into it really I

1043.64 --> 1048.5790000000002
mean

1044.54 --> 1048.579
I think I said everything about it

1055.46 --> 1059.419
don't want to like tune back into that

1057.559 --> 1061.039
frequency because that really made me

1059.419 --> 1063.2
miserable

1061.039 --> 1065.179
let that happen

1063.2 --> 1066.559
anyway

1065.179 --> 1069.039
nightbot

1066.559 --> 1069.039
what

1069.2 --> 1071.799
okay

1072.74 --> 1078.86
well

1075.14 --> 1082.88
if I'd have to say in general a chat

1078.86 --> 1085.039
participant in general entirely right

1082.88 --> 1087.2
yeah see me travel is also among my

1085.039 --> 1089.419
favorites

1087.2 --> 1093.14
of course I mean

1089.419 --> 1095.5590000000002
yeah but almost everybody that gets a

1093.14 --> 1095.5590000000002
wrench

1095.84 --> 1098.3799999999999
right

1101.78 --> 1107.36
it it usually is if you just keep on

1104.66 --> 1109.94
coming and I don't kick you out

1107.36 --> 1110.54
you could consider yourself among my

1109.94 --> 1112.94
favorites

1110.54 --> 1115.6399999999999
[Laughter]

1112.94 --> 1117.98
in that sense even a kumu virus is kind

1115.64 --> 1122.21
of in that list too yeah I know and a

1117.98 --> 1125.309
lot of you can't stand the guy I get it

1122.21 --> 1125.309
[Music]

1125.36 --> 1130.6999999999998
right

1126.62 --> 1134.4189999999999
but in general one of the most awesome

1130.7 --> 1137.059
chat YouTube chat participants would be

1134.419 --> 1139.039
Divergent Droid that guy is freaking

1137.059 --> 1143.1789999999999
amazing

1139.039 --> 1146.0
I mean he literally like has his own

1143.179 --> 1149.3600000000001
job that he just does

1146.0 --> 1152.36
where he keeps track of links

1149.36 --> 1155.86
and then post them even during premieres

1152.36 --> 1155.86
and stuff it's amazing

1158.24 --> 1164.419
he's super dedicated and really

1161.24 --> 1167.419
effective and always in good spirit I've

1164.419 --> 1169.16
never seen an actually I've seen him one

1167.419 --> 1170.9
time where he seemed like he would be

1169.16 --> 1175.3400000000001
pissed off but then he was just super

1170.9 --> 1177.52
stoic about it I mean the guy is amazing

1175.34 --> 1177.52
foreign

1196.299 --> 1202.6399999999999
but dude you know I love you having you

1199.46 --> 1204.6200000000001
around except when you get a bit too

1202.64 --> 1207.0200000000002
hot-headed and out of control especially

1204.62 --> 1209.7199999999998
when I'm a little

1207.02 --> 1212.9
sensitive to that yeah that's not a good

1209.72 --> 1214.82
combination sometimes but you know I

1212.9 --> 1218.679
appreciate your presence and you bring a

1214.82 --> 1218.6789999999999
lot of interesting knowledge

1220.24 --> 1226.1
including Regional stuff from your

1223.94 --> 1228.17
country and I really appreciate that

1226.1 --> 1231.369
input

1228.17 --> 1231.3690000000001
[Music]

1232.1 --> 1237.26
like he's very good at this job yeah but

1234.559 --> 1241.1789999999999
look so the weird thing is not actually

1237.26 --> 1241.179
his job he's not he's just doing that

1242.9 --> 1247.8400000000001
so he's just doing it as a volunteer

1245.179 --> 1247.8400000000001
completely

1248.41 --> 1251.63
[Music]

1253.46 --> 1257.44
that's pretty amazing anyway

1257.48 --> 1262.64
right hope you guys are all doing good

1259.76 --> 1265.1
yeah flatters debate yesterday was

1262.64 --> 1267.5300000000002
really interesting and

1265.1 --> 1269.24
well I was there the entire ride

1267.53 --> 1272.539
[Music]

1269.24 --> 1274.22
didn't go out I will go out today though

1272.539 --> 1276.34
uh

1274.22 --> 1280.72
but Nathan was just incredibly

1276.34 --> 1280.72
complementary and just let me

1281.48 --> 1287.419
yeah lay down

1283.34 --> 1289.1589999999999
the ball win perspective of how gravity

1287.419 --> 1291.0200000000002
keeps the grass pressure to the Earth

1289.159 --> 1293.44
and

1291.02 --> 1296.0
and like the internal mechanism

1293.44 --> 1298.22
psychologically of what happens like

1296.0 --> 1300.98
what happens when I think about it as

1298.22 --> 1303.6200000000001
always and it was just yeah that was

1300.98 --> 1304.24
amazing like

1303.62 --> 1307.4399999999998
foreign

1304.24 --> 1307.44
[Music]

1310.88 --> 1315.7990000000002
turn around 180 degrees so it's like you

1313.28 --> 1317.539
get full energy from everybody so I

1315.799 --> 1320.059
don't know everybody was really nice I

1317.539 --> 1322.82
think maybe they saw what happened at my

1320.059 --> 1325.72
show I don't know

1322.82 --> 1325.72
it's kind of weird

1327.799 --> 1331.9
but I did appreciate that

1334.7 --> 1339.2
give me a boost so I appreciate that

1337.039 --> 1341.919
from the guys

1339.2 --> 1341.919
uh

1347.08 --> 1350.98
yeah more reviewing

1352.22 --> 1356.919
reviewing more videos I don't remember

1354.5 --> 1356.919
who's

1359.24 --> 1362.1200000000001
it

1360.679 --> 1365.1200000000001
was that

1362.12 --> 1367.6399999999999
that guy playing Minecraft or Lego

1365.12 --> 1369.4399999999998
thingy or something

1367.64 --> 1373.4
about the kid

1369.44 --> 1376.3400000000001
kids in his class Gen X

1373.4 --> 1378.26
and he called it that we're talking that

1376.34 --> 1380.84
may we're making Flat Earth arguments

1378.26 --> 1383.059
and it was being extremely baller-ish

1380.84 --> 1385.1
about it

1383.059 --> 1387.2
right so that was the Flat Earth debate

1385.1 --> 1389.86
yesterday

1387.2 --> 1389.8600000000001
uh

1401.419 --> 1409.9
all right yeah flat side

1404.96 --> 1409.9
I didn't watch it though not really

1410.72 --> 1416.659
uh Jim Bob

1413.72 --> 1418.94
did watch that

1416.659 --> 1421.46
I think partially

1418.94 --> 1424.1200000000001
I didn't watch something didn't watch a

1421.46 --> 1424.1200000000001
movie or something

1438.02 --> 1444.4
I don't know it gets a bit fuzzy

1441.08 --> 1444.3999999999999
memory in the evening

1445.44 --> 1449.079
[Music]

1460.46 --> 1465.08
yeah flutter Sage I know

1462.799 --> 1469.52
no the guy

1465.08 --> 1472.76
probably talked to

1469.52 --> 1475.34
like some Jesuits I call those jet it's

1472.76 --> 1478.539
not literally that it's just like

1475.34 --> 1482.36
anti-flat earthers I mean in my school

1478.539 --> 1485.299
there were anti-flat earthers

1482.36 --> 1489.62
and I confused the [ __ ] out of them

1485.299 --> 1494.36
because I was like doing it for the ball

1489.62 --> 1495.62
but also like technically knew it it was

1494.36 --> 1498.1999999999998
flat

1495.62 --> 1501.1399999999999
and was compared I was really like

1498.2 --> 1504.0800000000002
trying to be a good boy

1501.14 --> 1507.7990000000002
not fooling myself but going along with

1504.08 --> 1509.62
it perfectly and actually trying to help

1507.799 --> 1513.6399999999999
them out was

1509.62 --> 1513.6399999999999
psychologically kind of bizarre

1514.94 --> 1518.24
so yeah that's not really comparable to

1517.159 --> 1520.46
this guy

1518.24 --> 1522.6200000000001
this guy probably talked to some of

1520.46 --> 1525.8600000000001
those anti-flat earthers and they are

1522.62 --> 1527.12
really into this [ __ ]

1525.86 --> 1529.4599999999998
like

1527.12 --> 1530.6589999999999
Simon then and fight the Flat Earth and

1529.46 --> 1532.94
others

1530.659 --> 1535.3400000000001
and like the more

1532.94 --> 1537.44
the higher level ones that really talk

1535.34 --> 1540.9189999999999
mechanics

1537.44 --> 1544.1000000000001
some of them astrophysics blabbering

1540.919 --> 1547.5200000000002
even back then there were like radio

1544.1 --> 1549.74
shows of people doing that instead that

1547.52 --> 1552.6399999999999
those people would follow and get their

1549.74 --> 1552.64
arguments from

1556.279 --> 1561.62
or they were just really smart and then

1559.22 --> 1564.1000000000001
mechanically back engineered it all

1561.62 --> 1564.1
themselves

1564.38 --> 1569.419
right

1566.72 --> 1571.4
but yeah

1569.419 --> 1573.44
he probably talked to those types of

1571.4 --> 1575.539
people not actually looking into it

1573.44 --> 1578.3600000000001
himself and so

1575.539 --> 1580.76
he got some tips and like oh you look

1578.36 --> 1581.6
for these things or here's the links for

1580.76 --> 1584.179
that

1581.6 --> 1586.82
so you got some material but only from

1584.179 --> 1590.48
an anti-flat earther so he didn't he

1586.82 --> 1593.12
only has that specialist knowledge as

1590.48 --> 1594.679
something to fall back on but not a

1593.12 --> 1597.02
wider oversight because he didn't

1594.679 --> 1599.38
actually look into it that's really what

1597.02 --> 1603.1399999999999
it looked like

1599.38 --> 1605.6200000000001
yeah her sounded like

1603.14 --> 1605.6200000000001
anyway

1607.279 --> 1614.26
one and a half years from now Fe will be

1610.46 --> 1614.26
coming it's already common knowledge

1614.84 --> 1620.0
foreign

1617.0 --> 1620.0
knowledge

1622.159 --> 1628.159
it's lit it in that sense

1625.059 --> 1632.6589999999999
in the literal sense of the word it is

1628.159 --> 1635.72
occult knowledge that is now everywhere

1632.659 --> 1638.0590000000002
everybody knows that there is something

1635.72 --> 1639.8600000000001
like Flat Earth whether they want to

1638.059 --> 1640.8799999999999
engage with it or not is is another

1639.86 --> 1641.9599999999998
matter

1640.88 --> 1644.0590000000002
right

1641.96 --> 1645.08
that's where the conditioning the

1644.059 --> 1647.4189999999999
trickery

1645.08 --> 1649.46
the ball religion is the most

1647.419 --> 1651.98
predominant in

1649.46 --> 1654.26
setting things up so that people are

1651.98 --> 1655.52
naturally discouraged to actually look

1654.26 --> 1657.8799999999999
into Flat Earth

1655.52 --> 1660.5
through conditioning

1657.88 --> 1663.7990000000002
[Music]

1660.5 --> 1666.1
we should get him only what yeah who won

1663.799 --> 1666.1
the show

1666.13 --> 1669.229
[Music]

1670.34 --> 1677.539
hello it's all doing nicely

1674.539 --> 1677.539
optimistic

1677.9 --> 1683.799
now it's all it's not optimistic it is

1681.02 --> 1683.799
common knowledge

1686.12 --> 1691.52
but there are people like everybody

1688.22 --> 1693.32
knows that it's out there so

1691.52 --> 1696.44
so if they're not

1693.32 --> 1697.7
knowing that it is out there not

1696.44 --> 1700.22
engaging

1697.7 --> 1702.44
then they still have knowledge of it so

1700.22 --> 1704.6000000000001
it is common knowledge

1702.44 --> 1706.8200000000002
there's no people out there that have

1704.6 --> 1709.24
never heard of Flat Earth

1706.82 --> 1709.24
okay

1714.32 --> 1720.62
but peoples or cultures entirely that do

1718.4 --> 1723.26
not engage with media

1720.62 --> 1725.4799999999998
right well where are those right I mean

1723.26 --> 1726.679
there's probably even like cell phones

1725.48 --> 1728.96
and

1726.679 --> 1730.64
a lot of parts in Africa but still in

1728.96 --> 1732.94
the parts where there's absolutely none

1730.64 --> 1732.94
of that

1733.52 --> 1736.82
where there's no electricity that's

1735.14 --> 1739.64
going to be hard to have no internet

1736.82 --> 1740.96
right no electricity yeah good luck with

1739.64 --> 1743.179
internet

1740.96 --> 1745.539
those people might have never heard of

1743.179 --> 1745.539
it ever

1749.24 --> 1753.679
but as soon as there's electricity

1751.7 --> 1755.659
there's going to be media because look

1753.679 --> 1759.14
at all the advantages well through media

1755.659 --> 1762.2600000000002
there will be people even getting bored

1759.14 --> 1764.659
and just randomly looking at stuff and

1762.26 --> 1766.76
they will figure out like what

1764.659 --> 1769.5800000000002
what is this guy talking about a flat

1766.76 --> 1773.299
earther for what is that

1769.58 --> 1776.4189999999999
like a flat earther what

1773.299 --> 1779.0
you mean like in school and it talked

1776.419 --> 1781.659
about the Middle East medieval I believe

1779.0 --> 1781.659
huh

1781.7 --> 1786.74
that's really that out there wow I gotta

1783.86 --> 1789.08
check that out right and then

1786.74 --> 1791.72
suddenly they figure out there's a whole

1789.08 --> 1793.46
world of weird people that they get to

1791.72 --> 1795.08
see the weirdos first of course that's

1793.46 --> 1797.6000000000001
really going to get shot in their face

1795.08 --> 1799.279
like the craziest [ __ ]

1797.6 --> 1801.86
and then

1799.279 --> 1803.84
like wow that's crazy and then they'll

1801.86 --> 1805.6399999999999
start looking into anti-flat earthers

1803.84 --> 1808.8799999999999
like oh those guys

1805.64 --> 1812.1200000000001
well they get it right well those guys

1808.88 --> 1815.2990000000002
will then sometimes like yeah they will

1812.12 --> 1817.039
be enamored with them maybe

1815.299 --> 1819.02
it's like ah it's a goofy internet

1817.039 --> 1822.2
person or something and then at some

1819.02 --> 1824.6589999999999
point they're gonna blabber about Nathan

1822.2 --> 1825.98
Oakley oh look at that oh he meant back

1824.659 --> 1828.8600000000001
and forth and you're like oh what's this

1825.98 --> 1830.539
[ __ ] and then suddenly they're right

1828.86 --> 1835.059
here

1830.539 --> 1835.059
right that's how it works

1836.96 --> 1844.46
just the internet

1840.34 --> 1846.98
and some time to actually like with

1844.46 --> 1848.779
boredom just do stuff on it and it's

1846.98 --> 1852.039
gonna happen

1848.779 --> 1852.039
eventually it is

1858.69 --> 1863.539
[Music]

1861.2 --> 1865.159
why do people access a screen to

1863.539 --> 1866.84
understand that the world is flat

1865.159 --> 1869.0590000000002
because otherwise

1866.84 --> 1872.0
they're just not really inclined to

1869.059 --> 1874.399
think about it at all

1872.0 --> 1877.46
right that's why I said it starts with

1874.399 --> 1879.62
the conditioning at school it's a globe

1877.46 --> 1881.96
it's not flat in medieval times people

1879.62 --> 1884.4189999999999
thought that they were wrong

1881.96 --> 1888.98
here's how you know the Earth is a globe

1884.419 --> 1891.919
glow the boats go below the horizon

1888.98 --> 1893.72
over the curve and oh yeah the angles of

1891.919 --> 1896.3600000000001
the sun match

1893.72 --> 1901.779
the sphericity of the Earth right that's

1896.36 --> 1901.779
basic [ __ ] that you get taught pre-teen

1902.0 --> 1908.96
and it's like real yeah to me when I got

1905.48 --> 1910.58
taught that it was like wow so oh this

1908.96 --> 1913.3400000000001
is it okay

1910.58 --> 1915.32
so really absorb that

1913.34 --> 1917.5
you'll really get to know it on the

1915.32 --> 1917.5
inside

1918.679 --> 1922.8200000000002
and that

1921.08 --> 1925.52
yeah you think about it and then

1922.82 --> 1926.96
eventually if you actually grow up and

1925.52 --> 1930.62
yeah

1926.96 --> 1933.14
not be as much as a dreamer as I was

1930.62 --> 1936.3799999999999
and then you'll get like job whatever

1933.14 --> 1938.6000000000001
family and you'll not really really be

1936.38 --> 1940.64
digging into that until you get kids and

1938.6 --> 1942.74
then it's like oh yeah they taught me

1940.64 --> 1944.3600000000001
this in school

1942.74 --> 1947.299
now they're getting taught that in

1944.36 --> 1951.34
school hot it's so cute

1947.299 --> 1951.34
and then you forget about it again

1953.0 --> 1957.98
right unless you really like watching

1956.24 --> 1960.08
television or

1957.98 --> 1962.179
whatever and then you're gonna get or

1960.08 --> 1965.0
movies and you're gonna then through the

1962.179 --> 1969.14
science fiction and the news items get

1965.0 --> 1970.22
pulled into more Globe related nonsense

1969.14 --> 1973.1200000000001
yeah

1970.22 --> 1973.1200000000001
that can happen

1973.899 --> 1979.899
not everybody is into like watching

1976.76 --> 1979.899
television or media

1981.38 --> 1985.94
anyway

1982.7 --> 1989.32
there's a joke to do no it's not you can

1985.94 --> 1989.3200000000002
get the [ __ ] out of here

1998.539 --> 2002.26
yes

1999.98 --> 2004.059
schools and deepest Africa being

2002.26 --> 2007.26
controlled by Propaganda are you kidding

2004.059 --> 2007.26
me hell yeah

2009.46 --> 2016.1200000000001
unless it's just like one Village

2013.84 --> 2019.48
completely isolated

2016.12 --> 2022.6
not constantly at war or at a threat or

2019.48 --> 2024.76
something and then they have their own

2022.6 --> 2027.48
school and yeah who knows what's getting

2024.76 --> 2027.48
taught at that

2030.039 --> 2036.519
but anything that's like

2032.82 --> 2040.08
involved technologically already

2036.519 --> 2040.08
that has like state

2040.24 --> 2045.159
bound

2041.86 --> 2046.1789999999999
uh institutes yeah they're gonna have

2045.159 --> 2049.119
that

2046.179 --> 2050.98
because it's like number one point in

2049.119 --> 2052.0
that system every time it's where it

2050.98 --> 2054.339
starts

2052.0 --> 2057.22
the education as soon as there's some

2054.339 --> 2058.859
kind of official education system

2057.22 --> 2062.1589999999997
guess what they're going to teach you

2058.859 --> 2062.159
the globe

2062.33 --> 2065.84
[Music]

2071.2 --> 2078.58
it's almost standardized in well it is

2075.76 --> 2080.139
standardized in government formation out

2078.58 --> 2083.139
of Chaos

2080.139 --> 2086.139
so one of the first thing they do

2083.139 --> 2089.619
right because it is considered the

2086.139 --> 2092.379
trademark of civilization to know the

2089.619 --> 2095.679
science reality that's

2092.379 --> 2099.04
what it is it's a spell

2095.679 --> 2103.78
and it binds everybody to let go of the

2099.04 --> 2105.82
old situation and go into modernity

2103.78 --> 2108.099
now we're better because we understand

2105.82 --> 2112.78
the globe and science like the entire

2108.099 --> 2116.099
world right that's what that is

2112.78 --> 2116.099
hello seeking star water

2118.839 --> 2124.0
right it's a spell effect It's very

2121.96 --> 2126.18
effective it is basically a

2124.0 --> 2129.94
transformation it's a transformation

2126.18 --> 2134.22
through reversed world it's

2129.94 --> 2134.2200000000003
an entire cosmology change

2138.94 --> 2144.94
you put a person you make them abandon

2142.599 --> 2146.5
everything that they were taught like

2144.94 --> 2150.339
the energy of it even

2146.5 --> 2153.04
reject all those ancient traditions and

2150.339 --> 2156.04
then replace it with science

2153.04 --> 2158.02
the idea of science

2156.04 --> 2161.16
and all the nonsense of the globe and

2158.02 --> 2161.16
everything that comes with that

2164.859 --> 2169.72
and that way

2166.54 --> 2172.0
yeah there is a it's a revolution it's

2169.72 --> 2173.68
like a spiritual Revolution and hey in

2172.0 --> 2177.04
some countries where there's just really

2173.68 --> 2178.2999999999997
a lot of malice and disgusting habits

2177.04 --> 2180.7599999999998
and [ __ ]

2178.3 --> 2183.94
where it's just gone to like this

2180.76 --> 2185.44
bestial situation and that does actually

2183.94 --> 2187.96
happen

2185.44 --> 2189.52
sometimes

2187.96 --> 2191.26
in the jungle

2189.52 --> 2194.74
jungle

2191.26 --> 2196.7200000000003
peoples and all that well then yeah it's

2194.74 --> 2201.9599999999996
a real big welcome to have something

2196.72 --> 2201.9599999999996
that just isn't that you see

2202.119 --> 2206.6800000000003
and to then switch like that in the

2204.7 --> 2209.74
entire basically abandon the entire

2206.68 --> 2212.6189999999997
spiritual root of what is currently

2209.74 --> 2215.2
festering then in such a situation see

2212.619 --> 2218.26
so that is

2215.2 --> 2221.0789999999997
how that is actually effective why that

2218.26 --> 2223.78
is a welcoming thing

2221.079 --> 2225.099
when people are all like demonic and

2223.78 --> 2228.82
[ __ ]

2225.099 --> 2230.6800000000003
and it's like oh we this is gone to [ __ ]

2228.82 --> 2232.9
I'm letting go of this spiritual route

2230.68 --> 2235.5989999999997
and the Heritage I'm now going to

2232.9 --> 2236.7000000000003
believe I'm gonna be rational and I'm

2235.599 --> 2238.6600000000003
gonna

2236.7 --> 2241.06
believe

2238.66 --> 2243.0989999999997
that science is the answer to everything

2241.06 --> 2245.38
and

2243.099 --> 2248.02
and get a really fuzzy about the

2245.38 --> 2250.54
scientific method and all that and right

2248.02 --> 2252.94
that's a different way of thinking and

2250.54 --> 2254.74
that you're no longer connected to that

2252.94 --> 2257.02
well

2254.74 --> 2259.4199999999996
the anger

2257.02 --> 2262.9
and all that that's happening in the

2259.42 --> 2265.48
just the the fear and the anger of the

2262.9 --> 2268.119
spirit of your ancestors that's then

2265.48 --> 2270.579
going on there

2268.119 --> 2271.599
right so it's a way to disengage from

2270.579 --> 2273.52
that

2271.599 --> 2277.839
and in that sense

2273.52 --> 2281.2
it does have a function right again

2277.839 --> 2284.2799999999997
just like Paul's teachings in the Bible

2281.2 --> 2288.5989999999997
even though they're highly

2284.28 --> 2288.599
contradicting to what Christ says

2290.44 --> 2295.78
a unique working

2293.619 --> 2298.9
in dealing with people that have like

2295.78 --> 2301.599
become really [ __ ] up and like heavily

2298.9 --> 2304.9
possessed and probably

2301.599 --> 2308.8590000000004
done crazy things and horrible things

2304.9 --> 2311.079
and then well the Paul's method is like

2308.859 --> 2313.839
probably one of the only ways that they

2311.079 --> 2316.54
would be able to prevent talented people

2313.839 --> 2317.98
that would go completely psychotic and

2316.54 --> 2320.2599999999998
psychopathic

2317.98 --> 2323.02
from being able to live with themselves

2320.26 --> 2325.0600000000004
so they could still use their skills

2323.02 --> 2326.74
even when something went terribly

2325.06 --> 2330.16
terribly wrong

2326.74 --> 2332.56
right so they're even to that

2330.16 --> 2336.8799999999997
you can argue that there is a reason for

2332.56 --> 2339.4
it to exist and to continue existing

2336.88 --> 2343.0
because of that unique function and I

2339.4 --> 2345.94
see the same with the globe I'm sorry

2343.0 --> 2349.78
even though it's yeah the people that

2345.94 --> 2351.7000000000003
use it now are so corrupted

2349.78 --> 2354.3590000000004
thank you

2351.7 --> 2354.359
right

2354.88 --> 2361.119
but yeah I I almost guarantee it

2358.54 --> 2363.18
I guarantee it that if they are

2361.119 --> 2367.48
completely capable and I'm talking about

2363.18 --> 2370.4199999999996
wef and New World Order

2367.48 --> 2373.2400000000002
because they wield this thing if they

2370.42 --> 2376.06
are actually capable of getting us into

2373.24 --> 2378.4199999999996
complete total chaotic Civil War

2376.06 --> 2382.24
situations

2378.42 --> 2383.92
then they will have the feeding ground

2382.24 --> 2388.2599999999998
the condition

2383.92 --> 2388.26
of which I just spoke

2388.54 --> 2396.18
they will be able to make people

2391.599 --> 2396.1800000000003
completely snap out of everything

2397.02 --> 2401.02
and abandon

2399.099 --> 2403.0
because of the pressure because of the

2401.02 --> 2405.22
roots because of the responsibility of

2403.0 --> 2407.68
being entangled with that

2405.22 --> 2412.06
to basically

2407.68 --> 2415.359
abandon that and then be complete blank

2412.06 --> 2417.04
slates that are like rationalists once

2415.359 --> 2418.9
again to themselves

2417.04 --> 2421.96
even though yeah

2418.9 --> 2423.88
spirit inside will absolutely collapse

2421.96 --> 2426.82
and

2423.88 --> 2428.7400000000002
it's definitely not a safe thing to do

2426.82 --> 2431.619
that I mean it's like a total conversion

2428.74 --> 2433.2999999999997
it's like switching from Paladin to

2431.619 --> 2436.119
to Black Guard

2433.3 --> 2439.0
yeah can you do

2436.119 --> 2442.54
it is catastrophe if you if that happens

2439.0 --> 2444.16
but that they will try

2442.54 --> 2447.04
right there's so many catastrophic

2444.16 --> 2449.859
things that could happen if

2447.04 --> 2452.5
if this all gets much worse

2449.859 --> 2454.98
and it is no it doesn't seem like it's

2452.5 --> 2454.98
gonna happen

2457.839 --> 2461.859
there's a lot of counter

2460.66 --> 2466.0
push

2461.859 --> 2469.02
now I'm a higher level even

2466.0 --> 2469.02
but still

2472.48 --> 2477.22
there's so much push something is gonna

2475.119 --> 2479.619
give and then what happens

2477.22 --> 2481.06
then what happens with the summoned

2479.619 --> 2483.1600000000003
Force

2481.06 --> 2485.4
the forces that are present on either

2483.16 --> 2485.3999999999996
side

2486.22 --> 2492.06
what's going to happen

2488.5 --> 2492.06
if it stops

2495.24 --> 2498.54
I don't know

2499.26 --> 2503.46
getting a bit esoteric Maybe

2508.0 --> 2514.53
but I wonder about things on that level

2511.28 --> 2514.53
[Music]

2514.839 --> 2520.0789999999997
foreign

2516.24 --> 2523.7799999999997
but I hope you guys get the whole shift

2520.079 --> 2525.3390000000004
thing it's like spiritual Alchemy of the

2523.78 --> 2528.3
situation

2525.339 --> 2528.2999999999997
and how

2528.94 --> 2533.92
like we see that all like little

2531.119 --> 2536.8
berberus countries

2533.92 --> 2539.859
oh they're in war again oh they they're

2536.8 --> 2543.46
terrible war crimes against each other

2539.859 --> 2545.56
and then like oh we get in there take

2543.46 --> 2548.579
control and then oh we're gonna teach

2545.56 --> 2548.5789999999997
them the new way

2548.8 --> 2553.96
and we've always been taught like yeah

2550.9 --> 2557.859
that's good that's civilized

2553.96 --> 2561.099
you don't realize that

2557.859 --> 2564.22
a lot of like spiritual Heritage is

2561.099 --> 2567.28
completely destroyed in that process

2564.22 --> 2572.22
because people get now brainwashed with

2567.28 --> 2572.2200000000003
the like the Western laws and all that

2572.35 --> 2579.22
[Music]

2575.5 --> 2581.88
what I don't know what

2579.22 --> 2581.8799999999997
ah

2582.819 --> 2586.8
okay Stephen Trump I was talking about

2589.9 --> 2594.579
spiritual Alchemy of the situation of

2593.2 --> 2596.98
when things are

2594.579 --> 2598.96
like out of control like Civil War

2596.98 --> 2601.839
scenarios

2598.96 --> 2604.9
that those have been used typically like

2601.839 --> 2607.42
in third world countries

2604.9 --> 2609.099
to

2607.42 --> 2612.099
get in there

2609.099 --> 2615.94
and then take care of it

2612.099 --> 2619.3590000000004
put somebody in power that is then going

2615.94 --> 2622.7200000000003
to introduce like heighten the quality

2619.359 --> 2624.88
but using Western methods and that means

2622.72 --> 2629.14
oh now you get all the doctors with all

2624.88 --> 2631.42
kinds of modern medical vaccines and you

2629.14 --> 2634.48
get the schooling with all this

2631.42 --> 2637.0
fantastic Globe lore and like social

2634.48 --> 2638.14
shaming and Punishment if you bring up

2637.0 --> 2641.5
like

2638.14 --> 2643.5989999999997
your ancestry or like

2641.5 --> 2645.88
I don't know whatever kind of local

2643.599 --> 2647.8
religion you might have there because

2645.88 --> 2649.78
that's outdated you're not supposed to

2647.8 --> 2652.54
bring it up and they will like

2649.78 --> 2653.8
physically punish children there

2652.54 --> 2656.619
okay

2653.8 --> 2659.98
it's not all nice and Sweden

2656.619 --> 2662.2000000000003
like oh like we have in Europe where

2659.98 --> 2664.48
everybody's so soft you can never be me

2662.2 --> 2666.52
yeah guess what over there

2664.48 --> 2670.599
they don't do that

2666.52 --> 2674.079
they get pretty brutal sometimes

2670.599 --> 2676.7200000000003
like nobody's gonna then like arrest

2674.079 --> 2679.8390000000004
that teacher

2676.72 --> 2682.54
because they don't give a [ __ ]

2679.839 --> 2685.18
right so conditioning it completely

2682.54 --> 2688.18
Alters

2685.18 --> 2692.0989999999997
the whole yeah it just gets in the way

2688.18 --> 2692.0989999999997
of the ancestral spirits that are there

2705.28 --> 2708.94
right I mean

2707.56 --> 2712.18
people

2708.94 --> 2714.16
there like in those regions where

2712.18 --> 2717.3999999999996
they're not Western and they have

2714.16 --> 2721.6189999999997
ancient Traditions like

2717.4 --> 2721.619
we don't understand that

2722.14 --> 2727.42
like even

2724.24 --> 2728.6189999999997
if you're supposedly of African blood

2727.42 --> 2731.619
descent

2728.619 --> 2733.48
and you've grown up or were born in

2731.619 --> 2735.2200000000003
another country in a western country and

2733.48 --> 2738.94
you grew up there and even if you had

2735.22 --> 2740.339
kind of decent parents you have no idea

2738.94 --> 2744.52
because

2740.339 --> 2746.68
you're rooted spiritually in another

2744.52 --> 2749.8
type of energy so then you don't

2746.68 --> 2752.74
understand what those people actually do

2749.8 --> 2754.78
with their spirits

2752.74 --> 2756.22
you will just not understand they might

2754.78 --> 2761.38
not even have

2756.22 --> 2764.68
abilities there to communicate that

2761.38 --> 2766.3
in a way that's translatable

2764.68 --> 2768.7599999999998
right

2766.3 --> 2770.2000000000003
and those are the types of things that

2768.76 --> 2774.2400000000002
get destroyed

2770.2 --> 2776.98
when a Western Country comes to help

2774.24 --> 2780.04
transform the country

2776.98 --> 2782.02
and maybe I don't know like how they the

2780.04 --> 2785.5
the Chinese

2782.02 --> 2787.3
allegedly are also supposed to be going

2785.5 --> 2789.04
in there and

2787.3 --> 2790.96
and doing that sort of thing with

2789.04 --> 2793.7799999999997
certain African countries so I heard

2790.96 --> 2798.2400000000002
I've not really looked into it so I

2793.78 --> 2798.2400000000002
heard and I wonder do they do that too

2801.94 --> 2808.119
in some way I kind of doubt it

2805.48 --> 2810.339
that they would force education and all

2808.119 --> 2813.46
that I think they're more much more like

2810.339 --> 2815.56
oh no wait just all business

2813.46 --> 2818.76
you bring worker

2815.56 --> 2818.7599999999998
we get your money

2819.819 --> 2823.48
maybe cell phone

2821.619 --> 2824.7400000000002
right something like that

2823.48 --> 2828.4
I don't know

2824.74 --> 2830.56
maybe they do have things they do that

2828.4 --> 2833.02
the Chinese like meddle with social

2830.56 --> 2835.42
engineering like westerners typically

2833.02 --> 2837.599
tend to do

2835.42 --> 2837.599
thank you

2841.079 --> 2849.599
but anyway yeah that

2845.14 --> 2849.5989999999997
I am concerned about those things

2850.66 --> 2855.46
because in the past I was not concerned

2853.72 --> 2859.0
the slightest

2855.46 --> 2860.8
but then I would still feel

2859.0 --> 2863.38
things

2860.8 --> 2865.7200000000003
that I didn't understand

2863.38 --> 2868.44
in that direction over there in Africa

2865.72 --> 2868.4399999999996
especially

2870.9 --> 2875.56
yeah

2872.56 --> 2875.56
anyway

2884.98 --> 2887.76
right

2893.98 --> 2899.099
but those things are important and that

2896.14 --> 2899.0989999999997
is also where

2899.38 --> 2904.599
foreign

2901.599 --> 2904.599
programming

2905.14 --> 2911.7999999999997
can be considered dangerous right

2908.44 --> 2914.26
I mean yeah it works probably on the

2911.8 --> 2917.92
short run you can really transform a

2914.26 --> 2921.94
country relatively quickly from a highly

2917.92 --> 2923.56
agitated War mindset situation

2921.94 --> 2925.9
to

2923.56 --> 2928.359
not So Much Anymore

2925.9 --> 2931.079
because of the aggressive conditioning

2928.359 --> 2931.0789999999997
and programming

2931.839 --> 2938.2
but by doing so also

2935.8 --> 2940.54
it's like you could see it like it's

2938.2 --> 2943.18
there's a spiritual wound it's kind of

2940.54 --> 2946.42
festering it's painful

2943.18 --> 2949.24
but not this is not literally medical

2946.42 --> 2952.2400000000002
advice this is a metaphor you could like

2949.24 --> 2955.0
let just let it do its thing

2952.24 --> 2957.52
like Eat Right rest well

2955.0 --> 2959.92
like I mean if it's literally you gotta

2957.52 --> 2961.78
get the dirt out right from any wound

2959.92 --> 2963.52
now I'm getting literal but you just

2961.78 --> 2967.1400000000003
gotta like let it sit

2963.52 --> 2967.14
right well if you then

2967.48 --> 2974.38
do like a globe transformation right

2971.98 --> 2976.599
on a country educational that's like

2974.38 --> 2979.599
suddenly

2976.599 --> 2981.88
like

2979.599 --> 2985.2400000000002
in injecting like

2981.88 --> 2986.92
intense drugs that will just immediately

2985.24 --> 2989.56
suppress

2986.92 --> 2992.6800000000003
inflammation effect or something right

2989.56 --> 2994.96
and then it's like oh wow it's gone it

2992.68 --> 2998.2599999999998
might even heal up

2994.96 --> 3000.06
but then you notice that you're starting

2998.26 --> 3002.76
to get just because of that one

3000.06 --> 3004.319
intervention that your entire system is

3002.76 --> 3006.48
screwed up

3004.319 --> 3011.3
and you're like having Amnesia or

3006.48 --> 3011.3
something it's like what who am I

3014.4 --> 3018.6600000000003
right so arguably oh if you could do

3016.619 --> 3021.78
that to save your life well is their

3018.66 --> 3023.7
life really in danger or was it just

3021.78 --> 3026.119
really painful

3023.7 --> 3026.1189999999997
right

3026.16 --> 3032.5989999999997
that's kind of the metaphor with this

3028.92 --> 3032.599
type of Western intervention

3033.3 --> 3037.94
that tends to come with conditioning

3038.04 --> 3042.359
uh I think that conditioning what is it

3041.52 --> 3043.079
called

3042.359 --> 3045.92
um

3043.079 --> 3045.92
the name

3048.119 --> 3053.599
I call it Western but it has another

3049.92 --> 3053.599
name what do you call that

3060.24 --> 3063.24
foreign

3067.28 --> 3070.46
like another

3071.339 --> 3076.14
can I forget that

3073.8 --> 3078.48
it's like a form of State like not a

3076.14 --> 3079.14
religious state but a

3078.48 --> 3081.839
um

3079.14 --> 3085.4
type State associated with Western

3081.839 --> 3085.4
teaching what do you call that

3089.579 --> 3094.2000000000003
secular that's the one thank you round

3092.099 --> 3096.319
earth Observer

3094.2 --> 3099.18
right that's what I'm talking about

3096.319 --> 3100.2
secularization right

3099.18 --> 3103.6189999999997
and

3100.2 --> 3108.0589999999997
so yeah there is an advantage

3103.619 --> 3109.98
but it's just like allopathic medicine

3108.059 --> 3112.2000000000003
it might work on the short run

3109.98 --> 3113.579
brilliantly

3112.2 --> 3115.9199999999996
but

3113.579 --> 3118.619
there tend to rise unexpected

3115.92 --> 3122.0
complications that actually make things

3118.619 --> 3122.0
a lot worse in the long run

3128.03 --> 3135.6000000000004
[Music]

3135.96 --> 3138.079
okay

3138.839 --> 3146.54
how's the weather over here

3142.14 --> 3146.54
listen it's a bit cloudy now but

3149.4 --> 3154.19
we checked the temperature actually and

3151.38 --> 3157.239
haven't done that before today

3154.19 --> 3157.239
[Music]

3159.059 --> 3165.059
six degrees right six degrees Celsius so

3162.0 --> 3168.059
that's a bit of a rise

3165.059 --> 3168.059
foreign

3171.48 --> 3176.599
for a while

3172.859 --> 3176.5989999999997
so there's a temperature up

3177.42 --> 3181.28
up movement that's cool

3187.14 --> 3191.24
right anyway hope you guys are enjoying

3188.94 --> 3191.2400000000002
the show

3197.64 --> 3200.64
foreign

3207.33 --> 3210.5299999999997
[Music]

3228.0 --> 3233.48
seen him around in a while I think

3230.88 --> 3233.48
make sure

3258.68 --> 3266.66
all right hope you're enjoying the show

3261.0 --> 3266.66
so far please rogans it up already

3267.839 --> 3271.099
you might forget later

3280.8 --> 3286.8
right yeah yeah I remember I think

3284.52 --> 3288.359
I was confused at the time whether you

3286.8 --> 3291.98
were

3288.359 --> 3291.98
a global or not I think

3292.92 --> 3297.44
that you seem to be doing well

3299.64 --> 3307.2599999999998
it's a matter of perspective but I mean

3303.72 --> 3310.0789999999997
when it comes to doing this show and all

3307.26 --> 3312.0
that yeah my overall performance and

3310.079 --> 3314.3
yeah it's been

3312.0 --> 3317.04
a lot of likes

3314.3 --> 3319.02
self-analyzing and basically

3317.04 --> 3322.88
live

3319.02 --> 3322.88
reporting on what I'm doing

3322.98 --> 3329.78
on how to basically solve medical issues

3327.24 --> 3329.7799999999997
and all that

3330.059 --> 3335.6400000000003
so it's funny like back then you might

3333.599 --> 3340.1400000000003
have seen me with like

3335.64 --> 3344.42
face issues and all that skin issues

3340.14 --> 3344.42
and it was like drinking tumeric coffee

3344.88 --> 3350.099
and all yeah a lot of stuff well now

3347.94 --> 3352.619
everything's different like I don't I

3350.099 --> 3355.38
don't even don't drink green tea anymore

3352.619 --> 3357.7400000000002
even I don't drink coffee and I quit

3355.38 --> 3357.7400000000002
beer

3364.14 --> 3369.3799999999997
and yeah my skin has been a great

3367.14 --> 3369.3799999999997
condition

3370.38 --> 3373.4
really is

3373.5 --> 3378.78
so that's one thing and that yeah not

3376.859 --> 3381.2999999999997
just the skin I mean that's just like

3378.78 --> 3384.0
the if I get issues there that's just

3381.3 --> 3387.059
like the the peak of it like did the

3384.0 --> 3389.64
peak and nuisance of it but my overall

3387.059 --> 3391.8
system is just doing much better I mean

3389.64 --> 3395.2799999999997
last year even I still had while I was

3391.8 --> 3399.1800000000003
still drinking green tea and beer

3395.28 --> 3402.0
not at the same time anyway but

3399.18 --> 3404.22
I had a lot of gut issues where it just

3402.0 --> 3406.98
hurt tensions

3404.22 --> 3408.5589999999997
that's all gone away

3406.98 --> 3412.619
so I'm like

3408.559 --> 3414.42
openly figuring myself automatically

3412.619 --> 3417.359
and at the same time training

3414.42 --> 3419.04
psychological warfare repellent

3417.359 --> 3421.7599999999998
dealing with the trolls that never

3419.04 --> 3421.7599999999998
really go away

3428.28 --> 3432.119
not everyone has the discipline for

3430.26 --> 3434.42
self-improvement like that

3432.119 --> 3434.42
right

3439.74 --> 3446.22
well it's because

3442.2 --> 3449.04
for me it's not just discipline it's

3446.22 --> 3452.9599999999996
I'm kind of have an obsession with it if

3449.04 --> 3452.96
I can get my mindset to it

3454.26 --> 3461.0400000000004
so I do it pretty obsessively

3457.98 --> 3462.72
in in that sense

3461.04 --> 3465.42
like I

3462.72 --> 3468.0589999999997
because I don't really have yeah it's

3465.42 --> 3470.46
just my main project really like okay

3468.059 --> 3472.6400000000003
how can I improve myself so much that I

3470.46 --> 3472.64
can

3474.3 --> 3479.2200000000003
get out of this

3476.579 --> 3482.94
annoying position

3479.22 --> 3485.2799999999997
of being financially inept well I'm not

3482.94 --> 3489.079
inept I mean I'm not it's not a giant

3485.28 --> 3492.96
the disaster of debt and

3489.079 --> 3497.2400000000002
foreclosures and all that [ __ ] not that

3492.96 --> 3497.2400000000002
but just like not really

3499.8 --> 3504.42
having the proper funding to keep going

3502.319 --> 3508.579
normally

3504.42 --> 3508.579
right that's still an issue

3509.22 --> 3513.66
so I'm just trying to improve myself

3511.38 --> 3516.1800000000003
more and more and more so that at some

3513.66 --> 3520.0789999999997
point hopefully

3516.18 --> 3521.64
I'll get a good opportunity to really

3520.079 --> 3524.52
yeah

3521.64 --> 3526.92
stabilize my situation maybe even like

3524.52 --> 3529.559
get a wife and kids

3526.92 --> 3532.819
right that I that's really what I'm

3529.559 --> 3532.8190000000004
doing it for to be fair

3533.579 --> 3539.119
and probably when I have it I'll feel

3535.799 --> 3539.119
completely different about it

3539.579 --> 3546.619
but it's just like yeah it's like why

3543.359 --> 3546.619
else would I try

3555.24 --> 3559.2
other than I don't like to physically

3557.22 --> 3561.359
suffer I mean if I just didn't try

3559.2 --> 3563.22
anything I would just let become a slop

3561.359 --> 3567.799
yeah I would start to physically suffer

3563.22 --> 3567.799
under that so that's also a good reason

3568.5 --> 3573.54
but that's like default it's like just

3571.079 --> 3574.6800000000003
prevent from slipping Beyond a certain

3573.54 --> 3577.92
point

3574.68 --> 3582.44
right that's not really perfecting

3577.92 --> 3582.44
discipline that requires a goal

3584.28 --> 3589.2200000000003
a real driver

3586.68 --> 3589.22
anyway

3589.799 --> 3594.78
how many children is the idea or your

3592.14 --> 3597.319
opinion three

3594.78 --> 3597.3190000000004
really

3604.66 --> 3607.96
[Music]

3611.02 --> 3614.23
[Music]

3615.0 --> 3617.54
foreign

3618.0 --> 3624.119
but who knows if if you got the right

3621.66 --> 3626.8799999999997
combination

3624.119 --> 3631.079
if I had like the right type of woman

3626.88 --> 3634.88
like yeah it all depends you know

3631.079 --> 3634.88
it just depends like

3634.92 --> 3640.619
if it's like really working out and like

3638.22 --> 3644.0989999999997
every kid is like

3640.619 --> 3646.5
not just oh more more weight on our

3644.099 --> 3650.1600000000003
shoulders but like really palpably a

3646.5 --> 3653.96
blessing then I might go beyond that

3650.16 --> 3653.96
if my wife would accept that

3656.52 --> 3661.079
right if it's like whoa this is we we

3659.099 --> 3664.98
we're pumping out magical children

3661.079 --> 3667.799
though then I'd go like up to six or who

3664.98 --> 3670.52
knows maybe like 12 or something

3667.799 --> 3672.78
Naz probably not

3670.52 --> 3676.52
with one wife anyway

3672.78 --> 3679.92
uh but yeah

3676.52 --> 3684.319
let's let's just try to focus on

3679.92 --> 3687.98
actually getting to well a y first

3684.319 --> 3687.98
that would want children

3693.18 --> 3698.8799999999997
and not just oh

3695.22 --> 3703.0989999999997
sexy man on the side no thanks

3698.88 --> 3703.099
yeah done with that [ __ ]

sure they are they're not gonna be me

3751.38 --> 3754.04
okay

3765.299 --> 3769.98
I think I'm quite a unique combination

3767.88 --> 3773.6600000000003
like that I don't think they would turn

3769.98 --> 3773.66
into me I don't I doubt it

3775.44 --> 3783.92
well maybe if I had like a lot then some

3778.559 --> 3783.92
of them might but I just doubt it

3785.839 --> 3794.099
dude and hey if maybe it's like maybe

3790.319 --> 3796.98
who knows I don't know exactly

3794.099 --> 3801.5
what really my let's just say genetic

3796.98 --> 3801.5

3813.0 --> 3817.559
job first

3814.859 --> 3819.54
yeah well this is my job though it's

3817.559 --> 3821.1600000000003
just not really

3819.54 --> 3824.22
working

3821.16 --> 3827.3999999999996
to the degree that I yeah I could like

3824.22 --> 3830.14
have kids and all that and wife

3827.4 --> 3832.64
and that's really disappointing

3830.14 --> 3835.92
[Music]

3832.64 --> 3839.0589999999997
but hey maybe

3835.92 --> 3839.059
there's other ways

3841.26 --> 3845.2200000000003
and if this here doesn't pick up

3843.78 --> 3847.3190000000004
well enough

3845.22 --> 3850.5
then

3847.319 --> 3853.2
I will stop doing it this way

3850.5 --> 3855.48
I mean it's pretty cool and all

3853.2 --> 3859.9199999999996
a really weird show and yeah sure I'll

3855.48 --> 3862.14
definitely go to 1500 maybe even 2 000

3859.92 --> 3864.98
we'll see but

3862.14 --> 3864.98
maybe not

3867.18 --> 3871.04
because I can barely get by

3880.579 --> 3884.76
foreign

3882.42 --> 3888.119
but yeah I think that a lot of people

3884.76 --> 3890.7200000000003
are having that problem right now

3888.119 --> 3890.7200000000003
so

3890.94 --> 3896.88
I'm just gonna keep going

3893.46 --> 3899.2200000000003
and we'll see what happens and

3896.88 --> 3903.619
guess I'll just have to try to figure

3899.22 --> 3903.6189999999997
out how to manage somehow

hmm

4116.12 --> 4120.799
okay steam traveler but like how does

4118.58 --> 4124.219
that even work

4120.799 --> 4128.08
three jobs so it's like

4124.219 --> 4128.08
three part time I take it

4130.219 --> 4134.859
right well if you can arrange that

4132.44 --> 4134.8589999999995
somehow

4235.159 --> 4240.099999999999
it's an interesting concept I was demon

4237.44 --> 4240.099999999999
traveler I mean

4243.86 --> 4246.94
repeat that

4247.34 --> 4252.8
maybe if I had like

4250.219 --> 4254.06
different types of jobs very different

4252.8 --> 4256.6990000000005
types

4254.06 --> 4258.26
that would basically follow each other

4256.699 --> 4261.0199999999995
up

4258.26 --> 4263.4800000000005
like over the course of a week

4261.02 --> 4266.659000000001
that might actually prevent me from

4263.48 --> 4268.58
getting extremely bored

4266.659 --> 4270.799999999999
like what happened in the past when you

4268.58 --> 4274.239
just have one type of job and you do

4270.8 --> 4274.2390000000005
that like a week

4274.4 --> 4280.9
get on your nerves on my nerves at least

4277.4 --> 4280.9
so yeah maybe

4285.02 --> 4289.159000000001
I could approach it differently next

4288.02 --> 4291.1990000000005
time

4289.159 --> 4293.719
there's going to be a next time anytime

4291.199 --> 4296.48
soon anyway we'll see

4293.719 --> 4299.0
I kind of like to continue doing this

4296.48 --> 4301.58
and getting somewhere

4299.0 --> 4303.82
and maybe I have to switch platforms or

4301.58 --> 4303.82
something

4306.62 --> 4312.739
or maybe reinvent myself even though I'm

4310.699 --> 4315.94
that's basically what I'm trying to do

4312.739 --> 4315.94
continually so

4318.26 --> 4323.0
are you guys like getting bored with the

4321.02 --> 4325.540000000001
background and everything should I

4323.0 --> 4325.54
change something

4327.199 --> 4333.699
should I nag adamekin again about that

4329.9 --> 4333.699
or something I don't know

4335.66 --> 4338.8589999999995
[Music]

4339.26 --> 4344.8
I almost forgot by the way but I do have

4341.54 --> 4344.8
a different type of background

4352.58 --> 4358.54
but it still works

4355.64 --> 4358.54
that's it

4360.08 --> 4366.129
yeah it still works

4363.01 --> 4366.129
[Music]

4366.38 --> 4369.52
did you forget that

4370.48 --> 4374.799999999999
I forgot it I shouldn't

4376.76 --> 4382.9400000000005
it's just that I usually just get too

4379.159 --> 4385.82
focused on just my thoughts and the chat

4382.94 --> 4388.339999999999
in in relation I spend very little time

4385.82 --> 4390.32
on just like what people are actually

4388.34 --> 4395.02
going to be looking at

4390.32 --> 4395.0199999999995
except for my own personal gestures

4433.04 --> 4439.84
right anyhow

4435.92 --> 4439.84
was watching on Benjamin again

4441.8 --> 4446.38
it's having some really great streams

4443.96 --> 4446.38
recently

4481.46 --> 4489.64
I'm wondering sometimes like

4485.239 --> 4489.639999999999
would they allow me on their platform

4490.219 --> 4495.38
like over at uh on authorize.tv

4495.8 --> 4500.06
I've been thinking about basically

4497.9 --> 4503.36
getting a membership there even though

4500.06 --> 4506.92
yeah I can't really pay for that

4503.36 --> 4506.92
less even

4509.3 --> 4512.719
because it's a pretty good place to be I

4511.4 --> 4515.36
could be

4512.719 --> 4518.3
well verbally like

4515.36 --> 4521.659
extremely free there

4518.3 --> 4524.78
but I wonder if yeah if I do that if

4521.659 --> 4526.46
then YouTube would just delete all of

4524.78 --> 4528.5599999999995
this

4526.46 --> 4530.86
might still have the Odyssey backup

4528.56 --> 4530.860000000001
though

4540.679 --> 4546.9800000000005
all right but anyway

4543.62 --> 4549.62
I I don't necessarily even need to like

4546.98 --> 4552.86
oh I need to go to Old Benjamin's

4549.62 --> 4555.199
platform because I can't speak my mind

4552.86 --> 4557.36
here now I can I've pretty much figured

4555.199 --> 4559.78
out a way to still be able to speak my

4557.36 --> 4559.78
mind here

4561.5 --> 4566.96
right you just figure out a good way to

4564.56 --> 4569.900000000001
describe the thing that you're not

4566.96 --> 4572.2390000000005
supposed to talk about so that you don't

4569.9 --> 4574.46
you like hint at it

4572.239 --> 4576.678999999999
in a way that's understandable for

4574.46 --> 4579.04
people that actually know anything about

4576.679 --> 4579.04
anything

4579.86 --> 4584.299999999999
and then you can still talk about it

4581.6 --> 4586.58
without using the trigger words

4584.3 --> 4588.26
it works great I mean I have no problem

4586.58 --> 4591.08
with that it's just like yeah oh people

4588.26 --> 4594.679
yeah are suffering

4591.08 --> 4597.14
like having all kinds of issues with

4594.679 --> 4601.04
because of the medical experimentation

4597.14 --> 4603.08
right I mean oh

4601.04 --> 4605.42
yeah what are you gonna do

4603.08 --> 4607.719
what you're gonna talk you're gonna flag

4605.42 --> 4611.42
me for saying the words medical

4607.719 --> 4614.179
experimentation wow that's gonna be

4611.42 --> 4617.54
problematic

4614.179 --> 4621.62
to like an entire field

4617.54 --> 4626.08
of research out there and all that right

4621.62 --> 4626.08
so it I don't even need that

4627.44 --> 4631.879999999999
but I do kind of want the connectivity I

4629.9 --> 4636.339999999999
want yeah

4631.88 --> 4636.34
I wish it just could get more attention

4637.4 --> 4643.12
not experimentation the [ __ ] are you

4640.64 --> 4643.12
talking about

4651.219 --> 4658.03

5012.699 --> 5017.259999999999
because that was the main subject pretty

5015.219 --> 5020.04
much

5017.26 --> 5020.04
that's it

5050.33 --> 5053.439
[Music]

5056.26 --> 5060.0
a devil's advocate

5065.739 --> 5069.959999999999
your dad known flutter sure man

5079.06 --> 5082.6
you're just not a dick about yeah we'll

5081.1 --> 5085.4400000000005
see

5082.6 --> 5085.4400000000005
uh-huh

5089.65 --> 5092.8099999999995
[Music]

5098.52 --> 5103.900000000001
[Music]

5101.14 --> 5106.8
right just know that if I'm gonna get

5103.9 --> 5110.28
you one that Sunday

5106.8 --> 5113.679
I don't want to talk about

5110.28 --> 5116.0199999999995
expanding the show

5113.679 --> 5119.32
yeah

5116.02 --> 5121.659000000001
I want to talk about actual subjects a

5119.32 --> 5124.179
subject not about oh how do we improve

5121.659 --> 5126.5199999999995
the our wind show so I can hear listen

5124.179 --> 5128.76
to you like endless suggestions or

5126.52 --> 5128.76
something

5129.88 --> 5134.9800000000005
while then I would then constantly have

5133.06 --> 5136.4800000000005
to tell you like yeah that doesn't work

5134.98 --> 5137.32
that doesn't work yet don't want to do

5136.48 --> 5140.099999999999
that

5137.32 --> 5144.159
so let's actually talk about something

5140.1 --> 5147.179
other than my show

5144.159 --> 5147.179
how about that

5147.28 --> 5151.239
because you seem to love the gift

5149.38 --> 5155.1990000000005
suggestions

5151.239 --> 5159.638999999999
about it well I don't want that in

5155.199 --> 5161.919999999999
the actual Sunday show

5159.639 --> 5165.82
can you do that or is that the reason

5161.92 --> 5167.62
you want to go on I hope not

5165.82 --> 5169.799999999999
I hope you have other things to talk

5167.62 --> 5169.8
about

5177.52 --> 5180.9400000000005
should we come up with a topic

5179.08 --> 5183.219
beforehand well yeah that would be great

5180.94 --> 5186.719
dude you should come up with a topic

5183.219 --> 5186.719
when you join my chat

5188.5 --> 5196.78
I should start my show with

5192.82 --> 5198.94
with the topic but sometimes it just

5196.78 --> 5201.699
can't find one that is actually has a

5198.94 --> 5203.62
point in the past even I would like have

5201.699 --> 5205.54
a little title and then it just nothing

5203.62 --> 5208.239
would happen with it I would just erase

5205.54 --> 5210.04
it and change it right

5208.239 --> 5212.08
so

5210.04 --> 5215.38
for me

5212.08 --> 5217.6
yeah my topics are not always sure like

5215.38 --> 5219.639
how deep I can dive into them sometimes

5217.6 --> 5221.7390000000005
it's just like I run through them in

5219.639 --> 5223.900000000001
like 10 minutes five minutes and it's

5221.739 --> 5227.5
done

5223.9 --> 5231.219
and then unless people really dive into

5227.5 --> 5233.5
that as a response in the chat then

5231.219 --> 5236.62
there's things I can elaborate on but

5233.5 --> 5240.9
that doesn't really seem to happen a lot

5236.62 --> 5240.9
happens with certain subjects

5242.38 --> 5244.86
but

5249.219 --> 5255.52
yeah not definitely not all of them

5251.98 --> 5258.28
right but yeah if you're gonna come on a

5255.52 --> 5261.76
panel with me with your voice

5258.28 --> 5263.08
then yeah it would be great if you had a

5261.76 --> 5267.219
subject

5263.08 --> 5269.139
to talk about otherwise it's just like

5267.219 --> 5272.04
there's going to be awkward silences

5269.139 --> 5272.04
otherwise probably

5273.1 --> 5279.46
or I will just start dragging in things

5277.26 --> 5282.76
but then if you don't know anything

5279.46 --> 5285.28
about it then yeah those subjects

5282.76 --> 5287.139
attempt will just get discarded one by

5285.28 --> 5289.78
one so

5287.139 --> 5291.639
right I mean if there's really like

5289.78 --> 5293.5
nothing else to talk about I'll just

5291.639 --> 5295.78
probably pull

5293.5 --> 5298.719
my Rudolph Steiner book

5295.78 --> 5300.9
out and start talking about that or

5298.719 --> 5300.9
something

5301.3 --> 5305.5
I've been thinking about doing that like

5303.639 --> 5307.900000000001
I could for example have a little micro

5305.5 --> 5310.84
challenge there and live translate it

5307.9 --> 5314.86
because it's in Dutch

5310.84 --> 5317.5
and it's highly esoteric so that would

5314.86 --> 5319.299999999999
be an actual serious life translation

5317.5 --> 5321.159
challenge

5319.3 --> 5324.1
to read it and then immediately

5321.159 --> 5326.759999999999
translate it to English like including

5324.1 --> 5329.5
the esoterics

5326.76 --> 5332.9400000000005
right I might bump into words that I

5329.5 --> 5332.94
just don't even know what they mean

5336.52 --> 5340.96
that's something I could do at some

5338.92 --> 5343.26
point I'd have to be really in the mood

5340.96 --> 5343.26
though

5345.04 --> 5350.199
it would be great if I attempted that to

5347.739 --> 5353.44
actually pre-read a bit so I'd already

5350.199 --> 5357.419999999999
get into it so it wouldn't have like a

5353.44 --> 5357.419999999999
slow start doing it

5358.719 --> 5363.94
right so yeah but this Sunday

5361.239 --> 5366.099999999999
's Moretz is gonna come on and we'll

5363.94 --> 5368.879999999999
talk about something

5366.1 --> 5368.88
we'll see

5374.56 --> 5378.900000000001
little man like me what are you talking

5376.659 --> 5378.9
about

5387.94 --> 5393.46
oh wait you're talking the devil staff

5389.98 --> 5396.12
again okay right uh

5393.46 --> 5396.12
foreign

5415.98 --> 5420.159
I gotta have to figure out I'm gonna

5418.36 --> 5422.5
have to figure out something by the way

5420.159 --> 5426.5199999999995
to even

5422.5 --> 5429.46
have like visuals because

5426.52 --> 5430.659000000001
maybe it's yeah probably Gonna Keep It

5429.46 --> 5433.84
voice only

5430.659 --> 5435.759999999999
for anybody that calls in

5433.84 --> 5440.08
and I really hope the sound actually

5435.76 --> 5444.34
works out in the past it's had like meh

5440.08 --> 5447.1
quality and sometimes Echo issues so

5444.34 --> 5449.4400000000005
I hope that works out otherwise I might

5447.1 --> 5452.02
have to like

5449.44 --> 5454.799999999999
try another type of interface

5452.02 --> 5454.8
somehow

5461.98 --> 5469.678999999999
maybe I could like try element like flat

5464.86 --> 5469.679
side uses seems to work very easily

5475.719 --> 5481.139
I have to think about that maybe I'll

5478.239 --> 5481.138999999999
I'll set that up

5481.84 --> 5485.9400000000005
I think I already have it installed and

5483.76 --> 5485.9400000000005
everything

5487.54 --> 5491.26
anyway

5489.52 --> 5493.4400000000005
yeah that could be interesting this

5491.26 --> 5493.4400000000005
Sunday

5494.8 --> 5501.05
[Music]

5520.239 --> 5523.44
right anyway I hope you guys are

5522.1 --> 5526.719
enjoying the show

5523.44 --> 5529.259999999999
I thought it was interesting

5526.719 --> 5529.26
right

5536.51 --> 5542.1
[Music]

5538.06 --> 5542.1
looking forward to flatter debates

5550.9 --> 5556.0199999999995
uh right out of T this keeps happening

5556.12 --> 5559.96
[Music]

5558.04 --> 5563.08
it's funny

5559.96 --> 5565.54
also like it cools down so much quicker

5563.08 --> 5568.42
than green tea that's something I'm also

5565.54 --> 5573.719
noticing like why is that

5568.42 --> 5573.719
like it literally cools down quicker

5573.82 --> 5580.0199999999995
like how does that even work

5576.97 --> 5580.02
[Music]

5610.12 --> 5616.659
cooling effect of me yeah but that's

5613.719 --> 5620.08
I know right but that's like a sensation

5616.659 --> 5621.159
but the minty literally cools down

5620.08 --> 5624.3
faster

5621.159 --> 5624.299999999999
than the green tea

5627.82 --> 5632.32
it's really weird

5629.86 --> 5634.719
or maybe it's just I noticed the

5632.32 --> 5637.86
temperature better

5634.719 --> 5640.9
or something like that

5637.86 --> 5642.699
then the green tea the taste of it might

5640.9 --> 5644.199
be distracting from the temperature I

5642.699 --> 5646.239
don't know what it is but it just seems

5644.199 --> 5648.5199999999995
like it cools down quicker and I drink

5646.239 --> 5652.0199999999995
more of it which is also an indicator

5648.52 --> 5652.02
that a because

5653.02 --> 5658.38
I usually drink quicker when it's cooler

5663.1 --> 5666.4800000000005
you know what you said right

5667.78 --> 5672.78
you know

5669.28 --> 5672.78
a little Nature Boy

5673.55 --> 5679.37
[Music]

5685.719 --> 5691.0
can I say it's slightly weird to

5688.84 --> 5694.3
have a picture of somebody that's

5691.0 --> 5697.5
clearly not super young anymore calling

5694.3 --> 5697.5
themselves boy but

5700.239 --> 5708.178999999999
it's probably like a thing to you so

5704.52 --> 5708.179
welcome to my chat

5711.219 --> 5716.58
fresh ginger tea onions okay

5721.48 --> 5730.5
yeah that that sounds like uh very good

5724.84 --> 5730.5
against like cold and flu stats Moretz

5730.9 --> 5737.5199999999995
whatever I've grown your own mint

5734.139 --> 5737.52
yeah sure

5740.32 --> 5744.82
but I'd have to actually have a garden

5742.54 --> 5747.58
but yeah that is a pretty good idea

5744.82 --> 5749.5599999999995
because mint does grow much easier

5747.58 --> 5753.76
than green tea

5749.56 --> 5755.8
so I that's a funny thing yeah

5753.76 --> 5758.08
if I'd have a bit of garden space I

5755.8 --> 5759.6990000000005
could grow like tons of men and even get

5758.08 --> 5762.28
it fresh

5759.699 --> 5764.08
that's interesting

5762.28 --> 5767.62
right but I don't really have the room

5764.08 --> 5767.62
for that so

5773.5 --> 5780.84
and I mean this minty is pretty good

5777.219 --> 5780.84
I'm very satisfied with it

5788.56 --> 5795.1
it could be a non-fe I guess okay metal

5792.159 --> 5798.719
select well stats Moretz isn't a flat

5795.1 --> 5798.719
Earth so it's already there

5798.88 --> 5804.42
all right now all the Ballers just want

5801.04 --> 5804.42
to get on here what is this

5818.26 --> 5820.860000000001
foreign

5822.659 --> 5829.9
actually become a man well any boy

5827.139 --> 5832.179
should stop wanting to call themselves

5829.9 --> 5835.12
boy at least

5832.179 --> 5839.5
after 12.

5835.12 --> 5844.84
unless you're gay just saying

5839.5 --> 5848.92
or just don't feel that I did I didn't

5844.84 --> 5851.1990000000005
want to be called boy anymore after 12.

5848.92 --> 5854.32
I mean people would still do that but

5851.199 --> 5855.699
then it it became an insult

5854.32 --> 5858.41
to me

5855.699 --> 5861.648999999999
to my pride right

5858.41 --> 5861.648999999999
[Music]

5862.0 --> 5868.78
a Ric Flair professional wrestler

5865.239 --> 5870.58
nicknamed Nature Boy okay

5868.78 --> 5872.98
huh

5870.58 --> 5874.239
right so it is a like a specific

5872.98 --> 5876.4
nickname

5874.239 --> 5880.599999999999
okay

5876.4 --> 5882.299999999999
right but are you Nick Flair though Rick

5880.6 --> 5886.3
Flair

5882.3 --> 5886.3
28 okay

5887.86 --> 5893.62
that's weird though why would you take

5890.08 --> 5898.26
the identity of somebody

5893.62 --> 5898.26
else like that that's really weird

5929.86 --> 5935.46
cheers there okay you're just a fan okay

5932.679 --> 5935.46
fine

5936.159 --> 5941.58
oh I'll stop uh questioning about it

5954.159 --> 5958.96
and Crow's large needs yeah I know

5956.679 --> 5960.76
that's why I said it's not gonna work

5958.96 --> 5963.76
with my setup here

5960.76 --> 5966.400000000001
but if I were ever to change a location

5963.76 --> 5968.1990000000005
or something and get a garden yeah a

5966.4 --> 5969.94
mint will be

5968.199 --> 5972.219
one of the herbs that I'll grow

5969.94 --> 5974.5
definitely now

5972.219 --> 5977.5
besides basil

5974.5 --> 5977.5
oregano

5977.56 --> 5982.6
and some other things

5980.26 --> 5986.320000000001
I probably tried to like

5982.6 --> 5987.820000000001
eventually move to like growing all my

5986.32 --> 5992.199
own herbs

5987.82 --> 5994.719
like maybe try garlic and onions and

5992.199 --> 5998.759999999999
and of course tomatoes

5994.719 --> 5998.76
and I yeah I've done that before

6004.139 --> 6009.900000000001
mint pretty much bomb proof right

6007.32 --> 6012.44
yeah so that's an interesting you could

6009.9 --> 6012.44
just like

6013.679 --> 6017.52
just take some patch of pretty good

6015.719 --> 6021.139
ground and just throw the seeds there

6017.52 --> 6021.139
and it will be all mint

6025.02 --> 6028.400000000001
yeah interesting idea

6032.159 --> 6037.5599999999995
right I've never really been into mint

6034.38 --> 6040.08
tea before I mean I would sometimes

6037.56 --> 6042.96
but I mostly got minty like

6040.08 --> 6045.12
oh my stomach is not feeling great or

6042.96 --> 6047.219
I've been sick or something

6045.12 --> 6049.699
then I get it and it's like pretty

6047.219 --> 6049.699
soothing

6050.1 --> 6055.26
but yeah now I'm drinking it standard so

6052.38 --> 6057.0
now it's like oh hmm yeah you can

6055.26 --> 6059.179
actually grow that never thought of that

6057.0 --> 6059.179
before

6073.56 --> 6080.06
how to be gum how to spearmint plant

6077.28 --> 6080.0599999999995
okay

6081.48 --> 6087.0199999999995
well I think you have to actually add

6083.699 --> 6087.0199999999995
the gum components

6087.06 --> 6093.1990000000005
but you can't just like take spearmint

6089.4 --> 6093.199
and then concentrate it

6094.92 --> 6099.119
you can literally juice it

6097.739 --> 6101.699
right

6099.119 --> 6103.5
just squeeze the juice out of it machine

6101.699 --> 6107.04
wise and just have concentrated

6103.5 --> 6109.139
spearmint juice and then yeah you could

6107.04 --> 6111.6
let that dry get it even more

6109.139 --> 6115.159000000001
concentrated

6111.6 --> 6115.159000000001
or just yeah

6116.04 --> 6120.139
