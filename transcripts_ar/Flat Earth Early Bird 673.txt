74.96 --> 79.19999999999999
so sunday

79.28 --> 84.08
i started on time for change two minutes

82.32 --> 86.88
early

84.08 --> 89.28
and yeah the weather outside is it's

86.88 --> 91.28
still cloudy

89.28 --> 92.64
like the entire night there was just

91.28 --> 96.0
this continuous

92.64 --> 99.36
storm going on like really hard winds

96.0 --> 101.759
with a lot of rain and yeah it was a

99.36 --> 104.32
weird situation because

101.759 --> 106.799
because the unusual wind strength

104.32 --> 110.88
combined with the rain

106.799 --> 113.52000000000001
like one of the uh the pipes

110.88 --> 114.399
the yeah the one of the net yeah this is

113.52 --> 116.96
it the passive

114.399 --> 117.759
vents in the kitchen was actually

116.96 --> 122.0
leaking

117.759 --> 125.759
it was water blowing in from the side

122.0 --> 128.479
in yeah into the kitchen so i had to

125.759 --> 130.319
like create this temporary artificial

128.479 --> 134.08
waterfall

130.319 --> 135.11999999999998
thing yeah i had to build this pathway

134.08 --> 136.64000000000001
for the leak

135.12 --> 138.879
because i couldn't stop it i couldn't

136.64 --> 141.83999999999997
cork it

138.879 --> 143.35999999999999
it was weird so i just had to make sure

141.84 --> 145.599
that like it wouldn't run

143.36 --> 147.28
off to the sides and all that and just

145.599 --> 150.319
go straight into the

147.28 --> 152.48
into the drain because the leak

150.319 --> 154.23899999999998
was even though was coming from the

152.48 --> 156.23899999999998
ceiling pretty close to that so

154.239 --> 158.959
this had to create this construction and

156.239 --> 158.959
it kind of worked

159.2 --> 164.39999999999998
but anyway where is everyone

166.0 --> 171.84
this is unusual

175.76 --> 183.92
all right anyway i got

181.12 --> 185.36
to mara coffee with me this is actually

183.92 --> 187.35999999999999
my morning coffee

185.36 --> 189.20000000000002
because i got up really late half an

187.36 --> 190.08
hour before the show started i'm very

189.2 --> 193.44
proud that i'm

190.08 --> 197.28
able to be on time even though i

193.44 --> 201.04
got up not even half an hour ago

197.28 --> 204.08
hey m1 bear v2

201.04 --> 208.79899999999998
good morning rand m

204.08 --> 208.799
very late youtube announcement okay

211.44 --> 215.28
all right anyway good to see you

219.519 --> 222.87900000000002
yeah yesterday was just

224.959 --> 232.0
the combination of me now sort of

228.159 --> 234.07999999999998
yeah migrating back to a night rhythm

232.0 --> 235.76
which i have natural tendencies to do

234.08 --> 238.799
that even though it's not too healthy

235.76 --> 241.2
actually giving into that but yeah

238.799 --> 242.4
that in combination with just yesterday

241.2 --> 247.51899999999998
night was just so

242.4 --> 247.519
filled with just really good streams

248.48 --> 250.72
uh

251.92 --> 261.199
right so yeah yesterday

256.0 --> 261.199
ball busters live i was on there

262.88 --> 267.68
and yeah i thought uh i i did pretty

266.16 --> 269.759
good

267.68 --> 271.759
although yeah eventually you know when

269.759 --> 273.68
they just

271.759 --> 275.84000000000003
this is the thing this is also about the

273.68 --> 277.759
school model is when you just take a

275.84 --> 280.23999999999995
specific

277.759 --> 280.96000000000004
formula of approach and then just name

280.24 --> 283.68
every

280.96 --> 286.15999999999997
thing that is in the list of that thing

283.68 --> 288.72
universally like everything

286.16 --> 290.88000000000005
and then when that list is very long

288.72 --> 291.84000000000003
then eventually i start to get like

290.88 --> 295.44
concentration

291.84 --> 297.19899999999996
problems it's like my adhd

295.44 --> 298.96
sort of whatever that's supposed to be

297.199 --> 302.32
starts to play up and i get like

298.96 --> 303.68
either tired out and i have to like keep

302.32 --> 305.84
my eyes open

303.68 --> 307.12
or i just get distracted like i want to

305.84 --> 309.19899999999996
do something else

307.12 --> 311.68
and that did start to happen eventually

309.199 --> 315.52000000000004
like it did get a bit of a headache

311.68 --> 317.919
so it lost track like at last

315.52 --> 318.56
half an hour 15 minutes i think people

317.919 --> 321.68
noticed

318.56 --> 324.639
hey but first part i did great i thought

321.68 --> 326.639
even though kiwi like said are you drunk

324.639 --> 329.759
like three times thanks kiwi

326.639 --> 329.759
no i wasn't drunk

330.639 --> 338.72
but uh whatever hey glass shaw

334.32 --> 342.24
rob keane good to see you

338.72 --> 347.03900000000004
i think rob keane was in the discord

342.24 --> 349.12
too you're the guy that super chats

347.039 --> 350.4
you want to be unmuted and then when

349.12 --> 352.639
you're unmuted you say

350.4 --> 354.71999999999997
you have nothing to say right that's

352.639 --> 357.039
that was a running joke i just got that

354.72 --> 362.16
yesterday

357.039 --> 362.15999999999997
hey own a plane good to see you

363.039 --> 366.479
and when the ball busters would was

364.96 --> 368.4
quite intense

366.479 --> 369.59999999999997
pointing out all the fallacies all of

368.4 --> 373.19899999999996
them and it's

369.6 --> 376.47900000000004
really complicated you know

373.199 --> 379.12
to me pointing out fallacies

376.479 --> 380.71999999999997
now hey thank you for the five canadian

379.12 --> 382.24
dollar super chat the nation rocking

380.72 --> 384.56
thank you very much

382.24 --> 386.72
but yeah pointing out fallacies in in

384.56 --> 388.08
like baller arguments which is where we

386.72 --> 391.03900000000004
find them the most

388.08 --> 391.039
as we all know

392.0 --> 396.639
it's not even like it's this fallacy

394.639 --> 400.16
it's not even that simple it's like

396.639 --> 402.8
every time they just present like jewels

400.16 --> 404.639
and every specific cut of the of the

402.8 --> 407.68
jewel of the gem

404.639 --> 411.44
is another fallacy so it's like a whole

407.68 --> 412.56
framework of like a crystal of fallacies

411.44 --> 414.639
usually

412.56 --> 416.56
and that even became more apparent when

414.639 --> 418.96000000000004
we started to discuss

416.56 --> 421.28000000000003
specific type of arguments we have been

418.96 --> 423.28
presented with as flat earthers

421.28 --> 425.599
like yeah it's this fallacy and that one

423.28 --> 429.19899999999996
and that one and that one

425.599 --> 431.28
then it turns out that in reality it's

429.199 --> 434.16
a little bit more complex than you just

431.28 --> 437.84
point out a single fallacy

434.16 --> 437.84000000000003
but it's just so tough

437.93 --> 440.999
[Music]

441.759 --> 448.24
yeah it reminds me in complexity of uh

445.199 --> 450.0
the discipline that i learned in biology

448.24 --> 453.36
was never too great at it never

450.0 --> 456.639
had the patience for it i don't know

453.36 --> 459.44
how do you call it in english

456.639 --> 462.40000000000003
determining not dissecting but yeah

459.44 --> 465.52
dissecting without cutting things apart

462.4 --> 469.599
every element of it of a plant

465.52 --> 474.15999999999997
to figure out what type of plant it is

469.599 --> 475.68
like like basically every geometrical

474.16 --> 479.03900000000004
element you like

475.68 --> 481.36
determinate plants

479.039 --> 483.36
like as they are crystal formation like

481.36 --> 486.639
exactly the type of leaf

483.36 --> 487.52000000000004
the length versus the width like how the

486.639 --> 488.96000000000004
grains are

487.52 --> 491.19899999999996
are they emphasized are they not

488.96 --> 492.63899999999995
emphasized are they slanted or are they

491.199 --> 495.599
straight you know

492.639 --> 497.68
and then the entire freaking thing

495.599 --> 499.199
that's also a discipline and that kind

497.68 --> 501.52
of reminds me of

499.199 --> 503.68
pointing out fallacies in failed

501.52 --> 506.08
arguments

503.68 --> 509.599
because that in reality also turns out

506.08 --> 512.7189999999999
to be quite complicated and extensive

509.599 --> 514.959
so it's not just oh you quickly and

512.719 --> 517.519
it's not something i've been able to

514.959 --> 519.919
just let my intuition do

517.519 --> 523.039
take over easily see because if it's

519.919 --> 527.04
very simple my intuition

523.039 --> 535.8389999999999
assimilates it usually very quickly

527.04 --> 535.8389999999999
hey let me scan

537.04 --> 540.24
it's been interesting lately in the

538.72 --> 541.519
letter of the community

540.24 --> 544.32
yeah of course there's plenty of

541.519 --> 544.32
interesting things

547.6 --> 554.72
it really does feel almost to me

551.68 --> 557.92
romanticize it a little

554.72 --> 560.88
it does feel to me in my own way like

557.92 --> 562.7199999999999
as flat earth i really try to be the tip

560.88 --> 565.36
of the spear

562.72 --> 566.8000000000001
and it's like i'm and with flat earth

565.36 --> 569.6
also

566.8 --> 570.16
try to be like the tip of the spear with

569.6 --> 573.0400000000001
in all

570.16 --> 573.36
fields in a way because this is what i

573.04 --> 576.64
do

573.36 --> 578.399
i just look what everybody's doing where

576.64 --> 579.36
they're shining their torches of

578.399 --> 582.959
consciousness

579.36 --> 584.9590000000001
and then just pushing it but pushing it

582.959 --> 587.68
guided by principle and like this

584.959 --> 590.88
spiritual universal direction

587.68 --> 594.8
that's very etheric

590.88 --> 598.959
just to always push it further and just

594.8 --> 602.16
find that way through look where

598.959 --> 606.4799999999999
others haven't looked before

602.16 --> 609.519
but take it just as serious

606.48 --> 611.519
as the absolute real thing

609.519 --> 612.72
when you do that when you presuppose be

611.519 --> 614.64
very serious

612.72 --> 616.839
because a lot of people this is the

614.64 --> 619.4399999999999
weird trick this is like the ego

616.839 --> 623.6
interaction a lot of people

619.44 --> 626.32
when they start imagining

623.6 --> 627.36
their construction of how it could be

626.32 --> 630.5600000000001
most people

627.36 --> 633.6800000000001
have strong tendencies to then

630.56 --> 634.8
make it like their private legos or

633.68 --> 637.1999999999999
something

634.8 --> 638.3199999999999
and to be much more liberal towards

637.2 --> 641.36
themselves

638.32 --> 643.6800000000001
with the limitations see because it's

641.36 --> 647.519
their fantasies their construction

643.68 --> 650.88
it's very tough for people that do that

647.519 --> 652.32
to be super strict and reason really use

650.88 --> 655.36
it almost like a

652.32 --> 657.6
like a holographic computer

655.36 --> 659.2
to truly represent something and they

657.6 --> 662.0
just

659.2 --> 664.24
like their their construct their

662.0 --> 665.44
patterns that they've seen and like are

664.24 --> 668.399
in awe of it

665.44 --> 669.36
and then they can't let go of it even

668.399 --> 672.079
though

669.36 --> 673.44
how i figured out these typical things

672.079 --> 675.1999999999999
that you come across because that

673.44 --> 676.72
happened all my life and you do

675.2 --> 678.88
want to hold on to them because they

676.72 --> 680.5600000000001
just made such an impression on you and

678.88 --> 683.519
you think you can do so much with it

680.56 --> 685.76
it shows you the vast structure of of

683.519 --> 689.12
everything and how it's interconnected

685.76 --> 692.3199999999999
right but in reality these are not

689.12 --> 695.92
things to hold on to they're almost like

692.32 --> 696.72
like little lightning flashes they just

695.92 --> 699.519
happen

696.72 --> 700.32
and it's more about knowing that that

699.519 --> 704.8
happens

700.32 --> 706.6400000000001
and that it is revealed in those moments

704.8 --> 707.92
letting go is actually quite important

706.64 --> 711.4399999999999
because when you do that

707.92 --> 714.16
then it will also return

711.44 --> 716.0790000000001
if you hold on to it it'll actually

714.16 --> 718.24
slowly die down and then you'll just

716.079 --> 719.8389999999999
have the memories of those specific

718.24 --> 721.36
moments that you're holding on to yeah

719.839 --> 725.519
this is all very esoteric

721.36 --> 727.2
ethereal i know but this is how it works

725.519 --> 730.32
and a lot of people have trouble with

727.2 --> 732.48
that i have a strong built-in discipline

730.32 --> 735.7600000000001
to let it go and it's also tied in with

732.48 --> 735.76
like a going about of

736.24 --> 740.16
realizing that technically you can't

739.6 --> 743.44
forget

740.16 --> 745.68
things it's even problematic when you

743.44 --> 748.1600000000001
think about it how badly

745.68 --> 749.519
people are in really forgetting things

748.16 --> 752.7199999999999
but

749.519 --> 754.639
things do get like out of reach

752.72 --> 756.839
but it has to do with your spirit and

754.639 --> 761.12
how it is

756.839 --> 761.12
interacting with the memory

761.2 --> 766.399
but everything is there like even in

764.639 --> 767.36
moments where you're seemingly like

766.399 --> 770.88
completely

767.36 --> 773.92
in your own imagination it's still

770.88 --> 774.48
recorded it's just a bit more of a

773.92 --> 776.88
puzzle

774.48 --> 778.32
to find it back and this is also like

776.88 --> 781.36
how hypnosis

778.32 --> 783.839
has been used to get

781.36 --> 785.6
back into memories that you don't

783.839 --> 788.48
consciously remember anymore in that

785.6 --> 788.9590000000001
see because you can't forget things well

788.48 --> 791.519
if you

788.959 --> 793.5999999999999
really know that if you really live with

791.519 --> 794.24
that knowledge if you really adapt to

793.6 --> 798.24
that

794.24 --> 800.5600000000001
consciously then you can have

798.24 --> 802.24
the the same thing with those unique

800.56 --> 804.7199999999999
moments those unique structures you

802.24 --> 808.32
recognize you want to hold on to

804.72 --> 808.32
you have it with all

808.399 --> 814.079
things and then

812.32 --> 815.519
if you get there then you can do what i

814.079 --> 819.04
do and that is

815.519 --> 822.72
make it fully autopilot don't

819.04 --> 825.8389999999999
burden your actual in the moment

822.72 --> 830.8000000000001
conscious with how to do

825.839 --> 834.1600000000001
things you just feel the frequency

830.8 --> 836.3199999999999
and then you go based on

834.16 --> 838.48
your response to the frequency and the

836.32 --> 840.48
rest is fully automated and it's all

838.48 --> 842.48
comprised of everything that has been

840.48 --> 846.5600000000001
done and said

842.48 --> 848.88
and because i've taken life so serious

846.56 --> 850.88
and used every opportunity as a learning

848.88 --> 853.8389999999999
moment including the failures

850.88 --> 855.4399999999999
when in the moment itself for the ego

853.839 --> 857.0400000000001
there was very little reward because i

855.44 --> 858.8000000000001
was just incompetent and i couldn't get

857.04 --> 862.3199999999999
anything out of it

858.8 --> 866.16
i knew that if i take it serious

862.32 --> 869.519
then it will sink in and it will be used

866.16 --> 872.959
by my my true intelligence

869.519 --> 876.399
to create this

872.959 --> 879.3599999999999
auto structure of doing it's

876.399 --> 882.24
you see yeah it's this must sound very

879.36 --> 885.44
unusual to a lot of people

882.24 --> 886.399
but this is why i can improvise so well

885.44 --> 890.0790000000001
i kind of

886.399 --> 893.92
saw this i foresaw this of myself i

890.079 --> 896.88
knew that i would have amazing abilities

893.92 --> 899.4399999999999
but at first it was really my conscious

896.88 --> 904.399
wanting to latch onto it wanting to do

899.44 --> 906.8000000000001
it consciously that made me feel so much

904.399 --> 909.44
a lot made me fail a lot and it was

906.8 --> 911.5999999999999
really the moment when i didn't care

909.44 --> 914.32
there was this is another this is like

911.6 --> 916.8000000000001
huge luciferians like really

914.32 --> 917.9200000000001
stared at that they they want to trick

916.8 --> 921.3599999999999
you through that

917.92 --> 921.36
that when i didn't care

921.44 --> 927.2790000000001
then my consciousness would let go

924.72 --> 928.48
and then the autopilot with whatever was

927.279 --> 930.8
available which was

928.48 --> 933.44
already pretty good even though not as

930.8 --> 935.5999999999999
compacted and serious as now

933.44 --> 937.1990000000001
i would be able to just do things and

935.6 --> 940.48
like really

937.199 --> 943.3599999999999
perform with ideas with

940.48 --> 945.1990000000001
social interactions at a very young age

943.36 --> 946.32
but it was really when i didn't care and

945.199 --> 948.399
this is even like

946.32 --> 950.0790000000001
how yeah meeting girlfriends seemed to

948.399 --> 953.36
work like i stopped caring about it

950.079 --> 955.519
densely bump into it and it works

953.36 --> 956.48
but it's about the conscious attention

955.519 --> 959.519
and

956.48 --> 963.12
and if you manage to

959.519 --> 964.88
let it go but without then

963.12 --> 966.72
finding an alternative route of some

964.88 --> 968.0
doom that you'll never get it and focus

966.72 --> 970.48
on that but if you just let

968.0 --> 971.199
it go from your conscious like just let

970.48 --> 973.6
it go don't

971.199 --> 974.88
find an alternative this tendency you

973.6 --> 978.24
know oh

974.88 --> 981.279
but if we don't know everything

978.24 --> 983.12
then what is it you know that

981.279 --> 984.8
you have to have the alternative this is

983.12 --> 988.9590000000001
a very human tendency is

984.8 --> 993.04
holding on but if you don't do that

988.959 --> 995.3599999999999
then suddenly the subconscious

993.04 --> 996.7199999999999
depending on how serious you take

995.36 --> 999.839
yourself in the world

996.72 --> 1002.8000000000001
and your and what you want to do

999.839 --> 1004.48
will be able to use all of that that you

1002.8 --> 1007.7589999999999
consciously let go

1004.48 --> 1011.759
to build yourself

1007.759 --> 1014.24
and your abilities towards what you want

1011.759 --> 1016.8000000000001
towards your vision of how you want to

1014.24 --> 1020.5600000000001
be and what you want to do

1016.8 --> 1023.5999999999999
huh some good gravy right

1020.56 --> 1025.1989999999998
this stuff it's very esoteric and

1023.6 --> 1029.28
this is another one of those moments

1025.199 --> 1031.76
this there is no consciousness involved

1029.28 --> 1033.76
this is for my consciousness everything

1031.76 --> 1037.199
i said so far is a very light

1033.76 --> 1038.8799999999999
process is just

1037.199 --> 1040.799
the only thing that i consciously focus

1038.88 --> 1042.64
on is the frequency and even like the

1040.799 --> 1044.959
description of the moment

1042.64 --> 1045.8390000000002
i've just look at the frequency the feel

1044.959 --> 1048.0
of it

1045.839 --> 1049.039
the memory of how it is to adapt to it

1048.0 --> 1051.6
and to let

1049.039 --> 1054.96
not let your consciousness latch onto

1051.6 --> 1054.9599999999998
and try to determinate it

1055.28 --> 1058.3999999999999
it's a very simple thing and everything

1056.96 --> 1061.6000000000001
that i did verbally

1058.4 --> 1064.799
fully automated it's it's like an auto

1061.6 --> 1066.08
build system that just builds the

1064.799 --> 1069.9189999999999
language to describe

1066.08 --> 1081.84
it on top of it it's fully automated

1069.919 --> 1081.8400000000001
it's fascinating to me how this works

1083.44 --> 1090.24
yeah but that automated process

1087.039 --> 1093.679
a dot it does cost energy

1090.24 --> 1096.4
and i can't hold do it forever

1093.679 --> 1098.4
like i can't have like a half an hour

1096.4 --> 1100.88
non-stop

1098.4 --> 1102.16
explanation of a singular thing that

1100.88 --> 1104.0
i've never achieved that

1102.16 --> 1106.16
you know i think as long as i could keep

1104.0 --> 1107.12
it up is for 15 minutes and after that i

1106.16 --> 1110.48
just

1107.12 --> 1110.4799999999998
like kind of run out of breath

1110.64 --> 1113.76
it's weird how that works

1120.96 --> 1125.679
all right so anyway

1126.16 --> 1130.559
ball busters fallacies was good hey

1128.72 --> 1136.64
nathan oakley by the way

1130.559 --> 1139.9189999999999
and dank iron f e

1136.64 --> 1141.919
uh yeah there was also owen benjamin

1139.919 --> 1143.8400000000001
although yeah i literally barely was

1141.919 --> 1144.4
able to see it because there was so many

1143.84 --> 1148.559
issues

1144.4 --> 1151.6000000000001
with d live it's just annoying

1148.559 --> 1155.28
oh yeah and my subscription record

1151.6 --> 1158.9599999999998
ran out so i can't comment anymore

1155.28 --> 1160.48
but yeah yeah you know you can get it

1158.96 --> 1162.8400000000001
back people like throw out

1160.48 --> 1165.2
subscriptions you just have to click in

1162.84 --> 1167.52
time

1165.2 --> 1170.48
but yeah he had like this trainer guy on

1167.52 --> 1170.48
i don't remember his name

1171.039 --> 1174.96
yeah like a viking looking guy pretty

1173.44 --> 1178.0
handsome

1174.96 --> 1181.2
and uh he was yeah

1178.0 --> 1183.44
also part of the team i think

1181.2 --> 1185.52
or at least like in the they were old

1183.44 --> 1188.16
friends

1185.52 --> 1189.84
but that was apparently that was

1188.16 --> 1191.679
apparent enough to me

1189.84 --> 1193.52
from what i could see but yeah i didn't

1191.679 --> 1197.1200000000001
get a lot of details because just the

1193.52 --> 1197.12
life kept cutting out so much

1197.6 --> 1204.32
uh right so

1201.039 --> 1208.24
then rodrigo was also live i

1204.32 --> 1211.52
i what he does a lot of streams lately

1208.24 --> 1215.44
and i like i like them a lot

1211.52 --> 1215.44
the golden one what dank

1217.76 --> 1222.559
but yeah this time he was basically

1219.84 --> 1226.08
reviewing a

1222.559 --> 1229.12
an indian guy who is talking about

1226.08 --> 1232.799
the vedic cosmology and

1229.12 --> 1234.08
architectures and designs of religious

1232.799 --> 1236.559
iconography and he

1234.08 --> 1238.3999999999999
was like trying to argue for the globe

1236.559 --> 1239.36
and how the ancient religion do about

1238.4 --> 1242.48
the globe

1239.36 --> 1245.6
like in yeah

1242.48 --> 1248.64
the statue of one of the gods i think

1245.6 --> 1250.32
the hindu gods holding an egg and then

1248.64 --> 1253.2800000000002
he's like yeah

1250.32 --> 1255.6789999999999
that's that's the earth that he's

1253.28 --> 1255.6789999999999
holding

1255.76 --> 1264.4
like no the earth is not a long egg

1260.88 --> 1265.7600000000002
and if yeah i even put this out in his

1264.4 --> 1268.48
chat and he agreed

1265.76 --> 1269.2
like it looked more like one of the one

1268.48 --> 1273.44
of the three

1269.2 --> 1275.28
holy stones from indiana jones too

1273.44 --> 1277.44
the temple of doom it literally looked

1275.28 --> 1280.48
like that even had like this weird

1277.44 --> 1282.799
little stripes on it it was yeah

1280.48 --> 1285.2
very funny to realize that so either it

1282.799 --> 1287.2
was that or if it was a representation

1285.2 --> 1291.52
of the earth realm

1287.2 --> 1294.24
then it might have been the container

1291.52 --> 1295.44
in which the earth is inside with the

1294.24 --> 1298.88
air on the top side

1295.44 --> 1301.919
and on the bottom side the rest

1298.88 --> 1303.7600000000002
dirt and rock you know and but he just

1301.919 --> 1304.24
didn't address it no no that's the ball

1303.76 --> 1306.0
earth

1304.24 --> 1307.76
even though that didn't look like it at

1306.0 --> 1309.36
all he like started arguing

1307.76 --> 1310.799
pear-shaped even though that's like a

1309.36 --> 1313.9189999999999
more flat

1310.799 --> 1314.799
thing and then say oh look he's holding

1313.919 --> 1318.4
it see

1314.799 --> 1319.9189999999999
and he he actually had the balls

1318.4 --> 1322.48
because you have to have balls to do

1319.919 --> 1325.44
that sort of you know hold spa

1322.48 --> 1326.559
that he was that the god was holding the

1325.44 --> 1330.24
earth

1326.559 --> 1332.8799999999999
basically west or east up like that

1330.24 --> 1334.48
on the side and like oh yeah that makes

1332.88 --> 1336.96
a lot of sense

1334.48 --> 1336.96
sure

1337.919 --> 1341.679
but yeah the whole that whole stream was

1341.039 --> 1345.679
really

1341.679 --> 1348.96
interesting i i like when rotary go

1345.679 --> 1352.72
like on his own starts reviewing

1348.96 --> 1355.2
like those types of things those pieces

1352.72 --> 1356.88
because he's he's very calm he doesn't

1355.2 --> 1359.039
get over excited

1356.88 --> 1361.0390000000002
and he's very smart and that just yeah

1359.039 --> 1364.08
that

1361.039 --> 1368.08
that really highlights a lot of details

1364.08 --> 1368.08
and i get fire very inspired by it

1368.48 --> 1377.76
all right

1375.36 --> 1379.36
gfc denied flat earth on the official

1377.76 --> 1382.32
podcast i don't know what it is

1379.36 --> 1384.0
good servant who's jeff c he said that

1382.32 --> 1386.1589999999999
in skype too i don't know who that is

1384.0 --> 1389.84
but thanks for the super chat donation

1386.159 --> 1389.8400000000001
by the way the 99 cents

1399.679 --> 1405.8400000000001
right so yeah and after that i've been

1403.12 --> 1405.84
gaming a lot

1406.24 --> 1412.24
but also been watching away again

1409.679 --> 1414.64
the series apparently rodrigo i think

1412.24 --> 1416.48
has watched it again it has watched some

1414.64 --> 1419.039
of that also

1416.48 --> 1421.44
and i'm now pretty far into season one

1419.039 --> 1424.0
like episode seven or something

1421.44 --> 1426.48
and it is really becoming the patterns

1424.0 --> 1430.96
becoming so apparent of how it works

1426.48 --> 1433.76
these space series it's just

1430.96 --> 1436.48
you have viruses you have the hazards of

1433.76 --> 1436.48
outer space

1436.88 --> 1440.96
and yeah very few moments of actual

1439.919 --> 1442.7990000000002
space

1440.96 --> 1444.48
scenario footage where they're in

1442.799 --> 1447.039
spacesuits outside

1444.48 --> 1448.88
doing stuff those moments were really

1447.039 --> 1451.44
good i really like them

1448.88 --> 1452.72
like oh [ __ ] man that that gave me like

1451.44 --> 1455.8400000000001
space quartz

1452.72 --> 1457.919
oh [ __ ] so good

1455.84 --> 1459.12
because they also didn't overdo it and

1457.919 --> 1461.5200000000002
they emphasized

1459.12 --> 1462.559
extra how dangerous and exciting it is

1461.52 --> 1466.96
and

1462.559 --> 1466.96
that's kind of what that's

1467.12 --> 1473.6789999999999
the most convincing you know

1470.64 --> 1475.8400000000001
but then they padded a lot with just

1473.679 --> 1476.5590000000002
drama and just like personal conflict

1475.84 --> 1478.72
but oh but

1476.559 --> 1480.8799999999999
my god like oh we're so separated oh

1478.72 --> 1484.799
it's so tough being separated

1480.88 --> 1487.0390000000002
they so overdo that it's like padding

1484.799 --> 1489.039
with drama that's what i call the drama

1487.039 --> 1490.72
part of space series

1489.039 --> 1492.08
and then of course there's always

1490.72 --> 1494.48
viruses

1492.08 --> 1497.12
in space that's that's very apparent

1494.48 --> 1500.799
always viruses

1497.12 --> 1504.08
there's always every every

1500.799 --> 1507.52
freaking space series

1504.08 --> 1510.8799999999999
ever made has freaking viruses in it

1507.52 --> 1513.279
just check it out i'm making this call

1510.88 --> 1515.6000000000001
if you can disprove me if you've ever

1513.279 --> 1518.0
not not talking about movies necessarily

1515.6 --> 1521.12
although a lot of them do it also

1518.0 --> 1522.159
right but i'm pretty certain that any

1521.12 --> 1524.559
series

1522.159 --> 1525.8400000000001
that is about space if it's at least one

1524.559 --> 1528.48
season

1525.84 --> 1530.3999999999999
at least say eight episodes there is

1528.48 --> 1532.64
going to be some kind of freaking virus

1530.4 --> 1532.64
in it

1535.36 --> 1540.84
now i'm wondering if that also counts

1538.96 --> 1542.08
for example for this great series

1540.84 --> 1544.32
firefly

1542.08 --> 1547.12
was there a virus in there that might be

1544.32 --> 1547.12
an exception

1549.84 --> 1557.84
let me think back carefully

1558.96 --> 1565.6000000000001
um yes

1562.0 --> 1568.64
no it was the movie

1565.6 --> 1570.7199999999998
but the movie didn't even express

1568.64 --> 1572.48
specifically it's a virus it's more like

1570.72 --> 1574.32
a chemical they said

1572.48 --> 1576.159
that was going to that yeah that was

1574.32 --> 1579.2
used by the

1576.159 --> 1580.4
government to experiment on people yeah

1579.2 --> 1583.8400000000001
as a passive

1580.4 --> 1586.159
agent a pacifying agent and then it

1583.84 --> 1589.6789999999999
turned kind of deadly

1586.159 --> 1591.6000000000001
uh yeah it's not yeah okay so

1589.679 --> 1593.2
i guess that firefly would be an

1591.6 --> 1595.6789999999999
exception but

1593.2 --> 1597.279
okay let's just rephrase that maybe it's

1595.679 --> 1597.679
after a certain point you know there's

1597.279 --> 1599.919
not

1597.679 --> 1601.52
been a lot of space series anyway

1599.919 --> 1603.2
because they before were kind of

1601.52 --> 1605.9189999999999
difficult to make i guess

1603.2 --> 1611.93
now with the cgi it's more easy so maybe

1605.919 --> 1613.76
i'd say that

1611.93 --> 1615.8400000000001
[Music]

1613.76 --> 1617.76
but even the star trek series and all

1615.84 --> 1621.36
that all had it

1617.76 --> 1621.36
babylon 5 had it

1623.12 --> 1626.4799999999998
like all significant space series that i

1626.08 --> 1629.76
know

1626.48 --> 1633.279
and even the old star trek they

1629.76 --> 1641.84
all had viruses star trek has

1633.279 --> 1641.84
a lot of viruses

1645.2 --> 1651.6000000000001
i hate when he truth or deny splattered

1649.279 --> 1652.72
oh yeah well it's just difficult good

1651.6 --> 1656.399
servant i don't know

1652.72 --> 1656.3990000000001
is he some prominent guy

1656.48 --> 1659.84
i've never heard of him

1658.48 --> 1664.24
[Music]

1659.84 --> 1664.24
why are you still caught up on it let's

1666.84 --> 1669.84
heaven

1677.1 --> 1683.84
[Music]

1679.84 --> 1683.84
he does good work does he

1707.84 --> 1712.799
truth should have no limits i don't know

1710.159 --> 1712.7990000000002
good servant

1713.84 --> 1719.4399999999998
everybody has their limits

1716.81 --> 1721.52
[Music]

1719.44 --> 1722.96
and even though i find it disappointing

1721.52 --> 1726.08
that so many people

1722.96 --> 1728.88
are doing great out there but cannot go

1726.08 --> 1732.1589999999999
that final step of flat earth

1728.88 --> 1733.279
i do understand why what's preventing

1732.159 --> 1735.5200000000002
them

1733.279 --> 1737.039
because they have all these things in

1735.52 --> 1739.279
their lives

1737.039 --> 1741.52
that they already might have suspicion

1739.279 --> 1743.36
from just staring at flat earth from the

1741.52 --> 1745.2
outside like that's not real

1743.36 --> 1749.36
but to their consciousness it's still

1745.2 --> 1752.0
real and it's very ominous feeling

1749.36 --> 1754.0
i remember that it's very um it's very

1752.0 --> 1755.919
scary

1754.0 --> 1758.399
when you have things that you literally

1755.919 --> 1760.64
accept as true and as for granted

1758.399 --> 1762.559
that you f is part of your vernacular

1760.64 --> 1763.1200000000001
part of your standard construction

1762.559 --> 1765.12
method

1763.12 --> 1766.4799999999998
right if you're always going gonna

1765.12 --> 1766.9599999999998
assume the earth is a globe if you're

1766.48 --> 1768.88
always

1766.96 --> 1770.72
gonna assume that satellites will be a

1768.88 --> 1772.48
thing

1770.72 --> 1774.3990000000001
you're gonna draw that [ __ ] into

1772.48 --> 1776.88
everything and that is very ominous

1774.399 --> 1779.1999999999998
realization

1776.88 --> 1780.48
so your consciousness kind of like keeps

1779.2 --> 1783.3600000000001
that away

1780.48 --> 1785.52
it's very ominous that's exactly what it

1783.36 --> 1785.52
is

1786.32 --> 1791.2
so i i'm not surprised that there's

1789.36 --> 1792.399
truthers that are very good at what they

1791.2 --> 1797.1200000000001
do

1792.399 --> 1799.6
that just will keep on pushing that off

1797.12 --> 1800.799
and the worse flat earthers try to push

1799.6 --> 1804.399
it towards them

1800.799 --> 1808.08
the more ridicule they will fabricate

1804.399 --> 1810.32
to keep it off which is basically

1808.08 --> 1812.6399999999999
a discouraging policy you have to

1810.32 --> 1815.84
realize that

1812.64 --> 1819.44
it's like we i don't want to know

1815.84 --> 1824.799
leave me alone or i'm going to

1819.44 --> 1824.799
add harm you call you stupid

1827.62 --> 1830.6799999999998
[Music]

1831.919 --> 1839.679
right and for a lot of smart people

1837.2 --> 1842.32
studied people flat earth is also

1839.679 --> 1845.1200000000001
problematic now

1842.32 --> 1846.399
because there's a lot of flat earthers

1845.12 --> 1850.6399999999999
myself included

1846.399 --> 1852.8799999999999
huey nathan and a lot of others are all

1850.64 --> 1854.24
also slowly starting to really make it

1852.88 --> 1857.3600000000001
their own

1854.24 --> 1861.2
that is that what's called science

1857.36 --> 1865.12
out there isn't actually science

1861.2 --> 1868.159
it's a male f it's a colloquial

1865.12 --> 1871.9189999999999
cultural word placement that's basically

1868.159 --> 1874.96
replaced what science actually was

1871.919 --> 1877.1200000000001
a method an empirical method to

1874.96 --> 1880.0
determine the cause of an effect

1877.12 --> 1881.36
and that for a long time now this has

1880.0 --> 1884.72
been kind of like

1881.36 --> 1886.559
shoved under the carpet and just left

1884.72 --> 1889.1200000000001
there and then they

1886.559 --> 1891.039
start to become more liberal about what

1889.12 --> 1892.2399999999998
science really means and then oh wait

1891.039 --> 1895.36
maybe we should just call

1892.24 --> 1897.36
all knowledge knowledge gathering we

1895.36 --> 1898.6399999999999
call that science now just leave the

1897.36 --> 1902.399
empirical

1898.64 --> 1905.3600000000001
method out of it it's just as long

1902.399 --> 1906.7199999999998
as there is some logical consistency or

1905.36 --> 1909.12
a correlation

1906.72 --> 1911.039
it's good enough that's what they did

1909.12 --> 1914.32
and that gives a lot of freedom

1911.039 --> 1917.919
in your imagination again

1914.32 --> 1920.399
see makes it

1917.919 --> 1922.24
about your imagination and then you can

1920.399 --> 1923.76
think you're doing science in your

1922.24 --> 1925.679
imagination very easy it's very

1923.76 --> 1929.519
satisfying you feel like you're doing

1925.679 --> 1929.519
something useful with your imagination

1929.84 --> 1936.72
can be very rewarding sensation but

1934.159 --> 1938.5590000000002
yeah a lot of these people that are

1936.72 --> 1940.24
think they're very intelligent and that

1938.559 --> 1943.039
can even verbalize

1940.24 --> 1946.0
their conceptions very eloquently they

1943.039 --> 1949.12
don't realize that they've

1946.0 --> 1953.519
yeah went off into basically a cultural

1949.12 --> 1953.5189999999998
thing and not so much a scientific thing

1954.32 --> 1958.24
it's colloquial science and that's a

1956.88 --> 1960.96
very tough

1958.24 --> 1962.64
thing for the ego that's like relying on

1960.96 --> 1967.1200000000001
but i

1962.64 --> 1970.5590000000002
took this route because of the reward

1967.12 --> 1971.12
see it's very tough to then basically

1970.559 --> 1974.32
step

1971.12 --> 1976.8799999999999
off that and just

1974.32 --> 1977.9189999999999
be more modest about what science really

1976.88 --> 1981.0390000000002
is

1977.919 --> 1983.1200000000001
and then see if it's still worth it to

1981.039 --> 1985.279
try and construct something

1983.12 --> 1986.1589999999999
from that honest bottom up and it's very

1985.279 --> 1988.48
tough

1986.159 --> 1990.7990000000002
i'm trying it it's extremely tough and

1988.48 --> 1993.1200000000001
i'm pretty smart

1990.799 --> 1995.279
i'm trying to figure out experiments for

1993.12 --> 1997.76
example with the moonlight

1995.279 --> 1997.76
but yeah

1998.32 --> 2004.8799999999999
my peers in this case keep deflecting it

2002.0 --> 2007.279
because i'm not properly varying and

2004.88 --> 2009.6000000000001
manipulating the phenomena

2007.279 --> 2011.36
but it's i think i might get there but

2009.6 --> 2012.559
it's more about the formulation the

2011.36 --> 2015.6
formulation thing

2012.559 --> 2018.6399999999999
about how to pre yeah how to formulate

2015.6 --> 2021.76
something a scientific

2018.64 --> 2024.72
experiment is just very tough for me

2021.76 --> 2025.76
i have trouble with basically figure out

2024.72 --> 2027.919
something new i

2025.76 --> 2029.679
it's very good it would be good for me

2027.919 --> 2031.6000000000001
if i just had somebody that would be

2029.679 --> 2034.72
willing to try and build something like

2031.6 --> 2034.7199999999998
that with me

2034.96 --> 2046.08
but yeah the guys seem to not be very

2039.2 --> 2051.04
willing to do that

2046.08 --> 2051.04
hey ryan eartherton good to see you

2057.919 --> 2061.839
but anyway yeah that's

2062.879 --> 2068.7999999999997
another reason why smart people

2066.72 --> 2070.3199999999997
tend to not like flat earth because it

2068.8 --> 2072.8790000000004
confronts them

2070.32 --> 2074.8
that they may have made some mistakes

2072.879 --> 2078.56
and

2074.8 --> 2082.159
lu used illusory power

2078.56 --> 2086.839
for fake intellectual momentum

2082.159 --> 2090.32
for fake power and that's

2086.839 --> 2092.7999999999997
shocking it's not very pleasant because

2090.32 --> 2095.2000000000003
if you then keep on doing it

2092.8 --> 2097.679
then you're basically becoming part of

2095.2 --> 2097.6789999999996
the lie

2098.56 --> 2101.599
and you want to try to forget that so

2101.04 --> 2104.8
that

2101.599 --> 2105.52
the lie is not yeah it doesn't rub off

2104.8 --> 2107.8390000000004
on you

2105.52 --> 2109.119
that you don't feel like a liar it's so

2107.839 --> 2113.359
very complicated see

2109.119 --> 2117.28
ignorance is really like a mechanism

2113.359 --> 2120.16
that does keep it all going

2117.28 --> 2124.32
so if you're part of yeah all these

2120.16 --> 2128.3999999999996
illusory fabrications of pseudoscience

2124.32 --> 2129.3590000000004
then yeah your con your subconsciousness

2128.4 --> 2131.28
will basically

2129.359 --> 2133.119
give you warning signs the ominous

2131.28 --> 2136.6400000000003
feeling and then

2133.119 --> 2136.96
make you attack things that are risking

2136.64 --> 2140.48
the

2136.96 --> 2145.599
in structural integrity

2140.48 --> 2148.48
of the belief you're part of

2145.599 --> 2152.0
to fend off things that endanger that

2148.48 --> 2152.0
and it will be subconscious

2152.079 --> 2159.8390000000004
your consciousness will not be very

2154.079 --> 2159.8390000000004
active when you act out like that

2163.119 --> 2168.4
probably be focused on yeah in this very

2166.4 --> 2170.64
social way so another modus

2168.4 --> 2173.76
it's the intellect is turned off in such

2170.64 --> 2177.04
moments it's on purpose

2173.76 --> 2177.0400000000004
that's part of the mechanism

2184.839 --> 2187.839
right

2190.32 --> 2193.52
right so uh

2197.92 --> 2202.8
yeah that was that was my

2203.28 --> 2206.4
little talk about that

2208.079 --> 2212.6400000000003
yeah i got my heater on because i don't

2210.72 --> 2214.7999999999997
know i don't want to sit here with a

2212.64 --> 2218.64
sweater on

2214.8 --> 2222.6400000000003
but it's it's kind of too too chilly to

2218.64 --> 2222.64
just sit in my t-shirt like that

2226.839 --> 2231.139
hmm

2227.96 --> 2231.139
[Music]

2240.839 --> 2243.839
parrot

2245.76 --> 2252.0
sounds all scientific and stuff well

2248.48 --> 2252.0
there you go that's already

2252.16 --> 2260.48
when you say it sounds scientific

2256.079 --> 2263.52
that's you utilizing and affirming

2260.48 --> 2266.88
the pseudoscience you're saying that

2263.52 --> 2269.119
something can sound scientific

2266.88 --> 2270.6400000000003
really it sounds like a cause and effect

2269.119 --> 2273.76
relationship

2270.64 --> 2274.96
experiment does it sound like that no

2273.76 --> 2278.079
that's a saying

2274.96 --> 2278.8
that you are affirming by using it

2278.079 --> 2281.8390000000004
because

2278.8 --> 2285.28
that's the way to describe it

2281.839 --> 2288.64
right no they made it into you saying

2285.28 --> 2288.6400000000003
that it sounds scientific

2293.52 --> 2312.079
i wonder what it was before

2296.8 --> 2315.2000000000003
that was called scientific

2312.079 --> 2317.2000000000003
science fiction right but that i i'm

2315.2 --> 2321.2
just wondering what people

2317.2 --> 2323.839
general people would call it before

2321.2 --> 2325.68
the colloquial terminology of it sounds

2323.839 --> 2328.72
all scientific

2325.68 --> 2330.96
started to take grip

2328.72 --> 2331.7599999999998
probably through media indoctrination

2330.96 --> 2336.32
through

2331.76 --> 2339.44
television and radio

2336.32 --> 2342.48
and people being part of the

2339.44 --> 2344.32
revolution of this oh we can science is

2342.48 --> 2347.599
for everyone now you can be a scientist

2344.32 --> 2350.8
and then believing it and then

2347.599 --> 2353.6800000000003
talking like that and thereby

2350.8 --> 2355.599
also spreading around that colloquial

2353.68 --> 2369.839
way of using word science

2355.599 --> 2369.839
see that's how that happened pretty sure

2370.72 --> 2376.48
when did that happen i wonder when it

2374.24 --> 2379.04
did happen

2376.48 --> 2381.359
i think it would have been the 50s and

2379.04 --> 2385.2799999999997
60s

2381.359 --> 2385.2799999999997
and yeah when it started

2390.96 --> 2397.839
maybe before i don't know i'm not the

2394.839 --> 2397.839
best

2398.0 --> 2401.68
historical details like that

2404.64 --> 2410.8799999999997
but yeah the most of it would have been

2407.76 --> 2411.5200000000004
placed through media that's always where

2410.88 --> 2414.4
they start

2411.52 --> 2414.4
the programming

2415.28 --> 2419.28
these types of programming like they

2417.359 --> 2421.2
know

2419.28 --> 2422.96
the people that make the program they

2421.2 --> 2424.0
know what they're doing they know they

2422.96 --> 2426.64
are distorting

2424.0 --> 2428.24
words they are like rubbing something

2426.64 --> 2429.1189999999997
under the carpet from the public

2428.24 --> 2438.7999999999997
conscious

2429.119 --> 2440.48
they know it's very devious people

2438.8 --> 2442.5600000000004
i'm not talking about the people that

2440.48 --> 2445.76
actually execute that

2442.56 --> 2448.0789999999997
on air they're usually more actors they

2445.76 --> 2452.6400000000003
kind of are aware of what's happening

2448.079 --> 2455.599
they're not the ones designing

2452.64 --> 2457.839
the yeah the actions the ones that do

2455.599 --> 2461.2000000000003
that actually have control over

2457.839 --> 2464.64
media companies like that they know

2461.2 --> 2467.2
they know they are obfuscating

2464.64 --> 2467.7599999999998
information from the public conscious

2467.2 --> 2470.56
like and

2467.76 --> 2471.2000000000003
they're manipulating how people think

2470.56 --> 2473.68
they know

2471.2 --> 2481.839
it they know what they're doing and they

2473.68 --> 2481.839
do these things

2500.319 --> 2508.24
oh yay yes we need an app

2505.28 --> 2510.0
to understand why the earth is a globe

2508.24 --> 2512.0789999999997
because you see

2510.0 --> 2513.839
certain heavily lights at a certain

2512.079 --> 2516.5600000000004
angle in certain locations

2513.839 --> 2517.44
well simultaneously in another location

2516.56 --> 2520.72
you see

2517.44 --> 2523.44
heavenly light at another angle right

2520.72 --> 2524.64
in a persistent geometrical pattern is

2523.44 --> 2529.04
is that your argument

2524.64 --> 2533.04
mn because

2529.04 --> 2537.119
that doesn't prove the globe

2533.04 --> 2540.48
it just tells you that i can't imagine

2537.119 --> 2542.88
having these sightings

2540.48 --> 2543.52
on anything all else than the earth as a

2542.88 --> 2545.359
globe

2543.52 --> 2551.839
that's what you're saying with that

2545.359 --> 2551.839
statement amen

2562.839 --> 2565.839
um

2585.2 --> 2593.839
nothing yeah

2588.56 --> 2593.839
expected as much

2593.92 --> 2598.16
no it's not i just explained exactly why

2596.8 --> 2601.52
it's not a problem

2598.16 --> 2605.1189999999997
it's lights it's a celestial

2601.52 --> 2608.72
sphere of lights virtual

2605.119 --> 2611.92
that means it appears to observers

2608.72 --> 2614.9599999999996
to observation things

2611.92 --> 2617.28
to camera's eyes as a apparent

2614.96 --> 2619.92
demisphere because it's never

2617.28 --> 2622.4
beyond anything than a demisphere and

2619.92 --> 2627.04
there's very specific angular relations

2622.4 --> 2630.079
to aspects of this demisphere

2627.04 --> 2633.119
to the position of the earth and the

2630.079 --> 2633.119
progress of time

2633.76 --> 2638.48
and that's it there's no proof of any

2636.48 --> 2640.319
thing about the celestial sphere being

2638.48 --> 2644.56
an object

2640.319 --> 2644.56
in order to presuppose

2644.88 --> 2648.48
that you're actually standing on a

2646.839 --> 2651.52
sphere

2648.48 --> 2651.92
it's lights can't prove anything about

2651.52 --> 2657.2
them

2651.92 --> 2659.44
is physical or in a specific position

2657.2 --> 2660.839
the only thing there is is the angular

2659.44 --> 2663.839
relations which are

2660.839 --> 2663.839
set

2664.0 --> 2667.04
but other than that

2667.119 --> 2670.88
even like a specific origin point can

2669.52 --> 2673.92
just cannot be

2670.88 --> 2675.28
properly determined it can only be

2673.92 --> 2678.48
calculated from

2675.28 --> 2680.88
ground level roughly

2678.48 --> 2683.359
but when you actually approach the

2680.88 --> 2688.079
supposed positions

2683.359 --> 2688.0789999999997
then yeah they just go away just

2688.72 --> 2693.1189999999997
yeah revealing it's not actually coming

2691.68 --> 2696.0
from the original

2693.119 --> 2698.4
presumed location how no matter how you

2696.0 --> 2701.599
triangulate things

2698.4 --> 2704.56
see so yeah you got a demi sphere of

2701.599 --> 2707.3590000000004
celestial lights with specific angular

2704.56 --> 2709.04
relations to observers and their

2707.359 --> 2711.359
position on the earth

2709.04 --> 2713.2799999999997
and the progress of time and those

2711.359 --> 2716.4
relations are very specific

2713.28 --> 2716.88
and sad and predictable that doesn't

2716.4 --> 2720.1600000000003
mean

2716.88 --> 2721.76
that the earth is a sphere means the

2720.16 --> 2726.0
celestial lights

2721.76 --> 2726.0
present themselves to observers as a

2730.839 --> 2733.839
demisphere

2738.56 --> 2744.209
[Music]

2744.8 --> 2749.28
right oh that was good too by the way

2746.96 --> 2752.4
because

2749.28 --> 2752.4
that was interesting

2753.52 --> 2758.8
rodrigo back to that again like after

2757.04 --> 2759.44
the review he also talked about some

2758.8 --> 2763.52
other things

2759.44 --> 2766.079
including that i might not be the only

2763.52 --> 2769.119
one that says

2766.079 --> 2772.4
that like beyond the known realm

2769.119 --> 2772.4
there might be another

2772.96 --> 2777.76
yeah i would say another half of the

2775.359 --> 2781.7599999999998
celestial sphere

2777.76 --> 2781.76
that will reveal itself like

2781.92 --> 2786.0
how do you explain this you got like the

2784.48 --> 2787.76
northern

2786.0 --> 2789.839
in this case it is proper to use the

2787.76 --> 2793.0400000000004
word the northern

2789.839 --> 2793.52
hemisphere of this of the celestial

2793.04 --> 2796.0
lights

2793.52 --> 2798.24
with the basically the north pole star

2796.0 --> 2800.72
at the center like this is

2798.24 --> 2803.04
a demi sphere and if you would be at the

2800.72 --> 2805.1189999999997
theoretical north point

2803.04 --> 2806.72
you yeah you would it would be right on

2805.119 --> 2809.52
top of you and you would you have the

2806.72 --> 2809.52
demi sphere

2809.68 --> 2814.64
completely in view like that side of the

2812.64 --> 2818.0
cup is just completely up

2814.64 --> 2821.1189999999997
but if you go to the equator then

2818.0 --> 2822.72
the southern hemisphere of the celestial

2821.119 --> 2825.04
light with the southern cross

2822.72 --> 2826.319
comes into being then they come from the

2825.04 --> 2829.52
side

2826.319 --> 2832.64
you have this effect

2829.52 --> 2835.359
right so you have two demi spheres

2832.64 --> 2837.04
shown and then if you would go to the

2835.359 --> 2838.16
theoretical south point and

2837.04 --> 2840.16
i don't think this has ever been

2838.16 --> 2842.3999999999996
achieved even really

2840.16 --> 2843.2799999999997
that it would be like this and you would

2842.4 --> 2847.44
have a

2843.28 --> 2850.6400000000003
the demi sphere of the south

2847.44 --> 2852.559
at the top well i speculated

2850.64 --> 2854.319
and i have that show and i even put it

2852.559 --> 2856.88
the link out in his chat

2854.319 --> 2857.7599999999998
to review that from the flat earth talks

2856.88 --> 2861.04
that

2857.76 --> 2864.8
theoretically if you would go beyond

2861.04 --> 2867.359
the north pole or south pole antiquater

2864.8 --> 2869.8390000000004
which is the counter opposite of the

2867.359 --> 2873.359
equator line

2869.839 --> 2875.92
right assuming that the north and the

2873.359 --> 2879.2799999999997
south pole are not points on the sphere

2875.92 --> 2882.079
right but instead

2879.28 --> 2883.28
on a wait let me show the picture i got

2882.079 --> 2886.319
the i got the picture

2883.28 --> 2901.8390000000004
what am i doing

2886.319 --> 2901.839
should just show it again

2903.76 --> 2909.3590000000004
right uh

2906.8 --> 2909.3590000000004
let's see

2913.28 --> 2917.4
all right so this is a rectangular

2916.0 --> 2920.88
looping model

2917.4 --> 2924.7200000000003
representation from yeah looking at it

2920.88 --> 2928.4
with infinite view no refraction

2924.72 --> 2930.64
limit no yeah no limit to sight it's in

2928.4 --> 2932.64
a virtual vacuum so you then have

2930.64 --> 2933.92
problems and you're looking from outside

2932.64 --> 2937.5989999999997
of the space

2933.92 --> 2942.4
of the realm confine through it through

2937.599 --> 2945.44
yeah and the antiquater is

2942.4 --> 2948.559
is a line here are two lines and i

2945.44 --> 2951.359
speculated that beyond that

2948.559 --> 2951.3590000000004
let me get back

2952.4 --> 2957.76
to my hand's description beyond that you

2956.0 --> 2959.599
have like either the demisphere of the

2957.76 --> 2960.4
north or the demosphere of the south if

2959.599 --> 2963.599
you would move

2960.4 --> 2966.64
beyond i speculated it would

2963.599 --> 2970.559
continue rotating

2966.64 --> 2972.4
and then reveal another demi-sphere on

2970.559 --> 2976.079
the other side

2972.4 --> 2978.8
instead of the one you're familiar with

2976.079 --> 2979.8390000000004
turning back up no no you would go

2978.8 --> 2983.04
beyond

2979.839 --> 2986.319
to another demisphere

2983.04 --> 2989.599
situation in the other realm

2986.319 --> 2993.52
almost like every realm is comprised

2989.599 --> 2996.7200000000003
of two demi spheres of light

2993.52 --> 2999.7599999999998
and when you switch realm

2996.72 --> 3001.9199999999996
then it the the southern themisphere

2999.76 --> 3003.2000000000003
becomes the northern demisphere and

3001.92 --> 3006.8
another

3003.2 --> 3013.68
southern demise fear is revealed

3006.8 --> 3017.119
yeah oh god

3013.68 --> 3017.1189999999997
oh jesus these are like

3019.52 --> 3025.7599999999998
i don't know why but it's like some

3022.96 --> 3026.64
turkish thing going on there and even

3025.76 --> 3029.8390000000004
have like these

3026.64 --> 3031.52
freaking flags on their cars weird

3029.839 --> 3034.88
i guess they're like showing how tough

3031.52 --> 3034.88
they are or something

3037.52 --> 3041.839
definitely showing how freaking loud

3039.2 --> 3041.839
they are

3057.2 --> 3068.8799999999997
[ __ ] so yeah i hope that

3061.76 --> 3071.28
that explained that concept once again

3068.88 --> 3073.119
and then also we have reveals to some

3071.28 --> 3074.1600000000003
globals here that have issues with the

3073.119 --> 3076.319
heavenly lights

3074.16 --> 3078.7999999999997
and that some things should not be seen

3076.319 --> 3083.359
well this shows exactly

3078.8 --> 3085.8390000000004
what i think is the case

3083.359 --> 3087.119
based on presuppositions though that

3085.839 --> 3090.4
there is

3087.119 --> 3093.599
a point beyond the north and the south

3090.4 --> 3095.76
pole that you could physically reach

3093.599 --> 3098.1600000000003
and then the north and south pole would

3095.76 --> 3101.0400000000004
not be poles anymore they would become

3098.16 --> 3101.04
antiquaters

3108.839 --> 3111.839
instead

3122.839 --> 3127.2799999999997
what

3124.64 --> 3128.48
southern cross not visible from europe

3127.28 --> 3139.8390000000004
yeah

3128.48 --> 3139.839
of course

3154.72 --> 3158.5589999999997
so are you guys just squatting in my

3156.96 --> 3160.64
chat and not listening

3158.559 --> 3162.96
to my actual address all of your

3160.64 --> 3167.839
supposed arguments

3162.96 --> 3167.839
and just reasserting the same things

3168.53 --> 3172.4
[Music]

3170.319 --> 3174.5589999999997
because if you're here for to make an

3172.4 --> 3177.599
actual argument then you gotta

3174.559 --> 3195.8390000000004
also respond to the rebuttal that i'm

3177.599 --> 3195.839
the host verbally giving you on air

3197.599 --> 3202.2400000000002
now you know it is an argument neon

3199.839 --> 3202.24
boots

3202.48 --> 3206.2400000000002
but yeah yeah not look you are there and

3205.44 --> 3211.52
there's an

3206.24 --> 3211.52
mn kind of making similar arguments so

3212.079 --> 3215.119
in the same line

3215.68 --> 3225.5989999999997
don't be nitpicky

3223.28 --> 3229.52
right but yeah of course the southern

3225.599 --> 3229.52
cross is not visible from europe

3234.559 --> 3240.7200000000003
yeah that part of the the southern demi

3237.44 --> 3240.7200000000003
sphere is out of reach

3241.119 --> 3246.2400000000002
it's slanted out of sight of course it's

3244.079 --> 3251.25
not visible

3246.24 --> 3255.1789999999996
so what's your point

3251.25 --> 3255.179
[Music]

3259.44 --> 3265.4
you nearly got it no i don't nearly got

3262.72 --> 3269.1189999999997
it i got it the celestial

3265.4 --> 3271.839
demisphere which is a

3269.119 --> 3273.359
apparent demisphere of lights in a

3271.839 --> 3276.72
consistent patterns

3273.359 --> 3280.64
with angular changes over time

3276.72 --> 3283.7599999999998
and yeah and correlations to the

3280.64 --> 3287.04
position of the earth that are upset

3283.76 --> 3289.119
it's not a physical thing none of it is

3287.04 --> 3292.16
physical

3289.119 --> 3295.359
of those lights it just appears

3292.16 --> 3298.8799999999997
in that fashion to observers

3295.359 --> 3301.92
so yeah that part of the demi sphere

3298.88 --> 3305.599
the lights that are non actual position

3301.92 --> 3308.96
things it's just a holographic

3305.599 --> 3310.0
effect as part of sight the light

3308.96 --> 3312.7200000000003
arrives

3310.0 --> 3314.16
at the observer at their location but

3312.72 --> 3316.9599999999996
hey if you go way up then

3314.16 --> 3319.1189999999997
not so much anymore right yeah very

3316.96 --> 3322.48
confusing i know

3319.119 --> 3324.7200000000003
but yeah of course in europe you don't

3322.48 --> 3328.64
see the southern cross because

3324.72 --> 3335.839
that part of the demise fear is slanted

3328.64 --> 3335.839
out of view so we you can't reach that

3340.4 --> 3349.839
like a movie no more like a hologram

3350.72 --> 3363.839
like a rainbow

3368.23 --> 3371.34
[Music]

3388.0 --> 3393.76
34 latitude i do i'm not too great at

3400.0 --> 3406.4
i don't know where each latitude is

3404.4 --> 3408.799
by heart i don't even know the numerics

3406.4 --> 3419.839
of it too much

3408.799 --> 3419.839
can look it up of course

3420.559 --> 3433.8390000000004
oh great yeah that's

3440.64 --> 3448.319
all right hmm

3444.88 --> 3451.92
40 34 degrees right

3448.319 --> 3455.7599999999998
north of the sphere yeah

3451.92 --> 3459.04
or basically 34 degrees

3455.76 --> 3462.0
slant of the

3459.04 --> 3462.0
then celestial spheres

3462.24 --> 3468.64
yeah from beyond 90 degrees

3466.16 --> 3470.64
so it's yeah you could say oh but it's a

3468.64 --> 3474.96
34 degree

3470.64 --> 3478.4
slant of the sphere earth

3474.96 --> 3481.839
no it's of the celestial lights

3478.4 --> 3484.64
it's of the demi spheres that's

3481.839 --> 3489.7599999999998
that's really what it's based on anyway

3484.64 --> 3492.0789999999997
you know

3489.76 --> 3494.92
i think that the celestial demi spheres

3492.079 --> 3497.599
were realized and even icono

3494.92 --> 3499.359
iconographized that's even a word made

3497.599 --> 3503.2000000000003
into icons

3499.359 --> 3504.799
like spheres before the wizards started

3503.2 --> 3507.1189999999997
to say yeah maybe we could fool

3504.799 --> 3510.079
everyone into the earth being a sphere

3507.119 --> 3512.2400000000002
underneath the stars i think

3510.079 --> 3513.3590000000004
the awareness of the celestial sphere

3512.24 --> 3516.4799999999996
was very much

3513.359 --> 3517.119
present and presented as like a tool

3516.48 --> 3520.079
maybe

3517.119 --> 3522.2400000000002
as like a guild symbol like we know

3520.079 --> 3524.4
about the heavens we can predict things

3522.24 --> 3525.359
we are powerful because we have mastery

3524.4 --> 3529.6800000000003
of the stars

3525.359 --> 3532.24
that type of icon the sphere

3529.68 --> 3534.48
and then the globers the heliocentrist

3532.24 --> 3537.359
later said oh no no that just means they

3534.48 --> 3540.4
already kind of knew about the globe

3537.359 --> 3545.839
see because that's the trick that's what

3540.4 --> 3545.839
they do

3554.64 --> 3561.839
ah no pierre

3558.16 --> 3565.1189999999997
carl carlier

3561.839 --> 3565.119
that is not a sphere

3567.52 --> 3571.7599999999998
it's supposed to be an oblate spheroid

3569.839 --> 3575.2
according to helios interest

3571.76 --> 3577.92
right but it's not

3575.2 --> 3577.9199999999996
it's flat

3578.559 --> 3581.6800000000003
the geometrical orientation of the

3580.88 --> 3585.2000000000003
earth's

3581.68 --> 3586.24
surface and the water and all of it the

3585.2 --> 3601.839
orientation

3586.24 --> 3601.839
of the overall surface is flat

3617.839 --> 3620.72
one degree

3627.359 --> 3643.839
i that can't be right

3662.88 --> 3671.839
yeah [ __ ] get the [ __ ] out

3674.09 --> 3680.4990000000003
[Music]

3684.57 --> 3695.04
[Music]

3695.92 --> 3700.48
yeah yeah we don't care that he saw the

3699.04 --> 3703.2
iss last night

3700.48 --> 3703.839
he saw the iss last night he saw the

3703.2 --> 3706.48
idea

3703.839 --> 3706.48
piss off

3711.119 --> 3717.52
at least evan and is trying just

3714.48 --> 3721.359
trying to make an argument

3717.52 --> 3721.359
it's not doing very well i think but

3723.44 --> 3726.64
yeah it's just gonna spam a certain

3725.839 --> 3740.0789999999997
nonsense

3726.64 --> 3742.64
then yeah you're not welcome

3740.079 --> 3743.76
yeah but your observation is not the

3742.64 --> 3745.839
problem mn

3743.76 --> 3747.119
the problem is the conclusions that

3745.839 --> 3750.2799999999997
you're drawing

3747.119 --> 3755.839
based on a very specific

3750.28 --> 3755.8390000000004
presuppositional vantage point so

3758.0 --> 3763.039
the issue is not the observation the

3759.839 --> 3765.359
issue is your conclusion

3763.039 --> 3768.7990000000004
and the train of thought behind it

3765.359 --> 3770.48
that's the problem

3768.799 --> 3772.24
and i'm trying to explain this to you

3770.48 --> 3783.839
every single time but

3772.24 --> 3783.839
it seems like you're not listening

3809.76 --> 3816.7200000000003
right anyway i got another half hour

3813.68 --> 3816.72
for anything

3822.839 --> 3825.839
ugh

3859.599 --> 3864.88
so anyone still left in chat

3862.96 --> 3866.2400000000002
is there anything you would like me to

3864.88 --> 3870.319
address

3866.24 --> 3870.319
because yeah i'm kind of run out

3871.359 --> 3881.839
of subjects

3882.48 --> 3885.28
just chilling

3887.68 --> 3891.5989999999997
yeah i kind of feel like just chilling

3889.839 --> 3894.24
as well

3891.599 --> 3895.599
i'm just hoping that if when i go out

3894.24 --> 3897.68
for groceries

3895.599 --> 3901.28
after this it's not going to be raining

3897.68 --> 3901.2799999999997
because that would be annoying as [ __ ]

3906.96 --> 3912.88
no i don't need a guest thanks

3910.16 --> 3913.5989999999997
it's just half an hour but i i would

3912.88 --> 3915.359
like to

3913.599 --> 3917.6800000000003
i don't know discuss things if there is

3915.359 --> 3923.839
anything somebody would like to bring to

3917.68 --> 3923.839
my attention

3928.4 --> 3932.48
that was a good talk thanks gladshaw

3930.799 --> 3934.64
yeah i thought that

3932.48 --> 3935.839
yeah it was a good talk several

3934.64 --> 3938.64
conversations hey

3935.839 --> 3938.64
julie of heaven

3942.16 --> 3948.48
but yeah i'm kind of like i'm done

3945.44 --> 3951.839
i've explained it to the

3948.48 --> 3951.839
to the limits of my patience

3952.0 --> 3965.839
and yeah it was pretty good

3972.16 --> 3979.7599999999998
why don't i do a show with guests once

3977.2 --> 3982.319
because then my poor social skills would

3979.76 --> 3982.3190000000004
show again

3983.599 --> 3993.839
a classical homeopath

3997.839 --> 4004.24
okie dokie now

4001.119 --> 4007.44
i could have guests on again but it's

4004.24 --> 4011.839
always a little bit of a hassle you know

4007.44 --> 4014.2400000000002
like i'm good on a panel

4011.839 --> 4017.0389999999998
but if it's like a one-on-one guest

4014.24 --> 4017.0389999999998
situation

4017.44 --> 4021.839
yeah it's it's confusing for me because

4019.76 --> 4025.119
i'm

4021.839 --> 4026.48
just used to basically what you call it

4025.119 --> 4029.6800000000003
or rating

4026.48 --> 4033.2
just explaining things just

4029.68 --> 4034.96
looking in my mind constructing things

4033.2 --> 4036.799
referencing things and then explaining

4034.96 --> 4037.68
it constantly well that's not a very

4036.799 --> 4040.24
good skill

4037.68 --> 4043.1189999999997
if you're socially interacting with a

4040.24 --> 4043.1189999999997
guest because then

4043.599 --> 4046.799
well a good show host or an interviewer

4046.24 --> 4049.52
should be

4046.799 --> 4050.72
asking a lot of questions and all that

4049.52 --> 4054.559
but

4050.72 --> 4056.799
yeah i'm not i'm not the best guy to do

4054.559 --> 4056.799
that

4058.799 --> 4063.839
there's people that are just a lot

4060.4 --> 4063.839
better at it

4066.079 --> 4071.8390000000004
but yeah sure gaston

4069.28 --> 4073.6800000000003
well if if somebody like wants to come

4071.839 --> 4076.799
on as a guest

4073.68 --> 4078.5589999999997
i can do that but i i'd have to have

4076.799 --> 4080.96
some preparation time

4078.559 --> 4081.599
like it's not like oh plop just get in

4080.96 --> 4084.64
there

4081.599 --> 4085.3590000000004
out of nowhere unexpectedly and then

4084.64 --> 4087.44
expect that

4085.359 --> 4090.0789999999997
i'm gonna yeah it's gonna turn out in

4087.44 --> 4092.0
something good and not awkward at all

4090.079 --> 4093.8390000000004
if you want to prevent that if i want to

4092.0 --> 4097.6
prevent it and i do

4093.839 --> 4099.6
then you gotta inform me way ahead

4097.6 --> 4101.759
i gotta have at least a night's sleep

4099.6 --> 4104.96
over it at least

4101.759 --> 4106.96
that's what i need right now because i'm

4104.96 --> 4108.56
not used to it anymore i used to have a

4106.96 --> 4110.2390000000005
lot more guests on

4108.56 --> 4113.04
and then it wouldn't be too much of a

4110.239 --> 4119.839
problem because i was already used to it

4113.04 --> 4119.839
i'm not used to that anymore

4123.359 --> 4147.279
a good one george sanford

4133.6 --> 4161.839
dwayne kellyam no i have not seen that

4147.279 --> 4161.839000000001
that might be interesting to look up

4166.64 --> 4176.400000000001
oh wait i think i have seen that one

4174.56 --> 4178.56
that's like the only balloon footage

4176.4 --> 4181.5199999999995
i've ever seen where there were stars

4178.56 --> 4181.52
visible on it

4184.799 --> 4189.359
but it's kind of the only one i've ever

4186.719 --> 4192.159
seen so

4189.359 --> 4194.08
it really becomes more viable conception

4192.159 --> 4198.48
when there's more

4194.08 --> 4203.5199999999995
examples of it and not just the same guy

4198.48 --> 4205.919999999999
just saying but yeah i have seen that

4203.52 --> 4208.88
i think it was even brought up on the

4205.92 --> 4208.88
flat earth debates

4208.96 --> 4217.84
i'll put the link of it in the chat

4224.64 --> 4229.280000000001
oh pierre carlier okay if you're going

4227.6 --> 4232.4800000000005
to be spamming again then

4229.28 --> 4234.8
i'll just time you out again but

4232.48 --> 4237.04
which laws and that's not how you spell

4234.8 --> 4237.04
that

4237.44 --> 4243.28
right which law second law of

4240.88 --> 4246.400000000001
thermodynamics

4243.28 --> 4248.96
concerning gas pressure it expands in

4246.4 --> 4252.08
all directions

4248.96 --> 4255.04
all right pierre carlier

4252.08 --> 4256.0
i could have deduced that from the name

4255.04 --> 4258.719
i pronounced it

4256.0 --> 4261.52
correctly according to french right so i

4258.719 --> 4261.52
already knew that

4262.719 --> 4266.8
but yeah the second law of

4264.48 --> 4268.32
thermodynamics gas pressure extends in

4266.8 --> 4271.679
all directions to fill

4268.32 --> 4275.28
the confines of the

4271.679 --> 4277.92
available container because it keeps

4275.28 --> 4280.08
expanding until it meets

4277.92 --> 4282.2390000000005
something that stops the expansion which

4280.08 --> 4284.84
would be have to be a strong wall that

4282.239 --> 4287.04
can contain

4284.84 --> 4289.360000000001
gas

4287.04 --> 4291.12
and yeah the heliocentrists say that the

4289.36 --> 4294.4
earth

4291.12 --> 4298.0
is floating suspended

4294.4 --> 4302.799999999999
or moving even in a literally

4298.0 --> 4306.4
endless amount of space endless volume

4302.8 --> 4309.52
endless so that's insane

4306.4 --> 4310.4
so yeah with an endless volume any gas

4309.52 --> 4313.6
pressure that is

4310.4 --> 4316.639999999999
present within it can

4313.6 --> 4318.400000000001
yeah it will all turn to nothing

4316.64 --> 4320.56
because there's an endless amount of

4318.4 --> 4323.759999999999
space and

4320.56 --> 4327.120000000001
yeah the way gas pressure works is

4323.76 --> 4330.2390000000005
that the more vacuous

4327.12 --> 4331.12
the volume is and the bigger the volume

4330.239 --> 4334.639999999999
is

4331.12 --> 4335.84
the more power is behind the gas

4334.64 --> 4338.320000000001
pressures

4335.84 --> 4339.84
expansion in all direction like the gas

4338.32 --> 4343.199
that is released in that

4339.84 --> 4345.04
will violently go in all directions

4343.199 --> 4346.96
the bigger the volume and the lower the

4345.04 --> 4348.8
pressure the more violent the gas

4346.96 --> 4349.84
pressure expansion in all directions

4348.8 --> 4353.6
becomes

4349.84 --> 4356.719
very quick very powerful unstoppable

4353.6 --> 4357.280000000001
so just imagine the ball floating in a

4356.719 --> 4361.44
literal

4357.28 --> 4366.0
endless volume with endless void

4361.44 --> 4366.0
there is no conceivable way even

4366.159 --> 4370.639999999999
virtually even theoretically you can't

4368.56 --> 4374.320000000001
even model this

4370.64 --> 4377.1990000000005
how gas pressure could actually

4374.32 --> 4378.32
stabilize in order for us to breathe on

4377.199 --> 4381.678999999999
the earth

4378.32 --> 4382.96
if the earth was in an hope is an open

4381.679 --> 4386.4800000000005
system

4382.96 --> 4389.679
towards an endless volume with

4386.48 --> 4392.718999999999
endless amounts of vacuum it's

4389.679 --> 4394.88
a brutal violation of the second law of

4392.719 --> 4397.92
thermodynamics

4394.88 --> 4400.400000000001
so yeah that law i hope that clears

4397.92 --> 4400.4
things up

4403.679 --> 4409.76
no that's not the second law of

4405.28 --> 4412.08
thermodynamics that's a description

4409.76 --> 4414.4800000000005
that what you're saying is that's

4412.08 --> 4416.4
somebody's philosophical

4414.48 --> 4418.799999999999
interpretation that's not literally what

4416.4 --> 4418.799999999999
it says

4419.44 --> 4426.48
second law of thermodynamics is

4423.28 --> 4430.0
high pressure to low pressure hot

4426.48 --> 4431.919999999999
to cold that those are the effects

4430.0 --> 4433.28
of entropy which is specifically what

4431.92 --> 4435.92
i'm talking about entropy

4433.28 --> 4437.28
concerning gas pressure that's what i

4435.92 --> 4438.84
mean when i say second law of

4437.28 --> 4441.92
thermodynamics

4438.84 --> 4444.2390000000005
entropy concerning gas pressure because

4441.92 --> 4447.6
there's more than just gas pressure

4444.239 --> 4451.28
to which entropy applies it's also heat

4447.6 --> 4452.84
moving to cold also can be attributed to

4451.28 --> 4455.84
entropy it's the same

4452.84 --> 4457.679
effect right

4455.84 --> 4458.88
so gas pressure expands in all

4457.679 --> 4461.6
directions

4458.88 --> 4464.159000000001
within the confines of the available

4461.6 --> 4464.159000000001
container

4464.96 --> 4468.0
and if the available container is an end

4466.88 --> 4471.12
amount endless

4468.0 --> 4471.12
amount of space

4471.679 --> 4479.36
with no pressure in it with a vacuum and

4475.6 --> 4481.280000000001
it's almost impossible

4479.36 --> 4482.4
vacuum we can't even create that here on

4481.28 --> 4484.159
earth right

4482.4 --> 4486.799999999999
if that's out there and there's nothing

4484.159 --> 4488.799999999999
to prevent the air from

4486.8 --> 4490.320000000001
expanding in all directions because

4488.8 --> 4492.159000000001
gravity is

4490.32 --> 4494.0
it's not going to do it you know even if

4492.159 --> 4496.08
you presume that gravity is some kind of

4494.0 --> 4499.679
a force

4496.08 --> 4504.5599999999995
that force cannot oppose

4499.679 --> 4507.679
the gas pressure expansion power

4504.56 --> 4508.56
that it would have to just slightly push

4507.679 --> 4510.719
against

4508.56 --> 4512.2390000000005
where the gas pressure expansion power

4510.719 --> 4515.28
is well

4512.239 --> 4518.239
infinite because the volume of

4515.28 --> 4520.639999999999
the vacuum out there is infinite so the

4518.239 --> 4524.32
gas pressure expansion power becomes

4520.64 --> 4526.2390000000005
infinite so gravity cannot stop

4524.32 --> 4528.5599999999995
no ma like even if it was a freaking

4526.239 --> 4531.04
black hole gravity

4528.56 --> 4532.719
it would not even stop the gas pressure

4531.04 --> 4535.36
expanding in all directions

4532.719 --> 4536.08
because the volume is infinite and the

4535.36 --> 4538.719
vacuum

4536.08 --> 4539.6
amount is infinite so the gas pressure

4538.719 --> 4543.12
expansion

4539.6 --> 4546.400000000001
power is going to be infinite

4543.12 --> 4548.159
not even a black hole strength gravity

4546.4 --> 4549.679
could stop the gas pressure from

4548.159 --> 4554.08
expanding in all directions

4549.679 --> 4554.08
instantaneous seemingly instantaneously

4555.52 --> 4567.84
right so

4559.28 --> 4567.84
that's that's what happens

4572.88 --> 4576.0
oh really so now you're just gonna

4574.88 --> 4578.64
insert your own

4576.0 --> 4580.64
conceptions of what space is like right

4578.64 --> 4583.84
so it's not a vacuum

4580.64 --> 4587.360000000001
right is it endless though

4583.84 --> 4590.56
because yeah even if it

4587.36 --> 4592.32
wasn't a perfect vacuum whatever that's

4590.56 --> 4594.719
supposed to be

4592.32 --> 4595.679
it would just dramatically less pressure

4594.719 --> 4600.4800000000005
dramatic

4595.679 --> 4600.4800000000005
say it's like 99 percent less pressure

4601.04 --> 4606.159
it's 99 1 of the amount of pressure on

4604.56 --> 4609.84
earth that level of vacuum

4606.159 --> 4610.5599999999995
yeah if it's infinite volume it's still

4609.84 --> 4613.679
going to

4610.56 --> 4616.080000000001
explode with infinite power into all

4613.679 --> 4619.12
directions

4616.08 --> 4621.04
because it still wants to fill

4619.12 --> 4622.32
the volume of the container now it may

4621.04 --> 4626.239
be obstructed

4622.32 --> 4627.679
somewhat from expanding at

4626.239 --> 4629.599999999999
infinite speed because it's not

4627.679 --> 4631.84
surrounded by perfect vacuum just

4629.6 --> 4633.120000000001
one percent pressure that's going to

4631.84 --> 4635.84
cause

4633.12 --> 4638.0
some obstruction maybe so it doesn't

4635.84 --> 4640.8
expanded infinite

4638.0 --> 4643.679
strength but it's still going to be

4640.8 --> 4646.320000000001
absurdly strong and nothing

4643.679 --> 4648.84
can prevent it from expanding in all

4646.32 --> 4651.12
directions so no matter how you put it

4648.84 --> 4654.159000000001
together

4651.12 --> 4654.88
it's not yeah gas pressure cannot stick

4654.159 --> 4657.599999999999
to a ball

4654.88 --> 4659.4400000000005
in an infinite container unless the

4657.6 --> 4662.719
infinite container is filled with

4659.44 --> 4665.5199999999995
infinite amount of atmospheric pressure

4662.719 --> 4666.4800000000005
level pressure like ground level

4665.52 --> 4669.4400000000005
pressure if that

4666.48 --> 4671.678999999999
is an infinite amount available of that

4669.44 --> 4674.96
in the infinite universe

4671.679 --> 4676.88
only then could the gas

4674.96 --> 4678.0
stick to the ball enough for us sort of

4676.88 --> 4679.92
to breathe but not

4678.0 --> 4681.28
really because with infinite amount of

4679.92 --> 4682.96
gas would be infinite amount of

4681.28 --> 4684.8
turbulence

4682.96 --> 4686.64
and there could yeah everything would

4684.8 --> 4689.679
wreck

4686.64 --> 4692.4800000000005
so it's untenable

4689.679 --> 4695.36
you're not living on a ball you can't

4692.48 --> 4699.36
theoretically even be living on a bell

4695.36 --> 4701.44
it's impossible unless

4699.36 --> 4706.239
yeah unless you concede that we're not

4701.44 --> 4708.719
in an infinite container

4706.239 --> 4710.32
and then suddenly yeah who knows if

4708.719 --> 4713.84
you're going to overlook that the earth

4710.32 --> 4717.12
has no curvature whatsoever

4713.84 --> 4718.400000000001
whatsoever it's very flat black swan you

4717.12 --> 4720.8
can see way too far

4718.4 --> 4723.199
for the required geometry of the earth

4720.8 --> 4727.28
to be a ball

4723.199 --> 4729.759999999999
but hey you could potentially maneuver

4727.28 --> 4732.5599999999995
yourself into believing

4729.76 --> 4734.88
that the earth is of all and then

4732.56 --> 4736.88
surrounded by a container or

4734.88 --> 4739.04
i don't know in a container box and

4736.88 --> 4741.4400000000005
floating in the middle of it

4739.04 --> 4743.36
and then i don't know that box is

4741.44 --> 4748.239
looping in on itself i don't know i

4743.36 --> 4752.719
conceived this when i was freaking 17.

4748.239 --> 4754.799999999999
so yeah then suddenly oh wait maybe

4752.719 --> 4756.88
we can then have gas pressure on the

4754.8 --> 4761.1990000000005
ball but this

4756.88 --> 4764.719
infinite space is impossible

4761.199 --> 4768.5599999999995
impossible can never

4764.719 --> 4771.84
in any way exist in any way

4768.56 --> 4775.1990000000005
there can never be infinite space and

4771.84 --> 4777.76
never ever in physical reality in

4775.199 --> 4779.04
any conceivable way it can never be

4777.76 --> 4791.84
possible

4779.04 --> 4791.84
you understand

4792.08 --> 4797.92
no no i don't need no

4795.36 --> 4800.32
just no i don't need people with those

4797.92 --> 4801.92
kind of comments

4800.32 --> 4804.159
people that don't say that are just

4801.92 --> 4807.52
basically saying no

4804.159 --> 4811.36
no it's not possible yeah it is possible

4807.52 --> 4811.360000000001
get over it get over yourself

4829.199 --> 4836.48
so in mirage you know what it is oh

4832.719 --> 4840.4800000000005
pierre oh pierre wants to get

4836.48 --> 4840.48
wants to get kicked in the bum again

4840.8 --> 4844.0
what a mirage what you don't know what a

4842.8 --> 4847.6
freaking mirage is

4844.0 --> 4851.6
did you know that mirages

4847.6 --> 4855.1990000000005
can never the mirage is always

4851.6 --> 4859.120000000001
in relation to the horizon

4855.199 --> 4861.839999999999
and the mirage can never displace

4859.12 --> 4861.84
the horizon

4862.639 --> 4868.32
yeah so your idea of terrestrial

4865.76 --> 4871.280000000001
refraction

4868.32 --> 4872.159
the horizon is the geometrical horizon

4871.28 --> 4874.88
is not

4872.159 --> 4875.28
where the apparent horizon is because

4874.88 --> 4878.639
it's

4875.28 --> 4881.759999999999
all being miraged

4878.639 --> 4885.04
right that's impossible that's not

4881.76 --> 4888.2390000000005
optics the horizon can never

4885.04 --> 4891.199
be displaced by

4888.239 --> 4894.08
miraging type effects that's a physical

4891.199 --> 4894.08
impossibility

4896.32 --> 4903.92
only the diffraction limit can hide

4900.719 --> 4904.88
things from sight in relation to the

4903.92 --> 4908.639
horizon

4904.88 --> 4912.32
and then refraction effects may displace

4908.639 --> 4914.2390000000005
imagery of objects in relation to the

4912.32 --> 4916.48
horizon

4914.239 --> 4918.4
those objects may be displaced but the

4916.48 --> 4922.239
horizon will not be displaced

4918.4 --> 4922.239
there's no proof of that that can happen

4922.639 --> 4929.6
right so yeah terrestrial refraction

4926.719 --> 4932.0
besides being a paradox if you want to

4929.6 --> 4933.280000000001
use it to establish the radius of earth

4932.0 --> 4934.96
which is kind of what you're trying to

4933.28 --> 4936.08
do isn't it that the earth is a sphere

4934.96 --> 4937.679
the radius

4936.08 --> 4939.28
and you're saying terrestrial refraction

4937.679 --> 4941.12
without saying terrestrial refraction

4939.28 --> 4943.199
but i know that's what you mean because

4941.12 --> 4945.599999999999
that is what you're describing when you

4943.199 --> 4946.638999999999
say mirage that's the only reason to

4945.6 --> 4949.280000000001
bring that up

4946.639 --> 4950.88
it's the only reason to mention that is

4949.28 --> 4951.599999999999
because you want to insert terrestrial

4950.88 --> 4955.679
refraction

4951.6 --> 4959.360000000001
well it's a paradox if terrestrial

4955.679 --> 4962.56
refraction existed then

4959.36 --> 4964.639
the radius which is part

4962.56 --> 4966.719
its presupposed by terrestrial

4964.639 --> 4969.6
refraction could never have been

4966.719 --> 4970.4
established if terrestrial refraction

4969.6 --> 4972.96
exists

4970.4 --> 4973.599999999999
the radius which is a fundamental part

4972.96 --> 4975.76
of

4973.6 --> 4977.280000000001
the formula could have never been

4975.76 --> 4980.320000000001
established

4977.28 --> 4980.639
it's a paradox terrestrial refraction is

4980.32 --> 4982.799999999999
a

4980.639 --> 4984.0
is a science fiction construct it's a

4982.8 --> 4986.639
malformation of

4984.0 --> 4988.0
optics in order to help you presuppose

4986.639 --> 5001.3
the earth is a globe

4988.0 --> 5004.64
which it isn't

5001.3 --> 5004.64
[Music]

5026.84 --> 5029.84
so

5030.239 --> 5033.36
now iron fe look every time you say it

5032.48 --> 5035.839999999999
you have to say

5033.36 --> 5036.799999999999
terrestrial refraction because

5035.84 --> 5041.1990000000005
refraction

5036.8 --> 5044.4800000000005
is actual optics as well it is involved

5041.199 --> 5044.879999999999
it's just that these effects that come

5044.48 --> 5047.839999999999
from

5044.88 --> 5049.92
refraction which yeah they exist it's

5047.84 --> 5052.2390000000005
like the mirages

5049.92 --> 5053.84
the visual displacements they have a

5052.239 --> 5056.0
specific way they function

5053.84 --> 5057.28
proven empirically proven to function

5056.0 --> 5059.84
that way

5057.28 --> 5061.28
that's actual refraction that exists

5059.84 --> 5064.639
inherent part to sight

5061.28 --> 5066.8
and optics but their refraction

5064.639 --> 5068.159000000001
is terrestrial refraction that's the

5066.8 --> 5069.84
official title

5068.159 --> 5072.799999999999
and it's something completely different

5069.84 --> 5075.28
it has nothing to do with actual optics

5072.8 --> 5075.92
and presupposes are so every time you

5075.28 --> 5079.84
mention

5075.92 --> 5082.0
that you should call it terrestrial

5079.84 --> 5084.400000000001
refraction even though the globus

5082.0 --> 5088.08
themselves may leave the terrestrial

5084.4 --> 5090.159
out of it it's important that we

5088.08 --> 5092.0
because we know it is terrestrial

5090.159 --> 5095.199
refraction we spell it out

5092.0 --> 5099.84
every time we we bring it up

5095.199 --> 5099.839999999999
as flat earthers okay guys

5124.84 --> 5127.84
so

5136.719 --> 5140.8
in a plane there is turbulence but in

5138.88 --> 5145.04
general other transports you feel

5140.8 --> 5147.92
nothing wow i don't know what that means

5145.04 --> 5149.6
but it's not true you know how fast

5147.92 --> 5152.56
planes fly

5149.6 --> 5153.04
you know what you feel when you drive in

5152.56 --> 5155.84
a car

5153.04 --> 5157.76
going that speed oh yeah you're going to

5155.84 --> 5160.96
feel some freaking turbulence all right

5157.76 --> 5162.719
it's going to shake your car now it

5160.96 --> 5165.36
might have a lot of aerodynamics but so

5162.719 --> 5167.44
do planes but still the oscillation

5165.36 --> 5169.5199999999995
that starts to happen when you go really

5167.44 --> 5170.799999999999
fast you will experience that at the

5169.52 --> 5173.84
ground as well

5170.8 --> 5176.159000000001
now of course good trains

5173.84 --> 5178.400000000001
are specifically designed to go in a

5176.159 --> 5180.159
very straight path and kind of avoid it

5178.4 --> 5183.5199999999995
as much as possible

5180.159 --> 5185.28
but separated vehicles like cars

5183.52 --> 5187.280000000001
even though they can get very fast they

5185.28 --> 5189.759999999999
you will feel the freaking turbulence

5187.28 --> 5190.5599999999995
when you go extremely fast which is what

5189.76 --> 5193.679
planes do

5190.56 --> 5194.84
they go very fast you got to realize

5193.679 --> 5197.84
that

5194.84 --> 5197.84
so

5199.51 --> 5202.9490000000005
[Music]

5215.28 --> 5220.5599999999995
yeah what

5218.48 --> 5222.04
i'm just going by what you said which is

5220.56 --> 5225.04
just

5222.04 --> 5229.76
self-contained and wrong

5225.04 --> 5229.76
i just explained that pierre carlier

5231.44 --> 5235.839999999999
you bring an argument and i disprove

5233.44 --> 5236.48
that argument so yeah you lost that's

5235.84 --> 5238.639
right

5236.48 --> 5241.04
then don't make statements that are just

5238.639 --> 5245.1990000000005
easily falsified

5241.04 --> 5247.199
just wrong don't say such things

5245.199 --> 5249.759999999999
if you don't want me to point out that

5247.199 --> 5249.759999999999
you're wrong

5250.4 --> 5255.36
think about what you're saying before

5252.4 --> 5255.36
you're gonna say it

5257.36 --> 5265.199
you should because you got some bad

5260.88 --> 5266.88
habits in your way of talking

5265.199 --> 5268.719
got some bad assumptions in there and

5266.88 --> 5270.4800000000005
then you gotta pay attention to prevent

5268.719 --> 5273.04
them from slipping in

5270.48 --> 5274.718999999999
i don't need so much attention on that

5273.04 --> 5277.04
anymore because i got most of the bad

5274.719 --> 5278.88
habits out

5277.04 --> 5282.8
that's what makes people like you and

5278.88 --> 5282.8
others and chad squirt so much

5284.719 --> 5287.679
because you're being confronted with

5286.08 --> 5295.84
your bad habits that you don't want to

5287.679 --> 5295.84
realize you have

5306.84 --> 5309.84
thanks

5318.8 --> 5323.360000000001
turbulence is not the same as speed of a

5322.32 --> 5325.759999999999
plane

5323.36 --> 5326.88
right well turbulence is just a natural

5325.76 --> 5330.56
effect and

5326.88 --> 5332.639
what is it when you hit high pressure

5330.56 --> 5334.4800000000005
air for example i think that's when

5332.639 --> 5336.4800000000005
turbulence really sets in because that's

5334.48 --> 5338.0
what it is it's kind of an oscillation

5336.48 --> 5343.04
that happens

5338.0 --> 5343.04
from heavy friction

5343.6 --> 5348.159000000001
and that can absolutely happen at ground

5345.84 --> 5349.92
level if you're going insanely fast now

5348.159 --> 5350.879999999999
most people that go insanely fast do it

5349.92 --> 5352.8
like in the

5350.88 --> 5354.2390000000005
in some kind of desert because then you

5352.8 --> 5356.719
don't have

5354.239 --> 5358.159
as much air pressure friction causing

5356.719 --> 5359.44
turbulence because turbulence is

5358.159 --> 5362.239
dangerous

5359.44 --> 5362.799999999999
something turbulates turbulences out of

5362.239 --> 5365.04
control

5362.8 --> 5366.400000000001
a car then suddenly comes crash bang

5365.04 --> 5369.76
splat

5366.4 --> 5371.679
or planes don't have a risk to basically

5369.76 --> 5373.84
crash into the ground because they're

5371.679 --> 5374.719
mid-air so turbulence affects them

5373.84 --> 5376.56
slightly less

5374.719 --> 5378.719
but it can potentially break the thing

5376.56 --> 5381.1990000000005
apart the structure integrity can't

5378.719 --> 5381.199
handle it

5389.679 --> 5395.92
but yeah if you're gonna like grace

5391.76 --> 5398.96
super fast and not in a desert but like

5395.92 --> 5401.6
i don't know on a special white

5398.96 --> 5402.08
paved road that is like i don't know

5401.6 --> 5405.280000000001
through

5402.08 --> 5407.6
in louisiana for example in swamp

5405.28 --> 5412.0
country

5407.6 --> 5415.280000000001
yeah you betcha the car is gonna

5412.0 --> 5417.52
experience turbulence

5415.28 --> 5419.759999999999
much more than it will when driving the

5417.52 --> 5421.6
same speed like in the desert

5419.76 --> 5422.88
because the air is a lot thicker there's

5421.6 --> 5423.6
more moist in there there's more

5422.88 --> 5426.4800000000005
friction

5423.6 --> 5427.84
so there will be more turbulence this is

5426.48 --> 5430.08
how turbulence works

5427.84 --> 5430.08
see

5432.08 --> 5435.12
and even if that effect is not called

5434.08 --> 5439.12
turbulence then

5435.12 --> 5439.12
the way i described it will still happen

5446.639 --> 5453.6
why do pilots pass out if the cabin

5450.159 --> 5453.599999999999
loses air compression

5460.84 --> 5465.92
uh

5463.04 --> 5468.239
why is that it's just very low pressure

5465.92 --> 5477.84
right up there usually

5468.239 --> 5477.839999999999
at the heights that they fly

5480.4 --> 5484.719
but i think compression also has to do

5482.8 --> 5489.1990000000005
with

5484.719 --> 5491.12
yeah the counter pressure against the

5489.199 --> 5493.199
the still remaining air pressure even

5491.12 --> 5496.159
though lower outside

5493.199 --> 5496.879999999999
that because of the speed is still

5496.159 --> 5499.599999999999
pressing

5496.88 --> 5500.0
extra hard onto the plane so i think

5499.6 --> 5504.159000000001
it's

5500.0 --> 5505.12
meant as counter pressure to i don't

5504.159 --> 5507.28
know

5505.12 --> 5508.239
make the forces of the pressure from the

5507.28 --> 5510.159
air rushing

5508.239 --> 5512.08
against the plane or the plane rushing

5510.159 --> 5516.48
against it

5512.08 --> 5519.28
to counteract that pressure

5516.48 --> 5522.959999999999
that's why they blow it up with pressure

5519.28 --> 5522.96
on the inside i think that's the reason

5528.719 --> 5533.84
it still reinforced the structural

5530.84 --> 5533.84
integrity

5536.639 --> 5540.2390000000005
all right anyway i'm gonna round out the

5538.32 --> 5543.599999999999
show

5540.239 --> 5545.36
so thanks everyone for coming if you

it's over there

5563.84 --> 5571.679
uh yeah i will be back tomorrow with

flat earth early bird number

5572.84 --> 5577.1990000000005
674

5574.719 --> 5580.0
oh there somebody's having a last minute

5577.199 --> 5580.0
squirt are they

5580.719 --> 5584.32
and yeah i just wanted to say haven't i

5583.04 --> 5587.44
been so

5584.32 --> 5590.639
incredibly polite to abolish recently

5587.44 --> 5592.799999999999
i'm pretty surprised but they they still

5590.639 --> 5594.08
tend to have like if they're being

5592.8 --> 5596.4800000000005
ignored

5594.08 --> 5598.719
at the end then they scored and like go

5596.48 --> 5602.159
in at home anyway it's very typical

5598.719 --> 5605.36
very sad

5602.159 --> 5608.32
oh they're all having lots of trouble

5605.36 --> 5610.5599999999995
dealing dealing with me coping with what

5608.32 --> 5614.719
i'm confronting them with

5610.56 --> 5618.56
yeah well next time new chances for you

5614.719 --> 5623.36
but i'm yeah ending the show so uh

5618.56 --> 5623.360000000001
until the next video keep it
