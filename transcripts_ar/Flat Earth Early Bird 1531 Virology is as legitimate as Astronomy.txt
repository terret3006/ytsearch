starting late

89.159 --> 91.93900000000001
half hour late

92.4 --> 96.42
weather today I don't know it started

94.74 --> 97.74
out kind of nice but now it's become

96.42 --> 100.32000000000001
like this

97.74 --> 105.119
gray or rather white soup

100.32 --> 107.77999999999999
up there also see remnants of trails

105.119 --> 107.78
I didn't know

108.18 --> 114.619
it seems overall pretty wind still but

111.06 --> 114.619
it's it's still kind of chilly

116.64 --> 119.84
so yeah

126.619 --> 133.5
it's Monday the 6th of March 2023

135.84 --> 139.68
[Music]

137.64 --> 141.05999999999997
right so yeah yesterday's show was

139.68 --> 142.44
probably the shortest show I've ever

141.06 --> 145.81900000000002
done

142.44 --> 145.819
but yeah I felt

147.06 --> 151.02
well as I was doing the show I thought

148.86 --> 153.36
like no this this could work and then

151.02 --> 155.76000000000002
yeah well in the moment that I ran out I

153.36 --> 157.62
became really heavily nauseated like

155.76 --> 160.85999999999999
almost throwing up

157.62 --> 163.37900000000002
just attention subtly like move there

160.86 --> 166.37900000000002
and it's like oh this is like that can

163.379 --> 169.14
never be fixed today

166.379 --> 172.819
I thought at first like yeah maybe like

169.14 --> 172.819
in two hours or something but no

172.98 --> 176.72
let's just kind of people the whole day

176.819 --> 182.57999999999998
so I took it easy I actually went for a

179.64 --> 184.2
walk in the park it wasn't it even

182.58 --> 187.26000000000002
rained a little but

184.2 --> 191.66
it was still like good to like

187.26 --> 191.66
moving and get like maximum fresh air

192.42 --> 198.54
take a look at all the birds around

195.48 --> 202.5
I saw a woodpecker like super up close

198.54 --> 205.2
it must have been like within 10 meters

202.5 --> 206.819
I heard it first it was like whoa

205.2 --> 209.099
really loud

206.819 --> 211.73899999999998
was pecking

209.099 --> 215.099
but it was right next to me

211.739 --> 216.659
that was funny to see that

215.099 --> 221.29999999999998
right

216.659 --> 221.29999999999998
but yeah overall pretty chill day and

223.86 --> 227.42000000000002
mostly uneventful

230.34 --> 234.68
yeah caught up on Owen Benjamin

235.28 --> 240.5
huh it's pretty cool like being on the

238.56 --> 243.42000000000002
uh

240.5 --> 247.819
unauthorized.tv because I like get to

243.42 --> 247.819
see all the streams now like all of them

248.879 --> 252.89999999999998
and it's much quicker so I'm I'm kind of

251.159 --> 255.54
happy doing that

252.9 --> 257.04
I'm also been carefully starting to look

255.54 --> 258.65999999999997
around because there's other people

257.04 --> 262.699
there too

258.66 --> 262.699
but I haven't really gotten very far

273.36 --> 279.199
right

274.759 --> 279.199
also called my healer this morning

281.58 --> 285.9
because I really needed it I I needed it

284.759 --> 288.36
yesterday

285.9 --> 291.23999999999995
I even needed it Saturday but it just

288.36 --> 293.36
yeah he's not really available in the

291.24 --> 293.36
weekend

293.52 --> 299.03999999999996
but he gave me some tips and insights

296.699 --> 301.86
that I was like shocked like how I

299.04 --> 304.94
hadn't actually just

301.86 --> 304.94
thought of that myself

305.419 --> 310.44
concerning yeah like

307.919 --> 313.25899999999996
well what he does he basically told me

310.44 --> 315.78
like look when I say these certain

313.259 --> 318.24
things that's not some kind of magic

315.78 --> 319.38
that I do it's like you can literally do

318.24 --> 322.56
that too

319.38 --> 324.71999999999997
you just have to focus in in such a

322.56 --> 327.06
moment like

324.72 --> 331.199
so I am going to

327.06 --> 334.34
actually more actively try that out

331.199 --> 337.32
because yeah sometimes it's just like

334.34 --> 340.08
metaphorically metaphysically the zoo

337.32 --> 341.699
inside like what happened yesterday it

340.08 --> 343.8
just becomes too much all of a sudden

341.699 --> 347.28000000000003
it's like they all go stampeding and

343.8 --> 350.52000000000004
they just go right through the fence

347.28 --> 353.58
and then

350.52 --> 355.979
in the state that I get into after that

353.58 --> 358.85999999999996
it's like defense is just broken and the

355.979 --> 362.88
animals are running around Wild

358.86 --> 365.58000000000004
I'm still managing to like not go insane

362.88 --> 368.52
but it's like my impulses on the inside

365.58 --> 370.85999999999996
are gonna be going insane and gonna be

368.52 --> 373.32
like extremely emotional on average

370.86 --> 376.38
basically

373.32 --> 378.84
including self-punishment

376.38 --> 381.56
which unfortunately I have a very strong

378.84 --> 381.56
streak off

382.02 --> 387.0
right

383.699 --> 390.24
but if I do these techniques

387.0 --> 392.58
basically I basically just asking

390.24 --> 396.0
just asking like put my

392.58 --> 399.06
my spirit back in my body

396.0 --> 400.919
but we're with a very specific Focus

399.06 --> 402.9
it's like I can't explain I have to try

400.919 --> 405.0
it out first because I've tried to

402.9 --> 407.15999999999997
emulate my healer even by my own

405.0 --> 409.4
initiative in the past

407.16 --> 413.819
but it would be like

409.4 --> 417.419
I see it I'd see it in such a moment and

413.819 --> 420.41900000000004
it's like wait I I can't just do that

417.419 --> 423.71999999999997
but when you're all caught up well most

420.419 --> 426.35999999999996
of the time I don't see it at all

423.72 --> 427.199
I'm just like stuck in a nightmare type

426.36 --> 429.78000000000003
of

427.199 --> 433.02000000000004
roughly described type of feeling and

429.78 --> 435.539
it's like I don't get an accent

433.02 --> 438.59999999999997
I need certainly somebody else

435.539 --> 440.699
to help me show that exit

438.6 --> 443.88
and my healer's been like the best

440.699 --> 446.639
person for that ever

443.88 --> 449.819
like better than my dad better than

446.639 --> 452.699
anybody else I've ever met

449.819 --> 455.88
foreign

452.699 --> 461.06
but I might be able to learn it myself

455.88 --> 461.06
if just not for myself and who knows man

462.319 --> 467.599
because I really want to get this thing

465.12 --> 467.599
under control

467.88 --> 471.419
I mean the way I just flipped out

469.919 --> 473.0
Saturday

471.419 --> 475.62
it got bad

473.0 --> 477.599
why did it got bad because it got re

475.62 --> 480.539
well mixed

477.599 --> 482.58
it literally became a giant soup and I

480.539 --> 484.56
started to throw out accusations that

482.58 --> 488.039
were sort of meant

484.56 --> 491.96
at you guys but at the same time not

488.039 --> 491.96
so it was like kind of just

493.099 --> 500.819
addressing a mash not really individuals

498.0 --> 503.46
I I don't know I I tend to do this more

500.819 --> 505.319
often when I get a little rage Winnie

503.46 --> 507.06
unless it's really about an individual

505.319 --> 508.86
but usually I don't

507.06 --> 512.64
no I don't go rage win over an

508.86 --> 515.0
individual I just get angry it's not the

512.64 --> 515.0
same thing

516.719 --> 519.32
but

520.38 --> 527.399
it's just a lot of ugliness and resent

523.68 --> 530.9399999999999
negativity like it is really negative

527.399 --> 533.339
like that's really not good

530.94 --> 535.6800000000001
like it might be interesting it might be

533.339 --> 537.48
like oh it'll snap you out of whatever

535.68 --> 540.899
you're doing or something

537.48 --> 544.32
but positive it was not it was honest

540.899 --> 546.42
but it wasn't positive so is that

544.32 --> 549.74
good then

546.42 --> 549.74
honest negativity

552.0 --> 557.16
I wonder sometimes it is confrontational

555.0 --> 559.98
and everybody in the freaking world

557.16 --> 562.0799999999999
typically tries to avoid it

559.98 --> 564.0600000000001
with people they like and when they

562.08 --> 565.74
don't like somebody then they always do

564.06 --> 568.26
that

565.74 --> 569.399
anyway hello tiger bear first in Chad

568.26 --> 571.86
the studio

569.399 --> 573.12
Ray twin

571.86 --> 575.4590000000001
yeah

573.12 --> 578.4590000000001
well it wasn't fun to me

575.459 --> 580.9799999999999
no Studio it really wasn't

578.459 --> 582.779
I mean when I get a little intense and

580.98 --> 585.24
maybe slightly angry

582.779 --> 587.54
you could call that rage win

585.24 --> 589.86
but yesterday was just like a blowout

587.54 --> 591.3
that was just me getting really

589.86 --> 595.14
Insidious

591.3 --> 597.5999999999999
and yeah you can call that Ray twin but

595.14 --> 599.519
that isn't entertaining I mean it might

597.6 --> 600.83
be entertaining to you guys but to me

599.519 --> 603.48
it's really suffering

600.83 --> 605.94
[Music]

603.48 --> 610.74
deliver your section is that okay the

605.94 --> 610.74
studio is not exactly new but yeah

612.6 --> 617.399
I've heard that phrase since like 2017.

619.62 --> 623.48
not a big fan though I mean I don't want

621.72 --> 626.72
to direct sexuality into it

623.48 --> 626.72
unnecessarily so

627.13 --> 630.33
[Music]

632.22 --> 636.899
but there is something to it I mean

634.64 --> 639.62
subconsciously they do try to play on

636.899 --> 639.62
sexuality

640.38 --> 643.88
anyway how are you doing

643.92 --> 647.6999999999999
uh

646.24 --> 650.16
[Music]

647.7 --> 652.019
right so yeah the whole Brenda situation

650.16 --> 653.8199999999999
I think I brought it up yesterday very

652.019 --> 656.339
quickly

653.82 --> 659.22
that I was gonna get her on because I

656.339 --> 661.0790000000001
invited her and then well I invited

659.22 --> 664.5600000000001
during my rage win and she took that

661.079 --> 666.18
invitation but she freaking insisted we

664.56 --> 668.76
talk about flat earth when I

666.18 --> 670.4399999999999
specifically didn't want that and she

668.76 --> 672.18
insisted so much that she basically

670.44 --> 675.9590000000001
canceled

672.18 --> 679.3199999999999
can't believe how did I'm disappointed I

675.959 --> 681.779
was actually call me crazy

679.32 --> 684.72
I was actually looking forward to like

681.779 --> 687.0
talking in a more civil way

684.72 --> 690.72
with her

687.0 --> 694.079
about that but the transsexuality and

690.72 --> 696.12
all that like and not get in the

694.079 --> 698.0999999999999
shouting match because she won't show no

696.12 --> 699.9590000000001
she insists talking about flat earth oh

698.1 --> 701.94
yeah well I know what that means I know

699.959 --> 704.579
that's going to be whining and

701.94 --> 709.2
complaining about myth and Oak Leonor if

704.579 --> 712.3199999999999
she would absolutely 100 guarantee do

709.2 --> 714.779
that and she could go [ __ ] herself to

712.32 --> 718.9200000000001
death I don't give a [ __ ]

714.779 --> 720.18
I'm not gonna sit through that with that

718.92 --> 723.4799999999999
person

720.18 --> 725.579
because it's [ __ ] demonic and it's a

723.48 --> 728.82
lie and it's gross and it's not a

725.579 --> 731.279
pleasant conversation to have I want to

728.82 --> 733.5
talk about something else but she

731.279 --> 735.54
apparently she can't oh she has to talk

733.5 --> 738.12
about Flat Earth with me oh yeah well go

735.54 --> 740.64
[ __ ] yourself then Brenda I don't want

738.12 --> 742.26
to talk about Flat Earth with you you

740.64 --> 744.06
crazy [ __ ]

742.26 --> 747.24
I wanted to actually talk about

744.06 --> 750.4799999999999
something more personal

747.24 --> 754.5
right I specifically stated I don't want

750.48 --> 757.74
to get into stuff that's gonna

754.5 --> 759.6
get friction or agitate I want it to be

757.74 --> 762.72
a civil conversation but I guess the

759.6 --> 764.82
Brenda just can't do that Brenna can't

762.72 --> 768.3000000000001
have a civil conversation she just has

764.82 --> 771.3000000000001
to bicker and whine and manipulate

768.3 --> 772.5
she doesn't have it under control so too

771.3 --> 775.1999999999999
bad

772.5 --> 780.09
I thought maybe I could just show a more

775.2 --> 792.0
positive side of you arguably or neutral

780.09 --> 792.0
[Music]

795.18 --> 798.26
okay fine

802.68 --> 806.42
I don't know why that keeps happening

806.7 --> 813.139
this is so disruptive I don't know why

809.639 --> 813.139
that keeps happening recently

815.279 --> 819.959
there's OBS just suddenly starts dying

817.8 --> 824.4799999999999
in the middle of something heated

819.959 --> 824.4799999999999
like what the [ __ ] is that

824.579 --> 829.04
why can't I just have

827.399 --> 831.56
a stream

829.04 --> 833.12
uninterrupted every time something

831.56 --> 835.92
actually

833.12 --> 838.5600000000001
flowing happens it's like every time it

835.92 --> 842.7199999999999
just tries to Blake break my flow

838.56 --> 842.7199999999999
I'm so [ __ ] sick of that [ __ ]

848.06 --> 853.5
calling Rooney I don't give a [ __ ]

850.68 --> 856.5
what's the curve I don't give a [ __ ] I

853.5 --> 859.74
prefer to call her a she because I know

856.5 --> 862.86
what she looks like and if I have to if

859.74 --> 865.62
I'm going to be forced to look at that

862.86 --> 868.38
and think it's a man it's a man that's a

865.62 --> 870.66
yeah that's gonna [ __ ] me up okay so I'd

868.38 --> 873.0
prefer to think of her as just

870.66 --> 874.86
some crazy

873.0 --> 876.6
ugly middle-aged woman

874.86 --> 880.019
okay

876.6 --> 881.399
I'm very much to perfect think prefer to

880.019 --> 884.279
think of her

881.399 --> 887.279
like a she because if I had to look at

884.279 --> 889.92
that and then know in in while looking

887.279 --> 892.74
that that's a man I get [ __ ]

889.92 --> 894.4799999999999
nauseated so thanks but no thanks

892.74 --> 896.88
where's the Curve

894.48 --> 899.519
I don't give a [ __ ] if I'm gonna feed

896.88 --> 902.04
into her delusion who gives a [ __ ] about

899.519 --> 904.98
her delusion she's never coming out of

902.04 --> 906.779
that [ __ ] delusion okay who gives a

904.98 --> 909.32
[ __ ] what she does

906.779 --> 912.3
she can't even have a normal

909.32 --> 915.4200000000001
non-bickering conversation

912.3 --> 917.3389999999999
who gives a [ __ ] if I'm gonna feed into

915.42 --> 921.199
her delusion

917.339 --> 921.1990000000001
like that's ever gonna be stuck

921.42 --> 924.42
okay

928.38 --> 934.05
[Music]

931.5 --> 935.399
like why the [ __ ] does it even matter

934.05 --> 938.639
[Music]

935.399 --> 942.3
yeah why does it matter if I call some

938.639 --> 944.88
middle-aged crazy old idiot

942.3 --> 947.3389999999999
a she or not

944.88 --> 951.26
it's an old person who gives a [ __ ]

947.339 --> 951.2600000000001
seriously who gives a [ __ ]

951.42 --> 955.74
yeah

952.98 --> 958.62
she's obviously not the father of some

955.74 --> 960.24
family that she's shaming through what

958.62 --> 961.74
she's doing

960.24 --> 964.62
okay

961.74 --> 966.48
like a fam like her kids and all that I

964.62 --> 968.579
mean she probably does have some family

966.48 --> 971.22
like brothers or sisters or something

968.579 --> 974.399
cousins but

971.22 --> 976.74
that doesn't matter yeah I mean if it's

974.399 --> 980.459
some teenager that's like no I'm

976.74 --> 982.32
actually he she whatever black yeah then

980.459 --> 983.699
you shouldn't be playing into those

982.32 --> 985.6800000000001
delusions

983.699 --> 987.5999999999999
because they're young confused they

985.68 --> 989.88
might

987.6 --> 992.339
do something because of that that

989.88 --> 993.779
they're gonna basically regret the rest

992.339 --> 996.48
of their lives

993.779 --> 999.0
mutilate themselves yeah that's when you

996.48 --> 1002.72
shouldn't feed into their delusion

999.0 --> 1004.759
if it's some freaking old person who

1002.72 --> 1007.22
gives a [ __ ]

1004.759 --> 1010.1800000000001
let them be whatever the [ __ ] they want

1007.22 --> 1010.1800000000001
as long as they don't

1010.759 --> 1014.779
like

1011.959 --> 1015.9799999999999
talk they're crazy [ __ ] to younger

1014.779 --> 1017.66
people

1015.98 --> 1019.759
yeah

1017.66 --> 1022.459
because it's about protecting the youth

1019.759 --> 1026.059
it's not about oh we have we can't let

1022.459 --> 1028.22
her be in her delusion yeah you can you

1026.059 --> 1031.699
[ __ ] well can

1028.22 --> 1033.98
okay it's about protecting the youth

1031.699 --> 1036.439
if there's some young person that's into

1033.98 --> 1039.319
this that's when you should not play

1036.439 --> 1042.76
into the delusion because they could

1039.319 --> 1045.5
snap out of it they are still

1042.76 --> 1048.5
potential procreators

1045.5 --> 1051.14
and builders that you want to get them

1048.5 --> 1052.94
out of it so they can actually manifest

1051.14 --> 1055.2800000000002
and have a life

1052.94 --> 1057.02
yeah when there's some old person who

1055.28 --> 1058.46
gives a [ __ ]

1057.02 --> 1060.62
who gives the [ __ ] they often already

1058.46 --> 1062.179
had a life and then this is what they

1060.62 --> 1064.8799999999999
want to do

1062.179 --> 1066.74
right or they're just

1064.88 --> 1070.5200000000002
crazy old people

1066.74 --> 1072.86
older people like no longer really young

1070.52 --> 1076.36
then it doesn't really matter

1072.86 --> 1076.36
like who gives you [ __ ]

1077.179 --> 1083.5
you didn't know she you didn't she's

1079.58 --> 1083.5
like 50 or something

1085.82 --> 1090.2
I mean that's not the voice of a young

1088.22 --> 1093.38
woman or man

1090.2 --> 1096.02
the studio you gotta realize that I mean

1093.38 --> 1098.0800000000002
where's the curve I mean the studio gets

1096.02 --> 1098.08
it

1102.08 --> 1106.6399999999999
right and by the way I've caught her

1104.0 --> 1110.059
also saying that she's very much this is

1106.64 --> 1112.72
on gym pops my ways like months ago she

1110.059 --> 1115.22
got on Jim Bob's too which is weird

1112.72 --> 1117.5
multiple times

1115.22 --> 1119.96
but she's even stated that she's very

1117.5 --> 1122.36
much against pedophilia

1119.96 --> 1126.5
like she has a hatred for them

1122.36 --> 1128.6599999999999
and she's against like trans children

1126.5 --> 1129.74
I think

1128.66 --> 1132.2
or

1129.74 --> 1134.059
at least she's I don't know maybe she's

1132.2 --> 1136.94
changed that around but she didn't she

1134.059 --> 1137.8999999999999
did it seemed like rational about that

1136.94 --> 1140.179
part

1137.9 --> 1142.2800000000002
and that's also what made me like okay

1140.179 --> 1144.74
then I actually want to know about your

1142.28 --> 1146.66
trance thing because it's not just Satan

1144.74 --> 1149.6
virus just pure

1146.66 --> 1150.919
uh we gotta ruin everything and and

1149.6 --> 1153.1999999999998
spread it around

1150.919 --> 1154.94
she doesn't so she's like a personal

1153.2 --> 1159.26
decision

1154.94 --> 1161.24
I've met multiple people like that

1159.26 --> 1163.28
that were like that and I really

1161.24 --> 1165.6200000000001
respected them

1163.28 --> 1168.08
was a bit freaky

1165.62 --> 1169.82
but they were not deranged they were

1168.08 --> 1173.1999999999998
often like very

1169.82 --> 1173.2
well thought out people

1175.22 --> 1179.419
and I mean there's probably some crazy

1177.08 --> 1183.32
trainees out there but I just they would

1179.419 --> 1187.2800000000002
never get close to me like physically

1183.32 --> 1190.039
even like those people I scare them

1187.28 --> 1193.96
because they know they're insane

1190.039 --> 1193.96
and I make them feel that

1194.72 --> 1198.98
and I don't accept it I don't play along

1197.059 --> 1200.48
with that that's like the same as like

1198.98 --> 1203.66
the gay

1200.48 --> 1205.7
Vibe the gay way of doing things I do

1203.66 --> 1208.64
not accept it

1205.7 --> 1210.14
so there's it's it's complicated

1208.64 --> 1212.8400000000001
but I think there's a big difference

1210.14 --> 1217.039
between people that are like trans for

1212.84 --> 1220.6999999999998
themselves and people that are gay

1217.039 --> 1223.46
like actual homosexual gross

1220.7 --> 1225.82
and in a [ __ ] way of talking and all

1223.46 --> 1230.8600000000001
that right there's a big difference

1225.82 --> 1230.86
there's trans people that aren't facts

1231.559 --> 1233.98
really

1236.24 --> 1242.0
and I actually like those people they're

1239.72 --> 1244.82
often loners and I kind of resonate with

1242.0 --> 1247.1
that aspect The Loner aspect and

1244.82 --> 1249.62
there are ways I've had weird

1247.1 --> 1251.0
personality issues

1249.62 --> 1254.299
so I

1251.0 --> 1258.08
I can actually somewhat understand how

1254.299 --> 1261.44
they could have gone to go through that

1258.08 --> 1265.76
chose to do that I can imagine it it's

1261.44 --> 1269.679
just something I absolutely never

1265.76 --> 1269.679
ever we do

1271.94 --> 1276.74
I think she just yeah of course she just

1274.34 --> 1279.32
wants attention but apparently she

1276.74 --> 1281.9
doesn't want positive attention

1279.32 --> 1284.0
I offered it to her but no she insists

1281.9 --> 1286.4
no she has to talk about Flat Earth with

1284.0 --> 1288.98
me well that means it's going to be a

1286.4 --> 1291.8600000000001
[ __ ] show because it always is every

1288.98 --> 1293.6
single time she's brought it up ever

1291.86 --> 1295.76
and I'm not gonna do that

1293.6 --> 1297.9399999999998
not gonna waste my time and energy on

1295.76 --> 1297.94
that

1298.22 --> 1301.78
that's not what I had in mind

1305.36 --> 1312.1589999999999
she just wants to bicker and barf over

1308.24 --> 1312.159
people but with their negativity

1312.58 --> 1317.36
[Music]

1315.14 --> 1320.179
right

1317.36 --> 1323.4189999999999
maybe I Inspire that when I go rage win

1320.179 --> 1325.4
by accident in these people

1323.419 --> 1327.0800000000002
I Inspire them to throw loose because

1325.4 --> 1330.14
that's what's happening in such a moment

1327.08 --> 1333.039
I mean it's like ah suddenly all fence

1330.14 --> 1334.94
just breaks and boom

1333.039 --> 1338.6589999999999
No Limit

1334.94 --> 1341.72
and that must be very attractive to

1338.659 --> 1344.3000000000002
people that also struggle a lot with

1341.72 --> 1347.179
pressures all the time

1344.3 --> 1350.0
[Music]

1347.179 --> 1352.5800000000002
it's like seducing to them

1350.0 --> 1354.98
and so they will certainly Scurry it's

1352.58 --> 1358.6999999999998
happened like when I had that show after

1354.98 --> 1360.38
that I got email from three people

1358.7 --> 1362.6100000000001
about

1360.38 --> 1364.94
like oh

1362.61 --> 1367.1589999999999
[Music]

1364.94 --> 1370.159
like this you like oh maybe this maybe

1367.159 --> 1372.0
that and could maybe could you come here

1370.159 --> 1373.2800000000002
or on this show

1372.0 --> 1376.68
[Music]

1373.28 --> 1382.8799999999999
can I get on your show

1376.68 --> 1382.88
[Music]

1383.48 --> 1387.799
all right because I don't know when I

1385.82 --> 1391.58
get like that it certainly does like

1387.799 --> 1394.24
trigger things out there

1391.58 --> 1396.98
but yeah I don't like doing it because

1394.24 --> 1399.7
when I'm in that it's really miserable

1396.98 --> 1399.7
it's like

1399.799 --> 1406.039
barely catching up to staying stable

1403.22 --> 1407.96
feeling wise because the rage is

1406.039 --> 1410.539
literally like a lightning rod effect

1407.96 --> 1413.72
I'm literally like bang there's so much

1410.539 --> 1416.059
tension it's just like like not mine

1413.72 --> 1418.64
anymore I'm just throwing it out on

1416.059 --> 1420.08
other people accusing probably making

1418.64 --> 1423.0200000000002
some people

1420.08 --> 1425.24
feel really guilty

1423.02 --> 1428.0
or miserable

1425.24 --> 1430.88
and I'm sorry

1428.0 --> 1432.62
it's just that when you're in that it's

1430.88 --> 1435.3200000000002
just

1432.62 --> 1438.32
every everybody's like an enemy all of

1435.32 --> 1440.6
us but not really an end it's like

1438.32 --> 1443.059
it's so hard to describe it seems like

1440.6 --> 1445.4599999999998
everybody's enemy but it isn't it's not

1443.059 --> 1447.86
paranoia

1445.46 --> 1451.22
but paranoia

1447.86 --> 1454.1
format does kind of sign of seep through

1451.22 --> 1457.72
it but it's not like I am paranoid in

1454.1 --> 1457.7199999999998
such a moment I'm just

1458.84 --> 1461.799
rage win

1464.12 --> 1473.9189999999999
hello Amanda young good to you

1466.56 --> 1477.1399999999999
[Music]

1473.919 --> 1479.88
Monday 949 doesn't what doesn't matter

1477.14 --> 1482.939
what are you talking about

1479.88 --> 1482.939
[Music]

1487.24 --> 1493.34
right so anyway I like to set up these

1491.179 --> 1495.799
things that it's always a win-loo

1493.34 --> 1497.6
situation no matter what it's a win-lose

1495.799 --> 1500.059
situation whether it happens a win-lose

1497.6 --> 1502.1589999999999
situation when it doesn't happen

1500.059 --> 1503.96
yeah that sounds weird yeah it's not a

1502.159 --> 1505.5800000000002
win-win situation well you could call it

1503.96 --> 1507.679
a win-win situation because there's

1505.58 --> 1509.72
always some win

1507.679 --> 1512.98
right but there's always some loss too

1509.72 --> 1516.98
like the win would be okay

1512.98 --> 1518.96
if I had if it had happened then I'd had

1516.98 --> 1521.299
a really interesting moment and show

1518.96 --> 1523.58
that I'm actually quite dynamic in a way

1521.299 --> 1528.559
by doing that

1523.58 --> 1531.26
downside would be well Brenda I mean a

1528.559 --> 1533.299
lot of people hate Brenda and they might

1531.26 --> 1534.98
think that like why is he doing this now

1533.299 --> 1537.799
it's weird

1534.98 --> 1540.02
doing acting weird Armenian again like

1537.799 --> 1543.02
oh you love trolls or you're defending

1540.02 --> 1545.299
the Dwellers right they might go like

1543.02 --> 1547.52
that that's the downside now if it

1545.299 --> 1549.26
hasn't happened and it isn't happening

1547.52 --> 1551.539
then there's a

1549.26 --> 1554.6589999999999
positive side like yeah I don't have to

1551.539 --> 1556.4
associate with Brenda

1554.659 --> 1558.44
I don't have to connect up with her

1556.4 --> 1561.2
because she has a lot of really [ __ ]

1558.44 --> 1564.2
up things inside of her

1561.2 --> 1566.1200000000001
tension demons and

1564.2 --> 1568.1000000000001
yeah I don't want that to rub off on me

1566.12 --> 1569.2399999999998
so that's the win the downside is that

1568.1 --> 1571.3999999999999
well

1569.24 --> 1573.559
I was actually kind of looking forward

1571.4 --> 1575.419
to doing that weird little

1573.559 --> 1578.6589999999999
unique talk

1575.419 --> 1581.659
without the anger and now that's not

1578.659 --> 1584.1200000000001
gonna happen see so it's a win-lose

1581.659 --> 1587.2600000000002
situation

1584.12 --> 1587.26
no matter what happens

1589.059 --> 1594.039
Brenda doesn't yeah no [ __ ] Brenda

1591.62 --> 1594.039
doesn't matter

1594.07 --> 1598.22
[Music]

1595.58 --> 1602.36
but I mean Brenda has been

1598.22 --> 1605.059
around uh me and flatters the bait for

1602.36 --> 1607.84
quite some time she's involved even in

1605.059 --> 1611.6
some of the comedic history

1607.84 --> 1614.08
of crazy things fathers have said

1611.6 --> 1614.08
yeah

1614.179 --> 1619.64
so she matters a little

1618.02 --> 1621.8799999999999
right

1619.64 --> 1624.8600000000001
I mean it wouldn't have been a bad

1621.88 --> 1626.779
maneuver to have to have that show but

1624.86 --> 1628.82
oh no she insists on talking about

1626.779 --> 1630.98
flutter so that means she's gonna whine

1628.82 --> 1633.4399999999998
about Nathan Oakley

1630.98 --> 1635.799
gonna whine about how my life is so

1633.44 --> 1639.98
terrible because I'm a flat earther

1635.799 --> 1640.82

1646.34 --> 1652.6999999999998
you become a she

1649.22 --> 1654.08
when did you know how long did you want

1652.7 --> 1657.799
it

1654.08 --> 1661.1
how was your how's your social life like

1657.799 --> 1663.26
told you to do that like you didn't fit

1661.1 --> 1667.6
in as a man I just wanted to ask her

1663.26 --> 1667.6
right I just wanted to know like honest

1667.82 --> 1674.4189999999999
and I would have caught a whole range of

1671.179 --> 1676.1000000000001
attention even of people outside there

1674.419 --> 1678.98
because there's people that are just

1676.1 --> 1681.98
really interested in that

1678.98 --> 1684.74
they're interested in the non-historical

1681.98 --> 1686.98
trans people it's like why are they like

1684.74 --> 1686.98
that

1687.799 --> 1692.86
they want to get a little inside look

1689.419 --> 1692.8600000000001
because they're curious

1694.34 --> 1698.9599999999998
right it could have been a cool show but

1696.919 --> 1701.5

ugh

1726.98 --> 1732.799
I mean there are a few things in this

1729.5 --> 1736.34
world I find less interesting

1732.799 --> 1738.62
than things relating to Jesse Smollett

1736.34 --> 1741.6399999999999
serious

1738.62 --> 1745.539
that was like one of the lamest media

shitty events ever

look everything about it is sucks and is

1752.9 --> 1757.279
gay and ugh

I don't want to talk about if you don't

1757.279 --> 1761.299
mind London looks

1759.14 --> 1765.5
but I guess that is

1761.299 --> 1769.34
still trying to exploit his own [ __ ]

1769.34 --> 1776.26

documentary about how it was faked

1796.159 --> 1801.7990000000002

got like ew

kind of didn't read the rest I think

1809.94 --> 1819.8600000000001
[Music]

1816.86 --> 1821.779
right but I mean yeah it was a hoax I

1819.86 --> 1824.8
mean that was so blatantly obvious from

1821.779 --> 1828.08
the start it's just nauseating

1824.8 --> 1830.539
[Music]

1828.08 --> 1832.82
I'm surprised that there wasn't a

1830.539 --> 1834.799
documentary already but I guess this is

1832.82 --> 1836.899
the difference that now people involved

1834.799 --> 1839.24
are are gonna take part in that

1836.899 --> 1840.3899999999999

I can somewhat understand German

like

1952.279 --> 1956.83
reading it and listening both but

1961.94 --> 1968.6000000000001

German

1969.31 --> 1972.369

1972.399 --> 1977.899
like I'd have to be exposed to Germans

1975.559 --> 1980.24
talking German a lot and like be like

1977.899 --> 1983.26
yeah I'm gonna be talking German then I

1980.24 --> 1986.26
could probably learn German

thank you

1988.7 --> 1992.419

1990.679 --> 1995.539
I'm just not in that's it I could have

1992.419 --> 1998.1200000000001
been in that situation with my ex

1995.539 --> 2000.36
because she was actually really good at

1998.12 --> 2000.36
German

2000.58 --> 2005.799
she was like half children like her

2003.279 --> 2008.019
mother was actually a German immigrant

2005.799 --> 2010.6589999999999
that came to the Netherlands

2008.019 --> 2012.7
and the dad was English I'm saying too

2010.659 --> 2016.3600000000001
much anyway who cares

2012.7 --> 2018.6000000000001
but I could have talked German but I'm

2016.36 --> 2018.6
not

[Music]

2030.519 --> 2035.2
I mean I find like well-pronounced

German is very interesting to me the

2055.179 --> 2057.899

no no I don't really talk about that on

2061.72 --> 2068.2599999999998
this show land Lance

2064.119 --> 2070.179
I'm not talking about that

2068.26 --> 2072.159
in general

2070.179 --> 2074.859
it's the internet is completely

2072.159 --> 2076.96
satiating with that [ __ ]

2074.859 --> 2079.839
it's like

2076.96 --> 2081.52
and it'll just get me banned if I start

2079.839 --> 2085.419
talking about it

2081.52 --> 2088.179
or get me in this favor and what the

2085.419 --> 2090.58
hell am I supposed to say about it I

2088.179 --> 2091.8
mean I have a very clear standpoint on

2090.58 --> 2094.72
it and that's

2091.8 --> 2095.989
viruses literally don't exist they're

2094.72 --> 2098.68
conceptual

2095.989 --> 2102.64
[Music]

2098.68 --> 2106.54
so what more needs to be said I mean

2102.64 --> 2108.58
it's like yeah oh but outer space and no

2106.54 --> 2110.32
but it could be this and yeah but there

2108.58 --> 2113.2599999999998
can't be vacuum

2110.32 --> 2115.54
next to gas pressure without a container

2113.26 --> 2119.6800000000003
so it can't exist

2115.54 --> 2122.4
and that's how I feel this entire [ __ ]

2119.68 --> 2126.4199999999996
medical [ __ ]

2122.4 --> 2126.42
viruses don't exist

2131.76 --> 2136.5400000000004
it's literally made up there's no

2134.92 --> 2139.3
examples

2136.54 --> 2142.079
okay I I mean I really want to see that

2139.3 --> 2144.7000000000003
proof okay and I know like how would

2142.079 --> 2146.5
derived and concluded within the system

2144.7 --> 2148.4199999999996
that you have something that is

2146.5 --> 2151.119
associated with a virus perhaps right

2148.42 --> 2153.579
you might catch something

2151.119 --> 2155.32
particular conditions and then it's an

2153.579 --> 2158.98
Associated thing and they just say oh

2155.32 --> 2162.06
that's a virus but there is no virus

2158.98 --> 2162.06
those things don't exist

2163.0 --> 2166.38
it's not what's going on

2168.099 --> 2174.599
right parasites exist bacteria exist

2171.64 --> 2177.16
they just don't really work the way

2174.599 --> 2179.1400000000003
that's taught

2177.16 --> 2180.46
in a medical system

2179.14 --> 2182.56
right

2180.46 --> 2184.66
and there's like basic things like okay

2182.56 --> 2187.2599999999998
yeah bacteria when are they potentially

2184.66 --> 2189.7599999999998
risky when you have an open wound

2187.26 --> 2192.8190000000004
that's it

2189.76 --> 2192.8190000000004
[Music]

2193.0 --> 2197.04
for a rest bacteria are awesome

2197.26 --> 2202.599
right that's it

2199.72 --> 2204.7
that is it that's

2202.599 --> 2206.6800000000003
how far it goes

2204.7 --> 2209.5
you have parasites you have bacteria

2206.68 --> 2211.74
they could be a risk like with wounds

2209.5 --> 2214.72
that's it

2211.74 --> 2216.8799999999997
and the rest is all like yeah be careful

2214.72 --> 2220.72
what you eat be careful

2216.88 --> 2223.26
not to like get mice or rat feces

2220.72 --> 2223.2599999999998
around

2223.66 --> 2229.42
so you don't breathe it don't eat the

2225.76 --> 2232.5400000000004
dust Etc or literally get it caught up

2229.42 --> 2233.85
in food right because that's how you get

2232.54 --> 2235.3
diseases

[Music]

2235.3 --> 2238.5
among other things

2238.78 --> 2244.2400000000002

2241.839 --> 2249.16
like oh this happened and that happened

2244.24 --> 2251.6
in the like ah it's all a ruse it has to

2249.16 --> 2253.5989999999997
be viruses don't exist

2251.6 --> 2257.0699999999997

it's a perpetuated myth

[Music]

2259.78 --> 2263.5
when it comes to bacteria they're not

2261.46 --> 2266.38
the cause of disease correct but they

2263.5 --> 2268.66
can be disruptive though

2266.38 --> 2271.359
I mean if you have a wound open wound

2268.66 --> 2275.7999999999997
and bacteria and [ __ ] dirt all that

2271.359 --> 2278.619
comes in there that will disrupt with a

2275.8 --> 2281.6800000000003
delicate process of rebuilding or like

2278.619 --> 2283.7200000000003
trying to fix things in the moment it

2281.68 --> 2286.839
and then you can get an infection it's

2283.72 --> 2289.24
like the wrong stuff at the wrong place

2286.839 --> 2291.16
right when it comes to your skin and

2289.24 --> 2293.9199999999996
even your lungs and everything it's like

2291.16 --> 2298.52
that's just nonsense

there's bacteria all over the place

2312.54 --> 2318.52
it's not a problem that's natural

2315.599 --> 2321.6600000000003
they're a part of us

2318.52 --> 2325.32
I sometimes see like oh yeah

2321.66 --> 2326.98
animals or plants are like

2325.32 --> 2328.96
buildings

2326.98 --> 2333.06
they're like living quarters and

2328.96 --> 2333.06
buildings to the bacteria

2333.76 --> 2338.38
that are everywhere it's like they are

2336.16 --> 2341.2599999999998
actually like our citizens

2338.38 --> 2342.31
sometimes I see it like that

2341.26 --> 2343.7200000000003
roughly

2342.31 --> 2347.4
[Music]

2343.72 --> 2347.3999999999996
they're not hostile

2349.54 --> 2353.8
I mean some bacteria get hostile to

2352.18 --> 2356.98
other bacteria

2353.8 --> 2361.1400000000003
right some bacteria yeah they excrete

2356.98 --> 2361.14
toxins that aren't good for hosts

2362.04 --> 2366.359
but they will be taken care of

2367.48 --> 2371.7400000000002

2369.46 --> 2374.079
circumstance so it's like nothing about

2371.74 --> 2377.2
the entire thing

2374.079 --> 2380.5
is worth talking about about the details

2377.2 --> 2384.18
like although they're the new variant or

2380.5 --> 2387.82
oh then it's like bro

2384.18 --> 2391.1189999999997
it doesn't exist

2387.82 --> 2395.38
can I be more clear about it

2391.119 --> 2399.6400000000003
like nothing about it exists it's not a

2395.38 --> 2402.28
twisted representation it's a complete

2399.64 --> 2404.7999999999997
fabrication

2402.28 --> 2407.94
everything about it

2404.8 --> 2410.5600000000004
it's like a gigantic out of control

2407.94 --> 2413.14
role-playing game and people that

2410.56 --> 2415.48
participate in it can actually die

2413.14 --> 2418.359
because of

2415.48 --> 2421.92

they're behaving it's not even about

2452.619 --> 2456.94
the subject anymore they are just liars

2511.96 --> 2514.2
time

2516.22 --> 2522.7
it's just taking very long that's the

2518.74 --> 2526.4799999999996
problem right this to get them fully

2522.7 --> 2530.14
disabled and under control and in jail

2526.48 --> 2532.119
takes a long time while they are in

2530.14 --> 2533.92
power and that's kind of the Dilemma

2532.119 --> 2537.52
problem here

2533.92 --> 2539.92
it's like yeah but what if it takes too

2537.52 --> 2542.38
long and by the time you got everything

2539.92 --> 2544.88
right there where you need they've

2542.38 --> 2546.28
literally like destroyed everything else

2544.88 --> 2549.6400000000003
[Music]

2546.28 --> 2552.099
it's like the law is too slow for this

2549.64 --> 2555.24
effectively

2552.099 --> 2555.2400000000002
it's too slow

2558.82 --> 2566.1400000000003
they are openly destroying things and

2562.119 --> 2570.52
like gloating about it bragging they're

2566.14 --> 2573.22
[ __ ] insane and if we have to wait 20

2570.52 --> 2576.22
years to be able to do something about

2573.22 --> 2579.64
it they're literally going to destroy

2576.22 --> 2582.64
everything as you're slowly trying to

2579.64 --> 2584.74
catch up to get them for that original

2582.64 --> 2588.46
crime and oh look there's another 20

2584.74 --> 2593.04
crimes well you're gonna take another

2588.46 --> 2593.04
200 years to work on those

2593.14 --> 2600.0
right oh guess what's gonna happen 200

2595.72 --> 2602.68
years yeah it's going to be another 500.

2600.0 --> 2606.76
and then they're dead and then they've

2602.68 --> 2609.7
never been in jail once because the law

2606.76 --> 2611.1400000000003
was too busy working at getting to that

2609.7 --> 2612.52
point while they were destroying

2611.14 --> 2615.06
everything and then getting themselves

2612.52 --> 2615.06
killed

2615.94 --> 2620.319
okay may sound a little cynical when I

2618.52 --> 2622.599
say it like that

2620.319 --> 2624.46
it's just that I don't understand why

2622.599 --> 2627.1200000000003
this is taking so long I mean it

2624.46 --> 2628.92
shouldn't be necessary to take this long

2627.12 --> 2633.16
[Music]

2628.92 --> 2636.46
to get obvious Marxist info traders that

2633.16 --> 2638.85
are openly committing treason and like

2636.46 --> 2641.859
bragging about it almost

2638.85 --> 2643.5899999999997
[Music]

2641.859 --> 2644.74
to get them out I mean

2643.59 --> 2646.42
[Music]

2644.74 --> 2649.18
yeah but there's there's a bigger

2646.42 --> 2652.3
problem because it's also normally you

2649.18 --> 2653.3799999999997
see in a government set up like ours and

2652.3 --> 2656.98
England

2653.38 --> 2660.099
it's the nobility that takes care

2656.98 --> 2662.5
or that has like a bit still a bit of

2660.099 --> 2666.2200000000003
power against like the government if

2662.5 --> 2668.56
they go astray but now the nobility is

2666.22 --> 2669.8799999999997
part of it in both England and the

2668.56 --> 2673.48
Netherlands

2669.88 --> 2676.3
they're part of this problem you see and

2673.48 --> 2677.98
that's why it's just gonna take forever

2676.3 --> 2680.88
and

2677.98 --> 2683.38
all this

2680.88 --> 2686.2000000000003
legal has trying to do or something

2683.38 --> 2687.819
about what's happening might simply not

2686.2 --> 2691.2999999999997
work

2687.819 --> 2693.46
it might all come too late this is my

2691.3 --> 2696.04
worry

2693.46 --> 2698.44
I mean it's no more time for a

2696.04 --> 2703.68
discussion it's time to

2698.44 --> 2703.68
just do it just get them

2705.28 --> 2711.4
and get everybody else that's

2709.18 --> 2712.7799999999997
protecting them

2711.4 --> 2716.04
like

2712.78 --> 2716.0400000000004
all in the same go

2716.74 --> 2721.9599999999996
everything that's keeping them in place

2719.02 --> 2724.06
should be targeted yeah that's the sort

2721.96 --> 2726.76
of [ __ ] that they like to do to their

2724.06 --> 2731.44
opposition yeah we know yeah yeah

2726.76 --> 2734.1400000000003
yeah but I mean there's no more time

2731.44 --> 2734.98
for like trying to be virtuous in that

2734.14 --> 2737.5
sense

2734.98 --> 2739.66
this thing is

2737.5 --> 2745.14
very dangerous and it's gonna kill

2739.66 --> 2745.14
everything if it's not rapidly removed

2745.42 --> 2750.2200000000003
talking about these current

2748.06 --> 2752.7999999999997
government people

2750.22 --> 2754.72
that are literally attacking

2752.8 --> 2757.78

2757.78 --> 2761.51

it's no time for debates

2773.579 --> 2782.7400000000002
deliberations it's time to get them out

2779.14 --> 2784.0
and know who's going to be there to try

2782.74 --> 2785.87
to stop that

2784.0 --> 2787.72
and anticipate them

2785.87 --> 2791.6189999999997
[Music]

2787.72 --> 2793.2999999999997
know the opponent and make the moves

2791.619 --> 2796.5
get together

2793.3 --> 2796.5
and roll it out

2796.78 --> 2801.2200000000003
I mean I don't have an organization

2799.0 --> 2802.3
around me or anything

2801.22 --> 2804.5789999999997
okay

2802.3 --> 2808.2400000000002
[Music]

2804.579 --> 2811.2400000000002
but I know that's how it has to be this

2808.24 --> 2813.52
you gotta you gotta do it

2811.24 --> 2816.1189999999997
you gotta realize what's gonna come

2813.52 --> 2816.119
against you

2816.46 --> 2821.819
and then

2818.4 --> 2821.819
outmatch that

2825.52 --> 2830.2
you cannot use this system the way it is

2829.18 --> 2833.56
now

2830.2 --> 2836.68
to stop itself

2833.56 --> 2839.38
because these people are seated in in

2836.68 --> 2843.04
places where they are

2839.38 --> 2846.94
in control of the cohesion of it all

2843.04 --> 2849.88
they can literally just [ __ ] around now

2846.94 --> 2852.4
and people will let that happen so they

2849.88 --> 2853.48
attain some sort of Auto autocratic

2852.4 --> 2855.76
position

2853.48 --> 2858.819
a virtual autocratic position that's

2855.76 --> 2861.28
kind of like not connecting up with the

2858.819 --> 2862.96
legal system on which it should be

2861.28 --> 2866.3190000000004
running

2862.96 --> 2868.839
it's just sliding past it you can't then

2866.319 --> 2871.359
use that freaking legal system really to

2868.839 --> 2874.599
make it stop because it's not connected

2871.359 --> 2877.48
anymore so there has to be another

2874.599 --> 2879.7000000000003
measure

2877.48 --> 2883.119
so basically

2879.7 --> 2888.64
grounded grounded keep it stuck again

2883.119 --> 2890.92
stop the autocracy stop the lawlessness

2888.64 --> 2894.22
[Music]

2890.92 --> 2896.56
it has to be halted not just prosecuted

2894.22 --> 2898.24
as it keeps happening and happening and

2896.56 --> 2900.09
happening more

2898.24 --> 2903.149
has to be stopped

2900.09 --> 2903.1490000000003
[Music]

2903.4 --> 2908.8
how is that going to be accomplished

2906.04 --> 2911.46
how are you effectively going to stop

these people

2911.8 --> 2914.8590000000004
[Music]

2921.04 --> 2926.619
how does this even work does anybody

2923.619 --> 2929.079
still know how this even works

2926.619 --> 2932.1400000000003
how this will actually work

2929.079 --> 2934.8
or is everybody just just trying

2932.14 --> 2934.7999999999997
something

2934.9 --> 2939.1600000000003
is that is that where it going where

2937.06 --> 2941.2599999999998
this is going

2939.16 --> 2942.7
does anybody have a good view that's

2941.26 --> 2946.2400000000002
like

2942.7 --> 2949.54
in politics in the oppositional parties

2946.24 --> 2952.839
against this cartel

2949.54 --> 2955.119
they really have like a

2952.839 --> 2957.96
a realistic

2955.119 --> 2957.96
end result

2958.72 --> 2962.9399999999996
that is part of the plan of what they're

2960.7 --> 2962.9399999999996
doing

2965.44 --> 2971.339
oh they should they should have that I I

2968.02 --> 2971.339
don't know what it is though

2987.88 --> 2996.139
hmm

2990.48 --> 2996.139
[Music]

2996.599 --> 3000.26
yeah yeah anyway

3006.42 --> 3012.14
I have no idea who those people are

3009.18 --> 3012.14
where's the Curve

3012.75 --> 3015.9
[Music]

3018.14 --> 3023.7
oh okay is that yeah well maybe

3021.54 --> 3025.5
I mean you'll figure it out maybe you're

3023.7 --> 3027.72
just too fit yeah

3025.5 --> 3029.94
or maybe at some point you're like

3027.72 --> 3032.819
really into something and then suddenly

3029.94 --> 3034.38
you get a heart attack

3032.819 --> 3036.18
right

3034.38 --> 3038.28
never really know

3036.18 --> 3041.64
so hey you did it

3038.28 --> 3043.44
it's your issue now it's not my problem

3041.64 --> 3046.859
you believe that you're completely

3043.44 --> 3051.7400000000002
untouched or good on you I mean I don't

3046.859 --> 3051.74
want anybody to die from that [ __ ]

3053.76 --> 3055.92
but

3054.82 --> 3058.6800000000003
[Music]

3055.92 --> 3061.86
the problem is is that a lot of the

3058.68 --> 3064.5
effects don't kill you right away

3061.86 --> 3066.119
[Music]

3064.5 --> 3069.96
right there's

3066.119 --> 3071.4
like insta kill versions that will just

3069.96 --> 3073.8
[ __ ] somebody up and they'll just go

3071.4 --> 3077.48
convulse and die

3073.8 --> 3078.54
but there's also slower things in it

3077.48 --> 3082.5
[Music]

3078.54 --> 3085.619
so it's like five years that's what was

3082.5 --> 3088.44
told to me or not personally Face to

3085.619 --> 3091.8
Face by many different people

3088.44 --> 3094.44
researchers in the medical field

3091.8 --> 3096.7200000000003
that have learned about these medical

3094.44 --> 3099.3
procedures

3096.72 --> 3100.6189999999997
and what that would do in their

3099.3 --> 3103.5
estimation

3100.619 --> 3106.46
etc etc and they all roughly said like

3103.5 --> 3106.46
yeah five years

3106.5 --> 3113.16
it's like within five years like if like

3109.859 --> 3116.94
after five years you haven't taken any

3113.16 --> 3120.42
other medical experiments and suddenly

3116.94 --> 3123.059
you're like well yeah I know I just feel

3120.42 --> 3125.64
absolutely fine well then you're one of

3123.059 --> 3129.5
the really lucky ones except happy

3125.64 --> 3129.5
you might just be really lucky

3132.66 --> 3137.18
because most people

3135.059 --> 3140.76
that would have actually taken medical

3137.18 --> 3145.3999999999996
experimentations most of them will

3140.76 --> 3145.4
actually get something eventually

3147.86 --> 3151.92
[Music]

3149.599 --> 3153.3500000000004
especially if they had

3151.92 --> 3156.48
two

3153.35 --> 3158.96
[Music]

3156.48 --> 3158.96
anyway

3160.26 --> 3166.0400000000004
not even but you don't know zap zappy

3163.319 --> 3166.04
you don't know

3166.559 --> 3174.0
it wanes yeah but that's the pro that's

3171.42 --> 3180.1800000000003
the Preparatory

3174.0 --> 3182.28
yeah I mean mRNA modification yeah that

3180.18 --> 3186.359
doesn't wane

3182.28 --> 3190.2200000000003
yeah it literally permanently Alters

3186.359 --> 3194.02
parts of your flesh to start producing

3190.22 --> 3199.4089999999997
that altered stuff okay

3194.02 --> 3199.409
[Music]

3200.46 --> 3205.46
so if you have that doesn't wane

3205.619 --> 3211.44
yeah those things those medical

3209.18 --> 3215.359
experimentations yeah

3211.44 --> 3219.3
those weren't vaccinations technically

3215.359 --> 3220.94
it wasn't that it's an mRNA Terra

3219.3 --> 3223.559
therapy

3220.94 --> 3227.61
officially that's what it is so you're

3223.559 --> 3229.619
comparing it to something that it's not

3227.61 --> 3232.8
[Music]

3229.619 --> 3234.359
yeah this is not a old-fashioned vaccine

3232.8 --> 3237.1800000000003
idea

3234.359 --> 3240.18
of oh you just took some

3237.18 --> 3240.18
of the thing

3241.16 --> 3246.72
bacteria virus whatever they theorize

3244.26 --> 3249.5400000000004
right is supposed to be causing this

3246.72 --> 3251.16
stuff and then add some poison to the

3249.54 --> 3253.02
person for it and then your body takes

3251.16 --> 3258.2
care of it and then you become immune

3253.02 --> 3258.2
that the idea right the idea of that

3258.3 --> 3263.099
that's called vaccination yeah guess

3260.579 --> 3265.38
what this new medical experimentation

3263.099 --> 3269.819
since 2020

3265.38 --> 3272.099
it's not that that isn't what it is yeah

3269.819 --> 3274.5
it's not a vaccine

3272.099 --> 3276.54
I mean I'm not the first person to say

3274.5 --> 3277.8
that there was people yelling it all

3276.54 --> 3279.9
over the place

3277.8 --> 3283.319
during those years

3279.9 --> 3285.42
because it isn't it's not vaccine

3283.319 --> 3287.46
technology whether you believe that

3285.42 --> 3288.599
works or not is not the case it's not

3287.46 --> 3292.44
doesn't matter

3288.599 --> 3295.2000000000003
it isn't that officially it's not that

3292.44 --> 3296.2200000000003
so you're comparing it to something it's

3295.2 --> 3298.3999999999996
not

3296.22 --> 3298.3999999999996
foreign

3302.119 --> 3311.1600000000003
how freaking dumb are you that's what

3306.059 --> 3314.1600000000003
they say to make you get more it's not

3311.16 --> 3316.0789999999997
vaccination dummy

3314.16 --> 3319.5589999999997
it isn't

3316.079 --> 3320.819
and even if it was it wouldn't make any

3319.559 --> 3322.8590000000004
sense

3320.819 --> 3325.079
keep taking it

3322.859 --> 3329.16
because it wins then why would you keep

3325.079 --> 3331.28
taking this invasive procedure

3329.16 --> 3334.74
with poison in it

3331.28 --> 3337.2000000000003
unnatural things right even if it was a

3334.74 --> 3339.4799999999996
vaccine why would you keep taking it but

3337.2 --> 3343.16
it isn't

3339.48 --> 3345.059
it's Emma RNA therapy

that sounds like it's just

3838.2 --> 3843.24
mistaken

3840.559 --> 3845.88
relays it's like you're getting the

3843.24 --> 3850.5589999999997
wrong impulses from the wrong nerves

3845.88 --> 3852.48
like sensory rotation so like you would

3850.559 --> 3854.6400000000003
have with smell

3852.48 --> 3856.38
like sometimes you might get a cold and

3854.64 --> 3858.18
then suddenly everything just tastes

3856.38 --> 3859.38
different and smells different really

3858.18 --> 3861.66
weird

3859.38 --> 3864.7200000000003
like that but I guess more dramatic

3861.66 --> 3868.2
where actually they flip out with other

3864.72 --> 3871.68
type of senses that sounds really

3868.2 --> 3873.72
really freaking creepy

[Music]

3873.72 --> 3879.5099999999998
or maybe it's just really weird I don't

3876.78 --> 3882.5690000000004
know so never heard of that

3879.51 --> 3882.5690000000004

3884.4 --> 3889.38
he didn't observe it no real photo

3887.28 --> 3891.2400000000002

3889.38 --> 3896.639
what are you talking about

3891.24 --> 3896.6389999999997
[Music]

3899.83 --> 3903.5989999999997
[Music]

3901.68 --> 3906.839
I'm

3903.599 --> 3911.0
decently sure I've actually seen DNA

3906.839 --> 3911.0
under a microscope live

3912.3 --> 3916.139
[Music]

3918.55 --> 3926.7200000000003
[Music]

3923.88 --> 3931.02
so I'm not sure about that I'm I'm

3926.72 --> 3934.0789999999997
decently sure that DNA does exist now

3931.02 --> 3938.119
whether it it has the function that has

3934.079 --> 3941.6400000000003
been attributed to it in full

3938.119 --> 3943.26
by the medical establishment that's

3941.64 --> 3946.5589999999997
another matter

3943.26 --> 3948.25
but I'm decently sure that DNA does

3946.559 --> 3951.8390000000004
actually exist

3948.25 --> 3954.559
[Music]

3951.839 --> 3954.5589999999997
so

3954.9 --> 3960.2400000000002
and I mean genetic modification is

3958.319 --> 3962.39
really a thing

3960.24 --> 3963.4799999999996
is

3962.39 --> 3966.7799999999997
[Music]

3963.48 --> 3969.48
with like palpable things that happen

3966.78 --> 3970.2000000000003
because of it so it's kind of tough to

3969.48 --> 3972.059
ignore that

3970.2 --> 3975.0789999999997
[Music]

3972.059 --> 3975.079
where's the Curve

3975.599 --> 3981.54
yeah so DNA in my view is definitely

3979.02 --> 3983.88
there it just whether everything that's

3981.54 --> 3986.64
attributed to it

3983.88 --> 3989.1600000000003
if it actually is that that's another

3986.64 --> 3991.2
matter right just like bacteria not

3989.16 --> 3993.66
saying bacteria don't exist they don't

3991.2 --> 3995.9399999999996
exist no no they do exist they're just

3993.66 --> 3997.98
not what is said they are they don't

3995.94 --> 4000.14
work that way

3997.98 --> 4001.4
it's very pragmatic ways to figure that

4000.14 --> 4002.48
out

4001.4 --> 4004.52
right

4002.48 --> 4007.039
viruses don't exist they're completely

4004.52 --> 4008.599
made up and there's no proof of their

4007.039 --> 4011.119
existence

4008.599 --> 4013.4
literally there's no proof of their

4011.119 --> 4017.44
existence

4013.4 --> 4020.299
there's proof that there is other micro

4017.44 --> 4024.2000000000003
particulates that your body actually

4020.299 --> 4026.359
makes in certain circumstances

4024.2 --> 4029.0
when you do get sick

4026.359 --> 4031.5789999999997
then well these things that are

4029.0 --> 4033.859
associated with viruses do actually come

4031.579 --> 4037.48
out in the body and they do things

4033.859 --> 4037.48
yeah it's part of the body

4037.7 --> 4041.299
I think they're called exosomes there

4039.44 --> 4042.92
might even be other varieties of that

4041.299 --> 4047.48
right and that's what they supposedly

4042.92 --> 4050.48
test with with the tests yeah

4047.48 --> 4054.38
it doesn't prove anything it doesn't

4050.48 --> 4056.839
prove that those things are a virus that

4054.38 --> 4061.52
you're infected with it's it's barely

4056.839 --> 4064.64
registering a standard bodily function

4061.52 --> 4067.0389999999998
of your condition it's a side effect of

4064.64 --> 4070.2799999999997
that condition your body just makes that

4067.039 --> 4071.11
it's part of the fixing it procedure you

4070.28 --> 4073.7000000000003
see

4071.11 --> 4075.81
[Music]

4073.7 --> 4080.7799999999997
it's not a virus

4075.81 --> 4082.819
[Music]

4080.78 --> 4085.8190000000004
not even close

4082.819 --> 4089.5389999999998
like nothing close to that

4085.819 --> 4091.16
while bacteria well the idea about them

4089.539 --> 4095.119
is

4091.16 --> 4096.08
less illusionary it's just misunderstood

4095.119 --> 4099.08
and

4096.08 --> 4100.94
it's like known like oh bacteria can be

4099.08 --> 4102.5599999999995
really hostile in natural environments

4100.94 --> 4104.96
and then if you let it loose on flesh

4102.56 --> 4108.259
it'll suddenly start eating its way and

4104.96 --> 4112.279
become extremely hostile until it stops

4108.259 --> 4113.9
until the procreations of it will lead

4112.279 --> 4115.219
to bacteria that are less hostile

4113.9 --> 4118.719
because now the environment is less

4115.219 --> 4118.719
hostile than it changes so

4119.59 --> 4123.9800000000005
[Music]

4120.679 --> 4125.04
yeah there is a thingy little thingy

4123.98 --> 4126.3189999999995
it's called bacteria

4125.04 --> 4127.819
[Music]

4126.319 --> 4130.580000000001
but

4127.819 --> 4133.52
the fiction that surrounds them around

4130.58 --> 4136.66
them being diseases oh don't touch that

4133.52 --> 4136.660000000001
you'll get something

4137.179 --> 4142.219
oh really you'll get something or is

4139.819 --> 4144.259
your immune system just incredibly

4142.219 --> 4147.319
freaking weak

4144.259 --> 4149.359
because she put poison in yourself you

4147.319 --> 4152.299
don't eat healthy and you over wash

4149.359 --> 4155.54
because you're scared of fictional

4152.299 --> 4156.739
things to get you bacteria virus you're

4155.54 --> 4159.259
scared

4156.739 --> 4161.66
stress yeah stress helps also against

4159.259 --> 4163.94
your immune like your entire bodily

4161.66 --> 4166.339
cohesion yeah yeah oh oh now you're

4163.94 --> 4169.04
touching something I'm getting something

4166.339 --> 4171.5599999999995
oh I got something oh yeah it's because

4169.04 --> 4174.739
you're weak because you [ __ ] your own

4171.56 --> 4176.299
body up okay and then oh yeah you're

4174.739 --> 4180.0199999999995
touching it yeah yeah and now you get

4176.299 --> 4181.88
diseased you know what I don't use soap

4180.02 --> 4184.580000000001
when I do the dishes

4181.88 --> 4186.1990000000005
I do use sub for my feet though

4184.58 --> 4188.299
it's like the only thing I really use

4186.199 --> 4191.239
soap for and well for washing my hair

4188.299 --> 4193.46
but I don't do that like every day

4191.239 --> 4194.66
like brush my hair like once a week at

4193.46 --> 4196.28
best

4194.66 --> 4198.139999999999
it's much better

4196.28 --> 4202.759999999999
that way

4198.14 --> 4205.219
right that way yeah I I don't have to

4202.76 --> 4206.360000000001
fear I literally physically Don't Have

4205.219 --> 4209.12
To Fear

4206.36 --> 4211.699
right mentally I don't fear

4209.12 --> 4214.58
like oh I could get a disease I'm gonna

4211.699 --> 4216.5599999999995
touch this thing I mean the only thing

4214.58 --> 4220.04
that it might be slightly frightened of

4216.56 --> 4222.02
touching would be like a a dead carcass

4220.04 --> 4222.98
that's lying out there like a dead bird

4222.02 --> 4224.42
or something

4222.98 --> 4226.94
because

4224.42 --> 4228.38
if there's even like a little scratchy

4226.94 --> 4230.48
on my finger

4228.38 --> 4233.2390000000005
and I do get exposed to that that's

4230.48 --> 4235.5199999999995
incredibly dangerous it's well known the

4233.239 --> 4238.099999999999
toxins that are associated with that are

4235.52 --> 4241.64
incredibly dangerous if that's because

4238.1 --> 4243.1990000000005
it's a rotting carcass

4241.64 --> 4245.84
dangerous

4243.199 --> 4247.5199999999995
that's different though from all the

4245.84 --> 4249.8
other bacteria

4247.52 --> 4252.7390000000005
that are around

4249.8 --> 4255.4400000000005
they're doing something there

4252.739 --> 4258.199
and it's yeah

4255.44 --> 4260.659
That's not healthy to be around of

4258.199 --> 4264.0199999999995
course Etc right

4260.659 --> 4267.44
but I don't fear like oh this person has

4264.02 --> 4270.080000000001
a cold I'm like I don't give a [ __ ] I'll

4267.44 --> 4272.839999999999
kiss you on the cheek or whatever I

4270.08 --> 4276.08
don't care I'm not afraid

4272.84 --> 4278.6
because I don't over wash I eat decently

4276.08 --> 4283.12
healthy I take

4278.6 --> 4283.120000000001
careful measure at least of my stress

4283.28 --> 4287.84
and

4284.54 --> 4291.219
yeah so I'm just not afraid of it I know

4287.84 --> 4291.219
what my body can handle it

4292.699 --> 4297.62
anyway right but if you're like anxious

4296.179 --> 4300.38
and

4297.62 --> 4301.64
afraid of bacteria and viruses you over

4300.38 --> 4303.76
wash

4301.64 --> 4307.820000000001
and you stress out

4303.76 --> 4310.219
and you eat terrible things that are

4307.82 --> 4312.199
like oh this is sterile oh that means

4310.219 --> 4316.219
it's safe from like no that means the

4312.199 --> 4318.678999999999
opposite Yeah the more sterile food is

4316.219 --> 4320.84
the word the weaker your body gets the

4318.679 --> 4322.46
more vulnerable you get the more

4320.84 --> 4323.900000000001
destabilized it's not even like

4322.46 --> 4327.08
vulnerable because there's not things

4323.9 --> 4329.179
out there that are waiting to attack you

4327.08 --> 4330.98
okay the bacteria are not waiting to

4329.179 --> 4333.1990000000005
attack you like that they're just

4330.98 --> 4334.82
hanging around if you're suddenly weak

4333.199 --> 4339.04
then it's like

4334.82 --> 4339.04
A store owner that just like

4339.26 --> 4345.320000000001
drops his business and just like goes

4343.1 --> 4347.2390000000005
away never comes back and then it's like

4345.32 --> 4349.58
oh yeah now there's just this store with

4347.239 --> 4352.82
all this stuff nobody's claiming it oh

4349.58 --> 4355.219
okay we're just gonna get that then like

4352.82 --> 4358.159
that's how bacteria would respond it's

4355.219 --> 4360.86
like oh oh you're not you're just

4358.159 --> 4363.0199999999995
leaving everything open okay we're just

4360.86 --> 4366.739
trying it out we're just trying to get

4363.02 --> 4371.0
in right and then you get diseased

4366.739 --> 4373.28
because your body is not able to handle

4371.0 --> 4374.54
these things that are just normal to

4373.28 --> 4377.9
have around

4374.54 --> 4380.36
right that's the problem not that you

4377.9 --> 4382.04
but there's this dangerous thing out

4380.36 --> 4384.739
there that could touch you and then oh

4382.04 --> 4387.96
no it's your body is [ __ ]

4384.739 --> 4389.9
that is the only real problem

4387.96 --> 4392.06
[Music]

4389.9 --> 4394.12
right when you're unstable

4392.06 --> 4397.1
health-wise

4394.12 --> 4401.26
metabolically then you just cannot

4397.1 --> 4401.26
handle things that are normal

4401.42 --> 4406.9400000000005
and then you get diseased

4405.02 --> 4409.46
it's because of your condition not

4406.94 --> 4413.259999999999
because of those dangerous things out

4409.46 --> 4413.26
there because that's [ __ ]

4414.8 --> 4418.6990000000005
anyway

4417.199 --> 4421.219
about cold

4418.699 --> 4422.719
all right yeah yeah

4421.219 --> 4425.9
make sure to take care of that lemon

4422.719 --> 4428.9800000000005
juice and all that's great honey

4425.9 --> 4428.98
lemon juice honey

4430.46 --> 4433.659
plenty of vitamin C

4433.699 --> 4438.32
and hey getting a cold every now and

4435.62 --> 4441.34
then is actually good for you cleans you

4438.32 --> 4441.34
up cleans you out

4442.699 --> 4447.08
what's wrong with this astronomy it's

4444.679 --> 4448.82
naming stars and making up [ __ ]

4447.08 --> 4450.5599999999995
about it based on heliocentric

4448.82 --> 4453.259999999999
presupposition

4450.56 --> 4455.92
synthetic Cynthia that's the wrong with

4453.26 --> 4455.92
astronomy

4459.1 --> 4463.219
[Music]

4460.64 --> 4465.92
it's all made up [ __ ]

4463.219 --> 4468.62
it's just looking at the sky

4465.92 --> 4471.38
or telescope or whatever and just

4468.62 --> 4474.32
looking up really close or whatever they

4471.38 --> 4478.219
do it's just looking at the sky and then

4474.32 --> 4481.599999999999
making assumptions about what that is

4478.219 --> 4481.6
nothing is proven

4499.699 --> 4504.199
no that's not how that works at all

4502.219 --> 4506.42
Zapped heavy

4504.199 --> 4509.0599999999995
and you're chronically sick your immune

4506.42 --> 4510.92
system is not in overdrive

4509.06 --> 4513.52
you're chronically sick then you're

4510.92 --> 4513.52
unstable

4514.1 --> 4521.2390000000005
then your immune system can't handle it

4519.199 --> 4524.44
it

4521.239 --> 4524.44
can't fix it

4525.199 --> 4529.639999999999
so you basically have an open wound that

4528.08 --> 4533.14
won't heal

4529.64 --> 4533.14
that's chronic

4534.5 --> 4539.14
right your healing capability can fix it

4539.3 --> 4545.360000000001
okay Doctor yeah they whatever man you

4542.84 --> 4547.82
seem to know very little about medical

4545.36 --> 4549.5599999999995
things at all that but you didn't even

4547.82 --> 4551.659
know

4549.56 --> 4554.9800000000005
what you've been taking is in the

4551.659 --> 4554.98
vaccine officially

4555.14 --> 4561.860000000001
not by the definition of what that not

4557.96 --> 4564.26
by the procedure technology assumed to

4561.86 --> 4566.719
work of vaccination

4564.26 --> 4569.0
you didn't know that after all this time

4566.719 --> 4571.64
after it's been snowing information

4569.0 --> 4572.02
about that on a daily basis for years

4686.96 --> 4693.4
they should apologize for

even if they don't change their minds

4693.92 --> 4698.12
right

4695.78 --> 4700.639999999999

atrociously

4702.92 --> 4707.7390000000005
towards people that are just immediately

4705.62 --> 4711.38
on the Flat Earth train okay

4707.739 --> 4713.9

4711.38 --> 4715.400000000001
globers treat flat earthers and of

4713.9 --> 4717.44
course globers

4715.4 --> 4720.0199999999995
the anti-flat Earth especially like

really lie and double speak and that's

4720.02 --> 4725.179
really uh aggravating and draining I get

4723.8 --> 4727.9400000000005
that

4753.38 --> 4759.08
you can literally

4755.36 --> 4760.759999999999
just patronize and treat people that

4759.08 --> 4763.82
don't understand that

4760.76 --> 4766.58

4763.82 --> 4768.98
like they're slaves or something who the

4766.58 --> 4770.84
[ __ ] you think you are just because you

4768.98 --> 4774.32

4774.32 --> 4779.42
your scum if you do that

4777.5 --> 4781.46

5233.219 --> 5238.92
I haven't been in the gym Panda Discord

5240.28 --> 5246.46
like I've

5242.26 --> 5249.46
maybe like one time in like 2016 or

5246.46 --> 5250.83
something I got in there for like

5249.46 --> 5253.06
a few minutes

5250.83 --> 5255.94
[Music]

5253.06 --> 5258.639
and then I was like okay this is

5255.94 --> 5260.919999999999
weird yeah I think I did actually get

5258.639 --> 5262.719
Once in there but that's like a long ass

5260.92 --> 5264.28
time ago never went back there because

5262.719 --> 5268.42
it's just like

5264.28 --> 5272.86
this place is so toxic and that was like

5268.42 --> 5275.92
six years ago okay six seven years ago

5272.86 --> 5279.099999999999
I don't even want to know what it's like

5275.92 --> 5281.679
right now because it's gonna be worse I

5279.1 --> 5283.84
know it is I've heard by the way it's

5281.679 --> 5286.12
worse from people that have checked it

5283.84 --> 5288.639
out recently so

5286.12 --> 5290.32
talking six yeah right yeah okay yeah

5288.639 --> 5291.159000000001
then I've been in there once I mean but

5290.32 --> 5293.199
that's

5291.159 --> 5296.379999999999
dude

5293.199 --> 5299.699
that's eight years nine years ago

5296.38 --> 5299.6990000000005
wait eight years ago

5301.6 --> 5306.42
no seven seven years ago right

5307.719 --> 5313.3
so yeah I've been there one time but

5310.54 --> 5316.0
after that time all those years ago

5313.3 --> 5318.4800000000005
before the flat air debates even existed

5316.0 --> 5318.48
okay

5318.699 --> 5324.099999999999
it was just free roaming flat earther

5320.679 --> 5326.86
doing my thing checking things out

5324.1 --> 5328.719
and I was invited there and then it it

5326.86 --> 5330.639
was really [ __ ] lame and immediately

5328.719 --> 5332.38
felt like they're just trying to mind

5330.639 --> 5337.78
control everybody

5332.38 --> 5340.3
gem is such a manipulative sick [ __ ] he

5337.78 --> 5343.0
is so manipulative it is so it's surreal

5340.3 --> 5345.34
it's really surreal and it was even back

5343.0 --> 5348.639
then it was that manipulative right now

5345.34 --> 5350.92
it's all pure demonic Spirit I'm not

5348.639 --> 5353.08
going there ever

5350.92 --> 5356.56
ever again

5353.08 --> 5359.38
I went there that one time

5356.56 --> 5362.679
and I was uh that was plenty

5359.38 --> 5364.659000000001
that was already pretty bad back then

5362.679 --> 5365.92
seven years ago

5364.659 --> 5368.5
right

5365.92 --> 5370.9800000000005
anyway I'm rounding out the show Pete

5368.5 --> 5370.98
and Pete

5371.35 --> 5376.120000000001
[Music]

5372.82 --> 5378.04
highly tough dude I don't even want to

5376.12 --> 5380.139
I don't even want to know how toxic it

5378.04 --> 5382.239
is right now turret

5380.139 --> 5385.42
it's probably one of the most toxic

5382.239 --> 5388.659
places on the internet

5385.42 --> 5391.12
okay that's saying something it's

5388.659 --> 5393.36
probably one of the most toxic places on

5391.12 --> 5393.36
the internet

5393.52 --> 5401.38
although there's some really way out of

5396.82 --> 5403.96
control psychotic evil demonic [ __ ] also

5401.38 --> 5407.26
that's just pure it but I mean that's

5403.96 --> 5409.659
not really open internet now is it

5407.26 --> 5411.9400000000005
so yeah it's one of the most [ __ ] up

5409.659 --> 5414.159
places on the internet Japanese Discord

5411.94 --> 5416.879999999999
I don't go there I don't plan to ever go

5414.159 --> 5416.879999999999
there ever again

5420.239 --> 5428.94
so hey but hopefully my show isn't that

5423.88 --> 5428.9400000000005
toxic unless when I just go berserk

5429.46 --> 5434.5
well maybe even when I go berserk it's

5432.46 --> 5436.179
less toxic than just listening to gem

5434.5 --> 5438.88
panda

5436.179 --> 5440.7390000000005
yeah I think I can actually state that

5438.88 --> 5443.679
in full confidence
