i held up uh

75.6 --> 78.39999999999999
it's monday

80.88 --> 87.03999999999999
and yeah it's

84.88 --> 88.08
it's not super rainy it hasn't really

87.04 --> 91.92
rained

88.08 --> 95.03999999999999
today but it's still yeah very cloudy

91.92 --> 98.32000000000001
very big thick clouds too

95.04 --> 101.04
and i don't know it's it's still

98.32 --> 102.15899999999999
kind of warm but with the wind it's it's

101.04 --> 105.84
also kind of fresh

102.159 --> 109.2
so like when i had a smoke outside

105.84 --> 111.119
then i would put a sweater on like that

109.2 --> 114.64
but it's also because of my back because

111.119 --> 119.119
i don't want to risk

114.64 --> 122.799
uh yeah straining it with the cold

119.119 --> 124.799
but yeah in here it's it's still

122.799 --> 126.799
it's more like spring temperature i

124.799 --> 129.84
don't know how warm it is let me let me

126.799 --> 129.84
check that for a second

134.64 --> 140.07999999999998
all right it's 90 degrees now apparently

138.0 --> 143.599
so yeah it is a lot fresher but it's

140.08 --> 146.08
still a decent temperature

143.599 --> 146.79999999999998
it looks like coming period it's it's

146.08 --> 149.84
going to be

146.8 --> 153.20000000000002
roughly the same type of weather

149.84 --> 155.36
22 degrees 20 18

153.2 --> 156.319
so yeah it seems like they're really the

155.36 --> 160.72000000000003
hot period

156.319 --> 160.72
now at least in the netherlands is over

162.4 --> 168.8
it was a pretty intense summer so

165.76 --> 172.959
yeah let's see who is in chat

168.8 --> 174.87900000000002
rope h was first over mukul

172.959 --> 178.0
good servant and thank you for the 99

174.879 --> 184.0
cent super chat donation

178.0 --> 186.319
uh i trust more will follow soon

184.0 --> 186.319
right

190.4 --> 194.8
so i got a green tea with me as usual

193.76 --> 198.0
and

194.8 --> 199.76000000000002
tamara coffee

198.0 --> 201.44
i really enjoyed my tamara coffee

199.76 --> 203.04
yesterday it was really

201.44 --> 205.92
good to have that boost again and my

203.04 --> 207.92
show was pretty good i thought

205.92 --> 210.0
so let's see if we can do that again

207.92 --> 213.83999999999997
although it is a monday show so it's not

210.0 --> 213.84
this long

216.72 --> 227.84
right see my notes

228.08 --> 233.28
yeah yeah i came up with the name after

231.2 --> 236.56
the show yesterday

233.28 --> 236.56
the apocalypse

236.72 --> 240.159
in reflection too much of what it talked

238.56 --> 242.159
about that

240.159 --> 244.879
i'm just starting to suspect more and

242.159 --> 244.879
more that just

247.68 --> 255.84
well yeah hold on it's

257.199 --> 263.91900000000004
uh yeah about the the elites

260.32 --> 267.199
basically using the bible as a blueprint

263.919 --> 268.08
to emulate end times and everything that

267.199 --> 269.759
comes with it

268.08 --> 272.479
and yeah you could call that the lar

269.759 --> 272.47900000000004
apocalypse

275.6 --> 280.6
and yeah everybody seems to be very

277.84 --> 281.67999999999995
willing to play along

280.6 --> 284.40000000000003
[Music]

281.68 --> 286.32
because yeah most people just can't

284.4 --> 289.919
really distinguish whether

286.32 --> 292.08
what is going on is really about

289.919 --> 293.68
what the bible says or whether it is an

292.08 --> 297.12
emulation it's

293.68 --> 301.039
most people just can't can't get their

297.12 --> 304.32
minds even to start wondering about that

301.039 --> 307.59999999999997
it's very tough you know ah

304.32 --> 307.59999999999997
right so hey adam meekin

307.759 --> 313.12
to have you in here as well uh

310.96 --> 317.039
right so yeah big bear was live again

313.12 --> 317.039
yesterday on benjamin was great

317.919 --> 322.56
more about the path of christ versus ira

320.639 --> 326.96000000000004
and he really put it down

322.56 --> 326.96
like i mentioned it on my show yesterday

327.28 --> 331.19899999999996
about ira and he basically echoed it

329.84 --> 334.32
like yes

331.199 --> 337.6
most of us have a a christ

334.32 --> 339.28
and an ira inside of us and it is a

337.6 --> 343.199
constant struggle that's like

339.28 --> 343.19899999999996
the struggle part of the path

343.48 --> 349.12
[Music]

346.56 --> 349.84
so yeah great show yesterday on owen

349.12 --> 353.84000000000003
benjamin was

349.84 --> 353.84
really a lot of fun

361.6 --> 367.84000000000003
wait a minute this can't be right

369.6 --> 372.72
it is monday right

373.199 --> 377.12
oh wait wait wait yeah yeah yeah yeah

375.36 --> 377.91900000000004
yeah after that i kind of watched the

377.12 --> 381.52
movie

377.919 --> 384.56
on netflix despite everything uh

381.52 --> 386.96
bean the ultimate disaster movie now i

384.56 --> 390.16
known rowan atkinson

386.96 --> 391.52
mr bean and i know that i i just my

390.16 --> 393.52000000000004
style is very

391.52 --> 395.28
is relatively innocent and i really like

393.52 --> 399.12
that about him

395.28 --> 401.44
and yeah i never seen that movie

399.12 --> 402.16
i don't remember having seen it maybe

401.44 --> 404.319
i've seen it

402.16 --> 406.56
once but it was like really freaking

404.319 --> 408.56
high or something

406.56 --> 410.96
because yeah when i saw it it's just

408.56 --> 414.24
like holy [ __ ]

410.96 --> 417.68
it was so freaking funny

414.24 --> 420.16
like yeah that really surprised me

417.68 --> 421.12
for the for the better it was hilarious

420.16 --> 423.52000000000004
i know mr b

421.12 --> 424.319
movies you know you got to like it or

423.52 --> 427.919
you don't

424.319 --> 429.759
i thought it was great and yeah it was

427.919 --> 432.4
like the whole setup

429.759 --> 434.84000000000003
for which mr bean is very suited was

432.4 --> 437.35999999999996
kind of like a

434.84 --> 440.15999999999997
cluezo type setup

437.36 --> 442.16
he is like that but he was like kind of

440.16 --> 443.52000000000004
like

442.16 --> 445.36
i don't know it wouldn't be too much of

443.52 --> 446.88
spoiler because this

445.36 --> 450.8
happens pretty much at the start but

446.88 --> 453.199
they're basically sending him as a dud

450.8 --> 455.039
like oh we have to some send somebody we

453.199 --> 456.72
don't really like to

455.039 --> 458.56
we want to get rid of this guy so we're

456.72 --> 460.08000000000004
going to send him and then just false

458.56 --> 463.199
recommendations and all that

460.08 --> 464.56
or something it was a weird premise but

463.199 --> 466.879
that way he arrived

464.56 --> 467.84
and everybody started to think like oh

466.879 --> 470.319
the emperor without

467.84 --> 471.599
any close situation like oh this guy's

470.319 --> 472.8
supposed to be a genius and he just

471.599 --> 476.87899999999996
turns out to be just an

472.8 --> 480.72
absolute well mr bean a complete idiot

476.879 --> 483.199
that just does everything so terrible

480.72 --> 484.16
but then they give a few twists in it

483.199 --> 486.56
like he does

484.16 --> 487.52000000000004
manage to like pretty miraculously and

486.56 --> 489.759
hilariously

487.52 --> 492.0
fix certain situations when everybody

489.759 --> 493.91900000000004
everything already seems completely full

492.0 --> 495.199
bar and that gives a nice twist to the

493.919 --> 497.84
movie

495.199 --> 500.56
even though in the end yeah if you pay

497.84 --> 503.75899999999996
attention it is kind of a dubious end

500.56 --> 504.319
not dark but dubious it's i thought it

503.759 --> 506.8
was a

504.319 --> 508.40000000000003
really funny movie i thought it was good

506.8 --> 510.96000000000004
so i recommend that one

508.4 --> 513.52
beating the ultimate disaster movie it

510.96 --> 513.52
was funny

519.039 --> 523.519
right i was yeah also watch another

522.399 --> 527.36
movie

523.519 --> 529.519
rush hour three and it was [ __ ]

527.36 --> 531.36
i didn't like that at all it's a long

529.519 --> 534.9590000000001
time ago since i last watched

531.36 --> 538.16
one of those types of movies and

534.959 --> 540.959
[ __ ] man it's so bad like

538.16 --> 541.8389999999999
the the contrast it's just with the b

540.959 --> 546.16
movie is just

541.839 --> 547.2
absurd so stupid stereotype bad example

546.16 --> 550.0
annoying

547.2 --> 551.76
thoughtless it's like a mindless type of

550.0 --> 554.64
movie

551.76 --> 555.6
it's like such ridiculous [ __ ] and like

554.64 --> 558.3199999999999
cartoonish

555.6 --> 560.399
dangerous solutions that yeah if in the

558.32 --> 563.12
real world if anyone would ever try that

560.399 --> 563.839
they would die and the movie was full of

563.12 --> 566.9590000000001
that

563.839 --> 569.519
i didn't like it i just didn't like it

566.959 --> 569.5189999999999
as a movie

572.64 --> 576.3199999999999
now i'm actually gonna watch rush hour

575.839 --> 578.24
one

576.32 --> 579.9200000000001
hoping that it might be sort of the same

578.24 --> 582.8
formula a little bit better

579.92 --> 585.12
but i kind of expect the same i'm just

582.8 --> 587.76
checking it out to compare it

585.12 --> 588.72
oh and then at the same time it is kind

587.76 --> 592.56
of just a

588.72 --> 593.6
dumb action movie so what's the third

592.56 --> 595.279
anyway

593.6 --> 596.72
not really important don't recommend

595.279 --> 598.64
watching that

596.72 --> 601.2
right and this morning i had an

598.64 --> 604.24
unexpected early phone call from

601.2 --> 606.9590000000001
my friend in neymar an update basically

604.24 --> 606.9590000000001
situation

607.36 --> 612.88
she's doing pretty good so a lot of the

610.72 --> 613.76
social chaos surrounding her actually

612.88 --> 617.2
seems to have

613.76 --> 621.2
just subtly stabilized like certainly

617.2 --> 623.279
dad of her kid is behaving

621.2 --> 624.9590000000001
when normally he is just completely out

623.279 --> 627.2
of his mind so he seems to have

624.959 --> 629.5999999999999
entered like a stable phase and yeah

627.2 --> 631.279
that's better than just the nonsense

629.6 --> 635.279
before that so

631.279 --> 639.4399999999999
yeah glad to hear that from my friend

635.279 --> 643.2
uh also we talked a lot about the whole

639.44 --> 644.6400000000001
kuronu situation and how much of it is

643.2 --> 647.6800000000001
fake and

644.64 --> 650.56
like she has her own development in

647.68 --> 652.8
alternative healing and she is very

650.56 --> 657.1199999999999
interested in learning about

652.8 --> 659.12
how natural perfumes and etheric oils

657.12 --> 660.64
and she's like literally becoming like a

659.12 --> 664.079
hobby perfumist

660.64 --> 665.4399999999999
at it but none all natural and yeah

664.079 --> 667.4399999999999
there's some knowledge

665.44 --> 669.36
expert knowledge about that too and it

667.44 --> 672.24
is being scrubbed from the internet she

669.36 --> 674.5600000000001
noticed she said like yeah we have

672.24 --> 676.32
there's this teaching you get to learn

674.56 --> 677.04
about that through the people face to

676.32 --> 679.519
face because

677.04 --> 681.519
on the internet if somebody puts out

679.519 --> 682.5600000000001
just the knowledge about that for people

681.519 --> 686.5600000000001
just to

682.56 --> 690.4799999999999
read about it it gets deleted

686.56 --> 691.1999999999999
like this is this is false medical

690.48 --> 693.279
information

691.2 --> 695.6
even though those things actually do

693.279 --> 696.0
work it's very simple tricks it's kind

695.6 --> 699.6
of like

696.0 --> 702.8
herbs you know herbal healing except

699.6 --> 705.0400000000001
focused purely on the on the etheric

702.8 --> 709.68
oils and the smells and

705.04 --> 709.68
yeah she's doing that very interesting

712.8 --> 715.92
anyway yeah that that was pretty much it

715.12 --> 718.639
and then the show

715.92 --> 719.279
started i hung around a little at spurs

718.639 --> 722.0
chemos

719.279 --> 722.0
before that

723.68 --> 726.16
and uh

727.839 --> 731.839
yeah then i started the show

732.0 --> 735.92
so let's see who else came in here in

733.839 --> 739.519
the meantime

735.92 --> 743.04
matthew mitchell good servant

739.519 --> 745.839
tracy cole all right good sermon you're

743.04 --> 745.8389999999999
already here

747.36 --> 752.0790000000001
ah so yeah my back is also doing a lot

750.0 --> 754.959
better

752.079 --> 755.519
it's no longer stiff it's just a little

754.959 --> 758.88
sore

755.519 --> 761.92
and i'm noticing yeah

758.88 --> 765.519
the junk is being like the

761.92 --> 767.68
reparation junk the stuff that typically

765.519 --> 769.12
happens when you get something like that

767.68 --> 771.04
because it's basically your body

769.12 --> 773.6
repairing itself

771.04 --> 774.399
you know after the thing and then after

773.6 --> 776.48
that's over

774.399 --> 779.2
usually like all the well the

776.48 --> 782.72
construction works

779.2 --> 785.44
there biological in there it all gets

782.72 --> 786.0
dumped and you notice that i don't want

785.44 --> 789.6800000000001
to get into

786.0 --> 789.68
details you just notice it

791.279 --> 797.76
you can smell it in your your piss

794.72 --> 799.36
and your feces among other so i'm

797.76 --> 801.12
noticing like yeah it's cleaning

799.36 --> 803.2
it's cleaning up and that means that i'm

801.12 --> 804.079
probably gonna be completely restored

803.2 --> 806.88
back to normal

804.079 --> 808.079
tomorrow or the day after glad because

806.88 --> 810.959
yeah backache

808.079 --> 813.5999999999999
is really annoying to have it's really

810.959 --> 815.8389999999999
tiresome

813.6 --> 815.839
ah

818.399 --> 822.8
right also notice by the way looking

821.279 --> 827.8389999999999
again like how brown

822.8 --> 831.8389999999999
i've become i really put up a 10 in this

827.839 --> 833.839
see it's pretty strong right

831.839 --> 836.48
it's a pretty big difference if you look

833.839 --> 836.48
at it like that

837.44 --> 840.9590000000001
see yeah anyway

841.04 --> 843.8389999999999
i like it

855.04 --> 860.079
right so

861.12 --> 863.44
uh

866.16 --> 870.16
all right i guess i went through the

868.16 --> 873.36
intro phase of the show

870.16 --> 875.68
so it's back to open for questions

873.36 --> 875.6800000000001
time

880.24 --> 888.0
so yeah if anybody has a

885.279 --> 889.519
want me to tackle oh yeah by the way

888.0 --> 892.88
thank you good servant for a couple of

889.519 --> 892.88
funny videos you shared

894.24 --> 898.8
found in an alex jones clip from some

897.04 --> 901.4399999999999
while ago that somebody else not

898.8 --> 902.56
mountain bear anything made a cartoon

901.44 --> 905.519
over it

902.56 --> 907.4399999999999
it was really funny like alex jones

905.519 --> 907.76
going berserk and then the cartoon of

907.44 --> 910.839
him

907.76 --> 912.72
like overemphasized it i thought it was

910.839 --> 914.32
hilarious

912.72 --> 927.839
i think alex jones probably thinks it's

914.32 --> 927.839
hilarious too

928.399 --> 935.199
let me share the link why not

931.44 --> 935.1990000000001
it's a short silly video

936.639 --> 940.88
who is mountain bear a mountain bear is

939.199 --> 944.079
one of the owen benjamin

940.88 --> 948.079
follow owen benjamin followers that

944.079 --> 951.4399999999999
makes a lot of cartoons and then uses

948.079 --> 953.519
uh yeah owen benjamin's voice like his

951.44 --> 955.36
when he does his characters

953.519 --> 957.04
in a certain scenario that he tries to

955.36 --> 959.12
depict

957.04 --> 960.639
and he does that on camera just live and

959.12 --> 962.5600000000001
then mountain bear typically just

960.639 --> 965.759
extracts the audio from that

962.56 --> 969.5999999999999
and makes his own drawn cartoons

965.759 --> 972.16
his own cartoon figures

969.6 --> 974.48
red pill rooster is better you think i

972.16 --> 974.48
don't know

976.48 --> 982.32
red pill rooster is just different style

980.24 --> 984.639
i think mountain is just really freaking

982.32 --> 984.639
funny

984.88 --> 988.16
just really makes me rolling on the

986.72 --> 990.72
floor laughing sometimes

988.16 --> 993.04
especially with the the book of ira that

990.72 --> 996.2
i shared yesterday the link

993.04 --> 998.48
that was mountain bear too

996.2 --> 1001.519
[Music]

998.48 --> 1003.839
no no

1001.519 --> 1006.399
fractal escape that's a really stupid

1003.839 --> 1006.399
thing to say

1008.48 --> 1025.839
like owens hammer what

1029.52 --> 1033.199
i don't know owens hammer but mountain

1031.28 --> 1035.12
bear has been doing videos like this for

1033.199 --> 1038.559
some time now for at least a year

1035.12 --> 1038.9589999999998
so i know you check him out uh he is i

1038.559 --> 1041.199
think

1038.959 --> 1042.079
completely banned on youtube they keep

1041.199 --> 1045.28
on deleting

1042.079 --> 1047.12
his channel but yeah you can still find

1045.28 --> 1050.24
it on uh

1047.12 --> 1053.84
on bit shoot i think it was let me

1050.24 --> 1053.84
let me double check

1055.44 --> 1058.0
where was it

1060.799 --> 1066.0
yeah on bit shoot right so most of

1064.0 --> 1067.2
mountain bears work is on bit you'd if

1066.0 --> 1070.48
you

1067.2 --> 1070.48
let me just go there again

1072.08 --> 1078.6399999999999
because if you go watch the book of ira

1075.2 --> 1078.64
which is freaking funny

1078.84 --> 1084.08
then yeah you also get available

1082.32 --> 1085.84
lists of mountain mirrors all the work

1084.08 --> 1087.12
because i think it's all uploaded in

1085.84 --> 1095.84
there

1087.12 --> 1095.84
check it out

1101.12 --> 1108.32
he seems to jump on whatever or whoever

1104.88 --> 1112.7990000000002
owen deems appropriate

1108.32 --> 1112.799
but what do you mean matthew mitchell

1114.48 --> 1118.24
because i'm pretty sure mountain bear

1116.08 --> 1120.84
just picks out

1118.24 --> 1122.08
characters typically their own benjamin

1120.84 --> 1124.3999999999999
plays

1122.08 --> 1126.8799999999999
and then he just creates a visual

1124.4 --> 1127.8400000000001
character to try and represent it as

1126.88 --> 1130.0800000000002
funny and as

1127.84 --> 1137.6789999999999
best as he can and he does a pretty

1130.08 --> 1140.559
decent job

1137.679 --> 1142.24
so the freckled red haired grabbler guy

1140.559 --> 1145.2
was pretty much the character before

1142.24 --> 1151.84
ira and ira is like i don't know it's

1145.2 --> 1151.8400000000001
his dirty old uncle or something

1154.4 --> 1165.8400000000001
hey obermical

1171.62 --> 1174.7099999999998
[Music]

1175.039 --> 1178.48
you have a headache tiny womble all

1176.88 --> 1181.679
right

1178.48 --> 1184.559
is the the weather transition

1181.679 --> 1184.5590000000002
influencing you

1187.2 --> 1191.76
right but yeah you got a good point

1189.2 --> 1192.559
don't get too triggered by ballers

1191.76 --> 1195.28
because

1192.559 --> 1197.2
man there's just so many ballers out

1195.28 --> 1199.039
there the

1197.2 --> 1200.559
bottom line ballers that are really

1199.039 --> 1204.84
terrible and i'm glad

1200.559 --> 1207.84
that the people in my chat are not like

1204.84 --> 1207.84
that

1210.32 --> 1221.84
i didn't sleep too well last night

1213.679 --> 1221.8400000000001
all right

1235.679 --> 1238.799
was i in what

1239.12 --> 1249.84
what kind of a question is that adam

1253.52 --> 1257.28
oh wait you mean the chinese pool party

1256.799 --> 1263.2
right

1257.28 --> 1264.799
yeah yeah i hadn't seen that video

1263.2 --> 1268.559
before

1264.799 --> 1270.96
i i saw just this pictures

1268.559 --> 1272.72
that owen benjamin showed on the show

1270.96 --> 1275.1200000000001
just to show like yeah these people are

1272.72 --> 1279.44
not social distancing

1275.12 --> 1279.4399999999998
but you are like that

1280.0 --> 1282.32
right

1298.48 --> 1301.76
oh yeah by the way i don't know if

1300.159 --> 1305.2800000000002
anybody cares but

1301.76 --> 1305.919
alex jones seems to have this pool party

1305.28 --> 1309.2
thing go

1305.919 --> 1312.3200000000002
of well outside

1314.64 --> 1317.679
well

1315.76 --> 1319.52
it does did look like a lot of fun it's

1317.679 --> 1321.44
like yeah you just have an outside pool

1319.52 --> 1324.8799999999999
party with

1321.44 --> 1327.2
drumpers i guess and all that

1324.88 --> 1329.6000000000001
like yeah and there is going to be alex

1327.2 --> 1330.8400000000001
jones on the bullhorn yelling in between

1329.6 --> 1334.08
it all and saying

1330.84 --> 1336.08
how yeah you know what he says when he

1334.08 --> 1336.57
has a bullhorn

1336.08 --> 1339.1999999999998
so

1336.57 --> 1342.08
[Music]

1339.2 --> 1345.6000000000001
wuhan is not the only one it's not the

1342.08 --> 1347.84
only place where there's pool parties

1345.6 --> 1347.84
uh

1349.36 --> 1353.039
just as a contrast anyway

1354.24 --> 1357.84
oh fractal escapes gonna be really hot

1356.159 --> 1362.96
over there

1357.84 --> 1362.9599999999998
where is that where are you

1368.0 --> 1371.2
california or something

1372.84 --> 1375.84
texas

1400.84 --> 1403.84
uh

1414.84 --> 1417.84
uh

1425.679 --> 1429.679
do i get pregnant what amazon i don't

1428.4 --> 1433.3600000000001
know

1429.679 --> 1436.48
i well first off i don't have a tv

1433.36 --> 1438.6399999999999
now there is an an internet tv

1436.48 --> 1441.039
of the dutch channels pretty much on the

1438.64 --> 1444.159
end yeah you can find it on the internet

1441.039 --> 1447.6
yeah and i amazon prime i've never

1444.159 --> 1449.679
even tried that i don't it's like

1447.6 --> 1450.8799999999999
amazon netflix or something right just

1449.679 --> 1459.8400000000001
like the disney channel

1450.88 --> 1459.8400000000001
and all that

1466.96 --> 1471.44
the temperature is in toronto canada

1469.84 --> 1473.84
what

1471.44 --> 1473.8400000000001
really

1495.279 --> 1503.36
hmm this is very unusual for

1499.84 --> 1503.36
temperatures like that to be there

1505.44 --> 1508.72
it's so far north

1509.36 --> 1516.3999999999999
it's very unusual because like is

1512.64 --> 1521.44
i don't know what uh

1516.4 --> 1521.44
what latitude supposedly is toronto

1522.24 --> 1529.84
i don't know i could look it up

1551.279 --> 1557.52
oh what

1554.84 --> 1560.3999999999999
really

1557.52 --> 1562.559
oh i well i certainly underestimated

1560.4 --> 1562.96
that it seems to be at the same latitude

1562.559 --> 1567.279
as

1562.96 --> 1568.32
middle of france so i guess it more has

1567.279 --> 1570.72
to do with than

1568.32 --> 1573.279
the wind streams and the mountain ranges

1570.72 --> 1573.279
over there

1574.24 --> 1578.72
because it's the same latitude as france

1579.44 --> 1583.679
yeah just as norway supposedly should be

1581.919 --> 1587.039
the same latitude

1583.679 --> 1588.88
as iceland and greenland yeah at least

1587.039 --> 1592.72
on the ball

1588.88 --> 1595.0390000000002
on the ball map that google map seems to

1592.72 --> 1595.039
use

1596.84 --> 1601.52
huh should share that for a second

1605.2 --> 1616.799
hold on

1613.279 --> 1619.76
right so toronto

1616.799 --> 1619.76
somewhere over here

1619.919 --> 1626.64
i think was it

1622.96 --> 1630.48
yeah right it's over here so then i'm

1626.64 --> 1630.48
going to go straight sideways

1633.039 --> 1637.12
see he end up in france

1638.559 --> 1641.76
so yeah that wasn't exactly what i

1640.159 --> 1644.0800000000002
expected i thought it was more north but

1641.76 --> 1644.08
i guess

1644.72 --> 1649.44
the west canada is more

1649.76 --> 1655.76
down south then or the east part is more

1653.279 --> 1661.039
down south than the west part i guess

1655.76 --> 1661.039
if i would have to believe the ball yeah

1666.84 --> 1669.84
anyway

1680.84 --> 1683.84
oh

1692.72 --> 1697.679
yeah right yeah george sanford it's just

1697.039 --> 1700.24
that

1697.679 --> 1701.279
in my mind as when i picture it i just

1700.24 --> 1703.76
see

1701.279 --> 1705.36
very over simplistically like okay there

1703.76 --> 1708.0
is the us

1705.36 --> 1708.7199999999998
and then there's canada so it's north of

1708.0 --> 1712.08
that right

1708.72 --> 1715.2
but apparently it's more

1712.08 --> 1715.1999999999998
slanted i guess

1716.32 --> 1723.2
it's weird i can't really explain it

1720.32 --> 1725.52
just goes to show that it's weird how

1723.2 --> 1729.679
how all the layouts

1725.52 --> 1731.44
the maps really are how does this work

1729.679 --> 1732.88
how does this work with the celestials

1731.44 --> 1739.8400000000001
and all that yeah

1732.88 --> 1739.8400000000001
it's confusing to me

1743.36 --> 1749.36
now in general when you see a top

1746.48 --> 1749.3600000000001
a typical

1751.52 --> 1757.2
map centered around a country

1754.88 --> 1758.3200000000002
and then you look at canada it it

1757.2 --> 1767.8400000000001
doesn't really look

1758.32 --> 1767.84
like it's diagonal you know what i mean

1775.6 --> 1781.36
but yeah then again i guess that the

1778.64 --> 1782.24
the more east of canada there is like

1781.36 --> 1785.6
this part

1782.24 --> 1787.2
that does go down

1785.6 --> 1790.1589999999999
[Music]

1787.2 --> 1790.88
like there's this all these giant lakes

1790.159 --> 1794.0
over there

1790.88 --> 1796.5590000000002
and canada kind of sticks out more to

1794.0 --> 1800.0
the south and toronto is there

1796.559 --> 1802.48
kind of in between new york state and

1800.0 --> 1802.48
michigan

1804.72 --> 1812.48
so toronto really is on the southern tip

1808.399 --> 1812.4799999999998
of canada i guess

1813.76 --> 1816.08
right

1820.84 --> 1823.84
hmm

1848.559 --> 1851.84
all right

1853.44 --> 1858.88
yeah also just weird this is nothing to

1856.96 --> 1860.96
do with anything much but

1858.88 --> 1863.919
just like looking at the whole shape of

1860.96 --> 1865.919
the united states canada and mexico i

1863.919 --> 1869.76
don't know what in my mind it

1865.919 --> 1871.3600000000001
wasn't like the baya california sewer

1869.76 --> 1874.8799999999999
it seems to be a part of mexico i

1871.36 --> 1878.399
thought it was also part

1874.88 --> 1881.919
of california

1878.399 --> 1883.039
but it's not i don't know it's probably

1881.919 --> 1886.3200000000002
my mistake

1883.039 --> 1888.799
mistaken interpretation

1886.32 --> 1890.1589999999999
although yeah those regions even in

1888.799 --> 1893.84
mexican are

1890.159 --> 1893.8400000000001
basically called california so

1900.08 --> 1903.1299999999999
[Music]

1904.84 --> 1907.84
anyway

1914.559 --> 1921.84
yeah right george sanford exactly

1931.679 --> 1936.799
our most distant friends are upside down

1934.559 --> 1939.6
what

1936.799 --> 1941.84
no but that's not the maps don't say

1939.6 --> 1941.84
that

1942.08 --> 1946.72
you know maps are all just flat

1944.399 --> 1949.12
projections

1946.72 --> 1951.039
they're not the things that are lying

1949.12 --> 1953.12
it's the layout of it all

1951.039 --> 1955.279
and the relation to the heavenly bodies

1953.12 --> 1956.799
and the understanding thereof

1955.279 --> 1960.32
the complete understanding you know

1956.799 --> 1963.9189999999999
we're getting a a generic

1960.32 --> 1964.559
idea of how latitudes longitudes work

1963.919 --> 1966.5590000000002
and

1964.559 --> 1968.8799999999999
in relation to the sun position on

1966.559 --> 1970.8799999999999
average and all that

1968.88 --> 1973.519
but i don't know maybe there are things

1970.88 --> 1973.519
about it that

1975.36 --> 1981.519
they kind of don't make direct sense as

1978.48 --> 1982.88
that are not exactly as we should as we

1981.519 --> 1984.96
would expect

1982.88 --> 1986.0800000000002
it's like that anyway and they just

1984.96 --> 1989.3600000000001
glance over that

1986.08 --> 1992.08
i don't know there could be plenty of

1989.36 --> 1994.4799999999998
weird little oddities about the the very

1992.08 --> 1996.799
layout of our own realm

1994.48 --> 1997.679
that we simply have not fully understood

1996.799 --> 1999.6
yet

1997.679 --> 2001.919
although there even during the whole sun

1999.6 --> 2004.559
tracking situation a few years ago it

2001.919 --> 2007.039
became apparent that

2004.559 --> 2007.039
yeah that

2008.32 --> 2013.279
that the angles of where the sun rises

2011.679 --> 2016.64
and sets

2013.279 --> 2019.919
don't fully seem to match the

2016.64 --> 2022.24
map presumed orientation

2019.919 --> 2023.519
that kind of thing that was weird even

2022.24 --> 2025.279
back then

2023.519 --> 2026.96
but that for me was the first hint like

2025.279 --> 2028.48
there's something really wrong about the

2026.96 --> 2031.279
whole layout

2028.48 --> 2033.84
it's just there's something wrong it's

2031.279 --> 2033.84
incomplete

2034.24 --> 2039.44
yeah but if you want to start figuring

2037.76 --> 2040.64
it out down first we got to get the

2039.44 --> 2042.64
equator

2040.64 --> 2047.76
figured out we got to figure out what is

2042.64 --> 2051.599
the real equator

2047.76 --> 2061.839
and what is the geometry of this virtual

2051.599 --> 2061.839
line what is it

2067.949 --> 2072.32
[Music]

2069.76 --> 2073.599
yeah fractal escape i know yeah further

2072.32 --> 2077.9190000000003
north it is just all

2073.599 --> 2089.839
mountainous and snowy as [ __ ]

2077.919 --> 2089.839
with lots of pine forests

2100.839 --> 2103.839
um

2105.599 --> 2110.079
wait what joe mama you live on the ocean

2114.839 --> 2117.839
what

2118.32 --> 2131.839
what do you mean

2135.25 --> 2138.369
[Music]

2142.88 --> 2148.449
hmm

2145.26 --> 2148.449
[Music]

2155.839 --> 2159.839
all right good serving

2178.0 --> 2183.28
they all live on the border of us well

2181.2 --> 2184.8799999999997
i don't know i heard rumors you know but

2183.28 --> 2186.88
i'm in europe so

2184.88 --> 2188.0
i don't know how much there is to that

2186.88 --> 2192.1600000000003
but

2188.0 --> 2192.16
many americans just think that canada

2192.24 --> 2199.2799999999997
is like a a rebellious northern us

2196.079 --> 2204.6400000000003
province just refuses to

2199.28 --> 2204.6400000000003
work along or something i don't know

2204.8 --> 2207.6800000000003
probably not

2209.92 --> 2213.76
but yeah there's been a lot of joking

2211.68 --> 2214.48
around and remember south park the movie

2213.76 --> 2217.44
even

2214.48 --> 2218.8
with the war between canada and us and

2217.44 --> 2222.16
all that

2218.8 --> 2229.8390000000004
god that was ridiculous

2222.16 --> 2229.839
what funny

2242.56 --> 2248.0
uh yeah well george sanford it depends

2246.8 --> 2251.76
you know if you're gonna take

2248.0 --> 2255.2
regular turpentine for painting

2251.76 --> 2258.4
from the store yeah don't do that

2255.2 --> 2261.7599999999998
don't do that but

2258.4 --> 2263.92
yeah there is like medical grade

2261.76 --> 2265.6800000000003
i guess specifically designated and

2263.92 --> 2269.599
purified for medical

2265.68 --> 2273.9199999999996
purposes by alternative medical people

2269.599 --> 2276.079
and that does work so

2273.92 --> 2278.0
i don't even like that they just call it

2276.079 --> 2280.7200000000003
that because it's so easily

2278.0 --> 2281.599
mistakeable for just regular painters

2280.72 --> 2285.839
product

2281.599 --> 2285.839
you know

2294.079 --> 2299.04
i think a lot of people associate it

2297.28 --> 2300.7200000000003
like that and that is why it is being

2299.04 --> 2302.96
ridiculed because when you just say

2300.72 --> 2303.839
turpentine then i guess a lot of people

2302.96 --> 2306.079
will think

2303.839 --> 2307.7599999999998
what you're just gonna drink the paint

2306.079 --> 2310.8390000000004
thinner

2307.76 --> 2313.119
you know like that i wouldn't recommend

2310.839 --> 2314.96
it

2313.119 --> 2317.119
but that's not what that is it's a very

2314.96 --> 2320.4
specific chemical

2317.119 --> 2327.839
it's very refined not just

2320.4 --> 2327.839
like paint dissolver

2341.68 --> 2345.2799999999997
right fractal escape well the best way

2344.0 --> 2350.56
to do it would

2345.28 --> 2352.32
to distinguish it as medical turpentine

2350.56 --> 2355.839
and then explain exactly what the

2352.32 --> 2355.839
difference is

2371.119 --> 2376.1600000000003
okay tiny one more uh

2378.079 --> 2382.88
i don't think pepsi max is very good for

2380.4 --> 2385.76
you besides they use aborta's feet

2382.88 --> 2388.1600000000003
aborted fetus cells to uh as flavor

2385.76 --> 2392.4
enhancers so

2388.16 --> 2392.3999999999996
i don't know i'd rather have medical

2394.839 --> 2397.839
turpentine

2402.96 --> 2411.839
and i don't really like cola

2406.56 --> 2411.839
drinks anymore anyway

2413.76 --> 2418.1600000000003
turp made from pine needles i don't know

2416.88 --> 2421.839
fractal escape

2418.16 --> 2424.48
look i've never tried that

2421.839 --> 2425.599
i've never tried it myself i've heard

2424.48 --> 2428.96
about it

2425.599 --> 2432.4
never literally tried that i have tried

2428.96 --> 2436.4
a miracle mineral supplement

2432.4 --> 2436.4
which i think is kind of similar

2436.8 --> 2442.079
but never turpentine i've never tried

2439.76 --> 2442.079
that

2448.56 --> 2454.0789999999997
but it could be i don't know it could be

2450.24 --> 2454.0789999999997
made from pine sap

2456.18 --> 2459.23
[Music]

2464.839 --> 2467.839
hoodie

2478.839 --> 2481.839
so

2496.8 --> 2500.7200000000003
all right well tiny one will look you if

2498.88 --> 2502.8
you don't like it

2500.72 --> 2503.9199999999996
that's fine you don't have to try it

2502.8 --> 2506.4
just because it

2503.92 --> 2507.44
came up doesn't mean that it you're

2506.4 --> 2509.599
mandated to

2507.44 --> 2510.88
look into it or try it out yourself you

2509.599 --> 2513.92
know

2510.88 --> 2516.0
but yeah if you don't want it then

2513.92 --> 2517.839
there's no real use really trying to

2516.0 --> 2521.2
downplay it or say it's

2517.839 --> 2523.839
[ __ ] or compare it silly ways

2521.2 --> 2523.839
you know

2529.599 --> 2537.0800000000004
i kind of had that response at at first

2532.8 --> 2538.1600000000003
too you know then i thought like what

2537.08 --> 2542.319
[Music]

2538.16 --> 2546.3999999999996
yuck but it's

2542.319 --> 2546.4
hey if it's effective it's effective

2547.28 --> 2552.5600000000004
yeah tiny womble you keep

2550.64 --> 2555.52
and a lot of you you keep doing that

2552.56 --> 2559.7599999999998
making these jokes

2555.52 --> 2563.359
it's just reversing things around

2559.76 --> 2565.92
not making it apparent right

2563.359 --> 2567.92
how's that funny it's just confusing to

2565.92 --> 2570.44
me

2567.92 --> 2573.359
effective for what effective for

2570.44 --> 2577.119
detoxification

2573.359 --> 2580.96
does it again yeah it cleanses your guts

2577.119 --> 2580.96
from parasites

2582.96 --> 2588.56
so non-bacterial parasites

2586.96 --> 2591.119
that's what it does that's what it's

2588.56 --> 2591.119
said to do

2591.839 --> 2594.88
of course there's other things you can

2594.079 --> 2597.92
also take

2594.88 --> 2600.88
instead that sort of do the same thing

2597.92 --> 2602.88
but yeah the turpentine seems to be very

2600.88 --> 2607.839
simple it's very cheap

2602.88 --> 2607.839
and very effective

2610.48 --> 2617.52
i've never tried it but yeah um benjamin

2614.48 --> 2619.04
does it and hey he's looking pretty damn

2617.52 --> 2622.079
good so

2619.04 --> 2623.68
it seems to work out great for him

2622.079 --> 2625.28
you know if it wouldn't be working and

2623.68 --> 2628.96
you keep continuing it

2625.28 --> 2628.96
yeah it's gonna show

2629.119 --> 2635.839
oh benjamin just looks great he's

2632.88 --> 2635.839
glowing so

2637.359 --> 2642.0789999999997
of course also because he's a he's a new

2639.44 --> 2642.079
dad again

2642.24 --> 2649.839
but you know what i mean

2656.67 --> 2659.76
[Music]

2664.98 --> 2668.179
[Music]

2674.839 --> 2677.839
ugh

2680.96 --> 2684.48
oh see now you're doing it again

2689.68 --> 2694.0789999999997
why do you persist tiny wombo

2694.24 --> 2699.52
ah hey julio papan

2698.0 --> 2701.2
thank you for the five dollar super chat

2699.52 --> 2704.24
donet donation

2701.2 --> 2706.3999999999996
paypal is working you say let me check

2704.24 --> 2706.3999999999996
it

2711.76 --> 2716.7200000000003
i certainly hope it's working because

2713.92 --> 2716.7200000000003
i'm gonna need it

2717.119 --> 2719.839
oh

2720.48 --> 2726.88
okay yeah it is working

2723.76 --> 2730.079
thank you so much

2726.88 --> 2730.079
thank you very much

2730.56 --> 2735.52
yeah that's a great relief i really do

2733.119 --> 2735.52
need it

2735.68 --> 2743.2799999999997
and this will help get me through the uh

2740.24 --> 2743.2799999999997
yeah the next month

2744.24 --> 2749.52
and i'm still gonna be i have to be very

2746.48 --> 2752.72
uh careful with my spending

2749.52 --> 2755.28
despite any donations i get because yeah

2752.72 --> 2755.2799999999997
it just

2755.76 --> 2759.0400000000004
i don't know where it all went or maybe

2758.56 --> 2761.599
i do

2759.04 --> 2763.44
you know i got short pants i got sandals

2761.599 --> 2766.4
i got

2763.44 --> 2768.079
white shirts i did get all these little

2766.4 --> 2769.76
things that i just really

2768.079 --> 2772.6400000000003
really needed because everything was

2769.76 --> 2775.8390000000004
literally just disintegrating around me

2772.64 --> 2775.839
and my supplements

2777.04 --> 2782.72
but it's just yeah the money went

2778.88 --> 2782.7200000000003
through quicker than i expected

2782.96 --> 2786.8
although i'm now perfectly stocked up

2785.119 --> 2789.839
for the

2786.8 --> 2789.8390000000004
coming period i think

2791.839 --> 2795.359
so thank you again yeah thank you so

2793.52 --> 2795.92
much julio pepin for the continuing

2795.359 --> 2799.119
support

2795.92 --> 2801.04
you're you're keeping me going i do need

2799.119 --> 2804.079
it

2801.04 --> 2804.079
more is welcome

2805.92 --> 2808.7200000000003
thank you very much

2810.88 --> 2815.119
is holland an expensive place to live in

2813.04 --> 2818.4
general yes

2815.119 --> 2818.4
very very much

2819.119 --> 2822.88
but at the same time a lot of dutch

2822.0 --> 2825.92
people have

2822.88 --> 2828.0
kind of sort of thrived in it despite it

2825.92 --> 2830.0
being very expensive

2828.0 --> 2831.2
but i don't know it for some reason it's

2830.0 --> 2834.64
especially

2831.2 --> 2835.52
women and a lot of them have like this

2834.64 --> 2838.0
hobby thing

2835.52 --> 2839.359
where they're they're basically being

2838.0 --> 2842.4
like

2839.359 --> 2843.52
micro grabblers and just find freaking

2842.4 --> 2846.2400000000002
discounts with

2843.52 --> 2848.24
everything they always know you know

2846.24 --> 2850.5589999999997
i've had girlfriends too that just for

2848.24 --> 2851.839
some reason they always know how to get

2850.559 --> 2853.92
something

2851.839 --> 2856.0789999999997
that's even kind of expensive and they

2853.92 --> 2859.839
just happen to find it really cheap

2856.079 --> 2859.8390000000004
somewhere i don't know how they do it

2860.0 --> 2863.599
but yeah you really have to be almost

2862.16 --> 2866.0
partial grabbler

2863.599 --> 2866.6400000000003
just to be able to get around without

2866.0 --> 2869.2
just

2866.64 --> 2870.4
losing money all over the place because

2869.2 --> 2874.3999999999996
everything is

2870.4 --> 2874.4
by default pretty expensive here

2875.68 --> 2887.839
there's a lot of taxations on everything

2908.079 --> 2913.599
but yet to be fair it's also just

2910.48 --> 2916.8
because of my smoking

2913.599 --> 2919.76
because smoking cannabis is expensive in

2916.8 --> 2919.76
the netherlands too

2920.64 --> 2925.359
you know it is pretty much expensive

2923.2 --> 2927.839
almost everywhere

2925.359 --> 2931.04
but yeah unless you have your own plans

2927.839 --> 2933.52
that you take care of your own sources

2931.04 --> 2935.839
it's it's going to be expensive pretty

2933.52 --> 2937.52
much no matter what

2935.839 --> 2939.599
unless you're going to settle for really

2937.52 --> 2941.2
crappy quality you get from the streets

2939.599 --> 2944.2400000000002
or something

2941.2 --> 2948.0789999999997
because i think that it is around two

2944.24 --> 2948.0789999999997
not too much i don't even try it

2948.48 --> 2952.559
it's only when they on the sunday where

2950.8 --> 2953.8390000000004
they close down the coffee shops because

2952.559 --> 2956.8
of corona measures

2953.839 --> 2958.0789999999997
for one day that i got something from

2956.8 --> 2961.2000000000003
the streets and that was

2958.079 --> 2964.7200000000003
decent quality as well so but it is

2961.2 --> 2966.72
expensive and yes i am a daily smoker

2964.72 --> 2970.48
and when you do that

2966.72 --> 2973.2
uh just you slowly

2970.48 --> 2975.359
increase the amount you smoke over time

2973.2 --> 2976.72
and that does kind of become expensive

2975.359 --> 2980.0789999999997
and

2976.72 --> 2985.839
i do feel kind of stupid for it

2980.079 --> 2985.8390000000004
i wish it was less

2987.04 --> 2992.0
how much is seven grams of what

2990.16 --> 2994.319
well you're not even allowed to buy that

2992.0 --> 2994.319
much

2995.2 --> 2998.96
you're not allowed to have more than

2996.8 --> 3000.6400000000003
five grams of something on you at any

2998.96 --> 3004.0
time

3000.64 --> 3006.16
fractal escape seriously if you get

3004.0 --> 3008.24
caught

3006.16 --> 3010.64
or if a coffee shop gets caught selling

3008.24 --> 3013.9199999999996
more than 5 grams

3010.64 --> 3017.2799999999997
they can get closed down and you can

3013.92 --> 3021.52
yeah get arrested over that

3017.28 --> 3022.88
it's part of the uh the non-legalization

3021.52 --> 3027.839
rules

3022.88 --> 3027.839
the condoning rules system

3029.44 --> 3033.359
but i guess 5 grams on average would be

3032.4 --> 3036.079
somewhere between

3033.359 --> 3036.96
50 and 70 euros i guess something like

3036.079 --> 3038.48
that

3036.96 --> 3040.4
depending on what type it is what

3038.48 --> 3042.72
quality is

3040.4 --> 3044.0
qualities do differ even within coffee

3042.72 --> 3045.5989999999997
shops you know yeah they have the

3044.0 --> 3047.119
cheaper stuff and then they have like

3045.599 --> 3050.1600000000003
the really

3047.119 --> 3052.4
high grade stuff so

3050.16 --> 3054.72
but seven grams yeah no you can't buy

3052.4 --> 3069.839
seven grams anywhere except maybe off

3054.72 --> 3069.839
the streets or something

3090.16 --> 3097.1189999999997
well 700

3093.839 --> 3098.88
that's crazy but yeah i guess in canada

3097.119 --> 3100.6400000000003
it's different

3098.88 --> 3102.2400000000002
they have a completely different way of

3100.64 --> 3104.16
handling it it's much more like a

3102.24 --> 3111.68
legalization over there than it is

3104.16 --> 3113.359
even here i guess

3111.68 --> 3115.2799999999997
okay george sanford well yeah i guess

3113.359 --> 3118.64
that's the difference isn't it

3115.28 --> 3119.2000000000003
look the netherlands is a really weird

3118.64 --> 3123.1189999999997
country

3119.2 --> 3126.72
with its policies for cannabis because

3123.119 --> 3129.2000000000003
legally you can't grow it in grower

3126.72 --> 3132.3999999999996
quantities

3129.2 --> 3135.2799999999997
you can't yet that's the only real way

3132.4 --> 3138.319
you get some decent amount of product

3135.28 --> 3141.52
so it's still based on illegal

3138.319 --> 3143.68
growing scene yet the quality

3141.52 --> 3146.0
is still checked very carefully and all

3143.68 --> 3148.72
that despite that

3146.0 --> 3150.96
but yeah that all those things do make

3148.72 --> 3155.2799999999997
it expensive

3150.96 --> 3155.28
because it is practically still illegal

3155.44 --> 3160.96
it's very weird it it in my opinion

3158.8 --> 3162.96
it's a very outdated policy it's

3160.96 --> 3165.2
ridiculous that they still apply it like

3162.96 --> 3165.2
that

3165.359 --> 3168.88
they should just legalize it get it over

3167.599 --> 3171.28
with you know

3168.88 --> 3173.119
it'll probably create a lot of job

3171.28 --> 3176.3190000000004
opportunities as well

3173.119 --> 3176.319
create a new industry

3177.76 --> 3194.48
and the netherlands is very suitable for

3179.599 --> 3197.04
growing outside inside

3194.48 --> 3199.2
wheat is like mall weed okay i don't

3197.04 --> 3199.2
know

3205.2 --> 3209.52
yeah they had a whole medical marijuana

3208.079 --> 3212.559
situation

3209.52 --> 3215.68
starting up in the netherlands as well

3212.559 --> 3218.6400000000003
and then they literally murdered it they

3215.68 --> 3220.839
killed it they stopped it in its tracks

3218.64 --> 3223.2799999999997
started to basically

3220.839 --> 3226.72
attack yeah media attack

3223.28 --> 3227.44
people through the doctor boards and all

3226.72 --> 3229.9199999999996
that attack

3227.44 --> 3232.7200000000003
people that would use it that would

3229.92 --> 3232.7200000000003
prescribe it

3233.44 --> 3236.64
so i yeah i don't even know if that

3235.68 --> 3239.5989999999997
still exists

3236.64 --> 3243.44
if there even is such a thing as

3239.599 --> 3243.44
marijuana on prescription

3243.599 --> 3248.4
i think it's that they just abandoned it

3246.16 --> 3250.48
and it's just like okay

3248.4 --> 3252.319
the people themselves can figure out

3250.48 --> 3254.72
that it will work for glaucoma or

3252.319 --> 3259.2799999999997
whatever and then they just buy it

3254.72 --> 3262.0
and then maybe they get some kind of

3259.28 --> 3263.6800000000003
that they can just forward the bill to

3262.0 --> 3266.559
their insurance company i

3263.68 --> 3269.839
but i think that they don't even do that

3266.559 --> 3269.8390000000004
anymore it's just like

3269.92 --> 3273.28
they were gonna set up a system for real

3272.319 --> 3274.8
medical mana

3273.28 --> 3279.2000000000003
marijuana and then they sort of

3274.8 --> 3281.3590000000004
abandoned it i think

3279.2 --> 3283.5899999999997
it's really sad because it was very it

3281.359 --> 3286.4
was very interesting

incredibly important to many i can

3330.799 --> 3334.88
barely imagine it

3331.92 --> 3335.839
