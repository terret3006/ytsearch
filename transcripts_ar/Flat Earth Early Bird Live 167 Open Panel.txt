9.85 --> 41.13
[Music]

41.58 --> 49.449999999999996
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

45.04 --> 53.41
earlybird number 167 I'm your host

49.45 --> 56.35
Arwen and before I start the show please

53.41 --> 58.17999999999999
don't forget to share share the show and

56.35 --> 60.34
subscribe to my channel if you haven't

58.18 --> 62.97
already hit the bell notification so you

60.34 --> 65.44
know when I'm going live which is

62.97 --> 71.649
normally at 2:00 p.m.

65.44 --> 76.96
Amsterdam time the weather today is

71.649 --> 80.35
kinda sucky it seems to be cold windy

76.96 --> 82.57
and every now and then just buckets of

80.35 --> 87.119
rain come out of the air and then it

82.57 --> 87.119
stops again I guess it's typical spring

89.039 --> 97.92
right now it's not raining it did right

92.08 --> 97.92
before this no not even 15 minutes ago

99.13 --> 107.009
still the plants like it people maybe

104.229 --> 107.009
not so much

108.69 --> 115.38
so today's an open panel day so I'm

112.27 --> 120.25
gonna put the link in chat right now

115.38 --> 125.40899999999999
anyone who wants to join like a fourth

120.25 --> 128.92
hope to have multiple people on and if I

125.409 --> 133.18
do well this show could last for three

128.92 --> 135.16
hours if not probably not I'm not gonna

133.18 --> 137.37
keep on talking just by myself for three

135.16 --> 137.37
hours

138.18 --> 143.98000000000002
yeah reflecting back on yesterday I

141.39 --> 148.80999999999997
haven't actually watched the Hangout

143.98 --> 152.35
again I do remember it and it was it was

148.81 --> 154.89000000000001
good first then I guess this seems to

152.35 --> 160.319
happen more often between me and Ally be

154.89 --> 160.319
just bump heads and he gets in a

160.92 --> 169.14999999999998
opposition defiant mode towards me and

166.23 --> 171.97
gets stuck in that and that's kind of

169.15 --> 173.739
disruptive in my opinion I don't really

171.97 --> 177.82
know how to deal with it except just cut

173.739 --> 180.13
it off and I'm wondering if this keeps

177.82 --> 182.829
on going I'll have to do that a little

180.13 --> 186.43
bit earlier and just move the show on

182.829 --> 191.829
somehow because I did get a little

186.43 --> 194.32
annoyed by that but I don't I do blame

191.829 --> 197.20000000000002
leb for it and of course he's not gonna

194.32 --> 199.35899999999998
appreciate that but I I don't look down

197.2 --> 201.82
upon him I'm not angry at him or

199.359 --> 207.549
anything it's just a little annoying

201.82 --> 209.59
it's not something I hope to get used to

207.549 --> 212.38
but I'll figure out how to deal with

209.59 --> 214.84
this and still Ally B is very good for a

212.38 --> 217.18
conversation I think maybe it's better

214.84 --> 221.53
if there's just somebody else besides me

217.18 --> 224.9
also on the panel so a conversation can

221.53 --> 230.629
switch I think that would work better

224.9 --> 236.239
as a social chemistry anyway all that oh

230.629 --> 240.409
yeah I kind of got an invitation from my

236.239 --> 245.84
librarian friend to go to a gothic wave

240.409 --> 248.06
party a familiar location in Rotterdam

245.84 --> 250.94
it's actually the same location where I

248.06 --> 255.01
originally met my ex-girlfriend it was

250.94 --> 258.079
very unlikely to be there I hope and

255.01 --> 261.26
yeah I think I'm gonna go there tomorrow

258.079 --> 262.97
but it depends on the weather because if

261.26 --> 265.58
it's gonna be this kind of weather and

262.97 --> 273.139
rainy and [ __ ] that's very uncomfortable

265.58 --> 275.44899999999996
to be out for a long time and then

273.139 --> 280.55
having to go by public transport and

275.449 --> 287.08000000000004
everything so oh thank you for the super

280.55 --> 287.08
chat Rambo Jambo 10 Canadian dollars

287.53 --> 296.46999999999997
towards the P 900 keep up the great work

290.93 --> 300.74
yep thank you I will I am definitely

296.47 --> 303.22
saving it up not there yet though not

300.74 --> 303.22
for a while

305.86 --> 312.2
that's interesting yeah the problem is

308.81 --> 315.26
now and I have to face this somehow I

312.2 --> 320.24
did get like a second payment from

315.26 --> 326.59999999999997
Google which was very convenient at the

320.24 --> 328.73
time does the Eid it does pay out more

326.6 --> 330.85
regularly but I think and I already been

328.73 --> 335.3
warned about this I have to kind of

330.85 --> 338.27000000000004
report this to my government and theirs

335.3 --> 340.76
and this is like kind of the big

338.27 --> 342.79999999999995
disappointment on top of what Google

340.76 --> 345.28999999999996
already takes from the super Jets

342.8 --> 347.45
there's the advertisement just keeps on

345.29 --> 352.22
paying for itself it's not going to be

347.45 --> 355.15999999999997
that much but since it is a company

352.22 --> 356.99
structure I have to report it and

355.16 --> 363.85
there's a great likelihood that up to

356.99 --> 363.85
75% of what eventually got through that

363.94 --> 372.74
they will claim it back yeah it's

370.729 --> 376.34
another one of the reasons I'm not too

372.74 --> 379.93
overly enthusiastic to get jobs because

376.34 --> 379.92999999999995
they just take it off

382.21 --> 389.25899999999996
that problems not gonna be there through

385.03 --> 391.57
a paypal and yeah definitely not through

389.259 --> 393.97
paypal patreon I'm not too sure I don't

391.57 --> 395.889
know exactly how that works through

393.97 --> 399.43
PayPal I don't have that problem I can

395.889 --> 401.44
just take it as donations like handing

399.43 --> 403.96
cash over to people on the streets you

401.44 --> 406.21
don't have to report that if you get

403.96 --> 412.65999999999997
just happen to have hand it to some cash

406.21 --> 414.58
by somebody so yeah it's I haven't

412.66 --> 416.86
really considered it before it's kind of

414.58 --> 418.75
a bummer to talk about this now that I

416.86 --> 421.41
got the super chat the nation from Rambo

418.75 --> 427.24
Gemma which I do definitely appreciate

421.41 --> 430.84000000000003
but if I'm gonna have to save it all up

427.24 --> 436.72
through the super chat for p900 it's

430.84 --> 438.82
gonna take a very long time but I will

436.72 --> 442.3
just keep on going I'm mainly focusing

438.82 --> 445.69
on just keeping going with the show see

442.3 --> 449.61
if I can just bit by bit try to find

445.69 --> 449.61
little improvements I'm considering to

449.789 --> 458.46
making a systemized or a system to

454.949 --> 460.93
customize the Flat Earth early birth

458.46 --> 463.479
what is it something a little bit better

460.93 --> 466.81
because it wouldn't be that difficult to

463.479 --> 469.18
basically give the number and potential

466.81 --> 471.789
title of the flight of earlybird on the

469.18 --> 475.15000000000003
title screen afterward so it could

471.789 --> 477.909
literally see which episode it is you

475.15 --> 479.67999999999995
don't even have to read it you can just

477.909 --> 481.389
see it on the picture that would be kind

479.68 --> 484.44
of convenient and it wouldn't be that

481.389 --> 487.0
hard to do so I'm considering doing that

484.44 --> 492.37
probably not this evening it's probably

487.0 --> 497.889
gonna be so we're coming week but I am

492.37 --> 499.96
gonna make some folders on my computer

497.889 --> 505.09000000000003
to start working on that and link it so

499.96 --> 507.789
I don't forget about it and right yeah

505.09 --> 509.229
I'm just keep on building the show and

507.789 --> 511.77
also looking at other people what

509.229 --> 511.77
they're doing

511.96 --> 520.6899999999999
also get to see some more professional

515.589 --> 524.1690000000001
setups and also people that are kind of

520.69 --> 526.1800000000001
improvising professional setups and

524.169 --> 529.149
still managed to make it look really

526.18 --> 531.5799999999999
good and that is also interesting it's

529.149 --> 534.839
like keeping it relatively cheap cheap

531.58 --> 539.35
but still getting the effect you want

534.839 --> 541.0290000000001
and now if yeah I'm when it comes to my

539.35 --> 542.6800000000001
background there's not much of an effect

541.029 --> 544.42
currently in this very little

542.68 --> 547.27
maneuvering room for me to do anything

544.42 --> 552.04
about it in the future

547.27 --> 555.66
aha it's like ah you guys probably

552.04 --> 560.9399999999999
wanted I wanted even more just a real

555.66 --> 563.5889999999999
background left like a ton of gemstones

560.94 --> 566.1700000000001
flee even with some interesting lighting

563.589 --> 568.899
on them in the background interesting

566.17 --> 571.4799999999999
objects jewelry that would be a

568.899 --> 574.62
background a proper background for a

571.48 --> 574.62
wizard elf

574.86 --> 579.24
so no anyway

605.34 --> 616.7
right okay that's interesting thanks for

609.0 --> 620.07
the tip Swansea yeah 1984 the thing is

616.7 --> 626.9300000000001
yes there are certain ways you can

620.07 --> 630.779
basically bypass legally Social Welfare

626.93 --> 632.6999999999999
discounting system but it has to be in a

630.779 --> 637.4399999999999
specific format so it has to be like a

632.7 --> 640.1700000000001
gift or people lending you money that

637.44 --> 643.0500000000001
kind of thing and then they don't really

640.17 --> 644.5799999999999
mind you can just put it on that but if

643.05 --> 648.56
it's going to go through an official

644.58 --> 652.5
payment channel like what YouTube does

648.56 --> 656.0999999999999
then it's registered as being paid like

652.5 --> 665.67
a company and you can't really bypass

656.1 --> 667.95
that so in G look there's all kinds of

665.67 --> 673.68
money going in all directions with me

667.95 --> 677.3100000000001
and fiafia even and like I helped my dad

673.68 --> 680.8199999999999
out were through with the GTI like

677.31 --> 683.0699999999999
maneuvering a parent's capital as it

680.82 --> 688.62
were it's not really that much just

683.07 --> 691.7700000000001
helping him grow the network and at the

688.62 --> 694.8
same time he's pretty much capable of

691.77 --> 699.12
just kind of sort of borrowing or

694.8 --> 701.01
lending me money yeah and doesn't really

699.12 --> 704.67
need it back because he's doing really

701.01 --> 708.99
well and we got it yeah it's all pretty

704.67 --> 713.2199999999999
complicated networking setup how it all

708.99 --> 714.9
works what it works and there the Nia

713.22 --> 718.89
the potential for the future is

714.9 --> 722.75
fantastic for me or definitely good

718.89 --> 722.75
enough to survive and

724.66 --> 731.0799999999999
with potential for more so right use

729.04 --> 733.29
cryptocurrency that's really interesting

731.08 --> 736.1800000000001
because one of the developments

733.29 --> 739.18
apparently like GTI is going through a

736.18 --> 741.91
lot of developments I'm gonna not gonna

739.18 --> 744.13
go into details but what seems to have

741.91 --> 748.87
happened is that they to have switched

744.13 --> 750.97
to cryptocurrency because the banks are

748.87 --> 755.8
just too much of a hassle no matter

750.97 --> 761.2900000000001
every single bank they try to use to pay

755.8 --> 765.91
yet to basically pay out what is all

761.29 --> 767.68
processed in the company it's a

765.91 --> 769.6899999999999
complicated thing to explain not gonna

767.68 --> 772.39
explain it not even allowed to explain

769.69 --> 774.25
it to elaborately but yeah they're

772.39 --> 776.29
having trouble finding banks because the

774.25 --> 781.6
banks and their lawyers they don't like

776.29 --> 783.37
it because it's like no that's you're

781.6 --> 785.71
doing things that we don't like you're

783.37 --> 786.79
doing because that's what we're doing

785.71 --> 788.74
and we want to keep it to ourselves

786.79 --> 793.12
that's basically when it comes down

788.74 --> 796.03
until sort of you know the

793.12 --> 798.55
financialization systems are just

796.03 --> 800.56
growing and this is pretty good stuff

798.55 --> 803.17
and they know it and they don't like it

800.56 --> 807.3399999999999
so all banks are pretty much pushed by

803.17 --> 809.41
their peers by the Freemasons mainly to

807.34 --> 813.58
basically obstruct as much as possible

809.41 --> 817.4499999999999
and cryptocurrency is now considered a

813.58 --> 820.39
good escape from that because of the

817.45 --> 822.58
anonymity factors and it seems yeah it's

820.39 --> 825.37
very interesting it's new it's fresh to

822.58 --> 827.46
me have pretty much been just announced

825.37 --> 830.46
so it's funny that you bring it up

827.46 --> 830.46
mind-warped

832.59 --> 838.11
so we'll see where that goes and I have

835.47 --> 840.6
some criticism about cryptocurrency but

838.11 --> 846.71
it's mainly Bitcoin that it's extremely

840.6 --> 850.74
energy inefficient and I think that like

846.71 --> 854.9100000000001
transport and engines and all that has

850.74 --> 858.89
been developed to be more efficient and

854.91 --> 862.02
less environm environmentally unfriendly

858.89 --> 865.3199999999999
less polluting so should

862.02 --> 868.55
cryptocurrencies be developed in a more

865.32 --> 873.839
efficient and less energy-draining way

868.55 --> 875.49
with a clear like probably all

873.839 --> 877.1400000000001
cryptocurrencies would be almost like

875.49 --> 879.8100000000001
plants they would just grow and

877.14 --> 883.86
eventually they'd grow too big and then

879.81 --> 884.6099999999999
it because they they stagnate and then

883.86 --> 886.35
to keep growing

884.61 --> 888.51
another plant has to grow so it's almost

886.35 --> 896.1
like gardening with cryptocurrencies

888.51 --> 898.4399999999999
every cryptocurrency is bound by by how

896.1 --> 900.99
much energy it will eventually end up

898.44 --> 903.089
costing for it to grow and how much room

900.99 --> 906.72
it has and it's very interesting how

903.089 --> 910.2900000000001
that works but it can keep on going and

906.72 --> 912.95
Bitcoin was just early thing that can be

910.29 --> 915.66
enormous but it's just it becomes

912.95 --> 918.839
brutally inefficient energy wise it's

915.66 --> 921.93
already is so it definitely should not

918.839 --> 923.0400000000001
be made a standard what how am I

921.93 --> 925.6099999999999
Illuminati

923.04 --> 929.88
just because I understand how

925.61 --> 931.83
cryptocurrency is sort of work I'm not

929.88 --> 935.37
good at interfacing with this stuff yet

931.83 --> 937.94
I like still the conception of trading

935.37 --> 941.91
in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency is like

937.94 --> 944.4590000000001
baffling to me I died I died still don't

941.91 --> 949.91
get it from a first-person interface

944.459 --> 949.91
wise but how it develops I do get that

950.57 --> 956.0600000000001
paid a lot of attention to it so

959.54 --> 969.4699999999999
[Music]

978.54 --> 989.02
all right yeah the blockchain is the is

984.42 --> 994.81
the the way it's it is crypto crypto is

989.02 --> 997.17
kind of the function blockchain is the

994.81 --> 997.17
method

1004.5 --> 1007.76
or is the form

1015.16 --> 1032.81
and you wait yeah open panel here come

1022.37 --> 1039.02
on guys gals wants to join by the ways

1032.81 --> 1042.44
minor food update I I can still feel

1039.02 --> 1046.6399999999999
what happened two days ago in the

1042.44 --> 1049.43
evening what I did food I can still feel

1046.64 --> 1052.7900000000002
it now it is like when I drink alcohol

1049.43 --> 1057.1100000000001
I never feel it beyond half a day later

1052.79 --> 1063.71
never it's weird but I feel a lot better

1057.11 --> 1066.9799999999998
it seems like the biggest conflicts as

1063.71 --> 1070.25
it were or obstructions no energy

1066.98 --> 1073.01
barriers objections the biggest

1070.25 --> 1077.9
objections have all gone away so I think

1073.01 --> 1083.48
it's pretty much at least eighty percent

1077.9 --> 1086.24
out of my system I'll live you know I'll

1083.48 --> 1089.63
be great tomorrow as long as yeah it's

1086.24 --> 1091.22
not gonna be shitty weather because then

1089.63 --> 1097.18
I'm gonna be really disappointed because

1091.22 --> 1100.18
I'm looking kinda forward to dancing

1097.18 --> 1100.18
stuff

1100.38 --> 1107.21
being in a party meeting Tony again

1138.87 --> 1144.37
you know there's this effect again I

1143.14 --> 1150.0600000000002
don't know you could call it

1144.37 --> 1156.82
synchronicity maybe or it's just there

1150.06 --> 1159.19
it's just a way of thinking sometimes

1156.82 --> 1163.35
yeah I keep on I keep on watching

1159.19 --> 1168.19
Infowars and related channels and

1163.35 --> 1170.02
sometimes wander off into things that I

1168.19 --> 1174.01
normally wouldn't watch that are kind of

1170.02 --> 1177.8799999999999
related to it and it's interesting to

1174.01 --> 1180.82
see especially when for example Alex

1177.88 --> 1185.2800000000002
Jones is inspired by something it talks

1180.82 --> 1189.1599999999999
about something or even Owen Benjamin or

1185.28 --> 1192.16
many different people when they talk

1189.16 --> 1197.0500000000002
it's really fascinating because I start

1192.16 --> 1200.98
to recognize words and thinking patterns

1197.05 --> 1205.29
and structures of how things are said

1200.98 --> 1209.32
and then I figure out like holy [ __ ]

1205.29 --> 1211.78
it feels literally like they or some of

1209.32 --> 1215.2
them or at some point bumped into one of

1211.78 --> 1219.76
the videos that I make or that Nathan

1215.2 --> 1223.5
makes and is catching on the energy I

1219.76 --> 1226.72
like to recognize the energy signature

1223.5 --> 1228.58
it's very intuitive it's like clinging

1226.72 --> 1232.27
it's like a detection like yes I

1228.58 --> 1237.28
recognize a certain level of resonance

1232.27 --> 1240.7
and almost like as they're saying it

1237.28 --> 1242.05
they know and this is this is pure

1240.7 --> 1246.46
sensory so I'm not saying this is

1242.05 --> 1251.61
literal but as I see it it's like I feel

1246.46 --> 1251.6100000000001
they know that it's being taken note of

1252.12 --> 1258.28
like a recognition and they're kind of

1255.01 --> 1261.43
scared like okay how will be will it be

1258.28 --> 1263.56
read it's a super meta this is nothing

1261.43 --> 1264.0700000000002
you can take literally from what you're

1263.56 --> 1267.28
talking about

1264.07 --> 1268.87
all the the subtle energies just get

1267.28 --> 1270.35
this feeling like yeah they've been

1268.87 --> 1274.1899999999998
listening

1270.35 --> 1280.85
but they're kind of nervous on adapting

1274.19 --> 1282.47
it clearly but at the same time with

1280.85 --> 1285.649
their narratives and everything they

1282.47 --> 1288.23
have great confidence again it's how it

1285.649 --> 1291.4089999999999
does kind of it is the right thing to do

1288.23 --> 1293.48
but I detect these subtleties like like

1291.409 --> 1297.409
they are paying attention to what we're

1293.48 --> 1300.8600000000001
doing or maybe that is just a mistake

1297.409 --> 1303.679
I can't admit that as possible and then

1300.86 --> 1305.6899999999998
it just it's like the hundredth monkey

1303.679 --> 1308.0
effect and we just all happen to

1305.69 --> 1310.3990000000001
resonate in that way and at some point

1308.0 --> 1313.899
they just pick up on it naturally by

1310.399 --> 1318.86
themselves or through another group that

1313.899 --> 1321.799
is kind of using the same tactics they

1318.86 --> 1324.379
may have heard it from us or you know

1321.799 --> 1326.84
internet thing sprang spread around and

1324.379 --> 1329.57
when something is right people would

1326.84 --> 1332.509
take kind of they can't help but

1329.57 --> 1334.4289999999999
assimilate it copy it and then learn how

1332.509 --> 1338.6490000000001
to express it themselves because it

1334.429 --> 1342.3400000000001
gives them strength it's like a chance a

1338.649 --> 1345.6789999999999
spell that brings some energy into it

1342.34 --> 1348.59
and when you're into that when you're

1345.679 --> 1350.69
tuned to doing that then yeah you you

1348.59 --> 1353.6589999999999
want to do that because it brings some

1350.69 --> 1355.669
animal brings some energy and then

1353.659 --> 1357.3790000000001
you've usually people forget about it

1355.669 --> 1362.24
again and they just wonder like yeah

1357.379 --> 1365.139
what was it doing how did that work but

1362.24 --> 1365.139
I just take notice

1367.03 --> 1375.82
awakening elements ways of saying things

1370.34 --> 1379.1899999999998
ways of looking at it for example and

1375.82 --> 1382.0
Alex Jones it's also about the way you

1379.19 --> 1384.799
express what you're thinking about and

1382.0 --> 1387.62
that is something that I personally work

1384.799 --> 1390.44
on a lot that is probably my main

1387.62 --> 1395.84
focuses on giving a detailed description

1390.44 --> 1398.419
of very ethereal processes and I get the

1395.84 --> 1404.2099999999998
idea that others are taking it over

1398.419 --> 1406.8500000000001
maybe discovering it themselves for

1404.21 --> 1410.8700000000001
example Alex Jones would for explain

1406.85 --> 1413.87
very complicated things ten years ago we

1410.87 --> 1415.79
do it quite interestingly but he would

1413.87 --> 1422.87
always be hopping from image to image

1415.79 --> 1425.33
and now he is on the same level as me

1422.87 --> 1428.9899999999998
explaining multi-level narrative and

1425.33 --> 1431.75
really feeling the frequency difference

1428.99 --> 1433.88
and expressing it through the sound or

1431.75 --> 1436.85
underneath the sound of your voice like

1433.88 --> 1439.4
really understanding and there's other

1436.85 --> 1442.059
people as well and this is the Met it's

1439.4 --> 1444.98
the magic of true understanding and

1442.059 --> 1447.1689999999999
expressing the frequency of it not

1444.98 --> 1448.58
necessarily the words in the saying but

1447.169 --> 1451.01
when you truly understand it you can

1448.58 --> 1457.12
express the frequency of it and that is

1451.01 --> 1457.12
something that is fascinating to people

1457.419 --> 1462.0700000000002
so ethereal talk

1462.85 --> 1465.9299999999998
[Music]

1468.799 --> 1484.5
okay more talk about cryptocurrency I

1471.33 --> 1491.789
see now warp mind don't add a video link

1484.5 --> 1498.78
but oh this if you want to send me some

1491.789 --> 1503.15
link then do it over Skype please I

1498.78 --> 1506.1499999999999
think my dad is trying to try to call me

1503.15 --> 1506.15
weird

1528.59 --> 1535.9499999999998
well mind-warped or I know wait

1532.85 --> 1538.8
they Billy was a that's a funny and

1535.95 --> 1542.52
controversial thing to say you know what

1538.8 --> 1546.54
I'll admit it is something that me and

1542.52 --> 1549.57
my brother to my 20 years ago that's

1546.54 --> 1555.99
what we believed you have to be it has

1549.57 --> 1563.52
to has to be like in intelligentsia

1555.99 --> 1566.27
autocracy the world has to be ruled and

1563.52 --> 1569.46
taken care of by the intelligent

1566.27 --> 1573.2
unfortunately he had as we all learned

1569.46 --> 1577.6200000000001
that doesn't really always work out so

1573.2 --> 1583.16
but something that could be similar it's

1577.62 --> 1586.5
not a direct IQ test which is very it's

1583.16 --> 1589.6100000000001
it's not a good measuring safe system

1586.5 --> 1593.19
but what you could do is just do

1589.61 --> 1598.8899999999999
political awareness it's almost kind of

1593.19 --> 1601.41
silly though well like a citizenship

1598.89 --> 1602.97
test for example in the United States if

1601.41 --> 1604.89
you want to become a citizen you have to

1602.97 --> 1606.84
know like the Constitution certain

1604.89 --> 1608.8700000000001
things you have to be able to pronounce

1606.84 --> 1611.4599999999998
the language in certain ways I think

1608.87 --> 1613.86
maybe they changed this I don't know

1611.46 --> 1616.32
that is how I remember it

1613.86 --> 1618.12
in the Netherlands it is kind of like

1616.32 --> 1620.01
that too but they're a little bit more

1618.12 --> 1622.9799999999998
lenient if you're just really good at

1620.01 --> 1625.35
English and you can just get around with

1622.98 --> 1627.8700000000001
that then I guess they kind of find it

1625.35 --> 1633.2099999999998
okay as well I don't know we're so

1627.87 --> 1636.12
liberal but now I completely lost track

1633.21 --> 1638.33
of what I was saying oh yeah test what

1636.12 --> 1641.61
they could do is okay if you wanna vote

1638.33 --> 1644.6699999999998
then you don't have to do like a kind of

1641.61 --> 1648.29
basic examination about the subjects

1644.67 --> 1650.73
that are being dealt with how about that

1648.29 --> 1652.6499999999999
well on the other hand that's probably

1650.73 --> 1656.039
gonna discourage a lot of people from

1652.65 --> 1658.8500000000001
voting on the other hand there's

1656.039 --> 1663.029
entire big group of people that is very

1658.85 --> 1667.139
aware of issues that will definitely do

1663.029 --> 1671.639
that so it's an interesting thing to

1667.139 --> 1674.609
consider on the long run something that

1671.639 --> 1680.519
could be proposed and forwarded just to

1674.609 --> 1682.59
make a to see and doesn't have to be

1680.519 --> 1685.08
that difficult look an intelligence test

1682.59 --> 1686.6689999999999
it's just ya know great so that means

1685.08 --> 1688.499
that not a lot of people are gonna have

1686.669 --> 1691.6090000000002
to put gonna be allowed to vote that's

1688.499 --> 1694.169
just that's just brilliant

1691.609 --> 1698.46
but if you just have an awareness test

1694.169 --> 1702.0900000000001
then the people at least can basically

1698.46 --> 1706.289
be pushed have the facts pushed in their

1702.09 --> 1710.869
faces as they are in the ones to vote or

1706.289 --> 1710.869
the to make a decision on something and

1711.679 --> 1717.419
potentially be snapped out of yeah

1714.779 --> 1719.97
politicized dreams illusions that have

1717.419 --> 1722.249
been woven for them they could be

1719.97 --> 1724.97
snapped out of it just by forcing an

1722.249 --> 1728.489
understanding of the actual issues I

1724.97 --> 1730.919
don't know it's it could even counter

1728.489 --> 1735.179
some of the manipulations from the media

1730.919 --> 1738.179
on the other hand yeah who is gonna it

1735.179 --> 1740.8200000000002
could be subjected to some serious

1738.179 --> 1742.8590000000002
serious corruption of course because

1740.82 --> 1744.479
it's technically the same group as the

1742.859 --> 1746.34
media took hold of it then they could

1744.479 --> 1749.6390000000001
basically say you know yeah if you're

1746.34 --> 1752.009
not in an insanely liberal nutcase you

1749.639 --> 1753.84
can't vote because you fail the test

1752.009 --> 1762.95
yeah that could happen that's the

1753.84 --> 1765.809
ultimate shitty 1984 nightmare crap so

1762.95 --> 1769.159
it's something to consider but you it

1765.809 --> 1771.779
needs to be secured against that

1769.159 --> 1778.249
otherwise it's just gonna be a nightmare

1771.779 --> 1778.249
so yeah ideas always bring risks

1781.66 --> 1784.66
ha

1792.1 --> 1805.33
so where's my bad no I threw the Lincoln

1799.429 --> 1805.3300000000002
half an hour ago Wow guys

1806.67 --> 1809.729
[Music]

1830.83 --> 1841.54
all right and okay that is so typical

1834.79 --> 1845.77
that Lahti right the weird of I don't

1841.54 --> 1850.93
know kind of prostitute troll I would

1845.77 --> 1853.99
say telling others is too bad a guy that

1850.93 --> 1856.0
is is obviously a baller and and kind of

1853.99 --> 1857.92
annoying sometimes

1856.0 --> 1860.25
but does at least bring in good

1857.92 --> 1863.94
questions sometimes that's so funny a

1860.25 --> 1863.94
lot you would ask that

1873.01 --> 1879.64
yeah and you're right for in each I

1876.84 --> 1881.5
prefer to do the banning myself just if

1879.64 --> 1883.9
somebody gets really disgusting or

1881.5 --> 1887.41
there's some disgusting troll name that

1883.9 --> 1889.0590000000002
is really what I need moderators for

1887.41 --> 1891.45
because I can't keep track of everything

1889.059 --> 1894.309
in chapter all the time

1891.45 --> 1896.74
and if somebody's gonna be a spamming

1894.309 --> 1899.08
troll or just spamming questions

1896.74 --> 1901.32
constantly that are annoying I'll deal

1899.08 --> 1901.32
with it

1902.88 --> 1907.95
yeah fake accounts and all that that's

1905.47 --> 1907.95
perfect

1909.9 --> 1917.2900000000002
yes Lottie Lottie you are a prostitute

1913.78 --> 1920.79
role you're a troll but you like

1917.29 --> 1924.21
genuinely help out anyone on any side

1920.79 --> 1924.21
like a prostitute

1931.96 --> 1941.039
yeah oh [ __ ] there's the rain coming

1936.879 --> 1941.039
again yep

1952.2 --> 1955.309
all right

1967.68 --> 1970.8600000000001
all right

1974.69 --> 1978.3490000000002
[Music]

1982.679 --> 1987.3700000000001
nice one say I never said you were a

1985.33 --> 1989.9499999999998
troll you can get a little troll ish

1987.37 --> 1995.6499999999999
though but you're not a troll because

1989.95 --> 1999.97
you do seem to ask well more than just

1995.65 --> 2002.929
superficial questions and you do try to

1999.97 --> 2005.49
bring our details that are very bullish

2002.929 --> 2008.52
but at least you seem to kind of be

2005.49 --> 2011.16
trying and not just regurgitate obvious

2008.52 --> 2013.11
annoying [ __ ] so I don't think

2011.16 --> 2017.429
you're a troll you're very annoying at

2013.11 --> 2024.8999999999999
times though but yeah you know Daniel

2017.429 --> 2026.52
can be the same and yeah I guess I can

2024.9 --> 2033.299
be a little bit annoying at times as

2026.52 --> 2035.25
well that's especially when people start

2033.299 --> 2039.12
talking about snakes and that kind of

2035.25 --> 2044.309
nonsense no not you Daniel fields now

2039.12 --> 2047.78
you're fine no Daniel D the guy that

2044.309 --> 2047.78
never shuts up once he joins

2056.27 --> 2060.77
don't worry about it you're great

2062.909 --> 2066.069
[Music]

2066.36 --> 2075.9700000000003
actually your your good enough to get a

2071.11 --> 2082.3
wrench I'd say we'll see

2075.97 --> 2085.8999999999996
I do need a few more moderators because

2082.3 --> 2089.29
it yeah and I'm happy to say I get a lot

2085.9 --> 2092.02
more people visiting me in chat actual

2089.29 --> 2094.15
people not just trolls or d troll and

2092.02 --> 2099.13
the thousands of sock accounts that come

2094.15 --> 2108.1
with it still don't know who is actually

2099.13 --> 2110.85
doing that yeah then you feel we can we

2108.1 --> 2110.85
all have our moments

2133.57 --> 2137.61
but that's funny

2139.579 --> 2147.7200000000003
a David read you you know this is like

2145.559 --> 2154.2000000000003
gonna geeky but you know that's like a

2147.72 --> 2157.5
song it was even kind of mainstreamed

2154.2 --> 2161.7599999999998
song from the cardigans I'm only happy

2157.5 --> 2166.289
when it rains is really kind of negative

2161.76 --> 2169.0490000000004
though in a sort of gothic but enough

2166.289 --> 2174.15
gothic way I used to like it

2169.049 --> 2177.059
I actually it's weird I I used that van

2174.15 --> 2180.15
kinda to transit into the Gothic from

2177.059 --> 2181.349
more being a more kind of a hippie guy

2180.15 --> 2184.36
it was weird

2181.349 --> 2186.8900000000003
it's a weird man I still have their CDs

2184.36 --> 2188.1800000000003
[Laughter]

2186.89 --> 2196.799
garbage

2188.18 --> 2200.24
guardians oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] no wait ah now

2196.799 --> 2206.549
I'm mixing it up they did have another

2200.24 --> 2208.7099999999996
wasn't it similar [ __ ] man I'm [ __ ]

2206.549 --> 2212.97
there's so many music things that

2208.71 --> 2218.4
happened 20 years ago I'm starting to

2212.97 --> 2221.8089999999997
get old garbage I don't even remember

2218.4 --> 2221.809
what that was

2225.609 --> 2232.459
I'm gonna have to look it up on YouTube

2228.999 --> 2233.8999999999996
I'm totally embarrassed man that's

2232.459 --> 2245.509
really embarrassing when I get music

2233.9 --> 2251.2690000000002
things wrong hmm right yeah that was

2245.509 --> 2255.619
like from the 90s all these all these

2251.269 --> 2260.979
women and yeah I've never actually seen

2255.619 --> 2260.9790000000003
I just heard it on the radio a lot

2261.729 --> 2270.759
typical okay well right so let's skip

2267.589 --> 2273.349
over that let's forget all about that I

2270.759 --> 2275.619
did like the cardigans though it was

2273.349 --> 2275.619
weird

2284.22 --> 2290.74
maybe it was cardigans had a lot of

2287.82 --> 2298.3300000000004
passive-aggressiveness like I kind of

2290.74 --> 2300.52
dig that I don't know it's not something

2298.33 --> 2304.48
I would be actively looking for in a

2300.52 --> 2306.79
woman though these days anyway

2304.48 --> 2311.76
I don't know or maybe that kind of thing

2306.79 --> 2311.7599999999998
just strikes me however that works Oh

2313.11 --> 2321.34
God

2314.5 --> 2323.5
yeah stares Moretz you had that song I'm

2321.34 --> 2326.59
losing my favorite game our God yeah but

2323.5 --> 2334.35
that's definitely one of those songs

2326.59 --> 2338.82
they play a lot that's that song is evil

2334.35 --> 2338.8199999999997
like in a succubus kind of way

2353.75 --> 2363.45
okay Lottie says well you know it's up

2359.7 --> 2365.3999999999996
to you if you think it's unfortunate

2363.45 --> 2369.029
you're near not a prostitute

2365.4 --> 2370.98
I think there's I don't know if you

2369.029 --> 2373.49
don't mind putting up clown makeup and

2370.98 --> 2377.48
everything I think there's probably a

2373.49 --> 2382.1699999999996
prostitution job for you in some way oh

2377.48 --> 2390.7690000000002
maybe I wouldn't recommend it not even

2382.17 --> 2394.609
to you but that's just really disgusting

2390.769 --> 2394.609
shouldn't if you brought that up

2403.619 --> 2408.96
right for need yeah that's right the

2405.93 --> 2412.89
first album it's weird

2408.96 --> 2416.19
I really like that man and that can date

2412.89 --> 2418.259
it was like this CD era so there was no

2416.19 --> 2420.18
downloading music from the internet yet

2418.259 --> 2422.63
so if you really like something you have

2420.18 --> 2422.6299999999997
to buy it

2457.17 --> 2463.23
[ __ ] that was weird

2471.69 --> 2478.049
yeah

2474.339 --> 2483.63
like these they might recognize him

2478.049 --> 2483.63
probably not I don't know but that was

2493.65 --> 2500.1890000000003
that's all pretty old old stuff about me

2505.38 --> 2512.65
it's like still in the time when with my

2508.749 --> 2515.589
third girlfriend that for that time was

2512.65 --> 2517.839
very serious for me and she kind of

2515.589 --> 2523.3289999999997
liked the cardigans - it was weird then

2517.839 --> 2527.339
they kind of went dark and then the

2523.329 --> 2527.3390000000004
relationship broke off like she just

2527.67 --> 2534.16
detached and wandered off was very

2530.799 --> 2537.729
serene about it and I I was kind of okay

2534.16 --> 2541.469
with it but I still like I enjoyed it

2537.729 --> 2544.66
with so much detail her she was such a

2541.469 --> 2550.569
radiant person to me I just missed her a

2544.66 --> 2553.239
lot and went very dramatic and then even

2550.569 --> 2557.049
spiraled a bit and dove into the

2553.239 --> 2559.979
darkness the gothic scene she didn't

2557.049 --> 2559.979
like that at all

2561.719 --> 2568.829
weird [ __ ] and of course my mother

2566.199 --> 2572.009
getting sick and all that it was

2568.829 --> 2572.009
difficult time

2572.949 --> 2584.39
anyway now I'm not gonna play music

2581.18 --> 2586.18
footage because every time I seem to be

2584.39 --> 2589.209
playing some kind of music that wasn't

2586.18 --> 2593.8999999999996
specifically made for me by somebody

2589.209 --> 2596.719
then YouTube's like D monetizes the

2593.9 --> 2599.719
video I'm really annoyed by it I am

2596.719 --> 2603.14
considering then maybe I should have

2599.719 --> 2610.279
like a non-monetized show where I do

2603.14 --> 2613.5989999999997
play music just all the time almost like

2610.279 --> 2617.15
a I guess it would be in the direction

2613.599 --> 2623.029
in the format of what Assad sometimes

2617.15 --> 2624.65
just music and a chat it's not gonna be

2623.029 --> 2627.14
difficult I wouldn't be have to be

2624.65 --> 2629.39
talking all the time anyway don't make

2627.14 --> 2633.949
it a lot easier in the evening when I

2629.39 --> 2635.9
don't have as much energy unless I

2633.949 --> 2638.679
properly prepare ah Thank You Daniel

2635.9 --> 2643.449
field for the one pound seventy six

2638.679 --> 2643.449
super chat donation much appreciated

2653.71 --> 2664.9900000000002
yeah so still nobody coming in here it's

2660.37 --> 2679.72
42 minutes I really appreciate the super

2664.99 --> 2681.79
chat donations though right oh yeah well

2679.72 --> 2684.1299999999997
Daniel filled you you've been around for

2681.79 --> 2688.12
a long time and I trust you you're a

2684.13 --> 2691.06
nice guy don't get into fights a lot as

2688.12 --> 2692.56
far as I can see you do back and forth

2691.06 --> 2694.9
with ballers but you don't get

2692.56 --> 2697.08
aggressive so yeah I trust you with the

2694.9 --> 2697.08
wrench

2706.91 --> 2715.19
I guess the ballers are afraid of me

2711.97 --> 2719.8689999999997
well the funny thing though is is that

2715.19 --> 2724.549
they should know now that I might even

2719.869 --> 2728.6600000000003
if they can keep themselves from delving

2724.549 --> 2731.24
into like flat-faced lies devious

2728.66 --> 2732.68
tactics in communication if they can

2731.24 --> 2739.16
prevent themselves from doing it and

2732.68 --> 2740.93
being totally honest at least consider

2739.16 --> 2744.74
that they are riding on a

2740.93 --> 2747.3489999999997
presuppositional belief which is yeah

2744.74 --> 2751.0089999999996
doesn't give them as much weight but

2747.349 --> 2755.089
could still it isn't just completely

2751.009 --> 2757.5190000000002
useless like like it is literally still

2755.089 --> 2759.019
a chance as long as they can recognize

2757.519 --> 2762.1899999999996
that in the end then I'll have a lot of

2759.019 --> 2768.319
respect for them and I'll help them out

2762.19 --> 2774.98
in figuring out conceptualizations or

2768.319 --> 2777.5
even presuppositional puzzles but if

2774.98 --> 2781.97
they will start to like get offended

2777.5 --> 2785.599
when I basically prick through globe

2781.97 --> 2787.0989999999997
illusions when they use it to brag or

2785.599 --> 2790.009
something to start to go off like that

2787.099 --> 2792.559
yeah and they and they then go into more

2790.009 --> 2799.2400000000002
offensive behavior I will crack them

2792.559 --> 2803.3590000000004
open absolutely absolutely I will

2799.24 --> 2806.359
and I'll even be kind of careful at

2803.359 --> 2810.0989999999997
first not to destroy them outright kind

2806.359 --> 2814.0
of like what Nathan does or attempts

2810.099 --> 2818.029
because but I will end up doing that if

2814.0 --> 2820.19
like if it's like if you're gonna sin in

2818.029 --> 2826.029
my presence communicating with me then

2820.19 --> 2828.799
you will get the proper retribution oh

2826.029 --> 2831.95
thank you for the $2 approach a donation

2828.799 --> 2836.19
Theo Megawati you need proper link

2831.95 --> 2846.089
posted for guest access I did do that

2836.19 --> 2849.89
ah I'll do it again I guess anyway

2846.089 --> 2849.89
here's the link again

2855.18 --> 2871.33
mmm-hmm did I didn't put it out in the

2858.67 --> 2877.42
early where it sorry put it there and in

2871.33 --> 2885.72
the master be chat as well and I have so

2877.42 --> 2889.08
much activity or is the master be chat

2885.72 --> 2889.08
and there it is

2893.62 --> 2897.4
[Music]

2898.709 --> 2904.839
right so don't forget to share the show

2901.799 --> 2908.2
especially with people you think that

2904.839 --> 2912.969
may want to discuss things or introduce

2908.2 --> 2919.66
themselves to the scene or discusses a

2912.969 --> 2923.2490000000003
topic or a fringe topic even or a media

2919.66 --> 2923.249
event it's all cool

2927.87 --> 2930.87
what

2931.51 --> 2934.51
ellipses

2944.62 --> 2947.94
what are you talking about

2949.44 --> 2954.02
and I'm not called Arwen thank you very

2952.26 --> 2960.5400000000004
much

2954.02 --> 2963.92
III don't see it's just the code it

2960.54 --> 2969.8
should work yeah here I'll fan event

2963.92 --> 2969.8
skeptic just joined hello

2971.24 --> 2983.24
okay you hear me Billy was a lor weed

2980.24 --> 2983.24
yeah

2983.45 --> 2989.58
what's that you hear me yeah Billy I can

2988.11 --> 2998.01
hear you thanks for joining

2989.58 --> 3001.91
event skeptic can't hear you couldn't

2998.01 --> 3002.71
are gonna win ah hello thanks for

3001.91 --> 3006.3799999999997
joining

3002.71 --> 3012.17
Scelzi Swansea in 1984 where are you get

3006.38 --> 3019.67
on the air give shift backs I also wanna

3012.17 --> 3022.25
say yeah I mean yeah I don't I don't

3019.67 --> 3030.56
think he'd get in the panel seems to be

3022.25 --> 3035.54
very much it chat dweller what are you

3030.56 --> 3044.12
coming back to the globe Arwen huh

3035.54 --> 3048.62
is that Tim no maybe all right well I'm

3044.12 --> 3051.37
not coming back to the globe I'm there

3048.62 --> 3056.45
I'm just not believing it that's all

3051.37 --> 3058.6099999999997
yeah I can I totally get how the

3056.45 --> 3064.79
heliocentrism works and I kind of

3058.61 --> 3066.77
appreciate it as an art noticed but I'm

3064.79 --> 3071.17
not gonna believe that that is literally

3066.77 --> 3076.28
real because they've got too much yeah

3071.17 --> 3077.63
empirical all to the contrary what's

3076.28 --> 3081.32
wrong with that

3077.63 --> 3086.15
it doesn't work what doesn't work about

3081.32 --> 3090.7400000000002
it everything like what like the gas

3086.15 --> 3093.59
pressure next to a vacuum it's not next

3090.74 --> 3096.77
to a vacuum out pressure gradient dude

3093.59 --> 3100.8700000000003
yeah but in the greater scheme of things

3096.77 --> 3103.49
in the scale of the universe it is

3100.87 --> 3106.16
there's nothing to join them there's

3103.49 --> 3110.6
nothing to bind the gas pressure to a

3106.16 --> 3112.94
specific region except gravity right

3110.6 --> 3116.9
that you have to deny that'll just give

3112.94 --> 3119.7200000000003
a little extra nudge literally like a

3116.9 --> 3123.14
nudge so it might increase the gas

3119.72 --> 3126.95
pressure just slightly in relation to

3123.14 --> 3129.23
the entire container and that is it what

3126.95 --> 3131.5099999999998
are we not create the gradient as we

3129.23 --> 3133.22
experience it where are you getting to

3131.51 --> 3134.84
information about gas pressure and

3133.22 --> 3137.2999999999997
containers and stuff you guys think that

3134.84 --> 3141.6800000000003
you really in figure over all of science

3137.3 --> 3143.6000000000004
and stuff yes well there's your problem

3141.68 --> 3147.29
right there but it's a natural law it's

3143.6 --> 3151.13
it's old it's never been like thrown

3147.29 --> 3156.11
aside Edison whatever container if you

3151.13 --> 3158.9300000000003
have gas pressure yes where's that it is

3156.11 --> 3161.27
in physics it is use it is applied it is

3158.93 --> 3166.6099999999997
taught what's it called

3161.27 --> 3169.39
cuz I've never seen it well I think the

3166.61 --> 3171.86
colloquial term for it is entropy

3169.39 --> 3176.87
well entropy has nothing to do with the

3171.86 --> 3181.88
gas pressure my container did yes it

3176.87 --> 3184.43
does no it doesn't yes it's the natural

3181.88 --> 3186.44
tendencies for gas pressure to expand

3184.43 --> 3189.23
within the container and find an

3186.44 --> 3192.11
equilibrium after which potentially a

3189.23 --> 3194.9900000000002
gradient could come into being that is

3192.11 --> 3198.1
after the equilibrium has been found

3194.99 --> 3201.5299999999997
within the container yes yes it does

3198.1 --> 3205.04
like hydrostatic equilibrium like having

3201.53 --> 3207.8900000000003
a slightly less - pressure or a slightly

3205.04 --> 3210.32
less dense gas thanks cool slightly less

3207.89 --> 3214.3689999999997
dense gas up and up and out

3210.32 --> 3217.17
sure all depends on the content of the

3214.369 --> 3220.53
chamber if you're gonna simulate this in

3217.17 --> 3223.9500000000003
small what the gas content is going to

3220.53 --> 3227.1600000000003
be if you first have a container and

3223.95 --> 3229.47
there's guests of all types in heavy gas

3227.16 --> 3236.7
and very light gas say for example you

3229.47 --> 3240.29
combine helium and what's the other one

3236.7 --> 3243.72
co2 it's a heavy gas you combine that

3240.29 --> 3246.9
now if you fill in half and a half

3243.72 --> 3249.6299999999997
yeah the chamber definitely the helium

3246.9 --> 3253.6800000000003
is very likely to end up gonna sit on

3249.63 --> 3255.2400000000002
top of the co2 might even be visible I

3253.68 --> 3256.83
don't know how that works all depends

3255.24 --> 3258.81
probably on the total pressure within

3256.83 --> 3260.609
the chamber you're gonna see that that

3258.81 --> 3263.2799999999997
gradients gonna naturally form until

3260.609 --> 3265.859
something moves it then yeah it might

3263.28 --> 3269.52
even almost like a bucket of water start

3265.859 --> 3271.7999999999997
to form waves within it but if you're

3269.52 --> 3274.95
then gonna open the side to a vacuum

3271.8 --> 3276.63
chamber it's all just gonna get sucked

3274.95 --> 3279.33
in there very quickly it's not gonna

3276.63 --> 3281.01
discriminate as to which one is the

3279.33 --> 3283.47
heavier and the lighter it's just all

3281.01 --> 3286.0800000000004
gonna be sucked in its entirety or

3283.47 --> 3288.3489999999997
pushed literally that's literally what's

3286.08 --> 3291.69
happening into the vacuum chamber and

3288.349 --> 3293.4
all gonna be mixed and then until the

3291.69 --> 3296.13
equilibrium has been found and then

3293.4 --> 3298.02
suddenly the rush is over the gas

3296.13 --> 3301.4700000000003
pressure has the gas pressure has found

3298.02 --> 3305.7599999999998
its equilibrium and then the two layers

3301.47 --> 3308.3689999999997
will start to separate again you know

3305.76 --> 3311.1600000000003
the relative density concept and then

3308.369 --> 3314.849
the two containers the same gradient

3311.16 --> 3316.589
will form you know vacuums don't suck I

3314.849 --> 3319.6800000000003
mean this is all that's why I said

3316.589 --> 3322.38
blowdown be so freakin pedantic so ya

3319.68 --> 3325.08
literally described in my explanation

3322.38 --> 3325.8
don't be square though you know that'll

3325.08 --> 3327.81
be pedantic

3325.8 --> 3330.8390000000004
I literally explained it in the

3327.81 --> 3333.119
explanation you said suck in the

3330.839 --> 3335.849
explanation and then I explained it's

3333.119 --> 3338.79
actually blow literally in the

3335.849 --> 3343.69
explanation don't be pedantic you never

3338.79 --> 3347.92
said yes I did yes I did No

3343.69 --> 3350.289
my keys on now did I did or when you

3347.92 --> 3352.78
guys it's a son record it's on record

3350.289 --> 3355.3900000000003
that I did that I literally explained it

3352.78 --> 3355.96
with first I said it's gonna be sucked

3355.39 --> 3359.6189999999997
in there

3355.96 --> 3363.64
actually it's blown cuz gas pressure

3359.619 --> 3366.789
pushes I literally said that well you

3363.64 --> 3369.069
can go back it's okay yeah I can go it's

3366.789 --> 3370.8390000000004
there now we're not talking about this

3369.069 --> 3374.68
or I'm gonna kick you out okay let's

3370.839 --> 3375.52
move on yeah I was trying to write so

3374.68 --> 3379.0
get on with it

3375.52 --> 3379.27
what's blow and what's your response to

3379.0 --> 3381.099
it

3379.27 --> 3386.95
that's a gradient within the vacuum

3381.099 --> 3390.19
chamber after the first off okay so it

3386.95 --> 3394.21
doesn't suck pusher blow a vacuum it's

3390.19 --> 3397.42
not a Hoover right okay give me a good

3394.21 --> 3398.829
reason not to kick you do you agree with

3397.42 --> 3401.23
me there that it doesn't suck blower

3398.829 --> 3403.059
Bush yeah you agree with me because I

3401.23 --> 3407.44
was the one that actually brought that

3403.059 --> 3410.02
forth so you do agree that it doesn't

3407.44 --> 3411.9700000000003
suck yeah you agree with me that's right

3410.02 --> 3414.52
I'm asking you a question yeah and I'm

3411.97 --> 3416.41
telling you that's right you agree with

3414.52 --> 3417.329
me because I was the one that brought

3416.41 --> 3420.0389999999998
that up

3417.329 --> 3425.789
yes you said push then now you're saying

3420.039 --> 3430.3190000000004
blow right push blow

3425.789 --> 3434.17
doesn't matter it's yes always pressure

3430.319 --> 3436.63
pushes it blows so they make the second

3434.17 --> 3439.599
law of thermodynamics and nobody but

3436.63 --> 3441.7000000000003
Nathan Oakley in qualm eraser' figure

3439.599 --> 3444.4300000000003
out that it's a violation a second law

3441.7 --> 3446.98
of thermodynamics violation nobody

3444.43 --> 3451.0589999999997
thought of that before Nathan Oakley and

3446.98 --> 3453.22
quantum erasers that we saw me know we

3451.059 --> 3457.1090000000004
did thought think about it and we hadn't

3453.22 --> 3459.64
just figured out a physics related

3457.109 --> 3465.339
system tied in to that but definitely

3459.64 --> 3467.74
yeah we about it three years ago you

3465.339 --> 3470.23
have videos oh yeah they're on my second

3467.74 --> 3472.089
oh yes no I didn't mention it but I did

3470.23 --> 3475.21
mention the vacuum next to the gas

3472.089 --> 3477.549
pressure absolutely I did as I said I

3475.21 --> 3482.309
just didn't really tie it in

3477.549 --> 3486.099
to physics yet but I knew it was there I

3482.309 --> 3488.1090000000004
knew that wasn't right and I already

3486.099 --> 3490.509
figured out even back then that gravity

3488.109 --> 3492.699
and I heard this through people that is

3490.509 --> 3496.149
a complication with gravity because it's

3492.699 --> 3498.9990000000003
not strong enough to oppose entropy

3496.149 --> 3501.13
force the gas pressure it's too strong

3498.999 --> 3503.979
opposing the entire outer space universe

3501.13 --> 3505.569
can't work unless the entire outer space

3503.979 --> 3508.8089999999997
is not outer space but outer gas

3505.569 --> 3511.089
pressure slightly less gas pressure then

3508.809 --> 3515.409
should be on earth otherwise that can't

3511.089 --> 3517.899
exist and then about how to celestial

3515.409 --> 3519.2490000000003
things move supposedly they are physical

3517.899 --> 3520.5989999999997
objects out there that's going to be

3519.249 --> 3523.149
another problem because there's gonna be

3520.599 --> 3527.4390000000003
friction and more weird things going on

3523.149 --> 3531.489
it's it's all a giant mess well friction

3527.439 --> 3534.239
in space now Arwen well there wouldn't

3531.489 --> 3536.7690000000002
be space there would be gas pressure

3534.239 --> 3539.199
you're talking about other planets in

3536.769 --> 3542.9489999999996
space presumes that there are other

3539.199 --> 3546.369
planets yes you know presuming a

3542.949 --> 3548.199
heliocentric model where the law second

3546.369 --> 3550.869
law of thermodynamics would be taken

3548.199 --> 3554.079
into account and if you presume that

3550.869 --> 3557.529
then there must be gas pressure in outer

3554.079 --> 3560.829
space not too far off of what we know

3557.529 --> 3562.719
here on earth yeah they said 10 to the

3560.829 --> 3567.789
negative 17 Torr that's not gonna be

3562.719 --> 3573.929
that's gonna be how do you get to make

3567.789 --> 3576.789
the rules of reality Arwen gradients

3573.929 --> 3580.869
it's how the gradient work it can't be

3576.789 --> 3582.6690000000003
that they've they fictionalized some of

3580.869 --> 3583.809
that data beyond the point because they

3582.669 --> 3586.419
never got there

3583.809 --> 3589.63
nobody got there you can't measure

3586.419 --> 3592.1189999999997
pressure over a distance you can deduce

3589.63 --> 3594.4590000000003
it based on statistics you can't

3592.119 --> 3598.4790000000003
actually physically measure it if you

3594.459 --> 3600.549
can't reach it wait so now they can't

3598.479 --> 3604.7189999999996
reach space even though there's hundreds

3600.549 --> 3607.359
and rockets don't actually work in in to

3604.719 --> 3608.679
low pressure even how do you know that

3607.359 --> 3610.12
what why do you just keep claiming

3608.679 --> 3613.39
things or when come on

3610.12 --> 3616.12
- videos of this on YouTube we've been

3613.39 --> 3617.31
all over this and we've all been through

3616.12 --> 3621.94
this

3617.31 --> 3623.4
you included Tim you've seen Rockets not

3621.94 --> 3627.2200000000003
work in space that's what you said

3623.4 --> 3629.7400000000002
nobody seen Rockets not work or work in

3627.22 --> 3632.68
space because there is no space but in a

3629.74 --> 3636.1299999999997
vacuum or a near vacuum it can't work it

3632.68 --> 3638.83
can propel can create the thrust that is

3636.13 --> 3645.75
actually the foundation of the rocket

3638.83 --> 3648.0099999999998
motion well if you get to make a change

3645.75 --> 3651.43
you're gonna win the game I guess in

3648.01 --> 3655.21
your own head or what now it no yes

3651.43 --> 3657.25
there's really this is memorized I don't

3655.21 --> 3660.73
even care at this point this is old news

3657.25 --> 3662.23
- yeah I know you don't you rather just

3660.73 --> 3666.34
believe the earth is flat with no

3662.23 --> 3668.53
evidence except for super long distant

3666.34 --> 3672.34
observations that means therefore

3668.53 --> 3675.2200000000003
Heights yeah all that like one which one

3672.34 --> 3679.48
cuz you've seen my soul autographing the

3675.22 --> 3687.73
beach on the other side with the camera

3679.48 --> 3689.95
at Ocean height literally yeah that

3687.73 --> 3692.2
curvature is a myth there's no curvature

3689.95 --> 3694.6
there's only obstruction and concealment

3692.2 --> 3697.27
and they're all a natural part of optics

3694.6 --> 3700.0299999999997
and of what's going on tidal bulges that

3697.27 --> 3704.47
do happen at the coast in relation to

3700.03 --> 3705.1600000000003
the deeper ocean so they'll bulge at the

3704.47 --> 3712.87
Great Salt Lake

3705.16 --> 3714.8799999999997
Arwen how big is it probably no no there

3712.87 --> 3719.1
shouldn't be lakes don't count it's only

3714.88 --> 3722.98
because of the contrast of the the beach

3719.1 --> 3724.63
depth ocean and the far out ocean which

3722.98 --> 3727.21
is much deeper that is what causes the

3724.63 --> 3730.6
bow tidal bulge effect so it's not going

3727.21 --> 3732.82
to be in lakes no yeah at the Great Salt

3730.6 --> 3735.5499999999997
Lake it's basically like glass water but

3732.82 --> 3737.1400000000003
Arwen you know what would it take for

3735.55 --> 3741.1000000000004
you to understand that the earth is a

3737.14 --> 3743.5
sphere at this point well it would take

3741.1 --> 3747.31
a severe shock of cognate

3743.5 --> 3750.76
dissidents and probably anxiety driven

3747.31 --> 3752.59
amnesia and then I might basically

3750.76 --> 3755.7700000000004
forget everything that I've learned and

3752.59 --> 3759.01
be able to actually believe the earth is

3755.77 --> 3761.98
a globe again but if you're not gonna

3759.01 --> 3764.5600000000004
I'm not gonna actually try to do that

3761.98 --> 3767.73
because I don't want to believe that

3764.56 --> 3770.5299999999997
[ __ ] anymore it's too embarrassing

3767.73 --> 3773.5
so looping rectangular model is better

3770.53 --> 3775.75
for you that has no quantify ability has

3773.5 --> 3778.51
no map it has no model yeah it has all

3775.75 --> 3780.7
of that and is quantified you just don't

3778.51 --> 3783.5200000000004
get it because you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3780.7 --> 3786.0099999999998
like many ballers and even some flat

3783.52 --> 3788.92
earthers just don't get it and so people

3786.01 --> 3790.9300000000003
are now actually starting to admit like

3788.92 --> 3795.25
yeah I don't get this or I don't believe

3790.93 --> 3797.14
that part but you polish you just you

3795.25 --> 3800.17
have a meltdown every time and talk

3797.14 --> 3804.8799999999997
about it where's the law and it's just

3800.17 --> 3808.3
my concept it's a potential it's

3804.88 --> 3808.9900000000002
something that could be it would like

3808.3 --> 3811.69
that

3808.99 --> 3816.12
I'm not saying it is there I say it

3811.69 --> 3819.01
could be that's theorizing it's called

3816.12 --> 3820.99
theorizing you have a conception you

3819.01 --> 3822.3100000000004
have a conception of something and you

3820.99 --> 3824.41
know you can't put it down on pen and

3822.31 --> 3828.46
paper it seems like but the globe earth

3824.41 --> 3830.29
model works for all observations yeah

3828.46 --> 3833.4700000000003
that's called jacking off to your own

3830.29 --> 3835.57
fantasies it doesn't it doesn't it

3833.47 --> 3838.4199999999996
doesn't there's just a bunch of math to

3835.57 --> 3840.82
fit quite a few things and then when you

3838.42 --> 3842.23
actually test it with actual critical

3840.82 --> 3843.94
thinking or you try to approach it with

3842.23 --> 3847.18
the scientific method it all turns out

3843.94 --> 3849.01
to be presupposition or ball [ __ ] have

3847.18 --> 3852.85
you using the scientific method with

3849.01 --> 3854.9700000000003
your conceptions Arwen nope because you

3852.85 --> 3858.43
can't use the scientific method on

3854.97 --> 3860.77
actual earth shaped related things you

3858.43 --> 3865.93
can water you get an empirical deduction

3860.77 --> 3870.91
based evidence evidence if you don't

3865.93 --> 3874.2999999999997
think that it's even possible I'm just

3870.91 --> 3876.85
saying that the heliocentric model is

3874.3 --> 3879.88
supposedly proven scientifically

3876.85 --> 3883.7799999999997
even as you say it that it is that

3879.88 --> 3886.9900000000002
absolutely and it's not it's an illusion

3883.78 --> 3888.28
that it's Bluff it's literally bluff the

3886.99 --> 3892.62
claim that that's been proven

3888.28 --> 3896.8
scientifically it's Bluff let's just say

3892.62 --> 3900.13
if if the satellite pictures are real of

3896.8 --> 3903.3700000000003
the earth would that prove the earth is

3900.13 --> 3908.71
a sphere if they are real would that

3903.37 --> 3912.43
prove the earth as a sphere that's like

3908.71 --> 3914.83
dead that's a formal logical fallacy

3912.43 --> 3916.0299999999997
oh so it's a question it is even worse

3914.83 --> 3919.45
it's like saying yeah

3916.03 --> 3923.38
if it is real would that which it is

3919.45 --> 3926.3799999999997
part of be real well if it is real it is

3923.38 --> 3927.9700000000003
real but it's not it's just a simple

3926.38 --> 3930.82
question on where I'm just know it's a

3927.97 --> 3934.2099999999996
really stupid trick question no it's not

3930.82 --> 3935.32
there's not it is is the figure is if

3934.21 --> 3938.2
this thing is real

3935.32 --> 3940.9300000000003
then is the thing that it is supposed to

3938.2 --> 3942.85
be a part of not real yeah of course it

3940.93 --> 3946.24
would be that's [ __ ] but it's not

3942.85 --> 3948.61
neither Arwen if they took real pictures

3946.24 --> 3950.74
of the earth and it was and it did

3948.61 --> 3955.54
appear to be a sphere would that be a

3950.74 --> 3957.85
proof that the earth is a sphere the pea

3955.54 --> 3959.62
and the nature of the photograph Billy

3957.85 --> 3962.5299999999997
it all depends on the nature of the

3959.62 --> 3964.8399999999997
photograph because so far of what I've

3962.53 --> 3968.8
learned it it's photoshopped because it

3964.84 --> 3971.4700000000003
has to be with no exception so there's

3968.8 --> 3973.75
oh there is many except for these well

3971.47 --> 3977.1699999999996
there's one exception supposedly and

3973.75 --> 3981.01
that is the original picture of Africa

3977.17 --> 3983.56
and Antarctica that sing or when Apollo

3981.01 --> 3986.32
17 and all these Apollo missions they

3983.56 --> 3987.85
were on the moon taking many many many

3986.32 --> 3990.76
pictures of the earth with the

3987.85 --> 3992.86
Hasselblad camera okay it's not just one

3990.76 --> 3997.0600000000004
picture that's just that's flattered at

3992.86 --> 3999.3700000000003
this info you can download and I did the

3997.06 --> 4002.13
other day it's 30 gigabytes all of the

3999.37 --> 4004.02
Apollo missions 11 through 7 mm 30

4002.13 --> 4006.09
gigabytes of pictures okay I was going

4004.02 --> 4008.81
through them it's not just one picture

4006.09 --> 4008.81
of the earth dude

4010.42 --> 4018.2490000000003
Timmy if you sin whatever happened on

4014.299 --> 4020.95
the weights of meand yeah yeah and it's

4018.249 --> 4029.39
disinfo it's not good at all

4020.95 --> 4032.5389999999998
well it's fake is it well no no saladin

4029.39 --> 4033.92
you dwell in I'm not calling you just

4032.539 --> 4036.3190000000004
saw what I'm asking you questions and

4033.92 --> 4039.9500000000003
I'm not a religious zealot because I

4036.319 --> 4042.499
don't take my model as religious I base

4039.95 --> 4044.839
my conceptualizations of what I know to

4042.499 --> 4048.23
be true what I know to be true on

4044.839 --> 4050.569
empirical data and my own observations

4048.23 --> 4052.759
it's definitely not a ball it's flat

4050.569 --> 4054.92
have you done our when I've never seen

4052.759 --> 4056.599
in your observations oh really

4054.92 --> 4059.21
well you don't get to see my

4056.599 --> 4061.4300000000003
observations thus far because there with

4059.21 --> 4063.41
these my eyes which is my best

4061.43 --> 4065.989
observation too at the time though I'm

4063.41 --> 4068.66
saving up for a four p900

4065.989 --> 4072.369
or p1000 we'll see where that gets and

4068.66 --> 4077.1499999999996
then I will do some footage absolutely

4072.369 --> 4079.549
so I have hundreds of gigs I share with

4077.15 --> 4080.9300000000003
people right and all of them has been

4079.549 --> 4084.349
modelled in maps

4080.93 --> 4087.0499999999997
it fits the sphere quarter yeah you know

4084.349 --> 4088.539
I have this big a pile of maps as well

4087.05 --> 4092.8390000000004
[Music]

4088.539 --> 4095.989
people can put a lot of work in there

4092.839 --> 4099.17
fiction okay a lot of it it sounds like

4095.989 --> 4101.15
you agree well this is about the Indy

4099.17 --> 4102.9490000000005
Maps so that was actually a trick

4101.15 --> 4105.739
question it wasn't about reality I'm

4102.949 --> 4108.44
just saying that people put a lot of

4105.739 --> 4111.709999999999
actual physical work in fictional things

4108.44 --> 4114.888999999999
so this giant pile of photos from

4111.71 --> 4120.9800000000005
satellites blah that's all fictional

4114.889 --> 4123.35
crap that's your [ __ ] yes yes all of it

4120.98 --> 4127.04
all of it have you in all of the

4123.35 --> 4129.92
pictures no I don't need to okay if you

4127.04 --> 4131.5289999999995
are but I'd love to look through your

4129.92 --> 4136.279
pile of garbage

4131.529 --> 4140.929
sure sure I would be great that's so

4136.279 --> 4142.099
nice dismissal Arwen Timmy I'm just

4140.929 --> 4144.409
knowing that's knowing

4142.099 --> 4149.2390000000005
based on sight from second law of

4144.409 --> 4150.23
thermodynamics the second law yeah I do

4149.239 --> 4155.869
I do

4150.23 --> 4157.6089999999995
yeah I do what is it entropy entropy is

4155.869 --> 4160.159
the second law of thermodynamics

4157.609 --> 4161.75
it's a colloquial version of the second

4160.159 --> 4165.079
law of thermodynamics the second law of

4161.75 --> 4167.21
thermodynamics as far as you know is gas

4165.079 --> 4169.429
pressure expanding within the available

4167.21 --> 4174.38
container until it finds an equilibrium

4169.429 --> 4176.029
and it is heat flows too cold if it has

4174.38 --> 4177.429
the opportunity in every the other way

4176.029 --> 4179.81
around

4177.429 --> 4181.79
there's bound to be some more but those

4179.81 --> 4184.400000000001
are probably the most important versions

4181.79 --> 4191.23
of it and as supposedly energy is never

4184.4 --> 4192.469
lost it just transforms in that sense oh

4191.23 --> 4194.839999999999
really

4192.469 --> 4197.9800000000005
so yeah you tell me this the law the

4194.84 --> 4204.05
second line please bring your quotes

4197.98 --> 4205.848999999999
from an official source you're just

4204.05 --> 4207.9800000000005
tonight either way you need to look into

4205.849 --> 4210.2300000000005
it yeah you're not gonna answer and

4207.98 --> 4213.86
that's your exit cue goodbye

4210.23 --> 4219.589999999999
piss off Tim wanker

4213.86 --> 4224.21
oh don't kick him oh yeah oh yeah I'm

4219.59 --> 4226.6990000000005
sick of this sick of his smart he just

4224.21 --> 4229.389
everywhere he goes she just lead like a

4226.699 --> 4232.4
ghost from ghostbusters he just leaves a

4229.389 --> 4235.34
drapes around slime and just rubs off

4232.4 --> 4239.69
it's disgusting I hate him it's a

4235.34 --> 4241.55
disgusting devious person well this is

4239.69 --> 4245.8099999999995
slightly less of a [ __ ] than he normally

4241.55 --> 4248.63
is right well that's because he's on my

4245.81 --> 4250.849
show but he still does his [ __ ] and he

4248.63 --> 4255.59
basically straight-faced lies to me

4250.849 --> 4258.29
about things and just oh he's just Tim

4255.59 --> 4260.78
and I guess for Tim it could be worse

4258.29 --> 4262.79
because I'm relatively polite but I can

4260.78 --> 4267.17
only have so much patience eventually

4262.79 --> 4271.309
I'm just oh just get out

4267.17 --> 4275.12
I'd like to hear heard him explain how

4271.309 --> 4277.1900000000005
that program was a disinfo

4275.12 --> 4280.16
he's never he doesn't answer questions

4277.19 --> 4281.96
it's just I asked him he was gonna write

4280.16 --> 4283.91
I think he was going to answer me and

4281.96 --> 4287.9
then you started going back onto the

4283.91 --> 4290.57
second or thermodynamics was actually

4287.9 --> 4292.28
doing that that's just mentioning it and

4290.57 --> 4295.61
then he said oh you don't know it

4292.28 --> 4297.889999999999
described it so I described it as far as

4295.61 --> 4299.96
I know it and I said okay is that he

4297.89 --> 4303.62
said who's wrong and then I told him

4299.96 --> 4306.41
okay so you tell me what it is and

4303.62 --> 4310.55
please bring a good official source and

4306.41 --> 4311.54
he's just said no and that's that means

4310.55 --> 4315.62
okay you get it

4311.54 --> 4317.03
a giant kick in the butt piss off if you

4315.62 --> 4319.04
first gonna claim that I got it wrong

4317.03 --> 4324.889999999999
and you don't want to correct me that

4319.04 --> 4326.66
means get out as soon as he is a swan

4324.89 --> 4329.29
see if you were 10 I look it onto the

4326.66 --> 4333.0199999999995
link yet hmm

4329.29 --> 4335.54
this he is not gonna get in so does he

4333.02 --> 4337.490000000001
know hey he's not gonna gain yeah you

4335.54 --> 4340.06
can come in if you want but he's not

4337.49 --> 4340.0599999999995
gonna get in

4341.29 --> 4347.36
come on Swansea ok thanks again by the

4344.9 --> 4349.3099999999995

chat donation a bit earlier as well so

4360.17 --> 4366.02
thanks so much for for the spread out

4363.35 --> 4368.030000000001
super chatter Nations the Omega RT much

appreciate it if you want to get on that

4368.03 --> 4373.66
would be cool you're definitely welcome

4385.53 --> 4398.969999999999
oh okay forage don't get Jose timed out

4396.21 --> 4401.52
or anything because you'll go all social

4398.97 --> 4404.25
justice warrior on me again he's no

4401.52 --> 4408.120000000001
unser being because you did that because

4404.25 --> 4410.19
he is a wanker and a [ __ ] even though he

4408.12 --> 4412.89
has a family but yeah if you keep on

4410.19 --> 4417.8099999999995
doing that kind of victim policy you're

4412.89 --> 4422.070000000001
a [ __ ] Jose so I don't really care too

4417.81 --> 4425.990000000001
much but just I know he probably didn't

4422.07 --> 4431.16
deserve it because he's very careful so

4425.99 --> 4446.49
don't don't do that if somebody's gonna

4431.16 --> 4454.11
timeout Jose it'll be me all right Billy

4446.49 --> 4456.71
you still there hello you're you're

4454.11 --> 4461.57
awfully silent

4456.71 --> 4464.58
no I heard Jose streaming of the day hmm

4461.57 --> 4465.63
he was he was quite good as a moderator

4464.58 --> 4467.73
yeah

4465.63 --> 4470.1900000000005
flat earthers were trying to talk and he

4467.73 --> 4471.99
was I think rumpus was in there and he

4470.19 --> 4474.21
was trying to do his usual rumpus and

4471.99 --> 4479.94
the hose they actually cry and it was it

4474.21 --> 4486.42
was quite good yeah Jose is a pretty

4479.94 --> 4488.8099999999995
good debating host he's of let's just

4486.42 --> 4491.88
say that Nathan is kind of like a

4488.81 --> 4493.740000000001
champion King type of hangout guy in the

4491.88 --> 4496.62
sense that he definitely controls his

4493.74 --> 4500.67
hangout it's about how he does things

4496.62 --> 4503.13
very puts a lot of energy into it Jose

4500.67 --> 4505.77
seems to be more yeah like a backdrop

4503.13 --> 4508.68
moderator that is really just managing a

4505.77 --> 4510.96
group of people shouting or talking and

4508.68 --> 4514.59
he doesn't very good he's gotten good at

4510.96 --> 4516.84
it I can respect that definitely I have

4514.59 --> 4518.52
absolutely no problem with Jose the only

4516.84 --> 4519.119000000001
thing that I really have a problem with

4518.52 --> 4521.519
is that

4519.119 --> 4524.249
every time somebody just does something

4521.519 --> 4526.289000000001
slightly wrong he starts crying like

4524.249 --> 4531.59
that like yeah basically like a little

4526.289 --> 4534.539
[ __ ] [ __ ] I'm subscribing you sense yeah

4531.59 --> 4536.219
that's really annoying and pathetic when

4534.539 --> 4539.789
you do that Jose other than that I think

4536.219 --> 4544.11
you're pretty okay guy besides being a

4539.789 --> 4545.898999999999
weird globe er the reasons why is weird

4544.11 --> 4549.329
but fine

4545.899 --> 4554.369000000001
you're okay guy you're you're welcome on

4549.329 --> 4557.148999999999
my channel but I don't like the whiny

4554.369 --> 4560.339999999999
complaining and manipulation it's really

4557.149 --> 4579.1990000000005
like a little [ __ ] so stop doing that

4560.34 --> 4579.1990000000005
please the Omega party did you do

4581.13 --> 4590.82
I am NOT oh and stop ending your

4587.13 --> 4595.17
sentences with boom or thank you that's

4590.82 --> 4596.849999999999
annoying well that I get that some

4595.17 --> 4600.93
people may find that annoying but that

4596.85 --> 4606.870000000001
is like his thing so you can't take that

4600.93 --> 4608.01
away from him no I can't it makes him

4606.87 --> 4612.86
sound like a [ __ ]

4608.01 --> 4617.49
so far up his own ass no not really

4612.86 --> 4620.07
it just it's things are little it makes

4617.49 --> 4626.76
it a little bit more laid-back that's

4620.07 --> 4630.049999999999
why it does it I think and just like

4626.76 --> 4634.68
giving an atmosphere of fooling around

4630.05 --> 4636.6900000000005
and yeah I get that some people will

4634.68 --> 4639.360000000001
find it very annoying I did kind of find

4636.69 --> 4641.4
it very annoying at first but it's

4639.36 --> 4643.98
mostly when he's like really into some

4641.4 --> 4647.19
kind of attitude and if he uses it then

4643.98 --> 4650.339999999999
then it's really annoying but other than

4647.19 --> 4652.849999999999
that now if he's just in a regular mood

4650.34 --> 4656.22
I have no problem with him at all

4652.85 --> 4660.030000000001
it's Jose Carolyn is it old is he not

4656.22 --> 4662.1900000000005
allowed mm-hmm Jose coming on boy he was

4660.03 --> 4665.849999999999

I don't see it

4922.46 --> 4927.55
and that you get the the address exactly

4926.72 --> 4931.610000000001
right

4927.55 --> 4934.9400000000005
because it's not with IJ okay it's our

4931.61 --> 4940.63
win7 don't be fooled

4934.94 --> 4940.629999999999
oh just 1w

4959.59 --> 4967.6900000000005
anyway hmm all right

4965.38 --> 4970.26
yeah there's no debate of course

4967.69 --> 4970.259999999999
Saturday

4982.76 --> 4993.29
where are you chocolate what

4999.92 --> 5013.89
wow that's a big freaking link wait

5009.76 --> 5013.89
Seth Bailey is that you

5022.15 --> 5025.95
like is that the Omega word

5026.47 --> 5029.52
[Music]

5035.659 --> 5044.669
they'll clean now film a QWERTY called

5039.449 --> 5048.199
me Arwen as in the female half elf in

5044.669 --> 5051.51
Lord of the Rings and that's not my name

5048.199 --> 5056.549
it's slightly different but the

5051.51 --> 5060.059
difference is kind of important and it

5056.549 --> 5065.989
just pronounced our win just that's the

5060.059 --> 5075.479
colloquial way to pronunciate it the

5065.989 --> 5085.709
Anglophile version or the common tongue

5075.479 --> 5089.01
as they say chocolate is probably at

5085.709 --> 5091.829
work and he's eating cereal so this area

5089.01 --> 5095.549
right you see what as far as he said he

5091.829 --> 5100.889
said he can't he sounds like he's on his

5095.549 --> 5103.53
mobile as well so he's signed in to do

5100.889 --> 5111.209
Google and it says to just again go to

5103.53 --> 5112.949
the App Store yeah it's annoying it's a

5111.209 --> 5118.409
problem with mobiles and it happens more

5112.949 --> 5120.749
often I don't know how to fix that like

5118.409 --> 5123.659
the only other way to deal with that is

5120.749 --> 5130.169
for me to basically call you up on skype

5123.659 --> 5131.909
and just add you through Skype I don't

5130.169 --> 5136.889
know why it does that it doesn't always

5131.909 --> 5138.989
do that it's just sometimes it works and

5136.889 --> 5140.549
people with their mobiles can get out

5138.989 --> 5142.468999999999
and other times it just doesn't seem to

5140.549 --> 5144.359
work for some reason I don't understand

5142.469 --> 5146.9890000000005
why that is doesn't make any damn sense

5144.359 --> 5146.9890000000005
to me

5149.929 --> 5161.2390000000005
oh sorry Theo Megawati but I didn't know

5159.92 --> 5168.2300000000005
if it that was you

5161.239 --> 5171.98
I probably should have asked it in Skype

5168.23 --> 5176.599999999999
sorry about that weird why wouldn't you

5171.98 --> 5182.219999999999
just use your Skype panel I mean your

5176.6 --> 5188.129000000001
your YouTube handle for that well sorry

5182.22 --> 5188.129
[Music]

5190.39 --> 5193.6
[Music]

5206.789 --> 5220.768999999999
oh really okay so what did you think

5216.269 --> 5222.7390000000005
about Owens Owens chat with deep beside

5220.769 --> 5227.219
the rabbit all the other thing

5222.739 --> 5231.598999999999
Owen you said oh and that could have

5227.219 --> 5233.61
been Arwen or a whirlwind with I yeah I

5231.599 --> 5236.789
thought it was interesting it was very

5233.61 --> 5240.42
typical it was exactly what I would

5236.789 --> 5242.67
expect off of that to happen and the

5240.42 --> 5245.55
energy despite this vital I was still

5242.67 --> 5255.51
very good I really liked the the

5245.55 --> 5260.1900000000005
conversation what do you think I didn't

5255.51 --> 5264.59
like it you didn't like it it was just

5260.19 --> 5264.589999999999
it's just all the usual wasn't they're

5264.65 --> 5275.25
all small steps especially with his name

5272.519 --> 5278.059
Dave David Weiss in it mm-hmm you think

5275.25 --> 5282.15
he'd be a little bit more prepared than

5278.059 --> 5285.570000000001
what he gave out you couldn't even Hank

5282.15 --> 5288.839999999999
put his phone up to the to his laptop

5285.57 --> 5290.759999999999
screen screen with that you couldn't see

5288.84 --> 5293.969
his whole phone so you couldn't see what

5290.76 --> 5296.13
he's trying to describe and just get out

5293.969 --> 5297.57
get out of them get out a whiteboard and

5296.13 --> 5298.9490000000005
start doing things on a whiteboard if

5297.57 --> 5301.199
you can't explain something properly

5298.949 --> 5303.15
like he was saying put a smiley face on

5301.199 --> 5305.57
the ceiling and then one person look on

5303.15 --> 5308.429
one side another press on the other side

5305.57 --> 5310.489
didn't never do that but that's how that

5308.429 --> 5315.179
that's how the show works

5310.489 --> 5317.4
like it wasn't Owen Benjamin watching a

5315.179 --> 5319.159
presentation of a flat earther it was

5317.4 --> 5323.009999999999
just the back and forth it was a talk

5319.159 --> 5326.098999999999
and just I don't know it wasn't supposed

5323.01 --> 5327.4490000000005
to be like that yeah but David should

5326.099 --> 5328.92
have been a bit more prepared if he knew

5327.449 --> 5330.989
he was going on to a live screen with

5328.92 --> 5333.75
Owens knowing there'd be six thousand

5330.989 --> 5336.69
people watching and it just it just

5333.75 --> 5338.969
wasn't a very good I don't think I I

5336.69 --> 5340.169999999999
don't know yeah I thought it was fluid

5338.969 --> 5342.36
at least

5340.17 --> 5344.1900000000005
you know they like maybe the technical

5342.36 --> 5347.16
side indeed it could have been better

5344.19 --> 5349.5
more detailed prepared but just as a

5347.16 --> 5353.51
show I thought it was great it was the

5349.5 --> 5356.4
energy kept flowing or no awkward

5353.51 --> 5358.7
situations or anything I don't know

5356.4 --> 5362.46
what's just I don't

5358.7 --> 5364.41
yeah maybe you just expected more you

5362.46 --> 5366.54
expected to get like the ultimate

5364.41 --> 5369.0
presentation to totally sway him

5366.54 --> 5370.59
something like that right yeah I

5369.0 --> 5372.42
supposed to be very late so many times

5370.59 --> 5375.45
before and you think oh no the same old

5372.42 --> 5379.61
same old but he's not gonna do that

5375.45 --> 5383.5199999999995
he's very direct and obvious about it

5379.61 --> 5387.179999999999
energy wise he's not gonna be a flat

5383.52 --> 5390.6900000000005
earther like really not but he will

5387.18 --> 5394.2300000000005
absolutely step in there and deal with

5390.69 --> 5396.45
it and learn about it and then may even

5394.23 --> 5401.79
say yeah they're right about things but

5396.45 --> 5403.5599999999995
I think the earth is not flat but I

5401.79 --> 5405.54
pretty much agree with almost anything

5403.56 --> 5408.54
he might go to something like that but

5405.54 --> 5414.09
he's never gonna something he's doing

5408.54 --> 5417.12
it's the his approach so yeah if anybody

5414.09 --> 5419.16
thinks they can get in or email him or

5417.12 --> 5422.91
something and then convince him to

5419.16 --> 5431.7
switch that is pure [ __ ] it's never

5422.91 --> 5434.76
gonna happen never never I reckon he's

5431.7 --> 5441.75
open enough to finally realize it is

5434.76 --> 5444.27
actually not a spinning ball well he may

5441.75 --> 5446.07
think it's a non spinning ball look

5444.27 --> 5450.900000000001
there's all kinds of directions he may

5446.07 --> 5453.0599999999995
be attuning to or trying out but he's

5450.9 --> 5455.5199999999995
not just gonna be a flat earther he

5453.06 --> 5457.860000000001
doesn't want to be he chooses not to be

5455.52 --> 5461.01
and it doesn't really have to be what

5457.86 --> 5463.44
his thing is primarily is the moon

5461.01 --> 5465.87
landing and the fakery well as he said

5463.44 --> 5468.45
in with deception of government in

5465.87 --> 5472.62
general that is like the framework of

5468.45 --> 5473.82
his project the cultural project well as

5472.62 --> 5477.09
he said he doesn't want to be a

5473.82 --> 5480.57
like ever hmm

5477.09 --> 5485.07
I agree Ragnar or I reckon he will be a

5480.57 --> 5489.179999999999
fill globe a full flat refa see Owen

5485.07 --> 5491.0599999999995
will go for global sing no it's not

5489.18 --> 5493.860000000001
gonna happen

5491.06 --> 5497.490000000001
he's not gonna he doesn't want to do it

5493.86 --> 5499.4
and it's not efficient for him to do it

5497.49 --> 5503.49
he doesn't need to do it

5499.4 --> 5505.889999999999
- still delve into the public to still

5503.49 --> 5509.46
be interesting - still find the comedic

5505.89 --> 5512.160000000001
angle to this scene and the whole

5509.46 --> 5516.78
situation of it he doesn't need to be

5512.16 --> 5518.58
and the price of literally officially

5516.78 --> 5522.63
declaring yourself a flat earth or

5518.58 --> 5525.17
somebody that high-profile in the scene

5522.63 --> 5529.16
he is in the comedic comedy scene it's

5525.17 --> 5534.18
it's unpredictable

5529.16 --> 5536.19
what'll I come out of that those Swansea

5534.18 --> 5540.030000000001
says he who in the hell would want to be

5536.19 --> 5542.54
a flat heart no one wants to be a

5540.03 --> 5542.54
flattered

5548.2 --> 5561.07
I wouldn't be a flatties - yeah the

5558.97 --> 5564.37
biggest problem about flat-earthers

5561.07 --> 5569.049999999999
in a very wide sense is that they made

5564.37 --> 5571.12
the mistake of being correct that's

5569.05 --> 5573.78
pretty much what the whole overarching

5571.12 --> 5573.78
thing is about

5582.469 --> 5590.36
it would be just it would be nice if I

5585.239 --> 5590.36
mean she had the right flatty on there

5591.38 --> 5599.900000000001
would have been nice if Eric Dubay gone

5594.449 --> 5605.209
there hmm no I don't think I don't think

5599.9 --> 5608.638999999999
Owen Benjamin isn't gonna do that no I

5605.209 --> 5616.769
don't think he wants people that are

5608.639 --> 5619.409000000001
have 78 tendencies on his shows I really

5616.769 --> 5620.969
thought that that invent there was a

5619.409 --> 5623.82
good invention or I don't know he

5620.969 --> 5626.429
probably didn't invent it meme or

5623.82 --> 5629.969
something and he he totally made it into

5626.429 --> 5637.159
like a certain type a certain cluster of

5629.969 --> 5639.51
tendencies within free media people like

5637.159 --> 5642.539
cultish like effects

5639.51 --> 5645.719
so social wise and I thought this Ivania

5642.539 --> 5648.889
was just brilliant and yeah Eric Dubay

5645.719 --> 5651.57
is a freaking stephania absolutely

5648.889 --> 5655.229
totally agree with everything Owen said

5651.57 --> 5660.409
about it what is it it's a savonius a

5655.229 --> 5665.039000000001
prima donna is it sort of it is like a a

5660.409 --> 5668.699
[ __ ] person that is pretending to be

5665.039 --> 5670.59
really cool and a leader and everybody

5668.699 --> 5674.489
worships them even though they are

5670.59 --> 5679.139
literally acting like [ __ ] that's a so

5674.489 --> 5681.959
far yes I think that's what I got from

5679.139 --> 5684.329
it everyone nice like a [ __ ] down

5681.959 --> 5686.699
again don't they yeah but not just a

5684.329 --> 5688.789
[ __ ] but you can also have like

5686.699 --> 5691.409
weird just a legal objection to it

5688.789 --> 5692.099
that's a very important detail about

5691.409 --> 5699.719
this afonya

5692.099 --> 5702.09
it's definitely gay oh yeah Eric doesn't

5699.719 --> 5704.61
do his cause much when he starts

5702.09 --> 5712.1990000000005
dressing up as women and trying to write

5704.61 --> 5716.098999999999
and he talks just talks come on

5712.199 --> 5719.28
are you saying you never never had that

5716.099 --> 5723.919
like hmm you know what Eric Dubay sounds

5719.28 --> 5726.419
kind of like a never had that ever

5723.919 --> 5728.449
because I had other constantly since the

5726.419 --> 5733.13
very first time I or I didn't speak

5728.449 --> 5733.129999999999
sounds well it sounds kind of like a gay

5733.429 --> 5743.849
or a sivan yay yeah yeah I said before

5741.63 --> 5747.149
he does sound a bit of a prima donna but

5743.849 --> 5749.669
so what you could sound a big gay as

5747.149 --> 5753.539000000001
well gay people could be fluttered like

5749.669 --> 5755.939
a but he's not openly gay he's trying to

5753.539 --> 5761.459
be like a hetero man that's all being

5755.939 --> 5766.860000000001
not gay he's pretending hello Jose hello

5761.459 --> 5769.079
hello no bones no beams oh thank you

5766.86 --> 5771.239
all right to be here I was doing three

5769.079 --> 5773.969
things I was pulling my head off my ass

5771.239 --> 5775.888999999999
while eating a cold pizza and thinking

5773.969 --> 5787.05
not to say at the end of every sentence

5775.889 --> 5788.729
boom thank you checking late maybe 15

5787.05 --> 5790.53
minutes after you studies show okay

5788.729 --> 5792.899
enough about 10 minutes here and Timmy

5790.53 --> 5794.579
was in and I wasn't going I said like

5792.899 --> 5800.84
did it I really let it speak without

5794.579 --> 5806.999
turning him look I let him speak a lot

5800.84 --> 5809.519
for my dinner he doesn't drop his team

5806.999 --> 5812.669
avoid the way he just patronizes

5809.519 --> 5814.979
naturally in his voice and eventually

5812.669 --> 5817.739
it's like okay I'm and now I'm really

5814.979 --> 5819.84
sick of it and as we converse I'm just

5817.739 --> 5821.489
slowly pushing him towards the door so

5819.84 --> 5825.1990000000005
I'll just kick him out because I can't

5821.489 --> 5825.199
stand the way he talks

5825.85 --> 5842.72
it's alright timmi timmi school timmy is

5832.76 --> 5845.320000000001
not cool maybe he's a 12 other Chinese I

5842.72 --> 5848.21
used to like him I was a Florida too

5845.32 --> 5850.099999999999
from different set of eyes and different

5848.21 --> 5853.43
way I saw it but I always liked his

5850.1 --> 5854.3
approach because to me he was what I was

5853.43 --> 5857.09
a flirt

5854.3 --> 5859.67
one if not the most honest one you know

5857.09 --> 5861.110000000001
that he was able to concede a lot of

5859.67 --> 5863.36
things like yeah that makes sense you

5861.11 --> 5865.339999999999
know analyse you know disappoint you

5863.36 --> 5871.219999999999
know slow he was very flexible on his

5865.34 --> 5874.45
arguments I agree oh and he deserve

5871.22 --> 5881.3
already condescending accent screaming

5874.45 --> 5885.22
right well technically he doesn't have

5881.3 --> 5889.99
to do that but he does it all the time

5885.22 --> 5894.650000000001
it is almost like a passive-aggressive

5889.99 --> 5897.5599999999995
habit that just won't go away and he

5894.65 --> 5900.44
constantly does it all the time he'd

5897.56 --> 5903.740000000001
never see him or hear him not do that

5900.44 --> 5907.25
and I just can't stand it it's

5903.74 --> 5909.7699999999995
disgusting play Jose could be a bit of a

5907.25 --> 5912.59
[ __ ] as well but exactly Jose on your

5909.77 --> 5917.51
stream you were you were good moderator

5912.59 --> 5920.33
yeah yeah I I try to be as neutral as

5917.51 --> 5923.39
possible and try to pay attention for

5920.33 --> 5926.15
those keys that I wanted to find out

5923.39 --> 5929.150000000001
when I was on the flatter side and many

5926.15 --> 5932.509999999999
people got some questions so I'd like to

5929.15 --> 5935.509999999999
kind of keep it on on the line on bias

5932.51 --> 5938.27
but always paying attention because they

5935.51 --> 5940.91
glow burst they got more freedom to

5938.27 --> 5943.820000000001
speak and when when I flutter to jump in

5940.91 --> 5946.16
if it's either our win versus all or

5943.82 --> 5948.679999999999
repeal philosophy around T versus all

5946.16 --> 5951.98
I'd like to warn everybody light on jump

5948.68 --> 5954.110000000001
down their throat because if not right

5951.98 --> 5957.5
in our warrior he'll speak I wanna let

5954.11 --> 5959.0199999999995
people eat in the tornado

5957.5 --> 5961.06
even the chances

5959.02 --> 5965.59
make it into a throwing Rotten Tomatoes

5961.06 --> 5968.4400000000005
contest yeah now when I am not in my

5965.59 --> 5972.37
show but when I'm on either Nathan or

5968.44 --> 5976.839999999999
other hangout if I jump in other places

5972.37 --> 5978.82
I get then I I take that off you know I

5976.84 --> 5982.03
said like now I can be me I can't I can

5978.82 --> 5984.4
be drawn I can be pushy I can I can just

5982.03 --> 5985.69
show my colors you know on my show I

5984.4 --> 5989.65
want to keep it I want to keep it

5985.69 --> 5991.54
straight to have everybody able to feel

5989.65 --> 5992.95
comfortable and participate but if I'm

5991.54 --> 5994.69
speaking and I get triggered and I get

5992.95 --> 5996.849999999999
pushed that button I gonna gonna go

5994.69 --> 5999.849999999999
crazy you know no now here I feel good I

5996.85 --> 6002.04
feel comfortable here early on Nathan is

5999.85 --> 6004.740000000001
something that I I feel in the air and

6002.04 --> 6006.48
and the ways the same way you might feel

6004.74 --> 6008.13
with teaming they condescending tone of

6006.48 --> 6010.5
voice or whatever I feel that with

6008.13 --> 6014.82
Nathan and he tried and he tells me

6010.5 --> 6022.35
something is wrong he is king in his in

6014.82 --> 6024.69
him and he definitely I don't blame

6022.35 --> 6027.150000000001
everybody it's a little bit of a lot of

6024.69 --> 6030.21
personality clashing over here that's

6027.15 --> 6033.12
why I I don't know I I see my show us a

6030.21 --> 6036.51
from a spectator point of view and try

6033.12 --> 6039.36
to keep it keep it more fluid and

6036.51 --> 6041.16
flowing more neutral you know I think

6039.36 --> 6042.54
it's getting better less yelling less

6041.16 --> 6044.22
over talking and that's what I try to

6042.54 --> 6046.55
keep and I know over talking on come on

6044.22 --> 6049.9800000000005
you know what at a time so it's alright

6046.55 --> 6053.25
you're doing good I am seeing literal

6049.98 --> 6055.709999999999
progress in the show and I'm surprised

6053.25 --> 6059.34
at how many times for example I can just

6055.71 --> 6063.0
hear rumpus speak calmly about something

6059.34 --> 6071.97
that's like a rarity and he's doing is

6063.0 --> 6074.57
like settling down almost like there is

6071.97 --> 6077.55
some kind of chemistry goes on it I

6074.57 --> 6080.58
don't know maybe it's a compost effect

6077.55 --> 6082.28
if you put enough rotten [ __ ] and fungus

6080.58 --> 6085.92
and all that together you know in a

6082.28 --> 6088.38
eventually yeah it will transform into

6085.92 --> 6091.68
nutrients for plants that grow on so

6088.38 --> 6092.4890000000005
maybe it's that I'm the feedback I guess

6091.68 --> 6094.9800000000005
on private

6092.489 --> 6097.049999999999
some Skype like oh say what you do you

6094.98 --> 6099.599999999999
let this person in or what do you let

6097.05 --> 6102.06
this person in there derail in the show

6099.6 --> 6105.030000000001
order distracting I said like and I

6102.06 --> 6107.9400000000005

6105.03 --> 6110.219

6107.94 --> 6113.489
talk troll and let's roll that's kind of

6110.219 --> 6115.02

6113.489 --> 6117.419999999999
love it when somebody tells me don't let

6115.02 --> 6119.55
this person in because it's a [ __ ] show

6117.42 --> 6122.7300000000005

6277.36 --> 6281.889
chance to come back in so the same ones

worked out people was confused yesterday

6305.709 --> 6312.03
what happened that new hangout is oh

6307.959 --> 6312.03

6313.59 --> 6320.110000000001
as long as it's working out for you Oh

6315.969 --> 6328.51

now room cuz - shut up Andy shut up when

6328.51 --> 6334.599
ruckus gets on there he has it's like he

6331.09 --> 6338.05
has time to sit there and talk you know

6334.599 --> 6340.03
and I think after a while it's like

6338.05 --> 6344.469
Jesus Christ like does this guy ever

6340.03 --> 6346.329
shut the [ __ ] up you know like I mean I

6344.469 --> 6348.849
guess he feels comfortable there talking

6346.329 --> 6352.499
all right yeah with the rumpus sometimes

6348.849 --> 6357.189
it's just like he's on meth or something

6352.499 --> 6358.419
super hyper - he's got he's got he's got

6357.189 --> 6363.13
uses he got

6358.419 --> 6365.639
it's a thing that he needs to to speak

6363.13 --> 6370.51
he needs to explain things easier

6365.639 --> 6372.28
something inside him is that he heating

6370.51 --> 6374.38
he has to do it that way I said what was

6372.28 --> 6376.119
know sometimes you gotta just just let

6374.38 --> 6377.7390000000005
it go sometimes you're speaking and you

6376.119 --> 6380.768999999999
might not be able to finish your thought

6377.739 --> 6382.419
let it go man let's be humble I know he

6380.769 --> 6384.849
can not take that he have to finish the

6382.419 --> 6388.148999999999
topper this is getting better yet it's

6384.849 --> 6393.999
sealing chocolate what do you think

6388.149 --> 6398.6990000000005
about windstream is Dave advice uh it

6393.999 --> 6404.919
was cool I guess was it anything

6398.699 --> 6406.509999999999
fascinating nothing new you know so not

6404.919 --> 6409.209
for us that have been in sedition

6406.51 --> 6411.88
already it's just I guess just listening

6409.209 --> 6415.719
to him talk to a fighter through I guess

6411.88 --> 6418.719
was the whole big thing right but we

6415.719 --> 6421.63
already know all that it's just this

6418.719 --> 6424.03
journey that he's going through which is

6421.63 --> 6425.079
fine I mean he said he's you know I

6424.03 --> 6427.329
don't

6425.079 --> 6429.938999999999
I heard what Arlen said before I don't

6427.329 --> 6433.148999999999
think he I don't know I mean I don't

6429.939 --> 6436.059
know the guy at all so I can't speak for

6433.149 --> 6437.919000000001
him or whatever but I you know he seen

6436.059 --> 6439.599
he's the guy it was like oh I don't want

6437.919 --> 6443.26
to be a fighter of Persons it's just so

6439.599 --> 6445.419
stupid you know and in some ways I kind

6443.26 --> 6447.909000000001
of get that but you already said I'm a

6445.419 --> 6450.3
globe skeptic and you know that's fine

6447.909 --> 6453.129999999999
as far as I'm concerned I don't really

6450.3 --> 6456.669
care what somebody chooses to call

6453.13 --> 6459.249
themselves you know if they want to be a

6456.669 --> 6461.709
flat earther globe skeptic or baller I

6459.249 --> 6464.739
mean I don't care I think you know just

6461.709 --> 6467.699
don't push your spank ball on me and

6464.739 --> 6470.138999999999
we'll be all right yeah but you know

6467.699 --> 6472.598999999999
that's the way I see it but for him I

6470.139 --> 6476.979
mean at school I mean there are things

6472.599 --> 6479.769
he want he's talking about it he gets

6476.979 --> 6482.439
you know kind of off he doesn't really

6479.769 --> 6485.349
get I mean he's still saying things like

6482.439 --> 6488.4890000000005
you know planes are not flying in that

6485.349 --> 6490.719
sphere that was weird to me but okay

6488.489 --> 6492.098999999999
Chickie's though he's still coming

6490.719 --> 6496.51
around to this [ __ ] so

6492.099 --> 6498.400000000001
I give all the time for it you know but

6496.51 --> 6502.719
it it does kind of make sense though

6498.4 --> 6504.73
right that he would simply not like let

6502.719 --> 6511.539
himself be tagged as a flat earther

6504.73 --> 6514.989
because some of those people will just

6511.539 --> 6517.929
exercise him if he does that just say

6514.989 --> 6520.419999999999
okay yeah you you're doing that doors

6517.929 --> 6523.03
are closed now I mean didn't I mean I'm

6520.42 --> 6525.34
sure he lost you know subs or whatever

6523.03 --> 6528.009999999999
just after talking about the moon

6525.34 --> 6530.679
landings let alone fire moon landings

6528.01 --> 6532.059
alone he probably lost you know people

6530.679 --> 6534.67
were just like what the hell is this guy

6532.059 --> 6536.829000000001
talking about so I can't follow him

6534.67 --> 6540.46
anymore cuz we damn well walked on the

6536.829 --> 6544.869
moon sick okay you want to believe that

6540.46 --> 6548.849
enjoy but it's funny like we walked in I

6544.869 --> 6548.848999999999
really did you walk on the moon did you

6554.55 --> 6561.3
yeah is he funny I mean a funny guy I

6557.889 --> 6567.01
know I seen phony more explaining like

6561.3 --> 6569.639
phony like a professional comedian but

6567.01 --> 6569.639
is he funny

6571.26 --> 6577.42
this thing is sacred cost cau

6574.51 --> 6579.34
slaughterhouse so he talks is naughty

6577.42 --> 6583.059
he's a naughty comedian that talks about

6579.34 --> 6586.32
things very bluntly in a way that you're

6583.059 --> 6589.75
not supposed to talk about basically so

6586.32 --> 6591.73
yeah the way comedians used to be wait

6589.75 --> 6594.789
that's the way excuse through that

6591.73 --> 6596.888999999999
comedy used to be people talking police

6594.789 --> 6599.369
you know speak now they speak you're not

6596.889 --> 6602.889
given a [ __ ] making laugh about it so

6599.369 --> 6604.719
again I like John's version but in in

6602.889 --> 6606.579
the you know in the comedic side

6604.719 --> 6610.42
something like that like he speak a lot

6606.579 --> 6614.049999999999
of truth even between jokes now he is

6610.42 --> 6616.4800000000005
pure he's making comedy with the truth

6614.05 --> 6619.599
with the truth out he sees it he has a

6616.48 --> 6622.509999999999
certain focus also spiritual very much

6619.599 --> 6624.42
but not details about scriptures too

6622.51 --> 6630.9400000000005
much is

6624.42 --> 6632.65
yeah yeah really happy early haven't

6630.94 --> 6634.75
haven't follow him haven't seen him I

6632.65 --> 6639.46
scrolled through the interview with the

6634.75 --> 6642.07
with dirt the other day and I know I saw

6639.46 --> 6644.59
maybe two minutes total in scrolling

6642.07 --> 6645.91
really not interested I find involved

6644.59 --> 6648.04
you know their arguments the

6645.91 --> 6649.42
presentation like he's doing a

6648.04 --> 6651.5199999999995
plantation I know what he's gonna

6649.42 --> 6653.32
present I just don't know what the only

6651.52 --> 6655.150000000001
guy is made of I'm you know I might have

6653.32 --> 6656.71
an opinion on him maybe in the next few

6655.15 --> 6659.5
days are gonna try to find an older

6656.71 --> 6662.92
video of him maybe a stand-up comic

6659.5 --> 6664.69
comedy act or something and I'll get an

6662.92 --> 6666.61
idea but I want to see something back in

6664.69 --> 6672.099999999999
the day from a few years ago see working

6666.61 --> 6675.19
well few years ago he was still very

6672.1 --> 6677.200000000001
much into yeah screwing around with

6675.19 --> 6681.419999999999
liberals and he still is kind of but

6677.2 --> 6684.639999999999
he's now more basically like for example

6681.42 --> 6689.02
yes screwing around but like in a kind

6684.64 --> 6691.51
of it's his signature joke Muslim jokes

6689.02 --> 6694.81
Hollywood about it lacks about

6691.51 --> 6698.17
everything about Jews a lot and says

6694.81 --> 6700.84
this makes the wrong jokes in the right

6698.17 --> 6704.53
way that it's still wrong but it's funny

6700.84 --> 6706.360000000001
it's the comedy is an art and probably

6704.53 --> 6712.66
people out there that just don't like it

6706.36 --> 6714.759999999999
and I really like it so if yeah my sense

6712.66 --> 6717.04
of humor would be sarcastic and not

6714.76 --> 6718.63
naughty a little bit you know so much

6717.04 --> 6720.5199999999995
maybe he's got that approach or

6718.63 --> 6723.31
something like that it depends what the

6720.52 --> 6725.650000000001
sense of humor the person is darker or a

6723.31 --> 6728.320000000001
little lighter or pinkish so maybe he's

6725.65 --> 6730.719999999999
got this dark sarcastic sense of he has

6728.32 --> 6734.83
like an overkill alpha-male type

6730.72 --> 6737.71
attitude like overkill like yeah being

6734.83 --> 6742.33
he's very manly that's what he's trying

6737.71 --> 6744.43
to do in a genuine way and emphasizing

6742.33 --> 6750.87
relations it's very old-fashioned in

6744.43 --> 6750.87
many directions and no

6751.66 --> 6757.969
yeah either like him or you don't I I

6754.55 --> 6761.2390000000005
think he's awesome and I like he's also

6757.969 --> 6765.05
a musician and good and he understands

6761.239 --> 6767.718999999999
music he teaches about influences about

6765.05 --> 6769.9400000000005
media influence how music influences you

6767.719 --> 6772.16
how media can influence you and like

6769.94 --> 6776.178999999999
gives demonstrations with that it's very

6772.16 --> 6779.3
effective he's a great teacher as a

6776.179 --> 6780.92
comedian the only thing I'll say about

6779.3 --> 6783.820000000001
him is that there are tons on this

6780.92 --> 6786.5
thing's one and I give him props because

6783.82 --> 6788.42
he would ask you know when he's talking

6786.5 --> 6789.59
about either the moon landings were you

6788.42 --> 6791.51
know shape of the earth

6789.59 --> 6794.360000000001
he would ask the same questions that I

6791.51 --> 6796.429
would ask you know that I was asking

6794.36 --> 6798.53
when I was younger you know the other

6796.429 --> 6800.719
day he was talking about satellites and

6798.53 --> 6805.67
now there are all these satellites up

6800.719 --> 6807.56
there but none of them just you know go

6805.67 --> 6809.51
out of service you know none of them

6807.56 --> 6811.370000000001
shut down I did none of them hit each

6809.51 --> 6813.530000000001
other they're all the way around like

6811.37 --> 6815.989
perfectly synchronized reference you

6813.53 --> 6818.8099999999995
know and nothing ever happens then you

6815.989 --> 6820.759999999999
never see one fall out of the sky you

6818.81 --> 6825.110000000001
know all the orbits are completely

6820.76 --> 6827.21
perfect and it's ridiculous how you know

6825.11 --> 6829.099999999999
it's questions like that [ __ ] like that

6827.21 --> 6831.71
that I've been asking myself for years

6829.1 --> 6833.84
so I hear that I'm like okay you know

6831.71 --> 6836.27
this is somebody who just has common

6833.84 --> 6838.76
sense okay and thinks about certain

6836.27 --> 6841.13
things you know it's not all true though

6838.76 --> 6844.4890000000005
satellites do sometimes fall out of the

6841.13 --> 6850.01
sky one here in the balloon tips that's

6844.489 --> 6851.78
to a balloon I know you know I used to

6850.01 --> 6853.88
say that you usable like how are these

6851.78 --> 6856.04
things all up there and they're just

6853.88 --> 6859.04
flying around each other and somewhere

6856.04 --> 6861.679
in geosynchronous orbits oh my god and

6859.04 --> 6863.7699999999995
none of them hit each other none of them

6861.679 --> 6867.17
ever you know go out there's not a dick

6863.77 --> 6869.900000000001
lights went out so there's no genetic

6867.17 --> 6870.85
you know why do we have one of those

6869.9 --> 6873.32
days

6870.85 --> 6875.360000000001
everything is just perfect like when we

6873.32 --> 6878.09
need to be human beings are just that on

6875.36 --> 6880.3099999999995
point like things like we can just get

6878.09 --> 6883.32
to the moon the first time around one

6880.31 --> 6888.110000000001
shot you know my province you

it's like in the 2 o'clock position in

6984.48 --> 6989.4
the sky if I'm looking straight up would

6986.55 --> 6991.320000000001

7005.36 --> 7008.48
just as rising as it is right over you

7007.64 --> 7013.34
or where is it

7008.48 --> 7015.489
oh no it's it's well at to the waist but

is it close by to horizon then or

7015.489 --> 7025.428999999999
or in dyads it's it's very high up to

7019.46 --> 7030.08
the northwest okay hey Jose where was it

7025.429 --> 7032.21
yeah if you look straight up on what's

7030.08 --> 7034.3099999999995
on your noon if the Sun wasn't your noon

7032.21 --> 7036.76
I look to the right a little bit like

7034.31 --> 7039.889
the two o'clock and it's right there oh

7036.76 --> 7041.469
yeah I saw you the other side of the

7039.889 --> 7049.150000000001
planet how can that be

7041.469 --> 7056.08
it's not a planet yet Sorry Sorry mate

7049.15 --> 7058.94
choice Jo I see Jose Jose sorry about um

7056.08 --> 7063.199
the moon is south from us right now

7058.94 --> 7067.96
Oh Georgia Florida well Jose yourself

7063.199 --> 7070.489
from me because I'm in Georgia so no yes

7067.96 --> 7079.57
here in Georgia during your are in

7070.489 --> 7083.69
Florida yeah and we can all see the moon

7079.57 --> 7087.949
that's really weird it's not supposed to

7083.69 --> 7089.86
be on the other side if it's in Florida

7087.949 --> 7092.98
on the other side

7089.86 --> 7096.0199999999995
how can it be roughly in the same angle

7092.98 --> 7098.839999999999
visually weld some disposed to the other

7096.02 --> 7099.9490000000005
side of the law I woke up about six

7098.84 --> 7101.84
o'clock this morning

7099.949 --> 7109.57
and when I went outside the moon was

7101.84 --> 7113.12
about a bit north not north east for me

7109.57 --> 7116.389
you know how it it's not in the same

7113.12 --> 7119.9
it's a completely different angle that's

7116.389 --> 7123.29
how you said it was high up and Jose

7119.9 --> 7125.659
pretty much said it as well so it can't

7123.29 --> 7128.26
be too far with away from being

7125.659 --> 7131.78
supposedly straight above you

7128.26 --> 7134.4800000000005
yet you both are on well almost

7131.78 --> 7138.29
literally opposite sides of the supposed

7134.48 --> 7141.349999999999
ball both near but continent and South

7138.29 --> 7145.2699999999995
and the other side so how can that moon

7141.35 --> 7147.77
be roughly at the same angle above you

7145.27 --> 7149.68
yeah but I won it shouldn't it be

7147.77 --> 7153.92
exactly on the

7149.68 --> 7157.240000000001
980 degree opposite no I

7153.92 --> 7159.97
Alan this is where we come to the

7157.24 --> 7162.889999999999
difference in between the distances

7159.97 --> 7170.96
right there I see the moon right there

7162.89 --> 7172.58
yeah okay can you point your camera so

7170.96 --> 7179.93

7250.79 --> 7254.54
yeah the mone somewhere in there I

7252.44 --> 7257.5599999999995

7254.54 --> 7261.7
face but I think you can see there oh

7257.56 --> 7266.4800000000005
yeah unless I see it I see it I think

7261.7 --> 7269.63

7284.449 --> 7289.4
see if I was wanting unknown the moon is

7287.42 --> 7290.63
a little bit to the right but a little

7289.4 --> 7295.489
lower right there

7290.63 --> 7299.4400000000005

7411.88 --> 7415.45
close your eyes and then after five

7413.98 --> 7421.12
seconds do you know that you're on an

7415.45 --> 7425.83

7421.12 --> 7428.5
that you're on an escalator do you know

7425.83 --> 7434.38
you don't ya if the escalators moving

still feel it no all right we know now

7434.38 --> 7440.62
you don't I don't like when you're on an

7437.23 --> 7444.4
escalator when you're more okay say

let's say you're going on a on a I am

7444.4 --> 7449.08

7483.769 --> 7494.869000000001
put on to a escalator change the

7492.65 --> 7496.999
scenario just to put me back on another

7494.869 --> 7500.57
escalator and ask me the same question

7496.999 --> 7502.4
your eyes are closed if you maybe saw my

7500.57 --> 7505.549999999999
eyes are closed on another escalator in

which I do feel you know you don't feel

7505.55 --> 7511.070000000001

7511.07 --> 7515.84
once you stand oscillator I feel that

7514.189 --> 7517.820000000001
I'm on an escalator doesn't matter if I

7515.84 --> 7520.249
close my eyes and imagine them somewhere

7517.82 --> 7521.959
else I'm still moving on the escalator I

7520.249 --> 7524.749
still feel it yeah I'm gonna keep my

7521.959 --> 7527.659
eyes open cuz I don't want to trip was

there is exactly what chocolate is just

7534.59 --> 7540.849
felt Thank You Owen thank you for that

7542.05 --> 7546.979
feed in a constant straight line speed

7544.909 --> 7549.53
which escalators do then you yeah

7546.979 --> 7552.110000000001
eventually if you go in that stable

7549.53 --> 7554.659
speed and you just I wonder you don't

7552.11 --> 7561.438999999999
technically feel it you experienced it

7554.659 --> 7564.228999999999
but I wouldn't stop talking you're just

7561.439 --> 7566.9890000000005
answering the question that you don't

7564.229 --> 7570.249000000001
want the answer so just really just try

7566.989 --> 7573.888999999999
not you've just answered the question

7570.249 --> 7575.389
well I'm not a religious zealot so if

7573.889 --> 7576.889
something is I'm not saying you're

7575.389 --> 7578.63
religious I'm not saying you're

7576.889 --> 7581.959
religious Alwyn but you've just answered

7578.63 --> 7583.939
the scientific question that your other

7581.959 --> 7589.489
mates don't want you to answer so just

7583.939 --> 7592.219
stop talking scientific question I which

7589.489 --> 7592.938999999999
are we are we traveling are we travel in

7592.219 --> 7596.2390000000005
a straight line

7592.939 --> 7598.280000000001
Oh what if the escalators on a

7596.239 --> 7600.558999999999
roundabout you going on along the

7598.28 --> 7603.21
escalator at bars going around as well

7600.559 --> 7613.17
do you know the hell just tell me this

7603.21 --> 7615.72
beause i belly right so though how can

7613.17 --> 7617.25
you compare feeling an escalator or not

7615.72 --> 7619.14
feeling it because it moves in a

7617.25 --> 7622.82
straight line understand how can you

7619.14 --> 7625.59
compare that with a centripetal

7622.82 --> 7628.049999999999
situation like these supposed spinning I

7625.59 --> 7630.81
don't I don't have two hundred thousand

7628.05 --> 7632.820000000001
subscribers just waiting for you to make

7630.81 --> 7634.76
this escalator the size of Earth and

7632.82 --> 7638.849999999999
then ask me at the same [ __ ] question

7634.76 --> 7641.070000000001
no basically I'm not gonna answer these

7638.85 --> 7644.79
questions because I don't have the

7641.07 --> 7647.37
almost or of the question right no this

7644.79 --> 7650.5199999999995
is scrub a basis been there for you to

7647.37 --> 7655.5
do it and you can't do it and I'm not

7650.52 --> 7660.21
gonna do it because I'm like I'm not

7655.5 --> 7662.19
getting paid to teach how about just you

7660.21 --> 7664.71
got on the panel so why not just answer

7662.19 --> 7667.7
questions come on I answer questions I

7664.71 --> 7671.7300000000005
just did it and you berated me for it

7667.7 --> 7673.889999999999
weirdly enough what did I write you

7671.73 --> 7676.16
about I would about that I answered the

7673.89 --> 7679.05
question that I supposedly wasn't

7676.16 --> 7684.66
allowed to answer according to my mates

7679.05 --> 7687.18
so you claim just imagine getting on the

7684.66 --> 7689.099999999999
roundabout you haven't had any drinks

7687.18 --> 7691.320000000001
you sound the horse on the roundabout

7689.1 --> 7693.02
and it's spinning you shut your eyes do

7691.32 --> 7698.16
you still feel that you're spinning

7693.02 --> 7700.35
no you are you don't know you're

7698.16 --> 7700.74
spinning on a roundabout with your eyes

7700.35 --> 7708.6
shut

7700.74 --> 7710.88
oh yeah I think you do yes you're doing

7708.6 --> 7712.77
in the freight world because the flight

7710.88 --> 7714.6
world's stationary where you doin any

7712.77 --> 7716.88
what world doesn't matter what the shape

7714.6 --> 7718.35
is on a roundabout you don't feel it

7716.88 --> 7721.26
because there's sin there's a

7718.35 --> 7727.46
centrifugal motion going on so you feel

7721.26 --> 7730.2300000000005
the centripetal forces you'll be 400 1

7727.46 --> 7734.04
you're a big fan of Ace Ventura movies

7730.23 --> 7736.07
aren't you alrighty then

7734.04 --> 7736.07
Oh

7737.01 --> 7749.9490000000005
Allen yes your mate Nathan Thompson

7744.36 --> 7752.739
keeps bringing up and what isn't Nathan

7749.949 --> 7753.96
Thompson what is or any guys what's his

7752.739 --> 7758.19
top

7753.96 --> 7761.05
what's his top proof of the Flat Earth

7758.19 --> 7761.759999999999
it's just you it's in the last few

7761.05 --> 7766.3
months

7761.76 --> 7770.92
well for me it's still the now concealed

7766.3 --> 7775.03
linear rate of the concealment versus

7770.92 --> 7779.159
distance still geometric deduction that

7775.03 --> 7783.79
is awesome that is really good thank you

7779.159 --> 7785.799999999999
um but the worst proof he brings up and

7783.79 --> 7786.159
I keep telling them stop talking about

7785.8 --> 7789.4890000000005
it

7786.159 --> 7789.989
stop saying it can you guess what that

7789.489 --> 7796.049999999999
is

7789.989 --> 7800.589999999999
nope surprise me guess pressure

7796.05 --> 7805.38
all right gas pressure can't exist

7800.59 --> 7809.2300000000005
without a container right exactly yeah

7805.38 --> 7810.159000000001
do you do I want do you understand that

7809.23 --> 7814.718999999999
yeah

7810.159 --> 7820.78
yes I do very much tell that dude to

7814.719 --> 7822.79
stop my spreading it oh why why you

7820.78 --> 7825.67
don't like that argument Joss what's

7822.79 --> 7828.429
what's wrong I don't like it because

7825.67 --> 7830.02
it's the most dumbest thing you could

7828.429 --> 7832.179
either you think we're just flying

7830.02 --> 7836.650000000001
around gas pressure and vacuum and

7832.179 --> 7838.869
that's okay what's dumb about it okay I

7836.65 --> 7840.759999999999
when do we do we really want to talk

7838.869 --> 7842.589999999999
about this yeah you just claimed it was

7840.76 --> 7849.25
done so I don't know what is dumb about

7842.59 --> 7851.889
it okay well can um can you bring the

7849.25 --> 7856.21
old night that was just talking now

7851.889 --> 7859.96
let's have a chat okay

7856.21 --> 7861.909
you mean chocolate yeah chocolates ever

7859.96 --> 7866.82
talk about it okay chocolate you want to

7861.909 --> 7871.889999999999
discuss gas pressure with jazz economy

7866.82 --> 7874.46
he won because he can really chocolate

7871.89 --> 7876.42
says what the hell you talking about man

7874.46 --> 7877.71
you're the one who brought it up you

7876.42 --> 7879.35
want to talk about it talk about it I

7877.71 --> 7882.75
don't give a [ __ ] I'm right here

7879.35 --> 7885.93
Smith's a tree bring me right here dude

7882.75 --> 7890.79
talk dude dude you don't understand it

7885.93 --> 7892.47
so let's discuss it well okay first how

7890.79 --> 7894.84
about you go into why it's such a

7892.47 --> 7898.110000000001
horrible argument for this Nathan

7894.84 --> 7901.02
Thompson oh no no you answered a

7898.11 --> 7905.73
question it's not a horrible argument

7901.02 --> 7908.97
it's a horrible thing that you cannot

7905.73 --> 7910.349999999999
understand it's not a pressure it's not

7908.97 --> 7913.35
a reason

7910.35 --> 7916.47
really it's not yes pressure it's a

7913.35 --> 7918.990000000001
pressure gradient that's still gas

7916.47 --> 7923.7
pressure though it's not just a gradient

7918.99 --> 7925.679999999999
within the come far K okay so treated

7923.7 --> 7926.94
this object I'll believe in half an hour

7925.68 --> 7929.85
ago remember

7926.94 --> 7932.639999999999
or maybe you don't I wouldn't you don't

7929.85 --> 7936.06
because a pressure gradient has got

7932.64 --> 7940.2300000000005
nothing to do with gas pressure not a

7936.06 --> 7945.240000000001
single [ __ ] thing oh it's another

7940.23 --> 7946.53
part of just how its divided but it's

7945.24 --> 7949.05
still gas pressure

7946.53 --> 7953.429999999999
it's the gradient is still the gas

7949.05 --> 7957.59
pressure no it's not yes what does that

7953.43 --> 7960.150000000001
gas pressure ingredient made out of Hey

7957.59 --> 7963.33
okay so this is what what is it made of

7960.15 --> 7966.99
I stuck with it what is the pressure

7963.33 --> 7970.22
gradient made out of jazz okay

7966.99 --> 7975.57
sorry what's your name chocolate um yes

7970.22 --> 7977.820000000001
okay so at at sea level and the southern

7975.57 --> 7980.49
hemisphere what why are we talking about

7977.82 --> 7982.92
I'm asking you what is this pressure

7980.49 --> 7985.7699999999995
that you're talking about what is it

7982.92 --> 7988.05
made out of what kind of pressure

7985.77 --> 7992.76
gradient are we talking about holy

7988.05 --> 7994.26
[ __ ] [ __ ] yeah we're talking well why

7992.76 --> 7995.79
don't you just answer the question you

7994.26 --> 7999.74
don't have to say hold I'm trying to

7995.79 --> 8004.85
soak and you can't handle it

7999.74 --> 8007.429999999999
okay death okay ready

8004.85 --> 8010.160000000001
here we go that Wesley goodnight yeah we

8007.43 --> 8013.01
good yeah yeah just a question don't

8010.16 --> 8015.68
analogize just answer the question

8013.01 --> 8019.9400000000005
okay bunny right onto it we're on to it

8015.68 --> 8023.990000000001
right now mate I'm so right what is the

8019.94 --> 8026.589999999999
gradient consistent oh this is and and

8023.99 --> 8028.76
this is this is gonna blow your mind and

8026.59 --> 8029.96
please don't interrupt because we're

8028.76 --> 8033.71
gonna have to start with the southern

8029.96 --> 8040.25
hemisphere we're in the southern

8033.71 --> 8044.42
hemisphere the pressure gradient starts

8040.25 --> 8047.27
at the international standard pressure

8044.42 --> 8056.09
throughout the whole globe North and

8047.27 --> 8061.09
South is 1013 hit two Pascal's or twenty

8056.09 --> 8064.42
nine point two nine inches of mercury

8061.09 --> 8074.900000000001
that's the Northern Hemisphere standard

8064.42 --> 8077.12
measurement harlot so no that's not the

8074.9 --> 8078.65
gradient oh right answer the question

8077.12 --> 8080.3
then you said you were gonna take the

8078.65 --> 8083.03
time to answer your question I'll let

8080.3 --> 8086.63
you say your thing it's not a guy to the

8083.03 --> 8089.389999999999
question that's amazing that's amazing I

8086.63 --> 8093.59
went so I got I just told you what the

8089.39 --> 8102.26
southern in normal hemisphere was the

8093.59 --> 8103.82
control was basically no what are you

8102.26 --> 8106.820000000001
talk thanks for the proof of the

8103.82 --> 8109.49
gradient so for that sort of a sphere

8106.82 --> 8111.44
that's awesome that's [ __ ] awesome

8109.49 --> 8114.29
so can you ask okay to answering like

8111.44 --> 8117.41
why did I guess pressure sorry what is

8114.29 --> 8120.35
the gradient this is dope aside yes

8117.41 --> 8123.47
Persia guessed Persia has nothing so

8120.35 --> 8125.39
what is your alternative to what you're

8123.47 --> 8128.780000000001
gonna have to use if you want to answer

8125.39 --> 8132.700000000001
the question what else to be ready in

8128.78 --> 8136.179999999999
the consistent alternative our it's a

8132.7 --> 8140.83
fact it's called gas pressure right

8136.18 --> 8144.79
that's that's why every single friggin

8140.83 --> 8149.14
pilot in the world that flies private or

8144.79 --> 8152.88
commercial or airline and you guys say

8149.14 --> 8154.12
ah I've got a guy that thinks he is flat

8152.88 --> 8157.06
[ __ ]

8154.12 --> 8161.7699999999995
if you've got a pilot that thinks this

8157.06 --> 8164.14
flat you could give them to me okay you

8161.77 --> 8165.490000000001
have no problem with that you'll have no

8164.14 --> 8168.070000000001
problem with that

8165.49 --> 8169.389999999999
sure this one's plenty absolutely no

8168.07 --> 8172.42
problem but thank you for answering

8169.39 --> 8175.39
question indeed the gradient is

8172.42 --> 8177.04
consistent of gas pressure and there's a

8175.39 --> 8180.25
funny thing about it whatever those

8177.04 --> 8183.73
great gas pressure involved there how

8180.25 --> 8186.19
would the gas the natural and in some of

8183.73 --> 8189.58
gas pressure to expand within the

8186.19 --> 8192.219
container available until a gradient has

8189.58 --> 8197.4
or sorry until a equilibrium has been

8192.219 --> 8205.509999999998
met and then other things happen so

8197.4 --> 8209.619999999999
thank you dr. M you just know muted him

8205.51 --> 8212.460000000001
it wasn't me Oh an hour and I'm sorry do

8209.62 --> 8217.6
you know what a pressure gradient is yes

8212.46 --> 8224.109999999999
what is it it's a difference in pressure

8217.6 --> 8226.36
overall divided in specific section its

8224.11 --> 8231.04
Godwin's agreed it's a spectrum of

8226.36 --> 8235.42
pressure it is so Allen one thing I want

8231.04 --> 8242.53
to ask you as hell in the freakin flying

8235.42 --> 8245.53
world if later tha's think gas pressure

8242.53 --> 8250.66
is an argument it's not it's the dumbest

8245.53 --> 8253.02
thing you could come up with well how

8250.66 --> 8253.02
say you

8254.65 --> 8260.479
[Music]

8257.859 --> 8262.309000000001
you know jaws if you could prove that it

8260.479 --> 8265.0
actually happened then it wouldn't be so

8262.309 --> 8267.018999999998
dumb what now would it

8265.0 --> 8268.609
holy [ __ ] [ __ ]

8267.019 --> 8270.649
thank yourselves do you think it's so

8268.609 --> 8273.5
stupid but you basically admit ya

8270.649 --> 8275.96
gradient it's gas pressure and still

8273.5 --> 8277.849
stands the general function of gas

8275.96 --> 8280.219
pressure and that is expanding within

8277.849 --> 8284.239
the container until when equilibrium is

8280.219 --> 8287.899
met that's still there it's still part

8284.239 --> 8290.539999999999
of the natural laws and if in this case

8287.899 --> 8295.159
definitely involving gas pressure it's

8290.54 --> 8301.849
there it's been established so I don't

8295.159 --> 8304.909
see why it's so dumb and let you see how

8301.849 --> 8306.62
do we still have this atmosphere to know

8304.909 --> 8309.229
how do we still have this guys freshmen

8306.62 --> 8310.849
we're talking about while we're flying

8309.229 --> 8312.67
around in a vacuum could you tell me

8310.849 --> 8315.769
that

8312.67 --> 8317.33
sorry I've got very basic instruments

8315.769 --> 8322.519
right in front of me right now

8317.33 --> 8326.599
Jacklyn chocolates am I talking to you

8322.519 --> 8328.969000000001
see pinched I'm asking you how do we

8326.599 --> 8333.519
have this gas pressure this atmosphere

8328.969 --> 8336.649
around us on this planet quote-unquote

8333.519 --> 8341.689
flying around in a vacuum how do we have

8336.649 --> 8347.929
that basically we don't have this vacuum

8341.689 --> 8352.639000000001
we don't have this planet that the

8347.929 --> 8354.559
atmosphere is flying around in the

8352.639 --> 8355.839999999998
atmosphere and that's proven because

8354.559 --> 8357.009999999998
it's proven everyday

8355.84 --> 8359.54
[Music]

8357.01 --> 8363.279
the atmosphere is flying around the
